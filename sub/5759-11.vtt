WEBVTT

00:01.430 --> 00:03.227
PREVIOUSLY
ON PRETI'Y LITI'LE LIARS...

00:03.270 --> 00:05.067
( screams )
MOM!

00:05.100 --> 00:08.092
WILDEN WAS OBSESSED
WITH TRYING TO PIN
ALISON'S MURDER ON MY FRIENDS.

00:08.140 --> 00:10.131
MONA MADE A FULL CONFESSION.

00:10.170 --> 00:12.809
DID YOU GIRLS PUT HER UP
TO THIS...THINKING IT
WOULD SOMEHOW HELP ASHLEY?

00:12.840 --> 00:14.478
Spencer: WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE
THAT SHE DIDN'T DO IT?

00:14.510 --> 00:16.102
Veronica: THINGS SHE
SAID IN HER CONFESSION

00:16.150 --> 00:18.106
CONTRADICT
SOME OF THE EVIDENCE.

00:18.150 --> 00:20.311
YOU WEREN'T LISTED AS HIS FATHER
ON HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

00:20.350 --> 00:22.147
I DON'T...HAVE ANY RIGHTS?

00:22.190 --> 00:24.112
NOT UNTIL YOU
ESTABLISH PATERNITY.

00:24.150 --> 00:25.378
WE HAVE TO FACE FACTS.

00:25.420 --> 00:27.388
3,000 MILES IS A LONG WAY.

00:27.420 --> 00:28.785
WE'RE NOT GONNA
BE TOGETHER NEXT YEAR.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.550
Toby: DR. PALMER
SAID TO WATCH OUT
FOR THE BLONDE GIRL.

00:31.590 --> 00:33.399
ANY CHANCE THAT HE MEANT CECE?

00:33.430 --> 00:36.092
Veronica: YOU CAN'T LEAVE
THE HOUSE UNLESS IT'S
FOR A COURT DATE

00:36.130 --> 00:38.496
OR A MEDICAL APPOINTMENT?
THAT...TRACKS WHERE I AM.

00:38.530 --> 00:40.236
( sobbing )
OH, MY GOD!

00:40.270 --> 00:41.669
JENNA?

00:41.700 --> 00:43.406
Aria: DID SOMEBODY
PUSH HER IN?

00:43.440 --> 00:45.067
THINK SOMEBODY HIT HER FIRST.

00:45.110 --> 00:46.099
FEEL SAFE WHEN I'M WITH YOU.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.611
Hanna: I STILL THINK WE SHOULD
DIP INTO THOSE CANDY-STRIPER
OUTFITS ONE MORE TIME.

00:55.650 --> 00:57.743
Emily: WHAT DIFFERENCE
WOULD THAT HAVE MADE?

00:57.790 --> 01:00.213
WELL, WE COULD'VE TALKED TO
JENNA INSTEAD OF GETTING TURNED
AWAY AT THE VISITOR'S DESK.

01:00.260 --> 01:02.751
GUYS! CAN YOU
KEEP IT DOWN, PLEASE?

01:02.790 --> 01:04.451
WHOLE POINT
WAS TO SNEAK BACK.

01:04.490 --> 01:07.618
I THINK MR. FACINELLI NOTICED
THAT OUR ENTIRE ROW WAS MISSING.

01:07.660 --> 01:08.627
WELL--

01:08.660 --> 01:09.866
I'D STILL LIKE TO GRADUATE.

01:09.900 --> 01:10.867
OH, NEWS FLASH--

01:10.900 --> 01:12.561
HONEY, NONE OF US
ARE GRADUATING.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.591
OKAY, I STILL THINK THAT
SPENCER TO GET BACK TO SHANA

01:14.640 --> 01:15.732
AND SEE IF SHE'LL SAY MORE.

01:15.770 --> 01:17.761
WHAT? WHY?
BECAUSE... !

01:17.810 --> 01:18.834
IF CECE DROWNED JENNA,

01:18.870 --> 01:20.406
THEN SHE MUST
KNOW THE REASON.

01:20.440 --> 01:22.340
AND WHY EXACTLY
DO WE TRUST SHANA?

01:22.380 --> 01:24.575
WHY DO WE TRUST JENNA?
Aria: ALL RIGHT,
WELL I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY,

01:24.610 --> 01:26.510
AND YOU GUYS ARE ABOUT AS QUIET
AS A MONSTER TRUCK RALLY.

01:26.550 --> 01:27.517
NOW SHUT UP.

01:27.550 --> 01:29.484
FINE.
I'M GOING TO THE SOURCE.

01:29.520 --> 01:30.509
"THE SOURCE"?

01:30.550 --> 01:32.211
( beeping )
CECE'S BEEN A.W.O.L.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.215
SINCE WILDEN WAS ALIVE.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.249
YOU'RE NOT JUST
GONNA FIND HER

01:34.290 --> 01:36.383
FOLDING PEASANT SKIRTS
AT THE DIVA DISH RIGHT NOW.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.751
WELL, THEN I'LL--I'LL
SEARCH EVERY HIPSTER BOUTIQUE

01:38.790 --> 01:39.757
UNTILI DO FIND HER.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.324
NO FRIGGIN' WAY.

01:41.360 --> 01:43.169
WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?
IS IT AN "A" TEXT?

01:43.200 --> 01:44.622
WORSE. IT'S MY MOTHER.

01:44.670 --> 01:47.332
MRS. DILAURENTIS HAS OFFERED
TO LET US STAY WITH HER.

01:47.370 --> 01:48.689
Aria: IN ALI'S HOUSE?

01:48.740 --> 01:50.605
YOU'RE GONNA SLEEP
IN ALI'S OLD BED?

01:50.640 --> 01:52.505
NO! HELL NO.
I'M NOT MOVING IN THERE.

01:53.510 --> 01:54.636
Hanna: YES, YOU ARE.

01:55.880 --> 01:57.643
EM, YOU HAVE TO.

01:57.680 --> 02:00.410
IT MIGHT BE OUR BEST CHANCE
TO FIND CECE.

02:01.550 --> 02:03.643
( school bell rings )

02:03.690 --> 02:05.681
( indistinct chattering )

02:08.520 --> 02:10.886
* GOT A SECRET,
CAN YOU KEEP IT? *

02:10.930 --> 02:13.524
* SWEAR THIS ONE
YOU'LL SAVE *

02:13.560 --> 02:16.199
* BETTER LOCK IT
IN YOUR POCKET *

02:16.230 --> 02:18.460
* TAKING THIS ONE
TO THE GRAVE *

02:18.500 --> 02:23.608
* IF I SHOW YOU THEN I'LL KNOW
YOU WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID *

02:23.640 --> 02:26.336
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN
KEEP A SECRET *

02:26.380 --> 02:28.473
* IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

02:31.510 --> 02:34.217
YOU COULD'VE BEEN
A LITTLE MORE SENSITIVE.
SHE'S HOMELESS RIGHT NOW,

02:34.250 --> 02:36.309
AND YOU JUST
CONVINCED HER TO STAY
IN OUR DEAD FRIENDS' ROOM.

02:36.350 --> 02:38.580
YEAH, WELL OUR FRIEND
IS CLOSE WITH CECE.

02:38.620 --> 02:40.656
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING THERE
THAT CAN HELP US TRACK HER DOWN.

02:40.690 --> 02:42.453
THAT ROOM IS FREAKY.

02:42.490 --> 02:44.253
ALI'S MOM TURNED IT
INTO A SHRINE.

02:44.290 --> 02:45.951
'KAY, YOU WANNA
TALK ABOUT "FREAKY"?

02:45.990 --> 02:47.548
LOOK AT THE GUY WHO HANGS OUT
AT THE ICE MACHINE

02:47.600 --> 02:48.692
AT EMILY'S MOTEL.

02:48.730 --> 02:50.322
HE CRUSHES ICE
WITH HIS ARMPIT.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.190
SHE SHOULD JUST ASK HER MOM

02:52.240 --> 02:53.798
IF SHE CAN COME STAY WITH US.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.661
I DON'T THINK MY MOM'S
TAKING ANY GUESTS
AT THE MOMENT.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.201
SHE'S HAVING A HARD ENOUGH TIME
GETTING DRESSED IN THE MORNING.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.502
WOULD A GUEST
BE A GOOD DISTRACT ION?

03:00.540 --> 03:01.871
AS MUCH AS SHE LOVES EMILY,

03:01.910 --> 03:04.174
I DON'T THINK SHE WANTS
TO CRY IN FRONT OF HER.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.448
YEAH.
LET'S TALK LATER, OKAY?

03:07.480 --> 03:08.549
OKAY.

03:08.580 --> 03:10.616
( doorknob rattling )

03:16.290 --> 03:18.656
HEY. DO YOU WANT ME
TO GIVE THAT A TRY?

03:18.690 --> 03:20.726
ACTUALLY PICKED A FEW LOCKS
IN MY TIME.

03:23.530 --> 03:24.963
NO. NO, THANKS.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.935
I-I'LL JUST GO BACK DOWN
TO THE JANITOR'S OFFICE.

03:27.970 --> 03:29.506
WAS HOPING TO AVOID THAT.

03:29.540 --> 03:31.667
SECOND TIME
I'VE DONE THIS TODAY.

03:32.780 --> 03:33.974
MR. FITZ?

03:34.010 --> 03:35.477
YEAH?

03:35.510 --> 03:36.602
HERE.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.472
THANK YOU.
YEAH.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.715
SO DOES THAT FORWARDING ADDRESS
BELONG TO CECE?

03:45.750 --> 03:46.853
I'M--I'M NOT SURE YET.

03:46.890 --> 03:48.448
HOW ARE YOU NOT SURE?

03:48.490 --> 03:49.980
IT'S A BOX AT THE POST OFFICE,
HANNA.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.328
SHE'S NOT GONNA JUMP OUT
LIKE A GIRL IN A BIRTHDAY CAKE

03:52.360 --> 03:53.327
AND YELL, "BOO."

03:53.360 --> 03:55.396
SO WHAT DID YOU FIND?

03:55.430 --> 03:57.819
( sighs )
I TRACKED DOWN
AN UNPAID CABLE BILL

03:57.870 --> 03:59.360
THAT WAS SENT TO THAT
P.O. BOX.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.560
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

04:00.600 --> 04:02.329
DO YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW?

04:02.370 --> 04:04.361
I MEAN, IT'S GONNA INVOLVE ME
TALKING ABOUT FIREWALLS

04:04.410 --> 04:06.378
AND CODE.
OKAY, NO. I DON'T.

04:06.410 --> 04:09.004
THAT CABLE BILL IS ATTACHED
TO A PHYSICAL ADDRESS IN PHILLY.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.747
WHERE CECE MAY OR MAY NOT
BE WATCHING SPORTSCENTER
RIGHT NOW?

04:11.780 --> 04:13.042
IT'S A LONG SHOT,

04:13.080 --> 04:14.616
BUT IT'S WORTH A TRY.

04:14.650 --> 04:15.639
( sighs )

04:18.490 --> 04:20.355
THESE ACTION SHOTS
ARE SICK.

04:20.390 --> 04:22.381
YOU MADE ME LOOK LIKE
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

04:23.890 --> 04:24.879
THIS ONE'S MY FAVORITE.

04:26.930 --> 04:28.750
( chuckles )
THANKS.

04:28.800 --> 04:29.789
THANK YOU.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.358
I WISH I COULD
USE ONE OF THESE

04:32.400 --> 04:33.765
FOR THE MATCH TONIGHT.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.392
THE PICTURE I GAVE 'EM
WAS SO OLD, I LOOK...

04:35.440 --> 04:38.034
( whispers )
like an altar boy.
( chuckles )

04:38.070 --> 04:39.833
WHAT--WHAT MATCH TONIGHT?

04:41.540 --> 04:42.575
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

04:42.610 --> 04:44.544
UM, IT'S A FIGHT

04:44.580 --> 04:45.899
THAT REQUIRES A HEADSHOT.

04:45.950 --> 04:47.645
IT SOUNDS LIKE A PRE'ITY BIG
DEAL TO ME.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.944
IT'S REGIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.446
WELL...

04:51.490 --> 04:53.014
IT MAKES IT SOUND
LIKE IT'S IMPRESSIVE,

04:53.060 --> 04:54.288
WHICH IT'S NOT.

04:54.320 --> 04:56.788
IT'S A BUNCH OF FOLD-OUT CHAIRS
AND A GYM THAT SMELLS LIKE FEET.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.923
NO, I LOVE IT.
CAN I COME?
( scoffs )

04:58.960 --> 05:00.655
IT'S TAKING A TRAIN
TO PHILLY

05:00.700 --> 05:02.520
TO WATCH GUYS MAKE ZOOLANDER
FACES AT EACH OTHER.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.367
YOU...YOU REALLY WANNA GO?

05:04.400 --> 05:06.391
WELL, ARE YOU
GONNA BE THERE?

05:06.440 --> 05:08.032
YEAH.

05:08.070 --> 05:10.436
THEN YES, I WANNA GO.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.834
MONA, WOULD YOU PLEASE
TELL ME

05:14.880 --> 05:17.747
YOUR EMOTIONAL RESPONSE
TO THIS PICTURE?

05:21.450 --> 05:23.384
IT'S A FAMILY ON A FARM.

05:23.420 --> 05:26.082
THE SUN IS SHINING
AND THEY'RE SMILING.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.418
IT'S A HAPPY PICTURE.

05:29.660 --> 05:31.958
SO, HOW DOES THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL?

05:34.130 --> 05:35.927
HAPPY.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.461
WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE?

05:38.930 --> 05:40.864
TELL YOUR ARTIST
TO TAKE A CLASS,

05:40.900 --> 05:43.368
BECAUSE THIS LOOKS LIKE
NORMAN ROCKWELL SKETCHED IT

05:43.410 --> 05:44.604
WITH HIS TEETH.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.801
THAT'S NOT A FEELING.
THAT'S AN OPINION.

05:46.840 --> 05:48.432
I'D LIKE TO KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.643
ABOUT FARM ANIMALS?
ABOUT WHAT YOU
SAY YOU'VE DONE.

05:53.480 --> 05:56.847
LOOK, THOSE GIRLS...
USED TO MAKE ME FEEL BAD.

05:57.850 --> 06:00.011
BUT RECENTLY,
I REALIZED THAT...

06:00.060 --> 06:02.756
WE'RE ON THE SAME SIDE.

06:02.790 --> 06:05.020
I WANTED TO MAKE UP
FOR ALL THE THINGS I'D DONE.

06:06.030 --> 06:07.622
WILDEN WAS BOTHERING THEM,

06:07.660 --> 06:09.594
SO I GOT RID OF HIM.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.723
AND I'D DO IT AGAIN.

06:11.770 --> 06:14.534
I DON'T THINK YOU
GOT RID OF ANYBODY.

06:14.570 --> 06:16.367
THAT'S MY RESPONSE.

06:19.510 --> 06:20.829
LET'S TAKE A BREAK.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.474
LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT
WHETHER YOU'RE GONNA
BE HONEST WITH ME.

06:23.510 --> 06:25.774
WHY WOULD I EVER
BE HONEST WITH YOU?

06:26.750 --> 06:27.739
USED TO BE.

06:27.780 --> 06:29.589
WELL THAT
WAS BEFORE I REALIZED

06:29.620 --> 06:31.417
WHERE YOUR LOYALTIES WERE.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.751
I'M NOT SURE
WHAT THAT MEANS.

06:34.790 --> 06:38.123
BUT I THOUGHT WE'D DONE
A GOOD JOB OF ESTABLISHING
A SENSE OF TRUST

06:38.160 --> 06:39.718
WHILE YOU'VE
BEEN A PATIENT HERE.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.666
THAT WAS BEFORE I REALIZED

06:42.700 --> 06:44.827
THAT YOU WERE KEEPING SECRETS
FROM ME.

06:46.470 --> 06:47.960
HMM.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.800
BY THE WAY, YOU FORGOT
THE "G" IN "DIAGNOSIS."

06:55.710 --> 06:57.109
( sighs )

06:59.620 --> 07:00.917
MONA...

07:00.950 --> 07:04.044
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S BEEN KEEPING A SECRET.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.809
AND YOU'RE SMART ENOUGH
TO KNOW I WAS GONNA
FIGURE IT OUT.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.612
FIGURE WHAT OUT?

07:08.660 --> 07:11.629
YOU STOPPED TAKING YOUR
MEDICATION.

07:13.660 --> 07:15.651
( footsteps )

07:19.000 --> 07:20.194
( lock engages )

07:20.240 --> 07:22.435
**

08:04.950 --> 08:06.679
I...

08:06.720 --> 08:09.541
I-I CAN'T STAY HERE.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.581
LOOK AT THIS.
IT'S LIKE A--

08:11.620 --> 08:12.985
A MUSEUM.

08:13.020 --> 08:14.556
AH--I KNOW I PROMISED HANNA,

08:14.590 --> 08:15.488
BUT I CAN'T DO THIS.

08:15.520 --> 08:18.956
OKAY, EMILY,
JUST TRY TO RELAX FOR A SECOND.

08:18.990 --> 08:20.719
LOOK,
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

08:20.760 --> 08:23.593
PUTTING BACK HER ROOM
IS REALLY NOT THAT STRANGE
OF A REACTION.

08:23.630 --> 08:25.120
( stammering )
I'M--I'M SERIOUS.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.961
THEIR PARENTS WOULD SOMETIMES
POSE THEM FOR LIFELIKE PHOTOS

08:30.010 --> 08:30.965
AS MEMENTOS.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.136
NOT HELPING.

08:32.170 --> 08:33.330
NOT HELPING AT ALL.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.837
OKAY, WELL JUST TRY TO REMEMBER
THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY.

08:35.880 --> 08:37.199
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD
FIND SOME STUFF IN HERE

08:37.250 --> 08:38.979
THAT COULD BE REALLY USEFUL
TO US.

08:39.010 --> 08:41.808
JUST NOT THRILLED BEING HERE
BY MYSELF.

08:41.850 --> 08:44.739
WAIT, YOUR MOM'S
NOT GONNA BE HERE WITH YOU?
NO. ( sighs )

08:44.790 --> 08:47.111
SHE HAS A HEARING
WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT
DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.583
SHE DOESN'T COME BACK
FROM HARRISBURG UNTIL TOMORROW.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.858
WHAT ABOUT PAIGE?

08:50.890 --> 08:52.118
CAN SHE COME OVER?

08:52.160 --> 08:54.025
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY
IN THE BEST PLACE RIGHT NOW.

08:54.060 --> 08:55.755
Mrs. DiLaurentis:
FOUND EVERYTHING YOU NEED?

08:55.800 --> 08:57.722
Spencer: UM...YEAH.

08:57.770 --> 08:59.635
I'M SORRY IT'S SO CHILLY.

08:59.670 --> 09:01.831
FURNACE IS ACTING UP.

09:01.870 --> 09:04.100
I'VE CALLED SOMEONE TO COME OVER
AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT.

09:04.140 --> 09:05.266
CAN I GET YOU GIRLS ANYTHING?

09:05.310 --> 09:08.700
I HAVE THOSE VANILLA WAFERS
THAT YOU ALL USED TO LIKE.

09:11.350 --> 09:13.238
UM...NO, THANKS.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.816
I SHOULD UNPACK.

09:14.850 --> 09:16.818
I'LL GET YOU
SOME HANGARS.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.622
( sighs )

09:29.260 --> 09:30.329
YOU KNOW, I--

09:30.370 --> 09:32.838
I DON'T REALLY WEAR THINGS
THAT NEED TO BE HUNG UP.

09:37.740 --> 09:40.277
THERE ARE FRESH TOWELS
IN THE LINEN CLOSET,

09:40.310 --> 09:41.675
AND...

09:41.710 --> 09:43.769
I MADE EXTRA KEYS.

09:43.810 --> 09:46.244
I REALLY WANT YOU
TO MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME
HERE, EMILY.

09:46.280 --> 09:49.010
I KNOW THAT YOU AND YOUR MOM
HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

09:49.050 --> 09:50.938
THANKS, MRS. D.

09:53.990 --> 09:57.289
IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU GIRLS
BACK IN THIS ROOM.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.252
IT'S LIKE YOU NEVER LEl-T.

10:03.230 --> 10:04.595
( sighs )

10:05.400 --> 10:06.628
( sighs )

10:09.740 --> 10:11.833
HEY.
HEY.

10:13.040 --> 10:15.907
OH, I THOUGHT YOU AND CARBS
WEREN'T FRIENDS ANYMORE.

10:15.940 --> 10:17.976
WE'RE NOT.
IT'S FOR MY MOM.

10:18.010 --> 10:20.171
SHE HASN'T REALLY
EATEN ANYTHING TODAY.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.711
WHERE IS SHE?

10:22.750 --> 10:24.945
SHUT UP IN HER ROOM.

10:24.990 --> 10:27.379
IF IT WASN'T
FOR THE PHONE CALLS
FROM MRS. HASTINGS,

10:27.420 --> 10:29.081
SHE PROBABLY WOULDN'T
EVEN GET OUT OF BED.

10:30.930 --> 10:33.899
WELL, THEN, DO YOU
WANNA GO CHECK OUT
THIS ADDRESS IN PHILLY?

10:33.930 --> 10:36.125
I MEAN, THERE'S A TRAIN
THAT LEAVES IN, LIKE, 40--

10:36.160 --> 10:38.219
ACTUALLY, UH,
ARIA'S GONNA DO THAT.

10:38.270 --> 10:40.932
SHE'S ALREADY GONNA
BE OUT THERE. SO...

10:42.870 --> 10:45.031
( clears throat )
UM, I WAS WONDERING IF...

10:46.170 --> 10:49.003
MAYBE YOU'D HELP ME
GET INTO RADLEY.

10:49.040 --> 10:51.042
WHY WOULD YOU WANNA DO THAT?

10:52.450 --> 10:54.418
THIS WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THE FACT

10:54.450 --> 10:56.247
THAT MONA HAS BEEN
MOVED THERE, WOULD IT?

10:56.280 --> 10:59.215
SHE'S THE ONLY PERSON
WHO CECE'S REACHED OUT TO.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.411
THEY'RE DOING A PSYCH EVALUATION
FOR A REASON, HANNA.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.678
MONA IS HELPING MY MOM.
SHE'S--

11:03.730 --> 11:06.824
NO, FIRST, "A" USED A SEDAN
AS A WRECKING BALL
ON EMILY'S HOUSE.

11:06.860 --> 11:08.896
AND THEN JENNA SHOWS UP

11:08.930 --> 11:10.761
IN A LAKE LOOKING LIKE
SOGGY BREAD,

11:10.800 --> 11:13.132
AND NOW YOU WANNA GO TO RADLEY
AND RING THE BELL JAR?

11:13.170 --> 11:14.728
SO YOU'RE
NOT COMING WITH ME?

11:14.770 --> 11:16.909
HANNA, LISTEN TO YOURSELF,
OKAY?

11:16.940 --> 11:18.999
YOU ARE SO DESPERATE
THAT YOU'RE WILLING

11:19.040 --> 11:20.268
TO GO TO THE ENEMY
FOR HELP.

11:20.310 --> 11:22.175
MONA IS NOT THE ENEMY
ANYMORE.

11:22.210 --> 11:23.973
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
FOR SURE.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.913
HANNA, I THINK IT'S TIME
THAT YOU WENT TO YOUR PARENTS

11:28.950 --> 11:30.349
AND THE COPS,
AND YOU TOLD THEM

11:30.390 --> 11:31.345
THAT "A" IS BACK.

11:31.390 --> 11:33.312
( scoffs )
NO.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.214
NO. THERE'S NO WAY
I'M DOING THAT!

11:35.260 --> 11:37.057
TELLING THEM WILL ONLY
MAKE IT WORSE.

11:37.090 --> 11:38.955
IT CAN'T GET ANY WORSE.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.298
GOD, JUST...

11:40.330 --> 11:43.265
GIVE ME SOME TIME
TO THINK THIS OVER.
( appliance beeping )

11:46.940 --> 11:48.828
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS
TO MY MOM.

11:53.310 --> 11:54.834
( sighs )

12:00.250 --> 12:02.275
**
( indistinct chattering )

12:04.850 --> 12:08.115
Man 1: ...LA'|'|'E.
Man 2: DID YOU WANT THAT
WITH WHOLE MILK?

12:08.160 --> 12:09.752
OKAY, GREAT.

12:09.790 --> 12:10.882
HEY!

12:11.930 --> 12:13.249
HI.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.927
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

12:14.960 --> 12:16.359
SORRY. STUPID QUESTION.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.766
I'M A LITTLE FUZZY.
I'VE BEEN WORKING 72 HOURS
STRAIGHT,

12:18.800 --> 12:19.767
AND THIS IS MY FIRST BREAK.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.495
YEAH. THE NURSE TOLD ME.

12:21.540 --> 12:24.134
OH, SO THIS ISN'T US
RUNNING INTO EACH OTHER

12:24.170 --> 12:26.502
SO MUCH AS...
I HUNTED YOU DOWN.

12:26.540 --> 12:29.236
WELL, THEN.
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

12:29.280 --> 12:31.407
IF YOU COULD JUST PLEASE

12:31.450 --> 12:32.815
LET ME IN TO SEE MONA--

12:32.850 --> 12:34.215
HANNA--
I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO SEE HER.

12:34.250 --> 12:35.740
I JUST WANNA TALK TO HER.
HANNA, YOU KNOW I CAN'T.

12:35.780 --> 12:38.419
IN FACT, GIVEN YOUR MOTHER'S
SITUATION, I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
BE TALKING TO YOU.

12:38.450 --> 12:39.485
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT MONA.

12:39.520 --> 12:41.488
I'M JUST WONDERING ABOUT CECE.

12:41.520 --> 12:42.828
CECE?

12:42.860 --> 12:44.885
HAS SHE CONTACTED YOU?

12:44.930 --> 12:46.124
OR--
WHY WOULD CECE CONTACT ME?

12:46.160 --> 12:48.856
SPENCER SAID THAT YOU LET HER
IN ONCE BEFORE TO SEE MONA,

12:48.900 --> 12:51.528
AND I WAS WONDERING
IF SHE THOUGHT THAT YOU
WOULD...DO IT AGAIN.

12:53.970 --> 12:55.130
WHAT'S WRONG?

12:55.170 --> 12:57.206
NO, NOTHING.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.936
IT'S JUST THE NURSE SAID SOMEONE
TRIED TO SEE MONA LAST NIGHT,

12:59.980 --> 13:02.403
AND WHEN SHE DESCRIBED
A YOUNG BLONDE, I THOUGHT IT
WAS PROBABLY YOU.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.305
IT WASN'T.

13:04.350 --> 13:05.374
DID SHE GET IN TO SEE HER?

13:05.410 --> 13:07.014
NO, SHE WAS TURNED AWAY.

13:07.050 --> 13:08.449
WELL THEN WHY ARE YOU
SO WORRIED?

13:08.480 --> 13:11.210
BETWEEN YOU AND ME,
EVER SINCE OUR BUDGET WAS CUT,

13:11.250 --> 13:12.979
THE HOSPITAL'S BEEN
A LITTLE SHORT-STAFFED.

13:13.020 --> 13:15.159
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
I'M SAYING THINGS
HAVE BEEN MISSED.

13:15.190 --> 13:18.023
THAT'S ALL.
OKAY, WELL YOU HAVE
SECURITY CAMERAS, RIGHT?

13:18.060 --> 13:19.186
I MEAN--UH...

13:19.230 --> 13:21.027
CAN'T YOU SEE IF IT
WAS HER, RIGHT?

13:21.060 --> 13:23.164
HANNA, I DON'T
WANT TO GET INVOLVED.
PLEASE.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.521
PLEASE DO THIS FOR ME.
IT'S IMPORTANT.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.567
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.204
THANK YOU.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.973
**

13:36.010 --> 13:37.477
( door opens )

13:39.110 --> 13:40.111
( door shuts )

13:40.150 --> 13:41.117
HI.

13:41.150 --> 13:42.447
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.819
YOU TAKE CARE
OF YOURS.

13:51.490 --> 13:54.618
"LEAVE THE LAMB ALONE
AND GO FOR THE LION."

13:54.660 --> 13:56.924
SO, "A" IS TELLING YOU

13:56.970 --> 13:58.562
TO DITCH EDDIE LAMB

13:58.600 --> 14:01.137
AND GO FOR DR. PALMER.

14:01.170 --> 14:03.536
BUT WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THE SHEET MUSIC?

14:03.570 --> 14:06.437
I RECOGNIZED IT
AS SOON AS I SAW IT.

14:06.470 --> 14:07.505
YOU DID?

14:09.040 --> 14:11.941
MY MOM USED TO PLAY THIS SONG
ALL THE TIME.

14:14.250 --> 14:16.115
I REMEMBER HER PLAYING IT.

14:17.950 --> 14:18.917
MAYBE...

14:18.950 --> 14:20.451
THERE'S SOME--

14:20.490 --> 14:24.085
THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT MY MOM'S CONNECTION
TO THE MUSIC

14:24.130 --> 14:26.086
THAT'S IMPORTANT.
YEAH.

14:26.130 --> 14:29.520
SOMETHING THAT SHE
SHARED IN HER SESSIONS
WITH DR. PALMER.

14:31.300 --> 14:33.939
WILL YOU COME WITH ME
TO SEE HIM?

14:33.970 --> 14:35.232
WHY?

14:35.270 --> 14:36.965
I MEAN, YOU DON'T--
YOU DON'T NEED ME.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.329
YOU'VE ALREADY MET HIM
ONCE BEFORE.

14:38.370 --> 14:39.974
BECAUSE YOU'RE
THE ONLY PERSON

14:40.010 --> 14:41.477
THAT I CAN TALK TO
ABOUT THIS.

14:41.510 --> 14:43.375
OKAY, WELL WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO TELL EMILY?

14:43.410 --> 14:45.173
'CAUSE I PROMISED HER THAT
I'D GO BACK TO THAT HOUSE--

14:45.210 --> 14:46.939
YOU CAN'T--
YOU CAN'T TELL HER ANYTHING.

14:46.980 --> 14:48.948
IF YOU DO,
THE FAUCET TURNS OFF,

14:48.980 --> 14:51.141
AND "A" ISN'T GOING
TO GIVE ME ANYTHING ELSE.

14:51.190 --> 14:53.010
AND WHEN DOES THIS END?

14:53.060 --> 14:55.119
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14:55.160 --> 14:57.685
I MEAN HOW MUCH LONGER DO YOU
NEED ME TO KEEP THIS A SECRET?

14:57.730 --> 15:00.221
UNTIL I FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPENED--

15:00.260 --> 15:02.558
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO HER.

15:06.300 --> 15:08.439
( clock chiming )

15:24.450 --> 15:26.953
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING,
DEAR?

15:26.990 --> 15:28.389
UM...

15:28.420 --> 15:29.409
YEAH, I--

15:29.460 --> 15:31.678
I WAS JUST GONNA GO
AND GET SOMETHING TO EAT.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.322
WELL LET ME MAKE YOU
SOMETHING.

15:33.360 --> 15:34.349
HAVE A SEAT.

15:36.130 --> 15:37.529
( sighing )

15:37.570 --> 15:39.367
JUST PASS THAT STUFF
OUT OF THE WAY.

15:39.400 --> 15:40.936
( sniffles )

15:42.740 --> 15:44.002
( sniffles )

15:44.040 --> 15:47.305
MY HUSBAND HAS DECIDED
TO DIVORCE ME.

15:48.780 --> 15:50.042
I'M FINE, REALLY.

15:50.080 --> 15:50.842
I'M JUST...

15:50.880 --> 15:52.677
DEALING WITH THE INITIAL
SHOCK OF IT.

15:57.450 --> 15:58.644
Ezra: OPEN IT.

16:03.490 --> 16:05.287
WHAT IS IT?
OPEN IT.

16:06.630 --> 16:08.689
DON'T BE AFRAID.
YOU ALREADY KNOW THE TRUTH.

16:08.730 --> 16:11.324
I'M THE ONE THAT'S...
LATE TO THE PARTY.

16:11.370 --> 16:13.338
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

16:13.370 --> 16:14.598
I SAW A LAWYER

16:14.640 --> 16:16.562
TO START THE PROCESS
OF GETTING MY NAME

16:16.600 --> 16:18.761
BUT ON MALCOLM'S
BIRTH CERTIFICATE.
EZRA, HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

16:18.810 --> 16:21.472
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO TAKE
MY SON AWAY FROM ME.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU

16:21.510 --> 16:24.047
WOULD GO BEHIND MY BACK.
OH, WHAT DO YOU CARE?

16:24.080 --> 16:26.344
THIS DOESN'T AMOUNT
TO MUCH MORE THAN SHADOW BOXING.

16:26.380 --> 16:28.041
DOES IT?

16:35.460 --> 16:37.018
( sighs )

16:43.800 --> 16:45.597
YOU KNEW I WASN'T HIS FATHER.

16:46.600 --> 16:47.669
( sighs )

16:51.410 --> 16:53.401
( phone beeping )

17:05.550 --> 17:06.539
CALEB?

17:09.490 --> 17:11.754
HEY.
HEY.

17:11.790 --> 17:14.520
UM, I THOUGHT YOU
WERE HELPING YOUR MOM
THE REST OF THE DAY.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.755
I AM.
I JUST WENT TO GO
DROP SOME PAPERS OFF

17:16.800 --> 17:18.165
AT SPENCER'S MOM'S OFFICE.

17:22.640 --> 17:25.666
CALEB, WHAT WERE YOU DOING
GOING INTO VERONICA'S
OFFICE BUILDING?

17:26.840 --> 17:28.671
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO PROTECT YOU ANYMORE.

17:28.710 --> 17:30.678
SO YOU WERE GONNA TELL HER?!

17:30.710 --> 17:33.315
YOU WERE ACTUALLY
GONNA TELL HER?!
YES, I WAS.

17:33.350 --> 17:35.215
OKAY, I WOULD RATHER
YOU HATE ME

17:35.250 --> 17:37.138
AND BE SAFE
THAN THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

17:37.190 --> 17:39.545
AND YOU THINK TELLING HER
ABOUT "A" IS GONNA KEEP ME SAFE?

17:39.590 --> 17:42.252
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
SHE CAN DO A LOT MORE
FOR YOU THAN I CAN.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.350
YOU KNOW, IF SOME PUNK
COMES UP TO YOU IN THE STREET,

17:45.390 --> 17:47.426
I'M GONNA DO WHATEVER I CAN
TO LAY HIM OUT.

17:47.460 --> 17:48.552
BUT THIS ENEMY--

17:48.600 --> 17:50.568
THIS ENEMY IS EVERYWHERE

17:50.600 --> 17:53.091
AND--AND NOWHERE
AT THE SAME TIME.

17:55.670 --> 17:57.206
I KEEP--

17:57.240 --> 17:58.229
( sighs )

17:58.270 --> 17:59.828
I KEEP TAKING SWINGS
IN THE DARK,

17:59.870 --> 18:01.178
AND I'M MISSING.

18:02.640 --> 18:05.871
I'M JUST--I'M NOT ENOUGH
TO KEEP YOU SAFE ANYMORE.

18:05.910 --> 18:07.844
YES, YOU ARE.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.468
JUST TELL HIM TO PUSH BACK
THE MEETING A HALF-HOUR.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.502
I HAD TO PICK UP
FILES FROM HOME.

18:30.540 --> 18:31.700
THANKS, ANYA.

18:31.740 --> 18:33.230
BYE.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.872
( phone beeps )
( sighs )

18:35.840 --> 18:37.239
NOW WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

18:38.550 --> 18:41.610
LOOK, I KNOW MY HISTORY
WITH THE HASTINGS HAS BEEN
A BIT...ROCKY.

18:41.650 --> 18:43.345
I'M NOT GOING
TO DEBATE THAT.

18:43.390 --> 18:44.743
BUT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
YOU LIKE ME--

18:44.790 --> 18:46.439
LIKE YOU?

18:46.490 --> 18:48.219
YOU BROKE MY DAUGHTER'S HEART

18:48.260 --> 18:50.854
AND TOOK EVERY PIECE OF GOODWILL
THIS FAMILY EXTENDED TO YOU

18:50.890 --> 18:52.482
AND FLUSHED IT DOWN THE TOILET.

18:54.360 --> 18:56.851
WHY ARE YOU HERE, WREN?

18:56.900 --> 18:58.925
I'M HERE TO WARN YOU...

18:58.970 --> 19:00.631
ABOUT MONA.

19:00.670 --> 19:02.831
I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE'S
CONFESSED TO THIS MURDER,

19:02.870 --> 19:04.758
BUT... YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.562
LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING
TO YOU.

19:06.610 --> 19:09.170
I'M A DEFENSE ATTORNEY.
I DON'T CARE WHY
MONA'S CONFESSED.

19:09.210 --> 19:10.905
WHETHER SHE DID IT OR NOT,
SHE'S HELPED MY CASE

19:10.950 --> 19:13.248
BY GIVING ME AN ALTERNATE
EXPLANATION FOR THE CRIME.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.645
50--
AND SHE MAY HAVE DONE.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.409
BUT SHE'S GOING
TO TURN THE TABLES ON YOU.

19:17.890 --> 19:20.279
SHE'S A DANGEROUS PERSON.

19:20.320 --> 19:22.379
AND SHE HASN'T FORGIVEN YOUR
DAUGHTER OR HER FRIENDS,

19:22.420 --> 19:24.388
DESPITE WHAT SHE SAYS.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.318
SHE WANTS TO SEE THEM HURT,

19:26.360 --> 19:28.749
AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE
CLOSEST TO THEM...

19:28.800 --> 19:30.153
LIKE ASHLEY MARIN.

19:30.200 --> 19:33.237
YOU KNOW YOU COULD
LOSE YOUR MEDICAL LICENSE
FOR TELLING ME THIS?

19:34.400 --> 19:36.197
SHE'S STILL YOUR PATIENT,
ISN'T SHE?

19:36.240 --> 19:37.901
SHE IS.

19:37.940 --> 19:40.158
BUT IF I HADN'T
MADE SUCH A MESS OF THINGS...

19:40.980 --> 19:43.744
YOU WERE ONCE
GOING TO BE MY FAMILY.

19:48.650 --> 19:50.345
WE'D BEEN FIGHTING A LOT...

19:50.390 --> 19:51.709
OVER DUMB STUFF.

19:51.750 --> 19:54.412
AND YOU WERE GONNA
BE LEAVING FOR SCHOOL
AT THE END OF SUMMER--

19:54.460 --> 19:56.678
SO--WHAT?
IT'S MY FAULT?

19:56.720 --> 19:58.529
NO.

19:59.560 --> 20:01.221
I WAS MAD AT YOU.

20:02.730 --> 20:05.369
I WENT TO A PARTY
WITH SOME FRIENDS,

20:05.400 --> 20:07.595
HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK--

20:10.510 --> 20:12.705
I MADE A MISTAKE.

20:12.740 --> 20:14.970
SO WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO SAY?

20:15.010 --> 20:17.444
THAT YOU...DIDN'T KNOW?

20:18.510 --> 20:20.239
YOU MAY HAVE BEEN
CONFUSED THEN,

20:20.280 --> 20:22.475
BUT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN CONFUSED
FOR SEVEN YEARS, MAGGIE.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.442
I KNEW IT WAS A QUESTION.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.344
BUT I DECIDED
TO ANSWER IT MYSELF,

20:26.390 --> 20:27.982
AND I GAVE MYSELF

20:28.020 --> 20:30.887
THE ANSWER THAT I WANTED.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.319
NO, I-I CAN'T FEEL BAD
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

20:33.360 --> 20:34.327
I WON'T.

20:34.360 --> 20:35.657
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO.

20:35.700 --> 20:37.793
YOU LET ME BELIEVE
HE WAS MY CHILD.

20:37.830 --> 20:39.821
I'VE TAKEN HIM TO THE MOVIES,

20:39.870 --> 20:42.338
TO BASEBALL GAMES.

20:42.370 --> 20:44.907
I'VE HELPED HIM
WITH HIS HOMEWORK.

20:44.940 --> 20:46.999
WE--

20:47.040 --> 20:49.338
WE HAVE INSIDE JOKES.

20:50.380 --> 20:51.904
I KNOW THAT HE--

20:51.950 --> 20:54.612
HE HATES TOO MUCH MILK
IN HIS CEREAL.

20:54.650 --> 20:55.742
UM...

20:57.890 --> 21:00.984
AND I KNOW THE NAMES
OF EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF HIS STUFFED ANIMALS.

21:02.060 --> 21:04.028
AND I KNOW EXACTLY
WHICH ONE HE NEEDS

21:04.060 --> 21:06.528
WHEN HE WAKES UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.662
YOU MADE ME
BELIEVE HE'S MY--

21:12.700 --> 21:14.292
HE'S MY CHILD.

21:14.340 --> 21:15.329
( sighs )

21:16.800 --> 21:18.506
I'M SORRY.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.300
YOU LET ME FALL IN LOVE
WITH HIM.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.440
( sighs )

21:30.490 --> 21:32.515
I'M SORRY.
( sighs )

21:35.120 --> 21:36.781
I-I REALLY AM.

21:38.490 --> 21:40.924
( door opens, shuts )

21:40.960 --> 21:41.949
( sighs )

21:43.530 --> 21:45.020
OKAY, WELL,
IF I DON'T GET BACK SOON,

21:45.070 --> 21:46.526
HE'S GONNA THINK THAT
IT'S WEIRD.

21:46.570 --> 21:47.867
I MEAN, GONE WITH THE WIND
TOOK LESS TIME

21:47.900 --> 21:48.730
THAN THIS FRO-YO RUN.

21:48.770 --> 21:50.931
TRUST ME,
JAKE WILL STILL BE KICKING

21:50.970 --> 21:52.858
WHEN YOU GET BACK.
Aria: FINE.

21:52.910 --> 21:54.571
OH, BUT CAN YOU PLEASE
CHECK IN ON EMILY

21:54.610 --> 21:55.770
AND SEE HOW SHE'S DOING?

21:55.810 --> 21:58.074
SPENCER SAID SHE
WAS PRETTY CREEPED-OUT
WHEN SHE LEI-T.

21:58.110 --> 22:00.578
YEAH. SURE.
THANKS.
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

22:04.790 --> 22:06.417
OH! EXCUSE ME.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.054
SORRY.
YOU FROM THE MANAGEMENT
COMPANY?

22:08.090 --> 22:11.059
I'M HERE TO--
BECAUSE I TOLD THE LADY
ON THE PHONE

22:11.090 --> 22:12.682
I'LL MOVE OUT,
BUT AS FAR AS--

22:12.730 --> 22:15.551
NO, NO--I'M HERE
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
NAMED CECE DRAKE.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.068
WELL IF YOU FIND HER,
LET ME KNOW.

22:21.400 --> 22:23.630
WE GRIEVED DIFFERENTLY.

22:23.670 --> 22:26.036
KEN BOXED UP
ALL OF ALI'S THINGS

22:26.070 --> 22:28.675
AND PUT THE HOUSE
ON THE MARKET, AND I....

22:28.710 --> 22:31.838
FELT HER PRESENCE
EVERYWHERE.

22:31.880 --> 22:34.576
I EVEN STARTED SEEING HER.

22:34.620 --> 22:36.417
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

22:36.450 --> 22:40.409
I WAS JOGGING IN THE PARK
AND I SAW THIS YOUNG WOMAN
AHEAD OF ME.

22:40.460 --> 22:41.984
IT WAS ALI.

22:42.020 --> 22:43.749
I COULD'VE SWORN.

22:43.790 --> 22:46.350
THE HAIR, THE WALK--
IT WAS HER.

22:47.160 --> 22:48.923
I STARTED RUNNING Al-TER HER.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.167
I PRACTICALLY TACKLED
THAT POOR GIRL.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.566
SO IT WASN'T ALI?

22:53.600 --> 22:56.398
I LOSE A PIECE OF HER
EVERY DAY.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.761
THAT'S WHY I DID THE ROOM.

22:58.810 --> 23:01.608
IF IT WERE UP TO KEN,
HE'D JUST LOCK
THAT BEDROOM DOOR

23:01.640 --> 23:02.436
AND TH ROW AWAY THE KEY.

23:04.080 --> 23:06.105
YOU THINK YOU KNOW SOMEBODY
SO WELL,

23:06.150 --> 23:07.708
BUT THEN...

23:07.750 --> 23:10.116
SOMETHING THAT YOU
BOTH COUNTED ON CHANGES,

23:10.150 --> 23:11.117
AND...

23:11.150 --> 23:13.459
YOU FIND OUT
WHO THEY REALLY ARE.

23:13.490 --> 23:16.755
JUST WISH IT HADN'T TAKEN ME
24 YEARS TO LEARN THAT.

23:17.860 --> 23:19.782
I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND.

23:19.830 --> 23:21.695
NO, I DO.

23:21.730 --> 23:24.028
I'M GOING THROUGH IT,
MYSELF.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.129
SOMEONE I'M DATING.

23:26.170 --> 23:28.866
WE'RE BECOMING DIFFERENT
PEOPLE, BUT...

23:28.900 --> 23:31.164
KEEP TRYING TO IGNORE THAT.

23:31.210 --> 23:33.508
WELL WHAT DOES HE THINK?

23:33.540 --> 23:34.939
UM...

23:36.140 --> 23:38.142
ACTUALLY, I--

23:38.180 --> 23:40.944
I-I WASN'T SURE IF YOU KNEW,
BUT I GUESS NOT.

23:42.620 --> 23:43.917
I'M WITH A GIRL.

23:44.950 --> 23:46.986
I REALIZED THAT'S
WHO I WANT TO BE WITH,

23:47.020 --> 23:49.011
AND THAT'S WHO I AM.

23:50.020 --> 23:51.180
( sighs )

23:51.230 --> 23:53.824
I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU,
EMILY.

23:56.630 --> 23:59.190
MRS. DILAURENTIS,

23:59.230 --> 24:00.788
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

24:00.840 --> 24:03.195
THAT YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S SEEN ALI.

24:04.710 --> 24:06.109
I HAVE, TOO.

24:06.140 --> 24:08.529
OF COURSE YOU HAVE.

24:13.250 --> 24:15.673
I WISH THAT ALI COULD'VE
RETURNED THOSE FEELINGS.

24:15.720 --> 24:19.679
I COULDN'T HAVE ASKED
FOR A BETTER PERSON
TO LOVE HER THAN YOU.

24:23.760 --> 24:25.819
WHEN CECE DROPPED OUT
OF UPENN AND LEl-T FOR L.A.,

24:25.860 --> 24:27.691
SHE WAS STILL PAYING RENT.

24:27.730 --> 24:29.493
AT LEAST,
I THOUGHT SHE WAS.

24:29.530 --> 24:30.827
SHE DROPPED OUT,
OR...

24:30.870 --> 24:32.121
SHE WAS KICKED OUT?

24:33.600 --> 24:34.760
HOW'D YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

24:34.800 --> 24:37.735
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T
REALLY "GIRLS" WITH CECE.

24:37.770 --> 24:39.101
UH, I WASN'T,

24:39.140 --> 24:40.676
BUT MY FRIEND ALISON WAS.

24:40.710 --> 24:42.701
SO YOU'RE ONE
OF ALISON'S FRIENDS?

24:42.740 --> 24:43.707
( car horn honking )

24:43.750 --> 24:44.808
YOU WANT THE SPOT?!

24:44.850 --> 24:45.999
MOVE A BOX!

24:47.310 --> 24:49.278
WELL, THEN YOU KNOW.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.981
I'M SORRY--KNOW WHAT?

24:51.020 --> 24:52.578
ALISON GOT HER KICKED OUT.

24:52.620 --> 24:55.214
AT LEAST,
THAT'S WHAT CECE CLAIMED.

24:55.260 --> 24:57.728
UH, SHE COULD'VE BEEN LYING.

24:57.760 --> 25:00.149
TRUE, BUT HAVING MET ALISON,

25:00.190 --> 25:03.125
I COULD SEE THAT CHICK
SHOVING SOMEONE
DOWN THE STAIRS.

25:03.160 --> 25:04.593
WHAT?

25:04.630 --> 25:06.166
YOU WERE AT THAT FRAT PARTY.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.599
W-WHICH ONE ARE YOU?

25:07.640 --> 25:09.596
IN ALISON'S CREW?

25:09.640 --> 25:12.859
CECE ALWAYS SAID THERE
WERE FOUR OTHER SHE-DEVILS.

25:12.910 --> 25:14.070
"SHE-DEVILS"?

25:15.310 --> 25:18.575
WELL I-I HARDLY
EVEN KNEW CECE, AND THAT...

25:18.610 --> 25:20.009
PARTY WAS LIKE
TH REE YEARS AGO.

25:20.050 --> 25:21.677
I BARELY EVEN REMEMBER
ANYTHING.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.881
WELL, IT STAYED PRETTY FRESH
IN CECE'S MIND.

25:23.920 --> 25:26.582
SHE ASSUMED YOU
WERE ALL IN ON IT.

25:26.620 --> 25:27.917
AND SHE HATED YOU FOR IT.

25:33.160 --> 25:34.821
( knocking on door)
Hanna: HELLO?

25:34.860 --> 25:36.691
MRS. DILAURENTIS?

25:36.730 --> 25:37.719
( door shuts )

25:40.030 --> 25:41.861
HELLO?

25:44.910 --> 25:46.263
EM?

25:48.210 --> 25:49.677
( sighs )

25:51.110 --> 25:52.873
MRS. DILAURENTIS?

25:54.220 --> 25:55.676
( creaking )

26:01.790 --> 26:02.779
( door shuts )

26:03.790 --> 26:04.779
( sighs )

26:15.640 --> 26:17.198
( door opens )

26:24.380 --> 26:26.177
( creaking )

26:28.280 --> 26:29.872
EMILY?

26:57.310 --> 27:00.279
( music box plays )

27:08.160 --> 27:09.354
( sighs )

27:33.150 --> 27:35.277
Woman on TV:
HE'S A STRAIGHT SHOOTER.
HE TELLS IT LIKE IT IS.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.379
Man on TV:
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW--
YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID--

27:37.420 --> 27:40.014
HE ASKED ME
TO PUT A CHICKEN IN,
AND HE WANTED CHICKEN.

27:40.050 --> 27:43.417
HE SAID SOMETHING LIKE,
"THIS IS THE BEST PIECE
OF CHICKEN YOU'LL EVER--

27:43.460 --> 27:44.427
DR. PALMER?

27:44.460 --> 27:45.427
WHY, YES.

27:45.460 --> 27:47.189
HELLO.

27:47.230 --> 27:49.323
UM, THIS IS SPENCER.
HI.

27:50.330 --> 27:51.763
IT'S A PLEASURE.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.360
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU REMEMBER ME--

27:54.400 --> 27:56.891
I'M MARION CAVANAUGH'S SON.

27:56.940 --> 27:58.430
THAT'S RIGHT.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.032
MMM...

28:01.080 --> 28:03.901
I-I CAME TO VISIT YOU
NOT THAT LONG AGO,

28:03.950 --> 28:05.406
AND WE TALKED ABOUT MY MOTHER.

28:05.450 --> 28:08.772
I WAS, UH, HOPING THAT WE
COULD TALK ABOUT HER SOME MORE.

28:08.820 --> 28:11.948
I'D BE HAPPY TO TALK WITH YOU
ABOUT HER.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.086
UM--

28:16.220 --> 28:18.188
CAN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS?

28:18.230 --> 28:19.822
( clears throat )

28:22.760 --> 28:23.897
( mutters indistinctly)

28:23.930 --> 28:25.363
( chuckles )

28:25.400 --> 28:27.095
AH, THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

28:30.940 --> 28:34.068
OH, UNFORTUNATELY, UM...

28:34.110 --> 28:36.305
I DON'T PLAY.

28:42.480 --> 28:45.119
( buzzer sounds )
( door opens )

28:48.190 --> 28:49.851
( door shuts )

28:49.890 --> 28:51.380
HELLO, MRS. HASTINGS.

28:52.390 --> 28:53.527
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

28:53.560 --> 28:56.120
ISN'T THERE SOMEONE
AT THE FRONT DESK?
YES, THERE IS.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.263
OH.

28:59.300 --> 29:01.939
OH, I GUESS YOU MUST'VE
MADE FRIENDS WITH THE NURSES

29:01.970 --> 29:03.289
WHEN YOUR DAUGHTER
WAS HERE.

29:03.340 --> 29:05.205
( inhales deeply )

29:05.240 --> 29:07.435
I WANTED TO HAVE
A LITTLE CHAT WITH YOU,

29:07.470 --> 29:08.471
OFF THE RECORD.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.268
MAY I?

29:14.020 --> 29:16.773
( sighs,
clears throat )

29:16.820 --> 29:18.981
( phone rings )

29:19.020 --> 29:20.180
( sighs )

29:20.220 --> 29:22.017
( phone continues
ringing )

29:23.320 --> 29:25.322
( line ringing )

29:28.430 --> 29:30.227
( ringing continues )
HEY, ARIA.

29:30.260 --> 29:33.127
I'M, UH...UP IN FIVE.
( ringing continues )

29:33.170 --> 29:34.933
AWESOME!
I'LL--I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

29:34.970 --> 29:36.392
I JUST--
I NEED TO TAKE THIS.

29:36.440 --> 29:38.067
( ringing continues )

29:39.540 --> 29:41.428
( line ringing )

29:44.180 --> 29:45.943
( phone beeps )

29:47.250 --> 29:48.877
( sighs )

29:51.990 --> 29:52.979
( phone beeps )

29:54.390 --> 29:56.881
WHY ARE YOU THROWING YOURSELF
ON THE SWORD?

29:58.590 --> 30:01.423
I GET THE FEELING THAT YOU
MAKE A LOT OF PEOPLE NERVOUS.

30:01.460 --> 30:02.859
AM I RIGHT?

30:03.930 --> 30:06.125
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT?
SO DO I.

30:06.170 --> 30:07.899
I CAN BE PRETTY SCARY,
MYSELF.

30:07.940 --> 30:09.999
( sighs )
AND IF I FIND OUT

30:10.040 --> 30:13.032
THAT YOU'RE GOING
TO USE THIS STUNT AGAINST
MY DAUGHTER AND HER FRIENDS,

30:13.070 --> 30:15.402
YOU'LL FIND OUT
JUST HOW SCARY.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.874
THE ONLY PERSON WHO
MESSED WITH YOUR DAUGHTER

30:17.910 --> 30:19.946
AND HER FRIENDS
WAS WILDEN.

30:19.980 --> 30:21.948
AND HE'S DEAD NOW.

30:23.550 --> 30:26.246
OKAY.
HAVE IT YOUR WAY, MONA.

30:27.350 --> 30:29.511
BUT IF YOU CONTINUE
TO SCREW WITH MY FAMILY

30:29.560 --> 30:31.084
OR THIS CASE,

30:31.130 --> 30:33.587
I HAVE WAYS TO SEE TO IT
THAT YOU ROT IN A CELL

30:33.630 --> 30:35.495
UNTIL YOUR HAIR TURNS GRAY.

30:35.530 --> 30:37.350
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

30:44.040 --> 30:45.029
( lock engages )

30:48.240 --> 30:51.107
DO YOU REMEMBER MY MOTHER
TALKING ABOUT MUSIC?

30:51.150 --> 30:54.870
( Palmer stammering )
I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TALK
WITH YOU ABOUT MUSIC.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.569
YOU KNOW, I ADORE OPERA
IN PARTICULAR.

30:56.620 --> 30:58.315
UH, SIR,
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT--

30:58.350 --> 31:00.841
( _"Any Time"
playIng on piano )

31:03.220 --> 31:05.222
( playing continues )

31:12.670 --> 31:14.490
OH, MARION.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.633
THAT'S LOVELY.

31:16.670 --> 31:18.865
IS TOBY COMING TODAY?

31:21.010 --> 31:23.945
( continues playing )

31:29.550 --> 31:31.586
NO.

31:31.620 --> 31:33.645
NO, DR. PALMER, HE'S NOT.

31:35.460 --> 31:37.655
WELL I-I-I THINK IT
WOULD MEAN A LOT TO HIM

31:37.690 --> 31:39.328
TO HEAR YOU PLAY.

31:39.360 --> 31:42.227
( playing continues )
Spencer:
HE'S--HE'S HEARD ME BEFORE.

31:42.260 --> 31:44.262
YES, BUT NOT
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN HERE.

31:44.300 --> 31:46.666
I THINK IT WOULD GIVE HIM

31:46.700 --> 31:48.258
A GREAT DEAL OF COMFORT

31:48.300 --> 31:51.201
TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE ENJOYING
YOUR MUSIC ONCE AGAIN.

31:52.270 --> 31:55.569
DON'T YOU THINK
HE NEED TO SEE THAT?

32:01.280 --> 32:02.611
UM, DR. PALMER,

32:02.650 --> 32:05.346
COULD YOU TELL ME AGAIN
ABOUT THE BLONDE GIRL?

32:05.390 --> 32:07.312
THE ONE THAT I SHOULD
STEER CLEAR OF?

32:08.320 --> 32:09.514
WHAT BLON DE?

32:09.560 --> 32:13.155
Y-YOU TALKED TO ME ABOUT HER.
YOU SAID THAT SHE WAS DANGEROUS.

32:13.190 --> 32:14.452
YES.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.058
THAT'S RIGHT.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.261
OH, LOOKS LIKE
OUR TIME IS UP.

32:20.300 --> 32:22.291
( clears throat )

32:22.340 --> 32:23.432
I WILL SEE YOU NEXT SESSION.

32:23.470 --> 32:26.303
W-WAS IT CECE DRAKE?

32:26.340 --> 32:28.376
DR. PALMER,
WAS HER NAME CECE DRAKE?

32:28.410 --> 32:31.470
CAN YOU PLEASE SHOW
MRS. DILAURENTIS TO MY OFFICE?

32:43.590 --> 32:44.727
HE SAID, "DILAURENTIS."

32:44.760 --> 32:45.749
I'M POSITIVE.

32:45.790 --> 32:46.722
HOW CAN YOU BE POSITIVE?

32:46.760 --> 32:49.092
YOU SAID IT WAS TOBY
THAT WAS THERE, NOT YOU.

32:49.130 --> 32:50.757
NO--IT WAS.

32:50.800 --> 32:53.564
'KAY--WHAT WAS TOBY
DOING IN AN OLD FOLKS' HOME?

32:53.600 --> 32:55.136
I-I DON'T KNOW, OKAY.

32:55.170 --> 32:56.637
IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH NIGEL'S PHONE.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.433
YOU GUYS ARE FOCUSING
ON THE WRONG DETAILS, OKAY?

32:58.470 --> 33:01.030
SHE WAS THERE.
ALI'S MOM WAS AT RADLEY
AT SOME POINT.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.502
HE HAS DEMENTIA.

33:02.540 --> 33:04.246
THE NAME "DILAURENTIS"
HAS BEEN EVERYWHERE.

33:04.280 --> 33:05.702
MAYBE HE JUST GOT IT
STUCK IN HIS HEAD.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.604
WELL, I THINK IT'S
WORTH IT TO FIND OUT.

33:07.650 --> 33:08.617
SO WHAT?

33:08.650 --> 33:10.174
YOU'RE JUST
GONNA ASK HER?

33:10.220 --> 33:11.539
YEAH, WHY NOT?

33:13.050 --> 33:15.211
UM, BECAUSE SHE'S
GOING THROUGH A DIVORCE,

33:15.260 --> 33:17.012
AND SHE'S A LITTLE FRAGILE.

33:17.060 --> 33:18.186
( Emily scoffs )

33:18.230 --> 33:20.050
I CAN'T TALK
ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

33:21.060 --> 33:22.425
I'M LATE FOR WORK.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.592
( door shuts )
( sighs )

33:31.410 --> 33:33.401
Mrs. DiLaurentis:
EMILY, IS THAT YOU?

33:33.440 --> 33:36.102
UH, ACTUALLY,
EMILY LEI-T FOR WORK.

33:36.140 --> 33:39.246
OH, AND I WAS HOPING YOU GIRLS
WOULD STAY FOR DINNER.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.111
YOU COULD EVEN SLEEP OVER
IF YOU LIKE.

33:41.150 --> 33:42.777
I STILL HAVE THE TRUNDLE BED
UPSTAIRS.

33:42.820 --> 33:45.243
I SHOULD...
PROBABLY GET HOME.

33:45.290 --> 33:47.781
YOU KNOW, IT'S CHILLY IN HERE
RIGHT NOW, BUT THE FURNACE GUY
IS ON HIS WAY.

33:47.820 --> 33:49.811
NO, IT'S--
UM, ANOTHER TIME.

33:49.860 --> 33:50.815
YEAH.

33:50.860 --> 33:52.088
Spencer: UM...

33:53.460 --> 33:54.654
MRS. DILAURENTIS,

33:54.700 --> 33:58.067
DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW
A DR. PALMER?

33:58.100 --> 33:59.522
THE NAME RINGS A BELL.

33:59.570 --> 34:00.662
WHAT KIND OF DOCTOR IS HE?

34:00.700 --> 34:02.395
A PSYCHIATRIST

34:02.440 --> 34:03.793
FROM RADLEY.

34:03.840 --> 34:05.501
THIS IS YOUR DOCTOR?

34:05.540 --> 34:06.734
UH, NO, NO.

34:06.770 --> 34:08.579
UH, HE'S RETIRED.

34:08.610 --> 34:11.545
I WAS JUST WONDERING--

34:11.580 --> 34:13.502
I WAS WONDERING
IF HE WAS YOURS.

34:13.550 --> 34:15.415
WHY WOULD YOU
WONDER THAT, DEAR?

34:15.450 --> 34:16.815
BECAUSE HE MENTIONED YOU.

34:16.850 --> 34:18.579
OH.

34:18.620 --> 34:20.747
WELL, IF IT'S THE GUY
I'M THINKING OF,

34:20.790 --> 34:22.155
I ONLY MET HIM THE ONE TIME.

34:22.190 --> 34:24.681
BUT HE WASN'T
MY PSYCHIATRIST.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.083
WAS HE ALI'S?

34:26.890 --> 34:28.824
NO, HE WASN'T.

34:30.460 --> 34:32.462
( piano playing )

34:35.640 --> 34:37.699
Mrs. DiLaurentis:
( sternly)
WHERE ARE YOU?

34:37.740 --> 34:38.764
I'M IN HERE.

34:38.810 --> 34:40.209
DUH.

34:42.480 --> 34:45.472
AREN'T YOU IMPRESSED?
I GUESS ALL YOUR NAGGING
FINALLY PAID OFF.

34:45.510 --> 34:46.875
(gasping )
OH, MY GOD!

34:46.910 --> 34:48.878
YOU ALMOST TOOK OFF
MY FRICKIN' FINGERS!

34:48.920 --> 34:51.115
YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY?
THE STUNT YOU PULLED?

34:51.150 --> 34:52.617
THAT SOME SORT
OF SICK JOKE TO YOU?

34:52.650 --> 34:54.618
YOU SERIOUSLY ALMOST
TOOK OFF MY LIMBS.

34:54.660 --> 34:56.719
IS THAT WHAT THE TWO OF YOU
DO WHEN YOU'RE NOT BRAIDING
EACH OTHER'S HAIR?

34:56.760 --> 34:58.489
FIGURE OUT WAYS TO SCARE
THE HELL OUT OF ME?

34:58.530 --> 35:00.452
WHY ARE YOU HAVING
A FULL-ON HEMORRHAGE?

35:00.490 --> 35:03.425
DON'T YOU SPEAK TO ME THAT WAY.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!

35:03.460 --> 35:05.621
I GET A PHONE CALL
THIS AFTERNOON--
"WE HAVE YOUR DAUGHTER HERE,"

35:05.670 --> 35:08.594
THEY TELL ME.
"WE THINK SHE MAY BE
A DANGER TO HERSELF.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.164
SHE WANTS TO STAY HERE."

35:10.200 --> 35:12.202
SO I RUN ABOUT THREE
STOP SIGNS.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.662
I'M TRYING TO GET YOUR FATHER
ON THE PHONE.

35:13.710 --> 35:16.270
I'M--I'M TERRIFIED
THAT YOU'VE HURT YOURSELF.

35:16.310 --> 35:19.347
THEN I GET THERE--
SHE'S DRESSED HEAD-TO-TOE
IN YOUR CLOTHING,

35:19.380 --> 35:21.245
BUT IT'S NOT MY DAUGHTER
SITTING IN RADLEY.

35:21.280 --> 35:23.248
IT'S CECE DRAKE.

35:24.850 --> 35:27.614
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
CRAZY BITCH ACTUALLY DID IT.

35:27.650 --> 35:28.856
GO TO YOUR ROOM.

35:28.890 --> 35:30.551
GO TO YOUR ROOM,

35:30.590 --> 35:32.751
BECAUSE I CAN'T BE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT HAPPENS.

35:32.790 --> 35:34.690
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT
SHE WAS ACTUALLY GONNA DO IT.

35:34.730 --> 35:37.756
WELL, YOU ENJOY IT,

35:37.800 --> 35:39.859
BECAUSE IT'S THE LAST GAME
THAT THE TWO OF YOU

35:39.900 --> 35:41.891
ARE GOING TO PLAY TOGETHER.

35:41.940 --> 35:44.306
EVEN THE DOCTOR I SPOKE TO
AGREED THAT THIS FRIENDSHIP

35:44.340 --> 35:45.466
IS TOXIC.

35:46.470 --> 35:49.200
SO ARE A LOT OF THINGS.

35:49.240 --> 35:51.674
THAT GIRL IS NO LONGER
WELCOME IN THIS HOUSE.

36:06.630 --> 36:08.689
HAD THEY EVER DONE ANYTHING
LIKE THAT BEFORE?

36:08.730 --> 36:10.152
NO.

36:10.200 --> 36:13.522
BUT EVEN FROM THE BEGINNING,
SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR
RELATIONSHIP WAS WRONG,

36:13.570 --> 36:14.537
OBSESSIVE.

36:14.570 --> 36:15.969
WHAT? LIKE...

36:16.000 --> 36:17.638
WEARING EACH OTHER'S MAKEUP?

36:17.670 --> 36:18.830
CLOTH ES?

36:18.870 --> 36:21.532
MORE LIKE WEARING EACH OTHER'S
PERSONALITIES.

36:22.510 --> 36:23.772
THAT'S PRETTY MESSED-UP.

36:23.810 --> 36:25.243
YEAH, BUT IT MAKES SENSE.

36:25.280 --> 36:28.613
REMEMBER, THAT GUY HECTOR
SAID THAT ALI WANTED MASKS
OF HER FACE MADE

36:28.650 --> 36:30.538
SO THAT HER FRIENDS
WOULD LOOK MORE LIKE HER?

36:30.580 --> 36:32.241
I THOUGHT THAT
WAS A DIG AT US.

36:32.290 --> 36:34.508
SO DID I, BUT APPARENTLY
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT CECE.

36:35.520 --> 36:36.509
HI.

36:36.560 --> 36:37.788
HI.

36:37.820 --> 36:39.526
I WASN'T SURE IF YOU'D
BE HOME FOR DINNER.

36:39.560 --> 36:41.824
OH, NO, I THOUGHT WE
COULD JUST ORDER A PIZZA.

36:41.860 --> 36:43.589
OKAY, SURE.

36:44.670 --> 36:47.525
HONEY, HAVE YOU
SPOKEN TO YOUR MOM LATELY?

36:47.570 --> 36:49.333
UH, NOT SINCE EARLIER.
WHY?

36:50.400 --> 36:52.436
I--YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
HEAD HOME.

36:52.470 --> 36:54.609
MRS. HASTINGS,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

36:54.640 --> 36:57.507
SOMEONE MADE AN ANONYMOUS
COMPLAINT TO THE COURT.

36:57.540 --> 37:00.407
THEY'RE ACCUSING ME
OF OBSTRUCT ION OF JUSTICE.

37:00.450 --> 37:01.576
WHAT?!

37:01.620 --> 37:03.315
THEY'RE ALLEGING
THAT I BULLIED MONA

37:03.350 --> 37:04.715
INTO...GIVING HER CONFESSION.

37:04.750 --> 37:06.547
Spencer: THAT'S CRAZY.

37:06.590 --> 37:09.252
I KNOW.
AND THE CHARGES
WON'T HOLD WATER FOR LONG,

37:09.290 --> 37:11.281
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
THE DAMAGE IS DONE.

37:11.330 --> 37:12.149
WHAT DAMAGE?

37:12.190 --> 37:13.953
IN ORDER NOT TO HURT
YOUR MOTHER'S CASE,

37:13.990 --> 37:15.457
I HAVE TO RECUSE MYSELF.

37:15.500 --> 37:16.455
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

37:16.500 --> 37:17.751
IT MEANS...

37:17.800 --> 37:20.621
RIGHT NOW, YOUR MOTHER
DOESN'T HAVE A LAWYER.

37:33.510 --> 37:34.716
LATE.
( chuckles )

37:34.750 --> 37:36.115
IT'S OKAY.

37:36.150 --> 37:38.914
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,
MY PLAN WASN'T TO BROWN-BAG
IT ON A STOOP.

37:38.950 --> 37:41.350
MY PLAN WAS TO TAKE YOU
SOMEWHERE NICE.
HEY, IT'S FINE.

37:41.390 --> 37:43.017
FINE.
LIKE STEAK OR--OR SOMETHING.

37:43.060 --> 37:44.015
IT--

37:44.060 --> 37:46.426
I...DON'T EAT MEAT.

37:46.460 --> 37:47.722
AT ALL.

37:47.760 --> 37:49.352
AH.
( chuckles )

37:49.400 --> 37:52.858
WELL, I'M GLAD
I DIDN'T DO THAT.

37:59.570 --> 38:02.778
WHAT, THAT SAUCE A LITTLE
TOO SPICY FOR YOU, SPORT?

38:02.810 --> 38:04.607
UH--

38:04.650 --> 38:05.776
( sighs )

38:05.810 --> 38:07.402
EXCUSE ME?

38:07.450 --> 38:08.872
I LOVE SPICY FOOD.
MMM.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.774
NO, IT'S JUST, UH,

38:10.820 --> 38:12.640
THIS SCRATCH DOESN'T.

38:12.690 --> 38:13.918
( chuckles )

38:13.950 --> 38:15.417
GIMME THAT.
GIVE IT TO ME.

38:15.460 --> 38:16.688
OH.

38:16.720 --> 38:17.755

38:19.660 --> 38:20.786
SORRY, IT'S JUST...

38:20.830 --> 38:23.458
SO TINY I CAN'T REALLY
SEE IT IN THIS LIGHT.

38:23.500 --> 38:24.626
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.023
NO KIDDING, THOUGH--

38:26.070 --> 38:27.867
THAT GUY GOT ME
RIGHT IN THE JAW.

38:27.900 --> 38:29.595
MY MOUTH HURTS
JUST MOVIN' IT.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.938
H-HOW IS A TOTAL BADASS

38:31.970 --> 38:32.937
WHO WON HIS MATCH TONIGHT,

38:37.510 --> 38:39.569
SO...

38:39.610 --> 38:40.440
THINK I'M A BADASS?

38:40.480 --> 38:43.449
NO, NOT AT ALL.
I THINK YOU'RE A FAKER.

38:43.480 --> 38:45.084
YOU'RE GRINNING
FROM EAR TO EAR RIGHT NOW.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.610
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE
HURTING AT ALL.

38:46.650 --> 38:48.311
I CAN'T HELP IT.

38:50.020 --> 38:52.352
YOU'RE HERE WITH ME
ON A STOOP...

38:52.390 --> 38:53.357

39:04.140 --> 39:07.667

OF THE LIGHT *

39:07.710 --> 39:09.473

HOW ABOUT THIS?

39:12.150 --> 39:15.119
* AND I CAN'T
SLEEP ALONE AT NIGHT *

39:34.900 --> 39:36.731
HI. HOW WAS WORK?

39:36.770 --> 39:38.032
FINE. FINE.

39:38.070 --> 39:39.799
WHAT ARE YOU KNITTING?

39:39.840 --> 39:42.104
WHAT WAS GOING TO BE
A SCARF FOR MY HUSBAND,

39:42.140 --> 39:45.507
BUT NOW I GUESS IT'LL
BE A TIGHT SWEATER FOR ME.

39:46.980 --> 39:49.676
BY THE WAY,
YOU CAN CALL ME JESSICA.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.517
THE CIRCUIT BREAKER
WAS BLOWN.

39:51.550 --> 39:52.983
AH, SO,

39:53.020 --> 39:54.453
I REPLACED IT,

39:54.490 --> 39:56.481
AND IT SHOULD START
TO WARM UP IN HERE

39:56.520 --> 39:57.612
IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES.

39:57.660 --> 39:59.525
GREAT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

39:59.560 --> 40:00.857
YEAH, UM,

KNOW HOW TO SAY THIS,

40:02.630 --> 40:05.394
BUT...LOOKS LIKE YOU
HAVE A BIGGER PROBLEM.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.802
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF--
THIS ISN'T TRUE.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.603
WON'T THIS ALL
JUST BLOW OVER?

40:13.640 --> 40:16.029
THE PROSECUTION STILL MIGHT
TRY TO USE IT IN THE TRIAL.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.707
AND WE JUST CAN'T RISK THAT.

40:17.740 --> 40:19.549

I HAVE TO GO SEE MY MOM.
OKAY, I'LL JOIN YOU.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.552

IT'S VERY UPSETTING.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.962

LAPSE IN JUDGMENT.

40:47.710 --> 40:50.008
WELL I WAS BEGINNING TO SUSPECT
THE CONFESSION WAS COERCED,

40:50.040 --> 40:51.905
BUT YEAH I WAS SHOCKED
WHEN I LEARNED

40:51.950 --> 40:53.599
IT WAS MY FORMER
MOTHER-IN-LAW.

40:53.650 --> 40:56.175
ALMOST MOTHER-IN-LAW.

40:58.080 --> 41:00.480

A BULLET THERE.

41:56.010 --> 41:56.977
OVER THERE.

41:57.010 --> 41:59.274
* THEY'RE RISING DAILY

42:01.280 --> 42:03.214
* BUT HOME

42:03.250 --> 42:04.786
Mrs. DiLaurentis:
HE'S RIGHT.

42:04.820 --> 42:07.015
IT DEFINITELY LOOKS LIKE
SOMEBODY USED THIS

42:07.050 --> 42:09.189
AS THEIR TEMPORARY HOME.

42:10.660 --> 42:12.059
OH, SHOULD WE...

42:12.090 --> 42:13.887
MAYBE CALL THE POLICE?

42:13.930 --> 42:16.296
I'M SURE THEY'RE LONG GONE.

42:16.330 --> 42:19.299
MY GUESS IS THEY MOVED OUT
BEFORE JASON MOVED BACK IN.

42:19.330 --> 42:23.061
UNFORTUNATELY,
THEY LEI-T US QUITE A MESS.

42:24.200 --> 42:26.202
MAYBE I CAN GET THE GARDENER
TO CLEAR THAT OUT.

42:26.240 --> 42:27.798
( sighs )

42:29.680 --> 42:31.978
HEY, I'M GONNA HEAT UP
SOME LASAGNA.

42:32.010 --> 42:33.546
YOU MUST BE STARVING.

42:35.650 --> 42:37.311
* I BLEW UP YOUR BODY

42:37.350 --> 42:39.545
( footsteps )

42:42.360 --> 42:44.726
* BUT YOU BLEW MY MIND

42:44.760 --> 42:46.955
**

43:02.340 --> 43:06.606
* OH THOSE HEARTACHES
( footsteps )

43:12.820 --> 43:14.617
**

43:49.260 --> 43:51.251
**
