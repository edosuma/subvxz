01:04.800 --> 01:08.327
It's a simple fact
that not everyone is destined

01:08.400 --> 01:10.687
to claim their page in the history books.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.406
But a lot of people

01:12.480 --> 01:14.847
are willing to pay for a piece of it.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.486
<i>Pope, you are about to break</i>

01:22.600 --> 01:24.682
the NFL single-season sack record,

01:24.720 --> 01:29.044
and when you do, you deserve
to cash in, plain and simple.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.521
That's where Seven Figures
Management comes in.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.803
We make sure that when you reach
a career milestone like that,

01:35.840 --> 01:37.490
that you are rewarded
for that achievement,

01:37.520 --> 01:41.844
in short, that you get paid very well.

01:43.840 --> 01:46.411
Now, my question to you, Popo, is...

01:47.320 --> 01:49.288
Will you let me help you do that?

01:54.560 --> 01:55.891
- That was perfect.
- Yeah?

01:55.920 --> 01:57.729
Yes, that was amazing.

01:57.840 --> 01:59.251
He's here, JB.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.364
- What? He's early.
- He's still here.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.685
Okay, time to go. Let's do this.

02:07.720 --> 02:09.882
Knock him dead, partner.

02:11.400 --> 02:14.210
That's where Seven Figures
Management comes in.

02:14.320 --> 02:17.081
We make sure that when you reach
a milestone like that in your career,

02:17.440 --> 02:19.886
that you are rewarded
for that achievement.

02:20.960 --> 02:23.167
So my question to you
is very simple, Popo.

02:25.360 --> 02:28.125
Will you let me help you do that?

02:31.920 --> 02:33.001
Yeah, I will.

02:35.280 --> 02:38.762
Well, that is...
That is good news, Popo.

02:38.840 --> 02:40.251
Why are we wasting time in here?

02:40.280 --> 02:41.611
Let me go get your paperwork started,

02:41.720 --> 02:44.087
and then I'll introduce you
to your new team.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.326
Cool.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.080
Oh. Just one more thing, JB.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.167
Name it.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.163
I'm gonna need a
million-dollar signing bonus.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.008
- What?
- You know, like, a million in cash.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.087
Up front.

02:59.280 --> 03:02.170
Oh... Okay, Popo...

03:03.600 --> 03:07.207
I can't do that.
I mean, that just doesn't happen.

03:07.560 --> 03:10.450
- I mean, no one can do that.
- Procorp can.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.125
Paul Carter, please.

04:01.480 --> 04:03.323
Paul, hey. JB Bernstein.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.170
I'm great. Thank you.

04:09.680 --> 04:10.681
Um...

04:11.960 --> 04:13.928
No, the reason I'm calling is

04:14.000 --> 04:16.207
'cause I wanted to let you know that I

04:18.000 --> 04:20.367
can't get you that check this week.

04:22.920 --> 04:25.810
No. No, no, no.
We still want the office space.

04:27.040 --> 04:30.203
Uh, just a couple more months.

04:30.720 --> 04:31.881
I didn't even know

04:32.240 --> 04:33.280
he was talking to Procorp.

04:33.320 --> 04:34.845
Well, they got to him.

04:34.880 --> 04:37.531
Yeah, you know, what they're
doing is completely unethical, okay?

04:37.600 --> 04:40.968
We've been grooming the guy for six
months. I mean, six months. Come on.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.963
And then, poof, he's gone.
They bought him?

04:44.800 --> 04:45.961
Speak of the devil.

04:50.480 --> 04:52.801
I hate them so much.

05:06.320 --> 05:07.651
We just need another play.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.051
We don't have another play, okay?

05:09.120 --> 05:11.088
They just bought our play.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.731
And we can't compete with them.
They're too big.

05:13.760 --> 05:16.240
You want to go back? Huh?

05:16.640 --> 05:18.051
You wanna work at the Death Star?

05:18.080 --> 05:20.287
No, I don't wanna work at the Death Star.
I hated the Death Star.

05:20.360 --> 05:22.249
I wanna work for us,
I wanna work for you, but, look,

05:22.320 --> 05:25.722
come on, this is not really working.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.366
Yet. It's not working yet.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.244
Come on. May I remind you, please,
that we had some very good clients.

05:31.320 --> 05:33.448
Emmitt Smith,
Barry Sanders, Curtis Martin.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.370
Okay. May I remind you
that they are all retired.

05:36.400 --> 05:40.610
My point is simply that we did it before,
we can do it again.

05:40.680 --> 05:44.082
That's how this works.
We just have to hold it together.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.128
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome</i>

05:46.240 --> 05:48.402
<i>the Los Angeles Clippers!</i>

05:49.440 --> 05:51.283
I feel sick. Can we go?

05:52.600 --> 05:54.409
How about that
baseball owner you know?

05:54.440 --> 05:56.568
- What was his name?
- William Chang.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.364
Big money guy out of San Francisco

05:58.440 --> 06:00.602
looking for
investment opportunities in Asia.

06:00.680 --> 06:02.682
Except we don't have anything in Asia.

06:02.760 --> 06:05.570
Maybe we should find something.
Think about Yao Ming.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.365
That dude's worth a hundred million
in Chinese endorsements.

06:08.440 --> 06:09.601
We just need to find our Yao.

06:09.680 --> 06:12.923
Okay. When it comes to China,
we are late to the party. China's tapped.

06:12.960 --> 06:15.406
- Fine, Taiwan.
- Tapped.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.090
- South Korea.
- Tapped.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.805
North Korea.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.087
Great. I'll set up a meeting.

06:22.160 --> 06:25.323
All right. Well, then, this.
What if we go young?

06:25.400 --> 06:27.368
- Mmm-hmm.
- Find some kid, develop the talent.

06:27.440 --> 06:28.646
Get in on the ground floor.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.967
Mmm. Hey, the Red Sox
just signed an 8-year-old.

06:32.880 --> 06:35.167
All right.
Maybe we hang out at maternity wards.

06:35.240 --> 06:37.641
Yeah, last time I did that,
I came home with twins.

06:38.640 --> 06:41.325
Right. Bad idea.

06:41.360 --> 06:44.489
Hey, listen, you are gonna love it
when it happens to you.

06:45.160 --> 06:47.322
You just need to jump on in.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.687
Ah, look at that. Cricket.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.361
- Oh, come on.
- Come on. it relaxes me, all right?

06:53.440 --> 06:55.488
I used to watch this with my dad.
It's a great game.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.050
- It's not a great game.
- It is a great game.

06:57.120 --> 06:59.327
It looks like
an insane asylum was opened up

06:59.400 --> 07:01.323
and all the inmates were
allowed to create a sport.

07:01.360 --> 07:04.648
That is just not true.
Okay? A billion people play this game.

07:04.680 --> 07:06.808
I don't care.
It's because anybody can play it.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.842
There's no discernible rules.

07:08.880 --> 07:11.850
You hit the ball anywhere you want
and it's apparently fair.

07:11.920 --> 07:14.890
And then you run back and forth
and tag each other with bats.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.361
This is nonsense.
Toddlers can play this game.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.402
Okay, are you even listening
to yourself right now?

07:19.480 --> 07:21.050
Do you realize
how stupid you sound?

07:22.440 --> 07:24.010
It is a brilliant game.

07:25.400 --> 07:26.447
And I am in trouble.

07:27.320 --> 07:29.049
You're not driving.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.964
Oh, my wife loves it

07:31.040 --> 07:33.805
when I have to take a cab
home 'cause I'm so intoxicated.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.722
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:38.920 --> 07:40.410
- Good night, guys.
- Night.

07:41.680 --> 07:44.923
- Who's that?
- What? She's my tenant.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.604
She lives in
the bungalow out back.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.330
Wow. Backyard hottie.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.644
No. She's not my type.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.722
Oh, really?

07:52.760 --> 07:56.048
Why? Because she's not a model?

07:56.120 --> 07:57.451
Yeah, 'cause she's not a model.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.568
What is wrong with you, okay?
She's cute.

07:59.640 --> 08:02.246
Have you seen her?
She's cute. And what does she do?

08:02.320 --> 08:03.765
I don't know.
She's studying to be a doctor.

08:03.840 --> 08:07.481
Oh, she's studying to be a doctor.
Oh, my God. Ew!

08:07.720 --> 08:09.245
Yeah, stay away from that.

08:09.320 --> 08:12.403
Because she's not a model
and she's smart. That's terrible.

08:14.920 --> 08:17.400
- MaÃ±ana, bro.
- All right. Get home safe.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.408
We're gonna figure this out.

08:26.160 --> 08:29.243
I don't know how much longer
I can do this, JB.

08:32.159 --> 08:34.924
Look, we said we were gonna give
it two years on our own,

08:34.960 --> 08:36.563
and it's been three now

08:36.600 --> 08:38.921
and we still can't seem
to sign a new client.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.128
Yeah, I know. I'm aware of that.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.690
But, look, we just need one big client...

08:42.760 --> 08:46.003
Yeah, that was Popo. Popo was our guy.

08:50.400 --> 08:53.609
I don't want to quit on you. I don't.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.203
I just don't know what else to do.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.365
We're gonna crack this thing, Aash.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.681
All right.

09:11.320 --> 09:12.810
We're gonna crack it, Aash.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.729
<i>I dreamed</i> a <i>dream
in time gone by</i>

09:32.920 --> 09:35.969
<i>When hope was high
and life worth living...</i>

09:36.000 --> 09:38.844
<i>Youse didn't expect that,
did you? Did you? No.</i>

09:38.920 --> 09:42.811
<i>I dreamed that love
would never die...</i>

09:46.040 --> 09:47.724
<i>...in front to have in the back...</i>

09:47.800 --> 09:48.961
...downtown Los Angeles...

09:49.000 --> 09:52.322
<i>...oxygen to every load
to boost your detergent...</i>

09:52.360 --> 09:54.647
<i>Certainly</i>
a <i>big series for Matt Prior.</i>

09:54.680 --> 09:57.251
<i>Disappointing against
the Indians in the test.</i>

09:57.320 --> 09:59.721
<i>- Seventy runs.
- Chance to make amends today.</i>

09:59.800 --> 10:00.881
<i>One of the things about...</i>

10:00.960 --> 10:02.928
...die

10:03.480 --> 10:07.610
<i>I dreamed that God would be forgiving</i>

10:10.160 --> 10:14.165
<i>Then I was young and unafraid...</i>

10:15.920 --> 10:17.729
<i>...of the wicket, a wide half-volley.</i>

10:17.760 --> 10:19.842
- Cook knows it.
- Oh, my.

10:20.240 --> 10:23.722
<i>So different from this hell I'm living...</i>

10:24.240 --> 10:26.368
<i>It's been a successful</i>

10:26.440 --> 10:28.363
<i>performance from Alastair Cook...</i>

10:44.160 --> 10:46.970
Hey. How fast do they pitch in cricket?

10:48.840 --> 10:51.810
Fine, bowl.
How fast do they bowl in cricket?

10:54.040 --> 10:56.850
You know what?
Get me a meeting with Chang this week.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.368
I think I cracked this.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.605
They don't play baseball in India.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.728
That's right. They don't.
They play cricket.

11:06.760 --> 11:12.005
But we think that we can convert
a cricket bowler into a baseball pitcher.

11:12.760 --> 11:16.560
Look, India is the last
great untapped market.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.570
We find new fans there
for American baseball,

11:19.600 --> 11:21.921
the financial opportunities are endless.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.049
Mr. Chang, if we can deliver
to Major League Baseball

11:25.120 --> 11:27.771
its first Indian ballplayer,

11:27.840 --> 11:29.649
that's a billion new fans.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.644
What do a billion new fans need?

11:31.720 --> 11:34.121
A billion hats. A billion T-shirts.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.965
And you wanna set this up
like it's a talent contest?

11:38.040 --> 11:39.201
Exactly.

11:39.280 --> 11:43.126
That will ensure
maximum exposure of talent to press.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.565
See, once we go over there
and find these guys,

11:45.640 --> 11:48.325
we bring them back here,
we train them in LA,

11:48.400 --> 11:50.681
and then we get them signed
with a professional franchise.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.521
- What's your timeline?
- Two years.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.491
Can you do it in one?

12:01.160 --> 12:02.321
Sure.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.887
Really? A year? Because
I thought we said two.

12:05.960 --> 12:06.961
I had to hook him.

12:07.040 --> 12:09.805
Okay, we can't find
and train two nobodies in a year.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.001
It can't be done.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.485
Well, without this deal, we're done.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.801
So I just saved our business, Aash.
You should be thanking me.

12:14.840 --> 12:17.286
Oh, I would thank you
if the deal wasn't insane.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.290
- Well, apparently Chang didn't think so.
- Chang is rich.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.765
You know what rich people can do?

12:21.840 --> 12:23.808
They can be insane. We can't, okay?

12:23.840 --> 12:26.161
We can't find somebody
who has never picked up a baseball

12:26.240 --> 12:28.004
and teach them how to pitch.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.765
You're right, we can't.
But I know someone who can.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.044
Cross it over.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.485
Bend it deep.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.204
Pre-set your fanny.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.809
Lift and plant hard.

12:42.320 --> 12:43.560
Thank you.

12:44.120 --> 12:45.770
That's our guy. Tom House.

12:45.840 --> 12:46.921
Glove out front.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.001
PhD in psychology-

12:48.040 --> 12:49.883
Thirty years in the big leagues
as a player and a coach.

12:49.960 --> 12:51.246
Don't move your head.

12:51.320 --> 12:53.527
Half of baseball thinks
he's absolutely crazy,

12:53.560 --> 12:56.006
but you can't argue with his results.

12:56.040 --> 12:58.964
Ball on wall. Glove on wall. Knee on wall.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.605
If anybody can do it, he can.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.523
It can't be done.

13:02.600 --> 13:06.730
Cricket and baseball are two
completely different throwing motions.

13:07.560 --> 13:10.211
The biomechanics,
the timing, the sequencing,

13:10.280 --> 13:11.930
it's just not the same at all.

13:12.160 --> 13:16.051
I mean, even if you found me
a couple of kids,

13:16.080 --> 13:18.560
there's no way they'd be ready
for a pro tryout,

13:18.640 --> 13:19.880
not in a year.

13:20.240 --> 13:21.605
So you're saying it's impossible?

13:21.680 --> 13:23.569
I'm not saying it's impossible.

13:23.600 --> 13:27.764
I'm just saying it's...
It's highly improbable.

13:29.320 --> 13:32.085
Why don't you consider it
a highly improbable challenge?

13:32.400 --> 13:34.641
Think about it.
If it doesn't work, who cares?

13:34.720 --> 13:35.767
No harm, no foul.

13:36.360 --> 13:38.169
But if it does work

13:38.240 --> 13:40.083
and you take two kids
from the middle of India

13:40.160 --> 13:41.969
who've never picked up
a baseball in their lives

13:42.040 --> 13:45.442
and turn them into
Major League prospects in one year...

13:46.240 --> 13:50.040
Well, I can't think of a better plug

13:50.080 --> 13:51.969
for your methods than that, can you?

13:54.600 --> 13:57.968
You certainly don't need any
help with your pitching, do you?

13:58.040 --> 14:00.008
<i>JB,
I've been through the entire list.</i>

14:00.080 --> 14:01.923
I cannot find a single
Major League scout

14:02.000 --> 14:04.367
that's willing to travel around India
for three months.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.442
I can't be there
without a scout of some kind.

14:06.520 --> 14:07.567
<i>Yeah, no kidding.</i>

14:07.600 --> 14:10.251
I need someone that's gonna be there
in a month for the start of qualifiers.

14:10.280 --> 14:12.328
<i>- I know that.
- Hold on. Hold on.</i>

14:12.400 --> 14:13.447
Hi. Are you leaving?

14:13.480 --> 14:15.050
- Yeah, I have to go.
- Don't go.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.168
I have to. Don't forget about me.

14:17.240 --> 14:19.288
<i>I will not forget about you.
I'll miss you.</i>

14:19.320 --> 14:21.129
Okay. Bring me something.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.441
- I will bring you something.
- You better.

14:25.440 --> 14:26.805
<i>You know, I really wish
I hadn't heard that.</i>

14:26.840 --> 14:27.887
Bye.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.247
Yeah, well, if you saw her,
you would understand.

14:30.280 --> 14:33.284
- Send me a picture of her?
- No, I'm not sending you...

14:33.320 --> 14:34.481
Are we 14?

14:34.800 --> 14:36.290
I have to call you back.

14:38.800 --> 14:39.881
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:39.960 --> 14:42.440
My washing machine's broken again.
This time I think it's dead.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.489
- Why?
- Yeah, well, it's smoking.

14:44.560 --> 14:47.325
Literally, from the back.
And it's making this really loud noise.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.482
It's similar to ker-chug,
ker-chug, ker-chug.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.488
Okay, okay, Okay-

14:51.520 --> 14:53.488
I'm leaving for India today.

14:53.520 --> 14:54.646
Oh, that's cool.

14:54.680 --> 14:56.409
So I don't really have time
to deal with this.

14:56.480 --> 14:59.450
And I also really don't
have the money right now.

14:59.480 --> 15:01.403
So could you do me a favor

15:01.480 --> 15:04.131
and could you,
while I'm gone, just use mine?

15:07.840 --> 15:10.320
Could you throw in free detergent
and the use of your barbecue?

15:12.520 --> 15:14.807
- Okay, deal.
- All right, deal. Thanks, man.

15:14.840 --> 15:16.842
- You're welcome.
- Gracias.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.080
I think I'm ready.

16:03.440 --> 16:07.240
Oh! Okay. Hi, Theresa.
Vivek never showed up.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.440
Been waiting there for three hours.
I'm in a cab now.

16:09.880 --> 16:12.611
Well, if you hear from him,
have him call me on this mobile.

16:12.920 --> 16:14.922
You have it? Okay.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.401
Bye.

16:16.480 --> 16:18.084
What is with all the honking?

16:18.480 --> 16:20.323
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

16:28.680 --> 16:29.681
Sorry.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.484
Sir. That's the place, sir.

16:31.560 --> 16:33.528
- Here.
- 183?

16:33.560 --> 16:35.562
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Upstairs, upstairs.

16:37.240 --> 16:38.810
All right. All right.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.447
Thank you.

16:50.840 --> 16:52.729
Hi, there. Excuse me. Sorry.

16:52.760 --> 16:55.286
Whoops. Yep, there we go.
That's my fault.

16:56.280 --> 16:59.727
Can you tell me which one 3B is?

17:03.480 --> 17:06.450
Hello. I'm JB Bernstein.

17:06.520 --> 17:10.002
JBB, sir. Hello. I'm Vivek.

17:10.079 --> 17:12.287
Weren't you supposed to pick me up
at the airport today?

17:13.960 --> 17:16.327
Yes, but that is tomorrow.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.242
No, Vivek, today.

17:18.280 --> 17:20.169
That's why I'm standing here.

17:21.119 --> 17:23.964
I was certain that it was tomorrow, JB sir.

17:25.560 --> 17:26.971
I tried calling you all day.

17:27.200 --> 17:29.123
The telephone lines are not up yet

17:29.160 --> 17:30.844
and I've been busy
on my cell phone, you know,

17:30.920 --> 17:32.445
trying to resolve the issue.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.323
But, anyway, you are here now.

17:34.520 --> 17:38.491
We are very excited about
<i>Million</i> Dollar Arm, JBB, sir.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.485
Thank you. And it's just JB.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.166
- Okay.
- One "B."

17:43.240 --> 17:45.368
- JB.
- No "sir."

17:45.440 --> 17:47.920
- So this is our office?
- Yes, JB.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.490
Is there always this much traffic?

17:50.560 --> 17:53.848
There's always traffic in Mumbai, JB.

17:53.880 --> 17:55.120
What's with the honking?

17:55.160 --> 17:56.810
Indians love honking, JB.

17:56.840 --> 17:59.161
I don't know why.
It doesn't help.

17:59.240 --> 18:01.971
Anyway, you settle down,
and then whenever you are ready,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.571
we can have a status report meeting.

18:04.640 --> 18:06.608
Great. I'm ready. Let's do it.

18:08.840 --> 18:10.888
- Right away?
- Yes.

18:11.360 --> 18:12.566
Oh, okay.

18:19.080 --> 18:21.208
First of all, I am happy to inform you

18:21.280 --> 18:24.124
that all our plans
are running smoothly and on time.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.202
Great. Can I see the flyers?

18:26.240 --> 18:28.607
Flyers are not here yet.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.490
They are at the printers.
We are trying to get them.

18:31.600 --> 18:34.046
Okay. How about the T-shirts?

18:34.080 --> 18:35.127
They are at the warehouse.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.328
We are trying to get them, too.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.323
Okay, but the equipment
that we sent over,

18:40.360 --> 18:43.807
the batting cages, balls, bats,
that's all here?

18:43.880 --> 18:48.044
I'm happy to confirm that
they all are here in India.

18:48.840 --> 18:51.810
But you don't have them here?

18:52.040 --> 18:53.883
No. They are at the customs.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.605
I think we should be working on that.

18:56.680 --> 19:01.402
Okay, Vivek, I need things
to run on time and smoothly,

19:01.440 --> 19:03.681
but actually run on time and smoothly,

19:03.720 --> 19:06.291
not Indian on time and smoothly.

19:06.360 --> 19:07.885
You know, here in India, we do things

19:08.000 --> 19:10.401
a little differently than in the US.

19:13.960 --> 19:15.485
Okay, so,

19:16.720 --> 19:18.927
what do we have to do to get our stuff?

19:20.360 --> 19:22.124
Uh, we have to pay money.

19:22.880 --> 19:25.690
Pay money. Like a bribe?

19:25.760 --> 19:28.764
No, no, no. Not a... Not a bribe.

19:28.840 --> 19:30.763
I mean, why use such words?

19:30.840 --> 19:32.604
We call it "bypassing the system."

19:32.760 --> 19:37.561
The systems in India are very slow,
so we bypass them.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.729
- By paying money.
- That's the Indian way.

19:40.760 --> 19:43.604
Indians love honking
and bypassing the system.

19:44.680 --> 19:45.841
Okay.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.446
Let's do it.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.405
He says come after three weeks.

19:56.440 --> 19:58.329
What do you want? You want more?

19:58.400 --> 20:00.129
How much do you want?

20:00.160 --> 20:01.605
Get lost!

20:01.720 --> 20:04.121
Vivek, explain to me why
we can't bypass that guy.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.407
We can, but not in there, JB.

20:06.440 --> 20:10.001
- All right, well, where?
- Ah. Well, I don't know yet.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.286
You know what, Vivek,

20:11.360 --> 20:13.283
I'm starting to lose patience
with this whole plan of yours.

20:13.320 --> 20:16.290
Don't lose patience, JB.
You are going to need it in India.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.804
Ah, here he is.

20:26.320 --> 20:27.765
He says he'll do it here!

20:27.800 --> 20:29.609
Here? In the middle of the street?

20:29.640 --> 20:32.371
That's where he wants
to bypass the system. Really?

20:38.400 --> 20:39.526
Thank you.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.485
Hey. What's up?

20:48.600 --> 20:51.331
- I found our scout.
- Really? Who?

20:51.400 --> 20:53.880
Ray Poitevint. He's one of the best.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.930
He's retired, but House says
he can be there in two weeks.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.129
- Oh, that's great. Great news.
- You're welcome.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.208
All right, listen, I'll call you tomorrow.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.527
<i>All right, I'll see you later.</i>

21:04.560 --> 21:06.369
- Bye.
- Excuse me, sir.

21:06.440 --> 21:09.649
- Are you JB Bernstein?
- Yes, I am.

21:09.680 --> 21:11.728
Hello, sir. I am Amit Rohan.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.370
I love baseball.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.040
I would like very much to work with you
on The <i>Million</i> Dollar Arm.

21:16.080 --> 21:19.050
Great. Tryouts in Mumbai
are at the end of the month.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.366
Come on by.

21:23.080 --> 21:24.366
Lobby, sir.

21:24.440 --> 21:26.966
JB sir, I don't play baseball.

21:27.040 --> 21:29.088
Look at me. Too small to compete.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.208
But I teach baseball in New Mumbai.

21:31.240 --> 21:32.366
- You do?
- Yes, sir.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.243
At my college I have seven students.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.163
Ask me any question
about the game of baseball,

21:36.200 --> 21:38.202
I will tell you. Ask me.

21:38.280 --> 21:39.566
Okay.

21:39.600 --> 21:40.806
How many innings
does a starting pitcher

21:40.880 --> 21:42.245
have to pitch to get the win?

21:45.280 --> 21:46.566
Can you ask me a different question?

21:46.640 --> 21:47.721
No. Goodbye.

21:47.760 --> 21:49.364
Sir. Sir, I'll work for free, sir.

21:52.560 --> 21:53.641
Really?

21:54.560 --> 21:56.403
Yes, sir. I'll work for free.

21:57.120 --> 21:59.282
- When can you start?
- Now, sir.

22:02.040 --> 22:03.485
Now is good. Let's go.

22:03.560 --> 22:04.766
- Really, sir?
- Yes.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.484
- Come.
- After you, please.

22:06.560 --> 22:09.291
Thank you. Thank you, JB sir. Thank
you for this life-changing opportunity.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.362
Don't sweat it. Vivek, this is Amit.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.731
He's gonna be working with us today.

22:12.760 --> 22:13.761
Hello. Amit.

22:13.840 --> 22:14.966
All right, boys, let's go.
We got a big day.

22:15.040 --> 22:16.883
- We gotta spread the word.
- Don't worry, JB.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.605
Indians are very good
at spreading the word.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.331
<i>An American company</i>

22:23.400 --> 22:26.449
<i>is hoping to find a cricketer
to throw a very fast ball.</i>

22:26.520 --> 22:28.045
The prize is worth one hundred...

22:28.080 --> 22:29.491
...thousand US dollars...

22:29.560 --> 22:31.801
...with the chance to win $1 million.

22:35.760 --> 22:37.649
But do you think in a <i>country like India,</i>

22:37.720 --> 22:39.131
where we're obsessed with cricket,

22:39.200 --> 22:41.567
do you really think American
baseball will catch on?

22:58.760 --> 23:01.445
You're sure we don't need a written
contract for the TV studio?

23:01.480 --> 23:02.811
It won't be necessary, JB.

23:02.840 --> 23:05.320
That just seems crazy
to me, even for here.

23:05.360 --> 23:07.681
The TV studios will be there, trust me.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.488
You see, Vivek, in the US,

23:10.560 --> 23:13.166
we would get lawyers
and write up contracts,

23:13.240 --> 23:14.651
and then everything would run smoothly.

23:14.680 --> 23:16.728
But do lawyers and contracts

23:16.800 --> 23:18.848
make things run smoothly in the US?

23:18.920 --> 23:21.082
No, they generally
just confuse the hell out of everything.

23:21.160 --> 23:22.525
But it might make me feel better.

23:22.600 --> 23:23.647
I understand.

23:24.840 --> 23:27.650
JB sir, the Major League
Baseball scout Mr. Ray has arrived.

23:27.720 --> 23:28.881
He is in the taxi.

23:28.960 --> 23:32.009
I went to the airport
to pick him up. It's really exciting.

23:32.040 --> 23:34.008
Fantastic. Bring him up.

23:37.360 --> 23:39.044
We cannot do this.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.161
Ray-

23:45.840 --> 23:46.921
Ray!

23:49.560 --> 23:50.971
Is he breathing?

23:52.720 --> 23:54.563
Yes. Should I take him
to the hospital, sir?

23:54.640 --> 23:56.244
No, no. Hold on a minute.

23:57.320 --> 23:58.446
Hey-

23:58.960 --> 24:00.325
Am I on fire?

24:01.360 --> 24:03.249
No. Sorry about that.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.569
That better be filtered water.

24:06.920 --> 24:09.366
- Who are you?
- I'm JB Bernstein.

24:09.400 --> 24:12.244
- Oh, the agent.
- Yes, the agent.

24:13.040 --> 24:16.089
- Am I in India?
- Yes, yes, India. India, sir.

24:16.160 --> 24:18.970
- They have hotels in India?
- Yes, they do.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.327
Take me to a hotel
and don't wake me up again

24:21.360 --> 24:23.966
until somebody's throwing
a baseball, you got that?

24:24.920 --> 24:28.003
All right, well,
I just wanna say it's nice to meet you,

24:28.040 --> 24:30.168
and get ready, 'cause we're on the road

24:30.200 --> 24:31.565
first thing in the morning, okay?

24:31.600 --> 24:32.886
I can't wait.

24:37.640 --> 24:39.847
- Just take him to the hotel.
- Okay, sir.

24:56.160 --> 24:58.242
All right, today we're in Nashik.

24:58.280 --> 24:59.725
- Nas-hik.
- Nas-hik.

24:59.760 --> 25:02.650
Tomorrow Jaipur, New Delhi,
up to Chandigarh,

25:02.720 --> 25:05.041
then we are in Lucknow, Kolkata,

25:05.080 --> 25:07.924
Bangalore, Goa, then back
to Mumbai for the final.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.129
- How's that sound, Ray?
- Sounds wonderful.

25:11.200 --> 25:13.601
- Are those places?
- They are indeed.

25:13.640 --> 25:14.846
You like being on the road?

25:17.440 --> 25:18.521
Words cannot express.

25:31.160 --> 25:33.527
- They all here for us?
- Yes, JB.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.968
This is awesome.

26:01.480 --> 26:03.323
Things are running very smoothly, JB.

26:03.360 --> 26:04.521
I guess they are.

26:04.600 --> 26:07.046
- This is great.
- We'll see.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.800
Vivek, we've been here half a
day. No one can throw over 45.

26:51.920 --> 26:54.287
JB sir, another 60 men just signed up.

26:54.360 --> 26:55.441
Great.

26:55.520 --> 26:56.760
Ray, how are you gonna
know if anyone can throw

26:56.840 --> 26:58.046
if you keep your eyes shut all day?

26:58.080 --> 26:59.730
- I can hear it.
- Really?

26:59.760 --> 27:01.524
Yeah.

27:01.560 --> 27:03.050
That was about a 43.

27:05.560 --> 27:06.925
<i>In an impressive turnout</i>

27:07.000 --> 27:08.120
<i>in the city of Nashik today,</i>

27:09.320 --> 27:10.924
<i>Hundreds of young
contestants showed up</i>

27:11.000 --> 27:12.764
<i>to try out for the US-based</i>

27:12.840 --> 27:15.161
<i>Million Dollar Arm pitching contest,</i>

27:15.200 --> 27:17.362
<i>which continues to travel across India</i>

27:17.400 --> 27:19.607
<i>in search of a few strong-armed boys.</i>

27:19.720 --> 27:22.690
<i>Today's contestants
showed exceptional enthusiasm</i>

27:22.720 --> 27:24.563
<i>for a sport which they have likely...</i>

27:24.600 --> 27:26.728
Oh, God, what did I eat?

27:26.760 --> 27:28.888
<i>And yet, despite the massive turnout,</i>

27:29.000 --> 27:30.889
<i>it seems to be harder than it looks.</i>

27:38.400 --> 27:40.243
- Hey. <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi, Brenda.

27:40.280 --> 27:42.487
<i>Look, we're skyping. How's India?</i>

27:43.960 --> 27:46.964
It's fine. I'm in the middle
of something. What's up?

27:47.040 --> 27:49.964
<i>I'm sorry. So I don't
mean to be the bearer of bad tidings,</i>

27:50.040 --> 27:52.884
<i>but your washing machine
has broken now, too.</i>

27:52.920 --> 27:55.730
<i>- Seriously?
- I am just gonna pay for it,</i>

27:55.760 --> 27:58.331
<i>- and I'll deduct it out of my rent.
- Fine. Do that.</i>

27:58.400 --> 28:01.370
<i>So how's the contest going?
Are you excited?</i>

28:01.440 --> 28:04.011
I will be if we can
find a kid who can pitch in the 80s.

28:04.080 --> 28:05.923
In... Okay.

28:05.960 --> 28:08.440
<i>Um, how's the food? Is it crazy good?</i>

28:10.800 --> 28:12.160
I should get back to work, Brenda.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.726
<i>Okay. Good luck with the...</i>

28:14.760 --> 28:17.161
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

28:53.640 --> 28:54.766
So many people there.

29:53.760 --> 29:56.411
JB sir, he is saying he is young in spirit.

29:56.520 --> 29:57.726
He wants to try.

29:58.040 --> 30:00.042
- Huh?

30:14.680 --> 30:16.250
What is that, son?

30:17.680 --> 30:19.011
Million Dollar Arm.

30:19.200 --> 30:20.884
You don't play cricket.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.729
It's a contest.

30:22.840 --> 30:25.764
One million US dollars.

30:26.800 --> 30:28.086
This is for kids.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.928
You have work to do.

30:30.960 --> 30:33.042
Real work.

30:44.240 --> 30:46.527
<i>Calling all cricket players!</i>

30:46.600 --> 30:50.321
<i>Come and be a contestant in the
"Million Dollar Arm" contest.</i>

30:50.400 --> 30:51.925
Coach?

30:52.000 --> 30:53.286
What is it, Rinku?

30:53.320 --> 30:57.041
We're all track and field,
not cricket players.

30:57.120 --> 31:04.083
Just because they are calling for cricket
players doesn't mean you can't try out.

31:06.040 --> 31:08.611
I want to sign up, Coach.

31:08.640 --> 31:10.290
So then sign up.

31:10.360 --> 31:12.362
I'm not your secretary, Rinku.

31:13.480 --> 31:17.405
If I won a million dollars,
I bet you would be.

31:17.920 --> 31:20.764
You make a funny joke.

31:21.200 --> 31:23.202
Everyone! 10 laps!

31:23.600 --> 31:24.601
Get up!

31:24.720 --> 31:26.927
Courtesy of Mr. Singh.

31:28.040 --> 31:29.565
This is a total disaster.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.962
Oh, come on, it's not that bad.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.287
Not one of these kids can
throw over 65 miles an hour.

31:34.320 --> 31:36.448
I swear to God, some of 'em
can't even hit the cage.

31:36.480 --> 31:38.050
How's our money holding out?

31:38.120 --> 31:39.121
Well, it's not, but you know what,

31:39.160 --> 31:40.650
don't worry about that. You find our boys

31:40.680 --> 31:43.968
and I will figure out a way
to make the budget work.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.161
What does Ray think?

31:45.200 --> 31:46.690
<i>Well, when he wakes up,
I'll ask him. By the way,</i>

31:46.760 --> 31:48.444
do you think you could
have gotten someone

31:48.480 --> 31:50.005
a little more of this century?

31:50.080 --> 31:52.048
<i>Hey, the price was right, all right?</i>

31:52.120 --> 31:53.565
So stop your complaining.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.250
Where are you?
What city are you in, anyway?

31:55.320 --> 31:57.800
- I'm in Agra.
- Agra? Wait.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.888
That's where the Taj Mahal is, right?

32:00.360 --> 32:02.283
Yeah, no, I'm standing
right in front of it.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.607
<i>- How is it?
- It</i> is <i>white.</i>

32:04.680 --> 32:06.648
Except for the part that's red.

32:06.680 --> 32:08.045
There's a little dog in the foreground.

32:08.120 --> 32:09.804
Come on, man. Seriously,
how is the Taj Mahal?

32:09.840 --> 32:11.080
I've always wanted to see it.

32:11.160 --> 32:14.767
Oh, well, tell you what. Why don't I put
your friend Ray on the phone

32:14.840 --> 32:17.002
and he can give you
his first impressions?

32:18.360 --> 32:20.169
<i>Ray, buddy, how are you?</i>

32:20.840 --> 32:22.524
<i>Hello? Ray?</i>

32:33.600 --> 32:34.840
<i>Sell your friend for cash!</i>

32:38.640 --> 32:41.211
- Hi, Brenda.
- Hey. <i>Hey,</i> JB.

32:41.280 --> 32:43.851
<i>I have some very good news for you.</i>

32:43.880 --> 32:46.884
<i>The repairman came and he fixed
both of our washing machines.</i>

32:46.920 --> 32:48.445
<i>Two for the price of one. Done.</i>

32:48.520 --> 32:50.488
Really? How'd you swing that?

32:50.560 --> 32:53.450
<i>- I slept with him.
- Seriously?</i>

32:53.760 --> 32:56.570
<i>No. But he was
very attractive, I'll give him that.</i>

32:56.600 --> 32:59.683
<i>- How is the contest going?
- Not great.</i>

33:00.320 --> 33:02.243
No one over here can throw a baseball.

33:02.360 --> 33:03.885
<i>Don't worry about it.
You're gonna find your guy,</i>

33:04.040 --> 33:05.769
<i>and then you're gonna
be back here before you know it</i>

33:05.840 --> 33:07.569
<i>regaling a whole new crop of models</i>

33:07.600 --> 33:09.443
<i>to tell your fabulous stories to.</i>

33:09.520 --> 33:10.521
Thanks for the pep talk.

33:10.560 --> 33:13.040
<i>All right, I'm gonna jump in the shower
'cause I got a date tonight.</i>

33:13.080 --> 33:14.445
Really? With who?

33:15.400 --> 33:17.721
<i>- Uh, I'm not gonna tell you.
- Come on.</i>

33:17.760 --> 33:20.240
<i>Fine, the Maytag man. Bye, India.</i>

33:42.080 --> 33:44.048
This place looks like it has potential.

33:44.120 --> 33:47.761
This is Lucknow.
It has a very fine reputation.

33:47.800 --> 33:53.011
Reputation? Good.
Anything related to sports?

33:53.080 --> 33:55.970
Yes, boys from
all over India come here for training.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.968
Well, then there should
be a few qualifiers.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.411
What do you think, Ray? You feeling it?

33:59.440 --> 34:01.124
I'm feeling something.

34:01.160 --> 34:03.811
I think it's the dinner I had last night.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.882
Been there. Brutal.

34:16.600 --> 34:19.922
All right, all right,
we got a couple of contenders here.

34:20.320 --> 34:22.800
<i>One, welsh.</i>

34:23.560 --> 34:25.244
They were all crap.

34:25.320 --> 34:27.004
Thanks, Ray. That's really helpful.

34:27.080 --> 34:28.081
You want me to lie?

34:28.159 --> 34:31.004
I do. I kind of want you
to lie, a little bit.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.206
That sounded good.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.321
Did he just throw 83?

34:40.360 --> 34:43.125
Sure sounded like it.
Let's see if he can do it again.

34:54.840 --> 34:56.170
- Wow!
- Whoa.

34:58.680 --> 35:00.364
Okay. You know what we call that?

35:00.720 --> 35:03.121
- Manslaughter.
- No, we call that juice.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.362
What? You want juice? I'll get it.

35:10.280 --> 35:11.520
No, we just found one kid,

35:11.560 --> 35:12.920
threw four pitches in the mid-80s.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.687
Yeah, he's a little Wild, but I'll take it.

35:15.800 --> 35:18.087
- First time I've seen Ray's smile.
- Bernstein.

35:18.320 --> 35:19.890
- What?
- Check this out.

35:20.120 --> 35:23.522
All right, hold on.
I'll call you back. What?

35:27.440 --> 35:28.965
How long's he been like that?

35:29.200 --> 35:30.804
About a minute.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.564
Is he gonna throw?

35:32.600 --> 35:34.170
I have no idea.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.961
Is that right? 82 with that
motion? Is that even possible?

35:47.080 --> 35:49.162
A lefty with juice.
You don't see that every day.

35:49.240 --> 35:51.208
A lefty with juice is good, sir?

35:51.240 --> 35:53.720
Lefty with juice is great, Amit.

35:53.800 --> 35:56.565
A lefty with juice is money in the bank.

36:00.920 --> 36:02.684
<i>Lucknow was huge for us.</i>

36:02.760 --> 36:05.286
<i>We found four guys there,
and then we got on a roll.</i>

36:05.400 --> 36:08.768
<i>By the time we got to Goa,
we had somehow found 16 more.</i>

36:08.840 --> 36:10.649
<i>I mean, half these kids
never traveled before,</i>

36:10.720 --> 36:12.563
<i>so they were thrilled to come to Mumbai</i>

36:12.600 --> 36:13.931
<i>and train for the finals.</i>

36:14.000 --> 36:15.764
<i>We put them up in a small college</i>

36:15.840 --> 36:17.888
<i>where Amit teaches. Amit hooked it up.</i>

36:17.920 --> 36:21.083
<i>He's been key, 'cause none of these
guys really speak English.</i>

36:21.120 --> 36:22.610
<i>In fact, I asked him to come to the US</i>

36:22.640 --> 36:25.166
<i>and be the translator for the winners.</i>

36:25.240 --> 36:26.969
<i>Ray has graciously offered to stay</i>

36:27.040 --> 36:28.724
<i>and train the boys for the final.</i>

36:28.760 --> 36:30.360
<i>He actually seems to be
enjoying himself.</i>

36:30.400 --> 36:33.051
<i>And Amit has become Ray's protege,</i>

36:33.120 --> 36:37.250
<i>studying all his methods, good and bad.</i>

36:37.440 --> 36:39.169
<i>Hmm. Sounds great.</i>

36:40.880 --> 36:42.405
I don't know if it's great,

36:42.440 --> 36:43.771
but at least it's coming together.

36:43.800 --> 36:46.371
What? JB, you're in Mumbai.

36:46.440 --> 36:48.841
You're doing exactly what
you want. That takes guts.

36:49.160 --> 36:51.288
<i>Personally, I just
can't wait to hear how it all turns out.</i>

36:51.320 --> 36:52.680
That'll cost you a bottle of wine.

36:53.120 --> 36:54.929
<i>- Bottle of Scotch.
- Better.</i>

36:55.920 --> 36:58.810
Deal. So can I see your office?

36:59.320 --> 37:01.561
<i>Well, I'm on the roof now</i>

37:01.640 --> 37:03.608
<i>because the air conditioner is broken.</i>

37:03.640 --> 37:04.880
<i>Shocker.</i>

37:04.960 --> 37:06.485
But here's my view.

37:13.080 --> 37:14.161
Wow.

37:16.480 --> 37:18.960
<i>- Right?</i>
- That is really cool.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.924
Yeah, you kind of have
to have the smells to get the full effect.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.765
- Does it smell so bad?
- Yeah, sometimes.

37:24.840 --> 37:26.683
And then sometimes it smells amazing.

37:26.760 --> 37:29.843
It's a study in extremes,

37:29.880 --> 37:32.121
just like everything else in this place.

37:32.280 --> 37:34.009
Mmm!

37:35.160 --> 37:36.241
Can I see the Taj Mahal?

37:36.320 --> 37:38.288
It's about 700 miles away.

37:38.400 --> 37:41.165
- Oh, damn.
- Hey, Brenda.

37:42.480 --> 37:45.245
<i>Right</i> now? <i>Is</i> he... All right. There's a...

37:45.320 --> 37:47.880
<i>I have to go.
I have to go to see</i> a <i>patient right now.</i>

37:48.200 --> 37:50.328
- Bye-bye, Brenda.
- Bye-bye, Mumbai.

38:05.040 --> 38:08.886
One, two, three.

38:17.320 --> 38:19.766
You used to go to the academy,
didn't you?

38:19.840 --> 38:21.444
Yeah.

38:21.520 --> 38:23.204
Why did you leave?

38:23.240 --> 38:26.562
My father hurt his back.

38:26.600 --> 38:29.410
I had to help drive his truck.

38:29.440 --> 38:30.680
Do you miss it?

38:30.720 --> 38:34.611
You ask a lot of questions!
I'm trying to practice.

38:34.680 --> 38:37.411
<i>OK, ok. Sorry.</i>

38:48.200 --> 38:50.567
Yeah, I miss it.

38:54.920 --> 38:56.524
Did you play cricket?

38:56.600 --> 38:57.601
No.

38:58.400 --> 39:01.131
I hate cricket.

39:01.200 --> 39:03.487
I played field hockey.

39:03.560 --> 39:05.927
I throw the javelin.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.482
I hate cricket, too.

39:09.560 --> 39:12.086
And I suck at it.

39:13.760 --> 39:14.886
I'm Rinku.

39:16.920 --> 39:18.081
I'm Dinesh.

39:21.800 --> 39:26.124
If you win, what are you
going to do with the money?

39:27.440 --> 39:31.286
I'm gonna buy my father a new truck.

39:31.360 --> 39:33.806
I understand.

39:33.840 --> 39:37.049
You should get him a driver, too.

39:37.560 --> 39:40.006
Maybe I will.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.524
Hello, people!

39:46.400 --> 39:49.324
<i>Let's play</i> Million Dollar Arm!

39:50.800 --> 39:53.849
<i>Okay, please welcome our 20 finalists.</i>

39:56.800 --> 39:59.326
This is exciting!
I can't believe we got this far.

39:59.360 --> 40:00.521
We?

40:00.600 --> 40:02.250
Hey, somebody had to
hold down the fort, all right?

40:02.320 --> 40:04.163
I'm here now though.
Look, at this! This is amazing!

40:04.240 --> 40:05.685
What's this got to do
with throwing a baseball?

40:05.760 --> 40:07.205
It's like some kind of circus.

40:07.280 --> 40:10.204
<i>Let's give them
all a round of applause!</i>

40:10.280 --> 40:12.681
<i>They've all worked
very hard to get here.</i>

40:15.360 --> 40:17.283
<i>All right, the time has now come</i>

40:17.320 --> 40:20.290
<i>to separate the men from the boys.</i>

40:20.800 --> 40:21.847
<i>Before we start the game,</i>

40:21.920 --> 40:23.604
<i>I just want to quickly run
through all the rules.</i>

40:23.680 --> 40:25.569
<i>Each player gets 10 throws.</i>

40:25.640 --> 40:28.405
<i>They will be judged
on speed, with bonus points for strikes.</i>

40:28.480 --> 40:30.881
<i>Both the first
and the second place winners</i>

40:30.960 --> 40:32.724
<i>will travel to the United States.</i>

40:32.800 --> 40:35.167
<i>So let's make a rumble!</i>

40:36.760 --> 40:38.285
Can we get sued for that?

40:38.360 --> 40:40.203
It's entirely possible.

40:47.520 --> 40:50.524
<i>Seventy-eight!
Not bad for the first pitch of the day.</i>

40:54.480 --> 40:55.720
Oh!

40:59.440 --> 41:00.646
<i>- Seventy-nine!
- Nice.</i>

41:07.560 --> 41:09.528
<i>Eighty-one! Not bad.</i>

41:10.120 --> 41:13.044
<i>That puts Hement Sharma
in second place.</i>

41:16.040 --> 41:19.840
<i>Oh, seventy-five. Not quite fast
enough for a professional pitcher.</i>

41:22.440 --> 41:26.809
<i>Eighty-two! That will take Avinash
Mehta to the number-one position.</i>

41:26.920 --> 41:28.649
<i>The contest is really heating up,</i>

41:28.720 --> 41:30.927
<i>with just two contestants left to go.</i>

41:32.240 --> 41:36.040
<i>Next up, Dinesh Kumar Patel!</i>

41:56.760 --> 41:59.604
<i>Eighty-four! Our fastest pitch of the day.</i>

41:59.640 --> 42:01.563
<i>And a perfect strike,
which gives him bonus points.</i>

42:01.600 --> 42:02.761
He's gonna be good.

42:05.320 --> 42:06.321
Whoo!

42:26.400 --> 42:28.482
<i>Eighty-six! But no strike.</i>

42:29.080 --> 42:30.411
<i>Eighty-five!</i>

42:31.160 --> 42:33.128
<i>Eighty-seven. Still no strike.</i>

42:33.160 --> 42:35.401
Wow! This kid is throwing hard!

42:35.480 --> 42:37.323
No, he's throwing wild. It could cost him.

42:44.760 --> 42:46.091
<i>Oh, eighty-five!</i>

42:46.160 --> 42:48.640
<i>That just put
Dinesh Kumar Patel in first place</i>

42:48.680 --> 42:54.005
<i>with just one more
contestant and $100,000 on the line!</i>

42:56.520 --> 43:00.730
<i>And finally our last
contestant, Rinku Singh.</i>

43:02.160 --> 43:05.130
- This is the lefty.
- We call him The Flamingo.

43:17.320 --> 43:19.527
Is he gonna throw
the ball or is he gonna stand there?

43:26.640 --> 43:29.610
<i>Eighty-three, and a perfect
strike. That's a strong start.</i>

43:41.720 --> 43:45.361
<i>- Eighty-five! But no strike.</i>
- All right.

43:48.160 --> 43:49.764
<i>A strike, at 82.</i>

43:53.920 --> 43:57.129
<i>Another strike! Eighty-four!</i>

43:57.200 --> 43:59.885
Well, it's gonna be close, but I still have
the spark plug ahead on points.

43:59.920 --> 44:02.048
- Dinesh Patel?
- Yeah.

44:02.080 --> 44:05.687
So, wait, what has
the lefty gotta do to win this thing?

44:05.720 --> 44:08.530
Ninety-six wild,
or a perfect strike over 84.

44:09.080 --> 44:10.605
He's got no shot at 96.

44:11.400 --> 44:13.687
Perfect strike's gonna
be hard under pressure.

44:28.680 --> 44:29.681
Bingo.

44:29.760 --> 44:32.081
<i>A perfect strike!</i>

44:32.120 --> 44:33.326
Yes!

44:33.440 --> 44:34.521
<i>And the winner,</i>

44:34.600 --> 44:38.730
<i>based on his speed
and accuracy, is Rinku Singh!</i>

44:39.360 --> 44:43.490
<i>He's won $100,000 US,
a trip to America,</i>

44:43.560 --> 44:46.530
<i>and a tryout with a Major
League Baseball team!</i>

44:50.040 --> 44:52.168
<i>And in second place, winning $10,000</i>

44:52.240 --> 44:55.449
<i>and also a chance to train
in the United States of America,</i>

44:55.520 --> 44:58.410
<i>is our wonderful Dinesh Kumar Patel!</i>

45:00.280 --> 45:02.487
<i>Congratulations! Well done!</i>

45:03.040 --> 45:05.566
We did it, partner. We really did it!

45:05.600 --> 45:07.443
We did. Thank you, Ray.

45:07.520 --> 45:09.284
Okay, I'm gonna say my goodbyes

45:09.360 --> 45:11.647
and work my way over to an airplane.

45:11.680 --> 45:13.364
- What, are you leaving?
- Yes.

45:13.480 --> 45:16.563
My job is over
and my Barcalounger calls.

45:20.480 --> 45:22.369
He's a strange man.

45:24.120 --> 45:25.451
Yes, he is.

45:28.320 --> 45:30.800
We're already getting
tons of good press about this.

45:30.880 --> 45:32.644
Even Chang is happy.

45:35.760 --> 45:40.163
Wow.
These guys really live in the sticks, huh?

45:41.000 --> 45:42.126
Yes.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.049
You are giving them
a great opportunity, JB.

45:47.120 --> 45:49.691
Well, it's a great
opportunity for all of us, Vivek.

45:49.840 --> 45:53.003
The potential of this thing
is off the chart.

45:53.040 --> 45:54.769
This is the stuff dreams are made of.

45:54.840 --> 45:59.209
Yes, but, JB, these boys
from these villages,

45:59.280 --> 46:01.408
they don't have these dreams.

46:01.480 --> 46:03.721
They don't even leave their villages.

46:04.440 --> 46:07.410
So it's life-changing for them.

46:08.560 --> 46:11.723
And for you, it's a great responsibility.

46:13.960 --> 46:15.849
I wish you well.

46:19.080 --> 46:20.366
Thanks, Vivek.

46:50.560 --> 46:52.722
- I mean, right?
- Yeah, this is intense.

46:52.800 --> 46:56.088
I mean... Oh, look.
A cow is going in the house.

46:56.480 --> 46:57.686
Pretty sure that's a bull

46:57.720 --> 46:59.848
and I'm pretty sure
they go wherever they want. Hi! Whoa!

46:59.920 --> 47:00.921
What?

47:02.080 --> 47:04.242
<i>- No hablo Hindi.
- No hablo?</i>

47:11.840 --> 47:16.050
Dad, do you like it?

47:17.160 --> 47:20.528
Do they know you don't play cricket?

47:20.600 --> 47:25.527
They know.
It doesn't matter, the contest is over.

47:28.440 --> 47:30.442
It's nice...

47:30.520 --> 47:32.841
...but I don't need a new truck.

47:36.640 --> 47:38.130
Dad...

47:40.080 --> 47:42.970
I have to go to America.

47:53.520 --> 47:57.286
I know you will make me proud.

48:04.240 --> 48:06.322
The mother and uncle.

48:11.680 --> 48:13.520
This is the kitchen
and pantry sort of a thing.

48:16.280 --> 48:17.884
This is his room.

48:26.040 --> 48:28.486
- Hi.
- Hi, everybody.

48:39.400 --> 48:41.289
Thank you. Thank you. Wow.

48:48.120 --> 48:49.531
There it is.

48:52.160 --> 48:54.003
- That's a sharp look.
- What do you think?

48:54.080 --> 48:56.003
Can't be the first time. I got a huge head.

49:26.760 --> 49:28.569
She doesn't seem very happy about this.

49:28.640 --> 49:30.449
No. What's up with that?

49:30.520 --> 49:32.329
She just hit pay dirt.

49:40.480 --> 49:43.006
She wants you to
take good care of him, JB.

49:43.080 --> 49:45.560
She says he hasn't been away
from his village, you know.

49:45.640 --> 49:46.687
She's really worried about him.

49:46.720 --> 49:49.883
Yes, yes, of course, of course.

49:49.920 --> 49:53.970
He's gonna have a great time
in LA. Lots of fun.

50:25.520 --> 50:27.727
Ready, bud? Let's go. All right.

50:27.760 --> 50:29.091
Thanks, everybody.

51:13.200 --> 51:15.407
I'm sorry about this traffic.

51:15.480 --> 51:17.084
There's nothing I could do about that.

51:17.160 --> 51:19.162
This is nothing. We're actually moving.

51:19.240 --> 51:21.083
And there's no honking. No honking.

51:21.160 --> 51:23.401
Hey. I'm gonna have these two
over to the house

51:23.480 --> 51:25.244
to watch some cricket.
It'll be nice to watch it

51:25.320 --> 51:26.960
with somebody who
appreciates it for once.

51:27.520 --> 51:30.524
He wants to watch cricket with you.

51:34.640 --> 51:35.687
Actually, they don't like cricket.

51:35.760 --> 51:37.046
What do you mean
they don't like cricket?

51:37.120 --> 51:39.122
- I mean, they don't like cricket.
- They play cricket.

51:39.160 --> 51:41.606
No. He plays javelin.
He plays field hockey.

51:43.160 --> 51:44.810
- Wait. What?
- Yes.

51:44.840 --> 51:46.205
You didn't know this?

51:46.280 --> 51:47.800
No. I thought they all played cricket.

51:48.840 --> 51:52.162
- "They all played cricket?"
- What, now I'm a racist?

51:52.320 --> 51:54.721
- It sounded a little bit racist.
- It's not racist.

51:54.840 --> 51:56.444
There's 1.8 billion people in this country

51:56.520 --> 51:58.090
and they all love cricket.

51:58.160 --> 52:01.130
Most of them love cricket.
Aash, this was your idea.

52:01.200 --> 52:03.089
Well, it looks like
somebody dropped the ball.

52:03.160 --> 52:05.208
You like cricket, right?

52:05.280 --> 52:07.089
No, I love baseball.

52:07.200 --> 52:08.929
Oh, unbelievable.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.082
- No, believe me.
- Yeah, I believe you.

52:11.160 --> 52:12.525
You're all gonna watch cricket.

52:12.560 --> 52:14.847
- Come on, guys.
- You'll love this place.

52:14.880 --> 52:16.006
Bye.

52:18.560 --> 52:20.483
No, no, no. This side, this side.

52:24.360 --> 52:25.885
Hold that, please.

52:26.880 --> 52:28.245
- Thanks.
- Sure. Floor?

52:28.320 --> 52:29.401
Five.

52:37.240 --> 52:41.450
Okay. All right. Guys, let 'em close.

52:42.800 --> 52:44.768
Okay, so I'll pick you guys up at 8:30

52:44.840 --> 52:46.440
for your first day of practice tomorrow.

52:48.160 --> 52:50.925
If there's any trouble,
Amit's room is right next door.

52:55.760 --> 52:59.526
I'm not sure what that means, but
we're gonna get some sleep,

52:59.600 --> 53:01.240
and then I'll see
you guys in the morning.

53:06.720 --> 53:07.926
- Great.
- All right.

53:10.040 --> 53:11.644
Big TV.

53:11.720 --> 53:13.882
- Let's go! Hey!
- Yes, sir.

53:14.960 --> 53:16.724
Bye. Good night.

53:24.240 --> 53:25.571
All right, Amit, I'm gonna give you this

53:25.600 --> 53:28.968
because I want you
to record their progress.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.923
- For me? Wow!
- Yes, for you to use.

53:30.960 --> 53:31.961
And then you're gonna
give it back to me.

53:32.040 --> 53:33.041
Oh.

53:33.120 --> 53:34.360
I want you to tape
their workouts, their training,

53:34.480 --> 53:36.289
their daily lives, stuff like that.

53:36.320 --> 53:38.209
I'm gonna use it as a marketing tool.

53:38.800 --> 53:40.040
Got it?

53:40.120 --> 53:42.487
Yes, got it. Record everything.

53:42.800 --> 53:44.360
If there are any problems, you call me.

53:44.400 --> 53:46.528
Yes, yes. I will call you with problem.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.843
So I'll see you tomorrow morning.

53:49.920 --> 53:52.685
Okay. Goodbye, JB sir.
Goodbye, Aash sir.

53:54.160 --> 53:55.840
They're gonna be fine
by themselves, right?

53:55.880 --> 53:57.166
Yeah, course. What do you mean?

53:57.240 --> 53:59.208
I mean, you know,
it's their first time here.

53:59.280 --> 54:01.851
- You saw where they came from.
- They're fine.

54:06.240 --> 54:07.844
Good night.

54:07.920 --> 54:09.570
- Really?
- Oh, boy.

54:09.680 --> 54:10.761
Yeah.

54:42.680 --> 54:43.727
Hey-

54:44.520 --> 54:47.842
Hey. Welcome home.

54:48.200 --> 54:50.362
Thank you. it is good to be back.

54:50.440 --> 54:52.727
- Yeah.
- I got you something.

54:52.760 --> 54:54.410
- Really?
- Yes. It's...

54:55.560 --> 54:57.210
I brought you the Taj Mahal.

54:57.720 --> 54:59.643
I worked a deal
with the Indian government.

54:59.720 --> 55:02.166
This is amazing. I love it.

55:02.200 --> 55:04.407
I have been needing
a mini Taj for so long.

55:04.480 --> 55:05.720
It's beautiful. Thank you.

55:05.840 --> 55:08.127
So you gotta tell me how it all finished.

55:08.240 --> 55:11.164
Uh... Well, I thought we were gonna do
that over a bottle of Scotch.

55:12.240 --> 55:15.244
You're right.
We did have a deal. We had that deal.

55:15.400 --> 55:17.243
- Hey.
- Oh. Um...

55:17.320 --> 55:19.288
- You must be JB.
- I am. Hi.

55:19.360 --> 55:20.805
JB, Mark. Mark, JB.

55:20.920 --> 55:22.729
Hey, man, great to
meet you. And welcome home.

55:22.800 --> 55:24.040
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

55:24.080 --> 55:25.923
- Careful. You're sweaty.
- Sorry, babe.

55:25.960 --> 55:28.611
I actually spent
three months in an ashram in Goa.

55:28.720 --> 55:31.405
I forgot that you did that. Yeah.

55:31.440 --> 55:33.602
- Is that a mini Taj?
- Yeah, look at that.

55:33.680 --> 55:35.444
Hilarious. Nice.

55:35.600 --> 55:37.409
Yeah. I think it's so pretty.

55:37.440 --> 55:39.160
Well, I gotta
take a shower before my shift.

55:39.200 --> 55:40.440
- I just wanted to say hi.
- Yes, you do.

55:40.480 --> 55:41.606
Cool. Nice to meet you.

55:41.640 --> 55:43.200
- You as well. See you, babe.
- See you.

55:44.520 --> 55:46.124
<i>Love the Taj.</i>

55:46.200 --> 55:48.328
Mark's an intern at the hospital.

55:48.400 --> 55:50.323
That's how we first met, so...

55:51.120 --> 55:53.282
- Seems like a great guy.
- Yeah, he is a good guy.

55:53.680 --> 55:55.842
- Seems very fit.
- Yeah, he's a runner.

55:58.200 --> 56:01.249
Well, I gotta unpack
and plug back in and kind of...

56:01.280 --> 56:04.489
Yeah, but I wanna hear about your
trip, so whenever you have...

56:04.560 --> 56:05.971
- We'll do that.
- Okay, good.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.651
All right. Thank you so much for my...

56:27.920 --> 56:31.606
Hello, old friend.

56:42.680 --> 56:43.920
Hello.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.968
Apparently, they
pushed the stop button by mistake

56:46.000 --> 56:47.490
and when the elevator got stuck,

56:47.520 --> 56:49.522
they panicked and pushed
the elevator alarm.

56:49.600 --> 56:51.443
- And then the fire alarm.
- Yes. Okay.

56:51.480 --> 56:53.767
We're not going
to press charges, Mr. Bernstein,

56:53.840 --> 56:56.844
providing that you make other
arrangements for these young men.

56:56.880 --> 56:58.120
When would that have to happen?

56:58.160 --> 56:59.446
Immediately.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.240
No filming here.

57:05.840 --> 57:07.001
Sorry.

57:07.720 --> 57:08.846
What are we gonna do?

57:08.880 --> 57:10.530
I told you, they can't stay on their own.

57:12.320 --> 57:13.685
Fine. Then I'm dropping
them off with you.

57:13.760 --> 57:15.842
<i>No. Are you crazy?
Come on, I have kids.</i>

57:15.880 --> 57:19.487
I have no room, all right? You have lots
of room. Please go to sleep.

57:19.520 --> 57:22.205
Yeah, and I also have a very
nice single person's life

57:22.240 --> 57:24.242
that I'm really looking
forward to getting back to.

57:24.320 --> 57:25.401
All right. Well, you know what?

57:25.480 --> 57:26.720
Look on the bright side.

57:26.800 --> 57:28.370
We're out of money,
so you keeping them

57:28.400 --> 57:29.640
will help us keep our doors open.

57:29.680 --> 57:32.081
- Good night.
- No. Don't hang up.

57:34.120 --> 57:35.246
Go to sleep!

57:40.160 --> 57:41.889
All right, let's go.

57:48.880 --> 57:50.484
D...

57:51.880 --> 57:53.484
Don't touch anything.

57:54.240 --> 57:56.607
- Okay, boys, here we are. Come on in.
- Wow.

57:57.880 --> 58:00.247
This is his house?

58:00.800 --> 58:02.802
All right, we're gonna
keep you guys here

58:02.880 --> 58:05.247
until we figure something out.

58:05.320 --> 58:08.164
This is the living room, TV.

58:08.240 --> 58:11.449
This is the TV.
A thousand-something channels.

58:11.520 --> 58:12.760
Maybe there's some Indian ones.

58:14.400 --> 58:15.925
This is where we eat.

58:17.360 --> 58:18.486
Food. Kitchen.

58:18.560 --> 58:19.800
Plenty of stuff in the fridge.

58:19.880 --> 58:21.530
Please help yourself.

58:22.240 --> 58:23.605
<i>Now... Hey, guys-</i>

58:25.320 --> 58:26.560
Oh. Oh.

58:26.600 --> 58:29.922
I just have one rule.
Try to keep everything nice and neat.

58:32.400 --> 58:34.926
Try not to break
anything, okay? Nice and neat.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.968
Great. Good night.

58:37.760 --> 58:39.888
But, JB sir, um...

58:41.880 --> 58:43.120
Where is your family?

58:44.600 --> 58:46.284
- No family, Amit. Just me.
- Huh?

58:46.320 --> 58:47.401
Just me.

59:00.520 --> 59:02.443
Is she his servant?

59:03.800 --> 59:06.007
She must be.

59:06.080 --> 59:08.128
Well, I overslept.

59:08.720 --> 59:10.848
I think I'm still pretty jet-lagged.

59:15.840 --> 59:19.003
Well, call House and tell him we're
running a few minutes late.

59:19.080 --> 59:20.206
Yeah.

59:21.720 --> 59:24.166
Guys, what are you doing?
Why didn't you wake me up?

59:24.200 --> 59:26.567
Good morning, JB sir.
We were waiting for you for breakfast.

59:27.400 --> 59:29.004
Okay. Okay. Uh...

59:33.200 --> 59:34.486
Breakfast.

59:36.640 --> 59:38.483
What's with all the candles, by the way?

59:38.520 --> 59:41.285
That's our shrine, JB sir,
so that we can pray.

59:42.720 --> 59:45.564
- Oh, right.
- And where do you pray, JB sir?

59:45.640 --> 59:49.645
I don't pray. I work. And I'm late.

59:49.680 --> 59:52.001
So five minutes. We gotta hustle.

59:52.040 --> 59:54.611
Right, JB sir. Five minutes. Ready.

59:55.200 --> 59:58.204
PowerBar. Big body. Eat, eat, eat.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:03.251
JB sir, what is the meaning of "hustle"?

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.800
It means hurry up, you know, go fast.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:09.083
Oh, okay, okay.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.729
Hustle?

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.683
All right, boys, let's go. Double time.

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.888
Here we are. Day one of training at USC.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:22.124
- Hey, hey. Look at the boys.
- Sorry, sorry.

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.531
We're gonna be
a little late, but that's okay.

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.086
You guys are gonna
come here from 9:00 to 1:00 every day

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.367
and work with Coach House
and the USC team, got it?

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:36.202
JB likes to hustle.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:39.085
All right. Here we go.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.526
Not bad, huh?

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:47.209
It's absolutely beautiful, JB sir.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.164
Soak it in.

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:58.845
And now let's go. We're late. Let's go!

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.644
You must be the boys from India.

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.801
Welcome to America.

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:06.087
I'm Tom House. I'll be your coach.

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:07.610
This is my assistant, Doug.

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:11.648
Still working on their English.

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:14.007
Tell them,
I thought today we'd just run a few drills

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.480
and have some fun. What do you say?

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.202
The boys are gonna
blow you away, Tom, I promise.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.646
What is this?

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:27.965
I think it's used to
keep our bowling hand warm.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:31.123
Tell the boys the glove
is for catching the ball!

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:39.766
Okay, now,
you're just gonna toss it back and forth.

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:42.850
Just nice and easy. Nice and easy.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.967
- Where have you been?
- Sorry, man.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.321
The twins,
they've been puking all morning.

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.289
- How's it going here?
- Uh...

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.724
He's asking,
is it necessary to wear the gloves?

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.084
That's a first.

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.131
All right, tell him
half-speed. We're just warming up.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.487
It's not about
throwing hard, it's about throwing right.

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:22.251
- Oh, oh, oh.
- It's all right. It's all right.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.842
Tell him to relax. Tell him to smile.

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.321
Wow.

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:48.451
- We might have to tweak that a little bit.
- Hmm.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:01.729
It was like they couldn't
even tie their shoes out there.

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:03.006
Thank God, Chang didn't see that.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.088
All right, okay, look.
What do you think, Tom?

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.924
They did everything I asked 'em to do.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.604
They didn't complain. They never quit.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.411
They're good athletes.

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:13.404
And more importantly, their arms work.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.040
Do you think
you can have them ready in six months?

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:20.168
Based on what I just saw,

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:22.961
probably not.

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:26.561
<i>Spencer asked me to move in with him.</i>

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.085
No way.

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.488
No way, Spencer.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:35.486
Spencer is a funny name.

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.085
Hey, guys.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.407
Are you guys
gonna take these or just stare at me?

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:56.043
Guys, come on. Guys, it's pizza.

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:57.366
All right, come on.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.171
Are you from Mars or what?
That's a pizza. You eat it.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.526
Sorry, brother.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.441
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:11.448
I've fallen in love with pizza.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:18.761
We're screwed.

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:24.609
JB is going to pack our bags
and send us home.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:27.047
Dinesh, don't worry so.

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.884
We can't master it in one day.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:35.888
Don't you miss home?

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.800
I do miss it.

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:44.926
But now we are in America.
We can do anything here.

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:48.042
You can even change your name to...

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.121
Spencer.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.325
I don't want to change my name.

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.728
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Where are you going?

01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:01.328
I'm going to the bathroom.
Don't worry, I'm not leaving you.

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.085
Oh!

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:12.325
- JB!
- Oh, crap.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.810
- Okay, boys, knock 'em dead.
- Okay, JB sir.

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.051
- Bye, JB sir.
- That's good.

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:29.000
Keep working
on the English. I'll see you later.

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:33.083
He's not staying to watch us today?

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.369
I guess not.

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.647
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I did. You didn't listen to me.

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:49.966
You were too busy bribing half of India.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.041
- I didn't have a choice.
- Then guess what?

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.804
We're out of money, JB.

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.690
And not to mention that Chang has
been calling me all morning.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.371
He wants a status update. What am I
supposed to do? Come clean?

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.522
No, no. Don't come clean.

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.802
- Never come clean.
- Seven Figures Management.

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:04.160
That's probably Chang right now.

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:08.244
Sure, um, hold on just one second.

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.401
JB, it's Popo.

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.765
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:14.810
Hey. What's up?

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:18.486
Really?

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:21.562
Stay right there. I'm leaving right now.

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:22.926
Okay. Bye.

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:26.444
Pope's not happy with Procorp,

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.920
so he wants to talk to me about it.

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:31.924
So I'm gonna go talk to him,
and then I'll call you guys later.

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:35.123
Yes! Yes!
If you can get Popo, we're back!

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.170
- Yeah.
- Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.321
Ow. Sorry.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.968
Okay, tell me, single to left.

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:45.806
No, no, no, no. English.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:47.765
Single to left. Come on.

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:51.206
Back third base.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.846
- Back up third base. Good.
- Back up third base.

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.969
- I'm hungry.
- JB sir is coming soon.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.327
Let's concentrate on work.
Tell me, single to left.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.443
I'm tired, I'm hungry
and JB is late.

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.766
No, no, no, English.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.448
- I'm hungry.
- Hold on. Hold on.

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:09.927
Hey, guys. Come on. Let's go.
I'm sorry I'm late. I had a meeting.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.041
Let's go. Let's go.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.365
So, we'll work with Popo
for couple of months

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:14.851
till he finds out we're the real deal.

01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:16.524
And then we get the contract.
Yeah, hold on.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.728
Guys, hustle up! Let's go!
We'll get pizza. Come on.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:19.881
Let's go.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.804
Pizza again? He's killing me.

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.842
I don't care. I like pizza.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:32.005
Morning, Rinku. Morning, Dinesh.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.126
Oh!

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:30.167
So today's my day off,

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:32.160
so that means I absolutely
have to clean my house.

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:35.170
Boring. Uh...

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:38.249
So what about you guys?
How's the baseball going?

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.850
- Is that music?
- Yeah. This is my iPod.

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.566
For when I run.
What kind of music do you guys like?

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.326
I... I like...

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.042
- Keith... Keith Urban.
- Keith...

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.649
- What?
- Keith Urban.

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:56.010
Keith Urban? Wow. I did not
expect you to say that.

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.731
I... I like Eminem.
Eminem is good, you know?

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:01.246
Eminem? That's literally
what I'm listening to now. Here.

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:02.924
- I can see?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:04.881
Ready?

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:11.008
So, come on, how's the baseball
going? it looks awesome.

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:13.207
- It's not good.
- Really?

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:16.250
Baseball is very hard.

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.724
JB sir don't like the way we play.

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:20.171
Why do you say that? Why?

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:24.087
He don't... He don't come to watch.

01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:27.960
You see,
that's just 'cause he's a busy guy.

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.161
I don't think it's 'cause
he doesn't want to.

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:30.241
- Hey guys,

01:09:30.279 --> 01:09:31.840
come on, let's go. We're gonna be late.

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:34.765
- Hi, Brenda.
- Hi. Have a good day.

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:40.651
Keith Urban. Hmm.

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:44.120
One of the kids, Manny,
called Rinku a name.

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:47.443
Dinesh didn't like it. So, he shoved
him. And they tussled a bit.

01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:49.767
- What did he call him?
- That's not the point.

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:53.403
The point is, these boys aren't
gelling. They're struggling.

01:09:54.279 --> 01:09:55.930
And if you were here more,
you'd see that.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.200
Tom, I'd love to be here more.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.964
Work has been crazy.
You know what I do.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.606
Look, a big part of
this training is up here.

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:05.606
These kids, they need to be
in the right head space.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.210
They need to feel supported.

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:11.321
They need to be having fun.
You understand that?

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:13.246
Yes, of course I do, Tom.

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:15.567
Yes, it makes sense. Thank you.

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:21.611
Yes, Rinku, the new phone is working.

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:24.644
Are you listening to Mr. Bernstein?

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:31.890
Yes, JB is a very nice man,
and he is taking good care of us.

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:32.961
Hey-

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:36.968
Okay, as soon as Rinku gets off the
phone, we're going out.

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.202
- We're gonna have some fun.
- Okay, JB sir.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:44.488
Everyone is thinking of you.
We are all so excited.

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:49.405
I think of you a lot.

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:52.680
I miss you.

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:57.684
I have to go to work.

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.563
- Is this a hotel?
- No. This is your future.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.606
And hopefully mine,
if things go well tonight.

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.085
Not bad, huh?

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.726
- JB! My man.
- There he is.

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:23.051
- How you feeling?
- Good.

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.565
Boys, this is Popo Vanuatu,

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:26.608
one of the greatest
linebackers in the NFL.

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:29.366
- What's up, dude?
- Food and drink is that way.

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:31.084
But I'm gonna steal my man
JB here and talk business.

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:35.210
Okay, yeah, cool.
Guys, just hang tight. I'll be right back.

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:37.004
Have fun. Have fun.

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:43.204
Hey, Popo.
What are the Procorp boys doing here?

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:46.449
It's a party, JB.
They came. Don't sweat that.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:03.169
This is my special place, man.

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.562
Only for my nearest and dearest.

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:12.811
I'm honored, bro.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:25.402
We have practice tomorrow.
Should we leave now?

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:26.720
I think I ate too much.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:27.761
I told you not to!

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:30.081
You're eating cow, lamb, pig
and who knows what else.

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:33.920
I'm bored.
I eat when I'm bored.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:35.280
Hello, brother!

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:38.762
This is a crazy party, man!
Let's enjoy it, man!

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:40.763
Let's do some noise! Like this!

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:46.440
And then my grandpapa
would just look at me,

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.050
and he had these
crazy bushy eyebrows.

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.121
But it was real, you know?

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:53.601
Yeah. Yes, I do.

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.600
And then he looked at me and he said,

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.931
"Go be, Popo." Just like that.

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.768
"Go be."

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:08.131
Wow. That is, that is deep.

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:12.649
I'm so sorry.
I have to take this. It's the boys.

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.290
Hey. What's up, Amit?

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:17.401
What?

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:23.570
Why did you drink the punch
if you don't drink alcohol?

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.847
I didn't know it was alcohol, JB sir.

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:28.290
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:32.450
JB sir, can you slow it down, please?

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:35.563
- I'm not feeling very good.
- That's too bad.

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:37.170
I was in the middle of
something very important.

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:39.163
And for the record,
I don't care that you drank alcohol.

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:41.680
I just care that you then decided to go
swimming in someones fountain.

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.840
- I don't feel too good, JB sir.
- Did you drink, too?

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:47.124
- I ate too much.
- Well, I'm not slowing down.

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:49.128
I've gotta get back to that party.

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.446
JB sir,

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:52.846
I think I'm going to...

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:54.166
No, no, don't you dare!

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:55.401
Do not... No!

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.091
That's better.

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:07.929
Could we have some water?

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:11.885
Thanks. Sorry.

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:28.888
- There we go. Congrats.
- Thank you.

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.405
What's going on here?

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.641
JB.

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:38.851
This is just business.

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:00.921
Go to bed.

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.246
- I am sorry, JB sir.
- What?

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:05.886
- Sorry.
- You're sorry?

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:10.927
You're sorry that
I just lost my biggest client in years

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:13.770
because you guys decided
to wander off and trespass

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:16.286
on someone's
private property, swim in their fountain

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:19.051
and, oh, yeah, oh, yeah,
puke on me, twice!

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:22.051
Shush! You can translate it later.

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:25.450
How about instead of being sorry,

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.682
you guys do what you were
brought here to do,

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:29.250
which is learn the game?

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:31.441
Which, according to Mr. House,

01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:33.528
you're not even close to doing that.

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:35.880
So go to bed.

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:39.281
And no more TV. Ever.

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:01.327
Are you okay?

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.527
Yes.

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:12.446
Had a bad night.

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:14.606
Yeah, I see that.

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:20.160
Do you want a beer?

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.160
I don't know how much
longer I can do this.

01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:28.765
I was supposed to run a contest,

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:30.683
not become a primary caregiver.

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:33.605
My house is a mess, the pool is filthy,

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:35.170
my car smells like puke.

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:39.123
I'm late to everything.
I can't even spell sex.

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:40.520
You sound like every one
of my married friends.

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:43.604
But I'm not married.
I don't wanna be married.

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:45.524
All right, Mr. Sensitive.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.331
I think you just
need to accept the fact that

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:49.850
your life's gonna
be different for a couple of months.

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:51.245
And then it's gonna go back
to your old life.

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:53.561
Yeah, but there may not be
an old life to go back to

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:56.371
if this doesn't work out.
That's what you don't understand.

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:58.880
This thing, these kids...

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.048
This is my last best shot.

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:04.804
Come on. You got your big house,

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:06.086
your fancy car. You're gonna be fine.

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:09.687
No, I am miles away from fine.

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:13.122
All this stuff is
from my old life, when I made money,

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:16.807
before I stupidly decided
to go out on my own.

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:19.724
I can barely pay my bills.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:21.641
- Really?
- Really.

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:25.326
Sorry.

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:29.364
Okay, so if they're your last shot,

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.046
then don't you think
you should be paying

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.320
a little more attention to 'em?

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:36.201
I mean, it's not like
it's easy for these guys, you know.

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:38.607
They're far from home.
They miss their families.

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:40.840
- How do you know all this?
- 'Cause they told me.

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:42.120
You talk to them?

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:43.486
Yeah, I talk to them.

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:48.408
They just need to see that you care.

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.449
Yeah, maybe I need to create a...

01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.842
Create a better environment
for their success.

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.044
Something like that, yeah.

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:09.650
You just need to commit
to it and then you'll figure out the rest.

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:14.963
Speaking of committing, how is Mike?

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:17.165
- Mark.
- Mark.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.001
We broke up.

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.406
To committing.

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.126
To committing.

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:35.965
How we doing?

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.286
Amit, Amit, Amit.

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:50.607
Five. All right, and again. Cross it over.

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:16.041
That's a lot.

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:52.889
<i>Today I consider myself</i>

01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:55.725
<i>the luckiest man</i>

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.690
<i>on the face of the Earth.</i>

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:05.371
This is the saddest
movie I've ever seen.

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:09.530
How are you not crying right now?

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.048
I cried the first 35 times I watched it.

01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:15.441
Right.

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.325
Oh, boy, these guys are...

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:25.207
They're wiped. They're done.

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:27.330
They've been working very hard.

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:31.762
- Where's Amit?
- He's compiling his notes.

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:34.760
He wants to coach baseball.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.764
Either that or he's starting
an outsource center.

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:40.610
I can't determine which. There's a lot of
activity happening in that room.

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:41.971
- Stop.
- It's a great idea.

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:44.805
It's the first in-country outsource center.

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:46.604
That is hilarious.

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:48.081
Shh.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.923
You shh. You shh.

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:57.971
Do you... Do you wanna get a drink?

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.449
Come on in.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:04.566
All right, so this should impress you.

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:07.769
- Wow.
- Yeah. No, I know.

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:09.606
I know. It's a bit messy.

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:12.371
I just have not a lot of time to organize

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:14.442
because I'm either going to the hospital

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:16.443
or I'm coming back
from running or yoga.

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:18.648
Hey, The Taj has
some prime real estate.

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.130
Yeah, I love my mini Taj.

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:22.807
Scotch okay?

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:24.641
Fine.

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:25.921
Great.

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:30.284
Who are these fine ladies?

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:31.651
Oh, those are my sisters.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.529
- Yeah, I've got five.
- Five?

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.523
- Yeah.
- Wow. I didn't know that.

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:40.040
Well, before India,
we never really talked, you know.

01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:42.321
Yeah, why is that?

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:46.523
Well, I don't wanna offend you,

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:48.840
but I just never was really
interested in talking to you.

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:51.810
I am offended.

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:53.331
Don't be.

01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:58.328
You're just... You're just
different than you were before.

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:01.286
I don't feel different.

01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:03.400
Really? 'Cause your Porsche
looks like a minivan.

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:05.846
Minivans are the new black.

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:10.004
See? It's good. This whole

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:11.883
alternative family thing

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:13.007
looks good on you.

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:14.684
I mean, it's changed you.

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:16.041
How has it changed me?

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:21.086
I don't wanna ruin it.
I'm having too much fun watching.

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:24.004
Come on, tell me.
Tell me how it's changed me.

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:30.685
Well, that was more than just watching.

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.171
Yes, it was.

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:49.924
Good morning, Mr. JB sir.

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:54.722
Very good morning, Mr. JB sir.

01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:56.526
Hello.

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:58.210
Leaving in 20 minutes, guys.

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:08.369
All right, go ahead.

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:10.045
Say it.

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:14.406
Sir, we need to know

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:16.084
when you're going to marry Ms. Brenda.

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.486
- Yes.
- No, guys.

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.528
This is not what you ask in America.

01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:21.127
What do you ask?

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:24.606
You would say,
"How far did you get with Ms. Brenda?"

01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:25.846
You traveled with her?

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:27.410
No, no, no, it's not a distance.

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:29.124
It's, like,
physically, like, "Did you kiss her?"

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:30.611
- Like...
- Huh?

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:32.646
But that's private, no, sir?

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:34.688
Yes, it is private. Thank you.

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:36.928
I think you should marry Ms. Brenda.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.411
Even I also think.

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:40.369
Yes, sir. You are old.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.729
You should marry her, start family...

01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.410
Number one, lam not old.

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:45.805
You're a little bit old.

01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.204
Hey. Number two,

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:50.284
just because I've slept over at her house

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:51.446
doesn't mean I have to marry her.

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:52.521
Mmm...

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.125
Did you kiss Ms. Brenda?

01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:01.281
No.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.405
- She kissed me.
- Oh!

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:07.801
Oh, JB sir!

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:10.121
Oh, my God!

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.211
Yeah, well, enjoy the game, Mike,

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.641
and I'll have Aash
follow up with you on that.

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:20.970
You got it, pal. Bye.

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:22.966
JB, it's Chang.

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:24.121
Tell him I'm not here.

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:28.163
He's pushing for a tryout
and we need to stall, stall, stall.

01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:30.009
That might be tricky.

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:39.651
Their progress has been...

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:42.527
Remarkable.
- Yeah. Yep. Amazing.

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:46.883
By my calendar, we should hold the
tryout in three weeks, right?

01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:48.846
Uh, Well,

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.884
you know, to be honest,

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:53.930
even given their remarkable progress,

01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:57.729
they could probably use
a little more time.

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:01.851
We could all benefit
from more time, Mr. Bernstein,

01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:03.963
but it wasn't our agreement, was it?

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:06.121
No.

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:11.326
So are you gonna honor
our agreement or not?

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:14.127
Absolutely.

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:17.609
They will be ready in three weeks.

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.045
Excellent.

01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:23.920
Horse crap! We had a deal.
We were gonna do this right.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.924
We are! This way
we get maximum exposure.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.209
<i>ESPN, Sports Illustrated,
NBC, ABC, they're</i> all gonna <i>be there.</i>

01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:32.288
I mean right by Rinku and Dinesh.

01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:33.891
They're not ready
for this kind of pressure.

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:36.400
Tom, every scout
in the Major Leagues will be in Tempe

01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:38.044
- for the November meetings.
- Well, that's my point.

01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:40.000
Taking them to Tempe,
out of their comfort zone?

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:42.048
Putting them in front of a media circus?

01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:43.886
They'll be a sideshow.

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:48.802
I appreciate your input, Tom,

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:50.161
but this is business.

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:51.931
I have a deal with my investors

01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:54.884
and I have to live up
to that deal. That's what I do.

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.087
You understand?

01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:58.765
Perfectly.

01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:04.204
Oh! Can't use ASU's field.
Too many liabilities.

01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:06.328
Why are we hearing
about this right now, three days out?

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:08.164
Hey! They told me it would work.

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:10.045
It's fine. We can find another place.

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.401
All we need is a mound
and a cage. It's easy.

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:13.681
- Theresa?
- Yeah?

01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:15.762
Where are we with the scout RSVPs?

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:19.811
We are up to 24!

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:21.081
There we go.

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:22.161
- That's what I'm talking about.
- It's good.

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:23.645
Twenty-four is good.

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.643
Hey. What's up, Brenda?

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.126
What?

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:35.970
- Hey.
- Don't keep touching.

01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:37.929
- What the hell happened?
- It's not that bad.

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:40.440
Yeah, it's fine. He has two stitches.

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:41.920
He's gonna live. The doctor said...

01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.291
It's on his pitching hand.

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:44.807
How did this happen?

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:47.850
Oh, um, well, I was just teaching
them how to make Mexican food

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:51.049
and he was slicing a bell
pepper and he slipped and...

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:52.451
- It's fine.
- Okay...

01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:53.811
I need to talk to you outside, please.

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:54.967
It's honestly okay.

01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:56.889
I need to talk to
you outside for one minute.

01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:58.920
- He will be fine.
- Amit, turn the camera off.

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:01.247
- We're in a hospital.
- Sorry.

01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:04.329
- Sorry, JB sir.
- No, don't be sorry. We're fine.

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:05.691
Let me just... Hang on.

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.448
- Hey. What...
- Hey.

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:22.283
Look, I appreciate
all the stuff you were trying to do.

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:24.203
- But those guys are my investment.
- Okay.

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:26.442
I have a lot riding on their success.

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:27.641
Obviously it was an accident.

01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:30.690
I understand that. That accident
might cost me a lot of money.

01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:32.125
If he can't pitch in three days.

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:34.083
Okay, okay.
Well, I don't know how it works,

01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:35.366
but can't you push the tryout, or...

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.521
You want me to push the tryout?

01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:38.841
<i>You want me to</i> call <i>ESPN
and Sports Illustrated</i>

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:41.844
and half the world's media and
24-some-odd baseball clubs and go,

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:44.201
"Guys, sorry,
we can't do it in a couple of days,

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:45.401
"we're gonna need
to do it in a couple of weeks,

01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:48.404
"'cause one of my kids
wanted to learn how to make fajitas."

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:50.280
Is that what
you want me to do? You're insane!

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:52.530
Okay.

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:53.641
I don't think I'm being unreasonable.

01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:55.364
You're being a little unreasonable.

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.841
But you're also being a class-A jerk.

01:27:57.880 --> 01:27:59.962
I mean, I understand
they're your investments and everything,

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.804
but they're also just a couple of kids.

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:04.162
"Kids" being the operative word.

01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:16.687
Well, Sl is thinking of
doing a cover story,

01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:18.722
if all goes well.

01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:30.089
No, no. No, ESPN still wants
to do a feature

01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:33.209
for Outside the Lines.
Yeah, I just talked to the guy today.

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:43.448
Hey. Hey, guys-

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:45.721
Hey.

01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:49.371
All right, I just wanted to

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.323
wish you guys all the best.

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:54.889
I know you're gonna get out there and
you're gonna blow them away.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.401
Truly. All right, let's hug it out.

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:00.526
This is what we do. This is how we do it.

01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.247
- Thank you, Ms. Brenda.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:05.810
- Good luck.
- Thank you, madam.

01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:08.360
Okay, then I wanna
hear all about it when you get back.

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:09.971
Hey! Come on, guys. Let's load it up.

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:11.246
- Bye.
- Good luck.

01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:13.442
We gotta go. Hey, hey, hey.
Can I talk to you for a second?

01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:14.885
Yeah. What's up?

01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:16.604
I just wanted to apologize
for the other day, you know.

01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:17.761
Oh!

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:18.961
I've been under a lot of...

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:23.408
I've been under a lot of
pressure with all this

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:25.080
and I did not need to take it out on you.

01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:27.521
Oh, I'm a big girl, JB.
I can handle you getting mad.

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.720
I just don't like seeing
that side of you, that's all.

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:32.201
What side is that?

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:34.685
I don't know. The side that puts the deal

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:37.127
before everything else, I guess.

01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:42.251
Well, maybe that's just who I am.

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:44.290
Maybe. I hope not.

01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:47.410
Safe travels.

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:48.921
Knock 'em dead.

01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:56.042
It should be fine.
It shouldn't affect your cutter.

01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:58.651
Sir, I don't have a cutter.

01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:00.321
See?

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:05.171
Sir, do you think we're ready?

01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:13.160
Doesn't matter what I think,
or anyone else.

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:15.208
It only matters what you think.

01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:17.166
You understand?

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:36.921
Here you go.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.161
Shouldn't this be ready already?

01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:40.000
It's getting there. It's
getting there, okay?

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:42.364
Oh, Chang's here.

01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:45.762
Think he's wondering
why we're doing this in a strip mall?

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:46.887
I don't know. I'll tell you what,

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:48.769
do not talk to House about this, okay?

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:50.245
He is not happy.

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:53.729
Well, too bad.

01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:56.324
Showtime, buddy.

01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:57.811
Let's do this, partner. Boom.

01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:02.488
- Are you nervous?
- Uh, no.

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:05.486
Well, you shouldn't be,
because all of India is behind you.

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:08.370
<i>- We will all be watching live.
- All?</i>

01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:09.720
<i>Yes, this feed will be seen...</i>

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:10.881
Yes!

01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:12.604
...by <i>nearly half</i> a <i>billion people.</i>

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:14.887
<i>And we know you'll
make India so proud.</i>

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:16.968
<i>- Thank you. Good luck.</i>

01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:29.527
Okay, thank you, guys,
all for coming out.

01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:31.403
Uh, believe it or not, 10 months ago,

01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:34.250
these two guys
had never even heard of baseball,

01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:37.204
much less picked one up
and tried to throw it.

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:39.288
Uh, so, I'm pretty sure
you're gonna be blown away

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:40.521
by what you see today.

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:45.050
Uh, anyway, without further ado,
please welcome India's finest.

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:48.331
First up, Dinesh Kumar Patel.

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.528
- Let's go. Come on, buddy.
- Yeah! Whoo!

01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:58.842
- What's wrong?
- Sir, mound no good, sir.

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:02.168
- What do you mean?
- Um... Sir, no rubber, sir.

01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:05.327
Don't worry
about that, okay? You got this.

01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:07.801
I want you to just relax
and throw your stuff, all right?

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.080
Relax and throw your stuff.

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:12.129
Right in there, all right?

01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:10.848
They were all over the place, JB.

01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:12.888
Yeah, but Pete, you gotta see
the potential here.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.688
Potential? Maybe from
a marketing perspective. Maybe.

01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:18.926
But this is Major League Baseball.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.002
This isn't some social experiment.

01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:23.084
I'm sorry.
They're not for the Mariners.

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:27.762
- You're gonna regret this, Pete.
- Sorry.

01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:30.281
Mr. Bernstein.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.365
Mr. Chang, hey.

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:34.880
Listen, they're a lot better than that.

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:36.604
I don't know what happened out there.

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:38.011
Congratulations.

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.041
I'm sorry?

01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:42.765
You said one year
to a Major League tryout.

01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:44.922
- You did it.
- Yeah, but...

01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:48.760
Look, I'm satisfied.
I will extend our deal to three years.

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:51.006
With all this attention,

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:52.884
<i>it can only help The Million Dollar Arm</i>

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:55.161
be more visible in the future.

01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:56.960
These boys are done,
but there'll be others.

01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:58.801
Good day.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.764
Well, you got your deal.

01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:07.687
Maybe you can
take the boys out and celebrate.

01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:31.884
At least we get to see our families soon,
right?

01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:42.169
On the surface, guys,
this sounded like such a promising idea,

01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:43.651
and they even showed

01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:45.887
<i>some flashes of real brilliance.</i>

01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:48.042
<i>But in the end, I gotta
believe, at least right now,</i>

01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:50.566
<i>their chances of getting signed
by a Major League club</i>

01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:53.684
<i>fall between slim and none.</i>

01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:56.007
<i>More on how they
thought they did. Here's Steve Levy.</i>

01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:59.086
<i>Rinku, let's start with you. After the
way you pitched today,</i>

01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:01.120
<i>do you feel like
it was good enough to get signed?</i>

01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:04.321
<i>No, sir.</i>

01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:07.003
<i>Dinesh, what about you?</i>

01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:09.128
<i>No, sir. We did not pitch good.</i>

01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:12.088
<i>Hang in there, fellas.
Better times ahead.</i>

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:13.565
<i>Back to you in the studio.</i>

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.683
<i>Look, this is a good idea.</i>

01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:18.166
<i>Someone from India is going
to pitch in the big leagues,</i>

01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:21.761
<i>but, Schill, not these guys
and certainly not right now.</i>

01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:23.683
<i>This felt like
a huge publicity stunt to me.</i>

01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:25.882
<i>I mean, these guys are
not ready for a pro tryout.</i>

01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:27.649
<i>They're throwing the ball
all over the place.</i>

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:29.205
<i>When you think about it,
who can blame them?</i>

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:31.123
<i>There's scouts,
there's media everywhere...</i>

01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:43.565
You were right.

01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:45.881
God. <i>I</i> did not...

01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:47.846
I did not see you there.

01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:50.611
Uh... Um, what was I right about?

01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:53.321
I'm a jerk.

01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:57.724
I've been one for a while now.

01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:00.241
Maybe my whole life.

01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:04.691
Um, yeah, I heard about today. I'm sorry.

01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:07.130
How did you hear? SportsCenter?

01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:09.402
No. Rinku texted me.

01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:14.081
- What did he say?
- "We failed."

01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:19.843
I feel like I gave them this dream,

01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:23.447
and then just took it away from them.

01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:25.967
So give it back to them,
you know. Do another tryout.

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:27.246
That's impossible.

01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:30.165
The only reason I got this tryout

01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:31.930
was because people were curious.

01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:34.445
It was a stunt.

01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:37.444
Well, then maybe
it is impossible. Maybe you're right,

01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:39.000
but, then again, so was going to India

01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:40.241
and pulling two kids out of the sticks

01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:42.520
and turning them
into baseball players. So, I don't know.

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:46.443
Good night, JB.
Gotta go to bed.

01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:16.810
I don't understand.

01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:19.651
I need to have another tryout.

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:22.001
- You will, next year.
- No, I need to have another tryout

01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:23.881
with Rinku and Dinesh.

01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:25.800
I need to give them a real shot.

01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:27.445
I cannot allow this.

01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:31.006
Your boys failed, yes,
but the contest did not.

01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:33.162
If it doesn't work,
it will ruin our relationship

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:35.322
with Major League Baseball
and the scouts.

01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:38.683
It will jeopardize
the future of our investment.

01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:44.206
I'm sorry.
I have to do this, Mr. Chang.

01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:48.483
If you do this,
you do it without my support

01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:50.648
and without my future commitment.

01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:57.526
I understand.

01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:02.490
Good day, gentlemen.

01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:11.527
And for the record, Mr. Chang,

01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:13.601
my boys didn't fail.

01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:15.601
I did.

01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:24.250
Now you come clean.

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:26.561
JB Bernstein's office
calling for Mr. Epstein.

01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:28.205
I know we already did this one time.

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:29.890
Yeah, we're gonna do it again.

01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:32.044
Because they choked, all right?

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:36.250
Yes, hey. How are you?
No, I don't wanna talk about Tempe.

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:37.560
Don't talk to me about Tempe.

01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:39.847
Tempe's...
Forget about Tempe, all right?

01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:41.325
That is not... No, we are
gonna do this again.

01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:42.447
You had to see the potential.

01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:45.683
Hi. This is Theresa calling
from JB Bernstein's office

01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:47.563
for Mr. Rodriguez.

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:48.647
Yep, it's JB Bernstein.

01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:50.245
Why are you giving me
hard time? You wanna be there.

01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:53.244
How about a billion new fans, with a "B"?

01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:55.363
Great. Well, thank you.

01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:57.411
Okay. Bye-bye-

01:39:58.200 --> 01:39:59.929
Is anyone coming back?

01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:03.442
We got one "maybe."

01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:06.164
But 15 noes.

01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:08.846
And I'm tapped.
I mean, I don't know what else to do, JB.

01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:13.130
I do. Come on.

01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:16.328
Keep working the phones.

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:19.324
We just need one. The rest'll follow.

01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:21.562
- Where are you going?
- Tempe.

01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:51.521
Did we get any calls?

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:53.250
No, no, me either.

01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:55.647
Striking out left, right and center.

01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:58.807
All right, well, let me know
if you hear anything.

01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:01.042
Yeah, fine. Bye.

01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:11.567
- What the hell?
- That's agent for "hello," isn't it?

01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:13.688
Hello, Ray.
What are you doing here?

01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:15.120
What am I doing here?
I live here.

01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:17.089
Every scout in the country lives here.

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:18.889
Don't you know anything
about baseball?

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.047
Apparently I don't.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.446
You know, you should have listened to
House when I told you to.

01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:25.005
Now everybody's looking like a moron.

01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:27.162
All right, I'm sorry. I messed up, Ray.

01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:29.567
You know what?
I don't have time for this.

01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:31.768
What are you doing?

01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:34.161
- Start the car.
- Why? Where are we going?

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:36.561
Start the car! Head east.

01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:49.090
This is the best Chinese chicken salad

01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:50.650
in the continental United States.

01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:52.610
And the chef isn't even Chinese.

01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:55.210
Here. Taste a little bit of that.

01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:57.851
- I don't want any.
- Well, you gotta try it.

01:41:57.880 --> 01:41:59.530
Ray, come on, I don't want any.

01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:01.250
- Just have a taste.
- I don't wanna taste it.

01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:04.051
Look how he blends the lime juice

01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:06.088
with the toasted sesame oil

01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:08.168
and the crunchiness
of the chicken. It's really spectacular.

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:10.043
Ray, look.
I'm running out of time here.

01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:12.761
- What are we doing?
- Take it easy for a minute.

01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:14.924
- Walter!
- Hey!

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.923
- How you doing?
- I'm good, Ray. How are you?

01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:19.200
- Don't you eat anywhere else?
- Never. Absolutely not.

01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:20.770
- Say hello to Mr. Bernstein.
- Hi.

01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:22.769
- How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
- Nice to meet you.

01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:23.881
So how was Puerto Rico?

01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:26.048
I was there for three weeks.

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:27.287
I'll tell you about it later.

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:29.402
Yeah, I'd like to hear
about it. Sit down, sit down for a minute.

01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:31.562
- Join us for a minute.
- Come on, Ray, I should get going.

01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:33.881
Just for a minute. Take it easy. Sit down.

01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:37.925
You don't know this guy?

01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:40.723
No, I don't know this guy.

01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:42.810
- You don't know Walter?
- I don't know Walter.

01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:44.564
You don't know Walter Shapiro?

01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:48.048
The head scout for the Pirates

01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:52.085
who was not here for your exhibition.

01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:55.886
Oh, Walter Shapiro.

01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:58.400
- Yes!
- Oh, hi.

01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:02.445
And now you know him
and he doesn't know you.

01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:04.440
What a stroke of luck.

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:07.090
Thanks for lunch.

01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:11.406
Thank you, Ray.

01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:17.046
Hello?

01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:20.091
Hey! Hello?

01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:28.001
Amit?

01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:42.687
What the hell?

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:09.330
- Welcome to India, JB sir.
- What's this?

01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:11.091
Please have a seat for your date.

01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:13.681
My date?

01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:17.241
Ms. Brenda.

01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:34.441
Wow.

01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:42.440
That is a very,
very nice look on you, Ms. Brenda.

01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:44.887
Why, thank you, Mr. JB sir.

01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:46.481
Madam.

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:49.360
- Please, sir.
- Today we have some delicious

01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:52.045
lamb tikka masala,

01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:55.368
uh, some vegetable curry, here...

01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:59.049
...rice, and some naan and poppadum.

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:00.720
Where did all this come from?

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.047
They cooked it.

01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:04.080
Hold on a minute,
you guys know how to cook?

01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:05.971
Yes, JB sir. Little bit.

01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:07.041
But...

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.411
Ms. Brenda did all the cutting.

01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:11.131
- That's true.
- Good.

01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:12.280
I made sure of it.

01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:16.007
We are trying to
thank you with this meal.

01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:19.567
And we also wanted to say

01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:21.324
that we are very, very sorry, sir,

01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:25.209
because we are letting
you down at the tryouts.

01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:28.047
We can never repay
what you've given us, JB sir.

01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:29.930
Repay me? Guys, come on.

01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:31.241
What are you talking about?

01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:34.762
Okay, we all are here together,

01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:37.610
so let's thank God and let's do a prayer.

01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:39.081
Okay.

01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:52.525
- Sorry.
- JB.

01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:53.840
I have to take this. It's Aash.

01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:55.331
- Really? Now?
- I'm sorry.

01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:56.521
- Hey.
- JB sir...

01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:00.286
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm in the middle of a

01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:02.361
prayer right now.

01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:04.608
But, uh, I wanted to let you know

01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:07.041
we got the second tryout from MLB.

01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:10.127
Yeah, it's gonna be
in two weeks at USC.

01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:13.245
So get ready. All right, I'll
call you later and fill you in.

01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:16.322
Yeah, bye. Sorry. Where were you?

01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:17.640
We were praying?

01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:20.246
Are you messing with us, dude?

01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:22.442
No, I'm not messing with you.
You got a second tryout.

01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:23.965
All right. So start stretching.

01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:27.769
Whoo! Whoo!

01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:29.930
But this time,
we're gonna do it a little different.

01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:31.007
Yes. We're gonna pitch good.

01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:32.280
Ideally you will pitch better,

01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:34.448
yes, but this time, guys, I...

01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:36.606
I just want you to have fun.

01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:38.410
- Yes, sir.
- Okay?

01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:42.168
Last time we did this,
it was all business and that was my fault.

01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:50.249
But baseball shouldn't be
just about business, okay?

01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:53.331
You should have fun.

01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:57.960
How are you not writing this down?

01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:01.770
Oh, yes,
I need to write that. Noted, JB sir.

01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:04.127
And listen to me, guys,
no matter what happens,

01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:07.721
I want you to know
that you could never, ever

01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:09.521
let me down.

01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:12.167
Okay? I have never been more proud

01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:13.924
of anyone in my entire life.

01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:16.931
So I wanna thank you.

01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:21.605
I really love you guys.

01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:33.727
I'm hungry-

01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:39.680
- We should eat.
- We should. Beautiful food.

01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:42.200
Ms. Brenda, would you mind if
they joined us on our date?

01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:44.051
I wouldn't have it any other way.

01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:45.730
- Get some chairs, guys.
- No, no, no...

01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:48.811
Amit, Amit, pull up a chair.
Come on, it's fine.

01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:51.929
Sir, Indian food...
Indian food is the best food, sir.

01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:54.691
- Wait. Wait. Take your plate.
- I'll try everything.

01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:52.447
Not as many as last time.

01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:54.209
Who cares? There's enough.

01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:57.240
Well, this is a little more like it.

01:48:57.640 --> 01:48:59.688
- Hello, Ray, Tom.
- JB.

01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:03.250
Good job getting this together.

01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:04.441
It couldn't have been easy.

01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:05.970
It was highly improbable.

01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:08.407
But we managed to do it.

01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:10.006
I should've listened to you the first time.

01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:11.406
Oh, you think?

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:16.489
- Sorry about that.
- Forget it. Live and learn.

01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:18.124
- You nervous?
- I can barely breathe.

01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:19.770
Well, then it's probably not the best time

01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:22.246
to let you know that Chang is here.

01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:24.288
- What? Really?
- Yeah. Five o'clock.

01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:30.686
I really don't feel good.

01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:33.047
Well, you're in luck.
Here comes the doctor.

01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:39.646
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:40.841
Hi. Wow. You made it.

01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:43.008
Of course.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:45.850
Are you kidding me? But I'm so nervous
right now, it's hard to breathe.

01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:48.201
- Yeah, I know. I have the same...
- Are you feeling that?

01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:52.842
I think I really like you, Ms. Brenda.

01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:56.966
I really like you, too, Mr. JB sir.

01:49:57.520 --> 01:49:58.800
Look, this is all very touching,

01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:01.366
but we have to get this show on the road.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.729
JB, you might wanna talk to your boys.

01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:05.848
They're looking a little shaky.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.241
No. You know what? I want Amit to do it.

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:10.767
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:13.286
You wanted to be a coach. Go coach.

01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:17.884
- Okay.
- No, no, no. Give me that. Give me that.

01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:18.961
Give me that.

01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:21.521
Go talk to 'em.

01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:23.371
Fire 'em up.

01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:34.245
<i>Go get 'em.</i>

01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:52.086
Ready?

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:09.081
All my life I wanted
to be a baseball player.

01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:15.170
It's a great sport.

01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:21.561
But I never dreamed it was possible.

01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:28.608
You, Rinku, you, Dinesh,

01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:31.449
you are baseball players now.

01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:33.531
Real baseball players.

01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:38.730
Now small boys in India,

01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:42.610
they can dream to become like you.

01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:48.442
So, let's go.

01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:51.448
Let's go and let's make

01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:55.441
JB, Ray, Brenda, Tom,

01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:58.251
our families, proud, huh?

01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:02.606
Are you with me?

01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:10.085
"India" on three.

01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:11.687
One,

01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:13.481
two,

01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:15.161
three.

01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:16.521
India!

01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:23.161
Hey, brothers,

01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:26.206
I'm seeing my dream in both of you.

01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:28.770
Your victory, my victory.

01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:30.406
Rock it, brother.

01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:48.406
Who knew?

01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:25.731
What's he doing now?

01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:29.326
He's having fun.

01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:15.245
- That sounds like...
- Juice!

01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:16.761
Ooh.

01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:22.121
Ninety-three.

01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:24.609
Yes! Yes!

01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:27.760
Yes!

01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:30.211
Yes, yes!

01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:02.161
Yes!

01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:18.886
What do you know
about Pittsburgh Pirates? Anything?

01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:21.690
Well, they're your new team.

01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:24.001
You now have been offered

01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:26.321
a contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates.
