04:25.932 --> 04:28.059
Simone: OK, LET'S
TALK ABOUT TOMMY.

04:31.312 --> 04:34.899
I'VE COME TO HAVE DOUBTS
WITH WHAT TOMMY'S DOING.

04:37.443 --> 04:40.822
DOUBTS IF, UH, HE MIGHT'VE
BEEN INVOLVED IN THE HOMICIDE?

04:43.449 --> 04:46.369
THAT'S A NUMBER HE DIALED
I'M UPSET ABOUT

04:46.452 --> 04:49.455
THAT I--I--I HEARD
A WOMAN'S VOICE.

04:49.497 --> 04:54.294
YOU HEARD A PHONE
CONVERSATION THAT TOMMY
WAS HAVING WITH THIS WOMAN?

04:54.377 --> 04:57.797
NO, THAT TOMMY HAD
A CONVERSATION, AND...

04:57.839 --> 05:01.551
I...PUSHED THE CALL
REDIAL AFTER.

05:01.634 --> 05:02.969
Russell:
AND A WOMAN ANSWERED.

05:04.387 --> 05:05.305

05:05.388 --> 05:08.057
I--I PUSHED
THE CALL REDIAL,

05:08.141 --> 05:10.727
AND THEN AFTER
HE SAW ME UPSET, HE--

05:10.810 --> 05:12.895
I'M SURE HE WENT OUT
AND CALLED HER.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.064
HE MUST'VE ASKED HER
IF SHE'D HAD A HANG-UP,

05:15.148 --> 05:17.525
AND SHE MUST'VE SAID
YES BECAUSE LIKE
10 MINUTES LATER

05:17.608 --> 05:20.653
HE CAME BACK
REALLY PISSED OFF--

05:20.737 --> 05:22.739

FINDING THINGS OUT

05:22.822 --> 05:25.992
TO BE SURE I WANTED TO

AND...

05:27.493 --> 05:30.747
WHAT DID HE MEAN BY
"THE CONSEQUENCES"?

05:30.830 --> 05:33.333
I DON'T KNOW.

05:33.374 --> 05:35.001
WAS HE THREATENING
TO HARM YOU?

05:47.013 --> 05:48.806
IF YOU TALK
TO THIS WOMAN,

05:48.848 --> 05:52.977
I--I JUST WONDERED
IF MAYBE YOU'D FORM
AN IMPRESSION OFF THAT.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.605
IF HE COULD'VE
KILLED DARLENE?

05:55.688 --> 05:58.191
I GUESS THAT OR...

05:58.274 --> 06:00.943
IF HE'S EXPECTING
TO HARM ME OR...

06:02.445 --> 06:04.280

WHAT TO DO.

06:20.713 --> 06:23.716

12:32.001 --> 12:32.918
NO.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.212
IT'S BETTER
THAN AN M.R.I.

12:35.254 --> 12:38.257
I'M PLENTY
UNCOMFORTABLE NOW,
I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.

12:38.340 --> 12:40.760
I WANT YOU TO SLIDE DOWN
FOR ME A LITTLE.

12:40.801 --> 12:42.094
THERE YOU GO.
NOW I'M GONNA ASK YOU

12:42.178 --> 12:44.597
TO PLACE YOUR HANDS
ABOVE YOUR HEAD.

12:44.638 --> 12:46.724
[GASPING] OOH.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.769
THE MACHINE'S GONNA VISUALIZE
YOUR ENTIRE ABDOMINAL AREA.

12:49.852 --> 12:53.272
THE TEST WILL TAKE AROUND
15 MINUTES, SO I'LL NEED
YOU TO LIE VERY STILL.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.940
THIS IS JUST TO HELP
KEEP YOU FROM MOVING.

12:54.982 --> 12:57.234
I'M SO UNCOMFORTABLE,
I WONDER IF I'M GONNA
BE ABLE TO DO THIS.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.652
JUST TRY TO RELAX.

12:58.736 --> 13:01.238
YEAH, BUT I WONDER IF I'M
GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THIS.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.199
Dr. Gupta:
HOW ARE YOU DOING,
MR. SIPOWICZ?

13:03.282 --> 13:05.075
LOUSY.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.577
HE'S FEELING
A LITTLE ANXIOUS.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.912
I'M FEELING LIKE
I CAN'T BREATHE.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.246
YOU DON'T WANT
A LITTLE VALIUM?

13:09.288 --> 13:10.623
WE CALL IT
THE MEDICAL BLINDFOLD.

13:10.664 --> 13:13.292
UH, LISTEN, UH,
I CAN'T DO THIS.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.418
I THINK I CAN'T DO THIS.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.920
MAYBE CLOSING YOUR EYES
WOULD HELP.

13:15.961 --> 13:19.590
I'M SO UNCOMFORTABLE.
I--I HAVE A HARD TIME
BREATHING.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.091
GET ME THE HELL
OUTTA THIS THING
HERE.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.927
OH, BOY.
GET ME THE HELL
OUTTA HERE,

13:22.968 --> 13:23.969
OR I'LL BREAK YOUR JAW.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.429
TRY TO CALM DOWN.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.056
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM,
MR. SIPOWICZ?

13:27.139 --> 13:29.433
SOMETHING'S SQUEEZING MY CHEST.
LET ME THE HELL OUTTA HERE.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.559
TAKE HIM OUT.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.770
SOMETHING'S
SQUEEZING IN MY CHEST,

13:32.812 --> 13:34.897
AND I CAN'T SWALLOW.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.775
YOUR FACE IS BLOTCHY.
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
HAVE ALLERGY?

13:37.817 --> 13:39.068
I DON'T KNOW.

13:39.151 --> 13:41.237
GET THE GURNEY AND
LET'S GET HIM UPSTAIRS.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.655
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

13:44.031 --> 13:46.992
ALL RIGHT, MR. SIPOWICZ,
WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU
UPSTAIRS,

13:47.034 --> 13:49.620
WHERE OTHER DOCTORS
CAN LOOK AT YOU.

13:49.662 --> 13:50.788
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

13:50.830 --> 13:52.456
LET'S TAKE HIM
RIGHT OVER TO C.C.U.

13:52.498 --> 13:53.791
ALSO LET'S NOTIFY
DR. TALBOT.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.293
DO YOU WANT ME TO STOP
AND CALL DR. TALBOT?

13:56.335 --> 13:57.837
NO. LET'S GET HIM
UP TO C.C.U.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.129
THIS HAPPENS
SOMETIMES, HUH?

13:59.171 --> 14:00.631
WHAT'S C.C.U.?

14:00.673 --> 14:02.508
IT'S FOR PEOPLE
WITH CHEST PAINS,
MR. SIPOWICZ.

14:02.591 --> 14:03.843
I'M A RADIOLOGIST.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.720
PERHAPS YOU NEED
A DIFFERENT KIND
OF DOCTOR NOW.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.514
HELLO, MS. SIPOWICZ.

14:13.352 --> 14:14.812
WE NEED A DOCTOR.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.690
PATIENT DEVELOPED
CHEST PAINS DURING
A C.A.T. SCAN.

14:17.731 --> 14:18.816
NO PREVIOUS
CARDIAC HISTORY.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.276
HOW ARE YOU
FEELING?

14:20.359 --> 14:21.485
MR. SIPOWICZ.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.320
HE CAN'T BREATHE.
HE HAS PAIN IN HIS CHEST.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.613
HE WAS VERY ANXIOUS
BEFORE THE TEST.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.031
ALSO, HE COULD BE
REACTING TO THE DYE.

14:26.073 --> 14:27.741
ARE YOU ALLERGIC
TO SHELLFISH,
MR. SIPOWICZ?

14:27.825 --> 14:29.034
HE'S NEVER
EATEN SHELLFISH.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.203
[GASPING] I DON'T
EAT SHELLFISH.

14:31.287 --> 14:34.373
CAN YOU DESCRIBE
WHAT YOU'RE FEELING
IN YOUR CHEST?

14:34.456 --> 14:35.875
IT-IT'S TIGHT
AND PRESSING.

14:35.916 --> 14:36.959
IT HURTS.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.252
IF ZERO WERE NO PAIN,

14:38.335 --> 14:39.628
AND 10 WERE THE WORST
PAIN YOU EVER FELT,

14:39.712 --> 14:40.754
WHAT NUMBER WOULD
YOU GIVE THE PAIN
IN YOUR CHEST?

14:40.838 --> 14:42.047
5.

14:42.089 --> 14:44.133
LET'S GET AN
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM
AND DRAW BLOODS.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.552
YOU'RE LUCKY
WE HAD A BED OPEN.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.888
ANY SPECIAL REASON
YOU DIDN'T TAKE HIM
TO THE ER?

14:48.971 --> 14:50.055
MR. SIPOWICZ, I'M
GONNA HOOK YOU UP

14:50.097 --> 14:51.599
SO WE CAN SEE HOW
YOUR HEART'S DOING.

14:51.682 --> 14:54.727
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
A BOLUS OF DECADRON,
MR. SIPOWICZ,

14:54.810 --> 14:56.020
JUST IN CASE YOU'RE
REACTING TO THE DYE.

14:56.061 --> 14:57.104
I'M ALSO
GONNA GIVE YOU
SOME MORPHINE

14:57.187 --> 14:58.314
TO HELP
GET YOUR PAIN
UNDER CONTROL.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.565
MY HUSBAND'S AN ADDICT.

14:59.607 --> 15:00.900
HE DOESN'T WANT
TO TAKE NARCOTICS.

15:00.941 --> 15:02.067
I UNDERSTAND
YOUR CONCERN.

15:02.109 --> 15:03.235
ONE DOSE UNDER
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES

15:03.277 --> 15:04.737
ISN'T GONNA
BE A TRIGGER.

15:04.778 --> 15:05.905
WE GOTTA GET YOUR PAIN
UNDER CONTROL,

15:05.946 --> 15:07.740
AND MORPHINE
IS PROPER MEDICINE.

15:07.781 --> 15:09.742
IT'S ALL RIGHT, ANDY.

15:09.825 --> 15:11.911
EXCUSE US FOR
A COUPLE MINUTES.

15:11.952 --> 15:13.871
THEN IT'D BE FINE
FOR YOU TO COME BACK.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.874
IS HE HAVING
A HEART ATTACK?

15:16.916 --> 15:18.542
A LOT OF THINGS
COULD BE GOING ON.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.086
WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL
WE'VE DONE SOME TESTS.

15:21.128 --> 15:23.088
PLEASE, WOULD YOU JUST
TAKE CARE OF HIM, DOCTOR?

15:23.130 --> 15:24.548
I WILL.

15:27.259 --> 15:28.594
THIS HAPPENS
SOMETIMES.

15:29.595 --> 15:30.888
Nurse: I KNOW
YOU'RE AFRAID.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.390
WE'RE GONNA TRY
AND GET YOU
FEELING BETTER.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.033
I'M JOSé AGUILAR.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.451
MY BROTHER
WAS FOUND DEAD.

15:52.534 --> 15:55.454
I'M DETECTIVE
KIRKENDALL, JOSé.

15:55.496 --> 15:58.582
I'M HELPING TO INVESTIGATE
YOUR BROTHER'S DEATH.

15:58.624 --> 16:02.586
THIS IS DETECTIVE MEDAVOY.
JOSé AGUILAR.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.755
HOW DO YOU DO?
I'M SORRY ABOUT
YOUR BROTHER.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.215
WHY DON'T WE
TALK OVER HERE.

16:07.925 --> 16:10.135
YOU WANT A REFRESHMENT
OF SOME SORT?

16:10.219 --> 16:12.262
HOW WAS IT HE DIED?

16:13.347 --> 16:15.849
YOUR BROTHER WAS
SHOT IN THE CHEST.

16:17.559 --> 16:19.436
WHAT WAS HE UP TO?

16:19.478 --> 16:22.606
WELL, IT'S NOT
COMPLETELY CLEAR.

16:22.648 --> 16:25.818
WHO CAN YOU THINK OF
HAD IT IN FOR HIM?

16:25.859 --> 16:27.319
MOST PEOPLE LIKED HIM.

16:27.403 --> 16:28.779
WE LOOKED UP
YOUR BROTHER'S RECORD.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.823
HE HAD ARRESTS
FOR POSSESSION,

16:30.864 --> 16:32.199
BURGLARY, AND ASSAULT.

16:32.282 --> 16:34.576
WAS HE STILL DOING
STUFF LIKE THAT?

16:34.660 --> 16:37.371
NO. THAT WAS
IN THE PAST.

16:37.454 --> 16:38.872
HE WASN'T INTO DRUGS?

16:42.584 --> 16:43.836
DID YOU SEE HIM TODAY?

16:43.877 --> 16:46.380
HE WAS LIVING
AT YOUR PLACE, WASN'T HE?

16:46.463 --> 16:48.966
YEAH, BUT HE DIDN'T
COME HOME LAST NIGHT.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.301
WHAT WAS GOING ON
IN HIS LIFE LATELY?

16:51.343 --> 16:53.262
NOT A WHOLE HELLUVA LOT.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.805
GOT HIMSELF FIRED
OFF A JOB AND NEVER
GOT ANOTHER ONE.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.182
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE WAS DOING.

16:57.224 --> 16:59.643
MOSTLY HANGING AROUND
WITH SOME LITTLE BITCH.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.186
BUT HE DUMPED HER
LAST WEEK.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.896
YOU KNOW THIS
LITTLE BITCH'S NAME?

17:02.980 --> 17:04.898
TERESA OCASIO.

17:04.982 --> 17:08.235
TERESA OCASIO, HUH?

17:08.318 --> 17:10.404
YEAH.
YOU RECOGNIZE HER?

17:10.487 --> 17:12.364
WE FOUND MIGUEL'S BODY
AT HER AND HER FATHER'S
APARTMENT.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.324
THAT'S WHERE
YOU FOUND HIM?

17:14.366 --> 17:15.743
YOU'RE SAYING
HE DUMPED HER.

17:15.826 --> 17:16.869
WOULD HE GO BACK
TO SEE HER?

17:16.952 --> 17:19.830
NO. HE COULDN'T
STAND HER ANYMORE.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.833
HE NEVER WANTED
TO SEE HER AGAIN.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.835
SHE TURNED OUT
TO BE A HEAD CASE.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.546
HE WAS IN THE TUB.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.717
LIKE HE'D BEEN
TAKING A BATH?

17:31.800 --> 17:33.385
NO. NO, HE WAS CLOTHED.

17:33.427 --> 17:35.888
SOMEONE HAD
DUMPED HIM THERE.

17:35.971 --> 17:39.183
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT'D BE ABOUT.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.935
NAH. UH, WE CAN'T
FIGURE IT OUT EITHER.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.029
2 DETECTIVES FOR
A NO LEFT TURN.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.156
NO WONDER
THE CRIME RATE'S DOWN.

17:54.239 --> 17:56.867
IT'S NOT MAKING YOUR
COURT APPEARANCE,
NADINE,

17:56.909 --> 17:58.202
THAT GETS
THE JUDGES CRANKY.

17:58.243 --> 17:59.703
I'M SUCH AN AIRHEAD.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.747
MY BOYFRIEND COULD HAVE
HELPED ME WITH THIS.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.791
JUST THAT I FORGOT
THAT I EVEN HAD IT.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.125
YOU MISSED
THE COURT APPEARANCE

18:05.209 --> 18:06.668
BEFORE YOU GOT
THE BOYFRIEND, HUH?

18:06.752 --> 18:08.962
3 MONTHS FOR HIM.
WHAT, THE TICKET'S
7 MONTHS OLD?

18:09.046 --> 18:10.297
WHO'S YOUR BOYFRIEND?

18:11.548 --> 18:15.177
NO. I'M THE WANTED
CRIMINAL HERE,

18:15.260 --> 18:16.929
AND I'M GONNA
HANDLE THIS ON MY OWN.

18:19.139 --> 18:21.433
IS HE A COP?

18:21.517 --> 18:23.310
ANYWAYS, I GET
BOOKED NOW

18:23.393 --> 18:25.270
AND THEN I GET
TO MAKE BAIL?

18:25.312 --> 18:26.980
YOU SOUND
PRETTY FAMILIAR

18:27.064 --> 18:28.482
WITH THE COURT SYSTEM,
NADINE.

18:28.565 --> 18:29.983
NADINE HAS GOT SOME
PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE

18:30.067 --> 18:32.486
ON A PROSTITUTION COLLAR
FROM LAST JULY.

18:32.569 --> 18:35.614
I GOT A SUMMONS
FOR UNLICENSED MASSAGE.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.118
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:39.201 --> 18:41.620
TOMMY RICHARDSON HELP YOU
GET THAT CHARGE REDUCED?

18:41.703 --> 18:44.957
AM I GONNA GET ARRESTED
FOR A NO LEFT TURN?

18:45.040 --> 18:46.625
TOUGH AIN'T GONNA
MAKE IT, NADINE.

18:46.708 --> 18:49.253
DID TOMMY TALK YOU
INTO HELPING HIM OUT
WITH THIS HOMICIDE?

18:49.294 --> 18:50.796
WHAT?

18:50.879 --> 18:52.339
A HOMICIDE,
NADINE.

18:52.422 --> 18:53.799
ANOTHER GIRL
BESIDES YOU

18:53.841 --> 18:54.925
TOMMY'S ALSO
CHEATING ON
HIS WIFE WITH

18:54.967 --> 18:56.802
GETTING STABBED
AND STRANGLED.

18:56.885 --> 18:58.345
LOOK, I WANT A LAWYER,

18:58.428 --> 19:00.013
BECAUSE I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT
ANYTHING THAT YOU'RE SAYING.

19:00.097 --> 19:01.431
YOU'RE SAYING YOU DON'T
KNOW TOMMY RICHARDSON?

19:01.473 --> 19:04.643
I KNOW TOMMY RICHARDSON
VERY CASUALLY.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.019
BEEN SEEING HIM MORE
VERY CASUALLY

19:06.103 --> 19:07.146
THE LAST FEW WEEKS?

19:07.187 --> 19:08.897
SAY I AM.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.774
THAT WOULD BE 'CAUSE HIS
OTHER GIRLFRIEND'S DEAD.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.695
AS FAR AS ME
SEEING HIM MORE,

19:14.778 --> 19:16.822
THE ONLY THING HE SAID

19:16.864 --> 19:17.990
WAS THAT HE PUT IN
FOR A TRANSFER

19:18.031 --> 19:19.491
AND HE WAS TAKING
VACATION DAYS

19:19.533 --> 19:20.701
UNTIL THE TRANSFER
CAME THROUGH.

19:20.784 --> 19:22.661
HE PUT IN FOR A TRANSFER
BECAUSE THIS WAS HIS HOUSE

19:22.703 --> 19:24.496
AND HE KNOWS THAT
WE LIKE HIM FOR A MURDER.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.039
YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT ME.

19:26.123 --> 19:27.958
HE NEVER SAID NOTHING
ABOUT THE OTHER GIRLFRIEND?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.334
WOULD YOU?

19:30.294 --> 19:32.337
WHAT'S HE SAID
ABOUT HIS WIFE?

19:32.421 --> 19:34.840
NOTHING. CALLS HER A MUTT.

19:34.882 --> 19:37.759
SOMEONE LOOKS TO HURT YOU
ON THIS BENCH WARRANT,
NADINE--

19:37.843 --> 19:39.178
YOU GET FINED
A COUPLE OF GRAND

19:39.261 --> 19:40.345
OR A JAIL ALTERNATIVE,

19:40.429 --> 19:42.556
THEN YOUR LICENSE IS LIFTED
ON THE ORIGINAL INFRACTION.

19:42.639 --> 19:44.141
YOU LOOK LIKE
THE KIND OF GIRL

19:44.183 --> 19:45.559
WHO WOULD DRIVE
WITHOUT A LICENSE,

19:45.642 --> 19:47.561
BUT HAVE YOU GOT
THE 2 GRAND?

19:47.644 --> 19:49.897
LOOK, TOMMY AND ME
ARE NO BIG THING.

19:49.980 --> 19:53.609
MM-HMM. WOULD YOU
BE WILLING TO, UH...

19:53.692 --> 19:55.527
GET IN TOUCH WITH US
IF TOMMY BECAME TALKATIVE?

19:55.611 --> 19:58.322
ANYTHING HE SAYS TO ME,

19:58.363 --> 19:59.698
I'D BE HAPPY
TO REPORT IT TO YOU.

19:59.740 --> 20:00.699
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.701
AS LONG AS I DON'T
HAVE TO TESTIFY.

20:02.743 --> 20:05.370
WE WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE
YOUR COOPERATION.

20:05.412 --> 20:06.705
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THE BENCH WARRANT?

20:06.747 --> 20:08.248
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT US.

20:08.332 --> 20:09.458
PAY THE TICKET,

20:09.541 --> 20:11.877
YOU WON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT ANYBODY.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.045
OK. GREAT.

20:14.546 --> 20:15.714
HERE'S HOW
YOU REACH US.

20:15.797 --> 20:18.717
RIGHT. ANYTHING HE SAYS.

20:22.596 --> 20:26.058
SO...I MAY BE TALKING
TO YOU SOON.

20:26.099 --> 20:27.267
OK.

20:33.106 --> 20:35.025
LAST YOU'RE GONNA
HEAR FROM NADINE.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.693
YEAH, LAST YOU'RE GONNA
HEAR FROM NADINE.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.862
SO YOU'RE GOING BACK
AT RICHARDSON'S WIFE

20:38.904 --> 20:40.239
AFTER THIS ONE
RATS US OUT
TO TOMMY.

20:40.322 --> 20:41.657
HIS WIFE'S
WHO HE'S BATTERING.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.867
HIS WIFE'S WHO HE'S GONNA
TELL HE DID THE MURDER.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.869
SHE'S LIABLE TO TAKE
A PRETTY GOOD BEATING

20:45.911 --> 20:47.120
BEFORE HE GETS
AROUND TO THAT.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.581
WHAT ELSE AM I
GONNA DO, DIANE?

20:49.623 --> 20:51.458
NO. I...I KNOW.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.854
WE GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THIS TERESA OCASIO,

21:12.938 --> 21:14.398
THIS GIRL
THAT WE TALKED TO

21:14.439 --> 21:17.109
AT THE APARTMENT
WHERE WE FOUND
THE D.O.A. IN A BATHTUB.

21:17.150 --> 21:19.152
[MOUTH FULL]
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

21:19.236 --> 21:22.698
THIS TERESA'S MAKING LIKE
SHE HARDLY KNEW THE VICTIM,

21:22.781 --> 21:23.865
THIS MIGUEL.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.367
AND NOW MIGUEL'S BROTHER

21:25.450 --> 21:28.412
SAYS THAT TERESA AND MIGUEL
HAD BEEN GOING TOGETHER

21:28.453 --> 21:30.122
AND MIGUEL HAD JUST
BROKE IT OFF.

21:32.666 --> 21:34.793
I THINK GREG MEANS
PROBLEM IN THE SENSE,

21:34.835 --> 21:36.962
MAYBE SHE WAS INVOLVED.

21:37.045 --> 21:40.340
SO YOU NOW THINK SHE
WAS A PARTICIPANT
IN A CRIME.

21:40.424 --> 21:41.967
YEAH, EXACTLY.

21:42.009 --> 21:44.344
WELL, YOU'D BETTER
PICK HER UP.

21:44.428 --> 21:45.804
RIGHT.

22:04.197 --> 22:06.491
WELL, YOU'VE HAD
A BUSY MORNING.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.201
EVERYTHING
WENT HAYWIRE.

22:08.285 --> 22:11.955
DR. SAMSON SEEMS TO BE
GETTING A HANDLE
ON WHAT'S GOING ON.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.206
DR. SAMSON--

22:13.290 --> 22:14.499
OF SAMSON
AND DELILAH.

22:14.541 --> 22:17.669
AND SAMSON
PORTABLE LUGGAGE.

22:17.753 --> 22:20.630
YOUR FIRST TESTS
LOOKED GOOD,
MR. SIPOWICZ.

22:20.672 --> 22:23.133
YOUR CREATINE
PHOSPHOCOZYMASE
IS A LITTLE BIT HIGH,

22:23.175 --> 22:25.344
BUT YOUR MB FRACTION
IS NORMAL.

22:25.427 --> 22:28.513
BECAUSE MY MATH FRACTION
WAS A "B" IN SCHOOL.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.557
IF YOUR HUSBAND'S
MB FRACTION WERE ELEVATED,

22:30.640 --> 22:32.225
THAT WOULD SUGGEST
HE HAD A HEART ATTACK.

22:32.309 --> 22:33.852
SO YOU'VE
RULED THAT OUT?

22:33.894 --> 22:36.229
NO. THEY'VE HAVE TO DRAW
ANOTHER BLOOD SAMPLE
IN A FEW HOURS.

22:36.313 --> 22:38.231
THAT'LL TELL
MORE DEFINITIVELY.

22:38.315 --> 22:41.026
THIS WAS THE RESULT
YOU WANTED FROM
THE PRELIMINARY TEST.

22:41.109 --> 22:42.069
I WON'T TAKE
NO MORE TESTS.

22:42.152 --> 22:44.571
THOSE TESTS
MADE ME SICK.

22:44.654 --> 22:48.033
WE DO THINK THAT YOU
REACTED TO THE DYE
IN THE C.A.T. SCAN.

22:48.075 --> 22:50.035
BELIEVE ME, MY CANCER
IN MY PROSTRATE

22:50.118 --> 22:51.912
BECAME THE LEAST
OF MY PROBLEMS.

22:51.995 --> 22:53.955
WHAT WE'RE STILL
WORKING ON

22:54.039 --> 22:55.540
IS WHETHER THE SYMPTOMS
IN YOUR HUSBAND'S CHEST

22:55.624 --> 22:56.750
WERE PART OF
THE ALLERGIC RESPONSE

22:56.833 --> 22:58.919
OR CAUSED A SEPARATE
SET OF PROBLEMS.

22:59.002 --> 23:01.254
WELL, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT KILLING ME
IN THE MEANTIME.

23:01.338 --> 23:03.757
NO ONE WANTS
TO KILL YOU, ANDY.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.385
I CAN NAME 50 PEOPLE
WHO WOULD LIKE
TO SEE ME DEAD.

23:06.426 --> 23:10.263
I THINK WE'RE HEARING
SOME OF THE DECADRON
TALKING.

23:10.347 --> 23:12.682
PLEASE DON'T EXCLUDE ME
AND MY HUSBAND FROM
THIS CONVERSATION.

23:12.724 --> 23:14.518
DON'T LET THEM
THROW YOU OUT.

23:14.559 --> 23:17.062
THE MEDICINE THAT ANDY
NEEDED TO HELP WITH
HIS ALLERGIC REACTION

23:17.104 --> 23:21.149
SOMETIMES GET PATIENTS
A LITTLE EXCITED
AND CONFUSED.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.193
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

23:23.235 --> 23:25.362
SOMETIMES I WONDER.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.614
YEAH? CRACK WISE
AT MY WIFE'S EXPENSE
FURTHER

23:27.697 --> 23:29.449
SO I CAN LAUNCH YOU
THROUGH THE WINDOW.

23:29.533 --> 23:32.786
ANYWAY, WE SEEM TO BE
COMING OUT OF
THE WOODS HERE,

23:32.869 --> 23:35.705
AND DR. SAMSON IS GONNA
KEEP ME POSTED.

23:35.747 --> 23:37.124
SAMSONITE PORTABLE.

23:37.207 --> 23:39.042
GORILLA IN
THE LUGGAGE
CONVEYOR.

23:46.299 --> 23:49.052
SAD PUMPKIN.

24:14.828 --> 24:16.246
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I'M HERE.

24:16.329 --> 24:17.998
I TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING I KNOW.

24:18.081 --> 24:19.749
NO, TERESA.
YOU DIDN'T TELL US

24:19.791 --> 24:22.210
YOU AND MIGUEL
WERE GOING OUT.

24:22.252 --> 24:23.587
WHERE'D YOU HEAR THAT?

24:23.670 --> 24:25.172
MIGUEL'S BROTHER JOSé

24:25.255 --> 24:28.175
TOLD US THAT YOU AND MIGUEL
HAD BEEN DATING.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.429
TERESA, WE'RE
INVESTIGATING A MURDER.

24:32.512 --> 24:34.014
I KNOW.

24:34.097 --> 24:35.891
WHAT MIGUEL'S
BROTHER TOLD US,

24:35.932 --> 24:37.225
IN OUR MINDS,

24:37.267 --> 24:39.102
THAT GIVES YOU
A POSSIBLE MOTIVE

24:39.186 --> 24:40.770
FOR WHAT HAPPENED
TO MIGUEL.

24:40.812 --> 24:42.105
TERESA,

24:42.189 --> 24:44.107
IF YOU DON'T
START COOPERATING,

24:44.191 --> 24:46.443
WE'RE GONNA START
ASKING OURSELVES
WHY YOU AREN'T.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.237
MIGUEL WAS DEAD
IN YOUR BATHTUB.

24:49.279 --> 24:51.281
SO HE WAS DEAD
IN OUR BATHTUB?

24:54.784 --> 24:56.244
MIGUEL'S BROTHER
TOLD US

24:56.286 --> 24:58.205
THAT MIGUEL BROKE UP
WITH YOU LAST WEEK.

24:58.288 --> 25:00.123
WHAT DOES HE KNOW?

25:00.207 --> 25:02.542
MIGUEL MUST HAVE
LIED TO HIM.

25:02.626 --> 25:05.462
MIGUEL WAS PUTTING
PRESSURE ON ME.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.130
WHAT KIND OF PRESSURE?

25:07.172 --> 25:10.133
MIGUEL WAS PUTTING
PRESSURE ON ME
TO HAVE SEX.

25:10.217 --> 25:12.969
I KEPT SAYING NO,
AND I THOUGHT HE WAS
COOL WITH IT, BUT...

25:13.011 --> 25:15.972
LAST NIGHT, HE JUST--
HE WOULDN'T STOP.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.975
WE WERE OUT DRIVING
IN HIS CAR,

25:19.059 --> 25:21.436
AND HE PULLED OVER
AND HE RAPED ME.

25:21.478 --> 25:23.271
HE RAPED YOU?

25:25.148 --> 25:28.193
TERESA, JUST TO GO BACK
FOR A MOMENT,

25:28.276 --> 25:30.278
ARE YOU TELLING US THAT,
BEFORE LAST NIGHT,

25:30.320 --> 25:31.613
YOU AND MIGUEL
HAD NEVER HAD SEX?

25:31.655 --> 25:34.741
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

25:34.824 --> 25:37.994
GOING BACK TO HIM
RAPING YOU LAST NIGHT,

25:38.036 --> 25:39.996
DID YOU TELL ANYONE?

25:41.831 --> 25:43.166
YOU GO TO THE HOSPITAL?

25:43.208 --> 25:45.001
I WAS AFRAID MY FATHER
WOULD FIND OUT,

25:45.085 --> 25:46.419
SO I WOULDN'T GO.

25:46.503 --> 25:49.005
SO YOU DIDN'T
TELL YOUR FATHER?

25:49.047 --> 25:50.423
NO. MIGUEL
DROPPED ME OFF HOME,

25:50.507 --> 25:54.010
AND THAT'S ALL
I KNOW ABOUT HIM.

25:54.052 --> 25:55.845
WHERE'D YOU GO AFTER
HE DROPPED YOU OFF?

25:55.887 --> 25:57.430
JUST WALKING.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.015
MM.

25:59.099 --> 26:03.186
TERESA, WE ARRIVE AT YOUR
AND YOUR FATHER'S APARTMENT

26:03.228 --> 26:04.688
TO FIND YOUR
FORMER LOVER--

26:04.729 --> 26:05.981
LOVER?!

26:06.022 --> 26:09.526
BOYFRIEND. WE FIND
YOUR FORMER BOYFRIEND DEAD

26:09.568 --> 26:11.319
WITH A BULLET IN HIS CHEST,

26:11.361 --> 26:12.821
YOUR FATHER WITH A CHAIN SAW

26:12.862 --> 26:15.365
UNCONSCIOUS FROM SOME TYPE
OF ELECTRIC SHOCK.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.033
IT DON'T TAKE
TOO MUCH TO IMAGINE

26:17.117 --> 26:18.535
YOUR FATHER COULD
HAVE GOT THE SHOCK

26:18.577 --> 26:20.704
PREPARING
TO DISMEMBER MIGUEL

26:20.745 --> 26:23.123
AFTER SOMEONE MURDERED HIM.

26:24.457 --> 26:25.875
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

26:27.586 --> 26:30.213
THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO LOOK AT YOUR DAD.

26:34.801 --> 26:36.344
LITTLE SOCIOPATH.

26:36.386 --> 26:38.013
WHAT?!

26:38.054 --> 26:39.389
NOTHING.

26:49.232 --> 26:50.650
WHOOPS.

26:50.734 --> 26:51.901
SORRY.

26:51.943 --> 26:53.570
OH, NO PROBLEM.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.238
IF I'D EVER BEEN
THAT LIMBER,

26:55.280 --> 26:57.073
MY HUSBAND
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
HE WENT TO HEAVEN.

26:57.157 --> 27:00.076
I'M TRYING TO RESUME
MY BALLET CAREER
THAT NEVER EXISTED.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.578
IS THAT RIGHT?

27:01.661 --> 27:04.414
YEAH. I JOINED
AN AMATEUR COMPANY
IN BROOKLYN.

27:04.456 --> 27:07.000
WE'RE HAVING OUR FIRST
PERFORMANCE TONIGHT.

27:07.083 --> 27:08.752
THAT'S GREAT, DOLORES.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.253
I GET TO FALL
ON MY ASS

27:10.295 --> 27:11.671
IN FRONT OF
A BIG AUDIENCE--

27:11.755 --> 27:13.256
17, 18 PEOPLE.

27:13.298 --> 27:15.175
NAH. I BET YOU DON'T.

27:15.258 --> 27:17.636
ANYWAY, THEY CAN'T SHOOT YOU
FOR TRYING, RIGHT?

27:17.719 --> 27:19.721
HEY. CAN'T SHOOT YOU
FOR TRYING.

27:19.763 --> 27:22.766
DON'T TELL ANYONE,
ALL RIGHT, THOUGH?

27:22.807 --> 27:24.267
NO, I WON'T.

27:24.309 --> 27:26.061
BUT WILL YOU
LET ME KNOW
HOW IT GOES?

27:26.102 --> 27:27.854
SURE.

27:27.937 --> 27:29.856
JUST DON'T TELL ME
TO BREAK A LEG,

27:29.939 --> 27:31.524
'CAUSE I JUST MIGHT.

27:40.909 --> 27:43.995
WE'RE STILL WAITING
TO GET THE SECOND SET
OF TESTS BACK,

27:44.079 --> 27:46.247
BUT ANDY'S FEELING
MORE COMFORTABLE
IN HIS CHEST.

27:46.289 --> 27:47.666
THAT'S A PLUS,
NO MATTER WHAT.

27:47.749 --> 27:49.292
AND NOT TO TELL THEO.

27:49.376 --> 27:50.794
HE UNDERSTANDS.

27:50.835 --> 27:52.545
I DON'T WANT HIM
TO UNDERSTAND.

27:52.629 --> 27:54.464
I AM SAYING MY FATHER
UNDERSTANDS NOT TO
TELL THE BABY.

27:54.547 --> 27:56.549
THEN THAT'S
A DIFFERENT SUBJECT.

27:58.468 --> 28:00.095
OH, DADDY, THE DOCTOR
JUST CAME IN,

28:00.136 --> 28:02.180
SO I'LL CALL YOU
IF I'M COMING HOME.

28:02.263 --> 28:05.350
WOULD YOU TELL THEO THAT
MOMMY AND DADDY LOVE HIM?

28:05.433 --> 28:07.268
EVERYONE'S COMING HOME.

28:07.310 --> 28:10.313
OK. I'LL LET HIM KNOW.
THANKS. BYE.

28:10.397 --> 28:11.564
MY DAD SAYS HE LOVES YOU.

28:11.648 --> 28:12.691
MY WIFE'S FATHER,

28:12.774 --> 28:14.734
IN HIS APARTMENT
WITH OUR SON.

28:14.818 --> 28:17.654
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
A HEART ATTACK.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.155
[RELIEVED SIGH]

28:19.239 --> 28:20.198
OH, THANK GOD.

28:20.281 --> 28:21.366
THAT'S CORRECT.
WHERE'S MY CLOTHES?

28:21.449 --> 28:23.368
HOLD ON, MR. SIPOWICZ--

28:23.451 --> 28:24.619
NO. I HAVE
TO GO HOME NOW.

28:24.661 --> 28:25.704
YOU HAD CHEST SYMPTOMS.

28:25.787 --> 28:27.330
EVEN THOUGH YOUR HEART
WASN'T DAMAGED,

28:27.414 --> 28:29.165
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
IF YOU MAY HAVE
SOME BLOCKAGES

28:29.207 --> 28:30.542
IN THE ARTERIES
AROUND YOUR HEART.

28:30.625 --> 28:32.043
WE STILL HAVE PLANS
FOR YOU, MY FRIEND.

28:32.127 --> 28:33.336
NO HEART ATTACK
FOR ME.

28:33.378 --> 28:34.838
OH, I SAW THE CHART.
THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

28:34.879 --> 28:37.382
YOU'LL GIVE HIM
A THALLIUM STRESS TEST
TOMORROW?

28:37.465 --> 28:39.175
I HAD JUST BEGUN
DISCUSSING ALTERNATIVES.

28:39.259 --> 28:41.261
WE'LL PUT YOU ON A TREADMILL
TO RULE OUT ANGINA.

28:41.344 --> 28:43.221
ASSUMING THAT THE TREADMILL
IS NEGATIVE,

28:43.304 --> 28:45.014
WE'LL PUT A GOOD STRONG
DOSE OF BENADRYL ON BOARD

28:45.056 --> 28:46.516
AND REDO YOUR C.A.T. SCAN.

28:46.558 --> 28:47.851
NO TESTS NOW.

28:47.934 --> 28:49.227
NO TESTS RIGHT NOW,
MR. SIPOWICZ.

28:49.310 --> 28:51.771
Dr. Talbot: I DO THINK,
THOUGH, ONCE WE HAVE
CLEARED ANDY

28:51.855 --> 28:53.189
ON THE CHEST FRONT,

28:53.273 --> 28:56.025
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO STICK TO
OUR ORIGINAL GAME PLAN.

28:57.444 --> 28:59.696
I MAY HAVE PROSTRATE
CANCER ALL OVER ME.

28:59.779 --> 29:01.948
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING
TO WORRY ABOUT TONIGHT.

29:02.031 --> 29:03.575
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

29:03.658 --> 29:06.411
DON'T MAKE ME TRY
TO DO IT TOMORROW,
NEITHER.

29:06.494 --> 29:09.080
I DO BELIEVE DR. SAMPSON
IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

29:09.164 --> 29:11.541
LET'S LET TOMORROW
TAKE CARE OF ITSELF.

29:11.624 --> 29:15.044
DON'T YOU LIE TO ME,
YOU JACK-O'-LANTERN
SON OF A BITCH.

29:15.086 --> 29:16.254
CALM DOWN, ANDY.

29:16.337 --> 29:18.715
AREN'T YOU AWARE
WHAT'S TRANSPIRING?

29:18.757 --> 29:21.885
HE'S TRYING
TO COMPLICATE ME
INTO DEATH.

29:21.926 --> 29:23.553
TAKE IT EASY, ANDY.

29:23.636 --> 29:24.763
A LOT OF DECENT GUYS
CLAM UP,

29:24.846 --> 29:26.556
BUT BEING DECENT

29:26.598 --> 29:28.224
DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE
LESS WORSE.

29:28.266 --> 29:29.893
HE NEEDS TO BE TRANQUILIZED.

29:29.976 --> 29:31.227
YOU PULL A TRANQUILIZER
GUN ON ME

29:31.311 --> 29:33.396
AND THE SAFARI STOPS
AT THE DENTIST.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.732
HE'S GOT
THE WRONG ELEPHANT.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.942
SYLVIA, DO YOU WANT
TO COME OUTSIDE
AND TALK TO ME?

29:38.026 --> 29:39.986
NO, I DON'T,
AND I DON'T WANT ANDY
GETTING UPSET AGAIN.

29:40.069 --> 29:41.488
WELL, NEITHER DO I.

29:41.571 --> 29:44.073
BUT THIS IS A HOSPITAL,
AND WE DO NEED
TO PRACTICE MEDICINE.

29:44.157 --> 29:46.910
I WANT TO SUGGEST
AN APPROACH TO ADDRESS
ANDY'S ANXIETIES,

29:46.993 --> 29:48.787
AND I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO STEP OUTSIDE TO HEAR IT.

29:48.870 --> 29:50.580
YOU THINK I'M
A DEAD INVALID?

29:50.663 --> 29:51.831
LIE DOWN, ANDY.

29:51.915 --> 29:53.208
YOU STEP OUTSIDE
WITH ANYBODY,

29:53.249 --> 29:54.167
YOU'RE GONNA
STEP OUTSIDE WITH ME.

29:54.250 --> 29:55.251
LIE BACK DOWN, ANDY.

29:55.335 --> 29:57.337
YOU RAT BASTARD
HEADLESS HORSEMAN!

29:57.420 --> 29:59.005
NOW YOU'RE GONNA
GIVE ME CHEST PAIN
AGAIN!

29:59.088 --> 30:00.256
Sylvia: DOCTOR,
LOOK AT THE MACHINE.

30:00.340 --> 30:01.508
LIE DOWN!
THE LEAD
IS DISCONNECTED.

30:01.591 --> 30:02.634
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME
CHEST PAIN AGAIN!

30:02.717 --> 30:04.135
ANDY, I WANT YOU
TO LIE BACK

30:04.219 --> 30:07.305
AND CALM DOWN!

30:07.388 --> 30:09.766
JUST LIE STILL
FOR 15 SECONDS.

30:09.849 --> 30:11.434
[BEEPING RAPIDLY]

PUT ME ON REPORT,
BUT HE DIDN'T.

42:06.148 --> 42:10.027
MY PRESENT PHYSICIAN...

42:10.110 --> 42:11.987
I'D RATHER
4 ONCOMING VEHICLES

42:12.071 --> 42:14.323
TARGET ME
IN AN INTERSECTION.

42:14.365 --> 42:15.783
SO WITH THIS
GREAT RAPPORT,

42:15.824 --> 42:17.785
HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE
TO PERSUADE
DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ

42:17.826 --> 42:19.161
TO BEHAVE
LIKE A PATIENT?

42:19.245 --> 42:21.455
YOU DON'T FIGURE
A FEW BREATHS
IN A NEUTRAL CORNER

42:21.497 --> 42:24.166
MIGHT DO HIM SOME GOOD
BEFORE YOU PUT HIM BACK
IN THE RING?

42:24.250 --> 42:26.126
HIS CANCER MAY BE
METASTASIZING.

42:26.168 --> 42:29.171
IT NEEDS TO BE STAGED.
HE SHOULD NOT
BE GOING HOME.

42:29.213 --> 42:31.131
WHATEVER THE STAGING
OF THE TUMOR, DOCTOR,

42:31.173 --> 42:35.177
IF HE HAD STRESS-INDUCED
ANGINA AND YOU KEEP HIM
IN A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT

42:35.261 --> 42:36.679
WHILE HIS MEDICATION'S
MAKING HIM PARANOID,

42:36.720 --> 42:38.389
YOU MAY GIVE HIM
THE HEART ATTACK
HE DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE.

42:38.472 --> 42:39.807
I AGREE WITH DR. MONZAK.

42:39.848 --> 42:41.684
YOU AGREE
WITH DR. MONZAK.

42:41.767 --> 42:45.646
IF HE'LL AGREE TO
AN OUTPATIENT TREADMILL
WITHIN 72 HOURS...

42:45.688 --> 42:48.148
THE PATIENT SHOULD BE
SENT HOME.

42:48.190 --> 42:51.860
MRS. SIPOWICZ,
IF YOUR HUSBAND
LEAVES THIS HOSPITAL

42:51.944 --> 42:53.362
AGAINST MY ADVICE,

42:53.445 --> 42:55.864
WHEN HE GETS AROUND
TO HAVING HIS TUMOR
TREATED,

42:55.948 --> 42:57.491
HE CAN DO IT WITH
ANOTHER UROLOGIST.

42:57.533 --> 42:59.034
SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

42:59.076 --> 43:02.329
IS THERE PAPERWORK
FOR SIGNING OUT
AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE?

43:02.371 --> 43:04.832
YES. LET ME PREPARE
THE PAPERWORK

43:04.873 --> 43:07.918
FOR SIGNING OUT
AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE.

43:10.796 --> 43:12.381
YOU'RE GOIN' HOME.

43:15.843 --> 43:17.386
THANK GOD.

43:19.096 --> 43:21.849
THANK GOD.
