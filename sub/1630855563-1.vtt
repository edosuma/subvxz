00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:26.965
What's up favorite niece?

2
00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:29.384
I'm supposed to tell you not to be
late for the party tonight.

3
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.136
Of course.

4
00:10:15.574 --> 00:10:17.951
As the great poet Song Lian said...

5
00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:22.164
"Man is limited
only by his imagination."

6
00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:27.169
My father named me Jiuming,

7
00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:30.339
which means ocean

8
00:10:30.422 --> 00:10:31.507
or abyss.

9
00:10:34.426 --> 00:10:38.305
My father and my sister
spent their lives studying the ocean.

10
00:10:39.515 --> 00:10:42.726
It wasn't until they were both gone
that I began to wonder

11
00:10:43.352 --> 00:10:45.229
what my purpose was.

12
00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:47.564
But through Suyin's daughter Meiying,

13
00:10:47.898 --> 00:10:49.316
I saw that there was a future.

14
00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:54.988
I merged my father's research institute
with my company

15
00:10:56.281 --> 00:11:01.119
to carry forward our tradition
of exploring the unknown in their honor.

16
00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:07.167
To mark this tenth anniversary,

17
00:11:07.668 --> 00:11:10.212
I want to introduce you all
to someone very special.

18
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.138
Her name is Haiqi.

19
00:11:20.222 --> 00:11:23.058
She is the world's only megalodon
in captivity.

20
00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:25.686
We found her injured as a pup.

21
00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:29.147
Thanks to Haiqi, we've learned a
tremendous amount about the megalodons

22
00:11:29.231 --> 00:11:30.691
as well as the trench where they live.

23
00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:58.051
Protecting the ocean is crucial,
for China and all mankind.

24
00:11:58.427 --> 00:11:59.344
Thank you.

25
00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:17.196
Do you think there are more creatures
to be discovered down there?

26
00:12:17.905 --> 00:12:19.114
There has to be.

27
00:14:12.728 --> 00:14:13.770
Uncle, are you crazy?

28
00:15:55.873 --> 00:15:57.541
Slowly, slowly.

29
00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:40.918
Total success.

30
00:16:43.378 --> 00:16:44.880
Uncle! Are you crazy?

31
00:16:45.339 --> 00:16:46.465
It's all right, I'm good.

32
00:18:05.961 --> 00:18:09.006
Yes, whenever you're ready?

33
00:18:09.965 --> 00:18:13.010
These new suits will let us travel
anywhere and at any depth underwater.

34
00:18:19.183 --> 00:18:20.434
No worries, no worries.

35
00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:29.735
Mom and Grandpa talked about you
all the time.

36
00:18:31.987 --> 00:18:33.447
Nothing good I suppose.

37
00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:35.407
Wanna guess?

38
00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:39.286
See this scar?

39
00:18:40.704 --> 00:18:42.956
When I was 11
my father was busy in the lab.

40
00:18:43.916 --> 00:18:46.043
So I snuck out to swim with my friends
on the rocky shores...

41
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.837
and had to get nine stitches
as a result of it.

42
00:18:49.588 --> 00:18:51.381
When I returned home
my father taught me a real lesson.

43
00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:53.842
Grandpa?

44
00:18:54.051 --> 00:18:54.968
Of course.

45
00:18:55.219 --> 00:18:57.262
He was kind to you
because you're his granddaughter,

46
00:18:57.763 --> 00:18:59.556
but he was tough on me.

47
00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:04.895
So after college, I started a company.

48
00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:08.482
I wanted to get away from him.

49
00:19:09.483 --> 00:19:12.319
I hadn't had any contact
with your grandfather for many years.

50
00:19:12.778 --> 00:19:15.280
Then he asked your mom
to bring me this calligraphy.

51
00:19:16.365 --> 00:19:18.242
"Dragon travelling
across the Four Seas."

52
00:19:19.326 --> 00:19:20.911
I thought it was a form of ridicule...

53
00:19:22.037 --> 00:19:26.667
but I came to realize that he wanted me
to find my own way.

54
00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.463
Like the dragon...

55
00:19:31.547 --> 00:19:34.258
I hope you can find your own fate.

56
00:23:25.948 --> 00:23:27.074
What the hell are you doing?

57
00:38:18.549 --> 00:38:19.466
Uncle, I thought you --

58
00:38:20.801 --> 00:38:22.636
You're not going to get rid of me
that easily.

59
00:45:26.685 --> 00:45:27.519
Hold on!

60
00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.159
Karma will get you.

61
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:15.584
Shut up!

62
00:59:55.387 --> 00:59:56.597
I don't think I can make it!

63
00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:58.307
You can do it. It's ok.

64
01:00:47.356 --> 01:00:48.482
We're going to die!

65
01:00:48.565 --> 01:00:49.399
It's ok, it's ok.

66
01:03:33.021 --> 01:03:34.273
Thank you for working.

67
01:05:01.235 --> 01:05:02.653
Very funny.

68
01:10:21.388 --> 01:10:22.764
I know you're looking for me and Jonas.

69
01:10:22.848 --> 01:10:24.308
I also know you don't speak Chinese,

70
01:10:24.391 --> 01:10:27.269
but I'm speaking it
to distract you guys,

71
01:10:27.352 --> 01:10:29.146
because my friend is about
to attack you from behind.

72
01:16:46.982 --> 01:16:49.026
Can you put your phone down?

73
01:16:49.109 --> 01:16:51.403
After all these hard years
we're finally on vacation,

74
01:16:51.486 --> 01:16:53.447
savor the moment.

75
01:16:56.074 --> 01:16:59.203
I've already got 400 likes.

76
01:17:24.436 --> 01:17:25.395
Come over.

77
01:17:26.605 --> 01:17:27.439
What?

78
01:17:31.026 --> 01:17:32.194
What are you doing?

79
01:17:38.659 --> 01:17:39.535
Yaoyao...

80
01:17:42.704 --> 01:17:43.664
Will you marry me?

81
01:17:48.836 --> 01:17:50.170
Find it, idiot!

82
01:17:51.004 --> 01:17:52.005
Wait!

83
01:17:54.132 --> 01:17:55.050
Have you found it?

84
01:20:43.135 --> 01:20:43.969
Go back!

85
01:20:44.052 --> 01:20:45.012
Don't go into the water!

86
01:20:45.095 --> 01:20:46.305
There's a shark!

87
01:36:06.975 --> 01:36:08.227
Hang on, Meiying!

88
01:37:31.727 --> 01:37:33.395
Throw me the bomb!

89
01:37:36.106 --> 01:37:36.940
Catch it!

90
01:44:02.117 --> 01:44:03.702
Next time don't run around, ok?
