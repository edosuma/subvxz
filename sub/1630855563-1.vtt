03:37.801 --> 03:39.761
-  It's highly toxic.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.721
Come on, lads, keep it moving.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.098
Keep it moving.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.436
Go, go, go!

03:48.895 --> 03:50.355
Is this double pay or what?

03:50.355 --> 03:51.523
There is toxic waste.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.781
What are you doing
sitting there, mate?

03:59.781 --> 04:01.450
- You're almost there.

04:01.450 --> 04:03.660
I want this filth off my ship
as fast as possible.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.765
What you doing, then?

04:27.142 --> 04:28.477
Naughty.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.146
Help! Help!

04:31.980 --> 04:33.273
Naughty.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.691
Shh.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.109
- Keep your little beak shut.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.402
Not very nice.

04:37.402 --> 04:38.862
Otherwise,
you'll go for a swim.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.281
- Help! Help!

04:41.281 --> 04:43.825
Help me! Help me!

04:43.825 --> 04:46.411
- Hey.
- Ah. Well done.

04:46.411 --> 04:47.829
I'm here from the home office.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.206
Bullshit.

04:49.206 --> 04:51.750
Here checking on,
uh, security protocols...

04:53.210 --> 04:54.920
...and, um, taking
a few pictures, so smile.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.215
What are you doing in here?

04:58.215 --> 04:59.633
-  Not very nice.
- What's going on?

05:04.387 --> 05:05.847
That's him!

05:05.847 --> 05:06.848
- I'll get you!

05:14.940 --> 05:16.650
Hey, hey!
Get at this!

05:33.792 --> 05:35.085
-  Get up.
-  Get Him down!

05:37.462 --> 05:39.756
You two, go left!
Cut him off!

05:39.756 --> 05:41.716
I want him caught,
dead or dead.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.222
Not there!
Go around! Go around!

05:50.141 --> 05:52.102
There you go, mate.
End of the line.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.021
Okay.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.107
You're all under arrest.

05:57.107 --> 05:58.567
-  Huh?
- For the illegal dumping

05:58.567 --> 06:00.151
- of radioactive materials.

06:00.151 --> 06:04.239
Yeah, you, you,
you, you and you.

06:04.239 --> 06:07.284
What, me and...
and him, and him? And him?

06:09.035 --> 06:11.121
- Kill him.
-  Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

06:11.121 --> 06:14.291
I know.
You want to see the warrant.

06:14.291 --> 06:15.750
It's right in my pocket.

06:17.419 --> 06:18.795
I'll see you in court, yeah?

06:24.301 --> 06:26.261
We're out of shipping lanes,

06:26.261 --> 06:28.138
and you're 200 miles
from shore.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.806
So enjoy your swim.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.022
I've got him.
Just off the port side.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.359
He's like a green James Bond.
I like it.

06:45.363 --> 06:46.698
Oh, no, my hat!

06:47.949 --> 06:49.159
Hello, suckers.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.702
Looks like
he's been making friends.

06:50.702 --> 06:53.246
Wherever he goes,
people just love him.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.456
God knows why.

06:59.711 --> 07:00.754
Do you got this?

07:02.005 --> 07:03.089
We'll see.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.010
Maybe this wasn't
the best idea.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.304
Maybe this isn't
the best idea.

07:09.304 --> 07:11.514
This is gonna be awesome.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.849
Define "awesome."

07:12.849 --> 07:14.309
I'm about to.

07:15.810 --> 07:16.728
Opening hatch.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.371
Next time, put a little
more air in this thing.

07:34.371 --> 07:35.914
It's like breathing
through a straw.

07:35.914 --> 07:37.540
Worked, didn't it?

07:37.540 --> 07:39.209
You okay?

07:39.209 --> 07:40.627
If you love your job,

07:40.627 --> 07:42.295
you'll never work a day
in your life.

07:47.425 --> 07:50.470
Okay,
bring in Test 15.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.138
Initiating suit power-up.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.223
Clear.

07:56.101 --> 07:57.143
Promising.

08:02.107 --> 08:03.733
The exo suit
is performing way beyond

08:03.733 --> 08:04.943
what we expected, Jiuming.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.782
21% increase in power.

08:12.826 --> 08:13.910
Not bad, huh?

08:13.910 --> 08:14.994
So cool.

08:18.915 --> 08:21.000
I can't wait to use these
in the trench.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.755
Hi.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.090
What's up favourite niece?

08:27.090 --> 08:28.133
I'm supposed
to tell you not to be

08:28.133 --> 08:29.551
late for the party tonight.

08:29.551 --> 08:31.970
Of course.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.516
-  Maybe 25. Hmm?
- Okay.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.768
I mean it,
don't be late!

08:48.403 --> 08:50.029
I cannot believe
you got this far in life

08:50.029 --> 08:51.948
without knowing
how to tie a tie.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.826
First, let's not overstate
how far I've gotten in life.

08:54.826 --> 08:58.288
Second, never involved wearing
a monkey suit.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.956
- Perfect. You look great.
- Thanks.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.459
Ah. Maybe this is the start
of something.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.753
Don't count on it.

09:08.673 --> 09:09.466
Hi.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.055
That guy look familiar
to you?

09:16.055 --> 09:16.931
No.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.311
-  I don't like him.
- You don't like anyone.

09:21.311 --> 09:22.812
I like you.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.481
That's 'cause I save
your life all the time...

09:24.481 --> 09:25.774
I buy you beers
and I back you up

09:25.774 --> 09:27.108
in bar fights.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.985
It's 'cause
you're a special guy.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.820
You're both special.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.448
- Wish me luck.
-  Good luck.

09:33.448 --> 09:34.616
Thanks for the money.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.034
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:36.034 --> 09:37.660
welcome to
the 10th anniversary

09:37.660 --> 09:39.454
of the Oceanic Institute.

09:39.454 --> 09:41.247
I'm Hilary Driscoll.

09:41.247 --> 09:44.209
Thank you for coming tonight,
and for joining me

09:44.209 --> 09:47.712
in funding
this incredible work.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.256
Stop. Don't fidget.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.509
Why exactly do I have to be

09:52.509 --> 09:54.219
up here anyway?

09:54.219 --> 09:55.720
'Cause you're a team player.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.014
Great.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.601
Please give a warm welcome

10:01.601 --> 10:03.812
to the director
of the Institute...

10:04.938 --> 10:06.606
...Zhang Jiuming.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.569
Thank you, Hilary.

10:15.323 --> 10:19.077
As the great
poet Song Lian said...

10:19.077 --> 10:22.247
"Man is limited
only by his imagination."

10:23.414 --> 10:27.252
My father named me Jiuming,

10:27.252 --> 10:30.004
which means ocean

10:30.004 --> 10:31.589
or abyss.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.927
My father and my sister

10:35.927 --> 10:38.054
spent their lives
studying the ocean.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.682
It wasn't until

10:40.682 --> 10:42.767
they were both gone
that I began to wonder

10:42.767 --> 10:45.603
what my purpose was.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.564
But through Suyin's daughter Meiying,

10:47.564 --> 10:49.315
I saw that there was a future.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.569
I merged
my father's research institute

10:52.569 --> 10:54.654
with my company

10:55.989 --> 10:57.699
to carry forward

10:57.699 --> 11:00.827
the spirit of exploring
the unknown in their honor.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.292
To mark
this tenth anniversary,

11:07.292 --> 11:10.712
I want to introduce you all
to someone very special.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.263
Her name is Haiqi.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.640
She is the world's
only megalodon in captivity.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.685
We found her injured as a pup.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.395
Thanks to Haiqi, we've learned
a tremendous amount

11:27.395 --> 11:28.855
about the megalodons

11:28.855 --> 11:31.858
as well as the trench
where they live.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.902
Thanks
to the generous donations

11:33.902 --> 11:35.737
from our supporters,

11:35.737 --> 11:38.072
we have been able
to create the technology

11:38.072 --> 11:40.074
to pass through
the thermocline,

11:40.074 --> 11:42.952
a thermal layer
of freezing cold water

11:42.952 --> 11:45.830
that separates Haiqi's world
from ours

11:45.830 --> 11:49.918
and into a trench 6,000 meters
below sea level.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.045
Thanks to you,
we have the ability

11:52.045 --> 11:54.005
to go further
than ever before.

11:54.005 --> 11:58.009
Love the ocean
and protect the ocean.

11:58.009 --> 11:59.093
Thank you

12:00.887 --> 12:04.557
And thank you. Zhang Jiuming.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.476
So, thank you all

12:06.476 --> 12:11.022
for being part of protecting
this incredible ecosystem.

12:12.315 --> 12:13.524
Thank you for coming.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.152
Do you think
there are more creatures

12:16.152 --> 12:17.111
to be discovered down there?

12:17.862 --> 12:19.322
There has to be.

12:19.322 --> 12:20.782
Who wants to get a selfie

12:20.782 --> 12:22.533
with the man

12:22.533 --> 12:24.827
who fought a megalodon
and lived to tell the tale?

12:24.827 --> 12:26.537
We give you,
ladies and gentlemen,

12:26.537 --> 12:28.373
Jonas Taylor.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.291
- There he is! There he is.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.254
I know this was your idea.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.423
- I'm gonna kill you.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.175
Smile and pretend you love it.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.344
Go on, give him a hug.
Give him a tickle.

12:43.054 --> 12:44.347
Oh, he loves people.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.611
I wanna go
to Mana One with you.

12:58.611 --> 12:59.988
I want to dive the trench.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.156
No.

13:03.324 --> 13:04.283
Sorry, Meiying.

13:05.076 --> 13:06.536
Why not?

13:06.536 --> 13:09.497
Mom was diving all the time
at my age.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.457
Not to 25,000 feet.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.752
Saying it's too dangerous?

13:14.752 --> 13:15.878
Too dangerous for you.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.424
But not dangerous.

13:19.424 --> 13:22.760
In psychology, they call
that "cognitive dissonance."

13:22.760 --> 13:26.639
In the real world,
they call it "parenting."

13:26.639 --> 13:28.141
You need to start
taking me seriously

13:28.141 --> 13:29.434
as a scientist.

13:29.434 --> 13:32.145
- You're 14.
- Exactly.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.188
I know every system
on Mana One,

13:34.188 --> 13:35.940
every dive protocol

13:35.940 --> 13:37.734
and every animal
we've seen down there.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.903
Hey, look.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.321
You can come to Mana One.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.949
To observe the dive.

13:46.743 --> 13:47.869
And that's it.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.247
Jiuming is swimming
with the meg.

13:52.749 --> 13:53.750
Uncle.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.794
Haiqi's vitals
are elevated.

13:56.794 --> 13:59.213
Be careful,
she's definitely aware of you.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.552
Why are you swimming

14:04.552 --> 14:05.887
with the meg, Jiuming?

14:05.887 --> 14:08.139
I'm conducting an experiment.

14:08.139 --> 14:10.016
Is the experiment
"Do I taste good?"

14:12.685 --> 14:14.020
Uncle, are you crazy?

14:14.020 --> 14:15.730
It's okay.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.690
I've been training Haiqi
since she was a pup.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.443
A meg is not trainable, Jiuming.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.320
But if you wanna be eaten

14:22.320 --> 14:24.864
in front of your niece,
go ahead.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.116
Fifty bucks says
this is gonna end badly.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.618
I'll take that action.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.411
I am all in
for team shark.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.997
What? You can't bet
on a shark, man.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.332
That's bad karma.

14:34.332 --> 14:36.375
Come on, guys, focus.
That's not cool.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.211
Jiuming...

14:38.211 --> 14:39.587
I'd like
to respectfully suggest

14:39.587 --> 14:41.255
that this is truly
a terrible idea.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.633
Megs and humanity
were never meant to mix.

14:45.093 --> 14:47.512
Haiqi and I
have a special bond.

14:47.512 --> 14:48.930
Watch this.

14:51.015 --> 14:53.810
One click to come.
Two clicks to go.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.717
Whoa.
I think she's looking at us.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.270
You see?

15:37.270 --> 15:40.606
She's coming around.
Heart rate is up.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.650
- Moving in fast.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.406
Four hundred meters.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.540
Slowly, slowly.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.502
Jiuming,
she's not responding.

16:01.502 --> 16:02.587
Come on, Haiqi.

16:02.587 --> 16:03.629
Two hundred meters.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.384
- One hundred meters.

16:08.384 --> 16:09.760
Jiuming, move.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.637
It's too late.
She's coming in too fast.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.097
Fifty meters.

16:14.015 --> 16:15.683
Pull the cord.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.143
Twenty meters.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.644
Jiuming,
get out of there!

16:18.644 --> 16:19.854
-  Uncle, no!

16:25.610 --> 16:26.736
Did it get him?

16:26.736 --> 16:28.487
I don't know.
I couldn't watch.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.489
I don't see him.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.784
I knew this was a bad idea.

16:39.790 --> 16:40.833
Total success.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.213
Uncle! Are you crazy?

16:45.213 --> 16:46.464
It's all right,
I'm good.

16:46.464 --> 16:48.090
Huh?

16:48.090 --> 16:50.009
That was exciting, huh?

16:52.470 --> 16:54.347
I can't figure out
what's wrong with her.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.599
She's been acting strangely
all week.

16:56.599 --> 16:59.185
You can clickety-click
all you want.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.103
The problem is
that it's a meg.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.480
And you're a snack.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.065
-  Yeah.

17:04.065 --> 17:07.193
For the record, you scared
the hell out of Meiying.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.569
You're one to talk.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.488
What were you doing
on that ship?

17:10.488 --> 17:13.532
Actually, don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.

17:14.659 --> 17:15.826
Well, the Institute's mandate

17:15.826 --> 17:18.287
is to protect the oceans, right?

17:18.287 --> 17:21.749
We can't be a part
of any illegal activity.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.209
Oh, I abhor lawlessness.

17:23.209 --> 17:24.919
Oh, good.

17:24.919 --> 17:26.754
Especially the illegal dumping
of radioactive waste.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.716
You're taking
bigger and bigger risks

17:30.716 --> 17:32.051
each time you go out.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.011
Well, I guess
we both know about that.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.098
It's not the same.

17:37.098 --> 17:38.474
With me,

17:38.474 --> 17:40.226
there's a calculation
of risks.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.021
Not that I see.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.911
Do you miss your mom,
big fish?

18:01.497 --> 18:03.874
-  Doctor Howard.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.501
Are you ready for Mana One?

18:05.501 --> 18:09.797
Yes, whenever you're ready?

18:09.797 --> 18:13.134
These new suits will let us
travel anywhere and at
any depth underwater.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.219
Say.

18:17.555 --> 18:18.973
- What?

18:18.973 --> 18:20.641
No worries, no worries.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.692
Mom and Grandpa
talked about you all the time.

18:31.569 --> 18:33.029
Nothing good I suppose.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.072
Wanna guess?

18:38.242 --> 18:40.494
See this scar?

18:40.494 --> 18:43.706
When I was 11
my father was busy in the lab.

18:43.706 --> 18:46.500
So I snuck out to swim with my
friends on the rocky shores...

18:46.500 --> 18:49.378
and had to get nine stitches
as a result of it.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.213
When I returned home my father
taught me a real lesson.

18:53.007 --> 18:53.841
Grandpa?

18:53.841 --> 18:55.676
Of course.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.553
He was kind to you
because you're
his granddaughter,

18:57.553 --> 19:00.598
but he was tough on me.

19:00.598 --> 19:05.728
So after college,
I started a company.

19:05.728 --> 19:09.190
I wanted to get away from him.

19:09.190 --> 19:12.693
I hadn't had any contact
with your grandfather
for many years.

19:12.693 --> 19:16.280
Then he asked your mum
to bring me this calligraphy.

19:16.280 --> 19:19.116
"Dragon travelling
across the Four Seas."

19:19.116 --> 19:21.952
I thought it was
a form of ridicule...

19:21.952 --> 19:26.665
but I came to realize that
he wanted me to
find my own way.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.504
Like the dragon...

19:31.504 --> 19:34.799
I hope you can find
your own fate.

19:34.799 --> 19:36.842
Ground crew,
we're approaching Mana One.

19:36.842 --> 19:39.178
Hey,
Rigas. Good to have you back.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.930
I missed you guys.

19:40.930 --> 19:41.680
Are you ready
to do some diving?

19:42.807 --> 19:43.724
You know it.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.456
Morning, everyone.

20:48.456 --> 20:49.915
Let's get this show underwater.

20:49.915 --> 20:50.875
Dive 1 and Dive 2,

20:50.875 --> 20:52.293
descend to 25,000 feet.

20:52.293 --> 20:54.211
We're exploring Area 19.

20:54.211 --> 20:56.380
Collecting rock samples
and logging any new species.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.716
Diving in T-minus 20 minutes.

20:58.716 --> 21:00.509
All eyes open

21:00.509 --> 21:02.511
for a straightforward
sweep and scan. The usual.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.597
Yeah.
There's no usual down there.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.891
- System's up.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.060
What's with
all these toys you have

21:10.060 --> 21:11.562
hanging around your console,
Lance?

21:12.855 --> 21:14.982
They're not toys,
they're figurines.

21:14.982 --> 21:17.401
They are
definitely toys, Lance.

21:17.401 --> 21:18.486
- Thank you.

21:25.618 --> 21:26.744
Ready for the drop, guys?

21:50.184 --> 21:53.312
So, are you and Sal, like,
Comic-Con guys or what?

21:54.563 --> 21:56.690
Uh, absolutely right. Yeah.

21:56.690 --> 21:59.068
Do you, um, dress up?

21:59.068 --> 22:00.694
Uh, yeah.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.446
Don't get him started,
unless you want to see

22:02.446 --> 22:03.864
a million photographs.

22:03.864 --> 22:05.908
Oh, yes, please.

22:05.908 --> 22:07.451
Stay focused, guys.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.747
Passing 17,000.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.415
Telemetry's good.

22:16.460 --> 22:19.338
It's a beautiful day
in the neighborhood.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.387
Passing 18,000 feet.

22:26.387 --> 22:28.889
All systems nominal.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.474
Looking good, team.

22:30.474 --> 22:31.642
Let's pull up the grids
we're gonna map today.

22:31.642 --> 22:33.435
Area 19.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.062
When are we going to
look at something different?

22:35.062 --> 22:36.021
You know,
there's like 100 more

22:36.021 --> 22:37.314
sectors to explore.

22:37.314 --> 22:39.567
Jonas,
can you confirm O2 levels?

22:39.567 --> 22:42.653
Consumption is 11%
over mission spec.

22:42.653 --> 22:45.114
Guess Rigas is nervous.

22:45.114 --> 22:46.907
More like
you're a mouth breather.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.450
- He totally is.

22:48.450 --> 22:49.618
Can feel the breeze
from over here.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.036
Yeah.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.998
Firstly, it's called
a deviated septum.

22:53.998 --> 22:56.750
Second, I distinctly remember
deviating it

22:56.750 --> 22:58.210
while saving
your ungrateful ass

22:58.210 --> 23:00.921
from a 70-foot megalodon.

23:00.921 --> 23:04.216
Passing 20,000 feet.
Approaching the thermocline.

23:07.636 --> 23:09.597
Checking O2 lines
and tank pressure.

23:09.597 --> 23:11.056
Well,
if there was a leak,

23:11.056 --> 23:12.224
there would be
a fluctuation on the readings.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.101
I'm not seeing anything here.

23:14.101 --> 23:15.811
Check the pressure
on the auxiliary O2 tanks.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.771
Okay, I'll check again.

23:17.771 --> 23:20.107
That's not the problem.

23:20.107 --> 23:21.734
Uh, Jonas?

23:23.902 --> 23:25.779
Meiying?

23:25.779 --> 23:27.072
What the hell are you doing?

23:27.072 --> 23:28.157
You gotta be kidding me.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.745
I see that you're angry.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.788
But I believe
that this is a reasonable

23:34.788 --> 23:36.290
and responsible decision.

23:36.290 --> 23:37.416
Stop the dive.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.794
Full stop.

23:40.794 --> 23:43.797
But before you start yelling,
can I just say...

23:43.797 --> 23:45.257
I did all kinds
of stupid things

23:45.257 --> 23:47.009
when I was 14.

23:47.009 --> 23:48.844
And look how I turned out.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.346
We're surfacing.

23:50.346 --> 23:51.889
But I don't see
what the problem is.

23:51.889 --> 23:54.308
This is your 26th trench dive
without incident.

23:54.308 --> 23:56.185
Subs have electric
predator countermeasures,

23:56.185 --> 23:57.603
and emergency dive suits.

23:57.603 --> 23:58.979
Which you don't have.

23:58.979 --> 23:59.980
Actually...

24:01.899 --> 24:04.276
I packed one while you were
doing the pre-dive meeting.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.611
You know,

24:05.611 --> 24:07.363
now's maybe
a good time to, uh,

24:07.363 --> 24:10.866
sit down
and be quiet for a minute.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.451
I can do a seatbelt by myself,
you know.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.619
I know you can.

24:13.619 --> 24:14.662
Jonas.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.081
It's not your call, Jiuming.

24:17.081 --> 24:18.290
We've got company.

24:19.708 --> 24:21.377
Guys, it's a meg.

24:21.377 --> 24:22.670
-  Approaching fast.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.004
That's not possible.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.631
they can't go through
the thermocline.

24:25.631 --> 24:26.924
It's not come
from the thermocline.

24:26.924 --> 24:28.217
I'm tracking it
from the shore.

24:30.219 --> 24:32.012
Dive! Flank speed!

24:32.012 --> 24:35.099
Engaging.
Rerouting battery array.

24:35.099 --> 24:36.183
Hold on.

24:38.394 --> 24:40.104
Charging
the predator countermeasures.

24:40.104 --> 24:42.272
We'll be dead
before they're online.

24:42.272 --> 24:44.400
Thermocline's our only hope.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.943
I'm reading Haiqi's tracker.

24:47.569 --> 24:49.613
Impossible.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.240
Well,
impossible just got possible.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.866
Five hundred meters
to the thermocline.

24:52.866 --> 24:54.827
Haiqi's closing fast.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.078
One hundred meters.

24:56.078 --> 24:57.121
She's right above us.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.916
Come on, come on!

25:00.916 --> 25:02.876
Entering the thermocline.

25:02.876 --> 25:04.294
Dive 1, Dive 2.

25:04.294 --> 25:05.921
Switch to low-frequency light.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.506
you don't want to attract
any more megs.

25:07.506 --> 25:08.674
I've lost her.

25:08.674 --> 25:10.092
She can't follow us through.

25:10.092 --> 25:11.468
Can she?

25:11.468 --> 25:13.220
Going dark.

25:13.220 --> 25:15.222
I've never crossed
the thermocline at 60 knots.

25:17.599 --> 25:19.810
Careful. You don't want
to burn out the engines.

25:19.810 --> 25:22.396
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
break the pretty toys.

25:31.739 --> 25:32.698
Yes.

25:36.577 --> 25:37.870
She's still on us.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.079
Thirty seconds

25:39.079 --> 25:41.331
- for the countermeasures.
- Evasive.

25:41.331 --> 25:42.624
She must have followed
our heat signature.

26:02.728 --> 26:03.812
How did your pet shark

26:03.812 --> 26:05.230
get down here, Jiuming?

26:05.230 --> 26:06.815
She must have escaped.

26:06.815 --> 26:08.650
How did that happen?

26:08.650 --> 26:10.110
Predator countermeasures active.

26:11.862 --> 26:13.280
Proximity alert.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.406
Megs.

26:17.534 --> 26:19.328
No way.

26:29.713 --> 26:33.175
That's the biggest meg
I've ever seen.

26:33.175 --> 26:35.969
Biggest meg
anyone's ever seen.

26:35.969 --> 26:37.763
That's gotta be
the apex predator.

26:42.017 --> 26:44.770
Incredible. Megs are solitary.

26:44.770 --> 26:46.271
It's like
they're being called.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.775
I'm changing the dive plan.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.485
We have to see
what they're up to.

26:51.485 --> 26:53.403
And what about Meiying?

26:53.403 --> 26:54.780
Well, I vote we go.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.908
I wasn't asking you.

26:57.908 --> 26:59.910
Oxygen
reserves are at maximum.

26:59.910 --> 27:02.746
Predator countermeasures
are deployed.

27:02.746 --> 27:04.790
Right now
we are perfectly safe.

27:04.790 --> 27:07.626
Right now, yeah.

27:07.626 --> 27:10.462
If I see anything dangerous,
I'm pulling the plug.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.672
Mac, we're changing

27:11.672 --> 27:12.965
the mission profile.

27:12.965 --> 27:15.342
Proceeding on heading 227.

27:15.342 --> 27:16.593
Now, they're already
off mission.

27:16.593 --> 27:17.928
They need to stay on course.

27:17.928 --> 27:19.263
Jonas,
you're going way outside

27:19.263 --> 27:21.098
the sector we have
already mapped.

27:21.098 --> 27:22.474
This is
an exploration mission.

27:22.474 --> 27:23.892
Let's explore.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.144
Copy that.

27:26.144 --> 27:27.229
- Eyes open, watch your backs.

27:27.229 --> 27:28.689
Really, Mac?

27:28.689 --> 27:30.858
So, we're gonna follow
some giant sharks

27:30.858 --> 27:32.943
to a unknown sector?

27:32.943 --> 27:34.987
Man...

27:34.987 --> 27:37.155
This some dumbass shit,
mark my words.

27:41.702 --> 27:43.912
Entering sector 21.

28:00.846 --> 28:03.056
Commencing geographical scan.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.059
It's so beautiful.

28:08.312 --> 28:10.355
Your mum loved this place
more than anything.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.609
I'm glad
I finally get to see it.

28:15.903 --> 28:17.738
Don't get used to it.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.656
You're grounded
for the rest of your life.

28:21.450 --> 28:22.743
I love you, too.

28:24.620 --> 28:27.414
Haiqi
400 meters ahead and holding.

28:27.414 --> 28:28.916
Where are we going now?

28:28.916 --> 28:30.584
Into the unknown.

28:30.584 --> 28:33.378
That's what we came for.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.130
I've got
Haiqi's tracker ahead.

28:35.130 --> 28:36.840
Looks like she's circling.

28:48.769 --> 28:50.312
Look up.

28:50.312 --> 28:52.522
It's some
instinctual gathering.

28:52.522 --> 28:53.899
Incredible.

28:55.609 --> 28:57.694
They're here to mate.

28:57.694 --> 29:00.489
This is why Haiqi has been
acting strangely.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.950
Oh, great.
More megs.

29:10.248 --> 29:11.833
The scanner's detecting
an abnormal structure.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.468
No way.

29:21.468 --> 29:23.136
Is that a wreck?

29:26.431 --> 29:28.767
It's some kind of
sea floor station.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.394
What could they be
doing down here?

29:34.648 --> 29:36.024
Rigas, run all spectrums.

29:37.651 --> 29:39.111
No, that's no wreck.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.530
I'm getting
heat signatures off it.

29:41.530 --> 29:43.073
Just can't see what's inside.

29:43.073 --> 29:44.449
Multiple airlocks,

29:44.449 --> 29:45.784
power generation.

29:45.784 --> 29:48.203
The resources needed
is staggering.

29:50.247 --> 29:52.624
Who would even have
that technology?

29:54.418 --> 29:56.253
Sonar says
there's something above us.

29:56.253 --> 29:58.380
It looks like a submarine.

29:58.380 --> 30:00.090
Let's take a look.

30:00.090 --> 30:01.299
Charges set.

30:01.299 --> 30:03.010
Priming zone for detonation.

30:03.010 --> 30:05.554
Come on.
We need to blow this ridge.

30:05.554 --> 30:07.472
Yeah, okay, okay.

30:07.472 --> 30:09.391
We don't wanna be down here
any longer than needs be.

30:11.768 --> 30:13.895
Yeah, well,
this is the only place

30:13.895 --> 30:15.397
to mine this stuff.

30:17.107 --> 30:18.942
Slow and steady.

30:18.942 --> 30:20.485
Hey, Montes.

30:20.485 --> 30:21.528
Why do you get to stay
in the submarine?

30:23.030 --> 30:25.407
It's good
to be the king.

30:25.407 --> 30:27.159
Incoming object detected.

30:29.953 --> 30:31.538
Zoom in 400%.

30:42.424 --> 30:45.135
Mana One crew is below us.

30:45.135 --> 30:47.971
There's no way
they haven't seen the station.

30:47.971 --> 30:49.681
What are we gonna do?

30:49.681 --> 30:52.017
I'm arming
the explosives right now.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.435
You have to get out.

30:53.435 --> 30:55.353
What? Wait, no,
you can't do that.

30:55.353 --> 30:57.189
There isn't time.
You know there isn't time.

30:57.189 --> 30:58.899
It will take ten minutes
to get clear.

31:00.275 --> 31:01.193
Montes!

31:08.283 --> 31:09.743
Sorry, guys.

31:09.743 --> 31:11.328
Montes!
Montes, don't do it!

31:15.165 --> 31:16.166
What was that?

31:18.627 --> 31:20.212
Landslide!

31:20.212 --> 31:22.297
I can't get ahead of it.
I'm gonna have to go through.

31:56.873 --> 31:58.166
Guys?
What's happening?

31:58.166 --> 31:59.918
I'm reading
a thermocline breach.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.087
Something's ripped
a giant hole in it.

32:13.390 --> 32:15.392
Rerouting the thrusters.
This is all we've got.

32:21.106 --> 32:22.691
Vertical control is down.

32:23.775 --> 32:24.985
Hydraulics are non-responsive.

32:28.864 --> 32:29.865
We're pinned.

32:31.867 --> 32:32.826
Coming in.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.746
-  Hold us steady.
-  Yeah.

32:39.124 --> 32:42.586
Jiuming.
Sixty degrees down.

32:42.586 --> 32:44.045
Two feet forward.

32:47.716 --> 32:48.675
Jiuming!

32:58.018 --> 32:58.977
Go, go, go!

33:00.395 --> 33:01.771
Full thrust! Full thrust!

33:13.575 --> 33:14.451
Jiuming!

33:16.036 --> 33:16.828
No!

33:28.048 --> 33:29.466
There's no telemetry.

33:31.635 --> 33:34.179
Dive 1, Dive 2. Do you copy?

33:35.805 --> 33:37.474
Dive 1, Dive 2. Do you copy?

33:39.601 --> 33:41.937
We've got nothing here.

33:41.937 --> 33:45.774
Keep trying, DJ. Jess,
prep the rescue sub. Stat.

33:45.774 --> 33:47.901
- Ugh, what happened?
- I don't know.

33:49.986 --> 33:51.738
How do we know
if they're still alive?

33:51.738 --> 33:53.156
Prep the rescue vehicle.

33:55.909 --> 33:58.370
Dive 1, Dive 2.
Do you copy?

33:59.162 --> 34:00.330
Come on, Jonas.

34:02.749 --> 34:04.209
Meiying.

34:06.294 --> 34:07.504
Meiying.

34:09.256 --> 34:10.257
- Meiying.

34:10.257 --> 34:11.800
What happened?

34:11.800 --> 34:12.968
Took a nasty hit.

34:14.970 --> 34:16.096
Uncle Jiuming?

34:17.013 --> 34:18.640
Where's Uncle Jiuming?

34:18.640 --> 34:21.184
- Where is he?
- We can't raise him.

34:21.184 --> 34:23.979
Hey. We work the problems
one by one.

34:25.188 --> 34:26.231
We do what's in front of us...

34:27.482 --> 34:28.566
...and then we do
the next thing.

34:29.943 --> 34:31.236
We're gonna be okay.

34:32.779 --> 34:34.322
Mac!

34:34.322 --> 34:36.616
The rescue sub isn't working.

34:36.616 --> 34:39.035
The battery array
was deliberately shorted out.

34:39.035 --> 34:40.370
It looks like sabotage.

34:40.370 --> 34:41.454
How's that possible?

34:41.454 --> 34:42.872
This isn't a secure area.

34:42.872 --> 34:44.207
There are 30 people
who work here.

34:44.207 --> 34:45.917
Well, how long to fix it?

34:45.917 --> 34:48.378
It's the control boards, Mac.
There is no fixing it.

34:51.756 --> 34:53.258
Try it now.

34:53.258 --> 34:54.551
What's our status?

34:54.551 --> 34:55.635
No comms, no heat.

34:56.803 --> 34:58.513
We're losing air fast.

34:58.513 --> 34:59.681
This isn't working.

34:59.681 --> 35:01.099
Flood in my extra O2.

35:02.684 --> 35:03.810
Already done.

35:03.810 --> 35:06.104
I've got one last idea.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.106
Route the power
through the heating cell.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.531
I got Dive 1.
Mac, I got Dive 1.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.700
- Jonas?

35:18.700 --> 35:20.327
Good to hear your voice, Mac.

35:20.327 --> 35:22.579
Not as good as it is
to hear yours, brother.

35:22.579 --> 35:24.080
Talk to me.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.999
It ain't good.

35:25.999 --> 35:28.668
Almost every system is down,
and we're losing air fast.

35:28.668 --> 35:31.588
We'll get into
the emergency dive suits...

35:31.588 --> 35:32.922
and we're gonna need
a ride up.

35:34.549 --> 35:35.342
Jonas...

35:36.384 --> 35:37.635
it's not gonna be possible.

35:39.012 --> 35:40.513
What are you talking about?

35:40.513 --> 35:42.390
The battery array.
It shorted out

35:42.390 --> 35:44.351
the control board
in the rescue sub.

35:44.351 --> 35:45.852
We're investigating it now.

35:49.314 --> 35:50.231
Jonas?

35:51.608 --> 35:52.692
Jonas, can you hear me?

35:54.611 --> 35:56.029
Jonas, we can't get to you.

35:59.949 --> 36:00.950
We're gonna walk.

36:02.952 --> 36:04.371
We're gonna walk back
across the trench.

36:04.371 --> 36:06.456
Make it into
that sea floor station.

36:06.456 --> 36:07.999
And we're gonna get inside.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.876
And then we're gonna get
to the surface.

36:09.876 --> 36:12.379
Those suits have
two hours of air tops.

36:12.379 --> 36:14.881
They're only designed
for brief extravehicular work.

36:14.881 --> 36:17.300
We'll go slow and steady.
They'll hold.

36:17.300 --> 36:19.177
It's three kilometers.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.096
You'll be defenseless
out there.

36:21.096 --> 36:22.931
What do you want from me, Mac?

36:22.931 --> 36:25.558
This is what we got, and this
is what we're gonna do.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.646
Half our team is dead,

36:29.646 --> 36:31.314
and I'm not losing
the other half.

36:37.278 --> 36:39.864
Beginning suit initialization.

36:39.864 --> 36:41.908
Joint actuators functioning.

36:41.908 --> 36:45.370
Ultrasonic signal
communications online.

36:45.370 --> 36:47.205
Initialization complete.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.710
Abandoning Dive 1, Mac.

36:54.129 --> 36:55.171
The radios won't relay
to the surface,

36:55.171 --> 36:56.756
so we're going dark.

36:56.756 --> 36:58.800
Talk to you on the other side.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.135
Godspeed, Jonas.

37:06.933 --> 37:08.768
Emergency escape initiated.

37:54.355 --> 37:55.440
Hey. Whoa!

37:57.066 --> 37:58.109
Almost killed you.

37:59.152 --> 38:00.278
The hell are you doing?

38:00.278 --> 38:02.030
Saving your ass.

38:02.030 --> 38:03.740
And walking back
to that station.

38:05.492 --> 38:07.160
What are you doing?

38:07.160 --> 38:08.828
Saving your ass.

38:08.828 --> 38:11.247
And walking back
to that station.

38:11.247 --> 38:12.832
- Don't have much time.
- Let's get going.

38:15.502 --> 38:16.878
- Jiu.
- Oh.

38:18.546 --> 38:20.548
Uncle, I thought you--

38:20.548 --> 38:22.425
You're not going
to get rid of me that easily.

38:24.511 --> 38:25.595
Hey.

38:25.595 --> 38:27.639
Hey. Let me check.

38:27.639 --> 38:28.723
Air left...

38:28.723 --> 38:30.308
Hey, you need to calm down

38:30.308 --> 38:31.809
or you're gonna
run out of oxygen, Lance.

38:31.809 --> 38:33.603
I don't think i can.

38:33.603 --> 38:35.355
Think of it as cosplay.

38:35.355 --> 38:38.775
Or we could
be paintballing.

38:38.775 --> 38:40.610
Like the ultimate
team-building exercise.

38:40.610 --> 38:42.028
We need
to cover distance

38:42.028 --> 38:43.863
while the megs
are still occupied.

38:43.863 --> 38:45.448
Three
kilometers to destination.

38:45.448 --> 38:47.325
Away from the megs
is fine by me.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.035
We're a strong group.

38:49.035 --> 38:50.286
We can do this.

38:52.789 --> 38:54.624
Amazing.

38:54.624 --> 38:57.585
Lighting courtesy
of Mother Nature.

38:57.585 --> 38:59.045
It's incredible,

38:59.045 --> 39:01.172
there are new species
all around us.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.466
Hey. Look.

39:03.466 --> 39:05.301
Look at this.
It's beautiful.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.140
Hello,
my little biolum--

39:12.892 --> 39:15.186
There's a snake!
There's a snake!

39:15.186 --> 39:17.188
Get this monster off my head!

39:22.235 --> 39:23.820
No touching stuff.

39:23.820 --> 39:25.863
He started it.

39:28.449 --> 39:29.701
Everyone
clear the station.

39:29.701 --> 39:31.327
DJ, what's our time on Jonas?

39:31.327 --> 39:33.162
Forty-one minutes
since they went dark.

39:33.162 --> 39:34.539
At best,
it'll take another hour

39:34.539 --> 39:35.707
for them
to cover the distance.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.542
Listen up.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.586
We know there's some kind of
rogue operation in the trench.

39:39.586 --> 39:40.795
Now, some bastard's
got his fingers

39:40.795 --> 39:42.297
in our operation here.

39:42.297 --> 39:44.340
That sub was
definitely sabotaged,

39:44.340 --> 39:45.925
so we've got a mole
on the station.

39:45.925 --> 39:48.344
DJ, I want you to pull
all surveillance footage

39:48.344 --> 39:50.513
from the sub bay
for the last 24 hours.

39:50.513 --> 39:52.724
Jess, run the personnel files
on the crew,

39:52.724 --> 39:54.726
look for anything suspect.

39:54.726 --> 39:56.060
We're gonna get
these sons of bitches,

39:56.060 --> 39:57.812
but we have to watch
our own backs.

39:57.812 --> 40:00.815
One of us mans the DCC
at all times, understood?

40:00.815 --> 40:01.858
Yes.

40:05.987 --> 40:08.448
Is it just me,

40:08.448 --> 40:10.533
or does walking
three kilometers underwater

40:10.533 --> 40:12.285
sound like hard work?

40:12.285 --> 40:14.329
It certainly wasn't
on my to-do list.

40:17.832 --> 40:20.335
Baby octopi.

40:20.335 --> 40:22.503
So many colors.
That's incredible.

40:26.299 --> 40:27.592
Anybody wanna play
a game?

40:27.592 --> 40:28.676
A game?

40:28.676 --> 40:30.261
This isn't a game.

40:30.261 --> 40:32.764
She means to keep
our minds occupied.

40:32.764 --> 40:35.642
Right now, my mind is
pretty damn occupied.

40:56.829 --> 40:59.207
There's a... there's a...
It's...

40:59.791 --> 41:00.917
Lance?

41:00.917 --> 41:02.627
What was it?

41:02.627 --> 41:04.629
-  I didn't see.
-  Where's Lance?

41:04.629 --> 41:05.963
Is it a meg?

41:08.424 --> 41:10.551
Some... something's
happened to him. I know it.

41:10.551 --> 41:11.678
Lance?

41:15.431 --> 41:18.351
No. Oh, no.

41:18.351 --> 41:19.977
We have to keep moving.

41:19.977 --> 41:21.729
No, we... We can't just
leave him out there.

41:21.729 --> 41:23.147
We need to find him!

41:23.147 --> 41:24.565
Please, Jiuming.

41:24.565 --> 41:25.733
- I'm sorry.

41:26.651 --> 41:27.527
He's gone.

41:30.321 --> 41:33.116
Rigas, cover our six.
Shoot anything that moves.

41:35.201 --> 41:37.161
You bet your ass I will.

41:53.678 --> 41:55.555
Comms online.

41:58.307 --> 42:00.601
What happened to you?

42:00.601 --> 42:03.354
The Mana One crew
stumbled upon our station.

42:03.354 --> 42:05.231
I took them out
with a landslide.

42:05.231 --> 42:07.817
Okay, this is...
this is out of control.

42:07.817 --> 42:09.527
You authorized me

42:09.527 --> 42:12.530
to do whatever's necessary
to protect our operation.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.157
No.

42:15.032 --> 42:16.451
They're not dead.

42:16.451 --> 42:20.621
They are walking right now
to the station.

42:20.621 --> 42:21.873
If they get there,

42:22.749 --> 42:24.459
we are screwed.

42:26.919 --> 42:28.421
There's still
a kilometer to go,

42:28.421 --> 42:29.756
straight through
that valley,

42:29.756 --> 42:31.215
and we don't have

42:31.215 --> 42:33.134
the bioluminescence
to cover us.

42:33.134 --> 42:34.427
We're going to be
totally exposed out there.

42:34.427 --> 42:36.053
We don't have a choice.

42:36.053 --> 42:38.473
We only have enough air
to go straight through.

42:38.473 --> 42:42.310
Let's keep
our lights on low spectrum.

42:42.310 --> 42:44.228
Yeah. We don't want
to attract the megs.

42:44.228 --> 42:46.981
One kilometer to destination.

42:46.981 --> 42:48.608
-  O2 check?

42:48.608 --> 42:50.193
65%.

42:50.193 --> 42:51.277
50.

42:51.277 --> 42:53.488
26%.

42:53.488 --> 42:55.031
It's not gonna be enough.

42:55.031 --> 42:56.616
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.

42:56.616 --> 42:58.910
Look at me, okay? Focus, okay?

42:58.910 --> 43:01.496
You can do this.
Remember the training.

43:03.122 --> 43:04.832
Anything on sonar?

43:04.832 --> 43:07.168
I got something,
right at the edge of my range.

43:08.211 --> 43:09.921
Keeps going in and out.

43:13.090 --> 43:14.258
Stalking us.

43:23.059 --> 43:24.352
Proximity alert.

43:26.062 --> 43:27.480
-  What is it?

43:33.402 --> 43:34.612
It's just
a shoal of fish.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.824
Stay calm, everyone.

43:37.824 --> 43:39.575
-  Are you okay?
- Yeah.

43:39.575 --> 43:40.701
Keep moving.

43:43.621 --> 43:44.831
Ayo, Mac.

43:44.831 --> 43:46.415
We got jack
on the security footage.

43:46.415 --> 43:47.625
Somebody deleted it.

43:47.625 --> 43:48.709
For the sub bay?

43:48.709 --> 43:50.670
For the whole damn station.

43:50.670 --> 43:52.421
They're good, but they don't
know everything.

43:52.421 --> 43:54.590
There's a satellite uplink
with an encrypted backup.

43:54.590 --> 43:56.008
I'm gonna go
to the server room,

43:56.008 --> 43:57.385
see if I can pull it down.

43:57.385 --> 43:58.886
Time?

43:58.886 --> 44:00.304
One hour, 50.
They'll be out of air soon.

44:00.304 --> 44:02.390
I'm scanning all channels,
but nothing yet.

44:07.478 --> 44:10.398
That's it.
Maybe 400 meters.

44:15.945 --> 44:16.946
Warning.

44:16.946 --> 44:18.447
Entering oxygen reserves.

44:18.447 --> 44:20.283
You can do this.

44:20.283 --> 44:22.285
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

44:22.285 --> 44:24.036
I'm getting
a reading.

44:24.036 --> 44:25.705
Many contacts to our right.

44:27.081 --> 44:28.124
Coming in fast.

44:31.127 --> 44:32.753
What, megs?

44:32.753 --> 44:36.048
No. Smaller. Faster.

44:39.552 --> 44:41.679
Everybody make it
to the station!

44:41.679 --> 44:43.389
- Go, move!
-  Warning.

44:43.389 --> 44:45.016
- Oxygen level low.
-  Come on.

44:45.016 --> 44:45.725
-  Come on.
-  I'm out of air.

44:47.059 --> 44:48.477
They're coming
over the ridge!

44:52.773 --> 44:54.025
What are those things?

44:54.025 --> 44:55.484
It's too far.

44:55.484 --> 44:57.570
We need
to make a stand!

44:57.570 --> 44:58.738
Turn and fight!

45:12.960 --> 45:13.920
Come on!

45:17.715 --> 45:19.133
- Meiying!

45:19.133 --> 45:20.843
Help!
Shoot their head!

45:20.843 --> 45:22.136
- Meiying!
- Uncle!

45:25.097 --> 45:26.515
I've got you!

45:26.515 --> 45:28.517
Hold on!

45:28.517 --> 45:29.226
They're biting
through the suit.

45:32.438 --> 45:33.564
Meiying!

45:42.782 --> 45:44.700
No. No.

45:44.700 --> 45:46.243
Hold on, Curtis!

45:46.243 --> 45:48.245
Too many!
We don't have a chance!

46:07.098 --> 46:08.307
Everybody stay back!

46:10.226 --> 46:11.394
Keep going!

46:19.110 --> 46:20.277
Jiuming!

46:20.277 --> 46:21.570
There's no choice.

46:23.114 --> 46:24.657
You really want to die,
don't you?

46:49.598 --> 46:51.350
Gotta make it
to the airlock!

47:04.697 --> 47:05.906
Warning. Low air.

47:05.906 --> 47:07.283
It's no use

47:07.283 --> 47:08.117
- I'm holding you back.
- Low air.

47:11.954 --> 47:13.622
- It's not too far.

47:13.622 --> 47:15.166
You can make it!

47:15.166 --> 47:16.834
Warning. Low air.

47:19.170 --> 47:20.755
- Warning. Low air.

47:22.631 --> 47:23.924
Air depleted.

47:34.060 --> 47:35.811
-  Uncle!

47:35.811 --> 47:37.521
Visor failure imminent.

47:39.023 --> 47:40.107
Jiuming!

47:47.281 --> 47:49.366
Okay. We gotta go.
We don't have a choice.

47:49.366 --> 47:50.951
He's coming
back around!

47:50.951 --> 47:52.703
-  Oh, God!
-  Go, go, go!

47:55.581 --> 47:56.832
We have to do the override.

47:59.418 --> 48:01.087
Come on, hurry up.

48:01.087 --> 48:03.881
- Rigas, come on!

48:03.881 --> 48:05.091
You can do it.
Get in!

48:07.676 --> 48:10.096
- Shut the door!

48:10.096 --> 48:11.597
Curtis, you'll be okay.

48:11.597 --> 48:13.599
Suit implosion imminent.

48:13.599 --> 48:14.308
- Almost there. Almost there!
-  Oh, my God.

48:17.061 --> 48:18.354
It's gonna implode.

48:18.354 --> 48:19.730
Depressurize the room!

48:19.730 --> 48:21.482
- No, no, no.

48:21.482 --> 48:23.025
- No!

49:05.234 --> 49:07.194
Son of a bitch!

49:07.194 --> 49:08.612
I hate these things!

49:10.281 --> 49:12.116
Hey, Rigas.

49:12.116 --> 49:13.868
Let's try to keep it together.

49:15.536 --> 49:16.996
We ain't out of the woods yet.

49:45.191 --> 49:46.150
Rigas.

49:58.370 --> 49:59.830
Where is everybody?

50:15.804 --> 50:17.223
What is that smell?

50:19.016 --> 50:20.100
Divers.

50:28.817 --> 50:29.860
Nobody home.

50:31.320 --> 50:32.446
I'll cover the door.

50:38.869 --> 50:42.831
Whoever's running this
is not our friend.

50:42.831 --> 50:44.166
We need to contact
Mana One ASAP.

50:44.166 --> 50:45.459
Think you can handle it?

50:45.459 --> 50:46.794
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

50:50.422 --> 50:52.424
What is this
that they're mining?

50:52.424 --> 50:54.260
Whatever it is,
they're sending it

50:54.260 --> 50:56.262
up to the surface
with these pods.

51:02.851 --> 51:05.729
Mmm. Rare earth metals.

51:05.729 --> 51:07.314
They're used
in superconductors,

51:07.314 --> 51:10.150
aerospace
and quantum computing.

51:10.150 --> 51:13.570
This box alone
could be a billion dollars.

51:14.905 --> 51:16.573
"Billion" with a "B?"

51:16.573 --> 51:17.658
Yes.

51:17.658 --> 51:18.742
- Mana One.

51:18.742 --> 51:20.411
Jonas. Comms are live.

51:25.249 --> 51:26.542
Come in.

51:26.542 --> 51:28.335
It's Jonas. Getting this?

51:28.335 --> 51:29.628
Hey, you're alive.

51:29.628 --> 51:31.964
What's your status?

51:31.964 --> 51:34.341
We lost Lance,
Sal, and Curtis.

51:35.718 --> 51:37.011
We're at the station.

51:37.011 --> 51:39.638
It's a rogue mining operation.

51:39.638 --> 51:41.056
Is there anyone down there?

51:41.056 --> 51:42.933
Not that we've seen so far.

51:42.933 --> 51:44.393
They've infiltrated Mana One.

51:44.393 --> 51:46.437
The rescue sub was sabotaged.

51:46.437 --> 51:48.647
- By who?
- We're working on it.

51:48.647 --> 51:49.732
But check this out.

51:49.732 --> 51:51.400
I was going over the video

51:51.400 --> 51:53.736
of when you went
over that station before.

51:53.736 --> 51:55.112
Look at the north side.

51:57.948 --> 52:00.576
Looks like
emergency escape pods.

52:00.576 --> 52:02.953
It's the opposite
side from where we are.

52:18.719 --> 52:20.304
Feels dead in here.

52:20.304 --> 52:21.430
Stay close.

52:24.558 --> 52:26.018
These are my designs.

52:27.186 --> 52:28.354
How do they have this?

52:40.866 --> 52:42.159
Looks like this is it.

52:53.420 --> 52:54.546
On three.

52:54.546 --> 52:56.090
Three.

53:00.552 --> 53:01.762
-  Again.
- It's not gonna work.

53:13.399 --> 53:14.400
After you.

53:17.653 --> 53:19.988
Ah,
this is more like it.

53:19.988 --> 53:22.032
Let's crack open a pod
and get out of here.

53:24.326 --> 53:26.161
Nothing here.

53:26.161 --> 53:28.038
These controls ain't working.

53:28.038 --> 53:29.373
We need to close the hatch.

53:29.373 --> 53:30.541
On it.

53:35.129 --> 53:37.339
Guys, that wasn't me.

53:39.508 --> 53:42.052
Jonas,
now that I have you here,

53:42.052 --> 53:43.554
we need to talk candidly.

53:43.554 --> 53:45.222
I have full control
of the station,

53:45.222 --> 53:46.807
and I've locked down
this room.

53:46.807 --> 53:48.016
Jess?

53:48.016 --> 53:49.685
Your life is in my hands.

53:49.685 --> 53:50.936
What are you doing, Jess?

53:53.397 --> 53:55.774
These are your friends.

53:55.774 --> 53:57.401
They've been with you
for years.

53:57.401 --> 53:58.986
I know it hurts.

53:58.986 --> 54:00.487
And we're talking
because I'd prefer

54:00.487 --> 54:02.364
we were on the same side.

54:02.364 --> 54:04.575
All making so much money,
it ceases to have meaning.

54:04.575 --> 54:06.034
You're offering us money?

54:08.704 --> 54:10.956
Three of our friends are dead
because of you.

54:10.956 --> 54:12.875
You think
I'm gonna forget about that?

54:16.587 --> 54:19.173
No, no, no, no, no!
That's the first escape pod!

54:19.173 --> 54:20.632
Son of a bitch!

54:20.632 --> 54:24.803
Rigas?
Rigas, you can save Meiying.

54:24.803 --> 54:27.681
Take that speargun
and shoot Jonas in the heart.

54:49.495 --> 54:51.038
Don't shoot him.

55:03.926 --> 55:04.885
Do it.

55:05.636 --> 55:06.803
Go ahead.

55:09.139 --> 55:11.016
It's the only way
Meiying survives.

55:15.229 --> 55:16.313
Do it.

55:18.524 --> 55:19.483
Rigas!

55:20.943 --> 55:22.569
Do it!

55:25.280 --> 55:27.199
- Do it!
- No. I'm sorry.

55:27.199 --> 55:30.911
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I can't.
I can't. I can't.

55:38.669 --> 55:40.379
That was the last pod.

55:42.589 --> 55:44.716
I told you that wouldn't work.

55:44.716 --> 55:45.842
Put me on.

55:48.679 --> 55:50.889
Oh, sorry
it had to come to this.

55:52.099 --> 55:53.433
So...

55:53.433 --> 55:55.060
we'll be back at work
in a week,

55:55.060 --> 55:59.022
using your technology
to take whatever we want.

55:59.022 --> 56:02.568
Your institute'll be
a platform that we use

56:02.568 --> 56:05.988
to plunder the ocean
for decades.

56:05.988 --> 56:07.739
Karma will get you.

56:07.739 --> 56:08.699
And before you start whining

56:08.699 --> 56:10.117
about the ecosystem,

56:10.117 --> 56:12.119
who cares?
We'll make billions.

56:12.119 --> 56:14.538
And no one is going to see
the damage we do.

56:14.538 --> 56:15.622
Shut up!

56:17.541 --> 56:19.293
Jess,
I've already dispatched

56:19.293 --> 56:21.670
a clean-up crew to Mana One.

56:21.670 --> 56:22.796
Finish this.

56:27.384 --> 56:30.012
How do we
open the door?

56:30.012 --> 56:32.306
If we could
cut the comm link
to the surface...

56:33.432 --> 56:34.808
she couldn't control anything.

56:34.808 --> 56:36.268
But it's back
in the first room,

56:36.268 --> 56:38.312
and there's no getting through
this door.

56:38.312 --> 56:40.355
This airlock still works!

56:40.355 --> 56:42.608
Why would you go through
the airlock? There's no pod.

56:42.608 --> 56:44.735
I'll swim to the airlock
where we came in

56:44.735 --> 56:46.153
and do the override.

56:46.153 --> 56:49.281
You have no suit.
How could it work?

56:49.281 --> 56:51.325
Water doesn't compress
under pressure,

56:51.325 --> 56:53.410
so if he can force water
in his sinus cavities,

56:53.410 --> 56:55.954
he could survive 30,
maybe 60 seconds

56:55.954 --> 56:57.372
before he passes out.

56:57.372 --> 56:58.540
- It is possible.

57:01.043 --> 57:02.919
We work the problems
one by one.

57:04.671 --> 57:07.549
We do what's in front of us,
then we do the next thing.

57:15.724 --> 57:17.309
If anyone
can do this,

57:17.976 --> 57:18.935
it's you.

57:36.745 --> 57:39.206
Won't he be crushed
by the pressure?

57:39.206 --> 57:41.083
It doesn't work
like that.

57:41.083 --> 57:44.753
You don't see fish
wearing metal suits, do you?

57:44.753 --> 57:47.839
It's about air.
It reacts under pressure.

57:47.839 --> 57:50.550
And that's why he has to
blow it out of his sinuses.

58:50.277 --> 58:51.987
Hey there,
tree hugger.

58:56.241 --> 58:59.077
Jonas Taylor, eco-warrior,

58:59.077 --> 59:01.121
fighting the good fight.

59:01.121 --> 59:03.123
Well, guess what?

59:03.123 --> 59:04.166
You lost.

59:09.087 --> 59:12.799
I spent two years
in a Manila prison

59:12.799 --> 59:15.677
after you
and your eco-freak buddies

59:16.553 --> 59:18.555
had our ship seized.

59:18.555 --> 59:21.141
I thought about you
every single day.

59:22.768 --> 59:25.395
You don't even remember me,
do you?

59:25.395 --> 59:26.938
- Hmm?

59:26.938 --> 59:28.440
No?

59:28.440 --> 59:30.650
Montes.

59:30.650 --> 59:33.612
There's a million scumbags
in this world.

59:36.615 --> 59:38.617
It's hard to keep track
of all of 'em.

59:55.300 --> 59:56.635
I don't think I can make it!

59:56.635 --> 59:58.178
You can do it. It's okay.

01:00:47.352 --> 01:00:48.478
We're going to die!

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:49.521
It's ok, it's ok.

01:01:47.579 --> 01:01:48.538
Meiying!

01:01:49.414 --> 01:01:50.373
Meiying!

01:02:09.601 --> 01:02:11.603
Clean up crew
approaching Mana One.

01:02:11.603 --> 01:02:13.772
About time.
We are on alert.

01:02:13.772 --> 01:02:16.274
Everyone confined
to their quarters.

01:02:16.274 --> 01:02:18.735
We need to get control
of Mana One

01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:20.695
and dispose
of any liabilities.

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:26.952
What's the emergency?

01:02:26.952 --> 01:02:28.912
I got into
the security backup.

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:29.996
Look at this.

01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:33.708
Jess disabled the rescue sub.

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:37.253
- What?
- Watch.

01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:38.922
Like she could be
repairing it, right?

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:40.173
But no, wait.

01:02:44.552 --> 01:02:45.971
It's Montes' sub.

01:02:45.971 --> 01:02:47.514
That's our ride out of here.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:56.982
There's a leak
in the hydraulics.

01:02:56.982 --> 01:02:58.775
Predator countermeasures
are down.

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:00.777
We'll never make it
past the megs.

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:02.445
We need
a distraction.

01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:06.116
Light up the station.
The megs will attack it.

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:07.659
Yeah. And kill us.

01:03:08.576 --> 01:03:10.161
Not if we're fast enough.

01:03:10.161 --> 01:03:11.079
Jiuming!

01:03:19.254 --> 01:03:21.006
-  Hey, Rigas.
- Yep?

01:03:21.006 --> 01:03:22.841
For a moment, I thought you
were gonna kill me back there.

01:03:22.841 --> 01:03:25.427
Well, she did say
to shoot you in the heart.

01:03:25.427 --> 01:03:27.721
And I know for a fact
you ain't got one of those.

01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:34.227
Thank you for working.

01:03:48.199 --> 01:03:49.701
Gotta close
the hatch, Jonas.

01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:55.081
We're all gonna die.

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:57.834
He's gonna make it.

01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:58.835
No, he's not.

01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:03.339
- He's gonna make it.
- No!

01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:05.341
We have to close the hatch!

01:04:10.138 --> 01:04:11.681
-  Close it! Jonas!

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:21.649
I'm here!

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:24.903
-  That's him!

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:37.499
That was close.

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:40.251
Too close.

01:04:42.796 --> 01:04:45.173
You should have shut
the hatch.

01:04:45.173 --> 01:04:47.050
Yeah.
Meiying would have killed me.

01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:52.889
You thought about it, though.

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:54.265
Yeah. We thought about it.

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:56.142
Didn't we, Rigas?

01:04:56.142 --> 01:04:57.936
Shut up.

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:01.022
Just a little bit.

01:05:01.022 --> 01:05:02.816
Very funny.

01:05:11.032 --> 01:05:12.200
Explosives?

01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:14.786
Check this out.

01:05:14.786 --> 01:05:16.454
Look what else.

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.177
Is that gonna be
a problem?

01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:33.388
It's a hole
in the thermal layer.

01:05:33.388 --> 01:05:36.516
It must have been caused
by the mining explosions.

01:05:36.516 --> 01:05:38.017
It will seal up eventually.

01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:40.395
Eventually?

01:05:40.395 --> 01:05:42.897
Yeah. Within an hour.

01:05:42.897 --> 01:05:44.858
Can the megs
follow us through?

01:05:46.025 --> 01:05:47.152
I hope not.

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:13.511
Boys,
I don't want to harm you,

01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:15.597
but I do need you
to come out of this room.

01:06:15.597 --> 01:06:17.849
It's Jess.
She's got three soldiers.

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:20.560
Yeah. It's go time.

01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:22.770
Take this.

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:24.063
- The hell is this?
- It's a Taser.

01:06:24.939 --> 01:06:26.566
Open up.

01:06:26.566 --> 01:06:27.859
They tried to kill Jonas,

01:06:27.859 --> 01:06:29.027
they're definitely
gonna kill us.

01:06:29.027 --> 01:06:30.528
Okay, listen.
Here's the plan.

01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:32.447
On the count of three,
you'll open the door

01:06:32.447 --> 01:06:34.199
and I'mma pepper spray 'em.

01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:35.491
Right, and you'll shut the door
and you're gonna wait.

01:06:35.491 --> 01:06:37.202
Then go out there
and use the Taser.

01:06:37.202 --> 01:06:38.828
One, two, three.

01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:44.792
-  No, Mac, no! No, Mac...

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:47.670
It burns! It burns!

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:49.130
-  I'm sorry!

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:50.757
Sleepy time.

01:07:05.438 --> 01:07:06.397
- What's that?

01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:10.485
Trouble.

01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:20.787
So, we're walking fast
and with

01:07:20.787 --> 01:07:22.872
a lot of determination,
which is great.

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:25.083
But what exactly
is the plan here?

01:07:25.083 --> 01:07:26.459
They're armed and we're not.

01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:33.299
All righty.
So what are you thinking?

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.719
What are you thinking?

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:38.346
You and I find Mac and DJ.

01:07:38.346 --> 01:07:39.931
Rigas, grab what you can.

01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:41.224
Secure a Zodiac
so we can get off this thing.

01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:42.684
Rock and roll.

01:07:42.684 --> 01:07:44.352
Safest if Meiying
goes with you.

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:54.737
I'll protect her with my life.

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:55.905
And I'll protect her
with mine.

01:07:56.698 --> 01:07:58.908
No.

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:00.034
No.

01:08:01.369 --> 01:08:02.328
Let's go.

01:08:14.674 --> 01:08:16.759
I told you to wait
before you went out that door.

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:18.761
- How's your eyes?
- My eye stings.

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:21.723
If we climb up
to the communications array,

01:08:21.723 --> 01:08:23.975
we can bypass the DCC
and we can call for help.

01:08:23.975 --> 01:08:25.184
What are we supposed to say?

01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:27.520
Uh... terrorist action?

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.981
- Yeah, good. Terrorist action.
- Yeah, terrorist action.

01:08:29.981 --> 01:08:31.357
-  Okay.
- You got a better idea?

01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:32.984
-  Freeze!

01:08:32.984 --> 01:08:34.027
Oh, no.

01:08:43.828 --> 01:08:45.413
DJ! DJ!

01:08:47.415 --> 01:08:48.499
What the hell?

01:08:48.499 --> 01:08:51.711
Wow! Yeah, baby!
Get some!

01:08:51.711 --> 01:08:52.962
- Hey.
- Run, Mac! Run!

01:08:54.339 --> 01:08:55.381
-  Go, go, go!

01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:09.645
Spread out!
Find 'em.

01:09:13.066 --> 01:09:15.985
You got Tasers?
Now you can swim?

01:09:15.985 --> 01:09:18.905
All of a sudden you run around
like you're frickin' Batman.

01:09:18.905 --> 01:09:21.199
- Hell yeah.

01:09:21.199 --> 01:09:24.577
After last time,
y'all begged me to come back.

01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:27.622
-"DJ, oh, we family, DJ."

01:09:27.622 --> 01:09:30.541
"DJ, we need you."
Yeah, all right. Bet.

01:09:30.541 --> 01:09:31.959
But I ain't stupid.

01:09:31.959 --> 01:09:33.211
I trained up,
I learned how to fight,

01:09:33.211 --> 01:09:34.879
I learned how to swim,

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:36.881
and I will never go anywhere
without my survival pack.

01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:38.466
- Survival pack?
- Yeah.

01:09:38.466 --> 01:09:39.801
Check this out.

01:09:39.801 --> 01:09:41.969
Mmm-hmm. Come here, baby.
Come here.

01:09:41.969 --> 01:09:44.472
Bam.

01:09:44.472 --> 01:09:47.266
Yeah, I even made
poison-tipped bullets,

01:09:47.266 --> 01:09:49.435
just like Jaws 2.

01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:54.690
Come on, DJ!
Let's go, let's go.

01:09:58.361 --> 01:09:59.362
This is insane.

01:10:03.116 --> 01:10:04.450
Freeze, assholes.

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:08.663
Yeah, freeze.

01:10:08.663 --> 01:10:09.789
You got this?

01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:16.504
That was some
unfortunate shit back there.

01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:18.631
No, please!
Don't shoot!

01:10:21.259 --> 01:10:22.844
I know you're
looking for me and Jonas.

01:10:22.844 --> 01:10:24.345
I also know
you don't speak Chinese,

01:10:24.345 --> 01:10:27.223
but I'm speaking it
to distract you guys,

01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:29.642
because my friend is about
to attack you from behind.

01:10:29.642 --> 01:10:31.060
What?

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:38.484
-  sucker.

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:43.614
I thought you were dead.

01:10:43.614 --> 01:10:45.491
- Wishful thinking, Mac.

01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:47.994
If it ain't
the deviated septum.

01:10:47.994 --> 01:10:49.454
- Boat's leaving.

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:55.084
What's our status?

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.043
Bravo team
are inbound.

01:10:56.043 --> 01:10:57.128
ETA, ten minutes.

01:10:57.128 --> 01:10:58.212
Excellent.

01:11:00.006 --> 01:11:01.340
Uh, what are you doing here?

01:11:05.678 --> 01:11:06.637
Mmm.

01:11:08.848 --> 01:11:10.766
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:14.061
Jonas is on Mana One.

01:11:14.061 --> 01:11:16.939
We need to lock this place
down now.

01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:20.902
Search the station
top to bottom.

01:11:20.902 --> 01:11:22.445
Secure personnel
in their quarters,

01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:23.696
kill anyone else.

01:11:24.322 --> 01:11:26.240
Go! Go!

01:11:33.664 --> 01:11:34.624
Oh, my God.

01:11:39.712 --> 01:11:41.422
Uh, guys?

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:44.592
We've got a big problem.

01:11:52.892 --> 01:11:54.393
We tracked three megs

01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:55.853
that escaped
before the breach closed.

01:11:55.853 --> 01:11:57.897
We're gonna need
a good cover story for this.

01:11:57.897 --> 01:11:59.482
Well, that shouldn't be hard.

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:01.859
Everyone knows Jonas
and Jiuming were reckless.

01:12:01.859 --> 01:12:03.986
No, we need a hero.

01:12:03.986 --> 01:12:05.988
Like, someone to emerge

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:07.990
from this
unforeseeable tragedy,

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:10.117
who can step into
a leadership position

01:12:10.117 --> 01:12:11.452
at the Institute.

01:12:11.452 --> 01:12:15.164
Jess, are you ready
for promotion?

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:17.667
I appreciate your confidence.

01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:18.918
Jess!

01:12:18.918 --> 01:12:20.169
It's from
the thermocline breach.

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:21.504
But you can relax.

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:23.923
This place? Meg-proof.

01:12:23.923 --> 01:12:25.716
I mean, Jonas was
always afraid of this,

01:12:25.716 --> 01:12:27.426
but I think, between trackers
and gunships,

01:12:27.426 --> 01:12:29.470
we can solve the problem
and come out the other side

01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:31.472
with a significant positive
PR spin.

01:12:32.306 --> 01:12:33.307
Yeah, I'm on it.

01:12:33.307 --> 01:12:34.350
I was also thinking...

01:13:00.459 --> 01:13:01.877
What now?

01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:03.879
It's our only way off.
We have to take it.

01:13:03.879 --> 01:13:05.131
But that thing
doesn't have the range

01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:07.466
to get us to the mainland.

01:13:07.466 --> 01:13:09.260
You're worried about
the destination?

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:10.970
What about
the first hundred yards?

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:12.680
That's where we goin' die.

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.098
We paddle out slow.

01:13:14.098 --> 01:13:16.559
No engines.
Minimal motion.

01:13:16.559 --> 01:13:18.019
We won't look like food.

01:13:18.019 --> 01:13:20.354
When we're clear,
we make a run for it. Huh?

01:13:20.354 --> 01:13:21.439
Let's do it.

01:13:23.316 --> 01:13:25.276
I still think
we look like food.

01:13:25.276 --> 01:13:27.778
Shh.
Quiet, everyone.

01:13:27.778 --> 01:13:29.280
Paddle slowly.

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.824
This feels
unpleasantly familiar.

01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:34.035
I just hope it goes better
than last time.

01:13:34.952 --> 01:13:35.953
What happened last time?

01:13:36.871 --> 01:13:38.122
You don't wanna know.

01:13:43.044 --> 01:13:45.421
Oh.
Here he comes.

01:13:52.178 --> 01:13:53.304
Go, go, go!

01:13:55.389 --> 01:13:57.350
Let's not
bring 'em back alive.

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:00.436
You do know how to
drive this thing, right?

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:09.820
Stop! Stop the engine
right now.

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:12.948
Or you will attract the megs.

01:14:14.408 --> 01:14:17.703
Okay. Be still.

01:14:17.703 --> 01:14:19.497
- No motion whatsoever.

01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:26.003
I have the shot.

01:14:27.421 --> 01:14:28.839
Take it.

01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:30.508
- Get down!
-  Mate, do your job.

01:14:30.508 --> 01:14:31.467
- Take the bloody shot.
- It's not easy as it looks.

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:38.015
He got 'em!
He ate 'em!

01:14:38.015 --> 01:14:39.308
He ate the whole boat!

01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:44.313
What happened?

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:46.440
Jess is dead.

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:48.067
- What?
- We stabilized Mana One

01:14:48.067 --> 01:14:50.319
but Taylor and Zhang
have escaped.

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:51.529
What do you want me to do?

01:14:51.529 --> 01:14:53.114
Fix it! Kill them!

01:14:53.114 --> 01:14:55.449
You do this,
you write your own ticket.

01:14:55.449 --> 01:14:56.826
You are set for life.

01:14:57.910 --> 01:15:00.037
Okay.

01:15:00.037 --> 01:15:02.373
There's only a couple places
they could make it to.

01:15:02.373 --> 01:15:04.667
- Are you crying, Montes?

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:18.347
Any sign of the megs?

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:20.850
Negative.

01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:22.893
There's no way
this thing's gonna work.

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:25.479
It's gonna work.

01:15:25.479 --> 01:15:27.440
Bloke, you got more chance
of blowing up yourself

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:29.400
than one of the megs.

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.110
At least I won't get eaten.

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:33.028
Ha, I hear that.

01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:34.989
Jo, can you make me one?

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:38.659
I got you covered, Mac.

01:15:38.659 --> 01:15:40.745
We have to find a way
to warn people.

01:15:40.745 --> 01:15:43.164
In case the megs
move towards land.

01:15:43.164 --> 01:15:46.959
There's an island 60 klicks
southeast of us.

01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:49.003
It's listed as inhabited.

01:15:49.003 --> 01:15:50.880
Inhabited by who?

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.090
The name more or less
translates to...

01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:55.092
Fun Island.

01:15:56.302 --> 01:15:57.303
Fun Island?

01:16:03.017 --> 01:16:04.185
Yeah!

01:16:09.482 --> 01:16:13.778
Welcome to Fun Island.
Our resort has everything.

01:16:13.778 --> 01:16:16.489
The restaurant, amazing.

01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:18.949
The disco, incredible.

01:16:18.949 --> 01:16:20.743
- And our spa, to die for.
-  Oh.

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:22.787
-  Oh.
-  OMG.

01:16:22.787 --> 01:16:25.247
It's our special dish.
Seafood Surprise!

01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:27.833
Wow! I wouldn't know
where to start.

01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:29.877
Well, just don't miss out
on the grilled shark.

01:16:29.877 --> 01:16:31.587
- Pippin! Pippin!

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:32.963
Pippin!

01:16:32.963 --> 01:16:34.882
- Whoa, what is that?
-  Pippin!

01:16:34.882 --> 01:16:36.425
What are
they running from?

01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:41.347
Your first time
at the rodeo?

01:16:43.015 --> 01:16:45.518
I worked with your dad since
before you were born.

01:16:45.518 --> 01:16:47.019
I never had this kind
of trouble from him.

01:16:47.019 --> 01:16:49.021
Can you put your phone down?

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:51.524
After all these hard years
we're finally on vacation,

01:16:51.524 --> 01:16:54.068
savor the moment.

01:16:54.068 --> 01:16:55.986
Yeah, and I yelled at him too.

01:16:55.986 --> 01:16:59.281
I've already got 400 likes.

01:17:00.658 --> 01:17:01.909
I'm sitting in paradise

01:17:01.909 --> 01:17:03.786
and you are ruining it!

01:17:03.786 --> 01:17:04.995
Who does that? Who...

01:17:04.995 --> 01:17:06.956
ruins paradise
for other people?

01:17:09.834 --> 01:17:11.544
Hey, baby.

01:17:11.544 --> 01:17:13.170
Wanna rub some oil on my back?

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:15.923
No?

01:17:15.923 --> 01:17:17.007
How 'bout my front?

01:17:17.675 --> 01:17:18.592
Ew.

01:17:24.431 --> 01:17:25.432
Come over.

01:17:26.517 --> 01:17:27.685
What?

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.565
What are you doing?

01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:39.572
Yaoyao...

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:43.617
Will you marry me?

01:17:48.789 --> 01:17:50.416
Find it, idiot!

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:51.959
Wait!

01:17:54.044 --> 01:17:55.963
Have you found it?

01:17:59.758 --> 01:18:00.801
Hey.

01:18:04.263 --> 01:18:05.431
Yaoyao.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.559
Yaoyao.

01:18:08.559 --> 01:18:10.477
- Yaoyao! Yaoyao!

01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:44.887
This doesn't look good.

01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:47.473
Rigas, get us there fast!

01:18:54.897 --> 01:18:56.565
Kill the cell phone uplink.

01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:09.745
There's a lot
of exposure for us on this.

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:11.956
Take care of Jonas
and his team quickly,

01:19:11.956 --> 01:19:13.540
and quietly.

01:19:16.126 --> 01:19:17.753
Everybody
out of the water!

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:19.922
-  Shark! Shark!
-  Get back on the beach!

01:19:19.922 --> 01:19:22.591
- Get out of the water!

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:23.842
Get back on the beach, every...

01:19:27.304 --> 01:19:28.806
Mobile comms
are down. Over.

01:20:14.101 --> 01:20:15.185
You copy, guys?

01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:19.231
-  Crocodile!

01:20:19.231 --> 01:20:20.733
What is that?

01:20:20.733 --> 01:20:22.234
-  Move, move!
- Get into the chopper.

01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:23.944
- Now! Go with her!

01:20:28.449 --> 01:20:30.451
Mmm. Mmm.

01:20:39.877 --> 01:20:40.878
Everybody out!

01:20:40.878 --> 01:20:41.962
Shark!

01:20:41.962 --> 01:20:43.047
Shark!

01:20:43.047 --> 01:20:44.089
Go back!

01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:45.049
Don't go into the water!

01:20:45.049 --> 01:20:46.759
There's a shark!

01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:48.052
Get on the beach!

01:20:48.052 --> 01:20:49.303
Go back!

01:20:49.303 --> 01:20:50.763
We have to save them.

01:20:50.763 --> 01:20:52.973
- I'm not leaving ya.
- Cell phone's down.

01:20:52.973 --> 01:20:54.475
Hello? Hello?

01:20:54.475 --> 01:20:56.018
-  No signal.
- There's no choice.

01:20:56.018 --> 01:20:57.519
- She's right.
-  We got no signal, guys.

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:59.605
Hey, you two!
Find a way to call for help.

01:20:59.605 --> 01:21:01.315
Let everyone know
what happened.

01:21:01.315 --> 01:21:02.524
Come on! Come on!
This way! This way!

01:21:03.734 --> 01:21:04.818
You're gonna hide.

01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:06.445
See that lifeguard tower?

01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:07.863
- Yeah.
- You go there
and you stay there.

01:21:07.863 --> 01:21:09.031
This is not
one of those things

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:10.449
where I tell you
to do something,

01:21:10.449 --> 01:21:11.784
you say "yes,"

01:21:11.784 --> 01:21:13.077
and then you do
whatever you want.

01:21:13.077 --> 01:21:14.495
Understand?

01:21:14.495 --> 01:21:16.038
Yes.

01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:17.289
You're not messing with me?

01:21:17.289 --> 01:21:18.957
No.

01:21:18.957 --> 01:21:20.959
I can't do what I need to do
if I'm worried about you.

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.545
I'll be fine.

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:24.963
Promise me
you'll come back.

01:21:28.509 --> 01:21:29.927
You know I love you.

01:22:09.508 --> 01:22:10.592
Oh, shit.

01:22:15.472 --> 01:22:16.849
Sonny.

01:22:16.849 --> 01:22:18.892
- Check that out.

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:24.314
Hey, yo, my man.
You got a phone?

01:22:25.691 --> 01:22:27.067
What's everyone running from?

01:22:28.485 --> 01:22:30.737
What the hell was that?

01:22:30.737 --> 01:22:31.864
Three megs.

01:22:31.864 --> 01:22:33.031
Three of us.

01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:34.575
We each grab a jet ski.

01:22:34.575 --> 01:22:35.826
Get them to chase it away

01:22:35.826 --> 01:22:37.828
from these people
and out to sea.

01:22:37.828 --> 01:22:39.121
Then we harpoon them.

01:22:39.121 --> 01:22:40.706
Oh, you mean
with those jerry-rigged,

01:22:40.706 --> 01:22:43.125
maybe-they-work,
maybe-they-kill-us harpoons?

01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:44.209
Yeah.

01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:45.961
It's a terrible idea.

01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:47.129
You got a better one?

01:22:47.129 --> 01:22:48.338
No. No.

01:22:48.338 --> 01:22:49.965
- Then we're agreed.
- Yeah.

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:51.133
- Good.
- Great.

01:23:06.315 --> 01:23:07.524
Montes!

01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:10.569
Shit.

01:23:38.639 --> 01:23:40.015
Let's go old school.

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.357
The landline's down, too.

01:23:48.357 --> 01:23:50.025
Okay, coast is clear.
Let's go.

01:23:56.949 --> 01:23:58.075
They can walk?

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:00.619
Shit.

01:24:02.162 --> 01:24:03.497
It's those things.

01:24:03.497 --> 01:24:05.290
They haven't spotted us yet.

01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:08.043
- Okay.

01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:14.049
What else you got in here?

01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:15.592
Emergency stuff.

01:24:18.178 --> 01:24:19.137
Okay.

01:24:22.557 --> 01:24:24.977
Really? Condoms?

01:24:24.977 --> 01:24:26.853
Different kind of emergencies.

01:24:26.853 --> 01:24:27.896
Hand me that.

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:33.110
Now hand me
that gum in your mouth.

01:24:35.529 --> 01:24:36.571
Thank you.

01:24:49.668 --> 01:24:51.253
There's only one ski.

01:24:51.253 --> 01:24:52.379
Give me your harpoons.

01:24:53.797 --> 01:24:55.215
You sure?

01:24:55.215 --> 01:24:56.133
Oh...

01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:02.055
- I got this.
-  Good luck.

01:25:03.307 --> 01:25:05.183
We need more firepower.

01:25:05.183 --> 01:25:06.226
Yeah.

01:25:07.978 --> 01:25:10.230
I have an idea.
Let's go.

01:25:19.156 --> 01:25:20.782
Not this time, Taylor.

01:25:22.743 --> 01:25:23.702
Vamos.

01:25:42.429 --> 01:25:43.889
This should be
the place.

01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:47.934
Come on.

01:25:54.316 --> 01:25:55.400
What are we looking for?

01:25:57.194 --> 01:25:58.528
Ammonium nitrate.

01:26:00.113 --> 01:26:01.448
You're making a bomb?

01:26:01.448 --> 01:26:03.909
This stuff is
as powerful as TNT.

01:26:03.909 --> 01:26:05.077
-  Hey!

01:26:05.077 --> 01:26:07.162
- Get in! Get in!

01:26:12.376 --> 01:26:13.460
Freeze!

01:26:31.395 --> 01:26:32.312
Come on!

01:27:04.177 --> 01:27:05.095
Come on!

01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:19.693
Come on, let's see
if he's got a phone.

01:27:23.155 --> 01:27:25.115
I got the sat phone.
I got the sat...

01:27:25.115 --> 01:27:26.825
I got the phone.
Why you stealing his money?

01:27:26.825 --> 01:27:28.326
- What? He's not gonna need it.

01:27:28.326 --> 01:27:30.245
Uh-oh.

01:27:30.245 --> 01:27:33.748
- Nice doggies. Nice doggies.

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:35.125
Okay, Rigas.

01:27:35.125 --> 01:27:37.335
On the count of three,
we're gonna bolt.

01:27:37.335 --> 01:27:39.421
One. Two. Three!

01:27:39.421 --> 01:27:40.797
What the hell? Hey!

01:27:42.007 --> 01:27:44.843
Wait for DJ!
Wait for DJ!

01:27:46.928 --> 01:27:48.930
They're right
behind us!

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:50.307
Let's hide in here!

01:27:50.307 --> 01:27:52.350
Come on. Come on.
Come here. Come here.

01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:54.394
- What the hell?
- Hi, DJ. Hi, Rigas.

01:27:54.394 --> 01:27:55.562
-  Whoa.
- All of you together.

01:27:55.562 --> 01:27:57.898
Up against the wall.
Hands up!

01:27:57.898 --> 01:27:59.024
I wouldn't point that at me

01:27:59.024 --> 01:28:01.151
if I were you.
Trust me.

01:28:01.151 --> 01:28:03.153
Shut it!
Keep your hands in the air.

01:28:03.153 --> 01:28:04.279
Hands up!

01:28:08.158 --> 01:28:09.951
Don't want to hurt you,

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:12.496
so I'm going
to give you one chance.

01:28:12.496 --> 01:28:14.289
Put those weapons down.

01:28:14.289 --> 01:28:15.415
Or you'll do what?

01:28:16.708 --> 01:28:18.460
Stay still, little guy.

01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:26.259
No, no! Joe, Joe, door!

01:28:26.259 --> 01:28:28.929
- Stay where you are!

01:28:28.929 --> 01:28:30.639
- Go, go!
-  Get to cover!

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:49.741
Damn!

01:28:53.245 --> 01:28:54.246
I got signal.

01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:55.539
Call for help!

01:28:55.539 --> 01:28:57.832
To get down to the beach
and help people!

01:28:57.832 --> 01:28:59.292
Where are you going?

01:28:59.292 --> 01:29:01.211
- Stealing a chopper.
-  What chopper?

01:29:01.211 --> 01:29:02.462
Global rescue?

01:29:02.462 --> 01:29:03.880
We need rescue!

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:05.507
We need you to send
everybody you got!

01:29:05.507 --> 01:29:07.175
The National Guard,
the lifeguard,

01:29:07.175 --> 01:29:08.718
the Coast Guard. Anybody!

01:29:08.718 --> 01:29:09.928
Just come now!

01:30:16.661 --> 01:30:18.121
Ugh, looks like
someone else

01:30:18.121 --> 01:30:19.289
- had the same idea.

01:30:20.332 --> 01:30:21.833
We need a plan.

01:30:21.833 --> 01:30:24.169
We have to lead it away
and steal the chopper.

01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:27.339
Okay, you lead it away,
I'll steal the chopper.

01:30:27.339 --> 01:30:28.757
You distract it,
I'll get the chopper.

01:30:28.757 --> 01:30:29.924
Why me?

01:30:29.924 --> 01:30:31.176
Can you fly a chopper?

01:30:31.176 --> 01:30:32.469
Yeah, I can.

01:30:32.469 --> 01:30:33.637
- You have a license?
- Yes, I do!

01:30:33.637 --> 01:30:34.929
- I didn't know that.
- What?

01:30:34.929 --> 01:30:36.306
Okay, good plan.

01:30:36.306 --> 01:30:37.349
Mac!

01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:17.597
Jiuming! We gotta go!

01:31:24.396 --> 01:31:26.189
Fuel! Get the fuel!

01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:27.232
Gas! We need gas!

01:31:34.489 --> 01:31:35.615
Get up!

01:31:41.121 --> 01:31:42.205
Get the fuel!

01:31:48.753 --> 01:31:50.380
- Lizard incoming! Hold on!

01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:52.841
- Jiuming? Jiuming!

01:32:03.893 --> 01:32:04.811
Run!

01:32:11.735 --> 01:32:12.652
Go!

01:32:16.906 --> 01:32:17.907
Whoa, yay!

01:32:19.659 --> 01:32:20.660
Man,
I didn't think you were

01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:22.036
gonna make that one.

01:32:31.254 --> 01:32:32.172
Run!

01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:47.896
No.

01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:15.757
Where are you going,
Jonas?

01:33:57.131 --> 01:33:58.883
Get lower! That's Meiying!

01:33:58.883 --> 01:34:00.343
Are you sure
it's Meiying?

01:34:06.266 --> 01:34:07.350
Get lower!

01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:09.269
Okay, okay!
Hold on!

01:34:24.868 --> 01:34:25.952
Meiying!

01:34:27.745 --> 01:34:28.705
Over here!

01:34:31.833 --> 01:34:32.750
Leap up!

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.210
Jonas is still alive?

01:35:57.210 --> 01:35:58.962
Get me over there!

01:36:05.051 --> 01:36:06.844
Help!

01:36:06.844 --> 01:36:08.179
Hang on, Meiying!

01:36:24.028 --> 01:36:25.780
Taylor!

01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:30.910
Come on!

01:36:33.955 --> 01:36:36.249
Come out from under
the bridge, little troll!

01:37:00.273 --> 01:37:02.150
End of the line, no?

01:37:02.150 --> 01:37:03.234
I guess it is.

01:37:04.318 --> 01:37:05.695
You got the gun.

01:37:10.575 --> 01:37:11.576
I won't be needing this.

01:37:15.204 --> 01:37:17.248
I knew you couldn't do it.

01:37:20.334 --> 01:37:21.794
See you later, chum.

01:37:26.799 --> 01:37:27.800
Jiu!

01:37:29.969 --> 01:37:31.596
Meiying!

01:37:31.596 --> 01:37:33.389
Throw me the bomb!

01:37:33.389 --> 01:37:34.390
Where?

01:37:36.225 --> 01:37:37.226
Catch it!

01:39:08.568 --> 01:39:10.945
Hold on! I'm coming!

01:39:14.657 --> 01:39:15.783
Meiying!

01:39:17.034 --> 01:39:18.703
Meiying!

01:39:18.703 --> 01:39:19.871
-  Jonas! Over here!

01:39:21.038 --> 01:39:22.623
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:24.041
Uncle Jiuming
and Mac's in trouble.

01:39:29.297 --> 01:39:30.756
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

01:39:39.891 --> 01:39:41.350
Mac! Are you okay?

01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:42.393
- Mac?

01:40:39.533 --> 01:40:41.327
Come on,
you ugly bastard!

01:41:38.634 --> 01:41:40.344
Come on, come on, come on!

01:41:40.344 --> 01:41:41.762
Come on, come on. I got you,
I got you. Come on, come on!

01:41:41.762 --> 01:41:43.639
Come on!
Watch, watch, watch it!

01:41:43.639 --> 01:41:45.349
Come on, come on, come on!

01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:50.021
Meiying,
what are you doing here?

01:41:50.021 --> 01:41:51.230
I had to save the dog!

01:41:51.856 --> 01:41:53.232
What?

01:41:53.232 --> 01:41:54.567
-  Mommy's here.

01:41:54.567 --> 01:41:56.319
- Thank you! Thank you!
- You're welcome.

01:42:01.699 --> 01:42:02.742
Oh, no, you don't!

01:42:02.742 --> 01:42:03.993
Meiying! Come!

01:42:12.835 --> 01:42:13.794
Hell yeah!

01:42:13.794 --> 01:42:15.755
Get some!

01:42:15.755 --> 01:42:18.674
Who says a .50 caliber
is an impractical round?

01:42:23.888 --> 01:42:25.598
Hey! Wait, wait, wait!

01:42:25.598 --> 01:42:27.725
Everyone stay still.
No motion.

01:42:29.393 --> 01:42:31.187
No, it's okay.

01:42:31.187 --> 01:42:32.688
That's Haiqi.

01:42:32.688 --> 01:42:34.106
Who cares which one it is?

01:42:35.107 --> 01:42:36.567
She'll listen to me.

01:42:36.567 --> 01:42:38.527
Let's spread out so that thing
don't get us all.

01:42:38.527 --> 01:42:39.570
I got this!

01:43:11.852 --> 01:43:14.814
Yes! I knew it!

01:43:14.814 --> 01:43:17.400
I told you!
We have a special bond.

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:20.319
- It went after the dolphins.
-  No!

01:43:20.319 --> 01:43:21.946
She obeyed my command.

01:43:21.946 --> 01:43:24.698
Ridiculous.

01:43:24.698 --> 01:43:27.118
I didn't believe it before
and I don't believe it now.

01:43:27.118 --> 01:43:28.828
Hey, Mac,
back me up.

01:43:28.828 --> 01:43:30.538
I'm getting out of here
before she changes her mind.

01:43:31.997 --> 01:43:33.207
Mac!

01:43:33.207 --> 01:43:35.042
You guys stay there
and argue.

01:43:35.042 --> 01:43:36.710
She obeyed my command!

01:43:38.170 --> 01:43:39.755
- Dolphins.
- No!

01:43:46.178 --> 01:43:48.055
It's not my fault.

01:43:48.055 --> 01:43:49.265
Sometimes, there's a situation,

01:43:49.265 --> 01:43:50.433
and bad things
are happening,

01:43:50.433 --> 01:43:52.017
and you just have
to get involved.

01:43:53.727 --> 01:43:55.354
I'm glad
you finally understand.

01:43:57.731 --> 01:43:58.774
I'm proud of you.

01:44:02.111 --> 01:44:03.654
Next time
don't run around, ok?

01:44:07.533 --> 01:44:10.619
Rescue One
to Fun Island. Over.

01:44:10.619 --> 01:44:12.663
Oh, it's good
to hear your voice, man.

01:44:12.663 --> 01:44:14.832
We got a lot of people
who need help.

01:44:19.253 --> 01:44:20.463
Yeah,
I used to didn't know

01:44:20.463 --> 01:44:21.547
how to swim,
but then, you know,

01:44:21.547 --> 01:44:22.798
you out there chasing sharks,

01:44:22.798 --> 01:44:24.133
you better learn
how to swim quick!

01:44:25.801 --> 01:44:27.470
The water was cold. It wasn't
that cold, but yeah,

01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:29.305
- I was just having fun!
-  What about Haiqi?

01:44:30.264 --> 01:44:31.640
She's still out there.

01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:33.100
- Maybe pregnant.
- ...lucky to be alive, baby.

01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:33.976
- Oh, preferably not.
-  Know what's crazy?

01:44:33.976 --> 01:44:35.102
Like, a few years ago...

01:44:35.102 --> 01:44:36.395
That's tomorrow.

01:44:36.395 --> 01:44:39.398
Today, we count our blessings.

01:44:39.398 --> 01:44:40.691
Here's to being alive.

01:44:42.276 --> 01:44:44.278
Here's to dolphins.

01:44:44.278 --> 01:44:47.656
- To Meiying being safe.

01:44:47.656 --> 01:44:49.533
And here's to Sal,
Lance, and Curtis.

01:44:52.912 --> 01:44:54.246
So...

01:44:54.246 --> 01:44:55.456
am I still grounded?

01:44:58.959 --> 01:45:00.336
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

01:45:06.091 --> 01:45:07.593
You two are ridiculous.

01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:10.596
But I love you anyway.

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:12.473
Mmm.

01:45:14.850 --> 01:45:17.895
Looks like you got
a little reckless out there.

01:45:17.895 --> 01:45:20.898
No, everything
was totally under control.

01:45:20.898 --> 01:45:22.691
-  Yeah, right.

01:45:22.691 --> 01:45:25.277
Well, everything's about to be
totally not under control.

01:45:27.238 --> 01:45:28.280
Give me some.

01:45:32.785 --> 01:45:34.036
Mmm.

01:45:34.036 --> 01:45:36.038
