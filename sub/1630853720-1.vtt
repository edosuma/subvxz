WEBVTT

00:24.232 --> 00:25.734
Skadoosh!

00:34.951 --> 00:37.328
Once again, hear tell of Po,

00:38.413 --> 00:39.748
the Dragon Master!

00:44.544 --> 00:48.047
Revered in all of China
for his bodacious skills.

00:48.131 --> 00:51.718
So self-confident
he uses words like "bodacious"

00:51.801 --> 00:53.887
long after they've gone out of fashion.

00:55.430 --> 00:59.184
He has defeated the most dangerous
and cunning enemies of China.

01:01.936 --> 01:05.732
He has risen to great levels
of achievement and fame.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.069
He even has his own Happy Lunch toy,

01:09.152 --> 01:11.905
and is loved by the Emperor himself.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.531
And on top of all that,

01:13.615 --> 01:16.659
he has won Employee of the Month
at his dad's noodle shop

01:16.743 --> 01:17.952
seven years in a row.

01:18.036 --> 01:21.623
-Oh, no. Except that one time--
-But it wasn't his fault.

01:21.706 --> 01:24.125
And now, with the land at peace,

01:24.209 --> 01:27.670
and inactivity making him
slightly flabby and easily winded,

01:27.754 --> 01:30.507
he has accepted
the challenge of a lifelong dream.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.802
A food tour of China!

01:33.885 --> 01:36.888
Oh, you deserve it, Po.

01:36.971 --> 01:42.310
Now, go out there, enjoy your fans,
and realize that the best food in China…

01:43.228 --> 01:44.395
is made by me.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.192
Where are you going first?

01:49.275 --> 01:51.986
Pei-Pei's House of Fat Gobs
in Wankun village,

01:52.070 --> 01:53.905
home of the WuGao Gauntlet.

01:53.988 --> 01:55.698
That thing's insanely powerful.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.535
I can't wait to check it out.

02:10.755 --> 02:12.507
-Ah!
-Yay!

02:12.590 --> 02:14.217
-Dragon Master!
-Hey.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.135
Hey!

02:16.636 --> 02:17.470
Mm!

02:19.722 --> 02:21.641
Hey, it's the Dragon Master.

02:21.724 --> 02:22.809
Look, it's Po.

02:22.892 --> 02:24.394
Oh, hey!

02:26.521 --> 02:27.522
Wow.

02:28.106 --> 02:28.940
Hey.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.652
-Will you sign my parchment?

02:32.735 --> 02:35.029
Bye. See you later.

02:40.577 --> 02:43.538
Ah, I can smell those fat gobs already.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.167
The wait's almost over, buddy.

03:04.058 --> 03:05.476
Oh, man.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.895
The WuGao Gauntlet!

03:07.645 --> 03:08.897
So cool.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.861
Oh! But first,

03:14.944 --> 03:17.280
Pei-Pei's House of Fat Gobs.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.407
-There he is.
-The Dragon Master.

03:22.577 --> 03:25.288
Oh! Dragon Master!

03:26.873 --> 03:28.333
Uh, hey guys, yes.

03:28.416 --> 03:31.044
It's me. Love you, too. Gotta keep moving.

03:31.127 --> 03:32.587
Mr. Dragon Master,

03:32.670 --> 03:34.422
can I have an autograph?

03:36.591 --> 03:37.884
Kiss the baby!

03:37.967 --> 03:39.385
K-Kiss the baby.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.179
No kissing. Nice to see you.

03:41.262 --> 03:43.765
-I named my child after you.
-I wish I could stay.

03:43.848 --> 03:45.892
-Let me get closer.
-I gotta keep it moving.

03:45.975 --> 03:48.478
-Can you sign my nunchucks?

03:48.561 --> 03:51.189
-Hey, hey, hey, okay. Watch the fur!

03:51.272 --> 03:53.316
-Me, me, me!
-Y'all have no boundaries.

03:55.526 --> 03:58.029
Little space here. Guys.

03:58.112 --> 04:00.657
Okay, no touchy.
I love you, bye. Whoa!

04:01.324 --> 04:02.784
-Oh no, let me in!

04:02.867 --> 04:05.745
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

04:05.828 --> 04:07.205
-Please.
-But the crowd!

04:07.288 --> 04:09.832
-I know.
-I fear for the safety of my restaurant.

04:09.916 --> 04:13.544
Please? So hungry.
Do you have a private dining room?

04:15.296 --> 04:16.381
Okay, okay.

04:21.052 --> 04:22.553
-Me too!
-Sign this for me!

04:33.523 --> 04:37.360
-You can eat in here.
-No, I don't think I wanna-- Whoa!

04:37.443 --> 04:39.028
Wait, in the closet? Really?

04:39.112 --> 04:41.406
Hm. I'll fetch you a fat gob.

04:41.489 --> 04:44.033
I'm all alone in here.

04:48.663 --> 04:51.708
Alright, I know, I know. I'm hungry too.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.674
Oh hello, Radish.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.231
Hm?

05:20.945 --> 05:21.779
Huh?

05:27.327 --> 05:29.120
-Stop them.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.873
-Stop them! Somebody stop them.
-Not the gauntlet!

05:34.625 --> 05:36.919
And even though
everyone's always asking,

05:37.003 --> 05:38.671
"Where's the Dragon Master?"

05:38.755 --> 05:41.382
no one asks, "How's the Dragon Master?"

05:43.676 --> 05:47.847
Huh. I never thought of it that way.
That's what I like about you, Radish.

05:47.930 --> 05:49.640
-You just get me.

05:49.724 --> 05:52.226
-They're heading for the gauntlet!
-The gauntlet?

05:52.310 --> 05:53.519
The gauntlet!

05:53.603 --> 05:55.188
Now, hold that thought.

05:55.271 --> 05:56.814
-Huh?

05:56.898 --> 05:59.108
What gives?

05:59.192 --> 06:02.653
Uh, hello? Hello, Pei-Pei?
Pei-Pei, you out there? Uh…

06:02.737 --> 06:06.949
The door seems to be stuck.
I gotta get out there and save the day.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.077
-Yes, yes, you're very hungry.
-Pei-Pei!

06:09.160 --> 06:11.662
-I get it. It'll be ready soon.
-I'll kick it open.

06:11.746 --> 06:14.332
-Stand firm.

06:14.415 --> 06:17.710
-No one can beat our defenses.

06:31.265 --> 06:33.893
Give up now.
You're not getting the gauntlet.

06:59.127 --> 07:02.213
-Not what we planned.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.298
Let me at 'em!

07:04.382 --> 07:07.468
I will take 'em all down, I will!

07:07.552 --> 07:11.889
I'll cook 'em up on a spit
till they spitter sputter spit!

07:11.973 --> 07:12.974
Veruca!

07:13.057 --> 07:14.142
Right.

07:18.563 --> 07:19.856
Ready.

07:20.356 --> 07:21.816
The Dragon Master is here!

07:22.400 --> 07:24.402
-Oh no. Whoa!

07:36.998 --> 07:37.832
Hold it.

07:40.751 --> 07:42.712
-Huh?

07:42.795 --> 07:45.798
-He's got the gauntlet.
-Oh no!

07:45.882 --> 07:47.175
Everyone, get back.

07:59.270 --> 08:02.690
Pity there's no time for that,
you little weasels.

08:02.773 --> 08:04.650
-We're weasels.

08:04.734 --> 08:05.568
Right.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.278
The Dragon Master is here!

08:07.945 --> 08:11.115
-Look! The Dragon Master.

08:11.199 --> 08:12.825
He'll save our village.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.248
-We love you!

08:25.087 --> 08:27.590
Whoa!

08:47.527 --> 08:50.696
-Good news. I saved the…

08:51.280 --> 08:52.281
…gauntlet.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.756
-Nice work, Pandy.
-Hey! Whoa. Give me that.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.476
-What? You gotta be kidding me.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.145
There's one more of 'em.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.189
I got this.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.579
Hold up. Stop. Stop!

09:39.662 --> 09:41.747
Seriously, stop, you guys.

09:41.831 --> 09:42.957
I'm, like…

09:43.040 --> 09:44.208
It's been a while.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.503
Oh, your buddies leaving without you, huh?

09:47.587 --> 09:50.506
-Mm, okay. A little challenging.

09:59.807 --> 10:00.766
-Huh?

10:03.144 --> 10:04.437
Oh, ow.

10:07.523 --> 10:08.524
No!

10:11.652 --> 10:13.487
Oh no you don't!

10:20.578 --> 10:22.038
Whoa!

10:32.840 --> 10:35.593
-Gotcha!
-What? How did he catch up?

10:35.676 --> 10:37.637
Aerodynamics, baby!

10:38.888 --> 10:41.057
-Yes!

10:42.308 --> 10:46.562
Surrender the gauntlet, panda,
before I set Veruca loose on you.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.440
I'll tear him into little pieces.
Little tweety birds.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.734
-Veruca!
-Right.

11:00.368 --> 11:01.577
The gauntlet!

11:03.454 --> 11:05.164
-Give me that gauntlet.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.419
Whoa!

11:10.503 --> 11:12.088
Do pandas swim?

11:13.130 --> 11:14.882
Of course, pandas can--

11:26.102 --> 11:26.936
Here's an idea,

11:27.019 --> 11:29.355
my little pandy-wandy friend.

11:29.438 --> 11:32.525
Let us give you a hand.

11:32.608 --> 11:33.859
Oh, that'd be swell.

11:36.237 --> 11:39.073
Just not with that hand.

11:40.825 --> 11:43.327
Farewell, fuzzy friend.

12:14.525 --> 12:17.611
Hey. Let the Dragon Master
give you a hand with that.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.447
No thanks, panda.

12:21.949 --> 12:24.034
Hey, I can, I can help you with that.

12:24.118 --> 12:26.579
We don't need any more of your help.

12:26.662 --> 12:28.831
I'm the Dragon Master.
I was just trying to--

12:28.914 --> 12:30.458
Destroy our village?

12:30.541 --> 12:32.126
You're a master at that.

12:32.209 --> 12:34.670
And the WuGao Gauntlet is gone.

12:34.753 --> 12:35.963
Because of you.

12:36.046 --> 12:38.632
That was our thing!

12:40.885 --> 12:42.178
Just leave it.

12:49.643 --> 12:53.063
-Maybe you want to--
-Have a little snack? Yeah, good idea.

12:53.147 --> 12:55.107
-Let everybody calm down.
-Leave.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.443
-Leave?
-Leave.

12:57.526 --> 12:59.236
-Leave.
-Leave.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.404
"Leave" leave?

13:00.488 --> 13:01.989
Look around you.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.561
-You're not the Dragon Master anymore.

13:34.563 --> 13:37.316
Okay. Well, I guess I'll just, uh…

13:40.277 --> 13:41.111
Leave.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.209
Hm?

14:41.380 --> 14:42.339
Oh, Po!

14:42.423 --> 14:45.676
Quick, come on in. My poor boy.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.011
Thanks.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.097
-I could really use a--
-A hug?

14:52.141 --> 14:54.685
Yeah, and a bowl of noodles.

14:54.768 --> 14:55.769
Got that too.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.901
Po, everyone's talking.

15:01.984 --> 15:06.155
Oh, things are crazy. The news, the news!

15:07.573 --> 15:10.034
That I accidentally,
not my fault, destroyed a village,

15:10.117 --> 15:13.370
and lost an all-powerful sacred
and historical object, not my fault,

15:13.454 --> 15:16.916
that three bad guys got away with,
kinda-my-fault-but-a-little-not-my-fault?

15:16.999 --> 15:19.376
Uh-huh. And I'm afraid the Emperor…

15:21.295 --> 15:24.590
The Emperor has taken away
your title of Dragon Master.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.383
No!

15:28.093 --> 15:30.387
And, maybe worse,

15:30.471 --> 15:35.225
the dumpling shop returned this box
of Dragon Master Happy Lunch toys.

15:37.311 --> 15:43.067
No!

15:56.205 --> 15:57.539
Uh, Po…

15:57.623 --> 15:59.625
A-Are you expecting company?

16:04.964 --> 16:05.839
It's that bear!

16:05.923 --> 16:08.842
That's one of the bandits
that stole the WuGao Gauntlet.

16:08.926 --> 16:12.096
Why are they coming here?
What do I do? I gotta do something!

16:21.647 --> 16:24.316
You got a lot of nerve
and whatnot, coming here.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.236
-Whoa.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.154
That's a lot of whatnot.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.864
Let's do this. Ha!

16:50.384 --> 16:51.218
Ow!

17:05.691 --> 17:07.276
You stay away from my Po.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.082
Whoa!

17:24.877 --> 17:28.380
-Okay, okay, you win.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.050
Don't kill me.
I haven't written a will or anything,

17:31.133 --> 17:33.302
and I'd hate to have
my action figure collection

17:33.385 --> 17:35.012
go to the wrong person.

17:36.805 --> 17:38.348
I'm not here to kill you.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.100
You're a girl?

17:41.101 --> 17:43.896
-I'm a knight.

17:43.979 --> 17:46.231
Yeah, I mean, that's what I…

17:46.315 --> 17:48.859
Different spelling, I guess. "Knight."

17:48.942 --> 17:52.863
I'm looking for the Dragon Master.
I was told he lives in that house.

17:52.946 --> 17:55.491
Yeah, not sure
the Dragon Master still exists,

17:55.574 --> 17:59.078
but, uh, a couple of days ago,
that would be me.

17:59.953 --> 18:03.040
You? You're the Dragon Master?

18:05.959 --> 18:08.796
The very idiot
that leveled that village.

18:08.879 --> 18:11.173
I was just there
to eat Pei-Pei's fat gobs.

18:11.256 --> 18:14.176
And you let Klaus and Veruca
get away with the gauntlet.

18:14.259 --> 18:17.346
So I've heard. I thought you'd be
all happy your friends got away.

18:17.429 --> 18:18.722
They are not friends.

18:18.806 --> 18:21.100
I'm chasing them. I'm trying to stop them.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.017
What?

18:22.101 --> 18:25.729
My name is Luthera of Landreth,
the Wandering Blade,

18:25.813 --> 18:28.899
Daughter of the Saxon Guard,
Knight of England.

18:29.399 --> 18:30.234
And you?

18:30.818 --> 18:31.819
I'm Po.

18:33.654 --> 18:36.782
That's about all I got right now.
Title pending, so…

18:36.865 --> 18:37.950
By order of the Queen,

18:38.033 --> 18:40.661
I am in pursuit
of Klaus and Veruca DuMont.

18:40.744 --> 18:42.538
Highly dangerous criminals.

18:42.621 --> 18:43.789
They escaped London,

18:43.872 --> 18:47.126
and are in China to locate
the very weapon you let them take.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.210
Accidentally.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.129
Making them extremely powerful.

18:50.212 --> 18:53.966
It could lead to a devastating result
for England, China, and the world.

18:54.049 --> 18:55.425
They must be stopped.

18:55.509 --> 18:58.846
Whoa, this sounds insanely cool. I'm in.

19:00.097 --> 19:00.931
In what?

19:01.014 --> 19:03.600
In this, with you. I'll come with you.

19:03.684 --> 19:06.019
I'd rather slice your guts out,

19:06.103 --> 19:09.523
use them to string a violin,
and play it at your funeral.

19:10.023 --> 19:13.485
Okay, little harsh. Uh…

19:13.569 --> 19:19.408
You got insult game, I'll give you that,
leather-shoulder-pad girl.

19:19.491 --> 19:20.617
Knight.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.328
Knight. But seriously,
I'd be awesome help.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.581
Me, possibly former Dragon Master,

19:25.664 --> 19:28.834
helping a knight from England
track down and capture super bad guys?

19:28.917 --> 19:32.087
And returning the gauntlet would be
a perfect way for me to save face,

19:32.171 --> 19:33.672
earn trust, and regain my title.

19:34.339 --> 19:37.050
Uh, yeah, uh, help England.
Whatever that is.

19:37.634 --> 19:39.970
I'll admit, I haven't made it
to a foreign land yet.

19:40.053 --> 19:41.889
Just between us, I get a little seasick.

19:41.972 --> 19:45.642
Once, I threw up just looking at a cork
in a birdbath. True story. So, yeah?

19:45.726 --> 19:47.477
-I work alone.

19:48.353 --> 19:49.646
Cool. Me too.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.481
We can work alone together.

19:51.565 --> 19:54.651
I can help you. I'm the last person
who saw Kevin and Valerie.

19:54.735 --> 19:55.569
Klaus and Veruca.

19:55.652 --> 19:57.905
I know which way they headed
and how to get there.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.907
And I have this.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.661
The WuGao Gauntlet…

20:04.745 --> 20:05.579
thumb.

20:05.662 --> 20:07.247
-Let me see that.

20:07.331 --> 20:10.459
Me got something you wants.
Me got. You want.

20:12.002 --> 20:14.213
I'll just be keeping this in a safe place.

20:15.339 --> 20:18.008
In… a… safe… place.

20:18.091 --> 20:19.051
Come on now!

20:19.134 --> 20:21.428
That safe place being my thumb.

20:22.512 --> 20:26.058
Look, I left 'em at the Kai Yu River Pass.
Take me, and I'll show you.

20:26.141 --> 20:29.937
I'd rather chop off your furry feet
and use them as earmuffs

20:30.020 --> 20:32.481
while I sink you into a frozen lake.

20:32.564 --> 20:36.860
These are all so complicated
and, uh, violent.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.656
Okay, Wandering Blade. Keep on wandering.

20:40.739 --> 20:44.743
'Cause that's what you'll be doing.
China's a pretty big place.

20:44.826 --> 20:46.870
Most of it, anyway. Toodles.

20:48.538 --> 20:50.374
Hold on.

20:50.457 --> 20:51.833
Yes?

21:00.634 --> 21:03.762
I'll make camp by the elm tree.
I leave in the morning.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.473
-Woohoo! Yes!

21:11.561 --> 21:12.729
Ah…

21:39.506 --> 21:40.716
Is it morning?

21:41.341 --> 21:42.175
No.

21:44.344 --> 21:45.554
Is it morning?

21:45.637 --> 21:46.471
No.

21:49.391 --> 21:50.976
Is it morning? Yes!

21:52.144 --> 21:54.354
See ya, Dad.

21:54.438 --> 21:57.524
Gonna save China and stuff,
and restore my reputation.

21:57.607 --> 22:00.027
Okay, son. Have fun!

22:07.242 --> 22:09.286
Yes, yes, yes!

22:09.369 --> 22:12.039
No, no, no! She's gone!

22:12.122 --> 22:13.540
Luther of Lingo,

22:13.623 --> 22:17.544
the Daughter of Wangland,
something something, is gone!

22:17.627 --> 22:20.797
No!

22:20.881 --> 22:22.382
What's wrong, Po?

22:22.466 --> 22:23.759
I lost something!

22:27.679 --> 22:29.264
And I'm gonna go find it.
