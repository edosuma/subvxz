CHAMPIONS LEAGUE QUARTERFINAL
FC BAYERN VS. PSG - 04/07/21 - FIRST LEG

00:12.360 --> 00:13.800
Let's go!

00:15.840 --> 00:18.360
It's last year's final all over again.

00:18.720 --> 00:22.200
Bayern Munich host Paris Saint-Germain.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.600
Eight months after Lisbon,

00:24.960 --> 00:26.400
they meet again.

00:27.840 --> 00:30.800
Of course the Parisian team
has a score to settle here.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.560
Bayern with Goretzka.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.160
Nice cross to Hernandez.

00:36.600 --> 00:40.000
That should be the first chance
for Bayern Munich. Hernandez!

00:42.120 --> 00:44.960
Great corner kick,
and there's Choupo-Moting.

00:45.320 --> 00:49.400
Good chance. That was another
opportunity for FC Bayern.

00:49.920 --> 00:53.520
Kimmich loses possession
and now PSG attack for the first time,

00:54.240 --> 00:57.920
with Neymar, to Mbappé and he shoots,

00:58.720 --> 01:00.960
and there's the lead for PSG.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.400
1-0.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.120
Why'd you let them through?

01:08.680 --> 01:11.800
Still in possession,
and Sané makes a run,

01:12.160 --> 01:14.400
and lays it off for Pavard …

01:14.800 --> 01:17.760
The team from Munich
are doing their thing.

01:18.160 --> 01:19.840
Whoa, that was close.

01:20.840 --> 01:25.280
And the free kick taken by Kimmich,
there's Goretzka, Goretzka!

01:25.640 --> 01:26.720
No goal!

01:27.160 --> 01:29.040
Paris at the other end.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.960
Neymar to Marquinhos,
that looked off-side.

01:33.360 --> 01:36.480
It's 2-0 and the goal stands.

01:39.240 --> 01:42.440
Two shots, two goals.
- Leon has to come off, right Hansi?

01:42.880 --> 01:46.440
Sub Leon! We've been
one man down for five minutes!

01:47.200 --> 01:49.480
Goretzka has to come off.

01:50.840 --> 01:53.200
And it looks like
Süle will be substituted as well.

01:55.080 --> 01:58.280
What's up Nicky?
- My thigh again, out of the blue.

02:04.760 --> 02:07.080
Boateng with a strong challenge.

02:07.440 --> 02:09.840
Sané … and a shot from Alaba,

02:10.680 --> 02:13.040
and Müller …
Müller from four yards out.

02:14.440 --> 02:17.680
Kimmich to Pavard, nice cross …
Choupo-Moting!

02:18.840 --> 02:21.320
Bayern are back in the game.

02:23.800 --> 02:27.320
It's not over yet, guys.
We had four chances to score!

02:27.760 --> 02:31.680
I feel like I need longer cleats.

02:35.760 --> 02:39.720
Okay, guys.
By all the stats, we are better.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.840
We can't change the score.

02:42.280 --> 02:45.600
But the way we're playing is good.
Except for the two goals.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.720
Guys, stay determined
to get a shot on goal.

02:49.120 --> 02:52.800
Some shots were side-footed,
like you had a bad knee.

02:53.160 --> 02:56.200
Guys, seriously, go for it,
if you see a chance, take it.

03:00.520 --> 03:04.120
It's 8 shots on goal to 2
in the first half, but PSG lead.

03:04.640 --> 03:08.040
FC Bayern continue the pressure,
there's a chance for Pavard.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.600
They're fighting to equalize
and they need to,

03:11.040 --> 03:13.480
or it will be very tight
in the return leg.

03:13.920 --> 03:16.880
Next chance for Bayern,
a Kimmich free kick, Müller …

03:17.320 --> 03:19.760
It's gone in! It's 2-2.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.560
It's all level once again.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.400
A simple victory in the return leg
would suffice. Uh-oh, Draxler!

03:27.760 --> 03:30.680
He slips it through to Di Maria. Mbappé.

03:31.040 --> 03:32.760
Can Boateng keep up?

03:33.120 --> 03:35.280
Mbappé, still Mbappé …

03:36.600 --> 03:38.600
Crap!
- All going wrong today.

03:40.160 --> 03:44.760
23 shots on goal to 4,
yet FC Bayern are losing a game

03:45.120 --> 03:48.000
that they just should not be losing.

04:03.440 --> 04:07.560
Guys, we'll score the goals in Paris,
and we'll be the ones celebrating, okay?

04:07.920 --> 04:10.920
We'll go full of confidence
and play just like tonight,

04:11.280 --> 04:12.840
only this time we'll score. Okay?

05:13.080 --> 05:16.080
Yeah, when I move,
it feels a little bit better.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.920
It's here, mainly.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.720
Hi, Tanguy.

05:21.080 --> 05:24.640
Is it just here or does it
also spread down here?

05:25.040 --> 05:29.520
Do you feel anything in your back
or in your buttocks?

05:29.920 --> 05:31.560
Anything in the groin?
- No.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.560
Turn on your stomach please.

05:37.520 --> 05:40.840
Here, these points,
when I press here, any pain? - No.

05:41.280 --> 05:44.320
Alright. In my opinion
you should be okay for today.

05:44.920 --> 05:45.960
Good.

05:46.320 --> 05:51.320
Leon has a very severe muscle strain.
So there's always tension in the muscle.

05:51.720 --> 05:54.120
It'll be touch-and-go
for the return leg.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.760
The problem is
if we send him back too soon,

05:58.120 --> 06:02.160
there's a risk he'll do some
serious damage to the muscle.

06:02.520 --> 06:06.680
But we will do everything
in our power to enable him to play.

06:08.360 --> 06:11.640
We have a lot of injuries right now,
with Lewandowski,

06:12.160 --> 06:14.560
Niklas Süle and Serge Gnabry.

06:14.960 --> 06:19.680
Then there's also Lucas Hernandez
who has severely bruised ribs.

06:20.080 --> 06:23.880
It's so painful that every breath hurts.

06:24.240 --> 06:28.320
But Lucas is a fighter. He doesn't
really care how painful it is.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.400
He'll do all he can
to get back on the field.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.320
Hey Lucas!

06:40.680 --> 06:44.720
So let's work on you
being able to give interviews soon.

06:45.160 --> 06:47.920
Pre- and post-match. Obviously, right?

06:48.280 --> 06:52.760
We had trouble …
- … getting into the game.

06:53.520 --> 06:55.440
You said earlier …
When are you aggressive?

06:55.800 --> 06:58.440
In a duel. Yes, duel.
- Yes, very good.

06:59.360 --> 07:03.080
My agent called me one day and said

07:03.440 --> 07:05.480
that Bayern were interested.

07:06.680 --> 07:11.720
A week later he told me Hasan wanted
to see me, to meet me in person.

07:12.080 --> 07:14.280
So I met up with him.

07:14.680 --> 07:18.160
Hasan speaks good Spanish,
so we had no trouble communicating.

07:18.520 --> 07:22.880
He's easygoing. In Spain,
sporting directors aren't like Hasan.

07:23.320 --> 07:29.240
Sure, they manage their players,
but they're not with the team every day.

07:29.600 --> 07:33.400
But here the sporting director
mixes with us, just another guy.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.760
So it's like a little family.

07:44.320 --> 07:47.800
Last season we saw
the quality Lucas has on the ball.

07:48.160 --> 07:51.560
His aggressive style
is an enormous asset to our team.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.360
The next step for him
is to become a leader,

07:54.800 --> 07:57.320
then we'll really enjoy having him here.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.760
On our defense,

08:04.120 --> 08:07.400
there are more French defenders
than there are Germans.

08:09.720 --> 08:13.960
I said to Max, instead of German,
please could we speak French.

08:17.920 --> 08:22.520
We're all friends in this group.
There's a really nice atmosphere here.

08:23.520 --> 08:25.320
Tolisso, what a lucky shot.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.240
Coman! Kingsley Coman!

08:31.560 --> 08:33.320
Benjamin Pavard!

08:33.760 --> 08:36.800
I've known these guys since I was a kid.

08:37.160 --> 08:41.480
You're in a foreign country, but then
you find people speak the same language.

08:41.920 --> 08:47.200
It helps you integrate. You feel at home
even though you're abroad.

08:49.440 --> 08:52.320
I like the mentality.
Call it the German mentality,

08:52.760 --> 08:55.520
as they want to win everything.
That's the attitude here.

08:55.880 --> 09:01.640
But we're good friends too and have fun.
We're together often, most of the time.

09:02.560 --> 09:06.280
Bayern have always had French players,
like Lizarazu or Sagnol.

09:06.720 --> 09:10.480
It's the tradition. I don't know why,
but we love Bayern München.

09:21.560 --> 09:24.920
Next year important players are leaving,
like Javi,

09:25.360 --> 09:29.360
like Jérôme, like David.
They're leaders of the team.

09:29.760 --> 09:33.120
So, without these players,
it's obvious that

09:33.480 --> 09:35.680
the team needs to renew itself,

09:36.040 --> 09:40.960
and others take over these roles.
And I'm prepared to take that on.

09:41.520 --> 09:47.480
And to give all I can on the field,
and to be a leader on the field, sure.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.400
APRIL 9, 2021 - 4 DAYS BEFORE SECOND LEG
Hello.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.320
PRESS CONFERENCE SÄBENER STRASSE

10:00.040 --> 10:01.760
Alright?

10:02.120 --> 10:06.000
Hello everyone. So let's get started.
Who was first in line?

10:06.680 --> 10:10.400
Will the club cooperate
regardless of your contract situation

10:10.760 --> 10:12.320
if the DFB approaches you?

10:12.680 --> 10:16.000
The CEO, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge,
has asked everyone

10:16.360 --> 10:19.440
to be calm in this situation.

10:19.800 --> 10:23.920
Mr. Flick, can you imagine the job
of being German national coach?

10:24.680 --> 10:27.640
I know that all of you …

10:28.320 --> 10:33.600
have a job to do, to get as much
information as possible out of Flick

10:33.960 --> 10:38.160
or to be on top of any new development.
I completely understand that.

10:38.520 --> 10:43.000
But please understand that if this
question comes up again in the future,

10:43.360 --> 10:46.280
I will reply, "Next question please."

10:46.640 --> 10:48.600
Because I don't want to hear it.

10:49.360 --> 10:54.600
What I don't quite understand
about this whole routine

10:54.960 --> 10:57.600
is the longer you don't speak clearly,

10:58.360 --> 11:01.920
the longer it remains an issue.
Why don't you stop …

11:02.280 --> 11:04.440
No! Next question please.

11:05.880 --> 11:10.160
At that point you noticed
it was grating. It was obvious.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.560
Hansi's remarks were

11:12.920 --> 11:17.040
very different from the previous season.
You got the impression

11:17.400 --> 11:22.560
he was less a coach and more
a politician or a manager or a diplomat.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.680
That he'd stopped doing what he loves,
being on the field, tinkering,

11:28.040 --> 11:30.520
being close to the team,
and trying things out.

11:30.960 --> 11:35.360
Being head coach is
not necessarily desirable.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.840
I have to be honest.

11:41.240 --> 11:44.760
So let's see who's the prettiest
in this team photo.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.520
People have different tastes.

11:47.880 --> 11:50.680
Okay, then the top three for appearance.

11:51.080 --> 11:53.320
Liza.
- Yes. Okay.

11:53.720 --> 11:55.680
A little compact one.

11:57.080 --> 11:59.080
So, here's my top three.

11:59.520 --> 12:02.800
If we're only talking about looks,
Gerry could be a top model.

12:03.200 --> 12:08.800
Yeah! By Bavarian standards you couldn't
pick a better face to carve in wood.

12:09.240 --> 12:12.720
Ballack has striking features.
- Yeah, he's good-looking.

12:13.080 --> 12:16.720
And Owen isn't bad-looking.
Quite wholesome.

12:17.080 --> 12:19.640
Owen is number one for me.

12:20.680 --> 12:22.320
I think Liza is …

12:22.880 --> 12:26.640
So, number one, two, three …
because he's great.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.680
Gerry is four.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.960
Balle is five.
- Yes.

12:31.320 --> 12:33.480
Let's take off the mask
and have a whiff.

12:34.960 --> 12:37.840
I told you.
- It smells a little bit.

12:38.200 --> 12:40.440
That's the smell of the semi-final.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.360
Why can't we win 2-0 in Paris?

12:43.720 --> 12:47.080
If there's one thing
that distinguishes FC Bayern,

12:47.720 --> 12:51.080
it's that we always come back
after a defeat.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.480
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL - MAY 26, 1999

12:54.840 --> 13:00.360
Welcome to a very special game today.
The Champions League final in Barcelona.

13:00.760 --> 13:04.240
FC Bayern Munich
versus Manchester United.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.800
It would be huge for FC Bayern

13:07.160 --> 13:10.000
to win this European soccer crown again.

13:10.440 --> 13:16.040
It's been 23 years
since FC Bayern last won this title.

13:16.720 --> 13:19.160
That was on the edge of the box.

13:19.600 --> 13:23.040
That will be a free kick
from a very dangerous position.

13:26.600 --> 13:29.120
Basler scores! Goal! Goal! Goal!

13:29.480 --> 13:32.320
Goal! Goal for Basler!

13:32.760 --> 13:35.600
Manchester United
are facing an uphill battle now.

13:35.960 --> 13:39.080
We played a very good game.
We were closer to 2-0

13:39.440 --> 13:41.240
than Man Utd. were to equalizing.

13:41.720 --> 13:45.320
What magic from Scholl
and then he just hits the post.

13:45.680 --> 13:49.880
We clearly dominated the game.
We should have won 4-0.

13:50.440 --> 13:52.800
Bicycle kick hits the bar, unbelievable!

13:53.240 --> 13:57.640
In the 89th minute, the great Pelé
was sitting in the row in front of me,

13:58.000 --> 14:00.480
and he turns and asks me,
"How much longer?"

14:00.840 --> 14:03.920
I said, "One minute,"
and he said, "It's done."

14:04.320 --> 14:06.720
Preparations for the award ceremony
are underway.

14:07.080 --> 14:11.080
Our attendant had already put the
T-shirts and champagne on the bench.

14:11.440 --> 14:13.920
That may have brought us bad luck.

14:15.800 --> 14:17.640
Get rid of it, get rid of it!

14:18.080 --> 14:19.360
Careful! Goal!

14:19.800 --> 14:22.640
Unbelievable! In the 90th minute.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.120
When it went to 1-1, I thought,
"Too bad, now there'll be extra time."

14:29.680 --> 14:32.720
For heaven's sake, not the winner now!
- Beckham …

14:33.600 --> 14:36.320
Sheringham to Solskjaer.
Solskjaer scores!

14:37.240 --> 14:39.600
Manchester United
win the European Cup final

14:40.040 --> 14:42.440
in the most dramatic fashion imaginable.

14:42.800 --> 14:46.400
Bayern fans watching on TV
who were fetching a beer,

14:46.800 --> 14:48.520
going, "Crap, extra time" …

14:48.880 --> 14:51.920
They got back and it was 2-1,
and they hadn't seen the goal.

14:54.200 --> 14:57.680
It looked like a battlefield,
everyone lying on the ground.

14:58.600 --> 15:01.360
That was a dramatic moment.

15:02.680 --> 15:06.920
The most brutal defeat
you can experience.

15:11.080 --> 15:14.360
I have never experienced
such deafening silence in my life.

15:18.560 --> 15:20.640
The despair, the …

15:21.040 --> 15:25.520
"Was that real, did that
really just happen? Is it true?"

15:29.080 --> 15:33.800
When you lose a game like that, you look
at what went wrong, at the mistakes,

15:34.160 --> 15:38.520
but also at how lax we were
in those moments of pressure.

15:38.880 --> 15:41.840
Many teams are destroyed
by an experience like that.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.960
But our players swore
they weren't done yet.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.080
TWO YEARS LATER - HSV VS. FC BAYERN
MAY 19, 2001

15:48.440 --> 15:51.480
The last matchday of
the 2000-2001 season

15:51.840 --> 15:54.720
will be remembered
by generations of fans.

15:55.360 --> 15:58.080
League leaders Bayern faced Hamburg,

15:58.520 --> 16:02.240
while second-placed Schalke
were at home playing Unterhaching.

16:02.680 --> 16:07.240
For reigning champions Bayern, a draw
would suffice to retain the title.

16:09.880 --> 16:12.640
Barbarez with a header
in the 90th minute.

16:13.080 --> 16:14.840
Oh my goodness.

16:16.680 --> 16:19.560
Bayern staff collapse on the bench.

16:19.920 --> 16:22.400
Losing the title at the last second.

16:22.760 --> 16:25.320
What were the gods of soccer thinking?

16:25.920 --> 16:29.040
This is how the result in Hamburg
was received in Gelsenkirchen.

16:29.480 --> 16:31.160
Blue and white ecstasy.

16:36.880 --> 16:39.080
The boys were ready to give up.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.400
Sammy Kuffour was lying down.
I said, "Sammy,

16:42.760 --> 16:46.600
we're not lying down,
we have four minutes left."

16:46.960 --> 16:50.640
I told Effenberg, "We have four minutes,
you know what that means.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.560
In four minutes,
you can score two goals, if not more."

16:56.280 --> 16:58.480
That was the learning process.

16:58.840 --> 17:02.360
Manchester Utd. had shown us
how it's done two years earlier.

17:02.720 --> 17:07.920
They scored twice in three minutes.
So why couldn't we score once in four?

17:11.240 --> 17:16.760
Then we forced Hamburg to play
a back pass under pressure again.

17:17.120 --> 17:20.640
And then that incredible scene.
If you think of that now …

17:21.240 --> 17:23.520
And Kahn goes wading in.

17:23.880 --> 17:28.560
He's motivated to the end.
He's going to show the whole world.

17:29.080 --> 17:33.160
Is it true you wanted to take
the free kick yourself? - Naturally.

17:33.760 --> 17:34.720
Why not?

17:35.560 --> 17:40.360
He ran around like an animal.
Like a predator intimidating his prey.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.160
Then Effenberg comes up and says,

17:43.600 --> 17:47.640
"Out of the way. Let Patrik shoot."
Patrik Andersson. And I said, "Why him?"

17:48.080 --> 17:51.920
He said Patrik had the hardest shot.
Alright. Good point.

17:52.720 --> 17:56.200
League title or the next tragedy?
Andersson … Goal!

17:56.560 --> 17:59.160
It's in! I don't believe it.

18:01.840 --> 18:05.080
That's Bayern, they'll score a goal
in the last minute.

18:05.440 --> 18:07.960
They believe in themselves
till the last minute.

18:08.320 --> 18:13.520
When the others give up,
call it a day, or throw in the towel,

18:13.880 --> 18:16.360
Bayern always keep believing.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.640
Fucking Bayern.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.120
You don't just learn from defeat.

18:25.480 --> 18:30.800
FC Bayern proved that. More than
anything you also learn from success,

18:31.160 --> 18:32.880
because success breeds success.

18:33.240 --> 18:36.480
And you will find that nowhere
more so than here.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.480
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL

18:38.840 --> 18:42.760
The entire world of soccer
is watching this final.

18:43.120 --> 18:47.760
This time it could work out
for Ottmar Hitzfeld and his team.

18:48.120 --> 18:51.520
Two years ago it was so damn close
for FC Bayern Munich,

18:51.920 --> 18:53.880
and it didn't work out.

18:54.320 --> 18:58.040
I think our victory in Hamburg
enabled us

18:58.400 --> 19:01.160
to be successful in this final.

19:01.880 --> 19:06.400
Even just the banner saying,
"Today is a good day to make history".

19:06.840 --> 19:10.160
That was really cool. I mean, wow!
I still get goosebumps.

19:11.920 --> 19:15.840
Bustling, nudging, what a mess!
What will the referee do?

19:16.200 --> 19:18.320
He points to the penalty spot.

19:18.840 --> 19:23.120
Like in a movie, first everyone's flat
on their face and everything goes wrong.

19:23.560 --> 19:28.600
Then there's a great journey with many
challenges. But it doesn't go smoothly.

19:36.920 --> 19:39.400
And there's another penalty kick.

19:39.760 --> 19:43.680
And Bayern have the chance
to level the score. No!

19:45.400 --> 19:48.680
The bad movie continues. Unbelievable!

19:51.040 --> 19:53.440
Again the ref points to the spot.

19:58.320 --> 20:01.720
The score is one all after 120 minutes.

20:02.560 --> 20:07.520
The pressure was on because
before me Paulo Sergio missed.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.400
This is a never-ending story.

20:13.240 --> 20:16.280
I took the ball.
I walked over and I knew I'd score.

20:17.880 --> 20:19.560
Goal! Goal! Goal!

20:20.000 --> 20:22.160
FC Bayern are back on top!

20:25.320 --> 20:27.960
Kahn makes the save,
and it's level again.

20:28.880 --> 20:29.680
Great!

20:31.200 --> 20:34.400
And Kahn tips it on to the bar
and it's a save!

20:35.320 --> 20:37.160
Boys, please, please,

20:37.520 --> 20:40.640
after 25 years,
please bring the cup home.

20:42.040 --> 20:44.840
Pellegrino versus Kahn.

20:47.120 --> 20:50.000
FC Bayern! It's FC Bayern!

20:50.400 --> 20:53.400
We've won the cup! Unbelievable.

20:53.760 --> 20:56.640
I can't believe it. Bayern!

20:57.000 --> 21:01.720
We've been waiting for this since 1976.

21:10.400 --> 21:16.000
As Bayern Munich, we have to
rely heavily on our culture of winning.

21:16.360 --> 21:20.240
On this mind-set that gets lived out
at this club.

21:20.600 --> 21:24.920
PSG and Manchester City
still haven't won the Champions League.

21:25.320 --> 21:28.480
The ability to win
is something you can't buy,

21:28.840 --> 21:33.960
it can only be passed down
from generation to generation.

21:34.360 --> 21:38.400
APRIL 11, 2021
TWO DAYS BEFORE THE SECOND LEG

21:41.560 --> 21:45.160
Our performance in the first leg
against PSG was great actually,

21:45.520 --> 21:49.400
as we created lots of opportunities,
but we got punished for two mistakes.

21:50.080 --> 21:53.640
With the same commitment
and a little luck, anything is possible.

21:54.760 --> 21:58.160
We're very focused.
I think you can see that in the team.

21:58.600 --> 22:02.880
In Paris we have every chance
of reaching the semifinals.

22:03.560 --> 22:04.880
Aside from knowing

22:05.440 --> 22:07.520
that we have to score
at least two goals,

22:08.240 --> 22:12.360
we're approaching the game very
positively. We're in good spirits.

22:14.720 --> 22:18.880
After the first game, I was very angry
and disappointed with the result.

22:19.240 --> 22:22.800
But I'm sure
we'll take them out in Paris.

22:26.200 --> 22:28.240
Let's talk about the Super League.

22:28.600 --> 22:31.880
Celebrated by its creators, criticized
by fans and canceled by the clubs.

22:32.240 --> 22:35.800
Here's the short story
of the Super League that for 60 hours

22:36.160 --> 22:37.960
rocked European soccer.

22:38.320 --> 22:41.720
What we've seen in the wake
of the Super League fiasco

22:42.120 --> 22:46.760
is that some clubs were actually willing
to leave their national leagues.

22:47.120 --> 22:52.400
In regard to Bayern Munich and the DFL,
that would be unthinkable.

22:52.800 --> 22:56.400
I'm no hypocrite. I like to have
games against Real Madrid.

22:56.840 --> 23:00.880
But I think it's also
important that Bayern Munich

23:01.240 --> 23:06.440
play in places that are out of the way.

23:06.840 --> 23:08.560
BOARD MEETING

23:08.920 --> 23:12.520
I'd like to take another look
back at the Super League.

23:13.160 --> 23:16.960
I think the decision we made together
was absolutely correct,

23:17.360 --> 23:20.640
and once again we see
how different soccer is from business.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.240
Nobody was invited or informed.

23:23.600 --> 23:26.760
None of those highly decorated people
considered

23:27.120 --> 23:30.560
that something like this
should be done differently.

23:30.920 --> 23:33.160
I find it unbelievably stupid.

23:33.840 --> 23:37.160
Have you been … - Yes,
I've been in constant contact with UEFA.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.560
I just had another talk
with the president.

23:39.920 --> 23:44.920
I don't know anyone who is
as well-connected internationally

23:45.280 --> 23:46.920
as Karl-Heinz Rummenigge.

23:47.280 --> 23:51.120
It's been good for us all,
but especially for FC Bayern.

23:56.240 --> 23:59.680
When Karl-Heinz Rummenigge
joined the Bayern Munich board,

24:00.080 --> 24:04.640
he realized right away that soccer is
becoming more and more international.

24:06.280 --> 24:08.720
Kalle is the diplomat,
the foreign minister.

24:09.120 --> 24:14.240
His experience and the network
that he has are priceless for the club.

24:19.320 --> 24:23.120
He's also one of the few
real world-class players

24:23.480 --> 24:25.200
to become CEO of a top club.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.200
The decisive criterion

24:27.560 --> 24:32.640
is that Italian and Spanish soccer
suffer from huge cash flow problems.

24:33.080 --> 24:37.360
The bottom line is simply
that we all have to lower the bar.

24:37.760 --> 24:39.560
We have to reduce costs

24:39.960 --> 24:43.560
and rationalize things
that we once considered irrational.

24:44.760 --> 24:48.040
Even at 17 I wasn't sure I wanted
to be a professional player.

24:48.440 --> 24:53.040
I went to school to get a regular job as
a bank clerk at the Volksbank Lippstadt,

24:53.400 --> 24:55.240
but of course I played soccer.

24:57.600 --> 25:01.400
After talks with Bayern Munich,
all the other clubs came to me

25:01.760 --> 25:05.960
and said I shouldn't go to
Bayern Munich, I wouldn't have a chance.

25:06.320 --> 25:09.200
Hoeneß, Breitner,
Maier, Müller play there,

25:09.560 --> 25:12.200
and of course Franz Beckenbauer.

25:13.320 --> 25:18.160
Franz brought a new era to soccer,
by appearing at the Vienna Opera Ball,

25:18.600 --> 25:21.560
the Wagner Festival in Bayreuth
and so on.

25:21.920 --> 25:25.840
That was totally unheard of
for a footballer.

25:27.280 --> 25:32.360
He turned out in a tux, and he made
soccer acceptable to polite society.

25:34.360 --> 25:38.680
Red cheeks! We called him red cheeks.
That was Karl-Heinz's nickname.

25:40.320 --> 25:44.880
Karl-Heinz was very shy. He needed
support. I'll never forget, in Glasgow

25:45.320 --> 25:48.640
against St. Etienne,
that was his first final.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.040
He was so nervous. So we told him
to drink a whisky before the game.

25:53.440 --> 25:55.400
"That will help to calm you down."

25:55.760 --> 25:59.440
Yeah! He was always very, very nervous.

25:59.800 --> 26:05.080
Back in the hotel I passed a group
of journalists around Franz Beckenbauer.

26:05.520 --> 26:09.360
They asked him if he thought
there was anyone on the team

26:09.720 --> 26:12.080
who could take his place
when he was gone.

26:12.520 --> 26:18.080
And he said, "Sure, there's Karl-Heinz
Rummenigge, but he's a sausage."

26:18.480 --> 26:23.000
I was just walking past him
at that exact moment,

26:23.360 --> 26:27.200
and I was very surprised by his reply.
I was utterly perplexed.

26:27.640 --> 26:32.280
But he really started a fire inside me,
and I thought, "I'll show you!"

26:42.160 --> 26:45.840
Outstanding performance from Rummenigge,
and that makes it 1-0.

26:47.080 --> 26:50.920
He was a terrific footballer,
one of the best of his time.

26:55.840 --> 26:58.040
Karl-Heinz was an exceptional player,

26:58.440 --> 27:00.320
incredibly resilient,

27:00.680 --> 27:04.240
physically strong,
and he had amazing ball control.

27:06.600 --> 27:08.600
Here comes Rummenigge.

27:09.400 --> 27:12.720
The "Breitnigge" duo,
when he and Paul Breitner teamed up.

27:13.160 --> 27:16.280
A one-two between
Rummenigge and Breitner …

27:16.640 --> 27:18.320
Rummenigge makes it 1-0!

27:26.840 --> 27:30.600
It started with Franz
that soccer became a people business,

27:31.560 --> 27:33.320
and then it was me in the '80s.

27:36.160 --> 27:38.720
Karl-Heinz Rummenigge
- What a man

27:39.160 --> 27:41.480
Rummenigge, Rummenigge
- I'm a fan

27:41.920 --> 27:44.400
Karl-Heinz Rummenigge
- He's so strong

27:44.840 --> 27:47.400
Rummenigge, Rummenigge all night long

27:47.760 --> 27:50.560
Rummenigge, Rummenigge all night long

27:50.920 --> 27:53.000
And then all of a sudden

27:53.360 --> 27:57.320
my private life became part of it.
I've never had a problem with that.

27:57.720 --> 28:02.800
I think when you play soccer
you have to accept privacy is relative.

28:05.720 --> 28:07.440
More!
- More?

28:07.800 --> 28:10.880
In both the '70s and '80s in Germany,

28:11.240 --> 28:16.880
soccer was still a very peripheral
part of society in the media.

28:17.240 --> 28:21.000
Rummenigge was European player
of the year, multiple golden boot-winner

28:21.360 --> 28:24.640
and the star of his time,
also on the Germany team.

28:25.040 --> 28:28.960
And of course he got many offers
from other clubs, and from abroad.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.520
Mr. Rummenigge, ZDF,
can I ask a question?

28:31.880 --> 28:33.720
No. Not about that subject.

28:34.080 --> 28:37.360
But then there was this incredible offer
from Inter Milan,

28:37.760 --> 28:39.880
and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge left the club.

28:40.320 --> 28:43.960
And with this transfer,
he and Uli Hoeneß

28:44.320 --> 28:47.400
were able to save FC Bayern financially.

28:48.080 --> 28:52.280
Tuesday, Milan. The new Inter president,
Ernesto Pellegrini,

28:52.680 --> 28:55.040
finally puts an end to the rumors.

28:56.920 --> 29:01.000
Karl-Heinz Rummenigge will now wear
the blue-black jersey of Inter.

29:04.080 --> 29:07.280
I don't think there is a favorite,
Napoli are a good team.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.680
He's a great guy and a good friend.
- Blonds are good-looking.

29:14.520 --> 29:20.200
I had a great time as a footballer,
but by the time a player is 34 or 35,

29:20.560 --> 29:23.560
your time is over
and you have to let go.

29:25.200 --> 29:29.160
Then in 1991 I got the SOS call
from FC Bayern Munich.

29:31.840 --> 29:34.520
Protest and turmoil in the stands.

29:36.720 --> 29:41.960
There was trouble on the sporting side.
The financial situation wasn't great.

29:42.400 --> 29:45.680
Up to 70,000 fans used to come.
Today there were 18,000.

29:46.520 --> 29:51.280
FC Bayern asked Franz Beckenbauer and me
if we'd get the ship back on course.

29:51.640 --> 29:53.840
Thus two ex-players came back on board.

29:59.160 --> 30:02.960
God gave me the talent
for my first career as a player

30:03.360 --> 30:04.960
when I was born.

30:05.360 --> 30:09.600
But for my second career,
I had no natural-born talent,

30:09.960 --> 30:12.480
so I'm grateful to
the people at the time

30:12.840 --> 30:16.080
who supported me, challenged me
and above all trusted me.

30:16.880 --> 30:19.080
How're we doing this? Are we recording?

30:19.440 --> 30:21.920
No, we are broadcasting,
and this is live.

30:22.280 --> 30:24.480
I first came here when I was 18.

30:24.880 --> 30:28.240
Now I've been with Bayern Munich
for over 46 years.

30:29.240 --> 30:33.160
This is my last year.
I look back with joy and pride,

30:33.520 --> 30:35.560
and I look ahead with curiosity.

30:35.920 --> 30:39.640
Because luckily my health is good,
I have a wonderful family,

30:40.000 --> 30:44.280
I have good friends, and I enjoy
some nice hobbies. I'm curious.

30:44.720 --> 30:47.400
He's dreaming! That's all I have to say.

30:47.800 --> 30:50.400
If he sleeps in every morning,

30:50.760 --> 30:55.000
and reads the paper at the
breakfast table for a bit longer,

30:55.440 --> 30:59.000
he'll soon realize
what a difference it is,

30:59.360 --> 31:04.160
and at the beginning at least, he'll
really miss it a lot, without a doubt.

31:08.040 --> 31:11.840
APRIL 12, 2021
ONE DAY BEFORE THE SECOND LEG

31:13.480 --> 31:17.480
Warm up for the first two minutes,
then meet over there.

31:17.840 --> 31:21.040
Leon needs tests,
to see if he can play in Paris,

31:21.400 --> 31:23.360
if it makes sense for him to travel.

31:23.800 --> 31:26.560
And then a quick change on one side.

31:26.960 --> 31:30.760
Lucas Hernandez is another injured
player, but that's just a pain issue.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.840
Push harder. Good.

31:33.200 --> 31:37.280
We're assuming that
he'll tell us he will be available.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.760
Everything okay, Leon?
- Yes. Two more.

31:40.120 --> 31:43.560
Okay, go on, but don't overdo it.
- Yes, I know.

31:43.920 --> 31:47.480
Let's wait till tomorrow
and then we'll go from there.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.120
I don't want to take any risks.

31:49.720 --> 31:53.200
I really think I can do it.
- Let's just wait and see.

32:05.600 --> 32:09.560
Robert, they're in order of importance.
- What?

32:10.000 --> 32:13.800
It starts with Süle's stuff and then …
- Süle, yes, you're right.

32:14.160 --> 32:17.640
He works harder than all of us.
- That's right.

32:20.040 --> 32:23.160
Süle! Half man, half beast.

32:26.960 --> 32:29.680
I'll give you 20 seconds.
- What?

32:30.040 --> 32:33.040
Get moving, pumpkin!
- You're late!

32:39.280 --> 32:41.520
Let's work the thighs.

32:45.120 --> 32:46.280
Hey.
- What?

32:46.640 --> 32:48.000
90 degrees.

32:48.360 --> 32:51.280
It is.
- That's 70 degrees tops.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.320
Bring your angle gauge.
- It's missing by that much.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.720
I'm not in the mood for a lesson.

32:59.840 --> 33:04.120
BAYERN IN SHOCK LOSS TO PSG
IN QUARTERFINAL FIRST LEG

33:04.480 --> 33:07.560
I know you won't want to discuss
your coach's future,

33:07.920 --> 33:11.160
but there's definitely a strange
mood about this game.

33:11.520 --> 33:14.200
When I was a boy, we had "FC Hollywood".

33:14.720 --> 33:20.440
It wasn't due to events on the field,
it was due to reports of other aspects.

33:20.800 --> 33:25.080
So whenever there's turbulence,
that's a compliment to journalists.

33:25.520 --> 33:28.000
On the other hand,
I know you all well enough

33:28.360 --> 33:32.160
to realize you won't stop asking
just because we win in Paris.

33:32.600 --> 33:37.040
Jérôme Boateng's contract won't be
renewed. How do you view that decision?

33:37.480 --> 33:40.440
Jérôme and I have been through a lot,

33:40.800 --> 33:46.440
but it's completely wrong for players
to comment on transfers

33:46.840 --> 33:50.160
or on contractual matters.

33:50.960 --> 33:54.880
Or things would get out of hand like …
they are doing.

33:57.920 --> 34:00.360
Crap. Now I've put my foot in it.

34:03.560 --> 34:08.120
Crap. Now I've put my foot in it.
Right, so …

34:11.240 --> 34:14.800
What a bonehead.
- I realized what I was saying …

34:16.000 --> 34:20.280
FC Hollywood,
I was a co-founder of FC Hollywood.

34:20.720 --> 34:25.400
Or not the co-founder, but I was there
when FC Hollywood was created.

34:26.040 --> 34:27.200
Are you ready?

34:27.640 --> 34:32.760
I think there have never been so many
alpha males and characters in one place!

34:42.280 --> 34:44.200
We have to get a better grip
on our players.

34:44.840 --> 34:47.120
All bottle empty!
- We're top of the table.

34:48.240 --> 34:50.000
What liberty you take!

34:51.480 --> 34:53.000
That's an outrage!

34:53.360 --> 34:58.000
Then in the '90s there was this huge
influx of private TV stations in Germany

34:58.400 --> 35:02.760
and they were prepared to spend lots
of money on soccer as entertainment.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.520
So suddenly the players
also became pop stars.

35:07.720 --> 35:09.960
I knew this would come up.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.120
I have all I want, I can buy all I want

35:13.480 --> 35:15.960
and I have a pretty girlfriend.

35:17.560 --> 35:20.760
Journalists only asked about
what happened last night

35:21.120 --> 35:23.520
and not about the next match.

35:24.560 --> 35:27.080
It was all about partying
or the Oktoberfest.

35:29.040 --> 35:33.720
It fits FC Bayern. And it's Munich,
it's always fun. It never gets boring.

35:36.520 --> 35:40.160
I'm not someone who'll put up with that.
Mark my words.

35:44.680 --> 35:47.320
It was the best time I've had
at Bayern Munich.

35:49.800 --> 35:53.200
Personally, I never found
the expression negative.

35:53.560 --> 35:56.360
Because soccer is also …

35:56.920 --> 36:00.600
I know a lot of people
will throw their hands up in horror …

36:01.040 --> 36:04.040
Yes, but football is also entertainment.

36:13.160 --> 36:14.200
B!

36:17.760 --> 36:19.960
We have to use elevator B.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.760
Looks like I'm the first one here.

36:29.480 --> 36:30.680
What now?

36:31.680 --> 36:34.600
Seems my room key hasn't been activated.

36:36.600 --> 36:40.800
Five past. Normally there'd be
30 people sitting here eating.

36:41.200 --> 36:44.600
The Bayern players are
too stupid to take the elevator.

36:44.960 --> 36:47.120
The instructions are too difficult.

36:52.480 --> 36:54.600
Then I'll just wait a little.

36:57.160 --> 36:58.200
Oh, crap.

36:58.600 --> 37:02.400
9 HOURS BEFORE THE SECOND LEG

37:09.760 --> 37:12.680
We're doing a small training session
with Leon,

37:13.040 --> 37:15.680
who says he has some hamstring niggles.

37:16.040 --> 37:20.600
We have to stimulate the muscle,
build up tension, and see if it works.

37:20.960 --> 37:24.840
And then we'll see
if that's enough for tonight or not.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.920
Are they doing the whole setup?

37:28.360 --> 37:31.680
Good old cones.
- That's life as a coach, huh?

37:32.160 --> 37:34.040
Guess that's right.

37:36.880 --> 37:39.040
Chest, then inside, and again.

37:39.440 --> 37:43.840
And left.
Go, go, go! That's it. Keep going.

37:46.760 --> 37:48.680
It feels a bit off.

38:01.800 --> 38:06.720
PARIS CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT
3 HOURS BEFORE THE SECOND LEG

38:13.920 --> 38:16.240
We have the discussion
about Hansi Flick.

38:16.680 --> 38:18.640
Normally there would be no discussion.

38:19.080 --> 38:22.200
We have a contract with Hansi Flick
and his contract lasts

38:22.560 --> 38:26.640
until at least the end
of the 2021-22 season.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.600
On the other hand, Hansi hasn't

38:31.000 --> 38:35.840
clarified his position regarding
his contract or his future at the club.

38:37.040 --> 38:41.120
As we're responsible,
we're a bit uneasy about this situation.

38:41.480 --> 38:46.000
He's won everything there is to win,
then suddenly the national team calls.

38:46.760 --> 38:51.440
I totally understand that this is
something that you want to consider.

38:51.880 --> 38:57.000
That said, the only thing that interests
me is what's best for the club.

38:57.400 --> 39:00.360
In Munich I learned

39:00.720 --> 39:04.400
that the club is the boss.

39:04.760 --> 39:08.240
So the club always will remain
and you are just a part of the period.

39:08.600 --> 39:11.080
So when the club decides,
you have to do it.

39:11.440 --> 39:14.920
It's not for the player or the manager
to say, "No, I don't want to it."

39:15.280 --> 39:19.320
It's, "No, no. The club said you have to
do it. You are going to do it. Shut up!"

39:19.760 --> 39:23.440
I intended to quit in 2001. I told Uli
and he said, "Are you crazy?

39:23.800 --> 39:26.920
That's out of the question.
You're staying!" And that was that.

39:33.520 --> 39:36.400
You always tell yourself to be positive.

39:36.800 --> 39:40.840
You push yourself, and if you see
somebody isn't pushing, kick their ass.

39:41.240 --> 39:45.520
Go into the duels, and sometimes
it will hurt, but it doesn't matter.

39:45.920 --> 39:48.200
Go full speed ahead
until the last second.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.960
Full throttle.
- Are you ready?

39:51.400 --> 39:52.560
To go on?

39:56.520 --> 39:58.120
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE QUARTERFINAL

39:58.480 --> 40:02.720
And welcome to the second leg
of the Champions League quarterfinal

40:03.120 --> 40:08.000
between PSG and FC Bayern Munich. It
will be hard for the defending champions

40:08.400 --> 40:10.520
after the 3-2 defeat in the first leg.

40:10.960 --> 40:14.840
They need
at least two goals to advance here.

40:21.560 --> 40:25.480
That's Kimmich,
with the first chance in this match.

40:29.040 --> 40:33.680
Neymar goes to ground.
One roll, another roll …

40:34.080 --> 40:35.640
It didn't look that bad.

40:38.360 --> 40:40.440
But he's still down.

40:43.320 --> 40:47.440
Great ball to Mbappé.
The first chance for PSG. Just wide.

40:51.280 --> 40:53.720
Di Maria against Davis.

40:54.080 --> 40:57.240
And Di Maria needs
medical attention immediately.

40:59.320 --> 41:02.440
It's not only Hansi Flick
who doesn't understand that.

41:04.040 --> 41:07.120
That gained them a minute and a half.

41:09.240 --> 41:13.960
Navas wants to speed things up, but
Boateng robs Neymar, Choupo-Moting …

41:14.520 --> 41:17.680
Sané, this is a big chance
for FC Bayern.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.480
Just wide.

41:23.480 --> 41:27.480
Great play. Mbappé finds Neymar …

41:27.920 --> 41:30.840
Hits the post! Lucky for FC Bayern.

41:31.800 --> 41:35.600
Great pass to Coman,
Alaba takes over …

41:36.600 --> 41:40.640
Here's a chance for Kimmich,
but he can't control the ball.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.240
And the referee doesn't blow for a foul.

41:46.040 --> 41:48.160
Again Neymar passes to Mbappé.

41:48.600 --> 41:50.920
These two work like a machine together.

41:51.320 --> 41:52.840
Neymar's shot hits the bar.

41:54.320 --> 41:57.440
It's a high-tempo match now. Coman …

41:57.840 --> 42:01.360
Müller, Alaba shoots, but Navas saves,
and there's Choupo-Moting!

42:02.520 --> 42:04.960
1-0 for Bayern!

42:06.320 --> 42:09.520
They're one goal away
from the Champions League semifinal.

42:18.600 --> 42:22.840
Believe in yourselves, guys.
Stick at it, stick at it.

42:23.200 --> 42:27.800
All the 50-50 balls in the first half
went their way. Now they'll go our way.

42:28.280 --> 42:31.640
Believe me, they're scared they'll lose
and be knocked out.

42:32.280 --> 42:34.880
Guys, this is our big chance.

42:35.600 --> 42:38.920
Dig deep, the last reserves,
for that one shot.

42:39.440 --> 42:42.640
One goal.
We need one more goal, guys. One goal.

42:46.600 --> 42:49.720
The second half is underway,
between PSG and Bayern.

42:50.520 --> 42:54.360
Sané with a nice cross,
and Coman with a header.

42:55.920 --> 42:57.240
Neymar …

42:58.640 --> 43:04.600
Mbappé, Di Maria, that's a big chance.
What a cool clearance by Boateng.

43:09.520 --> 43:12.320
Mbappé, but Neuer does his Neuer thing.

43:14.840 --> 43:17.920
That's Diallo and
another stoppage for injury.

43:18.480 --> 43:22.120
Screw this, I don't believe this.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.880
Without a touch from anyone.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.560
What is this team like?

43:27.920 --> 43:31.200
But PSG have all the time
in the world now, of course,

43:31.640 --> 43:33.360
as it runs out for Bayern.

43:35.080 --> 43:36.600
Oh no! No!

43:39.600 --> 43:42.440
Yellow card for Müller.
- I don't believe it.

43:46.280 --> 43:50.000
One goal, Bayern just need
one goal to advance.

43:52.280 --> 43:55.840
Kimmich wins possession. Musiala,
now they can move it quickly.

43:56.200 --> 43:58.960
Bayern push forward to get
that much-needed goal.

43:59.320 --> 44:00.680
Sané.

44:01.040 --> 44:03.480
Great play, Leroy Sané …

44:04.320 --> 44:06.560
But Navas says no.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.040
Ref! Ref! Ref!

44:15.400 --> 44:20.040
Kaylor Navas …
Oh, and he points to his shoulder.

44:20.960 --> 44:23.320
Hey! This is unbelievable!

44:23.680 --> 44:25.920
He's hurt.

44:27.280 --> 44:29.240
No. He's hurt.

44:33.680 --> 44:36.320
Well, I'm really at a loss for words.

44:57.840 --> 44:59.080
De puta madre!

45:10.920 --> 45:12.720
Hey, that's too much.
- Too much?

45:15.640 --> 45:17.640
Okay, that's football …

45:18.240 --> 45:20.200
In the final we lost, and now you lost.

45:36.760 --> 45:40.440
I think when every banner says
"Respect" and "Fair Play",

45:40.800 --> 45:43.000
people should set that example.

45:43.360 --> 45:45.440
In fact I'm very glad

45:45.920 --> 45:48.840
that I was on the losing side
in this case.

45:49.240 --> 45:52.520
I wouldn't trade
for any money in the world.

45:53.520 --> 45:57.440
Jérôme, Javi and David
simply didn't deserve that,

45:57.840 --> 46:03.320
because they really created an era here,
and that's it with Champions League now,

46:03.680 --> 46:06.120
and I really feel for them.

46:08.480 --> 46:10.000
I wanted it badly.

46:10.360 --> 46:14.520
My final Champions League match,
it's sad, it's a shame. Bitter.

46:20.880 --> 46:23.600
Have you decided on your future now?

46:24.000 --> 46:26.240
I have just decided, yes.

46:26.600 --> 46:31.840
We've just been eliminated
in the quarterfinals, so …

46:32.200 --> 46:35.840
What have I been thinking?
I've been thinking about the team

46:36.200 --> 46:38.440
and what to say after the final whistle.

46:38.800 --> 46:42.080
I was upset too,
also about the refereeing.

46:42.440 --> 46:43.760
Yeah …

46:44.120 --> 46:46.880
That's not for me to comment on,
we're fair losers.

46:47.240 --> 46:51.760
Although there were a few things
that I really don't understand.
