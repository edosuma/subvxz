WEBVTT

00:10.120 --> 00:11.189
WEST BUNE, TEXAS

00:11.200 --> 00:15.489
There's a man going around taking names

00:15.830 --> 00:19.789
And he decides who to free
and who to blame

00:21.290 --> 00:24.862
Everybody won't be treated all the same

00:26.160 --> 00:29.994
There'll be a golden ladder reaching down

00:32.540 --> 00:35.532
When the man comes around

00:41.910 --> 00:46.074
You wake me again tonight
and it'll be the chainsaw for you.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.825
This is Unit Two responding
to the explosion at the Norris place.

01:55.700 --> 01:59.488
Go ahead, Unit Two.
-We got one DOA.

02:01.120 --> 02:03.497
I think it's Rod Norris.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.115
Send EMS and Fire.

02:06.160 --> 02:09.323
-Heck, send everybody.
-They're on their way.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.745
Hi. My name's Spencer, and I'm...

02:32.370 --> 02:34.247
I don't really know what I am.

02:34.250 --> 02:37.287
-Hel|o, Spencer.
-Hi, Spencer.

02:37.290 --> 02:38.939
This is my first meeting.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.611
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

02:40.620 --> 02:42.611
Thanks. Thank you.

02:43.950 --> 02:49.991
I guess I know
I had a problem with Dilaudid,

02:50.000 --> 02:52.651
but I stopped.

02:54.250 --> 02:56.901
Like, 10 months ago, I stopped.

02:56.910 --> 03:00.994
I thought it was over,
but recently I've really been...

03:02.000 --> 03:08.610
Your literature uses the term "craving."
It started like a month ago.

03:08.620 --> 03:14.195
A suspect was murdered in front of me.
A kid.

03:14.200 --> 03:18.079
And I thought that I could save the kid,
but I couldn't, and...

03:20.950 --> 03:22.690
Sorry. I'm sorry.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.690
I've seen a lot of that stuff before,

03:25.700 --> 03:31.696
but for some reason, that kid's face
has really stuck in my brain.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.497
You know? It's really...I can't...

03:36.870 --> 03:41.489
And I want to forget about him.

03:41.500 --> 03:45.288
And I just want to escape.

03:47.330 --> 03:50.822
I'm sorry. I have to go. I'm sorry.

03:54.040 --> 03:56.861
Spencen
-Sorry, I'm late.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.247
Places to go

04:03.160 --> 04:04.991
You know who I am?

04:05.000 --> 04:08.993
Of course I do, sir.
I just...I didn't expect to see a man

04:09.000 --> 04:12.037
of your position here.

04:12.040 --> 04:16.079
Here, there's no "sirs."
I'm just "John" here.

04:16.080 --> 04:18.366
And this is not something
you talk about at the office,

04:18.370 --> 04:20.190
especially our office.

04:21.080 --> 04:25.039
-I'm sorry. I really do have to go.
-Here. Here, take this.

04:26.750 --> 04:30.493
That's my one-year medallion.
It took me six years to get it.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.697
For the past 13 years,
I've never left home without it.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.907
Because I know if I forget that,

04:35.910 --> 04:39.619
I'll lose my gun, my credentials,
my home. Everything.

04:40.910 --> 04:42.696
Hold on to it.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.444
I only have 10 months.

04:46.330 --> 04:47.900
I know.

04:47.910 --> 04:51.539
-It's your most prized possession.
-It is.

04:51.540 --> 04:54.441
-You're just giving it to me?
-No.

04:54.450 --> 04:56.361
In a couple of months
when you get your year,

04:56.370 --> 04:58.076
you give it back to me.

04:58.950 --> 05:01.862
-I really don't understand.
-You will.

05:10.660 --> 05:14.824
Officer Letts shot this
just before he was killed.

05:14.830 --> 05:17.617
Sorry I'm late.
-I hope she was worth it.

05:17.620 --> 05:19.781
-I hope it was a she.
-I'm sorry, I was at the movies.

05:19.790 --> 05:21.655
Oh, really

05:21.660 --> 05:24.242
Well, I had to leave early,
so I can't really...

05:25.450 --> 05:29.284
I know it's late, I know we're tired,
but we've got two dead cops.

05:29.290 --> 05:31.827
All right.
The resident, Rod Norris, was DOA.

05:31.830 --> 05:34.697
They're still trying to ID the remains
of the second victim,

05:34.700 --> 05:38.443
whom they believe
is his 16-year-old daughter, Jordan.

05:38.450 --> 05:39.781
From the condition of the remains,

05:39.790 --> 05:41.906
she would have had to have been
inside the house,

05:41.910 --> 05:43.866
close to the source of the blast.

05:43.870 --> 05:46.942
Clearly they used the bombing
to set the officers up for an ambush.

05:46.950 --> 05:48.781
That's a well-established
terrorist tactic.

05:48.790 --> 05:50.405
First wave takes out civilians,

05:50.410 --> 05:52.196
the second wave
takes out first responders.

05:52.200 --> 05:56.079
The locals are thinking terrorism

05:56.080 --> 05:57.650
Not exactly a tier-one target,

05:57.660 --> 06:01.653
but DHS did issue a terror alert
for the border states yesterday.

06:01.660 --> 06:03.696
Just due to the timing
and nature of the attack.

06:03.700 --> 06:06.612
I've never heard of this place. I mean
the militia, okay, that I could see.

06:06.620 --> 06:08.440
Yeah, well, it is close to the border.

06:08.450 --> 06:10.190
It could be traffickers sending a message.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.692
Whoever it is, they gunned down
two cops and blew up a teenage girl.

06:13.700 --> 06:15.748
Until they're stopped,
no one in that town is safe.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.571
We need to be cautious with the locals.
They've lost two of their own,

06:18.580 --> 06:21.367
they're anxious, they're scared,
and they're going to want revenge.

06:21.370 --> 06:23.326
Can you blame them?

07:05.410 --> 07:07.901
"A sad soul can kill you quicker,

07:07.910 --> 07:12.028
"far quicker, than a germ."
John Steinbeck.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.405
Get that over there.

07:20.120 --> 07:21.360
Sheriff Hallum

07:21.370 --> 07:22.530
Jennifer Jareau.

07:22.540 --> 07:28.399
This is the team, Agents Hotchner,
Rossi, Dr. Reid, Prentiss, and Morgan.

07:28.410 --> 07:31.743
-We're really sorry for your loss.
-Thank you. Where do we start?

07:31.750 --> 07:33.115
The first victim, Rod Norris.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.997
Manager of the chemical plant
over in Iblas.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.286
No arrests in 10 years,
since his wife left him.

07:37.290 --> 07:40.782
I can't blame her for leaving him,
but it's a shame she left Jordan behind.

07:40.790 --> 07:44.328
-What can you tell us about Jordan?
-Sweet girl. A bit slow.

07:44.330 --> 07:49.029
-Slow -Not quite. Special Ed and all that stuff.

07:49.040 --> 07:54.398
Takes some talking to to notice it.
I think her mother leaving took its toll.

07:54.410 --> 07:57.322
Sheriff, I'd like to gather your people
back at the office

07:57.330 --> 08:01.653
-so I can brief them all together.
-Sure. But I'm staying here.

08:01.660 --> 08:03.446
Of course. Thank you.

08:06.330 --> 08:08.070
The blast was localized here.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.786
The room's been sealed off.

08:09.790 --> 08:14.193
There's some plastic, duct tape
on the door sills. Windows, too.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.077
Cordite. Gun powder.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.945
They found a dozen canisters, it says.

08:17.950 --> 08:21.659
The concentration of damage puts
those canisters right here by the door.

08:21.660 --> 08:24.788
He seals the kitchen,
blows out the pilot light,

08:24.790 --> 08:29.910
trapping the gas in here,
near the primary charge.

08:29.910 --> 08:33.198
If she was here,
between the charge and the window...

08:33.200 --> 08:37.318
Boom. Rod Norris ends up in the tree,
Jordan ends up in the field.

08:37.330 --> 08:38.740
They didn't care about
the rest of the house, though.

08:38.750 --> 08:40.820
The whole thing's designed
to focus the blast

08:40.830 --> 08:43.492
-on whoever came through that door.
-Yeah. But what was the trigger?

08:45.000 --> 08:48.288
Rod Norris. He was a smoker.

08:48.290 --> 08:51.532
And they knew he would
be coming through this door.

08:51.540 --> 08:53.610
They knew he'd be smoking when he did it.

08:56.660 --> 08:58.901
Hit pattern says
they were fired on full auto.

08:58.910 --> 09:01.947
Tight grouping for it.
Single burst put them both down.

09:01.950 --> 09:04.191
That takes skill,
and some serious training.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.033
Letts lands here, still alive.
Savage falls there, dead.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.826
But I walk past Letts,

09:09.790 --> 09:12.406
and I shoot Lou Savage in the face
when I know he's already dead.

09:12.410 --> 09:14.571
-This was personal.
-They knew each other?

09:14.580 --> 09:16.536
Enough to know Rod Norris
would enter through the back door

09:16.540 --> 09:18.155
-while smoking.
-And that Lou Savage was on duty,

09:18.160 --> 09:19.286
and would respond.

09:19.290 --> 09:20.655
So, what are we talking about here?

09:20.660 --> 09:23.151
This wasn't terrorism,
domestic or otherwise.

09:23.160 --> 09:26.243
Terrorists rarely know their victims,
at least, not personally.

09:26.250 --> 09:28.036
Because they knew Rod Norris was a smoker

09:28.040 --> 09:29.155
who used his back door?

09:29.160 --> 09:31.822
And shot Deputy Savage in the face
at point-blank range.

09:31.830 --> 09:33.695
-They weren't being thorough?
-No.

09:33.700 --> 09:35.577
He walked past Letts, who was alive,

09:35.580 --> 09:38.287
shoots Savage in the face
when he knows he's already dead.

09:38.290 --> 09:40.861
Responders were coming.
That last shot was risky overkill.

09:40.870 --> 09:43.942
Overkill means rage. Rage means
a close personal relationship.

09:43.950 --> 09:47.033
Rod Norris and Lou Savage
were the specific targets of this attack.

09:47.040 --> 09:49.110
Sheriff, can you think of anyone
with a close personal connection

09:49.120 --> 09:50.781
to Rod Norris and Lou Savage?

09:50.790 --> 09:53.361
I didn't think about it,
because of the terror alert...

09:53.370 --> 09:56.578
-Think about what?
-Owen. Owen Savage.

09:57.580 --> 10:00.196
Lou's son was dating Jordan Norris.

10:02.910 --> 10:03.990
SAVAGE RESIDENCE

10:04.000 --> 10:05.570
My deputies didn't find Owen at home.

10:13.750 --> 10:16.901
-How long did you know Lou Savage?
-My whole life.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.696
-And Deputy Savage's wife

10:20.700 --> 10:24.409
-How did she die?
-Drunk driver in '02.

10:24.410 --> 10:27.948
Lou was in Afghanistan.
Owen lived with us until he got back.

10:27.950 --> 10:29.247
Semper fi.

10:30.580 --> 10:32.821
How long was Lou Savage in the Marines?

10:32.830 --> 10:36.322
Twelve years. He was discharged
so he could raise Owen.

10:36.330 --> 10:39.652
-Is that why he resented them

10:39.660 --> 10:42.697
Did Lou blame his wife and son
for ending his career in the Marines?

10:42.700 --> 10:43.997
Lou was a good man.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.867
A good man that doesn't have
a single photo of his dead wife

10:46.870 --> 10:48.406
or only son anywhere in his entire house.

10:48.410 --> 10:50.287
I know this is hard,
and if we had more time

10:50.290 --> 10:53.032
we would be more sensitive, but we don't.

10:55.620 --> 11:00.489
Hope was the drunk driver. I didn't write
it up that way, but it didn't matter.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.367
Her drinking was no secret in town.

11:03.370 --> 11:05.782
-Where's Owen's room?
-Right over there.

11:06.370 --> 11:10.192
Here's your gun safe.
I don't know the combination.

11:10.200 --> 11:13.112
Start with birthdays.
Lou's, Owen's, Hope's.

11:15.290 --> 11:20.239
Hotch. Dress blues in plastic,
no pics of wife and son.

11:22.620 --> 11:25.362
-No luck.
-Try 11-10-75.

11:27.950 --> 11:32.159
-November 10, 1975 -1775. Marine Corps birthday.

11:34.870 --> 11:38.408
You might've just sold me
on that proﬁling of yours.

11:40.790 --> 11:43.406
-That's bad.
-How bad?

11:43.410 --> 11:45.401
Lou was our tactical trainer.

11:45.410 --> 11:48.743
He had a whole collection
of automatic weapons and handguns.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.240
Which he taught Owen to shoot.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.867
-Gun safe is empty.
-That's a surprise.

12:00.790 --> 12:02.826
That's James Dean's Porsche.

12:02.830 --> 12:05.947
No pics of James Dean, though.
That's a bad sign.

12:06.450 --> 12:09.499
Especially when your mother died
in a car accident.

12:09.500 --> 12:12.867
Still haven't found
the Father of the Year award.

12:15.540 --> 12:18.907
-You already checked his computer?
-It's password encrypted.

12:18.910 --> 12:23.074
-Well, smart move if your dad's a cop.
-Assuming he cares enough to snoop.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.401
Hey, Reid. Check yourself.

12:25.410 --> 12:27.571
That sheriff out there
wanted to take your head off.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.117
I think Hotch might have let him.

12:31.950 --> 12:34.783
-All his clothes are black.
-Same here.

12:35.750 --> 12:37.570
Just like his friend Johnny Cash.

12:37.580 --> 12:39.650
So, Owen identifies
with being the misunderstood loner.

12:39.660 --> 12:40.786
You know, I wish all our UnSubs

12:40.790 --> 12:42.940
would just tack their profiles
on their walls like this for us.

12:42.950 --> 12:45.612
It doesn't mean anything. What, you
grew up in Chicago, a high school jock,

12:45.620 --> 12:48.032
and you have pictures of Scottie Pippen

12:48.040 --> 12:49.439
and Michael Jordan all over your walls?

12:49.450 --> 12:52.783
-Trophies everywhere?
-Yeah, but you forgot Walter Payton.

12:52.790 --> 12:55.532
Not to mention the sew ladies of
the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.

12:55.540 --> 12:58.782
Smart money says
you didn't paint your mirrors black.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.781
I guess Owen didn't like what he saw.

13:00.790 --> 13:01.939
Don't try to stop me.
I need to get by.

13:01.950 --> 13:03.076
Reid.

13:03.080 --> 13:04.445
-Let me by. Let me by, Bert!
-I can't. Sarah, I can't.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.613
Don't you try to stop me. Let me by!

13:07.620 --> 13:09.827
-Is it true?
-Sarah, please.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.320
If it's true, you tell me!

13:11.330 --> 13:13.321
-Sarah...
-Did Lou's freak son shoot Byron?

13:13.330 --> 13:15.992
Go home to your kids, Sarah.
Your kids need you at home.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.696
My children need their daddy.

13:18.700 --> 13:20.656
It's Officer Letts' wife.
SARAH: You send them home.

13:20.660 --> 13:22.196
You don't need them.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.907
You know what to do.
You find that little son of a bitch.

13:24.910 --> 13:27.367
You find him, and do what's right.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.747
Why do I get the feeling
she's not going to be

13:29.750 --> 13:32.196
-the only one with that sentiment?
-Stay here and work the room.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.656
Reid and I are going to go
to the high school

13:33.660 --> 13:35.491
and talk to Owen's teachers and friends.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.866
We need to get a profile
and figure out where he's going.

13:37.870 --> 13:39.360
All right.

13:41.620 --> 13:45.943
He's heading out of town.
We found his car out by the Interstate,

13:45.950 --> 13:47.577
right next to victim number five.

13:52.500 --> 13:57.779
I can't use the Texas Rangers here.
I need them working roadblock.

13:57.790 --> 13:59.826
Owen's truck is completely cleaned out.

13:59.830 --> 14:01.991
He didn't want to leave us any clues
where he was headed.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.115
He's a smart kid.

14:03.120 --> 14:06.783
So far every move he's made
has been clever and well-planned.

14:06.790 --> 14:08.075
What about the victim?

14:08.080 --> 14:10.651
Single gunshot wound to the face.
Who is he?

14:10.660 --> 14:14.369
Kyle Borden, 19. Worked the register.
His car is gone.

14:14.370 --> 14:15.860
We already put it out on the wire.

14:15.870 --> 14:18.031
So, Owen stops by here
on his way to the Interstate,

14:18.040 --> 14:21.077
grabs supplies, marches Kyle out back,

14:21.080 --> 14:22.820
kills him, and steals his El Camino.

14:22.830 --> 14:25.867
No evidence Kyle resisted.
Owen didn't have to kill him.

14:25.870 --> 14:28.191
Well, he certainly didn't have to
shoot him in the face.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.690
He wanted Kyle to see it coming.

14:29.700 --> 14:32.362
Kyle was a couple of years
ahead of Owen in school.

14:32.370 --> 14:34.406
It follows he'd know him.

14:34.410 --> 14:35.741
Excuse me.

14:36.950 --> 14:40.078
Owen didn't just know him. Owen hated him.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.115
The question is why?

14:43.660 --> 14:45.696
It's been restocked recently.

14:45.700 --> 14:49.158
According to the invoice,
this last night after closing.

14:49.160 --> 14:50.286
Good.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.991
We have a problem.

14:56.790 --> 15:00.658
He took gallon jugs of milk,
frozen pizzas, cold cuts,

15:01.620 --> 15:03.076
but no water.

15:03.080 --> 15:06.789
You don't take frozen foods
and perishables on a road trip.

15:08.330 --> 15:11.697
-Roadblocks aren't going to work.
-Why is that?

15:11.700 --> 15:14.658
-He's not on the road.
-He's still here. He never left.

15:14.660 --> 15:19.359
Correction. They're still here.
That wasn't Jordan's body we found.

15:19.370 --> 15:22.658
-Who was it?
-Not who. What.

15:22.950 --> 15:25.748
The remains we sent to the ME.
turned out to be three hams

15:25.750 --> 15:29.698
and a dozen bone-in ribeyes
stuffed in Jordan Norris' blue jeans.

15:29.700 --> 15:33.113
So you tell me.
Is she a hostage or accomplice?

15:57.830 --> 15:58.899
Owen?

16:09.370 --> 16:10.530
Owen?

16:20.580 --> 16:22.946
-Hey.
-Owen. You scared me.

16:22.950 --> 16:26.363
-I made you breakfast.
-I woke up and you weren't here.

16:26.370 --> 16:29.749
Yeah, well, I went out. I got you those.
Cut them fresh.

16:31.330 --> 16:32.786
They're beautiful.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.611
How long can we stay here?

16:38.620 --> 16:42.249
Well, old man Stratman doesn't usually
come back until the first.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.992
You know, I figure our dads won't be
looking for us around here by then,

16:45.000 --> 16:46.786
so we can just slip away.

16:46.790 --> 16:50.612
You know, baby,
we can go wherever we want to go.

16:50.620 --> 16:52.656
The money that I saved up,

16:52.660 --> 16:55.538
you know, you and I
just buy a house. Just escape.

16:55.540 --> 16:58.111
If my daddy finds us, he'll kill you.
I know he will.

16:58.120 --> 17:00.532
No, he won't. He will not hurt you again.

17:00.540 --> 17:03.828
No one will. Not while I'm here, okay?

17:03.830 --> 17:07.903
-You promise?
-Yeah. I promise.

17:18.750 --> 17:21.321
As Owen's counselor, what can you
tell us about Jordan and Owen?

17:21.330 --> 17:24.367
Not much. They started dating last year
when Owen moved to Special Ed.

17:24.370 --> 17:26.156
Junior year

17:26.160 --> 17:29.152
Yes, if he'd been
put there for academic reasons.

17:29.160 --> 17:32.118
-What was the problem?
-Bad attitude, lack of effort.

17:32.120 --> 17:35.942
I mean, Owen applied himself
in some classes and did very well,

17:35.950 --> 17:38.282
but it didn't last. Here we are.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.651
The problem wasn't
lack of effort or bad attitude.

17:43.660 --> 17:46.117
The A's in Math and Science
tell us he's a gifted student.

17:46.120 --> 17:47.326
The D's in English and History,

17:47.330 --> 17:48.649
that tells us
that he had difficulty reading.

17:48.660 --> 17:52.744
And the F in Geometry, that indicates
a severe problem with spatial relations.

17:52.750 --> 17:56.072
That's further confirmed
by his atrocious illegible handwriting.

17:56.080 --> 17:59.368
All consistent with a brilliant
but severely learning-disabled student.

17:59.370 --> 18:02.191
Yeah, but his standardized tests
didn't support that kind of intelligence.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.532
But a spatial-relations handicap
affects your hand-eye coordination.

18:04.540 --> 18:08.032
He couldn't fill in an answer bubble
any easier than he could hit a baseball.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.689
Which is why he stayed away from sports.

18:09.700 --> 18:12.032
Sports was a sore spot with his father.

18:12.040 --> 18:14.497
I mean, he joined the wrestling team
his freshman year

18:14.500 --> 18:17.992
just to appease his old man,
but that didn't work out.

18:19.950 --> 18:20.996
Excuse me.

18:25.700 --> 18:27.190
Come on, Mom.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.690
Johnny Cash.

18:36.200 --> 18:39.658
Hope Savage, I know you're trying
to tell me something.

18:43.660 --> 18:44.695
Hope.

18:48.660 --> 18:50.150
Okay.

18:50.160 --> 18:53.072
He was probably the smartest kid
in class and just couldn't prove it.

18:53.750 --> 18:57.572
Being the smartest kid in class
is like being the only kid in class.

18:57.580 --> 18:58.695
He missed all of it.

18:58.700 --> 19:01.112
But schools like this can't meet
the speCIallzed needs of every student.

19:01.120 --> 19:02.690
He gives it everything he's got

19:02.700 --> 19:04.577
over and over and over again,
and continues to fail.

19:04.580 --> 19:06.741
And the whole time, the whole time,
they tell him it's his fault.

19:06.750 --> 19:09.822
-I mean, it makes sense.
-No, it doesn't.

19:09.830 --> 19:11.195
An undiagnosed learning disability

19:11.200 --> 19:12.861
does not add up to this level of violence.

19:12.870 --> 19:15.532
Not without severe emotional abuse.
You know that.

19:16.700 --> 19:20.079
-You got something?
-An .mpg on Owen's computer.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.115
You really need to see this.

19:21.620 --> 19:25.659
Jordan was the gentlest girl in the
world. She could never hurt anybody.

19:25.660 --> 19:28.493
Eileen, can you
tell us about Jordan's father?

19:29.370 --> 19:31.577
He thought she was dumb. And she wasn't.

19:31.580 --> 19:33.286
She'd get the answer if you gave her time,

19:33.290 --> 19:35.360
but he never did.

19:35.370 --> 19:36.780
Did he ever hit her?

19:37.540 --> 19:40.941
She thought she deserved it.
At least, till Owen came along.

19:40.950 --> 19:43.783
-Were they in love?
-Yes, ma'am.

19:43.790 --> 19:46.406
I thought she was going to die
when her dad took her phone away.

19:46.410 --> 19:50.289
She didn't have a computer,
so Owen bought her a PDA for e-mail.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.190
He paid the bill and everything,
and set it up

19:52.200 --> 19:54.691
so that it wouldn't ring
unless it was Owen or me.

19:54.700 --> 19:57.362
-Owen took care of her.
-He tried.

19:58.120 --> 20:02.819
Whenever anyone said anything bad
about her, he'd stick up for her. Always.

20:03.750 --> 20:06.150
What would people say about her?

20:06.750 --> 20:07.785
Um...

20:08.120 --> 20:11.283
When Jordan was a freshman,
there was this senior

20:11.290 --> 20:15.659
who took advantage of her.
He told everyone about it.

20:15.660 --> 20:17.366
That's how she and I became friends.

20:17.370 --> 20:20.828
I thought she needed someone
to look out for her.

20:21.910 --> 20:24.492
I guess I didn't do a very good job.

20:24.500 --> 20:27.822
You're wrong. She's lucky
to have you as a friend, Eileen.

20:27.830 --> 20:29.195
-Yea h?
-Yeah.

20:31.330 --> 20:33.616
We're done for now. Thank you.

20:33.620 --> 20:37.442
Before you go, could you tell us
anything about Kyle Borden?

20:39.120 --> 20:41.691
Kyle was the senior
who took advantage of Jordan

20:41.700 --> 20:43.611
when she was a freshman.

20:44.330 --> 20:45.820
Thank you.

20:48.660 --> 20:50.946
Guys, I'm not so sure I can do this.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.656
It's just us.

20:52.660 --> 20:54.446
It's not like you don't masturbate
at home, right?

20:54.450 --> 20:58.489
No, I can't really do it
while you're watching me, man.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.195
He didn't know he was being filmed.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.612
You want to be on the team,
you gotta do it.

21:02.620 --> 21:04.440
We all did it.

21:04.450 --> 21:06.941
Okay. I'll try. I'll try to do it.

21:06.950 --> 21:08.656
Did Owen tell you about this?

21:08.660 --> 21:11.948
Didn't have to. It was posted
on the school social networking site.

21:11.950 --> 21:13.247
We pulled it down immediately.

21:13.250 --> 21:15.400
Once it's on the Internet,
it's out there forever. Owen knew that.

21:15.410 --> 21:18.038
Not at first.

21:20.700 --> 21:23.248
I mean, he blamed Owen
for the whole thing.

21:23.250 --> 21:25.320
He only joined the team
to get his father's approval.

21:25.330 --> 21:27.537
How were these boys punished?

21:27.540 --> 21:30.247
Owen identified them,
but on film all we had was their voices.

21:30.250 --> 21:32.491
I mean, even if they admitted involvement,

21:32.500 --> 21:34.400
all they had to do was say
that Owen didn't have to do it.

21:34.410 --> 21:37.652
-He didn't know he was being filmed.
-Look, it's his word against theirs.

21:37.660 --> 21:40.743
Parents would get involved,
the school board, lavwers.

21:40.750 --> 21:44.151
I mean, cyber-bullying
is a hot issue right now.

21:44.160 --> 21:47.118
The whole thing
would wind up on 60 Minutes.

21:47.120 --> 21:49.406
-How's that going to help Owen

21:49.410 --> 21:53.073
I told him that dealing with bullies
is part of growing up.

21:53.080 --> 21:54.240
That sounds familiar.

21:54.250 --> 21:56.241
Boys have a way of
sorting these things out for themselves.

21:56.250 --> 21:57.365
Yeah, they sure do.

21:57.370 --> 21:59.531
Right now, Owen's out there
sorting it out with an assault rifle.

21:59.540 --> 22:00.609
Reid.

22:06.870 --> 22:10.328
I apologize. It's just we've heard
those phrases before

22:10.330 --> 22:11.900
when we interview school shooters.

22:11.910 --> 22:15.038
Jordan was the motive for Kyle Borden.
It was revenge.

22:15.040 --> 22:17.281
I need to speak to the boys
who made this video, immediately.

22:17.290 --> 22:19.531
Let me check their class schedules.

22:26.370 --> 22:27.746
What is it?

22:27.750 --> 22:30.366
None of them have shown up for school.

22:36.080 --> 22:37.650
He deleted everything but the one .mpg.

22:37.660 --> 22:40.151
I'm walking Morgan through
retrieving what he put in the trash,

22:40.160 --> 22:41.991
-but I'm not _sure._.. _
-We've got three missmg kids, GarCIa.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.992
-We need access to Owen's e-mail.
-The kid is tech savw, sir,

22:45.000 --> 22:47.321
but fret not. I am tech sawier.
Is that a word?

22:47.330 --> 22:49.491
That sounds like a word.
If it is a word, I am it.

22:49.500 --> 22:50.740
DC time, Garcia.

22:51.790 --> 22:55.829
17 AM.
-DC. "Decaf."

22:55.830 --> 22:56.899
Right.

22:57.580 --> 23:00.538
Two alienated kids, no maternal presence,

23:00.540 --> 23:01.825
dysfunctional relationships

23:01.830 --> 23:04.492
with dominating fathers who withheld love.

23:04.500 --> 23:06.149
They were made for each other.

23:06.160 --> 23:08.401
As lovers, yes. But partners in crime, no.

23:08.410 --> 23:09.695
There's nothing in Jordan's profile

23:09.700 --> 23:13.249
that indicates she's capable of
violence. And certainly not murder.

23:13.250 --> 23:17.289
A new .mpg just posted to the school
social networking site. He...

23:17.290 --> 23:18.939
You need to see this.

23:19.790 --> 23:22.941
-It was a joke, man!
-We didn't mean anything by it!

23:22.950 --> 23:26.113
It was three years ago!
No one even remembers it!

23:27.120 --> 23:28.360
I do.

23:28.750 --> 23:31.036
-No, Owen! Don't! Don't!
-Owen, please, don't!

23:34.870 --> 23:37.748
Garcia, is there any way to trace
the .mpg to the computer that sent it?

23:37.750 --> 23:40.071
It was sent from Jordan's PDA,
but Owen's hacked the SIM card.

23:40.080 --> 23:43.493
He's anonymized it. It stops the phone
from transmitting its current position.

23:43.500 --> 23:45.036
Hackers do it to stop roaming charges.

23:45.040 --> 23:47.361
It's good for one call, and then
the carrier turns the service off.

23:47.370 --> 23:49.497
So even if it's turned on
and he's usmg It,

23:49.500 --> 23:51.195
-we can't track it?
-BIngo.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.906
Have the cell company
leave the service on,

23:52.910 --> 23:56.073
-in case he sends anything else.
-Yes, sir.

23:56.080 --> 23:58.787
Let's bring in Sheriff Hallum and see
if he recognizes the background.

24:06.910 --> 24:09.822
"There's a man going around taking names,

24:09.830 --> 24:13.789
"and he decides
who to free and who to blame.

24:13.790 --> 24:16.156
"Everybody won't be treated all the same."

24:16.160 --> 24:17.536
Johnny Cash.

24:17.540 --> 24:19.940
From that song Owen was playing
when he did this, right?

24:19.950 --> 24:21.861
He's been taking names.

24:21.870 --> 24:24.748
Collecting names.
He's acting out his revenge fantasies.

24:24.750 --> 24:29.369
The family, school and social dynamics
do seem to fit perfectly.

24:30.700 --> 24:34.659
He's not collecting names.
He's collecting injustices.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.491
We're ready to give the profile.

24:45.080 --> 24:47.401
Once you've heard the profile,
you'll understand.

24:47.410 --> 24:48.820
We are wasting time.

24:48.830 --> 24:51.242
Owen is here,
and we should be knocking on doors.

24:51.250 --> 24:52.899
That's not a good idea.
-And why is that?

24:52.910 --> 24:55.447
Because Owen's watching.
He's monitoring the news.

24:55.450 --> 24:58.499
Right now, he thinks
you think he's gone. He feels safe.

24:58.500 --> 25:00.991
If we start knocking on doors,
he's going to know that he's not.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.115
He's gonna feel trapped.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.998
Why the hell should we care
about this little bastard's feelings?

25:05.000 --> 25:07.571
All right, we're here to help you
bring in Owen Savage

25:07.580 --> 25:09.536
with minimum loss of life.

25:09.540 --> 25:11.496
The profile tells you
the best way to do that.

25:11.500 --> 25:12.899
Owen Savage fits the profile

25:12.910 --> 25:15.538
of a type of school shooter
known as an injustice collector.

25:15.540 --> 25:17.576
He's trying to avenge perceived wrongs.

25:17.580 --> 25:19.992
If he's a school shooter,
why hasn't he hit the school yet?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.867
Jordan. Most of these guys
are so angry and hopeless,

25:22.870 --> 25:26.112
they just want to kill as many people
as possible and commit suicide.

25:26.120 --> 25:28.031
But Jordan gives him a reason to live.

25:28.040 --> 25:31.498
Otherwise, he's a textbook case.
His life was one torment after another.

25:31.500 --> 25:33.695
His teachers gave up on him,
his classmates bullied him,

25:33.700 --> 25:35.611
and his father blamed him
while giving him access to guns.

25:35.620 --> 25:38.248
Given these conditions,
you're actually quite fortunate.

25:38.250 --> 25:40.650
It sounds like you're saying
these victims deserved this.

25:40.660 --> 25:44.539
-We're not. Nobody deserves this.
-But you could've prevented it.

25:44.540 --> 25:46.326
Reid, can I talk to you?

25:51.040 --> 25:52.780
It's the truth.
They could have done something.

25:52.790 --> 25:54.280
They work with his father. They knew Owen.

25:54.290 --> 25:57.032
So what?
All adolescents profile like sociopaths.

25:57.040 --> 25:59.031
There's a reason you can't
diagnose them until they're 18.

25:59.040 --> 26:00.359
Yeah, and they could have seen the signs!

26:00.370 --> 26:02.941
Nobody sees the signs, Reid.
You know that.

26:02.950 --> 26:05.908
And making it their fault
is not only unfair, it's dangerous.

26:05.910 --> 26:07.571
I want you to go back to the Savage house,

26:07.580 --> 26:08.695
and I want you to go through Owen's room.

26:08.700 --> 26:10.691
-Morgan's already doing that.
-Yeah, and you're gonna join him.

26:10.700 --> 26:13.578
-Oh, you're punishing me?
-No, I'm using you.

26:13.580 --> 26:17.994
You know this kid better than anybody.
Go find us something we can use.

26:23.700 --> 26:26.362
He was out of line, and I'm sorry.

26:28.370 --> 26:31.248
We want to release the .mpg
from Owen's computer to the media.

26:31.250 --> 26:34.196
He left it because he wants us to know
why he's doing this.

26:37.290 --> 26:39.690
-and buy us some time.
-Time for what?

26:39.700 --> 26:42.282
To figure out a way
to bring him in peacefully.

26:42.290 --> 26:44.110
Jordan's innocent and Owen wants to die,

26:44.120 --> 26:46.111
and if you choose to go knocking on doors,

26:46.120 --> 26:48.361
I think it's gonna get her killed.

26:48.660 --> 26:51.402
After the funerals tomorrow,
I won't have a choice.

26:51.410 --> 26:53.947
Until then, you do what you think is best

26:53.950 --> 26:55.110
to find them and bring him in.

26:55.120 --> 26:57.941
-Thank you.
-If y'all would excuse me.

27:02.200 --> 27:04.111
You know what?

27:04.120 --> 27:08.819
Someday we are going to have
a house of our own just like this one.

27:08.830 --> 27:10.991
Can we live someplace cold?

27:12.250 --> 27:13.365
Why would you want that?

27:13.370 --> 27:17.192
I want to wake up Christmas morning
and see snow.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.781
Wouldn't that be great

27:18.790 --> 27:20.189
Yeah. Here.

27:21.950 --> 27:24.032
-You got to smell it.
-Why?

27:24.040 --> 27:26.941
Why? To see if it's the right kind.
You know, people who know wine

27:26.950 --> 27:30.579
can tell if it's the right flavor
by smelling the cork.

27:32.080 --> 27:34.321
It smells like grapes to me.

27:36.410 --> 27:38.571
Yeah. So, this is nice, huh?

27:38.580 --> 27:41.117
It's not a bad spread
for a couple of kids.

27:45.160 --> 27:48.652
-Owen!
-It's okay. It's okay. Sit back down.

27:48.660 --> 27:51.538
-I'm scared.
-It's okay. All right?

27:51.540 --> 27:53.997
Go on back, sit down.
Stay away from the window.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.571
I'm gonna take care of this, okay?

28:01.910 --> 28:03.866
Who is that?

28:03.870 --> 28:07.499
-Owen -Yes, sir. It's me.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.570
What are you doing out here, boy?

28:12.450 --> 28:13.747
Owen...

28:13.750 --> 28:16.401
-I'm sorry, Mr. Stratman.
-Why?

28:16.410 --> 28:19.117
You weren't supposed to be back
till the first week in May.

28:19.120 --> 28:21.497
This wasn't supposed to happen.

28:22.870 --> 28:24.246
I'm...I'm sorry.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.530
Hey, Jordan?

28:30.620 --> 28:32.941
Jordan, it's okay! They left!

28:38.950 --> 28:41.692
Jordan

28:41.700 --> 28:43.907
I thought it was my dad.

28:43.910 --> 28:46.367
No. No, it was just a few Mexican kids.

28:46.370 --> 28:50.113
They got lost looking for the Interstate.
It's fine. They're gone now.

28:50.120 --> 28:51.690
I thought he was going to kill us.

28:51.700 --> 28:53.941
Hey. Okay? Hey, everything's fine.

28:53.950 --> 28:56.999
All right? They got lost.
They're gone now.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.286
Come here. You all right?

29:08.330 --> 29:10.036
Garcia restored those e-mails.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.747
Yeah, I'm sorting through them right now.

29:22.870 --> 29:26.863
Reid. You know, you're not
the only one who identifies with him.

29:30.160 --> 29:33.402
You said I was a high school jock. I was.

29:34.830 --> 29:38.573
But not at first.
My freshman year, I was 5'3"

29:40.000 --> 29:41.615
I weighed a buck-twenty soaking wet.

29:41.620 --> 29:45.329
So trust me when I tell you,
I got my ass kicked every day.

29:46.330 --> 29:48.537
So, the following summer,
I hit the weights

29:48.540 --> 29:51.828
and I got lucky, I grew six inches.

29:51.830 --> 29:54.116
But it was never about vanity, Reid.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.695
It was about survival.

29:59.910 --> 30:01.650
I was in the library,

30:04.290 --> 30:07.157
and Harper Hillman comes up to me,
and she tells me

30:07.160 --> 30:12.029
that Alexa Isben wants to meet me
behind the field house.

30:12.910 --> 30:14.446
Alexa Isben was, like...

30:15.040 --> 30:17.827
Easily the prettiest girl in school.

30:17.830 --> 30:19.991
So what happened

30:20.000 --> 30:21.319
She was there.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.401
So was the entire football team.

30:26.950 --> 30:31.284
They stripped me naked
and tied me to a goal post.

30:31.290 --> 30:34.191
So many kids were there,
you know, just watching.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.031
Nobody tried to stop them?

30:36.580 --> 30:39.037
I begged them to, but they just...

30:39.700 --> 30:41.281
They just watched.

30:44.200 --> 30:47.249
Then finally they got bored and they left.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.536
It was like midnight
when I finally got home.

30:50.540 --> 30:52.440
And my mom didn't...

30:54.330 --> 30:57.788
Mom was having one of her episodes,
so she didn't even realize I was late.

30:58.250 --> 31:00.115
You never told her what happened?

31:00.120 --> 31:03.612
I never told anybody.
I thought it was one of those things

31:03.620 --> 31:06.498
that I thought if I didn't talk about it,
I'd just forget.

31:06.500 --> 31:09.367
But I remember it like it was yesterday.

31:11.660 --> 31:14.788
Reid, you don't need
an eidetic memory for that.

31:16.160 --> 31:18.116
You know, we forget half
of what they teach us in school.

31:18.120 --> 31:22.329
But when it comes to the torment
and the people who Infllcted It,

31:22.330 --> 31:24.946
we've all got an elephant's memory.

31:27.910 --> 31:30.196
Owen just wants to forget.

31:30.200 --> 31:32.282
I know what that's like.

31:36.330 --> 31:38.400
He's been making a big deal
out of saying goodbye to Jordan

31:38.410 --> 31:42.153
in all of his e-mails,
none of it shorthand. That's odd.

31:44.540 --> 31:47.577
He never got a chance
to say goodbye to his mother.

31:47.580 --> 31:49.741
Abandonment is his biggest fear.
That's why he chose Jordan.

31:49.750 --> 31:51.194
He thinks she'll never leave.

31:51.660 --> 31:54.402
Owen's mother's death left him
with severe issues of abandonment.

31:54.410 --> 31:56.150
If we can get Jordan away from him,
we'll save her,

31:56.160 --> 31:59.402
-and take away his reason to live.
-He'll take his own life.

31:59.410 --> 32:02.197
-It's the only way we can save Jordan.
-How can we get her to leave him?

32:02.200 --> 32:04.532
He's kept Jordan in the dark.
She doesn't know about the murders.

32:04.540 --> 32:06.110
-You want to tell her.
-If we can.

32:06.120 --> 32:07.940
We can get her to turn herself in.

32:07.950 --> 32:11.613
But even if we could talk to her,
the only person she trusts is Owen.

32:11.620 --> 32:12.746
There's one other person.

32:12.750 --> 32:14.445
She might be able
to get a message to Jordan.

32:15.120 --> 32:16.747
Jordan doesn't know what Owen's done.

32:16.750 --> 32:19.071
She has no idea of the danger she's in.

32:19.080 --> 32:21.696
No, Owen loves her.
He would never hurt her.

32:21.700 --> 32:24.282
If the police find them
and there's no way out, he will.

32:24.290 --> 32:25.439
We've seen it before.

32:25.450 --> 32:27.532
Even if he doesn't,
she'll get caught in the crossfire.

32:27.540 --> 32:29.747
We've seen that before, too.

32:30.700 --> 32:34.488
We're trying to save her.
You are the only person she'll listen to.

32:34.500 --> 32:38.618
_ We want to_send a text _
explaining the reality of the Situation.

32:38.620 --> 32:42.613
You want to protect her and be
her friend? This is your last chance.

32:46.540 --> 32:52.615
"Jordan, there are some people here
with me who want to talk to you.

32:52.620 --> 32:56.533
"Listen to what they have to say.
They are with the FBI."

32:57.750 --> 33:01.242
-You're doing the right thing.
-It don't feel right.

33:24.040 --> 33:26.281
Send her the news coverage.

33:26.290 --> 33:28.497
Tell her to look at the pictures.

33:28.500 --> 33:31.242
Tell her we know
Owen didn't tell her what he did.

33:32.200 --> 33:33.497
You liars.

33:35.910 --> 33:39.448
Send the .mpg. Reid, do it.

33:43.450 --> 33:45.031
Tell her,

33:45.040 --> 33:48.157
"When the police come for you,
Owen will kill you and kill himself."

33:48.160 --> 33:50.287
-No, Owen! Don't! Don't!
-Owen, please, don't!

33:59.250 --> 34:01.241
"You lie. Owen loves me."

34:02.200 --> 34:03.440
She's gone. Now what?

34:04.500 --> 34:06.616
We've planted the seed. Now we wait.

34:21.950 --> 34:23.998
She's back.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.786
"You were right. What do I do?"

34:25.790 --> 34:27.155
Ask her where she is.

34:30.200 --> 34:32.327
"If I tell you, you will hurt him."

34:32.330 --> 34:36.152
-She's not going to give it up.
-Ask her if she can get away.

34:38.120 --> 34:39.656
"I can try."

34:52.450 --> 34:53.826
Jordan? Jordan!

34:58.330 --> 34:59.365
She's back.

35:00.700 --> 35:04.079
-"You turned her against me."
-It's not Jordan.

35:07.290 --> 35:10.578
Somebody please tell me
we didn't just get Jordan killed.

35:21.830 --> 35:23.149
It was the right thing to do.

35:23.160 --> 35:26.823
I know. I just...
I really thought we could save her.

35:27.410 --> 35:29.366
-Emily?
-Well, we had no choice...

35:29.370 --> 35:30.530
Emily.

35:34.370 --> 35:35.530
Jordan.

35:36.540 --> 35:40.112
I got to the car while Owen was digging.

35:40.950 --> 35:44.158
And he didn't see me
until he heard me start the truck.

35:44.160 --> 35:47.152
He tried to stop me, but I just...
I kept driving.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.241
We need to know where he is.

35:50.950 --> 35:54.659
-You're going to hurt him.
-We don't want to hurt Owen.

35:54.660 --> 35:57.493
But we think Owen might hurt himself,
or someone else,

35:57.500 --> 36:00.071
if we don't get to him really soon.

36:05.290 --> 36:07.326
He's at Stratman's ranch.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.490
Reid. Reid, a little help.

36:39.950 --> 36:42.191
Hey, Hotch,

36:42.830 --> 36:45.242
-we got a body back there.
-Half-dug grave.

36:45.250 --> 36:46.694
Found a note.

36:47.910 --> 36:50.196
"I'm going to return my mom's necklace."

36:50.200 --> 36:52.862
He may be going home to get it.
We didn't find it, but it could be there.

36:52.870 --> 36:54.155
Sheriff, you go there.

36:54.160 --> 36:55.400
You

37:00.080 --> 37:05.108
I wear this crown of thorns

37:05.750 --> 37:10.198
Upon my liar's chair

37:10.200 --> 37:12.282
Reid, what are you doing?

37:12.790 --> 37:13.905
He's going to force us to kill him.

37:13.910 --> 37:16.697
Don't make me be a part of that.
You don't need me.

37:21.160 --> 37:23.242
Meet me at the station.

37:23.250 --> 37:26.037
Beneath the stains of time

37:26.950 --> 37:31.193
The feelings disappear

37:32.500 --> 37:36.402
YOU are someone else

37:38.080 --> 37:39.866
They think he's going
to his mother's grave.

37:39.870 --> 37:40.905
Isn't he?

37:41.910 --> 37:43.286
He was gone when we got to the ranch.

37:43.290 --> 37:45.110
I want to save his life,
but I need to ask you a question.

37:45.120 --> 37:47.941
This necklace. He gave it to you?

37:47.950 --> 37:50.578
-I left it at the ranch.
-He's coming here.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.447
Call Hotch. Tell him.
And don't let her out of this room.

37:55.450 --> 37:57.748
Everyone I know

37:57.750 --> 38:00.196
Goes away in the end

38:00.200 --> 38:02.407
Something's wrong.

38:03.660 --> 38:06.948
He had a head start. If he was
coming here, he'd be here already.

38:06.950 --> 38:10.113
He said he wanted to say goodbye.
Give her back the necklace.

38:11.290 --> 38:12.609
He wasn't talking about his mother.

38:14.200 --> 38:15.781
Yeah?

38:17.200 --> 38:18.861
Okay. We're on our way.

38:19.330 --> 38:20.445
Reid knew.

38:20.450 --> 38:23.613
I will make you hurt

38:24.910 --> 38:28.368
IfI could start again

38:29.910 --> 38:34.199
A million miles away

38:35.500 --> 38:39.072
I would keep myself

38:40.660 --> 38:45.108
I would find a way

38:47.500 --> 38:49.036
What makes you think he'll come here?

38:49.410 --> 38:51.287
It's what I would do.

38:52.830 --> 38:55.071
Prentiss? Cover me.

38:55.700 --> 38:57.782
-What? Reid!
-Do not shoot.

38:57.790 --> 39:00.748
Reid!
-Owen. I don't have a gun.

39:02.870 --> 39:06.112
My name is Spencer. I'm with the FBI,
and I'm here to help you.

39:06.120 --> 39:07.747
Yeah? I need you to stay back.

39:10.080 --> 39:13.652
I know the only reason
you joined the team was for your father.

39:13.660 --> 39:14.991
I know that he blamed you
for what happened.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.400
-Stay back! Right where you are!
-I also know

39:17.410 --> 39:21.289
the only reason you killed Rod Norris
and Kyle Borden was to protect Jordan.

39:21.700 --> 39:24.248
I know the harder you tried,
the worse it got,

39:24.250 --> 39:26.491
and it felt like everybody
just stood there watching you suffer.

39:26.500 --> 39:30.368
-Not a single person even tried to help.
-They didn't. They didn't.

39:31.830 --> 39:33.695
-What's he doing?
-He's blocking our shot.

39:34.120 --> 39:37.078
I know you want to escape and forget.

39:38.290 --> 39:42.613
Believe me when I say I know...
I know exactly how that feels.

39:43.910 --> 39:46.743
But you know what? You don't have to die.

39:46.750 --> 39:49.116
No. No, I'm already dead.

39:50.950 --> 39:53.532
No. No, you're not dead.

39:53.540 --> 39:58.364
If you die, you're going to leave Jordan
just like your mother left you.

39:58.370 --> 40:00.998
I know you don't want that. Do you?

40:03.660 --> 40:07.494
Okay, you bring her to me. All right?
You bring her outside.

40:07.500 --> 40:08.740
I can't bring her outside, Owen.

40:08.750 --> 40:14.780
But if you put the gun down,
I swear to God I'll take you to her.

40:15.370 --> 40:18.407
I promise nobody will hurt you.

40:18.410 --> 40:21.322
You'll say goodbye to her,
and you'll give her the necklace.

40:22.620 --> 40:25.578
All right

40:26.950 --> 40:28.781
Just put the gun down.

40:29.870 --> 40:31.656
Let's go inside.

41:01.370 --> 41:04.282
Don't move! Don't move!

41:09.200 --> 41:13.489
You good, Reid?
ROSSI: It's all over. It's okay.

42:11.620 --> 42:13.827
"We cross our bridges
when we come to them

42:13.830 --> 42:17.368
"and burn them behind us,
with nothing to show for our progress

42:17.370 --> 42:19.782
"except a memory of the smell of smoke

42:19.790 --> 42:24.329
"and a presumption that once
our eyes watered." Tom Stoppard.

42:30.370 --> 42:34.363
You knowingly jeopardized your life
and the lives of others.

42:36.660 --> 42:40.118
I should fire you.
You're the smartest kid in the room,

42:40.120 --> 42:42.327
but you're not the only one in that room.

42:42.330 --> 42:45.743
You pull something like this again,
you will be. Am I clear?

42:46.450 --> 42:49.533
Yes, sir. It won't happen again.

42:52.330 --> 42:55.242
-Thank you.
-What were you thinking?

42:57.450 --> 42:59.111
I was thinking that that would have been

42:59.120 --> 43:01.657
the second time a kid died in front of me.

43:01.660 --> 43:04.288
You're keeping score, just like Owen.

43:05.620 --> 43:08.032
It was my turn to save one.

43:08.040 --> 43:10.747
-It doesn't work like that.
-It should.

43:13.830 --> 43:18.153
I know it's painful when the person
you identify with is the bad guy.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.900
What does that make me?

43:23.000 --> 43:24.536
Good at the job.

43:32.830 --> 43:34.741
I know it's none of my business,
but when we land,

43:34.750 --> 43:38.197
I think you should go
and catch the rest of that movie.
