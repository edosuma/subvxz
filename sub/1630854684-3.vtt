<i>and it dates back

01:19.814 --> 01:22.283
<i>It started

02:04.692 --> 02:07.328

into Devil's Night</i>

to snatching him!

02:22.610 --> 02:23.711
Man, quit lyin'.

02:23.711 --> 02:24.912

02:25.145 --> 02:25.913
<i>Oh, shut up!</i>

02:26.146 --> 02:27.281
What happened?

02:27.281 --> 02:28.649
We ran a guy up to no good
off the block,

02:28.649 --> 02:30.217
and Meech was the lead dog.

02:30.217 --> 02:31.318
Thank God.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.486
No, we can't afford

02:32.486 --> 02:33.721
to go up in flames.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.189
Don't worry, baby.
Ain't nobody's coming

02:39.560 --> 02:40.728
I'm sorry, baby.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.596
Okay, let's take hands,

03:02.550 --> 03:03.751
Good day yesterday, huh?

03:03.751 --> 03:05.753
Yeah. Heck yeah.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.454
With Denise on board,

03:07.454 --> 03:09.189
we're finally picking up enough rides

03:09.189 --> 03:10.591

03:10.591 --> 03:11.759
A lot of car companies
ain't running

03:11.759 --> 03:13.193
on Devil's Night or Halloween.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.862
so we could probably increase
our prices

03:14.862 --> 03:17.498
and really hit 'em.

03:17.498 --> 03:18.699
A'ight.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.935
But no more refusing rides.

03:20.935 --> 03:23.470
And we damn sure ain't throwing
customers out our cars.

03:23.470 --> 03:24.939
Yo, Terry, come on, let's go!

03:24.939 --> 03:26.540

09:04.645 --> 09:06.280
My cousin
in Cleveland got ganked.

09:06.280 --> 09:09.316
So I may need a re-up
on consignment.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.884
Try back in a few weeks.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.619
In a few weeks?

09:12.619 --> 09:14.121
I don't got no few weeks.
This is a drought.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.656
And?

09:15.656 --> 09:17.224
I'm makin' more
withholding and up-sellin'

09:17.224 --> 09:18.325
than I was floodin'
the streets.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.160
Look, I'm not
tryin' to disrespect

09:20.160 --> 09:21.695
your business savvy.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.830
But I'm coming to you
'cause I'm loyal as fuck,

09:23.830 --> 09:26.600
and you one of the only plugs
I'm fuckin' with.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.268
Don't try to spit
my gospel back at me.

09:28.268 --> 09:29.903
I'm not.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.005
I'm just tellin' you
that I listen, a'ight?

09:32.005 --> 09:34.041
Just let me know
what I gotta do, man.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.275
Straight up.

09:42.616 --> 09:45.619
Remember that loud motherfucker
at the table the other night?

09:45.619 --> 09:47.120
Yeah, told y'all!

09:47.120 --> 09:49.089
I'm the man, motherfuckers!

09:49.089 --> 09:51.591
Man, y'all can suck my dick.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.328
He's a Brightmoor cat named
Travis, and he owes me a grip.

09:54.328 --> 09:56.797
I deliver him,
you gon' break me off?

09:56.797 --> 10:00.033
Maybe. But this is between us.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.369
I want you to return
his ass to me alive.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.737
Done.

10:08.742 --> 10:11.778
Remember, blood
don't make you family.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.714
Loyalty does.

10:13.714 --> 10:16.350
Check out your cuz's story.
Make sure it's real.

No sign of a concussion.

But if she starts to feel
dizzy or nauseous,

10:40.807 --> 10:41.842
get her to a hospital.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.777
You hear that, Nikki?

10:43.777 --> 10:46.713
We need you to be honest
about how you feel, okay, baby?

10:49.182 --> 10:50.917
You sure you okay?

10:50.917 --> 10:52.052
Yeah, I'm fine.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.353
But we're just down a car
comin' up

10:53.353 --> 10:54.688
on one of the biggest nights
of the year.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.656
Someone's messing
with your tires.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.058
The middle pin
in the air valves

10:58.058 --> 11:00.160
have been pulled out,
causing a slow leak.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.862
<i>And the tire to blow out.</i>

11:01.862 --> 11:03.296
Who the hell
would wanna do that?

11:03.296 --> 11:04.698
It's probably some stupid

11:04.698 --> 11:06.299
Devil's Night prank, honestly.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.430
Turns out the dealers
we arrested

11:36.430 --> 11:38.765
at the Sherwood apartments
are not 50 Boyz.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.267
Wait, you talked
to them without me?

11:40.267 --> 11:41.935
Yeah, I didn't have
time to get to you

11:41.935 --> 11:43.203
before the lawyers
scooped 'em up.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.472
Oh, so much for transparency.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.973
Look, I'm sorry.

11:46.973 --> 11:48.809
I-I promise to loop you in
moving forward, okay?

11:48.809 --> 11:51.278
Now, everybody thinks
that Lamar's tits up.

11:51.278 --> 11:55.382
So 12th Street has merged
with 50 Boyz

11:55.382 --> 11:57.751
and are now calling themselves

11:57.751 --> 12:00.821
BMF, Black Mafia Family.

12:00.821 --> 12:03.056
Well, that name's more colorful
than the first two.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.392
I don't give a damn
how they rebrand themselves.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.993
Demetrius Flenory is
still running point,

12:06.993 --> 12:09.096
and I'm gon' take him down
this time for good.

12:09.096 --> 12:12.499
Why do you get such a hard-on
when you talk about Moby Dick?

12:12.732 --> 12:14.868
Because that motherfucker
is responsible

12:14.868 --> 12:16.436
for destroying this community.

12:16.436 --> 12:19.106
So you damn right,
I'm trying to Ahab his ass.

12:19.106 --> 12:23.076
You do realize that Ahab
never caught Moby Dick.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.945
Bullshit, he did so.

12:24.945 --> 12:27.481
I guarantee you he did not.

12:27.481 --> 12:31.518
Hey, Beckwith's on a warpath
about findin' Flenory or Silas

12:31.751 --> 12:32.519
before any more blood is shed.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.287
Ay, G-Q.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.756
Did Ahab ever catch
Moby Dick in the end?

12:36.756 --> 12:37.958
Hell no.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.292
Ain't nobody ever catch
that big-ass fish.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.228
Come on.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.463
Uh, ain't no way I'm trusting
a dude that dresses

12:43.463 --> 12:45.765
like a goddamn plum.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.234

12:49.002 --> 12:51.204
Oh, shit. What up, though?

12:51.204 --> 12:53.406
Shit, I just locked down
a fresh supply from K-9.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.142
Good, good, 'cause you know
these niggas be getting

12:55.142 --> 12:56.877
happy feet
over this damn drought.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.912
Yeah, well, we gotta track down
this dealer named Travis,

12:58.912 --> 13:01.148
or we SOL
on the new consignment.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.150
Nigga, we been graduated
past that shit.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.085
Yeah, but we just took a L
in Cleveland

13:05.085 --> 13:06.553
which set us all the way back, B.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.822
So I need you to help me find
this nigga, man, for real.

13:08.822 --> 13:11.024
Word. O-okay.
Well, what, you got a picture

13:11.024 --> 13:12.225
of this nigga or some shit?

13:12.225 --> 13:13.460
Do I look like a motherfucker
that walk around

13:13.460 --> 13:15.328
with another nigga picture
in my pocket, man?

13:15.328 --> 13:17.030
- How the hell he look?
- I don't know.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.900
I remember the man from
K-9's gambling spot, a'ight?

13:19.900 --> 13:21.334
He has some type
of, like, tattoo

13:21.334 --> 13:22.569
rosary shit on his hand.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.304
But he was from Brightmoor.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.072
And I'ma go back and check out
every other tattoo parlor

13:26.072 --> 13:27.240
he a-been through.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.808
Word.

13:28.808 --> 13:32.245
Yo, Nicole got banged up
in a car accident.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.947
Think somebody fucked
with Terry tires.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.048
Man, get the fuck outta here.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.587
What's up, Nikki? Wake up.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.189
<i>Damn, Nikki, you straight?</i>

13:42.189 --> 13:43.356
What happened to you?

13:43.356 --> 13:45.325
What you laughin' at?

13:45.325 --> 13:48.094
I'm playing sick to stay home
from school a few days.

13:48.094 --> 13:50.830
I should tell Mama.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.065
You will not.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.366
Why you ain't tell me
about this shit?

13:53.366 --> 13:54.968
The last time we seen
each other,

13:54.968 --> 13:55.969
you punched me in the face.
Remember?

13:55.969 --> 13:57.170
Yeah, you deserved it.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.573
Look, can y'all not
do this again, please?

13:59.573 --> 14:01.174
We been arguin'
and fightin' our whole lives,

14:01.174 --> 14:02.409
Nikki, but we family.

14:02.409 --> 14:03.877
And I love y'all.

14:03.877 --> 14:06.379
And I got you and Tee back
no matter what.

14:06.379 --> 14:10.183
Yeah, no doubt,
but I got this covered.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.284
I'm tellin' Mama too.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.485
- Think you're slick?
- No, you not.

14:12.485 --> 14:13.954
You ain't slick.
- I am slick.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.555
- Go to school.
- She believed it.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.994
I double-checked
your insurance plan

14:20.994 --> 14:22.262
after you called.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.530
And y'all don't have
the comprehensive insurance,

14:23.530 --> 14:25.966
so your tires aren't covered
for vandalism.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.268
Yeah, but can't you do
something to fix that, no?

14:28.268 --> 14:30.370
I mean, I could change it
to say deflated tires,

14:30.370 --> 14:31.938
but I'd probably lose my job.

14:31.938 --> 14:35.175
Yeah, come on,
I don't want you to do that.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.377
Yeah. The owner was pissed off

14:37.377 --> 14:39.412
about his brochures.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.281
The big dude with
a scar on his lip?

14:41.281 --> 14:44.317
Name's Cleet.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.386
He's the one that
threatened me at the airport.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.887
He's probably the motherfucker
that sabotaged my--

14:47.887 --> 14:50.123
This is not the hood.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.491
This is a place of business.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.526
You're scaring these customers.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.061
Use your inside voice.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.263
Yeah, don't talk to me
like I'm a kid.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.431
Then stop actin' like one.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.667
Go outside and get some air.
I'll be out in a second.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.142
He look the same
as when he was alive.

15:09.142 --> 15:12.178
No, nigga, you look dead-dead.

15:12.178 --> 15:16.116
But I'ma make you pretty
so your family can keep lyin'.

15:17.651 --> 15:21.254
Damn, nigga!
You coulda said somethin'.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.957
Fuck, you Hercules, nigga?

15:23.957 --> 15:25.425
You all right? You all right?

15:25.425 --> 15:29.229
No, I'm all right!
I mean, well, goddamn.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.197
And stop eatin'
all that candy, nigga.

15:31.197 --> 15:34.534
Fat ass.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.436
<i>Come on, man, I know you
ain't thinkin' about taking</i>

15:36.436 --> 15:38.204
a dead man's Gators, nigga!

15:38.204 --> 15:39.506
He ain't walkin'
no damn place else.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.174
'Cause that nigga is dead!

15:41.174 --> 15:43.677
You can't do that, nigga.
It's a violation, man.

15:43.677 --> 15:45.712
Well, it's...

15:48.982 --> 15:50.283
Let me see those.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.222
<i>I'm sorry for losing
my shit at your job.</i>

15:57.490 --> 15:58.625
It happens.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.460
<i>Just don't let it
happen again.</i>

16:02.062 --> 16:03.129
I love your hair.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.364
<i>It looks nice.</i>

16:04.364 --> 16:06.232
It's better than that baby 'fro
you was rockin',

16:06.232 --> 16:08.401
looking like Isaac
from <i>The Love Boat.</i>

16:08.401 --> 16:12.272
Oh, you tryin'
to play me now?

16:12.272 --> 16:14.341
Oh, what'd you say
this is called again?

16:14.341 --> 16:15.608
Calamari.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.510
It's deep-fried squid.

16:17.510 --> 16:18.611
Try it.

16:18.611 --> 16:21.147
Yeah, I'm--I'm straight.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.282
Terry, how are we
supposed to hang out

16:22.282 --> 16:24.184
if you too scared
to be adventurous?

16:24.184 --> 16:26.086
Try it.

16:31.524 --> 16:35.161
All right.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.364
I don't know what
you got me doin'.

16:42.268 --> 16:44.003
It's not bad.

16:44.003 --> 16:47.607
It taste like chicken
with a hint of shrimp.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.075
You can exist in the hood.

16:49.075 --> 16:50.510
It doesn't mean
your mind has to.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.612
Yeah, but hood rules
demand Cleet pay

16:52.612 --> 16:54.514
for my fuckin' tires.
I know that.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.249
Mm-mm.
You don't wanna step

16:56.249 --> 16:57.450
to a guy like that
without backup.

16:57.450 --> 16:58.451
No backup?

16:58.451 --> 17:00.186
Yo, I-I-I can defend myself.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.421
I don't--help--

17:01.421 --> 17:04.190
All that defiance
and stubbornness,

17:04.190 --> 17:06.760
you must be a Capricorn.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.395
Astrology's kinda my thing.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.196
Yeah, I am a Capricorn.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.264
What else that
tell you about me?

17:11.264 --> 17:12.399
<i>A lot.</i>

17:12.399 --> 17:16.202
It tells me that
you're ambitious...

17:16.202 --> 17:18.138
- <i>Okay.</i>
- ...you're disciplined...

17:18.138 --> 17:19.439
<i>Keep goin'.</i>

17:19.439 --> 17:22.509
And you can be persistent
when you wanna be.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.411
I mean, I guess that's true

17:24.411 --> 17:26.279
'cause I'm still chasing
yo' ass, right?

17:29.282 --> 17:32.285
But are you happy?

17:32.285 --> 17:35.121
I don't really have time
to think about that.

17:35.121 --> 17:38.291
I'm too busy tryin' to ensure
everybody else around me is.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.560
My boss got me working late,
preppin' these fraud claims

17:40.560 --> 17:42.128
we're anticipating.

17:42.128 --> 17:44.063
The Devil's Night fires?

17:44.063 --> 17:45.498
The media acts
like Detroiters

17:45.498 --> 17:47.400
burnin' they own city up.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.602
<i>Half the people lightin' shit
up ain't even from out here.</i>

17:49.602 --> 17:52.539
They live in the 'burbs and got
property they can set on fire

17:52.539 --> 17:53.673
and collect the insurance on.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.275
<i>Damn.</i>

17:55.275 --> 17:59.145
But the media's not gon'
tell you that, which is crazy.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.381
Jerome put this
into my backpack

18:01.381 --> 18:03.817
when I wasn't looking.

18:03.817 --> 18:06.319
He asked to go
trick-or-treating with me.

18:26.172 --> 18:27.474
<i>Zoe?</i>

18:27.474 --> 18:29.275
Come on, you don't hear me
calling you?

18:29.275 --> 18:30.510
The car is running.

18:30.510 --> 18:34.514
Think I just saw Daddy.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.349
No, no.

18:36.349 --> 18:37.851
You're just seein' things.

18:50.663 --> 18:54.601
Ain't heard from you
in a while.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.503
I've been busy.

18:56.503 --> 18:57.670
All good.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.840
Why don't we take a ride
together, catch up?

19:00.840 --> 19:02.408
Won't be long.

19:02.408 --> 19:04.277
Have you back in no time.

19:13.586 --> 19:14.888
Okay, fuck, man!

19:14.888 --> 19:16.523
Where can I find him?

19:16.523 --> 19:18.324
Nigga, he'd kill me
if I told you.

19:19.459 --> 19:23.630
Not if I do it first.

19:23.630 --> 19:25.698
Tell me where Travis is,
or I'ma drive this

19:25.698 --> 19:26.699
<i>in your fuckin' eye!</i>

19:26.699 --> 19:28.434
A'ight, dawg, chill!

19:28.434 --> 19:29.469
I got you!

19:50.456 --> 19:52.325
What up, though?

19:52.325 --> 19:54.661
Look, I might be buggin',
but Zoe said

19:54.661 --> 19:56.396
she seen Lamar today at school.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.731
Impossible.
That nigga dead-dead.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.466
Are you sure?

20:00.466 --> 20:02.201
I know what
I'm talkin' 'bout, Moe.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.304
Listen, I seen it
with my own two eyes.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.306
Stop lettin' Zoe watch
all them damn scary movies.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.274
Now, her imagination's
runnin' wild.

20:08.274 --> 20:09.909
I'll hit you up later
when I'm done.

20:19.319 --> 20:20.954
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Cleet.

20:20.954 --> 20:22.488
Um, unless you have
an appointment--

20:22.488 --> 20:23.790
See, I don't need
no fuckin' appointment!

20:23.790 --> 20:25.692
I need this invoice
right here paid in full now!

20:25.692 --> 20:26.693
'Ey!

20:26.693 --> 20:29.963
You got a fucking problem?

20:29.963 --> 20:31.531
You was the one that fucked
with my tires, right?

20:31.531 --> 20:32.899
Well, then you got
the fucking message,

20:32.899 --> 20:34.334
didn't you?

20:34.334 --> 20:36.402
Don't start nothin',
there won't be nothin'.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.471
Or tires won't be
the only thing gettin' trashed.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.239
Now, get the fuck on
outta my shop!

20:41.608 --> 20:43.276
<i>What's going on?</i>

20:50.717 --> 20:52.885
Yo, what the fuck
are we doin' here?

20:54.787 --> 20:55.955
Welcome

20:55.955 --> 20:58.458
<i>to the murder capital
of the world.</i>

20:58.458 --> 20:59.892
Detroit got so many people
who die

20:59.892 --> 21:04.631
from that shit you puttin'
in the streets,

21:04.631 --> 21:07.734
so they puttin' bodies
in containers like this.

21:07.734 --> 21:09.702
What that
got to do with me?

21:09.702 --> 21:12.739
Kato's in one of these.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.273
Come on, dawg,
you think I'm stupid?

21:14.273 --> 21:15.642
<i>Look, man,
she ain't have no family.</i>

21:15.642 --> 21:18.911
Ain't nobody claim her body.

21:18.911 --> 21:22.382
Though she did have
some family.

21:22.382 --> 21:23.850
Here you go.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.623
You was a daddy.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.792
I would say congratulations,
but that don't seem--

21:34.961 --> 21:36.462
Yo, come on, nigga.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.865
Look.

21:38.865 --> 21:41.367
That Black Mafia Family
bullshit is just that.

21:41.367 --> 21:42.702
It's bullshit.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.470
Family ain't gon' have
no motherfucker kill

21:44.470 --> 21:45.838
they baby mamas
and they unborn.

21:48.741 --> 21:52.445
What the fuck
do you want from me?

21:52.445 --> 21:55.048
Tell Meech you got
a hook-up to a new plug.

21:55.048 --> 21:56.983
Tell him he got
some medical-grade shit.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.051
Feel me?

21:58.051 --> 22:00.987
You get Meech to agree
to the meet,

22:00.987 --> 22:02.822
then I'll do the rest.

22:31.417 --> 22:33.720
- Hey!
- Mama! Mama!

22:37.123 --> 22:38.624
Where's Travis?

22:38.624 --> 22:39.759
He jetted.

22:41.494 --> 22:43.396
But I may know where he is
if you give me a hit.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.970
When's the last time
you had somethin' to eat?

22:50.970 --> 22:53.706
She's fine. Get me right,

22:53.706 --> 22:55.041
and I'll tell you
whatever you wanna know.

22:59.579 --> 23:02.815
I'll fuck you.

23:02.815 --> 23:04.717
I'll suck your dick, whatever.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.753
Okay? Okay?

23:06.753 --> 23:09.555
Okay, baby? Okay?

23:09.555 --> 23:11.124
Just give me what I need.

24:13.619 --> 24:16.789

24:16.789 --> 24:19.592
I just--I'm startin'

24:19.592 --> 24:22.929
Well, I've been more useful
to those with doubts

24:22.929 --> 24:24.497
than those without.

24:24.497 --> 24:26.132
Mm.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.734
But I'm not having doubts
about the Lord.

24:28.734 --> 24:32.605
It's, um--
it's about my marriage.

24:34.006 --> 24:35.908
John and I
have been arguin' a lot.

24:35.908 --> 24:40.112
And, um,

24:40.112 --> 24:42.915
lately, we've been
lacking intimacy.

24:42.915 --> 24:45.952
And I found
some adult magazines

24:45.952 --> 24:47.653
in his music sheets.

24:47.653 --> 24:50.056
Sister, every man has desires.

24:54.060 --> 24:56.596
It's just up to you
to make sure

24:56.596 --> 24:59.498
that you are more desirable
than those women

24:59.498 --> 25:00.867
in them magazines.

25:04.136 --> 25:05.905
Just I-I-I-I tried that, Pastor.

25:05.905 --> 25:08.241
I mean, I-I even bought
a new outfit.

25:08.241 --> 25:11.544
And the Spirit just didn't
move him.

25:11.544 --> 25:13.946
Sister, it's not always
the way you look.

25:13.946 --> 25:16.782
It's your attitude,
your spirit.

25:16.782 --> 25:18.885
You have to find the strength

25:18.885 --> 25:20.987
to humble yourself

25:20.987 --> 25:24.090
to be submissive
to your husband.

25:25.191 --> 25:29.128
I mean, I'm not the kind
that easily submits to no man.

25:29.128 --> 25:32.131
Then I suggest you pray
until it becomes easy for you.

25:32.131 --> 25:35.668
So says the Bible.

25:35.668 --> 25:36.903
Thank you, Pastor.

25:36.903 --> 25:39.906
- God bless you.
- Okay.

Everybody knows it.

25:49.682 --> 25:51.117

25:51.117 --> 25:54.053
My babysitter used

26:34.593 --> 26:35.728
No.

26:35.728 --> 26:37.096
Not until you tell me
where Travis is.

26:39.699 --> 26:40.866
He got a spot on Burt Road
with a white door

26:40.866 --> 26:42.268
behind the school.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.236
His Grand National
will be out front.

26:50.142 --> 26:51.811
Mm.

26:54.246 --> 26:55.848
Yes. Yeah.

26:56.382 --> 26:58.751
Yes, now. Yes.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.622
B, get her outta here.

27:09.128 --> 27:10.930
Oh, yes.

27:27.680 --> 27:30.149
We all got choices, Meechie.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.151
I can live and die with mine.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.853
Can you?

27:44.397 --> 27:46.098
Come on, B, we out.

28:03.282 --> 28:06.318
Brother Flenory,
that last song you just played

28:06.318 --> 28:08.821
sounded like you had the saints
shoutin' and screamin'

28:08.821 --> 28:10.056
up in Heaven.

28:10.056 --> 28:11.157
Thanks, Pastor.

28:11.157 --> 28:14.693
We practice pretty religiously.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.328
Lucille informed me that things

28:16.328 --> 28:18.831
may not be as prosperous
in your marital bed.

28:21.901 --> 28:23.202
Say again?

28:23.202 --> 28:25.204
It's nothing
to be ashamed of, brother.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.206
If you feel you havin' doubts
as a husband,

28:27.206 --> 28:28.808
that's what I'm here for.

28:28.808 --> 28:31.043
To listen and to counsel.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.380
You know, Pastor,
I ain't never hit

28:34.380 --> 28:37.016
a man of the cloth before.

28:37.016 --> 28:39.085
But you say one more word
about my bed,

28:39.085 --> 28:41.821
I'll break yo' narrow ass.

28:41.821 --> 28:43.322
I can respect that, brother,

28:43.322 --> 28:47.493
but remember, pride
often comes before the fall.

28:49.261 --> 28:50.362
You been warned.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.937
And find a new spot
for those worldly magazines.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.882
So what's up?
What's the emergency, Pops?

29:09.882 --> 29:11.283
Guess this wasn't
a Devil's Night prank

29:11.283 --> 29:15.521
after all.

29:15.754 --> 29:16.989
You know who did this.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.230
You back in the drug game?

29:24.230 --> 29:25.865
Er, no, no.
Pops, I swear I'm not.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.099
<i>Then why we bein' targeted?</i>

29:27.099 --> 29:28.434
It--it don't matter.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.169
But I promise I'ma try
to make this right.

29:30.169 --> 29:33.372
You know, with all these cars
down, we lose a day's work.

29:33.372 --> 29:36.442
Plus we losin' money havin'
to replace these damn tires!

29:36.442 --> 29:38.410
<i>I was finally startin'
to get ahead.</i>

29:38.410 --> 29:40.012
Now, I'm three steps back
'cause of you

29:40.012 --> 29:41.413
and this street shit!

29:43.149 --> 29:44.283
I'ma fix this.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.252
We gon' fix this my way,

29:46.252 --> 29:47.887
by working harder
and not cutting corners

29:47.887 --> 29:48.988
and creatin' conflicts.

29:48.988 --> 29:51.357
You gon' learn how
to be a real man

29:51.357 --> 29:54.493
and provide for your family
by making an honest living.

29:58.998 --> 30:00.900
I got a son
in college to support.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.301
Shit, go ahead.
I guess it's your turn

30:02.301 --> 30:03.802
to yell at me too.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.405
I love your father,
and I respect him to death.

30:06.405 --> 30:08.240
<i>But he doesn't understand that
whoever slashed our tires</i>

30:08.240 --> 30:09.942
<i>is gonna keep coming.</i>

30:09.942 --> 30:11.343
So we gotta fight back.

30:17.449 --> 30:19.852
You worked at a GM plant,
so you probably know your way

30:19.852 --> 30:21.053
around a car pretty well.

30:21.053 --> 30:22.955
Better than most men.

30:27.359 --> 30:29.161
Daddy, you carvin'
pumpkins with us?

30:29.161 --> 30:30.329
I can't right now, sweetheart.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.497
I'm goin' to Mabel's
to fix her fan.

30:31.497 --> 30:32.498
I'll be back soon.

30:32.498 --> 30:34.066
What about fixin' our walls?

30:36.001 --> 30:37.336
It's already been two years.

30:39.838 --> 30:40.940
Nicole, go on upstairs.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.541
Give your mother
and I a minute.

30:56.222 --> 30:59.158
How dare you embarrass me
to Pastor Swift?

30:59.158 --> 31:03.195
I needed some advice
about our marriage.

31:03.195 --> 31:05.931
That's not somethin'
you discuss with a stranger.

31:05.931 --> 31:07.866
He's not a stranger.
He's our pastor.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.502
A pastor on his third marriage.

31:10.502 --> 31:12.304
He's a man of God.

31:12.304 --> 31:14.039
Don't disrespect him.

31:14.039 --> 31:16.442
And when am I gon' get
some respect around here?

31:20.579 --> 31:22.114
When you earn it.

31:47.473 --> 31:50.175
Come on, show me
some moves, Charles.

31:50.175 --> 31:52.911
Oh, you're doing
fine yourself.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.414
Don't tell me you play music
and got two left feet.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.249
