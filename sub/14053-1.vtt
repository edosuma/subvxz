WEBVTT

00:10.360 --> 00:14.200
HUMPHREY: This is fantastic, it's absolutely splendid.

00:14.240 --> 00:16.520
-It's Fete Mouri.

00:16.560 --> 00:18.600
Fete Mouri

00:20.520 --> 00:22.920
It's the Voodoo festival of the dead,

00:22.960 --> 00:25.360
when we summon any spirits still trapped on earth

00:25.400 --> 00:27.480
and command them to move on to the afterlife.

00:27.520 --> 00:30.520
Excellent. Then why the cigars?

00:30.560 --> 00:33.440
That's to honour Baron Leve. He's in charge tonight.

00:33.480 --> 00:37.240
He has a skull for a face, wears a black top hat,

00:37.280 --> 00:39.600
drinks hard liquor, smokes cigars

00:39.640 --> 00:41.880
and spends all his time chasing after women.

00:41.920 --> 00:42.920
Oh, he sounds like my dad.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.520
-CATHERINE: Camille! <i>-Maman!</i>

00:57.240 --> 00:58.800
There's a storm brewing.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.280
Good evening, everyone.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.680
Thank you, Andre.

01:04.720 --> 01:06.880
William, how are the barrels?

01:06.920 --> 01:09.880
Two more weeks, sir, then we can start bottling.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.240
She's here!

01:13.280 --> 01:16.720
Andre, coffee and liqueurs when we're done.

01:20.120 --> 01:21.760
Well done, Lucy, you found her.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.440
-Of course, Dad. -Zeta!

01:24.480 --> 01:25.920
Mr Thomson.

01:25.960 --> 01:29.160
Elias, please. Tonight, you're a guest.

01:32.360 --> 01:37.120
Daniel? My, but you've grown into a fine young man.

01:37.160 --> 01:38.320
You know why you're here?

01:38.920 --> 01:39.920
I do.

01:41.120 --> 01:43.440
This shadow over the plantation ends tonight.

01:43.480 --> 01:44.840
One way or another.

01:51.800 --> 01:52.840
All right? Of course.

02:12.840 --> 02:14.400
William, could you turn the lights off?

02:15.080 --> 02:16.120
Sure.

02:23.520 --> 02:29.880
Then I'd like everyone to take the hand of the person to

02:23.520 --> 02:29.880
each side and form a circle.

02:29.920 --> 02:33.640
As long as we're holding hands,

02:29.920 --> 02:33.640
whatever appears,

02:33.680 --> 02:36.880
from whatever realm, will do us no harm.

02:39.960 --> 02:45.160
Spirits of the past, move among us.

02:45.200 --> 02:49.560
Be guided by the light of this world

02:45.200 --> 02:49.560
and visit upon us.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.960
Do not be afeard, spirit.

02:55.600 --> 02:56.600
I can feel a presence.

02:58.880 --> 03:01.000
Bethany

03:03.000 --> 03:06.320
Am I talking to the spirit of Bethany Gilliam?

03:07.480 --> 03:09.440
Make yourself known!

03:11.360 --> 03:14.440
Bethany, is there something you wish to tell us?

03:16.520 --> 03:18.680
Don't break the circle!

03:18.720 --> 03:20.480
Just ask her the question!

03:22.600 --> 03:23.840
-Urgh!

04:16.880 --> 04:18.960
CATHERINE: Here we are.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.520
-For you, Camille. -CAMILLE: <i> Merci!</i>

04:20.560 --> 04:22.200
And for you, Humphrey. Wow! Now that is brilliant!

04:24.440 --> 04:25.760
Uh, what is it?

04:25.800 --> 04:27.480
Yes, <i> Maman,</i> what is it?

04:27.520 --> 04:30.280
I've called it "The Humphrey".

04:30.320 --> 04:33.040
Really

04:33.080 --> 04:34.600
Wha... What's in it?

04:34.640 --> 04:38.000
-Yeah! -Everything. In no

04:34.640 --> 04:38.000
particular order.

04:38.040 --> 04:39.800
Right, well... Now, that's my kind of drink.

04:40.760 --> 04:42.160
Uh, thank you, Catherine.

04:42.200 --> 04:43.360
Er, bottoms up.

04:43.400 --> 04:44.400
Yeah!

04:49.520 --> 04:53.120
But Fidel, in five years, I never did it. Not once!

04:53.160 --> 04:55.880
I know you never noticed, that's how good I was!

04:56.440 --> 04:57.480
Eh?

04:57.880 --> 04:59.160
What...

05:00.480 --> 05:02.840
Oh, you mean this one!

05:02.880 --> 05:04.480
Thanks, man, how's your new job?

05:04.960 --> 05:05.960
Uh-huh.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.600
Yeah.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.600
Wait up the man.

05:11.640 --> 05:14.880
No, it's the office phone, and you're not here

05:11.640 --> 05:14.880
to answer it.

05:14.920 --> 05:16.960
I know. It's my turn now.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.760
Hey. You keep safe, yeah?

05:18.800 --> 05:20.040
We'll speak soon.

05:25.320 --> 05:26.560
Honore Police Station.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.080
CAMILLE: Look at this.

05:42.440 --> 05:47.400
I think it's amazing how you embrace the whole

05:42.440 --> 05:47.400
ghosts and ghouls thing.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.320
All we have in the UK is Halloween.

05:49.360 --> 05:50.680
And what happens at Halloween?

05:50.720 --> 05:52.440
Well, now you mention it, it's mainly just kids

05:52.480 --> 05:54.480
roaming the streets demanding sweets with menaces.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.080
But when I was growing up,

05:57.120 --> 06:00.760
my mum would let us stay up to watch whatever scary film

05:57.120 --> 06:00.760
was on the telly that night.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.360
And that feeling of sitting on the sofa,

06:04.400 --> 06:07.400
wedged in between my brothers, I'd feel so safe.

06:07.440 --> 06:09.680
You felt safe watching your scary film?

06:09.720 --> 06:11.640
Yes, of course. That's why you watch them.

06:11.680 --> 06:14.520
-I don't think I've ever seen one.

06:11.680 --> 06:14.520
-You're kidding me!

06:16.000 --> 06:17.320
We've just had a call.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.720
There's been a murder at the Thomson distillery.

06:51.960 --> 06:54.200
You all right, Dwayne?

06:54.240 --> 06:56.800
It's been a while since I did this on my own.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.840
-Don't worry. You'll be fine.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.880
So, cause of death?

07:00.920 --> 07:02.600
It's the knife in his back, Chief.

07:02.640 --> 07:05.000
And a visual inspection of the body reveals?

07:05.040 --> 07:07.640
Well, judging by the angle the knife entered his back,

07:07.680 --> 07:10.920
the killer was almost certainly standing above

07:07.680 --> 07:10.920
the victim and striking down.

07:10.960 --> 07:13.440
-Boom! -Good. And

07:10.960 --> 07:13.440
the murder weapon?

07:14.640 --> 07:15.680
Looks old.

07:18.200 --> 07:21.120
Ah, I think it came from here, Chief.

07:21.160 --> 07:24.560
Three knives were on display, but one is missing.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.160
You see? We may have lost Fidel to St Lucia,

07:26.200 --> 07:28.120
but we're still very much a team to be reckoned with.

07:29.320 --> 07:31.240
His name is Elias Thomson.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.760
He owns the plantation and the rum distillery here.

07:33.800 --> 07:37.440
And it seems he was killed in the middle of a seance.

07:37.480 --> 07:39.320
-Mmm-hmm.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.680
Well, yes, of course! It's Fete Mouri, isn't it?

07:40.720 --> 07:42.200
When you summon the dead.

07:42.240 --> 07:45.920
But I mean, even so, I mean... Well, you know, erm... Wow!

07:47.520 --> 07:49.440
Right, Dwayne. See what you can get here.

07:49.480 --> 07:51.200
Camille, let's go and talk to the family.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.080
Uh, thank you for waiting.

07:59.120 --> 08:01.480
We just need to get a sense of what happened tonight.

08:01.520 --> 08:04.440
Starting with, uh, who you all are.

08:04.480 --> 08:07.800
I'm Andre Morgan. I run the house.

08:07.840 --> 08:12.000
This is Daniel and this is Lucy.

08:07.840 --> 08:12.000
Elias's children.

08:13.240 --> 08:14.600
I'm sorry for your loss.

08:16.520 --> 08:21.160
I'm William Lee. Mr Thomson's foreman

08:16.520 --> 08:21.160
at the distillery.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.600
ZETA: Zeta Akande. I used to be the children's nanny.

08:24.640 --> 08:26.080
But I led the seance tonight.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.760
Oh, really?

08:27.800 --> 08:29.320
I've always had the gift.

08:30.560 --> 08:32.760
And who attended this, uh, seance?

08:34.000 --> 08:37.120
It was all of us... Apart from Andre.

08:37.160 --> 08:39.120
Yeah, that's right.

08:39.160 --> 08:42.800
ANDRE: <i> Elias asked me</i> <i>to stay behind to</i>

08:39.160 --> 08:42.800
<i>make the coffee.</i>

08:42.840 --> 08:45.200
DANIEL: And then we all went to the parlour.

08:45.240 --> 08:47.440
I was the last in.

08:47.480 --> 08:54.000
DANIEL: <i> We sat at the table</i> <i>in candlelight and</i>

08:47.480 --> 08:54.000
<i>we held hands.</i>

08:54.040 --> 08:57.080
<i>The candle went out</i> <i>and then the bell rang.</i>

08:59.440 --> 09:01.240
The bell on the side table?

09:01.280 --> 09:03.440
The spirits use it to communicate with us.

09:03.480 --> 09:04.560
-DANIEL: Yes.

09:06.320 --> 09:09.760
So if you were all holding each other's hands

09:06.320 --> 09:09.760
the whole time,

09:09.800 --> 09:11.560
no-one could've got up from the table to stab

09:09.800 --> 09:11.560
the victim,

09:11.600 --> 09:12.680
is that what you're saying?

09:14.080 --> 09:17.160
Maybe the killer was already hiding in the room.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.600
Not possible. We were the only people in there.

09:20.640 --> 09:23.840
-It's a small room.

09:20.640 --> 09:23.840
There's nowhere to hide.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.720
The curtains were closed.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.200
Couldn't anyone have been hiding behind them?

09:27.240 --> 09:29.040
No. They were open when we came in.

09:32.960 --> 09:34.320
It's an old house!

09:37.160 --> 09:39.360
No secret panels Hideaways?

09:39.400 --> 09:41.320
No.

09:41.360 --> 09:44.600
So why exactly were you holding a seance?

09:44.640 --> 09:48.800
We were contacting the spirit of a woman who worked here

09:44.640 --> 09:48.800
back in the 1850s,

09:48.840 --> 09:50.680
called Bethany Gilliam.

09:50.720 --> 09:54.720
She was a parlour maid who was having an affair

09:50.720 --> 09:54.720
with the plantation manager.

09:54.760 --> 09:58.320
Then, one night, at Fete Mouri,

09:54.760 --> 09:58.320
they had an argument, he pulled a knife

09:58.360 --> 10:01.920
and killed her.

10:01.960 --> 10:05.600
Ever since, it's said that her ghost haunts the estate.

10:05.640 --> 10:08.080
The workers call her Mama Beth.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.880
And people really do believe in her,

10:08.120 --> 10:09.880
do they?

10:18.280 --> 10:20.400
According to the legend,

10:20.440 --> 10:22.640
you only see her when you're not looking.

10:22.680 --> 10:25.000
She appears as a reflection in the mirror,

10:25.040 --> 10:27.840
or out of the corner of your eye.

10:27.880 --> 10:29.960
But seeing her always brings you bad luck.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.520
Then can I ask why on earth contact her?

10:32.560 --> 10:35.320
Elias hired me to summon her spirit

10:35.360 --> 10:38.440
so I could ask her to move on to the other side.

10:40.400 --> 10:45.120
Right, do any of you know who might have wanted

10:40.400 --> 10:45.120
to harm Mr Thomson?

10:45.160 --> 10:46.520
We all know who killed him.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.240
We do?

10:48.280 --> 10:51.960
The circle wasn't broken. There was no-one else

10:48.280 --> 10:51.960
in the room.

10:52.840 --> 10:56.160
It was her! It was Mama Beth!

11:07.240 --> 11:08.320
So the candle went out,

11:10.160 --> 11:11.520
and then the bell rang...

11:11.560 --> 11:13.640
You know ghosts don't exist.

11:13.680 --> 11:15.840
Yes, of course.

11:15.880 --> 11:18.480
Right...  So if the witnesses

11:15.880 --> 11:18.480
all say the room was empty

11:18.520 --> 11:19.920
when they got in here,

11:19.960 --> 11:22.000
then maybe the killer came in after the seance started.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.960
Only Andre Morgan was outside the room.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Okay. Well, let's see if he could have got in unnoticed.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.680
Hey! What are you doing?

11:33.640 --> 11:34.840
I'm going to try and sneak in.

11:45.960 --> 11:47.680
I'm ready.

11:47.720 --> 11:50.520
HUMPHREY: Okay, I'm going to try and come into

11:47.720 --> 11:50.520
the room now.

11:50.560 --> 11:51.560
Yeah.

11:57.960 --> 11:59.360
I can hear you, you know.

12:01.840 --> 12:04.200
Oh. Now I can see you.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.160
Right, well, I think that proves

12:09.200 --> 12:11.000
that no-one could come in through that door

12:11.040 --> 12:13.520
after the seance had started.

12:13.560 --> 12:16.840
No-one came in. The killer was sitting

12:13.560 --> 12:16.840
at the table.

12:16.880 --> 12:17.920
Oh?

12:20.560 --> 12:22.640
And the killer needed complete darkness to commit the murder.

12:22.680 --> 12:26.320
Which means he or she must have been sitting here,

12:26.360 --> 12:28.920
at the table, to blow the candle out.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.680
CAMILLE: And then they must have got up,

12:30.720 --> 12:33.480
stabbed Elias in the back before sitting down again.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.360
A simple enough explanation, except for one thing.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.200
They were all holding hands.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.560
We should go inside.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.760
Ah, erm, er... Mr Thomson?

13:02.000 --> 13:03.280
Can I ask you something?

13:03.320 --> 13:04.680
Of course.

13:04.720 --> 13:07.400
Uh, only, when I asked about the ghost earlier,

13:07.440 --> 13:10.760
I noticed both Andre and your sister

13:07.440 --> 13:10.760
look at you,

13:10.800 --> 13:13.080
but you didn't say anything.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.200
Was there a reason for that?

13:16.680 --> 13:17.920
I've seen her.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.400
Who?

13:19.440 --> 13:20.480
Mama Beth.

13:24.320 --> 13:27.120
I was 14 at the time and...

13:27.160 --> 13:31.240
<i>I stole the key</i> <i>to the old barrel store,</i>

13:27.160 --> 13:31.240
<i>where the murder took place.</i>

13:31.280 --> 13:33.160
<i>Heard all the stories,</i> <i>of course,</i>

13:33.200 --> 13:37.080
<i>but I guess I just wanted</i> <i>to see it for myself.</i>

13:37.120 --> 13:38.960
<i>But when I went down there,</i>

13:39.000 --> 13:41.640
<i>nothing could have prepared me</i> <i>for what I saw.</i>

13:47.120 --> 13:48.200
It was her.

13:49.840 --> 13:50.960
I know what you must think,

13:51.000 --> 13:53.760
but I swear I saw Mama Beth that night.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.680
Look, I'd quite like to be with my sister.

13:56.720 --> 13:58.120
Yes, yes, of course, yes.

13:58.160 --> 13:59.400
-Thank you. -Thank you.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.360
How interesting.

14:03.880 --> 14:05.520
Okay, Chief.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.920
The scene's secured and the paramedics have removed

14:05.560 --> 14:07.920
the body.

14:07.960 --> 14:11.600
Good. Then tomorrow, I want you to talk to

14:07.960 --> 14:11.600
the workers here.

14:11.640 --> 14:15.240
Who was Elias Thomson

14:15.280 --> 14:18.440
And I want to know everything there is to know about

14:15.280 --> 14:18.440
our prime suspect.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.760
-Mama Beth.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.640
A 150

14:23.680 --> 14:25.520
Our number one suspect is a ghost?

14:25.560 --> 14:28.600
It seems that's what they'd like us to believe.

14:25.560 --> 14:28.600
The question is "Why?"

14:40.080 --> 14:41.640
-Coming!

14:57.400 --> 14:58.800
Good morning, sir.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.120
Good morning, Camille. Sorry.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.520
-That's better.

15:03.560 --> 15:07.360
Now, today's burning question, what are you doing tonight?

15:07.400 --> 15:09.760
-Because I have a surprise for you.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.320
Yes, I know how much you like surprises.

15:11.360 --> 15:14.640
-Ah, erm... -No, you'll like this one,

15:11.360 --> 15:14.640
I promise.

15:14.680 --> 15:17.160
You've got jam on your jacket.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.880
Oh. So I have. Sorry. Do you have a...

15:17.200 --> 15:19.880
Thank you.

15:21.680 --> 15:23.560
Well, okay, then. If it's a surprise.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.680
Excellent! You won't regret it.

15:29.840 --> 15:30.920
But first,

15:32.880 --> 15:34.360
we've got a murder to solve.

16:02.240 --> 16:03.800
There we go.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.000
What's that?

16:05.040 --> 16:06.760
HUMPHREY: That is the ghost of Mama Beth.

16:09.760 --> 16:14.400
Well, Elias Thomson owned a food distribution company

16:09.760 --> 16:14.400
back in the UK.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.440
But once he'd made his fortune, he got bored,

16:14.440 --> 16:17.440
he sold it,

16:17.480 --> 16:20.840
came out here, met his wife and bought the rum distillery.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.440
Both kids were born on the island.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.080
So where's his wife now?

16:24.120 --> 16:28.360
-She died of cancer when Daniel was 14 and Lucy, 15.

16:24.120 --> 16:28.360
-Mmm-hmm.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.840
Daniel went straight from school into

16:28.400 --> 16:30.840
the family business.

16:30.880 --> 16:32.720
He's now in charge of the day-to-day running

16:32.760 --> 16:34.560
and Lucy helps with sales.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.960
And what about William Lee and Andre Morgan?

16:37.000 --> 16:39.360
William's worked on the estate since he was 16,

16:39.400 --> 16:41.320
he's now distillery foreman.

16:41.360 --> 16:43.040
Andre's worked for the family for decades,

16:43.080 --> 16:45.880
he was very close to the victim,

16:43.080 --> 16:45.880
more like friends.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.320
Then wives, girlfriends, lovers?

16:47.360 --> 16:50.080
Andre used to be married, he is now separated.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.800
And William lives on his own.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.120
Hmm.

16:53.160 --> 16:54.960
Oh, and as for Zeta Akande,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.800
she was the children's nanny, but when they were old enough,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.800
she left.

16:57.840 --> 17:00.720
Financial checks show she's missed some

16:57.840 --> 17:00.720
loan repayments.

17:00.760 --> 17:01.800
Motives? None that I can see.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.080
Me neither.

17:05.120 --> 17:07.960
So of all the suspects we do have, one

17:05.120 --> 17:07.960
wasn't in the room,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.400
four were holding hands, and one is a ghost.

17:10.440 --> 17:11.480
Chief?

17:11.520 --> 17:12.680
Ah, Dwayne!

17:12.720 --> 17:14.320
So, tell me, what did you find out?

17:14.360 --> 17:17.240
Okay, so a good majority of the workers at the distillery

17:17.280 --> 17:19.840
-believe that Mama Beth is real.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.280
DWAYNE: Some say they've seen her,

17:19.880 --> 17:22.280
or they know someone who has.

17:22.320 --> 17:25.560
And the thing is, the sightings are all

17:22.320 --> 17:25.560
kind of similar.

17:25.600 --> 17:29.000
-With sightless eyes, beckoning like this...

17:29.040 --> 17:30.760
-That's what they all said. -Brilliant!

17:31.520 --> 17:32.720
Thank you, Chief.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.000
Right, William Lee, the foreman,

17:35.040 --> 17:37.120
doesn't even let people go near the old barrel store

17:37.160 --> 17:38.960
where Mama Beth was murdered.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.640
He keeps it locked up.

17:40.680 --> 17:44.480
He reckons the best way to handle Mama Beth is

17:40.680 --> 17:44.480
to never disturb her.

17:44.520 --> 17:47.640
I think that's why Elias agreed to get

17:44.520 --> 17:47.640
Zeta in, you know.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.360
All the workers seem to trust her.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.280
One thing we didn't get from the family

17:51.320 --> 17:54.440
is that Elias came out of retirement

17:51.320 --> 17:54.440
three weeks ago.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.960
Seems the distillery was losing money.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.120
The first thing he did was to sack Daniel.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.840
-Yep.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.080
That's harsh.

18:03.120 --> 18:06.120
Looks like we have a motive at last.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.920
-Good morning, team. -Ah, good morning, sir.

18:12.240 --> 18:14.840
That you're undermanned since you lost Sergeant Best.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.360
Yes, but we're managing, sir.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.840
Uh, Dwayne has stepped up to the plate, as it were.

18:18.880 --> 18:22.560
I'm sure he has, but Elias Thomson

18:18.880 --> 18:22.560
was a prominent member

18:22.600 --> 18:24.080
of the town council.

18:24.120 --> 18:27.520
This investigation should have a full team assigned to it.

18:27.560 --> 18:29.920
Do you have anyone in mind, sir?

18:31.080 --> 18:32.160
Yes, I do. Me.

18:34.520 --> 18:35.560
You?

18:37.720 --> 18:38.880
Problem?

18:38.920 --> 18:40.000
Oh, er, er... No!

18:40.040 --> 18:43.920
Er... That is very generous, sir, uh,

18:43.960 --> 18:45.360
it's just too much to ask.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.440
So, until I can find a more permanent replacement

18:48.480 --> 18:50.360
for Sergeant Best,

18:50.400 --> 18:53.760
I want you to forget that I am your Commissioner

18:50.400 --> 18:53.760
of Police.

18:57.840 --> 19:00.400
I'm just one of the team now,

19:01.760 --> 19:03.080
if you will have me.

19:03.120 --> 19:06.240
Oh, yes, of course. Yeah, it's, erm... It's great!

19:06.760 --> 19:08.000
Isn't it, sir?

19:08.040 --> 19:09.400
I mean, team?

19:09.440 --> 19:10.680
-Yeah! -Great!

19:12.120 --> 19:13.160
Right.

19:14.960 --> 19:16.360
Where do we start?

19:16.400 --> 19:18.400
Uh, well, actually, sir, Sergeant Bordey and myself

19:18.440 --> 19:20.440
were just off to re-interview the family,

19:20.480 --> 19:23.400
but I would like background checks on all those people

19:20.480 --> 19:23.400
that attended the seance.

19:23.440 --> 19:25.840
Uh, perhaps you and Officer Myers

19:23.440 --> 19:25.840
could work together?

19:25.880 --> 19:27.600
-Excellent! Come on, Camille!

19:27.640 --> 19:29.400
Hey, Chief, but... Chief!

19:29.440 --> 19:30.480
Bye!

19:31.400 --> 19:32.680
What?

19:42.360 --> 19:43.760
You should be waiting.

19:43.800 --> 19:47.520
Why? There's no-one to ask permission from. Not now.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.080
But Dad said he didn't want you running things.

19:49.120 --> 19:51.200
Yeah, well, he's not here anymore, is he?

19:51.240 --> 19:53.000
So who else is going to do it

19:54.080 --> 19:55.760
-Thank you, Andre.

19:57.160 --> 19:59.640
-No, of course.

20:00.880 --> 20:02.000
Good morning, Daniel.

20:02.040 --> 20:04.280
Morning.

20:04.320 --> 20:06.600
I understand that your father came out of retirement?

20:06.640 --> 20:08.120
That's right.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.200
Because the plantation's been losing money since

20:08.160 --> 20:10.200
you took over.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.080
Our profits have maybe taken a dip.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.120
So, yeah, Dad came back.

20:16.160 --> 20:18.720
He thought we should spend our way out

20:16.160 --> 20:18.720
of trouble, you know?

20:18.760 --> 20:20.240
New buildings, new machinery.

20:20.280 --> 20:21.680
That you seem to be cancelling.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.000
I, er... I wanted to stay traditional,

20:25.040 --> 20:28.440
you know, low yield, high quality.

20:25.040 --> 20:28.440
Lucy agreed with me.

20:28.480 --> 20:31.040
Still, it must have been humiliating for you,

20:31.080 --> 20:34.760
having your dad come back, you know, because of

20:31.080 --> 20:34.760
your failing.

20:34.800 --> 20:38.280
And then to go so publicly against your wishes.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.680
It was. But that was the thing about Dad.

20:40.720 --> 20:42.640
He always had to have his own way.

20:42.680 --> 20:44.200
Take the seance last night.

20:44.720 --> 20:46.480
How do you mean?

20:46.520 --> 20:49.320
Well, his plans here call for knocking down

20:46.520 --> 20:49.320
the old barrel store,

20:49.360 --> 20:51.480
you know, where I saw Mama Beth?

20:51.520 --> 20:53.120
Now the workers, they said they'd go on strike

20:53.160 --> 20:55.160
before they ever dared touch it,

20:55.200 --> 20:59.080
but Dad wouldn't take no for an answer, so even though

20:55.200 --> 20:59.080
he thought it was nonsense,

20:59.120 --> 21:02.720
he organised the seance to exorcise Mama Beth.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.720
So he didn't believe the stories?

21:04.760 --> 21:08.200
No. No. He'd just laugh at anyone

21:04.760 --> 21:08.200
who said she was real.

21:08.840 --> 21:11.160
Like you?

21:11.200 --> 21:13.720
But was it more or less humiliating

21:11.200 --> 21:13.720
than your dad coming

21:13.760 --> 21:15.600
out of retirement and sacking you?

21:18.880 --> 21:20.080
I didn't kill him.

21:23.960 --> 21:28.760
I used to patrol most of this area

21:23.960 --> 21:28.760
alone, day and night.

21:28.800 --> 21:34.320
-Just me and the wits and the criminal fraternity.

21:28.800 --> 21:34.320
-Hmm.

21:34.360 --> 21:37.480
That's all very interesting, Commissioner,

21:37.520 --> 21:39.560
but what exactly are we doing here?

21:39.600 --> 21:41.280
Background checks,

21:41.320 --> 21:44.760
because I know that that man over there

21:44.800 --> 21:49.960
is the caretaker of the spiritualist church

21:44.800 --> 21:49.960
where Zeta Akande practises.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.720
Yes, but why did you need me to come along?

21:55.760 --> 21:56.800
Jimmy!

21:59.360 --> 22:00.640
I thought he'd do that.

22:01.720 --> 22:02.720
After him, then! Pssht!

22:05.960 --> 22:07.000
Hey!

22:07.800 --> 22:09.680
Stop! Police!

22:12.320 --> 22:14.920
ANDRE: You'll find most of Elias's papers in here.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.000
Can you tell me a bit more about Mr Thomson?

22:17.040 --> 22:19.560
You seem to have worked for him

22:17.040 --> 22:19.560
longer than anyone else.

22:19.600 --> 22:20.640
Twenty years.

22:22.160 --> 22:23.800
He was a brilliant man.

22:25.960 --> 22:29.160
Oh... Were you aware of his new plans

22:25.960 --> 22:29.160
for the distillery?

22:30.840 --> 22:33.160
Oh, yes. Yes, I hear they were quite radical.

22:34.760 --> 22:37.240
Daniel and Lucy are good kids.

22:37.280 --> 22:39.920
But in this case, I agreed with Elias.

22:39.960 --> 22:42.160
His plans were the right thing for all of us.

22:42.200 --> 22:44.360
CAMILLE: It's mainly documents... Oh...

22:46.280 --> 22:47.400
And this.

22:47.440 --> 22:50.000
Ah. Do you know what this opens?

22:51.040 --> 22:52.880
No, I'm afraid I don't.

22:52.920 --> 22:56.440
Maybe it's from a cashbox or a storeroom?

22:57.440 --> 22:59.400
No, I don't think so,

22:59.440 --> 23:00.480
but we could check the house.

23:00.520 --> 23:02.000
Good.

23:02.040 --> 23:05.120
Because if Elias kept this in his safe,

23:02.040 --> 23:05.120
it has to be important.

23:13.640 --> 23:14.720
CATHERINE: Dwayne?

23:16.520 --> 23:17.840
Are you all right?

23:18.520 --> 23:20.320
I've just run 10 miles.

23:20.360 --> 23:21.760
Are you trying to keep fit?

23:21.800 --> 23:25.040
No, I was chasing an informant.

23:25.080 --> 23:27.120
Oh. Did you catch him?

23:27.160 --> 23:28.800
Eventually.

23:28.840 --> 23:32.960
I think he was Usain Bolt's long-lost cousin,

23:28.840 --> 23:32.960
and cheeky, too.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.880
He stopped twice to wait for me,

23:33.000 --> 23:34.880
you know!

23:36.840 --> 23:37.920
Can I get you something?

23:38.360 --> 23:39.560
Water.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.000
Water

23:41.040 --> 23:42.720
And a rum to take away the taste.

23:51.840 --> 23:54.720
Er, yeah, I'm fine,

23:54.760 --> 23:56.320
just trying to catch my breath.

23:56.360 --> 23:59.840
You see, I was chasing a... A really dangerous criminal.

23:59.880 --> 24:02.440
Hmm, I guessed it must be something like that.

24:02.480 --> 24:04.040
Huh?

24:04.080 --> 24:06.360
-The uniform is a bit of a giveaway.

24:04.080 --> 24:06.360
-Oh!

24:08.760 --> 24:10.520
So, did you catch him?

24:10.560 --> 24:12.760
Huh?

24:12.800 --> 24:14.480
The dangerous criminal.

24:14.520 --> 24:18.840
Oh, yeah, don't worry, you're safe!

24:14.520 --> 24:18.840
He's all locked up now.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.680
You're very brave, going after him alone.

24:22.720 --> 24:25.680
Well, between you and me, I was with the Commissioner,

24:25.720 --> 24:29.640
so I had no choice, I doubt if he could even run

24:25.720 --> 24:29.640
10 yards. And that's not all!

24:29.680 --> 24:33.600
The man's got no common sense, you know.

24:35.160 --> 24:37.840
He belongs behind a desk, not out here

24:35.160 --> 24:37.840
in the real world.

24:37.880 --> 24:41.120
No, sir! Man, he wouldn't last five minutes.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.520
Hmm.

24:46.280 --> 24:48.400
I hope you manage to get your breath back.

24:48.960 --> 24:50.040
So do I!

24:51.560 --> 24:52.760
See you!

24:52.800 --> 24:53.880
Uh? Bye.

24:58.560 --> 24:59.880
I didn't get her name. What the hell is this?

25:07.480 --> 25:08.560
You asked for it.

25:09.440 --> 25:10.760
Well, next time, ignore me.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.040
Ah! Ooh!

25:17.200 --> 25:19.760
There was clearly no love lost between Daniel and his father,

25:19.800 --> 25:21.880
but let's face it, he wouldn't be the first son

25:21.920 --> 25:24.800
humiliated by an overbearing father

25:21.920 --> 25:24.800
to resort to murder.

25:24.840 --> 25:27.560
I believe he hated the way his father treated him,

25:27.600 --> 25:29.760
but enough to kill because of it?

25:29.800 --> 25:31.960
Yet he was the one who wanted us to

25:29.800 --> 25:31.960
believe in the story

25:32.000 --> 25:34.680
of Mama Beth, even insisting that he saw her.

25:34.720 --> 25:35.960
I thought you believed him?

25:37.200 --> 25:38.640
No.

25:38.680 --> 25:40.840
As much as the latent schoolboy

25:38.680 --> 25:40.840
in me wish it were true,

25:40.880 --> 25:42.080
our murderer is very human.

25:42.120 --> 25:43.560
Yeah. Whatever Daniel saw

25:43.600 --> 25:45.040
in that barrel store,

25:45.080 --> 25:48.800
-it most certainly was not a ghost.

25:45.080 --> 25:48.800
-Good to hear.

25:48.840 --> 25:52.360
Ah, Dwayne, did you manage to catch

25:48.840 --> 25:52.360
the Commissioner's informant?

25:52.400 --> 25:55.280
Eventually, and he told me that Zeta

25:52.400 --> 25:55.280
was a very good nanny

25:55.320 --> 25:57.960
to Lucy and Daniel. They adored her.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.160
But then one day, Elias sacked her and refused

25:58.000 --> 26:01.160
to give her a reference.

26:01.200 --> 26:04.120
Why? -He didn't know,

26:01.200 --> 26:04.120
but he said it's the reason

26:04.160 --> 26:06.640
why she ended up becoming a freelance palm reader.

26:06.680 --> 26:08.920
She couldn't get any work as a nanny anymore.

26:08.960 --> 26:11.320
Mmm, interesting. Good work, Dwayne.

26:12.480 --> 26:14.840
Er, where's the Commissioner?

26:14.880 --> 26:17.680
He had an official dinner he couldn't get out of.

26:17.720 --> 26:20.680
It's late... Let's wrap up for the day but

26:17.720 --> 26:20.680
let's keep thinking.

26:20.720 --> 26:23.720
We have five people sat at a table in

26:20.720 --> 26:23.720
an otherwise empty room.

26:23.760 --> 26:25.800
The killer blows the candle out...

26:25.840 --> 26:29.040
And when the lights come back on, Elias Thomson has

26:25.840 --> 26:29.040
a knife in his back

26:29.080 --> 26:30.600
and all the witnesses swore

26:30.640 --> 26:32.320
that they were holding each other's hands

26:30.640 --> 26:32.320
the whole time.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.400
Then just how was it done?

26:37.240 --> 26:41.160
DEEP VOICE: And behold.

26:41.200 --> 26:47.400
Godzilla, destroyer of cities!

26:47.440 --> 26:49.280
CAMILLE: Who are you talking to?

26:49.320 --> 26:52.280
Ow! Oh, hi! No one, erm...

26:52.320 --> 26:55.960
Er, ow! Erm, well, Harry, if you must know.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.160
Right.

26:58.200 --> 27:02.320
I'm here for my surprise.

26:58.200 --> 27:02.320
-Yes, of course, and tonight,

27:02.360 --> 27:04.880
I promise you, you are going to love it,

27:04.920 --> 27:06.240
because tonight, Camille Bordey,

27:06.280 --> 27:09.080
you are going to see your first ever horror film!

27:09.120 --> 27:12.760
-Yeah! -Yes, I saw there was

27:09.120 --> 27:12.760
an old Boris Karloff film

27:12.800 --> 27:15.640
on the telly tonight, so you stay there,

27:18.640 --> 27:21.080
and I'll get popcorn!

27:26.800 --> 27:28.240
Interestingly enough,

27:28.280 --> 27:31.480
this was just after Karloff had made

27:28.280 --> 27:31.480
his first Frankenstein.

27:31.520 --> 27:33.200
-Sorry, yes, of course. Sorry.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.680
Even though it's quite obviously

27:35.160 --> 27:37.680
a rip-off of <i> The Mummy.</i>

27:37.720 --> 27:40.400
-Please! -No. You're right.

27:37.720 --> 27:40.400
Not another peep.

27:52.080 --> 27:53.880
Just keep your eyes on that coffin lid there.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.640
It's coming,

27:57.680 --> 27:59.920
one of the biggest scares in horror history.

28:01.960 --> 28:03.040
Just you wait.

28:04.560 --> 28:05.560
Here it comes.

28:07.800 --> 28:09.360
It's coming.

28:09.400 --> 28:10.440
This is it.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.240
Oh, hold on.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.560
Oh, it's coming.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.160
Oh, no, sorry, I've realised

28:15.600 --> 28:17.160
it's not this bit.

28:21.720 --> 28:23.600
All right, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I know,

28:21.720 --> 28:23.600
I know, I know.

28:23.640 --> 28:26.120
But it's all right, they're just running around for

28:23.640 --> 28:26.120
a bit, you can recover.

28:26.160 --> 28:27.200
Aye? Here we go!

28:38.000 --> 28:39.920
So what did you think?

28:39.960 --> 28:41.360
It was different.

28:41.400 --> 28:45.400
Oh, erm... Well, I know. Next time, you can choose.

28:45.440 --> 28:47.080
Next time?

28:47.120 --> 28:50.560
Absolutely. Maybe we could get some sort

28:47.120 --> 28:50.560
of a film club going.

28:50.600 --> 28:53.200
Well, my choice next time.

28:53.240 --> 28:54.640
-Great. -Good night, sir.

28:54.680 --> 28:55.680
Night-night, Camille.

28:57.880 --> 28:59.640
Yes.

29:01.080 --> 29:02.200
Not England.

29:16.760 --> 29:18.160
SELWYN: So...

29:18.200 --> 29:21.560
If the people in the room were all holding hands

29:21.600 --> 29:25.680
and no-one could have come into the room once the door

29:21.600 --> 29:25.680
had been closed,

29:25.720 --> 29:27.760
there must have been a secret passage.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.000
BOTH: We checked.

29:29.040 --> 29:31.240
Then someone was under the table.

29:31.280 --> 29:33.440
-It's too small. -Too small.

29:33.480 --> 29:37.000
I was just, erm, walking the team

29:33.480 --> 29:37.000
through the case.

29:38.440 --> 29:40.160
You might as well carry on now you're here.

29:40.200 --> 29:41.480
Yes, of course, sir.

29:43.160 --> 29:44.560
So what have I missed?

29:44.600 --> 29:47.360
Well, Chief, I was going through

29:44.600 --> 29:47.360
the victim's phone,

29:47.400 --> 29:49.360
when I noticed a number he kept on calling.

29:49.400 --> 29:53.200
So I rang it and found myself talking

29:49.400 --> 29:53.200
to a private investigator.

29:53.240 --> 29:54.800
Elias hired him

29:54.840 --> 29:57.080
because he suspected one of his workers was

29:54.840 --> 29:57.080
stealing from him.

29:57.120 --> 30:00.600
-The investigator was

29:57.120 --> 30:00.600
still putting together a case.

30:00.640 --> 30:01.960
I got him to e-mail it over.

30:05.120 --> 30:06.360
That's William Lee.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.400
HUMPHREY: Mm. CAMILLE: What's he doing?

30:08.440 --> 30:11.200
All these photos were taken over by the old

30:08.440 --> 30:11.200
barrel store, weren't they?

30:11.240 --> 30:14.480
Which is where he's always telling his workers

30:11.240 --> 30:14.480
they can't go near,

30:14.520 --> 30:15.800
because of the ghost.

30:17.560 --> 30:20.520
-Oh, yes. -Good work, Dwayne.

30:17.560 --> 30:20.520
Er... Both of you.

30:20.560 --> 30:23.040
Um, perhaps you and the Commissioner

30:20.560 --> 30:23.040
could start going through

30:23.080 --> 30:25.280
William Lee's background, and keep going through

30:25.320 --> 30:26.800
Elias Thomson's personal effects.

30:26.840 --> 30:29.120
I want to know what this key opens.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.000
-Come on, Camille. -Yes, Chief.

30:31.640 --> 30:32.640
Sarge.

30:34.240 --> 30:35.400
Commissioner.

30:40.080 --> 30:42.040
What are we looking for?

30:42.080 --> 30:44.360
If William's been stealing, I want to find some evidence

30:42.080 --> 30:44.360
before we confront him.

30:45.360 --> 30:46.440
HUMPHREY: Oh.

30:49.800 --> 30:51.240
CAMILLE: This must lead to the old cellar.

30:51.280 --> 30:54.240
Where Daniel says he saw Mama Beth

30:51.280 --> 30:54.240
all those years ago.

30:54.280 --> 30:55.280
Mm-hm.

30:59.960 --> 31:01.240
Not scared, are you?

31:01.280 --> 31:02.480
Me?

31:04.160 --> 31:05.160
Never.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Camille?

31:39.280 --> 31:40.600
-Woo-ha-ha! -Argh!

31:40.640 --> 31:42.160
Oh, my gosh!

31:42.760 --> 31:43.760
Oh, oh!

31:43.800 --> 31:46.800
Oh, sorry!

31:46.840 --> 31:48.280
Yes, very funny!

31:48.320 --> 31:49.640
I'm sorry!

31:52.320 --> 31:55.480
Can you imagine what it was like for Daniel?

31:55.520 --> 31:59.440
A 14-year-old kid, coming down here on his own.

31:59.480 --> 32:01.880
Just goes to show you how the mind plays tricks

31:59.480 --> 32:01.880
on you, doesn't it?

32:02.360 --> 32:03.440
Yeah.

32:05.880 --> 32:08.360
CAMILLE: Now that's interesting.

32:05.880 --> 32:08.360
HUMPHREY: What is it?

32:09.440 --> 32:10.520
Footprints.

32:19.440 --> 32:20.480
Ah!

32:24.360 --> 32:25.560
Bootleg rum?

32:34.160 --> 32:35.480
You want to talk to me?

32:35.520 --> 32:37.400
Yes, if you wouldn't mind.

32:37.440 --> 32:39.680
I understand you're one of the people

32:37.440 --> 32:39.680
who's seen Mama Beth.

32:41.240 --> 32:44.560
And it's always up by the old barrel store, isn't it?

32:44.600 --> 32:46.720
-No, Mr Lee.

32:46.760 --> 32:50.440
It's you who's mocking us, with your stories of ghosts.

32:46.760 --> 32:50.440
Because that's all they are.

32:52.120 --> 32:54.640
Stories to stop others from going in there.

32:54.680 --> 32:56.840
We found your secret stash of rum.

32:56.880 --> 32:58.960
I don't know what you're talking about.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.440
Elias had a private investigator

32:59.000 --> 33:02.440
watching you.

33:02.480 --> 33:06.120
This is the proof you've been stealing from Elias Thomson

33:06.160 --> 33:09.080
and now Elias Thomson is dead.

33:09.120 --> 33:11.000
This only proves I've been near the building.

33:11.040 --> 33:13.400
A building that's been abandoned. So

33:11.040 --> 33:13.400
what were you doing there?

33:13.440 --> 33:17.520
I'm foreman here. It's my job to check all the buildings.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.960
So tell me, did you happen to notice the 15 boxes of rum

33:20.000 --> 33:21.840
the last time you were checking the store?

33:21.880 --> 33:23.520
I don't know what you're talking about.

33:23.560 --> 33:25.040
And you expect us to believe that?

33:25.080 --> 33:26.800
I don't care what you believe.

33:28.560 --> 33:30.040
You say I've been stealing.

33:30.720 --> 33:32.080
I got two words for you.

33:33.840 --> 33:35.000
Prove it.

33:48.320 --> 33:49.800
Have we made any progress?

33:49.840 --> 33:51.240
DWAYNE: Well, Commissioner,

33:51.280 --> 33:54.440
we have been going through Elias's bank statements.

33:54.480 --> 33:57.240
You know, like the chief asked us to.

33:57.280 --> 34:00.440
And I've just seen that, on the 23rd of last month,

34:00.480 --> 34:03.960
Elias withdrew $10,000 in cash from his personal account.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.120
And he never takes out those sums of money.

34:08.200 --> 34:10.080
Not that I can work out why, though.

34:10.120 --> 34:12.080
-Yes.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.280
-Mm-hm.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.760
We should check his diary.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.120
-But I was just going to... -Ah-ah.

34:20.120 --> 34:21.160
One entry.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.280
19 Rue Cassini.

34:25.080 --> 34:26.520
Good job I found it.

34:29.640 --> 34:31.280
-Thank you. -You're welcome.

34:36.080 --> 34:38.560
I can't help thinking, if William is guilty

34:36.080 --> 34:38.560
of murder,

34:38.600 --> 34:40.120
I don't think he'd be so aggressive to us.

34:40.160 --> 34:41.880
Eh? Hey! I was talking!

34:41.920 --> 34:44.440
I'm sorry, there's usually a gentleman selling DVDs here.

34:44.480 --> 34:47.480
-Here we go. -Oh, you mean for

34:44.480 --> 34:47.480
our film club?

34:47.520 --> 34:51.040
Yes absolutely! The film you want could well be right here.

34:51.080 --> 34:52.720
I don't think so.

34:52.760 --> 34:55.160
Wait, they've got <i>When Harry Met Sally,</i>

34:52.760 --> 34:55.160
that's a good film.

34:55.200 --> 34:57.320
You like <i>Quand Harry Rencontre Sally?</i>

34:57.360 --> 35:01.640
Oh, yes, of course. Billy Crystal. Meg Ryan.

34:57.360 --> 35:01.640
What's not to like?

35:01.680 --> 35:03.920
Fine, we'll watch that. It's a good film, I agree.

35:03.960 --> 35:08.600
But why do they wait 10 years before telling each other how

35:03.960 --> 35:08.600
they feel? It's ridiculous!

35:08.640 --> 35:09.760
Because they're not French?

35:11.040 --> 35:12.960
Inspector, we've got a lead.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.680
-It's an address in town.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.680
19 Rue Cassini.

35:16.720 --> 35:18.480
Don't worry, I'll explain on the way.

35:26.760 --> 35:27.760
Hang on.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.120
The street numbers only go up to 17.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.400
<i>Bonjour.</i>

35:39.760 --> 35:40.920
That way.

35:52.520 --> 35:57.160
-Okay, Chief, there has never been a number 19 Rue Cassini.

35:52.520 --> 35:57.160
-Hang on.

35:57.200 --> 36:00.640
What if it's not a house number?

35:57.200 --> 36:00.640
What if it's something else?

36:00.680 --> 36:02.240
-Like a beach locker.

36:03.000 --> 36:07.480
16, 17, 18, 19.

36:07.520 --> 36:10.560
And I bet you this is what the key in Elias's safe opens.

36:15.240 --> 36:16.400
It's empty.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.760
Wait.

36:23.800 --> 36:25.120
Why would someone like Elias Thomson

36:25.160 --> 36:27.240
need a large amount of cash in the first place?

36:27.280 --> 36:29.400
What if he was being blackmailed?

36:29.440 --> 36:32.840
You know, he goes to the bank, he takes out a lot of cash

36:29.440 --> 36:32.840
and leaves it here.

36:32.880 --> 36:34.760
For the blackmailer to collect later.

36:34.800 --> 36:36.960
Which means there has to be two keys.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.600
Hang on. Hang on. How do you work that out?

36:39.640 --> 36:41.800
Because if this key was in Elias's safe,

36:41.840 --> 36:44.200
then how would the blackmailer get the cash out

36:41.840 --> 36:44.200
after he'd left?

36:44.240 --> 36:45.880
He had a copy!

36:45.920 --> 36:47.920
Which means this one must be the copy.

36:47.960 --> 36:50.120
The blackmailer has the original.

36:50.160 --> 36:53.520
So if you want to know who got the money,

36:50.160 --> 36:53.520
we just need to find out

36:53.560 --> 36:56.680
who got the key copied before they gave it to Elias.

36:56.720 --> 36:59.400
Dwayne, how many key

36:59.440 --> 37:02.120
Only one. But I wouldn't go there if I was you, Chief.

37:02.160 --> 37:05.440
-It's run by Mad Dog Mike

37:02.160 --> 37:05.440
and he hates police.

37:11.040 --> 37:12.040
Oh, no!

37:22.640 --> 37:26.560
Right, let me try on my own first.

37:26.600 --> 37:29.640
Please, Commissioner. I've got less pips.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.160
Just give me two minutes.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.200
If I don't get anywhere, then you can try.

37:34.400 --> 37:35.440
Two minutes.

37:46.880 --> 37:50.760
So we've got someone extorting $10,000

37:46.880 --> 37:50.760
out of Elias.

37:50.800 --> 37:53.680
But who was it

37:53.720 --> 37:56.560
Not that any of that matters, though,

37:53.720 --> 37:56.560
because whoever it was,

37:56.600 --> 37:58.400
we're still no nearer to understanding

37:58.440 --> 38:00.000
how they managed to kill Elias.

38:01.880 --> 38:04.400
Just how did the... Oh, yes.

38:04.440 --> 38:05.920
Just how did the killer get up from the table

38:05.960 --> 38:07.800
-and manage to knife a man in the back

38:07.840 --> 38:10.040
-without the person on either side of the killer...

38:07.840 --> 38:10.040


38:10.080 --> 38:13.160
-Okay.

38:13.200 --> 38:15.320
Sir. It's Andre Morgan at the distillery,

38:15.360 --> 38:16.520
-he says he needs us. -Right.

38:19.120 --> 38:20.800
Do you not care about how we feel?

38:20.840 --> 38:22.440
She needs to be released...

38:25.080 --> 38:27.640
She just turned up. She's trying to get into

38:25.080 --> 38:27.640
the old barrel store.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.840
She said Mama Beth came to her in a dream last night.

38:32.080 --> 38:34.640
Madam! Madam, please!

38:35.400 --> 38:36.440
Calm down.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.480
Come with me.

38:39.520 --> 38:42.840
So tell me, Zeta, all those years ago,

38:42.880 --> 38:45.720
why did Elias fire you without a reference?

38:47.440 --> 38:49.920
I think he was threatened by me.

38:49.960 --> 38:52.200
The children really loved me.

38:52.240 --> 38:53.600
He didn't like that.

38:53.640 --> 38:54.960
Must have made you angry.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.400
Very.

38:56.440 --> 38:57.800
HUMPHREY: This is what I don't get.

38:57.840 --> 39:00.680
If you and he parted on such bad terms,

39:00.720 --> 39:03.440
then why did he hire you after all this time?

39:03.480 --> 39:07.080
If he wanted to convince people round here that

39:03.480 --> 39:07.080
Mama Beth had gone,

39:07.120 --> 39:08.960
he needed me.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.560
They respect my gift.

39:10.600 --> 39:11.880
Then why did you accept?

39:13.040 --> 39:15.640
I'm sure you've looked into my finances.

39:15.680 --> 39:18.160
I'm not in a position to turn any work down.

39:18.200 --> 39:20.080
Okay, Zeta, here's our problem.

39:20.120 --> 39:23.080
A man you admit wronged you in the past

39:20.120 --> 39:23.080
asks you to lead a seance

39:23.120 --> 39:25.160
after all this time,

39:25.200 --> 39:27.400
and by some extraordinary coincidence,

39:27.440 --> 39:29.080
that's the very same day he dies.

39:29.120 --> 39:31.280
He wronged me in the past.

39:31.320 --> 39:34.120
If ever I wished Elias dead, it was then.

39:42.520 --> 39:44.080
What did he say?

39:44.120 --> 39:47.400
He swore at me, then he threw a mug

39:44.120 --> 39:47.400
of coffee at me.

39:50.240 --> 39:51.240
Wh...

40:18.200 --> 40:20.200
His mother and I go back a long way.

40:22.160 --> 40:23.440
-Oh.

40:25.560 --> 40:28.040
Oh, hold on, it's the Commissioner.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.720
-SELWYN: <i> Inspector,</i>

40:30.760 --> 40:32.920
<i>I think we've found</i> <i>who got the key cut.</i>

40:32.960 --> 40:34.880
You have

40:34.920 --> 40:39.400
A locker key was cut five weeks ago by Lucy Thomson,

40:34.920 --> 40:39.400
Elias's daughter.

40:43.560 --> 40:45.600
Why do you want to search my room?

40:45.640 --> 40:48.040
Well, because we've got a witness who says it was

40:45.640 --> 40:48.040
you that copied the key

40:48.080 --> 40:49.800
that opened the locker on Rue Cassini.

40:49.840 --> 40:51.200
I don't know what you're talking about.

40:53.480 --> 40:54.640
That key.

40:56.520 --> 40:57.560
Ah!

40:58.200 --> 40:59.480
Camille, arrest her.

40:59.520 --> 41:00.760
All right!

41:04.600 --> 41:06.360
LUCY: <i> It was a few months ago.</i>

41:06.400 --> 41:09.560
<i>I was looking for some</i> <i>documents in Dad's study</i>

41:06.400 --> 41:09.560
<i>and I found an envelope.</i>

41:09.600 --> 41:12.640
<i>It was an old envelope full</i> <i>of letters from a woman.</i>

41:15.880 --> 41:17.200
A mistress?

41:17.240 --> 41:19.400
While Mum was still alive.

41:19.440 --> 41:20.600
You confronted him?

41:20.640 --> 41:23.280
There'd have been no point.

41:23.320 --> 41:26.440
He'd have just lied and said the letters were fake

41:23.320 --> 41:26.440
or they weren't reciprocated.

41:27.440 --> 41:28.800
I wanted to know for sure.

41:28.840 --> 41:30.960
So you blackmailed him?

41:31.000 --> 41:32.800
It was the only way to know if it was true or not.

41:33.640 --> 41:35.200
If he paid up, it was true.

41:35.240 --> 41:36.320
That's rather devious.

41:37.160 --> 41:38.600
It's like Dad used to say.

41:39.240 --> 41:40.960
"Always win.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.560
"And if you can't win, cheat."

41:43.600 --> 41:45.760
It wasn't ever about the money.

41:45.800 --> 41:47.160
But if your dad's handed over the cash,

41:47.200 --> 41:48.760
how come you've still got the letters?

41:48.800 --> 41:50.400
No need to keep my part of the bargain.

41:50.440 --> 41:51.640
I already had what I wanted,

41:52.440 --> 41:53.720
the truth.

41:55.440 --> 41:59.280
Who was this woman, Joanna, who Elias was having

41:55.440 --> 41:59.280
his affair with?

42:00.520 --> 42:01.920
It was Andre's wife.

42:02.560 --> 42:04.200
Joanna Morgan.

42:04.240 --> 42:08.160
You mean your father had an affair with

42:04.240 --> 42:08.160
his best friend's wife?

42:08.200 --> 42:12.280
Dad's relied on Andre all these years,

42:08.200 --> 42:12.280
taking his advice.

42:12.320 --> 42:14.200
They were thick as thieves.

42:14.240 --> 42:18.120
And all along, Dad knew he had this over his friend

42:14.240 --> 42:18.120
and Andre had no idea.

42:18.160 --> 42:20.160
You sure about that?

42:20.200 --> 42:22.960
Dad wouldn't have paid so much to get those

42:20.200 --> 42:22.960
letters back otherwise.

42:24.240 --> 42:25.680
HUMPHREY: You know what this means, don't you?

42:25.720 --> 42:28.320
Maybe Andre only found out recently about the affair.

42:28.360 --> 42:30.640
Yes, in which case, he would have a sudden

42:28.360 --> 42:30.640
and compelling reason

42:30.680 --> 42:32.240
to want Elias dead.

42:32.280 --> 42:34.280
Not that Andre was actually in the room

42:32.280 --> 42:34.280
when Elias was killed.

42:34.320 --> 42:37.440
But one thing at a time, Camille. One thing at a time.

42:37.480 --> 42:40.080
Ah, Andre, can we have a word?

42:40.120 --> 42:41.480
Of course.

42:41.520 --> 42:43.920
Starting with, can you tell us a bit about your wife?

42:46.960 --> 42:48.560
I'm sorry?

42:48.600 --> 42:50.120
You're separated, we understand?

42:51.720 --> 42:53.400
But why are you asking me this now?

42:57.800 --> 42:59.280
You know, don't you?

43:00.840 --> 43:02.400
About my wife and Elias.

43:06.960 --> 43:08.400
It was 15 years ago.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.760
Joanna had an affair with Elias.

43:12.920 --> 43:15.120
It only lasted a few months.

43:15.160 --> 43:19.200
She'd had affairs before and I always tried

43:15.160 --> 43:19.200
to forgive her.

43:19.240 --> 43:20.920
But this time, it was different.

43:22.120 --> 43:23.440
It was Elias.

43:23.480 --> 43:24.480
What happened?

43:26.320 --> 43:27.760
I told her we were finished.

43:29.480 --> 43:32.080
The next day, she packed her bags and left the island.

43:32.120 --> 43:33.200
Where did she go?

43:33.240 --> 43:34.240
I couldn't care less.

43:36.560 --> 43:38.520
I haven't seen her or heard from her since.

43:41.480 --> 43:43.480
You never confronted Elias about it?

43:45.840 --> 43:47.000
I wanted to.

43:48.440 --> 43:50.360
But I also know what kind of woman she is.

43:52.040 --> 43:54.600
And I knew, in my heart, she used him just like

43:52.040 --> 43:54.600
she used me.

43:55.960 --> 43:57.920
So why should I lose everything because of her?

43:57.960 --> 44:01.080
Hmm

44:02.800 --> 44:04.640
So no, I never confronted him.

44:07.280 --> 44:09.360
HUMPHREY: The million-dollar question, then.

44:09.400 --> 44:11.200
Do we believe Andre?

44:11.240 --> 44:12.840
I don't know, but I believed him

44:12.880 --> 44:14.920
when he said he knew about the affair at the time.

44:14.960 --> 44:18.640
And remember, he was outside the room when Elias

44:14.960 --> 44:18.640
was killed.

44:18.680 --> 44:20.560
So he's not the guy who blew out the candle.

44:22.320 --> 44:25.360
So, once again, we find ourselves

44:25.400 --> 44:28.080
looking at the four people sat at the table,

44:28.120 --> 44:30.200
Daniel Thomson, Lucy Thomson,

44:30.240 --> 44:31.640
Zeta Akande

44:31.680 --> 44:34.080
and finally, William Lee.

44:34.120 --> 44:37.040
But do any of them have a strong enough

44:34.120 --> 44:37.040
motive to actually kill?

44:37.080 --> 44:40.200
You know, I'm starting to think maybe Mama Beth

44:37.080 --> 44:40.200
did it, after all.

44:40.240 --> 44:42.040
Although, seeing as she's a ghost,

44:42.080 --> 44:44.200
she wouldn't have to blow out the candle first, would she?

44:44.720 --> 44:46.720
Joke. Sorry.

44:46.760 --> 44:49.720
Maybe the candle was blown out by someone else, Inspector.

44:49.760 --> 44:52.920
-Yes. -Leaving Mama Beth

44:49.760 --> 44:52.920
clear to commit murder.

44:55.520 --> 44:56.960
Say that again.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.440
What if the candle was blown out

44:57.000 --> 44:59.440
by someone else?

45:00.400 --> 45:02.200
Yes.

45:02.240 --> 45:03.400
But what would that mean?

45:05.120 --> 45:06.520
No!

45:06.560 --> 45:08.080
Wait!

45:08.120 --> 45:11.600
But... Hang on... But, yes, of course!

45:11.640 --> 45:14.280
In for a penny, in for a pound... You...

45:14.320 --> 45:17.800
<i>I was holding Lucy's</i> <i>and Zeta's hand</i>

45:14.320 --> 45:17.800
<i>the whole time it was dark.</i>

45:17.840 --> 45:20.280
LUCY: <i> I know I was holding</i> <i>William and Dad's hands.</i>

45:20.320 --> 45:22.560
DANIEL: <i> I was holding</i> <i>Zeta and Dad's hands.</i>

45:22.600 --> 45:25.480
Come on, come on, come on! That's the million dollar

45:22.600 --> 45:25.480
question! Why?

45:26.440 --> 45:27.480
The candle...

45:28.440 --> 45:29.720
Candle...

45:29.760 --> 45:31.800
<i>"And if you can't win, cheat."</i>

45:33.400 --> 45:35.880
<i>I swear I saw Mama Beth</i> <i>that night.</i>

45:36.560 --> 45:38.440
Yes! <i> Antigonish!</i>

45:38.480 --> 45:41.720
-Bless you. -No, no, you remember

45:38.480 --> 45:41.720
the old poem, <i> Antigonish?</i>

45:41.760 --> 45:43.600
-No! -Don't worry, I'll explain.

45:43.640 --> 45:46.440
Or at least I'll try to explain,

45:43.640 --> 45:46.440
if my theory is correct.

45:46.480 --> 45:50.000
Camille, get everyone at the house.

45:46.480 --> 45:50.000
Dwayne, follow me.

45:51.440 --> 45:52.640
And bring a big hammer.

46:18.800 --> 46:20.200
If you would, please, Dwayne.

46:22.280 --> 46:24.640
X marks the spot.

46:25.920 --> 46:27.120
Stand back, Chief.

46:40.760 --> 46:42.080
Thank you all for coming.

46:42.120 --> 46:43.600
But why do you want us?

46:43.640 --> 46:45.800
Uh, because I'm going to tell you

46:43.640 --> 46:45.800
who killed your father.

46:47.920 --> 46:51.320
You see, the key to this case

46:51.360 --> 46:56.040
was the fact that the murder had to be committed by

46:51.360 --> 46:56.040
someone in that room.

46:56.080 --> 47:00.120
So let's consider the four people who

46:56.080 --> 47:00.120
were sitting with Elias

47:00.160 --> 47:01.440
when he was killed.

47:01.480 --> 47:04.320
Because, with your father dead,

47:01.480 --> 47:04.320
you, Daniel,

47:04.360 --> 47:07.160
finally get to run this place how you want to.

47:07.200 --> 47:09.720
As for you, William,

47:09.760 --> 47:13.200
can we believe anything you say,

47:09.760 --> 47:13.200
now we know you're a thief?

47:14.400 --> 47:15.880
And Lucy.

47:15.920 --> 47:18.680
You were already blackmailing your own father,

47:18.720 --> 47:20.440
but are you capable of murder?

47:21.120 --> 47:22.880
And Zeta,

47:22.920 --> 47:26.560
-Elias ended your career as a nanny.

47:22.920 --> 47:26.560
-But that was in the past!

47:26.600 --> 47:30.960
Yes, it was, and I'm sure that your gift will already

47:26.600 --> 47:30.960
have told you this,

47:31.000 --> 47:34.680
but, er... We have eliminated you

47:31.000 --> 47:34.680
from our enquiries.

47:34.720 --> 47:36.840
You didn't murder Elias Thomson.

47:44.320 --> 47:50.640
Which means it must have been one of you three who blew

47:44.320 --> 47:50.640
the candle out.

47:50.680 --> 47:53.280
And then committed murder in the darkness,

47:53.320 --> 47:54.880
before sitting back down again.

47:54.920 --> 47:58.280
All without the person on either side of you

47:58.320 --> 47:59.680
knowing you'd ever got up and come back.

47:59.720 --> 48:01.760
But that's impossible, isn't it?

48:01.800 --> 48:04.800
The first question we need to answer,

48:01.800 --> 48:04.800
the question that gives us

48:04.840 --> 48:09.720
our first clue to the identity of our murderer, has to be...

48:09.760 --> 48:11.040
Who hated him most?

48:13.840 --> 48:14.920
Yes.

48:16.040 --> 48:18.800
But also, who blew out the candle?

48:18.840 --> 48:20.240
-The killer. -It wasn't the killer...

48:22.040 --> 48:23.120
Sir.

48:25.440 --> 48:30.680
See, I believe that our murderer

48:25.440 --> 48:30.680
had an accomplice.

48:30.720 --> 48:32.400
Someone we'd never even looked at.

48:35.560 --> 48:36.680
The victim.

48:38.840 --> 48:42.440
It was Elias himself who blew out the candle.

48:42.480 --> 48:47.400
<i>While you were</i> <i>all looking at Zeta,</i>

48:42.480 --> 48:47.400
<i>Elias seized his moment.</i>

48:47.440 --> 48:48.920
ZETA: <i> Make yourself known.</i>

48:50.640 --> 48:51.960
But why would he do that?

48:55.480 --> 48:58.040
Have you ever heard of <i> Antigonish?</i>

48:58.080 --> 49:01.720
"Yesterday, upon the stair, I met a man who wasn't there.

49:01.760 --> 49:05.920
"He wasn't there again today. I wish, I wish he'd go away."

49:01.760 --> 49:05.920
No?

49:05.960 --> 49:07.920
And what has that got to do with this?

49:07.960 --> 49:12.240
Because Elias was killed by the man

49:07.960 --> 49:12.240
who wasn't there.

49:13.680 --> 49:15.040
You see the killer was

49:17.640 --> 49:18.680
Andre Morgan.

49:24.800 --> 49:26.920
-But Andre wasn't

49:24.800 --> 49:26.920
even in the room.

49:26.960 --> 49:29.760
Yes, I know. And that's how clever he was.

49:29.800 --> 49:32.120
And there was no other way into the room, either.

49:29.800 --> 49:32.120
Or so we thought.

49:34.920 --> 49:37.920
<i>Not possible. We were</i> <i>the only people in there.</i>

49:37.960 --> 49:40.480
HUMPHREY: <i> The window</i> <i>was locked from the inside</i>

49:40.520 --> 49:43.400
<i>and there was no way through</i> <i>the door without being heard.</i>

49:43.440 --> 49:48.600
Until you understand that Andre and Elias

49:43.440 --> 49:48.600
weren't just good friends.

49:48.640 --> 49:51.000
You were in on this together.

49:51.040 --> 49:54.960
<i>Dad's relied on Andre</i> <i>all these years.</i>

49:51.040 --> 49:54.960
<i>Taking his advice.</i>

49:55.000 --> 49:56.400
<i>They were thick as thieves.</i> Whose idea was it?

49:57.880 --> 49:59.800
It doesn't much matter.

49:59.840 --> 50:02.920
You see, the question remains,

50:02.960 --> 50:05.560
why would a man organise a seance

50:05.600 --> 50:07.680
to summon up a ghost he didn't believe in?

50:07.720 --> 50:10.880
It wasn't about him. It was about his workers.

50:10.920 --> 50:13.040
He wanted to tell them that Mama Beth had moved on,

50:13.080 --> 50:15.600
so they'd agree to tear down the old barrel store.

50:15.640 --> 50:18.360
CAMILLE: Yes, but Elias was devious.

50:18.400 --> 50:22.880
So how would a devious man make it look like Mama Beth

50:18.400 --> 50:22.880
had moved on?

50:22.920 --> 50:25.840
You... You'd hide someone in the room and get them

50:22.920 --> 50:25.840
to ring the bell.

50:25.880 --> 50:27.320
Exactly! Exactly!

50:28.360 --> 50:29.960
You convinced Elias that you

50:30.000 --> 50:33.160
and he could play a trick on the others

50:30.000 --> 50:33.160
that night, didn't you?

50:33.200 --> 50:37.720
And in the process, you thought you were carrying

50:33.200 --> 50:37.720
out the perfect murder!

50:37.760 --> 50:41.960
After all, who'd suspect that the killer's accomplice

50:37.760 --> 50:41.960
was the victim himself?

50:45.120 --> 50:48.280
CAMILLE: <i> So it was Elias</i> <i>who made sure he had</i>

50:45.120 --> 50:48.280
<i>a brief chat with Zeta</i>

50:48.320 --> 50:50.320
<i>when she arrived,</i> <i>which gave you</i>

50:48.320 --> 50:50.320
<i>just long enough</i>

50:50.360 --> 50:52.600
<i>to get around</i> <i>and into the room,</i>

50:52.640 --> 50:55.120
<i>making sure you locked</i> <i>the window from the inside.</i>

50:55.160 --> 50:57.720
HUMPHREY: <i> And even though</i> <i>the opened curtain would</i>

50:55.160 --> 50:57.720
<i>barely hide you,</i>

50:57.760 --> 51:00.720
<i>only Elias himself</i> <i>would have seen you</i>

50:57.760 --> 51:00.720
<i>in those first few seconds</i>

51:00.760 --> 51:02.800
<i>and he wasn't telling.</i>

51:02.840 --> 51:06.720
CAMILLE: <i> So, when Elias</i> <i>blew the candle out,</i>

51:02.840 --> 51:06.720
<i>he expected Andre to slip out</i>

51:06.760 --> 51:09.680
<i>in the darkness and just ring</i> <i>the bell, to make it look like</i>

51:09.720 --> 51:13.400
<i>Mama Beth was telling the room</i> <i>she was happy to move on</i>

51:09.720 --> 51:13.400
<i>to the other side.</i>

51:13.440 --> 51:16.200
HUMPHREY: <i> But you had</i> <i>a different plan altogether,</i>

51:13.440 --> 51:16.200
<i>didn't you?</i>

51:16.240 --> 51:19.320
<i>Because the only person</i> <i>who'd be moving to</i>

51:16.240 --> 51:19.320
<i>the other side that night</i>

51:19.360 --> 51:21.040
<i>would be Elias!</i>

51:21.080 --> 51:23.800
CAMILLE: <i> And who</i> <i>would actually notice,</i>

51:21.080 --> 51:23.800
<i>once Elias was dead,</i>

51:23.840 --> 51:27.720
<i>if Andre entered through</i> <i>the door, or just seemed</i>

51:23.840 --> 51:27.720
<i>to appear as it opened?</i>

51:30.200 --> 51:34.120
But why would I kill him? He was my friend!

51:34.160 --> 51:36.720
A friend who once had an affair with your wife.

51:38.480 --> 51:40.480
But, but I knew about all that years ago!

51:40.520 --> 51:42.360
Yes, you did, so why kill him now?

51:44.680 --> 51:47.320
Perhaps it's easier if... If I show you.

51:47.360 --> 51:49.720
Uh, please, come... Come with me.

51:58.160 --> 52:00.000
Please. Come through.

52:12.040 --> 52:13.360
You know, it occurred to me,

52:15.200 --> 52:17.280
that we only ever had Andre's word

52:17.320 --> 52:19.320
that his wife left him all those years ago.

52:19.360 --> 52:21.360
But she did.

52:21.400 --> 52:24.680
After her affair with Elias, she left the island.

52:24.720 --> 52:26.000
But how could she, Andre?

52:27.120 --> 52:28.120
She was dead by then.

52:29.720 --> 52:32.240
And that's because you murdered her,

52:29.720 --> 52:32.240
didn't you?

52:34.320 --> 52:37.120
You see, we checked with immigration

52:34.320 --> 52:37.120
on the way over

52:37.160 --> 52:39.800
and they don't have any record of her leaving the island

52:39.840 --> 52:41.480
the year she left you.

52:41.520 --> 52:42.960
Then they must be mistaken.

52:44.240 --> 52:46.120
It... It was a long time ago.

52:46.160 --> 52:47.320
You have to believe me!

52:48.400 --> 52:50.840
I didn't kill her!

52:50.880 --> 52:54.040
All this is just conjecture, you can't prove anything.

52:54.080 --> 52:55.920
Prove it

52:55.960 --> 52:57.720
I can do a little bit better than that,

52:55.960 --> 52:57.720
Andre.

52:58.480 --> 52:59.560
Daniel.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
You're 29 years old, aren't you?

53:03.040 --> 53:04.920
And you saw the ghost of Mama Beth

53:03.040 --> 53:04.920
in this very room

53:04.960 --> 53:06.960
when you were 14, right?

53:07.000 --> 53:08.360
That's right.

53:08.400 --> 53:13.000
Exactly 15 years ago, which, by an amazing coincidence,

53:13.040 --> 53:18.120
is the exact same number of years ago that Joanna

53:13.040 --> 53:18.120
apparently left Andre.

53:19.160 --> 53:20.880
For 15 years, Daniel,

53:20.920 --> 53:23.040
you've been saying that you saw the ghost

53:20.920 --> 53:23.040
of Mama Beth.

53:24.120 --> 53:25.520
But I don't think you saw a ghost.

53:26.680 --> 53:28.360
I think what you actually saw

53:30.560 --> 53:32.680
was the body of Joanna Morgan,

53:34.560 --> 53:38.640
waiting to be hidden by her killer.

53:49.360 --> 53:50.880
It was the body of Andre's wife.

53:53.520 --> 53:55.320
<i>The adulterous wife</i> <i>he'd just killed</i>

53:55.360 --> 53:58.120
<i>when he found out</i> <i>that she was having</i>

53:55.360 --> 53:58.120
<i>an affair with his boss,</i>

53:58.160 --> 54:01.520
<i>and then he hid her body</i> <i>in the one place</i>

54:01.560 --> 54:04.280
<i>he reckoned that no-one</i> <i>would ever think to look.</i>

54:04.320 --> 54:08.760
<i>The cellar</i> <i>of a haunted building</i>

54:04.320 --> 54:08.760
<i>no-one ever went into.</i>

54:10.360 --> 54:12.160
CAMILLE: All went well for you

54:12.200 --> 54:15.640
until Elias came up with his plans

54:12.200 --> 54:15.640
to modernise the plantation.

54:15.680 --> 54:19.440
<i>His plans here call for</i> <i>knocking down the old barrel</i>

54:15.680 --> 54:19.440
<i>store, where I saw Mama Beth.</i>

54:19.480 --> 54:22.200
So you knew if they pulled down

54:19.480 --> 54:22.200
this building,

54:22.240 --> 54:24.000
well, her body would be discovered.

54:24.040 --> 54:28.280
But if you could kill Elias first, Daniel and Lucy

54:24.040 --> 54:28.280
would take over

54:28.320 --> 54:31.640
and we all know they'd never demolish this place.

54:31.680 --> 54:33.680
Your wife's murder could stay secret.

54:33.720 --> 54:37.480
Which is the real reason why you stayed here

54:33.720 --> 54:37.480
working for Elias,

54:37.520 --> 54:38.920
even after the affair.

54:38.960 --> 54:42.560
You had to stay here to guard your secret.

54:45.040 --> 54:48.000
The last 15 years must have been absolute hell for you.

54:51.240 --> 54:52.240
Dwayne?

54:54.280 --> 54:55.320
Move!

55:07.280 --> 55:11.760
So! Congratulations, all. We make quite a team!

55:11.800 --> 55:13.360
Yes, we do, sir.

55:13.400 --> 55:17.240
Much as I hate to disappoint you, it seems

55:13.400 --> 55:17.240
it must be short-lived.

55:17.280 --> 55:19.760
Your replacement for Sergeant Best

55:17.280 --> 55:19.760
has arrived.

55:19.800 --> 55:20.800
At last.

55:21.600 --> 55:23.040
Where is he?

55:23.080 --> 55:26.800
Everyone, I'd like you to meet Sergeant Florence Cassell.

55:27.680 --> 55:28.680
Hello.

55:32.520 --> 55:37.960
We met very briefly. He spoke very highly

55:32.520 --> 55:37.960
of you, sir.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.800
Hello. I'm DI Goodman, this is Detective Sergeant

55:38.000 --> 55:41.800
Camille Bordey.

55:41.840 --> 55:44.040
I've heard such good things about you both.

55:44.080 --> 55:45.480
Thank you.

55:45.520 --> 55:48.760
And I've heard a lot about you, too,

55:45.520 --> 55:48.760
Officer Myers.

55:48.800 --> 55:51.160
-Oh, yes.

55:51.200 --> 55:54.280
Anyway. Sergeant, welcome to the team.

55:54.320 --> 55:57.080
Thank you, sir. I can't wait to get started.

56:10.400 --> 56:11.520
Thank you.

56:15.880 --> 56:18.880
So, our film club...

56:18.920 --> 56:20.440
I was thinking,

56:20.480 --> 56:24.040
I found an old film projector. Our second instalment...

56:24.080 --> 56:27.480
No, erm... I'd love to, but I can't tonight,

56:24.080 --> 56:27.480
I'm sorry.

56:27.520 --> 56:29.760
I have a date.

56:29.800 --> 56:31.960
Oh, oh, right. Great.

56:33.800 --> 56:35.800
Yes, erm, good.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.320
Who is he? Just an old school friend.

56:39.720 --> 56:40.800
Oh. I see.

56:43.360 --> 56:46.640
I need to make more of an effort,

56:43.360 --> 56:46.640
don't I? Get out there.

56:46.680 --> 56:50.560
Yes, yes, of course. Ye, no, no, you go out.

56:46.680 --> 56:50.560
Have a great time.

56:50.600 --> 56:53.160
Much better than watching some boring old film

56:50.600 --> 56:53.160
with your boss.

56:54.840 --> 56:55.880
Thank you.

56:58.640 --> 56:59.640
How do I look?

57:03.160 --> 57:04.920
Beautiful.

57:04.960 --> 57:06.520
Now you are a very kind man.

57:08.280 --> 57:10.520
Erm... See you tomorrow.

57:10.560 --> 57:13.640
Yes, erm, and, er, have a great time.

57:13.680 --> 57:14.680
And don't worry about the film.

57:16.080 --> 57:17.160
No, honestly.

57:41.720 --> 57:43.160
Oh, well, old chap,

57:44.240 --> 57:48.840
just means there's more popcorn for us.

57:55.360 --> 57:56.960
Yes, you're right.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.320
I wouldn't eat that all at once,

57:57.000 --> 57:59.320
you might actually explode.

58:00.160 --> 58:02.160
Right, here we go.

58:02.880 --> 58:04.200
<i>When Harry Met Sally.</i>

58:05.000 --> 58:06.600
Entirely in French.

58:07.040 --> 58:08.880
<i>Allez!</i>

58:08.920 --> 58:11.440
DWAYNE: <i> Mr Peters</i> <i>was found dead with</i>

58:08.920 --> 58:11.440
<i>a gunshot wound to the chest.</i>

58:14.000 --> 58:15.080
Jake!

58:15.120 --> 58:17.200
We're here to solve an impossible crime.

58:17.240 --> 58:19.320
Mind if I tag along

58:19.360 --> 58:21.440
As long as you don't call it "the scene"!

58:21.480 --> 58:22.800
Cam! Hey!

58:24.920 --> 58:27.080
You have to kiss a lot of frogs

58:24.920 --> 58:27.080
before you find your prince.

58:27.120 --> 58:28.160
Oh. So you did kiss him, then?

58:29.160 --> 58:31.200
Oh, yeah!

58:31.240 --> 58:33.520
Hold up... He's not waving now, though!
