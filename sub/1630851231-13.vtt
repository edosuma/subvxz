02:29.494 --> 02:31.668
I joined this Bureau
30 years ago.

02:31.737 --> 02:34.084
10 years later, 9/11 happened.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.984
It wasn't a great time to be
a Muslim in New York City.

02:37.053 --> 02:38.227
Trust me.

02:38.296 --> 02:40.884
But the Bureau made me feel
like I belonged,

02:40.953 --> 02:43.301
like I was a part
of the family.

02:43.370 --> 02:44.612
It can be that way
for all of you

02:44.681 --> 02:48.996
if you put in work
and honor the badge.

02:49.065 --> 02:51.171
Special Agent Bashar gave me
that same exact speech

02:51.240 --> 02:53.000
seven years ago
when I was recruited,

02:53.069 --> 02:55.209
and I can promise you
I have no regrets.

02:56.866 --> 03:00.559
Oh, I'm sorry. That is work.

03:00.628 --> 03:03.148

03:03.217 --> 03:07.601
Thank you.

03:07.670 --> 03:09.603
Hey, folks,
NYPD asked us for help

03:09.672 --> 03:10.880
regarding a potential
hate crime.

03:10.949 --> 03:12.226
So listen up.

03:12.295 --> 03:15.574
22-year-old Kosey Khan,
a Pakistani student here

03:15.643 --> 03:17.404
on temporary visa,

03:17.473 --> 03:19.233
had his throat slit last night.

03:19.302 --> 03:21.787
His younger brother,
Amir, was also stabbed,

03:21.856 --> 03:23.755
and he is currently in surgery.

03:23.824 --> 03:25.446
Let's talk about
what we know about the victims.

03:25.515 --> 03:27.379
Yeah.
Kosey was enrolled in Columbia,

03:27.448 --> 03:29.416
an engineering major
at 3.9 GPA.

03:29.485 --> 03:33.765
His younger brother, Amir,
worked at a local restaurant.

03:33.834 --> 03:35.076
Doesn't seem to be here legally.

03:35.145 --> 03:37.665
Neither appear to have
a social media footprint.

03:37.734 --> 03:39.080
Mm-hmm.
What about criminal history?

03:39.149 --> 03:40.323
Anything?
- None.

03:40.392 --> 03:41.945
Not even a parking ticket.

03:42.014 --> 03:42.946
So why them?

03:43.015 --> 03:44.431
Why attack them at their home?

03:44.500 --> 03:46.778
Right, hate crimes typically
happen out on the street,

03:46.847 --> 03:48.711
so maybe there's
a personal connection.

03:48.780 --> 03:50.506
All right, so dig into
the victims' personal lives,

03:50.575 --> 03:52.059
friends, neighbors, classmates,

03:52.128 --> 03:53.957
anyone in their orbit
with hate-related priors,

03:54.026 --> 03:55.890
or racist social media posts.

03:55.959 --> 03:57.651
The answers are out there.
Let's find them.

03:59.204 --> 04:00.792
Upstairs neighbor
called it in.

04:00.861 --> 04:02.759
Heard someone yelling for help.

04:02.828 --> 04:04.174
Uniforms knocked
and didn't get an answer,

04:04.244 --> 04:07.592
so they made entry
and found the victims.

04:07.661 --> 04:09.559
- Any signs of forced entry?
- None.

04:09.628 --> 04:12.044
Door was unlocked.

04:12.113 --> 04:13.563
There cameras
in this building?

04:13.632 --> 04:14.633
Negative.

04:14.702 --> 04:16.221
Place is as basic as they come.

04:16.290 --> 04:19.051
Rent's cheap,
and the amenities reflect it.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.260
It's not the best neighborhood.

04:20.329 --> 04:21.433
Doors stay locked.

04:21.502 --> 04:23.021
So our suspect was either
invited in,

04:23.090 --> 04:25.057
or he waited for the victims
to open the door.

04:25.126 --> 04:26.196
All right,
we're gonna need your help

04:26.266 --> 04:27.508
canvassing the area
for witnesses.

04:27.577 --> 04:29.199
Yeah.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.615
Maggie.

04:30.684 --> 04:33.687
A ton of valuable
electronics untouched.

04:36.345 --> 04:38.657
Maybe they were looking
for money or drugs.

04:38.726 --> 04:40.418
What makes you think
it was a hate crime?

04:40.487 --> 04:41.971
Well, I wasn't sure at first.

04:42.040 --> 04:44.387
But the victims' Imam showed up
about an hour ago,

04:44.456 --> 04:46.078
said he had proof
that they were targeted.

04:46.147 --> 04:47.632
What kind of proof?

04:47.701 --> 04:49.116
Something about domestic
terrorist threats

04:49.185 --> 04:50.600
against these kids' lives.

04:50.669 --> 04:51.739
I told him because of that,

04:51.808 --> 04:54.155
we need to bring the FBI
on board.

04:54.224 --> 04:57.469
He wasn't exactly thrilled
to hear that.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.543
- Omar!
- I'm Agent Bell.

05:02.612 --> 05:03.579
This is Agent Zidan.

05:06.375 --> 05:08.584
How are you, Omar?
It's been a long time.

05:08.653 --> 05:09.861

Haven't seen you
at the mosque in years.

05:16.488 --> 05:19.526
Is that because of the job,
or do you no longer worship?

05:19.595 --> 05:20.941
No, no, no.
Of course I still worship.

05:21.010 --> 05:22.770

a little crazy,

Uh, we understand you have
information about the attack.

05:28.949 --> 05:31.848
Not just an attack.
It was a hate crime.

05:31.917 --> 05:33.471
Four days ago, I saw a man

05:33.540 --> 05:36.266
threaten these boys
outside my mosque.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.302
What do you mean "threaten"?

05:37.371 --> 05:38.579
He called them terrorists,

05:38.648 --> 05:40.409
told them to go back
to their country.

05:40.478 --> 05:42.859
You know, that kind of thing.

05:42.928 --> 05:45.414
It would've turned violent too,
but I chased him away.

05:45.483 --> 05:47.001
What did this guy look like?

05:47.070 --> 05:51.074
White, in his 20s,
medium build.

05:51.143 --> 05:53.560
He was wearing a hoodie,
so I couldn't see his face.

05:53.629 --> 05:54.699
Okay, you chased them away.

05:54.768 --> 05:56.114
Did they get away by foot
or by car?

before he attacked?

Yeah, well, I mean,
we would've

06:02.707 --> 06:04.502

- You did!

06:04.571 --> 06:06.780
I called the FBI

06:06.849 --> 06:08.195
I talked to an agent about it.

06:08.264 --> 06:10.680

The suspects were originally

33:26.590 --> 33:28.661
from a rural village
called Shatoy.

33:28.730 --> 33:32.355
Apparently there was some

33:32.424 --> 33:34.219

their loved ones

33:47.370 --> 33:48.405
were killed
by Russian military.

33:48.474 --> 33:49.682

33:51.029 --> 33:52.720

that the Russian special forces
believed to be responsible

33:54.894 --> 33:56.862

of Dmitry Borchin,

33:56.931 --> 33:58.691

as "the Beast of the Forest."
