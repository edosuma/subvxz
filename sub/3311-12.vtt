00:06.640 --> 00:09.177
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.079
JOE, JOE, CHECK THIS OUT.

00:11.112 --> 00:14.215
YOU WERE MENTIONED ON THE FRONT
PAGE OF "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL."

00:14.248 --> 00:16.617
THEY'RE ALL SORT OF THE FRONT
PAGE WITH THESE THINGS.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.619
- BUT LOOKIE!
- DON'T BE SO SURPRISED, BURKE.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.454
I ACTUALLY HAD A
LIFE BEFORE THIS.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.756
I JUST DIDN'T SHOW UP ON
YOUR DOORSTEP IN A BASKET.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.558
WELL, I'M PROUD.
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY

00:24.592 --> 00:26.694
YOUR NANNY GETS INK IN A
NATIONAL PUBLICATION.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.197
WELL, IT'S NOT EVERY DAY
THAT I'M YOUR NANNY.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.332
Both: THANK GOD.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.601
"JOE LONGO, FORMER V.P.
AT SCANLON FINANCIAL,

00:33.634 --> 00:36.003
WAS THE EXECUTIVE WHO
PLUCKED KEVIN SHATKIN

00:36.036 --> 00:38.539
FROM HIS JOB IN THE MAIL
ROOM," WHATEVER WHATEVER.

00:38.572 --> 00:42.743
"SHATKIN SECURED $1.7... BILLION

00:42.776 --> 00:44.712
IN BACKING FOR HIS
NEW HEDGE FUND."

00:44.745 --> 00:48.416
RAT-FACED SHATKIN?
THAT LITTLE SLEASEL?

00:48.449 --> 00:49.717
THAT GUY... HE USED
TO WORK FOR ME...

00:49.750 --> 00:51.652
HE COULDN'T EVEN GET
MY COFFEE ORDER RIGHT

00:51.685 --> 00:53.721
- AND THEY JUST GAVE HIM A BILLION DOLLARS?
- 1.7.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.389
- OHH!
- ( clatters )

00:55.423 --> 00:58.226
HEY, I JUST FIGURED
THAT THING OUT.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.527
SORRY.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.695
OH HEY, IT STILL WORKS.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.030
I'LL TELL YOU, BURKE,

01:03.063 --> 01:05.566
THEY MAKE SOMETHING
IN THE GOOD OLD...

01:05.599 --> 01:08.302
ROMANIA AND IT STAYS MADE.

01:08.336 --> 01:10.471
LOOK, I'M SORRY, JOE.
I DIDN'T READ IT.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.673
I JUST, YOU KNOW, SAW YOUR
NAME AND I DIDN'T REALIZE

01:12.706 --> 01:15.276
- IT WAS GONNA...
- BE LIKE THROWING ACID IN MY EYES?

01:15.309 --> 01:18.112
LOOK, JOE, YOU'RE DOWN,
BUT YOU'RE NOT OUT.

01:18.146 --> 01:19.680
I'M GONNA BE BACK IN
THE FINANCIAL WORLD.

01:19.713 --> 01:22.583
- YOU MARK MY WORDS, BURKE.
- ABSOLUTELY. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

01:22.616 --> 01:25.186
SO WHAT ARE WE
HAVING FOR DINNER?

01:25.219 --> 01:27.621
I WAS THE FIRST PERSON IN MY
BUSINESS SCHOOL TO MAKE V.P.

01:27.655 --> 01:30.458
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT JOE LONGO
ALWAYS MADE HIS INVESTORS MONEY.

01:30.491 --> 01:33.461
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU JUST TAKE
IT EASY TONIGHT. WE'LL ORDER IN.

01:33.494 --> 01:36.197
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THEY GAVE
SHATKIN A BILLION DOLLARS.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.366
HE'S OUT THERE BUILDING
HIS GLOBAL EMPIRE

01:38.399 --> 01:41.269
AND I'M IN HERE BUILDING
A METAL RACK...

01:41.302 --> 01:43.437
TO AVOID DOING THE LAUNDRY.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.773
LOOK, JOE, YOU ARE
FANTASTIC AT WHAT YOU DO.

01:45.806 --> 01:48.442
AND IF THERE WERE SUCH A THING, I
BET YOU WOULD BE ON THE FRONT PAGE

01:48.476 --> 01:51.412
OF "THE WALL STREET... NANNY."

01:51.445 --> 01:54.748
BURKE, PROMISE ME YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
VOLUNTEER FOR A SUICIDE HOTLINE.

01:56.350 --> 01:59.587
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK ♪

01:59.620 --> 02:01.555
♪ WITH ME ♪

02:03.657 --> 02:07.595
AND HERE ARE YOUR NOTES FROM
FIFTH PERIOD CHEMISTRY.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.497
THANKS, BECKETT.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.199
WHAT'S WITH THE
DIFFERENT COLOR PAPER?

02:11.232 --> 02:14.134
I USED THE NATIONAL
TERROR ALERT SYSTEM

02:14.168 --> 02:17.705
TO COLOR-CODE THEM BY LIKELIHOOD
OF BEING ON THE FINAL.

02:17.738 --> 02:21.742
WOW, WAY TO USE YOUR
LETHAL POWERS OF O.C.D.

02:21.775 --> 02:22.876
YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON

02:22.910 --> 02:25.246
TO EVEN NOTICE MY COLOR-CODING.

02:25.279 --> 02:27.181
AND MAY I SAY YOUR
EYES ARE THE COLOR

02:27.215 --> 02:28.849
OF THE HIGHEST ALERT FOR BEAUTY.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.753
SO I'LL TEXT YOU BY
THE END OF THE WEEK

02:32.786 --> 02:33.787
AND WE CAN SET UP A DATE.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.690
- A DATE?
- TO STUDY.

02:36.724 --> 02:39.893
OH, YEAH SURE. THAT'D BE...

02:39.927 --> 02:41.429
THAT'D BE GREAT.

02:41.462 --> 02:44.598
AND ALSO IF YOU EVER NEED
ANY HELP WRITING PAPERS,

02:44.632 --> 02:46.867
I COULD WRITE THEM FOR YOU.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.669
NO THANKS.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.638
APPRECIATE THE HELP
WITH CHEMISTRY THOUGH.

02:50.671 --> 02:54.675
ANYTIME. SERIOUSLY, ANYTIME.

02:55.909 --> 02:58.612
BYE.

03:00.381 --> 03:01.749
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE
DOING HERE, LENNOX.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.884
YOU'RE USING THAT POOR KID
TO GET AHEAD IN SCHOOL.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.919
DUH.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.188
YOU REALLY THINK IT'S OKAY
THAT YOU'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE

03:08.222 --> 03:10.624
OF THAT LITTLE NERD...
UH, SWEET KID?

03:10.658 --> 03:12.926
HE GOT SOMETHING
OUT OF IT TOO...

03:12.960 --> 03:15.463
THE JOY OF BEING NEAR ME.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.931
I SEE. AND HE CAN THINK BACK
TO THAT BEAUTIFUL MOMENT

03:17.965 --> 03:19.900
THE NEXT TIME THAT
HE'S GETTING KILLED

03:19.933 --> 03:21.635
BY A WIZARD ONLINE?

03:22.770 --> 03:24.638
OKAY, I GOT YOUR EMAIL.

03:24.672 --> 03:25.939
WHAT'S THE BIG
MEETING ALL ABOUT?

03:25.973 --> 03:27.775
MISS BURKE, TAKE A SEAT.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.877
OH NO, NOT ANOTHER INTERVENTION.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.879
I'VE ALREADY GOTTEN RID
OF SO MANY OF MY VICES.

03:31.912 --> 03:34.282
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LEFT
EXCEPT PURSES AND CHOCOLATE.

03:34.315 --> 03:35.716
PLEASE DON'T TAKE
AWAY MY PURSES.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.751
THAT'S WHERE I KEEP
MY CHOCOLATES.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.953
- THIS IS A MEETING ABOUT THE FUTURE.
- PLEASE DON'T QUIT.

03:39.987 --> 03:42.256
- I'LL BE BETTER! I'LL WASH A DISH!
- I'M NOT QUITTING.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.458
WILL YOU TAKE A SEAT, PLEASE?

03:44.492 --> 03:46.226
OKAY, LOOK, HERE IS THE DEAL.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.796
FOR YEARS I'VE BEEN KEEPING
NOTES OF FINANCIAL ADVICE

03:48.829 --> 03:51.299
AND I'VE FINALLY PULLED IT
ALL TOGETHER INTO AN eBOOK.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.634
AND I AM STARTING
MY OWN COMPANY.

03:53.667 --> 03:57.271
OOH! LONG-CO,
LONGO-CO, LONGOCORP,

03:57.305 --> 03:59.707
INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF LONGO!

03:59.740 --> 04:01.742
USE ANY OF 'EM.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.711
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.579
ANYWAY, I'M GONNA
CREATE A WEBSITE.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.915
I'M GONNA MAKE FINANCIAL
VIDEOS ONLINE

04:07.948 --> 04:09.717
THAT SUPPORT THE
SALE OF MY BOOK.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.785
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT

04:11.819 --> 04:13.687
OBVIOUSLY RIGHT NOW I
CAN'T GET A BANK LOAN.

04:13.721 --> 04:16.724
OH, YOU NEED TO BORROW MONEY.

04:16.757 --> 04:17.858
- OKAY.
- NO NO NO NO!

04:17.891 --> 04:19.893
I DON'T NEED TO BORROW MONEY.
THIS IS NOT A HAND-OUT.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.829
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY
FOR YOU TO GET INVOLVED

04:21.862 --> 04:23.931
AS AN INVESTOR ON THE
GROUND FLOOR OF MY COMPANY.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.467
GOT IT, GOT IT, GOT IT.
SO HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED?

04:26.500 --> 04:30.471
I'M GONNA NEED $5,000
IN START-UP CAPITAL

04:30.504 --> 04:33.507
FOR WEB DESIGN, HOSTING
AND BANDWIDTH...

04:33.541 --> 04:36.910
- OKAY, $5,000.
- WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.912
DON'T YOU WANNA SEE MY
POWERPOINT PRESENTATION?

04:38.946 --> 04:41.449
NO, JOE, IT'S OKAY. I DON'T
NEED TO SEE ANYTHING.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.716
- I TRUST YOU.
- NO NO NO NO.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.885
COME HERE, COME HERE, COME
HERE, LOOK LOOK LOOK.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.355
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT
MY PROSPECTUS, OKAY?

04:47.388 --> 04:48.989
HERE.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.824
- LET'S SEE.
- YEAH.

04:50.858 --> 04:53.794
- SO... CHARTS, GRAPHS.
- SEE THAT...? WAIT A MINUTE. BUT THAT'S...

04:53.827 --> 04:56.564
OH YAY! OKAY. AND I'M WRITING.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.666
AND HERE IS YOUR CHECK.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.434
THIS IS NOT HOW IT WORKS, OKAY?

05:00.468 --> 05:02.736
I MAKE A PRESENTATION AND THEN YOU
SAY, "WOW, THAT WAS REALLY GREAT.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.605
LET ME THINK ABOUT IT AND
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU."

05:04.638 --> 05:08.342
OKAY, LET ME THINK ABOUT IT
AND I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

05:08.376 --> 05:10.578
YAY!

05:11.912 --> 05:14.882
IS THIS A PITY CHECK? ARE YOU JUST
DOING THIS BECAUSE YOU LIKE ME?

05:14.915 --> 05:16.950
NO, I DON'T LIKE YOU.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.886
THAT'S HOW MUCH I
BELIEVE IN YOU.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.888
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S SHAKE ON IT.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.890
SHAKE? NO NO NO NO NO.
I'VE DRAWN UP CONTRACTS.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.992
I ACTUALLY HAVE A NOTARY COMING
OVER LATER THIS AFTERNOON.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.326
WHO NEEDS A NOTARY?

05:26.360 --> 05:28.295
IT'S A FRIENDLY TRANSACTION
BETWEEN FRIENDS.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.364
NO NO NO, THIS IS A
BUSINESS TRANSACTION

05:30.398 --> 05:31.999
BETWEEN BUSINESS PARTNERS.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.702
OKAY, PARTNER. DEAL?

05:34.735 --> 05:36.870
( sighs ) DEAL.

05:36.904 --> 05:39.573
( squeals ) THIS IS SO EXCITING!

05:39.607 --> 05:42.042
TEAM BURKE-LONGO!
OKAY, LONGO-BURKE.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.412
I DON'T HAVE AN EGO
ABOUT THESE THINGS,

05:44.445 --> 05:47.615
BUT JUST BURKE-LONGO
SOUNDS BETTER.

05:47.648 --> 05:50.651
MEL, LOOK, WE ARE NOT
PARTNERS-PARTNERS.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.787
OKAY? WE ARE PARTNER-
SILENT PARTNER.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.556
SO SHH.

05:55.589 --> 05:56.857
- BUT...
- NAH AH AH.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.792
I JUST SAID SILENT
PARTNER, OKAY?

05:58.826 --> 06:00.761
HERE, I REFER YOU
TO MY PROSPECTUS.

06:00.794 --> 06:03.631
AND LET ME REFER
YOU TO MY CHECK.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.734
BESIDES, I DON'T
REALLY DO SILENT.

06:06.767 --> 06:10.003
ASK ANY OF MY OTHER PARTNERS.
I MAKE A LOT OF NOISE.

06:16.510 --> 06:19.046
- VERY LOUD.
- THAT'S SO GROSS.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.753
SO HOW ARE THE OPENING
CREDITS COMING ALONG, BUDDY?

06:25.786 --> 06:28.756
- IT'S A LITTLE ROUGH, BUT HERE, TAKE A LOOK.
- ALL RIGHT.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.791
OKAY.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.760
( hip-hop music playing )

06:42.670 --> 06:44.638
WOW, THAT IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.974
I GOTTA LIKE THE PRICE, RIGHT?
TAKING YOU TO SEE A MOVIE.

06:47.007 --> 06:50.644
NO NO, NOT JUST ANY MOVIE. WE'RE
TALKING "TRON: LEGACY" IN DECEMBER...

06:50.678 --> 06:52.379
OPENING WEEKEND, MIDNIGHT SHOW,

06:52.412 --> 06:54.715
BOTTOMLESS NACHOS.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.383
YOU DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.652
SO HOW QUICK CAN YOUR WEBMASTER
TURN THIS WHOLE THING AROUND?

06:58.686 --> 07:01.689
WELL, LARRY'S GOT
MARCHING BAND ON TUESDAY

07:01.722 --> 07:04.124
AND ALLERGY SHOTS ON THURSDAY.

07:04.157 --> 07:07.661
BUT I THINK HE CAN FIT YOU IN
LIVE BEFORE MID-TERMS FRIDAY.

07:07.695 --> 07:10.564
I'VE GOT A REAL CRACK TEAM.

07:10.598 --> 07:13.701
HEY, GUYS. JUST THOUGHT
I'D DROP BY THE SET

07:13.734 --> 07:15.435
AND SEE HOW THE SHOOT IS GOING.

07:15.469 --> 07:16.870
YOU KNOW, CHAT UP
THE CAST AND CREW.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.906
- IT'S GOING FINE.
- GREAT GOOD.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.575
SO, JOE, I WANTED TO RUN
SOME OF MY IDEAS PAST YOU

07:21.609 --> 07:22.976
BEFORE YOU GET STARTED.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.012
YOU'RE A LITTLE LATE.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.581
YOU SHOT THE FIRST
ONE WITHOUT ME?

07:27.615 --> 07:30.651
- NO, WE SHOT THE FIRST THREE WITHOUT YOU.
- BUT I'M A PARTNER!

07:30.684 --> 07:32.820
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE LOOP.
I WAS NOT LOOPED.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.722
RELAX, ALL RIGHT? WE DIDN'T
REALLY SHOOT THAT MUCH.

07:34.755 --> 07:37.057
WE JUST SHOT A FEW OF THE VIDEOS
SO YOU WOULD HAVE SOMETHING

07:37.090 --> 07:39.560
TO COME DOWN HERE AND LOOK AT
AND MAKE YOUR COMMENTS ON.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.562
MM-HMM MM-HMM. YOU'RE JUST
TRYING TO GET AROUND ME.

07:41.595 --> 07:42.996
NO. RIGHT?

07:43.030 --> 07:45.566
THAT WAS NOT HIS
EXACT PLAN AT ALL.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.001
THANKS, KID. AHEM.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.838
COME ON OVER HERE AND
TAKE A LOOK, PARTNER.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.175
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

07:55.208 --> 07:58.746
( flatly ) Welcome
to "Joe Knows."

07:58.779 --> 08:00.047
I am Joe Longo

08:00.080 --> 08:04.017
and today's subject:
futures contracts.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.820
What are they? How
can you use them?

08:06.854 --> 08:10.524
You may not know, but Joe knows.

08:13.661 --> 08:16.997
...is an agreement to
take or make delivery

08:17.030 --> 08:20.701
on a date in the "future."

08:20.734 --> 08:22.736
If you like what you heard,

08:22.770 --> 08:25.873
order your copy of
"Monetizing Your Future:

08:25.906 --> 08:28.976
Investment Tools for
the 22nd Century."

08:29.009 --> 08:31.579
I'm Joe Longo and
this has been...

08:31.612 --> 08:33.681
VERY PAINFUL.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.515
HOW LONG WAS THAT?

08:35.549 --> 08:37.718
18 MINUTES, 22 SECONDS.

08:37.751 --> 08:40.120
I FEEL LIKE I JUST
DIED SIX TIMES.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.756
THOSE ARE WAY TOO LONG. I
MEAN THESE ARE WEBCASTS.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.625
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
TINY NUGGETS OF WISDOM,

08:44.658 --> 08:46.894
NOT BIG BOULDERS OF BOREDOM.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.830
EVERYTHING IN THERE IS
ESSENTIAL INFORMATION.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.932
JOE, HERE'S HOW THE
INTERNET WORKS:

08:51.965 --> 08:54.001
CLICK... I WANNA SEE THE
CAT PLAY THE PIANO.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.604
CLICK... I WANNA SEE THE
DRAMATIC CHIPMUNK. CLICK...

08:56.637 --> 08:58.639
( British accent )
"CHARLIE BIT MY FINGER!"

08:58.672 --> 09:00.641
- ( giggles )
- PARDON MY TRUTH,

09:00.674 --> 09:03.811
BUT I'M THE ONE WITH THE MASTERS DEGREE HERE
AND YOU HAVE NO EXPERIENCE IN BUSINESS.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.979
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
EXPERIENCE IS OVERRATED.

09:06.013 --> 09:08.048
I GOT INTO POLITICS
WITH NO EXPERIENCE.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.017
DON'T GET HER WRONG...
SHE KNEW ALL THE ISSUES.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.085
DON'T GET ME WRONG... I
KNEW ALL THE ISSUES.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.721
YOU KNOW, I HAD THEM DOWN,

09:13.754 --> 09:15.856
I MEAN, BUT ANYBODY
CAN SPOUT THE ISSUES.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.991
I HAD SOMETHING THE OTHER
CANDIDATES DIDN'T HAVE.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.827
A DADDY IN THE SENATOR BUSINESS?

09:19.860 --> 09:21.829
NO. LIKABILITY.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.864
YOU POST THESE, NOBODY'S
GONNA WATCH 'EM.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.967
LOOK, I APPRECIATE THE INPUT.
CONSIDER IT CONSIDERED.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.269
BUT WE ARE GOING TO POST
THESE WEBCASTS AS THEY ARE.

09:29.302 --> 09:32.773
CONTACT HOMELAND SECURITY BECAUSE
THERE'S GONNA BE A BIG BOMB.

09:40.714 --> 09:44.752
OH NO, STOP. MY ESSAY
WASN'T THAT GOOD.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.854
WELL, YOU HELPED ME A
LOT, SO THANK YOU.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.789
NO, THANK YOU.

09:48.822 --> 09:51.258
( giggles ) OKAY, BECKETT. BYE.

09:51.291 --> 09:54.094
LENNOX, IF THAT KID IS
DOING SOMETHING FOR YOU,

09:54.127 --> 09:56.730
YOU REALLY SHOULD GIVE
HIM SOMETHING IN RETURN.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.899
WAIT, LET ME REPHRASE THAT.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.001
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

10:01.034 --> 10:04.672
- BECKETT'S JUST A SWEET GUY.
- REALLY? BECAUSE THE OTHER DAY

10:04.705 --> 10:07.808
YOU CALLED HIM THE BASTARD LOVE
CHILD OF BILL GATES AND A ROBOT.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.779
GEEKS ARE PEOPLE TOO.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.715
OKAY, YES, BECKETT IS GEEKY

10:14.748 --> 10:18.819
AND NERDY AND EVERYTHING.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.620
BUT HE'S ALSO KIND OF CUTE.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.656
OOH!

10:22.690 --> 10:24.257
YOU LIKE HIM!

10:24.291 --> 10:27.327
OH NO.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.062
( sighs ) IT'S OKAY.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.064
"SHORT SELLING,
OR SELLING SHORT,

10:31.098 --> 10:33.300
INVOLVES BORROWING A
SECURITY FROM A BROKER

10:33.333 --> 10:36.336
AND SELLING IT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING
THAT IT MUST BE BOUGHT BACK

10:36.369 --> 10:38.305
AND RETURNED TO THE
BROKER LATER."

10:38.338 --> 10:41.709
YOU SEE THAT? I CUT OUT A BUNCH OF STUFF.
I REALLY THINK IT'S SINGING NOW.

10:41.742 --> 10:44.211
YEAH, JOE, YOU MAY WANT
TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.246
THE SITE'S BEEN
UP FOR THREE DAYS

10:46.279 --> 10:49.883
- AND WE'VE ONLY GOTTEN...
- 17 HITS? THAT'S IT?

10:49.917 --> 10:52.786
- THAT'S PATHETIC.
- HEY, HOW'S THE TRAFFIC TODAY?

10:52.820 --> 10:55.723
I CHECKED THE SITE 16
TIMES JUST TO SEE.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.725
- UH...
- LET'S JUST SAY THERE'S NO DANGER

10:57.758 --> 10:59.059
OF RUNNING OUT OF BANDWIDTH.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.994
- WE GOT 17 HITS.
- WHAT?

11:01.028 --> 11:04.732
THOSE BOOKS ARE NOT FLYING
OFF THE VIRTUAL SHELF?

11:04.765 --> 11:06.734
YOU DON'T NEED TO GLOAT, BURKE.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.035
THAT WASN'T GLOATING.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.738
THIS IS GLOATING: ( giggles )

11:10.771 --> 11:13.907
JOE, BELIEVE ME, I WANT YOUR
BUSINESS TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

11:13.941 --> 11:15.843
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.
I'VE BEEN MAKING

11:15.876 --> 11:17.978
SUCCESSFUL PRESENTATIONS
IN BOARDROOMS FOR YEARS.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.914
YES, AS A SUIT SELLING
TO OTHER SUITS.

11:20.948 --> 11:22.916
BUT NOW YOU HAVE TO APPEAL TO
A WHOLE DIFFERENT AUDIENCE.

11:22.950 --> 11:25.652
COME ON, LET ME HELP YOU.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.687
I'LL BE LIKE YOUR
MEDIA CONSULTANT.

11:27.721 --> 11:30.157
I'LL GIVE YOU MY INPUT AND YOU CAN
DO WITH IT WHATEVER YOU WANT.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.794
- AS LONG AS I TAKE IT.
- 17 HITS.

11:33.827 --> 11:36.797
FINE, WRITE DOWN YOUR THOUGHTS AND
WE'LL TOSS THEM AROUND LATER.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.766
LET'S TOSS RIGHT NOW.

11:38.799 --> 11:41.168
FIRST OF ALL, YOU HAVE TO BE
MORE APPROACHABLE AND CASUAL.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.070
YOU KNOW, LESS
BANKERY AND SUITY.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.672
- LOSE THE SHINY DUDS.
- THIS IS HUGO BOSS.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.942
YEAH, IT REPRESENTS
"THE MAN," OKAY?

11:48.976 --> 11:52.245
CHANGE INTO SOMETHING MORE
ACCESSIBLE AND TIGHT.

11:52.279 --> 11:55.816
SO YOU REALLY THINK THE WAY TO SELL MY
FINANCE BOOK IS BY WEARING A TIGHTER SHIRT?

11:55.849 --> 11:58.351
- IT'S CALLED BRANDING.
- BRANDING?

11:58.385 --> 12:00.053
THAT MAKES SENSE, BECAUSE, YEAH,

12:00.087 --> 12:01.822
I DO FEEL LIKE A PIECE OF MEAT.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.757
WE'RE CREATING AN IMAGE.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.325
ANYBODY CAN GIVE
FINANCIAL ADVICE.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.360
BUT HOW DOES JOE LONGO
GIVE FINANCIAL ADVICE?

12:07.394 --> 12:08.996
NOT HALF-NAKED.

12:09.029 --> 12:11.698
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, JUST TRY IT, OKAY?
A LITTLE REHEARSAL.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.734
NOW REMEMBER: PERSONABLE,
LIKEABLE, CASUAL.

12:14.768 --> 12:15.936
AND GO!

12:17.437 --> 12:19.840
( stilted ) THIS IS "JOE
KNOWS" WITH JOE LONGO.

12:19.873 --> 12:22.810
- I'M JOE LONGO.
- CUT! STOP, NO.

12:22.843 --> 12:25.412
WHAT? I'M WEARING THE SHIRT
YOU WANT ME TO WEAR.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.414
WHAT'S NEXT? YOU WANT ME
TO LAY ON A BEAR RUG?

12:27.447 --> 12:30.851
LOOK, I JUST WANT YOU TO BE RELAXED, OKAY?
HERE'S A LITTLE TECHNIQUE

12:30.884 --> 12:33.887
I LEARNED IN A PUBLIC SPEAKING COURSE
I TOOK AT THE LEARNING ANNEX...

12:33.921 --> 12:36.056
AH AH, WERE YOU THERE AUDITING

12:36.089 --> 12:39.492
OR DID YOU STAY BOTH WEEKS
AND GET THE FULL M.B.A.?

12:39.526 --> 12:42.462
OKAY, WHAT YOU WANNA DO
IS YOU WANNA ASSOCIATE

12:42.495 --> 12:44.731
PUBLIC SPEAKING WITH
RELAXATION AND COMFORT.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.333
SO WHEN I WAS DOING
MY ELECTION CAMPAIGN,

12:46.366 --> 12:47.835
I USED TO REHEARSE
IN A BUBBLE BATH.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.803
SO THEN WHEN I GAVE
THE ACTUAL SPEECH,

12:49.837 --> 12:51.771
I WAS ABLE TO HOLD
ON TO THAT FEELING.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.273
SO THE QUESTION
IS WHAT MAKES YOU

12:53.306 --> 12:55.075
COMFORTABLE AND RELAXED?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.779
BESIDES THAT.

12:59.813 --> 13:02.349
OKAY, LET'S SEE.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.217
I GET AN ENDORPHIN
RUSH WHEN I WORK OUT.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.119
GOOD GOOD. LET'S TRY THAT.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.755
PICK UP ONE OF THOSE
MUSCLE-LIFTY THINGS.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.825
FINE. "MUSCLE-LIFTY THING."

13:13.226 --> 13:16.796
- ALL RIGHT.
- NOW GIVE YOUR SPIEL.

13:19.967 --> 13:23.003
FUTURES CONTRACTS REPRESENT AN
AGREEMENT TO TAKE OR MAKE DELIVERY

13:23.036 --> 13:25.405
OF A COMMODITY ON A PARTICULAR
DATE IN THE FUTURE...

13:25.438 --> 13:27.474
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- NO NO NO, IT'S WORKING.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.242
YOU'RE ALMOST WATCHABLE, YEAH.

13:29.276 --> 13:32.345
KEEP... KEEP TALKING.
KEEP PUMPING.

13:32.379 --> 13:35.515
COMMODITIES CAN BE,
SAY, YOU KNOW, COFFEE,

13:35.548 --> 13:37.217
COTTON, CATTLE, AND OF COURSE

13:37.250 --> 13:40.020
EVERYBODY'S FAVORITE...
GOOD OLD PORK BELLIES.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.821
HEY, I THINK WE GOT IT.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.323
YEAH, I THINK WE
FOUND YOUR BRAND.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.558
YOU'VE GOT THIS WHOLE HUNKY,
MANLY THING GOING ON.

13:45.592 --> 13:48.028
I THINK YOU SHOULD DO THE
WEBCASTS JUST LIKE THIS.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.097
ARE YOU SERIOUS? WHILE
I'M WORKING OUT?

13:50.130 --> 13:51.231
YEAH. OOH OOH!

13:51.264 --> 13:54.134
YOUR ANGLE COULD BE
"PUMP UP YOUR PROFITS."

13:54.167 --> 13:56.303
YEAH, YOU JUST... YOU
KNOW, YOU DO THE THING

13:56.336 --> 13:59.940
AND GRUNT A LITTLE AND YOU LET
LOOSE WITH THE BLAH BLAH.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.109
MEL, I'M GONNA LOOK RIDICULOUS.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.844
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LOOK RIDICULOUS
FLYING ON YOUR PRIVATE LEARJET

14:04.878 --> 14:06.980
MADE OF SOLID GOLD FROM ALL
THE BOOKS YOU'RE GONNA SELL.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.381
TRUST YOUR CONSULTANT. COME ON.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.951
I GOT MEL BURKE ELECTED
TO CITY COUNCIL.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.420
THAT'S NO EASY TASK WITH THIS
LIGHTWEIGHT'S BACKGROUND.

14:13.453 --> 14:17.324
ALL RIGHT, AND ACTION!

14:17.357 --> 14:19.592
OH HEY, WHAT'S UP?

14:19.626 --> 14:22.529
THIS IS "JOE KNOWS" WITH
JOE LONGO, AND THAT'S ME.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.965
SO TODAY WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING
ABOUT FUTURES, ALL RIGHT?

14:24.998 --> 14:26.466
FUTURES ARE REALLY
JUST AN AGREEMENT

14:26.499 --> 14:29.036
TO BUY SOME COMMODITY
SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.981
- HEY, GUYS.
- HEY, JOE, COME HERE AND LOOK.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.882
WE PUT UP THE NEW
WEBISODE TWO HOURS AGO

14:42.916 --> 14:44.952
AND WE ALREADY HAVE
1,000 UNIQUE VISITORS.

14:44.985 --> 14:47.120
- WE'RE A HIT.
- THAT'S FANTASTIC!

14:47.154 --> 14:48.855
JOE LONGO IS BACK, BABY!

14:48.888 --> 14:50.357
HOW MANY BOOK
ORDERS HAVE WE HAD?

14:50.390 --> 14:53.160
UM, LET'S SEE. HERE IT IS.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.894
NONE.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.396
ZERO?

14:56.429 --> 14:58.331
WELL, IF YOU ROUND UP.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.033
YEAH, BUT LOOK AT THE COMMENTS.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.235
"JOE KNOWS WHAT I
LIKE." "HOT HOT HOT!"

15:02.269 --> 15:05.138
"HE CAN SHAKE MY
MONEY TREE ANYTIME."

15:05.172 --> 15:07.074
PEOPLE ARE LOVING IT.
I DON'T KNOW.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.376
LOOKS LIKE YOUR CONSULTANT
CAME THROUGH FOR YOU.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.145
YEAH, BUT NOBODY'S BUYING THE BOOK,
SO WHAT THE HECK IS THE POINT?

15:12.179 --> 15:14.581
AND LOOK AT THESE COMMENTS.
WHAT THE HECK ARE THESE?

15:14.614 --> 15:16.583
"I'M INTERESTED IN
HIGH-YIELD RETURNS, JOE.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.219
CAN YOU TAKE OFF YOUR PANTS?"

15:20.587 --> 15:22.455
AND THIS ONE I CAN'T EVEN SAY

15:22.489 --> 15:24.157
WITH THE KID IN THE ROOM.

15:24.191 --> 15:26.393
YEAH, THAT ONE WAS PRETTY FUNNY.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.462
IN A WAY THAT DEEPLY OFFENDS ME.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.466
HEY, DID YOU GUYS SEE THIS EMAIL?
LOOK AT THIS.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.169
NICK'S SPORTING GOODS WANTS
TO MAKE AN ADVERTISING DEAL.

15:36.203 --> 15:38.238
THEY LOVE YOUR WORKOUT. THEY
WANT TO SPONSOR THE SITE.

15:38.271 --> 15:41.341
- WOW. SERIOUSLY?
- JOE, HERE'S YOUR GOLD MINE.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.076
FOCUS THE WEBCAST
ON THE WORKOUT.

15:43.110 --> 15:46.113
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING TO.
FOLLOW THE MONEY.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.982
NO! LOOK, THIS IS NOT
ABOUT FINANCE, MEL.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.483
- THIS IS NOT WHAT I SET OUT TO DO.
- I'M SORRY,

15:50.517 --> 15:52.352
BUT COLUMBUS DIDN'T SET
OUT TO DISCOVER AMERICA,

15:52.385 --> 15:55.222
BUT I'D SAY THAT WORKED OUT PRETTY
WELL FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED.

15:55.255 --> 15:58.658
EXCEPT FOR, YOU KNOW,
ALL THE INDIANS.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.294
LOOK, I'M NOT DOING THIS
PUMPING AND PIMPING THING.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.696
- NO, I AM NOT SELLING OUT.
- OKAY.

16:03.730 --> 16:06.266
THEN I GUESS FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN HIS BUSINESS LIFE,

16:06.299 --> 16:09.469
JOE LONGO IS GONNA POST A LOSS.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.606
MEET ME IN THE GARAGE
IN 15 MINUTES, DUDE.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.175
WE'RE DOING AB CRUNCHES.

16:15.208 --> 16:19.179
- AND, UH... AND TAX TIPS?
- NO.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.114
JUST FREAKIN' AB CRUNCHES.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.554
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE REALLY GOT
THE CONCEPTS DOWN, LENNOX.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.389
YOU'LL ACE THE FINAL.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.191
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE
IT WITHOUT YOU.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.992
TRUE DAT.

16:33.026 --> 16:35.362
SO THAT'S ABOUT IT.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.230
OH WAIT, YOU'VE GOT A
COOKIE CRUMB ON YOUR LIP.

16:37.264 --> 16:39.132
YEAH, I'VE GOTTA GO.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.968
BUT YOU WERE GONNA TELL ME
ABOUT THE SPACE PROGRAM

16:42.001 --> 16:46.005
AND GRAVITY AND HOW OBJECTS
ARE ATTRACTED TO EACH OTHER.

16:46.039 --> 16:48.608
YEAH, MAYBE AT SCHOOL SOMETIME.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.610
BECKETT, WAIT.

16:50.643 --> 16:56.216
I WAS GONNA ASK YOU
IF YOU MAYBE WANTED

16:56.249 --> 16:59.018
TO GO OUT WITH ME SATURDAY,
LIKE ON A REAL DATE?

16:59.052 --> 17:02.322
GEE, I'M SORRY. I'VE
GOT OTHER PLANS.

17:02.355 --> 17:06.193
BUT... BUT YOU CAN'T
TURN ME DOWN!

17:06.226 --> 17:10.163
I'M ME AND YOU'RE... YOU.

17:10.197 --> 17:14.234
LOOK, PEOPLE SAW YOU TALKING
TO ME IN THE HALL AFTER CLASS

17:14.267 --> 17:18.371
AND I GUESS THEY FIGURED IF A GIRL AS
CUTE AS YOU WOULD TALK TO ME, WELL...

17:18.405 --> 17:21.741
ANYHOW, FELICIA WALLACE ASKED
ME OUT AND I SAID SURE.

17:21.774 --> 17:24.111
FELICIA WALLACE?

17:24.144 --> 17:26.279
SHE'S A SLUT.

17:26.313 --> 17:28.748
THAT'S WHAT THEY TELL ME.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.221
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:34.254 --> 17:38.158
- HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN?
- OH HONEY, I'M SO SORRY.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.593
BUT LOOK AT IT THIS WAY:
YOU ARE A VERY SMART

17:40.627 --> 17:42.629
ATTRACTIVE AND
INTERESTING GIRL, OKAY?

17:42.662 --> 17:44.297
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
THE OPPORTUNITY

17:44.331 --> 17:48.101
TO DUMP MANY MANY GUYS
IN YOUR LIFETIME.

17:48.135 --> 17:51.638
BUT THIS MIGHT BE BECKETT'S
ONLY SHOT AT BEING THE DUMPER.

17:51.671 --> 17:55.208
SO I GUESS I GAVE HIM
AN INCREDIBLE GIFT.

17:56.143 --> 17:57.610
YOU DID.

17:57.644 --> 18:00.213
YOU ARE A GIVER.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.484
AWESOME, EXCITING,
WONDERFUL NEWS.

18:04.517 --> 18:07.086
WE JUST GOT OUR FIRST CHECK
FROM NICK'S SPORTING GOODS.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.289
LOOK, IT'S MADE OUT TO
JOEKNOWSFINANCE.COM.

18:09.322 --> 18:13.193
AW! I FEEL LIKE MY LITTLE BABY
JUST TOOK HER FIRST STEPS.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.128
WHY IS MY WEBSITE A GIRL?

18:15.162 --> 18:17.130
IT JUST IS.

18:17.164 --> 18:19.266
HERE, RELISH THE SWEET
SMELL OF SUCCESS.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.434
IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I
DRIPPED SOME RELISH ON IT

18:21.468 --> 18:23.370
- AND IT SMELLS LIKE...
- HEY, MEL, DO YOU MIND?

18:23.403 --> 18:25.238
I HAVE TO GET A LEG
OF LAMB IN THE OVEN

18:25.272 --> 18:27.674
- AND WE NEED TO KEEP THINGS ON SCHEDULE IN HERE.
- SORRY, OF COURSE.

18:27.707 --> 18:30.443
YOU'RE MAKING WITH THE CAPITALISM,
ROCKIN' THE ENTREPRENEURIAL WORLD,

18:30.477 --> 18:32.579
ON YOUR WAY TO
CREATING AN EMPIRE!

18:32.612 --> 18:34.414
ALL THANKS TO LITTLE OLD ME.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.850
ALL RIGHT, RYDER, LET'S
GET READY TO DO THIS.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.187
FULL SQUAT LIFTS, TAKE ONE.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.255
AHEM.

18:42.289 --> 18:45.258
HEY, I'M JOE LONGO HERE
WITH THE LIFT OF THE WEEK.

18:45.292 --> 18:48.428
THE SQUAT LIFT WILL TONE UP THE
GREATEST NUMBER OF MUSCLES

18:48.461 --> 18:51.598
IN THE FEWEST MOVES.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.201
ONE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER

18:54.234 --> 18:56.236
IS STRETCH FIRST.

18:56.269 --> 19:00.373
YOU WANNA BE GENTLE WITH YOUR...
GROIN.

19:06.613 --> 19:09.316
- JOE?
- MEL. HEY, I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.451
- AND I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.
- WE FOUND EACH OTHER.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.221
YEAH, LISTEN. I JUST... I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT "JOE KNOWS."

19:14.254 --> 19:16.155
- ACTUALLY...
- NO PLEASE, LET ME.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.591
- WELL...
- I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT THE WEBCAST,

19:18.625 --> 19:21.394
AND THE ONLY REASON I
WANTED TO LEND YOU...

19:21.428 --> 19:24.364
SORRY, INVEST THE MONEY...
WAS SO THAT YOU COULD START

19:24.397 --> 19:26.199
YOUR OWN BUSINESS AND BE HAPPY.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.835
BUT WATCHING YOU A LITTLE WHILE AGO...
YOU WEREN'T HAPPY.

19:28.868 --> 19:31.271
- I KNOW. CAN I...
- NO, I'M ALMOST FINISHED.

19:31.304 --> 19:34.341
JOE, I JUST CARE ABOUT YOU
TOO MUCH TO LET YOU DO THIS.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.343
SO JUST DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE MONEY.

19:36.376 --> 19:37.844
PAY ME BACK WHEN YOU CAN.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.847
BUT PLEASE STOP DOING THE
BODY-BUILDING WEBCASTS.

19:40.880 --> 19:45.184
I STOPPED DOING THE
BODY-BUILDING WEBCASTS.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.787
WITHOUT TELLING YOUR PARTNER?

19:47.820 --> 19:50.623
- WHAT'S THIS?
- SWEET VICTORY.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.359
I MADE A DEAL WITH
NICK'S SPORTING GOODS.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.494
I SOLD HIM THE "JOE
KNOWS" SITE OUTRIGHT.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.162
I EVEN MADE A TIDY
LITTLE PROFIT.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.198
- OH, $5,002.
- YES!

19:59.232 --> 20:01.601
JOE LONGO ALWAYS MAKES
HIS INVESTORS MONEY.

20:01.634 --> 20:04.604
THANKS. I CAN RIDE THE BUS NOW.

20:04.637 --> 20:05.905
ALMOST.

20:05.938 --> 20:09.609
SO NO REGRETS ABOUT
SELLING OUR...

20:09.642 --> 20:11.644
- YOUR... THE BUSINESS?
- NAH.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.646
LOOK, I COULD HAVE MADE
THE FITNESS THING WORK,

20:13.680 --> 20:16.182
BUT IT'S NOT WHAT I WANT TO DO.
MY HEART JUST WASN'T IN IT.

20:16.215 --> 20:19.185
I AM GOING TO BE BACK ON TOP IN THE
FINANCIAL WORLD. I PROMISE YOU THAT.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.687
BUT HEY, IT WAS A PLEASURE

20:20.720 --> 20:22.355
DOING BUSINESS
WITH YOU, PARTNER.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.924
- ( chuckling ) NO, IT WASN'T.
- NO, IT REALLY WASN'T.

20:24.957 --> 20:27.560
IT WAS WORSE THAN FRATERNITY
HAZING AT BALL STATE.

20:27.594 --> 20:30.797
YEAH, I'VE HAD BOUTS OF FOOD
POISONING MORE ENJOYABLE.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.632
WE JUST DON'T SEE EYE TO EYE.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.867
Both: WE RUB EACH
OTHER THE WRONG WAY.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.370
- THAT'S WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY!
- I WAS JUST GONNA SAY THAT!

20:37.404 --> 20:40.373
- PARTNERS!
- ( both laugh )

20:40.407 --> 20:42.609
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M
GONNA GO TO THE GARAGE

20:42.642 --> 20:43.910
AND BREAK DOWN THE
REST OF THE SET.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.512
I HAVE AN IDEA ABOUT
HOW TO DO THAT.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.213
NO NO NO NO. DON'T
START WITH THE IDEAS.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.515
- I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
- NO NO NO...

20:48.548 --> 20:50.983
I'M THE ONE WHO PUT IT UP.
I'M GONNA BE TAKING IT DOWN.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.828
OKAY, EVERYTHING'S SET.

21:01.861 --> 21:04.597
AND ACTION!

21:04.631 --> 21:06.866
Want your friends to be jealous

21:06.899 --> 21:09.769
of the huge pile of money
you're sitting on?

21:09.802 --> 21:12.905
Well then, you need Joe Longo's
amazingly wonderful book.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.442

also get a free trip

21:15.475 --> 21:17.444

21:19.879 --> 21:22.715
London,

21:22.749 --> 21:24.884
Egypt,

21:24.917 --> 21:28.287
inside the human heart.

21:28.321 --> 21:30.523
HEY, BURKE, YOU GONNA HELP
ME WITH ANY OF THIS STUFF

21:30.557 --> 21:33.793
- OR ARE YOU JUST GONNA CONTINUE TO PLAY?
- NO, I STILL WANNA PLAY.

21:33.826 --> 21:36.929

you the secrets of finance,

21:36.963 --> 21:40.867
it'll teach you how to fly.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.034
Joe: BURKE.

21:43.536 --> 21:45.304

21:47.340 --> 21:49.342
