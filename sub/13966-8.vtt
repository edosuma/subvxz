03:09.481 --> 03:10.858
Where were you?

03:14.444 --> 03:16.613
I was trying to get to you.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.365
Ever since I was taken away.

03:19.407 --> 03:20.784
But where were you?

03:22.870 --> 03:24.162
I was in Cambulac.

03:25.122 --> 03:29.001
Always watching.
Always close to you.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.753
All this time?

03:32.254 --> 03:33.630
Yes.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.507
What were you doing?

03:36.967 --> 03:38.844
I was made to dance...

03:38.927 --> 03:40.470
for the Khan.

03:40.553 --> 03:43.181
I know what that means now.

03:56.945 --> 03:59.239
I've seen many things.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.241
Met many wives...

04:01.324 --> 04:02.575
many concubines...

04:02.659 --> 04:04.452
of the prince...

04:05.537 --> 04:07.080
of the Khan.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.459
I wanted to tell you myself.

04:13.295 --> 04:14.797
When the time was right...

04:15.964 --> 04:18.425
I wanted to explain it to you.

04:20.803 --> 04:24.139
You've grown...
in such a short time.

04:26.724 --> 04:29.602
I'm meant to be a wife to a prince
all my own.

04:31.146 --> 04:33.774
You're meant to be wife
to the man you love.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.319
Did you love my father?

04:38.653 --> 04:39.863
It's not so simple.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.239
Tell me.

04:43.575 --> 04:44.993
I didn't love him.

But he gave me you,
and I love you.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.444
If anyone can ferret out
a whore and a little girl,

05:19.527 --> 05:20.946
it's that fucking ching-ching.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.409
Wait.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.082
Jingim?

05:33.250 --> 05:35.793
They have not checked in
at way station or checkpoint.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.797
What will you tell the Khan?

05:42.842 --> 05:45.803
AHMAD: The counter-raids
are a resounding success.

05:45.888 --> 05:48.098
Jingim does us proud once again.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.892
My son.

05:49.975 --> 05:52.060
AHMAD: Kaidu will think twice
about further treason.

05:52.144 --> 05:54.938
No, he won't.
Which is why we must get ahead of him.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.149
Forget the rebellion in the south.

05:58.150 --> 06:01.028
I want my army close by my side
as soon as possible.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.572
Sire. One small thing.

06:06.824 --> 06:08.326
The Chancellor's sister.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.495
She's gone missing.

06:11.121 --> 06:12.205
How?

06:12.289 --> 06:14.832
We are, at this very moment,
giving chase.

06:14.917 --> 06:17.002
That's not what I asked.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.256
She gained access
to her daughter, and...

06:22.549 --> 06:24.342
she ran.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.219
You brought her here?

06:27.554 --> 06:30.057
She was supposed to stay in Cambulac.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.766
Chabi's orders.

06:33.851 --> 06:35.353
Does she know?

06:37.814 --> 06:41.276
I wish you wouldn't have told me that.
And now I'm in collusion with you.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.696
Why run?

06:46.114 --> 06:48.116
A whore's thinking does not make itself

06:48.200 --> 06:50.493
readily available
to the lay-person's imaginings.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.162
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

06:55.165 --> 06:57.042
Perhaps that's just me.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.337
We will find her.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.343
Do you have affection for her?

07:08.011 --> 07:09.429
Affection?

07:10.430 --> 07:12.807
(SCOFFS) She's a whore.

07:12.890 --> 07:14.309
One among many.

07:15.435 --> 07:19.356
(CHUCKLES) But she's the only one
that resides under your roof.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.692
Well, the circumstances
of her arrival in Cambulac

07:22.775 --> 07:24.486
required special attention.

07:26.654 --> 07:29.992
Circumstances required
she be executed for her crimes.

07:30.908 --> 07:34.579
A sentence that should've been meted out
the moment she returned with that boy.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.709
Lie to me once, shame upon you.

07:40.793 --> 07:44.839
Lie to me twice, shame upon me.

In another time...

07:53.681 --> 07:57.102
under any other circumstances...

07:59.146 --> 08:01.439
I might have made her a wife.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.863
I used her in ways
that probably didn't sit well with you.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.659
I own nothing in this life.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.248
Nothing which you cannot take from me,
whenever you wish.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.003
You'll find her.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.841
Until then, let's...
keep this our little secret, huh?

08:41.188 --> 08:43.815
Do you want to eat dinner
with me tonight?

08:45.692 --> 08:48.320
I've been dining alone
quite a bit lately.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.324
Certainly, Sire.

She tied you up, not me.

What do you mean, "gone"?

10:37.845 --> 10:39.639
As I was saying.

10:39.722 --> 10:40.890
A betrayal, for certain.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.475
Betrayal by who?

10:42.559 --> 10:45.520
Polo wouldn't leave.
Something's happened to him.

10:47.397 --> 10:50.442
- You blame us?
- By process of elimination.

10:50.525 --> 10:52.402
What possible rationale could we have

10:52.485 --> 10:55.322
to drag an entire Crusade army
all this distance

10:55.405 --> 10:57.949
only to turn on them now,
when we need them the most?

10:58.032 --> 11:01.369
I've long questioned how your minds work,
or even if you have them.

11:04.414 --> 11:08.668
I am a prince, General,
on a mission from our Pope.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.003
Assigned by His Holiness directly.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.423
You will address me as such.

11:13.506 --> 11:17.469
If we do not find him alive and well,
you will be blamed, and then slaughtered.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.888
Good day, Prince Mongol.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.691
You swore for the Latin.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.901
You vouched for Polo.

11:35.027 --> 11:37.029
He didn't leave us here.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.823
Not willingly, at least.

11:47.249 --> 11:48.791
They're looking for me.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.171

11:55.089 --> 11:58.009

When do you attack?

12:01.429 --> 12:04.140

- Are you his bastard?

12:16.403 --> 12:17.862

Does it make him less of a man?

(GASPING)

36:37.696 --> 36:39.030
(SHUDDERS)

36:39.114 --> 36:41.074
He made me kill the boy.

36:55.130 --> 36:58.591
JINGIM: Kaidu's army has set camp
deep within Nayan's land.

36:58.674 --> 37:01.720
KUBLAI: At pace, we're
a half a day's ride to the twin rivers.

37:01.803 --> 37:03.054
Yes, Father.

37:04.097 --> 37:05.974
How many men do they have?

37:06.057 --> 37:08.018
Tens of thousands.

37:08.101 --> 37:10.812
And hundreds of barrels
of your black powder.

37:10.896 --> 37:13.523
With Ahmad having sent
most of our army south...

37:15.817 --> 37:17.861
we're heavily outnumbered.

37:24.367 --> 37:26.369
We're going to have to improvise.

37:37.422 --> 37:39.049
MEI LIN: I have to go back.

37:41.802 --> 37:43.762
LOTUS: I thought you'd say that.

37:44.930 --> 37:47.766
MEI LIN: You're right.
They'll keep coming.

37:48.934 --> 37:50.769
I have to finish this.

37:53.021 --> 37:54.773
What are you going to tell her?

38:01.947 --> 38:04.908
(SIGHS) You're not going to tell her.

38:06.492 --> 38:09.871
I don't have the strength to look her
in the eye and leave once again.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.086
Keep her safe?

38:17.087 --> 38:19.464
I will not be ward to another child.

38:25.636 --> 38:26.847
(KISSES)

38:28.389 --> 38:30.600
MEI LIN: I lied to you.

38:31.601 --> 38:34.813
I knew we were bringing the Boy Emperor
back to his death.

38:36.857 --> 38:38.649
And still I stole him from you.

38:39.734 --> 38:42.195
His death is on my conscience.

38:42.278 --> 38:43.696
Not yours.

38:50.286 --> 38:52.372
What do you want me to tell her?

39:04.009 --> 39:05.760
I found her this time.

39:08.679 --> 39:10.556
I will find her again.

39:11.975 --> 39:13.894
And then it will be forever.

39:27.532 --> 39:28.616
(KISSES)

39:53.808 --> 39:56.561
- (JINGIM KISSING)
- (KOKACHIN CHUCKLES)

39:56.644 --> 39:59.397
JINGIM: A kiss for every wife
our son will take.

40:02.775 --> 40:05.153
I can feel him kicking!
(LAUGHS)

40:06.321 --> 40:07.822
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

40:11.659 --> 40:12.994
CHABI: Jingim.

40:16.915 --> 40:17.999
(JINGIM CLEARS THROAT)

40:18.083 --> 40:19.918
Your father is waiting.

40:21.627 --> 40:23.004
Yes, Mother.

40:26.549 --> 40:28.176
I love you, wife.

40:30.553 --> 40:31.972
I love you, son.

40:33.056 --> 40:34.474
(SIGHS)

40:39.938 --> 40:41.606
(KOKACHIN INHALES SHARPLY)

40:42.690 --> 40:44.775
Be safe, my love.

40:45.693 --> 40:47.028
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

41:03.169 --> 41:05.255
(CHABI BREATHES DEEPLY)

41:05.338 --> 41:06.965
Listen to your wife.

41:10.301 --> 41:11.552
(SIGHS)

41:30.405 --> 41:32.948
Thank you, Mother,
for letting me see him.

41:35.868 --> 41:37.328
No.

41:42.125 --> 41:44.419
But you've seemed so well, child.

41:46.462 --> 41:48.006
I am not.

41:51.634 --> 41:53.178
She is here.

41:54.887 --> 41:56.639
Always.

42:23.249 --> 42:24.250
(SIGHS)

42:25.168 --> 42:27.295
(SIGHS)

42:34.885 --> 42:36.554
MARCO: <i>There was this girl.</i>

42:36.637 --> 42:40.516
<i>I used to make deliveries to her family
along the canals.</i>

42:41.851 --> 42:43.811
<i>Once a week, same time.</i>

42:46.231 --> 42:49.817
<i>She would come to the balcony...
smile down at me.</i>

42:51.652 --> 42:53.363
<i>She'd lower her basket,</i>

42:53.446 --> 42:54.822
<i>and I'd fill it.</i>

42:57.825 --> 42:59.452
<i>She'd pull it up.</i>

42:59.535 --> 43:02.705
<i>And as I pushed off the wall...</i>

43:02.788 --> 43:04.874
<i>each time, she'd say...</i>

43:04.957 --> 43:06.834
<i>"Until next week."</i>

43:06.917 --> 43:08.253
(MARCO CHUCKLES)

43:11.839 --> 43:13.716
I wonder if she's still there.

43:16.177 --> 43:19.305
NICCOLÒ: You can't go back.
It's too late for that.

43:22.392 --> 43:26.937
Even if one day you do return to Venice,
nothing will ever be as it was for you.

43:28.981 --> 43:32.402
Where are you attacking? When?

43:33.778 --> 43:36.739
My army stands ready.
Just in case.

43:36.822 --> 43:38.408
In case what?

43:38.491 --> 43:41.869
Kublai loses the election
and refuses to concede.

43:41.952 --> 43:43.829
And if he does concede?

43:51.003 --> 43:52.505
Exterminated.

43:52.588 --> 43:55.133
The Mongols don't go away
with Kaidu's victory.

43:55.216 --> 43:56.426
Very good.

43:57.302 --> 43:59.137
So you'll destroy Kaidu as well?

43:59.220 --> 44:01.597
And anyone who ascends
to the throne after him.

44:02.682 --> 44:06.394
The Mongols are destined to be little more
than a vague memory in history.

44:07.728 --> 44:09.689
Whereas you?

44:09.772 --> 44:14.402
You could be hailed as a hero
for generations to come.

44:14.485 --> 44:17.029
Dressed in chainmail
and a Crusader cross?

44:17.112 --> 44:18.448
Why not?

44:18.531 --> 44:20.200
This is God's will, Marco.

44:20.283 --> 44:22.702
What are the chances
we'd find each other here

44:22.785 --> 44:24.412
without a divine hand guiding us?

44:24.495 --> 44:27.207
You assembled an army
in the backyard of my Khan.

44:27.290 --> 44:28.541
Your Khan?

44:31.169 --> 44:32.545
Such loyalty.

44:32.628 --> 44:34.964
Until a time of his choosing,
and then...

44:35.965 --> 44:38.343
he'll grind your bones to dust.

44:38.926 --> 44:40.261
(CHUCKLES)

44:41.887 --> 44:44.098
I know it's hard for you to believe...

44:46.601 --> 44:49.144
but should you change your mind...

44:50.938 --> 44:52.315
come and find me.

45:03.451 --> 45:05.453
You speak as though
I'm letting you go.

45:07.872 --> 45:09.415
I cannot.

45:09.499 --> 45:10.625
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)

45:11.959 --> 45:13.168
Marco!

45:26.516 --> 45:28.142
