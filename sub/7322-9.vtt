HE MIGHT AS WELL

05:15.015 --> 05:17.087
HAVE JUST SAID OLD AGE.
IT'S POSSIBLE.

05:17.087 --> 05:19.089
HE'S 67. AND IF HE FELL

AN INTRACRANIAL BLEED,

05:21.091 --> 05:23.554

A NEW CARDIO ATTENDING,

09:22.032 --> 09:24.665
AND YOUR WIFE
IS HERE TO SEE YOU.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.136
WHAT?

09:26.136 --> 09:29.600
YOU IN TROUBLE.
DRINK YOUR LATTE.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.241
HE NEEDS A SPINAL TAP.

09:31.241 --> 09:33.243
HE'S FALLEN AND COULD'VE
BURST AN ANEURYSM,

09:33.243 --> 09:35.746
AND SOME BLEEDS SHOW UP
ON A SPINAL TAP

09:35.746 --> 09:38.048
THAT DON'T ON A C.T.
AND SOME DOCTORS
ENJOY TORTURING PATIENTS

09:38.048 --> 09:40.050
BECAUSE THEY'VE MESSED UP
AND DON'T KNOW

09:40.050 --> 09:42.783
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO
WITH THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.955
YOU ARE THE ONE
THAT GOT ME FIRED.

09:44.955 --> 09:47.958
YOU OWE ME THIS,
YOU LITTLE BITCH.

09:47.958 --> 09:49.960
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU WANT ME TO FIND

09:49.960 --> 09:51.792
THAT SNOTTY
REED WHAT'S HER NAME

09:51.792 --> 09:55.696
AND TELL HER HOW MUCH YOU
LOVE HER, 'CAUSE I WILL.

09:58.028 --> 10:00.631
SICK SINUS SYNDROME.

10:00.631 --> 10:03.173
(Cristina) SHE NEEDS A TEMPORARY
TRANSVENOUS PACEMAKER NOW.
DR. YANG, DO YOU WANT
TO TAKE THIS ONE?

10:03.173 --> 10:05.806
I HAVEN'T DONE ONE OF THESE
IN TEN YEARS.
EXCUSE ME?

10:05.806 --> 10:08.779
I DO.
GREAT, IT'S ALL YOURS.

10:08.779 --> 10:11.241
WAIT. UH, YOU DON'T
REMEMBER HOW TO OR--
I'VE BEEN WORKING PRIMARILY
ON SOLDIERS, DR. YANG,

10:11.241 --> 10:13.984
MOST OF WHOM ARE WELL UNDER
THE AGE OF 70.

10:13.984 --> 10:16.046
(Owen) USE THE RIGHT I.J.,
DR. AVERY.

10:16.046 --> 10:18.018
IT'LL GIVE YOU
THE MOST DIRECT APPROACH.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.250
(mouths word)

10:20.250 --> 10:23.994
DR. ALTMAN, WILL YOU
EXCUSE ME JUST FOR A MOMENT?

10:23.994 --> 10:27.627
I-I JUST NEED TO TALK
TO THE CHIEF ABOUT SOMETHING.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.399
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

10:29.399 --> 10:32.102
(clicking)

10:32.102 --> 10:33.964
(beep)

10:33.964 --> 10:38.138
SHE HAS BEEN STAYING
WITH HER MOM IN CHEHALIS.

10:38.138 --> 10:41.141
DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
SHE'S STAYING, IF SHE'S STAYING.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.143
SHE HAS BEEN KEEPING UP
WITH HER I.L.-2.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.275
THAT MUCH I DO KNOW.

10:45.275 --> 10:48.148
(computer beeps)

10:48.148 --> 10:51.181
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

10:51.181 --> 10:54.424
(scanner thumping)

10:59.089 --> 11:02.362
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

11:02.362 --> 11:05.065
I WAS UP TILL ALL HOURS
WORKING ON THE BUDGET.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.367
AND BY THE TIME YOU REALIZED
WHAT TIME IT WAS,

11:07.367 --> 11:09.369
IT WAS TOO LATE TO CALL
AND LET ADELE KNOW

11:09.369 --> 11:11.341
YOU WERE GOING TO SLEEP HERE,

11:11.341 --> 11:14.344
WHICH IS WHAT I WILL TELL HER
WHILE YOU'RE IN SURGERY.
OH, THANK YOU, BAILEY.

11:14.344 --> 11:17.347
CHIEF.
NOW IS NOT THE TIME, YANG.
THE CHIEF HAS EMERGENCY SURGERY.

11:17.347 --> 11:19.349
THE CHIEF HAS AN EMERGENCY
CARDIO SITUATION.

11:19.349 --> 11:21.351
THE NEW ATTENDING DOESN'T EVEN
KNOW HOW TO PUT IN

11:21.351 --> 11:23.213
A TEMPORARY PACEMAKER.
YANG--

11:23.213 --> 11:26.717
DO NOT ENGAGE. DID YOU
OR DID YOU NOT ASK THIS MAN

11:26.717 --> 11:29.119
FOR A NEW CARDIO ATTENDING?
YES, BUT--

11:29.119 --> 11:32.222
AND DID HE OR DID HE NOT BRING
IN ATTENDING AFTER ATTENDING,

11:32.222 --> 11:35.225
NONE OF WHOM SEEM TO PLEASE YOU
AND ALL OF WHOM YOU RAN OFF?

11:35.225 --> 11:37.728
THAT IS NOT
A FAIR ASSESSMENT.
DR. YANG, HAS IT EVER
OCCURRED TO YOU

11:37.728 --> 11:40.871
THAT YOU MIGHT BE THE PROBLEM?

11:40.871 --> 11:43.974
R-RIGHT. LEAVE THIS MAN ALONE.
GO TORTURE THE NEW ATTENDING.

11:43.974 --> 11:46.206
SIR--
YANG, DO AS BAILEY SAYS.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.078
(elevator bell dings)

11:48.078 --> 11:50.811
AND YOU ARE DUE IN SURGERY.

11:50.811 --> 11:53.784
BAILEY, WHAT WOULD I DO
WITHOUT YOU?

11:53.784 --> 11:56.146
LET'S HOPE YOU NEVER
HAVE TO FIND OUT.

11:56.146 --> 11:59.950
HEY, IS YOUR TRAUMA PATIENT
STABLE FOR SKIN GRAFTING?
THE ONE WITH
THE PANCREATIC DUCT RUPTURE.

11:59.950 --> 12:02.052
(Adele) MIRANDA.
OH, ADELE.

12:02.052 --> 12:05.996
OH, I'M SO SORRY. I SENT
THE CHIEF INTO SURGERY.

12:05.996 --> 12:08.098
DO YOU WANT ME TO--
WHAT I WANT

12:08.098 --> 12:10.400
IS FOR YOU TO TELL ME
THE TRUTH.

12:10.400 --> 12:13.804
ARE YOU HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH MY HUSBAND?

12:29.479 --> 12:34.124
I--I AM NOT HAVING
AN AFFAIR WITH YOUR HUSBAND.

12:34.124 --> 12:37.357
I SAW THE WAY
YOU HANDLED HIM JUST NOW.

12:37.357 --> 12:40.330
(laughing) I DID NOT
HANDLE HIM. I J--

12:40.330 --> 12:43.263
THERE WAS NO HANDLE--
WE WORK TOGETHER.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.265
YOU SPEND
EVERY WAKING MOMENT TOGETHER.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.137
YOU FINISH
EACH OTHER'S SENTENCES.

12:47.137 --> 12:49.139
YOU READ EACH OTHER'S MINDS.

12:49.139 --> 12:51.141
YOU'RE MORE MARRIED
TO THAT MAN THAN I AM.

12:51.141 --> 12:54.204
YEAH, BUT THAT'S JUST BECAUSE
THEY'RE HUSBAND AND WORK-WIFE.

12:54.204 --> 12:57.177
EXCUSE ME?
THE CHIEF'S YOUR WORK-HUSBAND,
AND YOU'RE HIS WORK-WIFE.

12:57.177 --> 13:00.881
YOU LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER.
YOU TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER.

13:00.881 --> 13:03.413
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.
IT'S LIKE ME AND SLOAN.
EXCUSE ME?

13:03.413 --> 13:06.356
NOBODY'S TALKING TO YOU.
HE'S MY WORK-HUSBAND,

13:06.356 --> 13:09.219
BUT HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND,
AND I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND,

13:09.219 --> 13:12.262
BUT THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON
BETWEEN US.
I MEAN, THERE WAS
AT ONE POINT--

13:12.262 --> 13:15.025
YOU'RE NOT HELPING.
NEITHER ONE OF YOU
ARE HELPING.

13:15.025 --> 13:18.268
ADELE, I PROMISE YOU,
THERE IS NOTHING GOING ON.
SOMETHING IS GOING ON,

13:18.268 --> 13:21.401
BECAUSE HE HASN'T BEEN
IN HIS BED ALL WEEK.
WHAT?

13:21.401 --> 13:22.903
REALLY?

13:22.903 --> 13:25.235
THE LAST TIME HE ACTED
LIKE THIS--DISAPPEARING,

13:25.235 --> 13:27.377
SLEEPING AT THE HOSPITAL
EVERY NIGHT--

13:27.377 --> 13:29.079
HE WAS WITH ELLIS GREY.

13:29.079 --> 13:31.541
HE MAY NOT BE HAVING
AN AFFAIR WITH YOU--

13:31.541 --> 13:35.085
HE'S NOT. I PROMISE YOU.
I PROMISE YOU, HE'S NOT.

13:36.586 --> 13:39.089
(elevator bell dings)

13:39.089 --> 13:40.350
OKAY.

13:40.350 --> 13:43.223
BUT WIFE-WIFE TO WORK-WIFE,

13:43.223 --> 13:49.099
SOMEONE IS THIS HOSPITAL
IS SLEEPING WITH OUR HUSBAND.

13:49.099 --> 13:51.061
(cell phone beeps)

13:54.865 --> 13:57.868
(monitor beeping rhythmically)
HOW ARE WE DOING, DR. YANG?

13:57.868 --> 14:01.171
GARY CLARK, 57, S.T. ELEVATION
IN LEADS 1 THROUGH 4.

14:01.171 --> 14:03.413
WHICH WOULD INDICATE?
ANTERIOR HEART ATTACK.

14:03.413 --> 14:06.276
PROBABLY A BLOCKAGE
IN THE L.A.D.

14:06.276 --> 14:09.179
HE'S READY FOR AN ANGIOPLASTY.
ALL RIGHT. TALK ME
THROUGH THE PROCEDURE.

14:09.179 --> 14:12.122
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
REMEMBER HOW?
NO, THAT WAS ACTUALLY
A TEACHING MOMENT.

14:12.122 --> 14:14.124
ACCESS THE FEMORAL ARTERY,

14:14.124 --> 14:16.126
THREAD THE CATHETER
TO THE HEART,

14:16.126 --> 14:18.128
INJECT DYE,
THEN OPEN UP THE BLOCKAGE.

14:18.128 --> 14:20.860
GOOD. MAKE SURE YOU USE
THE PIGTAIL CATHETER

14:20.860 --> 14:22.862
TO GET A GOOD--
LIKE THIS ONE?

14:22.862 --> 14:24.334
HUH.

14:24.334 --> 14:27.497
LOOK AT THAT. DR. AVERY,
WHAT CAN WE INFER FROM THIS?

14:27.497 --> 14:31.171
HE'S GOT WALL MOTION
ABNORMALITIES.
YES, IN THE LEFT
VENTRICULAR WALL.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.243
OKAY, LET'S GET INTO
THE LEFT CORONARY TREE.

14:33.243 --> 14:35.245
ALREADY THERE.

14:35.245 --> 14:36.376
OH.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.309
O-OKAY, UM... WELL,
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE

14:39.309 --> 14:41.451
THAT YOU GET IMAGES
IN MANY PLANES,

14:41.451 --> 14:44.184
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
SHIFT THE FLUORO--
OH, WELL, WE USE
A ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.186
IT DOES THAT ON ITS OWN.

14:46.186 --> 14:47.988
HUH. LOOK AT THAT.

14:47.988 --> 14:51.191
I GUESS I'M THE ONE
WHO LEARNED SOMETHING TODAY.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.423
YEAH. LOOK AT THAT.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.297
CHIEF.

14:57.297 --> 14:58.398
UH-HUH.

15:01.371 --> 15:04.074
OKAY, I, UH,
I UNDERSTAND, YOU'RE UNDER

15:04.074 --> 15:07.037
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT
OF PRESSURE RIGHT NOW

15:07.037 --> 15:10.981
AND THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO SPEND TIME AT HOME...

15:10.981 --> 15:12.983
AND THAT A MAN
IN YOUR POSITION

15:12.983 --> 15:15.285
HAS CERTAIN...

15:15.285 --> 15:16.947
NEEDS...

15:16.947 --> 15:18.248
(elevator bell dings)

15:18.248 --> 15:20.450
AND THAT, UH, WHEN A MAN

15:20.450 --> 15:24.524
IS AS POWERFUL
AND AS ATTRACTIVE AS YOU ARE,

15:24.524 --> 15:28.098
THOSE NEEDS MIGHT EASILY
BE MET BY--

15:28.098 --> 15:30.060
DR. BAILEY.
YEAH, SIR.

15:30.060 --> 15:31.962
ARE YOU HITTING ON ME?

15:31.962 --> 15:33.964
YOUR WIFE
JUST SHOWED UP HERE

15:33.964 --> 15:36.536
ASKING ME IF YOU AND I
WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR.

15:36.536 --> 15:39.509
WELL, YOU KNOW--
I-I DON'T WANT TO KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING.

15:39.509 --> 15:42.212
WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR BUSINESS
IS YOUR BUSINESS.

15:42.212 --> 15:46.046
AND I WAS NOT
HITTING ON YOU.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.947
UNDERSTOOD.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.349
MM-HMM.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.051
(scoffs)

15:54.424 --> 15:57.257
DR. PERCY IS ALMOST DONE

15:57.257 --> 15:59.689
GETTING THE SPINAL FLUID
SAMPLE HE NEEDS.

15:59.689 --> 16:02.632
YEAH, NOT THAT I HAD
ANY CHOICE.
THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

16:02.632 --> 16:05.435
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.
HE'S ALMOST DONE.
SO WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU AND KAREV?

16:05.435 --> 16:07.537
HAVE YOU EVEN TALKED TO HIM?

16:07.537 --> 16:09.639
HOW IS THAT
ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS?

16:09.639 --> 16:11.201
IT'S EVERYBODY'S BUSINESS.

16:11.201 --> 16:13.443
IT'S ALL ANYBODY
TALKS ABOUT AROUND HERE.

16:13.443 --> 16:17.077
STEVENS AND KAREV--HAVE THEY
TALKED, ARE THEY TALKING?

16:17.077 --> 16:18.448
SO ARE YOU?

16:21.181 --> 16:23.053
THAT'S IT. YOU'RE ALL DONE.

16:23.053 --> 16:25.515
JUST NEED YOU TO LIE FLAT
FOR A WHILE, OKAY?
(exhales)

16:25.515 --> 16:29.359
SEE? THAT WASN'T SO BAD,
WAS IT?
SO THIS KAREV...

16:29.359 --> 16:31.761
HE'S THE BOY, THE ONE
WHO GOT YOU IN TROUBLE?

16:31.761 --> 16:34.064
WELL, HE DIDN'T
HELP MATTERS MUCH.

16:34.064 --> 16:36.366
DID HE PROPOSE?
(chuckles)

16:36.366 --> 16:38.128
WELL, WHATEVER YOU DO,

16:38.128 --> 16:40.130
DON'T MARRY HIM,
BECAUSE IF YOU DO

16:40.130 --> 16:43.173
AND YOU HAVE THIS CHILD,
YOU'LL NEVER BECOME A SURGEON.

16:43.173 --> 16:46.476
YOU'LL PROBABLY NEVER EVEN
MAKE IT OUT OF CHEHALIS.

16:46.476 --> 16:49.479
WHAT YOU WILL DO, THOUGH,
IS YOU'LL END UP ANGRY

16:49.479 --> 16:53.213
AND FRUSTRATED AND, UH...
(exhales) ALONE.

16:56.446 --> 16:58.688
YOU GOTTA DO
WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

16:58.688 --> 17:02.622
AND IF THIS BOY REALLY CARES
FOR YOU, HE'LL UNDERSTAND.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.406
HOW'D YOU FIND ME HERE?

17:16.406 --> 17:18.108
THE NURSES LOVE ME.

17:18.108 --> 17:20.110
(laughs)
THEY'RE MY SPIES,
AND THEY'RE PISSED

17:20.110 --> 17:22.112
THAT YOU'RE DESTERILIZING
ALL THEIR EQUIPMENT.

17:22.112 --> 17:24.114
WHAT ELSE
WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

17:24.114 --> 17:27.177
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET
ON A SURGERY ALL DAY.

17:27.177 --> 17:30.580
BEFORE I LEFT, THERE WERE
FIVE PEOPLE TO COMPETE WITH,

17:30.580 --> 17:33.523
AND NOW THERE ARE 25.
YOU'LL GET IN THE O.R.
SOON ENOUGH.

17:33.523 --> 17:36.526
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A MOMENT
FOR, LIKE FIVE SECONDS...
MM-HMM.

17:36.526 --> 17:38.528
WHEN HIT-BY-A-BUS GUY
WASN'T GEORGE

17:38.528 --> 17:41.691
AND IZZIE HAD JUST
COME THROUGH SURGERY...

17:41.691 --> 17:44.294
YOU AND I HAD JUST DONE
OUR POST-IT...

17:44.294 --> 17:47.537
MM-HMM.
IT WAS, LIKE, FIVE SECONDS,
WHEN EVERYBODY WAS HAPPY.

17:47.537 --> 17:50.470
I KEEP CLOSING MY EYES
TRYING TO GET BACK TO THAT.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.172
HERE. TURN AROUND.

17:54.204 --> 17:56.206
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

18:01.211 --> 18:03.283
ONE...

18:03.283 --> 18:05.485
TWO...

18:05.485 --> 18:08.087
THREE...

18:08.087 --> 18:09.419
FOUR...

18:12.862 --> 18:14.524
FIVE.

18:14.524 --> 18:16.226
HOW WAS THAT?

18:16.226 --> 18:17.567
ALMOST PERFECT.

18:17.567 --> 18:20.600
FIVE ALMOST-PERFECT SECONDS.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.203
CALL ME WHEN YOU WANT
FIVE MORE, OKAY?

18:23.203 --> 18:25.205
(laughs)

18:25.205 --> 18:26.876
(door opens)

18:26.876 --> 18:29.439
STEVENS.

18:29.439 --> 18:33.183
RESULTS OF THE SPINAL TAP.

18:33.183 --> 18:35.145
THEY'RE NORMAL.

18:35.145 --> 18:36.446
DAMN IT.

18:36.446 --> 18:40.450
I'M SORRY
FOR WASTING YOUR TIME.

18:40.450 --> 18:42.592
(speaks indistinctly)

18:44.524 --> 18:46.396
DR. SINGER?

18:46.396 --> 18:48.328
ISOBEL?

18:50.360 --> 18:51.861
ISOBEL STEVENS?

18:51.861 --> 18:54.704
OH, MY GOD.
LOOK AT YOU--ALL GROWN UP.

18:54.704 --> 18:56.406
I AM?

18:56.406 --> 18:59.709
WHAT--WHAT AM I DOING HERE?
WHY AM I IN MY PAJAMAS?

18:59.709 --> 19:02.872
IS SOMETHING... IS THERE
SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME, ISOBEL?

19:02.872 --> 19:04.644
HE'S LUCID.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.446
GO PAGE SHEPHERD.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.147
(elevator bell dings)

19:08.147 --> 19:10.149
DR. BAILEY.
DR. BAILEY, DO YOU MIND

19:10.149 --> 19:12.422
IF I SCRUB IN
ON THE CHIEF'S ILEOSTOMY?

19:12.422 --> 19:16.155
YES, I DO MIND. THAT MAN IS
OLD ENOUGH TO BE YOUR FATHER.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.258
DR. BAILEY,
HAVE YOU SEEN THE CHIEF?

19:18.258 --> 19:20.390
NO. UNH-UNH. YOU DON'T NEED
TO BE SEEING THE CHIEF,

19:20.390 --> 19:22.892
EITHER ONE OF YOU.
OKAY, BUT THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG

19:22.892 --> 19:24.794
WITH HIS
EMERGENCY CHOLE PATIENT.

19:24.794 --> 19:27.397
OK--SO YOU TELL ME,
AND I'LL TELL THE CHIEF.

19:27.397 --> 19:29.399
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

19:29.399 --> 19:32.272
HE'S YELLOW.

19:33.803 --> 19:35.205
OH.

19:49.859 --> 19:52.322
THIS IS THE YELLOWEST MAN
THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN.

19:52.322 --> 19:54.193
RIGHT?
HE'S, LIKE, LEMON YELLOW.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.496
LIKE MUSTARD YELLOW.
HEY, HEY, WE GET IT.
HE'S YELLOW.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.598
I'M TRYING
TO FIND OUT WHY.

19:58.598 --> 20:01.301
ULTRASOUND SHOWS...
DILATED DUCTS.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.672
WHICH MEANS
OBSTRUCTIVE JAUNDICE,

20:02.672 --> 20:05.305
BUT THE CHIEF ONLY
TOOK OUT THE GALLBLADDER.

20:05.305 --> 20:08.608
AND WE NEVER SAW ANY SIGNS OF
LIVER DISEASE OR CANCERS, BUT...

20:08.608 --> 20:10.710
COULD THAT MEAN--

20:10.710 --> 20:13.813
THAT THE CHIEF ACCIDENTALLY
CLIPPED THE COMMON BILE DUCT?
OH, MY GOD.

20:13.813 --> 20:17.417
OKAY, OKAY, STOP...
RIGHT NOW, BOTH OF YOU.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.848
NOW DID YOU ACTUALLY SEE

20:18.848 --> 20:22.292
THE CHIEF CLIP
THE COMMON BILE DUCT?
NO, OF COURSE NOT. BUT--

20:22.292 --> 20:24.354
BUT NOTHING. THAT'S ONE OF
THE MOST SERIOUS MISTAKES

20:24.354 --> 20:25.725
A GENERAL SURGEON CAN MAKE,

20:25.725 --> 20:28.258
SO LET'S NOT MAKE
THIS ACCUSATION LIGHTLY.

20:28.258 --> 20:30.400
IT WASN'T AN ACCUSATION--
UH, STOP TALKING.

20:30.400 --> 20:33.433
JUST GET AN E.R.C.P.
TO FIND THE EXACT CAUSE

20:33.433 --> 20:35.935
OF THIS MAN'S DISCOLORATION.

20:38.368 --> 20:40.840
AND, DOCTORS, IF I FIND OUT
THAT EITHER OF YOU

20:40.840 --> 20:43.343
HAS SAID A WORD ABOUT THIS
TO ANYONE,

20:43.343 --> 20:45.345
I WILL MAKE SURE
THAT YOU ARE THE ONES

20:45.345 --> 20:47.517
WHO REQUIRE EMERGENCY SURGERY.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.482
YOU HAVE A CONDITION
CALLED N.P.H.--

20:52.482 --> 20:54.354
NORMAL PRESSURE HYDROCEPHALUS.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.855
(Derek) IT'S A BUILDUP

20:55.855 --> 20:58.288
OF CEREBROSPINAL FLUID
IN YOUR BRAIN.

20:58.288 --> 21:00.460
VERY HARD TO, UH, DIAGNOSE,
BUT THANKS TO DR. PERCY HERE--

21:00.460 --> 21:03.393
THE SPINAL TAP REMOVED
SOME OF THE FLUID,

21:03.393 --> 21:05.795
RELIEVING THE PRESSURE IN YOUR
BRAIN, RESOLVING YOUR SYMPTOMS,

21:05.795 --> 21:08.638
WHICH IS HOW WE CAME
TO YOUR DIAGNOSIS.
HMM.

21:08.638 --> 21:12.402
HMM. DR. SHEPHERD WANTS TO
PUT IN A PERMANENT SHUNT.

21:12.402 --> 21:14.404
IT'LL DRAIN THE EXCESS FLUID
TO YOUR ABDOMEN, SO--

21:14.404 --> 21:16.876
OH, THAT--THAT SOUNDS LIKE
MAJOR SURGERY.
NO.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.878
IT'S 45 MINUTES.
IT'S A VERY COMMON PROCEDURE.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.910
I DO IT ALL THE TIME.

21:20.910 --> 21:24.554
MM-HMM. WELL, I DON'T THINK
I COULD AFFORD IT.

21:24.554 --> 21:27.657
MY SAVINGS, MY RETIREMENT, UH,

21:27.657 --> 21:30.990
IT ALL WENT TO
MY LATE WIFE'S MEDICAL CARE.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.723
SO, UH...

21:33.723 --> 21:35.825
WHAT DO I DO?

21:37.497 --> 21:38.998
DR. SHEPHERD.

21:38.998 --> 21:39.999
STEVENS.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.001
I HATE
TO EVEN ASK THIS OF YOU

21:42.001 --> 21:44.003
AFTER EVERYTHING
YOU'VE DONE FOR ME,

21:44.003 --> 21:46.336
BUT IS THERE ANY WAY
DR. SINGER'S SURGERY

21:46.336 --> 21:47.837
COULD BE PRO BONO?

21:47.837 --> 21:50.440
LOOK, IF YOU GET THE CHIEF
TO SIGN OFF ON THIS,

21:50.440 --> 21:52.412
I'D BE HAPPY
TO DONATE MY TIME.

21:52.412 --> 21:54.644
♪♪

21:54.644 --> 21:56.346
YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S BAILEY?

21:56.346 --> 21:57.447
NO.

21:57.447 --> 21:59.649
REALLY? I KINDA
LIKE THEM TOGETHER.

21:59.649 --> 22:02.722
IT'S NOT YANG, IS IT?
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

22:02.722 --> 22:05.725
OH, YOU HAVEN'T HEARD.
THE CHIEF'S HAVING AN--
MARK, YOU ARE
A TERRIBLE GOSSIP.

22:05.725 --> 22:08.327
I'M AN EXCELLENT GOSSIP.
HEY, MIND IF WE JOIN YOU?

22:08.327 --> 22:10.329
NO, HAVE A SEAT.
MNH-MNH. NOT AT ALL.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.331
HOW'S YOUR FIRST DAY GOING?

22:12.331 --> 22:14.434
YOU READY TO GO BACK
TO BAGHDAD YET?

22:14.434 --> 22:16.406
(laughs) I'M ACTUALLY
REALLY IMPRESSED--

22:16.406 --> 22:18.668
THE FACILITY, THE EQUIPMENT,
THE CALIBER OF THE RESIDENTS.

22:18.668 --> 22:21.641
HAVE YOU MET
CRISTINA YANG YET?
MM. CRISTINA YANG

22:21.641 --> 22:24.644
MAY IN FACT BE THE BEST RESIDENT
I'VE EVER SEEN.

22:24.644 --> 22:26.676
YOU THINK?
(mouth full) YEAH, I DO.

22:26.676 --> 22:29.679
(laughs) I DON'T THINK
SHE LIKES ME, BUT YEAH.
OOH. SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU?

22:29.679 --> 22:32.422
MARK.
NO, YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

22:32.422 --> 22:34.454
JUST BECAUSE YANG DROVE OFF

22:34.454 --> 22:36.986
THE LAST THREE CARDIO ATTENDINGS
DOESN'T MEAN--
SHE DID NOT.

22:36.986 --> 22:39.128
BURKE?
COME ON, THAT WAS--

22:39.128 --> 22:41.991
HAHN?
SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH HAHN LEAVING.

22:41.991 --> 22:43.993
(Callie) NOPE, THAT WAS ME.
(Mark) DIXON?

22:43.993 --> 22:46.796
CRISTINA JUST NEEDS
A STRONG CARDIO ATTENDING,

22:46.796 --> 22:48.798
AND SHE DESERVES
A STRONG CARDIO ATTENDING.

22:48.798 --> 22:50.800
CRISTINA? HUH.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.442
WOW.

22:52.442 --> 22:54.404
SO... (laughs)
SO YOU AND YANG?

22:54.404 --> 22:56.946
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU AND BETH?
(Mark) OH, HE DIDN'T TELL YOU?

22:56.946 --> 22:59.409
BETH SHOWED UP AT THE HOSPITAL
ONE DAY.

22:59.409 --> 23:01.110
SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HE WAS--OW!
(slurps)

23:01.110 --> 23:04.053
DID YOU JUST KICK ME?

23:04.053 --> 23:06.416
(whispers) THAT WAS ME.
(Mark) MM.

23:06.416 --> 23:08.387
SO... WAIT. WAIT.
WHEN YOU CALLED ME UP

23:08.387 --> 23:10.389
AND YOU TOLD ME ABOUT
THIS GREAT JOB

23:10.389 --> 23:11.891
AT THIS GREAT HOSPITAL,

23:11.891 --> 23:13.993
YOU--YOU WERE JUST
BRINGING ME OUT HERE

23:13.993 --> 23:16.566
AS--AS A--AS A PRESENT
FOR YOUR NEW GIRLFRIEND?

23:16.566 --> 23:20.430
I-IT IS A GREAT JOB
WITH GREAT PEOPLE,

23:20.430 --> 23:23.172
ONE OF WHOM... (chuckles)
JUST HAPPENS TO BE--

23:23.172 --> 23:26.676
YEAH, YEAH, MM-HMM.
(Teddy laughs)
THAT'S OKAY. I'M NOT MAD.

23:26.676 --> 23:29.709
I'M JUST GONNA ENJOY
ALL THE WAYS THAT YOU'RE GONNA

23:29.709 --> 23:31.781
HAVE TO
MAKE IT UP TO ME.
OKAY.

23:31.781 --> 23:34.714
(Callie laughs)
(Meredith) SO HOW DO YOU LIKE
YOUR PRESENT?

23:34.714 --> 23:36.686
OH, PRIVATE BENJAMIN
OVER THERE?

23:36.686 --> 23:39.489
OWEN SAID SHE WOULD
SURPRISE ME. WELL, GUESS WHAT.

23:39.489 --> 23:42.151
SURPRISE! SHE DOESN'T KNOW
HOW TO DO SURGERY.

23:42.151 --> 23:44.454
LEAVE HER ALONE.
IT'S HER FIRST DAY.

23:44.454 --> 23:47.426
WHY ARE YOU DEFENDING HER?
SHE WENT TO STATE SCHOOL.
SO DID I.

23:47.426 --> 23:50.099
WELL, SHE'S SKINNY
AND BLONDE.

23:50.099 --> 23:52.201
SO'S MER.

23:52.201 --> 23:53.903
WELL, SHE'S ANNOYING.

23:53.903 --> 23:55.765
SO ARE YOU.

23:55.765 --> 23:58.437
WHERE IS YOUR WIFE,
BY THE WAY?

23:58.437 --> 24:00.970
I--WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO OWEN?

24:00.970 --> 24:02.642
OH, THAT SHE'S GOTTA GO.

24:02.642 --> 24:04.844
I MEAN, HE KNOWS
HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS TO ME.

24:04.844 --> 24:08.017
I NEED SOMEONE WHO'S GONNA
TAKE ME TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

24:08.017 --> 24:10.480
AND HE BRINGS ME, LIKE,
THIS DESERT STORM BARBIE

24:10.480 --> 24:13.483
WHO HASN'T SEEN THE INSIDE
OF AN O.R. IN, LIKE, TEN YEARS?

24:13.483 --> 24:15.955
I MEAN, IF THIS IS WHAT
HE THINKS OF MY TALENT,

24:15.955 --> 24:18.828
THEN I'M--I-I GOTTA
BREAK UP WITH HIM.

24:18.828 --> 24:21.591
HAVE YOU EVEN TALKED
TO IZZIE YET?

24:21.591 --> 24:26.095
I MEAN, HAS ANYONE
TALKED TO HER?
YOU KNOW WHAT? NO ONE'S ALLOWED
TO TALK ABOUT IZZIE WHILE I EAT.

24:26.095 --> 24:29.499
(mouth full) AM I
THE ONLY ONE CONCERNED HERE?

24:29.499 --> 24:31.501
WHAT?
IT'S MY FIRST DAY BACK.

24:31.501 --> 24:34.103
I JUST WANTED TO HAVE
A NICE, NORMAL LUNCH TOGETHER.

24:34.103 --> 24:36.145
(normal voice) OH, YEAH?
WELL, TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

24:36.145 --> 24:37.747
NOTHING'S NORMAL.

24:37.747 --> 24:40.810
(bell dings)
(laughs)

24:40.810 --> 24:43.152
IT'S A 45-MINUTE SURGERY.

24:43.152 --> 24:45.154
IT'S A $10,000-SURGERY.

24:45.154 --> 24:47.917
AND THIS HOSPITAL HAS
A PRO-BONO BUDGET.

24:47.917 --> 24:49.919
YOU ARE NO LONGER
A DOCTOR HERE, STEVENS.

24:49.919 --> 24:52.522
AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO COME IN HERE

24:52.522 --> 24:54.924
AND COMMANDEER A CLINIC,
A NEUROSURGEON AND A RESIDENT.

24:54.924 --> 24:56.926
I GAVE YOU $8 MILLION
TO BUILD THAT CLINIC

24:56.926 --> 24:59.028
THAT YOU HAPPILY ACCEPTED
AT THE TIME.

24:59.028 --> 25:01.200
SO I HAVE NO PROBLEM
GOING TO THE BOARD

25:01.200 --> 25:03.733
OR THE PRESS IF I HAVE TO

25:03.733 --> 25:07.076
TO GET DR. SINGER
THE SURGERY HE NEEDS.

25:09.108 --> 25:11.110
(Arizona) WHERE'D YOU WORK
WITH JORDAN HAMLIN?

25:11.110 --> 25:13.112
GOD. SHE'S BEEN
AT STANFORD FOREVER.

25:13.112 --> 25:15.114
YEAH, JORDAN HAMLIN AND I
WERE BUNKMATES

25:15.114 --> 25:16.946
AT CAMP TAKA-TOKA
WHEN WE WERE 11.

25:16.946 --> 25:18.788
THAT GIRL CAN MAKE
A MEAN LANYARD.

25:18.788 --> 25:21.551
(laughs) YOU GUYS PAGED ME.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
UH, THIS IS CASEY, AGE 8,

25:21.551 --> 25:23.653
ASTHMATIC, UH, NEBS AT HOME
HAVEN'T BEEN WORKING.

25:23.653 --> 25:27.256
WE ADDED STEROIDS, BUT HE'S
STILL HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING.
CASEY, I'M DR. ROBBINS.

25:27.256 --> 25:29.859
I'M GONNA TAKE A LOOK
AT YOUR X-RAYS.
YOU MIND?

25:29.859 --> 25:32.161
NO, GO AHEAD.

25:32.161 --> 25:35.034
HEY, CASEY. I'M JUST
GONNA TAKE A LISTEN.

25:35.034 --> 25:38.007
(breathing raspily)

25:44.073 --> 25:46.175
DR. ALTMAN, ARE YOU--

25:46.175 --> 25:48.277
TRYING TO CONCENTRATE,
DR. YANG.

25:48.277 --> 25:51.020
HAS CASEY HAD ANY OTHER
MEDICAL ISSUES?

25:51.020 --> 25:54.053
(Cristina) A FEBRILE SEIZURE
AT 3 MONTHS.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.956
OKAY. CAN YOU SIT UP FOR ME?
(raspy breathing continues)

25:56.956 --> 25:59.328
AND DID HE SCREAM A LOT
WHEN YOU BROUGHT HIM HOME

25:59.328 --> 26:01.290
FROM THE HOSPITAL?
YES.

26:01.290 --> 26:02.992
AND HAS HIS ASTHMA

26:02.992 --> 26:06.796
GOTTEN BETTER OR WORSE
AS HE'S GOTTEN OLDER?
WORSE.

26:06.796 --> 26:09.999
OKAY. THANKS.
(raspy breathing continues)

26:09.999 --> 26:11.570
BOOK AN O.R.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.142
WHAT? WHY?

26:13.142 --> 26:15.274
BECAUSE I SAID SO.
BUT HE HAS ASTHMA.

26:15.274 --> 26:18.908
CARDIAC ASTHMA, DR. YANG.
AND YOU KNOW THAT BECAUSE?

26:18.908 --> 26:21.280
BECAUSE THAT SEIZURE THAT
HE HAD? IT WASN'T FROM A FEVER.

26:21.280 --> 26:24.253
HE HAD A HEART ATTACK THEN
AND HE'S HAVING ONE NOW.

26:24.253 --> 26:27.857
SO YOU'RE GONNA BOOK AN O.R.
BECAUSE I'M YOUR ATTENDING,

26:27.857 --> 26:31.060
AND WHEN I TELL YOU TO BOOK
AN O.R., BOOK AN O.R.

26:35.164 --> 26:37.166
I LIKE HER.

26:37.166 --> 26:39.669
(elevator bell dings)

26:44.133 --> 26:46.335
I'M GOING TO SAY A NAME,

26:46.335 --> 26:48.337
AND THEN YOU
ARE GOING TO TELL ME

26:48.337 --> 26:51.711
YOU ARE NOT
HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH HER.

26:51.711 --> 26:54.143
IZZIE STEVENS.

26:54.143 --> 26:55.314
WHAT?

26:55.314 --> 26:58.287
WHAT? THAT'S WHY YOU IGNORED
THE D.N.R.

26:58.287 --> 27:00.349
THAT'S WHY YOU FIRED HER.
(laughing)

27:00.349 --> 27:02.351
THAT'S WHY THE TWO OF YOU

27:02.351 --> 27:05.194
WERE IN YOUR OFFICE
SCREAMING AT EACH OTHER...

27:05.194 --> 27:08.197
(continues laughing)
JUST--
IT IS NOT FUNNY, CHIEF.

27:08.197 --> 27:10.730
THAT GIRL HAS CANCER

27:10.730 --> 27:13.232
AND A HUSBAND AND...
(continues laughing)

27:13.232 --> 27:15.935
OKAY. YEAH, I KNOW,
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

27:15.935 --> 27:18.167
BUT IT'S NOW AFFECTING
PEOPLE'S LIVES,

27:18.167 --> 27:20.109
PATIENT'S LIVES.

27:20.109 --> 27:22.211
WHAT'S THIS?

27:22.211 --> 27:24.073
IT'S THE E.R.C.P. RESULTS

27:24.073 --> 27:26.075
OF YOUR EMERGENCY CHOLE
THIS MORNING.

27:26.075 --> 27:29.378
IT SEEMS THAT YOU MAY HAVE
ACCIDENTALLY CLIPPED

27:29.378 --> 27:31.951
THE COMMON BILE DUCT.

27:40.229 --> 27:41.961
HOW'S THE PATIENT?

27:41.961 --> 27:44.263
STABLE, FOR NOW.

27:44.263 --> 27:46.395
I TOLD GREY AND ADAMSON

27:46.395 --> 27:49.098
TO PREP HIM FOR A REPAIR,

27:49.098 --> 27:51.100
WHICH I'M HAPPY TO DO

27:51.100 --> 27:54.804
IF YOU DON'T FEEL...

27:54.804 --> 27:58.077
LOOK, WE CAUGHT IT
EARLY ENOUGH THAT,

27:58.077 --> 28:00.079
IF WE CAN REPAIR THE DUCT,

28:00.079 --> 28:03.382
THERE SHOULD BE
NO LONG-TERM DAMAGE.

28:03.382 --> 28:05.915
GOOD.

28:05.915 --> 28:08.687
NO ONE
KNOWS ABOUT THIS, SIR.

28:10.419 --> 28:13.292
AND NO ONE'S GOING TO KNOW.

28:13.292 --> 28:15.694
(sighs)

28:15.694 --> 28:19.899
BUT WHATEVER IT IS
THAT'S DISTRACTING YOU--

28:19.899 --> 28:24.433
WHOEVER OR WHATEVER IT IS--

28:24.433 --> 28:28.377
I JUST HOPE YOU GET
A HANDLE ON IT SOON.

28:41.851 --> 28:44.854
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

28:46.425 --> 28:48.427
THE BIRDS ON YOUR SCRUB CAP
ARE CUTE.

28:48.427 --> 28:51.030
THANK YOU.

28:51.030 --> 28:54.063
IS HE ON FULL BYPASS?
YES.

28:54.063 --> 28:56.305
SEE THE ANATOMY HERE?

28:56.305 --> 28:57.807
(Cristina) THE CORONARY ARTERY

28:57.807 --> 29:00.770
IS ATTACHED TO THE PULMONARY
ARTERY NOT THE AORTA.

29:00.770 --> 29:03.873
IT PRESENTED AS ASTHMA,
BUT IT'S ALCAPA.
(Jackson) HOW DID YOU KNOW?

29:03.873 --> 29:06.045
I MEAN,
YOU ONLY LISTENED TO HIM

29:06.045 --> 29:09.518
AND ASKED HIS MOM
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.
I SAW SOME CARDIOMEGALY
ON HIS X-RAYS.

29:09.518 --> 29:12.251
AND I HEARD A HOLOSYSTOLIC
MURMUR THROUGH HIS WHEEZING.

29:12.251 --> 29:14.253
YOU'LL KNOW FOR NEXT TIME.

29:14.253 --> 29:17.056
AND AFTER TODAY, DR. YANG,

29:17.056 --> 29:19.188
YOU'LL KNOW HOW TO FIX IT.

29:19.188 --> 29:21.290
ME? I...

29:21.290 --> 29:23.432
I THOUGHT YOU
AND DR. ROBBINS WERE...

29:23.432 --> 29:26.265
