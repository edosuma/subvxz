00:21.822 --> 00:24.592
*

00:24.657 --> 00:27.994
Brooklyn: This is a story
about the guy I fell for.

00:28.062 --> 00:30.297
But to really
understand why,

00:30.363 --> 00:34.202
You have to know
a little bit about
the game he loves.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.174
The game has been played
by native Americans

00:40.241 --> 00:41.809
For centuries.

00:41.874 --> 00:44.044
It requires speed
and agility,

00:44.112 --> 00:46.147
Teamwork, strategy,

00:46.214 --> 00:48.716
And a bit of violence.

00:53.286 --> 00:55.522
You may know it
as lacrosse,

00:55.589 --> 00:57.990
But native Americans
know it as baaga'adowe...

00:58.058 --> 00:59.859
The little brother of war.

00:59.926 --> 01:01.429
Their matches took days

01:01.495 --> 01:03.564
And were played
over Miles of terrain.

01:03.631 --> 01:07.367
The winners got land,
wives, and sometimes glory.

01:12.373 --> 01:14.975
There's a lot
that's different
about the game now.

01:15.042 --> 01:17.878
But the thing
a player needs most
hasn't changed at all.

01:17.945 --> 01:20.280
And if you find
someone who has it,

01:20.347 --> 01:23.251
I'd tell you
to never let go.

01:28.589 --> 01:32.360
(Whistle blows,
crowd cheers)

01:47.275 --> 01:49.810
(Overlapping shouts)

01:51.145 --> 01:52.646
Get it over there!
Center it!

01:52.713 --> 01:56.082
Swing it!
Watch his pass!

01:56.150 --> 01:58.886
(Shouting continues)

01:58.951 --> 02:00.086
(Whistle blows)

02:00.120 --> 02:02.655
(Shouting continues)

02:11.131 --> 02:12.799
(Whistle blows)

02:12.866 --> 02:15.902
Who's Jimmy's back-up?
Hanson.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.740
We're in trouble.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.341
(Whistle blows)

02:21.408 --> 02:23.843
(Sportscast playing
on radio)

02:25.379 --> 02:29.081
Hey, coach says he's
having second thoughts.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.452
*

02:34.086 --> 02:35.689
You ready for this?

02:35.756 --> 02:37.457
I was born ready,
bro.

02:37.524 --> 02:39.227
Whoa.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.731
A moment with
my player, ref?

02:43.797 --> 02:47.400
Hansen's the backup,
and I don't want to
hear any arguments.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.001
I thought I was getting
a second chance.

02:49.068 --> 02:50.671
You're arguing.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.539
There's a delay of game
penalty with your name on it

02:52.605 --> 02:55.309
If I don't get
a resolution A.S.A.P.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.278
I can win this.

02:57.345 --> 02:59.213
What's it gonna be,
coach?

03:02.182 --> 03:03.817
(Whistle blows)

03:06.320 --> 03:08.256
We'll run a switchblade
first, coach says.

03:08.321 --> 03:09.822
Yeah, sure.

03:09.889 --> 03:13.326
I mean it, man...
Switchblade!

03:13.393 --> 03:14.727
Trying to win the
game by yourself.

03:14.794 --> 03:16.297
My play is called
"the iceman".

03:16.364 --> 03:19.933
I'm not talking
about your play.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.502
Do it... switchblade.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.372
Bring us all in.

03:24.438 --> 03:25.739
You got no time
for one shot,

03:25.806 --> 03:27.308
And I know wherever
you're going.

03:27.375 --> 03:31.143
15 seconds?
All I need is 10.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.981
(Whistle blows)

03:34.046 --> 03:36.350
All right, go! Go! Go!

03:41.389 --> 03:43.089
Come on, Conor!
Switchblade!

03:43.155 --> 03:45.191
Run switchblade!

03:45.259 --> 03:47.861
Conor, pass! Sullivan,
that's not switchblade!

04:20.293 --> 04:23.530
(Cheering)

04:37.577 --> 04:39.780
Good job out there.
Good job out there.

04:42.181 --> 04:44.452
Hey, Riggins.

04:44.517 --> 04:46.387
Hey, did that go in?
I didn't see.

04:46.454 --> 04:48.521
Conor, man, let it go.

04:48.588 --> 04:50.723
Come on, fighting
means suspension.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.861
That was wonderful.
Yeah, nice, man.

04:53.927 --> 04:56.763
You should call
your father.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.999
The only time
he won't pick up

04:59.066 --> 05:00.300
Is when he's
on patrol.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.834
He's okay.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.437
Dad calls that
"being in the shit".

05:03.504 --> 05:04.904
Hey, Keegan!
Top-key mushrooms.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.406
Maybe he didn't
pick up

05:06.473 --> 05:07.875
Because his phone
is turned off.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.143
Or maybe dad flew back
early from Iraq

05:10.210 --> 05:11.812
To surprise his family.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.815
Dad, you're home!
Ha ha ha!

05:14.882 --> 05:17.918
You're looking
rather dashing,
colonel Sullivan.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.952
As are you,
Mrs. Sullivan.

05:20.019 --> 05:22.254
Perhaps I could escort you
home after this.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.991
Perhaps you should.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.859
Heh!
Aww.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.727
Perhaps I could
escort you home
right now.

05:27.794 --> 05:29.329
Easy, marine.
Get a room.

05:29.397 --> 05:30.763
Ahh.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.400
So, how come
you're home?

05:32.466 --> 05:33.867
I'm wondering
the same thing.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.836
Can't a guy just
slip away from the war

05:35.903 --> 05:38.738
Without his family
thinking something's up?

05:38.805 --> 05:40.172
No.

05:40.239 --> 05:41.442
(Laughter)

05:41.509 --> 05:43.544
I got some news.

05:54.320 --> 05:57.525
I'll be right back.

05:57.590 --> 06:00.360
Where are you going?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.662
30 minutes, Conor.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.000
Conor:
I can win this.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.603
Dad: Other than the fact
that you let 14 get
inside your head,

06:09.670 --> 06:11.872
I thought you were
ten tons of awesome.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.473
Why are we
doing this, dad?
You know why.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.074
We're gonna
move again.

06:15.141 --> 06:16.477
Then they'll
call you back,

06:16.544 --> 06:18.111
And it'll all
be for what?

06:18.178 --> 06:19.880
Sorry, pal, that's
the military life.

06:19.947 --> 06:23.082
Sometimes you gotta
just suck it up, son.

06:53.481 --> 06:56.183
(Sighs)

07:00.420 --> 07:03.355
Conor... It's
very important

07:03.423 --> 07:05.959
That you tone your
attitude down here
on and off the field.

07:06.025 --> 07:08.662
I had to pull some
strings to get you
in here.

07:08.729 --> 07:13.166
I want you to promise me
that you'll show humility.

07:18.571 --> 07:20.307
Conor, you listening
to me?

07:20.372 --> 07:22.141
Not really, dad.

07:28.315 --> 07:30.717
(Chuckles) Come on.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.662
He's really cute.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.831
Brooklyn: It's funny
what you notice

07:44.897 --> 07:46.534
The first time
you see someone...

07:46.600 --> 07:49.435
Confidence, a nice smile,

07:49.503 --> 07:51.437
A little connection.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.140
What you don't see...

07:53.205 --> 07:55.509
What's impossible to know
at first glance...

07:55.576 --> 07:57.578
Is everything else.

07:57.645 --> 08:00.113
At least everything
that counts.

08:05.785 --> 08:09.222
Hey, dad, how many
of those are yours?

08:09.289 --> 08:10.958
That one.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.996
And my name
is on that one.

08:16.063 --> 08:20.199
And that was taken
right after the state
championship.

08:20.266 --> 08:22.201
How many of those
did you win?

08:22.268 --> 08:23.537
Four in a row.
Four?

08:23.604 --> 08:25.938
Heh heh.
All right.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.340
Hey, who's that
one guy you always...

08:28.407 --> 08:30.010
Dave Milligan.

08:30.077 --> 08:32.443
You're about
to meet him.

08:32.511 --> 08:37.950
Straighten your tie.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.486
He played on
one of the best
west coast teams ever.

08:40.554 --> 08:43.056
The kid scored
70 goals last year.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.891
Look, nobody
plays varsity
their first year.

08:44.957 --> 08:46.594
I can't bench somebody
who's paid their dues.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.195
It wouldn't be fair.

08:48.260 --> 08:50.564
Since when are you
a stickler for propriety?

08:50.631 --> 08:52.666
Why'd you
bring him here?

08:52.733 --> 08:54.500
Because, despite our
considerable differences,

08:54.568 --> 08:56.036
I know your reputation
as a coach,

08:56.103 --> 08:57.770
And you turn out
a hell of a lacrosse player.

08:59.405 --> 09:02.910
We play real lacrosse
here, not that west
coast field hockey.

09:02.975 --> 09:04.977
Just play him,
see how he does.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.213
I'm not asking
for favors.

09:07.279 --> 09:10.117
I'm doing you
a favor just by
giving him a look,

09:10.182 --> 09:14.387
And right now,
that's all I can
give you.

09:14.454 --> 09:16.255
Fair enough.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.903
(Indistinct chatter)

09:49.623 --> 09:51.224
Can I help you?

09:51.291 --> 09:54.227
Thanks,
but I'm pretty good
at dressing myself.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.829
No, varsity only here.
Scrubs dress in there.

09:58.330 --> 10:02.469
So, you're what passes
as varsity around here?

10:02.535 --> 10:04.437
Yeah.

10:04.503 --> 10:07.240
Heh. Awesome.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.963
Yo, skip,
toss me a ball.

10:31.030 --> 10:34.000
Watch the ball.
Sticks up, sticks up.

10:34.066 --> 10:36.602
Watch that throw.
Watch the ball!

10:36.670 --> 10:38.570
Let's go!

10:38.638 --> 10:40.273
Great, guys.
Keep the pace up.

10:40.340 --> 10:43.109
Stay focused.
Really well done.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.977
Good, keep
the ball moving.

10:46.714 --> 10:49.349
Oh, you're late,
west coast.
It's 4:00.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.685
If you're not early,
you're late.
You owe me a lap.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.687
Let's go,
cradle it out.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.888
Sticks up. Keep your
feet moving.

10:55.955 --> 10:58.759
Nice. Nicely done.
Watch the ball.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.660
Get the energy up.
Sticks up.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.095
You okay?

11:04.664 --> 11:06.666
Cradle it out.
Sticks up.

11:15.575 --> 11:18.377
Sticks up! Sticks up!

11:18.444 --> 11:19.780
(Overlapping shouts)

11:19.847 --> 11:21.948
Come on,
you can take him!

11:24.417 --> 11:26.486
(Grunting)

11:26.553 --> 11:28.188
(Laughs)

11:28.255 --> 11:30.089
You think you can
do better, Sullivan?

11:30.156 --> 11:32.292
Only one way
to find out.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.794
Switch up your Jersey
to white.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.362
Coach,
give me a whistle.

11:35.427 --> 11:36.764
You got it, coach.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.265
(Blows whistle)

11:38.331 --> 11:40.801
Braveheart, give me
Bryant! Let's go

11:40.868 --> 11:43.737
(Overlapping shouts)

11:45.272 --> 11:47.707
Bryant, Sullivan,
let's go!

11:47.775 --> 11:52.412
Anytime today, Sullivan!
Here we go!

11:52.479 --> 11:53.713
Joe's gonna crush you.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.447
One-on-one,
go on my whistle.

11:55.514 --> 11:58.752
First one to score wins.
It's that simple. Got it?

11:58.819 --> 12:00.720
Down. Keep it clean.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.590
Good luck, brother.
I'm not your brother.

12:03.655 --> 12:06.525
Oh, we're all brothers
in lacrosse, west coast.

12:06.593 --> 12:09.361
(Whistle blows)

12:12.699 --> 12:15.568
Come on!
Come on, west coast!

12:15.635 --> 12:17.870
(Grunting)

12:19.807 --> 12:21.842
No, no, no, no!

12:21.909 --> 12:23.509
Hey!

12:23.575 --> 12:24.576
Yeah!

12:24.643 --> 12:26.512
(Cheering)

12:29.215 --> 12:31.852
You should've
shot when you
had the chance.

12:31.919 --> 12:34.387
Yeah, I guess so.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.857
Welcome to Briarfield,
Sullivan.

12:49.701 --> 12:51.805
Conor.

12:51.872 --> 12:52.873
Conor.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.843
Hey, come on, wake up.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.643
Dad? Is the house
on fire?

12:57.709 --> 12:59.178
No, it's morning.

13:01.814 --> 13:04.117
No, it isn't.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.421
It's close enough.
Let's go.

13:12.892 --> 13:16.428
(Laughing and grunting)

13:16.495 --> 13:18.764
Not bad, not bad.

13:18.832 --> 13:20.232
(Cell phone rings)

13:20.300 --> 13:23.069
Hang on a sec.
I gotta take this call.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.740
Sullivan.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.442
Morning, general.

13:32.078 --> 13:33.947
Yes, sir.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.519
Right. Okay.

13:40.988 --> 13:43.090
Thank you, sir.

13:45.993 --> 13:48.495
What was that about?
Nothing.

13:48.560 --> 13:51.865
Just some advisory work
they want me to do.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.466
That it?
Yeah, that's it.

13:53.533 --> 13:54.700
Don't worry about it.

13:54.766 --> 13:56.503
Let's go.

14:00.206 --> 14:00.840
Okay.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.810
Keep your arms
extended, this side.

14:03.876 --> 14:05.678
Let's see
what you got. Go.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.646
(Grunting)

14:07.714 --> 14:09.448
Oh, nice, nice.

14:09.515 --> 14:12.451
Except you gotta
learn how to shoot.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.922
Who's gonna pick up
a guy who shoots
like a drunk woman?

14:14.987 --> 14:16.522
Huh? Come on.

14:16.589 --> 14:17.990
*

14:20.460 --> 14:23.530
Brooklyn:
There are a bunch of ways
to find out about someone.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.665
You can watch them
around other people,

14:25.732 --> 14:27.968
Find out what
their interests are,

14:28.035 --> 14:30.136
How they react
to new circumstances.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.304
Sometimes, if you
really want to know,

14:32.372 --> 14:34.706
It's easiest to just
talk to them yourself.

14:34.773 --> 14:36.742
Hey.
Hey.

14:36.808 --> 14:38.645
Hey yourself,
newbie.

14:38.710 --> 14:41.113
Name's Conor Sullivan.

14:42.781 --> 14:44.551
Brooklyn...

14:44.616 --> 14:46.053
Milligan.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.655
Ahem.

14:50.722 --> 14:52.691
(Mutters)
Coach's daughter. Ahem.

14:52.758 --> 14:54.293
(Laughs)

14:54.360 --> 14:56.029
So, my dad says
you come out here

14:56.096 --> 14:57.729
To practice
every day at 5 A.M.

14:57.796 --> 14:59.265
Oh, does he?
He does.

14:59.331 --> 15:02.869
Does that make you wonder
how your dad knows that?

15:02.935 --> 15:04.570
Because it sure
makes me wonder.

15:04.637 --> 15:05.939
(Laughs)

15:06.005 --> 15:07.073
Hey, Joe, think fast!

15:07.139 --> 15:09.608
Ha ha! Hey, babe.

15:09.675 --> 15:11.077
Hey.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.611
Hey, this is
my girlfriend Charlie.

15:12.678 --> 15:13.880
Hey.
Hey.

15:13.946 --> 15:15.547
Um...

15:15.614 --> 15:17.616
We should probably
get back to practice.

15:17.683 --> 15:18.918
Yeah.

15:18.986 --> 15:21.021
See you later.
Bye.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.622
See you later.
See you later.

15:25.792 --> 15:28.728
Nothing's hotter than
chicks with sticks.

15:28.795 --> 15:29.929
Nothing.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.431
Just doesn't sound right.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.100
I didn't mean it
that way.

15:33.165 --> 15:36.235
(Overlapping shouts)

15:47.047 --> 15:50.349
Gotta watch the pick!

15:50.416 --> 15:52.318
Ohh.

15:52.384 --> 15:55.588
(Grunts)

15:55.655 --> 15:56.822
This kid can play.

15:56.888 --> 15:58.390
He most definitely
can play.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.527
So, what do you think?
You want to move him up?

16:00.593 --> 16:02.429
We'll see where he is
in a week.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.700
Hey.

16:10.069 --> 16:12.305
Nice practice.
Thanks.

16:14.073 --> 16:17.044
You're not
taking my spot.

16:17.109 --> 16:18.944
Do you play
right-side attack?

16:19.012 --> 16:20.446
Damn straight.

16:20.513 --> 16:24.450
Then I'm definitely
taking your spot.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.387
Let it go.

16:33.892 --> 16:36.228
(Chuckles) Ahh.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.367
(Knock on door)

16:41.433 --> 16:44.104
You wanted to see me?

16:47.973 --> 16:50.777
Yeah, take a seat.

16:50.842 --> 16:53.979
So, uh, you've been
practicing with us...

16:54.047 --> 16:56.116
For, what,
about a week now?

16:56.183 --> 16:58.817
What do you think?

16:58.884 --> 17:00.919
Uh...

17:00.986 --> 17:03.523
Well, I think you've
got a good system
going on...

17:03.590 --> 17:05.757
Thanks, kid,
but I don't need you
to kiss my butt.

17:05.824 --> 17:08.460
I'm asking if you can
play with them.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.929
Not a one-man dance
out there,

17:09.996 --> 17:12.598
But actually working
with them as a unit.

17:12.664 --> 17:15.001
I thought you weren't
gonna play me.

17:15.067 --> 17:16.734
Well, that may change.

17:16.801 --> 17:18.405
May?
May.

17:18.470 --> 17:20.005
You're not the God's gift
you think you are,

17:20.073 --> 17:21.473
But you're better
than I expected.

17:24.510 --> 17:27.046
Yes... I can play
with them.

17:27.114 --> 17:28.781
Good. You'll suit up
on Friday.

17:28.848 --> 17:31.817
It's our last game
before the playoffs.

17:31.883 --> 17:34.853
Impress me.

17:34.920 --> 17:38.091
(Overlapping shouts)

17:39.726 --> 17:41.161
Why isn't he
playing Conor?

17:41.228 --> 17:42.928
Relax, he knows
what he's doing.

17:42.994 --> 17:45.431
I don't think Dave's
gonna give him a fair shot.

17:45.497 --> 17:49.068
You know
us Sullivans, huh?

17:49.136 --> 17:50.869
We always a way
to get it done.

17:50.936 --> 17:52.672
(Laughs)

17:52.739 --> 17:54.207
Move your feet!

17:54.274 --> 17:57.076
Let's have some
pressure, defense!

18:01.080 --> 18:03.882
All right, Dupree out!

18:03.950 --> 18:06.051
Sullivan!

18:06.119 --> 18:08.455
Eh-eh.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.157
Remember what
I told you?

18:10.222 --> 18:13.560
You got it?
Got it, coach.

18:13.625 --> 18:15.828
Dad: Okay,
here we go.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.429
It's about time.

18:17.496 --> 18:19.332
He just wanted to show
Conor who's boss.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.066
You think that taught
Conor anything?

18:21.134 --> 18:22.269
Heh! Doubt it.

18:22.335 --> 18:25.272
(Shouting)

18:32.145 --> 18:35.382
Let's go, baby!
Nice goin'!

18:35.447 --> 18:39.286
You gotta get your body
between the ball
and the goal, son.

18:39.351 --> 18:41.019
What is this,
girls' volleyball?

18:41.086 --> 18:42.354
(Cell phone ringing)

18:42.421 --> 18:45.023
Good scrimmage!
First team, come off!

18:45.090 --> 18:46.759
I'll be right back.

18:46.826 --> 18:49.094
Dave: Nice job,
first team, good work.

18:49.162 --> 18:52.332
Good work today. Nice.

18:52.399 --> 18:56.568
Good effort.
Let's go, second team!

18:56.636 --> 18:59.104
Let's see some pressure,
let's hear some talk!

18:59.172 --> 19:01.140
That's what I'm talk...
come on, let's hear
some talk!

19:02.141 --> 19:03.776
(Shouting)

19:03.843 --> 19:06.111
Come on, let's go!
Keep it moving!

19:06.179 --> 19:07.847
Keep that ball high!

19:07.914 --> 19:09.915
(Shouting continues)

19:17.289 --> 19:20.227
(Whistle blows)

19:20.292 --> 19:21.894
End of the day.
Hit the showers.

19:21.961 --> 19:24.129
Good work today.

19:24.197 --> 19:26.666
Good work today,
everybody.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.277
You didn't
have to wait.

19:37.344 --> 19:40.045
Well, I think
we should talk.

19:40.111 --> 19:42.181
All right.

19:46.753 --> 19:49.322
So, who was that
on the phone?

19:53.760 --> 19:56.229
They need me
back in Iraq.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.066
Well,
mom needs you here.

20:01.132 --> 20:03.369
So does Keegan.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.574
Under six months.
That's it.

20:07.639 --> 20:09.641
That's just
another surge.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.877
We could've just
stayed in California.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.845
At least then
I'd have some friends
to hang out with...

20:13.912 --> 20:19.586
I know it wasn't
part of the plan.

20:19.651 --> 20:22.988
Then this is where
you need to be.

20:23.054 --> 20:24.957
This is your future.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.960
Six months.

20:32.197 --> 20:34.032
Come on.

20:34.099 --> 20:36.869
*

20:48.046 --> 20:49.749
Conor?

20:49.816 --> 20:52.083
I've got something
for you.

20:52.150 --> 20:53.218
What is it?

20:53.286 --> 20:55.186
A box of roses.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.656
Just open it.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.863
That's what you said
they called you, right?

21:03.929 --> 21:05.765
Captain America?

21:07.733 --> 21:10.737
Hope you score
a lot of goals
with that, son.

21:10.802 --> 21:13.773
But it's important
how you score.

21:13.840 --> 21:17.042
Never put yourself
above the game.

21:20.447 --> 21:23.114
Now, give your
old man a hug.

21:23.181 --> 21:25.284
Come on.

21:32.392 --> 21:35.160
I'll have my
right hand shot down
when you get back.

21:35.226 --> 21:37.028
Can't wait.

21:38.498 --> 21:40.699
Keep your head down
over there.

21:40.766 --> 21:43.535
You just keep your
head up over here.

22:22.541 --> 22:26.713
(Alarm ringing)

22:40.191 --> 22:42.794
*

23:05.084 --> 23:07.019
He's here.

23:14.526 --> 23:16.027
You're late,
west coast.

23:16.094 --> 23:19.097
Late to my own practice
that you're intruding on.

23:19.164 --> 23:20.467
Intruding, huh?

23:20.532 --> 23:22.401
We could leave.

23:22.469 --> 23:25.370
You can stay.

23:25.438 --> 23:28.039
My work here is done.

23:30.542 --> 23:32.278
At least try
to play hard-to-get.

23:32.343 --> 23:33.946
Shut up.

23:37.315 --> 23:39.250
You ready?

23:39.317 --> 23:42.088
Let's do it.

23:42.153 --> 23:43.456
(Grunting)

23:54.299 --> 23:56.068
You okay?

23:56.135 --> 23:59.671
Yeah. Fine.

24:08.680 --> 24:10.917
I can't shoot
with this thing.

24:10.982 --> 24:13.151
Shooting strings
are a mess.

24:13.218 --> 24:15.522
Ahh.

24:15.587 --> 24:18.558
Much better.

24:18.625 --> 24:21.159
Maybe if you didn't
shoot so hard.

24:29.569 --> 24:32.170
I heard
about your dad.

24:32.237 --> 24:35.306
Yeah?

24:35.373 --> 24:37.442
How long
is he gone for?

24:37.510 --> 24:40.112
Six months.
Hmm.

24:43.314 --> 24:45.184
(Car horn honks)

24:49.220 --> 24:50.623
(Sighs)

24:54.627 --> 24:56.962
Same time tomorrow?

24:58.665 --> 25:01.299
Well, I'd hate
to intrude.

25:01.366 --> 25:03.769
(Chuckles)

25:06.437 --> 25:09.141
Uhh!

25:11.243 --> 25:12.478
Morning.

25:12.544 --> 25:15.647
(Sighs)

25:15.714 --> 25:17.516
It's fine.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.552
When your daughter
leaves the house
before dawn,

25:19.619 --> 25:21.152
It's not spying,
it's parenting.

25:21.219 --> 25:22.487
(Scoffs)

25:22.555 --> 25:23.955
I'm not sure
it's a good idea

25:24.023 --> 25:25.657
To hang around
that Sullivan kid,
though.

25:25.724 --> 25:29.294
Dad, I barely
even know him.

25:29.360 --> 25:31.797
Right.

25:36.401 --> 25:38.469
Everybody gather up!

25:38.537 --> 25:40.505
Whole team, gather!
Let's go!

25:40.573 --> 25:43.309
Everyone, bring it in!

25:43.374 --> 25:44.811
I've just been informed

25:44.876 --> 25:46.746
That Briarfield has been
selected as the location

25:46.813 --> 25:50.683
For the first ever east-west
championship game.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.184
Gentlemen,
it is my intention

25:52.251 --> 25:54.220
That we're not only
hosting that game,

25:54.285 --> 25:56.287
But we're playing in it.

25:56.354 --> 25:59.390
Hands in, men.
Warriors on three.

25:59.457 --> 26:00.559
(Cheering)

26:00.627 --> 26:01.560
One, two, three.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.995
All: Warriors!

26:04.063 --> 26:05.463
Let's go out
and show 'em who we are!

26:05.531 --> 26:07.934
Come on!

26:10.436 --> 26:12.771
(Overlapping shouts)

26:27.586 --> 26:29.721
(Whistle blows)

26:32.057 --> 26:34.661
Sullivan, get in there
for Dupree.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.733
Uhh!
Uhh!

26:44.370 --> 26:46.905
(Overlapping shouts)

27:01.620 --> 27:03.823
Bounce back up.
Let's go.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.494
(Whistle blows)

27:08.559 --> 27:10.596
We got number 9...
unsportsmanlike
conduct.

27:10.662 --> 27:12.031
Two minutes.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.266
That was a stupid play.

27:15.333 --> 27:18.671
He pushed me,
I pushed back.

27:18.738 --> 27:21.307
Come on Briarfield!
Man down!

27:21.373 --> 27:23.142
Let's go!

27:25.476 --> 27:28.147
(Indistinct shouts)

27:55.674 --> 27:57.443
Nice game, Conor.

27:57.508 --> 27:58.778
Except for the penalty.

27:58.845 --> 28:00.511
Dad would've been proud.

28:00.578 --> 28:01.680
Thanks, mom.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.115
There's some mail
for you.

28:07.786 --> 28:09.588
(Laughs)
What is it?

28:09.654 --> 28:15.194
Dad signed me up
for some old-school
lacrosse camp.

28:15.261 --> 28:17.196
Looks good,
doesn't it?

28:17.263 --> 28:19.866
Run by native American
players.

28:19.932 --> 28:22.769
Your dad used to
love it up there.

28:28.339 --> 28:32.543
"Ha ha, dad.
Indian lacrosse camp.

28:32.610 --> 28:35.347
Hooray east coast."

28:40.920 --> 28:43.222
Your dad knows
how to text?

28:43.289 --> 28:46.124
Uh, yeah.
He said he made
his private show him.

28:55.566 --> 28:57.770
(Coughs)

28:57.837 --> 29:00.739
* then we went up

29:00.807 --> 29:02.808
* we are much older

29:02.875 --> 29:05.911
* you wait like an angel

29:05.977 --> 29:08.580
* and I pine
like a soldier *

29:08.647 --> 29:11.650
* but I remember love

29:11.717 --> 29:15.254
* love don't remember me

29:18.791 --> 29:20.892
* it's been a long

29:20.959 --> 29:23.728
* long time

29:23.796 --> 29:26.664
* since I've been on

29:26.731 --> 29:29.667
* your mind

29:29.734 --> 29:31.903
* but I cannot

29:31.970 --> 29:34.739
* decline

29:34.807 --> 29:37.776
* anything for you

29:41.848 --> 29:43.983
* I'll drink the whiskey

29:44.050 --> 29:46.953
* you'll drink
gin and tonic *

29:47.018 --> 29:49.788
* you got
much more strong *

29:49.856 --> 29:52.190
* I got more neurotic

29:52.257 --> 29:54.994
* but I remember love

29:55.061 --> 29:59.030
* but love
don't remember me *

30:23.454 --> 30:28.895
* now that I've been
replaced *

30:28.960 --> 30:34.000
* I have the guts
to face *

30:34.065 --> 30:37.168
(Lyrics indistinct)

30:40.006 --> 30:41.840
Mother: Thank you
for coming.

30:43.808 --> 30:45.477
Is it cold in here?

30:46.744 --> 30:49.115
(Indistinct chatter)

30:57.588 --> 31:00.258
Hey. With all
due respect, son,

31:00.325 --> 31:01.860
I think your mom
needs you here.

31:01.860 --> 31:04.931
I can't stay.
I just can't.

31:04.997 --> 31:07.532
A warrior doesn't
run from pain.

31:07.598 --> 31:10.801
Do the right thing
by your family

31:10.869 --> 31:12.604
And stick around.

31:12.671 --> 31:15.907
I'm sorry,
but I just really need
to get out of here.

31:22.915 --> 31:25.952
(Indistinct chatter)

31:59.418 --> 32:01.920
Hey, you mind
if I, um...

32:24.110 --> 32:25.710
I'm...

32:25.776 --> 32:28.079
I'm so...

32:36.821 --> 32:38.624
It's okay.

32:38.689 --> 32:40.659
I'm so sorry.

32:46.197 --> 32:49.001
I can't go back
in there right now.

32:55.840 --> 32:56.975
Let's...

32:57.043 --> 32:59.277
Let's get out of here.

33:00.479 --> 33:01.980
Okay?

33:01.980 --> 33:04.350
I'll drive.

33:06.018 --> 33:07.686
Yeah.

33:07.753 --> 33:11.223
(Grunting)

33:12.791 --> 33:15.327
Arms extended.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.147
Are you better?

33:35.214 --> 33:37.216
A little.

33:40.018 --> 33:43.021
As good as I can be.

33:51.130 --> 33:53.998
Hey, Brookie.

33:54.066 --> 33:56.535
Come on,
we gotta go.

33:57.935 --> 33:59.504
(Sighs)

34:02.040 --> 34:04.942
See you tomorrow?

34:05.010 --> 34:07.512
You know the time.

34:22.327 --> 34:24.862
I thought I asked you
to stay away from him.

34:24.929 --> 34:26.132
What is your problem?

34:26.197 --> 34:27.733
He just buried
his dad.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.435
He's not real stable
right now.

34:29.500 --> 34:32.103
I just don't want
to see you get hurt.

34:39.409 --> 34:42.513
*

35:13.043 --> 35:14.180
Uhh!

35:14.245 --> 35:15.947
What was that?
What?

35:16.014 --> 35:17.882
What was that?

35:17.949 --> 35:19.785
(Overlapping shouts)

35:21.386 --> 35:23.222
Hey! Hey!

35:23.289 --> 35:24.889
Settle down!
Settle down!

35:24.955 --> 35:26.158
Dupree, you're done.
Back off, back off.

35:26.225 --> 35:27.892
Sullivan, get out.

35:27.958 --> 35:30.929
Go, go.

35:30.996 --> 35:32.164
Get out of here.

35:32.231 --> 35:33.564
Let's go, everybody
back to work.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.866
Come on. Get back
to your stations.

35:35.933 --> 35:37.836
Let's go.

35:48.714 --> 35:50.615
Mom: Is this
about what happened?

35:50.682 --> 35:52.651
Dave: Believe me,
it's not about that.

35:52.718 --> 35:54.786
I have
a responsibility to...

35:56.086 --> 35:57.488
Hello, Conor.

35:57.555 --> 35:59.725
Coach.

35:59.791 --> 36:02.160
I was just talking
with your mother

36:02.160 --> 36:05.196
About whether
to let you play again.

36:08.033 --> 36:10.368
It's been a month
since...

36:12.037 --> 36:14.240
I thought you'd be
a little less
hotheaded by now,

36:14.305 --> 36:17.008
But after today, I...

36:17.075 --> 36:18.809
I need this.

36:20.412 --> 36:22.813
Otherwise, I can't play
at the naval academy.

36:22.880 --> 36:26.285
I know. But I need you
to be a player,
not a liability.

36:26.352 --> 36:27.753
I'm trying to get
this team

36:27.818 --> 36:29.153
In the national
championship game.

36:29.221 --> 36:30.989
We could use you.

36:31.056 --> 36:32.323
But if you fight again,

36:32.390 --> 36:35.827
That's it...
You are off my team.

36:37.662 --> 36:39.430
So, what you're
saying is,

36:39.497 --> 36:41.900
I have to let them
beat on me
and just take it?

36:41.967 --> 36:44.535
If you want to come back
as a player, you're welcome.

36:44.602 --> 36:46.937
Otherwise,
don't come back at all.

36:47.004 --> 36:49.308
But what you're doing
out there now

36:49.375 --> 36:51.843
Is not lacrosse.

36:54.011 --> 36:55.847
Brooklyn: You think
you know someone.

36:55.914 --> 36:58.048
You have
a nice connection.

36:58.115 --> 37:00.286
But before they can
let you in,

37:00.352 --> 37:01.853
They've got to
let themselves in.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.590
They have to learn
their own heart.

37:04.655 --> 37:06.957
Come on,
you're gonna be late.

37:08.659 --> 37:10.328
Come on,
you said yourself
you needed to play.

37:10.395 --> 37:12.162
Don't waste
this opportunity.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.999
I'm not going.
You've been given
a second chance.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.934
Just leave me alone.

37:17.001 --> 37:19.136
Honey, I know
this is hard for you.

37:19.203 --> 37:20.772
Do you?!

37:30.180 --> 37:32.984
Come on.
You need to
suck it up, mom.

37:34.786 --> 37:37.889
That's what this is?
You're sucking it up?

37:37.956 --> 37:39.825
Since you've got
it all figured out,

37:39.891 --> 37:41.692
Why don't you
step up and be a man?

37:41.760 --> 37:43.728
Get yourself
to school on time.

37:43.795 --> 37:45.596
Maybe you can spend
a little time
with Keegan.

37:45.663 --> 37:48.165
Because you know what?
He's not sucking it up.

37:48.232 --> 37:50.402
He's gotta learn.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.319
Hey.

38:07.385 --> 38:10.321
Hey.

38:10.388 --> 38:12.190
Where were you
this morning?

38:12.257 --> 38:14.392
I was up late.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.927
Okay.

38:16.994 --> 38:20.197
I thought you wanted
to be the best.

38:20.264 --> 38:26.236
What's the point?

38:26.304 --> 38:28.439
You know your dad's
never liked me.

38:28.506 --> 38:30.876
Doesn't even want you
around me.

38:30.941 --> 38:32.811
Oh, come on.
We both know

38:32.878 --> 38:35.481
My dad cares more
about winning the
championship game.

38:35.546 --> 38:38.850
But it isn't enough
to be good, Conor.

38:38.917 --> 38:42.320
Maybe if you were
more of a team player,

38:42.388 --> 38:44.322
He would find a way
to use you.

38:44.390 --> 38:47.758
Wow. So, you're
taking his side now?

38:47.826 --> 38:49.595
Are you serious
right now?

38:49.660 --> 38:52.831
I have been on your
side since day one.

38:52.898 --> 38:56.667
Frankly,
I don't know what
your side is anymore.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.985
(Whistle blows)

39:16.887 --> 39:18.724
Sullivan, Douglas
is banged up.

39:18.789 --> 39:21.527
Get in there.
Left side attack. Yes.

39:21.593 --> 39:23.395
All right,
Briarfield, let's go!

39:23.462 --> 39:25.195
Come on!

39:25.262 --> 39:26.465
Hey, Sullivan!

39:26.532 --> 39:28.566
How you liking
that left side?

39:36.374 --> 39:38.175
(Whistle blows)

39:38.242 --> 39:41.413
(Overlapping shouts)

39:55.494 --> 39:58.063
Here, here, here!

39:58.128 --> 40:01.099
Come on!
Come on!

40:01.166 --> 40:02.400
(Shouting continues)

40:06.472 --> 40:08.706
Ref, come on!

40:11.442 --> 40:13.611
(Cheering)

40:25.156 --> 40:27.324
Conor, no!

40:27.391 --> 40:29.528
(Whistle blows)

40:29.595 --> 40:31.128
You're done.
Get out of my sight.

40:43.340 --> 40:45.511
You all right?

40:45.577 --> 40:48.647
(Indistinct chatter)

40:51.483 --> 40:54.085
*

41:42.366 --> 41:44.135
(Yells)

41:46.403 --> 41:47.606
What is wrong with you?

41:47.673 --> 41:50.240
Hey! Stop right there!

41:57.982 --> 42:01.653
(Sighs) Heck of a way
to start spring break.

42:01.720 --> 42:04.288
Any idea who
might've done this?

42:06.024 --> 42:08.492
Um, it all happened
so fast.

42:08.560 --> 42:11.161
I didn't...

42:24.742 --> 42:28.780
* in the light of the sun

42:30.582 --> 42:33.183
* is there anyone?

42:33.250 --> 42:37.756
* oh, it has begun

42:37.823 --> 42:40.290
* oh, dear,
you look so lost... *

42:40.357 --> 42:42.193
No.

42:43.861 --> 42:46.331
* your eyes are red,
your tears are shed *

42:46.396 --> 42:50.268
* this world you must
have crossed, you said *

42:50.335 --> 42:52.671
* you don't know me

42:52.738 --> 42:58.442
* and you don't even care

42:58.508 --> 43:01.445
* oh, yeah

43:01.511 --> 43:02.580
* you said

43:02.580 --> 43:05.684
* you don't know me

43:05.750 --> 43:11.456
* and you don't
wear my chains *

43:11.521 --> 43:14.291
* oh, yeah

43:18.396 --> 43:20.230
Conor.

43:20.297 --> 43:21.732
I'm going to bed.

43:21.799 --> 43:24.102
You're not going
anywhere, Conor Sullivan.

43:24.169 --> 43:27.138
* essential, yet appealed

43:29.073 --> 43:32.343
* you carry
all your thoughts *

43:32.410 --> 43:36.715
* across an open field

43:36.782 --> 43:40.686
* where flowers gaze at you

43:42.187 --> 43:45.223
* they're not the only ones

43:45.290 --> 43:48.626
* who cry when they see you,
you said *

43:48.694 --> 43:51.561
* you don't know me

43:51.629 --> 43:55.767
* and you don't even care

43:55.834 --> 44:00.437
* no, no, no,

44:00.504 --> 44:02.273
Sullivan!

44:04.809 --> 44:06.611
He doesn't deserve
that name.

44:06.678 --> 44:09.480
The kid has no idea.

44:09.547 --> 44:11.749
You wear glasses?

44:11.816 --> 44:13.451
No.

44:13.518 --> 44:14.752
Any prescription
medication

44:14.819 --> 44:16.353
I need to know of?

44:16.420 --> 44:17.755
What? No.

44:17.822 --> 44:19.324
Do you have
a cell phone?

44:19.390 --> 44:21.226
No.

44:21.291 --> 44:24.329
From this point on,
you do not speak
unless spoken to.

44:24.395 --> 44:26.630
Am I clear?

44:26.698 --> 44:28.533
You're coming with me.

44:28.598 --> 44:31.301
Like hell I am.

44:31.368 --> 44:35.072
Fine. Spend another
night in jail.

44:35.139 --> 44:37.675
Okay, okay.

44:40.846 --> 44:42.748
So, where are we going?

44:42.814 --> 44:44.449
The six nations
work camp.

44:44.514 --> 44:46.284
It's where we send
all the reservation kids

44:46.351 --> 44:48.319
Who can't get
their life together...

44:48.386 --> 44:50.355
Kids like you.

44:50.420 --> 44:51.890
Work camp?

44:51.957 --> 45:16.814
Like picking up
litter and shit?

45:16.881 --> 45:19.017
Get out.

45:29.426 --> 45:31.695
(Both speak
native language)

45:31.763 --> 45:33.497
Court papers?

45:33.563 --> 45:35.366
Didn't get that far.

45:37.869 --> 45:39.737
Weapons?

45:40.906 --> 45:42.572
Drugs?

45:42.639 --> 45:44.608
Pornography?

45:44.674 --> 45:46.778
What? No.

45:49.546 --> 45:52.383
I'm gonna frisk you
just the same.

45:52.450 --> 45:55.085
And this will turn
into a court case
if you're lying.

45:56.586 --> 45:57.789
Hands on the counter.

45:58.824 --> 46:00.690
Spread your feet.

46:00.758 --> 46:02.760
And your cheeks.

46:10.801 --> 46:12.870
Sit.

46:12.937 --> 46:14.739
I'll grab
your counselor.

46:14.805 --> 46:17.508
I am
his counselor.

46:17.575 --> 46:19.043
Yeah?

46:20.610 --> 46:22.280
Okay.

46:23.949 --> 46:25.615
Missionary Ridge.

46:25.682 --> 46:27.617
Think you can find
your way back in the dark?

46:27.684 --> 46:29.419
Shitfaced and blind.

46:29.486 --> 46:33.458
(Both speak
native language)

46:42.699 --> 46:43.969
(Thunder)

46:44.034 --> 46:45.735
Not that it matters,

46:45.803 --> 46:50.341
But would you mind
explaining to me
this whole thing?

46:50.408 --> 46:53.643
Do not speak
unless spoken to.

46:53.710 --> 46:55.313
Well,
where are we going?

46:55.380 --> 46:57.916
What are we
supposed to eat?

47:06.858 --> 47:08.993
You gotta be
kidding me.

47:13.731 --> 47:16.366
(Thunder)

47:18.035 --> 47:20.104
Jeez!

47:23.273 --> 47:24.876
You need to build
a shelter

47:24.943 --> 47:27.645
If you plan on
getting some sleep.

47:27.712 --> 47:28.947
It's impossible.

47:29.014 --> 47:30.614
(Thunder)

47:31.883 --> 47:34.986
Duke! Duke!

47:38.655 --> 47:40.824
Duke!

47:40.892 --> 47:43.061
Duke!

47:43.128 --> 47:46.932
* If heaven would
fall down from the sky *

47:46.998 --> 47:50.167
* and I'd walk right in

47:50.234 --> 47:53.703
* I wouldn't know
where to begin, no *

47:53.770 --> 47:57.875
(Lyrics indistinct)

47:59.945 --> 48:02.580
* what did I ever do

48:02.647 --> 48:05.782
* to deserve
to be kicked out? *

48:05.850 --> 48:07.885
* oh, oh

48:07.953 --> 48:12.422
* can you remind me?

48:12.489 --> 48:15.126
* or can we write
the songs... *

48:16.127 --> 48:17.827
Who are you texting?

48:17.895 --> 48:21.331
Joe?
Yeah.

48:21.399 --> 48:23.167
Any news
from your felon?

48:25.003 --> 48:26.870
I can't stop
thinking about him.

48:26.938 --> 48:31.409
But how do you
know if someone's
right for you?

48:31.476 --> 48:34.279
Obviously, I can't
ask my dad about Conor,

48:34.344 --> 48:37.847
And my mom's been gone
for so long.

48:37.915 --> 48:39.550
I just don't know.

48:39.617 --> 48:42.053
I guess you just have
to trust yourself,

48:42.120 --> 48:45.056
And if he's right
for you, you'll know it.

48:46.390 --> 48:48.325
Mm-hmm.

48:59.836 --> 49:02.473
(Coughs)

49:09.046 --> 49:11.416
(Coughs)

49:25.997 --> 49:28.199
(Coughs)

49:29.933 --> 49:31.801
Hey, home slice.

49:31.868 --> 49:35.106
How come you slept
out in the rain
last night?

49:35.173 --> 49:36.507
I got a great
shelter here.

49:36.574 --> 49:38.708
Why didn't you
come get me?

49:40.178 --> 49:42.312
Is it noon yet?

49:42.379 --> 49:45.483
I don't know.
Aren't you an Indian?

49:45.550 --> 49:47.618
Can't you look up
at the sun or something?

49:49.687 --> 49:52.490
Well, it's gotta be
noon somewhere.

49:52.557 --> 49:54.958
Well, you'd better
get started.

49:55.026 --> 49:57.294
Started on what?

49:58.928 --> 50:01.931
Knocking it down.

50:01.999 --> 50:03.000
Why would I want
to knock down

50:03.000 --> 50:05.035
A perfectly good shed?

50:05.103 --> 50:06.704
Don't you live
in this place?

50:06.770 --> 50:08.605
I've got my reasons.

50:08.672 --> 50:11.675
I don't even know how
to use one of those.

50:13.177 --> 50:17.415
This is gonna be
harder than I thought.

50:17.482 --> 50:20.984
Which is
your chicken-choker?

50:21.052 --> 50:23.554
My what?
Answer the question.

50:25.155 --> 50:27.491
Are you really
asking me that?

50:28.925 --> 50:30.628
You could've
killed me, man!

50:30.695 --> 50:32.130
Lefty. Interesting.

50:32.197 --> 50:34.699
One hand on the bottom,
one on the top.

50:34.765 --> 50:37.202
Swing over
your shoulder,
extend your arms.

50:37.267 --> 50:39.570
You get a lot more
power that way.

50:41.606 --> 50:44.075
This place is
a freakin' mansion.

50:44.142 --> 50:46.077
How am I supposed
to knock it all down?

50:46.144 --> 50:48.113
Board by board.

50:48.179 --> 50:52.049
Board by
ever-loving board.

50:52.117 --> 50:54.418
Am ambidextrous.

50:54.484 --> 50:56.754
*

51:02.859 --> 51:06.131
* you feel like a candle

51:06.197 --> 51:08.966
* in a hurricane

51:09.032 --> 51:10.867
* just like a picture...

51:10.935 --> 51:14.003
Be sure to extend
your arm.

51:14.071 --> 51:16.641
* alone and helpless

51:16.706 --> 51:18.208
* like you've lost
your fight *

51:18.275 --> 51:21.044
* but you'll be all right

51:21.112 --> 51:23.547
* you'll be all right

51:23.614 --> 51:26.117
* 'cause when push
comes to shove *

51:26.184 --> 51:28.718
* you taste what
you're made of *

51:28.785 --> 51:31.221
* you might bend
till you break *

51:31.288 --> 51:34.192
* 'cause it's all
you can take *

51:34.259 --> 51:36.227
* on your knees,
you look up *

51:36.294 --> 51:38.696
* decide you've
had enough *

51:38.763 --> 51:41.266
* you get mad,
you get strong *

51:41.331 --> 51:44.067
* wipe your hands,
shake it off *

51:44.135 --> 51:46.470
* then you stand

51:48.071 --> 51:51.209
* whoo, ooh

51:54.245 --> 51:56.580
* 'cause when push
comes to shove *

51:56.647 --> 51:59.217
* you taste what
you're made of *

51:59.284 --> 52:01.752
* you might bend
till you break *

52:01.819 --> 52:04.289
* 'cause it's all
you can take *

52:04.355 --> 52:06.757
* on your knees,
you look up *

52:06.824 --> 52:09.894
* decide you've
had enough... *

52:09.960 --> 52:13.330
(Man screaming)

52:24.974 --> 52:27.178
Get working.

52:32.183 --> 52:33.951
I have blisters.

52:34.018 --> 52:36.620
(Laughs)

52:53.338 --> 52:56.406
There's gotta be
a purpose.

52:58.843 --> 53:03.180
Crazy Indians got me
knocking down
a stupid shed

53:03.180 --> 53:07.952
'cause it represents me
breaking myself down.

53:08.018 --> 53:10.020
Yeah.

53:10.087 --> 53:13.190
So stupid.

53:16.226 --> 53:17.995
Why am I doing this?

53:18.062 --> 53:21.232
You tell me.
You're the one
who screwed up.

53:22.367 --> 53:24.668
When do I get
to go home?

53:24.735 --> 53:26.336
When you learn
your lesson.

53:26.403 --> 53:28.104
When's that
gonna be?

53:28.171 --> 53:31.975
When I'm finished
knocking down your
palace here?

53:32.041 --> 53:35.246
Kid, there's dozens of
buildings just like this

53:35.313 --> 53:37.282
Waiting for you
and that sledgehammer.

53:39.250 --> 53:40.584
What, Sully's
little boy

53:40.650 --> 53:43.019
Want to come out here
and take a swing?

53:43.086 --> 53:44.389
Temper is good.

53:44.454 --> 53:46.357
It's how you use it
that matters.

53:46.424 --> 53:49.360
When you fight,
you quit. Right?

53:49.427 --> 53:52.330
In life, in lacrosse...
You know you failed.

53:52.397 --> 53:54.163
You know you're not
gonna win.

53:54.231 --> 53:57.601
So, you throw a punch.
And you quit.

53:58.903 --> 54:02.907
Get back to work,
you little jerk-off.

54:08.177 --> 54:10.480
(Squawking)

54:16.086 --> 54:18.187
Is it 12:00 yet?

54:18.255 --> 54:21.224
Crazy Indian.

54:21.292 --> 54:23.393
Where's your sundial?

54:23.460 --> 54:25.962
Save it.

54:26.029 --> 54:28.333
You work,
I'll talk.

54:32.136 --> 54:34.904
You know,
I'm a full-blooded
Iroquois.

54:34.971 --> 54:38.776
This may sound
antiquated to you,

54:38.843 --> 54:42.746
But the Iroquois
banded with five
other tribes

54:42.813 --> 54:44.915
To form
the six nations...

54:44.982 --> 54:47.318
A participatory
democracy

54:47.385 --> 54:49.320
That lasts
to this day.

54:49.387 --> 54:52.622
I have no idea what
any of that means.

54:54.459 --> 54:56.494
A participatory
democracy

54:56.561 --> 54:59.797
Means that my people
got the vote

54:59.864 --> 55:02.900
100 years before
Thomas Jefferson

55:02.967 --> 55:06.671
Decided all men
were created equal.

55:08.305 --> 55:09.940
So?

55:10.007 --> 55:12.209
So, you couldn't be
more authentically

55:12.276 --> 55:14.679
And originally American
than that.

55:16.079 --> 55:20.050
So, the next time
you call me
a crazy Indian,

55:20.117 --> 55:24.822
I will personally
tattoo those words
to your forehead.

55:30.026 --> 55:32.863
Do I have to
remind you again?

55:32.930 --> 55:36.367
Do not speak unless
you're spoken to!

55:36.434 --> 55:39.036
I was talking
to myself.

55:39.103 --> 55:40.704
What?

55:40.770 --> 55:42.739
I'm pretty sure
this is illegal.

55:42.806 --> 55:46.377
So is destroying
a trophy case.

55:48.211 --> 55:49.880
Now, work!

56:08.798 --> 56:11.901
(Man shouting
in the distance)

56:17.073 --> 56:19.509
(Shouting continues)

56:24.415 --> 56:26.650
(Shouting)

56:46.202 --> 56:48.237
Heh.

56:48.304 --> 56:51.274
Permission to speak.

56:51.340 --> 56:54.210
Define "warrior".

56:54.277 --> 56:58.214
Someone who spills blood
on the field of battle.

56:58.281 --> 57:00.485
What about...
I know what
you're gonna say.

57:00.551 --> 57:02.186
But don't waste
your breath asking.

57:02.251 --> 57:05.122
Turf burns do not now
and never will count

57:05.188 --> 57:06.757
As spilling blood.

57:06.823 --> 57:09.927
I'm sure your dad
taught you all this.

57:09.994 --> 57:13.530
My dad was never
really around
to teach me much.

57:13.597 --> 57:17.200
Well, that's
too bad for you.

57:17.267 --> 57:20.570
'Cause my colonel
was there for me
in a big way.

57:20.637 --> 57:23.941
Let me tell you
a story.

57:24.008 --> 57:28.411
I left the F.O.B.
In a re-supply convoy

57:28.479 --> 57:30.948
To the other side
of Fallujah.

57:31.015 --> 57:33.484
You know what
we were carrying?
Ammo?

57:33.551 --> 57:35.218
Energy drinks.

57:35.284 --> 57:37.555
Gatorade and red bull.

57:37.622 --> 57:40.824
The bare necessities,
right?

57:40.890 --> 57:44.861
Then, all of a sudden,
we come to a traffic jam.

57:48.032 --> 57:51.035
Before I know it,
I'm hit.

57:51.101 --> 57:53.436
And the corpsman
takes one in the head

57:53.504 --> 57:57.107
As he runs to save me.

57:57.174 --> 58:00.244
And, I mean...

58:00.309 --> 58:01.911
We can't move.

58:01.979 --> 58:05.248
All of a sudden,
we're surrounded.

58:05.315 --> 58:07.184
End of story.

58:09.186 --> 58:12.356
Then your dad just
comes out of nowhere,

58:12.421 --> 58:14.859
Like the cavalry.

58:14.924 --> 58:17.126
You know what
he says to me?

58:19.195 --> 58:21.197
"I'll never drink
another Gatorade

58:21.264 --> 58:23.000
As long as I live."

58:24.535 --> 58:28.305
And somehow he gets
the medevac.

58:28.372 --> 58:30.774
He gets me out.

58:34.178 --> 58:37.147
He gets everybody out.

58:37.214 --> 58:40.950
I never knew a warrior
better than him.

58:59.536 --> 59:02.607
Duke: Well,
you're up early.

59:02.673 --> 59:04.741
Can't sleep.

59:04.808 --> 59:07.244
I could swear
I'm hearing things.

59:07.310 --> 59:09.478
Well, all right.

59:09.546 --> 59:11.815
Let's go find them.

59:13.417 --> 59:14.952
Find what?

59:15.019 --> 59:17.654
The noises.

59:17.721 --> 59:20.189
(Men shouting and whooping)

59:34.003 --> 59:35.606
Conor: So, that's
what I've been hearing?

59:35.673 --> 59:37.642
(Shouting)

59:42.847 --> 59:45.115
Some of those guys
are the counselors

59:45.182 --> 59:47.450
From the six nations
lacrosse camp

59:47.516 --> 59:48.686
Your dad signed
you up for.

59:48.753 --> 59:50.688
They come down here

59:50.755 --> 59:52.690
To play the counselors
from the work camp.

59:52.757 --> 59:54.792
Who are
the other players?

59:54.859 --> 59:57.560
It's just them.
It's real lacrosse.

59:57.628 --> 01:00:00.230
And, brother,
let me tell you... real.

01:00:00.297 --> 01:00:02.767
Your dad played here.

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:04.702
He was a counselor?

01:00:04.769 --> 01:00:07.672
Just a camper.
Hand-picked...

01:00:07.738 --> 01:00:11.241
For his love of
the game was pure.

01:00:17.481 --> 01:00:20.785
(Overlapping shouts)

01:00:22.152 --> 01:00:24.587
You know,
Milligan played at
this game, too.

01:00:24.655 --> 01:00:27.090
You didn't know that,
did you?

01:00:27.157 --> 01:00:30.427
He and your dad
played together at Navy
after that.

01:00:30.494 --> 01:00:33.630
They were cool until
a woman came between them.

01:00:33.698 --> 01:00:35.999
Milligan fell hard
for her.

01:00:36.065 --> 01:00:38.736
Your dad just
stole her away.

01:00:42.505 --> 01:00:44.040
My mom?

01:00:45.508 --> 01:00:48.278
My dad did that?
To a friend?

01:00:48.345 --> 01:00:52.750
You know, every great man
has a weakness,

01:00:52.817 --> 01:00:56.385
And Sully's...
It was Claire.

01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:01.291
I'm giving up
lacrosse.

01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:04.994
Why? Just because
your old man
wasn't a Saint?

01:01:06.696 --> 01:01:08.799
You don't get it.

01:01:08.866 --> 01:01:12.036
Every time
I pick up a stick,

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:15.604
Every time I hear
the word "lacrosse",

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:17.874
I think of my dad.

01:01:17.941 --> 01:01:21.144
You know, if I could
say something...

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:26.082
Let him run
in your veins.

01:01:26.149 --> 01:01:29.152
Let him
make you better.

01:01:31.722 --> 01:01:33.823
He was proud of you.

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:37.994
Don't forget that.

01:01:45.836 --> 01:01:47.838
Let's go.

01:01:49.473 --> 01:01:51.842
(Shouts and laughter)

01:01:53.609 --> 01:01:55.444
West coast.

01:01:56.847 --> 01:01:58.749
Duke,
how you doing, sir?

01:01:58.816 --> 01:02:00.384
What are you
doing here?

01:02:00.449 --> 01:02:01.718
Spring break.

01:02:01.786 --> 01:02:03.720
This is where
I learned to play.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:07.256
Briarfield made
the championship.

01:02:07.324 --> 01:02:10.060
Good for you guys.
Thanks.

01:02:10.127 --> 01:02:13.362
Come on,
be on my team.
Let's go.

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:20.805
Here we go! Go!

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:23.372
(Cheering)

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:29.879
All right, guys,
I found a couple more.

01:02:29.946 --> 01:02:31.782
This game's faster.

01:02:31.849 --> 01:02:33.716
Looks the same
to me.

01:02:33.784 --> 01:02:37.120
Heh. Ready?
Game on!

01:02:37.186 --> 01:02:39.456
Trash talk out here...
You lose a few teeth.

01:02:39.523 --> 01:02:41.792
(Overlapping shouts)

01:02:41.859 --> 01:02:44.127
Ha ha ha!
You see that?

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:45.661
Were you watching
the roll dodge

01:02:45.728 --> 01:02:47.264
Or were you watching
Joe getting burned?

01:02:47.331 --> 01:02:48.731
I was watching Joe
get schooled.

01:02:48.799 --> 01:02:51.535
Iron sharpens iron.

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.769
All right?

01:02:52.837 --> 01:02:55.138
Joe's getting awfully
sharp today.

01:02:57.706 --> 01:02:59.742
Two points down!

01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:03.112
(Shouting continues)

01:03:08.885 --> 01:03:10.554
Go! Go! Go!

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:16.425
(Shouting continues)

01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:25.870
Go! Go!
Ha ha ha!

01:03:29.272 --> 01:03:31.108
Ha!
Yeah!

01:03:36.712 --> 01:03:39.548
(Shouting continues)

01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:42.819
What the hell, man?

01:03:42.887 --> 01:03:44.321
Joe! Joe! Joe!

01:03:45.856 --> 01:03:47.524
Come on, man!

01:03:47.591 --> 01:03:50.527
(Shouting continues)

01:03:50.594 --> 01:03:52.362
Here we go, here we go.

01:03:55.664 --> 01:03:57.166
Really?!

01:04:00.971 --> 01:04:03.672
(Grunting)
Get off me!

01:04:03.739 --> 01:04:05.910
(Grunting)

01:04:18.655 --> 01:04:20.657
Nighty night.

01:04:20.724 --> 01:04:22.825
Let's go!

01:04:22.893 --> 01:04:24.962
Play on. Here we go.

01:04:38.307 --> 01:04:41.078
It's more than
a game, west coast.

01:04:42.446 --> 01:04:44.581
When are you
gonna learn that?

01:05:03.866 --> 01:05:06.802
Brooklyn: It's hard to say
if warriors are born

01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:09.539
Or if they're made
by circumstances.

01:05:09.606 --> 01:05:12.675
I know everyone faces
hardship in life.

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:15.379
It just seems like
some people

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:18.248
Are actually
made stronger by it.

01:05:26.023 --> 01:05:28.492
Brooklyn:
I thought you wanted
to be the best.

01:05:28.557 --> 01:05:31.495
Dad: Sometimes in life,
you just gotta
suck it up, son.

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:34.531
What you're doing
out there now
is not lacrosse.

01:05:34.598 --> 01:05:37.866
When I was your age,
I could go for hours.

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:39.569
Conor:
Think I don't do that?

01:05:39.636 --> 01:05:41.138
I never see it.

01:05:41.205 --> 01:05:43.040
Brooklyn: What is
wrong with you?!

01:05:43.107 --> 01:05:45.976
Mom: Why don't you
step up and be a man?

01:06:09.733 --> 01:06:12.036
Hey.

01:06:12.101 --> 01:06:14.570
This place is
starting to bore me.

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:16.672
Let's head back.

01:06:24.113 --> 01:06:28.117
So, I still
don't get it.

01:06:28.184 --> 01:06:30.919
Was this supposed
to be a metaphor?

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:34.358
Was I knocking down
the walls of my anger?

01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:36.693
I mean, what was I
doing up there?

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:39.129
You think too much.

01:06:39.196 --> 01:06:41.665
It's a simple
question.

01:06:44.068 --> 01:06:46.503
How do you feel
right now?

01:06:48.272 --> 01:06:50.873
Pissed that you
kicked my butt.

01:06:50.939 --> 01:06:53.143
Other than that.

01:06:54.278 --> 01:06:56.146
Honestly?

01:06:58.215 --> 01:06:59.882
Confused.

01:06:59.948 --> 01:07:01.785
It's about time.

01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:04.020
What?

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:07.891
I spent a week...

01:07:07.956 --> 01:07:10.959
Knocking down
a house...

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:13.662
So I could feel
confused?

01:07:15.631 --> 01:07:17.934
You spent a week
knocking down a house

01:07:18.001 --> 01:07:20.104
So you could feel
at all.

01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:33.650
Look, you're
on your own now.

01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:35.518
I'm not gonna be
able to be there

01:07:35.585 --> 01:07:37.486
To rein in
that temper

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:41.023
Or whisper words
of sweet wisdom
in your ear.

01:07:41.091 --> 01:07:43.827
You gotta
hold it together.

01:07:43.892 --> 01:07:45.928
Can you do that?

01:07:45.994 --> 01:07:48.864
Yeah. Sure.

01:07:48.931 --> 01:07:52.836
Well... That's
a resounding hoorah.

01:07:52.901 --> 01:07:55.672
You know, if I was
a betting man...
which I am...

01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:58.006
I wouldn't put a single
George Washington

01:07:58.074 --> 01:07:59.442
On your self-importance.

01:07:59.508 --> 01:08:03.011
Ahh...
that's just
the way I am.

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:05.848
Now, your old man...

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:08.551
He would've probably
done things differently.

01:08:08.618 --> 01:08:13.157
You asked me for the
definition of a warrior.

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:17.359
A warrior
gets the job done.

01:08:19.062 --> 01:08:20.729
That's all I got.

01:08:25.934 --> 01:08:28.904
Now get out
of my truck.

01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:31.506
Yes, sir.

01:08:37.011 --> 01:08:38.747
Hey, kid.

01:08:40.416 --> 01:08:43.519
For the record,
I'm rooting for you.

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:47.224
Thank you.

01:08:50.024 --> 01:08:52.127
(Starts engine)

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.109
Whoa. What's up, buddy?

01:09:06.175 --> 01:09:07.910
Man, you need
a shower.

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:10.546
I try.

01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:14.484
Mom... Is it okay
if I go see Brooklyn?

01:09:18.054 --> 01:09:19.622
Here.

01:09:22.057 --> 01:09:23.792
Wish me luck.

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:26.495
(Sighs)

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:34.203
(Playing classical music)

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:58.661
(Stops playing)

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:02.164
(Doorbell rings)

01:10:02.232 --> 01:10:03.867
(Resumes playing)

01:10:06.270 --> 01:10:08.238
Help you?

01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:10.039
I'm here
to see Brooklyn.

01:10:10.106 --> 01:10:11.708
I'm not so different
from you.

01:10:11.775 --> 01:10:13.376
You're never playing
for me again.

01:10:13.443 --> 01:10:15.811
But I'll play.

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:19.115
Anywhere there's
a couple of goals
and a field,

01:10:19.182 --> 01:10:20.983
I can find a game.

01:10:21.049 --> 01:10:22.752
I'm a lacrosse player.

01:10:22.819 --> 01:10:25.889
And that's one thing
no one can ever take
away from me.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:34.598
And, with all
due respect,

01:10:34.663 --> 01:10:36.933
Tell Brooklyn
I stopped by.

01:10:47.976 --> 01:10:49.612
Hey.

01:10:56.019 --> 01:10:58.388
*

01:11:02.224 --> 01:11:04.260
Brooklyn: The heart's
a funny thing.

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:08.765
It can break,
it can beat a little faster.

01:11:08.832 --> 01:11:12.000
But the most important thing
it can do is heal.

01:11:12.067 --> 01:11:13.770
And if you follow it,

01:11:13.837 --> 01:11:16.439
It'll lead you
where you need to go.

01:11:46.168 --> 01:11:48.004
(Beeps)

01:11:48.071 --> 01:11:50.306
*

01:12:10.193 --> 01:12:12.095
(Beeping)

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:14.063
Get up.

01:12:15.899 --> 01:12:18.000
(Laughs)
Where'd you come from?

01:12:21.505 --> 01:12:24.441
(Indistinct chatter)

01:12:24.508 --> 01:12:26.443
Oh.
(Laughs)

01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:29.111
I can do that, too.
Aah! Ha ha!

01:12:29.177 --> 01:12:30.447
Goal.

01:12:30.514 --> 01:12:32.180
That was cheating.

01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:33.450
(Beeps)

01:12:33.517 --> 01:12:35.151
All right.

01:12:35.218 --> 01:12:37.053
Oh!

01:12:38.388 --> 01:12:41.189
(Indistinct chatter)

01:12:41.256 --> 01:12:43.026
Here, take it. Oh!

01:12:51.401 --> 01:12:53.870
(Beeps)

01:13:01.276 --> 01:13:03.513
(Laughs)

01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:08.585
* will you feel
anything at all? *

01:13:08.652 --> 01:13:13.489
* if I kiss you
where it's sore *

01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:17.025
* if I kiss you
where it's sore *

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:21.931
* will you feel better,
better, better? *

01:13:21.998 --> 01:13:26.069
* will you feel
anything at all? *

01:13:26.135 --> 01:13:28.336
* will you feel
anything at all? *

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:29.973
(Beeps)

01:13:30.038 --> 01:13:36.111
* will you feel
anything at all? *

01:13:36.178 --> 01:13:37.914
Joe: Good, Sullivan.

01:13:40.883 --> 01:13:42.552
Nice to see you,
east coast.

01:13:42.619 --> 01:13:44.554
Nice to be seen,
west coast.

01:13:44.621 --> 01:13:47.524
Performing
your penance?

01:13:47.591 --> 01:13:49.291
How'd you know
I was here?

01:13:49.357 --> 01:13:51.660
Word gets out.

01:13:53.228 --> 01:13:55.798
If you don't mind,

01:13:55.864 --> 01:13:57.733
I invited some friends.

01:13:58.502 --> 01:14:00.402
Let's go, guys!

01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:02.539
Whoa!
There he is!

01:14:02.606 --> 01:14:04.339
The boys took
a little vote,

01:14:04.406 --> 01:14:07.443
And we decided
we could use your help
this next game.

01:14:07.511 --> 01:14:11.080
In case you didn't hear,
we're, uh...

01:14:11.147 --> 01:14:13.148
We're playing
your old school
for the championship.

01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:14.550
Thanks, Dupree.

01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:16.585
I won't let
you guys down.

01:14:16.652 --> 01:14:18.721
What's up, boys?

01:14:21.024 --> 01:14:24.092
Let's go, guys.
Let's throw some
balls around, huh?

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:26.195
Brooklyn: The beauty
of finding yourself

01:14:26.262 --> 01:14:28.797
And really knowing
who you are

01:14:28.864 --> 01:14:31.034
Is that it allows
the possibility

01:14:31.099 --> 01:14:34.203
For others to be a part
of your world as well.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:38.440
Hey.

01:14:38.508 --> 01:14:40.476
Heh.

01:14:44.346 --> 01:14:46.182
* do you

01:14:46.249 --> 01:14:48.283
* want to get to

01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:49.986
* know me?

01:14:50.053 --> 01:14:54.356
* every little thing that

01:14:54.422 --> 01:14:57.761
* makes me me

01:14:59.663 --> 01:15:02.865
* if you want
the best I've got *

01:15:02.931 --> 01:15:06.703
* it'll cost you
a little honesty *

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:12.008
* take a deep breath

01:15:12.075 --> 01:15:15.378
* and tell me what
you're feeling... *

01:15:15.443 --> 01:15:17.914
(Sighs)

01:15:24.419 --> 01:15:26.789
Hey.
Hey.

01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:42.938
What the hell is this?

01:15:46.242 --> 01:15:47.475
We need west coast.

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:49.212
Out of the question.

01:15:50.647 --> 01:15:53.617
We aren't asking,
coach.

01:15:57.385 --> 01:15:58.887
This isn't a democracy.

01:15:58.954 --> 01:16:02.225
He knows Sierra
better than any of us.

01:16:02.290 --> 01:16:05.894
Come on, you guys.
Get back to class.

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:11.200
Brooklyn?

01:16:11.267 --> 01:16:13.637
You need to find
a way, coach.

01:16:13.702 --> 01:16:15.704
This is a team issue,
Brookie.

01:16:15.771 --> 01:16:18.206
No. No,
it's personal, daddy.

01:16:18.273 --> 01:16:20.076
So find a way.

01:16:20.143 --> 01:16:23.045
Either Conor plays,
or none of us play.

01:16:23.112 --> 01:16:25.413
There's a national
title on the line.
We're a team.

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.150
Remember?

01:16:27.215 --> 01:16:29.284
Sullivan's a good kid,
and he's been
through a lot,

01:16:29.351 --> 01:16:30.786
But he's not up to this.

01:16:30.853 --> 01:16:33.322
And he'll take you all
down with him.

01:16:34.824 --> 01:16:37.226
Then we all go down
together.

01:16:38.695 --> 01:16:40.864
Big game today, dad.

01:16:43.166 --> 01:16:46.235
I'm sure you'd have something
inspirational to say.

01:16:50.338 --> 01:16:52.308
Well, guess what?

01:16:52.375 --> 01:16:54.644
I met a girl.

01:16:54.711 --> 01:16:56.979
She's beautiful, dad.

01:16:58.648 --> 01:17:01.349
And the best part is...

01:17:01.416 --> 01:17:03.986
She's Milligan's daughter.

01:17:04.052 --> 01:17:07.055
I'm sure you got
a kick out of that.

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:12.862
You should see
my right-handed shot.

01:17:16.799 --> 01:17:19.035
I miss you, dad.

01:17:24.674 --> 01:17:26.608
I'm gonna get it done.

01:17:26.676 --> 01:17:28.712
I promise you.

01:17:30.545 --> 01:17:32.981
(Cheering)

01:17:34.549 --> 01:17:36.885
(Overlapping shouts)

01:17:39.554 --> 01:17:41.257
Look sharp,
west coast.

01:17:41.324 --> 01:17:43.860
Respect the game,
east coast.

01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:49.531
You ready
to win this?

01:17:49.597 --> 01:17:51.399
How cute is he?

01:17:51.466 --> 01:17:53.202
He looks
like his father.

01:17:55.739 --> 01:17:57.206
(Whistle blows)

01:17:57.273 --> 01:18:00.676
Let's go!
Sideline, everybody!

01:18:02.712 --> 01:18:04.680
Gather up, gentlemen.

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:07.215
This is it.

01:18:07.283 --> 01:18:09.552
The national championship
is on the line.

01:18:09.617 --> 01:18:11.653
It's yours to win.

01:18:11.721 --> 01:18:14.490
Hands in, gentlemen.
Do or die.

01:18:14.557 --> 01:18:16.559
"Warriors" on three.

01:18:16.624 --> 01:18:17.660
One, two, three!

01:18:17.726 --> 01:18:19.562
All: Warriors!

01:18:19.627 --> 01:18:23.366
Let's go, baby!

01:18:23.432 --> 01:18:25.769
To the national high school
lacrosse championship,

01:18:25.834 --> 01:18:28.204
Courtesy of lacrosse-x.Com.

01:18:28.271 --> 01:18:30.706
This will be the first ever
national high school
lacrosse championship,

01:18:30.774 --> 01:18:34.210
Featuring the best
of the east...
the Briarfield warriors...

01:18:34.277 --> 01:18:36.880
Versus the best of the west...
The Sierra lions.

01:18:36.945 --> 01:18:38.815
Shake hands.

01:18:38.882 --> 01:18:40.682
The captains shake
as we get ready

01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:43.887
For the national championship
high school match-up.

01:18:46.255 --> 01:18:48.792
Dude. Midfield,
new team.

01:18:48.858 --> 01:18:50.794
Fresh start,
green hornet.

01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:52.796
What's Riggins
doing here?

01:18:52.862 --> 01:18:54.730
Late-season transfer.

01:18:54.798 --> 01:18:56.698
How sweet is that?

01:18:56.766 --> 01:18:58.600
You hear me, Sullivan?

01:18:58.666 --> 01:19:00.135
Did you say
something?

01:19:00.202 --> 01:19:01.703
Both teams at midfield
as we get underway.

01:19:01.771 --> 01:19:03.239
We'll have a chance to see

01:19:03.306 --> 01:19:04.740
If west coast lacrosse
is ready

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:06.508
For the national stage,

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:08.244
And whether they can overcome
the transfer

01:19:08.311 --> 01:19:09.779
Of their former
star player...

01:19:09.845 --> 01:19:21.723
Number 9, Conor Sullivan.

01:19:21.791 --> 01:19:23.725
All right, all right!

01:19:23.793 --> 01:19:25.428
(Shouting continues)

01:19:25.494 --> 01:19:26.830
Shot, and a goal!

01:19:26.895 --> 01:19:29.531
Briarfield goes
on the board first.

01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:34.270
Possession Sierra,
to number 14...

01:19:34.337 --> 01:19:36.305
That's Riggins moving
the ball up the field.

01:19:36.372 --> 01:19:39.408
Unchallenged
on the outside.

01:19:39.475 --> 01:19:41.811
And a nice save
by the Briarfield goalie,

01:19:41.878 --> 01:19:44.280
And the ball's out
the other way.

01:19:44.347 --> 01:19:46.282
These east coast teams
can move the ball well,

01:19:46.349 --> 01:19:48.150
And Briarfield's "d"
is doing just that

01:19:48.216 --> 01:19:49.751
With a diagonal
up the field.

01:19:49.819 --> 01:19:52.922
(Shouting continues)

01:19:56.224 --> 01:19:57.961
Go to 3!

01:19:58.026 --> 01:20:00.628
And a shot!
Goal, Briarfield.

01:20:00.695 --> 01:20:01.965
Late in the second quarter,

01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:04.532
With a 3-1
Briarfield advantage.

01:20:04.599 --> 01:20:06.169
Shot Sierra... score!

01:20:06.235 --> 01:20:09.072
All right, good finish!

01:20:10.706 --> 01:20:12.175
Let's do it!

01:20:16.578 --> 01:20:17.613
Goal, Briarfield!

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:19.948
Yes!

01:20:23.853 --> 01:20:25.753
Number 9... Sullivan...

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:27.690
Doing it all by himself.

01:20:27.755 --> 01:20:30.025
Sullivan scores!

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.063
This could be
a different game tonight

01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:36.464
If 9 were still wearing
the purple of Sierra.

01:20:45.942 --> 01:20:48.111
(Shouting continues)

01:20:49.545 --> 01:20:52.080
Sierra just needs one
to take the lead,

01:20:52.147 --> 01:20:56.251
And the later in the game
we go, the more the momentum
seems to shift to Sierra.

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:08.364
Oh, and a huge hit
by number 77!

01:21:08.431 --> 01:21:10.032
Next time,
take his head off!

01:21:10.098 --> 01:21:12.034
And Sierra's gonna
have a shot here.

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:14.036
We're under a minute,
tied at 9.

01:21:14.103 --> 01:21:16.605
(Shouting continues)

01:21:19.574 --> 01:21:23.311
Sierra working it around,
controlling the pace.

01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:26.749
They swing it back up top.

01:21:26.814 --> 01:21:28.316
Riggins,
stick somebody!

01:21:28.384 --> 01:21:31.219
They've got time
to set something up.

01:21:33.855 --> 01:21:37.625
And a goal! Sierra has
scored the go-ahead goal!

01:21:37.692 --> 01:21:41.064
Sierra has just silenced
this home crowd.

01:21:41.129 --> 01:21:43.831
28 seconds.

01:21:43.899 --> 01:21:45.001
This is embarrassing.

01:21:45.068 --> 01:21:46.936
We gotta tie this up.

01:21:47.003 --> 01:21:49.538
What you got in mind?

01:21:49.605 --> 01:21:50.940
You're captain America.

01:21:51.007 --> 01:21:52.874
Nah, they know
my moves.

01:21:52.942 --> 01:21:54.709
That's why we
gotta change it up.

01:21:54.776 --> 01:21:56.079
Hey, offense, get in.

01:21:56.144 --> 01:21:58.047
Come on, guys.

01:21:59.814 --> 01:22:01.985
Briarfield needs
a big play

01:22:02.051 --> 01:22:03.552
If they hope
to pull this out.

01:22:03.619 --> 01:22:04.920
All: Break!

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:07.023
Let's go, white!
Nice play, white!

01:22:07.089 --> 01:22:08.757
Come on, guys.

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:10.493
Come on, Briarfield!

01:22:10.559 --> 01:22:13.595
Here we go.
National title on the line.

01:22:13.662 --> 01:22:14.963
10-9, advantage Sierra.

01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:16.899
Captain America!

01:22:16.965 --> 01:22:20.436
Sullivan! Find Sullivan!

01:22:20.503 --> 01:22:22.370
The ball's down.
The ball's up.

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:24.974
Oh! Possession Briarfield!
That's Joe Bryant.

01:22:25.041 --> 01:22:27.342
The long stick is going
across midfield.

01:22:27.409 --> 01:22:28.910
He's looking to pass inside.

01:22:28.978 --> 01:22:31.779
Finds Sullivan.

01:22:31.846 --> 01:22:33.715
Sullivan with a great dodge.

01:22:33.781 --> 01:22:36.084
He cuts to the middle,
looking for his big left.

01:22:36.151 --> 01:22:39.187
Needs a shot.
No, he dishes back!

01:22:39.254 --> 01:22:42.924
Goal Briarfield!
There's no time on the clock.

01:22:42.992 --> 01:22:44.527
But we are not done yet.

01:22:44.593 --> 01:22:46.996
Hey, we've got overtime.
Don't get kicked out of this.

01:22:47.063 --> 01:22:48.930
You east coast guys, man.

01:22:48.998 --> 01:22:51.500
Talk about overrated.

01:22:51.567 --> 01:22:53.935
Did Riggins just
call me east coast?

01:22:54.003 --> 01:22:56.039
You are, aren't you?

01:22:56.105 --> 01:22:58.641
That's not captain America.

01:22:58.706 --> 01:23:00.576
It is over here.

01:23:00.643 --> 01:23:02.511
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,
by coaches' choice,

01:23:02.578 --> 01:23:04.980
There will be no overtime.
We're still in there.

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:09.084
The game will be decided
by braveheart.

01:23:09.151 --> 01:23:10.619
Why are we doing
braveheart?

01:23:10.686 --> 01:23:12.420
Before the game,
the officials asked,

01:23:12.488 --> 01:23:14.089
"do you want to do
overtime or braveheart?"

01:23:14.156 --> 01:23:16.459
You agreed
without asking me?

01:23:16.524 --> 01:23:18.126
I didn't know
a west coast team
would be that good.

01:23:18.193 --> 01:23:21.763
Let's go!
This is our game!

01:23:21.829 --> 01:23:24.067
All right, guys.
Settle down, it's not over.

01:23:24.132 --> 01:23:26.768
Come on, settle down.

01:23:26.834 --> 01:23:31.706
Gentlemen, the game is gonna
be decided by braveheart.

01:23:31.773 --> 01:23:33.008
Dupree, that's you.

01:23:33.076 --> 01:23:35.143
Not me, coach.
Bryant's hurt.

01:23:35.210 --> 01:23:38.114
But Conor's not.

01:23:40.948 --> 01:23:44.486
You know these guys
better than Dupree.
It has to be you.

01:23:44.553 --> 01:23:46.122
Sullivan,
you up for this?

01:23:49.225 --> 01:23:51.660
Okay, we know Sullivan's
looking for a fight.

01:23:51.727 --> 01:23:54.130
Find it for him.
Hit him, and hit him hard.

01:23:54.197 --> 01:23:56.565
Sooner or later,
he'll lose it.

01:23:59.068 --> 01:24:01.336
All right, let's do it.

01:24:04.607 --> 01:24:07.575
Let's do it!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:24:07.643 --> 01:24:09.144
The nets will be brought
to center field.

01:24:09.211 --> 01:24:10.879
This is sudden death.

01:24:10.946 --> 01:24:12.815
No time on the clock,
no time outs.

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:16.452
Simple rules. The first
to score wins the game.

01:24:22.625 --> 01:24:27.028
Ladies and gentlemen,
please join us on the field
for braveheart.

01:24:27.096 --> 01:24:28.696
Oh, I can't take this.

01:24:28.763 --> 01:24:31.766
We have to go.
(Laughs)

01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:35.571
Braveheart may be
a new development
for organized lacrosse,

01:24:35.638 --> 01:24:38.073
But its pedigree comes straight
out of the sport's history

01:24:38.141 --> 01:24:40.776
As a true test
of a warrior.

01:24:40.843 --> 01:24:43.078
No rest, nowhere to hide...

01:24:43.146 --> 01:24:44.979
Just man-on-man
sudden death.

01:24:45.046 --> 01:24:49.084
Who has the heart to
battle it out to the finish?

01:24:49.152 --> 01:24:51.120
Down.

01:24:51.187 --> 01:24:53.921
Too bad your dad's
not here to see
you lose.

01:24:53.988 --> 01:24:55.557
Don't worry.

01:24:55.624 --> 01:24:58.161
There's more than enough
of him here.

01:24:58.227 --> 01:24:59.994
(Whistle blows)

01:25:00.061 --> 01:25:02.231
Possession Riggins.

01:25:02.298 --> 01:25:04.899
Driving Sullivan
up the field.

01:25:04.966 --> 01:25:06.868
Left hand hold.

01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:08.035
No clean opportunity.

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:09.938
Come on, Conor.

01:25:10.005 --> 01:25:11.339
Fires. Blocked.

01:25:11.406 --> 01:25:13.808
First chance for Sierra
comes up short.

01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:15.710
And now to Sullivan.

01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:17.346
Come on, Sullivan.

01:25:17.413 --> 01:25:21.316
Sullivan looks
for an opportunity.

01:25:23.186 --> 01:25:25.553
And he's down. Riggins...

01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:28.657
Going back the other way.
Sullivan holding ground.

01:25:28.724 --> 01:25:30.493
Riggins lowers
his left shoulder,

01:25:30.558 --> 01:25:32.260
Tries to spin.
No movement.

01:25:32.327 --> 01:25:34.028
Sullivan denies.

01:25:34.095 --> 01:25:36.063
You can take him.
Come on, Conor!

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:38.301
Come on, get him!

01:25:39.601 --> 01:25:41.804
Riggins fires
from the outside,

01:25:41.869 --> 01:25:44.105
And shot blocked.
Easy save.

01:25:44.173 --> 01:25:45.940
Back the other way.

01:25:46.007 --> 01:25:47.875
Let's go, Sullivan.

01:25:47.942 --> 01:25:49.977
Ohh!

01:25:50.044 --> 01:25:52.046
Riggins lays into him.

01:25:52.113 --> 01:25:53.749
Get used to that,
Sullivan.

01:25:53.816 --> 01:25:55.517
This contest
is a bit chippier

01:25:55.583 --> 01:25:57.353
As time goes on
and tempers flare.

01:25:57.420 --> 01:26:00.054
Sullivan looks fired up
by the contact.

01:26:00.121 --> 01:26:01.623
Come on, come on!

01:26:04.727 --> 01:26:07.061
Sullivan hunting
for the game-winner.

01:26:07.129 --> 01:26:08.563
Working the right side now.

01:26:08.631 --> 01:26:10.666
Come on!
Come on, Sullivan.

01:26:10.733 --> 01:26:13.201
Lining up for his big left.

01:26:13.268 --> 01:26:15.504
Fires it!
A clutch save!

01:26:15.571 --> 01:26:18.006
You can't let him
take that, Riggins!

01:26:18.073 --> 01:26:21.443
(Shouting)

01:26:21.509 --> 01:26:23.979
Riggins gets past Sullivan.
He's driving.

01:26:24.046 --> 01:26:25.613
Take him down!

01:26:25.681 --> 01:26:27.550
Get him!

01:26:27.615 --> 01:26:29.116
A shot!

01:26:29.184 --> 01:26:30.853
Crowd: Ohh!

01:26:30.919 --> 01:26:34.088
His stick got tangled up
in Sullivan's facemask.

01:26:34.155 --> 01:26:38.125
The shot was wide,
but Briarfield may be
in trouble here anyway.

01:26:38.193 --> 01:26:39.295
You all right, son?

01:26:39.362 --> 01:26:41.062
Dad: Conor...

01:26:41.128 --> 01:26:42.798
Hope you score a lot
of goals tonight, son.

01:26:42.865 --> 01:26:44.532
But it's important
how you score.

01:26:44.599 --> 01:26:46.702
Never put yourself
above the game.

01:26:46.769 --> 01:26:48.871
Conor: I have to let them
beat on me and just take it?

01:26:48.936 --> 01:26:50.973
Duke: Temper's good.
It's how you use it
that matters.

01:26:51.038 --> 01:26:53.709
Dave: If you fight again,
you are off my team.

01:26:53.776 --> 01:26:55.778
Dad: Promise me that
you'll show humility.

01:26:55.844 --> 01:26:57.445
Duke: When you fight,
you quit.

01:26:57.512 --> 01:26:58.881
It's more than
a game, west coast.

01:26:58.946 --> 01:27:00.849
When are you
gonna learn that?

01:27:00.916 --> 01:27:03.752
Duke: A warrior
doesn't run from pain.

01:27:03.819 --> 01:27:07.456
A warrior
gets the job done.

01:27:12.527 --> 01:27:14.762
9, you okay?
If you can't continue,

01:27:14.829 --> 01:27:16.632
I'm gonna have to
call a forfeit.

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:20.536
Nah.

01:27:22.037 --> 01:27:24.071
We've got business.

01:27:24.138 --> 01:27:25.373
All right,
play on!

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.942
(Blows whistle)

01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:29.278
Come on, boy!

01:27:29.345 --> 01:27:31.847
Sullivan attacks, powers.

01:27:31.914 --> 01:27:33.416
Come on, Sullivan!

01:27:33.482 --> 01:27:35.318
(Grunting)

01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:38.653
Ride him, Sullivan!

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:40.622
Push him out!
Push him out!

01:27:40.688 --> 01:27:43.224
Riggins giving nothing away.

01:27:43.292 --> 01:27:44.793
Come on, come on.
Take the shot!

01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:47.796
Sullivan spins,
he's got an opening.

01:27:51.499 --> 01:27:53.802
It's in! It's in!

01:27:53.869 --> 01:27:56.939
Briarfield wins!
Briarfield wins!

01:27:58.807 --> 01:28:01.777
The first national high school
lacrosse championship

01:28:01.844 --> 01:28:04.780
Will go to the east coast
Briarfield warriors.

01:28:04.847 --> 01:28:08.984
Thanks for being part of
a great championship game.

01:28:38.881 --> 01:28:40.949
Congratulations
on the game, Conor.

01:28:41.016 --> 01:28:44.420
Coach, thanks again
for the second chance.

01:28:44.487 --> 01:28:46.455
I could say
the same to you.

01:28:48.122 --> 01:28:49.958
Great job.

01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:55.330
Good job, Conor.

01:28:55.398 --> 01:28:57.565
Coach,
congratulations.

01:28:57.632 --> 01:28:58.967
Thanks. You played
a hell of a game.

01:28:59.034 --> 01:29:01.302
Impressive...
Captain America.

01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:03.406
Nice right-handed shot.

01:29:03.472 --> 01:29:06.842
Yeah? Well, now I'm
ambidextrous, too.

01:29:06.909 --> 01:29:09.044
Way to go.
Your boys played well.

01:29:12.114 --> 01:29:13.248
Thank you, honey.

01:29:13.314 --> 01:29:15.983
Congratulations.

01:29:17.452 --> 01:29:19.621
Go ahead.

01:29:21.223 --> 01:29:22.289
You heading back?

01:29:22.357 --> 01:29:25.428
Unfinished business.

01:29:25.493 --> 01:29:27.095
Sergeant major.

01:29:27.162 --> 01:29:29.296
Hey.

01:29:29.364 --> 01:29:30.933
I gotta ask you...

01:29:30.998 --> 01:29:33.368
Hammering down
the house...

01:29:33.436 --> 01:29:35.904
Metaphor or not?

01:29:38.305 --> 01:29:41.108
Hey. Are you okay?

01:29:41.175 --> 01:29:42.511
Yeah.

01:29:42.578 --> 01:29:46.113
Well done, honey.
Thanks, mom.

01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:48.484
Hey, Sullivan.

01:29:48.551 --> 01:29:50.018
You got a minute?

01:29:52.219 --> 01:29:53.821
With all due respect, sir,

01:29:53.889 --> 01:29:56.357
I need a few minutes
with my family.

01:29:56.425 --> 01:29:58.093
All right. Nice job.

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:09.504
Brooklyn: It isn't easy
watching people you love
get hurt,

01:30:09.571 --> 01:30:11.138
And it's impossible
to replace

01:30:11.205 --> 01:30:13.007
Some things in life
that are lost.

01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:15.009
But everything I look for
in a person...

01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:17.512
Someone who stands up
when they're knocked down,

01:30:17.579 --> 01:30:19.414
Can work with a team,

01:30:19.482 --> 01:30:21.749
And has strength
and humility...

01:30:21.816 --> 01:30:23.851
Can be found
through this game.

01:30:23.919 --> 01:30:26.655
Maybe that's why lacrosse...
Or baaga'adowe...

01:30:26.722 --> 01:30:30.124
Is known by another
even older name...

01:30:30.191 --> 01:30:31.660
The creator's game.

01:30:31.727 --> 01:30:33.929
Native Americans
believe they play

01:30:33.996 --> 01:30:36.063
For the pleasure
of their creator.

01:30:36.130 --> 01:30:40.135
Sometimes I think that's
why we do anything at all.

01:30:43.438 --> 01:30:46.674
(Cheering)

01:31:04.425 --> 01:31:06.994
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise

01:31:07.062 --> 01:31:09.798
As we honor the memory
of lieutenant colonel
Sully Sullivan

01:31:09.865 --> 01:31:12.601
With a missing man
formation.

01:31:21.644 --> 01:31:23.410
You do your dad
a great honor.

01:31:23.478 --> 01:31:25.581
Respect the game.

01:31:25.648 --> 01:31:28.115
Hey, Sullivan,
give me your stick.

01:31:28.182 --> 01:31:31.619
You know what?
Today you're gonna
carry this.

01:31:31.686 --> 01:31:35.724
Lead us out.
Let's go.

01:31:35.791 --> 01:31:38.425
Let's go!
Let's get it
done, men.

01:31:38.493 --> 01:31:41.295
