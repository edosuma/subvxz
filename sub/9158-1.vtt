00:56.927 --> 01:00.920
- Kurt, can you hear me?
- Go ahead, Sean.

01:01.607 --> 01:03.040
At about 11 o'clock,

01:03.207 --> 01:08.201
right in the middle of that herd
of wildebeest. See him?

01:09.407 --> 01:13.605
- Now that's a good one.
- Let's go. Start out easy.

01:13.767 --> 01:16.281
OK, Pockets.

02:21.047 --> 02:27.043
This one must be a female, she can't
make up her mind which way to go.

02:51.007 --> 02:54.044
Tell Kurt to let her run a while,
wear her down.

02:54.207 --> 02:59.042
- Sean says give her some exercise.
- That's what we'll do.

03:07.127 --> 03:08.799
Tell us when you want her.

03:18.887 --> 03:21.845
Tell Kurt to take his time.
This is a mean one.

03:22.367 --> 03:25.165
Take your time, Kurt.

03:33.927 --> 03:38.045
Try her, Pockets, move in closer.
See what she's like.

03:42.407 --> 03:45.001
Watch her, Pockets. Don't lose her.

03:56.847 --> 04:00.317
The rhino got the Indian.
Swing around.

04:10.047 --> 04:12.242
Bring the first-aid kit.

04:15.687 --> 04:18.041
Are you trying to get a vacation?

04:18.207 --> 04:20.596
- He hooked me good.
- He did, at that.

04:20.767 --> 04:25.443
- Why didn't you shoot him?
- I didn't know he planned to ride with us.

04:25.607 --> 04:29.156
- You can fix that up, Pockets.
- Big Band-Aid will do it.

04:29.327 --> 04:31.761
- You all right?
- Want to stretch out?

04:31.927 --> 04:36.921
Leave him here. Makes it easier
for me to work. Room, please!

04:47.647 --> 04:49.717
Tough luck.

04:54.847 --> 04:56.644
My fault. I messed it up.

04:56.807 --> 04:59.924
- How is it your fault?
- I was driving, wasn't I?

05:00.087 --> 05:04.763
- The Indian could have shot him.
- You find him again, I'll shoot him.

05:04.927 --> 05:08.317
This tourniquet isn't working.
Better get him to hospital.

05:08.487 --> 05:11.047
- Get him into the catching truck.
- Luis.

05:11.207 --> 05:14.563
- Come on. Give 'em a hand.
- Hold it, buddy.

05:14.727 --> 05:16.080
Easy.

05:17.807 --> 05:19.445
Kurt.

05:30.367 --> 05:33.040
Calling Arusha Control.

05:33.207 --> 05:35.675
Arusha Control speaking. Go ahead.

05:35.847 --> 05:37.599
This is Sean Mercer.

05:37.767 --> 05:41.885
A man's been horned by a rhino.
He's bleeding pretty badly.

05:42.047 --> 05:47.838
Tell Dr Sanderson we'll be at Arusha
hospital in about five hours. Over.

05:48.007 --> 05:52.523
- Will do. Anything else?
- That's all. Over and out.

05:52.687 --> 05:55.360
That hole looks very bad.

05:55.527 --> 05:58.246
It don't look good.

05:58.407 --> 06:01.763
After we get out of here,
push on ahead to the compound.

06:01.927 --> 06:04.760
Pick up Brandy,
she'd want to be at the hospital.

06:04.927 --> 06:07.919
You'll get there as quickly as we do.

08:51.967 --> 08:55.482
- Arga! Where's Missy?
- In room.

08:55.647 --> 08:59.196
No dinner. We're going into town.
The Indian bwana got hurt.

08:59.367 --> 09:03.360
- Bad?
- I don't know yet. Get me some coffee.

09:09.767 --> 09:11.519
Come in.

09:14.527 --> 09:17.280
Hi, Kurt. You're back early.

09:18.247 --> 09:20.124
- Is something wrong?
- Ja.

09:20.287 --> 09:23.996
The Indian... Rhino gored him
in the leg. He lost a lot of blood.

09:24.167 --> 09:26.681
They are taking him into hospital now.

09:26.847 --> 09:30.203
- Must we hurry?
- I came ahead. There's plenty of time.

09:30.367 --> 09:34.724
Thanks for coming for me.
Help me with my zipper, it's stuck.

09:34.887 --> 09:37.117
Come over with me.

09:39.087 --> 09:43.205
How did it happen? Was it
the same way as my father was killed?

09:43.367 --> 09:45.597
No, we hadn't even put a rope on him.

09:45.767 --> 09:47.837
How then?

09:49.167 --> 09:53.922
It was my fault. I got too close.
The engine was spitting a little...

09:54.087 --> 09:57.636
I took the chance and the Indian
was the one that got hurt.

09:57.807 --> 10:00.799
You all take chances.
That's part of the job.

10:00.967 --> 10:04.118
I know, but I shouldn't
have taken that one.

10:04.287 --> 10:06.960
And to pull this thing up here...

10:07.127 --> 10:10.961
I'm afraid of ripping something...

10:11.927 --> 10:15.920
- Here you are.
- Thank you. I'll get a coat.

10:20.847 --> 10:24.806
- How long does it take?
- As long as it takes.

10:24.967 --> 10:28.516
You mean to tell whether
a man can live or not?

10:28.687 --> 10:31.042
Patience, my boy, patience.

10:31.207 --> 10:34.199
Sterling virtue. I wish I had more of it.

10:35.687 --> 10:40.522
All we can do is wait.
Just don't start climbing the walls.

10:42.847 --> 10:45.156
Who's got a cigarette?

10:46.487 --> 10:49.081
- It's yours?
- Thanks.

10:49.247 --> 10:52.637
- Which one is Sean Mercer?
- I am.

10:52.807 --> 10:56.277
- I hear you've got a job open.
- What job?

10:56.447 --> 10:59.200
They said in town
you'd be needing a man.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.517
You're in a rush, aren't you?

11:01.687 --> 11:04.155
Is he asking for the Indian's job?

11:04.327 --> 11:07.364
- He's not dead yet.
- I know that.

11:07.527 --> 11:10.883
I asked for the job
because I was afraid if I waited,

11:11.047 --> 11:13.686
someone else might get it.

11:17.527 --> 11:23.045
- You'd better get out of here.
- I'm not talking to you, I just...

11:23.407 --> 11:26.797
Kurt, take it easy.
When a fellow's hungry... Cut it out!

11:26.967 --> 11:29.242
Damp it! You can't whip us all.

11:29.407 --> 11:31.523
- I can try.
- Bring your lunch.

11:31.687 --> 11:33.757
What's going on here?

11:33.927 --> 11:36.725
I have a patient already.
I don't want any more.

11:36.887 --> 11:41.199
- How is he, Sandy? How's the Indian?
- Not good.

11:43.247 --> 11:44.999
Did it have to be the Indian?

11:45.167 --> 11:47.920
- What do you mean?
- We didn't arrange it.

11:48.087 --> 11:52.797
You seem to take turns getting hurt.
I wish it was someone else.

11:52.967 --> 11:56.562
You all have standard type blood
that's easy to match.

11:56.727 --> 12:00.242
- The Indian has to be different.
- He needs a transfusion?

12:00.407 --> 12:03.922
Plasma is not doing the job.
I need whole blood.

12:04.087 --> 12:09.081
AB negative is not very easy to find.
I'll have to call on...

12:10.087 --> 12:13.762
- What is that for?
- I was thinking...

12:13.927 --> 12:16.805
...you were in a little too much of a hurry.

12:16.967 --> 12:19.720
We are talking about blood type.

12:19.887 --> 12:21.843
Exactly.

12:22.087 --> 12:25.318
You mean, that is your blood type?
AB negative?

12:25.487 --> 12:27.079
That's right.

12:27.247 --> 12:30.239
Well, it seems the Indian's luck
hasn't run out.

12:30.407 --> 12:32.523
- If you're willing...
- He is.

12:32.687 --> 12:34.882
- I will?
- If you want that job.

12:35.047 --> 12:38.164
I don't want anything from you,
including the job.

12:38.327 --> 12:42.559
- You refuse to give him the blood?
- I didn't say that.

12:42.727 --> 12:47.755
But I don't like to be told.
You are going to have to ask me now.

12:47.927 --> 12:49.918
I ask you, please.

12:50.527 --> 12:55.521
I'm sorry, Mademoiselle,
but he's going to have to ask me.

13:02.887 --> 13:04.957
All right. I'm asking you.

13:11.367 --> 13:14.165
This is the way you ask?

13:15.567 --> 13:18.240
- Where do I go?
- In there. Tell the nurse...

13:18.407 --> 13:23.037
- Wait. Tomorrow...
- He won't be going anywhere tomorrow.

13:23.207 --> 13:28.076
When he's through with you,
we'll talk about that job.

13:29.047 --> 13:33.006
I'll think about it. Mademoiselle...
Where did you say to go?

13:33.167 --> 13:37.285
Second door on the left.
Tell the nurse to get you ready.

13:37.447 --> 13:40.917
- Who's he?
- I don't know. I'm glad he's here.

13:41.087 --> 13:44.636
Doc, how long before you can tell us
about the Indian?

13:44.807 --> 13:49.323
Two or three hours. In the meantime,
would you do me a favour?

13:49.487 --> 13:52.047
- Sure, Doc.
- Get out of here.

13:52.207 --> 13:54.801
Leave me in peace. Go have a drink.

13:54.967 --> 13:58.039
I think the Indian will be all right.

13:58.207 --> 14:02.359
- We'll be at the Safari Bar. Coming?
- On the way.

14:09.367 --> 14:12.484
Safari Bar. Yes, sir, they're here.

14:12.647 --> 14:14.877
Hello, Doc. How's the Indian?

14:15.047 --> 14:19.120
Did he have a tough time?
Everything OK? Nothing went wrong?

14:19.287 --> 14:23.121
- He don't say anything.
- Give him a chance and shut up!

14:26.327 --> 14:29.763
He what? Thanks, Doc.

14:29.927 --> 14:34.557
The Indian sat up, asked for a drink
and made a pass at the nurse.

14:34.727 --> 14:37.195
Thanks, Doc. We'll call you tomorrow.

14:37.367 --> 14:39.722
- Youman! Another round.
- Yes, sir.

15:45.447 --> 15:48.723
- Port!
- Port.

15:48.887 --> 15:50.923
- Starboard!
- Starboard.

15:51.087 --> 15:53.396
- Drop it!
- Drop it.

15:53.567 --> 15:57.446
- Breakfast at six.
- It's a challenge we'll try to meet.

15:57.607 --> 16:00.280
- Goodnight, everybody.
- Goodnight.

16:00.447 --> 16:02.358
Goodnight, Brandy.

16:04.967 --> 16:08.755
- Dead ahead, sailor.
- Aye, aye, sir!

16:10.287 --> 16:12.482
Goodnight!

16:18.567 --> 16:23.516
Before you go any further,
I should tell you, you're not alone.

16:23.687 --> 16:28.681
I waited for you. The house boy
was gone and it was getting late.

16:28.847 --> 16:33.637
Hi. I had to sleep somewhere
and I just picked a room.

16:33.807 --> 16:36.799
I suppose I picked yours.
I hope you don't mind.

16:36.967 --> 16:39.356
I don't mind... Who are you?

16:39.527 --> 16:41.165
- Anna Maria D'Alessandro.
- What?

16:41.327 --> 16:45.366
Anna Maria D'Alessandro.
And who are you?

16:45.527 --> 16:49.406
I'm Sean Mercer, but...
What are you doing here?

16:49.567 --> 16:53.845
- Trying to get some sleep.
- I don't mean that, I mean...

16:54.007 --> 16:58.080
- You didn't expect me?
- I sure didn't.

16:59.327 --> 17:04.037
- What's that for?
- I wanted to see if...

17:04.207 --> 17:07.994
...if I was seeing things.
- You've been drinking a little.

17:08.166 --> 17:10.964
No, ma'am. I've been drinking a lot.

17:12.967 --> 17:17.961
Sean, I wanna talk to you about
tomorrow morning. Don't you think?

17:18.926 --> 17:21.646
I wanna talk to you about tomorrow...

17:24.247 --> 17:28.843
- Is there somebody in your bed?
- Yes, there is.

17:29.007 --> 17:31.362
What did you want to say to me?

17:31.527 --> 17:36.157
I had something important to say.
Can't remember what it is.

17:36.327 --> 17:38.716
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

17:38.887 --> 17:42.766
Sean. Do you have some?
I beg your pardon, I didn't expect...

17:42.927 --> 17:45.077
He doesn't know who she is.

17:45.247 --> 17:47.681
- Why is she in his bed?
- He doesn't know.

17:47.847 --> 17:50.315
- I didn't say that.
- What did you say?

17:50.487 --> 17:52.876
- I don't know.
- That's what you said.

17:53.047 --> 17:54.400
- What?
- "I don't know. "

17:54.567 --> 17:57.035
If you don't know,
why did you say so?

17:57.207 --> 17:59.880
You get me mixed up, now. You said...

18:00.047 --> 18:03.244
Look, you don't listen.
Let's start from the start...

18:03.407 --> 18:07.036
Please, I had a long trip
and I would like some sleep.

18:07.207 --> 18:10.085
- Wouldn't you?
- I certainly would.

18:10.247 --> 18:13.398
No, no, no. Who are you
and why are you in his bed?

18:13.567 --> 18:16.798
Why don't we leave the whole thing
until tomorrow?

18:16.967 --> 18:20.642
She's right. We can face it
in the morning with clear heads.

18:20.807 --> 18:23.844
- Yes, she is right. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

18:24.007 --> 18:26.202
Goodnight, Sean.

18:26.367 --> 18:28.642
Thanks for the use of your room.

18:28.807 --> 18:32.516
I didn't have much to say about it,
did I?

18:32.687 --> 18:34.837
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

18:45.927 --> 18:48.441
Anybody want one of these?

18:48.607 --> 18:50.677
Black coffee.

18:52.967 --> 18:55.561
Morning! Good morning, Sean.

18:56.367 --> 18:58.323
- Jambo, Arga!
- Jambo!

18:58.487 --> 19:00.637
What have we got for breakfast?

19:00.807 --> 19:02.877
Bacon and eggs...

19:03.047 --> 19:05.607
My favourite, codfish cakes.

19:05.767 --> 19:08.327
Deep-fried with antelope fat,
I love it.

19:10.007 --> 19:12.726
- Isn't anybody eating?
- Please, Pockets.

19:12.887 --> 19:15.242
- Go away or shut up.
- Preferably both.

19:15.407 --> 19:18.365
He's not human.
To drink that much and not feel it...

19:18.527 --> 19:22.725
- We had a big night last night.
- You remember?

19:22.887 --> 19:26.118
- Sean. I'm going on the wagon.
- Why?

19:26.287 --> 19:30.485
I'm beginning to see things.
I thought I saw a girl in Sean's room.

19:30.647 --> 19:32.524
You saw a girl.

19:32.687 --> 19:35.042
That's what I said.
I thought I saw a girl.

19:35.207 --> 19:38.244
Pockets, you did see a girl.

19:38.407 --> 19:39.920
- I did?
- You did.

19:40.087 --> 19:42.123
Good! Now, I don't...

19:42.287 --> 19:44.357
- Well, who was she?
- I don't know.

19:44.527 --> 19:46.279
- Don't start that again.
- What?

19:46.447 --> 19:48.403
"I don't know. "

19:48.567 --> 19:50.922
- Sean, he just said...
- Please!

19:51.087 --> 19:53.442
Morning, everybody!
Morning, Pockets.

19:53.607 --> 19:56.804
- Look what I found.
- What's this?

19:56.967 --> 19:59.527
Cameras, lenses,
a real professional outfit.

19:59.687 --> 20:01.086
Your room-mate.

20:01.247 --> 20:02.919
- Professional?
- Photographer?

20:03.087 --> 20:05.442
Didn't a photographer write to the Indian?

20:05.607 --> 20:08.485
- From a zoo in Switzerland.
- Basle, wasn't it?

20:08.647 --> 20:12.276
Yeah, but...
that was signed by a man, I think.

20:12.447 --> 20:14.642
Well, go get the letter!

20:17.767 --> 20:21.282
Sean, what does he mean,
"your room-mate"?

20:21.447 --> 20:25.201
- The girl in my bed last night.
- Sean!

20:25.367 --> 20:27.039
I didn't know her!

20:27.207 --> 20:31.041
- What was she doing in your bed?
- I don't know.

20:31.207 --> 20:34.005
Here it is. It's signed on the bottom.

20:34.167 --> 20:35.839
A M D'Aless...

20:36.007 --> 20:37.918
D'Alessandro.

20:38.087 --> 20:40.840
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

20:41.007 --> 20:43.919
I don't think I have met everybody.

20:44.087 --> 20:47.966
We'd better introduce ourselves.
They call me Pockets.

20:48.127 --> 20:50.357
They tell me we met last night.

20:50.527 --> 20:54.406
I remember you. Who wears
the other half of your pyjamas?

20:54.567 --> 20:56.762
I do. My name is Kurt Mueller.

20:56.927 --> 21:00.124
I know you. I covered the Le Mans race
three years ago.

21:00.287 --> 21:02.847
You should have won.
That crash... Too bad.

21:03.007 --> 21:05.646
I don't know... He walked away from it.

21:05.807 --> 21:09.561
I'm Luis Francisco García López.
I don't wear pyjamas.

21:11.047 --> 21:14.756
And this is our boss,
Miss Delacourt. We call her Brandy.

21:14.927 --> 21:17.600
How do you do?
I'm not really their boss.

21:17.767 --> 21:21.077
They were my father's friends.
Now we all work together.

21:21.247 --> 21:25.160
I know of your father.
One doesn't work at the zoo long

21:25.327 --> 21:28.478
without hearing of Frenchy Delacourt.

21:28.647 --> 21:32.720
Kurt, Luis, will you help me
to check the motor on the truck?

21:32.887 --> 21:34.320
Yes, boss.

21:34.487 --> 21:37.877
- Will you have some breakfast?
- Thank you. Just coffee.

21:38.047 --> 21:40.766
- Just coffee. Codfish cakes?
- No, thank you.

21:40.927 --> 21:43.600
Miss... D'Alessander?

21:43.767 --> 21:46.839
- D'Alessandro. "Dallas" is easier.
- Thank you.

21:47.007 --> 21:51.444
- Did you sign this letter?
- Yes, of course. Why?

21:51.607 --> 21:56.442
Because A M D'Alessandro
sounds like a man.

21:56.607 --> 21:59.485
You mean because I'm a girl,
I can't do the job?

21:59.647 --> 22:01.319
I mean we've got trouble enough.

22:01.487 --> 22:05.400
Why not find out
what kind of girl I am before deciding?

22:05.567 --> 22:09.526
- I wish I had the time...
- What about Miss Delacourt?

22:09.687 --> 22:12.724
- She goes out with you.
- She was born and raised here.

22:12.887 --> 22:16.197
She can drive as well as anyone here,
except Kurt.

22:16.367 --> 22:19.598
She can shoot a gun as well as anyone,
except the Indian.

22:19.767 --> 22:21.758
- Can you handle a gun?
- No.

22:21.927 --> 22:23.599
Have you ever been hunting?

22:23.767 --> 22:25.803
- Have you ever been to Africa?
- No...

22:25.967 --> 22:28.959
Well, I'm sorry, Dallas,
about the misunderstanding.

22:29.127 --> 22:31.561
We're short-handed, there isn't time to...

22:31.727 --> 22:33.399
...take care of an amateur?

22:33.567 --> 22:36.923
That's what I was going to say.
I'm sorry.

22:37.087 --> 22:39.999
Well, I'm sorry, too.

22:40.167 --> 22:44.160
I hate to do this.
I would prefer that you wanted me.

22:44.327 --> 22:48.206
Here is a letter
from the director of the zoo.

22:48.367 --> 22:51.996
I have a slight premonition
the boom is about to be lowered.

22:52.167 --> 22:55.079
That zoo will buy
most of your animals this season.

22:55.247 --> 22:58.080
And they want pictures of the catchings.

22:58.247 --> 23:01.080
The boom has been lowered.

23:01.247 --> 23:03.715
How long will it take to get your pictures?

23:03.887 --> 23:08.483
As long as it takes to catch
your animals. I'm ready when you are.

23:08.647 --> 23:13.801
That's a funny-looking work outfit,
but suit yourself. We're ready now.

23:13.967 --> 23:17.323
- You won't give me five minutes?
- I can wait a few minutes.

23:17.487 --> 23:21.605
- Thank you. I'll be right back.
- I can catch up with you, Sean.

23:21.767 --> 23:24.281
What is it?
Did I say something wrong?

23:24.447 --> 23:27.245
- I don't know.
- Nobody knows anything.

23:30.887 --> 23:34.880
- Where are we going today?
- Manyara, I guess.

23:39.327 --> 23:44.117
Are you gonna carry her stuff?
Don't start in by spoiling her.

23:44.287 --> 23:46.517
Yes, bwana.

23:49.367 --> 23:51.642
- Jambo!
- Jambo!

23:54.407 --> 23:56.045
- All set, Brandy?
- All set.

23:56.207 --> 23:58.437
Let's get under way.

24:01.087 --> 24:03.521
Pockets. Don't wait all day for her.

24:05.167 --> 24:08.318
Yes, bwana! Yes!

24:23.847 --> 24:28.159
- Dallas, let's go!
- I'll be right out!

24:28.327 --> 24:30.887
Take my stuff, will you?

24:46.727 --> 24:48.843
All aboard!

24:51.367 --> 24:53.437
I'm coming!

24:59.007 --> 25:01.919
- Hi.
- I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

25:02.087 --> 25:04.442
Aren't we going? Let's go!

25:07.287 --> 25:09.198
- Where are we going today?
- Yeah.

25:09.367 --> 25:11.039
I said... Look out!

25:20.127 --> 25:22.766
I didn't see that darned thing!

25:57.127 --> 26:00.676
- How does the ground seem to you?
- Could be better.

26:00.847 --> 26:03.361
- Some gullies over there.
- Yeah.

26:03.527 --> 26:05.404
If we get after a good one,

26:05.567 --> 26:09.082
stick around and hold him
if I miss the first time.

26:09.247 --> 26:10.919
Will do.

26:11.567 --> 26:15.242
- Give me that pad.
- Is it OK if I stand back there?

26:15.407 --> 26:17.716
Stay inside, that ground's rough.

26:17.887 --> 26:21.641
I'll be all right. I like to be
where I can move around.

26:21.807 --> 26:24.162
You'll move around all right.

26:26.647 --> 26:30.435
- What did you say?
- I told them to take care of you.

26:30.607 --> 26:35.317
- Tell them I can take care of myself.
- OK...

26:37.967 --> 26:39.958
Maybe.

26:42.967 --> 26:45.435
Luis. Handle the pole.

26:46.967 --> 26:50.562
Pockets, you pick me a big one
and I'll make you eat it!

26:50.727 --> 26:53.799
Yes, bwana. I'll be very careful.

26:53.967 --> 26:56.561
Start out easy.

27:03.887 --> 27:07.323
Why don't they catch the big ones?

27:07.487 --> 27:10.479
The last one tried
to get into Sean's lap.

27:10.647 --> 27:15.163
Pockets thought he was coming through
the windshield and hit an ant-heap.

28:09.127 --> 28:12.437
Take this one, Pockets!

28:45.127 --> 28:47.925
Tell Kurt to let that one go.
The noose slipped.

28:48.087 --> 28:52.399
Herding car... Let him go.
Sean's having noose trouble.

28:52.567 --> 28:57.595
- Was that giraffe to your liking, bwana?
- Just get another one the same size.

28:57.767 --> 28:59.644
- What happened?
- What?

28:59.807 --> 29:02.162
- What happened?
- Nothing yet.

29:02.327 --> 29:03.840
Knock on it!

29:06.167 --> 29:07.964
Pockets!

29:14.567 --> 29:16.159
You'd better stay there!

29:51.807 --> 29:53.843
Take this one.

29:54.007 --> 29:56.601
Get ready to shake hands with him!

30:09.447 --> 30:10.926
All right...

30:11.087 --> 30:14.636
Slow down easy! Easy!
Slow down easy!

30:20.007 --> 30:23.966
Come on, hurry it up!
She's a handful of trouble.

30:32.007 --> 30:36.000
- Get enough room to move around?
- Oh, shut up!

30:39.327 --> 30:40.965
All right.

31:10.767 --> 31:15.124
- Well, how is it?
- Terrible. I feel sore all over.

31:15.287 --> 31:19.485
The best thing for you now
is a good hot bath. Come on.

31:19.647 --> 31:24.402
- Thanks, Pockets.
- I'll put your things in the main building.

31:24.567 --> 31:28.162
Brandy... I just want to say something.

31:28.327 --> 31:31.603
You might not think so,
but I had a great day.

31:31.767 --> 31:36.636
Only, I made a fool of myself.
I'm sorry, I apologise to all of you.

31:36.807 --> 31:41.517
I would like to stay, if you'll let me,
but I don't want to force you, so...

31:41.687 --> 31:44.565
...just forget about
the letter I showed you.

31:44.727 --> 31:48.402
If you want me to go, just tell me. I'll go.

31:48.567 --> 31:50.523
Thanks for listening.

31:56.447 --> 32:01.123
Well, gentlemen.
Who's going to tell her to go?

32:01.287 --> 32:04.757
Rhino, elephants, buffalo...

32:04.927 --> 32:07.361
...and a greenhorn.

32:10.327 --> 32:12.887
Well, if that's the way you want it.

32:32.487 --> 32:34.443
Mamma mia!

32:38.007 --> 32:39.599
Help!

32:51.167 --> 32:52.759
Help!

32:55.647 --> 32:57.717
Stand perfectly still. Don't move.

32:57.887 --> 33:00.765
- I think I can save you.
- Thank you!

33:00.927 --> 33:03.919
Get back! Back!

33:04.807 --> 33:08.356
- Thank you!
- OK. Get back!

33:13.007 --> 33:16.682
- What the?
- What's going on here?

33:16.847 --> 33:18.883
What's this Clyde Beatty routine?

33:19.047 --> 33:23.484
What's he doing to you, Sonya?
Poking a chair at you!

33:23.647 --> 33:26.445
Come on, get out.
You don't belong here anyway!

33:26.607 --> 33:28.757
Here, that's my girl.

33:28.927 --> 33:31.521
Pockets,
aren't you ashamed of yourself?

33:31.687 --> 33:34.599
Dallas screamed,
I ran in, saw the cheetah...

33:34.767 --> 33:37.759
It looked too good to pass up,
so I thought I...

33:40.447 --> 33:43.245
- I was wrong.
- I think you're right.

33:43.407 --> 33:46.797
- And stay out of here!
- Yes, ma'am.

34:18.607 --> 34:20.199
Hi, Sonya.

34:32.367 --> 34:34.402
Oh, nice!

34:35.367 --> 34:39.757
- Shall I give you a hand?
- I just want to file these letters.

34:39.927 --> 34:43.636
- Why don't you join the fun?
- I don't belong in there.

34:43.806 --> 34:46.525
I've had all the fun
I can take for one day.

34:46.687 --> 34:51.317
I've had bangs and bumps
on every part of my body, from...

34:51.487 --> 34:53.398
...from bottom to top.

34:53.567 --> 34:56.764
And I had a bath
with a cheetah and three men.

34:56.927 --> 34:59.885
So I think I'll just sit for a while.

35:00.047 --> 35:01.924
About not belonging...

35:02.087 --> 35:05.443
They decided that
if you want to stay, it's all right.

35:05.607 --> 35:08.246
I'm glad of that, because...

35:09.767 --> 35:12.725
You said "they".
Did you vote against me?

35:12.887 --> 35:16.084
I told you I thought
you'd be a damned nuisance.

35:16.247 --> 35:20.365
Yeah, you did. And I was today, wasn't I?

35:20.527 --> 35:24.122
You were. But at least you knew it.

35:24.287 --> 35:30.283
Nice speech, but I don't think
you can talk your way out of it again.

35:44.327 --> 35:48.286
- Hi. Care for some company?
- Yes, why not?

35:48.447 --> 35:52.406
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't.
We were rough on you today.

35:52.567 --> 35:55.923
- I had it coming.
- Would you like a drink?

35:56.087 --> 36:00.877
- Just sit down and talk to me.
- Thank you, Sonya.

36:02.927 --> 36:06.044
What'll we talk about?
My favourite subject?

36:06.207 --> 36:08.437
- What?
- Me.

36:08.607 --> 36:11.838
All right. We'll talk about you.

36:12.007 --> 36:16.876
I noticed today that when everybody
was wrestling with the giraffe,

36:17.047 --> 36:20.676
you were just sitting in the car,
laughing. Why?

36:20.847 --> 36:22.997
Because the giraffe was out there.

36:23.167 --> 36:26.159
- Why?
- The giraffe has spots.

36:26.327 --> 36:30.286
The zebra has stripes...
and the lion is all one colour.

36:30.447 --> 36:32.119
What are you talking about?

36:32.287 --> 36:37.315
Dallas, any animal that has spots,
stripes, or is one colour,

36:37.487 --> 36:40.081
any colour, I don't go near.

36:40.727 --> 36:45.243
- You don't like animals.
- I like animals, I'm just scared of 'em.

36:45.407 --> 36:50.879
But, Pockets, you drove right in
with all these giraffes around.

36:51.047 --> 36:54.517
- What colour is a giraffe?
- Mostly yellow.

36:54.687 --> 36:58.521
- What colour is a New York cab?
- Mostly yellow.

36:58.687 --> 37:02.965
I drove a cab in Brooklyn. I pretend
it's rush hour in Flatbush and...

37:03.127 --> 37:05.118
...in I go.

37:05.287 --> 37:08.085
You people, you're all crazy!

37:08.247 --> 37:12.559
Just gives me a chance
to do some of my old jokes.

37:12.727 --> 37:18.404
You said you'd had a great day.
What was it that you liked?

37:19.607 --> 37:25.204
Everything. The car going so fast,
the animals running...

37:25.367 --> 37:27.437
It seems...

37:27.607 --> 37:30.280
...a great way to make a living.

37:30.447 --> 37:32.802
Well, crazy, but...

37:33.887 --> 37:36.685
Pockets, tell me about things here.

37:36.847 --> 37:40.317
Who are these men?
Where have they come from?

37:40.487 --> 37:43.877
Well... You know about Brandy.

37:44.047 --> 37:46.242
And Kurt. Let's see...

37:46.407 --> 37:51.003
Luis, he's Mexican.
He started out as a bullfighter.

37:51.167 --> 37:54.159
He told us he was pretty good.
I never saw him.

37:54.327 --> 37:58.206
- Now, there's the Indian...
- The man who wrote to me.

37:58.367 --> 38:00.722
Mister... Little Wolf.

38:01.687 --> 38:04.963
Little Wolf! Wait till you meet him.

38:05.127 --> 38:09.643
His folks didn't know what they had
when they called him Little Wolf.

38:09.807 --> 38:13.561
- The Indian and I take care of Sean.
- Take care of him? How?

38:13.727 --> 38:16.366
Sean's Irish and he gets mad.

38:16.527 --> 38:21.078
If he takes his mad out on us,
nobody gets hurt. We don't mind.

38:21.247 --> 38:27.004
- Pockets, why he doesn't like women?
- Why doesn't he like?

38:27.167 --> 38:33.037
Dallas, I warn you, you are labouring
under a gross misapprehension...

38:33.207 --> 38:37.439
- But why doesn't he like women?
- He thinks they're trouble.

38:37.607 --> 38:42.283
Well, they are,
but who made him think so?

38:42.447 --> 38:45.439
Well, that's a long story.

38:47.087 --> 38:50.716
- He almost got married once.
- Well, that's possible.

38:50.887 --> 38:53.037
He brought her here for a visit.

38:53.207 --> 38:57.200
She hated the place, the animals,
everything and everybody.

38:57.367 --> 39:02.600
She tried to get Sean to leave.
One day, she got on her broom and...

39:02.767 --> 39:04.325
...just left town.

39:04.487 --> 39:06.478
She was a fool.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.202
You like it here, don't you?

39:11.367 --> 39:14.518
Yeah, I like it.

39:14.687 --> 39:17.485
I'm liable to like it too much.

39:19.007 --> 39:21.805
Sean's got a way of...

39:23.887 --> 39:27.436
You sure got it in a hurry, didn't you?

39:30.367 --> 39:33.200
Pockets, tell me about him.

39:37.247 --> 39:39.807
How does he treat you?

39:39.967 --> 39:43.164
- You saw us all day.
- That was working.

39:43.327 --> 39:46.683
You were with him a few minutes ago.
Was he nice to you?

39:46.847 --> 39:48.883
No, he wasn't.

39:50.767 --> 39:53.804
Well, lady, could be that you're in.

39:54.967 --> 39:58.357
- What do you mean?
- I mean that's good.

39:58.527 --> 40:01.758
If he were nice to you,
you wouldn't have a prayer.

40:01.927 --> 40:04.885
Pockets, will you speak English?

40:05.047 --> 40:08.756
- Bad is good, good is bad, I...
- OK, look...

40:08.927 --> 40:12.920
If a man falls for a woman,
and gets his fingers burned,

40:13.087 --> 40:16.443
so he won't be singed again,
what does he do?

40:16.607 --> 40:18.677
I don't know. Tell me.

40:18.847 --> 40:22.920
If he doesn't like you, he doesn't care
and he can be nice to you.

40:23.087 --> 40:26.716
But if he does like you,
he doesn't want to get in any deeper.

40:26.887 --> 40:31.438
So he acts mean. The more
he likes you, the meaner he acts.

40:31.607 --> 40:34.485
- Doesn't that make sense?
- No.

40:34.647 --> 40:39.562
Let's try a different way.
If you were me, what would you do?

40:39.727 --> 40:42.287
If I were you, Dallas, I...

40:42.447 --> 40:44.881
No, you wouldn't want me to answer that.

40:45.047 --> 40:47.641
Pockets, make sense! What shall I do?

40:47.807 --> 40:50.275
- Now you're making sense.
- What?

40:50.447 --> 40:53.359
You said, "What shall I do?" That's it.

40:53.527 --> 40:56.439
You're the one that has to do it. He won't.

40:57.807 --> 41:03.325
- That's simple, that I can understand.
- You know, I think you do.

41:03.487 --> 41:06.684
Come on. We've settled everything,
let's get a drink.

41:06.847 --> 41:10.123
Dallas, one thing,
please, don't make him too mean.

41:10.287 --> 41:14.280
- Why?
- I told you. He takes it out on me!

41:17.287 --> 41:18.800
What's so funny?

41:18.967 --> 41:22.437
We were talking about
that big giraffe you picked last year.

41:22.607 --> 41:24.359
What a mess!

41:24.527 --> 41:27.405
- He stepped over Sean.
- Landed on the hood.

41:27.567 --> 41:32.766
After all that trouble catching him,
we had to let him go two months later.

41:32.927 --> 41:35.725
- Why?
- We couldn't get him to Mombasa.

41:35.887 --> 41:38.924
His neck was too long
for the railroad tunnel.

41:39.087 --> 41:43.444
- Dallas, do you want a drink?
- No, thank you.

41:43.607 --> 41:45.359
- E Flat.
- What?

41:45.527 --> 41:47.119
E Flat.

41:52.607 --> 41:56.600
- I told you, E Flat.
- You'd better be good.

42:08.007 --> 42:10.999
At least I played it with both hands.

43:27.727 --> 43:30.446
Arusha Control calling...

43:30.607 --> 43:35.158
Arusha Control calling 505.
Do you read me? Over.

43:35.327 --> 43:38.205
This is 505. We read you, over.

43:38.367 --> 43:44.283
I have a transmission for you
from Dr Sanderson. Go ahead.

43:44.447 --> 43:48.156
Hello 505. Can you hear me? Over.

43:48.327 --> 43:50.841
Loud and clear, Sandy, go ahead.

43:51.007 --> 43:54.602
Sean, you can have the Indian back
in three or four days.

43:54.767 --> 44:00.319
I wish it was sooner. My nurses
are all worn out, dodging him.

44:00.487 --> 44:03.559
That's good for 'em!
The exercise'll keep 'em thin.

44:03.727 --> 44:08.482
If that Frenchman's up and around,
I'd like to talk to him. Over.

44:08.647 --> 44:12.117
The Frenchman?
Didn't he come to your place?

44:12.287 --> 44:14.357
He sure did not.

44:14.527 --> 44:20.636
He left here early this morning,
with £ 15 he borrowed from the Indian.

44:20.807 --> 44:24.846
- Where'd the Indian get £15?
- Borrowed it from me.

44:26.207 --> 44:29.438
Did the Frenchman say
what he was using the money for?

44:29.607 --> 44:33.646
No, just borrowed it and took off.
Over.

44:33.807 --> 44:38.358
I guess that's that.
Put the £15 on our bill, Doc.

44:38.527 --> 44:41.041
Tell the Indian
we're not sure he's worth it.

44:41.207 --> 44:45.120
I've already done both those things.
Over and out.

44:45.287 --> 44:47.721
- That's good news.
- Three or four days.

44:47.887 --> 44:51.004
The Frenchman took off.
Too bad, we could've used him.

44:51.167 --> 44:54.239
Better to work short-handed
than with the wrong kind of man.

44:54.407 --> 44:56.921
How do you know
he was the wrong kind?

44:57.087 --> 44:59.282
Didn't you hear it over the radio?

44:59.447 --> 45:03.076
He took £15 from the Indian
for saving his life.

45:03.247 --> 45:06.239
What kind of a man would do that?

45:09.807 --> 45:13.163
- Lafayette is coming.
- What are you talking about?

45:13.327 --> 45:17.320
The French blood bank
just turned in the gate.

45:30.687 --> 45:33.121
- Hi.
- Hello.

45:33.287 --> 45:36.597
The Indian said to tell you
he'd be back in a few days.

45:36.767 --> 45:40.476
- We talked to the doctor.
- Did he tell you I was coming?

45:40.647 --> 45:43.798
He said you borrowed £15
from the Indian.

45:43.967 --> 45:47.880
And he said he hadn't seen you since.

45:48.047 --> 45:51.835
- You thought I was going to skip out?
- You could have.

45:53.807 --> 45:56.275
I've got something to do first.

45:56.447 --> 45:58.802
Do you always carry that chip
on your shoulder?

45:58.967 --> 46:03.677
That depends. I needed the money
to get my rifle from the gunsmith.

46:03.847 --> 46:06.839
Without a rifle
I couldn't be much good to you.

46:07.007 --> 46:09.396
Question is,
are you worth anything with it?

46:09.567 --> 46:13.276
Why don't you try me and see?

46:13.447 --> 46:19.044
Kurt is a pretty good shot.
Would you like to shoot against him?

46:19.207 --> 46:21.277
I'd like that.

46:21.447 --> 46:24.837
- Bring your gun down to the range.
- I'd like to go.

46:25.007 --> 46:28.158
Me, too. Would an audience bother you?

46:28.327 --> 46:30.443
If it does, he won't be much use to us.

46:30.607 --> 46:34.805
- It won't make any difference.
- Hop in.

46:45.847 --> 46:50.284
- Hey, where are you going? Wait!
- Dallas, come on!

47:03.167 --> 47:06.364
All right.
Kurt, take the first bottle on the right.

47:06.527 --> 47:09.758
And you... What is your name, anyway?

47:09.927 --> 47:11.804
- Charles Maurey.
- Chalmo?

47:11.967 --> 47:15.243
- Charles Maurey.
- Never mind. Chips will do.

47:15.407 --> 47:19.320
You take the second one
and then alternate. Ready?

47:25.887 --> 47:27.525
Go ahead.

47:42.087 --> 47:44.601
There go my deposits!

47:46.367 --> 47:49.404
Now shoot what's left of 'em.

48:10.767 --> 48:12.723
That's pretty fair shooting.

48:12.887 --> 48:17.597
- He's faster than I am.
- A little.

48:17.767 --> 48:21.885
Reload, Chip.
We'll see how fast you really are.

48:37.167 --> 48:40.921
Well, it looks like you're going to work.

48:41.087 --> 48:45.000
I still have something to do.
May I have your gun, please?

48:45.167 --> 48:48.159
- Sure.
- Thank you.

48:52.767 --> 48:55.565
You still want me now?

48:59.927 --> 49:03.522
You got the job.

49:03.687 --> 49:05.678
OK.

49:08.007 --> 49:11.795
But you've got a strange way
of asking for it.

49:45.047 --> 49:48.039
- Kurt.
- Go ahead, Sean.

49:48.207 --> 49:52.120
Our motor's a little hot.
We're going to get some water.

49:52.287 --> 49:57.281
- Find a place in the shade and wait.
- OK, we'll be waiting for you.

50:37.447 --> 50:41.884
- Holy smoke! What on earth is this?
- It's a well, a water-hole.

50:42.047 --> 50:44.163
It belongs to the Masai tribe.

50:44.327 --> 50:48.639
Nobody knows who built it
or how old it is. 2,000 years maybe.

50:48.807 --> 50:52.595
You see how they raise the water
to the cattle.

50:59.487 --> 51:02.763
Funny thing, they'll work all day
getting that water up.

51:02.927 --> 51:05.760
But when it comes to repairs,
they won't touch it.

51:05.927 --> 51:08.521
They hire another tribe to do the work.

51:08.687 --> 51:11.679
They're cattlemen. Too proud to dig.

52:06.487 --> 52:10.321
Can't you get any more speed
out of this thing?

52:10.487 --> 52:12.478
Let's go, Pockets!

52:13.727 --> 52:17.606
Oh, nuts! Don't slow down,
pass me the line.

52:17.767 --> 52:19.997
Come on, hurry it up!

52:46.647 --> 52:49.605
Some day, Pockets,
I'm gonna wring your neck!

52:49.767 --> 52:52.235
Not today, bwana, not today!

52:52.407 --> 52:54.967
Just shut up and drive!

52:56.287 --> 52:59.836
We'd better get this one
or else he'll be awful mad!

53:08.407 --> 53:12.002
The Lone Ranger rides again! Yahoo!

53:25.727 --> 53:28.878
If he misses again,
stick your fingers in your ears.

53:42.247 --> 53:44.807
Slow down easy! Easy!

53:58.007 --> 54:00.475
Hold him! Let me see something!

54:07.087 --> 54:09.476
Hang on to him!

54:17.847 --> 54:19.838
Open the door!

54:27.647 --> 54:31.322
Kurt, get out of there. He's hard to hold.

54:31.487 --> 54:35.162
Come on out! Get the hell out, will you!

54:35.327 --> 54:36.999
Get up!

54:37.167 --> 54:39.727
Get him up!

54:45.447 --> 54:49.884
I thought he was going
to take you clear to Arusha!

54:50.047 --> 54:52.845
- You got another cage?
- No, thank you!

54:53.007 --> 54:55.999
Let's break out the beer.

55:08.887 --> 55:11.003
Cheeky!

55:13.967 --> 55:16.527
Chewy!

55:30.047 --> 55:33.278
- Bring him over here.
- OK.

55:33.447 --> 55:36.166
He knows the way.

55:40.767 --> 55:43.486
Come on!

55:43.647 --> 55:46.525
See how he likes it?

56:06.087 --> 56:08.806
- Want some?
- Brandy!

56:15.927 --> 56:17.645
- Good morning.
- Morning.

56:17.807 --> 56:20.526
I really twisted this thing yesterday.

56:20.687 --> 56:22.245
Yeah.

56:22.407 --> 56:25.717
What's the matter? You look liverish.
Too much sun?

56:25.887 --> 56:28.037
Sean, how old is Brandy?

56:28.207 --> 56:30.926
She's around... Let's see, she was 17...

56:31.087 --> 56:34.079
Have you had a close look at her lately?

56:36.487 --> 56:39.684
Holy smoke! She's all grown up.

56:39.847 --> 56:43.965
I noticed that the other night
when I was zipping up her dress.

56:44.127 --> 56:46.925
- When you what?
- Zipping her dress.

56:47.087 --> 56:49.601
All of a sudden,
I stopped thinking of her as a kid.

56:49.767 --> 56:52.076
- You did?
- I did.

56:52.247 --> 56:55.398
That Frenchman isn't looking at her
like she was a child.

56:55.567 --> 56:58.923
Anybody with two eyes can see that.

56:59.087 --> 57:01.760
That's why you're green around the gills!

57:01.927 --> 57:05.363
Spring comes to the bushveld
and the bucks start fighting.

57:05.527 --> 57:07.961
- So what?
- So...

57:10.127 --> 57:14.166
I can't answer that. But don't let it
gum up the work around here.

57:14.327 --> 57:19.276
I won't. But I'm not going
to give him a free hand, either.

57:19.447 --> 57:21.756
This is going to be great.

57:21.927 --> 57:25.397
The Indian's knocked out,
we're stuck with a woman photographer,

57:25.567 --> 57:27.683
now you break out in monkey bites.

57:27.847 --> 57:32.159
- And we're a month behind already!
- So what?

57:32.327 --> 57:35.319
So don't give him a free hand.

57:39.127 --> 57:40.924
Come on!

57:47.927 --> 57:50.077
Hey! It's the Indian!

57:50.247 --> 57:52.886
- Welcome back, Little Wolf!
- We've missed you!

57:53.047 --> 57:55.402
- Don't spoil him.
- Get the stretcher.

57:55.567 --> 57:59.355
- Comment ça va?
- Frenchie, you've got good blood.

57:59.527 --> 58:02.280
- We're blood brothers.
- Not till I give you some back.

58:02.447 --> 58:04.244
It's like carrying an elephant!

58:04.407 --> 58:07.160
Indian, this is
Signorina Anna Maria D'Alessandro.

58:07.327 --> 58:09.921
- Molto piacere, signorina!
- Piacere!

58:10.087 --> 58:14.444
- Where are you taking me?
- Bed. You're going to stay there.

58:15.367 --> 58:17.722
- Pockets stood in the chair.
- No kidding!

58:17.887 --> 58:20.720
All right, clear out.
Let him get some sleep.

58:20.887 --> 58:22.445
- 'Night.
- Thanks, boys.

58:22.607 --> 58:25.246
- Brought you some water.
- I've had that for days.

58:25.407 --> 58:28.683
- Maybe this'll help.
- That's more like it.

58:28.847 --> 58:31.680
Bring me up to date.
What's happened since I've been gone?

58:31.847 --> 58:36.682
Frenchman's working out pretty good.
Quick. Pretty fair shot.

58:36.847 --> 58:41.079
- Better than I am?
- Just as good. Moves fast.

58:41.247 --> 58:42.805
Go on.

58:42.967 --> 58:46.277
- We got a giraffe and a zebra.
- Go on.

58:46.447 --> 58:49.917
The Frenchman and Kurt
got a thing going about Brandy.

58:50.087 --> 58:54.842
- Well, good for Brandy! Go on.
- What do you mean, "go on"?

58:55.007 --> 58:59.683
That Italian import out there.
Who does she belong to?

58:59.847 --> 59:04.796
That Italian import out there
belongs to the Basle zoo.

59:04.967 --> 59:08.846
That's A M D'Alessandro. Next time
you write to a photographer,

59:09.007 --> 59:11.123
check what the initials mean.

59:11.287 --> 59:14.677
- How come you let her stay?
- I had no choice.

59:14.847 --> 59:17.566
- You haven't answered my question.
- What question?

59:17.727 --> 59:19.797
- Who does she belong to?
- Oh, Indian!

59:19.967 --> 59:24.722
If you need anything, holler.
I'll leave my door open.

59:25.767 --> 59:27.200
Sean.

59:28.127 --> 59:30.277
What about rhino?

59:30.447 --> 59:33.519
They say there's plenty of them
around Longido.

59:33.687 --> 59:36.804
- Don't do it.
- Why?

59:36.967 --> 59:39.561
Let 'em alone.

59:39.727 --> 59:43.766
First, it was that Belgian kid.
Then Brandy's father and then me.

59:43.927 --> 59:47.442
- This was pretty close.
- Too close.

59:47.607 --> 59:52.158
I'm beginning to think
we got the jinx on us about rhino.

59:54.567 --> 59:58.116
- That's just because you got horned.
- No, it isn't.

59:58.287 --> 01:00:01.165
Sure, I'm scared of 'em.
So is anybody with any sense.

01:00:01.327 --> 01:00:02.806
You're right, there.

01:00:02.967 --> 01:00:06.164
So just for this season,
let 'em alone.

01:00:07.247 --> 01:00:12.844
Well, we'll wait
till we fill the other orders and then...

01:00:13.007 --> 01:00:17.239
Don't lose any sleep over it
for a while. Goodnight.

01:00:18.447 --> 01:00:20.403
'Night.

01:01:04.687 --> 01:01:08.077
You didn't waste any time,
giving the Frenchman competition.

01:01:08.247 --> 01:01:12.559
Competition? She was kissing
Uncle Kurt for giving her a present.

01:01:12.727 --> 01:01:15.525
Has she thanked Uncle Kurt
that way before?

01:01:15.687 --> 01:01:19.475
- No, she hasn't.
- Some present! What was it?

01:01:19.647 --> 01:01:22.764
Oh, nothing.
One of those things women wear,

01:01:22.927 --> 01:01:27.079
with laces on it
and some stuff around...

01:01:27.247 --> 01:01:29.920
What business is it of yours?

01:01:30.087 --> 01:01:35.081
The Frenchman was watching.
You got him worried, anyway.

01:02:32.407 --> 01:02:35.922
- What's next?
- I was thinking of buffalo.

01:02:36.087 --> 01:02:39.716
Got an order for three.
A male and a pair of young ones.

01:02:39.887 --> 01:02:43.516
Semanjaro might be good.
I hear they are moving through there.

01:02:43.687 --> 01:02:45.405
Could be all right.

01:02:45.567 --> 01:02:48.764
Semanjaro's good country
for a lot of stuff we need.

01:02:48.927 --> 01:02:51.316
Ought to be good, because it's so dry.

01:02:51.487 --> 01:02:55.400
- Indian, do you like travelling?
- Sure, if I don't have to walk.

01:02:55.567 --> 01:02:58.400
Tell Arga to get the stuff ready.
We'll go tomorrow.

01:02:58.567 --> 01:03:01.764
- Enough for four or five days?
- That ought to do it.

01:03:01.927 --> 01:03:03.838
Dallas, no trunk.

01:03:04.007 --> 01:03:09.206
While I'm thinking about it,
no red shirt like you had on the first day.

01:03:09.367 --> 01:03:11.756
Why?

01:03:11.927 --> 01:03:16.364
Some people say animals
are colour-blind, but I don't agree.

01:03:16.527 --> 01:03:20.202
- I had a bull chase me once.
- Really?

01:03:20.367 --> 01:03:23.359
Sure it wasn't the other way round?

01:03:56.447 --> 01:03:58.597
- Hi, Stan.
- How are you? Good?

01:03:58.767 --> 01:04:00.166
Hello, Stan.

01:04:00.327 --> 01:04:03.364
- What happened?
- She was a wild one, a real rogue.

01:04:03.527 --> 01:04:05.677
Nearly killed a native three nights ago.

01:04:05.847 --> 01:04:08.281
You can see what she started last night.

01:04:08.447 --> 01:04:11.325
The family got out in time.
I had to shoot her.

01:04:11.487 --> 01:04:13.876
- Can we help?
- Have you a radio set?

01:04:14.047 --> 01:04:18.484
Could you tell headquarters
I'll stand by until they arrive?

01:04:18.647 --> 01:04:21.605
- Sure.
- Thank you.

01:04:23.487 --> 01:04:27.082
A calf. Did you know she had a calf?

01:04:27.247 --> 01:04:29.522
- Not until now.
- Poor baby.

01:04:29.687 --> 01:04:32.155
That's too bad.

01:04:33.847 --> 01:04:35.838
What?

01:04:38.567 --> 01:04:40.603
Dallas! Watch out!

01:04:40.767 --> 01:04:43.520
- That thing can hurt you.
- He's not afraid.

01:04:43.687 --> 01:04:46.599
You ought to be afraid of him.

01:04:46.767 --> 01:04:49.964
Well, Stan. It's up to you.
I don't envy you your job.

01:04:50.127 --> 01:04:53.358
We'll go on ahead.
I'll get your message to headquarters.

01:04:53.527 --> 01:04:56.963
- Come, Dallas.
- Let's get out of here.

01:04:57.127 --> 01:05:00.517
- I don't want to watch it.
- Watch what?

01:05:00.687 --> 01:05:04.600
- It's the only way.
- What are you talking about?

01:05:04.767 --> 01:05:07.759
That poor little fellow
hasn't been weaned yet.

01:05:07.927 --> 01:05:10.202
He's hungry, that's why he isn't afraid.

01:05:10.367 --> 01:05:13.200
In a couple of days, with no food,
he won't make it.

01:05:13.367 --> 01:05:16.564
Lions and hyenas...
Better to get it over quick.

01:05:16.727 --> 01:05:20.845
- You're going to shoot him?
- I'm not, Stan's the game ranger.

01:05:21.007 --> 01:05:23.475
- That's my job.
- It's not a nice job.

01:05:23.647 --> 01:05:25.558
- Come on, Dallas.
- I won't come!

01:05:25.727 --> 01:05:30.084
I won't come unless you take him.
He's small, we've got plenty of room.

01:05:30.247 --> 01:05:33.478
- How will you feed him?
- We'll find a way.

01:05:33.647 --> 01:05:37.083
If he's hungry, he'll eat. Shoot him
and you'll have to shoot me, too.

01:05:37.247 --> 01:05:39.078
Don't tempt me!

01:05:39.247 --> 01:05:42.125
You know, Sean,
there are lots of goats around here.

01:05:42.287 --> 01:05:45.006
- Goats!
- Goat milk is very nourishing.

01:05:45.167 --> 01:05:48.682
- You see!
- How many goats to fill him up?

01:05:48.847 --> 01:05:52.157
- What's a few goats?
- How will you get the milk into him?

01:05:52.327 --> 01:05:54.158
Posho would be good.

01:05:54.327 --> 01:05:57.444
- Mealie flour with milk.
- Like baby formula.

01:05:57.607 --> 01:06:01.646
What are you grinning about?
Put your two cents' worth in, Indian.

01:06:01.807 --> 01:06:04.958
- I was thinking...
- He's thinking you're gonna lose.

01:06:05.127 --> 01:06:08.836
- I am, am I? And you're all for it?
- That's it, bwana.

01:06:09.007 --> 01:06:12.238
Fine. You go get the goats,
I'll go ahead and make camp.

01:06:12.407 --> 01:06:16.798
All you have to do is get the goats
and an elephant into the cars.

01:06:16.967 --> 01:06:20.846
In your spare time, figure how to get
the milk into the elephant.

01:06:21.007 --> 01:06:25.558
I'm going on to camp.
See you there, if you ever make it.

01:06:28.327 --> 01:06:30.443
Well? What do we do?

01:06:30.607 --> 01:06:36.364
First, we take up a collection for
the United Elephant Fund: $2 each.

01:06:36.527 --> 01:06:41.442
I'll negotiate for the goats
while you get 'em all in the cars.

01:06:41.607 --> 01:06:45.805
That's it! That's it!
Everybody contributes. See you later.

01:07:19.407 --> 01:07:23.082
- You missed a lot of fun.
- Getting the elephant into the car?

01:07:23.247 --> 01:07:25.807
That was easy.
Trouble was with the goats.

01:07:25.967 --> 01:07:29.357
- Elephants and goats don't mix.
- How about the elephant?

01:07:29.527 --> 01:07:32.439
Dallas climbed into the car
and he followed. Look.

01:07:32.607 --> 01:07:34.404
Come, Tembo!

01:07:34.567 --> 01:07:37.035
Take him out of here
while we get some milk.

01:07:37.207 --> 01:07:38.799
He's getting hungry.

01:07:38.967 --> 01:07:42.403
Brandy, find me some pails
to put some milk in, ja?

01:07:42.567 --> 01:07:44.000
OK, Kurt.

01:07:44.167 --> 01:07:47.284
Well, boys. Let's unload the goats.

01:07:58.687 --> 01:08:00.803
Hey! Get them, boys!

01:08:00.967 --> 01:08:03.083
I'll get this one right here!

01:08:03.687 --> 01:08:06.599
Tembo! Come back!

01:08:11.607 --> 01:08:13.962
Now, get him over here.

01:08:15.927 --> 01:08:18.760
Come on. Get him out of here!

01:08:23.247 --> 01:08:25.886
Think this is a mess?
Wait till they milk 'em!

01:08:26.046 --> 01:08:28.277
It won't be easy!

01:08:32.846 --> 01:08:34.917
Quiet, Tembo.

01:08:43.046 --> 01:08:47.404
- Pockets! What are you trying to do?
- I'm trying to milk this goat.

01:08:47.567 --> 01:08:51.446
That's the wrong kind of goat. It's a ram!

01:08:56.127 --> 01:08:59.358
Come on, I'll show you. Turn around.

01:09:09.087 --> 01:09:12.283
- That's the way you do it?
- That's the way.

01:09:14.527 --> 01:09:18.520
Quiet, Tembo.
They're getting the milk for you.

01:09:33.527 --> 01:09:35.596
Now, hold it quiet, so I can...

01:09:37.167 --> 01:09:39.727
Stand still, baby. Good...

01:09:41.966 --> 01:09:45.515
- That doesn't get us anywhere.
- We are just wasting milk.

01:09:45.687 --> 01:09:48.564
- A goat only gives so much a day.
- He must eat!

01:09:48.727 --> 01:09:52.606
Don't look at me!
Feeding him is up to you people.

01:09:52.767 --> 01:09:54.803
So start thinking.

01:09:54.967 --> 01:09:59.165
Wait, if we take a radiator hose
and shove it down...

01:10:00.807 --> 01:10:03.924
...take a radiator hose
and shove it down his throat.

01:10:04.087 --> 01:10:06.760
- Then pour the milk in?
- You'll strangle him.

01:10:06.927 --> 01:10:09.725
Maybe if we cut a hole
in the bottom of a bucket.

01:10:09.887 --> 01:10:12.401
Yeah, but it's still...

01:10:13.327 --> 01:10:15.283
Oh, shut up!

01:10:15.447 --> 01:10:17.961
He still has to swallow,
now he just chokes.

01:10:18.127 --> 01:10:20.846
I seem to remember you started all this.

01:10:21.007 --> 01:10:22.281
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:10:22.447 --> 01:10:26.963
- You're confused. I just went along.
- Well, think of something!

01:10:27.127 --> 01:10:30.961
I'm trying. If he'd shut up for a minute,
I might be able to...

01:10:31.127 --> 01:10:33.687
Hey, he's not yelling.

01:10:34.887 --> 01:10:37.321
That's the way, Tembo. Easy!

01:10:37.487 --> 01:10:40.524
Yes. Oh, that's good!

01:10:40.687 --> 01:10:42.598
Wonderful!

01:10:42.767 --> 01:10:45.156
Yes, Tembo. Here!

01:10:46.287 --> 01:10:48.755
Yes... No, stop it.

01:10:48.927 --> 01:10:50.997
That's good!

01:10:51.927 --> 01:10:54.999
It's easy. I just thought,
"How do you feed a baby?"

01:10:55.167 --> 01:10:59.160
They never begin by pouring stuff
into them out of a bucket.

01:10:59.327 --> 01:11:01.397
Here! Here, Tembo.

01:11:01.567 --> 01:11:03.364
Oh, that's nice!

01:11:09.887 --> 01:11:11.639
We ought to try Longido.

01:11:11.807 --> 01:11:15.083
Seven Sisters is on the way.
We might find them there.

01:11:15.247 --> 01:11:16.965
- Hi, Brandy.
- Hi.

01:11:17.127 --> 01:11:20.676
Come on. Let's see
which one has to go to work.

01:11:24.727 --> 01:11:26.922
Go on, Chips. Take a straw.

01:11:27.087 --> 01:11:29.806
I don't understand. What is this for?

01:11:29.967 --> 01:11:33.198
Oh, I forgot.
I'm going to the river to take a bath.

01:11:33.367 --> 01:11:35.722
I can't carry a gun
and take a bath, too,

01:11:35.887 --> 01:11:40.358
so someone has to come with me -
whoever gets the short straw!

01:11:40.527 --> 01:11:43.325
- Not with this leg, Brandy.
- OK.

01:11:43.487 --> 01:11:47.162
We've been doing this
since she's been this high.

01:11:47.327 --> 01:11:51.081
- I have the short straw, Brandy.
- Let's go.

01:12:00.367 --> 01:12:02.483
Sean, tell me something.

01:12:02.647 --> 01:12:06.356
When we all drew straws
to see who'd go with Brandy,

01:12:06.527 --> 01:12:08.643
you didn't have a short straw.

01:12:08.807 --> 01:12:10.684
- I know it.
- Why did you say you did?

01:12:10.847 --> 01:12:16.444
Didn't you tell me you'd discovered
that Brandy was all grown up?

01:12:16.607 --> 01:12:20.646
That Frenchman doesn't look at her
like she's a schoolgirl.

01:12:20.807 --> 01:12:23.958
- And I'm not so sure about Pockets.
- Three of us.

01:12:24.127 --> 01:12:29.326
So I figured I'd better be the one.
I still think of her as a kid.

01:12:29.487 --> 01:12:31.443
All right, Papa.

01:12:32.527 --> 01:12:35.485
Can I give you a little warning?

01:12:35.647 --> 01:12:40.038
It isn't exactly a fatherly gleam
in your eye when you look at Dallas.

01:12:40.207 --> 01:12:43.404
- Oh, stop it!
- Don't act innocent with me.

01:12:43.567 --> 01:12:48.925
Do you want me to answer this letter
from the San Diego zoo?

01:12:49.087 --> 01:12:51.078
- All right, I'll do it.
- Do what?

01:12:51.247 --> 01:12:53.636
Answer the letter
from the San Diego zoo.

01:12:53.807 --> 01:12:55.718
Oh, sure!

01:12:59.047 --> 01:13:03.563
I've run out of cigarettes.
I'll get some in my tent.

01:13:05.967 --> 01:13:08.686
- Hey, Pockets!
- Hi!

01:13:10.127 --> 01:13:15.485
- I thought you'd turned in.
- Got a minute?

01:13:15.647 --> 01:13:19.925
Did Sean have anything more to say
about the baby elephant?

01:13:20.087 --> 01:13:23.875
He didn't want to see it shot
any more than you did.

01:13:24.047 --> 01:13:26.720
- Where is it?
- It's a he, Pockets.

01:13:26.887 --> 01:13:29.321
I've been mixed up once before today.

01:13:29.487 --> 01:13:33.560
He's tied up over there,
under the trees. He's asleep.

01:13:33.727 --> 01:13:37.003
Don't miss his two o'clock feeding.
He'll start squalling.

01:13:37.167 --> 01:13:39.078
Sean wouldn't like that!

01:13:39.247 --> 01:13:42.364
And you can't walk the floor
with him, either!

01:13:42.527 --> 01:13:45.963
By the way, how are you doing
with the big bwana?

01:13:46.127 --> 01:13:50.598
I don't know. You heard him today.
He would like to shoot me, he said.

01:13:50.767 --> 01:13:53.440
I know. I thought it was a good sign.

01:13:53.607 --> 01:13:58.601
Good sign! If he really
gets to like me, I'm in danger!

01:14:00.647 --> 01:14:06.836
Remember, he won't start anything.
You're gonna have to do it! Ciao!

01:14:07.007 --> 01:14:08.599
Ciao.

01:14:11.967 --> 01:14:13.958
Well...

01:14:14.127 --> 01:14:16.960
Now is as good a time as any!

01:14:18.047 --> 01:14:19.958
All right, see you in the morning.

01:14:20.127 --> 01:14:21.799
- Hi, Kurt.
- 'Night, Dallas.

01:14:21.967 --> 01:14:24.003
Watch it, Papa.

01:14:24.887 --> 01:14:27.606
- Hi, Sean.
- Hello, Dallas.

01:14:28.647 --> 01:14:32.162
I wanted to thank you
for letting me keep the elephant.

01:14:32.327 --> 01:14:36.843
Why me? There were a lot of other
people on your side. Thank them.

01:14:37.007 --> 01:14:41.364
Well, I'm sorry there was
so much trouble about the goats and...

01:14:41.527 --> 01:14:43.279
That couldn't be helped.

01:14:43.447 --> 01:14:47.235
Pockets trying to milk that ram
made it worthwhile!

01:14:47.407 --> 01:14:50.843
- Dallas, will you have a drink?
- No, thank you.

01:14:51.007 --> 01:14:53.475
This is the first time
you've been nice to me.

01:14:53.647 --> 01:14:56.207
I was almost afraid to come in here.

01:14:56.367 --> 01:14:59.120
Well, why did you come?

01:15:00.407 --> 01:15:04.480
- I wanted to ask you a question.
- Go ahead.

01:15:08.047 --> 01:15:09.639
Sean...

01:15:09.807 --> 01:15:13.482
- How do you like to kiss?
- How do I like to kiss?

01:15:13.647 --> 01:15:17.162
- That's what I said.
- What are you talking about?

01:15:17.327 --> 01:15:22.481
The kiss. You know the kiss.
How do you like it? Slow? Quick?

01:15:22.647 --> 01:15:25.844
Do you like to kiss the girl,
or the girl to kiss you?

01:15:26.007 --> 01:15:27.645
- That's silly!
- Silly?

01:15:27.807 --> 01:15:30.844
I ask how you like to kiss,
and you say it's silly?

01:15:31.007 --> 01:15:34.158
- Have you never been kissed before?
- Of course I have.

01:15:34.327 --> 01:15:36.318
Then why do you say it's silly?

01:15:36.487 --> 01:15:39.365
It's silly to stand here and talk about it.

01:15:39.527 --> 01:15:44.078
Of course it's silly to talk about it.
Let's do it. I'll show you.

01:15:44.247 --> 01:15:45.566
You like this?

01:15:45.727 --> 01:15:50.084
- There's a lot of people...
- Or slow, like this?

01:15:55.927 --> 01:16:00.079
I think you like slow better.
Wanna try again to make sure?

01:16:00.247 --> 01:16:04.001
Dallas, I've taken
about all of this I'm gonna take.

01:16:04.167 --> 01:16:07.159
What are you going to do?

01:16:11.327 --> 01:16:15.286
Sean, I was... I beg your pardon.

01:16:15.447 --> 01:16:20.043
We ought to be in a railroad station,
then more people could come in.

01:16:20.207 --> 01:16:24.120
- Sorry. I broke something up, didn't I?
- You managed. What do you want?

01:16:24.287 --> 01:16:28.565
I was talking to Saidi.
He saw leopard tracks by the river.

01:16:28.727 --> 01:16:31.400
- Big?
- You know the boys.

01:16:31.567 --> 01:16:36.197
- It's the next thing to an elephant.
- We need a big one.

01:16:36.367 --> 01:16:40.838
Well, I suppose
we'd better go talk to him.

01:16:42.527 --> 01:16:45.803
- I'm sorry, Dallas.
- It's all right.

01:16:45.967 --> 01:16:49.755
I mean...
Dallas, just out of curiosity...

01:16:49.927 --> 01:16:54.284
- How did you get him started?
- I asked him how he liked to kiss.

01:16:54.447 --> 01:16:58.201
- You just asked him...
... how he likes to kiss.

01:16:58.367 --> 01:17:01.598
And you were just finding out when I...

01:17:02.367 --> 01:17:04.961
If I ever get a problem,
may I come to you?

01:17:05.127 --> 01:17:07.687
- Pockets!
- Yes, bwana.

01:19:02.607 --> 01:19:05.041
Bring him in a little!

01:19:12.207 --> 01:19:14.004
Watch it, Pockets!

01:19:55.247 --> 01:19:59.035
- Bring us another head rope!
- All right!

01:20:03.127 --> 01:20:05.687
Look out, he's loose!

01:20:10.567 --> 01:20:13.877
All right, let's go! Don't lose me!

01:20:41.007 --> 01:20:43.521
Our insurance rate just went up.

01:20:53.327 --> 01:20:57.445
Drop that thing off of there!
Don't give him time to rest!

01:20:59.247 --> 01:21:01.442
Lay it on! Over here!

01:21:09.687 --> 01:21:12.440
Take the door, Kurt.

01:21:22.567 --> 01:21:25.035
- All right, turn him loose!
- He's loose!

01:21:25.207 --> 01:21:27.198
Take it off.

01:21:34.647 --> 01:21:37.400
He's caught. Keep the rope tight.

01:21:46.007 --> 01:21:48.805
Push him from behind, Luis.

01:21:57.167 --> 01:21:58.441
All set.

01:22:07.047 --> 01:22:09.277
The easiest one we ever got.

01:22:27.287 --> 01:22:29.482
Well, we're stuck.

01:22:36.487 --> 01:22:39.479
- I'll take the cable over.
- OK.

01:23:09.447 --> 01:23:11.483
Look out, Kurt!

01:23:19.407 --> 01:23:20.999
Thank you!

01:23:23.407 --> 01:23:26.399
All right, Pockets. Take her away!

01:23:37.287 --> 01:23:39.403
You know, this afternoon...

01:23:39.567 --> 01:23:43.082
I don't like crocodiles,
especially when I'm in the water.

01:23:43.247 --> 01:23:45.966
Anyway... Thanks again.

01:23:46.127 --> 01:23:49.483
- A la tienne, mon pote.
- Prost!

01:23:49.647 --> 01:23:53.322
I need some help.
The baby leopard is not eating good.

01:23:53.487 --> 01:23:56.001
I'll get some milk and eggs.

01:24:01.087 --> 01:24:04.682
Our girl looks pretty good tonight.

01:24:04.847 --> 01:24:07.839
I'll flip you to see who goes with her.

01:24:08.527 --> 01:24:12.281
Let's go together. I don't trust you.

01:24:12.447 --> 01:24:15.439
Right, then give me my shilling back.

01:24:22.727 --> 01:24:25.844
- Kurt, come here a minute.
- What's up?

01:24:26.007 --> 01:24:29.443
- Somebody left the ostrich pen open.
- Here we go again!

01:25:09.887 --> 01:25:12.196
Why don't you catch him, Kurt?

01:25:13.167 --> 01:25:16.159
I'd better let the boys do it.

01:25:24.127 --> 01:25:28.166
Hey! Let the females go! Keep the male.

01:25:28.327 --> 01:25:32.002
The girls will come back
to the old man anyway.

01:26:17.647 --> 01:26:21.037
Hold still, baby... There it is.

01:26:22.047 --> 01:26:25.835
Pockets, got a pair of pliers?
He's got a thorn.

01:26:29.807 --> 01:26:32.275
Easy now, easy.

01:26:38.767 --> 01:26:40.598
She'll be better now.

01:26:43.527 --> 01:26:45.438
Come, baby.

01:26:50.447 --> 01:26:54.042
- Sean, look!
- What's all this?

01:26:54.207 --> 01:26:57.677
I was taking Tembo to the bath,
and I found this one.

01:26:57.847 --> 01:27:00.281
- Aren't they nice together?
- No.

01:27:00.447 --> 01:27:03.359
- They can play together.
- It takes 20 goats...

01:27:03.527 --> 01:27:05.597
Sean, don't speak...

01:27:05.767 --> 01:27:08.600
- Listen first, don't speak!
- Why not?

01:27:08.767 --> 01:27:11.440
- Don't make a fool of yourself.
- I'm a fool?

01:27:11.607 --> 01:27:15.680
- Not yet. Just if you don't listen.
- Well, I'm listening.

01:27:15.847 --> 01:27:19.237
I hired an African boy.
He's going to buy more goats.

01:27:19.407 --> 01:27:24.003
He'll milk them and take care
of Tembo and his friend. No trouble.

01:27:24.167 --> 01:27:26.681
- Aren't you glad you're not a fool?
- Dallas...

01:27:26.847 --> 01:27:28.678
Yes, Sean?

01:27:28.847 --> 01:27:30.439
Aw, hell!

01:27:31.407 --> 01:27:34.399
Come on, baby. Let's have a bath.

01:27:37.967 --> 01:27:40.356
You certainly won that one, bwana.

01:27:40.527 --> 01:27:44.236
Some day, Pockets. Some day...

01:27:44.407 --> 01:27:45.999
Here...

01:27:51.807 --> 01:27:53.399
It's good!

01:28:09.647 --> 01:28:11.877
Come, baby, come!

01:28:15.487 --> 01:28:17.796
- Take a look, bwana.
- What?

01:28:17.967 --> 01:28:20.527
It's worth your while.

01:28:49.967 --> 01:28:53.323
Funny how good she is with animals.

01:29:04.447 --> 01:29:07.245
She could even do it to me!

01:29:08.847 --> 01:29:11.441
You could use it.

01:29:16.527 --> 01:29:18.916
OK. That's enough!

01:29:21.767 --> 01:29:23.564
Come, baby!

01:30:09.327 --> 01:30:11.921
- Hi, Pockets.
- Hi, Dallas.

01:30:12.087 --> 01:30:14.840
What are you doing out here,
all by yourself?

01:30:15.007 --> 01:30:16.360
I don't know...

01:30:16.527 --> 01:30:20.202
You said that if you had a problem,
you would come to me.

01:30:20.367 --> 01:30:23.598
- Have you got one now?
- A problem? What about?

01:30:23.767 --> 01:30:25.837
- Brandy?
- Brandy...

01:30:26.007 --> 01:30:27.884
Aren't you in love with her?

01:30:28.047 --> 01:30:31.722
Are you nuts? Me in love with Brandy?
That's the most...

01:30:31.887 --> 01:30:34.765
- How did you know?
- The way you look at her.

01:30:34.927 --> 01:30:37.839
- A woman can tell.
- She can, huh?

01:30:38.007 --> 01:30:40.043
Then why didn't she notice it?

01:30:40.207 --> 01:30:44.564
- Probably she has. How do you know?
- She never did anything about it.

01:30:44.727 --> 01:30:47.799
So, as you told me, you've got to do it.

01:30:47.967 --> 01:30:50.720
That's fine, but what do I do?

01:30:52.647 --> 01:30:56.606
I can't ask her how she likes to kiss,
that's your stuff.

01:30:56.767 --> 01:30:58.678
Dallas, what do I do?

01:30:58.847 --> 01:31:01.839
Well... Did you ever dance with her?

01:31:03.167 --> 01:31:06.443
- I don't remember.
- Do you know how to dance?

01:31:06.607 --> 01:31:08.518
- As well as they can?
- Easy!

01:31:08.687 --> 01:31:11.247
Come on, we'll show them!

01:31:32.927 --> 01:31:35.316
I didn't know you could dance like that!

01:31:35.487 --> 01:31:37.796
Go ahead, Pockets. Show her!

01:32:16.007 --> 01:32:18.202
- Dallas?
- Yes?

01:32:18.367 --> 01:32:22.201
- E occupata?
- Vengo!

01:32:26.247 --> 01:32:28.477
- You've got visitors.
- Visitors?

01:32:28.647 --> 01:32:33.038
- From the village. Can't you hear?
- I wondered about the singing.

01:32:33.207 --> 01:32:35.960
They've made a song for you
and the elephants.

01:32:36.127 --> 01:32:39.722
Really! How nice!
I'll come in a moment.

01:32:51.407 --> 01:32:55.286
- What are they going to do?
- It's just a Warusha ceremony.

01:32:55.447 --> 01:32:57.039
Hi, Sean.

01:33:41.167 --> 01:33:43.556
What's the matter?

01:33:45.367 --> 01:33:48.040
Sean, please help me! Sean!

01:33:58.287 --> 01:34:03.281
We'd better go along and see
they don't get too enthusiastic.

01:34:23.327 --> 01:34:27.684
It's not funny. They want to
shave my hair and take my clothes off!

01:34:27.847 --> 01:34:30.600
- There was a man there.
- He doesn't speak English!

01:34:30.767 --> 01:34:33.076
You're now a member
of the Warusha tribe.

01:34:33.247 --> 01:34:38.037
They've given you a name:
Mother of Elephants, Mama Tembo.

01:34:38.207 --> 01:34:41.085
You're supposed to dance with them.

01:34:55.927 --> 01:34:59.363
- Roast beef! My favourite!
- Everything's your favourite.

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:03.600
- Arga, have you some red wine?
- Beer for me, please.

01:35:03.767 --> 01:35:05.598
- Where's Mama Tembo?
- In her room.

01:35:05.767 --> 01:35:08.884
The new member of the Warusha
is not coming to dinner.

01:35:09.047 --> 01:35:12.517
She's been in the tub for hours,
scrubbing all the paint off.

01:35:12.687 --> 01:35:16.646
- That stuff works like a dye.
- She says she has no skin left.

01:35:16.807 --> 01:35:19.719
It was mean not telling her
what she was getting into.

01:35:19.887 --> 01:35:23.197
- What do Italians like? Red wine?
- Any kind.

01:35:24.127 --> 01:35:28.405
- Get yourself another bottle.
- Arga! Another one.

01:35:34.287 --> 01:35:37.279
- Who is it?
- Sean. Are you decent?

01:35:37.447 --> 01:35:40.962
- No, don't come in, please!
- Cover up, I'm coming.

01:35:41.967 --> 01:35:44.561
Hello, Sonya. She's taken quite...

01:35:45.487 --> 01:35:49.116
- Oh, brother!
- You make me mad!

01:35:49.287 --> 01:35:53.883
When I look nice, you ignore me.
And now with this stuff on my face...

01:35:54.047 --> 01:35:56.277
- You look all right.
- Oh, phooey!

01:35:56.447 --> 01:36:00.440
- All right, you look terrible.
- So why don't you go away?

01:36:00.607 --> 01:36:02.882
- How do you feel?
- I hurt.

01:36:03.047 --> 01:36:06.278
I scrubbed and scrubbed.
I almost took my skin off!

01:36:06.447 --> 01:36:09.757
- It gave you a good colour.
- How can you tell?

01:36:09.927 --> 01:36:13.158
- I brought you a drink.
- Why?

01:36:13.327 --> 01:36:16.399
Well, I don't know, the way you're acting.

01:36:16.567 --> 01:36:20.606
But you were great today.
It meant a lot to that Warusha tribe.

01:36:20.767 --> 01:36:24.362
Now they say Mama Tembo is rafiki,
which means friend.

01:36:24.527 --> 01:36:26.358
Thank you.

01:36:26.527 --> 01:36:29.325
And they also say that
you're mbali mbali.

01:36:29.487 --> 01:36:32.843
If that means "covered with
cold cream" they are right.

01:36:33.007 --> 01:36:36.761
- It means you're different.
- Yes, nice and greasy.

01:36:36.927 --> 01:36:40.283
- Quit squawking.
- Well, look at me!

01:36:40.447 --> 01:36:42.358
I am.

01:36:42.527 --> 01:36:44.119
Come here!

01:36:45.967 --> 01:36:50.643
You are a little slippery!
Wipe it off and we'll try again.

01:36:53.327 --> 01:36:56.046
- I'm sorry.
- Women and their contraptions!

01:36:56.207 --> 01:36:58.675
Now, you stop squawking.

01:37:01.447 --> 01:37:03.517
Come and get it!

01:37:08.567 --> 01:37:11.365
I brought you your dinner.

01:37:14.767 --> 01:37:17.042
Now, Sean!

01:37:17.207 --> 01:37:19.767
Sean, I didn't mean to do it!

01:37:46.527 --> 01:37:49.121
Work 'em out onto the flats.

01:37:49.807 --> 01:37:52.446
Sean says move 'em out onto the flats.

01:37:52.607 --> 01:37:55.917
Make sure they know
that's where you want them.

01:38:42.207 --> 01:38:48.885
- Let me know when you've picked one.
- I'm looking for one with blue eyes.

01:39:04.927 --> 01:39:07.600
To the right, that bunch over to the right.

01:39:07.767 --> 01:39:11.316
Where he goes, we go.

01:39:50.767 --> 01:39:52.723
Hang on!

01:40:03.247 --> 01:40:06.762
Where are you hurt? Easy, take it easy.

01:40:07.887 --> 01:40:09.366
Shoulder?

01:40:12.727 --> 01:40:16.845
- Just a dislocated shoulder.
- Just dislocated, huh?

01:40:17.007 --> 01:40:20.317
I think she's right.
Hold still, I'll fix it.

01:40:21.767 --> 01:40:24.679
- Better?
- Yes, great.

01:40:24.847 --> 01:40:27.520
Let me have some of this water.

01:40:34.327 --> 01:40:37.205
OK, Chip? OK?

01:40:38.727 --> 01:40:40.558
My leg's hurt.

01:40:40.727 --> 01:40:43.195
Pull him out of there.

01:40:47.247 --> 01:40:49.636
Let's stand him up.

01:40:50.607 --> 01:40:54.600
Put your weight on your leg.
Try. That's fine.

01:40:56.447 --> 01:41:00.998
- It's not broken. It's all right.
- Get him out here and clean him up.

01:41:01.967 --> 01:41:04.606
I'll take a look at this car.

01:41:24.447 --> 01:41:28.918
Pretty lucky. We can tow this in
behind the green truck.

01:41:44.527 --> 01:41:50.124
- We sure were lucky this afternoon.
- Yeah, when that car went over...

01:41:50.287 --> 01:41:53.199
- Well, you never know, do you?
- Know what?

01:41:53.367 --> 01:41:54.959
- Women.
- What?

01:41:55.127 --> 01:41:57.766
- Or what they'll do.
- What do you mean?

01:41:57.927 --> 01:41:59.997
Brandy! When the jeep flipped.

01:42:00.167 --> 01:42:04.206
I'd have sworn she was in love
with one of those two Romeos.

01:42:04.367 --> 01:42:08.280
- Well, isn't she?
- She sure didn't act like it.

01:42:08.447 --> 01:42:13.123
I always thought... She didn't act
like she was in love, did she?

01:42:13.287 --> 01:42:18.281
- Not to my way of thinking.
- Nor to mine, either.

01:42:43.607 --> 01:42:46.917
- Rough trip?
- We never missed a bump.

01:42:47.087 --> 01:42:49.760
- What happened?
- They flipped the herding car.

01:42:49.927 --> 01:42:51.679
- Did they wreck it?
- It's OK.

01:42:51.847 --> 01:42:54.202
They're going to be OK, too.
Need any help?

01:42:54.367 --> 01:42:56.881
- We'll get cleaned up.
- I need a drink.

01:42:57.047 --> 01:42:58.844
Let's get unloaded.

01:42:59.007 --> 01:43:02.079
Pockets, give us a hand
with the wildebeest.

01:43:02.247 --> 01:43:06.240
You know animals don't like me.
I won't be any good to you.

01:43:06.407 --> 01:43:08.557
- You can get in their way.
- Sean!

01:43:08.727 --> 01:43:13.243
You told me I wasn't
going to fuss with the animals!

01:43:16.887 --> 01:43:18.843
All right, Sean.

01:43:19.007 --> 01:43:20.838
He's hooked.

01:43:21.007 --> 01:43:22.884
Here, Pockets, take this line...

01:43:23.607 --> 01:43:26.121
What are you doing up there?

01:43:26.287 --> 01:43:29.643
If he were up here, I'd be down there.

01:43:29.807 --> 01:43:33.356
Take this line.
Pull him out when we open this door.

01:43:33.527 --> 01:43:38.521
And keep the slack out of it,
so he won't get hurt.

01:43:57.167 --> 01:44:02.287
Ready, Pockets? Watch out!
Don't fall in with those buffalo!

01:44:02.447 --> 01:44:05.245
Thanks for the advice, Sean!

01:44:21.567 --> 01:44:23.922
Pockets, darling!

01:44:24.087 --> 01:44:25.725
Are you all right?

01:44:25.887 --> 01:44:30.324
Speak to me please, darling.
Poor sweet baby!

01:44:30.487 --> 01:44:34.036
- Pockets! Do something, Sean!
- What's the matter with him?

01:44:34.207 --> 01:44:37.517
He's hurt. He doesn't speak,
he doesn't hear me.

01:44:37.687 --> 01:44:40.485
Pockets, darling, please speak to me.

01:44:41.767 --> 01:44:44.679
- Hello, Brandy.
- Are you all right?

01:44:44.847 --> 01:44:46.439
I think so...

01:44:47.567 --> 01:44:52.595
- No, you're not. You just say you are.
- Let me rest here a minute.

01:44:52.767 --> 01:44:55.281
Sean, we have to get him into the house.

01:44:55.447 --> 01:44:59.076
- I think you're right.
- Lift him carefully.

01:44:59.247 --> 01:45:02.284
- Pockets, you'll be all right.
- It's nothing...

01:45:02.447 --> 01:45:06.360
- What are you trying to do?
- I don't know, but I'm doing it right!

01:45:06.527 --> 01:45:09.041
Shall I give you a hot bath?

01:45:09.207 --> 01:45:12.438
Oh, no, Brandy... A hot bath?

01:45:12.607 --> 01:45:16.236
- You just get his bed ready.
- Right away.

01:45:17.087 --> 01:45:19.078
- Now?
- Now.

01:45:26.607 --> 01:45:28.837
Thanks for coming in to patch us up.

01:45:29.007 --> 01:45:31.999
- You'll make it.
- Dallas did a good job.

01:45:32.167 --> 01:45:34.601
- How's the leg?
- A drink would help it.

01:45:34.767 --> 01:45:37.884
- There's no ice. Arga!
- You're wasting your breath.

01:45:38.047 --> 01:45:40.242
- Why?
- There isn't any ice.

01:45:40.407 --> 01:45:42.967
- Why?
- They'll know sooner or later.

01:45:43.127 --> 01:45:45.800
- Might as well be now.
- What do you mean?

01:45:45.967 --> 01:45:49.243
If you want the ice,
look in Brandy's room.

01:45:49.407 --> 01:45:52.399
Go ahead! Take a look, both of you.

01:45:54.487 --> 01:45:56.876
All right, we'll humour you.

01:45:57.847 --> 01:46:01.999
- I think you're mean.
- They'll live through it.

01:46:19.167 --> 01:46:23.240
- How do you feel now, darling?
- Wonderful, Brandy.

01:46:23.407 --> 01:46:26.524
I was so frightened
when you fell off that fence.

01:46:29.167 --> 01:46:31.727
He fell off a fence.

01:46:32.767 --> 01:46:36.999
You nearly took a leg off,
I got a dislocated shoulder...

01:46:37.167 --> 01:46:40.443
- And he gets the ice.
- Yeah.

01:46:41.487 --> 01:46:44.479
Come on, I'll buy you a nice warm drink.

01:47:02.127 --> 01:47:06.279
How did you get outside?
You bad boy!

01:47:06.447 --> 01:47:08.438
Come back in, come on!

01:47:11.487 --> 01:47:14.797
Oh, no! Three!

01:47:14.967 --> 01:47:18.596
What would Sean say? I can't tell him.

01:47:18.767 --> 01:47:21.520
- Tell him what?
- This one.

01:47:21.687 --> 01:47:23.598
What's so unusual?

01:47:23.767 --> 01:47:27.282
No... No! How did this happen?

01:47:27.447 --> 01:47:29.722
It must have happened
when I was asleep!

01:47:29.887 --> 01:47:32.003
- What do we do?
- How should I know?

01:47:32.167 --> 01:47:35.159
By gosh, we got another one.

01:47:36.087 --> 01:47:38.442
We're running an elephant nursery.

01:47:38.607 --> 01:47:40.040
Mother!

01:47:40.207 --> 01:47:42.767
That means that he can stay.

01:47:44.047 --> 01:47:46.720
Well... You won another one!

01:47:46.887 --> 01:47:49.242
Come on, baby. Let's go!

01:47:52.527 --> 01:47:54.643
Come, baby, come!

01:47:57.767 --> 01:47:59.758
Come in, don't be afraid!

01:48:02.367 --> 01:48:06.326
Have you fellows any idea
what Pockets is doing in the workshop?

01:48:06.487 --> 01:48:11.083
He won't let anybody in, he says
you promised him not to interfere.

01:48:11.247 --> 01:48:15.286
- Another invention.
- Something for catching monkeys.

01:48:15.447 --> 01:48:18.519
You know what he's been buying
to catch monkeys?

01:48:18.687 --> 01:48:21.804
Listen:
"840 feet of three-eighths nylon rope,

01:48:21.967 --> 01:48:24.640
"260 feet of one-eighth airplane cable,

01:48:24.807 --> 01:48:27.401
"80 feet of one-and-a-half
OD aluminium tubing,

01:48:27.567 --> 01:48:30.001
"1,200 square yards
of nylon fish net... "

01:48:30.167 --> 01:48:34.957
Fish net? Must be planning
to run them into the river to catch them.

01:48:35.127 --> 01:48:39.837
Just listen to this:
"100 Ibs black powder.

01:48:40.007 --> 01:48:42.441
- "Twenty war-surplus rockets... "
- What!

01:48:42.607 --> 01:48:45.167
For throwing ropes from ship to ship.

01:48:45.327 --> 01:48:50.401
Then four firing switches "to be used
in missiles for second-stage boost".

01:48:50.567 --> 01:48:51.886
Holy smoke!

01:48:52.047 --> 01:48:54.481
Is he catching monkeys
or launching them?

01:48:54.647 --> 01:48:57.957
We'd better have a little talk
with this gentleman.

01:49:01.127 --> 01:49:04.119
Sean, I'd put out that cigarette.

01:49:08.327 --> 01:49:12.320
- Hatari! Hatari!
- What are you talking about?

01:49:17.287 --> 01:49:22.042
You're washed up!
Come on and get that hose!

01:49:22.207 --> 01:49:25.483
Turn on the water. Come on, full force!

01:49:25.647 --> 01:49:28.798
No! Don't put water on it!
You'll spoil everything.

01:49:28.967 --> 01:49:31.640
- The place is on fire!
- What fire?

01:49:31.807 --> 01:49:33.877
- It's just powder, it'll clear.
- Powder?

01:49:34.047 --> 01:49:36.322
I thought you were trying
to catch monkeys.

01:49:36.487 --> 01:49:39.524
That's what I'm doing.
See, the smoke's clearing.

01:49:39.687 --> 01:49:42.485
- What are you doing?
- Wait!

01:49:42.647 --> 01:49:46.435
- You said you'd leave me alone.
- I didn't expect Cape Canaveral!

01:49:46.607 --> 01:49:50.282
You promised.
This place is restricted, off limits.

01:49:50.447 --> 01:49:53.325
- You did promise.
- Yes, I promised.

01:49:53.487 --> 01:49:55.000
Are you gonna break your promise?

01:49:55.167 --> 01:49:59.126
Did you set that thing off
or did it go off by itself?

01:49:59.287 --> 01:50:01.164
Did I?

01:50:01.327 --> 01:50:04.080
Well, what happened, Sean, was...
You see...

01:50:04.247 --> 01:50:07.398
- What?
- Well, I've heard...

01:50:07.567 --> 01:50:10.923
I didn't feel that... You promised!

01:50:13.087 --> 01:50:15.521
Get the roof fixed!

01:50:39.127 --> 01:50:40.560
- Hi, Brandy.
- Hi, sweetie.

01:50:40.727 --> 01:50:43.400
- What'll you have?
- Beer, if it's cold.

01:50:43.567 --> 01:50:46.604
- How's that invention coming along?
- Fine!

01:50:46.767 --> 01:50:49.804
How are you going to catch monkeys
with a rocket?

01:50:49.967 --> 01:50:53.084
He's going to scare 'em
half to death, like he did me.

01:50:53.247 --> 01:50:57.320
When they faint, we pick them up
on stretchers and carry them away.

01:50:57.487 --> 01:51:01.002
- OK!
- How can you catch them with a net?

01:51:01.167 --> 01:51:04.045
Look, I'm not going
to catch the monkeys.

01:51:04.207 --> 01:51:07.882
I'm gonna get 500 monkeys
under that net for you to catch.

01:51:08.047 --> 01:51:10.800
Some of them have got teeth
about an inch long.

01:51:10.967 --> 01:51:14.004
- I've seen bigger.
- An inch and a half.

01:51:14.167 --> 01:51:17.318
If I were you, I'd get some armour
to stop those monkeys

01:51:17.487 --> 01:51:21.116
sinking their teeth
into some part of my anatomy.

01:51:21.287 --> 01:51:22.925
I'll be ready in a few days.

01:51:23.087 --> 01:51:26.443
If you don't think
the invention will work, forget it.

01:51:26.607 --> 01:51:31.397
Forget that monkeys
have teeth this long, just don't bother.

01:51:31.567 --> 01:51:36.357
- Goodnight, Pockets.
- Goodnight, Brandy. Folks. Rest well.

01:51:39.287 --> 01:51:42.484
You don't suppose, by any chance...

01:51:42.647 --> 01:51:46.117
Problem is, you can't depend on Pockets.
It might work.

01:51:46.287 --> 01:51:47.879
What a thing to say!

01:51:48.047 --> 01:51:50.607
I'm not going to get my ears bitten off...

01:51:50.767 --> 01:51:54.077
- We'd better get busy.
- Let's have a look.

01:52:04.927 --> 01:52:06.838
Hi.

01:52:07.007 --> 01:52:10.886
Holy Muckya!
You look like a gasoline pump!

01:52:11.047 --> 01:52:14.198
- Can you bend down in that thing?
- Sure.

01:52:14.367 --> 01:52:16.437
Move around?

01:52:19.367 --> 01:52:21.483
The man from Mars.

01:52:21.647 --> 01:52:23.842
Take me to your leader!

01:52:24.007 --> 01:52:26.999
Give me a hand with this, Dallas.

01:52:30.767 --> 01:52:36.364
- Do you want your door closed?
- No, I can't breathe.

01:53:10.927 --> 01:53:13.919
There's more over here! Back! Back!

01:53:19.887 --> 01:53:21.957
Up, up you little devils!

01:53:22.887 --> 01:53:25.447
All we need is about 200 more.

01:53:48.167 --> 01:53:52.046
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

01:53:52.207 --> 01:53:53.640
Thank you.

01:53:53.807 --> 01:53:57.436
Three miles down the road,
past that little duka, is a tree.

01:53:57.607 --> 01:53:59.996
There are lots of monkeys in that tree.

01:54:00.167 --> 01:54:03.921
At 6.30 tomorrow morning,
I'll be ready to throw a net over them.

01:54:04.087 --> 01:54:09.002
- The rest, my friends, is up to you.
- You got them up that tree?

01:54:09.167 --> 01:54:10.885
- Yes.
- How?

01:54:11.047 --> 01:54:15.120
The Warushas were helpful. I gave
them two cartons of your cigarettes.

01:54:15.287 --> 01:54:19.075
That was very generous of you.
I hope they pleased them.

01:54:19.247 --> 01:54:21.522
They would have liked filter tips...

01:54:21.687 --> 01:54:24.838
What makes you think
the monkeys will be there tomorrow?

01:54:25.007 --> 01:54:30.400
I tied Rover and Cyclone under
the tree, barking nicely when I left.

01:54:30.567 --> 01:54:33.127
Have you got your armour ready,
King Arthur?

01:54:33.287 --> 01:54:36.643
Sir Galahad? Black Knight, Red Knight?

01:54:36.807 --> 01:54:38.718
And goodnight.

01:54:39.727 --> 01:54:43.720
- Sleep tight.
- Thank you. You too... You'll need it!

01:55:16.127 --> 01:55:18.766
- Rockets for Pockets.
- Everybody ready?

01:55:18.927 --> 01:55:20.679
You think this'll work?

01:55:20.847 --> 01:55:23.839
I've worked hard on this
and I'm a little nervous.

01:55:24.007 --> 01:55:25.406
I understand.

01:55:25.567 --> 01:55:30.083
I'm going to shoot the net over the tree.
There are at least 500 monkeys there.

01:55:30.247 --> 01:55:34.160
You worry about the monkeys, OK?
I'll be watching you.

01:55:34.327 --> 01:55:36.204
- The tree's over there.
- Sure.

01:55:36.367 --> 01:55:39.677
The rocket's pointing away from it. Why?

01:55:39.847 --> 01:55:41.803
I read books.

01:55:41.967 --> 01:55:45.562
Vectors, trajectors,
centrifugal forces and stuff.

01:55:45.727 --> 01:55:47.604
- You know what they are?
- No.

01:55:47.767 --> 01:55:50.759
So you wouldn't understand
why it points that way.

01:55:50.927 --> 01:55:53.282
But do you know?

01:55:53.447 --> 01:55:57.201
I suggest you get behind that tree.
I'm about to light this thing.

01:55:57.367 --> 01:56:00.279
I'm about to get behind a tree.

01:56:00.447 --> 01:56:03.359
When the net is over the tree,
get in there fast,

01:56:03.527 --> 01:56:06.325
and get those monkeys
before they get away.

01:57:06.447 --> 01:57:09.245
It worked! Pockets, it worked!

01:57:10.927 --> 01:57:14.761
- It did?
- All right, Luis. Get the cage truck.

01:57:14.927 --> 01:57:16.918
Let's go get 'em!

01:57:18.487 --> 01:57:19.966
It worked...!

01:57:20.127 --> 01:57:21.879
It worked!

01:57:26.807 --> 01:57:29.196
Timber!

01:57:32.247 --> 01:57:35.478
Go get the monkeys! Come on!

01:57:54.127 --> 01:57:57.563
- We're going great. Another box!
- We?

01:58:01.447 --> 01:58:04.007
That's good! Get another cage!

01:58:06.567 --> 01:58:09.127
OK, put 'em in. That's good.

01:58:21.207 --> 01:58:23.880
OK, put 'em in. That's good.

01:58:38.247 --> 01:58:42.001
Here comes Pockets. We'll have
to tell him again about the rocket.

01:58:42.167 --> 01:58:45.045
Well, he earned it.

01:58:46.687 --> 01:58:50.282
- Sean?
- Yes, Pockets.

01:58:50.447 --> 01:58:53.086
Sean, the rocket was all right, wasn't it?

01:58:53.247 --> 01:58:57.320
As I said, nobody can ever say
your inventions don't work.

01:58:57.487 --> 01:59:00.160
Thank you, Sean.

01:59:00.327 --> 01:59:03.444
I didn't see it. I was behind a tree.

01:59:03.607 --> 01:59:07.361
- I had my hands over my eyes!
- I know.

01:59:07.527 --> 01:59:09.722
- Tell me about it.
- He has, twice.

01:59:09.887 --> 01:59:11.605
Tell me again, Sean!

01:59:11.767 --> 01:59:15.282
The rocket went up,
just like you said it'd go.

01:59:15.447 --> 01:59:18.166
Went over that tree
and took the net with it.

01:59:18.327 --> 01:59:21.399
- Just like you said it would.
- Just like I said.

01:59:21.567 --> 01:59:23.637
Did the monkeys get away, Sean?

01:59:23.807 --> 01:59:27.959
- We got close to 500 of 'em caged.
- $6,000 dollars' worth.

01:59:28.127 --> 01:59:30.277
Tell me about the smoke.

01:59:30.447 --> 01:59:34.406
Well, I... Actually,
Kurt could see that better than I.

01:59:34.567 --> 01:59:37.764
- What?
- Go on, tell him.

01:59:37.927 --> 01:59:41.920
Well, there it was,
the great silver rocket...

01:59:42.087 --> 01:59:43.725
It was red and blue!

01:59:43.887 --> 01:59:47.516
The great red and blue
silver rocket, leaving a white trail...

01:59:47.687 --> 01:59:49.643
...against the blue sky.

01:59:49.807 --> 01:59:52.685
You never said that.
It must have been beautiful.

01:59:52.847 --> 01:59:54.280
It was.

01:59:54.447 --> 01:59:57.007
Sean, tell me again about the rocket.

01:59:57.167 --> 02:00:00.000
It went just like you said it would. Gin!

02:00:00.167 --> 02:00:03.284
I had my hands over my eyes.

02:00:03.447 --> 02:00:06.917
- It's too bad you didn't see it.
- Tell me!

02:00:07.087 --> 02:00:10.204
Pockets! Get me a drink, will you?

02:00:12.247 --> 02:00:14.442
Left a white trail.

02:00:14.607 --> 02:00:17.167
A white trail against the blue sky.

02:00:29.327 --> 02:00:34.401
- Where's she going?
- She's taking the elephants for a swim.

02:00:34.567 --> 02:00:36.922
Come on, baby!

02:00:37.087 --> 02:00:38.679
Jambo!

02:00:40.767 --> 02:00:42.962
Go get a gun and follow her, and see...

02:00:43.127 --> 02:00:46.164
I don't think I can go fast enough,
big bwana.

02:01:36.407 --> 02:01:38.682
Come, baby. Come!

02:02:13.207 --> 02:02:14.845
That's good!

02:02:44.687 --> 02:02:46.962
OK, baby! Let's go!

02:02:53.807 --> 02:02:56.275
Come on, baby!

02:03:14.807 --> 02:03:16.525
Hi!

02:03:17.247 --> 02:03:19.807
What did I say about
leaving the compound

02:03:19.967 --> 02:03:22.686
without somebody carrying a gun?

02:03:22.847 --> 02:03:26.476
It wouldn't do me any good
to carry a gun, I can't shoot.

02:03:26.647 --> 02:03:30.560
- It's a very short way.
- It's far enough to get you into trouble.

02:03:30.727 --> 02:03:35.198
That "swimming pool" is a water-hole,
the only one around here.

02:03:35.367 --> 02:03:38.245
- Everything comes here to drink.
- I won't bother them.

02:03:38.407 --> 02:03:39.999
They might bother...

02:03:40.447 --> 02:03:43.598
- What's that?
- Keep quiet.

02:03:53.127 --> 02:03:55.482
Well, that does it.

02:03:55.647 --> 02:04:00.641
Some of Tembo's grandfathers
are around. Here.

02:04:01.767 --> 02:04:03.758
Keep walking.

02:04:25.567 --> 02:04:27.478
Keep moving.

02:04:30.927 --> 02:04:34.124
Get behind that tree and stay there.

02:05:25.767 --> 02:05:28.327
You can come out now.

02:05:35.767 --> 02:05:38.759
We're lucky. I think they've gone.

02:05:38.927 --> 02:05:42.124
I was afraid you were going
to have to shoot him.

02:05:42.287 --> 02:05:45.279
Him? That was a cow.

02:05:45.447 --> 02:05:49.281
She was trying to tell us
to leave her baby alone.

02:05:49.447 --> 02:05:53.076
She has one, you have three.
She figured you had enough.

02:05:53.247 --> 02:05:55.761
So do I. Come on.

02:05:55.927 --> 02:05:58.316
OK. Let's go, baby. Come!

02:06:10.767 --> 02:06:14.442
- Just about wound up.
- I only see one order left to fill.

02:06:14.607 --> 02:06:18.361
- That's right, Indian, the rhino.
- You're going to try them?

02:06:18.527 --> 02:06:22.281
- You still believe in that jinx?
- I still can't walk good, but...

02:06:22.447 --> 02:06:25.883
...I won't waste any more breath.
Do one thing to humour me.

02:06:26.047 --> 02:06:29.084
- What's that?
- Use the power wagon for herding.

02:06:29.247 --> 02:06:30.919
- It's slower.
- Fast enough.

02:06:31.087 --> 02:06:33.362
And higher. A rhino can't climb into it.

02:06:33.527 --> 02:06:34.926
I'll buy that.

02:06:35.087 --> 02:06:38.284
- Is it working good?
- I'm the one who has to drive it.

02:06:38.447 --> 02:06:40.915
All right. We'll use two ropes tomorrow.

02:06:41.087 --> 02:06:46.115
Chips, you take a pole with Kurt.
We leave early so we'd better turn in.

02:06:46.287 --> 02:06:52.317
We don't want any hangovers
or fuzzy heads in the morning, Pockets!

02:06:52.487 --> 02:06:54.239
All right, goodnight!

02:07:18.847 --> 02:07:21.680
Pockets, tell Sean
he's looking the wrong way.

02:07:21.847 --> 02:07:25.635
You've got a visitor, right behind you!

02:07:28.847 --> 02:07:34.126
Why don't you put the tailgate down
and let him climb in?

02:07:48.847 --> 02:07:52.635
- We'll take this one.
- Kurt, we'll take this one.

02:07:54.807 --> 02:07:56.399
Will do.

02:08:10.327 --> 02:08:12.682
This is a big one. Don't be in a hurry.

02:08:12.847 --> 02:08:14.883
I'll be very careful, bwana.

02:08:38.127 --> 02:08:40.595
You're supposed to chase him!

02:08:42.007 --> 02:08:43.998
Tell him that!

02:08:54.847 --> 02:08:58.157
- Move in a little, Pockets.
- Moving in.

02:09:11.087 --> 02:09:13.647
Watch that line, Saidi!

02:09:29.687 --> 02:09:33.043
Take a dolly around that roller bar!

02:09:34.127 --> 02:09:39.155
Hang on! Hang on, boys!
Hang on to the son of a...

02:09:40.687 --> 02:09:43.485
All right, Luis. He's all yours.

02:09:55.487 --> 02:09:58.285
Lay that loop over his head, Chips.

02:10:01.687 --> 02:10:05.282
- Kurt, pull her forward a little.
- Say when.

02:10:08.687 --> 02:10:10.678
When!

02:10:16.727 --> 02:10:19.799
- Stand still, there.
- Jump the other one.

02:10:19.967 --> 02:10:23.960
Keep those ropes taut.
I'm gonna try and move him.

02:10:33.927 --> 02:10:36.077
Loosen this up a little.

02:10:43.007 --> 02:10:44.998
Loosen this up a little.

02:10:47.927 --> 02:10:51.806
- Fair day's work!
- Nice going, big bwana.

02:10:51.967 --> 02:10:55.482
- That's the end of your jinx.
- Sure looks that way.

02:10:55.647 --> 02:10:59.003
Kick him in the backsides
for old times' sake?

02:11:02.807 --> 02:11:05.799
Don't get tangled in those ropes!

02:11:10.727 --> 02:11:12.843
Hang on to him!

02:11:15.567 --> 02:11:18.286
Look out! He's loose!

02:11:24.607 --> 02:11:26.837
Well... Let's start over.

02:11:27.007 --> 02:11:28.998
Get going again!

02:12:07.127 --> 02:12:10.119
All right, move in a little closer.

02:12:24.687 --> 02:12:26.837
Is that close enough?

02:12:33.287 --> 02:12:35.676
Let's give it a try. He's tired.

02:12:39.247 --> 02:12:42.319
Bwana, are we talking
about the same animal?

02:12:48.047 --> 02:12:50.038
Bring him in a little!

02:12:56.087 --> 02:12:57.998
Watch it, Pockets!

02:12:59.127 --> 02:13:02.119
Watch it, he's gonna quit on you!

02:13:27.567 --> 02:13:29.637
Get another rope around his head!

02:13:29.807 --> 02:13:33.800
We're all right.
Watch that line on the catching car.

02:13:36.847 --> 02:13:38.838
Take the rope.

02:13:49.487 --> 02:13:52.718
Unload the crate and grab those lines.

02:13:56.727 --> 02:13:59.924
Now, pull! Yank on it!

02:14:00.087 --> 02:14:01.520
Look out!

02:14:01.687 --> 02:14:03.882
All right, tip him over.

02:14:16.807 --> 02:14:18.763
They got him now!

02:14:19.687 --> 02:14:22.485
There you are, Indian.
He won't get away!

02:14:22.647 --> 02:14:25.844
Easy, Sean, easy! This breaks the jinx.

02:14:26.007 --> 02:14:28.680
I'll feel a lot better when he's delivered.

02:14:28.847 --> 02:14:33.045
- Bring in that crate.
- He's a real nice one!

02:14:40.807 --> 02:14:44.686
- Coming in.
- You got cleaned up in a hurry.

02:14:44.847 --> 02:14:47.759
Good to be finished,
nothing to do in the morning.

02:14:47.927 --> 02:14:51.920
We're not finished till we get those
animals to Mombasa, aboard ship.

02:14:52.087 --> 02:14:53.964
That won't take long.

02:14:54.127 --> 02:14:56.402
Marja Singh said he'd go with them.

02:14:56.567 --> 02:15:00.116
He's a good man.
What'll you do till next season?

02:15:00.287 --> 02:15:04.678
I had a letter from Bandini.
He's got a new car, wants me to drive it.

02:15:04.847 --> 02:15:06.678
I thought you quit that?

02:15:06.847 --> 02:15:10.522
I know, but... one more time won't hurt.

02:15:11.567 --> 02:15:14.240
I hope you don't break your neck.

02:15:14.407 --> 02:15:16.967
- The Frenchman is coming with me.
- Oh?

02:15:17.127 --> 02:15:20.676
We'll go to Paris.
We found out we both know a girl there.

02:15:21.807 --> 02:15:25.959
- One girl for the two of you?
- We'll go halves.

02:15:26.127 --> 02:15:29.642
It's a good excuse for another fight.

02:15:29.807 --> 02:15:34.119
- What's Dallas going to do?
- I don't know.

02:15:34.287 --> 02:15:39.202
- Do you want an opinion from me?
- Looks like I'm gonna get it anyway.

02:15:39.367 --> 02:15:43.406
It's like you got bit by a leopard
and now you see spots on everything.

02:15:43.567 --> 02:15:45.797
I know all about that.

02:15:45.967 --> 02:15:49.357
There's something about this girl.
I... I like her.

02:15:49.527 --> 02:15:51.995
- What?
- I really like her.

02:15:52.167 --> 02:15:53.998
It's gone that far?

02:15:54.167 --> 02:15:56.920
Look, I don't know her
and she doesn't know me.

02:15:57.087 --> 02:15:59.237
I've been busy. I haven't had time.

02:15:59.407 --> 02:16:01.967
Only three months,
the whole hunting season.

02:16:02.127 --> 02:16:06.279
- Are you pushing me?
- No! Take your time. She'll wait.

02:16:06.447 --> 02:16:10.156
- Look, Kurt. This is serious.
- Ask her to come back next year.

02:16:10.327 --> 02:16:14.081
She isn't very attractive.
She won't meet anybody like you...

02:16:14.247 --> 02:16:18.763
More cracks and you won't need
a racing car to break your neck.

02:16:18.927 --> 02:16:22.283
- Let's go to town.
- I don't think you should.

02:16:22.447 --> 02:16:24.722
You shouldn't be with her all evening.

02:16:24.887 --> 02:16:28.357
You might say something
you'll feel sorry about.

02:16:30.207 --> 02:16:34.996
- Am I as bad as that?
- You ought to know.

02:16:43.246 --> 02:16:45.807
- Who is it?
- Pockets.

02:16:46.847 --> 02:16:48.599
Come on in.

02:16:48.767 --> 02:16:50.405
Say, Dallas...

02:16:50.566 --> 02:16:52.443
Hi, Pockets.

02:16:53.207 --> 02:16:55.800
We're going into town...

02:16:55.967 --> 02:16:58.879
...to celebrate. Are you ready?

02:16:59.047 --> 02:17:02.278
I don't think I'll go,
I've got some work to do.

02:17:02.447 --> 02:17:06.406
Dallas, this is Pockets.
What's the matter?

02:17:07.406 --> 02:17:09.716
Isn't it going too good?

02:17:09.887 --> 02:17:12.879
No, it's not going too good.

02:17:13.847 --> 02:17:17.316
Probably my fault.
I messed it up a couple of times.

02:17:17.486 --> 02:17:20.558
That didn't mean anything.
You didn't mess it up.

02:17:20.727 --> 02:17:23.605
I didn't do it. She did it.

02:17:23.767 --> 02:17:27.396
- Come again?
- That girl you told me about.

02:17:27.566 --> 02:17:31.526
The one you said
made him burn his fingers.

02:17:32.367 --> 02:17:34.880
When he looks at me,
when he touches me,

02:17:35.047 --> 02:17:39.518
he likes what he sees
and what he feels just for...

02:17:39.687 --> 02:17:42.918
Then she's there
and I'm not there any more.

02:17:43.087 --> 02:17:46.477
- Well, couldn't you sort of?
- No, I couldn't.

02:17:49.927 --> 02:17:52.486
It's all over.

02:17:52.647 --> 02:17:56.434
I don't even know if I want him any more.

02:17:57.887 --> 02:18:00.879
I was all right until you came in.

02:18:02.246 --> 02:18:05.557
I just couldn't stand him looking at me

02:18:05.727 --> 02:18:10.084
and wondering
if I was going to be like her.

02:18:10.246 --> 02:18:12.556
I'd rather not have him.

02:18:12.727 --> 02:18:17.721
It just wouldn't...
Oh, please, Pockets, go away!

02:18:19.687 --> 02:18:24.282
Well, Dallas, if there's anything
I can do to help.

02:18:24.447 --> 02:18:27.598
Please go away, go with the others.

02:18:39.687 --> 02:18:44.522
All aboard! Bus now leaving
for 42nd Street and Arusha Square!

02:18:44.687 --> 02:18:48.043
- Everybody here?
- Where's Dallas?

02:18:48.207 --> 02:18:51.995
In her room. She's not coming.
Says she has work to do.

02:18:52.166 --> 02:18:54.282
- Well!
- Well, what?

02:18:54.447 --> 02:18:56.960
I'll see if I can get her
to change her mind.

02:18:57.127 --> 02:18:59.799
You all go on ahead,
I'll see you in town.

02:18:59.967 --> 02:19:03.277
Holy smoke!
What have you got in the third?

02:19:03.447 --> 02:19:05.563
- Pretty good, eh?
- Smells good, too.

02:19:05.727 --> 02:19:07.877
- This is business.
- Has it got a sister?

02:19:08.047 --> 02:19:09.958
Two sisters?

02:19:12.687 --> 02:19:14.803
Dallas? It's Sean.

02:19:14.967 --> 02:19:16.558
Come in.

02:19:18.087 --> 02:19:20.965
What's going on here?

02:19:21.127 --> 02:19:24.915
- Please turn the light off, Sean.
- Sure.

02:19:31.887 --> 02:19:34.924
What's the matter?
Why aren't you going with us?

02:19:35.087 --> 02:19:37.236
I just don't feel like it.

02:19:38.007 --> 02:19:39.520
You've been crying.

02:19:39.687 --> 02:19:42.996
What if I have?
Can't somebody cry if they want to?

02:19:43.166 --> 02:19:46.079
- What are you crying about?
- Nothing, nothing.

02:19:46.246 --> 02:19:49.683
A girl doesn't cry about nothing.
It must be something.

02:19:49.847 --> 02:19:53.283
It's because I... I got a scrotch.

02:19:53.447 --> 02:19:56.484
- A what?
- A scrotch, going through the bush.

02:19:56.647 --> 02:20:00.037
- Oh, a scratch!
- Scratch or scrotch, it hurts.

02:20:00.207 --> 02:20:02.243
- What are you doing?
- Hold still!

02:20:02.407 --> 02:20:06.036
No wonder it hurts,
the thorn is still in you.

02:20:06.207 --> 02:20:09.358
There...
There's some iodine around here.

02:20:09.527 --> 02:20:11.597
Never mind, just let it go.

02:20:11.767 --> 02:20:13.917
It would be better with something on it.

02:20:14.087 --> 02:20:16.362
You need iodine worse than I do.

02:20:16.527 --> 02:20:19.405
- I need iodine?
- For your fingers.

02:20:19.567 --> 02:20:22.923
- There's nothing wrong with them!
- Yes, there is!

02:20:23.087 --> 02:20:26.875
I got all mixed up.
You don't use iodine on a burn, do you?

02:20:27.047 --> 02:20:29.720
A burn? Make sense!

02:20:29.887 --> 02:20:34.199
- How do you treat burned fingers?
- I guess you... put butter on them.

02:20:34.367 --> 02:20:37.643
Yeah, then some day
you'll find somebody with butter.

02:20:37.807 --> 02:20:41.925
I don't get it. Fingers, butter...
What are you talking about?

02:20:42.087 --> 02:20:45.602
Go away! You always come
when I don't want you.

02:20:45.767 --> 02:20:49.885
- Oh, Dallas, cut it out!
- Don't touch me! Leave me alone!

02:20:50.047 --> 02:20:53.517
- Get out of here before I...
- OK!

02:21:07.487 --> 02:21:10.445
Now, what the hell did I say?

02:21:17.047 --> 02:21:21.563
First morning we can sleep,
those elephants...

02:21:21.727 --> 02:21:23.285
What a racket!

02:21:23.447 --> 02:21:27.486
Hasn't Mama Tembo
fed them this morning?

02:21:27.647 --> 02:21:31.959
Mama Tembo has gone.
That's why they're yelling.

02:21:32.127 --> 02:21:34.641
- "Gone"?
- She left a little while ago.

02:21:34.807 --> 02:21:37.082
What do you mean, "left"?

02:21:37.247 --> 02:21:40.683
- He may understand you, Pockets.
- I'll take a chance.

02:21:40.847 --> 02:21:44.362
She has packed her bags
and departed from our midst.

02:21:44.527 --> 02:21:49.043
- She can't do that!
- I found this letter under my door.

02:21:49.207 --> 02:21:54.122
- Behave and I'll tell you what she says.
- Well, read it.

02:21:54.287 --> 02:21:57.040
"Dearest Pockets... " That's me.

02:21:57.207 --> 02:22:01.883
"I can't stand goodbyes, so
I'm having Saidi drive me into town. "

02:22:02.047 --> 02:22:04.561
You notice she doesn't write
with an accent.

02:22:04.727 --> 02:22:07.844
"Tell everybody that
I can't find words to thank them,

02:22:08.007 --> 02:22:12.080
"that I'll never forget them,
that I love them. Dallas. "

02:22:12.247 --> 02:22:15.444
- You believe now that she's gone?
- I'm gonna stop her.

02:22:15.607 --> 02:22:17.837
You didn't want her to go?

02:22:18.007 --> 02:22:21.079
- Of course I didn't!
- You asked her to stay?

02:22:21.247 --> 02:22:24.603
- I was going to ask her, but...
- But what?

02:22:24.767 --> 02:22:28.521
- She wouldn't let me. She ran me out.
- She's smart.

02:22:28.687 --> 02:22:31.326
- What are you going to do?
- Find her.

02:22:31.487 --> 02:22:34.763
Arusha's a big town,
if she doesn't want to be found.

02:22:34.927 --> 02:22:37.316
- Tembo might find her.
- Get him on the scent.

02:22:37.487 --> 02:22:39.921
- He's got a long nose!
- Hurry!

02:22:40.087 --> 02:22:41.645
Right!

02:22:41.807 --> 02:22:44.367
- What's this?
- She left that behind.

02:22:44.527 --> 02:22:46.643
Make a good bandage for your fingers.

02:22:46.807 --> 02:22:50.117
Friends! Tell the airport
not to let her on a plane.

02:22:50.287 --> 02:22:55.042
- Shall we say why?
- Say she stole something. Money.

02:22:55.207 --> 02:22:57.277
Tell the police to watch the Nairobi road.

02:22:57.447 --> 02:22:59.802
- How much money?
- She robbed a bank.

02:22:59.967 --> 02:23:02.686
Chips and I will check the taxi station.

02:23:02.847 --> 02:23:05.998
I'll go with them.
I can go places they can't.

02:23:06.167 --> 02:23:08.078
Hurry it up, Luis.

02:23:08.247 --> 02:23:12.525
Why bring all three?
We can only use Tembo.

02:23:14.127 --> 02:23:16.687
Get in there, get in!

02:23:17.967 --> 02:23:19.878
Hold it!

02:23:22.647 --> 02:23:27.675
Come on, Tembo!
What does she do to make him move?

02:23:27.847 --> 02:23:31.965
Come on, get in. Come on, Tembo!

02:23:42.767 --> 02:23:44.280
Come on!

02:23:44.447 --> 02:23:47.439
This might work!

02:23:47.607 --> 02:23:49.484
What is that?

02:23:49.647 --> 02:23:53.401
Look, Tembo! Look, this is Mama.
Yes, Mama!

02:23:53.567 --> 02:23:55.876
Bwana, you remember Mama, don't you?

02:23:56.047 --> 02:23:59.437
Come on, take a good smell now.

02:23:59.607 --> 02:24:01.996
- Yes, it's Mama!
- It's gonna work!

02:24:02.167 --> 02:24:05.523
Wise child that knows its own mother.

02:24:05.687 --> 02:24:08.440
Come on, there's no room for you.

02:24:30.687 --> 02:24:35.715
Airport? If a girl about 5' 6" tall
with red hair shows up,

02:24:35.887 --> 02:24:40.244
don't let her on a plane,
she robbed the Bank of England.

02:25:16.967 --> 02:25:20.642
- Wait a minute, stop! Sean!
- Any luck?

02:25:20.807 --> 02:25:23.082
She's not at the railroad station.

02:25:23.247 --> 02:25:26.205
- She's been to the ticket office.
- What for?

02:25:26.367 --> 02:25:30.280
Airline ticket, but she wasn't
at the airport. She must be in town.

02:25:30.447 --> 02:25:32.483
- Where?
- I don't know.

02:25:32.647 --> 02:25:35.798
- Tembo doing any good?
- Not a thing.

02:25:35.967 --> 02:25:39.164
- Do those clothes belong to Dallas?
- Sure.

02:25:39.327 --> 02:25:44.526
He's probably smelling them,
no wonder. Give them to us.

02:26:09.407 --> 02:26:12.444
Sean, slow up.
I think he smells something.

02:26:15.847 --> 02:26:18.441
He does smell something.

02:26:22.647 --> 02:26:25.639
Come on, Tembo. Come on, baby.

02:26:27.287 --> 02:26:31.280
There he goes...
He's going into Singh's. Come on.

02:26:43.527 --> 02:26:45.165
Oh, no!

02:27:24.687 --> 02:27:26.518
Go away!

02:28:44.207 --> 02:28:46.675
You shouldn't have done it!

02:28:47.647 --> 02:28:50.719
It's not... It's not fair!

02:28:54.247 --> 02:28:58.718
I didn't want you to do this...
Why, why did you?

02:28:58.887 --> 02:29:02.323
- Look, Dallas...
- What did you do that for?

02:29:02.487 --> 02:29:05.604
Why didn't you just let me go?

02:29:05.767 --> 02:29:08.759
Go away! It's all your fault.

02:29:37.207 --> 02:29:38.799
Goodnight, Sean!

02:29:50.247 --> 02:29:55.844
Before you go any further,
I should tell you you're not alone.

02:30:03.327 --> 02:30:07.400
- What's your name?
- They call me Dallas.

02:30:08.407 --> 02:30:11.399
What are you doing in my bed?

02:30:12.967 --> 02:30:15.083
Sean, I wanna talk to you.

02:30:15.247 --> 02:30:19.763
You know that girl Dallas
we were looking for? If we wanna...

02:30:19.927 --> 02:30:21.758
Oh, Sean.

02:30:21.927 --> 02:30:26.239
You know that girl we were
looking for this afternoon?

02:30:26.407 --> 02:30:29.399
- She's in your bed.
- Pockets. Out.

02:30:29.567 --> 02:30:32.206
- What's she doing in your bed?
- Get out.

02:30:32.367 --> 02:30:34.278
We got married this afternoon!

02:30:34.447 --> 02:30:36.517
Oh, no!

02:30:36.687 --> 02:30:39.406
Go away! Go away, now!

02:30:40.527 --> 02:30:42.757
Tembo, go away!

02:30:42.927 --> 02:30:45.361
Tembo!

02:30:45.527 --> 02:30:47.518
Go away!
