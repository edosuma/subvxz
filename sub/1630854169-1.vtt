WEBVTT

00:56.891 --> 00:59.192
- Now, put
your hands together

00:59.226 --> 01:01.194
for the Green Knights!

02:02.222 --> 02:04.257
- Their flyer looks
like a sloppy noodle

02:04.291 --> 02:06.159
on that pyramid dismount.

02:14.869 --> 02:17.505
Sandra, wolf wall
then full pyramid.

02:17.538 --> 02:18.573
You're flying.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.776
Think you can pull it
off without sucking?

02:21.809 --> 02:23.511
- But we rarely practiced.

02:25.278 --> 02:27.314
- Your cheer captain
asked you a question.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.856
- You can break your
loser neck for all I care,

02:34.889 --> 02:37.892
as long as you
stick that landing.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.192
Got it?

02:39.226 --> 02:40.494
Thanks.

02:45.767 --> 02:46.601
- Hey.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.269
Don't let her get to you.

02:49.302 --> 02:51.238
You're here because
you deserve to be.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.809
Just remember when you get
up there, don't look down.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.511
Eyes on the prize,
straight ahead.

02:59.246 --> 03:00.615
- Thank you.

03:00.648 --> 03:01.582
- You've got this.

03:01.616 --> 03:02.482
- Next up,

03:02.517 --> 03:04.619
the reigning cheer
national champions,

03:04.652 --> 03:06.688
the Elk Moore Diablos!

03:06.721 --> 03:07.955
- All right.

03:07.989 --> 03:09.724
Okay, gather around.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.259
Everyone here?

03:12.292 --> 03:14.896
Okay, Diablos on three.

03:14.929 --> 03:16.430
One, two--

03:16.463 --> 03:17.932
- Diablos!

04:01.776 --> 04:03.044
Do it like this.

04:24.331 --> 04:26.768
- What the hell, Sandra?

05:10.545 --> 05:12.713
- Abby, you're late!

05:18.653 --> 05:21.122
- Okay, getting in
the car, gotta go.

05:27.562 --> 05:30.097
- Diablos,
Diablos, take that ball.

05:30.131 --> 05:32.767
Take that ball away and score!

05:37.872 --> 05:39.974
- Shake that ass Satan!

05:40.007 --> 05:41.474
- Bite me, woo!

05:52.720 --> 05:57.357
- Another touchdown
for the Green Knights.

05:58.893 --> 06:01.428
- Would you look at
those bitches stunt?

06:01.461 --> 06:03.164
- We could flash just as high

06:03.197 --> 06:05.867
if we were allowed to do
more than a Zumba routine.

06:05.900 --> 06:07.969
- The Green Knights
are pretty bad ass.

06:09.804 --> 06:12.773
- Their uniforms are so
shiny like Christmas.

06:12.807 --> 06:14.542
- But they don't have
to hold a bake sale

06:14.575 --> 06:16.944
car wash raffle-athon
to pay for them.

06:16.978 --> 06:19.412
- Or practice on the
wrestling team's used mats.

06:19.446 --> 06:20.948
- They smell like sadness.

06:20.982 --> 06:22.683
- That smell haunts my dreams.

06:22.717 --> 06:24.685
- We're just as good as they
are. They just...

06:24.719 --> 06:25.920
have more money.

06:25.953 --> 06:28.455
- And we'd kick their freaking
asses too if we could stunt.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.527
- The
extra point is good,

06:33.561 --> 06:36.496
and the Green Knights extend
their lead at half time.

06:36.530 --> 06:39.800
Diablos zero, Green Knights 41.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.569
- Tori, skirt, now.

06:47.008 --> 06:49.911
- Like, could she be any
more star for attention?

06:49.944 --> 06:52.513
- We'll all get further if we
treat each other with respect.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.815
- Oh, please don't get
all "High School Musical."

06:59.086 --> 07:00.554
- Thirsty Stan incoming.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.455
Blink twice if you need help.

07:02.489 --> 07:03.557
- Shush.

07:04.759 --> 07:07.094
- Hey, I was wondering if you
could talk after the game.

07:07.128 --> 07:08.129
There was something
I was wondering--

07:08.162 --> 07:10.698
- Spencer, get your ass
in the locker room, now.

07:12.833 --> 07:13.935
- Wish me luck.

07:19.173 --> 07:20.107
- Don't even.

07:20.141 --> 07:20.975
- I'm not.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.077
But still, he's cute.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.079
- Yeah, not cute enough.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.681
Plus, you promised you weren't

07:26.714 --> 07:28.149
gonna get back
together with him.

07:28.182 --> 07:29.517
- Did I?

07:29.550 --> 07:31.018
- Yes, may I remind you

07:31.052 --> 07:32.653
he made out with a freshman.

07:32.687 --> 07:35.189
- It was a little kiss.
- She had baby bangs.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.258
- Okay, I have bangs.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.026
- So what, he just
confused you two?

07:40.861 --> 07:43.230
Come on, guys like
Scott, they always cheat.

07:43.264 --> 07:46.734
It's a really crappy
design feature.

07:47.568 --> 07:48.869
- Dually noted.

07:48.903 --> 07:50.137
- Good.

07:50.171 --> 07:51.839
- Paparazzi at 12 o'clock.

07:56.978 --> 07:59.847
- Now he on the other
hand actually is cute.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.550
- Evan?

08:02.583 --> 08:04.251
We were friends back in
elementary, end of story.

08:04.285 --> 08:05.119
- Mm-hmm, sure.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.120
Why not?

08:06.153 --> 08:07.555
- Because.
- he's hot.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.090
In an emo creeper kind of way.

08:09.123 --> 08:11.726
Like sexy Unabomber.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.027
- Tori.
- I'd do him.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.795
- Oh, we know, we know.

08:14.829 --> 08:15.363
- Oh, come on.

08:15.396 --> 08:16.897
Don't be such a prude.

08:16.931 --> 08:17.832
There's nothing wrong

08:17.865 --> 08:20.134
with exploring the
miracle of our bodies.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.636
So long as it's on our terms.

08:23.704 --> 08:26.207
- Well, I thank you
for that advice,

08:26.240 --> 08:29.677
but I don't remember
asking for it.

08:29.710 --> 08:30.678
- Is she for real?

08:30.711 --> 08:32.279
- Yeah, she is for real.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.688
- What the hell?

08:41.756 --> 08:44.158
Sidelines are off
limits, freshie.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.059
- Sorry.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.629
- Are you okay?

08:48.662 --> 08:50.664
- Yeah, I'm fine.

08:53.768 --> 08:55.803
- Hey, you think she's okay?

08:55.836 --> 08:59.040
- Evee is upset that I'm on
the cheer squad when she's not.

08:59.073 --> 09:00.775
- I didn't know she
wanted be a cheerleader.

09:00.808 --> 09:01.942
Why didn't she try out?

09:03.277 --> 09:04.945
- We decided that we should
try different things.

09:04.979 --> 09:07.648
We can't be joined at
the hip forever, right?

09:07.681 --> 09:10.651
- I think this is the perfect
year to try new things.

09:16.624 --> 09:20.061
- I wish I was their mascot.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.075
- Okay, team meeting.

09:34.108 --> 09:35.109
Abbs, get over here.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.914
Okay you guys, listen up.

09:39.947 --> 09:42.083
It's time to show them
whose field this is.

09:42.116 --> 09:44.218
Straight up liberty,
just like we practiced.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.753
- McKayla, you know we can't.

09:45.786 --> 09:46.720
Otherwise the
school is gonna know

09:46.754 --> 09:48.656
we've been secretly
working on our stunts.

09:48.689 --> 09:49.824
- Okay, so we'll chance it.

09:49.857 --> 09:51.258
No way we're just
flipping pom poms here

09:51.292 --> 09:53.027
like we're in the Glee club.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.695
- You want me to fly now?

09:54.728 --> 09:55.362
Like, right now?

09:55.396 --> 09:57.031
- Yeah.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.332
- Why can't Abby do it?

09:58.365 --> 09:59.867
- Acrophobia.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.735
- You're afraid of acrobats?

10:01.769 --> 10:03.270
- I'm afraid of heights.

10:03.304 --> 10:04.371
- Yeah, like
that's a thing.

10:04.405 --> 10:05.372
- Okay guys, listen up.

10:05.406 --> 10:07.041
Reagan, you're gonna be great.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.276
Stu, Jackie, Quincy,
you guys are basing.

10:09.310 --> 10:11.112
Wait, where the hell is Quincy?

10:13.247 --> 10:14.215
- Oh my God.

10:15.382 --> 10:17.985
- What's up?

10:18.018 --> 10:18.553
- No.

10:18.587 --> 10:19.954
Okay, Paige and Mateo,

10:19.987 --> 10:21.255
you guys are doing round
offs off your front.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.656
Everybody else is
spotting, okay?

10:22.690 --> 10:23.324
- Okay.

10:23.357 --> 10:24.792
- Diablos on three.

10:24.825 --> 10:27.895
One, two, Diablos!

10:27.928 --> 10:30.197
- Come on Diablos, let's go!

10:38.739 --> 10:40.674
- Diablos!

10:49.884 --> 10:51.018
- Well, isn't this a pickle.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.753
- Principal Simmons,
I can explain.

10:52.786 --> 10:55.189
- Ms. Miller, you had one
rule and one rule only.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.423
- It's not our fault.

10:56.457 --> 10:57.291
The Green Knights
were kicking our ass.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.459
- You broke by trust.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.761
Reagan could have been
seriously injured.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.129
- Football players get
injured all the time.

11:02.163 --> 11:05.065
- Football players are
athletes, big difference.

11:05.099 --> 11:06.033
Athletes train.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.736
Athletes know how to
not injure themselves.

11:08.769 --> 11:09.904
Cheerleaders don't.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.439
If anyone should understand
anything about that,

11:12.473 --> 11:15.075
I would think it
would be you Abby.

11:19.480 --> 11:21.248
- What?

11:21.282 --> 11:25.654
- Don't think I'm not aware
of your little plan.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.356
Recruiting my daughter
into your club,

11:29.390 --> 11:31.325
just to curry a favor for me.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.327
- Not at all, Paige, she--

11:33.360 --> 11:34.929
- I wasn't born yesterday.

11:36.030 --> 11:38.199
For Paige's sake and
Paige's sake only,

11:38.232 --> 11:40.467
I will not disband the
Diablo cheer squad,

11:40.502 --> 11:42.036
but here's the deal.

11:42.069 --> 11:45.472
There will be no jumping,
no lifts, no flips,

11:45.507 --> 11:47.341
no whatever it is you people do.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.243
One foot on the
ground at all times.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.477
Do I make myself clear?

11:50.512 --> 11:51.345
- What about regionals?

11:51.378 --> 11:52.346
They're in two weeks.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.948
- Principal Simmons, please.

11:53.981 --> 11:56.217
There's already a no
stunt rule in place.

11:56.250 --> 11:57.117
Our routine is--

11:57.151 --> 11:58.819
- Sucking!

11:58.852 --> 12:01.822
- Listen, just be grateful
I'm letting you compete.

12:01.855 --> 12:04.325
But if there is so much
as a single somersault

12:04.358 --> 12:06.093
on school property,

12:06.126 --> 12:08.862
I will cancel the cheer
squad for the next 50 years.

12:11.533 --> 12:14.134
- I mean, did you see the
look on Simmons' face?

12:14.168 --> 12:15.537
- You mean this?

12:15.570 --> 12:17.238
- Yeah, do that long
enough it's gonna stick.

12:17.271 --> 12:19.106
- It's too late for her.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.975
Anyway, it could
have been way worse.

12:21.008 --> 12:23.310
She could have banned this
regionals all together.

12:24.579 --> 12:27.515
- You know, Simmons
is not gonna be

12:27.549 --> 12:30.017
at the actual competition.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.185
- Yeah, so?

12:31.218 --> 12:34.154
- So she said no practicing
stunts on school property.

12:35.523 --> 12:38.392
- Wait, are you saying?

12:38.425 --> 12:39.360
Oh, you sneaky B.

12:39.393 --> 12:41.195
- That cheerleader
choreographed his fire.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.230
Now we just need somewhere
else to practice.

12:43.264 --> 12:45.099
- Yeah.

12:45.132 --> 12:49.003
- All right dill holes,
here's the cheer facts.

12:49.036 --> 12:51.539
This school gives zero
shits about our squad,

12:51.573 --> 12:53.575
but that's gonna end now.

12:53.608 --> 12:55.476
- Wait, we're still
going to regionals?

12:55.510 --> 12:57.144
- Mm-hmm.
- Yep.

12:57.177 --> 13:00.447
- There's there's no time
to nail our rogue routine.

13:00.481 --> 13:02.883
- Look, team, this
isn't gonna be easy.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.018
We don't have any funding

13:04.051 --> 13:05.486
and we barely have enough
people to make a full squad,

13:05.520 --> 13:08.122
but that's not what
cheer is about.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.490
We're more than
just a social club.

13:09.524 --> 13:10.824
We're athletes.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.026
We've got stunts.

13:12.059 --> 13:13.360
We've got moves
and we've got style

13:13.394 --> 13:16.030
and we are gonna show them
that we're the real deal.

13:16.063 --> 13:19.099
And I'm pretty sure
nobody's gonna say anything.

13:19.133 --> 13:19.933
Right, Paige?

13:21.335 --> 13:22.570
Good.

13:22.604 --> 13:24.104
We just need to practice
away from the school,

13:24.138 --> 13:26.006
and I'm not talking
just practice.

13:26.040 --> 13:29.076
We need a 24 hour cram
sesh this weekend.

13:29.109 --> 13:32.146
- Oh, but this
weekend is Halloween

13:32.179 --> 13:33.914
and I have a dope
costume picked out.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.115
- Tori, it's okay.

13:35.149 --> 13:36.850
You can be a slutty
Jigsaw next year.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.154
- Okay guys, this
weekend we eat,

13:40.187 --> 13:42.590
breathe and sleep
Diablo cheerleading.

13:42.624 --> 13:43.924
- Okay, but where?

13:43.957 --> 13:45.459
- I know, my house is big.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.494
And bonus, we have
two hot tubs now.

13:47.529 --> 13:51.198
Sharing with my brother was
so gross, like ass soup gross.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.334
- Okay, but mcmansion
isn't big enough

13:53.367 --> 13:54.536
for us to go full out.

13:54.569 --> 13:56.937
- Our baskets need
20 feet at least.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.472
- Wait, what?

13:58.506 --> 14:00.207
I'm going up 20 feet?

14:00.240 --> 14:02.042
- What about the
old abandoned school

14:02.076 --> 14:03.545
on the other side of town?

14:03.578 --> 14:05.245
- You mean the old
Elk Moore High School?

14:05.279 --> 14:07.047
- Yeah, where our
high school used to be

14:07.081 --> 14:08.482
before they built this one.

14:08.516 --> 14:10.552
It had lead pipes or something.

14:10.585 --> 14:12.386
- They closed it
because of the pestos.

14:13.454 --> 14:15.022
- I think you mean asbestos.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.425
- The school board
uses it for storage.

14:18.459 --> 14:20.260
I think I can get the key.

14:20.294 --> 14:21.596
- Seriously?

14:21.629 --> 14:23.364
Way to impress, new.

14:23.397 --> 14:25.332
- Okay wait, so how are
we going to get there?

14:25.366 --> 14:28.435
- Oh, my dad owns a bus company.
I'll see if I can get us a bus.

14:28.469 --> 14:30.104
- Really?

14:30.137 --> 14:31.372
- He's cheating on my mom
with my sister's nanny.

14:31.405 --> 14:33.474
He'll do anything I want,
as long as I don't tell.

14:33.508 --> 14:34.375
It's pretty sweet.

14:36.477 --> 14:38.145
- All right, we have a plan.

14:39.446 --> 14:42.483
- Bring your sleeping bags
and plenty of food and water.

14:42.517 --> 14:43.618
We'll make a small
party out of it.

14:43.651 --> 14:44.985
- Yeah, but we're gonna go hard.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.987
It's gonna be 24 hours
of straight cheer.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.657
If you're not in
it, we won't win it.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.493
Straight from hell,
never take an L.

14:52.527 --> 14:53.460
Who are we?

14:53.494 --> 14:54.395
- Diablo cheer!

14:54.428 --> 14:55.429
- Louder!

14:55.462 --> 14:57.498
- Diablo cheer!

15:03.303 --> 15:04.471
- Give a sec, Dan.

15:04.506 --> 15:05.406
- Bye.

15:05.439 --> 15:06.340
- Hey, Abbs.

15:08.208 --> 15:11.412
We didn't get to talk after
the game the other night.

15:11.445 --> 15:12.279
- Nope.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.283
- Need a ride home?

15:16.316 --> 15:17.217
- I drove.

15:19.453 --> 15:20.954
I've gotta go.

15:20.988 --> 15:22.557
- Hey, wait.

15:22.590 --> 15:23.424
Abbs.

15:25.192 --> 15:28.295
You were the best thing to
ever happen to me, okay.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.230
It shouldn't have
ended like that

15:30.264 --> 15:32.232
and I want to make it up to you.

15:32.266 --> 15:32.933
- Scott--

15:32.966 --> 15:34.268
- What are you doing tomorrow?

15:34.301 --> 15:35.436
You have any plans
for Halloween?

15:35.469 --> 15:36.370
- We have practice.

15:42.009 --> 15:43.110
- It's Evan, isn't it?

15:44.211 --> 15:45.713
I've seen the way
he looks at you

15:45.747 --> 15:47.549
like he's some
slenderman stalker.

16:17.745 --> 16:18.979
- Damn it, Evan!

16:20.147 --> 16:23.116
- You're not getting back
together with Scott, are you?

16:23.150 --> 16:25.018
- You scared the crap out
of me just to say that?

16:25.052 --> 16:26.086
What's wrong with you?

16:26.119 --> 16:28.021
- Well, he's an asshole, Abby.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.724
- And do you know that how?

16:29.757 --> 16:30.725
- People tell me things.

16:30.758 --> 16:32.159
- Like who?

16:32.192 --> 16:33.393
Nobody tells you anything

16:33.427 --> 16:35.062
because everyone's
freaked out by you.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.501
- Yeah, well at least I'm
not living my mom's dream.

16:42.737 --> 16:44.539
- Look, I'm sorry.

16:44.572 --> 16:45.439
That was mean, I--

16:45.472 --> 16:46.608
- No, no, it's okay.

16:46.641 --> 16:48.275
I'm sorry too.

16:50.712 --> 16:54.649
If you ever wanted to talk to
someone who isn't a meathead.

16:54.682 --> 16:57.384
- Yeah, I know where you live.

16:57.417 --> 16:58.285
- Okay.

16:58.318 --> 16:59.152
- Mm-hmm.

17:42.730 --> 17:44.231
- Just a minute.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.862
- Look guys, it's the bus
I was telling you about.

19:33.875 --> 19:36.577
And it even comes
with the driver.

19:36.611 --> 19:39.346
Actually, I think
he lives in it.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.748
- Is that thing road legal?

19:40.782 --> 19:42.382
- Mostly.

19:42.416 --> 19:44.852
- I thought you said your
dad owned a bus company.

19:44.886 --> 19:46.420
- He owns an impound yard.

19:46.453 --> 19:48.756
Therefore he owns this
bus, pending a court order.

19:49.857 --> 19:52.225
Woot woot, all aboard!

19:52.259 --> 19:53.961
- County McKayla, we're
missing three people.

19:53.995 --> 19:56.396
- What did you expect,
it's Hallo-weekend.

19:56.430 --> 19:57.699
- Do you think McKayla bailed?

19:57.732 --> 19:59.000
- No way.

19:59.033 --> 20:00.902
This is so weird,
she's never late.

20:00.935 --> 20:03.705
- Maybe we should
give her another five.

20:12.747 --> 20:14.314
- Okay guys.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.951
As co-captain of this squad,
I am making a decision.

20:16.984 --> 20:18.553
We leave now.

20:18.586 --> 20:20.555
Everyone who isn't on the
bus can meet us there.

20:21.789 --> 20:23.825
Andale Diablos.

20:25.793 --> 20:26.694
- I guess let's go.

20:41.509 --> 20:43.878
- What time are you
picking us up tomorrow?

20:43.911 --> 20:45.378
- We've got a gig tonight.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.748
Done by four, here by five.

20:48.348 --> 20:51.418
After that, I'm
dead to the world.

20:52.587 --> 20:53.386
- Perfect.

20:55.923 --> 20:56.758
- Sorry.

20:56.791 --> 20:57.792
- It's fine.

20:59.694 --> 21:02.864
- Hey, is it true
Silent Stu never speaks?

21:02.897 --> 21:06.333
- All I know is that he used
to cheer for the Green Knights,

21:06.366 --> 21:08.002
but then he got expelled.

21:08.035 --> 21:09.436
Something about a cartel.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.608
He hasn't said a
single word since.

21:13.641 --> 21:15.743
- Oh, that's why we
call him Silent Stu.

21:16.811 --> 21:17.945
- Oh sweetie.

21:22.683 --> 21:25.318
- My mom calls cell phones
our generation's opium.

21:31.959 --> 21:33.460
- Definitely a problem.

21:37.965 --> 21:38.800
- All right team.

21:40.467 --> 21:43.403
The next 24 hours are all
about some serious cheer.

21:43.436 --> 21:46.473
No distractions, no
posts, no pictures.

21:46.507 --> 21:48.843
You've got 30 minutes to
check your Instagram, TikTok,

21:48.876 --> 21:49.944
whatever else you're into.

21:49.977 --> 21:51.378
But when we get off this bus,

21:51.411 --> 21:53.848
cell phone's off
and into the sack.

21:53.881 --> 21:55.415
Guys, it's one day.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.652
This weekend is life or
death for Diablo cheer.

21:57.685 --> 21:59.554
By the time we're done,
we're gonna have a routine

21:59.587 --> 22:01.856
that's gonna make the Green
Knights pray for death.

22:03.991 --> 22:06.027
- A dark speech, go Capitano.

22:06.060 --> 22:10.064
- Abby, I need to be exempt
from this no cell phone policy.

22:10.097 --> 22:11.431
What if there's an emergency?

22:11.464 --> 22:12.867
- Like a sexting emergency.

22:12.900 --> 22:13.968
- I'm sure Danny can go one day

22:14.001 --> 22:16.369
without getting your
taco emoji Tori.

22:16.403 --> 22:17.738
- What are you talking about?

22:20.675 --> 22:21.609
- Aren't you guys hooking up?

22:21.642 --> 22:23.845
- You're being so presumptuous.

22:24.946 --> 22:27.081
I'm saving myself for marriage.

22:27.114 --> 22:28.983
I'm serious.

22:29.016 --> 22:31.484
I mean, but Danny's cute.

22:31.519 --> 22:34.021
We both like tacos so
maybe I'll marry him.

22:34.055 --> 22:36.591
- Oh, he likes tacos all right.

22:38.491 --> 22:41.095
- Oh gosh, he
responded so quick.

22:41.128 --> 22:42.763
He must like eggplants too.

22:43.798 --> 22:45.432
- Are you being serious?

23:01.883 --> 23:05.553
- This is the beginning
of Diablo cheer camp.

23:05.586 --> 23:08.155
We're gonna work like hell,
kick some butt, you know,

23:08.189 --> 23:09.690
practice until we draw.

23:11.926 --> 23:13.527
- That was kind of cute.

23:13.561 --> 23:15.529
You're like a Kirkland
Signature brand McKayla.

23:15.563 --> 23:17.497
- Only Kirkland brand is good.

23:17.531 --> 23:20.067
- All right everyone,
phones in the bag.

23:20.101 --> 23:21.903
Pick up your gear
and let's get inside.

23:25.740 --> 23:27.074
- Tori.

23:27.108 --> 23:27.942
- Huh?

23:30.477 --> 23:32.046
- Just release, thank you.

23:36.050 --> 23:36.884
- Hey.

23:38.085 --> 23:39.720
Breathe, you're doing great.

23:39.754 --> 23:41.856
- I'm gonna vomit
I am so nervous.

23:41.889 --> 23:43.557
I can barely
remember the routine.

23:43.591 --> 23:45.026
If McKayla doesn't show,

23:46.527 --> 23:47.595
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

23:47.628 --> 23:48.930
- You've got this.

24:13.054 --> 24:14.789
- Are we practicing in the dark?

24:14.822 --> 24:17.091
Because I'm a little
scared of the dark.

24:17.124 --> 24:18.626
- Of course you are.

24:22.063 --> 24:26.067
- Oh geez.

24:26.100 --> 24:29.070
- Looks like a trade school
for future serial killers.

24:36.143 --> 24:37.912
- Oh, over here.

24:44.151 --> 24:45.219
- You know, one winter,

24:45.252 --> 24:46.921
we were at our cabin up in Maine

24:46.954 --> 24:49.790
and all the electricity
went out for a whole day.

24:49.824 --> 24:52.860
It was so cold that
my daddy lit a fire

24:52.893 --> 24:55.863
and the housekeeper had to
sleep in the main house with us.

24:57.164 --> 24:59.233
- Yeah, she persisted.

25:06.240 --> 25:07.108
Stu.

25:11.679 --> 25:13.848
- Maybe we can sell
these at our next raffle.

25:13.881 --> 25:16.917
- Yeah, first we
cheer and then we mow.

25:18.285 --> 25:19.253
- Let's go.

25:22.757 --> 25:27.695
- Ladies and gentlemen,
we have arrived.

25:36.670 --> 25:39.206
- Okay, this place
is dirt nasty.

25:39.240 --> 25:40.841
- Yeah, but I'd
take a little dust

25:40.875 --> 25:42.710
over Principal Simmons any day.

25:42.743 --> 25:44.812
- So do we hold a seance first,

25:44.845 --> 25:47.014
or do we go straight
to the exorcism?

25:47.048 --> 25:51.085
- So this is where school
furniture comes to die.

25:52.353 --> 25:53.854
- Lets clear a space
and get the mats down,

25:53.888 --> 25:55.322
warm up and then go from there.

25:55.356 --> 25:57.691
- Ooh, co-captain
finally has a plan.

25:57.725 --> 26:00.895
Abby's our captain, at least
until McKayla gets here.

26:00.928 --> 26:02.897
- Look guys, for the
first time in years,

26:02.930 --> 26:05.766
we have a shot at showing
everyone who the goat is,

26:05.800 --> 26:08.302
but we have to focus
and work together.

26:08.335 --> 26:09.504
We're gonna add stunts, aerials,

26:09.538 --> 26:12.606
and we're gonna end with our
grand finale, hitch pyramid.

26:14.375 --> 26:16.744
- Like we've ever managed
to pull that one off.

26:16.777 --> 26:18.279
- Reagan, you're our best flyer.

26:18.312 --> 26:19.146
Are you ready?

26:19.180 --> 26:20.214
- Yeah.

26:20.247 --> 26:21.315
Yeah, of course I am.

26:21.348 --> 26:22.349
- Okay.

26:22.383 --> 26:23.350
- Well, what about music?

26:23.384 --> 26:25.820
You've got our phones, remember?

26:25.853 --> 26:26.487
- I do.

26:26.521 --> 26:29.223
Quincy, the boom box please.

26:29.256 --> 26:31.092
Quincy, music.

26:31.125 --> 26:33.227
- If music be the food of love--

26:33.260 --> 26:34.095
- I need that.

26:35.996 --> 26:36.831
- All right then.

26:43.070 --> 26:44.805
- What is that thing?

26:44.839 --> 26:47.675
- I think I heard the
elders speak of these.

26:47.708 --> 26:49.176
I don't know how
it works though.

26:52.713 --> 26:54.715
- Bright light, bright light!

26:59.286 --> 27:01.088
- Crunch time, Diablos.

27:18.739 --> 27:20.407
Five, six, seven, eight.

28:05.219 --> 28:06.287
Let's go back.

28:23.804 --> 28:26.140
- Yeah, I've got it.

28:35.482 --> 28:36.784
My ankle.

28:36.817 --> 28:38.018
- Reagan, are you okay?

28:38.052 --> 28:42.156
- Yeah, it's probably
just a twist.

28:43.257 --> 28:45.092
- Okay everyone, good job.

28:45.125 --> 28:47.461
Water break and then we
run in again in five.

28:47.494 --> 28:48.329
Okay, come on.

28:53.867 --> 28:55.002
- Yeah, just there.

28:57.071 --> 28:58.540
- Wow, Abby's straight flexing.

28:58.573 --> 29:00.241
- Yeah, she is.

29:01.408 --> 29:02.977
We're lucky to have her.

29:03.010 --> 29:04.411
Cheer wasn't even a
thing at this school

29:04.445 --> 29:05.946
before Abby and McKayla came

29:05.980 --> 29:07.915
and brought it back
their freshman year.

29:07.948 --> 29:10.017
- They had to fight
to get it too.

29:10.050 --> 29:11.919
Just think, if it
wasn't for cheer,

29:11.952 --> 29:13.988
I'd still be in the drama club.

29:14.888 --> 29:15.889
- That's so cool,
I didn't know that.

29:15.923 --> 29:17.825
Way to go co-captain.

29:18.926 --> 29:20.294
- Diablos are legacy.

29:20.327 --> 29:22.296
I couldn't just let it die.

29:22.329 --> 29:25.266
- Yeah, Elk Moore cheer was
straight fire back then.

29:25.299 --> 29:27.167
- Okay, so if the old
squad kicked so much ass,

29:27.201 --> 29:29.336
why would they kill
the cheer program?

29:29.370 --> 29:31.171
- Oh, oh, I know this story.

29:31.205 --> 29:33.874
A cheerleader died in
the middle of regionals.

29:33.907 --> 29:37.411
She was doing this big stunt
and then something happened.

29:37.444 --> 29:38.879
It was a really bad accident.

29:38.912 --> 29:41.048
She broke her neck
and her head fell off.

29:42.149 --> 29:43.951
- That's stupid,
heads don't fall off

29:43.984 --> 29:45.219
when you break your neck.

29:45.252 --> 29:48.389
- No, but it was a
really bad accident.

29:49.857 --> 29:51.859
They canceled the cheer
program the next day.

29:53.528 --> 29:55.029
- Great.

29:55.062 --> 29:56.397
Who's ready to get airborne?

29:59.501 --> 30:01.435
- Are you sure you're okay?

30:01.468 --> 30:03.070
- Yeah.

30:03.103 --> 30:05.540
I mean, I'm sure it's just
some sort of sprain, right?

30:05.573 --> 30:06.974
- Um.
- Oh.

30:08.976 --> 30:10.311
- Paige, get her a chair.

30:10.344 --> 30:11.945
She needs to elevate her foot.

30:12.880 --> 30:14.315
Sydney, get the phones.

30:21.656 --> 30:23.390
- Abbs,
where's the phone bag?

30:23.424 --> 30:25.092
- It's there, just keep looking.

30:26.126 --> 30:27.294
- You know what, this is silly.

30:27.328 --> 30:29.096
I probably just need
to put pressure on it.

30:29.129 --> 30:30.264
- What?
- And walk around.

30:30.297 --> 30:31.999
- Will someone give
me an ice pack?

30:32.032 --> 30:33.100
Where's the cooler?

30:33.133 --> 30:34.001
- Oh, on it.

30:39.440 --> 30:41.241
No ice.

30:41.275 --> 30:42.510
- What?

30:42.544 --> 30:45.145
- Wait, was I
supposed to bring ice?

30:45.179 --> 30:46.113
- Duh.

30:46.146 --> 30:48.482
What is the point of
a cooler without ice?

30:48.516 --> 30:49.450
- Details, man.

30:50.652 --> 30:51.885
- Tori, can you see
if there's ice packs

30:51.919 --> 30:52.920
anywhere in this place?

30:52.953 --> 30:54.021
Maybe the nurse's office?

30:54.054 --> 30:55.456
- Yeah.
- Okay, thank you.

30:57.124 --> 30:59.993
- I so sorry, I'll be quick.

31:01.629 --> 31:02.896
- Abbs, it isn't here.

31:02.930 --> 31:04.098
Did you leave it on the bus?

31:04.131 --> 31:05.265
- No way, I brought
everything in.

31:05.299 --> 31:08.268
- Hey, we should totally call
the bus driver and check.

31:09.403 --> 31:12.373
- We have no phones.

31:12.406 --> 31:13.641
Obviously.

31:13.675 --> 31:14.843
- A quick break while
we figure this out.

31:14.875 --> 31:17.411
Grab a snack and then hopefully
Tori will find some ice

31:17.444 --> 31:19.346
and we can get back to work.

31:19.380 --> 31:20.214
Okay?

32:21.776 --> 32:23.210
- Zingo, bitch.

32:29.617 --> 32:30.552
Ugh, boohoo.

32:35.657 --> 32:38.325
Uh, hello?

32:42.797 --> 32:44.264
Who's there?

33:04.652 --> 33:05.753
God, you scared me.

33:05.787 --> 33:07.622
What are you doing here?

33:12.594 --> 33:14.596
Dude, you're creeping me out.

34:01.108 --> 34:02.744
- It's my cooling towel,
it's the best I could find.

34:02.777 --> 34:03.578
- Thank you.

34:05.112 --> 34:07.314
- Okay, I have to pee.

34:10.585 --> 34:12.554
Is no one coming with?

34:12.587 --> 34:14.121
- Are you being serious?

34:14.154 --> 34:16.490
- We always have
bathroom buddies.

34:16.524 --> 34:17.457
Am I right girls?

34:20.862 --> 34:21.829
Fine.

34:21.863 --> 34:23.497
I'll go by myself.

34:23.531 --> 34:24.599
- I'm sure you'll live.

34:26.868 --> 34:28.302
- Are we still on break?

34:28.335 --> 34:29.202
- Yeah.

34:30.872 --> 34:33.206
- I'm gonna get some air.

34:33.240 --> 34:34.809
- Hey, just make sure it's
none of that funny air.

34:34.842 --> 34:35.677
Aye Quince?

34:36.911 --> 34:39.647
- If only someone hadn't
taken our phones...

34:39.681 --> 34:41.181
- Even if we did have them,

34:41.214 --> 34:42.850
it's not like we could
use them to call for help.

34:42.884 --> 34:44.217
The police would
come and arrest us

34:44.251 --> 34:45.520
and our parents would be pissed.

34:45.553 --> 34:47.387
- Especially if they
search Quincy's bag.

34:47.421 --> 34:49.356
- Why would we get arrested?

34:49.389 --> 34:51.191
- I mean, we are
breaking and entering.

34:51.224 --> 34:52.359
- But we had a key.

34:52.392 --> 34:54.294
Technically it's just entering.

34:54.328 --> 34:56.430
- Technically it's trespassing.

34:57.497 --> 34:58.733
Don't worry, if
it all goes down,

34:58.766 --> 35:00.434
at least we go down together.

35:08.543 --> 35:10.511
- Hey, thanks for
keeping me waiting.

35:12.780 --> 35:13.581
It's all here,

35:16.718 --> 35:19.386
but I want to be there for
Abby's moment of truth.

36:18.613 --> 36:19.614
- Here you go.

36:19.647 --> 36:21.248
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

36:22.717 --> 36:24.217
- Paige, are you okay?

36:24.251 --> 36:25.252
- I guess.

36:26.286 --> 36:28.255
This is all my fault, isn't it?

36:28.288 --> 36:32.426
- No way, you came through
for us and got us the key.

36:32.459 --> 36:35.797
This is on me, I'm not cut
out for this captain grab.

36:35.830 --> 36:37.297
- That's not true.

36:37.330 --> 36:38.700
What you had us doing
before Reagan got hurt

36:38.733 --> 36:39.600
was pretty great.

36:40.768 --> 36:42.369
- Wanna prank Tori?

36:42.402 --> 36:43.838
- Aren't we like,
back from break?

36:43.871 --> 36:45.506
- Sydney's still
in the washroom.

36:45.540 --> 36:48.341
Silent Stu just busted
open a bento box.

36:49.010 --> 36:50.812
He's counting his juice.

36:50.845 --> 36:51.445
We've got time.

36:52.747 --> 36:55.248
- Right, okay, let's do it.

36:55.282 --> 36:56.483
Back in five.

36:58.586 --> 37:00.487
- I guess I should
get some air too.

37:01.956 --> 37:03.024
- Okay.

37:09.496 --> 37:11.264
- Do you think Tori
is actually a Virgin?

37:11.298 --> 37:12.834
- She totally is.

37:12.867 --> 37:14.367
She's in my sister's
youth group.

37:14.401 --> 37:16.269
They took an oath for Jesus.

37:16.303 --> 37:17.772
- Okay, well does Danny know?

37:17.805 --> 37:19.741
'Cause he's been practically
dry humping the walls

37:19.774 --> 37:21.241
every time she walks by.

37:25.747 --> 37:27.882
- Tori.

37:27.915 --> 37:29.884
- Oh my God, that is so creepy.

37:29.917 --> 37:30.752
- Tori.

38:05.953 --> 38:07.054
- If this is a "Saw" thing,

38:07.088 --> 38:08.890
I'm totally not
cutting off my leg.

38:10.057 --> 38:12.794
Mateo, this isn't funny!

38:12.827 --> 38:14.427
It really hurts.

39:04.178 --> 39:05.580
- Hey, where are we?

39:05.613 --> 39:08.983
- How do I know, I
was following you.

39:09.016 --> 39:10.718
- I was following you.

39:10.751 --> 39:11.853
- Ugh.

40:06.641 --> 40:07.474
- Hello?

40:09.476 --> 40:10.678
Cheer buddies?

40:13.614 --> 40:14.481
Hey.

40:15.650 --> 40:17.484
That's a killer bong, dude.

40:21.255 --> 40:22.455
Not cool.

40:23.624 --> 40:24.491
Man.

40:28.963 --> 40:32.499
- Hey, is that Quincy?

40:32.533 --> 40:33.734
- What's he doing?

40:36.871 --> 40:39.907
- That's why we don't
have to stunt, Quincy.

40:41.909 --> 40:44.512
He's definitely broken.

40:49.817 --> 40:53.521
- Oh my God, is that
Tori, you think?

40:55.122 --> 40:56.724
- What a dog.

41:10.805 --> 41:13.908
- Ew, is he making
out with the door?

41:13.941 --> 41:16.978
- That or Tori is
working her magic.

41:17.011 --> 41:18.512
- Okay, TMI.

41:19.680 --> 41:20.581
Ooh, let's head back.

41:20.614 --> 41:21.916
I need brain bleach.

41:34.628 --> 41:38.632
- Yo, so you're turning
left at the next street.

41:38.666 --> 41:40.868
Uh, where are we going?

41:43.337 --> 41:44.772
Please tell me we're
not going to Abby's.

41:44.805 --> 41:46.674
- We're not going to Abby's.

41:46.707 --> 41:49.110
- Scott, you've gotta stop
with the stalker vibes, dude.

41:49.143 --> 41:50.277
You're starting
to make it weird.

41:50.311 --> 41:52.646
- Did I say we're
going to Abby's?

41:52.680 --> 41:54.015
Unless you want to go to Abby's.

41:54.048 --> 41:56.884
- Oh no, Abby's your
fixation dude, not mine.

41:56.917 --> 41:57.752
Okay chief.

41:59.620 --> 42:01.522
Ooh, now Victoria,
on the other hand.

42:02.289 --> 42:03.958
Look at this text she sent me.

42:05.726 --> 42:08.229
- Right, so into you.

42:08.262 --> 42:10.765
- Dammit, got a
charger somewhere?

42:10.798 --> 42:12.833
- Nope, sorry.
- My phone just died.

42:12.867 --> 42:15.836
Hey yo, dude,
where are we going?

42:15.870 --> 42:17.638
- We're going to McKayla's.

42:17.671 --> 42:20.808
I forgot, but Abby wanted
me to go check up on her.

42:22.943 --> 42:24.145
- Dude.

42:24.178 --> 42:25.946
Atta boy, yes.

42:25.980 --> 42:27.815
You're like a lion, man.

42:27.848 --> 42:28.517
- I'm not--

42:28.549 --> 42:30.151
- Rebound that shit, be proud.

42:31.352 --> 42:33.120
Say it, I'm rebounding it.

42:33.154 --> 42:34.688
- That's not what I'm doing.

42:34.722 --> 42:35.823
- I'm rebounding it.

42:37.091 --> 42:38.893
- Five, six, seven, eight.

42:38.926 --> 42:42.696
- Knee, stronger,
half T, V, clean.

42:42.730 --> 42:45.299
- Guys, that's never gonna
beat the Green Knights.

42:45.332 --> 42:47.201
- Okay, let's do it again.

42:47.234 --> 42:49.370
Five, six, seven, eight.

42:49.403 --> 42:52.339
- Knee, X,
half T, V, clean.

42:52.373 --> 42:54.008
- Okay, so in case anyone cares,

42:54.041 --> 42:56.811
Quincy's so high he's making
out with a glass door.

42:56.844 --> 42:59.080
- That or he is
getting down with Tori.

42:59.113 --> 43:01.916
So no ice for Reagan, I guess.

43:01.949 --> 43:04.785
- It's all right, I'll just
start stretching it out.

43:04.819 --> 43:07.955
- Okay guys, the bus picks
us up at 5:00 AM sharp.

43:07.988 --> 43:10.024
We're running on a time
to get it together,

43:10.057 --> 43:11.025
so let's up our game.

43:12.326 --> 43:13.961
Basket toss.

43:13.994 --> 43:14.895
- Uh, how?

43:14.929 --> 43:16.730
We barely have enough
people to toss it.

43:16.764 --> 43:18.199
- We only need four.

43:18.232 --> 43:21.235
Paige flies, Jackie and Stu
base, and Mateo back spots.

43:21.268 --> 43:22.369
- Aye aye, co-captain.

43:22.403 --> 43:23.871
We're on it.
- Thank you.

43:25.039 --> 43:25.873
- Let's go, Paige.

43:27.141 --> 43:27.942
- Ready?

43:29.210 --> 43:30.778
- Can I start with a lift?

43:30.811 --> 43:32.346
- Okay, let's do lifts.

43:32.379 --> 43:33.247
- Okay.

43:33.280 --> 43:34.882
- All right, set up.

43:35.749 --> 43:36.417
Okay, you ready?

43:36.450 --> 43:37.852
- Yeah.
- Yep.

43:37.885 --> 43:40.721
- One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

43:40.754 --> 43:42.256
- Yes, Paige.
- Good job!

43:42.289 --> 43:43.657
Good Job.

43:43.691 --> 43:44.658
Now the toss.

43:44.692 --> 43:45.326
You've got it.

43:45.359 --> 43:47.128
- Um, just hold.

43:49.063 --> 43:50.931
- Are you okay?

43:50.965 --> 43:51.799
- Sorry.

43:53.300 --> 43:54.702
- Jackie, are you okay?

43:54.735 --> 43:55.769
- That was a mess.

43:55.803 --> 43:56.937
- Okay guys, let's take 10.

43:56.971 --> 43:57.805
Okay?

44:00.407 --> 44:02.409
- Jackie, are you okay?

44:02.443 --> 44:05.179
- I'm fine, I'm just
going to the bathroom.

44:05.212 --> 44:06.814
- Um, guys.

44:09.183 --> 44:11.752
- I'm sorry guys, it's my fault.

44:11.785 --> 44:13.020
I'm not ready to fly, no way.

44:13.053 --> 44:15.689
- No, it's not
your fault freshie.

44:16.857 --> 44:18.959
We could have
spotted you better.

44:18.993 --> 44:19.927
- Hey guys.

44:21.095 --> 44:21.929
- What is it?

44:24.131 --> 44:25.166
- Look at this.

44:27.101 --> 44:28.903
- The ultimate
cheer competition.

44:31.338 --> 44:32.840
- Did you make this?

44:33.874 --> 44:35.342
- Of course I didn't make that.

44:35.376 --> 44:37.178
I just found it by the bags.

44:37.211 --> 44:38.846
- Is this supposed to be us?

44:38.879 --> 44:41.048
I mean, klutzy nerd, that's...

44:42.216 --> 44:43.450
- Why?

44:43.484 --> 44:45.819
Because I take AP English?

44:45.853 --> 44:47.721
You know what, you're a
complete blatherskite.

44:47.755 --> 44:49.123
- Pardon me?

44:49.156 --> 44:51.992
- In terms you may
understand, hashtag screw you.

44:52.026 --> 44:53.861
- Guys, stop it.

44:55.262 --> 44:58.465
- I heard the football
team did this once.

44:58.499 --> 44:59.934
Points for whoever sleeps

44:59.967 --> 45:01.468
with certain
cheerleaders or whatever.

45:01.503 --> 45:02.836
- It's a sex list?

45:04.805 --> 45:06.307
I don't want to
sleep with anyone.

45:06.340 --> 45:07.808
- Like ever?

45:10.244 --> 45:11.812
- Jackie?

45:14.381 --> 45:15.816
- Is she knocked out?

45:15.849 --> 45:17.284
- It looks like it.

45:20.387 --> 45:22.056
- Did she slip?

45:22.089 --> 45:26.060
- Yeah, right after she
got stuck in a bear trap.

45:27.962 --> 45:30.798
Why is there even a
bear trap in here?

45:34.569 --> 45:37.838
- Hey guys, I think
I found our phones.

45:37.871 --> 45:40.808
- Ew, I am
so not touching that.

45:47.815 --> 45:50.484
- Did anyone bring any rice?

45:50.518 --> 45:51.919
- Help me turn her over.

45:52.554 --> 45:53.454
Slowly.

46:14.576 --> 46:17.278
- #Cheerslay does not mean sex.

46:17.311 --> 46:18.513
- What?

46:18.546 --> 46:20.948
- The list, somebody
is trying to kill us.

46:20.981 --> 46:23.083
- This is so messed up.
- We have to get out of here!

46:23.117 --> 46:24.586
- Everyone, grab your
things and follow me.

46:24.619 --> 46:26.554
- Wait, what about
Tori and Quincy?

46:26.588 --> 46:28.489
- We'll catch them
on the way out.

46:28.523 --> 46:30.824
Come on, let's go!

46:35.329 --> 46:37.532
- I know a door that's close!

46:39.233 --> 46:40.568
He chained this door.

46:40.602 --> 46:42.036
- Oh my God, we're so dead.

46:42.069 --> 46:43.871
- Let's go to the front door.

46:46.874 --> 46:48.909
- I can't believe someone's
trying to kill us.

46:48.942 --> 46:50.077
- I know, it's that creepy guy

46:50.110 --> 46:51.312
that's always eye groping Abby.

46:51.345 --> 46:52.980
- Evan, his name is Evan

46:53.013 --> 46:55.049
and he does have
serious stalker vibes.

46:55.082 --> 46:56.250
- What if it's the ghost
to the dead cheerleader?

46:56.283 --> 46:58.553
- Since when do
ghosts chain up doors?

46:58.586 --> 46:59.453
- No!,

47:00.921 --> 47:02.356
- Oh my God, were
the chains on sale?

47:03.390 --> 47:04.858
- We're all gonna die.

47:04.892 --> 47:06.561
- Zip it Paige,
we're not gonna die.

47:06.594 --> 47:07.861
- What are we gonna do Abby?

47:07.895 --> 47:09.263
- Back to the gym.

47:09.296 --> 47:10.898
At least in there, we can
see if anyone's coming at us.

47:14.502 --> 47:16.103
- Wait.

47:16.136 --> 47:16.970
Abby, wait.

47:18.238 --> 47:20.642
If Sydney is the ditz,
and the ditz is dead,

47:20.675 --> 47:21.975
then who's next?

47:23.477 --> 47:25.580
- Stoner.
- Quincy.

47:25.613 --> 47:27.314
- Slut.

47:27.348 --> 47:28.182
- Tori.

47:28.982 --> 47:30.184
Well, sort of.

47:30.217 --> 47:31.452
- This better not
be based on looks.

47:31.485 --> 47:34.988
- Stoner, slut and basic bitch
all have check marks by them.

47:36.957 --> 47:38.292
- Dang.

47:38.325 --> 47:41.362
- They're the targets
and we have to find them

47:41.395 --> 47:42.396
before the killer does.

47:49.370 --> 47:50.270
- McKayla!

47:51.539 --> 47:52.640
Hey, you in there?

47:52.674 --> 47:53.874
You home?

47:56.678 --> 47:59.146
- Well, not here, let's go.

47:59.179 --> 47:59.681
- Hey, wait.

47:59.714 --> 48:00.881
- Trick or treat.

48:02.015 --> 48:05.386
- Sorry little
dudes, no one's home.

48:05.419 --> 48:07.421
- And they didn't
leave any candy out?

48:07.454 --> 48:09.323
Candy hoarders.

48:09.356 --> 48:10.658
Hey, where's your head?

48:10.692 --> 48:12.393
- Can you guys
just like, bug off?

48:15.563 --> 48:17.398
All right, come on back.

48:18.432 --> 48:20.602
- Yo, where are you going?

48:23.705 --> 48:25.005
- Maybe they already left.

48:25.038 --> 48:26.473
- Or maybe they're already dead.

48:31.245 --> 48:33.280
- We should split up
and look for them.

48:33.313 --> 48:36.483
- Oh hell no, that's how you
get killed in horror movies.

48:36.518 --> 48:38.720
- Unless the killer's one of us.

48:38.753 --> 48:40.522
- Whoa, dude.

48:44.258 --> 48:46.994
- Okay, he's been with
us this this entire time.

48:47.027 --> 48:48.195
What about you Mateo?

48:48.228 --> 48:49.329
You've been in and
out of this gym.

48:49.363 --> 48:50.330
- Stop it.

48:50.364 --> 48:51.566
We're not gonna point
fingers at each other.

48:51.599 --> 48:53.167
It doesn't help.

48:53.200 --> 48:55.235
What we need to do is
find the rest of the team

48:55.269 --> 48:57.304
and find a way out of
this place, together.

48:57.337 --> 48:58.338
Copy?

48:58.372 --> 48:59.707
- Reagan should stay
here, she can barely walk.

48:59.741 --> 49:00.708
- Right.

49:00.742 --> 49:02.342
Jackie, stay with Reagan.

49:02.376 --> 49:04.679
Mateo, Paige, and
Stu, you come with me.

49:04.712 --> 49:07.181
If we get separated,
everyone meet back here.

49:08.583 --> 49:09.349
Put 'em in.

49:12.419 --> 49:13.721
Diablos on three.

49:13.755 --> 49:15.557
- One, two, Diablos.

49:17.391 --> 49:18.358
- That's her bedroom.

49:19.359 --> 49:22.329
- Bro, why do you know
where her bedroom is?

49:22.362 --> 49:23.497
- Abby told me.

49:23.531 --> 49:25.065
- Yeah, I'm sure she told you

49:25.098 --> 49:27.100
where all of her friend's
bedroom windows are,

49:27.134 --> 49:28.503
'cause that's totally normal.

49:29.771 --> 49:32.507
Hey yo, stop being such a creep.

49:32.540 --> 49:33.741
If they're not here, let's go.

49:33.775 --> 49:35.442
- Can you just be quiet?

49:46.554 --> 49:48.055
Elk Moore High School.

49:49.122 --> 49:50.525
- Okay, so what,
they're at school?

49:50.558 --> 49:53.460
- No, not our school, dude.

49:53.494 --> 49:55.630
It has to be the old
Elk Moore High School.

49:55.663 --> 49:56.664
- No, no, no, no, no.

49:56.698 --> 49:58.432
Dude, that place has salmonella.

49:58.465 --> 49:59.366
We're not gonna go there.

49:59.399 --> 50:01.134
It literally oozes
out of the walls, man.

50:01.168 --> 50:03.070
- Well take a Pepto, let's go.

50:04.338 --> 50:05.372
- A Pepto?

50:05.405 --> 50:07.074
- I swear if she's
there with him,

50:07.107 --> 50:08.475
I'm gonna kill him.

50:08.510 --> 50:10.512
- Hey, dude, you said if
the girls weren't here

50:10.545 --> 50:11.613
it's party time.

50:13.447 --> 50:14.682
- Abby.

50:14.716 --> 50:16.083
What should we do
if we see someone?

50:16.116 --> 50:18.418
Do we attack or do
we get all tough?

50:18.452 --> 50:20.153
Like, freeze!

50:20.187 --> 50:21.556
- It depends on the situation.

50:23.156 --> 50:25.359
- So maybe we make a scale.

50:25.392 --> 50:29.196
Like an unarmed
girl scout is a one.

50:29.229 --> 50:33.200
And an ax wielding
madman is a 10.

50:34.569 --> 50:35.469
So if you call 10,

50:35.503 --> 50:37.271
that's run from an ax.

50:38.573 --> 50:41.408
And level one could be beat the
shit out of that girl scout.

50:43.545 --> 50:47.080
I don't know what a girl scout
with an ax would be though.

50:47.114 --> 50:48.550
There'd be a six.

50:50.852 --> 50:52.554
Tori.

50:52.587 --> 50:54.288
- Tori!
- Where is she?

50:57.491 --> 50:58.325
Where are you?

51:08.335 --> 51:09.704
- Do you think Tori is in there?

51:09.737 --> 51:12.105
- I guess we're gonna find out.

51:13.173 --> 51:14.441
- I'm scared, Abby.

51:14.474 --> 51:15.475
- Hey.

51:15.510 --> 51:16.644
Hey, it's okay.

51:16.678 --> 51:18.813
- Is it okay, is it really?

51:18.846 --> 51:20.882
- We're all scared,

51:20.915 --> 51:23.250
but we have to remember
that none of us is alone.

51:23.283 --> 51:24.418
We have each other.

51:25.285 --> 51:26.386
We have to trust each other

51:26.420 --> 51:29.156
and know we have each
other's backs no matter what.

51:29.189 --> 51:31.358
That's what cheer is all about.

51:31.391 --> 51:33.427
Can you trust us
to keep you safe?

51:34.896 --> 51:35.763
- Yeah.

51:35.797 --> 51:36.631
- Good.

51:38.633 --> 51:40.233
Okay, here we go.

51:56.651 --> 51:59.186
- Worst spirit fingers ever.

52:02.757 --> 52:03.558
Don't touch that.

52:05.760 --> 52:07.494
- Are we ready?

52:07.528 --> 52:08.395
- Does it matter?

52:16.436 --> 52:17.839
I call a 10.

52:24.344 --> 52:25.647
- We need to find Quincy!

52:25.680 --> 52:26.914
- I bet he's dead too!

52:26.948 --> 52:28.583
- He's alive, he has to be.

52:30.952 --> 52:32.553
This way!

52:34.421 --> 52:36.891
- Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God.

52:36.924 --> 52:38.693
- Oh my God, oh my God.

52:41.996 --> 52:44.899
- Oh a 10, right,
that's definitely a 10.

52:44.932 --> 52:46.400
He better be here to cheer.

52:55.510 --> 52:56.711
Everybody run!

53:09.322 --> 53:10.725
- You know, if I
am the klutzy nerd,

53:10.758 --> 53:13.393
I don't see why I'm
only worth five points.

53:13.427 --> 53:14.829
I mean, you're worth eight.

53:14.862 --> 53:15.697
- Wait, which one am I?

53:15.730 --> 53:17.330
- The jock.

53:17.364 --> 53:19.934
Well, unless you're a
badass, and that's worth 12.

53:19.967 --> 53:21.268
- You think?

53:22.503 --> 53:24.872
I mean, maybe you're
the klutzy nerd.

53:24.906 --> 53:27.340
But you could also
be the sexy blonde.

53:28.275 --> 53:29.476
That's worth 10 points.

53:32.279 --> 53:33.514
- Yeah.

53:44.058 --> 53:44.892
- Hey, hey!

53:44.926 --> 53:46.326
- What?

53:46.359 --> 53:49.597
- See, see, Evan
slenderman's car.

53:49.630 --> 53:50.198
- Okay, so what?

53:50.230 --> 53:51.666
- I knew it, I knew it.

53:52.633 --> 53:53.601
- Hey, easy.

53:53.634 --> 53:54.936
- I'm gonna kill him.
- What are you doing?

53:54.969 --> 53:56.738
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Hey, hey.

54:01.676 --> 54:03.678
- The ladies are
waiting man, come on.

54:07.915 --> 54:09.050
No dice.

54:09.083 --> 54:10.051
- Wait, hold up.

54:17.725 --> 54:18.893
- Is that a crowbar?

54:18.926 --> 54:20.728
- A boy scout's always prepared.

54:20.762 --> 54:22.362
- Yeah, you know, I'm
thinking less boy scout,

54:22.395 --> 54:23.865
more Ted Bundy on that one.

54:23.898 --> 54:24.732
- Whatever.

54:26.934 --> 54:28.468
- You need some help?

54:28.503 --> 54:29.336
- No.

54:35.777 --> 54:36.611
After you.

54:37.578 --> 54:38.411
- Bro.

54:39.714 --> 54:41.749
Is this really the
look you're going for?

54:45.920 --> 54:47.021
- Better?

54:47.054 --> 54:47.889
- Marginally.

54:49.524 --> 54:50.792
Okay.

54:52.860 --> 54:53.861
- I'm going up, dude.

54:55.797 --> 54:56.998
- Okay.

54:59.700 --> 55:00.635
Help!

55:02.036 --> 55:03.604
- Did you hear that?

55:03.638 --> 55:04.939
- Hear what?

55:04.972 --> 55:06.574
- It's Abby.

55:06.607 --> 55:07.374
- Where?

55:07.407 --> 55:08.475
Help!

55:09.110 --> 55:10.745
- See, you hear that?

55:15.382 --> 55:18.686
- If this is what love
is, I want no part of it.

55:18.719 --> 55:20.087
Okay?
- Come on.

55:20.121 --> 55:21.689
- What are you,
telapathetic or something?

55:21.722 --> 55:22.590
- Let's go!

55:22.623 --> 55:23.456
- Okay.

55:24.125 --> 55:25.092
- This way.
- Okay.

55:31.666 --> 55:33.634
- Quincy!

55:33.668 --> 55:34.735
Quincy, wake up!

55:41.676 --> 55:42.844
- Hey Abbs.

55:42.877 --> 55:43.744
- Oh my God.

55:43.778 --> 55:44.979
- Hey.

55:45.012 --> 55:47.682
- I'm so sorry, this
is all my fault.

55:50.084 --> 55:51.619
- This isn't you.

55:57.091 --> 56:00.728
Our souls are like
drops of water

56:03.898 --> 56:05.633
and we return to the ocean.

56:08.936 --> 56:10.504
I see everything.

56:12.139 --> 56:12.773
Almost.

56:15.910 --> 56:18.880
Can you reach into my pocket?

56:34.461 --> 56:35.963
Too late.

56:35.997 --> 56:36.831
Bummer.

56:43.571 --> 56:45.472
- Oh, Quincy, Quincy?

56:52.813 --> 56:53.480
I'm sorry.

57:00.721 --> 57:02.690
- Hey, I think we lost him!

57:04.058 --> 57:06.060
Stu, Paige?

57:23.177 --> 57:26.514
Oh, what are you
gonna do now Hawkeye?

57:29.016 --> 57:31.986
Dang, I did not see that coming.

57:41.262 --> 57:42.830
- Hey yo, bathroom.

57:42.863 --> 57:44.799
Okay, I gotta go freshen
up and gotta take a leak.

57:44.832 --> 57:46.267
There's a lot going
on in my body.

57:46.300 --> 57:47.835
- Yeah, but it takes
forever in that costume.

57:47.868 --> 57:49.704
- Okay, well one
second, okay bro?

57:50.571 --> 57:52.106
- One second, bro.

57:52.139 --> 57:52.974
As if.

57:57.912 --> 57:58.980
- Help!

58:00.781 --> 58:01.615
- Abby?

58:04.685 --> 58:06.053
- Does this go outside?

58:08.856 --> 58:10.191
- Abby?

58:10.224 --> 58:11.058
- Scott?

58:13.894 --> 58:14.895
- Abby?

58:14.929 --> 58:16.230
- Scott!

58:19.300 --> 58:20.501
- Abby?

58:22.203 --> 58:23.037
- Scott!

58:26.941 --> 58:27.675
Scott!

58:41.322 --> 58:42.223
Scott?

59:33.074 --> 59:34.108
McKayla?

59:34.141 --> 59:35.943
- Abby, listen.

59:35.976 --> 59:36.877
I can explain.

59:36.911 --> 59:37.978
- You asshole.

59:39.380 --> 59:42.183
- Hey, it's not
what it looks like.

59:43.217 --> 59:44.752
Okay?

59:44.785 --> 59:47.955
McKayla and I, Abby, just--
- Scott!

59:59.266 --> 1:00:00.267
- Get outta here!

1:00:00.301 --> 1:00:01.869
Run!

1:00:01.902 --> 1:00:02.736
Go!

1:00:09.009 --> 1:00:10.411
Who are you, huh?

1:00:18.252 --> 1:00:20.221
Is that you Evan?

1:00:20.254 --> 1:00:21.889
You creepy mother--

1:00:43.177 --> 1:00:44.044
- Scott?

1:00:51.152 --> 1:00:51.919
- Scott?

1:00:54.088 --> 1:00:54.922
Scotty?

1:00:57.258 --> 1:00:58.058
Scotty?

1:01:00.728 --> 1:01:02.229
Oh, time to get laid.

1:01:04.064 --> 1:01:04.999
Woo!

1:01:09.170 --> 1:01:10.037
- Danny?

1:01:10.070 --> 1:01:11.939
- Whoa, hey, Mateo.

1:01:11.972 --> 1:01:12.706
- Danny!

1:01:12.740 --> 1:01:13.440
Where's your phone?

1:01:13.474 --> 1:01:14.308
- It's dead, dude.

1:01:14.341 --> 1:01:16.076
Why are you so hectic?

1:01:16.110 --> 1:01:18.913
- It's Tori, she's dead.

1:01:18.946 --> 1:01:23.050
- Dude, we were literally
texting this morning.

1:01:23.083 --> 1:01:24.251
That's a cool trick.

1:01:24.285 --> 1:01:25.119
- Ow!

1:01:26.820 --> 1:01:29.223
There's a psycho killer on
the loose and they got her.

1:01:29.256 --> 1:01:30.758
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1:01:30.791 --> 1:01:31.859
Dude, I get it.

1:01:31.892 --> 1:01:32.826
You can drop the skit.

1:01:32.860 --> 1:01:35.462
It's Halloween, ooh, ah!

1:01:35.496 --> 1:01:38.065
Seriously though
dude, where is she?

1:01:38.098 --> 1:01:40.868
Okay, tonight is the night
that we consummate our love.

1:01:40.901 --> 1:01:43.304
- Dude, it's not happening.

1:01:44.539 --> 1:01:46.140
- Right, yeah,
'cause she's dead.

1:01:46.173 --> 1:01:48.409
- Bro, I swear she is!

1:01:48.442 --> 1:01:49.210
- Yeah, okay.

1:01:50.512 --> 1:01:52.980
- You know she was
a Virgin, right?

1:01:53.013 --> 1:01:53.847
- What?

1:01:54.549 --> 1:01:56.483
Like zero penises?

1:01:56.518 --> 1:01:57.318
- None.

1:01:59.119 --> 1:01:59.954
- No.

1:02:01.789 --> 1:02:02.890
No, that's impossible.

1:02:02.923 --> 1:02:07.094
Dude, she literally
texted me tacos.

1:02:07.127 --> 1:02:08.963
Tacos.

1:02:08.996 --> 1:02:09.863
- Sorry.

1:02:11.298 --> 1:02:12.866
- That's just not fair.

1:02:15.903 --> 1:02:18.072
Not fair at all, dude.

1:02:19.373 --> 1:02:20.841
- Okay, who is that?

1:02:27.014 --> 1:02:29.817
- Dude, does it look bad?

1:02:36.190 --> 1:02:38.392
- Stu you're back,
where's Abby and Mateo?

1:02:38.425 --> 1:02:39.793
- Tori and Quincy are dead.

1:02:39.827 --> 1:02:40.894
- Oh my God!

1:02:41.895 --> 1:02:42.830
- Danny is dead.

1:02:42.863 --> 1:02:44.398
Abby, you're alive!

1:02:44.431 --> 1:02:46.267
- Mateo, you're bleeding.

1:02:49.837 --> 1:02:50.904
- It's the devil mascot.

1:02:50.938 --> 1:02:53.007
He shot me with his arrow.

1:02:53.040 --> 1:02:53.608
I'm dying.

1:02:53.642 --> 1:02:54.475
- You're not gonna die.

1:02:54.509 --> 1:02:55.809
Here, let me see.

1:02:59.913 --> 1:03:01.583
I'm just gonna--
- Count until the warning!

1:03:01.616 --> 1:03:03.917
Count down before
you amputate my arm.

1:03:03.951 --> 1:03:07.421
- Just breathe, breathe.

1:03:07.454 --> 1:03:09.156
- Super absorbent
and with wings.

1:03:10.457 --> 1:03:11.825
- Good job, Jackie.

1:03:11.859 --> 1:03:12.860
- Help!

1:03:19.534 --> 1:03:20.934
- Who are you?

1:03:21.536 --> 1:03:23.137
Evan, is that you?

1:03:24.238 --> 1:03:26.240
- Abby, I think
I know who it is.

1:03:28.510 --> 1:03:29.943
- Paige, what are you doing?

1:03:29.977 --> 1:03:31.845
- Anyone move and I'll kill her.

1:03:31.879 --> 1:03:32.913
- No!

1:03:37.652 --> 1:03:38.852
- Evee?

1:03:38.886 --> 1:03:40.854
- Sorry about your boyfriend.

1:03:40.888 --> 1:03:44.526
But face it, he was
just a cheating jock.

1:03:44.559 --> 1:03:45.893
10 points for me.

1:03:46.960 --> 1:03:49.263
No points for dead
slenderman though.

1:03:49.296 --> 1:03:50.331
- You killed Evan?

1:03:51.533 --> 1:03:53.601
- Poor Evan, trying so hard

1:03:53.635 --> 1:03:57.071
to relive your
elementary school years.

1:03:57.104 --> 1:04:00.040
You know, it was his idea
to film El Jocko there

1:04:00.074 --> 1:04:02.109
screwing around with your BFF.

1:04:03.243 --> 1:04:04.278
That has to sting.

1:04:05.245 --> 1:04:06.113
- Screw you.

1:04:07.981 --> 1:04:10.184
- Counting the McKayla
kill, I'm still winning.

1:04:10.217 --> 1:04:11.485
- You don't get full
points for McKayla.

1:04:11.519 --> 1:04:12.886
We did that one together.

1:04:12.920 --> 1:04:13.621
- McKayla?

1:04:21.696 --> 1:04:23.230
Paige, let her go.

1:04:23.263 --> 1:04:25.332
- You don't get
to call the shots.

1:04:25.366 --> 1:04:28.302
We're in charge now, and
I say we split that kill.

1:04:28.335 --> 1:04:30.638
- All you were supposed to
do was ring the doorbell.

1:04:30.672 --> 1:04:31.639
I didn't need your help.

1:04:31.673 --> 1:04:32.940
- You wish, four points each.

1:04:32.973 --> 1:04:34.408
No points for Scott.

1:04:34.441 --> 1:04:37.311
- He's a jock, 10 points.

1:04:37.344 --> 1:04:39.079
- No substitutions.

1:04:39.113 --> 1:04:41.382
- Paige, you're one of us.

1:04:41.415 --> 1:04:42.316
- One of you?

1:04:42.349 --> 1:04:43.917
Don't flatter yourself.

1:04:47.321 --> 1:04:49.691
I can't believe that dumb
cheerleader stereotype

1:04:49.724 --> 1:04:51.526
is actually true.

1:04:51.559 --> 1:04:52.426
- Paige, please.

1:04:52.459 --> 1:04:53.394
- Let's get them!

1:04:55.663 --> 1:04:58.031
- Everyone, on the steps, now.

1:04:58.065 --> 1:04:59.199
Let's just do what they say.

1:04:59.233 --> 1:05:01.301
- Please don't do this Paige!

1:05:01.335 --> 1:05:02.403
- Okay.

1:05:02.436 --> 1:05:04.071
Story time, boys and girls.

1:05:09.577 --> 1:05:12.913
- 20 years ago, there was a
very talented cheerleader.

1:05:14.214 --> 1:05:16.350
All the other cheerleaders
wanted to be just like her.

1:05:17.484 --> 1:05:20.454
So one day at regionals,
her team sabotaged her.

1:05:20.487 --> 1:05:22.489
- Woo, Sandra!

1:05:26.728 --> 1:05:27.695
- She fell from the
top of the pyramid

1:05:27.729 --> 1:05:29.062
and snapped her neck.

1:05:30.998 --> 1:05:32.433
Her twin sister watched her die.

1:05:34.435 --> 1:05:38.038
She never got over it
and she never forgave.

1:05:38.071 --> 1:05:41.208
So when she had twin
daughters of her own...

1:05:41.241 --> 1:05:45.012
- Your auntie Sandra
will be avenged.

1:05:46.013 --> 1:05:47.281
Say it.

1:05:47.314 --> 1:05:50.184
- Auntie
Sandra will be avenged.

1:05:50.217 --> 1:05:51.485
- She trained us.

1:05:52.720 --> 1:05:54.288
- Your fishing trips.

1:05:54.321 --> 1:05:56.758
- Survivalist training
camps, thank you very much.

1:05:56.791 --> 1:05:58.593
We learned it all.

1:05:58.626 --> 1:06:02.396
Hunting, trapping, killing.

1:06:03.430 --> 1:06:04.965
- Every damned weekend.

1:06:06.734 --> 1:06:09.637
You cheerleaders walk around
with your nose jobs in the air

1:06:09.671 --> 1:06:11.472
like you're gifts
to this school.

1:06:11.506 --> 1:06:14.074
- Wait, you're doing all this
because you hate cheerleaders?

1:06:14.107 --> 1:06:17.144
- Not just cheerleaders,
that cheerleader.

1:06:19.747 --> 1:06:22.115
Your mom was cheer
captain of the Diablos.

1:06:24.719 --> 1:06:27.287
She was so jealous
of our Auntie Sandra,

1:06:27.321 --> 1:06:29.423
she killed her rather
than letting her shine.

1:06:31.258 --> 1:06:34.361
- I know what she
did and I am sorry.

1:06:34.394 --> 1:06:37.331
I've done everything I can
not to be anything like her.

1:06:37.364 --> 1:06:41.301
- So you're telling me,
Abby's mom killed your aunt?

1:06:41.335 --> 1:06:43.303
And so Principal
Simmons outlawed stunts

1:06:43.337 --> 1:06:46.106
and groomed you
two into psychos?

1:06:54.549 --> 1:06:56.651
- Auntie Sandra will be avenged.

1:06:56.684 --> 1:06:58.252
The Diablos have to die.

1:06:59.152 --> 1:07:02.256
So when do we start the game?

1:07:02.289 --> 1:07:03.357
- What are
you talking about?

1:07:03.390 --> 1:07:04.792
- You guys like
cheering for games,

1:07:04.826 --> 1:07:07.829
so we came up with a
little game of our own.

1:07:07.862 --> 1:07:08.796
It's called--

1:07:08.830 --> 1:07:10.632
- Cheer or die.

1:07:13.668 --> 1:07:15.335
- Here's the rules.

1:07:15.369 --> 1:07:19.172
Cheer, perfect form, or die.

1:07:19.807 --> 1:07:20.642
It's simple.

1:07:24.111 --> 1:07:26.179
Now get your ass up there, jock.

1:07:27.247 --> 1:07:28.148
- Jackie, see, I was right.

1:07:28.181 --> 1:07:29.684
You are the jock.

1:07:29.717 --> 1:07:32.419
- Wait, if Jackie's a jock...

1:07:33.387 --> 1:07:36.658
Oh my God, am I the sexy blonde?

1:07:37.592 --> 1:07:38.458
Am I right?

1:07:40.595 --> 1:07:42.864
Wait, how is the badass
worth more points than I am?

1:07:42.897 --> 1:07:44.832
- Jackie, you're up.

1:07:58.412 --> 1:08:00.882
Kick, kick, split, fish, blop.

1:08:00.915 --> 1:08:03.651
- How do you even
do that altogether?

1:08:03.685 --> 1:08:07.154
- Jackie, I've seen you
do all those things.

1:08:12.660 --> 1:08:16.664
- Jackie,
Jackie, Jackie, Jackie.

1:08:16.698 --> 1:08:19.366
Jackie, Jackie, Jackie, Jackie.

1:08:20.702 --> 1:08:23.337
Jackie, Jackie, Jackie, Jackie.

1:08:24.672 --> 1:08:26.507
Jackie, Jackie, Jackie!

1:08:29.242 --> 1:08:30.612
- Yes Jackie!

1:08:38.686 --> 1:08:41.154
- Mateo, you're up.

1:08:42.489 --> 1:08:45.693
Let's see a back
handspring step out.

1:08:45.727 --> 1:08:46.861
- Can I have a running start?

1:08:46.894 --> 1:08:47.895
- From standing.

1:08:47.929 --> 1:08:49.530
- Hello, I'm injured.

1:08:49.564 --> 1:08:50.632
- Boohoo.

1:08:53.668 --> 1:08:55.536
- Mateo, you can do it.

1:08:55.570 --> 1:08:56.571
Just concentrate.

1:08:57.805 --> 1:08:59.574
- Mateo, Mateo, Mateo.

1:09:12.553 --> 1:09:13.554
- Everybody shut up!

1:09:25.700 --> 1:09:28.201
Back handspring back tuck.

1:09:38.713 --> 1:09:39.547
Look out!

1:09:43.250 --> 1:09:44.819
- Bravo, badass.

1:09:44.852 --> 1:09:46.420
Who's next?

1:09:46.453 --> 1:09:49.423
- I say it's the klutzy nerd.

1:09:50.858 --> 1:09:52.325
You're up!

1:09:52.359 --> 1:09:54.562
Round off back walkover.

1:09:54.595 --> 1:09:55.763
- What?

1:09:55.797 --> 1:09:56.631
- I'll go.

1:09:58.032 --> 1:09:59.332
Reagan is injured.

1:09:59.366 --> 1:10:01.703
- Round off, back walkover.

1:10:01.736 --> 1:10:03.504
- Oh, come on.

1:10:03.538 --> 1:10:05.973
I thought you two were
smarter than that.

1:10:06.007 --> 1:10:08.241
I mean, you still
need a hostage, right?

1:10:10.011 --> 1:10:12.412
- Nice try, final girl.

1:10:12.446 --> 1:10:14.448
- Wait, maybe she's right.

1:10:15.550 --> 1:10:17.819
These assholes need a
little skin in the game.

1:10:23.958 --> 1:10:25.358
- My mouth!

1:10:25.392 --> 1:10:27.829
- You're done hurting
any of us, you got that?

1:10:27.862 --> 1:10:29.329
No points for you!

1:10:50.051 --> 1:10:51.251
- Reagan!

1:11:02.797 --> 1:11:04.498
- Let's cheer, bitch.

1:11:11.072 --> 1:11:13.508
- Mateo, back handspring.

1:11:13.541 --> 1:11:14.407
Back kick!

1:11:16.077 --> 1:11:17.545
Stu, toe touch.

1:11:21.414 --> 1:11:24.051
Diablos, we're outta here.

1:11:24.085 --> 1:11:25.285
- Paige?

1:11:47.975 --> 1:11:49.610
- Shit, we're still trapped.

1:11:49.644 --> 1:11:51.779
- There's another way, come on.

1:11:51.813 --> 1:11:53.815
- Why are we going up here?
- There's a courtyard upstairs.

1:11:53.848 --> 1:11:56.117
Maybe it's the way out.

1:11:56.150 --> 1:11:57.051
Here it is!

1:12:05.059 --> 1:12:06.426
- Crap, it's a dead end!

1:12:06.459 --> 1:12:08.563
- We can get on the roof.

1:12:08.596 --> 1:12:09.396
- How?

1:12:09.429 --> 1:12:10.363
- Straight up toss.

1:12:10.397 --> 1:12:11.999
- Abbs, we suck at those.

1:12:12.033 --> 1:12:14.467
- Guys, it's the only way.

1:12:15.169 --> 1:12:15.970
How's your ankle?

1:12:17.638 --> 1:12:20.473
- I can't put enough
pressure on it.

1:12:21.976 --> 1:12:23.110
- Abby.

1:12:23.144 --> 1:12:24.712
- You have to do it.

1:12:24.745 --> 1:12:25.580
- Come on.

1:12:25.613 --> 1:12:26.147
- I can't.

1:12:26.180 --> 1:12:27.582
- Please, please.

1:12:27.615 --> 1:12:29.717
- It's too high and
I can't, I can't.

1:12:29.750 --> 1:12:30.618
- You can.

1:12:33.420 --> 1:12:34.755
Come on Abbs.

1:12:34.789 --> 1:12:35.656
You are our captain.

1:12:37.091 --> 1:12:39.660
We believe in you like
you believe in us.

1:12:39.694 --> 1:12:40.761
You can do this.

1:12:42.462 --> 1:12:44.098
- You're gonna fly, captain.

1:12:44.131 --> 1:12:46.133
You've got this, Abbs.

1:12:46.167 --> 1:12:48.870
- Okay, right, I've got this.

1:12:58.846 --> 1:12:59.847
- Okay.
- Okay.

1:12:59.881 --> 1:13:00.447
- On five.

1:13:03.150 --> 1:13:04.819
- Five, six, seven, eight.

1:13:04.852 --> 1:13:07.021
- One, two,
three, four, five.

1:13:10.791 --> 1:13:11.659
- Okay.

1:13:12.927 --> 1:13:13.761
- Yes!

1:13:15.029 --> 1:13:16.631
- Go Abby, go!

1:13:23.470 --> 1:13:25.206
Yes, keep going!

1:13:30.477 --> 1:13:32.013
- I'm good!

1:13:35.683 --> 1:13:37.685
Oh God, there's a rope.

1:13:39.253 --> 1:13:40.755
At least something
is going right.

1:13:43.024 --> 1:13:43.991
Here you go.

1:13:46.160 --> 1:13:47.828
- I got it. I got it.

1:13:50.831 --> 1:13:52.533
Okay, come on.

1:13:52.566 --> 1:13:55.836
- Be careful,
careful of the foot.

1:13:55.870 --> 1:13:57.939
Careful, come on Reagan.

1:14:05.613 --> 1:14:07.882
- All right, come on Jackie.

1:14:10.017 --> 1:14:11.218
- Come on Jackie.

1:14:11.252 --> 1:14:12.153
Come on.

1:14:30.738 --> 1:14:31.772
Good job.

1:14:31.806 --> 1:14:32.707
Okay Mateo.

1:14:38.813 --> 1:14:39.981
You've got it.

1:14:43.317 --> 1:14:44.885
I'm almost there.

1:14:58.332 --> 1:14:59.834
- Abby, Abby no!

1:15:11.645 --> 1:15:13.948
- Evee, you don't
have to do this.

1:15:13.981 --> 1:15:16.217
We don't have to live
out our parents' lives.

1:15:22.356 --> 1:15:23.758
- You don't get it.

1:15:25.059 --> 1:15:28.262
This is all your fault!

1:15:31.165 --> 1:15:33.901
- Killing me won't
change anything.

1:15:33.934 --> 1:15:38.172
I mean, I get it since your
mom loves Paige so much better.

1:15:38.205 --> 1:15:41.175
- No, mommy loves me best.

1:16:10.237 --> 1:16:12.573
- You little psycho bitch.

1:16:17.011 --> 1:16:18.179
- Abby!

1:16:19.713 --> 1:16:21.849
- Get her, get her.

1:16:21.882 --> 1:16:22.850
- Abby, grab the rope.

1:16:22.883 --> 1:16:25.753
- Come on Abby!
- You can do it.

1:16:25.786 --> 1:16:27.822
- You've got this!

1:16:27.855 --> 1:16:28.856
Pull her!

1:16:37.665 --> 1:16:38.666
Oh my God.

1:16:40.134 --> 1:16:42.103
We're alive, we're alive!

1:16:51.178 --> 1:16:52.346
- Look at this!

1:16:52.379 --> 1:16:53.881
Quick, let's go!

1:16:57.318 --> 1:16:59.120
Stu, I need you to tie that.

1:16:59.153 --> 1:17:00.754
Extra tight, yeah.

1:17:03.424 --> 1:17:05.860
Yeah, come on, come on.

1:17:05.893 --> 1:17:07.027
You've got it, you've got it.

1:17:07.061 --> 1:17:08.129
- Run.

1:17:13.367 --> 1:17:14.835
Okay Stu.

1:17:14.869 --> 1:17:17.738
Okay, just, you've got this.

1:17:17.771 --> 1:17:18.439
- Pull tight.

1:17:24.211 --> 1:17:25.880
- He's down.
- Okay.

1:17:28.315 --> 1:17:29.750
- Just slow.

1:17:29.783 --> 1:17:33.087
- Don't worry
Jackie, you've got it.

1:17:33.120 --> 1:17:34.455
- Jackie.

1:17:40.961 --> 1:17:43.197
- Reagan, you're up.

1:17:44.398 --> 1:17:46.033
- Well done.

1:17:46.066 --> 1:17:48.035
You've gotta catch her, you've
gotta catch her, her ankle.

1:17:49.336 --> 1:17:50.271
- Come on Reagan.

1:18:03.217 --> 1:18:05.286
- Come on Mateo.

1:18:05.319 --> 1:18:06.921
- Yeah, just go.

1:18:14.828 --> 1:18:16.297
No, no, no, no, no.

1:18:18.365 --> 1:18:20.167
- You're almost there.

1:18:27.241 --> 1:18:28.242
Are you okay?

1:18:34.516 --> 1:18:37.218
- You killed my sister!

1:18:37.251 --> 1:18:39.086
I'm coming for you!

1:18:42.823 --> 1:18:44.358
- We're gonna have to catch her.

1:18:44.391 --> 1:18:45.192
Positions!

1:18:45.226 --> 1:18:47.294
- I've got the head.
- Yeah, feet.

1:18:48.262 --> 1:18:49.230
Ready?

1:18:49.263 --> 1:18:51.031
- Okay, yeah.

1:18:51.065 --> 1:18:52.066
- Abby, jump!

1:19:07.081 --> 1:19:08.382
- Pray for me.

1:19:40.214 --> 1:19:41.115
- Oh my God, no.

1:19:46.521 --> 1:19:47.221
Go, go, go!

1:19:48.188 --> 1:19:49.591
Go!

1:19:53.060 --> 1:19:54.161
Oh no.

1:19:56.930 --> 1:20:01.068
- Can't sneak up on a man's
personal affirmation time.

1:20:02.604 --> 1:20:03.538
Rough night, huh?

1:20:03.571 --> 1:20:04.539
- No time.

1:20:04.572 --> 1:20:06.006
Floor it, now!

1:20:06.040 --> 1:20:08.208
- Time is ours for
the taking my friend.

1:20:08.242 --> 1:20:10.444
Happiness is a state
of consciousness--

1:20:10.477 --> 1:20:11.912
- Sir!

1:20:11.945 --> 1:20:13.414
- Which proceeds from
the achievement of--

1:20:21.255 --> 1:20:23.257
- You think
you can kill my sister

1:20:23.290 --> 1:20:25.125
and just drive away?

1:20:27.428 --> 1:20:28.429
You're not going anywhere!

1:20:35.169 --> 1:20:35.903
- Gun it.

1:20:46.514 --> 1:20:49.083
- Ha ha, you missed me!

1:21:07.535 --> 1:21:09.403
- Oh God, did we just...

1:21:09.436 --> 1:21:11.071
- Vamanos Diablos.

1:21:15.943 --> 1:21:17.444
- Diablos.

1:22:42.162 --> 1:22:44.097
- Diablos, circle up.

1:22:48.101 --> 1:22:50.070
We went through a hell
of a lot last year.

1:22:50.103 --> 1:22:52.072
We lost members of
our cheer family,

1:22:52.105 --> 1:22:54.274
but they're not gone
from our hearts.

1:22:54.308 --> 1:22:57.478
They'll always be a part
of us and this team.

1:23:07.054 --> 1:23:08.556
And to all our new members,

1:23:08.590 --> 1:23:11.793
thank you all for joining this
new chapter of Diablo Cheer.

1:23:11.826 --> 1:23:13.595
Let's kick some
Green Knight butt!

1:23:13.628 --> 1:23:14.495
Bring it on!

1:23:17.064 --> 1:23:18.298
Put 'em in.

1:23:18.332 --> 1:23:21.536
One, two, Diablo!

1:23:25.405 --> 1:23:29.176
- Diablo,
Diablo, Diablo, Diablo.

1:25:49.517 --> 1:25:53.420
- The winners
in this final showdown...

1:25:53.453 --> 1:25:54.789
The Diablos!
