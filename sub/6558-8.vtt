WEBVTT

00:13.097 --> 00:14.265
Huh?

00:52.094 --> 00:53.095
Shh...

01:24.252 --> 01:26.337
Time to go, gang. It's getting dark.

01:26.504 --> 01:32.385
- Hey, let's have that last clam, Scooby.
- Coming up. Scooby-Doo!

01:35.429 --> 01:38.849
Good shot! I've heard of bird dogs
and rabbit dogs...

01:39.016 --> 01:41.727
but you're the first clam dog
I ever heard of.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.771
Clam dog?

01:43.938 --> 01:45.189
Yuck.

01:45.523 --> 01:47.775
Shaggy, you know Scooby
doesn't like clams.

01:47.942 --> 01:51.070
I like them. They're fun to dig
and even more fun to eat.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.281
Don't you wish Funland was open?

01:53.489 --> 01:57.952
The root-beer floats, the chocolate
custard, the rides. Man, that's living.

01:58.286 --> 02:00.955
Yes, but right now it looks
a little spooky...

02:01.122 --> 02:03.040
- even haunted.
- Haunted?

02:03.207 --> 02:06.127
Don't be silly, Daphne.

02:07.545 --> 02:09.797
Hey, look at that!

02:10.006 --> 02:15.303
But that's impossible.
That place won't be open for weeks.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.138
Look!

02:18.556 --> 02:21.892
Well, this calls for a
little investigation.

02:31.527 --> 02:32.987
It's hard to believe.

02:33.154 --> 02:36.490
Everything's running,
but nobody's here.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.076
Man, it's a dream come true.

02:39.243 --> 02:42.496
Let's check out that lunch
counter over there, Scooby.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.957
A little service, please?

02:45.333 --> 02:49.170
For openers, I'd like a malt and a hot dog
with all the trimmings.

02:49.337 --> 02:50.796
Me too.

02:51.339 --> 02:53.341
Who did that?

02:54.133 --> 02:56.427
Hey, I used to be pretty good at this.

02:56.594 --> 02:58.637
- Should I give it a whirl?
- Go ahead.

02:58.804 --> 03:02.350
- Who's to know?
- Okay. Batter up!

03:03.434 --> 03:04.935
Good throw, Freddy!

03:05.102 --> 03:08.981
Well, I've still got the old touch.
Let's go find Shaggy and Scooby.

03:09.148 --> 03:12.276
Gee, Freddy, shouldn't we stack
those bottles back up?

03:12.443 --> 03:13.694
You're right, Daphne.

03:13.861 --> 03:18.115
Look! The bottles are all stacked up
again! And what's that on the counter?

03:18.282 --> 03:20.493
It's a prize for knocking down
the bottles.

03:20.659 --> 03:22.703
Our backs were only turned for a minute.

03:23.037 --> 03:25.956
Oh, wow! Freddy, this is really weird.

03:26.123 --> 03:32.213
Well, somehow I got this prize,
so the least I can do is pay my 2 bits.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.840
What a cute kewpie doll.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.719
Oh, no!

03:39.095 --> 03:42.390
The cash register rang up 25 cents.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.393
I'm beginning to wonder
if this place is haunted.

03:48.229 --> 03:53.651
Scooby, do you think we stand a chance
of getting some cotton candy too?

03:54.693 --> 03:57.488
- Yeah!
- Hold it. I just saw somebody.

03:57.863 --> 04:01.575
There he goes again!
Man, he's faster than a speeding bullet.

04:04.245 --> 04:06.247
Superman!

04:18.592 --> 04:20.928
Come on, Scooby. Pick up the scent.

04:24.223 --> 04:27.768
- No scent.
- No scent? He has to have a scent.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.855
Why, he'd have to be a ghost
not to leave a scent.

04:31.689 --> 04:35.443
- Did I say "ghost"?
- Uh-huh. Oh-oh.

04:38.654 --> 04:40.906
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm pointing.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.700
You're pointing?

04:42.867 --> 04:46.245
Oh! I see him.

04:51.167 --> 04:52.793
That was no ghost.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.296
He looks more like a man from Mars.

04:59.467 --> 05:03.053
Wow! Look what that last hot dog
did to me!

05:04.763 --> 05:05.973
Look at me!

05:08.184 --> 05:10.144
I knew I was sharp...

05:10.978 --> 05:13.147
but this pointed head is too much.

05:15.441 --> 05:18.068
Whoa! A giant mouse!

05:18.235 --> 05:21.822
That's no giant mouse.
It's only a little mouse.

05:24.116 --> 05:29.246
Oh! Scooby-Doo, where are you?

05:32.333 --> 05:35.586
- Yow!
- Wow!

05:45.846 --> 05:48.015
There he is!

05:49.850 --> 05:52.186
What do you say?
Let's go find the others.

05:52.353 --> 05:54.688
Scooby-Doo! I'm with you!

05:56.690 --> 05:59.193
I don't see Scooby or Shaggy anywhere.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.987
There's someone going
along behind that fence.

06:02.488 --> 06:07.159
It's no one we know. But whoever it is,
I'd like to ask him a few questions.

06:10.037 --> 06:13.207
He's taking a ride on the Ferris wheel.

06:13.374 --> 06:16.627
It stopped.
That man is trapped up on top.

06:16.794 --> 06:19.547
I'll get him down.
I want to talk to him.

06:20.548 --> 06:25.302
I'll have to crank the wheel down
by hand. We can't leave him up there.

06:27.221 --> 06:30.307
You've turned it all
the way around, but he's gone.

06:30.474 --> 06:32.810
He couldn't have climbed down
without us seeing.

06:33.477 --> 06:36.981
Look! The lights are going off
all over the park!

06:41.360 --> 06:45.906
Well, this is the first time
I ever wanted to leave Funland.

06:50.953 --> 06:55.332
Scooby and I saw him.
Strictly a weirdo from outer space.

06:55.499 --> 06:59.587
- We saw him too.
- Look. I wonder whose house that is.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.839
It could be the caretaker.
Let's go see.

07:02.006 --> 07:04.758
We should tell him about
these mysterious happenings.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.761
I hope he's a nice, sweet old caretaker.

07:09.096 --> 07:12.433
And believe me, Mr. Jenkins,
all the rides were running.

07:12.600 --> 07:16.228
- I don't see how.
- Well, she was sure running wide-open.

07:16.395 --> 07:19.565
- Lights, music, everything.
- That's impossible.

07:19.732 --> 07:23.319
We're the caretakers here. My brother
and I would've seen the lights.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.947
- Sarah's right.
- Well, we saw a very strange character...

07:27.114 --> 07:29.908
- running around out there.
- He was, like, weirdo.

07:30.075 --> 07:32.202
- Weirdo-like.
- Fiddlesticks!

07:32.369 --> 07:35.164
Besides us, there's no one else
on this island.

07:35.331 --> 07:39.126
- Maybe the moonlight was playing tricks.
- But, <i>man,</i> I tell you-

07:39.293 --> 07:42.171
Let it go.
Sorry to have bothered you, sir.

07:42.338 --> 07:43.631
Let's go, gang.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.384
Well, how did you like that for
double talk?

07:47.551 --> 07:50.429
We can't go home now.
We know we didn't imagine...

07:50.596 --> 07:53.724
- all those kooky things that happened.
- Count me out.

07:53.891 --> 07:56.810
I'm not looking for any creep
with a frozen face.

07:57.061 --> 07:58.562
Uh-uh.

07:58.729 --> 08:02.107
Shaggy, sometimes I think you'd rather
eat pizza pie than solve a mystery.

08:02.274 --> 08:06.403
- Let's vote on it. Mystery or pizza pie?
- Pizza pie.

08:06.570 --> 08:10.032
Cut it out, you two.
Come on, let's get back to the beach.

08:11.950 --> 08:15.579
- Okay. We'll keep a watch from here.
- It's sure dark.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.165
What do they call this, a stakeout?

08:18.332 --> 08:22.503
I'd rather have a steak-in.
Like, a sirloin steak in me, that is.

08:22.753 --> 08:25.297
Me too. Yeah!

08:29.343 --> 08:34.306
- Oh, stop it! Stop it! I can't stand it!
- Be quiet, you two.

08:34.473 --> 08:37.643
We've been here an hour,
and no sign of life.

08:37.810 --> 08:40.145
We'll give it 10 minutes more. Oh-oh.

08:41.814 --> 08:44.733
Is that music I hear?

08:45.234 --> 08:48.821
- Look! The lights are going on!
- Here we go again!

08:49.154 --> 08:52.491
No doubt this time.
Let's get over there, quick!

08:54.326 --> 08:55.577
Something's haywire.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.746
What's wrong with the merry-go-round?

08:57.913 --> 08:59.873
It's running backwards.

09:00.791 --> 09:04.503
Look at that cotton-candy machine.
It's running wild!

09:04.670 --> 09:08.507
And the hot-dog stand. I can't stand it!

09:14.555 --> 09:15.973
Huh?

09:17.349 --> 09:19.727
- Hey.
- What's the matter, Scooby?

09:19.893 --> 09:21.478
I like to eat too, you know.

09:21.687 --> 09:24.648
Look! There's that strange guy again.

09:26.066 --> 09:29.486
- What a time for a sideshow.
- Come on, everybody. After him!

09:40.289 --> 09:41.957
Look what he's doing.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.503
What's wrong with him?

09:47.212 --> 09:50.174
Help! Shaggy, he's got me!

09:52.676 --> 09:55.971
Yow! Let go! Let go!

09:56.555 --> 09:59.141
He got me! He got me! Help!

09:59.308 --> 10:02.478
No, he didn't. There he goes now
into the Tunnel of Love.

10:02.644 --> 10:04.646
So we have to go into the tunnel
after him.

10:04.813 --> 10:07.149
I want to go, like, home.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.069
Row faster! We can catch him!

10:11.320 --> 10:14.323
There's something
in that tunnel! It's him!

10:14.823 --> 10:18.160
- He's swimming right at us!
- I thought we wanted to catch him.

10:19.495 --> 10:21.914
Like a torpedo, he's going to ram us!

10:23.665 --> 10:26.210
Don't panic! I'II save you!

10:26.543 --> 10:29.505
Thanks, Shaggy,
but why don't we just walk out.

10:29.671 --> 10:32.299
Oh, yeah. Good idea.

10:32.549 --> 10:36.011
That's no ordinary man.
He's going to be hard to track down.

10:36.178 --> 10:38.055
He'd better look out I don't catch him.

10:38.222 --> 10:41.517
I'll make him pay
for what he did to my hair.

10:42.643 --> 10:45.187
- Let's go back.
- We can't go back, Scooby.

10:45.354 --> 10:47.815
Freddy said to look on this side
of the park.

10:47.981 --> 10:52.861
It's okay just to look for the torpedo
man, as long as we don't find him.

10:53.028 --> 10:54.571
- What's that?
- Huh?

10:55.155 --> 10:58.283
Oh, that.
That's a real fun game, Scooby.

10:58.450 --> 11:00.911
Come on. I'll show you how it works.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.706
Now, you take this hammer,
and you hit that button.

11:04.873 --> 11:07.501
The ball goes up to the top
and rings the bell.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.837
Now watch the old master.

11:12.756 --> 11:14.216
Whoa!

11:16.927 --> 11:20.264
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

11:22.391 --> 11:24.309
Now I got it!

11:28.480 --> 11:30.232
- Hey, what you doing?
- My turn.

11:30.399 --> 11:33.402
Your turn? With your tail?

11:33.569 --> 11:35.737
Let me out of the way.

11:37.281 --> 11:38.699
Scooby-Doo!

11:46.748 --> 11:50.335
Hey, that was great! You gotta have
the strongest tail in the world.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.089
Oh-oh. It's him.

11:58.927 --> 12:01.054
He wins! Let's go, man!

12:12.649 --> 12:16.236
He's gaining on us!
Head for the roller coaster!

12:32.044 --> 12:36.048
He's climbing up the cars after us!
Let's go, Scooby!

12:38.967 --> 12:41.678
Here we go!

12:49.144 --> 12:51.438
Yow! We're trapped!

12:51.772 --> 12:55.943
Look! There's Shaggy and Scooby
in the front seat of that car!

12:59.196 --> 13:02.449
And that strange man is after them!

13:02.616 --> 13:05.077
There's an empty car
going up the other track.

13:05.243 --> 13:08.789
I'II slow it down,
and maybe they'll jump into it.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.540
Jump, Shaggy!

13:18.674 --> 13:22.177
- They made it!
- Scooby-Doo!

13:26.390 --> 13:28.100
Nice jump, you guys.

13:28.266 --> 13:32.354
Thanks, gang.
But don't ever let us do that again.

13:32.521 --> 13:35.816
I think that character's train
is coming in.

13:36.024 --> 13:38.151
Everybody hide behind those crates.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.030
But it's empty. How could he get out?

13:42.197 --> 13:44.032
Look! He's up there!

13:44.658 --> 13:46.660
What's he going to do?

13:46.827 --> 13:48.912
He's diving off!

13:52.165 --> 13:55.377
- Come on! He could be hurt!
- Let's go, Scooby!

13:59.297 --> 14:00.549
He's not here!

14:00.716 --> 14:04.553
- He crashed through the tent there.
- That's where he hit the crate.

14:04.720 --> 14:09.975
- It defies all the known laws of physics.
- I wish you could have seen his eyes.

14:10.142 --> 14:13.520
- Like two taillights on a hot rod.
- Yeah! Hot rod!

14:13.687 --> 14:16.440
Hot rod! That's it!

14:18.150 --> 14:20.777
The answer is, that this guy
can move so fast...

14:20.944 --> 14:23.113
we need something fast to catch him.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.741
We're gonna soup up
this electric car to catch him?

14:25.907 --> 14:29.036
Right. We'll increase the flow of power
from the battery.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.163
This might jazz it up.

14:31.329 --> 14:34.207
No, Shaggy!
You turned it on at the motor!

14:34.374 --> 14:37.085
Now Velma can't stop it!

14:37.919 --> 14:40.297
My glasses! I lost them!

14:43.383 --> 14:47.095
There's no brakes, Scooby,
and I can't see without my glasses.

14:47.262 --> 14:49.598
But it's a nice, wide street.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.812
Oh, don't fret, Scooby.

14:57.522 --> 15:01.902
- Hey, that's him!
- Oh, I see the traffic cop, silly.

15:02.110 --> 15:04.404
Right turn, isn't it?

15:08.784 --> 15:10.994
Go, Velma!

15:13.288 --> 15:16.291
Hey, Scooby,
are we in the right lane now?

15:16.458 --> 15:18.752
Right lane?

15:20.212 --> 15:21.546
Train coming!

15:21.713 --> 15:24.591
Train coming?
I told you I can't stop.

15:24.758 --> 15:28.053
The train will just have to
look out for itself.

15:36.770 --> 15:41.108
Here they come!
Look out for the cotton candy, Velma!

15:44.194 --> 15:48.615
- I think we've stalled.
- Wow, at least you're safe. What luck.

15:48.782 --> 15:53.703
What do you mean, luck? We didn't
have a bit of trouble. Ask Scooby.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.835
Scooby-Doo!

16:04.381 --> 16:08.635
- Well, that does it.
- But this guy is sure strong and fast.

16:08.802 --> 16:12.514
So we've had to build the prize trap
of all time to catch him.

16:12.681 --> 16:15.225
And this crate is it. Now here's the plan.

16:15.392 --> 16:17.853
Someone will lure the stranger
into this trap.

16:18.019 --> 16:21.273
But our man will be trapped in
the crate with that weirdo.

16:21.439 --> 16:25.527
No. Look up there. We'll pull our man
out of the trap in the basket.

16:25.694 --> 16:29.072
Shaggy'll lock the door,
and Velma and I will pull up the basket.

16:29.406 --> 16:34.161
And all Scooby has to do
is lure the stranger into the trap.

16:34.411 --> 16:36.121
Uh-uh.

16:36.288 --> 16:40.959
- Anybody got a Scooby Snack?
- No snacks. Not me.

16:41.209 --> 16:43.837
It's not fair. I'll go with Scooby.

16:44.004 --> 16:49.134
- We can use the dodgem car.
- No car! I'll go! I'll go!

18:03.416 --> 18:05.794
Set the trap! Set the trap!

18:06.795 --> 18:11.174
Set the trap! Get ready, everyone!
Here they come!

18:13.510 --> 18:15.845
We got him!

18:17.180 --> 18:21.559
- Scooby's safe!
- We got him trapped! We got him!

18:25.021 --> 18:27.023
What was that?

18:27.190 --> 18:32.070
Like, you won't believe it.
He went through the back of the trap...

18:32.696 --> 18:35.198
then through a wooden crate...

18:35.365 --> 18:38.535
and out the back through a brick wall!

18:39.369 --> 18:41.871
What a man! He's not human!

18:42.038 --> 18:44.207
You are absolutely right.

18:44.541 --> 18:46.876
He's not human. He's a robot.

18:47.085 --> 18:50.588
- It's Mr. Jenkins, the caretaker!
- What did you say, sir?

18:50.880 --> 18:54.217
He's Charlie,
the world's most perfect robot.

18:54.384 --> 18:57.637
I programmed him to operate
everything in Funland.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.557
- But why?
- I wanted to make enough robots...

19:00.724 --> 19:03.059
- to run the whole park.
- What happened?

19:03.226 --> 19:05.478
Your robot's been tearing up the place.

19:05.729 --> 19:07.856
Somehow he got out of control.

19:08.064 --> 19:10.358
But we can stop him
if you kids will help me.

19:10.692 --> 19:12.944
Here we go again.

19:15.697 --> 19:17.657
How does this equipment work?

19:17.824 --> 19:20.285
It's quite simple.
Once we find Charlie...

19:20.452 --> 19:24.748
the powerful electric magnet
will pull his metal body to it.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.958
Slow down.

19:27.584 --> 19:32.380
Charlie's close by. Look at that needle.
Turn on the big magnet.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.008
It's on.

19:35.717 --> 19:39.179
Aim it over at that shack.
I saw something move.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.977
Don't fight it, Charlie.

19:50.315 --> 19:52.192
What happened?

19:52.359 --> 19:54.611
This cable has been cut.

19:55.445 --> 19:58.198
- Charlie's crashed!
- I was afraid of that.

19:58.365 --> 20:01.451
The electromagnet
has fouled up his circuits.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.663
Hey, <i>Scooby's</i> up to something.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.249
Somebody's behind that fence.

20:11.169 --> 20:12.962
Come out of there!

20:14.464 --> 20:17.092
Sarah! What are you doing here?

20:17.258 --> 20:20.220
It was me that caused Charlie
to go out of control.

20:20.387 --> 20:24.391
I don't think robots should work
where children come to have fun.

20:24.557 --> 20:28.436
She's right. Charlie is nice,
but kids need humans.

20:28.645 --> 20:31.523
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
- I never thought about that.

20:31.815 --> 20:34.859
I just wanted a perfect robot.
But never mind.

20:35.026 --> 20:38.822
I'II rebuild him and call him
"Charlie the Second."

20:41.658 --> 20:45.829
Well, kids, Charlie's repaired,
and I think he's better than ever.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.372
That great, Mr. Jenkins.

20:47.664 --> 20:50.667
We came back today
to see if you had him fixed up.

20:52.001 --> 20:55.380
- Hey, where's Scooby?
- Well, would you look at that?

20:56.506 --> 20:58.967
He's getting his ears scratched.

20:59.843 --> 21:04.222
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

21:18.528 --> 21:19.612
Huh?

21:57.025 --> 21:58.026
Shh.
