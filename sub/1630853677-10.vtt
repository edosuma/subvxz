beverage of Alabama.

just slowly lowering your standards,

05:22.489 --> 05:23.949

what the hell you're doing wrong,

09:02.668 --> 09:04.753
- Can I see your pics?
- Yeah, go ahead. Take a look.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.588
They're not, like, professional.

09:06.588 --> 09:09.424
Why does everyone have professional pics?
Yeah.

09:09.967 --> 09:13.262
JESSIE:
Yeah... Can I make a suggestion?

09:13.262 --> 09:16.723
I just don't see these attracting
the right kind of guy.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.392
Oh.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.977
Uh...

09:19.977 --> 09:22.062
Okay, what was the suggestion?

09:22.062 --> 09:24.523
There we go. Elegant, in charge,

09:24.523 --> 09:26.149
professional. This is you.

09:26.149 --> 09:29.403
- Are you sure this is the look?
What do you guys think?

09:30.279 --> 09:32.614
- Gorge. Pure Louise.
- Yeah. Really nice. Fantastic.

09:32.614 --> 09:33.991
♪

09:33.991 --> 09:35.325
Okay!

09:35.325 --> 09:37.244
Smile for me.

09:38.787 --> 09:39.997
Think female governor.

09:39.997 --> 09:41.039
Okay.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.461
- I'd vote for that.
- Very nice, Louise.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.630
Incredible. Very smart.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.466
You can read my mind.
I know you can.

09:52.926 --> 09:53.969
Angel!

09:53.969 --> 09:55.470
Ooh, how's it going?

09:55.470 --> 09:56.930
This game is so hard.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.474
My visions really aren't helping me
figure out who the fake is.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.852
What about your new friend, Flonase?

10:01.852 --> 10:03.145
If you're making that joke,

10:03.145 --> 10:05.397
you obviously know her name is Allegra,

10:05.397 --> 10:08.108
and she is the real deal.
She reads auras.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.526
Are you sure about that?

10:09.526 --> 10:10.694
- Mm-hmm. Ooh!

10:10.694 --> 10:12.905
Ooh! Ooh! That's the woman
who ignored me at the bar.

10:12.905 --> 10:14.323
Maybe it's her.

10:14.323 --> 10:15.699
Ooh. Go, go, go, go, go.

10:17.701 --> 10:19.203
Oh, so sorry.

10:20.329 --> 10:23.665
- If you touch my shawl again,
I will kill you.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.133
Okay, she's very legit.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.428
- No way he's six-one.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.639
-See you, Jonathan.
-Hate that hat.

10:38.639 --> 10:39.640
See you, Taylor.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.391
JESSIE:
Oh, he needs a hat!

10:41.391 --> 10:42.351

Oh no.

Uh-oh.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.857
- Mm...
- Oh. Oh dear.

10:49.233 --> 10:51.443
- Oh, that obviously
wasn't supposed to happen.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.112
Would you like to explain?

10:54.112 --> 10:56.448
I mean, yeah. I'm not on here.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.742
I created a profile when we broke up.

10:58.742 --> 11:01.745
I went on this one horrible date
with this girl named Katharine,

11:01.745 --> 11:03.247
who's never tried ketchup.

11:03.247 --> 11:05.290
But, I deleted the app

11:05.290 --> 11:07.125
when we got back together,

11:07.125 --> 11:09.753
so I have no idea why this is on here.
Mm, yeah.

11:09.753 --> 11:11.588
You got to delete your account,

11:11.588 --> 11:13.465
not just the app.
That's how they got you,

11:13.465 --> 11:14.466
so...

11:15.759 --> 11:18.136
Ben, LA.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.305
"I'm just a guy
standing in front of a girl,

11:20.305 --> 11:23.684
asking her to DM him
her fave one-hit wonder."

11:23.684 --> 11:25.352
I think we can, like, swipe left...

11:25.352 --> 11:28.647
- "Teachin', beachin', and tearing
it up in the keetchen."

11:29.690 --> 11:31.942
I've never felt more naked in my life.

11:31.942 --> 11:33.193
I'm gonna grab another drink.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.362
- From the keetchen?

11:35.362 --> 11:37.322
LOUISE:
You know, in his defense,

11:37.322 --> 11:39.783
rhyming's really big on here.
At least it's not as bad as

11:39.783 --> 11:41.743
"fluent in sarcasm."

11:41.743 --> 11:43.203
Oh. Okay, guys. Shh.

11:43.203 --> 11:46.248
Couples therapy later.
We have got a match.

11:46.248 --> 11:47.624
It's Nate!

11:47.624 --> 11:49.126
The CEO?

11:49.126 --> 11:51.587
- Oh my god! This is such a rush.
We have to message him.

11:51.587 --> 11:53.130
"Uh, hi.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.006
LOL."

11:54.006 --> 11:56.925
"I'm an entrepreneur

11:56.925 --> 11:58.552
in the wellness space."

11:58.552 --> 12:01.013
Yeah, I'm just a yoga instructor.

12:01.013 --> 12:03.432
- I'm not trying to scam people.
- I'm just making sure you pop.

12:03.432 --> 12:04.808
This guy is, like, my ideal man.

12:04.808 --> 12:06.435
- Really?

12:08.854 --> 12:10.397
For Louise.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.567
- Really?
- Yep.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.368
Better not be you.

12:23.368 --> 12:24.661
Is it?

12:24.661 --> 12:27.456
- Excuse you.
I am a full-time psychic.

12:27.456 --> 12:29.708
- How do I know you're not the actor?
- I wish.

12:29.708 --> 12:32.711
Not being a psychic
would make my life a lot easier.

12:33.712 --> 12:36.632
I saw my parents' divorce
eight years before it happened.

12:36.632 --> 12:38.467
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:38.467 --> 12:41.094
That must have been really hard.

12:41.470 --> 12:44.097
- Hey, I am James.
I'm 34 years old,

12:44.097 --> 12:47.643

of Sexy Zombie Number Three.

12:47.643 --> 12:49.228

12:49.228 --> 12:50.729
You are the actor!

12:50.729 --> 12:52.856
- Yes!
- Oh, come on.

12:52.856 --> 12:54.775
If I get found out, I don't get paid.

12:54.775 --> 12:55.609
Oh.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.110

Yeah, <i>she</i> is the actor.

13:01.532 --> 13:02.908

13:02.908 --> 13:05.160

- No.

13:13.502 --> 13:15.295
I could tell she was
forcing it all night.
