WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:13.096
Follow yourselfTo the top of a mountain

00:13.180 --> 00:15.682
Answer the callYeah, be the believer

00:15.766 --> 00:18.852
Throw your fears like a wishInto a fountain

00:19.436 --> 00:22.898
Like a warrior

00:22.981 --> 00:25.192
Whatever you might beWhoever you are

00:25.275 --> 00:28.445
You're a warrior

00:31.156 --> 00:33.116
"This calls for courage."

00:36.411 --> 00:40.582
So, you ready for your firstsolo mission into the woods?

00:40.666 --> 00:41.667
Yep.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.669
-You sure?-Yep.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.796
You really sure?

00:45.879 --> 00:46.880
Dad.

00:46.964 --> 00:48.215
Sorry.

00:48.298 --> 00:51.760
It's just that a warrior'sfirst mission alone is a big deal.

00:51.844 --> 00:55.639
But we're just gatheringsome wild veggies for our picnic.

00:56.223 --> 00:59.142
I know. And I know you're ready for it,

00:59.226 --> 01:02.479
which is why I am bequeathing unto you which is why I am bequeathing unto you

01:02.563 --> 01:06.191
an object no independent warriorshould ever be without.

01:07.985 --> 01:10.654
The Help-Me Horn.

01:14.908 --> 01:18.453
Why would I need that?This is a solo mission.

01:18.537 --> 01:19.997
Right, Pony?

01:20.080 --> 01:22.666
Sure, but you may need helpcarrying things back,

01:22.749 --> 01:24.543
or you might get lost.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.879
Or you could even run into a "where-wolf."

01:26.962 --> 01:28.839
They have no sense of direction, huh?

01:30.382 --> 01:33.427
No matter the reason, blow the horn,and I'll come find you.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.305
Okay. Does this mean we can go now?

01:36.388 --> 01:38.098
Yep. Good luck.

01:38.182 --> 01:41.310
And wish me luck too.I have to collect cockatrice eggs

01:41.393 --> 01:43.812
for our salad in the middleof nesting season, so…

01:44.479 --> 01:46.773
We're not gonna need this old horn, Pony,

01:46.857 --> 01:50.194
'cause I packed some warrior toolsfor any eventuality.

01:50.277 --> 01:54.156
Like this peashooter,in case we get attacked.

01:55.490 --> 01:59.369
And this spork, in case we comeacross a thick stew that needs eating.

02:00.871 --> 02:03.165
Anything can happen in the forest.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.501
I even packed some bread crumbs,

02:05.584 --> 02:08.419
so we can leave a trail behind usto find our way back.

02:09.670 --> 02:10.797
That's right.

02:10.881 --> 02:17.054
We're a couple of independent warriorswhose only direction is adventure!

02:19.681 --> 02:21.934
Right. The veggies are that way.

02:22.601 --> 02:23.810
Adventure!

02:34.446 --> 02:35.781
All right.

02:38.784 --> 02:39.952
Okay, bud.

02:41.912 --> 02:42.955
Adventure!

02:43.956 --> 02:45.082
Pony.

02:52.381 --> 02:55.926
We haven't founda single wild veggie, Pony.

02:56.009 --> 02:59.012
There's just a bunchof empty holes around here.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.265
Maybe we should follow the crumbs back. Maybe we should follow the crumbs back.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.353
I get it.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.689
Who wouldn't lovea little sweet crumb action?

03:10.107 --> 03:12.359
I could really use a snack too.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.735
Sorry, pal,

03:13.819 --> 03:17.489
but I don't think there's anything elseto eat in here.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.993
The horn? We don't need help, Pony.

03:21.076 --> 03:23.495
I can do this on my own.

03:23.579 --> 03:25.205
We've just gotta go that way.

03:26.957 --> 03:29.001
Or wait. Was it that way?

03:29.835 --> 03:31.044
A carrot!

03:32.462 --> 03:35.007
Look, Pony. We finally found a veggie.

03:48.270 --> 03:51.023
At least we found a carrot!

03:51.106 --> 03:53.483
How are you, Pony? Does anything hurt?

03:55.986 --> 03:58.780
Okay. So we're in a hole.

03:58.864 --> 04:00.199
No big deal. No big deal.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.663
Troll!

04:08.582 --> 04:10.042
Get behind me, Pony.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.005
Not now, Pony. I've got this.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.632
Step back, troll.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.051
I must warn you I have a--

04:19.134 --> 04:21.970
Hold up. That's not my peashooter.

04:22.971 --> 04:25.432
Hey! Listen, troll--

04:25.516 --> 04:27.601
The name's Lyken.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.811
Thank you so much for breaking in.

04:32.356 --> 04:35.859
I haven't caught any trespassers before.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.904
Now, what am I gonna do with you?

04:39.905 --> 04:41.406
Let us go?

04:41.490 --> 04:44.201
My super-tough warrior party is up top.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.954
And if we don't show up,they'll come looking for us.

04:47.037 --> 04:51.708
So you're sayingI should expect more of you to join?

04:52.876 --> 04:55.379
Well, not if we're intruding.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.713
We shouldn't overstay.

04:56.797 --> 05:00.342
No. No, no. No. Please overstay. No. No, no. No. Please overstay.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.677
The more, the merrier.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.973
I don't know about you,but I'm feeling rather peckish.

05:07.891 --> 05:11.687
While I get things ready,you can wait in the happy corner.

05:18.068 --> 05:21.530
I should start with appetizers.Tapas style.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.993
No, Lyken, no. Don't be such a foodie.

05:26.076 --> 05:30.998
Skip right to the main course.Or, better yet, dessert.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.585
Okay, pal. We're trapped.

05:34.668 --> 05:39.089
But maybe we can use something in hereto help me reach my bag of tools.

05:39.173 --> 05:42.342
This mud wall feels like the onewe climb in the training yard.

05:43.302 --> 05:45.012
I bet I could scale it, Pony.

05:45.095 --> 05:48.056
Now, where'd I put that mallet?

05:48.140 --> 05:50.475
Okay, Pony. I need youto create a diversion

05:50.559 --> 05:52.186
while I climb up the shelves.

05:52.269 --> 05:55.731
Once I get to the top, I'll grab the bagand use it to get us out of here.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.277
This could use more cardamom. This could use more cardamom.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.613
I love an occasionthat calls for cardamom.

06:04.740 --> 06:07.618
How did you get out of the happy corner?

06:07.701 --> 06:11.872
Let's just put you backuntil the oven's ready.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.255
Dinner theater? Yes, please.

06:20.339 --> 06:22.758
Look at all these wild veggies.

06:22.841 --> 06:25.969
He must use them for making intruder stew.

06:26.053 --> 06:29.264
Well, he's not gettingmy spork for eating it.

06:29.348 --> 06:33.101
That was a five-star performance.

06:33.185 --> 06:37.606
But now, time for a five-star meal!

06:37.689 --> 06:41.026
No! I won't let Pony become troll food.

06:41.109 --> 06:46.198
The Help-Me Horn.I just need…

06:49.618 --> 06:52.621
To reach it. Got it!

06:56.917 --> 07:01.296
Help! Help! Somebody help! Help! Help! Somebody help!

07:02.047 --> 07:03.924
Are you okay?

07:04.007 --> 07:05.592
What do you care?

07:05.676 --> 07:08.095
You're just gonna eat meand my pal anyway.

07:08.679 --> 07:11.265
Eat you? But I'm a lacto-vegetarian.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.892
Yeah, right.

07:13.976 --> 07:17.354
Then where is Pony?Have you put him in the pot already?

07:20.858 --> 07:22.025
Pony?

07:22.943 --> 07:26.029
I'm sorry.I gave you the wrong impression.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.866
I thought we could sit down and havesome tea and snacks.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.993
Maybe play a game while we waitedfor your friends.

07:31.577 --> 07:34.454
I've got Ravenous Rhinos,Don't Wake Craggy,

07:34.538 --> 07:36.248
and my favorite, No Clue!

07:37.040 --> 07:38.959
I'm still not sureon the rules for that one.

07:39.042 --> 07:40.544
Never heard of any of them.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.671
That's because I made them myself!

07:42.754 --> 07:44.590
But it's hard to gauge interest

07:44.673 --> 07:47.801
when your test-marketis just your mud buddies.

07:47.885 --> 07:50.721
They don't give a lotof constructive feedback.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.014
Carrot and cardamom cookie?

07:56.310 --> 07:57.311
Okay.

07:57.394 --> 08:00.647
If you weren't gonna eat us,why did you put us in that cage? If you weren't gonna eat us,why did you put us in that cage?

08:00.731 --> 08:02.065
Oh, my.

08:02.149 --> 08:05.903
The happy corner is not a cage.

08:05.986 --> 08:10.532
It's where I rehabilitate animalsthat have accidentally fallen down here

08:10.616 --> 08:12.284
before I set them free.

08:12.367 --> 08:15.913
I thought you'd like to play with my toyswhile you waited.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.956
They're pretty cool, right?

08:20.125 --> 08:22.544
This is your home.

08:23.879 --> 08:26.757
You know, for a troll,you're not very mean.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.927
I thought you'd at leastask us a riddle or something.

08:30.010 --> 08:34.847
I'm not really into riddles as muchas I enjoy a good crossword.

08:36.058 --> 08:37.976
I miss getting the daily paper.

08:38.059 --> 08:40.854
If you're so lonely,why do you stay down here?

08:40.938 --> 08:44.149
I'm too embarrassed to leave.

08:44.733 --> 08:48.153
I was rehoming treesfrom my woodland with some friends

08:48.237 --> 08:52.699
when I left to find a bigger treeto impress them with.

08:52.783 --> 08:58.038
But when I tried to lift iton my own, I fell down here.

08:58.121 --> 09:01.083
I was worried if I askedthe other trolls for help, I was worried if I askedthe other trolls for help,

09:01.166 --> 09:04.044
they'd think I couldn'tdo anything without them.

09:04.127 --> 09:08.090
I wanted them to thinkthat I was strong as oak.

09:08.173 --> 09:12.553
But being down heremakes me feel like sap.

09:12.636 --> 09:16.682
-How long have you been down here?-The beginning of the season.

09:16.765 --> 09:18.934
I'm sure my friends have long gone.

09:19.017 --> 09:22.312
Lyken, there's no one lookingfor us either.

09:22.396 --> 09:27.401
I got lost and didn't wantto use the Help-Me Horn my dad gave me.

09:27.484 --> 09:30.153
I wanted him to thinkI could do this by myself.

09:30.237 --> 09:33.407
But I wish I had used itto call him when I had the chance.

09:35.284 --> 09:39.037
I wish I had called for my friendswhen I had the chance too.

09:40.205 --> 09:43.292
But maybe I can call your dadfor you instead!

09:43.375 --> 09:47.004
A troll's bellow can echo for miles.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.839
If my dad hears it,

09:48.922 --> 09:51.425
he'll come running,and he could help you too.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.594
I'd appreciate that.

09:53.677 --> 09:56.471
I think it's time to step out of my shame.

09:56.555 --> 09:59.641
Not to mention, I could usemore stimulating company.

09:59.725 --> 10:01.894
No offense, Darrel. No offense, Darrel.

10:02.477 --> 10:03.729
Here goes nothing.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.738
Hey, that's Lyken's call.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.740
It came from over there.

10:14.823 --> 10:17.201
No, it's here.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.119
Hey, I think I found a hole.

10:19.203 --> 10:21.830
So that's where you've been!

10:22.581 --> 10:25.584
Oh, we have been looking all over for you.

10:26.376 --> 10:29.713
My friends.They didn't leave me after all.

10:31.924 --> 10:34.426
Bye, Lyken. Thanks for your help.

10:38.013 --> 10:40.265
-Hey! You're okay.-Dad.

10:40.891 --> 10:43.560
What's up? Why did the hornsound like a troll bellow?

10:43.644 --> 10:49.233
I'm sorry. I got us lost in the woods,and I didn't wanna ask for help.

10:49.316 --> 10:52.402
I wanted to show youI could be an independent warrior.

10:52.486 --> 10:56.490
Oh, Pinecone.I know your independence is important.

10:56.573 --> 10:59.535
But you can be independentwithout having to be alone.

10:59.618 --> 11:01.870
Even I ask for help when I need it. See? Even I ask for help when I need it. See?

11:03.372 --> 11:05.541
Now that's a horn.

11:05.624 --> 11:09.753
Oh, yeah.And I kinda used it to call for backup.

11:12.506 --> 11:15.342
-Mom.-Oh, you're all safe. Awesome.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.555
So, should we all go have some salad?

11:19.638 --> 11:22.724
Yeah, Lyken gave me plenty of veggies.

11:22.808 --> 11:23.976
And cookies too.

11:24.852 --> 11:25.894
Cool.

11:26.979 --> 11:28.272
Who's Lyken?

11:33.068 --> 11:35.112
"The straight and arrow."

11:39.741 --> 11:41.201
Hot pie.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.829
Hot pie alert!

11:45.581 --> 11:46.582
Marvelous.

11:49.626 --> 11:53.130
Are those olives?Banana peppers? Pineapples?

11:53.213 --> 11:55.132
Yep, yep, and yep.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.300
Okay, good.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.178
'Cause those are Prince Randolf'sfavorite pizza toppings.

11:59.261 --> 12:01.221
It's all here in Archery Monthly. It's all here in Archery Monthly.

12:01.305 --> 12:04.474
Mom, did you knowPrince Randolf can hit a lima bean

12:04.558 --> 12:07.102
with an arrow from 50 paces back?

12:07.186 --> 12:11.690
And his favorite color is autumn breeze?I mean, what is that even?

12:11.773 --> 12:13.400
Okay.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.028
Someone's excitedto meet the prince today.

12:16.111 --> 12:19.114
He's the best archerin the Greater Kingdom area.

12:19.198 --> 12:22.701
He won the Golden Archer Tournamentwhen he was only ten.

12:22.784 --> 12:25.120
The youngest winner ever!

12:25.204 --> 12:28.832
Until you. You're only eight,and you won it this year.

12:28.916 --> 12:32.711
Yeah. I mean, kinda.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.213
Kinda?

12:34.296 --> 12:38.383
Isn't that your freshly polished trophysitting in the middle of the table?

12:39.676 --> 12:43.639
I thought it wouldmake a good centerpiece.

12:45.807 --> 12:49.394
Okay. I wanted to show it to the prince.

12:50.062 --> 12:51.480
I hope he likes me.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.862
I have got to get a real trumpet.

12:58.946 --> 13:02.783
May I present our esteemed party guests, May I present our esteemed party guests,

13:02.866 --> 13:06.912
King Yew and Queen Biancaof Fletchers' Vale,

13:06.995 --> 13:12.084
accompanied by their son, Prince Randolf!

13:16.755 --> 13:19.633
His falcon's name is Rudy.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.593
Fun fact.

13:21.677 --> 13:25.430
Oh, we're so glad you could make it.Hope you brought your appetites.

13:25.514 --> 13:27.266
You know it.

13:29.476 --> 13:35.899
Your Royal Majesty, it is I,Princess Pinecone of Sturdystone,

13:35.983 --> 13:39.278
and my royal steed, Pony.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.117
I'm a really, really, really big fan.

13:45.200 --> 13:49.079
I wanted to be a great archerjust like you. So I practiced real hard,

13:49.162 --> 13:52.499
and I won the Golden Archer trophyjust like you did. Look.

13:53.125 --> 13:56.086
Cool. I'm going over there now.

13:57.004 --> 14:01.633
Wow, Prince Randolf's mean.Well-dressed but mean. Wow, Prince Randolf's mean.Well-dressed but mean.

14:01.717 --> 14:04.928
Maybe Randolf's just shy around his fans?

14:05.012 --> 14:07.431
I'm sure he'll warm uponce he gets to know me.

14:07.514 --> 14:10.809
Come on, pal. Let's go show the princeI'm the new friend

14:10.893 --> 14:12.769
he never knew he needed to know.

14:14.146 --> 14:16.356
May I get you a napkin, Prince Randolf?

14:24.615 --> 14:28.869
What is with this thing?I want more orange drink!

14:28.952 --> 14:30.996
Allow me to help you with that.

14:34.166 --> 14:37.461
Oops. Thought it would go in the cup.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.596
Never fear. I shall get it.

14:47.679 --> 14:49.890
-Wait, Pinecone.-Don't.

14:53.685 --> 14:55.187
Yeah, that was a pretty bad idea.

14:58.023 --> 14:59.399
What is your problem?

15:00.442 --> 15:01.944
My problem?

15:02.027 --> 15:05.906
I just wanted to talk to you,but you've been ignoring me all day.

15:05.989 --> 15:08.742
I thought since we're archers,we could be friends.

15:09.535 --> 15:11.703
I'm the best archerin all the land.

15:11.787 --> 15:14.414
You're just some kid with a bow.

15:14.498 --> 15:16.792
I won the same tournament you did.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.627
Must have been a slow year.

15:22.256 --> 15:24.800
If you think you'reso much better than me,

15:24.883 --> 15:27.094
maybe we shouldlet our bows do the talking.

15:27.177 --> 15:31.598
Sounds good to me.I challenge you to an archer's duel.

15:31.682 --> 15:32.891
If you win--

15:32.975 --> 15:37.729
You have to apologizefor being such a big meanie face!

15:38.522 --> 15:42.609
If I win,I get to keep your trophy.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.571
Don't do it, Pinecone.

15:45.654 --> 15:49.366
You're a great archer.You don't need to prove anything to him.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.953
Do it! Do it! Do it!

15:56.915 --> 16:00.711
Training yard. Right now. Training yard. Right now.

16:01.879 --> 16:02.713
Hey, bud.

16:02.796 --> 16:06.425
-Where are you kids going?-To battle for our honor.

16:07.259 --> 16:09.136
Cool. Just be back for dessert.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.847
The rules of an archer's duel are simple.

16:11.930 --> 16:15.434
The first archerto get five bull's-eyes wins.

16:15.517 --> 16:18.145
Works for me. You can go first.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.272
If you say so.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.235
Noice!

16:26.236 --> 16:29.323
No big deal. I can do that too.

16:34.578 --> 16:37.873
Hey! You distracted me on purpose.

16:38.457 --> 16:41.585
I don't control what Rudy does.Falcons gonna caw.

16:43.837 --> 16:46.548
That's one point for me.

16:47.257 --> 16:51.720
He cheated. He distracted me on purpose.

16:51.803 --> 16:54.848
Sorry, there's nothing in myBig Book of Ancient Games

16:54.932 --> 16:56.225
about interference by falcon.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.145
And she was all like, And she was all like,

17:00.229 --> 17:02.314
"Ooh. Ooh, falcon. Oh, no."

17:03.815 --> 17:05.651
I can't let him have my trophy.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.486
I worked too hard for it.

17:09.154 --> 17:12.199
-What trophy are we talking about?-My Golden Archer.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.201
The best trophy I've ever won.

17:14.284 --> 17:17.496
Hey! What about the one I made you?

17:17.579 --> 17:19.790
The World's Coolest Pinecone Award?

17:19.873 --> 17:22.209
It was a pine cone you painted gold.

17:22.291 --> 17:25.420
Yeah, but you can't beat that title.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.675
Juice break's over.

17:29.758 --> 17:32.261
Time to get back to our duel.

17:40.143 --> 17:42.563
I'm all right, pal. You go on without me.

17:42.646 --> 17:44.022
I'll catch up in a sec.

17:45.774 --> 17:47.025
Heads up!

17:47.109 --> 17:48.277
I mean, down!

17:53.240 --> 17:54.283
Juice.

17:54.366 --> 17:57.286
Heavenly nectar in a box.

17:57.369 --> 17:59.997
Greymoon, I didn't knowyou were such a good archer.

18:00.622 --> 18:02.374
I'm such a good wizard.

18:02.457 --> 18:05.669
I enchanted these arrowsto entertain our guests.

18:06.670 --> 18:09.840
They were impressed, of course.I have that effect on people.

18:09.923 --> 18:12.134
So these arrows are magic?

18:12.217 --> 18:15.179
They never miss their aim.

18:15.262 --> 18:19.433
And speaking of which, my aim isto get more pizza. Excuse me.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.686
They never miss.

18:22.769 --> 18:26.815
Hey, Pinenut!What's the holdup? I want my trophy.

18:26.899 --> 18:28.400
That cheater face!

18:28.483 --> 18:32.487
If he's not gonna play fair,I'm not gonna play fair either.

18:34.364 --> 18:36.074
Ready for round two?

18:37.576 --> 18:38.869
I am now.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.830
Round two is blindfolded.Not that it'll stop me.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.086
Very close.

18:48.170 --> 18:51.048
But I doubt you could do better.That shot is--

18:52.341 --> 18:53.383
Impossible?

18:55.010 --> 18:56.303
Not for me, I guess.

18:56.386 --> 18:59.473
-Yay, Pinecone!-Amazing shot!

18:59.556 --> 19:02.476
So we're tied one all, big deal. So we're tied one all, big deal.

19:02.559 --> 19:04.937
You still needfour more bull's-eyes to win.

19:05.020 --> 19:07.606
I don't think that'll be a problem.

19:58.407 --> 20:02.035
Yeah! One more point, and Pinecone wins! Yeah! One more point, and Pinecone wins!

20:02.119 --> 20:03.745
-Pinecone!-Yay, Pinecone!

20:03.829 --> 20:05.038
Yes!

20:05.664 --> 20:06.665
Yeah!

20:10.586 --> 20:11.420
Hey, pal.

20:11.503 --> 20:15.090
Aren't you gonna come watch metake down Prince Meanie Face?

20:15.674 --> 20:17.885
Man, I have got to come upwith a better burn.

20:20.220 --> 20:23.473
My arrows? What are you--

20:26.101 --> 20:27.686
You saw that, huh?

20:31.190 --> 20:32.983
I know it's not right to cheat.

20:33.066 --> 20:36.111
But I can't let Prince Randolf walk awaywith my special trophy.

20:36.695 --> 20:38.488
You understand, right, pal?

20:39.656 --> 20:40.866
I guess not.

20:46.955 --> 20:50.918
For this challenge,the target is now 50 paces back.

20:52.711 --> 20:56.131
Randolf can hit a lima beanfrom 50 paces back.

20:56.798 --> 20:59.426
-How did you know that?-Just a guess.

20:59.927 --> 21:02.387
Whatever. Let's just get this over with. Whatever. Let's just get this over with.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.059
Bull's-eye.

21:07.142 --> 21:09.269
Score is now tied at four-all.

21:09.353 --> 21:13.690
Pinecone, if you make this shot,you'll win the duel and this trophy,

21:13.774 --> 21:16.527
which is technically yours already.But you get to keep it.

21:19.947 --> 21:24.117
Pinecone! Pinecone! Pinecone!Pinecone! Pinecone! Pine--

21:25.410 --> 21:27.829
The World's Coolest Pinecone Award.

21:29.206 --> 21:31.625
"World's Coolest Pinecone."

21:32.709 --> 21:34.419
I don't deserve to win.

21:34.503 --> 21:36.672
I used Greymoon's magic arrows to cheat.

21:38.924 --> 21:39.925
No way.

21:41.301 --> 21:42.302
Yeah!

21:42.386 --> 21:44.513
I knew you couldn'tbe better than me.

21:45.931 --> 21:50.435
I earned that trophy with hard workbecause I wanted to be like you.

21:51.228 --> 21:54.940
But now that I met you,I don't wanna be like you at all.

21:55.023 --> 22:00.612
I wanna be a great archer,but I'd rather be the coolest Pinecone. I wanna be a great archer,but I'd rather be the coolest Pinecone.

22:01.864 --> 22:04.199
Whatever. Just give me my trophy.

22:07.828 --> 22:10.998
Randolf, what are you doingwith Pinecone's trophy?

22:11.081 --> 22:12.457
I won it.

22:12.541 --> 22:15.294
Oh, no, you didn't.Give it back right now.

22:15.377 --> 22:16.795
But, Dad…

22:16.879 --> 22:18.338
Now.

22:21.633 --> 22:25.012
So, who wants cake?

22:25.095 --> 22:26.388
-Yes!-I do!

22:27.848 --> 22:28.849
Thanks, pal.

22:28.932 --> 22:31.226
And I want you to have this one.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.274
You and I

22:37.357 --> 22:40.027
Adventurers brave and free

22:40.903 --> 22:45.157
Side by sideTogether we'll always be

22:45.240 --> 22:49.745
Thick as thieves

22:50.787 --> 22:55.209
Thick as thieves
