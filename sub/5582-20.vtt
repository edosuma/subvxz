WEBVTT

00:06.074 --> 00:11.545
(Dixieland band playing "When
the Saints Go Marching In")

00:56.557 --> 00:59.093
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

00:59.127 --> 01:01.762
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:01.795 --> 01:04.265
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:04.298 --> 01:05.599
* How, how, how, how

01:05.633 --> 01:08.169
* Hey, hey

01:13.474 --> 01:15.143
* You gotta come on.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.881
Wait, wait, wait, wait, you
never walked one of these?

01:20.914 --> 01:23.117
How long you live here?

01:23.151 --> 01:25.219
Long enough to know
it's not for me.

01:25.253 --> 01:28.122
Look, now don't get me wrong,
I enjoy a good party,

01:28.156 --> 01:29.123
just not when someone dies.

01:29.157 --> 01:31.125
That is not the point.

01:31.159 --> 01:32.893
Second Lines
celebrate living.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.296
It's a cultural tradition.
Hell, I grew up with 'em.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.465
Taught me to
appreciate life.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.900
Yeah, well, where I grew up,
you live, you die,

01:39.933 --> 01:41.135
you get married.

01:41.169 --> 01:42.636
No fuss, no muss.
And besides,

01:42.670 --> 01:44.705
I appreciate life
just fine, thank you.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.640
Oh, sure you do.
You live, you party,

01:46.674 --> 01:48.209
meet some girl,
party some more.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.443
No fuss, no muss.

01:49.477 --> 01:50.744
Something like that.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.781
According to his I.D.,

01:53.814 --> 01:55.916
victim is Lieutenant
Darren Murray, 31.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.885
Checked with Belle Chase,

01:57.918 --> 02:00.221
says he was a clinical
psychologist at base.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.856
And a Casualty Assistance
Calls Officer.

02:02.890 --> 02:05.159
CACO.
Was the funeral for a sailor?

02:05.193 --> 02:07.161
James Boyd, Reservist.

02:07.195 --> 02:09.263
Who was on active duty
when he died,

02:09.297 --> 02:11.465
so it's possible Lieutenant
Murray was assisting the family.

02:11.499 --> 02:13.534
It could explain why
he was here, at least.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.303
Yeah, but why wasn't he
in his dress whites?

02:15.336 --> 02:17.405
And why is he
in an alley?

02:17.438 --> 02:18.572
Taking pictures, apparently.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.341
The only problem is...

02:20.374 --> 02:23.344
memory card is missing,
and I couldn't find

02:23.377 --> 02:25.713
any fingerprints
on the camera.
Yeah, naturally.

02:25.746 --> 02:28.349
Sebastian should be able to find
the most recent pictures.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.318
Most cameras have
an internal memory, too.

02:30.351 --> 02:32.586
Yeah, it'd go a long way in
helping us figure out

02:32.620 --> 02:35.223
what Lieutenant Murray was doing
here, if he wasn't here

02:35.256 --> 02:36.490
for Boyd's family.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.292
That doesn't make sense.

02:38.326 --> 02:40.428
If Lieutenant Murray was CACO,

02:40.461 --> 02:41.929
why hide in an alley,

02:41.962 --> 02:44.265
taking photos
of the Second Line,

02:44.298 --> 02:45.766
instead of being
a part of it?

02:45.799 --> 02:46.967
And why kill him?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.203
As soon as I get the body
back to the morgue,

02:49.237 --> 02:50.771
I'll know better how
he was strangled.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.740
And I should be able to
give you the height and weight

02:52.773 --> 02:54.308
of the killer too.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.544
Garroting takes considerable
size and strength.

02:56.577 --> 02:57.578
WOMAN: Oh, my God.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.313
Oh, my God.

02:59.347 --> 03:00.681
Lieutenant Murray?

03:00.714 --> 03:01.749
It's Lieutenant Murray.
MAN: Come on, Amelia.

03:01.782 --> 03:02.883
Come on, Amelia, let's go.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.117
Oh, it's Lieutenant Murray.
You're going through enough.

03:04.151 --> 03:07.355
PRIDE: Come on, sit down over
here with me, would you?

03:07.388 --> 03:08.756
AMELIA:
I heard something bad happened

03:08.789 --> 03:10.491
when we finished the Line.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.826
Had to see.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.529
The lieutenant was
such a nice man.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.498
He was so good to us.
How could this happen?

03:17.531 --> 03:19.667
I don't know,
but we'll find out.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.370
You're Amelia, right

03:22.403 --> 03:25.606
Do we know... ?

03:25.639 --> 03:28.509
I knew your Daddy.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.511
We worked at the sheriff
department together.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.012
A good man.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.447
Thank you.

03:33.481 --> 03:35.716
So Lieutenant Murray
was your CACO.

03:37.418 --> 03:40.388
First one to tell me
James was in a car crash,

03:40.421 --> 03:43.324
that he was gone.

03:43.357 --> 03:47.528
Just when he was starting
to turn his life around, too.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.330
Why he enlisted.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.732
Navy takes care of its own.

03:53.567 --> 03:57.405
Did you know that the
lieutenant was gonna be here?

03:57.438 --> 04:00.007
:
No.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.742
In fact, he said
he wouldn't be.

04:01.775 --> 04:04.778
Said it was all part of
how we start to move on.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.781
How could anybody
want to hurt him?

04:15.689 --> 04:18.058
How is she?

04:18.091 --> 04:20.661
She wants to know
what happened. So do I.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.963
Brody, you're with me.
Christopher, Sonja,

04:22.996 --> 04:24.298
go to Lieutenant Murray's house.

04:24.332 --> 04:25.999
Learn things.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.436
Killing a man
at another man's funeral.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.471
Doesn't get much
worse than that.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.750
Here too soon, Loretta?

04:42.783 --> 04:44.084
Well, I haven't completed

04:44.117 --> 04:45.619
the autopsy
on Lieutenant Murray,

04:45.653 --> 04:47.321
but I have identified
what cost him his life.

04:47.355 --> 04:48.622
Wasn't he strangled?

04:48.656 --> 04:50.358
Ah, but how?

04:50.391 --> 04:53.461
Answering that may help you
answer the bigger question.

04:53.494 --> 04:54.862
Who killed him.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.965
The lieutenant's
cricoid cartilage.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.401
Rings the trachea,
protects the voice box.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.603
Except these have
tiny grooves on them.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.405
Friction marks.

05:04.438 --> 05:05.673
Murder weapon.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.708
Or at least the mark
left by it.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.477
I'll send it to
Sebastian to analyze,

05:09.510 --> 05:11.379
see if he can come up
with some possibilities.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.013
Anything else?

05:13.046 --> 05:15.349
Not yet, uh, other than
you're looking

05:15.383 --> 05:18.852
for a relatively large man,
based on the severe angle

05:18.886 --> 05:21.355
of the garroting.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.457
Six-three, 230 pounds
or more, I'd guess,

05:23.491 --> 05:25.493
based on
the upward force.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.894
PRIDE: Yeah, might have
to look at those

05:26.927 --> 05:28.729
Second Line surveillance
cameras after all.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.464
See how many folks
fit the description.

05:30.498 --> 05:31.932
I don't do
Second Lines.

05:33.534 --> 05:34.968
I mean, other than
David Bowie's of course,

05:35.002 --> 05:36.870
but then again, every
hipster in town did that.

05:36.904 --> 05:38.972
I guess I just...I don't
really understand them

05:39.006 --> 05:41.575
'cause, I don't know,
everyone seems so happy,

05:41.609 --> 05:44.578
but that seems odd
because someone just died.

05:44.612 --> 05:46.514
We all die, Sebastian,
doesn't mean

05:46.547 --> 05:48.549
we don't celebrate
the life that was led.

05:48.582 --> 05:51.819
Still, honoring the
soul doesn't mean

05:51.852 --> 05:55.489
we can't do everything we can
to hunt down the killer.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.891
So...

05:57.925 --> 05:59.793
get to work.
Oh.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.695
Uh, well, I'll see
your cartilage

06:01.729 --> 06:03.464
and I'll raise you
internal memory.

06:03.497 --> 06:06.867
Uh, I was able to recover photos
from Lieutenant Murray's camera,

06:06.900 --> 06:08.802
which, actually,
a little disappointing,

06:08.836 --> 06:10.804
'cause I didn't get to use
my advanced recovery software

06:10.838 --> 06:13.040
and that thing is...

06:13.073 --> 06:14.408
I know, "Sebastian, your point?"

06:14.442 --> 06:16.644
My point is that
nothing unusual popped up.

06:16.677 --> 06:20.180
Just a bunch of random
pictures of the procession.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.683
Almost like he was making
a photo album or something.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.818
Maybe he was looking for
somebody in particular.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.887
And that somebody
found him first.

06:26.920 --> 06:30.157
I.D. as many faces as you can
and get us the results.

06:30.190 --> 06:33.527
Focus on large men, tall.

06:33.561 --> 06:35.529
Hopefully Christopher
and Sonja will find some leads

06:35.563 --> 06:36.697
at Murray's place.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.571
WOMAN: Always paid his rent
on time, four years straight.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.839
Didn't see much
of him, though.

06:45.873 --> 06:48.676
One of them overly dedicated,
Navy types I guess.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.844
Don't think he had
any family either.

06:50.878 --> 06:54.548
Any idea how soon before
I can re

06:54.582 --> 06:57.618
Oh, you're pretty broken up
about his passing, are you?

06:59.587 --> 07:00.854
Everybody passes, honey.

07:00.888 --> 07:03.691
Life goes on,
bills need to be paid.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.526
Wise words.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.597
Oh, we'll take it
from here, honey.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.832
Thank you.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.467
But I'm sure you have

07:13.501 --> 07:15.569
a classified ad you have
to work on or something.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.139
A little hard on her there,
weren't you?

07:19.172 --> 07:22.476
A man dies and she acts
like it's no big deal.

07:22.510 --> 07:24.945
Well, if she didn't really
know him, it's not, is it?

07:24.978 --> 07:28.148
I mean, do you care when
somebody you barely know dies?

07:28.181 --> 07:30.651
I certainly don't act like
it's an inconvenience.

07:30.684 --> 07:32.486
Especially when it happens

07:32.520 --> 07:34.121
to somebody like
Lieutenant Murray.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.623
Means no family.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.491
Who's gonna celebrate his life?

07:37.525 --> 07:40.027
I don't suspect it matters
much to Lieutenant Murray.

07:41.529 --> 07:42.329
What?

07:42.362 --> 07:44.498
That's just
tough guy talk, right?

07:44.532 --> 07:45.799
You're not afraid of anything?

07:45.833 --> 07:47.267
Is that it?
No.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.869
No, I'm scared of things.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.003
Oh, yeah?
Like what?

07:50.037 --> 07:52.506
Like you kicking my butt.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.074
Well, if it knocks some sense

07:54.107 --> 07:57.911
into that Neanderthal brain of
yours, you're damn right I will.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.142
Don't move.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.945
Who are you?

08:34.181 --> 08:36.650
Come on... take it easy, now.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.586
Look, we can talk about this.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.187
You say something?

08:46.627 --> 08:48.295
Lasalle?

08:54.702 --> 08:55.302
:
Door.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.714
He's gone.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.882
Are you all right?

09:10.751 --> 09:12.252
Yeah, sure.

09:13.621 --> 09:15.623
Just got caught
off guard, that's all.

09:32.139 --> 09:34.041
Here.
Thanks.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.076
Are you sure you don't
need to get checked out?

09:36.109 --> 09:37.344
You're all right?

09:37.377 --> 09:38.879
Just a little sore, all right?

09:38.912 --> 09:40.180
It's no big deal.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.349
Sounds like
a big deal to me.

09:42.382 --> 09:44.317
Getting kicked that hard,
knocked down.

09:44.351 --> 09:48.188
Well, it's like I said, I got
caught off guard, all right?

09:48.221 --> 09:50.858
We weren't clearing the place,
so I wasn't expecting anyone.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.259
No, but I don't understand.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.094
Why didn't you call out
when you first saw him?

09:54.127 --> 09:55.228
What were you waiting for?

09:55.262 --> 09:57.865
Well, he surprised me
before I could.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.267
I mean, he's big and fast.
How big?

10:00.300 --> 10:01.935
Well, he's big enough
to be a suspect

10:01.969 --> 10:03.236
in Lieutenant Murray's murder.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.205
You get a look at him?

10:05.238 --> 10:06.339
Not a good one.

10:06.373 --> 10:07.975
It all happened so fast.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.078
So our mystery man
dropped a bag

10:11.111 --> 10:12.746
before he busted
through the door.

10:12.780 --> 10:16.950
I wasn't expecting it to be
a big ol' bag of bones.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.085
The question is,
what was Lieutenant Murray

10:18.118 --> 10:19.887
doing with 'em
in the first place?

10:19.920 --> 10:22.089
And why'd the assailant break
into his place to get them?

10:22.122 --> 10:23.957
Well, they look human to me.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.392
Agreed.
Hopefully Loretta can I.D. 'em

10:25.425 --> 10:27.728
and we can figure out
how they connect to Murray.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.396
Well, you want us
to bring 'em to Wade?

10:29.429 --> 10:33.901
Yeah. Brody and I'll go
talk to Murray' s CO...

10:33.934 --> 10:36.403
see if he's got any other...

10:36.436 --> 10:38.638
skeletons in his closet.

10:40.173 --> 10:43.243
WADE: The radius and ulna
are separated

10:43.276 --> 10:45.412
instead of fused.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.915
Vertebral surfaces are concave.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.417
Spinous is definitely human.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.152
Probably male,

10:52.185 --> 10:54.354
due to the structure
of the pelvis.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.023
It's a lot of decay.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.692
Whoever he is,
he's been dead a long time.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.828
How long?

11:00.861 --> 11:03.163
100 years, maybe more.
Mm-hmm.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.332
I won't know until
further analysis,

11:05.365 --> 11:07.334
and Sebastian can do
a DNA cross-check,

11:07.367 --> 11:08.702
see if we can identify him.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.170
Yeah, it might
help us figure out

11:10.203 --> 11:12.172
why the assailant
wanted him so badly.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.406
Hopefully find him.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.042
Yeah, and when
we find him,

11:15.075 --> 11:17.711
I got a little score to
settle with him.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.379
You okay?

11:21.514 --> 11:23.183
Why's everyone keep
asking me that?

11:23.216 --> 11:25.352
'Cause everyone cares
about you, caveman.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.420
How you sure you didn't crack
a rib or something?

11:27.454 --> 11:30.257
Oh, I've cracked a couple ribs
playing football in high school.

11:30.290 --> 11:31.324
This ain't that.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.793
Let's have a look.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.228
Look, I'm fine, really.
It's nothing.

11:35.262 --> 11:37.097
It's not nothing if where
the assailant kicked you

11:37.130 --> 11:38.398
is evidence.

11:38.431 --> 11:41.434
And there seems to be some
residue on your shirt too.

11:41.468 --> 11:42.402
Take it off.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.372
Is this really necessary?

11:45.405 --> 11:47.040
Oh come on, Country Mouse,

11:47.074 --> 11:49.376
show off those six-pack
abs you're so proud of.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.280
There is a faint outline

11:53.313 --> 11:55.883
of what looks to be a boot.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.317
I'm gonna have Sebastian
have a look at it.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.352
Maybe he can get us
a shoe size.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.154
Test the shirt, too.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.457
You're really enjoying this,
ain't you?

12:04.491 --> 12:07.060
Oh, yeah.
It's the highlight of my day.

12:09.496 --> 12:12.132
MAN:
Boyd went to him for
counseling.

12:12.165 --> 12:15.368
Lieutenant Murray was trying to
help him turn his life around.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.871
Boyd's wife never mentioned
Murray was in counseling.

12:17.905 --> 12:20.841
My understanding is Boyd wanted
to keep it confidential

12:20.874 --> 12:22.509
and Lieutenant Murray
honored that.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.444
Can we get a look at
Boyd's case file?

12:24.477 --> 12:26.513
I don't see why not.

12:26.546 --> 12:29.049
Lieutenant Murray lost his own
family in a plane crash.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.484
It's why he became a
psychologist and a CACO.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.353
He just wanted to help
other victim's families

12:33.386 --> 12:34.988
any way he could.

12:35.022 --> 12:37.858
It makes you wonder why anyone
would want to kill him.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.459
That's the thing--

12:39.492 --> 12:41.494
I can't imagine
why anybody would.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.997
He kept to himself pretty much.

12:44.031 --> 12:46.900
Nobody really knew what he
did on his personal time.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.168
That unusual?

12:48.201 --> 12:49.837
Yes and no.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.405
You deal with a lot of pain
as a Navy psychologist,

12:52.439 --> 12:53.841
and more so as a CACO.

12:53.874 --> 12:56.143
We're not robots,
it affects us too.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.311
Some more than others.

12:58.345 --> 13:02.950
Still odd that he was killed at
one of his own charge's funeral.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.417
Can't help but think
there's a connection.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.153
BRODY:
Speaking of odd,

13:06.186 --> 13:08.021
any idea why
we found human bones

13:08.055 --> 13:10.490
at Lieutenant Murray's place?

13:10.523 --> 13:12.325
Bones?
Yes.

13:12.359 --> 13:13.393
And we think
our main suspect

13:13.426 --> 13:14.862
tried to steal them, too.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.431
SONJA:
The bones are 300 years old?

13:18.465 --> 13:20.000
Are you sure about that?

13:20.033 --> 13:22.269
Eh, more like 250-ish.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.436
Radiocarbon dating

13:23.470 --> 13:26.306
can't get you
the exact date, but close.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.407
Give or take three years.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.276
Again, "ish."

13:29.309 --> 13:31.411
God, recent bones
I can get,

13:31.444 --> 13:34.848
murder victim, a cover up...
but old bones?

13:34.882 --> 13:37.417
Why is that worth
fighting for?

13:37.450 --> 13:38.618
I'm almost afraid to ask,

13:38.651 --> 13:40.587
but, uh, what does
"CPS" stand for?

13:40.620 --> 13:42.389
Cryogenic Preservation Society.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.456
Got that when I signed up.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.858
Dare I ask?

13:44.892 --> 13:46.493
You know, like
cryogenic freezing.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.497
When I die,
they're gonna take my head

13:50.530 --> 13:52.599
and they're gonna stick it in
a minus-200-degree container

13:52.632 --> 13:54.201
until future science

13:54.234 --> 13:56.369
can find a cure for whatever,
you know...

13:56.403 --> 13:58.005
killed me.

13:59.072 --> 14:00.373
Has present day science told you

14:00.407 --> 14:02.042
anything about
our murder weapon yet?

14:02.075 --> 14:03.276
No, I'm still working on that,

14:03.310 --> 14:05.212
but I was able to determine

14:05.245 --> 14:07.580
what kind of a boot
broke your ribs.

14:07.614 --> 14:10.050
Bruised, not broken.
Whatever.

14:10.083 --> 14:13.220
Okay, there's some kind of
issues happening there.

14:13.253 --> 14:14.554
Oh, by the way, your shirt had

14:14.587 --> 14:17.524
a little bit of
concrete dust on it.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.259
And as for the boot,
uh, it looks like

14:19.292 --> 14:21.128
it was a size 13 or 13 1/2,

14:21.161 --> 14:22.896
probably steel-toed,
based on the imprint

14:22.930 --> 14:25.232
left on your contused pec.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.633
Push

14:26.666 --> 14:28.235
A lot of 'em?

14:28.268 --> 14:29.602
Me, too.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.404
Don't encourage him.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.073
So, like Cinderella,

14:33.106 --> 14:35.442
all we have to do
is find who fits the shoe.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.277
Oh.

14:37.310 --> 14:40.147
Looks like we got
a match on a bone.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.883
All right, good news,
there's one living descendant.

14:45.618 --> 14:48.355
Huh... didn't expect
to see that name pop up.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.356
What name?

14:49.389 --> 14:51.024
Karl Baptiste.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.595
BRODY: Baptiste

14:55.628 --> 14:57.497
As in the one who originally
named New Orleans, New Orleans?

14:57.530 --> 14:59.199
Jean Baptiste.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.368
Karl's a distant relative.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.036
Still lives out at
the family plantation, too.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.504
Big spread.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.239
LASALLE:
Bet he was surprised to hear

15:06.273 --> 15:08.541
that his ancestor's
bones had been stolen.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.043
PRIDE:
He did seem surprised.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.578
Grave robbing?

15:11.611 --> 15:14.447
Been an epidemic in the city
for years, worse lately.

15:14.481 --> 15:17.550
Why cemeteries are
locked down at night now.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.420
Crypts are filled with
priceless artifacts, gold.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.555
It's like robbing
an unguarded bank.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.525
Ivory sculptures
and marble angels.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.727
I mean, this has got to
be worth a fortune.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.296
Still, it's hard to believe

15:29.329 --> 15:30.563
Lieutenant Murray's
a grave robber.

15:30.597 --> 15:31.564
I mean, it doesn't track.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.233
All the more reason to find out

15:33.266 --> 15:35.435
how he got the bones
in the first place.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.603
Mr. Baptiste?

15:36.636 --> 15:38.238
Special Agent Pride.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.239
This is my team.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.573
Glad to know you.
Hello.

15:40.607 --> 15:41.708
Although I still can't

15:41.741 --> 15:42.976
Hi.
wrap my head around it all.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.244
Yeah, I know how you feel.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.612
It's part of all our history,

15:45.645 --> 15:47.080
especially yours.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.648
A lot of generations
interred here, I'm sure.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.617
I hate to be exact.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.585
All the way back to the 1700s.

15:52.619 --> 15:53.720
Well, the family
crypt's over here.

15:53.753 --> 15:57.057
I have a guard on it 24/7.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.558
Because of all
the break

15:58.591 --> 16:00.493
Well, the black market's
gone crazy

16:00.527 --> 16:01.995
selling everything we hold dear.

16:02.029 --> 16:03.496
Nothing's sacred
to these criminals,

16:03.530 --> 16:05.698
but like I said,
I don't take any chances,

16:05.732 --> 16:08.701
so I find it hard to believe
anybody stole anything.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.671
Our forensic scientist
doesn't make mistakes.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.206
Well, let's hope he made one
in this case,

16:13.240 --> 16:15.175
'cause it doesn't make any sense
to steal bones,

16:15.208 --> 16:18.178
unless they stole what's
really worthwhile too.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.524
Dear God, it's gone.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.260
Everything, it's all gone.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.694
No, don't touch anything!

16:34.727 --> 16:37.730
This is now all evidence
in a crime scene.

16:37.764 --> 16:38.765
KARL:
I can't believe this. I...

16:41.468 --> 16:43.236
KARL: How could this
have happened?

16:43.270 --> 16:44.337
Hey, where you going?

16:44.371 --> 16:45.372
Hey!

16:48.541 --> 16:49.742
PRIDE:
Christopher!

16:52.145 --> 16:54.281
(grunts,
people yelling in protest)

16:54.314 --> 16:57.117
Federal agent! Stop!

17:06.826 --> 17:08.661
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't move.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.065
You want to see if my gun
dry fires too?

17:30.250 --> 17:31.651
Man, I ain't kill nobody.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.086
Really? Then how come
we found you

17:33.120 --> 17:35.322
sneaking around
a murder victim's house?

17:35.355 --> 17:36.723
Attacking a Federal agent.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.425
I told you, I didn't
know you was a Fed.

17:38.458 --> 17:39.426
I thought you
was after me.

17:39.459 --> 17:40.427
SONJA:
Why?

17:40.460 --> 17:41.828
Who else is after you?

17:44.297 --> 17:45.598
Yeah, you know what?
I ain't gonna say nothing else.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.467
I'm gonna wait for my mouth
to get here.

17:47.500 --> 17:48.801
Yeah, well, you
know what, Hanson?

17:48.835 --> 17:50.870
You're mouth ain't gonna
save your butt, all right?

17:50.903 --> 17:53.673
A Navy lieutenant is dead,

17:53.706 --> 17:54.807
and unless you
tell us otherwise,

17:54.841 --> 17:56.676
you got blood on your hands.

17:56.709 --> 17:59.179
Look, I know you're mad 'cause
I tried to shoot you,

17:59.212 --> 18:01.248
but I told you,
I didn't know.

18:01.281 --> 18:02.249
I didn't even mean to.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.650
Wait, wait, what?
And I...

18:03.683 --> 18:04.717
Let's just stick to the case.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.354
He just said he
tried to shoot you.

18:07.387 --> 18:08.655
My finger slipped,
I panicked.

18:08.688 --> 18:09.656
Yeah, his gun misfired,
all right?

18:09.689 --> 18:11.391
It-it doesn't matter.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.525
Like hell, it doesn't matter.

18:12.559 --> 18:13.626
Are you kidding me?

18:13.660 --> 18:16.663
We'll talk about this later.

18:21.368 --> 18:23.570
Something I said?

18:23.603 --> 18:26.339
You just incriminated yourself,
Mr. Hanson.

18:26.373 --> 18:27.640
Admitted to trying
to kill a Federal agent.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.542
I told you...

18:29.576 --> 18:30.643
It doesn't matter.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.579
Whether you mean to or not,

18:32.612 --> 18:33.646
it's still attempted murder.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.416
Eight years in the Federal pen,

18:36.449 --> 18:39.419
more 'cause of your priors,

18:39.452 --> 18:41.621
and a lot more if it turns out

18:41.654 --> 18:45.258
that you killed
Lieutenant Murray.

18:45.292 --> 18:46.726
Talk to me.

18:46.759 --> 18:49.796
Help us help you.

18:51.798 --> 18:55.335
I swear,
I never knew who the guy was

18:55.368 --> 18:57.604
until he started
asking me about Boyd.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.607
Boyd?
James Boyd?

19:00.640 --> 19:02.942
The reservist who was
killed in a car crash?

19:02.975 --> 19:05.912
Yeah, James and I, we knew
each other back in the day,

19:05.945 --> 19:09.616
in Treme, back before
he tried to go straight.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.451
Why he joined the Navy.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.787
Ah, come on, I knew
that wasn't gonna last.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.689
You can't change who you are.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.293
He got in some money troubles,

19:20.327 --> 19:21.928
Needed some cash.

19:21.961 --> 19:25.498
Folks was after him, so...

19:25.532 --> 19:26.533
he called me.

19:26.566 --> 19:27.800
To rob crypts.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.336
It's N'Oleans.

19:30.970 --> 19:33.640
I said I knew of a big take,
it was dangerous though.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.308
Why, because it was guarded?

19:35.342 --> 19:37.810
Nah.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.846
That ain't why it was dangerous.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.949
The Baptiste family,
they... they got roots.

19:42.982 --> 19:45.718
You don't want them finding
out you messed with them.

19:45.752 --> 19:49.722
So you and Boyd
robbed their crypt,

19:49.756 --> 19:50.790
and then what?

19:50.823 --> 19:52.959
We ran.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.861
We split up.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.996
He took the take and before
we could get back together

19:57.029 --> 20:00.233
to divvy it up, he, uh,
he crashed his car.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.803
He died ugly, I hear.

20:03.836 --> 20:07.674
A couple days later,
Murray was knocking on my door.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.576
Asking what?

20:09.609 --> 20:11.844
Just how well I knew James,

20:11.878 --> 20:13.513
when's the last time I saw him.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.348
See, I thought maybe he was
looking for the take, too,

20:15.382 --> 20:18.918
so, I followed him home,

20:18.951 --> 20:21.921
broke in when it was clear.

20:21.954 --> 20:24.824
Saw he had one of the bags and I
tried to take it, that's all.

20:24.857 --> 20:28.295
Risk all that for a...
bag of bones?

20:29.562 --> 20:31.631
Bones prove where
the artifacts came from.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.900
You can't sell one
without the other.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.703
But that take,

20:36.736 --> 20:37.937
especially that gold ring

20:37.970 --> 20:40.373
that everybody wants so bad,

20:40.407 --> 20:42.742
must be in the other bag.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.377
You don't know where it is?

20:44.411 --> 20:46.879
If I did, brother...

20:46.913 --> 20:48.648
I'd be rich and
long gone by now.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.922
How could you not tell me
you almost got shot?

20:55.955 --> 20:57.957
What, you forgot to mention
that little detail?

20:57.990 --> 20:59.659
Well, it's not a big deal.

20:59.692 --> 21:02.329
And why are you so
concerned about it?

21:02.362 --> 21:03.863
Why aren't you?

21:03.896 --> 21:05.832
What if his gun did fire?

21:05.865 --> 21:07.300
You could've been killed.

21:07.334 --> 21:08.501
You're being dramatic.

21:08.535 --> 21:09.736
Christopher...

21:09.769 --> 21:10.870
PRIDE: Hey.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.707
Come on, now.

21:16.843 --> 21:19.679
Let's just work
the case, all right?

21:19.712 --> 21:21.714
Start with the
reservist Boyd.

21:21.748 --> 21:25.518
I think we need to take
a closer look at him.

21:25.552 --> 21:27.354
Was a patient of
Lieutenant Murray's.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.856
Brody's got the case file, I'd
like to know what she's found.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.391
I'm on it.

21:33.360 --> 21:36.696
All right, what do
you want me to do?

21:38.064 --> 21:41.000
You want to tell me
what's going on?

21:41.033 --> 21:44.337
Really, it's just
a whole lot of nothing.

21:44.371 --> 21:46.606
No, Christopher, it's not.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.577
This is me you're talking to.

21:50.610 --> 21:55.648
And Sonja's right, you're lucky
that gun didn't go off.

21:55.682 --> 21:57.650
And not saying something
about it, says...

21:57.684 --> 22:00.787
Look, we take risks
all the time.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.789
But we don't always
nearly get killed.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.827
Face-to-face with mortality
affects a person.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.095
You're no different.

22:09.128 --> 22:12.665
Denying it doesn't do you
or anyone else any good.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.913
Tell me things.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.481
All right.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.583
Karl Baptiste gave
me an inventory

22:30.617 --> 22:33.453
of what was stolen
from the crypt.

22:33.486 --> 22:34.587
Ivory crosses,

22:34.621 --> 22:36.088
marble urns, angels,

22:36.122 --> 22:37.590
and a gold ring,

22:37.624 --> 22:39.926
which was apparently a gift
from King Louie the XIV.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.528
Estimated to be worth

22:41.561 --> 22:43.663
over a million dollars.
Well, this tracks

22:43.696 --> 22:45.765
with what Hanson said, that
he was at Lieutenant Murray's

22:45.798 --> 22:47.700
looking for more
than just bones.

22:47.734 --> 22:50.169
Yeah, and if he's right
about potential buyers,

22:50.202 --> 22:52.672
whoever still has the artifacts,

22:52.705 --> 22:54.841
is gonna need the
bones to sell too.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.075
LASALLE:
The question is

22:56.108 --> 22:57.844
where's the other bag?

22:57.877 --> 22:59.579
There's a lot of
loot out there somewhere,

22:59.612 --> 23:02.415
it's more than enough reason for
these robbers to kill for.

23:02.449 --> 23:04.551
It's a dangerous business
robbing crypts.

23:04.584 --> 23:07.520
There have been three murders in
this town in the past two years.

23:07.554 --> 23:09.021
Yeah, Lieutenant Murray
must've been suspicious

23:09.055 --> 23:10.923
of what Boyd was up to,

23:10.957 --> 23:13.426
otherwise why meet
Hanson at all?

23:13.460 --> 23:14.594
Well, according to
Murray's case file,

23:14.627 --> 23:16.028
Boyd was definitely
a troubled man.

23:16.062 --> 23:19.599
Gambling, debt,
hanging with the wrong folks.

23:19.632 --> 23:22.569
Looks like he was worried Boyd
was about to do something

23:22.602 --> 23:23.536
real bad.

23:23.570 --> 23:24.737
Baptiste's crypt.

23:24.771 --> 23:27.607
So maybe Lieutenant
Murray was killed

23:27.640 --> 23:29.742
following up on his suspicions.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.611
Well, just before
he died, though,

23:31.644 --> 23:34.581
Murray requested a copy of
Boyd's autopsy report

23:34.614 --> 23:35.582
from the Orleans Parish M.E.

23:35.615 --> 23:36.983
You think he was curious

23:37.016 --> 23:39.151
about how Boyd really died?
LASALLE: Well, if so,

23:39.185 --> 23:41.788
and Boyd was murdered,
maybe solving that

23:41.821 --> 23:43.623
will solve
Lieutenant Murray's murder, too.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.057
Brody, tell Loretta we need her.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.025
Christopher, Sonja,

23:46.058 --> 23:48.194
see who's trying to
sell those artifacts.

23:48.227 --> 23:49.529
Check black market,

23:49.562 --> 23:51.498
CI's...

23:51.531 --> 23:53.833
Our murderer's probably
one and the same.

23:59.639 --> 24:00.840
WADE:
This parish deals with

24:00.873 --> 24:03.843
five times the death rate
than ours does,

24:03.876 --> 24:05.812
but at a fraction of the budget.

24:05.845 --> 24:07.046
Why's that?

24:07.079 --> 24:10.517
More indigents, violent crimes.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.819
Dr. Bellamy can barely
keep up with exams,

24:12.852 --> 24:14.487
let alone lobby for funding.

24:15.722 --> 24:18.190
Steven, thanks for seeing us
on short notice.

24:18.224 --> 24:20.993
You know you're always
welcome here, Loretta.

24:21.027 --> 24:24.163
In fact, you might want to
run next term, take my job.

24:24.196 --> 24:25.598
I'm all right where I am,
thank you.

24:25.632 --> 24:28.568
I don't blame you.
Dwayne, how you been?

24:28.601 --> 24:29.869
How's Laurel?

24:29.902 --> 24:31.738
Doing just fine,
thanks for asking.

24:31.771 --> 24:33.673
This is Special Agent Brody,
she works with me.

24:33.706 --> 24:36.042
Nice to meet you.

24:36.075 --> 24:37.510
So, what brings you here?

24:37.544 --> 24:40.179
Navy Reservist James Boyd--
died a week ago.

24:40.212 --> 24:43.015
Boyd.

24:43.049 --> 24:46.686
You know, I can
hardly keep track.

24:46.719 --> 24:49.522
At least you got a name, though.

24:49.556 --> 24:51.624
Most poor souls end up here,

24:51.658 --> 24:56.629
they come in and out
as John and Jane Does.

24:56.663 --> 24:57.930
Oh, yeah, sure.

24:57.964 --> 25:00.633
Car accident, bad one too.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.769
Burned almost
beyond recognition.
Almost?

25:02.802 --> 25:04.637
Well, family's able to get me
dental records,

25:04.671 --> 25:07.139
and also ran DNA,
and postmortem radiographs.

25:07.173 --> 25:10.710
But you were able to
perform a full autopsy.

25:10.743 --> 25:12.278
Just to confirm C.O.D., I mean.

25:12.311 --> 25:13.946
What are you
suggesting, Loretta?

25:13.980 --> 25:15.815
Well, I'm not
suggesting anything,

25:15.848 --> 25:18.685
other than I remember what
it's like to be overwhelmed.

25:18.718 --> 25:21.187
And sometimes,
after you get an I.D.,

25:21.220 --> 25:23.322
and what seems like
an obvious cause of death...

25:23.355 --> 25:26.192
I didn't miss anything, I was
able to give him a full exam.

25:26.225 --> 25:28.828
All right, then you wouldn't
mind if we have another look.

25:28.861 --> 25:31.831
A lot on the line here,
maybe more than one murder.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.566
We didn't mean
to offend, Steven,

25:33.600 --> 25:35.702
we just need to make sure.

25:35.735 --> 25:37.136
No apologies necessary.

25:37.169 --> 25:39.639
There's nobody I trust more
to check my work than you.

25:39.672 --> 25:42.675
So, would you like me
to contact the family,

25:42.709 --> 25:44.176
request permission to exhume?

25:44.210 --> 25:46.579
Please.

25:49.115 --> 25:51.951
Thinking how that could've
been you in there?

25:51.984 --> 25:55.054
No, actually I'm thinking how
bad that body's gonna smell

25:55.087 --> 25:56.589
when they pop that lid.

25:56.623 --> 25:57.890
You don't fool me.

25:57.924 --> 26:00.593
The only reason you didn't say
what really happened

26:00.627 --> 26:02.228
is 'cause you were scared.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.630
I wasn't scared.
Come on.

26:03.663 --> 26:05.264
We worked together a long time.

26:05.297 --> 26:08.768
I know you and
your stupid macho front.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.136
Why don't you just admit it?

26:10.169 --> 26:13.172
All right, so maybe I was
a little scared,

26:13.205 --> 26:15.341
but I wasn't taught
to deal with death.

26:15.374 --> 26:16.943
All right?

26:16.976 --> 26:18.177
I was taught you do everything

26:18.210 --> 26:19.679
you can do to avoid it.

26:19.712 --> 26:20.613
Well, that's
really sad, Lasalle,

26:20.647 --> 26:22.081
'cause where I'm from,

26:22.114 --> 26:25.017
you run from death,
you run from life.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.021
WADE:
Hang on.

26:30.690 --> 26:31.758
Oh.

26:31.791 --> 26:32.859
MAN: Okay, open...

26:46.138 --> 26:48.140
Now, where's Boyd's body?

26:48.775 --> 26:49.809
Good question.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.355
Are they sure they exhumed
the correct coffin?

27:03.389 --> 27:05.692
LASALLE: Boyd's name was
on the vault it came out of.

27:05.725 --> 27:06.993
Only Boyd wasn't inside.

27:07.026 --> 27:09.028
WADE: Unless the body
was cremated.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.763
We did find ashes,

27:10.797 --> 27:12.765
although normally they're
only found in urns.

27:12.799 --> 27:15.334
But Boyd wasn't even supposed
to be cremated, was he?

27:15.367 --> 27:17.036
Not according to Dr. Bellamy.

27:17.069 --> 27:20.006
Still, somebody checked
the "Cremation" box

27:20.039 --> 27:21.774
on the "Designation of
Remains" form.

27:21.808 --> 27:23.710
But it wasn't the family,
we checked.

27:23.743 --> 27:25.044
Mortuary could've
made a mistake.

27:25.077 --> 27:26.779
Or Bellamy.

27:26.813 --> 27:30.349
Or somebody didn't want us to
know how Boyd really died.

27:30.382 --> 27:32.051
Especially if he was murdered.

27:32.084 --> 27:34.086
Sonja, Christopher,

27:34.120 --> 27:35.354
go to the mortuary.

27:35.387 --> 27:37.023
I want to know who
checked that box.

27:37.056 --> 27:39.959
We're on it.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.128
Any chance you can
still find the C.O.D.?

27:42.161 --> 27:45.264
DNA's usually destroyed during
the cremation process.

27:45.297 --> 27:48.701
I could try to find
a partial bone or tooth,

27:48.735 --> 27:50.870
or perhaps cell degradation.

27:50.903 --> 27:52.104
It's a long shot.

27:52.138 --> 27:53.840
Only shot we got.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.307
Wait, what did I miss?
Who got shot?

27:55.341 --> 27:57.710
Nobody, dear.
At least not yet.

27:57.744 --> 27:59.045
Wow. Okay.

27:59.078 --> 28:01.013
Well, taking that
not-so-subtle hint, uh,

28:01.047 --> 28:02.915
I think I solved
at least one murder.

28:03.916 --> 28:05.017
Lieutenant Murray?
Yeah.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.285
And I'm not gonna lie
to you either,

28:06.318 --> 28:08.154
it was not easy to match
a murder weapon

28:08.187 --> 28:09.822
to the exact friction
marks on the cartilage.

28:09.856 --> 28:13.425
I mean, I tried a fishing line,
all weights, piano wire,

28:13.459 --> 28:14.493
fiber optic...

28:14.526 --> 28:16.195
You know, why don't I just--
I'll skip to the end.

28:19.065 --> 28:20.466
Give me a second,
I did a lot of work.

28:20.499 --> 28:22.034
Sebastian...

28:22.068 --> 28:24.136
All right, here we go, uh,
Rose Iron.

28:24.170 --> 28:27.039
Uh, it matches microscopic
and corrosive dust

28:27.073 --> 28:28.407
that I found in the cartilage.
That...

28:28.440 --> 28:32.211
plus its width,
suggests harpsichord wire.

28:32.244 --> 28:34.180
Kind of like this one.
Except,

28:34.213 --> 28:36.048
Rose Iron was
replaced with brass

28:36.082 --> 28:37.349
in the 1700s,

28:37.383 --> 28:39.385
which means you're looking
for a murder weapon

28:39.418 --> 28:41.120
that's at least 300 years old.

28:41.153 --> 28:43.990
300 years?

28:44.023 --> 28:45.257
Just like the bones.

28:45.291 --> 28:46.759
You're not gonna
believe this,

28:46.793 --> 28:48.961
but Patton did a
search on the darknet

28:48.995 --> 28:50.029
looking for Baptiste's
stolen artifacts.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.931
And...?

28:51.964 --> 28:54.133
He didn't find Baptiste's, but
he did find artifacts stolen

28:54.166 --> 28:55.768
from other family crypts.

28:55.802 --> 28:59.138
Want to take a wild guess
who he traced the seller to?

29:08.147 --> 29:10.316
KARL: Well, this was unexpected,
Agent Pride.

29:10.349 --> 29:13.052
Did you, um, find anything?

29:14.987 --> 29:17.156
More than you wanted, I'm sure.

29:17.189 --> 29:20.993
Black eye on the city,
grave robbing.

29:21.027 --> 29:24.130
Strikes at the heart
of who we are.

29:24.163 --> 29:25.798
You know,
PD's been trying to find

29:25.832 --> 29:29.035
the ringleader for years now,

29:29.068 --> 29:30.136
turns out...

29:30.169 --> 29:32.138
it's you.

29:32.171 --> 29:33.873
:
What are you talking about?

29:33.906 --> 29:35.474
Hanson said,
"Nobody crosses Baptiste."

29:35.507 --> 29:37.109
Now we know why.

29:37.143 --> 29:39.145
We traced wire funds
instructions instructions

29:39.178 --> 29:42.214
of stolen artifacts to shadow
bank accounts linked to you.

29:44.216 --> 29:48.988
Perfect cover, nobody would
suspect a founding family.

29:49.021 --> 29:51.023
This doesn't prove anything.

29:51.057 --> 29:53.993
Proves trafficking of stolen
goods on the internet--

29:54.026 --> 29:55.161
Federal crime.

29:55.194 --> 29:56.528
So's killing sailors.

29:56.562 --> 29:58.831
Whoa, wait,
I didn't kill anybody.

29:58.865 --> 30:00.332
Why's everybody afraid of you?

30:00.366 --> 30:04.036
No one knows better than to rob
the Baptiste family crypt,

30:04.070 --> 30:05.304
except Boyd,

30:05.337 --> 30:07.506
who apparently was desperate
enough to try.

30:07.539 --> 30:09.375
Which Lieutenant Murray
suspected,

30:09.408 --> 30:11.577
but when he got on Boyd's trail,
you were afraid

30:11.610 --> 30:13.179
the investigation
would lead back to you.

30:13.212 --> 30:15.381
(playing a run up and down
the harpsichord keys)

30:15.414 --> 30:17.316
(single key clunking,
no note playing)

30:17.349 --> 30:19.318
No doubt the missing wire's
the murder weapon

30:19.351 --> 30:21.854
used to kill Lieutenant Murray.

30:21.888 --> 30:23.856
Missing wire? I...

30:23.890 --> 30:25.191
That must've been
what was taken

30:25.224 --> 30:27.259
when they broke
into my place, I...

30:27.293 --> 30:29.095
I didn't report it
'cause I-I didn't think

30:29.128 --> 30:31.330
anything was missing, but that's
obviously what they were after.

30:31.363 --> 30:32.865
Okay, let's...
But listen to me,

30:32.899 --> 30:34.200
I swear, I had no idea
Put your hands

30:34.233 --> 30:35.401
behind your back.
who this Murray person is.

30:35.434 --> 30:37.169
or Boyd, I...

30:37.203 --> 30:39.438
And even if I did,
why would I kill people

30:39.471 --> 30:41.273
who could help me
get my artifacts back.

30:41.307 --> 30:43.442
My ring.

30:43.475 --> 30:44.944
I swear,

30:44.977 --> 30:46.979
somebody's trying to set me up.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.119
Loretta's got something
to show me.

30:53.152 --> 30:54.353
Let's go.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.127
What'd you find?

31:01.160 --> 31:03.129
According to the mortuary,
the cremation form

31:03.162 --> 31:04.964
was already signed
when it got there.

31:04.997 --> 31:08.968
But I was able to locate a still
intact bone fragment

31:09.001 --> 31:11.037
in Reservist Boyd's ashes,

31:11.070 --> 31:12.204
enough to test DNA.

31:12.238 --> 31:13.472
Cause of death?
Don't know.

31:13.505 --> 31:15.141
But what I do know is

31:15.174 --> 31:16.508
those ashes don't belong
to Reservist Boyd.

31:16.542 --> 31:19.211
DNA matched
a 78-year-old homeless man

31:19.245 --> 31:21.180
who died two weeks ago--
John Doe.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.481
Who died in Orleans Parish.

31:22.514 --> 31:24.483
Dr. Bellamy's jurisdiction.

31:24.516 --> 31:25.985
All right, so where's Boyd?

31:26.018 --> 31:27.353
Well, I may not
know where he is,

31:27.386 --> 31:29.355
but I think I know where he was.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.223
So, I've been
working on the photos

31:31.257 --> 31:32.624
that Lieutenant Murray took
at Boyd's Second Line.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.260
And I was thinking,
he must've been

31:34.293 --> 31:36.095
looking for something, right?
But what? So...

31:36.128 --> 31:39.065
I kept magnifying
the photos until...

31:39.098 --> 31:40.599
viola, right there,
you see that?

31:40.632 --> 31:43.102
A reflection in the window?

31:43.135 --> 31:47.173
That, ladies and gentlemen,
is James Boyd...

31:48.640 --> 31:50.276
...alive and well,
at his own funeral.

32:02.521 --> 32:05.324
I still can't believe
Boyd faked his own death.

32:05.357 --> 32:07.293
I mean, you talk
about a Hail Mary.

32:07.326 --> 32:08.594
PRIDE:
Pinned himself into a corner,

32:08.627 --> 32:10.329
figured it was his only way out.

32:10.362 --> 32:12.264
So, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

32:12.298 --> 32:15.634
Boyd robs Baptiste's crypt,

32:15.667 --> 32:18.437
keeps the take,
pretends to be dead.

32:18.470 --> 32:21.140
So what was he doing
at his own funeral?

32:21.173 --> 32:22.441
It's a common fantasy
to be curious

32:22.474 --> 32:24.343
about who'd show up
at your funeral,

32:24.376 --> 32:26.445
so maybe Lieutenant Murray,
since he was Boyd's counselor,

32:26.478 --> 32:28.981
had reason to believe
he shared that fantasy.

32:29.015 --> 32:32.384
Which means, Murray showed up
at the funeral too,

32:32.418 --> 32:35.387
hoping to prove that Boyd
was still alive.

32:35.421 --> 32:38.424
Or Boyd was there
because, once he realized

32:38.457 --> 32:40.259
the lieutenant was on to him,

32:40.292 --> 32:42.328
he knew he had to try and stop
him before it was too late.

32:42.361 --> 32:45.531
And, either way, two birds
with one stone.

32:45.564 --> 32:48.367
Keeps anybody from thinking
Boyd's still alive,

32:48.400 --> 32:51.403
and eliminates the one man that
would want to kill him

32:51.437 --> 32:52.704
for stealing from him.

32:52.738 --> 32:54.606
Karl Baptiste.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.375
Yeah, but is Boyd that smart?

32:56.408 --> 32:58.410
More likely, that desperate.

32:58.444 --> 33:01.147
In debt, lot of bad people
chasing him,

33:01.180 --> 33:03.449
one thing lead to another,
things got worse.

33:03.482 --> 33:06.418
Navy took a chance on him,

33:06.452 --> 33:08.420
Boyd betrayed that trust.

33:08.454 --> 33:11.590
Even went so far as to
kill one of their own.

33:11.623 --> 33:13.092
We have to find him

33:13.125 --> 33:15.294
to face court martial.

33:15.327 --> 33:17.096
Yeah, but how do we know
he isn't long gone by now?

33:17.129 --> 33:19.398
Well, he hasn't been able to
sell the stolen artifacts.

33:19.431 --> 33:21.333
They're not even listed yet.

33:21.367 --> 33:23.269
The man goes to all that
trouble to disappear,

33:23.302 --> 33:25.171
he's gonna need money--
lots of it.

33:25.204 --> 33:26.405
I mean, he has to sell.

33:26.438 --> 33:27.573
Well, you can't sell
the artifacts

33:27.606 --> 33:29.475
without proving
where they came from.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.577
That's what Hanson said.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.212
Which means,
Boyd has the artifacts,

33:33.245 --> 33:34.680
but not the bones
to go with 'em.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.382
PRIDE:
Christopher, you and Sonja

33:36.415 --> 33:38.517
bring in Dr. Bellamy.

33:38.550 --> 33:40.519
He lied to us.

33:40.552 --> 33:43.422
He had to have helped Boyd
with that switch.

33:43.455 --> 33:45.157
And what if he lawyers up?

33:45.191 --> 33:47.559
Slows down
the investigation,

33:47.593 --> 33:50.229
and to give Boyd
enough time to bolt.

34:00.139 --> 34:02.508
You rethinking my offer
to switch parishes?

34:02.541 --> 34:06.545
No, but I wanted to talk
outside the office.

34:06.578 --> 34:08.414
Okay.

34:08.447 --> 34:09.748
Something wrong?

34:09.781 --> 34:12.684
Oh, come on, Steven,
who are you kidding?

34:12.718 --> 34:18.224
You knew I'd run DNA on the
ashes I found in Boyd's coffin.

34:18.257 --> 34:20.392
You knew what I'd find,
didn't you?

34:20.426 --> 34:22.394
Yes.

34:22.428 --> 34:25.231
Then what are you
still doing here?

34:25.264 --> 34:26.698
Why didn't you run?

34:26.732 --> 34:29.801
Where would I go?

34:31.603 --> 34:33.772
God, Steven...

34:33.805 --> 34:35.607
what happened to you?

34:35.641 --> 34:38.610
I just didn't think
you would ever

34:38.644 --> 34:40.446
have done something
like this.

34:40.479 --> 34:43.315
I don't know.

34:43.349 --> 34:47.553
Nobody cares about
me, my family...

34:47.586 --> 34:51.790
nobody cares I hardly
make ends meet.

34:51.823 --> 34:56.162
They just... expect.

34:56.195 --> 34:58.664
What do I get out of that?

34:58.697 --> 35:02.668
So you falsified Boyd's
death certificate,

35:02.701 --> 35:07.506
use a homeless man's ashes
to cover for him, for what?

35:07.539 --> 35:09.175
A couple bucks?

35:09.208 --> 35:10.509
I wouldn't be the first
M.E. in this town

35:10.542 --> 35:11.843
to do something like that.

35:11.877 --> 35:14.546
No, but you're the last
I'd expect to do it.

35:20.219 --> 35:23.222
Loretta... please?

35:23.255 --> 35:26.658
Do the right thing, Steven.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.260
Help us find James Boyd.

35:28.294 --> 35:29.428
I don't know where he is.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.230
Think.

35:31.263 --> 35:33.899
I swear, I don't know
where he is.

35:33.932 --> 35:35.334
Talked to him yesterday.

35:35.367 --> 35:37.169
Wait, you spoke to him
yesterday?

35:37.203 --> 35:40.272
He called.

35:40.306 --> 35:41.473
He wanted to know if...

35:41.507 --> 35:43.609
if I would carbon date
a bone for him.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.277
DNA test it.

35:45.311 --> 35:48.447
Said he needed it to
authenticate some kind of ring

35:48.480 --> 35:49.648
he was trying to sell.

35:49.681 --> 35:51.517
A ring?

35:51.550 --> 35:54.520
He's supposed to get back to me.
Haven't heard from him.

35:54.553 --> 35:56.288
Apparently, he doesn't have
the bone yet.

35:56.322 --> 35:57.789
That's because we've got it.

36:00.692 --> 36:04.396
Which means he needs
to find another...

36:11.970 --> 36:15.641
LASALLE:
It's been two nights.

36:15.674 --> 36:18.477
Thinking maybe the
good doctor was wrong.

36:18.510 --> 36:21.513
Boyd doesn't need
a bone after all.

36:25.584 --> 36:26.618
PRIDE :
Hold on.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.555
Got movement,
back-right corner.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.592
He's closing in.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.532
PRIDE: Stand by.

36:40.566 --> 36:42.901
Don't be stupid.

36:42.934 --> 36:44.736
Thanks for the
vote of confidence.

36:44.770 --> 36:45.937
PRIDE: Here we go.

36:45.971 --> 36:47.273
Three...

36:47.306 --> 36:50.442
two...one...

36:50.476 --> 36:51.443
now!

36:54.280 --> 36:55.747
We got a rabbit!

37:02.621 --> 37:03.955
Percy, heading your way.

37:16.302 --> 37:18.437
Federal agents! Stop!

37:22.808 --> 37:25.644
Don't move!
We will shoot you

37:26.778 --> 37:29.615
To quote a friend:
"Don't be stupid."

37:36.688 --> 37:39.024
The Navy tried to
help you, Boyd.

37:39.057 --> 37:41.727
Lieutenant Murray
tried to help you.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.862
And now there's
no one to help you.

37:43.895 --> 37:47.599
Please, don't tell my wife.

37:47.633 --> 37:50.536
It's better if
she thinks I'm gone.

37:50.569 --> 37:52.037
It's better
if she don't ever know.

37:54.773 --> 37:57.042
You should've thought
about that before.

38:04.583 --> 38:06.652
No fuss, no muss.

38:13.925 --> 38:16.728
The good news is we
nailed three bad guys.

38:16.762 --> 38:18.063
Four if you count Doc Bellamy.

38:18.096 --> 38:19.565
Bad news...

38:19.598 --> 38:21.400
Quadruple the paperwork.

38:21.433 --> 38:22.801
Yeah, it would've been nice

38:22.834 --> 38:24.636
if Brody would've
stuck around to help.

38:24.670 --> 38:25.737
And Pride.

38:25.771 --> 38:27.639
Well, Pride's got us
for paperwork,

38:27.673 --> 38:28.874
so, it's good to be king.

38:28.907 --> 38:31.743
Yeah, pun intended,
but what's Brody's excuse?

38:31.777 --> 38:33.479
She's got to get ready.

38:33.512 --> 38:35.481
And so do I.

38:35.514 --> 38:36.815
Where you going?

38:36.848 --> 38:38.016
Oh, Lieutenant Murray's
Second Line.

38:38.049 --> 38:39.685
The Navy guys are
putting it together.

38:39.718 --> 38:42.120
Okay, so what's that
got to do with this?

38:42.153 --> 38:43.121
Are you coming?

38:44.656 --> 38:46.492
It's Second Line, so no.

38:46.525 --> 38:48.660
Exactly. Enjoy.

38:48.694 --> 38:50.496
Wait, you can't just
dump all this on me.

38:50.529 --> 38:52.130
Well, come along.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.733
Well, you can't change the spots
on a leopard.

38:54.766 --> 38:57.703
Or a Neanderthal.
See you, Country Mouse.

38:57.736 --> 38:59.137
Okay, hold on.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.572
Let's get something
straight here.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.977
I did admit about being a little
scared about the misfire, right?

39:06.011 --> 39:07.679
Reluctantly.

39:07.713 --> 39:10.048
It's progress, not perfection.

39:10.081 --> 39:12.150
Look, I understand

39:12.183 --> 39:14.686
what you've been trying to say
to me, all right?

39:14.720 --> 39:15.954
And I appreciate it.

39:15.987 --> 39:17.756
I do.

39:17.789 --> 39:18.790
It means that you care about me

39:18.824 --> 39:19.825
more than you want to admit.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.527
Calm down.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.729
Now, you know what I mean.

39:23.762 --> 39:26.164
But I do appreciate it.

39:26.197 --> 39:29.535
I just... sometimes, I guess,

39:29.568 --> 39:30.836
you got to hit me
with a two by four

39:30.869 --> 39:32.003
to knock some sense into me.

39:32.037 --> 39:34.906
Mm-hmm.

39:34.940 --> 39:38.544
Look, we're partners, right?

39:38.577 --> 39:40.746
So we spend a lot of
time together.

39:40.779 --> 39:42.848
Get to know each other
in more ways than just work.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.716
Don't say "work husband."

39:44.750 --> 39:46.418
Don't worry.

39:46.452 --> 39:51.089
All I'm saying...
is you help me with my stuff,

39:51.122 --> 39:54.893
how not facing my past kept me

39:54.926 --> 39:58.730
from growing,
connecting better with others.

39:58.764 --> 40:01.767
Right back at you, Lasalle.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.068
Just saying.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.226
WADE:
I just love this city.

40:28.259 --> 40:29.795
Ditto that.

40:29.828 --> 40:31.930
So, how did this tradition
get started anyway?

40:31.963 --> 40:34.900
Some believe it started
in the slave days,

40:34.933 --> 40:37.168
the long walk back
from the cemetery

40:37.202 --> 40:38.837
outside the city...

40:38.870 --> 40:42.808
singing and dancing,
remembering the loved ones,

40:42.841 --> 40:46.678
and lessening the
hardship of the miles.

40:46.712 --> 40:48.847
Mm! Wikipedia Wade!

40:48.880 --> 40:50.849
Note to self, though,

40:50.882 --> 40:52.518
remind me to get photo approval

40:52.551 --> 40:54.920
before y'all put mine up
like that and show it off.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.822
Good point.

40:56.855 --> 40:58.690
It's a rich tradition;
never gets old.

40:58.724 --> 41:02.060
Kind of puts everything
in perspective.

41:02.093 --> 41:04.730
Yeah, perspective
Lasalle doesn't have,

41:04.763 --> 41:05.997
probably never will.

41:06.031 --> 41:08.033
Hey, don't be so hard on him.

41:08.066 --> 41:10.168
Christopher will come around,
sooner or later.

41:10.201 --> 41:11.770
Roll tide.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.138
