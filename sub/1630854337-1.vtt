00:30.832 --> 00:32.700
<i>Where are you?</i>

00:42.577 --> 00:43.745
<i>The Masi tree.</i>

00:45.547 --> 00:47.080
<i>The Masi tree</i>

00:49.617 --> 00:50.785
<i>The love inside me</i>

00:52.587 --> 00:54.789
<i>Will set you free</i>
<i>When I don't define love</i>

00:56.423 --> 00:57.692
<i>By the Masi tree.</i>

00:59.459 --> 01:00.828
<i>I look everywhere and see</i>

01:02.362 --> 01:04.364
<i>I look everywhere and ask myself</i>

01:06.734 --> 01:08.703
<i>"Is it just a nightmare?"</i>

01:14.374 --> 01:15.743
<i>Dreamless dreamers</i>

01:22.215 --> 01:23.618
<i>There are no stars here</i>

01:27.454 --> 01:30.123
<i>There are doors that open</i>
<i>To a place behind the sky</i>

01:36.163 --> 01:37.497
<i>But the computer</i>

01:39.333 --> 01:41.234
<i>Catches fire inside rainbows</i>

01:48.776 --> 01:50.410
<i>As all the lovers dance</i>

01:51.879 --> 01:53.781
<i>And completely disappear.</i>

01:58.352 --> 01:59.353
<i>Lovers.</i>

02:23.945 --> 02:25.212
Dreamed?

02:28.382 --> 02:31.119
It's early. What time is it?

02:34.488 --> 02:36.156
It doesn't matter.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.670
Do you love my shoulders?

02:49.436 --> 02:50.404
Yes.

02:52.372 --> 02:53.875
What part of my body
do you love the most?

02:54.709 --> 02:56.476
-My feet?
-Mm-hmm.

02:56.511 --> 02:57.712
My back?

02:58.946 --> 03:02.182
My hair? My nose? My lips?

03:03.250 --> 03:04.686
Everything.

03:05.720 --> 03:07.287
Everything?

03:08.589 --> 03:09.624
Mm-hmm.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.360
<i>Forever his inspiration</i>

03:15.797 --> 03:17.699
<i>We've always been a team</i>

03:20.001 --> 03:22.670
<i>But the artist is nothing</i>

03:24.672 --> 03:25.907
<i>Without his muse</i>

03:40.855 --> 03:44.291
<i>He sees</i>
<i>the beauty of life in my eyes</i>

03:48.963 --> 03:51.532
<i>It's all a beautiful confusion.</i>

03:54.602 --> 03:56.403
Are you going to be like this?

03:57.004 --> 03:58.305
You think it's interesting?

03:59.574 --> 04:01.475
What is this face?
Again, look at me.

04:01.509 --> 04:02.677
<i>Don't move.</i>

04:02.710 --> 04:04.045
<i>I didn't do anything at all.</i>

04:04.078 --> 04:05.412
<i>Look at me.</i>

04:06.881 --> 04:09.382
<i>I can't photograph your soul.</i>

04:09.416 --> 04:11.418
<i>I can photograph</i>
<i>your space in a way.</i>

04:15.656 --> 04:16.924
Uh, it's...

04:18.358 --> 04:19.961
something with
your body language.

04:21.696 --> 04:22.830
The way that you move.

04:26.901 --> 04:29.737
<i>But the artist is nothing</i>

04:29.771 --> 04:30.938
<i>Without his muse</i>

04:34.441 --> 04:35.408
Marker.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.580
- Set.
- Good.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.950
And... Action.

04:43.718 --> 04:45.987
You know,
I've seen everything

04:46.020 --> 04:47.487
<i>Taschen</i> has put out this year.

04:51.358 --> 04:52.527
It's good.

04:53.528 --> 04:54.862
Thank you.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.800
How hard was it for you to find

04:58.833 --> 05:00.968
and decide on the photographs
you wanted to collect

05:01.002 --> 05:02.804
-and use for your book?
-Hmm.

05:02.837 --> 05:06.007
Are you fed up
with celebrity life?

05:08.408 --> 05:10.077
It wasn't hard at all.

05:10.343 --> 05:12.013
I never liked celebrity culture.

05:12.046 --> 05:14.048
And I think--

05:14.081 --> 05:16.483
I think there are a lot
of talented people that I like.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.418
I mean, I love to know
about the people

05:18.451 --> 05:21.956
who create things because, um,
it helps me to understand

05:21.989 --> 05:23.591
the things that they create.

05:27.427 --> 05:30.565
<i>The butterfly</i>
<i>Who fell in love with the bee</i>

05:34.135 --> 05:36.571
<i>We-- We stand-in lovers</i>

05:38.906 --> 05:41.542
<i>Dancing blissfully</i>

05:41.576 --> 05:43.110
<i>In cerulean skies</i>

05:45.813 --> 05:47.949
<i>The one who always flutters</i>

05:50.117 --> 05:52.620
<i>Wandering wild</i>

05:54.589 --> 05:58.458
<i>Wishing on endlessly to be free</i>

06:02.129 --> 06:04.799
<i>And the other</i>

06:04.832 --> 06:06.634
<i>Bumbling, busy</i>

06:08.435 --> 06:09.670
<i>Laden</i>

06:11.105 --> 06:13.007
<i>Over-pollinated with love.</i>

06:17.812 --> 06:20.413

06:24.585 --> 06:27.021

What did you
do today?

08:32.713 --> 08:35.149
- Did some video work.
- Mm-hmm.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.318
- <i>Did you miss me?</i>
<i>- I did.</i>

08:37.351 --> 08:38.786
How much did you miss me?

08:38.819 --> 08:40.121
<i>A lot.</i>

08:42.957 --> 08:44.158
<i>Tell me I'm beautiful.</i>

08:44.992 --> 08:46.227
You are beautiful.

08:46.260 --> 08:47.161
Dance with me.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.797
Dance with you?

08:50.598 --> 08:51.565
Where? Here?

08:56.637 --> 08:57.938
I can't dance. Come on.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.741
Am I your favorite girl
to photograph?

09:00.775 --> 09:06.080
Hmm. You're my--
You're my favorite girl.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.715
<i>I want</i>
<i>to know who you are.</i>

09:09.083 --> 09:10.317
You still don't know?

09:14.789 --> 09:15.990
Not always sure.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.094
I don't know
what's going on in here

09:20.127 --> 09:21.262
when you look at me like that.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.331
I don't know
what's going on in there.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.904
What are you thinking about?

09:32.173 --> 09:34.208
A lot of things.

09:35.309 --> 09:36.811
Weird things.

09:41.115 --> 09:43.684
Tell me I am your favorite
girl to photograph.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.286
You're my favorite girl.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.255
<i>I love you.</i>

09:50.658 --> 09:52.726
Have you changed
since your beginning?

09:53.127 --> 09:54.695
I don't think in those terms.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.397
I think photography
has changed a lot

09:56.430 --> 09:58.099
in this last 15 years,

09:58.132 --> 10:00.167
especially with
the digital things.

10:00.201 --> 10:04.205
Anyone can take pictures now,
but what I can say is...

10:05.272 --> 10:06.674
...I don't take pictures.

10:07.208 --> 10:08.375
I make pictures.

10:12.847 --> 10:15.916
Your father was a famous painter
in the 1980s.

10:15.950 --> 10:17.818
He died at only 30 years old.

10:18.285 --> 10:21.188
How did his art influence you?

10:24.158 --> 10:27.094
I have a great admiration
for what he did as an artist.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.798
Photographing faces is
more complex than landscapes.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.968
You can't act afraid, Nicolas.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.669
You must be in control.

10:35.703 --> 10:38.105
-Excuse me.
-Hi.

10:38.139 --> 10:40.274
Would you be okay with my kid
taking a picture of you?

10:42.343 --> 10:43.410
Of course.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.814
Go ahead.

10:51.785 --> 10:55.089
You going to be
a photographer when you grow up?

10:55.122 --> 10:57.958
<i>Take pictures of things</i>
<i>that inspire you.</i>

10:57.992 --> 11:00.060
<i>If you see something beautiful,</i>

11:00.094 --> 11:02.263
<i>or something that catches</i>
<i>your eye, then go for it.</i>

11:02.296 --> 11:03.397
<i>Don't hold back.</i>

11:07.268 --> 11:08.736
What inspires you?

11:10.437 --> 11:13.040
That music right there.

11:22.483 --> 11:23.684
<i>I love you the most.</i>

11:24.985 --> 11:26.754
<i>Do you want me</i>
<i>to say it to you?</i>

11:26.787 --> 11:28.856
Yes. Say it to me.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.000
<i>No.</i>

12:49.103 --> 12:51.472
You know, what can an artist do
to grow creatively?

12:51.506 --> 12:54.008
To-- evolve?

12:56.544 --> 12:59.013
Everyone has to find
their own path.

12:59.046 --> 13:00.114
And what's your path?

13:02.850 --> 13:05.119
It's a constant struggle
with oneself.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.353
Um...

13:07.589 --> 13:09.023
I love you.

13:12.893 --> 13:15.262
<i>Do you believe in fate?</i>

13:15.296 --> 13:17.231
<i>Only when everything</i>
<i>good happens to me.</i>

13:35.049 --> 13:37.151
- <i>Kiss me.</i>
<i>- I am gonna kiss you.</i>

13:40.254 --> 13:41.623
<i>Give me a kiss.</i>

13:41.656 --> 13:43.957
Stop teasing me.

13:44.526 --> 13:46.594
- Am I?
- Yes, you are.

14:39.581 --> 14:41.048
We missed you today.

14:43.484 --> 14:45.319
Had a really good time
with Matilda.

14:45.352 --> 14:46.654
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:47.955 --> 14:49.423
We talked about going to Brazil.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.091
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

14:51.125 --> 14:54.261
- Brazil.
- Yes, yes, yes.

14:55.195 --> 14:58.132
I'd love to surf the waves
out there, man.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.287
Life.

15:20.688 --> 15:23.123
I mean, everything
has an influence on me.

15:23.157 --> 15:25.959
Women, men. You. Um--

15:26.193 --> 15:28.061
You have to steal

15:28.095 --> 15:31.131
because if you don't steal,
you cannot really do it.

15:31.165 --> 15:32.734
I mean, there are people who
think that they are original,

15:32.767 --> 15:33.967
but, um...

15:35.202 --> 15:36.236
they are not.

15:37.672 --> 15:40.240
I'm curious about your portrait
of the famous writer,

15:40.274 --> 15:41.709
Terry Collins.

15:41.975 --> 15:45.012
You-- You bring
something new of him.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.614
Uh--

15:47.247 --> 15:49.249
A coolness
I've never seen before.

15:49.950 --> 15:52.520
What is it that you put
from your personality

15:52.554 --> 15:53.655
into your images?

15:56.624 --> 15:59.326
Nothing is personal, Nicolas.

15:59.359 --> 16:00.994
<i>Everything is personal.</i>

16:01.028 --> 16:02.296
Every moment of
my existence is personal.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.031
-I'm a person.
- <i>I've worked with you</i>

16:04.064 --> 16:06.433
since you were 17,
and this is ridiculous.

16:06.967 --> 16:09.504
Maybe you need a vacation.
How do you feel?

16:09.970 --> 16:12.005
Don't lie to me, Nicolas.

16:13.207 --> 16:14.509
And everything is bullshit.

16:15.442 --> 16:18.111
I am trying to help you.

16:18.746 --> 16:21.583
You know you are my number one.

16:21.616 --> 16:23.016
<i>Our number one.</i>

16:23.618 --> 16:28.021
The world sees fashion's
superficial.

16:28.055 --> 16:30.190
It's a strange world
of business, you know?

16:30.224 --> 16:32.459
Do you know how many copies
my book sold?

16:32.493 --> 16:35.329
The client was unhappy
with your last--

16:35.362 --> 16:37.030
-Fuck the client.
-But we have to work

16:37.064 --> 16:38.600
with these people.
It's part of the job.

16:38.633 --> 16:40.502
<i>They want something new.</i>

16:40.535 --> 16:42.469
They said
your photographs were--

16:42.704 --> 16:44.539
were too dark.
Not enough colors.

16:44.572 --> 16:46.741
<i>They wanted to have fun.</i>

16:47.307 --> 16:50.110
They said your photographs don't
pop like they used to.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.713
You were a thousand miles away.

16:51.746 --> 16:53.715
You need a creative reset.

16:53.748 --> 16:55.683
<i>I don't know. Take Matilda</i>
<i>to Europe or something.</i>

16:55.717 --> 16:57.384
Try something new.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.353
Yeah, I don't need your help.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.523
Do you really believe
you're at the top of your game?

17:02.222 --> 17:03.658
-Fuck it.
-Okay, we're done here.

17:04.358 --> 17:05.259
Great.

17:06.861 --> 17:09.062
Can you define what you do?

17:13.735 --> 17:17.271
No. I don't want to define
what I do,

17:17.304 --> 17:19.072
and I don't like to define
what I'm doing.

17:19.106 --> 17:20.173
Um...

17:20.542 --> 17:22.677
I create. That's it.

17:28.850 --> 17:30.117
So what's your next project?

17:32.486 --> 17:34.756
I'm still working on it,
but you'll be the first to know.

17:39.827 --> 17:42.062
Do you even have
another project?

17:42.530 --> 17:44.632
Here we go.
Quiet, please. Thank you.

17:47.702 --> 17:49.504
Roll sound.
Thank you.

17:50.738 --> 17:52.574
Sam's meeting you.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.386
<i>Butterflies usually attempt</i>

18:06.420 --> 18:09.256
<i>to accumulate around</i>
<i>the base of the tongue.</i>

18:09.289 --> 18:11.325
<i>They don't hold</i>
<i>their tongue too straight</i>

18:11.358 --> 18:13.795
<i>like other types of flies.</i>

18:13.828 --> 18:16.196
<i>They curl it and...</i>

18:16.229 --> 18:17.799
<i>even more remarkably.</i>

18:17.832 --> 18:20.233
<i>They can put a sharp bend in it.</i>

18:20.267 --> 18:22.402
<i>These butterflies</i>
<i>have got pollen,</i>

18:22.436 --> 18:25.238
<i>not necessarily on its tongue,</i>

18:25.272 --> 18:27.609
<i>but all over</i>
<i>its pretty legs as well.</i>

20:06.908 --> 20:09.544
You once called me
your "Eternal Tiger."

20:11.579 --> 20:15.315
<i>Cassandra</i>
<i>was my greatest love.</i>

20:15.348 --> 20:17.217
<i>These flowers will fade</i>

20:17.985 --> 20:19.921
<i>and wilt,</i>

20:19.954 --> 20:21.756
<i>our love...</i>

20:22.757 --> 20:25.560
<i>will not.</i>

20:25.593 --> 20:27.962
<i>We both thought we would</i>

20:27.995 --> 20:29.931
<i>spend our eternity</i>
<i>just together.</i>

20:31.966 --> 20:33.968
<i>I think</i>

20:34.001 --> 20:35.870
<i>dreams do come true.</i>

20:37.437 --> 20:38.773
<i>If you believe...</i>

20:40.508 --> 20:42.510
<i>I'll never leave you Nicolas.</i>

20:44.411 --> 20:46.379
<i>Her actions</i>
<i>eventually altered</i>

20:46.413 --> 20:48.916
<i>parts of my subconscious.</i>

20:48.950 --> 20:50.918
<i>I do feel</i>
<i>dreams come true.</i>

20:51.819 --> 20:53.921
<i>I do.</i>

20:53.955 --> 20:56.456
<i>And changed the way</i>
<i>I view relationships.</i>

20:56.490 --> 20:57.892
<i>I just showed you exactly</i>

20:57.925 --> 20:59.459
<i>what our relationship is.</i>

21:00.027 --> 21:01.929
I hate who I become
when I'm with you.

21:01.963 --> 21:04.665
I can't live with you anymore.

21:04.699 --> 21:05.666
<i>So here we are...</i>

21:07.769 --> 21:12.339
<i>wasting my fucking time,</i>
<i>wasting my life away with you.</i>

21:12.372 --> 21:15.442
<i>I feel like I'm suffocating</i>
<i>in this relationship.</i>

21:16.544 --> 21:17.912
<i>Suffocating!</i>

21:23.383 --> 21:25.485
Yes, I fucked him.

21:25.520 --> 21:26.788
I fucked him.

21:34.529 --> 21:38.365
So, it's finding balance
between, um, life and art.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.668
Honesty always
gets my attention.

21:40.701 --> 21:42.870
Not particularly someone
who is honest to me,

21:42.904 --> 21:44.839
but someone who is honest
with himself.

21:51.112 --> 21:52.580
I'm very proud of you, you know?

21:52.613 --> 21:53.614
Hmm.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.585
Take it in. I'm--
I'm really proud of you.

21:58.986 --> 22:01.088
Yeah, but still,
I want to be something more.

22:03.991 --> 22:05.458
I'm lost, man.

22:06.828 --> 22:07.795
What do you mean by that?

22:12.033 --> 22:13.868
But I want to be free
when I create.

22:14.735 --> 22:16.070
Mm-hmm.

22:17.505 --> 22:19.507
-Free yourself.
-How?

22:20.675 --> 22:21.542
Let go...

22:22.043 --> 22:24.011
...have fun?

22:24.045 --> 22:25.613
-Do you remember what happened?
-Mm-hmm.

22:26.714 --> 22:28.783
You became a photographer.

22:28.816 --> 22:31.351
You were obsessed
with taking pictures.

22:31.886 --> 22:33.120
I envied that, man.

22:34.055 --> 22:35.790
I really did.

22:35.823 --> 22:36.924
-I know.
-I do.

22:36.958 --> 22:38.092
-I do.
-It's not enough.

22:42.196 --> 22:44.464
There's a fashion bubble
that needs to be burst.

22:46.567 --> 22:48.468
Fashion photography
holds me down.

22:48.970 --> 22:50.104
What do you mean?

22:52.573 --> 22:53.875
I don't know.

22:54.342 --> 22:56.077
I feel like a liar in a way.

22:57.044 --> 22:59.080
I get it, man. I do.

22:59.113 --> 23:00.548
-You know?
-It's crazy.

23:03.184 --> 23:04.151
Just...

23:06.520 --> 23:08.055
You got to find it in you,
you know?

23:10.457 --> 23:12.093
That's the tough part.

23:12.126 --> 23:13.794
Impossible.

23:15.863 --> 23:19.934
I was never interested in people
who doesn't do anything

23:19.967 --> 23:22.970
at the end of the day,
and just wears high heels

23:23.004 --> 23:25.573
and spends too much time
in front of a mirror.

23:26.741 --> 23:27.942
I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:30.144 --> 23:31.444
I have to be completely honest
with you.

23:33.981 --> 23:35.917
I need to know
how you grind your beans.

23:38.819 --> 23:41.055
I just taste your beans, coffee.

23:46.127 --> 23:49.196
<i>How do you feel</i>

23:50.264 --> 23:53.000
<i>about being unfaithful?</i>

23:53.034 --> 23:54.434
What do you want me to admit?

23:57.038 --> 23:58.606
Unfaithful is just a word.

24:03.577 --> 24:05.212
-Tell me.
-This coffee is shit.

24:05.713 --> 24:07.715
What do you mean?

24:07.748 --> 24:09.951
<i>The truth</i>
<i>is my life, but...</i>

24:09.984 --> 24:12.720
<i>sometimes I just want to escape</i>
<i>and be alone, you know?</i>

24:12.753 --> 24:14.522
<i>I think that's normal.</i>

24:14.555 --> 24:17.224
I mean that
there are no meanings

24:18.292 --> 24:20.561
and words are just words...

24:26.734 --> 24:28.169
where it's like...

24:29.036 --> 24:30.671
<i>relationships.</i>

24:31.906 --> 24:35.209
<i>Love. Marriage.</i>

24:37.244 --> 24:39.613
Unfaithful, cheating.

24:55.563 --> 24:56.931
Fucking.

24:56.964 --> 24:58.866
Yes, I fucked him.

25:00.768 --> 25:02.269
<i>Why do you put up</i>
<i>with these antics?</i>

25:17.218 --> 25:18.853
<i>I fucked you.</i>

26:23.117 --> 26:25.286
<i>Don't you see</i>
<i>how empty all of this is?</i>

26:26.754 --> 26:27.955
How empty you are.

26:48.876 --> 26:49.944
How was the party?

26:51.045 --> 26:52.313
It was good.

26:52.346 --> 26:53.714
You came home late.

26:55.783 --> 26:57.818
-It was a good party,
-Did Cedric have fun?

26:58.986 --> 26:59.987
I think so.

27:01.689 --> 27:02.923
Did you call your mother back?

27:06.994 --> 27:08.295
I think it'd be good if she
stayed with us

27:08.329 --> 27:09.396
for a couple of days.

27:13.167 --> 27:14.869
I'd like to get
to know her better

27:14.902 --> 27:16.170
and last time she came
it was a bit weird.

27:17.471 --> 27:18.973
Weird?

27:19.541 --> 27:22.009
I didn't know it was a problem
for you to speak to your mother.

27:25.779 --> 27:27.381
Why are you shutting me
out of your life?

27:28.215 --> 27:29.216
What do you mean?

27:30.117 --> 27:31.652
This is life.

27:50.905 --> 27:52.006
Mm.

27:52.706 --> 27:55.709
Is this the last gasp
of a dying artist?

28:13.460 --> 28:14.962
<i>Do you believe in fate?</i>

28:17.097 --> 28:18.432
<i>Are you serious?</i>

28:23.204 --> 28:24.238
If I'm honest.

28:25.372 --> 28:26.407
Which I try to be.

28:31.845 --> 28:33.414
Only when everything good
happens to me.

28:49.263 --> 28:50.464
Hey.

28:57.338 --> 28:58.906
Do you want some coffee?

29:23.397 --> 29:26.000
-It's Serena.
-Tell her I said hi.

29:26.867 --> 29:28.102
Hey, Serena.

29:32.507 --> 29:34.174
I am gonna
get ready for work.

29:34.509 --> 29:35.843
I'll be right back.

29:40.447 --> 29:44.451
He went for a wave, and...

29:45.386 --> 29:47.454
he went down, and he...

30:33.033 --> 30:34.201
<i>Do you remember Sophie?</i>

30:35.369 --> 30:36.403
<i>Who?</i>

30:37.338 --> 30:38.238
I don't know.

30:45.079 --> 30:47.181
No, no. Can we be
serious for a moment

30:47.214 --> 30:48.982
because it's really important?

30:49.016 --> 30:50.585
-I need to tell you.
-Yeah, I am listening.

30:51.586 --> 30:52.486
You are?

30:53.655 --> 30:55.055
Yeah?

30:55.289 --> 30:56.357
-Sophie.
-Mm-hmm.

31:02.564 --> 31:03.631
-Paul's mom?
-Oh, yeah.

31:06.066 --> 31:07.535
Paul's mom, man.

31:08.168 --> 31:10.037
Yeah.

31:11.673 --> 31:15.008
-Paul's mom. Fuck.
-Paul's mom, dude.

31:15.042 --> 31:17.077
-She was hot.
-She was hot.

31:18.445 --> 31:19.547
What?

31:20.582 --> 31:21.882
It's just that...

31:23.150 --> 31:24.485
I don't know.

31:24.853 --> 31:26.320
I mean,
she kind of looks like Paul.

31:26.755 --> 31:29.056
She does?

31:29.089 --> 31:30.290
Yeah, a little bit, I mean...

31:30.692 --> 31:33.127
-Yeah.
-No, she doesn't.

31:33.160 --> 31:34.895
- <i>No.</i>
<i>- But tell me about it.</i>

31:36.296 --> 31:38.600
I got-- I got the no.

31:42.537 --> 31:44.171
<i>Ah.</i>

31:46.541 --> 31:48.543
The greatest sadness

31:49.209 --> 31:51.945
is not being able to kiss
an invisible woman.

31:56.551 --> 31:57.951
We cannot touch it.

32:03.525 --> 32:05.025
I think we should go.

32:07.161 --> 32:08.663
-Where's the key?
-You know where key is?

32:08.863 --> 32:10.497
I don't know.
You were just driving.

32:20.374 --> 32:21.275
Sorry.

32:22.209 --> 32:23.143
I am so sorry.

32:38.125 --> 32:39.627
You look so much
like your father.

32:49.637 --> 32:52.540
Why don't you come with me to
New York for a couple of days?

32:52.740 --> 32:54.007
We talked about that, remember?

32:55.175 --> 32:56.310
And it's not a good idea.

32:56.778 --> 32:58.345
Why?

32:58.378 --> 32:59.313
Because it's not.

32:59.346 --> 33:00.481
I'm loving you.

33:01.549 --> 33:03.116
I care about you.

33:04.051 --> 33:07.154
You mean everything to me.
And I don't have anything else.

33:07.622 --> 33:09.624
- I am sorry.
- Okay.

33:11.593 --> 33:13.528
- I love you.
- Me too.

33:15.162 --> 33:16.731
I don't want to be without you.

33:23.538 --> 33:26.741
Look... Okay, come here

33:32.212 --> 33:33.313
Take care.

33:39.253 --> 33:40.354
Take care.

34:53.226 --> 34:54.796
I can't believe
I'm never going to see Cedric

34:54.829 --> 34:56.229
walking over here again.

34:57.865 --> 35:00.133
Nothing means anything anymore.

35:02.269 --> 35:03.370
I know.

35:07.709 --> 35:08.843
This is fucking chaos.

35:11.445 --> 35:12.747
Please don't leave me.

35:13.347 --> 35:14.682
I won't.

35:16.283 --> 35:18.519
- I can't do this all alone.
- I know.

35:20.420 --> 35:21.789
I know.

35:45.312 --> 35:46.446
<i>What's wrong?</i>

35:58.826 --> 36:00.360
<i>Everything's wrong.</i>

36:00.394 --> 36:01.629
<i>What do you mean</i>
<i>everything?</i>

36:06.801 --> 36:08.770
I want you...

36:09.504 --> 36:10.672
to fuck...

36:17.578 --> 36:18.813
You're home.

36:32.492 --> 36:33.628
I love you.

36:38.331 --> 36:39.867
It's okay to be lost.

36:52.580 --> 36:57.585
<i>My dispirited lover</i>

36:59.821 --> 37:01.321
<i>Your patterns</i>

37:02.690 --> 37:03.925
<i>Are fading.</i>

37:07.360 --> 37:08.896
<i>I'm wandering</i>

37:10.665 --> 37:11.899
<i>Wistful</i>

37:13.534 --> 37:14.501
<i>Nicolas</i>

37:15.570 --> 37:16.604
<i>Where are--</i>

37:16.637 --> 37:17.839
Thank you.

37:19.607 --> 37:21.274
I feel pretty good.

37:21.308 --> 37:22.342
<i>Is something bothering you?</i>

37:28.415 --> 37:30.985
Photoshoot was crazy.

37:31.018 --> 37:32.920
You argued with the clients.

37:32.954 --> 37:34.789
You left the studio.

37:34.822 --> 37:36.691
It was very awkward
between you and the model.

37:39.660 --> 37:41.461
How is your life?

37:41.495 --> 37:42.462
Are you still in love?

37:43.998 --> 37:45.499
It's complicated.

37:47.501 --> 37:48.703
<i>We still</i>
<i>love each other, but...</i>

37:48.736 --> 37:50.303
Come on.

37:50.905 --> 37:52.507
something is broken.

37:53.741 --> 37:55.442
Look at me.

37:55.475 --> 37:56.577
<i>So what?</i>

37:56.978 --> 37:58.746
Clients are usually uptight.

37:59.046 --> 38:01.616
What happened?

38:01.649 --> 38:03.951
<i>Well, you need</i>
<i>to impose yourself just...</i>

38:05.653 --> 38:07.420
<i>take control</i>
<i>and don't give a shit.</i>

38:07.454 --> 38:08.589
<i>Don't be so aggressive,</i>
<i>Nicolas.</i>

38:08.623 --> 38:10.658
Don't move.

38:10.691 --> 38:12.660
You're just gonna
stare at me and judge me, right?

38:12.693 --> 38:15.096
That's-- That's your position.

38:15.129 --> 38:16.998
<i>How do you live like this?</i>

38:17.031 --> 38:18.933
<i>Yes, he seems</i>
<i>to be changing now.</i>

38:18.966 --> 38:21.736
<i>You know, I don't care anymore.</i>

38:21.769 --> 38:24.906
<i>I have been disrespected</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

38:25.873 --> 38:28.375
Okay, that's good.
Move up. Are you afraid of me?

38:28.408 --> 38:29.977
- Maybe you let me out.
- Are you scared?

38:30.011 --> 38:31.444
<i>Oh, I hit a nerve.</i>

38:35.917 --> 38:37.484
You okay?

38:37.685 --> 38:39.821
You are so mean to me.

38:39.854 --> 38:43.791
Fuck off Nicolas
you fucking little brat.

38:43.825 --> 38:45.827
You're fucking selfish.

38:45.860 --> 38:47.094
<i>Do you have any secrets?</i>

39:04.645 --> 39:05.947
You make me sick!

39:12.954 --> 39:14.487
This is not what I want.

39:15.422 --> 39:16.724
Do something new.

39:16.757 --> 39:18.659
I have seen this.
Do something new.

39:20.027 --> 39:22.997
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

39:23.631 --> 39:25.833
I don't wanna shoot
with you anymore.

39:27.467 --> 39:28.669
You're making me crazy.

39:35.109 --> 39:36.644
<i>Don't touch me.</i>

39:39.614 --> 39:41.448
<i>How do you live like this?</i>

39:43.450 --> 39:44.819
<i>Let me out...</i>

40:02.003 --> 40:03.905
Aren't you afraid
that people are going to see

40:03.938 --> 40:05.072
what a fraud you are?

40:06.874 --> 40:08.042
You know what I see?

40:10.044 --> 40:11.078
Fear.

40:14.916 --> 40:16.416
You waltz in here...

40:19.120 --> 40:21.822
like you're
some kind of magician.

40:31.666 --> 40:32.800
Hey.

40:37.038 --> 40:38.706
Hey, what are you doing?

40:45.079 --> 40:47.048
You're pretending to ask me
what am I doing,

40:47.081 --> 40:49.150
but the real question is,
why am I doing it?

40:49.183 --> 40:50.483
Right?

40:52.987 --> 40:54.121
Why I am working?

40:56.991 --> 40:58.092
Yeah?

41:01.562 --> 41:02.563
Because I can.

41:17.745 --> 41:20.114
I am sorry. I am sorry.

41:25.853 --> 41:27.487
Let's drink wine
and make love.

41:29.190 --> 41:31.592
I'm gonna go outside first
and get some air.

41:31.625 --> 41:32.827
No.

41:32.860 --> 41:34.595
-Nicolas, stop now.
-No.

41:35.029 --> 41:36.163
You're hurting me.

41:37.865 --> 41:39.166
Shh.

41:39.767 --> 41:40.868
Please.

41:42.236 --> 41:43.604
Hey...

42:04.959 --> 42:06.794
Something you can fix.

42:16.904 --> 42:18.239
Hit me.

42:20.674 --> 42:21.575
No?

42:23.077 --> 42:24.311
You like that?

42:25.279 --> 42:26.914
I break things.

42:26.947 --> 42:28.115
You clean up.

42:29.083 --> 42:31.619
No? You don't like it?

42:35.256 --> 42:36.857
Okay.

42:37.658 --> 42:40.861
I don't want to irritate you,
but you're an artist.

42:40.895 --> 42:43.164
You write poems. You are good.

42:43.197 --> 42:44.799
Yeah, so?

42:44.832 --> 42:46.333
You can't even
believe yourself now.

42:46.367 --> 42:48.035
You want to teach me
how to live my life?

42:48.069 --> 42:49.303
You want to teach me
how to survive?

42:50.204 --> 42:51.572
Go ahead. Come on.

42:54.108 --> 42:56.677
Come on. You believe
that you are better than me?

42:56.710 --> 42:58.145
You are not better than me.

42:58.746 --> 43:01.182
Forget about us.
We don't exist.

43:01.215 --> 43:02.750
Get out of my face.

43:02.783 --> 43:04.285
-Fuck you, Matilda.
-Hey!

43:05.419 --> 43:06.854
Fuck you!

43:07.321 --> 43:08.956
You know what it is, Nicolas?

43:10.157 --> 43:11.692
You're afraid.

43:12.426 --> 43:14.628
And you can't even see it
because you're so arrogant.

43:14.662 --> 43:16.330
Fucking look at yourself
right now!

43:18.032 --> 43:19.800
I am sorry.

43:23.871 --> 43:25.372
Stop it.

43:25.406 --> 43:26.740
-Don't fucking touch me.
-Fuck off.

43:28.709 --> 43:29.910
Get out.

43:30.111 --> 43:31.278
Go. Let me work now.

43:35.416 --> 43:36.984
It's 8:00AM!

43:40.955 --> 43:42.323
Stop it.

43:57.171 --> 43:59.340
<i>Are you daydreaming?</i>

44:03.344 --> 44:04.945
You don't know shit.

44:04.979 --> 44:06.780
When are you going
to get fucking real?

44:06.814 --> 44:09.383
And you better get real,
fucking fast.

44:51.926 --> 44:52.960
Matilda.

46:16.877 --> 46:17.545
Hello?

46:20.114 --> 46:21.282
Matilda?

46:23.350 --> 46:24.418
Hello?

46:36.497 --> 46:41.001
Are you Nicolas Yarna?

46:41.035 --> 46:43.037
<i>Are you wondering</i>
<i>where Matilda is?</i>

46:43.070 --> 46:45.039
<i>I'll ask you a final time.</i>

46:45.072 --> 46:47.007
<i>Are you wondering</i>
<i>where Matilda is?</i>

46:48.942 --> 46:50.578
- <i>Do I have your attention?</i>
-Yes.

46:50.844 --> 46:55.082
Meet me at the Hotel Vista Tide
at 9 p.m.

46:55.115 --> 46:59.153
<i>Room 1009. 1009.</i>
<i>The door will be open.</i>

46:59.186 --> 47:00.522
<i>Do you understand?</i>

47:00.755 --> 47:02.156
What the fuck is this?

47:04.526 --> 47:05.959
<i>Did you hear something?</i>

48:52.132 --> 48:54.001
Where is Matilda?

48:54.034 --> 48:55.235
<i>Good, you can</i>
<i>follow instructions.</i>

48:56.236 --> 48:58.005
Where is she?

48:58.038 --> 49:00.274
<i>You keep asking</i>
<i>the wrong questions.</i>

49:00.307 --> 49:03.545
Besides, anticipation
is the greatest pleasure.

49:04.044 --> 49:06.213
If you don't tell me
where Matilda is, I'm going to--

49:06.246 --> 49:07.615
Do tell, Mr. Yarna.

49:08.449 --> 49:09.617
What are you going to do?

49:11.519 --> 49:15.289
That's the sound of a man
realizing he's not in control.

49:18.292 --> 49:19.694
Who is this
and what do you want?

49:22.630 --> 49:24.064
Where is she?

49:25.499 --> 49:27.034
Is she okay?

49:27.067 --> 49:29.403
When things
start to feel strange,

49:29.436 --> 49:32.640
<i>you should stop and check</i>
<i>your surroundings.</i>

49:45.319 --> 49:46.554
<i>When things start</i>

49:46.588 --> 49:49.189
<i>to feel strange,</i>

49:49.223 --> 49:51.726
<i>you should stop and check</i>
<i>your surroundings.</i>

50:00.702 --> 50:02.202
<i>It's a lovely dress.</i>

50:04.204 --> 50:07.207
Unfortunately she wore it
under those circumstances.

50:19.587 --> 50:21.154
<i>Are you wondering</i>

50:21.188 --> 50:22.189
<i>where Matilda is?</i>

50:29.296 --> 50:30.698
<i>Do I have your attention?</i>

50:58.125 --> 50:58.826
Yes?

51:00.460 --> 51:02.764
<i>Don't worry.</i>

51:02.797 --> 51:05.833
<i>It's easy to lose</i>
<i>when it's weighing us down.</i>

51:33.160 --> 51:35.863
<i>Darkness extinguishes light.</i>

51:39.667 --> 51:41.335
<i>They can coexist.</i>

51:50.745 --> 51:52.479
<i>The light has left you.</i>

52:13.400 --> 52:15.268
Do you know where she is?
She's lost.

52:18.506 --> 52:20.775
<i>All luminescence, eventually,</i>

52:20.808 --> 52:22.777
<i>fades to this.</i>

52:25.847 --> 52:27.882
Are you daydreaming?

52:32.854 --> 52:35.188
<i>I know</i>
<i>what you dream at night.</i>

52:37.324 --> 52:39.359
I don't ever want
to hear your voice again.

52:52.874 --> 52:54.441
I apologize.

52:54.876 --> 52:56.544
You were looking for
some peace and quiet.

52:56.577 --> 52:57.912
It's okay.

53:01.816 --> 53:03.417
I haven't seen you here before.

53:04.886 --> 53:06.486
It's the first time.

53:06.821 --> 53:08.455
I spend too much time here.

53:11.959 --> 53:14.461
Did you know the only part of
the human body

53:14.494 --> 53:15.897
that requires sleep

53:16.531 --> 53:17.932
is the brain?

53:19.033 --> 53:21.435
You can... run,

53:22.837 --> 53:25.840
walk, fuck...

53:28.710 --> 53:29.744
twenty-four hours a day.

53:32.279 --> 53:34.381
Just the brain
that can't keep up.

53:34.414 --> 53:36.316
I'm most tired when I travel.

53:37.685 --> 53:39.687
I'm so excited to leave. But...

53:40.320 --> 53:42.957
when I arrive at my destination,
it's my brain.

53:44.659 --> 53:46.226
There's a tough time adapting.

53:51.699 --> 53:52.834
I'm Hannah.

53:54.035 --> 53:55.235
Nicolas.

53:56.436 --> 53:57.538
It's nice to meet you.

53:57.805 --> 53:58.940
You too.

54:00.575 --> 54:01.709
May I tell you a story?

54:05.780 --> 54:07.882
It's funny, I promise.

54:11.085 --> 54:12.754
When I was 16,

54:14.488 --> 54:16.657
there was this 31 year old
that I was dating.

54:18.593 --> 54:19.994
On a trip to Norway,

54:21.361 --> 54:22.997
we found this small town

54:23.030 --> 54:26.801
surrounded by 100 tiny lakes.

54:29.369 --> 54:30.437
All of a sudden, I...

54:32.439 --> 54:34.709
I felt the urge to make love
with him for the first time.

54:37.078 --> 54:38.546
I was still a virgin.

54:40.915 --> 54:42.984
That part of the forest
was dangerous

54:43.551 --> 54:46.687
because there was a species
of man-eating wolves.

54:48.823 --> 54:50.323
I undressed...

54:52.860 --> 54:54.529
he entered inside of me,

54:55.963 --> 54:58.498
and we were
waving our flashlights

54:58.533 --> 55:00.500
and making all these
strange noises

55:01.235 --> 55:03.571
so that the wolves
would stay away.

55:07.575 --> 55:09.544
I dream about that sometimes

55:09.977 --> 55:11.779
when I'm making love
to other men.

55:12.880 --> 55:14.549
And when it happens, I...

55:15.216 --> 55:17.384
have to stop having sex.

55:18.653 --> 55:21.354
Because my burst
of laughter goes on

55:21.388 --> 55:22.957
without ever coming
to a stop.

55:34.869 --> 55:36.336
I'm going to go for a swim.

55:52.086 --> 55:53.588
<i>You have a secret.</i>

55:55.923 --> 55:57.058
<i>I'm psychic.</i>

56:09.937 --> 56:11.873
Relax, you can tell me.

56:13.007 --> 56:14.374
Relax.

56:18.512 --> 56:20.480
- We all have them.
- I've lost something.

56:21.582 --> 56:24.952
Something or someone?

56:29.824 --> 56:32.693
My girlfriend, she's gone.

56:35.696 --> 56:37.031
She's left you

56:37.531 --> 56:40.034
or she's gone missing?

56:43.004 --> 56:46.707
I'm at the hotel because I
got a strange phone call.

56:46.741 --> 56:48.408
I hoped it was Matilda.

56:51.212 --> 56:52.613
Who was it?

56:53.480 --> 56:55.016
I was beginning
to think it was you.

56:57.952 --> 56:59.754
No, that's too cruel.

57:02.957 --> 57:04.025
Even for me.

57:08.129 --> 57:10.463
I went to this room
and I got a call...

57:12.199 --> 57:13.534
but it was cryptic.

57:15.870 --> 57:17.104
And you have no other clues?

57:17.872 --> 57:19.006
Nothing.

57:26.914 --> 57:29.083
That there's nothing
to be gained by being here?

57:40.995 --> 57:42.163
You coming?

58:57.772 --> 58:59.907
I have the package
for Mr. Yorke.

59:05.212 --> 59:07.581
You are an hour late.

59:12.153 --> 59:13.287
I understand that.

59:15.623 --> 59:16.857
I'm sorry.

59:29.236 --> 59:30.571
He's here to learn.

59:32.706 --> 59:33.908
No more mistakes.

59:52.193 --> 59:53.227
-Hello.
-Thomas.

59:59.233 --> 1:00:01.302
This is my new friend, Nicolas.

1:00:03.037 --> 1:00:04.271
Nicolas.

1:00:05.773 --> 1:00:07.208
My name is Thomas.

1:00:07.241 --> 1:00:08.242
How about a drink?

1:00:08.543 --> 1:00:10.377
Scotch, bourbon, rye?

1:00:11.078 --> 1:00:12.746
Soda pop?

1:00:12.780 --> 1:00:14.048
Are you having
a glass of scotch?

1:00:14.815 --> 1:00:15.816
Maybe.

1:00:17.852 --> 1:00:18.752
Come in.

1:00:25.059 --> 1:00:26.360
Sit down.

1:00:29.897 --> 1:00:31.899
I've missed talking to you
in person.

1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:34.668
When did you get back
from India?

1:00:34.702 --> 1:00:35.402
India?

1:00:36.871 --> 1:00:38.372
Uh, about a week ago, I think.

1:00:40.040 --> 1:00:41.375
I was there for six months.

1:00:42.176 --> 1:00:43.277
India.

1:00:44.879 --> 1:00:46.280
Have to go back in January.

1:00:48.749 --> 1:00:49.850
Thank you.

1:00:49.884 --> 1:00:51.018
-Nicolas.
-Thank you.

1:00:53.454 --> 1:00:54.855
And where are you from?

1:00:56.357 --> 1:00:59.960
I was born in Naples, but when I
was ten, I moved to New York.

1:00:59.994 --> 1:01:00.895
Um-hmm.

1:01:02.229 --> 1:01:03.164
Where are you now?

1:01:06.133 --> 1:01:07.201
I'm in Los Angeles.

1:01:13.107 --> 1:01:14.074
Where are you?

1:01:19.280 --> 1:01:20.881
Where are you?

1:01:23.417 --> 1:01:25.119
Don't you mean I just told you?

1:01:27.388 --> 1:01:29.323
Was New York stressful to you?

1:01:32.293 --> 1:01:34.328
Uh, no.

1:01:34.361 --> 1:01:36.330
Uh, I like to change.

1:01:36.363 --> 1:01:38.098
I used to travel a lot.

1:01:38.132 --> 1:01:39.433
Nicolas is a photographer.

1:01:40.301 --> 1:01:42.036
So you're an artist. Ah.

1:01:43.237 --> 1:01:44.872
So you're an artist.

1:01:45.239 --> 1:01:46.440
I'm interested in people.

1:01:49.443 --> 1:01:50.344
What are you most afraid of?

1:01:54.415 --> 1:01:56.050
I don't need to be
analyzed right now,

1:01:56.083 --> 1:01:58.452
but thank you for your interest.

1:02:02.990 --> 1:02:06.327
Uh, are you afraid to see
who you really are?

1:02:08.195 --> 1:02:11.365
Is it because you are afraid
to see who you are?

1:02:13.167 --> 1:02:14.401
Strange.

1:02:15.936 --> 1:02:17.871
I see you're
interested in people,

1:02:17.905 --> 1:02:19.373
but you are cut off
from yourself.

1:02:23.043 --> 1:02:24.512
Living and dying.

1:02:24.546 --> 1:02:26.514
Identical twins in the Matrix.

1:02:28.082 --> 1:02:29.383
Shadow and light.

1:02:29.584 --> 1:02:30.851
Light and shadow.

1:02:32.486 --> 1:02:35.422
You know how that feels,
don't you, Nicolas?

1:02:38.560 --> 1:02:40.160
Excuse me.

1:02:41.128 --> 1:02:42.463
If I say childhood,

1:02:44.331 --> 1:02:45.466
what comes to mind?

1:02:45.499 --> 1:02:47.801
I think
it's time to go.

1:02:47.835 --> 1:02:49.436
- <i>What?</i>
<i>- I think you heard me.</i>

1:02:49.470 --> 1:02:50.771
That's enough.

1:02:51.372 --> 1:02:52.540
We're going.

1:02:58.212 --> 1:02:59.947
This was a mistake. Sorry.

1:03:04.285 --> 1:03:05.252
Good night.

1:03:09.591 --> 1:03:11.292
Wicked people of the night.

1:03:15.162 --> 1:03:17.031
Mr. Yorke
doesn't like it

1:03:17.064 --> 1:03:18.399
when his plans change.

1:03:24.004 --> 1:03:26.541
<i>Wicked</i>
<i>people of the night.</i>

1:03:37.619 --> 1:03:39.019
<i>I'm beginning to...</i>

1:03:41.422 --> 1:03:43.490
<i>forget the shape of your face...</i>

1:03:46.327 --> 1:03:47.961
<i>Where am I?</i>

1:03:51.365 --> 1:03:53.000
<i>I hear things...</i>

1:03:55.502 --> 1:03:56.937
<i>you once said to me.</i>

1:03:58.472 --> 1:04:00.374
<i>Spoken.</i>

1:04:00.407 --> 1:04:02.409
<i>by unfamiliar faces.</i>

1:04:02.443 --> 1:04:04.912
<i>We're alive when we</i>
<i>just fall from the sky.</i>

1:04:07.348 --> 1:04:09.116
<i>It was</i>
<i>an almost perfect wave.</i>

1:04:10.417 --> 1:04:13.087
<i>I got this feeling,</i>

1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:14.589
<i>this rush, like...</i>

1:04:16.990 --> 1:04:18.192
<i>I was a part of everything.</i>

1:04:19.460 --> 1:04:21.028
You know,
I didn't exist anymore.

1:04:24.198 --> 1:04:25.966
And I froze.

1:04:25.999 --> 1:04:28.402
<i>Time stood still.</i>

1:04:28.435 --> 1:04:34.208
<i>What shape is your heart</i>
<i>when it's really, really broken?</i>

1:04:35.543 --> 1:04:36.511
<i>There is no shape.</i>

1:04:37.978 --> 1:04:39.547
<i>Because it's an illusion...</i>

1:04:41.482 --> 1:04:45.119
<i>until you know you are...</i>

1:04:45.152 --> 1:04:50.190
<i>Why do you feel life is strange</i>
<i>when it gets really strange?</i>

1:04:54.662 --> 1:04:56.130
What if I fail?

1:04:58.232 --> 1:04:59.466
<i>We loved.</i>

1:05:01.736 --> 1:05:03.137
<i>From hate.</i>

1:05:03.170 --> 1:05:05.072
Stop it. Don't fucking touch me.

1:05:05.105 --> 1:05:06.541
<i>And because</i>
<i>we set things on fire.</i>

1:05:08.442 --> 1:05:11.579
What if... I took it

1:05:11.613 --> 1:05:12.680
and it was the ride of my life?

1:05:16.751 --> 1:05:18.520
I knew I'd never
have that chance again.

1:05:21.523 --> 1:05:23.056
<i>Where are you?</i>

1:05:23.090 --> 1:05:25.593
<i>It's okay to be lost.</i>

1:05:25.627 --> 1:05:26.628
<i>Where is she?</i>

1:05:29.731 --> 1:05:32.534
<i>When things start</i>
<i>to feel strange...</i>

1:05:32.567 --> 1:05:35.035
<i>you should probably stop</i>

1:05:35.068 --> 1:05:36.571
<i>and check your surroundings.</i>

1:05:56.156 --> 1:05:57.357
Hannah.

1:06:03.598 --> 1:06:04.699
Is she dead?

1:06:07.501 --> 1:06:08.670
I know her.

1:06:10.070 --> 1:06:11.506
I have been working with her.

1:06:16.778 --> 1:06:19.179
<i>You are the woman on the phone.</i>

1:06:19.213 --> 1:06:21.281
<i>I want the truth</i>

1:06:21.315 --> 1:06:24.084
<i>It's your turn now.</i>

1:06:24.117 --> 1:06:26.253
<i>Who do you</i>
<i>think you're fooling?</i>

1:06:26.286 --> 1:06:28.288
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>what is all this charade?</i>

1:06:28.489 --> 1:06:29.724
The least you can do
is be honest with me.

1:06:30.390 --> 1:06:31.759
Where's Matilda?

1:06:33.327 --> 1:06:36.196
<i>I don't know.</i>

1:06:36.230 --> 1:06:38.600
<i>Since I saw you</i>
<i>in that black and white movie,</i>

1:06:38.633 --> 1:06:41.201
<i>my life was unraveled.</i>

1:06:41.235 --> 1:06:42.236
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

1:06:43.370 --> 1:06:44.404
<i>I don't know.</i>

1:06:45.707 --> 1:06:46.774
<i>Do I need a lawyer?</i>

1:06:49.276 --> 1:06:51.378
Only guilty people
need lawyers.

1:06:52.547 --> 1:06:53.748
Never mind about her.

1:06:56.450 --> 1:06:57.652
<i>Shadow and light.</i>

1:06:59.453 --> 1:07:02.189
Take care of yourself.

1:07:02.222 --> 1:07:05.292
- <i>Light and shadow.</i>
- Now.

1:07:05.325 --> 1:07:08.095
<i>Identical twins in the Matrix.</i>

1:07:08.128 --> 1:07:09.363
<i>You know what I see?</i>

1:07:10.464 --> 1:07:11.666
<i>Fear.</i>

1:07:13.868 --> 1:07:17.371
<i>I see a scared little shot.</i>

1:07:17.404 --> 1:07:20.842
<i>You know shit</i>
<i>and you better get real fast.</i>

1:07:20.875 --> 1:07:23.210
Let me guess.

1:07:23.243 --> 1:07:25.847
<i>You have never seen the victim</i>
<i>before your in your life, right?</i>

1:07:25.880 --> 1:07:27.347
<i>What's your relationship</i>
<i>to Hannah?</i>

1:07:27.381 --> 1:07:29.316
There's a hell
of a lot you don't know.

1:07:30.618 --> 1:07:32.252
When was the last time
you saw her?

1:07:32.286 --> 1:07:33.621
You're that pretty boy

1:07:33.655 --> 1:07:35.590
fashion photographer,
aren't you?

1:07:35.623 --> 1:07:38.492
You're the one that
takes all those pictures

1:07:38.526 --> 1:07:42.062
of that gorgeous girls for
<i>Details</i> magazine, am I right?

1:07:44.766 --> 1:07:45.767
You hate <i>Details?</i>

1:07:48.368 --> 1:07:49.537
No.

1:07:50.905 --> 1:07:52.607
I've read about you.

1:07:53.675 --> 1:07:55.375
Seen all your interviews.

1:07:56.544 --> 1:07:59.179
Talking about the truth
like you intended.

1:08:00.113 --> 1:08:03.818
So I got to look people in
the eye, criminals, thieves,

1:08:04.652 --> 1:08:07.555
liars, degenerates.

1:08:07.922 --> 1:08:09.691
I got to look for the truth
in their eyes,

1:08:09.724 --> 1:08:11.491
day in, day out.

1:08:11.893 --> 1:08:13.628
Usually, I don't find it...

1:08:14.829 --> 1:08:17.197
but every so often.

1:08:18.298 --> 1:08:19.399
I see the truth...

1:08:21.501 --> 1:08:23.136
and I know it.

1:08:23.437 --> 1:08:24.606
So I'll tell you what.

1:08:26.173 --> 1:08:27.809
Why don't we start this again...

1:08:29.777 --> 1:08:33.113
and you give me some
of that truth for a change, huh?

1:08:38.519 --> 1:08:40.287
You're a photographer.

1:08:40.320 --> 1:08:42.790
You think you see the truth,
but you don't.

1:08:42.991 --> 1:08:44.592
Your camera sees it.

1:08:45.059 --> 1:08:47.160
I don't got no fancy camera.

1:08:49.396 --> 1:08:51.331
Now get the fuck out of here.
Go.

1:08:53.200 --> 1:08:54.902
Oh, one more thing.

1:09:05.713 --> 1:09:07.515
Aren't you afraid
that people are going to see

1:09:07.548 --> 1:09:08.783
what a fraud you are?

1:09:21.729 --> 1:09:23.463
<i>Butterflies usually attempt</i>

1:09:23.497 --> 1:09:26.199
<i>to accumulate around</i>
<i>the base of the tongue.</i>

1:09:26.233 --> 1:09:28.335
<i>They don't hold</i>
<i>their tongue too straight</i>

1:09:28.368 --> 1:09:30.672
<i>like other types of flies.</i>
<i>They--</i>

1:09:35.677 --> 1:09:38.245
<i>These butterflies have got...</i>

1:09:39.413 --> 1:09:42.382
<i>not necessarily on its tongue,</i>

1:09:42.416 --> 1:09:43.951
<i>but all over</i>
<i>its pretty legs as well.</i>

1:10:24.291 --> 1:10:26.426
"Know thyself,
for thou knowest his power:

1:10:27.729 --> 1:10:29.630
then put on a new mind."

1:11:01.662 --> 1:11:02.630
<i>Where is Matilda?</i>

1:11:04.565 --> 1:11:06.701
<i>You keep asking</i>
<i>the wrong questions.</i>

1:11:08.970 --> 1:11:11.371
<i>It's a lovely dress.</i>

1:11:11.404 --> 1:11:13.941
<i>Where are you now?</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

1:11:30.925 --> 1:11:33.360
Hello, Nicolas.

1:11:33.861 --> 1:11:35.897
When was the last time
you heard Matilda's voice?

1:11:41.903 --> 1:11:43.538
What the fuck
is going on, Hannah?

1:11:43.571 --> 1:11:44.906
No, you-- I am Kate.

1:11:44.939 --> 1:11:46.507
You met my sister, Hannah.

1:11:46.707 --> 1:11:47.909
Your sister?

1:11:48.176 --> 1:11:49.811
My twin.

1:11:50.945 --> 1:11:53.014
Do I really look
better on the telephone?

1:11:55.716 --> 1:11:56.951
I don't know what to believe.

1:12:05.860 --> 1:12:07.628
Did Hannah kill Margaret, then?

1:12:07.962 --> 1:12:09.897
No, don't be silly.

1:12:12.033 --> 1:12:14.501
I don't know what's real.

1:12:14.535 --> 1:12:16.070
<i>But when was the last time</i>
<i>you heard Matilda's voice?</i>

1:12:17.605 --> 1:12:18.773
Do you want to hear it?

1:12:23.144 --> 1:12:25.378
Do you want to hear it?
Do you want to hear it?

1:12:26.914 --> 1:12:28.082
Do you want to?

1:12:29.482 --> 1:12:30.985
There's one thing
you need to know.

1:12:31.018 --> 1:12:32.987
- Where is she?
- No, okay.

1:12:33.020 --> 1:12:34.655
Your emotions.

1:12:35.056 --> 1:12:36.958
They mean nothing to me.

1:12:42.964 --> 1:12:44.565
I want you to play this.

1:12:46.100 --> 1:12:47.668
<i>I told you</i>

1:12:47.702 --> 1:12:49.670
<i>not to try to find me.</i>

1:12:49.704 --> 1:12:50.938
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1:12:58.179 --> 1:12:59.647
Take me to her.

1:13:30.477 --> 1:13:32.079
I know what you're thinking.

1:15:15.116 --> 1:15:16.684
So, who is he?

1:15:17.118 --> 1:15:19.987
Someone she fell in love with?
Someone she's fucking?

1:15:21.622 --> 1:15:23.290
Nicolas, did you
ever really love her?

1:15:26.127 --> 1:15:27.194
Think about it.

1:15:29.797 --> 1:15:33.601
Hey! Nicolas, give me
your fucking money.

1:15:33.868 --> 1:15:35.302
- Calm down.
- Shut up.

1:16:00.761 --> 1:16:03.364
<i>The love inside me...</i>

1:16:03.397 --> 1:16:05.833
<i>will set you free</i>
<i>when I don't define love.</i>

1:16:11.105 --> 1:16:12.339
<i>I look everywhere and see.</i>

1:16:17.111 --> 1:16:19.113
<i>I look everywhere</i>
<i>and ask myself...</i>

1:16:22.383 --> 1:16:23.784
Hey.

1:16:25.286 --> 1:16:26.854
<i>I feel pretty good.</i>

1:16:26.887 --> 1:16:28.189
<i>Where are you now?</i>

1:16:33.060 --> 1:16:34.728
You say you're
interested in people,

1:16:35.229 --> 1:16:36.864
but you are cut off
from yourself.

1:16:45.239 --> 1:16:46.340
<i>Who is this man?</i>

1:16:48.876 --> 1:16:51.245
<i>He's not even</i>
<i>supposed to be here.</i>

1:17:02.223 --> 1:17:03.858
<i>Where are you?</i>

1:17:27.381 --> 1:17:28.983
<i>Dreamless dreamers.</i>

1:17:32.386 --> 1:17:33.821
<i>There are no stars here.</i>

1:17:39.293 --> 1:17:42.396
<i>There are doors that open</i>
<i>to a place behind the sky.</i>

1:17:49.370 --> 1:17:51.272
<i>As all the lovers dance...</i>

1:17:54.208 --> 1:17:55.409
<i>and completely disappear.</i>

1:18:08.289 --> 1:18:11.025
<i>Nicolas, where are you?</i>

1:18:30.077 --> 1:18:31.445
<i>Dreamless dreamers.</i>

1:18:32.446 --> 1:18:33.814
<i>There are no stars here.</i>

1:18:39.086 --> 1:18:41.855
<i>Nicolas, where are you?</i>

1:19:58.065 --> 1:19:59.166
Why did you save me?

1:20:03.404 --> 1:20:04.838
I don't decide.

1:20:06.073 --> 1:20:07.542
God put you in my way.

1:20:09.043 --> 1:20:10.578
He who fights.

1:20:11.879 --> 1:20:12.880
That is my name.

1:20:18.919 --> 1:20:20.120
Do you ever think about death?

1:20:23.957 --> 1:20:24.958
When I was at war,

1:20:26.193 --> 1:20:27.127
death was all around.

1:20:32.600 --> 1:20:34.068
<i>I'm afraid of death.</i>

1:20:36.604 --> 1:20:38.005
<i>But I'm afraid</i>
<i>of everything, really.</i>

1:20:42.242 --> 1:20:45.112
Fear... is always there.

1:20:50.951 --> 1:20:52.554
I no longer waste my time

1:20:52.587 --> 1:20:54.421
learning about things
I have no control over.

1:21:00.160 --> 1:21:01.563
<i>I had a girlfriend.</i>

1:21:03.063 --> 1:21:06.033
But I was lost and unhappy.

1:21:08.168 --> 1:21:10.371
<i>And when I felt her love,</i>
<i>I was ashamed.</i>

1:21:11.372 --> 1:21:12.406
<i>So she disappeared.</i>

1:21:19.413 --> 1:21:20.515
I don't know where to go.

1:21:22.717 --> 1:21:25.285
<i>But you have</i>
<i>known all along.</i>

1:21:40.535 --> 1:21:41.902
<i>Nicolas.</i>

1:21:51.746 --> 1:21:53.247
Stop the car.

1:21:59.420 --> 1:22:00.454
<i>Nicolas.</i>

1:22:16.103 --> 1:22:17.271
Matilda!

1:22:23.043 --> 1:22:24.546
<i>Tell me what's going on.</i>

1:22:26.313 --> 1:22:28.048
<i>You hurt? Are you okay?</i>

1:22:32.319 --> 1:22:33.655
Matilda!

1:22:35.255 --> 1:22:36.256
Where are we?

1:22:37.491 --> 1:22:38.726
I can't explain.

1:22:39.661 --> 1:22:40.728
Weird things happened to me.

1:22:43.631 --> 1:22:45.065
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>that was the plan.</i>

1:22:46.467 --> 1:22:47.401
What plan?

1:22:52.172 --> 1:22:53.106
What plan?

1:22:57.077 --> 1:22:59.146
I almost got killed by a man.

1:22:59.747 --> 1:23:02.249
You were saying that
it was part of the plan?

1:23:02.282 --> 1:23:05.319
I almost got killed by a man,
and it was part of the plan?

1:23:05.520 --> 1:23:06.754
Are you crazy?

1:23:06.788 --> 1:23:08.422
-I did it for you.
-For me?

1:23:08.455 --> 1:23:10.758
I know it's crazy.

1:23:10.792 --> 1:23:13.060
Okay? I had to do something.

1:23:14.495 --> 1:23:16.196
You are destroying yourself.

1:23:19.534 --> 1:23:20.702
I did it for you.

1:23:22.637 --> 1:23:24.037
I don't know who you are.

1:23:27.207 --> 1:23:28.776
I know it's crazy.

1:23:30.410 --> 1:23:32.246
It's a crazy fucking plan.

1:23:32.279 --> 1:23:34.381
But what the fuck
did you expect me to do?

1:23:38.151 --> 1:23:40.387
<i>Before I disappeared,</i>

1:23:40.420 --> 1:23:41.455
<i>I kept having this dream.</i>

1:23:43.625 --> 1:23:45.025
<i>And in this dream,</i>

1:23:46.628 --> 1:23:48.763
<i>you were looking for me,</i>

1:23:48.796 --> 1:23:50.632
<i>but you could never find me.</i>

1:23:53.400 --> 1:23:57.839
<i>And I was there and I screamed.</i>
<i>And I would scream</i>

1:23:57.872 --> 1:23:59.741
<i>and call for you,</i>
<i>but you'd never hear me.</i>

1:24:03.443 --> 1:24:06.581
<i>The greatest sadness</i>

1:24:06.614 --> 1:24:09.551
<i>is not being able to kiss</i>
<i>an invisible woman.</i>

1:24:09.584 --> 1:24:11.084
<i>We're standing</i>
<i>right next to each other</i>

1:24:11.118 --> 1:24:12.185
<i>in the darkness.</i>

1:24:13.755 --> 1:24:15.055
<i>Nicolas.</i>

1:24:17.257 --> 1:24:18.793
<i>Before I disappeared,</i>

1:24:20.127 --> 1:24:22.062
we kept trying
to define what love is.

1:24:24.464 --> 1:24:27.602
I am trying to label it,
give it a meaning,

1:24:27.635 --> 1:24:29.804
but love can't be defined.

1:24:34.274 --> 1:24:36.578
<i>It wasn't working</i>
<i>and I was so lost.</i>

1:24:37.779 --> 1:24:39.647
Do you understand?
I was so lost.

1:24:42.416 --> 1:24:43.283
Sorry.

1:24:44.351 --> 1:24:46.320
It's okay.

1:24:46.353 --> 1:24:47.589
<i>There's so much</i>
<i>distance between us.</i>

1:24:51.191 --> 1:24:55.329
I found you. I am sorry.

1:25:02.202 --> 1:25:03.503
You saw things, didn't you?

1:25:04.171 --> 1:25:04.872
I can't explain.

1:25:06.541 --> 1:25:07.875
Weird things happened to me.

1:25:08.308 --> 1:25:09.611
You can't explain...

1:25:11.244 --> 1:25:12.312
what you saw.

1:25:13.648 --> 1:25:15.415
But you can
say that you've seen.

1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:20.888
<i>Are you Nicolas?</i>

1:25:20.922 --> 1:25:23.223
...thousand miles away.

1:25:23.256 --> 1:25:24.491
<i>When was the last time</i>
<i>you heard Matilda's voice?</i>

1:25:24.525 --> 1:25:26.393
-Where are you?
-I saw you.

1:25:26.426 --> 1:25:28.195
<i>He's here to learn.</i>

1:25:28.228 --> 1:25:29.530
<i>Are you wondering</i>
<i>where Matilda is?</i>

1:25:29.564 --> 1:25:31.532
<i>She just disappeared.</i>

1:25:31.566 --> 1:25:32.734
- <i>It's okay to be lost.</i>
<i>- Where are you?</i>

1:25:32.767 --> 1:25:34.301
<i>I love you.</i>

1:25:34.334 --> 1:25:37.739
<i>Matilda, I found you.</i>

1:25:37.772 --> 1:25:39.373
<i>I've been here all along.</i>

1:25:58.893 --> 1:26:00.394
<i>The messy tree.</i>

1:26:02.295 --> 1:26:03.631
<i>The messy tree.</i>

1:26:05.633 --> 1:26:08.268
<i>The love inside me...</i>

1:26:08.301 --> 1:26:10.538
<i>Will set you free</i>
<i>When I don't define love</i>

1:26:12.006 --> 1:26:13.407
<i>By the messy tree.</i>

1:26:16.276 --> 1:26:17.545
<i>Look everywhere and see</i>

1:26:20.414 --> 1:26:22.215
<i>I look everywhere and ask myself</i>

1:26:26.888 --> 1:26:28.321
<i>"Is it just a nightmare?"</i>

1:26:36.764 --> 1:26:38.465
<i>Dreamless dreamers</i>

1:26:41.035 --> 1:26:42.537
<i>There are no stars here</i>

1:26:46.440 --> 1:26:48.910
<i>There are doors that open</i>
<i>To a place behind the sky</i>

1:26:56.483 --> 1:26:57.852
<i>But the computer</i>

1:27:02.322 --> 1:27:04.592
<i>Catches fire inside rainbows</i>

1:27:11.331 --> 1:27:13.000
<i>As all the lovers dance</i>

1:27:18.005 --> 1:27:20.240
<i>And completely disappear.</i>

1:27:41.929 --> 1:27:43.263
<i>Love.</i>

1:30:08.776 --> 1:30:09.944
Thank you.

1:34:49.123 --> 1:34:50.457
<i>Where are you?</i>
