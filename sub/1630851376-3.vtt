We made it.

gonna head home.

- I'm on drugs, and I love you.

19:10.148 --> 19:11.570
- Wait, what?

19:11.670 --> 19:14.273
- No, that's another club
on the east side.

19:17.797 --> 19:20.220
- No bracelet, no entry.
- Tom, what are you doing?

19:20.320 --> 19:22.723
- I'm being your wingman.
- Wait, he's with me.

It's okay. I'm not mad at you.
- You're not?

19:33.856 --> 19:36.479
- No. Look, I always think
of you as being so rich

19:36.579 --> 19:38.402
and good-looking that...

19:38.502 --> 19:40.804
I don't think
you can be insecure,

I'm not seeing you.

19:43.988 --> 19:46.531

You know, and you started
making all those girls laugh.

I-I felt like I had to
put you down--

- Oh, okay.

19:54.440 --> 19:56.343

19:56.443 --> 19:59.547
I should've been your wingman
helping you soar to the sun.

19:59.647 --> 20:02.710
Instead, I was blocking out
your light.

20:02.810 --> 20:06.194
- What are you talking about?
Look, it's my fault.

20:06.294 --> 20:07.876
I shouldn't have
treated you like that.

20:07.976 --> 20:10.259
- Come here.
- Oh.

20:11.541 --> 20:12.882
All right.
- Okay, how's he doing?

20:12.982 --> 20:14.284
- Little handsy.

20:14.384 --> 20:15.726
- I just talked
to the waitress,

20:15.826 --> 20:19.731
and she gave Tom an aspirin,
but he thinks he's on drugs.

20:19.831 --> 20:23.255

You're just done with clubs?
