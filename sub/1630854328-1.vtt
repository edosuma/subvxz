02:39.208 --> 02:40.500
What sort of mess

02:40.500 --> 02:42.208
have you gotten yourself
into now, Aelita?

02:42.208 --> 02:44.916
You mean, what sort of mess
have you got me into?

02:47.750 --> 02:49.583
Who would have ever guessed
you'd become the sort of man

02:49.583 --> 02:51.041
who makes
such dangerous friends?

02:53.583 --> 02:56.041
I went for six months
without shoes once.

02:56.125 --> 02:57.291
Remember?

02:57.375 --> 02:59.625
Amazing how
the soles of one's feet

02:59.625 --> 03:02.041
can toughen up or go soft.

03:02.125 --> 03:03.541
Depends on their environment.

03:03.625 --> 03:05.750
Just like the other sort
of soul.

03:08.041 --> 03:10.125
Do you remember
what happened to them?

03:10.125 --> 03:11.333
My shoes?

03:12.833 --> 03:13.833
You gave them to me.

03:16.083 --> 03:18.833
When I first found you,
I made a vow.

03:18.833 --> 03:20.166
That I'd save you if I could.

03:20.250 --> 03:21.083
And you did.

03:22.458 --> 03:23.458
Did I?

03:25.041 --> 03:26.458
What are you up to, Aelita?

03:28.791 --> 03:30.333
Saving a world.

03:30.333 --> 03:31.541
Our world is long past saving.

03:31.625 --> 03:32.875
I thought
that was always your point.

03:32.875 --> 03:35.041
I didn't say "our" world.

03:42.208 --> 03:43.708
Goodbye, Wolf.

03:45.041 --> 03:46.291
Aelita?

03:49.750 --> 03:50.750
Aelita?

05:13.916 --> 05:16.041
- Morning, Mama.
- Mm.

05:16.125 --> 05:17.416
Brought you some coffee.

05:17.500 --> 05:18.958
Just be careful.
It's a little hot.

05:18.958 --> 05:20.166
Ah. Thank you.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.583
There you go.
And I made you a sandwich.

05:21.583 --> 05:23.041
I left it in the fridge.

05:23.125 --> 05:25.750
Burton wants one, he can
go ahead and make his own.

05:25.750 --> 05:26.750
He ate yours yesterday.
And please don't try

05:26.750 --> 05:27.750
to tell me otherwise.

05:27.750 --> 05:29.083
I wasn't hungry.

05:32.291 --> 05:33.833
Can't keep losing weight, Mama.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.291
Go end up
in the hospital again.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.583
Burton!

05:43.583 --> 05:45.375
Shit.

05:54.833 --> 05:56.250
Burton! Open up!

05:56.250 --> 05:58.208
Burton.

06:01.708 --> 06:03.250
Do you care to tell me why

06:03.250 --> 06:05.541
Mama's last Tamosene's
only ten milligrams?

06:05.625 --> 06:06.833
Jump in real quick.
I got to pee.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.833
Uh-uh. Have you been
swapping pills with Mama?

06:08.833 --> 06:10.708
Burton.

06:10.708 --> 06:12.750
Have you been swapping pills
with Mama?

06:12.750 --> 06:15.833
Jesus Christ, Flynne.
You really think I'd do that?

06:15.833 --> 06:17.541
She's got a ten milligram pill.

06:17.625 --> 06:19.416
And just that one, too.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.916
Which means you've likely
not only been swapping

06:22.000 --> 06:23.333
but stealing.

06:23.333 --> 06:25.625
- So I need cash. Now.
- How much?

06:25.625 --> 06:28.291
- How much you got?
- A thousand, if I make it
to the next level.

06:28.375 --> 06:29.625
Which you could
maybe help with.

06:29.625 --> 06:31.041
That's just one pill.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.708
Which is one day, ain't it?

06:32.708 --> 06:35.500
And I got something big
coming tonight.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.000
So we'll have
the rest tomorrow.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.375
All right. Orient me.

06:39.375 --> 06:42.083
Squad of Nazis in the house.
We're in the barn.

06:42.083 --> 06:43.666
Who's "we"?

06:43.750 --> 06:45.625
Me and Reece
and some dude from California.

06:45.625 --> 06:48.291
He hired us
to get him past level 20.

06:48.375 --> 06:49.708
Keeps saying "Chill."

06:49.708 --> 06:51.125
Annoying as all hell.

06:51.125 --> 06:52.750
Reece is the one in the beret.

06:53.791 --> 06:54.875
Hurry up!

06:54.875 --> 06:56.166
I'm late enough as it is.

07:14.291 --> 07:16.166
Whoa, now,
hold it, hold it!

07:20.500 --> 07:21.958
Jesus, don't y'all
even have a shred...

07:21.958 --> 07:23.833
...of decency?

07:23.833 --> 07:25.916
At least let the damn sheep out.

07:35.333 --> 07:37.250
I like your beret, Reece.

07:37.250 --> 07:38.583
Real classy.

07:38.583 --> 07:39.583
Flynne?

07:39.583 --> 07:41.000
<i>Where is Burton?</i>

07:41.000 --> 07:42.083
Powdering his nose.

07:42.083 --> 07:44.041
What are we looking for?

07:44.125 --> 07:45.625
Supposed to be a map.

07:47.000 --> 07:47.875
Did y'all find it?

07:50.750 --> 07:52.041
What are you doing?

07:53.000 --> 07:54.166
Drag that door open, will ya?

08:10.916 --> 08:11.875
I'm back.

08:11.875 --> 08:13.000
Gimme a sec.

08:44.875 --> 08:46.708
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Chill, dude.

08:48.333 --> 08:49.708
You want to guess why
y'all didn't find that map?

08:49.708 --> 08:51.250
Why?

08:51.250 --> 08:52.958
'Cause it hadn't arrived yet.

08:58.166 --> 09:00.333
You can send the money
to my phone.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.000
You're welcome.

09:05.708 --> 09:07.000
Reece!

09:08.458 --> 09:09.375
What the fuck happened?

09:10.583 --> 09:12.666
Flynne happened.

10:11.958 --> 10:13.583
Is it true
that Homeland Security

10:13.583 --> 10:15.250
flags every withdrawal?

10:15.250 --> 10:17.041
Well, that would
make sense, I suppose.

10:17.125 --> 10:18.958
Seems the only time
folks use cash nowadays

10:18.958 --> 10:20.208
is for something funny.

10:20.208 --> 10:22.541
Now, is there a question

10:22.625 --> 10:24.125
hiding in there somewhere,
Tommy?

10:26.125 --> 10:27.541
How's your mama doing, Flynne?

10:27.625 --> 10:29.541
She's okay.

10:29.625 --> 10:31.916
Yeah. Thanks for asking.

10:33.291 --> 10:34.458
What you doing here?

10:34.458 --> 10:36.416
Macon and Edward run afoul
of the law

10:36.500 --> 10:38.416
- at long last?
- Well, not quite yet.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.500
But, uh, give 'em time.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.583
I was just dropping off
an order for Dee Dee.

10:42.583 --> 10:46.000
Printing toppers
for our, uh, wedding cake.

10:49.791 --> 10:51.166
Well...

10:52.166 --> 10:53.583
I should probably go
and help 'em out.

10:54.750 --> 10:56.291
They'll...

10:56.375 --> 10:58.625
definitely mess it up
without some adult oversight.

10:58.625 --> 11:01.625
Well,
Billy Ann is waiting on you.

11:01.625 --> 11:03.125
With some nubbins.

11:03.125 --> 11:04.250
So you're warned.

11:04.250 --> 11:05.625
Thank you.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.041
See ya, Tommy.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.875
<i>You didn't say
anything, did you?</i>

11:16.875 --> 11:18.541
<i>Well, what was
I supposed to say?</i>

11:18.625 --> 11:19.541
<i>How 'bout you go,</i>

11:19.625 --> 11:22.833
<i>"Oh, just trying to imagine</i>

11:22.833 --> 11:25.250
<i>what it must be like
to be you.</i>

11:25.250 --> 11:26.833
Standing there."

11:26.833 --> 11:29.208
Then you go, "But I can't.

11:29.208 --> 11:31.208
You're too damn handsome.

11:31.208 --> 11:33.625
It's like trying
to imagine myself

11:33.625 --> 11:35.750
inside a lion."

11:35.750 --> 11:37.125
Billy, a lion?

11:37.125 --> 11:38.375
Doesn't matter.
Just pick an animal.

11:38.375 --> 11:39.791
And then,

11:39.875 --> 11:41.458
all sultry,

11:41.458 --> 11:43.375
"You value your time?"

11:43.375 --> 11:45.500
And he says, "Sure,"
'cause what else would he say?

11:45.500 --> 11:47.375
And you go, "Well,

11:47.375 --> 11:49.375
why waste these
precious minutes talking..."

11:49.375 --> 11:51.250
Hey, Flynne?
I got Tommy's order here.

11:51.250 --> 11:52.875
"...when we could be pressing

11:52.875 --> 11:54.791
- our sweaty..."
- Oh, my.
- Have you any idea

11:54.875 --> 11:57.041
why they ordered two grooms
and only one bride?

11:57.125 --> 11:58.750
"Howdy, Billy Ann.
Mind if I have a nubbin?"

11:58.750 --> 12:00.375
Uh, maybe 'cause
you misread the form?

12:02.958 --> 12:04.375
Fuck.

12:06.916 --> 12:08.875
All set, then.

12:11.333 --> 12:14.041
"Great to see you, Billy Ann.
Thanks for the nubbins."

12:16.375 --> 12:17.708
I have to say it:

12:17.708 --> 12:19.583
your skills and personality

12:19.583 --> 12:21.500
are being sadly wasted
in this den of imbecility.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.041
<i>Printer 15 jammed.</i>

12:23.125 --> 12:24.333
Especially when you have

12:24.333 --> 12:26.250
a far more lucrative
employment option

12:26.250 --> 12:27.750
at your literal fingertips.

12:27.750 --> 12:30.750
How much does Burton get
jockeying for rich folks?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.166
A whole lot more
than he deserves.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.666
And you could earn
even more.

12:33.750 --> 12:35.250
As long as you use
his avatar, that is,

12:35.250 --> 12:38.000
and they don't realize
it's a girl doing it.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.083
I'm done with that, Billy Ann.
I've already told you that.

12:40.083 --> 12:42.125
Yeah, have indeed.
But not the why of it.

12:42.125 --> 12:44.583
Which would seem like the meat

12:44.583 --> 12:46.708
- of that particular sandwich.
- It ain't real.

12:46.708 --> 12:50.041
Like it or not, this here's
the only world that I got.

12:51.250 --> 12:52.916
Oh.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.166
Well,

12:54.250 --> 12:56.708
on that note...

12:56.708 --> 12:59.083
...before I go make the world
a cleaner place,

12:59.083 --> 13:00.958
I have one last thing
to say about this.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.250
If somebody had been
all puppy-eyed for me

13:04.250 --> 13:05.666
in the lead-up
to my marrying Jasper...

13:07.000 --> 13:09.916
...I would've surely wanted
to know it.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.458
'Cause like you just said,

13:11.458 --> 13:12.666
life goes by real quick.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.291
So...

13:14.375 --> 13:15.916
why waste a minute being timid?

13:17.083 --> 13:18.375
You know that was
a whole lot more

13:18.375 --> 13:19.666
than just one thing, right?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.666
All right.
Have a good day, sweet pea.

13:23.750 --> 13:26.666
Maybe do something bold with it
and make us all proud, huh?

13:26.750 --> 13:28.375
- Bye, Billy Ann.
- Bye.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.875
Hey, ladies.

13:42.250 --> 13:43.375
Fuck.

13:48.375 --> 13:49.958
Oh!

13:51.333 --> 13:53.000
Fuck me.

14:05.083 --> 14:06.916
Mm.

14:11.125 --> 14:12.291
What?

14:16.583 --> 14:18.708
Burton said
to fetch this home.

14:19.750 --> 14:21.416
- What is it?
- Just the coolest fucking thing

14:21.500 --> 14:22.541
we've ever fabbed.

14:22.625 --> 14:24.416
- Mm-hmm.
- And how'd he pay for it?

14:24.500 --> 14:27.000
Didn't. Something called...

14:27.000 --> 14:29.666
"Mi-la-gros Coldiron" did.

14:29.750 --> 14:32.250
Covered our overhead for
the month in the process, too.

14:32.250 --> 14:33.500
And what's it supposed to do?

14:33.500 --> 14:35.583
So, it's some sort
of remote piloting gizmo.

14:35.583 --> 14:38.166
I mean, our best guess,
that is.

14:38.250 --> 14:39.916
Yep. Half the components

14:40.000 --> 14:41.541
don't even have patents yet,
far as we can tell.

14:41.625 --> 14:44.166
It's like mercenary shit,
my bet.

14:44.250 --> 14:45.833
- Where did this come from?
- Mi-la-gros

14:45.833 --> 14:47.791
- Coldiron.
- It's
a Colombian company.

14:47.875 --> 14:49.916
- We looked 'em up.
- Mm-hmm.
- What kind?

14:50.000 --> 14:51.833
Kind that's registered
in Bogotá.

14:51.833 --> 14:53.125
And that's all
they're gonna tell you,

14:53.125 --> 14:54.375
fuck you very much.

14:54.375 --> 14:56.000
Is Burton working for a cartel?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.291
Fuck off.

14:57.375 --> 14:59.541
Now, you two are positive

14:59.625 --> 15:00.666
he ain't paying nothing

15:00.750 --> 15:02.416
- for this?
- Mm-mm. Not a dime.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.458
- You have got to scan for it, though.
- Mm-hmm.

15:05.458 --> 15:06.708
Wait.

15:06.708 --> 15:08.250
Seriously?

15:08.250 --> 15:11.291
Nothing personal. Customer
requested chain of custody.

15:30.958 --> 15:32.958
You want to talk some sense
to me about Mama's pills?

15:40.250 --> 15:41.166
Go on.

15:41.250 --> 15:42.750
I can feel you wanting to.

15:42.750 --> 15:43.833
What?

15:46.833 --> 15:48.583
Ask what this is.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.750
How old do you think I was
the last time that worked on me?

15:52.750 --> 15:55.250
Handing me a toy
to distract me?

15:55.250 --> 15:57.166
Might be surprised.
'Cause when it is working,

15:57.250 --> 15:58.708
you wouldn't
necessarily notice.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.583
That's sort of the whole point.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.916
It looks weird.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.750
What are
all those silver prongs for?

16:15.750 --> 16:17.000
And there's no screen.

16:18.041 --> 16:20.041
Cutting-edge VR, Flynne.

16:20.125 --> 16:21.541
Folks want me to beta test it.

16:21.625 --> 16:23.375
For a shitload of money, too.

16:23.375 --> 16:24.875
Put us in the clear for months.

16:24.875 --> 16:26.791
- Why you?
- Turns out I'm one

16:26.875 --> 16:28.583
of the few jockeys
ever to reach the 100th level

16:28.583 --> 16:29.958
- in <i>Halcyon.</i>
- Come on.

16:29.958 --> 16:31.208
You never made it
past level 83,

16:31.208 --> 16:32.583
- the fire caves.
- True enough.

16:32.583 --> 16:34.958
But someone else was using
my avatar, apparently.

16:34.958 --> 16:36.708
Playing as Easy Ice.

16:36.708 --> 16:40.583
And she got herself
all the way to level 107.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.375
Uh-uh. No, Burton.

16:42.375 --> 16:44.000
I don't have time
for this shit.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.583
- I got to put dinner on...
- This here's the only way

16:45.583 --> 16:48.291
we're gonna pay
for Mama's Tamosene.

16:52.375 --> 16:54.291
Come on. You know
I'm proud of you, right?

16:54.375 --> 16:55.750
- How good you are at this?
- Oh, shut up.

16:55.750 --> 16:56.916
You are so full of shit.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
I can't see how you
stand yourself sometimes.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.083
I know.

17:00.083 --> 17:02.500
But it's true.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.291
I am proud of you.

17:14.625 --> 17:16.125
They pay by level?

17:16.125 --> 17:17.708
Time on the clock, straight up.

17:17.708 --> 17:19.833
Longer you're in,
the more you earn.

17:19.833 --> 17:21.750
Like I said,
working out the kinks.

17:24.708 --> 17:26.333
What do they want?

17:27.791 --> 17:29.333
Killer?

17:29.333 --> 17:31.041
Achiever and explorer.

17:31.125 --> 17:32.666
Your fortes.

17:36.500 --> 17:39.375
Do I get another big-ass beard
this time or what?

17:40.375 --> 17:41.625
Far as I can tell,

17:41.625 --> 17:42.791
you're gonna be
a version of me.

17:42.875 --> 17:44.541
Okay.

17:44.625 --> 17:47.250
Then I should probably just act
a little dimwitted, then.

17:51.166 --> 17:52.083
I just put it on?

17:52.083 --> 17:53.458
Mm-hmm.

18:04.375 --> 18:05.708
Lay back.

18:05.708 --> 18:06.875
Close your eyes.

18:06.875 --> 18:08.166
Stop it.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.083
Count back from ten.

18:11.083 --> 18:13.708
The rest should be
self-explanatory,

18:13.708 --> 18:15.250
- more or less.
- Okay.

18:23.708 --> 18:25.708
Six. Five.

18:25.708 --> 18:28.208
Four. Three.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.791
Two. One.

18:32.208 --> 18:33.750
Burton, this is not working.

18:35.833 --> 18:37.541
Whoa!

18:39.708 --> 18:42.583
Holy shit!

19:07.416 --> 19:09.000
<i>Well, hello.</i>

19:10.500 --> 19:12.000
<i>Welcome to the Sim, Easy Ice.</i>

19:20.416 --> 19:22.166
<i>Is this like your other sims?</i>

19:22.250 --> 19:24.666
No. No fucking way.

19:24.750 --> 19:26.041
I can feel things.

19:26.125 --> 19:27.625
Everything.

19:31.083 --> 19:32.083
<i>Pain, too.</i>

19:32.083 --> 19:34.083
<i>So you've been warned.</i>

19:36.458 --> 19:37.750
Who are you?

19:37.750 --> 19:39.166
<i>The voice in your head.</i>

19:39.250 --> 19:42.208
<i>I tell you what to do
and you do it.</i>

19:42.208 --> 19:44.041
<i>That's how you earn your keep.</i>

20:16.583 --> 20:18.166
<i>Left.</i>

20:26.250 --> 20:28.166
<i>Your destination.</i>

20:28.250 --> 20:31.041
I think I know what that is.

20:31.125 --> 20:33.333
<i>No, you know
what it used to be.</i>

20:36.375 --> 20:37.791
<i>Halfway around the circle.</i>

20:39.250 --> 20:40.541
<i>Keep going.</i>

20:41.541 --> 20:43.208
<i>Around the corner.</i>

20:44.875 --> 20:46.958
<i>And pull up
at the door on the left.</i>

20:52.583 --> 20:54.583
<i>You're on foot from here.</i>

21:03.916 --> 21:05.583
I need a weapon?

21:05.583 --> 21:07.458
<i>Just the rapier of your wit,</i>

21:07.458 --> 21:08.875
<i>should you possess
such a thing.</i>

21:08.875 --> 21:10.041
<i>Let's look lively now.</i>

21:10.125 --> 21:11.666
<i>Someone's waiting.</i>

21:23.166 --> 21:26.250
<i>Say "I've arrived."</i>

21:26.250 --> 21:27.708
I've arrived.

21:42.375 --> 21:44.625
You don't appear to be
in our database.

21:44.625 --> 21:46.041
Your name is?

21:46.125 --> 21:48.125
Easy Ice.

21:48.125 --> 21:49.458
And do you prefer "Easy"?

21:49.458 --> 21:50.958
Or "Mr. Ice"?

21:50.958 --> 21:53.291
"Mr. Ice" has
a pretty good ring to it.

21:53.375 --> 21:55.541
Registered, Mr. Ice.

21:55.625 --> 21:58.375
Enjoy the party, Mr. Ice.

22:46.166 --> 22:47.916
Where is everybody?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
<i>In the garden, dear.</i>

22:53.500 --> 22:55.041
What
is this?

22:55.125 --> 22:56.708
<i>A company party.</i>

22:56.708 --> 22:58.916
Somebody made a sim
about a company party

22:59.000 --> 23:00.333
at Buckingham Palace?

23:00.333 --> 23:02.166
<i>There's the wit
I was hoping for.</i>

23:02.250 --> 23:03.458
What's the company?

23:03.458 --> 23:05.541
<i>A little venture called
the R.I.</i>

23:05.625 --> 23:06.666
<i>Which stands for...?</i>

23:06.750 --> 23:08.583
<i>Research Institute.</i>

23:08.583 --> 23:10.333
<i>Or Rebirth and Innovation.</i>

23:10.333 --> 23:11.333
<i>Or Radically Immoral.</i>

23:11.333 --> 23:13.708
<i>Depending upon whom you ask.</i>

23:13.708 --> 23:16.375
<i>This is their annual
self-congratulatory</i>

23:16.375 --> 23:17.708
<i>pat on the shoulder.</i>

23:17.708 --> 23:19.333
<i>A high point
of the social calendar,</i>

23:19.333 --> 23:21.250
<i>I assure you.
Not to be missed.</i>

23:21.250 --> 23:23.583
<i>Head inside, please.</i>

23:30.416 --> 23:32.750
Enjoying yourself, Mr. Ice?

23:36.583 --> 23:37.916
<i>♪ From this day forward...</i>

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
<i>Now,
shall we play a little game?</i>

23:42.291 --> 23:43.875
<i>Mirror, mirror on the wall.</i>

23:43.875 --> 23:46.458
<i>Who's the prettiest
of 'em all?</i>

23:50.250 --> 23:51.833
<i>Oh, dear. No, no, no, no, no.</i>

23:51.833 --> 23:54.833
<i>That's the queen bee
of this entire vile hive.</i>

23:54.833 --> 23:56.625
<i>You don't want to feel
her sting, trust me.</i>

24:02.333 --> 24:04.416
<i>That's better.</i>

24:04.500 --> 24:07.458
<i>Warmer. Warmer.</i>

24:07.458 --> 24:09.250
<i>Warmer still.</i>

24:11.250 --> 24:12.833
<i>Your crown of laurels.</i>

24:14.541 --> 24:16.166
<i>Now approach her, please.</i>

24:17.166 --> 24:20.750
<i>I need you to convince this
young woman to take you home.</i>

24:21.875 --> 24:23.791
<i>Don't tell me you're shy.</i>

24:25.625 --> 24:28.625
<i>Make this happen now
or you won't be paid.</i>

24:36.583 --> 24:38.416
It's flattering at first,
you know.

24:38.500 --> 24:40.416
But if you stare too long,

24:40.500 --> 24:41.958
it starts to feel a tad dodgy.

24:41.958 --> 24:43.375
And...

24:43.375 --> 24:45.458
you are about
to cross that line.

24:45.458 --> 24:48.833
I was just trying to imagine
what it must be like.

24:48.833 --> 24:50.791
To be you.

24:52.666 --> 24:54.666
Sitting here like this.

24:54.750 --> 24:56.166
And?

24:57.750 --> 24:58.833
I can't.

25:00.208 --> 25:01.791
You're just too beautiful.

25:03.416 --> 25:07.041
It's like trying
to imagine myself inside a...

25:07.125 --> 25:08.041
swan.

25:14.416 --> 25:15.333
Come.

25:15.333 --> 25:16.916
Sit.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.500
Be a king to my queen.

25:31.083 --> 25:33.833
I'm Mariel. And you are?

25:37.125 --> 25:39.625
Do you value your time, Mariel?

25:41.000 --> 25:42.875
Well, as much as anyone. Why?

25:42.875 --> 25:45.083
I could
introduce myself

25:45.083 --> 25:49.208
and then spend
the next hour leaning close,

25:49.208 --> 25:52.041
complimenting you.

25:52.125 --> 25:53.666
And then, maybe,

25:53.750 --> 25:55.666
if the signs seemed right,

25:55.750 --> 25:57.625
I could ask you
to take me home.

26:03.250 --> 26:04.166
Or?

26:04.250 --> 26:05.666
I could ask you now.

26:28.708 --> 26:31.125
<i>Your new friend
has rather affected tastes.</i>

26:31.125 --> 26:33.625
<i>Her car requires a driver.</i>

26:40.458 --> 26:42.458
<i>Should you try to harm Mariel,</i>

26:42.458 --> 26:45.250
<i>this creature is programmed
to kill you, all right?</i>

27:20.000 --> 27:22.833
<i>In your pocket,
you'll find a glass ampoule.</i>

27:24.041 --> 27:25.708
<i>You're gonna snap this open,</i>

27:25.708 --> 27:27.958
<i>hold it under
Mariel's pretty nose,</i>

27:27.958 --> 27:30.583
<i>and while you do this,
I'd suggest you attend</i>

27:30.583 --> 27:32.791
<i>rather closely
to your surroundings.</i>

28:56.125 --> 28:58.125
<i>Chop, chop.
Let's keep this moving.</i>

29:01.375 --> 29:03.208
<i>Look at her.</i>

29:07.125 --> 29:08.958
<i>I speak,</i>

29:08.958 --> 29:11.958
<i>and I'm like a thought
for you, aren't I?</i>

29:11.958 --> 29:13.000
<i>Left.</i>

29:15.000 --> 29:17.166
<i>Such power.</i>

29:17.250 --> 29:19.041
<i>I didn't realize I'd enjoy it</i>

29:19.125 --> 29:20.375
<i>quite so much.</i>

29:20.375 --> 29:22.208
<i>Planting words in your head,</i>

29:22.208 --> 29:24.875
<i>like so many seeds
in fertile soil.</i>

29:24.875 --> 29:26.708
<i>Left.</i>

29:27.708 --> 29:30.333
<i>When there were need
of the creation of the sun,</i>

29:30.333 --> 29:32.875
<i>the Moon, the planets,
and the Earth,</i>

29:32.875 --> 29:34.500
<i>there was only darkness,</i>

29:34.500 --> 29:38.166
<i>and everything was created
from the darkness.</i>

29:38.250 --> 29:40.250
<i>On your right, pull in.</i>

29:51.666 --> 29:53.125
<i>So...</i>

29:54.291 --> 29:56.375
<i>Show us what you've learned.</i>

29:57.416 --> 29:58.458
I've arrived.

30:06.833 --> 30:08.291
Who's this?

30:08.375 --> 30:10.625
Your master,
little puppet.

30:25.333 --> 30:27.333
The one who pulls your strings.

30:31.458 --> 30:32.458
What?

30:34.666 --> 30:36.833
You're my first polt.
I'm not gonna lie, it's...

30:36.833 --> 30:38.458
bit of an odd feeling.

30:38.458 --> 30:40.083
What's a polt?

30:40.083 --> 30:41.625
You see, I know
that you're real,

30:41.625 --> 30:43.250
and yet...

30:43.250 --> 30:46.041
Still, it's just all a bit
hard to fathom.

30:48.208 --> 30:50.958
If I assured you that
you'd likely no longer exist

30:50.958 --> 30:53.208
in, like, another decade,

30:53.208 --> 30:54.500
what would that mean to you?

30:54.500 --> 30:58.083
No, it's true. Ten years.

30:58.083 --> 30:59.625
Would that carry any weight?

30:59.625 --> 31:02.375
Would you wake from here
and change your life?

31:04.625 --> 31:06.125
You were easier to follow

31:06.125 --> 31:08.041
when you were just
a voice inside my head.

31:08.083 --> 31:09.541
Mm.

31:13.833 --> 31:15.208
Now what?

31:15.208 --> 31:17.833
Something rather eye-opening,
I assure you.

31:20.958 --> 31:23.291
Let's resume this tomorrow,
shall we?

31:31.166 --> 31:34.041
Well, you gonna say something,
or just lie there?

31:35.416 --> 31:37.208
Holy shit.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.583
Holy shit. It was

31:41.583 --> 31:42.958
like being there.

31:44.458 --> 31:46.250
Like I was actually
in your body.

31:46.250 --> 31:48.041
Felt like an upgrade, I bet.

31:48.125 --> 31:50.708
No, it felt fucking weird
is what it felt like.

31:51.708 --> 31:53.666
What's the sim about?

31:53.750 --> 31:55.625
A kidnapping.

31:55.625 --> 31:57.250
But, I mean, that's definitely
just the start.

31:57.250 --> 31:58.375
Well, you must've done
something right

31:58.375 --> 31:59.708
because they want you
back tomorrow,

31:59.708 --> 32:01.791
- and they just bumped up
the money.
- No shit.

32:01.875 --> 32:04.250
Look, I don't want to be
an asshole about this, Flynne,

32:04.250 --> 32:06.333
but we're talking
a lot of fucking cash here.

32:06.333 --> 32:08.833
Like, enough to set us right
for months.

32:08.833 --> 32:09.958
I hear you.

32:09.958 --> 32:12.000
And?

32:12.000 --> 32:13.875
There's no need to argue.

32:13.875 --> 32:15.666
- It's that good, huh?
- Hell, if you had any idea,

32:15.750 --> 32:18.250
you'd for sure want
to take over yourself.

32:19.625 --> 32:21.916
Wh-Wh-Whoa. Hold up.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
- You good?
- Yeah.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.416
Is that thing safe?

32:25.500 --> 32:27.625
Bit late to ask now,

32:27.625 --> 32:29.500
don't you think?

32:29.500 --> 32:31.333
How's it work?

32:31.333 --> 32:33.583
I don't know. Some sort
of neural cutout, I guess.

32:33.583 --> 32:35.458
Like my haptics.

32:35.458 --> 32:37.791
Ah, fuck. Well, that
ended up pretty well, huh?

32:37.875 --> 32:39.875
Just wait here till it passes.
You'll be fine.

32:39.875 --> 32:41.500
I'll ride over to Jimmy's

32:41.500 --> 32:43.208
and pick up the rest
of Mama's Tamosene.

32:43.208 --> 32:45.875
Nah, I got it, Burton.

32:45.875 --> 32:48.000
I could use some fresh air.

32:56.583 --> 32:58.000
Sorry, Conner.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
I've been told to cut you off.

33:42.541 --> 33:43.791
I need Tamosene.

33:54.416 --> 33:56.416
Think you might need a little
bit of help with your math

33:56.500 --> 33:57.708
here, Flynne.

33:57.708 --> 33:59.583
I just want the one pill.

33:59.583 --> 34:01.833
I'll come back here tomorrow
and pick up the rest.

34:01.833 --> 34:03.541
You know that's not
how this works.

34:08.208 --> 34:10.125
Y'all shut the fuck up.

34:12.833 --> 34:14.750
Now,
unless you want to,

34:14.750 --> 34:16.500
uh...

34:16.500 --> 34:19.250
I don't know, figure out

34:19.250 --> 34:20.750
some sort of barter deal?

34:20.750 --> 34:24.500
You know,
render us both a service?

34:24.500 --> 34:25.666
Atticus,

34:25.750 --> 34:27.416
give me the goddamn pill.

34:27.500 --> 34:30.375
Maybe you should try
your luck at Pharma Jon.

34:30.375 --> 34:31.583
See if they're a little more...

34:33.000 --> 34:34.166
...amenable.

34:45.041 --> 34:46.708
Gentlemen.

34:48.208 --> 34:49.458
How about you just give

34:49.458 --> 34:50.958
the young lady
what she asking for?

34:50.958 --> 34:52.083
I would've guessed

34:52.083 --> 34:54.375
a one-armed dude
would know when it's time

34:54.375 --> 34:56.291
to mind his own business.

34:56.375 --> 34:57.583
Want to know
the best part

34:57.583 --> 34:59.666
about being
a one-armed dude, Cash?

34:59.750 --> 35:01.958
No more clapping?

35:01.958 --> 35:04.666
You ain't got

35:04.750 --> 35:06.583
a lot left to lose, bruh.

35:11.791 --> 35:13.750
Walk away.

35:14.916 --> 35:18.625
Why? Are you worried
about your boyfriend?

35:18.625 --> 35:20.833
I'm worried about you.

35:24.750 --> 35:27.875
You see,
in a situation like this?

35:27.875 --> 35:31.791
Now, let's say I decide
to reach for that

35:31.875 --> 35:33.958
bull pup there.

35:35.833 --> 35:38.250
Now, what's the worst thing
that can happen to me?

35:39.708 --> 35:41.583
As far as I can figure,

35:43.125 --> 35:44.708
the worst thing,

35:44.708 --> 35:47.375
and I mean
the very fucking worst...

35:49.458 --> 35:53.125
...is that I only
manage to kill two of you,

35:53.125 --> 35:55.250
rather than all three.

36:34.541 --> 36:36.666
They should've
finished the job, Conner.

36:36.750 --> 36:39.041
Killed you outright.

36:39.125 --> 36:41.250
Done us all a service.

36:43.083 --> 36:45.666
Yeah. Trust me, Cash.

36:47.208 --> 36:49.875
I had the same thought,
many a morning.

36:51.041 --> 36:52.916
<i>Yeah ♪</i>

36:53.000 --> 36:55.916
<i>Yeah, I walk all day ♪</i>

36:57.500 --> 37:01.416
<i>I walk all night, yeah ♪</i>

37:01.500 --> 37:04.333
<i>Walk all day ♪</i>

37:04.333 --> 37:07.083
<i>♪ Just to see you, baby...</i>

37:13.208 --> 37:15.125
<i>Gonna rob
a bank tomorrow?</i>

37:15.125 --> 37:16.791
<i>Nah, Burton has
something he scrounged up.</i>

37:18.250 --> 37:20.291
Knowing him as I do,
that sounds a tad worrisome.

37:20.375 --> 37:21.750
Mm-hmm.

37:21.750 --> 37:22.875
How's he holding up?

37:24.083 --> 37:26.291
You should come by sometime.

37:26.375 --> 37:28.958
See for yourself. He might even

37:28.958 --> 37:30.958
be moved enough
to offer you a beer.

37:30.958 --> 37:32.125
Just the one?

37:33.333 --> 37:35.166
Well, I guess it depends
on how generous

37:35.250 --> 37:36.666
he's feeling.

37:36.750 --> 37:39.166
How's the charge on that?

37:39.250 --> 37:42.125
Low.

37:42.125 --> 37:44.791
Burton never pedals
like he ought to.

37:44.875 --> 37:47.208
Those words could end up
on his gravestone one day,

37:47.208 --> 37:48.208
don't you think?

37:48.208 --> 37:50.500
Definitely, yeah.

37:50.500 --> 37:52.958
Want some help with it?

38:21.291 --> 38:22.916
See you around, Conner.

38:26.625 --> 38:28.291
<i>I think a quick
performance review</i>

38:28.375 --> 38:30.291
might be in order,

38:30.375 --> 38:32.500
don't you?

38:32.500 --> 38:35.500
Some constructive criticism?

38:36.708 --> 38:38.958
I-I could understand
how you might be

38:38.958 --> 38:41.250
unhappy with us, Mr. Pickett.

38:41.250 --> 38:43.000
Gonna hit the john real quick.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.750
Sit down, Jasper.

38:50.666 --> 38:52.666
I'm not unhappy.

38:54.708 --> 38:57.500
Just confused.

38:57.500 --> 39:00.500
If you'd decided to sell
that young woman one pill,

39:00.500 --> 39:04.125
I might be inclined to trust
you made a judgment call.

39:04.125 --> 39:06.458
I might even respect it.

39:06.458 --> 39:08.208
Betraying, as it would,

39:08.208 --> 39:11.000
an unexpected level
of improvisational thinking.

39:14.208 --> 39:15.416
But...

39:17.250 --> 39:20.708
...it's the bullying
that gives me pause.

39:22.416 --> 39:24.708
Bullying?

39:26.208 --> 39:27.916
Well, what would you call it?

39:28.000 --> 39:31.541
The way that drunk cripple
manhandled you out there?

39:39.875 --> 39:41.916
Drink up, son.

39:44.041 --> 39:45.750
I need you calm,

39:45.750 --> 39:48.708
so you can absorb this lesson.

40:07.708 --> 40:09.750
When you look weak,

40:09.750 --> 40:11.583
I look weak.

40:11.583 --> 40:13.250
Understand?

40:14.500 --> 40:16.541
Good boy.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.916
Take him to
the restroom, Jasper.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.166
Get him cleaned up.

42:11.541 --> 42:13.416
Something wrong, hon?

42:19.000 --> 42:21.958
No, ma'am. Just the sorry state
of your hair.

42:21.958 --> 42:24.458
But don't worry, I'll ask
Billy Ann to come over

42:24.458 --> 42:26.416
and give this briar patch
a little trim.

42:26.500 --> 42:29.041
That'd be nice.

42:29.125 --> 42:31.833
She tells me all the news
you're too proper to share.

42:31.833 --> 42:33.958
Are you trying to call
Billy Ann a gossip?

42:33.958 --> 42:36.125
I'm saying she knows how
to entertain

42:36.125 --> 42:37.708
an old shut-in like me.

42:37.708 --> 42:41.083
Is her Jasper still mixed up
with his Uncle Corbell?

42:41.083 --> 42:43.541
Mama, please tell me

42:43.625 --> 42:45.416
that you do not ask her that.

42:45.500 --> 42:47.750
If I was her best friend,
I might.

42:49.208 --> 42:52.041
So, how's the pain been?

42:53.458 --> 42:56.250
Oh... you know.

42:58.083 --> 42:59.000
I don't.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.500
That's precisely why I'm asking.

43:01.500 --> 43:03.750
Well, Burton's been
giving me his extra pills.

43:03.750 --> 43:05.083
That's helped some.

43:10.208 --> 43:12.041
What do you mean?

43:12.125 --> 43:14.875
Well, he says he doesn't
need them so much anymore.

43:16.333 --> 43:18.541
They help tide me through
the rough patches.

43:33.666 --> 43:35.250
<i>How are those
haptics treating you?</i>

43:35.250 --> 43:36.333
<i>Been worse.</i>

43:40.458 --> 43:42.500
I saw you last night.

43:42.500 --> 43:43.916
Through the window.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.625
Appreciate the beers.

43:45.625 --> 43:47.750
Could've been colder, though.

43:47.750 --> 43:49.958
Beggars and choosers, Burton.

43:55.375 --> 43:57.041
I'm sorry I said
all that evil stuff

43:57.125 --> 43:58.750
about you taking Mama's pills.

44:02.958 --> 44:05.791
Hey, you know
if you ever want to talk,

44:05.875 --> 44:07.000
I'm all ears.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.500
About what?

44:08.500 --> 44:10.708
You know, the pain.

44:10.708 --> 44:12.750
What's going on, Flynne?

44:12.750 --> 44:15.416
What do you mean?

44:15.500 --> 44:16.958
You're acting fucking weird.

44:16.958 --> 44:19.958
Yeah? Well, just give me that.
Stop piddlin' with it.

44:23.666 --> 44:26.958
I promise not to tell anyone,
but you almost look happy there.

44:29.208 --> 44:31.666
Makes me want to take a photo.

44:31.750 --> 44:34.208
Record the event
for posterity's sake.

44:34.208 --> 44:36.125
Fuck off.

44:37.958 --> 44:40.375
Just don't let Milagros Coldiron
catch you smiling like that.

44:40.375 --> 44:42.791
They might start charging us,
rather than paying.

44:42.875 --> 44:45.958
They got a good thing going
here, Burton. I'm telling you.

44:45.958 --> 44:48.208
It's gonna be huge.

44:48.208 --> 44:49.458
Well, enjoy it while you can.

44:50.708 --> 44:52.083
I intend to.

44:52.083 --> 44:54.875
Don't you worry about that.

45:09.375 --> 45:11.500
Six. Five.

45:11.541 --> 45:13.791
Four. Three.

45:13.875 --> 45:16.708
Two. One.

45:32.458 --> 45:34.625
I assume you're wondering
why you can't move.

45:34.625 --> 45:38.125
And that's
a very good question.

45:38.125 --> 45:41.041
Which leads to
another question, I know.

45:41.125 --> 45:44.000
Why would I do such a thing?

45:44.000 --> 45:46.291
Do you know

45:46.375 --> 45:48.291
what "enucleation" means?

45:48.333 --> 45:49.833
Hmm?

45:51.166 --> 45:52.166
Now, I imagine that you've begun

45:52.250 --> 45:53.833
to shout in your head,
haven't you?

45:53.833 --> 45:55.625
"End game! Disconnect!"

45:56.666 --> 45:58.750
Alas, you can't
do that here, 'cause

45:58.750 --> 46:01.000
I initiated the connection,
and only I can end it, so...

46:03.708 --> 46:05.041
Oh, look.

46:05.125 --> 46:06.958
That's Mariel's
beautiful blue orb.

46:06.958 --> 46:09.375
Soon to be yours.

46:09.375 --> 46:10.833
Okay,

46:10.833 --> 46:12.291
I suppose that this

46:12.375 --> 46:14.500
may all seem
a little bit sadistic.

46:14.500 --> 46:16.791
Me not putting you under
and all that, but

46:16.875 --> 46:19.166
I assure you,
it's for a very noble cause,

46:19.250 --> 46:21.500
all right? Look,

46:21.500 --> 46:24.250
I may need you

46:24.250 --> 46:26.750
to endure terrible pain
in the coming hours,

46:26.750 --> 46:28.333
okay? So try

46:28.333 --> 46:31.208
and see this as
a sort of little test.

46:31.208 --> 46:34.416
I mean, you're not actually
in this body, are you?

46:41.625 --> 46:43.583
Can you hear your heart?

46:43.583 --> 46:45.000
It's like a frightened horse,

46:45.000 --> 46:46.458
trapped in a burning barn.

46:54.041 --> 46:55.666
But none of this is real, is it?

46:57.375 --> 46:59.000
<i>I need you
to discipline your mind.</i>

46:59.000 --> 47:00.916
Convince it that this is

47:01.000 --> 47:02.208
<i>all imaginary.</i>

47:03.750 --> 47:05.791
<i>Your heart.</i>

47:05.875 --> 47:07.125
Show me that you can rein it in.

47:23.708 --> 47:24.916
Well done.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Very well done.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.416
I think you've earned yourself
a little shut-eye,

47:29.500 --> 47:31.125
so to speak, don't you?

47:51.250 --> 47:52.500
Back, are we?

47:54.500 --> 47:56.875
And look how pretty you are.

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
Ah-ah, ah-ah. Best not.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.750
Doctor's orders.

48:05.750 --> 48:06.791
What are we doing?

48:06.875 --> 48:09.208
You're going to be a love,

48:09.208 --> 48:11.541
and open some doors for me.

48:28.416 --> 48:31.416
Press your eye to it,
or rather dear Mariel's.

49:18.625 --> 49:20.416
What is this place?

49:20.500 --> 49:23.833
"Infinity in the palm
of your hand.

49:23.833 --> 49:27.041
Eternity in an hour."

50:08.333 --> 50:09.958
It's a great gift
I'm giving you.

50:09.958 --> 50:11.583
I hope you're worthy of it.

50:38.791 --> 50:40.041
Are you ready?

50:40.125 --> 50:42.166
For what?

50:42.250 --> 50:44.666
To lay claim to your destiny.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.833
Your eye.

50:56.291 --> 50:57.916
The other one.

51:16.375 --> 51:17.958
Master it.

51:20.916 --> 51:22.750
Ooh.

51:27.791 --> 51:29.583
Stop him.

51:30.791 --> 51:32.125
Now. He's here to kill us.

51:54.375 --> 51:56.750
Aelita West.

51:56.750 --> 51:59.875
Grains and Legumes.

52:06.166 --> 52:08.750
Have you encountered
one of these before?

52:08.750 --> 52:11.791
It's a clever little device.

52:11.875 --> 52:13.708
Delivers a sonic punch.

52:13.708 --> 52:15.500
Right down into the organs.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.250
Now, I've never felt it myself,

52:19.250 --> 52:22.083
but what I've observed,
it's rather effective.

52:22.083 --> 52:24.291
Who else is involved?

52:24.375 --> 52:26.166
Fuck you.

52:26.250 --> 52:28.000
Is this the liver over here?

52:29.458 --> 52:31.625
Or is it the spleen?

52:34.041 --> 52:36.208
I really should brush up
on my anatomy.

52:36.208 --> 52:38.000
But I know where the brain is.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.416
And guess what happens then?

52:39.500 --> 52:42.333
Names, Ms. West.

52:52.250 --> 52:53.375
Who else
is helping you?

52:55.083 --> 52:57.916
Help? I fucking wish.

52:58.833 --> 53:00.125
Run!

53:05.208 --> 53:06.750
Easy Ice, eh?

53:06.750 --> 53:09.083
Brilliant.

53:09.083 --> 53:10.750
What's your real name, lad?

53:10.750 --> 53:14.333
Once we cut this
bloody thing's head off,

53:14.333 --> 53:16.125
we can easily trace
your connection.

53:16.125 --> 53:19.416
So why draw it out?

53:19.500 --> 53:21.375
Who are you?

53:21.375 --> 53:22.833
Where are you?

54:04.375 --> 54:06.541
What happened?

54:08.708 --> 54:10.750
- Never again.
- What...

54:10.750 --> 54:12.333
Never fucking again.

54:13.750 --> 54:15.083
Flynne!

54:22.291 --> 54:24.666
Flynne
Harlene Fisher.

54:24.750 --> 54:25.916
I've been waiting out

54:26.000 --> 54:27.291
in Jasper's truck,
thinking you were tied up

54:27.375 --> 54:28.458
tending to your mama.

54:28.458 --> 54:30.208
Finally, I decided
I ought to come in

54:30.208 --> 54:31.541
and lend a hand,

54:31.625 --> 54:33.583
being such a conscientious
friend and all,

54:33.583 --> 54:35.083
and look what I find.

54:35.083 --> 54:37.791
- Shake a leg, princess.
- Mm-mm.

54:37.875 --> 54:40.666
- I'm calling in sick.
- What's wrong?

54:40.750 --> 54:43.666
- Everything.
- Know what
déjà vu means

54:43.750 --> 54:46.500
if you translate it,
like, literally?

54:46.500 --> 54:48.250
"Already seen."

54:48.250 --> 54:51.500
As in, we both already seen
how this sort of funk

54:51.500 --> 54:54.500
plays out
'cause we been here before.

54:54.500 --> 54:56.541
This exact same moment,
so come on,

54:56.625 --> 54:58.083
get some clothes on.

55:02.625 --> 55:03.708
You didn't.

55:03.708 --> 55:05.708
Billy Ann, drop it.

55:05.708 --> 55:07.041
Billy Ann, give it back.

55:07.125 --> 55:08.375
- You dirty, dirty girl.
- Give it back.

55:08.375 --> 55:10.541
Billy Ann, give me the figurine.

55:11.541 --> 55:12.916
Stop.

55:18.500 --> 55:20.583
Think I might've missed
an episode or two here.

55:20.583 --> 55:22.291
- Mind catching me up?
- Just go.

55:22.375 --> 55:23.875
All right?
Jasper's waiting on you.

55:23.875 --> 55:25.500
And he'll
keep at it, too.

55:25.500 --> 55:27.833
Which is one of his finer
qualities, if I'm being honest.

55:31.500 --> 55:33.791
What? Is this about Tommy?

55:35.583 --> 55:38.291
- That's just so stupid.
- What's so stupid about it?

55:38.375 --> 55:40.375
It's a seventh-grade crush
I didn't have any good sense

55:40.375 --> 55:42.208
to give up on. That's what.

55:42.208 --> 55:44.250
- Act on, you mean.
- Come on, Billy Ann.

55:44.250 --> 55:45.375
It ain't gonna happen.

55:45.375 --> 55:47.333
You know that.

55:55.083 --> 55:56.833
You know, I've been
playing this sim,

55:56.833 --> 55:59.375
filling in for Burton.
Mean, it's

55:59.375 --> 56:02.416
new tech, best I've ever seen.

56:02.500 --> 56:05.916
It's like you're...
actually there.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.041
You can feel your whole body,

56:08.125 --> 56:10.541
- like it's real or something.
- Hmm.

56:10.625 --> 56:13.166
Then, you know,
just 'cause people want to go

56:13.250 --> 56:15.625
and make things nasty,

56:15.625 --> 56:17.416
it turned.

56:18.708 --> 56:19.875
They cut my eye out.

56:19.875 --> 56:21.625
- Mm-mm.
- Beat me to death,

56:21.625 --> 56:22.875
for no reason at all.

56:22.875 --> 56:24.958
It was just meanness,

56:24.958 --> 56:26.833
plain and simple.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.666
I'm sorry, sweet pea.

56:29.750 --> 56:32.500
Yeah, but you know, the thing
that I keep thinking on...

56:32.500 --> 56:34.625
The palm of my hand
got ripped off, right?

56:34.625 --> 56:36.083
Oh, Jesus.

56:36.083 --> 56:37.666
Yeah, but underneath it,
it was...

56:39.250 --> 56:40.750
...it was a machine.

56:42.458 --> 56:44.166
Why would they design it
like that?

56:44.250 --> 56:46.833
- Why not?
- 'Cause it seems to me like

56:46.833 --> 56:49.166
the whole thing they're gonna
be selling this sim on,

56:49.250 --> 56:52.958
what's most important about it,
is that everything feels real.

56:52.958 --> 56:55.833
So why go and put machine
underneath it?

56:55.833 --> 56:57.750
Why not just use
an actual human hand?

56:57.750 --> 57:00.000
I don't think I'm following.

57:02.375 --> 57:03.791
I'm just being stupid.

57:05.958 --> 57:07.291
I know that look
you get, Flynne.

57:08.541 --> 57:10.250
Might mean a lot
of different things,

57:10.250 --> 57:12.125
but stupid ain't one.

57:18.375 --> 57:20.708
Fuck it. Then here it is.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.916
I can't help but think
that I was...

57:28.000 --> 57:29.500
actually there.

57:31.083 --> 57:34.958
In a real body,
somewhere that's... real.

57:37.166 --> 57:39.208
Not just in an another sim.

57:53.166 --> 57:55.166
<i>Ms. Fisher,</i>

57:55.250 --> 57:56.791
<i>I need you to listen
very closely.</i>

57:56.875 --> 57:58.833
You're in grave danger.

57:58.833 --> 58:00.291
Everything you believe
about your experience

58:00.375 --> 58:01.625
with the headset is wrong.

58:01.625 --> 58:04.208
<i>Everything. The situation
is far more complex</i>

58:04.208 --> 58:06.125
<i>and far more perilous
than you can possibly imagine.</i>

58:06.125 --> 58:09.416
It's crucial that you log back
into the sim. Immediately.

58:09.500 --> 58:11.875
- How'd you get this number?
- Ms. Fisher?

58:11.875 --> 58:13.708
I asked you a question.

58:13.708 --> 58:14.791
Finding your number
has honestly been

58:14.875 --> 58:16.291
the least challenging
of my tasks.

58:16.375 --> 58:18.083
- Well, don't call it again.
- <i>Your life is at risk.</i>

58:19.833 --> 58:21.750
Fuck.

58:27.166 --> 58:28.458
<i>...Atlanta
couple had</i>

58:28.458 --> 58:30.375
<i>two servings
of bad luck yesterday,</i>

58:30.375 --> 58:32.208
<i>when a bee flew in</i>

58:32.208 --> 58:34.333
<i>their car window.
The driver...</i>

58:34.333 --> 58:37.541
<i>...in a panic,
sending the car swerving</i>

58:37.625 --> 58:39.625
<i>into a tree...</i>

58:39.625 --> 58:42.291
<i>...the driver was unconscious...</i>

58:42.375 --> 58:44.625
<i>so police were called
to the scene.</i>

59:58.458 --> 1:00:00.416
- Step into the road, please.
- Why?

1:00:00.500 --> 1:00:02.083
I'm gonna shoot you
if you don't.

1:01:02.958 --> 1:01:05.208
What?

1:01:24.541 --> 1:01:26.125
<i>It's
of critical importance</i>

1:01:26.125 --> 1:01:28.166
<i>that you sign back
into the sim, Ms. Fisher.</i>

1:01:29.458 --> 1:01:30.541
<i>Immediately.</i>

1:01:31.500 --> 1:01:34.041
<i>You are in grave danger.</i>

1:01:34.125 --> 1:01:35.375
<i>An ad has been posted</i>

1:01:35.375 --> 1:01:38.041
<i>on the dark net offering
a $9 million bounty</i>

1:01:38.125 --> 1:01:41.250
<i>for a contract killing.
There's reason to...</i>

1:01:41.250 --> 1:01:42.750
<i>There's reason to believe
that you and your family</i>

1:01:42.750 --> 1:01:44.291
<i>are the intended target.</i>

1:01:47.416 --> 1:01:49.541
<i>The offer
has been accepted ...</i>

1:01:49.625 --> 1:01:51.208
<i>- The offer has been...
- The offer has been accepted
by a party...</i>

1:01:51.208 --> 1:01:53.708
<i>The offer has been accepted
by a party out of Memphis.</i>

1:01:55.458 --> 1:01:56.708
<i>I cannot assist you
in this emergency</i>

1:01:56.708 --> 1:01:57.916
<i>unless you sign back in.</i>

1:01:59.500 --> 1:02:00.833
<i>I repeat. I cannot</i>

1:02:00.833 --> 1:02:02.458
<i>assist you
in this emergency unless</i>

1:02:02.458 --> 1:02:03.708
<i>you sign back in.</i>

1:02:29.291 --> 1:02:30.791
Thing is,

1:02:30.875 --> 1:02:32.833
one of these nights, Conner's
gonna roll out of Jimmy's

1:02:32.833 --> 1:02:35.208
shit-faced again, and...

1:02:35.208 --> 1:02:36.375
he ain't gonna make it home.

1:02:38.125 --> 1:02:39.375
And that's
on all of us.

1:02:39.375 --> 1:02:40.875
Even if it's the one thing

1:02:40.875 --> 1:02:43.083
we've all somehow agreed
never to fucking talk about.

1:02:43.083 --> 1:02:45.916
How we had intel
on that situation.

1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:48.125
The one that got him
all blown up.

1:02:48.125 --> 1:02:51.875
We all let him choose
not to pay it any mind.

1:02:51.875 --> 1:02:53.166
Yeah, well...

1:02:54.708 --> 1:02:56.000
...it felt a little
more complicated

1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:58.375
than that, at the time.

1:02:58.375 --> 1:03:00.125
Burton!

1:03:00.125 --> 1:03:02.166
Hey, Flynne.

1:03:02.250 --> 1:03:03.916
What's going on?

1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:05.250
The mighty Flynne.

1:03:05.250 --> 1:03:06.583
Someone from that company's

1:03:06.583 --> 1:03:08.000
trying to contact me.

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:09.125
What company?

1:03:09.125 --> 1:03:11.208
Milagros whatever,
the Colombian one.

1:03:11.208 --> 1:03:13.583
He said someone put a hit on us

1:03:13.583 --> 1:03:14.833
for $9 million on the dark net.

1:03:21.625 --> 1:03:23.083
Fuck off. Y'all can laugh,

1:03:23.083 --> 1:03:25.500
but he went a fair ways if he
was just trying to freak me out.

1:03:25.500 --> 1:03:28.083
- Did he say why?
- No, he didn't say why. He said

1:03:28.083 --> 1:03:29.916
I just need to sign in again,
so he can help us.

1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:32.625
He's just trying to get you
back in the harness.

1:03:32.625 --> 1:03:34.791
I'll call him tomorrow,
tell him to fuck off.

1:03:34.875 --> 1:03:36.208
Why not tonight?

1:03:36.208 --> 1:03:38.583
'Cause I've got company, Flynne.

1:03:38.583 --> 1:03:40.541
And he's maybe a little
too drunk to find his phone.

1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.541
Hey, grab that 12-pack
from the fridge, would you?

1:03:44.625 --> 1:03:45.833
You're too drunk to fetch it,

1:03:45.833 --> 1:03:47.500
you're too drunk to drink it.

1:03:52.250 --> 1:03:53.416
What's she talking about?

1:03:54.666 --> 1:03:56.958
Sim developer.
Hired me to do a job.

1:03:56.958 --> 1:04:00.375
Hired your avatar, that is.
Meaning Flynne.

1:04:06.583 --> 1:04:09.458
Whatever's on your mind,

1:04:09.458 --> 1:04:11.541
might as well go ahead
and say it.

1:04:14.916 --> 1:04:16.291
Conner.

1:04:16.375 --> 1:04:18.250
What about him?

1:04:18.250 --> 1:04:20.541
What we were just talking about.

1:04:22.291 --> 1:04:24.041
His current state.

1:04:24.125 --> 1:04:26.250
How we all had warning

1:04:26.250 --> 1:04:28.791
and chose not to believe it.

1:04:28.875 --> 1:04:30.625
Like...

1:04:30.625 --> 1:04:33.541
a $9 million bounty.

1:04:41.291 --> 1:04:43.041
Are you serious?

1:04:54.416 --> 1:04:56.416
Still got those drones
in your car?

1:04:56.500 --> 1:04:59.625
Tommy Constantine was
asking after you the other day.

1:04:59.625 --> 1:05:02.666
Funny thing
about losing your sight?

1:05:03.916 --> 1:05:06.500
People get frozen in your mind.

1:05:06.500 --> 1:05:08.125
I know I've seen Tommy

1:05:08.125 --> 1:05:10.125
all grown up.

1:05:10.125 --> 1:05:13.458
And I ought to be able
to picture him that way,

1:05:13.458 --> 1:05:16.500
but you say his name,

1:05:16.500 --> 1:05:20.041
and I just see
a scrawny little boy.

1:05:20.125 --> 1:05:22.708
Him and Burton and the others

1:05:22.708 --> 1:05:25.625
on their bikes, racing down
that hill out front.

1:05:25.625 --> 1:05:27.083
That was a long time ago, Mama.

1:05:27.083 --> 1:05:29.666
What are they up to out there?

1:05:33.166 --> 1:05:35.291
Playing with their
stupid drones.

1:05:36.583 --> 1:05:38.583
None of them managed
to grow up, far as I can tell.

1:05:38.583 --> 1:05:41.666
Not many do, in my experience.

1:05:41.750 --> 1:05:44.125
- Sleeping pill?
- Yes, please.

1:05:51.125 --> 1:05:52.083
Ah.

1:05:52.083 --> 1:05:54.500
- All right, Mama.
- Mm.

1:05:54.500 --> 1:05:56.958
- Night night.
- Night. Love you.

1:05:56.958 --> 1:05:58.750
Love you.

1:06:06.458 --> 1:06:09.041
There something
I ought to know about?

1:06:09.125 --> 1:06:11.791
Just an excess of caution.

1:06:11.875 --> 1:06:12.875
Here.

1:06:12.875 --> 1:06:14.583
You got anything?

1:06:14.583 --> 1:06:16.958
No, not yet.

1:06:16.958 --> 1:06:18.708
We were
wondering, Flynne,

1:06:18.708 --> 1:06:21.208
you sure they didn't mean
nine dollars?

1:06:21.208 --> 1:06:22.458
Whoa.

1:06:22.458 --> 1:06:24.666
You fucking with us?

1:07:00.833 --> 1:07:02.208
Looks like
somebody's come hunting

1:07:02.208 --> 1:07:03.708
for that nine dollars.
