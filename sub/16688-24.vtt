00:02.480 --> 00:04.740
( Bells jingling )

00:04.840 --> 00:08.360
( Seasonal music plays )

00:20.960 --> 00:23.580
First ever Christmas
in space, guys!

00:23.680 --> 00:26.700
( Slurps ) First Christmas
hot chocolate in space.

00:26.800 --> 00:30.140
First time eating Benson's
peppermint bark in space.

00:30.240 --> 00:33.140
My first time making peppermint
bark in space!

00:33.240 --> 00:35.200
To be honest, the process
is pretty similar to

00:35.280 --> 00:37.900
the Earth version, but, somehow,
it just tastes better up here.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.220
( Munching )

00:39.320 --> 00:41.220
Yep. There's only one way
this Christmas

00:41.320 --> 00:42.860
could be any more
special.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.960
If we finally receive a message
from our loved ones

00:44.920 --> 00:46.920
telling us they're all right

00:46.120 --> 00:47.780
and we'll see
them again before we die?

00:47.880 --> 00:49.380
Eileen!

00:49.480 --> 00:51.480
He's talking about telling cool
Christmas stories!

00:51.080 --> 00:53.620
Ho ho ho!

00:53.720 --> 00:56.220
Well, it's really more of
a Halloween thing.

00:56.320 --> 00:59.140
What I'm talking about are cool
Christmas stories

00:59.240 --> 01:00.460
in the form of a song!

01:00.560 --> 01:02.140
Carols!

01:02.240 --> 01:04.940
And handbells!
Eh?

01:05.040 --> 01:06.960
So I'll sing the chorus,
and then you guys pick it up.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.820
Ding, dong, ding, dong

01:08.920 --> 01:12.460
Let's save the bell jingling for
when you're by yourself.

01:12.560 --> 01:15.500
Until then, I've got a story
about an icy snow planet

01:15.600 --> 01:18.380
called Celsius.

01:18.480 --> 01:22.300
Now, remember, we can only stay
while there's sunlight,

01:22.400 --> 01:25.300
and Celsius only has sunlight
for five minutes.

01:25.400 --> 01:28.100
Because if you're here after
it gets dark...

01:28.200 --> 01:30.820
Yeah, yeah, the Celsian
snow monsters will get us!

01:30.920 --> 01:32.780
You told us that, like,
10 times already!

01:32.880 --> 01:34.620
I'm just making sure
you understand

01:34.720 --> 01:36.720
the premise of this place!

01:35.920 --> 01:37.660
But we haven't seen snow
in forever!

01:37.760 --> 01:39.780
Yeah! Snow's what makes
Christmas Christmas!

01:39.880 --> 01:41.300
That, and presents!

01:41.400 --> 01:43.400
( Chanting ) White Christmas!
White Christmas!

01:42.680 --> 01:44.680
All right, all right!

01:50.200 --> 01:53.220
Five minutes, everyone,
starting...

01:53.320 --> 01:54.940
now!

01:55.040 --> 01:56.660
( Beeps )

01:56.760 --> 01:58.460
( All whooping )
Snow day!

01:58.560 --> 02:00.020
( Laughing )

02:00.120 --> 02:02.820
( All laughing )

02:02.920 --> 02:04.140
Look!

02:04.240 --> 02:05.340
( Giggling )

02:05.440 --> 02:07.220
All: Merry Christmas!

02:07.320 --> 02:08.380
( Oohing and aahing )

02:08.480 --> 02:10.620
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

02:10.720 --> 02:13.340
All right. Cute don't stop
the sun from setting!

02:13.440 --> 02:15.900
Come on, let's get a white
Christmas move on!

02:16.000 --> 02:19.200
( Caribbean style Christmas
music plays )

02:37.120 --> 02:38.340
( Beeps )

02:38.440 --> 02:40.060
Okay, that was fun!

02:40.160 --> 02:41.660
Back to the dome, everybody!

02:41.760 --> 02:43.460
But, wait!
I haven't done

02:43.560 --> 02:45.740
the Sorenstein Hanukkah
tradition of

02:45.840 --> 02:48.380
skiing down a big slope
in my underwear!

02:48.480 --> 02:49.580
Well, make it quick!

02:49.680 --> 02:51.340
We only have, like,
10 seconds left

02:51.440 --> 02:53.020
before the sun sets!

02:53.120 --> 02:55.620
Relax, bro!
Here I go!

02:55.720 --> 02:57.940
( Screaming )

02:58.040 --> 03:00.340
( Grunting )

03:00.440 --> 03:02.980
Oh, come on!
You're fine.

03:03.080 --> 03:04.940
Get up.
We don't have time for this!

03:05.040 --> 03:06.940
( Sobbing )

03:07.040 --> 03:09.340
I don't know.
It looks a little twisted?

03:09.440 --> 03:11.020
You can walk.
( Timer beeps )

03:11.120 --> 03:13.120
( Gasps )
Oh, no!

03:16.520 --> 03:17.740
Merry Christmas!

03:17.840 --> 03:20.100
( Roars )

03:20.200 --> 03:22.340
Back to the ship,
back to the ship!

03:22.440 --> 03:25.260
( Screaming )

03:25.360 --> 03:27.580
Merry Christmas!

03:27.680 --> 03:28.820
( Panting )

03:28.920 --> 03:30.580
( Grunting )

03:30.680 --> 03:33.340
Almost there!
Just keep running!

03:33.440 --> 03:35.720
( Screaming )
Merry Christmas!

03:37.440 --> 03:39.380
Monsters:
Merry Christmas!

03:39.480 --> 03:41.460
Okay, I'm not really sure what
to do now!

03:41.560 --> 03:43.540
There's only one thing
we can do ââ

03:43.640 --> 03:46.020
use your presents as weapons!

03:46.120 --> 03:48.120
( Grunting )

03:49.760 --> 03:52.140
It's holding them off!
Keep throwing stuff!

03:52.240 --> 03:53.740
( Grunts )

03:53.840 --> 03:56.860
Eileen, I spent a long time
customizing that for you!

03:56.960 --> 03:58.460
( Grunts )

03:58.560 --> 04:00.560
Mordecai, I had to
specialâorder that

04:00.040 --> 04:02.040
from the SnoâCone Machine
planet!

04:01.560 --> 04:03.620
I know! And I really
appreciate it,

04:03.720 --> 04:06.140
but Christmas isn't
about gifts!

04:06.240 --> 04:07.900
What?!
Yes, it is!

04:08.000 --> 04:10.160
Dude, what are you gonna take
with you when all this is over?!

04:10.240 --> 04:12.100
The stuff?
No! ( Grunts )

04:12.200 --> 04:14.020
The memories!
( Grunts )

04:14.120 --> 04:16.620
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!

04:16.720 --> 04:17.940
What do you mean, Mordecai?

04:18.040 --> 04:20.040
What Christmas is really about
is spending ââ

04:20.000 --> 04:21.300
Spending money?

04:21.400 --> 04:22.660
No!
( Grunts )

04:22.760 --> 04:24.260
Mordecai, what's it about?!

04:24.360 --> 04:27.380
It's about spending time
with friends!

04:27.480 --> 04:28.740
( All scream )

04:28.840 --> 04:30.380
Huh?

04:30.480 --> 04:32.540
Ludlow, the laserânosed
reindeer?

04:32.640 --> 04:34.860
That's right!
Santa sent me!

04:34.960 --> 04:37.060
He said he's sorry he couldn't
be here,

04:37.160 --> 04:39.660
but he's super proud of you guys
for realizing

04:39.760 --> 04:41.140
the true spirit of Christmas!

04:41.240 --> 04:42.180
Whoa, it's really him!

04:42.280 --> 04:43.500
From the "Ludlow" series!

04:43.600 --> 04:46.800
He looks just like himself!
Merry Christmas, guys!

04:46.680 --> 04:48.380
I'll take it from here.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.420
( Grunting )

04:50.520 --> 04:54.060
Cool! It's more effective
than presents!

04:54.160 --> 04:55.460
All: Thanks, Ludlow!

04:55.560 --> 04:56.900
No problem!

04:57.000 --> 04:59.220
See you guys on the next
Christmas special!

04:59.320 --> 05:01.300
Whoa!
It's so realistic.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.660
He barely has to move.
Stiff as a board.

05:03.760 --> 05:06.140
Well, what did you guys think?

05:06.240 --> 05:08.460
Considering we got our
white Christmas,

05:08.560 --> 05:11.180
made it out alive, and I didn't
have to sacrifice

05:11.280 --> 05:13.460
my awesome new twoâwheel
scooter, I'd say...

05:13.560 --> 05:15.420
All: Best Christmas ever!

05:15.520 --> 05:17.140
( Coughing )

05:17.240 --> 05:19.300
Was that supposed to be
heartâwarming?

05:19.400 --> 05:21.400
Because it was really more
scary than anything.

05:21.480 --> 05:22.940
I thought it was good.

05:23.040 --> 05:24.860
Oh, come on!
Snow monsters?

05:24.960 --> 05:27.100
Laserânosed Rudolph ripâoff?

05:27.200 --> 05:29.820
If we're going to tell Christmas
stories, which I maintain,

05:29.920 --> 05:31.920
is an inappropriate means
of celebration,

05:31.800 --> 05:34.660
they should at least be
wintry stories like this one.

05:34.760 --> 05:40.380
We were flying through a
Christmasâthemed asteroid field.

05:40.480 --> 05:42.060
Open your next gift, Skips!

05:42.160 --> 05:44.160
This one's from me and Rigby.

05:43.440 --> 05:45.180
We pooled all our gifts
this year.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.740
That way, if one us forgets,
you can just write your name

05:47.840 --> 05:50.060
on the card and nobody knows.
I learned it from my dad.

05:50.160 --> 05:53.100
Uh, thanks.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.780
It's a bazooka.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.860
Merry Christmas!

05:56.960 --> 05:58.820
What am I supposed to do
with it?

05:58.920 --> 06:00.460
It's a tâshirt cannon!
Yeah!

06:00.560 --> 06:02.380
They use 'em at
monster truck rallies

06:02.480 --> 06:03.980
to keep unruly fans at bay.

06:04.080 --> 06:07.180
From now on, whenever some jerk
gets out of control,

06:07.280 --> 06:10.740
you can be all "Hey, punk,
safeâtee not guaranteed."

06:10.840 --> 06:13.220
Whoops!
( Grunts )

06:13.320 --> 06:16.020
Oh!

06:16.120 --> 06:18.340
What a wonderful message!

06:18.440 --> 06:20.220
Well, that's all the gifts.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.700
Merry Christmas, everyone.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.800
It's cool we found
this asteroid field

06:23.360 --> 06:25.360
where they celebrate Christmas
all the time.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.880
Wish we could have got some
snow, though.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.260
Forget snow. I wish we
could get some carolers.

06:29.360 --> 06:30.820
Oh, yeah, carolers.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.920
I guess that would work.
I wouldn't mind some carolers.

06:45.600 --> 06:48.340
Look, all I'm saying is the odds
of a caroler knocking

06:48.440 --> 06:50.460
on the door right now are
slim to none.

06:50.560 --> 06:51.620
( Knock on door )

06:51.720 --> 06:53.380
Uh, was anyone expecting
company?

06:53.480 --> 06:54.860
( Knocking continues )

06:54.960 --> 06:56.300
Uh, hey, dude.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.740
Nice jacket.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.620
( Playing metal riff )

06:59.720 --> 07:01.740
Uh...
I think it's a caroler.

07:01.840 --> 07:04.500
On the first day of Christmas,
my true love gave to me

07:04.600 --> 07:06.060
A partridge in a pear tree

07:06.160 --> 07:07.660
Are those pears?

07:07.760 --> 07:09.700
I haven't had fruit
that wasn't freezeâdried

07:09.800 --> 07:11.220
since we left Earth.
Hmm.

07:11.320 --> 07:14.180
You're cool with me,
mysterious space dirtbag.

07:14.280 --> 07:15.620
( Screams )

07:15.720 --> 07:17.180
Get it off! Get it off!
Rigby!

07:17.280 --> 07:19.180
( Laughs )
I like this guy!

07:19.280 --> 07:21.140
( Grunts )
Dude, what ââ

07:21.240 --> 07:23.540
Whoa! On the second day of
Christmas

07:23.640 --> 07:25.740
my true love gave to me
two turtle doves

07:25.840 --> 07:27.860
And a partridge
in a pear tree

07:27.960 --> 07:29.340
( Laughing )

07:29.440 --> 07:32.340
( Screams ) Get 'em off!
Get 'em off!

07:32.440 --> 07:34.460
Okay, dude, thanks for the show,
but you gotta ââ

07:34.560 --> 07:37.100
Whoa!
( Grunts )

07:37.200 --> 07:39.460
On the third day of Christmas,
my true love gave to me

07:39.560 --> 07:41.180
No!
Three French hens

07:41.280 --> 07:44.140
Two turtle doves and a
partridge in a pear tree

07:44.240 --> 07:45.780
( Screams )

07:45.880 --> 07:48.820
( Gasping )

07:48.920 --> 07:50.500
What do we do?!
What do we do?!

07:50.600 --> 07:52.620
I ââ
don't know!

07:52.720 --> 07:55.340
Excuse me ââ
( Screams )

07:55.440 --> 07:57.140
( Growls )

07:57.240 --> 07:59.240
One the fourth day
of Christmas

07:58.720 --> 08:00.660
My true love gave to me
four calling birds

08:00.760 --> 08:02.460
Three French hens
Two turtle doves

08:02.560 --> 08:04.540
And a partridge
in a pear tree

08:04.640 --> 08:06.740
Why does this song
have so many birds?!

08:06.840 --> 08:08.380
( Screams )
Oh!

08:08.480 --> 08:10.480
On the fifth day of Christmas,
my true love ââ

08:10.080 --> 08:13.620
Shut up!
Five golden rings

08:13.720 --> 08:15.700
( Grunts )

08:15.800 --> 08:17.800
Whoa!

08:19.280 --> 08:22.300
( Screaming )

08:22.400 --> 08:23.420
Watch out!

08:26.000 --> 08:30.340
( Drum riff )

08:30.440 --> 08:32.440
( Gong! )

08:35.760 --> 08:37.020
( Honks )

08:37.120 --> 08:39.120
( Screams )

08:40.520 --> 08:42.520
( Grunting )

08:48.040 --> 08:50.460
This is crazy!
How do we get rid of this guy?!

08:50.560 --> 08:52.940
I don't know! What makes
a caroler leave you alone?!

08:53.040 --> 08:55.180
Uh!
Oh, dude ââ cookies!

08:55.280 --> 08:57.780
My mom always gave them cookies
and they'd go away!

08:57.880 --> 09:00.900
Everyone?!
We need cookies!

09:10.760 --> 09:12.220
It's for the greater good.

09:12.320 --> 09:14.860
The greater good.

09:14.960 --> 09:17.740
Santa's not the only one
eating cookies tonight.

09:17.840 --> 09:21.220
But we're all out of milk, so
these are babies going down dry.

09:21.320 --> 09:23.940
Partridges, partridges
Wha

09:24.040 --> 09:26.420
( Grunting )

09:26.520 --> 09:27.620
Huh?
Oh!

09:27.720 --> 09:30.260
( Laughing )

09:30.360 --> 09:33.260
( Metal version of
"Carol of the Bells" begins )

09:33.360 --> 09:37.540
( Growls )

09:37.640 --> 09:41.860
Handbell breakdown!

09:41.960 --> 09:42.940
( Growls )

09:43.040 --> 09:45.020
( Screams )
( Grunts )

09:45.120 --> 09:47.840
Hmm!

09:53.480 --> 09:55.340
Cookies, now!

09:55.440 --> 09:57.440
( Grunts )

10:00.000 --> 10:01.540
Come get some!

10:01.640 --> 10:02.900
( Snarls )

10:03.000 --> 10:04.060
Cookies!

10:04.160 --> 10:05.780
( Grunts )

10:05.880 --> 10:08.640
( Grunting )

10:11.560 --> 10:13.740
It's all I've ever wanted.

10:13.840 --> 10:15.460
Thank you.

10:15.560 --> 10:17.560
Whoa!

10:20.200 --> 10:22.660
You said you wanted snow.

10:22.760 --> 10:26.300
Now, that's a Christmas story,
am I right?

10:26.400 --> 10:28.860
Dude, you're not gonna make
handbells cool.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.260
Yeah, scale back
the agenda, bro.

10:31.360 --> 10:33.020
Handbells represent the purity

10:33.120 --> 10:35.780
and togetherness of
the holidays, you idiots!

10:35.880 --> 10:37.300
( Clanging )

10:37.400 --> 10:39.400
They sound like
angels whispering,

10:38.800 --> 10:40.800
and if you can't get that
through your skulls,

10:40.720 --> 10:42.260
that's on you, not me.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.260
We need more peppermint bark.
I'll be right back.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.740
( Bells jingling )

10:51.840 --> 10:53.420
Think we should go check on
Benson?

10:53.520 --> 10:55.580
( Grumbling )
Bells...

10:55.680 --> 10:59.000
Don't know anything about bells.
Ah, let him cool off in there.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.980
Yeah, besides, we've got another
Christmas story.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.980
It starts off just like this...

11:03.080 --> 11:05.300
Yeah, only Benson's
in a good mood.

11:05.400 --> 11:06.900
Hey, I heard that!

11:07.000 --> 11:09.540
Ho ho ho!

11:09.640 --> 11:11.500
Merry Christmas!

11:11.600 --> 11:15.140
Santa's got lots of presents for
each and every one of you!

11:15.240 --> 11:16.700
One for Muscleman,

11:16.800 --> 11:20.900
one for fives, and Eileen,
one for Skips, one for Pops.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.820
Wait, no ââ
this one's for Skips again.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.340
You must've been extra good!

11:24.440 --> 11:26.060
Pops' present is...

11:26.160 --> 11:28.860
Well, I know it's here.

11:28.960 --> 11:31.460
Santa had his little helpers get
it for him.

11:31.560 --> 11:34.300
You were supposed to get Pops'
present weeks ago!

11:34.400 --> 11:36.400
I even made a packet
specifically telling you

11:36.480 --> 11:39.300
what he wants, where to get it,
how much it was, who to talk to.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.460
That's too many instructions!
You confused us!

11:41.560 --> 11:44.020
What are we getting again?
An old fashioned typewriter!

11:44.120 --> 11:46.260
Just go get it now or Pops
will be crushed!

11:46.360 --> 11:48.020
Look at him!

11:48.120 --> 11:50.220
Pâpâpresent?

11:50.320 --> 11:52.180
But it's Christmas ââ
all the malls are closed.

11:52.280 --> 11:54.960
There's one mall open,
theoretically.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.740
Benson said it was around
here somewhere.

11:58.840 --> 12:00.900
Ugh! How are we supposed to
find this place

12:01.000 --> 12:02.660
if it's theoretical?
Wait, look!

12:02.760 --> 12:05.260
( "Twilight Zone" style
music playing )

12:05.360 --> 12:07.360
Do we go in?

12:09.440 --> 12:14.580
( Screaming )

12:14.680 --> 12:17.460
Huh?! Where are we?!
Where's the cart?

12:17.560 --> 12:19.860
Took care of it for ya ââ
valet services, ya see.

12:19.960 --> 12:22.340
Hmm, that's convenient.
Is this the mall?

12:22.440 --> 12:25.380
You could say it's a mall,
theoretically.

12:25.480 --> 12:26.580
What brings you two here,

12:26.680 --> 12:28.680
lastâminute holiday shopping,
I take it?

12:28.280 --> 12:30.200
Basically, we're here to buy
an oldâfashioned typewriter.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.280
Ah, those are on
the fifth floor,

12:31.520 --> 12:34.340
or should I say,
the fifth dimension.

12:34.440 --> 12:36.020
What?

12:36.120 --> 12:39.780
Now, now, we've got many floors
and dimensions to get through.

12:39.880 --> 12:42.500
( Bell dings )

12:42.600 --> 12:44.500
First floor, first dimension!

12:44.600 --> 12:47.580
( Screams )
Both: What was that?!

12:47.680 --> 12:50.460
Ah, it's all part of the ride ââ
dimensions and so on.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.060
( Bell dings )

12:52.160 --> 12:53.660
Whew, this seems normal.

12:53.760 --> 12:56.220
( Screams )
TwoâD!

12:56.320 --> 12:57.380
( Dings )

12:57.480 --> 12:59.760
Cool!

13:02.680 --> 13:05.820
HmâHmâHmâHmâHmâHmâHm!

13:05.920 --> 13:08.940
( Dings )

13:09.040 --> 13:10.860
Finally ââ the mall!

13:10.960 --> 13:12.860
Whoa, dude, they have
froâyo here!

13:12.960 --> 13:14.960
We should totally get froâyo
after this.

13:14.720 --> 13:18.180
Uh...
What was that?

13:18.280 --> 13:21.460
In the fifth dimension, you can
see all of your possible paths,

13:21.560 --> 13:23.220
even ones you don't
choose to do.

13:23.320 --> 13:25.320
Don't dilly dally.
The longer you stay,

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
the more complicated
things will become.

13:26.720 --> 13:28.100
Good luck.
( Bell dings )

13:28.200 --> 13:31.020
Come on. Let's just get that
typewriter and get out of here.

13:31.120 --> 13:32.580
Should we go up or down?

13:32.680 --> 13:33.940
Uh...

13:34.040 --> 13:38.420
Both: Whoa!
Fifth dimension.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.060
Dude, video games!

13:40.160 --> 13:42.220
Rigby, wait!
Focus, dude!

13:42.320 --> 13:43.820
( Laughs )

13:43.920 --> 13:45.420
( Continues laughing )

13:45.520 --> 13:47.180
No more distractions.

13:47.280 --> 13:48.940
Just think "typewriter."

13:49.040 --> 13:51.040
Typewriter, typewriter,
typewriter, typewriter.

13:50.920 --> 13:54.600
( Tchaikovsky's "Russian Dance"
from the "Nutcracker" plays )

14:06.560 --> 14:10.120
( Music playing over )

14:19.600 --> 14:22.540
Finally!
Let's get this to Pops.

14:22.640 --> 14:25.420
<i>Attention, customers ââ</i>
<i>the mall is now closed</i>

14:25.520 --> 14:28.500
<i>and will soon be imploding.</i>
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

14:28.600 --> 14:31.260
What?

14:31.360 --> 14:33.360
Hurry ââ to the elevator!

14:35.080 --> 14:36.580
( Alternates laughing )

14:36.680 --> 14:39.420
( Screaming )

14:39.520 --> 14:41.520
( Panting )

14:45.280 --> 14:47.420
Dude, the elevator is closing!

14:47.520 --> 14:49.680
Theoretically not!

14:56.560 --> 14:58.140
( Bell dings )
Huh?

14:58.240 --> 15:01.260
Looks, like you two had fun...

15:01.360 --> 15:03.520
theoretically.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.260
( Groaning )

15:07.360 --> 15:11.260
Merry Christmas, Pops!

15:11.360 --> 15:12.660
A typewriter!

15:12.760 --> 15:15.300
Just what I needed to finish
my memoir!

15:15.400 --> 15:19.020
Should I set it up in
the kitchen or my room?

15:19.120 --> 15:21.820
We could do both,
theoretically!

15:21.920 --> 15:23.260
( Laughter )

15:23.360 --> 15:25.180
The end.

15:25.280 --> 15:27.940
I liked the elevator.
Yeah, very inventive!

15:28.040 --> 15:29.820
Oh, but the typewriter
was my favorite!

15:29.920 --> 15:32.500
( Slow clapping )

15:32.600 --> 15:34.580
So, you guys want to
treat Christmas

15:34.680 --> 15:36.100
like it's Halloween, huh?

15:36.200 --> 15:38.260
Well, have I got a story
for you.

15:38.360 --> 15:39.580
( Crunch )

15:39.680 --> 15:41.300
All right, we got a lot of work

15:41.400 --> 15:43.860
to do to make it look Christmasy
around here.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.180
Skips and Muscleman,
set up the fake snow machine.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.780
Pops, you handle the wreaths.

15:47.880 --> 15:50.060
Mordecai and Rigby, go decorate
the Snack Shack ââ

15:50.160 --> 15:52.420
and go easy on
the lights, Rigby!

15:52.520 --> 15:54.580
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

15:54.680 --> 15:56.620
Dude, don't you think this is
a little much?

15:56.720 --> 15:59.300
Remember what Benson said?
Benson's a Scrooge!

15:59.400 --> 16:01.500
( Buzzing )

16:01.600 --> 16:04.980
Agh!
Not again!

16:05.080 --> 16:07.860
Why do you always disobey me?!

16:07.960 --> 16:09.300
Whatever.
You're not my dad!

16:09.400 --> 16:12.500
You know what, Rigby,
you're bad!

16:12.600 --> 16:14.540
You're a bad boy!

16:14.640 --> 16:16.820
And you have been all year!

16:16.920 --> 16:18.540
( Scoffs )
Name one time!

16:18.640 --> 16:21.740
Rigby, you are a bad boy!

16:21.840 --> 16:24.140
Hey, man, no one's perfect.

16:24.240 --> 16:26.020
Well, enough is enough!

16:26.120 --> 16:28.180
No Santa for you
this Christmas!

16:28.280 --> 16:30.980
This year, you'll get a visit
from Krampus!

16:31.080 --> 16:33.060
Who?
He's the antiâSanta.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.940
Instead of giving presents,
Krampus comes to punish

16:36.040 --> 16:38.940
all the bad children by stuffing
them into his basket.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.500
Huh.
It's a European thing.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.100
I'm sending him an eâmail
about you right now.

16:44.200 --> 16:47.060
You wouldn't do that.
( Beeps )

16:47.160 --> 16:50.140
( Gasps )
You're ruining my life!

16:50.240 --> 16:52.380
( Sobbing )

16:52.480 --> 16:54.860
You know Krampus
isn't real, right?

16:54.960 --> 16:58.680
Oh, I know.
Just trying to scare him.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.620
( Bells jingling )

17:04.720 --> 17:06.340
( Beeping )

17:06.440 --> 17:09.220
Oh, Benson,
we have an incoming call

17:09.320 --> 17:12.140
from somebody named
Kramâpus.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.820
Huh?

17:13.920 --> 17:16.420
Hi, hello.

17:16.520 --> 17:19.180
Is there a Rigby on board?

17:19.280 --> 17:23.060
Uh, Krampus!
It's really you, ha.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.620
I gotta be honest, I didn't
even know you existed.

17:25.720 --> 17:27.700
Yeah, I got your eâmail.

17:27.800 --> 17:30.540
You know, the one about me
stealing Rigby

17:30.640 --> 17:32.500
and punishing him forever?

17:32.600 --> 17:34.700
Oh, that?
That was just a joke.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.300
We don't really need you,
but, thanks, anyway!

17:37.400 --> 17:39.500
"Thanks, anyway"?

17:39.600 --> 17:42.620
It was a real hassle getting
over here, ya know.

17:42.720 --> 17:45.100
You've wasted my time, Benson!

17:45.200 --> 17:46.820
You're bad!

17:46.920 --> 17:49.380
You've been a bad boy!

17:49.480 --> 17:50.940
( All scream )

17:51.040 --> 17:53.380
( Alarm blaring )

17:53.480 --> 17:55.480
( Roars )

18:00.080 --> 18:01.380
( Siren blares )

18:01.480 --> 18:02.420
He broke through!

18:02.520 --> 18:04.100
Get to your battle stations!

18:04.200 --> 18:06.200
Go, go, go!

18:10.120 --> 18:12.120
( Beeping )

18:17.800 --> 18:19.300
( All gasp )

18:19.400 --> 18:21.700
You're bad!

18:21.800 --> 18:23.620
You're all bad!

18:23.720 --> 18:25.500
You know what that means!

18:25.600 --> 18:27.140
( Grunts )

18:27.240 --> 18:29.660
Bask in my basket!

18:29.760 --> 18:30.700
( Screams )

18:30.800 --> 18:34.540
This ain't no gift basket!

18:34.640 --> 18:36.420
( Groaning )

18:36.520 --> 18:38.460
Get in here, you basket case!

18:38.560 --> 18:39.900
( Whimpering )

18:40.000 --> 18:41.580
Aâtisket, aâtasket

18:41.680 --> 18:43.780
I'll put this green chunkadunk
in my basket

18:43.880 --> 18:46.660
Stop!
These puns are terrible!

18:46.760 --> 18:48.760
( Grunting )

18:51.280 --> 18:53.700
( Screaming )

18:53.800 --> 18:56.620
( Chuckling )

18:56.720 --> 18:59.620
Krampus, please, it doesn't
have to be this way!

18:59.720 --> 19:04.740
I came to punish Rigby,
and I'm not leaving until I do!

19:04.840 --> 19:06.660
Hey, I'm his boss!

19:06.760 --> 19:09.500
If anyone is going to punish
Rigby, it's me!

19:09.600 --> 19:10.980
( Tone rings )

19:11.080 --> 19:13.340
( Screams )
What is that horrible sound?!

19:13.440 --> 19:15.180
Oh, wait ââ these?

19:15.280 --> 19:16.980
( Krampus growls )
Handbells?!

19:17.080 --> 19:20.180
Why does it always have to
be handbells?!

19:20.280 --> 19:22.280
Guys, catch!

19:24.920 --> 19:26.620
( Growls )

19:26.720 --> 19:28.540
Follow my lead!

19:28.640 --> 19:31.060
( Plays "Carol of the Bells" )

19:31.160 --> 19:33.580
( Joining in )

19:33.680 --> 19:36.380
( Growls )

19:36.480 --> 19:41.740
I can't handle such concentrated
Christmas cheer!

19:41.840 --> 19:47.620
( Music continues )

19:47.720 --> 19:49.880
( Screaming )

19:52.760 --> 19:54.740
We are free!
( Laughing )

19:54.840 --> 19:57.620
We are free!

19:57.720 --> 20:00.940
Whoa! Krampus was made
of fruitcakes!

20:01.040 --> 20:02.660
It's a Christmas miracle!

20:02.760 --> 20:04.340
Benson, you were right.

20:04.440 --> 20:06.600
Jeez, when will I learn not to
question your authority?

20:06.680 --> 20:09.420
Don't beat yourself up.
You'll learn someday.

20:09.520 --> 20:12.580
Well, I definitely learned
one thing ââ

20:12.680 --> 20:14.580
handbells are the coolest!

20:14.680 --> 20:17.280
( Chanting ) Handbells!
Handbells! Handbells!

20:18.720 --> 20:22.460
Handbells, handbells, handbells!

20:22.560 --> 20:25.780
Dude, Benson, that was actually
a pretty cool story...

20:25.880 --> 20:27.700
till you ruined it with
the handbells.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.780
Yeah!
Nobody likes handbells!

20:29.880 --> 20:32.180
( Loud thump )

20:32.280 --> 20:35.700
Ho ho ho! Did I hear someone say
"handbells"?

20:35.800 --> 20:37.820
Oh, gross.
Who are you?

20:37.920 --> 20:41.340
I'm not gross!
I'm Space Santa, silly!

20:41.440 --> 20:45.020
I've been travelling billions of
light years to find someone

20:45.120 --> 20:47.820
who has just as much Christmas
spirit as I do.

20:47.920 --> 20:50.940
And that someone is you,
Benson!

20:51.040 --> 20:54.980
Me?
