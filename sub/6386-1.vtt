Hi, daddy.

00:17.630 --> 00:19.364
This is Bill's daughter, Mia,

00:19.399 --> 00:20.599
and this is Hank.

00:20.633 --> 00:22.567
You... you two know each other?

00:22.602 --> 00:25.871
- No.
- I am 16, you know.

00:25.905 --> 00:28.173
- What's this?
- Hank's new book.

00:28.207 --> 00:29.508
Are you really 16?

00:29.542 --> 00:32.009
- I'm really 16.
- This is really good.

00:32.045 --> 00:34.012
It's not a memoir.

00:34.047 --> 00:35.881
It's a written account of
my sexual relationship with you.

00:35.915 --> 00:38.283
Written by me
as a fucking novel.

00:38.318 --> 00:41.453
I know you've set him up,
stole his book.

00:41.487 --> 00:42.788
And what are you gonna do
about it, huh?

00:42.822 --> 00:44.923
I got to ask,
since you always tend to write

00:44.957 --> 00:46.291
exactly what you know,

00:46.326 --> 00:48.694
what's the fucking deal?

00:48.728 --> 00:51.363
You have done some
fucked-up shit in your time,

00:51.397 --> 00:54.266
but I didn't think
you'd do that.

00:55.702 --> 00:57.669
We have to love him
for who he is,

00:57.704 --> 01:00.372
not his potential.

01:00.406 --> 01:01.907
Go.
Drive the car.

01:01.941 --> 01:03.141
Karen.

01:03.176 --> 01:04.976
You're saying that the three
of us move back

01:05.010 --> 01:06.011
to New York together?

01:06.045 --> 01:07.713
Well, soon, yeah.

01:07.747 --> 01:09.514
Okay?

01:09.549 --> 01:11.183
Look what the cat dragged in.

01:11.217 --> 01:13.819
What brings you

01:13.853 --> 01:16.355
I'm doing a little

I want you guys to come.

01:19.258 --> 01:21.793
- Oh. Hey.
- Wow.

01:21.828 --> 01:24.529
Quite the literary scandal
we have here.

01:24.564 --> 01:26.064
Why would you tell him?

01:26.099 --> 01:27.499
Because I'm in love with him.

01:27.533 --> 01:29.301
Think about Karen
and think about Becca.

01:29.335 --> 01:30.869
Hank, it doesn't have
to be this way.

01:32.705 --> 01:34.206
- Stop!
- You're fucked, Moody.

01:34.240 --> 01:35.507
I need to tell you something.

- It's my family.
- Is it true?

hugely complicated.

up and move you aside

How is she?

05:46.525 --> 05:48.426
Oh, she's great.
She's fantastic.

05:48.461 --> 05:49.961
I can't keep her
off the computer, though,

05:49.996 --> 05:51.663
'cause she doesn't believe
a word of it.

05:51.697 --> 05:53.264
She thinks you were set up.

05:53.299 --> 05:55.133
Do you want to take that
away from her?

05:55.167 --> 05:56.568

to look her in the eye

05:56.602 --> 05:58.737
and tell her
that you put your dick

05:58.771 --> 06:01.706
in a girl that's the same age
that she is right now?

06:01.741 --> 06:03.408

some serious progress here.

a change of clothes.

06:32.071 --> 06:34.406
Yes.

- Sure do.
- Hmm?

Mm-hmm.

Hank.

06:41.480 --> 06:44.549
Hank. Hank.

06:44.583 --> 06:46.151
Is there something
I should know here?

06:46.185 --> 06:47.585
- Such as?
- Is he retarded?

06:47.620 --> 06:50.288
- Hey.
- He's actually quite a good guy

06:50.322 --> 06:51.856

06:51.891 --> 06:53.825

very agreeable.

06:53.859 --> 06:55.193
Good to know,

06:55.227 --> 06:57.429
because on paper he looks
like a total piece of shit.

- Hey, now.
- Abby here is the best there is

06:59.632 --> 07:01.733
at defending
the unjustly accused.

who kept showing his penis

07:04.870 --> 07:05.937

07:05.971 --> 07:08.506
- She totally got him off.
- Impressive.

07:08.541 --> 07:13.078
So what was it you wanted
to do, Abby, you know, before?

07:13.112 --> 07:15.313
Okay, I'll play.

07:15.347 --> 07:16.581
Before what?

07:16.615 --> 07:19.350
Before you sold out
and went to law school.

07:19.385 --> 07:21.252
- Up top.
- Cute.

07:21.287 --> 07:22.754
Can't help it.
The guy's cute.

07:22.788 --> 07:24.089
He's also
a three-time loser.

07:24.123 --> 07:26.591
Well, now you're
just name-calling.

07:26.625 --> 07:28.893
It says here you were arrested
for assaulting a, uh, filmmaker

07:28.928 --> 07:30.028
named Todd Carr.

07:30.062 --> 07:31.763
Uh, shitty filmmaker
named Todd Carr.

07:31.797 --> 07:34.199
Does it say "shitty" there?
'Cause it should.

07:34.233 --> 07:35.834
The charges were dropped
at Mr. Carr's request.

07:35.868 --> 07:37.402
Shortly thereafter,
an altercation

07:37.436 --> 07:39.170
with an L.A.P.D. officer.

07:39.205 --> 07:42.307
Mm.
Got off light... probation.

07:42.341 --> 07:44.876
How'd you manage that one?

07:44.910 --> 07:46.611
Really?

07:46.645 --> 07:48.713
- He'd just had a vasectomy.
- Point being?

07:48.748 --> 07:52.150
Cop nightsticked him
in the balls...

07:52.184 --> 07:53.685
- Big misunderstanding.
- Oh, yeah.

07:53.719 --> 07:54.853

of the epididymitis.

of tepid bathwater.

of my time.

08:13.372 --> 08:15.673
my big, beautiful balls.

08:15.708 --> 08:17.175
It was inappropriate.

08:17.209 --> 08:18.576
No, I get it.
I get it.

08:18.611 --> 08:19.978
I get how serious
this all is, you know,

08:20.012 --> 08:21.312
and I don't want to waste
your time.

08:21.347 --> 08:22.814

- Yes.

to do whatever voodoo it is

08:25.284 --> 08:27.685

08:27.720 --> 08:30.255
So I'm gonna...
I put myself in your hands.

08:30.289 --> 08:31.656

08:31.690 --> 08:34.359
I'll tumble for you.
I'll do whatever it takes.

08:40.698 --> 08:42.167
Start with a shower.

out of a fisting contest.

- I won't lie.

All will be revealed
in good time, my friend.

Meanwhile, I gots
to drain the hog.

09:16.969 --> 09:18.203
Oh, come on.

We all know that thing is thin,
bent, and uncircumcised.

09:20.706 --> 09:22.040
- Don't bullshit me.
- Jesus Christ.

09:22.074 --> 09:23.408
How many times
I got to tell you?

09:23.442 --> 09:24.709
I am not uncircumcised.

09:24.743 --> 09:27.145
The mohel just left
a little too much foreskin.

09:27.179 --> 09:29.180
That's all...
a smidge, just a smidge.

09:29.215 --> 09:32.617
[Laughs]
So it's like a circ-du-halfway?

09:32.651 --> 09:34.052

Get used to it.

18:43.468 --> 18:44.735
Th I want to go to your place.

18:44.770 --> 18:47.037
My place?
My place is in fucking escrow.

18:47.072 --> 18:48.739
I'm living on borrowed time

18:48.774 --> 18:50.241
in a house
that no longer belongs to me

18:50.275 --> 18:52.143
with a woman who no longer
wants anything to do with me.

18:52.177 --> 18:54.245
You're not the only exile
on main street, Hank.

18:54.279 --> 18:55.479
Whatever.
I'd settle

18:55.514 --> 18:57.081
for a decent night's sleep
at this point.

18:57.115 --> 18:58.549
Well, maybe your newest,
bestest friend

18:58.583 --> 19:00.651
- will let you crash.
- Oh, bullshit.

19:00.685 --> 19:02.953
I have, like, zero interest
in chasing tail right now.

19:02.988 --> 19:05.322
That's fine...
totally understandable.

19:05.357 --> 19:07.892
But you should have interest
in chasing this job.

19:07.926 --> 19:09.960
You always talk a big game

19:09.995 --> 19:12.163
about doing the good work
and fighting the good fight.

19:12.197 --> 19:13.731
Well, here's your chance.

19:13.765 --> 19:16.000
Stop feeling
so fucking sorry for yourself

19:16.034 --> 19:17.601
and get in there and <i>carpe</i>

19:17.636 --> 19:18.936
- the fuck out of this shit.
- All right.

19:18.970 --> 19:20.571
We're sure this is just
about rewriting my history,

19:20.605 --> 19:22.139
not yours.

19:22.174 --> 19:24.175
So what if it is, huh?

19:24.209 --> 19:25.910
You think I wouldn't jump
at the chance

19:25.944 --> 19:27.311
to get back some version
of what I lost?

19:27.345 --> 19:28.946
You don't think I deserve that?

19:35.287 --> 19:37.321
Fine.

19:37.355 --> 19:39.990
I'll give it a shot.

19:40.025 --> 19:41.826
- I knew you would.
- Asshole.

some notes,

20:10.255 --> 20:13.057
you really had
some fucking notes.

20:13.091 --> 20:14.158
Do they make sense?

20:14.192 --> 20:16.060
Uh, they will eventually,

20:16.094 --> 20:18.529
when I get around
to reading the script.

20:18.563 --> 20:21.065
I think we're pretty much
on the same page...

20:21.099 --> 20:22.533
Or pages.

20:22.567 --> 20:26.570
- [Laughs]
- Pages and pages and pages.

20:26.605 --> 20:27.838

20:27.873 --> 20:31.475
Yeah, well,
it's been a long life.

20:31.510 --> 20:33.911

I ain't got none.

20:36.715 --> 20:39.583
I'm homeless.

20:39.618 --> 20:42.152
You're pretty handsome
for a homeless fellow.

20:42.187 --> 20:44.588
I don't know about that.

20:44.623 --> 20:47.091
But I do have great tits.
[Laughs]

20:47.125 --> 20:48.759

if you want.

I have plenty of room...

20:50.462 --> 20:51.829

what all girls want...
