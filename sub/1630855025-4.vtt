08:37.140 --> 08:38.470
Rana.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.190
Look how long she holds it now.

08:54.490 --> 08:55.700
Amani, look!

08:59.450 --> 09:00.560
What are you doing?

09:00.760 --> 09:02.870
Girls are not allowed to do that.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.070
Who taught you this?

09:06.270 --> 09:07.250
He's hurting her!

09:07.540 --> 09:09.250
Girls aren't allowed to do this!

09:09.670 --> 09:10.920
I'm sorry.

09:12.970 --> 09:13.840
When will you understand, when?

09:14.220 --> 09:15.030
Stop!

09:15.230 --> 09:16.340
When?

09:16.680 --> 09:18.080
Why doesn't she hurt him back?

09:18.280 --> 09:19.050
She's frightened.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.020
Get up!

09:23.890 --> 09:24.770
Mahmud!

09:26.400 --> 09:27.590
Leave her alone!

09:27.790 --> 09:28.810
Let her stand!

09:29.770 --> 09:30.770
Get inside!

09:31.530 --> 09:32.650
Get out of here!

09:33.150 --> 09:34.640
No good comes from this electric curse.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.950
Shame on you!

09:41.370 --> 09:42.870
My poor darling.

09:48.500 --> 09:49.780
Halla? You okay?

09:49.980 --> 09:50.860
It's my Amal.

09:51.060 --> 09:54.210
Please help... She used
the electricity in her hands.

09:54.970 --> 09:57.840
One of the boys saw her and hit her.

09:59.720 --> 10:01.410
The police are coming.

10:01.610 --> 10:03.770
I'll come with you.

10:04.390 --> 10:05.930
Stay home, don't go out.

10:40.890 --> 10:44.830
Together we can protect her.
She needs to go to the hospital.

10:45.030 --> 10:46.670
Let us see her!

10:46.870 --> 10:48.130
She used the electricity.

10:48.330 --> 10:49.500
She's just a little girl!

10:49.700 --> 10:52.110
Bring the girl out, we want to see her!

10:52.520 --> 10:53.970
She has no shame...

10:54.170 --> 10:55.400
...don't touch me!

10:56.070 --> 10:57.530
Everybody calm down.

10:58.150 --> 10:59.180
The police have been called.

10:59.380 --> 11:00.570
Justice for Amal!

11:09.040 --> 11:12.750
Ladies, ladies... no filming!

11:15.500 --> 11:18.380
The police are coming to arrest her,
block the door!

11:19.380 --> 11:20.700
No filming.

11:20.900 --> 11:22.180
Stop!

11:22.720 --> 11:23.790
Enough.

11:23.990 --> 11:25.180
Stop filming!

11:27.390 --> 11:29.560
That's enough, go home!

11:45.370 --> 11:49.790
Women, stop this. Stop this.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.620
The police are going.

11:53.250 --> 11:54.670
Justice for Amal!

11:55.540 --> 11:57.840
Bring Amal out! It's safe now!

11:58.090 --> 11:59.910
Justice for Amal!

12:00.110 --> 12:02.090
Calmly, calmly.

12:11.060 --> 12:13.650
Patience, patience please.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.690
Make way.
We are taking her to the hospital.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.250
Spread the word!

12:35.130 --> 12:36.670
Stay with me.

12:39.210 --> 12:41.590
The police got scared and ran away.

12:44.800 --> 12:45.800
Gently.

12:48.470 --> 12:50.540
We will march with you to the hospital!

12:50.740 --> 12:51.920
We are with you.

12:52.120 --> 12:53.390
Justice for Amal!

12:56.770 --> 12:58.440
Spread the word!

13:00.030 --> 13:01.990
See us! Hear us!

13:03.820 --> 13:05.450
See us! Hear us!

18:43.280 --> 18:44.870
Help me!

19:05.430 --> 19:07.180
Tear gas! Run!

24:05.860 --> 24:09.610
Come join us!

24:12.490 --> 24:13.780
Up here!

24:15.740 --> 24:16.770
What's this?

24:16.970 --> 24:18.240
Help me!

24:19.040 --> 24:20.360
I'm trapped here!

24:20.550 --> 24:22.400
He won't let me go!

24:22.600 --> 24:24.790
Come back inside!

24:27.800 --> 24:29.420
She's trapped, let's go together.

24:31.010 --> 24:32.760
Rise up!

24:39.560 --> 24:42.850
Equality!

28:57.150 --> 28:59.900
Get back! Disperse or we will open fire!

29:00.230 --> 29:02.110
Freedom. Freedom now!

29:04.780 --> 29:06.240
Forward!

29:07.660 --> 29:09.330
Attack!

29:28.430 --> 29:30.850
Come, help me. Use your hands.

29:36.650 --> 29:37.900
Hold!

30:14.020 --> 30:18.190
My son... have some mercy.

30:19.860 --> 30:21.400
We just want to pass, son.

30:25.780 --> 30:29.320
Heaven lies at the feet of your mother.

30:33.330 --> 30:36.500
Heaven lies at the feet of your mother.

31:03.690 --> 31:05.320
Lower your weapons!

31:07.820 --> 31:08.990
Take my hand.

31:12.070 --> 31:13.310
What are you doing?

31:13.510 --> 31:16.650
We want to stop them, not kill them.

31:16.850 --> 31:20.330
Please. Help them down.

40:51.530 --> 40:53.350
He deserves it.

40:53.550 --> 40:56.030
Stop recording.

41:10.510 --> 41:12.630
What are you doing? Get away from her!

41:18.810 --> 41:20.290
He's with me!

41:20.490 --> 41:23.890
Leave him!
Leave him, he's with me!

44:13.480 --> 44:14.970
Hi, Nadya.

44:15.160 --> 44:16.020
Can you hear me?

57:08.800 --> 57:10.420
All of you, sit the fuck down!
