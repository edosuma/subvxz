let him go in there.

07:27.339 --> 07:28.855

waited for backup.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.453

gone into that pond,

his life or that little boy's,

a thousand times over

08:11.566 --> 08:13.992

Or worse.

All the reason we can't
stand around and argue about it.

09:11.718 --> 09:14.127

but he's gonna slow us down.

09:14.279 --> 09:15.536

anybody behind.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.881

but the doc said I'm not gonna
lose any fingers or toes,

10:30.038 --> 10:31.037

11:16.568 --> 11:18.009
I-I mean that.

11:19.087 --> 11:20.995

hug again, huh?

11:23.258 --> 11:25.758

...we love you, too.

11:25.911 --> 11:27.352
I love you, bro.

11:28.522 --> 11:29.913
(thumps chest)

11:29.915 --> 11:31.097
Alright, stop.
Whatever, man.

11:31.249 --> 11:33.507
Hey, so what happened
with Marjan?

11:33.585 --> 11:36.753
Did she get Cap to finally sign
that apology letter to Billy?

11:36.771 --> 11:38.421
Remains to be seen.

11:38.423 --> 11:40.031
Oh, is he still being stubborn?

11:40.183 --> 11:41.682
No, we just ain't
heard from her.

11:41.702 --> 11:42.867
-PAUL: Really?
-Yeah.

11:43.019 --> 11:44.536
Feels like she would have
checked in by now.

11:44.687 --> 11:46.204
Cell service is out.
I mean, I'm sure her and Cap

11:46.281 --> 11:47.872
are riding out the storm
together right now.

11:48.024 --> 11:49.356
JUDD: God help the man

11:49.601 --> 11:52.210
if he don't sign that letter
before he walks out of there.

11:52.287 --> 11:53.953
Knowing Marj,
if he doesn't sign,

11:54.030 --> 11:55.714
he's not walking out at all.

11:55.790 --> 11:57.106
(laughter)

11:57.125 --> 11:58.775
-Pow!
-Right in the kisser!

11:58.793 --> 12:00.944
-(knock on door)
-Everybody decent?

12:00.946 --> 12:03.704
Honey, you didn't
even give him
a chance to answer.

12:03.798 --> 12:05.131
COLE: Neither did you, dear.

12:05.283 --> 12:06.874
All right,
please forgive my husband.

12:06.952 --> 12:09.135
He's a little overeager today.

12:09.212 --> 12:10.895
No worries, ma'am.
It's nice to see
you guys in here.

12:11.047 --> 12:11.955
COLE: Good to see you.

12:12.048 --> 12:14.123
You guys are so embarrassing!

12:14.142 --> 12:16.217
Sorry, Paul, my parents insisted

12:16.236 --> 12:18.294
on bringing by
a few gifts to thank you.

12:18.313 --> 12:19.553
Nah, it's okay.

12:19.647 --> 12:22.223
Guys, you-you really
didn't have to do all this.

12:22.242 --> 12:22.982
COLE: Please.

12:23.151 --> 12:24.801
You saved our daughter's life.

12:24.894 --> 12:26.077
It's the least we could do.

12:27.063 --> 12:29.155
Here, open this one first.

12:29.232 --> 12:32.399
-It is a lambswool throw.
-Oh.

12:32.452 --> 12:33.585
Spoiler alert.

12:33.661 --> 12:34.919
COLE: What?

12:35.071 --> 12:36.755
He's recovering
from hypothermia.

12:36.906 --> 12:38.089
He can open his Rolexes later.

12:38.316 --> 12:41.651
Uh, did he just say
Rolexes with an "S"?

12:41.669 --> 12:43.077
-COLE: Try this.
-Yeah, I think he did.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.429
COLE:
This is the warmest blanket

12:44.506 --> 12:46.747

of the Siberian tundra.

12:46.767 --> 12:47.840
Oh, my God, Dad.

12:47.993 --> 12:50.326
Again, Paul, I'm so sorry.

12:50.345 --> 12:52.512
-It's...
-COLE: You don't like it?
Is it the color?

12:52.664 --> 12:55.089
If you don't like the color,
we can get you a new one
on special order.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.349
MATEO:
Just say you like it, Paul,

12:56.501 --> 12:57.683
that way they don't
have to kill another lamb.

12:57.852 --> 12:59.760
-It's good.
-No, they don't
have to kill a lamb,

12:59.854 --> 13:00.761
they just shave it bare.

13:00.855 --> 13:02.839
MATEO:
Oh, then it's good then.

13:02.857 --> 13:03.782
Oh, soft...

13:04.117 --> 13:06.692
Seriously, it's
a very lovely blanket, but...

13:06.845 --> 13:07.844
You're too generous.

13:07.862 --> 13:09.621
COLE: No, we're just
getting started.

13:09.848 --> 13:10.938
Would you like a Maserati?

13:10.957 --> 13:12.348

13:12.367 --> 13:14.083
Maserati.

13:14.869 --> 13:16.777
(laughing continues)

13:16.855 --> 13:18.279
Wait, I'm sorry, what?

13:18.356 --> 13:19.964
A car, I'd like
to get you a car.

13:20.116 --> 13:22.550
Unless you'd prefer a truck.

13:23.452 --> 13:24.377
What...

13:24.453 --> 13:25.637
No... No, no.

13:25.746 --> 13:27.138
I couldn't possibly accept it.
That's too much.

13:27.290 --> 13:28.956
I could. You know,
we were at the rescue too.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.309
Lindsey, remember us?
We were the ones
with the jackhammers?

13:31.460 --> 13:32.626
Oh, forgive me,
let me get your names.

13:32.704 --> 13:35.963
-Matteo Chavez. C-H-A-V--
-We're okay.

13:35.982 --> 13:36.873
Actually, we're all right.

13:36.891 --> 13:38.224
Thank you very much, but, uh,

the reward of being
a firefighter's
in the job itself.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.545
COLE: I respect that.

13:42.564 --> 13:44.138
I feel the same way
about my work.

13:44.215 --> 13:46.232
-What's your line of work?
-Milk cartons.

13:46.309 --> 13:49.310
What, you could afford
all this swag
from selling milk?

13:49.329 --> 13:52.205
Not the milk.
Just the cartons.

13:52.982 --> 13:54.815
-Milk cartons.
-Wow.

13:54.893 --> 13:56.059

-GRACE: Oh!
-We couldn't resist.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.598
This is really sweet.
Thank you.

21:07.825 --> 21:11.327
We know.
And if you wouldn't mind
going into labor on Saturday,

21:11.329 --> 21:12.937
-we could split the pot.
-Oh, goodness.

21:13.088 --> 21:14.939
Y'all have a baby pool on me?

21:15.016 --> 21:16.274
Okay, that's tampering, Joel.

21:16.425 --> 21:17.591
Besides, we all know

21:17.610 --> 21:19.502
the smart money's on Thursday,
right, Grace?

21:19.504 --> 21:20.778
Let's pump the brakes

21:20.929 --> 21:23.263
because this due date
is not for another two weeks.

21:23.283 --> 21:26.675
Please. She's related to you,
Miss Early To Everything.

21:26.677 --> 21:29.011
Mm-mmm. No.
She is also related to Judd,

21:29.104 --> 21:30.788
and that boy likes
to take his sweet time.

21:30.865 --> 21:32.848
-Does he now?
-Tsk. Oh.

21:32.850 --> 21:34.366

22:30.741 --> 22:32.350

22:32.426 --> 22:33.684
Uh, 12.

22:33.836 --> 22:35.186
We've got quite a few injuries.

22:35.262 --> 22:37.521

at least one RA unit.

22:39.917 --> 22:42.585

Well, I'm glad
they sent you anyway.

22:46.757 --> 22:48.924

22:48.943 --> 22:52.370

about a pack of illegals

23:45.149 --> 23:46.498

23:46.651 --> 23:49.835
You can send me back,
but not before I see them.

23:53.916 --> 23:56.492

gotta follow regulations,

23:56.494 --> 23:57.676

23:57.753 --> 23:59.845

two reasons we do anything.

There's a good reason,
and then there's the real one.

32:50.785 --> 32:53.119
So how about you just admit it?

32:53.197 --> 32:57.140

that place permanently,

32:57.292 --> 32:58.475
you couldn't resist.

33:44.765 --> 33:46.481
(Grace gasps)

33:49.010 --> 33:52.237
-What am I supposed
to tell my husband?
-It wasn't me?

33:54.182 --> 33:56.992
(sirens wailing)

33:58.095 --> 34:00.428
Alright, sir.
Watch your head.

34:00.447 --> 34:03.948
Thanks. We'll contact you if we
have any further questions.

34:04.101 --> 34:06.434
Captain Strand,
is the office or the cell

34:06.436 --> 34:07.878
the best number to reach you?

34:07.954 --> 34:10.455
For the foreseeable future,
cell.

34:10.607 --> 34:13.467
Assuming we ever get
any reception back.

34:16.947 --> 34:18.463
MARJAN:
So what happens to them?

34:18.615 --> 34:20.140
(siren wails)

34:20.875 --> 34:22.392
It's not up to us.

34:22.544 --> 34:24.728
Now, I'm confused.

34:24.879 --> 34:25.878
About what?

34:25.972 --> 34:28.398
Why won't you sign
that letter of apology?

34:30.310 --> 34:33.795
I mean, is it an ego thing,
is it a guy thing?

34:33.797 --> 34:37.574
I mean, it seems like
everybody thought this guy
Bobby had it coming,

34:37.651 --> 34:39.651
so you're just
gonna let him win?

34:39.727 --> 34:42.654
First of all, it's Billy.

34:42.730 --> 34:44.139
And really, Marjan?

34:44.157 --> 34:46.566
What?
Just getting another opinion.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.211
That's not another opinion.
That's your opinion.

34:49.830 --> 34:51.296
(car door closes)

34:55.928 --> 34:57.594
-Marcos?
-MARCOS: Mom?

34:57.745 --> 34:58.744
-(Elena crying)
-Mom!

34:58.839 --> 35:02.340
ELENA:
<i> Aye, Dios mio. Mijitos!</i>

35:02.492 --> 35:03.749
SADIE: Her sons.

35:03.827 --> 35:06.520
She told me she hasn't
seen them in over 20 years.

35:10.667 --> 35:12.359
(Elena crying, laughing)

35:14.187 --> 35:16.688
(Elena continues crying)

35:16.764 --> 35:18.598
It's amazing
what can happen

35:18.675 --> 35:21.409
when a family never stops
fighting for each other.

35:24.698 --> 35:26.289
That was subtle.

35:29.611 --> 35:34.214
(light music playing)

35:37.118 --> 35:38.635
(Grace sighs)

35:38.786 --> 35:40.303
GRACE: Oh, come on.

35:40.380 --> 35:41.954
Lord, please,
I just need one bar

35:42.032 --> 35:43.623
to call my husband,
please, Lord.

35:43.642 --> 35:46.309
Ah, well, the cell towers
are down all across the city.

35:46.461 --> 35:48.812
Billy, why are you here still?

35:48.963 --> 35:51.130
Uh, your water just broke?

35:51.208 --> 35:52.407
-We've gotta
get you to the hospital.
-No.

35:52.542 --> 35:54.709
There is no we. Do you wanna
make yourself useful?

35:54.728 --> 35:56.636
Go down to the 122 station house

35:56.713 --> 35:59.230
and please tell my husband
to meet me at the hospital.

35:59.383 --> 36:01.449
BILLY: How are you
planning on gettin' there?

36:02.644 --> 36:04.810
I've been driving
since I was 16, Billy.

36:04.888 --> 36:06.221
I think I got it.

36:06.239 --> 36:08.481
You're gonna drive yourself,
in this weather?

36:08.558 --> 36:09.482
GRACE: Okay.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.576
-Grace--
-(groans)

36:11.653 --> 36:12.836
At least take
a sandwich with you.

36:13.063 --> 36:15.005
GRACE: I hate Muenster.

36:15.114 --> 36:17.382
(wind whistling)

36:18.660 --> 36:20.010
BILLY: Hey, Grace.

36:20.161 --> 36:23.438
Would you just
hang on a damn minute?

36:23.440 --> 36:25.390
Think about
what you're doing, okay?

36:26.760 --> 36:28.185
GRACE:
Billy, close that door.

36:28.261 --> 36:30.002
You're officially
trespassing now.

36:30.022 --> 36:32.096
Grace, you're in
active labor, okay?

36:32.249 --> 36:33.356
You can't be driving yourself
to the hospital.

36:33.433 --> 36:34.582
Watch me.

36:34.584 --> 36:36.100
This thing even have
four-wheel drive?

36:36.253 --> 36:37.360
Look, my truck's right there.

36:37.512 --> 36:38.920
Billy, I wouldn't
get in your truck

36:38.939 --> 36:40.346
if it was the last ride
out of hell.

36:40.365 --> 36:41.756
Now you might wanna step back.

36:41.775 --> 36:43.925
You think I'm gonna tell Judd
I let you roll solo

36:43.944 --> 36:45.017
into a damned white-out?

36:45.111 --> 36:46.778
GRACE:
What are you doing?

36:46.854 --> 36:48.688
You ain't the only crazy one.

36:48.707 --> 36:51.291
You're driving,
I'm riding shotgun.

36:56.790 --> 36:58.197
WOMAN (over radio):
<i> And bundle up, Austin.</i>

36:58.217 --> 37:01.793
<i> No matter how frosty it gets,</i>
<i> we keep it hot on 97.1.</i>

37:01.945 --> 37:04.387
-(Marjan clicks tongue)
<i> -Up next, the OG</i>
<i> heartbreaker himself.</i>

37:04.464 --> 37:07.115
-So how do you wanna do this?
-Do what?

37:07.117 --> 37:08.558
We could drive straight
to headquarters

37:08.635 --> 37:10.376
and you can deliver
your letter of apology

37:10.395 --> 37:11.970
to Billy and be reinstated,

37:12.122 --> 37:14.880
or we could drop
the doggy home first.

37:14.958 --> 37:16.566
What makes you think
I'm going back?

37:16.718 --> 37:18.902
Well, because we're going back,
for instance?

37:19.053 --> 37:20.962
No, no, no.
<i> You're</i> going back.

37:20.964 --> 37:23.147
But you packed up
all your stuff.

37:23.300 --> 37:24.908
Yes, because I need
to stay mobile,

37:25.059 --> 37:26.910
but I don't know
what I'm doing yet,

37:27.137 --> 37:29.412
except giving you
a ride back to town.

37:29.489 --> 37:31.823
Ah. That's it?

37:31.992 --> 37:33.917
You helped me out.
I'm very appreciative.

37:34.068 --> 37:36.311
And I'm gonna make sure
you get home safely.

37:36.313 --> 37:37.921
Hmm. And by "helped you,"

37:37.998 --> 37:40.507
you mean saved you
from being murdered?

37:41.260 --> 37:42.259
Yeah.

37:42.335 --> 37:43.318
Hmm.

37:43.336 --> 37:45.244
In which case,
I think you owe me

37:45.264 --> 37:47.505
more than just a ride.

37:47.657 --> 37:49.841
Cap, you need to sign
that damn apology letter

37:49.917 --> 37:52.844
so that you can become
our cap again,
like we talked about.

37:52.996 --> 37:56.314
Like<i> you</i> talked about.
I didn't say anything except no.

37:57.017 --> 37:58.441
Pretty sure I said no.

37:58.518 --> 38:02.003
Oh, my God.
You are so stubborn.

38:02.005 --> 38:03.947
The universe
is shouting in your ear

38:04.098 --> 38:05.523
and you can't hear a thing.

38:05.600 --> 38:08.176
Well, I hear something.
I hear Tom.

38:08.178 --> 38:10.512
("Breakdown"
by Tom Petty playing)

38:10.530 --> 38:12.289
Ugh!

38:12.365 --> 38:15.417
(Owen singing along):

38:16.944 --> 38:19.963

39:08.162 --> 39:12.182

39:12.258 --> 39:14.225
<i> ♪ It's all right </i>

39:16.930 --> 39:19.064
MARJAN:
I'm still mad at you.

39:21.935 --> 39:24.586
DR. PATEL:
We managed to get his heart
back into rhythm.

39:24.588 --> 39:27.105
Okay, well, that's
good news, right?

39:27.199 --> 39:28.923
DR. PATEL: But his body
is still not compensating.

39:28.942 --> 39:30.200
Compensating for what?

39:30.535 --> 39:33.703
TOMMY:
It means his vital signs
haven't returned to normal.

39:34.264 --> 39:35.430
Yet.

39:35.599 --> 39:37.022
DR. PATEL:
He's been through
a major trauma.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.450
I'm afraid he's on the verge
of multi-system organ failure.

39:39.603 --> 39:41.026
How do you stop that
from happening?

39:41.046 --> 39:42.954
Unfortunately,
there's not much we can do

39:43.106 --> 39:45.364
other than keep him sedated
at this point.

39:45.384 --> 39:47.366
It gives his body
a chance to recover

39:47.444 --> 39:48.534
without additional stress.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.887
CARLOS:
Does that usually work...

39:50.964 --> 39:52.722
for someone in his condition?

39:53.450 --> 39:54.432
It can.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.394
It can.

39:57.545 --> 40:00.713
But realistically speaking,
what are we looking at here?

40:00.790 --> 40:02.214
We're watching his labs closely,

40:02.234 --> 40:05.718
but if they continue
trending down...

40:05.720 --> 40:07.678
We could lose him.

40:07.830 --> 40:10.698
DR. PATEL: I'm sorry
I don't have better news.

40:13.394 --> 40:15.653
NANCY:
<i> Tranquilo.</i> Okay?

40:15.730 --> 40:17.138
TOMMY: We're just...

40:17.140 --> 40:20.375
We're just gonna
keep on praying, okay?

40:22.312 --> 40:23.253
Yeah.

40:23.329 --> 40:25.146
And one thing
we know about TK,

40:25.165 --> 40:27.573
the kid does not know
how to stay down.

40:27.667 --> 40:28.883
She's right about that.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.928
I think I need
to get some fresh air.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.930
-You want someone to come with?
-No.

40:34.081 --> 40:36.099
I think I need to be alone...

40:36.176 --> 40:38.017
for a minute. Thanks.

40:43.442 --> 40:44.691
This sucks.

40:46.427 --> 40:48.445
Yeah. Yeah, it really does.

40:50.765 --> 40:54.025
BILLY:
Yeah, you might wanna
ease up just a skosh.

40:54.177 --> 40:55.618
Conditions being what they are.

40:55.695 --> 40:56.844
Billy, if you keep talking,

40:56.938 --> 40:58.513
you're gonna be walking
in these conditions.

40:58.515 --> 41:00.865
Reckon nobody likes
a backseat driver.

41:00.942 --> 41:02.375
No. Be quiet!

41:03.462 --> 41:04.461
BILLY: Uh...

41:06.113 --> 41:09.023
What you said
about it chafing me to

41:09.025 --> 41:13.970
watch Strand
run the 126 so well, I...

41:14.121 --> 41:15.305
I suppose there's
some truth to that.

41:15.381 --> 41:17.140
Well, at least
you can admit it, Billy.

41:17.258 --> 41:18.866
BILLY: I do think about 'em.

41:18.868 --> 41:21.052
Judd and...

41:21.204 --> 41:23.387
all my fallen brothers
from the 126.

41:23.464 --> 41:26.374
I see their faces every night.

41:26.392 --> 41:29.134
Never stop thinking about 'em.

41:29.212 --> 41:30.561
(winces, groans)

41:30.563 --> 41:31.713
(shouting)

41:31.715 --> 41:32.822
Hey, hey, hey. You okay?

41:33.049 --> 41:34.640
-(groans)
-Here, squeeze my hand.

41:34.718 --> 41:35.717
-Don't-don't touch me.
-Squeeze my hand.

41:35.735 --> 41:37.994
Don't touch me, Billy.
Are we clear?

41:38.071 --> 41:40.145
You are not a friend.
You are not family.

41:40.165 --> 41:42.406
You are a man
who jumped in my car.

41:42.559 --> 41:45.126
-Are we clear?
-Yeah.

41:47.339 --> 41:48.421
(sighs)

41:50.675 --> 41:52.258
What is this?

41:54.921 --> 41:56.571
BILLY:
They look abandoned.

41:56.589 --> 41:58.515
Folks must have bailed
when the storm hit.

41:58.666 --> 42:00.016
Um, it's-it's okay.

42:00.093 --> 42:02.301
-We can just double back,
take Mopac.
-Mm-mmm

42:02.412 --> 42:03.853
BILLY:
Get to the hospital
from Birchwood.

42:03.930 --> 42:05.429
That's gonna take
too long, Billy.

42:05.582 --> 42:06.189
I'm going around.

42:06.340 --> 42:08.358
-(thuds)
-Ah... (gasps)

42:12.438 --> 42:13.321
Put it in reverse.

42:14.199 --> 42:15.365
That's it, nice and easy.

42:16.535 --> 42:17.867
Ugh! No.

42:18.019 --> 42:19.410
Damn it!

42:23.375 --> 42:24.707
(sighs)

42:25.377 --> 42:27.769
We're stuck.
