14:16.314 --> 14:17.679
Come up here.

14:21.652 --> 14:24.029
You need to stop questioning
your mother.

14:24.238 --> 14:28.902
You let Ethan get away. Now you need
to help us clean this mess up.

14:29.077 --> 14:31.113
Do you understand?

14:32.413 --> 14:34.153
Sorry, Dad.

14:35.541 --> 14:39.409
It's me, again. Where are you?
Please call me when you get this.

14:39.587 --> 14:43.296
Mr. Linley, this is Agent Navabi.
You need to come with us.

14:43.466 --> 14:45.582
-Why? Is something wrong?
-Noah Shuster.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.671
I don't know who that is.
What's going on?

14:47.845 --> 14:50.712
He was the adoption agent that you
and your wife met about Ethan.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.721
The day after he disappeared,
$25,000...

14:52.892 --> 14:54.928
...from your account
was transferred to his.

14:55.103 --> 14:57.094

-Come with us.

She was going out for coffee.

She hasn't come back.
Now you want me to leave Ethan alone?

15:03.027 --> 15:04.688
-He'll be taken care of.

15:18.126 --> 15:19.866
How do you feel about waffles?

15:25.466 --> 15:30.210
Ugh. No toaster, no microwave.
No problem. No problem.

15:32.014 --> 15:35.677
I know, the whole idea that Mozart
will improve cognitive skills is a myth...

15:35.852 --> 15:38.218
...but they say babies start learning
in the womb...

15:38.396 --> 15:41.433

LIZ: I want him gone.
-He's here for your protection.

17:35.638 --> 17:38.380
I don't want his protection any more
than I want your money.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.971
RAYMOND: The money isn't for you.
LIZ: It's very generous.

17:42.144 --> 17:45.887
I can appreciate that it comes
from a place of concern.

17:46.232 --> 17:49.520
But it's dirty money,
and ljust don't want it. I don't need it.

17:49.694 --> 17:53.027
No, but your child does.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.526
I'm giving my child up for adoption.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.775
Why would you do that?

17:59.996 --> 18:03.113
How can you, of all people,
ask me that question?

18:03.291 --> 18:06.374
The life I have because of you
is no place for a child.

18:06.544 --> 18:07.579
I can't even make a waffle...

18:07.753 --> 18:10.620
...without one of your people bursting
into my home with a gun.

18:15.303 --> 18:19.467
You think your life is too dangerous
for a child.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.560
But what is your life without one?

18:27.565 --> 18:31.308
I can tell you from personal experience,
not much.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.062
What?

18:36.824 --> 18:39.236
You and Tom agree on something.

18:39.702 --> 18:41.863
He wants you to keep the baby?

18:42.079 --> 18:43.740
Oh, yeah.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.708
Oh, my God. That's it.

18:50.338 --> 18:53.080
The key to these abductions
is parental consent.

18:53.257 --> 18:56.215
No child can be adopted out
without both parents agreeing.

18:56.427 --> 18:59.043
So I had Aram look over
Noah Shuster's case files.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.052
There were 93 cases,
including Ethan's...

19:01.223 --> 19:03.509
...where parents considered adoption,
then backed out.

19:03.684 --> 19:07.427
Of those, 16 kids died or went missing
within a year of the visit.

19:07.605 --> 19:11.564
Sixteen kids with cognitive, physical,
or psychological issues.

19:11.734 --> 19:15.397
According to Ethan's father,
adoption was his mother's idea.

19:15.571 --> 19:18.278
He was working extra shifts to pay for
Ethan's private school and therapy...

19:18.449 --> 19:19.689
...Ieaving her alone with him.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.650
He was trying
to appease his wife by meeting Shuster...

19:22.828 --> 19:24.784
...but he never wanted
to go through with it.

19:24.955 --> 19:28.038
Conveniently for him, she's not around
to challenge his side of things.

19:28.209 --> 19:30.621
No, but she had access
to a personal trust account...

19:30.795 --> 19:32.786
...from which she transferred money
to Shuster.

19:32.963 --> 19:35.705
She could've paid him off,
and he could've taken her to cover it up.

19:35.883 --> 19:39.501
I think Lady Ambrosia's using Shuster
to identify mothers and fathers...

19:39.679 --> 19:41.385
...who wanna get rid of their kids...

19:41.555 --> 19:43.807
.ubutcant
because their spouses won't consent.

19:43.974 --> 19:46.260
I searched the national
child-identification program...

19:46.435 --> 19:49.677
...and of the prints lifted
from the finger-paint on Ethan's body...

19:49.855 --> 19:52.062
...seven belong to that group
of missing children.

19:52.233 --> 19:53.894
We need to find this Noah Shuster...

19:54.068 --> 19:56.810
...and figure out
where this city of lost kids is.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.022
You lied to me!

19:58.197 --> 20:01.735
We had a deal:
Two ladies for you, one address for me.

20:01.909 --> 20:05.401
Ladies, the kind that walk on two legs,
preferably hairless.

20:05.579 --> 20:07.365
I want the address.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.997
You think it's funny? Little dogs?

20:10.209 --> 20:13.076
I thought they'd be a nice gesture.
I thought you'd like them.

20:13.254 --> 20:15.586
-I don't like them.
-Maybe you're afraid they won't like you.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.257
Dogs are very intuitive.

20:17.425 --> 20:20.758
-They'll know if you're hiding something.
-I am hiding something.

20:20.928 --> 20:23.544
-I hate dogs.
-They're homeless.

Foot whipping, hung by our wrists,
electric shock.

25:05.170 --> 25:09.004

than a groaning heap in the corner.

she wanted him back.

-And I shot him.
-It was an accident.
