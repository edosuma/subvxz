...and we thought
maybe you could cheer him up.

13:35.831 --> 13:37.731
With sex.

13:39.635 --> 13:41.125
I think she knows what I meant.

13:41.303 --> 13:43.203
How can she
when you beat around the bush?

13:43.372 --> 13:46.864
She's from the mean streets, where
they shoot from the hip and keep it real.

13:47.943 --> 13:50.844
Don't worry,
I can take good care of your friend.

13:51.013 --> 13:53.811
Okay, terrific. Um....

13:53.983 --> 13:59.615
Listen, is there a way that we can do this
where he doesn't know that you're a....

13:59.788 --> 14:02.256
- You know....
- A prostitute.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.753
You want the girlfriend experience.

14:05.194 --> 14:08.186
Yes, yes. Exactly.
The girlfriend experience.

14:08.364 --> 14:10.229
Actually, if it's not too much to ask...

14:10.399 --> 14:13.800
...could we have
the Jewish girlfriend experience?

14:15.704 --> 14:18.434
Okay, that's question 20.
You have to guess.

14:20.576 --> 14:22.407
I don't know, Sheldon.

14:22.578 --> 14:24.978
Are you <i>Star Wars?</i>

14:26.248 --> 14:29.684
How can one person be a whole movie?

14:30.152 --> 14:32.780
Okay, I give up.
Can we just do something else?

14:32.955 --> 14:34.286
Fine.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.515
I was Spock.

14:41.063 --> 14:43.657
Are you and Leonard
friends with benefits?

14:44.400 --> 14:45.628
What?

14:45.801 --> 14:47.860
Are you and Leonard
friends with benefits?

14:48.037 --> 14:49.436
Where did that even come from?

14:49.605 --> 14:51.732
- Did he say we were?
- No, Leonard said nothing.

14:51.907 --> 14:56.037
But who knows what goes on over here when
he pretends your mail was misdelivered?

14:57.346 --> 14:59.211
Just mail, no benefits.

14:59.882 --> 15:01.213
I see.

15:01.383 --> 15:03.010
Why are you asking?

15:03.185 --> 15:06.018
I'm curious about
the whole social construct.

15:06.188 --> 15:10.147
On its face,
the idea of satisfying one's sexual appetite--

15:10.326 --> 15:12.157
Assuming one is afflicted with such.

15:12.328 --> 15:16.697
--without emotional entanglement,
that seems imminently practical.

15:16.865 --> 15:22.326
What I've observed, however,
is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl.

15:23.606 --> 15:26.507
Well, some people just can't handle
that kind of relationship.

15:27.443 --> 15:29.172
Can you?

15:31.180 --> 15:32.613
Excuse me?

15:33.048 --> 15:37.417
Are you able to have sex with men without
developing an emotional attachment?

15:37.586 --> 15:42.080
Sheldon, I really don't wanna
talk about this with you.

15:42.257 --> 15:44.282
Is this conversation
making you uncomfortable?

15:44.460 --> 15:46.894
Of course it's making me uncomfortable.
Can't you tell?

15:47.062 --> 15:48.461
I really have no idea.

15:48.631 --> 15:51.395
I don't particularly excel
at reading facial expressions--

15:51.567 --> 15:53.899
I'm uncomfortable, Sheldon!

15:55.471 --> 15:57.735
Thank you, that's very helpful.

16:00.409 --> 16:03.071
All right,
where are these amazing shrimp?

16:03.812 --> 16:05.279
Behold.

16:07.383 --> 16:11.217
Seriously?
You think this is the size of a baby's arm?

16:12.154 --> 16:14.054
A little baby.

16:15.124 --> 16:16.386
I'm going back to the room.

16:16.925 --> 16:20.452
Boy, would it maybe kill them
to put out a nice brisket?

16:31.407 --> 16:34.638
Hi, there. Howard Wolowitz.

16:34.810 --> 16:36.801
Ester Rosenblatt.

16:43.085 --> 16:46.919
I don't think the manager's coming tonight,
so here.

16:47.089 --> 16:50.081
Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch?

16:50.259 --> 16:52.887
Well, it wasn't the first suggestion
that came to mind...

16:53.062 --> 16:54.859
...but it's the one I'm going with.

16:55.531 --> 16:58.364
I can't sleep on your couch.
I sleep in a bed.

16:58.534 --> 17:01.196
Given its dimensions,
I have no intention of living out...

17:01.370 --> 17:05.101
...E.M. Snickering's beloved children's book,
<i>The Tall Man From Cornwall.</i>

17:06.474 --> 17:08.032
What?

17:08.444 --> 17:12.073
<i>There was a tall man from Cornwall</i>
<i>Whose length exceeded his bed</i>

17:12.247 --> 17:17.116
<i>My body fits on it, but barely upon it</i>
<i>There's no room for my big Cornish head</i>

17:22.724 --> 17:23.749
[SIGHS]

17:23.925 --> 17:26.986
All right, I will give you my bed
on one condition.

17:27.162 --> 17:30.723
That you promise to zip your hole
for the next eight hours.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.963
- May I say one last thing?
- Only if it doesn't rhyme.

17:37.072 --> 17:38.801
All right.

17:42.845 --> 17:44.608
Good night.

17:47.683 --> 17:50.151
Turn-ons, let me see.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.651
Reading a good book in front of the fire...

17:52.821 --> 17:54.982
...long walks on the beach...

17:55.157 --> 17:59.321
...and getting freaky on the Sabbath
with a bacon cheeseburger.

18:02.731 --> 18:05.495
Really? Me too.

18:07.202 --> 18:09.762
<i>Oy gevalt,</i> you're hot.

18:11.073 --> 18:12.802
Yeah.

18:13.242 --> 18:15.233
Excuse me for a moment.

18:19.114 --> 18:22.515
- Hey. How's it going?
- Cut the crap. You set this up, didn't you?

18:23.886 --> 18:26.081
- Yes.
- She's a hooker, isn't she?

18:26.922 --> 18:29.117
A prostitute, yes.

18:30.459 --> 18:33.223
- And you already gave her the money?
- Yes.

18:34.296 --> 18:36.025
Thank you.

18:43.071 --> 18:44.663
Penny?

18:46.675 --> 18:48.267
What?

18:48.610 --> 18:50.669
I can't sleep.

18:51.380 --> 18:54.975
Maybe that's because
your hole is still open.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.250
I'm homesick.

18:59.721 --> 19:02.485
Your home is 20 feet from here.

19:02.658 --> 19:05.684
Twenty feet, 20 light years.
It doesn't matter.

19:06.195 --> 19:09.062
It's in a galaxy far, far away.

19:10.365 --> 19:12.026
Damn it.

19:15.270 --> 19:17.500
What do you want me to do?

19:18.207 --> 19:20.698
Sing "Soft Kitty."

19:22.511 --> 19:24.775
That's only for when you're sick.

19:26.315 --> 19:29.478
Homesick is a type of being sick.

19:32.254 --> 19:35.246
Come on, do I really have to?

19:35.424 --> 19:37.585
I suppose we can stay up and talk.

19:39.895 --> 19:42.329

Thank you for letting me stay here.

20:24.206 --> 20:27.198
Oh. You're welcome, sweetie.

20:31.113 --> 20:33.547
Okay, I'm sleepy now. Get out.

20:43.825 --> 20:46.692
Oh, good, you're finally home.

20:46.862 --> 20:48.557
What were you doing at Penny's?

20:48.730 --> 20:52.666
Well, we had dinner, played some games,
and then I spent the night.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.062
Oh.

20:54.236 --> 20:57.467
