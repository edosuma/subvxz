WEBVTT

00:06.673 --> 00:08.633
Mm, it's good.

00:08.717 --> 00:10.176
Yeah, yeah, it is.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.888
(moaning)

00:13.972 --> 00:15.265
(clears throat)

00:15.348 --> 00:18.476
Oh, you've got a little
something right there.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.145
{\an3}Oh, thanks.

00:21.062 --> 00:23.440
Mmm, that looks delicious.

00:23.523 --> 00:24.941
Here you go.

00:25.024 --> 00:26.276
{\an3}Thank you.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.069
Um...

00:28.153 --> 00:30.280
{\an1}So, did you really
like the movie?

00:30.363 --> 00:33.283
Yeah, yeah. You know,
I, uh, (clears throat)

00:33.366 --> 00:34.826
thought it was
romantic, yeah.

00:39.539 --> 00:42.292
We should get the check.
Yeah, yeah, I will.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.626
It's just...
I'll do that.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.587
(both clear throat)

00:48.423 --> 00:50.341
Uh, excuse me.

00:50.425 --> 00:51.509
Noah Hunter?

00:51.593 --> 00:53.470
{\an3}Yeah, it's me. What
can I do for you?

00:53.553 --> 00:55.221
My name is Jeannine Stein.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.806
If this is a bad time...

00:56.890 --> 00:58.308
{\an1}No. This is, uh, Donna
and this is Kelly.

00:58.391 --> 01:00.018
{\an3}Hi.
Oh, please sit down.

01:00.101 --> 01:02.187
Oh, thanks.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.480
I'll get right to the point.

01:04.563 --> 01:06.816
I run a restaurant called
the Scarlet Moon.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.818
{\an3}In Santa Monica.
Yeah, love that place.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.321
I want to open a second
restaurant in Beverly Hills.

01:11.404 --> 01:12.489
Right here.

01:12.572 --> 01:14.491
Here?

01:14.574 --> 01:15.867
You want to replace
the Peach Pit?

01:15.950 --> 01:17.160
I understand the lease is up.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.036
Since you own the building...

01:18.119 --> 01:20.330
{\an3}Yeah, but the man
that runs the place,

01:20.413 --> 01:21.831
{\an3}he's a really
good friend of ours.

01:21.915 --> 01:25.376
I, uh, have a proposal.

01:26.586 --> 01:29.672
If you want to hear it,
give me a call.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.216
{\an3}(scoffs)

01:31.299 --> 01:32.842
Sell Nat out?

01:32.926 --> 01:34.552
Like that'll ever happen.

01:37.305 --> 01:39.516
(lively chatter)

01:39.599 --> 01:41.601
(dance music playing)

01:45.355 --> 01:46.397
I can't just ditch work.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.900
Your movie premieres tonight.

01:48.983 --> 01:50.652
{\an1}It's a low-budget
slasher movie

01:50.735 --> 01:52.362
I interned on doing makeup.

01:52.445 --> 01:54.030
It's your first screen credit.
It's a big deal.

01:54.113 --> 01:55.573
Ay-yi-yi.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.367
{\an1}The cleaning service
will be very impressed.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.661
(sighs)
What time does the movie start?

01:59.744 --> 02:01.704
In a half an hour, but I...

02:01.788 --> 02:03.414
A half an hour?
There's plenty of time.

02:03.498 --> 02:05.375
Are you kidding me,
a half an hour?

02:05.458 --> 02:07.252
I have to clean the club, okay?

02:07.335 --> 02:09.878
That's fine; you can
clean it afterwards.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.506
My boss checks in at 4:00.

02:11.589 --> 02:13.424
I can't go the movie

02:13.508 --> 02:14.926
and have this place
done by then.

02:15.009 --> 02:16.261
Maybe you can't, but <i> we</i> can.

02:16.344 --> 02:18.137
You're going to help me?

02:18.221 --> 02:20.390
{\an3}Mm-hmm, sure.
With a mop?

02:20.473 --> 02:22.350
Like I said, you're on your own.

02:22.433 --> 02:23.434
(laughing)

02:23.518 --> 02:26.104
Come on, it'll be fun.

02:28.648 --> 02:29.649
Tonight was great.

02:29.732 --> 02:31.776
Yeah, yeah, it was great.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.236
{\an3}See you guys back
at the house?

02:33.319 --> 02:37.365
{\an1}The house? Yeah, I mean,
we will-- the house.

02:37.448 --> 02:39.367
Sure.

02:39.450 --> 02:42.203
{\an3}Uh, look, you, uh--
we don't have to

02:42.287 --> 02:43.746
{\an3}go home together
if you don't want to.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.124
{\an1}Kelly, it's just
the stuff with Lauren,

02:46.207 --> 02:47.876
{\an1}it's a little
fresh, you know?

02:47.959 --> 02:50.378
Yeah, I know.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.424
So, do you think you can wait?

02:54.507 --> 02:55.800
Till it's not?

02:55.884 --> 02:57.927
I could try.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.096
Well, that's something.

04:50.957 --> 04:51.708
{\an3}I'm sure I told you
about her.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.209
No, I don't think so.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.921
Top ten restaurants,
beaches, boutiques.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.756
I hired Pia to get us
on that list.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.174
You already hired her?

05:00.258 --> 05:01.801
{\an1}You were busy
with the fall line.

05:01.884 --> 05:03.052
I didn't want to bother you.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.387
Oh.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.014
I'm... I'm sure
it'll be fine.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.849
But you're not happy about it?

05:07.932 --> 05:10.727
No, it's, it's just I wish we
would've talked about it first.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.520
I mean, we are partners.

05:12.603 --> 05:14.731
Well, you didn't talk to me
about the fall line.

05:14.814 --> 05:15.940
That's completely different.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.191
That's a creative decision.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.153
It is.

05:20.236 --> 05:22.196
She's...
Here she comes.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.865
Just hear her out okay?

05:23.948 --> 05:24.907
Sorry I'm late.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.784
Drug rumors involving a client.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.745
Major star.
Very hush-hush.

05:28.828 --> 05:29.704
Pia, this is Donna.

05:29.787 --> 05:30.580
{\an3}Donna, this is Pia.
Hi.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.458
Skybar, Barfly,
I put them on the map.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.793
Do what I say
and I'll do the same for you.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.920
Sounds good.

05:39.964 --> 05:41.966
(singsongy):
Hey, Janet!

05:42.050 --> 05:43.217
There you are!

05:43.301 --> 05:44.969
{\an1}Oh, listen up,
I've had a brainstorm.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.763
{\an3}Sit down, take two
aspirin, it'll pass.

05:46.846 --> 05:49.057
Very funny, listen, do you know
what the day after tomorrow is?

05:49.140 --> 05:50.266
I'm not listening.

05:50.349 --> 05:51.601
{\an1}(with thick accent):
It's St. Patrick's day!

05:51.684 --> 05:52.810
{\an1}We're talking shamrocks.
We're talking beer.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.437
We're talking
leprechauns.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.438
Leprechauns?

05:55.521 --> 05:56.773
Now I'm really
not listening.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.608
{\an1}Legend has it,
if you find a leprechaun,

05:58.691 --> 05:59.776
you get a pot of gold.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.778
{\an3}I'm sorry, did you
say something?

06:01.861 --> 06:04.155
{\an1}All we have to do is remind
the people of the legend

06:04.238 --> 06:06.699
{\an1}and then run a picture
of a leprechaun.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.242
LOU:
Hey, anybody work here?

06:08.326 --> 06:09.452
{\an6}STEVE:
Then we report
a few sightings

06:09.535 --> 06:12.955
{\an3}and faster than you can say
manly yes, but I like it, too,

06:13.039 --> 06:14.957
{\an3}papers will fly
out of the newsstands.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.918
Yeah, along with whatever
reputation we have left.

06:17.001 --> 06:19.504
Lou, say hello to Janet.

06:19.587 --> 06:22.632
Janet say hello to our
leprechaun of Beverly Hills.

06:22.715 --> 06:23.633
Hey, pleased to meet you.

06:23.716 --> 06:24.926
Hi.

06:25.009 --> 06:27.929
(Irish jig playing)

06:28.012 --> 06:29.931
(birds chirping)

06:31.724 --> 06:33.476
{\an3}Oh, hey.
(laughing)

06:33.559 --> 06:34.811
{\an1}What's up?

06:34.894 --> 06:36.270
Uh, me, but just barely.

06:36.354 --> 06:37.980
Uh, well, it's 11:30.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.440
Must be nice to be you.

06:39.524 --> 06:40.441
Well, sometimes.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.527
You, uh, you ever
get the urge

06:42.610 --> 06:43.986
to do something
completely worthless?

06:44.070 --> 06:45.029
{\an3}Of course.
(giggling)

06:45.113 --> 06:46.531
Something so utterly decadent

06:46.614 --> 06:47.824
{\an1}that you're ashamed
to tell people about it?

06:47.907 --> 06:49.784
{\an1}Decadent?
Mm-hmm.

06:49.867 --> 06:52.328
Wow, that's such a big word
for you to use.

06:52.411 --> 06:54.122
Is this the reason why you
asked me to rush over here?

06:54.205 --> 06:55.790
Are you feeling really decadent?

06:55.873 --> 06:58.459
Completely.

07:00.795 --> 07:03.339
You know I was
with a client, right?

07:03.422 --> 07:05.675
Yeah, that's the point.

07:05.758 --> 07:08.845
Oh, right, that's the point that
I always sacrifice for you.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.346
That's so shocking.

07:10.429 --> 07:11.681
No, see, honestly,
I figured we would

07:11.764 --> 07:13.683
{\an1}take a drive
up the coast, you know,

07:13.766 --> 07:15.518
{\an1}maybe take a hike
into the mountains.

07:15.601 --> 07:18.729
Hey, did you know
that normal people work?

07:18.813 --> 07:20.523
Did you know that?

07:20.606 --> 07:22.900
Uh, not if they don't have to.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.987
Which is, you know...
Right. Well, I just think

07:26.070 --> 07:29.115
everyone should work, you know?

07:29.198 --> 07:32.743
If not for the money,
then for the... self-respect.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.537
Now, for the sake of argument,
we're just gonna pretend

07:34.620 --> 07:36.831
that what you said,
uh, hurt me.

07:36.914 --> 07:38.875
Okay.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.252
{\an1}It didn't.

07:41.335 --> 07:43.713
But can't we still just go?
(groans)

07:43.796 --> 07:45.339
Hey, have a great day together?

07:45.423 --> 07:49.093
Dylan, I have
three more clients.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.889
I'll be done at 5:00.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.600
If you still want to hang out
then, I'm available.

07:55.683 --> 07:58.019
This is a really beautiful hike.

07:58.102 --> 07:59.729
Well, if it's such a
beautiful hike,

07:59.812 --> 08:01.522
then why don't you just
take it by yourself?

08:01.606 --> 08:02.899
You know, maybe it'll
give you time to figure out

08:02.982 --> 08:04.275
{\an3}what you want to do
with your life.

08:04.358 --> 08:05.860
Yeah, what you want me
to do with my life.

08:05.943 --> 08:08.696
That's not what I just said!

08:08.779 --> 08:10.448
It's what you meant.
Why is it...

08:10.531 --> 08:12.533
Why is it that you
just can't be happy

08:12.617 --> 08:14.452
for one second?

08:14.535 --> 08:16.454
I mean, I don't even believe
that anyone can be happy

08:16.537 --> 08:18.539
without any direction
in their life, and you

08:18.623 --> 08:20.875
have the least amount of
direction of anyone I know.

08:24.962 --> 08:26.756
{\an5}NOAH:
Why don't we,
uh, grab a seat here?

08:26.839 --> 08:29.091
As you know,
Mr. Hunter...

08:29.175 --> 08:31.093
{\an1}It's, uh, Noah.
I mean, Noah's fine.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.260
Noah, right.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.554
As you know, Noah,

08:33.638 --> 08:35.097
my bank holds the mortgage
on the club.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.265
And I'm a couple of payments
behind, I know.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.601
Three to be exact.

08:38.683 --> 08:41.437
Now, my bank...
Wants their payments,

08:41.520 --> 08:42.563
and they're gonna get it.

08:42.647 --> 08:43.731
When?

08:43.813 --> 08:45.608
Soon.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.610
Could you be
a little more specific?

08:47.693 --> 08:49.403
Listen, Don.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.323
The club business runs a little
hot and cold, you know?

08:52.406 --> 08:54.283
And right now, well,
it's a little cold.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.117
I'm sure that's true, but...

08:55.201 --> 08:56.494
{\an1}Plus a few bands
just canceled on me.

08:56.577 --> 08:57.662
And right there that set me back

08:57.745 --> 08:58.913
at least a few payments.

08:58.996 --> 09:00.039
{\an3}I'm sure that's
true, Mr. Hunter,

09:00.122 --> 09:02.500
but my manager needs something
a little more specific.

09:02.583 --> 09:06.921
Okay, Don, um, what if
I can't be more specific here?

09:09.257 --> 09:11.342
We'll have to foreclose.

09:18.015 --> 09:19.517
{\an3}We're getting married
in a month.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.810
Congratulations.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.020
I hope you'll both
be very happy.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.480
We met on the trading floor.

09:24.563 --> 09:26.983
{\an3}He was selling bonds
and I was buying.

09:27.066 --> 09:27.984
{\an1}Mmm.

09:28.067 --> 09:31.028
{\an1}It was just like
this perfect match, you know?

09:31.112 --> 09:32.947
Has been ever since.

09:35.616 --> 09:36.617
Well, that's great.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.160
Um, so, what can I do for you?

09:38.244 --> 09:41.664
We want you to draw up
a prenuptial agreement.

09:41.747 --> 09:44.500
Oh. Why, if you don't mind
my asking?

09:44.583 --> 09:45.501
We're brokers.

09:45.584 --> 09:46.961
{\an1}We protect
against the downside.

09:47.044 --> 09:48.337
That's what we do.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.840
Well, of course what you do
is your business,

09:50.923 --> 09:54.635
but in my experience, uh,
marriage isn't like trading.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.178
You know, you can't
hedge your position.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.513
Sure you can.

09:57.596 --> 09:59.724
{\an3}And we want you
to help us do it.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.108
Mmm, this is ready.

10:09.191 --> 10:10.359
{\an3}When's Donna
supposed to be here?

10:10.443 --> 10:12.069
{\an1}Um, I don't know.
She said she needed

10:12.153 --> 10:14.447
{\an1}some time to think over
the whole publicist thing.

10:14.530 --> 10:16.490
{\an3}Yeah, what's to
think about?

10:16.574 --> 10:17.700
{\an3}It's sounds like
a good idea.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.201
Yeah, well, I think it is,

10:19.285 --> 10:21.495
but apparently
she is reluctant.

10:23.914 --> 10:29.211
{\an1}Oh. Is it because
it's your idea?

10:30.171 --> 10:32.340
Why would that be the case?

10:32.423 --> 10:34.216
{\an1}Well, it shouldn't
be the case, but maybe

10:34.300 --> 10:37.386
the only contribution of yours
that she feels comfortable with

10:37.470 --> 10:40.389
is you folding her T-shirts.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.391
(door opens, footfalls)

10:42.475 --> 10:44.226
(door closes)

10:44.310 --> 10:45.311
Hey, sorry I'm late.

10:45.394 --> 10:47.813
Ooh, smells good.
What are you guys cooking up?

10:48.814 --> 10:50.566
Hi.
Hey.

10:50.649 --> 10:56.530
{\an3}So, did you, um, think
about Pia at all?

10:56.614 --> 10:59.742
I did and, um...
and I don't think

10:59.825 --> 11:02.119
we should hire her,
and I know you disagree

11:02.203 --> 11:03.913
but I just feel
the store is doing well.

11:03.996 --> 11:07.416
Yeah, sure, it's doing great.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.085
Your designs are selling.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.253
{\an3}I'm sure it's all very
rewarding for you,

11:11.337 --> 11:12.588
but it's not for me.

11:12.671 --> 11:14.090
Well, we're in this together.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.966
It's just, I handle
the design end.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.551
You handle the business end.

11:17.635 --> 11:20.221
Which amounts to little more
than cashing out the register

11:20.304 --> 11:21.263
at the end of the night.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.932
{\an3}Donna, I want to
do more than

11:23.015 --> 11:25.393
folding your T-shirts.

11:27.353 --> 11:30.940
{\an1}Okay, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.441
I just--

11:32.525 --> 11:34.777
{\an1}I don't think that hiring
a publicist is the solution.

11:34.860 --> 11:37.113
What possible harm could it do?

11:37.196 --> 11:39.115
Well, she could promise more
than we can deliver.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.449
She could raise expectations.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.284
All of which we can fulfill.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.495
So you're gonna hire her even
though I don't approve, right?

11:46.539 --> 11:47.790
I handle the business end.

11:47.873 --> 11:48.958
Remember?

11:49.041 --> 11:51.961
Pia is strictly business.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.422
If you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go give her a call

11:54.505 --> 11:56.090
and let her know that she's set.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.219
{\an3}Oh, sorry.

12:02.012 --> 12:03.973
Look, I know this is
none of my business,

12:04.056 --> 12:05.766
but it kind of sounds to me

12:05.850 --> 12:08.811
like this publicist doesn't
really appreciate your work.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.191
So, I don't get it.

12:14.275 --> 12:17.319
I mean if-if Kelly still
wants to use her--

12:17.403 --> 12:18.821
I mean doesn't
that make you

12:18.904 --> 12:22.074
wonder whether or not she really
appreciates it either?

12:29.623 --> 12:31.625
(sighs)

12:31.709 --> 12:34.128
{\an6}DAVID:
After seeing the movie
two nights in a row,

12:34.211 --> 12:35.379
I actually thought
it was pretty good.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.298
It was.
(laughing): Oh, awful.

12:37.381 --> 12:38.132
{\an3}No, it was,
I mean, okay,

12:38.215 --> 12:39.675
{\an5}the acting was
all right.
Yeah.

12:39.758 --> 12:40.676
The directing, eh...

12:40.759 --> 12:42.970
{\an3}And the writing and
the cinematography and...

12:43.053 --> 12:45.347
{\an4}(with thick accent):
Uh, yeah, but the...
the makeup...

12:45.431 --> 12:46.223
The makeup.
Did you see-- oh.

12:46.307 --> 12:48.225
It was superb.
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:48.309 --> 12:50.227
the Oscar goes to...

12:50.311 --> 12:52.021
{\an3}David Silver.
No.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.564
{\an3}For best actor in a
supporting role.

12:53.647 --> 12:54.482
Will you stop?

12:54.565 --> 12:56.025
{\an1}(normal voice):
Hey, I'm not acting, okay?

12:56.108 --> 12:57.359
I'm being serious.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.195
Maybe, but...

12:59.278 --> 13:01.030
{\an1}This is you?
Yeah.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.031
Hmm.

13:02.114 --> 13:05.242
{\an3}But the support is very
much appreciated.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.244
{\an3}Yeah.
Thank you.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.371
(moans)

13:16.086 --> 13:18.005
I should go.

13:18.088 --> 13:19.340
Yeah.

13:19.423 --> 13:23.427
{\an1}I mean, unless you don't
think I should go, then...

13:28.974 --> 13:30.851
No, I-- you should go.
I should?

13:30.935 --> 13:32.561
Okay. Okay, well,
Okay.

13:32.645 --> 13:33.479
all righty. Bye.

13:33.562 --> 13:34.396
Bye.

13:35.439 --> 13:37.316
Are you seeing someone else?

13:37.399 --> 13:38.776
David.

13:38.859 --> 13:39.860
Sorry, I just-- I, uh, you know,

13:39.944 --> 13:42.696
I feel like things are going
really good with us.

13:42.780 --> 13:43.906
Me, too.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.741
Good, good.

13:45.824 --> 13:47.743
{\an3}That's what makes
this so frustrating.

13:47.826 --> 13:49.370
I'm moving.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.914
You're moving? Why?

13:51.997 --> 13:54.750
Because my visa expired ,and...

13:54.833 --> 13:56.835
I have to leave the country.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.096
(overlapping chatter)

14:07.179 --> 14:09.181
♪ ♪

14:15.813 --> 14:18.649
Hey, I got your message.

14:18.732 --> 14:21.735
There's something
you should know, okay?

14:21.819 --> 14:22.778
Nat's a friend of mine.

14:22.861 --> 14:25.614
So, you're keeping him
and the low rent he pays?

14:25.698 --> 14:27.324
You want a drink?

14:27.408 --> 14:29.827
Not if it comes in a Save The
Peach Pit commemorative mug.

14:30.869 --> 14:32.955
And if I've reconsidered?

14:33.038 --> 14:34.623
You're gonna close the diner?

14:36.709 --> 14:38.669
If the price is right.

14:38.752 --> 14:42.590
{\an1}Then I'll celebrate
with a martini.

14:42.673 --> 14:43.674
One martini, coming right up.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.021
Oh, man, this is
gonna be great.

14:57.104 --> 14:58.647
{\an1}Here come some people.
Are we all clear?

14:58.731 --> 15:00.149
{\an1}Unfortunately.
All right,

15:00.232 --> 15:03.152
Lou, here's some
chocolate coins.

15:03.235 --> 15:04.653
{\an3}All you have to do is...
Toss them around

15:04.737 --> 15:05.321
while running past the crowd
like a moron.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.530
Right, I'll follow after,

15:06.614 --> 15:08.490
letting everyone know there's
been a leprechaun sighting.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.034
{\an3}While I stay behind,
documenting

15:10.117 --> 15:12.161
this embarrassment
for posterity.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.079
We publish your fine example
of photojournalism

15:14.163 --> 15:16.165
{\an1}in this afternoon's special
edition of the newspaper,

15:16.248 --> 15:18.000
and faster than you can say

15:18.083 --> 15:19.001
(with Irish accent):
they're magically delicious...

15:19.084 --> 15:21.170
Irish Anti-Defamation League
will be picketing

15:21.253 --> 15:22.796
outside our office.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.883
Okay, Lou, you're up.

15:26.884 --> 15:28.135
{\an1}Lou?

15:28.218 --> 15:30.179
You know,
it just occurred to me

15:30.262 --> 15:32.181
that I'm not getting paid
nearly enough for this.

15:32.264 --> 15:33.682
{\an3}Lou, the people, the people.
I mean,

15:33.766 --> 15:34.892
{\an1}to get dressed up
like a freak?

15:34.975 --> 15:36.685
Maybe.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.729
But to run through the streets
like this being chased

15:38.812 --> 15:41.023
by every shopaholic
on Rodeo Drive?

15:41.106 --> 15:43.317
I don't think so.
Well, that's that.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.860
Ah, I'll give you an extra 50.

15:44.943 --> 15:46.111
Don't insult the man.
All right,

15:46.195 --> 15:47.029
make it 75.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.030
He wouldn't think of it.

15:48.113 --> 15:48.947
A C-note.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.033
Plus a kiss from hot lips
over there.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.243
You should be ashamed.

15:54.161 --> 15:55.204
Thank you.

15:55.287 --> 15:55.871
Two hundred.

15:55.954 --> 15:57.206
Done.

15:57.289 --> 16:00.042
(Irish jig playing)

16:01.085 --> 16:03.003
{\an1}(laughs)

16:03.087 --> 16:04.797
Oh, this is good.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.048
{\an1}(sighs)

16:06.131 --> 16:09.176
You know, just when I thought
you couldn't sink any lower.

16:09.259 --> 16:11.261
(with Irish accent):
Don't forget to zoom in, lassie.

16:12.513 --> 16:14.556
{\an1}(Steve laughs)
(camera whirring)

16:18.143 --> 16:19.895
Listen, Nat, we need to talk.

16:19.978 --> 16:21.063
Sure.

16:21.146 --> 16:24.733
{\an1}Listen, Nat,
hypothetically speaking,

16:24.817 --> 16:28.070
{\an1}(sighs) these two guys
are really good friends,

16:28.153 --> 16:29.571
{\an1}and they're
in business together.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.908
{\an1}And one guy, he has
to let the other guy go.

16:32.991 --> 16:35.911
{\an3}Friends shouldn't
be in business together.

16:35.994 --> 16:37.579
Yeah, but they are.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.957
Then the friend needs to know
it's nothing personal.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.083
Okay.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.334
How would you break it to him?

16:42.418 --> 16:46.296
Well, don't beat around the
bush; that only makes it worse.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.382
Gotta be direct.

16:48.465 --> 16:49.758
Direct.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.051
{\an1}Okay.

16:51.135 --> 16:54.054
Look, I noticed
your lease is up.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.890
My lease.

16:56.974 --> 16:57.975
Yeah.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.227
I saw that, too.

17:00.310 --> 17:01.770
I mean, typically
you've added what,

17:01.854 --> 17:02.938
rate of inflation to the rent?

17:03.021 --> 17:05.022
Yeah, something like that.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.442
If I need to add

17:06.525 --> 17:09.569
more, a couple of percent,
I could do that.

17:09.653 --> 17:11.571
A couple of percent.

17:11.655 --> 17:13.031
Well, that's good.

17:14.031 --> 17:16.201
But it's not good enough, is it?

17:19.163 --> 17:21.123
All right, Nat,
here it is, direct.

17:21.205 --> 17:23.500
I've got somebody willing
to double what you pay me.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.502
I can't match that.

17:26.587 --> 17:27.546
I know you can't.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.008
Something else I could do here,
I would do it.

17:31.091 --> 17:33.802
You mean, you took the offer?

17:33.886 --> 17:36.180
Yeah.

17:37.931 --> 17:39.224
Look, I'm sorry, man.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.814
(seagulls calling)

17:50.944 --> 17:53.655
{\an1}I told you,
I can't just stay.

17:53.739 --> 17:54.823
People do it
all the time.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.867
{\an3}It's not like you're
gonna get caught.

17:56.950 --> 17:59.661
I can't get work.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.955
{\an3}What do you mean?
You've already got work.

18:02.039 --> 18:05.542
{\an1}The cleaning service
Noah uses pays me in cash.

18:05.626 --> 18:08.545
A real job won't do that.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.964
{\an3}There's gotta be
something we can do.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.175
Yeah, find an employer

18:13.258 --> 18:16.345
{\an1}who will say I'm uniquely
qualified for a specific job.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.388
Wait a second, now if somebody
says that, then what happens?

18:18.472 --> 18:20.015
Like, your visa gets
renewed or something?

18:20.098 --> 18:22.017
Mm-hmm.

18:22.100 --> 18:22.851
{\an3}Well, how hard
can that be?

18:22.935 --> 18:24.812
David, my work experience

18:24.895 --> 18:26.814
consists of mopping up
spilled beer,

18:26.897 --> 18:29.900
and putting eyeliner on
one-legged mutants in a B-movie.

18:29.983 --> 18:31.819
That's unique.

18:31.902 --> 18:33.862
You're unique.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.865
And sweet and kind.

18:36.949 --> 18:40.160
{\an1}And I'm going to miss you
very much.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.585
This is ridiculous.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.003
I don't understand

18:50.087 --> 18:51.505
{\an3}why when you get back
to Venezuela,

18:51.588 --> 18:54.007
you can't just get another visa
and come back out here?

18:54.091 --> 18:57.386
I can, to visit.
But to stay? There's no way.

18:57.469 --> 18:58.804
So, that's it.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.848
I need a job.

19:00.931 --> 19:03.141
The kind I can't find.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.894
You know what?

19:05.978 --> 19:08.522
This might seem like a long
shot, but I've got this friend,

19:08.605 --> 19:10.440
{\an3}that, um...
What?

19:10.524 --> 19:12.860
{\an3}Take my keys,
all right?

19:12.943 --> 19:14.862
{\an3}Meet me back at
the house.

19:14.945 --> 19:16.697
It is for real?

19:16.780 --> 19:18.782
{\an3}I hope so.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.413
(knocking on door)

19:26.456 --> 19:27.583
Pia, hi.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.585
Come on in.
Thanks.

19:29.668 --> 19:30.752
{\an3}GINA: Oh, hi.
Hi.

19:30.836 --> 19:31.920
{\an3}I'm Gina.
Hi.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.922
{\an1}Um, should we
wait for Donna?

19:34.006 --> 19:35.757
No, no, that's okay.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.759
Um, she's okay
with whatever we do.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.887
{\an6}Oh.
Well, let's
all sit down.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.773
Well, what you
need is heat.

19:51.857 --> 19:55.611
And the easiest way to generate
that is with a gala opening.

19:55.694 --> 19:58.113
{\an3}Oh, we've already
had an opening.

19:58.196 --> 19:59.114
And who came?

19:59.197 --> 20:00.574
Um, mostly our friends.

20:00.657 --> 20:01.950
And was it covered
in the trades?

20:02.034 --> 20:03.493
Well... no.

20:03.577 --> 20:04.828
Then it never happened.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.872
Now if I organized
an opening?

20:06.955 --> 20:07.581
You'd have the three

20:07.664 --> 20:09.750
jewels of the publicity crown:

20:09.833 --> 20:12.419
celebrities, media and hype.

20:12.502 --> 20:14.671
{\an3}Why would celebrities
and the media come

20:14.755 --> 20:16.465
{\an3}to a phony opening
of a store

20:16.548 --> 20:17.799
{\an3}that's already been open
for six months?

20:17.883 --> 20:20.010
Simple, because we'd pay them
to be there.

20:20.093 --> 20:21.011
Pay them?

20:21.094 --> 20:22.054
And that's okay?

20:22.137 --> 20:23.764
Standard operating procedure.

20:23.847 --> 20:24.973
Oh, I don't know.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.058
Their being there

20:26.141 --> 20:28.310
{\an3}wouldn't have anything to do
with Donna's designs.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.479
{\an3}And I don't think she
would like that very much.

20:30.562 --> 20:31.813
Yeah, but you just
said she'd go along

20:31.897 --> 20:33.231
{\an1}with whatever
you guys agreed on, right?

20:33.315 --> 20:34.399
{\an3}Gina, can you
just give me...

20:34.483 --> 20:37.694
{\an1}Well, if you have doubt that,
we could just not tell her.

20:38.779 --> 20:39.863
Hmm.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.907
You mean keep
it a secret?

20:41.990 --> 20:43.867
Well, yeah.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.994
Kind of like
this meeting.

20:59.257 --> 21:02.469
So what exactly is it
that you, uh...

21:02.552 --> 21:04.513
think you're doing?

21:04.596 --> 21:06.181
About what?

21:06.264 --> 21:07.557
You know about what.

21:07.641 --> 21:08.850
About selling Nat out.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.852
Look, it was a business
decision.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.896
I talked to Nat, he understands.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.315
Let me tell you
what Nat understands.

21:15.399 --> 21:18.527
Nat understand that the life
that he's had for the last...

21:18.610 --> 21:20.529
23 years is over

21:20.612 --> 21:21.697
because of you.

21:21.780 --> 21:22.739
He's got a wife

21:22.823 --> 21:24.366
{\an1}and kid to support.
Look,

21:24.449 --> 21:25.867
I don't like it anymore
than you do, okay?

21:26.827 --> 21:27.703
I had no choice here.

21:27.786 --> 21:28.704
Oh, I see.

21:28.787 --> 21:31.540
{\an3}So, things get a little
tight, and you, uh,

21:31.623 --> 21:33.583
{\an3}what, you sell your friends
to the highest bidder?

21:33.667 --> 21:35.585
Like you wouldn't
do the same thing.

21:35.669 --> 21:36.878
I wouldn't.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.839
Why don't you spare me
the selfless act?

21:38.922 --> 21:40.757
You're like the most
selfish person I know.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.343
Yeah, but I wouldn't do this.

21:43.427 --> 21:44.886
No, you wouldn't have to.

21:44.970 --> 21:45.721
It's 'cause you're rich.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.389
It's got nothing to do
with money.

21:47.472 --> 21:50.392
{\an1}Really? Try losing all your
money like I lost mine,

21:50.475 --> 21:51.852
{\an1}then we'll sit here
and we'll talk about it.

21:51.935 --> 21:53.562
So, now that you're poor,

21:53.645 --> 21:54.938
it's okay to sell out a friend.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.732
{\an1}No. Okay?

21:56.815 --> 22:00.819
What's okay is making a tough
decision to get what I need.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.364
Even at the expense of somebody
I really care about.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.450
Don't do this.

22:09.286 --> 22:11.204
(sighs)

22:11.288 --> 22:13.290
It's done.

22:16.460 --> 22:17.586
Can I sit down?

22:17.669 --> 22:20.589
Yeah, sit down.

22:20.672 --> 22:23.967
Are you busy?

22:24.051 --> 22:26.845
I was in my office, right,
and this couple comes in,

22:26.928 --> 22:28.930
and they seemed like
a very happy couple.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.307
In fact, they-they tell me

22:30.390 --> 22:32.434
that they think they're
a perfect match, right?

22:32.517 --> 22:34.269
{\an3}But then,

22:34.352 --> 22:36.354
they asked me to draw up
a prenuptial agreement.

22:36.438 --> 22:38.565
I hate that.

22:38.648 --> 22:40.942
Protecting against the downside
is what they said.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.611
There is no such thing.

22:42.694 --> 22:44.154
See? Now that's
what I said exactly.

22:44.237 --> 22:46.782
But, uh, I don't know.

22:46.865 --> 22:49.618
Maybe... maybe
it's the smart way to go.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.578
What, signing some paper?

22:51.661 --> 22:54.122
{\an1}Waiting for everything
to be perfect?

22:54.206 --> 22:55.665
Like there's gonna
be some moment

22:55.749 --> 22:57.626
when it's gonna be okay
to make that leap

22:57.709 --> 22:58.919
because you won't get hurt.

22:59.002 --> 23:01.880
Maybe some people
just need a safety net.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.801
Yeah, maybe some people do.

23:19.606 --> 23:21.650
(clears throat)

23:22.609 --> 23:24.611
Ay. It's bad news, isn't it?

23:24.694 --> 23:25.862
Oh, Claudia, no.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.614
I knew it. I knew it.

23:27.697 --> 23:28.698
{\an1}(sighs)

23:28.782 --> 23:30.826
{\an1}It was too good
to be true anyway.

23:30.909 --> 23:34.371
{\an1}The important thing is...
you tried.

23:34.454 --> 23:36.623
Well, I did more than that.

23:36.706 --> 23:37.499
You did?

23:37.582 --> 23:39.042
Mm-hmm.

23:40.085 --> 23:41.962
{\an3}Well, okay,
there's this, uh...

23:42.045 --> 23:44.047
{\an3}this movie producer,
he's a big fan of my show.

23:44.131 --> 23:45.048
Wait, wait.

23:45.132 --> 23:47.008
{\an3}Movie producer?
Yeah.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.970
Anyway, he, uh... he said he
might have something for you.

23:50.053 --> 23:51.638
Uh, something specific.

23:51.721 --> 23:55.183
{\an1}Something he will say
I'm uniquely qualified for.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.184
I guess. I don't know.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.727
He said he wants to meet
with you this afternoon.

23:57.811 --> 23:59.020
This afternoon?

23:59.104 --> 24:01.148
Yeah. What, you have
a problem with that?

24:01.231 --> 24:04.484
{\an1}Yes, I have a problem
with that.

24:04.568 --> 24:05.652
I'm not prepared.

24:05.735 --> 24:07.362
It's only a job interview.

24:07.445 --> 24:10.699
That may or may not
let us be together.

24:10.782 --> 24:12.701
Well, uh...

24:12.784 --> 24:15.704
{\an3}he knows the whole
situation, okay? It's fine.

24:15.787 --> 24:16.872
{\an3}He does?
Yeah.

24:16.955 --> 24:18.248
You told him about us?

24:18.331 --> 24:20.208
{\an3}What I actually said
was, there's this

24:20.292 --> 24:22.878
incredible girl that I just
can't stop thinking about,

24:22.961 --> 24:25.881
or... kiss.

24:31.136 --> 24:33.680
{\an1}I can't believe
what you're doing for me.

24:33.763 --> 24:35.098
It's no big deal.

24:35.182 --> 24:36.600
{\an1}It is.

24:36.683 --> 24:40.562
It's more than anyone
has ever done for me.

24:48.278 --> 24:49.571
We already had an opening.

24:49.654 --> 24:51.239
Yes, and now we'll
have a reopening.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.450
This publicist says
people will show, right?

24:53.533 --> 24:54.743
{\an3}Yeah, yeah,
she's sure of it.

24:54.826 --> 24:56.244
{\an1}Kelly, it doesn't
make any sense.

24:56.328 --> 24:57.412
Why would anyone do that?

24:57.495 --> 24:58.705
Well, Pia knows people,

24:58.788 --> 25:01.541
and she's been telling everybody
what a great designer you are.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.877
(sighs)
They're never gonna show.

25:03.960 --> 25:05.420
Donna, yes, they will.

25:05.503 --> 25:07.756
{\an4}I just think it's a really
stupid idea.
Stupid?

25:07.839 --> 25:11.509
Uh, well, it was my idea, and I
wish you would respect that.

25:12.510 --> 25:14.846
(sighs)

25:18.516 --> 25:19.935
How come you don't?

25:20.018 --> 25:21.436
Don't what?

25:21.519 --> 25:22.812
I don't know. Respect her.

25:22.896 --> 25:25.273
{\an1}I do. I do respect her
and her ideas.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.441
This isn't about her.

25:26.524 --> 25:28.276
Well, it kind of
sounded like it.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.402
Look, the store is doing fine.

25:29.486 --> 25:31.112
{\an1}I mean, okay,
it's not doing great,

25:31.196 --> 25:32.280
but it's doing fine.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.615
I'm very comfortable with fine.

25:33.698 --> 25:34.574
Fine lasts.

25:34.658 --> 25:36.243
Okay, so, what about great?

25:36.326 --> 25:37.661
{\an1}Great, flash in the pan,
one-hit wonder.

25:37.744 --> 25:39.621
{\an1}What have you done
for me lately, you know?

25:39.704 --> 25:41.081
I'm sorry, you're
better than that.

25:41.164 --> 25:42.290
{\an1}Maybe.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.960
{\an1}But it's not worth risking
what I already have.

25:46.586 --> 25:48.296
{\an3}Can I ask you
a question?

25:48.380 --> 25:49.965
Yeah.

25:50.048 --> 25:53.176
{\an3}Look, say you and Kelly
are failing in here.

25:53.260 --> 25:57.180
{\an3}Okay? And you thought
maybe Kelly was to blame.

25:57.264 --> 25:58.932
What would you do?

25:59.015 --> 26:00.308
I'd talk to her.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.060
{\an3}All right, what if
you've already tried that,

26:02.143 --> 26:04.646
{\an3}and you've tried just about
everything you possibly could,

26:04.729 --> 26:07.941
and you had to choose between
the business or your friendship?

26:08.024 --> 26:09.776
Oh, that's an easy one.

26:09.859 --> 26:11.486
I'd save our friendship. Why?

26:11.569 --> 26:14.447
I was just curious.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.710
Sol's Pharmacy wants
50 more copies from now on.

26:26.793 --> 26:28.503
Pretty much like
every place else.

26:28.586 --> 26:29.754
Apology accepted.

26:29.838 --> 26:31.506
Did you notice

26:31.589 --> 26:33.508
that we got mentioned
in the <i> Tribune?</i>

26:33.591 --> 26:35.635
No. What did they say?

26:36.636 --> 26:38.305
It said that
we managed to

26:38.388 --> 26:40.348
{\an3}"further blur the line
between journalism,"

26:40.432 --> 26:42.350
and, I quote,
"hucksterism."

26:42.434 --> 26:44.352
That's great!

26:44.436 --> 26:45.812
That's great?

26:45.895 --> 26:47.022
They slammed us.

26:47.105 --> 26:48.523
{\an1}They mentioned us
in their paper.

26:48.606 --> 26:50.191
{\an1}They've got
a million subscribers.

26:50.275 --> 26:51.901
{\an1}You can't buy that kind
of publicity.

26:51.985 --> 26:53.403
Oh, well, then,
congratulations.

26:53.486 --> 26:55.196
You got pasted
free of charge.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.323
That's him, right over there.

26:56.406 --> 26:57.657
Are you the publisher?

26:57.741 --> 27:00.076
Yeah, I'm Steve Sanders.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.870
Are you a friend of Lou's?

27:01.953 --> 27:03.705
Uh, no, but I captured him.

27:03.788 --> 27:05.040
{\an5}Captured?
MAN:
Yeah.

27:05.123 --> 27:06.499
In the grocery store
where I work.

27:06.583 --> 27:07.417
He's a butcher.

27:07.500 --> 27:10.879
I'm asking his advice--
T-bone or tri-tip?

27:10.962 --> 27:13.423
{\an1}The next thing I know,
he's being congratulated over

27:13.506 --> 27:15.091
the loudspeaker
for nabbing the, uh,

27:15.175 --> 27:17.510
leprechaun of Beverly Hills.

27:17.594 --> 27:18.428
I'm here for my pot of gold.

27:18.511 --> 27:19.596
Yeah, well,

27:19.679 --> 27:21.264
I'm sorry, but there's...

27:21.348 --> 27:23.266
there is no such thing
as leprechauns.

27:23.350 --> 27:24.392
{\an3}Oh, really?

27:24.476 --> 27:26.227
JANET: Right now might be

27:26.311 --> 27:27.520
a good time to explain
that our fact-checking

27:27.604 --> 27:28.730
{\an3}isn't what it
used to be.

27:28.813 --> 27:31.066
It says right here
in the paper,

27:31.149 --> 27:32.942
you find the leprechaun,
you win a pot of gold.

27:33.026 --> 27:34.402
{\an6}STEVE:
Yeah, I know
what it says,

27:34.486 --> 27:36.404
but, uh, well, it's a lie.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.074
{\an3}It's a joke.
It's a promotional gag.

27:39.157 --> 27:40.283
You promised a pot of gold...

27:40.367 --> 27:42.619
and I'm not going
until I get it.

27:44.120 --> 27:45.121
And neither is anybody else.

28:01.471 --> 28:02.764
Hey, there's no gold.

28:02.847 --> 28:04.599
Not according
to this picture.

28:04.682 --> 28:06.935
{\an3}Look, that's,
um... that's...

28:07.018 --> 28:08.436
{\an3}That's just...
It's, it's candy

28:08.520 --> 28:09.938
{\an3}wrapped
in-in gold. See,

28:10.021 --> 28:11.773
it's... it's just chocolate.

28:11.856 --> 28:16.277
Look, Todd, you have every right
to be pissed at them.

28:16.361 --> 28:18.571
Oh, like you weren't part
of this deal, huh?

28:18.655 --> 28:19.906
It was your idea.
You're the one

28:19.989 --> 28:21.116
with the
tailor-fit leprechaun suit.

28:21.199 --> 28:24.077
Well, I got an elf suit, too,
and if idiots like you didn't

28:24.160 --> 28:26.079
{\an5}think that's all people like me
could do...
Oh, so,

28:26.162 --> 28:27.747
{\an3}I'm the one who's responsible
for your problems, huh?

28:27.831 --> 28:29.040
I said, stop it!

28:32.085 --> 28:35.964
Now, I... I know there's no
such thing as leprechauns.

28:36.047 --> 28:37.632
Okay? And I know there's

28:37.715 --> 28:39.467
no such things as pots of gold,

28:39.551 --> 28:40.844
but you promised a reward

28:40.927 --> 28:42.929
to somebody
who brought this man in.

28:43.012 --> 28:45.098
You have to make good on that.

28:46.433 --> 28:47.267
You have to.

28:47.350 --> 28:49.060
Why?

28:49.144 --> 28:50.812
Because I need the money.

28:50.895 --> 28:53.064
Well, why do you need the money?

28:55.859 --> 28:57.402
It's okay. You can tell us.

28:59.612 --> 29:02.657
(sighs)

29:02.740 --> 29:04.033
My son.

29:04.117 --> 29:06.161
He's got a heart condition.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.580
He needs an operation.

29:09.497 --> 29:11.749
Well, what about insurance?

29:11.833 --> 29:13.835
It's not covered.

29:13.918 --> 29:14.836
(Todd sighs)

29:14.919 --> 29:18.840
Preexisting condition
is what they called it.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.758
Bastards.

29:22.552 --> 29:25.722
There has to be
something you can do.

29:27.223 --> 29:30.477
Do you think that
I would be doing this right now

29:30.560 --> 29:33.563
if I had any other options?

29:34.898 --> 29:36.691
My son is going to die

29:36.774 --> 29:38.485
if I don't get that money.

29:40.904 --> 29:43.740
My little boy is gonna die.

29:50.955 --> 29:53.875
Buddy, David
Silver, KVIB.

29:53.958 --> 29:54.834
{\an3}Right!
Yeah.

29:54.918 --> 29:56.753
{\an5}David, nice
to see you.
This is Claudia.

29:56.836 --> 29:58.755
This is the makeup artist
I was telling you about.

29:58.838 --> 30:00.215
It's so nice to meet you.

30:00.298 --> 30:02.008
David has told me
so many wonderful things.

30:02.091 --> 30:03.259
Has he?

30:03.343 --> 30:04.552
CLAUDIA:
Yes.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.179
{\an3}Look, will you
excuse us a second?

30:06.262 --> 30:08.264
Sure.

30:11.017 --> 30:13.728
{\an3}Look, the makeup job
I told you about-- it's gone.

30:13.811 --> 30:14.854
Gone?

30:14.938 --> 30:17.482
Maybe you forgot how important
this job is to her.

30:17.565 --> 30:19.275
Without it, she has
to leave the country.

30:19.359 --> 30:21.194
The job she wants
went to the niece

30:21.277 --> 30:22.403
of the company's president.

30:22.487 --> 30:23.821
{\an3}There's nothing
I can do.

30:25.114 --> 30:26.241
{\an3}Sorry.

30:26.324 --> 30:27.700
Thanks.

30:32.121 --> 30:33.748
{\an3}(sighs)

30:33.831 --> 30:34.916
{\an1}You tried.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.584
Yeah.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.086
{\an1}I'll never forget
you for that.

30:38.169 --> 30:39.921
{\an3}Yeah, then, we'll figure
something out, okay?

30:40.004 --> 30:41.089
Sure we will.

30:41.172 --> 30:42.632
Sure.

30:44.801 --> 30:46.803
(upbeat music playing)

30:49.180 --> 30:52.225
(camera shutters clicking)

30:54.644 --> 30:55.770
Okay, I'll admit it.

30:55.853 --> 30:57.272
{\an3}I was wrong.
This is great.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.440
{\an1}Yup. Have you ever seen
so many actors

30:59.524 --> 31:00.817
{\an1}with movies about
to be released?

31:00.900 --> 31:03.111
No. I feel like I'm
in a movie premiere.

31:03.194 --> 31:05.613
{\an3}Thank you. I know how
hard you worked on this.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.824
{\an1}You have to know
I would never put the business

31:07.907 --> 31:09.075
before our friendship.

31:09.158 --> 31:10.285
I know.

31:10.368 --> 31:12.745
Is this fantastic, or what?

31:12.829 --> 31:14.622
Yes. How you did it,
I will never know.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.791
It was simple.
They love your designs.

31:30.054 --> 31:32.724
Mm. What was that for?

31:32.807 --> 31:35.602
Your editorial.

31:35.685 --> 31:37.770
I was actually...

31:37.854 --> 31:41.149
moved.

31:41.232 --> 31:42.942
{\an3}Thanks.

31:43.026 --> 31:45.862
The way you described what Todd
was going through with his son.

31:45.945 --> 31:47.113
Well, if that were me,

31:47.196 --> 31:48.656
and someone offered me a pot
of gold,

31:48.740 --> 31:50.491
I'd hold him hostage
to get it, too.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.703
As for what you wrote
about Lou...

31:53.786 --> 31:54.954
Too much?

31:55.038 --> 31:59.375
"The little person we hired
to play a leprechaun accused me

31:59.459 --> 32:01.502
{\an1}"of thinking
that's all he was good for.

32:01.586 --> 32:02.670
"And he was right.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.340
"I thought "of Lou as little,

32:05.423 --> 32:07.675
and I should have thought of him
as a person."

32:07.759 --> 32:10.011
That's hard to hear.

32:10.094 --> 32:11.679
Yeah.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.097
It's harder to admit...

32:14.766 --> 32:17.060
...but I'm really,
really proud of you.

32:28.029 --> 32:30.698
(upbeat music playing,
camera shutters clicking)

32:30.782 --> 32:33.826
So, this is great, isn't it?

32:33.910 --> 32:36.037
{\an3}Uh, yeah, well, yeah,
you could say that.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.413
Well, thanks to Kelly.

32:37.497 --> 32:38.539
{\an1}If it wasn't
for her persistence,

32:38.623 --> 32:39.707
it never would have happened.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.709
Right, her persistence

32:41.793 --> 32:43.711
and your money.

32:43.795 --> 32:48.049
Well, yeah, I know, Pia cost
a lot, but she's well worth it.

32:48.132 --> 32:51.010
Are you really okay with paying
celebrities to be here?

32:51.094 --> 32:54.013
No, they're... no--

32:54.097 --> 32:56.432
God, Gina, they're here
'cause they like my stuff.

32:56.516 --> 32:58.559
Oh, no, of course
they love your stuff.

32:58.643 --> 32:59.852
{\an3}It's...

32:59.936 --> 33:01.270
just that

33:01.354 --> 33:02.855
that's not why they're here.

33:07.318 --> 33:09.070
{\an3}I know what you're gonna
say, and I told you,

33:09.153 --> 33:10.613
{\an3}I don't like the idea
of a prenuptial

33:10.697 --> 33:12.031
any more than you do.

33:12.115 --> 33:14.242
{\an1}But you understand
why they're doing it.

33:14.325 --> 33:15.576
What's your point?

33:15.660 --> 33:17.912
That you're doing the same
exact thing they're doing.

33:17.995 --> 33:19.247
{\an1}You're waiting for
everything to be perfect.

33:19.330 --> 33:20.415
Wait a minute, as I recall,

33:20.498 --> 33:21.541
{\an3}you promised
you'd wait for me.

33:21.624 --> 33:22.917
Yes, I did.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.253
{\an1}Now I would like you
to promise me something.

33:25.336 --> 33:26.587
Yeah, what? Sure.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.423
That you won't be
like that couple.

33:28.506 --> 33:32.093
{\an1}You won't protect
against the downside.

33:32.176 --> 33:33.970
{\an1}Did you pay people
to show up here tonight?

33:34.053 --> 33:34.929
Donna...

33:35.012 --> 33:36.097
Yes or no?

33:36.180 --> 33:37.557
Some.

33:38.307 --> 33:39.392
All.

33:39.475 --> 33:41.602
God, I knew
this was such a bad idea.

33:41.686 --> 33:44.605
But it's not, it's a big hit.
It's a fraud, all of it!

33:44.689 --> 33:46.774
Donna, maybe you want to have
this talk a little later?

33:46.858 --> 33:49.777
You know, people aren't here
because of what we do,

33:49.861 --> 33:51.320
not because we paid them.

33:51.404 --> 33:52.405
So what?

33:52.488 --> 33:53.781
It's what we want.
What difference does it make?

33:53.865 --> 33:55.491
No, what we want is respect.

33:55.575 --> 33:56.617
You don't get that
by paying people.

33:56.701 --> 33:57.869
Donna, don't ruin this.

33:57.952 --> 33:59.704
You know what, you said that you
would never put this business

33:59.787 --> 34:02.290
before our friendship, and that
is exactly what you did.

34:02.373 --> 34:04.000
And you get out of here now

34:04.083 --> 34:05.918
and take everyone else
here with you.

34:14.051 --> 34:16.219
♪ ♪

34:22.601 --> 34:24.270
You look awful.

34:24.353 --> 34:26.272
Thanks.

34:26.355 --> 34:29.442
{\an3}Anytime.
You seen Noah?

34:29.525 --> 34:31.444
No. He'll be here.

34:31.527 --> 34:32.987
Mm.

34:33.070 --> 34:35.989
Claudia's visa expired.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.034
She's gotta leave the country.

34:38.117 --> 34:39.494
You want her to stay?

34:39.577 --> 34:41.536
Yeah, I do.

34:41.621 --> 34:42.830
So make it happen.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.081
I tried.

34:44.165 --> 34:45.708
{\an3}Yeah, well, try
harder, Dave.

34:45.792 --> 34:47.502
You gotta try. I mean,
you gotta try anything,

34:47.585 --> 34:49.337
or you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.547
{\an3}Trust me.

34:55.426 --> 34:56.719
Hey, Noah.

34:56.803 --> 34:58.513
{\an3}Look, I'm not in the
mood, all right?

34:58.596 --> 35:01.474
{\an1}Oh, that's okay, listen,
I, uh-- the deal that you cut

35:01.557 --> 35:02.517
regarding the Peach Pit,

35:02.600 --> 35:03.601
it's been uncut.

35:03.684 --> 35:05.144
{\an1}Really?
Yeah.

35:05.228 --> 35:06.229
I went to the bank today.

35:06.312 --> 35:07.313
You know, the bank?

35:07.396 --> 35:08.564
The one where you took out

35:08.648 --> 35:09.816
the mortgage for the building?

35:09.899 --> 35:10.858
What'd you tell them?

35:10.942 --> 35:12.360
Oh, I didn't tell them anything.

35:12.443 --> 35:13.486
But I did buy the mortgage.

35:13.569 --> 35:17.532
{\an1}See now, that means, uh,
you make your payments to me,

35:17.615 --> 35:20.368
and since you can't
make those payments,

35:20.451 --> 35:21.494
I'm foreclosing on you.

35:34.423 --> 35:35.508
But why would Todd sue us?

35:35.591 --> 35:36.926
False advertising.

35:37.009 --> 35:38.094
Pain and suffering.

35:38.177 --> 35:40.054
Who knows?
The guy's desperate.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.892
Check it out.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.769
{\an3}After the way we
misled our readers?

35:46.853 --> 35:48.521
I'm afraid to.

35:52.024 --> 35:54.068
{\an5}What's this
all about?
Well...

35:56.279 --> 35:58.406
{\an1}"Dear Beverly Beat,
I read about that

35:58.489 --> 36:00.283
{\an1}"poor man and his son.
I hope this helps.

36:00.366 --> 36:01.367
"Sincerely, Eric."

36:01.450 --> 36:02.410
He sent twenty dollars.

36:05.329 --> 36:07.039
"To whom it may concern:

36:07.123 --> 36:08.916
Your editorial about
that father and his boy,

36:09.000 --> 36:10.418
well, I just wish
I could do more.

36:10.501 --> 36:11.752
{\an3}Anne."

36:11.836 --> 36:13.462
She sent a hundred.

36:14.672 --> 36:18.092
Oh... another $75.

36:18.175 --> 36:20.219
Fifty.

36:20.303 --> 36:22.430
How many letters do
you think are here?

36:22.513 --> 36:24.056
There must be a couple
hundred letters here,

36:24.140 --> 36:25.099
but they're all pledges.

36:25.182 --> 36:27.602
It's a miracle.

36:27.685 --> 36:29.312
No, it's not.

36:29.395 --> 36:31.355
It's a pot of gold.

36:31.439 --> 36:32.440
(laughing)

36:41.240 --> 36:42.783
{\an3}(clears throat)
Good morning.

36:42.867 --> 36:44.160
{\an1}Hello.

36:44.243 --> 36:45.286
{\an3}Listen, Donna,
about last night...

36:45.369 --> 36:47.788
{\an1}I really don't want
to talk about it.

36:47.872 --> 36:50.249
{\an3}All right.

36:50.333 --> 36:51.459
{\an3}You're both here.
Good.

36:51.542 --> 36:54.420
Look, if you're here to talk
about that ridiculous opening...

36:54.503 --> 36:56.297
That ridiculously
successful opening.

36:56.380 --> 36:57.173
Last night was a disaster.

36:57.256 --> 36:58.424
{\an1}What are you
talking about?

36:58.507 --> 37:00.009
It was a huge hit.

37:00.092 --> 37:01.636
You're as good as on the
top ten list already.

37:01.719 --> 37:03.638
Like no one saw us fighting.

37:03.721 --> 37:06.098
Last night was a smash
because you fought.

37:06.182 --> 37:08.601
{\an1}PIA:
Everyone is talking about it.

37:08.684 --> 37:10.102
She paid people to come
and they liked it

37:10.186 --> 37:11.687
because we were yelling
at each other.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.105
{\an1}PIA:
Who cares why they liked it?

37:13.189 --> 37:14.315
The point is, they did.

37:14.398 --> 37:15.524
But not for the right reasons.

37:15.608 --> 37:18.277
I forgot,
you're the idealistic one.

37:19.445 --> 37:20.321
{\an1}You hired me
to get you publicity.

37:20.404 --> 37:21.989
And that's what you got.

37:22.073 --> 37:24.492
Yeah, and now I think
our work is done with you.

37:25.576 --> 37:27.787
You're making a mistake.

37:27.870 --> 37:29.080
We don't think so.

37:39.382 --> 37:42.009
We've never fought
like that before.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.803
Not like that.

37:43.886 --> 37:45.304
I hated it.

37:45.388 --> 37:46.347
Me, too.

37:46.430 --> 37:48.182
Look, if you're
not happy here...

37:48.265 --> 37:49.642
I am.

37:49.725 --> 37:51.060
And if you're not,
you'll tell me?

37:51.143 --> 37:53.145
I promise.

37:54.271 --> 37:56.190
I'm sorry.

37:56.273 --> 37:58.609
Me, too.

38:02.780 --> 38:05.199
{\an1}What do you mean
you're not going to do it?

38:05.282 --> 38:06.909
Just that.

38:06.993 --> 38:08.160
I'm sorry for your trouble

38:08.244 --> 38:09.412
and of course
there'll be no charge.

38:09.495 --> 38:10.371
{\an3}That's it?

38:10.454 --> 38:13.374
Yes, yes it is.

38:17.962 --> 38:20.089
No, no, no, it's not.

38:20.172 --> 38:23.134
See, I pretty much

38:23.217 --> 38:24.385
take any case that I can get.

38:24.468 --> 38:27.763
So writing up a prenup seemed
like no big deal, but it is.

38:27.847 --> 38:29.223
In some ways,
it's one of the biggest.

38:29.306 --> 38:31.517
See, if I help you

38:31.600 --> 38:34.020
protect yourself
from each other, pad the fall,

38:34.103 --> 38:35.229
make breaking up
the least bit bearable,

38:35.312 --> 38:37.023
then you know what, I've done
you a terrible disservice.

38:37.106 --> 38:39.775
I mean, you love
each other, huh?

38:39.859 --> 38:41.193
Then bet the farm.

38:41.277 --> 38:42.403
No hedge.

38:42.486 --> 38:44.238
No, no protecting
against the downside.

38:44.321 --> 38:45.406
No guarantee against failure.

38:45.489 --> 38:47.074
Because take it from me,
if you do anything

38:47.158 --> 38:49.160
other than that, you might
as well do nothing at all.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.252
Listen, you gotta
hear me out, man.

38:58.335 --> 39:00.254
No, I don't.

39:00.337 --> 39:02.590
It's not going to
change anything.

39:02.673 --> 39:04.633
{\an1}Look, I'm
in trouble, okay?

39:04.717 --> 39:05.634
Yeah, I know.

39:05.718 --> 39:08.888
Something about a couple
of bands blowing you off

39:08.971 --> 39:11.932
and the, uh, club scene not
really being hot right now.

39:12.016 --> 39:14.101
{\an3}The banker told me
all about that.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.770
{\an1}Look, that stuff
is nothing.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.730
{\an3}(sighs)
What, you've got

39:17.813 --> 39:20.608
some one-time heartache
you want to tell me about?

39:20.691 --> 39:23.444
Yeah, my father killing himself
after he lost all his money.

39:23.527 --> 39:25.112
The connection being...?

39:25.196 --> 39:26.947
The guy left my mom
with nothing, okay?

39:27.031 --> 39:29.116
I support her now.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.326
At least I did
until you horned in.

39:31.702 --> 39:33.120
Hey, you close me down

39:33.204 --> 39:34.789
and then you come
here for a meal?

39:34.872 --> 39:35.956
{\an3}No chance.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.626
It's all right, Nat, relax,
nobody's closing you down.

39:38.709 --> 39:39.835
What about the lease?

39:39.919 --> 39:41.462
I think you got it extended.

39:41.545 --> 39:42.880
Uh, same rate.

39:44.507 --> 39:46.092
Dylan, I don't mind
paying an increase.

39:46.175 --> 39:47.927
Just as long as it's fair.

39:48.010 --> 39:49.345
And what about
your better offer?

39:50.387 --> 39:51.639
I turned it down.

39:51.722 --> 39:52.473
You.

39:52.556 --> 39:53.933
Yeah, see, I, uh,

39:54.016 --> 39:55.476
bought the building.

39:55.559 --> 39:57.019
I figure you could
run the diner,

39:57.103 --> 39:59.021
and, well, you could
run the club

39:59.105 --> 40:01.524
and I'll make
the tough decisions.

40:01.607 --> 40:04.819
Are we clear?
(pats Nat's arm)

40:06.612 --> 40:08.989
Completely.

40:17.039 --> 40:19.041
{\an1}I'll never be able
to thank you enough.

40:19.125 --> 40:21.043
Oh, the ones to thank
are our readers.

40:21.127 --> 40:23.212
{\an6}None of this would've been
possible without them.
Yeah.

40:23.295 --> 40:25.798
And the matching grand
pledged by your paper.

40:25.881 --> 40:27.133
Well, together, there
should be enough money

40:27.216 --> 40:28.008
for your boy's operation.

40:28.092 --> 40:30.136
Something I never
dreamed possible.

40:35.641 --> 40:37.059

about when you helped me
clean up the other night.

40:41.230 --> 40:44.066
{\an1}How sweet.
Eh...

40:44.150 --> 40:45.985
(giggling)

40:46.068 --> 40:49.029
Uh, you know this friend of
mine, he's a pretty smart guy.

40:49.113 --> 40:51.157
He, uh, he told me
I should do anything

40:51.240 --> 40:52.992
to keep you from leaving.

40:53.075 --> 40:54.076
Anything?

40:54.160 --> 40:55.369
That's what he said.

40:55.452 --> 40:56.662
What do you say?

40:56.745 --> 40:58.414
I say he's right.

40:58.497 --> 40:59.748
Tsk.

41:01.083 --> 41:02.209
Then marry me.

41:02.293 --> 41:04.336
What?

41:04.420 --> 41:06.755
That way, I can get my green
card and I don't have to leave.

41:07.965 --> 41:11.093
Oh, I'm sorry
,I shouldn't have...

41:11.177 --> 41:12.511
{\an1}Never mind.
Yes.

41:12.595 --> 41:13.888

41:37.453 --> 41:38.746
That was so good.

41:38.829 --> 41:40.039
Mm.

41:40.998 --> 41:43.918
What you did today.

41:44.001 --> 41:46.086
{\an3}I was just taking
your advice.

41:46.170 --> 41:49.924
{\an3}Doing something constructive
with my money.

41:50.007 --> 41:55.054
No, you helped your friend.

41:55.137 --> 41:59.391
{\an3}Let's say I found
a direction.

41:59.475 --> 42:02.770
You're buying a nightclub.

42:02.853 --> 42:04.980
Hey, I bought a business.

42:05.064 --> 42:07.441
{\an3}Now, where it's going to
lead, I have no idea,

42:07.524 --> 42:12.112
{\an3}but the idea of owning
something kind of...

42:12.196 --> 42:15.574
{\an3}I don't know,
appealed to me.

42:15.658 --> 42:21.247
{\an1}Oh, (laughing) yeah,
I think that maybe the idea

42:21.330 --> 42:25.125
{\an1}of being boss is
what's appealing to you.

42:25.209 --> 42:28.128
{\an3}Well, that's kind of an
added extra bonus, you know.

42:28.212 --> 42:33.759
It's like you being a good
influence and really sexy.

42:33.842 --> 42:37.221
Wow, imagine that.

Happily, I don't have to.

42:48.065 --> 42:50.025
(knocking on door)

42:56.865 --> 42:58.158
I'm still scared.

42:58.242 --> 43:00.160
I know.

43:00.244 --> 43:04.290
{\an3}And, uh, in a lot of ways,
I'm still a mess.

43:04.373 --> 43:07.334
I know that, too.

43:07.418 --> 43:08.961
But I love you.

Yeah.

So...

What are you waiting for?

43:25.519 --> 43:26.812
That's just it.

43:26.895 --> 43:28.105
I'm not.

43:29.565 --> 43:30.524
Not anymore.
