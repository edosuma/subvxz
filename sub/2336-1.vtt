<i>There's one word to describe
what's happening and that word is "panic."</i>

00:36.469 --> 00:39.814
<i>And of course this comes with
unthinkable irrational behavior.</i>

00:40.006 --> 00:42.748
<i>The crash
of '29, 1987's Black Monday,</i>

00:42.876 --> 00:45.618
<i>came with tragic
suicides and murders.</i>

00:45.979 --> 00:48.118
<i>This collapse is no exception.</i>

00:48.748 --> 00:51.490
<i>Just one hour ago,
as the markets were opening,</i>

00:51.551 --> 00:53.724
<i>two partners at
Capt Villiers Holdings</i>

00:53.787 --> 00:56.267

company's headquarters.</i>

00:56.322 --> 00:59.428
<i>Senior partner Laura
Mailer died on site</i>

00:59.492 --> 01:02.905

01:02.962 --> 01:05.738
<i>Jeffrey Desange,
also senior partner,</i>

shooting and has now gone missing.</i>

01:30.156 --> 01:33.330
Victoria... We...
We gotta go, sweetheart.

01:35.662 --> 01:36.834
That's it.

01:37.730 --> 01:39.835
Isn't Mommy
taking me to school?

01:40.800 --> 01:42.677
Mommy's not feeling well.

01:44.737 --> 01:49.345
Put on your glasses.
Come on. Let's go.

02:05.658 --> 02:07.638
Daddy, where are we going?

02:10.029 --> 02:11.167
I don't know.

02:35.021 --> 02:36.056
Fuck!

02:38.525 --> 02:40.436
You're driving too fast!

02:53.673 --> 02:55.880
Daddy, you're driving too...

02:55.942 --> 02:56.977
Shut up!

03:23.169 --> 03:24.204
Sorry, excuse me.

03:25.805 --> 03:27.478
Whoa! Hey, buddy, you wanna
get behind the tape?

03:27.540 --> 03:29.349
I'm family.
Lucas Desange.

03:29.409 --> 03:31.912
You called me, someone called
me, a detective or something.

03:31.978 --> 03:32.979
You live here?

03:33.079 --> 03:36.549
No, no, my brother lives here.
What's going on? Where's Jeff?

03:38.451 --> 03:39.759
Are the girls okay?
Where are the girls?

03:39.819 --> 03:42.390
Sir, just hang on, all right?
Just wait here.

03:42.455 --> 03:43.729
Oh, Jesus Christ!

03:51.397 --> 03:54.810
<i>...Jeffrey Desange apparently
shot two business partners to death</i>

03:54.867 --> 03:57.541
<i>before going onto
murder his estranged wife</i>

03:57.604 --> 04:00.778
<i>and kidnap his two daughters
aged three and one.</i>

04:08.314 --> 04:10.487
It's okay.
It's okay, come on.

04:11.384 --> 04:13.489
Daddy, are we there yet?

04:17.724 --> 04:19.226
My glasses are broken.

04:32.538 --> 04:33.608
What is it?

04:35.375 --> 04:37.412
This is okay. Yeah.

05:07.907 --> 05:08.942
Victoria, come here.

05:09.008 --> 05:10.248
There's someone inside.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.045
Now!

05:48.715 --> 05:50.991
Come on, come on.

06:32.892 --> 06:36.135
Daddy!
There's a woman outside.

06:39.766 --> 06:41.768
She's not touching the floor.

07:09.028 --> 07:10.268
Why are you crying?

07:11.764 --> 07:12.765
'Cause I'm sad, honey.

07:14.066 --> 07:15.374
Why are you sad?

07:16.803 --> 07:23.743
You know, moms and dads,
they try real hard,

07:25.077 --> 07:27.284
but sometimes
they mess things up.

07:29.916 --> 07:31.190
You know Daddy
loves you, right?

07:32.819 --> 07:33.820
Uh-huh.

07:36.422 --> 07:37.730
I can't see.

07:41.861 --> 07:42.862
What's that?

07:57.977 --> 07:58.978
Look, honey, a deer.

08:24.804 --> 08:25.805
Daddy?

08:29.308 --> 08:30.309
Daddy?

08:38.317 --> 08:42.561
Daddy? Daddy?

09:17.890 --> 09:20.063
Look, Lilly, a cherry.

12:03.923 --> 12:04.924
Burnsie!

12:05.424 --> 12:06.596
So where are you guys today?

12:06.826 --> 12:12.276
Well, we're gonna have another
look around Sector 1-7-12-33.

12:12.898 --> 12:14.707
That's the mountain road, right?
Uh-huh.

12:15.434 --> 12:20.247
Gas station... Go up through the
Wilson Pass... It sounds good.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.043
Oh, God, I hate to do this.

12:22.508 --> 12:23.782
<i>Do what?</i>

12:24.310 --> 12:26.256
Your last payment didn't clear.

12:27.113 --> 12:31.994
Well... I'll check on that. Don't
worry about it. The bank's screwing up.

12:33.853 --> 12:35.773
All right, I'll look into
it and get back to you.

12:37.156 --> 12:38.635
Thanks. Bye.

12:39.792 --> 12:43.137
Thank you, God. Sweet!

12:44.096 --> 12:45.439
That Burnsie on the phone?

12:45.498 --> 12:46.738
Yup.

12:46.799 --> 12:53.011
What's his next move? Is he going to
search sector plural-Z-alpha?

12:54.974 --> 12:56.578
Hey, guess who's not pregnant?

12:58.444 --> 13:00.117
What is wrong with you?

13:03.449 --> 13:05.053
The last payment didn't clear.

13:09.755 --> 13:11.860
So there's a problem
with the bank or...

13:11.991 --> 13:13.061
The money's gone.

13:13.826 --> 13:14.827
I pick "B".

13:15.628 --> 13:17.164
That is the correct answer.

13:19.999 --> 13:22.946
Hey, look, babe.
It's your brother.

13:23.002 --> 13:26.540
You wanna spend all your money trying
to find him, it's okay with me.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.676
It's cheaper than therapy.

13:29.108 --> 13:30.246
And so am I.

13:30.309 --> 13:31.310
Whoa!

13:44.390 --> 13:46.392
I need to go.
Mmm-hmm.

13:59.572 --> 14:00.573
Burnsie!

14:01.674 --> 14:02.675
What?

14:03.375 --> 14:04.752
Hey, Burnsie!

14:05.344 --> 14:06.618
Jesus Christ!

14:12.651 --> 14:14.062
We gonna call him?

14:14.119 --> 14:15.723
Just give me a minute.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.327
Well, we should call!
We said we'd call.

14:18.390 --> 14:23.567
Ronnie, shut up
just for one minute.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.740
Here you go,
Bird, take a whiff of that.

15:10.809 --> 15:11.947
Hello!

15:31.263 --> 15:32.298
Uh-huh.

15:32.364 --> 15:34.810
Yes, sir. Yes, sir,
yes, sir, yes, sir.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.966
It's cherry pits.

16:29.254 --> 16:30.460
Hey, Burnsie!

16:59.284 --> 17:02.322
Burnsie, can we call him now?

17:27.646 --> 17:28.852
They found them.

17:29.381 --> 17:30.451
You're shitting me.

17:30.783 --> 17:33.320
They found the girls, alive.

17:40.993 --> 17:43.496
Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss,
and you must be Annabel.

17:43.562 --> 17:44.768
I must be.

17:45.497 --> 17:46.635
Lucas.
How are they?

17:47.933 --> 17:50.914
Well, just let me warn you,
this won't be easy.

17:53.605 --> 17:55.846
We're very fortunate
that Victoria was

17:55.974 --> 17:58.250
old enough to retain
much of her vocabulary.

17:58.310 --> 18:00.916
But it's still too early to determine
if her social development...

18:00.979 --> 18:02.390
What about the other one?

18:03.649 --> 18:04.821
That's a different story.

18:18.197 --> 18:19.335
Jesus.

18:25.137 --> 18:26.172
Oh, yeah.

18:30.809 --> 18:32.550
Hey, Victoria.

18:44.623 --> 18:47.331
Is that you, Lilly? Hey!

18:50.863 --> 18:52.900
No, no, no.
It's okay, it's okay.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.003
I'm not gonna hurt you.

18:58.370 --> 18:59.542
Hey...

19:01.306 --> 19:02.614
It's okay, it's okay.

19:07.045 --> 19:10.288
<i>I got something for you,
for your eyes.</i>

19:11.617 --> 19:16.760
When you were a little girl, you had
a pair of these. Do you remember?

19:18.957 --> 19:23.406
I'm just gonna put... That's okay.
I'm just gonna put them here.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.043
It's okay.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.385
Yeah.

19:45.617 --> 19:46.960
That's it.

20:08.140 --> 20:09.346
Daddy?

20:12.110 --> 20:17.685
No, no, honey. Honey, no. I'm...
I'm not your daddy, I'm...

20:19.084 --> 20:22.861
I'm your daddy's brother.
Remember? Uncle Luke?

20:30.762 --> 20:31.934
Dad?

20:34.333 --> 20:35.505
Oh...

20:39.671 --> 20:41.344
It's okay.

20:41.406 --> 20:42.510
Dad?

20:42.574 --> 20:44.076
It's okay.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.730
Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss,
Your Honor.

20:57.789 --> 20:59.860
The girls have been in
my care at the Institute

20:59.992 --> 21:02.029
since they were
found 87 days ago.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.199
And how would you
define their progress?

21:04.763 --> 21:09.678
Solid, and astoundingly fast.
If I may?

21:13.905 --> 21:16.146
Your Honor,
Victoria and Lilly Desange

21:16.275 --> 21:18.551
were found in
deplorable conditions,

21:19.244 --> 21:24.557
isolated, starved. They feared and
distrusted all physical contact.

21:25.083 --> 21:29.828
Their emotional growth was clearly
compromised by their abandonment.

21:29.888 --> 21:32.232
In order to survive
such extreme isolation,

21:32.357 --> 21:34.735
the girls created
an imaginary guardian,

21:35.661 --> 21:39.336
a parent figure to feed them,
sing to them, protect them.

21:40.766 --> 21:42.746
They called her "Mama."

21:45.103 --> 21:48.414
Victoria and Lilly have a real
chance at a normal life now.

21:49.041 --> 21:51.715
With the right care, physical
and emotional development,

21:51.777 --> 21:55.657
and much-needed love and
affection, they will get better.

21:55.714 --> 21:57.557
Thank you, Dr. Dreyfuss.

21:57.616 --> 22:00.893
Miss Podolski, would you
care to address the court?

22:00.952 --> 22:01.952
Good morning, Your Honor.

22:02.187 --> 22:04.428
Jeffrey Desange
murdered my niece

22:04.556 --> 22:06.797
and abandoned his
daughters in the forest.

22:06.858 --> 22:09.099
Now, his brother did
an extraordinary thing.

22:09.227 --> 22:11.537
Lucas never gave
up on his nieces,

22:11.797 --> 22:14.277
but he did it for the girls,
not for himself.

22:14.399 --> 22:16.879
So if he still has their
best interest at heart,

22:17.336 --> 22:20.180
he must know that neither his
salary nor his very small apartment

22:20.238 --> 22:22.377
are suitable for
the raising of two children,

22:22.441 --> 22:24.682
let alone two children
with very special needs.

22:24.743 --> 22:26.143
How many kids have
you raised, Jean?

22:26.144 --> 22:27.589
About as many as you, Lucas.

22:29.581 --> 22:31.021
Of course she wants
the girls, Lucas.

22:31.116 --> 22:32.527
Stand in her shoes
for a second.

22:32.617 --> 22:36.064
She can't just sweep in and take them.
They're not hers to take.

22:36.722 --> 22:38.065
I'm not sure
that's entirely fair.

22:38.123 --> 22:41.730
I'll tell you what's not fair. It's not
fair that she gets to buy my nieces.

22:42.160 --> 22:43.764
Would it really be
such a bad thing?

22:43.829 --> 22:45.035
What?

22:46.465 --> 22:50.470
Annabel plays in a band. You
draw pictures for a living.

22:50.535 --> 22:54.244
The way you live, do you have
room for children in your life?

22:54.306 --> 22:55.376
I mean, really?

22:56.441 --> 22:57.681
What are you saying, Gerald?

22:59.711 --> 23:01.850
When it comes to
the girls' welfare,

23:01.913 --> 23:05.360
the family court judge is pretty much
obliged to act on my recommendation.

23:05.417 --> 23:08.159
And right now, I'd be
lying if I didn't say

23:08.220 --> 23:10.530
it was a slam dunk
for Miss Podolski.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.301
But the truth is,

23:14.393 --> 23:16.134
I don't want them living on
the other side of the country

23:16.194 --> 23:17.730
any more than you do.

23:18.430 --> 23:22.845
So, we can really, really help
each other out right now.

23:24.369 --> 23:27.907
You want the girls, I need
continued access to them.

23:28.940 --> 23:30.783
What do we gotta do?

23:36.348 --> 23:40.228
This house, courtesy of the
Institute, is used for case studies.

23:40.285 --> 23:44.461
Rent free. You move to the
house, you get the girls.

23:45.390 --> 23:47.461
This is a joke, right?

23:53.465 --> 23:55.103
Mr. Desange,
is your brother still alive?

23:55.167 --> 23:56.968
Has your brother contacted you?

23:58.970 --> 24:00.677
Oh, son of a bitch.

24:01.973 --> 24:03.077
Look, Jean...

24:03.141 --> 24:07.021
No. I just want to
see them, that's all.

24:07.078 --> 24:09.490
You'll see them, I mean,
you've got visitation rights,

24:09.548 --> 24:13.621
we respect that, but right
now, we need a little space.

24:13.685 --> 24:16.564
Just work on this thing for a while.
Find our feet.

24:19.357 --> 24:20.529
Okay?

24:20.592 --> 24:21.798
Excuse me.

24:22.360 --> 24:24.033
<i>October 26th.</i>

24:24.095 --> 24:26.097
Although she
seems collaborative

24:26.231 --> 24:28.268
and is quickly recovering
her language skills,

24:29.501 --> 24:31.879
<i>Victoria may be
repressing the memory</i>

24:32.003 --> 24:34.381
<i>of her experience
in the wilderness.</i>

24:35.440 --> 24:38.785
Okay, Victoria,
are you nice and relaxed?

24:40.278 --> 24:42.451
Are you feeling sleepy?

24:43.548 --> 24:48.588
I want you to tell me the story again.
Can you tell me the story?

24:52.924 --> 24:54.733
It was a long time ago.

24:54.793 --> 24:57.296
A lady ran away from a
hospital for sad people.

24:59.598 --> 25:03.375
She took her baby.
They jumped into the water.

25:05.103 --> 25:07.379
How could you know
that story, Victoria?

25:08.740 --> 25:10.879
Did Mama tell you that story?

25:11.176 --> 25:12.382
She showed me.

25:12.444 --> 25:13.684
How?

25:14.980 --> 25:16.186
In a dream.

25:17.115 --> 25:18.788
Go on, Victoria.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.836
And you can't tell
anyone where you are?

25:30.495 --> 25:31.701
Nope.

25:32.063 --> 25:33.565
That's just bizarre, dude.

25:33.965 --> 25:37.071
Yeah, well, it's for the
girls, to keep the press away.

25:38.670 --> 25:40.047
It's so messed up, though.

25:40.305 --> 25:42.114
All families are messed up.

25:42.507 --> 25:44.680
Yeah, but this one's
messed up and instant.

25:45.844 --> 25:47.585
Heck, I didn't even
have the chance

25:47.712 --> 25:49.487
to screw 'em up,
they came that way.

25:50.415 --> 25:51.553
Leave him.

25:51.616 --> 25:52.788
Can't.

25:53.118 --> 25:55.029
You didn't sign
up for this, babe.

25:57.455 --> 25:58.729
I can't do that to him.

25:59.190 --> 26:02.603
Mrs. Sensitivity.
You are in a rock band.

26:05.096 --> 26:07.098
I was in a rock band, yeah.

26:50.909 --> 26:52.013
Hey, girls.

26:56.548 --> 26:58.926
Hey, come here.

27:01.019 --> 27:02.191
Mama.

27:02.354 --> 27:04.197
No, don't call me that,
I'm not your mom.

27:04.322 --> 27:06.165
I'm Annabel,
you can call me that.

27:07.492 --> 27:09.836
Or Annie or whatever you like.

27:13.798 --> 27:17.075
We could... We could work
it out together, right?

27:20.038 --> 27:21.073
Mama.

28:00.011 --> 28:01.149
Handsome?

29:33.671 --> 29:37.983
There are no police reports
between 2008 and 2012

29:38.042 --> 29:40.818
that match your patient's story.
And Doctor,

29:40.879 --> 29:43.792
there are no psychiatric hospitals
anywhere near Clifton Forge.

29:45.817 --> 29:47.057
Where would the closest one be?

29:47.385 --> 29:49.296
Falls Church,
200 miles from here.

29:52.056 --> 29:54.798
Now this logbook
contains records from

29:54.926 --> 29:57.702
St. Gertrude's Asylum,
up by Douthat Lake.

29:57.762 --> 29:59.605
That's 5 miles north from here.

30:00.064 --> 30:01.600
But you told me that there were

30:01.733 --> 30:03.303
no mental hospitals
in the area.

30:03.635 --> 30:08.243
There aren't. St. Gertrude's
shut down in 1878.

30:11.142 --> 30:14.680
Page 31, patient Edith Brennan.

31:29.320 --> 31:30.492
Annabel?

31:30.555 --> 31:31.625
Yep?

31:31.689 --> 31:32.895
Handsome's outside.

31:33.524 --> 31:35.333
It's all right,
I put him there.

31:35.793 --> 31:37.295
But, he's crying.

31:43.668 --> 31:44.874
Awesome.

33:01.579 --> 33:04.116
<i>There's no way these
kids are ready for this.</i>

33:04.983 --> 33:07.896
Babe, I know it's tough.
It'll get better, I promise.

33:07.952 --> 33:09.158
I don't know if I
can do this, Luke.

33:09.220 --> 33:11.530
Hey, I love you, girl.

33:34.779 --> 33:36.588
Oh, my God! Someone's here!

33:37.815 --> 33:41.729
What? Victoria? Lilly?

34:26.197 --> 34:27.437
No one's here.

34:27.498 --> 34:29.603
Someone's here.
I saw them.

34:29.667 --> 34:30.839
What, whoa, whoa, whoa,
honey, honey!

34:30.967 --> 34:32.139
I saw them!

34:32.203 --> 34:34.183
Give me the hammer.
Give me the hammer!

34:34.304 --> 34:36.306
I'll check downstairs,
you look after the girls.

35:48.813 --> 35:55.423
Lucas? Lucas?
Oh, my God! Lucas!

35:55.686 --> 35:57.996
<i>Hi, it's Vince with Slap Chop.
You can be the...</i>

36:02.059 --> 36:04.369
Chop, chop, chop. Chop, chop.

36:14.071 --> 36:16.108
I'm really sorry, Annabel.

36:18.376 --> 36:20.856
But they told me he
responded well to the tests

36:20.912 --> 36:23.620
and it's very likely
this coma's temporary.

36:24.315 --> 36:25.658
What happens now?

36:26.951 --> 36:28.726
I'm afraid I don't follow.

36:29.554 --> 36:31.727
The girls. Now that Lucas is not...
The girls.

36:31.989 --> 36:36.199
Annabel, the girls need you. They
need security, predictability.

36:36.694 --> 36:40.369
But I'm not prepared for this, I can't do this alone.
This isn't my job to do.

36:40.464 --> 36:42.501
Just grow up. If you
don't, you'll lose custody

36:42.567 --> 36:43.978
and Lucas will be
lucky if he sees

36:44.101 --> 36:45.541
his nieces every
second Thanksgiving.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.753
Well, all checked out. All the
doors and windows were locked,

36:56.814 --> 36:59.090
no evidence of an intruder,
nothing stolen, so...

36:59.150 --> 37:02.324
So I imagined it then, yeah?
All right, thank you, bud.

37:03.321 --> 37:04.595
Ma'am.

37:05.389 --> 37:06.868
Richmond's finest.

37:10.461 --> 37:13.465
Okay, guys,
just you and me for a while.

37:14.198 --> 37:19.477
I don't know how you're feeling about
that, but we don't got a choice.

38:33.010 --> 38:35.115
How have they been
affected by all of this?

38:35.179 --> 38:37.022
They are talking to the walls.

38:38.816 --> 38:40.227
What do they say?

38:41.419 --> 38:42.727
Mama.

38:57.268 --> 38:58.611
What is this?

39:00.638 --> 39:02.208
They made that.

39:12.650 --> 39:17.998
<i>They found a doll in the
cabin, Victoria. Who made the doll?</i>

39:20.925 --> 39:22.097
<i>Mama.</i>

39:23.594 --> 39:27.371
<i>The doll's called
"Mama," or Mama made the doll?</i>

39:30.000 --> 39:31.240
<i>Mama made the doll.</i>

39:31.302 --> 39:32.872
<i>And who is Mama?</i>

39:34.739 --> 39:36.514
<i>Are you "Mama", Victoria?</i>

40:01.198 --> 40:04.543
<i>- This is Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss.
- Please leave a message.</i>

40:04.602 --> 40:08.982
<i>Dr. Dreyfuss, this is Louise
from Clifton Forge Public Records.</i>

40:09.039 --> 40:12.043
<i>Hound something that
you will want to see.</i>

40:30.795 --> 40:31.830
You guys okay?

40:49.246 --> 40:50.281
What's so funny?

41:10.601 --> 41:11.602
Good night.

41:12.403 --> 41:13.404
No!

41:16.073 --> 41:17.074
Whatever.

41:22.646 --> 41:24.216
Nice butt, Bruce.

41:59.783 --> 42:03.128
Victoria! Come. Mama.

43:14.925 --> 43:16.268
You guys know what time it is?

43:19.229 --> 43:22.210
I guess you wouldn't. It's late,
it's really, really late.

43:36.547 --> 43:37.582
Don't.

43:41.685 --> 43:42.686
Don't what?

43:43.253 --> 43:44.732
Don't go in the closet.

43:48.759 --> 43:50.500
Why not?
What's in the closet?

43:54.865 --> 43:56.276
Nothing.

44:20.190 --> 44:22.397
Okay.
It's been a long day

44:22.459 --> 44:24.496
so you guys should
get some sleep. Go to bed.

44:28.766 --> 44:30.677
You want me to
leave the door open?

44:35.239 --> 44:36.240
Night.

44:43.814 --> 44:45.020
Just tell me about it.

44:47.885 --> 44:49.421
I think someone's
coming to visit them.

44:49.753 --> 44:50.754
Who?

44:51.221 --> 44:52.393
I don't know.

44:53.691 --> 44:54.726
And you believe that?

44:55.159 --> 44:56.502
I heard her.

44:56.560 --> 45:00.372
She was singing to them, it was
like a lullaby or something.

45:00.431 --> 45:03.969
You heard her?
Definitely a her?

45:04.334 --> 45:05.404
Yeah.

45:07.638 --> 45:08.844
Sound like this?

45:24.722 --> 45:28.363
Yeah, but it was... It was different.
Her voice was deeper.

45:30.327 --> 45:35.037
Victoria is showing signs of a
dissociative personality disorder.

45:35.699 --> 45:39.306
I think she could be taking on the role of Mama.
Literally becoming her.

45:40.037 --> 45:41.812
It's treatable,
with time and patience.

45:43.373 --> 45:44.852
Am I safe?

45:44.908 --> 45:48.720
What, from a crazy eight year old?
Give me a break.

46:07.231 --> 46:09.734
I found a second entry
under the name of that woman.

46:09.833 --> 46:11.073
Edith Brennan?

46:11.368 --> 46:12.870
Mad Edith Brennan.

46:14.004 --> 46:16.280
Welcome to Aisle 17, Doctor.

46:16.340 --> 46:18.877
Every archive has one,
the lost-and-found

46:19.009 --> 46:21.546
of things people
don't want to find.

46:22.379 --> 46:26.418
Twenty years ago, when they moved
the Clifton Forge cemetery,

46:26.483 --> 46:29.020
some of the oldest,
smallest remains

46:29.153 --> 46:31.759
were not claimed
by their relatives.

46:31.822 --> 46:33.699
They were sent
here to be filed.

46:34.491 --> 46:37.131
I'm not a religious person,
but I do believe

46:37.261 --> 46:39.901
there's a place
for human remains,

46:39.963 --> 46:43.501
and it's not on a shelf
in a government building.

46:54.912 --> 46:56.357
Do you believe in ghosts?

46:57.181 --> 46:58.455
I can't say that I do.

47:00.284 --> 47:06.098
When a corpse is left out, the
elements wither it, desiccate it,

47:06.990 --> 47:09.266
twisting it into
a distorted figure

47:09.393 --> 47:11.703
that is barely recognizable
as a human being.

47:12.663 --> 47:15.166
A ghost is an emotion
bent out of shape,

47:15.966 --> 47:20.108
condemned to repeat itself,
time and time again,

47:21.004 --> 47:23.814
until it rights
the wrong that was done.

47:30.514 --> 47:31.822
What's this?

47:32.249 --> 47:33.592
The wrong.

49:58.729 --> 49:59.764
Jeff?

50:00.063 --> 50:01.906
Save my girls.

50:06.236 --> 50:08.011
Go to the cabin.

50:21.685 --> 50:22.720
Code Blue!

50:22.853 --> 50:23.974
He's seizing.
Hold him still.

50:24.955 --> 50:26.434
Lorazepam, 4 milligrams.

50:26.490 --> 50:28.265
Four milligrams of Lorazepam.

50:28.325 --> 50:29.599
Is the line going?
It is.

50:29.659 --> 50:31.195
Fever?
No fever, Doctor.

50:31.261 --> 50:33.070
Mr. Desange,
can you hear me?

50:33.130 --> 50:34.734
It's okay, Mr. Desange.

50:44.808 --> 50:48.221
You kick me off the bed,
I check on the girls.

50:48.278 --> 50:50.280
That's about as
much as I remember.

50:50.414 --> 50:52.416
For all I know,
it was you who pushed me.

50:52.482 --> 50:54.484
Uh-uh.
I would have finished the job.

50:58.889 --> 51:00.300
Oh, you drew me a picture!

51:01.258 --> 51:02.362
It's a raccoon.

51:03.660 --> 51:07.107
Thank you. I drew something
for you guys, too.

51:08.965 --> 51:12.037
There you go.
You like it?

51:12.602 --> 51:13.637
Yes.

51:14.271 --> 51:19.778
That's cute. So, how was it? Was
it a tunnel with a light at the end?

51:20.310 --> 51:24.383
Oh, yeah, yeah. It was beautiful. I
was so not staying away from the light.

51:24.448 --> 51:25.552
Ha, ha, ha.

51:27.284 --> 51:30.163
So how's it been,
life as a single mom?

51:30.954 --> 51:32.126
It's great!
Yeah?

51:32.689 --> 51:34.362
It's terrible.
They hate me.

51:34.458 --> 51:35.459
They don't hate you.

51:35.559 --> 51:37.505
They hate me.
They don't hate you.

51:37.928 --> 51:40.499
So easy for you to say.
You're like the cool uncle.

51:40.564 --> 51:42.237
I am the cool uncle.

51:45.435 --> 51:47.278
What? What is it, Annie?

51:48.438 --> 51:49.644
Just get well soon
so you can come home

51:49.706 --> 51:50.946
and clean up
their mess, please.

51:52.008 --> 51:53.282
You sure that's it?

51:54.978 --> 51:56.286
Yeah.

52:05.989 --> 52:07.195
You okay?

52:12.929 --> 52:15.102
What are you doing in here?

52:16.633 --> 52:18.840
Here. I'll help.

52:25.342 --> 52:26.252
What is it?

52:27.043 --> 52:28.613
I don't want you to get hurt.

52:29.212 --> 52:30.520
What do you mean?

52:32.315 --> 52:35.159
I'm fine. Nothing bad's
gonna happen to me.

52:35.218 --> 52:36.720
You can't do that!

52:37.154 --> 52:38.189
Why?

52:38.622 --> 52:40.101
'Cause she gets jealous.

52:54.371 --> 52:55.406
Hey, wait!

52:58.708 --> 52:59.846
What's wrong with you?

53:07.017 --> 53:08.155
Oh!

53:08.218 --> 53:10.994
Hey, Jean. Um...
How can I help?

53:12.656 --> 53:13.691
It's my day.

53:14.624 --> 53:16.264
Are you sure? I thought
that was Thursday.

53:16.893 --> 53:18.201
It is Thursday.

53:18.495 --> 53:19.769
Sorry about the mess.

53:19.829 --> 53:23.641
Children make mess. That's how it works.
How are they?

53:23.700 --> 53:25.907
Outdoorsy.
You want coffee?

53:25.969 --> 53:27.175
Thank you.

53:30.340 --> 53:32.946
Oh, my God.
What is this?

53:33.977 --> 53:36.082
Yeah, I know,
they're wild sometimes.

53:36.146 --> 53:37.386
It's not an excuse.

53:39.015 --> 53:42.121
Hey, now. They're bruises.
Kids get bruised.

53:42.185 --> 53:43.323
This bruised?

53:43.420 --> 53:45.093
It's not like that.

53:46.590 --> 53:47.660
Let me have them.

53:47.857 --> 53:48.892
Sorry?

53:48.959 --> 53:50.029
Just for a few days.

53:50.093 --> 53:54.132
You can, I don't know,
play with your band,

53:54.331 --> 53:56.675
have a drink with
your friends...

53:57.934 --> 54:00.813
Jean, I think it's great

54:00.870 --> 54:02.178
that the girls have a
relationship with their aunt,

54:02.239 --> 54:04.549
I really, really do,
but right now,

54:04.608 --> 54:06.918
you need to get out of my
house before I kick your ass.

54:14.551 --> 54:16.189
I'll see you both
real soon, okay?

54:18.154 --> 54:19.360
Hey!

54:21.725 --> 54:23.136
Have you been
coming around here?

54:23.193 --> 54:24.365
I beg your pardon?

54:24.427 --> 54:26.236
You been coming to the house,
playing with the girls?

54:26.296 --> 54:27.570
Of course not. Why?

54:29.933 --> 54:31.139
Doesn't matter.

54:35.272 --> 54:38.617
<i>Richmond.
Social Services.</i>

54:38.875 --> 54:40.081
Uh...

54:40.210 --> 54:43.783
Who should I speak to if I believe
my nieces are being abused?

54:46.950 --> 54:51.626
Well, what kind of evidence
do I need exactly?

54:52.822 --> 54:54.392
How the hell did you forget?

54:54.457 --> 54:56.095
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

54:56.159 --> 54:58.662
You know she wants
to take the girls from us!

54:58.728 --> 55:01.937
I'm exhausted, I'm sorry,
I forgot today was her day.

55:02.232 --> 55:06.647
Jesus Christ, Annie, it's one
visit, it's not much to remember.

55:07.971 --> 55:10.383
Annie, listen, they’re just
kids, all you got to do is...

55:10.440 --> 55:12.386
What? Chill out?
Take it easy?

55:12.442 --> 55:16.083
You know, I can't do this, this is not my job.
This is your job.

55:16.146 --> 55:18.752
I am out of here in a day, just
hold it together until then.

55:18.815 --> 55:20.726
All right, fine, yeah,
we'll see what happens then.

55:20.784 --> 55:22.627
I'll take care them,
those girls are

55:22.752 --> 55:24.595
the most important
thing in the world to me.

55:27.290 --> 55:28.997
Awesome.
Annie, you...

55:42.339 --> 55:45.912
Okay, Victoria,
are you nice and relaxed?

55:47.811 --> 55:49.552
Are you feeling sleepy?

55:53.883 --> 55:55.590
I'd like you to
tell me about Mama.

55:58.154 --> 55:59.997
Did she live in
that house with you?

56:02.058 --> 56:03.935
The house by that lake?

56:08.832 --> 56:10.505
Where did she live?

56:16.506 --> 56:17.712
In the walls.

56:20.677 --> 56:22.179
Where is she now?

56:26.316 --> 56:27.795
I don't know.

56:29.085 --> 56:32.225
I think you know.
I think you know where she is.

56:36.593 --> 56:41.667
Where is she, Victoria?
Is she here in this house?

56:41.998 --> 56:43.204
Did she come with you?

56:46.403 --> 56:47.643
Open your eyes, Victoria.

56:50.206 --> 56:52.584
Look at this photograph.
Is this Mama?

56:54.310 --> 56:55.448
Is this Mama, Victoria?

56:55.545 --> 56:57.024
Go away!
Tell me about her!

56:57.080 --> 56:58.184
No!
Yes!

57:25.375 --> 57:26.581
What's going on?

57:27.010 --> 57:28.614
Nothing, nothing's going on.

57:28.678 --> 57:29.884
Gerald, what happened?

57:30.246 --> 57:32.283
I have to go.
I'll call you.

57:48.698 --> 57:49.768
<i>November 3rd.</i>

57:52.202 --> 57:54.204
<i>The seventh session
was more than revealing.</i>

57:55.538 --> 57:57.415
<i>I think I have found a door,</i>

57:57.474 --> 58:01.388
<i>a passage, that connects Helvetia
and the Desange's house.</i>

58:04.981 --> 58:07.825
<i>There is no rational explanation
that supports this theory,</i>

58:08.418 --> 58:12.366
<i>but it is only the ability
to embrace a different reality</i>

58:12.455 --> 58:15.800
<i>that makes science expand beyond
the limits of what we know.</i>

58:22.799 --> 58:27.441
<i>However, extraordinary claims
require extraordinary proof.</i>

58:28.638 --> 58:31.949
<i>I now feel closer than ever to
the real subject of my research.</i>

58:32.876 --> 58:37.018
<i>I will come back from Clifton
Forge with an answer.</i>

01:00:50.613 --> 01:00:51.785
What's wrong?

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:06.539
What's under the bed?
Victoria?

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:16.040
Victoria! Come! Mama!

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:29.652
Victoria! Come! Mama!

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.263
Victoria stay.

01:03:13.556 --> 01:03:14.728
Mama?

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:19.435
Where Mama?

01:03:58.634 --> 01:03:59.942
I know your name.

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:04.179
I know what you want.

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:13.747
Lilly!

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:19.056
Lilly, Lilly, are you okay?

01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:21.154
How did you get down here?

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:27.798
You're shitting me. Are you shitting me?
Come here, crazy!

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:32.634
Okay.

01:05:39.669 --> 01:05:42.309
Stop!
Stop it!

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.720
Stop!

01:05:57.653 --> 01:05:59.690
It's okay. Come on.

01:06:00.389 --> 01:06:05.236
Come on, come on,
come on, now...

01:06:09.565 --> 01:06:11.567
Okay. Come here.

01:06:27.883 --> 01:06:28.953
What?

01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:35.829
You like that?

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:53.847
Okay!

01:07:13.496 --> 01:07:16.602
Okay, door is good,
window is bad.

01:07:16.665 --> 01:07:19.009
So if we want to go outside,
what do we do?

01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:21.414
Use the stairs?

01:07:21.771 --> 01:07:23.375
Right. Lilly?

01:07:25.374 --> 01:07:26.478
Use the stairs?

01:07:30.212 --> 01:07:34.285
Yeah. That's excellent.
Okay, let's go get breakfast.

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:44.596
Oh! God!

01:07:46.162 --> 01:07:48.108
Lilly, you scared
the crap out of me.

01:07:50.533 --> 01:07:52.945
Annabel! Breakfast is ready!

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:55.605
I'll be right down!

01:07:57.373 --> 01:08:00.252
Annabel! Lilly's hungry!

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:06.979
Annabel?

01:09:13.448 --> 01:09:14.894
Yeah.

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:31.977
Victoria? You and Dr. Dreyfuss,
you guys talk some...

01:09:32.968 --> 01:09:36.006
I mean, you guys
talked a lot, right?

01:09:44.145 --> 01:09:46.752
Victoria, Dr. Dreyfuss and I,
we talked some, too.

01:09:48.283 --> 01:09:49.388
We talked about Mama.

01:09:51.819 --> 01:09:56.496
You and Dr. Dreyfuss, you... You
guys talked about Mama, too, right?

01:10:03.632 --> 01:10:05.578
Who is Mama, Victoria?

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:14.749
- This is Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss.
- Please leave a message.

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:17.484
Hey, it's Annabel,
I need to talk to you,

01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:21.187
so please call me whenever you
get this, okay? Thanks, bye.

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:09.432
Yes, I talked to
Lieutenant Spencer two hours ago.

01:11:10.466 --> 01:11:14.243
I'm sure you are.
I just don't understand.

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:18.445
I am afraid that something bad
may have happened to the doctor.

01:11:25.414 --> 01:11:26.449
You okay?

01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:37.800
Stay there.

01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:56.148
Come on, get your coats.

01:12:29.945 --> 01:12:35.019
Richmond. I need the number for
Enterprise Rent-A-Car. Yeah.

01:14:23.959 --> 01:14:26.439
<i>I want you
to tell me the story again.</i>

01:14:30.098 --> 01:14:31.509
<i>Can you tell me the story?</i>

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.739
<i>It was a longtime ago.</i>

01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:36.248
<i>A lady ran away from a
hospital for sad people.</i>

01:14:37.573 --> 01:14:41.419
<i>She took her baby,
They jumped into the water.</i>

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:46.320
<i>How could you know that story, Victoria?
Did Mama tell you that story?</i>

01:14:48.717 --> 01:14:49.957
<i>She showed me.</i>

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:51.829
<i>How?</i>

01:14:51.887 --> 01:14:52.991
<i>In a dream.</i>

01:14:53.288 --> 01:14:54.358
<i>Go on.</i>

01:14:54.623 --> 01:14:58.662
<i>She fell into the water,
but the baby didn't.</i>

01:15:00.429 --> 01:15:01.407
<i>Why?</i>

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:03.899
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:06.874
<i>What could have
happened to the baby, Victoria?</i>

01:15:07.302 --> 01:15:08.372
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:15:10.405 --> 01:15:11.850
<i>Mama didn't show you?</i>

01:15:15.043 --> 01:15:17.148
<i>She doesn't know
what happened to her baby.</i>

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:27.701
<i>She went walking in the
woods, looking for it.</i>

01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:30.894
<i>She searched for
a very long time.</i>

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:32.530
<i>And then?</i>

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:35.134
<i>Then she found us.</i>

01:15:36.164 --> 01:15:37.541
<i>Why are you crying, Victoria?</i>

01:15:38.967 --> 01:15:40.571
<i>'Cause she's sad.</i>

01:15:47.309 --> 01:15:49.915
<i>Is she sad, or are
you sad, Victoria?</i>

01:15:52.047 --> 01:15:55.722
<i>Where is Mama?
Is she here, with us?</i>

01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.765
<i>Can you show me Mama?</i>

01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:01.632
<i>She won't come here.</i>

01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:03.298
<i>Why not?</i>

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.231
<i>Because she knows
you're watching.</i>

01:16:37.626 --> 01:16:41.733
<i>This is Annabel. Leave
your message at the beep. Fuck you! Beep!</i>

01:16:51.907 --> 01:16:53.079
Annabel?

01:16:54.009 --> 01:16:55.010
Oh.

01:16:55.644 --> 01:16:57.214
Hey, Victoria.

01:16:58.213 --> 01:16:59.283
Are you okay?

01:17:00.248 --> 01:17:01.693
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:26.009
Good night, Annabel.

01:17:30.045 --> 01:17:31.422
I love you.

01:17:34.216 --> 01:17:35.286
No.

01:19:55.857 --> 01:19:57.029
Lilly!

01:20:01.263 --> 01:20:02.469
Lilly!

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:11.244
Don't look at her!

01:20:15.977 --> 01:20:17.354
She's mad.

01:20:18.113 --> 01:20:21.026
Run! Lilly!

01:20:25.587 --> 01:20:26.793
Lilly!

01:20:29.057 --> 01:20:32.038
Lilly, open the door!

01:20:47.309 --> 01:20:48.344
Victoria!
What's going on?

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:49.684
Are you okay?

01:20:49.811 --> 01:20:51.119
Annabel! It's Lilly!

01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:56.590
Lilly? Are you okay?

01:20:56.651 --> 01:20:57.959
Huh?

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:32.121
Mama! Stop it!

01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:34.159
You promised!

01:21:39.127 --> 01:21:40.765
Leave her alone!

01:22:33.548 --> 01:22:36.893
Annabel! Annabel!

01:23:36.044 --> 01:23:37.546
Aunt Jean?

01:23:43.485 --> 01:23:44.828
Are you okay?

01:24:46.815 --> 01:24:47.885
Lilly?

01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:53.727
Victoria?

01:25:24.886 --> 01:25:26.888
<i>Hey, this
is Lucas, leave a message.</i>

01:25:27.689 --> 01:25:30.863
Lucas, she has the girls.
I am heading to Clifton Forge.

01:25:37.599 --> 01:25:38.703
Luke?

01:25:39.734 --> 01:25:40.769
Luke!

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:42.804
Baby!

01:25:42.937 --> 01:25:43.938
I got your message.

01:25:44.372 --> 01:25:46.079
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:25:47.408 --> 01:25:48.769
Where are the girls?
She took them.

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:50.517
What?
I saw her, she's real.

01:25:50.578 --> 01:25:51.750
What the hell is happening?

01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:53.554
She's going to kill them.
We gotta get to the cabin.

01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:57.922
She was here with them the whole time.
Dr. Dreyfuss knew it.

01:25:57.986 --> 01:25:59.260
Oh, God!

01:26:23.878 --> 01:26:25.050
Jean?

01:26:50.205 --> 01:26:51.548
They're on the cliff!

01:27:18.266 --> 01:27:19.973
Victoria! Lilly!

01:27:23.605 --> 01:27:24.709
No.

01:27:32.513 --> 01:27:33.514
No, no.

01:27:33.615 --> 01:27:34.753
Mama!

01:27:34.882 --> 01:27:36.020
No. Lilly! Lilly!

01:27:36.784 --> 01:27:37.785
No!

01:27:46.361 --> 01:27:47.499
Mama!

01:27:50.598 --> 01:27:51.941
Edith!

01:29:17.018 --> 01:29:18.156
Mama!
No!

01:29:20.655 --> 01:29:21.861
Lilly?

01:29:51.352 --> 01:29:52.831
Mama, no! Mama!

01:30:01.195 --> 01:30:02.230
Mama!

01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:22.759
Stay here.

01:30:29.624 --> 01:30:30.625
Bye, Annabel.

01:30:40.067 --> 01:30:41.102
Sleep, Annabel!

01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:45.448
Victoria, Lilly.

01:31:15.903 --> 01:31:17.849
- Sleep, Annabel.
- Sleep.

01:31:24.545 --> 01:31:25.580
Sleep.

01:32:07.154 --> 01:32:08.497
Goodbye, Mama,

01:32:10.591 --> 01:32:11.865
I love you.

01:32:17.832 --> 01:32:20.039
Victoria, come.

01:32:21.335 --> 01:32:22.814
Victoria stay.

01:32:24.805 --> 01:32:29.151
Come, Lilly, Mama, Victoria.

01:32:29.877 --> 01:32:34.257
No, Lilly, Mama.

01:32:43.057 --> 01:32:45.799
Lilly! Lilly!

01:32:46.193 --> 01:32:48.195
Victoria, no!

01:32:48.529 --> 01:32:51.305
Lilly! Lilly!

01:32:51.766 --> 01:32:53.677
No! Please! No!

01:32:53.801 --> 01:32:55.712
Lilly!

01:32:55.770 --> 01:32:58.216
Oh, God, bring her back!

01:32:59.707 --> 01:33:01.084
Baby!

01:33:01.142 --> 01:33:02.621
Lilly!

01:33:13.554 --> 01:33:15.056
Oh, my God!

01:33:16.691 --> 01:33:18.034
Oh, God!

01:33:19.393 --> 01:33:20.565
No.

01:33:28.069 --> 01:33:29.241
No!

01:34:29.764 --> 01:34:30.834
Luke?

01:34:42.777 --> 01:34:43.983
Lilly?
