WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.869
I'm Ralph dineen,
and for my civics project,

00:02.870 --> 00:05.738
I'm interviewing average
American voters on election day.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.775
Sir, I'm researching
what issues

00:09.777 --> 00:11.377
concern
the average American.

00:11.379 --> 00:13.445
I'm not an American
yet and if I was,

00:13.447 --> 00:15.614
my IQ makes me
well above average.

00:15.616 --> 00:16.648
Seriously?

00:16.650 --> 00:18.350
This is for a grade.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.052
Oh, right.

00:20.054 --> 00:21.787
Well, if I were a citizen,

00:21.789 --> 00:24.390
my concern would be
how slow the patent

00:24.392 --> 00:25.657
and trademark office is.

00:25.659 --> 00:26.975
I've been waiting for approval

00:26.976 --> 00:28.292
on several of my inventions
for some time.

00:28.295 --> 00:30.279
You see, I've created

00:30.280 --> 00:32.264
multiple, unique innovations
that will ultimately shape

00:32.266 --> 00:33.565
the course of...
No one likes your inventions.

00:33.567 --> 00:34.566
Cabe:
Come here, ralphy.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.068
Get me on camera.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.337
Cameraman, new subject.

00:40.141 --> 00:41.040
And here we have someone

00:41.042 --> 00:42.041
who's been voting

00:42.043 --> 00:43.075
for almost a half a century.

00:43.077 --> 00:44.643
Not relevant.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.512
Now the issue
that concerns me

00:46.514 --> 00:47.579
is technology.

00:47.581 --> 00:48.680
For example,

00:48.682 --> 00:49.782
the other day,
i was trying to get

00:49.784 --> 00:52.151
happy's Wi-Fi thermostat
to work.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.385
A child can use it.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.686
Wrong.

00:54.688 --> 00:55.821
So, I called Toby

00:55.823 --> 00:57.289
to help me with it.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.824
He had me shout 72 degrees

00:58.826 --> 01:00.292
into that thing over and over

01:00.294 --> 01:01.727
and it never kicked in,
did it, doc?

01:01.729 --> 01:03.228
(Laughs)

01:05.199 --> 01:06.732
What?

01:06.733 --> 01:08.266
Thermostat isn't
voice-activated.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.737
I screamed into that crap pile

01:11.739 --> 01:12.738
for 20 minutes.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.640
(Laughing)

01:15.609 --> 01:16.742
Not everything's improved

01:16.744 --> 01:18.710
by technology, ralphy.

01:18.712 --> 01:21.647
My top issue on election day:
Surveillance.

01:21.649 --> 01:22.748
The bad guys

01:22.750 --> 01:23.849
watch our every move,

01:23.851 --> 01:25.451
but who watches the watchers?

01:25.453 --> 01:28.387
You're what my teacher
calls the crackpot vote.

01:28.389 --> 01:29.288
(Snorts)

01:30.157 --> 01:31.623
(Clears throat)

01:31.625 --> 01:33.225
Check it out.

01:33.227 --> 01:37.096
Titanium crib,
hydraulic lifts...

01:38.399 --> 01:39.832
...dozens of pinhole,

01:39.834 --> 01:41.800
fiber-optic cameras
that line the frame.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.519
They're pointing out,

01:43.520 --> 01:45.237
not at the baby. What, do you
plan on watching daddy?

01:45.239 --> 01:47.272
I want to make sure
you don't drop it.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.841
You're worried about me?

01:48.843 --> 01:50.676
You just referred
to our child as "it."

01:50.678 --> 01:52.478
Hey, and speaking of the

01:52.480 --> 01:53.612
fetus-i-can't-wait-to-meet-us,

01:53.614 --> 01:55.481
when is your overdue
prenatal checkup?

01:55.483 --> 01:57.749
It's this afternoon
and it's not overdue.

01:57.751 --> 02:00.285
I'm at three weeks,
within standard time frame.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.620
Yeah, this seems personal.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.005
Should I stop filming?

02:03.006 --> 02:04.389
I'll tell you
when to stop filming.

02:06.494 --> 02:07.893
Eminent domain law.

02:07.895 --> 02:09.595
That's what concerns me.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.230
I am researching
the subject now.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.264
Our government

02:12.266 --> 02:13.732
has draconian seizure power.

02:14.702 --> 02:15.767
What, no follow up?

02:15.769 --> 02:17.870
I'm just shocked
i got a real answer.

02:17.872 --> 02:19.471
Last night,

02:19.473 --> 02:22.241
during a spirited bout
of fantasies and frolics,

02:22.243 --> 02:24.243
a-a role-playing
imagination game...

02:24.245 --> 02:25.644
Shut it down.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.713
My wizardry coven...

02:27.715 --> 02:28.780
The knights of west altadenia,

02:28.782 --> 02:29.915
learned that
the comic book store

02:29.917 --> 02:31.717
where we convene...
Merlin's credenza?

02:31.719 --> 02:33.919
The warlock's chest,
thank you kindly.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.487
Our beloved lair

02:35.489 --> 02:37.389
has been marked for destruction

02:37.391 --> 02:39.858
in order to make space
for a big-box hardware store

02:39.860 --> 02:40.859
to be built.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.194
Sweet.
Cheaper tools.

02:42.196 --> 02:43.295
Happy!

02:43.297 --> 02:44.730
The warlock's chest

02:44.732 --> 02:46.899
is a haven
for the socially challenged.

02:46.901 --> 02:48.534
Some people

02:48.536 --> 02:49.735
vote their pocketbook.

02:49.737 --> 02:52.304
I vote my comic book.

02:52.306 --> 02:53.805
And I will support
any politician

02:53.807 --> 02:55.674
that will rein in
eminent domain abuse.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.442
Paige:
Oh, I'm so sorry.

02:57.444 --> 02:58.677
Lots of people
voting before work.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.746
Thanks for watching Ralph.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.581
How'd the civics project go?
Ralph: Awful.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.883
I got to go edit this crap pile.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.386
Uh, where did he
learn a word like that?

03:13.260 --> 03:14.693
See you got your dress

03:14.695 --> 03:15.794
for the veteran's ball.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.496
Uh, and Ralph's suit, too.

03:17.498 --> 03:18.964
Oh, uh, thanks again
for asking him to come.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.432
Oh, I wouldn't think
of going without him.

03:20.434 --> 03:21.967
Actually, we might have

03:21.969 --> 03:23.902
a little more company.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.370
Really? Who?

03:25.372 --> 03:27.239
My... parents

03:27.241 --> 03:29.441
are in L.A.
for a few days

03:29.443 --> 03:31.310
and they were wondering if they
could come to the event as well.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.578
Paige: Oh, to the, um,
to the ball?

03:32.580 --> 03:34.080
Tim:
Yeah.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.581
I mean, listen, if it's
weird or something, then,

03:35.583 --> 03:36.949
oh, it's not weird,
it's not weird.
I mean...

03:36.950 --> 03:38.316
They're just in town...
No, I totally get it.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.318
It'll be, it'll be fun.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.485
Tim: Great.

03:40.487 --> 03:42.321
Okay, I will let them know.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.855
In the meantime, I should
go help Ralph edit.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.657
He is a demanding boss.
(Chuckles)

03:49.730 --> 03:51.697
Ooh, wow.

03:51.699 --> 03:54.466
Introducing our Ms. dineen
to mom and dad

03:54.468 --> 03:56.001
is quite the bold move
by Timothy.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.636
It's quite bold, indeed.

03:57.637 --> 03:59.270
I am really not
looking for commentary.

03:59.273 --> 04:01.607
I didn't meet Megan's parents
until after I married her.

04:01.609 --> 04:02.874
Speaking of marriage,

04:02.876 --> 04:05.010
chew on these
sociological stats.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.512
You know, over half of those
who have a formal meeting

04:07.514 --> 04:09.481
with their paramour's parents
past the age of 29

04:09.483 --> 04:10.716
wind up engaged.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.351
And 82%

04:12.353 --> 04:13.785
of those folk take the plunge.

04:13.787 --> 04:14.820
Marriage?!

04:14.822 --> 04:16.255
It's just a dance.

04:16.257 --> 04:17.289
A dance down

04:17.291 --> 04:18.290
the aisle.

04:18.292 --> 04:19.458
And since married people

04:19.460 --> 04:21.593
under 40 have children
at a 66% clip,

04:21.595 --> 04:23.929
the question is not

04:23.931 --> 04:25.697
"are you ready
to meet the parents?"

04:25.699 --> 04:27.432
It's "are you ready
for another bambino?"

04:27.434 --> 04:28.433
What?!

04:28.435 --> 04:30.185
Walter:
Guys, Paige is bright.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.936
She wouldn't allow something
as trivial as a-a dance

04:31.939 --> 04:33.505
to determine the course
of her life.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.507
So, perhaps, we butt out?

04:35.509 --> 04:36.575
Thank you, Walter.

04:36.577 --> 04:37.576
Walter:
You're welcome.

04:37.578 --> 04:38.810
Besides, we don't even know

04:38.812 --> 04:40.279
if Paige and Tim
have been intimate yet.

04:40.281 --> 04:41.280
Oh, my god.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.048
Man:
Excuse me.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.284
Is cabe gallo here?
Paige:
Oh, great.

04:45.286 --> 04:46.785
A case. Hopefully,
the world's about to explode

04:46.787 --> 04:48.320
so we can end this conversation.

04:48.322 --> 04:49.454
I'm gallo.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.289
You FBI?

04:50.291 --> 04:51.623
Agent backheim.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.609
This is agent hart,
agent govelli.

04:53.610 --> 04:55.594
White house sent us
on an extremely urgent matter.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.779
What's going on?

04:56.780 --> 04:57.963
Sorry, Mr. o'brien, but
you were recently flagged

04:57.965 --> 04:59.882
by U.S. citizenship

04:59.883 --> 05:01.800
and immigration services as
a person of interest and as such

05:01.802 --> 05:02.801
you can't be involved
in this case.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.670
Preposterous.
He's worked

05:04.672 --> 05:06.505
on dozens of
government cases.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.673
All before being suspected

05:07.675 --> 05:08.824
of citizenship fraud.

05:08.825 --> 05:09.974
Linehan.
Backheim:
We just found out

05:09.977 --> 05:11.043
about this on our way here.

05:11.045 --> 05:12.077
Frankly, we would prefer to have

05:12.079 --> 05:13.295
scorpion at full strength,

05:13.296 --> 05:14.512
but we don't have time
to negotiate

05:14.515 --> 05:15.681
Mr. o'brien's inclusion.

05:15.683 --> 05:16.615
We need to move...

05:16.617 --> 05:17.883
Asap.
Sorry, agents

05:17.885 --> 05:20.052
backside, fart
and go-smell-me.

05:20.054 --> 05:21.553
Backheim, hart, govelli.

05:21.555 --> 05:22.554
Toby:
Scorpion's a team.

05:22.556 --> 05:23.989
You don't break up
the Beatles,

05:23.991 --> 05:25.841
so go pound sand.

05:25.842 --> 05:27.692
The president personally
asked for your team.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.861
He expects cooperation.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.833
This is
from the big man himself.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.535
You need to
take this job

05:36.537 --> 05:37.969
if scorpion's ever gonna get

05:37.971 --> 05:39.571
another government
gig again.

05:39.573 --> 05:40.572
Happy:
Would be good to know

05:40.574 --> 05:41.840
what the gig is.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.125
Not with Mr. o'brien here,

05:43.126 --> 05:44.409
and I can't waste any more time
on this issue.

05:44.411 --> 05:45.777
We just learned
about the situation

05:45.779 --> 05:46.978
in question 90 minutes ago

05:46.980 --> 05:47.979
and it's acute.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.114
This is absurd.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.115
Take the job.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.950
I'll be fine.
Backheim: Good.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.586
And to make sure you stay
that way, agent hart will remain

05:54.588 --> 05:55.954
with you here to make sure
that you're not tempted

05:55.956 --> 05:57.989
to jump on your computer
or contact your team

05:57.991 --> 05:59.358
in any way.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.709
But if he does,
you'll shoot him?

06:00.710 --> 06:02.059
No, we'll shoot
the computer.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.497
Your cell phone.
And the comm

06:05.499 --> 06:07.933
we're well aware your
team is prone to use.

06:09.636 --> 06:11.603
Backheim: You can follow
us to the location.

06:11.605 --> 06:12.704
It's not far.

06:12.706 --> 06:13.772
We'll fill you in
when we get there.

06:16.643 --> 06:18.009
Um, Ralph's school

06:18.011 --> 06:19.711
is closed due to the election,
so can you watch him?

06:19.713 --> 06:21.580
Oh, of course, yeah.

06:21.582 --> 06:22.714
Good luck.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.550
It's so weird you
can't come with.

06:27.654 --> 06:29.104
Government is shady.

06:29.105 --> 06:30.555
I told you we need
to watch the watchers.

06:34.027 --> 06:36.027
(Tires screech)

06:36.029 --> 06:37.462
All right, let me guess.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.064
You want us to help
unpack these containers?

06:39.066 --> 06:40.932
Your task involves a
different kind of storage.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.601
Have you ever heard
of penter counting systems

06:42.603 --> 06:44.069
out of silicon beach?
Penter?

06:44.071 --> 06:45.771
Like the voting machine
i used this morning?
Exactly.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.906
Penter supplies all U.S.
electronic voting machines.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.875
Tabulations are stored
on massive servers

06:49.877 --> 06:51.810
that are currently
running at 35% slower

06:51.812 --> 06:53.100
than they're capable.

06:53.101 --> 06:54.389
We can't have
anything go wrong

06:54.390 --> 06:55.678
with the election tallies,
so we need you to fix it.

06:55.682 --> 06:56.848
I read in the paper
that this is

06:56.850 --> 06:58.784
the first election year
where all votes,

06:58.786 --> 07:01.153
nationwide, will be
calculated on one system.

07:01.155 --> 07:02.187
In the paper?

07:02.189 --> 07:03.689
When? On the way
to the soda fountain

07:03.690 --> 07:05.190
to get an egg cream?
Yes. The election commission

07:05.192 --> 07:06.925
decided to streamline
the process.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.560
Well, that's the problem.

07:08.561 --> 07:10.194
There's a huge amount of data
hitting the system today.

07:10.197 --> 07:11.663
It's overheating,
that's why it's slowing down.

07:11.665 --> 07:12.664
Well, that is a problem

07:12.666 --> 07:13.765
because by this afternoon,

07:13.767 --> 07:15.000
as is customary,

07:15.002 --> 07:16.501
eastern Kentucky polls are gonna

07:16.503 --> 07:17.803
start reporting their results.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.105
The rest of the
states will follow.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.640
Any additional data

07:21.642 --> 07:23.608
will slow the server even more,
maybe crash it.

07:23.610 --> 07:24.910
Which we can't have since
the server contains

07:24.912 --> 07:25.911
the winner of the election.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.112
What I want to know is

07:27.114 --> 07:28.547
why we're<i> on the waterfront.</i>

07:28.549 --> 07:29.948
Did you see that
picture, cabe?

07:29.950 --> 07:31.917
Or have you not
warmed up to talkies?

07:31.919 --> 07:32.951
Cabe, the silent,
government man

07:32.953 --> 07:34.753
would like us to enter

07:34.755 --> 07:36.855
the dark container at
the back of the docks.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.690
After you.

07:45.566 --> 07:46.865
Server's down there.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.835
Oh, cool.
An underwater data farm.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.803
The ocean water's
cooling properties

07:51.805 --> 07:53.872
regulate
the equipment's temperature.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.106
And the motion of water

07:55.108 --> 07:56.541
captures the hydrokinetic energy

07:56.543 --> 07:57.976
as a backup power source.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.045
And since penter's just up

08:00.046 --> 08:02.113
the coast on silicon beach,
there's no latency issue,

08:02.115 --> 08:04.549
as data doesn't have to travel
far to get to the server.

08:04.551 --> 08:06.218
Most importantly,
the data's hidden

08:06.219 --> 08:07.886
just ten yards off the coast,
50 feet underwater.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.622
Now if you'll follow me,

08:10.624 --> 08:12.858
we need to find out why a server
in freezing water

08:12.860 --> 08:13.859
is still overheating.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.961
And do it fast.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.999
The world court will be ruling
next week on who controls

08:21.001 --> 08:23.869
lucrative stretches
of new arctic shipping lanes.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.871
It's a priority
for the president

08:25.873 --> 08:27.639
and something
he can only see through

08:27.641 --> 08:30.742
if he wins today's hotly
contested election.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.577
The president will be
in his home city

08:32.579 --> 08:34.513
of Los Angeles
through the afternoon.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.548
And in other news,
local voting precincts

08:36.550 --> 08:39.251
are reporting long lines
as the public shows up

08:39.253 --> 08:40.886
in record numbers

08:40.888 --> 08:42.754
to cast their votes

08:42.756 --> 08:43.755
for this 2016...

08:43.757 --> 08:44.890
Let me borrow your tablet.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.758
I got to know what
they're working on.

08:46.760 --> 08:47.959
...he and the first lady

08:47.961 --> 08:49.294
will have cast their votes

08:49.296 --> 08:50.829
while in Los Angeles today.

08:50.831 --> 08:54.032
However, his public polling
place is not disclosed.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.767
Hopefully, he won't be
in long lines

08:55.769 --> 08:57.068
like everyone else

08:57.070 --> 08:58.169
across the...
Bang!

08:58.171 --> 08:59.905
You're busted.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.573
Lucky I didn't shoot it.

09:03.277 --> 09:04.843
Ooh.

09:04.845 --> 09:07.312
You got in trouble.

09:10.317 --> 09:11.883
50 digit code.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.019
It'll take a moment.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.090
I'm dying to sing
"under the sea" right now,

09:19.092 --> 09:20.258
but I'm not, so there.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.326
Maturity.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.796
We're in.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.302
Paige:
Wow, this is amazing.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.343
Ooh.

09:38.345 --> 09:40.712
Ow, your server's got a fever.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.280
(Computer beeping)

09:43.784 --> 09:44.916
What's wrong?

09:44.918 --> 09:46.017
This server isn't overheating

09:46.019 --> 09:47.285
from the data coming in.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.853
It's from the data
going out.

09:48.855 --> 09:50.288
There is a bug

09:50.290 --> 09:52.824
on this server that
is effectively removing

09:52.826 --> 09:56.695
the software that counts
and collates every single vote

09:56.697 --> 09:57.796
that has been cast.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.664
Oh, crap.

09:59.666 --> 10:01.166
Someone is sucking the info
from this server.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.668
And once whoever

10:02.669 --> 10:04.169
planted the bug gets it,
they can change it

10:04.171 --> 10:05.770
however they want
and then put it back in.

10:07.307 --> 10:08.373
Are you saying someone's

10:08.375 --> 10:10.342
trying to manipulate
the election?

10:10.344 --> 10:11.810
No, they're not "trying."

10:11.812 --> 10:13.712
They're doing it as we speak.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.780
♪ ♪

10:23.223 --> 10:25.857
Sly, on a scale of
milli vanilli to madoff:

10:25.859 --> 10:27.092
How certain this is fraud?

10:27.094 --> 10:28.893
Enron certain.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.695
Paige:
Oh, boy.

10:30.697 --> 10:33.298
That's a lot of fraud.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.133
The right to vote is sacrosanct
to the American psyche.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.868
If vote tallies are corrupted,

10:36.870 --> 10:38.770
the damage to our national
trust level will be...

10:38.772 --> 10:40.905
Not good.
If people believe
that their vote

10:40.907 --> 10:42.407
might be compromised,
they'll stop going to the polls.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.976
We can't have that. A strong
nation is an engaged one.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.878
We got to shut this down,
quietly.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.880
I think I found a way to start.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.415
I tracked the ip address

10:50.417 --> 10:52.017
from where the malware
was initiated.

10:52.019 --> 10:54.753
It's at the headquarters
of the anc--

10:54.755 --> 10:55.888
the American news channel.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.022
Maybe whoever did it
is still there.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.390
Let's go!

11:00.861 --> 11:02.160
What are you doing?

11:02.162 --> 11:03.762
Ralph:
Solving ulam's spiral.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.297
The prime numbers
form diagonal lines.

11:06.299 --> 11:08.266
No one knows why.

11:08.268 --> 11:11.036
I think it denotes an inherent
order to the universe.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.737
Speaking of order...

11:12.739 --> 11:15.774
I need to know more about what
my team is doing.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.709
I think I know
how we can find out.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.444
But, I will need a partner.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.445
Are you game?

11:20.447 --> 11:23.048
I'm your man.
Perfect.

11:23.050 --> 11:26.151
First, we'll need some supplies
for your science project.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.420
I don't have
a science project due.

11:28.422 --> 11:29.954
Well, you do now.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.759
Cabe: We appreciate you
allowing access

11:34.761 --> 11:36.828
on such short notice,
Ms. Hampton.

11:36.830 --> 11:40.365
When homeland and the FBI call,
we try to accommodate.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.934
You really think a hack was
perpetrated on our premises?

11:42.936 --> 11:44.335
We don't think, we know.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.705
It-it doesn't mean it
was an employee.

11:46.707 --> 11:49.207
Could have been a visitor,
an outside contractor,

11:49.209 --> 11:50.475
someone who snuck in...
(Phone ringing)

11:50.477 --> 11:52.077
Go for backheim.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.779
Yeah, I have to take this.
I'll be back.

11:53.780 --> 11:55.480
Ms. Hampton, we're just looking
for digital bread crumbs.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.215
We narrowed the ip address
to the eighth floor,

11:57.217 --> 11:58.950
now we're just trying
to find the specific

11:58.952 --> 12:00.418
Internet Wi-Fi node used.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.820
Could give clues
to who did this.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.488
Sylvester:
<i> Shouldn't take too long.</i>

12:03.490 --> 12:05.356
<i> I am connected to the</i>
<i> anc Wi-Fi now,</i>

12:05.358 --> 12:07.358
and I am scanning
every inch of the floor.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.960
Don't worry, we'll find it.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.431
Try not to act too excited.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.502
Sylvester won't be happy.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.838
That statue is limited edition.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.506
Sylvester never got
benched by the president.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.458
It sucks.

12:23.459 --> 12:25.409
Now, we have to carefully
solder the diodes if

12:25.412 --> 12:27.445
we're going to perfectly match
the frequency of the comms.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.447
Quiet, here he comes.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.517
What's all this?

12:32.519 --> 12:35.754
You took his tablet,
so he can't edit

12:35.756 --> 12:37.388
his civics project.
So, we turned to

12:37.390 --> 12:38.990
science, unless a...

12:38.992 --> 12:41.092
Homemade radio is a threat.

12:44.331 --> 12:45.330
He bought it.

12:45.332 --> 12:46.331
This is fun.

12:46.333 --> 12:49.134
We're just getting started.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.035
Found it! The node that
the voting software

12:51.037 --> 12:53.204
was downloaded from is along

12:53.206 --> 12:55.974
the west wall of your floor.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.942
I don't see anything here,
but set dec and talking heads.

12:57.944 --> 12:58.943
There.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.078
It appears it was

13:00.080 --> 13:01.246
downloaded by the node

13:01.248 --> 13:02.947
at 7:13 this morning.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.917
That means zilch if we
don't know who's downloading it.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.185
Well, we're in a room
full of cameras

13:07.187 --> 13:09.053
that are almost always
recording.

13:09.055 --> 13:11.089
We find footage of this area
at 7:13, we got our perp.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.094
Cabe: Pardon me.
Ms. Hampton?

13:17.030 --> 13:18.429
We're gonna need to see

13:18.431 --> 13:19.531
some film from earlier today.

13:19.533 --> 13:20.865
Excuse me?

13:20.867 --> 13:21.900
It could help with
our investigation.

13:21.902 --> 13:22.901
I'm sure it could.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.169
But we're a news organization

13:24.171 --> 13:25.937
that takes the first amendment
quite seriously.

13:25.939 --> 13:27.405
We don't hand over notes,

13:27.407 --> 13:28.540
sources or even b-roll

13:28.542 --> 13:30.175
to anyone without a subpoena.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.844
Corporate policy, handed
down from the 12th floor suits.

13:32.846 --> 13:33.978
You don't understand.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.247
We have a situation...
That you can't win

13:36.249 --> 13:37.515
without a court order.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.184
So, if you please,

13:39.186 --> 13:40.418
the president just did our
morning show

13:40.420 --> 13:42.053
and I'll be working long after

13:42.055 --> 13:43.588
the electoral college
has gone to bed.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.957
So there's no time to be polite
or political.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.392
I can't help you.

13:50.463 --> 13:52.964
That's it?
We're gonna let some

13:52.966 --> 13:54.432
snob with expensive shoes
tell us we're done?

13:54.434 --> 13:55.466
The presidency's on the line.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.035
Happy: Maybe we should
find backheim,

13:57.037 --> 13:58.336
see if he's got a judge who can

13:58.338 --> 14:00.388
hook us up with a subpoena.

14:00.389 --> 14:02.439
Hold on. Paige's shoe
comment got me thinking.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.142
Look at miss thing's footwear.

14:06.313 --> 14:09.447
Band-aid on the achilles' heel
means shoes aren't broken in.

14:10.617 --> 14:13.852
Late 20s means about six years
on the work force.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.587
It's prime time for a promotion.

14:15.589 --> 14:19.224
Those are new shoes for a
new position at anc. Ooh--

14:19.226 --> 14:21.293
you add four anxiety markers,

14:21.294 --> 14:23.361
we got a Doe-eyed greenhorn
that's ripe for manipulation.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.597
Sly, hack anc's
personnel records.

14:25.599 --> 14:27.398
I want that young lady's name
and number.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.235
Cabe, swipe the fork
from that cameraman's take-out.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.236
Paige:
What's your plan?

14:31.238 --> 14:32.370
Well, we need to see film.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.404
The only way they

14:33.406 --> 14:34.505
open up their archives is if

14:34.507 --> 14:36.241
they're desperate to put
something on air

14:36.242 --> 14:37.976
other than the ranting nutbar
that's ruining their show.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.611
Let me guess.
You're the nutbar?

14:43.083 --> 14:45.149
(Cabe exhales)

14:58.465 --> 15:00.131
Okay, we're filming in five!

15:00.133 --> 15:01.432
Let's get the guests up here!
(Phone ringing)

15:01.434 --> 15:03.501
Hello?

15:03.502 --> 15:05.569
Hi. Uh, this is sue dwyer,
i work for Mr. Titus Kincaid.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.906
I-i hate to do this, but, um,

15:07.908 --> 15:08.790
he's gonna miss filming today.

15:08.791 --> 15:09.673
What? He's here.
He's on in minutes!

15:09.676 --> 15:10.959
Yeah, well, he had to leave

15:10.960 --> 15:12.243
family emergency,
but good news is

15:12.245 --> 15:16.648
I have... Dr. Tobias Curtis
from Harvard available.

15:16.650 --> 15:18.416
(Stammering): Who?
He's a...

15:18.418 --> 15:20.084
World famous behaviorist.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.085
Serious?
They never heard of me?

15:21.087 --> 15:22.086
(Whispers):
Stop it!

15:22.088 --> 15:23.087
Sylvester:
Great job, Paige.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.088
I've picked up her phone signal

15:24.090 --> 15:25.189
and spoofed it.

15:25.191 --> 15:27.558
So all calls will
come to me now.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.993
Speaking of which...
(Phone ringing)

15:28.995 --> 15:31.229
(In British accent):
Hello?

15:31.231 --> 15:32.330
Anc...

15:32.332 --> 15:33.698
Hello, this is Titus Kincaid.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.566
I'm supposed to be on now,
but my door is stuck.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.702
Oh, I am terribly sorry
about that.

15:37.704 --> 15:40.305
A maintenance crew will be
sent to you shortly.

15:40.307 --> 15:41.572
Paige:
Dr. Curtis is great.

15:41.574 --> 15:42.941
And, uh, he lives
a few blocks away,

15:42.943 --> 15:43.942
so I sent him over.

15:43.944 --> 15:44.976
You're really killing me, here.

15:44.978 --> 15:45.977
Toby:
Hey!

15:45.979 --> 15:48.013
Dr. Tobias Curtis,

15:48.014 --> 15:50.048
here to dazzle your
television audience.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.985
Okay. Control room.
What now?

15:53.987 --> 15:56.187
We wait for the doc
to do his thing.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.255
(Phone chimes)

16:00.560 --> 16:01.626
Parents just landed?

16:02.462 --> 16:04.245
Do you mind?

16:04.246 --> 16:06.029
Kind of fast for the waitress
to be meeting ma and pa,

16:06.032 --> 16:07.732
don't you think?
Happy, I'm gonna kill you.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.201
(Theme music playing)

16:10.203 --> 16:13.571
We're on in three, two...

16:15.442 --> 16:17.608
Welcome to
<i> the conversation desk.</i>

16:17.610 --> 16:20.078
I'm Terry hines.
On election day,

16:20.080 --> 16:23.047
we have with us,
political strategist monty husk,

16:23.049 --> 16:24.749
columnist grace Gibson

16:24.751 --> 16:28.453
and former Harvard professor,
Dr. Tobias Curtis.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.088
Our first topic:

16:30.090 --> 16:33.091
How will swing state voters
react to last...

16:33.093 --> 16:34.659
(Blows raspberry)
Boring!

16:35.628 --> 16:37.261
See? This is the problem.

16:37.263 --> 16:39.030
Media just shovels sound bite

16:39.032 --> 16:40.331
after sound bite at us,

16:40.333 --> 16:41.432
while no one wants to talk about

16:41.434 --> 16:42.567
the real game that's
being played!

16:42.569 --> 16:43.568
Terry hines:
Okay,

16:43.570 --> 16:44.469
what game is that?

16:44.471 --> 16:45.703
The two party system!

16:45.705 --> 16:47.605
I haven't seen a system
this burnt-out

16:47.607 --> 16:50.575
since my digestive system
on taco night!

16:50.577 --> 16:52.477
I am calling for a return

16:52.479 --> 16:54.545
to European parliamentary
procedure.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.014
40 parties,

16:56.016 --> 16:58.282
no consensus,
just warring factions

16:58.284 --> 17:01.285
forced to work together
to create ruling sects!

17:01.287 --> 17:02.053
What, like Italy?

17:02.055 --> 17:03.121
Wow.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.223
He is really
pissing this host off.

17:05.225 --> 17:06.391
He's got a gift.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.226
They had an adult film star
in parliament.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.528
Yeah, that's 'cause my
<i> paisans</i> know how to party!

17:10.530 --> 17:12.163
And how to say to their reps,

17:12.165 --> 17:15.133
"you do a good job or
we'll replace you with anyone!"

17:15.135 --> 17:16.134
Monty knows

17:16.136 --> 17:17.435
what I'm talking about.

17:17.437 --> 17:18.536
Shut up, monty.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.537
Okay, he's been
obnoxious enough.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.538
Let's do it.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.606
(Door opens)

17:23.410 --> 17:25.143
Hi.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.377
(Clears throat)
Hey.

17:26.379 --> 17:27.478
Hey. Whoa, whoa,

17:27.480 --> 17:28.479
who are you guys?

17:28.481 --> 17:29.814
You can't go into archives.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.582
I'm the new head of
standards and practices

17:31.584 --> 17:34.052
at this network-- I will go
anywhere I damn well please.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.420
Hampton didn't tell you
about me?

17:35.422 --> 17:36.454
Yeah, well,

17:36.456 --> 17:37.989
the suits on the 12th floor

17:37.990 --> 17:39.523
are freaking out
about this Curtis lunatic.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.176
They want us to pull tape

17:41.177 --> 17:42.827
in case we need to cut bait
and fill the airtime.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.295
Unless you want to
tell the 12th floor

17:44.297 --> 17:45.296
that you told me no?

17:45.298 --> 17:46.697
No, no, take what you need.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.366
Good.

17:49.335 --> 17:50.435
Okay, we're ready.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.236
I'm gonna put the earpiece in.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.639
I can hear them,
but they can't hear me.

17:54.641 --> 17:57.241
So... searching for
our comm's frequency.

17:57.243 --> 17:58.342
Ooh, got it.

17:59.579 --> 18:03.147
Happy's talking about
time codes on film and...

18:04.084 --> 18:06.517
Toby...

18:06.519 --> 18:09.654
Toby's yelling about
presidential pardons?

18:09.656 --> 18:11.489
Maybe it has to do with that?

18:13.827 --> 18:17.128
...the king gets to undo it all
with a wave of his hand.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.796
Utter nonsense!

18:18.798 --> 18:19.797
Oh, boy.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.233
Isn't that your friend?

18:22.235 --> 18:25.169
Ye...
I'm gonna find out
what's going on.

18:25.171 --> 18:27.438
Uh, please. Things have
clearly gone haywire

18:27.440 --> 18:28.473
for my team because
I'm not there.

18:28.475 --> 18:29.407
You have to let me leave.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.375
Stay there and sit down.

18:31.377 --> 18:32.677
Come on.
Now!

18:32.679 --> 18:34.345
All right.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.814
Toby: Ah, let me just stop you
right there, Terry.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.516
(Toby speaking indistinctly)

18:38.518 --> 18:40.651
We got to get out of here.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.490
Ralph, pass me that milkshake.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.898
(Toby continues shouting)

18:53.900 --> 18:55.766
If you find out what's going on,
it's my right to know--

18:55.768 --> 18:56.801
oh!
Oh!

18:56.803 --> 18:59.403
Holy...

18:59.405 --> 19:00.605
Are you kidding me?

19:00.607 --> 19:01.739
Sorry.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.209
(Inhales sharply)

19:06.412 --> 19:08.179
Ralph, is he taking it off?

19:08.181 --> 19:09.247
Yes.

19:11.885 --> 19:12.884
Perfect.

19:12.886 --> 19:15.620
Found it! 7:13 A.M.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.388
They were running camera tests

19:17.390 --> 19:18.756
right before their
morning show.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.525
Tim:
Well, that's a problem.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.260
Blow up that image.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.895
Happy:
That woman's working a tablet

19:23.897 --> 19:25.530
by the node.

19:25.532 --> 19:26.631
She must be activating
the bug software

19:26.633 --> 19:28.583
that's messing
with the penter server!

19:28.584 --> 19:30.534
Penter server? Something's
messing with the election.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.170
Tim:
Well, things just got a lot more

19:32.172 --> 19:35.273
complicated, because that woman
is Sophia vasquez...

19:35.275 --> 19:36.774
It's the president's
chief of staff.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.618
All right, happy, you're certain
you stopped the footage

19:47.620 --> 19:49.220
at exactly 7:13?

19:49.222 --> 19:50.955
I know what seven, one and three
look like.

19:50.957 --> 19:52.523
Okay, if the president's
chief of staff

19:52.525 --> 19:54.592
downloaded that bug, and
the president sent the FBI

19:54.594 --> 19:56.294
to get us to fix the server...

19:56.296 --> 19:57.762
How do we know backside,
fart and go-smell-me

19:57.764 --> 19:58.963
aren't in on this?
We don't.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.798
One of 'em, or all of 'em,
can be involved.

20:00.799 --> 20:02.632
Or they could just think that
their job was to get us here

20:02.635 --> 20:03.634
to fix the server.

20:03.636 --> 20:04.802
A server the chief of staff

20:04.804 --> 20:06.270
couldn't have breaking down

20:06.272 --> 20:07.505
when she's trying to
doctor the ballot box.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.373
She didn't anticipate us

20:09.375 --> 20:10.942
stumbling onto her plan.
And

20:10.944 --> 20:12.710
if any of these feds are
actually involved,

20:12.712 --> 20:15.546
they would let us snoop around
until we get too close.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.915
And if we do, we wind up where
the feds left Jimmy hoffa.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.168
And Ralph's
with one of them now.

20:20.169 --> 20:22.420
(Whispers): We have a situation.
Where's your microphone?

20:22.422 --> 20:23.588
Happy: We have to get to the
chief of staff's tablet.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.256
That's the origin of the bug.

20:25.258 --> 20:26.457
We get that, we can stop it.

20:26.459 --> 20:28.659
All right, sly,
we're on our way to get you.

20:28.661 --> 20:29.694
Just stay cool
and don't let govelli

20:29.696 --> 20:31.495
know that we're on to 'em.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.567
I've been updating Washington.
Were you able to find any film?

20:36.569 --> 20:38.302
No.

20:38.304 --> 20:40.471
But, uh, the station manager

20:40.473 --> 20:41.672
said they would
give you the film

20:41.674 --> 20:42.673
with no warrant.

20:42.675 --> 20:43.975
They're up in the control room.

20:43.977 --> 20:45.443
They'll only talk to the FBI.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.345
Okay. Wait here.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.613
Okay.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.450
Let's go.

20:52.452 --> 20:55.353
So, agent govelli,

20:55.355 --> 20:57.555
what is your first name?

20:57.557 --> 21:00.591
It can't be "agent."

21:00.593 --> 21:03.995
Okay, how about
i call you "al"?

21:03.997 --> 21:06.964
You know that song,
"you can call me al"?

21:06.966 --> 21:07.965
Agent backheim (Over phone):
Agent govelli, be advised

21:07.967 --> 21:08.966
that scorpion is no longer

21:08.968 --> 21:10.301
on the eighth floor.

21:10.303 --> 21:11.469
Advise if you see them.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.271
Oh, I don't know
where they are.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.672
Buddy.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.540
Backheim: Govelli?
They're right behind you.

21:16.542 --> 21:18.042
Govelli?

21:23.816 --> 21:25.616
(Tires screech)

21:26.719 --> 21:28.252
Hart, be advised

21:28.253 --> 21:29.786
scorpion has assaulted an agent
and stolen his vehicle.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.556
They are on the run.
I repeat, they are on the run.

21:35.028 --> 21:36.427
Walter:
Funny, Ralph.

21:36.429 --> 21:37.762
(Ralph chuckles)
Very funny.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.463
Walter:
Amusing.

21:42.335 --> 21:45.036
Hey, o'brien, get out here.
Your team's up to something.

21:45.038 --> 21:47.638
Walter: I can't.
Doing a science experiment.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.775
Ralph:
Sorry, agent fart, we're busy.

21:50.777 --> 21:53.311
Ralph: Sorry for
what's about to happen.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.850
Ralph, grab his sport coat.
I'll grab the tablet.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.592
(Tires screeching)

22:11.531 --> 22:14.965
His keys, your cell,
your comms.

22:14.967 --> 22:16.934
(Chuckles) We're back
in the game, Ralph.

22:16.936 --> 22:19.837
Guys, we made it out.
Ralph, are you okay?

22:19.839 --> 22:21.689
Oh, he's fine.
We're having fun.

22:21.690 --> 22:23.540
Now, we've been listening
over your comms,

22:23.543 --> 22:25.059
and we're up to speed--
you're right.

22:25.060 --> 22:26.576
You need to get
the chief of staff's tablet.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.363
According to the president's
public schedule,

22:29.364 --> 22:31.047
there's a 20-minute window
where we can cross with him

22:31.050 --> 22:32.516
at Westchester.

22:32.518 --> 22:33.951
We'll never make it in time.
Ralph and I will.

22:33.953 --> 22:35.686
No!
Oh, your mom's upset.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.555
We'll be okay, mom.
Toby: Hopefully.

22:37.557 --> 22:38.689
You're going to lax.

22:38.691 --> 22:39.990
You're gonna have to
get the tablet

22:39.992 --> 22:41.659
off of air force one.

22:41.661 --> 22:42.827
Cabe: If you don't
protect the president,

22:42.829 --> 22:43.828
report to the president,

22:43.830 --> 22:45.563
or feed the president,

22:45.565 --> 22:46.797
you don't get on that plane.

22:46.799 --> 22:48.699
What to you mean,
"feed the president"?

22:48.701 --> 22:50.701
When potus travels,

22:50.702 --> 22:52.702
they pre-clear any
restaurant or food service

22:52.705 --> 22:53.904
he requests-- why?

22:55.575 --> 22:57.575
Call homeland, tell them
you have a security issue

22:57.577 --> 22:59.610
you want to check out with
whoever's providing the food

22:59.612 --> 23:00.845
at air force one today.

23:00.847 --> 23:02.980
And then get me
the name of the caterer.

23:02.982 --> 23:05.116
On it.
We'll go to the server
to hardwire

23:05.118 --> 23:06.684
a firewall, so no one
can restart the bug

23:06.686 --> 23:07.818
once you shut it off.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.019
How do plan on
getting near

23:09.021 --> 23:10.888
air force one, Wally?
Walter: Easy.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.824
We just need to stop at a kinkos
and a convenience store.

23:24.804 --> 23:27.605
Yeah, this looks
pretty good.

23:27.607 --> 23:29.073
We'll get right onto
the tarmac.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.675
"We"?
Of course.

23:31.677 --> 23:33.010
It's bring your son
to work day.

23:36.149 --> 23:37.882
You know what
to do, right?

23:37.884 --> 23:39.683
And be careful.

23:39.685 --> 23:41.552
Good luck.

23:43.122 --> 23:46.757
Excuse me.
Agent hart, FBI.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.793
I'm gonna be making your
delivery to air force one today.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.127
I don't get it.
I've already been

23:50.129 --> 23:51.662
pre-screened
by secret service.

23:51.664 --> 23:52.797
I'm sure you're
disappointed.

23:52.799 --> 23:53.931
Everyone likes
to see the plane.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.666
But added security,
what with it being

23:55.668 --> 23:57.134
election day and all,
only level-five clearance

23:57.136 --> 23:58.869
allowed on the tarmac.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.805
I'll return your truck
within the hour.

24:03.643 --> 24:06.110
Okay.
Thank you.

24:12.752 --> 24:14.919
We've got pies back here.

24:14.921 --> 24:18.456
Now what? Happy can't pick
this 50-digit code monster

24:18.458 --> 24:19.824
like the other locks.

24:19.825 --> 24:21.191
I was watching backheim
when he entered it.

24:21.194 --> 24:24.829
I have it memorized.
Let me do my thing.

24:24.831 --> 24:28.532
Hey, um, I'm sorry
about earlier.

24:28.534 --> 24:30.534
These guys seep
into ever corner

24:30.536 --> 24:33.237
of my personal life
like black mold.

24:33.239 --> 24:34.538
Don't worry about it.

24:34.540 --> 24:35.973
Look, I get it.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.775
I grew up with four sisters.

24:37.776 --> 24:39.576
Every girl I ever dated was
subjected to an inquisition.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.812
So you're saying
scorpion is acting

24:41.814 --> 24:43.113
like a teenage girl?

24:43.115 --> 24:44.548
Well...

24:44.550 --> 24:46.083
No.

24:46.085 --> 24:47.518
I think they care about you.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.019
Look, let's just
enjoy ourselves tonight.

24:49.021 --> 24:51.055
It's only a dance.

24:51.057 --> 24:52.990
Right.
But statistically...

24:52.992 --> 24:54.992
(Keypad trills)
I'm in.

24:54.994 --> 24:58.496
Sometimes I hate this job.
(Door creaks open)

25:02.702 --> 25:04.134
How long will it take
the soda to eat through

25:04.136 --> 25:05.703
this fruity roll?

25:05.705 --> 25:07.805
Well, it's essentially
made up of pectin,

25:07.807 --> 25:09.540
a water-soluble
polysaccharide

25:09.542 --> 25:11.108
that the carbonation
will get through quickly,

25:11.110 --> 25:12.643
say around three minutes.

25:12.645 --> 25:13.978
Okay, so once you're
done with that,

25:13.980 --> 25:16.213
take my photo
off hart's badge

25:16.215 --> 25:17.715
and then put it
on the caterer's ID.

25:17.717 --> 25:18.716
It's on the console.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.518
Copy that.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.119
Hey, Walt.

25:22.121 --> 25:24.855
Mm-hmm?
Today's been great.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.591
It hasn't been
half bad, has it?

25:36.168 --> 25:37.635
Hey, how are you?

25:37.637 --> 25:38.969
Best food in the southland.

25:38.971 --> 25:40.871
Okay.

25:46.579 --> 25:50.147
I can't believe
I'm this close to air force one.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.553
Hold up.

25:55.555 --> 25:56.921
How you doing?

26:02.628 --> 26:05.296
Got the best food
in the southland

26:05.298 --> 26:06.730
for the commander in chief.

26:43.603 --> 26:45.903
(Indistinct chatter)

26:46.939 --> 26:49.006
(Hissing)

26:52.144 --> 26:53.677
(Loud bang)

26:53.679 --> 26:54.945
(Alarmed chatter)

26:54.947 --> 26:56.313
Breach on angel!
Evacuate angel!

26:56.315 --> 26:58.849
(All clamoring)

27:22.174 --> 27:23.907
Uh-huh.

27:23.909 --> 27:26.043
Found it.

27:26.045 --> 27:27.911
Chief of staff's tablet.
Finishing up the firewalls

27:27.913 --> 27:30.247
now to prevent
another bug download.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.383
But it's meaningless
if you don't stop the tablet

27:32.385 --> 27:34.302
from running
that program, Walt.

27:34.303 --> 27:36.220
I'm into the software
and I'm shutting it down.

27:36.222 --> 27:37.321
Hurry up, son.
It's only a matter of time

27:37.323 --> 27:39.256
before they find you.

27:39.258 --> 27:41.859
Guys, there's something weird
about the votes on this server.

27:41.861 --> 27:43.193
Yeah? They've been
screwed with.

27:43.195 --> 27:44.995
But not how
we anticipated.

27:44.997 --> 27:47.131
This says that
75% of the votes

27:47.133 --> 27:49.266
have been tallied,
but only

27:49.268 --> 27:51.435
8.1 million votes
have been recorded.

27:51.437 --> 27:53.270
Based on historical
voter turnout,

27:53.272 --> 27:55.773
82 million votes
should have come in by now.

27:55.775 --> 27:57.975
Which means 90%
of the votes are missing.

27:57.977 --> 27:59.160
It's an under-vote.

27:59.161 --> 28:00.344
Why would the chief of staff
want to erase votes?

28:00.346 --> 28:01.445
Walter:
She doesn't.

28:01.447 --> 28:03.280
No, I know who's behind this.

28:03.282 --> 28:05.015
It's not the white house.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.718
Man (Cocking gun):
Freeze! Hands up, now!

28:17.263 --> 28:18.796
I know this looks bad.

28:22.268 --> 28:23.767
Or really bad.

28:23.769 --> 28:26.070
Mr. o'brien, you are
under arrest.

28:26.072 --> 28:27.871
Listen to me,
i know how the election

28:27.873 --> 28:28.872
is being manipulated.

28:28.874 --> 28:30.074
Yeah, by you
and your friends.

28:30.076 --> 28:31.341
You somehow remotely
slowed the server

28:31.343 --> 28:33.277
to get us to give you
access to it.

28:33.279 --> 28:34.411
Then you messed
with the votes.

28:34.413 --> 28:37.014
No. No, no!

28:37.016 --> 28:39.750
The bug was downloaded
remotely by Chinese hackers.

28:39.752 --> 28:41.285
I saw Beijing coding
signatures

28:41.287 --> 28:42.703
buried deep
within the virus.

28:42.704 --> 28:44.120
Now, the real question is
why are the Chinese

28:44.123 --> 28:45.255
trying to create
an under-vote

28:45.257 --> 28:47.091
without swaying
the election either way?

28:47.093 --> 28:49.326
Vasquez:
I have an idea why.

28:52.298 --> 28:53.897
Chief of staff vasquez.

28:53.899 --> 28:54.998
The world court is about
to make a decision

28:55.000 --> 28:56.366
about a new arctic
shipping route.

28:56.368 --> 28:58.802
Due to rising temperatures,
ice-breaking vessels

28:58.804 --> 29:01.505
will soon be able to traverse
directly over the north pole.

29:01.507 --> 29:05.008
The route of the north pole
is 20% shorter

29:05.010 --> 29:06.977
than the standard
northern sea route.

29:06.979 --> 29:08.445
The economic invocations
are immense.

29:08.447 --> 29:10.347
And China knows
the court will never

29:10.349 --> 29:11.749
give control of those routes

29:11.751 --> 29:13.884
to a country
with no clear leader.

29:13.886 --> 29:15.753
So if in a few hours,
only 10% of the public's vote

29:15.755 --> 29:17.321
are actually in the ballot box,

29:17.323 --> 29:18.372
there's gonna be
finger pointing,

29:18.373 --> 29:19.422
conspiracy theories,
absolute chaos.

29:19.425 --> 29:21.358
We'll be without a president.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.827
It's sun tzu 101:
"All warfare is deception.

29:23.829 --> 29:25.329
In the middle of chaos
there is opportunity."

29:25.331 --> 29:26.830
So just delete
the virus from my tablet

29:26.832 --> 29:28.432
and return the votes.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.033
The Chinese just ghosted it
onto your tablet

29:30.035 --> 29:31.802
to implicate
your administration.

29:31.804 --> 29:33.370
It's actually being run
from one of their computers.

29:33.372 --> 29:36.874
Well, last I checked,
China's pretty far away.

29:36.876 --> 29:39.343
Now, how do we stop this
before the public realizes

29:39.345 --> 29:40.944
their votes have been vaporized?

29:40.946 --> 29:42.079
Walter:
Based on latency

29:42.081 --> 29:44.214
and their real-time control...

29:44.216 --> 29:45.215
They're here in L.A.

29:45.217 --> 29:47.050
I can track them down digitally.

29:47.052 --> 29:49.920
I'll need help from my partner.

29:49.922 --> 29:52.122
He's hiding
in the catering truck.

30:07.039 --> 30:08.939
Can you believe
the stones on these guys?

30:08.941 --> 30:11.141
Pulling the hack from
the consulate we gave 'em.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.242
Yeah, they're smart.

30:12.244 --> 30:13.811
It's technically
Chinese soil.

30:13.813 --> 30:15.012
Limits their exposure.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.013
If we want to stop
the bug from running,

30:16.015 --> 30:17.531
it'll take too long
to hack it.

30:17.532 --> 30:19.048
I need to get my hands
on the exact device running it.

30:21.287 --> 30:24.087
Cabe, adjust your phone.
I need a clear visual.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.091
Quiet, here they come.

30:28.093 --> 30:31.562
Gentlemen, welcome
to our consulate.

30:31.564 --> 30:33.397
I'm pleased the president
would like to resume talks

30:33.399 --> 30:35.299
regarding the arctic canal,

30:35.301 --> 30:37.935
but surprised he wants
to do it on election day.

30:37.937 --> 30:40.170
Potus never stops working.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.139
Perhaps a nice
news story to promote

30:42.141 --> 30:43.941
while people are
still going to the polls.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.409
Every vote counts.

30:45.411 --> 30:47.211
Backheim: Potus motorcade
is 15 minutes out.

30:47.213 --> 30:48.912
Best begin our
advance-team security sweep.

30:48.914 --> 30:49.913
Of course.

30:49.915 --> 30:52.049
Follow me.
12 minutes

30:52.051 --> 30:53.283
till polls close
in eastern Kentucky

30:53.285 --> 30:54.551
and the results
start coming in.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.453
More like lack of results.

30:56.455 --> 30:58.522
Guys, shake your
hanging chads and move it.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.908
Walter, once you stop
the bug from running,

31:00.909 --> 31:03.293
I will verify that the votes are
coming back into this server.

31:03.295 --> 31:04.428
Hopefully.

31:04.430 --> 31:06.563
My own security is
stationed in the front

31:06.565 --> 31:08.131
and the back of the home.

31:08.133 --> 31:12.002
I assure you it is a safe
facility for your president.

31:12.004 --> 31:13.320
And this is the room

31:13.321 --> 31:14.637
where we will
actually be meeting.

31:14.640 --> 31:15.939
Please...

31:15.941 --> 31:17.941
Ah, right there!

31:17.943 --> 31:19.643
The ambassador leaned to the
right when he passed that door,

31:19.645 --> 31:21.256
and he put his hand
on Walt's back,

31:21.257 --> 31:22.868
like he was trying
to guide you away from it.

31:22.869 --> 31:24.480
Toby:
You got to get in that room!

31:24.483 --> 31:25.515
Is everything satisfactory?

31:25.517 --> 31:27.351
So far, yes,
but I would like

31:27.353 --> 31:28.585
to inspect the east wing.

31:28.587 --> 31:31.188
Agents hart, govelli,
backheim, you're with me.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.189
You two stay here.

31:32.191 --> 31:35.092
Secure the entrance.
Yes, sir.

31:36.095 --> 31:37.995
This way.
Mm-hmm.

32:01.186 --> 32:03.353
(Whispering):
That tea is warm.

32:03.355 --> 32:06.556
Whoever was just here
could be back any minute.

32:06.558 --> 32:08.225
This is the laptop.

32:08.227 --> 32:10.360
Just found the bug software.
Just have to...

32:10.362 --> 32:12.396
(Toilet flushes nearby)

32:17.169 --> 32:18.969
Oh, poop.
Well, obviously.

32:18.971 --> 32:20.037
He's tucking his shirt in.

32:20.039 --> 32:21.605
(Speaking in Chinese)

32:21.607 --> 32:23.974
Run!

32:23.976 --> 32:25.153
(Grunting)

32:25.154 --> 32:26.331
Happy:
Three minutes until polls close

32:26.332 --> 32:27.509
in eastern Kentucky.
Sylvester: Walter, you need

32:27.513 --> 32:29.112
to a find a place
to finish shutting down

32:29.114 --> 32:30.614
the software.

32:33.052 --> 32:34.952
(Shouts)
Go!

32:34.954 --> 32:36.320
Now!

32:37.389 --> 32:39.356
♪ ♪

32:42.094 --> 32:44.161
(Indistinct shouting)

32:51.103 --> 32:52.269
Toby:
Okay.

32:52.271 --> 32:54.204
It's time for you
to embrace technology.

32:54.206 --> 32:55.472
Ralph: You just got to connect
to the Van's Wi-Fi.

32:55.474 --> 32:56.740
We'll take it from there.

32:56.742 --> 32:58.575
This is a foreign
language to me.

32:58.577 --> 33:00.143
It's just typing in a password.

33:00.145 --> 33:01.144
Cabe:
No...

33:01.146 --> 33:03.213
It's literally foreign.

33:03.215 --> 33:04.314
It's in Chinese.

33:09.054 --> 33:11.588
All right, gallo,
I'm pulling up a chinese/english

33:11.590 --> 33:13.457
keyboard overlay and we will
walk you through this.

33:13.459 --> 33:17.160
Give me the damn password!
It's "geniusbobenius."

33:17.162 --> 33:19.162
I can't even spell
that in English!

33:19.164 --> 33:20.764
It's 14 keys, like a crossword.

33:20.766 --> 33:23.400
Four down, six across. That's g.

33:23.402 --> 33:27.037
Three down, four across.
That's e.

33:27.039 --> 33:29.039
That's a good call
with the crossword analogy.

33:29.041 --> 33:30.374
The elderly love their puzzles.

33:30.376 --> 33:33.310
(Shouting outside continues)

33:33.312 --> 33:35.345
One minute until
the Kentucky results come in.

33:37.149 --> 33:38.432
Happy:
Okay, I'm in.

33:38.433 --> 33:39.716
Good job, cabe,
we'll take it from here.

33:39.718 --> 33:41.251
Sylvester:
The server is speeding up!

33:41.253 --> 33:42.319
The voting data's being sent
back to the penter server.

33:42.321 --> 33:44.521
It's all the missing votes.

33:44.523 --> 33:45.756
(Shouting, pounding on the door)

33:45.758 --> 33:47.758
(Shouting in Chinese)

33:47.760 --> 33:49.459
Guys, they're at the door!

33:49.461 --> 33:51.361
Oh, you can't let them
get the laptop.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.063
It'll take another 20 seconds

33:53.065 --> 33:55.599
for all votes
to get back to the server!

33:58.737 --> 33:59.803
Aah!

34:01.707 --> 34:03.306
(Shouts, grunts)

34:03.308 --> 34:05.242
Ugh!
Toby: Cabe,

34:05.244 --> 34:06.410
I'll meet you at the fence!

34:06.412 --> 34:08.078
Still downloading!

34:08.080 --> 34:09.813
(Dog barking in distance)

34:13.819 --> 34:15.285
(Shouting in Chinese)

34:15.287 --> 34:17.187
(Gunshot)
Whoa...

34:17.189 --> 34:18.422
(Speaking in Chinese)

34:18.424 --> 34:22.159
Download complete!
We got the votes!

34:22.161 --> 34:23.393
Yeah, but they got cabe.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.662
And Walt and Tim
and fart and backside.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.697
Hands up!
Drop the laptop.

34:31.804 --> 34:33.236
Turn around slowly.

34:33.238 --> 34:34.371
Toby:
It's too late!

34:34.373 --> 34:35.873
This metal box is on U.S. soil,

34:35.874 --> 34:37.374
and it's overflowing with
evidence incriminating you.

34:37.376 --> 34:39.242
So, let our pals go,

34:39.244 --> 34:40.477
I toss this puppy over,
and we all go back

34:40.479 --> 34:43.647
to hacking and spying
on each other forever.

34:43.649 --> 34:46.416
Or I could take this
to the world court.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.285
If history's any indication,
your country

34:48.287 --> 34:51.755
will throw you under the bus
in a heartbeat to save face.

34:51.757 --> 34:54.424
How are the accommodations
in Chinese prison-- nice?

34:54.426 --> 34:55.492
Ambassador:
Or...

34:55.494 --> 34:57.794
I have my guards
shoot all of you,

34:57.796 --> 34:59.663
I take the laptop,

34:59.665 --> 35:01.665
and say you tried
to attack the consulate.

35:01.667 --> 35:02.799
Cabe:
Only problem,

35:02.801 --> 35:04.868
I got something taping
you in my pocket.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.303
It's not taping, it's
digital. How many times

35:06.305 --> 35:07.637
I got to tell you this?
Whatever.

35:07.639 --> 35:09.573
Point is, everything you said
is being recorded

35:09.575 --> 35:11.141
and sent to my
homeland account.

35:11.143 --> 35:12.375
If I'm shot dead,

35:12.377 --> 35:14.411
they'll find this mp3.

35:14.413 --> 35:16.446
Mp3s are audio.
You're recording video...

35:16.448 --> 35:18.381
I swear, doc,
my foot and your ass

35:18.383 --> 35:21.318
are going on a date real soon.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.220
Just take the deal.

35:33.732 --> 35:36.266
I'd love to stay,
but I got to go vote.

35:36.268 --> 35:39.236
♪ ♪

35:41.140 --> 35:42.139
Cabe:
<i> Yes, sir.</i>

35:42.141 --> 35:43.607
Appreciate that, sir.

35:43.609 --> 35:46.376
I will pass that along, sir.

35:46.378 --> 35:49.880
Well, the president wants me
to extend his personal gratitude

35:49.882 --> 35:51.214
for scorpion's efforts.

35:51.216 --> 35:52.916
He said he's gonna send
over a surprise.

35:52.918 --> 35:55.685
What is it?
Is "surprise"
a complicated word?

35:55.687 --> 35:57.587
(Door opens)
I'm looking for Sylvester,

35:57.589 --> 35:59.973
the conquestor
of the enchanted valley?

35:59.974 --> 36:02.358
There's a situation concerning
the knights of west altadenia.

36:02.361 --> 36:03.460
Who are the hell are you?

36:03.462 --> 36:05.495
Kaldor the prestidigitator,
nephew

36:05.497 --> 36:07.164
of Otto the brave.

36:07.166 --> 36:08.732
I'm in no mood, kid.

36:08.734 --> 36:10.634
Glenn applemen.
Sylvester: Kaldor!

36:10.636 --> 36:12.302
Have the knights assembled?

36:13.272 --> 36:15.305
This country is screwed.

36:15.307 --> 36:16.840
No, but I just learned

36:16.842 --> 36:18.475
that councilman patel's
flipping his vote.

36:18.477 --> 36:20.911
He was our only chance
at saving the warlock's chest!

36:20.913 --> 36:22.479
(Horns trill)
Oh, man.

36:22.481 --> 36:23.480
That's my mom.

36:23.482 --> 36:24.915
I got to go.
Sloppy Joe night.

36:24.917 --> 36:27.617
Okay. Stay strong, brother.

36:27.619 --> 36:28.885
We will prevail.

36:31.390 --> 36:33.190
(Door opens, closes)

36:33.192 --> 36:35.325
I have an announcement.

36:35.327 --> 36:36.760
You're still a virgin. We know.

36:36.762 --> 36:39.429
Something else.
I am running for office.

36:39.431 --> 36:40.630
You're what?

36:40.632 --> 36:42.532
Today's case has me thinking.

36:42.534 --> 36:45.335
The right to vote is
our most precious freedom.

36:45.337 --> 36:47.604
Whether the choices are
incredible, ridiculous

36:47.606 --> 36:49.673
or in-between.

36:49.675 --> 36:51.875
So I am running for
the 16th district alderman

36:51.877 --> 36:53.243
of west altadenia

36:53.245 --> 36:54.844
in the local,
upcoming election.

36:54.846 --> 36:57.214
I'm hoping that I can
be incredible,

36:57.216 --> 36:59.916
or at worst, in-between.
(Clears throat)

36:59.918 --> 37:01.418
But by valkyrie's shield,

37:01.420 --> 37:04.521
i-i will save
the warlock's chest.

37:04.523 --> 37:07.524
Thank you.
I hope I can count on your vote.

37:07.526 --> 37:08.959
You got it, pal.

37:11.930 --> 37:14.531
None of us vote
in west altadenia.

37:15.534 --> 37:17.834
You sure about this tie?

37:17.836 --> 37:20.403
Bow ties are superior
in case of emergency.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.505
Neckties carry the risk
of getting caught on things.

37:22.507 --> 37:23.907
(Groans)

37:23.909 --> 37:25.475
You're nervous.

37:25.477 --> 37:27.377
I'm not nervous.

37:27.379 --> 37:30.614
I'm just anxious.

37:30.616 --> 37:32.515
Is it because of the statistics?

37:32.517 --> 37:34.684
Who-who told you that?

37:34.686 --> 37:36.920
There's no secrets
in this place.

37:36.922 --> 37:38.888
You're telling me.
(Chuckles)

37:38.890 --> 37:41.524
Do you like Tim?

37:41.526 --> 37:43.326
Is he nice to you?

37:44.296 --> 37:46.363
Yes and yes.

37:46.365 --> 37:48.465
He's very sweet and kind.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.433
I do like him, yes.

37:50.435 --> 37:52.802
Good, because you do
everything for me,

37:52.804 --> 37:55.572
so I want you to be happy.

37:55.574 --> 37:58.642
And odds are if
you go tonight,

37:58.644 --> 38:00.977
there's a better than not chance
he'll become my stepdad.

38:00.979 --> 38:02.879
And...

38:02.881 --> 38:05.515
If you're happy with him,
so am I.

38:06.752 --> 38:10.854
Ralph, we are very far away
from that.

38:10.856 --> 38:13.823
Stats, mom.
We're not as far as you think.

38:16.395 --> 38:17.394
There.

38:17.396 --> 38:18.862
All done.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.597
And thank you for what you said.

38:20.599 --> 38:22.565
I am not as anxious anymore.

38:28.874 --> 38:30.073
Ooh la la.

38:31.376 --> 38:33.076
(Door opens)

38:33.078 --> 38:34.344
(Clears throat)

38:37.549 --> 38:39.883
(Chuckles softly)

38:39.885 --> 38:41.785
Wow.

38:41.787 --> 38:43.453
You look beautiful.
Well, thank you.

38:43.455 --> 38:45.689
I am excited to meet
your parents, um...

38:45.691 --> 38:48.358
But the Armstrong sisters
seem tough...

38:48.360 --> 38:49.859
They are for another day.

38:49.861 --> 38:50.994
Good.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.729
(Chuckles)
Ralph, you ready?

38:52.731 --> 38:53.730
Be right there.

38:53.732 --> 38:55.398
Okay.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.400
(Mouse clicking)

38:59.338 --> 39:01.205
Don't fill up on bread.

39:01.206 --> 39:03.073
You should have taken my mom
dancing when you had the chance.

39:03.075 --> 39:04.841
(Sniffles)

39:05.811 --> 39:08.345
We could've been partners
forever.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.022
(Door opens)

39:19.024 --> 39:21.057
Toby:
Ms. linehan,

39:21.059 --> 39:22.692
what a pleasant sur...
Can it.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.461
(Door opens)

39:24.463 --> 39:26.830
Mr. o'brien, I know
that you and Ms. Quinn

39:26.832 --> 39:28.798
perpetrated a
fraudulent marriage.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.734
I was not fooled, not once.

39:30.736 --> 39:33.002
And if it were up to me, you
would be deported immediately

39:33.004 --> 39:35.672
and Ms. Quinn would
face prosecution.

39:35.674 --> 39:36.873
But tonight,

39:36.875 --> 39:38.975
I received a call
from Washington, D.C.

39:38.977 --> 39:42.011
And they have enacted a private
bill, granting you citizenship.

39:42.981 --> 39:45.648
Welcome to America.

39:47.018 --> 39:48.084
Thank you.

39:49.554 --> 39:51.421
That was the surprise?

39:51.423 --> 39:53.590
Happy and I can get married!

39:53.592 --> 39:56.826
Proud to call you
an American, son.

39:56.828 --> 39:58.094
Proud to be one.

39:58.096 --> 40:00.630
Toby:
Happy! You're back! Guess what?

40:00.632 --> 40:02.632
Walt's a yankee doodle dandy!
We can get hitched!

40:02.634 --> 40:05.135
Really? That's great.

40:05.137 --> 40:07.404
Come on, let's go
grab some apple pie.

40:07.406 --> 40:08.438
I'm buying.

40:08.440 --> 40:09.506
Sure.

40:17.182 --> 40:18.948
Why are you taking this apart?

40:18.950 --> 40:21.818
I'm not pregnant.

40:27.759 --> 40:30.760
What happened at the doctor?

40:30.762 --> 40:33.897
My blood test
was a false positive

40:33.899 --> 40:36.833
caused by cadmium poisoning.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.904
From working
on those solar panels.

40:43.975 --> 40:46.075
That would explain
your morning sickness

40:46.077 --> 40:47.677
and late menstrual cycle.

40:51.082 --> 40:53.016
It's okay to be upset.

40:53.018 --> 40:54.050
I'm not.

40:54.052 --> 40:57.520
It is okay to be upset, happy.

40:57.522 --> 40:59.155
You know, when I was, uh,

40:59.157 --> 41:01.591
in elementary school,

41:01.593 --> 41:03.126
I was jealous of the other kids.

41:03.128 --> 41:06.596
Because their parents waited
outside to take them home,

41:06.598 --> 41:09.699
and I walked
to the orphanage by myself.

41:12.037 --> 41:14.838
I was looking forward

41:14.840 --> 41:17.207
to waiting outside for somebody.

41:19.044 --> 41:20.944
(Sniffles)

41:27.085 --> 41:28.785
Hey, hey, hey!
Ah-ta-ta-ta...

41:28.787 --> 41:31.120
Hey, come here,
listen to me.

41:32.057 --> 41:33.590
We love each other.

41:35.660 --> 41:37.060
We're gonna have a family.

41:37.062 --> 41:39.496
You're gonna wait
outside a school

41:39.498 --> 41:41.631
and you're gonna build a crib

41:41.633 --> 41:43.500
and you're gonna
share tools with

41:43.502 --> 41:46.736
whatever baby is lucky enough
to have you as their mom.

41:46.738 --> 41:50.006
It'll happen when
the time is right.

41:51.977 --> 41:53.643
It is gonna happen.

42:01.019 --> 42:04.988
I just need to be alone
right now.

42:04.990 --> 42:06.623
Okay.

42:13.598 --> 42:16.132
First, I never
got the answer

42:16.134 --> 42:20.036
that I was looking for
the first time.

42:20.038 --> 42:22.705
And I don't have a song, but
I've carried this ring with me

yes.
