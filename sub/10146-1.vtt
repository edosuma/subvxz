00:53.137 --> 00:54.637
Hey.

00:55.681 --> 00:58.391
- I thought I'd lost you.
- Beer? Cheers.

01:04.982 --> 01:06.899
Where are we going?

01:06.984 --> 01:09.444
Beach parties are okay for tourists.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.487
I want you to see the real Thailand.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.741
You see, that just sounds like
a bad excuse to get me alone.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.660
Yeah, it is.

01:45.481 --> 01:46.564
What's going...

01:46.732 --> 01:49.567
Eddie! No!

01:52.571 --> 01:55.031
When I was young, my father used to tell me

01:55.115 --> 01:58.367
that there were very few differences
that cannot be settled

01:58.452 --> 02:00.870
by a good honest chat across a table.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.581
I look forward to proving him right.

02:04.041 --> 02:07.627
I would like to personally
welcome General Ong Ji-Woo

02:07.836 --> 02:09.961
and the North Korean delegation.

02:10.422 --> 02:13.216
I would like to stress that
their satellite launches

02:13.300 --> 02:16.719
and long-range tests are just that...

02:25.020 --> 02:28.189
I'm so sorry, if you would
just excuse me for a moment.

02:28.273 --> 02:32.401
Malcolm, if you could just
take over for a second, thank you.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.614
I'm terribly sorry,
ladies and gentlemen. In the meantime...

02:39.743 --> 02:41.911
What is it? What's wrong?

02:46.250 --> 02:49.335
I have your daughter.
Any publicity, she's dead.

02:49.419 --> 02:53.923
Any police, she's dead.
You don't do exactly as we say, she's dead.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.258
No!

02:55.342 --> 02:56.968
I'll be in touch.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.721
Daddy! No!

03:01.765 --> 03:04.183
Dad!

04:41.990 --> 04:43.324
All quiet?

04:43.408 --> 04:45.117
Hey, boss.

05:06.431 --> 05:09.976
Bravo One, Bravo Two, are you in position?

05:10.143 --> 05:11.978
Affirmative. In position.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.649
Philip, how can you be sure
the boy is telling us the truth?

05:19.236 --> 05:21.153
I believe the kid.

05:22.406 --> 05:23.739
Don't you?

05:25.450 --> 05:29.745
You did the right thing coming to me, Robin.
We'll get her back.

05:39.923 --> 05:44.510
Zero. Eyes on two targets.
Bravo Three, what's your position?

05:44.594 --> 05:47.013
Coming to you. I'm nearly there.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.308
Bravo Three at rear of building
and in position.

05:52.936 --> 05:56.355
Bravo One, Bravo Two, stand by.
Bravo Three, now.

05:56.440 --> 05:57.606
Copy that.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.891
Shit, we've got to move.
Get the girl, get the girl.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.602
Lock the door, get her out of here.

06:34.728 --> 06:38.647
Come on! Jeez. Come here.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.316
Fire in the hole.

06:48.784 --> 06:50.701
- Ah!
- Move.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.004
Clear!

07:03.840 --> 07:05.132
Clear.

07:06.343 --> 07:07.843
Scott, in here, in here!

07:13.892 --> 07:16.602
Bravo, hostiles exiting rear of building!

07:16.686 --> 07:17.728
Yeah, roger that!

07:21.108 --> 07:22.108
Shit!

07:24.236 --> 07:25.528
Let's go!

07:27.864 --> 07:29.323
- Was that her?
- I don't know.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.283
Come here, come here!

07:31.451 --> 07:33.035
Boss, what do you want us to do?

07:34.079 --> 07:35.996
- Scott, go after that girl.
- Copy that.

07:36.081 --> 07:37.998
Bravo One, check the rest of the building.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.625
Scott! On me. Move!

07:46.133 --> 07:47.299
Fuck!

07:51.555 --> 07:54.140
Zero, you getting this?
I've got a room full of girls here.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.391
Is Chloe there?

07:55.892 --> 07:58.352
No, that's a negative.
Negative, Chloe's not here.

07:59.062 --> 08:01.605
Bravo One, follow Bravo Two.
Go after that girl.

08:01.857 --> 08:03.858
No, bollocks! I'm not leaving them.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.571
Martinez, I need you in here.
I need you to come help.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.197
I'm coming to you.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.877
Go!

08:23.628 --> 08:25.004
Fuck! Get in!

08:27.757 --> 08:29.466
In here! Get the girls!

08:33.346 --> 08:35.597
Fuck! What the hell?

08:39.269 --> 08:41.770
Zero, this is Bravo Two.
I'm in pursuit.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.371
Martinez, move! Get out now!

08:59.456 --> 09:02.124
I'm good, I'm good, I'm nearly there.
Follow her!

09:15.055 --> 09:16.513
Shit!

09:17.974 --> 09:19.725
Get off the bike! I need your bike.

09:22.646 --> 09:26.023
- Bravo One, the girls are clear.
- Roger that.

09:49.464 --> 09:50.464
Stay down!

09:52.884 --> 09:54.468
Move! Get out of the way!

10:09.359 --> 10:10.359
Out of the way!

10:18.618 --> 10:20.369
Fuck! Move!

10:26.459 --> 10:27.543
What the fuck?

10:28.878 --> 10:30.671
Coming to you, Scott. Stand by.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.051
Here you go, asshole.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.772
Is he alive?

10:53.653 --> 10:54.737
Shit!

10:55.822 --> 10:58.365
Bravo One and Two. Send sit rep.

10:58.450 --> 10:59.825
Scott, they knew we were coming.

11:01.911 --> 11:06.415
Zero, hostage is gone.
I repeat, the girl is gone.

11:19.596 --> 11:22.222
Good afternoon, ambassadors, delegates

11:22.307 --> 11:24.767
and ladies and gentlemen of the press.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.269
How the fuck did they know we were coming?

11:27.604 --> 11:29.646
It was supposed to be covert.

11:29.773 --> 11:32.066
What? You think he'd risk
the life of his own daughter?

11:32.150 --> 11:33.650
Only a handful of people
even know we're here.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.904
Foster kept this quiet, I assure you.

11:36.988 --> 11:40.616
Well, not quiet enough. Someone knew.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.826
Mmm. And we lost her because of it.

11:44.371 --> 11:47.748
I've known Robin Foster for 20 years,
Chloe since she was born.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.208
That's why he called me first.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.460
And I promised him that this team
would get her back alive.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.880
So we'd better find a way of fixing this.

11:55.799 --> 11:57.007
Richmond, you got anything?

12:07.310 --> 12:10.354
- He's not on the Thai police system.
- So we've got nothing?

12:10.438 --> 12:11.814
Well, maybe not nothing.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.400
There's a mate of mine here,
he's ex-military intelligence.

12:14.484 --> 12:17.903
He's got a bar that fronts for a safe house for
any freelancers who are passing through.

12:18.363 --> 12:21.657
He runs in dodgy circles and there's a chance
that he could put a name to this face.

12:22.117 --> 12:24.368
Good. I'll talk to Foster.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.328
Get out there,
find out who this mystery man is.

12:27.831 --> 12:30.457
Right now, he's our only link to Chloe.

12:37.173 --> 12:41.301
Ambassador Foster has an outstanding
reputation in peace negotiations,

12:41.386 --> 12:43.595
having served as the U.K. representative

12:43.680 --> 12:46.557
in the international conference
on the former Yugoslavia...

12:46.641 --> 12:47.808
We just made things worse.

12:50.061 --> 12:53.397
No, we were close. The intel was good.
You made the right choice.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.274
- How can you say that?
- Mei...

12:55.358 --> 12:58.485
- No, it's Chloe we're talking about.
- Mei, I know.

12:58.570 --> 12:59.778
I understand,

12:59.863 --> 13:03.031
but involving Section 20
has put Chloe's life in danger.

13:05.160 --> 13:08.745
Do you remember
that first time we met, Robin?

13:09.873 --> 13:11.206
Rwanda.

13:12.709 --> 13:16.336
You walk into a warlord's camp
unarmed, unprepared,

13:17.005 --> 13:19.339
and you negotiate
the release of me and my men.

13:20.675 --> 13:23.302
You held your nerve like no one I'd ever seen.

13:24.429 --> 13:26.263
Yeah, well, I was different then.

13:27.891 --> 13:29.516
I didn't have Chloe.

13:32.729 --> 13:35.397
If you think we should keep
going down this path, Philip,

13:36.399 --> 13:38.358
then we keep going down this path.

13:38.735 --> 13:41.987
Sir, the North Korean delegations are waiting.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.947
Shall I have the Deputy Ambassador
meet them?

13:44.032 --> 13:46.074
- No.
- Oh, wait, dear.

13:48.453 --> 13:51.246
It's taken me years to bring them to the table.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.833
What would I do without you?

14:01.508 --> 14:03.175
He looks up to you.

14:05.053 --> 14:06.470
Always has.

14:08.556 --> 14:11.266
Losing his first wife almost broke him,

14:11.935 --> 14:14.019
but to lose Chloe, too...

14:14.103 --> 14:16.313
Mei, we have a lead.

14:17.440 --> 14:21.235
And right now my boys are gonna
talk to someone who can help us.

14:22.445 --> 14:23.987
We'll get Chloe back.

14:24.572 --> 14:25.948
I promise you.

14:27.659 --> 14:30.410
What we have to realize is that it's up to us

14:30.495 --> 14:35.290
to help North Korea break out
of this cycle of agreeing to

14:35.375 --> 14:39.461
and then terminating conferences
about its nuclear weapons program.

14:39.629 --> 14:43.340
Clearly, they cannot be allowed
to carry on selling their nuclear technology

14:43.424 --> 14:47.010
to countries like Iran, Syria, Pakistan.

14:47.095 --> 14:51.557
These talks are absolutely crucial in
not only bringing both sides together,

14:51.641 --> 14:55.477
but also increasing their standing
in the international community.

14:58.982 --> 15:00.190
Sir.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.910
Gentlemen, ladies.

15:11.995 --> 15:15.872
Since we have an awful lot of ground to cover
in a very short space of time,

15:16.249 --> 15:18.542
might I suggest we get started?

15:25.341 --> 15:27.134
Here, here, here, here, here.

15:32.015 --> 15:33.557
Here. Thank you.

15:33.641 --> 15:34.975
Hey. Come.

15:36.185 --> 15:39.229
We have 48 hours to
realistically get this girl back alive.

15:39.314 --> 15:42.024
- Hopefully Garland can help.
- I hear you.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.859
You don't snatch the ambassador's daughter

15:43.943 --> 15:46.069
unless you've got your eyes
on the bigger prize.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.530
Revenge? Ransom?

15:49.073 --> 15:52.159
Let's let the boss worry about that
and you and I focus on finding that girl.

15:52.994 --> 15:54.369
This is it.

15:54.912 --> 15:57.080
- "Bang Bang Club"?
- Yeah.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.374
Subtle. I like it.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.380
Oi! Private Garland. Need a hand?

16:05.548 --> 16:08.216
- Sergeant Stonebridge.
- Come here.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.052
- It's good to see you, man.
- Yeah, you too.

16:11.721 --> 16:14.222
- Great place you got here.
- No, it's a shithole.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.767
Rat-infested bar. Full of ladyboys.

16:17.894 --> 16:20.187
But you know, the best I could get for

16:20.271 --> 16:21.855
the price the British government
put on an arm.

16:22.565 --> 16:23.690
- You want a beer?
- Yeah.

16:23.775 --> 16:25.776
- Yeah, go on.
- Thanks.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.320
Need I remind you, this is about business.

16:28.404 --> 16:29.738
Yes, boss.

16:29.947 --> 16:33.116
This character here, he's part of a local gang.

16:33.242 --> 16:36.328
He's done a high profile snatch-and-grab,
and we need to find him fast.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.788
Any ideas?

16:38.414 --> 16:42.584
Yeah, I know him.
Aaron, muscle for his cousin, Ray McQueen.

16:44.462 --> 16:47.756
Ray McQueen.
Any ideas where to find that guy?

16:48.966 --> 16:50.592
I'll make some calls.

17:10.696 --> 17:13.240
Ooh. He's kicking.

17:14.075 --> 17:18.619
Hey, my boy's gonna be
a Muay Thai champion, I know it.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.664
"She" might be.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.624
Beautiful like her ma.

17:24.252 --> 17:25.919
And tough like her dad.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.136
Everything you need.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.621
I'm not looking.

18:02.457 --> 18:04.249
I haven't seen any of your faces.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.043
Oh, that's okay, Chloe, that doesn't matter.

18:07.670 --> 18:09.129
You can look at me now.

18:27.190 --> 18:29.024
What are you gonna do?

18:33.988 --> 18:36.198
- Do you live with your dad?
- What?

18:36.783 --> 18:38.366
Do you live with your dad?

18:40.536 --> 18:43.997
No, I go to college in England.
I was just visiting him.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.791
So you live with your mother in Britain?

18:48.628 --> 18:51.338
No, my mum died when I was 10.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.965
Oh, that's awful, I'm sorry to hear that.

18:54.634 --> 18:58.136
You know, I lost my folks
when I was a kid as well,

18:58.221 --> 19:00.972
and, uh, it can affect you really badly, that.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.850
Not having your proper family around.

19:06.187 --> 19:11.107
I know that when I have my little baba,
I'm gonna make sure I'm there 100%.

19:15.071 --> 19:18.406
I've got to say though, all things considered,

19:18.991 --> 19:23.078
I don't think I've turned out that badly, really.

19:31.087 --> 19:35.090
Got to be strong now, Chloe.
Nice and strong for your dad.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.175
Please don't.

19:37.260 --> 19:41.012
Please don't hurt me. Please, please don't.

19:41.097 --> 19:43.181
Please, no! No!

19:43.266 --> 19:46.434
Please don't hurt me! No!

19:53.609 --> 19:55.610
Haven't you got beautiful eyes?

19:58.197 --> 20:00.240
You should probably close them.

20:01.784 --> 20:02.951
This is gonna hurt.

20:08.291 --> 20:12.961
You know, I hope my little girl grows up
to be nice and strong like you.

20:54.170 --> 20:57.172
This is your fault. Your men, your tactics.

20:57.256 --> 21:02.010
- Robin, listen to me.
- He listened and this is what happened.

21:02.094 --> 21:05.764
You promised that Chloe would be safe.
You should leave.

21:05.848 --> 21:08.516
No. We can't leave.

21:09.185 --> 21:11.811
My daughter's finger is in
a fucking box because of you, Philip.

21:12.188 --> 21:13.355
So don't you...

21:14.357 --> 21:18.526
Don't you dare tell me you can't leave.
This is my fucking embassy!

21:18.819 --> 21:21.738
- You're here at my invitation only.
- I'm sorry, Robin, you misunderstand.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.615
It's not that we can't leave, it's that we won't.

21:24.367 --> 21:27.494
You said yourself these people
should be making demands.

21:27.870 --> 21:30.705
They should be asking for money, something.

21:32.458 --> 21:35.293
So whatever is going on here,
it's about a lot more than Chloe.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.379
And you know it.

21:45.721 --> 21:49.891
Martinez. Get up on Foster's phone,
e-mail, everything.

21:49.976 --> 21:52.560
I want to know who he's contacting,
who's talking to him.

21:52.728 --> 21:53.728
Roger that.

21:55.147 --> 21:58.358
I thought you two were buddies?
Isn't that why we're here?

21:58.442 --> 22:01.069
Well, McQueen's people just delivered
one of his daughter's fingers to him.

22:03.364 --> 22:05.991
- Have they made demands yet?
- Not yet.

22:06.075 --> 22:07.534
Then why take the daughter and do nothing?

22:07.910 --> 22:09.244
It's not nothing.

22:09.370 --> 22:12.998
They're just waiting. They're gaining leverage
until he'll do anything they want.

22:13.082 --> 22:15.750
I'm sure it's linked to his talks
with the North Koreans.

22:17.086 --> 22:18.253
You got a location for McQueen?

22:18.379 --> 22:19.921
Yeah, that mate of mine came through.

22:20.256 --> 22:22.757
He said Ray does a money pick-up
at a nightclub that he owns.

22:22.842 --> 22:25.510
Richmond, if you could put a tracker on him,
it might lead us to Chloe.

22:25.594 --> 22:26.970
Sure.

22:28.097 --> 22:30.432
Good. Clock's ticking. Let's get her back.

23:48.886 --> 23:50.345
You couldn't phone?

23:50.638 --> 23:53.348
What do you want, Changrok?

23:53.557 --> 23:57.393
The fight at the floating market
has caused our friends concern.

23:57.478 --> 24:00.355
You think I'm sitting on
a bed of fucking roses?

24:00.439 --> 24:03.775
Nobody told me about any soldiers
rocking up and killing my crew.

24:03.901 --> 24:06.027
They said this was gonna be
a simple bit of work,

24:06.112 --> 24:07.737
take the girl, Foster would roll over.

24:07.822 --> 24:10.281
No one expected him to call these people.

24:10.366 --> 24:12.200
Yeah, well, maybe they should
have done their homework

24:12.284 --> 24:14.202
before they asked me to take the girl.

24:17.206 --> 24:19.165
Would you like to call them and discuss it?

24:21.043 --> 24:22.710
I thought not.

24:24.338 --> 24:28.216
Ensure Foster takes this
to the right place at the right time.

24:28.551 --> 24:29.843
You know, I don't know what you're on,

24:29.927 --> 24:32.428
but I'm not getting
anywhere near enough for this shit.

24:32.596 --> 24:35.932
Money shouldn't be
your primary concern, Ray.

24:36.183 --> 24:39.227
With the baby on the way... How long now?

24:39.311 --> 24:40.603
Fuck you, is how long.

24:43.107 --> 24:45.441
Fatherhood is a blessing.

24:46.527 --> 24:48.570
It will change you forever.

24:49.738 --> 24:54.367
But these final few weeks are
a dangerous time for mother and child.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.744
You threaten me again...

24:57.496 --> 24:59.080
Threaten me again...

25:16.599 --> 25:19.142
- You got anything, Mike?
- No, not yet.

25:20.644 --> 25:23.021
Zero, this is Bravo Team.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.940
- Still no eyes on McQueen.
- Copy that.

25:26.025 --> 25:28.818
- Patching you into the club CCTV.
- Got it.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.366
Good signal. Standing by.

25:35.701 --> 25:36.910
Copy that.

25:57.765 --> 25:59.307
Heads up, guys.

26:13.656 --> 26:14.739
Everything okay?

26:14.823 --> 26:16.824
- Make sure Foster gets this.
- Yeah, all right.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.326
- Let me know when he's got it, yeah?
- Yeah.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.954
- Hey, it's important.
- It's done.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.041
- Boys.
- Boss.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.505
Zero, this is Bravo Team.

26:30.881 --> 26:32.799
Target is entering the building.

26:32.967 --> 26:34.050
Copy that.

26:34.134 --> 26:36.302
Bravo Three, move in.

26:36.387 --> 26:37.679
Got it.

26:42.059 --> 26:43.518
Like what you see?

26:44.561 --> 26:46.187
You know I do.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.856
Can't wait to debrief you later.

26:49.066 --> 26:50.817
Hmm.

26:51.235 --> 26:53.695
What? Oh, come on, he knows.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.364
You know, don't you, Mikey?

26:57.032 --> 26:59.826
What, you two? Since when?

27:00.911 --> 27:02.829
You two are wankers.

27:03.664 --> 27:05.540
And I'll talk to you later.

27:06.041 --> 27:08.251
Ooh, I look forward to it.

27:10.754 --> 27:13.089
He's an A-class asshole, all right?

27:13.590 --> 27:15.883
- So be careful.
- I'll be fine.

27:16.719 --> 27:17.927
Go get 'em.

27:31.025 --> 27:32.734
Fuck, she's hot.

27:34.111 --> 27:37.363
- Should I go in with her?
- No, we've been made, remember?

27:37.448 --> 27:39.407
- If we go in, we blow it.
- Yeah, but, Mike...

27:39.491 --> 27:41.451
Oi, she's been a soldier

27:41.535 --> 27:43.411
- longer than she's been your girlfriend.
- Yeah.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.580
She knows what she's doing.

28:13.776 --> 28:16.319
Zero, eyes on target. Moving in.

28:34.254 --> 28:35.671
Catch you later, babe.

28:44.932 --> 28:47.475
- Sorry, sorry.
- It's all right.

28:47.935 --> 28:49.685
Hey, can I get you a drink?

28:49.895 --> 28:52.188
- I'm good, thanks.
- You sure?

28:52.439 --> 28:53.856
Yeah.

28:55.317 --> 28:56.734
Shit!

29:15.379 --> 29:17.422
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

29:26.890 --> 29:30.518
McQueen has taken Bravo Three
to a private booth on the main floor.

29:42.865 --> 29:43.948
- Boss, boss!
- What?

29:44.032 --> 29:45.575
Problem in the club. Boss!

29:56.336 --> 29:59.255
- Fuck. Hey, you all right?
- I'm okay.

30:01.049 --> 30:04.969
- Damien, I'm okay. Go!
- Yes, boss.

30:08.515 --> 30:09.640
Oi, McQueen!

30:16.398 --> 30:19.817
Tell me where the girl is!
Where is she? Where's the fucking girl?

30:27.451 --> 30:29.827
You met me cousin? Whoo-hoo! Bhoo!

30:30.245 --> 30:31.829
Oh, he's a fucking lunatic.

30:31.914 --> 30:33.539
Killed a man once in the Octagon.

30:34.208 --> 30:36.292
Finish him off, son.
Hurry up, we've got things to do.

30:36.543 --> 30:39.253
Come on. Up you get, lad!

31:25.634 --> 31:27.009
- Get in!
- Come on!

31:28.637 --> 31:29.845
- Come on, mate!
- Come on!

31:31.473 --> 31:33.349
Ah, shit! Go, go, go, go, go!

31:36.645 --> 31:39.063
- I thought you were good at fighting?
- Guess I'm rusty.

31:39.147 --> 31:41.983
- Don't worry, I'll get him next time.
- Yeah, get in line, he's mine.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.901
Richmond, tell me you put the tracker on him?

31:43.986 --> 31:46.279
Yeah, I did. Zero, have you got him?

31:46.363 --> 31:49.865
Okay, he's two blocks northwest of you.
Hang a left at the end of the street.

32:06.967 --> 32:08.676
Take over for a second, I just...

32:14.600 --> 32:16.434
Bravo Three, stay on course.

32:16.518 --> 32:18.227
Target is two clicks north of you.

32:23.233 --> 32:24.817
Where the hell is Foster going?

32:34.536 --> 32:36.162
Why are you calling this number?

32:36.246 --> 32:38.080
Lee, listen. It's done.

32:38.206 --> 32:40.291
I'm gonna cut this little bitch up
and I'm gonna dump her.

32:40.375 --> 32:44.170
You do not make decisions, Ray.
You follow orders.

32:44.254 --> 32:46.297
I've got soldiers all over me.

32:46.381 --> 32:47.965
They've come to the fucking club tonight.

32:48.050 --> 32:53.554
You follow orders because you know
you are small, insignificant.

32:54.306 --> 33:00.436
That your wife and unborn child
only remain alive because we say so.

33:00.896 --> 33:03.648
Keep the girl alive until we are done.

33:04.191 --> 33:08.569
After that, kill her, sell her, it does not matter.

33:09.112 --> 33:12.239
What does matter is that
Foster delivers the package.

33:18.038 --> 33:19.080
Come on.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.332
Hey, you!

34:03.583 --> 34:05.042
Mr. Foster.

34:22.310 --> 34:23.561
Zero, have you got him?

34:23.895 --> 34:25.062
Still no visual on McQueen.

34:25.355 --> 34:27.313
Bravo Team, the target is right ahead of you.

34:30.944 --> 34:32.319
You're gonna lose him, you want me to drive?

34:32.404 --> 34:34.905
Look, unless you can make
this thing fly, you won't do any better.

34:43.248 --> 34:44.665
Shit.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.138
Don't you fuck me about, okay?

35:00.432 --> 35:01.515
That's him, that's him right there.

35:02.893 --> 35:05.770
What the fuck? He's got Chloe with him!
Go, go, go, go, go!

35:05.854 --> 35:07.354
We got eyes on the girl.

35:11.610 --> 35:12.902
Fuck!

35:14.196 --> 35:15.529
Hey!

35:16.364 --> 35:17.531
Move!

35:20.494 --> 35:22.369
Come on! Go, go, go! Go!

35:23.205 --> 35:24.413
Fuck off!

35:26.708 --> 35:29.043
- Move! Move! Come on!
- Excuse me!

35:36.259 --> 35:37.343
Oh, my God!

35:37.761 --> 35:39.261
Fuck.

35:39.554 --> 35:42.973
Move! Move! Get out of the fucking way!

35:47.979 --> 35:49.855
- Hello.
- Dad?

35:49.940 --> 35:52.316
Oh, God, Chloe!

35:52.609 --> 35:54.652
Dad, I think... I think they're going to...

35:54.736 --> 35:55.903
Shut up.

35:56.363 --> 35:58.197
Those are the last words
you're gonna hear from your daughter

35:58.281 --> 35:59.615
unless you do exactly what I say

35:59.741 --> 36:02.076
and you deliver that package
to the North Koreans, you understand?

36:03.078 --> 36:04.995
The North Koreans...

36:07.332 --> 36:10.501
You want me to bomb my own embassy?

36:10.794 --> 36:13.337
- Clock's ticking, Ambassador.
- Dad!

36:30.146 --> 36:31.397
Fuck.

36:47.330 --> 36:49.707
Robin? What are you doing?

36:49.791 --> 36:52.459
- Is she safe?
- We have eyes on, Robin.

36:53.295 --> 36:54.587
Is she safe?

36:56.756 --> 36:59.300
We're close.
What have you got in the bag, Robin?

36:59.384 --> 37:03.637
You've got 13 minutes to rescue Chloe, Philip.
After that...

37:04.389 --> 37:05.806
Robin, wait!

37:10.812 --> 37:14.106
Martinez, tell Scott and Stonebridge
they have exactly 13 minutes

37:14.190 --> 37:15.399
to get the girl back.

37:16.151 --> 37:18.694
Copy that, I've got 13 minutes on the clock.

37:18.820 --> 37:20.070
Not a second more.

37:22.324 --> 37:24.533
- Bobby. Bobby!
- Hey.

37:25.368 --> 37:26.660
Two white guys are coming in here.

37:26.745 --> 37:27.953
I don't want them getting out alive,

37:28.038 --> 37:29.580
- do you understand?
- Yes, boss.

37:33.168 --> 37:35.711
Okay, it looks like McQueen
has taken her to the Khlong Toei market.

37:36.338 --> 37:38.255
- Is that bad?
- It's a gang stronghold

37:38.340 --> 37:40.049
and the city cops won't even touch it.

37:41.176 --> 37:42.384
Oh, brilliant.

37:43.053 --> 37:45.804
Heading to Khlong Toei now.
Zero, guide me in.

37:45.889 --> 37:47.014
Copy that.

37:50.685 --> 37:53.896
All right, he's 100 yards southwest of you.
Hang a left.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.606
You've got 10 minutes.

37:57.525 --> 37:58.901
Wow.

37:59.861 --> 38:01.862
100 yards in 10 minutes?

38:02.739 --> 38:03.948
It's nothing.

38:04.032 --> 38:06.283
- Through there?
- Yeah.

38:07.577 --> 38:10.955
Yeah. If it was easy, bud, anyone could do it.

38:11.539 --> 38:14.416
I'll tell you what,
let's go get that girl back, huh?

38:14.542 --> 38:17.086
You and me, walk in the fucking park, dude.

38:46.950 --> 38:50.160
McQueen is 100 meters
to your south-southeast.

38:50.245 --> 38:52.496
Get inside, get inside.

39:04.342 --> 39:05.759
Robin!

39:06.594 --> 39:07.803
Robin!

39:09.806 --> 39:10.889
Robin!

39:17.063 --> 39:18.188
Robin!

39:18.940 --> 39:20.816
- Sergeant.
- Sir!

39:21.276 --> 39:23.652
Stop this man, he's a security risk.

39:27.782 --> 39:30.701
- Shoot him if you have to.
- Listen to me very carefully.

39:31.828 --> 39:36.040
It's the ambassador who's the security risk.
Do not let him in.

39:36.958 --> 39:38.459
Hands in the air!

39:39.586 --> 39:40.627
Down on your knees!

39:40.837 --> 39:44.131
Robin, my boys are close.

39:48.553 --> 39:49.553
Ahh!

39:58.772 --> 40:01.565
- I'm Lieutenant Colonel Philip Locke.
- I know who you are, sir.

40:01.649 --> 40:05.486
Now keep your hands where I can see
them and get down on your knees.

40:05.612 --> 40:07.488
- Okay.
- I need some backup.

40:21.503 --> 40:22.836
We've got six minutes.

40:29.552 --> 40:30.886
Fuck!

40:39.979 --> 40:43.107
What the fuck happened? You were
supposed to keep them in the club.

40:43.191 --> 40:45.859
- There was a bit of a situation.
- Bit of a fucking situation?

40:45.985 --> 40:47.736
Go and sort it now!

40:48.029 --> 40:51.115
I'll fucking sort this, all right? Come on.

40:54.202 --> 40:55.953
We're pinned down here, mate.
We've got to move!

40:56.037 --> 40:57.871
- Hang on.
- Fuck you.

41:06.548 --> 41:08.173
Scott, move, move, move!

41:11.052 --> 41:12.761
Move, Scott, move!

41:15.515 --> 41:17.349
Scott, on me! On me!

41:29.529 --> 41:30.696
Fuck!

41:34.659 --> 41:35.993
Fuck.

41:36.744 --> 41:38.078
I've got you.

41:39.998 --> 41:41.874
Martinez! Which way?

41:42.041 --> 41:44.376
McQueen is 100 yards
to your south-southeast.

41:44.460 --> 41:45.752
It's a fucking maze in here.

41:45.962 --> 41:48.088
Both go southeast, fuck sake.

41:48.756 --> 41:51.133
- All right, Mike, which way?
- I'm gonna go that way.

41:51.551 --> 41:53.051
- I'm going that way.
- See you there.

41:53.136 --> 41:54.803
- Shit.
- He's just ahead of you guys.

41:54.929 --> 41:57.306
- You've got five minutes.
- Fuck!

42:07.275 --> 42:10.485
Scott, he's 30 yards ahead of you,
make a right.

42:12.989 --> 42:15.574
Get down, get down, stay there.

42:20.205 --> 42:21.622
Fuck!

42:22.290 --> 42:23.916
Fucking you again!

42:25.793 --> 42:29.421
Bravo One, come in. Mike, you there?

42:29.505 --> 42:30.964
- Where are you?
- Zero!

42:32.467 --> 42:33.634
Mike!

42:35.511 --> 42:37.721
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

42:40.600 --> 42:43.644
- Martinez, which way?
- Not that direction, turn around.

42:43.853 --> 42:45.354
Really? Turn around where?

42:45.438 --> 42:46.605
- Hang left.
- Here?

42:46.689 --> 42:48.023
You've got three minutes.

42:50.985 --> 42:52.486
You kill a man in the Octagon, eh?

42:53.446 --> 42:54.905
You're not in the fucking Octagon anymore.

42:54.989 --> 42:56.490
Fucking come and get it then.

42:57.283 --> 42:59.660
Scott, 25 yards, then right.

43:02.956 --> 43:06.500
Got it. Fuck, it's a dead end!

43:08.336 --> 43:09.378
Jesus!

43:31.025 --> 43:32.442
Martinez, do you have eyes on?

43:32.527 --> 43:36.405
Okay, I've got Foster, he's headed
for the North Korean breakout room.

43:57.885 --> 44:00.554
- I need to see the General urgently.
- Robin.

44:00.680 --> 44:01.763
- Stop right there!
- Whoa, whoa.

44:01.889 --> 44:02.973
- Robin...
- Put your hands up.

44:03.057 --> 44:04.850
I am begging you, do not do this.

44:04.934 --> 44:06.435
Don't fucking move!

44:07.687 --> 44:13.650
Tell me you wouldn't give everything
to have your son alive again now.

44:15.570 --> 44:17.821
Believe me, I am not the threat here!

44:17.905 --> 44:19.489
Robin, for God's sake!

44:22.994 --> 44:24.828
General Ong Ji-Woo...

44:34.172 --> 44:36.048
Okay, guys, you've got two minutes.

44:38.760 --> 44:42.054
I have dedicated my life to peace.

44:42.597 --> 44:43.889
Please.

44:48.561 --> 44:50.437
Tried to find ways to

44:52.690 --> 44:56.360
bring people together,
to find ways of saving lives

44:56.444 --> 44:58.403
and avoiding conflict.

44:58.696 --> 45:02.699
I've shown humility
before cruel and brutal men

45:02.784 --> 45:07.162
because I believe
that violence is not the answer.

45:07.372 --> 45:08.872
Thirty seconds, guys.

45:08.956 --> 45:10.374
- Run!
- Twenty-nine...

45:10.458 --> 45:13.710
Violence can never solve
the differences we have.

45:13.795 --> 45:17.214
- Violence cannot win the peace.
- 27, 26... Scott!

45:17.298 --> 45:18.548
Ten yards ahead of you.

45:19.967 --> 45:22.969
I believe all these things, General,

45:23.805 --> 45:28.183
but what I know is that none
of this means anything

45:29.644 --> 45:31.144
without my daughter.

45:31.687 --> 45:34.731
You're right on top of them. Straight ahead.

45:34.816 --> 45:37.359
- He's right in front of you.
- This is nothing personal.

45:37.819 --> 45:40.737
You're just a loose end
that I've got to tidy up, that's all.

45:41.614 --> 45:42.864
That's the building, he's there.

45:44.826 --> 45:46.326
Five meters.

45:46.661 --> 45:47.994
You must be right on him.

45:55.253 --> 45:56.503
I am so sorry.

45:57.505 --> 45:59.464
- Scott?
- In here, Mikey.

46:02.844 --> 46:04.761
- It's okay.
- Richmond, get her back to her father.

46:04.846 --> 46:07.097
Zero, we have the girl.
I repeat, we have Chloe.

46:07.181 --> 46:08.515
Copy that.

46:11.853 --> 46:14.062
Colonel, they have the girl, they have the girl.

46:14.147 --> 46:16.940
Chloe's safe! Robin, Chloe's safe!

46:17.024 --> 46:18.942
Ten, nine...

46:19.026 --> 46:20.318
Ray, drop the gun.

46:20.445 --> 46:24.698
...eight, seven, six...

46:25.366 --> 46:26.533
Five...

46:28.035 --> 46:29.035
Four,

46:30.413 --> 46:31.997
three,

46:33.875 --> 46:35.208
two...

46:44.719 --> 46:46.178
Go!
