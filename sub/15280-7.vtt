WEBVTT

00:18.620 --> 00:21.578
No!No!No!

00:21.580 --> 00:24.208
No, Mommy, don't let him get me!

00:28.460 --> 00:31.076
Sam! He ruined my picture, Mom!

00:31.080 --> 00:32.877
It's okay, honey. We'll make another one.

00:32.880 --> 00:35.667
Chris, I've asked you not to get him
worked up before bed.

00:35.670 --> 00:36.955
Gee, we're just playing.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.825
We've got a 12-hour car ride tomorrow,

00:38.830 --> 00:40.070
and now he's going to be up
half the night.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.742
Okay, okay. Kids, go get Ben.

00:43.290 --> 00:44.917
But my picture!

00:44.920 --> 00:46.740
_ You can work on it
In the car tomorrow, honey.

00:46.750 --> 00:48.741
-On the way to Disney World!
-Yeah!

00:48.750 --> 00:50.490
-Okay!
-Disney World!

00:53.960 --> 00:56.997
You do realise I am the only adult
in this house?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.377
Well, isn't that what you love about me?

00:59.380 --> 01:03.168
Every once in a while I would like
a tiny bit of help, Mr Crawford.

01:03.170 --> 01:05.456
-You got it, Mrs Crawford.
-Thank you.

01:06.710 --> 01:08.325
Ben!

01:08.330 --> 01:11.959
-Ben! Ben!
-Ben, where are you?

01:12.580 --> 01:17.916
-Where are you, Ben

01:17.920 --> 01:20.571
-Where are you?
-Ben!

01:22.790 --> 01:24.826
He's not coming, Dad!

01:35.460 --> 01:36.950
Good boy, Ben.

01:51.380 --> 01:52.824
Hey, Sam...

01:53.750 --> 01:56.207
Just let him sleep with us. It's okay.

02:01.710 --> 02:03.780
-Dad

02:03.790 --> 02:06.668
-I love you.
-I love you, too, kiddo.

02:17.120 --> 02:20.078
This is WDCW 88.8 on your dial.

02:20.080 --> 02:21.206
Good morning, folks.

02:21.210 --> 02:24.077
It is time to get up, get out,
and enjoy this day.

02:24.080 --> 02:26.662
The forecast for you,
it's going to be mostly sunny,

02:26.670 --> 02:28.160
brisk easterly winds today.

02:28.170 --> 02:30.456
You can expect a high of near 75.

02:30.460 --> 02:32.872
Clear tonight, with a low near 61.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.609
-Checking out tomorrow's forecast...-Chris.

02:34.620 --> 02:37.077
_ ...more sunshine
and slightly warmer temperatures...

02:38.170 --> 02:39.455
Sam?

02:49.330 --> 02:51.616
B.A.U. Headquarters
F.B.I., QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

02:51.620 --> 02:56.614
Dr Thomas Fuller wrote,
"With foxes, we must play the fox."

03:05.380 --> 03:07.826
Crawford family. Butchered in their home.

03:08.250 --> 03:10.070
Murder-suicides?

03:10.080 --> 03:12.412
That's what we have to find out.

03:49.210 --> 03:51.667
He's so gorgeous.
-Thank you.

03:51.670 --> 03:54.377
If you find baldness
and wrinkles attractive.

03:54.380 --> 03:58.783
Look at his little widdy biddy nose.
Don't you want one of these?

03:58.790 --> 04:00.826
Mmm. I'll stick to practicing.

04:03.960 --> 04:05.109
Congratulations.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.326
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

04:06.330 --> 04:08.821
She's amazing. I'm a little terrified.

04:09.790 --> 04:11.667
-Well, we should get going.
-Okay.

04:11.670 --> 04:13.786
A pleasure seeing you, Mrs Hotchner.

04:13.790 --> 04:14.996
-Bye bye.
-Bye.

04:16.170 --> 04:17.535
-Bye, sweetie.
-Bye.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.490
-Bad?
-The worst.

04:23.420 --> 04:25.991
Crawford family. Murdered three days ago.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.661
I saw it on the news.

04:27.670 --> 04:30.321
They were found
in the basement of their house.

04:30.330 --> 04:32.571
Bags packed for a vacation
they never took.

04:32.580 --> 04:34.286
Reporter said it was a murder-suicide?

04:34.290 --> 04:35.951
The father stabbed them all
and then shot himself?

04:35.960 --> 04:38.372
That's the conclusion
Maryland State Police came to.

04:38.380 --> 04:39.608
The gun was found next to the father,

04:39.620 --> 04:41.372
he had gunpowder residue
on his right hand.

04:41.380 --> 04:42.824
And now you must have
some compelling reason

04:42.830 --> 04:44.661
to think that Chris Crawford
didn't off his family?

04:44.670 --> 04:45.910
Yeah.

04:45.920 --> 04:49.287
Another murdered family, the Millers,
found a month ago.

04:49.290 --> 04:52.748
The mother, Reese Miller,
her two children and her new husband.

04:53.620 --> 04:55.952
Again, they were found in the basement,

04:55.960 --> 04:58.781
and like the Crawfords, their suitcases
were packed for a vacation.

04:58.790 --> 05:00.496
Both cases, the bodies were discovered

05:00.500 --> 05:02.912
five days after their vacations
were supposed to have started.

05:02.920 --> 05:05.992
Yet the coroner determined that they
had been dead only 24 hours.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.288
So, for four days both families
remained in the house.

05:09.290 --> 05:11.702
Location of the bodies in both cases,
the basement.

05:12.540 --> 05:14.667
That indicates a level of organization.

05:14.670 --> 05:17.878
With a quick but disorganized
application of overpowering force.

05:17.880 --> 05:20.531
If these aren't murder-suicides,
someone's doing a damn good job

05:20.540 --> 05:23.782
Possibly this man. Eric Miller.

05:24.250 --> 05:26.320
Biological father of the Miller children.

05:26.330 --> 05:29.788
Arlington PD issued a BOLO for Miller
after the bodies were discovered.

05:29.790 --> 05:32.532
Ex-wife Reese Miller_ _
had a restraining order against hIm

05:32.540 --> 05:33.825
for domestic violence.

05:33.830 --> 05:37.038
-When did she get remarried?
-The week before they were killed.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.747
Violent husbands believe their wives
and children are property.

05:39.750 --> 05:41.911
Reese Miller getting remarried
possibly made him snap.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.411
Well, the Virginia cops
finally located Eric Miller last night

05:44.420 --> 05:46.456
responding to a drunken disturbance
at a motel,

05:46.460 --> 05:47.825
where Miller had been hiding out.

05:47.830 --> 05:51.163
When they found him, they discovered
blood on his black leather jacket.

05:52.040 --> 05:53.280
It belonged to his children.

05:53.290 --> 05:55.952
Was any of his DNA found
at the Crawford house?

05:56.540 --> 05:58.531
-No.
-Did he know the Crawfords?

05:58.540 --> 06:00.076
If he does, he's not saying.

06:00.080 --> 06:02.207
In fact, he hasn't said a word
since his arrest.

06:02.790 --> 06:05.111
The Arlington PD have asked us
to interview him.

06:06.250 --> 06:09.322
If anyone could apply
overwhelming force, he's your man.

06:09.330 --> 06:11.707
I want you to find out. Talk to him.

06:11.710 --> 06:13.917
You want me to talk to him?

06:14.250 --> 06:17.287
Yeah, you've done interviews before
with other agents running point.

06:17.290 --> 06:18.871
You can go solo.

06:21.170 --> 06:24.458
Morgan, the Crawford house
is a fresh crime scene.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.662
Once the Crawfords were
brought down to the basement,

06:27.670 --> 06:29.740
they must have known their fate.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.037
ME said they were all killed down here.

06:42.170 --> 06:44.991
Sam was found here, Emily over there.

06:45.920 --> 06:49.572
So, I'm the UnSub. How did I do it?

06:50.620 --> 06:52.872
Well, he had to bring them
down here first.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.495
-How?
-Had a gun.

06:54.500 --> 06:57.207
Okay. Used a gun to force them
down here, what next?

06:57.210 --> 06:58.450
-Stab them.
-Who first?

06:58.460 --> 07:00.200
The strongest. The father.

07:01.170 --> 07:05.243
He was found right there, and then
the mother, that's her right there.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.571
Well, how're you gonna keep the kids
from running away?

07:07.580 --> 07:10.322
Restraints. Can't aim a gun at them
and stab the mother at the same time.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.786
No restraints were found on the victims.

07:11.790 --> 07:14.611
-Because I took them with me.
-No ligature marks were found.

07:17.830 --> 07:19.707
Let's go upstairs, see how they lived.

07:22.290 --> 07:25.282
Sam Crawford, white male, aged five,

07:25.290 --> 07:26.746
multiple stab wounds,

07:26.750 --> 07:30.743
laceration _to the left ventricle.
No defensrve wounds present.

07:30.750 --> 07:35.699
Allison Crawford, white female,
32, multiple stab wounds,

07:35.710 --> 07:37.666
COD, exsanguination.

07:38.830 --> 07:43.199
Emily Crawford, white female, eight,
multiple stab wounds,

07:43.210 --> 07:45.576
COD, exsanguination.

07:46.540 --> 07:49.532
Christopher Crawford, white male, 36,

07:49.540 --> 07:53.328
point-blank single nine-millimetre
gunshot wound to the temporal lobe.

07:56.250 --> 07:57.615
Where's his wedding ring?

07:57.620 --> 07:59.451
It's not listed in his personal effects.

07:59.460 --> 08:01.781
He obviously wore one, so where is it?

08:10.290 --> 08:13.077
I'm Dr Spencer Reid from the FBI.

08:13.080 --> 08:16.959
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You don't mind?

08:16.960 --> 08:19.918
You got something
you wanna ask me, boy,

08:19.920 --> 08:21.820
you look me in the eye and you ask.

08:29.120 --> 08:32.112
-Three days ago...
-You're not looking at me.

08:37.880 --> 08:40.667
Three days ago,
the Crawford family was murdered.

08:40.670 --> 08:42.376
Is that right?

08:42.830 --> 08:45.378
-Did you know them

08:50.380 --> 08:53.668
They were killed in the exact same way
that your family was killed.

08:53.670 --> 08:54.819
And?

08:55.670 --> 08:58.662
I've been slapped around all night
by every cop in Virginia.

08:58.670 --> 09:02.458
Now what makes you think
a damned photo is gonna scare me?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.950
Is that what this is about

09:09.580 --> 09:10.956
You think I'm crazy, man?

09:10.960 --> 09:14.873
You think I suddenly snapped, and I
slaughtered my own wife and kids?

09:14.880 --> 09:18.828
You think I did this Is that what you think?

09:22.460 --> 09:24.530
Sit down. Now.

09:24.540 --> 09:28.453
Who's this I'm done talking to you people.

09:30.380 --> 09:32.416
You don't have to talk. Just listen.

09:32.420 --> 09:34.490
On the occasions _
you assaulted your Wife,

09:34.500 --> 09:37.321
you were intoxicated.
Once the effects of alcohol wore off,

09:37.330 --> 09:39.321
you were overcome
by feelings of remorse.

09:39.330 --> 09:42.788
I'm gonna tell you this just one time,
you shut your mouth!

09:42.790 --> 09:44.951
Genetic factors contribute to
alcohol-stress interactions.

09:44.960 --> 09:48.032
Your mother was an alcoholic
and she was often too drunk

09:48.040 --> 09:49.746
to stop the beatings
that your father gave you.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.661
-I think we should stop this.
-He's not finished.

09:52.040 --> 09:55.248
Aged six, you were orphaned to
a family where the abuse continued,

09:55.250 --> 09:58.037
only this time it was sexual.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.377
You shut your mouth,
or I'm gonna rip your face off.

10:01.380 --> 10:06.374
The abuse continued well into puberty.
But my one concern is, Eric,

10:06.380 --> 10:10.419
did you or did you not continue
the cycle with your own children?

10:17.380 --> 10:22.454
I never laid a hand on my children.
You hear me?

10:25.120 --> 10:26.701
I hear you.

10:27.880 --> 10:31.202
I found them like that.

10:31.210 --> 10:33.667
Dead. Bloodied.

10:34.290 --> 10:38.112
My babies. My sweet babies.

10:40.330 --> 10:43.879
I was crazy out of my mind,
I didn't know what to do,

10:43.880 --> 10:47.782
and I knew the cops
were gonna blame me, and they have.

10:48.170 --> 10:49.569
So you ran?

10:53.420 --> 10:56.378
-So what have I got now?
-You have your innocence.

10:58.790 --> 11:00.417
For the sake of your children,

11:00.420 --> 11:03.742
I believe that they, at the very least,
deserve the truth.

11:08.540 --> 11:13.204
I can't get the image
of my dead children out of my mind.

11:14.420 --> 11:19.778
Ty, my little boy,
he was clutching a piece of paper.

11:19.790 --> 11:22.827
I think it was a drawing,
maybe a painting.

11:23.830 --> 11:28.415
Please. I'd love to know
what he painted, Dr Reid.

11:36.620 --> 11:40.033
Interesting interrogation technique.
What'd you hope to accomplish?

11:40.040 --> 11:43.373
Miller was closed off,
defensive, hostile. I needed a way in.

11:43.380 --> 11:45.610
He suffered a breakdown
but I don't think he killed his family,

11:45.620 --> 11:47.702
-and I know he still loved his wife.
-Why do you say that?

11:47.710 --> 11:50.452
Even though they were divorced,
he still wore the wedding ring.

11:52.420 --> 11:55.207
The yard is overgrown,

11:55.210 --> 11:59.078
and like the roof, Chris Crawford's car
is in need of maintenance.

11:59.460 --> 12:04.033
Yet Allison Crawford's SUV
is in pristine condition.

12:04.040 --> 12:06.747
Says here that Allison drove
the kids at school.

12:06.750 --> 12:09.036
They were educated privately,
maybe the car was just an attempt

12:09.040 --> 12:11.998
-to show the other parents wealth.
-Like this house.

12:13.380 --> 12:15.701
Designer magazines
conspicuously placed.

12:15.710 --> 12:19.077
Expensive modern furniture.
Plasma TV.

12:20.170 --> 12:22.286
Behind the curtains, water damage.

12:22.290 --> 12:24.827
Allison spent money on the things
her friends could see,

12:24.830 --> 12:27.617
and neglected those they couldn't.

12:27.620 --> 12:29.918
The Crawfords
lived beyond their means.

12:30.210 --> 12:32.075
So where'd the extra cash come from?

12:32.080 --> 12:34.537
Get Garcia to check
their financial status.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.115
Emily.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.617
This painting is of this house.

12:50.620 --> 12:55.614
Strangely, for a child, it has no color.
It has lines, dimensions, but no color.

13:01.620 --> 13:05.454
-No dog collar was found, right?
-Maybe the dog didn't have one.

13:05.460 --> 13:07.872
Uh-huh. He'd have to have one. Come here.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.615
See that?

13:12.040 --> 13:15.532
This dog door opens automatically
via a chip in the dog's collar.

13:16.380 --> 13:18.917
If anything attempted
to get in without one,

13:20.830 --> 13:23.378
the alarm would have been activated.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.787
When the cops got here, the house
was locked tight and the alarm was hot.

13:29.790 --> 13:31.417
So, the night the Crawfords
were murdered,

13:31.420 --> 13:33.536
the only way in or out
was with a dog collar.

13:33.540 --> 13:36.373
Gideon, whoever killed this family
had to be a big guy.

13:36.380 --> 13:39.076
Chris Crawford
was a black belt in judo.

13:39.710 --> 13:40.825
So are you.

13:42.040 --> 13:46.033
But I've got a gun to your back.
Maybe you could take it from me.

13:46.040 --> 13:49.612
But your children are in the same room.
And if you fail, they die.

13:50.460 --> 13:53.452
Does it matter how big I am now?

14:03.120 --> 14:07.284
Bound or not, Allison Crawford
would've put up one hell of a fight.

14:07.710 --> 14:09.951
Emily and Sam
would have been sobbing.

14:09.960 --> 14:11.496
Crawford didn't kill his family.

14:12.210 --> 14:14.610
And there's no evidence Miller was
ever In the house or even knew them.

14:14.620 --> 14:17.783
Help me! Help! Please! Help me!

14:17.790 --> 14:19.496
No! No!

14:19.500 --> 14:21.616
-Please! Please! No!
-My God, no!

14:21.620 --> 14:24.498
No!

14:26.210 --> 14:28.701
What are you doing?

14:32.540 --> 14:34.610
Why didn't anyone hear them scream?

14:47.460 --> 14:50.418
I believe the UnSub
had control over this family.

14:50.790 --> 14:53.167
He may have separated
each family member.

14:55.120 --> 14:58.499
He tells the mother,
"If you scream, I'll kill your children."

14:59.250 --> 15:02.287
He tells the children,
"If you cry, I'll kill Mommy."

15:02.290 --> 15:06.249
The suspect found a way of
restraining them without leaving marks.

15:09.210 --> 15:15.536
Based on lividity, the ME estimates
that the father was the last to die.

15:16.830 --> 15:18.570
Which means he witnessed
the whole event.

15:18.580 --> 15:20.662
If he did spend time with both families,
he must have known

15:20.670 --> 15:22.035
he had the time to spend with them.

15:22.040 --> 15:23.871
Because he knew _
they were gomg on vacation.

15:23.880 --> 15:26.326
Look at travel agents, relatives,

15:26.330 --> 15:29.072
work colleagues, contract workers,
children's tutors.

15:30.210 --> 15:31.700
Gideon, we've been looking

15:31.710 --> 15:33.029
into the Crawford financials.

15:33.040 --> 15:35.577
Allison Crawford spent way
more money than Chris could afford.

15:35.580 --> 15:37.411
-They were in major debt.
-And Chris Crawford

15:37.420 --> 15:40.321
wrote a number of cheques
for a series of visits to a therapist.

15:40.330 --> 15:41.991
She had two cell phone accounts.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.206
One of them billed
to a separate address

15:43.210 --> 15:45.496
in Southeast Washington, DC.

15:46.290 --> 15:47.666
Did you get that?

15:49.540 --> 15:51.246
-Federal agent!
-FBI!

15:51.250 --> 15:52.956
-Federal agent!
-Clear!

15:57.960 --> 15:59.575
It's the cleanest thing in here.

16:03.830 --> 16:04.819
Clear.

16:10.830 --> 16:11.990
What's that?

16:13.790 --> 16:15.872
It's a child's painting.
It's a colonial house.

16:15.880 --> 16:18.451
Mom, Dad, two children out front
holding hands.

16:18.460 --> 16:20.030
And a big dog.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.417
I think this is the Crawford house,
it's signed by Emily.

16:22.420 --> 16:23.489
Strange.

16:23.500 --> 16:26.162
Eric Miller said he found his son
clutching a painting.

16:26.170 --> 16:28.877
-He wanted to know what was on it.
-What was on it?

16:28.880 --> 16:30.370
His son's blood.

16:42.080 --> 16:44.412
Whoa, whoa. Hotch! Hotch!

16:46.750 --> 16:49.457
Hey, whoa, whoa, easy...

16:52.750 --> 16:53.739
Freeze!

17:08.080 --> 17:10.321
I think you know why.

17:11.670 --> 17:13.069
That's mine.

17:13.080 --> 17:17.369
The colors indicate a self-confidence
With an outgorng personality.

17:17.380 --> 17:19.245
It shows an above-average intelligence.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.997
The child that painted this
was left-handed.

17:24.540 --> 17:26.872
Emily Crawford was left-handed.

17:27.790 --> 17:30.577
Frank, you're not.

17:31.540 --> 17:33.610
How'd you get the painting, Frank?

17:36.710 --> 17:38.917
Did you forget to take
your meds today, Frank?

17:38.920 --> 17:40.740
For a severe manic-depressive,
that's not good.

17:40.750 --> 17:44.663
-They make me feel wrong.
-Wrong enough to kill the Crawfords?

17:47.330 --> 17:49.412
Frank?

17:49.420 --> 17:52.287
-I did a bad thing.
-What did you do?

17:52.290 --> 17:56.169
I shouldn't have gone to the house.
Allison told me not to.

17:56.710 --> 18:00.328
I would never, never hurt Allie.

18:01.500 --> 18:04.879
-She's the only family I've got.
-Family?

18:04.880 --> 18:06.609
She's my sister.

18:11.420 --> 18:12.785
She's dead.

18:14.920 --> 18:16.490
She's dead.

18:17.620 --> 18:21.533
He killed them. Chris did.
I know he did it.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.950
What bad thing did you do?

18:27.960 --> 18:30.372
The rule was,

18:30.380 --> 18:32.780
I was never supposed to go
to the house.

18:32.790 --> 18:34.951
That was the only rule.

18:35.420 --> 18:41.529
Allison said if Chris saw me _
he would never let me see her again.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.417
He was gonna lock me up
in the loony bin.

18:44.420 --> 18:47.878
-He never liked me.
-You went to the house.

18:49.710 --> 18:52.918
She _said she couldn't
VlSlt me any more.

18:53.580 --> 18:59.109
I just wanted to see her.
Seeing Allison made everything better.

18:59.960 --> 19:03.498
But they cut my phone off that day.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.821
The day I went to see them,
they cut my phone off!

19:05.830 --> 19:09.118
I never would've gone to the house
if they hadn't cut off the phone!

19:09.420 --> 19:12.787
There's no way this guy could've
gotten into the house without a key.

19:12.790 --> 19:15.702
Knowing how Chris Crawford felt about
his brother-in-law,

19:15.710 --> 19:17.246
-do you see him having one?
-No.

19:17.250 --> 19:19.320
Frank, you went to the house.
What did you do?

19:19.330 --> 19:23.414
It was dark and cold.

19:24.420 --> 19:28.663
I went around to the side,
to look through the window.

19:28.670 --> 19:34.324
My breath steamed up the glass
and I wiped it clean.

19:34.920 --> 19:39.994
And I could see them
sitting down for dinner.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.208
I saw Emily and Sam.

19:44.580 --> 19:49.074
And Sam was crying.
I guess he was in trouble.

19:49.080 --> 19:51.412
-Did you see Allison?
-Yes.

19:53.210 --> 19:56.111
She was saying grace over the table

19:57.080 --> 20:01.824
and then she looked up and saw me

20:01.830 --> 20:03.786
and she mouthed something at me.

20:04.210 --> 20:08.499
I think it was, "Get the hell out."
So I left.

20:09.330 --> 20:12.618
-Did Chris see you?
-No, he wasn't there,

20:12.620 --> 20:15.828
but a friend was
at the head of the table.

20:15.830 --> 20:18.378
-You said, "a friend"?
-I saw someone.

20:18.380 --> 20:20.109
What did this person look like?

20:20.120 --> 20:24.955
I didn't see their face,
but tiny, really tiny.

20:25.460 --> 20:28.702
-White or black, Frank?
-I don't know, but...

20:28.710 --> 20:32.419
-What?
-The hair, it was red.

20:32.960 --> 20:36.418
If Frank saw them that day,
it wasn't Chris Crawford at the table.

20:36.420 --> 20:38.206
Maybe it was the suspect.

20:38.210 --> 20:41.668
And she wasn't saying, "Go away."
She was saying, "Help me."

20:47.790 --> 20:50.497
-It wasn't a friend.
-Frank.

20:50.790 --> 20:52.496
It wasn't a friend at all.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.456
It was him.

20:56.710 --> 20:58.575
He's the one who killed them.

21:01.420 --> 21:02.409
Frank.

21:04.580 --> 21:06.161
-Frank...
-No!No!No!

21:06.170 --> 21:07.910
-No!No!No!
-Frank, stop.

21:07.920 --> 21:10.741
-Frank, Frank.
-Let go!

21:10.750 --> 21:12.536
No, No!

21:12.540 --> 21:14.076
No!

21:14.080 --> 21:15.411
Frank!
-No!

21:15.420 --> 21:16.660
-Frank, calm down!
-No!

21:17.920 --> 21:19.535
-Frank! Come on!
-No,no!

21:21.250 --> 21:26.608
Both families had a dog
and both houses had a dog door.

21:28.460 --> 21:30.496
Fielding said that the person
he saw was small.

21:30.500 --> 21:33.162
Yeah, well, in order to get through
that door, you'd have to be 5'4", tops,

21:33.170 --> 21:34.285
and real thin.

21:34.290 --> 21:37.248
"When you have eliminated
the impossible, whatever remains,

21:37.250 --> 21:40.208
however improbable, must be the truth."

21:40.210 --> 21:42.246
Sherlock Holmes
was a fictional character.

21:42.250 --> 21:43.456
Whoever did this isn't.

21:43.460 --> 21:46.827
We can be pretty sure he's probably
found himself another family by now.

22:06.420 --> 22:08.570
-Let's just watch him sleep.
-No.

22:09.250 --> 22:11.571
We've got a long day ahead
of us tomorrow.

22:11.580 --> 22:14.378
-Can I kiss him?
-Both of you, out.

22:59.830 --> 23:03.288
Okay. No, I understand.
Yeah. I'd figured as much, thank you.

23:03.290 --> 23:05.576
He's been looking at those pictures
all morning.

23:05.580 --> 23:07.161
Well, I sure hope he sees a connection,

23:07.170 --> 23:10.788
because I've checked doctors, lawyers,
travel agents, tutors, contract workers...

23:10.790 --> 23:12.917
-I got nothing.
-Why target those families?

23:13.330 --> 23:14.786
Well, to know that,
we have to know how.

23:14.790 --> 23:17.702
All right, we know organised killers
are often skilled workers

23:17.710 --> 23:19.200
with above-average intelligence.

23:19.670 --> 23:22.662
A high birth status,

23:22.670 --> 23:25.707
and in most cases, male.

23:26.670 --> 23:29.070
In the workplace,
he's socially confident.

23:29.830 --> 23:33.459
And with women, sexually competent.

23:34.290 --> 23:37.032
Every offence is pre-planned.

23:38.750 --> 23:42.208
Targeting the victim is almost as
pleasurable as the actual kill.

23:42.210 --> 23:45.782
These guys, they're meticulous.
It's a compulsion.

23:45.790 --> 23:48.202
Everything has to have
its proper place.

23:48.210 --> 23:51.077
They do exhaustive amounts
of research on their victims.

23:51.750 --> 23:55.242
They watch their every move.
Every last detail is observed.

23:55.250 --> 23:59.493
Everything has to be written ever so
neatly in a book or possibly a journal.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.821
Like when the kids are coming home
from school,

24:01.830 --> 24:03.707
when Daddy will be home.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.039
Playtime, suppertime,
bath time, bedtime.

24:09.040 --> 24:11.577
Plan the work, work the plan.

24:11.580 --> 24:13.571
This is the way
that he maintains control.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.241
It's also how he personalises his target.

24:16.250 --> 24:19.117
So, nothing's left to chance,
and absolutely nothing

24:32.080 --> 24:34.207
is left out of place. Ever.

24:38.710 --> 24:41.167
So, he plans the work.

24:42.420 --> 24:45.162
And when he's good and ready,
he works that plan.

24:47.420 --> 24:49.376
He takes great pride in his job.

24:53.210 --> 24:55.826
I think the workplace
has to be the connection.

25:02.250 --> 25:05.822
This one is full of color and life.

25:06.170 --> 25:10.823
The one I found at Emily's house
has lines, dimensions, no color.

25:11.620 --> 25:14.418
I believe Emily was coerced
to paint this.

25:15.040 --> 25:18.749
It's a point of view.
It is his point of view.

25:19.540 --> 25:23.283
This is where the killer stood
and just watched the family.

25:29.750 --> 25:32.537
Each of the dead husbands
was missing his wedding ring.

25:32.540 --> 25:34.326
This is the UnSub's trophy.

25:34.710 --> 25:36.917
He targets a family
because he lost his own,

25:36.920 --> 25:38.956
and for a few days
he gets to play Daddy.

25:38.960 --> 25:41.246
And he can do whatever he wants
because no one's gonna come looking

25:41.250 --> 25:42.786
because they're supposed
to be on vacation.

25:42.790 --> 25:45.611
Let's get forensics to check the inside
of Chris Crawford's clothing.

25:45.620 --> 25:48.327
The suspect may've worn
the father's clothes, too.

25:48.330 --> 25:50.958
- Complete the fantasy.
-So why kill them?

25:51.420 --> 25:52.910
Because the fantasy can't last.

25:52.920 --> 25:56.708
Do we know anything that actually
helps us identify this bastard?

25:57.330 --> 25:58.820
Wait a minute.

25:59.380 --> 26:01.245
Chris Crawford worked for the IRS,

26:01.250 --> 26:05.493
and Reese Miller was a secretary
at the GAO.

26:06.170 --> 26:08.240
That makes them both
government employees.

26:08.250 --> 26:10.957
Let's check out
Chris Crawford and Reese Miller.

26:13.670 --> 26:16.161
He had his share of problems at home.
Who doesn't?

26:16.170 --> 26:18.741
But he didn't fix them
by killing his family.

26:18.750 --> 26:20.615
Were you aware he was in therapy?

26:20.620 --> 26:22.997
-He mentioned marriage counselling.
-He say who?

26:23.000 --> 26:26.322
Nope, and I didn't ask.
I don't like to pry.

26:26.330 --> 26:28.707
Well, that's surprising,
coming from an IRS agent.

26:30.960 --> 26:33.326
You mind if we go through
Chris' belongings,

26:33.330 --> 26:35.616
see if he had any connection to Miller?

26:36.000 --> 26:38.571
You're welcome to look through
anything you like.

26:42.710 --> 26:44.666
Family therapists.

26:44.670 --> 26:48.663
They often use children's paintings
to assess a family unit.

26:50.830 --> 26:52.707
We're all still in shock.

26:52.710 --> 26:55.372
Reese was a quiet woman.
She kept pretty much to herself,

26:55.380 --> 26:57.029
bell to bell, brought in her own lunch...

26:57.040 --> 26:58.325
-Mrs Raleigh...
-And she had two kids,

26:58.330 --> 26:59.911
but then you knew that.

26:59.920 --> 27:01.114
It's just so terrible.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.417
-I still can't believe it.
-Excuse me.

27:02.420 --> 27:05.241
And she was covering for one of
my women who is on maternity leave.

27:05.250 --> 27:08.162
She was always tired, you know.
But then, any woman married

27:08.170 --> 27:09.706
-to Eric Miller would be.
-Thanks.

27:09.710 --> 27:11.416
-He was a mean drunk.
-Mrs Raleigh?

27:11.420 --> 27:13.285
He hit her, you know.
She tried to cover it up.

27:13.290 --> 27:15.827
But concealer can only do
so much magic.

27:16.290 --> 27:18.030
-I should know.
-Mrs Raleigh...

27:18.040 --> 27:19.780
I'm sorry, I'm talking too much.

27:19.790 --> 27:22.702
Do you know if Mrs Miller was seeing
a marriage counsellor?

27:23.040 --> 27:26.328
-Reese kept pretty much to herself.
-You're not betraying any confidence.

27:26.330 --> 27:28.787
We need to know everything
about her life.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.240
Every Thursday I covered for her

27:34.250 --> 27:36.787
so she could take off early
to see a therapist.

27:37.500 --> 27:38.910
Thought it worked.

27:38.920 --> 27:42.242
She kicked the bastard out
and got remarried.

27:43.170 --> 27:44.819
Look what that got her.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.991
We've got to stop meeting
like this, Reid. People will talk.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.992
-But then, talk is cheap.
-Not when you're talking to a therapist.

27:53.250 --> 27:54.786
The Crawfords made
12 weekly payments

27:54.790 --> 27:58.749
to the Applewood Family Center.
What about the Millers?

27:59.460 --> 28:00.916
No, nothing here.

28:00.920 --> 28:02.990
How about pharmaceuticals?
No one gets therapy these days

28:03.000 --> 28:05.662
-without a healthy dose of medication.
-What're you implying, Reid?

28:06.000 --> 28:07.786
That everyone is medicated.

28:08.580 --> 28:10.912
-Did you just make a joke?
-No.

28:11.210 --> 28:14.418
-Statistics. They show that...
-Reid, next time, just say "yes", okay?

28:14.420 --> 28:17.662
Now, medication normally requires
a reimbursement from the HMO

28:17.670 --> 28:19.706
and since she works for
the government like you and I,

28:19.710 --> 28:21.951
we share the same
health care prowder.

28:22.790 --> 28:26.248
Are you hacking into
the government's HMO database?

28:26.250 --> 28:27.786
-Is that legal?
-Of course not.

28:27.790 --> 28:31.419
We'll both go to prison
and you'll be someone's bitch.

28:31.790 --> 28:33.576
-Rea|ly?
-Oh, right there.

28:33.580 --> 28:36.617
Good call, Reid.
Mrs Reese Miller, Diazepam.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.285
Who prescribed the meds?

28:38.290 --> 28:40.702
Dr R. Howard
at the Applewood Family Centre.

28:40.710 --> 28:43.281
Let's find out what he looks like.
Here we go.

28:47.080 --> 28:49.071
Dr Howard isn't a "he".

29:24.790 --> 29:27.611
Excellent, Lacy. Really wonderful.

29:27.620 --> 29:30.919
There's so much colour.
It's very lovely Indeed.

29:32.080 --> 29:33.820
Dr Rachel Howard,

29:34.080 --> 29:36.457
I'm Special Agent Aaron Hotchner
with the FBI.

29:36.460 --> 29:38.826
Come on, Lacy, come on.
Go with Mommy.

29:44.080 --> 29:45.456
Can I help you?

29:45.460 --> 29:48.031
I'm Agent Jason Gideon,
Behavioural Analysis.

29:48.040 --> 29:50.326
We both deal with the dysfunctional.

29:50.330 --> 29:54.209
Happily, in my line, the end results
aren't quite as unpleasant as yours.

29:54.620 --> 29:57.498
-Unless you're the Crawford family.
-Or the Millers. You knew them both.

29:57.500 --> 30:00.572
-Yes, I knew them.
-Ma'am,

30:00.580 --> 30:02.878
I think you should take a seat.

30:04.960 --> 30:06.029
Why?

30:07.500 --> 30:08.740
We're going
to have to check your alibi.

30:08.750 --> 30:11.537
Dig all you want. I have four teenagers.

30:11.540 --> 30:14.748
IfI had any time to myself,
it wouldn't be spent killing my clients.

30:14.750 --> 30:17.708
-You worked with both families?
-I assessed their cases.

30:17.710 --> 30:19.871
This office deals with
hundreds of families.

30:19.880 --> 30:22.576
Military, cops, lavwers,
congressmen, feds.

30:22.830 --> 30:25.116
I only met the Crawfords
and Reese Miller once.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.031
But you prescribed medication
for them?

30:27.040 --> 30:29.076
I'm the only medical doctor here.

30:29.330 --> 30:31.412
Who did you hand the cases over to?

30:31.420 --> 30:33.411
I'll have to check my files.

30:35.920 --> 30:37.535
You don't use a computer?

30:37.540 --> 30:39.781
Not all of us have embraced
the technical revolution.

30:39.790 --> 30:42.452
I keep everything filed,
it makes me feel more in control.

30:42.750 --> 30:44.877
And please, do not read into that.

30:48.250 --> 30:51.879
The Crawfords.
Karl Arnold dealt with their case.

30:51.880 --> 30:53.950
-What about the Millers?
-We'd like to see him now.

30:53.960 --> 30:56.747
We can't. He works a four-forty.
Four ten-hour days.

30:56.750 --> 30:58.741
He's off today,
but he'll be in first thing tomorrow.

30:58.750 --> 31:00.615
Do you have his home address?

31:02.580 --> 31:04.286
I'll get a team out to his house.

31:04.290 --> 31:06.417
In the meantime,
I'd like to see his office.

31:08.750 --> 31:10.706
The suspect's cell is going straight
to voice mail.

31:10.710 --> 31:12.075
Karl's a good man.

31:12.750 --> 31:15.992
That's what everybody says
until they find a body in the basement.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.615
-It's locked.
-I'll get security.

31:18.040 --> 31:19.780
No, we don't have time for that.

31:27.210 --> 31:30.247
-Someone will have to pay for that.
-Karl Arnold will.

31:33.210 --> 31:34.575
Gideon?

31:39.790 --> 31:41.109
Where is he now?

31:42.040 --> 31:44.281
-I can't believe Karl...
-Where is he?

31:45.170 --> 31:46.455
I don't know.

31:46.460 --> 31:49.497
If he's not at home
maybe he's gone to see his family.

31:49.960 --> 31:51.109
He's married?

31:51.120 --> 31:53.076
With two children. Karl Jr, and Sarah.

31:53.080 --> 31:55.412
How long ago
did the marriage collapse?

31:57.710 --> 32:01.202
About five years ago.
It wasn't a good time for Karl.

32:02.170 --> 32:03.990
He took some time off work.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.572
He couldn't concentrate,
he started drinking.

32:07.580 --> 32:08.911
-Yeah.
-I can't believe...

32:08.920 --> 32:10.660
What do you got?

32:10.670 --> 32:12.285
I would've seen...

32:13.920 --> 32:15.660
Oh, my God, I feel sick.

32:15.670 --> 32:17.570
Where does Karl's family live?

32:18.000 --> 32:19.740
She took the kids and moved to Idaho.

32:19.750 --> 32:21.615
They just raided Karl's home.

32:22.710 --> 32:24.416
He's not there.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.950
Cut it out, now. Both of you.

32:45.960 --> 32:48.372
Sarah, Karl Jr, go do your homework!

32:50.080 --> 32:52.071
Don't do that! That's not funny!

32:52.420 --> 32:53.489
Hello?

32:53.500 --> 32:56.287
VVhat

32:56.290 --> 32:58.326
Fay Arnold,
this is Federal Agent Aaron Hotchner.

32:58.330 --> 32:59.911
I'd like to know where
your ex-husband is.

32:59.920 --> 33:02.377
As long as he's nowhere near me,
I don't give a damn.

33:02.750 --> 33:04.820
We really need to find him.
When was the last time you saw him?

33:04.830 --> 33:07.822
I haven't seen him in over two years.

33:07.830 --> 33:09.457
He's a scary guy.

33:10.170 --> 33:12.786
But he did call me about an hour ago.

33:12.790 --> 33:14.826
I wish he would just go to hell
and stay there.

33:14.830 --> 33:15.956
What did he say?

33:15.960 --> 33:19.168
He just babbled on about
how precious family is.

33:19.790 --> 33:22.247
-Did he say where he was?
-No,no.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.411
He just wanted to talk to the kids.

33:24.710 --> 33:28.498
He said he'd just met a little girl
that reminded him of my Sarah.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.786
Did he seem upset Confused?

33:30.790 --> 33:35.113
He seemed like he always is.
Angry, controlling, manic.

33:35.460 --> 33:37.246
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

33:37.250 --> 33:38.410
No.

33:38.420 --> 33:43.323
But I did hear kids in the background,
and then someone started to cry.

33:43.330 --> 33:45.491
-That's when he hung up.
-Thank you.

33:49.540 --> 33:52.498
Arnold just called her.
She heard kids in the background.

33:52.500 --> 33:54.991
He's already in another family's house.

34:02.170 --> 34:03.819
Hotch, there's gotta be
hundreds of families here.

34:03.830 --> 34:06.492
Then we'll send an agent to
every last one of them if we have to.

34:06.500 --> 34:09.663
Karl Arnold, he has a boy and a girl,
just like the Millers and the Crawfords.

34:10.040 --> 34:12.452
-Target family will be the same.
-How could I have not seen it?

34:12.460 --> 34:13.745
Well, because he's that good.

34:13.750 --> 34:15.536
If he wasn't,
we would've caught him sooner.

34:15.540 --> 34:16.700
Does he have a journal?

34:16.710 --> 34:18.701
He writes everything down,
takes it everywhere.

34:18.710 --> 34:20.029
It's likely he also collects trophies.

34:20.040 --> 34:22.668
If they're not in his house,
they're right here, hidden in this room.

34:22.670 --> 34:25.207
From the families he killed.

34:25.210 --> 34:26.825
If he doesn't confess,
we'll need them as evidence.

34:26.830 --> 34:28.991
Here's one, the Harrises.
One boy, one girl.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.456
I've got a few.

34:30.750 --> 34:33.878
-The Boyds and the Dunkens.
-Wait. The Dunkens.

34:33.880 --> 34:36.531
That's not one of his cases,
that's mine.

34:36.540 --> 34:38.167
They have a baby boy

34:38.170 --> 34:41.708
and a slightly introverted
eight-year-old named Jackie.

34:41.710 --> 34:43.371
Jackie.

34:45.580 --> 34:48.458
-Jackie's work?
-He took it from my office.

34:48.460 --> 34:50.576
-Were they planning a trip?
-To the Adirondacks.

34:50.580 --> 34:53.208
-Let's go. Hotch, tear up the room.
-Here, take this.

34:53.830 --> 34:54.876
I'll call you some backup.

35:02.330 --> 35:06.164
We've got three adults, two children,
sitting at the dining room table.

35:19.960 --> 35:22.246
[-FBI! FBI!
-He 5 got my baby!

35:22.670 --> 35:24.570
-Ma'am, is he alone?
-Yes, he is!

35:24.580 --> 35:26.957
Where's the basement?
-Under the stairs!

35:26.960 --> 35:28.245
Son of a bitch.

35:28.250 --> 35:30.707
Get them out of here!
Get them out of here!

35:33.920 --> 35:35.160
Gideon! Gideon!

35:52.790 --> 35:53.779
Karl?

35:56.380 --> 35:58.109
Karl, it's the FBI.

36:08.170 --> 36:09.159
Karl...

36:09.920 --> 36:10.989
Shh.

36:13.790 --> 36:15.781
Why don't you give me the baby?

36:21.380 --> 36:22.369
Karl.

36:25.830 --> 36:27.457
Karl, I want you to look at me.

36:28.330 --> 36:33.495
I'm gonna put my gun away.
And I want you to hand me that baby.

36:51.500 --> 36:52.819
Hand me the baby.

36:56.420 --> 36:57.409
Knife!

37:05.540 --> 37:07.917
You move, I will break your neck.

37:11.920 --> 37:13.114
Okay.

37:20.210 --> 37:21.279
Hello.

37:23.420 --> 37:24.876
Let's go.

37:28.830 --> 37:31.071
Keep it moving.

37:37.210 --> 37:39.166
-Did he say anything?
-No.

37:40.420 --> 37:42.786
Can we tie him forensically
to the other crimes?

37:42.790 --> 37:46.248
Negative on foreign DNA.
He must've washed Crawford's clothes.

37:46.250 --> 37:48.241
Then we'll need a confession.

37:48.250 --> 37:50.457
-Can you get one

37:50.460 --> 37:52.701
-Yeah.
-Then, maybe.

37:54.960 --> 37:58.703
Emily Crawford was a very talented
and gifted girl.

37:59.420 --> 38:02.662
Her brother Sam,
a bright, energetic child.

38:04.250 --> 38:07.959
You watched them from the yard
for days, maybe even weeks.

38:08.750 --> 38:11.958
You learned everything about them.
You studied their every move

38:11.960 --> 38:13.916
and then you wrote it all down.

38:14.330 --> 38:16.207
May I have a glass of water?

38:16.580 --> 38:19.378
-Something wrong?
-No, I'm just thirsty.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.496
Water, please.

38:24.120 --> 38:26.702
Could you remove my shackles?
I'm clearly no threat to you.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.780
They stay on.

38:33.290 --> 38:36.498
_ You chose families that
reminded you of the one you lost.

38:36.960 --> 38:38.825
You stalked them, you bound them,

38:38.830 --> 38:41.242
you terrorised them,
and then you killed them.

38:41.500 --> 38:42.615
One by one.

38:44.460 --> 38:46.280
We have your journals, Karl.

38:48.120 --> 38:50.577
It's my job,

38:51.500 --> 38:53.957
to write everything down,
to get to know them.

38:53.960 --> 38:57.111
I can't help them solve their problems
without knowing background.

38:57.120 --> 38:59.668
I make home visits.

39:00.080 --> 39:03.117
Sometimes without their knowledge,
because people lie.

39:03.120 --> 39:05.452
You, of all people, should know that.

39:12.920 --> 39:17.789
Eric Miller was
an awful husband and father.

39:18.120 --> 39:21.374
Allison Crawford haemorrhaged money
her husband didn't have.

39:21.380 --> 39:23.245
That can strain any marriage.

39:29.920 --> 39:32.320
On the surface,
this looks like "any family, USA".

39:32.330 --> 39:34.537
Two-parent household,
two kids, a boy and a girl.

39:34.830 --> 39:36.036
But if you look a little closer,

39:36.040 --> 39:38.702
you'll see their body language
tells a different story.

39:38.710 --> 39:41.611
The woman and children
are distant from the man.

39:41.620 --> 39:44.418
Their smiles are stiff,
their eyes are frightened.

39:44.670 --> 39:48.037
Every hair is in place,
wearing their Sunday best.

39:48.540 --> 39:51.498
Their own private hell
being memorialised on film.

39:58.960 --> 40:00.416
Are you okay?

40:03.210 --> 40:04.450
It isn't right.

40:06.380 --> 40:07.665
What isn't?

40:08.170 --> 40:11.116
You've got the pictures mixed up!

40:11.670 --> 40:15.538
The one in the middle,
that is Sam Crawford's.

40:16.620 --> 40:20.112
It should be Ty Miller's!

40:21.460 --> 40:25.749
You need to swap them.
You need to make it right.

40:26.790 --> 40:27.950
This one here?

40:29.290 --> 40:32.282
What the hell
have I been trying to tell you?

40:32.710 --> 40:35.247
You're right. They're switched.

40:36.040 --> 40:38.998
That is Sam Crawford's foot
with the Miller family.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.161
But how did you know that, Karl?

40:59.250 --> 41:02.413
And I watched them
for a number of days.

41:03.420 --> 41:05.285
Always at night.

41:05.960 --> 41:09.999
Saw how they lived, how they loved.

41:10.710 --> 41:16.068
I would keep them apart until
the last night, until the last supper.

41:17.380 --> 41:19.746
Then I would bring them, one by one,

41:21.790 --> 41:23.496
down to the basement.

41:25.170 --> 41:29.789
The youngest first, the father last.

41:29.790 --> 41:31.109
Why, Karl?

41:34.420 --> 41:38.413
So he could see
what happens to families

41:38.960 --> 41:42.999
when the head of household
isn't strong.

41:47.880 --> 41:52.032
Wives wither, children perish.

41:57.460 --> 42:00.668
But me, I'm an excellent father.
