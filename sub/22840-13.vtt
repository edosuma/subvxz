00:02.172 --> 00:05.515
So Giles Corey decides,
my wife is not a witch.

00:05.562 --> 00:06.778
<i>And the sheriff is like,</i>

00:06.855 --> 00:09.451
<i>I'm crushing you!
You're a witch!</i>

00:09.528 --> 00:12.876
Halloween in the early
20th century was a straight up...

00:12.953 --> 00:14.579
<i>just bad.
And Elizabeth Krebs is like,</i>

00:14.656 --> 00:16.328
<i>How could these kids
even have it in them</i>

00:16.406 --> 00:18.003
<i>to take a piss on everything?</i>

00:18.080 --> 00:21.630
And Dracula is like,
let's have a party!

00:21.707 --> 00:24.383
<i>And he impales
everybody.</i>

00:25.122 --> 00:26.336
Oh.

00:42.647 --> 00:43.655
Oh, wait.

00:43.772 --> 00:45.037
- What?
- Well...

00:45.115 --> 00:46.944
You're taking your glasses off,
what are you doing?

00:47.022 --> 00:49.125
I have to put on
my prescription.

00:49.950 --> 00:52.314
Oh, yes, please.

00:52.391 --> 00:53.852
- Drink-or-treat.
- It's very spooky.

00:53.930 --> 00:55.008
Drink-or-treat.

00:55.047 --> 00:56.294
Is this stupid?

00:56.371 --> 00:57.688
Yeah, but...

00:57.765 --> 00:59.028
If we don't act stupid,

00:59.105 --> 01:01.532
how will we ever learn
how to be smart?

01:01.880 --> 01:03.867
Hello.
I'm Allan McLeod,

01:03.944 --> 01:06.593
and... today
we're gonna tell the story

01:06.670 --> 01:10.094
of the curse
of Giles Corey.

01:10.944 --> 01:12.359
Ooh.

01:12.821 --> 01:14.336
Boo.

01:14.556 --> 01:17.931
<i>Our story begins in
Salem, Massachusetts.</i>

01:18.008 --> 01:20.350
<i>The Puritans had just
settled the colony,</i>

01:20.427 --> 01:23.915
and they were very
much into biblical law.

01:23.992 --> 01:27.704
<i>So, a bunch of girls
started acting erratically.</i>

01:27.781 --> 01:30.623
<i>And a doctor checked
them out and he said,</i>

01:30.700 --> 01:33.235
<i>These girls are bewi...
bewitched!</i>

01:33.340 --> 01:36.894
<i>And thus began
the Salem witch trials.</i>

01:36.991 --> 01:37.991
Ooh.

01:40.330 --> 01:42.738
<i>So, these witch trials start.</i>

01:42.815 --> 01:47.603
<i>And Martha and Giles Corey are
just, like, eating popcorn,</i>

01:47.680 --> 01:49.922
and enjoying themselves,
and they're goi...

01:49.999 --> 01:51.857
and they're...
and they're excited about it,

01:51.934 --> 01:53.892
and they're like,
oh, I love you, honey,

01:53.969 --> 01:56.562
<i>and we're at the witch trials,
and isn't it fun</i>

01:56.639 --> 01:59.424
<i>that there might be witches 
among us?</i>

01:59.501 --> 02:02.227
So, the Puritans were
not very scientific.

02:02.304 --> 02:04.596
<i>You would have to, 
like, pee into a cup,</i>

02:04.673 --> 02:07.205
<i>and then they would,
like, pour the pee into,</i>

02:07.282 --> 02:10.380
<i>like, a cake, and then a dog
would have to eat the cake</i>

02:10.457 --> 02:14.396
and then, if ***
the person who peed into the cake

02:14.473 --> 02:16.735
felt pain
when the dog ate the cake,

02:16.812 --> 02:18.094
<i>then that person was a witch.</i>

02:18.171 --> 02:20.194
<i>And Martha's like,
that doesn't make any sense</i>

02:20.271 --> 02:23.388
<i>as far as, like, judging
whether you're a witch or not.</i>

02:23.465 --> 02:25.854
<i>And so,
Ann Putnam was like,</i>

02:25.931 --> 02:29.719
<i>you're a witch because
you're criticizing us.</i>

02:29.835 --> 02:33.867
<i>And so, Sheriff George Corwin
came in and was like,</i>

02:33.944 --> 02:35.734
<i>if you're accused of
being a witch,</i>

02:35.811 --> 02:38.032
<i>you're gonna
get hung and that's it.</i>

02:38.155 --> 02:41.813
<i>The trial is... is
arbitrary. It's not really...</i>

02:43.374 --> 02:44.772
- Ooh, excuse me.
- Was that...

02:44.849 --> 02:45.867
What was that?

02:45.944 --> 02:48.153
Phew, it's a little
something coming up.

02:49.417 --> 02:51.407
- It's all good.
- Okay good.

02:51.610 --> 02:53.759
<i>Martha Corey goes to trial,</i>

02:53.890 --> 02:57.422
and Giles Corey was just
swept up in the hysteria

02:57.499 --> 02:59.170
of the whole thing and
he's like,

02:59.247 --> 03:03.295
<i>well, our cat... died and that
could be a sign of a witch.</i>

03:03.372 --> 03:07.927
<i>And also, my... ox has
been having some issues.</i>

03:08.004 --> 03:08.992
<i>So...</i>

03:09.069 --> 03:11.255
<i>she could be a witch.
I mean, I don't know!</i>

03:11.332 --> 03:12.755
<i>But she could be a witch.</i>

03:12.832 --> 03:16.835
<i>Well, then, Martha goes to jail,
and... and, uh...</i>

03:16.912 --> 03:21.004
<i>Giles was like, I've been
caught up in the whole mania</i>

03:21.111 --> 03:25.111
<i>of the Salem witch trials,
and I need to relax</i>

03:25.188 --> 03:27.812
<i>and come to my senses,
and now that I've come</i>

03:27.889 --> 03:31.520
<i>to my senses I realize
my wife is not a witch.</i>

03:31.597 --> 03:34.557
<i>And I... I was... telling
tales out of school.</i>

03:34.634 --> 03:36.468
<i>And everybody's like,
so wait a second.</i>

03:36.545 --> 03:39.306
<i>You're doubting us, and
you're questioning us, like...</i>

03:39.602 --> 03:41.070
<i>That means you're a witch!</i>

03:41.147 --> 03:43.230
<i>And then Giles was like...</i>

03:43.868 --> 03:44.868
Ugh.

03:45.354 --> 03:47.500
These hiccups, dude.

03:47.577 --> 03:49.633
- Don't worry about them.
- All right. We're good.

03:50.008 --> 03:52.830
<i>And so, Sheriff Corwin
comes in, he says,</i>

03:52.907 --> 03:56.025
<i>all right, well, it's time
for me to torture you, baby.</i>

03:56.102 --> 04:00.494
<i>And my choice of torture
is pien de forte...</i>

04:00.667 --> 04:04.403
<i>Oh, ***.
Pien... Will Forte.</i>

04:04.480 --> 04:05.643
<i>God damn it.</i>

04:05.720 --> 04:08.072
Pier de tortogotortutu...

04:09.643 --> 04:12.447
So, Giles Corey was
given the sentence of

04:12.551 --> 04:16.822
<i>peine forte et dure,
and that basically meant</i>

04:16.899 --> 04:18.315
<i>we're gonna
put this board on you</i>

04:18.392 --> 04:21.015
<i>and then we're gonna put
a bunch of rocks on top of you</i>

04:21.091 --> 04:25.753
<i>and crush you until you
plead guilty or not guilty.</i>

04:25.830 --> 04:28.089
<i>So, they start putting
rocks on him</i>

04:28.166 --> 04:29.765
<i>and start pressing on him.</i>

04:29.842 --> 04:32.834
Wait.
We'll crush you the right way.

04:32.911 --> 04:33.995
Oh. No.

04:34.118 --> 04:36.023
- That's an ironing board.
- Come on!

04:36.100 --> 04:37.773
That's not what they had.

04:37.850 --> 04:40.467
That is not what they had, Allan.

04:40.549 --> 04:42.570
Don't... oh, me!

04:42.647 --> 04:44.820
- It hurts?
- I'm... yes, it hurts!

04:45.201 --> 04:47.417
You're a body on top of a body.

04:47.963 --> 04:49.152
<i>Okay. Anyway.</i>

04:49.229 --> 04:51.837
<i>The sheriff is like,
I'm crushing you!</i>

04:51.914 --> 04:53.230
<i>You're a witch!</i>

04:53.307 --> 04:54.496
<i>I'm not a witch.</i>

04:55.360 --> 04:57.717
Are you kissing me?

04:57.877 --> 04:59.190
Allan.

04:59.401 --> 05:02.415
<i>Anyway,
all that Giles says to them...</i>

05:02.492 --> 05:05.167
<i>More weight. I can take it.</i>

05:05.244 --> 05:06.928
<i>More weight!</i>

05:07.005 --> 05:09.308
<i>Oh, is that the biggest,
heaviest rock you got?</i>

05:09.385 --> 05:11.966
<i>More weight! Ahh!</i>

05:12.043 --> 05:16.287
<i>So, for two days,
Giles Corey is being crushed there.</i>

05:16.364 --> 05:19.873
<i>And it got so bad that
Giles Corey's eyes were</i>

05:19.950 --> 05:23.261
<i>bulging out of his head,
and his tongue was just</i>

05:23.338 --> 05:24.913
<i>outside of his mouth.</i>

05:24.990 --> 05:28.599
Sheriff Corwin has to come
over there and put them back in

05:28.676 --> 05:30.892
<i>with the tip of his cane.
And he's like,</i>

05:30.969 --> 05:34.714
<i>Hey, why don't you
confess to being a witch?</i>

05:34.791 --> 05:36.232
<i>And then Giles is like,</i>

05:36.309 --> 05:39.951
<i>you can kill me now,
but I promise I'd curse you.</i>

05:40.028 --> 05:44.229
<i>I... I curse
you, Sherin Curfwin.</i>

05:44.430 --> 05:46.999
<i>I curse you, Sheriff Corwin.</i>

05:47.431 --> 05:49.896
<i>I curse you... Salem!</i>

05:50.025 --> 05:53.295
<i>And I have the hiccups,
but I curse you</i>

05:53.372 --> 05:54.896
<i>'cause I'm being crushed.</i>

05:54.973 --> 05:56.959
<i>And you'll understand this later.</i>

05:57.062 --> 05:59.748
<i>Sorry. Bye.</i>

06:00.330 --> 06:03.401
<i>Giles Corey's death was
so gruesome,</i>

06:03.478 --> 06:07.612
<i>that it led to the end of
the Salem witch trials.</i>

06:07.689 --> 06:11.603
<i>And then four years
later, Sheriff Corwin died</i>

06:11.680 --> 06:13.496
<i>of a heart attack.</i>

06:13.922 --> 06:16.785
Obviously they can't
trace it back to

06:16.949 --> 06:18.973
you know, the curse, but...

06:19.213 --> 06:21.824
We all know it was the ***curse.

06:22.197 --> 06:24.105
<i>So, in 1978,</i>

06:24.182 --> 06:27.091
<i>Sheriff Robert Cahill
had a heart attack</i>

06:27.168 --> 06:29.401
<i>and was like, uh,
I should do some research</i>

06:29.478 --> 06:33.441
<i>on this curse that was
put on us by Giles.</i>

06:33.708 --> 06:37.435
<i>And he found that every
sheriff in Salem had</i>

06:37.512 --> 06:39.144
<i>a heart attack or a stroke.</i>

06:39.221 --> 06:40.912
<i>And he's like, oh, shit!</i>

06:40.989 --> 06:42.863
<i>That curse was real!</i>

06:42.940 --> 06:45.238
<i>And I was like, that
was a real-ass curse.</i>

06:45.315 --> 06:47.381
<i>So they move the Sheriff's
Department out of...</i>

06:47.458 --> 06:48.550
<i>Salem.</i>

06:48.627 --> 06:50.589
This is one
of the untold stories

06:50.666 --> 06:53.650
of the... you know,
Salem witch trials.

06:53.727 --> 06:55.738
Can I press you
real quick?

06:55.815 --> 06:57.347
I could die.

07:02.370 --> 07:03.769
How's that feel?

07:04.144 --> 07:07.425
- Ugh. I'm paral...
- I'm paralyzed.

07:12.050 --> 07:14.756
Hello. I'm Tess Lynch,

07:14.833 --> 07:19.715
and tonight we're going to learn
about the mother of Halloween.

07:19.939 --> 07:22.980
Mrs. Elizabeth Krebs.

07:24.000 --> 07:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here

07:32.490 --> 07:33.514
Freaking me out.

07:33.591 --> 07:34.926
- You're freaking me out.
- Wow.

07:35.158 --> 07:38.020
<i>In the early decades
of the 20th century,</i>

07:38.097 --> 07:41.347
<i>Halloween was celebrated
in a far different way.</i>

07:41.424 --> 07:45.180
<i>This was 1912 in Hiawatha, Kansas,</i>

07:45.257 --> 07:48.051
<i>and groups of kids
would gather together,</i>

07:48.128 --> 07:50.438
<i>wear masks and they would
just, like, destroy shit.</i>

07:50.515 --> 07:53.734
<i>And they're like, oh,
shoot, an outhouse.</i>

07:53.811 --> 07:55.142
<i>What're we gonna do
to that outhouse?</i>

07:55.219 --> 07:57.219
<i>Tip it the hell over,
yeah, that's right.</i>

07:57.296 --> 07:59.767
<i>And then they would set it on
fire and then they'd laugh.</i>

07:59.844 --> 08:02.728
<i>And then before you know it,
the entire town is just like,</i>

08:02.805 --> 08:05.441
<i>turned-over outhouses,
beheaded chickens,</i>

08:05.518 --> 08:06.873
<i>babies punched in the head.</i>

08:06.950 --> 08:08.465
<i>The kids... 
the hooligans are like,</i>

08:08.543 --> 08:11.900
<i>I'm a... I'm a boy with a penis.
I'm peeing in the hole!</i>

08:11.977 --> 08:14.329
<i>Devil's night, mother***.</i>

08:14.406 --> 08:15.535
That's scary.

08:15.612 --> 08:17.722
It's terrible.
It's just, like...

08:17.799 --> 08:19.009
It's just terrible.

08:19.086 --> 08:22.419
<i>So, on the morning of
November 1st, 1912,</i>

08:22.496 --> 08:24.243
<i>day after Halloween,
obviously,</i>

08:24.320 --> 08:27.981
<i>Elizabeth Krebs, founder of
the Hiawatha Garden Club,</i>

08:28.058 --> 08:30.457
<i>wakes up, parts the curtains,</i>

08:30.600 --> 08:34.543
<i>and saw her garden was
completely up.</i>

08:35.404 --> 08:37.337
<i>And she's like, this is insane!</i>

08:37.414 --> 08:40.010
<i>The heirloom roses...</i>

08:40.095 --> 08:41.953
The asters...

08:42.030 --> 08:44.569
<i>The, like, gourds...</i>

08:44.646 --> 08:47.433
<i>And she's like, what's
wrong with these kids?</i>

08:47.510 --> 08:48.589
<i>What do they need?</i>

08:48.666 --> 08:50.485
<i>You know
what I think they need</i>

08:50.562 --> 08:51.713
<i>is a party.</i>

08:51.790 --> 08:54.613
<i>Burn off that
demon-ous energy.</i>

08:54.690 --> 08:55.726
<i>Is that a word?</i>

08:55.804 --> 08:56.815
Yeah.

08:56.893 --> 08:57.986
Anyway, listen.

08:58.063 --> 09:02.056
<i>October 31st, 1913.
Elizabeth Krebs is like,</i>

09:02.133 --> 09:04.222
<i>I'ma have a... I'm gonna
have a decent-sized party.</i>

09:04.299 --> 09:07.238
<i>Not a big party. Who am I?
The King of Rome? No.</i>

09:07.315 --> 09:08.369
So, she does it.

09:08.447 --> 09:10.463
And then the neighborhood
kids come, they're like,

09:10.541 --> 09:12.807
<i>hey, pretty cool party,
Mrs. Krebs!</i>

09:12.885 --> 09:16.349
<i>Bobbing for apples, like,
I'm MVP of bobbing for apples.</i>

09:16.426 --> 09:19.019
And then it just keeps going,
like, ad nauseam on repeat

09:19.096 --> 09:20.698
until the end of... of the evening.

09:20.775 --> 09:22.033
<i>So, Elizabeth Krebs is like,</i>

09:22.110 --> 09:24.460
<i>I have a feeling this
is really gonna work.</i>

09:24.537 --> 09:28.430
<i>I've exhausted this youthful
population to the point where</i>

09:28.535 --> 09:31.340
<i>they can't do shit.
This is awesome.</i>

09:31.417 --> 09:33.339
<i>So, she goes to bed,</i>

09:33.416 --> 09:36.841
<i>wakes up the next morning,
November 1st, 1913,</i>

09:36.984 --> 09:38.281
<i>parts the curtains...</i>

09:38.358 --> 09:39.757
<i>but everything's leveled again.</i>

09:39.834 --> 09:41.022
<i>And Elizabeth Krebs is like,</i>

09:41.099 --> 09:43.956
<i>no shit!
Are you kidding me?</i>

09:44.451 --> 09:47.245
<i>And look at that. A
mail truck's on fire.</i>

09:47.322 --> 09:48.826
<i>Someone's waiting for
a postcard</i>

09:48.903 --> 09:51.065
<i>that's never gonna arrive
because that mail truck</i>

09:51.142 --> 09:52.352
<i>got lit the ***
on fire.</i>

09:52.429 --> 09:54.751
<i>And she's like,
I had this decent-sized party.</i>

09:54.828 --> 09:56.391
<i>How could these kids
even have it in them</i>

09:56.468 --> 09:57.886
<i>to take a piss on everything?</i>

09:57.963 --> 09:59.563
<i>But then, Elizabeth Krebs is like,</i>

09:59.640 --> 10:01.128
<i>you know what?</i>

10:01.205 --> 10:02.261
<i>I got an idea.</i>

10:02.338 --> 10:03.970
So, she goes home.

10:04.047 --> 10:06.534
And Elizabeth Krebs
spends the entire next year

10:06.611 --> 10:07.813
<i>planning for this party.</i>

10:07.890 --> 10:11.336
<i>And she devoted all of
her own time and resources</i>

10:11.413 --> 10:15.182
<i>and money into making ***
a huge rager.</i>

10:16.230 --> 10:18.065
Oh, I spilled.

10:18.567 --> 10:19.621
Happy Halloween.

10:19.698 --> 10:20.805
And now look...

10:20.882 --> 10:22.597
- for the whole rest of it.
- What happened?

10:22.674 --> 10:25.366
I dribbled, man.
I *** dribbled.

10:25.444 --> 10:26.561
So...

10:26.639 --> 10:31.034
<i>It is October 31st, 1914.
She's waiting at town square.</i>

10:31.111 --> 10:33.657
And eventually...
poof-poof-poof-poof.

10:33.734 --> 10:36.586
<i>What's that?
Kids in costumes</i>

10:36.663 --> 10:40.003
<i>trickling in
to the town square,</i>

10:40.121 --> 10:41.604
<i>ready ***
to rage.</i>

10:41.681 --> 10:43.203
<i>And she's like,
thank God because</i>

10:43.280 --> 10:45.449
<i>I knew this was gonna
be a thing and it was.</i>

10:45.526 --> 10:47.448
<i>So, these kids...
these hooligans</i>

10:47.525 --> 10:50.571
<i>are at this party and band
comes in, starts playing.</i>

10:50.648 --> 10:52.564
<i>♪♪ Too-too-too-too... ♪♪</i>

10:52.730 --> 10:54.254
<i>That's... felt weak sauce.</i>

10:54.431 --> 10:55.605
Was that weak sauce?

10:55.682 --> 10:57.149
- I love that song.
- So, anyway.

10:57.226 --> 10:59.901
<i>The hooligans are like,
hey man, I'm pretty shocked</i>

10:59.978 --> 11:02.422
<i>that old Mrs. Krebs is throwing,
like, ***</i>

11:02.499 --> 11:06.141
<i>the coolest party
I ever seen in Hiawatha, Kansas.</i>

11:06.218 --> 11:08.909
<i>And so,
everybody gets marched down</i>

11:08.986 --> 11:11.368
<i>to the Armstrong opera house.
And Elizabeth Krebs is like,</i>

11:11.445 --> 11:13.237
<i>Yo, that's a long way
and those kids</i>

11:13.314 --> 11:15.618
<i>are gonna be *** tired
by the time they get there.</i>

11:15.695 --> 11:18.039
<i>And they're actually
really enjoying themselves.</i>

11:18.116 --> 11:20.260
<i>And they're like, man,
this is my jam.</i>

11:20.337 --> 11:22.765
<i>This is "Danny Boy."
This is top of the charts.</i>

11:22.842 --> 11:25.081
So, the band keeps
playing, playing, playing

11:25.158 --> 11:27.000
until these kids are, like,
zombified.

11:27.077 --> 11:28.432
<i>It's, like, "Thriller."</i>

11:28.791 --> 11:31.491
<i>And Elizabeth Krebs is like,
that's good. I like that.</i>

11:31.569 --> 11:32.604
<i>I like that.</i>

11:32.681 --> 11:34.108
<i>So, she goes home,
she goes to bed,</i>

11:34.185 --> 11:35.531
<i>wakes up next morning,</i>

11:35.609 --> 11:38.297
<i> November 1st, 1914,
What does she see?</i>

11:38.375 --> 11:39.704
How's her garden looking,
Derek?

11:39.781 --> 11:41.432
I'm not sure.
I'm a little worried

11:41.509 --> 11:42.641
that it's gonna be destroyed.

11:42.718 --> 11:43.766
No.

11:43.844 --> 11:44.891
<i>Phoo.</i>

11:44.969 --> 11:46.805
<i>She looks out. And she's like,</i>

11:46.883 --> 11:49.750
<i>Asters, right there.
Heirloom roses, right there.</i>

11:49.827 --> 11:51.545
<i>And *** gourds, boom.</i>

11:51.622 --> 11:53.393
<i>It's like,
all the shit is lined up.</i>

11:53.470 --> 11:54.789
<i>It's exactly as it should be.</i>

11:54.866 --> 11:56.902
<i>People are in awe of her.
They're like,</i>

11:56.979 --> 11:59.151
<i>Elizabeth,
nobody destroyed my house.</i>

11:59.228 --> 12:00.650
<i>Nobody broke my windows.</i>

12:00.727 --> 12:02.026
<i>Chief of police comes up.</i>

12:02.103 --> 12:04.213
<i>Thank you,
Elizabeth Krebs.</i>

12:04.290 --> 12:05.610
<i>Thank you,
because guess what?</i>

12:05.687 --> 12:08.916
<i>Vandalism reports?
Way down precipitously.</i>

12:08.993 --> 12:11.682
<i>And actually,
nobody was up to anything</i>

12:11.759 --> 12:14.292
<i>other than partying at
your *** rager.</i>

12:14.369 --> 12:16.071
<i>She's like, *** damn straight.</i>

12:16.148 --> 12:18.719
<i>And he's like, we're gonna
keep this tradition rolling</i>

12:18.796 --> 12:19.990
<i>pretty much forever.</i>

12:20.067 --> 12:21.457
<i>She's like, sounds good.</i>

12:21.534 --> 12:26.180
So, it changed the way
we celebrate Halloween here

12:26.257 --> 12:28.286
and everywhere.

12:28.363 --> 12:30.487
<i>That was all because
one woman...</i>

12:30.583 --> 12:34.607
<i>Elizabeth Krebs said,
Halloween is not about</i>

12:34.684 --> 12:37.586
<i>turning over outhouses to
put poo on people's lawns.</i>

12:37.663 --> 12:39.949
<i>It is about
dressing up really cute,</i>

12:40.026 --> 12:41.831
<i>getting a shit-ton of candy.</i>

12:42.072 --> 12:43.495
<i>Booyah.</i>

12:45.959 --> 12:47.810
Oh, shit. This is like...

12:47.887 --> 12:49.284
Real serious makeup.

12:49.361 --> 12:51.520
This is my favorite
Halloween, by the way.

12:51.597 --> 12:53.324
'Cause I've never liked
Halloween.

12:53.401 --> 12:55.125
Me too.
I think you're looking good.

12:55.202 --> 12:58.074
I think I've pretty much
handled it at this point.

12:58.151 --> 13:00.524
I think I pretty
much got to the bottom of it.

13:00.601 --> 13:01.883
Is it all gone?

13:02.004 --> 13:03.362
There we go.

13:03.439 --> 13:05.555
That's really good.
You looking good, dude.

13:05.632 --> 13:07.564
I like it. I like it a lot.

13:12.386 --> 13:15.830
So, this is
premium kosher slivovitz.

13:15.907 --> 13:18.207
The drink from Dracula.

13:23.787 --> 13:27.051
- Yeah. Cheers.
- Mmm.

13:29.974 --> 13:30.974
Mmm.

13:34.260 --> 13:35.675
Hmm?

13:39.532 --> 13:43.590
It's so hard to get in your
mouth with these teeth in.

13:44.340 --> 13:47.762
That went mo... that
went a lot in my nose.

13:48.621 --> 13:49.831
Hello.

13:50.258 --> 13:52.051
I'm Greg Tuculescu.

13:52.422 --> 13:53.949
And today...

13:57.176 --> 13:59.918
Today we're gonna
talk about Vlad the Impaler.

14:00.199 --> 14:02.129
The real man behind...

14:04.268 --> 14:05.479
Dracula.

14:05.841 --> 14:08.910
<i>So, it's 1447,</i>

14:08.987 --> 14:11.837
<i>and Vlad III from Wallachia</i>

14:11.914 --> 14:14.244
<i>is a political prisoner
in the Ottoman Empire.</i>

14:14.321 --> 14:16.487
<i>And Vlad is like,
I wanna go back to my dad.</i>

14:16.564 --> 14:18.205
<i>I'm a prince!
I'm an heir to the throne!</i>

14:18.282 --> 14:20.363
<i>And Radu,
Vlad's brother, is like,</i>

14:20.440 --> 14:21.504
<i>I kinda like it here.</i>

14:21.581 --> 14:23.639
<i>I really like
the salt and sun and Memed II.</i>

14:23.716 --> 14:24.869
<i>And Memed's like,
I like you too.</i>

14:24.946 --> 14:27.235
<i>And then, out of nowhere
this boyar shows up.</i>

14:27.312 --> 14:29.611
<i>This nobleman. And he's
breathless, and he's like, Vlad!</i>

14:29.688 --> 14:31.838
<i>I have bad news.
Your father is dead.</i>

14:32.016 --> 14:34.684
<i>He's dead. He was
killed by rival boyars.</i>

14:35.074 --> 14:36.331
And Vlad is like,

14:36.408 --> 14:38.099
<i>I'd like to avenge
my father's death, please.</i>

14:38.176 --> 14:39.230
<i>Can you please release me?</i>

14:39.308 --> 14:40.799
<i>And they're like, okay.</i>

14:40.876 --> 14:42.734
<i>But Radu's gonna stay
here if that's cool.</i>

14:42.811 --> 14:44.022
<i>And Radu's like,
yeah, I love it here.</i>

14:44.100 --> 14:46.905
<i>So, um,
e rides to Wallachia,</i>

14:46.982 --> 14:49.064
<i>kicks down the door,
and he's like,</i>

14:49.141 --> 14:51.715
<i>you ain't gonna
take away our freedoms.</i>

14:52.853 --> 14:56.188
Ohh. Watch that head.

14:56.265 --> 14:57.248
Oww.

14:57.449 --> 14:59.870
<i>Anyway. He's like, sweet.</i>

14:59.962 --> 15:02.142
<i>I'm pretty much
prince of Wallachia.</i>

15:02.219 --> 15:04.171
<i>Let's have a partaaay!</i>

15:04.248 --> 15:06.636
<i>And he invites all these boyars.</i>

15:06.713 --> 15:09.613
<i>He's like, guys, let's
*** bury the hatchet.</i>

15:09.690 --> 15:11.930
<i>I know you killed my father.
That's fine.</i>

15:12.007 --> 15:13.635
<i>You don't worry...
but don't worry about it.</i>

15:13.712 --> 15:15.241
<i>You killed my dad. That's okay.</i>

15:15.318 --> 15:16.596
<i>So the boyars are like,</i>

15:16.673 --> 15:20.348
<i>we'll *** do whatever
you feel like is good.</i>

15:20.425 --> 15:23.003
They like drink
and have a great time.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.403
<i>Uh...</i>

15:24.756 --> 15:26.815
<i>And then they're gonna
leave, and they're like,</i>

15:26.892 --> 15:29.685
<i>great, thank you so much,
but we had such a great time.</i>

15:29.762 --> 15:30.838
<i>We're gonna head out.</i>

15:30.915 --> 15:33.506
<i>And Vlad's like, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

15:33.583 --> 15:34.781
<i>Shut the doors.</i>

15:35.260 --> 15:36.840
<i>All the boyars are like, wait, what?</i>

15:36.917 --> 15:39.976
<i>So, Vlad's like, you
know what I'm gonna do?</i>

15:40.233 --> 15:43.594
<i>I'm gonna take a stake
that's like sharpened</i>

15:43.671 --> 15:45.770
<i>almost to a point... kind of.</i>

15:45.847 --> 15:47.840
<i>Not to a point. A little rounded.</i>

15:47.917 --> 15:50.441
<i>And I'm gonna shove it up
your butthole.</i>

15:50.518 --> 15:53.223
<i>And then I'm gonna, like,
go into your esophagus,</i>

15:53.300 --> 15:55.423
<i>and then I'm gonna
stick it out your mouth.</i>

15:55.500 --> 15:58.519
<i>I'm going to impale you.</i>

15:58.948 --> 16:02.276
And he does that to 200 boyars.

16:02.849 --> 16:04.089
<i>It's...</i>

16:04.354 --> 16:07.071
<i>It's *** sadistic.</i>

16:07.148 --> 16:10.701
<i>And he impaled 200 boyars.</i>

16:10.801 --> 16:12.784
In his court in...

16:15.602 --> 16:18.870
<i>Vlad is like, call me Dracula.</i>

16:19.272 --> 16:22.964
<i>So, he's, like, going around
doing this to everybody.</i>

16:23.041 --> 16:25.508
<i>He's like, you, you look
like you're an adulterer.</i>

16:25.585 --> 16:27.140
<i>You, you look like
you're lazy.</i>

16:27.217 --> 16:28.993
<i>You, you look like you're a thief!</i>

16:29.070 --> 16:31.011
<i>I'm gonna impale all of you!</i>

16:31.088 --> 16:32.536
<i>And he impales them.</i>

16:32.613 --> 16:35.646
<i>And he burns the whole ***
town to the ground.</i>

16:35.723 --> 16:38.115
<i>And there's a German
monk there and he's like,</i>

16:38.192 --> 16:39.747
<i>oh, mein Gott!</i>

16:39.824 --> 16:44.083
<i>He's dipping his bread
in the blood of his victims!</i>

16:44.160 --> 16:46.379
<i>Und he's eating it!</i>

16:46.456 --> 16:47.656
<i>That's a vampire.</i>

16:47.733 --> 16:50.142
He instorters...
He instorters?

16:50.219 --> 16:52.576
He ins... he...

16:52.653 --> 16:56.512
<i>Instills order in Wallachia.</i>

16:56.660 --> 16:59.387
So, Memed is like,

16:59.464 --> 17:01.853
<i>your brother wants to
be called "Dracula."</i>

17:01.930 --> 17:04.410
<i>And Radu's like, Dracula?</i>

17:04.521 --> 17:07.589
<i>That just means,
like, son of Dracul</i>

17:07.666 --> 17:09.165
<i>which we both are.</i>

17:09.242 --> 17:10.361
<i>That's lame.</i>

17:10.438 --> 17:13.603
<i>And Memed's like,
we should definitely attack Vlad</i>

17:13.680 --> 17:16.598
<i>because Vlad's being a super dick.</i>

17:16.877 --> 17:20.821
<i>So, Memed crosses into Wallachia</i>

17:20.898 --> 17:22.704
<i>with these, like,
60,000 troops</i>

17:22.781 --> 17:24.385
<i>and Dracula's like,</i>

17:24.462 --> 17:25.667
<i>I get it. I'm outnumbered.</i>

17:25.744 --> 17:27.707
<i>So, I'm gonna retreat,</i>

17:27.784 --> 17:29.741
<i>but what I want you guys to do...</i>

17:29.818 --> 17:33.392
<i>my colonels and lieutenants
and generals and shit...</i>

17:33.469 --> 17:36.183
<i>I want you to burn
everything!</i>

17:36.260 --> 17:38.017
<i>And they're like, all right,
but we're, like ***,</i>

17:38.094 --> 17:40.025
<i>up our own land.
And he's like, yes!</i>

17:40.102 --> 17:41.651
<i>Destroy Wallachia...</i>

17:41.728 --> 17:42.724
<i>Vallachia.</i>

17:42.801 --> 17:43.916
<i>So, they do it.</i>

17:43.993 --> 17:46.762
<i>And they up everything.</i>

17:49.113 --> 17:52.389
♪♪ Boo-too-too-too-too... ♪♪

17:52.693 --> 17:56.091
♪♪ Halloween Boowubububu ♪♪

17:57.525 --> 18:00.822
Halloween, baby.

18:00.899 --> 18:01.987
Ooh!

18:02.065 --> 18:03.278
<i>So, anyway...</i>

18:03.355 --> 18:06.652
<i>When Memed comes through,
they come upon a sight</i>

18:06.729 --> 18:09.481
<i>that makes his soldiers
stop in their tracks.</i>

18:09.558 --> 18:12.520
<i>And it is a section
half a mile wide</i>

18:12.597 --> 18:13.978
<i>and two miles long</i>

18:14.055 --> 18:17.261
<i>of over 20,000 Turkish
soldiers and prisoners</i>

18:17.338 --> 18:19.131
<i>- that have been impaled.
- Mm!</i>

18:19.208 --> 18:20.698
<i>And Memed sees it
and he's like,</i>

18:20.775 --> 18:23.642
<i>Jesus!
I don't even believe in Jesus.</i>

18:23.719 --> 18:26.263
<i>Holy boly Allah, holy Muhammad.</i>

18:26.340 --> 18:28.201
<i>It's like a forest of the impaled.</i>

18:28.278 --> 18:29.855
<i>And he's like, you know what, guys?</i>

18:29.932 --> 18:31.177
<i>Let's turn around.</i>

18:31.254 --> 18:32.800
<i>And they just
turned around and left.</i>

18:32.877 --> 18:34.757
<i>So, Vlad has won.</i>

18:34.834 --> 18:37.267
<i>He's like,
Ha, haa! Yay!</i>

18:37.344 --> 18:39.883
He was arguably the
most sadistic liver...

18:39.960 --> 18:41.111
L...

18:41.189 --> 18:43.433
He was arguably the
most sadi... distic..

18:43.510 --> 18:47.567
The most sadistic ruler
that ever lived.

18:47.644 --> 18:49.570
<i>But then, Radu is like,</i>

18:49.647 --> 18:51.376
<i>Mmm, hold on a second.</i>

18:51.453 --> 18:54.795
<i>Uh, people of Wallachia?
Mm, Vlad is... sucks.</i>

18:54.872 --> 18:56.392
<i>He's, like,
a piece of shit, right?</i>

18:56.469 --> 18:58.691
<i>So, like,
why don't you support me?</i>

18:58.768 --> 18:59.849
<i>I'm a good guy.</i>

18:59.926 --> 19:03.038
<i>And they kick Vlad
Dracula out of Wallachia.</i>

19:03.115 --> 19:04.842
<i>Vlad's like...</i>

19:05.793 --> 19:08.388
<i>So, fast forward 12 years.</i>

19:08.465 --> 19:10.863
<i>Vlad is, like, fighting
some, like, border skirmish</i>

19:10.940 --> 19:13.570
<i>or something. And then,
this Turkish assassin, like,</i>

19:13.647 --> 19:15.178
<i>shoots him with an arrow...</i>

19:15.344 --> 19:18.574
<i>And he goes to Vlad,
and then he kills him.</i>

19:18.651 --> 19:21.475
<i>And chops off his head!</i>

19:21.552 --> 19:23.627
<i>And he takes the head back to Memed.</i>

19:23.918 --> 19:27.190
<i>And Memed is like, cool.</i>

19:27.356 --> 19:29.228
<i>I'm gonna put it on a stake.</i>

19:29.305 --> 19:31.463
<i>'Cause he loved to impale people.</i>

19:34.039 --> 19:35.173
<i>And Vlad's like,</i>

19:35.915 --> 19:37.721
<i>Whatever.
I don't even feel this.</i>

19:37.798 --> 19:41.051
<i>I'm already dead.
Joke's on you guys.</i>

19:45.793 --> 19:47.471
My head's on a stake.

19:47.548 --> 19:50.155
<i>Look at my face, people!</i>

19:50.232 --> 19:52.504
<i>Look at my face, mother.</i>

19:58.065 --> 20:04.052
Ohhhhhhh, my God.
I'm spinning really badly.

20:04.129 --> 20:07.725
<i>So, 400 years later,
Bram Stoker was like,</i>

20:07.802 --> 20:10.809
<i>huh, this is interesting.
This like, legend of vampires.</i>

20:10.886 --> 20:12.550
<i>Maybe I can write
a story about this.</i>

20:12.627 --> 20:16.614
<i>And it became one of the
biggest horror classics ever.</i>

20:16.714 --> 20:17.869
<i>It still is.</i>

20:17.946 --> 20:19.636
Yeah. I mean, like, think about...

20:19.735 --> 20:21.654
Who doesn't know
who Dracula is?

20:21.731 --> 20:23.476
Everybody knows *** Dracula.

20:23.553 --> 20:27.259
- Everyone knows that vampire story.
- There's cereal named after him.

20:27.383 --> 20:29.556
Yeah! Right?
Count Chocula.

20:29.633 --> 20:31.048
- Mm-hmm.
- Not Count Dracula.

20:31.125 --> 20:32.491
- Yeah, right?
- Count Chocula.

20:32.568 --> 20:34.466
It's not Count Dracula.

20:35.758 --> 20:38.720
'Cause there's chocolate
sugar pieces in it!
