19:48.330 --> 19:49.130
Hello.

19:53.210 --> 19:54.810
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

19:54.890 --> 19:57.010
Listen! Children are asleep.
So, let's be quiet.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.050
Thank you very much.

20:05.970 --> 20:07.130
Thank you very much.

20:07.810 --> 20:09.970
This is not much.

20:11.130 --> 20:12.410
Thank you very much.

20:15.810 --> 20:17.490
- Please, have some food.
- Thank you very much.

20:36.410 --> 20:37.410
Try this one.

20:44.210 --> 20:44.770
Is it good?

20:45.690 --> 20:46.810
It is good, isn't it?

20:47.210 --> 20:47.850
Is it good?

20:48.690 --> 20:50.490
- It is good.
- It is good.

20:50.970 --> 20:51.810
It is good.

21:02.890 --> 21:03.690
Well...

21:04.810 --> 21:05.890
Actually...

21:06.810 --> 21:09.050
It is hard to talk about those things.

21:09.330 --> 21:11.050
It is not just about us.

21:19.090 --> 21:21.250
Akiko is our eldest.

21:23.330 --> 21:26.570
They have tried to tell us...

21:27.290 --> 21:28.770
that what she has is cerebral palsy,

21:29.210 --> 21:30.490
but we knew better

21:36.490 --> 21:38.490
She was born ill and she still is.

21:40.890 --> 21:42.210
She will never get better.

21:45.250 --> 21:48.170
But our family bonds are strong.

21:50.050 --> 21:52.690
Akiko is... our treasure.

22:03.610 --> 22:06.010
We have six children,

22:06.490 --> 22:08.970
and we all work hard
to take care of Akiko.

22:09.690 --> 22:13.410
It takes five hours a day to feed her,

22:13.770 --> 22:17.130
but she brings us closer as a family.

22:18.890 --> 22:20.970
When you meet her, you'll see.

22:21.290 --> 22:24.410
She is a beautiful soul.

22:33.650 --> 22:38.570
We don't want to bring attention
to our family...

22:39.090 --> 22:41.330
but we don't have a choice.

22:43.730 --> 22:47.010
I drive a truck for Chisso.

22:47.210 --> 22:48.290
For Chisso!

22:49.770 --> 22:54.770
But it's not enough to take care
of a family with the needs we have.

23:38.570 --> 23:42.210
- We thank you for your kindness.
- Not at all.

23:44.170 --> 23:46.170
If you don't mind...

23:46.490 --> 23:51.090
Can we take some photos
of Akiko tomorrow?

23:52.850 --> 23:54.210
Well really, that kind of thing...

23:54.890 --> 23:56.170
...you'll have to excuse us

23:56.410 --> 23:57.570
I'm sorry. No.

23:59.210 --> 24:00.250
I'm sorry.

24:04.490 --> 24:07.290
- I will make your beds.
- Thank you.

24:18.330 --> 24:22.890
- Please! There's nothing much left but...
- Thank you.

25:05.410 --> 25:07.130
Excuse me! Excuse me!

25:08.730 --> 25:11.170
He seems that he cannot fall asleep.

25:11.810 --> 25:13.650
Do you have anything to drink?

25:14.170 --> 25:16.450
A drink?
Just one minute.

25:23.050 --> 25:26.050
- He loves whiskey for sure.
- Probably.

25:26.250 --> 25:27.050
Whiskey.

25:28.770 --> 25:30.130
- Good.
- Good.

25:31.210 --> 25:33.050
- Good night.
- Good night.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.330
Last night I rode my bicycle
all the way up to Tsunagi...

30:46.970 --> 30:50.250
...because I heard about one family.

30:50.850 --> 30:54.850
At first, they didn't want to let me in.

30:56.410 --> 30:59.250
I asked them why...

30:59.370 --> 31:02.930
they haven't been seen
in the neighbourhood lately.

31:04.490 --> 31:09.570
I could see the shame on their faces.

31:10.890 --> 31:15.010
It turns out their young boy
was very sick with Minamata disease.

31:16.890 --> 31:20.490
I asked them to join us,
that we wanted help.

31:21.730 --> 31:26.370
They considered but ultimately
their shame won out and they declined.

31:26.570 --> 31:31.490
They love their son just as they should.

31:35.010 --> 31:39.090
In all cases of Minamata,
there is someone to blame.

31:39.570 --> 31:41.690
The suffering is caused by an evil...

31:43.650 --> 31:45.570
...that we know as a fact!

31:47.290 --> 31:48.410
So, here we are.

31:49.250 --> 31:52.690
We have a choice.

31:53.010 --> 31:56.090
We can let the world know.

31:56.410 --> 32:01.330
If we are loud enough, they will listen.

32:03.970 --> 32:05.730
Accept your responsibility!

32:06.290 --> 32:07.610
Come on.

32:08.570 --> 32:09.850
Accept your responsibility!

32:44.770 --> 32:46.610
Is he alone?

32:47.370 --> 32:49.610
I think so.

39:02.650 --> 39:05.730
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

39:26.010 --> 39:26.690
Is this yours?

39:35.370 --> 39:37.890
How do we turn it to photos?

39:58.410 --> 40:01.490
Aren't you afraid of touching me?

41:19.530 --> 41:20.490
Thank you.

41:22.570 --> 41:23.530
Thank you.

42:32.330 --> 42:33.170
This way.

42:33.970 --> 42:36.450
Put your stuff here.

42:42.250 --> 42:43.450
It's for my aunt.

44:52.850 --> 44:54.170
Thank you very much.

50:01.130 --> 50:04.410
If human beings are still
the masters of creation...

50:04.730 --> 50:07.850
we have to overthrow this poisoned world.

50:08.570 --> 50:09.970
Is this civilisation?

50:10.410 --> 50:14.250
Is this the so-called
period of rapid growth?

50:14.810 --> 50:18.170
But done at the cost
of sacrificing countless lives?

50:19.090 --> 50:21.090
Our beautiful blue ocean is now made
into a deadly sea by those people.

50:22.610 --> 50:26.490
So, if you are a human being,
please stand up...

50:27.170 --> 50:28.570
and fight!

50:29.090 --> 50:32.330
Remember, we never wanted a war.

50:32.850 --> 50:35.410
But we have to fight.

50:36.050 --> 50:39.570
Let's make this the last battle for humanity.

50:40.490 --> 50:41.850
Please stand up!

50:43.530 --> 50:44.330
Go! Go!

50:45.930 --> 50:47.210
What are you doing?

57:17.250 --> 57:19.330
Chisso is winning back
the support of the people...

57:19.490 --> 57:22.810
because we're influencing
student activists...

57:22.970 --> 57:25.650
who are acting violently
against Chisso personnel.

57:26.450 --> 57:29.730
This is not who we are.

57:30.050 --> 57:32.210
Chisso are the ones acting violently.

57:32.530 --> 57:34.850
We need to stay together on this
or we'll lose.

57:35.210 --> 57:36.730
You know we'll lose!

57:36.850 --> 57:39.410
We've offered good terms.

57:39.570 --> 57:43.170
Chisso are promising
compensation will be quick.

57:44.090 --> 57:46.610
We don't want
any more fighting in the town...

57:46.810 --> 57:49.370
or shame brought to Minamata.

57:49.450 --> 57:51.530
Chisso is behind this.

57:52.090 --> 57:53.690
You are blind to it.

57:53.810 --> 57:55.210
That's not true!

57:55.450 --> 57:58.130
Is your goal to have Chisso
move somewhere else?

57:58.610 --> 58:00.650
That's what they'll do
and where will our town be then?

58:01.290 --> 58:03.010
This is not just about this town.

58:04.010 --> 58:05.530
It's about big companies all over the world

58:06.050 --> 58:08.730
invading the towns of
good, hard-working people,

58:09.410 --> 58:11.090
and polluting their existence.

58:11.410 --> 58:12.890
It's happened before...

58:13.570 --> 58:15.490
and it will happen again!

58:16.050 --> 58:17.210
Don't get so emotional!

58:19.410 --> 58:20.850
Calm down!

58:22.410 --> 58:23.730
Don't cause any trouble.

58:24.650 --> 58:26.530
We understand how you feel.

58:27.090 --> 58:29.690
We are all in the same pain.

58:30.690 --> 58:33.250
But we all want it to end.

58:34.250 --> 58:38.130
The signatures speak for themselves.

58:38.970 --> 58:40.490
The people have spoken!

58:41.010 --> 58:43.770
This is the right way
to settle the matter...

58:44.050 --> 58:45.330
for all.

58:45.530 --> 58:47.050
No more fighting!

58:47.490 --> 58:51.010
May we see the book?

58:52.370 --> 58:54.050
That's not necessary.

58:55.170 --> 58:56.890
Have you pressed your signature
on this document?

58:57.250 --> 58:58.050
No.

58:58.450 --> 58:59.450
And you?

59:01.490 --> 59:02.850
And you?

59:05.970 --> 59:09.650
They have overwhelming
signatures of support in the book...

59:10.410 --> 59:11.890
yet they won't show it.

59:13.290 --> 59:15.530
Do we believe this is fair?

59:15.890 --> 59:17.930
Let us see the book!

59:18.250 --> 59:20.770
Show us! Show us!

59:27.290 --> 59:30.250
That's my signature. I never pressed it!

59:30.930 --> 59:34.370
That guy is dead. How could he have signed?

59:34.770 --> 59:36.770
You're right. He is dead!

59:37.010 --> 59:38.250
What's going on here?

59:38.690 --> 59:39.770
Tell us!

59:40.010 --> 59:41.490
You're full of lies!

59:58.330 --> 59:59.130
Hello.

59:59.690 --> 1:00:01.610
- Welcome.
- Sorry for the intrusion.

1:00:05.570 --> 1:00:06.690
Excuse us.

1:00:10.890 --> 1:00:12.050
Hello.

1:00:12.770 --> 1:00:13.850
Hello.

1:00:17.370 --> 1:00:18.330
Thank you.

1:00:20.970 --> 1:00:22.330
Let's eat together.

1:00:31.050 --> 1:00:32.010
Good, right?

1:00:58.090 --> 1:01:01.130
Mr. Eugene, are you married?

1:01:01.690 --> 1:01:03.330
He has two children.

1:01:04.730 --> 1:01:06.410
Does he have photos of them?

1:01:23.690 --> 1:01:26.010
Unfortunately, he hasn't got any photos of them.

1:02:05.570 --> 1:02:06.450
Let's go.

1:02:10.010 --> 1:02:12.970
I'll go out for a while.
Don't get worried.

1:02:14.130 --> 1:02:17.050
I'll give you a bath soon, Akiko.

1:03:44.170 --> 1:03:45.410
You're a good girl.

1:03:53.570 --> 1:03:55.890
That way, we can't interfere.

1:03:58.210 --> 1:04:00.250
- You are Yamazaki Mitsuo, right?
- We will search the place.

1:04:00.330 --> 1:04:00.810
What?

1:04:00.850 --> 1:04:02.930
- Get the children inside.
- Don't get in our way.

1:04:04.050 --> 1:04:04.850
Go. Go.

1:04:10.090 --> 1:04:10.850
Don't take photos!

1:04:11.170 --> 1:04:12.170
Don't resist!

1:04:13.570 --> 1:04:14.570
Don't resist!

1:04:22.850 --> 1:04:24.810
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

1:04:28.090 --> 1:04:30.450
Papa!

1:04:31.290 --> 1:04:32.490
They're gone.

1:04:33.010 --> 1:04:35.450
Papa!

1:04:35.570 --> 1:04:36.610
Everything is okay.

1:04:36.970 --> 1:04:39.530
Mama!

1:04:40.410 --> 1:04:42.450
Papa!

1:04:42.650 --> 1:04:43.450
Mama!

1:04:44.370 --> 1:04:45.810
Mama!

1:10:25.650 --> 1:10:26.810
Bring water.

1:15:55.610 --> 1:15:56.330
Shigro.

1:16:37.170 --> 1:16:41.410
Some people may come and go
with the best of intentions...

1:16:42.010 --> 1:16:44.450
but we can't count on them.

1:16:44.770 --> 1:16:46.370
This is our fight.

1:16:47.530 --> 1:16:49.290
Why do you think Chisso are hitting us...

1:16:50.130 --> 1:16:53.890
harder and harder?

1:16:54.530 --> 1:16:57.610
Why do you think they're getting
bolder and bolder?

1:17:00.290 --> 1:17:01.410
You know why.

1:17:03.090 --> 1:17:05.850
They can threaten us...

1:17:07.050 --> 1:17:09.850
but we are going
to the shareholders meeting...

1:17:21.250 --> 1:17:22.570
Hello.

1:17:25.850 --> 1:17:28.290
I'm not good at public speaking.

1:17:34.810 --> 1:17:39.650
I believe that a picture
worths a thousand words.

1:17:52.410 --> 1:17:56.810
I want to help you,
but I need your help too.

1:18:04.890 --> 1:18:10.250
I want to spend some
precious time with your families.

1:18:16.370 --> 1:18:17.730
If I did this,

1:18:18.610 --> 1:18:20.130
I will be able to help you

1:18:21.410 --> 1:18:22.810
to win your fight.

1:18:54.770 --> 1:18:59.970
Does anyone agree to be photographed?

1:19:36.570 --> 1:19:37.890
Thank you.

1:19:41.890 --> 1:19:43.250
Are you drunk?

1:22:52.330 --> 1:22:54.650
You are murderers!

1:23:26.250 --> 1:23:27.850
How many people are outside?

1:23:28.170 --> 1:23:29.890
Over 500.

1:23:30.090 --> 1:23:31.170
500?

1:23:31.330 --> 1:23:32.050
Yes.

1:25:21.810 --> 1:25:22.850
Mr. President.

1:25:23.450 --> 1:25:26.570
We know there is verdict
that will arrive soon.

1:25:27.690 --> 1:25:33.290
We hope that Chisso will accept
responsibility for its negligence.

1:25:34.410 --> 1:25:38.650
We are not here for luxuries.

1:25:40.170 --> 1:25:42.130
Just to know that we will be looked after

1:25:43.290 --> 1:25:45.050
and able to die in peace.

1:25:46.170 --> 1:25:50.530
If you are human,
listen to what we are saying.

1:26:00.290 --> 1:26:03.090
I and Sadae Ogata.

1:26:04.490 --> 1:26:06.130
I understand that you don't know who I am.

1:26:07.210 --> 1:26:09.450
But you should.

1:26:10.850 --> 1:26:14.490
Both of my daughters fell ill.

1:26:14.770 --> 1:26:19.450
Both suffered more than I can imagine
anyone suffering, let alone a child.

1:26:21.810 --> 1:26:25.570
My eldest daughter suffered
from convulsions for months.

1:26:27.450 --> 1:26:31.090
So much pain that she couldn't cry.

1:26:34.570 --> 1:26:35.810
She is dead now.

1:26:38.330 --> 1:26:40.410
And my other daughter, Miyuki...

1:26:41.410 --> 1:26:46.890
will never be able
to spend a day without care.

1:26:49.970 --> 1:26:52.890
My husband and I cry often.

1:26:56.970 --> 1:27:02.770
We weep because we fear
for what will happen...

1:27:03.530 --> 1:27:09.050
when we are no longer able...

1:27:09.570 --> 1:27:10.850
to take care of her.

1:27:21.250 --> 1:27:22.410
Mr. President...

1:27:26.010 --> 1:27:27.490
You've got nothing to say?

1:27:31.290 --> 1:27:32.770
You are a human being too, right?

1:27:35.250 --> 1:27:36.410
We are the same, and yet...

1:27:36.930 --> 1:27:38.730
how can we be this different?

1:27:39.770 --> 1:27:40.930
How can we?

1:27:50.450 --> 1:27:52.970
I am sorry. I truly am.

1:28:19.130 --> 1:28:20.570
What happened to you...

1:28:21.130 --> 1:28:22.610
What you have gone through...

1:28:23.330 --> 1:28:25.290
brings sorrow in our hearts.

1:28:26.490 --> 1:28:27.330
Please forgive us.

1:28:45.450 --> 1:28:47.170
My child also has Minamata disease.

1:28:48.690 --> 1:28:50.050
He is nine years old.

1:28:51.370 --> 1:28:53.050
I work on the boats still...

1:28:54.730 --> 1:28:56.650
when the fishermen allow me to...

1:28:58.370 --> 1:28:59.690
but because of my symptoms...

1:29:00.690 --> 1:29:02.250
they don't want me on their boats.

1:29:03.650 --> 1:29:06.850
So, it's my wife that needs to work.

1:29:08.570 --> 1:29:11.450
She works on the boats sometimes...

1:29:11.930 --> 1:29:14.130
and many nights she is forced
to take care of both of us.

1:29:17.010 --> 1:29:19.370
She can't do that forever.

1:29:22.370 --> 1:29:23.490
Can she?

1:29:27.330 --> 1:29:28.490
Mr. President.

1:29:30.370 --> 1:29:33.810
We know that you will pay
for the old victims...

1:29:35.810 --> 1:29:39.370
but you must pay the same
for the new victims as well.

1:29:39.610 --> 1:29:41.330
It's your responsibility!

1:29:43.770 --> 1:29:45.010
Am I wrong?

1:29:51.890 --> 1:29:53.770
Mr. Uyishi, can I have a moment?

1:30:57.450 --> 1:31:01.810
Thank you all for coming
and speaking with me.

1:31:04.850 --> 1:31:07.970
Your plight brings me much sadness.

1:31:18.050 --> 1:31:21.890
But we've added up
the costs of your demands...

1:31:22.410 --> 1:31:25.290
- However...
- We simply cannot pay.

1:31:25.730 --> 1:31:28.810
Unfortunately... this is our final answer.

1:31:30.170 --> 1:31:31.810
I can't take this anymore!

1:31:33.090 --> 1:31:34.770
Kyushi! Kyushi!

1:31:35.090 --> 1:31:37.530
They don't believe we're in pain.

1:31:45.290 --> 1:31:47.250
This blood is on your hands!

1:31:53.610 --> 1:31:54.410
Kyushi!

1:31:59.850 --> 1:32:01.850
Are you okay?

1:33:31.050 --> 1:33:33.250
Can I move Akiko's legs?

1:33:43.850 --> 1:33:44.810
Excuse me.

1:33:50.890 --> 1:33:53.130
Can I move Akiko's left hand?

1:33:53.730 --> 1:33:54.290
Yes.

1:33:55.010 --> 1:33:57.250
Akiko, I will move your hand

1:39:27.330 --> 1:39:28.850
We have to pay.

1:39:30.570 --> 1:39:32.650
Somehow we will find a way.

1:39:56.690 --> 1:39:57.810
We must.

1:40:15.770 --> 1:40:16.850
We won!

1:40:26.610 --> 1:40:29.410
Today, we have won the battle.

1:40:30.490 --> 1:40:33.530
But the war persists.

1:40:34.450 --> 1:40:36.410
We must continue to fight.

1:40:37.770 --> 1:40:40.890
To fight for our children...

1:40:41.810 --> 1:40:47.090
so their children have something...

1:40:47.410 --> 1:40:49.450
that they can fight for.

1:40:50.450 --> 1:40:54.210
But all of you here...

1:40:54.610 --> 1:40:57.010
and the people who stood with us...

1:40:57.770 --> 1:41:01.410
have taught me that this a fight

1:41:02.930 --> 1:41:04.290
we can win!

1:41:09.170 --> 1:41:12.370
Go home tonight

1:41:14.170 --> 1:41:17.530
and find some happiness with your families.

1:41:17.930 --> 1:41:23.050
Because tomorrow we have more to do.

1:41:24.010 --> 1:41:28.330
To fight for those that cannot.
