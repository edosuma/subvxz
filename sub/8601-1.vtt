01:51.399 --> 01:52.399
Isabel!

01:53.360 --> 01:54.360
How are you?

01:55.360 --> 01:57.693
I'm fine. A little tired, but fine.

02:02.799 --> 02:03.799
We're leaving.

02:04.799 --> 02:05.932
Huh? Why?

02:06.066 --> 02:07.066
Seriously?

02:07.799 --> 02:11.209
I'm not playing, come on.
We gotta go, we gotta go.

02:22.760 --> 02:23.760
Manuel, Manuel.

02:26.160 --> 02:29.093
- What's up?
-Please stay, dance and drink.

02:30.920 --> 02:31.920
I'll be fine.

02:32.333 --> 02:33.333
Rocky!

02:34.300 --> 02:35.833
How you doing, brother?

02:36.766 --> 02:37.766
What's up?

02:39.799 --> 02:40.999
Don't tell me, no.

02:41.933 --> 02:44.600
You don't recognize me?
It's me, Naldo!

02:44.833 --> 02:46.300
- Naldo.
- Naldo who?

02:47.200 --> 02:48.400
Naldo Ruiz. Naldo!

02:50.999 --> 02:52.142
How long were you in prison for?

02:52.166 --> 02:53.766
Too long, man!

02:53.899 --> 02:54.875
I really wanna know, all right.

02:54.899 --> 02:55.842
Three years, man.

02:55.866 --> 02:56.866
Three years?

02:57.300 --> 02:59.233
- Whoo! Damn!
- Three years.

03:01.499 --> 03:03.442
Oh, yeah, sorry about
the detective, man...

03:03.466 --> 03:07.199
Hey, drop it. That ain't really
up for discussion, man.

03:08.899 --> 03:10.809
That's your brother José's wife?

03:10.833 --> 03:12.166
- Uh-huh.
- Ah, OK.

03:13.033 --> 03:16.300
- Nice to meet you. Naldo.
- Isabel... Likewise.

03:17.033 --> 03:20.136
- Let me get you a taxi.
- No, Manuel, Manuel...

03:20.160 --> 03:23.176
Look, I'm taking the subway.
I'll go on my own, don't worry.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.416
She's gone already.

03:24.440 --> 03:28.173
Nice to meet you, Yesenia.
Don't keep him out too late.

03:29.833 --> 03:30.875
Hey, yo, my nigga,
I'm gonna walk her

03:30.899 --> 03:31.942
down to the train station
real quick.

03:31.966 --> 03:33.108
I'm gonna holla at you.

03:33.132 --> 03:35.599
Meet me back in the club,
all right?

03:43.400 --> 03:47.000
And so... sister-in-law...
Do you like my girlfriend?

03:48.866 --> 03:49.866
Mm-hmm.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.216
Uh-huh?

03:52.240 --> 03:53.240
She's cute.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.200
And what else?
I know that much.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.147
She's very, very cute.

04:00.960 --> 04:05.160
- So you think you're funny.
-She must learn to speak Spanish.

04:05.466 --> 04:08.909
Isabel, and I bet you could
learn to speak English, too.

04:08.933 --> 04:11.533
- Go home and go take it easy.
- Ciao.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.975
- Send me a text when you get home.
-Okay.

04:16.999 --> 04:17.999
OK.

04:22.933 --> 04:23.933
Isabel!

06:53.265 --> 06:55.065
Thank you. Thank you.

07:19.960 --> 07:20.960
Damn it.

10:12.299 --> 10:13.299
Scotty!

10:13.932 --> 10:14.932
Scotty!

10:22.032 --> 10:23.775
Is he still here?
I want to see him.

10:23.799 --> 10:24.799
Janine, no.

10:25.432 --> 10:26.432
What happened?

10:27.099 --> 10:29.709
Nobody's telling me anything.
What happened to Joey, Scotty?

10:29.733 --> 10:32.742
- What happened to my husband?
- We don't know.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.709
We want you
to be with the kids, OK?

10:34.733 --> 10:36.475
Hug them,
tell them it's gonna be OK.

10:36.499 --> 10:38.742
We'll get someone
to drive you back, OK?

10:38.766 --> 10:40.033
- OK...
- Johnson!

10:50.120 --> 10:54.387
I believe in God, Father Almighty,
creator of heaven and earth.

10:55.080 --> 10:59.480
I believe in Jesus Christ, His son,
conceived by the Holy Spirit.

11:00.600 --> 11:04.856
Born from the Virgin Mary,
suffered under the rule of Pontius Pilate,

11:04.880 --> 11:07.213
was crucified, died and was buried.

11:07.240 --> 11:11.107
He descended into hell.
On the third day, he resurrected.

11:11.600 --> 11:15.056
He went up to heaven
and sits at the right hand of God.

11:15.080 --> 11:18.347
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

11:18.960 --> 11:21.696
...now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

11:21.720 --> 11:22.720
Amen.

11:23.466 --> 11:24.466
Marisol?

11:26.320 --> 11:30.187
We are thankful that little Manuel
is home again with us.

11:31.080 --> 11:33.813
We recite this Rosary
for our dear José.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.720
Please God, keep him safe in Iraq...

11:37.800 --> 11:40.733
...and bring him back to us
safe and sound.

12:07.499 --> 12:10.032
- Sorry about your partner.
- Thanks.

12:11.132 --> 12:12.132
Close the door.

12:18.765 --> 12:22.432
Charlene wants you to
come by this week... for dinner.

12:23.399 --> 12:24.399
OK?

12:24.998 --> 12:25.998
Sure.

12:32.299 --> 12:33.299
Bring Anthony.

12:34.832 --> 12:37.874
He's staying with my sister
for a little while.

12:37.898 --> 12:39.831
Yeah? Well, when he gets back

12:40.832 --> 12:43.699
we gotta get on the boat,
do some fishing.

12:45.499 --> 12:46.499
Yeah.

12:47.065 --> 12:50.198
Yeah... Charlene's
a little worried about you.

12:54.798 --> 12:55.998
Tell her I'm fine.

12:56.798 --> 12:57.798
Really?

12:58.732 --> 13:01.075
- Yeah.
- Your partner was just killed.

13:01.099 --> 13:02.166
You're not fine.

13:06.032 --> 13:07.965
I wanna put you with Ramirez.

13:08.099 --> 13:10.008
I don't want you working
on this case alone.

13:10.032 --> 13:12.108
And frankly, I don't want you
working on this case at all, but...

13:12.132 --> 13:13.132
It's fine.

13:17.765 --> 13:19.098
So, what do we know?

13:21.199 --> 13:22.999
Not fucking much.

13:25.065 --> 13:27.332
What, didn't you
talk to someone?

13:27.765 --> 13:30.365
Yeah, Joey's informant,
Kendu Wallace.

13:35.265 --> 13:36.465
I don't know shit!

13:37.031 --> 13:38.774
I don't know shit!
I'm telling you the truth!

13:38.798 --> 13:40.465
Shh...
Don't scream, OK?

13:41.466 --> 13:44.133
Just be honest.
You were Joey's snitch.

13:44.466 --> 13:46.866
Who killed Joey?
Tell me the truth.

13:47.165 --> 13:49.175
I don't know shit, man!
I'm telling you the truth!

13:49.199 --> 13:51.041
I'm not fucking lyin' to you!

13:51.065 --> 13:52.798
I... I don't know nothing.

13:54.898 --> 13:56.965
I don't know who killed Cullen.

14:08.865 --> 14:11.932
You could say
we had a conversation.

14:13.832 --> 14:14.832
He knew squat.

14:16.265 --> 14:19.332
Well... why the hell
you talking to him then?

14:20.832 --> 14:23.941
There was a crew over in Harlem
that Joey had his eyes on.

14:23.965 --> 14:24.965
In Harlem?

14:25.132 --> 14:27.732
What the fuck
is Joey doing in Harlem?

14:28.065 --> 14:29.198
He was suspended.

14:30.932 --> 14:31.932
I don't know.

14:34.798 --> 14:38.131
When we, uh... We found
his camera near his body.

14:40.998 --> 14:41.998
How's his wife?

14:44.032 --> 14:45.499
She's... not too good.

14:48.299 --> 14:51.808
I'm taking her to the
coroner's office to ID the body.

14:51.832 --> 14:53.032
That poor bastard!

14:53.960 --> 14:57.693
What else could I ask for?
Got my four favorite ladies.

15:00.760 --> 15:02.896
You won't believe
what happened last night.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.453
The most amazing thing.

15:05.160 --> 15:08.160
No, me first.
I've been waiting to tell you.

15:08.720 --> 15:11.987
- No, you go first.
-No, you first. Look at you.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.480
Where's your ring?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.656
It keeps falling off.
It's probably in my bag.

15:16.680 --> 15:20.347
- José should fix that already.
-Yeah, right. Tell me.

15:20.560 --> 15:22.627
I think Hector's gonna propose.

15:22.800 --> 15:23.800
- No.
-Yes!

15:25.440 --> 15:27.176
- You're my maid of honor?
-Yes!

15:27.200 --> 15:28.200
Yes?

15:31.932 --> 15:33.732
Hey, I want to scream, too!

15:34.332 --> 15:35.336
- No.
- What's up?

15:35.360 --> 15:36.760
- No, don't tell him.

15:37.400 --> 15:40.016
- Can't tell you.
-You're not telling me?

15:40.040 --> 15:41.040
She's the boss.

15:42.640 --> 15:43.640
Finally!

15:43.765 --> 15:47.098
They killed him, Scotty!
They fucking killed him!

15:47.165 --> 15:48.898
I mean, who would do that?

15:50.498 --> 15:53.808
They said that when they found him,
he still had the knife in his back!

15:53.832 --> 15:55.741
Who would do
such a thing to him?

15:55.765 --> 15:58.708
They stabbed him
in the back and then they...

15:58.732 --> 16:02.065
they threw him away
like he was a piece of trash.

16:03.965 --> 16:05.232
They butchered him.

17:16.065 --> 17:17.998
Oh, come on, are you serious?

17:18.464 --> 17:19.732
Yo, don't say that!

17:20.765 --> 17:24.056
Stuff like that really
be happening. I'm serious!

17:24.079 --> 17:26.547
I'm not talking about zombies, but...

17:26.680 --> 17:29.013
...Don't laugh at Isabel!
Respect!

17:29.720 --> 17:31.474
Ma, I'm not laughing at her.

17:31.498 --> 17:32.965
I'm laughing at y'all.

17:32.998 --> 17:34.474
Look at your faces
for believing this shit.

17:34.498 --> 17:35.474
Shut up!

17:35.498 --> 17:36.498
Here you go.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.133
What did he say to you?

17:38.920 --> 17:40.453
He didn't say anything.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.408
He stood there, motionless.

17:44.432 --> 17:45.432
In the air?

17:50.798 --> 17:53.465
He shouldn't
work with the devil.

17:53.680 --> 17:56.013
Why not?
Why shouldn't he do that?

17:57.960 --> 18:01.160
The devil is very, very bad
and could kill him.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.400
That's right.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.293
Elisa, are you okay?

18:09.998 --> 18:10.176
Elisa?

18:10.200 --> 18:11.200
Elisa?

18:17.040 --> 18:18.040
Are you okay?

18:18.560 --> 18:21.627
I'm looking for something,
but can't find it.

18:22.080 --> 18:23.747
What are you looking for?

18:23.840 --> 18:25.976
Tell me, what are you looking for?

18:26.000 --> 18:28.216
Tell me, what are you looking for?

18:28.240 --> 18:30.173
- Tell me.
-My little horse.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.693
But I can't find it.

19:34.165 --> 19:35.165
Sir...

19:36.765 --> 19:39.632
Do you know where
I can find one of these?

19:40.960 --> 19:43.827
Do you know where I can find
one of these?

19:51.160 --> 19:53.760
There's a little store
down the block.

19:59.280 --> 20:00.547
Your granddaughter?

20:01.798 --> 20:05.331
That's a very beautiful horse.
Does she have a name?

20:05.600 --> 20:08.733
Right down the block,
you will find the horse.

20:53.232 --> 20:54.765
- Hey.
- Hey, sweetie.

20:55.331 --> 20:56.998
Listen, you're one of us.

20:57.732 --> 20:59.374
- We're all here for you, OK?
- OK.

20:59.398 --> 21:00.941
Anything you need,
just tell us, OK?

21:00.965 --> 21:02.232
- OK.
- All right.

21:02.798 --> 21:05.441
We're gonna find the cocksuckers
that did this, mark my words.

21:05.465 --> 21:06.465
- OK.
- OK.

21:07.681 --> 21:10.281
- Joey loved you.
- He loved you, too.

21:11.732 --> 21:12.732
Hey, pal.

21:32.832 --> 21:33.832
Hey.

21:34.032 --> 21:35.032
How you doing?

21:36.165 --> 21:39.075
First you lose your wife,
now your partner.

21:39.099 --> 21:41.808
Hey, I'm gonna have a little
birthday party

21:41.832 --> 21:44.407
for the twins in two weeks.
Bring your son.

21:44.431 --> 21:45.498
He's in Florida.

21:46.732 --> 21:47.732
Florida?

21:47.932 --> 21:50.332
Why are you torturing
the poor kid?

22:16.680 --> 22:17.813
See you tomorrow.

22:30.720 --> 22:31.720
You know what?

22:35.280 --> 22:38.080
- I have a surprise for you.
-A surprise?

22:38.498 --> 22:39.498
Mm-hmm.

22:39.960 --> 22:42.427
You want to see it?
Close your eyes.

22:49.880 --> 22:50.880
Open them now.

22:57.160 --> 22:58.760
What? You don't like it?

22:59.040 --> 23:00.440
It's not my birthday.

23:00.840 --> 23:05.307
I know it's not your birthday.
This is for being such a good girl.

23:08.765 --> 23:09.765
Hmm?

23:11.560 --> 23:13.693
- What?
-I've been a good girl?

23:13.920 --> 23:15.520
You're a very good girl.

23:17.560 --> 23:18.560
Take it.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.733
Do you think Elisa's okay?

23:32.200 --> 23:33.200
I don't know...

23:35.360 --> 23:37.427
I wonder if she's okay at home.

23:38.040 --> 23:39.040
- Who?
-Elisa.

23:40.120 --> 23:41.120
- Who?
-Elisa.

23:43.280 --> 23:46.547
I suspect something is not okay.
I don't know...

24:03.398 --> 24:04.998
What's the charge?

24:05.064 --> 24:06.397
Shut up.

24:24.732 --> 24:26.841
Do you think he knows
why he's here?

24:26.865 --> 24:29.132
I think he knows
it's for murder.

24:29.164 --> 24:30.964
I think he knows that much.

24:31.498 --> 24:34.007
Why do you think
they call him Black?

24:34.031 --> 24:39.231
I asked his pal, Kendu Wallace, why they
called him Black but he didn't know.

24:40.498 --> 24:42.231
Did he know anything else?

24:42.998 --> 24:45.465
Well he knew Black
didn't like Joey.

24:46.298 --> 24:47.298
He knew that.

24:47.732 --> 24:48.732
Hmm...

24:48.765 --> 24:50.365
He said Black hated him.

24:52.832 --> 24:54.565
Can I ask y'all something?

24:54.865 --> 24:55.865
Please do.

24:57.832 --> 25:00.432
What did Kendu Wallace
ever do to you?

25:03.465 --> 25:05.732
I don't care
about Kendu Wallace.

25:06.798 --> 25:08.331
He means nothing to me.

25:08.997 --> 25:09.997
Yeah?

25:10.765 --> 25:11.765
Obviously.

25:20.098 --> 25:21.231
Say "good doggy."

25:21.320 --> 25:22.520
Say it in Spanish.

25:25.840 --> 25:26.708
Oh, how cute!

25:26.732 --> 25:27.732
Tell him again.

25:29.264 --> 25:30.731
Aww...

25:32.298 --> 25:34.698
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

25:35.498 --> 25:36.698
You're a good boy!

25:37.798 --> 25:39.398
Yeah, you're a good boy.

25:39.832 --> 25:42.774
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, don't fight it.

25:42.798 --> 25:45.174
Don't fight me...
Hey, look at me, don't fight it.

25:45.198 --> 25:46.865
Come on, I'm almost done.

25:46.964 --> 25:48.031
I'm almost done.

25:56.832 --> 26:01.032
Victims ID'd as Kendu
Wallace and Jennifer Richards.

26:08.997 --> 26:10.841
<i>Where's my bro, Rocky?</i>

26:10.865 --> 26:12.398
Washing your dirty dog.

26:12.832 --> 26:14.765
<i>Hey, careful, that's my baby.</i>

26:19.040 --> 26:20.773
I love you and I miss you.

26:21.160 --> 26:23.293
I love you and miss you so much.

26:24.120 --> 26:26.187
Me too, my love. I want a kiss.

26:28.040 --> 26:31.973
I told you her ring was too big,
that it kept falling off.

26:32.160 --> 26:33.360
Well, it fell off.

26:33.465 --> 26:35.240
None of that
same stuff again, Eva.

26:35.264 --> 26:37.040
<i>I'm calling from Iraq and
you're still talking about...</i>

26:37.064 --> 26:38.064
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

26:38.765 --> 26:40.474
Who's that causing ruckus
in my house, man?

26:40.498 --> 26:41.498
What?! What?!

26:41.832 --> 26:43.774
Who's calling from the
Middle East?

26:43.798 --> 26:45.331
My brother!

26:46.964 --> 26:49.040
<i>So you're a free man now,
my nigga.</i>

26:49.064 --> 26:50.064
Yeah.

26:50.164 --> 26:51.297
Wow. How it feel?

26:52.197 --> 26:54.207
I ain't trying
to go back in. Know that.

26:54.231 --> 26:56.407
<i>Hey, but listen to me,
you feel me?</i>

26:56.431 --> 26:58.774
You have to stand up
straight, you know?

26:58.798 --> 26:59.973
You don't have
the same opportunities

26:59.997 --> 27:01.708
like you used to have.
Do you hear me, Rocky?

27:01.732 --> 27:03.441
<i>Look at me, look at me
in the camera, over there.</i>

27:03.465 --> 27:06.465
No, your boy is done.
None of that bullshit.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.760
Isabel hooked me up
at this butcher shop.

27:10.560 --> 27:11.374
I'm cutting meat! Meat!

27:13.465 --> 27:15.532
<i>You like that meat, boy?</i>

27:18.164 --> 27:19.831
So everything OK?

27:21.298 --> 27:23.765
You need me
or why you call me here?

27:26.131 --> 27:28.131
How's things with you?

27:29.765 --> 27:31.565
Business is good, you know?

27:32.198 --> 27:33.198
How you?

27:34.864 --> 27:38.864
Well, they had me down at the
police station the other day.

27:40.798 --> 27:41.798
Oh, yeah? Why?

27:43.931 --> 27:46.864
Something about some cop
that got murdered.

27:47.231 --> 27:48.831
Um... a DT named Cullen.

27:51.031 --> 27:53.474
Oh, yeah...
yeah, I heard that there

27:53.498 --> 27:57.565
was a cop that got killed over
there in the subway at 191st.

28:01.498 --> 28:04.565
You know, they had some
snitch pictures, man,

28:05.732 --> 28:07.465
of you and some other cat.

28:08.331 --> 28:09.331
Me?

28:09.831 --> 28:10.831
No, no, no.

28:11.465 --> 28:14.465
Why? I don't know what
you're talking about.

28:15.498 --> 28:18.708
I couldn't figure it out either,
I'm like, you know...

28:18.732 --> 28:20.040
You know,
what type of connection

28:20.064 --> 28:21.174
could you have to this,
you know?

28:21.198 --> 28:22.198
Connection?

28:22.797 --> 28:25.708
Black, I have no connection
with no cops, man.

28:25.732 --> 28:28.474
You know, I'm just...
I'm just out here, you know,

28:28.498 --> 28:29.965
I'm always hustling...

28:30.465 --> 28:31.998
- Well...
- I don't...

28:32.431 --> 28:35.631
It was pictures of you
and some Dominican nigga

28:36.897 --> 28:38.097
in front of, um...

28:39.064 --> 28:40.064
Club Miami.

28:42.765 --> 28:43.765
Oh, OK, OK.

28:47.931 --> 28:50.198
That's my friend, Rocky.

28:53.297 --> 28:55.274
Yo, Rock, you should let
that nigga go, man!

28:55.298 --> 28:56.431
I'm serious, man!

28:59.797 --> 29:02.464
Look, my brother,
this is my bro's dog.

29:02.797 --> 29:06.174
How am I gonna put the dog
in harm's way? Explain it to me.

29:06.198 --> 29:07.198
Good boy!

29:07.264 --> 29:08.907
His brother was
a tough ass dude,

29:08.931 --> 29:10.873
that's why he got
a tough ass dog.

29:10.897 --> 29:12.830
Munch, the nigga is a dog, B!

29:13.897 --> 29:15.697
Shit, you don't understand!

29:16.031 --> 29:17.940
Cut some of that fur off
and you'll get it!

29:17.964 --> 29:20.031
So you're talking about Cullen.

29:21.164 --> 29:23.697
Cullen, Cullen,
the Detective Cullen?

29:23.732 --> 29:25.174
Oh, man, he's the devil.

29:25.198 --> 29:27.107
He is dirty, man, he's dirty.

29:27.131 --> 29:28.731
Do you know what he did?

29:28.797 --> 29:30.441
He violated my nigga
with a stick, man.

29:30.465 --> 29:31.465
He...

29:32.681 --> 29:34.873
I don't even want to talk
about that because it's just...

29:34.897 --> 29:38.964
It's just crazy that he did that
to Rocky, who just got out.

29:40.764 --> 29:43.441
He did three years,
he never snitched on me before,

29:43.465 --> 29:45.798
so I don't know
what he was doing,

29:46.364 --> 29:49.474
maybe he was scouting him
or something because...

29:49.498 --> 29:51.407
I don't know, but I have
nothing to do with that.

29:51.431 --> 29:52.431
I don't know...

29:53.280 --> 29:56.480
I don't know what you
want me to tell you, man.

29:58.398 --> 29:59.398
Pay that man.

30:06.600 --> 30:07.600
Come on.

30:08.080 --> 30:11.613
- José, I can't!
-Just one more time. A little peek.

30:13.800 --> 30:14.800
Oh, my God.

30:18.520 --> 30:21.787
I can't believe
I'm not there with you, my love.

30:22.120 --> 30:23.520
You're gonna kill me!

30:24.031 --> 30:25.031
Shh...

30:26.240 --> 30:27.640
You are just perfect.

30:29.840 --> 30:31.640
I know you'll be home soon.

30:34.040 --> 30:35.307
Let's just hope so.

30:36.520 --> 30:39.416
Let's see
if they don't screw me over again.

30:39.440 --> 30:42.173
The other day
I saw something beautiful.

30:42.560 --> 30:43.693
What did you see?

30:44.880 --> 30:47.680
It's hard to explain,
or to understand...

30:48.920 --> 30:49.920
<i>"but...</i>

30:52.200 --> 30:55.400
...it showed me
that you were coming back soon.

31:01.731 --> 31:04.264
You ever seen
one of those ant farms?

31:05.731 --> 31:08.441
I got one for Chrissy
for his birthday last year.

31:08.465 --> 31:11.732
He never looks at it,
but I find it fascinating.

31:13.964 --> 31:14.964
It's amazing...

31:20.031 --> 31:21.031
Leslie...

31:25.465 --> 31:27.132
Anyway this Joey thing...

31:29.764 --> 31:33.231
could get pretty ugly
if it's not handled properly.

31:33.498 --> 31:35.498
He had a lot of enemies and...

31:39.931 --> 31:43.598
I'm not just talking about
the drug dealers he robbed.

31:44.098 --> 31:45.831
I know he was your partner

31:46.064 --> 31:48.464
but Scotty,
he was a fucking idiot.

31:51.498 --> 31:53.365
You know, he was very dirty.

31:53.931 --> 31:57.198
And, unfortunately,
his dirt caught up with him.

31:57.264 --> 32:00.407
But at least his wife
will get his full pension.

32:00.431 --> 32:03.098
Now, the more you dig
the more you risk

32:03.731 --> 32:06.931
screwing up that pension
for his wife and kids.

32:08.131 --> 32:11.598
And I don't think you want
that on your conscience.

32:13.031 --> 32:16.274
Like Chrissy's ant farm,
sometimes the ants die.

32:16.298 --> 32:18.374
The other day I'm looking
at a dead one,

32:18.398 --> 32:19.740
and he's all the way down
at the bottom,

32:19.764 --> 32:20.773
and all the other ants are...

32:20.797 --> 32:24.197
crawling all over him
like it's nothing, you know?

32:25.298 --> 32:26.298
No big deal.

32:31.231 --> 32:33.231
And Black, Mr. Jonathan Jones?

32:36.364 --> 32:37.831
There's nothing there.

32:37.897 --> 32:38.897
He has motive.

32:40.797 --> 32:41.997
What's his motive?

32:42.465 --> 32:45.598
It seems like Joey was
maybe blackmailing him.

32:46.398 --> 32:47.398
Extorting him.

32:49.431 --> 32:50.431
I don't know.

32:50.864 --> 32:52.797
But he definitely has motive.

32:53.164 --> 32:54.497
Mr. Jones.

32:57.131 --> 32:58.407
The Feds have been all over him

32:58.431 --> 32:59.498
for a while now.

33:00.298 --> 33:01.298
Years.

33:01.764 --> 33:02.764
He knew that.

33:03.465 --> 33:04.998
He's not killing a cop.

33:09.198 --> 33:10.198
OK.

33:11.064 --> 33:12.197
Who else you got?

33:13.831 --> 33:16.431
Well, I'm waiting on MTA.
forensics...

33:18.831 --> 33:20.031
There's this girl.

33:21.764 --> 33:22.764
I don't know.

33:24.198 --> 33:26.465
I think she might
know something.

33:48.398 --> 33:50.473
This nigga's buggin'.
I'm lying?

33:50.497 --> 33:52.564
Yeah, nigga on some other shit!

33:52.731 --> 33:53.907
Hating is a weak emotion.

33:53.931 --> 33:55.440
Y'all niggas gotta be
better than that, B.

33:55.464 --> 33:57.531
How's it going, man?
All good?

34:01.264 --> 34:03.331
Just out here.
What about you?

34:04.364 --> 34:07.497
Just chillin', my nigga,
just got off of work.

34:09.440 --> 34:12.773
My mom said she saw you
at the butcher shop cutting meat.

34:12.797 --> 34:13.797
cutting meat.

34:14.780 --> 34:16.739
I got a switch
my whole style up, you feel me?

34:16.764 --> 34:19.107
Yeah, man.
I know, I know how it is.

34:19.130 --> 34:20.739
I don't know if you heard,

34:20.764 --> 34:23.007
but that detective
you had beef with,

34:23.031 --> 34:26.563
somebody caught that nigga
in the subway. He's dead.

34:28.297 --> 34:29.297
So what?

34:31.280 --> 34:34.239
I don't care nothing
about that faggot ass cop.

34:34.264 --> 34:36.255
Whether he's dead or alive, B.

34:36.280 --> 34:40.347
I hear you, but the cops got
some snitch pics of you and me.

34:41.080 --> 34:45.080
I'm just giving you the heads up
in case they come calling.

34:45.600 --> 34:47.933
I'm telling you this, just in case.

34:48.764 --> 34:50.174
Maybe you should lay low.

34:50.197 --> 34:51.197
Yo, my nigga.

34:52.130 --> 34:55.797
I already told you, that shit
ain't up for discussion.

34:56.040 --> 34:59.373
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with you...

35:00.080 --> 35:02.347
...blessed art thou among women...

35:02.560 --> 35:05.656
...and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

35:05.680 --> 35:08.413
Now, and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

35:09.080 --> 35:11.813
- My love.
-See you next week. Good-bye.

35:13.731 --> 35:14.731
Olga.

35:16.600 --> 35:17.600
Yes, dear.

35:19.120 --> 35:20.253
Do you believe...

35:21.560 --> 35:23.493
...that God would allow us...

35:25.040 --> 35:26.173
...to see angels?

35:29.520 --> 35:30.987
Yes, if He chooses so.

35:32.360 --> 35:34.760
He can close our eyes, or open them.

35:39.640 --> 35:40.640
Certainly...

35:42.680 --> 35:43.880
...he must have...

35:45.440 --> 35:47.507
...a very special plan for you.

35:49.680 --> 35:50.680
For your life.

35:53.200 --> 35:54.200
Thank you.

37:11.430 --> 37:14.097
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

37:29.160 --> 37:30.693
Isa? Isa, you in there?

37:32.320 --> 37:33.320
Isa?

37:34.320 --> 37:36.920
- Yes, I'll be right out.
-Open, open!

37:40.997 --> 37:42.130
Open, open, open!

37:43.131 --> 37:44.131
Open!

37:54.400 --> 37:57.200
I'm getting married!
He finally proposed!

38:08.363 --> 38:10.830
- OK, you ready partner?
- Yeah, OK.

38:10.897 --> 38:12.564
Let's get this over with.

38:23.764 --> 38:26.097
Well, our main concern
is for you.

38:26.764 --> 38:28.831
So what are you saying exactly?

38:29.164 --> 38:31.831
If things came out
and an investigation

38:33.263 --> 38:35.263
were opened on Joey, you know.

38:38.064 --> 38:40.531
We wouldn't want that
to jeopardize,

38:41.497 --> 38:43.164
you know, Joey's pension.

38:46.430 --> 38:48.763
Really?
So you come into my house,

38:53.064 --> 38:57.064
my and my dead husband's house,
and you're telling me what?

38:57.897 --> 39:00.964
That you're not going
to go after his killer?

39:01.031 --> 39:02.831
I want you out of my house.

39:04.797 --> 39:06.973
Scotty, make her get
out of my house!

39:06.997 --> 39:08.664
I don't want her in here!

39:09.230 --> 39:11.630
OK, partner,
I'll meet you outside.

39:16.997 --> 39:18.997
You know what you are, Scotty?

39:20.864 --> 39:22.197
Well, I'll tell you.

39:24.497 --> 39:25.564
You're pathetic.

39:27.064 --> 39:28.064
Look at me.

39:30.163 --> 39:31.296
Nobody likes you.

39:32.464 --> 39:33.464
Janine...

39:34.197 --> 39:36.664
Don't Janine me.
You had one friend!

39:36.897 --> 39:39.630
You had one fucking person
in this world

39:40.764 --> 39:43.031
who gave
a flying fuck about you!

39:43.130 --> 39:47.330
Who took you kid every weekend
because you couldn't handle it!

39:49.464 --> 39:50.864
Who watched your son!

39:51.430 --> 39:54.963
You couldn't even take care
of your own fucking son!

39:57.464 --> 39:59.464
And this is how you treat him?

40:08.800 --> 40:10.467
I feel like I'm dreaming.

40:11.680 --> 40:15.347
- I can't believe I'll be home soon.
-I know, my love.

40:16.120 --> 40:18.987
Me too... I don't know.
It's like a dream.

40:45.497 --> 40:47.097
What about her?

40:47.560 --> 40:50.427
What's up with this cop?
I don't know her.

40:52.063 --> 40:54.730
I'm sorry, officer,
my English no good.

40:55.040 --> 40:56.107
You have a card?

40:56.363 --> 40:58.030
If I see him, I call you.

41:00.263 --> 41:02.039
Lemme see, lemme see.
You see this guy?

41:02.063 --> 41:04.339
He don't look Dominican,
he look Puerto Rican.

41:07.797 --> 41:08.797
OK.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.733
I'm gonna ask you again.
His name is Manuel de la Cruz.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.373
I don't know these people.

41:18.160 --> 41:19.293
I don't know him.

41:22.600 --> 41:25.667
You don't know this guy either?
Arnaldo Ruiz?

41:28.360 --> 41:32.093
- Because he says he knows you.
-I don't know anything.

41:34.160 --> 41:35.960
We don't know those people.

41:38.680 --> 41:42.813
And I guess you don't know
that he was killed a few days ago.

41:46.040 --> 41:47.040
Well...

41:47.760 --> 41:48.760
What a shame.

41:49.764 --> 41:51.031
He's so young, too.

41:51.920 --> 41:54.187
Too much violence with these kids.

42:02.800 --> 42:05.200
Hey, he punches hard as hell though.

42:09.097 --> 42:10.773
What, you're bigger than me now?

42:10.797 --> 42:12.530
You're bigger than me now?

42:21.764 --> 42:22.723
Lucky!

42:52.497 --> 42:55.406
We regret to inform you
that your son,

42:55.430 --> 42:58.563
José Alvarez de la Cruz,
was killed in action.

43:15.831 --> 43:17.473
My nephew is no slouch either.

43:17.497 --> 43:19.406
Let me tell you
how good a cop he is.

43:19.430 --> 43:23.173
He is, in my opinion, the best
doughnut guy we ever had!

43:23.197 --> 43:25.864
And he was nice enough
to give a ticket

43:26.297 --> 43:27.939
to an old girlfriend of mine.

43:27.963 --> 43:31.106
A chick who, sad to say,
broke the D-man's heart.

43:31.130 --> 43:32.797
How much was that ticket?

43:32.963 --> 43:35.963
Oh, that's right,
$250 for blocking the bus!

43:38.430 --> 43:40.897
I call him
the brains of the outfit.

44:31.363 --> 44:35.430
Hey, Rocky, I'm sorry to hear
about your brother, José, man.

44:35.497 --> 44:37.939
Just waiting until I clear
my head some more, you feel me?

44:37.963 --> 44:39.363
I feel you, but look,

44:40.464 --> 44:42.939
the police came
looking for you the other day.

44:42.963 --> 44:44.630
- For real?
- Seriously.

44:46.497 --> 44:47.897
Yo, that must be what

44:48.146 --> 44:49.773
that nigga Naldo was talking
about, remember?

44:49.797 --> 44:51.664
Come on, bra, pay attention.

44:51.830 --> 44:53.497
That nigga Naldo is dead.

44:53.797 --> 44:57.464
- That nigga's dead, B?
- Yeah, my dude, nigga's dead.

45:04.330 --> 45:06.039
You just watch your back, man.

45:06.063 --> 45:08.039
Word is Black is the one
that killed Naldo.

45:08.063 --> 45:09.263
That's crazy, man.

45:09.297 --> 45:12.230
Maybe you should just
lay low for a minute.

45:16.130 --> 45:17.530
What is it?

45:19.796 --> 45:22.129
Come on,
what do you got, partner?

45:23.130 --> 45:25.197
I don't know, probably nothing.

45:27.297 --> 45:29.697
Isn't that the girl
from the photo?

45:34.963 --> 45:37.296
- What?
- Tell me about your kids.

45:38.464 --> 45:39.731
My kids?

45:43.130 --> 45:44.663
What do you wanna know?

45:46.297 --> 45:47.564
What are they like?

45:48.763 --> 45:50.563
They're loud. They're wild.

45:51.497 --> 45:53.564
They're annoying. They're loud.

45:56.763 --> 45:57.763
Yeah.

46:00.030 --> 46:01.363
What about you, huh?

46:01.731 --> 46:03.064
What about your kid?

46:04.397 --> 46:05.864
- He's quiet.
- Yeah.

46:06.497 --> 46:08.697
- And sloppy.
- Yeah.

46:10.830 --> 46:11.897
He's a good kid.

46:13.497 --> 46:14.497
Anthony.

46:19.720 --> 46:21.320
How are you doing, dear?

46:29.880 --> 46:31.547
Marisol, how's she doing?

46:34.120 --> 46:37.053
- It's hard for everybody.
-Yes, of course.

46:37.920 --> 46:40.720
If you need anything,
please let me know.

46:41.680 --> 46:42.680
Thanks so much.

46:44.730 --> 46:46.797
Hey, let me ask you a question.

46:48.763 --> 46:51.163
What'd you really
think about Joey?

46:55.830 --> 46:58.430
He was there for me
when my wife died.

47:00.330 --> 47:01.330
Yeah. OK.

47:11.796 --> 47:12.336
Elisa...

47:12.360 --> 47:14.293
- Elisa, are you okay?
-Yes.

47:18.920 --> 47:19.987
What's her name?

47:22.397 --> 47:23.397
Isabel.

47:25.520 --> 47:27.453
Really? You named her Isabel?

47:27.800 --> 47:28.800
Yes.

47:31.197 --> 47:32.197
Isa...

47:36.730 --> 47:37.730
You OK, Mami?

47:50.120 --> 47:51.320
You gonna be okay?

47:59.640 --> 48:00.640
Go. I'll close.

48:02.996 --> 48:03.896
OK...

48:03.920 --> 48:04.920
Go, go.

48:14.920 --> 48:17.187
It seems your mom is running late.

48:19.560 --> 48:22.560
Don't worry. She'll be home soon.
Come here.

48:28.400 --> 48:31.733
- I'll take you home.
-No, I don't wanna go home.

48:33.640 --> 48:37.040
But you have to go home.
Your mom is running late.

48:40.680 --> 48:42.280
Can I come to your home?

48:45.000 --> 48:47.133
No. You have to go to your home.

48:56.840 --> 48:58.107
Let's go. Let's go.

49:34.960 --> 49:35.960
Hello.

49:38.640 --> 49:39.640
Hello, my love.

49:40.120 --> 49:41.453
I'm Elisa's teacher.

49:42.920 --> 49:44.053
What's your name?

49:45.680 --> 49:46.680
Isabel.

49:47.920 --> 49:50.787
Thank you very much
for bringing her home.

50:35.280 --> 50:36.347
You're pregnant.

50:39.560 --> 50:40.893
That's not possible.

51:09.730 --> 51:10.797
Janine.

51:12.263 --> 51:14.396
Keep your eyes closed!

51:17.763 --> 51:18.763
OK.

51:19.763 --> 51:21.430
Are they closed?

51:22.830 --> 51:23.830
Yeah.

51:27.330 --> 51:28.330
OK.

51:28.996 --> 51:29.996
Happy Birthday.

51:36.130 --> 51:37.130
You remembered.

51:37.996 --> 51:39.529
Of course I remembered.

51:40.496 --> 51:42.173
Now you gotta make a wish.

51:42.197 --> 51:43.197
Come on.

52:00.163 --> 52:01.163
It's good.

52:10.330 --> 52:12.397
- Janine...
- You gotta relax.

52:14.197 --> 52:16.730
The kids won't be
back till tomorrow.

52:17.130 --> 52:19.930
You swore at me
'cause I was mean to you.

52:21.429 --> 52:22.896
- But I lied.
- Yeah.

52:25.063 --> 52:28.596
When I said that you didn't
have no fucking friends.

52:30.730 --> 52:31.797
I'm your friend.

52:33.197 --> 52:34.597
And I care about you.

52:38.263 --> 52:39.263
Hmm?

52:43.396 --> 52:45.329
- We can't.
- We can't what?

52:47.730 --> 52:48.730
I can't.

52:49.863 --> 52:50.863
What?

52:57.796 --> 52:58.796
Janine...

53:00.230 --> 53:01.230
Janine...

53:01.830 --> 53:02.830
Janine, what?

53:03.496 --> 53:04.496
Shh...

53:05.796 --> 53:06.796
It's OK.

53:08.730 --> 53:10.463
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

53:16.763 --> 53:17.763
Janine...

53:18.097 --> 53:20.564
If you want to leave,
you can leave.

53:23.830 --> 53:26.097
But it ain't
no good being alone.

53:37.263 --> 53:38.263
Hey...

53:40.400 --> 53:42.600
I have something to tell you all.

53:45.396 --> 53:46.929
We need some good news.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.867
Something... really marvelous.
Incredible.

53:55.240 --> 53:57.907
Something very unexpected
has happened.

53:58.760 --> 53:59.760
It's a miracle.

54:03.040 --> 54:04.040
Say it already!

54:06.920 --> 54:07.920
I'm pregnant.

54:12.280 --> 54:16.147
It's a miracle. It's crazy.
I don't know how it happened.

54:17.880 --> 54:21.947
But how can you be pregnant?
José stayed in Iraq for a year.

54:22.320 --> 54:23.320
I know, I know.

54:25.840 --> 54:26.840
It's a miracle!

54:30.840 --> 54:34.640
Remember what I told you I saw
that night in the subway?

54:37.080 --> 54:40.147
It was so incredible
words can't describe it.

54:40.600 --> 54:42.467
I believe that night, God...

54:43.720 --> 54:47.453
...and the blessed mother
did something special for me.

54:48.240 --> 54:49.240
For all of us.

54:53.720 --> 54:56.453
He already knew
José wasn't coming home.

54:57.680 --> 54:59.280
So he gave us this gift.

55:03.960 --> 55:05.360
Gloria, I'm pregnant.

55:07.196 --> 55:08.196
Gloria...

55:12.000 --> 55:13.600
You would do this to us?

55:15.440 --> 55:17.173
You would do this to José?

55:30.996 --> 55:33.439
She needs to leave
this house right now.

55:33.463 --> 55:35.238
Let her parents
take care of her.

55:35.262 --> 55:39.062
- I don't want her here!
- I'll tell her to leave.

55:45.280 --> 55:46.280
Manuel...

55:48.080 --> 55:49.747
You do believe me, right?

56:14.796 --> 56:16.796
You think I don't feel guilty?

56:17.963 --> 56:18.963
I don't know.

56:19.763 --> 56:20.763
Of course I do.

56:21.496 --> 56:23.496
But you should feel way worse!

56:26.396 --> 56:27.396
Come on.

56:28.129 --> 56:29.729
Don't be a little pussy.

56:30.196 --> 56:31.996
We didn't do nothing wrong.

56:32.229 --> 56:34.762
Your wife is dead,
my husband's dead.

56:35.763 --> 56:36.896
We're just human.

56:39.063 --> 56:40.063
I know.

56:46.229 --> 56:48.562
Besides,
Joey wasn't no choir boy.

56:53.830 --> 56:54.830
Yeah, I know.

56:56.629 --> 57:00.362
I know he took money from
dealers. Everybody knew that.

57:01.030 --> 57:02.030
Yeah.

57:03.229 --> 57:04.696
He did more than that.

57:05.162 --> 57:08.762
Remember that... A few years
ago, that Dominican kid?

57:09.996 --> 57:11.063
Yeah, of course.

57:11.896 --> 57:12.896
What about it?

57:14.730 --> 57:16.130
He did do it, Scotty.

57:17.030 --> 57:20.697
One day he just broke down,
and he told me everything.

57:24.863 --> 57:27.038
But the kid was a real
troublemaker, you know?

57:27.062 --> 57:29.062
He was dealing drugs and shit.

57:30.996 --> 57:34.796
Joey said he was just trying
to mess with him, you know?

57:38.296 --> 57:42.429
But I don't want my Joey's name
tarnished with this shit, OK?

57:42.463 --> 57:43.796
I mean, we got kids!

57:45.196 --> 57:47.196
I mean, you owe him that much.

59:19.496 --> 59:20.563
Hello?

59:21.096 --> 59:22.429
Hey, buddy, it's me.

59:23.096 --> 59:24.096
How's it going?

59:24.863 --> 59:26.330
Hi, Dad, I'm sleeping.

59:27.763 --> 59:29.030
I know. I know, OK.

59:30.962 --> 59:32.095
Go back to sleep.

59:33.162 --> 59:34.829
<i>Dad, did you get my card?</i>

59:35.262 --> 59:36.262
I did.

59:37.896 --> 59:39.496
It's the best card ever.

59:41.763 --> 59:43.096
You really liked it?

59:44.896 --> 59:45.896
I loved it.

59:48.496 --> 59:50.963
Uh...
I'm coming down to visit soon.

59:54.096 --> 59:55.096
When?

59:57.396 --> 59:58.396
Soon.

59:59.896 --> 01:00:03.829
I just gotta finish a case here,
and then I'm coming down.

01:00:05.429 --> 01:00:06.829
Anthony?

01:00:08.062 --> 01:00:10.062
Anthony, OK, go back to sleep.

01:00:12.296 --> 01:00:13.696
- <i>Oh, Dad...</i>
- Yeah.

01:00:14.796 --> 01:00:16.729
Did you have a nice birthday?

01:00:18.962 --> 01:00:20.162
Yeah, it was good.

01:00:22.362 --> 01:00:23.362
The, uh...

01:00:25.496 --> 01:00:28.829
The guys, um... they had
a little cake, you know,

01:00:31.096 --> 01:00:34.496
and a little something for me
down at the station.

01:00:35.496 --> 01:00:37.363
It was...
It was real nice.

01:00:41.895 --> 01:00:44.028
OK, um... go back to sleep, huh.

01:00:47.496 --> 01:00:49.696
- I love you.
- <i>Good night, Dad.</i>

01:00:50.129 --> 01:00:52.596
- <i>I love you, too.</i>
- OK, good night.

01:00:54.895 --> 01:00:55.962
Good night, pal.

01:01:28.196 --> 01:01:29.196
Olga, Olga...

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.800
It's so good to see you.

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:38.880
How have you been?

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:41.347
Everything is fine.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.136
I came by your house a few times,
but you were always out.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.360
I wanted to show you the miracle.

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:52.587
Yes, I heard you were pregnant.

01:01:52.763 --> 01:01:53.763
Mm-hmm.

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.896
I know this miracle
is hard for people to understand...

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.896
...but if anyone would understand,
I knew it would be you.

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:02.853
Look, Isabel...
I have more shopping to do.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.320
<i>Olga...</i>

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:09.893
...l would love for you to pray for me
and the baby.

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.360
Isabel..

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:15.347
What you need is to talk
to the priest.

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.653
Just a simple blessing, Olga.

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.627
I feel peace when I hear you pray.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:44.560
Father...

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.507
...Almighty Lord...

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.520
I bless you for allowing...

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.600
...a baby to form
in the womb of your daughter.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:58.320
Help Isabel...

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.107
...to guard this new life...

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:07.280
...so no one can hurt it in any way.

01:03:09.929 --> 01:03:10.929
Amen.

01:03:13.262 --> 01:03:14.262
Amen.

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:16.293
Good-bye, Isabel.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:23.960
Thank you.

01:03:34.396 --> 01:03:37.038
Playboy, how much
they pay you up in here?

01:03:37.062 --> 01:03:38.439
Why, you need a job?

01:03:38.463 --> 01:03:40.663
Nah, man,
I'm just curious, man.

01:03:42.496 --> 01:03:43.496
Ah, let me see.

01:03:44.496 --> 01:03:46.296
How about some... pig butt?

01:03:48.795 --> 01:03:50.928
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:03:51.062 --> 01:03:52.062
Pork butt.

01:03:53.229 --> 01:03:54.229
Yeah.

01:03:56.196 --> 01:03:59.063
Let me get the biggest piece
you got, man.

01:04:00.995 --> 01:04:01.995
Yeah.

01:04:06.463 --> 01:04:08.730
And trim
all that fat off, homie.

01:04:10.463 --> 01:04:11.463
Yeah.

01:04:20.795 --> 01:04:21.795
Yeah.

01:04:22.463 --> 01:04:25.463
You know I like my butt
to be firm, feel me?

01:04:30.362 --> 01:04:32.029
You know, for some reason

01:04:33.729 --> 01:04:35.738
I just feel like
you one of them brothers

01:04:35.762 --> 01:04:38.362
that's been violated before,
you know?

01:04:38.463 --> 01:04:40.396
Like I don't know what it is,

01:04:40.762 --> 01:04:43.162
but I just get
that vibe, you know.

01:04:44.129 --> 01:04:46.462
That type of energy
from you, man.

01:04:49.162 --> 01:04:53.095
Have you ever been sodomized
or anything like that before?

01:04:54.429 --> 01:04:56.439
Now I'm just saying, no, no, no,
hear me out, hear me out,

01:04:56.463 --> 01:04:57.930
because if you have...

01:04:59.962 --> 01:05:01.362
it wasn't your fault.

01:05:02.196 --> 01:05:03.263
Because you see,

01:05:05.012 --> 01:05:08.545
if you decided to kill the
nigga that did it to you.

01:05:10.362 --> 01:05:14.229
I don't think anybody would
hold that against you, homie.

01:05:15.196 --> 01:05:19.129
So you obviously know more
about me than I know about you.

01:05:20.429 --> 01:05:22.562
- I tell you what.
- What's up?

01:05:22.795 --> 01:05:26.138
- This is what I need you to do.
- What you need me to do?

01:05:26.162 --> 01:05:28.162
I need you to go to the police

01:05:28.296 --> 01:05:30.963
and tell them
what happened between you

01:05:31.296 --> 01:05:33.696
and that little faggot cop,
Cullen.

01:05:35.895 --> 01:05:37.562
Because you see right now

01:05:38.229 --> 01:05:41.429
they thinking that I'm
the one that killed him.

01:05:43.795 --> 01:05:47.528
And you and me both know
that that ain't what happened.

01:05:48.162 --> 01:05:50.205
If you came here to kill me,
right?

01:05:50.229 --> 01:05:53.362
You better make sure
you do a good job, homie.

01:05:54.362 --> 01:05:57.095
And that's the only thing
I'ma tell you.

01:05:58.962 --> 01:06:01.629
You know,
under different circumstances

01:06:04.762 --> 01:06:06.439
you could've been
one of my top employees.

01:06:06.463 --> 01:06:07.930
Thank you, come again.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.467
We're so happy that you're back home.

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.405
I'll pray the rosary tomorrow.

01:06:30.429 --> 01:06:31.429
Mm...

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.507
Do you want to come with me?

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:39.720
I can't. I have to work.

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.733
How is your work going?

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.067
Bring on the next one.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:18.560
Enjoy.

01:07:35.929 --> 01:07:40.129
Isabel, I need
to talk to Manuel De La Cruz.

01:07:41.729 --> 01:07:43.996
Do you know
where I can find him?

01:07:49.729 --> 01:07:51.372
Half-a-pound of that now?

01:07:51.396 --> 01:07:52.471
She's crazy out here.

01:07:52.495 --> 01:07:54.228
Nah, we got to get at her.

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:58.138
Hi.

01:07:58.162 --> 01:07:59.495
Isabella Rossellini.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.160
Where's Manuel?

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:04.027
He left town for a while.

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:05.387
Where did he go?

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.920
He just needed to go away
for a while.

01:08:12.196 --> 01:08:15.396
A little vacation,
you know, to clear his head.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:21.240
When will he be back?

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.372
Only God knows that.

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:33.107
Boys, our shift is over.
Time to re-up.

01:08:38.729 --> 01:08:41.395
- Dibronski.
- He's downtown.

01:08:41.895 --> 01:08:42.895
Oh, perfect.

01:08:46.296 --> 01:08:47.363
Hey, talk to me.

01:08:49.995 --> 01:08:51.194
Well, let's see...

01:08:52.296 --> 01:08:53.296
He's dead.

01:08:54.729 --> 01:08:55.729
He's dead.

01:08:56.795 --> 01:08:57.795
She's dead.

01:08:58.862 --> 01:09:01.462
Mr. De La Cruz
is nowhere to be found.

01:09:02.196 --> 01:09:04.729
And she saw something.
She was there.

01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:08.738
But what am I gonna do?
Bring her in?

01:09:08.761 --> 01:09:10.429
She'll be dead in a week.

01:09:11.261 --> 01:09:12.862
No one's saying a thing.

01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:16.595
And suddenly nobody
speaks English either.

01:09:17.095 --> 01:09:20.205
Well, your Spanish is
half-way decent, isn't it?

01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:23.705
My Spanish fucking sucks,
but that's not the problem.

01:09:23.729 --> 01:09:27.005
It's just nobody's talking.
Nobody's saying a fucking thing.

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:28.904
And I don't fucking blame them.

01:09:28.929 --> 01:09:30.862
But somebody knows something.

01:09:31.395 --> 01:09:32.995
She knows what happened.

01:09:33.729 --> 01:09:37.261
But what am I gonna do?
Haul her in? Get her killed?

01:09:39.462 --> 01:09:40.462
Shit!

01:10:05.462 --> 01:10:06.871
Are you a known felon?

01:10:08.929 --> 01:10:10.905
Because Mr. Jonathan Jones here

01:10:10.929 --> 01:10:13.596
cannot associate
with any known felons.

01:10:24.762 --> 01:10:26.495
So this is their new plan?

01:10:29.062 --> 01:10:31.862
To just sit there
and harass me to death?

01:10:33.729 --> 01:10:36.796
What can you do?
They think you killed a cop.

01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:06.428
OK.

01:11:20.995 --> 01:11:21.995
Oh...

01:11:22.395 --> 01:11:23.528
I know you.

01:11:25.495 --> 01:11:26.495
I remember you!

01:11:34.962 --> 01:11:35.962
I remember you!

01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:40.771
Elisa, don't move!

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:46.227
What are you doing?

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:54.360
You can't do that.

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:56.880
You can't do that.

01:11:58.760 --> 01:11:59.760
Look at me.

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.347
You could have killed yourself.
Don't ever do that.

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.933
Where are your parents?

01:12:07.495 --> 01:12:08.495
Huh?

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:13.733
Where are your parents?

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I don't know.

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.573
Who did this to you?

01:12:25.462 --> 01:12:26.462
Huh?

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:29.013
Who did this to you?

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.280
You like it?

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:33.320
Come here.

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.240
It's getting late.

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:54.880
You know what?

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:58.376
Since I was little,
I always loved the name Elisa.

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:01.267
And I told all my friends
to call me that.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.467
You have a very, very beautiful name.

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:14.240
- Let's go. Let's go.
-Yes, Isabel.

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:31.320
My baby.

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:39.427
I'm so tired, Mama. My back hurts.

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:43.373
Baby, you need
to take care of yourself.

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:45.587
You need to rest more.

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:50.240
Do you want me to prepare you
a hot, nice bath?

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:53.360
- Yes? Okay, I'll be back.
-Thank you, Mama.

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:05.187
A nice, hot bath will do you good.

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.240
Tomorrow I have to take you home.

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.427
I love you, Isabel.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.400
Isabel, my love. Your bath is ready.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:56.507
- It's ready, my love.
-I’m so tired. I'm going to sleep.

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.920
Okay, my love. That's fine.

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:05.600
My love.

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:09.507
You know,
I'm so happy that you are home now.

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.560
We both missed you so much.

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:21.987
Yes, Mama. See you tomorrow.

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:26.093
See you tomorrow.

01:16:42.762 --> 01:16:44.738
We're going to show Uncle Scotty

01:16:44.762 --> 01:16:46.629
how pretty your hair can be.

01:16:47.395 --> 01:16:48.395
Her.

01:16:48.894 --> 01:16:49.894
Who is this?

01:16:51.729 --> 01:16:52.729
A girl.

01:16:53.495 --> 01:16:54.495
I can see that.

01:16:58.961 --> 01:17:01.828
Joey had some photos of her
on his camera.

01:17:01.862 --> 01:17:04.471
She's related to the
Dominican kid that he had that...

01:17:04.495 --> 01:17:05.495
Shh.

01:17:06.661 --> 01:17:08.805
Hey, sweetheart,
you want to go upstairs?

01:17:08.829 --> 01:17:11.229
You can go watch some cartoons,
OK?

01:17:12.028 --> 01:17:13.028
They love TV.

01:17:18.361 --> 01:17:20.837
Was Joey messing round
with this bitch?

01:17:20.861 --> 01:17:21.861
I don't know.

01:17:22.994 --> 01:17:24.371
Yeah, so what's your point?

01:17:24.395 --> 01:17:26.805
I mean, what's this
got to do with anything?

01:17:26.829 --> 01:17:29.937
I don't know, I just wanted to
know if he mentioned anything,

01:17:29.961 --> 01:17:32.561
or if you ever saw her
or or anything.

01:17:35.228 --> 01:17:37.028
No, I never saw her before.

01:17:49.028 --> 01:17:51.561
So are you gonna
stay a little while?

01:17:52.395 --> 01:17:53.395
I can't.

01:17:54.195 --> 01:17:55.795
I gotta get to the city.

01:17:56.795 --> 01:17:57.795
Whatever.

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.347
Can we go to the park?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.333
Not this time, precious.
I need to take you home.

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:25.520
Elisa, come on.

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:34.280
Walk faster.

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:38.256
- I don't want to go home!
-We have to get you home.

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.496
- I don't want to!
-Please, please.

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:43.387
- I don't want to go home!
-Elisa, please.

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:47.907
- I don't want to!
-Okay, calm down.

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.787
Okay. It's alright.
It's alright.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.667
Come on. Come on. Come with me.

01:19:08.994 --> 01:19:10.927
- So that's it?
- That's it.

01:19:11.994 --> 01:19:13.994
And what about Jonathan Jones?

01:19:14.761 --> 01:19:16.694
We're just gonna let him off?

01:19:16.994 --> 01:19:19.527
Is your gut telling you
he's our guy?

01:19:20.794 --> 01:19:24.527
Cause what about the kid
that Joey allegedly sodomized?

01:19:25.061 --> 01:19:26.128
Any word on him?

01:19:27.728 --> 01:19:30.328
It's either him
or Jonathan Jones, OK?

01:19:31.161 --> 01:19:32.294
I know that much.

01:19:33.095 --> 01:19:36.028
Scotty you're not gonna
drop this, are you?

01:19:40.462 --> 01:19:41.462
What is this?

01:19:45.828 --> 01:19:46.828
Who is she?

01:19:47.061 --> 01:19:48.861
Well, your buddy raped her.

01:19:53.228 --> 01:19:56.961
At least that's what she said,
and will say under oath.

01:19:57.861 --> 01:20:00.861
We're dropping the
investigation, let it go.

01:20:01.728 --> 01:20:03.328
Your buddy was a rapist.

01:20:03.961 --> 01:20:06.304
You understand me?
He was not a good guy.

01:20:06.328 --> 01:20:09.995
The department's not gonna
take a fall for that prick.

01:20:10.761 --> 01:20:12.961
So the case is dropped
for good.

01:20:14.161 --> 01:20:15.161
It's dead.

01:20:18.095 --> 01:20:19.095
That's it.

01:20:36.061 --> 01:20:37.837
They're not gonna be
bothering you anymore.

01:20:37.861 --> 01:20:40.004
I got the inside line,
the cops are dropping

01:20:40.028 --> 01:20:42.137
the investigation
into Joey Cullen's murder.

01:20:42.161 --> 01:20:44.894
And I am 100 percent
certain about that.

01:20:46.794 --> 01:20:48.171
That's what I want to hear.

01:20:48.195 --> 01:20:49.862
You did good, Mr. Himmel.

01:20:50.361 --> 01:20:52.628
But you know
I woulda killed him,

01:20:53.861 --> 01:20:55.794
that crooked-ass cop, Cullen.

01:20:56.794 --> 01:20:59.594
But, I guess somebody else
beat me to it.

01:21:00.794 --> 01:21:02.927
Well, it's all over now.
Right?

01:21:05.794 --> 01:21:06.794
Yeah, almost.

01:21:08.894 --> 01:21:10.161
One more loose end.

01:21:27.128 --> 01:21:28.195
My bigger nigga.

01:21:29.462 --> 01:21:30.595
Come on, my dude.

01:21:31.128 --> 01:21:32.128
Actually, um...

01:21:32.495 --> 01:21:35.028
I'm looking for
that homicidal maniac

01:21:35.095 --> 01:21:36.371
you be running with, man.

01:21:36.395 --> 01:21:39.195
I haven't seen Rocky
in a long time, man.

01:21:39.328 --> 01:21:41.471
Well, I got some unfinished
business with him.

01:21:41.495 --> 01:21:43.162
Let's talk upstairs, bro.

01:22:25.928 --> 01:22:28.261
You know,
I'll give you one thing.

01:22:30.195 --> 01:22:33.128
You definitely
one little tough nigga, man.

01:22:37.928 --> 01:22:40.795
But you see the game
is over now, playboy.

01:22:41.462 --> 01:22:42.462
Yeah.

01:22:44.111 --> 01:22:47.911
I can't afford you bleeding
on these $1,500 Ferragamo's!

01:22:59.428 --> 01:23:01.428
I'll tell you what.
I got it.

01:23:03.195 --> 01:23:05.995
I mean that's the least
I can do for you.

01:23:18.161 --> 01:23:21.028
I told you to make sure
you do a good job.

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.360
Isabel? Everything okay?

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:45.907
- Yes.
-Are you sure?

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:52.120
- Yes.
-You know that we love you, right?

01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:56.427
You know that I love you.

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:06.907
I would never hurt you.
Never again.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.733
I would kill myself first.

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:29.267
Luca! I'm going to the store!
I need you to come with me.

01:25:07.461 --> 01:25:08.461
"Isabel."

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:28.880
Elisa?

01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:32.440
What's the matter?

01:25:32.861 --> 01:25:33.861
Huh?

01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:35.160
The man...

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.467
- What man?
-The man.

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.973
- I don't understand.
-The man!

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:42.920
The man!

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:46.427
- The man!
-What man?

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:49.200
- The man!
-There's a man?

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:50.600
Yes!

01:25:50.728 --> 01:25:51.728
OK...

01:25:57.994 --> 01:25:58.994
Isabel!

01:26:01.994 --> 01:26:02.994
Rocky, no.

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:04.856
No, I don't want it.

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:07.680
Take it.
There's many people around here.

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:28.440
Help!

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.187
Isabel! What happened?

01:29:58.600 --> 01:29:59.933
He hurt Elisa, Mama.

01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:03.680
He hurt the little girl.

01:30:15.728 --> 01:30:17.595
Isabel...

01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:20.253
Why are you here?

01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:26.453
Everything is okay, Elisa.

01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:30.147
Everything is okay.

01:31:05.461 --> 01:31:07.594
OK, somebody get her some water.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.400
Since I was little,
I always loved the name Elisa.

01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:01.787
You have a very beautiful name.

01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:25.440
Is it good?

01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:54.893
Father our thou art in Heaven,
be Thy name hallowed.

01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:59.133
Come Thy kingdom.
Be done thy will...

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:03.920
...on earth as in heaven.
Our daily bread give us today.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.267
Forgive our sins...
