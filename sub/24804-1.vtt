01:10.875 --> 01:12.560
<i>Ya Hafizu.</i>

01:15.000 --> 01:16.520
<i>Ya Hafizu.</i>

01:18.750 --> 01:20.300
<i>Ya Hafizu.</i>

01:22.958 --> 01:26.800
<i>In You I trust above all things.</i>

01:28.917 --> 01:33.080
<i>You are my only protector,
the guardian of my family.</i>

01:34.750 --> 01:37.400
<i>You hear my words. You see me.</i>

01:38.417 --> 01:40.500
<i>You know my secrets.</i>

01:42.708 --> 01:46.660
<i>Ya Hafizu. Answer my prayers.</i>

01:54.125 --> 01:55.660
<i>Ya Hafizu.</i>

01:57.760 --> 01:59.960
<i>Protect me from evil.</i>

03:45.958 --> 03:46.917
Shit.

03:56.220 --> 03:58.000
Shit!

04:02.750 --> 04:03.920
This is great.

04:08.708 --> 04:10.380
It's the axle. It's...

04:11.100 --> 04:12.160
It's broken.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.100
So, is

04:15.917 --> 04:18.240
Well, let's just say
we no longer have a car.

04:19.750 --> 04:21.000
So, now, what?

04:34.750 --> 04:35.750
Fuck!

04:51.667 --> 04:54.250
Come on. Fuck!

04:54.792 --> 04:57.875
I told you that the GPS was wrong.
Now look where we are.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.980
What, we're in a beautiful forest
in Bosnia.

05:05.167 --> 05:07.333
Alex, we are going to miss the plane.

05:08.542 --> 05:09.542
No, because...

05:11.458 --> 05:12.292
Um...

05:14.180 --> 05:17.280
The next town is really not,
not far from here. It's really close.

05:17.833 --> 05:20.500
So all we have to do is we have to
find somebody with a tow-truck

05:20.583 --> 05:23.000
and get them to tow us
to the airport in Sarajevo.

05:25.333 --> 05:26.500
We've got all morning.

05:26.917 --> 05:28.120
We'll get there on time.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.240
It's a piece of cake.

06:03.667 --> 06:07.140
Bad, lazy mutt!

06:07.917 --> 06:12.750
You have been barking all day
so I take you out for a walk, haven't you?

06:13.260 --> 06:14.460
Bad mutt!

06:15.000 --> 06:16.140
Bad mutt!

06:16.240 --> 06:18.000
Come on, come on!

06:33.500 --> 06:35.000
What's the matter?

06:39.750 --> 06:41.600
I'm not going into that forest.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.625
It's dangerous.
There are mines out there, Alex.

06:50.833 --> 06:53.320
Honey, the map says
there are no mines in this area.

06:55.340 --> 06:56.320
Alex...

06:57.417 --> 07:00.250
You think we are in some park in Berlin?

07:00.333 --> 07:01.250
No, but...

07:01.958 --> 07:05.100
All we have to do is walk south
and we'll be fine.

07:08.080 --> 07:08.940
All right, look.

07:10.460 --> 07:12.500
If we don't make it to the next town in...

07:13.260 --> 07:14.280
30 minutes,

07:15.125 --> 07:18.375
I promise you, you'll never have to watch
another Bayern Munich game.

07:20.980 --> 07:22.120
My word.

07:22.958 --> 07:24.083
I give you my word.

07:29.917 --> 07:30.917
Liar. Try me.

08:42.340 --> 08:43.360
Are you ready?

08:49.220 --> 08:50.360
Did you feel that?

08:52.340 --> 08:53.240
What?

09:04.667 --> 09:05.600
Relax!

09:08.917 --> 09:11.880
You know, sometimes I feel like
you love that kamajija necklace

09:12.000 --> 09:13.625
more than you love your boyfriend.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.520
How did you just call it?

09:18.792 --> 09:19.875
What? Jamajija.

09:21.625 --> 09:22.792
<i>Hamajlija.</i>

09:23.083 --> 09:25.320
It's what I said, jamalja.

09:29.180 --> 09:33.240
You know, seeing,
as you have a Bosnian girlfriend,

09:34.125 --> 09:36.542
at least you can learn
some of the language. Huh?

09:36.640 --> 09:38.333
Oh! OK.

09:38.625 --> 09:41.542
That's coming from somebody
who's been living in Berlin for two years

09:41.625 --> 09:44.000
and knows only how to say <i>bitte</i>
and <i>maus,</i> yeah?

09:45.560 --> 09:47.480
Mouse in English, <i>maus</i> in German.

09:48.542 --> 09:49.542
It's easy.

09:51.360 --> 09:52.340
OK, <i>maus.</i>

09:54.792 --> 09:55.900
You'll be safe with me.

09:57.708 --> 09:58.720
I promise.

11:36.250 --> 11:37.580
Yesterday, at the funeral,

11:39.167 --> 11:40.917
they said it helps to talk about it.

11:44.083 --> 11:47.160
- Alex...
- I'm not trying to rush you. It's just...

11:48.250 --> 11:49.820
I want you to know that I'm here for you.

11:50.583 --> 11:51.660
Whenever you want.

11:52.667 --> 11:53.760
I want to understand.

11:55.040 --> 11:57.042
Uh, you know most of it.

11:57.125 --> 12:00.042
Yeah, but sometimes I feel
like you're keeping things from me.

12:00.167 --> 12:01.340
Like your necklace.

12:02.042 --> 12:03.060
Or this forest.

12:03.700 --> 12:06.000
I'd like to know
what they actually mean to you.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.480
Alex, there's something there.

12:27.542 --> 12:28.420
Where?

12:30.625 --> 12:32.542
- Stay here.
- Please don't go. Please.

12:32.625 --> 12:34.375
- Just stay there. Relax.
- I beg you.

12:42.542 --> 12:43.500
Hello?

12:47.250 --> 12:48.250
It's hiding. What is?

12:52.280 --> 12:53.200
Where?

12:53.417 --> 12:55.750
Just there. In that fog.

12:59.750 --> 13:00.760
Fog?

13:02.208 --> 13:03.300
What fog?

13:07.708 --> 13:08.640
Hey!

13:09.667 --> 13:10.875
There's something here.

13:13.667 --> 13:14.580
Alex!

13:15.250 --> 13:16.500
Where are you going?

13:17.958 --> 13:20.240
Just get over here. It's perfectly safe.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.360
What are you doing?

13:48.250 --> 13:51.500
What does it look like I'm doing?
I am trying to get us out of here.

13:51.625 --> 13:52.780
It wasn't locked.

14:07.667 --> 14:08.500
OK!

14:09.792 --> 14:12.300
I see. I knew there'd be something here.

14:13.580 --> 14:16.833
Alex, just... just leave it.
You will get us into trouble, Alex.

14:17.380 --> 14:18.720
Hello

14:20.820 --> 14:21.820
<i>Who's this?</i>

14:22.200 --> 14:25.042
Uh, we need help.
We're, uh, we're stuck in the forest.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.750
We're, we're next to the LADA car.

14:28.042 --> 14:29.042
Can you help us?

14:53.250 --> 14:55.500
You... you talk to them,
they'll understand you.

14:58.083 --> 15:00.680
Selma! Selma, wait!

15:02.917 --> 15:03.875
Selma!

15:05.958 --> 15:06.960
Selma!

15:13.417 --> 15:14.417
Selma! Selma.

15:32.417 --> 15:33.417
Hey!

15:34.160 --> 15:36.620
Hey, hey.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.792
I know this must be really hard for you.

15:46.875 --> 15:48.750
But, baby, I hate seeing you like this.

15:51.042 --> 15:52.750
Did you put the walkie

15:54.792 --> 15:55.792
Yeah.

15:57.042 --> 15:59.750
I'd never do anything to upset you,
you know that.

16:01.583 --> 16:03.792
And you are right.
I should've listened to you.

16:05.320 --> 16:08.020
I promise.
I will be more careful from now on. OK?

16:12.320 --> 16:13.380
And I'm sorry.

16:27.060 --> 16:29.260
My father gave it to me in Srebrenica.

16:33.860 --> 16:37.860
It's...<i>"Ya Hafizu," </i> it's from Quran,
means "Great Protector."

16:42.420 --> 16:44.440
It's like my guardian angel.

16:46.200 --> 16:49.300
Hey, I'm your guardian angel.

16:56.300 --> 16:57.180
Bobby?

16:58.333 --> 16:59.333
Bobby!

17:00.583 --> 17:02.380
- Stay here.
- Please don't go.

17:02.583 --> 17:05.209
- I'll only be a minute.
- Alex, you promised me.

17:05.291 --> 17:06.300
<i>Maus, </i> come on!

17:07.958 --> 17:08.958
Bobby! Bobby!

17:14.208 --> 17:15.180
Bobby!

19:44.708 --> 19:45.708
You...

19:47.542 --> 19:48.940
I think this is ours.

19:50.167 --> 19:52.167
Hi there, sexy?

19:57.125 --> 19:58.240
Are you lost?

19:59.833 --> 20:02.917
Watch your step.
This place is littered with mines.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.840
She doesn't understand shit.

20:08.583 --> 20:09.640
Europe, eh?

20:12.667 --> 20:15.667
Where are you going?
Don't be scared.

20:15.750 --> 20:17.160
Hey, stop!

20:18.380 --> 20:19.333
Hey!

20:19.440 --> 20:21.875
Don't go there! Don't go there!

20:21.958 --> 20:24.240
Listen to me, don't go there!

20:24.542 --> 20:25.667
- Stop...
- Stop!

20:26.792 --> 20:27.958
Stop there, I said!

20:28.042 --> 20:29.520
Alex!
Selma!

20:53.420 --> 20:54.300
Oh.

21:01.833 --> 21:03.125
There's no possible escape.

21:07.083 --> 21:10.917
I'm going to kill you.
Be quiet, be quiet.

21:30.083 --> 21:31.917
Help!

21:32.167 --> 21:34.860
Be quiet, be quiet.

21:56.167 --> 21:57.400
I know that smell.

22:07.833 --> 22:09.100
Welcome home.

22:27.917 --> 22:28.917
Hey.

22:29.333 --> 22:30.440
You OK?

22:31.625 --> 22:32.625
Breathe.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.520
Breathe. That's right. That's right.

22:36.640 --> 22:39.833
<i>Maus,</i> breathe deeply.
Deep breaths, <i>Maus.</i> OK?

22:41.042 --> 22:43.042
You have your guardian angel
watching over.

22:43.125 --> 22:43.958
Come here.

22:47.708 --> 22:49.792
I know. I know, I know.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.625
I know, I know...

22:52.708 --> 22:55.120
We're OK. We're OK.

22:56.040 --> 22:58.440
OK.

22:58.540 --> 23:00.380
We're OK. Yeah.

23:07.380 --> 23:09.000
I'm sorry, but it is dead.

23:10.708 --> 23:11.750
What's he saying?

23:11.833 --> 23:14.083
Shit!
It's dead, my friend. Sorry.

23:14.792 --> 23:16.420
It's better for him, believe me.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.667
"Better"?
- Better, yes.

23:19.750 --> 23:21.000
OK?

23:26.880 --> 23:29.708
Hey! It's my dog, man! What the hell?

23:29.792 --> 23:30.980
Calm down.

23:31.083 --> 23:32.480
That's my dog!

23:32.583 --> 23:33.625
Stop!

23:33.708 --> 23:35.320
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

23:35.458 --> 23:36.720
Don't touch him!

23:40.000 --> 23:41.300
Are you from here?

23:43.792 --> 23:45.760
Tell your boyfriend
it was the only solution.

23:45.860 --> 23:46.860
The dog was dying.

23:46.958 --> 23:48.100
Dog, kaput!

24:29.833 --> 24:30.740
Alex...

24:35.917 --> 24:37.360
let's get out of here.

24:47.180 --> 24:48.600
Alex, we have to go.

24:57.833 --> 25:00.042
And now what do we do?

25:01.458 --> 25:02.458
OK, <i>Maus.</i>

25:03.917 --> 25:05.833
Ask them if they can get us out of here.

25:07.360 --> 25:08.380
Ask them, Selma!

25:10.000 --> 25:10.880
Selma?

25:14.240 --> 25:16.540
Selma, sorry about before.

25:16.875 --> 25:18.180
This forest is full of mines.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.750
But that's why we're here.
For your safety.

25:20.833 --> 25:22.875
It's not necessary.

25:22.958 --> 25:24.833
Right here and now,
you two are our responsibility.

25:24.917 --> 25:27.542
Nothing. They want us to go with them.

25:27.625 --> 25:29.458
Well, tell them we'll go. Yeah?

25:29.542 --> 25:31.740
You can take us to

25:32.708 --> 25:36.380
Selma, anybody who doesn't fear mines
in Bosnia is a dead man walking.

25:37.542 --> 25:39.375
Nothing.

25:39.750 --> 25:43.120
There are almost 8,000 hectares of forest.

25:43.400 --> 25:44.780
- OK.
- Yes.

25:44.875 --> 25:45.875
We are here.

25:46.875 --> 25:48.334
You and us, you and us...

25:48.417 --> 25:52.080
Stop it, fuck's sake!
Can't you see this is serious?

25:53.040 --> 25:54.083
Europe...

25:55.667 --> 25:56.820
This is serious...

25:58.792 --> 26:00.280
The whole place is littered with mines.

26:00.917 --> 26:02.900
Mines... Mine.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
OK.

26:05.958 --> 26:08.750
- Kaput!
- Kaput, yes.

26:08.833 --> 26:10.320
Translate, please.

26:10.417 --> 26:12.208
Mmm-hmm. Alex, listen to me.

26:12.792 --> 26:15.958
I'm not going anywhere
with these two guys.

26:16.042 --> 26:18.833
Can you please stop worrying?
I am handling...

26:18.917 --> 26:20.583
Can you please just listen to me?

26:20.667 --> 26:21.875
Selma...
- Mmm-hmm.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.875
It's been raining.
The earth has moved.

26:24.958 --> 26:26.375
The mines have moved too.

26:27.667 --> 26:29.458
That's no use at all.

26:29.542 --> 26:32.280
You have to come with us.

26:32.375 --> 26:35.500
Alex, we are in trouble.
In real trouble here. OK?

26:35.600 --> 26:38.500
Would you just calm down
and talk to them, huh?

26:38.583 --> 26:40.375
Can you listen to me
what I am saying to you?

26:40.458 --> 26:43.480
I am listening to you!

26:52.400 --> 26:53.400
<i>Maus,</i> what's wrong?

26:56.167 --> 26:57.250
Are you OK?

27:00.917 --> 27:02.760
Listen... Listen...

27:02.860 --> 27:03.959
We are in danger.

27:04.042 --> 27:04.940
Selma!

27:07.042 --> 27:10.240
Selma, what's wrong, baby

27:11.800 --> 27:13.700
Help! Help!

27:13.875 --> 27:15.875
OK. Relax, relax, relax.

27:16.458 --> 27:17.500
Oh, fuck!

27:17.625 --> 27:18.917
What's the matter with her?

27:22.292 --> 27:24.042
Don't!
Be careful, be careful, be careful!

27:25.042 --> 27:28.083
She needs a doctor. OK, relax.
Lie still, baby.

27:28.458 --> 27:30.375
I'm gonna get help. I'm gonna get help.

27:30.583 --> 27:32.958
Relax! Relax, relax.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.620
I'm gonna get you out of here, OK?
Stay there.

27:37.640 --> 27:39.083
Shit! OK.

27:39.620 --> 27:41.917
I'm just gonna go get help, OK?
You stay here.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.417
I'll be back, OK?
I'm gonna get you out of here.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.580
Yeah, we... we have an emergency!

27:51.833 --> 27:53.740
My name is Alex Maschwit, I'm German.

27:57.375 --> 28:00.000
Um, we are lost in a forest
in eastern Bosnia.

28:00.083 --> 28:02.625
My... my girlfriend is badly wounded.
She needs help.

28:05.750 --> 28:09.875
Yes, uh, somewhere near Srebrenica.
West, I think.

28:14.708 --> 28:16.000
No, no, no!

28:16.083 --> 28:17.300
Shit!

28:17.860 --> 28:19.100
Hey, friend!

28:20.600 --> 28:21.875
No, no, no. I got this!

28:21.958 --> 28:25.042
We're going to take her
to our hide-out. Everything will be fine.

28:25.580 --> 28:27.860
Police

28:28.625 --> 28:31.583
What the hell is the matter
with him

28:32.380 --> 28:34.000
I bet you 20 marks the line goes dead.

28:34.083 --> 28:37.875
Trace my call! If I'm calling
it's because I have a fucking emergency!

28:39.583 --> 28:40.583
Hello?

28:41.875 --> 28:43.340
Shit!

28:45.780 --> 28:46.917
Fuck this guy.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.880
What the fuck, man?

28:51.200 --> 28:53.160
Goddamn fucking Bosnians!

28:56.917 --> 28:58.920
We are not Bosnians, my friend.

29:02.360 --> 29:03.620
We are Serbs.

29:10.250 --> 29:13.460
So let the fucking Serbs
help your Bosniak girl.

29:41.833 --> 29:44.360
Can we hurry up, please

29:44.740 --> 29:45.660
Oh!

29:46.083 --> 29:49.920
Europa... Stay on the path!
Stay on the path!

29:50.667 --> 29:52.458
You're gonna blow us all to hell!

29:53.000 --> 29:54.940
What... Are there mines here?

29:56.000 --> 29:57.260
Check your map!

29:58.875 --> 29:59.740
Vuk!

30:00.917 --> 30:02.320
You know what a woman is?

30:03.417 --> 30:04.333
What?

30:05.400 --> 30:07.460
The decoration around her pussy.

30:10.440 --> 30:12.880
Can you please be more careful

30:22.400 --> 30:24.620
Hey! Hey, why are we stopping?

30:26.020 --> 30:26.910
Huh?

30:27.020 --> 30:28.520
Fuck this guy, eh?

30:29.360 --> 30:31.833
Who does he think he is

30:32.000 --> 30:33.708
Guys! This isn't a picnic!

30:34.958 --> 30:36.500
Take it easy, my friend.

30:37.250 --> 30:38.958
Enjoy Bosnia.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.920
Sunshine... Fresh air...

30:42.417 --> 30:44.740
Minefields... Relax.

30:46.875 --> 30:48.000
Our residence.

30:51.890 --> 30:54.220
Uh, wait a minute.

30:55.208 --> 30:56.460
This is your post?

30:57.500 --> 30:59.375
I am not taking my girlfriend in there!

31:01.083 --> 31:02.160
Friend...

31:03.000 --> 31:06.833
We apologize 'cause this is not Hilton.

31:08.083 --> 31:11.240
But you're not
on your fucking honeymoon, OK?

31:23.300 --> 31:24.940
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

31:25.100 --> 31:27.320
Take it easy. Take it easy.

31:30.667 --> 31:32.220
I am on top of everything, OK?

31:32.875 --> 31:35.340
Don't worry. OK?

31:36.060 --> 31:39.042
- OK.
- I'm gonna take care of you. Don't worry.

31:41.792 --> 31:42.625
Remember...

31:44.340 --> 31:45.350
I'm your guardian angel.

31:48.083 --> 31:49.167
Alex!

31:51.833 --> 31:53.520
Alex!

32:05.083 --> 32:06.197
Help!

32:06.280 --> 32:07.792
Scream all you like, nobody can hear you.

32:07.875 --> 32:09.417
Help!

32:14.000 --> 32:16.540
Help!

32:18.625 --> 32:20.340
Help!

32:54.000 --> 32:55.500
Shut up!

32:55.583 --> 32:57.542
Help!

32:57.750 --> 33:00.042
Shut your fucking mouth!
Put her down there.

33:00.125 --> 33:02.083
Help!

33:02.167 --> 33:04.000
Give her it.
Shut up!

33:04.100 --> 33:04.940
No!

33:08.792 --> 33:09.740
Look at her...

33:11.542 --> 33:12.780
This is no time for prayers.

33:13.792 --> 33:16.020
See how she is spoiling our fun?

33:18.080 --> 33:20.440
Princess, this is just the beginning.

33:21.917 --> 33:22.917
Come on.

33:30.708 --> 33:32.320
Let's go from here.

33:36.600 --> 33:40.420
Shut up, you bitch!
Stay still, for God's sake!

33:42.200 --> 33:43.360
Shut up!

33:44.708 --> 33:45.780
Hit her!

33:49.340 --> 33:50.940
We're here.

33:53.200 --> 33:55.180
Say goodbye to daddy.

33:56.833 --> 33:57.792
See you never.

34:10.917 --> 34:12.600
Greet your father.

34:17.580 --> 34:19.860
Go with God.

34:24.833 --> 34:27.280
Say goodbye to daddy.

36:12.230 --> 36:13.490
Hey.

36:16.167 --> 36:17.167
Calm down.

36:29.542 --> 36:30.960
That was just a bad dream.

36:37.833 --> 36:39.640
I have good news and bad news.

36:41.833 --> 36:44.060
The good news
is that you're going to be fine.

36:47.208 --> 36:49.167
The bad news is that we missed the plane.

37:06.917 --> 37:08.280
They dressed the wound.

37:09.917 --> 37:11.060
It's nothing serious.

37:33.042 --> 37:35.140
No, no, no. No, no, no

37:37.520 --> 37:39.280
Don't move. Don't move. Don't move.

37:40.250 --> 37:41.375
Don't move.

37:44.708 --> 37:45.958
We had to bring you down.

37:47.220 --> 37:48.440
For the first aid kit.

37:54.320 --> 37:55.660
I am so glad you're OK.

37:57.875 --> 37:58.940
And don't worry.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.360
I'm here for you.

38:04.875 --> 38:06.000
We're here for you.

38:22.875 --> 38:23.880
Alex...

38:27.667 --> 38:28.720
It's a trap.

38:31.400 --> 38:32.280
Selma.

38:34.833 --> 38:35.740
Selma!

38:42.833 --> 38:43.960
Good morning.

39:05.667 --> 39:06.700
What is that?

39:08.750 --> 39:09.800
Holy water.

39:11.320 --> 39:12.340
Rakia.

39:23.875 --> 39:26.400
Here... Your father liked it.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.958
Hey!

39:32.480 --> 39:35.360
Fuck your Bosnian mother!

39:35.458 --> 39:37.240
Be still, be still!

39:37.860 --> 39:39.875
Shit. Fuck you!

39:40.292 --> 39:41.292
Selma!

39:41.375 --> 39:42.740
Leave me alone!
Let's smoke.

39:43.080 --> 39:44.020
Selma, no!

39:47.667 --> 39:48.500
Selma!

39:55.417 --> 39:56.792
What's the matter with you?

39:59.160 --> 40:00.700
Have you gone completely nuts?

40:05.583 --> 40:08.917
Do you realize what would have happened
if you had actually used this, huh?

40:15.917 --> 40:17.920
Jesus Christ, Selma,
they're just trying to help.

40:18.020 --> 40:18.920
Help?

40:19.880 --> 40:22.542
Scum like them killed my whole family!

40:22.680 --> 40:25.397
The war is over!
Not all Serbs are bad people!

40:25.480 --> 40:27.625
Yeah, sure! You're so naive!

40:27.708 --> 40:29.120
And you're paranoid!

40:49.875 --> 40:51.080
Don't ever...

40:52.833 --> 40:54.220
do that to me again.

40:57.000 --> 40:57.880
Ever.

41:00.625 --> 41:01.620
You understand?

41:08.080 --> 41:10.167
You'll end up getting us both killed.

41:15.875 --> 41:17.440
You got us into this.

41:19.280 --> 41:22.080
Now do something to get us out of here.

42:23.680 --> 42:25.417
Um, guys...

42:27.370 --> 42:28.280
Um...

42:29.583 --> 42:32.020
I'm really sorry about what just happened.

42:33.708 --> 42:35.833
My girlfriend, you know, she's...

42:36.833 --> 42:38.640
under a lot of stress.

42:38.940 --> 42:42.375
OK. Her parents and her brother. They...

42:42.458 --> 42:43.340
They were, uh...

42:44.400 --> 42:45.740
Well, they were killed.

42:46.500 --> 42:47.500
They disappeared...

42:48.500 --> 42:51.180
in this area during the war. Um...

42:52.440 --> 42:56.100
And their remains
just turned up a month ago,

42:56.208 --> 42:58.720
in a mass grave,
you know, after those floods.

42:59.917 --> 43:03.833
And yesterday we buried them
in Srebrenica. So...

43:05.042 --> 43:08.320
I guess you can see why
she's in such a nervous state, I mean...

43:09.070 --> 43:12.100
I keep trying to get her
to move on, but, uh...

43:16.320 --> 43:18.875
Anyway, I'm... I'm really sorry.

43:19.380 --> 43:20.500
Truly, I am.

43:21.940 --> 43:24.360
It's OK, my friend. I... I understand.

43:25.750 --> 43:28.875
It's a... Bosniak thing.

43:30.542 --> 43:31.667
Yeah, right?

43:35.083 --> 43:37.720
I mean, they are, uh...
They are complicated, you know?

43:39.583 --> 43:43.480
She never even told me that she lived
through the war as a child, you know?

43:44.750 --> 43:47.333
And we've been seeing each other
for a year, I mean...

43:47.417 --> 43:48.480
It's crazy, right?

43:49.750 --> 43:51.120
Welcome to Bosnia.

43:55.500 --> 43:57.417
What is he laughing about?

43:57.500 --> 44:00.042
Leave him, he's a nice guy.

44:14.792 --> 44:15.820
Thank you.

44:28.750 --> 44:29.700
Thank you.

44:32.375 --> 44:33.458
Hmm.

44:35.792 --> 44:36.720
Thanks.

44:45.333 --> 44:47.042
I like you, my friend.

44:48.625 --> 44:50.140
You are a really nice European.

44:55.708 --> 44:58.708
It's a pity I don't feel the same
for your woman.

44:59.792 --> 45:00.640
Sorry.

45:05.667 --> 45:06.583
Uh...

45:10.667 --> 45:11.660
Anyway...

45:14.125 --> 45:17.417
I really appreciate all your help
and all you've done for us.

45:18.210 --> 45:21.375
Uh... Oh!
And if there's ever anything you need...

45:22.667 --> 45:24.060
You know, here's my, uh...

45:25.625 --> 45:27.040
Here's my... my card.

45:27.875 --> 45:28.792
You know.

45:29.320 --> 45:30.280
Sorry.

45:31.000 --> 45:31.833
Um...

45:32.100 --> 45:33.360
And that's my email.

45:34.520 --> 45:35.560
So...

45:39.120 --> 45:42.583
But right now, I think it's best
if we, if we separate, you know.

45:43.750 --> 45:47.833
My girlfriend will feel more comfortable
if we continue on our own.

45:49.625 --> 45:50.625
So, um...

45:57.708 --> 45:58.760
If that's OK?

46:03.260 --> 46:04.280
Thank you.

46:20.958 --> 46:22.060
Hey, man...

46:23.458 --> 46:25.875
I don't want any problems, man.
We just want to go home.

46:26.417 --> 46:29.708
Luckily for you,
that's what we're here for.

46:30.250 --> 46:32.542
Remember the area is full of mines.

46:34.875 --> 46:36.880
Look, you go down the road...

46:38.958 --> 46:40.420
a mile or so.

46:41.000 --> 46:44.875
Follow the signs, left and right.

46:44.958 --> 46:48.480
Do not stray
or you will enter a minefield.

46:48.708 --> 46:50.820
You get to the mountain and you go...

46:51.833 --> 46:54.160
about 800 or 900 meters uphill.

46:54.625 --> 46:57.625
You will see a small bridge.

46:58.042 --> 46:59.125
You cross it and...

46:59.750 --> 47:02.792
Sorry. Sorry. I forgot...

47:04.958 --> 47:06.920
Ten thousand euros for the...

47:08.000 --> 47:10.240
simultaneous translation.

47:16.260 --> 47:17.200
Excuse me?

47:18.280 --> 47:22.792
You heard me, my friend.
Ten thousand euros and we're OK, huh?

47:26.708 --> 47:28.320
Is this some kind of joke?

47:30.833 --> 47:33.640
The mountain rescue work
costs money, you know?

47:33.750 --> 47:34.667
Uh...

47:35.458 --> 47:36.340
The recession...

47:37.300 --> 47:39.400
The economic crisis...

47:40.375 --> 47:41.500
We have to live.

47:45.280 --> 47:46.540
Of course, yeah.

47:49.180 --> 47:50.280
Well, um...

47:51.140 --> 47:52.260
Don't worry about it.

47:52.710 --> 47:55.500
We'll have to try
and work it out ourselves.

47:57.000 --> 47:57.875
So...

47:59.958 --> 48:01.417
Thanks for all the help, guys.

48:21.625 --> 48:23.200
Please, my friend...

48:24.125 --> 48:26.125
Just pay...

48:27.420 --> 48:29.060
and everything is OK.

48:30.917 --> 48:32.280
I'm a little bit upset.

48:39.667 --> 48:40.900
You fucking bastards!

48:43.080 --> 48:45.340
Let's not make things complicated, OK?

48:46.240 --> 48:47.073
OK?

48:58.792 --> 49:01.583
Be wise and nothing will happen to you.

49:05.208 --> 49:07.375
Run! Run!

49:08.333 --> 49:11.000
What's the matter, German bitch?

50:54.750 --> 50:56.125
<i>Ya Hafizu.</i>

50:57.958 --> 50:59.708
<i>Ya Hafizu.</i>

51:03.460 --> 51:04.740
<i>Ya Hafizu.</i>

51:07.125 --> 51:08.640
<i>Ya Hafizu.</i>

51:50.880 --> 51:51.900
Selma...

52:07.167 --> 52:09.375
You haven't been very nice to me.

52:14.200 --> 52:15.320
It doesn't matter.

52:22.708 --> 52:23.708
I forgive you.

52:37.440 --> 52:39.708
Fuck your dead family!

52:39.958 --> 52:43.080
Fuck your Bosnian mother!

52:46.000 --> 52:48.340
Fuck you, bitch!

54:16.360 --> 54:18.220
<i>Ya Hafizu.</i>

54:21.280 --> 54:23.060
<i>Ya Hafizu.</i>

54:25.180 --> 54:27.120
<i>Ya Hafizu.</i>

55:11.792 --> 55:13.792
Where is Milos?

55:18.083 --> 55:19.375
You're not going to escape.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.040
Milos!

55:26.440 --> 55:27.420
Milos!

55:30.792 --> 55:34.020
Answer me. Where is Milos?

55:39.040 --> 55:40.200
Kaput.

55:52.667 --> 55:54.417
I'm a little disappointed, you know?

55:54.500 --> 55:56.792
I thought you would defend yourself.

55:58.100 --> 55:59.460
But you are all the same.

55:59.750 --> 56:01.708
You like being victims, don't you?

56:02.280 --> 56:03.440
Hey, little mouse?

56:04.500 --> 56:06.260
Has the cat got your tongue?

56:10.167 --> 56:12.500
But that doesn't mean we're not going
to enjoy ourselves for a while.

56:27.625 --> 56:30.340
Five... Four...

56:30.687 --> 56:31.740
Run, mouse!

56:32.100 --> 56:34.780
Three... Two... One... Now!

56:35.500 --> 56:38.000
Don't you want to play?
We're going to play a little!

56:43.000 --> 56:44.560
Stay still, mouse!

57:39.240 --> 57:40.520
I'll find you.

57:47.333 --> 57:48.860
You can't hide!

58:03.840 --> 58:04.880
Little mouse!

58:06.542 --> 58:07.780
Little mouse!

58:19.958 --> 58:20.958
Hey!

58:56.120 --> 58:57.440
Where have you got to?

58:58.708 --> 59:00.792
When I'm finished with you,
I'll go and play with Europe.

59:09.625 --> 59:10.580
Selma!

59:15.583 --> 59:16.600
Little mouse!

59:22.708 --> 59:25.180
I'm going to bury you so deep,
no one will know you even existed.

01:01:48.667 --> 01:01:49.560
Alex...

01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.200
Alex?

01:02:01.917 --> 01:02:02.880
Alex!

01:02:12.833 --> 01:02:14.060
Are you OK?

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.690
Go...

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.270
No...

01:02:18.417 --> 01:02:21.400
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK,
it's OK, come.

01:02:21.708 --> 01:02:23.580
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:28.333
You've to get away
before, before they come back.

01:02:28.417 --> 01:02:31.140
Baby, listen to me!
They are dead both of them!

01:02:40.042 --> 01:02:41.500
Yeah.

01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:44.260
Yeah.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.140
It's over.

01:02:47.792 --> 01:02:49.620
We're safe! You're safe!

01:06:55.875 --> 01:06:56.840
Alex...

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:14.958
You said you wanted to understand me.

01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:19.380
Didn't you?

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:31.750
You can't even imagine
what they did to my family. Just...

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.920
Just because we are Muslims.

01:07:46.458 --> 01:07:47.660
You know when I was...

01:07:48.708 --> 01:07:49.625
a child...

01:07:52.083 --> 01:07:53.660
they told me to scream?

01:07:55.625 --> 01:07:57.320
Because somebody will come to help.

01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:10.580
Did you hear me scream?

01:08:19.979 --> 01:08:20.957
Did you?

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:27.260
Where were you?

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.042
Huh?

01:08:37.667 --> 01:08:38.680
Where were you?

01:10:01.583 --> 01:10:02.542
What?

01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:07.333
<i>Hamajlija.</i>

01:10:09.875 --> 01:10:10.880
Selma!

01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:15.750
Selma!

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:16.153
Ah!

01:14:18.792 --> 01:14:20.620
Get out of my way, Alex.

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.020
Baby...

01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:29.220
put the gun down.

01:14:31.625 --> 01:14:32.600
It's over.

01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:36.860
Do you hear me?

01:14:38.042 --> 01:14:41.083
Get out of my way.

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:44.020
Listen to me.

01:14:45.833 --> 01:14:47.958
We are going to turn him over
to the police.

01:14:50.625 --> 01:14:51.958
Take a good look at him.

01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:56.240
That man can no longer hurt us.

01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:05.160
<i>Maus?</i>

01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:08.800
You're the woman of my life.

01:15:11.333 --> 01:15:13.100
And I want to go home.

01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:16.780
I wanna go home with you.

01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:21.600
But if you fire that gun...

01:15:24.208 --> 01:15:25.860
if you pull that trigger...

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:32.080
I can't. I just can't.

01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:39.220
That's not who I am.

01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:52.280
Please. Please!

01:17:49.708 --> 01:17:51.660
We have to move him with the stretcher.

01:17:55.917 --> 01:17:56.940
<i>Maus...</i>

01:17:59.292 --> 01:18:00.708
we're doing the right thing.

01:18:02.708 --> 01:18:03.720
Trust me.

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:08.620
I'll be right back.

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.160
Little mouse...

01:18:50.875 --> 01:18:53.458
Maybe it was me who killed your family.

01:20:37.208 --> 01:20:38.417
It's OK.

01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:05.320
Alex...

01:21:10.667 --> 01:21:11.640
Please...

01:21:15.083 --> 01:21:18.208
I just... I had to do it.

01:21:28.708 --> 01:21:29.720
Alex.

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:36.780
Alex, please!

01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:40.080
Don't go.

01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:44.600
Please, I beg you.

01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:48.120
Please... Alex!

01:21:48.625 --> 01:21:49.458
<i>Maus!</i>

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.040
Hey!

01:24:53.583 --> 01:24:56.460
- I thought you wouldn't come.
- Sorry, I'm late.

01:24:59.208 --> 01:25:01.917
You know, my friends are gonna think
you don't like them.

01:25:02.333 --> 01:25:03.583
You know that's not true.

01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:05.980
I know. I forgive you.

01:25:06.542 --> 01:25:08.640
But only if you help me grab the beers.

01:25:09.708 --> 01:25:10.840
Sure. Where are they?

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.500
Julian's got them in the car.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.208
You want to come with me?

01:25:14.458 --> 01:25:16.583
No, you stay here with the guys.
I'll... I'll get them.

01:25:16.667 --> 01:25:18.040
Of course.

01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:22.020
OK. I'm so happy you came.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.040
We're gonna have fun.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:30.958
Trust me.

01:25:32.708 --> 01:25:34.120
- See you in a bit.
- OK.

01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:57.260
Hello, Jule

01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:05.280
Yes, I just got here.

01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:08.280
Is Billy there too?

01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:11.083
Where are you?

01:26:13.792 --> 01:26:15.500
OK, I'll be there in just a minute.

01:26:15.625 --> 01:26:16.600
Ciao!
