SO, IF THERE ARE DIFFERENT
VERSIONS OF YOURSELF

40:11.910 --> 40:14.045
FLOATING AROUND
INSIDE YOUR SKULL,

40:14.079 --> 40:16.247
WHICH ONE IS THE REAL YOU?

40:17.949 --> 40:23.054
ARE YOU THE LEAD GUITARIST,
ROCKING OUT ONCE A WEEK?

40:23.088 --> 40:26.091
OR IS IT YOUR 9:00-TO-5:00

40:26.124 --> 40:29.127
THAT TRULY DEFINES YOU?

40:31.129 --> 40:34.299
CAN ONE OF THOSE SELVES
BE A DEVOTED SPOUSE...

40:36.267 --> 40:41.072
...AND THE OTHER A LYING,
THIEVING, OUT-OF-CONTROL ADDICT?

40:41.106 --> 40:42.941
CAN YOU LONG FOR LOVE

40:42.974 --> 40:45.977
AND YET STILL BE CURSED
BY GENETICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT

40:46.011 --> 40:50.916
AND REMAIN THE SAME SON
OF A [BLEEP] YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN?

40:50.949 --> 40:54.019
AND EVEN IF YOU DO CHANGE
SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF...

40:56.254 --> 40:58.957
...YOUR FACE...

40:58.990 --> 41:01.192
YOUR NAME...

41:01.226 --> 41:04.129
WHERE YOU LIVE...

41:22.147 --> 41:27.318
...CAN YOU EVER ACTUALLY CHANGE
WHO YOU REALLY ARE?
