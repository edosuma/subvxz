- Mommy! Mommy!
- Mom!

01:13.138 --> 01:15.774
Get out of here! My babies!

01:17.742 --> 01:20.610
David, hurry!

01:20.612 --> 01:22.345
David!

02:02.855 --> 02:05.689
<i>Tower,
Coast Guard helicopter 362.</i>

02:05.691 --> 02:07.558
<i>One and two, prepare.
One and two.</i>

02:07.560 --> 02:09.893
<i>One VIP pass aboard.</i>

02:09.895 --> 02:12.328
<i>Coast Guard flight,
cleared as requested.</i>

02:30.481 --> 02:33.784
Evening, Lieutenant.
Lydia Clarkson, Atlanta field.

02:33.786 --> 02:35.285
Good evening, ma'am.

02:35.287 --> 02:37.387
Lieutenant Pauls.
Welcome to Jacksonville.

02:50.002 --> 02:52.805
God only knows what the hell
happened out there.

02:53.538 --> 02:55.875
Let's find out.

02:57.408 --> 03:00.679
- Mrs. Greer. Thank you.
- Ma'am.

03:02.747 --> 03:05.482
I'm Special Agent
Lydia Clarkson.

03:05.484 --> 03:07.883
I'm going to be handling
your case from here on in.

03:07.885 --> 03:09.855
They needed some help.

03:14.393 --> 03:16.692
I see medical already
checked you out.

03:16.694 --> 03:19.630
And besides some bruises
and dehydration,

03:19.632 --> 03:20.998
seems you're in
remarkable condition.

03:21.000 --> 03:21.967
My girls.

03:23.534 --> 03:26.269
Yes, your... your daughters,
they're fine.

03:26.271 --> 03:27.671
And they're here
right on the Coast Guard base.

03:27.673 --> 03:29.439
Yes, I know that,
but I want to see them.

03:29.441 --> 03:30.941
You have to help me get to them.

03:30.943 --> 03:33.410
I will.

03:33.412 --> 03:36.812
I just need you
to compromise with me

03:36.814 --> 03:38.850
and tell me what happened
on the boat.

03:40.019 --> 03:43.855
We can start by telling me what
is the last thing you remember?

03:46.824 --> 03:48.260
Sarah?

03:55.967 --> 03:57.834
How did you end up
floating on debris

03:57.836 --> 04:00.406
in the middle of open channels?

04:01.606 --> 04:03.376
Sarah?

04:04.409 --> 04:06.346
David.

04:10.848 --> 04:13.418
He tried to fight it, but...

04:15.054 --> 04:17.624
...in the end, he couldn't.

04:21.459 --> 04:23.629
So I put her
on the bottom of the sea.

04:24.362 --> 04:26.596
Why haven't you told anybody
this before?

04:26.598 --> 04:28.768
Because they wouldn't
believe me.

04:31.836 --> 04:33.437
And neither will you.

04:33.439 --> 04:37.343
Talk to me.
What happened?

04:39.944 --> 04:44.850
Evil needs a body to exist.

04:49.053 --> 04:50.889
The body was that boat.

04:56.427 --> 04:58.127
<i>Center Jacksonville,
this is Marlin.</i>

04:58.129 --> 05:00.964
<i>We are on sea with what appears
to be an abandoned vessel.</i>

05:00.966 --> 05:02.765
<i>Marlin, Roger.</i>

05:02.767 --> 05:04.901
<i>Request vessel description
and persons on board.</i>

05:04.903 --> 05:07.536
<i>Center, no activity
or visible persons aboard.</i>

05:07.538 --> 05:09.406
<i>Vessel is a sailboat,</i>

05:09.408 --> 05:11.942
<i>shows signs of damage
due to prolonged time at sea.</i>

05:11.944 --> 05:16.512
<i>Name of vessel is</i> Mary...
<i>Mike-Alpha-Romeo-Yankee.</i>

05:16.514 --> 05:18.548
<i>Launching boarding team
to investigate.</i>

05:18.550 --> 05:19.882
<i>Marlin, Roger.</i>

05:19.884 --> 05:22.087
<i>All standing by
for boarding update.</i>

05:41.139 --> 05:44.440
<i>Boarding team,
this is Marlin, over.</i>

05:44.442 --> 05:47.512
Marlin, Marlin One,
boarding sailing vessel <i>Mary.</i>

07:11.497 --> 07:12.661
Clear.

07:25.076 --> 07:27.243
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Captain.

07:27.245 --> 07:30.079
- Thank you.
- Hi.

07:30.081 --> 07:32.248
- You have a good time?
- It was great, thanks.

07:32.250 --> 07:35.685
Hey, Brian, that's a nice red.

07:35.687 --> 07:37.120
- Hey, Tommy!
- Yeah?

07:37.122 --> 07:39.891
- Fillet Brian's red, will ya?
- Yeah.

07:40.658 --> 07:42.925
He's the best captain
in Florida.

07:42.927 --> 07:45.031
I've got this guy, David Greer.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.664
Of course he'll work
on the holidays.

07:48.666 --> 07:50.834
He's my guy.
He'll bust his ass for you.

08:27.105 --> 08:29.706
There be our future charter,
sire.

08:29.708 --> 08:32.177
Come on,
opening bid starts in 10.

09:35.273 --> 09:37.143
Beautiful specimen.

09:41.245 --> 09:42.981
German-built.

09:44.216 --> 09:46.851
36 tons.

09:47.852 --> 09:49.219
You know your ships.

09:49.221 --> 09:51.256
My father had one for years.

09:52.190 --> 09:54.961
Ketch was the first boat
I ever set foot on.

09:57.828 --> 10:01.132
Makes me feel like a kid
just looking at her.

10:04.201 --> 10:06.806
They don't make them
like this anymore.

10:10.307 --> 10:12.244
She has a soul.

10:13.678 --> 10:18.216
Indeed. Just needs to find
her captain.

10:21.385 --> 10:23.420
<i>The forecast, plenty
of sunshine through today</i>

10:23.422 --> 10:25.121
<i>with seasonal temperatures.</i>

10:25.123 --> 10:27.690
<i>We should reach our normal high
of 82 degrees</i>

10:27.692 --> 10:28.724
<i>by this afternoon.</i>

10:28.726 --> 10:30.759
Mary!

10:30.761 --> 10:34.966
Mary Greer, get out here and
help your sister set the table.

10:36.368 --> 10:39.835
I want a tattoo.
Tommy said it didn't hurt.

10:39.837 --> 10:42.004
Tommy has mutilated
enough of his body.

10:42.006 --> 10:43.440
It's all numb to him.

10:43.442 --> 10:46.142
Mommy, it feels weird.

10:46.144 --> 10:49.179
You know the drill, Crab Cakes.
You gotta stop wiggling it.

10:49.181 --> 10:51.013
It'll come out when it's ready.

10:51.015 --> 10:52.715
But I want it out now.

10:54.251 --> 10:56.888
Go, go, go help your sister.

10:58.190 --> 11:01.994
Hey. Hey.
How'd the Resmo look?

11:16.140 --> 11:17.676
So cool!

11:21.011 --> 11:22.981
Seriously?

11:29.153 --> 11:31.057
Surprise.

11:40.298 --> 11:42.100
Mary?

11:43.434 --> 11:45.368
That's my name.

11:45.370 --> 11:49.442
And her name is Mary!
How more perfect can that get?

11:52.910 --> 11:56.045
David, you told me were
just gonna take a look,

11:56.047 --> 11:58.117
and that was supposed to be
the Resmondo.

11:58.850 --> 12:02.417
I, uh, had to make a choice.

12:02.419 --> 12:06.355
Got some distress, but she's
pretty healthy for an old gal.

12:06.357 --> 12:09.360
- Smells like dog poop.
- That's rotten wood.

12:10.427 --> 12:12.896
It even has some ramshackle
on the deck, see?

12:12.898 --> 12:15.799
- What's that?
- Bits and pieces of other ships.

12:15.801 --> 12:17.036
Even older.

12:18.202 --> 12:22.204
This is the find of a lifetime.

12:22.206 --> 12:24.541
- It's special.
- Okay.

12:24.543 --> 12:27.844
And how are we even
supposed to come up

12:27.846 --> 12:30.014
with the other 180,
minus the deposit?

12:31.115 --> 12:33.949
We sell the cars
and we go from there.

12:33.951 --> 12:36.286
Mike said he will come in
as a side partner for 20.

12:36.288 --> 12:37.587
Mike is supposed to stop you

12:37.589 --> 12:39.922
from doing something stupid
like this.

12:39.924 --> 12:42.160
David! David!

12:43.528 --> 12:46.930
- We have to be practical.
- Practical?

12:46.932 --> 12:49.098
Sarah, God knows we've been
through the mill this year,

12:49.100 --> 12:51.066
and I am not getting
any younger.

12:51.068 --> 12:54.205
I need to captain my own boat.

12:55.139 --> 12:57.206
It's the only way to get ahead.

12:57.208 --> 13:02.845
I can't work for Jay's scraps
for the rest of my life.

13:02.847 --> 13:07.382
We can fix up the hull
and make this a family cruiser,

13:07.384 --> 13:09.352
take people anywhere
they wanna go.

13:09.354 --> 13:12.121
And even better,
it comes with a story.

13:12.123 --> 13:14.257
Set sail on the mysterious
<i>Mary Gail,</i> found...

13:14.259 --> 13:16.059
We were supposed to have
a fishing boat,

13:16.061 --> 13:17.562
not a goddamn tourist trap!

13:20.865 --> 13:24.099
Mary has to go to the bathroom.
Does the head work?

13:24.101 --> 13:26.069
I don't know, baby.
That's an outstanding question.

13:26.071 --> 13:28.338
- David, does the head work?
- No.

13:28.340 --> 13:31.140
Marina's closest.

13:31.142 --> 13:33.943
I'll go. I need some fresh air.
It's hot as hell in here.

13:33.945 --> 13:36.378
Okay. There are spiders, too,
just so you know that.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.884
Yeah, sure we paid extra
for those.

14:25.096 --> 14:27.997
Lindsey, look!

14:27.999 --> 14:29.368
What are you doing?

14:30.268 --> 14:33.036
Look what I can do!

14:33.038 --> 14:34.874
Mary.

14:40.144 --> 14:43.081
It's $260 with the work.

14:43.948 --> 14:45.949
We'll never turn a profit
in the first two years.

14:45.951 --> 14:49.118
Yeah, and it'll take a miracle
to renovate her hull.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.288
I know.

14:52.123 --> 14:53.993
Look, I'm sorry.

14:54.625 --> 14:57.528
I, uh... I should have
called you first.

14:58.996 --> 15:04.132
But there was, I don't know,
something about her.

15:04.134 --> 15:05.535
I can't... I can't explain it.

15:05.537 --> 15:08.171
I was just...
I was just drawn to her.

15:08.173 --> 15:10.506
Why?
It's a 50-year-old ketch

15:10.508 --> 15:12.474
with a siren bust,
and it needs work.

15:12.476 --> 15:13.411
So do we.

15:17.215 --> 15:21.584
I-I just thought
that this was something

15:21.586 --> 15:25.588
that we could finally make ours.

15:25.590 --> 15:30.158
You know, something that could
take us to a better place.

15:30.160 --> 15:31.062
I'm sorry.

15:32.364 --> 15:34.166
No, David, stop. No.

15:36.301 --> 15:39.571
Please don't ask
for my forgiveness.

15:41.239 --> 15:43.605
I'm the one
that needs forgiving.

15:43.607 --> 15:45.209
I'm the idiot.

15:48.013 --> 15:49.212
Please forgive me.

15:49.214 --> 15:50.416
I do.

15:52.484 --> 15:55.721
I have. Okay?

15:56.520 --> 16:00.623
And you're right. It's a...
It's a hunk of an old ship.

16:00.625 --> 16:02.791
There's something about it
that feels right.

16:02.793 --> 16:05.395
It feels like us again.

16:05.397 --> 16:09.100
In this boat, I see our future.

16:09.634 --> 16:12.634
A future with a rusted hull

16:12.636 --> 16:15.204
and torn sails
and a clogged toilet.

16:15.206 --> 16:18.576
And spiders.
Don't forget the spiders.

16:19.344 --> 16:21.213
So when do we launch?

16:27.485 --> 16:29.355
Oh, God.

16:30.254 --> 16:32.624
What have you got us into?

16:49.706 --> 16:51.143
Hey!

17:36.253 --> 17:37.819
- You ready?
- Yeah!

17:37.821 --> 17:40.458
- Mary, you ready?
- Yeah!

17:49.433 --> 17:51.334
Okay, rabbit goes
through the hole.

17:51.336 --> 17:52.567
- Yup.
- Around the tree.

17:52.569 --> 17:55.307
Mm-hmm.
- Out of the hole.

17:56.173 --> 17:59.577
And then... this way?

18:00.345 --> 18:02.311
No? I know.
I felt...

18:02.313 --> 18:03.513
Takes some practice.

18:03.515 --> 18:05.350
No shit.

18:14.259 --> 18:17.759
Clear 220 to Abaco.

18:17.761 --> 18:22.731
Make the turn at Harold's Cay
at around 14 knots

18:22.733 --> 18:26.835
and then full sailing
into Hamilton.

18:26.837 --> 18:30.506
Abaco to Bermuda,
hell of a final stretch, Cap.

18:30.508 --> 18:33.308
You know, it's all blue, and
we'll have the wind at our back,

18:33.310 --> 18:35.210
- inboard on reserve.
- All right.

18:35.212 --> 18:38.613
Okay, official family test run.

18:38.615 --> 18:42.485
6:00 a.m., all hands on deck.

18:42.487 --> 18:44.487
Aye-aye, Captain!

18:46.223 --> 18:48.790
Argh, treading
thee cursed waters

18:48.792 --> 18:51.727
of the Devil's Triangle
on a right ghost ship.

18:51.729 --> 18:53.328
Jay, put down that Cuervo

18:53.330 --> 18:55.331
and quit scaring my young'un
to death.

18:55.333 --> 18:58.301
I'm not scared, Mommy.
I think it's cool.

18:58.303 --> 19:01.237
- And she has my name.
- Yeah, who was Mary anyway?

19:01.239 --> 19:03.206
It's undetermined.

19:03.208 --> 19:05.307
Last owner was William Sanfree.

19:05.309 --> 19:07.543
He was a naval officer
from Georgia.

19:07.545 --> 19:09.344
Plan was to travel the world.

19:09.346 --> 19:13.382
And instead,
the ship turned up empty.

19:13.384 --> 19:15.517
Everybody missing
in the high seas.

19:15.519 --> 19:17.786
I'd hate to lose a good captain.

19:17.788 --> 19:20.288
If I were you,
I would double-check

19:20.290 --> 19:22.557
all those Coast Guard
salvage reports.

19:22.559 --> 19:24.860
Yeah, well, those reports,
they all checked out.

19:24.862 --> 19:26.461
Don't mean they're right.

19:26.463 --> 19:29.966
In these very waters,
there's a dozen ships

19:29.968 --> 19:32.767
was just found floating
all by their lonesome.

19:32.769 --> 19:36.338
No crew, no evidence of piracy,
nothing.

19:36.340 --> 19:38.240
You ever wonder what happened
to those people?

19:38.242 --> 19:39.507
Yeah, well,
there's always gonna be

19:39.509 --> 19:41.509
a mystery or two behind a ship.

19:41.511 --> 19:43.679
It adds to the spirit.

19:43.681 --> 19:48.284
Oh, heck, ghost ship or not,
it's a beautiful gal

19:48.286 --> 19:49.788
with a beautiful name.

19:51.256 --> 19:52.822
Here's to Captain David Greer,

19:52.824 --> 19:57.593
best helmsman I ever had
on one of my two-bit boats.

19:57.595 --> 19:58.893
How about a speech, Cap?

19:58.895 --> 20:00.328
- No!
- Yeah!

20:08.806 --> 20:10.808
All right!

20:13.510 --> 20:16.978
To friends and shipmates.

20:16.980 --> 20:19.949
Mike, without your help
and support,

20:19.951 --> 20:22.684
I couldn't have pulled this off.

20:22.686 --> 20:25.988
To my beautiful wife,

20:25.990 --> 20:29.292
who was a fine
fisherman's daughter,

20:29.294 --> 20:32.628
who has sacrificed a great deal

20:32.630 --> 20:34.963
to raise our two
beautiful girls,

20:34.965 --> 20:39.003
all of whom I love and cherish
every day of my life.

20:40.038 --> 20:42.406
Endless horizons...

20:49.380 --> 20:50.983
Dad?

20:55.853 --> 20:57.753
Um...

20:57.755 --> 21:01.457
Endless horizons
and new beginnings.

21:01.459 --> 21:02.857
- New beginnings.
- New beginnings.

21:02.859 --> 21:04.660
I'll drink to that!

21:04.662 --> 21:08.963
Okay, it's time. Come on.
Get over here, come on, photo!

21:08.965 --> 21:10.498
Tommy should get
in the photo, too.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.567
You and Tommy
have six billion selfies.

21:12.569 --> 21:13.869
You can take one family photo.

21:13.871 --> 21:14.536
- I know.
- You press that, I guess.

21:14.538 --> 21:16.671
Okay, good, don't screw up.

21:16.673 --> 21:18.540
All right, count of three.

21:18.542 --> 21:20.575
- Everyone say "Mary".
- Mary!

21:20.577 --> 21:21.443
- Mary!
- Mary!

21:21.445 --> 21:23.746
Three, two, one.

21:23.748 --> 21:24.979
Mary!

21:26.483 --> 21:27.949
Uh-oh, somebody check
that boy's I.D.

21:27.951 --> 21:29.954
You just dropped my phone.

21:32.356 --> 21:34.356
Yeah, hey, it's cool.

21:34.358 --> 21:37.125
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:37.127 --> 21:38.663
Sorry.

21:40.530 --> 21:42.131
Aw, look at that.

21:42.133 --> 21:43.869
I want to see.

21:49.539 --> 21:52.074
Sirens call the ships
out to sea.

21:52.076 --> 21:53.742
She's supposed to be good luck.

21:53.744 --> 21:55.813
And of course
she has to be half-naked.

21:58.782 --> 22:01.719
Nice siren, Tommy.
Wrap it up.

22:21.038 --> 22:25.141
♪ Let the waves crash over you ♪

22:25.143 --> 22:29.612
♪ Let the waves crash over you ♪

22:29.614 --> 22:33.085
♪ Let them send you out to sea ♪

22:34.050 --> 22:36.751
♪ You're safely out to sea ♪

22:54.105 --> 22:56.671
You hungover
from the margaritas?

22:56.673 --> 23:00.976
No, I'm just... I don't know.

23:00.978 --> 23:02.447
Nervous?

23:03.181 --> 23:05.080
Yeah, maybe.

23:05.082 --> 23:06.651
Me, too.

23:07.551 --> 23:10.084
Mike and Tommy
are already topside.

23:10.086 --> 23:12.621
We're gonna have to
watch that kid.

23:12.623 --> 23:15.824
He thinks he can reel in our
daughter with those cheap tats.

23:15.826 --> 23:17.726
Yours worked on me.

23:17.728 --> 23:22.631
You know, Jay thinks that
the wood on the siren bow,

23:22.633 --> 23:24.999
it dates back over 300 years.

23:25.001 --> 23:28.170
- Wow.
- I mean, wow, what a find.

23:28.172 --> 23:33.107
Greeks thought sirens were
just demons in disguise.

23:33.109 --> 23:35.611
And the ships are at
their beck and call.

23:35.613 --> 23:37.513
I'm less worried about demons

23:37.515 --> 23:41.052
and more worried about
that shitty loan rate.

23:43.086 --> 23:46.625
It's gonna be okay.
I feel it.

23:52.896 --> 23:55.099
I just want to make you proud.

23:56.634 --> 23:58.537
I am proud.

24:00.003 --> 24:01.673
You're the captain.

24:04.909 --> 24:07.078
You're my captain.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.651
Are you sure about that?

24:13.951 --> 24:16.688
- Yes.
- Nothing in the rearview?

24:19.289 --> 24:20.724
No.

24:22.192 --> 24:24.562
No, it's just us now.

24:29.165 --> 24:31.569
Clear sailing.

24:34.137 --> 24:36.607
- Clear sailing.
- Yes.

24:40.144 --> 24:41.776
- Aah!
- Gotcha!

24:46.884 --> 24:50.020
Hey, let her up! Up!

25:02.266 --> 25:04.767
- Ohh.
- Aah!

25:04.769 --> 25:08.707
- Oh, shoot. You got it?
- Yeah.

25:17.013 --> 25:18.980
Hands down!

25:18.982 --> 25:20.818
Watch this.

25:23.220 --> 25:26.825
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

25:28.826 --> 25:32.297
Boys and gals,
y'all got some wind.

25:36.032 --> 25:37.635
Whoo-hoo!

26:22.313 --> 26:23.949
Trim's looking good.

26:24.781 --> 26:26.248
Lift the main.

26:26.250 --> 26:28.083
It's gonna catch right there
in an hour.

26:28.085 --> 26:29.884
- Aye-aye.
- Hey.

26:29.886 --> 26:31.353
Mike wants to know,
chicken or grouper?

26:31.355 --> 26:32.755
- Chicken.
- Grouper.

26:34.825 --> 26:36.792
Chicken's cool, I guess.

26:36.794 --> 26:37.829
Rockin' bikini.

26:38.762 --> 26:40.161
What's happened
to the rest of it?

26:40.163 --> 26:43.032
Where are your surf shorts?

26:43.034 --> 26:45.066
There's no surfing
on a sailboat, Dad.

26:45.068 --> 26:46.770
Copy that.

27:11.929 --> 27:13.828
Hey, what do you want,
chicken or grouper?

27:13.830 --> 27:15.698
Grouper.
Where's your sister?

27:15.700 --> 27:18.400
Um, Picasso's deep into
her latest masterpiece.

27:18.402 --> 27:20.134
I have no control over her.

27:20.136 --> 27:22.371
Help Mike with the sides,
watch and learn.

27:22.373 --> 27:25.744
You'll be doing it for real
paying customers come season.

27:27.877 --> 27:29.210
Is it true?

27:29.212 --> 27:30.714
What's that?

27:31.315 --> 27:34.016
What Jay said
about boats just turning up

27:34.018 --> 27:37.853
with no crew on board,
vanishing into the ether?

27:37.855 --> 27:40.722
Jay had one too many
free tequilas.

27:40.724 --> 27:43.991
Plus he's sore about losing
his best captain.

27:43.993 --> 27:47.028
No one just vanishes.

27:47.030 --> 27:49.398
Stuff happens on the open seas,
and not all of it's good.

27:49.400 --> 27:50.301
You know that.

27:51.367 --> 27:52.803
Yeah.

27:53.903 --> 27:56.007
Kind of like on land, huh?

28:03.047 --> 28:04.249
Yeah.

28:04.949 --> 28:06.782
Go help Mike.

28:06.784 --> 28:09.721
And put on some shorts before
your dad has a heart attack.

28:33.076 --> 28:35.344
Mary Greer.

28:35.346 --> 28:38.013
You wanna tell me why
this door's locked?

28:39.383 --> 28:40.951
Mary!

30:06.436 --> 30:07.971
What?

30:11.174 --> 30:12.943
We're drifting.

30:33.297 --> 30:34.833
Tommy?

30:38.269 --> 30:39.837
Tommy!

30:46.609 --> 30:50.912
♪ Let the waves crash over you ♪

30:50.914 --> 30:52.914
- ♪ Let the waves ♪
- Tommy.

30:52.916 --> 30:55.083
♪ Crash over you ♪

30:55.085 --> 30:59.421
♪ Let them send you out to sea ♪

30:59.423 --> 31:02.556
♪ Safely out to sea ♪

31:02.558 --> 31:04.258
♪ Till you... ♪

31:04.260 --> 31:09.334
Tommy, why'd you
raise the anchor?

31:11.101 --> 31:13.371
She wants us to keep going.

31:24.147 --> 31:26.483
Oh, my God! Tommy.

31:30.386 --> 31:32.487
Tommy.

31:32.489 --> 31:35.293
Okay.
Tommy, come downstairs.

31:36.160 --> 31:38.660
Tommy, come on!
That's an order!

31:48.204 --> 31:51.308
Tommy!
Stop it! Stop it!

31:54.644 --> 31:56.978
Tommy never said a word
after that.

31:56.980 --> 32:00.585
He just shut down completely.

32:04.153 --> 32:07.288
We had to drop him off in Abaco.

32:07.290 --> 32:09.027
So you abandoned him?

32:09.759 --> 32:11.996
You left Tommy behind?

32:13.096 --> 32:16.200
He wasn't Tommy anymore.

32:25.375 --> 32:27.676
She's gonna hate you
if don't tell her everything.

32:27.678 --> 32:29.344
Why don't you
just talk to her...

32:29.346 --> 32:30.644
- About what?
- ...about what happened?

32:30.646 --> 32:31.714
What, Sarah?

32:33.049 --> 32:36.320
That someone she's crushing on
went totally bat-shit?

32:37.320 --> 32:40.124
All she needs to know
is it wasn't working out.

32:40.758 --> 32:44.226
His uncle fishes
these open channels.

32:44.228 --> 32:46.327
He'll pick him up this week.

32:46.329 --> 32:49.363
So that's it?
We just leave him here... alone?

32:49.365 --> 32:52.334
He came at me with a knife,
Sarah.

32:52.336 --> 32:55.336
I can't have him on the boat
around the girls.

32:55.338 --> 32:57.040
Especially Lindsey.

32:59.076 --> 33:02.777
Hey, I've known that kid
for four years.

33:02.779 --> 33:06.414
I plucked him out
of the juvie program

33:06.416 --> 33:08.382
when his own family
wouldn't even stop

33:08.384 --> 33:10.052
to show him a fishing boat.

33:10.054 --> 33:13.688
No one cares about that kid more
than me, but he's got...

33:13.690 --> 33:18.997
he's got problems
that we can't help him with.

33:21.565 --> 33:23.768
We're all works in progress.

33:24.768 --> 33:26.069
Okay.

33:27.070 --> 33:30.774
Hey, after everything
we've been through...

33:33.242 --> 33:35.376
...I will not allow this
to fail.

33:35.378 --> 33:37.214
Okay.

33:56.799 --> 33:58.667
Honey, I know how you feel
about Tommy, baby.

33:58.669 --> 34:00.201
- No!
- I'm so sorry.

34:00.203 --> 34:01.569
I cannot believe you both

34:01.571 --> 34:02.837
are going to pretend
like nothing happened.

34:02.839 --> 34:04.706
No, that's not true.
We're all just...

34:04.708 --> 34:07.308
We're in the same boat? Really?
Do you want to go with that?

34:07.310 --> 34:09.811
Tommy is the only person
that I had here.

34:09.813 --> 34:11.277
I have nobody to talk to.

34:11.280 --> 34:12.780
You can talk to me, baby.
Come on.

34:12.782 --> 34:14.416
How can I talk to you?

34:14.418 --> 34:18.422
How can I trust you if you
fucking cheated on Dad?!

34:30.601 --> 34:31.900
All good?

34:31.902 --> 34:33.900
Oh...

34:33.902 --> 34:35.338
Come on.

34:37.474 --> 34:40.344
I should have just told him
when you first found out. I...

34:42.246 --> 34:44.646
It was wrong of me
to ask your silence

34:44.648 --> 34:47.181
and drag you into
this whole dumb mess.

34:47.184 --> 34:48.483
- I'm so sorry.
- Sarah, Sarah.

34:48.485 --> 34:50.583
- No, I'm so sorry.
- No one dragged me.

34:50.585 --> 34:52.387
All right?
I did what I did

34:52.389 --> 34:54.324
because I care about
both of you.

34:55.826 --> 35:00.162
Hey, it was a one-time thing
with that asshole, Sarah.

35:00.164 --> 35:04.166
David knows that.
And we make mistakes.

35:04.168 --> 35:06.503
God knows I've had
my fair share.

35:06.836 --> 35:08.369
Hmm?

35:08.371 --> 35:10.738
This boat belongs
to the two of you.

35:10.740 --> 35:12.740
It connects you.

35:12.742 --> 35:15.709
It's gonna take us all to
a better place. I know that.

35:15.711 --> 35:17.414
I really believe that.

35:18.648 --> 35:20.484
- All right?
- Thank you.

35:22.518 --> 35:24.788
It'll be fine.

35:28.391 --> 35:29.891
Shoving off in 30.

35:29.893 --> 35:31.295
Aye, Cap.

35:51.981 --> 35:55.483
What about Mike Alvarez?
You two were close.

35:55.485 --> 35:57.418
There was nothing there?

35:57.420 --> 36:02.456
No. No, Mike... Mike was like
a younger brother to David.

36:02.458 --> 36:04.194
We were family.

36:08.699 --> 36:11.335
We were a work in progress.

36:12.702 --> 36:14.704
David liked to say that.

36:17.708 --> 36:19.577
It was the only time
I ever strayed.

36:24.313 --> 36:25.449
Okay.

36:27.251 --> 36:29.617
You said your daughter Mary
was the first one in your family

36:29.619 --> 36:30.851
to be affected.

36:30.853 --> 36:33.290
Why do you think that was?

36:33.856 --> 36:35.326
I don't know.

36:36.559 --> 36:38.559
Maybe 'cause she's the youngest.

36:38.561 --> 36:45.733
And children believe
the things that we don't.

36:45.735 --> 36:49.472
She fed on that.
She... She used that. She...

36:50.606 --> 36:54.244
And that's why in the end,
I had to destroy her.

36:55.612 --> 36:58.615
I had to destroy her
'cause she was...

37:04.521 --> 37:06.490
We're gonna take a little break.

37:07.724 --> 37:09.356
I'll let you gather
your thoughts.

37:09.358 --> 37:11.392
I told you
you wouldn't believe me.

37:11.394 --> 37:14.528
I'm not here to believe you
and I'm not here to judge you

37:14.530 --> 37:17.298
on what you did or didn't do
with your marriage.

37:17.300 --> 37:21.603
But, Sarah, between you and me,
it's not looking good.

37:21.605 --> 37:23.037
Well, I know
it's not looking good!

37:23.039 --> 37:25.509
It's just... It's what happened!

37:28.010 --> 37:31.679
You expect me to sit here
and nod my head

37:31.681 --> 37:36.617
and believe that some spirit
or some entity came on board

37:36.619 --> 37:39.354
and overtook everyone
on the ship?

37:39.356 --> 37:41.889
Put yourself in my position.

37:41.891 --> 37:44.092
If you want to see
your girls again,

37:44.094 --> 37:47.798
you need to tell me something
that makes sense.

37:50.099 --> 37:51.833
Are you gonna let me finish?

37:51.835 --> 37:53.501
I will.

37:53.503 --> 37:55.670
But then you need to tell me
something I can use.

37:55.672 --> 37:58.039
Because <i>they</i> can charge you
with abandonment and sabotage,

37:58.041 --> 37:59.577
but <i>I</i> can charge you
with murder.

39:17.653 --> 39:18.822
Mary?

39:26.630 --> 39:28.365
Mary?

39:47.951 --> 39:49.786
Mary.

39:50.820 --> 39:53.824
Mary! Mary, come on!

39:54.623 --> 39:55.990
Oh, shit!

39:55.992 --> 39:59.661
Oh, shit!
Mary!

39:59.663 --> 40:02.632
David! David!

40:12.608 --> 40:14.411
Come on.

40:19.014 --> 40:20.617
What! Who's there?!

40:28.692 --> 40:32.726
She's been crashed out
for the last hour,

40:32.728 --> 40:34.864
dreaming of dolphins.

40:35.931 --> 40:38.266
No, but someone was holding
the door closed on me

40:38.268 --> 40:39.833
from the other side.

40:39.835 --> 40:43.104
It's an old ship.
Summer humidity.

40:43.106 --> 40:45.206
There's bound to be
some expansion in the wood.

40:45.208 --> 40:46.874
Someone closed the door on me,
David.

40:46.876 --> 40:48.709
And there were footprints,
wet footprints.

40:48.711 --> 40:51.713
It could have been Lindsey
just messing with you, you know?

40:51.715 --> 40:54.684
After what happened with Tommy.

40:55.619 --> 40:57.952
She probably blames both of us.

40:57.954 --> 41:02.757
Look, Mike... Mike told me
what went down.

41:02.759 --> 41:04.525
I'll talk to her, okay?

41:04.527 --> 41:06.594
No, no, don't do that.

41:06.596 --> 41:08.963
We'll work it out.
Let her be.

41:08.965 --> 41:10.731
But maybe you and Mike
could just check on

41:10.733 --> 41:12.670
the rest of the ship for me.

41:30.719 --> 41:32.954
Anything?

41:32.956 --> 41:34.724
Negative.

41:38.894 --> 41:40.728
- Is that sunburn?
- Ow!

41:40.730 --> 41:42.296
Stop it, cretin.

41:42.298 --> 41:45.599
- What's a cretin?
- Look it up.

41:45.601 --> 41:47.570
Wait, we don't have Wi-Fi.

41:48.170 --> 41:49.105
Now?

41:50.039 --> 41:51.541
One bar.

41:53.076 --> 41:54.677
Hallelujah.

41:56.947 --> 41:58.949
Ow! Damn it, Mary.

42:13.096 --> 42:16.166
Miracle of miracles,
we're almost at two bars.

42:22.038 --> 42:23.541
David?

42:30.112 --> 42:31.581
What's up?

42:37.387 --> 42:40.057
I just checked in with Abaco.

42:43.326 --> 42:46.293
Tommy hanged himself
last night in the hospital.

42:46.295 --> 42:48.264
Oh, my God.

42:50.333 --> 42:52.168
Oh, my God.

43:05.748 --> 43:07.283
Has anybody heard from Tommy?

43:09.018 --> 43:11.154
Do we know if he made it
back to Florida?

43:12.188 --> 43:14.322
I checked in with Abaco.

43:14.324 --> 43:17.191
But the channel's
been a bit cranky.

43:17.193 --> 43:19.296
I'm sure he's back by now.

43:24.166 --> 43:26.668
Mary, stop it with your tooth.

43:26.670 --> 43:28.135
But I want it out.

43:28.137 --> 43:29.369
It'll come out, baby.

43:29.371 --> 43:31.375
You just gotta give it time,
okay?

43:32.842 --> 43:35.175
We forgot some dinner
for the lady!

43:35.177 --> 43:36.711
Lady?

43:36.713 --> 43:39.383
Yeah, the squirt has
an imaginary friend now.

43:41.684 --> 43:44.385
I hear her talking to her
up in the upper bunk all night.

43:44.387 --> 43:46.690
Don't play with scary Mary.

43:47.423 --> 43:49.090
- Mary!
- Oh, shit!

43:49.092 --> 43:50.260
Are you okay?

43:51.126 --> 43:52.693
What the hell was that?!

43:52.695 --> 43:55.162
Say something.
What did you do?!

43:55.164 --> 43:56.396
Mary!

43:56.398 --> 43:58.067
Are you okay, sweetie?

44:01.271 --> 44:04.942
- Why would she do that?
- I don't know, sweetie.

44:07.309 --> 44:09.010
What's gotten into you?!

44:09.012 --> 44:11.179
Now, you think about
what you did.

44:11.181 --> 44:15.016
And you're going to
apologize to your sister!

44:15.018 --> 44:16.720
You hear me?

44:21.858 --> 44:23.427
You see this?

45:54.951 --> 45:56.320
David?

47:02.385 --> 47:03.950
<i>Sarah.</i>

47:03.952 --> 47:06.954
Help! Help me!
Help! Help me!

47:06.956 --> 47:08.222
Help!

47:08.224 --> 47:10.394
Sarah.
You okay?

47:12.394 --> 47:15.298
Yeah. I guess.

47:16.398 --> 47:18.032
He's been acting weird
ever since you gave

47:18.034 --> 47:19.300
him more time on the helm.

47:19.302 --> 47:20.934
Please, Sarah,
keep your voice down.

47:20.936 --> 47:22.970
No, don't tell me to keep
my voice down, David!

47:22.972 --> 47:25.309
Something is... Something is...

47:26.675 --> 47:30.378
Something's wrong here, okay?!

47:30.380 --> 47:32.213
And it wasn't just Mike.

47:32.215 --> 47:34.949
I-I heard this...

47:34.951 --> 47:37.550
No. I-I-I-I thought...
I thought I saw...

47:37.552 --> 47:39.387
- Sarah, Sarah, we both...
- No.

47:39.389 --> 47:41.688
We just both need
some sound sleep.

47:41.690 --> 47:43.391
- Sleep?! David!
- We'll think more clearly

47:43.393 --> 47:45.025
- in the a.m.
- David, who can sleep

47:45.027 --> 47:46.126
after the past two days?

47:46.128 --> 47:47.494
Oh, my God!

47:47.496 --> 47:50.333
After everything
that's happened? David!

47:51.501 --> 47:52.636
Maybe...

47:55.371 --> 47:57.405
Maybe we should just turn back.

47:57.407 --> 48:00.010
Oh, great.

48:01.043 --> 48:06.246
Look, something's... something's
very, very wrong here, David.

48:06.248 --> 48:08.382
And I'm hearing things
and I'm seeing things

48:08.384 --> 48:10.251
that I can't even explain.

48:10.253 --> 48:12.021
And the worst of it is that I...

48:13.255 --> 48:15.255
...I feel it.

48:15.257 --> 48:17.358
I feel it,
and I know you do, too.

48:17.360 --> 48:21.695
What I know is we're too far to
turn back even if we wanted to!

48:21.697 --> 48:23.933
Sarah! Sarah!

48:25.168 --> 48:28.501
Sarah, I-I know
you're super stressed.

48:28.503 --> 48:30.237
We both are.

48:30.239 --> 48:32.106
We've just had a run
of bad luck.

48:32.108 --> 48:34.474
No, no, David,
it's not bad luck.

48:34.476 --> 48:36.309
It's like...
It's like we're cursed.

48:36.311 --> 48:37.345
- Cursed?
- Yes!

48:37.347 --> 48:39.112
It's like this ship is cursed!

48:39.114 --> 48:40.380
Or is it me?

48:40.382 --> 48:41.648
I keep thinking maybe it's me.

48:41.650 --> 48:43.284
Maybe I... Maybe...

48:43.286 --> 48:45.987
Everything is riding on
the success of this ship!

48:45.989 --> 48:48.088
Oh, God.

48:48.090 --> 48:51.525
Now, we make it to Hamilton!
We will!

48:51.527 --> 48:53.661
And I don't want to hear
any more bullshit

48:53.663 --> 48:55.162
about fucking curses!

48:55.164 --> 48:58.435
- David!
- That's it! That's it!

49:02.405 --> 49:04.141
Fuck!

49:15.251 --> 49:18.455
Lindsey, hey,
you feeling better, honey?

49:26.561 --> 49:28.030
Mary?

49:34.369 --> 49:37.070
Ready to come out
and be a good girl?

49:46.416 --> 49:48.782
Aah! No! No!

49:48.784 --> 49:50.784
Get off! Get off!

49:50.786 --> 49:54.454
Sarah, shh!

49:54.456 --> 49:56.624
- Sarah! Sarah.
- Oh, God!

49:56.626 --> 49:58.295
Sarah.

49:59.394 --> 50:00.528
Mommy.

50:00.530 --> 50:02.229
Oh, baby!

50:02.231 --> 50:04.664
Baby! You're here.
Oh, sweetheart.

50:04.666 --> 50:08.068
You're here.
Oh, my God, you're here.

50:08.070 --> 50:10.606
It's okay.
She helped me pull it out.

50:19.114 --> 50:21.816
Sweetheart, what did you do?

50:21.818 --> 50:24.187
What... What happened to you?

50:25.788 --> 50:29.025
We'll be in Bermuda
before you know it.

50:30.559 --> 50:31.559
Hmm?

50:31.561 --> 50:33.764
Everything's gonna be okay.

50:44.840 --> 50:46.777
What's going on?

50:47.677 --> 50:49.709
I don't know.

50:49.711 --> 50:52.416
But it's gonna be okay,
I promise.

50:54.282 --> 50:55.684
I promise.

51:05.460 --> 51:08.561
- How is she?
- Yeah, bleeding's stopped.

51:08.563 --> 51:10.232
Lindsey's putting her
back to bed.

51:13.768 --> 51:16.539
Are you having them, too?
The dreams.

51:17.806 --> 51:19.275
Are you?

51:20.775 --> 51:24.345
Mike and I are gonna take shifts
helming through the night.

51:24.347 --> 51:28.151
We'll make Hamilton by tomorrow
morning if we beat the weather.

51:31.554 --> 51:34.356
We're not anchoring the ship
anymore.

54:02.771 --> 54:04.673
Captain Eagon...

54:05.775 --> 54:11.447
...departs Charleston
heading 70 degrees southeast.

54:43.846 --> 54:49.786
Captain Parish departs
heading 50 degrees southeast.

54:56.826 --> 55:01.697
Captain Sanfree departs Savannah
heading due east.

55:27.722 --> 55:34.963
All three voyages and ours
end at the same destination.

56:16.172 --> 56:18.838
Execute a new course setting.

56:18.840 --> 56:24.545
42 north, 78.2 west,
heading, 19 degrees.

56:24.547 --> 56:27.914
You sure about that?
We're making good time.

56:27.916 --> 56:29.485
Just do it, Mike.

56:33.188 --> 56:35.090
Aye-aye, Cap.

56:51.840 --> 56:57.547
Three... Three instances
of crews gone missing.

56:58.246 --> 57:01.048
And you didn't think
to share this, why?

57:01.050 --> 57:04.751
This... This happened
at least three times.

57:04.753 --> 57:06.787
Ever since her first voyage.

57:06.789 --> 57:11.224
Every time this ship went out
onto open water,

57:11.226 --> 57:13.559
people disappeared, David.

57:13.561 --> 57:16.597
Nobody even knows who
this ship really belongs to.

57:16.599 --> 57:18.965
It belongs to us.

57:18.967 --> 57:22.536
Horrible things happened
on board this ship, David.

57:22.538 --> 57:25.104
Jay was right.
You're a fisherman.

57:25.106 --> 57:27.907
You know not to
go near that shit!

57:27.909 --> 57:30.543
You think that just by slapping
some fresh paint

57:30.545 --> 57:32.179
and sails on her,
you can erase the past?!

57:32.181 --> 57:34.947
It's not about the past,
it's about the future.

57:34.949 --> 57:38.554
There is no future
on this thing!

57:39.521 --> 57:44.157
Sanfree, the last owner,
he had a son.

57:44.159 --> 57:46.760
And... And I think
she took him, David.

57:46.762 --> 57:49.862
It's like that legend of the
woman who lost her children.

57:49.864 --> 57:52.065
- It's...
- Enough!

57:52.067 --> 57:53.733
Enough.

57:53.735 --> 57:56.135
I did what I did to get us
away from that marina!

57:56.137 --> 58:00.574
To get us away from
the constant bullshit!

58:00.576 --> 58:03.075
This is about the future!

58:03.077 --> 58:05.646
I did what I did to get us
away from him!

58:05.648 --> 58:06.914
No, he's gone, David.

58:06.916 --> 58:09.486
He left months ago.
He's not there!

58:18.226 --> 58:22.097
Turned us against each other,
wore us down.

58:23.132 --> 58:25.298
It happened three times.
You know that.

58:25.300 --> 58:26.867
The...

58:26.869 --> 58:29.970
At least three times
that the captains,

58:29.972 --> 58:35.608
the crews, the families,
they all disappeared.

58:35.610 --> 58:38.181
She sent them all
to the same place.

58:39.815 --> 58:42.851
Maybe it's where she's the
strongest where she was drowned.

58:44.719 --> 58:48.688
Sarah, just because people
met with similar circumstances,

58:48.690 --> 58:52.659
it doesn't mean that something
bad was coming for them.

58:52.661 --> 58:53.860
You said it yourself.

58:53.862 --> 58:55.795
Things can happen
on the open water.

58:55.797 --> 58:58.365
And if what you're
telling me is true

58:58.367 --> 59:02.101
and something was pulling you
towards a certain direction,

59:02.103 --> 59:04.271
why not turn around
and go the other way?

59:04.273 --> 59:06.139
No, it was too late
to turn back.

59:06.141 --> 59:08.909
We'd gone too far.

59:08.911 --> 59:11.313
Then get off the goddamn boat.

59:12.280 --> 59:14.780
Well, I guess
you're not a sailor.

59:14.782 --> 59:19.021
'Cause the thing about boats
is there's nowhere to run.

59:20.789 --> 59:22.188
There out in the middle
of the ocean

59:22.190 --> 59:24.191
on 80 foot of wood and steel

59:24.193 --> 59:26.025
and you look true horror
in the face,

59:26.027 --> 59:28.597
and she stares right back
at you.

59:29.632 --> 59:32.865
She was never gonna let us go.

59:32.867 --> 59:35.771
You really believe this?

59:50.652 --> 59:53.288
It's been affecting you
this whole time.

59:54.822 --> 59:57.726
Ever since you
first came upon her.

01:00:00.295 --> 01:00:02.331
Been affecting us all.

01:00:06.934 --> 01:00:08.969
The coordinates
of the past journeys

01:00:08.971 --> 01:00:12.375
all correspond with ours.

01:00:13.809 --> 01:00:15.745
Almost perfectly.

01:00:17.211 --> 01:00:22.050
In the end, it's always
the same heading.

01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:26.787
She's taking us the same place
she took the others.

01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:30.791
There's something wrong
with Mary.

01:00:40.101 --> 01:00:41.967
- Mary! Mary!
- Mary! Mary!

01:00:41.969 --> 01:00:43.903
- Mary, look at me.
- She won't answer me.

01:00:43.905 --> 01:00:46.238
- Mary, look at me.
- My God, David, she's freezing.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:49.244
Mike! Call in a mayday!

01:00:52.481 --> 01:00:53.950
- Mike!
- Baby. Baby.

01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:56.918
Mike!

01:01:10.398 --> 01:01:11.933
Sarah!

01:01:14.335 --> 01:01:16.104
Aah!

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.443
What the fuck?

01:01:22.077 --> 01:01:23.809
Are you okay?

01:01:23.811 --> 01:01:27.016
- Sweetie, are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:47.235 --> 01:01:50.237
He tore up the main sail,

01:01:50.239 --> 01:01:52.238
along with the radio
and the Wi-Fi.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:55.911
The cellphones are missing
except for what's in the genny.

01:01:57.079 --> 01:01:58.815
We have no more gas.

01:02:01.315 --> 01:02:05.851
I can get a number three
at full.

01:02:05.853 --> 01:02:10.025
But without the others,
we have to wait for the wind.

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:15.398
No GPS or sonar.
How will we even find Hamilton?

01:02:16.164 --> 01:02:18.063
And Mary's still sick.

01:02:18.065 --> 01:02:19.965
The hell with Hamilton.

01:02:19.967 --> 01:02:24.905
I'm plotting a course
to the nearest shipping lane.

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:27.844
Fire up a flare, get picked up.

01:02:28.543 --> 01:02:31.114
We're getting off
this fucking hulk.

01:02:36.818 --> 01:02:38.054
Mike?

01:02:40.088 --> 01:02:42.354
What did you do with
the satellite phone?

01:02:42.356 --> 01:02:45.961
It's gone.
I threw it over the side.

01:02:47.496 --> 01:02:49.432
You won't need it.

01:02:50.364 --> 01:02:53.099
I know you don't want
to go back.

01:02:53.101 --> 01:02:55.938
I can hear it in your voice,
Dave.

01:02:56.972 --> 01:03:01.310
You and everything you love,
it all belongs to her now.

01:03:02.878 --> 01:03:07.479
You thought you could
bring your family to the sea

01:03:07.481 --> 01:03:09.885
for a second chance.

01:03:11.253 --> 01:03:14.554
This only ends in death,
for Sarah, the girls,

01:03:14.556 --> 01:03:17.793
you, for me, for all of us!

01:03:20.195 --> 01:03:22.097
Listen to me, Mike.

01:03:25.132 --> 01:03:28.101
I'm gonna channel into
the shipping lanes

01:03:28.103 --> 01:03:31.403
and get you and Mary help.

01:03:31.405 --> 01:03:35.378
Help? Help?
There's no help.

01:03:36.277 --> 01:03:40.482
You hear her, Dave.
She's calling the ship home.

01:03:44.219 --> 01:03:46.286
There's some water
in the thermos.

01:03:46.288 --> 01:03:47.519
Just stay cool.

01:03:47.521 --> 01:03:50.490
Stay cool?!
Keep cool?!

01:03:50.492 --> 01:03:54.964
You're too old and scared!
You must obey her.

01:03:55.496 --> 01:03:58.264
I'll help you gut them, rip
their skin from their bodies!

01:03:58.266 --> 01:03:59.999
Now, open the fucking door,
David!

01:04:00.001 --> 01:04:01.568
You need me.

01:04:01.570 --> 01:04:03.603
You don't have the courage
to do what needs to be done!

01:04:03.605 --> 01:04:05.271
You need me!

01:04:05.273 --> 01:04:07.673
Drown them! Drown them!
Drown them! Drown them!

01:04:07.675 --> 01:04:10.246
Open the fucking door!

01:05:07.335 --> 01:05:08.471
Mike.

01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:11.507
We have work to do.

01:05:29.623 --> 01:05:31.559
Lindsey.

01:05:36.597 --> 01:05:38.300
Come with me.

01:05:56.184 --> 01:05:57.386
Tommy?

01:06:28.416 --> 01:06:30.052
Tommy?

01:06:32.653 --> 01:06:34.119
What are you doing here?

01:06:34.121 --> 01:06:38.126
I came back for you.

01:06:51.706 --> 01:06:54.443
Lindsey? Lindsey!

01:06:57.211 --> 01:06:58.414
Lindsey!

01:07:01.416 --> 01:07:02.418
David!

01:07:05.119 --> 01:07:06.121
Lindsey!

01:07:08.523 --> 01:07:09.692
No!

01:07:17.498 --> 01:07:19.365
Lindsey!
Oh, my God!

01:07:19.367 --> 01:07:22.469
Oh, my God!
What are you doing? Honey.

01:07:22.471 --> 01:07:24.137
- Here.
- Honey.

01:07:24.139 --> 01:07:25.637
- Let's get her downstairs.
- Is she okay?

01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:31.177
- Here. Here.
- Come here. Come here.

01:07:31.179 --> 01:07:33.579
Come here, baby. Are you okay?
Come here.

01:07:33.581 --> 01:07:36.182
You can do this. Come on.
Can you turn around?

01:07:36.184 --> 01:07:37.450
- You got her?
- Honey. Yeah, I got her.

01:07:37.452 --> 01:07:39.355
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Here, come on.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.333
You think I'm crazy.

01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:54.503
I didn't say that.

01:07:55.336 --> 01:07:57.840
Didn't have to.
I can see it in your face.

01:08:01.275 --> 01:08:03.846
You have no idea
what you're up against.

01:08:07.315 --> 01:08:08.583
Tell me.

01:08:09.684 --> 01:08:11.885
Tell me what happened
to Mike Alvarez.

01:08:11.887 --> 01:08:14.621
Tell me what happened
to your husband.

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:17.359
You tell me how this ends.

01:08:17.893 --> 01:08:19.261
Ends?

01:08:57.599 --> 01:09:01.337
It's okay now.
You'll see him soon, Sarah.

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:08.473
Look, Mike, where are my babies?
Where are they?!

01:09:08.475 --> 01:09:10.309
They're not your babies anymore.

01:09:10.310 --> 01:09:14.313
They're hers!
Your souls belong to her now.

01:09:24.693 --> 01:09:26.493
No! No!

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:31.496
No! Mike! No!

01:09:31.497 --> 01:09:36.337
Where are my babies?!
Where are they?!

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:39.742
No! No!

01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:44.813
Get off me! No, Mike!

01:10:57.786 --> 01:10:59.318
Ah!

01:11:11.765 --> 01:11:13.368
Dave!

01:11:15.703 --> 01:11:18.974
Come on!
Let's get the girls!

01:11:23.677 --> 01:11:26.012
I'm gonna turn us around!

01:11:26.014 --> 01:11:27.914
I'm not getting off this thing
without you!

01:11:27.916 --> 01:11:29.014
You're coming with us, though,
right?

01:11:29.016 --> 01:11:31.584
I'm coming.
I love you!

01:11:31.586 --> 01:11:32.921
I love you!

01:11:33.854 --> 01:11:37.857
Mary! Lindsey!

01:11:57.511 --> 01:11:59.047
Oh!

01:12:07.721 --> 01:12:08.724
My babies!

01:12:09.957 --> 01:12:12.625
My babies!
Are you okay?!

01:12:12.627 --> 01:12:15.460
Okay, right, you're okay? Here,
we gotta get this off you now.

01:12:15.462 --> 01:12:17.530
Okay. Here, here.

01:12:17.532 --> 01:12:20.601
- Where's Dad?
- Get out! Don't look back!

01:12:22.404 --> 01:12:24.870
- Let's go! Mary, come on!
- Stop!

01:12:24.872 --> 01:12:28.609
Okay, okay, okay.

01:12:29.610 --> 01:12:31.880
Okay, Lin, quick, get up here!

01:12:33.046 --> 01:12:35.680
You okay, Mary?
Come on, hon, come on.

01:12:35.682 --> 01:12:37.519
You can do it. Come on, baby!
Okay, come on.

01:12:39.654 --> 01:12:41.657
Okay, get the ladder
over the side!

01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:46.461
Go!
Come on, go, go, no!

01:12:48.095 --> 01:12:50.963
Hurry, guys! You got it?!

01:12:58.172 --> 01:13:01.107
Hurry! Come on!

01:13:01.109 --> 01:13:03.009
Come on, sweetie.
Come on.

01:13:03.011 --> 01:13:06.448
Come on, come on, sweetie!
David! David!

01:13:10.717 --> 01:13:12.688
David!

01:13:13.454 --> 01:13:15.153
David! David!

01:13:18.792 --> 01:13:21.028
You're okay, honey, you're okay.

01:14:35.069 --> 01:14:37.169
I was thrown from the boat.

01:14:37.171 --> 01:14:41.674
I tried to find the girls,
but I was too weak.

01:14:41.676 --> 01:14:42.811
I couldn't...

01:14:45.646 --> 01:14:47.582
I couldn't get to them.

01:14:52.587 --> 01:14:54.756
She almost had me.

01:14:55.957 --> 01:14:57.759
But I destroyed her.

01:14:59.726 --> 01:15:01.997
I destroyed her,
and now I'm free.

01:15:05.065 --> 01:15:07.269
She'll never get those girls.

01:15:08.970 --> 01:15:10.838
They're mine.

01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:14.141
That's all that matters.

01:15:20.213 --> 01:15:22.850
I want to see my daughters now.

01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:31.290
What now?

01:15:31.292 --> 01:15:33.224
We give her a few minutes
with her children.

01:15:33.226 --> 01:15:35.894
Let her see what's
important in life.

01:15:35.896 --> 01:15:37.763
If she sticks to
a fantasy story,

01:15:37.765 --> 01:15:41.800
then push for
a psych evaluation,

01:15:41.802 --> 01:15:43.939
institutional commitment.

01:15:46.073 --> 01:15:50.041
Sometimes when people are in
the red, they create stories

01:15:50.043 --> 01:15:52.745
and make themselves believe it

01:15:52.747 --> 01:15:56.151
because of some severe trauma
or guilt.

01:15:57.351 --> 01:15:59.652
Either way, Lieutenant,
you were right.

01:15:59.654 --> 01:16:02.925
She definitely believes
what she's saying.

01:16:51.139 --> 01:16:53.004
Ma'am, step back! Step back!

01:17:09.256 --> 01:17:12.727
Jesus. I'm calling it in.

01:17:40.011 --> 01:17:45.011
