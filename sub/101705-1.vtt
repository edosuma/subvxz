Nothing violent?

05:02.519 --> 05:04.042
Did the vic ID him,
or was it just the mom?

09:08.852 --> 09:11.333
- 6:00 A.M. meeting?
What program?

09:11.376 --> 09:13.378
- NA.

09:13.422 --> 09:16.512
Last spring, I hurt my back.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.123
I got hooked on oxy.
I'm clean now.

09:19.167 --> 09:21.299
- So why didn't you
just tell us that?

09:21.343 --> 09:23.258
- I wanna advance.

09:23.301 --> 09:26.261
Drivers get better benefits,
better pay.

09:26.304 --> 09:28.002
I didn't want you

09:28.045 --> 09:29.873
telling my boss
I was at a meeting.

09:29.917 --> 09:31.658
- There's no way your boss

09:31.701 --> 09:34.182
will ever hear that from us,

09:34.225 --> 09:36.706
but I'm gonna need
your sponsor's number.

09:41.711 --> 09:44.192
- That the kid who
was attacked in the park?

09:44.235 --> 09:45.323
It's all over the news.

09:45.367 --> 09:46.934
- Do you recognize him
from last night?

09:46.977 --> 09:48.413
Because he was here
charging drinks at closing.

09:48.457 --> 09:50.328
- That right?

09:50.372 --> 09:52.200
I don't remember him.

09:52.243 --> 09:53.897
- How 'bout this guy?

09:53.941 --> 09:56.465
- Him?
Yeah, I think so.

09:56.508 --> 09:58.598
But it was busy.
Everyone was outside.

09:58.641 --> 09:59.990
Nobody at the bar.

10:00.034 --> 10:02.906
When I'm slammed,
I only got eyes for the green.

10:02.950 --> 10:04.342
- All right, well,
we'll need to take a look

10:04.386 --> 10:05.648
at your security cam footage.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.868
- Sorry, no can do.
It's busted.

10:07.911 --> 10:10.435
- Mr. Donovan, we don't care
if you black out your windows,

10:10.479 --> 10:11.872
stay open past last call.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.438
- I run a reputable place.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.179
- Okay, so you won't mind
a couple of my tech guys

10:15.223 --> 10:17.268
come down and see
if they can find anything?

10:17.312 --> 10:19.009
- Not without a warrant.

10:19.053 --> 10:21.011
- Rollins.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.103
We might not need him.

10:26.147 --> 10:28.236
Just got
the traffic cam footage.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.631
- Well, it's definitely
not Jayvon.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.371
Hold on.

10:33.415 --> 10:34.459
That guy was at the park.

10:34.503 --> 10:36.113
- Are you sure?

10:36.157 --> 10:38.594
- Yeah, he was mouthing off,
filming us at the arrest.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.640
Son of a bitch.

10:44.513 --> 10:46.297
- This guy was in the park?

10:46.341 --> 10:47.690
Any chance you got an ID?

10:47.734 --> 10:49.170
- He was just filming,

10:49.213 --> 10:50.693
which, as we've been told
repeatedly, is not illegal.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.913
- He was brazen enough to go
back to his own crime scene,

10:52.956 --> 10:54.958
so maybe he posted it.
- Okay, text me those photos.

10:55.002 --> 10:57.613
See if TARU
can track down the video.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.050
Aquino's still unconscious?
- Mm-hmm.

11:00.094 --> 11:01.965
- See if the brother
can ID this guy.

11:02.009 --> 11:04.011
- Liv...

11:04.054 --> 11:05.403
I got Jayvon's sponsor
on the line.

11:05.447 --> 11:07.057
He's a corporate lawyer.

11:07.101 --> 11:10.147
He says he'll only talk to us
if Jayvon gives him permission.

11:10.191 --> 11:12.193
- Okay.

11:13.324 --> 11:15.109
- Corey, it's okay
to talk to them.

11:15.152 --> 11:16.414
<i>- That's all I need to hear.</i>

11:16.458 --> 11:17.807
- This is Captain Benson.

11:17.851 --> 11:20.201
Can you tell us
when you last saw Jayvon?

11:20.244 --> 11:21.593
<i>- This morning.</i>

11:21.637 --> 11:23.726
<i>We met at 5:30 for coffee
and a walk.</i>

11:23.770 --> 11:25.728
<i>At 6:00, we went to
our NA meeting</i>

11:25.772 --> 11:28.426
<i>in the garden at St. Clair's.
At 7:00, we said goodbye.</i>

11:28.470 --> 11:30.341
<i>He was his way to the park
to work out, Captain.</i>

11:30.385 --> 11:31.995
- That's what I been
telling her.

11:32.039 --> 11:34.258
<i>- Jayvon has been diligently
working his program.</i>

11:34.302 --> 11:35.651
<i>I don't see him doing anything</i>

11:35.695 --> 11:37.697
<i>that would jeopardize
his recovery or his job,</i>

11:37.740 --> 11:40.090
<i>and I could get a dozen others
to vouch for him as well.</i>

11:40.134 --> 11:41.439
- Thank you very much.

11:41.483 --> 11:42.876
<i>- Jayvon, do you need
a lawyer?</i>

11:42.919 --> 11:44.660
<i>I can send someone
from my firm.</i>

11:44.704 --> 11:47.271
- That's up to them.
Am I free to go?

11:47.315 --> 11:49.186
- Yes, we just have
to call the DA

11:49.230 --> 11:50.579
and get him
to drop the charges.

11:50.622 --> 11:53.103
- Yeah.
I would do that.

11:53.147 --> 11:54.801
<i>- As soon as possible,
Captain.</i>

11:54.844 --> 11:56.759
<i>Jayvon,
call if you need anything.</i>

11:56.803 --> 11:58.108
- Fin.

11:58.152 --> 12:00.676
- Start the paperwork?
On it.

12:02.243 --> 12:04.811
Jayvon, can we ask you
another question?

12:04.854 --> 12:06.116
- Do I have a choice?

12:06.160 --> 12:07.639
- There may be another suspect,

12:07.683 --> 12:09.816
and we were hoping
that you could help us.

12:13.036 --> 12:14.777
- You want my help now?

12:14.821 --> 12:18.302
- He was in the park
this morning at the scene.

12:18.346 --> 12:19.782
Did you notice him?

12:19.826 --> 12:23.786
- Before or after the cops
threw me in the squad car?

12:25.832 --> 12:27.834
Even if I did notice him,

12:27.877 --> 12:30.358
why would I help you?

12:30.401 --> 12:32.969
- I get it.
You have the right to be angry.

12:33.013 --> 12:35.842
- Don't tell me
I have a right to my anger.

12:37.104 --> 12:39.628
I already know that.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.721
- All those machines...

12:47.854 --> 12:49.507
All the tests...

12:51.901 --> 12:53.337
The doctors have no idea

12:53.381 --> 12:55.687
when or if Eric
is going to wake up.

12:55.731 --> 12:58.647
- I am so sorry.

13:00.562 --> 13:03.739
- He is in God's hands now.

13:04.696 --> 13:07.003
How could that man in the park
just leave him there?

13:07.047 --> 13:10.485
- We don't think it was him.

13:12.139 --> 13:14.271
Do you recognize this man?

13:14.315 --> 13:17.840
- No.

13:17.884 --> 13:20.756
I know Eric's friends
from high school, but...

13:22.889 --> 13:25.717
That was a long time ago.

13:28.111 --> 13:30.200
- He is Eric's type.

13:30.244 --> 13:31.462
Straight-looking, preppy.

13:31.506 --> 13:33.029
Calls him his "Chino Boys."

13:33.073 --> 13:34.596
- You ever meet him?

13:34.639 --> 13:36.119
- It's not like he ever
brought these guys home

13:36.163 --> 13:37.947
for Sunday chicken adobo.
- Hmm.

13:37.991 --> 13:40.384
Anyone in Eric's life
who might know?

13:40.428 --> 13:43.257
- My brother compartmentalized.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.520
Med school in one box,
family another.

13:45.563 --> 13:47.043
- Hookups in a third.

13:47.087 --> 13:49.654
- Kat?
- One sec.

13:49.698 --> 13:51.918
- TARU may have something.

13:54.268 --> 13:55.704
- "Hottie Cop Telling Me
to Move"?

13:55.747 --> 13:57.358
Seriously?

13:57.401 --> 13:59.490
<i>- I have a right to film.
- Guys, move back, thank you.</i>

13:59.534 --> 14:03.016
<i>- NYPD, man, protecting
and serving themselves.</i>

14:03.059 --> 14:06.497
<i>Defund the police.
Defund the police!</i>

14:06.541 --> 14:07.847
- We have an ID on this guy?

14:07.890 --> 14:10.240
- Just a handle.
ThirstTrap94.

14:10.284 --> 14:11.502
- "Thirst trap"?

14:11.546 --> 14:13.113
Wow, this dude's
feeling himself.

14:13.156 --> 14:14.766
- [chuckles]
Yeah.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.638
I checked his other posts,
and I found this.

14:16.681 --> 14:19.119
He tags two girls:
Danielle and Hana.

14:19.162 --> 14:20.424
Start there?

14:20.468 --> 14:22.426
- Find the one
that he didn't tag.

14:22.470 --> 14:24.646
She may have a more interesting
story to tell.

14:24.689 --> 14:25.603
- Always.

14:25.647 --> 14:28.563
- Captain.
- Chief.

14:28.606 --> 14:29.999
- I know it's late,

14:30.043 --> 14:32.915
but I need a word with you
and Sergeant Tutuola...

14:32.959 --> 14:35.831
Jayvon Brown has filed
a lawsuit against NYPD.

14:37.311 --> 14:39.443
You've both been named.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.753
- Jayvon Brown had
outstanding warrants.

14:44.796 --> 14:45.928
He wouldn't answer questions...

14:45.972 --> 14:47.147
- There was a crowd.

14:47.190 --> 14:48.539
You know how fast
they turn now--

14:48.583 --> 14:50.977
- Stop.
You both sound defensive.

14:51.020 --> 14:54.371
These days,
that's not a good look.

14:54.415 --> 14:56.330
- Chief, we were by the book.

14:56.373 --> 14:59.550
- That's the book
that got us here!

15:04.599 --> 15:06.296
After George Floyd,

15:06.340 --> 15:08.603
Breonna Taylor, this city,

15:08.646 --> 15:10.953
this country, are on boil.

15:10.997 --> 15:13.738
Business as usual
will not work.

15:17.090 --> 15:19.657
- We hear you.
- Good.

15:19.701 --> 15:21.485
1PP has launched
an investigation,

15:21.529 --> 15:24.793
and IAB wants to start
with you.

15:24.836 --> 15:26.838
- When?
- Tomorrow.

15:26.882 --> 15:29.058
Keep in mind,

15:29.102 --> 15:31.321
we're under a microscope.

15:31.365 --> 15:34.063
When you go in there,
short answers.

15:34.107 --> 15:35.673
Don't overexplain.

15:35.717 --> 15:38.894
- Okay.
- And bring a lawyer.

15:44.552 --> 15:46.728
- Sergeant, walk me out.

15:53.082 --> 15:55.519
- Captain did nothing wrong.

15:55.563 --> 15:58.348
- I know you two are close,
but I have to ask.

15:58.392 --> 15:59.915
Would things have
played out differently

15:59.959 --> 16:01.047
if Jayvon were white?

16:01.090 --> 16:03.919
- Yeah, I mean,
the woman, Colleen,

16:03.963 --> 16:05.921
she would've never called
the police in the first place,

16:05.965 --> 16:08.837
and if she did, the precinct
cop wouldn't have cuffed him.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.317
- I concur.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.536
And when SVU got there,

16:12.580 --> 16:14.625
do you think racial bias
played any part

16:14.669 --> 16:16.497
in how things were handled?

16:16.540 --> 16:18.151
- Not consciously.

16:18.194 --> 16:20.588
I've worked with Captain Benson
for over 20 years.

16:20.631 --> 16:23.460
Her only bias
is for the victim.

16:23.504 --> 16:26.420
- All right.
Thank you.

16:28.552 --> 16:32.513
Sergeant...

16:32.556 --> 16:34.645
I know I'm not someone
you relate to,

16:34.689 --> 16:37.257
but we have one thing
in common.

16:37.300 --> 16:38.998
We're both Black and blue.

16:39.041 --> 16:42.044
We've been on this job
a long time.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.872
Did you know my father
joined the force in the '70s?

16:43.915 --> 16:45.265
- No, I didn't know that.

16:45.308 --> 16:46.744
- Made Sergeant.

16:46.788 --> 16:48.703
Those days,
that was about as far

16:48.746 --> 16:50.922
as they'd let us go.

16:50.966 --> 16:52.968
Those days are over.
Things are changing.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.013
- [laughs]

16:54.056 --> 16:56.624
Know how many times
I've heard that?

16:56.667 --> 16:58.756
The one thing I do know

16:58.800 --> 17:01.324
is this country will always
break your heart.

17:01.368 --> 17:03.848
- Ah, this time's different.

17:03.892 --> 17:06.025
This is
a true inflection point.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.374
[siren wailing]

17:07.417 --> 17:08.679
- If you say so, Chief.

17:08.723 --> 17:12.074
- We are.
I know it.

17:12.118 --> 17:15.295
I also know the old guard
won't go down without a fight.

17:15.338 --> 17:16.774
There's gonna be a purge.

17:16.818 --> 17:20.256
- Hold up.
So what are you saying?

17:20.300 --> 17:21.779
- I appreciate your loyalty,

17:21.823 --> 17:23.651
but you need to watch out
for yourself.

17:23.694 --> 17:26.262
This is your second lawsuit
this year.

17:26.306 --> 17:28.482
You shot a black man
in his home.

17:28.525 --> 17:31.093
- Who was trying
to kill his son.

17:31.137 --> 17:33.530
- It was a good shooting,
but that doesn't matter.

17:33.574 --> 17:35.097
None of us are safe.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.056
Not me, not you,

17:37.099 --> 17:40.102
not Captain Benson.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.416
- What did Joe do now?

17:49.459 --> 17:51.113
- Joe?
You got a last name?

17:51.157 --> 17:54.116
- Joe Murphy.
- How do you know him?

17:54.160 --> 17:57.250
- We used to have a thing
for, like, a minute.

17:57.293 --> 18:00.166
[chuckles]
He needs to be canceled.

18:00.209 --> 18:02.124
- We noticed he untagged you.

18:02.168 --> 18:04.822
- Yeah, he couldn't take it
that I broke up with him.

18:04.866 --> 18:06.998
He can be a real charmer,

18:07.042 --> 18:08.261
but he's a different person

18:08.304 --> 18:09.784
once he hits
the tequila turnpike.

18:09.827 --> 18:11.177
- How so?

18:11.220 --> 18:14.267
- When he couldn't get it up,
he'd go off on me.

18:14.310 --> 18:17.139
He'd come back the next day
with flowers,

18:17.183 --> 18:20.795
but that got old fast.

18:20.838 --> 18:22.579
What was I thinking?

18:22.623 --> 18:24.973
Twenty-five, and he still
lives with his mother.

18:25.016 --> 18:27.976
- [sighs]

18:30.718 --> 18:32.285
<i>[knocking]</i>

18:33.373 --> 18:35.549
- Mrs. Murphy?
- Yeah?

18:35.592 --> 18:37.246
- We're here to see
your son, Joe.

18:37.290 --> 18:38.943
- I don't think he's home.

18:38.987 --> 18:42.121
- I'm right here, Ma.

18:43.078 --> 18:45.211
Hey, blondie cop.

18:45.254 --> 18:47.169
I hope you're not upset
about my video.

18:47.213 --> 18:49.519
- No, it was very helpful.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.869
- Look, I know I was all

18:51.913 --> 18:54.524
"BLM" in the park.
[laughs]

18:54.568 --> 18:56.874
But really, you cops
didn't do anything wrong.

18:56.918 --> 18:59.268
I heard that thug's
filing a lawsuit.

18:59.312 --> 19:01.314
Do you need me to back you up?

19:01.357 --> 19:03.533
- Actually, yes.

19:03.577 --> 19:05.753
Yeah, it would be great if you
could come down to the station

19:05.796 --> 19:06.884
and just give us a statement.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.364
- Sure.
Whatever you guys need.

19:08.408 --> 19:09.496
- Joe.

19:09.539 --> 19:11.367
- It's all right, Ma.
If I can help...

19:11.411 --> 19:13.369
- Joe, Joe.

19:13.413 --> 19:14.544
You need a mask.

19:14.588 --> 19:16.198
- [scoffs]

19:16.242 --> 19:17.634
- He came in willingly?

19:17.678 --> 19:20.594
- Yeah, he made a big show
of wanting to help.

19:20.637 --> 19:21.986
For what it's worth,

19:22.030 --> 19:24.337
Eric Aquino's brother did say
he's Eric's type.

19:24.380 --> 19:27.035
- The lab found DNA
on Aquino's underwear.

19:27.078 --> 19:28.863
You think Murphy's
cooperative enough

19:28.906 --> 19:30.169
to give us a sample?

19:30.212 --> 19:33.346
- We don't have to ask him.
He's wearing a mask.

19:33.389 --> 19:35.217
- Hmm.

19:35.261 --> 19:38.394
- Why don't I get him
a fresh one?

19:38.438 --> 19:39.830
- Keep me posted.

19:39.874 --> 19:42.572
I gotta head to IAB.

19:42.616 --> 19:44.748
Hey, by the way,

19:44.792 --> 19:46.707
Garland say anything about me?

19:46.750 --> 19:50.319
- Yeah.
Watch your back.

19:56.499 --> 19:58.719
- Hey, you mind swapping out
for a mask with a filter?

19:58.762 --> 20:00.068
NYPD protocol.

20:00.111 --> 20:02.288
- Sure.
Can't be too careful, right?

20:02.331 --> 20:04.464
- No.

20:08.294 --> 20:11.122
- So did you see Jayvon Brown
do anything suspicious?

20:11.166 --> 20:13.124
- No, when I got there,
he was cuffed.

20:13.168 --> 20:14.648
- Hmm, okay, and the vic?

20:14.691 --> 20:16.519
You ever seen him before?

20:16.563 --> 20:17.999
- No, sorry.

20:18.042 --> 20:19.783
- Really?

20:19.827 --> 20:22.569
So this isn't you?

20:22.612 --> 20:26.007
- Oh, wait.
That's the guy?

20:26.050 --> 20:28.401
Wow, I didn't put
two and two together.

20:28.444 --> 20:30.054
- So you don't remember
having drinks with him

20:30.098 --> 20:32.666
at Owney Madden's?
Leaving after last call?

20:32.709 --> 20:34.929
- Whoa, whoa.
No.

20:34.972 --> 20:38.411
It's not like that.
He followed me out of the bar.

20:38.454 --> 20:39.847
He was kinda hitting on me.

20:39.890 --> 20:41.892
I didn't want to be rude,
so I let him walk with me.

20:41.936 --> 20:43.285
- All the way to the park?

20:43.329 --> 20:45.505
- Dude, do I look gay?
[laughs]

20:45.548 --> 20:46.636
I'm engaged.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.072
I went right to
my fiancée's place.

20:48.116 --> 20:49.683
- This was when?

20:49.726 --> 20:51.162
- 4:30?
5:00?

20:51.206 --> 20:53.513
- So how did you end up
back in the park?

20:53.556 --> 20:54.992
- Well, Ashley lives
by the park.

20:55.036 --> 20:56.167
- Oh.

20:56.211 --> 20:57.168
- I heard all
the sirens outside

20:57.212 --> 20:58.169
and went down to check it out.

20:58.213 --> 20:59.562
- So I'll need to talk
to Ashley.

20:59.606 --> 21:02.086
- Sure, I'll call her.
- We'll do that.

21:15.839 --> 21:16.927
- Captain Benson?
- Yes.

21:16.971 --> 21:18.189
- Captain Curry.

21:18.233 --> 21:19.843
- Hi.
Nice to meet you.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.192
- Actually, we've met--

21:21.236 --> 21:24.283
briefly,
at Ed Tucker's funeral.

21:24.326 --> 21:26.459
- Oh, yes, of course.

21:26.502 --> 21:29.636
I'm sorry,
I wasn't myself that day.

21:29.679 --> 21:31.681
- Neither was I.

21:31.725 --> 21:33.553
Ed was my rabbi.

21:33.596 --> 21:35.990
His poor wife.

21:36.033 --> 21:38.035
- Yes.

21:38.079 --> 21:39.646
Are you recording this?

21:39.689 --> 21:41.778
- Once we start the interview.
We can wait for your lawyer.

21:41.822 --> 21:43.693
- I'm not bringing one.

21:43.737 --> 21:45.304
I know that that video
went viral,

21:45.347 --> 21:48.307
but our conduct was--
was by the book.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.047
- Then this shouldn't
take long.

21:50.091 --> 21:52.267
[beeps]

21:55.575 --> 21:56.967
- He's sleeping.

21:57.011 --> 21:58.360
Good.
Means he's guilty.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.362
How's his alibi?
- Bogus.

22:00.406 --> 22:03.060
- What about the DNA?
- Not back yet.

22:03.104 --> 22:05.149
- He doesn't need to know that.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.240
- Joe.
Joe!

22:10.764 --> 22:13.462
- Ashley back me up?
- And then some.

22:13.506 --> 22:15.290
She told us that you got
to her place

22:15.334 --> 22:17.161
around 10:00 P.M.

22:17.205 --> 22:19.555
- What can I say?
She's loyal.

22:19.599 --> 22:21.427
- And she's a liar.
How 'bout you?

22:21.470 --> 22:22.732
- What are you talking about?

22:22.776 --> 22:24.691
- Oh, we're taking your DNA
from your mask.

22:24.734 --> 22:26.606
Now is there any reason
it might be a match

22:26.649 --> 22:29.522
to the DNA
that we found on Aquino?

22:30.827 --> 22:32.307
- Uh...

22:32.351 --> 22:35.571
Okay, I might've left this out.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.357
The guy asked me
to come into the park,

22:38.400 --> 22:39.749
smoke a joint.

22:39.793 --> 22:42.099
I'm drunk, I say yes,

22:42.143 --> 22:44.928
then he gets persuasive.

22:44.972 --> 22:46.408
- Meaning?

22:46.452 --> 22:49.193
- He says, "Close your eyes.
Pretend I'm a girl.

22:49.237 --> 22:51.718
I'm gonna give you
the greatest blow--"

22:51.761 --> 22:54.938
Forgive me.
He offers to service me.

22:54.982 --> 22:56.287
- And then what happened?

22:56.331 --> 22:58.246
- He starts to unzip me.

22:58.289 --> 23:00.901
Like I say, I'm not gay,
so I freak out.

23:00.944 --> 23:02.381
I push him off of me and run.

23:02.424 --> 23:04.731
- How hard you push him?
- Not hard.

23:04.774 --> 23:07.690
I look back,
he's running after me.

23:07.734 --> 23:09.300
He was a lot more drunk
than I was.

23:09.344 --> 23:10.954
He must've taken a fall.

23:10.998 --> 23:13.435
- Did you see him take a fall?

23:13.479 --> 23:15.481
- Mr. Murphy's attorney's here.

23:16.786 --> 23:18.179
- Thanks, Sonny.

23:18.222 --> 23:19.659
Tell your sister, Teresa,
I say hi.

23:19.702 --> 23:22.052
- They'll need the room.
- Hold up, he's lawyering up?

23:22.096 --> 23:23.619
Why don't we just arraign
his ass?

23:23.663 --> 23:24.707
- Wait, I didn't ask
for a lawyer.

23:24.751 --> 23:27.623
- Zito, Joe.
Mr. Donovan hired me.

23:27.667 --> 23:30.234
He's looking out for you
and your mother.

23:30.278 --> 23:32.541
- The owner of the bar
and your mom.

23:32.585 --> 23:34.630
That's why he covered for you.

23:34.674 --> 23:37.938
- He did?
He's loyal too.

23:37.981 --> 23:39.983
Good people.

23:40.027 --> 23:42.116
I drink for free every night.

23:42.159 --> 23:44.248
- [sighs]

23:46.163 --> 23:49.515
- The victim, Eric Aquino,
couldn't describe his assailant

23:49.558 --> 23:51.255
because he was unconscious.

23:51.299 --> 23:52.866
- So other than
the park mother,

23:52.909 --> 23:54.650
Colleen Reynold's
false accusation,

23:54.694 --> 23:56.870
you had no reason
to suspect Jayvon Brown?

23:56.913 --> 23:59.612
- As I said, Mr. Brown
was already under arrest

23:59.655 --> 24:01.831
for outstanding warrants
when we got there.

24:01.875 --> 24:03.877
- So you're saying
you had no choice?

24:03.920 --> 24:04.921
- A crowd was gathering.

24:04.965 --> 24:06.357
He wasn't cooperating.

24:06.401 --> 24:07.489
I didn't wanna release him

24:07.533 --> 24:10.144
before ruling him out
as a suspect.

24:10.187 --> 24:12.494
- Okay.

24:12.538 --> 24:15.192
Captain Benson, had you ever
encountered Mr. Brown before?

24:15.236 --> 24:18.108
- No, not to my knowledge.

24:18.152 --> 24:20.371
- Do you recall a stop
and frisk of a black male

24:20.415 --> 24:23.200
on August 6, 2013

24:23.244 --> 24:24.637
outside the Wagner Houses?

24:24.680 --> 24:27.509
- Can you give me
a little bit more context?

24:27.553 --> 24:31.513
- Detective Nick Amaro
filed the 2-50.

24:31.557 --> 24:34.647
He was your partner then?
The Jolene Castille case?

24:34.690 --> 24:37.040
- The chef.
Right, right, right.

24:37.084 --> 24:38.477
- Ms. Castille, a white woman,

24:38.520 --> 24:40.479
shot Mehcad Carter,
an innocent Black teen,

24:40.522 --> 24:42.219
falsely claiming
he was a rapist.

24:42.263 --> 24:43.438
- That was a tragedy,

24:43.482 --> 24:46.093
and we tried to remedy
that situation, but...

24:46.136 --> 24:47.703
- Captain, one of the Black
males you and your partner

24:47.747 --> 24:51.402
stopped and frisked that day
was Jayvon Brown.

24:55.232 --> 24:58.758
- He must have
fit the profile.

24:58.801 --> 25:01.064
We were pursuing

25:01.108 --> 25:03.023
a black male serial rapist.

25:03.066 --> 25:05.591
- And what profile
did he fit yesterday?

25:07.593 --> 25:11.205
- Again, the arresting officers
had run his name,

25:11.248 --> 25:13.773
and they found
outstanding warrants.

25:13.816 --> 25:16.819
- Did you ask the officers
to run Colleen Reynolds' name?

25:16.863 --> 25:19.561
- No, I did not.

25:19.605 --> 25:21.824
- She has a history
of false accusations

25:21.868 --> 25:24.087
and her ex has a restraining
order against her.

25:24.131 --> 25:26.046
- I should have
run her name too.

25:26.089 --> 25:28.265
That--that was my mistake.

25:28.309 --> 25:30.877
- Have you given any thought as
to why you made that mistake?

25:32.313 --> 25:34.489
- If you're suggesting

25:34.533 --> 25:37.448
that I'm biased, I'm not.

25:37.492 --> 25:40.321
And I am well aware
of false accusations,

25:40.364 --> 25:43.498
especially with men of color.

25:47.154 --> 25:48.329
- I'm gonna stop you here

25:48.372 --> 25:49.504
before you tell me
you're an ally.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.375
- Excuse me?

25:51.419 --> 25:54.291
- Since George Floyd, I've
taken statement after statement

25:54.335 --> 25:56.206
from two kinds of cops:

25:56.250 --> 25:58.687
the baton swinging gladiators
who take one look at me

25:58.731 --> 26:00.515
and can barely hide
their disdain...

26:00.559 --> 26:03.039
- And I'm sorry that you
had to experience that.

26:03.083 --> 26:05.999
- And the well-intentioned,
guardian cops

26:06.042 --> 26:07.870
who never see
themselves as racist,

26:07.914 --> 26:10.090
but are in denial
about their complicity

26:10.133 --> 26:14.311
in the systemic racism
within the NYPD...

26:14.355 --> 26:16.531
Cops like you, Captain Benson.

26:19.142 --> 26:21.884
- I'm well aware

26:21.928 --> 26:24.800
there's racism in NYPD.

26:24.844 --> 26:27.368
- And what about your own bias?

26:28.587 --> 26:30.545
- I'm not racist.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.068
- I'm sure you're not,

26:32.112 --> 26:34.331
explicitly.

26:34.375 --> 26:37.073
But implicitly?

26:37.117 --> 26:40.381
If you grew up in this country,
it's in you and me.

26:40.424 --> 26:42.339
I struggle every day
with my own biases.

26:42.383 --> 26:44.167
For too many people,

26:44.211 --> 26:46.517
law enforcement has
lost all credibility,

26:46.561 --> 26:48.563
and until every one of us

26:48.607 --> 26:51.827
takes a serious self-inventory,

26:51.871 --> 26:55.048
we can't begin to get it back.

27:03.056 --> 27:05.145
- Ah.
After speaking to Joe,

27:05.188 --> 27:07.321
I found a way out
of this unfortunate situation.

27:07.364 --> 27:08.670
- Have you?

27:08.714 --> 27:09.889
- Yeah, as my client stated,

27:09.932 --> 27:11.978
he was lured to the park
by Mr. Aquino,

27:12.021 --> 27:13.980
who gave him drugs
and became sexually aggressive.

27:14.023 --> 27:16.156
- Really, so why is Mr. Aquino

27:16.199 --> 27:18.114
in the ICU, unconscious,

27:18.158 --> 27:19.812
a victim of rape?

27:19.855 --> 27:21.335
- That's how things
sometimes go wrong

27:21.378 --> 27:24.120
when drugs, alcohol, and
misplaced passion are involved.

27:24.164 --> 27:26.427
- Okay, you wanna sell that
to a jury?

27:26.470 --> 27:28.168
Go ahead.
Book him.

27:28.211 --> 27:30.779
Attempted murder, assault one,
and criminal sexual act.

27:30.823 --> 27:33.129
- Hold up, Counselor.

27:33.173 --> 27:35.175
Given the unfortunate
turn of events,

27:35.218 --> 27:38.700
Joe would be willing
to consider mis-d assault.

27:38.744 --> 27:41.007
- Mr. Aquino has
bruising, trauma,

27:41.050 --> 27:43.139
and your client's DNA
in his underwear.

27:43.183 --> 27:45.272
- Which can happen
with consensual sex.

27:45.315 --> 27:46.708
- Consensual?

27:46.752 --> 27:47.796
He tried to force himself
on me.

27:47.840 --> 27:48.884
- All right, Joe, if I may--

27:48.928 --> 27:49.972
- All right,
get him out of here.

27:50.016 --> 27:51.191
- Stand up, Joe.
You're under arrest.

27:51.234 --> 27:52.714
- All right, good luck
getting an indictment.

27:52.758 --> 27:54.020
Aside from that viral video

27:54.063 --> 27:56.196
of cops arresting
an innocent black man,

27:56.239 --> 27:58.024
you don't even have a "he said,
he said" here, Counselor.

27:58.067 --> 28:00.896
Your vic's in a coma.
- Let's go.

28:07.555 --> 28:10.253
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:11.298 --> 28:13.169
Thanks for meeting me.
- Of course.

28:13.213 --> 28:15.389
- I know it's been a long day.
- Yeah.

28:15.432 --> 28:17.217
- Where are we?

28:17.260 --> 28:19.306
- We arrested Joe Murphy.

28:19.349 --> 28:20.916
He admitted to sex with Aquino

28:20.960 --> 28:22.657
but denies
having assaulted him.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.050
- And Aquino's
still unconscious?

28:24.093 --> 28:26.792
- Yes.

28:26.835 --> 28:28.881
- It may be better
if Sergeant Tutuola

28:28.924 --> 28:30.404
testifies at the grand jury.

28:30.447 --> 28:31.971
- [laughs]

28:32.014 --> 28:34.277
Rather than a white woman,
Captain?

28:40.806 --> 28:43.417
- How'd it go at IAB?

28:43.460 --> 28:45.114
- What have you heard?

28:45.158 --> 28:47.900
- Not a word, which worries me.

28:47.943 --> 28:50.076
- Chief, I didn't sleep
last night.

28:50.119 --> 28:53.035
Been going over and over
and over in my head

28:53.079 --> 28:55.429
about what happened
in that park,

28:55.472 --> 28:56.996
and trying to figure out

28:57.039 --> 28:58.606
what I could've
done differently,

28:58.649 --> 29:00.695
and...

29:00.739 --> 29:02.784
And what I missed.

29:02.828 --> 29:04.568
- And what do you think?

29:04.612 --> 29:07.267
- I think that I
have been so focused

29:07.310 --> 29:09.225
on the victims

29:09.269 --> 29:12.489
that my own bias

29:12.533 --> 29:14.665
didn't even occur to me.

29:14.709 --> 29:16.624
- And now?

29:16.667 --> 29:20.454
- I don't know.

29:20.497 --> 29:22.195
How much did that bias

29:22.238 --> 29:24.240
affect my choices,

29:24.284 --> 29:27.026
affect my decisions

29:27.069 --> 29:30.333
as a cop?

29:30.377 --> 29:33.249
I'm reeling.

29:33.293 --> 29:35.208
- We all are.

29:37.210 --> 29:40.126
The level
of community outrage...

29:40.169 --> 29:43.477
There's a freight train coming.
[laughs]

29:43.520 --> 29:45.784
1PP senses it too.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.307
My worry is,

29:47.350 --> 29:49.657
they're more interested in
the optics than actual change.

29:49.700 --> 29:52.312
- Is that why you had Fin

29:52.355 --> 29:54.314
tell me to watch my back?

29:56.011 --> 29:58.840
- When an organization
feels threatened,

29:58.884 --> 30:00.842
if they believe they can
protect themselves

30:00.886 --> 30:02.975
by sacrificing a few pawns,

30:03.018 --> 30:05.325
they will not hesitate.

30:10.678 --> 30:13.637
- You worked with Eric Aquino.

30:13.681 --> 30:15.770
- He's selfless.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.337
A gentle soul.

30:17.380 --> 30:20.644
- Can you describe
his injuries?

30:20.688 --> 30:22.516
- A head wound so severe

30:22.559 --> 30:25.432
that he still hasn't
regained consciousness

30:25.475 --> 30:28.696
and anal trauma consistent
with sexual assault.

30:28.739 --> 30:31.046
- Was there DNA?

30:31.090 --> 30:33.048
- Joe Murphy's DNA was a match

30:33.092 --> 30:35.877
for the semen found
in Aquino's underwear.

30:35.921 --> 30:38.793
- Mr. Aquino is unable
to testify here today.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.665
Can you tell us what happened
when the police discovered him?

30:41.709 --> 30:43.015
- He was bleeding
from the head.

30:43.058 --> 30:45.017
His pants were down and bloody.

30:45.060 --> 30:46.932
He was able to make
a brief statement

30:46.975 --> 30:48.150
which led us to proceed

30:48.194 --> 30:50.718
with the sexual assault
investigation.

30:50.761 --> 30:51.719
- Thank you, Sergeant.

30:51.762 --> 30:54.069
- Can I ask a question?

30:54.113 --> 30:57.464
- You can ask me, and I'll--
- That's okay, I'll ask.

30:57.507 --> 30:59.640
Did the victim say
who had assaulted him?

30:59.683 --> 31:01.903
- No.
- But isn't this the case

31:01.947 --> 31:03.731
where you arrested
Jayvon Brown first?

31:03.774 --> 31:05.472
- The police were called.

31:05.515 --> 31:07.300
He had outstanding warrants.

31:07.343 --> 31:08.997
- So you all assume
it was a black man

31:09.041 --> 31:11.043
just because he was there?

31:11.086 --> 31:12.783
- We didn't know
what we were looking at.

31:12.827 --> 31:14.133
- So why should we
believe you now?

31:14.176 --> 31:16.962
- Miss, there's a process here,

31:17.005 --> 31:18.746
and if you have questions,
you need to--

31:18.789 --> 31:21.053
- I have a lot of questions.

31:21.096 --> 31:22.924
The only reason Jayvon
was arrested

31:22.968 --> 31:24.056
was because of that Karen

31:24.099 --> 31:25.448
saying she was threatened,
right?

31:25.492 --> 31:27.494
- That is not relevant
to these proceedings,

31:27.537 --> 31:29.235
and the Sergeant does not
have to answer that.

31:30.932 --> 31:32.673
- Jayvon Brown was arrested

31:32.716 --> 31:34.588
according to standard
police procedure.

31:34.631 --> 31:36.024
- [laughs]

31:36.068 --> 31:37.939
"Police procedure"?

31:37.983 --> 31:39.158
The same procedure you used

31:39.201 --> 31:40.333
when you shot
that boy's father,

31:40.376 --> 31:42.291
another black man
in the projects?

31:50.647 --> 31:52.519
- That was a train wreck.

31:52.562 --> 31:55.000
You know I'm losing control
of the grand jury?

31:55.043 --> 31:56.958
- Was not my idea to testify.

31:57.002 --> 31:58.307
- Because you didn't agree
with the way

31:58.351 --> 32:00.353
Jayvon's arrest went down?
- I didn't say that.

32:00.396 --> 32:01.920
- No, but the grand jury
all heard it.

32:01.963 --> 32:03.878
- Well, even if they did,
Joe Murphy is guilty.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.445
That has nothing to do
with Jayvon.

32:05.488 --> 32:07.926
- Try saying that in there.

32:09.057 --> 32:10.754
Don't you see
they're looking for reasons

32:10.798 --> 32:12.191
not to trust the cops
right now,

32:12.234 --> 32:14.497
and when you--
when you get on the stand,

32:14.541 --> 32:16.935
and you testify like
you're being held hostage,

32:16.978 --> 32:18.545
that doesn't help me
get the indictment!

32:18.588 --> 32:20.025
- Is that what this is about?
'Cause I'm sorry, Counselor,

32:20.068 --> 32:21.113
if we didn't give this case
to you wrapped up

32:21.156 --> 32:22.941
in a nice little bow.
- Fin.

32:22.984 --> 32:25.291
If you had second thoughts
about arresting Jayvon,

32:25.334 --> 32:27.684
you should've told me
before you went up there.

32:27.728 --> 32:29.164
- Maybe you should know.

32:29.208 --> 32:30.861
After all your years
of being a cop,

32:30.905 --> 32:31.993
you've never seen
black cops stand back

32:32.037 --> 32:33.081
during stop and frisk?

32:33.125 --> 32:34.082
- Oh, what does this
have to do with me?

32:34.126 --> 32:35.475
- I'm just saying.

32:35.518 --> 32:36.998
You can take a cop out
of Staten Island...

32:37.042 --> 32:37.999
- What, are you
calling me racist?

32:38.043 --> 32:39.174
What the hell is that, huh?

32:39.218 --> 32:40.480
- No, no, no, no.
No one is saying that!

32:40.523 --> 32:42.612
- Folks, calm down.
You're making a scene.

32:42.656 --> 32:44.875
- I'm in the middle
of a grand jury, Mr. Freddo.

32:44.919 --> 32:46.181
What are you doing here?

32:46.225 --> 32:48.444
- Breaking news:
my client decided to testify.

32:48.488 --> 32:49.837
- Oh, really?

32:49.880 --> 32:51.708
Does he understand that
he has to waive immunity?

32:51.752 --> 32:54.624
- He knows.
Buckle up, Sonny.

32:56.061 --> 32:57.932
- Perp walking in
to a grand jury?

32:57.976 --> 32:59.281
Something's up.

32:59.325 --> 33:02.502
- Well, whatever lies
Murphy tells,

33:02.545 --> 33:04.069
he's locked into a trial.

33:04.112 --> 33:06.158
- If this goes to trial.

33:06.201 --> 33:09.552
They're rolling the dice
that I won't get an indictment.

33:16.690 --> 33:18.126
- Yes.
Okay.

33:18.170 --> 33:19.954
I lied to the police.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.651
I had met Mr. Aquino in a bar,

33:21.695 --> 33:23.784
and he and I did walk
into the park together.

33:23.827 --> 33:25.655
- And didn't you also lie

33:25.699 --> 33:27.962
about what happened
once you got to the park?

33:28.006 --> 33:30.008
- Yes.

33:30.051 --> 33:33.054
And this is not easy for me.

33:33.098 --> 33:36.057
The truth is
we were drunk, high.

33:36.101 --> 33:39.539
He unzipped me,
initiated a sexual encounter.

33:39.582 --> 33:42.629
- And so you lied to the cops
about that too, right?

33:45.284 --> 33:47.155
- I was ashamed.

33:47.199 --> 33:49.201
My fiancée, my mom,

33:49.244 --> 33:52.334
I didn't want them to know...

33:53.814 --> 33:56.338
I'm bi.

33:56.382 --> 33:58.688
- I appreciate your bravery

33:58.732 --> 34:00.516
in outing yourself here today,

34:00.560 --> 34:02.953
but can you tell us truthfully

34:02.997 --> 34:06.522
what happened after
your sexual encounter?

34:06.566 --> 34:09.482
- Nothing.
Nothing happened after that.

34:09.525 --> 34:10.700
- I'm sorry, what?

34:10.744 --> 34:12.137
- Eric and I had
a brief sexual moment.

34:12.180 --> 34:14.530
I'm not proud of it,
but like I said, I was drunk.

34:14.574 --> 34:17.098
I zipped up.
I went home to my fiancée.

34:17.142 --> 34:19.013
I have no idea what happened
to Eric after that.

34:19.057 --> 34:21.885
- Mr. Murphy, didn't you
tell the detectives

34:21.929 --> 34:23.974
that Eric had gotten
aggressive with you,

34:24.018 --> 34:25.106
and you pushed him off?

34:25.150 --> 34:26.151
- Yeah, well,
I was just telling them

34:26.194 --> 34:27.500
what they wanted to hear.

34:27.543 --> 34:30.372
- You mean you lied again?

34:30.416 --> 34:33.114
Okay, so basically, today,

34:33.158 --> 34:35.377
you have admitted
to every detail

34:35.421 --> 34:36.726
of your encounter

34:36.770 --> 34:39.642
until the point that
Eric Aquino was assaulted.

34:39.686 --> 34:40.904
I'm sorry, but this sounds

34:40.948 --> 34:42.950
like you're admitting
what you can't deny

34:42.993 --> 34:44.430
and denying
what you can't admit,

34:44.473 --> 34:46.214
so why--why should
we believe you now?

34:46.258 --> 34:48.695
- The confession was coerced.

34:50.653 --> 34:52.612
One of the cops told me
they were mad at me

34:52.655 --> 34:54.092
for filming Jayvon's arrest.

34:54.135 --> 34:56.398
They got a lot of flack
for arresting him,

34:56.442 --> 34:57.921
and I was going to have
to take the fall.

34:57.965 --> 35:01.011
- So even though
Eric Aquino was raped,

35:01.055 --> 35:03.101
and is still in a coma,

35:03.144 --> 35:04.319
you're the victim here?

35:04.363 --> 35:06.669
That is your testimony?
- No.

35:08.323 --> 35:10.499
We're all victims here.

35:12.414 --> 35:15.287
Eric, Jayvon, and me.

35:15.330 --> 35:16.375
- Mr. Murphy,
we've heard enough.

35:16.418 --> 35:18.377
Thank you.
- Excuse me.

35:18.420 --> 35:20.988
Let the man finish.

35:26.907 --> 35:29.518
- I'm horrified about
what happened to Eric,

35:29.562 --> 35:31.303
but that has nothing
to do with me.

35:31.346 --> 35:33.174
I did not hurt him.

35:33.218 --> 35:34.958
That's why I came in today

35:35.002 --> 35:37.613
even though my lawyer
advised me not to.

35:43.750 --> 35:46.318
The cops are lying to you.

35:50.017 --> 35:52.019
I'm not.

36:11.299 --> 36:13.475
- [sighs]

36:13.519 --> 36:16.348
- This your new office?

36:17.349 --> 36:19.264
- Take a seat.

36:19.307 --> 36:21.004
- How you doing?

36:21.048 --> 36:22.789
- Not good.

36:22.832 --> 36:24.834
- It's only been a few hours.

36:24.878 --> 36:27.707
- For a grand jury,
that is a lifetime.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.883
He lied through his teeth.

36:29.926 --> 36:32.538
He knew exactly
what cards to play.

36:32.581 --> 36:33.843
The more I went after him,

36:33.887 --> 36:36.324
the more the grand jurors
sympathized with him.

36:36.368 --> 36:38.021
- Juries are smart, Dominick.

36:38.065 --> 36:40.459
- Usually.

36:40.502 --> 36:42.635
But they're so mad
at the NYPD right now,

36:42.678 --> 36:44.114
they wanna punish us.

36:44.158 --> 36:46.726
- Hey, Sonny.
Well, win some, lose some.

36:46.769 --> 36:48.467
Warden just told me
they voted No Bill.

36:48.510 --> 36:49.859
Joey walks.

36:49.903 --> 36:52.949
You should've taken
the mis-d, kiddo.

36:56.953 --> 36:58.216
- It's not over.

36:58.259 --> 37:00.914
- No, it's not.

37:00.957 --> 37:03.351
Somebody still needs to tell
Eric Aquino's family

37:03.395 --> 37:05.658
what just happened.

37:08.182 --> 37:11.011
- This man leaves my son
to die, and he goes free?

37:11.054 --> 37:12.099
How could this happen?

37:12.142 --> 37:13.622
- He told the grand jury
we framed him.

37:13.666 --> 37:15.624
- And they believed him
over the police.

37:15.668 --> 37:18.540
- It's a complicated time.

37:18.584 --> 37:20.238
- I don't understand.

37:20.281 --> 37:22.718
- What she means, Mom,
is NYPD screwed up.

37:22.762 --> 37:23.763
- Mark Peter, be polite.

37:23.806 --> 37:25.591
- This is all on you!

37:25.634 --> 37:26.809
If you hadn't arrested
Jayvon Brown,

37:26.853 --> 37:29.464
none of this would've happened,
would it?

37:40.432 --> 37:43.783
- Hey, Noah.
Time for bed, honey.

37:45.611 --> 37:48.918
What are you watching?

37:48.962 --> 37:52.879
- The video of you
arresting the wrong guy.

37:54.402 --> 37:57.144
Everybody at school's seen it.

38:00.147 --> 38:02.454
- Okay.

38:06.109 --> 38:08.677
You wanna talk about it?

38:08.721 --> 38:12.725
- Why did you arrest him?

38:12.768 --> 38:16.294
- [sighs]
- Are you racist?

38:16.337 --> 38:18.252
- Noah...

38:18.296 --> 38:20.559
Come on.

38:20.602 --> 38:22.996
Noah, you know that I'm not.

38:24.911 --> 38:27.957
- Did you tell him
you're sorry?

38:30.177 --> 38:31.613
- There's a lawsuit,

38:31.657 --> 38:35.443
and my bosses told me that I--

38:35.487 --> 38:37.924
that I shouldn't talk to him.

38:39.360 --> 38:40.883
- Why?

38:40.927 --> 38:44.670
You always tell me to apologize
when I do something wrong.

38:50.415 --> 38:53.505

38:56.464 --> 38:57.639
Can I talk to you?

38:57.683 --> 38:58.858
- [sighs]

38:58.901 --> 39:00.294
Don't you have anything
better to do

39:00.338 --> 39:02.383
than pressure me
into dropping my complaint?

39:02.427 --> 39:04.516
- That's not why I'm here.

39:06.518 --> 39:08.998
- So you know I got laid off.

39:09.042 --> 39:12.698
Somehow it was all in
the papers that I'm in NA.

39:12.741 --> 39:14.917
- I'm sorry,
and I can call your boss--

39:14.961 --> 39:16.658
- Don't.

39:16.702 --> 39:18.181
You've done enough.

39:21.228 --> 39:23.361

39:23.404 --> 39:26.842
that the DA is pursuing charges
against Colleen Reynolds

39:26.886 --> 39:28.975
for filing a false report.

39:30.542 --> 39:32.674
- Okay,

39:32.718 --> 39:34.502
so--so I lose my job,

39:34.546 --> 39:36.156
Murphy walks,

39:36.199 --> 39:38.985
and now you think
you can just distract everyone

39:39.028 --> 39:41.901
and claim some moral high
ground by charging that woman?

39:44.599 --> 39:47.646
- The NYPD has...
