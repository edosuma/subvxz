<i>And now we continue
our ongoing coverage</i>

00:55.222 --> 00:58.390
<i>of the opioid epidemic ravaging
the heartland of America.</i>

00:58.392 --> 00:59.792
<i>In recent years,</i>

00:59.794 --> 01:01.627
<i>drug overdoses have surpassed</i>

01:01.629 --> 01:04.329
<i>all vehicle and gun-related
deaths.</i>

01:04.331 --> 01:07.600
<i>On average, hundreds
of people die every day.</i>

01:07.602 --> 01:09.134
<i>Now, for these reasons,</i>

01:09.136 --> 01:11.369
<i>the president signed
an executive order</i>

01:11.371 --> 01:14.874
<i>combatting the drug addiction
and opioid crisis.</i>

01:14.876 --> 01:17.543
<i>Many of the street drugs
are laced with fentanyl,</i>

01:17.545 --> 01:19.812
<i>adding to the rising
overdose rate.</i>

01:19.814 --> 01:21.781
<i>Opioids, even prescribed ones,</i>

01:21.783 --> 01:24.917
<i>if misused,
the consequences can be deadly.</i>

01:24.919 --> 01:26.652
<i>And now another
heartbreaking story</i>

01:26.654 --> 01:28.153
<i>from Whispering Pines.</i>

01:28.155 --> 01:29.454
<i>The story of a mother</i>

01:29.456 --> 01:32.390
<i>who lost both of her sons
in 12 hours.</i>

01:32.392 --> 01:34.827
<i>We couldn't get a comment
from Hazel Pratt,</i>

01:34.829 --> 01:37.897
<i>but we now go live to another

01:37.899 --> 01:39.364
<i>Sir, can you
and your daughter</i>

01:39.366 --> 01:41.601
<i>please tell us
exactly what happened here?</i>

01:41.603 --> 01:44.469
<i>I don't think my daughter is up
for any questions right now.</i>

01:44.471 --> 01:46.404
<i>But I'll tell ya what.</i>

01:46.406 --> 01:48.674
<i>No one should be dyin'
in the eighth grade.</i>

01:48.676 --> 01:50.910
<i>A truly
heartbreaking story.</i>

01:50.912 --> 01:53.178
<i>But unfortunately
not the last to report</i>

01:53.180 --> 01:54.847
<i>on the local opioid epidemic.</i>

01:54.849 --> 01:56.348
<i>It has just been reported</i>

01:56.350 --> 01:58.450
<i>that another violent,
drug-related crime</i>

01:58.452 --> 02:00.586
<i>took the life
of Bruce Williamson.</i>

02:00.588 --> 02:02.387
<i>A World War II veteran
was murdered</i>

02:02.389 --> 02:04.857
<i>during a home invasion
last night.</i>

02:04.859 --> 02:07.258
<i>He was alone.
He was attacked in his home.</i>

02:38.392 --> 02:40.258
Come on out,
you son of a bitch.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.393
Paul, wait!

02:41.395 --> 02:42.528
And I'm gonna give you

02:42.530 --> 02:43.796
what the fuck
you got comin' to ya.

02:43.798 --> 02:45.399
No!

02:59.013 --> 03:03.616
"It was a dangerous journey,
but they needed to save Narnia.

03:03.618 --> 03:04.850
"The battle was fierce,

03:04.852 --> 03:06.986
but with Peter, Susan,
Edmund, and Lucy's help,

03:06.988 --> 03:09.622
Aslan and his army
brought peace back to Narnia.

03:09.624 --> 03:12.457
Look... there's Aslan again.

03:12.459 --> 03:13.959
Who's that?
It kinda looks like you.

03:13.961 --> 03:16.829
The end.

03:16.831 --> 03:18.329
Say "yay"!

03:18.331 --> 03:20.432
- Yay.
- Yay. All right, buddy.

03:20.434 --> 03:21.634
Let's go to bed.

03:26.774 --> 03:28.607
Gimme a hug.

03:29.877 --> 03:30.778
I love you.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.347
Love you.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.854
Dada.

04:09.349 --> 04:10.450
Hey.

04:13.054 --> 04:14.655
Who were you expecting?

04:15.823 --> 04:16.824
No one.

04:18.059 --> 04:20.793
Things have gotten
that bad, huh?

04:20.795 --> 04:22.427
Yep.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.396
Sorry.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.768
Me, too. Uh,
you want a beer or somethin'? I can...

04:28.770 --> 04:31.771
No, actually...
I've got some bad news.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.440
It's your sister.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.390
Now, what is that?

04:52.392 --> 04:53.993
Morphine.

04:53.995 --> 04:55.426
You know
she's an addict.

04:55.428 --> 04:56.996
It's just to take
the edge off.

04:56.998 --> 04:58.363
I'll be fine.

04:58.365 --> 04:59.932
How long were you clean?

04:59.934 --> 05:01.801
I'm still clean.

05:01.803 --> 05:06.138
Three years, one month,
and 12 days... ish.

05:06.140 --> 05:09.342
Hmm. And you're jeopardizing
that for some painkillers.

05:10.278 --> 05:12.613
If you felt what I was
feeling, you'd ask for a gun.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.615
I just want you
to be careful.

05:16.617 --> 05:20.119
It's just until
I heal up, okay?

05:20.121 --> 05:22.121
I'll hold you to that.

05:22.123 --> 05:24.457
I see you have custody.

05:25.960 --> 05:29.061
Shh! Yes,
I have custody.

05:29.063 --> 05:32.164
You sure know
how to pick 'em.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.699
Third time's the charm,
I guess, right?

05:33.701 --> 05:35.466
No. No, no,
no, no, no.

05:35.468 --> 05:36.936
Two. That's fine.

05:36.938 --> 05:38.771
I'll hold you to that.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.107
TouchÃ©.

05:43.778 --> 05:45.711
How much of that stuff
are you injecting?

05:45.713 --> 05:49.648
Hmm.
As much as it takes.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.786
Okay...

05:52.687 --> 05:55.554
All right, well,
I got registration for daycare in an hour.

05:55.556 --> 05:58.691
I gotta get Phil ready.

05:58.693 --> 06:00.659
You know you can come back
when the family's here.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.628
I could.

06:02.630 --> 06:03.564
But I won't.

06:04.832 --> 06:07.566
Come on, buddy.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.068
You can keep that.

06:09.070 --> 06:11.203
Can you say bye?

06:11.205 --> 06:13.038
- Bye.
- Good-bye...

06:14.208 --> 06:17.576
Get better, all right?
Feel better.

06:17.578 --> 06:18.577
We kinda need you.

06:18.579 --> 06:19.812
Mm.

06:19.814 --> 06:20.980
Later, dumb-ass.

06:20.982 --> 06:23.949
Later, dumb-ass.

06:25.920 --> 06:27.553
<i>We have breaking news
at this hour</i>

06:27.555 --> 06:29.188
<i>on the sentencing
of Paul Davis,</i>

06:29.190 --> 06:30.689
<i>who murdered his neighbor</i>

06:30.691 --> 06:32.925
<i>in connection
with drug trafficking.</i>

06:32.927 --> 06:35.861
<i>Paul has been convicted
of murder in the first degree</i>

06:35.863 --> 06:37.997
<i>and is facing life in prison.</i>

06:37.999 --> 06:40.766
<i>Now, this trial has divided
the community of Whispering Pines</i>

06:40.768 --> 06:43.535
<i>with some locals
calling Paul a hero</i>

06:43.537 --> 06:46.105
<i>for taking justice
into his own hands.</i>

06:54.148 --> 06:58.217
Well, aren't you
a sight for sore eyes.

06:58.219 --> 06:59.518
Lieutenant,
how the hell are you?

06:59.520 --> 07:01.553
I'm good, man.
How you doin'?

07:01.555 --> 07:02.588
I'm all right.

07:02.590 --> 07:03.822
You've been
all over the globe.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.557
Yeah, three tours,

07:05.559 --> 07:07.259
two ex-wives.

07:07.261 --> 07:08.627
I got a son now.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.663
- Hey, that's great.
- So...

07:10.665 --> 07:12.531
I'm right back here
in the fuckin' Pines.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.700
Mm-hmm.
I saw your mom.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.636
What'd she have to say?

07:17.638 --> 07:19.907
Oh, said you were laying low,
taking care of your sister.

07:21.575 --> 07:23.909
Yeah.

07:23.911 --> 07:27.947
Yeah. Things have gotten
a little crazy around here.

07:27.949 --> 07:30.149
- Lots of drugs.
- No shit!

07:30.151 --> 07:31.283
I leave for a few years,

07:31.285 --> 07:32.818
you let everything
go to hell, Jerry.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.688
Last week, eighth-grader...

07:35.690 --> 07:38.657
ODs in the boys' bathroom
at school.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.626
Eighth grade?

07:40.628 --> 07:42.695
- Yeah.
- Damn.

07:43.998 --> 07:45.230
I only got a couple more
years of this shit,

07:45.232 --> 07:47.068
and then I'm outta here.

07:48.602 --> 07:49.837
Another.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.039
Sorry about that, Ed.

07:55.609 --> 07:56.875
Do you want one?

07:56.877 --> 07:59.111
No. Thank you.
I gotta get back.

07:59.113 --> 08:01.981
Um, I'm gonna
catch you up. I owe you.

08:01.983 --> 08:04.016
Okay?

08:04.018 --> 08:08.153
Why you ain't out there
arrestin' all them pushers?

08:08.155 --> 08:09.688
On what charges?

08:09.690 --> 08:12.124
Dealing heroin,
dumb-ass.

08:12.126 --> 08:15.828
Hey... we're on different
sides of the fence, okay?

08:15.830 --> 08:18.764
But you respect me,
and I respect you.

08:18.766 --> 08:19.832
Got that?

08:19.834 --> 08:21.867
You just keep
filling up our jails

08:21.869 --> 08:24.203
with the wrong people.

08:24.205 --> 08:28.007
I never see the drug
dealers down at that prison.

08:28.009 --> 08:29.074
Why?

08:29.076 --> 08:31.610
Because I'm by myself.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.278
I have to catch them
in the act.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.614
I got news
for you, copper:

08:35.616 --> 08:38.050
A old pickup,
the hood's down,

08:38.052 --> 08:39.318
out of tar.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.854
Hood's up, his store
is open for business.

08:41.856 --> 08:44.289
Exactly...
and you got me

08:44.291 --> 08:46.592
tryin' to clean up
this mess, alone.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.293
What do you
want me to do?

08:48.295 --> 08:52.965
By any means necessary.

08:52.967 --> 08:54.833
Yeah, okay.

08:54.835 --> 08:56.001
Paul did it.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.936
And look at him now.

09:04.178 --> 09:06.947
Nothing new
under the sun.

09:11.152 --> 09:12.384
He's not wrong.

09:16.857 --> 09:19.058
Please welcome
Hazel Pratt.

09:20.261 --> 09:22.061
I-I spent my life,

09:22.063 --> 09:24.730
other than
raising my sons,

09:24.732 --> 09:28.200
saving lives in the ER.

09:28.202 --> 09:32.071
I lost...
my two sons

09:32.073 --> 09:33.741
in 12 hours.

09:35.176 --> 09:37.878
From...
From the same needle.

09:39.013 --> 09:41.647
And now, I spend my time

09:41.649 --> 09:43.348
talking to you kids,

09:43.350 --> 09:46.118
hoping that you won't use

09:46.120 --> 09:48.153
and end up dead, too.

09:51.859 --> 09:54.059
Hey... hello, you.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.995
Why don't you
stand up?

09:56.997 --> 09:58.831
Yeah, you, the one
that's, you know, laughing

09:58.833 --> 10:01.433
and not paying attention...
stand up.

10:01.435 --> 10:04.136
Whatever.

10:04.138 --> 10:05.237
Excuse me?

10:05.239 --> 10:06.905
Sorry.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.907
What's your mother's name?

10:08.909 --> 10:10.409
Lisa.

10:10.411 --> 10:11.712
Lisa.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.447
Do you hate
your mother Lisa?

10:15.449 --> 10:17.416
No, of...
of course not.

10:17.418 --> 10:20.752
Well, do you hate
your friends' mothers?

10:20.754 --> 10:22.054
No, ma'am.

10:22.056 --> 10:24.056
'Cause I don't think that
they'd be, you know,

10:24.058 --> 10:27.126
really happy to see that
you're not paying any attention

10:27.128 --> 10:30.229
to what could be the most
important lesson

10:30.231 --> 10:32.264
that you've
ever had all year.

10:32.266 --> 10:34.166
Something that could
save your life,

10:34.168 --> 10:36.768
or... or save
your friends' lives.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.437
What lesson?

10:38.439 --> 10:42.274
The lesson
that if you do heroin,

10:42.276 --> 10:44.309
even once,

10:44.311 --> 10:47.980
you're going to ruin
the rest of your life.

10:47.982 --> 10:50.182
And you're gonna break
your mother's heart

10:50.184 --> 10:54.853
and devastate her
for the rest of her days!

10:54.855 --> 10:57.055
Is that
what you wanna do?

10:57.057 --> 10:58.425
No.

11:00.127 --> 11:01.493
You can sit down.

11:17.244 --> 11:21.079
Ah. Man, there's not enough beer
for these cold winters.

11:23.417 --> 11:25.286
Should bring
a fifth next time.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.257
Yeah.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.493
Hey, man, are you, uh...

11:34.495 --> 11:36.895
are you serious about
goin' spottin' after midnight?

11:36.897 --> 11:38.096
Best time
to catch those deer,

11:38.098 --> 11:39.398
when they're caught
in the headlights.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.366
It's also
illegal as shit.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.836
The odds of Jerry being
out here at this time

11:44.838 --> 11:47.139
in this part
of the woods is...

11:47.141 --> 11:49.074
zero to none.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.376
Edward, are you
all right with this?

11:51.378 --> 11:54.446
You work at a prison.
Don't you gotta, you know,

11:54.448 --> 11:57.182
follow all the laws
and shit?

11:57.184 --> 11:59.484
Hey, the world
is fucked up.

11:59.486 --> 12:02.354
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah, it is.

12:02.356 --> 12:04.022
See the news
the other day?

12:04.024 --> 12:05.190
You talkin' about Paul?

12:05.192 --> 12:06.959
He's doing life...

12:06.961 --> 12:09.094
for... for giving a damn
about our town.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.429
Yeah, that's
fucked up, man.

12:10.431 --> 12:12.431
- Yeah it is.
- Wait, so...

12:12.433 --> 12:14.900
You guys think
what Paul did...

12:14.902 --> 12:17.102
uh... breaking into
his neighbor's house

12:17.104 --> 12:21.473
in the middle of the night
and murdering him...

12:21.475 --> 12:23.310
you think that's right?

12:24.845 --> 12:26.280
Yeah.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.916
Redneck fuckin' justice.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.885
You serious?

12:33.887 --> 12:35.921
Dead.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.328
Hey, who was that?

12:43.330 --> 12:45.964
Adam. That was a...
friend of mine.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.167
What are you doin'?

12:49.036 --> 12:50.135
Where's Phil?

12:50.137 --> 12:51.506
I was just about
to get him.

13:05.052 --> 13:06.920
Don't fuckin'
touch him.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.164
It's just until
the pain goes away.

13:52.166 --> 13:53.566
Fuck!

13:53.568 --> 13:55.601
They canceled
my insurance!

13:55.603 --> 13:57.069
They canceled
your insurance, great.

13:57.071 --> 13:58.070
Then just throw
your fuckin' life away.

13:58.072 --> 14:00.305
Fuck you!

14:00.307 --> 14:02.407
You don't know
what this is like!

14:02.409 --> 14:04.242
You know
that's not true!

14:04.244 --> 14:06.111
- It was always so...
- Don't gimme that bullshit.

14:06.113 --> 14:07.479
- Where is it?
- It was always so easy for you.

14:07.481 --> 14:09.948
- Where is it?!
- It's... there's not...

14:09.950 --> 14:11.517
There's no more!

14:11.519 --> 14:13.020
I finished it!

14:17.991 --> 14:19.226
Fuck!

14:23.297 --> 14:24.231
Is this it?

14:37.177 --> 14:39.010
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.613
And I swear to God,
Cheyenne,

14:40.615 --> 14:42.049
if you lie to me...

14:44.418 --> 14:46.652
Is there
anything else?

14:46.654 --> 14:49.624
No. No.

14:54.729 --> 14:56.294
Let's find out.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.665
No, there's
nothing in...

14:59.133 --> 15:00.432
There's nothing there.

15:00.434 --> 15:01.601
- I told you, there's nothing.
- Let's find out.

15:04.138 --> 15:05.439
Stop!

15:08.242 --> 15:10.077
Stop, it's nothing,
there's nothing...

15:11.412 --> 15:12.479
I said...

15:14.982 --> 15:15.916
Adam, it's just...

15:17.317 --> 15:19.253
Stop, I said stop!

15:23.257 --> 15:24.592
I swear to God.

15:26.628 --> 15:28.495
Stop!
I said there's...

15:43.545 --> 15:45.446
I can't help it.

15:47.649 --> 15:49.582
- You can fuckin' help this.
- Please don't leave.

15:49.584 --> 15:51.084
Please don't...

15:52.419 --> 15:55.086
Please don't leave me!
Please...

16:37.164 --> 16:38.432
Stop!

17:09.196 --> 17:12.532
<i>It's hard to know what
to say in situations like this.</i>

17:12.534 --> 17:14.867
<i>We all want answers.</i>

17:14.869 --> 17:17.670
<i>The Lord numbers our days.</i>

17:17.672 --> 17:19.872
<i>And yet His timing today
seems premature</i>

17:19.874 --> 17:23.375
<i>for such a loving daughter,
sister...</i>

17:23.377 --> 17:25.745
<i>and young woman.</i>

17:25.747 --> 17:27.515
None of us know our time.

17:30.518 --> 17:31.719
Cheyenne had a good heart.

17:34.254 --> 17:37.422
And though she wasn't amongst
us often on Sundays,

17:37.424 --> 17:39.559
she knew...

17:39.561 --> 17:40.793
she knew her life
had a greater purpose

17:40.795 --> 17:42.329
in the eyes of God.

17:44.599 --> 17:47.500
It's hard to measure
the impact

17:47.502 --> 17:49.535
of one's life and death

17:49.537 --> 17:52.337
for the ones left behind.

17:52.339 --> 17:55.407
But the little
I knew of Cheyenne...

17:55.409 --> 17:58.209
I always enjoyed
her sense of humor,

17:58.211 --> 18:00.546
her loud laugh...

18:00.548 --> 18:03.415
and I appreciated
her donations

18:03.417 --> 18:06.552
at our wild game dinners.

18:06.554 --> 18:10.890
No one knows why Cheyenne
succumbed to her addiction...

18:10.892 --> 18:13.826
We sure as hell do!

18:13.828 --> 18:16.396
Those filthy
fucking dealers!

18:17.765 --> 18:19.464
And you!

18:19.466 --> 18:21.433
You, Adam!

18:21.435 --> 18:23.168
I asked you
to take care of her.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.504
I asked you to watch out
for your sister!

18:25.506 --> 18:27.673
And what did you do?

18:27.675 --> 18:29.942
Now's the time
to celebrate Cheyenne's life.

18:29.944 --> 18:32.912
No one here is responsible
for what happened.

18:32.914 --> 18:34.682
Nah, she's right.

18:37.852 --> 18:39.319
No, she's right.

18:40.788 --> 18:42.523
It was my fault.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.961
And it's your fault, Ma.

18:48.963 --> 18:51.196
And it's your fault.
And it's your fault.

18:51.198 --> 18:52.665
- Ted...
- Adam...

18:52.667 --> 18:54.702
Shut the fuck up, Ted!

18:55.870 --> 18:57.639
- Hey, don't do this now...
- You too!

19:02.610 --> 19:04.810
Cheyenne was doomed.

19:04.812 --> 19:07.147
The second she was born here,
she was doomed.

19:21.395 --> 19:23.829
- Adam!
- <i>What?</i>

19:23.831 --> 19:26.297
What the fuck you doin'?

19:26.299 --> 19:28.534
<i>Nothin', what are you doin'?</i>

19:28.536 --> 19:30.268
I'll come by
in 15 minutes.

19:30.270 --> 19:32.470
Be out front.
We's goin' out.

19:32.472 --> 19:33.572
<i>No, not tonight.</i>

19:33.574 --> 19:35.777
Yeah, okay. Bye.

19:45.252 --> 19:47.889
Hey, bro! Come on.
Let's get drunk.

19:49.657 --> 19:50.823
Really don't want to.

19:50.825 --> 19:53.025
Oh, yeah, you really do.

19:53.027 --> 19:55.897
Come on, get your skinny ass
in the car right fuckin' now.

20:03.705 --> 20:05.405
Hey, pal.

20:07.909 --> 20:10.442
Shit, this whole road
not have reception?

20:10.444 --> 20:12.945
Yeah, you know,
it's Pennsylvania.

20:12.947 --> 20:15.548
They're still waiting for this
whole cell phone thing to catch on.

20:15.550 --> 20:18.050
Beth is making me pay.

20:18.052 --> 20:20.586
To watch her own grandson.

20:20.588 --> 20:22.855
You know your family
was my favorite.

20:22.857 --> 20:25.356
You always kept me busy.

20:25.358 --> 20:26.926
You're welcome.

20:29.797 --> 20:31.463
So, where the fuck
are we going?

20:31.465 --> 20:33.866
There's this new
hipster bar.

20:33.868 --> 20:36.635
It's Southern-themed.
You're gonna love it.

20:36.637 --> 20:38.369
Oh, boy.

20:39.607 --> 20:41.674
This place is not
very Southern-themed.

20:41.676 --> 20:43.876
Well, that's next.

20:43.878 --> 20:46.612
Patience.
Patience, son.

20:46.614 --> 20:49.882
Man, the dirty
motherfuckers.

20:49.884 --> 20:51.050
Who?

20:51.052 --> 20:52.618
Over there.

20:52.620 --> 20:54.053
The county PD.

20:54.055 --> 20:55.955
They're taking out the sergeant
for his retirement

20:55.957 --> 20:57.723
and they didn't invite me.

20:57.725 --> 21:00.327
So here I am, sittin' here,
lookin' like an asshole.

21:01.062 --> 21:02.460
Thanks.

21:02.462 --> 21:03.896
I didn't mean you.

21:03.898 --> 21:05.097
You know,
it's just the fact

21:05.099 --> 21:07.465
that I'm here,
and they're there.

21:07.467 --> 21:12.403
So... I guess I oughta
go over and buy them a round.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.640
And let them grin
through their shit.

21:14.642 --> 21:16.609
Be right back.
You want another one?

21:16.611 --> 21:18.944
Yeah. Thank you.

21:18.946 --> 21:20.480
You're welcome.

21:22.349 --> 21:24.852
Hello, fellas.
Sarge.

21:26.386 --> 21:29.588
Can I have another pint,
and for my buddy a shot?

21:42.570 --> 21:44.703
Here you go, bro.

21:44.705 --> 21:46.639
Down the hatch.

21:46.641 --> 21:48.042
Thank you.

22:54.909 --> 22:58.544
Adam... hey.

22:58.546 --> 23:01.146
I didn't know
you worked here.

23:01.148 --> 23:02.982
Yeah, they cut my hours
back in town,

23:02.984 --> 23:04.984
so here I am.

23:04.986 --> 23:07.519
Who has Phil tonight?

23:07.521 --> 23:09.154
Beth.

23:09.156 --> 23:11.190
Thank you for watching him so
much in the last couple weeks.

23:11.192 --> 23:13.192
It's been fuckin' crazy.

23:13.194 --> 23:15.493
Happy to.

23:15.495 --> 23:16.530
Thank you.

23:17.531 --> 23:19.632
Did you come in alone?

23:19.634 --> 23:22.134
No...
Lieutenant's upstairs.

23:22.136 --> 23:24.069
That's funny.

23:24.071 --> 23:25.905
Why?

23:25.907 --> 23:27.206
You two being "friends."

23:27.208 --> 23:30.209
I remember when
he sent you away.

23:30.211 --> 23:31.710
I was a little shit.

23:31.712 --> 23:33.245
Weren't we all,
though?

23:33.247 --> 23:35.549
On me.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.720
You guys are gonna have
to carry me out of here.

23:41.722 --> 23:44.757
Yeah, that
should help, right?

23:44.759 --> 23:47.128
To... drowning
our sorrows.

23:53.167 --> 23:55.567
Oh, I hate tequila.

23:57.905 --> 24:02.074
Hey, I'm really sorry
about your, uh...

24:02.076 --> 24:04.612
your cousins...
I know they were like brothers to you.

24:07.048 --> 24:08.814
Yeah, I don't even recognize
my Aunt Hazel, you know?

24:08.816 --> 24:11.183
I just...

24:11.185 --> 24:13.486
I just feel, like, numb.

24:15.122 --> 24:16.956
Do you feel numb?

24:16.958 --> 24:18.659
I'm trying.

24:22.763 --> 24:23.829
How was the funeral?

24:23.831 --> 24:24.964
Heh.

24:24.966 --> 24:26.499
I'm sorry.

24:30.004 --> 24:32.006
Cheyenne was
my little sister.

24:34.208 --> 24:35.743
My little sister.

24:38.079 --> 24:39.680
My responsibility.

24:41.549 --> 24:44.750
And I left.
I just fuckin' left.

24:44.752 --> 24:46.752
You had to.

24:46.754 --> 24:47.989
Adam!

24:51.192 --> 24:52.893
I gotta go upstairs.

24:55.296 --> 24:57.196
Look, I know
what you're doing.

24:57.198 --> 24:58.699
Don't.

25:03.070 --> 25:05.904
- Young lady.
- Lieutenant.

25:05.906 --> 25:08.841
Nice.

25:08.843 --> 25:10.309
Workin'
on number three?

25:12.146 --> 25:14.346
How was
your circle jerk?

25:14.348 --> 25:16.248
Oh, fuck those guys.

25:16.250 --> 25:19.885
They don't even recognize the
Lone Ranger lost in the woods.

25:19.887 --> 25:23.088
So, uh... you two
do some catching up?

25:23.090 --> 25:25.259
Same old, same old.

25:25.693 --> 25:27.726
Everybody's
fuckin' dying.

25:27.728 --> 25:29.995
Oh, fun stuff.
Nice. You know what?

25:29.997 --> 25:31.930
No more dog shit, okay?

25:31.932 --> 25:34.166
You need a new environment.
Let's go.

25:34.168 --> 25:35.334
Come on.

25:35.336 --> 25:36.668
Dixieland!

25:36.670 --> 25:37.703
That's right.
Come on.

25:37.705 --> 25:38.939
Here I come.

25:41.709 --> 25:44.043
There you go.

25:44.045 --> 25:47.279
See, I am like
a prizefighter.

25:47.281 --> 25:49.214
I save my best for last.

25:54.255 --> 25:56.055
See?

25:56.057 --> 25:58.025
Oh, fuck me.

26:04.165 --> 26:08.033
It's my little island
in the sun.

26:08.035 --> 26:11.572
Hey... this place remind you
of your little Southern town?

26:14.341 --> 26:15.910
No.

26:16.744 --> 26:17.878
Corner pocket.

26:21.782 --> 26:22.981
You win again.

26:22.983 --> 26:25.717
What do you say?
Another round?

26:25.719 --> 26:27.286
Last call,
gentlemen.

26:27.288 --> 26:30.122
- We're closin' up.
- The shit it is.

26:30.124 --> 26:31.890
11:00.

26:31.892 --> 26:33.292
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

26:33.294 --> 26:35.227
Hey, aren't you Adam?

26:35.229 --> 26:37.396
- Yeah.
- Edward's my father.

26:37.398 --> 26:39.231
Really?

26:39.233 --> 26:41.400
No, the other black guy
in town.

26:42.870 --> 26:44.436
Well, it's nice to meet you.
He's a good man.

26:44.438 --> 26:45.671
Yeah, he is.

26:45.673 --> 26:47.773
He told me about
your sister.

26:47.775 --> 26:48.974
- I'm real sorry.
- Ah, jeez.

26:48.976 --> 26:51.176
All right, time to go.
Let's go.

26:51.178 --> 26:54.079
Let's go.
Come on, bro.

26:54.081 --> 26:55.848
âª I know
a great place to go âª

26:55.850 --> 26:57.049
âª A better bar
than this âª

26:57.051 --> 26:58.684
Let's go.

27:04.692 --> 27:06.093
You see
that kid there?

27:07.828 --> 27:09.428
He's barely 16 years old.

27:09.430 --> 27:13.132
He doesn't have any hair
on his balls yet.

27:13.134 --> 27:14.933
You're off duty.

27:14.935 --> 27:16.335
Yeah, lucky for him.

27:16.337 --> 27:18.370
I'd take his ass in.

27:18.372 --> 27:20.706
Good evening, officer.

27:20.708 --> 27:23.342
Ah, hello, fellas.

27:23.344 --> 27:25.711
Sorry, Adam,
about your loss.

27:25.713 --> 27:27.946
Ah, for fuck's sake.
Really?

27:27.948 --> 27:29.148
My brother went to
school with Cheyenne.

27:29.150 --> 27:30.315
She was a sweet girl.

27:30.317 --> 27:32.451
Good. Get lost.
All right?

27:32.453 --> 27:34.088
Before I arrest
both of you.

27:35.189 --> 27:36.421
Fuckin' idiots.

27:36.423 --> 27:39.191
Dicks.

27:39.193 --> 27:41.360
It's unbelievable,
man.

27:41.362 --> 27:42.997
Misery, can't
get away from it.

27:45.132 --> 27:47.199
Small towns.

27:47.201 --> 27:49.434
Yeah, everybody
knows everybody.

27:49.436 --> 27:52.738
<i>Okay, everyone, we're gonna
start the karaoke party again.</i>

27:52.740 --> 27:54.339
Karaoke. Come on,
hang out, man.

27:54.341 --> 27:57.176
We'll do a song.

27:57.178 --> 28:00.479
Think I'm gonna...
get some air.

28:00.481 --> 28:03.949
You sure?
Wanna hang out for one?

28:03.951 --> 28:05.784
Knock yourself out.

28:05.786 --> 28:07.819
All righty, then.
Think I will.

28:09.490 --> 28:11.025
I'll be out in a bit.

28:13.861 --> 28:17.029
Hey... you have
"A Million Miles Away"?

28:17.031 --> 28:18.263
Uh, yeah,
I got that.

28:18.265 --> 28:20.165
- Ah, take some...
- <i>We have a contestant!</i>

28:30.044 --> 28:33.011
<i>âª I wish I had
a time machine âª</i>

28:33.013 --> 28:36.116
<i>âª So I wouldn't
have to dream âª</i>

28:37.552 --> 28:41.987
<i>âª I understand
your need to be âª</i>

28:41.989 --> 28:46.526
<i>âª A million miles
away from me âª</i>

28:46.528 --> 28:50.195
<i>âª The sky was
so brilliant blue âª</i>

28:50.197 --> 28:52.064
Hey, what is that?

28:52.066 --> 28:54.833
Oh, th-this is just
insulin, man.

28:54.835 --> 28:57.469
But, uh, if...
if you need, I, uh...

28:57.471 --> 29:00.405
I know a guy that can hook
you up with some good smack.

29:00.407 --> 29:02.575
- Oh, you know a guy?
- Yeah, I know a guy.

29:02.577 --> 29:05.010
- Is it good shit?
- Oh, is it good, man.

29:05.012 --> 29:06.912
- Is it good?
- It's good!

29:06.914 --> 29:09.915

Fuck you. Yeah.

29:12.486 --> 29:14.386
Fuck you!

29:14.388 --> 29:15.523
What the f...

29:20.327 --> 29:23.462
Uh... fuck you.

29:23.464 --> 29:25.063
Uh, all right, man.

29:25.065 --> 29:26.233
You...

30:13.981 --> 30:15.883
I'm sorry.

30:17.951 --> 30:18.886
I'm so sorry.

30:22.256 --> 30:23.955
I'm so sorry.

30:31.265 --> 30:32.898
Oh, there you are.

30:32.900 --> 30:34.567
You missed it.

30:34.569 --> 30:36.103
The crowd went wild.

30:41.676 --> 30:43.210
What are you
doing down there?

30:46.046 --> 30:47.379
It's not right.

30:47.381 --> 30:49.247
- What?
- It's not right.

30:49.249 --> 30:50.585
What's not right?

30:52.654 --> 30:55.621
These kids, man,
they don't...

30:55.623 --> 30:57.858
they...
they don't know.

30:59.927 --> 31:01.193
Oh, not this again.

31:01.195 --> 31:03.462
They don't know, like,
what they're doing.

31:03.464 --> 31:07.432
- Yeah.
- Getting into this fuckin' shit, man.

31:09.470 --> 31:11.136
Somebody's
gotta do somethin'.

31:13.641 --> 31:15.273
They'll take care of it.

31:15.275 --> 31:17.442
Who? Who's gonna
take care of it?

31:17.444 --> 31:18.410
The man in charge.

31:18.412 --> 31:20.212
That's you, man!

31:20.214 --> 31:21.547
You're the fuckin'
man in charge.

31:21.549 --> 31:23.215
It's you.

31:23.217 --> 31:24.983
But I'm not God, man.

31:24.985 --> 31:26.652
You understand?

31:26.654 --> 31:28.487
We'll do something,
I promise.

31:28.489 --> 31:30.088
- You'll do something...
- Yes.

31:30.090 --> 31:32.190
Listen, I love you like a
son, do you understand that?

31:32.192 --> 31:34.426
Hey, hey,
I'll do anything.

31:34.428 --> 31:37.095
I'll volunteer,
I'll work for free.

31:37.097 --> 31:39.532
I'll work for free.
I'll... I can work for you.

31:39.534 --> 31:42.234
How 'bout...
How 'bout this?

31:42.236 --> 31:45.638
How 'bout a volunteer
drug task force?

31:45.640 --> 31:47.105
- Yes...
- Yes?

31:47.107 --> 31:48.508
- Yes.
- How's that?

31:48.510 --> 31:50.643
- Yes, yes, yes, let's do that.
- Yes? Okay.

31:50.645 --> 31:52.077
- Let's do that.
- All right?

31:52.079 --> 31:53.378
- Yes.
- We'll talk about it tomorrow?

31:53.380 --> 31:55.414
- No! No. No...
- Listen...

31:55.416 --> 31:57.282
Fuckin' promise me.

31:57.284 --> 31:59.017
- I promise.
- You promise me?

31:59.019 --> 32:01.219
- I swear. I swear.
- Fuckin' promise.

32:01.221 --> 32:03.388
I won't let you down.
okay?

32:03.390 --> 32:05.290
I know what you lost.

32:05.292 --> 32:06.291
You don't know, man.

32:06.293 --> 32:08.226
Yeah, I do.

32:08.228 --> 32:10.596
No,
you don't fuckin' know, man.

32:10.598 --> 32:13.064
I do know.

32:13.066 --> 32:14.399
Come on, I... I gotta
get you home, man.

32:14.401 --> 32:16.168
You're killin' me.

32:16.170 --> 32:17.737
All right, but hey,
you promised me, you promised me.

32:17.739 --> 32:20.105
I fuckin' swear.

32:20.107 --> 32:21.707
- Okay.
- Come on.

32:21.709 --> 32:23.643
Now, let's get up.
You're sitting in the damn mud.

32:25.112 --> 32:26.648
Hold on...

32:31.452 --> 32:33.418
Mm-mm-mm!

32:33.420 --> 32:35.755
Nothin' like the smell of death
on a Sunday mornin'.

32:35.757 --> 32:39.291
Atonement comes Sunday.

32:39.293 --> 32:41.761
What are you
talkin' about, old man?

32:41.763 --> 32:44.664
Death... comes...

32:44.666 --> 32:46.400
...redemption.

32:50.437 --> 32:54.306
Oh, shit.
What time is it?

32:54.308 --> 32:56.475
It's, uh, 7:30.

32:56.477 --> 32:58.644
7:30?

32:58.646 --> 32:59.745
Shit.

32:59.747 --> 33:02.550
I gotta go home.
I got mass at 9:00.

33:04.218 --> 33:07.085
Presbyterians
go at 10:30.

33:07.087 --> 33:08.453
Yeah, well, today,
I'm Protestant.

33:11.191 --> 33:15.561
I gotta... I gotta
talk to Reverend John.

33:15.563 --> 33:16.631
About what?

33:21.368 --> 33:22.737
Righteous anger.

33:25.138 --> 33:28.373
The blood of Christ
shed for you.

33:40.487 --> 33:42.022
Thanks.

33:45.827 --> 33:46.859
I always
like to get clean

33:46.861 --> 33:48.761
after a bender, too.

33:48.763 --> 33:51.229
The body of Christ.

33:51.231 --> 33:53.298
Broken for you.

33:53.300 --> 33:55.601
I feel like
my body's broken.

33:55.603 --> 33:59.304
If anyone has a sin
they haven't repented,

33:59.306 --> 34:01.339
or trespassed
against their brother,

34:01.341 --> 34:03.475
before taking
this bread or wine,

34:03.477 --> 34:06.444
now is the time to go
make it right with the Lord.

34:06.446 --> 34:09.049
All those who call on
Jesus Christ as his savior...

34:11.385 --> 34:13.120
...partake
in the Lord's supper.

34:15.557 --> 34:16.758
The body of Christ.

34:17.659 --> 34:19.159
Body of Christ.

34:20.460 --> 34:23.328
The body of Christ.

34:23.330 --> 34:26.099
What if we...
can't make it right?

34:27.134 --> 34:28.534
What do you mean?

34:28.536 --> 34:30.536
What if...

34:30.538 --> 34:32.203
to make it right,

34:32.205 --> 34:34.574
we have to sin?

34:34.576 --> 34:36.341
I never heard of a sin

34:36.343 --> 34:38.410
making it right.

34:38.412 --> 34:41.346
Somebody's gotta
do something

34:41.348 --> 34:43.849
about these drug dealers
killing our babies.

34:43.851 --> 34:45.818
Edward... can we have
this conversation

34:45.820 --> 34:47.787
after the service?

34:47.789 --> 34:51.757
But if one knows they ought
to do good, and they don't,

34:51.759 --> 34:53.693
isn't that a sin?

34:53.695 --> 34:56.562
Hazel, I'm not saying
do nothing, but...

34:56.564 --> 34:58.898
what Edward is saying is
something completely different.

34:58.900 --> 35:01.767
Reverend John,
what I'm saying...

35:01.769 --> 35:05.840
is actually stopping
the spread of evil.

35:11.879 --> 35:14.880
Hey, I know
how you feel.

35:14.882 --> 35:16.515
I talked to Jerry
last night, I...

35:16.517 --> 35:17.650
I think I know
what we can do.

35:17.652 --> 35:18.918
The body of Christ.

35:18.920 --> 35:20.920
I'll be back for supper.

35:20.922 --> 35:23.723
Body of Christ.

35:23.725 --> 35:25.357
- Hey, could you watch him?
- Body of Christ.

35:25.359 --> 35:27.225
Just for like an hour.

35:27.227 --> 35:29.227
- Uh, fine.
- Please. Thank you.

35:29.229 --> 35:30.261
Hi.

35:30.263 --> 35:31.496
See ya, buddy.

35:31.498 --> 35:32.900
I'm just...
Thank you.

35:34.368 --> 35:36.936
Lord have mercy.

35:39.807 --> 35:41.274
Lieutenant!

35:43.443 --> 35:44.378
Jerry!

35:47.314 --> 35:48.448
Whew.

35:51.619 --> 35:53.418
What in tarnation's
going on here?

35:53.420 --> 35:55.921
- Oh, my...
- Hey, that thing we talked about last night?

35:55.923 --> 35:58.256
Volunteer drug
task force?

35:58.258 --> 36:00.626
How'd you know
I was here?

36:00.628 --> 36:02.327
I knew your wife wouldn't
let you sleep it off at home.

36:03.430 --> 36:04.997
I do know that today's
my day of rest.

36:04.999 --> 36:06.832
- Enough rest.
- You promised, Jerry.

36:06.834 --> 36:08.901
One way or another,
somethin's gotta happen.

36:08.903 --> 36:11.537
Okay, okay,
holy shit!

36:11.539 --> 36:13.005
What do you
want me to do?

36:13.007 --> 36:15.875
- Deputize us.
- What?

36:15.877 --> 36:17.877
The volunteer
drug task force, Jerry.

36:17.879 --> 36:19.879
We talked about this.
Make it official.

36:19.881 --> 36:21.847
That takes a lot
of paperwork.

36:21.849 --> 36:23.616
Hey, come
on, man, Lieutenant,

36:23.618 --> 36:26.451
why don't you stop the red tape bull?
There's lives at stake.

36:26.453 --> 36:28.754
But even if I did,
I don't have the...

36:28.756 --> 36:30.923
the power
or the resources.

36:30.925 --> 36:32.558
I mean,
they cut off funding.

36:32.560 --> 36:34.227
I'll supply
what we need.

36:36.931 --> 36:39.632
This is pretty
unorthodox.

36:39.634 --> 36:41.634
- Desperate times.
- Yeah.

36:41.636 --> 36:43.836
All right,
but even if I do

36:43.838 --> 36:45.705
deputize you as a group,

36:45.707 --> 36:48.874
you gotta stay within
the confines of the law.

36:48.876 --> 36:50.375
Y-You understand?

36:50.377 --> 36:51.977
Absolutely.

36:51.979 --> 36:53.746
Uh, yeah?

36:53.748 --> 36:54.914
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

36:54.916 --> 36:56.448
Mm-hmm.

36:56.450 --> 36:58.751
Only citizen's arrest,
okay?

36:58.753 --> 37:01.053
You catch the bad guys,
and you bring 'em to me.

37:01.055 --> 37:02.454
- You got it?
- Got it.

37:02.456 --> 37:03.789
- Yeah, got it, got it.
- Nobody gets hurt.

37:03.791 --> 37:05.356
- Nobody.
- No way.

37:05.358 --> 37:07.526
Okay, okay...

37:07.528 --> 37:08.763
Raise your right hand.

37:09.897 --> 37:12.798
Okay, by the power
vested in me,

37:12.800 --> 37:15.935
I hereby
deputize-ish you all

37:15.937 --> 37:20.906
to the first...
drug task force volunteer group

37:20.908 --> 37:24.710
to stop the flow
and distribution

37:24.712 --> 37:27.646
of heroin
in my 300 square miles.

37:27.648 --> 37:28.848
Say "aye."

37:28.850 --> 37:31.584
- Aye.
- All right, you're good.

37:31.586 --> 37:33.819
And you're good.
And you're good.

37:33.821 --> 37:35.453
- Amen.
- All right, there you go.

37:35.455 --> 37:36.689
Where you going?

37:36.691 --> 37:37.759
- Second breakfast!
- Oh...

37:39.060 --> 37:41.894
Okay. Uh...

37:41.896 --> 37:44.264
Don't make me
regret this.

37:49.537 --> 37:52.437
I'm gonna regret this.

37:56.744 --> 37:59.377
So there's a lot of
dealers that we know about,

37:59.379 --> 38:01.113
but there's probably
more that we don't.

38:01.115 --> 38:02.548
They everywhere.

38:02.550 --> 38:03.816
But it ain't
just street drugs.

38:03.818 --> 38:05.985
I mean, I know
a lot of easy doctors

38:05.987 --> 38:08.721
that are prescribing
all kind of opioids.

38:08.723 --> 38:12.091
Morphine and codeine,
OxyContin... you name it.

38:12.093 --> 38:14.461
That's how my sister
got hooked again.

38:15.897 --> 38:17.596
Every year
I worked in the hospital,

38:17.598 --> 38:20.431
the prescriptions just
kept increasing and increasing.

38:20.433 --> 38:22.433
And there's the damn
synthetic, fentanyl.

38:22.435 --> 38:24.003
On the streets,
that's the cheap high.

38:24.005 --> 38:26.972
Mm. Okay, so...

38:26.974 --> 38:29.642
We'll go to
the local pharmacy...

38:29.644 --> 38:33.346
Oh! And this is something
that we should all carry.

38:34.715 --> 38:36.949
Cops carry this,
and we should, too.

38:36.951 --> 38:38.416
Naloxone.

38:38.418 --> 38:39.885
And when somebody's
overdosing,

38:39.887 --> 38:41.954
it saves their life.

38:41.956 --> 38:43.856
It encourages
the addicts

38:43.858 --> 38:45.423
to keep doing drugs...
come on.

38:45.425 --> 38:47.860
No, it saves lives,
period.

38:47.862 --> 38:50.129
If people are dying,
we gotta help them.

38:50.131 --> 38:52.531
I thought that, you know,
this is why we're doing it...

38:52.533 --> 38:54.101
to save lives.

38:55.903 --> 38:57.570
Mm. Where do we start?

38:57.572 --> 39:00.005
The highway.

39:00.007 --> 39:01.707
That's where
it's coming from.

39:01.709 --> 39:03.843
I'll monitor
the interstate exits,

39:03.845 --> 39:05.845
and I'll do car checks...
all right?

39:05.847 --> 39:08.180
Well, I can paint
warning signs.

39:08.182 --> 39:09.515
You know,
so all the cars see it

39:09.517 --> 39:10.916
when they're
coming into town.

39:10.918 --> 39:14.620
I'll monitor the woods.
Foot traffic, bikes...

39:14.622 --> 39:18.489
Great. Okay, so...
we'll do all that.

39:18.491 --> 39:20.693
What's next
on our priority list?

39:20.695 --> 39:22.027
Heh, or the hit list.

39:23.631 --> 39:25.463
Who's most likely
to OD?

39:25.465 --> 39:27.132
- Well, at the school.
- Right.

39:27.134 --> 39:29.501
Okay, I'll call them
in the morning.

39:29.503 --> 39:30.936
I mean, we definitely
have the sympathy

39:30.938 --> 39:32.605
of the principal
and the parents.

39:32.607 --> 39:34.607
I'll check
the kids' backpacks.

39:34.609 --> 39:36.942
And I'll set the, um,
metal detector

39:36.944 --> 39:39.945
so we do school checks
every day.

39:39.947 --> 39:41.180
That's great,
but at some point

39:41.182 --> 39:44.016
we have to go
to the dealers' houses.

39:44.018 --> 39:47.586
- And do what?
- Stop them.

39:47.588 --> 39:50.556
How?

39:50.558 --> 39:53.460
By any means necessary.

39:54.862 --> 39:57.462
What does that mean?

39:57.464 --> 40:00.532
No, no, no, no, no.
Look... uh, okay, wh...

40:00.534 --> 40:01.967
By the grace of God,

40:01.969 --> 40:04.572
the demand will just
dry up by then.

40:07.708 --> 40:09.808
Yeah.
When do we start?

40:10.945 --> 40:12.613
Sunrise.

40:19.687 --> 40:22.521
I hope you know
I'd do anything for you.

40:22.523 --> 40:24.723
All right, come on.
Ohh... all right.

40:24.725 --> 40:26.694
Night, night, buddy.

40:55.289 --> 40:56.555
I gotta
check your car

40:56.557 --> 40:58.724
before I let you
into our town.

40:58.726 --> 41:00.059
Who are you with?

41:00.061 --> 41:02.194
Waste and sanitation.

41:02.196 --> 41:03.698
What?

41:07.034 --> 41:09.034
I'm cleanin' up shit.

41:09.036 --> 41:11.005
Open the trunk.

41:21.048 --> 41:22.183
Hey!

41:30.925 --> 41:31.959
Hey!

41:33.127 --> 41:34.595
Stop!

41:39.033 --> 41:40.701
Fuck you, man!

41:42.937 --> 41:44.839
Fuckin' pull over!

41:47.875 --> 41:49.708
- Stop!
- What the fuck, man?

41:49.710 --> 41:51.744
- Turn it off!
- Get the fuck outta my way!

41:51.746 --> 41:53.547
Turn it the fuck off.

41:58.886 --> 42:00.187
Get off.

42:02.156 --> 42:04.058
Empty the bag.

42:19.206 --> 42:21.240
Get on your fuckin' knees.

42:21.242 --> 42:22.841
Get on
your fuckin' knees!

42:22.843 --> 42:26.812
Hey, man...
it's just some dope.

42:31.619 --> 42:33.285
Listen to me.

42:33.287 --> 42:36.855
If I ever...
see you again...

42:36.857 --> 42:38.390
I will
fuckin' kill you.

42:38.392 --> 42:40.125
You understand?

42:40.127 --> 42:41.962
You're fuckin' crazy!

42:43.697 --> 42:45.664
That's right.

42:45.666 --> 42:47.268
Tell your
fuckin' friends.

42:51.105 --> 42:52.606
Get the fuck outta here.

42:57.211 --> 42:58.844
Leave that shit.
Leave it!

42:58.846 --> 42:59.713
Get the fuck outta here.

43:28.809 --> 43:30.744
Hey! What does that mean?

43:32.980 --> 43:36.014
Well... I think
it's pretty obvious.

43:36.016 --> 43:37.449
Not to me.

43:37.451 --> 43:39.151
You hittin' the bottle?

43:40.788 --> 43:43.889
It means, "Do not bring drugs
into our town."

43:43.891 --> 43:45.357
You're nuts.

43:45.359 --> 43:46.727
What's your name?

43:47.962 --> 43:51.029
Huh? Get back here,
you little bitch.

43:51.031 --> 43:54.034
I will put your license
to the sheriff's station!

44:01.041 --> 44:02.076
Ohh!

44:07.381 --> 44:09.948
What the hell?

44:09.950 --> 44:12.818
Oh, Lord & Taylor.
Okay, fine.

44:12.820 --> 44:15.053
Fine, fine, fine.

44:16.190 --> 44:18.056
"Don't...

44:18.058 --> 44:19.660
"bring..."

44:21.462 --> 44:23.063
"...drugs..."

44:27.468 --> 44:29.434
Hey, I got my other
hunting buddies.

44:29.436 --> 44:31.837
They're out there,
checking the other roads for car checks.

44:31.839 --> 44:33.105
Better?

44:33.107 --> 44:34.773
Yeah.

44:34.775 --> 44:36.842
Ugh, I'm gonna
need some moms

44:36.844 --> 44:38.310
to help me
paint more signs.

44:38.312 --> 44:40.513
Uh, more, uh...
more direct signs.

44:40.515 --> 44:43.282
- Yes, more direct signs.
- Okay.

44:43.284 --> 44:45.450
Hey, uh,
you're telling me

44:45.452 --> 44:47.352
that you have
a pain in your leg

44:47.354 --> 44:49.021
that's not
getting any better?

44:49.023 --> 44:51.156
I have
for a while now, yeah.

44:51.158 --> 44:53.861
Okay. Thank you.

45:00.401 --> 45:02.768
Oh, hi.
Can I help you?

45:02.770 --> 45:03.904
What's your pain level?

45:05.540 --> 45:07.339
Like 7 1/2.

45:07.341 --> 45:08.941
Hmm...

45:08.943 --> 45:10.375
Okay, well, I think
I have something here

45:10.377 --> 45:12.811
that is going to
help out quite a bit.

45:12.813 --> 45:13.747
Oh, yeah?

45:16.483 --> 45:18.518
Uh... fill
this prescription?

45:18.520 --> 45:20.020
Oh, sure thing.

45:20.522 --> 45:22.454
Oxycodone.

45:22.456 --> 45:24.990
Yes, sir, that's gonna make
you feel right as rain.

45:24.992 --> 45:26.158
How often?

45:26.160 --> 45:27.926
Well, the bottle
says,

45:27.928 --> 45:30.262
"As needed
or every four hours,"

45:30.264 --> 45:32.965
but, you know.

45:32.967 --> 45:34.333
I know what?

45:34.335 --> 45:36.802
Take it as often
as needed.

45:36.804 --> 45:38.103
That's up to you.

45:38.105 --> 45:39.838
There's no way
she'll fill that all.

45:39.840 --> 45:41.006
Just watch.

45:47.881 --> 45:49.314
How will you be paying?

45:49.316 --> 45:51.283
Oh, for Pete's sake,
you've gotta be kidding me.

45:51.285 --> 45:52.552
What?

45:52.554 --> 45:54.386
Uh, well, listen, I'm...

45:54.388 --> 45:56.221
I'm gonna have to come back
for more, this is...

45:56.223 --> 45:58.423
Well, you can make
another appointment.

45:58.425 --> 46:00.125
This isn't enough.
Like, I'm here now.

46:00.127 --> 46:01.960
Could you just
write me another one?

46:01.962 --> 46:04.296
Did you even look before
you grabbed all those drugs?

46:04.298 --> 46:06.031
Of course.

46:06.033 --> 46:07.600
Why on earth would
we need all that dope?

46:07.602 --> 46:09.434
I mean, I...

46:09.436 --> 46:11.270
Did you even
go to school?

46:11.272 --> 46:13.105
Ma'am, you're gonna
have to calm down.

46:13.107 --> 46:15.040
I'm only doing my job.

46:15.042 --> 46:18.477
I... I do have
other patients, but...

46:18.479 --> 46:20.114
There you go.

46:22.617 --> 46:25.217
Thanks.
So this is it?

46:25.219 --> 46:27.452
You just...

46:27.454 --> 46:28.487
- This is pr...
- ...fuckin'...

46:28.489 --> 46:29.955
This is procedure.

46:29.957 --> 46:31.056
It's procedure.

46:31.058 --> 46:33.626
It's an obscene
amount of drugs.

46:33.628 --> 46:35.894
Don't you think
I know that?

46:35.896 --> 46:38.531
And you just
fill it anyway?

46:38.533 --> 46:39.998
It's just another day.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.602
- Ohh!
- No, it's not.

46:42.604 --> 46:44.936
Just let us know
if anybody else

46:44.938 --> 46:46.204
is filling prescriptions
like this.

46:46.206 --> 46:48.940
Sir, I can't do that
because of the HIPAA law.

46:48.942 --> 46:51.209
No, you better,
or God help you.

46:51.211 --> 46:53.579
Yeah, you just hand
these things out, right?

46:53.581 --> 46:55.080
I come in and say
my foot hurts...

46:55.082 --> 46:56.448
Everything that I've done
is perfectly legal.

46:56.450 --> 46:58.417
It's perfectly legal.
That's good.

46:58.419 --> 46:59.151
You're gonna
have to leave,

46:59.153 --> 47:00.352
or I'll have to call
the police.

47:00.354 --> 47:02.387
So, call 'em!

47:02.389 --> 47:06.391
Do you know that
there are kids dying?

47:06.393 --> 47:09.027
I lost both of my sons.
They're gone.

47:09.029 --> 47:10.262
- Oh, it's you.
- Yeah, well,

47:10.264 --> 47:12.030
I'm not the only one
suffering in this town.

47:12.032 --> 47:13.467
Not by a longshot.

47:15.235 --> 47:18.303
It's the system, ma'am.
I... I have to do my job.

47:18.305 --> 47:19.971
That's fuckin' great.

47:19.973 --> 47:22.274
If you ever
over-prescribe again,

47:22.276 --> 47:24.478
you'll never write
another fuckin' prescription.

47:25.680 --> 47:27.680
You hear
what I'm sayin'?

47:27.682 --> 47:29.383
Good.

47:30.585 --> 47:32.117
<i>Shame on you.</i>

47:32.119 --> 47:35.387
Just give us the name
of the doctor...

47:35.389 --> 47:36.689
if this happens again.

47:41.362 --> 47:44.396
Here. Just write down
your number.

47:52.574 --> 47:54.308
Keep your drugs.

47:58.078 --> 48:00.245
<i>A new report
coming out today</i>

48:00.247 --> 48:02.214
<i>about the opioid epidemic.</i>

48:02.216 --> 48:05.117
<i>Recently, the state of Nebraska
approved fentanyl</i>

48:05.119 --> 48:07.052
<i>to be used in lethal injections.</i>

48:07.054 --> 48:09.221
<i>As of right now,
many other states</i>

48:09.223 --> 48:10.723
<i>are considering
doing the same.</i>

48:10.725 --> 48:13.726
<i>Many of the street drugs
are laced with fentanyl,</i>

48:13.728 --> 48:15.961
<i>adding to the rising
overdose rate. Opioids...</i>

48:15.963 --> 48:18.196
Whatcha need, boss?

48:18.198 --> 48:21.199
<i>...if misused,
the consequences can be deadly.</i>

48:23.137 --> 48:26.006
So, Adam, how's it goin'?

48:27.474 --> 48:29.107
What?

48:29.109 --> 48:30.710
- Aw, you didn't hear.
- Mm.

48:30.712 --> 48:33.245
Well, our Adam here,
he's been putting together

48:33.247 --> 48:36.549
a renegade group of locals
to fight the drugs in our town.

48:36.551 --> 48:39.217
Wow. That's pretty
awesome, actually.

48:39.219 --> 48:40.653
Yeah, isn't it?

48:40.655 --> 48:43.288
That's what all the shit down
by the interstate was about.

48:43.290 --> 48:46.258
So, Adam...
how's it goin'?

48:46.260 --> 48:48.293
Too soon to tell.

48:48.295 --> 48:50.128
- I wanna help.
- Yeah.

48:50.130 --> 48:53.398
I wanna help.
My sister, she passed last Christmas.

48:53.400 --> 48:55.267
Know that?

48:55.269 --> 48:57.337
No, I didn't know that.
I'm sorry.

49:00.608 --> 49:02.374
That's not
the worst of it.

49:02.376 --> 49:04.510
She was in treatment.

49:04.512 --> 49:06.746
She was doing good.
On a good path.

49:06.748 --> 49:10.783
And then she got kidney trouble,
went back to the hospital.

49:10.785 --> 49:13.553
And the pills.

49:13.555 --> 49:15.287
Nope,
didn't have to.

49:15.289 --> 49:16.689
No, her dealer
snuck in there

49:16.691 --> 49:18.457
while we were out of the room
and gave her the drugs.

49:18.459 --> 49:20.192
And her system
couldn't handle it.

49:20.194 --> 49:22.662
- He snuck in?
- Yeah.

49:22.664 --> 49:24.797
- That's fuckin' crazy.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

49:24.799 --> 49:27.500
Yeah. He went away for a
couple months and got out.

49:27.502 --> 49:30.035
- If I ever found him...
- I'd kill him.

49:30.037 --> 49:31.336
I'd kill all of 'em.

49:31.338 --> 49:33.405
I understand
how you feel, trust me.

49:33.407 --> 49:36.441
But we're trying
to do this the right way.

49:36.443 --> 49:38.109
Oh, you're trying to
do this the right way?

49:38.111 --> 49:39.478
We're tryin', yeah.

49:39.480 --> 49:42.047
The right way, huh?
Okay, well,

49:42.049 --> 49:43.381
when you're done
scannin' backpacks

49:43.383 --> 49:45.383
and holdin' signs
under the interstate,

49:45.385 --> 49:47.352
you let me know.

49:50.324 --> 49:52.292
- You done?
- Yeah, I'm done.

50:10.512 --> 50:12.545
Okay...

50:12.547 --> 50:15.080
<i>So obviously,
some of my talks</i>

50:15.082 --> 50:16.751
didn't drive my point home.

50:19.119 --> 50:22.788
Some of you still don't
care enough...

50:22.790 --> 50:27.192
about your families...

50:27.194 --> 50:29.494
your friends...

50:29.496 --> 50:32.397
and, sadly, yourselves.

50:32.399 --> 50:35.469
But I have brought backup.

50:37.204 --> 50:39.572
All of these mothers
that you see,

50:39.574 --> 50:42.675
all of them...

50:42.677 --> 50:45.110
they have been affected

50:45.112 --> 50:47.547
by the heroin epidemic.

50:47.549 --> 50:50.315
And they have
come here today...

50:50.317 --> 50:52.484
to help us
make this mission

50:52.486 --> 50:54.386
crystal clear.

50:54.388 --> 50:57.790
I've talked to the principal,
and he agrees.

50:59.192 --> 51:02.628
<i>If anyone
is found talking...</i>

51:02.630 --> 51:03.696
You're good.

51:03.698 --> 51:04.897
<i>...dealing...</i>

51:04.899 --> 51:08.501
<i>even thinking
about doing drugs,</i>

51:08.503 --> 51:10.536
<i>you are going
to be escorted...</i>

51:10.538 --> 51:13.471
- Oh, hell no.
- ...by one of our <i>volunteer moms...</i>

51:13.473 --> 51:17.643
and by your parents
to the police station.

51:17.645 --> 51:19.912
<i>There, you will
be fingerprinted.</i>

51:19.914 --> 51:21.547
<i>You'll be photographed,</i>

51:21.549 --> 51:23.716
<i>and you'll be
suspended from school.</i>

51:26.253 --> 51:27.252
What's up?

51:28.656 --> 51:31.757
It's going
to ruin your lives.

51:31.759 --> 51:35.193
We've all had children
that are dead.

51:36.931 --> 51:39.299
- Adam!
- Stop!

51:41.769 --> 51:43.703
But your mom
and your families...

51:47.374 --> 51:49.809
Stop!

51:49.811 --> 51:52.310
<i>Just reach out,
before it's too late.</i>

51:53.781 --> 51:56.249
Hey! Hey!

51:58.720 --> 52:00.588
- Get out!
- Stop!

52:01.723 --> 52:03.858
Where is it?
Where is it?

52:06.326 --> 52:07.526
I said where is it?

52:07.528 --> 52:08.761
- Get off!
- I know you've got it!

52:08.763 --> 52:11.329
Hey, hey!
Adam! Stop!

52:11.331 --> 52:13.666
What the hell's
wrong with you?

52:13.668 --> 52:15.901
Stop it!
On school grounds, really?

52:15.903 --> 52:17.870
Chill!

52:17.872 --> 52:19.805
What the hell is wrong
with you, son?

52:19.807 --> 52:22.407
Listen to me.

52:22.409 --> 52:24.275
I'm gonna have
to take you in.

52:24.277 --> 52:26.344
Put your hands
behind your back.

52:26.346 --> 52:28.648
You're under arrest.

52:28.650 --> 52:32.484
<i>And we will
fight for you.</i>

52:32.486 --> 52:33.653
We're here for you.

52:33.655 --> 52:35.455
We love you!

52:37.992 --> 52:39.761
Come on.

52:45.600 --> 52:47.332
I don't understand
what the big deal is.

52:47.334 --> 52:48.636
I barely touched him.
The kid'll be fine.

52:51.539 --> 52:53.440
You're lucky
his parents aren't wealthy.

52:56.410 --> 52:58.511
Do you even realize
what you've done?

52:58.513 --> 52:59.845
Yeah. Your fuckin' job.

52:59.847 --> 53:01.246
Oh, bullshit.

53:01.248 --> 53:02.617
This is about revenge.

53:04.652 --> 53:05.618
What are you talking about?

53:05.620 --> 53:07.452
Kenny.

53:07.454 --> 53:08.623
Kenny?

53:09.256 --> 53:10.890
Your sister Cheyenne's
friend Kenny.

53:10.892 --> 53:12.290
What?

53:12.292 --> 53:14.294
The one she was
in the marching band with.

53:15.328 --> 53:16.796
No. Fat Kenny?

53:16.798 --> 53:19.431
He called 911
when your sister overdosed.

53:19.433 --> 53:20.800
That was fat fucking Kenny?

53:20.802 --> 53:21.934
Fat Kenny.
That's right.

53:21.936 --> 53:23.736
You fucking kidding me?

53:23.738 --> 53:25.705
Listen to me.
Okay?

53:25.707 --> 53:27.006
We have warrants
on him...

53:27.008 --> 53:29.307
Oh, good.
Good work.

53:29.309 --> 53:30.710
A couple of break-ins
and robberies.

53:30.712 --> 53:32.812
The guy is armed
and dangerous.

53:32.814 --> 53:34.446
- I'm gonna fucking kill him.
- No, you're not gonna do that.

53:34.448 --> 53:35.981
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

53:35.983 --> 53:37.983
Get these fucking cuffs off me
and I'll fucking kill him!

53:37.985 --> 53:39.252
Shut it!

53:40.353 --> 53:42.021
Shut it.

53:42.023 --> 53:43.756
You listen here,
okay?

53:43.758 --> 53:45.825
You better name
your next son Edward,

53:45.827 --> 53:49.329
'cause that guy stopped you
from pummelin' that kid.

53:51.364 --> 53:52.698
- Jerry...
- What?

53:52.700 --> 53:54.600
Why didn't you
fuckin' tell me?

53:54.602 --> 53:56.502
What difference
does it make?

53:56.504 --> 53:58.806
Kill some lowlife
to honor your sister's death?

54:00.407 --> 54:01.774
It's somethin'.

54:01.776 --> 54:04.009
Are you gonna
leave your infant son,

54:04.011 --> 54:05.680
like your daddy
left you?

54:06.480 --> 54:07.445
It's different.

54:07.447 --> 54:08.748
It's nothing.

54:08.750 --> 54:10.950
And you're
better than that.

54:14.387 --> 54:15.857
What's happening?

54:18.693 --> 54:20.325
What, uh...

54:20.327 --> 54:21.827
What'd you go
and charge on him?

54:21.829 --> 54:23.629
Nothin' yet.

54:23.631 --> 54:24.832
But we're
gonna discuss it.

54:32.405 --> 54:34.540
I'm disbanding
this task force.

54:34.542 --> 54:36.575
Oh, man, no!

54:36.577 --> 54:38.911
Listen, if you want to join
the police academy,

54:38.913 --> 54:41.479
be my guest...
this is over.

54:41.481 --> 54:43.414
Oh, but we're doing
so much good.

54:43.416 --> 54:45.651
And you're this close
to doing so much bad.

54:45.653 --> 54:48.521
This is bull...
Fuck.

54:48.523 --> 54:52.390
And you...
you're no longer my responsibility.

54:52.392 --> 54:53.828
Your mother's
on her way.

54:56.964 --> 54:59.567
Yeah. I need a smoke.

55:02.369 --> 55:03.704
That's right.

55:08.142 --> 55:11.110
Come on, Jerry.

55:11.112 --> 55:12.912
Come on...

55:12.914 --> 55:16.749
My name...
is Lieutenant Jerald Whalen.

55:16.751 --> 55:17.917
And this is over.

55:17.919 --> 55:20.119
Someone needs
to save these kids.

55:20.121 --> 55:23.122
Listen, I have police
business to attend to.

55:23.124 --> 55:25.124
And I have to clean up
this mess.

55:25.126 --> 55:27.793
I'd appreciate it if you'd
vacate the office, please.

55:27.795 --> 55:29.764
- But if...
- Go! Now.

55:31.032 --> 55:31.933
God damn it.

55:40.407 --> 55:42.775
Okay, well,
you know... great.

55:42.777 --> 55:44.643
Now what?

55:44.645 --> 55:45.978
Now nothin',
it's over.

55:45.980 --> 55:47.680
What do you mean
it's over, man?

55:47.682 --> 55:50.481
The dealers are out there
still, in plain damn sight!

55:50.483 --> 55:51.917
Yeah, well...

55:51.919 --> 55:55.120
I'm likely gettin' charged
or fuckin' arrested, so...

55:55.122 --> 55:57.122
Not before
I find Kenny.

55:57.124 --> 55:58.924
- What the heck are you talking about?
- Look, you heard Jerry.

55:58.926 --> 56:01.794
All right? We're done.
Disbanded. All right?

56:01.796 --> 56:03.562
And, honestly,
like what the fu...

56:03.564 --> 56:05.798
We gotta grow up.
We... This is a nat...

56:05.800 --> 56:07.566
It's a national epidemic.
Did we actually think

56:07.568 --> 56:08.567
we were gonna
make a difference?

56:08.569 --> 56:10.502
No, we did
make a difference.

56:10.504 --> 56:12.638
Think of the kids
this week, come on.

56:12.640 --> 56:13.973
And what about
the kids next week?

56:13.975 --> 56:15.207
And the week
after that?

56:15.209 --> 56:17.176
Nothing fucking changes.

56:17.178 --> 56:18.544
Nothin' new
under the sun.

56:18.546 --> 56:19.812
Exactly.

56:19.814 --> 56:21.782
Just like the father,
just like the son.

56:23.184 --> 56:24.884
What the fuck
did you just say?

56:26.754 --> 56:28.921
I said your father
was a coward.

56:28.923 --> 56:30.856
Like you.

56:30.858 --> 56:33.559
Oh, come on.

56:35.162 --> 56:36.931
Hey, I'm disappointed
in you, man.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.867
I knew your father was
a punk-ass behind the bars,

56:41.869 --> 56:43.903
I just didn't know you were gonna
turn out to be the same way.

56:43.905 --> 56:45.170
Take that shit back.
You don't fuckin' know!

56:45.172 --> 56:46.872
Man, you don't put
your hands on me!

56:46.874 --> 56:48.574
- Yeah, come on!
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

56:48.576 --> 56:51.710
Stop it! Stop it
right now, you two!

56:51.712 --> 56:53.712
Edward...
Edward, please.

56:53.714 --> 56:55.814
- Just go to your truck.
- Ah, yeah!

56:55.816 --> 56:58.017
Gonna fuckin'
walk away?

56:58.019 --> 57:00.653
Not a word
from you.

57:00.655 --> 57:02.888
Man up!

57:02.890 --> 57:04.857
Look, I-I don't know
your mom that well,

57:04.859 --> 57:07.026
but I-I heard that she's
a real piece of work.

57:07.028 --> 57:08.260
- My mom's a fuckin' bitch.
- No, none of that. No.

57:08.262 --> 57:10.262
This is your mother.

57:10.264 --> 57:12.631
Okay, go to her.
Please?

57:12.633 --> 57:14.033
Before you
ruin your life.

57:14.035 --> 57:16.235
Don't make her lose
another child, Adam.

57:16.237 --> 57:18.137
- She doesn't care.
- Oh, no.

57:18.139 --> 57:19.939
A lot of people just
don't have the ability

57:19.941 --> 57:22.174
to say how they care...
she's hurting.

57:22.176 --> 57:24.276
Honey, she's hurting
just like you.

57:24.278 --> 57:26.178
- Yeah.
- And she is suffering

57:26.180 --> 57:27.949
just as much
as you are.

57:30.751 --> 57:32.217
I gotta... I gotta...
I gotta find Kenny.

57:32.219 --> 57:33.953
Listen to me, please?

57:33.955 --> 57:35.220
Please?

57:35.222 --> 57:37.189
- Adam!
- What?

57:37.191 --> 57:40.592
If you let this hate
into your heart,

57:40.594 --> 57:43.595
it will consume you.

57:43.597 --> 57:44.799
Here.

57:46.767 --> 57:48.934
May God bless you,

57:48.936 --> 57:50.871
and keep you.

57:53.607 --> 57:55.242
From yourself.

57:57.311 --> 58:00.079
It's too late for that.

58:00.081 --> 58:01.248
No...

58:16.664 --> 58:19.198
Make your mama proud,
don't ya?

58:19.200 --> 58:20.801
Shut up.

58:21.335 --> 58:24.169
Well, I'm responsible
for you now.

58:24.171 --> 58:26.905
Just like when
you was in diapers.

58:26.907 --> 58:29.641
- So get in.
- I'm not gettin' in.

58:29.643 --> 58:31.243
Get in.

58:31.245 --> 58:32.911
Don't make me call
the staties.

58:32.913 --> 58:34.148
Get in.

58:42.857 --> 58:44.189
Not a fuckin' word.

58:44.191 --> 58:45.891
Not a fuckin' word?

58:49.930 --> 58:51.930
You and I are gonna have
a little fuckin' chat.

58:51.932 --> 58:54.233
Okay?

58:54.235 --> 58:58.270
First off, what in God's
name were you thinking?

58:58.272 --> 59:01.240
- Nothing.
- Well, obviously.

59:01.242 --> 59:03.208
- Take me to Cheyenne.
- Oh, come on.

59:03.210 --> 59:06.178
- Take me.
- Adam, she's dead.

59:06.180 --> 59:08.881
She's six feet under.

59:08.883 --> 59:10.151
It's over!

59:13.087 --> 59:14.820
Make it quick.

59:58.099 --> 59:59.998
Come on.

1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:01.168
That's enough.

1:00:06.373 --> 1:00:08.907
You know...

1:00:08.909 --> 1:00:14.346
I, uh, I may have
chosen poorly at times.

1:00:14.348 --> 1:00:16.317
Especially
when raising you.

1:00:17.718 --> 1:00:19.818
But I'll tell you this.

1:00:19.820 --> 1:00:23.789
I will spend
my every last breath

1:00:23.791 --> 1:00:26.193
tellin' you to be
a good daddy to that boy.

1:00:28.195 --> 1:00:31.232
Do you think I didn't care
when you left me, too?

1:00:34.735 --> 1:00:36.871
I just had
to get out of here.

1:00:39.874 --> 1:00:41.907
Why?

1:00:41.909 --> 1:00:44.810
So you could throw it all away,
like your sister did?

1:00:44.812 --> 1:00:46.278
- I gotta go.
- Adam...

1:00:46.280 --> 1:00:47.414
Adam...

1:00:51.452 --> 1:00:54.153
He needs you.

1:00:54.155 --> 1:00:55.954
You fought for him.

1:00:55.956 --> 1:00:58.023
You fought for your country,
you fought overseas,

1:00:58.025 --> 1:01:00.294
you fought
for all of us.

1:01:02.196 --> 1:01:05.933
Now it's time that you
have to fight for you, son.

1:01:06.501 --> 1:01:09.968
Like that little boy's life
depends on it.

1:01:09.970 --> 1:01:11.672
You understand me?

1:01:18.078 --> 1:01:19.780
I am.

1:01:22.116 --> 1:01:23.317
Adam...

1:01:24.451 --> 1:01:25.751
Adam!

1:01:25.753 --> 1:01:27.721
Would you do something
for me?

1:01:28.255 --> 1:01:30.090
What?

1:01:32.793 --> 1:01:35.129
Don't let Phil
turn out like me.

1:01:38.533 --> 1:01:40.399
Damn it, Adam.

1:01:45.005 --> 1:01:47.339
Okay, he's gotta be
getting a shipment soon.

1:01:47.341 --> 1:01:49.107
God, maybe we've
done such great work

1:01:49.109 --> 1:01:51.178
that there's
no longer a demand, right?

1:01:54.549 --> 1:01:57.349
Ugh. Or maybe not.

1:01:57.351 --> 1:01:58.884
Okay...

1:02:00.955 --> 1:02:03.956
Hood's up.
His door is open.

1:02:03.958 --> 1:02:05.924
Oh, I just never thought
it would be like this.

1:02:05.926 --> 1:02:07.560
Oh, my God!
No, I'm not...

1:02:07.562 --> 1:02:09.061
I hate things that kill.

1:02:09.063 --> 1:02:10.164
Please...
It's for protection.

1:02:11.031 --> 1:02:12.565
He sees us.

1:02:12.567 --> 1:02:14.866
I just, I don't want
things to escalate, Edward.

1:02:14.868 --> 1:02:17.436
He's armed.
We gotta be armed.

1:02:17.438 --> 1:02:19.071
He's looking at us.

1:02:19.073 --> 1:02:20.272
Come on.

1:02:28.983 --> 1:02:30.315
Hey, heh.

1:02:37.057 --> 1:02:38.325
Just wanna talk.

1:02:42.229 --> 1:02:43.462
- Freeze!
- No, wait!

1:02:43.464 --> 1:02:45.030
Freeze!

1:02:48.002 --> 1:02:48.969
Dad!

1:02:50.404 --> 1:02:52.170
My God.

1:02:54.341 --> 1:02:56.377
Get over here.
Come on!

1:03:34.348 --> 1:03:36.183
I shouldn't have
brought my gun.

1:03:38.485 --> 1:03:39.853
What?

1:03:41.355 --> 1:03:42.921
Hazel was right.

1:03:42.923 --> 1:03:44.956
You...

1:03:44.958 --> 1:03:45.893
You did this?

1:03:47.227 --> 1:03:49.895
What did you do?

1:03:49.897 --> 1:03:52.532
What did you do?
What did you... do?!

1:03:53.434 --> 1:03:55.369
What did you do?

1:04:05.479 --> 1:04:06.847
Fuck.

1:04:12.654 --> 1:04:14.988
Why Hazel?

1:04:24.398 --> 1:04:26.133
I'm sorry.

1:04:54.194 --> 1:04:57.162
Those who walk with God,

1:04:57.164 --> 1:05:00.533
have peace
in their heart...

1:05:00.535 --> 1:05:02.637
and eternal rest forever.

1:05:09.376 --> 1:05:13.713
Our Father...
who art in Heaven...

1:05:13.715 --> 1:05:16.047
hallowed be Thy name.

1:05:16.049 --> 1:05:18.450
Thy kingdom come,

1:05:18.452 --> 1:05:19.619
Thy will be done

1:05:19.621 --> 1:05:22.154
on Earth as it is
in Heaven.

1:05:22.156 --> 1:05:24.289
Give us this day
our daily bread.

1:05:24.291 --> 1:05:27.459
Forgive us
our trespasses...

1:05:27.461 --> 1:05:30.262
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1:05:30.264 --> 1:05:32.632
And lead us not
into temptation,

1:05:32.634 --> 1:05:36.034
but deliver us from evil.

1:05:45.713 --> 1:05:47.481
Listen up!

1:05:54.589 --> 1:05:56.056
Have you had enough?

1:05:58.526 --> 1:06:00.158
Have you had enough?

1:06:00.160 --> 1:06:01.326
Yeah. Yeah.

1:06:01.328 --> 1:06:03.128
Yes.

1:06:03.130 --> 1:06:04.496
Have you had enough?

1:06:04.498 --> 1:06:05.631
Yeah!

1:06:05.633 --> 1:06:07.700
Are you ready
to do something?

1:06:07.702 --> 1:06:09.034
We're doin' the march.

1:06:09.036 --> 1:06:10.068
You're doin'
the march?

1:06:10.070 --> 1:06:12.072
- Yeah.
- Hey, we're doin' the march.

1:06:17.512 --> 1:06:19.177
We'll do our own
damn march!

1:06:21.415 --> 1:06:23.549
We will hunt
these motherfuckers down...

1:06:23.551 --> 1:06:25.217
one by one.

1:06:25.219 --> 1:06:26.519
Fuck, yeah!

1:06:26.521 --> 1:06:28.119
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!

1:06:28.121 --> 1:06:29.689
Do you give a shit?!

1:06:29.691 --> 1:06:31.557
Then we rally!

1:06:31.559 --> 1:06:33.158
Follow me!

1:06:33.160 --> 1:06:36.094
Hey! He deals, get him!

1:06:40.267 --> 1:06:41.368
Hi, you guys.

1:06:45.105 --> 1:06:47.673
I don't... I don't
have any more candles.

1:06:47.675 --> 1:06:50.610
Well, it's only
about a mile to the memorial.

1:06:50.612 --> 1:06:51.844
Everyone needs
to have a flame.

1:07:34.154 --> 1:07:35.322
Hey.

1:07:37.190 --> 1:07:38.524
Adam, you scared us.

1:07:38.526 --> 1:07:40.292
What are
you guys doing?

1:07:40.294 --> 1:07:42.227
Huntin'.
Where's Edward?

1:07:42.229 --> 1:07:43.663
He's back in town.
He's puttin' up flyers

1:07:43.665 --> 1:07:45.196
for his peace march.

1:07:45.198 --> 1:07:47.434
Why's he doin' that?
Who wants peace right now?

1:07:49.136 --> 1:07:50.235
Hey, listen, man...

1:07:50.237 --> 1:07:51.537
Don't fuckin'
touch me.

1:07:51.539 --> 1:07:52.705
We're huntin'
these guys down.

1:07:52.707 --> 1:07:54.372
The whole town's
huntin' for 'em.

1:07:54.374 --> 1:07:55.473
And his old man.

1:07:55.475 --> 1:07:57.342
Not the whole town.
What are you doin'?

1:07:57.344 --> 1:07:58.546
Waitin' on Edward.

1:07:59.781 --> 1:08:01.379
Are you in?

1:08:01.381 --> 1:08:02.548
Yeah, I'm in.

1:08:02.550 --> 1:08:04.482
You?

1:08:04.484 --> 1:08:07.218
No, I'm not
fucking in.

1:08:07.220 --> 1:08:08.856
You really think this
is what Hazel would want?

1:08:10.558 --> 1:08:11.693
I think Hazel's dead.

1:08:13.293 --> 1:08:16.161
That's what I think.

1:08:16.163 --> 1:08:17.297
Let's go.

1:08:21.703 --> 1:08:23.201
Let's go!

1:08:47.895 --> 1:08:51.597
- Adam! Adam!
- Whoo!

1:08:51.599 --> 1:08:54.232
This is fucking crazy, man!
You need to call this off.

1:08:54.234 --> 1:08:55.835
It's the only way,
Johnny!

1:08:57.404 --> 1:08:59.204
Look at this shit, Adam!
You started it!

1:08:59.206 --> 1:09:01.339
You got to put
a fucking end to it!

1:09:01.341 --> 1:09:02.708
âª ...the light âª

1:09:02.710 --> 1:09:05.645
âª No more darkness âª

1:09:05.647 --> 1:09:08.547
âª No more night âª

1:09:14.956 --> 1:09:17.355
Someone's getting killed here,
guys, I'm outta this!

1:09:17.357 --> 1:09:18.356
Fuck this!

1:09:18.358 --> 1:09:20.425
Johnny, you chickenshit!

1:09:20.427 --> 1:09:21.361
Let him go!

1:09:26.601 --> 1:09:29.835
âª No sorrow
in sight âª

1:09:29.837 --> 1:09:35.473
âª Praise the Lord,
I saw the light âª

1:09:35.475 --> 1:09:41.246
âª I saw the light,
I saw the light âª

1:09:41.248 --> 1:09:44.315
âª No more darkness âª

1:09:44.317 --> 1:09:46.384
âª No more night âª

1:09:56.664 --> 1:09:57.930
<i>Kenny!</i>

1:09:57.932 --> 1:09:59.632
<i>I know you can
hear me!</i>

1:09:59.634 --> 1:10:02.670
Come out, now,
and show your face!

1:10:23.290 --> 1:10:25.958
âª I saw the light âª

1:10:25.960 --> 1:10:28.928
âª I saw the light âª

1:10:28.930 --> 1:10:31.664
âª I saw the light âª

1:10:31.666 --> 1:10:33.999
âª No more darkness âª

1:10:34.001 --> 1:10:36.470
âª No more night... âª

1:10:45.513 --> 1:10:48.480
Adam, you are better than
this. What are you doing?

1:10:48.482 --> 1:10:50.315
What I can.

1:10:50.317 --> 1:10:51.951
Hey, look at me.
I know you

1:10:51.953 --> 1:10:53.888
and this isn't you.

1:10:56.323 --> 1:10:57.925
Please don't do this.

1:11:03.531 --> 1:11:04.864
Tonight is the night!

1:11:04.866 --> 1:11:07.099
To remember Hazel!

1:11:07.101 --> 1:11:11.336
To remember Hazel...
and everyone we've lost,

1:11:11.338 --> 1:11:15.473
and to honor them with more
than just thoughts and prayers.

1:11:15.475 --> 1:11:21.714
Tonight we rid ourselves of
these snakes and their poison.

1:11:21.716 --> 1:11:25.818
No more will we watch
our sons and daughters,

1:11:25.820 --> 1:11:30.089
our sisters and brothers,
die in our midst. No more!

1:11:31.526 --> 1:11:33.959
Tonight we take responsibility.

1:11:33.961 --> 1:11:37.763
I take responsibility,
you take responsibility

1:11:37.765 --> 1:11:39.532
for your community.

1:11:39.534 --> 1:11:41.634
And stop the spread
of this fuckin' poison.

1:11:41.636 --> 1:11:43.669
By marching for peace!

1:11:45.372 --> 1:11:46.772
Fuck peace!

1:11:46.774 --> 1:11:49.608
No more! No more.

1:11:49.610 --> 1:11:51.376
For Paul!

1:11:51.378 --> 1:11:54.580
For Paul!

1:11:54.582 --> 1:11:56.849
This is not
what Hazel wanted!

1:12:05.059 --> 1:12:08.527
<i>Residents of Whispering Pines,</i>

1:12:08.529 --> 1:12:10.898
<i>disperse and go home. Now!</i>

1:12:12.767 --> 1:12:16.602
<i>Put down your weapons
and disperse immediately,</i>

1:12:16.604 --> 1:12:20.005
<i>or face arrest.</i>

1:12:20.007 --> 1:12:20.875
Adam!

1:12:26.981 --> 1:12:30.117
Burn! Burn!

1:12:33.154 --> 1:12:36.589
Burn! Burn! Burn!

1:12:36.591 --> 1:12:38.693
Jesus, what have I done?

1:12:40.862 --> 1:12:42.462
Whoo!

1:13:38.519 --> 1:13:39.720
Kenny!

1:13:43.691 --> 1:13:45.492
Kenny!

1:13:47.561 --> 1:13:48.729
Kenny!

1:14:00.107 --> 1:14:01.907
Kenny!

1:14:01.909 --> 1:14:03.611
I know you're
fucking in here.

1:15:17.284 --> 1:15:19.253
Hey, man...

1:15:21.188 --> 1:15:22.688
Where am I?

1:15:27.061 --> 1:15:30.696
I... I can't breathe.

1:15:30.698 --> 1:15:31.630
Good.

1:15:31.632 --> 1:15:33.899
H-Help, man...

1:15:33.901 --> 1:15:35.601
Don't fucking
touch me, man.

1:15:35.603 --> 1:15:37.302
Die. I wanna watch.

1:15:37.304 --> 1:15:38.904
I'm sick...

1:15:42.109 --> 1:15:45.279
Cheyenne was sick.
You fucking killed her.

1:15:46.680 --> 1:15:47.946
Help...

1:15:47.948 --> 1:15:50.115
Don't you
fucking touch me.

1:15:50.117 --> 1:15:52.553
Good. Fucking die.

1:15:54.388 --> 1:15:56.655
Help, man, help...

1:15:56.657 --> 1:15:58.190
Listen.
Listen, listen.

1:15:58.192 --> 1:16:00.292
Listen, hey,
I want you to know this.

1:16:00.294 --> 1:16:02.094
You see this?
Can you see this?

1:16:02.096 --> 1:16:03.998
I'm supposed to fucking
save your life.

1:16:05.366 --> 1:16:06.865
This'll fucking
save your life...

1:16:06.867 --> 1:16:08.400
- I didn't...
- You're gonna fucking die.

1:16:08.402 --> 1:16:10.702
You're gonna die,
'cause you're a piece of shit dealer,

1:16:10.704 --> 1:16:13.038
who dealt to my sister.
You're gonna fucking die.

1:16:13.040 --> 1:16:14.873
- I didn't...
- Motherfucker, you killed her.

1:16:14.875 --> 1:16:17.776
- I didn't kill her.
- You fucking killed her!

1:16:17.778 --> 1:16:19.912
She was my dealer.

1:16:38.365 --> 1:16:40.201
Fuck me...

1:16:41.869 --> 1:16:43.003
Fuck!

1:16:49.009 --> 1:16:50.075
Fuck.

1:16:50.077 --> 1:16:52.444
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

1:17:19.340 --> 1:17:20.407
Dammit.

1:17:22.776 --> 1:17:24.378
Oh, God.

1:17:30.484 --> 1:17:32.818
Oh, God.

1:19:58.499 --> 1:20:00.100
Did you kill him?

1:20:01.503 --> 1:20:02.803
No.

1:20:04.038 --> 1:20:06.405
Why not?

1:20:06.407 --> 1:20:08.909
It's complicated.

1:20:10.277 --> 1:20:13.045
Dealer's soul rot in hell.

1:20:13.047 --> 1:20:14.148
Hmm.

1:20:16.417 --> 1:20:17.883
If you knew the whole story,

1:20:17.885 --> 1:20:19.453
I'm not sure
you'd be saying that.

1:20:23.390 --> 1:20:25.426
Was it all worth it?

1:20:28.563 --> 1:20:30.331
I don't know.

1:20:32.600 --> 1:20:35.503
I, um, I know
it wasn't your fault.

1:20:42.076 --> 1:20:43.944
Maybe things will change.

1:20:46.480 --> 1:20:48.115
Maybe.

1:20:53.655 --> 1:20:55.688
How is he?

1:20:55.690 --> 1:20:57.956
Perfect.

1:20:57.958 --> 1:20:59.358
He's a good little boy.

1:20:59.360 --> 1:21:00.959
Yeah, he is.

1:21:00.961 --> 1:21:03.028
He's been asking
for you all night.

1:21:03.030 --> 1:21:05.063
So...

1:21:05.065 --> 1:21:06.568
I'm gonna go see him.

1:21:08.570 --> 1:21:09.669
Thank you.

1:21:09.671 --> 1:21:11.305
Thank you.

1:21:19.413 --> 1:21:21.380
Hey, buddy. Come here.

1:21:23.518 --> 1:21:26.051
Ohh...

1:21:26.053 --> 1:21:28.019
Hi.

1:21:28.021 --> 1:21:29.454
How you doing?

1:21:29.456 --> 1:21:31.724
- Daddy!
- Yeah?

1:21:34.228 --> 1:21:35.628
Hi, everyone.

1:21:35.630 --> 1:21:37.630
My name is Brittany.

1:21:37.632 --> 1:21:41.366
Now, though you probably
don't know me at all,

1:21:41.368 --> 1:21:44.570
you probably do remember
my Aunt Hazel.

1:21:44.572 --> 1:21:46.972
She reminded us
of the value of life,

1:21:46.974 --> 1:21:49.642
<i>of every life.</i>

1:21:49.644 --> 1:21:53.113
<i>She carried the burden of other
people's poor choices.</i>

1:21:54.682 --> 1:21:57.449
She knew unimaginable loss.

1:21:57.451 --> 1:22:00.485
And she made it her life's
mission to remind us

1:22:00.487 --> 1:22:02.555
that the choices we make
to dismiss those lives

1:22:02.557 --> 1:22:05.123
and turn and look the other way
when our friends and family

1:22:05.125 --> 1:22:06.594
are dying
is not acceptable.

1:22:09.163 --> 1:22:11.231
<i>Something has to change
in our hearts.</i>

1:22:12.567 --> 1:22:16.368
We get a chance
to be that change.

1:22:16.370 --> 1:22:20.305
<i>And it all starts with you remembering
that your decisions have an impact.</i>

1:22:42.496 --> 1:22:44.532
Lieutenant.

1:22:46.634 --> 1:22:49.535
Yeah, not anymore.

1:22:49.537 --> 1:22:52.137
Budget cuts.

1:22:52.139 --> 1:22:55.440
Hmm. Real life.

1:22:55.442 --> 1:22:58.412
So... what you
gonna do now?

1:23:00.648 --> 1:23:03.415
Same as I've always done.

1:23:03.417 --> 1:23:05.518
Protect my town.

1:23:18.499 --> 1:23:21.333
No more death to drugs.

1:23:21.335 --> 1:23:25.103
I remember what
my Aunt Hazel stood for.

1:23:25.105 --> 1:23:28.541
And I remember
what she died for.

1:23:28.543 --> 1:23:31.779
I'm just here today so that
you don't forget either.

1:23:32.647 --> 1:23:35.347
Thank you.

1:29:25.833 --> 1:29:30.002
During filming of this movie,
statistics continue to rise.

1:29:30.004 --> 1:29:31.804
Recent studies
show a predicted

1:29:31.806 --> 1:29:34.874
10 percent increase
of fatalities per year.

1:29:34.876 --> 1:29:37.142
These overwhelming numbers
greatly surpass

1:29:37.144 --> 1:29:39.979
the amount of deaths during
the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

1:29:39.981 --> 1:29:42.214
As these numbers
continue to rise,

1:29:42.216 --> 1:29:45.017
it is time to raise awareness
of this horrible epidemic,

1:29:45.019 --> 1:29:46.619
fight back,

1:29:46.621 --> 1:29:49.056
and create lasting,
significant change.
