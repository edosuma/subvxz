WEBVTT

00:04.506 --> 00:05.965
Val, I need the space.

00:06.841 --> 00:07.967
All right,
guys, clear out.

00:08.051 --> 00:09.010
Everybody out!

00:09.094 --> 00:10.303
Promise me you're
going to clean up.

00:10.387 --> 00:12.639
I can't promise what I'm
going to do or not do.

00:12.722 --> 00:13.723
Promise me...

00:13.807 --> 00:15.100
Obviously,
I'm going to clean up.

00:15.183 --> 00:18.061
Stress is like the uptight
mayor of a town who's saying,

00:18.144 --> 00:20.313
"Hey, we're uptight.
You can't dance."

00:20.397 --> 00:24.109
And then, you have to be like, "Oh,
yeah, Mayor Stress? Well, watch this."

00:24.192 --> 00:26.444
And then, we dance.

00:28.488 --> 00:30.323
Oh, how we dance.

01:05.191 --> 01:06.735
Sex also works.

01:30.550 --> 01:32.302
Hey, Jim's back
from jury duty.

01:32.385 --> 01:35.847
Hey!Tuna!
He's back!

01:36.389 --> 01:37.390
Hey.

01:37.474 --> 01:38.433
Oh, look at this.

01:38.516 --> 01:40.268
Tuna wrap.
Okay.

01:41.728 --> 01:43.062
Hand roll.

01:43.772 --> 01:44.939
How was jury duty?

01:45.190 --> 01:46.483
Pretty uneventful,
actually.

01:46.566 --> 01:48.777
I can't believe they let someone
like you serve on a jury.

01:48.860 --> 01:50.820
Makes me question
the whole judicial system.

01:51.029 --> 01:52.113
What was the case?

01:52.197 --> 01:53.281
A hit and run.

01:53.865 --> 01:55.784
Ooh! The case of the hit and run.
That's exciting.

01:55.867 --> 01:57.202
Did you send him
to the slammer?

01:57.285 --> 01:58.828
No. Not guilty.

01:59.037 --> 02:00.538
Of course you
found him not guilty.

02:01.289 --> 02:04.542
He apologized. And I just
really want him to like me. Mmm!

02:05.251 --> 02:06.336
We're best friends,
actually.

02:06.419 --> 02:08.463
We're going wine tasting next
weekend, if you want to come.

02:08.671 --> 02:09.839
Not coming.
Have plans.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.132
Okay.

02:11.216 --> 02:13.426
I did get called
into jury duty.

02:13.510 --> 02:15.386
And they
released me around noon,

02:15.470 --> 02:17.472
so I didn't
think it was worth it

02:17.555 --> 02:19.599
to come back to work
for a half day.

02:19.682 --> 02:22.644
And then the next morning, Pam was a
little overwhelmed with the kids,

02:22.727 --> 02:25.230
so I took an extra day
to help out.

02:26.231 --> 02:28.691
And then,
three other days happened.

02:29.526 --> 02:30.735
Ah!

02:31.069 --> 02:32.737
Angela had the baby!

02:32.987 --> 02:35.865
Is it black? Because
that would be hilarious.

02:35.949 --> 02:37.033
Why?

02:37.951 --> 02:39.118
You know.

02:39.202 --> 02:42.080
Would it be more hilarious than
Angela having a Chinese baby?

02:42.539 --> 02:45.917
A little bit. Yeah.
Right, guys? Back me up.

02:46.918 --> 02:47.877
Maybe a little bit.

02:47.961 --> 02:49.712
Oh. Did I win the pool?

02:50.213 --> 02:52.298
Uh, no. Right month, wrong year.

02:52.882 --> 02:55.468
No one won the pool. Angela
wasn't due for another month.

02:55.552 --> 02:57.512
We should all go to
the hospital and visit her.

02:57.595 --> 02:59.722
Oh, I'd love to, but...

02:59.973 --> 03:02.350
Oh, man, I would, but I
can't miss any more work.

03:02.433 --> 03:05.937
Well, Kevin and I have to go, because
accounting is its own little family.

03:06.020 --> 03:10.817
Yeah, Oscar's the dad, I'm
Oscar's dad and Angela's my mom.

03:11.317 --> 03:13.653
Everyone,
our very own Angela...

03:13.736 --> 03:15.780
We all got the e-mail. Some
of us are going to go visit.

03:15.989 --> 03:17.532
Oh, I am so in.

03:17.949 --> 03:19.868
I love maternity wards.

03:20.118 --> 03:22.203
It's the perfect blend
of love and horror.

03:22.287 --> 03:25.039
Things can go so
wrong or so right.

03:27.542 --> 03:30.336
Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case.
What were the deets?

03:30.420 --> 03:32.046
It was actually
a pretty boring case.

03:32.130 --> 03:35.174
How could it be boring? You were
there for five days. Titillate us.

03:35.258 --> 03:38.511
Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay
until 6:00 twice to cover for you.

03:38.803 --> 03:40.388
My wife got to
the TV first.

03:40.471 --> 03:43.057
I had to sit through damn
Rizzoli & damn Isles.

03:43.141 --> 03:45.935
Yeah. My car got smashed
visiting one of your clients,

03:46.019 --> 03:49.022
and I had to have it detailed
and they took my meter change.

03:49.355 --> 03:50.398
Wow. I'm really sorry.

03:50.481 --> 03:51.524
Yeah.

03:51.941 --> 03:53.860
I never considered
that my week off

03:53.943 --> 03:56.446
would make everyone
else's job harder.

03:57.614 --> 03:59.657
The least I could do
was give them a good story.

04:00.491 --> 04:01.910
So Phyllis,
he was here and then,

04:01.993 --> 04:04.579
the car came and
it was like that.

04:04.662 --> 04:06.748
Yeah, so it had to be a
double backflip, actually.

04:06.831 --> 04:10.376
You know, when I was on
J-duties, strangler case,

04:10.460 --> 04:15.340
we used to recreate the various stranglings
with empanadas from Ernesto's.

04:15.632 --> 04:17.175
Oh, man, Ernesto's.

04:17.258 --> 04:18.885
That was our
favorite restaurant, too.

04:19.052 --> 04:21.220
You mean food truck.
Ernesto's was a food truck.

04:21.304 --> 04:22.847
Toby, shut your hole
about the empanadas.

04:22.931 --> 04:24.766
Nobody cares
about the empanadas.

04:24.974 --> 04:26.559
I was in Los Angeles
last year.

04:26.643 --> 04:30.104
Jim tricked me into thinking
I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS

04:30.188 --> 04:31.147
but that's not important.

04:31.230 --> 04:34.776
While I was being kicked off the
lot, I saw food trucks everywhere.

04:34.859 --> 04:36.736
Everyone in Los Angeles
eats from them

04:36.819 --> 04:39.822
and nobody calls
them restaurants.

04:46.454 --> 04:49.624
Guys, I don't know
how many of you have seen...

04:49.707 --> 04:51.459
Gabe, bring it in.

04:51.542 --> 04:54.462
I don't know how many of you have
seen a premature baby before.

04:54.545 --> 04:57.423
It's going to be really tiny, so
please don't say anything offensive.

04:57.882 --> 04:59.050
Got that, bimbo?

04:59.133 --> 05:00.635
Got it, bimbo.

05:01.844 --> 05:02.887
Yes?

05:03.471 --> 05:05.014
Knock, knock.

05:05.682 --> 05:06.724
- Hi.
- Uh...

05:09.769 --> 05:12.480
I don't want... What are
you guys doing here?

05:12.563 --> 05:14.857
We wanted to say hi to the
newest little Dunder Mifflinite.

05:14.941 --> 05:20.530
Well, meet our not-so-little bundle
of joy, Philip Halsted Lipton.

05:20.738 --> 05:22.156
Philip is so fat.

05:22.240 --> 05:23.366
Kevin.

05:23.449 --> 05:25.868
You warned me not to say
anything if it was tiny, Oscar.

05:25.952 --> 05:28.830
You didn't prepare me
for a big, giant, fat baby.

05:28.913 --> 05:30.748
Yes, he's substantial.
Hey!

05:30.832 --> 05:33.751
He's more than substantial.
He's a monster.

05:36.796 --> 05:38.006
So this whole
hit and run thing,

05:38.089 --> 05:40.008
there's this one part
I can't figure out.

05:40.091 --> 05:41.551
You said it was
at a four-way stop?

05:41.634 --> 05:42.635
Mmm-hmm.

05:42.760 --> 05:46.806
And the victim rode his bicycle
into the left-hand turn lane,

05:46.889 --> 05:49.600
but the perp was already in
the left-hand turn lane?

05:49.892 --> 05:50.935
Mmm-hmm.

05:51.060 --> 05:54.772
See, that's what I'm having
trouble with, because the fact is

05:56.107 --> 05:58.484
you never said he
was on a bicycle.

06:03.239 --> 06:05.366
Busted, Halpert! Yes!
Wait. No.

06:05.450 --> 06:06.617
Andy, get out here!

06:06.701 --> 06:07.827
I never said he
was on a bicycle.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.245
I just said I
wasn't listening to you.

06:09.328 --> 06:10.580
I am making
a citizen's arrest.

06:10.663 --> 06:11.914
You have the right
to remain silent.

06:11.998 --> 06:13.207
You have the right
to beg for mercy.

06:13.291 --> 06:16.335
You have the right to request
judgment by combat! Dwight's rights!

06:16.753 --> 06:17.879
What's up, gangsters?

06:18.421 --> 06:20.715
Jim was lying
about jury duty.

06:20.798 --> 06:24.135
He was lying the whole time so he
could go do yoga or go canoeing,

06:24.218 --> 06:26.721
I don't know what this pervert likes.
Fire him!

06:27.305 --> 06:29.891
Dwight, not everything
is a conspiracy theory.

06:30.224 --> 06:33.436
I have Jim on the record
saying that the victim...

06:33.519 --> 06:35.646
Dwight,
I have me on the record

06:35.730 --> 06:38.858
saying to you, take a
chill pill, all right?

06:39.150 --> 06:40.485
I don't need to
take a chill pill.

06:40.818 --> 06:41.819
Here, right there.

06:45.656 --> 06:46.908
Down the hatch.

06:46.991 --> 06:49.786
I really don't want
to take a chill pill.

06:50.119 --> 06:53.456
That a boy, good.
Now, chill.

06:53.539 --> 06:54.540
Okay, okay.

06:57.502 --> 07:01.214
But let's just say
that Jim was lying about jury duty,

07:01.297 --> 07:02.882
you would have to
fire him, right?

07:03.674 --> 07:06.594
Yeah, sure. Of course.
I'd fire him to Timbuktu!

07:06.677 --> 07:07.762
Ha-ha!

07:09.430 --> 07:11.182
Good enough for me.

07:12.350 --> 07:13.392
Ah!

07:16.771 --> 07:19.440
And Pam was just going crazy
trying to take care of Philip,

07:19.524 --> 07:21.859
because Cece has been
out of control recently.

07:22.985 --> 07:26.614
Look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth
is I just feel terrible lying to you.

07:26.697 --> 07:29.033
I feel terrible
getting lied to.

07:29.742 --> 07:31.369
No one's ever
lied to me before.

07:33.371 --> 07:34.455
Okay.

07:34.539 --> 07:36.374
I think the best
thing to do right now

07:36.457 --> 07:38.251
is just come clean
and tell everybody...

07:38.334 --> 07:41.129
No. Not after what I told
Dwight about firing you. No.

07:41.212 --> 07:42.213
Here's what
we're going to do.

07:42.922 --> 07:44.882
We're going to have ourselves
a good old fashioned cover-up.

07:45.883 --> 07:48.261
You ever heard of a
Connecticut cover up? No.

07:48.469 --> 07:50.346
You know why you
never heard of it?

07:50.429 --> 07:51.472
Covered it up.

07:52.723 --> 07:54.517
Are you sure you can
keep this under wraps?

07:54.600 --> 07:56.435
They used to
call me King Tut,

07:56.519 --> 07:59.105
because I'm so good at
keeping things under wraps.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.858
My nickname was
actually King Butt,

08:01.941 --> 08:03.693
because I had
a king-sized butt.

08:12.618 --> 08:13.744
Where do you
want it parked?

08:15.246 --> 08:18.666
Okay, everybody!
Gather round.

08:18.749 --> 08:20.793
Got a real special
surprise for you.

08:20.877 --> 08:22.086
Ernesto!

08:22.420 --> 08:23.796
Hola, Toby!

08:31.429 --> 08:34.140
Uh, I'm going to say "I"
when I'm talking for Ernesto,

08:34.223 --> 08:36.475
so instead of,
"He says blah, blah, blah,"

08:36.559 --> 08:39.437
I'm going to say, "I say blah,
blah, blah," but that's for him.

08:39.937 --> 08:43.399
Anyway, it was something
like, he remembers Toby.

08:44.192 --> 08:45.234
"I remember Toby."

08:46.027 --> 08:49.739
Oh, Jim. Hey, this
guy look familiar?

08:50.198 --> 08:51.365
It's the empanada guy.

08:51.449 --> 08:52.575
The empanada guy!

08:52.658 --> 08:56.120
Holy . Damn it, Toby.
No, I wasn't asking you.

08:57.371 --> 08:58.748
Ask him if he
remembers Jim.

09:03.711 --> 09:04.754
No.

09:05.129 --> 09:06.172
He says no.

09:06.255 --> 09:07.506
He says no. Boom!

09:07.590 --> 09:09.133
Yeah, but who remembers
all their customers?

09:09.217 --> 09:11.344
I mean, I can name
like three of our clients.

09:11.427 --> 09:14.472
He remembers Toby, the most
forgettable man in the known world.

09:18.809 --> 09:20.686
He doesn't want
any trouble.

09:20.770 --> 09:22.355
He sees lots of people,

09:22.438 --> 09:25.274
they come from all around to eat
his delicious meat pockets.

09:25.358 --> 09:29.487
Uh, you guys are going to love
these, so empanadas on me.

09:29.570 --> 09:30.571
You guys got to try them.

09:30.655 --> 09:34.909
Usually I'm a burrito guy, but if you
won't tell, I won't. Wink, wink.

09:35.076 --> 09:37.787
Great. And while we're enjoying
these delicious empanadas,

09:37.870 --> 09:40.164
Jim, why don't you
tell us your story again?

09:40.248 --> 09:41.332
Why? Everybody's heard it.

09:41.791 --> 09:43.125
Walk us through it.

09:43.209 --> 09:44.669
What time would you get
there every morning?

09:45.169 --> 09:46.754
Hey, Murder, She Wrote,

09:46.837 --> 09:50.383
how about we drop the whole
Murder, She Wrote thing, okay?

09:50.549 --> 09:53.427
Jim was at the courthouse for
jury duty every morning.

09:53.511 --> 09:56.180
How do I know?
Because I drove him there.

09:56.931 --> 09:58.766
Why?
Why?

09:59.350 --> 10:00.393
Why?

10:02.103 --> 10:03.688
Because my car broke down.

10:04.313 --> 10:05.773
His car broke down,
so he called me

10:05.856 --> 10:06.941
because I live
near the courthouse.

10:07.024 --> 10:09.986
Wait, wait,
you live by the courthouse.

10:10.069 --> 10:13.447
You drove from near the
courthouse out to Jim's house

10:13.531 --> 10:14.991
and then back to
the courthouse?

10:15.074 --> 10:17.618
Thirty minutes out, 30
minutes back, easy hour.

10:17.702 --> 10:19.495
And I would watch
that cute, little tooshy

10:19.578 --> 10:21.831
scurry up those courthouse
stairs every morning,

10:21.914 --> 10:23.582
and that was that.

10:24.125 --> 10:28.045
I'm sorry, do you have
any American Mexican food?

10:28.629 --> 10:30.298
We're getting
buried out there.

10:30.381 --> 10:32.008
What was that stuff about
the car breaking down?

10:32.091 --> 10:33.884
Well, I think you
handled it pretty well.

10:34.010 --> 10:37.430
I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim, I can't
keep spinning gold out of your.

10:37.555 --> 10:39.140
Okay, listen, all right?

10:39.223 --> 10:41.434
Dwight's onto us. He's going
to figure it out really soon.

10:41.517 --> 10:43.352
So let's just get ahead of it.
Let's tell the truth.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.480
I don't even know what
the truth is anymore.

10:47.273 --> 10:48.816
Wow, it's so

10:49.608 --> 10:50.818
healthy.

10:50.901 --> 10:53.446
I'm going to call
him Little Kevin.

10:53.529 --> 10:54.905
No, you will not.

10:54.989 --> 10:58.326
Is he really five pounds? Because
I squat with five pounds.

10:58.868 --> 10:59.952
This...

11:00.453 --> 11:02.371
Yeah, this feels
like more than that.

11:02.455 --> 11:05.082
No,no,no, he's nine
pounds, seven ounces.

11:06.042 --> 11:07.918
Nine pounds? Really?

11:08.419 --> 11:11.839
I thought you said five. You know what?
I was under so many drugs.

11:11.922 --> 11:15.634
I felt like I was at a James
Taylor concert or something.

11:16.761 --> 11:17.803
So, what did you bring?

11:17.887 --> 11:20.973
Oh, yeah, I don't know
if it's right, but...

11:21.057 --> 11:24.352
Well, if it's anything like
that gorgeous wrapping paper,

11:24.435 --> 11:25.519
you hit it
out of the park.

11:26.812 --> 11:27.897
Oh!

11:28.105 --> 11:29.732
Preemie pajamas.

11:29.815 --> 11:31.525
Again, it may not be
the right size, I can...

11:31.609 --> 11:34.987
No, I think he came early
just so he could wear these.

11:35.196 --> 11:36.197
Thank you.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.699
I got Little Kevin
Call of Duty.

11:38.783 --> 11:41.243
This baby is
clearly not premature.

11:41.327 --> 11:43.204
They're lying about
the date it was conceived.

11:43.287 --> 11:45.164
It's very interesting.

11:45.289 --> 11:49.335
And her husband's gay. I don't
even know which thread to follow.

11:57.301 --> 12:00.679
Uh, excuse me, can I have
everyone's attention for a second?

12:00.888 --> 12:02.515
First off, I just want to
say that I'm really sorry.

12:02.598 --> 12:04.392
I didn't know that
my absence last week

12:04.475 --> 12:06.227
would have been
a burden on any of you.

12:06.310 --> 12:09.397
Because, though I did
have jury duty last week,

12:09.897 --> 12:12.983
they did dismiss me
early on Monday.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.821
And I think you're going to
find this pretty hilarious.

12:16.904 --> 12:20.866
I kind of, well,
maybe took the week off.

12:22.284 --> 12:23.244
What?

12:23.327 --> 12:25.371
Funny? No? Nobody laughed.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.457
You're screwed.

12:29.250 --> 12:32.461
Oh! It's happening.
It's really happening.

12:32.545 --> 12:35.297
What the hell, Jim, I
covered for your bony butt.

12:35.381 --> 12:37.591
Pam really needed some help
with the kids, so...

12:37.675 --> 12:39.176
I promise my
intentions were good.

12:39.260 --> 12:40.886
Your clients,
they're all mine.

12:40.970 --> 12:45.307
Jim, I got my ass chewed out because
one of your orders got messed up.

12:45.724 --> 12:47.768
And Andy, you said you drove
him to the courthouse.

12:47.893 --> 12:49.061
Uh, I did.

12:50.187 --> 12:53.190
Every morning. And if I
didn't, then I hope I die.

12:53.524 --> 12:58.028
All right, well, let's get this
show on the road, shall we?

12:58.112 --> 13:01.031
Allow me to give you a hand.
Here we are.

13:01.115 --> 13:03.242
So long, clump mate.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.578
I'm going to miss you.
Truth be told,

13:05.661 --> 13:08.330
I never thought that this was
how it was going to end.

13:08.414 --> 13:10.458
I always thought I was going
to defeat you somehow,

13:10.541 --> 13:11.667
but you've
defeated yourself.

13:12.418 --> 13:14.879
Dwight, cut it out.
I'm not firing Jim.

13:15.004 --> 13:16.630
No,no,no,no,
you said...

13:16.714 --> 13:18.466
I know what I said.

13:18.549 --> 13:22.636
Jim, you're in deep
doo-doo, you understand?

13:22.720 --> 13:24.013
And I have one
thing to say to you,

13:24.096 --> 13:26.307
and I'm going to say it in
front of this whole office.

13:26.390 --> 13:27.725
Look me in the eye.

13:31.395 --> 13:32.480
That's it?

13:33.856 --> 13:35.316
This is crap!

13:37.860 --> 13:40.070
You've reached Gabe Lewis.
I'm currently indisposed.

13:40.154 --> 13:42.072
Leave me a message. Ciao.

13:42.156 --> 13:43.324
Gabe, it's Dwight again.

13:43.407 --> 13:45.493
Highest priority,
triple urgent.

13:45.576 --> 13:48.162
Call me immediately.
That means ASAP.

13:48.829 --> 13:50.664
I'm going to find Gabe,
tell him what Jim did

13:50.748 --> 13:53.751
and let the little stickler do
what he does best, stickle.

13:54.877 --> 13:57.421
Honestly, I can return
this for a larger size.

13:57.630 --> 14:00.424
It's fine. Pajamas aren't
supposed to be baggy, right?

14:00.508 --> 14:01.759
It's not the barrio.

14:03.052 --> 14:06.597
The only premature baby in this
room is the baby this baby ate.

14:09.350 --> 14:10.809
Little Kevin.

14:11.101 --> 14:12.728
Really?
Angela.

14:12.937 --> 14:14.271
Fine. God.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.899
Philip was conceived
nine months ago.

14:18.442 --> 14:20.819
The Senator and I
wanted to wait,

14:21.362 --> 14:23.197
but we had just seen Thor,

14:23.280 --> 14:25.699
and there was way too much
wine in my chicken piccata.

14:25.783 --> 14:27.535
Chicken marsala.
Right.

14:27.618 --> 14:31.205
And, the point is, Philip was
conceived out of wedlock.

14:31.288 --> 14:32.373
Hmm.

14:32.498 --> 14:35.709
And now you all know,
but you can never tell.

14:36.168 --> 14:37.586
I'm serious.

14:39.255 --> 14:40.464
Dwight.

14:40.673 --> 14:41.674
Hey.

14:41.799 --> 14:42.841
Oh. Hey, have you
seen Gabe?

14:42.925 --> 14:45.094
He went to the car or
something, but he'll be back.

14:45.469 --> 14:46.470
Okay.

14:49.640 --> 14:50.891
Don't you want
to see the baby?

14:51.559 --> 14:54.311
Why? I know what Angela and
the Senator look like.

14:54.395 --> 14:56.730
I can mash that up
in my head right now.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.068
I promised I
wouldn't tell.

15:01.318 --> 15:02.361
So don't.

15:02.903 --> 15:06.073
Angela got pregnant
before the wedding.

15:08.284 --> 15:09.368
What?

15:09.618 --> 15:10.744
She got pregnant
before the wedding.

15:10.828 --> 15:12.496
How long before?
A month.

15:19.128 --> 15:20.296
You didn't hear it
from me.

15:20.379 --> 15:21.755
Yes, I did.

15:26.677 --> 15:28.053
Dwight?
Dwight.

15:28.137 --> 15:29.179
I want to see the baby.

15:29.263 --> 15:32.182
Well, Angela will make you cut your fingernails.
It's not worth it.

15:33.017 --> 15:34.101
Oh!

15:34.518 --> 15:35.603
Yes.

15:36.437 --> 15:37.521
Oh!

15:37.730 --> 15:42.484
What a beautiful child. Prominent
forehead, short arms, tiny nose.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.863
You will lead millions,

15:46.530 --> 15:48.866
willingly or as slaves.

15:49.241 --> 15:53.370
That baby is a Schrute, and
unless somebody taught Mose sex,

15:53.704 --> 15:55.372
that baby is mine.

15:56.957 --> 15:58.292
He's hungry.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.461
Oh, that's my cue
to leave.

16:00.544 --> 16:02.254
No, you don't have to. I'm
going to wear this cover.

16:02.338 --> 16:03.505
Still.

16:04.214 --> 16:05.257
Still.

16:05.341 --> 16:06.467
You won't be seeing...

16:08.886 --> 16:09.887
Do you want the giraffe?

16:09.970 --> 16:12.890
Yes, I am bringing my kids in
to help me get out of this hole.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.725
And you all remember
my beautiful wife, Pam.

16:14.808 --> 16:15.851
Hi.

16:16.727 --> 16:18.812
Wow, I really thought I'd
be more excited to be here.

16:18.896 --> 16:20.689
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Game face, baby.
Game face.

16:20.773 --> 16:21.815
Oh, right. Okay.

16:21.899 --> 16:23.609
Hey, Stanley,
it's great to see you!

16:23.692 --> 16:24.652
No, that's overdoing it,
I think.

16:24.735 --> 16:26.820
Hi, Stanley.
Split the difference.

16:26.904 --> 16:28.572
Jim.
Okay. Let's go.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.032
Hi.

16:31.367 --> 16:32.826
Hi, everybody.

16:32.910 --> 16:34.495
What?
Oh, hi.

16:34.578 --> 16:35.954
How about
a little visit?

16:36.038 --> 16:38.999
Wow. What a surprise.
That's crazy.

16:39.083 --> 16:41.001
You guys get to meet
the little heck raisers.

16:41.085 --> 16:42.753
Hey, Angela's back
with her baby.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.505
Yes, well, you guys
all know Cece,

16:44.588 --> 16:46.590
but we wanted to introduce
you to baby Philip.

16:49.426 --> 16:50.719
You guys.

16:53.097 --> 16:55.015
He's licking on my finger
just like my cat does.

16:55.099 --> 16:56.225
Let me have a turn.

16:56.308 --> 16:57.351
No, it's
the pacifier's turn.

16:57.434 --> 16:58.477
All right.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.187
Did you say
something about

17:00.270 --> 17:03.440
this one bringing in
something for these people?

17:03.524 --> 17:06.694
Yes. Cece wanted
to thank everybody

17:06.819 --> 17:10.239
for letting her daddy stay home
with her all last week and play,

17:10.322 --> 17:11.907
so she brought
you a little treat.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.158
Oh, cookies?

17:13.242 --> 17:14.785
No. But that would have
been a really good idea.

17:14.868 --> 17:15.869
That would have
been really good.

17:15.953 --> 17:18.622
No,she
brought you drawings.

17:18.831 --> 17:21.208
Oh, my goodness,
let's take a look at these.

17:21.291 --> 17:25.921
They're usually amazing, so let's see.
Yep, they are.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.381
Uncle Andy.

17:27.464 --> 17:28.507
Oh!

17:28.590 --> 17:29.842
Aunt Phyllis.

17:29.925 --> 17:33.095
Wow. These are incredible.
Cece, did you do these?

17:33.178 --> 17:34.221
No.

17:34.304 --> 17:37.975
She says no to everything. You
know, she thinks my name is "No."

17:38.058 --> 17:39.893
Cece, do you want
some broccoli?

17:39.977 --> 17:40.978
Yes.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.062
No.

17:42.813 --> 17:43.939
It's crazy.

17:44.022 --> 17:46.650
Why am I shorter than the table
that I'm standing next to?

17:47.443 --> 17:49.820
There is crosshatching
in some of these.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.739
That's kind of advanced
for a 2-year-old.

17:51.822 --> 17:54.450
Cece, this is your
big sister, Kelly.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.410
Did you color
this pretty picture?

17:56.493 --> 17:57.536
No.

17:57.661 --> 17:59.830
So then this
means nothing to you?

18:01.373 --> 18:02.666
Hey, Cece,

18:03.041 --> 18:07.463
why don't you draw another picture
for us exactly like this one,

18:07.921 --> 18:10.591
or at least in
the exact same style?

18:10.758 --> 18:13.844
You know what? I don't think you
need to do things on command.

18:13.927 --> 18:16.764
That's very weird. Just take that.
Thank you.

18:16.847 --> 18:20.017
I think we should just wrap
up the show, kiddos, right?

18:20.642 --> 18:22.311
I don't know what
else we can do here.

18:23.520 --> 18:24.772
Okay. All right.

18:24.855 --> 18:26.565
It's okay, sweetie.
All right.

18:26.648 --> 18:28.275
All right. Okay.

18:31.361 --> 18:32.696
It's okay.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.490
I know. I know.
Shh.

18:36.825 --> 18:41.121
Angela, this child is definitely mine.
He looks just like me.

18:41.205 --> 18:42.915
Every baby
looks just like you.

18:42.998 --> 18:44.374
Your face kind of
looks like a baby.

18:44.458 --> 18:48.962
Need I remind you that we were
together a month before the wedding?

18:49.046 --> 18:51.131
That is completely untrue.

18:51.215 --> 18:52.216
Completely true.

18:52.299 --> 18:53.300
No.
Remember?

18:53.383 --> 18:55.260
You said that Robert
was not fulfilling you.

18:55.344 --> 18:56.678
And I said that I
could fulfill you,

18:56.762 --> 18:58.055
and you said,
"I'd like to see you try."

18:58.138 --> 19:00.307
And then I kissed you with the
force of a thousand waterfalls.

19:00.390 --> 19:01.725
That didn't happen.

19:01.809 --> 19:03.393
Then I inserted my
penis into your...

19:03.477 --> 19:05.020
No! Stop it! Dwight.

19:05.103 --> 19:06.230
...vagina and...

19:06.313 --> 19:07.523
And even if it did,
it's just a coincidence.

19:07.606 --> 19:09.149
Admit that there is a chance.
I will not.

19:09.233 --> 19:10.234
Admit it.
I will not.

19:10.275 --> 19:11.276
It's not...

19:12.069 --> 19:13.570
All done?
Yes.

19:13.654 --> 19:15.239
Yes. He's sleeping.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.074
Before I go, may I?

19:17.449 --> 19:18.575
Sure.

19:19.535 --> 19:21.829
Watch the head.
Watch the head.

19:31.672 --> 19:33.590
Nurse! You know that baby in there?
Baby Philip?

19:33.674 --> 19:35.133
Cancel the circumcision.

19:35.217 --> 19:36.218
Who are you?

19:39.096 --> 19:41.056
I just might be his father.

19:41.557 --> 19:43.767
I don't know
what that means.

19:44.309 --> 19:46.436
We're going to
circumcise him.

19:48.772 --> 19:49.857
Cece, want to come?

19:49.940 --> 19:50.899
No!

19:50.983 --> 19:52.526
Want to come play?
Oh, bud, I know.

19:52.609 --> 19:53.569
Do you have a pacifier?

19:53.652 --> 19:55.612
Yeah. I'm looking. I'm
looking for the pacifier.

19:56.154 --> 19:57.698
Cece!
Okay, we're going.

19:57.781 --> 20:00.117
We got to go. All right,
we're going home.

20:01.785 --> 20:03.954
I know. I know, bud. I know.

20:05.789 --> 20:07.833
You gotta grab her.
I'll go grab her. Okay.

20:07.916 --> 20:10.252
Okay. Here we go.
Here we go.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.754
Okay, I'm just going to go down to
the car, and I'm going to put her

20:12.838 --> 20:14.631
in her seat and
I'll be right back up.

20:16.300 --> 20:17.551
We'll see you tomorrow.

20:17.634 --> 20:18.760
No, no, it's okay.
I'll be right back.

20:18.844 --> 20:19.928
No, just go home.

20:20.012 --> 20:22.055
It's all good.
We got this.

20:22.139 --> 20:23.599
I have a kid.

20:23.891 --> 20:25.767
Last week,
Jim at home,

20:27.185 --> 20:28.979
that was no vacation.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.564
Jim, just go.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.608
Hey, we'll be just fine.

20:34.484 --> 20:35.903
Thanks, guys.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.655
All right, here we go.
Let's go.

20:39.531 --> 20:41.158
om

20:41.325 --> 20:42.451
Phew!

20:52.920 --> 20:54.046
Dwight, what the hell?

20:55.213 --> 20:56.715
You can't smoke in here.

20:56.798 --> 20:58.300
Oh, all right.

20:59.217 --> 21:00.260
Ah!

21:00.344 --> 21:02.638
The office looks different now.
Mmm.

21:02.846 --> 21:04.056
Smaller.

21:04.723 --> 21:06.725
Maybe I just feel bigger.

21:07.059 --> 21:08.101
Hello, Gabe.

21:08.185 --> 21:09.311
You had something
important to tell me?

21:10.187 --> 21:14.524
Oh. You know, I did, but now it
seems infinitely insignificant.

21:15.233 --> 21:18.904
Jim? Oh, right.
No, forget it.

21:18.987 --> 21:21.490
He was doing it for his kids.
I get it.

21:21.698 --> 21:24.117
Kids drive us dads crazy.

21:24.201 --> 21:25.911
Sometimes I feel
like they're raising us.

21:26.244 --> 21:27.621
Am I right?
