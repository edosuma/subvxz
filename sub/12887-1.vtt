WEBVTT

01:13.699 --> 01:15.326
Leaving already?

01:16.202 --> 01:17.161
Hey.

01:18.788 --> 01:19.914
Yeah, I gotta go.

01:21.832 --> 01:22.917
So early?

01:23.542 --> 01:25.044
I've got some appointments.

01:28.339 --> 01:29.423
I'll call you, okay?

01:30.466 --> 01:31.926
Sit down a moment.

01:43.145 --> 01:45.147
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.068
Shall I make us some coffee?

01:49.735 --> 01:51.779
That's sweet, but I'm already late.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.697
What about tonight?

01:54.532 --> 01:56.700
- I don't think I can make it.
- Why?

01:59.495 --> 02:01.080
I've got a million things to do.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.374
So what do you have to do?

02:47.501 --> 02:49.378
- Hi.
- Hello.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.277
Niko Fischer,
"repeatedly tested positive

05:18.610 --> 05:21.030
for alcohol during
general traffic stops."

05:21.405 --> 05:22.656
Is that correct so far?

05:23.115 --> 05:24.491
That is correct, yes.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.118
Are you nervous?

05:26.618 --> 05:28.537
- A little.
- There's no need.

05:31.790 --> 05:35.044
Although actually this is about
your driver's license, isn't it?

05:38.505 --> 05:40.758
MPA, do you know
what that stands for?

05:42.343 --> 05:44.511
Medical Psychological Assessment.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.847
Also known in the vernacular as...?

05:48.682 --> 05:50.684
- An idiot's test?
- Right. An idiot's test.

05:51.060 --> 05:53.771
And who do you think is
the idiot here: you or me?

05:55.064 --> 05:56.023
Well, me...

05:56.398 --> 05:57.524
Because?

05:58.025 --> 06:01.070
Because I was an idiot

06:01.612 --> 06:04.698
and now you have to assess
if I can drive again.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.326
Right.
You've been paying attention.

06:08.494 --> 06:13.165
So, last time,
they pulled you over with 0.07%.

06:13.749 --> 06:16.835
That's only just over the limit,
isn't it?

06:17.836 --> 06:20.547
If you have to drive,
you shouldn't drink at all.

06:20.923 --> 06:24.051
Yes. But one glass should be ok,
shouldn't it? A small one?

06:24.802 --> 06:26.428
Not if you still have to drive.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.181
But 0.07%, I mean,

06:29.890 --> 06:31.266
that's like when my wife

06:31.642 --> 06:34.269
scoffs three rum chocolate bars
every night.

06:35.396 --> 06:38.023
Or do you think
my wife is a danger to traffic?

06:40.776 --> 06:42.444
Let's put it this way:

06:44.279 --> 06:48.867
if your wife has 0.07%
after three bars of rum chocolate,

06:49.952 --> 06:52.996
then legally
she's not allowed to drive.

06:53.789 --> 06:57.418
Is that something you're involved with?
Laws, rules?

06:58.085 --> 07:00.003
I did study law.

07:00.754 --> 07:01.964
Ah, a lawyer.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.049
No, not a graduate.

07:04.758 --> 07:05.843
Because“.

07:06.802 --> 07:09.304
Because I dropped out.

07:10.264 --> 07:11.306
Because“.

07:15.477 --> 07:18.188
Because I realized
that it might not have been for me.

07:19.731 --> 07:21.900
And what did your parents say
to that?

07:22.443 --> 07:24.069
They weren't pleased, naturally.

07:24.486 --> 07:26.405
But otherwise
you get on well with them?

07:26.780 --> 07:28.449
Yes, very well.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.203
Are you in a relationship
at the moment?

07:36.457 --> 07:37.583
Mr. Fischer?

07:38.000 --> 07:39.585
Are you in a relationship?

07:40.002 --> 07:41.712
I understood the question.

07:42.504 --> 07:43.589
I understood.

07:43.964 --> 07:47.050
Then I'll write:
"Won't answer the question."

07:47.718 --> 07:50.262
I really don't want
to sound rude, but

07:51.305 --> 07:54.892
do such specific questions
really belong here?

07:55.267 --> 07:56.351
Specific?

07:56.852 --> 07:58.854
Mr. Fischer, I can get
a lot more specific.

07:59.271 --> 08:00.606
Are you gay?

08:01.773 --> 08:05.444
Do you have an inferiority complex
because you're so short?

08:06.570 --> 08:10.282
Mr. Fischer, are you an alcoholic
because you're so teeny weeny?

08:10.657 --> 08:11.909
I'm not an alcoholic.

08:12.284 --> 08:14.453
Sometimes
I drink nothing for months.

08:14.912 --> 08:17.706
Nothing means nothing
0.07% means 0.07%.

08:24.254 --> 08:25.756
Did you drink anything today?

08:28.258 --> 08:29.843
No coffee, no water?

08:32.763 --> 08:35.265
Yes, of course.
I've had some water.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.144
So, drinking automatically means
alcohol to you, right?

08:39.561 --> 08:41.563
- No. I misunderstood.
- Misunderstood what?

08:41.938 --> 08:43.774
- I wasn't expecting...
- Expecting what?

08:44.274 --> 08:46.860
I wasn't expecting
such a leading question.

08:48.195 --> 08:51.031
A leading question?
Come on, Mr. Fischer...

08:51.615 --> 08:53.575
I'm a psychologist,
not a verbal acrobat.

08:53.992 --> 08:57.371
I'd also rather party every night,
but that's not how it works.

08:57.788 --> 09:00.332
- Forget about your driver's license for now.
- Why?

09:00.791 --> 09:03.669
Because I think it's best.
You appear emotionally unstable

09:04.169 --> 09:06.922
and your current situation
suggests a possible relapse.

09:07.422 --> 09:09.758
You can't judge that so quickly!

09:10.342 --> 09:11.343
Can't I?

09:16.473 --> 09:17.558
I just did!

09:21.353 --> 09:22.688
Have a nice day, Mr. Fischer.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.571
- Good morning.
- Morning.

10:13.488 --> 10:14.656
So, What'll it be?

10:15.157 --> 10:17.200
- Coffee, please.
- To go, right?

10:17.618 --> 10:18.994
What kind?

10:19.911 --> 10:22.456
- Just normal coffee.
- Wanna try something new?

10:22.831 --> 10:25.083
Today's special is the Marocchino.

10:25.542 --> 10:28.378
For <i>2</i> Euros extra, you get
a doughnut or seed roll,

10:28.920 --> 10:30.130
all home-made and organic.

10:30.714 --> 10:32.799
I think I'll stick with coffee.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.010
Sure, we've got two kinds:

10:35.385 --> 10:37.262
the Arabica or
the Colombia Morning.

10:37.971 --> 10:41.892
Which coffee tastes
most like regular coffee?

10:43.268 --> 10:44.770
I like both.

10:46.521 --> 10:48.273
Fine, I'll take the Colombia.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.525
The Colombia, then.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.245
You want milk?

11:02.746 --> 11:04.331
- We've got soy milk.
- No, thanks.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.625
Okay, then.
Three Euros forty, please.

11:07.793 --> 11:09.795
Without today's special.
Just the coffee.

11:10.295 --> 11:11.963
Yes, three Euros forty, please.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.177
Three forty for a regular coffee?

11:17.719 --> 11:19.096
Yeah, that's the Colombia.

11:20.055 --> 11:21.640
You could have mentioned that.

11:21.973 --> 11:24.476
I've got two, twenty,

11:24.851 --> 11:28.063
sixty, seventy, eighty.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.107
That's not enough.

11:31.149 --> 11:32.859
Can't you make an exception?

11:38.115 --> 11:39.658
Sorry, I really can't.

11:40.033 --> 11:43.662
Otherwise every burn
will want their coffee for free.

11:43.995 --> 11:46.289
- Bum?
- Yeah, bum!

13:24.054 --> 13:26.348
Hello, Mrs. Mosebach,
it's Niko Fischer.

13:26.723 --> 13:29.559
Could I speak to my Dad, please?

13:29.935 --> 13:32.270
Could you ask him to call me?

14:13.436 --> 14:14.938
You just moved in, didn't you?

14:15.981 --> 14:17.941
Yeah, a couple of weeks ago.
Why?

14:18.316 --> 14:20.610
Karl Speckenbach.
I live upstairs with my wife.

14:20.986 --> 14:22.445
I wanted to introduce myself.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.866
- Welcome.
- Wow, thank you!

14:26.533 --> 14:29.035
A little welcome present.
My wife's meatballs.

14:29.411 --> 14:30.579
That's kind.
Thank you.

14:31.329 --> 14:33.039
She was in the kitchen all morning.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.751
I have to admit I already
nabbed two on my way down.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.883
They're really good. Try one!

14:56.605 --> 14:59.107
- Aren't they good?
- Oh yeah.

15:00.150 --> 15:02.068
- Moving is a lot of work, right?
- Yes.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.529
I haven't really moved in yet.

15:04.905 --> 15:07.657
I watched you carry
all those boxes from my window.

15:08.199 --> 15:10.702
Usually
I wouldn't hesitate to help,

15:11.369 --> 15:13.455
but my wife says
I should take care of my back.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.750
- I slipped a disc last year.
- That doesn't sound good.

15:19.169 --> 15:20.712
What doesn't sound good?

15:22.547 --> 15:24.049
The thing with your back.

15:24.966 --> 15:27.010
Ah, that.
It's no big deal.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.266
Well, as I said,

15:34.100 --> 15:36.770
I just moved in,
I can't really offer you anything.

15:39.522 --> 15:40.649
Cheers.

15:44.527 --> 15:47.113
Did you watch the game last night?
Champions League?

15:48.406 --> 15:50.700
Sensational game.
Do you like football?

15:51.576 --> 15:52.702
Sometimes.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.372
I'm crazy about football.

15:56.122 --> 15:59.459
I installed a hobby room
in the basement.

16:00.043 --> 16:03.546
With a couch, table football,
flat screen, the whole shebang.

16:04.381 --> 16:06.591
And that's where I sit
and watch all the games.

16:07.759 --> 16:10.095
And sometimes
I watch special films there.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.685
- Is that your girl?
- That's an old photo.

16:17.894 --> 16:20.647
That's your sweetheart, huh?
Am I right?

16:22.524 --> 16:24.109
Where was that taken?

16:25.318 --> 16:26.486
Paris.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.199
Paris...

16:32.993 --> 16:35.620
Somehow I envy you.
Young, in love,

16:36.997 --> 16:38.832
probably thinking of kids too?

16:41.835 --> 16:43.378
And you?
Do you have kids?

16:48.842 --> 16:51.302
My wife and I don't get up
to much these days.

16:51.928 --> 16:52.971
Nothing...

16:53.471 --> 16:55.473
We used to do it all the time,
everywhere,

16:55.849 --> 16:57.726
but for the last five years,
nothing.

16:59.060 --> 17:02.230
Cancer, breast cancer,
all of a sudden, just like that.

17:09.779 --> 17:12.115
They took her whole rack,
you know?

17:14.784 --> 17:16.243
I tried.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.580
I wanted to explain.

17:20.457 --> 17:22.625
I'm sorry.
I just can't.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.757
Instead I'm down in my basement.

17:30.216 --> 17:36.431
And she's upstairs,
cooking and cooking and cooking.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.142
What am I supposed to do?

17:41.519 --> 17:43.605
What am I supposed to do?

17:49.235 --> 17:52.030
Haven't you got anyone to talk to?

17:52.405 --> 17:53.615
Like who?

17:55.950 --> 17:59.579
I don't know.
Maybe an old friend.

18:01.081 --> 18:04.959
Damn women, they wear you out,
man, they wear you out.

19:05.270 --> 19:06.688
Yes?

19:07.188 --> 19:08.731
Matze... Hello.

19:57.488 --> 19:59.574
Someone should clean up this city.

20:01.117 --> 20:03.661
I said, someone
should clean up this city.

20:04.078 --> 20:07.332
Because
it's full of filth and scum.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.168
I get headaches

20:10.919 --> 20:13.630
every time I go for a walk
and have to smell this filth.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.381
Unbelievable.

20:15.798 --> 20:17.884
The headaches keep getting worse.

20:19.135 --> 20:20.428
I have an idea.

20:21.262 --> 20:24.557
The president
should burn down the city,

20:25.350 --> 20:28.061
or flush it down a huge toilet.

20:32.023 --> 20:33.274
"Taxi Driver"?

20:34.150 --> 20:35.193
Exactly.

20:38.821 --> 20:39.822
Thank you.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.201
Yes, a coffee, please.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.288
A mineral water.

21:20.571 --> 21:21.781
Niko?

21:24.409 --> 21:26.494
- Niko Fischer?
- Yes?

21:27.495 --> 21:29.747
Wicked!
Julika.

21:30.331 --> 21:34.002
Julika Hoffmann.
We went to school together!

21:35.003 --> 21:36.296
- Sure?
- Yes,

21:36.796 --> 21:39.507
I was about
three times bigger then.

21:41.009 --> 21:43.803
You and the others
used to call me Roly Poly Julie.

21:44.470 --> 21:45.471
Julika.

21:46.306 --> 21:47.432
Now I remember...

21:48.558 --> 21:51.686
- That's like 11, 12...
- 13 years ago.

21:52.061 --> 21:54.689
Crazy!
You look completely different.

21:55.523 --> 21:56.607
Thankfully.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.944
- So... grab a seat!
- I don't wanna interrupt.

22:00.570 --> 22:02.739
You're not interrupting.
Please, sit down.

22:03.364 --> 22:04.324
Thanks.

22:05.325 --> 22:06.367
- This is Matze.
- Hello.

22:06.743 --> 22:08.286
Hello.

22:09.620 --> 22:12.373
- Insane!
- So! What are you doing?

22:13.541 --> 22:15.501
Yeah, I'm...

22:16.919 --> 22:18.921
And you? Tell me.
How are you?

22:19.881 --> 22:21.716
I don't know if you remember,

22:22.133 --> 22:24.510
but I was transferred
to boarding school.

22:24.886 --> 22:26.304
Yes... I remember.

22:26.804 --> 22:30.141
Yeah, it was a boarding school
for overweight kids.

22:31.434 --> 22:33.227
But it helped a lot.

22:33.895 --> 22:37.315
Well, that sounds... that sounds
really, really good, right?

22:37.899 --> 22:40.318
Yeah. Oh boy,
I had such a crush on you.

22:42.236 --> 22:44.322
In spite of all the humiliation.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.367
It's a difficult age,
isn't it? 13, 14?

22:47.742 --> 22:52.663
Totally! You cry all night long,
you harm yourself.

22:54.207 --> 22:56.501
Once I even tried to kill myself.

23:02.799 --> 23:04.634
Yeah,
that was the reason my parents

23:05.051 --> 23:06.636
sent me to that boarding school.

23:07.678 --> 23:09.097
Anyway.
No hard feelings.

23:11.015 --> 23:13.351
<i>'</i> AnVWaV, I've got to go.
- Already?

23:15.520 --> 23:18.606
- What are you doing tonight?
- Actually, we've got no plans.

23:19.107 --> 23:21.442
Well, I might have one or two
appointments. Why?

23:22.110 --> 23:26.531
There's a performance art show.
I don't know if you're into that?

23:27.073 --> 23:29.075
Are you kidding?
I'm an actor.

23:29.659 --> 23:32.995
To be honest, I'm in it.
Anyway, think about it.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.373
I'll leave two tickets
for you.

23:35.790 --> 23:38.793
Okay, I'll see if we can make it.

23:40.253 --> 23:42.046
What the hell!
We'll definitely come.

23:42.547 --> 23:44.006
Really? Great!

23:48.094 --> 23:49.220
Niko Fischer...

23:51.431 --> 23:52.390
Wicked.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.562
Roly Poly Julie.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.320
What time does it start?

24:07.655 --> 24:08.656
Nine.

24:09.282 --> 24:11.409
Okay, I'll pick you up at eight thirty?

24:12.577 --> 24:14.203
I don't think that's a good idea.

24:14.871 --> 24:17.415
Of course it is.
She's giving us tickets.

24:23.171 --> 24:24.130
Hello?

24:25.965 --> 24:28.718
We're almost there.
I'm bringing a friend.

24:29.594 --> 24:31.429
You freak. See you in a moment.

24:35.349 --> 24:38.269
Friend of mine.
Works round the corner.

24:38.936 --> 24:40.938
Can you drop me at home first?

25:01.959 --> 25:03.461
Hey, Matze, this is great!

25:04.253 --> 25:05.338
Heil Hitler!

25:05.713 --> 25:08.341
Yeah, totally Heil Hitler!
Come here, man!

25:10.176 --> 25:12.011
- So, how's it going?
- Fantastic.

25:12.386 --> 25:15.014
- My pal, Niko.
- Nice to meet you. Philipp Rauch.

25:15.389 --> 25:17.558
Great to see you guys.
Come on in!

25:19.769 --> 25:22.897
I'm sorry, it's a mess.
Somebody really needs to clean up.

25:23.523 --> 25:25.566
- Close the door?
- Yeah, close it.

25:26.609 --> 25:29.820
- This is bigger than my apartment.
- It's too big, I totally agree.

25:30.947 --> 25:32.365
That suit looks good on you.

25:32.949 --> 25:34.492
Imagine this gone.

25:35.076 --> 25:37.495
Just the cut and fabric.
What do you think?

25:37.954 --> 25:39.664
Actually, you look like my Grandpa.

25:40.456 --> 25:42.416
"Well, Rommel? The game's up.

25:43.292 --> 25:47.255
Drop your pants!
Or I'll cut your ugly tongue out!"

25:47.838 --> 25:51.092
"Heil Hitler!"
That's the Matze I know.

25:53.135 --> 25:55.054
Spot on.
Sit down, come on.

25:55.763 --> 25:57.723
Get rid of those damned autographs.

25:58.558 --> 26:01.602
So, tell me, is there
a role going in this for me?

26:02.812 --> 26:04.939
Maybe something small.
I can ask right now.

26:05.314 --> 26:06.399
Only if you don't mind.

26:06.857 --> 26:10.319
No, not at all. I play the lead.
You as well?

26:11.571 --> 26:14.073
- No, thanks.
- Why not? It would be awesome!

26:14.448 --> 26:16.993
- I really don't want to. Thanks.
- Suit yourself.

26:19.328 --> 26:20.746
But what's it about?

26:21.330 --> 26:22.873
- What, you mean the film?
- Yeah.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.418
Yeah, what's the actual story?

26:26.168 --> 26:28.296
What's it about?
That's a good question.

26:30.172 --> 26:34.594
I play a young sensitive writer
just before the Second World War

26:34.969 --> 26:38.014
who falls in love
with a beautiful bookseller

26:38.389 --> 26:40.474
but doesn't know she's Jewish.

26:41.309 --> 26:44.270
And then war breaks out
and they lose touch,

26:44.645 --> 26:48.691
and six years later,
I'm a loyal officer who toes the line--

26:49.483 --> 26:52.570
not blindly,
I've still got a conscience--

26:53.404 --> 26:56.657
and I'm conducting a house search
where the Jews live,

26:57.241 --> 26:59.035
and now comes the moment

26:59.994 --> 27:02.079
when all of a sudden,

27:02.622 --> 27:06.500
he meets Hannah again.
That's the name of the bookseller.

27:07.418 --> 27:10.463
And now my character's facing
a conflict, you know.

27:12.173 --> 27:15.760
Save, betray, save, betray,
how, why, what, you know.

27:17.470 --> 27:19.972
And at the very last moment,
he makes a decision

27:20.806 --> 27:23.100
and saves her from...

27:25.311 --> 27:27.146
- Deportation.
- Deportation, thanks.

27:27.647 --> 27:30.608
Then he hides her in the basement.
Love breaks out once again.

27:31.442 --> 27:32.610
And one night,

27:33.861 --> 27:36.739
she suddenly confesses to him...

27:37.865 --> 27:39.116
Guess what?

27:43.954 --> 27:46.123
That they have a child together?

27:46.916 --> 27:49.168
Jakob, a little boy, six years old.

27:51.545 --> 27:53.422
And they took him from her.

27:55.591 --> 27:58.302
That's the moment,
for this Heinrich guy,

27:58.678 --> 28:00.971
when something breaks
inside of him.

28:01.972 --> 28:03.808
It's total catharsis,

28:04.225 --> 28:07.186
and he wants this kid,
he wants his boy...

28:11.190 --> 28:14.694
Then it gets really dramatic and...
but I won't spoil the ending.

28:18.114 --> 28:19.281
Who makes this stuff up?

28:19.699 --> 28:21.742
I hope this is based
on a true story?

28:22.284 --> 28:24.578
Yeah, well,
it was the Second World War.

28:38.509 --> 28:40.928
Hey, Niko, come here.

28:42.888 --> 28:45.349
Come here. I won't bite.

28:51.564 --> 28:52.773
Come on, Niko, sit down.

28:53.315 --> 28:55.860
You can see it on the monitor.

29:00.322 --> 29:02.575
<i>So 'now do you and Maize
know each other'?</i>

29:03.033 --> 29:04.994
We met in the neighborhood.

29:07.246 --> 29:08.748
- Okay, done.
- Thank you, Connie.

29:10.750 --> 29:11.917
- And you?
- Pardon?

29:12.418 --> 29:15.129
- How do you know Matze?
- Acting school.

29:16.380 --> 29:17.590
That was ages ago.

29:18.591 --> 29:22.762
If anyone had real talent,
it was our friend there.

29:23.763 --> 29:27.099
Just a few months into acting school
and he already had an audition.

29:27.641 --> 29:29.143
I was passing this door,

29:30.102 --> 29:32.313
it was just open,
and I see this guy act.

29:33.189 --> 29:35.357
People went nuts, I tell you.

29:36.650 --> 29:40.237
Thousands of offers:
TV, cinema, theater, everything.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.616
There were some really
good things there, I tell you.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.160
What happened?

29:46.869 --> 29:49.955
Nothing. He turned everything down.
Thought everything sucked.

29:50.581 --> 29:53.292
Instead he sat around in bars
waiting for the right role.

29:53.667 --> 29:55.044
But it never came.

29:56.545 --> 29:57.505
Don't get me wrong.

29:58.088 --> 29:59.298
I love the guy.

30:00.090 --> 30:02.593
He's a fantastic actor
and a great human being.

30:04.887 --> 30:06.013
I know.

30:07.348 --> 30:09.767
Speak of the devil...
Matze, come over here.

30:10.434 --> 30:11.769
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

30:13.020 --> 30:15.272
- So, what's the boss say?
- Looks good.

30:15.648 --> 30:17.858
He'll call me back tomorrow.

30:18.692 --> 30:19.985
See how easy it is?

30:20.778 --> 30:21.779
Ready to roll.

30:23.364 --> 30:24.573
Guys, I gotta go.

30:25.491 --> 30:26.700
Duty calls.

30:27.993 --> 30:29.328
Don't run away!

30:33.916 --> 30:36.001
- Sound?
- Sound speed.

30:44.051 --> 30:45.094
Hannah!

30:54.728 --> 30:56.021
What's up?

30:57.773 --> 30:58.858
Heinrich?

31:00.484 --> 31:01.652
War is over.

31:10.744 --> 31:11.829
What did you say?

31:12.997 --> 31:15.624
Yes, Hannah, you heard me right.
Berlin's been taken.

31:16.375 --> 31:19.253
There's word in the street
that Hitler has surrendered.

31:22.506 --> 31:24.425
But that means we're free at last!

31:24.967 --> 31:27.970
No,you.
You are free, Hannah.

31:32.683 --> 31:34.727
Now I'm the one who has to hide.

31:36.312 --> 31:38.856
No, I'll tell everyone
what you did for me.

31:39.565 --> 31:42.192
The whole world must know
that you weren't part of this.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.653
You've no idea what I've done...

31:51.994 --> 31:53.203
Beautiful Hannah.

31:55.164 --> 31:56.248
Farewell.

32:17.144 --> 32:18.395
Just a second, please.

32:18.812 --> 32:21.065
<i>I can hardly hear you.
Why is that?</i>

32:22.942 --> 32:24.068
Okay, now.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.195
<i>Where are you?
I can hardly hear you.</i>

32:26.570 --> 32:29.907
I was in the library.
I can't talk there, you know.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.618
<i>The library?
Sounds like you're working hard.</i>

32:32.993 --> 32:35.287
- So to speak.
- Good to hear.

32:35.996 --> 32:37.081
<i>You called?</i>

32:37.456 --> 32:39.249
That's right, I called...

32:39.625 --> 32:41.418
<i>I called back
but I got voice-mail.</i>

32:41.794 --> 32:42.670
I'm sorry...

32:43.128 --> 32:44.922
Do you ever <i>check</i>
your messages?

32:45.631 --> 32:46.674
Sometimes, yeah.

32:47.508 --> 32:50.636
<i>If I didn't answer, this shit house
would close tomorrow.</i>

32:51.011 --> 32:53.806
I called, because my cash card
was swallowed this morning.

32:54.181 --> 32:56.934
<i>Really? I'm about to drive down
into the parking lot,</i>

32:57.267 --> 32:58.852
<i>but I'll be on the course soon.</i>

32:59.228 --> 33:01.271
<i>Why don't you swing by?
We can talk then.</i>

33:01.647 --> 33:03.399
Okay, I can manage that.
And if not--

33:03.983 --> 33:05.067
Okay, see you there.

33:09.196 --> 33:10.364
Fuck.

33:20.791 --> 33:22.167
Waggling.

33:34.471 --> 33:37.182
Fuck me,
that was at least 200 meters.

33:38.058 --> 33:41.061
- Maybe even 250.
- Ah, the champ is here.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.814
Always late,
but he always gets there.

33:45.024 --> 33:45.983
Hello.

33:46.358 --> 33:47.901
- What's up?
- How are you?

33:48.277 --> 33:50.029
You know,
bad people are always fine.

33:51.030 --> 33:54.533
Schneider, my new assistant.
Niki, my favorite son.

33:54.908 --> 33:57.536
- His only one.
- Don't be too sure about that.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.456
- Pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

34:00.831 --> 34:03.751
Grab an iron. Let's get rid of
some of these balls.

34:04.209 --> 34:06.003
I don't know if that's
a good idea.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.839
Come on, don't be a sissy.
Show us what you got!

34:09.214 --> 34:10.215
Hit it!

34:16.847 --> 34:18.014
All right, then.

34:28.859 --> 34:31.027
Weak.
Really weak.

34:31.904 --> 34:33.237
Your stance is wrong, Niki.

34:33.781 --> 34:36.824
Take the right angle to the
hitting direction, like you learned.

34:37.659 --> 34:38.659
Like that?

34:40.454 --> 34:43.290
My dear child,
you mustn't bend your wrist.

34:43.791 --> 34:48.212
Leading arm straight, a swing,
a single motion, follow through.

34:49.004 --> 34:51.172
Wonderful!
Schneider, give it a go.

34:57.096 --> 34:58.055
Hello!

35:06.313 --> 35:07.356
Supeﬂ

35:08.023 --> 35:11.568
Last two balls, Schneider vs. Niko.
Loser buys the drinks.

35:21.703 --> 35:24.540
150, good, that's gonna be hard.

35:26.500 --> 35:29.795
Schneider, it looks a little gay
but it works.

35:34.216 --> 35:37.553
Imagine who you'd
smack over the head with that club.

35:39.471 --> 35:42.307
When the posture is right,
hit it hard!

35:56.655 --> 35:59.616
Well, then, I'll get the drinks.
What's it gonna be?

36:00.659 --> 36:01.994
Coffee would be great.

36:02.369 --> 36:04.538
No way,
it's much too late for coffee.

36:04.955 --> 36:07.958
- You could use a schnapps!
- Isn't it a bit early?

36:08.542 --> 36:11.295
- Come on, we'll have three schnapps!
- Three schnapps.

36:13.630 --> 36:17.134
Schneider's a good man.
Finished his law studies last year.

36:17.676 --> 36:18.635
Okay.

36:21.096 --> 36:22.723
One year younger than you.

36:25.726 --> 36:26.935
And how about you?

36:27.895 --> 36:31.481
All good.
I think I'll be done next year.

36:32.191 --> 36:34.860
If you have time,
I'd like some advice from you.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.695
Any time.

36:40.824 --> 36:42.618
What's your professor's name again?

36:43.869 --> 36:46.580
- You mean Kollath, right?
- Dr. Kollath.

36:47.456 --> 36:50.667
Very nice, competent,
good professor.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.925
So what about this bank thing?

36:59.426 --> 37:00.594
Right. What's that about?

37:00.969 --> 37:04.097
The cash machine kept my card.
Really strange.

37:04.473 --> 37:05.724
Very odd.

37:07.935 --> 37:10.479
- So, then. Cheers.
- Actually you have to drive.

37:11.813 --> 37:13.440
- Excuse me?
- Schneider.

37:14.233 --> 37:16.026
Get the car, please.
We have to leave.

37:19.029 --> 37:21.365
- Very nice meeting you.
- Thanks. You too.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.581
Yeah, how do we solve
the bank thing?

37:30.999 --> 37:32.626
Niko, why are you lying to me?

37:34.878 --> 37:37.005
I met your professor last week.

37:37.506 --> 37:38.757
At a convention in Zurich.

37:39.549 --> 37:42.052
He told me you dropped out
two years ago.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.012
He couldn't tell me why.

37:44.554 --> 37:46.014
My question to you, Niko,

37:46.723 --> 37:49.268
is what have you
been up to the last two years

37:49.643 --> 37:52.896
while I've been transferring
money for your studies every month?

37:57.025 --> 37:58.318
I've been thinking.

38:01.196 --> 38:02.447
You've been thinking?

38:08.078 --> 38:09.871
And about what,
if I might ask?

38:11.915 --> 38:14.835
About me, about you...

38:16.461 --> 38:17.713
about everything.

38:18.630 --> 38:21.591
I transfer a thousand Euros a month
so you can think about me?

38:27.931 --> 38:31.101
Listen, when your mother
squeezed you out, I was 24.

38:31.560 --> 38:34.771
I didn't have time to think.
I had to make money!

38:35.147 --> 38:38.066
I was taking exams by day
and working by night

38:38.442 --> 38:40.694
because Niko wanted
trumpet lessons

38:41.361 --> 38:43.322
and dropped out after a year.

38:43.697 --> 38:46.575
Niko wanted Capoeira
lessons and dropped out after a year.

38:46.992 --> 38:49.328
Niko wanted fencing,
guitar, piano lessons

38:49.703 --> 38:51.163
and dropped them all.

38:52.331 --> 38:55.751
Why aren't I surprised that
you dropped out of your studies?

38:56.752 --> 38:58.045
You're like your mother.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.727
Anything else
you want to say?

39:19.107 --> 39:20.108
Here.

39:22.235 --> 39:23.820
Your account is closed.

39:26.948 --> 39:28.742
I'll give you a tip: cut your hair,

39:29.117 --> 39:32.162
buy some decent shoes and
get a job, like everyone else.

39:32.579 --> 39:35.707
The only thing I can do,
is do nothing for you anymore.

39:38.668 --> 39:40.670
It was lovely, a real pleasure.

42:10.195 --> 42:12.822
- Okay, I need your ID, please.
- Your ID.

42:13.323 --> 42:16.660
- The machine was broken.
- Maybe, but still I need your ID.

42:17.202 --> 42:18.203
Absolutely not.

42:18.578 --> 42:20.080
- Absolutely.
- ID, please.

42:20.455 --> 42:23.917
Listen, I tried to buy a ticket,
but the machine was broken.

42:24.292 --> 42:27.587
Do you understand?
If you want people to buy tickets,

42:27.963 --> 42:30.215
make sure
those things are working.

42:30.632 --> 42:34.094
A broken ticket machine
can never be ruled out.

42:34.469 --> 42:35.554
See? There you go!

42:35.929 --> 42:38.807
In that case you have to
get off at the next station

42:39.224 --> 42:41.810
to purchase a ticket
to resume your ride accordingly.

42:42.185 --> 42:43.228
Accordingly!

42:43.687 --> 42:46.106
Purchasing a ticket
is entering into a contract.

42:46.481 --> 42:48.984
I'd like to have a ticket,
but I don't.

42:49.442 --> 42:52.988
Your case is different: use of
public transport without a valid ticket.

42:53.488 --> 42:55.407
That's 40 Euros
and your ID details.

42:55.782 --> 42:57.576
This fun
will cost you 40 Euros.

42:59.244 --> 43:01.162
Why does he repeat
everything you say?

43:02.956 --> 43:04.749
- I don't.
- You do. The whole time!

43:04.958 --> 43:06.418
Like a little robot.

43:06.626 --> 43:08.587
- Your ID, please.
- ID!

43:08.962 --> 43:10.463
- See? Again.
- Now listen.

43:10.839 --> 43:12.382
40 Euros and your ID,

43:12.757 --> 43:15.260
or I'll call the police.
Just like that.

43:16.803 --> 43:18.388
But you won't get my ID.

43:18.805 --> 43:21.099
- Now you are repeating yourself.
- Right.

43:27.063 --> 43:28.398
So, you wanna see my ID?

43:29.774 --> 43:30.859
Dear Lord, yes!

43:31.401 --> 43:33.236
First I wanna see your IDs.

43:34.237 --> 43:36.906
We're not allowed to show them.
For security reasons.

43:37.282 --> 43:40.160
You think that's funny?
I can't even tell you my name.

43:40.869 --> 43:43.580
Isn't that hilarious?
But you may take our duty numbers.

43:43.997 --> 43:47.250
So we're clear: you want my ID
but can't show me yours.

43:47.751 --> 43:49.586
Correct.
You can have our duty numbers.

43:50.045 --> 43:52.714
Let me guess: yours is R2D2.

43:53.882 --> 43:56.635
- Watch it!
- Hey, Stefan, what's wrong today?

43:57.010 --> 43:59.262
I swear,
I'm gonna blow a fuse soon.

43:59.638 --> 44:02.599
- Everyday the same shit.
- I know, we've talked about this.

44:02.974 --> 44:03.975
Calm down.

44:07.228 --> 44:08.480
Stefan!

44:09.773 --> 44:10.815
Stop right there!

44:11.650 --> 44:13.193
Stefan, don't be stupid...

45:18.425 --> 45:20.760
- Chewing gum and vodka, please.
- One?

45:21.136 --> 45:22.220
- Pardon?
- One bottle?

45:22.429 --> 45:23.680
Two, please.

47:00.151 --> 47:01.820
We should have turned there.

47:02.445 --> 47:03.780
I know.

47:06.324 --> 47:08.576
Then why are you going straight?

47:09.410 --> 47:10.787
It's a surprise.

47:14.624 --> 47:17.085
- Yes?
- Good evening, Mrs. Baumann.

47:17.752 --> 47:19.170
Is Marcel home?

47:19.838 --> 47:20.880
I beg your pardon?

47:21.297 --> 47:22.882
Marcel?
Is he home?

47:23.758 --> 47:24.801
Yes.

47:25.593 --> 47:26.719
Who are you?

47:27.554 --> 47:28.930
We're friends of Marcel's.

47:30.348 --> 47:32.308
Could you tell
him we're here?

47:32.851 --> 47:34.853
And what do you want from Marcel?

47:35.228 --> 47:38.106
Come in. It's okay, Granny.
These are friends of mine.

47:38.857 --> 47:39.816
Come on in.

47:43.611 --> 47:44.737
Evening.

47:47.198 --> 47:49.576
So what can I do for you?
You need sneakers?

47:50.159 --> 47:53.204
- No, we need the other thing.
- Okay, how much?

47:53.580 --> 47:54.539
Two .

47:54.956 --> 47:57.834
Might take a minute,
I haven't weighed it yet.

48:03.006 --> 48:04.507
- Marcel?
- Yes?

48:05.008 --> 48:07.468
- Are your friends hungry?
- Are you hungry?

48:08.177 --> 48:10.597
- No, thank you. How about you?
- No.

48:11.222 --> 48:12.849
I could fix some sandwiches.

48:13.349 --> 48:15.602
No, Granny, that's lovely,
but maybe later?

48:17.061 --> 48:19.772
Hey, Marcel,
can I use your bathroom?

48:20.189 --> 48:23.693
- You can chop one out right here.
- I really just need the bathroom.

48:24.193 --> 48:25.778
- Opposite.
- Thanks.

49:22.669 --> 49:24.671
I'm Niko, Matze's buddy.

49:25.630 --> 49:28.049
I'm Mrs. Baumann,
Marcel's grandmother.

49:29.842 --> 49:32.303
- Are you hungry?
- No, thanks.

49:32.679 --> 49:34.097
I can fix some sandwiches.

49:34.639 --> 49:36.975
That's really kind, thank you.
I'm not hungry.

49:38.893 --> 49:40.937
That's a fancy armchair
you've got there.

49:41.270 --> 49:42.939
Marcel gave it to me.

49:43.648 --> 49:45.149
Do you want to try it?

49:45.525 --> 49:48.236
No, no, thank you,
I didn't mean to intrude.

49:53.866 --> 49:56.744
And now lean back and
make yourself comfortable.

49:57.787 --> 49:59.747
- Like this?
- Yes, just like that.

50:02.250 --> 50:03.543
What's happening now?

50:08.715 --> 50:10.216
Yeah, this is good!

50:44.667 --> 50:45.752
Niko.

50:47.587 --> 50:48.546
Niko!

50:49.505 --> 50:51.632
Are you coming
or do you wanna sleep here?

50:52.050 --> 50:53.676
- No, I'm coming.
- You can sleep here.

50:54.218 --> 50:56.179
That's very kind,
but we've got to go.

50:58.222 --> 51:00.475
Take care of yourself, Niko.

51:02.143 --> 51:03.269
I will.

51:46.104 --> 51:49.107
Hi, there should be
two tickets for Niko Fischer.

51:49.690 --> 51:50.983
You're pretty late.

51:51.984 --> 51:54.070
We couldn't find a parking space.

51:54.487 --> 51:56.656
Too bad. The performance
has already started.

51:58.533 --> 51:59.992
What's that supposed to mean?

52:01.119 --> 52:03.454
It means the performance
has already started.

52:09.127 --> 52:10.711
Can't we do anything?

52:12.547 --> 52:15.383
- Who are the tickets from?
- They're from Julika.

52:16.008 --> 52:18.803
- Julika who?
- Julika...

52:19.011 --> 52:21.222
Roly Poly Julie.

52:21.430 --> 52:22.473
Hoffmann.

52:26.769 --> 52:27.812
3rd row.

52:28.813 --> 52:31.607
Be quiet, the performance
has already started.

54:40.861 --> 54:44.156
There you are!
We almost made a toast without you!

54:44.615 --> 54:46.575
I've brought someone with me.

54:46.951 --> 54:49.120
This is Sabrina,
Kerstin and Stella.

54:49.787 --> 54:51.747
I went to boarding school
with Stella.

54:52.123 --> 54:55.084
Hey, honey, there you are.
Now, can we finally get started?

54:55.543 --> 54:57.962
I'm proud of you all. Cheers!

55:00.381 --> 55:02.925
- Friends of yours?
- Yes, these are Malte and Niko.

55:03.467 --> 55:07.305
This is Ralf, the author and
choreographer of tonight's show.

55:08.139 --> 55:10.016
Great performance.
Thank you.

55:11.100 --> 55:13.269
- So you liked it?
- Absolutely!

55:13.644 --> 55:15.771
So why did you laugh the whole time?

55:18.899 --> 55:21.652
Aren't you the guys from the third row
who came in late?

55:22.028 --> 55:24.155
- What's going on?
- You might not have heard.

55:24.572 --> 55:25.990
They laughed the whole time.

55:26.365 --> 55:28.576
- That's not true.
- Honestly, I heard it, too.

55:29.618 --> 55:32.538
I was so immersed in the role,
I didn't notice anything.

55:32.913 --> 55:35.416
I can understand
if our art is not your thing,

55:35.833 --> 55:38.753
because we don't produce
that mainstream nonsense.

55:39.337 --> 55:41.881
But why did you come here?

55:43.341 --> 55:45.092
Julika left us two tickets.

55:45.593 --> 55:46.802
- That's right.
- Really?

55:47.178 --> 55:50.973
It's getting better and better.
You get yourselves invited, you're late,

55:51.390 --> 55:53.309
you can't spare
three Euros for a ticket,

55:53.768 --> 55:56.020
then you ridicule our premiere.
That's great.

55:57.271 --> 55:59.398
Well, I hope you had
a jolly good time.

55:59.857 --> 56:01.859
Come on, we weren't that bad!

56:02.276 --> 56:06.447
In some places
I thought it was meant to be funny.

56:06.822 --> 56:07.990
Funny?

56:08.532 --> 56:11.327
Now, that I find interesting.
You'll have to explain that.

56:11.702 --> 56:13.454
What are all these strange vibes?

56:13.996 --> 56:16.540
Let's just relax
and have a little party!

56:16.957 --> 56:19.919
Wait!
What exactly did you find funny?

56:20.461 --> 56:22.922
Well, the portrayal of birth,
for instance.

56:24.131 --> 56:27.927
You have to admit that it did come
across slightly comical.

56:28.636 --> 56:30.846
Then, I have to ask myself,
seriously,

56:31.305 --> 56:34.392
why aren't we all born laughing?

56:37.228 --> 56:40.815
Why do we cry and scream?
Explain that to me!

56:41.273 --> 56:44.110
That has to do with opening
the respiratory system.

56:44.485 --> 56:46.612
- Are you a doctor?
- No, I read it somewhere.

56:46.987 --> 56:49.115
- What do you do for a living?
- Nothing.

56:49.490 --> 56:51.700
Nothing?
Yes, but it wasn't me laughing.

56:52.076 --> 56:53.702
- And you?
- I'm...

56:54.245 --> 56:56.080
currently working
in advertising.

56:56.455 --> 56:58.165
You said you're an actor.

56:59.250 --> 57:01.961
Now that's really interesting.
Let me guess.

57:02.336 --> 57:04.380
State Theater, BE, DT, Burg?

57:05.131 --> 57:07.800
Or some other government-funded
mental institution?

57:08.175 --> 57:10.428
No, not at all.
What do you do, then? Film?

57:10.845 --> 57:13.806
- Berliner Sonderschule?
- I've nothing against what you do.

57:14.181 --> 57:17.059
What's so terrible about us
trying to breathe fresh air

57:17.435 --> 57:19.603
into the off-theater scene?

57:20.187 --> 57:22.398
What you're doing here is
highly commendable!

57:22.773 --> 57:23.816
Commendable?

57:37.997 --> 57:39.874
Excuse me,
have you got a light?

57:40.916 --> 57:41.917
Thanks.

57:58.267 --> 58:00.102
Fuck off!

58:03.355 --> 58:05.357
I was afraid you'd
already gone home.

58:05.733 --> 58:07.735
I just wanted to have
a quick smoke

58:08.110 --> 58:10.112
before spoiling
the rest of your party.

58:10.488 --> 58:12.698
Rubbish.
You didn't spoil our party.

58:13.657 --> 58:16.452
- I think Ralf would disagree.
- Ah, Ralf...

58:16.911 --> 58:18.579
Ralf needs to chill out.

58:19.121 --> 58:21.916
He's always a bit sensitive
when it comes to his work.

58:22.500 --> 58:23.459
For good reason.

58:24.126 --> 58:27.046
Sometimes I'm not so excited
about what he comes up with.

58:28.172 --> 58:29.715
Why do you do it then?

58:30.633 --> 58:32.301
Because it's my hobby.

58:33.511 --> 58:35.930
And because I love standing
on that little stage

58:36.305 --> 58:38.224
knowing people are watching me.

58:38.891 --> 58:41.977
When you reveal yourself
in front of total strangers,

58:42.520 --> 58:43.979
it feels so good

58:44.188 --> 58:46.941
that I don't care
if people think it's embarrassing.

58:47.358 --> 58:48.901
I didn't find it embarrassing,

58:49.944 --> 58:50.986
I liked it.

58:52.530 --> 58:53.572
Liar.

58:53.989 --> 58:55.908
No, seriously.
I thought you were...

58:57.535 --> 58:59.703
You were courageous.

59:04.124 --> 59:06.752
Yeah, I don't know.
I wouldn't have the guts.

59:08.587 --> 59:10.548
You weren't always this cautious.

59:11.298 --> 59:13.133
What was I like then?

59:13.842 --> 59:16.220
You always seemed to know
exactly what you wanted.

59:22.768 --> 59:23.978
What is it?

59:24.603 --> 59:26.063
I don't know.

59:28.107 --> 59:29.400
You know when...

59:31.068 --> 59:35.281
You know when you get the feeling
that the people all around you

59:36.323 --> 59:38.200
are kinda strange somehow?

59:39.285 --> 59:41.954
But when you think about
it a little longer,

59:44.039 --> 59:46.834
you realize it's not the others
butyou

59:47.459 --> 59:48.711
who's the problem?

59:50.045 --> 59:51.880
Excuse me.
I didn't want to interrupt,

59:52.256 --> 59:54.258
but do you perhaps have a smoke?

59:54.633 --> 59:56.260
I don't smoke.

59:56.719 --> 59:57.720
Sure.

59:58.220 --> 59:59.221
Thanks.

59:59.638 --> 01:00:01.932
And maybe for my boys, please?

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.143
Just take some.

01:00:04.768 --> 01:00:06.937
You're a gent.
You're not from Berlin, right?

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:10.190
We are. Now we'd like
to continue our conversation.

01:00:10.608 --> 01:00:13.193
No prob, just a sec.
Come here, you dicks.

01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:15.237
I'll introduce you to Kevin,

01:00:15.613 --> 01:00:17.448
because he's got a question.

01:00:18.866 --> 01:00:20.117
Ask her, Kevin.

01:00:20.701 --> 01:00:21.952
Fuck off.

01:00:22.494 --> 01:00:24.246
Go on, don't be a pussy!

01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:30.294
I'll give you 10 Euros
if you show me your tits.

01:00:31.629 --> 01:00:32.713
Very funny.

01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:38.844
- Come on, can't you take a joke?
- That's a top offer!

01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:40.888
You frigid or what?

01:00:44.642 --> 01:00:45.851
Julika, forget it.

01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:49.146
How old are you? 17, 18?

01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:51.148
None of your business.

01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:53.108
Why don't you grow a cock

01:00:53.484 --> 01:00:55.402
before harrassing women
in the street?

01:00:57.071 --> 01:00:59.198
And what kind of guy
are you anyway?

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.203
Let me guess.

01:01:05.037 --> 01:01:06.538
You were born an alcoholic

01:01:06.872 --> 01:01:10.125
because your mom couldn't stay
off the booze during her pregnancy.

01:01:10.501 --> 01:01:13.087
How could she,
when she got beaten up by Daddy

01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:16.882
- when he came home from the pub?
- Shut your fucking trap.

01:01:17.257 --> 01:01:21.345
One day Daddy didn't come home
and then your mother blamed you.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.639
Since then
you think the world sucks.

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:26.850
And that's why
you're hanging out

01:01:27.226 --> 01:01:29.937
with your little school gang
playing leader

01:01:30.521 --> 01:01:33.899
when all you wanted was a hug.

01:01:35.984 --> 01:01:39.822
- Don't tolerate that shit, Ronny.
- Yeah, don't be toleratin', Ronny.

01:01:40.322 --> 01:01:42.282
I said shut the fuck up, whore!

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:44.201
- Whore?
- Can't we go inside?

01:01:44.618 --> 01:01:47.121
Look, there's a real whore.
She'll let you get some.

01:01:47.496 --> 01:01:49.915
If you ask nicely
she'll let you call her Mommy!

01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:53.669
- I'll shut you up, you cunt!
- Hands off, loser!

01:01:54.503 --> 01:01:55.838
You are the loser, Ronny.

01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:58.298
- I'll fuck you!
- Why don't you just go home?

01:02:02.553 --> 01:02:04.763
You're dead!
You're fucking dead, bitch!

01:02:06.098 --> 01:02:07.307
Fucking whore!

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:10.144
Those little dicks.

01:02:10.978 --> 01:02:13.063
- We should have called the police.
- Rubbish.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.232
They were only kids
looking for fun.

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:22.364
Does it hurt badly?

01:02:26.994 --> 01:02:28.954
Did I look pathetic
when I hit the floor?

01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:30.414
Not at all.

01:02:35.043 --> 01:02:36.503
Maybe a little bit.

01:02:37.171 --> 01:02:38.464
No, seriously.

01:02:38.881 --> 01:02:41.717
You intervened
and that's what counts.

01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:46.096
If you hadn't provoked them,
none of this would have happened.

01:02:46.972 --> 01:02:48.140
What do you mean?

01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:52.603
Well, you laid into them
pretty hard, eh?

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:55.564
I mean, ignore them
and they move on.

01:02:55.981 --> 01:02:57.649
Everybody knows that.

01:02:58.025 --> 01:03:00.194
Do you know how
many times in my life

01:03:00.569 --> 01:03:02.738
I've tried to ignore
what other people say?

01:03:03.906 --> 01:03:04.948
What you said?

01:03:06.158 --> 01:03:07.826
Do you have any idea how it feels

01:03:08.202 --> 01:03:10.746
to be a girl in her puberty
who weighs 180 pounds

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:13.499
and gets called names:
Roly Poly Julie

01:03:14.458 --> 01:03:16.126
and Elephant Girl and...

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:20.297
Fatty?

01:03:21.882 --> 01:03:23.550
Do you know how that feels?

01:03:24.218 --> 01:03:26.053
Of course I don't.

01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:28.972
It feels awful,

01:03:29.348 --> 01:03:32.559
and it took a really long time
for me to get over it.

01:03:32.935 --> 01:03:36.230
That's why I don't ignore
anything anymore.

01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:38.357
Not a thing.

01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:48.325
I'm sorry.

01:03:52.955 --> 01:03:53.914
Thank you.

01:04:01.088 --> 01:04:02.172
You look really great.

01:04:04.091 --> 01:04:05.092
Really?

01:04:05.843 --> 01:04:06.802
Absolutely.

01:04:07.845 --> 01:04:10.639
But deep in my heart
I'm still the same.

01:04:11.265 --> 01:04:15.143
That small, fat,
sad little girl.

01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:14.703
Do you wanna fuck
the fat little girl?

01:05:16.538 --> 01:05:18.999
Say you wanna fuck
the fat little girl.

01:05:19.666 --> 01:05:22.085
- Come on, say it.
- You mean say or...?

01:05:22.461 --> 01:05:23.420
Yes, say it.

01:05:24.171 --> 01:05:26.381
You want to fuck
the fat little girl.

01:05:27.507 --> 01:05:30.385
- I want to fuck the fat little...
- Yeah, say it!

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:34.056
I want to fuck the fat little...

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:35.807
Yes, say it louder, come on.

01:05:37.351 --> 01:05:40.270
Wait. Stop. Stop,
Julika, wait, stop, stop!

01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:42.731
What's up?

01:05:43.982 --> 01:05:46.318
I don't think
we should be doing this.

01:05:46.944 --> 01:05:47.986
Why not?

01:05:48.946 --> 01:05:50.322
Am I too fat for you?

01:05:50.822 --> 01:05:52.240
Just kidding, go on.

01:05:53.659 --> 01:05:56.745
Well, you know,
this feels kind of weird.

01:06:03.085 --> 01:06:04.920
You really think I'm too fat?

01:06:06.797 --> 01:06:07.798
What?

01:06:12.678 --> 01:06:14.012
Julika, listen.

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:18.433
All I meant was...

01:06:18.976 --> 01:06:23.313
Well, it simply feels weird.

01:06:25.524 --> 01:06:28.485
If we do this
after so many years

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:30.779
just to, you know,

01:06:33.031 --> 01:06:34.700
come to terms with the past.

01:06:35.075 --> 01:06:36.994
What?
To come to terms with the past?

01:06:39.287 --> 01:06:41.957
What a pathetic little shit
you are!

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:46.962
Why don't we go outside again
and get a drink?

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:48.755
Get your hands off me!

01:06:49.214 --> 01:06:51.299
People line up to fuck me.
So get out.

01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:53.343
I'll finish you off!

01:06:53.719 --> 01:06:56.388
Get out fast
or I'll get hysterical. Go!

01:07:03.562 --> 01:07:04.604
Julika...

01:07:05.397 --> 01:07:07.482
I said piss off!

01:07:32.049 --> 01:07:36.011
NOT EVERY COW CAN BE MILKED.

01:08:14.466 --> 01:08:16.176
Are you still serving coffee?

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:19.470
Not anymore, no.
I've cleaned the machine already.

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:22.349
All right then.
Vodka and a beer.

01:08:22.557 --> 01:08:23.558
Sure.

01:09:01.555 --> 01:09:03.515
You're a lone wolf, eh?

01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:07.185
Two more, please.

01:09:10.647 --> 01:09:12.941
I don't understand people anymore.

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:18.572
I don't understand a word they say.

01:09:20.866 --> 01:09:24.035
Listen, if you don't mind,
I'd like to be alone, okay?

01:09:25.287 --> 01:09:28.832
I don't have the faintest idea
what they're talking about.

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:34.045
Do you know what I mean?

01:09:37.674 --> 01:09:38.884
I mean...

01:09:39.426 --> 01:09:43.470
Listen, that sounds like
a different language, doesn't it?

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:48.894
They're talking German.

01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:51.020
Ah, they're talking German?

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:53.939
- Most of them, anyway.
- Well, then,

01:09:54.774 --> 01:09:57.152
I ought to understand them.

01:09:59.321 --> 01:10:02.157
I'm speaking German, too,
am I not?

01:10:02.949 --> 01:10:05.952
- As a matter of fact, yes.
- Well, actually I am.

01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:12.167
Your good health, my friend,
your good health.

01:10:25.889 --> 01:10:27.557
You're not from here, are you?

01:10:27.933 --> 01:10:30.101
Ah, what are you talking about?

01:10:30.477 --> 01:10:32.437
Of course I'm from here.

01:10:34.022 --> 01:10:36.524
I was merely away for a while.

01:10:37.525 --> 01:10:38.860
Sixty years.

01:10:39.694 --> 01:10:43.698
Back then you were just a twinkle
in a sailor's eye, weren't you?

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:52.249
- Where were you for sixty years?
- Gone.

01:11:00.966 --> 01:11:02.592
And now I'm back.

01:11:05.262 --> 01:11:06.221
I see.

01:11:07.138 --> 01:11:08.473
You see nothing.

01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:10.016
Not a thing.

01:11:11.893 --> 01:11:14.771
Back then, this all looked
a little different, my dear.

01:11:15.522 --> 01:11:18.108
My school was back there.
I was this tall.

01:11:18.817 --> 01:11:20.402
We all pissed our pants

01:11:21.653 --> 01:11:24.656
because we had to stand
at attention before class

01:11:25.031 --> 01:11:26.783
and salute the Führer:

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:29.452
Heil Hitler here,
Heil Hitler there...

01:11:30.412 --> 01:11:32.247
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Yeah, it's all right.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:37.335
You can't really imagine,
when you're that small.

01:11:38.545 --> 01:11:41.881
What you're doing.
You do what everyone does.

01:11:42.299 --> 01:11:44.926
Always this.
No, always this.

01:11:45.677 --> 01:11:47.595
Or do you beg to differ?

01:11:48.555 --> 01:11:50.265
Yeah, do you beg to differ?

01:11:50.765 --> 01:11:53.184
What do I know?
Maybe in retrospect...

01:11:53.727 --> 01:11:56.646
Yeah, of course,
in retrospect.

01:11:57.647 --> 01:12:01.276
My dear friend,
we didn't have retrospect then.

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:04.195
Retrospect.

01:12:04.696 --> 01:12:07.532
Sixty years I was gone.
I remember precisely.

01:12:08.867 --> 01:12:12.203
That parking lot
was our playground.

01:12:14.414 --> 01:12:17.667
Us rascals used
to kick a ball in the afternoons.

01:12:18.084 --> 01:12:20.795
I was the smallest,
I was always the goalie.

01:12:21.963 --> 01:12:23.048
And here...

01:12:23.423 --> 01:12:27.093
on the corner, my old man
taught me how to ride a bicycle.

01:12:27.552 --> 01:12:29.596
I'll tell you, I don't remember

01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:33.308
how many times
I fell flat on my face.

01:12:33.767 --> 01:12:36.936
But he didn't give up.
Over and over again.

01:12:37.354 --> 01:12:41.441
Until one day I was cycling
along here all alone, right?

01:12:43.902 --> 01:12:47.489
Well, maybe the bike
was a bit too big for me.

01:12:48.073 --> 01:12:50.617
Everyone on the street
always laughed a little

01:12:51.076 --> 01:12:53.620
as I rode up and down,
proud as a peacock.

01:12:56.831 --> 01:12:58.833
"Don't let them laugh at you"

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:00.960
my Dad said.

01:13:04.506 --> 01:13:05.840
But I never thought

01:13:06.383 --> 01:13:08.176
they were laughing at me.

01:13:10.595 --> 01:13:14.015
I always thought
they were happy for me.

01:13:20.772 --> 01:13:22.565
So when did you leave?

01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:26.653
Sometime
in the middle of the night,

01:13:27.028 --> 01:13:29.197
father woke me and said:

01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:35.870
"Come out to the street, my boy.
I want to show you something."

01:13:38.665 --> 01:13:41.126
And I went outwith him
onto the street.

01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:46.506
And he pressed some stones
in my hand and he said,

01:13:48.258 --> 01:13:50.844
"Now, show me what you've got."

01:13:53.888 --> 01:13:55.890
And he took a stone

01:13:58.893 --> 01:14:01.229
and smashed that window pane.

01:14:05.859 --> 01:14:07.986
Right here where we're sitting.

01:14:09.904 --> 01:14:11.823
And the street was full of people.

01:14:13.741 --> 01:14:16.202
It was pitch black.
Not bright like today,

01:14:16.578 --> 01:14:19.205
where everything glows
and sparkles

01:14:19.914 --> 01:14:23.001
because people can't bear
the dark any longer.

01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:25.003
Pitch black.

01:14:29.007 --> 01:14:33.219
And all the people on the street
smashed the windows with stones.

01:14:36.556 --> 01:14:38.850
And my father smashed that store...

01:14:40.727 --> 01:14:42.770
to bits.

01:14:45.064 --> 01:14:47.442
And I stood over there
on the street

01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:51.863
and everything was covered
in broken glass

01:14:53.114 --> 01:14:56.367
and everything was burning
and the street was sparkling

01:14:56.743 --> 01:14:58.495
because the fire was so bright.

01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:03.041
And I still remember clearly

01:15:05.376 --> 01:15:08.087
that at one point
I started to weep.

01:15:13.885 --> 01:15:15.678
NOW, guess why?

01:15:17.931 --> 01:15:18.932
Why?

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:25.897
Because I thought that,
with all the broken glass,

01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:29.359
I couldn't ride my bike anymore.

01:16:13.194 --> 01:16:15.947
- Hey, hey. ls everything all right?
- What?

01:16:16.656 --> 01:16:18.157
Are you all right?

01:16:18.866 --> 01:16:20.535
I can't understand you.

01:16:25.290 --> 01:16:27.250
Call an ambulance, please.

01:17:04.454 --> 01:17:06.998
- You can't go in.
- I wanna know what happens to him.

01:17:08.374 --> 01:17:10.126
- Are you a relative?
- No.

01:17:10.543 --> 01:17:12.503
Then please take a seat
over there.

01:17:43.618 --> 01:17:46.579
OUT OF ORDER

01:19:11.289 --> 01:19:12.915
Is he better?

01:19:14.625 --> 01:19:15.710
He died.

01:19:17.545 --> 01:19:18.713
I'm sorry.

01:19:31.768 --> 01:19:33.644
Have you contacted
his family?

01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:36.022
He doesn't have one.

01:19:40.276 --> 01:19:41.402
Nobody?

01:19:52.538 --> 01:19:54.457
Could you tell me his name?

01:19:57.502 --> 01:19:59.545
I'm not allowed to do that.

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:04.133
His first name?

01:20:09.847 --> 01:20:11.349
Friedrich.
