ROBY:
I love my job.

00:22.034 --> 00:24.000
I love it.

00:24.103 --> 00:26.241
But you do it long enough,

00:26.344 --> 00:28.689
you know, you go under that...

00:28.793 --> 00:30.827
yellow tape enough times,

00:30.931 --> 00:33.241
you find a bunch of bad answers

00:33.344 --> 00:34.931
to the big questions.

00:35.034 --> 00:36.275
What do people die for?

00:36.379 --> 00:39.275
Drugs, sex, revenge, a dollar.

00:40.724 --> 00:42.413
You know?

00:42.517 --> 00:45.172
And after a while,
I ask myself...

00:46.931 --> 00:48.724
...what is worth dying for?

00:50.034 --> 00:51.620
You know?

00:52.586 --> 00:55.241
Would I die for the truth?

01:01.241 --> 01:03.862
Would I die to find justice

01:03.965 --> 01:05.758
for someone I didn't even know?

01:05.862 --> 01:08.344
Would I put my life
on the line

01:08.448 --> 01:11.172
to make this world
a safer place?

01:11.275 --> 01:13.758
How about for love?

01:13.862 --> 01:15.448
I know this:

01:15.551 --> 01:18.551
I'd put my life on the line
for my people.

01:18.655 --> 01:21.793
The people who do this job,

01:21.896 --> 01:23.793
I love them.

01:23.896 --> 01:25.172
They are a light

01:25.275 --> 01:27.689
in the darkness.

01:27.793 --> 01:29.793
They answer the call.

01:29.896 --> 01:31.413
Well, hon, I got to go.

01:31.517 --> 01:33.793
ROBY:
They put their own lives
on hold.

01:33.896 --> 01:36.068
Sorry, Serena, it's work.

01:36.172 --> 01:37.896
ROBY:
And they risk it all.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.862
They face down the demons,

01:40.965 --> 01:43.758
wrestle those big questions.

01:43.862 --> 01:45.896
Come back the next day

01:46.000 --> 01:48.793
and do it all over again.

01:51.379 --> 01:52.965
But then, you know that. Hmm?

01:53.068 --> 01:55.758
'Cause you're one of the best
to ever do it.

01:57.758 --> 01:59.275
Oneof the best?

01:59.379 --> 02:02.413
I'm not just buttering you up.
I'm asking you, Catherine.

02:03.620 --> 02:05.482
Why do you want
to come back to CSI?

02:05.586 --> 02:07.827
I still remember the toast

02:07.931 --> 02:09.655
you gave at my retirement,

02:09.758 --> 02:12.758
asking me to submit
to a DNA test.

02:12.862 --> 02:14.275
You had a point, Max.

02:14.379 --> 02:17.793
The job is... in my blood.

02:17.896 --> 02:19.793
Guess it always will be.

02:19.896 --> 02:22.620
Hey, Gil mentioned
that you were shorthanded.

02:22.724 --> 02:26.137
Didn't help that he
stole his wife away

02:26.241 --> 02:29.620
and that one of my best is out
in L.A. training with the FBI.

02:29.724 --> 02:32.448
Put me in, Coach.How much playing
time do you want?

02:32.551 --> 02:34.689
I mean, 'cause I got
to figure the casino business

02:34.793 --> 02:36.413
keeps you pretty busy, right?It used to.

02:36.517 --> 02:39.000
I stepped away from
the day-to-day ops last year.

02:39.103 --> 02:40.586
More recently...

02:40.689 --> 02:42.758
I got kicked off the board.

02:42.862 --> 02:44.275
Of the Eclipse?

02:44.379 --> 02:46.310
Mm-hmm.Don't you own a piece of that?

02:46.413 --> 02:48.103
Yeah.I'm sorry.

02:48.206 --> 02:49.379
What happened?

02:50.344 --> 02:51.758
Well, what can I tell you?

02:51.862 --> 02:54.551
I've never gotten along
very well with criminals.

02:54.655 --> 02:57.000
I'm just not
cut out for retirement.

02:57.103 --> 02:58.379
Not yet.

02:58.482 --> 03:00.103
You know,
I kind of feel like there's

03:00.206 --> 03:02.172
something you're not telling me.

03:03.172 --> 03:05.379
You're very sharp, Max.

03:06.862 --> 03:10.586
I think we're going
to enjoy working together.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.206
[siren chirps]

03:20.137 --> 03:22.344
[loud, muffled music playing]

03:28.068 --> 03:29.827
The more things change, huh?

03:39.206 --> 03:40.655
Ms. Willows.

03:40.758 --> 03:43.517
Josh Folsom.
We've met before.

03:43.620 --> 03:46.275
It-it was my first day,
it might've been...

03:46.379 --> 03:47.827
It might've been your last.

03:47.931 --> 03:49.103
You can call me Catherine.

03:49.206 --> 03:51.137
What's her name?Lynn Zobrist.

03:51.241 --> 03:52.965
Housekeeper found her.

03:53.068 --> 03:55.551
And liver temp says
she's been dead about 36 hours.

03:55.655 --> 03:59.137
Ms. Zobrist does not
look like she was an amateur.

03:59.241 --> 04:01.344
No. Killer...

04:01.448 --> 04:03.241
was professional
grade, too.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.793
No prints on the murder weapon.

04:07.344 --> 04:09.068
ROBY:
Detective Chavez.

04:09.172 --> 04:11.275
That is not your good news face.

04:11.379 --> 04:13.689
Neighborhood canvass was a bust.

04:13.793 --> 04:15.586
There's no cameras here, either.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.344
Folks next door
didn't even

04:17.448 --> 04:18.965
know she had her
a little dungeon in her garage.

04:19.068 --> 04:22.206
Looks like one of her clients
was a very bad boy.

04:22.310 --> 04:24.172
World's oldest
occupational hazard.

04:24.275 --> 04:26.137
What's with the music?

04:26.241 --> 04:28.517
Can't turn it off.
Killer covered the speakers

04:28.620 --> 04:30.724
and the switch,
left this playing on a loop

04:30.827 --> 04:32.172
in the room where it went down.

04:32.275 --> 04:33.896
Is the dungeon back this way?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.482
Used to be.

04:35.586 --> 04:37.965
Before he dragged her
and all the furniture out.

04:38.068 --> 04:40.275
Did he leave anything in there
for us beside the soundtrack?

04:40.379 --> 04:42.379
Oh, yeah. He redecorated.

04:42.482 --> 04:44.517
He covered the
place with...

04:44.620 --> 04:46.000

ROBY:
This guy and his mirrors.

05:57.586 --> 05:59.413
A jagged hunk of glass.

05:59.517 --> 06:02.655
Wouldn't be my first choice if
I was going to stab somebody.

06:02.758 --> 06:05.275
If he was smart,
he wore thick gloves.

06:06.241 --> 06:09.620
Have to doubt this blood
from the edge was his.

06:11.103 --> 06:13.620
It's probably
from her defensive wounds.

06:13.724 --> 06:16.000
She was tough.

06:16.103 --> 06:18.758
Looks like she held him off
for a while.

06:18.862 --> 06:22.310
He must not have had
the element of surprise.

06:22.413 --> 06:25.241
And this.

06:25.344 --> 06:26.724
This had to come later.

06:26.827 --> 06:28.965
Guess he didn't want her
to see him anymore.

06:29.068 --> 06:31.103
She saw plenty.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.034
So these are just to help us see

06:35.137 --> 06:37.068
if the killer
left any fingerprints

06:37.172 --> 06:39.000
when he cleaned all those
mirrors he put up, okay, Gina?

06:39.103 --> 06:40.655
Gina.

06:40.758 --> 06:42.103
Sorry.

06:42.206 --> 06:43.620
This is...

06:43.724 --> 06:45.862
hard. Lynn
was like...

06:45.965 --> 06:48.689
She was like... Como familia.

06:49.758 --> 06:51.724
Como familia?No.

06:51.827 --> 06:53.896
No, no, I just clean for her.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.689
But I could see.

06:55.793 --> 06:57.620
She was like, always...

06:57.724 --> 07:00.103
so sad, it seemed like.

07:00.206 --> 07:01.379
About what?

07:01.482 --> 07:03.000
She had a hard life,I think.

07:03.103 --> 07:04.379
I worried for her.

07:04.482 --> 07:06.034
No family,
no friends.

07:06.137 --> 07:08.379
I think her men were the only
people who ever came over.

07:08.482 --> 07:09.724
Did she have anybody to help her

07:09.827 --> 07:11.379
with security,
background checks?

07:11.482 --> 07:13.344
No se.

07:13.448 --> 07:14.896
We-we didn't talk.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.758
Just one time,
last year.

07:16.862 --> 07:18.344
when I made her
come to Thanksgiving

07:18.448 --> 07:19.758
with me and my family.

07:21.034 --> 07:23.413
I don't know
if she liked it, but...

07:27.172 --> 07:29.379
It's okay.

07:29.482 --> 07:31.724
After that dinner,
she sponsored me.

07:31.827 --> 07:33.517
To get naturalized.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.655
See, Lynn did care.

07:36.689 --> 07:38.137
There was more to her than...

07:39.068 --> 07:41.413
Did you ever talk
to any of her clients?

07:41.517 --> 07:42.758
No.

07:42.862 --> 07:45.068
But I know what they paid
for her to do.

07:46.758 --> 07:48.517
You think one of them...

07:48.620 --> 07:50.310
Couldn't take
what she was dishing out?

07:50.413 --> 07:52.137
Maybe.

07:52.241 --> 07:53.689
I hope you find them.

07:53.793 --> 07:55.827
And give them a real punishment.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.068
Hey, Beau, he
leave any prints?

07:59.172 --> 08:01.965
None that we can reach.
Can't get in there. I mean,

08:02.068 --> 08:03.620
my wife's got me trying keto,
but I don't think I'm ready

08:03.724 --> 08:05.344
to moonwalk across
a mirrored floor like this.

08:05.448 --> 08:08.448
Catherine Willows.
I don't believe we've met.Uh, I'm

08:08.551 --> 08:10.551
Beau Finado.
You can call me Beau.

08:10.655 --> 08:12.620
Or Finado.

08:12.724 --> 08:14.827
Or Beau Finado.

08:14.931 --> 08:16.241
Because that's your name?

08:16.344 --> 08:17.448
Mm-hmm.

08:17.551 --> 08:19.586
What happened to the music?

08:19.689 --> 08:21.517
Oh, I found the power box.

08:21.620 --> 08:24.344
Cut the power in here. I just...
I didn't want to fry myself.

08:24.448 --> 08:26.068
He sure made
it sparkle.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.517
212 mirrors.

08:27.620 --> 08:29.482
Took out the frames,
cut 'em to size.

08:29.586 --> 08:32.068
Had to take some time.
It's risky.

08:32.172 --> 08:34.344
[sighs]
What's it all supposed to mean?

08:34.448 --> 08:36.482
You try to make perfect sense
out of something insane,

08:36.586 --> 08:38.448
you might go crazy, too.

08:38.551 --> 08:41.310
Let's hope he didn't
clean up underneath.

08:41.413 --> 08:42.758
Yeah, we'll know soon.

08:42.862 --> 08:44.724
I figured out how
to get rid of the mirrors

08:44.827 --> 08:46.689
without breaking them,
without ripping the evidence up.

08:46.793 --> 08:48.275
Just... You got to
overheat the glue

08:48.379 --> 08:49.758
that he used to set them in.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.655
Hold up, aren't you
worried about...

08:51.758 --> 08:52.931
Cooking the blood?Yeah.

08:53.034 --> 08:55.241
Fear not.
I set the temperature to 593

08:55.344 --> 08:57.931
degrees Fahrenheit. Blood
proteins-- they can hold

08:58.034 --> 09:00.413
up to 600 degrees, right?
But most industrial adhesives

09:00.517 --> 09:04.241
experience molecular breakdown
just north of 590 degrees.

09:10.137 --> 09:12.137
You get this great little window
you can operate in.

09:12.241 --> 09:14.137
Beau's a clever one.
He ran R and D

09:14.241 --> 09:17.517
for a few of different
Fortune 500 chemical companies.

09:17.620 --> 09:19.275
What, are you allergic to money?

09:19.379 --> 09:21.965
What happened?The pandemic happened.

09:23.482 --> 09:25.965
After the lockdown, I just...
I didn't want to go back

09:26.068 --> 09:29.344
to some lab making
sticky stuff stickier or

09:29.448 --> 09:30.413
smooth things...

09:30.517 --> 09:31.655
Less sticky?Yeah. I think

09:31.758 --> 09:34.655
I made this less sticky.

09:37.758 --> 09:40.827
Now, this is beautiful.

09:40.931 --> 09:42.620
You get all these up,
we might be looking

09:42.724 --> 09:44.551
at an intact crime scene.

09:44.655 --> 09:47.000
♪ ♪

09:57.689 --> 10:01.137
PARK:
Two entire racks
of DNA samples

10:01.241 --> 10:02.689
from one scene?

10:02.793 --> 10:04.034
From part of one scene, Chris.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.586
They're not even
halfway done out there.

10:05.689 --> 10:07.689
Think this new guy
might be a tad overzealous?

10:07.793 --> 10:10.000
[chuckles]
Beau's extremely overzealous.

10:10.103 --> 10:12.931
But Max wants
every square inch charted.

10:13.034 --> 10:15.413
Killer was nice enough to
spare the bleach, he just

10:15.517 --> 10:17.586
covered his mess.Well,

10:17.689 --> 10:19.448
no better place
to find a big mess of DNA

10:19.551 --> 10:21.620
than a sex dungeon.

10:21.724 --> 10:23.137
I'd assume.

10:23.241 --> 10:25.344
You find the spot
where she was killed?

10:25.448 --> 10:27.137
Not yet. Beau's gonna

10:27.241 --> 10:29.034
follow the blood trail
to the source.

10:29.137 --> 10:30.448
I heard a rumor

10:30.551 --> 10:32.482
that Catherine Willows is back.

10:32.586 --> 10:35.310
She might be coming on
as a consultant.

10:35.413 --> 10:37.000
Yeah.Whoa.

10:37.103 --> 10:38.724
That's wild.

10:38.827 --> 10:40.413
Were you surprised when Michael
Jordan stopped playing baseball

10:40.517 --> 10:41.827
and came back to the Bulls?No.

10:41.931 --> 10:44.793
But then again,
I was two years old.

10:44.896 --> 10:46.689
[scoffs]I wonder

10:46.793 --> 10:48.379
if she talked to, uh,
Sara and Grissom.

10:48.482 --> 10:50.241
Got the scoop on the new folks.

10:50.344 --> 10:52.965
They're on a boat above
the Arctic Circle so, yeah,

10:53.068 --> 10:54.862
she probably dialed 'em up

10:54.965 --> 10:57.137
on a sat phone,
asked all about you, Chris.

10:57.241 --> 11:00.068
This new girlfriend of yours--
does she think you're funny?

11:01.551 --> 11:04.551
ROBY:Hey, Penny. I can
always come back

11:04.655 --> 11:06.655
if this is a private moment.

11:06.758 --> 11:08.655
Oh, no. I just fell
down a rabbit hole

11:08.758 --> 11:10.551
looking at Lynn's
follows on Instagram.

11:10.655 --> 11:11.862
I was looking through her phone.

11:11.965 --> 11:13.310
I did find
some interesting suspects.

11:13.413 --> 11:15.827
You find out who she was
entertaining the day she died?

11:15.931 --> 11:17.793
No, that I don't know.

11:17.896 --> 11:19.172
Lynn wasn't much
of a bookkeeper.

11:19.275 --> 11:21.034
But the day before
she died she did talk

11:21.137 --> 11:25.034
to a wuss, a yapper,
a dink and a pud.

11:25.137 --> 11:27.413
Not a lot of terms of endearment
in Lynn's contacts.

11:27.517 --> 11:30.379
The milk of human kindness was
not what these guys were after.

11:31.413 --> 11:32.724
You know, about BDSM...

11:32.827 --> 11:34.862
Hmm?I'm a little
embarrassed to admit,

11:34.965 --> 11:36.931
but it's never appealed to me.

11:37.034 --> 11:39.000
I love your generation.

11:39.793 --> 11:41.517
So this is what embarrasses you?

11:41.620 --> 11:43.931
Sometimes people, like,

11:44.034 --> 11:45.689
spend a lot of energy
holding it all together,

11:45.793 --> 11:48.172
So they need someone else
to take control.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.344
No, I mean,
I get it in theory.

11:50.448 --> 11:52.862
I don't know, maybe when
I'm a boss, I'll be into it.

11:52.965 --> 11:55.103
Okay.Not that all bosses
are into it.

11:55.206 --> 11:57.862
I mean...Okay, we're gonna
leave it right there.

11:57.965 --> 11:59.482
But I guarantee you
most of these guys

11:59.586 --> 12:01.103
are heartsick right now.

12:01.206 --> 12:04.206
I mean, the work she did--
some people needed it that way.

12:04.310 --> 12:06.344
One of them ruined it
for the rest of them.Call them all.

12:06.448 --> 12:07.689

12:07.793 --> 12:09.103

goes to the top of my list.

12:19.517 --> 12:20.965
Oh, yeah.

12:21.068 --> 12:24.241
Yeah, I'm just trying to
figure out who went where and...

12:24.344 --> 12:25.965
Any of her guests that
left a trace of themselves

12:26.068 --> 12:28.137
near her blood trail
is worth an extra look.

12:28.241 --> 12:29.896
Yeah, looks like
you're gonna be busy.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.482
Yeah, lot of
overlapping evidence.

12:32.586 --> 12:36.379
We found skin oils,
blood, some semen from

12:36.482 --> 12:37.965
various clients.

12:38.068 --> 12:40.275
And Beau's still prying
all the mirrors down,

12:40.379 --> 12:41.931
so I figured I'd start
with the furniture

12:42.034 --> 12:43.689
that got dragged out
into the hall.

12:43.793 --> 12:45.000
I can tell where some of it went

12:45.103 --> 12:46.965
from the indentations
in the carpet.

12:47.068 --> 12:48.793
It's just so much
to keep track of.

12:48.896 --> 12:51.448
Lots of iterations,
explanations.

12:51.551 --> 12:52.862

12:52.965 --> 12:55.758
thought about
molecular mapmaking?

I mean, I've heard of it.
It's pretty new.

12:57.413 --> 12:59.206

13:01.275 --> 13:02.827
No, I'm not trained in MMM, I...

13:02.931 --> 13:04.931

try to stay current.

13:05.034 --> 13:07.724

in careers

13:12.413 --> 13:13.724

20:32.137 --> 20:34.000
who left DNA
near the blood stains.

20:34.103 --> 20:36.724
But there's one woman in
particular we're gonna talk to.

20:36.827 --> 20:39.103
A female client?Not a client.

20:39.206 --> 20:41.517
A female psychiatrist.

20:41.620 --> 20:43.931
She was in Lynn's phone.

20:44.034 --> 20:47.310
So, you work with a lot of kids
in your practice?

20:47.413 --> 20:50.172
She had me in her
phone as Yapper?

20:50.275 --> 20:52.482
[chuckles]
Guess we did do

20:52.586 --> 20:54.862
a lot talking, sh...
Lynn was my patient

20:54.965 --> 20:56.827
off and on since she was...

20:56.931 --> 20:58.275
gosh, ten?

20:58.379 --> 20:59.862
Since doctor-patient
no longer applies,

20:59.965 --> 21:01.724
I'm hoping you can tell me
what you guys talked about

21:01.827 --> 21:02.724
the day she died.

21:02.827 --> 21:04.310
Any

21:04.413 --> 21:06.206
threats, fears,

21:06.310 --> 21:08.344
problems with men.

21:08.448 --> 21:09.931
Nah, she just wanted
to restart therapy.

21:10.034 --> 21:11.551
We didn't get into why.

21:11.655 --> 21:13.517
But Lynn had

21:13.620 --> 21:15.931
experienced a lot of abuse
as a child,

21:16.034 --> 21:17.586
and she struggled

21:17.689 --> 21:19.689
with violent ideation.

21:19.793 --> 21:22.103
You know
she went past ideas, right?

21:23.000 --> 21:24.758
She was whipping dudes
with a belt on the reg.

21:24.862 --> 21:25.793
I did worry

21:25.896 --> 21:28.724
that BDSM was the wrong career.

21:28.827 --> 21:30.137
Temptations.

21:30.241 --> 21:33.000
But she did say that

21:33.103 --> 21:34.689
it was like a-a release valve.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.413
One reason I'm here.

21:36.517 --> 21:38.379
We want to know about something
that happened five years ago.

21:38.482 --> 21:40.896
Lynn was hurt on the job.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.448
She lost a lot of blood.

21:43.551 --> 21:45.413
You know what happened there?Oh, no.

21:45.517 --> 21:48.517
You're confused.
Those-those scars are old.

21:49.965 --> 21:51.310
That's from ECT.

21:51.413 --> 21:53.068
Electroconvulsive therapy.

21:53.172 --> 21:54.517
Like electroshock?

21:55.379 --> 21:56.689
I didn't think
that was done anymore.

21:56.793 --> 21:59.275
It's not.
ECT is more mild.

21:59.379 --> 22:01.413
But Lynn had a

22:01.517 --> 22:03.137
previous physician

22:03.241 --> 22:05.517
named Dr. Sarkisian.

22:06.586 --> 22:08.000
You-you can really burn someone

22:08.103 --> 22:10.931
with those electrodes,
you know, if you're not careful.

22:11.034 --> 22:12.448
So, she was getting
abused at home

22:12.551 --> 22:13.896
and then she got zapped
by her doctor.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.241
No surprise she had
an attachment disorder.

22:16.344 --> 22:18.448
And major trust issues.

22:18.551 --> 22:19.724
Which is why
I couldn't persuade her

22:19.827 --> 22:22.586
to go to the cops
five years ago.

22:22.689 --> 22:24.896
So you know who hurt her?Yeah, Miguel Sanchez.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.620
But he's not the guy
you're looking for.

22:26.724 --> 22:28.068
I think I'll be
the judge of that.

22:28.172 --> 22:29.206
Well, he died.

22:29.310 --> 22:30.689
Cancer.

22:30.793 --> 22:32.586
The only time
I ever saw Lynn smile

22:32.689 --> 22:34.655
was when she showed me his obit.

22:34.758 --> 22:36.344
Can I ask you
one question?

22:36.448 --> 22:37.965
The killer--

22:38.068 --> 22:39.344
what did he do to her?

22:39.448 --> 22:41.275
Certain details we can't share.

22:41.379 --> 22:43.413
Yeah, yeah.

22:44.448 --> 22:45.896
I am curious, though.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.344
Did, uh, did mirrors have
any special meaning to Lynn?

22:50.655 --> 22:52.068
The scene was covered in them.

22:52.172 --> 22:53.482
I don't recall there being

22:53.586 --> 22:55.379
any special iconography

22:55.482 --> 22:58.172
having to do with mirrors
in our work together.

22:58.275 --> 22:59.068
Really?

22:59.172 --> 23:00.310
'Cause you look like

23:00.413 --> 23:02.862
something's bothering you.It is.

23:02.965 --> 23:04.206
A killer

23:04.310 --> 23:07.448
who decorated
the scene of the crime that way.

23:07.551 --> 23:09.344
I bet he kills again.

23:11.482 --> 23:12.862
Ah...

23:12.965 --> 23:14.793
[laughing]

23:14.896 --> 23:17.724
You know, Lynn would
laugh at both of you.

23:18.724 --> 23:21.206
I mean, I wasn't even
allowed to touch her.

23:21.310 --> 23:23.379
It was against
the rules.

23:23.482 --> 23:25.310
You know that murder is, too,
so...

23:25.413 --> 23:26.655
Somebody broke some rules.

23:26.758 --> 23:27.827
MAN:
I never would.

23:27.931 --> 23:29.482
Mistress was...

23:31.103 --> 23:32.758
I loved her.

23:32.862 --> 23:34.965
I need to see your hands.
Arms, too.

23:38.137 --> 23:39.827
I'm a very clean boy.

23:39.931 --> 23:42.379
But I do have
a confession to make.

23:43.862 --> 23:44.896
Go ahead.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.413
This is so hot.

23:46.517 --> 23:48.241
This room--
you two--

23:48.344 --> 23:49.827
the whole dynamic.

23:49.931 --> 23:51.413
WILLOWS:
All right, let's just

23:51.517 --> 23:53.172
keep our hands on the table.

23:53.275 --> 23:55.482
Yes, ma'am.

23:55.586 --> 23:56.965
ROBY:
Where did you get that?

23:57.793 --> 23:59.896
Building a tree house
with my son.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.275
Sure it wasn't
from the edge of a mirror?

24:02.379 --> 24:04.862
I was at home with my family
when you say this happened.

24:08.275 --> 24:10.172
You keep checking yourself
out in our mirror.

24:10.275 --> 24:11.793
You do know there's
a camera behind it,

24:11.896 --> 24:13.517
recording everything
that goes on here.

24:13.620 --> 24:14.551
MAN 2:
Feels weird knowing that.

24:14.655 --> 24:16.827
Maybe good weird.

24:16.931 --> 24:18.896
This isn't a fantasy,
Mr. Vizquel.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.275
[laughs]: Sorry.
It's just...

24:20.379 --> 24:21.689
[coughs]

24:21.793 --> 24:23.793
You're probing me,
asking to see my body.

24:23.896 --> 24:25.068
To see if Ms. Zobrist
injured you

24:25.172 --> 24:26.793
when she was fighting
for her life.

24:26.896 --> 24:29.793
Someone left their DNA
near Ms. Zobrist's blood trail.

24:29.896 --> 24:31.448
And the sample we got from you

24:31.551 --> 24:33.137
is to determine if it's yours.

24:33.241 --> 24:34.758
Would that be surprising?

24:34.862 --> 24:36.965
I'm-I'm really not
trying to be difficult.

24:37.068 --> 24:40.793
As I said, Z-- she hosted
me there, several times.

24:40.896 --> 24:43.310
You kept coming back for more.
Did it get to be too much?

24:43.413 --> 24:45.103
No.

24:45.206 --> 24:47.620
No, Lynn made me feel
like I was normal.

24:47.724 --> 24:50.551
I'm not sure there's
any such thing as normal

24:50.655 --> 24:52.551
or that I'm it, but...

24:52.655 --> 24:54.655
it's what I need to believe.

24:54.758 --> 24:56.793
We all need that.

24:56.896 --> 24:57.965
Right?

24:58.068 --> 25:00.517
Nobody's here to judge,
Mr. Herskovitz.

25:00.620 --> 25:03.655
Our job is to get justice
for that woman.

25:03.758 --> 25:06.000
It doesn't matter to me
what she did with her friends.

25:06.103 --> 25:08.206
What matters to me
is what he did.

25:08.310 --> 25:10.068
We're gonna find him.

25:10.172 --> 25:13.206
If you do,
I'll be grateful.

25:18.482 --> 25:20.862
Clean arms,
no one resisted sampling.

25:20.965 --> 25:23.103
Assuming
all their alibis check out.

25:23.206 --> 25:25.206
We're gonna need
some more suspects.

25:25.310 --> 25:27.172
Yep.

25:28.379 --> 25:30.103
Okay, if it
was up to me,

25:30.206 --> 25:33.413
I would put the old
rack right... there.

25:33.517 --> 25:34.862
Nobody puts baby in the corner.

25:34.965 --> 25:36.827
He's got to be out on display.

25:36.931 --> 25:37.793
How about...

25:37.896 --> 25:39.793
here?Okay, since

25:39.896 --> 25:41.724
neither of us can figure out
where the furniture went

25:41.827 --> 25:43.413
in Lynn's sex dungeon,

25:43.517 --> 25:46.793
I don't think either of us would
ever make it as a dominatrix.

25:46.896 --> 25:48.517
[laughs]

25:48.620 --> 25:50.896
Then again,
you're full of surprises.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.206
What?

25:54.482 --> 25:56.448
Detective Chavez.

25:56.551 --> 25:59.241
How long has that been?
When did you...

25:59.344 --> 26:00.862
Uh, about two months.

26:00.965 --> 26:03.724
T... Josh, we've talked
a dozen times since then.

26:03.827 --> 26:05.241
Yeah, I should've
mentioned it, just...

26:05.344 --> 26:08.896
Me and Serena, it's...
it was-it was casual and then...

26:09.000 --> 26:11.206
What, it's more now, is it?

26:12.379 --> 26:14.482
Hey.Hey.

26:14.586 --> 26:16.793
Do you have any more
kinky gentlemen we can talk to?

26:16.896 --> 26:19.137
We just went oh-fer with
our domme's last three bookings.

26:19.241 --> 26:21.068
Ms. Willows.
I'm Allie Rajan.Yes.

26:21.172 --> 26:23.517
Hello.Some women
with the Bureau in L.A.

26:23.620 --> 26:25.137
have some very nice things
to say about you.

26:25.241 --> 26:27.344
Oh, well, they have to.
I hired them all.

26:27.448 --> 26:29.137
You must be the friend
he was gonna call.

26:29.241 --> 26:31.793
I see you got
a molecular map here.Most of one.

26:31.896 --> 26:33.827
Once Max parsed
which blood

26:33.931 --> 26:35.448
was new and which
was pre-existent,

26:35.551 --> 26:37.862
made it clear where Ms. Zobrist
fell and bled this time.

26:37.965 --> 26:40.655
Gives us the full blood trail,
but we're still staring

26:40.758 --> 26:43.206
at a dozen guys square dancing
around this dungeon.

26:43.310 --> 26:45.241
The last thingto do is

26:45.344 --> 26:46.551
place all the furniture.

26:46.655 --> 26:48.586
Kind of like...
kind of like Tetris,

26:48.689 --> 26:49.862
if you want to
try your hand.

26:49.965 --> 26:52.758
Mm, not much
into interior design.

26:52.862 --> 26:55.551
Blood evidence is where I'm at.

26:55.655 --> 26:58.310
It always tells a story.

26:58.413 --> 27:00.241
This one's got a strange twist.

27:00.344 --> 27:02.310
The blood trail.

27:02.413 --> 27:04.931
A crescent shape-- is
that really so strange?

27:05.034 --> 27:07.275
Ever drag a body?
It's not fun.

27:07.379 --> 27:08.758
I mean, there's no reason

27:08.862 --> 27:10.103
he would haul her
all the way over here

27:10.206 --> 27:12.000
if he was always
headed out the door.

27:12.103 --> 27:14.724
Unless he was steering
around something.

27:14.827 --> 27:16.103
WILLOWS:
What was sitting there?

27:16.206 --> 27:17.827
Did anything
in that pile of furniture

27:17.931 --> 27:19.137
fit these indentations?

27:19.241 --> 27:21.827
Not exactly,
but some of her...

27:21.931 --> 27:24.965
apparatus-- I-I thought
maybe she moved it around.

27:25.068 --> 27:27.827
You know, different dents
made different days.

27:27.931 --> 27:30.206
I don't think that's it.

27:30.310 --> 27:32.655
I mean, this man took
special care dressing his scene.

27:32.758 --> 27:35.068
There's a lot
that he wanted us to see.

27:35.172 --> 27:37.655
But whatever was sitting there,

27:37.758 --> 27:39.586
I bet it's missing
because it would have

27:39.689 --> 27:41.034
shown us exactly who he is.

27:45.620 --> 27:48.655
It's hard to know what belongs
in a dominatrix's backyard.

27:48.758 --> 27:50.103
This is my first time.

27:50.206 --> 27:51.620
Hey, Folsom.

27:51.724 --> 27:54.000
Yeah?

27:56.034 --> 27:58.103
That's not all firewood.

27:58.206 --> 28:01.068
No, it's furniture, or it was.

28:01.172 --> 28:03.655
I don't know,
some kind of antique.

28:03.758 --> 28:06.241
Sawhorse, a pommel, maybe?

28:06.344 --> 28:08.172
It's chopped up
and burned to hell.

28:11.275 --> 28:14.482
Fits. Filigree on the feet
has that dungeon vibe.

28:14.586 --> 28:16.551
Wonder what this thing
ever did to our killer.

28:16.655 --> 28:19.655
Lord knows, but he sure
was worried we'd find it.

28:19.758 --> 28:22.896
If she nicked him
and he bumped against it,

28:23.000 --> 28:24.551
maybe there'd be trace, DNA.

28:24.655 --> 28:27.413
We've measured everything
in that house.

28:27.517 --> 28:29.482
There's nothing in there that
left those marks on the carpet.

28:29.586 --> 28:31.517
Have you considered
the possibility that maybe...

28:31.620 --> 28:33.655
Dude. They found it.

28:33.758 --> 28:35.965
Yeah, well,
whatever it was...

28:37.413 --> 28:39.689
...it's of no use now.GILL: Oh, I don't know.

28:39.793 --> 28:41.724
I bet Beau can make something
with that.

28:41.827 --> 28:43.482
Does Beau have a time machine?

28:43.586 --> 28:45.172
Kind of.

28:46.724 --> 28:49.068
♪ ♪

29:13.724 --> 29:17.034
Probably not the first time
a thin layer of latex

29:17.137 --> 29:19.275
has come in handy
with this pommel horse, huh?

29:19.379 --> 29:20.793
Is that what you think this is?

29:20.896 --> 29:22.241
Well, pretty sure, yeah.

29:22.344 --> 29:24.379
You know, for the...

I'm back.

FINADO:
That looks like blood,
doesn't it?

29:40.862 --> 29:42.137
ROBY:
We can try PCR,

29:42.241 --> 29:44.034
hope for DNA.
But I'm gonna doubt it.

29:44.137 --> 29:45.689
Fire probably got too hot.

29:45.793 --> 29:46.655
What is that?

29:46.758 --> 29:48.379
Well, it appears to be...

29:48.482 --> 29:50.344
dark goo.

29:50.448 --> 29:52.862
I'm good, but I'm not
a mass spectrometer, all right?

29:52.965 --> 29:55.379
ROBY: That's all right, Beau.Yep.

40:49.482 --> 40:51.517
Grace was a dancer like I was.

40:51.620 --> 40:54.241
She started taking classes
at WLVU,

40:54.344 --> 40:57.000
which is how we met.

40:57.103 --> 40:59.000
You get to know
these young women,

40:59.103 --> 41:01.862
and you can't help
but get involved and...

41:02.655 --> 41:04.620
Yeah, Grace,
she's just so passionate

41:04.724 --> 41:07.206
about becoming a CSI.

41:07.310 --> 41:09.137
But she's new to Vegas.

41:09.241 --> 41:12.517
No money, so I got her a job
at the Eclipse.

41:12.620 --> 41:15.275
Cocktail waitressing.
Decent hours.

41:15.379 --> 41:18.344
And her grades took off.

41:18.448 --> 41:20.551
Max,

41:20.655 --> 41:23.413
you would love this girl.

41:23.517 --> 41:25.620

♪ Progress is inescapable... ♪

41:30.862 --> 41:33.551
Grace has been missing
for three weeks.

41:33.655 --> 41:37.379
I am so sorry.There's no investigation.

41:37.482 --> 41:40.068
That is why I'm here.

41:40.172 --> 41:41.379
What do you mean?

41:41.482 --> 41:44.724
Max, I asked a lot of people
where Grace was.

41:44.827 --> 41:47.034
Nobody knew.

41:48.103 --> 41:50.206
Nobody-- nobody at the Eclipse

41:50.310 --> 41:52.758
even seemed to care.

41:52.862 --> 41:55.827
With no warning,
the board calls a vote,

41:55.931 --> 41:57.827
and I get kicked off.

41:57.931 --> 41:59.517
ROBY:
Why?

41:59.620 --> 42:02.241
WILLOWS:
I don't know. That's the truth.

42:02.344 --> 42:06.000
I really have no idea
what they're covering up.
