WEBVTT

00:03.871 --> 00:09.777
[theme music]

00:46.880 --> 00:54.855
[laugh]

00:54.888 --> 00:56.824
So I'm going to drop you
off at your game a little bit

00:56.857 --> 00:59.727
early, and then if Becky ever
finishes the living room,

00:59.760 --> 01:02.430
we'll all go down to the Budget
Club and I'll get your sneakers

01:02.463 --> 01:04.898
and I'll pick up the
tire for the car.

01:04.932 --> 01:07.034
Your game ought to
be finished by then.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.870
Then alls I'll have left to
do is go in for my bikini wax.

01:12.940 --> 01:14.041
Give me my paper.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.176
What are you doing?

01:15.209 --> 01:17.678
I am running this house
with no help from you.

01:17.711 --> 01:20.281
And doing a hell of a job.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.815
All right, what do
you want me to do?

01:21.849 --> 01:23.584
You weren't even listening.

01:23.617 --> 01:24.518
Yeah, I was.

01:24.552 --> 01:25.853
What'd I say?

01:25.886 --> 01:28.456
I don't know, something about
turtle waxing your bikini.

01:28.489 --> 01:29.757
[buzz sound]

01:29.790 --> 01:31.625
I'm sorry, Mr. Connor, I
guess that handsome dinette

01:31.659 --> 01:35.363
set will have to go to
our returning chamption.

01:35.396 --> 01:36.997
Why can't we do
all this on Sunday?

01:37.030 --> 01:39.900
Because there's a game on
Sunday your mom wants to watch.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.703
Yeah.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.538
Becky, plate.

01:44.572 --> 01:47.475
Honey, feeling a little tense?

01:47.508 --> 01:48.576
Irritable?

01:48.609 --> 01:50.444
Peckish?

01:50.478 --> 01:53.214
Maybe it's your hair color.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.448
Maybe it's my job.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.016
Maybe you should
quit that job.

01:56.049 --> 01:57.418
And do what?

01:57.451 --> 01:59.520
All the power jobs are taken.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.522
Margaret's running
England, Vanna's

02:01.555 --> 02:04.492
turning the letters
over, and Delta

02:04.525 --> 02:06.427
Burke has her own damn TV show.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.864
Are you going to
be late tonight?

02:10.898 --> 02:12.266
No.

02:12.300 --> 02:15.102
I only got a half day's worth
of finishing work to do.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.037
Well, I got to go, because
I got a staff meeting

02:17.070 --> 02:19.407
and my boss freaks
out if anybody's late.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.474
You mind getting dinner tonight?

02:25.179 --> 02:26.714
OK.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.416
Yeah.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.318
What do I gotta do?

02:30.351 --> 02:34.021
Well you stand up, and then
you go over here and take

02:34.054 --> 02:36.257
the stuff out of this cold box.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.392
Brr!

02:38.426 --> 02:40.694
And then you trot it
right over and you

02:40.728 --> 02:42.330
stick it in this hot box.

02:47.501 --> 02:48.869
What was that
middle part again?

02:57.211 --> 02:59.680
And another thing.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.415
Uniforms.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.484
Starch those apron bows, ladies.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.186
Wash them every day and
get your moms to iron them.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.522
Oh, I have a question.

03:08.556 --> 03:12.660
What if your mom has really bad
rheumatoid arthritis, you know?

03:12.693 --> 03:15.296
And, uh, say she's like
living on the other side

03:15.329 --> 03:17.197
the International
Date Line, you know.

03:17.231 --> 03:20.167
Then should you like,
get your kids to do it?

03:20.200 --> 03:22.303
I don't care like who does it.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.572
But we've got to start
looking like professionals,

03:24.605 --> 03:26.540
or no one's going to
take us seriously.

03:26.574 --> 03:27.541
Um.

03:27.575 --> 03:30.578
The beak keeps
falling off my apron.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.280
And let's perk
up the customers,

03:32.313 --> 03:33.914
all right, they eat more.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.783
They eat more.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.758
He's taking notes.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.794
Since I thought of having
the feedback box put in--

03:46.827 --> 03:48.161
Yeah?

03:48.195 --> 03:51.131
--gotten a lot of disturbing
complaints about the fries.

03:51.164 --> 03:52.833
Oily, and no taste.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.268
Oh, no, that was
about the owners.

03:58.972 --> 04:02.543
So far the biggest
complaint we've had is speed.

04:02.576 --> 04:06.380
People waiting five,
six minutes for orders.

04:06.414 --> 04:08.482
Now, this is supposed
to be fast food, people,

04:08.516 --> 04:09.683
and we can't exactly
call it fast.

04:09.717 --> 04:10.584
Why not?

04:10.618 --> 04:11.552
We call it food.

04:15.823 --> 04:16.624
Look.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.129
The bottom line here
is that some of you

04:22.162 --> 04:26.099
are just not
playing to capacity.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.736
Which means I've had
to do some platooning

04:28.769 --> 04:31.639
and juggle the schedule a bit.

04:31.672 --> 04:35.776
So Jay, Wednesdays and
Fridays, you're on nights.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.177
Come on, Brian.

04:37.210 --> 04:41.615
All right, Andrew and Debbie,
Mondays and Thursdays you open.

04:41.649 --> 04:44.217
I uh, I do have a big
math test on Monday,

04:44.251 --> 04:47.655
but I will be here.

04:47.688 --> 04:50.558
Roseanne you're
off on Wednesday,

04:50.591 --> 04:52.660
but you're here on Saturday.

04:52.693 --> 04:53.561
OK, that's it.

04:53.594 --> 04:54.462
Let's open.

04:54.495 --> 04:57.030
Now remember, perky.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.600
Um, Brian, remember?

04:59.633 --> 05:01.134
We had this discussion.

05:01.168 --> 05:04.037
I can't work on weekends,
because I have a family.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.606
Well, this is a family, too.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.174
Yeah, but it ain't my family.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.543
Look, Roseanne, weekends
are what it's all about.

05:09.577 --> 05:10.878
And I need somebody fast.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.446
Well, I could be flexible.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.549
I could slow down.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.751
Look, I'm going to tell you
something right now, all right.

05:17.785 --> 05:20.388
That negative attitude of yours,
it's going to get you nowhere.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.856
This is nowhere.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.392
I don't like working
weekends either, but--

05:24.425 --> 05:26.860
I know, and that's
why you never do.

05:26.894 --> 05:29.530
You just sit up there in your
office like a little chicken

05:29.563 --> 05:31.532
Napoleon, making your
little chicken schedules

05:31.565 --> 05:32.966
to screw up everybody's life.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.870
I told you in the beginning,
I was not working weekends.

05:36.904 --> 05:38.639
You are paid to
follow my orders.

05:42.309 --> 05:45.045
Now, it isn't always
pretty, but this

05:45.078 --> 05:47.515
is the business we've chosen.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.517
You got a big booger
hanging out of your nose.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.194
This moisturizer any good?

06:01.228 --> 06:03.196
Everything I got is good.

06:03.230 --> 06:04.998
It's one of my big sellers.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.200
Hey, you know, I'm going to
ask for a second district.

06:07.234 --> 06:08.101
Really?

06:08.135 --> 06:09.202
That's great.

06:09.236 --> 06:13.073
Oh, Roseanne, I like
this Prussian blue.

06:13.106 --> 06:16.343
Oh, yeah, that will look
great with your cop uniform.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.679
Roseanne, did I
tell you my TO let

06:18.712 --> 06:20.848
me take the collar on a DWI.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.884
N-O.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.153
They usually don't let
rookies take the collar.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.054
Really?

06:27.087 --> 06:28.121
Yeah.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.023
That's great.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.358
How 'bout you, Roseanne?

06:31.391 --> 06:32.693
How's your job going?

06:32.726 --> 06:35.395
Sometimes I wish I was still
back at Wellman, I swear.

06:35.429 --> 06:37.898
Bite your tongue.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.333
And now he's going to
make me work weekends.

06:40.367 --> 06:41.602
You're kidding.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.537
Have you talked to him
and told him how you feel?

06:46.840 --> 06:49.943
Well, of course you have.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.812
Roseanne, you
should quit that job.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.747
And do what, go
back into medicine.

06:53.781 --> 06:54.882
Yeah, I'm serious.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.349
Have you really
tried talking to him?

06:56.383 --> 06:58.886
You know, butter him up,
turn on the old charm.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.522
Hey, I'm not kissing up
to some dweeby little kid

07:01.555 --> 07:03.323
just because he holds
my life in his hands.

07:03.356 --> 07:04.792
You don't have
to kiss up to him,

07:04.825 --> 07:06.226
just treat him a little better.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.327
You know how to do it.

07:07.360 --> 07:11.465
Yeah, like not calling
him the little maggot.

07:11.499 --> 07:13.166
Believe me,
Roseanne, I wouldn't

07:13.200 --> 07:16.036
be where I am today if I didn't
know how to handle people.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.005
Truth is, Roseanne,
you could use some work

07:18.038 --> 07:20.407
on your interpersonal
relationships.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.309
Stick it.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.978
She's an expert on
interpersonal relationships.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.179
She's raising three kids.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.048
Just imagine Brian
is one of your kids.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.187
I'm serious.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.790
You know how to handle that guy.

07:36.824 --> 07:41.161
Yeah, you're the most
manipulative person I know.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.229
No, I mean, really.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.901
You know, up until
this weekend thing,

07:47.935 --> 07:50.170
that job was working
out pretty good.

07:50.203 --> 07:52.439
I was able to be home
before DJ got here,

07:52.472 --> 07:54.642
it was this close
to be unbearable.

07:54.675 --> 07:55.543
Uh oh.

07:55.576 --> 07:58.278
Big pow wow in the hen house.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.346
Get in here.

07:59.379 --> 08:02.282
Yes, dear.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.684
Hi, honey.

08:03.717 --> 08:04.852
Hi, honey.

08:04.885 --> 08:05.786
Hi, honey.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.155
Ooh, a threesome.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.056
You wish.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.390
How was your day?

08:10.423 --> 08:11.992
You won't believe.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.227
Oh, I manage to unload
the rest of that sheet rock

08:14.261 --> 08:15.128
on Eddie Griswold.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.096
Oh, good.

08:16.129 --> 08:19.132
Well, we're talking
about me now.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.001
You know Brian?

08:21.034 --> 08:23.704
The little maggot?

08:23.737 --> 08:25.673
He's going to make
me work weekends.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.340
Why didn't you
tell him he couldn't?

08:27.374 --> 08:30.310
Oh gee, now why
didn't I think of that?

08:30.343 --> 08:33.947
We were just suggesting that
she use her natural abilities

08:33.981 --> 08:36.416
and suck up to the guy.

08:36.449 --> 08:39.086
You catch more flies with
honey than with vinegar.

08:39.119 --> 08:42.022
Oh, a meeting of minds.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.423
That's good advice, Roseanne.

08:43.456 --> 08:45.392
That's how careers are made.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.861
Just treat the guy like
you respect him and act

08:47.895 --> 08:49.029
like you think he's
great, and keep

08:49.062 --> 08:51.031
your real feelings to yourself.

08:51.064 --> 08:54.434
Oh, you mean I should treat
him like he's my husband?

08:54.467 --> 08:56.203
Bingo.

08:56.236 --> 08:57.638
You just treat him
like you treat me

08:57.671 --> 08:59.607
and I guarantee that he won't
want to be anywhere near you

08:59.640 --> 09:00.440
on weekends.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.883
Roseanne, go ahead and
clear out your register.

09:14.487 --> 09:16.289
Hey-- hey, Brian.

09:16.323 --> 09:18.859
You know, your Mustang
is looking awesome.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.394
- Yeah, well, it's a classic.
- For sure.

09:21.428 --> 09:24.865
Hey, have a nice day,
sir, please come again.

09:24.898 --> 09:28.035
You know, if you ever need
that little beauty washed,

09:28.068 --> 09:30.971
my dad does run
the Jack-o Wash and

09:31.004 --> 09:33.373
all my friends get in for free.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.076
They use rags or brushes?

09:36.109 --> 09:37.177
Well, anything you want.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.647
Just say you're
a friend of mine.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.114
Andrew.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.016
That's good to know,
I'll keep it in mind.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.117
No sweat, guy.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.252
He's such a suck up.

09:48.555 --> 09:52.125
Brian, If I stay late
tonight to do side work,

09:52.159 --> 09:55.495
I'm going to be in the
overtime for the week.

09:55.528 --> 09:57.998
And you told me to always
let you know, so is that OK,

09:58.031 --> 10:00.333
because I could really
use the extra money.

10:00.367 --> 10:01.234
No.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.235
Go home, have a good night.

10:06.573 --> 10:07.875
Andrew.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.409
You feel like working
some overtime?

10:09.442 --> 10:10.310
Cool.

10:10.343 --> 10:11.211
All right.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.646
Clean out the fry bins.

10:12.680 --> 10:13.647
Rosanne, you can head out, too.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.854
Well, don't feel bad, Tina.

10:20.888 --> 10:23.090
It's not worth acting
like Andrew just

10:23.123 --> 10:25.025
to get your own car.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.861
That's for sure.

10:27.895 --> 10:32.432
Course, so unless you've
got a husband and three kids.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.067
That's for sure.

10:34.101 --> 10:36.403
Yeah, I guess you can
catch more flies with manure

10:36.436 --> 10:37.237
than you can with honey.

10:40.841 --> 10:41.742
Hey.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.643
Dammit!

10:43.677 --> 10:44.978
What?

10:45.012 --> 10:47.647
I can't fasten
the choke spring.

10:47.681 --> 10:48.716
What are you making?

10:48.749 --> 10:50.317
Do you know anything
about carburetors?

10:50.350 --> 10:51.251
They go under the hood.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.186
Why?

10:53.220 --> 10:54.955
I'm in big trouble.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.189
What's the matter?

10:56.223 --> 10:58.792
I'm flunking shop.

10:58.826 --> 11:02.262
Well, that's a
sign of intelligence.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.464
I can't afford to flunk shop.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.700
Because if my grade point
average falls below 3.5,

11:06.734 --> 11:09.302
then the school will
let me keep my job.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.139
If I lose my job, I lose my car.

11:12.172 --> 11:15.108
If I lose my car, I'm nothing.

11:15.142 --> 11:17.044
Well, I don't mean to
drop names or nothing,

11:17.077 --> 11:20.714
but I just happen to know the
best carburetor man in town.

11:20.748 --> 11:23.650
I don't suppose
he owes you a favor.

11:23.683 --> 11:27.354
Yeah, about 15
years' worth, boss.

11:36.063 --> 11:39.933
Brian Cayman is
coming here for dinner?

11:39.967 --> 11:42.669
Doofy Brian Cayman?

11:42.702 --> 11:46.673
No, Mr. Brian Cayman, my boss.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.875
Why is he eating here?

11:47.908 --> 11:51.044
He has parents.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.380
Because your dad's going
to help him with something.

11:53.413 --> 11:54.547
With what, a zit?

11:57.384 --> 12:00.187
And we're just going to happen
to have his favorite dinner

12:00.220 --> 12:01.955
on the table, too.

12:01.989 --> 12:03.390
What's his favorite dinner?

12:03.423 --> 12:05.859
Wieners.

12:05.893 --> 12:08.295
Even the flat heads
don't hang out with him.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.864
Where is your brother?

12:10.898 --> 12:13.366
- He's playing hide and go seek.
- With who?

12:13.400 --> 12:15.368
With you.

12:15.402 --> 12:18.705
Oh, yeah, right.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.273
Where's he hiding?

12:20.307 --> 12:23.676
I'm not going to tell you.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.979
Well, I sure hope I'm
going to be able to find

12:26.013 --> 12:27.480
him before we have dinner.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.049
Gee, I wonder where he--

12:29.082 --> 12:32.685
[gasp] David Jacob, I see you.

12:32.719 --> 12:34.888
You're it, now you hide.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.556
No, you go hide
for me, because you

12:36.589 --> 12:38.959
are so good at being hid.

12:38.992 --> 12:41.294
OK.

12:41.328 --> 12:42.963
Hey hi, sis, how you doing?

12:42.996 --> 12:43.864
Pretty good.

12:43.897 --> 12:46.033
My, expecting company?

12:46.066 --> 12:48.401
As a matter of fact, I am.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.469
Anybody good?

12:49.502 --> 12:50.938
No.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.273
What a laugh you'll
have when I tell you.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.508
Oh, tell me, tell me, tell me.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.409
My boss.

12:56.443 --> 12:59.212
The little maggot?

12:59.246 --> 13:00.447
Uh huh.

13:00.480 --> 13:04.751
Well, very good, Roseanne,
I'm very proud of you.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.219
What time is he coming over?

13:06.253 --> 13:08.388
He'll be here in
about a half hour.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.223
Plenty of time for
you to eat and get

13:10.257 --> 13:11.491
out of here before he shows up.

13:11.524 --> 13:12.659
Oh, I can stay.

13:12.692 --> 13:14.862
I don't go on duty till 8:00.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.897
No, I don't want
you to see me grovel.

13:16.930 --> 13:21.334
Please, let me stick around
for the initial greasing.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.336
No, you'll just
make everything worse.

13:23.370 --> 13:24.671
How do I make it worse?

13:24.704 --> 13:26.874
With that great knack you
have for saying the wrong thing

13:26.907 --> 13:28.408
at the wrong time.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.110
Well, Dan's going to be
here, and you're always

13:30.143 --> 13:33.881
saying how tactless he is.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.415
Hi, Jackie.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.249
How's the herpes?

13:41.821 --> 13:43.290
ROSEANNE: Did you
get good chips?

13:43.323 --> 13:44.524
Yeah.

13:44.557 --> 13:45.993
And two six packs of
Bailey's Old Style root beer.

13:46.026 --> 13:46.826
Where's DJ?

13:49.562 --> 13:53.333
Oh, I look for him later.

13:53.366 --> 13:56.069
I think you're going way
overboard on this deal.

13:56.103 --> 13:57.704
Isn't it enough that
I have to rebuild

13:57.737 --> 13:59.439
Junior's carburetor for him?

13:59.472 --> 14:00.440
Are you kidding me?

14:00.473 --> 14:01.875
You're the one who
told me to kiss up

14:01.909 --> 14:03.176
to the guy in the first place.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.045
I didn't tell you
to kiss up to him,

14:05.078 --> 14:06.413
I just said treat him right.

14:06.446 --> 14:11.684
Oh, please, you gotta let me
stick around and watch this.

14:11.718 --> 14:13.086
Jackie, go to work.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.654
And he better
bring his own tools,

14:14.687 --> 14:15.923
because he's not using mine.

14:15.956 --> 14:18.058
Dan, he can use anything
he wants, long as I

14:18.091 --> 14:20.193
don't have to work on Saturday.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.395
[doorbell rings]

14:22.429 --> 14:24.531
Would somebody let
the little maggot in?

14:29.069 --> 14:29.903
Hi.

14:29.937 --> 14:31.704
Hope I'm not late.

14:31.738 --> 14:34.975
I came right from the office.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.309
Let me take your
coat for you, huh?

14:36.343 --> 14:39.379
Oh, thanks.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.848
You look familiar.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.451
Yeah.

14:44.484 --> 14:47.187
You go to Lanford, right?

14:47.220 --> 14:49.456
Yeah.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.558
Fifth period lunch, right.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.226
Yeah.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.594
How you doing, Dan Connor.

14:54.627 --> 14:57.697
Husband, father,
carburetor specialist.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.598
Oh, I really appreciate--

14:58.631 --> 15:00.700
Come on out to the garage.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.302
You can hear the
dinner bell from there.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.843
You know, I got as far as
putting on the choke spring,

15:10.877 --> 15:12.879
but I didn't know
what to do after that.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.481
Coming over here
was a good start.

15:14.514 --> 15:15.848
Yeah, that's the truth.

15:20.620 --> 15:24.057
Look, uh, can we talk
man to man here, pal.

15:24.091 --> 15:24.958
Oh, yeah.

15:24.992 --> 15:25.858
Yeah, sure.

15:25.892 --> 15:26.994
Good.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.029
Well here's the deal.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.330
I don't want to
be a shop teacher,

15:30.363 --> 15:32.699
and you don't want to
be a garage mechanic.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.434
So why don't you just let
me put this thing together

15:34.467 --> 15:37.470
for you, you take it
in, you get the credit,

15:37.504 --> 15:39.206
and you ease up on my wife.

15:39.239 --> 15:40.673
I have never come
on to your wife.

15:47.480 --> 15:48.415
Good.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.849
Good.

15:49.882 --> 15:55.055
Um, what I was talking about
was making her work weekends.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.991
Look, Mr. Conor,
have a job to do.

15:58.025 --> 16:00.460
Whoops, Mr. Fumble Thumbs.

16:00.493 --> 16:03.463
Parts everywhere.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.632
Roseanne's the best person
I got down there, really.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.700
That's-- that's the
only reason I want

16:07.734 --> 16:09.102
her working on the weekends.

16:09.136 --> 16:12.539
Well, we need her to
work here on weekends.

16:12.572 --> 16:15.575
Schedules can be changed.

16:15.608 --> 16:16.409
Good.

16:21.948 --> 16:25.485
I could have had a
new car right away.

16:25.518 --> 16:29.456
But when I saw my Stanger, oh.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.724
It was like falling in love.

16:31.758 --> 16:34.894
Oh, so that's what
falling in love is like.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.029
Yes, dear.

16:36.063 --> 16:39.366
It's like car ownership.

16:39.399 --> 16:40.500
Yep.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.635
So I waited.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.438
I saved up for an entire year.

16:45.472 --> 16:49.476
And now I am the owner of one
lean, mean driving machine.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.743
And the women go wild for it.

16:53.813 --> 16:56.383
More milk?

16:56.416 --> 16:58.118
Actually, I should get going.

16:58.151 --> 16:59.018
Already?

16:59.052 --> 17:00.553
Yeah, uh.

17:00.587 --> 17:01.654
Thanks for dinner,
though, it was

17:01.688 --> 17:02.955
really nice meeting all of you.

17:02.989 --> 17:03.990
Yeah.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.025
A million thanks.

17:06.059 --> 17:09.096
You're keeping the
Cayman legend alive.

17:09.129 --> 17:11.364
Don't mention it.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.366
Um, Brian.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.603
I really do need to
talk to you about work.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.971
Roseanne, I think my
office is the place for that.

17:19.005 --> 17:21.141
Well, let's just go
step into my office,

17:21.174 --> 17:22.275
huh, it won't take long.

17:25.044 --> 17:28.014
I just wanted you to see
how important my family is,

17:28.047 --> 17:29.349
and how important it
is we're together,

17:29.382 --> 17:32.018
because weekends are the only
time that we have together.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.320
Roseanne--

17:33.353 --> 17:35.455
I mean, I want to be a team
player, and all like that,

17:35.488 --> 17:38.625
but my family's really
important to me, too.

17:38.658 --> 17:39.759
Roseanne, I
understand that you

17:39.792 --> 17:41.361
need to be with your family.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.495
You do?

17:42.529 --> 17:45.098
Yeah, and you
can't work weekends.

17:45.132 --> 17:46.333
That's what you're
saying, right?

17:46.366 --> 17:48.201
Yeah, exactly.

17:48.235 --> 17:49.936
Well, there it is.

17:49.969 --> 17:52.172
You can pick up your
last check on Monday.

17:52.205 --> 17:53.906
- What?
- You're fired.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.775
What the hell's
wrong with you, bub?

17:55.808 --> 17:56.909
What the hell's wrong with you?

17:56.943 --> 17:58.178
You've been in this
house three hours,

17:58.211 --> 17:59.379
you couldn't say
something about it--

17:59.412 --> 18:00.313
Now wait a minute--
[becky and darlene yelling]

18:00.347 --> 18:01.481
DAN: Hey, you wait
a minute, pal.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.015
You're at my house, what's
the matter with you?

18:03.049 --> 18:04.384
BRIAN: I wasn't--

18:04.417 --> 18:06.253
DAN: I had to do your homework
for you, and now you fire--

18:06.286 --> 18:09.021
Dan, please.

18:09.055 --> 18:11.324
OK, now, just slow down.

18:11.358 --> 18:13.293
You're firing me over
this weekend thing, right?

18:13.326 --> 18:15.162
I mean, you're really firing me?

18:15.195 --> 18:16.963
Hey, I'm sorry.

18:16.996 --> 18:18.131
You're sorry?

18:18.165 --> 18:19.399
You're going to be sorry,
because I'm the best

18:19.432 --> 18:21.100
worker you've got down there.

18:21.134 --> 18:24.404
No, you're fast, but
your attitude stinks.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.339
Well, something
stinks in here, Bri,

18:26.373 --> 18:28.975
but it ain't my attitude.

18:29.008 --> 18:30.410
Listen, kid.

18:30.443 --> 18:33.846
I need that job, and I hate like
hell that I do, but I need it.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.382
And I'm not working
there because I

18:35.415 --> 18:37.217
don't have enough allowance.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.519
I'm paying a mortgage and
putting food on the table

18:39.552 --> 18:40.687
and buying clothes
for three kids.

18:43.456 --> 18:46.759
I don't think you
even understand that.

18:46.793 --> 18:50.597
I don't think you
understand anything.

18:50.630 --> 18:54.033
You're not grown up enough yet
to understand that your life

18:54.066 --> 18:56.636
doesn't always turn out the
way you planned it to be,

18:56.669 --> 18:58.605
and sometimes you end up doing
stuff that you thought you'd

18:58.638 --> 19:00.139
never do in a million
years, but you

19:00.173 --> 19:01.874
still have to do
it because there's

19:01.908 --> 19:05.278
nothing else you can do.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.914
Oh, you don't want to leave
without your carburetor.

19:07.947 --> 19:10.217
And your coil spring.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.918
And here's your--

19:11.951 --> 19:14.387
Butterfly bell.

19:14.421 --> 19:15.855
And don't forget your--

19:15.888 --> 19:16.956
Secondary.

19:19.992 --> 19:20.793
Brian.

19:24.664 --> 19:25.832
Would you like fries with that?

19:34.106 --> 19:38.511
Whoa, ho whoa whoa whoa.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.213
It's an occasion.

19:40.247 --> 19:42.882
Yeah.

19:42.915 --> 19:46.619
I've definitely sunk
to an all time new low.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.187
I've been fired by Opie.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.627
Well, let's look
at it this way.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.663
The kid's a loser.

19:56.696 --> 19:57.964
By the time he's
our age, he'll be

19:57.997 --> 20:02.602
a lonely, bitter
multimillionaire.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.437
I pity him.

20:04.471 --> 20:05.805
Well.

20:05.838 --> 20:09.008
You'll definitely have more time
to spend with your family now.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.345
Cozy evenings around the hearth.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.046
Sing-alongs.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.315
It'll will be loads of fun.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.517
Hm, yeah.

20:17.550 --> 20:22.088
Till we have to break down
and eat one of the children.

20:22.121 --> 20:23.222
We're OK.

20:23.256 --> 20:25.292
I've been working a lot,
I've got stuff lined up,

20:25.325 --> 20:26.326
you'll find something.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.828
Something better.

20:28.861 --> 20:33.266
Yeah, I've been thinking
about a career in diplomacy.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.902
I think that's
definitely your calling.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.737
Maybe an ambassadorship.

20:37.770 --> 20:40.239
Yeah, to the Bahamas.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.609
Oh, there's loads
of unrest down there.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.143
They'll need somebody
who can lay on the beach

20:44.176 --> 20:46.245
and drink margaritas.

20:46.279 --> 20:47.314
Yeah.

20:47.347 --> 20:50.917
And just imagine all
the gala luncheons,

20:50.950 --> 20:52.419
the parties, the dances.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.559
I hear they're hiring
over at Bucky Burger.

21:11.338 --> 21:14.273
DARLENE: DJ!

21:14.307 --> 21:15.274
Nothing?

21:15.308 --> 21:16.476
Nothing.

21:16.509 --> 21:17.677
DAN: DJ, it's bedtime.

21:17.710 --> 21:21.013
The game's over, son.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.649
He's not in the garage.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.083
I don't think
he's in the house.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.552
He's got to be somewhere.

21:25.585 --> 21:27.454
Well, maybe we ought
to call somebody.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.258
(WHISPER) Dan.

21:43.169 --> 21:45.204
You're it.
