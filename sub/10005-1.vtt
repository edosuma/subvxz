00:25.818 --> 00:27.527
Tonight's the night.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.654
Cropsy's going to get what he deserves.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.073
- Remember what he did to you, Snoop?
- Yeah!

00:32.073 --> 00:33.994
And when he beat up Jamie
really bad for nothing?

00:34.743 --> 00:37.453
Billy says Cropsy's been getting away
with this shit for years.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.163
If we pull this off,
it'll be the biggest number

00:39.164 --> 00:41.124
Camp Blackfoot has ever seen.

00:41.125 --> 00:42.792
I wanna find out who's in, okay?

00:42.793 --> 00:43.876
We're all in.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.879
- Jamie, you with us?
- Right.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.548
- Snoop?
- Yeah, I'm in.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.174
Billy?

00:50.175 --> 00:52.427
What, are you kidding?
I can't stand that creep.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.053
What about you?

00:54.888 --> 00:58.266
As long as I get to see that
motherfucker squirm.

00:58.267 --> 01:01.853
Don't worry. Tonight's the night
that we scare the shit out of Cropsy.

01:01.854 --> 01:03.604
Because when he wakes up,

01:03.605 --> 01:06.899
when he sees it,
he's gonna have a heart attack.

01:07.151 --> 01:10.528
He's gonna go crazy. He's gonna go crazy.

01:10.529 --> 01:12.363
Okay, Billy, let's see what you got.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.832
All right, where's Kent?

01:24.084 --> 01:25.585
He's already inside.

01:26.086 --> 01:29.464
- Matches. Matches, matches!
- Here.

01:40.642 --> 01:41.851
Sit, wait.

02:24.812 --> 02:28.523
Hold it. Okay, guys, this is it.
Take the light.

02:28.524 --> 02:33.361
Give me the box. Run around the back.
Let's get him.

02:33.362 --> 02:34.695
Do it!

04:52.125 --> 04:54.627
Holy shit! We gotta get him out of there.

05:31.790 --> 05:34.792
- I can't believe it.
- Come on, let's get out of here. Come on!

05:57.691 --> 06:00.776
- So how long you been working here?
- I started working Sunday.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.945
- Oh, yeah, you like your job?
- Yeah, it's fine. Great.

06:02.946 --> 06:05.656
When you seen what I seen,
you'll soon change your mind.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.783
Hey, listen, after two months
of working here,

06:07.784 --> 06:09.368
you're gonna feel like an old man.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.829
Guys like you won't last five minutes.

06:11.830 --> 06:12.955
- Listen, I...
- Hey, listen, you got a minute?

06:12.956 --> 06:13.998
No, I'm supposed to be on duty...

06:13.999 --> 06:15.291
I wanna show you something
down the hall.

06:15.292 --> 06:18.878
After you see this guy, you'll never
wanna come back in here again.

06:19.546 --> 06:23.049
Man, this guy's burned so bad,
he's cooked.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.552
A fucking Big Mac. Overdone.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.471
You know what I mean?

06:29.014 --> 06:31.182
It's a miracle he's still alive.

06:31.183 --> 06:33.851
Was me, I'd prefer to be dead.

06:34.186 --> 06:36.687
No way I'd wanna be like this freak.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.564
He's a monster, man.

06:39.649 --> 06:42.610
I been working here 10 years
and I'm telling you,

06:42.611 --> 06:45.363
I ain't never seen anything like this.

06:46.031 --> 06:48.157
- In here, man. Come on, take a look.
- Listen, I gotta go.

06:48.158 --> 06:51.744
You wanna be a doctor, right?
This is what you gotta see.

06:51.995 --> 06:54.455
This is where it's at.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.088
Now this is burns.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.718
You ain't never gonna forget this man.

07:08.178 --> 07:11.972
As long as you live,
you never gonna see a freak like this.

07:17.396 --> 07:19.480
Come on, man, take a look.

07:20.649 --> 07:23.192
You ain't gonna see nothing
standing over there.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.529
Come on, man, take a look.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.408
Come on.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.083
Come on, take a look.

07:46.550 --> 07:48.092
Oh, my God!

09:31.112 --> 09:32.696
It's been a long struggle,

09:32.697 --> 09:35.908
but now that you've regained
your strength, it's time for you to leave.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.327
Considering how badly
you were burned, you're lucky to be alive.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.496
The first few months outside
will be the hardest.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.831
We're sorry,
the skin grafts just didn't take.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.959
There's nothing more we can do
for at least six months.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.669
I know you still resent those kids,

09:46.670 --> 09:49.463
but try not to blame anyone
for what happened.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.924
It was an accident, purely an accident.

09:51.925 --> 09:55.553
You've got to forget your hatred.
Control your feelings for revenge.

09:55.554 --> 09:59.181
Anger and resentment won't
bring back the past. You know that.

09:59.182 --> 10:02.935
You may find it difficult, at first,
to adjust to a normal life again.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.980
But with time you will adjust.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.525
Well, this is home, honey.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.242
Hey, if you're coming in,
why don't you come on in?

11:00.410 --> 11:02.745
I mean, ain't no use standing out there.

11:14.466 --> 11:17.885
Are you coming up? 'Cause I'm going in.

11:34.444 --> 11:38.030
Like the low-key lighting?
That's all right with me.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.411
Aren't you gonna take off your hat?

11:45.580 --> 11:49.416
Of course, if you wanna keep your hat on,
keep your hat on.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.877
I mean, I got guys who wanna do
it wearing all sorts.

11:54.005 --> 11:56.256
Of course, you're the one who's paying.

11:57.092 --> 12:00.052
All right, do me a favor, will you, honey?
Let's move it?

12:00.345 --> 12:02.096
I mean, I gotta earn a living.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.070
Oh, my God!

12:19.823 --> 12:22.908
Who are you? Leave me alone.

12:22.909 --> 12:26.995
Will you, please? Please, just go.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.624
Just please go. I... Please go!

12:30.625 --> 12:34.753
No! No, get away!
Get away from me, please!

12:37.006 --> 12:37.923
Help!

12:40.885 --> 12:42.761
Help! Help!

13:20.175 --> 13:23.343
Rhoda! Rhoda! Rhoda!

13:26.723 --> 13:28.182
Come on!

13:47.786 --> 13:49.244
Throw the ball!

14:00.256 --> 14:03.550
- Look at that ass. See that?
- Oh, yeah.

14:03.551 --> 14:06.261
I want it, I want it.
I mean, you don't got to wrap it,

14:06.262 --> 14:10.098
you don't have to send it.
Take it home, now, as is.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.559
You're crazy, man. That's a no-sale.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.895
Hey, it's mine by divine right.

14:14.896 --> 14:17.648
Hey, divine this, that's prime meat.
You ain't buying it.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.610
- You try it, man.
- Watch this.

14:21.611 --> 14:25.113
Now we're cooking on gas!
Throw the ball! Throw it!

14:26.533 --> 14:29.493
- You're not doing anything tonight, right?
- Why? Who wants to know?

14:29.494 --> 14:31.286
I want you at the rec room at 8:30.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.830
- Eddy!
- Just be there.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.292
Nice try, Eddy. Nice try.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.961
What do you say now, sucker?

14:38.962 --> 14:41.088
You old smoothie, you.
You're a devil, ain't you?

14:41.089 --> 14:42.965
Natch, baby, natch.

14:42.966 --> 14:44.716
Come on, come on!

14:47.679 --> 14:49.847
Tiger, run! That's yours!

15:24.299 --> 15:26.008
Jeez, it's gotta be here somewhere.

15:26.009 --> 15:29.761
Tiger, come on, forget it!
We'll use another ball.

15:38.855 --> 15:41.273
Come on, Tiger. Find the ball.

15:43.401 --> 15:45.235
Give me a chance. I'll find it.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.255
Got it!

16:05.256 --> 16:06.673
All right, Tiger!

16:30.114 --> 16:32.574
Karen, Todd and I have been
going out for years.

16:32.575 --> 16:35.577
You can't expect it to be the same
with Eddy. You just met him.

16:35.578 --> 16:39.081
- I know, but...
- Tiger! Stop it.

16:39.082 --> 16:40.666
Sophie, don't encourage her.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.626
I really like Eddy.

16:42.627 --> 16:47.464
But every time I think he's serious and I
really start to get into him, he blows it.

16:47.465 --> 16:48.590
- I've had it.
- So...

16:49.676 --> 16:51.134
Oh, Tiger, stop that!

16:54.138 --> 16:58.141
Sometimes he really scares me. It's true.

16:59.102 --> 17:01.770
It's got so I told the supervisor
I didn't want to go on the overnight.

17:01.771 --> 17:04.106
You're kidding! What did he say?

17:05.316 --> 17:08.276
He said if things got too heavy
I could come back to camp.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.862
Karen, I think that if you feel
that badly about Eddy,

17:10.863 --> 17:12.903
you should just tell him that
you're not interested.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.700
I can't.

17:16.118 --> 17:20.372
See, sometimes I really like him.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.416
You better just get on with it, then.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.165
- Hey, Sally.
- Hi, Barb.

18:45.541 --> 18:48.168
Hey, Dave show up last night?

20:17.049 --> 20:22.888
Michelle? Michelle, is that you?

20:23.764 --> 20:26.433
Okay, everybody. Time to get up.
Come on.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.020
Wake up, Tiger. We're late. Come on.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.564
Sophie, my love.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.692
- Hey, gorgeous, rise and shine.
- Michelle.

20:35.693 --> 20:39.613
Come on, you guys. It's a beautiful day.

20:43.117 --> 20:44.910
Michelle, is that you?

20:48.164 --> 20:49.539
Who's there?

20:56.964 --> 20:58.256
Did you hear that?

21:06.557 --> 21:07.933
What's going on?

21:10.645 --> 21:13.104
Sally, Sally, what is it? What happened?

21:13.105 --> 21:17.442
Alfred. Alfred, he looked at me
in the shower and he wouldn't leave.

21:18.903 --> 21:21.154
Hold it, hold it. Where you going?

21:22.782 --> 21:25.075
Come here. Come on.

21:27.787 --> 21:30.538
You are sick. You know that?
You are really sick.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.040
Wait a minute. What's going on here?

21:32.208 --> 21:35.001
Alfred's been prowling around
the girls' shower.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.966
- Karen, take sally up to the bunk, okay?
- Okay.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.842
Just take it easy for a while, honey.

21:44.887 --> 21:47.305
What do you have to say
about that, Alfred?

21:47.807 --> 21:49.057
I only meant to scare her.

21:49.058 --> 21:52.727
You only meant to scare her!
Well, you sure as hell did scare her.

21:52.728 --> 21:55.768
- Okay. Eddy, take him up to the rec room.
- You are some sort of degenerate!

21:55.856 --> 21:58.733
- I'll talk with him.
- You'll talk with him?

22:03.489 --> 22:05.365
He's a sexual pervert.

22:05.366 --> 22:07.075
What do you expect me to do,
cut his balls off?

22:07.076 --> 22:08.243
That kid's weird, Todd.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.287
What the hell was he doing
snooping around here?

22:10.288 --> 22:13.248
- He's just a kid. Kids do that.
- Did you do that?

22:13.249 --> 22:15.333
Why the hell are you covering
for him anyway?

22:15.334 --> 22:16.918
I think we should throw him out.

22:16.919 --> 22:19.838
Okay. So he's a little strange. But I'll talk with him.
I'll straighten him out.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.464
You're a pushover.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.968
You always believe the best.
You're too easy.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.387
Okay, listen.

22:27.596 --> 22:31.266
If I think he's going to be a problem,
I'll make sure he's off the camp, okay?

22:33.144 --> 22:36.479
- Okay?
- Okay.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.903
All right, Alfred.
What the hell were you doing out there?

22:43.904 --> 22:45.655
What were you trying to pull?

22:45.656 --> 22:48.116
Come on, if you don't talk to me,
you're gonna be talking to the supervisor.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.327
And I don't think you want that.

22:50.328 --> 22:52.245
You know, I saved you
a lot of embarrassment out there

22:52.246 --> 22:54.914
by not bawling you out
in front of the other kids.

22:54.915 --> 22:58.251
I think you owe me something for that.
Start talking.

23:00.004 --> 23:02.130
I only wanted to scare her.

23:02.131 --> 23:04.090
You think she's gonna understand that?

23:04.091 --> 23:07.302
Or the supervisor? Or Glazer?
What about Glazer?

23:07.303 --> 23:10.722
Look, it's not just Glazer. It's everybody.

23:10.890 --> 23:14.559
I mean, they're all always picking on me.

23:15.061 --> 23:17.020
I don't have any friends.

23:18.356 --> 23:21.524
I didn't want to come to this camp
to begin with, you know.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.568
It's like the army. I mean,

23:24.195 --> 23:27.113
someone's always telling me
what to do all the time.

23:27.114 --> 23:28.907
It's the same thing every year.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.992
I sort of know what you're going through.

23:30.993 --> 23:34.079
Five years ago,
when I was in summer camp,

23:34.080 --> 23:37.665
I didn't just get bawled out
by the counselor. I got sent home.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.334
- You did?
- Yeah.

23:39.335 --> 23:42.796
You don't have to take on
this whole camp by yourself.

23:42.797 --> 23:46.591
If you've got a problem,
if you want someone to talk to, I'm here.

23:46.592 --> 23:47.634
Okay?

23:50.012 --> 23:51.179
Okay.

23:52.681 --> 23:56.518
I'd have socked him right in the eye.
He's real spooky, that Alfred.

23:56.519 --> 24:00.188
- Imagine, creeping around the shower.
- I'm sure he didn't really mean it.

24:00.189 --> 24:03.316
He said he just wanted to scare you,
to get back at Glazer.

24:03.317 --> 24:04.692
That's great, isn't it?

24:04.693 --> 24:07.362
He wants to get back at Glazer,
so he scares the shit out of Sally?

24:07.363 --> 24:09.030
Let's forget about it?

24:09.031 --> 24:10.698
We have the canoe trip
to look forward to.

24:10.699 --> 24:14.411
Yeah, Sally, just think.
Three nights alone with Alfred.

24:15.538 --> 24:17.705
Hey, you gonna make it
with Glazer, Sally?

24:17.706 --> 24:18.790
Cool it, Marnie.

24:19.667 --> 24:22.585
- Imagine doing it with Glazer.
- Doing what?

24:23.045 --> 24:25.088
The weight of all those muscles on you.

24:28.509 --> 24:29.968
I'd take Alfred any day.

24:30.511 --> 24:32.137
Lay off, will you?

24:32.388 --> 24:34.514
Why's everyone so down on Glazer?

24:39.395 --> 24:41.271
Look out where you're going, punk.

24:41.814 --> 24:44.607
You know, I ought to break your legs?

24:44.859 --> 24:47.068
And twist your head off.

24:47.069 --> 24:49.612
Now, I'm gonna tell you just one time.

24:50.156 --> 24:53.575
You stay away from my girl.
You understand that?

24:59.790 --> 25:03.001
What are you staring at,
you little fucking weirdo?

25:03.627 --> 25:05.712
Look, I'm warning you.

25:05.713 --> 25:08.214
If I even catch you looking at her,

25:08.507 --> 25:13.470
I'm gonna tear you up so bad,
your own mother won't recognize you.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.305
- You dig?
- Glazer!

25:15.973 --> 25:19.559
- What's your problem?
- Oh, no problem, Todd. No problem.

25:20.436 --> 25:22.812
All right, get out of here, you understand?

25:27.485 --> 25:29.152
And remember, it's a long summer.

25:30.154 --> 25:32.363
Little jerk gives me the creeps.

25:33.324 --> 25:36.409
And when was the last time you won
a personality contest, Glazer?

25:36.410 --> 25:38.036
Hey, what's the matter, Todd?

25:38.287 --> 25:39.787
You ought to ease up on me, man.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.164
You're coming down on the wrong guy.

25:41.165 --> 25:43.541
He's the one that was caught
looking at the girls in the shower.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.293
You ought to be coming down
hard on him.

25:45.294 --> 25:48.630
- You know what your problem is?
- No, man, what's my problem?

25:48.631 --> 25:51.674
- You can't take anyone your own size.
- Oh, yeah? Well, that's bullshit.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.885
Yeah, well, let me tell you something.

25:53.886 --> 25:56.888
You cause any problems
for any kid on this camp,

25:56.889 --> 25:58.973
and I'm gonna bust your ass.

26:14.156 --> 26:16.449
Come on, Alfred. You gotta do
the swimming thing, all right?

26:16.450 --> 26:19.118
Because if you go in tomorrow,
I can't go in after you.

26:19.119 --> 26:21.079
I don't think this will work out.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.957
Don't wuss out on us. Just...
Fish, listen to Fish.

26:23.958 --> 26:27.001
- He's been in, right?
- Look, it's beautiful water.

26:27.002 --> 26:28.670
There's no problem
in swimming or diving.

26:28.671 --> 26:30.672
- I mean, your head's the main thing.
- Head's the main thing.

26:30.673 --> 26:32.131
- It's the heaviest part of your body.
- Right.

26:32.132 --> 26:34.092
So, wherever your head goes,
your body's gotta follow. Right?

26:34.093 --> 26:36.261
And you'll be in big trouble if it doesn't.

26:36.262 --> 26:37.971
- Dave, Dave, look.
- Hi, girls.

26:37.972 --> 26:38.930
- Hey, girls!
- Hey!

26:39.890 --> 26:40.848
Hi, guys.

26:41.517 --> 26:43.268
Give him a little encouragement.

26:43.269 --> 26:44.352
Look, it's no problem.

26:44.353 --> 26:46.229
- Just watch Fish.
- Watch me.

26:46.230 --> 26:47.814
Esther Williams, look at that.

26:48.190 --> 26:51.150
- And we know Flipper!
- Go, go!

26:51.151 --> 26:53.736
- You see how easy that is?
- I hate swimming.

26:54.530 --> 26:58.116
Not much you do like? Drown.

26:59.285 --> 27:00.868
Follow me, Alfred, all right?

27:23.559 --> 27:25.476
Are you crazy? He can't swim.

27:25.477 --> 27:29.522
Yeah, I'm crazy, and you better save him
if you don't want him to drown.

27:30.065 --> 27:31.149
Help!

27:31.150 --> 27:34.027
Hey, Sally? I'm coming to get you, babe.

27:36.739 --> 27:40.241
- Are you okay, man?
- Hey, want me to fix Glazer for you, man?

27:40.242 --> 27:42.160
- Get him up.
- Come on, get him up. Get him up.

27:42.745 --> 27:44.078
Come on, bring him up.

27:44.079 --> 27:46.664
Lie down, on your back. On your back, Al.

27:47.583 --> 27:50.668
You all right? You breathing?
You breathing? That a boy.

27:50.669 --> 27:54.839
You all right? Speak to me.
Come on, speak to me, Al.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.633
That's it, don't cough. Speak. Words.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.761
- I'm okay.
- All right. All right.

28:03.599 --> 28:04.682
Hi, girls!

28:07.478 --> 28:09.854
You look like a bunch of mermaids
up here. You know that?

28:10.272 --> 28:12.774
- Don't worry. He'll get his.
- Yeah? I gotta tell you.

28:12.775 --> 28:14.734
Fifty bucks buys you the top torpedo
in town.

28:14.735 --> 28:16.778
- Who's that? Woodstock?
- Sure.

28:16.779 --> 28:19.781
Oh, come on. Woodstock couldn't knock
over an umbrella stand.

28:19.782 --> 28:24.369
- Got the pea-shooter with you, Woody?
- Yeah, I sure do.

28:24.620 --> 28:25.703
Right there.

28:29.541 --> 28:32.335
- Hi, Sally. Hi, pretty girl.
- Hi.

28:32.836 --> 28:34.420
Hey, Sal, you wanna go
for a swim with me?

28:34.421 --> 28:35.505
No way.

28:36.632 --> 28:39.467
- What's the matter?
- I don't wanna get my hair wet.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.891
All right, guys, I got him in my range.

28:47.810 --> 28:49.268
Hey, Dave.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.980
Are sure you want me
to go through with this?

28:53.482 --> 28:57.193
Alfred. This is about to be
the greatest moment in your life.

28:58.654 --> 29:05.576
There will be four commands:
Ready, aim, fire and run.

29:05.911 --> 29:09.288
Glazer's gonna go crazy. Shit!

29:09.957 --> 29:15.753
Ready. Aim. Pork him!

29:17.506 --> 29:19.173
Shit, what the hell was that?

29:26.306 --> 29:27.932
You think that's funny?

29:27.933 --> 29:29.809
Woodstock, I think you got him.

29:31.729 --> 29:34.188
You aren't gonna think it's so funny
when I get my hands on you.

29:34.189 --> 29:36.482
And Woodstock, you're a dead boy,
you hear me?

29:42.322 --> 29:43.698
Sorry, Glazer.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.368
You won't think that's so funny
when I get my hands on you.

29:47.369 --> 29:48.619
You're a dead boy...

29:58.547 --> 30:00.423
- How many?
- Give me three.

30:00.424 --> 30:03.217
- All right.
- I'll take three.

30:03.218 --> 30:04.552
All right.

30:10.642 --> 30:13.478
- Howdy do, boys? What are you doing?
- Hey, how you doing?

30:13.479 --> 30:16.814
He's under, he's up, he's in there.
All right.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.733
- Who ordered the Playboy?
- Over here.

30:18.734 --> 30:21.319
Dave, did you get my Hustler?

30:21.695 --> 30:23.446
Hustler? What do you want
with Hustler, Woodstock?

30:23.447 --> 30:26.699
- You're too small.
- Hey, size never stopped Woody.

30:26.700 --> 30:29.076
That's the world bantam-weight
jerk-off champ over there?

30:29.077 --> 30:31.704
Just stick with me, kid.
Keep flexing the muscle?

30:55.354 --> 30:57.563
God bless her mom and dad.

30:57.564 --> 30:59.941
You guys are a real bunch of wimps.
You know that?

31:00.108 --> 31:03.528
Looking at girlie magazines.
You guys make me sick.

31:04.112 --> 31:05.738
You ought to try the real thing
sometimes, man.

31:05.739 --> 31:06.864
Let me tell you that.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.617
We make you sick, do we, Glazer?

31:09.618 --> 31:12.787
Well, then, you won't mind paying a
new market price for a bag of rubbers.

31:12.788 --> 31:14.121
Five bucks.

31:14.540 --> 31:17.291
- I'll pay. Get me what I asked for?
- Absolutely, absolutely.

31:17.292 --> 31:20.294
Absolutely? Absolutely shit, man.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.922
Look, I asked for lubricated rubbers.

31:22.923 --> 31:25.049
These aren't lubricated rubbers,
you understand that?

31:25.050 --> 31:26.634
What am I? Masters & Johnson?

31:26.635 --> 31:28.553
You want lubes, buy your own.

31:28.554 --> 31:31.848
All right, I'll buy my own.
And let me tell you something, pal.

31:31.849 --> 31:34.684
- I ain't paying for these. You got that?
- I got that.

31:50.993 --> 31:53.286
- What's up, man?
- My God!

31:54.413 --> 31:57.665
- What are you looking at?
- At the window, there.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.334
There, there, at the window.

32:00.794 --> 32:03.546
- Take it easy, man. What's going on?
- It was a face.

32:03.547 --> 32:05.631
A horrible face at the window.

32:07.384 --> 32:08.801
Yeah, forget it, girls.

32:09.636 --> 32:11.012
I saw it. It was there.

32:11.013 --> 32:13.097
Well, there sure as hell
ain't nothing out there now.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.237
What's that? Who's in there?

32:49.760 --> 32:51.636
Hey, you wanna know something, man?
You're weird.

32:51.637 --> 32:54.055
That's your fucking problem, man.
You're a weirdo, man.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.851
Hey, what's keeping you guys?
There's not gonna be any dinner left.

32:58.852 --> 33:00.811
Come on, let's go. Come on.

33:01.229 --> 33:03.064
Forget this. Let's go get the girls.

33:03.065 --> 33:05.900
So you saw a face? Shit!

33:09.738 --> 33:12.907
- What was all that about?
- Nothing.

33:31.176 --> 33:34.220
We made it! Don't worry, guys.

33:34.805 --> 33:37.264
What's this? Oh, my God!

33:37.766 --> 33:39.850
Good shot, kid, good shot.

33:40.435 --> 33:44.939
Ladies! They're eating without us!
They're eating without us!

33:44.940 --> 33:47.024
You're late! You are late!

33:49.778 --> 33:51.278
Hey, girls.

33:52.155 --> 33:54.031
- Hi, Sally.
- Oh, God.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.367
- How you doing?
- Okay.

33:56.368 --> 33:59.453
Okay? Just doing okay? You look good.

34:00.414 --> 34:03.457
Hey, what do you say you and me go
for a ride tomorrow in my canoe?

34:04.584 --> 34:07.211
- Maybe.
- Maybe? What do you mean, maybe?

34:07.212 --> 34:09.547
Hey, what's the matter?
You don't trust me?

34:10.590 --> 34:13.967
- Hey, Redford, let's go. Come on?
- Wait a minute, I'm talking to her.

34:13.969 --> 34:17.221
"Hey, I'm talking to her."
Can I talk to her, too?

34:17.806 --> 34:20.224
Hey, Todd! Todd?

34:20.225 --> 34:22.351
- Glazer, calm down.
- Yeah.

34:22.351 --> 34:25.980
- What are you staring at, you little creep?
- Hey, Glazer.

34:26.148 --> 34:28.315
Come off it, what harm is he doing?

34:28.608 --> 34:30.568
He's been staring at me,
that's the harm he's doing.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.027
Maybe he wants your body, Glazer.

34:33.321 --> 34:36.407
So, you girls all set
for the trip tomorrow?

34:36.408 --> 34:40.244
Nothing I can get you? Life jacket?
Spermicide?

34:41.329 --> 34:43.914
Hey, you gotta be prepared.
You know what I mean?

34:46.293 --> 34:47.208
Oh, God!

34:48.128 --> 34:50.087
All right, which one of you guys
got my vitamin E?

34:50.088 --> 34:53.132
Vitamin E? Christ, Woodstock,
you don't believe in all that crap?

34:53.132 --> 34:56.135
Just don't knock it.
You leave my champ alone?

34:56.719 --> 34:59.638
- Well, I haven't got it.
- Well, I'm going back to the cabin to get it.

35:00.849 --> 35:02.808
Quiet. Quiet, please.

35:05.020 --> 35:06.312
Quiet, please.

35:07.147 --> 35:09.523
Quiet. Quiet, please.

35:20.243 --> 35:23.788
- Come on, let's keep it... Come on, quiet.
- Quiet!

35:27.209 --> 35:28.375
That's better.

35:29.127 --> 35:32.630
Okay, I just want to say a couple of things
about the overnight.

35:32.881 --> 35:35.341
Some of you older ones
are leaving tomorrow

35:35.342 --> 35:37.301
for a three-day canoe
trip to Devil's Creek.

35:38.261 --> 35:41.514
I know you can all look after yourselves
pretty good.

35:41.515 --> 35:45.059
Just remember,
it's a long way from home.

36:19.928 --> 36:21.303
Shit!

36:39.447 --> 36:42.366
Well, I guess you've all
made friends by now,

36:42.367 --> 36:45.536
so however you team up,
stick with your buddy.

37:54.981 --> 37:58.984
- Woodstock?
- Todd, you scared the shit out of me.

37:58.985 --> 38:00.611
Come on, let's go.

38:06.159 --> 38:10.871
Sorry I scared you. Glazer and Fish said
you were really sick. I was worried.

38:11.873 --> 38:14.375
- Why'd they say that?
- I don't know.

38:15.627 --> 38:20.047
Just a dumb joke. I'm getting a little
fed up with Glazer's sense of humor.

38:22.133 --> 38:26.136
One other thing. I want
one good swimmer with each group.

38:26.638 --> 38:29.515
That means one in each canoe,
at all times.

38:30.141 --> 38:33.227
One more stunt like that
and you're on your way home, got it?

38:33.228 --> 38:34.478
That goes for you, too.

38:34.479 --> 38:36.897
Done this trip before,
and they know the scene.

38:36.898 --> 38:40.359
And one final thing.
Before you leave for the overnighter,

38:40.360 --> 38:44.196
please check in with me to confirm
your travel arrangements home.

38:44.572 --> 38:46.907
- Got it?
- We got it.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.597
Hey, Woodstock, straighten up.

39:11.266 --> 39:14.143
I'm doing the best I can, man.
Can't you take it easy?

39:14.144 --> 39:17.396
Hey, I told you not to beat your
schlong last night. It drains your power.

39:19.107 --> 39:20.190
Straighten up, Glazer.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.568
When Glazer straightens up, Sally,
you better run.

39:39.794 --> 39:42.796
- Michelle, control your campers.
- Todd!

39:50.138 --> 39:51.722
Come on, you guys.

39:53.641 --> 39:55.851
We're canoeing, not showering.

40:25.423 --> 40:29.051
There was a camp not far from here,
just across the lake.

40:30.470 --> 40:32.596
It was called Camp Blackfoot.

40:33.223 --> 40:37.142
No one goes there anymore.
Everything burned down.

40:37.519 --> 40:40.437
There's nothing left, except the ruins.

40:41.856 --> 40:45.734
Now this camp had a caretaker,
a really evil bastard.

40:46.611 --> 40:48.987
And his name was Cropsy.

40:51.533 --> 40:55.452
Everyone hated Cropsy.
For a start, he was a drunk.

40:56.121 --> 40:58.122
Two bottles of whisky a day, no problem.

40:58.123 --> 41:01.708
Like, most of the time he was
somewhere out in space,

41:01.709 --> 41:04.878
but if he caught you, look out!

41:06.339 --> 41:10.175
Because Cropsy could strip the paint
off the walls,

41:10.176 --> 41:12.219
just by breathing on them.

41:15.557 --> 41:17.724
Now this Cropsy was a sadist.

41:18.351 --> 41:23.021
I mean, he got real pleasure
out of hurting people, scaring them.

41:24.274 --> 41:28.777
And he had these garden shears,
you know?

41:29.237 --> 41:32.114
The kind with long thin blades.

41:33.074 --> 41:36.243
And he carried them all the time,
wherever he went.

41:36.703 --> 41:40.080
And he had this kind of demonic way
of looking at you.

41:40.748 --> 41:44.460
One time, this Cropsy really went after
this kid from Brooklyn.

41:45.044 --> 41:49.506
Followed him around night and day.
He made this kid's life a living hell.

41:50.341 --> 41:52.718
But this time he chose the wrong guy.

41:53.261 --> 41:56.096
Because the kid and some of his buddies
had planned a little prank

41:56.097 --> 41:59.141
that would scare the living shit
out of Cropsy.

41:59.767 --> 42:03.562
Only problem was, the gag went wrong.

42:04.314 --> 42:08.484
The next thing anyone knows, Cropsy's
trapped alive and burning in his bunk.

42:08.485 --> 42:11.570
They try to get him out but the fire's
so fierce they can't reach him.

42:11.571 --> 42:15.491
All they can do is stand outside,
and listen to him cry out in agony.

42:15.492 --> 42:19.578
They say he smashed his way through
the bunkroom door, just a mass of flames.

42:19.579 --> 42:24.249
And as he screamed out, burned alive,
he cried out,

42:24.250 --> 42:27.961
"I will return. I will have my revenge."

42:31.007 --> 42:35.511
They never found his body. He survived.

42:36.930 --> 42:41.225
He lives on whatever he can catch.
Eats them raw.

42:41.726 --> 42:45.938
Alive. No longer human.

42:47.857 --> 42:50.943
Right now, he's out there.

42:52.070 --> 42:56.114
Watching. Waiting.

42:56.115 --> 42:58.909
Don't look, he'll see you.

42:59.494 --> 43:03.372
Don't move, he'll hear you.

43:05.124 --> 43:07.459
Don't breathe...

43:07.835 --> 43:09.211
You're dead!

43:13.925 --> 43:15.133
Oh, shit!

43:24.269 --> 43:26.103
You asshole, Eddy.

43:26.104 --> 43:27.896
- Real funny, man.
- You freak.

43:27.897 --> 43:30.274
You motherfucker!

43:47.208 --> 43:48.584
You know,
that little joke you played

43:48.585 --> 43:50.752
back at the campfire wasn't very funny.

43:50.753 --> 43:54.381
- You don't think so?
- Not that you scared me, but...

43:54.382 --> 43:55.966
No, of course not.

43:56.801 --> 43:59.261
Eddy, is there really a Cropsy maniac?

43:59.262 --> 44:02.180
Sure there is. He's from my neighborhood.

44:02.682 --> 44:05.684
Know what he does?
He takes paper bags, see?

44:05.685 --> 44:08.437
He fills them with dog shit,
then he lights them

44:08.605 --> 44:11.148
and leaves them in front of somebody's
door and when they open the door,

44:11.149 --> 44:12.691
they go like that.

44:15.361 --> 44:19.156
- You're crazy.
- Yeah, I know. Crazy for you.

44:24.787 --> 44:27.539
I can't figure you out, you know.

44:28.249 --> 44:30.876
I mean, first you tell me you like me,
and then 10 seconds later

44:30.877 --> 44:33.253
you're looking off here, looking off there,
like you don't even know who I am.

44:33.254 --> 44:37.174
- I do like you, Eddy. But...
- But what?

44:37.467 --> 44:40.177
You're always talking about
how many women you've had.

44:40.178 --> 44:42.929
I don't want to be just another statistic.

44:42.930 --> 44:45.057
Karen, knock it off, will you?

44:45.725 --> 44:48.727
Come on, if two people like each other,

44:49.228 --> 44:51.688
if they want each other, so you do it.

44:51.981 --> 44:53.857
What's wrong with that?

44:54.651 --> 44:57.653
We like each other, right? And we're alone.

44:58.696 --> 45:02.783
You can't blame me for trying, can you?
Come on, what do you say?

45:03.660 --> 45:05.952
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

45:06.537 --> 45:08.789
- All right, let's take a swim.
- What? Now?

45:08.790 --> 45:09.790
I haven't got a swimsuit.

45:09.874 --> 45:12.250
So, who needs a bathing suit?
Who's gonna see you here?

45:13.503 --> 45:14.711
You.

45:21.552 --> 45:24.262
You're free to do what you want.
I'm taking a dip.

45:24.263 --> 45:26.556
- Eddy?
- What?

45:27.058 --> 45:28.058
Promise?

45:28.976 --> 45:32.896
Hey, relax.

45:33.189 --> 45:35.857
Just going to take a quiet swim around
and head back to the camp.

45:37.985 --> 45:39.236
Come on.

46:02.176 --> 46:03.844
Oh, this is great!

46:05.638 --> 46:08.140
You gotta come in. This is the best.

46:20.611 --> 46:23.029
- It's nice?
- It's freezing.

46:23.030 --> 46:25.282
Come here, I'll warm you up.

46:33.666 --> 46:34.666
Eddy.

46:35.501 --> 46:37.669
Don't fight it, don't fight it.

46:40.965 --> 46:43.759
You're not gonna start that now, are you?

46:48.556 --> 46:49.765
Eddy!

46:49.766 --> 46:52.142
Come on,
you gonna start that again, now?

46:55.897 --> 46:57.397
Cut it out, Eddy.

46:58.566 --> 47:00.776
Why'd you come out here, then?

47:03.905 --> 47:05.405
You promised!

47:05.907 --> 47:07.866
Get the fuck out of my face.

47:27.303 --> 47:28.261
Fuck!

47:36.437 --> 47:38.855
Oh, no! Where are my clothes?

47:51.118 --> 47:53.119
Come on, you guys.

47:56.165 --> 47:57.415
Come on.

48:02.797 --> 48:04.756
Where are my clothes?

48:06.008 --> 48:07.425
Come on, please?

48:12.223 --> 48:13.390
Oh, no.

49:53.866 --> 49:55.617
- Okay, Eddy, wake up.
- Get up.

49:55.618 --> 49:57.243
- Wake up.
- Where's Karen?

49:57.244 --> 49:59.079
- What do you mean?
- You know what he means.

49:59.080 --> 50:01.414
- Where's Karen?
- How should I know where she is?

50:01.415 --> 50:03.249
- You were with her last night, remember?
- So what?

50:03.250 --> 50:04.751
So she never came back.

50:04.752 --> 50:06.878
I didn't look for her
because I figured she was with you.

50:06.879 --> 50:08.088
Shit.

50:08.089 --> 50:10.215
So where is she, Eddy? Come on, get up.

50:10.216 --> 50:13.593
Hey, what the hell is this?
Some sort of interrogation here?

50:13.594 --> 50:15.637
Don't give me that! Where is she?

50:15.638 --> 50:17.347
All right. Okay.

50:18.057 --> 50:20.016
Hey, Karen!

50:20.393 --> 50:22.143
Cut the act, Eddy.

50:22.520 --> 50:24.771
We've already looked all over.
She's not here.

50:24.772 --> 50:27.273
Are you sure you didn't go
just a little too far?

50:27.274 --> 50:28.441
Hey, take it easy?

50:28.442 --> 50:31.236
"Take it easy"!
Christ, you guys make me sick.

50:32.613 --> 50:35.323
You know, Karen told me
she was really scared of you.

50:35.324 --> 50:37.784
Oh, yeah, she was scared of me, huh?
Then how come

50:37.785 --> 50:39.369
- she went with me last night?
- I don't know.

50:39.370 --> 50:41.037
Maybe it's because she likes you,
you dumb bastard.

50:41.038 --> 50:42.789
Now tell me, what happened?

50:42.790 --> 50:44.541
- Come here, will you?
- What?

50:46.252 --> 50:50.338
Look, all right, I must have come on
a little strong, okay?

50:50.339 --> 50:53.258
Came down here, went swimming,
and I don't know, she...

50:53.259 --> 50:55.176
- Look, what did she do?
- She didn't do anything.

50:55.177 --> 50:57.137
She called me a few names,
swam back to shore,

50:57.138 --> 50:58.979
and I figured she went back
with everyone else.

50:59.056 --> 51:00.265
You jerk!

51:02.143 --> 51:04.269
Michelle! Hey, Michelle.

51:04.270 --> 51:05.854
The canoes are gone.

51:05.855 --> 51:07.480
What do you mean, they're gone?

51:07.481 --> 51:09.399
They're gone. They're not here.

51:13.279 --> 51:14.654
Karen.

51:14.655 --> 51:17.449
- Why would she take the canoes?
- She might have let them go accidentally.

51:17.450 --> 51:18.491
Why?

51:18.492 --> 51:20.160
Because the supervisor
gave her permission

51:20.161 --> 51:22.829
to go back to camp if things got too heavy.

51:22.830 --> 51:26.374
Oh, come on, will you?
We had a fight. Nothing serious.

51:26.375 --> 51:28.418
She's gonna let all the canoes go?

51:28.627 --> 51:30.503
For Christ's sake.

51:31.088 --> 51:32.964
Okay. So they had a fight.

51:32.965 --> 51:35.675
She took one of the canoes back to the
main camp, but where are the other five?

51:35.676 --> 51:37.135
I don't know.

51:37.136 --> 51:39.804
Maybe the kids are just pulling a prank.

51:42.391 --> 51:43.475
Marnie!

51:43.476 --> 51:46.853
Get all the kids together
to where the canoes were moored.

51:46.854 --> 51:47.937
Okay!

52:02.244 --> 52:04.579
Okay, okay. Quiet, quiet.

52:04.580 --> 52:07.540
I'm not kidding now. Does anyone know
what happened to the canoes?

52:07.541 --> 52:10.668
Oh, yeah, Dave sold them
to some Indian guy.

52:10.669 --> 52:13.338
Come on, you guys, this could be serious.

52:13.339 --> 52:15.381
Yeah, they can't just vanish.
I want them found.

52:16.133 --> 52:19.010
There's your answer,
sitting right over there.

52:20.179 --> 52:22.806
What'd you do with the goddamn canoes,
you little freak?

52:23.265 --> 52:25.058
Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

52:25.059 --> 52:27.435
Yeah, I bet you don't know
what we're talking about?

52:27.436 --> 52:30.105
Glazer, why don't you lay off him?
He doesn't know anything about it.

52:30.106 --> 52:31.815
Yeah, cut it out, Glazer.

52:35.277 --> 52:36.653
Look, here's what we're gonna do, okay?

52:36.654 --> 52:38.863
We're gonna split up
and search this whole area.

52:38.864 --> 52:39.989
They gotta be around here somewhere.

52:39.990 --> 52:42.534
What happens if we don't find them?

52:42.535 --> 52:45.453
I don't know.
We'll build a raft or something.

52:45.996 --> 52:47.831
Why don't we just walk back?

52:48.707 --> 52:50.542
Michelle, take a look around.

52:50.918 --> 52:52.710
It's thick forest for miles.

52:53.504 --> 52:56.506
No, we need those canoes.
Okay, come on, let's start looking.

52:56.924 --> 52:58.341
Come on, it will be fun.

52:58.884 --> 53:00.718
- I'm looking forward to it?
- Come on.

53:00.719 --> 53:02.846
- Come on, it will be fun.
- Yes.

53:03.305 --> 53:05.431
- Better lay off the girl.
- Okay.

53:05.432 --> 53:06.975
Come on, chief.

53:15.609 --> 53:18.736
- What are you thinking?
- I don't know.

53:19.446 --> 53:21.364
I just feel real uneasy.

53:21.782 --> 53:23.032
About Karen.

53:23.868 --> 53:25.618
Yeah, something's wrong.

53:26.453 --> 53:28.997
There's no way
all those canoes can just disappear

53:28.998 --> 53:33.042
and Karen wouldn't go back to
the main camp in the middle of the night.

53:34.253 --> 53:36.880
Well, what are we going to do
if we don't find the canoes?

53:36.881 --> 53:39.299
Are we really going to build a raft?

53:39.967 --> 53:41.467
We're gonna have to.

53:44.680 --> 53:47.098
Man, what the hell are we supposed to
be looking for, anyway?

53:47.099 --> 53:48.808
- Your mother!
- Your mother!

53:48.809 --> 53:50.643
Hey, guys, here's a piece of wood.

53:50.644 --> 53:55.064
I still don't understand how Todd expects
us to build a raft with all this stuff.

53:55.065 --> 53:57.025
Hey, Dave.
You know, you've never failed us.

53:57.026 --> 53:59.444
How about a big speedboat with
a Merkel engine on the back?

53:59.445 --> 54:01.237
Oh, why, certainly!

54:02.531 --> 54:05.283
- Hey, what about this?
- What about that?

54:05.284 --> 54:07.952
What do you expect?
This looks like a houseboat for ants.

54:07.953 --> 54:10.121
- It floats.
- It floats?

54:10.122 --> 54:11.414
- Dave.
- I told you.

54:11.415 --> 54:13.291
Come, Jane. We seek wood.

54:13.834 --> 54:15.919
- Come on.
- Come on, you guys.

54:17.046 --> 54:20.256
Mad at me, Sally.
I mean, shit, I try to be nice.

54:20.257 --> 54:22.175
I asked you to go swimming with me.
You wouldn't go.

54:22.176 --> 54:23.927
And then on the canoe ride,
you wouldn't even go with me.

54:23.928 --> 54:25.595
- There's a piece of wood.
- What's the matter?

54:25.596 --> 54:27.347
You won't even talk to me?
What do I got to do?

54:27.348 --> 54:29.265
- I mean, what do I gotta do?
- Glazer.

54:29.266 --> 54:32.936
- What's the matter?
- Just cool your engines.

54:33.562 --> 54:35.355
Come on, we're meant to be
looking for wood.

54:35.356 --> 54:36.439
Yeah, right.

54:37.149 --> 54:38.441
Glazer, no!

54:42.238 --> 54:44.739
Go ahead. Shit!

54:45.241 --> 54:46.991
You're something, ain't you?

54:47.326 --> 54:50.036
- Hey, Eddy throw me over that rope?
- All right.

54:50.037 --> 54:51.788
This is going to take
longer than you think.

54:51.789 --> 54:53.909
We'll be okay as long as
they leave by this afternoon.

54:54.083 --> 54:56.042
Hey, guys. Look what I found.

54:56.043 --> 54:57.418
- Oh, great!
- Oh, good.

54:57.419 --> 54:59.712
Eddy, give her a hand.
Take it over to the pile?

54:59.713 --> 55:01.506
- All right.
- Here you go.

55:19.566 --> 55:20.942
No, Glazer! No!

55:20.943 --> 55:23.194
- What's the matter?
- Not here!

55:23.195 --> 55:25.238
What's the matter now?
You know you want to.

55:25.239 --> 55:27.323
Later... Maybe.

55:29.618 --> 55:31.786
- You mean that?
- Sure.

55:33.080 --> 55:34.289
That a girl, Sally.

55:34.290 --> 55:36.332
Listen, you can trust me, you hear?

55:36.959 --> 55:38.918
It's gonna be real good.

55:39.461 --> 55:41.170
Real good, I promise.

55:58.731 --> 56:00.606
Okay, kids, listen up. Eddy's in charge.

56:00.607 --> 56:01.607
All right, Eddy!

56:01.608 --> 56:03.818
Okay? He'll get you back
to the main camp.

56:03.819 --> 56:06.404
Eddy, no side trips.
Straight back to camp, right?

56:06.405 --> 56:09.324
- No lefts, no rights, straight ahead.
- Remember, it's just like paddling a canoe.

56:09.325 --> 56:11.868
Try to make good time
so you get there before dark.

56:11.869 --> 56:13.328
You call this a paddle?
This is an eggbeater.

56:13.329 --> 56:15.872
If we're not back by tomorrow,
send in the Marines.

56:16.957 --> 56:19.584
All right, here we go. Bon voyage!

56:31.638 --> 56:36.976
Come on, paddle together!
Paddle together!

56:39.730 --> 56:42.565
I'll be 84 by the time you get help here.

56:42.566 --> 56:44.484
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

57:07.341 --> 57:09.092
Come on, dig in. Dig in.

57:10.052 --> 57:11.803
- I'm tired.
- I'm tired.

57:11.804 --> 57:13.888
What do you mean you're tired?
We're doing all the work up here.

57:13.889 --> 57:15.014
Shut up, Woodstock!

57:15.182 --> 57:18.309
Hey, hey, hey!
Will you all please shut the fuck up

57:18.310 --> 57:21.437
- and just keep paddling. Okay?
- All right.

57:21.438 --> 57:23.356
Let's go.

57:23.357 --> 57:26.651
- Eddy? Eddy?
- What?

57:27.569 --> 57:29.821
How come Karen left, really?

57:29.822 --> 57:34.784
Hey, look, it's like Michelle said, okay?
She was upset about something, all right?

57:39.873 --> 57:41.541
Come on.

57:41.542 --> 57:44.085
- Hey, you guys! Look over there!
- What?

57:44.086 --> 57:45.670
- It's one of our canoes! It is, it's ours!
- It is!

57:45.671 --> 57:47.171
- One of our canoes!
- No, it isn't.

57:47.172 --> 57:48.506
- It is, too.
- It's gotta be.

57:48.507 --> 57:50.883
Yeah, who else would be stupid enough
to lose it?

57:50.884 --> 57:54.137
- Come on!
- Dig in there. Let's go!

57:56.557 --> 57:59.725
Come on, Eddy, strong man, let's go.

57:59.726 --> 58:01.561
- Just keep going.
- I'm paddling, I'm paddling.

58:01.562 --> 58:03.729
- Let's go, Eddy.
- Let's go!

58:03.730 --> 58:06.357
Man, that looks like...

58:06.650 --> 58:08.734
- All right.
- There's some of that muscle.

58:08.735 --> 58:10.528
Hurry up, let's get ahead.

58:20.456 --> 58:23.416
- Come on!
- I'm coming.

58:38.807 --> 58:42.185
- Here we go, Fish.
- I'm going. I got seaweed on here.

58:43.437 --> 58:45.938
Don't worry about that,
we'll have a canoe!

58:47.107 --> 58:49.901
- I can't believe it!
- Eddy, Eddy!

58:49.902 --> 58:52.403
Get ready to grab it, man.
I'm going on board.

59:03.123 --> 59:05.041
- Woody, get ready to grab it.
- All right.

59:05.042 --> 59:07.168
We're going to go on,
so you got to get ready to hold on.

59:07.169 --> 59:08.127
All right.

59:52.548 --> 59:56.551
God, look at this.
We really could get lost so easily here.

59:57.177 --> 59:59.095
That's kind of what I was hoping for.

59:59.763 --> 01:00:01.389
Get out.

01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:05.560
Do you think those kids got back all right?

01:00:05.561 --> 01:00:07.520
Probably back right now.

01:00:08.897 --> 01:00:10.481
- I hope so.
- Come on, don't worry about them.

01:00:10.482 --> 01:00:11.774
Let's go.

01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:14.193
Come on, it's gonna get dark soon.

01:00:17.864 --> 01:00:19.365
Easy does it.

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:28.416
Those kids really had fun today, though.

01:00:28.417 --> 01:00:33.004
I know. Look, the way we built that raft,

01:00:33.005 --> 01:00:36.048
- they're probably safer than we are.
- I was impressed.

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:41.512
Where did you learn to build a raft?

01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:43.973
Raft building, in the Boy Scouts.

01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:47.226
Thank God for the Boy Scouts.

01:00:48.395 --> 01:00:50.771
- I've been wondering...
- About what?

01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:55.401
Well, about whether

01:00:55.402 --> 01:00:57.820
you're ticklish!

01:01:08.957 --> 01:01:12.251
Come on, we better get back
before it gets dark?

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:14.128
I've got a better idea.

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:26.349
Glazer!

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:28.643
Don't you think we shouldn't be
so far away from the others?

01:01:28.644 --> 01:01:30.645
Trust me, baby. Trust me. It's okay.

01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:32.897
It's okay.

01:01:35.108 --> 01:01:37.026
Easy, Glazer, please.

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:40.571
Relax, baby. Be good, it's gonna be good.
Trust me.

01:01:40.989 --> 01:01:43.199
- Relax.
- Easy.

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:45.618
Stop!

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:48.746
Hold still.

01:02:05.597 --> 01:02:08.724
- Shit!
- That's all?

01:02:10.811 --> 01:02:11.977
Is it?

01:02:14.106 --> 01:02:15.314
I'm sorry, Sally.

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:17.233
- I don't know what happened.
- It's okay.

01:02:17.818 --> 01:02:19.652
It'll be better next time, baby. Trust me.

01:02:19.653 --> 01:02:21.487
"Trust me, baby."

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:24.907
Sally?

01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:28.577
- You're cold?
- Yes.

01:02:30.205 --> 01:02:32.790
You didn't do too much to warm me up.

01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:36.544
So, I guess you wanna go back, is that it?

01:02:40.006 --> 01:02:41.340
No.

01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:46.345
Why don't we stay? We might...

01:02:49.224 --> 01:02:51.809
What are you saying? You mean that?

01:02:52.561 --> 01:02:54.562
Do you really mean that?

01:02:56.356 --> 01:02:57.648
I guess so.

01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:03.529
That's a girl.

01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:14.290
Hey, wanna know something?

01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:17.501
I'm gonna sneak on back to the campsite.

01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:19.253
Get some matches.

01:03:19.254 --> 01:03:21.839
Come back here and build us a hot fire.

01:03:22.174 --> 01:03:24.091
What do you think about that?

01:03:27.095 --> 01:03:30.431
- Don't be long.
- Not a second longer than I gotta be.

01:03:41.902 --> 01:03:45.154
Listen, you stay warm, you hear?
Because I'm coming right back.

01:04:27.989 --> 01:04:30.574
No, please, no! No!

01:05:57.537 --> 01:05:58.829
Sally?

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:01.624
Sorry it took so long, babe.

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:03.459
Hey, Sally?

01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:07.129
Hey, listen now,
you playing hide and seek?

01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:12.927
Peekaboo!

01:07:09.317 --> 01:07:12.069
Todd, Todd. You gotta wake up.
You gotta wake up.

01:07:13.279 --> 01:07:15.739
- Now, come on. Hurry up. Wake up.
- Come on, Alfred.

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:17.950
No, come on, hurry.
You gotta wake up now, come on.

01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:20.536
- What time is it?
- Look, I couldn't help it.

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:23.205
It happened so fast, it was like...
He was out.

01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:27.042
He was out and...
And he was on top of him in a second.

01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:30.921
I was... I didn't know.
I was following and he...

01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:34.508
Look... Glazer's dead.

01:07:36.803 --> 01:07:39.596
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- No, no, really.

01:07:39.597 --> 01:07:41.306
- I saw him. I saw him kill Glazer.
- Look, would you be quiet?

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:44.101
- You're going to wake everybody up.
- The same guy at the window...

01:07:44.102 --> 01:07:45.269
That I saw at the window.

01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:47.104
Remember? I told him about
the guy at the window.

01:07:47.105 --> 01:07:48.731
- What guy?
- The burned face.

01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:52.693
He's dead.

01:07:56.281 --> 01:07:58.991
Alfred, if this is another one of your
tricks, you know, I'm not really...

01:07:58.992 --> 01:08:00.242
You don't believe me.

01:08:00.618 --> 01:08:02.578
You're just like the others,
you don't believe me.

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:04.997
- I'm telling you, I saw him.
- Would you be quiet?

01:08:05.749 --> 01:08:07.916
I'll go with you, all right? Okay?

01:08:12.797 --> 01:08:13.964
Come on.

01:08:32.233 --> 01:08:33.524
Oh, my God.

01:08:38.198 --> 01:08:39.281
Todd!

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.103
What do you see?

01:09:51.104 --> 01:09:52.979
- It's a raft.
- It's a raft.

01:09:52.981 --> 01:09:53.939
I don't know.

01:09:55.441 --> 01:09:57.442
- I know.
- What are they doing?

01:09:57.443 --> 01:09:59.611
Now, why would they get off the raft?

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.865
You guys are really falling for this,
aren't you?

01:10:02.866 --> 01:10:03.949
For what?

01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:07.244
I mean, you still don't realize we got
Ringling Brothers out there.

01:10:07.245 --> 01:10:09.621
Hey, Eddy! You guys!

01:10:09.622 --> 01:10:12.249
All right, come on. Enough is enough?

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:14.459
Come on, bring it in, you guys.

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.628
This is ridiculous.
Come on, come on, come on. Let's go.

01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:19.464
- Dave, wait. Stay, I want to go in.
- Hey, can we go in?

01:10:19.465 --> 01:10:22.050
No, just stay here okay.
Let me check it out.

01:10:22.594 --> 01:10:24.553
Okay, we'll stay here.

01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:27.556
You guys are in trouble.
Counselor coming.

01:10:57.337 --> 01:11:00.088
Hey, Dave, what do you really
think is happening?

01:11:00.673 --> 01:11:03.175
I don't know. Am I swimming out there?
Hang on a minute.

01:11:12.352 --> 01:11:13.810
Is Alfred there?

01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:15.145
- Hey, there's Todd.
- Where?

01:11:15.146 --> 01:11:16.480
Hey, Todd!

01:11:16.481 --> 01:11:19.149
Todd.

01:11:23.696 --> 01:11:25.739
Can you do something about the raft?

01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:34.039
Stay! Stay here!

01:11:45.385 --> 01:11:48.178
I know we're gonna die, for real.

01:11:49.889 --> 01:11:51.473
We'll never get back.

01:12:00.984 --> 01:12:04.736
Just get back to camp and get me
some help. That's all I want you to do.

01:12:04.904 --> 01:12:06.905
Just get me some help.

01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:11.159
All right, come on, come on.

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:14.139
Alfred!

01:13:48.132 --> 01:13:50.550
Michelle, I'm so tired.
I can't paddle anymore.

01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:55.180
Paddle! Now, we're almost there.
What do you want to do, stop right now?

01:13:56.766 --> 01:13:59.309
Deep down there you can do it. Come on.

01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:01.603
You can do it.

01:14:04.232 --> 01:14:06.274
- Come on.
- Let's go.

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:25.461
Alfred!

01:14:38.099 --> 01:14:38.599
Todd?

01:14:52.447 --> 01:14:53.822
Grab this pole.

01:14:56.075 --> 01:14:58.243
Come on, just another inch. Pull it.

01:15:01.122 --> 01:15:03.081
What's with the raft?
Where are my canoes?

01:15:03.082 --> 01:15:04.458
Jeff, where's the outboard?

01:15:04.459 --> 01:15:06.918
What do you want with the outboard?

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:18.847
Listen to me. There is a killer out there.

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:21.349
Oh, come on, Michelle.
Todd put you up to this?

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:23.101
God damn it! Look at those kids!

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:16.071
Can't we go any faster?

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:18.490
It's a small motor, Michelle.
It won't go any faster.

01:16:19.575 --> 01:16:21.326
How long before the police get there?

01:16:21.327 --> 01:16:23.119
Oh, God, I hope they're there.

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:24.829
They said they were going by helicopter.

01:17:51.584 --> 01:17:53.543
Help! Help!

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:08.803
Alfred?

01:20:10.389 --> 01:20:11.598
Alfred!

01:20:45.633 --> 01:20:46.591
Alfred.

01:22:14.054 --> 01:22:16.347
Cropsy's going to get
what he deserves.

01:22:16.348 --> 01:22:18.683
If we pull this off,
it'll be the biggest number

01:22:18.684 --> 01:22:20.435
Camp Blackfoot has ever seen.

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:26.524
Tonight's the night
that we scare the shit out of Cropsy.

01:22:29.987 --> 01:22:32.280
- Jamie, you with us?
- Yeah, sure.

01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:33.781
- Snoop?
- I'm in.

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:38.536
- Billy?
- I can't stand the son of a bitch.

01:22:39.163 --> 01:22:40.914
What about you, Todd?

01:23:47.272 --> 01:23:48.439
Alfred?

01:23:49.942 --> 01:23:51.025
Alfred.

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:05.808
Todd!

01:25:11.982 --> 01:25:12.982
Todd.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:22.992
Todd!

01:25:22.993 --> 01:25:24.327
Alfred!

01:26:56.461 --> 01:26:57.712
Alfred, get out!

01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:33.372
Let's go.

01:28:02.319 --> 01:28:04.320
They never found
his body but they say

01:28:05.364 --> 01:28:08.532
his spirit lives in the forest.

01:28:10.077 --> 01:28:11.452
This forest.

01:28:12.329 --> 01:28:15.748
A maniac, a thing no longer human.

01:28:16.667 --> 01:28:18.376
They say

01:28:18.377 --> 01:28:21.337
he lives on whatever he can catch.

01:28:21.338 --> 01:28:23.339
Eats them raw, alive maybe.

01:28:24.841 --> 01:28:28.886
And every year
he picks on a summer camp

01:28:30.097 --> 01:28:33.391
and seeks his revenge
for the terrible things

01:28:34.268 --> 01:28:36.018
those kids did to him.

01:28:37.562 --> 01:28:39.313
Every year he kills.

01:28:41.275 --> 01:28:44.402
Right now, he's out there. Watching.

01:28:45.904 --> 01:28:47.113
Waiting.

01:28:48.573 --> 01:28:51.867
So don't look, he'll see you.

01:28:51.868 --> 01:28:53.828
Don't breathe, he'll hear you.

01:28:56.081 --> 01:28:58.249
Don't move, you're dead!
