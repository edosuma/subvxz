00:06.238 --> 00:09.007
- Ooh, new answering machine.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.508
- Yes. And do me a favor,

00:10.510 --> 00:12.711
This time if you don't
like someone's message,

00:12.713 --> 00:13.878
Just press delete.

00:13.880 --> 00:16.615
Don't flush it down
the toilet.

00:16.617 --> 00:17.716
[beep]

00:17.718 --> 00:19.184
Hi, this is bugs and daffy.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.719
We're not here,
please leave a message.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.687
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
How do you know I'm not here?

00:22.689 --> 00:23.955
Maybe I'm screening the call.

00:23.957 --> 00:26.191
- Fine.
You leave the message.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.959
- Really? [gasps]

00:27.961 --> 00:30.061
My voice on
the answering machine?

00:30.063 --> 00:32.229
Thanks, bugs.
[clears throat]

00:32.232 --> 00:35.700
[beep]
hello. Hello?

00:35.702 --> 00:37.702
I can't hear you.

00:37.704 --> 00:40.238
I can't hear anything
you're saying.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.641
Speak up!
Louder!

00:42.643 --> 00:44.576
Ha ha ha!
Just kidding.

00:44.578 --> 00:47.946
This is an outgoing message,
and you just got pranked.

00:47.948 --> 00:49.280
Burn!

00:49.282 --> 00:52.450
Oh, man. Think how stupid
everyone will feel

00:52.452 --> 00:53.685
When they call us.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.053
Classic bit, huh?

00:55.055 --> 00:57.222
- Oh, yeah, classic.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.157
[beep]
this is bugs and daffy.

00:59.159 --> 01:01.226
We're not here.

01:21.881 --> 01:23.615
- [stammering] thanks for
getting us tickets, bugs.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.083
That was an amazing game.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.818
- I don't know
what you were watching,

01:26.820 --> 01:28.820
But to me,
they looked terrible.

01:28.822 --> 01:32.390
They were out of sync,
totally lackluster,
zero energy.

01:32.392 --> 01:34.492
It's like they never had
a single practice.

01:34.494 --> 01:36.961
- What are you talking about?
Our team won.

01:36.963 --> 01:38.496
- I'm not talking
about the players,

01:38.498 --> 01:40.465
I'm talking about
the cheerleaders.

01:40.467 --> 01:43.802
And I'm sorry,
if your back leg
isn't straight,

01:43.804 --> 01:46.337
It's not the splits.

01:46.339 --> 01:49.307
[beep]
- you have one new message.

01:49.309 --> 01:51.209
- Bugs, what's up, doc?

01:51.211 --> 01:52.844
It's me, rodney.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.512
- Rodney?
Who's rodney?

01:54.514 --> 01:57.115
- Shh.
- Hey, long time no talk, man.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.516
Listen, you're never
gonna believe it,

01:58.518 --> 01:59.617
But I'm gonna be
in town tomorrow.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.352
Let's get together,
all right?

02:01.354 --> 02:03.788
It's been too long
since I've seen my best friend.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.857
- Best friend?

02:05.859 --> 02:07.525
- Give me a call back.
[beep]

02:07.527 --> 02:08.660
- Who was that?

02:08.662 --> 02:09.494
- Rodney rabbit.

02:09.496 --> 02:10.829
He's an old friend of mine.

02:10.830 --> 02:13.932
- He seems to think
he's your best friend.

02:13.934 --> 02:15.834
- Oh, well, whatever.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.535
- What do you mean "whatever"?

02:17.537 --> 02:19.604
Either he's your
best friend of he's not.

02:19.606 --> 02:23.475
- Best friend.
Daffy, grownups don't
have best friends.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.110
You have a bunch of friends.

02:25.112 --> 02:28.713
Rodney's great.
You'll love him.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.317
- What are you doing?

02:32.319 --> 02:34.853
- Flushing this thing
down the toilet.

02:37.289 --> 02:39.958
- Man, bugs, you
haven't changed a bit.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.626
- So how did you guys meet?

02:41.628 --> 02:42.627
- Summer camp.

02:42.629 --> 02:43.695
- Lame.

02:43.697 --> 02:44.796
- Camp winninake.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.865
- Camp winninake?

02:46.867 --> 02:48.633
I went to camp winninake.

02:48.635 --> 02:51.136
- Oh, really?
I don't remember you there.

02:51.138 --> 02:52.504
What cabin were you in?

02:52.506 --> 02:54.439
We were cabin 7,
the sharks.

02:54.441 --> 02:57.408
- Oh, cabin 3,
the tadpoles.

02:57.410 --> 03:01.246
None of us could swim,
so we did a lot of
inside activities.

03:01.248 --> 03:03.615
- Ooh, man, I remember
the first day of camp.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.150
I didn't even want to
get off the bus.

03:05.152 --> 03:07.752
But then I met bugs
and we became best friends.

03:07.754 --> 03:09.020
- Ugh.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.055
- So how did you two meet?

03:11.057 --> 03:12.323
- Oh, well,
we met at the--

03:12.325 --> 03:13.391
- Just let me tell it, bugs.

03:13.393 --> 03:15.326
You always tell it wrong.

03:15.328 --> 03:17.762
We met during the war.

03:17.764 --> 03:22.600
I was in the navy.
A young captain stationed
on a submarine.

03:22.602 --> 03:25.570
- Captain, may I introduce
the new co-captain.

03:25.572 --> 03:28.206
- Bugs bunny.
- Daffy duck.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.808
[alarm sounds]
- what was that?

03:31.110 --> 03:33.678
Both: Giant sea turtle!

03:33.680 --> 03:40.218
- ¶ underwater team
in a submarine ¶

03:40.220 --> 03:44.055
- And we've been
best friends ever since.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.924
- That's a television show.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.392
We met at the post office.

03:47.394 --> 03:50.795
In fact, I remember
I was mailing you a letter.

03:55.334 --> 03:57.302
- Hey, man,
you got a stamp?

03:57.304 --> 04:01.105
- Uh, sure.

04:01.107 --> 04:03.575
- What else you got?

04:03.577 --> 04:06.911
- And he just kind of
never went away.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.146
- Hmmph!

04:08.148 --> 04:09.314
- Oh, hey, bugs.

04:09.316 --> 04:10.815
Remember that time
we were at the beach

04:10.817 --> 04:11.749
Trying to look all cool

04:11.751 --> 04:13.284
And that giant wave
knocked us over?

04:13.286 --> 04:15.653
[both laugh]

04:15.655 --> 04:18.456
- Remember that time we tried
to sneak into the rodeo

04:18.458 --> 04:20.257
And we got chased
by that bull?

04:20.260 --> 04:22.293
[both laugh]

04:22.295 --> 04:23.661
- Remember that time
those two guys

04:23.663 --> 04:25.697
Were talking about stuff
that nobody cared about?

04:25.699 --> 04:27.232
- Huh?
- Nothing.

04:27.234 --> 04:28.733
Porky and I have to go
to the bathroom.

04:28.735 --> 04:31.302
- I don't have to go
to the bathroom.

04:33.839 --> 04:34.873
Hey!

04:34.875 --> 04:36.541
- Now you do.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.943
Unbelievable, that guy.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.144
- Rodney?

04:40.146 --> 04:41.412
I think he's nice.

04:41.414 --> 04:43.648
- Not rodney.
Rodney's nothing.

04:43.650 --> 04:45.283
Rodney's less than nothing.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.651
I'm talking about bugs.

04:46.653 --> 04:49.487
He obviously considers
rodney his best friend.

04:49.489 --> 04:51.756
Who knows if I'm even
his second best friend.

04:51.758 --> 04:54.559
For all I know,
I'm his third best friend.

04:54.561 --> 04:57.328
I gotta do something
about this, fast.

04:57.330 --> 05:00.531
- So if bugs is
your best friend,

05:00.533 --> 05:03.201
Who's your second
best friend?

05:03.203 --> 05:04.302
- Tina.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.237
- Oh. Uh...

05:06.239 --> 05:08.172
- Third best friend--
big fat rooster.

05:08.174 --> 05:09.340
Fourth--speedy.

05:09.342 --> 05:11.175
Fifth--a tie between
pete the puma

05:11.177 --> 05:12.410
And marvin the martian.

05:12.412 --> 05:14.012
- I'm sixth?

05:14.014 --> 05:15.780
- No, carl is sixth.

05:15.782 --> 05:17.615
- Who's carl?

05:17.617 --> 05:19.817
- I don't know, some dude
I met in the phoenix airport.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.921
But you're definitely
my seventh best friend.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.590
- Oh, pardon me.

05:25.592 --> 05:28.226
- Well, that was
unexpectedly polite.

05:28.228 --> 05:30.795
You know what,
that guy is seventh.

05:30.797 --> 05:32.630
You're eighth.

05:32.632 --> 05:34.599
No, wait.
Granny is eighth.

05:34.601 --> 05:37.568
You're ninth.
Ooh, barely in
the top 10, porky.

05:37.570 --> 05:39.237
I'm surprised
we hang out at all.

05:39.239 --> 05:42.407
But keep trying,
anything's possible.

05:51.383 --> 05:53.484
- Hey, bugs, who am I?

05:53.486 --> 05:55.253
"hey, can I borrow
your towel?"

05:55.255 --> 05:56.821
[laughter]

05:56.823 --> 05:58.990
Ohh!

05:58.992 --> 06:00.925
Sorry, daffy.
Inside joke.

06:00.927 --> 06:02.327
[telephone rings]

06:02.329 --> 06:03.728
- Hey, will you get that?

06:03.730 --> 06:05.063
- Ha ha ha!

06:05.065 --> 06:06.898
Will you get that?
Ha ha ha!

06:06.900 --> 06:08.599
That's hilarious!

06:08.601 --> 06:10.868
Sorry, rodney,
you wouldn't get it.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.370
Ha ha ha!
[ring]

06:12.372 --> 06:15.139
It's an inside joke
between me and bugs.

06:15.141 --> 06:16.274
We got a ton of them.

06:16.276 --> 06:18.710
[ring]

06:18.712 --> 06:20.712
Hello?
- Hey, it's porky.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.081
You said to call
when I was out front.

06:27.086 --> 06:30.021
- Uh, I'm getting the mail.

06:31.023 --> 06:32.523
- Daffy reminds me of someone.

06:32.525 --> 06:35.393
- I've never met anybody
remotely like him.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.895
- Why'd you want to talk
to me in my car?

06:37.897 --> 06:41.766
- Because we need to speak
privately about a very
delicate matter.

06:41.768 --> 06:44.302
I need you to help me
get rid of rodney.

06:44.304 --> 06:46.804
- You mean murder?

06:46.806 --> 06:48.306
- What? No.

06:48.308 --> 06:49.907
I'm gonna make bugs jealous

06:49.909 --> 06:52.610
By pretending that
you and I are best friends

06:52.612 --> 06:55.880
So that he'll dump rodney
and make me his best friend.

06:56.949 --> 06:59.350
Or I guess we could go
with your murder idea.

06:59.352 --> 07:02.020
- I am not murdering anyone.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.955
- Well, don't make me
feel weird about it,

07:03.957 --> 07:04.922
You brought it up.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.025
- Why do you want
my help anyway?

07:07.027 --> 07:08.159
What about tina?

07:08.161 --> 07:10.395
Or the 7 other friends
above me?

07:10.397 --> 07:12.196
- Porky, porky, look.

07:12.198 --> 07:13.531
If you help me do this,

07:13.533 --> 07:16.467
I promise I will make you
my fifth best friend.

07:16.469 --> 07:17.502
That's a big jump.

07:17.504 --> 07:18.736
And think about it,

07:18.738 --> 07:21.139
If bugs, tina,
big fat rooster, and speedy

07:21.141 --> 07:22.607
Ever get abducted
by an alien,

07:22.609 --> 07:25.910
Then you would automatically
become my best friend.

07:25.912 --> 07:27.612
Unless the alien
was super cool,

07:27.614 --> 07:29.514
Then he'd be number one
and you'd be number two.

07:29.516 --> 07:31.516
Which is still miles above
where you are now.

07:31.518 --> 07:32.984
- Ok, I'll do it.

07:32.986 --> 07:36.054
- That's why you're
my ninth best friend.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.555
- [chuckles]

07:37.557 --> 07:40.158
So what's the plan?
- It's very simple.

07:40.160 --> 07:44.796
I'm going to use my patented
bomb, hook, and hammer.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.764
- What's the bomb,
hook, and hammer?

07:46.766 --> 07:49.033
- [scoffs] I happen to know
that bugs and rodney

07:49.035 --> 07:50.968
Are going to the movies
this afternoon.

07:50.970 --> 07:54.105
And if I know bugs,
and I do because
I'm his best friend,

07:54.107 --> 07:56.641
He'll ask if I'd like
to tag along.

07:56.643 --> 07:59.477
And this is where
I will drop the bomb.

07:59.479 --> 08:03.714
I will say no.

08:03.716 --> 08:05.783
I'll tell him that I can't
join them at the movies

08:05.785 --> 08:08.419
Because I have other plans.

08:08.421 --> 08:09.854
The hook.

08:09.856 --> 08:11.222
- What plans?

08:11.224 --> 08:13.858
- I'll tell them that
I'm already going to the movies

08:13.860 --> 08:17.195
With my best friend--
porky pig.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.063
The hammer.

08:19.065 --> 08:21.866
Bugs will be so jealous,
he'll kick rodney to the curb

08:21.868 --> 08:23.534
And beg me to be
his best friend.

08:23.536 --> 08:24.902
It's foolproof.

08:24.904 --> 08:26.471
- Ha ha ha!

08:26.473 --> 08:28.372
- Oh, hey, rodney and I
are going to the movies.

08:28.374 --> 08:30.842
You want to come?

08:30.844 --> 08:32.710
- No.

08:32.712 --> 08:35.379
- Ok.

08:35.381 --> 08:38.649
[engine starts]

08:38.650 --> 08:42.453
- I'd hate to be in that car
when that bomb goes off.

08:42.455 --> 08:45.990
Any second that bomb's
gonna go off

08:45.992 --> 08:47.892
And he's gonna slam
on the brakes,

08:47.894 --> 08:51.028
Throw it in reverse,
and plead for me
to take it back.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.664
It's gonna be so embarrassing
for him.

08:53.666 --> 08:56.501
Oh! There go the brakes.

08:56.503 --> 08:58.736
Nope, driving on.

08:58.738 --> 09:01.506
But the bomb will go off.

09:01.508 --> 09:05.176
We just have to wait.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.311
[dog barking
in distance]

09:07.313 --> 09:12.183
- I think I'm gonna
go home.

09:16.421 --> 09:20.558
- Any second.

09:27.566 --> 09:30.334
Hey, granny, let me know
if a bomb goes off.

09:30.336 --> 09:33.004
I'm gonna watch some tv.

09:36.375 --> 09:39.010
Ooh, my show.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.979
- Admiral craddleberg is
dropping depth chargers on us.

09:41.981 --> 09:45.316
- But we're allies.
He's supposed to be our friend.

09:49.087 --> 09:52.056
Captain, we're
running out of air.

09:52.058 --> 09:54.425
This is the end. Ohh.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.761
- Wait, the time vortex.

09:58.297 --> 10:00.798
- Of course,
the time vortex.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.901
We could go back in time
to before the attack.

10:03.903 --> 10:07.171
- No, no, we'll go back
even further than that.

10:07.173 --> 10:11.876
We'll go back to before
we ever even met
admiral craddleberg.

10:11.878 --> 10:13.811
- That's it.
I'll go back in time

10:13.813 --> 10:16.447
And stop bugs and rodney
from meeting in the first place.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.782
It's so simple.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.518
All I need is
a time vortex.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.053
- Well, what do you think,

10:22.055 --> 10:24.322
I keep a time vortex
in my closet?

10:24.324 --> 10:25.623
Well, I don't.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.592
It's in my garage.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.327
And you aren't allowed
to use it.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.761
Now, just get on out of here.

10:30.763 --> 10:33.598
Messing around with time travel
is serious business,

10:33.600 --> 10:35.466
Especially for
a fool like you.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.567
- [scoffs]

10:36.569 --> 10:38.202
- Oh, lord,
speaking of time,

10:38.204 --> 10:40.104
I'm gonna be late
for the pta meeting.

10:40.106 --> 10:42.940
Mmm. No time to take
the minivan.

10:47.279 --> 10:51.849
- I wonder how long
the average pta meeting is.

10:55.520 --> 10:58.356
I'll fix this window
when I get back.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.991
Whoa!

11:02.394 --> 11:03.794
Maybe the witch is right.

11:03.796 --> 11:05.896
Maybe I shouldn't
get involved with time travel.

11:05.898 --> 11:07.965
I mean, how does it
even work?

11:07.967 --> 11:09.834
What do I do,
just tell it

11:09.836 --> 11:11.535
To send me back in time
to the moment

11:11.537 --> 11:13.371
Before bugs and rodney meet?

11:13.373 --> 11:16.374
It can't be that simple.

11:16.376 --> 11:20.144
Aah!

11:26.918 --> 11:28.286
- Aah!

11:28.288 --> 11:30.154
Uhh!

11:30.156 --> 11:32.156
Where am I?

11:32.158 --> 11:33.557
Camp winninake!

11:33.559 --> 11:36.827
This is when bugs
and rodney first meet.

11:38.130 --> 11:39.997
Is that bugs?

11:39.999 --> 11:42.400
- Eh, what's up, doc?

11:42.402 --> 11:44.035
- That's bugs.

11:44.037 --> 11:44.935
- Bugs bunny?

11:44.937 --> 11:47.204
You're in cabin 7,
the sharks.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.440
- Now, where's that
little home wrecker rodney?

11:49.442 --> 11:52.476
[gasps]

11:52.478 --> 11:53.744
A-ha!

11:53.746 --> 11:57.014
Are you rodney rabbit?

11:57.016 --> 11:58.082
- Yes.

11:58.084 --> 12:00.584
- I'm the camp director,
chuck winninake.

12:00.586 --> 12:03.487
I'm afraid I have
some bad news.

12:03.489 --> 12:04.755
- What is it?

12:04.757 --> 12:07.425
- Well, unfortunately,
we're overbooked.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.459
- What does that mean?

12:08.461 --> 12:09.694
- It means there's no room

12:09.696 --> 12:10.895
For anymore campers.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.330
Sorry for the mix-up, kid,

12:12.332 --> 12:14.165
But it looks like you're
gonna have to turn around

12:14.167 --> 12:15.433
And go back home.

12:17.235 --> 12:18.703
Have a good summer!

12:18.705 --> 12:21.038
Away from bugs bunny.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.741
Now, where's that
time vortex?

12:25.310 --> 12:27.511
- Sir? Sir!

12:27.513 --> 12:29.480
Can you help me find
my cabin?

12:30.515 --> 12:31.716
Sir?

12:33.518 --> 12:36.387
Sir, cabin 3?

12:36.389 --> 12:37.788
- [gasps] porky?

12:37.790 --> 12:40.157
- Where are the other
camp halls?

12:40.159 --> 12:42.460
- But...

12:42.462 --> 12:44.462
- Is this cabin 3?

12:44.464 --> 12:46.464
- Just go knock on the door.

12:49.735 --> 12:52.303
[engine starts,
tires screech]

12:54.239 --> 12:55.373
- Hello.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.474
- Hi.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.142
- What's your name?

12:58.144 --> 13:00.644
- Porky.
What's yours?

13:00.646 --> 13:02.079
- Porky.

13:04.883 --> 13:07.251
- Hey. What's up, doc?

13:07.253 --> 13:08.753
- Excuse me?

13:08.755 --> 13:09.820
- What do you want
to do today?

13:09.822 --> 13:11.489
Movies, grab some lunch?

13:11.491 --> 13:13.557
- I'm sorry,
do I know you?

13:13.559 --> 13:16.794
- Ha ha.
It's me, daffy.

13:17.662 --> 13:19.463
Daffy duck.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.332
Your best friend.

13:21.334 --> 13:24.001
- I think you have me
confused with someone else.

13:24.003 --> 13:26.470
I've never seen you
before in my life.

13:28.707 --> 13:30.708
- How is this possible?

13:30.710 --> 13:32.576
I made is so bugs
doesn't know rodney,

13:32.578 --> 13:34.712
But why doesn't he know me?

13:34.714 --> 13:36.914
Granny!
You know me, right?

13:36.916 --> 13:38.783
It's me, daffy.

13:45.657 --> 13:47.024
Yosemite!

13:47.026 --> 13:48.526
What's going on?

13:50.429 --> 13:51.862
What happened?

13:51.864 --> 13:53.330
- I'll tell you
what happened.

13:53.332 --> 13:56.434
You broke into my garage
and messed with my time vortex.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.468
- You know me?

13:57.470 --> 13:59.770
- Child, I'm not
a witch for nothing.

13:59.772 --> 14:01.605
Come with me.

14:01.607 --> 14:04.775
- So what you're saying is
if bugs didn't ever meet rodney,

14:04.777 --> 14:07.778
Then he wouldn't have gone
to the post office
to mail him a letter.

14:07.780 --> 14:10.614
And if he didn't go
to the post office
to mail him a letter--

14:10.616 --> 14:13.584
- That's right,
you don't ever meet bugs.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.553
So you got to undo
what you done.

14:15.555 --> 14:18.022
Or redo what you didn't do.

14:18.024 --> 14:21.125
You mess with time,
it all gets so confusing.

14:21.127 --> 14:22.426
- Uhh!

14:23.595 --> 14:24.862
[gasps]

14:24.864 --> 14:26.897
Ok, where are they?

14:26.899 --> 14:29.433
There's bugs.
Where's rodney?

14:29.435 --> 14:31.235
[engine roaring]

14:32.771 --> 14:34.505
Oh, no, I'm too late.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.474
Stop! Stop!

14:48.787 --> 14:51.455
- [growls]

14:59.664 --> 15:01.932
- Stop!

15:01.934 --> 15:03.334
- Mr. Winninake?

15:03.336 --> 15:05.503
- Call me chuck.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.438
There was a clerical error.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.508
Turns out there
is room at the camp.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.610
You're in cabin 7.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.278
You're a shark.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.480
- Actually, I don't think
I want to go to camp.

15:16.482 --> 15:17.982
Is it ok if I just go home?

15:17.984 --> 15:19.817
- No! I mean, you can't.

15:19.819 --> 15:22.119
- I didn't really want to
go to camp in the first place.

15:22.121 --> 15:23.621
I don't know anyone here.

15:23.623 --> 15:24.955
I don't have any friends.

15:24.957 --> 15:27.424
- You don't yet,
but you will.

15:27.426 --> 15:32.229
In fact, I can guarantee
that you're about to meet
a really great friend.

15:32.231 --> 15:33.764
- Will he be my best friend?

15:33.766 --> 15:36.100
- You know, it's funny.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.102
Grownups don't have
best friends.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.004
You're friends with
a bunch of people.

15:40.006 --> 15:42.640
And the more you have,
the better.

15:52.651 --> 15:55.386
- By the way, I lied.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.521
Grownups do have
best friends,

15:57.523 --> 16:00.424
And he's gonna be mine!

16:04.029 --> 16:06.764
- The carrot peeler
paid for all of this?

16:06.766 --> 16:08.365
Man, I gotta invent something.

16:08.367 --> 16:09.934
- Bugs! Bugs!

16:09.936 --> 16:12.202
[gasps] bugs.

16:12.204 --> 16:14.638
I'm so happy to see you.

16:15.840 --> 16:18.242
And, rodney,
get in here.

16:18.244 --> 16:20.778
I'm just so glad
you guys are friends.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.947
- Uh, do I know you?

16:22.949 --> 16:25.549
- Oh, no, no,
it still didn't work.

16:25.551 --> 16:29.019
- Well, I've just never
seen you act this nice before.

16:29.021 --> 16:30.688
- Oh, thank goodness.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.323
- Oh, wait a second.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.958
I know who you
remind me of.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.460
Our camp director,
chuck winninake.

16:36.462 --> 16:37.494
- Chuck winninake?

16:37.496 --> 16:39.863
Our camp director
was edward hart.

16:39.865 --> 16:42.199
- What? No!
You remember him?

16:42.201 --> 16:45.102
Chuck winninake.
He looked just like daffy.

16:45.104 --> 16:46.637
- I don't remember that.

16:46.639 --> 16:47.972
- You know what,

16:47.974 --> 16:50.341
What do you say we just
enjoy the present, huh?

16:50.343 --> 16:52.776
Let the past stay
in the past.

16:52.778 --> 16:54.545
[gasps]
little porky.

16:54.547 --> 16:57.247
[shudders]

17:04.888 --> 17:08.858
- ¶ well, long eared drifter
riding cross the plain ¶

17:08.861 --> 17:13.030
¶ nobody'd ever seen him,
nobody knew his name ¶

17:13.031 --> 17:14.932
¶ when he stormed into town

17:14.934 --> 17:19.303
¶ and reached for
some filtered water ¶

17:21.740 --> 17:24.907
¶ and come carrot neeblers

17:24.910 --> 17:27.911
¶ well, a pretty little filly
stopped the stranger ¶

17:27.913 --> 17:31.115
¶ and she said,
step into my saloon ¶

17:31.117 --> 17:32.850
¶ and rest your weary head

17:32.852 --> 17:35.486
¶ but the stranger just
shook his head and said ¶

17:35.488 --> 17:38.789
¶ I'll have a nicoise salad

17:38.791 --> 17:41.425
¶ 'cause there's good carbs
and bad carbs ¶

17:41.427 --> 17:43.227
¶ and every cowboy knows

17:43.229 --> 17:45.295
¶ the carbs from fruits
and vegetables ¶

17:45.297 --> 17:47.231
¶ will help you
fit your clothes ¶

17:47.233 --> 17:49.833
¶ speaking of which,
I'm gonna need ¶

17:49.835 --> 17:52.803
¶ some more carrot neeblers

17:52.805 --> 17:57.374
¶ then he saw black bart
standing in the sunrise ¶

17:57.376 --> 18:00.678
¶ he had gristle in his teeth
and diabetes in his eyes ¶

18:00.680 --> 18:03.814
¶ and he said, bart,
you and me's gonna square off ¶

18:03.816 --> 18:07.551
¶ over a yogurt parfait

18:07.553 --> 18:10.888
¶ but bart scooped up the woman
and he took off riding hard ¶

18:10.890 --> 18:14.825
¶ he took her to
a taco stand that makes
everything with lard ¶

18:14.827 --> 18:18.829
¶ he ordered 16 tacos made
with bullets, beef, and flour ¶

18:18.831 --> 18:22.866
¶ he said, girl, you're
gonna eat these even if
it takes an hour ¶

18:22.868 --> 18:26.704
¶ well, that's when
that old stranger
came riding up fast ¶

18:26.706 --> 18:30.841
¶ his dismounted his pony
and took a shot of wheatgrass ¶

18:30.843 --> 18:34.878
¶ this taco party's over,
said the stranger with a draw ¶

18:34.880 --> 18:39.316
¶ you eat that junk,
you'll jack up your
bad cholesterol ¶

18:39.318 --> 18:41.885
¶ and one more thing, buddy

18:41.887 --> 18:44.855
¶ you forgot your parfait

18:44.857 --> 18:49.560
¶ 'cause when you're
fighting evil, every
healthy cowboy knows ¶

18:49.562 --> 18:52.863
¶ you gotta keep your
blood sugar from
getting too low ¶

18:52.865 --> 18:55.566
¶ 'cause if you don't,
you better know, joe ¶

18:55.568 --> 18:58.969
¶ you're gonna get
real sleepy ¶

18:58.971 --> 19:03.006
¶ well, bart just laughed
and said, I don't need
that trash ¶

19:03.008 --> 19:07.177
¶ I live on steak and ice cream,
corned beef hash ¶

19:07.179 --> 19:09.279
¶ and I'd mow you down
right now ¶

19:09.281 --> 19:12.649
¶ if I wasn't feeling
so sluggish ¶

19:12.651 --> 19:15.486
¶ the stranger pushed
that parfait towards him ¶

19:15.488 --> 19:16.920
¶ and he stared bart down

19:16.922 --> 19:21.158
¶ and a hush and a chill
fell across the town ¶

19:21.160 --> 19:23.660
¶ and everybody froze
as bart reached ¶

19:23.662 --> 19:27.064
¶ and took a bite
of his parfait ¶

19:27.066 --> 19:29.099
¶ well, bart's cheeks
got rosy ¶

19:29.101 --> 19:30.968
¶ and his hair regained
its sheen ¶

19:30.970 --> 19:35.305
¶ he said, it's my sugar intake
that's been making me so mean ¶

19:35.307 --> 19:37.441
¶ speaking of which,
stranger, won't you share ¶

19:37.443 --> 19:40.811
¶ some of those carrot
neeblers ¶

19:40.813 --> 19:45.415
¶ and now two cowboys ride
across that dusty land ¶

19:45.417 --> 19:48.819
¶ vanquishing darkness
and eating oat bran ¶

19:48.821 --> 19:51.455
¶ and one thing
you better understand, man ¶

19:51.457 --> 19:55.592
¶ they hardly ever
get sleepy ¶

19:57.529 --> 20:01.765
¶ they also enjoy stir-fry

20:03.501 --> 20:08.205
¶ they carefully control
their portions ¶

20:09.574 --> 20:13.644
¶ and they keep food journals

20:15.814 --> 20:18.415
¶ and they share
their neeblers ¶

20:18.417 --> 20:28.292
- ¶ healthy cowboys

20:37.168 --> 20:38.368
- Well, this is it.

20:38.370 --> 20:40.404
- Which one's my cabin?

20:40.406 --> 20:41.872
- They're right over there.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.941
You're a tadpole.

20:44.976 --> 20:46.476
- Wait.

20:46.478 --> 20:48.412
No, you're over there.

20:48.414 --> 20:50.614
Cabin 7, the sharks.

20:50.616 --> 20:54.351
- No, I'm not.
I mean, no, he's not.

20:54.353 --> 20:56.820
- You're gonna be
with the cool kids.

20:56.822 --> 20:57.988
- I am?

20:57.990 --> 20:59.223
- You can do it.

20:59.225 --> 21:01.959
Who knows, maybe one day
you'll grow up

To be my second best friend.

- Hi.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.600
- Thanks, daffy.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.736
I like being your
second best friend.

the witch to let me use
her time vortex.

Yeah, I probably should
make her my second best friend.

Kidding!
