-Matt, stop doing cocaine.
-He won't let me.

00:45.567 --> 00:46.872
What happened to your brother?

00:47.047 --> 00:49.701
I told you, he's...
there's damage

00:49.875 --> 00:50.963
to the lining of his aorta.

00:51.138 --> 00:52.400

00:52.574 --> 00:54.184
A few more days and you run off?

Matthew's dead.

01:51.328 --> 01:53.113
It was a heart attack.

01:53.287 --> 01:55.202
Not that you couldn't
have guessed that.

01:57.117 --> 02:01.121
Okay... I can be on a flight

02:01.295 --> 02:03.427

There he is.
-Detective Stern.

06:02.884 --> 06:04.233
How's it going, Franklin?

06:06.844 --> 06:08.716
Looks like you still got
a pretty good limp there.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.021
Yeah, don't get shot.

06:10.195 --> 06:11.893
Yeah, good advice.

06:12.067 --> 06:14.199
I'll have to keep that in mind.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.507
It's a little early for a drink.

06:17.681 --> 06:19.596
Y'all want to come back
a little later?

06:19.770 --> 06:21.729
-I'd be happy to hook it up.
-Great.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.350
Sorry.

06:36.613 --> 06:39.790
This could be really easy
on you.

06:39.964 --> 06:43.098
You just tell me where he is,
I'll leave you alone,

06:43.272 --> 06:44.578
let you go about your day.

06:44.752 --> 06:47.494
I'd help you out

06:47.668 --> 06:48.843
but I don't know
who you're talking about.

06:49.017 --> 06:50.845
Oh, come...

06:55.110 --> 06:56.503
Okay.

06:56.677 --> 06:57.852
Hand over those keys.

06:58.026 --> 06:59.506
Let me see
what you got in the car.

07:01.029 --> 07:02.770
Go ahead, give it to him.

07:18.742 --> 07:20.744
Hmm.

07:22.093 --> 07:25.314
You want to run us in
for excessive bass?

07:25.488 --> 07:27.316
I can take you in
any time I want

07:27.490 --> 07:30.188
for any reason I want.

07:30.362 --> 07:32.408
A little girl is dead.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.890
Somebody gonna
have to pay for it.

07:37.413 --> 07:38.936
-I'll see you soon.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.615
What's happening?

08:08.009 --> 08:09.750
What's all that banging?

08:11.665 --> 08:13.362
Y'all doing some redecorating?

08:13.536 --> 08:15.016
Man, he think that ever since

08:15.190 --> 08:16.713
he hung your boy up
on that cross

08:16.887 --> 08:19.107
God done had it out for us
or something.

08:21.762 --> 08:23.764
I fucked up, man.

08:25.766 --> 08:28.203
And he gonna keep punishing us

08:28.377 --> 08:30.814
and taking our people
if I don't repent.

08:33.164 --> 08:35.210
He back up on that sherm
already, huh?

08:35.384 --> 08:37.342
Nigga, I'm not high.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.301
All right.

08:39.475 --> 08:42.739
I'm telling you, man,
we're being judged.

08:42.913 --> 08:46.047
By forces that's not
of this earth, man.

08:47.091 --> 08:49.006
As you can see, this nigga
ain't been no bit of help,

08:49.180 --> 08:50.834
so what's up?

08:51.008 --> 08:52.619
You got something for me?

08:52.793 --> 08:54.229
I've been trying, Dij.

08:54.403 --> 08:55.883
Ain't nobody seen Leon.

08:56.057 --> 08:57.972
-No one know where he at.

08:58.146 --> 08:59.887
Man, if you was half
as interested in finding Leon

09:00.061 --> 09:01.584
as you are in finding
Franklin's fucking plug,

09:01.758 --> 09:03.455
you know I'd have
that nigga head by now.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.893
Hey, look, that ain't got
nothing to do with this.

09:06.067 --> 09:08.243
Tianna my blood, too.
We'll make sure them niggas pay.

09:08.417 --> 09:11.202
But you just got to be patient.

09:13.291 --> 09:16.033
Both of y'all some
sorry-ass motherfuckers.

09:17.905 --> 09:19.559
How you holding up?

09:19.733 --> 09:22.039
Losing my fucking mind.

09:23.737 --> 09:25.608
What's going on out there?

09:25.782 --> 09:28.219
Heat dying down?

09:28.393 --> 09:29.917
Nah.

09:30.091 --> 09:32.746
Got to give the cops something.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.922
Get 'em off our backs,

09:35.096 --> 09:37.054
murder off the board.

09:38.752 --> 09:41.406
-I could do the stretch.
-Nah.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.018
I need you out
and free to operate,

09:44.192 --> 09:46.455
move rock in the projects.

09:50.807 --> 09:52.722
So, what you saying?

10:00.338 --> 10:02.079
Nah, fuck that.

10:02.253 --> 10:03.515
Ain't got a choice.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.256
I pulled the trigger.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.781
He a soldier, Lee.

10:07.955 --> 10:09.826
He'll understand.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.786
The people I done before this
had it coming, but this, Saint?

10:12.960 --> 10:14.483
Accident.

10:14.657 --> 10:16.267
That shit don't fucking matter.

10:16.441 --> 10:18.443
-Of course it does.
-No, the fuck it don't.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.445
It does.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.318
Because the truth
of the matter is

10:23.492 --> 10:26.103
they never should have had
that girl in the car.

10:26.277 --> 10:27.931
So it ain't on you.

10:28.105 --> 10:30.630
This shit is on me.

10:30.804 --> 10:32.762
Look...

10:35.460 --> 10:38.115
We'll take care of his family,

10:38.289 --> 10:40.727
make sure he's set
when he gets out.

10:40.901 --> 10:42.685
I promise.

10:42.859 --> 10:45.906
But if you have any idea
where Fatback's holed up at,

10:46.080 --> 10:47.908
then I need to know.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.709
Thought you said
your girl was a shark?

11:06.883 --> 11:09.581
No, what I said was
she used to run shit.

11:09.756 --> 11:12.019
Run shit into
the goddamn ground.

11:12.193 --> 11:13.890
Jerome.
-What?

11:14.064 --> 11:16.588
How we gonna set up
a pipeline out here?

11:16.763 --> 11:18.765
Come on. You'll see.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.378
Overdressed like a motherfucker.

11:23.552 --> 11:26.511
Egypt!

11:31.691 --> 11:33.954
Oh, it's so good
to see you, honey.

11:34.128 --> 11:36.043
It's good to see you.

11:36.217 --> 11:37.697
Ey, you must be Jerome.

11:37.871 --> 11:40.264
So nice to meet you
after all these years.

11:40.438 --> 11:42.658
This my husband Johnny.

11:42.832 --> 11:44.486
Welcome.
Glad to know y'all.

11:46.009 --> 11:48.708
And this my baby.
Alisha, come here

11:48.882 --> 11:51.058
-and meet your Auntie Louie.
-Oh.

11:51.232 --> 11:52.537
We known each other

11:52.712 --> 11:54.191
-since we was your age.
-Really?

11:54.365 --> 11:55.889
Uh-huh.
She a little shy.

11:56.063 --> 11:59.109
Oh, she's a cutie-pie. Hi!

11:59.283 --> 12:01.068
And you didn't tell me
you was having another one.

12:01.242 --> 12:03.200
What you mean?
I ain't pregnant.

12:07.161 --> 12:09.206
-Oh, bitch!

12:09.380 --> 12:11.774
-Should've seen your face!
-Los Angeles

12:11.948 --> 12:13.776
in the house.

12:13.950 --> 12:16.083
Y'all the ones come out here
to make us rich?

12:16.257 --> 12:17.824
This Sharles.

12:17.998 --> 12:19.564
He don't have much of what
you might call a filter.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.176
I ain't got much
of anything, but...

12:22.350 --> 12:24.439
-still fly.
-Sharles,

12:24.613 --> 12:27.616
carry them children on down
to Mae's for a little bit now.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.009
I ain't no damn babysitter.

12:29.183 --> 12:30.793
Nigga, you sleeping
on our couch.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.882
You're whatever the hell
I need you to be. Now go on.

12:33.056 --> 12:34.014
-Motherfucker.

12:34.188 --> 12:36.451
Damn.
Whatever y'all packing,

12:36.625 --> 12:38.192
I need a taste when I get back.

12:38.366 --> 12:39.759
Come on, children.
Damn.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.630
-Girl, come on.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.588
-You look so good.
-Thank you, girl.

12:43.763 --> 12:44.894
Oh, my God, them rings.
Oh, my God.

12:51.553 --> 12:52.772
Man...

12:52.946 --> 12:54.425
it's so good to see y'all, man,

12:54.599 --> 12:56.601
and get some decent
goddamn food.

12:58.212 --> 13:00.954
Leon says this is, uh,
your cousin's place?

13:01.128 --> 13:03.260
Mm-hmm.
On my mama's side.

13:03.434 --> 13:05.785
I ain't heard much from
the outside world. What...

13:05.959 --> 13:08.396
Things cooling down
or what's going on?

13:08.570 --> 13:10.050
That's why we're here, actually.

13:10.224 --> 13:11.660
Okay.

13:11.834 --> 13:14.228
Yeah, so-so we good?
Get to go home?

13:17.492 --> 13:18.667
Afraid not.

13:19.973 --> 13:22.584
'Cause we need you to take
the rap on this one, Fatback.

13:29.156 --> 13:31.288
We got the best lawyer there is.

13:31.462 --> 13:34.030
You gonna surrender,
admit you was there,

13:34.204 --> 13:36.641
but it was Eager Kid
who pulled the trigger.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.600
Let 'em make an example of you.

13:38.774 --> 13:40.907
Give them a reason
to call off the dogs.

13:41.081 --> 13:43.257
You'll get accessory, weapons,

13:43.431 --> 13:45.085
fleeing the scene,
shit like that.

13:45.259 --> 13:47.043
Turning yourself in,

13:47.217 --> 13:50.133
Prentice thinks we could
avoid a murder charge.

13:52.266 --> 13:54.355
If he wrong?

13:54.529 --> 13:57.184
They'll give my Black ass
50 years.

13:57.358 --> 13:59.316
And motherfuckers that kill kids

13:59.490 --> 14:01.666

Why cook it?
We could just sell that.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.403
Mm-mmm.
Rock is cheaper,

16:09.577 --> 16:11.535
more addictive
and the margins are better.

16:11.709 --> 16:13.668
The margins, huh?

Hey, come on.

The job at Walmart
or the Piggly Wiggly?

16:27.421 --> 16:28.944
Stop.

16:29.118 --> 16:30.946
You got a house,

16:31.120 --> 16:33.166
-a good man, a beautiful family.

16:33.340 --> 16:35.472
Johnny on the road
half the time.

16:35.646 --> 16:37.126
When he is here,

16:37.300 --> 16:40.042
he aggravated as a motherfucker
and I get it.

16:40.216 --> 16:42.392
How you supposed to feel
like a man, you can't provide

16:42.566 --> 16:44.829
-for your own family?
-Can't be easy.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.180
Not like millions of dollars,

16:47.354 --> 16:49.660

16:49.834 --> 16:51.706
-We always talked about it,

16:51.880 --> 16:53.534

-Mm-hmm.

What about moving it?

17:03.544 --> 17:05.459
Yeah, just like weed.

17:07.156 --> 17:09.332
Got to be careful who you trust.

17:09.506 --> 17:12.205
Put a little distance
between you and the street.

Ey.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.524
You can never smoke that.

18:54.698 --> 18:56.657
None of y'all.

18:56.831 --> 18:58.789
Cocaine is okay.

18:58.963 --> 19:01.531
Rock is not.

19:01.705 --> 19:04.447
How I'm supposed to sell it
if I don't know what it is?

19:04.621 --> 19:06.014
Tell them it's better than sex.

19:06.188 --> 19:08.582
Sex with me?

19:08.756 --> 19:10.758
-Or sex with you?
-Now hold on, hold on, hold on.

19:12.412 --> 19:14.588
What you mean,
we can't smoke it?

19:14.762 --> 19:16.546
How this thing hook you

19:16.720 --> 19:20.246

including heroin.

19:21.290 --> 19:23.858

19:24.032 --> 19:26.643
Man, y'all ain't no fun.

19:27.731 --> 19:30.169
This ain't about no fun.

19:30.343 --> 19:31.996
This is business.

19:34.042 --> 19:35.783
What is it exactly
you bringing in here,

19:35.957 --> 19:37.524

19:37.698 --> 19:39.874

worse than heroin and shit.

19:40.048 --> 19:41.571
Ey, my girl wouldn't

19:41.745 --> 19:43.182
bring in nothing
we couldn't handle.

19:44.661 --> 19:45.967
You sure about that?

19:46.141 --> 19:47.969
You said it yourself,

19:48.143 --> 19:49.884
she was the wild one,
got you in the most trouble

19:50.058 --> 19:52.016
-you ever been in.
-When we was kids.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.714
Yeah, well, it don't seem
like much changed to me, baby.

19:53.888 --> 19:56.151
Now, shoot me straight.

19:56.325 --> 19:59.198
I get involved with this rock,
what's coming to me?

19:59.372 --> 20:01.287
Long as you smart,

20:01.461 --> 20:04.028

20:04.203 --> 20:05.508
you'll be fine.

20:06.727 --> 20:09.120
We got to do something, baby.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.384
Can't keep going on like this.

20:11.558 --> 20:13.473
At least pay off
some of our debt,

20:13.647 --> 20:15.823
get you your own rig.

20:17.085 --> 20:21.350
We work too hard
to be drowning like we are.

20:42.197 --> 20:44.678
No, no, Hey.

20:46.114 --> 20:48.072
Go ahead with that.

20:51.772 --> 20:53.774
Go on now. Go on.

20:55.689 --> 20:58.344
Come on over here,
hot chocolate.

20:58.518 --> 21:01.564
Ah, sit with me, girl.

21:01.738 --> 21:03.566
Nice and warm.

21:43.954 --> 21:45.565
Evening, sir.

21:45.739 --> 21:47.175
You know what though. I mean,

21:47.349 --> 21:48.611
that-that's gonna happen
every time.

21:48.785 --> 21:50.613
I know...

21:52.006 --> 21:54.487
First he came in asking
for Louie, then for you.

21:54.661 --> 21:56.358
It's okay.
You did the right thing.

21:56.532 --> 21:58.926
He's fuckin' tripping, Franklin.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.232
Hey, Reed.

22:01.407 --> 22:02.495
What's going on?

22:02.669 --> 22:04.714
Aw, you know, just...

22:04.888 --> 22:06.716
sitting around.

22:06.890 --> 22:09.153
-I was wondering
how you're getting along.
-Well, I see

22:09.328 --> 22:10.416
you got yourself a drink.

22:10.590 --> 22:11.895
Why don't you come on up
to my office.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.726
You know, word on the street is,

22:16.900 --> 22:19.903
you still got these cops
all over your ass.

22:20.077 --> 22:22.863
And you're missing drops.

22:23.037 --> 22:25.169
-The fuck's the story with that?
-Yeah, look,

22:25.344 --> 22:26.649
it's all under control.

22:26.823 --> 22:29.130
Oh. Just 'cause
the last time we talked,

22:29.304 --> 22:31.132
you told me you're about ready
to hand over

22:31.306 --> 22:33.613
this-this little idiot
fucking friend of yours.

22:33.787 --> 22:36.485
Yeah, yeah,
I decided I had a better way.

22:38.487 --> 22:39.706
Don't worry, everybody,

22:39.880 --> 22:42.578
'cause Franklin Saint's
got a better way.

22:42.752 --> 22:45.102
I thought
you were smarter than this.

22:45.276 --> 22:47.409
-At what?
-At letting your little feelings
get in the way

22:47.583 --> 22:48.541
of what needs to be done.

22:48.715 --> 22:50.673
Leon is a brother to me, okay?

22:50.847 --> 22:52.806
Can't just fucking serve him up.

22:52.980 --> 22:57.201
You don't think
we've all sacrificed?

22:57.376 --> 23:02.032
You don't think we've all
lost people we care about?

23:03.077 --> 23:04.034
Look...

23:04.208 --> 23:06.210
look, I hear you, all right?

23:06.385 --> 23:09.257
I do.
And I'm taking care of this.

23:09.431 --> 23:12.782
So how about you just
head on home, sleep this off?

23:12.956 --> 23:16.046
How about you stop fucking up,
I'll stop showing up.

23:22.836 --> 23:24.403
You know, Franklin...

23:26.753 --> 23:30.452
...everybody is replaceable.

23:30.626 --> 23:33.542
And I mean
everybody is replaceable.

23:36.327 --> 23:39.113
So don't forget that.

23:53.475 --> 23:55.434
I still don't know
why we couldn't stay

23:55.608 --> 23:58.567
-at no goddamn hotel.
-Southern hospitality, Jerome.

23:58.741 --> 24:01.657
-By hospitality, you mean...

24:01.831 --> 24:04.181
freezing my ass off
and dealing with this bed?

24:04.355 --> 24:06.270
Try making the best of it.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.837
Oh, I'm gonna make the best

24:08.011 --> 24:10.318
of being stuck out in the middle
of bumfuck nowhere,

24:10.492 --> 24:12.407
freezing my ass off.

24:12.581 --> 24:14.453
Could you keep your voice down?

24:14.627 --> 24:16.455
How you look these people
in the face

24:16.629 --> 24:20.110
-and you just lie to 'em?
-Excuse me?

24:20.284 --> 24:22.591
You about to drop napalm
on these people,

24:22.765 --> 24:24.288
and you ain't
even gonna warn 'em.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.855
You don't know that.

24:26.029 --> 24:27.988
-I don't know?
-No. 'Cause this ain't L.A.

24:28.162 --> 24:31.121
It ain't no damn gangs
in little-ass Little Rock.

24:31.295 --> 24:33.994
And it wasn't no Uzis, either,
till you showed up.

24:34.168 --> 24:36.475
You tell yourself
whatever the fuck you want.

24:36.649 --> 24:38.694
You're about to get these people
killed or make 'em into killers.

24:38.868 --> 24:40.130
I promise you that.

24:40.304 --> 24:42.306
Not everybody
who gets in this game

24:42.481 --> 24:44.831
ends up dropping bodies, Jerome.

24:47.442 --> 24:50.663
We got in this game
to get rich, right?

24:50.837 --> 24:52.316
Right?

24:53.753 --> 24:55.581
Louie...

24:55.755 --> 24:57.234

24:57.408 --> 25:00.803
You got cars, you got clothes,
you got jewelry.

25:01.848 --> 25:03.806
You even got
that club you wanted.

25:03.980 --> 25:05.634
The fuck else you need?!

25:07.375 --> 25:09.943
It's not just about what I need.

25:10.117 --> 25:12.815
Then what is it about,
then, Cleopatra?

25:19.996 --> 25:21.563
What are you doing?

25:21.737 --> 25:23.130
I'm leaving.

25:23.304 --> 25:25.741
You going back to L.A.?

25:25.915 --> 25:28.135

I just know he was transferred
from CYA to Chino, right?

29:57.796 --> 30:00.320
Wondered how he's getting along.

30:00.494 --> 30:02.757
Not so good.

30:02.931 --> 30:04.846
I mean, he's terrified.

30:05.020 --> 30:06.805
He's just a boy.

30:06.979 --> 30:09.938
Shouldn't be in that place.

30:10.112 --> 30:13.376
It hurts my heart

30:13.550 --> 30:15.596
Hmm.

30:17.119 --> 30:19.469

30:28.739 --> 30:29.915
Appreciate the offer,

30:30.089 --> 30:32.091
-but I don't want that from you.
-Mm.

30:33.135 --> 30:36.008
My job here is plenty.

30:36.182 --> 30:38.967
-I can handle the rest.
-Mm.

30:43.711 --> 30:45.365
I got a question for you,

30:45.539 --> 30:48.324
-if we're asking questions now.
-Mm-hmm.

30:49.412 --> 30:51.588
That man who was here
the other night,

30:51.762 --> 30:53.721
what's his story?

30:54.809 --> 30:58.291
-Just a man I do business with.
-Mm.

30:58.465 --> 31:01.468
-Had a little too much to drink.
-Mm-hmm.

31:07.343 --> 31:08.692

31:37.460 --> 31:39.506
Franklin, did you post his bail?

31:41.421 --> 31:42.552
Did I...

31:42.726 --> 31:43.727
No.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.555
No. No, no, no.

31:45.729 --> 31:47.383
I gave you the fuckin' money.
What you talking about?

31:47.557 --> 31:50.212
<i>Well, I just went down to do it, to post it,</i>

31:50.386 --> 31:52.301

your man was already out.

<i>Are you sure one of your crew,</i>

31:55.696 --> 31:57.524

31:57.698 --> 31:59.787
Well, of course
I'm fucking sure.

33:19.040 --> 33:22.348

38:41.884 --> 38:45.627
Contra forces in the south
have been pushed back.

38:45.801 --> 38:47.629
They're losing ground.

38:47.803 --> 38:50.023

shipment of weapons?

38:50.197 --> 38:52.895

Hey, for what it's worth,

38:55.855 --> 38:57.683
our initial workup

38:57.857 --> 39:01.513
didn't reveal
any large personal deposits.

39:04.516 --> 39:07.388
We need to keep supplies moving.

39:07.562 --> 39:11.697
Additional ground support

39:11.871 --> 39:13.699
So, you get me
the operational details,

39:13.873 --> 39:16.528
-I can jump in and backstop...
-I'll take care of it.

39:16.702 --> 39:18.704

39:18.878 --> 39:21.271

39:38.593 --> 39:41.422
-I think I have to go
down there.

39:41.596 --> 39:44.860
Panama.
Maybe Nicaragua, too.

39:45.948 --> 39:48.821
You take care of things here

39:50.388 --> 39:52.390
Your brother died?

40:41.308 --> 40:43.441
<i>Was it quick?</i>

40:43.615 --> 40:45.268

Man, fuck!

40:48.010 --> 40:50.099
Fuck!

40:50.273 --> 40:51.884
We looked him in his face

40:52.058 --> 40:53.842
and told him everything
was gonna be all right!

40:54.016 --> 40:56.410

girl. You look pretty good.

41:32.838 --> 41:35.884
You got something
you can help me out with?

41:36.058 --> 41:37.930
No.

41:39.932 --> 41:41.934
I'm off that shit.

41:43.936 --> 41:45.503

41:53.162 --> 41:54.990
-Hey.
-Hi.

41:55.164 --> 41:57.384
-I need help.
Hey.

41:57.558 --> 41:59.821
Can I help you?

41:59.995 --> 42:01.693

42:01.867 --> 42:03.129
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

42:03.303 --> 42:05.784
Well, you'll be all right.

42:05.958 --> 42:07.394
It's safe here.

42:07.568 --> 42:09.701
-Uh, what's your name?
-Wanda Bell.

42:09.875 --> 42:11.441
Okay, Ms. Bell.

42:11.616 --> 42:13.356
Why don't you come on
around here and take a seat.

42:13.531 --> 42:16.882
Ms. Tammy
will get you signed in.

42:17.056 --> 42:19.972
And, uh,
you come to the right place.

42:20.146 --> 42:23.628
-Hmm? Yeah.

42:23.802 --> 42:25.804
You have any questions,
just ask.

42:27.588 --> 42:29.547
Thought I made myself
perfectly clear

42:29.721 --> 42:30.983
last time you was here.

42:31.157 --> 42:33.899
Leave now
or I will call the police.

42:34.073 --> 42:35.727
Okay.

42:35.901 --> 42:37.424
And when they get here,

42:37.598 --> 42:39.078
should I tell them
the shelter's being funded

42:39.252 --> 42:41.384
by your son's drug money,
or would you like to?

42:41.559 --> 42:43.604
Uh,

42:43.778 --> 42:46.172
Ms. Tammy, excuse me.
One second, please.

42:47.216 --> 42:49.828
That's a slanderous accusation.

42:50.002 --> 42:52.526
Legally actionable,
if you ain't got proof.

42:52.700 --> 42:54.354
I've got proof of everything,
Alton.

42:54.528 --> 42:56.704
Your son, your wife,

42:56.878 --> 42:59.533
hell, what your entire
family's into.

42:59.707 --> 43:01.840
But here's the thing.

43:02.014 --> 43:05.539
I've also got proof
about who's really behind it.

43:05.713 --> 43:07.889
CIA.

43:09.935 --> 43:11.763
I don't want to hurt you
or your family.

43:11.937 --> 43:15.070
I want the ones
bringing the stuff in.

43:16.550 --> 43:18.683
You need to leave.

43:18.857 --> 43:20.206
Come on.

43:20.380 --> 43:22.251
Isn't this
what the Panthers fought for?

43:22.425 --> 43:25.211
What Fred Hampton died for?

43:25.385 --> 43:28.431
Exposing and taking down
the corrupt U.S. government?

43:28.606 --> 43:31.130
If you know so much, then why
are you here bothering me?

43:31.304 --> 43:34.437
I need it on the record
from someone who's in it.

43:34.612 --> 43:37.223
Tell me what you know.
Help me make this story,

43:37.397 --> 43:39.268
and I'll spare your family.

43:39.442 --> 43:41.836
Refuse?

43:42.010 --> 43:45.057
I focus on your wife and son
and this place,

43:45.231 --> 43:46.624
and you all burn.

43:48.713 --> 43:49.975
I'll be back tomorrow.

43:51.019 --> 43:53.979
Hope by then
you've made the right choice.
