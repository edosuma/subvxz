00:06.339 --> 00:11.261
In the aftermath of a trauma,
the human body has one amazing instinct...

00:12.512 --> 00:13.847
survival.

00:25.984 --> 00:29.071
Even when it appears
as though nothing's happening,

00:29.154 --> 00:32.282
white blood cells spring to life
to fight infection,

00:32.365 --> 00:35.035
tissue repairs itself, and the heart...

00:36.537 --> 00:38.038
keeps beating.

00:42.125 --> 00:45.838
Emotional scars can be
more difficult to heal,

00:45.921 --> 00:49.341
but we do our best
by renewing old friendships...

00:50.508 --> 00:52.510
creating joyful moments...

00:54.471 --> 00:56.139
or trying new things.

00:59.810 --> 01:02.229
To make us feel like
we're doing something,

01:02.312 --> 01:03.939
even if we feel helpless.

01:05.023 --> 01:07.818
But through it all,
as long as our hearts keep beating...

01:08.694 --> 01:09.862
we survive.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.578
And that's my latest post.

01:18.912 --> 01:22.082
It's number 50 since the bus crash.

01:24.542 --> 01:26.419
Blink once if you totally loved it.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.511
Did you just...

01:34.594 --> 01:35.721
Can you hear me?

01:35.804 --> 01:37.472
Tristan, can you hear me?

01:38.223 --> 01:40.893
Someone, come quick!
He just... he just moved!

01:45.939 --> 01:50.568
♪ Whatever it takes
I know I can make it through ♪

01:52.237 --> 01:57.034
♪ And if I hold out
I know I can make it through ♪

02:01.204 --> 02:06.418
♪ Be the best, be the best
The best that I can be ♪

02:06.501 --> 02:08.086
♪ Whatever it takes ♪

02:09.004 --> 02:12.758
♪ I know I can make it
I know I can make it through ♪

02:18.305 --> 02:20.557
Hurry up.
School starts in an hour.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.813
Wow.

02:25.896 --> 02:29.524
What do you think of my first day outfit?
I want to say "best year ever."

02:29.607 --> 02:31.484
Why not just get a T-shirt
with that phrase printed on it?

02:31.568 --> 02:34.655
Laa-shokran.
That means "No, thank you" in Arabic.

02:34.738 --> 02:37.490
I have learned a little so I can help make
the Syrians feel more welcome.

02:37.574 --> 02:38.784
All of them?
Or just the ladies?

02:38.867 --> 02:40.577
All of them.

02:40.661 --> 02:43.747
We didn't spend the summer raising
60 grand so I could get a date, Grace.

02:45.749 --> 02:46.875
That's a lot of clubs.

02:46.959 --> 02:49.211
Yeah, ten more than last year.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.213
Tristan would be proud.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.965
He'd also want me to be president.

02:53.048 --> 02:55.092
Hey, Zoë won last spring's
special election, fair and square.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.345
I really thought he'd be better by now
and would be here to take over.

02:58.428 --> 02:59.763
I'm sure he'll be back soon enough.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.307
Then he can give you
some tips on how to pick up...

03:03.350 --> 03:05.435
your presidential dry cleaning.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.813
Well, I gotta get my stuff for class.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.357
I will meet you at lunch to get
the food ready for the welcome barbecue.

03:12.109 --> 03:14.611
Goldi doesn't know I'm gay.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.071
So?

03:16.154 --> 03:17.990
Well, I can't tell just anyone.

03:18.073 --> 03:20.367
- You still haven't told your mom.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.120
She just got engaged, and she was so proud
when I won that election.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.997
You'll have to tell her eventually.

03:25.080 --> 03:28.291
But right now, I need to focus on making
everything great for the new school year.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.002
Then I'll tell her...

03:30.085 --> 03:32.045
when I go away to college.

03:32.129 --> 03:34.339
What's Arabic for "terrible idea"?

03:34.422 --> 03:37.718
We have spare together!
SP 301?

03:37.801 --> 03:40.512
Lola, "S," science. "P," physics.
Grade 11.

03:40.595 --> 03:43.265
Ooh!
You're breaking my heart, Shay.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.685
He's really here.

03:47.770 --> 03:49.271
How do I look?

03:49.354 --> 03:50.856
It might be kind of weird.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.190
You haven't seen him all summer.

03:52.274 --> 03:54.526
You look great.
Go.

03:54.609 --> 03:55.693
Okay.

04:00.824 --> 04:03.243
Hey, Tiny, kiss her!
Kiss her!

04:03.326 --> 04:06.413
-Would you get lost?
-Will you? She's waiting for it.

04:12.044 --> 04:14.838
-Aren't they the cutest?
-Suddenly, I can't wait to get to physics.

04:16.882 --> 04:19.885
Hey. Are you guys having trouble
posting things today?

04:19.968 --> 04:23.180
Only with Mom commenting on photos
of me and Yael, calling us "cute."

04:23.263 --> 04:24.431
Are you saying we're not cute?

04:24.514 --> 04:27.475
Yeah. Well, look, it's not letting me post
my Tristan update to the Degrassi page.

04:27.559 --> 04:28.685
I mean, can you... can you fix this?

04:28.769 --> 04:32.355
Uh, not without violating the terms
of Hunter's parole. Sorry.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.691
As if being back
at school isn't scary enough,

04:34.775 --> 04:36.568
now there's gonna be a bunch
of strange new people?

04:36.651 --> 04:39.029
They're just Syrians.
To them, you're the strange one.

04:41.573 --> 04:43.700
Hey, Hunter! Yael!
Good summer?

04:43.784 --> 04:44.910
- Good summer.
- Hi, Mr. Simpson.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.203
-Hey, Miles. Welcome back.
-Hey. Yeah.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.745
Uh, Principal Simpson, is there something

04:47.830 --> 04:49.414
wrong with the Degrassi community page
today, or--

04:49.497 --> 04:51.792
Oh, right. Yes. Um... we had some
complaints about your posts.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.336
Some people find them upsetting...

04:54.419 --> 04:56.088
Wait. Did you... did you...
You blocked me?

04:56.171 --> 04:57.505
Look, I just...
Listen, after the bus crash,

04:57.589 --> 04:58.631
everyone's trying their best to heal.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.926
Dude, you think I don't know that?
I mean, I'm the... I'm living it.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.635
I just wanna avoid
anything triggering, Miles.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.805
Okay. But look, regardless, this...
This time, it's good news.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.681
Right. Great. So why don't you
tell your friends in person

05:06.764 --> 05:09.309
and you can see the happy reaction
on their faces instead of on a screen.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.478
Okay? All right.
I'll talk to you later.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.236
Welcome to Degrassi.

05:20.195 --> 05:22.572
Hi! Are you one of our
new students from Syria?

05:25.325 --> 05:28.453
Welcome to Degrassi.
We'll be starting our tour soon.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.333
Yep, a safe space for everyone...

05:33.416 --> 05:36.169
except our president, who's stuffing
herself back into the closet.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.173
I'm just not coming out to my mom.
I can still be out at school.

05:40.257 --> 05:42.800
How will anyone know? You don't exactly
have rainbow emojis in your bios.

05:42.885 --> 05:44.344
My mom follows me on everything.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.803
Just tell your mom.
It'll be okay.

05:45.888 --> 05:48.265
She's super Catholic.
It most definitely will not.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.392
Oh, come on. No one has a problem
with gay people anymore.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.727
We have a problem with the QSA.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.812
-Who?
-The Queer-Straight Alliance.

05:54.897 --> 05:57.190
It used to be called the LGBT Club.

05:57.274 --> 05:59.401
We have a problem with...

05:59.484 --> 06:00.610
gay people.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.743
What is going on?

06:08.826 --> 06:12.747
A kiss-in, which we're staging
until you give us back our office.

06:13.498 --> 06:17.335
This is the prayer room now.
Uh, we gave you a different office.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.671
A converted janitor's closet.
How ironic.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.299
We just want our new Muslim students

06:22.382 --> 06:24.134
to have a central location
within the school.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.302
So let us share the room.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.428
These students are coming from Syria.

06:26.511 --> 06:29.847
They're likely more conservative,
and they're just not used to seeing, uh...

06:30.598 --> 06:33.185
Gay people?
Some of them might be gay.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.769
No.

06:34.852 --> 06:37.314
So because they're more intolerant,
they get the better room?

06:37.397 --> 06:41.484
Is our student council seriously
just a bunch of cowardly homophobes?

06:41.568 --> 06:43.445
I am not homophobic.
I can't be.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.447
-Why not?
-I'm gay.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.493
You?

06:53.205 --> 06:55.457
The LGBT community
have already won their fights.

06:56.333 --> 06:59.127
Can't we just focus on making
the newcomers feel at home?

07:02.630 --> 07:04.341
I have a tour to do,

07:04.424 --> 07:06.343
then get hot dogs
for the welcome barbecue.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.885
Hope to see you all there.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.351
So you guys combined
protesting and kissing?

07:14.434 --> 07:15.978
I've got to get in on this.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.271
It was pretty sweet.

07:18.355 --> 07:21.608
Speaking of kissing,
did you see Shay and Tiny this morning?

07:21.691 --> 07:23.944
They're, like,
the cutest couple in school.

07:24.027 --> 07:27.155
She's cute. But him?
Is it a cumulative score?

07:28.406 --> 07:29.407
They're not that cute.

07:29.491 --> 07:31.701
Okay?
Me and Tiny are way cuter.

07:33.245 --> 07:34.871
I totally forgot you two dated.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.457
And you haven't purged the photos yet?

07:37.540 --> 07:38.875
Figured you would've moved on.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.961
I have, but...

07:41.044 --> 07:43.255
Doesn't mean I should forget
how cute we were.

07:43.921 --> 07:48.551
You may be asking...
is it illegal to look this good?

07:48.635 --> 07:52.805
Well, get ready to find out that answer
in Grade 11 law.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.976
We'll begin this unit by discussing
legal considerations

07:56.059 --> 07:58.311
for social networking users.

07:58.395 --> 08:02.440
You should always act appropriately
when posting online because you are liable

08:02.524 --> 08:06.486
for sharing anything
that contains defamatory content or...

08:08.155 --> 08:10.615
You know, I almost didn't recognize you
without your cast on.

08:10.698 --> 08:13.368
Yeah, it still feels weird
to have it off.

08:14.286 --> 08:16.829
I thought Maya was in this class.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.166
Yeah, I actually haven't seen her all day.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.334
Okay, guys.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.211
Come on, who, uh, who narced to Simpson?

08:23.295 --> 08:24.754
Hmm?

08:24.837 --> 08:26.548
Apparently, my updates
about my boyfriend's health

08:26.631 --> 08:29.176
were just maybe getting
a bit too much for the...

08:29.259 --> 08:32.095
delicate flowers in the room.
So who was it?

08:34.931 --> 08:37.184
I, for one, am glad
they aren't popping into my timeline.

08:38.810 --> 08:41.063
Are you... Are you...
You kidding me right now?

08:41.854 --> 08:43.731
They did get kind of personal.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.442
Well, like, yeah.
I mean...

08:45.525 --> 08:48.903
my boyfriend nearly died, right?
I mean, how could that not be personal?

08:48.986 --> 08:51.073
She means it was sad to watch you
delude yourself all summer.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.285
Well, he's getting better.
Okay?

08:55.368 --> 08:57.037
He squeezed my hand
while I was reading to him.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.330
Uh, that's great!
Yeah!

08:59.414 --> 09:01.749
--That's what I mean.

09:01.833 --> 09:04.627
What actually happened?
He went like this?

09:04.711 --> 09:05.878
Yes, exactly.

09:05.962 --> 09:09.174
Probably some leftover signals
in the nervous system. Involuntary.

09:11.926 --> 09:15.180
No. No, the doctors were all over it.
Why would they lie to me?

09:15.263 --> 09:16.473
- So you don't off yourself?

09:16.556 --> 09:17.890
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

09:17.974 --> 09:19.601
Let's stay positive, folks!

09:19.684 --> 09:22.229
To limber up
our creative muscles this year,

09:22.312 --> 09:25.232
we're gonna start
with a classic first-person story.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.234
"What I did on my summer vacation."

09:27.317 --> 09:30.528
Now this'll be an exercise
in more showing rather than telling.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.740
If we hurry,
we can still make it back in time.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.368
Did I make a huge mistake
with how I handled the QSA?

09:36.451 --> 09:38.828
No, I think pretending you were gay
was a great, masterful play.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.665
-It wasn't a play. I am gay.
-Really?

09:42.749 --> 09:44.126
You don't look gay.

09:45.377 --> 09:47.712
I mean, I'm cool with it,
just so you know.

09:47.795 --> 09:49.756
I mean, I was Tristan's VP last year.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.591
I know it's kind of weird
that I was VP last year,

09:51.674 --> 09:54.844
and then you won the by-election, and
so I'm VP again this year. But it's fine.

09:54.927 --> 09:57.305
- All of it. It's fine.

09:58.306 --> 10:00.183
Okay.
Why is my phone blowing up?

10:00.892 --> 10:02.477
Bunch of notifications.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.728
About what?
Tristan?

10:03.811 --> 10:05.272
My passcode is 1234.
Open it.

10:05.355 --> 10:08.150
- Okay. Not the time!
- Ooh.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.942
Our president is a self-hating gay,

10:10.026 --> 10:13.155
who'll let people trample over our rights
like it's 1999.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.947
-Oh, my God.
-Okay. I wouldn't worry about it.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.284
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God...
-Vijay's a part of my brother's vlog crew,

10:17.367 --> 10:18.701
and he's not exactly viral.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.495
My mom doesn't know I'm gay!

10:20.578 --> 10:22.414
They tagged me in it.
What if it gets to her?

10:22.497 --> 10:23.665
I need to untag it before she sees.

10:23.748 --> 10:24.749
--Zoë, it's fine--

10:37.679 --> 10:38.888
Hi. Miles.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.807
- Oh. Mrs. Milligan.
- You're early today.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.811
Has his doctor been by yet?

10:45.978 --> 10:48.064
I don't know
that his doctor's coming today.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.609
-He keeps getting better.
-That's what we hope. Yeah.

10:56.281 --> 10:59.742
Did the doctors say that...
they hope he is?

10:59.826 --> 11:01.411
Or that... that he is?

11:02.370 --> 11:04.497
It's complicated, honey.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.793
Did he really grab my hand?

11:08.876 --> 11:10.545
It's common for coma patients

11:10.628 --> 11:14.257
to exhibit that kind of auto-response,
is what the doctors said.

11:20.137 --> 11:22.474
Do they think
that he's gonna be normal again?

11:29.231 --> 11:33.526
They think that ten weeks is a long time
to be in a coma at this level.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.991
It's the school year, honey.

11:41.158 --> 11:43.160
Maybe you should get back to your friends.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.789
No, he needs me.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.418
I'll leave you two alone.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.012
How dead am I?

12:05.933 --> 12:06.934
Zoë!

12:07.644 --> 12:09.479
Oh, God! Oh.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.564
You talk.
I'll survey the damage.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.901
I'm so, so, so, so sorry.

12:14.984 --> 12:18.905
Oh, I hope so. The car was expensive.
Phil didn't have to buy it for you.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.283
I've just been under a lot of pressure
trying to be a good president,

12:21.366 --> 12:22.825
and then these kids were saying that--

12:22.909 --> 12:24.952
Oh, you mean that horrible video?

12:25.036 --> 12:27.204
Oh, honey, no.
I get it.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.794
I wouldn't want anyone saying those
awful things about me, either.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.671
But I wouldn't worry about it.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.047
Okay?
No one's gonna believe you're gay.

12:37.799 --> 12:40.635
It happens to all powerful women.
Even Hillary.

12:40.718 --> 12:41.886
It'll pass.

12:47.475 --> 12:50.562
Uh, there'll be a small deductible but,
otherwise, I think it's gonna be okay.

12:50.645 --> 12:52.229
More importantly, will you?

12:55.608 --> 12:56.609
Come...

12:57.569 --> 12:58.945
Let's do fashion club this year.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.488
Didn't we agree on cross country?

13:00.572 --> 13:03.032
Yeah, but I thought that we could
do something, you know, just us girls.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.492
No boyfriends.

13:04.576 --> 13:07.412
Jonah might be super into fashion.
You don't know.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.121
Take down the photo, Lo.

13:09.914 --> 13:10.915
Why?
What's the big deal?

13:10.998 --> 13:12.667
It's of you and my boyfriend.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.126
Yeah, it's a Throwback Thursday,

13:14.210 --> 13:16.629
as in, in the past,
when he wasn't your boyfriend.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.172
-Tell her, Franks.
-Uh...

13:18.255 --> 13:21.175
Tell Lola that posting a romantic photo
with my boyfriend is out of bounds!

13:21.258 --> 13:22.176
Uh...

13:22.259 --> 13:24.554
Whatever. You're wrong,
and everyone will side with me.

13:26.389 --> 13:28.350
Okay.
Let's jump right in.

13:29.976 --> 13:33.229
When judges get a case
about social media,

13:33.312 --> 13:35.940
they often have to have
the app explained to them,

13:36.023 --> 13:40.111
which is like,  hmm,
dealing with a case of mail fraud,

13:40.194 --> 13:42.196
but not knowing what a stamp is.

13:42.279 --> 13:45.241
So, for young defendants and plaintiffs...

14:11.976 --> 14:13.269
Okay.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.855
What's going on here?

14:18.400 --> 14:21.027
I'm not moving on till someone tells me.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.111
Vijay?

14:22.194 --> 14:25.072
Shay and Lola are sending
indirects to each other.

14:25.156 --> 14:27.867
You see, an indirect message is when
you chirp at someone without actually--

14:27.950 --> 14:29.994
I know what it is.
I'm not that old.

14:30.077 --> 14:32.329
But why is it happening in class?

14:33.289 --> 14:36.501
I posted a photo and Shay doesn't think
that should be allowed.

14:36.584 --> 14:39.712
All right. Since you're all
too distracted to listen to me...

14:40.630 --> 14:42.590
-let's try this case.
-What?

14:42.674 --> 14:46.428
I hereby open the proceedings
of The People v. Lola Pacini.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.391
That's it.
My mom hates me.

14:52.266 --> 14:53.768
Technically, she still doesn't know.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.228
But either I never tell her,
and we have this secret between us,

14:56.312 --> 14:58.272
or I do, and she hates me.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.356
I'm trapped.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.152
Maybe you can cut your way out.

15:05.530 --> 15:08.115
If she'd really be that awful,
then you don't need her in your life.

15:08.199 --> 15:12.286
But it's always
just been the two of us.

15:13.204 --> 15:15.247
She's the only family I have.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.586
You're not thinking
about hurting yourself again, are you?

15:23.297 --> 15:26.801
Sorry to interrupt, but the QSA
has not given up their protest yet.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.513
I won't put them back in that closet.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.599
-What about the prayer room?
-They'll share.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.685
I can't make the QSA hide.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.229
I have to be a good president
for everyone.

15:38.312 --> 15:40.732
If there's an actual conflict,
we can talk about it then.

15:47.822 --> 15:49.699
If only you could be that badass
for yourself.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.036
And did you pretend
the photo was recent?

15:54.120 --> 15:56.372
No. I clearly marked it a TBT.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.374
So, no one who saw it would still imagine

15:58.458 --> 15:59.876
-you two were still dating--
-Uh, objection.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.336
She couldn't know if anybody
might imagine that.

16:02.419 --> 16:04.171
- Um, sustained?
- Withdrawn.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.381
One more thing.

16:05.465 --> 16:09.051
You took the photo, it was on your phone
and you posted it to your account. Right?

16:09.135 --> 16:10.427
Yeah, it was a selfie.

16:10.512 --> 16:12.346
So, as the subject, artist, and publisher,

16:12.429 --> 16:15.099
there's no legal reason
you couldn't post it, right?

16:15.182 --> 16:16.518
I don't think so. No.

16:17.268 --> 16:18.478
Your witness.

16:19.854 --> 16:21.105
Miss Pacini...

16:21.188 --> 16:24.859
did you ask your BFF if you could post
a picture of you with her boyfriend?

16:24.942 --> 16:26.486
Objection.
Relevance?

16:26.569 --> 16:27.862
We've established Lola owns the photo.

16:27.945 --> 16:31.282
Your Honor, I'm just trying to prove
an element of emotional damage.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.075
Sustained, I guess?

16:33.159 --> 16:34.160
I didn't ask. No.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.664
Perhaps because you wanted to provoke
a reaction from her?

16:37.747 --> 16:39.874
What? No!
I just thought we looked cute!

16:39.957 --> 16:41.668
And you wanted to threaten Shay
with said cuteness?

16:41.751 --> 16:42.752
Because you still have feelings for him!

16:42.835 --> 16:44.837
Because you stole him from me!

16:50.092 --> 16:51.302
Go to hell!

16:51.385 --> 16:54.430
- Whoa.
- Language! Office, Ms. Pacini.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.852
I'd like to request a recess.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.661
What are you doing?
You can't just wreck stuff.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.580
- Who cares?

17:18.663 --> 17:20.164
I bet that teacher will.
Quick!

17:43.104 --> 17:45.272
It's... it's just such a huge lie.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.735
There's no such thing
as a safe space for everyone.

17:49.819 --> 17:50.903
No kidding.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.198
Everyone thinks
I should pretend I'm not sad,

17:54.281 --> 17:55.742
just because Shay's happy.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.287
It's, like, we're hurting,

18:00.371 --> 18:01.831
and we're not allowed
to talk about our pain,

18:01.914 --> 18:03.040
because it makes them uncomfortable.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.042
What?

18:07.211 --> 18:09.631
We have to care about everyone's feelings,

18:09.714 --> 18:11.633
unless our feelings are hurting
their feelings,

18:11.716 --> 18:13.259
then we're not allowed to have
any feelings.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.136
Yeah, it's crap.

18:15.219 --> 18:16.638
Exactly.

18:16.721 --> 18:19.682
And that would have been
a more appropriate word to say in class.

18:24.646 --> 18:28.608
And, uh, when we danced,
the kids all cheered for us.

18:28.691 --> 18:30.067
I got to admit, I kind of teared up.

18:30.151 --> 18:32.403
After the crash,
I just felt lucky to be there.

18:37.408 --> 18:39.118
Very nice, Zig.
Very nice.

18:40.536 --> 18:42.454
Miles, you ready?

18:44.248 --> 18:46.083
I have visual aids.
Is that okay?

18:51.130 --> 18:53.716
This is what I did on my vacation.

18:56.260 --> 19:00.139
June 5th, I watched the doctors
carve a hole into my boyfriend's skull--

19:00.222 --> 19:02.767
-Miles, take that down!
-Have you ever loved somebody

19:02.850 --> 19:05.269
so much that you just wished
you could take all their pain

19:05.352 --> 19:07.313
- and give it to yourself?
- Miles!

19:07.396 --> 19:08.981
'Cause if you haven't,
then it's impossible for you

19:09.065 --> 19:12.944
to understand how much it is important
that we don't just give up on Tristan.

19:14.278 --> 19:15.404
You're a sadist.

19:17.448 --> 19:20.702
Just because everybody leaves you
doesn't mean he's leaving me, okay?

19:22.995 --> 19:24.664
Hey! Hey!

19:25.707 --> 19:27.667
- Come on. Let's go.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.335
Let's all go!

19:30.211 --> 19:31.754
Except you, Miles.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.648
- Hey.

19:51.733 --> 19:54.276
-Have you seen Maya?
-Uh, no. You?

19:55.569 --> 19:57.404
No. Here comes Zoë's big speech.

19:59.949 --> 20:00.992
Marhaba.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.577
"Welcome."

20:03.660 --> 20:08.165
I extend this to all of our new students
from near and far.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.086
We all have one thing in common...

20:13.004 --> 20:15.798
We wanna be loved for who we are.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.971
We need to celebrate our differences.

20:28.394 --> 20:31.438
For instance... I'm gay.

20:32.439 --> 20:35.151
I'm not bragging about it but...

20:37.987 --> 20:41.783
I've always been afraid to say it
and I'm not anymore.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.327
I want this place to be a safe space

20:45.411 --> 20:47.872
where everyone feels free
to be themselves.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.331
Yeah.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.087
Welcome to Degrassi.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.396
You are such a badass.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.903
You're not still worried about
this getting back to your mom, are you?

21:18.986 --> 21:21.488
Nah. She wouldn't believe it
unless she caught me

21:21.572 --> 21:22.698
making out with a girl.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.451
And I can't even find a girl
to make out with, so...

21:25.534 --> 21:29.371
Zoë, this is Rasha.
She's staying with our family.

21:29.455 --> 21:32.708
Hi. Uh, you're the one
who put the queer students' club

21:32.792 --> 21:34.877
in the same room
as the Muslim prayer space?

21:36.170 --> 21:38.297
Yes. Yes, I did.

21:38.380 --> 21:41.300
That would never have happened in Syria.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.468
Very cool.

21:45.262 --> 21:46.263
Come here.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.770
--Best year ever, indeed.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.576
Po-po caught up to you after all?

22:08.452 --> 22:09.703
No, actually.

22:09.786 --> 22:13.165
I acted up in class,
kind of thanks to your wise words.

22:16.252 --> 22:19.046
You know, you can talk to me about Tristan
all you want.

22:19.130 --> 22:21.673
As long as I can talk to you about Tiny.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.968
Okay, this is detention, not NPR.

22:24.051 --> 22:25.511
No talking for the next hour.

22:51.287 --> 22:54.665
I'm... I'm so glad I found someone
who understands my grief.
