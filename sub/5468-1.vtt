00:41.953 --> 00:44.677
We can't hold out much longer, sir!

01:11.658 --> 01:14.114
General Hummel, you've gotta
get us outta here now!

01:14.190 --> 01:16.724
I won't let you down.
I won't let you down, son.

01:22.365 --> 01:26.510
Goddamn it, sir! How long do we have
to wait? I've lost 15 men already!

01:26.548 --> 01:30.118
Sir, they're lightin' us up
like a firestorm!

01:30.194 --> 01:32.381
This is General Hummel.
You gotta get my men outta there!

01:32.459 --> 01:34.915
We don't have clearance
to go behind enemy lines, sir.

01:38.637 --> 01:40.518
They're not coming for us,
are they, sir?

01:50.115 --> 01:52.032
Congressman Weaver
and esteemed members...

01:52.110 --> 01:53.836
of the Special Armed Services
Committee.

01:54.565 --> 01:58.134
I come before you to protest
a grave injustice.

02:06.732 --> 02:08.727
Aim!

02:10.913 --> 02:12.909
It has to stop.

02:54.435 --> 02:57.581
I miss you so much.

03:05.949 --> 03:09.018
There's something I've gotta do, Barb.

03:09.095 --> 03:11.859
Something I couldn't do
while you were here.

03:11.937 --> 03:16.618
I tried.
You know I tried everything.

03:16.695 --> 03:20.802
And I still don't have
their attention.

03:20.878 --> 03:24.600
Let's hope this elevates
their thinking.

03:24.678 --> 03:26.981
But whatever happens...

03:28.515 --> 03:31.431
please don't think less of me.

04:12.457 --> 04:14.261
Marine, inform the garrison C.O...

04:14.300 --> 04:17.062
that General Hummel's coming on
board with a security inspection team.

04:17.140 --> 04:20.748
Yes, sir.
Sir, it's an honor having you, sir.

04:48.840 --> 04:52.255
Ya know, at least
we can get some--

04:52.332 --> 04:55.249
- A long time before guard meeting, huh?
- Yeah, I'll tell ya.

05:08.798 --> 05:13.825
I got the access card. We've got
30 minutes 'til those darts wear off.

05:13.901 --> 05:15.935
Move it!

05:18.737 --> 05:21.423
The access card, sir.

05:23.113 --> 05:25.876
Let's do it.

05:28.945 --> 05:31.749
2400 magazine check.

05:46.678 --> 05:49.248
- Man, it's wet out there!
- Check me through, will ya?

05:58.612 --> 06:01.068
Clear!

06:26.973 --> 06:30.082
- I want 16, Major!
- Move it!

06:54.184 --> 06:57.791
Evac! Seal the door!

06:57.830 --> 06:58.981
- No!
- Come on, man!
- No!
- Seal it!

06:59.057 --> 07:01.782
- No!
- Seal it!
- Help!

07:04.585 --> 07:07.195
Let me outta here! Oh, God!
Let me outta here! Oh, God!

07:07.271 --> 07:09.305
Let me out! Let me out!

07:09.382 --> 07:13.297
Clear out.
Get outta here!

07:19.898 --> 07:22.584
Sorry.

07:27.727 --> 07:29.952
Let's move out.

07:40.852 --> 07:43.193
Two more cc's
of acetylene chloride.

07:46.493 --> 07:51.060
- That'll be five dollars, lsherwood.
- You suck.

07:57.584 --> 08:00.234
You guys have too much time
on your hands.

08:00.272 --> 08:04.108
Yes! She's here! Bring it
to me now. Thank you, Phil!

08:04.186 --> 08:07.371
What's that?
Why'd you get it sent here?

08:07.409 --> 08:11.401
Carla wouldn't approve. She thinks
it's dumb to spend $600 on an L.P.

08:11.439 --> 08:15.622
Carla's right. Why don't you
just spend $13 on a CD, man?

08:15.698 --> 08:17.772
First of all,
it's because I'm a Beatlemaniac.

08:17.848 --> 08:20.189
And second,
these sound better.

08:21.569 --> 08:25.140
Could be serious.
Could be sarin gas.

08:27.443 --> 08:30.167
A dog out of JFK caught a whiff
of something in this package...

08:30.206 --> 08:32.086
postmarked to
a Bosnian refugee camp.

08:32.123 --> 08:34.888
It could be detergent,
or it could be sarin gas.

08:34.965 --> 08:36.768
Bosnian refugee camp?

08:36.845 --> 08:40.068
Half a million Serbians
reside in the U.S., Marvin.
Serbians don't like Bosnians.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.294
You guys wanna get suited up?

08:45.672 --> 08:48.781
- You bring the cockroaches?
- Got 'em.

08:48.858 --> 08:50.892
We have air lock, Stanley.
You're all set to go.

08:55.419 --> 08:59.259
October 1, 0900 hours.

08:59.336 --> 09:02.905
Agent Stanley Goodspeed,
Agent/Trainee Marvin lsherwood...

09:02.981 --> 09:05.130
initiating exam
of wooden crate.

09:05.208 --> 09:08.508
Suspicion of sarin gas inside.

09:08.584 --> 09:11.042
- Marvin, sarin is a--
- G.B. aerosol.

09:11.119 --> 09:12.731
That is correct.

09:12.807 --> 09:14.955
Now, let's see.
We have some dirty magazines.

09:15.033 --> 09:16.951
Stone Age Cave Girls
in the Raw.

09:17.029 --> 09:20.982
Kinky. And, uh--
Not a good sign.

09:21.097 --> 09:24.090
Hello, little baby doll.

09:24.167 --> 09:26.124
Lookit, Stan.

09:26.201 --> 09:28.234
- Hi there, Stanley.
- Marvin!
- Marvin, don't!

09:28.312 --> 09:32.495
- Hi, Stan.
- Shit! Move back! Move back!

09:33.608 --> 09:36.141
- I want the exhaust.
- Hang on, guys.

09:36.178 --> 09:38.482
We'll have that room clear
in 50 seconds! You're gonna be okay.

09:38.559 --> 09:40.822
Jesus Christ!

09:42.165 --> 09:45.390
Okay, I've got some bad news
and some really bad news.

09:45.466 --> 09:48.729
The bad news is that the gas is
corrosive and it's eating our suits.

09:48.805 --> 09:51.836
- It's all over my hand, man!
- The really bad news...

09:51.914 --> 09:55.483
is there's enough C-4 explosive and
poison gas to blow the whole chamber...

09:55.521 --> 09:58.516
-and kill everybody
in the building.
-Detonation too heavy.
-Everybody, out of the room now!

09:58.592 --> 10:00.894
Seal us inside.

10:04.578 --> 10:07.610
- Where are the sprinklers, Lonner?
- The acid's eating my su--

10:07.649 --> 10:10.988
It's eating my fucking suit!
All right? Shit!

10:11.064 --> 10:14.364
- Just wash us off!
- Where are my sprinklers?

10:14.402 --> 10:16.207
We're working on it.
It's coming. It's just a flow problem.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.816
Well, that's a pretty big
friggin' problem, Lonner. Fix it now!

10:18.854 --> 10:22.118
- We're working on it! How much time
do you have on that detonator?
- A minute ten.

10:22.194 --> 10:24.342
- Look at this!
- We're gonna have the room clear.

10:24.420 --> 10:27.337
- Tell 'em to take the atropine, now!
- The atropine, lsherwood.

10:27.413 --> 10:30.022
- What?
- Where's my water, Lonner? One minute!

10:30.099 --> 10:34.283
- Marvin, the atropine, now!
- Inject it in your heart
before your suit melts.

10:34.359 --> 10:36.740
Shit!

10:36.816 --> 10:38.620
Make him take his dose.

10:38.696 --> 10:41.958
- Where's that water?
- Get that away from me!

10:42.035 --> 10:45.413
Come on, Phil, fix it
for Christ's sake!

10:45.489 --> 10:48.751
- Take the atropine now, Stan,
for Christ's sake!
- We're fucked.

10:48.789 --> 10:50.708
The poison's mixing.

10:50.784 --> 10:54.509
What the fuck are you
waiting for, Stanley?
You take the fucking needle now!

10:54.585 --> 10:57.079
- Fuck! Shit! Oh, fuck, shit!
- Forty seconds!

10:57.155 --> 11:00.494
If that suit melts--
If you die, we all die!

11:00.572 --> 11:03.028
Inject your heart
and then diffuse the bomb!

11:03.066 --> 11:06.136
- Come on, just do it, Stan!
- Shit! What if I miss my heart?
I can't see shit!

11:06.214 --> 11:10.973
-Do it now!
-Look how big this is. You want
me to stick this into my heart?

11:11.049 --> 11:14.427
- Are you fucking nuts?
- The sprinkler's coming! It's coming!

11:14.503 --> 11:16.537
Okay, here we go, man!

11:19.148 --> 11:21.066
Sprinkler activated.

11:21.143 --> 11:23.023
How much time left?

11:23.100 --> 11:25.327
Twenty seconds!

11:26.132 --> 11:28.280
We're not gonna make it.

11:29.279 --> 11:31.428
Fifteen.

11:34.153 --> 11:35.996
Oh, come on.

11:36.072 --> 11:38.298
Clear!

11:40.293 --> 11:42.635
Get me the fuck out of this gas chamber!

11:42.711 --> 11:46.050
I almost stabbed myself
in the heart with this thing.

11:46.128 --> 11:48.545
Please lock me away

11:48.621 --> 11:51.039
- Stan?
- Hey, darlin'.

11:51.115 --> 11:52.536
Hi, baby.

11:52.614 --> 11:57.679
Here inside where I hide
with my loneliness

11:57.755 --> 12:00.211
I had such
an interesting day today.

12:00.288 --> 12:02.667
Yeah, I had kind of
an interesting day myself.

12:03.436 --> 12:05.699
Oh, okay, you go first.

12:05.777 --> 12:10.074
Oh, just some terrorists decided to send
a little care package, box of goodies...

12:10.152 --> 12:14.104
which had to be neutralized
before blowing up the office.

12:14.181 --> 12:15.870
So I took the rest of the day off.

12:15.946 --> 12:18.710
Glass of wine, little guitar.
Just relaxing.

12:18.748 --> 12:24.082
- Wow!
- I mean it, honey. The world is being
Fed-Ex'd to hell on a handcart.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.114
I really believe that anyone
who's even thinking about
having a child in this world...

12:27.192 --> 12:30.568
is coldly considering
an act of cruelty.

12:30.646 --> 12:33.409
I know, I'm rambling,
I'm complaining. I'm sorry.

12:33.485 --> 12:36.710
- What's your news, baby?
- I'm pregnant.

12:37.707 --> 12:39.935
I'm sorry?

12:39.972 --> 12:42.812
I'm pregnant.

12:44.039 --> 12:47.302
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:47.378 --> 12:50.257
-Wow!
-Is that all you're gonna say, is "wow"?

12:50.335 --> 12:52.752
- You're pregnant?
- Three weeks.

12:52.828 --> 12:55.015
How do you know? I mean,
h-how do you know?

12:57.549 --> 13:01.465
Blue! Just turned blue
so I went to the doctor.

13:01.541 --> 13:04.457
- Well, you didn't mean what
you just said, did you?
- When?

13:04.533 --> 13:06.568
Uh, just right now when you were talking
about bringing a child into the world...

13:06.606 --> 13:09.446
and having it be
an act of cruelty.

13:09.524 --> 13:13.362
-I meant it at the time.
-Stanley, at the time? You said
it seven and a half seconds ago.

13:13.439 --> 13:15.702
Well, gosh!

13:15.780 --> 13:19.003
Kind of a lot's happened since then.
Look, we're not even married.

13:19.080 --> 13:23.953
- I know. It's funny
you should mention that.
- It's funny?

13:24.031 --> 13:27.024
- Do you love me?
- Of course I love you.

13:27.063 --> 13:29.135
Good.

13:31.590 --> 13:36.427
- Will you marry me?
- Whoa! Whoa! Wai-- Hey,
Marriage Police, pull over!

13:36.503 --> 13:39.344
Come on, Stanley.
I'm proposing to you right now.

13:48.208 --> 13:52.469
The Rock is the most famous and was
the most feared prison ever built.

13:52.507 --> 13:54.925
Is it really true that
there's never been an escape?

13:55.001 --> 13:59.032
Ah, that's true. From 1936 until
'63 when the prison closed...

13:59.108 --> 14:00.874
there were 14 attempts.

14:00.950 --> 14:06.400
No one is believed to have made
it to shore, alive at least.

14:06.476 --> 14:09.507
No, uh, h-h-hey, hey, fellas. I'm sorry,
but tourists are not allowed back here.

14:09.585 --> 14:11.965
- I don't really give a shit!
Do you give a shit?
- No.

14:12.042 --> 14:14.420
- Come here, fruity.
- Move!

14:14.498 --> 14:18.220
- Hey, girls? Hi.
You all havin' a good time?
- Yeah.

14:18.296 --> 14:21.020
Will you do something for me?
It's really, it's really important.

14:21.098 --> 14:25.052
I need you to tell your teacher
that you need to get back on
the boat and go home right now.

14:25.128 --> 14:28.199
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Broadway!

14:28.275 --> 14:30.232
This cell block housed...

14:30.308 --> 14:33.726
the most awesome scum in America.

14:33.802 --> 14:36.335
Ladies and gentlemen,
l, Ranger Bob...

14:36.411 --> 14:40.940
cordially invite you to become inmates
of Alcatraz, temporarily, of course.

14:43.587 --> 14:45.814
On the line!

14:47.426 --> 14:50.227
Pretty tight quarters,
aren't they, huh?

14:50.304 --> 14:52.567
Like being a caged animal.

14:52.645 --> 14:55.177
Spend a couple of years in there--

14:55.216 --> 14:58.363
- What's the matter, fellas?
Something wrong with the tour?
- The tour's over, Bob.

15:04.388 --> 15:07.535
What kind of fucked-up tour
is this?

15:20.700 --> 15:23.540
General Hummel, Captains Frye
and Darrow reporting, sir.

15:23.617 --> 15:27.262
Welcome to The Rock, gentlemen.
Land the choppers on the
back side and deploy as planned.

15:27.340 --> 15:29.642
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Aye, aye, sir. Move out!

15:29.718 --> 15:31.638
I'm not allowed
to carry a gun.

15:31.716 --> 15:34.362
Oh, you're not allowed to carry
a gun? I got a goddamned gun.

15:34.401 --> 15:38.047
If I'd have known this was
gonna happen, I'd have brought
my motherfuckin' gun! Help!

15:41.001 --> 15:44.341
All right, gentlemen, this'll be
our new home. Tom, I want
my command center right here.

15:52.361 --> 15:54.165
- I want Coms up.
- Roger that, sir.

15:54.242 --> 15:58.465
Put the satellite over there.
I wanna be up at 1600.

15:58.541 --> 16:01.380
Let's move it.

16:10.093 --> 16:13.508
- Systems up.
- Possible penetration point
in the shower room.

16:13.585 --> 16:16.847
- We're setting anti-intrusion.
- I brought a personal touch, sir.

16:16.885 --> 16:20.801
It's an anti-motion trembler device.
It's custom-made.

16:20.878 --> 16:23.410
Nobody knows about it
and nobody expects it.

16:23.449 --> 16:26.710
- What's it do?
- We head-fake 'em with the laser beam.

16:26.749 --> 16:30.626
And then if they disturb
Mr. Backup here, we own 'em.

16:44.096 --> 16:47.204
Ladies and gentlemen, you're being
detained against your will.

16:47.282 --> 16:49.507
For that, I apologize.

16:49.583 --> 16:51.578
It is not our intention
in any way to harm you.

16:51.656 --> 16:54.918
You will not be detained one
minute longer than is necessary
for us to complete our mission.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.438
Attention on deck!

17:03.515 --> 17:07.084
Stand easy, men.

17:07.160 --> 17:11.767
Make no mistake about it, gentlemen,
we are now in harm's way.

17:11.843 --> 17:16.296
For Major Baxter and l,
this is the last campaign
in a career datin' back to Tet '68.

17:17.678 --> 17:20.134
Likewise for Captain Hendrix,
Gunnery Sergeant Crisp,

17:20.210 --> 17:23.856
who cut their teeth
under my command in Desert Storm.

17:23.894 --> 17:27.348
Captain Frye, Captain Darrow,
this is my first operational
situation with you and your men.

17:27.425 --> 17:30.113
And I have to say, thus far
your conduct reflects your reputations.

17:30.189 --> 17:32.069
- Thank you, General.
- Thank you, sir.

17:32.146 --> 17:35.485
We have achieved our position
through poise, precision and audacity.

17:35.561 --> 17:37.556
To this we must now add resolve.

17:37.634 --> 17:40.974
We'll be branded as traitors,
the gravest capital crime.

17:41.050 --> 17:43.122
Punishable by death.

17:44.196 --> 17:46.345
A couple hundred years ago...

17:46.423 --> 17:48.878
a few guys named Washington,
Jefferson and Adams...

17:48.954 --> 17:52.141
were branded as traitors
by the British.

17:52.218 --> 17:54.942
And now they're called patriots.

17:54.981 --> 17:56.938
In time, so shall we.

17:58.664 --> 18:00.622
God willing,
in less than 48 hours...

18:00.698 --> 18:06.071
you will evacuate this island
in gunships under cover of
hostages and V.X. gas warheads.

18:06.148 --> 18:09.487
Your destination:
a non-extradition treaty country.

18:09.564 --> 18:13.978
You will each be paid a fee
of $1 million for services rendered.

18:14.055 --> 18:18.660
But you can never again
set foot on your native soil.

18:18.699 --> 18:21.499
- Can you live with that?
- Yes, sir!

18:21.576 --> 18:23.264
The men of
Marine Force Recon...

18:23.341 --> 18:26.796
are selected to carry out
illegal operations throughout the world.

18:28.216 --> 18:31.133
When they don't come home...

18:31.209 --> 18:34.816
their families are told fairy tales
about what happened to them...

18:34.894 --> 18:37.004
and denied compensation.

18:37.082 --> 18:40.382
Well, I have choked
on these lies my entire career!

18:40.458 --> 18:42.876
Well, here and now the lies stop!

18:48.441 --> 18:52.087
God be with all of you.
Man your positions, men.

18:55.963 --> 18:58.111
This is FBI Director Womack.

18:58.189 --> 19:01.605
Director, be advised.

19:01.681 --> 19:04.329
Eighty-one, I say again,

19:04.406 --> 19:08.090
81 civilians are under
my control as of this moment.

19:08.167 --> 19:12.275
You are to take measures to assure this
remains a need-to-know classified fact.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.694
Who is this?

19:13.772 --> 19:16.419
Mr. Director, you have
a very serious problem.

19:16.496 --> 19:19.144
A battery of V.X. gas rockets
is presently deployed...

19:19.220 --> 19:23.328
to deliver a highly
lethal strike on the population
of the San Francisco Bay area.

19:23.404 --> 19:27.625
-I will call again at 0100 hours
to state my demands.
-I want to know who I'm talking to.

19:27.701 --> 19:31.693
This is Brigadier General
Francis X. Hummel, United States
Marine Corps, from Alcatraz.

19:31.769 --> 19:33.842
Out!

19:35.340 --> 19:37.987
- I'll cancel your reservations.
- Get the Pentagon.

19:38.064 --> 19:42.862
And call the San Francisco office.
It seems Alcatraz was just reopened.

19:43.591 --> 19:46.586
Last night General Hummel,
using brutal but nonlethal force...

19:46.662 --> 19:51.727
under the guise of a security
exercise, walked off with 15
V.X. poison gas rockets.

19:51.805 --> 19:53.761
He lost one of his own men
in the process.

19:53.876 --> 19:57.368
That's General Hummel in Vietnam.
I think he was a major at the time.

19:57.446 --> 20:01.515
Three tours in Vietnam,
Panama, Grenada, Desert Storm.

20:01.591 --> 20:04.354
Three Purple Hearts,
two Silver Stars...

20:04.430 --> 20:06.120
and the Congressional Medal of--

20:06.196 --> 20:09.266
Jesus! This man is a hero!

20:09.305 --> 20:11.762
Well, I think "legend" might be
a better description, Mr. Sinclair.

20:11.838 --> 20:15.137
Well, now we can add kidnapping
and extortion to his list of accolades.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.594
Mr. Sinclair, General Hummel
is a man of honor.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.742
General, it's him.

20:22.852 --> 20:24.694
Frank, it's AI Kramer.

20:24.771 --> 20:26.536
Hi, Al, how you doin'?

20:26.612 --> 20:28.877
I don't know, Frank.
Ah, why don't you tell me.

20:28.954 --> 20:31.678
Got a lot of very, very
worried people here, Frank.

20:31.717 --> 20:33.599
I'll come straight to the point.

20:33.636 --> 20:37.013
Eight-three Force Reconnaissance Marines
have died under my various commands.

20:37.090 --> 20:39.355
Forty-seven in northern Laos
and southern China.

20:39.431 --> 20:42.500
Southern China? We never admitted
we sent troops into China.

20:42.578 --> 20:44.766
Who is this?
ldentify yourself.

20:44.843 --> 20:48.604
White House Chief of Staff
Hayden Sinclair, General.

20:48.680 --> 20:52.287
- How old are you,
Chief of Staff Sinclair?
- I'm 33.

20:52.364 --> 20:56.394
Well, Mr. Sinclair, you've probably got
no fucking idea what I'm talking about.

20:56.472 --> 20:58.735
By your ninth birthday, I was
runnin' black ops into China...

20:58.811 --> 21:01.728
and my men were responsible
f-for over 200 enemy kills.

21:01.806 --> 21:06.487
Al, put some rigging tape over Mr.
Sinclair's mouth. He's wasting my time.

21:06.564 --> 21:07.985
Ah, you want to continue, Frank?

21:08.061 --> 21:10.173
Remember Operation Desert Storm?

21:10.249 --> 21:13.895
Those surgical hits made by
our smart bombs, covered so well on CNN?

21:13.972 --> 21:18.424
It was my men on the ground
that made those hits possible
by lasing the targets.

21:18.500 --> 21:21.840
Twenty of them were left to rot outside
Baghdad after the conflict ended.

21:21.917 --> 21:24.373
No benefits were paid
to their families.

21:24.449 --> 21:27.749
No medals conferred.

21:27.827 --> 21:32.049
These men died for their country,
and they weren't even given
a goddamn military burial.

21:34.044 --> 21:37.959
The situation is unacceptable.
You will transfer $100 million...

21:38.035 --> 21:41.757
from the Grand Cayman Red Sea
Trading Company account
to an account I designate.

21:41.796 --> 21:44.445
From these funds, reparations
of $1 million will be paid...

21:44.521 --> 21:46.976
to each of
the 83 marines' families.

21:47.054 --> 21:50.430
The rest of the funds I will
disperse at my discretion.

21:51.237 --> 21:52.656
Do I make myself clear?

21:52.732 --> 21:55.957
Except for the Red Sea Trading Company.
What is that?

21:56.035 --> 21:58.875
- Identify yourself.
- This is FBI Director Womack, General.

21:58.951 --> 22:02.481
It's a slush fund where the Pentagon
keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.

22:02.558 --> 22:04.977
Jesus, Frank!
This is classified information.

22:05.053 --> 22:08.622
You alert the media,
I launch the gas.

22:08.698 --> 22:11.309
You refuse payment,
I launch the gas.

22:11.385 --> 22:15.146
You've got 40 hours,
'til noon day after tomorrow
to arrange transfer of the money.

22:15.223 --> 22:19.023
I am aware of your
countermeasure. You know and I
know it doesn't stand a chance.

22:19.060 --> 22:22.745
Hummel from Alcatraz. Out.

22:22.821 --> 22:27.504
All right. We have to identify
the hostages and contact
each of their families.

22:27.542 --> 22:31.342
Uh, tell 'em somethin'. Make up a story,
and we've got to keep this undercover.

22:31.419 --> 22:35.486
If this comes out, the city
of San Francisco will be
in chaos. I am talking anarchy.

22:35.562 --> 22:39.016
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What is the potential casualty rate...

22:39.094 --> 22:44.045
for a single rocket armed with
V.X. poison gas, General Peterson?

22:44.121 --> 22:47.077
- Sixty or seventy.
- Well, that's, that's not so bad.

22:47.153 --> 22:51.836
- Thousand. Seventy thousand dead!
- Oh.

22:51.912 --> 22:56.402
One teaspoon of this hits the floor,
it's lethal up to a hundred feet.

22:56.479 --> 23:00.163
One teaspoon of this shit
detonated in the atmosphere...

23:00.240 --> 23:03.081
will kill every living organism
in an eight-block radius.

23:03.157 --> 23:05.422
Get the point?

23:05.498 --> 23:07.953
Uh, what did Hummel mean
by your countermeasure, General?

23:08.031 --> 23:12.060
Standard poison is countered
by napalm. It burns it up,
consumes it upon detonation.

23:12.136 --> 23:14.403
Now, the problem
with V.X. poison gas is...

23:14.440 --> 23:16.782
that it's designed specifically
to withstand napalm.

23:16.860 --> 23:20.199
That's where, uh, thermite plasma
comes in. General Peterson?

23:20.275 --> 23:23.997
Thermite plasma incendiary systems
can burn hot enough to consume V.X....

23:24.074 --> 23:27.529
but they're still in the test phase;
it's not operational.

23:27.568 --> 23:31.866
Hummel knows this. We are dealing with
one smart son of a bitch.

23:31.942 --> 23:35.588
What's it gonna take to equip a flight
of F-18s with thermite plasma...

23:35.665 --> 23:38.275
within the next 36 hours?

23:38.352 --> 23:40.808
- An act of God.
- Excuse me?

23:41.920 --> 23:43.609
All right, we can try.

23:43.685 --> 23:47.178
But I strongly urge you to consider the
use of this as a secondary initiative.

23:47.254 --> 23:49.405
Then we have to go to our
primary initiative. Uh, Admiral?

23:49.481 --> 23:52.859
Sir, I'd like to bring in our SEAL
ground commander, Commander Anderson.

23:52.935 --> 23:57.464
Mr. Womack, who is
your best chemical/biological man?

23:57.617 --> 24:01.493
- Oh, that's interesting.
- Oh, yeah.
- That's very compelling.

24:06.942 --> 24:10.895
- You like my pigtails?
- Oh, yeah, the pigtails
are very naughty.

24:10.971 --> 24:13.736
Naughty. Naughty.

24:13.813 --> 24:18.035
Just the Amaretto cream
with peach sorbet persuasion.

24:18.111 --> 24:20.452
- This isn't happening.
- No, Stan, don't answer it.

24:20.490 --> 24:23.445
- This isn't happening!
- No, just don't answer it. It's okay.

24:23.522 --> 24:26.170
- I have to. It's the office,
baby. They know I'm home.
- No.

24:26.247 --> 24:28.819
How could they possibly know
that you're home?

24:28.895 --> 24:31.044
It's the FBl.

24:32.924 --> 24:34.958
Stanley!

24:35.035 --> 24:37.606
Goodspeed.
Uh, yeah. O-Okay, yeah.

24:37.645 --> 24:39.948
I'll be, I'll be down, yeah,
downstairs in ten minutes.

24:39.987 --> 24:42.633
No, you won't.

24:44.245 --> 24:48.007
- I have to go to San Francisco.
- No, you don't.

24:48.084 --> 24:51.077
Stanley, no, you do not have
to go to San Francisco.

24:51.154 --> 24:54.147
Are you kidding me right now?
You need to stay here
and talk to me about things.

24:54.223 --> 24:57.677
-I've got to go, baby.
-Oh! I am Catholic! Do you realize that?

24:57.755 --> 25:01.824
I am pregnant and I am unmarried. And
this causes a serious problem for me.

25:01.900 --> 25:03.819
I cannot believe you.

25:12.454 --> 25:14.295
No, no.

25:16.368 --> 25:19.554
I love you.
I will marry you.

25:19.631 --> 25:22.241
I just didn't plan on this, that's all.

25:23.815 --> 25:26.232
- Come to San Francisco.
- Really?

25:26.308 --> 25:28.189
Yeah, I'm sure it's just
a training exercise.

25:28.228 --> 25:30.491
Check into the hotel.
Order up some champagne.

25:30.530 --> 25:32.487
- And we'll finish what we started?
- Exactly.

25:32.563 --> 25:34.253
- Baby, you're gonna marry me?
- You know it.

25:34.331 --> 25:36.901
You're gonna marry me!

25:36.978 --> 25:40.662
- Oh, honey, come on.
Just a really quick one.
- Oh, oh, I gotta go now.

25:40.739 --> 25:43.693
A nighttime airdrop incursion
is out due to the full moon.

25:43.770 --> 25:45.614
Likewise a frontal
seaside attack.

25:45.690 --> 25:48.874
If we're compromised and shots
are fired, Hummel might launch.

25:48.952 --> 25:51.523
Our only alternative
is an attack from within the prison.

25:51.599 --> 25:54.977
We penetrate the island
through the tunnels under the
prison buildings undetected...

25:55.054 --> 25:57.894
and emerge in its center; that way
we can jump the marines from behind.

25:57.933 --> 26:01.578
And if we're lucky, take their
rocket positions without a shot fired.

26:01.616 --> 26:04.033
I don't understand. You-you've studied
the architectural plans?

26:04.111 --> 26:07.911
They're useless. Alcatraz has been
ripped up and rebuilt for years.

26:07.987 --> 26:10.826
- Under there is a maze of shit.
- Well, there's no question, gentlemen.

26:10.905 --> 26:13.321
We need firsthand intelligence
of the tunnel systems.

26:13.399 --> 26:16.660
- So what about the former warden?
- Died in 1979.

26:16.699 --> 26:18.771
All the guards we contacted
were useless.

26:18.848 --> 26:23.646
Um, there is someone
who I think can help us.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.711
- This is for the sake
of national security.
- No!

26:28.787 --> 26:32.358
It's the sake of national
security that got us here
in the first place 33 years ago.

26:32.434 --> 26:35.158
I knew! I knew someday
this would come back to bite us.

26:35.197 --> 26:37.999
Forget it!
He does not exist.

26:38.075 --> 26:41.414
He does exist! We just chose
to forget him for 30 years.

26:41.490 --> 26:44.523
- We locked him up
and threw away the key.
- Oh, and a lot of goddamn good
it did us.

26:44.600 --> 26:48.207
He broke out of two maximum-security
prisons. And if he hits the streets--

26:48.283 --> 26:50.509
He's not gonna hit the streets, Jim.

26:50.586 --> 26:53.503
Thirty years ago he was
a highly-trained SAS operative.

26:53.580 --> 26:55.309
He is my age now,
for Christ's sake!

26:55.385 --> 26:58.186
I have to get up three times
a night to take a piss.

26:58.225 --> 27:01.257
We can't risk
letting him out.

27:01.333 --> 27:04.864
He's a professional
escape artist.

27:36.756 --> 27:39.827
- Gosh. Neat, uh--
- Yeah.
- Neat, neat plane.

27:39.865 --> 27:41.746
Dr. Goodspeed.
James Womack.

27:41.822 --> 27:43.396
- A pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

27:43.474 --> 27:45.276
You come very highly recommended.

27:45.315 --> 27:48.693
B.A. Columbia;
M.A., PhD, Johns Hopkins.

27:48.769 --> 27:50.764
Biochemistry, toxicology.

27:50.841 --> 27:53.299
Well, I'm one of those fortunate
people who like my job, sir.

27:53.375 --> 27:56.099
Got my first chemistry set when I
was seven. Blew my eyebrows off.

27:56.176 --> 27:59.016
We never saw the cat again.
Been into it ever since.

27:59.093 --> 28:00.820
What do you know about V.X. gas?

28:00.896 --> 28:04.121
Liquid. Failed pesticide
discovered by a mistake in 1952.

28:04.197 --> 28:05.655
Uh, actually, it's kind of like
champagne that way.

28:05.733 --> 28:07.306
The Franciscan monks thought
they were making white wine.

28:07.382 --> 28:09.301
Somehow the bottle carbonated.
Voila! Champagne.

28:09.379 --> 28:11.872
- And then the whole thing just--
- The gas, Dr. Goodspeed.

28:11.949 --> 28:14.098
It's very, very horrible, sir.

28:14.174 --> 28:16.478
It's one of those things
we wish we could disinvent.

28:17.898 --> 28:19.933
This isn't a "train" exercise, is it?

28:20.009 --> 28:24.268
No, Dr. Goodspeed,
it's not a training exercise.

29:00.228 --> 29:01.802
- Hello, sir.
- Good morning, Director.

29:01.879 --> 29:04.566
This is Ernest Paxton, agent in charge
of the West Coast operation.

29:04.604 --> 29:07.635
- Dr. Goodspeed.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- How do you do, sir?

29:07.711 --> 29:11.972
It's been a fairly interesting day
so far. The prisoner's here. Shall we?

29:12.009 --> 29:15.887
Now, my boys, they haven't been
able to find a file on this guy.
Who is he anyway, sir?

29:15.963 --> 29:18.688
His name is John Mason,
a British national...

29:18.766 --> 29:23.600
incarcerated on Alcatraz
in 1962, escaped in '63.

29:23.678 --> 29:26.211
I was under the impression that no one
ever escaped Alcatraz, sir.

29:26.250 --> 29:28.437
Paxton, don't argue!

29:28.513 --> 29:32.467
This man has no identity, not in
the United States or Great Britain.

29:32.543 --> 29:35.038
He does not exist. Understand?

29:35.115 --> 29:37.265
I want one thing:
how he escaped The Rock.

29:37.341 --> 29:40.296
Specifically the route he took
through the island's bowels.

29:40.372 --> 29:43.672
- The papers are in order, sir.
- We're prepared to offer him
a full pardon.

29:43.750 --> 29:48.202
And Paxton, no strong-arming Mason.
I know him too well.

29:48.241 --> 29:50.543
Well, if you know him,
then why don't you question him?

29:50.619 --> 29:55.147
No, he'll remember me. I don't want
his anger clouding the issue.

29:55.186 --> 29:56.607
All right, I'll take care of him.

30:04.474 --> 30:08.695
Mr. Mason, I'm Special Agent
in Charge, Ernest Paxton.

30:08.733 --> 30:12.917
In charge of what? Fucking me over
for another three decades?

30:12.956 --> 30:15.833
I don't know anything about your
previous matters. I'm here because...

30:15.910 --> 30:19.173
a special situation exists that we feel
you might be able to help us with.

30:19.249 --> 30:21.091
Well, what might that be?

30:21.167 --> 30:25.313
I've been in jail longer than
Nelson Mandela, so maybe you
want me to run for president.

30:25.390 --> 30:28.576
- Not exactly.
- Mmm, a pity.

30:28.614 --> 30:30.571
I feel rather like Alcamenes.

30:30.649 --> 30:34.870
- Who?
- Alcamenes. He was imprisoned
by his king in ancient Greece.

30:34.948 --> 30:39.015
-Like Sir Walter Raleigh. The same fate.
-James the First.

30:39.091 --> 30:42.507
Even someone as bright as you
must be aware that, uh,

30:42.583 --> 30:44.886
there's a certain pattern
emerging here.

30:44.964 --> 30:46.845
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn?

30:46.921 --> 30:50.182
Yeah, I heard of him. Didn't he play
hockey for the fuckin' Red Wings?

30:50.220 --> 30:53.252
- That's the chap.
- Get this straight, pops.

30:53.330 --> 30:55.977
I don't like you any more
than you like me.

30:56.016 --> 30:58.358
But I'm here to make you
a legitimate offer.

30:58.434 --> 31:00.583
You wanna hear what
I have to say or not?

31:00.660 --> 31:05.150
By all means, dear Paxton.
By all means.

31:05.226 --> 31:07.491
We got a problem in a place
that I think you know.

31:07.567 --> 31:10.255
There's a hostage situation
on Alcatraz.

31:10.331 --> 31:13.709
- Hostage?
- Eighty-one tourists.

31:13.785 --> 31:17.124
The Rock has become
a tourist attraction?

31:17.201 --> 31:20.002
Why don't we cut the shit, huh?
You know The Rock.

31:20.080 --> 31:23.342
- You broke out.
- Yes, successfully.

31:23.420 --> 31:26.259
Yeah. So why don't you do yourself
a favor while you're helpin' us?

31:26.335 --> 31:29.137
I mean, it'd be nice to get out of jail
while you're still vertical.

31:29.214 --> 31:32.284
Hmm? While you got a little lead
left in your pencil.

31:34.587 --> 31:36.583
While I'm considering your offer...

31:36.659 --> 31:40.688
I want a suite
in the Fairmont Hotel.

31:40.766 --> 31:44.374
You know I'm here
to cut you a deal.

31:44.450 --> 31:48.441
I am not here to bend over
and take it up the ass from you.

31:48.517 --> 31:51.089
Here. Here's a quarter.

31:55.235 --> 31:59.801
Do yourself a favor. Call your lawyer.
You're goin' back to jail.

32:03.178 --> 32:05.635
- Y-You're sending him back to jail?
- I'm not sending him anywhere.

32:05.711 --> 32:07.899
I'm just givin' him
somethin' to think about.

32:07.975 --> 32:09.702
With all due respect, sir,
I don't think we have time...

32:09.740 --> 32:11.085
for him to just sit around
and think about it.

32:11.123 --> 32:14.269
- Oh, really?
- No, Goodspeed's right.

32:14.345 --> 32:16.457
- You go talk to him.
- Me?
- Yes.

32:16.496 --> 32:18.990
- Sir, I'm not qualified for that.
- You're an FBI agent!

32:19.067 --> 32:21.101
- W-What is your specialty again?
- Chemical weapons.

32:21.177 --> 32:23.826
Don't mention that!

32:27.548 --> 32:29.658
- You want me to lie?
- Yeah, lie.

32:31.002 --> 32:34.265
We got less than 24 hours.
Give it a shot.

32:35.799 --> 32:37.679
Okay.

32:42.400 --> 32:44.665
Hi.

32:44.703 --> 32:48.617
I'm an agent with the, uh,
uh, F-Federal--

32:48.695 --> 32:51.457
FBl. Uh--

32:51.495 --> 32:55.104
- Eh, well, my-- I'm Stanley Goodspeed.
- But of course you are.

32:55.181 --> 32:57.597
Well, at least
he got his name right.

32:57.675 --> 33:01.282
- Of course I am. Huh.
- And you have an emergency.

33:01.358 --> 33:04.622
That's right.

33:04.698 --> 33:06.847
And you need my help.

33:06.885 --> 33:08.804
Exactly right.

33:10.263 --> 33:13.179
- Coffee.
- No, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

33:13.256 --> 33:16.096
Offer me coffee.

33:16.174 --> 33:18.783
Oh, yes! Well, that was,
in fact, gonna be my next--

33:18.859 --> 33:21.509
Can we get a cup of coffee
in here, please?

33:21.585 --> 33:24.347
And offer to take these off.

33:25.115 --> 33:26.613
Mr. Mason, really.

33:26.689 --> 33:30.258
- All kidding aside.
- As a gesture of your good faith.

33:32.792 --> 33:36.552
- Prisoner requests to have
his handcuffs taken off.
- No, no, no, no.

33:38.662 --> 33:40.850
Why don't you go ahead and have
his handcuffs taken off, please?

33:40.928 --> 33:43.538
Well, I guess
that's one way to go.

33:45.916 --> 33:49.523
This is a pardon and release contract
from the Attorney General's office.

33:49.562 --> 33:53.478
Now, it makes you a free man
provided you cooperate.

33:53.554 --> 33:56.777
So if you'll just, uh, sign...

33:56.853 --> 33:58.773
uh, at, uh, where it says--

33:58.850 --> 34:01.997
- "Signature"?
- That's-- Yes. "Signature."

34:02.073 --> 34:06.833
Well, timeo danaos et dona ferentis.

34:06.910 --> 34:09.827
"l fear the Greeks
even when they bring gifts."

34:09.902 --> 34:12.436
Oh, an educated man!

34:12.512 --> 34:17.387
That rules out the possibility
of you being a field agent.

34:17.464 --> 34:20.228
In point of fact,
I am a field agent, Mr. Mason.

34:20.304 --> 34:22.568
- Really?
- Yes.

34:22.606 --> 34:26.177
- In which field?
- Antiterrorism.

34:26.253 --> 34:30.166
Then you're trained in weaponry,
explosives and mortal combat.

34:31.280 --> 34:34.004
Well-trained.

34:34.081 --> 34:36.920
Then it's the Fairmont Hotel.

34:38.918 --> 34:40.337
Okay.

34:40.375 --> 34:44.174
I want a suite,
a shower, a shave...

34:44.213 --> 34:46.054
and the feel of a suit.

34:46.132 --> 34:49.202
May I also suggest, uh, a haircut?

34:49.280 --> 34:53.424
- Am I out of style?
- Unless you're a 20-year-old
guitarist from Seattle.

34:53.501 --> 34:55.650
- It's a grunge thing.
- Grunge?

34:55.726 --> 34:58.604
Yeah, well, uh, uh--
Okay, thank you very much.

34:58.682 --> 35:03.173
All right. Call the Fairmont.
Close the floor if necessary,
but I want him sealed off.

35:03.249 --> 35:06.126
And he gets two hours max.

35:20.288 --> 35:23.398
-Great job, Goodspeed.
-Why didn't you throw in a trip
to Tahiti while you were at it?

35:23.474 --> 35:26.776
- I'll deliver this
to the Attorney General.
- Uh, no, you'll give it to me.
Give it to me, Reynolds.

35:26.852 --> 35:31.496
And take Attorney Reynolds
outside. There's a car
waiting for you. Thank you.

35:33.721 --> 35:37.176
That's a signed federal document, sir.
Isn't that illegal?

35:37.252 --> 35:39.669
You're not acquainted
with the full facts, Goodspeed.

35:39.747 --> 35:43.968
With all due respect, sir, I'd like
clarification. I gave that man my word.

35:44.044 --> 35:49.188
Damn it! You're on a need-to-know basis,
and you don't need to know.

35:49.264 --> 35:52.143
It's, uh, it's, eh,
kind of curious, but, uh,

35:52.220 --> 35:54.445
Sir Walter Raleigh,
Alcamenes, Solzhenitsyn,

35:54.522 --> 35:57.286
they, um, well, they were all
wrongfully imprisoned.

36:05.843 --> 36:10.833
Womack! Now, why am I not surprised,
you piece of shit!

36:10.872 --> 36:13.097
Eh, peace! Peace!

36:20.350 --> 36:22.538
Hey, we're not home.
Leave a message.

36:22.614 --> 36:24.687
Hi, darling, it's, uh, it's me.

36:24.764 --> 36:27.680
Uh, listen, don't come
to San Francisco.

36:27.757 --> 36:30.175
I repeat, do not come
to San Francisco.

36:30.252 --> 36:31.748
- Stanley, no!
- Carla.
- Wha--

36:31.825 --> 36:33.246
- Carla.
- Like hell I'm not coming!

36:33.284 --> 36:35.663
Wait. Car--

36:39.732 --> 36:43.645
Who's Carla? And why don't you
want her to come to San Francisco?

36:49.019 --> 36:52.319
You're on a need-to-know basis,
and you don't need to know.

36:52.358 --> 36:55.235
Watch it, he'll bite you.

37:02.681 --> 37:06.481
Good. Mobile Command
is fully operational.

37:06.557 --> 37:09.934
- We'll be there in
approximately two hours.
- I'm not armed, sir.
- Right.

37:10.012 --> 37:12.659
- I am unarmed, sir.
- Well, where's your issue?

37:13.888 --> 37:16.765
I left it in my,
uh, my sock drawer.

37:17.993 --> 37:19.645
A gun?

37:19.721 --> 37:23.252
For what?
You're a chemical freak.

37:23.328 --> 37:27.665
No, I'm a chemical super-freak,
actually. But I still need a gun.

37:28.548 --> 37:30.814
Give him a goddamn gun.

37:32.655 --> 37:35.648
Have you fired one of
those things since the Academy?

37:35.726 --> 37:39.679
- Wear some flowers in your hair
- If you're going to San Francisco

37:39.717 --> 37:42.327
Don't forget to wear
flowers in your hair

37:42.405 --> 37:44.823
- If you're going
- If you're going

37:44.899 --> 37:49.313
- To San Francisco
- To San Francisco

37:49.389 --> 37:52.766
- You're sure to meet
some gentle people there
- You're gonna meet

37:52.842 --> 37:58.330
- Some gentle people there
- And you come for--

37:58.408 --> 38:01.171
If you're going
to San Francisco

38:01.247 --> 38:03.627
Uh, uh, room service?

38:03.665 --> 38:07.964
Ah, listen. This is the penthouse.
Do you do snacks, drinks? Huh?

38:08.079 --> 38:10.151
Hello!

38:10.227 --> 38:12.454
- You the barber?
- No. Stylist.

38:12.530 --> 38:14.986
Barber.

38:15.063 --> 38:18.787
- Just clippers. No scissors.
- No scissors? You've got to be
kidding me, no scissors!

38:18.863 --> 38:21.088
I mean, did they tell Picasso,
"No brush"?

38:21.165 --> 38:22.931
With scissors,
this man could kill you.

38:22.970 --> 38:27.574
I can't cut anyone's balls off
with a trimmer now, can l?

38:27.652 --> 38:30.645
Why don't we do this outside?
Get some sun.

38:32.794 --> 38:36.747
Oh, who did this to you? This is
just not right. In fact, it's nasty!

38:36.823 --> 38:38.743
Well, it's a grunge thing.

38:38.819 --> 38:40.738
Well, it's some kind of thing.

38:40.816 --> 38:43.617
Do you think we have time for a sea kelp
protein pack and maybe some color?

38:43.694 --> 38:45.881
No.

38:45.919 --> 38:49.642
Okay. Not very nice, is he?

38:49.718 --> 38:51.638
No, he's not.

39:05.454 --> 39:07.909
'Cause I'm leavin'

39:07.987 --> 39:10.290
Hey, somebody ordered it.
Can't let it go to waste.

39:10.366 --> 39:13.359
- Don't know when I'll be back again
- Don't you ever stop eatin'?

39:13.436 --> 39:15.547
Not when it's free.

39:15.625 --> 39:18.732
- We're supposed to be on duty.
- Hey, don't worry. He's an old man.

39:18.809 --> 39:21.649
The boss is watchin' 'im. Come on.
Have-- Try some of this lobster.

39:21.688 --> 39:25.871
-Mm-hmm.
-My secretary here will settle the bill.

39:25.947 --> 39:29.172
So what do you have in store for me,
Womack, when this is over?

39:29.211 --> 39:31.974
You'll get your life back, Mason.

39:32.050 --> 39:34.774
But you could've given me
my life back years ago.

39:38.843 --> 39:43.333
- Why should I trust you now?
- You've got my word.

39:43.411 --> 39:46.442
Will you shake on it?

39:56.765 --> 39:59.721
- Freeze, mister!
- Oh, man!

40:00.641 --> 40:02.407
Help!

40:02.484 --> 40:05.248
Drop the gun,
or I drop your boss.

40:05.324 --> 40:08.394
You will not!

40:08.470 --> 40:10.275
Get!

40:10.351 --> 40:12.885
- He's getting very heavy.
- Then pull him up.

40:17.144 --> 40:19.985
Please don't!

40:20.061 --> 40:22.747
Help! Shit!

40:22.823 --> 40:25.473
Come on. Have a scallop.
Come on. Catch.

40:32.726 --> 40:35.372
You hoist him!

40:35.411 --> 40:37.332
Help! Help! Help!

40:37.408 --> 40:39.519
- Where's Mason? Where is Mason?
- Help! Hang on!

40:39.595 --> 40:42.742
- Where's Mason?
- Mason's gone!
- Gone?

40:44.853 --> 40:46.887
Clear.

40:47.579 --> 40:49.459
Living room's clear!

40:49.535 --> 40:52.720
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

40:52.759 --> 40:55.560
All units, this is Caretaker.
We have a Signal Six. He's in the hotel!

41:01.700 --> 41:05.807
Okay, I don't wanna know
nothin'. I never saw you throw
that gentleman off the balcony.

41:05.883 --> 41:09.913
All I care about is, a-are
you happy with your haircut?

41:10.950 --> 41:12.640
Easy!

41:14.021 --> 41:17.513
Watch it, you fuckhead,
you're gonna pull my arm out!

41:18.818 --> 41:21.121
Watch out!

41:26.072 --> 41:27.531
Oh, no!

41:34.362 --> 41:36.320
Watch it!

41:39.849 --> 41:42.844
- Hey, watch it!
- He's over there!

41:58.579 --> 42:00.498
Hey!

42:00.574 --> 42:05.869
This is my Humvee. I don't want
any dings, dents or scratches,
or I'll have your ass. Hey!

42:05.947 --> 42:07.559
Hey! Stop! Hey!

42:12.741 --> 42:14.621
Hey, I was inside the bedroom
with Jack Powell!

42:14.697 --> 42:16.347
Hey, call the guard! Go!

42:19.264 --> 42:21.336
FBl.

42:31.546 --> 42:33.195
Move!

42:40.948 --> 42:42.175
Whoa! Whoa!

42:42.252 --> 42:45.668
Suspect is in a black Humvee,
heading west on California.

42:45.746 --> 42:47.779
Speed approximately
70 miles per hour.

42:54.572 --> 42:58.026
Get out of the way!

42:59.982 --> 43:02.400
I want a net put on this
son of a bitch, you hear me?

43:34.141 --> 43:36.979
This guy's hittin' every fuckin' thing
in sight tryin' to block us!

44:13.131 --> 44:16.318
I hope you're insured!

44:24.529 --> 44:26.679
Oh, well, why not?

44:41.724 --> 44:44.142
You're goin' down!

45:05.480 --> 45:08.435
Hello?

45:08.511 --> 45:10.853
I'm only borrowing your Humvee!

45:14.882 --> 45:18.299
Information? San Francisco?

45:18.375 --> 45:21.407
Uh, Jade Angelou.
That's A-N-G--

45:23.402 --> 45:25.743
Welcome aboard, y'all.
How y'all doin' today?

45:28.622 --> 45:31.078
Hang on!

45:34.648 --> 45:36.336
Holy shit!

45:45.815 --> 45:47.889
Whoa-oa!

45:49.462 --> 45:52.340
Oh, no!

45:56.062 --> 45:58.289
We're gonna crash!
Save yourselves!

46:03.624 --> 46:05.696
Oh, my baby!

46:09.342 --> 46:11.222
Oh, no!

46:24.041 --> 46:26.919
Oh, no.

46:30.604 --> 46:32.484
Oh, God!

46:33.365 --> 46:35.170
Oh, God!

46:53.207 --> 46:56.660
Hey, man, you just fucked up
your Ferrari.

46:56.738 --> 47:00.500
- Oh, no! Baby's goin' down in flames!
- It's not mine.

47:00.576 --> 47:02.149
Neither is this!

47:06.063 --> 47:09.365
Damn! This sucks!
Where's that son of a bitch at?

47:09.403 --> 47:13.010
I'm gonna hunt him down!
That motherfucker ain't safe nowhere.

47:14.776 --> 47:19.036
- Chem weapons. Isherwood.
- Marvin, look up Wolfburg
Federal Penitentiary.

47:19.112 --> 47:21.032
The inmate is Mason, John.

47:21.108 --> 47:23.948
Hey, Stan, listen, I'm gettin'
out of this government shithole.

47:24.024 --> 47:26.864
I'm goin' over to Orkin to
design roach motels. Cool, huh?

47:26.942 --> 47:28.438
Look, I just stole
a kid's motorcycle.

47:28.514 --> 47:30.896
I'm not really feeling too good
about it, okay? Wolfburg. Got it?

47:30.972 --> 47:35.233
Yeah, I got it. All right,
Magrane, Masconi, Masters. No Mason.

47:35.309 --> 47:39.913
Go to February '76. Who was transferred
to Wolfburg from San Quentin?

47:41.526 --> 47:43.636
This is weird.
They got medical records.

47:43.713 --> 47:48.856
They got place of birth. Glasgow.
Uh, but they don't have a name.

47:48.933 --> 47:50.545
Uh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
They have next of kin.

47:50.621 --> 47:54.728
A Jade Angelou
of 32 Stenson Drive, San Francisco.

48:13.649 --> 48:15.298
Jade?

48:15.375 --> 48:18.945
No, Stacy. Jade's friend.

48:24.050 --> 48:26.237
Were you afraid
to come alone?

48:26.313 --> 48:28.232
Yeah.

48:29.845 --> 48:32.915
- It's okay.
- I'll be over here if you need me.

48:32.991 --> 48:36.983
The last photograph I had of you,
you were about ten.

48:37.021 --> 48:38.863
Yeah?

48:38.940 --> 48:43.776
Well, I found a picture of you
among my mom's things when she died.

48:45.119 --> 48:49.954
Oh, yeah? Well, uh--
Why don't we take a walk?

48:50.030 --> 48:52.833
I got 'im.
Palace of Fine Arts.

48:52.871 --> 48:56.863
Your mother, uh-- Yeah, well,
sh-she was very special.

48:56.940 --> 48:59.204
Yeah, she was.

48:59.280 --> 49:03.233
But I don't think that we
should romanticize what happened
between you and her.

49:03.309 --> 49:06.111
Meeting in a bar
after a Led Zeppelin concert.

49:06.188 --> 49:08.836
Head out, and I was the result.

49:08.875 --> 49:11.677
Well, I'd like to think it
would've led somewhere if only--

49:11.753 --> 49:14.823
If only what? Six federal marshals
hadn't kicked down our door...

49:14.862 --> 49:17.357
and dragged you back to prison?

49:18.432 --> 49:21.309
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

49:22.500 --> 49:26.451
- So, they let you out?
- Yeah.

49:26.528 --> 49:28.449
That's good.

49:30.366 --> 49:32.900
What did you do?

49:32.976 --> 49:34.628
J--

49:37.620 --> 49:42.840
Jade, I don't have
a great deal of time here.

49:42.917 --> 49:45.565
But I'll be coming back.
And, uh--

49:45.642 --> 49:49.171
- Maybe we can--
- What? We can what?

49:50.592 --> 49:54.968
You know, you're almost
the only evidence...

49:55.045 --> 49:57.385
that I exist.

49:57.462 --> 49:59.265
But I don't know you.

49:59.342 --> 50:01.338
That's what I want to change, eh?

50:06.136 --> 50:10.050
I've rehearsed this speech a thousand
times on the chance that we would meet.

50:10.088 --> 50:12.889
Here we are, and I'm lost.

50:12.967 --> 50:15.730
Well, I don't know how
I'm supposed to be feeling either.

50:16.537 --> 50:19.644
Jade, I'm not an evil man.

50:19.721 --> 50:22.792
If you can believe that,
then it's a start.

50:26.475 --> 50:28.165
Okay.

50:38.681 --> 50:41.021
Is this about you?

50:52.304 --> 50:57.523
You broke out of prison again,
didn't you? Why did you come to me?

50:57.600 --> 51:01.247
FBl, ma'am.
Your father's working with us.

51:01.323 --> 51:03.280
He's helping us resolve
a dangerous situation.

51:03.356 --> 51:05.659
- He is?
- Yes, ma'am.

51:05.737 --> 51:08.575
Well, gee whiz, John,
I guess we oughta get goin', huh?

51:08.653 --> 51:11.032
Whatever you say, Stanley.

51:17.020 --> 51:19.398
Thank you for that.
You could've handled it differently.

51:19.437 --> 51:22.545
What do you say we cut
the chitchat, a-hole?

51:22.622 --> 51:26.499
You almost got me killed twice.
And my jaw hurts like hell!

51:27.535 --> 51:29.376
- Good.
- Cocksucker!

51:29.415 --> 51:32.140
If I had my way, you would be shipped
back to Wolfburg in leg irons...

51:32.217 --> 51:35.519
and caged like an animal for the rest
of your natural fucking life!

51:35.595 --> 51:38.589
You wrecked half the city!

51:41.889 --> 51:43.961
Now, tell me about the tunnels.

51:44.038 --> 51:49.105
If you know the system, it will
take you wherever you need to go.

51:49.181 --> 51:53.134
All right, there's an intake pipe here,
below low tide. Is that our best access?

51:53.210 --> 51:55.436
Yes. That's exactly
where I had come out.

51:55.475 --> 51:58.816
Then beneath the cistern,
there's a connection
to the abandoned septic system.

51:58.892 --> 52:00.504
How many feet is that?

52:00.580 --> 52:03.650
Uh, 57 paces.

52:03.689 --> 52:05.761
Where do we go from there?

52:08.446 --> 52:11.594
Where do we go from there?

52:11.672 --> 52:14.050
That's a good question.

52:15.394 --> 52:18.693
- I have no idea.
- What?

52:18.771 --> 52:21.919
I mean, I'll know it
when we're all inside.

52:21.995 --> 52:25.296
No. You're not goddamn goin'.
Show us on the blueprints.

52:25.373 --> 52:29.516
I can't! My blueprint
was in my head.

52:29.554 --> 52:32.779
I was underground
for three days in the dark...

52:32.855 --> 52:35.350
just waiting for the tides
to be right.

52:35.426 --> 52:38.765
But don't worry.
It'll all come back to me.

52:38.843 --> 52:41.338
You're not going anywhere, Mason.

52:41.414 --> 52:46.480
Wait a second. Now, this piece
of work might be the only chance
those people over there have.

52:46.556 --> 52:49.051
If he's not going, then why the
hell did we get him out of jail?

52:49.128 --> 52:52.467
- He's smart.
- I got him out to get you
people in, not go with you.

52:52.543 --> 52:56.534
If it's the only way of getting
the intelligence I need, then he goes.

52:56.612 --> 52:58.300
He'll fuck with you.

52:58.378 --> 53:02.022
You compromise my men's lives,
and I'll bury you out there.

53:03.980 --> 53:05.936
Now, Womack...

53:06.014 --> 53:08.586
you're between The Rock
and a hard case.

53:11.310 --> 53:13.920
How is your bowling arm?

53:15.302 --> 53:17.526
Dr. Goodspeed, the goal is
to take out the launchers,

53:17.604 --> 53:19.523
then neutralize
the V.X. chemical rounds.

53:19.562 --> 53:23.015
Well, we know the poison's being
kept in the prison morgue from
the satellite thermal imaging...

53:23.092 --> 53:25.702
which is right here;
these colorized dots.

53:25.778 --> 53:29.885
-Have you ever actually seen
one of these devices?
-No, sir, but I've studied them.

53:29.961 --> 53:33.262
I should really begin briefing your guys
on defusing and detoxification.

53:33.339 --> 53:35.911
Got a really neat layout over here of
the chem round as well as the rocket...

53:35.989 --> 53:38.751
- so let's get rolling.
- That won't be necessary.

53:41.130 --> 53:43.664
Oh, it's very necessary, sir.

53:43.702 --> 53:46.926
The power of this chemical
is way beyond anything you can imagine.

53:46.965 --> 53:48.614
An ecological disaster, sir.

53:48.691 --> 53:51.033
Plus the devices themselves
are complicated.

53:51.109 --> 53:52.528
That's why you're
coming with us.

53:56.559 --> 54:00.281
-I am?
-You're the expert. What's your problem?

54:00.319 --> 54:04.848
You mean I'm going, going out there,
under the water?

54:04.924 --> 54:07.074
Well, earlier today
you wanted a gun.

54:07.151 --> 54:09.339
Now you're getting a gun
and a wet suit.

54:09.377 --> 54:11.986
Have you ever been
in a combat situation?

54:12.062 --> 54:14.480
- Define "combat," sir.
- Shep?

54:14.558 --> 54:17.936
An incursion underwater to
retake an impregnable fortress
held by an elite team...

54:18.013 --> 54:21.082
of U.S. Marines in possession
of 81 hostages and 15 guided rockets...

54:21.158 --> 54:24.114
armed with V.X. poisoned gas.

54:24.190 --> 54:27.835
Oh. In that case, no, sir.
Excuse me.

54:34.015 --> 54:35.858
- Here.
- Ah, thank you.

54:38.504 --> 54:40.962
You don't look too good.

54:41.039 --> 54:43.648
In fact, you look like shit.

54:43.724 --> 54:46.871
My stomach's doing hula hoops
around my ass.

54:48.176 --> 54:50.173
You all right?

54:50.249 --> 54:52.322
I mean, you gonna make it
through this thing?

54:52.398 --> 54:54.393
I don't know.

54:54.471 --> 54:56.812
I always expected something
like this was going to happen...

54:56.850 --> 54:59.574
but nothing prepares you for it.

54:59.651 --> 55:01.915
Now I'm--
I'm responsible...

55:01.993 --> 55:03.874
for a whole city.

55:06.791 --> 55:08.479
Look, I know this
isn't easy for you.

55:08.555 --> 55:10.742
Remember, you were trained
for this kind of a situation...

55:10.819 --> 55:12.738
and believe me,
it'll come back to you.

55:12.815 --> 55:16.115
Besides, you got the best SEAL team
in the country backing you up.

55:16.154 --> 55:19.800
Okay. You're right.

55:19.838 --> 55:23.330
I-l'll be on the wire.
I'll help talk you through it.

55:23.408 --> 55:26.132
There's something else.

55:26.208 --> 55:29.625
It's terrible.
N-No, it's wonderful...

55:29.663 --> 55:32.043
except it isn't.

55:32.119 --> 55:35.267
My girlfriend's pregnant...

55:35.343 --> 55:39.106
and she's just flown in to see me.

55:39.145 --> 55:41.830
You keep your mind on what you're going
to be doing out there tonight.

55:41.869 --> 55:45.822
And I'll send someone to pick up
your girlfriend and bring her
here to the command center.

55:56.989 --> 56:00.713
Hummel!
- Hello, Frank. Lou Linstrom.

56:00.789 --> 56:04.358
I'm at the White House
with General Kramer.

56:04.435 --> 56:08.235
Uh, Frank, uh, we're havin' a few
problems with the account transfer.

56:08.272 --> 56:11.727
- Don't tell me problems.
Tell me solutions.
- Now, we've spoken to the president...

56:11.804 --> 56:14.030
and I know that you're
well aware of his stance on terrorism.

56:14.068 --> 56:19.133
- So what we'd like to do is--
- This isn't about terrorism.
This is about justice.

56:19.211 --> 56:21.743
It's about reminding you people
who found it politically
convenient to forget.

56:21.821 --> 56:24.084
This is goin' nowhere, Frank.

56:24.161 --> 56:25.811
Well, then, let me tell you what is.

56:25.889 --> 56:28.307
Fifteen V.X. gas rockets
into the heart of San Francisco.

56:28.383 --> 56:30.609
You've got 17 hours
to deliver the money.

56:30.647 --> 56:33.295
Or be prepared to reap
the whirlwind, gentlemen.

56:38.170 --> 56:40.855
- What's the word from Mojave?
- General Peterson can give us...

56:40.894 --> 56:43.926
no definite assurance
on the thermite plasma.

56:44.002 --> 56:46.036
That is the word.

56:50.527 --> 56:52.368
Green light to SEAL incursion.

57:09.753 --> 57:13.093
Fall in! All right, listen up.

57:13.170 --> 57:15.204
Mr. Mason will run point for us.

57:15.281 --> 57:17.200
Lieutenant Shepard
will be attached to his hip.

57:17.276 --> 57:21.114
You breathe, he breathes with you.
You piss, he helps.

57:21.190 --> 57:23.225
Understood?

57:23.302 --> 57:25.412
Dr. Goodspeed is our specialist.

57:25.488 --> 57:30.094
When he neutralizes the threat,
we launch green flares
and we wait for the cavalry.

57:30.171 --> 57:34.047
Make no mistake, gentlemen.
We're in the fight of our lives...

57:34.125 --> 57:36.965
against maybe the greatest
battalion commander in the Vietnam War.

57:37.042 --> 57:39.191
I shit you not.

57:39.267 --> 57:41.109
Any questions?

57:42.453 --> 57:44.679
Let's load up!

57:52.545 --> 57:54.848
After you, ace.

58:15.074 --> 58:17.799
Pass out and activate
the minicams.

58:20.178 --> 58:23.939
Everything set here?
Minicams operational?

58:25.014 --> 58:27.278
Roger that, sir.
We are on-line.

58:30.847 --> 58:35.683
Shep, what's the status on the special
operational gear for Mr. Mason?

58:35.759 --> 58:40.709
Uh, let's see.
We have, uh...

58:40.787 --> 58:43.474
one quart of kerosene
in a squeeze bottle.

58:45.508 --> 58:51.034
Three washers and waterproof matches.

58:51.071 --> 58:54.334
Use the green flares to signal
when the threat has been neutralized.

58:54.373 --> 58:56.676
Now, this is atropine.
If you come in contact with the gas...

58:56.752 --> 58:58.901
you have 20 seconds
to inject it into your heart.

58:58.979 --> 59:02.163
Don't fuck with me on this.
It may save your life.

59:05.578 --> 59:08.574
I have three incoming bogeys
bearing 275.

59:08.651 --> 59:10.953
Range: 6,000 meters.

59:14.215 --> 59:17.131
FBI Command Center?

59:17.208 --> 59:20.241
- Oh, I would just love for you
to tell me what is goin' on.
- Nope.

59:20.317 --> 59:23.886
Listen, Stanley Goodspeed
is my boyfriend.
Actually, he's, um, my fiance.

59:23.962 --> 59:25.844
- Where is he?
- Classified, lady.

59:25.882 --> 59:28.760
Okay. Well, you just sit here
and act like a Bureau bonehead, then.

59:28.836 --> 59:30.949
Hey, where are you g--
Goddamn it!

59:35.783 --> 59:38.278
Decoy choppers
commencing run to Alcatraz.

59:39.929 --> 59:42.002
I just lost one, sir.
I just lost one.

59:42.079 --> 59:45.916
- We only got two flying in.
I just lost one.
- Shit!

59:55.127 --> 59:58.619
In my day, we did it all
with a snorkel and a pair of flippers.

59:58.696 --> 01:00:01.920
- Your day?
- Yes. Didn't you read my resume?

01:00:01.997 --> 01:00:04.952
I don't--
I don't know anything about you.

01:00:05.028 --> 01:00:07.370
- Hmm. I know something
about you, Godspell.
- Goodspeed.

01:00:07.446 --> 01:00:10.977
Goodspeed, Godspeed,
Godspell...

01:00:11.053 --> 01:00:13.663
you never went to
any antiterrorist school.

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:16.580
So just make sure you don't
get us all fucking killed.

01:00:19.267 --> 01:00:22.413
- We're goin' dark.
- Night vision!

01:00:23.948 --> 01:00:26.174
Raider One has dropped
below radar coverage...

01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:28.093
heading around
Treasure lsland.

01:00:29.936 --> 01:00:33.043
Sir, we've got two bogeys
bearing due east and closing.

01:00:38.186 --> 01:00:39.569
Decoys?

01:00:39.608 --> 01:00:42.485
- Prepare to deploy!
- Good luck, Commander.

01:00:47.358 --> 01:00:49.238
Sir, Raider One
is at the drop zone.

01:00:51.542 --> 01:00:54.536
Stanley's not a very good swimmer.
I mean, he can't even snorkel.

01:00:56.032 --> 01:00:57.951
- Everyone, good to go?
- Good to go!

01:00:58.027 --> 01:01:01.635
- Good to go!
- Good to go! Good to go!

01:01:10.692 --> 01:01:13.378
All right, so the S.D.U.s
have been deployed,
and the Eagles are in the water.

01:01:22.744 --> 01:01:25.122
Major, I want the perimeter patrolled
to the west end of the island.

01:01:25.161 --> 01:01:27.233
- Double-time it.
- Yes, sir. Hendrix!

01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:29.267
- You lead the patrol.
- Aye, aye, sir.

01:01:29.345 --> 01:01:31.301
Let's move. Move out!
Move out! Move out!

01:02:25.914 --> 01:02:29.291
The Eagles are on The Rock.
They've entered the cistern room.

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.466
Thank you very fucking much,
Mr. Mason.

01:02:37.542 --> 01:02:39.769
You've led us into a room
with no exit.

01:02:43.607 --> 01:02:46.409
- Any ideas, Dillinger?
- Figure it out soon.
We're sitting ducks.

01:02:46.448 --> 01:02:47.982
We're a little tight on time.

01:02:48.059 --> 01:02:51.206
You stand by the door
until I open it.

01:02:51.282 --> 01:02:54.392
I'd like to know how you plan
on accomplishing that?

01:02:55.389 --> 01:02:57.538
Through here.

01:03:03.409 --> 01:03:06.863
- You're shitting me.
- I memorized the timing.

01:03:06.941 --> 01:03:08.782
I just hope it hasn't been changed.

01:03:08.859 --> 01:03:11.700
You catch one of those flame bursts,
you're a corpse.

01:03:11.776 --> 01:03:14.923
- Thank you.
- Commander, you said never
to leave his sight, but, uh--

01:03:14.999 --> 01:03:16.958
Stand fast, Lieutenant.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.758
Have a nice day.

01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:44.897
- Where'd you dig up this guy?
- That's classified.

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.760
Clear here, sir.
No motion sensors tripped.

01:03:54.799 --> 01:03:58.407
- Nothing.
- Well, tell 'em to stay out there.

01:03:58.483 --> 01:04:00.709
Sweep forward!

01:04:09.268 --> 01:04:11.838
Looks like he fucked us, Commander.

01:04:11.916 --> 01:04:14.909
I knew it.
That son of a bitch jumped ship.

01:04:20.129 --> 01:04:21.971
Welcome to The Rock.

01:04:36.554 --> 01:04:38.856
- Mason.
- That's a no-no.

01:04:38.933 --> 01:04:42.579
That's the subway.
That'll drop you into the tunnels.

01:04:42.618 --> 01:04:44.690
Do it!

01:05:00.501 --> 01:05:03.840
Sir, the Eagles have breached
the tunnel system.

01:05:09.904 --> 01:05:12.398
You enjoying this?

01:05:12.475 --> 01:05:15.430
Well, it's certainly more enjoyable
than my average day.

01:05:15.507 --> 01:05:19.767
Reading philosophy,
avoiding gang rape in the washroom.

01:05:19.806 --> 01:05:23.642
Though it's less of a problem these
days. Maybe I'm losing my sex appeal.

01:05:27.941 --> 01:05:31.089
We've got seismic activity
in one of the storm grates. North side.

01:05:31.165 --> 01:05:33.852
Continue patrolling the area.

01:05:33.928 --> 01:05:35.771
Sweep forward!

01:05:37.037 --> 01:05:39.109
Commander, halt.
We've got movement.

01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:43.639
- They're hearing sounds above, sir.
- Stand fast.

01:05:43.716 --> 01:05:46.441
Down, down, down.

01:05:51.468 --> 01:05:53.963
West storm drain's clear.

01:05:58.107 --> 01:06:01.714
Ninety-seven paces
to the shower room.

01:06:05.783 --> 01:06:08.930
The Eagles are now at the access
tunnel. They're right under
the shower room, sir.

01:06:16.415 --> 01:06:18.449
Fiber optics.

01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:24.435
- Something's not right.
- I got a bad feeling about this.

01:06:43.202 --> 01:06:45.083
Quiet.

01:06:54.409 --> 01:06:57.326
Motion sensors.

01:06:57.402 --> 01:07:01.279
- Beams cutting across
the manhole covers.
- Deal with it.

01:07:05.423 --> 01:07:09.222
Commander, the beam is hitting
some sort of reflective device.

01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:11.985
Possibly a prism.

01:07:14.212 --> 01:07:17.320
I want to use a mirror
to cut the beam...

01:07:17.398 --> 01:07:21.541
send the beam back to its source,
and then I'm gonna move the prism.

01:07:25.764 --> 01:07:28.181
We've got motion on a trembler
in the shower room, sir.

01:07:28.259 --> 01:07:30.330
We've got visitors.
Let's move.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:36.663
Got it.
Good to go.

01:07:36.701 --> 01:07:40.808
- Fuck, man! I knew this
would happen! Fuck!
- Move!

01:07:40.884 --> 01:07:42.995
Stand fast.
We'll secure the area.

01:07:53.472 --> 01:07:56.811
They're entering
into the shower room, sir.

01:07:59.268 --> 01:08:01.763
They're securing the area.

01:08:09.706 --> 01:08:12.509
Just sit tight.

01:08:15.118 --> 01:08:17.843
Drop your weapons!
Drop 'em!

01:08:17.919 --> 01:08:20.029
- Stand fast!
- Hold your fire!

01:08:20.106 --> 01:08:22.103
- Drop your weapons!
- Hold your fire!

01:08:24.943 --> 01:08:28.397
It's a fucking trap.

01:08:28.473 --> 01:08:30.124
This is General Hummel.

01:08:30.162 --> 01:08:33.770
Drop your weapons. Drop 'em!

01:08:33.808 --> 01:08:36.724
Anderson here,
General Hummel.

01:08:36.801 --> 01:08:39.296
Commander. Team leader.

01:08:39.372 --> 01:08:42.251
Commander Anderson, if you have
any concern for the lives of your men...

01:08:42.327 --> 01:08:45.245
you will order them to safety their
weapons and place them on the deck.

01:08:45.322 --> 01:08:47.125
This is not happening.

01:08:47.202 --> 01:08:50.541
Sir, we know why
you're out here.

01:08:50.617 --> 01:08:52.881
God knows I agree with you.

01:08:52.919 --> 01:08:56.066
But like you, I swore to defend
this country against all enemies...

01:08:56.144 --> 01:09:01.018
foreign, sir, and domestic.

01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:04.471
General, we've spilled
the same blood in the same mud.

01:09:04.549 --> 01:09:07.388
You know goddamn well
I can't give that order.

01:09:07.426 --> 01:09:08.886
We're dead.

01:09:08.962 --> 01:09:12.340
Your unit is covered
from an elevated position, Commander.

01:09:12.416 --> 01:09:16.023
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Don't do anything stupid.

01:09:16.139 --> 01:09:18.441
No one has to die here.

01:09:18.517 --> 01:09:22.779
Men following the general, you're
under oath as United States Marines!

01:09:22.854 --> 01:09:25.770
Have you forgotten that?

01:09:25.846 --> 01:09:27.881
We all have shipmates
we remember.

01:09:27.959 --> 01:09:31.220
Some of them were shit on
and pissed on by the Pentagon.

01:09:31.298 --> 01:09:35.212
- But that doesn't give you
the right to mutiny!
- You call it what you want!

01:09:35.288 --> 01:09:39.165
You're down there, we're up here.
You walked into the wrong
goddamn room, Commander!

01:09:39.242 --> 01:09:41.122
- Stand fast!
- Goddamn it, Commander, one last time.

01:09:41.198 --> 01:09:43.273
You tell your men to safety
their weapons, drop 'em on the deck.

01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:45.805
- I cannot give that order!
- I am not gonna repeat that order!

01:09:45.883 --> 01:09:48.645
- I will not give that order!
- What the hell is wrong with you, man?

01:09:48.721 --> 01:09:51.410
- Stand fast!
- Oh, my God!

01:09:51.447 --> 01:09:54.826
- Let's waste these fuckers.
- One last time. You order your
men to safety their weapons--

01:10:02.001 --> 01:10:03.960
Cease fire!

01:10:22.304 --> 01:10:24.798
Don't go.

01:10:26.602 --> 01:10:28.482
Cease fire!

01:10:37.002 --> 01:10:38.845
Cease fire!

01:10:38.921 --> 01:10:40.994
Shit! Goddamn it!

01:10:41.032 --> 01:10:43.335
Let go of me.
Let go of me!

01:10:43.412 --> 01:10:45.446
Don't. Don't go.

01:11:32.612 --> 01:11:34.454
It's over.

01:11:43.895 --> 01:11:45.814
Oh, God!

01:12:04.083 --> 01:12:06.078
Later.

01:12:16.056 --> 01:12:18.437
- We got some movement.
- Who?
- Two of 'em!

01:12:18.475 --> 01:12:20.163
- Who is it?
- Eagles 11 and 12.

01:12:20.202 --> 01:12:22.848
- I-lt's Goodspeed and Mason.
- I knew it.

01:12:22.926 --> 01:12:25.537
I've gotta get a team together
right now. We've gotta move
with the second option.

01:12:25.613 --> 01:12:27.800
What, and invite
another massacre? No way.

01:12:27.877 --> 01:12:32.444
We've got a 60-year-old convict and
a lab rat. I'm telling you, it's over.

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:34.593
Not for Mason, it isn't.

01:12:45.952 --> 01:12:49.483
Goodspeed, I'm not gonna kill you.

01:12:51.901 --> 01:12:54.626
- Where are you going?
- Off this bloody island.

01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:57.235
What? Wh-Wh-What for?

01:12:57.313 --> 01:13:00.882
Goodspeed.
Goodspeed, do you read me?

01:13:00.921 --> 01:13:02.801
It's for you.

01:13:04.028 --> 01:13:06.255
- Sir?
- What's the status?

01:13:06.332 --> 01:13:09.018
The status is they're dead.
They're dead!

01:13:09.056 --> 01:13:11.051
It's just me and Mason.
Now he says he's leaving.

01:13:11.127 --> 01:13:15.274
That is unacceptable.
Do you hear me? Unacceptable!

01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:17.884
Well, there's a problem, sir.
He's got a gun.

01:13:17.921 --> 01:13:20.952
What do you have,
a fuckin' water pistol?

01:13:20.991 --> 01:13:23.641
- No, sir.
- Go after him and stop him.

01:13:25.598 --> 01:13:27.786
I didn't want this.

01:13:27.863 --> 01:13:30.434
- Jesus, I didn't want this.
- You knew this might happen, Frank.

01:13:30.472 --> 01:13:33.504
- Well, maybe now they'll pay up.
- Maybe now they won't, Captain.

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:35.998
Then maybe we need to execute
a few hostages.

01:13:36.076 --> 01:13:39.184
- Got a live one!
- Put a bullet in him.

01:13:39.261 --> 01:13:42.753
- You heard him. End it!
- Holster that sidearm, Captain.

01:14:00.409 --> 01:14:02.250
Sir?

01:14:05.589 --> 01:14:07.930
You made a terrible mistake.

01:14:08.006 --> 01:14:11.154
And more of our brothers
have died in vain.

01:14:11.193 --> 01:14:14.224
Damn you for forcing me
into this position.

01:14:17.485 --> 01:14:20.018
I need to talk to you
right now, alone.

01:14:20.094 --> 01:14:22.476
Now you told me
I'm on a need-to-know basis.

01:14:22.552 --> 01:14:27.617
And I'm tellin' you right now,
I need to know who the fuck
John Mason is right now, sir.

01:14:27.695 --> 01:14:31.646
All right, you wanna know?
1962, J. Edgar Hoover...

01:14:31.723 --> 01:14:34.410
is head of the FBl,
some say the country.

01:14:34.488 --> 01:14:38.287
It's no secret he kept microfilm files
on prominent Americans and Europeans:

01:14:38.363 --> 01:14:41.816
de Gaulle, British members
of Parliament, even the prime minister.

01:14:41.894 --> 01:14:44.888
I mean, this guy had dirt
on everybody in the world.

01:14:44.964 --> 01:14:48.419
Yeah, I know all the cloak-and-dagger
stories. Where does Mason fit in?

01:14:48.496 --> 01:14:51.143
Mason was the British operative
who stole the files.

01:14:51.219 --> 01:14:53.907
But our Bureau agents caught him
at the Canadian border.

01:14:53.983 --> 01:14:57.207
Of course, the British claimed
they'd never heard of him.

01:14:57.283 --> 01:14:59.164
And we held him
without trial...

01:14:59.242 --> 01:15:03.461
until he gave up the microfilm,
but he never did.

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:06.187
Well, I'm surprised Hoover
didn't use his daughter as leverage.

01:15:06.225 --> 01:15:09.410
Hoover was dead in '72.
She wasn't born yet.

01:15:09.488 --> 01:15:12.942
Today, well, it's
a different Bureau.

01:15:13.018 --> 01:15:17.163
So you held this guy without trial
his whole life! No wonder he's pissed.

01:15:17.239 --> 01:15:21.501
This man knows our most intimate secrets
from the last half century:

01:15:21.577 --> 01:15:25.683
the alien landing at Roswell, the truth
about the J.F.K. assassination.

01:15:25.721 --> 01:15:29.366
And Mason's angry, he's lethal,
he's a trained killer.

01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:34.817
And he is the only hope
that we have got.

01:15:34.893 --> 01:15:37.733
Mason! Mason!

01:15:39.767 --> 01:15:42.109
There are 81 hostages
still up there.

01:15:42.187 --> 01:15:43.951
Yeah, like me.

01:15:44.028 --> 01:15:46.560
All right, you wanna play tough?
You wanna play tough with me?

01:15:46.637 --> 01:15:49.363
Okay. FBl!
Freeze, sucker!

01:15:51.282 --> 01:15:55.388
- I'll fire.
- No, you won't.

01:15:55.427 --> 01:15:58.958
- Throw down.
- You're not the sort.

01:15:59.034 --> 01:16:01.721
Let's find out.

01:16:04.253 --> 01:16:07.785
I could; you, no.

01:16:07.861 --> 01:16:10.241
Besides, your safety's on.

01:16:10.317 --> 01:16:13.770
Goodspeed, have you
resolved the situation?

01:16:16.112 --> 01:16:18.645
Not yet.

01:16:18.722 --> 01:16:22.022
-He's got all the guns now, sir.
-Shit!

01:16:22.061 --> 01:16:24.517
You're right, I don't use guns
and I don't kick down doors.

01:16:24.593 --> 01:16:27.241
- This is what I do.
- I haven't got my glasses.

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:31.503
What it says
is Chemical Weapons Specialist.

01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:35.339
That's right.
I got a lunatic up there, man...

01:16:35.416 --> 01:16:38.832
with 15 missiles armed
with some really funky stuff.

01:16:38.908 --> 01:16:43.552
That lying Womack.
You could've told my daughter.

01:16:43.630 --> 01:16:47.966
It was classified.
Look, I'm in the same situation.

01:16:48.042 --> 01:16:51.152
They've got my girlfriend in
the city with a baby on the way.

01:16:51.228 --> 01:16:55.181
Look, I can defuse the rockets.
I really can.

01:16:55.257 --> 01:16:57.216
But I'm gonna need your help,
and I'm gonna need it right now.

01:17:05.583 --> 01:17:07.962
Sir, this man's weapons
and tack radio are missing!

01:17:08.039 --> 01:17:11.568
Shit, we got a rodent problem.
Flush the pipes.

01:17:11.646 --> 01:17:14.371
There's probably a maze of
tunnels on this goddamn island.
Check every access you can find.

01:17:14.449 --> 01:17:16.482
Sir.

01:17:21.931 --> 01:17:24.541
Even if you escape
from the island...

01:17:24.617 --> 01:17:27.727
you can't escape
the rockets.

01:17:27.803 --> 01:17:31.334
So, where are you gonna go? Go where?
What are, what are you gonna do?

01:17:35.133 --> 01:17:38.203
- Show me where the morgue is, Mason.
- I'm out of here.

01:17:41.466 --> 01:17:44.037
What about your daughter? Mason?

01:17:46.147 --> 01:17:48.565
Rodents located.

01:17:48.641 --> 01:17:52.788
The way I see it, you don't
really have any choice, do you?

01:17:52.826 --> 01:17:55.128
I don't think you do.

01:18:05.606 --> 01:18:07.717
Move!

01:18:31.242 --> 01:18:32.816
They're onto us.

01:18:32.892 --> 01:18:35.080
Burn 'em out.

01:18:37.153 --> 01:18:39.303
This mother's gonna blow big.

01:19:19.406 --> 01:19:22.670
I don't understand. How could
we lose radio contact all of a sudden?

01:19:22.746 --> 01:19:25.201
We've lost coms.
Still got 'em on locaters.

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:36.523
- So what's it gonna be?
- What?

01:19:36.599 --> 01:19:39.709
How do you like your choices?

01:19:39.747 --> 01:19:42.778
- I don't.
- That's what I thought.

01:19:42.854 --> 01:19:45.849
All right, come on.

01:19:46.002 --> 01:19:49.226
This is the oldest part
of Alcatraz.

01:19:49.304 --> 01:19:52.029
Did you know it was originally
a Civil War fort?

01:19:52.105 --> 01:19:54.946
Oh, really? Huh. Yeah, wow.
You know, I like history, too...

01:19:55.022 --> 01:19:58.246
and maybe when this is all over,
you and I can stop by
the souvenir shop together.

01:19:58.322 --> 01:20:02.429
But right now I just-- I just--
I wanna find some rockets.

01:20:03.849 --> 01:20:08.262
Don't tempt me.
We are going to the morgue.

01:20:30.866 --> 01:20:34.667
- You sure you're ready for this?
- I'll do my best.

01:20:34.743 --> 01:20:36.394
Your best?

01:20:36.433 --> 01:20:40.155
Losers always whine
about their best.

01:20:40.231 --> 01:20:43.035
Winners go home
and fuck the prom queen.

01:20:44.454 --> 01:20:46.295
Carla was the prom queen.

01:20:46.373 --> 01:20:49.903
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:20:51.399 --> 01:20:54.241
Locaters have them
approaching the morgue, sir.

01:20:54.318 --> 01:20:56.734
Come on, come on.
You can do it, Doc.

01:21:04.217 --> 01:21:06.406
You must never hesitate.

01:21:28.741 --> 01:21:31.889
I think you're shooting
too close to the rocket.

01:21:31.966 --> 01:21:33.808
Him, but not the rocket.

01:21:33.884 --> 01:21:36.032
Any other news, Professor?

01:21:38.605 --> 01:21:41.330
Not the rocket!
Not the rocket.

01:21:56.182 --> 01:21:58.447
I got a little somethin' for ya.

01:22:19.862 --> 01:22:23.775
Oh, yeah, okay. That's just about
the most awful thing I've ever seen.

01:22:25.465 --> 01:22:27.346
Mason...

01:22:29.264 --> 01:22:31.836
the second you don't
respect this, it kills you.

01:22:31.874 --> 01:22:33.907
Put it over there.

01:22:44.154 --> 01:22:46.803
You've been around a lot
of corpses. Is that normal?

01:22:48.069 --> 01:22:49.989
- What, the feet thing?
- Yeah, the feet thing.

01:22:50.065 --> 01:22:53.213
- Yeah, that happens.
- Well, I'm having kind of
a hard time concentrating.

01:22:53.289 --> 01:22:57.088
- Can you do something about it?
- Well, like what? Kill him again?

01:22:57.164 --> 01:22:59.966
Listen, I'm just a biochemist.

01:23:00.042 --> 01:23:03.958
And most of the time I work in a glass
jar and lead a very uneventful life.

01:23:04.035 --> 01:23:08.065
I drive a Volvo, a beige one.
But what I'm dealing with here...

01:23:08.141 --> 01:23:10.712
is one of the most deadly substances
the Earth has ever known.

01:23:10.788 --> 01:23:13.361
So what do you say you cut me
some friggin' slack?

01:23:29.057 --> 01:23:30.938
A really elegant
string-of-pearls configuration.

01:23:31.014 --> 01:23:33.662
Unfortunately, incredibly unstable.

01:23:33.738 --> 01:23:35.772
Well, what exactly does this stuff do?

01:23:35.850 --> 01:23:38.804
If the rocket renders it aerosol, it can
take out the entire city of people.

01:23:40.302 --> 01:23:44.561
Really? And what happens
if you drop one?

01:23:44.637 --> 01:23:47.978
Happily, it'll just wipe out
you and me.

01:23:48.054 --> 01:23:50.356
- How?
- It's a cholinesterase inhibitor.

01:23:50.433 --> 01:23:53.541
Stops the brain from
sending nerve messages down the
spinal cord within 30 seconds.

01:23:53.619 --> 01:23:56.574
Any epidermal exposure
or inhalation, and you'll know.

01:23:56.652 --> 01:24:00.988
A twinge at the small of your back as
the poison seizes your nervous system.

01:24:01.064 --> 01:24:02.869
Do not move that!

01:24:05.708 --> 01:24:08.318
Your muscles freeze,
you can't breathe.

01:24:08.395 --> 01:24:11.504
You spasm so hard you break
your own back, spit your guts out.

01:24:11.582 --> 01:24:14.268
But that's after
your skin melts off.

01:24:14.345 --> 01:24:16.647
My God.

01:24:16.685 --> 01:24:19.909
Oh, I think we'd like God
on our side at the moment, don't you?

01:24:21.828 --> 01:24:25.090
So what I'm doing now is removing
the guidance system chips...

01:24:25.168 --> 01:24:27.048
so the rocket will splash down
after 500 feet.

01:24:27.124 --> 01:24:29.197
All right, let me have that.

01:24:29.236 --> 01:24:33.187
You can let go of it. All right,
just back away. Just back away!

01:24:33.264 --> 01:24:36.297
Sir, morgue team
has not checked in.

01:24:38.982 --> 01:24:40.863
Blackbird One,
this is Blackbird. Over.

01:24:42.705 --> 01:24:45.585
Blackbird One, this is Blackbird.
Come in, goddamn it!

01:24:47.734 --> 01:24:51.110
Somebody's still there.
Let's move!

01:24:51.188 --> 01:24:53.412
Rats alive! Close on the morgue.
Close on the morgue.

01:24:53.490 --> 01:24:56.291
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go.

01:24:56.368 --> 01:24:58.595
Frye, Darrow, hustle up.
We got more company!

01:25:02.049 --> 01:25:03.929
Hold it.

01:25:04.005 --> 01:25:06.768
Converge on the morgue.
Move out.

01:25:07.843 --> 01:25:10.300
Goodspeed, come on.
Come over here.

01:25:10.337 --> 01:25:13.523
Good. I love pressure.
I eat it for breakfast.

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:15.249
Come on. Time's up.

01:25:15.327 --> 01:25:17.361
There's three rockets somewhere else.
We have to find them.

01:25:20.662 --> 01:25:22.312
Come on!

01:25:40.847 --> 01:25:43.034
Clear!

01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:45.991
I'm too old for this.

01:25:46.067 --> 01:25:49.637
- Where's it go?
- I've no idea.

01:25:49.713 --> 01:25:52.937
Sir, all the guidance chips
are gone.

01:25:53.013 --> 01:25:55.087
Captain, I guess you didn't
quite take care of the rat problem.

01:25:55.163 --> 01:25:57.083
- No, sir.
- Well, there are two dead men here...

01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:00.537
- who strongly suggest
you go finish the job.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:00.614 --> 01:26:03.568
Yes, sir!
Rio, Royce, let's go!

01:26:03.645 --> 01:26:05.564
Move out!

01:26:10.322 --> 01:26:13.470
-You really don't know where this goes?
-No, I don't know where it goes.

01:26:13.546 --> 01:26:15.733
Well, it's starting to pick up speed.
Do you know how to slow it down?

01:26:15.810 --> 01:26:17.729
No, I don't.

01:26:44.748 --> 01:26:46.859
God.

01:26:54.650 --> 01:26:57.298
Mason, you all right?

01:26:57.374 --> 01:26:59.945
Yes, perfectly okay,
you fucking idiot!

01:27:02.325 --> 01:27:04.705
- They're coming.
- Who?

01:27:04.782 --> 01:27:07.545
- The marines!
- Where?

01:28:07.031 --> 01:28:10.217
- What the fuck's goin' on?
- Let's cut him off.

01:28:15.936 --> 01:28:18.814
No! No! No!

01:28:32.745 --> 01:28:34.740
Mason!

01:28:37.658 --> 01:28:39.500
Mason!

01:29:51.841 --> 01:29:56.984
You motherfucker!
Die! Die! Die!

01:30:16.327 --> 01:30:19.896
I'm rather glad
you didn't hesitate too long.

01:30:23.352 --> 01:30:26.613
How do you do it?

01:30:28.185 --> 01:30:32.139
Oh, I was trained by the best.
British lntelligence.

01:30:34.250 --> 01:30:36.054
Come on.

01:30:36.092 --> 01:30:40.313
But in retrospect, I'd rather
have been a poet or a farmer.

01:30:40.352 --> 01:30:42.040
Okay.

01:30:45.994 --> 01:30:49.101
Okay, the president arrives
in three hours.

01:30:49.217 --> 01:30:53.822
His directive is to string Hummel along
until the air strike is operational.

01:30:53.898 --> 01:30:57.047
- What's the word from Mohave, General?
- The same as last time, Lou.

01:30:57.124 --> 01:30:59.694
They're going as fast as they can.

01:31:04.337 --> 01:31:08.253
- Do it over here.
- On your knees. On your knees!

01:31:17.847 --> 01:31:20.956
Navy SEALs, listen up. You've got
something that belongs to me.

01:31:21.034 --> 01:31:23.413
Twelve guidance chips,
to be precise.

01:31:23.490 --> 01:31:27.980
Let me remind you there are
lives at stake, civilian lives.

01:31:28.056 --> 01:31:29.975
Speak up.

01:31:30.051 --> 01:31:33.891
- Speak up!
- I, uh, uh--

01:31:33.967 --> 01:31:36.729
- Tell them your name.
- My name is Larry Henderson.

01:31:36.768 --> 01:31:40.759
- Oh, man.
- And I'm a father of three.

01:31:40.836 --> 01:31:44.023
And, uh, they've got a gun
to my head.

01:31:44.099 --> 01:31:47.744
You've got exactly three minutes
to return the guidance chips
to the exercise yard...

01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:50.430
- or Mr. Henderson won't have a head.
- Oh, no.

01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:54.115
Hey. Wha--

01:31:54.154 --> 01:31:56.418
Now, three to go.

01:31:56.457 --> 01:31:59.450
You find them
and defuse them, okay?

01:32:00.563 --> 01:32:02.099
- All right.
- All right.

01:32:02.175 --> 01:32:05.669
I'll try and delay Hummel
and give you more time.

01:32:05.745 --> 01:32:08.814
Hey, what about
Mr. Henderson's head?

01:32:11.348 --> 01:32:14.187
Okay? What do you mean?

01:32:19.599 --> 01:32:21.518
Okay.

01:32:32.954 --> 01:32:36.370
- General.
- Who the hell are you?

01:32:38.173 --> 01:32:40.438
I'm all that's left
of the enemy.

01:32:54.101 --> 01:32:55.482
Bingo.

01:33:04.193 --> 01:33:06.189
Stand easy.

01:33:09.566 --> 01:33:12.598
Thought I'd been in the service
a long time.

01:33:12.675 --> 01:33:16.782
- Name and rank, sailor.
- Well, it's army, actually.

01:33:16.859 --> 01:33:22.040
Answer the question.
And address him as "General, sir."

01:33:22.116 --> 01:33:25.109
Captain John Patrick Mason,
General, sir...

01:33:25.186 --> 01:33:28.948
of Her Majesty's S.A.S.
Retired, of course.

01:33:32.709 --> 01:33:36.161
You're a long way
from home, Captain.

01:33:36.239 --> 01:33:37.775
How the hell are you
involved in this?

01:33:37.851 --> 01:33:40.231
Oh, I have a unique knowledge
of this prison facility.

01:33:40.307 --> 01:33:43.570
I was, uh, formerly a guest here.

01:33:57.347 --> 01:33:59.380
Hi, sweetie.

01:34:06.366 --> 01:34:08.324
Hey, come back here, little boy.

01:34:10.051 --> 01:34:12.545
Did they bother to tell you
who I am, why I'm doing this?

01:34:12.623 --> 01:34:14.849
Or are they just using you
like they do everybody else?

01:34:14.926 --> 01:34:18.647
All I know is you were big in Vietnam.
I saw the highlights on television.

01:34:18.724 --> 01:34:21.794
Then you wouldn't have any
fuckin' idea what it means
to lead some of the finest men...

01:34:21.832 --> 01:34:25.096
on God's earth into battle,
and then see their memory betrayed
by their own fuckin' government.

01:34:25.172 --> 01:34:28.242
I don't quite see how you cherish
the memory of the dead...

01:34:28.318 --> 01:34:30.967
by killing another million.

01:34:31.044 --> 01:34:34.075
And, uh, this is not combat.

01:34:34.151 --> 01:34:38.259
It's an act of lunacy, General, sir.

01:34:38.335 --> 01:34:40.944
Personally, I think
you're a fuckin' idiot.

01:34:46.816 --> 01:34:49.043
"The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time...

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:52.574
with the blood of patriots
and tyrants." Thomas Jefferson.

01:34:52.650 --> 01:34:57.449
"Patriotism is the virtue of
the vicious," according to Oscar Wilde.

01:35:02.745 --> 01:35:06.736
- Thank you for making my point.
- Where are the guidance chips?

01:35:06.812 --> 01:35:09.422
Where are the guidance chips?

01:35:09.499 --> 01:35:13.491
- I destroyed them.
- That was a bad move, soldier.

01:35:13.567 --> 01:35:15.486
Does that mean
you'll execute us both?

01:35:43.347 --> 01:35:45.843
You're lucky that old man Hummel
wants you alive.

01:35:45.921 --> 01:35:47.877
'Cause I'll take pleasure
in guttin' you, boy.

01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:58.124
I'd take pleasure
in guttin' you

01:35:58.163 --> 01:35:59.697
Boy

01:35:59.774 --> 01:36:03.344
"l'll take pleasure
in guttin' you, boy."

01:36:04.648 --> 01:36:06.452
What is wrong
with these people, huh, Mason?

01:36:06.490 --> 01:36:10.483
Don't you think there's
a lot of, uh, a lot of anger
floatin' around this island?

01:36:10.559 --> 01:36:13.668
Kind of a pubescent volatility?
Don't you think?

01:36:13.744 --> 01:36:17.851
A lot of angst, a lot of, "l'm 16,
I'm angry at my father" syndrome?

01:36:17.927 --> 01:36:19.886
I mean, grow up!
We're stuck on an island...

01:36:19.962 --> 01:36:23.070
with a bunch of
violence-for-pleasure-seeking
psychopathic marines.

01:36:23.147 --> 01:36:25.718
Shame on them!

01:36:27.982 --> 01:36:31.476
Anyway, I only got one chem round.
There's two left.

01:36:31.552 --> 01:36:35.313
- Mason?
- Yes, I'm here.

01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:37.846
I was just thinking
how wonderful it was...

01:36:37.922 --> 01:36:40.225
when the inmates weren't allowed
to talk in here.

01:36:40.264 --> 01:36:42.912
Not allowed to talk.

01:36:42.989 --> 01:36:45.062
How'd you do it?

01:36:45.099 --> 01:36:50.511
Uh, nurtured the hope
that there was hope.

01:36:50.587 --> 01:36:53.158
That one day I'd breathe free air.

01:36:53.196 --> 01:36:56.460
Perhaps meet my daughter.

01:36:56.498 --> 01:37:01.218
Modest hopes, but, uh,
they kept a man alive.

01:37:01.294 --> 01:37:04.325
What'd they put you
away for, John?

01:37:04.403 --> 01:37:07.282
Oh, that's a long story.

01:37:07.358 --> 01:37:10.159
Well, I'm not goin' anywhere.

01:37:10.237 --> 01:37:13.230
When was the last communication
from our men on Alcatraz?

01:37:13.269 --> 01:37:14.918
Seven hours.

01:37:17.336 --> 01:37:19.562
Thermite plasma is operational.

01:37:19.639 --> 01:37:22.709
- Get me the president.
- Be seated.

01:37:22.787 --> 01:37:26.776
Gentlemen, consider yourselves
on ground alert. If we receive
launch authority...

01:37:26.854 --> 01:37:30.424
your mission is the complete thermal
destruction of Alcatraz lsland.

01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:33.839
The entire island is to be blanketed,
not one square inch missed.

01:37:33.916 --> 01:37:36.601
Eighty-one American civilians
and a number of U.S. Marines...

01:37:36.679 --> 01:37:38.943
will lose their lives
in this air strike.

01:37:40.708 --> 01:37:43.203
Why didn't you just tell them
where the microfilm was...

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:46.082
and, and create a solution?

01:37:46.119 --> 01:37:50.609
Hmph. The moment they had
the microfilm, they'd suicide me.

01:37:50.687 --> 01:37:54.525
- Some solution.
- And you ended up here.

01:37:54.602 --> 01:37:58.669
Which brings me to another question.
When you broke out--

01:37:58.745 --> 01:38:03.121
Let me see if I can get this straight.
You went down the incinerator chute...

01:38:03.197 --> 01:38:07.459
on the mine cars, through
the tunnels to the power plant...

01:38:07.535 --> 01:38:11.258
under the steam engine--
That was really cool, by the way--

01:38:11.335 --> 01:38:13.791
and into the cistern
through the intake pipe.

01:38:13.867 --> 01:38:19.164
But how, in the name
of Zeus's butthole...

01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:21.965
did you get out
of your cell?

01:38:22.004 --> 01:38:24.690
I only ask because
in our current situation...

01:38:24.766 --> 01:38:29.834
well, it could prove
to be useful information, maybe!

01:38:47.295 --> 01:38:50.290
Trade secrets, my son.

01:38:51.325 --> 01:38:52.668
Wow.

01:38:52.783 --> 01:38:55.125
General,
two operational rockets left.

01:38:55.202 --> 01:38:56.851
One's at the lower lighthouse
and there is one on the roof.

01:38:56.929 --> 01:38:59.845
And both of the birds
are ready to fly, sir.

01:38:59.922 --> 01:39:03.108
- G-General, can you hear me?
- I heard you, Captain.

01:39:03.146 --> 01:39:05.640
Oh, just makin' sure.

01:39:05.718 --> 01:39:10.169
Should we prepare
for launch, General?

01:39:10.246 --> 01:39:12.241
I'll handle the strategy, Captain.

01:39:12.317 --> 01:39:15.772
Yes, sir.

01:39:15.850 --> 01:39:19.571
The hour is approaching, sir.
Just letting the General know
of the time, sir.

01:39:19.648 --> 01:39:23.371
- I'm very aware of the time, Captain.
- Aye, aye, sir. Lettin' you know.

01:39:23.447 --> 01:39:26.019
Me and my boys are ready to
cock, lock, and ready to rock.

01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:30.202
Mason, where're you going?

01:39:30.279 --> 01:39:32.696
Thirty years ago I vowed
I wouldn't die in this toilet.

01:39:32.774 --> 01:39:37.994
You're not leaving! There's a madman in
there with his hand on a, on a button!

01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:41.140
Shh. Some sniper's
gonna get his ass.

01:39:42.292 --> 01:39:45.208
Stop moving, Mason.

01:39:45.284 --> 01:39:47.702
Mason, stop moving.

01:39:47.779 --> 01:39:51.348
Hummel won't do it.
He's a soldier, not a murderer.

01:39:51.386 --> 01:39:54.802
- I read it in his eyes.
- You read his eyes?

01:39:54.879 --> 01:39:57.142
Oh, well, then,
everything's just fine!

01:39:57.181 --> 01:39:59.907
- I can't afford to take that chance.
- Why don't you talk louder?

01:40:01.019 --> 01:40:04.090
Three minutes to go, sir.

01:40:04.129 --> 01:40:07.199
- They're not gonna call, Frank.
- Oh, they'll call.

01:40:07.275 --> 01:40:10.231
They'll call if we fire
one of our rockets up their ass.

01:40:10.307 --> 01:40:13.186
Sir.

01:40:17.907 --> 01:40:20.517
- Hummel.
- Hi, Frank. It's AI Kramer here.

01:40:20.554 --> 01:40:23.164
- How's it going out there?
- How do you think it's goin'?

01:40:23.242 --> 01:40:26.274
- Listen, on this end we're gonna
need another hour, Frank.
- You've got three minutes.

01:40:26.312 --> 01:40:29.190
Listen, uh, Frank, we have to get final
authorization from the president.

01:40:29.227 --> 01:40:31.301
You've got three minutes.

01:40:31.339 --> 01:40:33.602
Frank, please don't do
anything stupid.

01:40:36.099 --> 01:40:37.979
They want another hour.

01:40:38.055 --> 01:40:41.279
Well, that's bullshit.
That's bullshit, General. They're lyin'!

01:40:41.355 --> 01:40:43.351
They're calling our bluff, sir.

01:40:43.427 --> 01:40:47.151
They're playing you
for a fool, sir.

01:40:47.189 --> 01:40:50.335
Order the launch, General.

01:40:50.413 --> 01:40:53.867
Come on, General.
Let's be all we can be.

01:41:07.644 --> 01:41:09.679
The mission's not complete!

01:41:09.755 --> 01:41:11.597
Well, mine is.

01:41:11.674 --> 01:41:14.360
When this is over,
you'll go back home...

01:41:14.438 --> 01:41:19.272
driving Carla and your baby insane
in your beige Volvo.

01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:22.842
And I'll be dead or back in prison,
which is the same thing.

01:41:22.919 --> 01:41:24.953
You're not leaving.

01:41:29.211 --> 01:41:33.127
All right, I'll do it myself.

01:41:34.547 --> 01:41:36.581
I got three weeks'
weapons training.

01:41:36.658 --> 01:41:40.458
I'll kick the-- Out of
a platoon full of marines.

01:41:40.495 --> 01:41:43.220
No problem.

01:41:54.541 --> 01:41:57.344
- Major, patch me into Roof Battery.
- Aye, sir.

01:41:57.420 --> 01:42:00.758
Fire open control circuit
coordinates to the roof, sir.

01:42:01.449 --> 01:42:03.139
Let's go!

01:42:08.245 --> 01:42:10.432
Laser powered up!

01:42:10.509 --> 01:42:15.575
- Oh, no.
- I said, on your knees!

01:42:15.613 --> 01:42:20.104
My name's Stanley Goodspeed. I'm a
chemical weapons specialist for the FBl.

01:42:20.181 --> 01:42:22.099
- Uh, glass or plastic?
- What?

01:42:22.137 --> 01:42:24.671
- Glass or plastic? Glass or plastic?
- Shut the fuck up!

01:42:24.747 --> 01:42:27.356
Because if the winds change
after you launch those rockets...

01:42:27.433 --> 01:42:29.390
- we're all gonna die.
- Shut up!

01:42:29.468 --> 01:42:33.344
And you're gonna end up in either
a glass jar or a plastic bag.

01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:36.644
So, what do you say you do the math,
h-hand over the gun...

01:42:36.721 --> 01:42:40.022
- and let's go find some rockets?
- I said shut the fuck--

01:42:48.388 --> 01:42:51.074
- You made the right choice.
- I decided I didn't want your child...

01:42:51.112 --> 01:42:53.837
growing up without a father.

01:42:53.915 --> 01:42:56.678
Hey, the last time I swam
this channel I was your age.

01:42:56.754 --> 01:42:59.709
So, I'm fucked either way.
So, come on.

01:42:59.785 --> 01:43:02.549
Weapon is hot. I am standing by
for the launch command.

01:43:02.625 --> 01:43:05.274
Man, killing Navy SEALs
is one thing--

01:43:05.351 --> 01:43:08.652
- Is this for real?
- Hey, it's business.

01:43:11.298 --> 01:43:13.679
Access code entered.
Weapon available for release.

01:43:13.717 --> 01:43:16.596
Launch coordinates: six, seven,

01:43:16.634 --> 01:43:19.704
five, four, five, niner.

01:43:22.044 --> 01:43:25.998
The weapon is hot.
I'm standing by for launch command.

01:43:26.074 --> 01:43:28.033
That's affirmative.

01:43:34.441 --> 01:43:36.820
Standing by for command.

01:43:44.458 --> 01:43:46.952
I'm waiting for
launch command, General.

01:43:55.242 --> 01:43:57.506
- Fire.
- Fire!

01:44:02.265 --> 01:44:04.453
Missile loose!
Missile loose!

01:44:09.749 --> 01:44:14.164
Origin:
Alcatraz, 67253725.

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:18.154
- What's the goddamn heading?
- Heading 185 degrees south southeast.

01:44:18.193 --> 01:44:22.337
- Speed?
- Three hundred knots.
It's headed right at Oakland.

01:44:22.415 --> 01:44:24.754
Football game.

01:44:27.021 --> 01:44:28.786
Oh, my God.

01:44:50.775 --> 01:44:53.731
Missile radically
changing direction.

01:44:58.603 --> 01:45:02.865
New direction: 275 degrees west.
It's headed out to sea, sir.

01:45:04.208 --> 01:45:06.433
Oh, Christ!

01:45:06.511 --> 01:45:08.813
Missile losing altitude. Falling.

01:45:10.348 --> 01:45:13.648
Falling, 300 feet, 200, 100.

01:45:16.719 --> 01:45:19.520
Bogey detonated
under water.

01:45:22.590 --> 01:45:23.780
What the fuck?

01:45:23.895 --> 01:45:26.161
It missed.

01:45:26.237 --> 01:45:28.309
- Well, that's great.
- Extremely great.

01:45:28.385 --> 01:45:30.572
But there's still one left.

01:45:30.650 --> 01:45:34.219
What happened to the rocket? What
the fuck happened to the coordinates?

01:45:34.257 --> 01:45:37.673
What the fuck is going on?
Sir! Major!

01:45:37.751 --> 01:45:40.629
- Captain, step outside.
- Talk to me, sir.

01:45:40.705 --> 01:45:42.625
Captain, step outside!

01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:57.707
Get me the Pentagon.

01:46:11.179 --> 01:46:14.019
What the hell was that, Frank?

01:46:14.057 --> 01:46:17.089
- I said, what the hell--
- I heard what you said!
lf you're gonna be insubordinate...

01:46:17.166 --> 01:46:20.581
- I'd appreciate it if you'd do
it with a little more respect.
- Cut the crap, General.

01:46:20.658 --> 01:46:22.500
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not ready to kill these people.

01:46:22.578 --> 01:46:24.573
- Call the Pentagon. Ask for more time.
- No!

01:46:24.649 --> 01:46:27.605
Do it, Frank!
We're coming loose.

01:46:27.681 --> 01:46:30.675
You're coming loose.
The rest of us are in complete control.

01:46:30.751 --> 01:46:33.591
- We're askin' 'em.
We're askin' 'em for a new deadline.
- Put the phone down.

01:46:33.669 --> 01:46:35.471
- The men are falling apart.
- The men are marines!

01:46:35.549 --> 01:46:39.041
Are they?

01:46:39.117 --> 01:46:41.651
- I wanna talk to General Kramer.
- You've been asked by an old friend.

01:46:41.727 --> 01:46:44.183
- Put him on the phone right now.
- You've been ordered
by a superior officer.

01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:47.140
-This is Major Baxter.
-Now you're being given your
last chance by a man with a gun.

01:46:47.216 --> 01:46:49.557
Put the phone down.

01:46:53.203 --> 01:46:55.812
- I thought you weren't ready to kill.
- I'm warmin' up.

01:46:57.272 --> 01:46:59.152
At ease.

01:47:07.324 --> 01:47:09.821
They need a decision,
Mr. President.

01:47:18.493 --> 01:47:20.950
These past few hours...

01:47:21.026 --> 01:47:24.711
have been the longest,
darkest of my life.

01:47:24.787 --> 01:47:28.778
How does one weigh human life?

01:47:28.854 --> 01:47:32.233
One million civilians
against 81 hostages.

01:47:33.423 --> 01:47:35.802
And in the middle, Frank Hummel.

01:47:37.145 --> 01:47:41.520
That we have ignored,
abandoned or marginalized...

01:47:41.596 --> 01:47:43.977
a great soldier like Frank Hummel...

01:47:44.014 --> 01:47:48.773
and that American boys have paid
for that neglect in blood...

01:47:48.811 --> 01:47:52.879
is equally real
and equally tragic.

01:47:55.643 --> 01:47:58.598
We are at war with terror.

01:47:58.675 --> 01:48:00.901
Fighting a war means casualties.

01:48:00.977 --> 01:48:04.277
This is the worst call
I've ever had to make.

01:48:08.346 --> 01:48:10.764
Air strike approved.

01:48:13.759 --> 01:48:15.676
Red Thunder to tower.
Request clearance.

01:48:17.134 --> 01:48:19.285
With the amount of firepower
they're gonna drop in there...

01:48:19.323 --> 01:48:22.585
- Tower this is Strike Leader.
Prepared to go.
- it'll be over in a few seconds.

01:48:22.623 --> 01:48:24.926
Flight time to drop point: 17 minutes.

01:48:31.106 --> 01:48:35.711
Excuse me, General, sir,
with all due respect to you,
but what the fuck is going on?

01:48:35.787 --> 01:48:38.895
- You changed the coordinates,
didn't you, General?
- That's affirmative, Captain.

01:48:38.971 --> 01:48:42.811
So, now they think we're
gutless, the Feds? They think
we won't actually do it.

01:48:42.887 --> 01:48:45.689
They're gonna come at us with everything
they've got. Air and sea.

01:48:45.765 --> 01:48:49.794
- They're gonna bomb our ass
back to the Stone Age.
- They don't know we missed on purpose.

01:48:49.832 --> 01:48:55.361
Great. We're not gutless,
we're incompetent. That right?

01:48:55.437 --> 01:48:59.121
I don't think I like your tone, Captain.
We planned for this contingency.

01:48:59.197 --> 01:49:01.653
Load the V.X. into the choppers,
take four hostages and evacuate.

01:49:01.731 --> 01:49:03.612
The consequences of our actions
I'll face alone.

01:49:03.688 --> 01:49:07.066
Excuse me, General,
but what about the fucking money?

01:49:07.142 --> 01:49:09.521
There is no fucking money.
Mission's over.

01:49:09.597 --> 01:49:11.324
Bullshit it's over.

01:49:11.402 --> 01:49:14.856
You're talking to a General, soldier.
Maintain discipline.

01:49:14.933 --> 01:49:16.891
I'm not a soldier, Major.

01:49:16.968 --> 01:49:21.495
The day we took hostages we became
mercenaries. And mercenaries get paid!

01:49:21.573 --> 01:49:24.105
I want my fucking money!

01:49:24.183 --> 01:49:27.791
This mission was based
on the threat of force.

01:49:27.867 --> 01:49:31.742
I'm not about to kill 80,000
innocent people. Do you think
I'm out of my fucking mind?

01:49:34.199 --> 01:49:36.617
We bluffed. They called it.
The mission's over.

01:49:40.877 --> 01:49:43.371
Whoever said anything
about bluffing, General?

01:49:43.447 --> 01:49:45.291
Stand down, Captain.

01:49:49.703 --> 01:49:51.930
Stand down, Captain!

01:49:57.647 --> 01:50:00.450
Major, I'm ordering you to take
these men to the choppers and evacuate.

01:50:03.289 --> 01:50:07.243
- That's a simple order, Major!
- It's not so simple, Frank.

01:50:07.319 --> 01:50:09.698
Sergeant Crisp...

01:50:09.737 --> 01:50:12.463
secure the General.

01:50:12.539 --> 01:50:14.804
I'm relieving you
of your command, sir.

01:50:19.140 --> 01:50:21.097
Sergeant!

01:50:27.776 --> 01:50:31.037
- I'll have that sidearm, sir.
- You mean this sidearm?

01:50:38.906 --> 01:50:42.244
Major Baxter, you're either
with us or against us.

01:50:47.655 --> 01:50:50.611
It has been the greatest honor
of my life to serve with you, General.

01:50:55.484 --> 01:50:58.170
But like he said...

01:50:59.438 --> 01:51:01.970
it's over.

01:51:17.245 --> 01:51:19.316
Let's get him.

01:51:24.153 --> 01:51:26.724
Mason!

01:51:29.257 --> 01:51:33.055
- My God, what have I done?
- Where's the last rocket?
Where's the last rocket?

01:51:35.972 --> 01:51:38.812
- Where's the last rocket?
- Lower lighthouse.

01:51:38.890 --> 01:51:41.499
- Lower lighthouse.
- Go!

01:51:54.163 --> 01:51:56.965
Darrow, go to the lighthouse.
I'll take care of this fucker!

01:52:02.990 --> 01:52:07.097
One, two, three! Eat that!

01:52:20.838 --> 01:52:22.296
Did it.

01:52:52.078 --> 01:52:56.376
Come here. Come here,
you little chicken shit!

01:52:56.453 --> 01:52:59.600
You shoot me, I drop this.
We're both dead.

01:52:59.676 --> 01:53:01.863
Well, come on. Come on.
Don't be scared. I won't hurt ya.

01:53:01.941 --> 01:53:04.013
- Come on.
- Do you know how this shit works?

01:53:04.090 --> 01:53:06.200
You know how this shit works?

01:53:10.039 --> 01:53:12.072
Come on. Come on.

01:53:12.149 --> 01:53:14.145
I don't need the gun.
I'll put it down.

01:53:14.222 --> 01:53:18.405
Come on. Let's play.
Come on. Come on.

01:53:18.481 --> 01:53:22.971
Listen, I think we got
started off on the wrong foot.
Stan Goodspeed, FBl. Uh--

01:53:23.049 --> 01:53:26.157
Let's talk music. Do you like
the Elton John song, "Rocket Man"?

01:53:26.234 --> 01:53:28.229
I don't like soft-ass shit.

01:53:28.305 --> 01:53:30.380
Oh, you-- Oh, oh. Oh.

01:53:30.456 --> 01:53:34.293
Well, I only bring it up
because, uh, it's you.

01:53:34.369 --> 01:53:36.826
You're the Rocket Man.

01:53:38.399 --> 01:53:40.165
No!

01:53:42.085 --> 01:53:46.114
- How do you like how that shit works?
- Second rocket's away!

01:53:53.636 --> 01:53:55.631
It splashed into the bay, sir.
No detonation.

01:53:56.898 --> 01:53:59.238
Shit!

01:54:18.391 --> 01:54:20.463
Darrow!

01:54:20.540 --> 01:54:22.534
Open up!

01:54:25.183 --> 01:54:26.832
Come on.

01:54:26.910 --> 01:54:28.561
Open up!

01:54:56.116 --> 01:54:58.840
Hey, you mother!

01:55:31.001 --> 01:55:33.458
Oh, I'm gonna get you now, baby.

01:55:36.873 --> 01:55:39.407
Okay.

01:55:41.402 --> 01:55:43.013
I got ya. I got you, baby.

01:55:44.319 --> 01:55:46.467
Come on.

01:56:01.895 --> 01:56:03.200
Fucker!

01:56:28.723 --> 01:56:30.719
Red Thunder Strike Leader.

01:56:30.795 --> 01:56:33.098
Time on target: seven minutes.

01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:52.478
English prick.
I tell you my old man was lrish?

01:56:55.242 --> 01:56:57.891
Maintain air speed 450 knots.

01:57:03.839 --> 01:57:05.911
Fuck!

01:57:23.526 --> 01:57:25.522
It's me and you, pal.

01:57:25.598 --> 01:57:27.979
I want that fucking chip!

01:57:37.765 --> 01:57:39.760
I love pressure.

01:57:46.668 --> 01:57:49.547
I know you're in here,
and I know you can hear me.

01:57:49.624 --> 01:57:51.964
Now, pay the piper
and come out like a man.

01:58:20.289 --> 01:58:22.630
Increase speed
to 500 knots.

01:58:22.706 --> 01:58:25.355
You motherfucker! Die!

01:58:29.882 --> 01:58:33.721
I'm gonna choke my million bucks
out of you. You're gonna die.

01:58:33.797 --> 01:58:36.560
Eat that, you fuck!

01:59:03.770 --> 01:59:06.150
All right, team, inbound.
Time on target: 60 seconds.

01:59:10.985 --> 01:59:14.861
Come to course heading
142 degrees.

01:59:22.230 --> 01:59:24.302
When he neutralizes the threat...

01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:27.411
we launch green flares
and we wait for the cavalry.

01:59:31.902 --> 01:59:35.471
- Let's tighten up that formation.
- May God have mercy on your souls.

01:59:35.547 --> 01:59:38.616
Please don't let this happen. There has
to be something you can do. Please.

01:59:48.826 --> 01:59:51.743
Let's drop to the deck.
One hundred feet below radar.

02:00:01.452 --> 02:00:03.756
Target acquired.
Rolling in.

02:00:07.019 --> 02:00:10.816
This is Red Thunder.
Master armed. Master armed.

02:00:12.045 --> 02:00:14.501
Time on target: 12 seconds.

02:00:16.881 --> 02:00:19.914
T.O.T.: ten seconds.

02:00:23.828 --> 02:00:25.670
Stay tight, gentlemen.

02:00:28.356 --> 02:00:30.199
I got green smoke.
I got green smoke!

02:00:30.276 --> 02:00:33.461
This is C.Q. One, C.Q. One!
Green smoke! We have green smoke! Over.

02:00:33.537 --> 02:00:35.687
- Eh, gimme that! Gimme that! Abort!
- Abort!

02:00:35.764 --> 02:00:38.412
- Flight leader, abort, abort, abort!
- Jesus Chri--

02:00:40.523 --> 02:00:43.093
I already dropped them!

02:00:51.730 --> 02:00:55.606
- Oh, goddamn it!
- Oh, my God!

02:00:58.176 --> 02:01:01.055
Get out of my way. Let me through,
please. Let me through!

02:01:05.276 --> 02:01:09.076
The cells did not get hit. The bombs
hit on the back of the island.

02:01:30.989 --> 02:01:35.941
I'm fed up saving your ass.
I'm amazed you ever got past puberty.

02:01:36.017 --> 02:01:39.855
I suppose all this will make
a great bedtime story to tell your kid.

02:01:39.931 --> 02:01:45.112
You're insane, Mason.
The kid'll have nightmares.
Spend all my money on shrinks.

02:01:46.187 --> 02:01:48.144
Goodspeed, come in.

02:01:48.182 --> 02:01:51.253
Goodspeed, Goodspeed,
do you read me? Come in!

02:01:51.329 --> 02:01:54.707
- Scanning all radio frequencies.
- Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in!

02:01:56.817 --> 02:01:59.504
Goodspeed, do you read me?
Come in!

02:02:04.492 --> 02:02:08.024
Goodspeed, do you read me?
Come in!

02:02:08.100 --> 02:02:10.749
This is Goodspeed.

02:02:12.322 --> 02:02:16.544
- Are the hostages alive?
- Every one of 'em.

02:02:19.346 --> 02:02:21.919
Goodspeed, it's Womack.

02:02:21.995 --> 02:02:24.643
What about Mason?

02:02:31.473 --> 02:02:33.738
- He's dead, sir.
- How? When?

02:02:33.815 --> 02:02:36.386
Just come and get me.

02:02:38.765 --> 02:02:41.835
Womack tore up your pardon, John.

02:02:41.874 --> 02:02:44.521
But, of course.
I knew he would.

02:02:44.599 --> 02:02:47.631
The S.D.U.s and the scuba gear
should still be where we came ashore.

02:02:47.707 --> 02:02:52.274
If you can get to the
Pan Pacific Hotel, there's clothes
in my closet, $200 in the Bible.

02:02:52.350 --> 02:02:54.807
Room 26.

02:02:54.884 --> 02:02:59.183
Well, it's been a long time
since I've said thank you to anybody.

02:03:00.987 --> 02:03:04.133
But thank you.

02:03:04.210 --> 02:03:09.852
Well, Stanley, uh, this is when
we go our separate ways, huh?

02:03:09.890 --> 02:03:14.265
But, uh, I'm sure you know
the etymology of your name "Goodspeed."

02:03:14.341 --> 02:03:18.370
Yeah, Godspeed: to wish someone
a prosperous journey. Why?

02:03:18.448 --> 02:03:22.056
Well, if you fancy a journey...

02:03:22.132 --> 02:03:25.126
I recommend Fort Walton, Kansas.

02:03:25.893 --> 02:03:28.042
I was thinking of Maui.

02:03:28.119 --> 02:03:30.267
No.

02:03:33.684 --> 02:03:36.564
Forget Maui.

02:03:41.705 --> 02:03:45.735
"St. Michael's Church,
Fort Walton, Kansas.

02:03:45.774 --> 02:03:48.038
"Front pew, right leg.

02:03:48.077 --> 02:03:50.840
Hollow."

02:03:50.916 --> 02:03:53.526
Is this what I think it is?

02:03:55.024 --> 02:03:57.941
Mason?

02:04:10.797 --> 02:04:13.866
-Congratulations, Dr. Goodspeed.
You did it.
-Thank you, sir.

02:04:13.942 --> 02:04:16.667
You know, for a while there,
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

02:04:16.745 --> 02:04:19.048
Well done, son.

02:04:19.124 --> 02:04:20.699
So, where's Mason?

02:04:20.776 --> 02:04:24.727
Vaporized. Blown out to sea.

02:04:24.806 --> 02:04:27.069
Blown out to sea, huh?

02:04:27.146 --> 02:04:29.525
Yeah.

02:04:30.294 --> 02:04:34.437
Poor bastard.

02:04:34.515 --> 02:04:39.312
Goodspeed, where's Mason? Where's his
body? I wanna see that son of a bitch!

02:04:39.388 --> 02:04:42.882
Vaporized, sir.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

02:04:42.958 --> 02:04:47.410
What? Vaporized?
A body can vaporize?

02:04:47.486 --> 02:04:50.517
Oh, yeah!
Absolutely, sir.

02:04:53.205 --> 02:04:57.158
St. Michael's Church,
front pew, right leg.

02:04:57.235 --> 02:04:59.115
Front pew, right leg.

02:04:59.153 --> 02:05:01.149
Vandals! Vandals!

02:05:01.225 --> 02:05:03.374
Oh, yes, baby, come on!

02:05:03.452 --> 02:05:07.135
- Stop! Vandals! Stop!
- I'm sorry!

02:05:07.213 --> 02:05:09.976
- Come on, baby!
- I've got it! Okay, let's go!

02:05:10.053 --> 02:05:13.199
- Stop! Stop!
- Sorry!

02:05:14.850 --> 02:05:16.424
Stop! Hey, hey, you!

02:05:18.342 --> 02:05:21.106
Vandals! Vandals!

02:05:21.182 --> 02:05:26.094
Honey, uh, you wanna know
who really killed J.F.K.?
