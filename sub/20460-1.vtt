We made it plain we don't want
no more traveling salesmen in Brighton.

02:56.593 --> 02:59.762
Credit is no good for a notions salesman.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.269

03:06.728 --> 03:09.272
- What's the matter with credit?
- It's old-fashioned.

03:09.481 --> 03:12.191
You're an anvil salesman.
Your firm give credit?

03:12.401 --> 03:16.279
- No, sir!
- Nor anybody else!

CONDUCTOR:
River City!

05:53.103 --> 05:55.062
Station stop, River City.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.523
Just crossed the state line into Iowa.

05:57.816 --> 06:00.484
Population River City: 2212.

06:00.694 --> 06:04.280
Cigarettes illegal in this state.

06:05.282 --> 06:08.784
If you're all through
I'll tell you about this Harold Hill.

06:08.994 --> 06:10.745
Say, you know Hill?

06:10.954 --> 06:15.124
Never saw him in my life. But I just
been run out of town because of Hill.

06:15.292 --> 06:18.210
He's giving every one of us a black eye.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.463
You go into town to call on the trade. . .

06:20.630 --> 06:23.466
. . .and they're waiting for you
with tar and feathers. . .

06:23.633 --> 06:25.885
. . .to ride you out the city limits on a rail!

06:26.094 --> 06:27.803
How you account for that?

06:27.971 --> 06:32.808
It's this Hill! He goes around
selling band instruments and uniforms.. .

06:33.018 --> 06:37.313
. . .and instruction books by guaranteeing
to teach the kids to play.

06:37.481 --> 06:40.775
- Stands to reason.
- And organize them kids into a band. . .

06:40.942 --> 06:42.485
. . .with himself as the leader.

06:42.652 --> 06:43.861
What's wrong with that?

06:44.071 --> 06:46.322
He don't know one note. . .

06:46.490 --> 06:48.324
- . . .from another!
- Heh-heh.

06:48.492 --> 06:49.617
That's what's wrong!

06:49.826 --> 06:53.204
He don't know a bass drum
from a pipe organ.

06:53.413 --> 06:57.166
He's a bare-faced, double-shuffle,
two-bit thimblerigger!

06:57.375 --> 06:59.835
And I'll catch up with him
one of these days.

07:00.003 --> 07:02.171
When I do I'll have
the law on him quick!

07:02.380 --> 07:05.716
Territory's tough enough
without him fouling up the nest.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.177
I'd like to be around
when you catch up with him.

07:08.386 --> 07:12.848
I'm not apt to catch up with him in Iowa.
Not on your kidney plaster!

07:13.058 --> 07:15.851
He's too smart to pull
that flimflam out here.

07:16.019 --> 07:18.729
Not on these neck-bowed Hawkeyes.

07:20.190 --> 07:24.485
Gentlemen, you intrigue me.
I think I'll have to give Iowa a try.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.530

- I didn't drop it.

07:47.509 --> 07:48.843

08:01.898 --> 08:02.940

08:46.985 --> 08:49.278

08:49.446 --> 08:52.364

Gregory!

12:26.162 --> 12:29.623
Shh. Hill's the name this trip.
Professor Harold Hill.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.834
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

12:32.001 --> 12:33.335
I didn't know I was, myself.

12:33.503 --> 12:37.506
I never thought I'd find a slicker
like you here in the sarsaparilla belt.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.508
This is where I work.

12:41.052 --> 12:44.054
- You mean you live in this town?
- Yeah. I like it too.

12:44.264 --> 12:47.891
It's not Brooklyn, New York.
Not the city of homes and churches but--

12:48.101 --> 12:50.853
Brooklyn?
Marce, this isn't even Dubuque.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.730
Hey. Are you hiding out or what?

12:53.940 --> 12:58.569
Just not as light on my feet as I used
to be when I was shilling for you.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.655
You're in a business that got
a lot of close shaves.

13:01.865 --> 13:04.783
I got a nice job now.
I got a nice girl.

13:04.993 --> 13:07.536
Ethel Toffelmier.
That's the boss's niece.

13:08.246 --> 13:10.539
So you've gone legitimate, huh?

13:10.707 --> 13:12.833
I knew you'd come to no good.

13:13.042 --> 13:16.712
What are you selling now?
I heard you were in steam automobiles.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.088
- I was.
- What happened?

13:18.298 --> 13:21.049
- Somebody actually invented one.
- No!

13:21.217 --> 13:23.218
So now I'm back at the old stand.

13:23.386 --> 13:25.512
Not boys' bands?

13:25.847 --> 13:28.348
They got no call for boys' bands
in this town.

13:28.558 --> 13:31.310
Anything Iowa folk don't have
they do without.

13:31.519 --> 13:32.686
They got music?

13:32.896 --> 13:35.230
They got a gramophone down
to the barber shop.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.483
And a stuck-up librarian gives piano.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.193
- Gives piano?
- A maiden lady.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.904
She'll expose you
before you unpack this bag.

13:42.113 --> 13:46.200
Maiden lady librarians who give piano
are a specialty of mine.

13:46.409 --> 13:48.827
Just point her out
the minute you see her.

13:48.995 --> 13:52.080
Yeah. I'll back her into a corner
and breathe on her glasses.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.543
Thar she blows!

14:01.841 --> 14:03.675
I'll do it but I won't like it.

14:05.094 --> 14:08.764
That's not the librarian.
That's Mrs. Shinn, the mayor's wife.

14:20.944 --> 14:22.402
Good afternoon, Mrs. Shinn.

14:22.612 --> 14:25.030
Don't change the subject.

14:25.698 --> 14:26.782
Something the matter?

14:27.116 --> 14:31.245
The same thing is the matter as is
always the matter here. Look!

14:33.623 --> 14:36.375
Is this the sort of book
you give my daughter?

14:36.793 --> 14:41.129
This Ruby Hat of Omar Kay-ay-ay--
I am appalled!

14:41.965 --> 14:43.298
I did recommend it.

14:43.466 --> 14:45.300
It's beautiful Persian poetry.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.844
It's dirty Persian poetry.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.806
People lying out in the woods
eating sandwiches.

14:51.015 --> 14:54.268
Getting drunk
with pitfall and with gin.

14:54.519 --> 14:57.813
Drinking directly out of jugs
with innocent young girls.

14:57.981 --> 14:59.815
- No daughter of mine--
- Mrs. Shinn.

15:00.149 --> 15:02.317
The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam
is a classic.

15:04.821 --> 15:09.157
It's a smutty book, like most of
the others you keep here, I daresay.

15:09.367 --> 15:10.492
Honestly, Mrs. Shinn.

15:10.952 --> 15:15.122
Wouldn't you rather have your daughter
read a classic than Elinor Glyn?

15:15.665 --> 15:20.085
What Elinor Glyn reads
is her mother's problem.

15:20.295 --> 15:24.923
Just you keep your dirty books
away from my daughter.

15:44.819 --> 15:47.362
You sure picked yourself a town.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.823
Let me take you over to the hotel.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.700
Not sure I'm going to stay yet.

15:52.368 --> 15:55.996
First I got to find a way to get into
some of these Iowa boodlebags.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.040
Greg, it ain't easy.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.833
All I need is an opening.

16:00.043 --> 16:03.462
You remember the pitch. What can I use?
What's new around here?

16:03.838 --> 16:08.091
The other day a farmer brought in
an egg had 3 yolks in it.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.010
Was in the paper.

16:10.386 --> 16:13.388
That's exciting, all right.
No, what do you talk about?

16:13.598 --> 16:15.891
There's the weather, of course.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.726
When it's in season.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.312
Now, Marce, I need some ideas. . .

16:20.521 --> 16:23.940
. . .if I'm going to get your town
out of the serious trouble it's in.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.901
River City ain't in any trouble.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.653
We'll have to create some.

16:27.862 --> 16:31.573
Must create a desperate need
in your town for a boys' band.

16:33.368 --> 16:35.702
Why is everyone rubbering
into the billiard parlor?

16:36.412 --> 16:39.039
MARCELLUS:
They just got in a new pool table.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.916
HAROLD:
They must have seen one before.

16:41.084 --> 16:43.669
No. Just billiards.

16:47.799 --> 16:48.924
That'll do it!

16:49.092 --> 16:50.967
Just sit where you are.
And remember. . .

16:51.177 --> 16:53.261
. . .if you see that music teacher....

17:00.144 --> 17:01.645
Are you Mr. Dunlop?

17:01.813 --> 17:05.482
Either you're closing your eyes to a
situation you don't wish to acknowledge...

17:05.650 --> 17:08.276
. . .or you are not aware
of the caliber of disaster...

17:08.444 --> 17:12.280

Hello, Winthrop.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.565
Winthrop, it's after dark, dear!

25:25.774 --> 25:29.944
I'm having a party on Saturday.
Will you please come?

25:30.112 --> 25:34.490
It's going to be a very nice party.
And I'd especially like it if you'd--

25:34.700 --> 25:39.287
Amaryllis asked you to her party.
Are you going or aren't you?

25:39.496 --> 25:41.748
- No.
- No, what?

25:42.124 --> 25:43.166
No, thank you.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.293
You know the little girl's name.

25:45.502 --> 25:47.629
I'll bet he won't say it.

25:47.796 --> 25:50.548
"No, thank you," who, Winthrop?

25:51.091 --> 25:52.800
[SPEAKING WITH A LISP]
No, thank you, Amaryllith!

25:52.968 --> 25:54.010
"Amaryllith"!

25:57.514 --> 25:59.098
He's crying!

26:02.603 --> 26:04.062
Hello, Winthrop.

26:04.230 --> 26:07.523
Winthrop, you didn't even
say hello to your sister.

26:07.733 --> 26:11.027
He hates to say Amaryllis
because of the lisp.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.779
He's ashamed.

26:12.988 --> 26:14.948
We know all about his lisp, Amaryllis.

26:15.157 --> 26:18.910
Why should he get so mad at people?
Just because he lisps?

26:19.119 --> 26:22.455
- That's just part of it.
- What's the rest of it?

26:22.998 --> 26:26.501
Never mind, dear. It's just that
he never talks very much.

26:26.669 --> 26:28.836
Not even to you and your mother?

26:29.046 --> 26:33.216
No, but we have to be
very patient and understanding.

26:33.717 --> 26:35.260
I'm patient.

26:35.469 --> 26:39.097
I even say good night to him
on the evening star.

26:39.306 --> 26:40.682
Every night.

26:43.310 --> 26:45.687
Good night, my Winthrop.

26:45.854 --> 26:47.480
Good night.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.357
Sleep tight.

26:50.734 --> 26:53.361
And he never says anything to me.

26:53.779 --> 26:56.406
Oh, darling, don't cry.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.535
You'll have lots of time
for sweethearts.

27:00.744 --> 27:03.079
If not Winthrop,
there'll be someone else.

27:03.289 --> 27:07.292
Never! I'll end up an old maid like you.

27:07.501 --> 27:09.711
I'm sorry, Miss Marian.

27:10.004 --> 27:12.547

27:12.715 --> 27:15.091

27:15.301 --> 27:16.884
Yes, you may.

27:17.428 --> 27:19.345
If a girl doesn't have a sweetheart. . .

27:19.555 --> 27:23.224
. . .who's she going to say good night to
on the evening star?

27:23.976 --> 27:26.519
For the time being, you can just say:

27:26.729 --> 27:28.187
"Good night. . .

27:28.397 --> 27:29.397
. . .my someone."

27:29.606 --> 27:32.900
You can put the name in
when the right someone comes along.

27:33.068 --> 27:36.195
All right. It's better than nothing.

47:11.537 --> 47:13.038
What am I hearing?

47:13.247 --> 47:14.456
You, sir.

47:16.834 --> 47:18.710
Say "ice cream"

47:18.920 --> 47:22.088
- Ice cream. But I don't sing--
- Talk, then.

47:22.256 --> 47:23.423
HAROLD:
Down here

47:23.633 --> 47:25.550
Ice cream

47:26.427 --> 47:27.928
Ice cream.

47:28.095 --> 47:30.138
Talk slow

47:30.932 --> 47:32.974
Ice cream

47:33.434 --> 47:34.935
You see? Singing is just. . . .

47:35.102 --> 47:37.103
Sustained talking

47:37.271 --> 47:38.313
Now you, sir.

47:38.481 --> 47:39.523
Ice cream

47:39.690 --> 47:42.317
Now you, sir.
Now you, sir!

47:42.902 --> 47:47.948
Ice cream

47:50.076 --> 47:53.453
From now on you won't see one of
those men without the other three.

47:53.621 --> 47:55.038
Professor, you're wrong.

47:55.248 --> 47:58.750
Why, they've hated each other
for 15 years.

Professor Hill.

50:21.727 --> 50:23.937
Professor? Of what?

50:24.146 --> 50:26.981
What college gives a degree
for accosting women. . .

50:27.191 --> 50:29.275
. . .like a rowdy at a public dance hall?

50:29.527 --> 50:32.028
I wouldn't know.
I'm a Conservatory man.

50:32.238 --> 50:34.489
Gary, Indiana.
Gold Medal class of '05.

50:35.032 --> 50:37.951
Even should that happen
to be true, Mr. Hill...

50:38.119 --> 50:41.287
. . . I am not as easily mesmerized
as some people in town.

50:41.455 --> 50:44.708
It's only fair to tell you
I'm not impressed by your credentials. . .

50:44.917 --> 50:48.169
. . .which I've not seen,
nor your manners, which I have!

50:56.804 --> 50:58.722
HAROLD:
It's a golden key, as it were.

50:58.931 --> 51:01.599
Your key to the magic world of music.

51:01.809 --> 51:04.686
None of our family's ever been
what you'd call musical.

51:04.895 --> 51:07.564
Madam, that you do not know.

51:07.773 --> 51:12.819
Now the main thing is imagination
and proper instruction. Ah!

51:13.237 --> 51:15.655
You, young man, repeat after me.

51:20.244 --> 51:22.454

51:32.506 --> 51:35.425
Two members of the same family
with absolutely perfect pitch.

51:38.888 --> 51:40.680
Sign here, madam.

51:45.644 --> 51:48.730
MARCELLUS: You sure cut a swath down
at the high school yesterday.

51:48.898 --> 51:51.983
- Yeah.
- When you talked about them trombones. . .

51:52.151 --> 51:54.152
. . .you looked just like you used to
back in Joplin.

51:55.070 --> 51:56.279
HAROLD:
Joplin?

51:56.447 --> 52:00.867
Yeah, when you used to imitate that
Italian bandleader in the park.

52:01.035 --> 52:03.036
Oh, yeah.

52:04.497 --> 52:09.417
Ra ta ta ta ta ta
Ram ta ra ta ram

52:11.796 --> 52:13.671
That's kid stuff.

52:14.131 --> 52:16.216
I'm in rare form these days, son.

52:16.383 --> 52:19.302
Just keep your eye on me
for the next four weeks.

52:19.512 --> 52:22.847
Four weeks? You used to get
the instruments in 10 days.

52:23.474 --> 52:26.643
I still do, but it takes
four weeks for the uniforms.

52:26.894 --> 52:29.562
Uniforms? You've added uniforms?

52:29.730 --> 52:32.524
Uniforms and instruction books.

52:32.733 --> 52:35.193
Why warm up if
you're not going to pitch?

52:35.402 --> 52:39.739
You can't pass yourself off as
a music professor. You can't read music.

52:39.907 --> 52:43.034
I have a revolutionary new method,
the Think System.

52:43.202 --> 52:44.661
You don't bother with notes.

52:44.829 --> 52:45.912
My boy...

52:46.080 --> 52:50.041
. . .someday reading music is
going to be absolutely obsolete.

52:50.251 --> 52:53.962
I hope it's soon. In four weeks
these people will want to hear music.

52:54.171 --> 52:57.257
But when the uniforms arrive
they forget everything else.

52:57.466 --> 53:00.301
At least long enough for me
to collect and leave.

53:00.511 --> 53:02.679
This is a refined operation, son.

53:02.888 --> 53:06.015
I've got it timed down to
the wave of the brakeman's hand. . .

53:06.225 --> 53:08.726
. . .on the last train out of town.

53:21.574 --> 53:23.908
- Good evening, ladies.
- Good evening, ladies.

53:29.790 --> 53:31.291
HAROLD: Good evening, ladies.
WOMEN: Oh.

53:31.500 --> 53:32.625
Professor Hill.. .

53:32.835 --> 53:34.252
. . .we're all agog.

53:34.420 --> 53:37.297
Oh, yes, simply agog!

53:37.464 --> 53:40.216
- On the qui vive.
- Everyone's excited about the band.

53:40.426 --> 53:43.177
I'm Ethel Toffelmier,
the pianola girl.

53:43.387 --> 53:44.971
And this is Avis Grubb.

53:45.139 --> 53:46.890
- How do you do?
- And Mrs. Hicks.

53:47.057 --> 53:49.517
- Hello.
- And Mrs. Squires.

53:49.727 --> 53:53.146
And, of course, you've met
Eulalie Mackecknie Shinn.

53:53.314 --> 53:55.815
- Our mayor's wife.
- Yes, indeed.

53:55.983 --> 53:57.984
Oh, yes.

53:58.569 --> 54:01.446
Isn't it exciting, Eulalie?

54:02.197 --> 54:03.781
I couldn't say.

54:03.949 --> 54:05.825
Oh, no, I could not say.

54:05.993 --> 54:08.494
I could not say at this time.

54:08.662 --> 54:11.331
My husband will wish to investigate,
I'm sure.

54:11.916 --> 54:13.791
And naturally I'm reticent.

54:14.501 --> 54:16.794
Oh, yes. I'm reticent.

54:17.338 --> 54:19.756
Yes, of course.
I understand, Mrs. Shinn.

54:19.965 --> 54:23.301
But part of my music plans
include a committee on the dance.

54:23.510 --> 54:24.928
And I was thinking--

54:28.432 --> 54:29.974
Do that again, Mrs. Shinn.

54:30.517 --> 54:32.477
Do what? What did I do?

54:32.686 --> 54:34.604
Your foot, the way you just raised it.

54:34.855 --> 54:38.191
Oh, well, I have a bunion there
that bothers me.

54:38.359 --> 54:39.901
What grace!

54:40.694 --> 54:42.820
Oh, Mr. Hill.

54:42.988 --> 54:44.822
What natural flow of rhythm!

54:44.990 --> 54:46.449
Oh, Mr. Hill.

54:46.617 --> 54:48.952
What expression of line and movement!

54:51.038 --> 54:52.705
You must accept chairmanship. . .

54:52.915 --> 54:56.626
. . .of the ladies' auxiliary for the
classic dance. Mustn't she, ladies?

54:58.504 --> 55:02.715
Mrs. Shinn, your every move
bespeaks Delsarte.

55:03.258 --> 55:05.009
Will you? Will you?

55:05.219 --> 55:06.469
Say yes, Mrs. Shinn.

55:06.679 --> 55:07.845
Well, I--

55:08.055 --> 55:09.722
That is--

55:09.932 --> 55:12.558
Dancing? Well!

55:12.726 --> 55:13.768
Then you accept?

55:13.978 --> 55:15.478
Indeed! And I'd like to say--

55:15.688 --> 55:17.814
Thank you, Mrs. Shinn.

55:17.982 --> 55:19.148
Oh. . . .

55:24.154 --> 55:26.656
Now, the young lady
who teaches the piano.

55:28.325 --> 55:30.118
Marian Paroo, I believe.

55:30.285 --> 55:31.744

Oh!

55:33.956 --> 55:35.581
After all, she is the librarian.

55:35.749 --> 55:37.542
She must've picked him out
the first crack out of the box.

55:37.710 --> 55:38.751
Talking up to a man like that.

55:38.919 --> 55:41.754
He wouldn't talk about her if she
didn't try turkey-talking to him.

Ought to take her ticket
and punch it for her.

55:44.091 --> 55:45.550

- I think I got it.
- Yeah?

01:09:05.558 --> 01:09:07.392

to keep the music steady. . .

01:09:25.078 --> 01:09:26.662

01:09:58.027 --> 01:09:59.820
Mr. Mayor, I collect doorbells.

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:02.865

unusual tone quality--

01:10:03.074 --> 01:10:05.367
Flattery will not avail you.

01:10:05.577 --> 01:10:08.954

01:10:11.583 --> 01:10:15.085
- I must have just missed you.
- None of your alibis!

01:10:15.295 --> 01:10:17.629
- Your hand. Isn't that amazing?
- Hmm?

01:10:17.839 --> 01:10:18.964
What? What?

01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:22.134
That spread of the little finger.
It's hereditary.

01:10:22.343 --> 01:10:23.969
- It is? What does that mean?
- Mm.

01:10:24.304 --> 01:10:26.054
It means your son's little finger...

01:10:26.264 --> 01:10:29.474

01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:57.961

01:10:58.254 --> 01:11:00.172
- I never said you did.
- What do you know?

01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:03.258
I'd certainly know if I gave you a son.

01:11:03.468 --> 01:11:06.011
- I'm not talking to you.
- Who are you talking to?

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:07.471

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:11.934

you must realize. . .

01:11:22.487 --> 01:11:25.030
. . .that only one
out of every 78 adults.. .

01:11:25.198 --> 01:11:28.742
. . .has a ganglion that reaches
the ligature clear down to the apex.

01:11:28.952 --> 01:11:32.871
This automatically turns your
entire face into an amazing embouchure.

01:11:33.456 --> 01:11:35.624
I never had a sick day
in my life, doctor.

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:37.709
Ah. Professor.

01:11:37.919 --> 01:11:40.837
Professor! What shall I do for it?

01:11:41.172 --> 01:11:42.547
No, you don't understand.

01:11:42.757 --> 01:11:45.968
I'm trying to tell you,
you have the facial characteristics. . .

01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:48.220
. . .of a cornet virtuoso.

01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:50.764
If your boy has that same firm chin...

01:11:50.974 --> 01:11:53.225
. . .and those splendid cheek muscles,
oh-ho-ho. . ..

01:11:53.434 --> 01:11:55.018
By George!

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.688
Not that he'd ever really be great.

01:11:58.022 --> 01:11:59.481
Is that so?

01:11:59.691 --> 01:12:01.900
And in the name of
St. Bridget, why not?

01:12:02.193 --> 01:12:05.362
All of the really great
cornet players were Irish.

01:12:05.738 --> 01:12:07.990
O'Clark, O'Mendez, O'Klein.. . .

01:12:08.658 --> 01:12:10.367
But, professor, we are Irish.

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.077
No!

01:12:12.245 --> 01:12:13.912
No, really? That clinches it.

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:17.666
Sign here, Madam.
Your boy was born to play the cornet.

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:22.087
Fine, fine!
That'll be 7 dollars earnest money.

01:12:22.296 --> 01:12:25.924
Nothing more due until
the opening of band practice.

01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:30.095
Thank you. And I'll need your boy's
measurements for his uniform.

01:12:30.263 --> 01:12:31.680
MRS. PAROO:
His uniform?

01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:33.056
- Oh, yes--
- Ah!

01:12:33.266 --> 01:12:36.643
- Winthrop!
- Well, hello there, son.

01:12:37.311 --> 01:12:39.563
Why, certainly, his uniform.

01:12:39.772 --> 01:12:42.482
And there won't be
a penny due until delivery.

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:46.987
Which gives him four weeks to enjoy,
anticipate, imagine at no cost.

01:12:47.155 --> 01:12:48.947
Never allow the demands of tomorrow. . .

01:12:49.115 --> 01:12:52.492
. . .to interfere with the pleasures
and excitements of today.

01:12:52.744 --> 01:12:54.119
Would it have a--?

01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:56.371
- A. . . .
- A. . . .

01:12:58.458 --> 01:13:00.751
A stripe! Why, certainly, my boy!

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:04.629
A wide, red stripe down each side.
What do you think of that?

01:13:10.803 --> 01:13:13.680
You'll have to excuse Winthrop.

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:16.475
We can't get him to say
three words a day.

01:13:16.684 --> 01:13:18.185
Not even to us.

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:20.771
If you can get him to play
in that band. . .

01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:23.482
. . .you'll have St. Michael's
own way with you.

01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:26.651
But if anybody can do it,
I bet you can. Heh-heh.

01:13:26.819 --> 01:13:27.819
Thank you.

01:13:27.987 --> 01:13:31.782
You've a gift of the blarney about you,
no mistaking that.

01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:34.326
- Where are you from, my boy?
- Gary, Indiana.

01:13:34.494 --> 01:13:35.535
I knew it!

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:37.162
Where'd you say?

01:13:37.455 --> 01:13:40.791
Gary, Indiana.
Gary Conservatory was my alma mater.

01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:42.125
Was she now?

01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:45.629

01:15:37.325 --> 01:15:38.783
Mama!

01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:40.785
How do you do, Miss Paroo?

01:15:41.621 --> 01:15:42.746
How do you do?

01:15:42.955 --> 01:15:46.666
Of course, Paroo!
I thought the name sounded familiar.

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:50.712
- I've been trying to see you.
- He wants to put Winthrop in the band.

01:15:50.922 --> 01:15:52.130
MARIAN:
We're not interested.

01:15:52.298 --> 01:15:56.009
But Marian dear, the boy might have
his father's musical gift.

01:15:56.219 --> 01:15:58.220
He does have my ganglion, you know.

01:15:58.638 --> 01:16:01.431
Your husband is musical?
I'd like to talk to him.

01:16:01.849 --> 01:16:05.477
Do you always burst into people's homes
prying into personal affairs?

01:16:05.645 --> 01:16:07.229
We're not interested.

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:08.521
Marian!

01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:10.357
There's one for and one against.

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:13.235
Now, why not let
the boy's father decide?

01:16:13.819 --> 01:16:15.987
The boy's father is dead.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.616
Anything else?

01:16:19.825 --> 01:16:21.660
I am sorry.

01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:24.496
But all the more reason
he should have this!

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:29.000
My brother is an unhappy child who can't
understand why his father was taken away.

01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:33.213
Would you care to explain it to him?
He's been brooding for two years.

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:37.717
And as for your musical tricks,
go into business with a carnival man.. .

01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:40.679
. . .who sells painted watches
and glass diamond rings!

01:16:40.846 --> 01:16:43.640
HAROLD:
Musical tricks? Now, Miss Paroo!

01:16:48.521 --> 01:16:50.355
I have a feeling she likes the idea.

01:16:50.523 --> 01:16:53.358
A little cautious,
but I admire that in a woman.

01:16:53.567 --> 01:16:55.777
I'll be back later in the week.

01:16:56.112 --> 01:16:59.364
I do hope you'll excuse Marian.
She's not really--

01:16:59.532 --> 01:17:02.534
Please, don't you worry about a thing.

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:07.247
I'm sure that at heart,
she's as lovely as yourself.

01:17:08.833 --> 01:17:11.042
Good day to you, Widow Paroo.

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:38.069
- Has he gone?
- He has. And I hope not forever.

01:17:38.279 --> 01:17:40.739
Darling, don't you ever think
of your future?

01:17:41.073 --> 01:17:44.409
Now, Mama, a girl's future
doesn't depend on encouraging. . .

01:17:44.618 --> 01:17:46.703
. . .every fast-talking,
self-centered...

01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:49.080
. . .woman-chasing traveling man
who comes to town.

01:17:49.332 --> 01:17:50.999
All right, darling. All right.

01:17:51.167 --> 01:17:54.669
Only it's a well-known principle that
if you keep the flint in one drawer. . .

01:17:54.837 --> 01:17:57.547
. . .and the steel in the other
you'll never strike a fire.

01:17:57.715 --> 01:18:00.091
- Mama!
- A fine-looking man.

01:18:00.301 --> 01:18:01.426
And educated.

01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:05.180
Gary, Indiana Conservation
class of 'Aught-five.

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:09.976
That he claims his commodity is music
does not, in this case, impress me.

01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:12.145
Nor does anything else about him.

01:18:12.355 --> 01:18:13.730
I give up.

01:18:13.939 --> 01:18:17.942
At your age, if you don't mind my asking,
what are you waiting for?

01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:21.279
Not for Ed Griner, who backs me
into the history shelf. . .

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:23.114
. . .every time he's in the library.

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:24.574
He does?

01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:28.620
Or Ed Gammage who has the buggy
with the removable back seat.

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:33.249
If you're waiting for a knight in shining
white armor to come riding up the street. . ..

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:35.919
I'm not waiting for that either.

01:18:36.128 --> 01:18:38.213
Then what are you waiting for?

01:18:38.422 --> 01:18:41.883
Marian Paroo,
if you don't mind my asking...

01:18:42.093 --> 01:18:44.803

Shh.

01:22:56.889 --> 01:22:59.891
It's indecent to meet boys

Isn't this the most scrumptious
solid gold thing you ever saw?

I never thought I'd ever
see anything. ..

01:27:12.603 --> 01:27:16.272

Oh. Professor Hill, I didn't see you.

01:32:45.477 --> 01:32:46.602

01:32:46.770 --> 01:32:48.270
Well, really, I--

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:51.732
Where? They were seen!
Red-handed! Caught in the act!

01:32:51.942 --> 01:32:54.777
- Take your hands off my daughter!
- Papa!

01:32:54.945 --> 01:32:58.781
Mr. Shinn, Your Honor, your daughter
and I are going steady behind your back.

01:32:58.949 --> 01:33:02.159
- Why, you--!
- We'd rather do it in front of your back.

01:33:02.327 --> 01:33:03.369
Do what?

01:33:03.536 --> 01:33:05.329
- Well, uh--
- Never mind!

01:33:05.538 --> 01:33:07.331
Zaneeta's scared of you but I'm not.

01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:11.043
I should think you'd hate to have your
daughter scared of you. Great honk!

01:33:11.253 --> 01:33:14.129
I'll warn you once more:
If you ever touch my daughter. . .

01:33:14.339 --> 01:33:16.674
. . . I'll horsewhip you
till hell won't have it!

01:33:16.841 --> 01:33:17.883
Now, George!

01:33:18.051 --> 01:33:20.636
Not one poop out of you, Madam.

01:33:20.845 --> 01:33:22.263
I think he means "peep."

01:33:24.933 --> 01:33:26.016
Yeah.

01:33:28.728 --> 01:33:31.146
Now get out of this public emporium!

01:33:31.523 --> 01:33:34.483
I got as much right in
a public emporium as anybody!

01:33:34.693 --> 01:33:36.735
How do you get any right around here?

01:33:36.945 --> 01:33:40.364
Aiding and abetting the swindling
activities of this cymbal salesman!

01:33:40.573 --> 01:33:43.492
You know what I see written
all over you? Reform school!

01:33:43.702 --> 01:33:44.910
Now get out!

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:46.537
Get out, you wild kid!

01:33:46.705 --> 01:33:48.122

01:33:48.873 --> 01:33:53.127
It's Capulets like you make blood

01:33:53.336 --> 01:33:56.588
You watch your phraseology,
young woman!

01:33:56.798 --> 01:33:58.215
Go home.

01:34:01.344 --> 01:34:04.471
Taking up with wild kids
from the wrong side of town!

01:34:04.681 --> 01:34:06.223
If I could make you understand--

01:34:06.433 --> 01:34:08.225
Well, you can't!

01:34:08.852 --> 01:34:10.561
And thanks for the buggy ride.

01:34:10.729 --> 01:34:13.731
I read that book you gave me
from cover to cover...

01:34:13.898 --> 01:34:15.316
. . .and didn't find a thing.

01:34:15.525 --> 01:34:16.567
Mr. Mayor, please--

01:34:16.735 --> 01:34:17.943
I'll settle your hash.. .

01:34:18.111 --> 01:34:20.946
. . .as soon as I get these premises
off my oldest girl.

01:34:22.615 --> 01:34:24.283
- Yes.
- But in the meantime. . .

01:34:24.451 --> 01:34:26.618
. . . I'm vouching for Tommy Djilas.

01:34:26.828 --> 01:34:29.330
He has the confidence
of every kid in town.

01:34:29.539 --> 01:34:31.707
You'll be waiting to shake his hand. . .

01:34:31.916 --> 01:34:33.917
. . .when our band
plays its first concert.

01:34:34.127 --> 01:34:36.545
By that time,
my fine young feathered. ..

01:34:36.755 --> 01:34:39.048
. . .my feathered young,
my feathered fine--

01:34:39.257 --> 01:34:40.841
Never mind!

01:34:45.847 --> 01:34:47.931
Oliver! Jacey! Ewart! Olin!

01:34:48.099 --> 01:34:50.976
I want that man's references
and I want them tonight.

01:34:51.186 --> 01:34:54.563
He's slipperier than
a Mississippi...sturgeon.

01:34:55.523 --> 01:34:57.941
I think Mayor Shinn behaved abominably.

01:34:58.151 --> 01:35:01.278
And it was wonderful of you,
sticking up for Tommy Djilas.

01:35:01.446 --> 01:35:04.198
- Oh, that was nothing.
- Yes, it was.

01:35:04.574 --> 01:35:09.119
A man can't go back on his principles
because personal risk is involved.

01:35:09.329 --> 01:35:10.913
What does the poet say?

01:35:11.122 --> 01:35:15.125
A coward dies 1000 deaths.
A brave man.. .

01:35:15.293 --> 01:35:17.127
. . .only 500.

01:35:17.295 --> 01:35:18.962
- Something like that.
- Thank you.

01:35:19.381 --> 01:35:21.340
Get his papers or get him in jail!

01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:23.342
I couldn't make myself clearer. . .

01:35:23.551 --> 01:35:25.636
. . .if I was a buttonhook
in well water.

01:35:30.475 --> 01:35:33.143
I want to talk to you
about Winthrop's cornet.

01:35:33.311 --> 01:35:37.272
A beautiful instrument.
Hammered brass, mother-of-pearl keys.

01:35:37.482 --> 01:35:41.026
But he never touches it. He said
you told him it wasn't necessary.

01:35:41.986 --> 01:35:43.153
You must understand--

01:35:43.363 --> 01:35:46.115
Something about a "Think System."

01:35:46.324 --> 01:35:49.660
He says if he thinks the "Minuet in G"
he can play it.

01:35:49.869 --> 01:35:52.996
I admit it's still
in the experimental stages.

01:35:53.206 --> 01:35:56.875
To a seasoned professional like yourself
it may seem ludicrous.

01:35:57.293 --> 01:35:59.294
You mustn't say that.

01:36:01.214 --> 01:36:02.840
- I mustn't?
- No.

01:36:03.258 --> 01:36:06.844
Throughout history the true
originator is always laughed at.

01:36:07.053 --> 01:36:10.556
I hope you don't class me with
those small minds who ridiculed--

01:36:10.765 --> 01:36:13.559
- Galileo.
- Yes, and his conception of the heavens.

01:36:13.768 --> 01:36:15.144
Or Fulton.

01:36:15.353 --> 01:36:18.605
- Yes. Or Columbus.
- And his conception of the egg--

01:36:18.815 --> 01:36:20.274
Globe!

01:36:21.443 --> 01:36:24.194
The one thing one must remember,
no matter who one is. . .

01:36:24.362 --> 01:36:25.821
. . .or what one is working for. . .

01:36:25.989 --> 01:36:29.199
. . .one can do anything
if one puts one's mind to it.

01:36:30.201 --> 01:36:31.493
Miss Marian...

01:36:31.703 --> 01:36:36.039
. . .if one could only tell you
how much you've done for one.

01:36:37.876 --> 01:36:41.170
I would deem it a great privilege
to talk with you again.

01:36:42.130 --> 01:36:43.797
Well, all I said--

01:36:43.965 --> 01:36:46.508
May one call upon you some evening?

01:36:49.554 --> 01:36:51.680
Any night this week.

01:37:15.205 --> 01:37:16.497
Good evening, gentlemen.

01:37:19.459 --> 01:37:21.585
Sorry, professor,
but we got our orders.

Every time I try to give you
those credentials. . .

01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:32.846
. . .you always try to
change the subject somehow.

01:37:33.056 --> 01:37:36.558
It's like a conspiracy.
I'll go up in my room and get them.

01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:40.604
- Sorry! Afraid I'll have to go with you.
- Oh, yes.

01:37:41.231 --> 01:37:43.232
Let's see if I have my key.

Will you ever stop arguing

Will you ever tell him?
Won't you ever tell him? Yes! No!

01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:37.359
Fiddlesticks! Open your mouth
and let it come out.

01:42:37.568 --> 01:42:38.944
- Now, Mama--
- Now, nothing.

01:42:39.153 --> 01:42:41.696
If he ever calls again,
you see him alone...

01:42:41.989 --> 01:42:44.741

01:42:44.909 --> 01:42:48.745
MARIAN: Tell him?
- Nothing wrong with a ladylike hint.

01:42:49.163 --> 01:42:51.414
Ah! What's that thing you got?

01:42:51.624 --> 01:42:55.168
It's a genuine Hercules
combination pocketknife and tool kit. . .

01:42:55.378 --> 01:42:58.588
. . .with a solid stag handle
and six sturdy steel blades.

01:42:58.756 --> 01:43:00.715
Blessed Martin of Tours!

01:43:01.092 --> 01:43:04.469
One spear blade, one sheep's foot blade,
one small pen blade. . .

01:43:04.679 --> 01:43:08.890
. . .a swagging awl, a file and
a combination tack puller and screwdriver.

01:43:09.183 --> 01:43:11.476
Where'd you pick up
that horrible weapon?

01:43:11.686 --> 01:43:13.144
It was a present.

01:43:13.354 --> 01:43:14.396
From Harold.

01:43:14.605 --> 01:43:16.690
- Professor Hill?
- Uh-huh.

01:43:16.858 --> 01:43:19.025
He says if I stick around River City. . .

01:43:19.235 --> 01:43:21.194
. . . I better learn to whittle and spit.

01:43:21.404 --> 01:43:23.405
I got the spitting down pretty good.

01:43:23.948 --> 01:43:28.243
Winthrop, what do you and Harold
find to talk about?

01:43:28.619 --> 01:43:32.455
Sometimes we talk business
and sometimes just plain talk.

01:43:32.623 --> 01:43:35.083
He talks about his hometown,
Gary, Indiana.

01:43:35.293 --> 01:43:37.294
He said he'd take me there someday.

01:43:37.670 --> 01:43:39.379
Isn't that nice?

01:43:39.797 --> 01:43:43.300

Do the Shinns live
around here somewhere?

01:45:05.508 --> 01:45:07.634
The Shinn home is on East Elm.
This is West Elm.

01:45:07.802 --> 01:45:10.053
Mm, criminy.

01:45:11.472 --> 01:45:13.556
Oh. I see you're the
piano teacher here in town.

01:45:14.892 --> 01:45:18.103
You must know about this fellow Hill
forming a boys' band here.

01:45:18.312 --> 01:45:23.066
Don't let that worry you no more.
I got the goods on him in spades.

01:45:23.275 --> 01:45:25.735
That swindling, two-bit
thimblerigger!

01:45:25.903 --> 01:45:28.405
That's why I got to see Shinn.
I'm just passing through. . .

01:45:28.572 --> 01:45:31.491
. . .and number 8 only makes
a 15-minute water stop and--

01:45:33.077 --> 01:45:34.744
Ooh.

01:45:35.246 --> 01:45:37.163
I wish it was 20.

01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:42.419
Sure could concentrate five minutes
on you, girlie-girl.

01:45:43.045 --> 01:45:44.087
Who are you?

01:45:44.588 --> 01:45:47.507
Name's Charlie Cowell.
Anvil salesman.

01:45:50.344 --> 01:45:52.762
But now I've got heavier things
on my mind.

01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:57.726
I've got to protect the good name
of the traveling fraternity from Hill.

01:45:58.519 --> 01:46:01.730
Mr. Cowell,
you're making a big mistake.

01:46:01.939 --> 01:46:04.607
Mistake, my old lady's corset cover!

01:46:04.817 --> 01:46:06.609
He's been the raspberry seed. . .

01:46:06.819 --> 01:46:09.946
. . .in my wisdom tooth just long enough.

01:46:10.114 --> 01:46:12.699
He spoiled lllinois for me.
But he won't spoil Iowa.

01:46:13.075 --> 01:46:15.660
You're a music teacher.
You didn't see through him?

01:46:15.870 --> 01:46:18.538
- He's no more professor--
- I know all about that.

01:46:18.748 --> 01:46:21.207
Bandleaders are always called professor.

01:46:21.417 --> 01:46:24.669
It's an academic courtesy.
He's a fine director--

01:46:24.879 --> 01:46:28.131
Now wait a minute!

01:46:28.299 --> 01:46:29.758
Fine director?

01:46:29.967 --> 01:46:32.594
Tell me, you heard one note
of music from any band?

01:46:33.637 --> 01:46:35.638
Well, no, but--

01:46:35.806 --> 01:46:40.143
But nothing, girlie-girl.
He never formed a band in his life.

01:46:40.311 --> 01:46:42.312
And you think he ever will?

01:46:42.521 --> 01:46:44.355
Not on your previous existence!

01:46:44.565 --> 01:46:45.940
Just listen a minute--

01:46:46.150 --> 01:46:47.776
I'd like to.

01:46:50.154 --> 01:46:53.114
I'd like to do more than that
if I had the time.

01:46:53.657 --> 01:46:55.366
Sure got the inclination.

01:46:57.078 --> 01:47:01.456
But I got to leave this dynamite
with somebody on the way to the depot.

01:47:02.374 --> 01:47:05.502
Bye, girlie-girl. I'll see you
next time I come through.

01:47:07.671 --> 01:47:11.132
You'll never make that train
at the depot. Catch it at the crossing.

01:47:11.342 --> 01:47:16.179
I've got to leave word, and I can see
you ain't the one to leave it with.

01:47:16.347 --> 01:47:17.847
Wait a minute!

01:47:18.015 --> 01:47:19.474
Mr. Cowell.

01:47:25.106 --> 01:47:28.024
You don't know me very well yet.

01:47:30.361 --> 01:47:33.571
Is that an invitation, girlie-girl?

01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:37.200
No. I mean, I don't know you.

01:47:37.368 --> 01:47:39.702
I'd need more time anyway.

01:47:39.912 --> 01:47:41.955
What I mean is. . .

01:47:42.164 --> 01:47:45.708
. . .as well as I'd like to.

01:47:47.378 --> 01:47:50.171
Oh. There's no trouble there. ..

01:47:50.381 --> 01:47:52.090
. . .girlie-girl!

01:47:53.759 --> 01:47:56.219
I've never met a man. ..

01:47:56.387 --> 01:47:58.513
. . .who sells anvils before.

01:47:59.557 --> 01:48:01.391
It's really quite. . .

01:48:02.268 --> 01:48:03.893
. . .different.

01:48:06.355 --> 01:48:09.399
Takes a real salesman,
I can tell you that.

01:48:09.608 --> 01:48:12.318
Anvils have a limited appeal, you know.

01:48:18.742 --> 01:48:20.451
What am I doing?

01:48:20.661 --> 01:48:22.912
If I miss that train, I'll lose my job.

01:48:23.122 --> 01:48:25.081
And I got to leave word about Hill.

01:48:26.083 --> 01:48:27.167
Leave word with me.

01:48:27.376 --> 01:48:31.462
Not on your tintype, girlie-girl.

01:48:31.630 --> 01:48:34.215
How do I know
you'll deliver these letters?

01:48:34.383 --> 01:48:35.800
Try me.

01:48:47.771 --> 01:48:49.606
There's your train! Run for it!

01:48:49.815 --> 01:48:53.776
You double-dealing--
Who do you think you're protecting?

01:48:54.361 --> 01:48:57.280
That guy's got a gal
in every county in lllinois. . .

01:48:57.489 --> 01:49:01.451
. . .and he's taken it away from
every one of them. That's 102 counties!

01:49:03.037 --> 01:49:07.582
Not counting the piano teachers
like you he cozies up to. ..

01:49:07.791 --> 01:49:10.126
. . .just to keep your mouths shut!

01:49:10.502 --> 01:49:13.630

heard the last of me, girlie-girl!

01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:35.461
Ladies mostly, I thought.

01:50:35.713 --> 01:50:38.881
Yes. Mrs. Squires
and several of the other ladies.

01:50:39.049 --> 01:50:40.425
I'm glad.

01:50:40.926 --> 01:50:43.303
I wouldn't want anyone beating my time.

01:50:46.807 --> 01:50:48.182
"You wouldn't?"

01:50:49.977 --> 01:50:51.227
"No, ma'am."

01:50:53.605 --> 01:50:56.274
It's evidently not
the convenient evening.

01:50:56.817 --> 01:50:58.359
I'll see you at the sociable.

01:50:58.569 --> 01:51:01.487
Professor Hill, is it true
that you've had 100--?

01:51:02.906 --> 01:51:05.241
- What I'm trying to say is--
- Yes?

01:51:05.826 --> 01:51:07.660
I was wondering...

01:51:09.163 --> 01:51:12.915
. . .how you developed the Think System.

01:51:13.083 --> 01:51:14.584
The Think System?

01:51:15.252 --> 01:51:16.669
Oh, the Think System!

01:51:16.879 --> 01:51:20.757
It's quite simple, really.
It's as simple as whistling.

01:51:20.966 --> 01:51:24.135
No one had to develop an
elaborate technique for whistling.

01:51:24.345 --> 01:51:26.471
You simply think the tune up here...

01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:28.973
. . .and it comes out clearly here.

01:51:32.603 --> 01:51:35.104
Now just suppose you try this yourself.

01:51:36.482 --> 01:51:37.899
I'll take your word for it.

01:51:39.526 --> 01:51:41.527
Why don't we all sit down?

01:51:42.363 --> 01:51:45.615
Are all music teachers
as dense as I am?

01:51:46.992 --> 01:51:48.409
All music teachers?

01:51:49.495 --> 01:51:53.206
I daresay you've met dozens.
Maybe even a hundred.

01:51:53.874 --> 01:51:57.377
- Well--
- Are they all as fascinated as I...

01:51:59.630 --> 01:52:01.506
. . .with the Think System?

01:52:01.965 --> 01:52:03.674
Some more and some less.

01:52:03.884 --> 01:52:06.969
One young lady had thought
up the same system.

01:52:07.221 --> 01:52:08.805
She showed me a few refinements.

01:52:10.140 --> 01:52:11.391
I see.

01:52:11.809 --> 01:52:13.643
Have I said something wrong?

01:52:14.645 --> 01:52:17.021
Please don't let me keep you.

01:52:17.231 --> 01:52:19.482
You must have more important
things to do. ..

01:52:19.650 --> 01:52:22.026
. . .than explain the Think System to me.

01:52:22.236 --> 01:52:24.278
Nope, can't think of one.
Come, let's sit.

01:52:24.488 --> 01:52:27.949
I must be very dull company
for a man of your experience.

01:52:28.158 --> 01:52:31.077
Now where'd you ever get
an idea like that? Heh-heh.

01:52:31.537 --> 01:52:34.038
One hears rumors about
traveling salesmen.

01:52:34.248 --> 01:52:37.333
Oh, now, you mustn't
believe everything you hear.

01:52:37.543 --> 01:52:41.337
After all, one even hears rumors
about librarians.

01:52:42.798 --> 01:52:45.133
I presume you're referring
to Uncle Maddy?

01:52:46.176 --> 01:52:50.054
- Uncle Maddy?
- Mr. Madison, my father's best friend.

01:52:50.264 --> 01:52:53.474
No matter what they say,
he left that library job to me. . .

01:52:53.684 --> 01:52:56.310
. . .so Mother, Winthrop and l
could have security.

01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:58.271
Surely, you don't believe--

01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:00.857
No, but that's just what I'm saying.

01:53:01.066 --> 01:53:03.276
Why do you suppose
people start rumors?

01:53:03.694 --> 01:53:05.278
Narrow-mindedness, jealousy.

01:53:05.696 --> 01:53:07.113
Jealousy mostly, I guess.

01:53:07.322 --> 01:53:08.364
Exactly!

01:53:08.574 --> 01:53:11.868
And jealousy mostly starts
rumors about traveling salesmen.

01:53:25.674 --> 01:53:27.341
What have you heard?

01:53:28.385 --> 01:53:29.469
Oh.

01:53:29.636 --> 01:53:32.180
Nothing about you personally.
It's just...

01:53:32.389 --> 01:53:34.640
. . .you know, generally.

01:53:36.268 --> 01:53:38.895
What have you heard generally?

01:53:40.063 --> 01:53:41.522
Just that--

01:53:43.025 --> 01:53:45.067
But of course!

01:53:45.861 --> 01:53:50.740
It stands to reason that disappointment
and jealousy can lead to--

01:53:50.949 --> 01:53:55.244
Well, take you, for instance.
Your attentions to customers. ..

01:53:55.412 --> 01:53:58.414
. . .and teachers might easily be
misconstrued, mightn't they?

01:53:58.916 --> 01:54:01.584
I mean now, honestly, mightn't they?

01:54:01.752 --> 01:54:05.254
And as you say, if a salesman
or somebody were jealous.. .

01:54:05.464 --> 01:54:08.591
. . .they could be downright lies,
now, couldn't they?

01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:11.427
- What could?
- Rumors and things!

01:54:11.595 --> 01:54:12.803
Of course!

01:54:13.013 --> 01:54:16.390
It goes to show, you should never
believe everything you hear!

01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:19.810
I mean, if you just discuss things!

01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:21.938
I'd be delighted to discuss. . .

01:54:22.105 --> 01:54:25.107
. . .anything in the world with you.

01:54:26.193 --> 01:54:28.236
But couldn't we do it sitting down?

01:54:29.696 --> 01:54:30.780
You do sit?

01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:33.741
Your knees bend and all?

01:54:35.035 --> 01:54:38.246
We could sit on the steps, I suppose.

01:54:38.455 --> 01:54:40.957
Or on the large hollow log
over at the footbridge.

01:54:41.458 --> 01:54:43.918
No, I couldn't do that.

01:54:45.087 --> 01:54:47.797
I've never been to the footbridge
with a man in my life.

01:54:48.131 --> 01:54:49.465
Just to talk.

01:54:51.301 --> 01:54:53.803
I have to dress for the sociable.

01:54:57.641 --> 01:54:59.976
Then meet me there in 15 minutes.

01:55:00.894 --> 01:55:02.728
No, I can't.

01:55:02.938 --> 01:55:04.438
Please.

01:55:04.982 --> 01:55:07.900
Some other time.
Maybe tomorrow.

01:55:08.986 --> 01:55:10.444
Please.

01:55:11.947 --> 01:55:15.283
Oh, my dear little librarian!

01:55:15.659 --> 01:55:18.369
You pile up enough tomorrows
and you'll collect. . .

01:55:18.579 --> 01:55:21.914
. . .nothing but a lot
of empty yesterdays.

01:55:23.875 --> 01:55:25.751
I don't know about you. . .

01:55:26.670 --> 01:55:29.463
. . .but I'd like to make today
worth remembering.

01:55:31.508 --> 01:55:33.759
Oh. . . .

01:55:34.678 --> 01:55:36.304
So would I .

01:55:40.267 --> 01:55:41.976
The footbridge. . .

01:55:42.185 --> 01:55:43.853
. . . 15 minutes.

01:55:53.822 --> 01:55:55.865
Fifteen minutes.

01:56:13.050 --> 01:56:15.134
MARIAN: Mama!
- What?!

01:56:15.802 --> 01:56:19.472
I told the professor I'd meet him
at the footbridge in 15 minutes.

01:56:19.681 --> 01:56:21.641
Glory be and the saints be praised!

01:56:21.808 --> 01:56:23.392
- It works!
- What works?

01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:28.230
I been using the "Tink" System
on you from the parlor.

01:56:50.003 --> 01:56:52.838
Any of you people Mayor Shinn?

01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:19.407
Please, you got to clear this area.

01:57:19.616 --> 01:57:22.076
Mrs. Shinn wants
to start the entertainment.

01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:25.037
No, we want to dance.

01:57:26.456 --> 01:57:29.125
Wait'll you see the new steps
Professor Hill taught us.

01:57:29.292 --> 01:57:32.461
Mr. Washburn,
my group is ready to perform.

01:57:34.631 --> 01:57:36.924
- Start her out.
- Okay, what'll it be?

01:57:37.134 --> 01:57:38.300

This is no place to talk.
You won't back down?

02:02:53.700 --> 02:02:56.076
I'll come, but I promised
Mother and Winthrop. . .

02:02:56.286 --> 02:03:00.122
. . .to have a plate of cream with them.
You go along, I'll meet you.

02:03:01.124 --> 02:03:06.837
Fifteen minutes.

02:03:18.308 --> 02:03:21.935
SHINN: And now we arrive
at the high-water mark...

02:03:22.145 --> 02:03:23.812
. . .of the evening's festivities.

02:03:24.314 --> 02:03:27.483
The River City Ladies'
Eurhythmic Dance Group. . .

02:03:27.692 --> 02:03:30.486
. . .under the leadership of my wife. . .

02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:34.490
. . .will give their interpretation of....

EULALIE:
Psst.

02:03:36.326 --> 02:03:38.869
Grecian urns!

02:03:39.412 --> 02:03:41.997
Yes. Grecian urns.

02:03:44.459 --> 02:03:45.751
Psst. Psst.

02:04:09.359 --> 02:04:12.069
One Grecian urn.

02:05:24.809 --> 02:05:26.977
Miss Marian, you're late.

02:05:28.104 --> 02:05:31.899
- You said 15 minutes.
- Not that kind of late. I meant. . . .

02:05:32.108 --> 02:05:33.609
I'd say about. . .

02:05:33.776 --> 02:05:35.319
. . .26 years late.

02:05:35.528 --> 02:05:38.947
It took you all this time to get
to the footbridge with a fella.

02:05:39.532 --> 02:05:42.451
If you want to know the truth,
it was almost longer.

02:05:42.619 --> 02:05:44.536
- Oh?
- Halfway here. ..

02:05:44.746 --> 02:05:46.788
. . . I nearly turned back.

02:05:47.207 --> 02:05:50.209
I suppose I'm not
the first person to discover...

02:05:50.418 --> 02:05:53.629
. . .a girl doesn't think clearly
under the spell of your salesmanship.

02:05:55.131 --> 02:05:59.176
You surely don't think I've
been trying to sell you anything?

02:05:59.385 --> 02:06:00.969
Oh, no.

02:06:01.137 --> 02:06:04.306
You've given me something.
That's why I had to come.

02:06:05.683 --> 02:06:07.392
- I don't recall giving you--
- Yes.

02:06:08.144 --> 02:06:09.603
Something beautiful.

02:06:09.812 --> 02:06:11.813
That's why I came.

02:06:12.315 --> 02:06:13.649
And I'm so glad.

02:06:15.026 --> 02:06:17.653
Please don't be afraid
I expect too much more.

02:06:18.321 --> 02:06:21.323
One can't expect
a traveling salesman to stay put.

02:06:21.491 --> 02:06:24.826
There've been many ports of call
and there'll be many more.

02:06:25.036 --> 02:06:28.747
Still, I can be grateful
for what you've left behind.

02:06:28.957 --> 02:06:30.249
For me.

Marian.

02:09:16.833 --> 02:09:19.209
There's lots you don't know about me.

02:09:21.421 --> 02:09:23.046
I'm not asking.

02:09:24.924 --> 02:09:26.341
Excuse me.

02:09:27.176 --> 02:09:30.262
I'm expecting a telegram from Rudi Friml.

02:09:30.471 --> 02:09:32.347
This could be it.

02:09:37.562 --> 02:09:41.189
Who's the salesman? Looks like
she's selling and you're buying.

02:09:41.399 --> 02:09:42.983
I have to keep her off balance.

02:09:43.276 --> 02:09:46.528
She's as off balance as
a catboat in a hurricane.

02:09:46.737 --> 02:09:48.780
It's just until those uniforms arrive.

02:09:48.990 --> 02:09:51.283
They're here and the kids are in them.

02:09:51.868 --> 02:09:55.328
Tommy passed out the uniforms
and collected most of the money.

02:09:55.538 --> 02:09:59.458
Now he's pretending there's
a band practice at the lumberyard.

02:10:00.001 --> 02:10:03.378
- What time's the freight train go?
- 9:40 from the junction.

02:10:03.588 --> 02:10:05.172
It isn't even 8:30 yet.

02:10:05.506 --> 02:10:07.674
You better cheese it now while you can!

02:10:07.884 --> 02:10:10.510
I came up through the ranks
on this skirmish.

02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:12.804
I won't resign without my commission.

02:10:13.097 --> 02:10:14.848
Now go on, beat it!

02:10:19.437 --> 02:10:22.564
Never a peaceful moment
in the music business.

02:10:24.317 --> 02:10:25.525
Now where were we?

02:10:26.903 --> 02:10:29.571
You were going to tell me
what I don't know about you.

02:10:31.532 --> 02:10:33.366
Yeah.

02:10:34.118 --> 02:10:36.411
But we don't have to go
into that right now.

02:10:37.538 --> 02:10:39.331
Of course not.

02:10:40.166 --> 02:10:42.417
We never have to go into that, Harold.

02:10:43.544 --> 02:10:47.631
Madam Librarian, you are a lady
from the ground up.

02:10:47.882 --> 02:10:51.259
The librarian hasn't felt much like
doing research lately.

02:10:52.178 --> 02:10:54.804
But she did plenty of it
when you first came here.

02:10:55.223 --> 02:10:56.681
Oh.

02:10:56.849 --> 02:10:57.891
About what?

02:10:58.351 --> 02:11:01.728
Oh. About Professor Harold Hill.. .

02:11:01.938 --> 02:11:05.232
. . .Gary Conservatory of Music,
Gold Medal Class of '05.

02:11:08.110 --> 02:11:09.152
Harold. . .

02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:12.489
. . .there wasn't any
Gary Conservatory in '05.

02:11:13.449 --> 02:11:14.908
Well, there most cert--

02:11:15.076 --> 02:11:17.702
The town wasn't even built until '06.

02:11:20.498 --> 02:11:21.748
Walk me home.

02:11:21.958 --> 02:11:24.918
I have to get something
to draw around my shoulders.

02:11:26.462 --> 02:11:27.837
You knew all the time.

02:11:28.798 --> 02:11:31.758
I've known since
three days after you came here.

02:11:34.679 --> 02:11:37.472
I tore this out of the Indiana Journal.

02:11:37.682 --> 02:11:40.058
I meant to use it against you.

02:11:40.768 --> 02:11:42.769
Now I give it to you with all my heart.

02:11:45.523 --> 02:11:47.315

Listen to this man.

02:12:39.243 --> 02:12:42.370

Can't you see this music fella's
giving you the double shuffle!

02:12:50.796 --> 02:12:52.380
He's putting the shake on you. . .

02:12:52.590 --> 02:12:56.176
. . .taking out your eyeteeth
while you look the other way.

02:12:56.385 --> 02:12:57.636
What are you saying?

02:12:57.970 --> 02:12:59.721
I'll tell you what I'm saying!

02:12:59.889 --> 02:13:04.517
This burglar's in the bedroom
while you're fiddling in the parlor!

02:13:05.227 --> 02:13:07.228
Whose bedroom are
the burglars fiddling in?

02:13:07.396 --> 02:13:08.438
Quiet.

02:13:08.648 --> 02:13:10.523
CHARLIE:
I'm talking about Harold Hill.

02:13:10.733 --> 02:13:12.025
A shell worker.

02:13:12.318 --> 02:13:13.485
A flimflammer!

02:13:13.694 --> 02:13:15.737
An eighteen-karat thief!

02:13:15.905 --> 02:13:17.405
You mean the music professor?

02:13:17.573 --> 02:13:19.407
Music professor?

02:13:19.617 --> 02:13:22.410
Not on your fireless cooker, mister!

02:13:22.578 --> 02:13:23.912
Fellow that organized the band?

02:13:24.246 --> 02:13:26.831
There ain't any band.
There ain't never been a band.

02:13:27.041 --> 02:13:29.250
There ain't never going to be a band!

02:13:29.418 --> 02:13:32.420
Unless you hunt this man down now
like a mad dog. . .

02:13:32.588 --> 02:13:34.673
. . .there won't be a Harold Hill either.

02:13:34.924 --> 02:13:36.841
He'll be on his way to the state line.

02:13:37.051 --> 02:13:40.136
I said all along,
get his credentials, didn't I?

02:13:40.346 --> 02:13:43.181
I got his credentials right here!

02:13:43.432 --> 02:13:45.225
Well, what are we waiting for?

02:13:45.726 --> 02:13:46.810
I want my money back.

02:13:47.019 --> 02:13:48.061
I want his hide!

Roped and hogtied, if you have to.

02:13:52.775 --> 02:13:54.567
And don't let him give you the slip.

02:13:54.777 --> 02:13:56.277

02:14:50.166 --> 02:14:52.417

Try the freight depot!

02:17:41.295 --> 02:17:42.337
Let's go, Greg.

02:17:42.504 --> 02:17:44.964
The flivver's in the alley,
all cranked up!

02:17:45.841 --> 02:17:47.842
They're onto you!
That anvil salesman...

02:17:48.010 --> 02:17:50.803
. . .is running all over town
spilling everything!

02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:53.013
Come on!

02:17:55.267 --> 02:17:59.102
Run, professor!
They're talking about tar and feathers.

02:17:59.313 --> 02:18:02.357
I've looked all over for Winthrop.
He's run away.

02:18:02.566 --> 02:18:04.359
Maybe he's in his room.

02:18:10.824 --> 02:18:12.909
It's not often I'm at a loss for words--

02:18:13.118 --> 02:18:15.452
It's all right.
Don't you know that?

02:18:15.663 --> 02:18:17.580
You don't owe me a word,
not a word.

02:18:17.790 --> 02:18:19.749
Now hurry, please!

02:18:21.709 --> 02:18:23.210
Greg!

02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:27.382
He's not around here, folks!

02:18:28.049 --> 02:18:29.634
Let's try by the creamery.

02:18:35.474 --> 02:18:38.518
- Whoa. Hold on a minute, son.
- I'm not your son. Leave me go!

02:18:38.686 --> 02:18:40.645
Not until I talk to you a minute.

02:18:40.813 --> 02:18:43.189
I won't listen.
You wouldn't tell the truth anyway.

02:18:43.357 --> 02:18:44.440
- I would too.
- Would tot!

02:18:44.608 --> 02:18:46.901
Tell you anything you want to know.

02:18:47.986 --> 02:18:49.320
Can you lead a band?

02:18:52.199 --> 02:18:53.241
No!

02:18:54.575 --> 02:18:56.952
- Are you a big liar?
- Yes.

02:18:57.413 --> 02:18:59.246
- Are you a dirty, rotten crook?
- Yes.

02:18:59.415 --> 02:19:01.833
Then leave me go, you big liar!

02:19:02.041 --> 02:19:04.252
You wanted the truth, didn't you?

02:19:04.460 --> 02:19:06.504
I'm bigger than you,
and you're getting it all.

02:19:06.714 --> 02:19:08.630
So just stop wiggling.

02:19:09.758 --> 02:19:11.049
Now.. . .

02:19:11.218 --> 02:19:13.593
There are two things
you're entitled to know.

02:19:13.804 --> 02:19:16.222
One, you're a wonderful kid.

02:19:16.557 --> 02:19:19.517
I thought so from the first.
That's why I wanted you in the band. . .

02:19:19.684 --> 02:19:22.770
. . .so you'd stop moping around
and feeling sorry for yourself.

02:19:24.022 --> 02:19:25.815
What band?

02:19:28.693 --> 02:19:30.528
I always think there's a band, kid.

02:19:31.405 --> 02:19:33.448
WINTHROP: What's the other thing
I'm entitled to know?

02:19:36.618 --> 02:19:39.037
That's none of your business,
come to think of it.

02:19:39.245 --> 02:19:41.581
I wish you never came to River City.

02:19:44.126 --> 02:19:45.459
No, you don't, Winthrop.

02:19:47.838 --> 02:19:50.048
Sister, you believe him?

02:19:53.260 --> 02:19:55.344
I believe everything he ever said.

02:19:57.056 --> 02:19:59.307
WINTHROP:
But he promised us!

02:19:59.641 --> 02:20:03.811
I know what he promised us,
and it all happened just like he said:

02:20:03.979 --> 02:20:07.106
The lights, the colors,
the cymbals and the flags.

02:20:08.025 --> 02:20:09.358
Where was all that?

02:20:10.152 --> 02:20:13.362
In the way every kid in town
walked around all summer. . .

02:20:13.572 --> 02:20:15.239
. . .and looked and acted.

02:20:15.449 --> 02:20:17.116
Especially you.

02:20:17.326 --> 02:20:19.410
And the parents too.

02:20:20.329 --> 02:20:22.246
Does Mama wish he'd never come?

02:20:23.123 --> 02:20:25.041
Well, you do, don't you?

02:20:27.044 --> 02:20:28.753
No, Winthrop.

02:20:31.924 --> 02:20:34.050
You'd better go, Harold. Please!

02:20:35.511 --> 02:20:37.470
Go on, professor.

02:20:37.846 --> 02:20:39.263
Hurry up.

02:20:40.140 --> 02:20:41.849
I can't go, Winthrop.

02:20:43.352 --> 02:20:44.435
Why not?

02:20:46.063 --> 02:20:48.356
Well, for the first time in my life. . .

02:20:50.150 --> 02:20:52.360
. . . I got my foot caught in the door.

02:20:59.284 --> 02:21:01.035
There was love

02:21:02.329 --> 02:21:03.788
All around

02:21:05.082 --> 02:21:09.377
But I never heard it singing

02:21:10.879 --> 02:21:15.967
No, I never heard it at all

02:21:21.181 --> 02:21:23.057
Till there was you.

02:21:29.898 --> 02:21:31.399
MARCELLUS:
Greg!

02:21:32.109 --> 02:21:33.234
Greg, they're here!

02:21:33.402 --> 02:21:34.652
Run this way!

02:21:34.862 --> 02:21:37.029
Go on, professor! That way, that way!

02:22:06.685 --> 02:22:10.146
SHINN: And always remember,
fellow River City-zeeans. . .

02:22:10.355 --> 02:22:12.940
. . . I did everything in my power
to prevent this dire. . .

02:22:13.108 --> 02:22:14.859
. . .happening from...

How will you get our money back?

02:22:20.032 --> 02:22:24.410
That professor collected almost
$300 on uniforms just tonight.

02:22:25.162 --> 02:22:29.248
I haven't seen a uniform or my boy
either since just after supper.

02:22:29.458 --> 02:22:30.917
He's a kidnapper!

02:22:31.126 --> 02:22:33.002

Just a minute!

Virtue has triumphed!

. . .Professor Harold Hill.

02:23:02.991 --> 02:23:05.743
And if there are those,
as I've heard.. .

02:23:05.953 --> 02:23:09.330
. . .who are melting tar
and plucking feathers. . .

02:23:09.623 --> 02:23:11.958
. . . I will not say them nay!

02:23:12.542 --> 02:23:16.712
I should think some of you could forget
your everlasting Iowa stubbornness. . .

02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:20.716
. . .long enough to remember what
this town was like before Harold Hill came.

02:23:21.843 --> 02:23:23.219
Do you?

02:23:23.387 --> 02:23:24.845
- Well, do you?
- Hold up, there!

02:23:25.013 --> 02:23:26.555
And then after he came!

02:23:27.349 --> 02:23:29.934
Suddenly there were things to do. . .

02:23:30.143 --> 02:23:32.395
. . .and things to be proud of. . .

02:23:32.604 --> 02:23:35.439
. . .and people to go
out of your way for.

02:23:36.024 --> 02:23:40.695
Surely some of you can be grateful
for what this man has brought to us.

02:23:41.196 --> 02:23:42.863
I'd think you'd want to admit it!

02:23:43.073 --> 02:23:45.574
You're wasting a great deal of time!

02:23:45.784 --> 02:23:47.535
If there's a person in this hall. ..

02:23:47.703 --> 02:23:51.289
. . .who doesn't want this man
Hill tarred and feathered. . .

02:23:51.498 --> 02:23:54.041
. . .let him, by God, stand up!

02:24:31.747 --> 02:24:33.080
Eulalie, sit down!

02:24:40.255 --> 02:24:44.759
And the rest of you, who are standing
there like Shropshire sheep!

02:24:44.968 --> 02:24:47.053
Maybe you can remember other things.

02:24:47.262 --> 02:24:49.138
Like what you paid for uniforms. . .

02:24:49.514 --> 02:24:52.725

and band instruments.

02:24:52.934 --> 02:24:54.435
With the understanding. ..

02:24:54.603 --> 02:24:57.104
. . .your children would be taught
to play in a band!

02:24:57.564 --> 02:25:00.274
Well, where's the band?

02:25:00.484 --> 02:25:02.777
Where's the band?!
