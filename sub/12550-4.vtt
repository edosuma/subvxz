01:07.600 --> 01:09.200
After 3,000 years,

01:09.200 --> 01:11.920
the doorway to your people
can be opened again.

01:11.920 --> 01:15.960
And what then? Invasion? The Gorgons
need us to survive, Miss Smith.

01:15.960 --> 01:18.120
Opening the portal to their world

01:18.120 --> 01:21.720
isn't opening the door to invasion,
but salvation.

01:21.720 --> 01:23.280
What have you done to my dad?

01:23.280 --> 01:25.840
Pay heed to the Gorgon's warning

01:25.840 --> 01:28.000
and don't interfere.

01:29.560 --> 01:31.320
Dad?

01:33.120 --> 01:34.600
Mother Abbess?

01:39.720 --> 01:41.440
He can't be.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.800
He can't.

01:43.800 --> 01:47.280
I didn't mean to shout at you, Dad.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:47.280 --> 01:50.000
Listen to me, Maria.
You are not going to lose it.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.680
You are not going to fall apart.
Understand me?

01:52.680 --> 01:55.480
Whatever happened to your father,
there's one thing

01:55.480 --> 01:57.200
I've learned in all these years.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.520
There is always a chance.
Do you hear me?

01:59.520 --> 02:01.400
Mum was right.

02:01.400 --> 02:05.520
I shouldn't have had anything
to do with you. It's all your fault!

02:05.520 --> 02:08.560
I wish I'd never seen
that alien in your garden!

02:08.560 --> 02:10.280
I wish I'd never seen you!

02:10.280 --> 02:13.680
Everything was fine till
we moved here! Everything was fine!

02:15.640 --> 02:18.520
I know, Maria, I know.
But we have to try.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.960
We have to try to put things right.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.160
What's happening, Luke?

02:26.160 --> 02:29.720
Is Sarah Jane really going to give
that Gorgon thing the talisman?

02:29.720 --> 02:32.320
No! If the Gorgon only wanted
to go home,

02:32.320 --> 02:35.920
why was Mrs Nelson-Stanley so scared
of the nuns finding it?

02:35.920 --> 02:38.480
Mum'll find a way of tricking them.

02:38.480 --> 02:41.280
Are you sure of that?
I mean, what if she doesn't?

02:41.280 --> 02:43.920
She's my mum.
She wouldn't let us down.

02:43.920 --> 02:47.000
She'll get us out of this.
All the same, we should be looking

02:47.000 --> 02:50.120
for a way of escaping,
not catching up on our reading.

02:50.120 --> 02:53.600
It's the history of the abbey.
Originally, it was a private house,

02:53.600 --> 02:55.720
built in the 16th century. Banging(!)

02:55.720 --> 02:59.040
It was during the Reformation,
when priests were being hunted.

02:59.040 --> 03:02.640
Look, I can get a history lesson
any time I want, off Mrs Pittman.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.680
Houses were built with
escape rooms and secret passages.

03:05.680 --> 03:07.160
Houses like this one.

03:24.040 --> 03:26.920
My scan indicates
Mr Jackson has undergone

03:26.920 --> 03:29.280
massive molecular transmutation.

03:29.280 --> 03:31.360
We know that.
He's been turned to stone.

03:31.360 --> 03:34.080
Not stone. Not strictly speaking.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.880
It's an organic
petrification process.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.600
Like fossilisation?

03:38.600 --> 03:40.240
It is comparable.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.480
And, to correct you again,
Sarah Jane,

03:42.480 --> 03:45.720
Mr Jackson hasn't turned
but is turning.

03:45.720 --> 03:49.280
The process isn't complete?
Could it be reversed? Theoretically.

03:49.280 --> 03:51.720
What does that mean?
It can be done.

03:51.720 --> 03:54.680
The molecular transmutation
isn't yet stable.

03:54.680 --> 03:57.120
But I don't know how to do it.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.200
Well, you've got to work it out!

03:59.200 --> 04:03.080
You've got to save my dad! I'm
not sure there is sufficient time.

04:03.080 --> 04:06.240
My scan suggests
molecular stabilisation

04:06.240 --> 04:08.920
will be complete
in approximately 90 minutes.

04:08.920 --> 04:12.200
There must be something you can do.
I can only be realistic.

04:12.200 --> 04:16.560
And to be candid, things look
worse for you all the time.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.519
Please, Mr Smith!
You've got to help us!

04:19.519 --> 04:23.080
Perhaps if I were more familiar
with the Gorgon...

04:23.080 --> 04:24.960
Bea! She might know something!

04:24.960 --> 04:29.000
She might. But Bea has Alzheimer's.
Her mind is trapped in the past.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.960
That's where she met the Gorgon!
We've only got till four o'clock.

04:32.960 --> 04:36.320
Like I said, there's always
a chance. Let's get going.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.600
I'm telling you,
I'd rather take my chances

04:51.600 --> 04:55.040
with the Gorgon than make like
a mole through any more tunnels.

04:55.040 --> 04:56.920
Whoa!

04:58.000 --> 05:00.680
Couldn't they get garden gnomes
like everyone else?

05:00.680 --> 05:04.040
It's killed all these people, then
put them on show like trophies.

05:04.040 --> 05:06.200
Or a warning, and I'm taking it.
Let's go!

05:09.200 --> 05:12.280
I'll have to leave you here
on your own.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.320
I really wish
I could help you, Maria,

05:14.320 --> 05:16.200
but I have to find
Luke and Clyde.

05:16.200 --> 05:19.680
Everything Bea knows about
the Gorgon is still inside her head.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.800
You just have to find a way
to unlock it.

05:21.800 --> 05:25.560
You were right. I never should
have got any of you involved.

05:25.560 --> 05:28.040
I'm sorry about what I said.
It's not your fault.

05:28.040 --> 05:30.520
I wanted to see aliens. Who wouldn't?

05:32.120 --> 05:34.640
If there's a way of saving your dad,
Maria,

05:34.640 --> 05:36.240
I know you're going to do it.

05:51.440 --> 05:53.160
We have the key.

05:53.160 --> 05:57.520
Rejoice, Sisters!
The Gorgons shall be free!

06:01.240 --> 06:04.400
Mother Abbess! She is weakening.

06:04.400 --> 06:07.320
We must open the portal
as soon as possible.

06:09.360 --> 06:12.560
Now, while the coast is clear!
I can't. What you talking about?

06:12.560 --> 06:16.200
I promised Mrs Nelson-Stanley I
wouldn't let them take the talisman.

06:16.200 --> 06:19.640
I've let her down. Did she tell you
you'd be going up against a Gorgon

06:19.640 --> 06:22.600
and you might end up
a garden ornament? No, but...

06:22.600 --> 06:25.520
This goes way beyond
the call of duty.

06:25.520 --> 06:30.800
Mum wouldn't give them the talisman
unless something had happened. What?

06:30.800 --> 06:34.240
That thing? Sarah Jane and Maria?
I'm not going to let the Gorgon win.

06:34.240 --> 06:35.480
But I need your help.

06:37.240 --> 06:39.240
KNOCK ON DOOR
Come in.

06:41.600 --> 06:44.560
Bea?

06:44.560 --> 06:49.080
Hello, it's Maria.
Do you remember me? Hello, darling.

06:49.080 --> 06:51.680
You're a little young, aren't you?

06:51.680 --> 06:56.560
Young? To be the curator of
the Museum of Egyptology.

07:01.440 --> 07:05.120
Serve the Gorgon! Serve the Gorgon!

07:05.120 --> 07:07.680
Behold...the key to the portal.

07:07.680 --> 07:11.160
After 3,000 years, our work here
comes to an end

07:11.160 --> 07:15.280
and our world
is on the threshold of a new age.

07:17.200 --> 07:21.440
The Gorgon world is
100 million light years away,

07:21.440 --> 07:24.600
and the angle of ascension
must be aligned perfectly.

07:26.560 --> 07:28.840
Transdimensional
occlusion is forming.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.480
Alignment is at 20 per cent.

07:32.880 --> 07:36.760
Only an hour before the portal opens
and your people shall join you.

07:36.760 --> 07:41.640
After all these centuries, Gorgons
shall have their promised land.

07:41.640 --> 07:44.600
The time grows short.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.120
The host is dying.

07:47.120 --> 07:50.000
We need to find a new carrier
before the portal opens.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.160
Bea?

07:52.200 --> 07:53.880
Bea, please help me.

07:53.880 --> 07:57.400
MUSIC PLAYS ON RECORD PLAYER
You have to tell me about the Gorgon.

07:57.400 --> 08:01.600
Edgar and I danced to this
in the palace...

08:02.680 --> 08:07.640
In the palace of the Sultan of
Ishkanbah. Do you know him? No.

08:07.640 --> 08:09.840
I've never even heard of...

08:09.840 --> 08:14.200
Bea, the Gorgon has turned my dad
into stone, and if you don't help me,

08:14.200 --> 08:18.800
I'll never get him back. Understand?
The Sultan was a fascinating man.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.080
He had seen the Yeti, you know?

08:21.080 --> 08:24.120
Tell me.
Tell me about the things you've seen.

08:24.120 --> 08:28.080
I've seen all kinds of things with
Sarah Jane. Do I know Sarah Jane?

08:28.080 --> 08:30.520
It's silly, I know,
but I keep forgetting.

08:30.520 --> 08:33.039
Sarah Jane has seen loads
of aliens and monsters

08:33.039 --> 08:35.200
on Earth, even other planets.

08:35.200 --> 08:40.720
She's had hundreds of adventures,
just like you and Edgar did.

08:40.720 --> 08:41.760
Edgar...

09:03.600 --> 09:07.560
If only I could hear his voice
again, just once.

09:07.560 --> 09:12.000
We had adventures once.
Such adventures!

09:13.680 --> 09:16.280
But no-one believes me now.

09:17.880 --> 09:20.160
No-one listens to you
when you're old.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.360
I believe you, Bea!

09:23.560 --> 09:24.560
Bea!

09:44.600 --> 09:46.840
DOORBELL RINGS

09:46.840 --> 09:49.520
Maria? Are you in there?

09:49.520 --> 09:50.960
Alan?

10:10.560 --> 10:12.040
The woman's obsessed!

10:19.000 --> 10:21.960
She really is a bunny boiler,
this one.

10:21.960 --> 10:27.080
Couldn't have the real thing,
so she's made herself a statue!

10:27.080 --> 10:30.360
I bet you'd be flattered
if you knew, wouldn't you?

10:30.360 --> 10:33.000
You didn't know, did you?

10:35.040 --> 10:37.480
So it's come to this, has it?

10:37.480 --> 10:41.600
Talking to a flaming statue
instead of the real thing.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.760
Maybe her and me
aren't so different.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.520
Both have to make do
with what we can.

10:49.400 --> 10:53.040
Difference is, she doesn't know
what she's missing, does she?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.760
Still, you're all right.
Anyone can see that.

10:56.760 --> 10:59.040
You and Maria get along great.

10:59.040 --> 11:02.920
Better off without me around
messing things up.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.080
Well, like I said,

11:05.080 --> 11:08.720
I can make do till
I mess things up again, which...

11:08.720 --> 11:11.400
I will, cos I'm me, aren't I?

11:14.680 --> 11:17.880
Anyway, er,
been nice talking to you.

11:34.440 --> 11:39.040
Alignment is at 45 per cent. Good.

11:39.040 --> 11:42.560
Her strength is failing.
Soon we will select a new host.

11:42.560 --> 11:45.400
Soon the Gorgons and humanity
will be one.

11:50.160 --> 11:53.960
All right, Quasimodo,
time to do your thing.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.800
BELL CLANGS LOUDLY

11:59.800 --> 12:02.520
What on earth...?

12:03.640 --> 12:05.920
Find out what's going on!

12:19.440 --> 12:20.840
Stop him!

12:30.960 --> 12:34.200
Serve the Gorgon! Serve the Gorgon!
Have you got it?

12:34.200 --> 12:36.680
There's loads of them!
They're everywhere!

12:36.680 --> 12:39.160
Serve the Gorgon! Serve the Gorgon!

12:39.160 --> 12:40.400
Boys, quick! This way!

12:40.400 --> 12:43.640
Serve the Gorgon! Serve the Gorgon!

12:43.640 --> 12:48.120
Serve the Gorgon! Serve the Gorgon!

12:48.120 --> 12:51.760
Serve the Gorgon! Serve the Gorgon!

12:51.760 --> 12:55.960
Serve the Gorgon! Serve the Gorgon!

12:55.960 --> 12:59.680
Serve the Gorgon! Serve the Gorgon!

12:59.680 --> 13:01.560
Serve the Gorgon!

13:04.960 --> 13:08.560
I bet your lipstick thing would
have had this licked, no problem.

13:08.560 --> 13:11.400
Shame the nuns made me
check my bag in at the door.

13:11.400 --> 13:14.320
I hope Maria's having better luck
with Mrs Nelson-Stanley.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.560
We don't need any Star Trek gadgets.

13:16.560 --> 13:19.000
This place is full
of secret passages.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.720
Luke read all about it. He's got it
all filed in that superbrain of his.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.320
I don't remember any down here.

13:24.320 --> 13:27.160
Yeah, well, all the same,
it's worth trying.

13:27.160 --> 13:29.000
Mum. Hm?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.160
I think the Gorgon's dying.

13:31.160 --> 13:34.560
Why? We saw her stumble earlier,
like she was sick.

13:34.560 --> 13:37.800
I heard Sister Helena saying
they needed to find a new host.

13:37.800 --> 13:41.520
She said when the portal's open,
humanity and the Gorgon will be one.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.560
That's what she meant!

13:43.560 --> 13:46.640
At the house, when she took
the talisman, Helena said

13:46.640 --> 13:48.640
the Gorgons needed us to survive.

13:48.640 --> 13:51.880
I don't think the Abbess
is the Gorgon. What?

13:52.880 --> 13:56.080
Miss Smith, will you come with us?

13:57.680 --> 14:00.000
I'll be fine.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Don't worry, boys,
we won't harm a hair on her head.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.720
We've got to find a way out of here.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.800
Sarah Jane was right, wasn't she?

14:18.800 --> 14:23.120
I thought meeting creatures from
other planets was exciting and cool.

14:23.120 --> 14:27.000
But she told me. She said
it wasn't anything like that.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.960
In the end, it just messes you up,

14:29.960 --> 14:33.760
your whole life
and the people you love.

14:33.760 --> 14:36.280
That's why Sarah Jane's
always been on her own.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.680
That's why you're here,
isn't it, Bea?

14:40.680 --> 14:44.880
With no-one in the world
who really knows you, or cares.

14:44.880 --> 14:46.600
This is how we all end up, isn't it?

14:51.080 --> 14:52.960
I had my Edgar.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.720
You are young, you'll find yours.

14:57.280 --> 14:59.840
Bea? Are you really there?

14:59.840 --> 15:01.400
Where else would I be?

15:01.400 --> 15:02.920
I haven't got much time.

15:02.920 --> 15:07.120
The Gorgon turned my father to stone.
Can we save him? Your father?

15:07.120 --> 15:10.680
Oh, dear. Oh, deary-dear.
That's most unpleasant.

15:10.680 --> 15:12.640
I should know, it happened to me.

15:12.640 --> 15:17.240
It turned you into stone?
The nuns were after the talisman.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.680
But Edgar saved you.
He must have. How?

15:19.680 --> 15:20.720
The talisman.

15:20.720 --> 15:23.640
It is the key to the door
between this world and theirs.

15:23.640 --> 15:28.120
But it's more.
It returned me to flesh and blood.

15:28.120 --> 15:31.120
The talisman. The Gorgon's got it.

15:31.120 --> 15:33.360
Then you must get it back.

15:33.360 --> 15:37.280
Not only for your father,
but for every soul on Earth!

15:37.280 --> 15:38.880
Thank you, Bea.

15:41.280 --> 15:43.720
Not so fast, young lady.
Would you...er...

15:43.720 --> 15:46.480
fetch me...my mirror?

15:49.000 --> 15:50.680
No, not for me!

15:50.680 --> 15:54.120
So I can powder my nose while you
take on that monster? It's for you!

15:54.120 --> 15:56.600
For me?

15:57.680 --> 16:00.200
Whatever do they teach you

16:03.440 --> 16:06.720
What makes you think the Gorgons
will still want to invade?

16:06.720 --> 16:08.920
3,000 years is a long time.

16:08.920 --> 16:12.920
Not for the Gorgons.
Without host bodies to carry them?

16:12.920 --> 16:15.320
The Gorgons are parasites,
aren't they?

16:15.320 --> 16:18.720
"Parasite"...
It's such an unattractive word.

16:18.720 --> 16:21.640
It's what they are,
a life-form that lives on another,

16:21.640 --> 16:24.240
that depends on another
to feed and survive.

16:24.240 --> 16:27.760
The Gorgon gives its host
life beyond human years.

16:27.760 --> 16:31.600
The Abbess has carried the Gorgon
for 200 years,

16:31.600 --> 16:36.040
although there have been many hosts,
and now she grows weak.

16:36.040 --> 16:40.120
Her time is coming, and the Gorgons
have chosen a new host

16:40.120 --> 16:42.400
to lead its domination of Earth.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.840
You, Miss Smith.

16:58.640 --> 17:00.280
You're going to dig a tunnel?

17:00.280 --> 17:02.280
No. I'm going to make a screwdriver.

17:02.280 --> 17:03.760
The old-fashioned way.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.520
Not long now, Miss Smith.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.520
As the Abbess weakens more,

17:10.520 --> 17:13.200
the Gorgon will release
its hold on her

17:13.200 --> 17:17.839
and you will become leader
of a new race ruling planet Earth.

17:17.839 --> 17:19.480
You can do what you want to me,

17:19.480 --> 17:23.280
but this planet will never
bow down to that THING.

17:38.880 --> 17:42.640
We need a plan. Yeah, sure. When we
get a chance, we'll figure one out.

17:42.640 --> 17:44.560
Meantime,
we need to find Sarah Jane.

17:46.360 --> 17:49.080
The portal is opening.
The Gorgons are coming.

17:49.080 --> 17:51.560
The new Queen must
be ready to meet them.

17:51.560 --> 17:54.080
Bring the host forward.

17:54.080 --> 17:59.000
Don't struggle, Miss Smith.
Embrace your destiny!

17:59.000 --> 18:03.080
The Gorgon is controlling all
of you! You've got to fight it!

18:03.080 --> 18:05.960
If not, they'll destroy
the human race.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.560
No! The Gorgons shall save us!

18:07.560 --> 18:12.880
From war, from greed.
We will exist only to serve them.

18:12.880 --> 18:17.720
We will be at peace everlasting.
And you shall be our Queen!

18:20.600 --> 18:23.960
To receive the Gorgon, do not
look into its eyes, Miss Smith.

18:23.960 --> 18:27.600
To do so will turn you to stone.

18:27.600 --> 18:31.320
I'd rather be a lump of granite
than bow down to that thing!

18:31.320 --> 18:37.800
You don't have a choice, Miss Smith.
Prepare to serve the Gorgon!

18:37.800 --> 18:40.040
NUNS: Serve the Gorgon!

18:40.040 --> 18:42.440
Serve the Gorgon! Serve the Gorgon!

18:42.440 --> 18:45.120
Serve the Gorgon! Serve the Gorgon!

18:45.120 --> 18:47.040
Mum! Luke!

18:47.920 --> 18:50.480
Hold them.
They can witness the transfer

18:50.480 --> 18:52.400
and be the new Queen's first prey.

18:52.400 --> 18:53.840
No! No!

19:24.600 --> 19:26.760
Where am I? What's going on?

19:28.000 --> 19:31.720
You're free. The Gorgon's
lost its control over you.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.280
They're coming through!

19:42.480 --> 19:44.400
Come on, Maria!

19:52.400 --> 19:54.120
What about your father?

19:55.440 --> 19:56.840
Come on!

20:03.000 --> 20:07.520
What if it doesn't work? If it saved
Bea, it'll save your father. Quick!

20:35.440 --> 20:36.920
Dad!

20:39.000 --> 20:40.640
He's alive.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.560
He's just unconscious.

20:42.560 --> 20:45.840
Quickly, we have to get him
out of here before he comes round.

21:04.560 --> 21:08.760
Where the heck have you been?
I've been looking for you for ages!

21:08.760 --> 21:10.120
I went looking for Maria,

21:10.120 --> 21:14.520
then I must have sat down in
Sarah Jane's garden and dozed off.

21:14.520 --> 21:19.840
Another of the disappearing
Jacksons! I'm sorry about earlier.

21:19.840 --> 21:22.800
No, Dad, I'm really sorry,
I shouldn't have yelled

21:22.800 --> 21:29.560
or run off like that. It was stupid.
I could have lost you for ever.

21:29.560 --> 21:32.000
You're never going to lose me.

21:32.000 --> 21:37.040
Do you know what that woman has
in her lounge? It's shocking. What?

21:37.040 --> 21:38.880
A statue of Dad.

21:38.880 --> 21:41.960
A statue of me? But why?
Because she's a nutter.

21:41.960 --> 21:43.560
Mum, there isn't a statue.

21:43.560 --> 21:45.080
There is!

21:46.080 --> 21:49.760
What, er, what exactly was it
you were looking for, Mrs Jackson?

21:51.280 --> 21:52.720
What have you done with it?

21:52.720 --> 21:55.640
It was right here, bold as you like,
a statue of my Alan.

21:55.640 --> 21:58.560
Mrs Jackson,
I don't know what you're...

21:58.560 --> 22:00.560
I know what I saw. Where is it?

22:00.560 --> 22:04.080
Er, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

22:07.400 --> 22:08.560
Come on, Mum.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.360
Maybe we should go home, hmm?

22:13.200 --> 22:17.360
Pity, really. I think I'd look good
as one of those Greek statues.

22:18.960 --> 22:20.960
I prefer you the way you are.

22:27.120 --> 22:31.560
Oh, sorry I couldn't stay, love,
but Ivan was in floods on the phone.

22:31.560 --> 22:33.000
It's OK. I understand.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.680
I know we're not under
the same roof, darling, but...

22:35.680 --> 22:38.440
I'm always there for you
if you need me.

22:38.440 --> 22:41.600
I'll always be here for you.
OK? Always.

22:44.640 --> 22:48.360
I wasn't seeing things, y'know.
I know what I saw over there.

22:48.360 --> 22:50.760
Listen to your mum.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.680
Stay away from that Mary Jane.

22:52.680 --> 22:56.240
There's something not quite right
about her. Meter's running.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.360
Mum's back with Ivan.

23:18.360 --> 23:20.200
So it's just me and Dad again.

23:24.480 --> 23:27.000
If the talisman was the key
to the portal,

23:27.000 --> 23:28.960
how could it turn my dad back?

23:28.960 --> 23:31.360
All matter has an atomic default.

23:31.360 --> 23:35.040
Some alien technology uses this
default to turn things on and off.

23:35.040 --> 23:38.200
Such technology can
reverse cellular distortion.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.360
It can make things
the way they used to be?

23:40.360 --> 23:42.160
Most fortunately for you.

23:42.160 --> 23:43.840
So maybe it could help Bea.

23:43.840 --> 23:46.240
Oh, Maria, I don't know.
Bea has Alzheimer's.

23:46.240 --> 23:49.440
Besides, she had the talisman
all that time.

23:49.440 --> 23:53.640
Luke said it was in a tin box. Maybe
she hasn't touched it for years.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.560
Oh, I don't know, Maria.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.440
But she helped save my dad.

23:57.440 --> 24:00.440
If it could change him
back from stone...

24:00.440 --> 24:02.520
Please, we have to try.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.080
BEA HUMS TO HERSELF

24:28.200 --> 24:30.120
Hello, Bea.

24:30.120 --> 24:33.360
It's Maria.

24:33.360 --> 24:37.760
I've got something
that belongs to you.

24:37.760 --> 24:40.560
Is it my compact?
I'm always leaving it lying about.

24:40.560 --> 24:43.000
Edgar says I'll lose my head
one of these days.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
No. It's something Edgar gave you.

24:48.440 --> 24:50.960
Oh, no, you must put it back
where I hid it.

24:50.960 --> 24:53.920
You must put it back in case
they come... It's all right.

24:53.920 --> 24:58.920
They'll never come looking for it
again. The Gorgon is dead.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.320
Everything is going to be all right.

25:03.320 --> 25:04.520
Is it true?

25:13.400 --> 25:16.560
Edgar gave it to me,
you know. I know.

25:16.560 --> 25:21.600
But he's been gone for so long. I've
always been scared to wear this.

25:21.600 --> 25:24.920
Oh, it's so beautiful.

25:24.920 --> 25:30.960
You know, he put this round my neck

25:30.960 --> 25:35.360
and he kissed me for the first time

25:35.360 --> 25:37.760
and told me that he loved me.

25:49.440 --> 25:52.560
MAN'S VOICE WHISPERS:
'I will always love you, Bea.'

25:53.880 --> 25:54.840
Oh...

25:56.960 --> 25:57.960
Edgar.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.480
Thank you
for bringing him back to me.

26:05.240 --> 26:08.360
You shouldn't be upset.
The talisman didn't cure Bea,

26:08.360 --> 26:11.280
but it did something amazing
all the same.

26:11.280 --> 26:13.560
It gave her peace.

26:13.560 --> 26:15.680
She was lucky to have Edgar,
wasn't she?

26:15.680 --> 26:17.640
I suppose she was.

26:17.640 --> 26:21.080
Don't you wish you had found
someone special to share it all with?

26:21.080 --> 26:22.960
Oh, I think I have.

26:22.960 --> 26:24.920
For the second time.

26:25.920 --> 26:28.080
Now, let's get back.

26:28.080 --> 26:31.720
The Viszeran Royal Fleet are passing
through the solar system tonight,

26:31.720 --> 26:32.960
all 600 ships.

26:32.960 --> 26:34.320
Only takes a few seconds,

26:34.320 --> 26:37.480
but it is the most magnificent
stellar light show

26:37.480 --> 26:39.000
this side of the galaxy.

26:55.920 --> 26:58.240
Have all these kids
really gone missing?

26:58.240 --> 27:02.920
We run a special competition
for the more skilled competitors.

27:04.440 --> 27:08.080
This is wicked. It's like
Premier League for laser tag.

27:08.080 --> 27:10.280
Are you man enough to have a go?

27:10.280 --> 27:13.360
Soon we shall have
the children you need.

27:13.360 --> 27:16.960
24 children have disappeared in
cities where there's a Combat 3000.

27:16.960 --> 27:20.840
The ultimate warrior of the future

27:20.840 --> 27:23.320
is always on guard
for a surprise attack.

27:23.320 --> 27:24.920
Perhaps I can help.

27:24.920 --> 27:26.040
Goodbye, Miss Smith.
