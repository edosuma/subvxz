WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.080
Let's get the bastard.

00:03.080 --> 00:04.600
Going to need you to do
something for me.

00:04.600 --> 00:05.680
Something not very nice.

00:05.680 --> 00:07.280
Chuck us your phone, I'll stick me
number in.

00:07.280 --> 00:08.400
Put it in as James, yeah?

00:08.400 --> 00:10.200
I made a friend from group.

00:10.200 --> 00:12.280
Oi, are you not worried?

00:12.280 --> 00:14.240
You can carry on working for Col
or you can quit.

00:14.240 --> 00:15.960
Those are the two people that

00:15.960 --> 00:17.440
you get to be, so choose.

00:17.440 --> 00:20.760
Anything that puts Owen at harm's
way, I'll leave.

00:20.760 --> 00:23.840
What if I can get the Maliks
out the way for you?

00:23.840 --> 00:26.280
Phone us in a tip-off, I hard stop
them.

00:26.280 --> 00:28.040
You put the gear in the Maliks' car.

00:28.040 --> 00:29.120
Why?

00:29.120 --> 00:31.000
Cos I work for Col McHugh.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.040
I always have.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.960
You going to say something?

01:20.920 --> 01:23.760
I don't always know what to say,
I'm not like you.

01:30.640 --> 01:33.200
How did you end up working for him?

01:33.200 --> 01:34.440
Don't matter.

01:35.920 --> 01:38.040
I am where I am.

01:43.640 --> 01:46.480
I wanted to be you.

01:46.480 --> 01:47.920
When I was starting out, me friends

01:47.920 --> 01:49.320
would say, "What you doing, Est?"

01:49.320 --> 01:50.840
And I said, "No, you don't get it.

01:50.840 --> 01:52.920
"There's this DI, she's killing
it."

01:54.640 --> 01:56.680
And the whole time, you were on the
take.

01:56.680 --> 01:57.920
It's not like that.

01:57.920 --> 02:00.080
What is it like, then?

02:00.080 --> 02:02.280
It weren't a one-way street.

02:02.280 --> 02:04.480
He gave me a lot of intel.

02:04.480 --> 02:07.440
Most of my big cases turned on
something he gave me.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.680
If it's so mutual, why does he have
to pay you?

02:12.680 --> 02:14.240
Oh, look, does it matter?

02:14.240 --> 02:15.920
It's over, I'm out.

02:15.920 --> 02:17.800
Since I caught you this morning?

02:17.800 --> 02:20.720
No, since before that.

02:20.720 --> 02:23.000
I'm telling you, it's over.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.600
I'm going to bring him in but it
has to be my way.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.080
And he cannot know.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.440
No, don't do that.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.800
Don't treat me like I'm an idiot,
you know I'm not.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.680
No, I know, I know how it sounds

02:33.680 --> 02:35.360
but I promise you I'm not lying.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.920
It's over, Esther.

02:41.160 --> 02:43.560
You know I have to tell Sandy.

02:43.560 --> 02:45.800
Grass?  Don't you dare.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.760
OK, I won't tell her.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.480
If you do tell her yourself, it's
the best way.

02:56.480 --> 02:57.880
I can't.

02:57.880 --> 03:00.480
If I betray him, he will come for
me, for me family.

03:00.480 --> 03:03.240
Not if he's inside.

03:03.240 --> 03:06.480
Well, I'm sorry, if you don't,
I have to.

03:06.480 --> 03:09.400
Please, let me make this right.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.560
Let me finish what I have started
here.

03:11.560 --> 03:13.560
Well, finish what? You've done what
you've done.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.720
I won't lie for you, I can't, it's
wrong.

03:15.720 --> 03:18.760
Oh, it's as simple as that, is it?
Yeah...

03:18.760 --> 03:20.640
..it is.

03:23.920 --> 03:26.000
You're a good copper.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.400
How would you know?

03:47.160 --> 03:49.640
Lou, what you doing?
You're going to wake Owen.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.080
Lou?

03:54.680 --> 03:55.920
What's happened?  It's over.

03:55.920 --> 03:58.080
We have to get all of this out of
the house.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.400
What do you mean, over?

03:59.400 --> 04:01.360
Esther caught me doing something for
Col

04:01.360 --> 04:03.840
and she's going to Sandy.

04:03.840 --> 04:07.360
They're going to search the house,
so we have to get rid of everything.

04:08.520 --> 04:09.760
What'll happen?

04:09.760 --> 04:11.520
Erm, well, I'll deny everything.

04:11.520 --> 04:14.680
Cos I can't co-operate, Col would
find out.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.760
Well, I'll take it all.

04:16.760 --> 04:18.760
I'll burn it if I have to.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.440
So it is over, then?

04:32.440 --> 04:34.960
I'm no use to Col if I get caught,
am I?

04:37.320 --> 04:38.920
So resign.

04:38.920 --> 04:41.120
Do it tomorrow...

04:41.120 --> 04:42.640
..before anything happens.

04:42.640 --> 04:44.440
You were going to anyway.

04:44.440 --> 04:45.960
I know it's not the end that you

04:45.960 --> 04:47.680
wanted, but it's an end.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.880
This is the best we could've hoped
for.

04:49.880 --> 04:51.840
Is it?  Yeah.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.360
You know, nothing else matters.

04:54.360 --> 04:55.920
None of it's your problem.

04:58.040 --> 05:00.440
We'll be free.

05:00.440 --> 05:01.680
Yeah?

05:05.360 --> 05:08.280
After all this, we get to walk away.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.240
Come on, come down.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.560
I'll sort the money later.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.280
How you feeling?

05:40.280 --> 05:41.880
Condemned.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.840
You've just got to get through
this part.  Mm-hm.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.520
There you go.

06:25.520 --> 06:27.160

it's  not what you think.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.840
You're going to want to hear this.

What are you playing at?

I need to talk to you.

Jesus Christ, not here.

Col, you have to let me in!

08:38.720 --> 08:40.280
Listen to me, we've got no time.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.720
I've just come from the station and

08:41.720 --> 08:43.400
I've seen something I weren't meant
to.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.840
There's a taskforce, you're the
target.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.280
I'm not on it, they have
deliberately kept me from it.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.840
They know about us.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.520
They have to. Why else would they
freeze me out?

08:52.520 --> 08:56.120
Right.  No,  don't. They could've
turned someone.

08:56.120 --> 08:57.520
Right. What do they have?

08:57.520 --> 08:59.720
I don't know. But enough for a
warrant to search the house.

08:59.720 --> 09:01.280
When?  No idea.

09:01.280 --> 09:02.600
I came as soon as I saw. They could

09:02.600 --> 09:04.400
be on their way to you right now,
for all I know.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.160
You need to clear-out the house out
now.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.680
Well, you know I don't keep anything

09:09.680 --> 09:11.080
in the house, you know that.

09:11.080 --> 09:13.000
What's in your safe? Just your
cufflinks?

09:15.680 --> 09:17.760
Everything's encrypted.

09:17.760 --> 09:20.720
You want to take that chance?

09:20.720 --> 09:23.680
Be sure and clear-out the house and
do it now.

I won't be a minute, DC Okoye,

I just need to send this.

Esther, are you there?

10:46.520 --> 10:48.200
You can't change my mind.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.520
No, this, this isn't about last

10:49.520 --> 10:52.000
night, this is about Col McHugh.
Do you want to bring him in?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.320
I'm not playing your games, Lou.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.640
No, this ain't a game.

10:54.640 --> 10:56.760
He's leaving his house to dispose of
evidence,

10:56.760 --> 10:58.560
stuff you could use to nail him.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.360
Well, why don't you bring him in?

11:00.360 --> 11:01.800
You know I can't.

11:01.800 --> 11:04.280
You just say it's from a source
and we'll deal with it later.

11:07.040 --> 11:09.120
Where is he?

11:09.120 --> 11:10.600
He hasn't come out yet.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.360
Well, what exactly is he carrying?

11:12.360 --> 11:16.240
I'm pretty sure it's computer stuff,
like hard drives.

11:31.960 --> 11:34.000
I'm parked-up half a mile from his
house.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
There's only one road that
goes in or out.

11:37.120 --> 11:38.640
I'm betting he's leaving soon

11:38.640 --> 11:40.120
and I'm betting he's carrying summat

11:40.120 --> 11:42.200

him down.

11:44.840 --> 11:46.760
You want me to trust you?

Look, if I'm wrong, all that happens
is you look daft.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.240
But if I'm right, you get to bring
down Col McHugh today.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.880
We'll decide what to do about me
later.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.200
Esther, you're only going to get one
chance at this.

Get over here now!

Esther?

12:21.360 --> 12:23.840
Sorry, Ma'am. It were a source.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.840
OK. Do you want to have that chat?

12:25.840 --> 12:28.280
Erm, it's nothing, it'll wait.

I really need to chase this up.

12:32.240 --> 12:35.000
It could be relevant to the

Fine.

Off you go.

Not yet.

Oh, come on.

Everything by the book from here on
out.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.640

Supposedly, he's moving some
incriminating evidence,

14:26.640 --> 14:27.880
she's had some intel.

14:27.880 --> 14:29.400
You're kidding. Is she on her own?

At the moment, yeah.

14:30.960 --> 14:32.400
We're getting units out to her.

Yes, Ma'am.

He's barely pushing the speed limit.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.640
Proper careful.

you may be carrying stolen

Erm, Mr McHugh...

which could lead to your arrest.

16:55.560 --> 16:58.200
You will be entitled to a copy of
the search record.

16:58.200 --> 16:59.680
I'll give you a reference number.

17:01.960 --> 17:03.880
Ma'am.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.320
May I look inside your bag, please?

17:17.320 --> 17:19.600
Could you open it for me, please?

18:00.440 --> 18:02.000
SANDY:  What is it?

18:03.120 --> 18:04.480
It's um...

18:05.520 --> 18:06.760
..nothing.

18:07.960 --> 18:09.560
What do you mean, "nothing"?

18:09.560 --> 18:11.280
It's just...

18:11.280 --> 18:14.760
..office stuff, some printer paper.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.560
Packs of Post-It notes.

18:16.560 --> 18:19.360
Post-Its?  Is he messing with us?

18:36.720 --> 18:39.400
Don't worry about the reference
number, hmm.

18:46.760 --> 18:48.440
DOORBELL RINGS

18:57.920 --> 18:59.760
Busy?

19:16.920 --> 19:19.680
You sure I shouldn't have me chair?

19:19.680 --> 19:21.760
No, you won't need it.

19:25.520 --> 19:27.880
You won't need that, either.

19:27.880 --> 19:29.920
No phones today.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.640
They only tell you what to do.

19:31.640 --> 19:35.440
Leave it. Me and you are going
off grid, bro.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.120
I can't leave it.

19:37.120 --> 19:38.560
My parents would freak.

19:38.560 --> 19:40.400
What are you, ten?

19:42.200 --> 19:43.800
I can turn it off.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.680
Done.

19:51.680 --> 19:53.560
Go on, then.

19:53.560 --> 19:57.120
Come on then, bro, let's go on your
big adventure.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.680
Better not be shit, though.

Hello?

20:10.440 --> 20:12.400
OK, old voicemail joke.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.440
But admit it, I got you.

20:14.440 --> 20:16.080
It's Owen, leave a message.

20:17.720 --> 20:19.400
Tell them to get a wriggle on,
yeah?

20:19.400 --> 20:20.960
We're going to lift by Monday.

20:20.960 --> 20:22.520
All right, I'll be two minutes.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.360
OK, guys, we need to speed up, yeah?

20:26.000 --> 20:27.640
See you.

LOU: Ceri, I'm  so sorry.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.760
I tried to set Col up and he knows,

20:44.760 --> 20:46.400
so don't come home.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.000
He might have people watching the
house.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.880
I'm going to find Owen, I'm going to
sort it.

20:49.880 --> 20:52.280
I'm so sorry.
It'll be OK.

21:16.320 --> 21:17.760
Owen?

21:22.040 --> 21:24.200
Owen, are you here, love?

21:54.760 --> 21:56.160
OWEN ON VOICEMAIL:  Hello?

21:56.160 --> 21:57.560
Owen, Owen, love.

21:57.560 --> 21:59.960
Hello? OK, old voicemail joke.

21:59.960 --> 22:02.240
But admit it, I got you.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.360
It's Owen, leave a message.

22:04.360 --> 22:05.920
Owen, love, you've got to call me

22:05.920 --> 22:09.040
back, it's important, OK? As soon
as.

22:09.040 --> 22:11.000
I love you. Bye.

Your lad's safe - for now.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.320
I don't believe you.

22:56.320 --> 22:58.240
Yeah, you do.

22:58.240 --> 22:59.640
The farm.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.280
Half an hour.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.760
Alone...

23:02.760 --> 23:04.520
..or we drown him.

23:21.760 --> 23:23.160
What's up with you?

23:23.160 --> 23:25.400
I thought you said it wasn't far?
It's not.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.240
I use the chair for a reason.

23:31.520 --> 23:33.080
Where are we going?

23:33.080 --> 23:34.880
A bit further down here.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.280
We'll be well away, trust me,

23:36.280 --> 23:38.520
it's worth it.  All right.

23:38.520 --> 23:40.200
Give us a drag of that.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.400
Here you are.

23:42.400 --> 23:44.600
Nice one, mate.  It's all right.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.320
Come on, you coward! Open the gate!

24:05.320 --> 24:08.160
Come on! Come out!

24:12.040 --> 24:13.800
What's the matter with you?

24:13.800 --> 24:15.120
You really want to be seen here?

24:15.120 --> 24:16.680
Is she in there?

24:16.680 --> 24:17.760
Lou?

24:17.760 --> 24:19.200
No, of course not.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.400
If he hurts her, Alma,
I'll kill him.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.200
You'll do nothing. I don't know

24:24.200 --> 24:25.640
where Col is, he doesn't tell me.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.320
So get back in your truck.

24:27.320 --> 24:28.840
You came, you shouted, you can tell

24:28.840 --> 24:31.280
yourself you did something, maybe it
helps you.

24:49.640 --> 24:51.120
Told you it were good.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.200
You don't like it?

24:56.200 --> 24:57.240
I do.

24:58.280 --> 25:01.840
Bit of a weird place for your dad
to take a little kid, though.

25:01.840 --> 25:03.200
Yeah!

25:03.200 --> 25:05.720
But I were a proper mentalist.

25:05.720 --> 25:09.000
Tasmanian Devil, he used to call me.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.560
And sometimes it'd get so bad, he'd

25:11.560 --> 25:13.520
just chuck us in car and take us

25:13.520 --> 25:15.280
somewhere far away from anyone.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.920
Let me run wild.

25:19.520 --> 25:22.120
Funny thing is though...

25:22.120 --> 25:25.400
..whenever he brought me here...

25:25.400 --> 25:27.200
..I'd just be chill.

25:34.080 --> 25:36.680
I'm not, erm...

25:37.720 --> 25:39.440
I think I knew.

25:39.440 --> 25:40.840
It's OK.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.200
Don't feel embarrassed.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.360
Why would I be embarrassed?

PHONE PINGS

25:51.600 --> 25:53.520

25:53.520 --> 25:55.280

25:59.600 --> 26:01.160
It's excruciatingly obvious that

26:01.160 --> 26:04.200
it's your girlfriend, which is
completely fine.

26:05.920 --> 26:08.920
Did you think I thought someone
like you could be miraculously

26:08.920 --> 26:10.920
walking the Earth unattached?

26:15.400 --> 26:17.800
What were that?

26:17.800 --> 26:19.600
You want to capture the exquisite

26:19.600 --> 26:21.480
awkwardness of this moment forever?

26:23.200 --> 26:25.280
Don't know.

26:25.280 --> 26:27.120
Summat people do.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.440

You  see it, Slack?

27:48.960 --> 27:51.160
Where's Owen?

27:51.160 --> 27:52.880
What have you done with him?

27:52.880 --> 27:55.640
Col, where is my son?

27:55.640 --> 27:58.120
You tried to set me up this morning.

27:58.120 --> 28:00.720
You've been working against me
for a wee while now.

28:04.440 --> 28:07.440
Has Owen ever shown you a picture of
his wee friend James?

28:11.520 --> 28:13.240
That's him.

28:15.600 --> 28:18.880
Apparently, you and Ceri have been
arguing for years now about a man.

28:23.520 --> 28:25.600
Owen doesn't know his name but...

28:25.600 --> 28:27.200
..recently you've been talking

28:27.200 --> 28:29.840
about stabbing him in the back,
getting rid of him.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.000
He, he doesn't know.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.520
He thinks he's having a nice
day out with his,

28:36.520 --> 28:39.160
with his pal down by the water.

28:39.160 --> 28:40.960
Please, Col.

28:40.960 --> 28:43.560
Maybe that doesn't have to change.
Maybe he doesn't have to get hurt.

28:45.360 --> 28:47.400
So long as we don't have any more
lies.

28:47.400 --> 28:49.760
I have no more to tell.
No, good, good.

28:49.760 --> 28:51.200
So, why?

28:54.840 --> 28:57.480
I wanted to bring you down.

28:57.480 --> 28:59.120
Really?

29:01.680 --> 29:03.640
I see. And why is that?

29:07.760 --> 29:09.080
I can't explain it.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.720
Well, try and do better.

29:10.720 --> 29:12.080
OK.

29:13.320 --> 29:15.840
The night that we nearly
lost Owen...

29:16.800 --> 29:18.680
..I asked for him to be saved.

29:18.680 --> 29:20.280
And then he was saved.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.160
And when I went back to work...

29:22.160 --> 29:24.080
..I realised that my part of the

29:24.080 --> 29:26.280
deal was stopping you.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.040
Why?

29:31.000 --> 29:32.520
Because it's wrong.

29:32.520 --> 29:33.920
Oh, ha-ha.

29:33.920 --> 29:36.120
You  hear that, Bulge?

29:36.120 --> 29:37.680
"Because it's wrong."

29:37.680 --> 29:39.440
Has this only just occurred?

29:39.440 --> 29:41.520
Yeah.

29:41.520 --> 29:43.600
Oh, no.

29:43.600 --> 29:45.800
Oh, no.

29:45.800 --> 29:48.000
You found God?  No, it's not like
that.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.160
He found you?

29:49.160 --> 29:51.920
No, I'm too canny for him,
he can't track me down.

29:53.800 --> 29:55.720
I don't know what to tell you, Col.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.480
Now, here's the question.

30:03.280 --> 30:06.080
Why didn't you just walk away?

30:06.080 --> 30:08.240
Because you're the problem.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.320
I'm to blame for you.

30:10.320 --> 30:12.720
If it wasn't for you...
Oh, I'm the problem?!

30:12.720 --> 30:14.360
I'm the problem?

30:14.360 --> 30:15.640
You're a drug dealer.

30:15.640 --> 30:17.320
I give people something they want,

30:17.320 --> 30:19.880
something they choose to buy freely,
Lou.

30:19.880 --> 30:23.200
The drugs you sell ruin people's
lives, you know that.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.040
Oh, God! If only people choose a

30:25.040 --> 30:27.920
more respectable way of ruining
themselves, eh, Bulge?

30:27.920 --> 30:30.480
Like drink and fags, and takeaways,
and betting,

30:30.480 --> 30:32.640
and anything else with a tax code.

30:32.640 --> 30:34.760
Oh, you can't compare the two.
Oh, can I not?

30:34.760 --> 30:37.080
My da never broke the law for his
fix.

30:37.080 --> 30:39.800
Every last drop of alcohol,
legally obtained.

30:39.800 --> 30:43.120
And that was such a great comfort to
us.

30:43.120 --> 30:46.360
When he shat himself at Christmas
dinner.

30:46.360 --> 30:50.320
When he threw a pan of hot oil
over my mother.

30:50.320 --> 30:52.840
When he died at
54 years old,

30:52.840 --> 30:55.920
all small and yellow, with a wee
pregnant tummy.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.800
If it's bad for you but feels good,

30:57.800 --> 31:00.800
people are going to find
a way to do it.

31:00.800 --> 31:03.720
Legal, illegal, that's just the
prevailing wind.

31:03.720 --> 31:06.880
It has fuck all to do with right
and wrong.

31:06.880 --> 31:08.400
Chemicals don't have morals.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.040
Oh, Jesus, don't try and justify
what you do.

31:11.040 --> 31:12.880
Why not? Why not?

31:12.880 --> 31:14.320
You know how many heroin addicts

31:14.320 --> 31:16.440
there were in Britain in the 1960s?
Around 300.

31:16.440 --> 31:19.000
And do you know where they got their
gear from? Do you know that?

31:19.000 --> 31:22.480
Boots.
Boots, The Chemist, on prescription.

31:24.120 --> 31:26.800
And then the politics changed
and well, here we are.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.360
But all of this was a choice, Lou.

31:28.360 --> 31:30.520
What about all the people
that you hurt?

31:30.520 --> 31:33.080
You don't even know half
the stuff you do!

31:33.080 --> 31:34.680
We did all this together.

31:34.680 --> 31:36.200
No! If I'd never met you...

31:36.200 --> 31:38.520
You were looking for me, just like I
was looking for you.

31:38.520 --> 31:40.840
We're exactly the same.

31:40.840 --> 31:42.920
We're the same.

31:42.920 --> 31:45.360
We want to skip a few rungs
together, don't we?

31:45.360 --> 31:48.000
We want to fucking get somewhere,
and fucking do something.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.640
And all their rules out there are a
fucking joke to us.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.280
But I know that.

31:52.280 --> 31:56.160
I know who I am and so does everyone
else around me.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.640
But you, you're a fucking liar!

31:59.720 --> 32:01.520
You are a liar!

32:03.320 --> 32:05.400
You lie to every person around you!

32:05.400 --> 32:07.720
Me, Ceri, Owen, yourself!

32:07.720 --> 32:10.520
You're even lying right now!

32:10.520 --> 32:13.080
You are not as honest as you
think you are, Col.

32:13.080 --> 32:14.560
My da held me underwater once.

32:14.560 --> 32:16.320
Didn't he, Bulge? My da.

32:17.400 --> 32:19.200
Jesus Christ, the fear, the panic.

32:19.200 --> 32:21.320
Now imagine...

32:21.320 --> 32:23.200
..imagine Owen just

32:23.200 --> 32:26.320
looking up at his pal, James...

32:26.320 --> 32:28.600
..and just thinking, "Why, for
God's sake? Don't do this to me."

32:28.600 --> 32:31.200
In fact, no, I wouldn't let that
happen, that wouldn't be fair.

32:31.200 --> 32:34.520
I'd get him say it was because of
you, first, so at least he'd know.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.600
No.

32:35.600 --> 32:37.440
You fucking touch him and I'll kill
you!

32:37.440 --> 32:39.120
And if I don't, Ceri will rip your
eyes out!

32:39.120 --> 32:40.800
That's what you're going to think
now

32:40.800 --> 32:42.640
but most people, when someone they
love gets hurt

32:42.640 --> 32:44.120
and it's their fault, it rips the

32:44.120 --> 32:45.880
fight out of them, it breaks you.

32:48.960 --> 32:50.800
Is that what happened to you?

32:52.200 --> 32:55.320
Is that what happened to you, when
Aoife killed herself with your gear?

33:00.880 --> 33:02.120
WHISPERS:  Don't.

33:02.120 --> 33:03.840
Or what, you'll kill me again?

33:03.840 --> 33:06.080
You'll kill me twice?

33:06.080 --> 33:10.440
You supplied the drugs that your
daughter used to kill herself.

33:11.800 --> 33:13.640
You know that.

33:13.640 --> 33:16.040
She knew that, the whole world knows
that!

33:16.040 --> 33:17.520
But I'll bet you a tenner I'm

33:17.520 --> 33:19.240
the first one to say it out-loud.
Don't you...

33:19.240 --> 33:21.200
The truth,  you want the truth?  Don't
you use her name.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.960
No-one talks about Aoife

33:22.960 --> 33:25.920
because everyone knows that she
fucking hated you.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.600
And she used your drugs to end her
life.

33:28.600 --> 33:31.640
But chemicals don't have morals.
Bulgey.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.480
"You know who you are"?

33:34.480 --> 33:36.480
THAT is who you are, Col!

33:36.480 --> 33:38.800
And when I'm gone, there'll be
no-one else to tell you.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.280
No more lies, I promise.

33:45.280 --> 33:47.040
I promise.

33:50.560 --> 33:53.440
Oh, go on, just get it over with,
I haven't got all day.

33:54.360 --> 33:55.960
SHE SNIFFS

33:58.200 --> 34:00.120
Argh!

34:01.640 --> 34:03.440
Argh!

34:19.480 --> 34:21.240
Go home.

34:23.640 --> 34:25.600
Donal will bring Owen back unharmed.

34:25.600 --> 34:28.720
And this is the last time
we see each other.

34:28.720 --> 34:30.400
One fucking chance.

34:31.880 --> 34:35.080
Ever come after me again, Lou,
everything changes.

35:01.840 --> 35:03.560
PHONE PINGS

35:08.360 --> 35:10.240
Oh.

35:13.400 --> 35:16.680
I  can't tell whether that's good
news or bad.

35:16.680 --> 35:19.040
It's good news.

35:19.040 --> 35:20.760
But we should probably head back.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.560
After...

35:23.560 --> 35:25.080
..a swim.

35:25.080 --> 35:26.920
Yeah?

35:26.920 --> 35:28.400
Come on.

35:32.080 --> 35:35.000
Right. If you want to have a
look at me cock,

35:35.000 --> 35:36.800
do it now...

35:36.800 --> 35:38.680
..and not when I come out. Yeah?

35:41.480 --> 35:43.200
OK.

35:48.160 --> 35:50.280
Woohoo!

35:51.560 --> 35:54.440
Argh!

35:54.440 --> 35:56.280
Come on!

35:59.160 --> 36:00.880
Come on, mate!

36:00.880 --> 36:02.360
What are you waiting for?

36:05.800 --> 36:07.320
Oh.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.760
Woo!

36:15.960 --> 36:17.480
OWEN ON VOICEMAIL:  Hello?

36:17.480 --> 36:19.480
Hello?

36:19.480 --> 36:21.120
OK, old voicemail joke

36:21.120 --> 36:23.000
but admit it, I got you.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.920
It's Owen, leave a message.

36:27.520 --> 36:29.080
CERI:  Lou, what's happened?

36:29.080 --> 36:30.440
Is Owen OK?

36:30.440 --> 36:33.040
Yeah, everything's OK.
Just come home.

36:33.040 --> 36:35.120
Owen?

36:35.120 --> 36:37.840
CERI:  What's going on?
Are you all right?

36:37.840 --> 36:39.560
Lou?

36:39.560 --> 36:41.640
I'll explain, just come home.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.720
Thanks for an...

37:08.720 --> 37:12.880
..odd and confusing and
hypothermia-y day.

37:12.880 --> 37:15.640
Yeah, look, mate...

37:15.640 --> 37:18.120
..I'm sorry about the whole...
Like I said...

37:19.560 --> 37:21.200
..it's cool.

37:32.240 --> 37:34.040
James...

37:35.400 --> 37:37.520
..if you don't want that, then...

37:38.760 --> 37:40.640
..what are we doing?

37:41.920 --> 37:45.200
Is this just like a field trip
version of the group?

37:47.840 --> 37:51.280
That's fine, by the way.

37:51.280 --> 37:54.000
It's just nice to have some
sort of road map.

37:57.480 --> 37:58.880
I don't know.

38:01.720 --> 38:03.400
It's...

38:05.200 --> 38:07.400
..it's just good to talk to someone,
in't it?

38:11.800 --> 38:13.520
See you at Sad Bastards Group?

38:41.080 --> 38:43.240
LOU ON VOICEMAIL: Owen, love, you've
got to call me back,

38:43.240 --> 38:45.480
it's important. OK?
As soon as.

38:45.480 --> 38:46.960
I love you.

38:46.960 --> 38:48.520
Bye.

38:50.040 --> 38:51.680
Mum?

38:55.960 --> 38:57.720
What's this voicemail about?

39:01.520 --> 39:03.200
Mum?

39:05.480 --> 39:07.120
Tell me what's going on?

39:07.120 --> 39:08.520
Nothing.

39:08.520 --> 39:09.800
Don't matter.

39:09.800 --> 39:10.960
Everything's OK.

39:12.960 --> 39:14.920
I'm going for a shower.

39:46.480 --> 39:49.400
You're his son, aren't you?

39:49.400 --> 39:50.960
And?

39:52.360 --> 39:53.800
What were you doing with Owen?

39:53.800 --> 39:55.480
Nothing, just talking.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.360
I-I swear.

39:57.360 --> 39:59.840
He don't even know who I am, he
thinks I'm from the group.

40:01.480 --> 40:03.000
You're James?

40:05.760 --> 40:06.880
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

40:06.880 --> 40:08.680
You're fucking James!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

40:08.680 --> 40:11.560
It's done, it's done, it's over.
I swear, I swear.

40:11.560 --> 40:13.400
No harm done, yeah?

40:13.400 --> 40:15.000
I were never going to hurt him.

40:18.480 --> 40:19.960
Ah!

40:21.120 --> 40:23.160
Me da will fucking kill you!

40:26.800 --> 40:28.840
If I ever see you here again...

40:47.280 --> 40:48.960
What happened?

40:57.760 --> 40:59.440
Boss?

41:00.560 --> 41:02.520
Boss, just listen to me!

41:02.520 --> 41:04.480
Just listen to me.

41:04.480 --> 41:05.840
You can't do this!

41:06.960 --> 41:10.560
Boss, you do this, we'll
never be safe.

41:10.560 --> 41:11.720
She'll come again.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.440
What happened?

41:13.440 --> 41:14.640
Slack.

41:14.640 --> 41:17.240
She tried to stitch him up
and he let her walk!

41:19.440 --> 41:23.240
Alma, if he doesn't deal with her,
we're done.

41:23.240 --> 41:24.960
Everybody will know you can take a

41:24.960 --> 41:27.000
shot at Col McHugh, he don't fight
back.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.400
I've made my decision.

41:28.400 --> 41:30.560
It's not just you!

41:30.560 --> 41:32.200
What about your people?

41:32.200 --> 41:34.360
They go down with you!

41:34.360 --> 41:36.840
It's a fair question, Boss.

41:36.840 --> 41:39.280
I were an O'Brien man through
and through.

41:39.280 --> 41:40.800
And when you were takin' over, when

41:40.800 --> 41:43.720
I went with you, I got a lot of
grief.

41:43.720 --> 41:46.320
Traitor, all that.

41:46.320 --> 41:48.000
I threw in with you because I could

41:48.000 --> 41:49.560
see you were the right man for the
job.

41:49.560 --> 41:51.840
And I never, ever doubted that.

41:53.640 --> 41:56.080
Till now.  Bulgey, Curtis, would
you...?

42:11.840 --> 42:13.920
She tried to hurt us and you just
let her go?

42:13.920 --> 42:15.960
Make up your mind, Alma.

42:18.800 --> 42:21.320
Either you want out of this life...

42:22.520 --> 42:24.840
..or you want me to kill a woman who

42:24.840 --> 42:27.960
was sitting at our table two weeks
ago.

42:27.960 --> 42:29.920
Police officer...

42:29.920 --> 42:32.880
..a friend of 20 years, a mother to
a wee lad.

42:32.880 --> 42:34.040
You love her?

42:36.240 --> 42:38.320
Not like that, and you know it.

42:40.680 --> 42:43.840
Sometimes, I wish it was like that,
it wouldn't make you weak.

42:43.840 --> 42:45.680
What was I supposed to do?

42:45.680 --> 42:48.040
Keep us safe.

42:48.040 --> 42:50.840
But you haven't done that in a long
time.

42:50.840 --> 42:52.320
Mum!

43:00.760 --> 43:03.280
I don't get it.

43:03.280 --> 43:04.760
Why would he just...

43:05.880 --> 43:07.680
..let you go?

43:09.760 --> 43:11.720
Cos he cares about me?

43:14.520 --> 43:15.840
Have I ruined it?

43:15.840 --> 43:17.200
No.

43:17.200 --> 43:18.600
I ruined it.

43:18.600 --> 43:20.960
A long time ago.

43:20.960 --> 43:23.560
But he's not going to change his
mind, so.

43:24.760 --> 43:26.920
But it's his son.

43:26.920 --> 43:28.480
Yeah.

43:28.480 --> 43:30.240
KNOCK AT DOOR

43:30.240 --> 43:31.880
DOORBELL RINGS

43:40.560 --> 43:42.400
What was that this morning?

43:42.400 --> 43:43.800
Did you know he had nothing on him?

43:46.480 --> 43:49.560
Or maybe this whole thing were about
tying me up in your mess and making

43:49.560 --> 43:51.360
it harder for me to go to Sandy.

43:51.360 --> 43:52.920
Est, I'd never do that to you.

43:52.920 --> 43:55.800
Yeah, forgive me if I don't take
that as gospel.

43:55.800 --> 43:57.640
She's asking me all sorts now.

43:57.640 --> 43:59.240
How the tip came in, how the source

43:59.240 --> 44:01.160
knew what were going on in McHugh's
house.

44:01.160 --> 44:03.200
I've already had to lie to her.

44:03.200 --> 44:04.760
I'm sorry, I...

44:04.760 --> 44:06.720
I really thought we had a shot at
him.

44:06.720 --> 44:09.040
Well, then, what happened?

44:09.040 --> 44:12.640
I tried to smoke him out, and he saw
straight through me.

44:12.640 --> 44:14.640
And then he took Owen.

44:14.640 --> 44:16.240
What?

44:16.240 --> 44:17.760
Is he OK?

44:17.760 --> 44:19.680
Yeah he's OK, he's upstairs.

44:21.440 --> 44:24.120
Lou, we have to go in now.
You need protection, you need to

44:24.120 --> 44:26.760
make sure that your family is...
Look, he's given me one last chance.

44:26.760 --> 44:28.880
OK? He'll leave us alone if I leave
him alone.

44:28.880 --> 44:31.920
But if I breathe a word against him,
the deal is off.

44:31.920 --> 44:34.000
So you go do whatever you have to.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.280
OK? I get it, I really do.

44:36.280 --> 44:38.880
But I will deny everything, to
protect Ceri and Owen.

44:41.240 --> 44:43.720
Well, then, I'm fucked then,
aren't I?

44:45.680 --> 44:47.480
It'll be my word against yours.

44:48.640 --> 44:51.560
A two-year DC grassing on a DI.

44:51.560 --> 44:54.520
God, not just any DI.

44:54.520 --> 44:56.880
Plus, I took your dodgy tip.

44:56.880 --> 45:00.160
And I've lied to Sandy, I'm halfway
to discrediting meself.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Jebem ti! How dare he?

45:12.080 --> 45:13.520
Da?

45:16.640 --> 45:18.440
Da...

45:18.440 --> 45:19.840
..I want to be there.

45:21.640 --> 45:24.360
Whoever you send,
I'm going with them.

45:25.400 --> 45:26.560
Whoever I send?

45:27.640 --> 45:29.320
Whoever I send?

45:31.360 --> 45:33.960
God forbid you fight your own
battles, Donal.

45:33.960 --> 45:35.680
Col!  What?

45:35.680 --> 45:38.880
You took the man's son, got a hiding
for it. Fair's fair.

45:38.880 --> 45:41.240
Now, if you want to keep going,
that's up to you.

45:41.240 --> 45:44.600
But judging by the state
of your wee face...

45:44.600 --> 45:46.280
..you might want to leave it be.

45:55.120 --> 45:57.160
BULGEY SPITS

45:59.280 --> 46:01.320
That your resignation, is it, Bulge?

46:04.480 --> 46:06.080
What happened to you?

46:26.280 --> 46:28.840
It's OK, Mum, it's OK.

46:28.840 --> 46:30.680
Did you even fight back?

48:03.640 --> 48:05.400
Not dead, then.

48:08.120 --> 48:11.280
It's the best possible result,
Slack.

48:11.280 --> 48:12.920
I'm touched you came to tell me.

48:12.920 --> 48:14.200
SHE SCOFFS

48:16.840 --> 48:18.600
What?

48:20.480 --> 48:22.440
He's still out there.

48:22.440 --> 48:23.840
So are you.

48:28.040 --> 48:31.320
I don't go in much for guilt,
meself.

48:32.920 --> 48:34.880
The one thing I do know about it,

48:34.880 --> 48:37.120
is it's ours and ours alone.

48:37.120 --> 48:38.680
He can't atone for you.

48:38.680 --> 48:39.840
CAT MEOWS

48:39.840 --> 48:41.680
Well, what do you want me to do?

48:41.680 --> 48:43.560
How about the right thing?

48:43.560 --> 48:45.440
I mean, if I turn myself in now,

48:45.440 --> 48:47.600
I put me family in danger.

48:47.600 --> 48:51.440
You put them in danger first time
you took his money.

48:51.440 --> 48:53.120
They've never been safe.

48:53.120 --> 48:55.560
CAT GURGLES

48:55.560 --> 48:58.360
You OK?

48:58.360 --> 49:01.320
Only usually makes that
noise when I kick it.

49:06.680 --> 49:08.360
Did you take it to the vet in the
end?

49:08.360 --> 49:09.640
Yeah, nowt doing.

49:09.640 --> 49:11.760
Do you know how much they want to
put it down?

49:11.760 --> 49:14.360
World's gone mad
if it's cheaper to keep it alive.

49:14.360 --> 49:16.000
DOG BARKS

49:16.000 --> 49:18.400
Yeah, daylight robbery.

49:18.400 --> 49:20.960
Although it barely resembles
a cat any more, Vern.

49:34.520 --> 49:36.040
I know you.

49:36.040 --> 49:37.640
You were the O'Briens' knifeman.

49:37.640 --> 49:40.400
They should've pensioned
you off years ago.

49:40.400 --> 49:42.520
Argh!

49:44.720 --> 49:46.440
Argh!

49:48.160 --> 49:49.800
Argh!

49:56.600 --> 49:58.080
Col let me go!

49:58.080 --> 50:00.840
His head's gone, mine hasn't!

50:00.840 --> 50:03.760
I knew you'd come again.

50:03.760 --> 50:05.360
Argh!

50:27.360 --> 50:29.320
Don't fucking touch me.

50:29.320 --> 50:30.480
Listen to the man.

50:30.480 --> 50:31.760
Call 999, Vernon!

50:31.760 --> 50:33.480
They'll never get here in time.

51:03.600 --> 51:05.120
You need to go.

51:07.600 --> 51:11.280
You need to leave, even my
neighbours will report a gunshot.

51:11.280 --> 51:12.760
Don't touch anything.

51:12.760 --> 51:14.480
Come on, come here.

51:21.840 --> 51:23.360
Have some of that.

51:25.080 --> 51:26.520
Rinse them again.

51:30.880 --> 51:32.440
No, use  your top.

51:32.440 --> 51:34.840
Then get rid of them clothes
when you get home.

51:34.840 --> 51:37.360
This isn't going to work, Vern.
We can but try, but you need to

51:37.360 --> 51:39.280
skedaddle - now.

51:39.280 --> 51:40.760
Well, where will you go?

51:40.760 --> 51:41.920
I've got a little bolthole in

51:41.920 --> 51:43.640
Guadalajara for just such
eventualities.

51:43.640 --> 51:45.360
The jet's fuelled and waiting.

51:45.360 --> 51:47.440
No, Vern...  Don't worry.

51:47.440 --> 51:50.280
It'll be all right, I'll spin them a
good yarn, you won't feature.

51:50.280 --> 51:51.760
I can't let you do this.

51:51.760 --> 51:53.080
I shot him, didn't I?

51:53.080 --> 51:55.720
Because of me.
Because he followed me.

51:55.720 --> 51:57.120
If I hadn't come here that day...

51:57.120 --> 51:59.080
Yeah, but you did and I'm glad.

52:01.040 --> 52:02.760
I never helped anyone before.

52:04.400 --> 52:06.120
Now, come on, piss off,

52:06.120 --> 52:08.040
you've got your family to think of.

52:08.040 --> 52:12.120
Me and my pal, we need to be alone.

52:12.120 --> 52:14.240
You're going to
go down for the gun alone.

52:14.240 --> 52:16.320
No... I'll tell 'em
I got it in a jumble sale.

52:16.320 --> 52:17.680
Zip it up.

52:17.680 --> 52:20.040
I'll come visit ya.
Will ya, bollocks.

52:20.040 --> 52:21.680
How suspicious would that look?

52:21.680 --> 52:23.440
That's it, now, come on, go...

52:24.520 --> 52:25.800
Go on.

52:27.800 --> 52:31.240

52:57.720 --> 52:59.560
CAT MEOWS

53:16.480 --> 53:17.800
Oh, sod it.

53:21.080 --> 53:22.880
KNOCKS ON DOOR

53:29.360 --> 53:31.120
Er...

53:31.120 --> 53:33.040

53:53.920 --> 53:56.440
DIAL TONE

53:56.440 --> 53:58.040
Emergency, which service?

53:58.040 --> 54:00.280
Fire, police.

54:01.760 --> 54:03.560
I'd say, send the lot.

54:03.560 --> 54:05.240
Address?

54:05.240 --> 54:10.040
Yep. 51 Drakefield Street,
Seacroft.

54:11.520 --> 54:12.840
And what's happened?

54:12.840 --> 54:14.560
Well,

54:14.560 --> 54:16.160
I've shot an intruder dead...

54:18.640 --> 54:20.240
..then set me house on fire.

54:23.840 --> 54:25.400
Err, someone's on their way.

54:25.400 --> 54:26.560
Right.

54:30.680 --> 54:34.560
That's my story
and I'm sticking to it.

54:57.960 --> 55:00.320
GLASS SHATTERS

55:00.320 --> 55:01.360

55:15.200 --> 55:16.800

55:16.800 --> 55:18.360
Yeah?  Yeah.

55:18.360 --> 55:20.800
You want the bad news or
the good news?

55:20.800 --> 55:22.160
Um...

55:22.160 --> 55:23.680
The bad news...  Mm?

55:23.680 --> 55:25.360
..I've overcooked the pasta.

55:25.360 --> 55:27.320
The good news, there's loads left.

55:28.640 --> 55:29.920
OK.

55:29.920 --> 55:31.400

55:31.400 --> 55:32.840

55:49.880 --> 55:52.920
Give my legs a rub, will ya?
They're sore today.

55:54.600 --> 55:56.280
What's this? Spa treatment?

55:56.280 --> 55:57.600
Right, I'm next.

55:57.600 --> 55:58.880
VOICES BECOME MUFFLED

55:58.880 --> 56:00.360
Quick question for ya.

56:00.360 --> 56:03.040
Are you recovering from a serious
illness which almost killed ya?

56:03.040 --> 56:05.760
All right, maybe not,
but I am out on site every day,

56:05.760 --> 56:08.320
risking my life,
up and down wobbly ladders,

56:08.320 --> 56:11.040
dodging falling bricks,
all to provide for my family.

56:11.040 --> 56:13.640
VOICES FADE OUT

56:32.400 --> 56:34.400
SIRENS BLARE

56:43.920 --> 56:46.960
INDISTINCT CONVERSATION
