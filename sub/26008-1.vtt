Hey.

02:17.635 --> 02:18.871
How you doing today, honey?

02:19.938 --> 02:21.441
- Me?
- Yeah.

02:21.873 --> 02:22.876
I'm great.

02:23.308 --> 02:24.576
- Okay.
- I'm great.

02:25.276 --> 02:26.578
We're going all out today, okay?

02:27.413 --> 02:28.681
Balls to the wall!

02:29.314 --> 02:30.383
Balls to the wall!

02:37.889 --> 02:38.891
Thank you, honey.

02:43.461 --> 02:44.429
Okay.

02:53.405 --> 02:55.672
- Hey Lisa.
- Mm-hmm.

02:55.674 --> 02:57.406
There's some... there's some
sort of weird sound

02:57.408 --> 02:59.309
in the locker room,
but I couldn't really tell

02:59.311 --> 03:00.677
where it was coming from.

03:00.679 --> 03:02.282
What kind of sound?

03:02.580 --> 03:05.450
I don't know. Just like a...
like a banging, or something.

03:05.985 --> 03:07.253
Is it from the ceiling?

03:07.819 --> 03:09.388
Yeah, yeah, it could be,
I guess.

03:09.854 --> 03:12.457
Okay, please, don't mess
with me today, A/C. I Just...

03:14.727 --> 03:15.929
- Lisa!
- Hi.

03:16.495 --> 03:18.661
- Oh, hi.
- Hey, I'm Jennelle.

03:18.663 --> 03:20.731
I'm here for the, um,
the interview.

03:20.733 --> 03:23.566
Oh, yes. Nice and early.
Okay, I like that.

03:23.568 --> 03:25.835
- So, I'm hired?
- Oh, well, uh, probably,

03:25.837 --> 03:27.571
sweetheart.
But we gotta be professional

03:27.573 --> 03:29.305
- and check off all our boxes.
- Yeah, no, I... I love

03:29.307 --> 03:30.874
being professional.
That's always, like huge for me.

03:30.876 --> 03:32.844
Just have a seat.
Well, yeah, get comfy.

03:35.046 --> 03:37.449
Can I ask, do you get, like,
grabbed?

03:38.883 --> 03:40.951
It happens. Yeah.
Like when someone's

03:40.953 --> 03:43.887
super wasted or whatever,
but it's pretty rare,

03:43.889 --> 03:45.856
and you can usually tell when
something like that's coming,

03:45.858 --> 03:48.058
you know, and just
kind of like... boop.

03:48.060 --> 03:49.692
You know, let me just say this,

03:49.694 --> 03:51.928
uh, we have a zero-tolerance
policy on it.

03:51.930 --> 03:53.763
You know, I don't mind
calling the cops if a customer's

03:53.765 --> 03:55.399
committing the crime
of sexual assault and trust me,

03:55.401 --> 03:56.966
I don't have to call far
because you know what?

03:56.968 --> 03:58.768
We have a lot of officers
who are regulars.

03:58.770 --> 04:01.406
And Officer Dominguez
is a cutie. I think.

04:05.777 --> 04:08.978
Uh, but seriously, y'all, um...
let me just say,

04:08.980 --> 04:12.018
the most important thing is that
this is a mainstream place,

04:12.418 --> 04:13.850
you know?
And it's a family place,

04:13.852 --> 04:16.019
which means a lot of families
come here.

04:16.021 --> 04:17.923
And it also means
that we're all family.

04:18.389 --> 04:20.856
And yeah, you're not, you know,
you're not wearing a whole

04:20.858 --> 04:23.560
lot of clothes but, trust me,
if these guys wanted

04:23.562 --> 04:25.529
to go to a strip club,
they know where to find them.

04:25.531 --> 04:27.663
They just come here so some
sweet girls can take

04:27.665 --> 04:29.533
good care of 'em.
It's like, like working at...

04:29.535 --> 04:31.968
at Chili's or Applebee's
except it's more fun,

04:31.970 --> 04:33.339
and the tips are way better.

04:33.538 --> 04:35.774
- Usually.
- If you know how to work it.

04:36.709 --> 04:37.776
Well...

04:38.978 --> 04:41.711
Okay, so next, ladies,
if you can just turn around

04:41.713 --> 04:43.447
right behind you,
you're gonna see

04:43.449 --> 04:46.082
Whammies' golden rules.
Let's go straight to number two.

04:46.084 --> 04:47.786
Be responsible.

04:49.588 --> 04:52.456
All right, I hate firing people.
Uh, it breaks my heart.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.423
It's the least favorite part
of my job.

04:54.425 --> 04:56.459
But, I do it when I have to.
I mean, there've been girls

04:56.461 --> 04:59.029
that I would have literally
donated a kidney to,

04:59.031 --> 05:02.466
but they couldn't get it together
to get to work on time and so,

05:02.468 --> 05:04.637
you know, I just, I did...
I did what I had to do.

05:08.072 --> 05:11.474
Maybe like a... possum?

05:11.476 --> 05:13.945
You know what, will you take
over for me? Excuse me, ladies.

05:15.047 --> 05:20.851
Um... okay, so be informed.

05:20.853 --> 05:23.820
That's like, she was like,
"be responsible."

05:23.822 --> 05:26.391
It's kind of the same part
of that. Um...

05:30.862 --> 05:31.863
Hey!

05:32.564 --> 05:33.697
Hello?

05:33.699 --> 05:35.768
Help! I'm in the vent!

05:37.002 --> 05:38.603
What are you doing in the vent?

05:40.906 --> 05:43.975
Is this, uh...
is this your head right here?

05:45.644 --> 05:47.480
- Yeah.
- Okay.

05:48.947 --> 05:50.813
- Go a little bit higher.
- Yeah.

05:50.815 --> 05:52.983
And then look on the other side.
And see if there's anything

05:52.985 --> 05:54.754
on the other side
that we can loosen it up.

05:58.524 --> 05:59.759
Oh, is this the safe, here?

06:00.158 --> 06:01.824
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, he knew

06:01.826 --> 06:03.560
exactly what he was trying
to get to.

06:03.562 --> 06:05.495
We'll let you take a look at him
once we get him out,

06:05.497 --> 06:06.699
see if you can ID him.

06:07.132 --> 06:09.468
Most likely he's either
a former employee,

06:09.668 --> 06:11.704
or he's associated
with an employee.

06:11.937 --> 06:14.171
So, you might want to start thinking
if any of your people make you feel

06:14.173 --> 06:15.841
- a little suspicious.
- Okay.

06:16.475 --> 06:18.541
Uh, meanwhile,
can I open for business?

06:18.543 --> 06:20.142
Oh, yeah, sure. Sure.
We'll stay out

06:20.144 --> 06:21.713
of the customers' sight.
We'll use the back door.

06:22.180 --> 06:22.981
Thank the Lord.

06:23.682 --> 06:25.951
Oh, and Lisa,
is the owner on the way?

06:27.952 --> 06:29.888
I haven't gotten in touch
with him yet, but, uh,

06:30.822 --> 06:32.625
- I'll let you know. Okay.
- All right. Thank you.

06:33.192 --> 06:34.160
Thank you.

06:35.793 --> 06:39.197
"Fuck that, I play better sports
than that fag."

06:41.834 --> 06:44.233
Oh, my gosh, you're a badass,
huh?

06:44.235 --> 06:46.605
Do you wanna refill
on that Big Ass Beer?

06:47.505 --> 06:49.038
Mm-hmm.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.675
So, Big Ass is our large size.
So, I found a good

06:51.677 --> 06:53.709
connected moment to pause
the conversation,

06:53.711 --> 06:55.711
kinda leave him wanting
more, right?

06:55.713 --> 06:57.884
And, um... you know,
sell that beer.

06:58.250 --> 07:02.084
Touch-wise; a little touch
on the shoulder, arm area, hand,

07:02.086 --> 07:04.022
that's all good,
but nowhere else.

07:04.589 --> 07:07.759
And try not to squeeze,
because that can get weird.

07:08.726 --> 07:12.695
Uh, real weird... um... Yeah,
and notice how I opened my mouth

07:12.697 --> 07:14.998
real wide when I laughed,
like...

07:15.000 --> 07:16.733
Yeah, that's just like...

07:16.735 --> 07:17.901
y'all don't have to do that,
I just find it works

07:17.903 --> 07:19.004
really well for me.

07:19.872 --> 07:22.038
All right, well thank you,
Maci.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.709
Is everything making sense
to everybody?

07:23.975 --> 07:25.574
Yes.

07:25.576 --> 07:28.077
Okay, good. So, now, uh,
is usually the time

07:28.079 --> 07:30.546
when we let y'all go and tell
you we'll be in touch soon,

07:30.548 --> 07:33.582
but today is kind
of a crazy day and, uh, well,

07:33.584 --> 07:37.586
I have a favor to ask. Um, I know
you have other things to do,

07:37.588 --> 07:39.990
but anyone who's willing
to hang out and just dive

07:39.992 --> 07:42.726
into the deep end,
we're having a car wash

07:42.728 --> 07:45.628
fundraiser today.
Uh, it's... it's not on

07:45.630 --> 07:47.596
the official payroll or anything
like that, but, you know,

07:47.598 --> 07:50.634
we would be willing to pay you
out in cash at our trainee rate,

07:50.636 --> 07:52.868
and if you cannot do it,
that is not a problem.

07:52.870 --> 07:55.305
It does not affect whether
or not you get hired.

07:55.307 --> 07:56.776
But what, you mean like today?

07:57.009 --> 08:00.145
Today, through the lunch rush.
If you can.

08:01.913 --> 08:03.312
All right, Maci, she can run you
through everything.

08:03.314 --> 08:05.180
In the meantime, I got to get us
a sound system.

08:05.182 --> 08:07.819
So, thank you, ladies.
Beautiful.

08:09.321 --> 08:12.956
Um, I can't stay, I'm so sorry, I've
got like four other interviews today.

08:12.958 --> 08:14.858
Oh. Oh, yeah.
No, that's fine.

08:14.860 --> 08:16.959
That's fine.
It was nice to meet you, Taylor.

08:16.961 --> 08:18.598
- It was nice to meet you too.
- Bye. Bye Taylor.

08:20.598 --> 08:21.968
Okay.

08:22.199 --> 08:24.067
<i>Confirm that he is
behind the wall.</i>

08:24.069 --> 08:26.101
No, like the duct system.
The metal tube in the ceiling.

08:26.103 --> 08:27.904
<i>They're asking
if you mean like in</i> Die Hard.

08:27.906 --> 08:30.209
- Hey.
- McKray is sick

08:30.608 --> 08:32.674
and I don't have a sitter.

08:32.677 --> 08:35.280
Okay, I was gonna ask if you could
cover Shaina's shift tonight.

08:35.813 --> 08:38.216
You know I don't say no
to no shifts, but...

08:38.783 --> 08:39.985
How you feeling, my man?

08:40.952 --> 08:42.017
I've felt better.

08:42.019 --> 08:43.751
Yeah?

08:43.754 --> 08:45.924
Okay, well we're gonna take good
care of you, all right?

08:47.091 --> 08:51.227
Uh, if, uh, Tatiana or,
or maybe Nika could pick him up

08:51.229 --> 08:53.533
and sit him at one of their
places, would you trust them?

08:53.798 --> 08:57.636
Nika, yes.
Tatiana, I don't know...

08:58.135 --> 09:00.369
All right. All right.
Well, we got this.

09:00.371 --> 09:02.674
Meanwhile, I need you
on a special mission.

09:02.941 --> 09:04.076
Come on in here.

09:09.047 --> 09:11.815
Hey, Maci, you want to hang
with my main man McKray

09:11.817 --> 09:13.349
- for a sec?
- Hell, yeah!

09:13.351 --> 09:15.053
What's up, McCrazypants?

09:15.821 --> 09:16.555
Uh...

09:18.255 --> 09:19.858
How much you think
Jay likes you?

09:20.158 --> 09:21.724
I'm not trying to find out?

09:21.726 --> 09:23.093
You think he'd be willing
to set us up

09:23.095 --> 09:24.629
with a sound system today,
for free? If...

09:25.864 --> 09:28.864
If maybe you just... you know,
we, you, whoever just, well,

09:28.866 --> 09:31.236
you... if you flirt
just a little?

09:31.736 --> 09:32.971
For why?

09:34.105 --> 09:35.405
Car wash fundraiser today.
It's not on the schedule,

09:35.407 --> 09:36.940
- I know.
- Is that supposed to be up

09:36.942 --> 09:38.577
- on our social? It's not.
- I...

09:39.144 --> 09:40.745
Shaina hit her boyfriend
with a car last night.

09:41.178 --> 09:43.747
Broke his leg.
She's at my place

09:43.749 --> 09:45.748
with Cameron now.
I... I... I bailed her out

09:45.750 --> 09:47.150
of jail, but this is serious,
and... and...

09:47.152 --> 09:48.888
and she's gonna need
a real lawyer on it.

09:50.154 --> 09:52.857
She's a dumb... you know
I love her,

09:53.091 --> 09:55.992
- but she's a dumb bitch.
- Don't you dare use that word.

09:55.994 --> 09:57.893
Now, come on, we're family.

09:57.895 --> 10:00.098
My family's full
of dumb bitches too.

10:00.298 --> 10:03.869
Shit, Lisa, when are you gonna
hold a fundraiser for me?

10:04.769 --> 10:07.203
You need me to run over my ex?
I'll be glad to.

10:07.205 --> 10:09.204
You know we'd do the same thing
for you in this situation.

10:09.206 --> 10:11.041
You know that.
Chris was out of control.

10:11.043 --> 10:12.043
Come on.

10:15.714 --> 10:16.682
Cool?

10:17.548 --> 10:19.049
All right, all right, all right.
Okay.

10:19.051 --> 10:21.086
Let's call Nika and get you
some childcare.

10:23.989 --> 10:24.956
Uh-oh.

10:26.024 --> 10:28.257
Luckily, she's not working
today 'cause you're not

10:28.259 --> 10:30.859
allowed to put two black girls
on the same shift.

10:30.861 --> 10:32.395
Oh, Danyelle...

10:32.397 --> 10:34.797
Speaking of lawyers,
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.

10:34.799 --> 10:37.199
Cubby better watch out.
I could make some good money

10:37.201 --> 10:38.803
- off this case.
- Hey, uh...

10:40.404 --> 10:42.405
Nika, it's... it's Lisa.
Call me.

10:42.407 --> 10:44.473
Uh, I need a favor if you can.

10:44.475 --> 10:47.712
Just... just call me back
and I'll text you, too. Okay.

10:50.148 --> 10:51.149
Can I ask you something?

10:55.187 --> 10:56.154
Do you like working here?

10:57.022 --> 10:59.792
You can be honest. No.
Think about it.

11:00.024 --> 11:01.394
I like working with you.

11:03.828 --> 11:06.064
You left Shaina alone
with your husband?

11:07.099 --> 11:09.001
That's the last thing
I'm worried about with Cameron.

11:09.301 --> 11:11.336
- Morning, ladies.
- Hey Tom. Is Jay here?

11:12.971 --> 11:14.306
Jay, to the front please.

11:16.107 --> 11:18.009
Miss Danyelle! Good morning.

11:18.243 --> 11:19.441
And Lisa.

11:19.443 --> 11:20.913
Yeah, Lisa, hey.

11:21.113 --> 11:22.911
So, what brings you across
the lot?

11:22.913 --> 11:25.050
Are we renting you
a system today?

11:26.217 --> 11:28.386
You're always trying to get me
to come over and take the tour,

11:28.820 --> 11:30.855
Lisa said I could come over
and take the tour.

11:31.123 --> 11:33.189
- Yeah.
- Awesome! Well...

11:33.191 --> 11:36.327
it's not a tour, actually. It's
a home theater demonstration.

11:36.961 --> 11:37.962
Wow...

11:38.996 --> 11:40.098
Yeah.

11:47.239 --> 11:49.138
I gotta admit,
I was actually hoping

11:49.140 --> 11:52.110
to catch you out here after work
sometime, like...

11:52.543 --> 11:55.014
maybe in your uniform.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.048
Surprise!

11:57.481 --> 12:00.483
Oh, it's gotta be my birthday.

12:00.485 --> 12:01.986
If it isn't, I'm gonna change it
to today.

12:03.221 --> 12:05.356
Uh, how long
is the demonstration?

12:05.856 --> 12:09.191
Oh, our basic's pretty quick
but if you got time,

12:09.193 --> 12:11.094
I would love to run you
through some of the, uh,

12:11.096 --> 12:12.498
- enhanced...
- I know you would.

12:12.998 --> 12:16.435
She knows I would.
Are you gonna join us?

12:16.902 --> 12:19.371
Uh, you know, I might have
to duck out in a minute.

12:19.870 --> 12:22.238
Okay, cool.
Well, um, you know,

12:22.240 --> 12:24.306
if you have time,
come by anytime.

12:24.308 --> 12:26.077
I'd love to show you through
the full demo as well.

12:26.544 --> 12:28.511
In the meanwhile,
you have nothing to worry about.

12:28.513 --> 12:30.512
I'm not gonna do
anything nonconsensual

12:30.514 --> 12:32.250
- with your girl here.
- I'd kill you.

12:32.583 --> 12:34.819
Yeah. She'd kill you, Jay.

12:35.320 --> 12:36.585
And then I'd have to tell
your wife,

12:36.587 --> 12:38.289
and she'd kill you again.

12:39.456 --> 12:40.926
All right. Let's start...

12:53.572 --> 12:55.941
<i>The pictures
are beautiful.</i>

12:57.942 --> 13:01.013
<i>They provide us with a lot
of useful information.</i>

13:02.447 --> 13:04.982
<i>But how does it feel?</i>

13:19.530 --> 13:22.934
<i>How does it intrigue our minds
and touch our hearts?</i>

13:28.340 --> 13:32.275
<i>Sit back. Relax.
And let your ears</i>

13:32.277 --> 13:35.413
<i>and our patented surround
system take you on a journey.</i>

13:50.629 --> 13:52.431
I will make this happen for you.

13:53.097 --> 13:56.201
- For Shaina.
- You're amazing and I love you.

14:02.474 --> 14:03.542
<i>Time, itself...</i>

14:07.278 --> 14:09.081
You working for me now, Bobo?

14:09.514 --> 14:11.414
You know me, I wouldn't take no
for an answer.

14:11.416 --> 14:14.150
Listen, you know I love that
chivalry, but I can't have it.

14:14.152 --> 14:16.622
Well, it's not like
I'm gonna get you fired.

14:17.154 --> 14:20.022
I hear you're un-fireable, anyway.
Hey, let me help you with that.

14:20.024 --> 14:20.925
Oh.

14:21.826 --> 14:24.964
Thank you. Here we go.
You guys are new.

14:25.163 --> 14:27.162
How you doing? I'm Bobo.

14:27.164 --> 14:29.235
- "Bobo"?
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.267
You know, we're not open
for another 15 minutes.

14:31.269 --> 14:33.102
Oh hell, I'd just be sitting
in my truck listening

14:33.104 --> 14:35.975
to my police scanner app.
Did we have a break-in, I hear?

14:38.610 --> 14:39.611
Come on in.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.244
I thought
you'd never ask, darling.

14:42.246 --> 14:43.979
Uh...

14:43.981 --> 14:45.250
Did you really, now?

14:48.452 --> 14:50.219
- Good morning, officers.
- Morning, fellas.

14:50.221 --> 14:53.323
Morning. Um, hey, Lisa.
This shouldn't take too long.

14:53.325 --> 14:55.624
Probably like 20, 25 minutes,
tops I'd say, so...

14:55.626 --> 14:58.396
Okay. Okay, good.
Uh, Nevaeh,

14:59.063 --> 15:00.966
you want to get
Bobo a Big Ass beer here?

15:01.332 --> 15:02.500
- Sure.
- On the house.

15:04.101 --> 15:06.137
- Lone Star?
- What? Before noon?

15:06.571 --> 15:09.375
Uh... did the burglar
get the foosball table?

15:10.375 --> 15:12.241
Oh, no.
Uh, you know what,

15:12.243 --> 15:14.213
uh, the owner, he wanted to try
something new in that spot.

15:14.412 --> 15:16.478
And I'm sorry, 'cause I know
you were dominating.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.147
Is it a pool table?

15:18.149 --> 15:20.616
I am not sure yet.
Uh, but I'll let you know.

15:20.618 --> 15:23.719
Hey, bud. Guess what?
I just texted our girl Nika

15:23.721 --> 15:25.588
and she is on her way
to get you soon,

15:25.590 --> 15:27.390
and she's gonna take you back
to her place where you can

15:27.392 --> 15:29.392
chill out all day.
And she's got Netflix

15:29.394 --> 15:31.029
and all that.
So you're gonna have fun.

15:33.764 --> 15:35.631
- There.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

15:35.633 --> 15:37.400
Hey, officers, can I get
y'all something to drink?

15:37.402 --> 15:39.102
- Oh, no, ma'am.
- Oh, I'm sorry. You know what?

15:39.104 --> 15:40.536
I'm just gonna act like
I didn't hear it.

15:40.538 --> 15:42.405
Act like you didn't.
I didn't say nothing.

15:42.407 --> 15:43.709
- We're on the clock.
- Okay, on the clock.

15:46.344 --> 15:47.246
Hey, Lisa.

15:48.379 --> 15:51.683
Maci said that, uh, fundraiser
out there is for Shaina?

15:52.182 --> 15:53.217
What's going on with her?

15:54.251 --> 15:56.051
You are my favorite customer,
but you know what?

15:56.053 --> 15:58.286
- You are way too nosy.
- What?

15:58.288 --> 16:00.757
This is supposed to be a place that you
can come in to chill out and relax.

16:00.759 --> 16:03.225
All I'm saying is,
if you got a fundraiser

16:03.227 --> 16:05.795
people gotta know what it's for.
I mean, if she's got cancer

16:05.797 --> 16:08.600
or something, I hope not,
but just say that.

16:09.333 --> 16:10.767
- People are gonna wonder.
- Well, she doesn't.

16:10.769 --> 16:12.738
And you know what, they won't.
Just you, Bobo.

16:14.105 --> 16:15.640
It's that shit-heel
boyfriend of hers?

16:16.274 --> 16:19.077
I was here when that went down.
In fact, I have video.

16:22.647 --> 16:24.479
<i>Are you fuckin'
kidding me right now?</i>

16:24.481 --> 16:25.985
<i>It's none of your business,
pal!</i>

16:27.285 --> 16:29.654
<i>Look, this is a business
so it is my business.</i>

16:30.154 --> 16:32.287
<i>And you do not talk to her
like that. Yeah.</i>

16:32.289 --> 16:34.156
<i>- You trying to get hurt, bro?</i>
<i>- Stop, Chris.</i>

16:34.158 --> 16:36.092
<i>You trying to get
fucking hurt, bro! Come on.</i>

16:36.094 --> 16:38.393
<i>No, okay,
and she wants you to leave,</i>

16:38.395 --> 16:40.595
- <i>all right? So, I'm telling you, you have to go.</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>

16:40.597 --> 16:42.767
- <i>I want you to suck my dick, faggot! Huh?</i>
<i>- Okay, enough.</i>

16:43.368 --> 16:45.501
<i>How about that? Don't touch me.
I'm leaving.</i>

16:45.503 --> 16:47.203
- <i>Calling the cops.</i>
- <i>Don't fucking touch me.</i>

16:47.205 --> 16:49.408
<i>All right, let's go. Out.
Right now. Go.</i>

16:50.140 --> 16:54.178
Uh... well... uh, how about, uh,
we call it

16:54.812 --> 16:56.314
"The Sisterhood Fund"?

16:57.816 --> 16:59.118
Not your market.

17:08.826 --> 17:11.096
- Morning, fellas.
- Morning.

17:11.429 --> 17:14.700
Have y'all seen any evidence of Mr.
and Mrs. Rat around here today?

17:16.800 --> 17:19.134
This is a family place,
but that is one family

17:19.136 --> 17:20.672
I never want to see
in here again.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.109
- You good, Arturo?
- Mm-hmm!

17:25.742 --> 17:26.743
Okay.

17:33.317 --> 17:35.253
I'm just saying, like,
don't shit where you eat.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.321
I appreciate your advice.

17:37.888 --> 17:40.658
Hey, uh, ladies?
If it's about shifts,

17:40.892 --> 17:42.094
talk to me.

17:42.861 --> 17:44.296
It's fine. Nothing.

17:44.895 --> 17:46.065
All right. Okay.

17:47.565 --> 17:49.332
Jay is loading up the speakers
right now.

17:49.334 --> 17:51.135
Should be good to go
in like ten minutes.

17:51.336 --> 17:54.504
I told him he gets free lunch
for a week, but if he gets fired

17:54.506 --> 17:56.404
though, that's on you, ma.

17:56.406 --> 18:00.242
Oh, my goodness! McKray! McKray!
Did you know that your mama's

18:00.244 --> 18:01.911
a real-life Wonder Woman?
Do you?

18:01.913 --> 18:03.613
Mm-hm.

18:03.615 --> 18:05.280
And you're the wind beneath
my frickin' wings.

18:05.282 --> 18:08.584
My buffalo wings.
Oops, can't say "frickin'"

18:08.586 --> 18:10.152
in front of the customers.

18:10.154 --> 18:11.490
Girl, you say
whatever you like.

18:11.923 --> 18:13.224
Oh, boy.

18:26.203 --> 18:27.702
Did they just knock out
my cable?

18:27.704 --> 18:30.274
Um, let me, let me check.
Hold on one second.

18:32.410 --> 18:33.345
Sorry.

18:34.346 --> 18:35.777
No. Uh-huh.
But that's what I'm saying,

18:35.779 --> 18:37.446
though.
We're... we're actually...

18:37.448 --> 18:39.485
we're not residential,
we're a business, though.

18:39.951 --> 18:41.120
Uh-huh.

18:42.221 --> 18:44.189
Well, is there someone else
that I could talk to?

18:45.423 --> 18:46.956
No.
Double Whammies, we're on

18:46.958 --> 18:49.824
the I-10 frontage. Uh-huh.

18:49.826 --> 18:51.563
We're a sports-themed
bar and grill,

18:51.962 --> 18:54.732
so the TVs are... are crucial
for us. Mm-hmm.

18:54.932 --> 18:56.899
Well, you... no, you tell me,
whatever I can do to get

18:56.901 --> 18:58.901
our ticket pushed to the front
of the line, and, and you know,

18:58.903 --> 19:00.204
I'll... I'll do whatever.

19:01.838 --> 19:03.407
Yeah.

19:03.674 --> 19:05.941
No, no, I've already just...
I've been on hold already

19:05.943 --> 19:07.778
for 20 minutes, and I...
and I've really got a whole...

19:08.846 --> 19:09.914
Mm-hmm.

19:10.414 --> 19:12.451
Yeah.
No, I... I understand. Okay.

19:12.750 --> 19:13.818
I will hold. Thank you.

19:17.855 --> 19:19.691
<i>Your call
is important to us.</i>

19:38.308 --> 19:41.677
Uh, hi, this is Lisa, is this...
is this about the apartment?

19:41.679 --> 19:43.578
Okay, great.
I'm on the other line.

19:43.580 --> 19:44.582
Can I call you...

19:45.616 --> 19:47.752
Oh, uh, you're kidding me.

19:49.354 --> 19:50.556
Uh-huh. No.

19:51.656 --> 19:53.756
No, no, no, listen.
I... I... I will get my husband

19:53.758 --> 19:56.260
over there, uh,
sometime today. Somehow.

20:00.030 --> 20:01.666
Mm-hmm. Yes.

20:02.733 --> 20:03.734
Okay. Bye-bye.

20:07.739 --> 20:10.241
Hello? Hello?

20:11.476 --> 20:13.478
Shit...

20:22.653 --> 20:23.654

20:26.490 --> 20:27.491

I'll tell Maci you're here,

21:29.921 --> 21:31.957
and she'll have your coffee
on the table, okay?

21:33.124 --> 21:34.960
Okay. Meanwhile, we just...

21:35.359 --> 21:36.961
we appreciate your generosity out here.
Thank you so much.

21:37.662 --> 21:38.963
Can I steal you for a second?

21:41.999 --> 21:43.501
I'll get her back. I promise.

21:44.769 --> 21:46.602
Is anybody asking
what the money's for?

21:46.604 --> 21:48.470
They think it's for new uniforms
which is, like, fine.

21:48.472 --> 21:50.439
But I'm trying to create upsell
opportunities.

21:50.441 --> 21:52.141
So, I'm going to tell this old
guy it's for medical stuff,

21:52.143 --> 21:53.709
cause, like, he can relate
to that.

21:53.711 --> 21:55.944
Okay, no, no, no. Don't do that.
Don't lie.

21:55.946 --> 21:57.645
Just, uh, maybe you can just
say, "safety net."

21:57.647 --> 21:59.515
No, it's not lying.
I'm just going to spin it.

21:59.517 --> 22:00.882
Right, but if you just...
if you just say, "safety net,"

22:00.884 --> 22:02.718
- that...
- Well, this guy with a goatee

22:02.720 --> 22:04.085
asked me if it was for us
to get boob jobs and I said,

22:04.087 --> 22:05.022
"hell yeah", and he gave me
50 bucks.

22:05.923 --> 22:07.358
I'm, like, a marketing major.

22:08.425 --> 22:11.062
So, like, it's really all
about demographics.

22:14.832 --> 22:17.499
They did start to bring him
through the front, but I told

22:17.501 --> 22:20.603
them to turn around and not
to bother the customers. Okay?

22:20.605 --> 22:21.906
Hey! Hey, Lisa!

22:22.173 --> 22:24.606
Totally nobody noticed, okay?

22:24.608 --> 22:26.711
Oh, hey, professor.
Coffee's brewing!

22:29.980 --> 22:31.383
Did you get a good look at him?

22:32.849 --> 22:34.552
Yeah. Yeah, yeah...

22:34.818 --> 22:35.851
Familiar?

22:35.853 --> 22:37.589
Um, no. I don't think so.

22:38.722 --> 22:39.657
You okay?

22:40.557 --> 22:41.826
Yeah. Everything's good.

22:52.670 --> 22:56.942
So, Arturo.
You know I'm good with faces.

22:58.075 --> 22:59.811
And I did recognize your cousin.

23:01.979 --> 23:03.582
Well, I didn't tell
the officers.

23:05.849 --> 23:07.482
I know you're dealing
with a lot, lately.

23:07.484 --> 23:09.887
So, I... I just decided to be
generous today.

23:11.122 --> 23:12.457
You are every day.

23:13.557 --> 23:14.593
What's that?

23:15.226 --> 23:16.928
You're generous every day, Lisa.

23:18.162 --> 23:20.664
Well, thank you, Arturo.

23:21.699 --> 23:23.468
So, you know you can't work
here anymore.

23:26.237 --> 23:28.903
Wait, wait, wait.
Hey, now, I got nobody

23:28.905 --> 23:31.574
to fill in, so I... I do need
you to finish your shift,

23:31.576 --> 23:34.613
and uh, you can quit at the end
of the day, okay?

23:35.813 --> 23:36.681
Okay.

23:36.913 --> 23:37.848
Okay.

24:24.729 --> 24:26.895
You see, sometimes
you gotta put a little nudge

24:26.897 --> 24:28.764
into it.
You know, sometimes it takes

24:28.766 --> 24:31.699
a little bit of muscle just
to get that, that gear going

24:31.701 --> 24:32.871
to get the starter...

24:33.069 --> 24:34.803
You know, contrary
to what you may believe,

24:34.805 --> 24:36.708
I'm actually really
perfectly fine with a B cup.

24:36.973 --> 24:38.576
- I mean...
- Are you now?

24:38.776 --> 24:41.813
How do I... I married you,
honey. That's how I know.

24:49.886 --> 24:52.223
Look there, see?
I'm not the only one.

24:52.890 --> 24:54.993
Hell, I kicked that boy's ass!

24:55.259 --> 24:56.528
What you working on, bud?

24:57.161 --> 24:58.196
Just a ninja guy.

24:58.796 --> 24:59.831
Oh.

25:00.064 --> 25:01.199
What about you?

25:01.665 --> 25:02.666
The schedule.

25:04.602 --> 25:05.604
You like puzzles?

25:06.570 --> 25:08.572
Okay, well, look.
Let me show you something.

25:09.173 --> 25:12.173
All right, so, see right here?
These are all the shifts

25:12.175 --> 25:13.144
that I need covered.

25:14.111 --> 25:16.812
And here, this is how
many people I need.

25:16.814 --> 25:19.518
Now, if it's a big night like
a fight or a game

25:19.784 --> 25:23.017
I need extras. I need cooks.
I need busboys. Right here.

25:23.019 --> 25:25.723
You can see my bench.
And then over here,

25:26.790 --> 25:28.356
these are my superstars.
You can see your mom,

25:28.358 --> 25:30.292
she's right at the top.
Now, I always gotta make sure

25:30.294 --> 25:32.327
that I'm careful to space them
out, you know, because I gotta

25:32.329 --> 25:34.031
make sure there's enough
for everybody and then...

25:36.032 --> 25:38.669
Well, anyway, now,
how do you know that

25:38.903 --> 25:41.804
that's not a ninja girl? Hmm?
All wrapped up

25:41.806 --> 25:45.110
in that crazy costume. You can't
really see the face now, can you?

25:45.675 --> 25:46.677
No boobs.

25:46.978 --> 25:49.678
Mm-hmm.
But you know, not every girl

25:49.680 --> 25:51.850
is always walking around
sticking them out, especially

25:52.215 --> 25:54.318
if they've got a lot
of superhero stuff to do.

25:55.019 --> 25:57.923
He's not a superhero though,
he's a ninja.

25:59.723 --> 26:00.759
Okay.

26:01.726 --> 26:02.727
She.

26:04.327 --> 26:05.195
Can I take a picture?

26:06.163 --> 26:09.198
Let's see...
I wanna send it to our girl,

26:09.200 --> 26:11.102
Shaina, because it reminds me
of her.

26:12.303 --> 26:15.607
Let's see. There we go. Ah.

26:16.039 --> 26:18.876
Hey, uh, I've got a situation.

26:19.343 --> 26:20.579
Oh.

26:23.346 --> 26:24.912
- Biker guy...
- Mm-hmm.

26:24.914 --> 26:26.248
in the back corner sitting
by himself.

26:26.250 --> 26:27.783
Mm-hmm.

26:27.785 --> 26:29.086
Basically, like,
just called me fat.

26:29.854 --> 26:31.122
- Basically?
- Yeah.

26:33.124 --> 26:36.928
Hey, uh, I think that there's
a guy throwing up in there.

26:37.228 --> 26:40.362
Uh, okay.
Is everybody treating you right

26:40.364 --> 26:42.831
- out there? Any questions?
- I don't think so.

26:42.833 --> 26:45.202
Okay, good. Y'all are killing
it, I appreciate you.

26:46.002 --> 26:47.902
I feel the sisterhood
growing stronger!

26:47.904 --> 26:49.307
Sisterhood! Whoo!

26:51.776 --> 26:54.776
Okay. Biker guy. In the corner.
Let me take care of this,

26:54.778 --> 26:58.016
and then I got it. All right?
Okay.

26:59.916 --> 27:01.251
Sorry, I was just...

27:03.453 --> 27:04.923
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah. It's all right.

27:05.155 --> 27:06.124
It's all right.

27:17.902 --> 27:20.372
You are so... like, what?
You are smart.

27:24.474 --> 27:26.275
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yeah?

27:26.277 --> 27:28.376
My name is Lisa,
I'm the general manager.

27:28.378 --> 27:30.214
And my girl just said you got a
little disrespectful with her?

27:31.048 --> 27:32.948
- Uh, what?
- You might have thought

27:32.950 --> 27:34.117
you were just
having a little fun,

27:34.884 --> 27:37.486
but I have a zero-tolerance
policy on disrespect so, uh,

27:37.488 --> 27:40.389
- you're gonna have to go.
- I haven't gotten my food yet.

27:40.391 --> 27:42.826
You haven't paid for it either.
So, let's just call it even,

27:43.227 --> 27:44.959
okay? If you want to throw in
an apology,

27:44.961 --> 27:47.028
- that'll really be...
- That's fucking bullshit.

27:47.030 --> 27:48.430
- I didn't harass shit!
- Listen, I'm not gonna argue with you.

27:48.432 --> 27:50.201
- I made a joke!
- I'm done asking you nicely.

27:50.401 --> 27:52.137
So, you kick people out
for being funny?

27:52.336 --> 27:55.373
- You must be the...
- I am done asking you nicely.

27:55.772 --> 27:57.506
- You marching today?
- Pick your ass up and go eat

27:57.508 --> 27:59.507
- somewhere else.
- I heard you the first time.

27:59.509 --> 28:00.979
So, now what are you
gonna do?

28:08.519 --> 28:09.721
Blow me!

28:15.992 --> 28:18.462
Okay, everybody.
Enjoy your food.

28:21.865 --> 28:23.364
- Hey. Uh,
- Hey.

28:23.366 --> 28:25.066
there's a guy out there
with a tricked-out hummer.

28:25.068 --> 28:26.270
Maybe the little boy would
wanna see?

28:26.936 --> 28:29.373
Hey, McKray! Come here.

28:36.012 --> 28:38.346
<i>♪ Bling bling bitch,
Do my own thing bitch ♪</i>

28:38.348 --> 28:40.350
Ooh, pretty cool!

28:50.294 --> 28:53.064
Super sweet.
Smells good too.

28:53.396 --> 28:54.962
I bet this bitch
wasn't cheap.

28:54.964 --> 28:56.000
No, it was not.

28:56.400 --> 28:57.736
You wanna check it out,
little man?

28:59.970 --> 29:01.072
Thank you.

29:04.208 --> 29:06.978
Oh, wow. Look at this.
All these...

29:08.144 --> 29:10.115
This man really likes...

29:14.384 --> 29:16.450
So, the thing with a guy
like that is that you know

29:16.452 --> 29:17.955
his mama didn't raise him right.

29:18.489 --> 29:20.421
Now, I know I'm never gonna
have to worry about that

29:20.423 --> 29:22.793
with you, my little dude. Right?
Because you got respect.

29:23.294 --> 29:26.965
- Always.
- Always! Always. Always.

29:27.230 --> 29:29.131
For real, where the hell
is Nika?

29:29.133 --> 29:30.802
I don't know but she'll be here.

29:31.999 --> 29:33.067
Hey, tell me this,
how are you raising

29:33.069 --> 29:35.240
- such a sweet kid?
- I have no idea.

29:35.439 --> 29:38.243
I just think he's too smart
to end up like his mama.

29:38.509 --> 29:40.010
Boy is paying attention!

29:40.611 --> 29:42.914
Oh, wait.
I think this is her now.

29:44.381 --> 29:47.216
Oh, no, it's Shaina! Look!

29:47.218 --> 29:49.017
See, she loved
the ninja picture.

29:49.019 --> 29:50.255
I told you she was gonna
love it.

29:50.621 --> 29:53.992
- Love. Love. Love.
- Nika! Nika!

29:56.460 --> 29:58.160
I just told you she was coming.

29:58.162 --> 30:00.094
Too late. Too late.
McKray died from boredom.

30:00.096 --> 30:01.630
I'm sorry it took so long.

30:01.632 --> 30:03.433
Come on, McKray.
Let's get your stuff.

30:08.571 --> 30:10.271
- What's up?
- I don't know

30:10.273 --> 30:12.342
- how you can guzzle that stuff.
- Chocolate milk rules!

30:13.576 --> 30:18.380
Hey, um, look, I noticed
you getting a little friendly

30:18.382 --> 30:19.484
with the Professor and...

30:20.785 --> 30:24.085
I know. I know. I'm sorry. It's
just he's... he's super sweet

30:24.087 --> 30:26.054
and super harmless.
And he's like a little puppy

30:26.056 --> 30:27.488
and I can't help but wanting
to give him

30:27.490 --> 30:29.624
a little extra attention,
that's all.

30:29.626 --> 30:31.461
You know, I totally trust your judgement.
But, you know, we can't...

30:32.328 --> 30:33.961
- I'm sorry.
- ...let the other girls see

30:33.963 --> 30:35.197
that 'cause they,
they get confused.

30:35.199 --> 30:36.968
- Totally.
- And... and I don't

30:37.999 --> 30:38.366
- wanna send mixed messages.
- But he did...

30:38.368 --> 30:40.201
He did used
to be a lawyer though,

30:40.203 --> 30:42.671
and I did ask him if maybe
he could recommend someone

30:42.673 --> 30:45.375
that could help Shaina out for
cheap and he said he would ask.

30:45.643 --> 30:47.211
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:47.544 --> 30:49.881
But I'm keeping
that thing totally secret

30:50.079 --> 30:51.313
just like you asked.

30:51.315 --> 30:52.450
Not telling anyone.
Doing my best.

30:56.619 --> 30:57.888
Thank you.

31:01.557 --> 31:05.693
Hey! Hey! Off that!
Get off the... off the car.

31:05.695 --> 31:07.296
- It's a Lexus!
- What is your name?

31:07.298 --> 31:09.363
- What is your name?
- Jennelle.

31:09.365 --> 31:12.366
Jennelle, we are mainstream, bar and grill.
Come here, please.

31:12.368 --> 31:13.468
Come here.

31:13.470 --> 31:15.073
She's making sick money, though.

31:16.973 --> 31:18.308
I think
we're over a thousand now.

31:24.048 --> 31:25.048
Fuck!

31:36.993 --> 31:38.262
Remind me what this is.

31:38.595 --> 31:40.530
Car wash.
We do it all the time.

31:40.730 --> 31:42.901
As a scheduled promotion
with some kind of theme.

31:43.500 --> 31:46.401
Well, the theme is making money.
And I'm using it

31:46.403 --> 31:47.605
as a training exercise.

31:49.205 --> 31:50.240
These are new hires?

31:50.740 --> 31:53.176
Not... not... not officially,
not... not yet. But...

31:54.478 --> 31:55.480
yeah.

32:07.191 --> 32:09.059
Heard we had a break-in.

32:09.326 --> 32:12.294
Yeah, yeah, but they didn't get anything,
and they caught the guy, so...

32:12.296 --> 32:13.728
A buddy on the force
called me.

32:13.730 --> 32:15.529
I'm wondering why I didn't get
a call from you.

32:15.531 --> 32:18.699
Uh, well, you know,
I didn't wanna ruin your trip.

32:18.701 --> 32:22.339
But while we're doing bad news, uh,
Cubby, they did knock out the cable.

32:23.374 --> 32:26.173
Which, you know,
I'm on the cable people's butt

32:26.175 --> 32:28.045
about this 'cause I know
it's top priority.

32:28.412 --> 32:30.011
- Hey, Cubby...
- So...

32:30.013 --> 32:31.048
...what are you gonna
do with this hole?

32:32.583 --> 32:34.615
- Bobo...
- Talk to my general manager, man.

32:34.617 --> 32:36.485
Well, I did, Cubby,
but she doesn't know...

32:36.487 --> 32:38.221
- Hi, Bobo.
- Hi.

32:38.721 --> 32:41.425
I'm just coming to distract you,
so my boss can get her work done.

32:42.092 --> 32:43.261
A/C guy is here.

32:45.662 --> 32:48.466
He's just patching it for now and
insurance adjuster is coming tomorrow.

32:48.766 --> 32:50.465
- And he didn't get anything.
- Nope.

32:50.467 --> 32:51.970
He didn't even make it out
of the ceiling.

32:53.438 --> 32:57.271
I don't love the idea of this sitting
here with the door open all day.

32:57.273 --> 32:59.076
Yeah. Well, you know,
I'm sorry,

32:59.308 --> 33:01.176
but there's just been a lot of
folks needing to get in and out

33:01.178 --> 33:03.114
all day but it's mostly cops,
so it's real, real secure.

33:03.547 --> 33:04.749
Speaking of which...

33:06.482 --> 33:10.053
it's not legal to have
those girls working out there.

33:10.421 --> 33:12.554
- They're not employees.
- It's a one-time thing, Cubby.

33:12.556 --> 33:14.459
- And the cops don't care.
- What the fuck are you doing?

33:14.657 --> 33:16.326
Come on, man.
You know that's not the only

33:16.527 --> 33:18.462
"technically illegal" shit
going on around here.

33:18.729 --> 33:21.199
All right, well.
This is what I want you to do.

33:21.397 --> 33:23.398
I want you to gather up all
that car wash money

33:23.400 --> 33:25.534
and all of the cash
that's available on hand

33:25.536 --> 33:27.134
and get it to the bank
right now.

33:27.136 --> 33:29.171
The car wash is still
going on, though.

33:29.173 --> 33:32.106
Humor me.
Or, better yet, here's an idea,

33:32.108 --> 33:34.345
obey my direct order
as your employer.

33:44.188 --> 33:45.123
Come on.

33:46.656 --> 33:49.292
I told the smart one, she's
in-charge till you get back.

33:58.669 --> 34:00.338
My daddy used to say,

34:01.672 --> 34:05.076
"The time to fire someone
is when you first think of it."

34:05.608 --> 34:07.345
Well, bless his heart.

34:08.411 --> 34:10.414
What he didn't say
is what to do...

34:11.648 --> 34:14.284
when you try to fire 'em
and they just keep showing up.

34:14.550 --> 34:16.217
If you wanna fire me
there's paperwork

34:16.219 --> 34:18.088
you gotta fill out,
and I can show you how.

34:18.322 --> 34:20.123
Uh, first I was just like,
"You know, fuck it.

34:20.356 --> 34:21.889
She cares that much,
she's that committed

34:21.891 --> 34:23.293
to my business, I'll keep her."

34:25.429 --> 34:26.364
But now...

34:27.764 --> 34:29.567
to be honest with you,
I feel sorry for you.

34:30.634 --> 34:32.534
Oh, boy, you're in
a shit mood today.

34:32.536 --> 34:35.440
Oh, yes, I am. Ha, ha, ha.

34:38.242 --> 34:39.744
Let me show you something.

34:46.349 --> 34:47.684
Go big or go home.

34:48.385 --> 34:50.321
It's a different
business model. We'll be fine.

34:50.920 --> 34:53.123
We ain't gonna be fine.
They're nationwide!

34:53.757 --> 34:56.190
- They're gonna have TV ads and merchandising...
- Listen, it's apples

34:56.193 --> 34:57.825
and oranges.

34:57.827 --> 35:00.394
Yeah, they're nation-wide
but you're in a local place.

35:00.396 --> 35:02.329
- It's got it's regulars and...
- Send Bobo over here with the foosball table

35:02.331 --> 35:04.298
- and scare off their customers.
- You know what,

35:04.300 --> 35:06.501
if anything that's good, that'll
attract some new customers.

35:06.503 --> 35:08.836
You know it though. They'll say,
you know, we dig the concept,

35:08.838 --> 35:11.342
- you know, the Mancave...
- Lisa, I'm talking about reality here.

35:14.244 --> 35:16.344
I know the girls like
working for us, okay...

35:16.346 --> 35:18.646
- First off...
- ...because I ask them. But they're not dumb.

35:18.648 --> 35:20.949
- First of all...
- I mean, they do notice the racial thing.

35:20.951 --> 35:24.188
The Rainbow Guideline
is a guideline.

35:24.420 --> 35:27.722
Not an official policy, second,
we hire these young ladies

35:27.724 --> 35:29.824
as entertainers so we're legally
legit to cast them

35:29.826 --> 35:31.592
however we want.
That's why we don't have

35:31.594 --> 35:34.829
to hire any fat girls.
And no, I don't appreciate

35:34.831 --> 35:36.831
having to explain to you
of all people

35:36.833 --> 35:39.233
- that I don't discriminate.
- Nobody called you racist.

35:39.235 --> 35:40.969
Oh, we're gonna go there?
Really?

35:40.971 --> 35:42.737
- I'm not going there.
- All right. Well then, just

35:42.739 --> 35:45.673
for argument's sake,
let's just say, I don't know,

35:45.675 --> 35:47.608
I put all the Hispanic girls
on one shift.

35:47.610 --> 35:50.181
Where's the diversity in that?
The whole point is diversity.

35:52.315 --> 35:54.682
You know, the truth is
I don't really need you to love

35:54.684 --> 35:56.818
every little thing about it,
I just need you to do your job.

35:56.820 --> 35:59.688
My job? Oh, I do my job.

35:59.690 --> 36:02.159
I do everybody's job,
including yours!

36:02.391 --> 36:05.529
Yeah, but you don't enforce
rule number one, do you?

36:06.762 --> 36:09.463
- For real?
- Rule one, Lisa. No drama!

36:09.465 --> 36:11.932
You really want me to tell
a bunch of 20-year-old girls

36:11.934 --> 36:13.371
"no drama"?

36:13.637 --> 36:15.570
- Yes, I do.
- Okay, well why don't I just

36:15.572 --> 36:17.606
put up a sign right next to it
that says "no breathing" too!

36:17.608 --> 36:20.008
You know, you take that shit
so seriously.

36:20.010 --> 36:22.276
You know, they can go on and do
Shakespeare on their own time

36:22.278 --> 36:24.445
and you can go enjoy
the fuckin' show for all I care,

36:24.447 --> 36:25.713
but the emotion ends...

36:25.715 --> 36:27.449
- Tell me where it ends!
- The emotion...

36:27.451 --> 36:29.016
Tell me where it ends!
Because I wanna know...

36:29.018 --> 36:30.751
If you would stop interrupting
me, I'd love to tell you

36:30.753 --> 36:32.489
- where it ends!
- Right, all right.

36:34.891 --> 36:35.960
Okay.

36:37.760 --> 36:39.931
All right, let's just calm down.

36:42.331 --> 36:43.731
- God damn it!
- Jesus, Cubby!

36:43.733 --> 36:45.566
Who the fuck do these people
think they are!

36:45.568 --> 36:47.371
- Shit!
- Oh, I'm just the only one driving today!

36:47.670 --> 36:49.339
Only one out here!

36:49.539 --> 36:50.938
- Oh my god, you sound like...
- God damn, thinks he owns

36:50.940 --> 36:52.606
- the whole God damn road.
- ...a maniac!

36:52.608 --> 36:55.376
- Son of a bitch!
- Cubby, I'm still on the clock!

36:55.378 --> 36:57.414
- I'm gonna follow his ass home.
- What are you doing?

36:57.614 --> 36:58.615
Good Lord.

37:24.007 --> 37:26.309
<i>...foreign policy
was entirely coherent.</i>

37:38.889 --> 37:40.925
Fine. Okay. Okay.

37:51.469 --> 37:53.336
Catch your breath
and get off my property.

38:38.815 --> 38:40.481
- Lisa.
- Don't worry about me.

38:40.483 --> 38:41.552
Come on, you're still
on the clock.

38:41.851 --> 38:43.353
Which is why I don't need
this shit!

38:45.121 --> 38:46.656
Get in the car!

38:46.956 --> 38:47.891
No!

38:52.896 --> 38:54.461
Uh...

38:54.463 --> 38:56.366
Baby, are you driving?

38:57.099 --> 38:58.368
Okay, um...

38:59.101 --> 39:01.105
I need you to come get me.
I'm, uh...

39:02.172 --> 39:05.376
I need a ride.
I'm on the corner of, uh,

39:06.076 --> 39:07.878
Willow and uh...

39:09.012 --> 39:10.514
Schieffer. Schieffer.

39:10.880 --> 39:12.045
You wanna keep your job?

39:12.047 --> 39:14.617
S-C-H... uh, uh...

39:56.226 --> 39:57.758
You okay?

39:57.760 --> 39:58.862
Yeah, I'm fine.
How's Shaina?

39:59.896 --> 40:02.197
I don't know, she, uh,
she's been in the bedroom

40:02.199 --> 40:04.932
on the phone all morning.
She's probably came out once

40:04.934 --> 40:06.670
or twice to go to
the bathroom, but...

40:07.103 --> 40:09.204
Well, that's good. You know
what, she's getting some rest.

40:09.206 --> 40:10.541
That's what she needs to do.

40:14.510 --> 40:15.445
Back to Whammies?

40:19.148 --> 40:20.650
Uh,

40:21.952 --> 40:22.786
did you get a chance to follow
up with that apartment lady?

40:34.063 --> 40:36.898
There's a courtyard
out back with a grill

40:36.900 --> 40:38.135
for anyone to use.

40:38.668 --> 40:41.137
That's nice. That's nice.
Folks pretty social?

40:41.737 --> 40:44.040
Most of them are.
Nice people.

40:44.673 --> 40:46.643
Um, we can take a look
if you'd like.

40:47.244 --> 40:50.110
No, you know what, um,
I know that you know

40:50.112 --> 40:52.079
you need a decision, and we're
pretty rushed ourselves,

40:52.081 --> 40:53.516
so let me just
take the temperature.

40:53.916 --> 40:55.518
Cam, what do you think?

40:57.086 --> 40:58.688
You know, I like the location,

40:58.922 --> 41:00.954
you know. I... I... I gotta say,

41:00.956 --> 41:03.693
for the price, you know,
it's pretty, pretty okay.

41:04.027 --> 41:05.996
Um, y'all have any kids, pets?

41:06.195 --> 41:08.262
Our kids are mostly grown
and out the house.

41:08.264 --> 41:09.132
How many?

41:10.099 --> 41:11.766
Well, uh, let's see.
I've got my two boys,

41:11.768 --> 41:14.605
and then Cam's
got a beautiful girl.

41:15.038 --> 41:16.673
Just started at SMU.

41:17.773 --> 41:21.778
But the place would be
for, uh, just for him.

41:22.778 --> 41:23.780
No pets.

41:29.152 --> 41:30.086
Listen, uh...

41:30.954 --> 41:33.990
I think we should do it.
I do. I mean...

41:37.159 --> 41:39.696
I'm sorry, you're not gonna be able
to cross this off your list today.

41:40.730 --> 41:43.298
Ma'am, I apologize
for wasting your time.

41:43.300 --> 41:45.736
We, uh... it's not
gon' happen today.

41:48.237 --> 41:49.239
All right then.

41:49.806 --> 41:51.775
Okay, uh, thank you.

41:58.347 --> 42:02.215
Cameron, tell me what to do.
I mean, I hate this too,

42:02.217 --> 42:03.753
but if we agreed to move on...

42:04.019 --> 42:05.286
- You agreed.
- Okay, so then,

42:05.288 --> 42:06.190
what am I supp...

42:07.958 --> 42:09.726
Tell me something.
Tell me what to do.

42:10.092 --> 42:11.726
I mean it.

42:11.728 --> 42:13.797
I mean, am I not trying
hard enough? Tell me.

42:14.264 --> 42:16.363
If you need me to sit on the
couch and be sad with you

42:16.365 --> 42:17.999
sometimes then maybe
I should do that.

42:18.001 --> 42:19.203
Sad dudes is my business.

42:20.403 --> 42:22.302
- You know I'm not afraid of sad...
- I'm not your customer.

42:22.304 --> 42:25.139
I didn't say you were my
customer, but at least they try.

42:25.141 --> 42:27.110
They try to enjoy themselves.

42:27.309 --> 42:28.778
You know,
maybe that's the difference.

42:31.213 --> 42:33.280
All right, fine. Okay.
You're smarter than them.

42:33.282 --> 42:35.383
I get that.
But if I hadn't called

42:35.385 --> 42:37.918
and asked you for a ride,
then you'd still be sitting

42:37.920 --> 42:39.822
on the couch,
looking at your computer.

42:40.657 --> 42:42.657
It doesn't matter that
there's a girl in the next room

42:42.659 --> 42:44.925
who's in real trouble.
I always know

42:44.927 --> 42:47.096
at the end of the day exactly
what I'm gonna find.

42:50.367 --> 42:51.569
That's right.

42:54.804 --> 42:56.706
Well then, I guess you found
my weak spot.

42:58.875 --> 43:02.278
I can take fucking up all day,
but I can't take not trying.

43:08.885 --> 43:11.121
Look, I'm sorry.

43:12.355 --> 43:14.824
I'm just sorry, I shouldn't have
brought this up now, uh...

43:16.025 --> 43:17.661
That's my bad.
I gotta get back to work.

43:18.161 --> 43:19.096
Open the door.

43:36.346 --> 43:38.045
Uh,

43:38.047 --> 43:39.916
give this to Shaina
when you get home, please.

43:40.416 --> 43:42.182
Uh, tell her we're gonna
find her a lawyer

43:42.184 --> 43:44.721
and that'll just
help pay for it.

43:44.920 --> 43:46.723
Tell her it's from us girls
and that...

43:48.023 --> 43:49.692
just tell her that we love her.

44:00.936 --> 44:02.405
You know I love you too.

44:24.094 --> 44:25.896
I'll be back later tonight
after the fight.

44:32.936 --> 44:37.775
<i>♪ I need a man who's
Man enough to handle my love ♪</i>

44:38.108 --> 44:40.041
<i>♪ Come on, baby
Come on ♪</i>

44:40.043 --> 44:43.713
Hey, Cubby hasn't, uh, called
or come back through, has he?

44:43.980 --> 44:45.882
Mm-mm, no, uh, but we...

44:46.215 --> 44:48.818
we did have a little issue. Krista,
when she showed up for her shift...

44:49.085 --> 44:50.753
Oh, yeah, I saw her
at Juice Spot. Tell me.

44:51.521 --> 44:53.487
You know what,
total judgment call.

44:53.489 --> 44:55.088
Mm-hmm.
- I think you're gonna

44:55.090 --> 44:56.426
have to talk to her yourself.
I'm sorry.

44:57.126 --> 44:58.128
All right.

44:59.262 --> 45:01.231
Yeah, I mean absolutely, but...

45:01.530 --> 45:03.099
Oh, is that the cable people?

45:05.135 --> 45:07.071
Oh, wait, is everything okay
with McKray?

45:08.338 --> 45:09.339
Sure. Yeah.

45:10.940 --> 45:11.909
Yeah.

45:13.010 --> 45:16.978
Uh, you can go now.
Thank you for everything today.

45:16.980 --> 45:19.146
Yeah. No, she asked me
if I could stay

45:19.148 --> 45:21.050
and it sounded like you guys were
short, so I was totally happy to.

45:22.418 --> 45:25.987
Okay. Just, uh, just don't mess
with the, the uniform.

45:25.989 --> 45:26.990
- Okay?
- Yeah.

45:27.257 --> 45:28.291
All right. Thank you.

45:29.958 --> 45:32.195
Can I say I don't think
that'll be a mistake?

45:34.164 --> 45:35.065
Cubby.

45:37.166 --> 45:38.869
I know. That's just my opinion.

46:00.322 --> 46:02.759
You're the best and we love ya!

46:29.619 --> 46:30.521
Krista...

46:37.193 --> 46:38.295
I tried to time it just right.

46:38.628 --> 46:40.164
I thought it'd be more healed up
by now.

46:41.630 --> 46:44.432
Are you into basketball?
This is Steph Curry.

46:44.434 --> 46:45.803
- Greatest of All Time.
- Mm.

46:48.338 --> 46:51.572
I really like working at Whammies...
you know. And I love working for you.

46:51.574 --> 46:54.177
I mean, you're the best manager
I've ever had. By far.

46:54.376 --> 46:57.612
- Thank you, Krista, but...
- And I know what you did for Shaina today

46:57.614 --> 46:59.115
- and I think it's amazing.
- Mm-hmm.

46:59.414 --> 47:01.215
Chris is a dick
and he belongs in jail.

47:01.217 --> 47:03.586
Oh, well. God willing, yes.

47:07.956 --> 47:09.259
So, what? I'm fired, huh?

47:09.492 --> 47:12.028
Sweetheart. It breaks my heart.

47:12.327 --> 47:14.362
No. I get it. I mean,
it's a black man's face

47:14.364 --> 47:16.432
- on a white girl's body.
- No. No, that, that...

47:16.666 --> 47:18.566
- that's not it.
- Because, do you know what I love?

47:18.568 --> 47:19.903
It's not like it's The Mancave,

47:20.269 --> 47:21.304
you know,
where it's all corporate.

47:22.038 --> 47:23.907
Lots of girls with their tats
and their

47:24.239 --> 47:27.944
- individuality.
- Yeah. Uh...

47:29.378 --> 47:31.081
show it to me again.
Let me see it again.

47:39.621 --> 47:44.460
Krista...
what were you thinking?

47:44.693 --> 47:46.394
I mean, what were you thinking?

47:46.396 --> 47:48.362
Uh, that I work at a sports bar!

47:48.364 --> 47:51.164
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, you're right.

47:51.166 --> 47:52.603
And I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

47:53.969 --> 47:56.369
Listen, I, I promise you
I'm gonna do everything

47:56.371 --> 48:00.106
to help you land on your feet.
Okay? I do. No, no. Do you...

48:00.108 --> 48:01.508
- do you wanna work here?
- No...

48:01.510 --> 48:04.045
I know every manager
on this lot and I...

48:04.047 --> 48:05.014
You need an application?

48:06.315 --> 48:08.217
Not right now, thank you.

48:10.585 --> 48:13.656
Oh, but you know what?
I actually would like...

48:14.123 --> 48:15.659
Can I take a few
of those heart stickers?

48:16.492 --> 48:20.097
- Of course.
- Thank you. Thanks.

48:20.730 --> 48:24.367
Hey, look at these. Cute.

48:27.202 --> 48:29.403
Listen I've... I've had...
I've had a rough day, too.

48:29.405 --> 48:31.208
I have, you wanna
come have a drink with me?

48:32.141 --> 48:33.277
At Whammies?

48:35.445 --> 48:36.446
Yeah.

48:38.481 --> 48:42.749
- I know. I'm an embarrassment.
- Listen, this is your family.

48:42.751 --> 48:45.720
Hey, Jay.
"But how does it feel?"

48:45.722 --> 48:47.287
Mm...

48:47.289 --> 48:49.155
As far as I'm concerned,
my shift is over.

48:49.157 --> 48:50.693
We're just here to drink
like regular customers.

48:51.094 --> 48:52.496
Serve me, wench.

48:52.728 --> 48:54.463
All right. What do y'all want?

48:54.697 --> 48:56.262
- Gotta upsell!
- I don't know.

48:56.264 --> 48:57.764
- Mm.
- Something strong and sweet,

48:57.766 --> 48:59.335
so I don't realize
I'm drinking too much.

48:59.601 --> 49:00.767
- Hey, Maci!
- That's on me.

49:00.769 --> 49:03.407
Make two of, um... whatever.

49:06.108 --> 49:08.008
So, since y'all are not
on your shift,

49:08.010 --> 49:10.077
does that mean you still have
to laugh at my jokes or no?

49:10.079 --> 49:12.048
Are your jokes funny?

49:12.248 --> 49:14.382
- Half the time.
- Okay. That's not good enough.

49:14.384 --> 49:17.083
- Hey. Oh, come on.
- Can I talk to you for a second?

49:17.085 --> 49:18.520
Can you just come and sit
and have a drink with us?

49:21.090 --> 49:22.555
Hey. You got to treat them
like customers.

49:22.557 --> 49:24.124
They get at least three minutes
of facetime.

49:24.126 --> 49:26.195
You know what?
You're observant.

49:26.528 --> 49:28.565
That's rule number five.
Did you all know that?

49:28.797 --> 49:30.299
I know
what rule number one is.

49:32.135 --> 49:33.367
No tats of black dudes
on white girls.

49:33.369 --> 49:34.568
- Krista...
- Sorry.

49:34.570 --> 49:36.170
No, but for real,
isn't it like,

49:36.172 --> 49:37.637
"Don't sleep
with the sleaze-bag customers"?

49:37.639 --> 49:40.141
No, it's not. Come on, now, Jay.

49:40.143 --> 49:41.545
You know we don't think
of you like that.

49:41.811 --> 49:43.981
You know what?
I don't even want to know.

49:44.213 --> 49:45.746
Do not demystify me
with that shit.

49:45.748 --> 49:47.583
Come sit with us. Sit down.

49:49.251 --> 49:52.219
Maci, do we not love
our customers for real?

49:52.221 --> 49:56.159
Oh my God, they are the best.
They are the best. Hand to God.

49:56.592 --> 49:59.492
You know,
I used to work

49:59.494 --> 50:02.031
at a pricey-ass steakhouse
where we had some

50:02.398 --> 50:04.534
real a-hole customers there
but the difference is,

50:04.800 --> 50:09.005
I couldn't throw those customers
out. Oh. I love these.

50:18.380 --> 50:21.518
Okay. He asked about the money,
didn't he?

50:21.784 --> 50:23.619
No. What money?

50:24.286 --> 50:26.489
- Car wash money.
- What about it?

50:27.289 --> 50:28.391
What?

50:29.592 --> 50:31.191
He said you didn't
tell him about the break-in

50:31.193 --> 50:32.728
and that's grounds
for termination,

50:33.161 --> 50:34.662
so I should fill out
this paperwork

50:34.664 --> 50:36.533
and have it ready
for him to sign.

50:37.867 --> 50:39.700
Oh, no, please.
Don't, don't do that.

50:39.702 --> 50:41.534
Today is not the day
to provoke him.

50:41.536 --> 50:43.436
Believe me, you know I know
how to keep my mouth shut

50:43.438 --> 50:45.606
and be the original
No Drama girl,

50:45.608 --> 50:48.876
but he can't fire you and I want
to call bullshit.

50:48.878 --> 50:50.344
Let him have his tantrum.

50:50.346 --> 50:52.412
Then he says if Mark goes
to G.M.

50:52.414 --> 50:55.349
do I wanna train as a manager?
Which, did you tell him

50:55.351 --> 50:57.454
I was asking
about the racial policy?

50:57.652 --> 51:00.287
Because I don't appreciate him
trying to blow smoke up my ass

51:00.289 --> 51:01.688
- like that.
- No, listen. He's, he's

51:01.690 --> 51:03.523
he's not blowing smoke.

51:03.525 --> 51:06.762
Well you're not leaving.
You're married to this place.

51:07.864 --> 51:10.733
No.

51:16.438 --> 51:18.574
- Sorry.
- You losing your mind?

51:21.911 --> 51:25.248
Listen, I started this day off
crying, so, if you ask me,

51:25.614 --> 51:27.650
- laughing is progress.
- Uh-huh.

51:28.251 --> 51:29.519
Then you know what comes next,
right?

51:29.784 --> 51:31.452
- What?
- Screaming,

51:31.454 --> 51:33.256
and freaking the fuck out.

51:33.556 --> 51:34.858
That sounds good, too!

51:38.360 --> 51:41.597
Come get silly with us.

52:02.418 --> 52:04.418
My mom's a bigger fan
of Steph than I am,

52:04.420 --> 52:06.255
that's the funny part. But
she's gonna freak about this.

52:06.688 --> 52:08.524
Well, I'd say come crash
with me but...

52:09.625 --> 52:11.193
roommate situation, huh?

52:11.661 --> 52:12.892
Mm-hmm.

52:12.894 --> 52:14.431
She's a bigger buzzkill
than your mom.

52:14.963 --> 52:16.766
Did you just compare
your wife to my mom?

52:17.699 --> 52:20.833
That's fuckin' creepshow, dude.
And put your ring back on.

52:20.835 --> 52:22.404
That is so disrespectful.

52:22.605 --> 52:24.474
Oh, no-no-no, she's cool.
She's cool. She's...

52:24.873 --> 52:25.808
My wife is great.

52:26.643 --> 52:28.345
She keeps...
she keeps me in check...

52:28.978 --> 52:30.778
you know? Plus she likes
playing video games.

52:30.780 --> 52:31.979
I like playing video games.

52:31.981 --> 52:33.680
Mm-hmm.
- You know?

52:33.682 --> 52:35.316
She has good taste in women too.

52:35.318 --> 52:37.821
She, like, just
a wonderful person all around.

52:42.592 --> 52:44.260
- Danyelle?
- Yeah?

52:47.797 --> 52:53.235
Hey, uh... listen, um...
you know...

52:54.402 --> 52:57.373
all I wanted to do today
was just one good thing.

52:57.639 --> 53:01.008
No, I... I didn't think
we'd get away with it,

53:01.010 --> 53:02.412
but maybe we did.

53:11.019 --> 53:14.190
- Mm-hmm.
- So, I'm happy.

53:14.923 --> 53:16.358
You know? I mean,

53:16.759 --> 53:18.594
truth is I thought
we'd get caught.

53:19.728 --> 53:22.362
So, I'm just thinking, you know.
I'm sorry.

53:22.364 --> 53:23.799
I'm just thinking out loud,
but...

53:25.467 --> 53:28.601
if he offered you a job,
a promotion and a raise

53:28.603 --> 53:30.737
- that you could use...
- We'll see if he's serious

53:30.739 --> 53:33.976
- when someone actually leaves.
- No, no, what I'm saying is...

53:35.510 --> 53:37.610
today could go from good
to great

53:37.612 --> 53:38.815
as far as I'm concerned.

53:39.315 --> 53:41.684
I don't know
what you're trying to say?

53:43.719 --> 53:45.952
I guess I'm just saying
how many times can you fire

53:45.954 --> 53:49.759
a lady before...
before she gets the message?

53:55.630 --> 53:56.565
Yeah.

53:58.467 --> 53:59.402
I'm done.

54:04.907 --> 54:06.706
Screw it. I'm gonna call it
a day for real.

54:06.708 --> 54:08.477
Maybe hang out
with my husband for a change.

54:08.744 --> 54:10.344
Y'all don't need a manager
anyway,

54:10.346 --> 54:11.648
look at how well-oiled
a machine this is.

54:12.380 --> 54:13.549
You're leaving?

54:14.750 --> 54:17.420
Yeah. Yeah. I'm, uh...

54:21.389 --> 54:24.691
Jennelle, you watch
and you learn from the master.

54:24.693 --> 54:25.894
There's an art to this.

54:40.443 --> 54:42.409
My name is Lisa,
I'm the general manager.

54:42.411 --> 54:43.711
Are we taking good care
of you today?

54:43.713 --> 54:44.614
Yeah.

54:45.681 --> 54:46.949
Anything we could be doing
to improve our service?

54:47.682 --> 54:49.552
Um, are the TV's broken
or something?

54:50.652 --> 54:52.720
We are working on that
right now and they should

54:52.722 --> 54:54.524
be back up in time
for the fight tonight.

54:54.757 --> 54:56.389
- Okay.
- Y'all should stick around.

54:56.391 --> 54:58.260
- It's a pretty good time here.
- Oh, thanks.

55:11.139 --> 55:12.608
Just get in and go.

55:13.809 --> 55:14.811
Just get in and go.

55:21.150 --> 55:22.985
Oh, shit.

55:27.123 --> 55:30.827
Okay, God, please.
Please, please.

55:34.130 --> 55:35.398
Thank you.

55:40.735 --> 55:44.406
Shit.

56:04.126 --> 56:05.495
Oh.

56:05.760 --> 56:08.965
That's it!
Oh, wait, no. Oh...

56:09.931 --> 56:12.368
God, this is how I got
in trouble in the first place.

56:12.802 --> 56:13.670
Okay.

56:14.670 --> 56:16.202
All right, come here.
You know I can't resist.

56:16.204 --> 56:17.574
Come here. Come here.

56:20.074 --> 56:21.510
You can't go.

56:22.210 --> 56:24.510
Come on, this ain't goodbye,
you know that.

56:24.512 --> 56:26.646
And maybe, maybe you can
take me out this weekend.

56:26.648 --> 56:29.048
You know, you could finally
take me to one of those bars

56:29.050 --> 56:32.186
- that I'm way too old for.
- That would be amazing!

56:32.188 --> 56:34.958
Uh-huh. Finally introduce me
to that mysterious boyfriend.

56:39.128 --> 56:40.961
I should probably tell you
that I'm dating

56:40.963 --> 56:41.931
Professor Doherty.

56:43.898 --> 56:44.800
Oh...

56:46.969 --> 56:50.974
Yeah, uh, everybody knows.
I'm sorry. I just...

56:51.873 --> 56:54.007
I knew that you wouldn't like it
and I didn't wanna hurt

56:54.009 --> 56:55.175
your feelings or anything.

56:55.177 --> 56:56.012
But...

56:57.947 --> 57:00.717
I always loved
how you wanted to protect me.

57:01.250 --> 57:03.652
And you were the best manager
ever. Okay?

57:04.119 --> 57:05.021
Sure.

57:42.757 --> 57:43.725
Cameron?

57:47.195 --> 57:48.530
Lisa?

57:49.632 --> 57:51.764
- Oh, hey. You're still here.
- Oh my gosh, the money.

57:51.766 --> 57:53.166
That was insane.

57:53.168 --> 57:55.672
Thank you, times, like,
a fricking million.

57:56.038 --> 57:57.905
- Seriously, my heart melted.
- Oh.

57:57.907 --> 58:01.208
And Cameron, he was so sweet
to me, too. He, um, he just left

58:01.210 --> 58:02.775
but he told me

58:02.777 --> 58:04.713
that you could keep
the computer.

58:05.581 --> 58:08.615
But he also,
um, took some of his clothes

58:08.617 --> 58:09.853
and stuff, so...

58:12.054 --> 58:14.253
Chris, this is Lisa, my boss.

58:14.255 --> 58:16.259
Who basically saved my life
today.

58:20.061 --> 58:20.996
We've met.

58:24.266 --> 58:26.800
All right, well, um, we're gonna
get out of your way.

58:26.802 --> 58:28.872
Chris just, uh, came by
to pick me up.

58:29.771 --> 58:32.104
But I, uh...
I seriously think I would

58:32.106 --> 58:34.675
have completely lost my shit
today if you hadn't helped me

58:34.677 --> 58:36.646
out and let me get my head
together.

58:37.012 --> 58:39.880
And I owe you huge. I, I...

58:39.882 --> 58:41.951
I don't know what
I could ever do, but, um...

58:56.364 --> 58:58.200
Leave that money here, Shaina.

59:03.938 --> 59:04.973
Leave it here.

59:06.041 --> 59:08.244
- What do you mean, leave it...
- I don't think so.

59:09.844 --> 59:13.148
I will break your other leg.
I do not give a fuck right now.

59:13.849 --> 59:15.117
Do you want to test me?

59:21.322 --> 59:24.027
It was very nice of you
to raise the money for us.

59:24.293 --> 59:25.391
For her.

59:25.393 --> 59:26.959
We really appreciate it.

59:26.961 --> 59:28.264
- For her!
- Right. Look, I get it.

59:28.697 --> 59:31.067
Okay. I do, but Lisa...

59:31.800 --> 59:35.235
This is for me, okay.
This was my responsibility.

59:35.237 --> 59:37.606
I acted completely
out of control.

59:37.806 --> 59:39.805
Ambulance,
emergency room.

59:39.807 --> 59:41.374
We're not blowing this shit
on Prada.

59:41.376 --> 59:42.809
- Straight bills.
- Like I said,

59:42.811 --> 59:44.110
this is my responsibility, okay.

59:44.112 --> 59:45.315
- Mine.
- Put the money down, Shaina.

59:47.115 --> 59:49.018
- I love you, very much.
- I love you.

59:50.686 --> 59:51.721
Put the money down.

59:56.858 --> 59:58.827
I think it's kind of fucked up
if you ask me.

59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.061
If you really think
that helping someone

01:00:01.063 --> 01:00:02.765
means you get to tell them
how to live their life.

01:00:03.699 --> 01:00:05.331
And look, we're not...
we're not at Double Whammies

01:00:05.333 --> 01:00:07.002
anymore, okay? This, this is...

01:00:07.302 --> 01:00:09.606
you're not my manager.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.907
Did I ask you for relationship
advice? Like, for real?

01:00:13.909 --> 01:00:15.374
- It's okay.
- Did I ask you

01:00:15.376 --> 01:00:18.313
- for relationship advice?
- It's okay. Thank you.

01:00:26.722 --> 01:00:29.121
Give me! Get the fuck out!

01:00:29.123 --> 01:00:32.160
You crazy bitch!
You're fucking psycho!

01:00:33.728 --> 01:00:35.330
God damn!

01:00:36.398 --> 01:00:38.034
Fuck you!

01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:49.746
Thanks for your help, Lisa.

01:01:44.065 --> 01:01:45.834
- Hey, Arturo.
- Hey.

01:01:48.503 --> 01:01:49.838
Thanks for coming.

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:56.846
Uh... you must have known
the safe code, right?

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:02.918
- Yeah.
- Okay. I want a favor.

01:02:04.552 --> 01:02:06.855
I want you to take my key.
I'll give you this.

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:14.097
You go, and you put this money
back in the safe. All right?

01:02:14.496 --> 01:02:17.130
Nobody'll know the difference.
I seriously doubt someone's

01:02:17.132 --> 01:02:19.034
gonna watch a video to see
who's putting money in.

01:02:20.835 --> 01:02:23.839
But, if you're worried about it,
you know, I, I...

01:02:25.306 --> 01:02:27.142
I cut eye holes
in my husband's winter cap.

01:02:27.576 --> 01:02:29.344
It's not a ski mask, but...

01:02:37.251 --> 01:02:38.420
We agree you owe me, right?

01:02:40.454 --> 01:02:41.423
Yeah.

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:46.461
Yeah.

01:02:48.329 --> 01:02:49.364
All right.

01:02:50.431 --> 01:02:51.933
You can always put me down
as a reference, okay?

01:02:53.302 --> 01:02:54.202
Okay.

01:02:57.306 --> 01:03:00.076
- Take care of that family.
- I will.

01:03:01.876 --> 01:03:02.778
Thank you.

01:03:03.612 --> 01:03:09.018
Sure.

01:03:39.414 --> 01:03:42.048
Well, I actually think
the girls would prefer it,

01:03:42.050 --> 01:03:45.117
is the thing. You know,
all the big chains do it, Cubby.

01:03:45.119 --> 01:03:47.589
You check into your shift
and you get a grade, right?

01:03:47.989 --> 01:03:50.657
Hair, four out of five.
Make-up, five out of five.

01:03:50.659 --> 01:03:53.829
Weight, two out of whatever,
you know?

01:03:54.128 --> 01:03:56.898
Like, does that suck? Yeah.
You know, I'm sure it does.

01:03:57.331 --> 01:04:00.367
But it's way better
than it is now where I've got

01:04:00.369 --> 01:04:04.104
to find a moment and pull
a girl aside and be like:

01:04:04.106 --> 01:04:07.210
"Hey, Becky, you look like
shit today." You know?

01:04:07.476 --> 01:04:10.075
Which seems way more personal
and it shouldn't

01:04:10.077 --> 01:04:12.144
because it's got nothing to do
with you, right?

01:04:12.146 --> 01:04:13.545
It's got nothing to do with me.

01:04:13.547 --> 01:04:16.148
Hey, um,
what's going on with Krista?

01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:18.520
Lisa fired her then invited her
to hang out and drink.

01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:22.088
That makes sense... okay.
Um, what's the new girl's name?

01:04:22.090 --> 01:04:23.690
Jennelle.
She just jumped in to help out.

01:04:23.692 --> 01:04:25.460
Y'all still gotta do paperwork
on her.

01:04:25.693 --> 01:04:29.396
Paperwork, okay. Hey, Cubby,
have you heard her idea

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:31.430
about renting the girls out
for private parties?

01:04:31.432 --> 01:04:33.166
She's got a lot of energy.

01:04:33.168 --> 01:04:35.070
Danyelle, are people staying
or are they leaving?

01:04:35.503 --> 01:04:37.239
Some bailed,
but we're holding it down.

01:04:38.039 --> 01:04:39.641
All right.
Well, I'm about a minute away.

01:04:40.474 --> 01:04:41.877
Mark, hand me the wire cutters.

01:04:42.177 --> 01:04:44.177
Yeah.

01:04:44.179 --> 01:04:45.514
Orange handle.

01:04:45.713 --> 01:04:48.581
Well, I'll tell you what,
first rule

01:04:48.583 --> 01:04:50.383
of management training,
get ready to deal

01:04:50.385 --> 01:04:51.320
with some crazy.

01:04:52.586 --> 01:04:54.720
But seriously, what do you think
about this private party idea?

01:04:54.722 --> 01:04:56.990
I mean, we could send the girls
in uniform, you know.

01:04:56.992 --> 01:04:58.060
Liven a place up?

01:04:58.293 --> 01:04:59.662
Liability nightmare.

01:05:00.128 --> 01:05:02.061
But what if we figure out
how to market, right, to, like,

01:05:02.063 --> 01:05:03.398
- frat parties?
- Terrible idea.

01:05:03.597 --> 01:05:04.965
It's a liability.

01:05:05.733 --> 01:05:07.402
These kids grew up whacking
off to their cell phones. I mean...

01:05:07.601 --> 01:05:09.202
Hey, guys, they probably need me
back on the floor right now.

01:05:09.204 --> 01:05:10.503
All right.
Hey, Danyelle, let me ask you

01:05:10.505 --> 01:05:11.941
- a question... Danyelle?
- Yeah?

01:05:14.041 --> 01:05:15.244
You like working here, right?

01:05:17.612 --> 01:05:18.581
Yeah...

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:24.383
All right, now who is rooting
for Machado?

01:05:24.385 --> 01:05:26.922
This, this is crappy.

01:05:27.155 --> 01:05:28.691
We got some fans in here!

01:05:29.324 --> 01:05:32.427
Oh, hey, come on in. Come on in.
Don't be shy.

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:35.431
Just a little pre-show here
before the fight comes on.

01:05:35.731 --> 01:05:38.668
All right y'all, who is like me?

01:05:39.333 --> 01:05:42.137
Who doesn't care who wins
or who loses

01:05:42.471 --> 01:05:46.673
as long as it's a frigging
brutal, bloody battle?

01:05:46.675 --> 01:05:49.476
Woo! Hell yeah!

01:05:49.478 --> 01:05:53.648
- All right.
- Okay, um... Okay.

01:05:54.248 --> 01:05:58.553
Okay. I think maybe it's time for
a little Double-Whammies toast.

01:05:58.753 --> 01:06:04.460
Jennelle... thank you.
Whoa, that is heavy!

01:06:04.726 --> 01:06:06.595
- I love you!
- Come on.

01:06:07.661 --> 01:06:12.567
Oh my gosh, that is perfection,
okay. So...

01:06:13.235 --> 01:06:15.501
before we fire up these TV's

01:06:15.503 --> 01:06:17.272
and get to see the men
being men,

01:06:17.806 --> 01:06:20.572
I say we take a little minute
to appreciate

01:06:20.574 --> 01:06:22.677
what makes Double Whammies
so special...

01:06:23.512 --> 01:06:27.213
women being women!

01:06:27.215 --> 01:06:28.584
And not being bitches!

01:06:29.418 --> 01:06:31.550
Ah, let's hear it
for your gorgeous servers,

01:06:31.552 --> 01:06:34.456
everyone!

01:06:35.257 --> 01:06:37.657
Yes, let me hear it
even louder!

01:06:37.659 --> 01:06:40.126
Come on, make some noise!

01:06:40.128 --> 01:06:42.398
Your servers,
they are so hot! Woo!

01:06:42.597 --> 01:06:44.333
Turn on the damn fight.

01:06:44.733 --> 01:06:47.003
Oh, okay. Good things come
to those who wait.

01:06:47.402 --> 01:06:49.637
We're still celebrating up here,
right?

01:06:50.405 --> 01:06:54.777
Uh, y'all, I just want to take
this time to shout out

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:58.047
our general manager.
Her last day was today.

01:06:58.246 --> 01:07:00.215
A lot of you know her.
Her name is Lisa.

01:07:00.782 --> 01:07:03.682
- God damn it...
- For serious. For serious.

01:07:03.684 --> 01:07:08.387
Um, wrap your hand
around a Big Ass, beer, that is

01:07:08.389 --> 01:07:11.291
and raise it high to Lisa!

01:07:11.293 --> 01:07:14.626
Because she is the best manager
a place like this ever had,

01:07:14.628 --> 01:07:17.197
and it makes such a difference

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:20.266
when your boss really cares
about you. You know?

01:07:20.268 --> 01:07:22.334
And let me just say
it makes such a difference

01:07:22.336 --> 01:07:24.440
when she really cares
about the customers too,

01:07:24.706 --> 01:07:26.409
am I right?

01:07:26.608 --> 01:07:27.510
Lisa!

01:07:27.708 --> 01:07:29.342
That is what I'm talking about!

01:07:29.344 --> 01:07:31.276
Yes!

01:07:31.278 --> 01:07:33.579
<i>Come for the ribs,
stay for all the rest...</i>

01:07:33.581 --> 01:07:35.116
- To Lisa!
- <i>...at The Mancave.</i>

01:07:36.418 --> 01:07:38.186
- <i>Where a man can be a man.</i>
- Yeah, all right!

01:07:43.224 --> 01:07:45.594
Come on, Machado!

01:07:46.293 --> 01:07:48.364
- Knock his ass out!
- ...Machado's head.

01:07:48.896 --> 01:07:51.764
Oh, yeah. There you go!
There you go!

01:07:51.766 --> 01:07:53.398
Come on! Come on!

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.900
- There you go!
- Get in there.

01:07:54.902 --> 01:07:56.503
- Kick, kick, kick!
- Come on, go!

01:07:56.505 --> 01:07:57.804
Get in there.

01:07:57.806 --> 01:07:59.706
- Move! Move!
- Come on!

01:07:59.708 --> 01:08:01.608
<i>I still think
it happened from that</i>

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:03.178
- <i>initial head-butt before...</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:08:10.784 --> 01:08:12.788
Damn! I think that woke him up!

01:08:14.322 --> 01:08:16.125
You can just shake
that thing someplace else.

01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:18.225
I'm just here for the burger
and the fight.

01:08:18.658 --> 01:08:19.560
Okay.

01:08:24.599 --> 01:08:27.301
- Damn good... All right.
- All right.

01:08:27.502 --> 01:08:29.768
<i>The right hand right in the temple.</i>

01:08:29.770 --> 01:08:31.370
Oh, yeah!

01:08:31.372 --> 01:08:32.807
<i>He landed that nice shot.</i>

01:08:33.675 --> 01:08:34.841
Yeah!

01:08:35.475 --> 01:08:37.278
<i>You think about
all the awards that...</i>

01:08:39.514 --> 01:08:41.380
Hey, be nice to Dave

01:08:41.381 --> 01:08:43.652
because his pussy's real sore
right now.

01:08:48.923 --> 01:08:51.460
Hey, congrats on the promotion.

01:08:52.792 --> 01:08:53.761
Thanks.

01:08:56.363 --> 01:08:57.332
Sorry...

01:08:58.332 --> 01:08:59.835
<i>...And Machado with a left.</i>

01:09:19.854 --> 01:09:20.756
Arturo?

01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:44.578
"You like working here, right?"

01:09:50.917 --> 01:09:55.456
Drink! New girl. Hi.
Can I get another drink?

01:09:56.423 --> 01:09:57.326
Hey, Mace?

01:09:58.126 --> 01:09:59.228
One second, handsome.
Yeah, babe?

01:10:00.462 --> 01:10:02.464
What do you think Lisa would say
if I broke rule number one?

01:10:04.498 --> 01:10:05.701
I think you're a manager now.

01:10:06.701 --> 01:10:08.337
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:19.713 --> 01:10:21.382
Turn on the TV!

01:10:21.783 --> 01:10:24.286
The TV's out!

01:10:24.519 --> 01:10:26.755
- The TVs out!
- All right!

01:10:27.055 --> 01:10:28.090
Let's have some fun!

01:10:29.056 --> 01:10:32.625
What the eff, y'all?
That is not supposed to happen.

01:10:32.627 --> 01:10:33.960
No shit, it's not supposed
to happen!

01:10:33.962 --> 01:10:35.531
Totally! No!

01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:37.865
Get your ass off the bar,
please!

01:10:38.533 --> 01:10:40.369
You can shake it first, though.

01:10:41.936 --> 01:10:42.902
- Do what? No! Everyone, hold on. Hold on you all.
- TV, TV...

01:10:42.904 --> 01:10:45.405
- TV! TV! TV!
- No the pre-show is over.

01:10:45.407 --> 01:10:48.974
That's right! That's right.
The pre-show is over!

01:10:48.976 --> 01:10:51.247
Now it's time
for the main event.

01:10:51.546 --> 01:10:53.079
- Come on, man.
- Come on, come up here.

01:10:53.081 --> 01:10:55.851
Jay's gonna come, help us out.

01:10:56.417 --> 01:10:58.017
Get up there, Jay!

01:10:58.019 --> 01:11:00.389
- Come on. Okay everybody.
- Jay, Jay!

01:11:00.755 --> 01:11:02.391
- Mark!
- Before you murder us

01:11:02.590 --> 01:11:05.625
you should know that the owner,
Mr. Cubby is working hard

01:11:05.627 --> 01:11:07.326
to get the cable back up.

01:11:07.328 --> 01:11:09.495
It's so important to him
that y'all don't go crazy

01:11:09.497 --> 01:11:11.397
and destroy his restaurant.

01:11:11.399 --> 01:11:14.433
All right now this is one of our
favorite customers, Jay,

01:11:14.435 --> 01:11:16.568
from over at Sounds Town

01:11:16.570 --> 01:11:19.839
and now he's gonna shake
his ass.

01:11:19.841 --> 01:11:21.944
No. No, actually, he's not!

01:11:25.412 --> 01:11:26.845
Wait, wait.

01:11:26.847 --> 01:11:28.050
We're gonna get
everything back on.

01:11:28.449 --> 01:11:32.552
Jay, you gotta put this on!
Oh my god!

01:11:32.554 --> 01:11:33.952
- Bullshit!
- Come on.

01:11:33.954 --> 01:11:36.625
Yeah, take it off!

01:11:37.759 --> 01:11:38.926
Oh, my God!

01:11:39.394 --> 01:11:41.030
I'm coming up.
I'm coming up.

01:11:41.563 --> 01:11:43.763
- We're missing the fight?
- We'll have it on in a minute.

01:11:43.765 --> 01:11:46.465
- What's happening?
- We appreciate you guys' patience.

01:11:46.467 --> 01:11:48.804
We're doing our best to get
the TVs back on, so...

01:11:49.002 --> 01:11:51.506
Hey, if you're gonna be a
manager, I need you to help me!

01:11:51.773 --> 01:11:53.505
I'm sorry, Mark.

01:11:53.507 --> 01:11:55.441
Oh, my God! You girls
are not nearly hot enough

01:11:55.443 --> 01:11:57.313
to pull of this kind
of bullshit!

01:11:58.747 --> 01:12:00.949
I think
you should apologize.

01:12:01.682 --> 01:12:02.915
Mace. Mace.

01:12:02.917 --> 01:12:04.616
Dude, do not get into it
with her.

01:12:04.618 --> 01:12:06.052
- I didn't say it!
- Yeah, I heard you.

01:12:06.054 --> 01:12:07.620
Yeah, I would like an apology,
actually.

01:12:07.622 --> 01:12:08.787
For saying you're not hot
enough?

01:12:08.789 --> 01:12:10.522
I need you to de-escalate okay.

01:12:10.524 --> 01:12:11.924
- I don't like it.
- I'm a lover, not a fighter,

01:12:11.926 --> 01:12:13.429
and I don't want to do
either with you.

01:12:13.694 --> 01:12:18.032
Uh-huh. Sonny, I am
twice the man you are.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:21.537
And twice the woman
you will ever screw.

01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:24.039
Give it up for Bobo, y'all.

01:12:24.506 --> 01:12:26.938
Only one around here
standing up for us.

01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:29.509
Whoo!

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:30.643
Bobo!

01:12:30.645 --> 01:12:32.881
Yeah, it's Bobo, thank you.

01:12:36.184 --> 01:12:38.753
Hey, lover boy, come here!

01:12:40.521 --> 01:12:42.455
All right, let's go. You're out.
Come on.

01:12:42.457 --> 01:12:43.492
Don't you touch me!

01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:47.829
Hey, why don't y'all meet me out
in the parking lot.

01:12:50.532 --> 01:12:53.402
Hey, what about this guy?
He's being a prick!

01:12:53.667 --> 01:12:56.838
Fuck it, I'm manager too!
You're out, sir.

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:00.042
Okay, I guess I'm outta here.

01:13:00.809 --> 01:13:03.075
- See you later.
- Yep, that's it. Right there.

01:13:03.077 --> 01:13:04.146
Out the door!

01:13:13.755 --> 01:13:15.724
Cubby, let's go!

01:13:16.690 --> 01:13:18.159
- I can help.
- Yes! Please!

01:13:18.659 --> 01:13:20.893
And get off the damn bar,
we're about five seconds

01:13:20.895 --> 01:13:22.695
from getting shut down here.
Come on.

01:13:22.697 --> 01:13:23.966
I don't work here.

01:13:24.198 --> 01:13:25.897
Exactly. Tarzan Barbie,
get off the bar.

01:13:25.899 --> 01:13:27.568
- Let's go!
- Bullshit!

01:13:33.707 --> 01:13:39.144
Eyes up here, guys! Hi!
I'm Jennelle, I'm new here...

01:13:39.146 --> 01:13:41.246
- Uh I can see your titty.
- I'm really looking forward

01:13:41.248 --> 01:13:43.883
- to getting to know you guys.
- Sweetheart?

01:13:43.885 --> 01:13:48.891
And partying with you,
Double Whammy style! All right.

01:13:49.090 --> 01:13:52.961
Boom. So, let's be really good
little boys...

01:13:53.194 --> 01:13:55.227
- That does not...
- No, no. She's new. She's new!

01:13:55.229 --> 01:13:57.597
- And Mommy is gonna make...
- Get down from there, Miss!

01:13:57.599 --> 01:13:59.601
- Okay. Sorry.
- Gentlemen,

01:14:00.033 --> 01:14:03.169
we're calling it a night.
Just head out the doors, now.

01:14:03.171 --> 01:14:06.875
Aw, man. What!
Aw, what!

01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:09.008
Keep moving, people.
Keep moving.

01:14:09.010 --> 01:14:10.212
He sneak out back?

01:14:15.984 --> 01:14:18.284
It's back on! It's back on!
Come on in, guys!

01:14:18.286 --> 01:14:21.286
Hey! I said clear out, now.
Everybody!

01:14:21.288 --> 01:14:24.126
Party's over. Get the fuck out!

01:14:27.127 --> 01:14:28.628
What's happening here
is inappropriate,

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:29.998
you understand?
That's inappropriate.

01:14:30.198 --> 01:14:32.031
Do you understand
what's happening here?

01:14:32.033 --> 01:14:33.766
- Yeah.
- Do you understand me?

01:14:33.768 --> 01:14:35.671
- It's not that type of...
- He's just stupid.

01:14:36.938 --> 01:14:38.870
Okay, hey, hey!
All right, all right!

01:14:38.872 --> 01:14:41.240
Come on stop, stop! Okay!
What's the matter with you?

01:14:41.242 --> 01:14:42.942
Get the fuck out,
I'm being serious!

01:14:42.944 --> 01:14:44.309
Everybody get the fuck out
right now, let's go!

01:14:44.311 --> 01:14:46.144
- Come on, outside.
- Let's go,

01:14:46.146 --> 01:14:48.046
bring your fuckin' ass in,
what's the matter with you, huh?

01:14:48.048 --> 01:14:49.951
Get your drunk ass out of here
right now!

01:14:51.886 --> 01:14:54.056
<i>It's... it's a tough
call on this knockdown.</i>

01:14:54.288 --> 01:14:56.224
<i>You can see it, clips of...</i>

01:14:57.893 --> 01:15:00.662
<i>As he comes back and kinda looks
like his legs buckle under him.</i>

01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:04.629
<i>A little bit of controversy
for sure.</i>

01:15:04.631 --> 01:15:06.132
<i>Yeah, well, it all came down
to that knockdown</i>

01:15:06.134 --> 01:15:08.334
<i>but there was a lot
of good exchanges</i>

01:15:08.336 --> 01:15:09.872
<i>uh, happening both ways.</i>

01:15:11.105 --> 01:15:12.541
<i>The cut on Machado's head
from that head butt,</i>

01:15:13.841 --> 01:15:15.775
<i>but Machado did a good job
at really coming forward</i>

01:15:15.777 --> 01:15:17.512
<i>and there was that</i>

01:15:17.811 --> 01:15:19.914
<i>constant pressure
of throwing hooks and...</i>

01:15:20.247 --> 01:15:21.782
Want me to Big Ass
that for you?

01:15:22.617 --> 01:15:24.152
<i>...moving those punches over...</i>

01:15:35.296 --> 01:15:40.969
Okay, um, Claire, Amber,
Chantelle, and Ilona.

01:15:48.242 --> 01:15:49.610
It's right in there.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:15:59.688
Lisa?

01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:03.824
- Okay. Hey.
- Hello.

01:16:06.094 --> 01:16:07.793
I've been meaning
to check out

01:16:07.795 --> 01:16:09.128
the local competition,
but I just haven't had a chance

01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:10.795
- to swing by yet.
- Um, yeah.

01:16:10.797 --> 01:16:12.130
No, it's a nice place,
a lot of good people.

01:16:12.132 --> 01:16:13.699
Where are you from?

01:16:13.701 --> 01:16:15.267
Well, I'm based in Nashville.
Sort of.

01:16:15.269 --> 01:16:17.102
Um, I haven't spent much time
at home lately,

01:16:17.104 --> 01:16:19.104
sort of traveling from city
to city getting all these

01:16:19.106 --> 01:16:20.775
- locations set up.
- Road warrior.

01:16:21.676 --> 01:16:23.779
Yeah, but I love it. I do.

01:16:25.012 --> 01:16:26.314
Okay, look, this, this is great.

01:16:26.747 --> 01:16:28.916
I clearly don't need to explain
the concept to you.

01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:30.750
Boobs, brews, and big-screens.

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:35.286
Bam! That's... that's good!
That's good.

01:16:35.288 --> 01:16:38.893
Three B's. Three B's.
Triple B's.

01:16:39.894 --> 01:16:41.727
You know, I almost want
to send this to marketing,

01:16:41.729 --> 01:16:43.428
but then I'm thinking, you know,
like, does it have

01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:45.366
to be triple D's?

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:48.134
Although I will say our strategy
is moving, you know,

01:16:48.136 --> 01:16:50.201
sort of away from boobs
and into butts.

01:16:50.203 --> 01:16:51.773
- Oh, wow.
- There's still a B.

01:16:52.372 --> 01:16:54.342
- Right? Yeah.
- And there it is.

01:16:55.143 --> 01:16:57.009
So, uh, you know,
I have to ask,

01:16:57.011 --> 01:16:59.778
um, why did you leave
Double Whammies?

01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:02.714
Oh, sure, sure, of course.
Uh, well, it just came down

01:17:02.716 --> 01:17:04.884
to some disagreements
between me and the owner,

01:17:04.886 --> 01:17:06.317
you know. I will say, for me,

01:17:06.319 --> 01:17:07.922
I know we're
in the entertainment industry

01:17:08.122 --> 01:17:09.289
and for us things
are a little different.

01:17:10.091 --> 01:17:14.059
Uh, but for me, top priorities,
always respecting our girls

01:17:14.061 --> 01:17:15.631
and respecting our customers.

01:17:16.163 --> 01:17:18.798
Totally, and that is so great
to hear you say.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.433
You know, one of the things
that I love about working

01:17:20.435 --> 01:17:23.169
at Mancave is that we've...
we've built this,

01:17:23.171 --> 01:17:27.272
this super well-thought-out
culture of respect, you know.

01:17:27.274 --> 01:17:29.075
We have a whole team
of attorneys who are paid

01:17:29.077 --> 01:17:31.043
a crazy amount of money
to make sure that they lay

01:17:31.045 --> 01:17:32.977
that out super clearly.
There's a rule-book

01:17:32.979 --> 01:17:35.147
that everyone gets. You know,
that way we're not leaving it

01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:37.653
to the girls to think about it
too much themselves.

01:17:38.252 --> 01:17:40.251
You know? And, I mean,
as you well know,

01:17:40.253 --> 01:17:44.824
one of the joys and,
and challenges of our concept

01:17:44.826 --> 01:17:47.960
is that most of the workforce
is young girls.

01:17:47.962 --> 01:17:51.033
Who, you know, full disclosure,
are lovely,

01:17:51.231 --> 01:17:53.402
but they are not always
brain surgeons.

01:17:53.835 --> 01:17:55.401
So, I don't know how it was
at Double Whammies,

01:17:55.403 --> 01:17:57.969
but here they just do
a, a really good job

01:17:57.971 --> 01:18:01.009
of idiot-proofing
the whole thing.

01:18:01.375 --> 01:18:04.477
You know? And I will say
because we're a national chain

01:18:04.479 --> 01:18:07.412
and we have a...
a wide pool of talent,

01:18:07.414 --> 01:18:09.784
um, it's nice
because we can turn over staff

01:18:09.984 --> 01:18:12.817
very quickly, if we need to.
And look, I mean, the girls,

01:18:12.819 --> 01:18:14.919
the girls get it, right?
One of the first things

01:18:14.921 --> 01:18:17.156
we tell them when they walk
in the door is that this concept

01:18:17.158 --> 01:18:20.195
is so much bigger
than all of us.

01:18:20.528 --> 01:18:21.997
- Sure. Sure.
- Right!

01:18:22.497 --> 01:18:24.298
Hmm. It's pretty cool.

01:18:25.265 --> 01:18:26.434
- Yeah.
- Yeah,

01:18:28.069 --> 01:18:30.005
so, were you
a Double-Whammies girl?

01:18:30.938 --> 01:18:32.807
- No.
- Oh, I was a Mancave girl.

01:18:33.274 --> 01:18:35.875
- Class of '07.
- Okay, wow.

01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:36.878
- Yeah!
- That's great.

01:18:39.814 --> 01:18:40.749
Hi, Lisa!

01:18:44.252 --> 01:18:45.187
Kevin?

01:18:47.087 --> 01:18:48.155
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:18:48.523 --> 01:18:50.158
- Yes.
- This way.

01:18:53.394 --> 01:18:55.963
What are y'all doing here?
Are y'all jumping ship?

01:18:56.863 --> 01:18:57.765
We got fired.

01:18:58.766 --> 01:19:01.901
No. Dammit, Cubby.
You know, that is illegal.

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:03.835
- No, no, we deserve it.
- If y'all want to fight him...

01:19:03.837 --> 01:19:04.739
We deserve it.

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:07.141
- How?
- Long story.

01:19:08.009 --> 01:19:10.212
- It was fun, though.
- Yeah, it was fun.

01:19:12.279 --> 01:19:14.248
Basically,
we just missed you too much.

01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:17.184
Don't be mad.

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:21.253
You have a son, Danyelle.
You cannot fuck around

01:19:21.255 --> 01:19:23.091
like that, you stupid girl!
What are you...

01:19:27.461 --> 01:19:28.893
Excuse me.

01:19:28.895 --> 01:19:30.528
Okay, uh...

01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:36.003
Reagan, Maci,
Danyelle and Amber.

01:19:37.037 --> 01:19:38.973
Amber, sorry,
which Amber are you?

01:19:39.172 --> 01:19:40.539
- Johnson.
- Hi, how are you?

01:19:40.541 --> 01:19:42.441
- Johnson.
- Good luck in there.

01:19:42.443 --> 01:19:44.445
- Thank you.
- Don't even think you're on my list. Okay.

01:20:04.332 --> 01:20:08.334
Okay.
Angel, Adrianne, Layla

01:20:08.336 --> 01:20:09.805
and Rachel.

01:20:18.179 --> 01:20:19.945
Can I at least take
y'all to lunch?

01:20:19.947 --> 01:20:22.481
I know a good place nearby,
nice outdoor seating,

01:20:22.483 --> 01:20:24.319
with waiters who wear clothes.

01:20:24.618 --> 01:20:27.553
Screw that, let's go somewhere
with hot guys in Speedos.

01:20:27.555 --> 01:20:29.356
They finally open
that "Nuthuggers"?

01:20:30.257 --> 01:20:31.656
Come on.

01:20:31.658 --> 01:20:33.525
No, no, no.
You can't afford a classy place.

01:20:33.527 --> 01:20:36.264
- But we'll treat you to a drink.
- Oh, and you can afford a drink?

01:20:36.564 --> 01:20:40.435
Today I can.
Farewell gift from Krista.

01:20:43.436 --> 01:20:45.239
Maybe we could find
some outdoor seating.

01:20:50.243 --> 01:20:52.213
- I'm not gonna lecture you.
- Good.

01:20:54.681 --> 01:20:56.518
I want to though.
Believe me, I gotta...

01:20:57.284 --> 01:20:59.151
- I gotta bite my tongue on it.
- Just stuff

01:20:59.153 --> 01:21:00.121
this in your mouth.

01:21:11.698 --> 01:21:12.867
I screwed up.

01:21:15.403 --> 01:21:17.305
I screwed up. I shouldn't have
got myself fired.

01:21:20.341 --> 01:21:21.576
I'll tell y'all a secret.

01:21:23.377 --> 01:21:25.213
I come off all sweet and all
but...

01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:28.350
truth is,
I'm the most selfish of all.

01:21:28.983 --> 01:21:30.415
- That's crazy talk...
- No, I am.

01:21:30.417 --> 01:21:32.451
- ...like 50 different ways.
- I am.

01:21:32.453 --> 01:21:35.120
Yeah. No, Lisa. You're literally
the least selfish human

01:21:35.122 --> 01:21:37.425
in the world. Okay?

01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:41.929
Don't you dare feel bad
about yourself.

01:21:42.162 --> 01:21:43.594
And don't you dare
feel bad about us

01:21:43.596 --> 01:21:45.397
- for losing our shitty jobs.
- Mm.

01:21:45.399 --> 01:21:48.200
There's lots
of other shitty jobs out there,

01:21:48.202 --> 01:21:49.503
including this one.

01:21:50.171 --> 01:21:52.638
At least Maci's not dating
a customer anymore.

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.709
- Oh, God please...
- Right!

01:21:57.078 --> 01:21:59.114
Yeah.
It's as gross as you think.

01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:02.680
Um, hm, if you think
that being treated

01:22:02.682 --> 01:22:06.354
real well by a real sweet man
is gross, then...

01:22:07.654 --> 01:22:12.290
Uh-huh. This one. Yeah.
Come on, drink already. Drink.

01:22:12.292 --> 01:22:13.726
- I just drank.
- Drink!

01:22:13.728 --> 01:22:15.660
Drink! Drink!

01:22:15.662 --> 01:22:17.262
Drink! Drink! Drink!

01:22:17.264 --> 01:22:19.298
Really? Oh, my God!
Y'all frat boys now?

01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:20.235
Drink!

01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:28.576
Okay, that's it.

01:22:59.472 --> 01:23:01.609
I do love
that highway sound.

01:23:02.109 --> 01:23:03.712
The cars just driving by.

01:23:05.578 --> 01:23:08.048
I close my eyes and it's like
I'm at the beach.

01:23:08.716 --> 01:23:11.686
Your mind is wild.
You're insane.

01:23:12.485 --> 01:23:14.521
Wouldn't it be nice,
though, if we just ended up,

01:23:15.288 --> 01:23:17.222
a family again together,
just on the other side

01:23:17.224 --> 01:23:18.426
of the highway. I'd love that.

01:23:20.226 --> 01:23:21.128
Family?

01:23:23.163 --> 01:23:25.265
I don't know, like,
good friends?

01:23:25.733 --> 01:23:27.034
How about that?

01:23:29.369 --> 01:23:30.305
Yeah.

01:23:38.479 --> 01:23:40.548
Wow, you hear a lot up here.

01:23:48.456 --> 01:23:50.091
Please, don't give me
a heart attack.

01:23:52.326 --> 01:23:53.791
Oh, no, poor girl.

01:23:53.793 --> 01:23:55.693
She's just trying
to pull it together.

01:23:55.695 --> 01:23:57.731
Probably just
auditioned at The Mancave.

01:23:58.399 --> 01:24:00.264
Probably just told her
she was fat.

01:24:00.266 --> 01:24:01.633
They would not
tell her that.

01:24:01.635 --> 01:24:02.704
She'd know it, though.

01:24:04.337 --> 01:24:06.206
She doesn't look fat.

01:24:07.475 --> 01:24:11.477
It's gonna be okay!
Everything is gonna be okay!

01:24:11.479 --> 01:24:14.213
Don't tell her that,
maybe it's not gonna be okay.

01:24:14.215 --> 01:24:16.714
Maybe she just found out
she got cancer.

01:24:16.716 --> 01:24:18.549
At the Mancave audition?

01:24:18.551 --> 01:24:20.287
Yeah,
maybe they groped her up

01:24:20.488 --> 01:24:23.758
- and found a lump or something.
- Danyelle...

01:24:25.859 --> 01:24:28.295
Hey! Up here!

01:24:28.828 --> 01:24:34.536
We love you! We love you!
You can do it! Stay strong!

01:24:39.907 --> 01:24:42.543
I think I freaked her out,
she's getting back in her car.

01:24:43.243 --> 01:24:47.513
How's it go again, Danyelle?
Uh, first comes crying,

01:24:47.515 --> 01:24:49.717
then laughing,
then freaking out?

01:24:50.184 --> 01:24:53.184
Screaming.
Screaming your ass off!

01:24:53.186 --> 01:24:55.620
Yeah. No,
it's just how you deal

01:24:55.622 --> 01:24:58.425
when life keeps throwing
you bullshit.

01:24:58.626 --> 01:25:01.793
- Oh, yeah, totally.
- You wouldn't understand, Mace,

01:25:01.795 --> 01:25:03.728
you're an angel sent from Heaven

01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:06.600
to show the rest of us
what a good attitude looks like.

01:25:07.268 --> 01:25:09.735
And for lonely old men
to jerk off to.

01:25:09.737 --> 01:25:12.207
- Oh!
- God sent you here for that too.

01:25:12.506 --> 01:25:13.575
No, he didn't.

01:25:15.509 --> 01:25:16.511
No.

01:25:29.622 --> 01:25:33.525
Nah.
Nah, that's a party scream.

01:25:33.527 --> 01:25:37.364
It's supposed to be like...

01:26:13.399 --> 01:26:15.369
