I'd rather hang with <i>you.</i>

10:40.227 --> 10:43.595
But I'm grounded.
I'm not fun.

10:43.597 --> 10:47.599
I'm not gonna lie and say
I don't like to party.

10:47.601 --> 10:48.817
I do.

10:48.819 --> 10:51.069
Maybe even need to sometimes.

10:51.071 --> 10:54.406
I get it.
You want to escape.

10:54.408 --> 10:56.992
But not when I'm with you.

10:56.994 --> 11:01.263
Wow. You're good.

11:01.265 --> 11:04.166
I try to be.

11:06.169 --> 11:08.003
I should've just told you.

11:08.005 --> 11:10.088
Yes, you should've.

11:10.090 --> 11:12.007
It won't happen again.

11:12.009 --> 11:14.826
I believe you.

11:14.828 --> 11:16.878
So we're okay?

11:16.880 --> 11:18.680
<i>I wasn't sure if it was a lie,</i>

11:18.682 --> 11:20.799
<i>but I wanted it to be true.</i>

11:20.801 --> 11:23.468
Yeah. We're good.

11:23.470 --> 11:25.487
<i>I feel like being grounded</i>

11:25.489 --> 11:27.839
<i>is destroying my chances
with Sebastian.</i>

11:27.841 --> 11:30.175
It's only one more week.
That's nothing.

11:30.177 --> 11:31.476
Hello?
This is High School.

11:31.478 --> 11:33.111
Time here is like dog years in reverse.

11:33.113 --> 11:34.396
Wait.

11:34.398 --> 11:36.315
So does that mean a week is
less time than a week or more?

11:36.317 --> 11:38.400
It means time moves fast
and things change... quick.

11:38.402 --> 11:40.118
So I think you mean

11:40.120 --> 11:43.341
- it's just like dog years, period.
- Yeah, I think mouse is right

11:43.342 --> 11:44.603
because dog years
happen faster than human years.

11:44.604 --> 11:45.657
Okay, whatever, people.

11:45.659 --> 11:46.875
Let's do get bogged down
with the details.

11:46.877 --> 11:49.361
So the point is,
anything can happen in a week.

11:49.363 --> 11:50.796
And right now

11:50.798 --> 11:52.130
you and Sebastian are basically
just friends that flirt.

11:52.132 --> 11:53.882
You need to take it
to the next level, pronto.

11:53.884 --> 11:56.001
I disagree.
If he's worth it, he'll wait.

11:56.003 --> 11:58.003
But of course he won't
because guys are jerks.

11:58.005 --> 12:00.705
I know you're still upset about
Seth, and you should be, but...

12:00.707 --> 12:02.090
But you shouldn't take it out
on all guys

12:02.092 --> 12:03.759
'cause not all of us are jerks.

12:03.761 --> 12:05.477
It's true. Some of them won't
have sex with you and dump you.

12:05.479 --> 12:07.362
They just won't
have sex with you at all.

12:12.051 --> 12:14.219
Maybe we should get back
to Carrie and Sebastian.

12:14.221 --> 12:16.772
Mm! And Donna, because let's
face it, she's not gonna wait.

12:16.774 --> 12:18.607
I'm sorry, but Sebastian isn't
some kind of trophy

12:18.609 --> 12:20.992
that goes to the first person
to cross the finish line.

12:20.994 --> 12:22.077
Tell that to Donna.

12:22.079 --> 12:23.161
She thinks he's the ultimate prize,

12:23.163 --> 12:25.230
and that girl will stop at nothing.

12:25.232 --> 12:27.616
So what do I do?
I'm grounded.

12:27.618 --> 12:28.950
Your dad's still
letting you swim, right?

12:28.952 --> 12:31.086
Yeah, but, I mean...
But nothing.

12:31.088 --> 12:32.204
Invite him to the swim club.

12:32.206 --> 12:33.872
And lie to my dad again?
Mm-hmm.

12:33.874 --> 12:36.508
I think what your dad
doesn't know won't hurt him.

12:36.510 --> 12:37.759
But I'm not for lying.

12:37.761 --> 12:41.129
You cannot let that fake baking,
big-boobed bitch win.

12:41.131 --> 12:43.181
That, too.

12:44.635 --> 12:45.934
Ow!

12:45.936 --> 12:47.135
You've gotta start looking out
for you, Carrie.

12:47.137 --> 12:48.804
Nobody else is gonna do it.

12:48.806 --> 12:51.390
Is something going on
with you and Walt?

12:51.392 --> 12:53.141
What do you mean?

12:53.143 --> 12:55.477
Well... I don't want to butt in
where I don't belong,

12:55.479 --> 12:58.947
but it seems pretty clear
you and Walt haven't had sex.

12:58.949 --> 13:00.115
But you told us you...

13:00.117 --> 13:02.284
Yeah, well, I lied, okay?
We haven't.

13:02.286 --> 13:04.269
So why would you say you had?

13:04.271 --> 13:06.538
I don't know.

13:06.540 --> 13:08.106
I got embarrassed.

13:08.108 --> 13:10.125
Mouse was talking about
her and Seth, and...

13:10.127 --> 13:11.793
I've been dating Walt for two years,

13:11.795 --> 13:14.946
and we haven't, and...

13:14.948 --> 13:17.966
It's not because I don't want to.

13:17.968 --> 13:19.468
Don't you think that's weird?

13:19.470 --> 13:21.086
<i>I knew the kindest thing was to lie.</i>

13:21.088 --> 13:23.588
Well, maybe he's just waiting
for the perfect time.

13:23.590 --> 13:25.507
Maybe you're right.

13:25.509 --> 13:26.725
Timing is everything.

13:28.612 --> 13:30.628
And you should keep that in mind
with Sebastian.

13:30.630 --> 13:32.964
I mean, between being grounded
and your sister

13:32.966 --> 13:34.850
and your internship at that law firm,

13:34.852 --> 13:36.518
you don't seem like
you have time for him.

13:36.520 --> 13:38.303
Make it,

13:38.305 --> 13:40.822
or you'll regret it.

13:49.483 --> 13:51.833
You better get moving. Your bus
is gonna be outside any minute.

13:51.835 --> 13:53.168
Going.

13:53.170 --> 13:55.337
Oh, uh, did you want me to sign
that, uh, permission slip

13:55.339 --> 13:56.671
for your video class?

13:56.673 --> 13:59.824
Actually, I'm meeting Carrie
at the pool instead.

13:59.826 --> 14:00.890
If you still want to?

14:00.891 --> 14:02.468
Of course. Tomorrow
afternoon, you and me.

14:02.469 --> 14:04.045
Cool.

14:04.047 --> 14:05.347
Bye!

14:05.349 --> 14:08.016
Bye.
Okay.

14:08.018 --> 14:09.718
Ready to head into the city?

14:09.720 --> 14:12.220
Yeah, I guess.
Is everything okay?

14:12.222 --> 14:14.523
You don't seem as excited
about heading into New York

14:14.525 --> 14:16.174
as you usually do.

14:16.176 --> 14:17.526
Mm, it's just...

14:17.528 --> 14:19.010
There's a lot going on at school,

14:19.012 --> 14:21.730
and I don't want to miss stuff.

14:21.732 --> 14:24.115
Is this internship getting
in the way of your schoolwork?

14:24.117 --> 14:25.484
No. No, I can handle it.

14:25.486 --> 14:26.952
Because if... if you're
having problems,

14:26.954 --> 14:28.537
you need to talk to your teachers.

14:28.539 --> 14:30.121
Okay, just be honest with them.

14:31.575 --> 14:32.857
And the way to do that

14:32.859 --> 14:36.545
is with complete openness
and total honesty.

14:36.547 --> 14:38.163
Hello?

14:38.165 --> 14:40.465
Tom Bradshaw is not here.

14:40.467 --> 14:42.367
Ugh. Telemarketers.

14:42.369 --> 14:44.886
Yes.
Lying gets you nowhere.

14:44.888 --> 14:48.256
Well, today it's
getting you to work on time.

14:50.511 --> 14:51.977
♪ We got the beat

14:51.979 --> 14:55.146
<i>and as mush as I worried
about leaving Sebastian behind,</i>

14:55.148 --> 14:57.232
<i>right in front of me was the city.</i>

14:57.234 --> 14:59.884
♪ we got it!

14:59.886 --> 15:01.102
♪ we got the beat

15:01.104 --> 15:02.354
I'm stuck here all day.

15:02.356 --> 15:04.689
I thought you wanted to go
to century 21

15:04.691 --> 15:06.024
to buy an outfit for your date?

15:06.026 --> 15:08.159
Well, with the amount of work
I have, not a chance.

15:08.161 --> 15:10.612
Once again, I will be wearing
this on a date.

15:10.614 --> 15:12.914
No wonder I can't get laid.

15:12.916 --> 15:15.033
Uh...
You wanted to see me?

15:15.035 --> 15:17.118
I'm gonna need you to switch gears.

15:17.120 --> 15:19.204
All of these documents
need to be collated

15:19.206 --> 15:21.790
and then bound in binders.
There should be 60 of them.

15:21.792 --> 15:24.042
- And I need it by end of business today.
- Okay.

15:24.044 --> 15:25.627
Some woman with
a hoity-toity accent

15:25.629 --> 15:28.413
called here for you yesterday
like three times.

15:28.415 --> 15:32.183
Larissa Loughlin?
What did she say?

15:32.185 --> 15:33.602
"Is Carrie Bradshaw there?"

15:33.604 --> 15:36.054
- And what did you say?
- "No".

15:36.056 --> 15:37.389
Well, did you tell here
why I wasn't here?

15:37.391 --> 15:38.473
Because I was at school?

15:38.475 --> 15:40.809
Yes, I decided to spend
my very busy day

15:40.811 --> 15:43.194
talking to a complete stranger
about my High School intern.

15:43.196 --> 15:44.563
I see your point.

15:44.565 --> 15:45.763
No personal calls.

15:45.765 --> 15:48.700
Yes. Thanks for the reminder.

15:59.663 --> 16:00.996
Be useful or be gone.

16:00.998 --> 16:03.131
Larissa,
it's Carrie... Bradshaw.

16:03.133 --> 16:06.451
Darling, thank God! I need you
to get down here right now.

16:06.453 --> 16:07.669
Where is here? And why?

16:07.671 --> 16:09.087
D.U.M.B.O.

16:09.089 --> 16:11.506
As in the elephant?
As in Brooklyn.

16:11.508 --> 16:13.224
I need your bag for the photo shoot.

16:13.226 --> 16:14.792
I thought the shoot was in two weeks.

16:14.794 --> 16:16.011
Well, now it's today.

16:16.013 --> 16:18.630
We were supposed to be shooting
that darling corey.

16:18.632 --> 16:19.981
Feldman or haim?

16:19.983 --> 16:21.132
Is there a difference?

16:21.134 --> 16:23.151
Well, Haim is the one
with the soulful eyes,

16:23.153 --> 16:24.802
and feldman...
Well, whichever one it was,

16:24.804 --> 16:27.439
he's so bloody hungover,
we can't get him out of bed.

16:27.441 --> 16:30.158
He's 13.
I don't care how old he is.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.193
I cannot photograph someone
who's the color of pea soup.

16:32.195 --> 16:35.864
So... change of plans.
Enter the purse.

16:35.866 --> 16:37.265
My whole shoot revolves around it.

16:37.267 --> 16:39.501
I don't think I can
get down there today.

16:41.037 --> 16:43.622
Oh, darling, that's so disappointing.

16:43.624 --> 16:45.540
I need to go.
I have much work to do.

16:45.542 --> 16:47.792
Maybe we could
do the shoot another day?

16:47.794 --> 16:49.678
Don't be silly. Ta-ta.
Don't have a lot of time.

16:49.680 --> 16:50.879
Just wait.

16:50.881 --> 16:53.381
<i>I knew in that moment
if I let Larissa go,</i>

16:53.383 --> 16:56.134
<i>her glamorous Manhattan
would disappear from my life.</i>

16:56.136 --> 16:58.670
<i>And truth be told,
I couldn't bear that.</i>

16:58.672 --> 17:01.056
Of course. I can make it.

17:01.058 --> 17:03.391
Oh, you are brilliant.
I'm mad for you!

17:03.393 --> 17:04.693
Meet me at the pier, and, uh,

17:04.694 --> 17:06.227
now isn't soon enough.

17:06.229 --> 17:09.864
<i>They say honesty is the best policy,</i>

17:09.866 --> 17:11.566
<i>but honesty wasn't going to
get my purse</i>

17:11.568 --> 17:14.328
<i>into "Interview" magazine.</i>

17:18.395 --> 17:20.527
<i>As I tried to come up
with my escape plan...</i>

17:22.748 --> 17:24.247
Hello?

17:24.249 --> 17:25.915
Hey, Carrie. It's me.

17:25.916 --> 17:27.166
I'm sorry. Who?

17:27.169 --> 17:30.387
Uh, uh, Sebastian.
Sebastian Kydd.

17:30.389 --> 17:32.088
Oh! Hey.

17:32.090 --> 17:34.257
Sorry. Uh, bad connection.

17:34.259 --> 17:36.843
Is it cool I'm calling? I got
your work number from mouse.

17:36.845 --> 17:38.878
Yeah. No problem at all.

17:38.880 --> 17:41.348
Um, is everything okay?

17:41.350 --> 17:42.682
Yeah. Well, the thing is,

17:42.684 --> 17:45.151
there's this concert this
weekend, and I was thinking,

17:45.153 --> 17:46.653
if you're not gonna
be grounded anymore...

17:46.655 --> 17:47.687
I won't be grounded.

17:47.689 --> 17:49.089
Cool.

17:49.091 --> 17:51.408
So it's Blue Oysteyscult.
Do you like 'em?

17:51.410 --> 17:54.361
<i>I wasn't sure if he was talking
about a band or a food.</i>

17:54.363 --> 17:56.363
Love. Love.

17:56.365 --> 17:57.664
All right. Well, awesome.

17:57.666 --> 17:58.915
So they... so they have
two sets...

17:58.917 --> 18:00.283
<i>And suddenly,
my two worlds were colliding,</i>

18:00.285 --> 18:02.285
<i>and it wasn't gonna be pretty.</i>

18:02.287 --> 18:03.787
Okay, sounds great. Bye.

18:07.476 --> 18:10.844
What is it about no personal
phone calls that you don't get?

18:10.846 --> 18:12.095
Um...

18:12.097 --> 18:15.682
Actually, I was just going
through some of the files,

18:15.684 --> 18:19.769
and, um, I realized that we only
have enough to make 56 binders,

18:19.771 --> 18:21.054
and you said we need 60,

18:21.056 --> 18:23.974
so I called the printer
to see if we could get more.

18:23.976 --> 18:25.809
Crap.

18:25.811 --> 18:29.162
I guess I have to head over there.

18:30.448 --> 18:32.649
Or I could do it for you.

18:32.651 --> 18:35.151
I know you're busy today.

18:35.153 --> 18:37.037
Fine.

18:37.039 --> 18:38.955
And also stop by storage

18:38.957 --> 18:41.875
and grab the files
for the Constantine case.

18:41.877 --> 18:44.411
But remember, if you don't
finish this by tonight,

18:44.413 --> 18:46.212
I'm not signing the sheet
for your school credit,

18:46.214 --> 18:47.380
so hustle back.

18:47.382 --> 18:49.082
Of course.

18:50.384 --> 18:51.501
Wait.

18:51.503 --> 18:52.752
<i>And in that moment,</i>

18:52.754 --> 18:55.055
<i>I knew my escape was doomed.</i>

18:55.057 --> 18:59.125
And pick me up lunch from
the Chinese place on the corner.

18:59.127 --> 19:00.477
The chicken one.

19:00.479 --> 19:02.345
Moo goo gai pan?

19:03.598 --> 19:06.433
Okay.

19:09.270 --> 19:11.404
Hi, stranger.
Mags.

19:11.406 --> 19:12.856
Mm.

19:15.694 --> 19:17.527
Mnh. Come on,
we're at school.

19:17.529 --> 19:18.745
Anybody could walk by.

19:18.747 --> 19:20.246
I know. That's what makes it
so sexy.

19:20.248 --> 19:21.481
Stop.

19:21.483 --> 19:23.450
I just wanna feel close to you.

19:23.452 --> 19:25.669
Well, you couldn't be any closer
than you are right now.

19:25.671 --> 19:27.587
You're kinda smothering me.

19:27.589 --> 19:28.755
I'm just trying
to get something started.

19:28.757 --> 19:30.874
It's not like <i>you</i> ever do.

19:30.876 --> 19:32.792
Kind of all alone in this.

19:32.794 --> 19:34.010
Well, maybe you shouldn't try so hard.

19:34.012 --> 19:36.012
It makes you seem desperate.

19:39.517 --> 19:42.602
<i>And while Walt and Maggie
were moving farther apart,</i>

19:42.604 --> 19:45.472
<i>I was getting closer to my dream.</i>

19:53.865 --> 19:55.949
♪ see them walking hand in hand

19:55.951 --> 20:00.787

20:11.166 --> 20:12.549
Darling, you've arrived!

20:12.551 --> 20:13.633
I'll say.

20:13.635 --> 20:15.552
- Oh!
- Today has been absolute chaos.

20:15.554 --> 20:17.387
Maybe these earrings.

20:17.389 --> 20:18.705
You say that like it's a good thing.

20:18.707 --> 20:21.341
Honey, I don't just thrive
in chaos. I love it.

20:21.343 --> 20:23.727
The moment where all is lost is
the moment I wanna live in,

20:23.729 --> 20:26.713
because <i>that</i> is where creativity lives.

20:26.715 --> 20:27.847
It inspires.

20:27.849 --> 20:28.982
<i>I wondered if that was true</i>

20:28.984 --> 20:30.600
<i>or just the lie we tell ourselves.</i>

20:30.602 --> 20:31.718
Perfect.

20:31.720 --> 20:35.054
Now give me that bag.
It deserves its moment.

20:35.056 --> 20:37.107
♪ Girls on film ♪ on film

20:41.747 --> 20:43.663

20:51.423 --> 20:52.905

20:52.907 --> 20:56.376

21:01.916 --> 21:04.217
Thank you.
This is a dream come true.

21:04.219 --> 21:05.552
And to think,
you almost missed all this

21:05.554 --> 21:08.121
because of some boring work thing.

21:08.123 --> 21:09.723
Oh, no. Work.

21:09.725 --> 21:12.442
I have to go.
I have to get back.

21:12.444 --> 21:14.394
Here, uh, take this zebra.

21:14.396 --> 21:17.430
Wait. You're such
a mystery, always dashing off.

21:17.432 --> 21:18.898
So exciting.

21:18.900 --> 21:20.784
How will I get your purse back?

21:20.786 --> 21:22.285
Uh, I'll call you.

21:22.287 --> 21:23.453
Okay.

21:23.455 --> 21:24.771
Bye. Mwah!

21:24.773 --> 21:26.406
Oh, Carrie, wait!

21:26.408 --> 21:28.441
<i>♪ Big hands, I know you're the one ♪</i>

21:28.443 --> 21:32.295
I want you to have this.
It's Dior. It's one-of-a-kind.

21:32.297 --> 21:33.463
I can't take that.

21:33.465 --> 21:36.049
Oh, of course you can.
You deserve it.

21:36.051 --> 21:37.667
You're one-of-a-kind.

21:37.669 --> 21:41.254
You don't believe it,
but one day you will.

21:41.256 --> 21:43.289
How will I ever believe that?

21:43.291 --> 21:44.591
You know the fairy tale Pinocchio?

21:44.593 --> 21:46.092
Yeah.
Well, that little puppet was

21:46.094 --> 21:49.312
a pretend boy who became real
because he believed it.

21:49.314 --> 21:51.731
Actually, Pinocchio
could only become real

21:51.733 --> 21:54.100
if he told the truth, and he couldn't.

21:54.102 --> 21:55.602
Okay, well...

21:55.604 --> 21:58.271
Then not that story.

21:58.273 --> 22:00.607
The point is, sometimes you have
to fake it to make it.

22:00.609 --> 22:04.477
After a while,
what's fake becomes truth.

22:05.446 --> 22:07.247

- Can explain? Maybe <i>I</i> should explain.

23:02.851 --> 23:04.767
I'm the person
who signs that little sheet

23:04.769 --> 23:06.969
that gets you credit
for this internship.

23:06.971 --> 23:09.389
- But...
- But you think you're young and cute,

23:09.391 --> 23:10.589

with Harlan silver,

23:12.927 --> 23:14.593
you're not accountable.

23:14.595 --> 23:17.196
No. I know I am.

23:17.198 --> 23:18.764
These are the binders
that are already done.

23:18.766 --> 23:20.016
Well, 50 of them.

23:20.018 --> 23:22.268
I still have the last ten to do
this afternoon.

23:22.270 --> 23:23.936
When the printer realized
their mistake,

23:23.938 --> 23:26.656
they offered to collate them
free of charge.

23:26.658 --> 23:29.025
Uh, and here's the Constantine case.

23:29.027 --> 23:30.126
Oh, cases.

23:30.128 --> 23:31.461
There were two different Constantines,

23:31.463 --> 23:33.296
so I brought them both just to be safe.

23:33.298 --> 23:35.581
<i>It was gonna take

23:35.583 --> 23:37.133

And, um...

23:38.937 --> 23:41.087
Here.
What is that?

23:41.089 --> 23:43.556
It's a scarf.

23:43.558 --> 23:45.975
I know you have
something special tonight,

23:45.977 --> 23:49.011
so I thought you might like this.

23:51.515 --> 23:53.399
I couldn't take that.

23:53.401 --> 23:55.634
I bought it for you.

24:00.491 --> 24:02.825
How much do I owe you?

24:02.827 --> 24:05.278
I got it in the bargain bin.

24:05.280 --> 24:08.498
You can buy me a bagel
or something one morning.

24:08.500 --> 24:12.318
Oh, and I, uh, left
your Chinese food on your desk.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.303
And I got you extra pancakes.

24:14.305 --> 24:16.539
Well, thank you.

24:16.541 --> 24:18.508
Now get back to work.

24:18.510 --> 24:19.992
Those binders aren't gonna
bind themselves.

24:19.994 --> 24:23.262
And if you screw up again
or disobey me,

24:23.264 --> 24:24.663
this internship's over.

24:28.719 --> 24:30.136
<i>The scarf was gone,</i>

24:30.138 --> 24:33.523
<i>but at least for now my life

24:33.525 --> 24:34.724
<i>I figured a little lie</i>

24:34.726 --> 24:38.161
<i>about a one-of-a-kind scarf
was worth it.</i>

24:40.899 --> 24:42.398
<i>Meanwhile, the mouse was wondering</i>

24:42.400 --> 24:44.700
<i>just what to tell me
about what she was seeing.</i>

24:44.702 --> 24:48.521
Oh! Mouse!
Mouse, come here.

24:50.324 --> 24:52.074
Hey.

24:52.076 --> 24:53.359
Hey.

24:53.361 --> 24:56.128
You look <i>so</i> cute today.
Doesn't she? So cute.

24:56.130 --> 24:57.696
Sure.

24:57.698 --> 24:59.365
Yeah.

24:59.367 --> 25:00.533
- Sure.
- Thanks.

25:00.535 --> 25:01.701
Well, I'm glad you showed up.

25:01.703 --> 25:04.170
I actually have to head off
to a massage, so...

25:04.172 --> 25:06.105
Sebastian here has just
been talking my ear off.

25:06.107 --> 25:08.341
That's me. The chatty type.

25:08.343 --> 25:10.059
You're so funny.

25:10.061 --> 25:12.812
Well, I will see you guys later.

25:12.814 --> 25:15.598
Don't miss me too much.

25:29.329 --> 25:31.497
It sucks you're not coming
to the video class tomorrow.

25:31.499 --> 25:34.917
It's gonna be so rad.
We're making a music video.

25:34.919 --> 25:38.504
I can't. I promised Carrie
I'd hang with her at the pool.

25:38.506 --> 25:39.755
I thought you hated her.

25:39.757 --> 25:43.709
She's not so bad.
I kinda feel sorry for her.

25:43.711 --> 25:46.128
It feels like she needs me,
so I don't wanna disappoint her.

25:46.130 --> 25:48.464
The only time my sister
even acknowledges me

25:48.466 --> 25:50.049
is when she knows
I took a message for her

25:50.051 --> 25:52.718
from one of her lame boyfriends.

25:52.720 --> 25:53.986
It's cool you and Carrie
like to hang out.

25:53.988 --> 25:56.188
Yeah. Whatever.
No big deal.

26:00.411 --> 26:03.095
This is from the photo shoot.
Larissa gave it to me.

26:03.097 --> 26:04.397
You might be the coolest person I know.

26:04.399 --> 26:07.934
Stop. As we both know,
I am a... Loser.

26:07.936 --> 26:09.535
Mnh-mnh. That's not what
Larissa thinks.

26:09.537 --> 26:11.487
It's weird. After Larissa
told me to fake it,

26:11.489 --> 26:12.922
I had to go back to my office

26:12.924 --> 26:15.124
and pretend I wasn't terrified
of bitchy Barbara.

26:15.126 --> 26:18.794
You know what? It worked.
It saved me from being fired.

26:18.796 --> 26:19.962
Hmm.

26:19.964 --> 26:23.082
Maybe it is that simple,
just believing it.

26:23.084 --> 26:24.584
Yeah.

26:24.586 --> 26:28.387
I should tell myself
I'm ready... with Maggie.

26:28.389 --> 26:29.755
Are you?

26:29.757 --> 26:32.725
I don't know what I'm waiting for.

26:32.727 --> 26:34.560
And it's important to her.

26:36.297 --> 26:38.598
I'm gonna surprise her
tomorrow after school.

26:38.600 --> 26:40.316
I guess.

26:40.318 --> 26:42.101
But, Walt...

26:43.270 --> 26:45.404
Mouse.
What are you doing here?

26:45.406 --> 26:47.406
I guess all your friends
really wanted to make sure

26:47.408 --> 26:48.858
you got your homework.

26:48.860 --> 26:51.277
Okay, you guys can only stay
here for a little while longer.

26:51.279 --> 26:53.746
All right? Carrie is
still grounded, after all.

26:53.748 --> 26:55.114
Leaving in five.

26:56.617 --> 26:59.085
I change my vote on Sebastian.

26:59.087 --> 27:00.486
What are you talking about?

27:00.488 --> 27:01.921
Go for it.

27:01.923 --> 27:04.624
You cannot let that two-faced,
big-lipped bitch get him.

27:04.626 --> 27:06.359
She's kind of an evil genius.

27:06.361 --> 27:09.261
I completely underestimated her.

27:09.263 --> 27:10.963
She called me cute

27:10.965 --> 27:13.115
and said that she was happy to see me

27:13.117 --> 27:14.717
in front of Sebastian.

27:14.719 --> 27:17.153
She actually seemed nice.

27:17.155 --> 27:18.554
Donna.

27:18.556 --> 27:19.805
Nice.

27:19.807 --> 27:21.774
Okay, that is terrifying.

27:21.776 --> 27:24.744
You better move, and fast.

27:32.119 --> 27:34.120
You wanna meet at the swim club today?

27:34.122 --> 27:36.288
I thought you were grounded?

27:36.290 --> 27:39.208
That's for me to worry about.
So do you wanna meet or not?

27:39.210 --> 27:41.160
Of course.
Meet there at 4:30?

27:41.162 --> 27:42.828
Make it 4:00 and I'm yours.

27:42.830 --> 27:44.163
I like the sound of that.

27:44.165 --> 27:46.640
Good. Don't be late.

27:58.192 --> 28:00.578
<i>Today was the day...</i>

28:02.297 --> 28:05.866
<i>I would</i> completely <i>disappoint Dorrit.</i>

28:05.868 --> 28:07.751
Dorrit.

28:07.753 --> 28:11.171
Why do you seem surprised to see me?

28:12.674 --> 28:13.807
So you're not mad?

28:13.809 --> 28:15.476
Of course not. I get it.

28:15.478 --> 28:17.978
Okay, so I'll see you
at home. You're okay walking?

28:17.980 --> 28:19.930
Sure. No problem.

28:19.932 --> 28:22.066
We can hang when I get back.

28:23.068 --> 28:25.319
<i>I told myself that Dorrit was fine.</i>

28:25.321 --> 28:27.104
<i>I wasn't sure if I believed it,</i>

28:27.106 --> 28:29.273
<i>but I didn't have time to dwell on it.</i>

28:29.275 --> 28:31.609
<i>And while I hurried to get ready...</i>

28:31.611 --> 28:33.377
<i>Walt waited...</i>

28:33.379 --> 28:35.462
<i>For Maggie.</i>

28:43.088 --> 28:47.458
<i>Unfortunately,
Maggie hadn't waited for Walt.</i>

28:47.460 --> 28:48.759
Oh, thank God it's you.

28:48.761 --> 28:50.427
Oh, I don't know who else it'd be.

28:50.429 --> 28:52.296
Well, see, my dad's
the chief of police,

28:52.298 --> 28:55.299
so he has this car with, like,
the lights and the siren thingy.

28:55.301 --> 28:56.934
You're such a smart-ass.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.135
Isn't that what you like about me?

28:58.137 --> 28:59.386
Come on. Get in.

28:59.388 --> 29:00.754
Thought you'd never ask.

29:03.943 --> 29:07.094
<i>While Maggie was all bravado,</i>

29:07.096 --> 29:09.930
<i>I tried to fake I wasn't nervous</i>

29:09.932 --> 29:12.483
<i>but was doing a lousy job.</i>

29:28.801 --> 29:29.833
I love how aggressive you are.

29:29.835 --> 29:31.251
I am not. Shut up.

29:31.253 --> 29:33.304
That time at your parents' barbecue...

29:33.306 --> 29:35.089
I never thought of you
as anything more than a kid.

29:35.091 --> 29:37.057
You showed me.

29:41.896 --> 29:43.514
Oh.

29:43.516 --> 29:44.765
Well, I hate to break up the party,

29:44.767 --> 29:46.984
but we should probably get going.

29:46.986 --> 29:49.770
Hey, can you, um...

29:49.772 --> 29:51.772
Can you just lie with me?

29:51.774 --> 29:53.473
It's getting kinda late.

29:53.475 --> 29:55.326
Just for a minute or two.

29:55.328 --> 29:57.528
You just can't get enough, can you?

30:02.817 --> 30:04.451
<i>It was getting harder and harder</i>

30:04.453 --> 30:08.455
<i>for Maggie to lie to herself
that this was real intimacy.</i>

30:12.844 --> 30:14.345
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey.

30:14.347 --> 30:17.297
You're home from the pool early.

30:17.299 --> 30:18.632
Everything okay?

30:24.889 --> 30:26.724
So you didn't think I'd be on time?

30:26.726 --> 30:30.027
I never said that. I was
just impressed that you are.

30:30.029 --> 30:32.312
I hate people who are late.

30:32.314 --> 30:34.615
My mom's always late.

30:34.617 --> 30:36.450
You'd think after 18 years
of being screamed at by my dad,

30:36.452 --> 30:38.452
she could have figured out
how to be on time.

30:38.454 --> 30:40.854
Yeah, but we ladies have
a lot more to do

30:40.856 --> 30:42.656
than you to get ready, you know?

30:42.658 --> 30:45.743
We've gotta pick an outfit
and do our makeup and hair.

30:45.745 --> 30:48.028
You don't need any of that.

30:48.030 --> 30:49.546
Don't lie.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.915
I'm not lying.

30:53.802 --> 30:57.337
I want you to kiss me.

30:57.339 --> 30:59.206
So kiss me.

31:07.315 --> 31:10.234
Carrie?

31:10.236 --> 31:13.161
<i>It looked like my lies
were catching up to me.</i>

31:20.947 --> 31:22.363
Let's go, Carrie.

31:23.398 --> 31:26.016
Mr. Bradshaw?

31:26.018 --> 31:28.536
I want to apologize.
For corrupting my daughter?

31:28.538 --> 31:30.705
I asked him there.
It was my idea.

31:30.707 --> 31:34.242
But I said yes.
I-I apologize, sir.

31:34.244 --> 31:37.161
I'm Sebastian,
Mr. Bradshaw.

31:43.535 --> 31:45.219
That's a nice handshake.

31:45.221 --> 31:46.804
Thank you, sir.

31:46.806 --> 31:49.807
My grandfather taught me
the handshake makes the man.

31:49.809 --> 31:52.894
Yeah, mine, too.

31:52.896 --> 31:54.879
What did you say your name was?

31:54.881 --> 31:56.848
Sebastian. Sebastian Kydd.

31:56.850 --> 31:58.649
Garret's son?

31:58.651 --> 31:59.901
You know my dad?

31:59.903 --> 32:01.385
I do. Yeah.

32:01.387 --> 32:04.572
Now if, uh, you'll excuse us,
Sebastian, we have to get going.

32:04.574 --> 32:05.857
So I can be punished

32:05.859 --> 32:07.391
for the rest of my life.

32:21.924 --> 32:23.090
Walt.

32:23.092 --> 32:25.343
What are you doing here?

32:25.345 --> 32:28.012
Waiting for you.

32:28.014 --> 32:30.131
For how long?

32:30.133 --> 32:31.415
The last four hours.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.601
You waited here all that time?

32:35.103 --> 32:37.104
I came here

32:37.106 --> 32:38.973
because I thought I was ready.

32:40.225 --> 32:42.143
That tonight was it.

32:43.695 --> 32:46.063
But...

32:46.065 --> 32:49.033
The longer I waited
and wondered where you were...

32:49.035 --> 32:51.235
I wasn't with anyone, I swear.

32:51.237 --> 32:53.588
It doesn't matter.

32:55.407 --> 32:56.490
That's weird, right?

32:56.492 --> 32:59.010
That I wouldn't care.

32:59.012 --> 33:02.046
I don't know. Maybe you're not
the jealous type.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.116
I wanted to believe
that I was in love with you

33:06.118 --> 33:07.702
in the way that it matters.

33:07.704 --> 33:10.621
But the longer I stood here,

33:10.623 --> 33:13.674
I realized I wasn't.

33:13.676 --> 33:15.726
What are you saying?

33:15.728 --> 33:18.479
I think we should break up.

33:18.481 --> 33:20.898
Um, d-did I do
something? Because I can change.

33:20.900 --> 33:23.568
We can make it work.
It's not you. You're perfect.

33:23.570 --> 33:24.986
Then why don't you love me?

33:24.988 --> 33:26.737
Mags, I do.

33:28.408 --> 33:30.391
Just...

33:30.393 --> 33:31.609
Not in that way.

33:33.997 --> 33:37.314
But I'll always be here for you.

33:37.316 --> 33:39.116
Always.

33:40.986 --> 33:42.870
I'm sorry.

33:47.492 --> 33:51.045
<i>And for the first time,
Walt wasn't lying.</i>

33:51.047 --> 33:55.383
<i>It was hard, but at least
it was the truth.</i>

34:03.942 --> 34:07.278
Morning, daddy.
I made you breakfast.

34:07.280 --> 34:10.447
Strawberry with frosting.
Your favorite.

34:10.449 --> 34:12.516
And your coffee.

34:12.518 --> 34:14.184
Yeah, buttering me up

34:14.186 --> 34:16.320
isn't gonna change
what happened last night.

34:16.322 --> 34:18.623
Will I be able to
leave the house before college?

34:18.625 --> 34:20.541
Your punishment is done today.

34:20.543 --> 34:23.793
I said two weeks,
and it's been two weeks.

34:23.795 --> 34:25.913
Is this a trick?

34:25.915 --> 34:28.866
I'm not gonna lie to you.

34:28.868 --> 34:32.003
I never would've expected
this kind of behavior from you.

34:32.005 --> 34:33.754
I'm sorry.

34:33.755 --> 34:35.473
Just...

34:35.475 --> 34:37.925
Please know you <i>can</i> trust me.

34:37.927 --> 34:40.261
Can I? You lied to me.

34:40.263 --> 34:43.097
And I shouldn't have.

34:43.099 --> 34:44.849
I know that.

34:44.851 --> 34:47.101
Does it help that I feel awful?

34:47.103 --> 34:48.552
If Dorrit hadn't told me,

34:48.554 --> 34:50.905
I never would've even known
that you disobeyed me.

34:50.907 --> 34:52.723
I can't be with you all the time,

34:52.725 --> 34:54.391
but I have to trust that you're
gonna make the right choices,

34:54.393 --> 34:55.693
even when I'm not there.

34:55.695 --> 34:57.828
I need you to...

34:57.830 --> 34:59.163
Prove to me

34:59.165 --> 35:00.581
that you're the daughter
that I think you are.

35:00.583 --> 35:03.951
I will. I promise.

35:03.953 --> 35:07.237
Good. Because if you don't,
there will be consequences.

35:07.239 --> 35:08.422
I know.

35:08.424 --> 35:09.974
Like no more internship.

35:09.976 --> 35:12.426
Okay. I got it.

35:12.428 --> 35:14.762
No more screwups.

35:14.764 --> 35:16.931
Good.

35:19.084 --> 35:22.269
So... you're okay
if I go out tonight?

35:22.271 --> 35:25.940
Yeah, but not with that Sebastian.

35:25.942 --> 35:28.693
What?

35:28.695 --> 35:30.427
Wait, are you telling me I can't date?

35:30.429 --> 35:32.430
Because we're gonna have
a serious problem.

35:32.432 --> 35:34.648
No, I'm telling you that
you can't date <i>him.</i>

35:34.650 --> 35:37.952
I... know a little bit
about him and his family,

35:37.954 --> 35:40.821
and, uh, I'm telling you to stay away.

35:40.823 --> 35:42.373
Why?

35:42.375 --> 35:44.274
Because I said so.

35:44.276 --> 35:46.844
You expect me not to see
the cutest guy at school,

35:46.846 --> 35:48.746
and your reason is "because I said so"?

35:48.748 --> 35:51.115
Yeah.

35:54.503 --> 35:59.390
<i>Pinocchio was a puppet
that wanted to be a real boy.</i>

35:59.392 --> 36:01.258
<i>All he had to do was be truthful,</i>

36:01.260 --> 36:03.477
<i>and his wish would come true.</i>

36:03.479 --> 36:06.130
<i>And even then,
he couldn't help but lie.</i>

36:07.649 --> 36:10.134
<i>Doing the right thing is hard.</i>

36:10.136 --> 36:13.687
<i>Maybe because lying is often
easier than the truth.</i>

36:13.689 --> 36:18.142
<i>And sometimes it actually
gets you what you want.</i>

36:18.144 --> 36:20.494
<i>But at some point,
like Pinocchio's nose,</i>

36:20.496 --> 36:22.163
<i>the lies just keep growing</i>

36:22.165 --> 36:26.000
<i>until it's hard to tell
what's real and what's not.</i>

36:27.786 --> 36:30.671
<i>And we can either live
in that world of make-believe</i>

36:30.673 --> 36:31.789
<i>or face the truth</i>

36:31.791 --> 36:35.009
<i>and everything that comes with it.</i>

36:41.884 --> 36:44.552
Hey.

36:44.554 --> 36:45.803
I know you're mad.

36:45.805 --> 36:48.839
I'm not mad.

36:48.841 --> 36:50.191
Not at you.

36:50.193 --> 36:53.727
At myself...
For blowing you off.

36:53.729 --> 36:55.546
That wasn't cool.

36:55.548 --> 36:57.064
No, it wasn't.

36:57.066 --> 36:58.199
I'm sorry.

36:58.201 --> 36:59.984
I was hoping to make it up to you.

36:59.986 --> 37:01.869
You wanna hang out?
We can make a night of it?

37:01.871 --> 37:04.221
I think, uh, mouse is coming over.

37:04.223 --> 37:06.440
Maybe watch "The Wall" or something?

37:06.442 --> 37:07.741
Are we gonna be stoned?

37:07.743 --> 37:09.693
No.

37:09.695 --> 37:11.862
Then I don't get it.
What's the point?

37:13.632 --> 37:15.349
I bought a bootlegged copy
of "Purple Rain."

37:15.351 --> 37:16.667
How'd you get that?

37:16.669 --> 37:18.836
I think it's better if you don't know.

37:18.838 --> 37:20.387
Huh.

37:20.389 --> 37:21.739
You're something, Dorrit.

37:21.741 --> 37:24.341
I know.

37:25.678 --> 37:28.262
That's probably mouse now.

37:35.604 --> 37:36.904
Hey.

37:36.906 --> 37:40.024
Hey.

37:40.026 --> 37:42.359
So that was weird yesterday.

37:42.361 --> 37:45.896
Yeah. My dad's
really overprotective.

37:45.898 --> 37:47.832
You grounded for life?

37:47.834 --> 37:49.733
Uh, surprisingly, no.

37:49.735 --> 37:52.736
So you can hang out tonight?
We can go to the concert.

37:52.738 --> 37:54.588
Actually, I can't.

37:54.590 --> 37:56.624
- Oh.
- It's not that I don't want to.

37:56.626 --> 37:58.042
I do. A lot.

37:58.044 --> 38:01.345
Uh... it's just, things have
been tense in my house.

38:01.347 --> 38:04.348
Yeah, it's fine, Bradshaw.

38:04.350 --> 38:07.101
You can't be that mad at me
since you called me "Bradshaw."

38:07.103 --> 38:08.969
Does it bother you?

38:08.971 --> 38:11.171
No. I like it.

38:11.173 --> 38:13.474
Okay then, Bradshaw.

38:13.476 --> 38:15.693
I'll see you on monday.

38:15.695 --> 38:17.695
Okay, Kydd.

38:17.697 --> 38:18.779
I'll see you then.

38:18.781 --> 38:20.197
<i>All along,</i>

38:20.199 --> 38:23.083
<i>I thought I was juggling
my new guy and my new city.</i>

38:23.085 --> 38:26.153
<i>In reality,
it was a lot more complicated.</i>

38:26.155 --> 38:30.824
<i>I would need to choose between
Sebastian and my dad.</i>

38:30.826 --> 38:32.877
Who was that?

38:32.879 --> 38:35.412
Um, door-to-door salesman.

38:35.414 --> 38:38.515
Apparently, he thinks we need
more encyclopedias.

38:38.517 --> 38:39.616
I told him we didn't.

38:39.618 --> 38:42.586
So what are you gonna do tonight?

38:42.588 --> 38:43.954
Uh, mouse is on her way over.

38:43.956 --> 38:46.140
We're gonna watch "Purple Rain"
with Dorrit.

38:47.309 --> 38:48.625
<i>It turns out.</i>

38:48.627 --> 38:51.295
<i>I was a lot more like Pinocchio
than I thought.</i>

38:51.297 --> 38:53.764
I don't understand why
the movie looked like that.

38:53.766 --> 38:55.983
Did someone videotape it in a theater?

38:55.985 --> 38:57.067
Yes.

38:57.069 --> 38:59.403
It looked like crap.
Who would bother?

38:59.405 --> 39:00.571
Me.

39:02.275 --> 39:05.776
Hey. Um, I hope it's okay
I just let myself in.

39:05.778 --> 39:07.745
Mags, I thought you were
hanging out with Walt tonight?

39:07.747 --> 39:11.065
He... he broke up with me.

39:11.067 --> 39:13.167
Oh.

39:16.154 --> 39:17.755
I'm sorry.

39:19.542 --> 39:21.491
It's okay.

39:23.261 --> 39:25.846
Dorrit, get in here.
Come on.

39:27.049 --> 39:29.216
Mmm.

39:36.274 --> 39:37.942
Men are so damn complicated.

39:37.944 --> 39:39.509
Especially the dad-kind.

39:39.511 --> 39:41.178
I can second that.

39:41.180 --> 39:42.730
Or the ex-boyfriend-kind

39:42.732 --> 39:45.866
who calls you up after two weeks
and tells you they miss you.

39:45.868 --> 39:48.452
What? Seth called?

39:48.454 --> 39:49.570
What did you say?

39:49.572 --> 39:51.188
I said hi.

39:51.190 --> 39:53.273
So are you gonna take him back?

39:53.275 --> 39:55.876
I don't know.

39:57.162 --> 39:59.463
I just know I miss him.

39:59.465 --> 40:01.098
I miss Walt.

40:01.100 --> 40:03.050
I miss Sebastian.

40:03.052 --> 40:05.669
You guys are so lame.

40:08.089 --> 40:10.040
Totally!

40:10.042 --> 40:11.925
Now give me one of those sandwiches.
