Is there a procedure
for waking him up?

00:39.154 --> 00:42.255
- What are the risks?
- Massive seizure, cerebral hemorrhage,

death.

Tell me what the target is.
Tell me where the attack

They do. And you will see to it
that it does.

01:03.777 --> 01:05.312

Hauptbahnhof Station,

CARRIE: <i>- Bibi Hamed</i>

It's the perfect time
to hit the subway.

it's the airport, Saul?

to do it then.

he's my cousin.

04:26.577 --> 04:27.843

the gas everywhere.

15:28.322 --> 15:31.291
Nothing, nothing.

15:31.359 --> 15:34.628
It's a good pitch you're making.

15:34.695 --> 15:36.963
I'm... I'm admiring it.

15:43.904 --> 15:46.038
I was gonna tell you
it's not for nothing.

15:46.106 --> 15:47.673
- No?
- No.

15:47.741 --> 15:48.875
Hmm.

15:48.942 --> 15:50.977
You came this close

15:51.044 --> 15:53.980
to painting a masterpiece.

15:54.047 --> 15:55.648
This close.

15:57.384 --> 15:59.385
And not many people
can say that.

16:04.258 --> 16:07.193
But I won't
be making you another offer

16:07.261 --> 16:09.361
like this anytime soon.

16:09.429 --> 16:11.363
I'm being generous,

16:11.431 --> 16:15.134
because you have
something I want very much.

16:15.202 --> 16:18.470
Take it or leave it.

16:31.217 --> 16:33.352
Very well.

16:36.389 --> 16:38.357
It's a shame, though.

16:38.425 --> 16:40.526
I would've enjoyed
talking to you again.

16:42.161 --> 16:44.029
It was my idea.

16:52.438 --> 16:54.439
You were an easy target, Saul.

I knew if you were
sleeping with her,

you wouldn't see
other things so clearly.

- Of course.

30:51.453 --> 30:53.354

30:53.421 --> 30:55.422
But the hematoma
was very large.

30:55.490 --> 30:57.892

will be significant.

interviewed a lot more.

48:27.048 --> 48:28.649
Well, you're picky.

48:28.716 --> 48:30.384
(chuckling):
You're famous for it.

48:30.451 --> 48:33.153
Never anybody like you, though.

48:33.221 --> 48:36.022
That's nice of you to say.

48:36.090 --> 48:38.892
It's not nice.

48:38.959 --> 48:40.561
I read your application,

48:40.628 --> 48:42.162
saw right away
how brilliant you are,

48:42.230 --> 48:45.399
what a freethinker,

48:45.466 --> 48:47.167
and insisted on meeting you.

48:47.235 --> 48:48.835
I remember.

48:48.903 --> 48:53.706
We sat down at 10:15
on a Wednesday morning.

48:53.773 --> 48:56.909
I offered you the
position at 10:30.

48:56.976 --> 48:59.679
I remember.

49:01.648 --> 49:04.617
I was waiting for you, Carrie.

49:04.685 --> 49:07.753
I was waiting for you
to walk through the door.

49:10.224 --> 49:13.157
Okay, now I'm a little lost.

49:13.226 --> 49:15.993
I want a partner,

49:16.061 --> 49:18.830
someone who knows the world
for what it is

49:18.897 --> 49:20.699
but also knows
it must be made better.

49:20.766 --> 49:23.368
Someone to share
my life with.

49:26.071 --> 49:27.872
Otto...

49:36.282 --> 49:38.250
You don't have
to answer now.

49:38.317 --> 49:40.252
Go back to America.

49:40.319 --> 49:42.787
Spend time with your daughter.

49:42.855 --> 49:44.456
Think about it.

49:47.793 --> 49:49.727
I-I don't know what to say.

49:49.795 --> 49:51.229
Say nothing.

49:51.296 --> 49:55.399
Just think about the scope
and scale of what I'm proposing.

49:55.467 --> 49:57.468
The possibilities.

49:59.838 --> 50:02.439
I'll be in Washington
next month for meetings.

50:09.381 --> 50:11.448
We can talk then.

50:30.034 --> 50:31.968
(phone line ringing)

50:32.036 --> 50:33.304
LAURA:
Hello.

50:33.371 --> 50:34.971
Laura, what's going on?

50:35.039 --> 50:36.473
They just let me go.

50:38.610 --> 50:40.543
Numan, I can't talk to you.

50:40.611 --> 50:42.378
What do you mean, you can't
talk to me? Why not?

50:42.446 --> 50:45.348
It's a condition
of the deal I made.

50:45.416 --> 50:47.017
I can't talk to you ever again.

50:47.084 --> 50:49.019
What deal?

50:50.487 --> 50:52.555
Good-bye.
