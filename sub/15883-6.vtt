01:00.668 --> 01:02.373
Good evening, everybody,
I'm Keegan-Michael Key.

Happy Halloween, everybody.

01:08.951 --> 01:09.916
- Welcome.
- Happy Halloween.

01:09.954 --> 01:11.520
- This is our...
- All Hallow's Eve, yes.

01:11.536 --> 01:13.704
- Our Halloween celebration.
- Mm-hmm, yes.

01:13.723 --> 01:15.924
Um, we are...
we're fans of horror movies.

01:16.063 --> 01:17.363
And there's
several different kinds.

01:17.372 --> 01:18.739
- There's several different kinds.
- There's... right.

01:18.777 --> 01:22.033
There's the kind where
there's little Asian children

01:22.123 --> 01:23.469
that sound like Penelope Cruz.

01:23.512 --> 01:25.912
Yup, yeah.
(laughs)

01:26.711 --> 01:28.345
Well, you know what?
My favorite...

01:28.363 --> 01:31.053
My favorite horror movies
are the possession ones.

01:31.074 --> 01:34.089
- Oh, yes, yes.
- And since I've been in California,

01:34.367 --> 01:37.079
I will go see a horror movie
at 12:00 at night.

01:37.123 --> 01:38.768
I went and saw
<i>Paranormal Activity</i>,

01:38.807 --> 01:42.036
There was a family of
75 Mexican people in front of me.

01:44.105 --> 01:46.732
And 90% of them were
under the age of four.

01:47.663 --> 01:50.231
And... and you know what the most
messed up thing about it is,

01:50.438 --> 01:53.207
like clockwork,
about halfway through the movie,

01:53.207 --> 01:54.293
- at some point...
- Yeah, yeah.

01:54.389 --> 01:57.820
Somebody goes, "Oh, no,
it's not a ghost, it's a demon."

01:57.866 --> 01:59.015
The entire mexican family,

01:59.036 --> 02:00.961
"Oh, no, [bleep] this.
We don't [bleep] with that."

02:01.020 --> 02:02.285
(mumbling)

02:03.060 --> 02:04.827
- Right in front of my action.
- Everybody, there's the kid...

02:04.843 --> 02:07.011
Oh, come on, this is...

02:07.011 --> 02:08.402
This is ridiculous.

02:08.433 --> 02:10.651
They're all leaving,
the whole family.

02:10.652 --> 02:12.714
- This is a... you know...
- <i>En masse</i>, out the door.

02:12.736 --> 02:15.336
It's a horror movie,
it's always <i>Diablo!</i>

02:15.358 --> 02:17.054
Yeah, what did you think
was gonna happen?

02:17.069 --> 02:18.035

02:20.023 --> 02:21.722
Oh, here we go, we got more.

08:32.236 --> 08:35.121

08:35.192 --> 08:37.357

09:22.086 --> 09:24.388
Clortho's and Hogwarts,
they go hand-in-hand,

09:24.455 --> 09:27.092
The best top two
wizarding schools there are.

09:27.694 --> 09:29.699
<i>But you know,
out of these two schools,</i>

09:29.765 --> 09:30.939
<i>we each have a strike.</i>

09:30.985 --> 09:34.406
We do score a little bit lower
on standardized tests

09:34.475 --> 09:38.311
than hogwarts,
but there <i>is</i> a cultural bias.

09:38.357 --> 09:41.492
We may not have
a huge endowment

09:41.518 --> 09:43.586
like they get
over at Hogwarts,

09:43.632 --> 09:45.933
and yes, some of the teachers
have to buy

09:45.969 --> 09:48.035
their own newt's eyes
or bat wings or...

09:48.083 --> 09:49.652
One kid got transformed
into a cat.

09:49.657 --> 09:51.239
They can't even afford
to change him back.

09:51.245 --> 09:52.912
This young man's name
is Jamar.

09:53.215 --> 09:55.616
Normally, you're not allowed
to touch the students like this

09:55.620 --> 09:57.287
when they're in human form,

09:57.441 --> 10:01.077
But when they're a cat,
we just have at it.

10:02.049 --> 10:03.446
<i>Sports.</i>

10:03.492 --> 10:05.145
<i>Everybody loves sports.</i>

10:05.169 --> 10:06.167
- It's true.
- Not everybody.

10:06.218 --> 10:07.718
The hallways are a-bluster

10:07.758 --> 10:09.726
with the conversation
of our Quidditch team.

10:09.751 --> 10:11.667
Half the team
is back here riding mops.

10:11.693 --> 10:13.276
We got two little [bleep]
on Swiffers.

10:13.287 --> 10:14.251
Lester!

10:15.103 --> 10:18.824
When all is said and done,
the average Clortho student...

10:18.863 --> 10:20.565
(squeaking)
uh, say... This mother...

10:21.263 --> 10:22.413
(laughs)

10:22.802 --> 10:24.542
Sometimes the kids
think it's cute

10:24.590 --> 10:26.257
To turn themselves
into a rat,

10:26.411 --> 10:28.416
(laughs)
sneak into my office,

10:28.419 --> 10:29.555
Play a little joke on me.

10:29.581 --> 10:31.423
Who is that?
Tyrone, is that... is that...?

10:31.444 --> 10:32.945
No,
that's an actual rat.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.392
So I'm doing this, like,
airline food diet.

10:36.414 --> 10:37.381
- Yeah.
- It's, like, all I eat,

10:37.406 --> 10:38.306
and I've lost,
like, 16 pounds.

10:38.308 --> 10:39.256
- Oh, my God, Amy.
- Yeah.

10:39.279 --> 10:40.654
- I almost forgot to tell you.
- What?

10:40.654 --> 10:41.826
We got a new receptionist
at work.

10:41.828 --> 10:43.262
- Ew! No way.
- Yeah. So...

10:43.266 --> 10:45.416
I'm in the common area alone,
minding my own business...

10:45.442 --> 10:46.751
- Yeah...oh,
she said something to you?

10:46.754 --> 10:48.489
She came up to me,
and no joke, she's like,

10:48.684 --> 10:50.919
"Hi, I'm Sandy.
I don't believe we've met yet."

10:50.967 --> 10:52.788
(gasps)
She said that to you?

10:52.831 --> 10:55.299
Like, no, Amy,
I'm not even kidding you.

10:55.302 --> 10:57.102
She's crazy.
- Um, yeah!

10:57.149 --> 11:01.102
No, like, I'm scared, like, crazy,
like, get this bitch away from me,

11:01.172 --> 11:03.130
She's sociopathically
batshit crazy.

11:03.155 --> 11:04.255
Oh, my God,
that totally reminds me,

11:04.280 --> 11:06.114
- I have a new neighbor.
- Ew, yeah?

11:06.117 --> 11:07.871
She comes over to my house,
she knocks on the door

11:07.897 --> 11:09.962
with, like, a <i>package</i> under her arm.

11:09.962 --> 11:11.996
- Um, stalker much?
- Um, yeah.

11:11.999 --> 11:13.900
And she looks me in the eye,
and she says to me,

11:13.925 --> 11:16.560
"Um, excuse me,
I think the postman

11:16.563 --> 11:19.492
dropped this package off
at my house by accident."

11:19.527 --> 11:21.039
- (gasps) She said that to you?
- (gasps) Yeah.

11:21.073 --> 11:22.422
- Crazy bitch!
- I mean, like,

11:22.469 --> 11:24.236
I'm gonna have to move
because this bitch is

11:24.283 --> 11:25.617
nutburgers-McLooneytunes,

11:25.663 --> 11:27.798
stand-at-the-foot-of-my-bed-
with-a-knife crazy.

11:27.823 --> 11:29.423
Oh, my God,
that totally reminds me!

11:29.448 --> 11:31.123
- Oh, yeah.
- You remember that girl at Starbuck's?

11:31.156 --> 11:33.068
- The crazy one?
- No, a different one. She's new.

11:33.109 --> 11:35.110
- I haven't met her yet.
- Well, she's crazy.

11:35.155 --> 11:36.723
- Uh-huh.
- She gives me my change,

11:36.769 --> 11:39.123
and then she's like,
"Thanks, bye."

11:39.619 --> 11:42.254
(gasps)
She smiled at you like that?

11:42.258 --> 11:44.359
- How crazy is that?
- That's, like...

11:44.384 --> 11:46.482
That's, like,
insane-in-the-membrane crazy.

11:46.490 --> 11:49.173
Like, this is the membrane, she's
inside of it, 'cause that's insane.

11:49.173 --> 11:50.823
No, I'm not even
kidding you, Amy,

11:50.830 --> 11:53.314
that's crazy like, it-puts-
the-lotion-in-the-basket,

11:53.338 --> 11:56.606
or-else-it-gets-the-hose-again,
Cray-to-the-mother[bleep] Cray!

11:56.675 --> 11:59.834
Yeah, like, if Jay-Z had a sister,
her name would be "Cray."

11:59.885 --> 12:00.517
Hey!

12:01.477 --> 12:03.378
You ladies
want to meet Channing Tatum?

12:03.446 --> 12:04.746
(gasps)

12:04.771 --> 12:06.705
- Is he really in there?
- Are you serious?

12:06.902 --> 12:09.303
- Oh, Channing!
- (gasps) Oh, my God, Channing!

12:09.328 --> 12:10.662
Channing,
what are you doing in a van?

12:10.686 --> 12:12.721
This is effing crazy.
I don't see you, Channing.

12:12.746 --> 12:14.279
- Why are you hiding?
- Why are you in here?

12:14.283 --> 12:16.481
Channing, are you, like,
in a little ball in the front seat?

12:16.515 --> 12:18.089
Hello?
It smells like mildew in here.

12:18.108 --> 12:20.322
- I bet...
- ow! Sharp, jagged, rusty edge.

12:20.346 --> 12:21.429
Is that a meat hook?

12:27.703 --> 12:30.848
You guys, uh, you guys know
what a human centipede is?

12:30.960 --> 12:32.027
(mixed reaction)
Human centipede?

12:32.073 --> 12:33.002
Yeah.
You guys?

12:33.028 --> 12:34.262
Some of you don't?
Some people don't.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.047
There's this movie
called <i>Human Centipede.</i>

12:36.061 --> 12:38.326
It's the most [bleep] up
horror movie ever.

12:38.371 --> 12:39.916
Ever made.
Ever made, ever.

12:39.944 --> 12:42.260
And what happens, basically,
three people

12:42.292 --> 12:45.000
and the first person's ass is sewn
to the next person's mouth.

12:45.068 --> 12:46.796
- Mouth.
- Whose ass is sewn...

12:46.803 --> 12:49.037
To the next person's mouth.

12:49.364 --> 12:52.890
And hence,
a multi-legged organism, uh...

12:53.154 --> 12:55.053
And then...
Look at this woman's mouth,

12:55.091 --> 12:56.652
It's just open... Don't open
your mouth right now, ma'am.

12:56.679 --> 12:57.646
She's just, like... don't op...
yes, please, don't...

12:57.691 --> 12:58.649
You don't want
to open your...

12:58.677 --> 12:59.810
No one's gonna
do it to you, ma'am.

12:59.856 --> 13:01.423
(audience ohs)

13:02.161 --> 13:04.682
So here's what happened
in real life on planet Earth.

13:04.729 --> 13:06.671
[laughs]
- On planet earth, in real life,

13:06.724 --> 13:08.821
Somebody said, "Let's take
a look at this script here.

13:08.862 --> 13:10.088
- Yeah.
- "Let me see.

13:10.113 --> 13:12.129
"I think you'll like
everything I've done there.

13:12.199 --> 13:14.167
- "Uh-huh, okay.
- "Let me know how you think.

13:14.256 --> 13:16.451
"Uh-huh.
Yeah, uh-huh, oh, yeah,

13:16.762 --> 13:18.566
"this should make
millions of dollars."

13:21.649 --> 13:23.514
- I am gonna go wash my hands.
- Okay, sweetie.

13:23.525 --> 13:25.359
- Okay.
- See you in a second.

13:29.252 --> 13:30.416
(laughing)

13:31.107 --> 13:32.344
Buddy!

13:32.607 --> 13:35.709
Um, I'm sorry, uh,
that seat is actually taken.

13:35.992 --> 13:38.255
My girlfriend
is in the bathroom,

13:38.258 --> 13:40.580
and she should be back any second,
so you cannot sit there.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.912
You don't even recognize me,
do you?

13:42.937 --> 13:44.838
No. No, I d...I don't...
I don't know you.

13:44.905 --> 13:47.040
We were in
that human centipede together!

13:47.042 --> 13:49.244
I said,
I do not know you.

13:49.268 --> 13:52.296
Three years ago, we were kidnapped
by the crazy German scientist

13:52.356 --> 13:55.000
who surgically connected us
into a single human digestive chain.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.402
There were three of us,
I was in the middle,

13:56.469 --> 13:58.273
you were at the end,
the other guy was up front.

13:58.316 --> 14:00.229
Your mouth
was sewn to my butthole!

14:00.254 --> 14:01.491
Okay, yes, I remember!

14:01.541 --> 14:04.510
And after years of therapy,
I finally put that behind me.

14:04.667 --> 14:06.210
Probably should've said
you put it behind <i>me,</i>

14:06.236 --> 14:08.035
If you catch my drift.
(laughing) I'm sorry.

14:08.036 --> 14:09.805
Sorry!
You already caught my drift.

14:09.811 --> 14:11.264
I'm sorry! (laughs)
That's it.

14:11.310 --> 14:12.477
It was right there
in front of me.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.114
- Really? Really?
- (laughing) I'm sorry.

14:14.249 --> 14:15.730
I guess it was right there
in front of <i>you</i>.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.811
That's it.
(laughing) I'm sorry.

14:17.816 --> 14:20.547
How are you doing?
(laughing) How are you?

14:20.567 --> 14:22.168
Is there something else
I can help you with?

14:22.214 --> 14:23.914
- Um...oh!
- Hey, [bleep] eater.

14:23.939 --> 14:26.140
- No [bleep] way!
- Hey! (laughs)

14:26.164 --> 14:28.732
- Front man! (laughs)
- this is a [bleep] nightmare.

14:28.736 --> 14:29.936
Hey, Back man.
Back man!

14:29.939 --> 14:31.573
No, don't call me that.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.745
- Ah!
- Hey, cop a squat.

14:32.745 --> 14:33.912
No!

14:33.915 --> 14:35.831
Ooh, chili.
Old habits die hard?

14:35.877 --> 14:37.645
(laughs)
Nice one! (laughs)

14:37.648 --> 14:39.411
- Now I can't eat it.
- Oh, word?

14:39.742 --> 14:42.825
- Why are you happy to see him?
- Come on, man!

14:42.885 --> 14:45.363
You know, we all shared
the same experience.

14:45.388 --> 14:48.025
No, we didn't. He was in the front.
Nobody [bleep] in his mouth!

14:48.082 --> 14:48.979
That is true.

14:49.055 --> 14:52.242
- Do you ever stop eating? Ever?
- Only when I'm [bleep]. (laughs)

14:52.245 --> 14:53.014
Okay.

14:53.067 --> 14:56.173
- But me and you, right?
- Me and you what?

14:56.243 --> 14:58.454
I mean.
We were in the same boat.

14:58.517 --> 15:00.384
Nope, you two
were in the same boat.

15:00.430 --> 15:02.164
You both [bleep]
in someone's mouth.

15:02.232 --> 15:03.932
I didn't get to [bleep]
in anyone's mouth!

15:03.978 --> 15:04.545
"Get to"?

15:04.614 --> 15:06.370
When do I get to [bleep]
in anybody's mouth, huh?

15:06.373 --> 15:09.032
When do I get to [bleep]
in somebody's mouth?

15:09.072 --> 15:11.974
- Steven!
- Hon... I... No.

15:12.672 --> 15:15.545
These guys... I can explain this.
I can explain this.

15:16.215 --> 15:17.014
You...

15:17.126 --> 15:18.760
Oh, <i>you're</i> disgusted?

15:18.935 --> 15:20.513
You... oh, now,
you're gonna leave?

15:20.587 --> 15:22.921
(scoffs) oh, yeah.
That's great. Oh, yeah.

15:23.313 --> 15:25.815
Once again,
I'm the asshole.

15:26.726 --> 15:30.796
(<i>Hail to the Chief</i> playing)

15:31.459 --> 15:33.032
Good evening,
my fellow Americans.

15:33.553 --> 15:36.666
Now, as you know, sometimes
during the chaos

15:36.690 --> 15:38.172
of a presidential campaign,

15:38.266 --> 15:40.996
It's easy to forget the beauty
of the democratic process...

15:41.041 --> 15:41.940
This is it!
(alarm blaring)

15:42.461 --> 15:43.776
Armageddon!

15:43.843 --> 15:46.519
I mean, y'all got to
vote for me, y'all, you have to!

15:46.576 --> 15:50.082
Or we gonna get banked over
by a bunch of bitch-ass billionaires!

15:50.150 --> 15:52.217
(alarm continues whooping)

15:52.609 --> 15:54.343
This is
my anger translator, Luther,

15:54.455 --> 15:56.724
Who... I thought
had the day off.

15:57.336 --> 15:59.159
What the [bleep] are you
doing here, Luther?

15:59.208 --> 16:01.562
(alarm continues)
(crash, alarm stops)

16:01.766 --> 16:04.267
Anyway,
I think that everybody

16:04.681 --> 16:06.849
needs to take a moment
to appreciate

16:07.090 --> 16:09.558
that our political system
truly works.

16:09.646 --> 16:13.109
Unless Romney wins,
and then the [bleep] is broke!

16:14.017 --> 16:16.804
And despite the heated
rhetoric of a campaign, there's

16:16.976 --> 16:19.447
always a place
for civil discourse.

16:19.470 --> 16:21.641
As long as you got a few
million dollars lying around

16:21.695 --> 16:23.729
so you can counteract
all the negative ads.

16:23.905 --> 16:25.494
Hey, Romney and Karl Rove

16:25.515 --> 16:28.699
and all you evil mother[bleep]
with your slimy-ass super PACs,

16:28.723 --> 16:31.459
Y'all done poked a hornet's nest
with a sugar stick.

16:31.497 --> 16:34.527
Y'all slapped Frankenstein
right in the bolts, man.

16:34.565 --> 16:36.099
(grunting)

16:36.840 --> 16:37.841
Uhh!

16:38.531 --> 16:40.183
And you know what,
after I win this?

16:40.525 --> 16:42.267
I'm taking all y'all down.

16:43.053 --> 16:43.905
- Thank you,

16:44.212 --> 16:46.351
And I'll see you all
on the campaign trail.

16:46.543 --> 16:48.409
And when you give me
your babies to kiss,

16:48.517 --> 16:50.718
please clean they diapers,
all right?

16:50.807 --> 16:52.707
'cause I ain't trying
to kiss no poop!

16:52.862 --> 16:54.669
Just wash they ass.

16:55.055 --> 16:57.125
You know,
just wash their ass.

16:57.876 --> 17:00.603
It's true.
You should wash their ass.

17:02.446 --> 17:05.382
(<i>Hail to the chief</i> playing)

17:09.090 --> 17:10.959
(soul music)

17:12.405 --> 17:15.817
How come in every
Stephen King book or movie...

17:15.862 --> 17:16.560
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

17:16.595 --> 17:19.026
a black person
has got to have special powers?

17:19.179 --> 17:20.954
Yeah,
<i>Green Mile.</i>

17:20.998 --> 17:22.665
(magical humming)
And the mouse is alive.

17:22.667 --> 17:23.969
- Right.
- I mean, you know what I mean?

17:23.992 --> 17:25.894
Okay. (magical humming)
tom hanks' (bleep) works.

17:25.919 --> 17:27.156
- That's right.
- You know what I mean?

17:27.282 --> 17:28.077
It's just, like...

17:28.156 --> 17:29.732
Bees coming out
of this mother-[bleep] mouth.

17:29.761 --> 17:31.495
- Aah.
- I mean, you know what I mean?

17:31.529 --> 17:33.196
And in <i>The Stand,</i> the woman...
you know, she had...

17:33.250 --> 17:34.897
She was clairvoyant? Oh, yeah.

17:34.897 --> 17:36.772
Oh, Mama Abagail
gonna show you the way.

17:36.786 --> 17:38.961
- That's...oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

17:39.772 --> 17:41.341
- I want to go to Maine...
- Yes.

17:41.378 --> 17:43.041
So I can meet
all these magical black people.

17:43.046 --> 17:45.243
That is where magical
black people go to retire.

17:45.345 --> 17:46.712
I-I...yeah, right...
oh, okay.

17:48.920 --> 17:51.530
So your office is
all the way down at the end.

17:51.801 --> 17:54.147
You have your own attached
bathroom, by the way.

17:54.726 --> 17:57.400
Oh, um, here's one
of our best researchers. Dick?

17:57.401 --> 18:00.053
- Hey.
- Ah, hello there.

18:00.121 --> 18:02.756
(dramatic music)
<i>What's up, dude?</i>

18:03.267 --> 18:06.773
<i>Glad to see there's another brother
in this stuffy place.</i>

18:06.794 --> 18:10.864
- So, uh, this is gonna be
your assistant, Genevieve.

18:10.932 --> 18:12.733
- Genevieve, I'm...
- (dramatic music) <i>What is this?</i>

18:12.800 --> 18:14.773
<i>It's the Shining, man.</i>

18:15.045 --> 18:16.979
<i>All black people
have the Shining.</i>

18:17.114 --> 18:19.386
<i>You never shined with
another black person before?</i>

18:19.489 --> 18:22.548
<i>No, I grew up in a white neighborhood
and then went to Dartmouth.</i>

18:22.556 --> 18:25.382
<i>I've met other black people before,
but not like this.</i>

18:25.493 --> 18:28.729
<i>You gotta get shined at
by another black person first,</i>

18:28.797 --> 18:31.498
and then you get it.
It's kinda like Facebook.

18:33.257 --> 18:36.426
(dramatic music)
<i>What up, dudes?</i>

18:36.460 --> 18:39.445
<i>So every black person has this?
Is Kobe listening?</i>

18:39.462 --> 18:40.543
(voice of Kobe Bryant)
Yo, what up?

18:40.601 --> 18:42.135
<i>Wow! Denzel Washington?</i>

18:42.169 --> 18:43.907
(voice of denzel washington)
<i>I'm here, I'm present,</i>

18:43.942 --> 18:45.476
<i>and I will always
be around.</i>

18:45.952 --> 18:48.745
- <i>Lil' Jon?</i>
- (voice of Lil' Jon) <i>Yeah!</i>

18:48.813 --> 18:51.272
(voice of Barack Obama)
<i>Excuse me, Lil' Jon. Welcome, Ray.</i>

18:51.783 --> 18:53.918
<i>I'm glad to have you
on board.</i>

18:54.019 --> 18:57.355
Oh, [bleep]!
What's up, Barack Obama?

18:59.001 --> 19:00.180
Ahem!

19:00.248 --> 19:01.948
(chuckles)

19:02.016 --> 19:04.618
Wouldn't that be something
if Barack Obama just showed up?

19:06.087 --> 19:08.369
Your start-up paperwork's
right over here.

19:09.908 --> 19:12.390
(dramatic music)
<i>Man, you gotta be more careful.</i>

19:12.566 --> 19:14.100
<i>Learn to use the Shining.</i>

19:14.304 --> 19:15.730
<i>Tune in and out of it.</i>

19:18.744 --> 19:20.627
<i>And I'm sick of these
goddamn snakes...</i>

19:20.627 --> 19:23.064
- <i>Just give me the basketball!</i>
- <i>...on this goddamn plane!</i>

19:23.111 --> 19:25.379
<i>Here, yo, Coco, what
you want to drink, girl?</i>

19:25.479 --> 19:26.546
<i>Leo, what are you doing?</i>

19:26.546 --> 19:28.714
<i>Drink some colt 45 malt liquor.</i>

19:28.781 --> 19:31.540
(overlapping voices)
<i>Women dig chocolate!</i>

19:31.977 --> 19:33.112
Is everything okay?

19:33.157 --> 19:36.370
(dramatic music)
<i>Ray! Listen for Morgan.</i>

19:37.115 --> 19:39.960
<i>Morgan Freeman.
He will guide you.</i>

19:40.043 --> 19:42.338
(voice of Morgan Freeman)
<i>Listen to my voice, Ray.</i>

19:42.888 --> 19:46.533
<i>Now, just stay calm
and focus on that white man.</i>

19:46.577 --> 19:48.444
(exhales)

19:48.582 --> 19:50.650
<i>Everything's
going to be okay.</i>

19:50.752 --> 19:53.839
Once you finish up this paperwork,
bring it to Jennifer in my office.

19:57.175 --> 19:59.226
(voice of Morgan Freeman)
<i>Now, pick up that letter opener,</i>

20:00.111 --> 20:03.647
<i>and kill
that white man.</i>

20:07.081 --> 20:09.216
Have an amazing Halloween.

20:09.736 --> 20:11.815

20:11.900 --> 20:13.434

20:16.324 --> 20:19.993

20:20.479 --> 20:21.913
Close to your face!
- No, don't.

20:22.015 --> 20:23.616
We're not doing that.

20:24.365 --> 20:26.566

20:39.070 --> 20:40.403
Look at him,

20:40.471 --> 20:42.472
you look like Michael Jackson
