to help in a less... official capacity.

About what?

33:47.192 --> 33:49.236
This whole place. What is it?

33:49.319 --> 33:51.196
Well, I'm part of a
network of physicians

33:51.279 --> 33:54.657
trying to provide health coverage
where it's needed most.

33:54.741 --> 33:56.242
Where people can't get to it.

33:56.492 --> 33:58.578
But we already have a clinic on the rez.

33:58.828 --> 34:00.538
And the doctor's only on call part time.

34:00.621 --> 34:02.415
I'm not faulting IHS,
but that's not enough

34:02.498 --> 34:04.042
for the people who live around here.

34:04.292 --> 34:06.002
So, you have a doctor
here 24 hours a day?

34:06.252 --> 34:10.005
No. It's just me and sometimes
my physician's assistant.

34:10.089 --> 34:13.217
We can only handle 60
or 70 hours a week,

34:13.384 --> 34:16.429
but we make sure that we stay open
when the other clinic isn't,

34:16.512 --> 34:19.014
and we move so that people
who don't have a car can get here.

34:21.016 --> 34:22.726
So, if you are all about access,

34:22.810 --> 34:25.063

34:40.078 --> 34:42.246
No. But I'm certainly
not gonna answer you.

I know all about doctor/patient privacy.

Well, I'm a friend of his mother,

34:53.674 --> 34:55.592
He has had some problems
with substance abuse.

34:55.842 --> 34:59.305
Well, I can't tell you
what he was here for.

34:59.389 --> 35:04.060
But I can tell you that among
the many services that we provide here,

35:04.144 --> 35:06.854
therapy for drug addiction
is one of them.

35:07.855 --> 35:09.440
Like methadone.

35:12.193 --> 35:13.861
So, I have Catori's cell number.

35:13.944 --> 35:17.281
I guess you could start by tracing that
since she's not answering my calls.

35:17.365 --> 35:20.910
And, I don't know,
she lives in a pretty remote area.

35:20.993 --> 35:24.831
Not a ton of neighbors, so if you wanted
to break into her house, you could...

35:25.080 --> 35:27.416
Well, if... if Catori's hiding,

35:27.500 --> 35:30.461
then she's probably not
gonna be in her house.

35:30.711 --> 35:34.340
No. Right. Of course.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.843
But maybe you could find, like,
some credit card bills,

35:37.927 --> 35:39.345
and then you could see if she's made

35:39.428 --> 35:42.265
- any recent purchases.
- [STUTTERS] Um, I should...

35:42.348 --> 35:43.975
I should have probably mentioned this.

35:44.225 --> 35:45.768
I'm not gonna break the law,

35:46.394 --> 35:52.233
which, so far, pretty much rules out
everything you've suggested.

35:56.612 --> 35:57.780
What can you do, then?

35:58.030 --> 36:01.367
Well, in truth, phone calls,
credit card bills,

36:01.450 --> 36:03.327
they very rarely tell us
anything of interest.

36:04.370 --> 36:07.748
I think a better approach to policing
is just to focus on Catori.

Who does she trust?
