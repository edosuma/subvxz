WEBVTT

00:02.524 --> 00:04.395
Cheers.

00:04.482 --> 00:05.918
Can we get
another round of martinis

00:06.006 --> 00:08.182
when you get a second?
- No, no more for me.

00:08.269 --> 00:09.661
Oh, come on.

00:09.748 --> 00:11.446
It took me six months
to get you here.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.230
Stay for one more.

00:13.317 --> 00:15.276
You're right.
It's been too long.

00:15.363 --> 00:18.453
It's just work's been crazy,
and Luke's

00:18.540 --> 00:21.151
starting school this year.
- Already?

00:21.238 --> 00:22.718
I swear,
the last time I saw him,

00:22.805 --> 00:24.372
he was still a baby.

00:24.459 --> 00:26.896
Oh, he is
a full little person now.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.463
I had to put the camera
back in his room.

00:28.550 --> 00:30.030
He's been getting up
in the middle of the night

00:30.117 --> 00:31.335
and getting out
all his books or toys.

00:31.422 --> 00:32.728
Oh.

00:32.815 --> 00:34.295
Of course, the one night
I go out,

00:34.382 --> 00:36.340
he is out like a light.

00:36.427 --> 00:38.995
He is getting so big.

00:39.082 --> 00:40.953
I know.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.390
Who is that?

00:46.263 --> 00:48.091
I--uh...

00:48.178 --> 00:50.485
I--I don't know.

00:50.572 --> 00:52.748
Quick, give me your phone.

01:03.498 --> 01:04.977
Hello?

01:05.065 --> 01:06.849
<i>Carmen,
there's a man in Luke's room.</i>

01:06.936 --> 01:07.937
- What?
- There's a man.

01:08.024 --> 01:09.765
I can see him on the camera.

01:16.511 --> 01:18.600
<i>Can you see him?</i>

01:21.342 --> 01:22.821
Carmen.

01:40.404 --> 01:42.363
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.887
- You with me tonight?
- I guess so.

01:44.974 --> 01:46.367
You doing OK?

01:46.454 --> 01:47.977
OA said that you went
to the doctor.

01:48.064 --> 01:51.372
You weren't feeling well?
- I'm fine.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.896
The intruder broke in
around 10:10 p.m.,

01:53.983 --> 01:56.028
broke that glass, and came
through that back door.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.987
OK, are there any
external cameras out there?

01:58.074 --> 02:00.076
No, the house
has an alarm system,

02:00.163 --> 02:01.643
but the kid's mother,
Liza Peters, she was out,

02:01.730 --> 02:02.905
So it hadn't
been activated yet.

02:02.992 --> 02:04.559
OK.

02:04.646 --> 02:05.690
The abductor comes
through the kitchen

02:05.777 --> 02:08.563
and goes up these stairs,
kills the nanny,

02:08.650 --> 02:11.131
and takes five-year-old
Luke Peters from his bed.

02:11.218 --> 02:14.134
OK, what do we know
about the victim?

02:14.221 --> 02:17.093
Not much.
Carmen Hernandez, 34.

02:17.180 --> 02:18.834
Lived in Queens,
worked full-time

02:18.921 --> 02:20.357
as the family's nanny.

02:20.444 --> 02:22.968
Crazy thing is Mom knew
the guy was in the house

02:23.055 --> 02:25.232
before she did,
saw it on the baby monitor.

02:25.319 --> 02:27.712
- This thing recording?
- No.

02:27.799 --> 02:30.280
Apparently, it just has
a live feed, no playback.

02:30.367 --> 02:33.109
OK, where's the mom?

02:33.196 --> 02:37.679
I couldn't see much.
The man was across the room.

02:37.766 --> 02:39.985
OK, do you remember
how tall he was

02:40.072 --> 02:41.683
or what color hair he had?

02:41.770 --> 02:45.600
He was wearing
a black tracksuit jacket.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.471
I'm sorry.
That's all I could see.

02:47.558 --> 02:48.907
That's OK.

02:48.994 --> 02:51.345
Just you
and Luke living here?

02:51.432 --> 02:53.782
What about his father?
He in the picture?

02:53.869 --> 02:55.000
When he can be.
We're not together.

02:55.087 --> 02:56.306
He lives in London.

02:56.393 --> 02:57.960
So you two have
a cordial relationship?

02:58.047 --> 02:59.527
Yes, we're good friends.

02:59.614 --> 03:01.964
So there is
no chance that he--?

03:02.051 --> 03:04.009
No.

03:04.096 --> 03:08.927
We had our differences,
but, no, John's a good person.

03:09.014 --> 03:11.408
He'd never do
anything like this.

03:11.495 --> 03:13.628
Can you think of anybody
that might?

03:13.715 --> 03:15.586
Anyone who'd shoot my nanny
and kidnap my son?

03:15.673 --> 03:18.067
No.

03:18.154 --> 03:20.243
I can't believe this
is really happening.

03:20.330 --> 03:23.768
I know.
I'm--I'm really sorry.

03:23.855 --> 03:26.467
OK, so the first thing
we're gonna need

03:26.554 --> 03:28.208
is a sample of Luke's DNA,

03:28.295 --> 03:29.426
so if you have
a toothbrush, a comb--

03:29.513 --> 03:31.167
Yeah, sure.

03:31.254 --> 03:32.864
And we're also going to need
to monitor your phone lines.

03:32.951 --> 03:34.475
Is that OK?

03:34.562 --> 03:36.303
Yeah, of course,
whatever you need.

03:36.390 --> 03:39.784
I just want my son back.

03:39.871 --> 03:41.090
All right, morning, folks.

03:41.177 --> 03:42.309
On the docket today,

03:42.396 --> 03:43.962
we've got a regular
horror story,

03:44.049 --> 03:45.790
every parent's worst nightmare.

03:45.877 --> 03:48.097
Five-year-old Luke Peters
was taken from his house

03:48.184 --> 03:49.925
a little after 10:00 p.m.
last night,

03:50.012 --> 03:51.492
which means he's been missing
for eight hours.

03:51.579 --> 03:53.189
We have no footage,
no witnesses,

03:53.276 --> 03:55.583
except the mother,
who got a glimpse of the perp

03:55.670 --> 03:57.106
on the nanny cam.

03:57.193 --> 03:59.369
Not a lot of detail
'cause he was in the dark,

03:59.456 --> 04:01.284
which is precisely
where we are,

04:01.371 --> 04:03.243
so let's get to work
and start shedding some light

04:03.330 --> 04:05.810
on this, yeah?
Thank you very much.

04:05.897 --> 04:07.943
Kelly, light me up.
- Ballistics report.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.640
Bullets that killed
the nanny, Carmen,

04:09.727 --> 04:11.599
were from a 9-millimeter,
but there's no match

04:11.686 --> 04:13.078
in the system.
- Right, OK.

04:13.165 --> 04:14.123
So we need agents
going door-to-door

04:14.210 --> 04:15.559
in the Peters' neighborhood.

04:15.646 --> 04:17.169
Ethan, you want
to take care of that?

04:17.257 --> 04:18.388
Make sure you dig into

04:18.475 --> 04:20.085
the local
sex offender registry, yeah?

04:20.172 --> 04:22.087
So what do we know
about the family?

04:22.174 --> 04:25.526
Luke lives with the mother,
Liza Peters, in Ditmas Park.

04:25.613 --> 04:27.092
She's a partner
at a consulting firm

04:27.179 --> 04:29.138
in Midtown, JBD Management.

04:29.225 --> 04:31.836
- And what about the father?
- John Bryant, 43.

04:31.923 --> 04:34.274
He works for a private
equity firm in London.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.928
So he lives in London,
and the wife lives in New York?

04:37.015 --> 04:38.060
That is because
they're divorced

04:38.147 --> 04:39.540
but on good terms.

04:39.627 --> 04:41.672
He seems happily remarried
to a woman named Andrea.

04:41.759 --> 04:43.239
Yeah, he's actually
on his way to New York.

04:43.326 --> 04:44.806
He should be here
in about seven hours or so.

04:44.893 --> 04:46.547
All right, so let's assume
Luke's abduction

04:46.634 --> 04:48.810
is not connected to the father.
What do we know about Liza?

04:48.897 --> 04:51.769
Does she have any skeletons
in the closet, any enemies?

04:51.856 --> 04:53.293
Doesn't appear that way.

04:53.380 --> 04:55.295
We've been through
her phone records, financials.

04:55.382 --> 04:56.513
No red flags popping anywhere.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.210
I mean,
if it's a pure money grab,

04:58.298 --> 04:59.690
there are much better targets
out there.

04:59.777 --> 05:00.952
Plus, we haven't seen
anything in the way

05:01.039 --> 05:02.954
of a ransom demand--
not yet, anyway.

05:03.041 --> 05:05.087
So why take this little boy?
What's the endgame?

05:05.174 --> 05:06.828
Thanks.

05:06.915 --> 05:08.525
ERT just pulled
three clean prints

05:08.612 --> 05:10.658
from the back door
of Liza's house.

05:10.745 --> 05:12.877
Let there be light.

05:12.964 --> 05:16.664
Thanks.
Hey, Liza?

05:16.751 --> 05:19.928
Hi, do you mind if we ask you
a few questions?

05:20.015 --> 05:22.583
Yeah, I was just--

05:28.980 --> 05:31.026
So we found
three fingerprints

05:31.113 --> 05:34.943
from the abductor's entrance--
yours, Carmen's, and this guy,

05:35.030 --> 05:36.684
Thomas Mitchum.

05:40.818 --> 05:42.342
I take it you know who he is.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.387
Yeah, that's
Carmen's ex-boyfriend.

05:44.474 --> 05:47.347
He's a drug addict and a thief.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.740
He stole my watch
three months ago,

05:49.827 --> 05:51.220
which I tried to overlook
because of Carmen.

05:51.307 --> 05:53.091
OK, are him and Carmen
still in touch?

05:53.178 --> 05:55.006
I don't think so.

05:55.093 --> 05:56.268
So there would be
no legitimate reason

05:56.356 --> 05:57.487
for him to be here last night?
- No.

05:57.574 --> 05:59.184
I made it clear to Carmen

05:59.271 --> 06:00.664
I never wanted
to see him again,

06:00.751 --> 06:02.840
and I sure as hell
didn't want him near my son.

06:02.927 --> 06:05.669
Oh, my God.
Thomas took Luke

06:05.756 --> 06:08.237
It's OK.
It's OK.

06:08.324 --> 06:11.371
Any idea where Thomas Mitchum
might be staying?

06:11.458 --> 06:14.591
Yes, I dropped Carmen off
there once.

06:14.678 --> 06:17.159
He was living
at his aunt's house.

06:17.246 --> 06:20.162
It was right near
the cemetery in Maspeth.

06:28.083 --> 06:29.824
In position.

06:29.911 --> 06:30.999
<i>Copy that, stand by.</i>

06:36.439 --> 06:38.920
We're gonna enter
as quietly as possible.

06:39.007 --> 06:40.965
We have no way of confirming
that Mitchum is working alone,

06:41.052 --> 06:43.359
and we do not want to alert
anyone to our presence.

06:43.446 --> 06:46.144
We make a sound,
it could get this kid killed.

06:46.231 --> 06:48.625
<i>I've got eyes on Mitchum.</i>

06:48.712 --> 06:51.802
He's moving around
the front of the house.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.195
<i>Southeast corner.</i>

07:13.868 --> 07:16.000
All right, Mitchum is
headed to the back room.

07:39.023 --> 07:40.764
<i>I think he heard you.</i>

07:40.851 --> 07:42.462
Mitchum is headed your way.

07:45.073 --> 07:49.425
Mitchum, don't move!
Hands up.

07:49.512 --> 07:50.513
<i>We got Mitchum
in the living room.</i>

07:53.516 --> 07:55.170
Hey!

07:58.173 --> 08:00.436
Hey.
- Luke?

08:00.523 --> 08:02.917
Freeze!
I said drop it.

08:03.004 --> 08:04.440
Hands up.
On your feet now.

08:04.527 --> 08:05.963
Back up towards me.

08:06.050 --> 08:08.488
Luke?
Hey, buddy?

08:08.575 --> 08:10.664
Luke?
- Back up.

08:13.057 --> 08:16.583
Luke?
Hey, buddy?

08:16.670 --> 08:18.498
It's okay.
You can come out.

08:20.456 --> 08:21.805
Glock 19, 9-millimeter.

08:21.892 --> 08:24.155
- I can explain.
- Anyone else in the house?

08:24.242 --> 08:25.505
No.
What the hell is this?

08:25.592 --> 08:27.855
- Come on.
- Luke?

08:30.074 --> 08:31.815
Hey!
He's not here.

08:31.902 --> 08:34.122
The kid's not here.
Mitchum, where is he?

08:34.209 --> 08:36.254
Where the hell is Luke Peters?

08:45.307 --> 08:46.526
I don't know where Luke is.
I didn't take him.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.571
Seriously,
what would I do with a kid?

08:48.658 --> 08:51.139
We know that you
were there last night.

08:55.970 --> 08:58.799
Is that Carmen?
- Yes.

08:58.886 --> 09:01.410
- What happened?
- Why don't you tell us?

09:01.497 --> 09:02.890
What do you mean?

09:02.977 --> 09:04.500
We found
your prints at the scene.

09:04.587 --> 09:06.546
Then today,
we find you with a gun, so--

09:06.633 --> 09:08.983
No, I didn't kill Carmen.
I loved her.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.767
I have three
domestic violence reports

09:10.854 --> 09:13.335
that say otherwise.
- That was a long time ago.

09:15.729 --> 09:18.819
Look, I'm not perfect,
but I didn't kill her.

09:21.517 --> 09:24.607
So what happened?
Why were you there last night?

09:24.694 --> 09:27.218
We was just hanging out,
like Carmen and I always do.

09:27.305 --> 09:30.657
We--
- Like you always do?

09:30.744 --> 09:33.964
I wait till she puts
Luke to bed, then I go over,

09:34.051 --> 09:35.444
then I leave before
Liza gets back.

09:35.531 --> 09:37.011
I thought you and Carmen
weren't dating anymore.

09:37.098 --> 09:38.490
- Says who?
- Liza.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.753
Well, she's wrong.

09:41.711 --> 09:45.193
Carmen probably
just didn't want her to know.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.412
So how late
were you there last night?

09:47.499 --> 09:50.198
I don't know.
A little after 10:00.

09:50.285 --> 09:51.765
OK, did you notice anyone
else in the neighborhood

09:51.852 --> 09:54.115
when you left?
- No.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.858
There was a car.

09:57.945 --> 10:00.034
It was parked out at the curb
about a block from the house.

10:01.688 --> 10:02.514
Guys were just sitting in it.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.168
What kind of car?

10:04.255 --> 10:08.259
I don't know, um,
it was a black sedan,

10:08.346 --> 10:12.263
but I remember that
their left tail light was out.

10:12.350 --> 10:13.874
I thought about going
and telling them,

10:13.961 --> 10:15.440
but it was already so late.

10:22.186 --> 10:25.233
- How are we doing, Elise?
- Still looking.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.887
There's no cameras
near where the car was parked.

10:26.974 --> 10:28.453
Ballistics
from Mitchum's gun

10:28.540 --> 10:30.151
weren't a match for the bullets
that killed Carmen.

10:30.238 --> 10:31.500
It looks like
we're back to square one.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.328
Hey, I got video
of the black sedan.

10:33.415 --> 10:34.634
Yeah.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.374
This is at 9:58 p.m.,

10:36.461 --> 10:38.246
12 minutes before
Liza's 911 call.

10:38.333 --> 10:41.379
Yeah, can we
run those plates?

10:41.466 --> 10:43.512
They're bogus, come back
to a Toyota Highlander.

10:43.599 --> 10:44.644
OK.
So what?

10:44.731 --> 10:47.559
Rewind it.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.562
All right, so it looks like
there's four, maybe five guys.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.435
Can you see if you can get
a shot of the driver or no?

10:55.263 --> 10:57.308
OK, black hat, track suit.

10:57.395 --> 10:58.527
It's got to be the guy
Liza saw on the nanny cam.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.398
I want IDs
on everybody in that car.

11:00.485 --> 11:02.357
OK, I'll try, but most
of them are in the shadow.

11:02.444 --> 11:03.880
Can you track them
back any further,

11:03.967 --> 11:05.273
try to get a better angle?
- Yeah, we're looking.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.318
We're looking.

11:07.405 --> 11:08.493
All right, come on,
come on, come on, let's go.

11:08.580 --> 11:11.105
What are we seeing?

11:11.192 --> 11:13.150
- I got 'em.
- Yeah?

11:13.237 --> 11:15.283
They stopped at a food cart
half a mile back.

11:15.370 --> 11:16.893
Still not a great
look into the vehicle,

11:16.980 --> 11:18.678
but I think I can
get the driver.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.331
Yeah, hey, better an egg
today than a hen tomorrow.

11:20.418 --> 11:22.812
Come on.
Let's see, come on.

11:24.553 --> 11:28.035
Boom.
- OK.

11:28.122 --> 11:30.385
OK, eyes up, people.

11:30.472 --> 11:33.214
Akhmad Petrov,
43-year-old Chechen national.

11:33.301 --> 11:35.085
He's on Interpol's
most wanted list,

11:35.172 --> 11:36.304
runs some group called

11:36.391 --> 11:37.740
the Chechen Revolutionary Regiment.

11:37.827 --> 11:39.394
Yeah, that's a fancy name

11:39.481 --> 11:41.526
for a terrorist organization.
These guys are legit.

11:41.613 --> 11:44.573
They're responsible for
several high-profile bombings

11:44.660 --> 11:46.836
and political assassinations
throughout Eastern Europe.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.446
So what the hell do
a bunch of Chechen terrorists

11:48.533 --> 11:49.926
want with
a five-year-old kid

11:50.013 --> 11:52.363
named Luke from Brooklyn?

11:54.409 --> 11:56.977
Chechen terrorists?
That's who took Luke?

11:57.978 --> 11:59.980
Yeah.

12:00.067 --> 12:03.157
That doesn't make any sense.
I mean, he's just a little boy.

12:03.244 --> 12:04.985
Why the hell would they--

12:05.072 --> 12:06.682
We were hoping
you could tell us.

12:06.769 --> 12:09.554
- I--
- OK.

12:09.641 --> 12:13.123
This is Akhmad Petrov.

12:13.210 --> 12:15.212
He's the man from the video.

12:15.299 --> 12:19.651
And these are some
of his known associates.

12:19.739 --> 12:23.655
Here.
Can you look through this?

12:23.743 --> 12:26.876
Take your time and let us know
if you recognize any of them.

12:41.282 --> 12:42.892
No.

12:44.459 --> 12:46.940
No, this has to be
a mistake, right?

12:47.027 --> 12:48.115
I mean,
it doesn't make any sense.

12:48.202 --> 12:49.377
No.
No, it doesn't.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.901
These men
are professional terrorists.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.337
They wouldn't expose themself

12:53.424 --> 12:55.775
if they didn't think
it was worth the risk.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.428
So what are you saying?

12:57.515 --> 13:00.127
I'm saying it just
doesn't exactly feel random.

13:02.651 --> 13:04.871
You've never had any contact
with any of those men?

13:04.958 --> 13:06.220
No.

13:06.307 --> 13:07.612
What about
your professional life?

13:07.699 --> 13:08.657
You ever worked
for any companies

13:08.744 --> 13:10.180
based in Eastern Europe?

13:10.267 --> 13:11.965
Maybe,
but nothing that interesting.

13:12.052 --> 13:13.357
I mean, certainly nothing
that would cause

13:13.444 --> 13:15.751
a terror group
to kidnap my son.

13:15.838 --> 13:19.537
Can you elaborate on that,
"nothing that interesting?"

13:22.149 --> 13:23.803
Am I
under investigation here?

13:23.890 --> 13:25.892
No, OK?
Not at all.

13:25.979 --> 13:28.416
Then what is this?

13:28.503 --> 13:30.984
I don't know who these men are
or why they took my son.

13:31.071 --> 13:33.769
That's why I called you.

13:33.856 --> 13:36.380
You should be out there
looking for him

13:36.467 --> 13:39.731
instead of accusing me of--
what exactly?

13:39.819 --> 13:42.256
OK, we're just--
we're just trying to understand

13:42.343 --> 13:46.303
how they're connected.
That's all.

13:46.390 --> 13:50.786
Um, if you think of anything,
please call us.

14:01.753 --> 14:04.104
What the hell was that?
- Oh, come on.

14:04.191 --> 14:05.888
She recognized
the men in the photos.

14:05.975 --> 14:07.585
You saw that.
That's why she got defensive.

14:07.672 --> 14:10.110
No, she's in shock, OK?

14:10.197 --> 14:12.155
We just told her that her son
is being held by terrorists.

14:12.242 --> 14:14.114
Can you imagine what that must
feel like for a parent?

14:14.201 --> 14:15.680
That must be awful.
I get it.

14:15.767 --> 14:18.814
But there's something off
with her.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.773
I can feel it.

14:21.861 --> 14:25.516
What?
- There's nothing off, OK?

14:25.603 --> 14:27.344
She's a mother,
and she's scared.

14:27.431 --> 14:29.259
I'm surprised you can't
really relate to that.

14:29.346 --> 14:31.305
Of course I can relate to it,
but that's not my job

14:31.392 --> 14:32.872
to relate to a mother
going through

14:32.959 --> 14:35.700
a horrible situation.
I'm trying to find her son.

14:37.137 --> 14:38.790
It's Jubal.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.097
NYPD helicopter just spotted
Petrov's car heading west

14:41.184 --> 14:42.577
on the Long Island Expressway.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.105
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
There's his car.

14:49.192 --> 14:50.715
I see him.

14:50.802 --> 14:52.500
We've got eyes
on the suspect's vehicle

14:52.587 --> 14:54.458
on 43rd Avenue
turning south on 9th Street.

14:54.545 --> 14:57.635
Copy that.
We're on our way.

15:03.772 --> 15:04.991
Ah, damn it.
We're burned.

15:05.078 --> 15:06.296
Be advised.
The suspect is fleeing.

15:06.383 --> 15:07.732
We're in pursuit.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

15:41.462 --> 15:43.159
We were right behind him.
He couldn't have gotten far.

15:54.214 --> 15:56.999
Tiff, I think I got something.

15:57.086 --> 15:58.435
- Hey!
- Whoa, oh--

16:00.176 --> 16:01.090
Shots fired.
FBI! Don't move!

16:03.614 --> 16:05.051
Let's go.

16:05.138 --> 16:06.574
Suspect is
headed down 9th Street,

16:06.661 --> 16:09.011
stolen motorbike, black jacket.
- Copy that.

16:50.226 --> 16:52.750
It's not Petrov.

16:56.493 --> 16:58.452
All right, thank you.

16:58.539 --> 17:00.193
Thank you. Hey.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.629
Anything?

17:01.716 --> 17:03.196
I found some brown hairs
in the back seat.

17:03.283 --> 17:04.458
Let's get the lab to run it
against Luke's DNA.

17:04.545 --> 17:06.329
Maybe we'll get a match.

17:06.416 --> 17:09.202
Were we able
to identify our suspect?

17:09.289 --> 17:11.291
Anzor Taramov,
Chechen national

17:11.378 --> 17:12.770
and suspected member
of the CRR.

17:20.952 --> 17:23.564
I got a bodega receipt.

17:23.651 --> 17:25.740
Two days ago.
West 14th Street and 7th Ave.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.180
Hey, receipt OA found
was from the purchase

17:31.267 --> 17:32.529
of two burner phones.

17:32.616 --> 17:34.357
Storage just sent
the serial numbers.

17:34.444 --> 17:35.315
Can we get
a location on them?

17:35.402 --> 17:36.881
Ian's working on it.

17:36.968 --> 17:38.492
Hairs in the Impala
are a match to Luke Peters,

17:38.579 --> 17:40.407
so our victim
was definitely in that car.

17:40.494 --> 17:42.713
All right, it means we're
fishing in the right pond.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.454
Talk to me, Ian.

17:44.541 --> 17:45.542
Location services
have been shut off.

17:45.629 --> 17:46.587
What about
the carrier services--

17:46.674 --> 17:47.849
call logs, text messages?

17:47.936 --> 17:49.285
There's not
a lot of activity.

17:49.372 --> 17:50.765
The messaging is going
through an encrypted app.

17:50.852 --> 17:52.288
The only calls that they've
made have been to each other.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.508
So we have no way
of tracking them.

17:54.595 --> 17:55.857
Well, let's do it
the old-fashioned way.

17:55.944 --> 17:57.119
Let's call them
and see where they ping.

17:57.206 --> 17:58.860
I'm on it.

18:11.612 --> 18:13.744
First phone is shut off.
Trying second number now.

18:20.142 --> 18:21.665
<i>Hello?</i>

18:26.714 --> 18:29.238
<i>I know you're there.
No need to be concerned.</i>

18:29.325 --> 18:31.458
<i>I'll be there on time, but you
need to deliver proof of life.</i>

18:31.545 --> 18:33.373
<i>I need to know
that my son is OK.</i>

18:33.460 --> 18:37.464
<i>You hear me?
Do you hear me?</i>

18:39.596 --> 18:40.771
That was definitely
the boy's mother.

18:40.858 --> 18:42.817
She's asking about her son.

18:42.904 --> 18:45.036
Which means this case
makes even less sense

18:45.124 --> 18:47.430
than it did five minutes ago.

18:54.611 --> 18:55.612
All right, so we now
have evidence Liza Peters

18:55.699 --> 18:57.440
is in direct contact
with her son's abductors,

18:57.527 --> 18:58.833
which means
that she's been lying to us

18:58.920 --> 19:00.574
from the jump,
but we're gonna talk to her

19:00.661 --> 19:01.966
and see what's going on.

19:02.053 --> 19:03.185
I assume she's still
in her house, right?

19:03.272 --> 19:04.795
Well, she just
shut off her burner,

19:04.882 --> 19:05.970
but yeah, that call we
just made pinged to her house.

19:06.057 --> 19:07.233
- Yeah.
- OK.

19:07.320 --> 19:07.755
I just spoke to
the agents on site.

19:07.842 --> 19:09.409
She's not there.

19:09.496 --> 19:10.105
Well, they didn't
just let her leave.

19:10.192 --> 19:11.280
Do we know her location?

19:11.367 --> 19:12.760
Well, she said
she was gonna take a nap

19:12.847 --> 19:14.109
and climbed out the window,

19:14.196 --> 19:15.197
and they were holding on
to her personal cell

19:15.284 --> 19:16.503
in case a ransom call came in.

19:16.590 --> 19:17.982
They didn't know
she was a flight risk.

19:18.069 --> 19:20.594
OK, we need to put out
a BOLO right away.

19:20.681 --> 19:22.509
In the meantime,
let's get a search warrant.

19:22.596 --> 19:24.163
ERT already
searched her house.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.512
Yeah, they did
a forensic sweep

19:25.599 --> 19:27.253
after the abduction,

19:27.340 --> 19:29.864
but they weren't
focused on Liza.

19:32.910 --> 19:34.912
Encryption is tight.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.827
The thing is harder
to get into than Fort Knox.

19:36.914 --> 19:38.699
Keep trying, OK?

19:38.786 --> 19:40.222
We know
that she used it earlier today.

19:42.833 --> 19:45.140
Any luck?
- No, nothing.

19:45.227 --> 19:47.577
Just a bunch
of boring documents

19:47.664 --> 19:50.580
and paperwork
like old pediatrician records

19:50.667 --> 19:54.149
and bank statements,
loan statements.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.630
OK, and yet this boring woman

19:56.717 --> 20:00.547
lied to the FBI and climbs out
of her window to meet up

20:00.634 --> 20:03.332
with the Chechen terrorists.
It just doesn't make any sense.

20:03.419 --> 20:05.465
Well, of course it does.
She wants to save her son.

20:05.552 --> 20:08.729
Yeah, I get that,
but why lie to us?

20:08.816 --> 20:13.777
And why sneak out?
- Oh.

20:15.736 --> 20:17.868
Whew, sorry.
I'm--

20:17.955 --> 20:21.220
- Hey, hey, are you OK?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

20:21.307 --> 20:25.702
I'm just--I'm so dizzy.

20:25.789 --> 20:28.792
Yeah, I just--
I just need some space, OK?

20:28.879 --> 20:30.098
Please just--

20:30.185 --> 20:33.841
OK, OK.

20:39.063 --> 20:41.240
What is that?

20:41.327 --> 20:43.938
- What?
- Do you see that?

20:50.858 --> 20:52.773
It's a safe.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.274
Oh, sweet.
OK, thanks.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.145
- Yeah.
- OK.

21:17.232 --> 21:21.105
- Let's see what we got.
- Yeah.

21:21.192 --> 21:24.283
OK.
Cash, credit cards.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.807
What, passports?
- Mm-hmm.

21:26.894 --> 21:28.722
Six of them?

21:28.809 --> 21:31.420
All belonging to Liza.

21:31.507 --> 21:34.031
Or Maria or Diana or Larissa.

21:36.643 --> 21:38.514
Who is this woman?

21:41.038 --> 21:43.084
Liza Peters
has six passports,

21:43.171 --> 21:45.521
from four separate countries,
all under different names.

21:45.608 --> 21:47.741
And based on early analysis,
they're not forgeries.

21:47.828 --> 21:49.482
They're genuine,
government-issued documents.

21:49.569 --> 21:51.484
The first question is,
which one is real?

21:51.571 --> 21:52.876
Well, it seems
like Liza Peters

21:52.963 --> 21:54.443
is her real identity.

21:54.530 --> 21:55.792
We've got a birth certificate,
yearbook photos

21:55.879 --> 21:57.228
dating back 30 years.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.273
So how did the others
come into play?

21:58.360 --> 21:59.492
Where'd she get them?

21:59.579 --> 22:00.884
Don't know,
but the Russian passport

22:00.971 --> 22:02.669
under the name Maria Laskin
could explain

22:02.756 --> 22:04.279
her connection to Petrov.

22:04.366 --> 22:06.107
She logged 13 trips
from New York to Chechnya

22:06.194 --> 22:08.109
under that identity.

22:08.196 --> 22:09.589
And we don't have any idea
of what she was doing there?

22:09.676 --> 22:11.678
No, customs marked the trip
as personal.

22:11.765 --> 22:14.071
All the other passports show
similar patterns of travel,

22:14.158 --> 22:15.899
all marked personal as well.

22:15.986 --> 22:17.510
Over the past 10 years,
she's spent months at a time

22:17.597 --> 22:19.860
in Moscow, Bucharest, Warsaw.

22:19.947 --> 22:21.688
Yeah, those are all
intelligence hubs.

22:21.775 --> 22:23.385
She's a spy, no doubt.
- Yeah.

22:23.472 --> 22:25.256
Tony, Ann, how we doing?
We need answers.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.867
Does Liza Peters work
for one of your agencies?

22:26.954 --> 22:28.738
If she's a covert agent,
I don't have access

22:28.825 --> 22:30.392
to that information.
- She's with us.

22:30.479 --> 22:32.960
- Yeah?
- She's CIA.

22:33.047 --> 22:35.745
High-level covert operative,
top secret and SEI clearances.

22:35.832 --> 22:37.878
She's been
with the agency since 2004.

22:39.662 --> 22:40.924
We're gonna need to speak
with your supervisor ASAP.

22:41.011 --> 22:42.622
I'll set it up.

22:47.278 --> 22:49.106
How you feeling?

22:49.193 --> 22:50.978
I'm fine.

22:51.065 --> 22:52.371
Yeah, but you almost
passed out back at the house.

22:52.458 --> 22:53.720
It looked like you
were in some real pain.

22:53.807 --> 22:56.505
- I'm just feeling off.
- Yeah.

22:56.592 --> 22:59.116
No, I noticed.
So what's up?

22:59.203 --> 23:01.380
What did the doctor say?

23:01.467 --> 23:03.338
I don't really want
to talk about it.

23:03.425 --> 23:05.775
Nina, you're making me
nervous here.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.473
Look, if there's
something going on--

23:10.258 --> 23:11.390
I'm pregnant.

23:13.522 --> 23:14.436
You...

23:17.047 --> 23:18.745
You sure?

23:18.832 --> 23:22.792
Yeah, I'm sure.
Uh, found out last night.

23:22.879 --> 23:24.620
That's why
you went to the doctor?

23:24.707 --> 23:27.493
Yeah,
I thought I had the flu.

23:27.580 --> 23:30.626
I just didn't
consider that I was--

23:30.713 --> 23:32.367
Am I--?

23:32.454 --> 23:34.325
Yeah.

23:38.112 --> 23:42.072
And do you--
do you know if you're gonna--

23:42.159 --> 23:46.947
I don't know.
I don't know.

23:47.034 --> 23:48.818
Can we talk about this?

23:48.905 --> 23:50.254
Not right now, OK?

23:54.433 --> 23:56.565
Liza's supervisor is here, so...

24:00.700 --> 24:04.051
Liza Peters
was our best case officer

24:04.138 --> 24:05.879
in Eastern Europe.

24:05.966 --> 24:08.098
Was quick on her feet,
tough as nails.

24:08.185 --> 24:09.360
We were sorry to lose her

24:09.448 --> 24:10.405
in the field
when her son was born.

24:10.492 --> 24:11.928
She's not active anymore?

24:12.015 --> 24:14.844
No, she works primarily
in a supervisory role now.

24:14.931 --> 24:16.716
But she was
working in Chechnya?

24:16.803 --> 24:18.065
For two years.

24:18.152 --> 24:19.283
She was working
a terrorist group

24:19.370 --> 24:21.982
called the CRR,
gathering intel.

24:22.069 --> 24:23.636
Why?

24:23.723 --> 24:25.855
Well, we think
that members of the CRR,

24:25.942 --> 24:27.378
including Akhmad Petrov,

24:27.466 --> 24:30.338
are responsible for
the abduction of Liza's son.

24:37.476 --> 24:40.174
What, you think
that Petrov abducted Luke?

24:40.261 --> 24:41.610
Yeah.

24:41.697 --> 24:44.831
Do you have any idea
why he would target her?

24:44.918 --> 24:46.963
No.

24:47.050 --> 24:49.096
As far as I know, Liza never
met Petrov personally.

24:50.837 --> 24:53.013
Unless he's looking
for Milena Kerimova.

24:53.100 --> 24:54.493
Who's that?

24:54.580 --> 24:57.278
A Chechen activist, propagandist.

24:57.365 --> 24:59.976
She's been rallying against
Petrov and the CRR for years.

25:00.063 --> 25:02.892
And what does she
have to do with Liza?

25:02.979 --> 25:05.416
Liza recruited her
to work for the CIA,

25:05.504 --> 25:08.245
but about six months ago,
things got hot.

25:08.332 --> 25:09.812
Her life was in danger,

25:09.899 --> 25:11.640
so we smuggled her
out of Chechnya

25:11.727 --> 25:13.337
and got her set up
here in New York.

25:13.424 --> 25:14.861
So if Petrov
wants to kill Kerimova,

25:14.948 --> 25:16.340
Liza is the one
that knows where she is.

25:16.427 --> 25:17.559
Is that what you're saying?

25:17.646 --> 25:19.169
Liza is in charge
of the safe house

25:19.256 --> 25:21.607
where Kerimova is secured.
- Which is where exactly?

25:21.694 --> 25:23.043
Long Island.

25:23.130 --> 25:26.307
OK, I assume you have agents
with Kerimova?

25:26.394 --> 25:27.961
I think you should call them,
tell them what's going on.

25:28.048 --> 25:30.833
Are you suggesting
that Liza would compromise

25:30.920 --> 25:32.008
her own asset's safety?

25:32.095 --> 25:35.055
To save her son, yeah.

25:41.888 --> 25:43.498
Can I help you?

25:43.585 --> 25:46.022
He's one of ours.

25:46.109 --> 25:48.547
Milena Kerimova,
we need to see her.

25:48.634 --> 25:50.418
What the hell is going on?

25:50.505 --> 25:52.028
Why are your phones off?

25:52.115 --> 25:54.553
Liza said there was
a security breach,

25:54.640 --> 25:55.945
told us to shut down communication

25:56.032 --> 25:56.642
until the transfer
was complete.

25:56.729 --> 25:57.773
What?
What transfer?

25:59.732 --> 26:02.169
- Milena Kerimova.
- Are you saying she's gone?

26:02.256 --> 26:04.650
Liza wanted to move her
to a more secure location.

26:04.737 --> 26:07.740
- When was this?
- About 15 minutes ago.

26:18.838 --> 26:19.926
Yeah, we got
a bit of a situation.

26:20.013 --> 26:21.754
Liza lied to her fellow agents,
told them

26:21.841 --> 26:24.104
there was a security breach
and she had to relocate

26:24.191 --> 26:25.409
the asset she was protecting.

26:25.496 --> 26:27.281
So we need answers.
Where is she?

26:27.368 --> 26:28.761
And more importantly,
where is she going?

26:28.848 --> 26:29.979
Elise, how are we
doing on the video?

26:30.066 --> 26:31.590
Here we go.

26:31.677 --> 26:34.593
This is from outside
the safe house 24 minutes ago.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.377
- Can we go tighter?
- Here's Liza.

26:46.169 --> 26:48.171
Doesn't she seem
kind of calm

26:48.258 --> 26:49.695
for someone who's about
to hand over her asset

26:49.782 --> 26:51.522
to a terrorist organization?

26:51.610 --> 26:53.176
Well, we don't know
if that's her plan.

26:53.263 --> 26:55.265
Right now, we need to find her.
What car is she driving?

26:55.352 --> 26:58.486
886LSMB.
OK, I'm running it.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.971
It's a rental,
picked up from a company

27:05.058 --> 27:08.496
two blocks from Liza's house
at 2:54 p.m.,

27:08.583 --> 27:11.934
paid for with a credit card
belonging to Nancy Lawson.

27:12.021 --> 27:14.415
Yeah, that's--I think that's
one of the aliases, right?

27:14.502 --> 27:17.897
Yeah, let's get a BOLO
out on that car, thanks.

27:17.984 --> 27:19.420
What about the car's GPS?

27:19.507 --> 27:20.813
Can the rental
company track it?

27:20.900 --> 27:23.511
Yeah, I'm on with them now.

27:23.598 --> 27:25.208
Yes, they think they can do it.
- Great.

27:25.295 --> 27:26.253
Get their location
over to Scola and Nina.

27:33.521 --> 27:34.914
There's movement
in the front seat.

27:35.001 --> 27:37.133
Liza Peters,
out of the car now!

27:45.359 --> 27:47.404
Where's Kerimova?

27:47.491 --> 27:49.798
In the back seat.

27:52.148 --> 27:53.497
She's fine.

27:53.584 --> 27:55.325
I just gave her
a mild sedative.

28:00.940 --> 28:03.116
You need to tell us
what the hell is going on.

28:03.203 --> 28:05.422
They gave me a choice,

28:05.509 --> 28:08.164
deliver Kerimova
or watch my son die

28:08.251 --> 28:10.297
a very painful death.

28:12.821 --> 28:15.171
These people--these animals,
they mean what they say.

28:15.258 --> 28:16.390
OK, so what?

28:16.477 --> 28:17.347
You were just gonna
deliver Kerimova

28:17.434 --> 28:19.088
and let them execute her?

28:19.175 --> 28:22.613
What the hell would you do,
watch your son get murdered?

28:22.701 --> 28:26.487
OK, but what, you couldn't,
so that's why you're here?

28:26.574 --> 28:27.662
OK, all right.

28:27.749 --> 28:28.968
So this is good, OK?

28:29.055 --> 28:32.188
We just--we need a plan.

28:32.275 --> 28:34.234
What is it
that Petrov's asking you to do?

28:34.321 --> 28:36.279
He wants Kerimova,
told me to meet him by 5:00

28:36.366 --> 28:37.933
or he'll kill Luke.

28:38.020 --> 28:39.239
OK, where are you supposed
to meet him?

28:39.326 --> 28:40.893
What's--what's
the exact location?

28:40.980 --> 28:43.809
Some old building
by the beach in Queens,

28:43.896 --> 28:46.028
but the meeting's less
than an hour from now, so--

28:46.115 --> 28:48.770
No, that's OK.
Actually, that's enough time.

28:48.857 --> 28:50.163
Well, we can't just show up,
hit the location,

28:50.250 --> 28:52.731
and hope that--
- I have a plan, OK?

28:52.818 --> 28:55.559
Look at her, right?
We look enough alike.

28:55.646 --> 28:57.474
I'll just go in her place.

28:57.561 --> 29:00.042
No, no, that is not a plan.
That is a death wish.

29:00.129 --> 29:01.130
You don't even speak
the language.

29:01.217 --> 29:02.436
Look,
all we need to do

29:02.523 --> 29:03.959
is keep the ruse alive
for long enough

29:04.046 --> 29:06.005
to get eyes on Luke, right?

29:06.092 --> 29:08.094
I mean, you know these guys.

29:08.181 --> 29:12.098
Do you think we can do it?
- It could work.

29:12.185 --> 29:13.708
OK, then I'll run it
up the flagpole.

29:13.795 --> 29:15.101
OK, hey, hey, hey.

29:15.188 --> 29:17.190
You understand
this is crazy, right?

29:17.277 --> 29:18.974
- It's our only play.
- No, Nina.

29:19.061 --> 29:20.584
I read this guy's file, OK?

29:20.671 --> 29:22.804
Petrov decapitated
his own brother.

29:22.891 --> 29:25.415
You cannot go into
a meeting with a person

29:25.502 --> 29:27.635
with less than an hour of prep.
- Well, it's our only move, OK?

29:27.722 --> 29:29.637
So back off.

29:48.656 --> 29:50.092
OK, we're too far away.

29:50.179 --> 29:51.354
I mean,
if anything goes sideways,

29:51.441 --> 29:52.616
we can't even get to them.

29:52.703 --> 29:54.662
We get any closer,
they'll see us.

29:59.319 --> 30:01.234
<i>OK, we have
a black, blue Dodge Durango,</i>

30:01.321 --> 30:04.933
license plate number 437HDVX.

30:07.457 --> 30:08.850
We're running it.

30:08.937 --> 30:10.721
It's cold plated.
Looks like an older model.

30:10.809 --> 30:11.853
We can't track that.

30:11.940 --> 30:13.246
Can we get eyes
on the inside?

30:13.333 --> 30:14.638
How many guys
we dealing with here?

30:14.725 --> 30:16.510
<i>I've got eyes
inside of the vehicle,</i>

30:16.597 --> 30:18.033
<i>but I only see one guy, and
it doesn't look like Petrov.</i>

30:18.120 --> 30:19.513
What about the little boy?

30:19.600 --> 30:21.297
No, I don't see him.

30:39.315 --> 30:41.665
It's not Petrov.

30:47.410 --> 30:49.673
Out of the car.

31:27.668 --> 31:29.322
Get in.

31:40.289 --> 31:42.161
Start the car.

31:44.554 --> 31:45.991
Where is my son?

31:46.078 --> 31:48.080
I'll take you to him.
Just do what I say.

31:48.167 --> 31:50.169
No, no, they changed
the plan, let's call it.

31:50.256 --> 31:51.648
If we arrest this guy now,

31:51.735 --> 31:53.172
Petrov's gonna know
that something went wrong,

31:53.259 --> 31:54.260
and he's gonna kill the kid
and cut his losses.

31:54.347 --> 31:55.696
Our best bet is to follow them.

31:55.783 --> 31:57.350
If they even come back.

31:57.437 --> 31:58.481
For all we know,
he could have them pull over

31:58.568 --> 31:59.569
at the side of the road
and shoot them both.

31:59.656 --> 32:01.354
Isobel.

32:01.441 --> 32:02.921
You know this guy
better than we do.

32:03.008 --> 32:04.923
Are we walking
into a trap here?

32:05.010 --> 32:06.446
I don't think so.

32:06.533 --> 32:08.143
Petrov will want to deal
with Kerimova himself,

32:08.230 --> 32:09.753
so I think they're safe--

32:09.840 --> 32:11.581
until they actually meet up
with him, anyway.

32:11.668 --> 32:13.583
Then, it's a toss-up.

32:15.759 --> 32:18.371
All right, we're gonna let
Liza and Nina make the call.

32:18.458 --> 32:19.981
It's their lives on the line.

32:20.068 --> 32:21.678
We're talking
about handing Nina over

32:21.765 --> 32:23.071
to an executioner here.

32:23.158 --> 32:24.986
If Nina wanted out,

32:25.073 --> 32:26.945
she would have
given us a signal.

32:29.817 --> 32:31.993
She's got this.

32:33.255 --> 32:35.127
I'm not going anywhere.

32:35.214 --> 32:36.737
I need to know my son's alive.

32:52.492 --> 32:53.406
Luke.

32:53.493 --> 32:55.669
<i>Mommy, I want to go home.</i>

32:55.756 --> 32:57.714
I know, honey, I know.
It's oK.

32:57.801 --> 32:59.890
I'm coming.
I'm on my way.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.631
Drive.

33:27.527 --> 33:29.877
Do we know where
they're headed yet?

33:29.964 --> 33:31.792
Somewhere in Long Island.

33:33.576 --> 33:35.361
We have a problem.

33:35.448 --> 33:36.579
<i>The licensed car just
turn down a private road.</i>

33:36.666 --> 33:38.581
If we follow it now,
our cover's gonna be blown.

33:38.668 --> 33:40.322
<i>No, no, no.
We don't know that.</i>

33:40.409 --> 33:41.454
If we pull them over
right now, we can spook them.

33:41.541 --> 33:43.586
It could get
Nina and Liza killed.

33:59.515 --> 34:01.300
Take it easy.

34:04.651 --> 34:05.608
Don't move.

35:11.935 --> 35:13.023
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm good.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.677
Tiff, how far out are y'all?

35:14.764 --> 35:15.983
<i>We're about
six minutes away.</i>

35:16.070 --> 35:17.506
<i>We have your location.</i>
- OK.

35:17.593 --> 35:19.291
Here.

35:20.422 --> 35:21.162
<i>OK, wait for backup
to make entry.</i>

35:21.249 --> 35:23.295
We will be there
in five minutes.

35:23.382 --> 35:24.470
OK.

35:24.557 --> 35:26.472
Liza, hey.
Where are you going?

35:26.559 --> 35:28.082
I'm not waiting.

35:28.169 --> 35:29.475
Come on.
They're close.

35:29.562 --> 35:30.693
We don't know how many
guys are in there, Liza.

35:30.780 --> 35:32.173
My son is in there.

35:32.260 --> 35:33.740
You do what you want.
I'm going in.

35:33.827 --> 35:35.133
Liza--Liza!

35:35.220 --> 35:36.656
No, Nina, wait for backup.

35:36.743 --> 35:38.701
<i>Nina!</i>

35:53.673 --> 35:55.283
Ah!

36:04.162 --> 36:05.380
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
He's down.

36:05.467 --> 36:06.599
Are you OK?

36:06.686 --> 36:07.730
I don't think
I can stand on it.

36:07.817 --> 36:08.601
OK.
Put pressure on it, OK?

36:08.688 --> 36:09.950
I'm gonna stay with you.

36:10.037 --> 36:12.126
- Mom!
- Luke?

36:12.213 --> 36:13.606
Stay where you are.

36:13.693 --> 36:14.607
Please, you have
to go find him.

36:14.694 --> 36:16.696
OK.

36:16.783 --> 36:17.958
Stay covered.

36:18.045 --> 36:19.699
I'll be back.

36:19.786 --> 36:21.788
Luke?

36:43.810 --> 36:46.378
Hey, hi.

36:47.596 --> 36:49.642
Hi.
My name is Nina, OK?

36:49.729 --> 36:51.470
I'm gonna take you--
- Step away from the child.

36:51.557 --> 36:53.863
Stay here.

36:53.950 --> 36:55.561
Step away from the child.

36:55.648 --> 36:57.824
OK, OK!

37:09.096 --> 37:10.315
Come here.
Come on.

37:10.402 --> 37:11.968
I'm gonna take you
to your mom, OK?

37:12.055 --> 37:13.840
Come here, buddy.

37:28.681 --> 37:30.117
OK.

37:30.204 --> 37:33.251
Give Mommy one last big hug,
then we have to go.

37:34.295 --> 37:36.384
Bye-bye, sweet boy.

37:40.083 --> 37:41.998
Be good for Daddy.

37:59.233 --> 38:02.105
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.021
I don't know how to thank you
for what you did in there.

38:05.108 --> 38:07.241
I know I put you at risk.

38:07.328 --> 38:09.591
It's all right.

38:09.678 --> 38:11.245
They're gonna take you
to the hospital,

38:11.332 --> 38:12.986
get your leg all fixed up, OK?

38:14.117 --> 38:16.903
And then what?

38:16.990 --> 38:19.297
They are gonna charge you
with the abduction of Kerimova

38:19.384 --> 38:20.776
and violation
of the Espionage Act,

38:20.863 --> 38:22.474
but we're gonna talk
to the U.S. Attorney

38:22.561 --> 38:24.432
let him know
the situation you were in.

38:24.519 --> 38:25.868
I appreciate that.
I do.

38:25.955 --> 38:27.653
But I'm good.

38:35.574 --> 38:37.271
I did what I had to do.

38:37.358 --> 38:39.621
They were gonna kill my son.

38:39.708 --> 38:42.842
And at the end of the day,
he's safe.

38:42.929 --> 38:44.670
That's enough.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.079
Hey, what's that about?

39:03.166 --> 39:05.386
I don't know.

39:14.003 --> 39:15.614
Are you good?

39:15.701 --> 39:18.356
Yeah, I'm good.

39:18.443 --> 39:22.098
This is gonna be my last case
with you guys for a while.

39:22.185 --> 39:23.535
What are you talking about?

39:23.622 --> 39:26.102
We were just getting started.

39:26.189 --> 39:27.800
Yeah, I know.

39:27.887 --> 39:32.326
I just--I need to take
some time and clear my head.

39:35.198 --> 39:37.984
But I'm just gonna go down
to white collar, you know?

39:38.071 --> 39:40.160
I'm gonna take on all
the dangerous dudes

39:40.247 --> 39:43.772
on Wall Street there who are
doing insider trading, so...

39:43.859 --> 39:45.557
OK.

39:45.644 --> 39:47.646
I'll be honest, though.

39:47.733 --> 39:49.169
I don't think
I'm completely OK with this,

39:49.256 --> 39:50.431
but if it's for the best--

39:50.518 --> 39:52.215
I'll be two floors down.

39:52.302 --> 39:54.174
Don't get emotional.

39:55.218 --> 39:57.525
Bye-bye.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.007
Can I walk you out?

40:01.094 --> 40:02.356
Of course.

40:07.709 --> 40:10.146
So will you talk to me, Nina?

40:10.233 --> 40:11.974
What's going on?

40:12.061 --> 40:13.715
Why are you really leaving?

40:17.023 --> 40:19.112
I just need some time,
like I said, you know,

40:19.199 --> 40:22.028
to figure things out,

40:22.115 --> 40:26.336
what I'm gonna do
with my life and you.

40:29.601 --> 40:33.735
So what about the baby?

40:36.346 --> 40:38.827
I don't know.

40:38.914 --> 40:41.177
Like I said,
I just need some time.

41:02.329 --> 41:04.462
I'll call you, OK?

41:06.855 --> 41:09.162
Yeah.

41:17.083 --> 41:19.433
Bye.
