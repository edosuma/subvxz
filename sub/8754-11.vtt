00:10.660 --> 00:14.695
I hear, "Mad house."
That's creepy.

00:14.797 --> 00:16.397
It's terrifying.

00:16.499 --> 00:17.999
I wouldn't come down here alone.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.467
It feels like I'm being punched.

00:19.569 --> 00:21.168
Two red marks on my arm.

00:21.271 --> 00:23.271
He got shot?

00:23.373 --> 00:25.740
It does not have a happy ending.

00:25.842 --> 00:29.543
The energy is anxious, angry.

00:29.646 --> 00:33.347
This is seriously the worst place to be.

00:33.449 --> 00:35.916
Something bad's going to happen.

00:36.019 --> 00:38.653
My name is Amy Allan.

00:38.755 --> 00:39.820
There's panic.

00:39.922 --> 00:40.888
And it's almost like a butchering.

00:40.990 --> 00:42.423
I see dead people.

00:42.525 --> 00:44.692
They all died horribly.

00:44.794 --> 00:46.193
I speak to dead people.

00:46.329 --> 00:47.495
Get out of here.

00:47.597 --> 00:48.963
And they speak to me.

00:49.065 --> 00:50.765
Vicious.

00:50.867 --> 00:53.868
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:53.970 --> 00:55.703
It doesn't matter where
you are. I'll find you.

00:55.805 --> 00:57.138
I rely on my partner.

00:57.240 --> 00:58.406
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

00:58.508 --> 01:01.008
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:01.110 --> 01:02.510
This guy's a real piece of work.

01:02.612 --> 01:05.780
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:05.882 --> 01:07.081
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

01:07.183 --> 01:09.050
It's my job to reveal them.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.584
This is not good.

01:10.687 --> 01:12.353
But Steve and I never speak...

01:12.455 --> 01:14.455
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:14.557 --> 01:16.424
until the very end...

01:16.526 --> 01:17.792
I want my life back.

01:17.894 --> 01:19.860
when we uncover if
it's safe for you to stay...

01:19.946 --> 01:21.429
Is he trying to kill her?

01:21.531 --> 01:22.697
or time to get out.

01:22.799 --> 01:24.231
Oh, my God.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.067
This is going to kill us.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074

01:39.832 --> 01:41.115
I'm out here in Marshall, Missouri.

01:41.217 --> 01:44.185
It's about 90 miles east of Kansas City.

01:44.270 --> 01:45.419
I got a call from a woman

01:45.521 --> 01:48.923
who saved the small
city's only movie theater.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.441
Now, here's the problem.

01:50.560 --> 01:52.293
She believes something
there is not happy about it

01:52.378 --> 01:54.595
and wants her out.

01:54.697 --> 01:57.131
She's so scared for her staff and family,

01:57.216 --> 01:59.050
she's agreed to close
the theater for a few days

01:59.168 --> 02:00.534
during our investigation.

02:00.636 --> 02:01.802
She said if we can't help her,

02:01.904 --> 02:03.971
she might have to walk
away and shut the doors.

02:08.144 --> 02:10.794
Before Amy arrives, it's important

02:10.880 --> 02:15.282
that I clear the area of
any leading information.

02:15.385 --> 02:17.868
I can't hide that this is a movie theater,

02:17.954 --> 02:19.053
but I still need to cover anything

02:19.122 --> 02:22.223
that might distract her during her walk.

02:22.325 --> 02:26.160
When I'm finished, the location
will be ready for tonight.

02:35.872 --> 02:39.356
There's a lot of dead
people that come around.

02:39.442 --> 02:42.927
And I feel like they're sick or crazy.

02:45.047 --> 02:46.914
And I hear, "Mad house."

02:49.352 --> 02:51.419
[Bleep] me.

02:51.521 --> 02:52.720
Ugh.

02:52.822 --> 02:57.258
There's a lot of competition
here between the dead,

02:57.360 --> 02:59.960
competing for attention.

03:05.067 --> 03:06.400
And... and, like,
for some reason,

03:06.502 --> 03:08.869
they don't like each other.

03:08.971 --> 03:12.490
I'm hearing, "This is
where the dead throw down."

03:19.832 --> 03:21.248
Well, Kim, this is a really

03:21.334 --> 03:22.883
quaint-looking place you've got here.

03:22.985 --> 03:24.885
But when you were on the
phone with me, it just...

03:24.987 --> 03:26.420
you sounded really desperate.

03:26.522 --> 03:27.655
What's going on?

03:27.790 --> 03:30.524
We purchased the theater four years ago.

03:30.626 --> 03:31.792
- Okay.
- There was an ad in the paper

03:31.894 --> 03:35.129
that said it was going
to be, uh, shut down.

03:35.214 --> 03:37.398
Marshall is a small town.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.434
And, like many towns, it
it has been struggling.

03:40.536 --> 03:41.969
A lot of stuff is closed down here.

03:42.071 --> 03:44.738
Yes.

03:44.841 --> 03:47.942
It would be a very big blow to Marshall

03:48.044 --> 03:49.343
to not have a movie theater.

03:49.428 --> 03:51.412
It would be like turning
off that last light.

03:51.514 --> 03:53.247
But why do you got to
be the responsible one?

03:53.332 --> 03:54.532
I grew up in Marshall.

03:54.617 --> 03:56.584
I came to this movie theater as a child.

03:56.669 --> 03:58.085
I raised my kids here.

03:58.187 --> 03:59.153
So, you want to preserve that?

03:59.255 --> 04:00.454
Yes.

04:00.540 --> 04:05.109
This is the theater when it was really old.

04:05.228 --> 04:06.610
Doesn't even have the marquee out front,

04:06.729 --> 04:07.828
right? Nope.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.130
So what exactly is everybody experiencing?

04:10.233 --> 04:13.133
Noises that just can't be explained.

04:13.269 --> 04:18.305
Laughter, voice mimicry,
things being moved.

04:18.406 --> 04:20.608
Several people have been touched.

04:20.709 --> 04:23.677
A couple people have
actually seen shadow figures.

04:23.779 --> 04:24.778
Okay.

04:24.881 --> 04:26.146
How many people do you have on staff?

04:26.249 --> 04:27.248
Um, 15.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.984
And a lot of those are my family.

04:30.069 --> 04:33.454
Uh, actually, I have a picture.

04:33.556 --> 04:35.589
My son, Damon, he's 22.

04:35.675 --> 04:37.491
My daughter, Allie, is 23.

04:37.593 --> 04:41.061
And my dad, he just turned 64.

04:41.163 --> 04:44.381
- I'm worried about my dad.
- Why?

04:44.500 --> 04:47.918
I feel like it's really
narrowing in on him.

04:48.004 --> 04:52.306
It's definitely created a
lot of anxiety and tension.

04:52.441 --> 04:54.475
I'm afraid for what's next.

04:54.610 --> 04:58.262
I want my staff and my family
to feel that they're safe.

04:58.347 --> 05:00.915
And I want people to know
that the theater will...

05:01.000 --> 05:03.183
will always be here.

05:06.222 --> 05:09.857
That's creepy [bleep].

05:09.959 --> 05:12.359
There's a lot of people here.

05:12.495 --> 05:13.944
Any idea how many?

05:14.030 --> 05:18.732
I feel like I met the whole town.

05:18.818 --> 05:22.636
A lot of the dead people
here go in your body.

05:22.772 --> 05:26.173
If they're jumped by those people,

05:26.275 --> 05:28.275
they might change.

05:28.377 --> 05:29.476
How?

05:29.562 --> 05:31.812
I think people could get really depressed,

05:31.948 --> 05:34.348
suddenly violently ill.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.954
Oh, my God.

05:43.075 --> 05:44.441
What?

05:44.527 --> 05:46.694
I just don't think it's
gonna be good down there,

05:46.796 --> 05:48.796
'cause, like, all the [bleep] people.

06:00.776 --> 06:02.209
Okay. So why'd you bring me down here?

06:02.311 --> 06:05.429
I feel just a sense of unease, anxiety,

06:05.514 --> 06:07.381
like I'm being watched.

06:07.516 --> 06:09.850
Nobody wants to come
down here, to be honest.

06:09.952 --> 06:10.834
So, it's that bad down here?

06:10.953 --> 06:11.952
Yes.

06:12.088 --> 06:13.537
Anything else happening to you down here?

06:13.623 --> 06:15.055
I hear a lot of noises.

06:15.157 --> 06:18.926
It sounds like somebody's,
like, banging around on things.

06:19.028 --> 06:20.828
I mean, you've got pipes.
You've got wood walls.

06:20.963 --> 06:22.730
You've got concrete floors. I mean...

06:22.815 --> 06:25.265
It's not the kind of
clanking that you would hear

06:25.368 --> 06:27.568
with a furnace shutting off or on.

06:27.653 --> 06:30.471
It's almost like it
wants to get my attention.

06:30.606 --> 06:31.438
Now, you're sure these noises

06:31.524 --> 06:32.523
aren't coming from a staff member?

06:32.642 --> 06:34.174
Whenever I've heard these noises,

06:34.276 --> 06:35.876
I knew I was alone in the building.

06:36.012 --> 06:37.661
Wow. What do you think is here?

06:37.780 --> 06:41.815
That's what I'm really hoping
to find out, um, with your help.

06:47.490 --> 06:52.026
I don't think the living would
have good experiences down here.

06:52.128 --> 06:54.194
There's a lot of death here.

06:54.296 --> 06:56.096
I feel a lot of hustle and bustle.

06:56.198 --> 06:59.566
A lot of bad people,
in and out, in and out.

07:03.439 --> 07:05.406
I feel like my head gets beat.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.975
I feel, like, impacts to my head.

07:12.782 --> 07:15.366
The people here...

07:15.484 --> 07:17.985
I don't know why they're here.

07:18.087 --> 07:21.288
They're yelling and screaming.

07:21.390 --> 07:23.190
They're sick... sick.

07:23.292 --> 07:25.993
So much oppression.

07:26.095 --> 07:27.761
Oppression.

07:35.838 --> 07:37.104
So, Amber, I was talking to Kimmy.

07:37.206 --> 07:39.423
She told me you're one of
the oldest employees here.

07:39.542 --> 07:40.407
Yes, that's correct.

07:40.509 --> 07:42.076
How long you been working here?

07:42.178 --> 07:43.844
- Um, 18 years.
- Okay.

07:43.929 --> 07:46.613
Have you had experiences
along those 18 years?

07:46.749 --> 07:48.198
Yes, I've had several.

07:48.317 --> 07:52.519
The most recent one is, I was pinched.

07:52.621 --> 07:55.923
I was downstairs in the concession stand,

07:56.025 --> 07:58.058
and I felt a pinch on my arm.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.893
And I looked down,

07:59.995 --> 08:02.696
and I had two red marks on my arm.

08:02.798 --> 08:04.631
Did you feel like it
was fingers or something?

08:04.767 --> 08:07.251
It felt like a person pinching, yes.

08:07.336 --> 08:09.319
Wow. Anything else go on?

08:09.438 --> 08:12.756
We were starting up a movie up here,

08:12.875 --> 08:17.544
and on the screen there was,
like, the silhouette of a man.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.949
I could tell that he was tall and thin

08:22.051 --> 08:24.251
- and he had, like, broad shoulders.
- Okay.

08:24.336 --> 08:25.419
Could it have been
somebody behind the curtain?

08:25.554 --> 08:26.670
No.

08:26.756 --> 08:29.356
I don't even think you
can get behind this screen.

08:29.458 --> 08:31.258
Um, the only way

08:31.343 --> 08:33.659
would be to stand in front of the window...

08:33.763 --> 08:36.712
- Okay.
- ... Up there.

08:36.832 --> 08:37.831
So, was anybody in the room with you?

08:37.967 --> 08:40.234
No. I was there by myself.

08:40.302 --> 08:42.936
Was there something
wrong with the film? No.

08:43.038 --> 08:44.705
We played a later showing of it

08:44.840 --> 08:47.207
and, when I turned it
on for the next showing,

08:47.293 --> 08:48.509
it was fine.

08:48.594 --> 08:51.411
Wow. Okay.

08:57.253 --> 09:03.157
This is, seriously, the worst place to be.

09:03.259 --> 09:06.627
Living people up here
would see a lot of [bleep].

09:06.729 --> 09:10.731
Um...

09:10.833 --> 09:12.132
Uh...

09:16.205 --> 09:18.338
Shadow people.

09:18.440 --> 09:20.541
You can see them in the seats...

09:24.980 --> 09:26.430
swooping all over the place.

09:26.549 --> 09:29.917
It's, like, chaotic up here.

09:30.019 --> 09:32.853
The energy is, uh, bad.

09:32.955 --> 09:35.455
Anxious. Angry.

09:35.541 --> 09:37.457
I feel very sick.

10:05.269 --> 10:07.302
So, Paul, I was talking
to your daughter Kimberly.

10:07.404 --> 10:09.404
And, um, she's really worried about you.

10:09.506 --> 10:12.307
She thinks that whatever's
here is actually targeting you,

10:12.443 --> 10:14.276
picking on you.

10:14.378 --> 10:15.944
Do you agree with that?

10:16.046 --> 10:18.030
- I'm beginning to.
- You are?

10:18.115 --> 10:21.183
It's... the activity is
getting a little more personal.

10:21.268 --> 10:24.169
I feel like I'm sharing this building

10:24.288 --> 10:26.989
with a being that's not human.

10:27.091 --> 10:29.224
I'm not sure that I'm the
one that brought this here

10:29.310 --> 10:32.561
or there's just something
about me that makes me

10:32.646 --> 10:35.063
- vulnerable to these things.
- Why?

10:35.199 --> 10:39.201
Have you ever had experiences
before the theater here?

10:39.286 --> 10:41.737
- Yes.
- You have?

10:41.822 --> 10:42.788
Where was that?

10:42.907 --> 10:46.241
This was at a house in Kansas City.

10:46.377 --> 10:49.678
From the time I was 16 until I was 23,

10:49.780 --> 10:51.346
the house was very active.

10:51.448 --> 10:55.884
What scares me the most is
that they may have returned.

10:55.970 --> 10:58.353
I may have brought them from Kansas City

10:58.455 --> 11:01.056
and they're just showing up now.

11:01.141 --> 11:05.861
But I'm afraid that my
daughter or her staff

11:05.963 --> 11:09.881
may end up experiencing some
of the things that I have.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.467
And I can't...

11:12.603 --> 11:15.103
that's something I
couldn't even apologize for.

11:15.239 --> 11:18.173
So tell me about a few
things that happened to you.

11:18.275 --> 11:23.278
I heard a girl, a young girl, laughing.

11:23.414 --> 11:25.314
I looked up and down and around.

11:25.416 --> 11:28.317
I thought, if I can find the source

11:28.402 --> 11:30.786
or the direction it's coming from,

11:30.888 --> 11:32.321
then I can investigate that area.

11:32.406 --> 11:34.289
But it didn't work.

11:34.391 --> 11:35.390
Was anybody here?

11:35.492 --> 11:36.825
I was the only one here.

11:36.927 --> 11:37.943
Anything else?

11:38.062 --> 11:42.097
I was toward the back of the theater, uh,

11:42.182 --> 11:45.567
and heard an extremely loud boom.

11:45.669 --> 11:49.671
I describe it as somebody
dropping a bowling ball

11:49.807 --> 11:52.107
on a wood floor from 25 or 30 feet.

11:52.209 --> 11:53.208
- That loud?
- Yeah.

11:53.294 --> 11:54.710
I didn't know what to think.

11:54.845 --> 11:56.945
Now, is it possible that
it was a loop from a movie

11:57.031 --> 11:57.813
that was playing here?

11:57.915 --> 11:59.881
No movies were showing.

11:59.984 --> 12:03.518
Projectors were shut down
and I was the only one here.

12:06.123 --> 12:09.391
There's, like, this woman who is there.

12:09.476 --> 12:10.659
She's all dressed in black.

12:10.744 --> 12:13.028
This woman is dressed in black.

12:13.130 --> 12:15.364
I've never experienced anything like this.

12:15.466 --> 12:17.899
Every time I turn around,
I see another dead person.

12:18.002 --> 12:21.370
And just about all of them are angry.

12:21.472 --> 12:24.439
She is, like, in... in here.

12:24.575 --> 12:26.541
She really, um,

12:26.677 --> 12:33.048
doesn't care for, um,
many of the people here.

12:33.150 --> 12:35.517
They bother her often.

12:35.619 --> 12:39.888
Then she gets angry
and she does throw fits.

12:39.990 --> 12:44.960
When she throws fits, she throws things.

12:45.062 --> 12:46.345
I'm hearing a lot of noise,

12:46.430 --> 12:50.532
like if she is, like, throwing metal.

12:50.634 --> 12:53.618
Like, pots and pans banging and stuff.

12:53.704 --> 12:55.437
You know what I mean?

12:55.539 --> 12:58.657
She's got a lot of issues.

12:58.776 --> 12:59.841
You said things are getting more personal.

12:59.943 --> 13:01.443
What do you mean by that?

13:01.545 --> 13:05.247
About a year after I started working here,

13:05.349 --> 13:09.401
I was doing some work behind
the screen in the hallway.

13:09.520 --> 13:12.721
And I felt a fairly firm grip

13:12.823 --> 13:14.423
on my left shoulder.

13:14.525 --> 13:16.224
Now, Paul, I really want to
see where you got grabbed.

13:16.310 --> 13:17.759
- Can you show me?
- Yes.

13:17.895 --> 13:19.661
Okay.

13:20.848 --> 13:22.397
I was installing this plywood

13:22.533 --> 13:26.034
on the back of that
framework of that structure.

13:26.120 --> 13:27.502
Okay. So, you were facing this way?

13:27.604 --> 13:28.770
Facing toward the screen.

13:28.872 --> 13:30.672
And right after that,

13:30.774 --> 13:34.242
I felt a firm grip on my left shoulder,

13:34.344 --> 13:35.827
but I immediately turned around.

13:35.913 --> 13:39.748
I knew no one could fit behind me.

13:39.833 --> 13:40.916
Now, there's a lot of stuff back here.

13:41.001 --> 13:42.884
Are you sure something didn't fall on you?

13:42.970 --> 13:45.053
It wasn't something that fell and bounced.

13:45.189 --> 13:48.557
It was a firm grip that,
as soon as I turned around,

13:48.642 --> 13:50.125
they released it.

13:50.210 --> 13:51.376
Well, Paul, I can see why your daughter

13:51.495 --> 13:52.961
is so worried about you.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.967
It feels like I'm being punched.

14:08.045 --> 14:09.377
A male.

14:09.513 --> 14:13.381
He's dead, and he doesn't
feel good being dead.

14:13.484 --> 14:15.016
He feels terrible.

14:15.119 --> 14:17.719
Does he have any kind of
interaction with the living?

14:17.821 --> 14:20.355
He goes in their body.

14:20.457 --> 14:22.657
That's how he communicates.

14:22.743 --> 14:26.661
I think that people would
feel very drained by him.

14:26.763 --> 14:29.564
They would feel almost frozen physically,

14:29.666 --> 14:31.900
like, they couldn't move or walk.

14:32.002 --> 14:34.102
They wouldn't be able to breathe well.

14:34.204 --> 14:35.670
I think that they might even

14:35.772 --> 14:38.106
feel like they're having a heart attack.

14:55.961 --> 14:57.477
Now, this doesn't happen very often,

14:57.579 --> 15:00.247
but the very first call I made paid off.

15:00.332 --> 15:01.781
I reached out to the local county sheriff,

15:01.884 --> 15:03.900
and he tells me one of
the very first managers

15:04.019 --> 15:07.120
of Kimberly's theater was
involved in a bizarre homicide.

15:07.222 --> 15:09.723
He says the story
involved betrayal, revenge,

15:09.808 --> 15:11.691
and was finally settled with a bullet.

15:16.465 --> 15:17.364
You mentioned on the phone

15:17.466 --> 15:19.165
that there was this love triangle

15:19.268 --> 15:20.984
that ended up in a homicide

15:21.069 --> 15:23.103
directly associated with the
theater I'm investigating.

15:23.205 --> 15:26.056
Yes, sir. Back in 1932,

15:26.174 --> 15:29.759
a gentleman by the name of Frank Celoud

15:29.845 --> 15:31.845
was offered a promotion

15:31.930 --> 15:36.049
to manage what was called
back then the Fox Theater.

15:36.134 --> 15:39.553
- Okay.
- So he moved his wife...

15:39.655 --> 15:42.022
that's Gladys Celoud...

15:42.124 --> 15:44.257
and his infant daughter to Marshall.

15:44.343 --> 15:45.926
So, what happened? What went wrong?

15:46.028 --> 15:49.262
A few months after the Celouds took over,

15:49.364 --> 15:50.530
Frank Celoud got wind

15:50.632 --> 15:53.199
that his wife was having an affair

15:53.335 --> 15:56.703
- with a gentleman by the name of Estel Turner.
- Okay.

15:56.805 --> 15:59.906
And this would be Mr. Estel Turner.

15:59.992 --> 16:03.577
Estel Turner was a young man, 21 years old,

16:03.679 --> 16:05.545
worked over here at the local shoe factory

16:05.647 --> 16:06.913
back in those days.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.481
This guy looks kind of smug, too.

16:08.567 --> 16:09.733
He does.

16:09.818 --> 16:14.521
Frank finds out and then
he approaches Estel Turner.

16:14.656 --> 16:18.658
Frank Celoud offers
him this sort of a deal.

16:18.794 --> 16:20.927
He said, "Well, if you're
not gonna leave her alone,"

16:21.013 --> 16:22.862
he said, "I'll just back out of the picture"

16:22.965 --> 16:27.317
and give Gladys to you on one condition.

16:27.402 --> 16:29.402
"And that condition is you're
gonna have to marry her."

16:29.488 --> 16:31.371
Estel thinks about it a couple minutes

16:31.473 --> 16:34.007
and says, "You know, I'm not gonna do that."

16:34.092 --> 16:35.208
I'm not gonna carry the weight

16:35.344 --> 16:39.512
of breaking up your family.

16:39.648 --> 16:40.664
"I'll just leave her alone."

16:40.782 --> 16:41.831
So, Sheriff, I know

16:41.950 --> 16:43.783
this doesn't have a
happy ending, this story.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.585
- It does not have a happy ending.
- Okay.

16:45.654 --> 16:46.653
So, what happens next?

16:46.788 --> 16:49.189
About maybe a month later,

16:49.324 --> 16:53.259
Frank Celoud takes his
wife, Gladys, to a dance

16:53.362 --> 16:54.928
- over at the old Elk's Lodge...
- Okay.

16:55.063 --> 16:57.230
which at that time
was right across the street

16:57.316 --> 16:59.566
from the theater that he was managing.

16:59.668 --> 17:02.335
- Estel Turner shows up.
- Okay.

17:02.421 --> 17:04.503
And sometime during the dance,

17:04.589 --> 17:08.241
Estel Turner comes over
and approaches Gladys,

17:08.327 --> 17:10.777
and asks her for a dance
and starts talking to her.

17:10.912 --> 17:13.713
- Got a lot of balls on this guy, right?
- Yes.

17:13.815 --> 17:16.700
Frank Celoud approached Estel Turner

17:16.818 --> 17:18.451
and yells, you know,

17:18.537 --> 17:20.904
"If you don't leave my wife
alone, I'm gonna kill you."

17:21.022 --> 17:22.321
I would have killed
this guy a long time ago.

17:22.406 --> 17:23.690
You and I both.

17:23.791 --> 17:25.141
What happens?

17:25.227 --> 17:27.560
Frank leaves the theater, alone.

17:27.695 --> 17:29.929
Estel approaches Frank Celoud

17:30.032 --> 17:32.666
and they get into another argument.

17:32.768 --> 17:36.353
Frank Celoud gets angry
enough that he pulls

17:36.438 --> 17:39.522
a.380 semi-automatic
pistol from his pocket

17:39.608 --> 17:42.108
and fires a round into
Estel Turner's chest.

17:42.194 --> 17:44.444
So, he winds up shooting this guy

17:44.546 --> 17:45.929
right in front of the theater?

17:46.048 --> 17:47.280
Exactly right.

17:47.366 --> 17:50.517
About 10 minutes later, Estel Turner dies.

17:50.652 --> 17:53.053
And I have a copy of the death certificate.

17:55.057 --> 17:56.389
"Gunshot wound

17:56.525 --> 17:58.858
- in the hands of Frank J. Celoud."
- Yes.

17:58.944 --> 18:00.593
Do the cops collar him that night?

18:00.696 --> 18:03.029
- They arrest him that night?
- They arrest him that night.

18:03.131 --> 18:08.068
He is charged with first-degree murder.

18:08.153 --> 18:11.204
He actually is arraigned in
this courtroom the next day.

18:11.306 --> 18:12.372
- Right here?
- Right here.

18:12.457 --> 18:14.541
This is pretty much where he stood.

18:14.643 --> 18:16.826
After the jury deliberates
about seven hours,

18:16.945 --> 18:19.479
they come back and they
find him not guilty.

18:19.564 --> 18:20.680
You're kidding.

18:20.816 --> 18:24.184
I actually have a news
article here, big headlines.

18:24.319 --> 18:27.353
That was a big deal back in 1933.

18:27.456 --> 18:28.221
What was his defense?

18:28.323 --> 18:29.355
Back in those days,

18:29.491 --> 18:32.542
there was just kind of this unwritten law

18:32.661 --> 18:34.244
to where if something

18:34.329 --> 18:36.763
or somebody threatens your family,

18:36.848 --> 18:39.065
you have a right to defend your family.

18:41.503 --> 18:46.439
This guy who jumps people,
someone hated him a lot.

18:46.541 --> 18:48.341
They hated him.

18:48.443 --> 18:50.643
Hated him.

18:50.746 --> 18:54.380
And he finally [bleep] got him.

18:54.466 --> 19:01.488
The pain I'm feeling...
is in my upper chest,

19:01.590 --> 19:04.340
but it goes out my back.

19:04.459 --> 19:06.793
I want to say he got shot.

19:06.895 --> 19:12.432
Then I'm hearing a woman
screaming and falling down.

19:15.036 --> 19:18.371
I don't think he was expecting this,

19:18.473 --> 19:24.277
and I think he's really shocked.

19:24.379 --> 19:33.186
And he can't move on from this,
'cause it's like a pride thing.

19:35.209 --> 19:36.442
So far, I've got a theater

19:36.544 --> 19:38.460
being terrorized by unexplained activity

19:38.579 --> 19:42.281
and a murder that took place
right outside its front door.

19:42.383 --> 19:45.985
But I still need to see
if there's anything else.

19:46.087 --> 19:48.687
Searching through old records,
I find another deadly shooting

19:48.789 --> 19:50.723
involving a guy named James Ming.

19:50.825 --> 19:52.091
Turns out he managed a hotel

19:52.193 --> 19:53.842
that used to operate
right across the street

19:53.961 --> 19:56.028
from my client's property.

19:56.163 --> 19:57.980
So I called on the Marshall police chief

19:58.065 --> 20:00.299
who says he's gonna look
into this case for me.

20:04.238 --> 20:05.070
So, Mike, thanks for meeting me

20:05.172 --> 20:06.638
and helping me out with my case.

20:06.741 --> 20:08.040
Now, you know the
theater I'm talking about?

20:08.175 --> 20:09.141
Yes, I do.

20:09.243 --> 20:10.959
I worked there for six years.

20:11.078 --> 20:12.411
- You worked there?
- Yes.

20:12.513 --> 20:14.213
Anything strange happen to
you that you couldn't explain?

20:14.315 --> 20:17.232
It was always kind of
eerie, especially, like,

20:17.351 --> 20:18.951
if you were the last
person there closing up.

20:19.053 --> 20:21.020
You didn't want to be there alone too much.

20:21.105 --> 20:22.337
Okay. So, Mike,

20:22.423 --> 20:25.257
the articles I had seen looked
like Ming killed somebody

20:25.359 --> 20:26.825
that worked for him. Is that right?

20:26.961 --> 20:29.378
What I found out was,
Ming took over management

20:29.497 --> 20:31.296
of Ming House Hotel in 1872.

20:31.382 --> 20:32.431
Okay.

20:32.516 --> 20:35.067
It was about 100 feet from the theater,

20:35.169 --> 20:37.069
but it's not in existence anymore.

20:37.171 --> 20:38.721
Now, is Ming a Chinese guy or a white guy?

20:38.839 --> 20:40.622
He's a white guy, late 50s.

20:40.708 --> 20:43.742
On December 22nd of 1898,

20:43.844 --> 20:46.779
Ming asked for his porter, Emmett Craddock,

20:46.881 --> 20:48.013
to come to his room.

20:48.099 --> 20:50.582
Craddock is a 27-year-old black male.

20:50.684 --> 20:51.817
Okay.

20:51.919 --> 20:53.719
And he's working for
him, but he's not there.

20:53.821 --> 20:55.454
He's out running an errand for the hotel.

20:55.539 --> 20:58.407
Well by the time he gets
back, Ming's outraged.

20:58.526 --> 20:59.858
He's screaming racial slurs at him,

20:59.994 --> 21:01.376
telling him to leave the hotel.

21:01.462 --> 21:03.195
- So, he's firing him, basically?
- Yes.

21:03.297 --> 21:05.831
Craddock says, "If you'll
give me my day's wage",

21:05.916 --> 21:07.132
I'll leave.

21:07.218 --> 21:09.201
"But I'm not leaving until I get paid."

21:09.286 --> 21:10.569
It gets heated.

21:10.671 --> 21:13.088
And Ming's upset that he has a porter

21:13.207 --> 21:15.474
that's talking to him and
addressing him in a way

21:15.559 --> 21:18.177
that he shouldn't be, since
he's the manager of this hotel.

21:18.312 --> 21:19.678
- Okay.
- But it escalated.

21:19.814 --> 21:22.147
And at that point in time,
Ming shot him in the head

21:22.233 --> 21:25.534
with a.32 caliber Smith & Wesson revolver.

21:25.653 --> 21:28.854
Ming, who was high on
opiates at that point in time,

21:28.939 --> 21:30.906
- was beyond reasoning with.
- Okay.

21:31.025 --> 21:33.792
So, Mike, I'm assuming he
got charged for this crime?

21:33.878 --> 21:35.094
He was charged with the crime,

21:35.179 --> 21:37.179
but he was deemed legally insane,

21:37.298 --> 21:40.466
so he was never tried for the crime.

21:40.551 --> 21:43.068
They sent him to an
asylum in Nevada, Missouri,

21:43.154 --> 21:45.621
- about 150 miles from here.
- Okay.

21:45.706 --> 21:48.090
So, now, does he spend the
rest of his life in this place?

21:48.209 --> 21:50.175
Actually, no. After about three months

21:50.261 --> 21:54.279
of being in the asylum, he
escapes, about May of 1900.

21:54.365 --> 21:55.497
When they caught him,

21:55.616 --> 21:57.332
they wanted him to pack
up and come back with them.

21:57.451 --> 21:58.817
So when he went back to the room,

21:58.919 --> 22:01.420
he pulled out a large revolver
and shot himself in the head.

22:11.232 --> 22:13.031
There's some male,

22:13.134 --> 22:16.869
and he's telling me to
[bleep] off and get out of here

22:16.971 --> 22:17.903
and leave him alone.

22:18.005 --> 22:19.471
And he just wants to be alone.

22:19.573 --> 22:22.708
He doesn't want anybody here.

22:24.645 --> 22:29.114
I want to say he's between,
like, 1870 and 1910.

22:29.216 --> 22:32.701
He was a drinker, a big drinker.

22:32.820 --> 22:34.786
He's just wasted, you know?

22:34.922 --> 22:37.523
He's drunk.

22:37.658 --> 22:42.094
He's, like, stumbling
around and [bleep] you know?

22:42.196 --> 22:45.130
Oh, he's horrible and
everybody [bleep] hates him.

22:45.216 --> 22:46.498
And all this kind of [bleep].

22:46.634 --> 22:50.435
You get all the blame,
and he's the one to blame.

22:50.538 --> 22:53.605
Oh, he's just tired of it.

22:53.707 --> 22:55.657
He feels very guilty.

22:55.776 --> 22:58.110
He's just showing me, like, dead bodies.

22:58.212 --> 22:59.845
He's like, "Look at the mess I made!"

22:59.947 --> 23:01.880
Look at the mess I made!"

23:15.092 --> 23:17.559
Another thing caught my
eye during the research,

23:17.695 --> 23:19.945
the unsolved murder of a woman.

23:20.064 --> 23:21.430
The last place she's seen alive

23:21.515 --> 23:25.434
is right next to the
theater I'm investigating.

23:25.536 --> 23:26.602
I've called on a local author

23:26.670 --> 23:27.803
who's written about the homicide.

23:27.905 --> 23:28.837
He says he's got information

23:28.939 --> 23:30.723
that will definitely help my case.

23:36.047 --> 23:38.714
Now, Jason, what do you
know about this case?

23:38.816 --> 23:40.616
The woman's name was Nellie Price.

23:40.718 --> 23:42.718
She was 42 years old,

23:42.820 --> 23:45.671
and she worked for a
shoe manufacturer in town.

23:45.790 --> 23:48.357
Her father was sick, so
she cared for her father.

23:48.459 --> 23:49.958
Okay. So,

23:50.061 --> 23:51.960
what are the circumstances
of her disappearance?

23:52.046 --> 23:53.345
Does anybody know what happened?

23:53.464 --> 23:55.664
On April 10, 1937,

23:55.766 --> 23:58.300
she left work and was
walking to a local nightclub

23:58.385 --> 24:00.636
to meet a date, a man named Joe Smiley.

24:00.738 --> 24:02.888
She was walking in front a car dealership.

24:02.973 --> 24:03.806
She was on the sidewalk.

24:03.941 --> 24:05.140
That was the last time she was seen,

24:05.276 --> 24:08.193
and it was right next to the
property you're investigating.

24:08.312 --> 24:09.678
She was never seen again after that?

24:09.780 --> 24:11.947
No, she just vanished.

24:12.049 --> 24:13.982
She had been missing for 17 days.

24:14.085 --> 24:18.153
And this was a really small town in 1937.

24:18.239 --> 24:20.539
People just didn't go missing like that.

24:20.624 --> 24:21.790
The town was panicking.

24:21.876 --> 24:23.158
They really wanted to find her.

24:23.260 --> 24:25.027
The entire town searched.

24:25.112 --> 24:27.196
The county... all the county
officials, city officials,

24:27.331 --> 24:28.247
were looking for her.

24:28.365 --> 24:30.466
Here's the article on it.

24:30.551 --> 24:33.185
They found her on a sand bank.

24:33.304 --> 24:36.205
Her arms and legs were
bound with copper wire,

24:36.307 --> 24:39.341
and she'd been weighed down
with, uh, with window weights

24:39.443 --> 24:40.793
- and a steel rod.
- Okay.

24:40.878 --> 24:42.544
So, what was the official cause of death?

24:42.646 --> 24:44.346
This is the certificate of death.

24:44.431 --> 24:47.833
It says right here
strangulation and murder.

24:47.918 --> 24:49.518
Okay. What about this Joe Smiley?

24:49.620 --> 24:51.203
- Cops talk to him?
- Well, yeah.

24:51.288 --> 24:52.354
He was the only suspect that they had.

24:52.456 --> 24:54.273
And then they dismissed him really early,

24:54.391 --> 24:56.592
because he had an alibi.

24:56.694 --> 24:57.759
So, did the investigators

24:57.862 --> 24:59.895
ever come up with any workable leads?

24:59.997 --> 25:00.696
Sadly, no.

25:00.798 --> 25:01.864
I mean, 77 years later,

25:01.966 --> 25:03.265
we still don't know who killed her.

25:03.367 --> 25:06.735
That's a shame.

25:06.837 --> 25:10.906
The lady in black,
she's, like, crying out.

25:11.008 --> 25:14.209
Oh, she's a mess. She's
crying, crying, crying.

25:14.295 --> 25:16.995
The lady in black who throws
things is having a breakdown.

25:17.081 --> 25:20.215
She's frantically telling
me what happened to her.

25:20.317 --> 25:22.751
She's talking about a male named Joe.

25:22.853 --> 25:26.622
I don't know their
relationship, but this is weird.

25:26.707 --> 25:31.026
I think she was in love
with him, or loved him.

25:31.111 --> 25:33.896
She's, like, saying,
"It's very complicated."

25:33.998 --> 25:36.565
There's a lot... a lot of emotion here.

25:36.667 --> 25:39.568
I think he's dead.

25:39.670 --> 25:41.036
She feels like she's an old woman,

25:41.138 --> 25:44.022
but I don't think that she really is.

25:44.141 --> 25:48.677
She's saying that old is, like, 40.

25:48.779 --> 25:51.146
She went missing.

25:51.248 --> 25:52.414
Something happened.

25:52.499 --> 25:54.650
Like, I don't know. She
was married or engaged.

25:54.752 --> 25:57.653
Something with this
engagement or something.

25:57.755 --> 25:59.121
She was running. She was outside.

25:59.223 --> 26:00.856
It was cold.

26:00.958 --> 26:03.225
And she's wet.

26:03.327 --> 26:07.095
She feels trapped.

26:07.198 --> 26:08.864
Oh, the neck. Ow.

26:08.966 --> 26:10.365
It hurts a lot.

26:13.504 --> 26:15.003
She's very sad.

26:15.105 --> 26:17.673
And something about falling down, like,

26:17.775 --> 26:19.441
she falls down.

26:25.082 --> 26:28.116
I saw dozens of dead people
during my walk, but the dead man

26:28.219 --> 26:31.119
who can jump the living
had me the most concerned.

26:31.222 --> 26:34.156
He's stuck, kind of, in his death state.

26:34.258 --> 26:37.025
He had a very chiseled face.

26:37.127 --> 26:38.794
He had a strong jaw.

26:38.896 --> 26:40.562
And he was wearing a suit.

26:40.698 --> 26:43.665
And I want to show, like, the dead guy

26:43.801 --> 26:46.602
kind of entering the person's body.

26:49.640 --> 26:51.373
Is this what you saw?

26:53.460 --> 26:55.143
Yes.

27:17.067 --> 27:19.785
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:19.920 --> 27:21.520
we're ready to reveal our findings

27:21.622 --> 27:25.390
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

27:25.492 --> 27:27.793
So, Amy, I'd like you to meet Kimberly.

27:27.895 --> 27:30.028
Four years ago, this historic theater

27:30.164 --> 27:32.397
was pretty much gonna get torn down.

27:32.533 --> 27:33.982
She grew up in this town

27:34.068 --> 27:38.303
and wasn't about to let the
town's only theater fail.

27:38.405 --> 27:40.439
So she bought it.

27:40.541 --> 27:42.474
This is Paul. It's her dad.

27:42.559 --> 27:44.776
Paul spends a lot of
time here doing odd jobs.

27:44.862 --> 27:46.612
He's here almost every day.

27:46.714 --> 27:51.250
He seems to be the main target of
the paranormal activity in this place.

27:51.335 --> 27:54.653
Kimberly really wants
to keep the doors open,

27:54.755 --> 27:57.222
but not if it's gonna put her
family and employees at risk.

27:57.324 --> 27:59.258
So, with that, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy

27:59.360 --> 28:01.793
and see what she can
tell us about her walk.

28:03.764 --> 28:05.330
It was an interesting walk.

28:05.432 --> 28:11.603
I felt like I met anybody
who was dead in this town.

28:11.705 --> 28:14.039
It was absolutely overwhelming.

28:14.124 --> 28:19.528
The major thing that I felt
was anxiety and illness,

28:19.647 --> 28:24.683
which is associated with a
lot of the dead that are here.

28:24.785 --> 28:27.185
There's just
an overwhelming sense

28:27.288 --> 28:29.638
of unease and anxiety.

28:29.757 --> 28:32.174
Nobody wants to be here alone.

28:32.259 --> 28:35.527
I could see why.

28:37.648 --> 28:40.132
So the first person
that I met was a female.

28:40.217 --> 28:43.535
She was saying that she felt so old.

28:43.620 --> 28:45.337
I'm like, "Well, you know, how old?"

28:45.439 --> 28:46.688
She's like, "40."

28:46.807 --> 28:47.806
Oh, my.

28:47.941 --> 28:49.191
She was extremely sad.

28:49.310 --> 28:53.278
She did state that she had gone missing.

28:53.364 --> 28:55.480
She also wears this long, lace dress.

28:55.582 --> 28:58.083
And it was all wet.

28:58.168 --> 29:01.253
And then she was talking about,
like, a fight with her family

29:01.355 --> 29:04.006
and something about a guy.

29:04.091 --> 29:08.143
She did say that his name was Joe.

29:08.262 --> 29:12.331
I think that she was in love with him.

29:12.433 --> 29:14.983
The problems that she
has here, specifically,

29:15.102 --> 29:18.003
is she doesn't care for
the living very much.

29:18.105 --> 29:22.874
She feels like she's not wanted here.

29:22.976 --> 29:25.977
The pain I felt with her
was a lot of neck pain.

29:26.080 --> 29:28.630
It was extremely intense.

29:28.749 --> 29:32.234
And she was showing me her throwing a fit.

29:32.353 --> 29:34.419
The sound that I think
the living would hear

29:34.505 --> 29:36.254
would be, like, banging.

29:36.357 --> 29:38.924
- Oh, my God.
- Somebody going ballistic.

29:39.026 --> 29:40.409
You hear banging in the basement,

29:40.527 --> 29:42.260
- you were telling me.
- Mm-hmm.

29:42.346 --> 29:45.030
That's exactly what it sounds
like, metal hitting metal.

29:45.165 --> 29:46.698
- Yeah.
- You know, it's like a clanging.

29:46.800 --> 29:50.135
It's not your typical pipe noise.

29:50.237 --> 29:52.971
I heard two extremely loud noises

29:53.073 --> 29:55.073
after working here for about six months.

29:55.159 --> 30:01.696
One, I describe as dropping a
16-pound bowling ball 25 or 30 feet.

30:01.815 --> 30:03.198
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

30:03.317 --> 30:04.516
Okay.

30:04.601 --> 30:07.719
Well, I've got a pretty good
idea who you're talking about.

30:07.855 --> 30:09.421
April 10th of 1937,

30:09.523 --> 30:12.824
there was a 42-year-old woman
by the name of Nellie Price.

30:12.926 --> 30:16.495
She was on her way to a
date at a local nightclub.

30:16.580 --> 30:20.766
The man she was meeting
was a guy named Joe Smiley.

30:20.901 --> 30:23.402
Oh, my God.

30:23.504 --> 30:25.404
But she never made her date.

30:25.489 --> 30:27.172
She disappeared into thin air.

30:27.274 --> 30:30.442
The last place she was
seen was a car dealership,

30:30.544 --> 30:32.010
which was right next to the theater.

30:32.146 --> 30:34.162
- Mm-hmm.
- Now the town went into a panic

30:34.281 --> 30:36.882
was, like, all hands on
deck for a search for her.

30:37.017 --> 30:39.384
I got an article about her murder.

30:41.588 --> 30:43.555
Finally, 17 days later,

30:43.640 --> 30:46.057
she's found by a fisherman in a sandbar

30:46.193 --> 30:47.793
- in the Missouri River.
- Oh!

30:47.878 --> 30:49.528
Oh, my gosh.

30:49.613 --> 30:51.279
Right. Wet.

30:51.398 --> 30:52.731
Now, you mentioned something
about the neck, right?

30:52.866 --> 30:53.865
- Yes.
- Okay.

30:53.951 --> 30:57.702
So I got her death certificate right here.

30:57.838 --> 30:59.788
Cause of death is strangulation.

30:59.907 --> 31:02.257
Wow.

31:02.342 --> 31:04.092
Now, the police did question one suspect.

31:04.178 --> 31:05.343
It was this guy, Joe Smiley,

31:05.479 --> 31:11.066
that she was supposed to meet that night.

31:11.185 --> 31:12.417
Now, it's 77 years later,

31:12.553 --> 31:13.802
and it's still an unsolved case.

31:13.921 --> 31:15.253
Oh, my gosh.

31:15.389 --> 31:17.155
I didn't know that.

31:17.257 --> 31:19.975
I have her picture when she was a little...

31:20.093 --> 31:22.227
little bit younger.

31:22.312 --> 31:24.980
Wow.

31:25.065 --> 31:26.448
So, could that be her?

31:26.567 --> 31:29.868
I think so, yeah. Definitely.

31:29.953 --> 31:32.521
It's so unfair.

31:32.606 --> 31:36.675
I just feel heartbroken for her.

31:42.282 --> 31:43.748
What else did you see?

31:43.851 --> 31:46.051
I saw a lot going on up here,

31:46.153 --> 31:50.422
a lot with talking with the
dead up here, a lot of commotion.

31:50.557 --> 31:54.042
And one of the things that
I saw was shadow people.

31:56.363 --> 31:58.663
You can see them in the seats...

32:02.436 --> 32:04.402
swooping all over the place.

32:08.775 --> 32:10.542
Oh, my gosh.

32:10.644 --> 32:12.878
There was an incident

32:12.963 --> 32:15.614
where my staff member was starting a movie.

32:15.749 --> 32:18.750
And when she turned on the projector,

32:18.835 --> 32:21.953
this screen right here
showed a black shadow figure

32:22.055 --> 32:26.124
that was really large, almost
filling the whole screen.

32:26.210 --> 32:29.227
Wow.

32:29.363 --> 32:33.198
Then, I was in a hallway
that leads to the basement.

32:33.300 --> 32:37.369
And when I was back there, I
saw a dead guy on the floor.

32:37.471 --> 32:41.573
And he's very much
stuck in his death state.

32:41.675 --> 32:44.042
What I was able to get from him

32:44.144 --> 32:47.445
was that there was a woman screaming.

32:47.548 --> 32:48.513
She fell over,

32:48.615 --> 32:52.384
and it had something to do with him.

32:52.486 --> 32:56.438
And there was another male
who absolutely hated him,

32:56.557 --> 32:57.973
had it out for him.

32:58.058 --> 33:00.559
Like, this man felt hunted almost.

33:00.694 --> 33:04.713
And then he said the guy who
hated him finally got him.

33:04.798 --> 33:06.831
And then, what I felt

33:06.917 --> 33:10.602
was an impact on the
left side, in the heart,

33:10.687 --> 33:14.489
and exiting out the back.

33:14.608 --> 33:18.226
I thought that he was shot.

33:18.312 --> 33:20.912
Wow.

33:20.998 --> 33:23.782
Now, a lot of this stuff
she's just talking about

33:23.917 --> 33:25.483
reminds me of a deadly love triangle

33:25.586 --> 33:27.852
that started and ended
here in your theater.

33:27.955 --> 33:30.372
- Okay.
- What?

33:30.490 --> 33:31.623
Back in 1932,

33:31.708 --> 33:34.392
this guy, Frank Celoud,
moved his wife, Gladys,

33:34.478 --> 33:36.177
and infant daughter here to Marshall

33:36.263 --> 33:38.530
to manage this theater.

33:38.632 --> 33:42.534
This is Frank Celoud...

33:42.669 --> 33:46.121
and this is his wife, Gladys.

33:47.374 --> 33:49.908
Now, about six months
after they got into town,

33:50.010 --> 33:53.211
- Gladys started having an affair...
- Wow.

33:53.313 --> 33:55.513
with a 21-year-old factory worker.

33:55.616 --> 33:56.881
His name was Estel Turner.

33:56.967 --> 33:59.351
I've got his photo as well.

33:59.453 --> 34:01.419
Hmm.

34:01.555 --> 34:03.254
Frank confronted him. Said, "Listen."

34:03.323 --> 34:04.689
I know you're having
an affair with my wife.

34:04.791 --> 34:08.259
If you're gonna do that, just take her,

34:08.344 --> 34:10.795
- "but the deal is, you have to marry her."
- Wow.

34:10.880 --> 34:12.630
- Bizarre, right?
- Yeah.

34:12.733 --> 34:15.033
Estel says, "I don't want to
be breaking up anybody's family.

34:15.118 --> 34:18.803
I'll just leave her alone," and ends it.

34:18.938 --> 34:21.572
So now Frank thought
the whole thing was over,

34:21.675 --> 34:22.774
everything was fine.

34:22.876 --> 34:24.809
Then a month later, Frank
took Gladys to a dance

34:24.911 --> 34:27.012
right across the street
from the theater here.

34:27.097 --> 34:30.165
Guess who else was at the dance.

34:30.283 --> 34:31.815
Estel.

34:31.902 --> 34:34.853
He had the balls to come over
to his wife after everything,

34:34.938 --> 34:36.388
and try to get her to dance with him.

34:36.489 --> 34:38.523
- Oh, no.
- So Frank got in his face.

34:38.608 --> 34:42.409
He says, "If you don't leave
my wife alone, I'll kill you."

34:43.547 --> 34:45.246
Now, Frank was pretty fired up

34:45.331 --> 34:46.414
and he left.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.366
But Estel winded up following him,

34:48.452 --> 34:49.701
and they wound up getting
into another argument

34:49.835 --> 34:51.469
right in front of the theater.

34:51.571 --> 34:53.471
Witnesses can hear Frank telling Estel

34:53.572 --> 34:56.007
that you lied to me about
staying away from his wife.

34:56.109 --> 34:57.275
Okay.

34:57.377 --> 35:00.378
Pulls out a gun and puts
one right in his chest.

35:00.480 --> 35:01.096
- Oh, my God.
- Oh.

35:01.181 --> 35:03.732
Right into his spinal cord.

35:03.850 --> 35:06.551
I've got his death certificate here.

35:06.653 --> 35:10.187
It says, "Gunshot wounds at
the hands of Frank Celoud."

35:12.173 --> 35:13.058
- Wow.
- Wow.

35:13.160 --> 35:14.409
Hmm.

35:14.528 --> 35:15.710
- Did you guys know about this?
- No.

35:15.796 --> 35:18.213
I've been here 40 years, never heard of it.

35:18.298 --> 35:21.966
Now, do you think this
guy, Estel, is who you saw?

35:22.052 --> 35:23.168
I mean, there are...

35:23.253 --> 35:25.587
Obviously, there's a lot
of correlations there.

35:25.706 --> 35:26.971
Let me ask you a question.

35:27.074 --> 35:29.374
You mentioned the hallway
behind the screen. Uh-huh.

35:29.476 --> 35:33.078
So this is where Paul's
having a lot of interactions.

35:33.213 --> 35:35.647
I was working in the hall,

35:35.732 --> 35:38.817
and I felt a hand on my shoulder...

35:38.902 --> 35:40.168
on my left shoulder.

35:40.253 --> 35:41.636
I thought it was my daughter,

35:41.755 --> 35:45.390
but I turned around,
looked up and down the hall.

35:45.475 --> 35:46.541
There was nobody.

35:46.626 --> 35:48.393
Wow.

35:48.478 --> 35:51.012
That really concerns me,

35:51.098 --> 35:56.634
'cause he, like, comes
up from behind a lot.

35:56.720 --> 35:59.954
And he can jump people.

36:04.411 --> 36:08.913
I think that people would
feel almost frozen, physically,

36:09.015 --> 36:11.683
like they couldn't move or walk.

36:11.818 --> 36:15.053
They might even feel like
they're having a heart attack.

36:17.124 --> 36:20.125
The pain I felt was not typical.

36:20.227 --> 36:23.928
It was very severe and long-lasting.

36:24.030 --> 36:25.396
I have a condition

36:25.499 --> 36:29.467
that I got shortly after
we took over the theater.

36:29.569 --> 36:31.903
The doctors tell me I
should be getting better,

36:32.005 --> 36:33.204
but I'm not.

36:33.290 --> 36:35.673
I'm not getting better.
I'm not feeling better.

36:35.776 --> 36:36.558
The muscle pain, the spinal pain.

36:36.676 --> 36:38.109
Muscles, joints, spine.

36:38.245 --> 36:41.079
Yes, yes.

36:41.164 --> 36:42.831
Wow.

36:42.916 --> 36:46.951
I did do a sketch of what I saw.

36:56.997 --> 36:59.831
Wow. Take a look at this.

37:01.651 --> 37:02.901
Oh, my God.

37:20.263 --> 37:23.798
I did do a sketch of what I saw.

37:34.327 --> 37:37.195
Wow. Take a look at this.

37:38.198 --> 37:40.281
Oh, my God.

37:44.971 --> 37:46.304
That's scary.

37:50.443 --> 37:51.609
Now, we talked about Paul

37:51.695 --> 37:54.145
getting grabbed on the shoulder.

37:54.247 --> 37:58.049
Did it sound like it could be this guy?

37:58.151 --> 38:00.201
That would probably be him, yeah.

38:00.320 --> 38:02.220
I'm convinced that's him.

38:05.025 --> 38:07.091
What is his ultimate
goal when he does that?

38:07.194 --> 38:10.094
He wants people to feel how he feels.

38:10.180 --> 38:11.496
Period.

38:11.598 --> 38:13.932
Mm-hmm.

38:14.034 --> 38:15.200
I've got to tell you something.

38:15.302 --> 38:19.003
Paul had experiences earlier on in life.

38:19.105 --> 38:20.171
Mm-hmm.

38:20.273 --> 38:23.741
And he felt that he
somehow brought them here.

38:27.080 --> 38:28.413
- You don't think so?
- No.

38:28.498 --> 38:30.348
So that's got to make you feel better.

38:30.450 --> 38:33.051
Much better. I'm so glad you said that.

38:33.186 --> 38:36.521
I, uh, felt I had some ability

38:36.623 --> 38:42.160
to be a magnet for bad
things, so thank you.

38:45.632 --> 38:48.149
So, Kimberly, you saved
this theater for the people

38:48.268 --> 38:49.434
that live in your town.

38:49.536 --> 38:50.668
You had no way of knowing

38:50.770 --> 38:53.171
- it would also be a meeting place for the dead.
- No.

38:53.256 --> 38:54.389
All right. What's done is done.

38:54.507 --> 38:56.140
All right? We've got to look to the future.

38:56.276 --> 38:58.209
The question is, can you stay here safely

38:58.295 --> 38:59.961
with your family and employees,

39:00.046 --> 39:01.246
or is it time to get out

39:01.348 --> 39:05.116
and then take a wrecking
ball to this place?

39:05.252 --> 39:06.484
For that answer, I'm gonna turn it over

39:06.570 --> 39:07.785
to my partner, Amy.

39:10.724 --> 39:11.923
You have a lot going on here.

39:12.025 --> 39:17.195
So the goal is to help as many
people move on as possible,

39:17.297 --> 39:18.897
and to clear the building

39:18.999 --> 39:23.334
so that you guys can set up
a safe space for your family.

39:23.420 --> 39:26.788
So, the first thing, we
have the dead woman, Nellie.

39:26.907 --> 39:28.873
I think we all want to help her.

39:28.959 --> 39:33.311
And the best way to do that
is to have a female medium

39:33.413 --> 39:35.980
come in and spend some time with her

39:36.082 --> 39:38.182
and allow her to talk.

39:38.285 --> 39:39.601
What's very important

39:39.686 --> 39:43.421
is to also make the statement
from the medium to Nellie

39:43.523 --> 39:48.559
that, if she wants to bring
anybody else with her from here,

39:48.695 --> 39:50.028
to do it now.

39:50.113 --> 39:55.333
There will be a lot of dead
that want to go with her

39:55.468 --> 39:59.921
to the next, uh, place.

40:00.006 --> 40:02.640
Now, how do they get rid of
this guy who jumps people?

40:02.726 --> 40:08.079
So what we want to do is bring in a priest.

40:08.181 --> 40:11.316
I want him to come three
times over three months

40:11.418 --> 40:14.018
to do a blessing of the entire building.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.987
The other thing that the priest needs to do

40:16.072 --> 40:18.106
is to give him his last rites.

40:18.224 --> 40:19.891
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

40:20.026 --> 40:22.176
And then he'll leave.

40:22.262 --> 40:24.912
And where he goes, the shadow people go.

40:24.998 --> 40:26.698
Okay. So, you'll kill
two birds with one stone?

40:26.833 --> 40:28.132
Yes.

40:28.268 --> 40:29.767
There is one more step,
and this is something

40:29.853 --> 40:32.904
that you're doing to make
it peaceful and quiet here.

40:33.006 --> 40:34.372
There's a lot of residual here.

40:34.457 --> 40:36.924
There's a lot of timelines
that are overlapping and stuff,

40:37.043 --> 40:38.276
and this is just muck.

40:38.378 --> 40:39.560
So what I want you to do is,

40:39.646 --> 40:43.831
every month... every
month just take some salt.

40:43.917 --> 40:48.102
And in each location,
just sprinkle some salt.

40:48.188 --> 40:49.771
And while you're doing that, you're saying,

40:49.856 --> 40:51.789
"Only love, light and peace may enter.

40:51.925 --> 40:53.858
All negativity must go."

40:53.960 --> 40:56.461
And what that's gonna
do is just kind of build

40:56.546 --> 41:03.801
an energetic wall of
purity to keep the dead out.

41:03.903 --> 41:05.169
So, when they do all these steps,

41:05.271 --> 41:06.838
this place should be pretty good, then?

41:06.940 --> 41:08.806
Yes.

41:08.908 --> 41:10.608
You have a look of relief on your face.

41:10.694 --> 41:15.046
I'm very happy that
there can be a resolution.

41:15.148 --> 41:19.083
The cavalry. The cavalry is here.

41:19.169 --> 41:21.319
Do I even have to ask if
you're gonna take Amy's advice?

41:21.404 --> 41:24.956
I am definitely taking Amy's advice.

41:25.058 --> 41:26.257
It won't be easy

41:26.359 --> 41:29.394
removing the layers of
dead inside this location,

41:29.496 --> 41:31.512
but with the help of a medium and a priest,

41:31.631 --> 41:33.064
the dead will be set free,

41:33.166 --> 41:35.566
keeping Kimberly and her
employees and customers

41:35.668 --> 41:37.201
safe from harm.
