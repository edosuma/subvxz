-Wait, who's the lucky lady?
-It's complicated.

00:09.096 --> 00:10.923
Ray's got more of the balance
that I'm looking for.

00:10.967 --> 00:13.535
Built a family and a
relationship that's unshakeable.

00:13.578 --> 00:15.972

what they were saying</i>

00:16.016 --> 00:18.844
about going after the person
who tortured you.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.498
I was protecting you, baby.

00:20.542 --> 00:21.717
Building a wall between us

00:21.760 --> 00:23.719
isolates you from this family.

00:23.762 --> 00:25.851
Nobody's allowed to know
what we have.

00:25.895 --> 00:28.506

more reasons to break up

00:28.550 --> 00:30.639

01:01.452 --> 01:02.758

What?

01:02.801 --> 01:04.238
Uh, you know what?

01:04.281 --> 01:05.848
I am done betting on myself.

01:05.891 --> 01:07.937

uh, government

01:57.856 --> 02:01.164
or, uh, Ray and Clay
doubting my shooting skills.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.079
Yeah, you're right.
I should've known.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.081
Shooting's not
a perishable skill for Bravo 1.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.865
That trial
put no hitch in his giddyup.

02:06.909 --> 02:10.217
That's why that single malt
is gonna taste so damn sweet

02:10.260 --> 02:12.741
-on the Blonde Brutus's dime.
Time out.

02:12.784 --> 02:14.612
Can we talk
about something here? Scotch?

02:14.656 --> 02:16.310
Sonny, that's a little fancy
for a frogman.

02:16.353 --> 02:17.572
Bravo 1's a free man.

02:17.615 --> 02:19.139
Okay?
No better reason right there

02:19.182 --> 02:20.357
than to go top-shelf.

02:20.401 --> 02:22.098
Top-shelf!

02:22.142 --> 02:23.360
-Here you go, buddy.
-Yep! Yep.

02:23.404 --> 02:24.970
Hey, Sonny. Sonny,
Sonny, this...

02:25.014 --> 02:26.885
Listen up here, buddy.

02:26.929 --> 02:29.845
Since we won't be at the big
baby shower next week in Texas,

02:29.888 --> 02:32.761
Bravo owes you a proper
send-off into fatherhood.

02:32.804 --> 02:36.025
One that doesn't involve pin
the diaper on the donkey.

02:36.068 --> 02:37.635
There you go.

02:37.679 --> 02:40.769
Oh. Is this for, uh,
-the baby or me?
-Both of you.

02:40.812 --> 02:42.771
Kid's got to learn
to learn how to change you

02:42.814 --> 02:44.816
after a rough night
-there, buddy.
Oh.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.253
And learn how to drive

02:46.296 --> 02:47.993
to get your impaired ass home
from the boom-boom room.

02:48.037 --> 02:49.256
-Oh! Come on, now.
Yeah, you know what,
being a dad's

02:49.299 --> 02:50.605
not gonna be your only
nightmare.

02:50.648 --> 02:52.650
Oh, yeah. Come on. Come on.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.652
Aah, get out of here. Come on.

02:54.696 --> 02:56.219
Your guys's confidence

02:56.263 --> 02:59.527
in my, uh,
ability as a parent is, uh...

02:59.570 --> 03:03.052
It's overwhelming. Yeah.

03:03.966 --> 03:05.272
Where am I supposed to put this?

03:05.315 --> 03:07.578
In my cage? Come on.

03:10.842 --> 03:12.279
Hey. I'm sorry.

03:12.322 --> 03:14.803
I'm sure that had
-to be a little awkward.
-Uh,

03:14.846 --> 03:16.283
I can handle it.

03:16.326 --> 03:18.241
Well, it'll get easier
once you go to Echo and...

03:18.285 --> 03:20.374
you know, and then
you and Sonny can be public.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.203
Yeah, that would've
made things easier.

03:23.246 --> 03:25.422
What do you mean, "would've"?
You didn't get it?

03:25.466 --> 03:28.643
It went away
thanks to Jason's trial.

03:30.906 --> 03:32.299
Sorry.

03:32.342 --> 03:34.214
Where's that put you and Sonny?

03:36.259 --> 03:38.522
I got a lot of work to do.

03:39.349 --> 03:41.221
-All right.
-Okay.

03:46.878 --> 03:48.793
Do all the dogs get nail polish?

03:48.837 --> 03:50.926
-Yes.
-What's, uh, what's his name?

03:50.969 --> 03:53.233
This is Tilly,
and she's a terrier.

03:53.276 --> 03:55.191
Her best friend's Goliath,
but they don't always

03:55.235 --> 03:57.411
get along sometimes.
But they're still best friends.

03:57.454 --> 03:59.239
Yeah.

04:01.763 --> 04:03.982
Are you okay, Daddy?

04:05.636 --> 04:08.204
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, baby girl.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.597
Are you trying

04:09.640 --> 04:11.076
to tell Daddy something
with all these puppies?

04:11.120 --> 04:13.644
Yeah. They're more best friends
than him,

04:13.688 --> 04:14.906
which is kind of sad,
but it's just 'cause

04:14.950 --> 04:16.212
he's a little bit younger.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.692
I think his name
should be, like...

04:19.389 --> 04:21.391
Yo! Hey!

04:21.435 --> 04:23.828
Excuse me? Uh, excuse me.

04:23.872 --> 04:26.004
You mind holding off on the work
till we're back inside?

04:26.048 --> 04:27.615
I'll be done in a minute.

04:27.658 --> 04:29.530
She's a terrier.

04:29.573 --> 04:30.835
Her best friend ...y!

04:30.879 --> 04:32.359
-Hey!
Ray.

04:32.402 --> 04:33.490
-Raymond!
-Hey, I told you...

04:33.534 --> 04:35.057
Raymond.

04:36.014 --> 04:38.843
Please. You're scaring her.

04:47.461 --> 04:50.725
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

04:55.817 --> 04:57.471
Used some, uh...

04:57.514 --> 04:59.734
I used some orange bitters
in here this time.

04:59.777 --> 05:01.388
Ooh, fancy.

05:01.431 --> 05:03.433
-Can I try?
-Mm-hmm.

05:03.477 --> 05:05.957
All right. Cheers.

05:06.001 --> 05:07.611
-Cheers.
-Mm-hmm.

05:07.655 --> 05:09.091
Mmm.

05:09.134 --> 05:11.354
That's a good old-fashioned.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.443
-Hmm.
-You finally got it
dialed in, babe.

05:13.487 --> 05:16.403
Thanks to finally having
some free time from Bravo.

05:16.446 --> 05:19.362
-Mm.
-Jason's trial was pretty
inconvenient for us.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.930
I mean, I always imagined
moving in together would mean

05:21.973 --> 05:23.932
more together, but we
have plenty of time

05:23.975 --> 05:25.194
to make this place ours.

05:25.237 --> 05:26.761
I understand
that you had to be there

05:26.804 --> 05:28.284
for Jason.
He's not just your team leader.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.765
Yeah. No, sure, I...

05:30.808 --> 05:32.332
I look up to him as an operator,

05:32.375 --> 05:33.811
but I told you, you know,

05:33.855 --> 05:35.726
Ray's got the home front balance
that I want.

05:35.770 --> 05:38.033
So, you're gonna operate
like Jason

05:38.076 --> 05:41.384
-and domesticate like Ray?
-Mm-hmm.

05:41.428 --> 05:42.777
All right.

05:44.822 --> 05:46.998
All right, so,

05:47.042 --> 05:49.261
back to the big plan here.

05:49.305 --> 05:51.307
We ply Dr. Waters and his wife
with booze

05:51.351 --> 05:53.265
so he'll put you
on the curriculum committee.

05:53.309 --> 05:54.963
Well, hopefully,
my, uh, track record

05:55.006 --> 05:56.617
in the English
department will do that.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.140
Cocktails can't hurt.

05:58.183 --> 06:00.621
Neither will your, uh,
dazzling personality.

06:00.664 --> 06:03.580
Well, I've been reading up
on my Flannery O'Connor, so...

06:03.624 --> 06:05.495
Things we do for love.

06:05.539 --> 06:07.628
If only bourbon would solve
how to make this place

06:07.671 --> 06:10.195
into an acceptable
dining area.

06:10.239 --> 06:12.328
Maybe we should just make
a reservation somewhere.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.590
-You know?
-No.

06:13.634 --> 06:15.026
You promised him
a home-cooked meal

06:15.070 --> 06:16.550
in your new place,
and we're gonna deliver.

06:16.593 --> 06:18.378
Okay?

06:24.035 --> 06:26.298
Thought you went home.

06:26.342 --> 06:28.170
I did.

06:28.213 --> 06:31.434
After all that waiting around
during your trial,

06:31.478 --> 06:35.438
I realized I needed to knock
the rust off in the gym.

06:35.482 --> 06:37.919
That the only rust
that needs knocking off?

06:38.702 --> 06:40.574
Jordan's in my rearview.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.838
So is Raqqa Jacques, the trial,
all of it.

06:43.881 --> 06:45.187
I'm front-sight focused.

06:45.230 --> 06:47.581
-You slayed your dragon.
-Yours, too.

06:47.624 --> 06:50.714
About damn time we
-found the next one, huh?
-Yeah.

06:52.150 --> 06:56.633
Hey, you keep in touch
with, uh, Papadakis?

06:56.677 --> 06:59.201
Theo?
Yeah.

06:59.244 --> 07:01.072
We exchange texts
every once in a while. Why?

07:01.116 --> 07:02.857
Yeah, he wrote me this,
uh, letter

07:02.900 --> 07:04.511
for the, uh, "good sailor" book.

07:04.554 --> 07:06.948
Ah, and after being
sequestered during the trial,

07:06.991 --> 07:08.471
you realized
how much it sucks being alone

07:08.515 --> 07:09.777
without your brothers.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.387
Yeah, he was, uh...

07:11.431 --> 07:15.260
He was there for me, and I just
wish I had been there for him.

07:16.653 --> 07:20.657
It's not exactly like you
to look at the past, brother.

07:20.701 --> 07:22.180
Yeah.

07:22.224 --> 07:25.009
Trial just brought things up
in me.

07:25.053 --> 07:27.795
Guilt, grief, remorse.

07:27.838 --> 07:29.710
Team guy buried treasure.

07:30.493 --> 07:32.190
Kind that don't
make us rich, right?

07:32.234 --> 07:34.802
Theo's letter
meant something to me.

07:34.845 --> 07:36.934
Helped me lighten the load.

07:37.805 --> 07:39.546
Well, if it means
that much to you,

07:39.589 --> 07:41.025
he's up in Seaford.

07:41.069 --> 07:43.288
About an hour away.

08:04.614 --> 08:05.746
Theo.

08:05.789 --> 08:08.096
Hey.

08:08.139 --> 08:10.881
-It's been a long time.
-Yeah.

08:12.317 --> 08:14.189
Here you go.

08:14.232 --> 08:16.800
-Here.
-Thanks, man. Cheers.

08:16.844 --> 08:18.889
Here's to, uh, Bravo,
past and present.

08:18.933 --> 08:20.630
But mostly past.

08:20.674 --> 08:22.110
Have a seat.

08:22.153 --> 08:24.591
How're my former teammates?

08:24.634 --> 08:28.464
Sonny and Ray
are the only ones left?

08:28.508 --> 08:29.726
Well, Sonny, he's, uh...

08:29.770 --> 08:31.075
Look at that.

08:31.119 --> 08:32.816
Sonny's having a kid.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.557
A kid?

08:34.601 --> 08:36.603
And, uh, Ray, well...

08:36.646 --> 08:38.866
He's still den mother?

08:40.520 --> 08:43.044
-Pretty much.
-Yeah.

08:43.087 --> 08:45.133
I heard about his captivity.

08:45.176 --> 08:47.657
-How's he holding up?
-He's good.
He's good. You know,

08:47.701 --> 08:50.617
all that training that we do
helped get him through it,

08:50.660 --> 08:52.009
so he's gonna be all right.

08:52.053 --> 08:54.446
-Ignore and override?
-Ignore and override.

08:54.490 --> 08:56.187
Yeah.

09:00.061 --> 09:01.497
Look, I, uh...

09:01.541 --> 09:03.934
I really a-appreciate the...

09:03.978 --> 09:05.849
that letter you wrote me.

09:05.893 --> 09:07.590
Means a lot.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.157
The least I could do
for the best door-kicker

09:09.200 --> 09:10.637
I've ever worked with.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.378
That's high praise coming
from the one teammate

09:13.422 --> 09:15.859
I couldn't catch
on the O-Course.

09:15.903 --> 09:19.341
Think I was fast then,
you should see me now.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.823
Half the man,

09:22.866 --> 09:24.564
twice the frogman.

09:25.608 --> 09:27.567
It was Afghanistan.

09:27.610 --> 09:29.656
Zhari District.

09:29.699 --> 09:31.527
October 2013.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.573
You were chasing down
some Talimonster.

09:33.616 --> 09:34.704
Grenade in the hallway.

09:34.748 --> 09:36.750
-Bad deal.
-You did your job.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.708
Bagged the HVT, got me home.

09:38.752 --> 09:41.929
Well, most of me.

09:43.713 --> 09:45.454
So, how long has it been?

09:45.497 --> 09:48.675
Geez, seems like...
When's the last time I saw you?

09:48.718 --> 09:50.938
You can't remember that,
but you can remember

09:50.981 --> 09:52.896
the worst day of my life
perfectly?

09:54.855 --> 09:57.161
Uh...

09:57.205 --> 09:59.076
The last time I saw you,

09:59.120 --> 10:00.861
I invited you over
for a barbecue,

10:00.904 --> 10:02.906
celebrate my new leg.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.213
You never showed.

10:05.256 --> 10:07.215
Well, I'm here now.

10:08.738 --> 10:11.175
Jameelah's finally asleep.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.308
I told her you were
under a lot of stress at work.

10:13.351 --> 10:15.658
She asked me what made it
different than other times.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.791
I didn't know what to say.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.227
I'm okay, Naima.

10:19.270 --> 10:21.446
-I promise.
-It's one thing to hide

10:21.490 --> 10:22.970
you're sleeping down here
from the kids,

10:23.013 --> 10:24.406
but now you're scaring them.

10:24.449 --> 10:25.973
I'm just wound up
from the trial, that's all.

10:26.016 --> 10:27.714
You haven't been right
for weeks now.

10:27.757 --> 10:29.193
<i>We</i> haven't been right.

10:30.978 --> 10:32.283
If you're not going
to talk to me,

10:32.327 --> 10:33.937
then you need
to talk to someone.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.635
I...

10:35.678 --> 10:37.593
Been there. Okay, baby?

10:37.637 --> 10:40.117
I've checked all those boxes
with the Navy shrinks

10:40.161 --> 10:41.466
and been declared fit
to operate, okay?

10:41.510 --> 10:43.730
"Fit to operate"
isn't the same thing

10:43.773 --> 10:45.296
as "fit to live with."

10:48.038 --> 10:49.953
Maybe it's better if I'm gone.

11:04.533 --> 11:07.231
I never could stop myself
from tinkering with my gear.

11:07.275 --> 11:10.191
-Yeah.
-Hawking knives
was a logical next step.

11:10.234 --> 11:12.193
You know what, seems
like business is good.

11:12.236 --> 11:14.717
Mm. Kept me busy.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.153
Needed that.

11:16.197 --> 11:17.981
The transition out of the
teams-- was that rough?

11:18.025 --> 11:21.419
Uh, I lost my leg, lost
my brothers, lost the chaos.

11:21.463 --> 11:23.073
-Chaos.
-Yeah.

11:23.117 --> 11:27.643
Took me a long time to realize
I needed to forgive myself.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.644
For what?

11:28.688 --> 11:31.299
Things we saw,
things we did.

11:31.342 --> 11:33.344
I know we were on the
right side of things,

11:33.388 --> 11:36.260
but doesn't mean everything
we did feels right.

11:36.304 --> 11:37.653
You know what
chaps my ass?

11:37.697 --> 11:40.482
Ancient cultures,
the Greeks, the samurai,

11:40.525 --> 11:42.571
they knew that they had
to sanitize their warriors

11:42.614 --> 11:44.138
after battle to help them heal.

11:44.181 --> 11:45.705
But not here.

11:45.748 --> 11:49.273
Public doesn't want to see
the things that we can't unsee.

11:49.317 --> 11:52.320
I mean, it's like,
"Thank you for your service.

11:52.363 --> 11:54.148
Good luck restoring your soul."

11:54.191 --> 11:55.671
Well, amen to that.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.629
Seems like you figured it out
though.

11:57.673 --> 12:00.328
Yeah, would've been easier if I
wasn't popping oxy every day.

12:01.590 --> 12:02.809
Was that a parting gift
from your leg?

12:04.680 --> 12:07.422
I was actually using a lot
more while I was on Bravo.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.034
I never noticed.

12:11.078 --> 12:13.558
Because you
didn't want to.

12:14.385 --> 12:15.952
You saw what

12:15.996 --> 12:17.475
mission success.

12:17.519 --> 12:18.912
I don't think that's fair.

12:18.955 --> 12:21.871
Man, I was pumping more
pills than Big Pharma.

12:21.915 --> 12:24.221
And as long as I was
pulling my weight downrange,

12:24.265 --> 12:25.353
that's all
you cared about.

12:25.396 --> 12:26.833
I'm saying,
as the team leader,

12:26.876 --> 12:28.922
it's my job to make sure
that my men get home safe.

12:28.965 --> 12:30.053
Look, brother,

12:30.097 --> 12:31.881
I forgave you
a long time ago.

12:31.925 --> 12:35.276
I learned not to expect you to
be something that you're not.

12:35.319 --> 12:36.799
What do you mean by that?

12:38.496 --> 12:42.239
You weren't personally invested
in my issues.

12:42.283 --> 12:44.372
You were my team leader,

12:44.415 --> 12:46.548
nothing more.

12:59.256 --> 13:01.084
Hey.

13:01.911 --> 13:05.219
Never seen you hang that
anywhere that wasn't a C-17.

13:05.262 --> 13:08.439
S.A. busywork kept me
after hours.

13:09.963 --> 13:13.096
Decided to crashed here as not
to bother the family, you know?

13:13.140 --> 13:14.663
Yeah.

13:14.706 --> 13:17.535
You, uh...

13:17.579 --> 13:20.321
you always bring a go bag
when you work late?

13:24.804 --> 13:26.327
I, uh...

13:26.370 --> 13:28.198
needed some space
to cool off.

13:28.242 --> 13:31.288
You'll learn that
soon enough.

13:34.683 --> 13:37.033
Hey, why don't you
come crash with us.

13:37.077 --> 13:40.210
Come on, man. DEVGRU sleepover's
a lonely straw to pull.

13:40.254 --> 13:41.777
Uh...

13:41.821 --> 13:43.779
You and Stella
should be enjoying

13:43.823 --> 13:45.433
the perks of cohabitation.

13:45.476 --> 13:47.000
I'm not gonna impose on that.

13:47.043 --> 13:48.871
Come on.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.003
She won't mind.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.179
Come on, dude.

13:52.222 --> 13:53.789
Naima would kill me
if I let you sleep in here

13:53.833 --> 13:55.835
with Sonny's
nasty-ass laundry pile.

14:00.187 --> 14:01.841
-All right.
-All right?

14:01.884 --> 14:03.799
Yeah.

14:11.502 --> 14:12.808
Lieutenant Davis.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.636
After the disappointing news
of Echo,

14:14.679 --> 14:17.900
I think I have something
promising to pass along.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.771
An opportunity.

14:20.990 --> 14:21.991
At SOCOM?

14:22.035 --> 14:23.471
You'd be serving
every Tier One asset

14:23.514 --> 14:24.820
in the United States
military.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.561
I'd hate to lose you,
but, uh,

14:26.604 --> 14:28.171
once-in-a-career opening.

14:28.215 --> 14:29.781
Yes, sir. It is.

14:29.825 --> 14:32.393
Course, you'd have
to leave Virginia Beach.

14:32.436 --> 14:33.960
Do you have a problem with that?

14:37.224 --> 14:39.966
No. No problem at all, sir.

14:41.228 --> 14:45.362
You know, SOCOM would be,
uh, very lucky to have you.

14:46.755 --> 14:49.410
So I hope you consider it.

14:49.453 --> 14:51.412
Thank you.

14:51.455 --> 14:54.154
-Sir.
-Master Chief.

14:54.197 --> 14:55.851
Yeah.

15:01.074 --> 15:02.684
I just overhead.
SOCOM?

15:02.727 --> 15:04.120
Wow.
You would, uh...

15:04.164 --> 15:06.470
You'd leave Bravo,
with all-all your history here?

15:06.514 --> 15:08.908
Honestly, the
history's the why.

15:08.951 --> 15:11.301
I mean, I started out
changing batteries on NODs,

15:11.345 --> 15:14.435
and now I'm responsible for
sending you all into the fire.

15:14.478 --> 15:16.132
After all this time,

15:16.176 --> 15:17.655
you're more than just operators.

15:17.699 --> 15:19.092
You're family.

15:21.398 --> 15:23.923
Job would be a lot easier
if we aren't.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.663
The job would be a lot easier

15:25.707 --> 15:28.623
if I could see everyone
as their call signs first.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.366
I wish I was more
like you, Jason,

15:32.409 --> 15:34.803
but I'm not.

15:44.204 --> 15:45.509
Oh!

15:45.553 --> 15:47.163
Like what you done
with the place.

15:47.207 --> 15:48.164
Thanks.

15:48.208 --> 15:49.949
I can take
zero credit.

15:53.213 --> 15:54.214
Hi, honey.

15:54.257 --> 15:55.345
-Hey.
-Hey.

15:55.389 --> 15:56.607
-Mwah.
-Mwah.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.609
-Hello. Welcome.
-Hey. Hey.

15:58.653 --> 16:00.437
Come here.

16:01.264 --> 16:03.049
Come on.
Uh, make yourself at home.

16:03.092 --> 16:04.920
It's already kind
of you to take me in.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.400
I don't need a
five-star spread.

16:06.443 --> 16:08.880
Oh, well, you're lucky,
'cause I don't usually make one.

16:09.707 --> 16:12.232
This is not for me.
I'm intruding.

16:12.275 --> 16:13.929
I had a work thing
scheduled,

16:13.973 --> 16:15.322
and everything
was halfway there anyway

16:15.365 --> 16:17.063
when Clay called and said
that you were coming.

16:17.106 --> 16:19.152
So I just figured it'd be easier
to finish the thought.

16:19.195 --> 16:23.112
Plus, it's better that our first
guest should be family, right?

16:23.156 --> 16:25.419
I don't want to
put you guys out.

16:25.462 --> 16:26.594
You're not
putting us out.

16:26.637 --> 16:29.075
Plus, I get
to test out the menu.

16:29.118 --> 16:30.250
On you.

16:30.293 --> 16:32.252
Work out the kinks.

16:32.295 --> 16:35.429
But you should maybe call Naima
and tell her that you're here.

16:35.472 --> 16:36.517
She-she must be worried.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.866
Yeah, she probably is.

16:37.909 --> 16:39.259
I'll give her a call.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.000
Okay.

16:50.487 --> 16:51.967
I'm sorry about...

16:52.011 --> 16:54.100
about dinner with ..., no, no, no, no.

16:54.143 --> 16:56.798
Just two months ago,
I held Naima's hand as she...

16:56.841 --> 16:59.540
faced the reality of maybe
never seeing Ray alive again.

16:59.583 --> 17:02.325
And now he's sleeping
on our couch.

17:02.369 --> 17:05.111
It puts things
in perspective.

17:08.201 --> 17:10.072
<i>Gentlemen,
apologies for the short notice,</i>

17:10.116 --> 17:11.726
but Charlie Team
has been stood down

17:11.769 --> 17:14.163
after their OIC
was injured in a car accident.

17:14.207 --> 17:17.079
You will deploy
in their place for eight weeks.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.298
Wheels up at 2000.

17:18.341 --> 17:20.213
-We're leaving
for two months,

17:20.256 --> 17:21.344
no warning?

17:21.388 --> 17:23.042
The old Tier One
heads-up.

17:23.085 --> 17:23.825
Where we headed?

17:23.868 --> 17:25.087
Northwest Africa

17:25.131 --> 17:26.306
and the Sahel.

17:26.349 --> 17:27.394
I lived there
with my grandparents.

17:27.437 --> 17:28.569
They were
missionaries.

17:28.612 --> 17:29.657
Area's rife
with tribalism,

17:29.700 --> 17:31.180
corruption and terrorism.

17:31.224 --> 17:33.313
Turning the region into a new
playground for AQ and ISIS.

17:33.356 --> 17:34.879
-Continent's
natural resources

17:34.923 --> 17:36.838
have appeal
to global superpowers, too.

17:36.881 --> 17:39.493
Russia and China have each taken
their own bites of the apple

17:39.536 --> 17:41.016
over the past two decades.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.062
They've traded weapons
and infrastructure

17:43.105 --> 17:45.107
for mineral rights
and political power

17:45.151 --> 17:47.066
in at least a dozen
developing nations.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.806
And after the drawdown
in Afghanistan,

17:48.850 --> 17:50.982
this is SOCOM's next primary AO.

17:51.026 --> 17:52.288
Your tasking
while deployed

17:52.332 --> 17:53.681
will be degrading

17:53.724 --> 17:55.944
the military capabilities
of Boko Haram,

17:55.987 --> 17:58.686
which have increased
significantly in recent months.

17:58.729 --> 18:00.383
Yeah, they've been running
around unchecked

18:00.427 --> 18:01.732
for over a decade.

18:01.776 --> 18:03.604
It's time we get reacquainted
with 'em.

18:03.647 --> 18:04.996
Warrant Officer Perry,

18:05.040 --> 18:06.346
you'll be read in
on the Ops Order en route.

18:06.389 --> 18:09.262
Roger that. But, um,
where exactly is "there"?

18:09.305 --> 18:10.872
There are no bases
in Western Africa.

18:10.915 --> 18:12.874
No. But there is the USS <i>Keating</i>

18:12.917 --> 18:14.789
sailing off the
coast of Nigeria.

18:14.832 --> 18:16.095
Oh, come on, man.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.140
Seriously,
I did not join the Navy

18:18.184 --> 18:20.751
-to end up on a damn ship.
-Well, at least
it's not a submarine, Sonny.

18:20.795 --> 18:23.450
-Well, it's not the Navy
without the water, Sonny.

18:23.493 --> 18:25.104
So, time to sink or swim.

18:30.848 --> 18:31.849
All right, boys.
Yeah, man.

18:43.252 --> 18:44.253
Sonny, you good?

18:44.297 --> 18:46.386
Yeah.
You know, uh,

18:46.429 --> 18:49.084
can't say that spending
the next eight weeks

18:49.128 --> 18:52.392
nuts-to-butts with my fellow
sailors has got me all tingly.

18:52.435 --> 18:56.222
Yeah. Yeah, you know, uh...

18:56.265 --> 18:58.746
It's a good thing that
you're missing this baby shower.

18:58.789 --> 19:01.270
I mean, outside the wire,
that's your happy place.

19:03.403 --> 19:05.579
I would much rather be
at the baby shower

19:05.622 --> 19:08.495
than taking
Navy showers.

19:08.538 --> 19:09.844
Besides, uh,

19:09.887 --> 19:11.193
Hannah's due in six weeks,

19:11.237 --> 19:13.239
and even I can do the math.

19:13.282 --> 19:14.675
This is your job, man.

19:14.718 --> 19:16.155
Don't beat yourself up.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.504
-Yeah. Right?
-Yeah.

19:17.547 --> 19:20.768
I'm, uh, better equipped
to be a executioner

19:20.811 --> 19:22.552
than a nurturer anyway.

19:23.988 --> 19:25.947
Look, man, I-I
know how you feel.

19:25.990 --> 19:29.646
I do. I-I wasn't always
there for my kids either.

19:30.473 --> 19:32.823
You know, one thing you could
do is update your will.

19:32.867 --> 19:34.216
Yeah. Update your will.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.566
In case you get killed
over there, then...

19:36.610 --> 19:38.351
your kid has all your benefits.

19:38.394 --> 19:40.440
Right.
Might-might as well, uh ...ah.

19:40.483 --> 19:43.312
be good for something anyway,
right?

19:43.356 --> 19:44.531
Okay.

19:44.574 --> 19:46.228
That's a good chat.

19:46.272 --> 19:47.795
Good chat.

19:47.838 --> 19:49.275
<i>And by the time I'm back,</i>

19:49.318 --> 19:51.799
you'll be a member
of the curriculum committee.

19:51.842 --> 19:54.018
Without you playing
bartender tomorrow night,

19:54.062 --> 19:56.282
I am not so sure.

19:57.283 --> 20:00.111
I hate leaving when
we're just settling in.

20:00.155 --> 20:01.417
Yeah.

20:01.461 --> 20:02.810
Have to learn how
to handle things without you.

20:02.853 --> 20:04.072
Might as well start now.

20:04.115 --> 20:05.900
-Right?
-Mm.

20:07.945 --> 20:09.817
-Did you hear anything about Ray?
-Uh...

20:09.860 --> 20:12.341
Yeah, he was-- he was headed
home to make things right

20:12.385 --> 20:13.734
before we take off.

20:13.777 --> 20:15.997
Hope it's something
they can fix in a few hours.

20:17.694 --> 20:19.783
They've made it work for years.

20:19.827 --> 20:21.002
My money's on them.

20:21.045 --> 20:23.004
If they can't
make it, who can?

20:28.879 --> 20:31.012
Here we go. Ah, there it is!

20:32.100 --> 20:34.711
Meet the, uh,
famous Cerberus.

20:34.755 --> 20:37.584
I appreciate you, uh,
taking care of him

20:37.627 --> 20:39.020
-while I'm away.
-Yeah.

20:39.063 --> 20:41.327
Will be good to have
some company around here.

20:41.370 --> 20:46.288
Might help me find the next
former Mrs. Papadakis.

20:46.332 --> 20:47.550
You know, uh...

20:48.377 --> 20:50.684
I should've been there for you
after the injury.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.469
And I wasn't.

20:53.513 --> 20:54.862
And I'm sorry about that.

20:54.905 --> 20:57.038
And that guilt made you feel

20:57.081 --> 20:59.345
like some companionship
might do me some good?

20:59.388 --> 21:01.216
He's more
than a companion.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.305
That's a national treasure
right there.

21:03.349 --> 21:04.698
Hope some of that greatness

21:04.741 --> 21:06.265
rubs off on you.

21:07.875 --> 21:10.791
Yeah, I'll-I'll take it.
I'll take it.

21:10.834 --> 21:12.445
But I don't need
your help right now.

21:12.488 --> 21:14.751
Your teammates do.

21:15.535 --> 21:17.537
My teammates know
I have their six.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.060
Yeah.

21:19.103 --> 21:21.845
But being a SEAL was all I knew.

21:21.889 --> 21:23.499
And my reentry process

21:23.543 --> 21:26.328
after my injury would've
been a hell of a lot smoother

21:26.372 --> 21:29.984
without a busted marriage
and popping pills.

21:30.027 --> 21:32.160
And all that baggage
that comes from war--

21:32.203 --> 21:35.642
it just doesn't go away
when you stop.

21:36.469 --> 21:39.602
Easiest part about being
an operator happens

21:39.646 --> 21:41.082
outside the wire.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.824
So if you really want
to protect your brothers,

21:43.867 --> 21:48.132
you can't just be their sheepdog
when you're downrange.

21:49.612 --> 21:51.832
Yeah.

21:53.529 --> 21:55.879
Nothing like a diabetic coma
to send me off right, huh?

21:55.923 --> 21:58.447
Well, you did let RJ
make your sundae.

21:58.491 --> 22:00.623
Kid's got zero
impulse control.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.886
His mama's sweet tooth.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.282
Hey, um...

22:07.326 --> 22:10.198
listen, baby, I'm...

22:10.241 --> 22:13.984
I'm-I'm sorry
for blowing up the other day.

22:14.028 --> 22:16.639
It's just with my
ops going sideways

22:16.683 --> 22:19.163
and being away from
this family, I...

22:19.207 --> 22:22.079
I feel like I'm coming up short
on all fronts.

22:22.123 --> 22:24.125
Which is why I keep telling you
I'm here to help.

22:24.168 --> 22:27.084
No, baby. It's on me
to handle my business.

22:30.218 --> 22:32.002
Hey, but...

22:32.046 --> 22:35.397
we'll work the problem
when I'm back.

22:35.441 --> 22:37.834
Together.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.969
Yeah.

22:51.935 --> 22:53.937
I got that damn
butterscotch taste in my mouth.

22:53.981 --> 22:55.722
You got any mints?

22:57.680 --> 22:59.378
What the hell?

23:00.944 --> 23:03.860
What's this cash for?

23:06.776 --> 23:08.735
In case of
any problems.

23:08.778 --> 23:10.867
Problems like what?

23:15.872 --> 23:18.135
Oh.

23:19.310 --> 23:21.400
I see.

23:23.967 --> 23:25.665
I'm the problem.

23:25.708 --> 23:27.406
No, Ray.

23:27.449 --> 23:31.845
The problem's whatever you've
bottled up inside since Tunisia.

23:31.888 --> 23:33.412
I've tried to
be patient,

23:33.455 --> 23:35.631
but losing it on our neighbor
in front of Jameelah?

23:35.675 --> 23:37.285
You're like a
time bomb.

23:37.328 --> 23:38.808
And I won't let
our kids get caught

23:38.852 --> 23:41.202
in the explosion
when you go off.

23:45.249 --> 23:47.208
Problem solved.

23:47.251 --> 23:49.732
You won't have to worry
about me for two months.

23:55.346 --> 23:56.696
You know I had a streak going?

23:56.739 --> 23:58.045
Most consecutive deployments

23:58.088 --> 24:00.395
in the teams not
on a ship. Yeah.

24:00.439 --> 24:03.093
I am the Cal Ripken
of sticking to dry land.

24:03.137 --> 24:05.052
Hey, can you
do me a favor please

24:05.095 --> 24:07.010
and tell Clay that we're done

24:07.054 --> 24:10.100
so he stops inadvertently
pouring salt in our wounds?

24:10.144 --> 24:12.102
Our wounds? Well,
this is the first

24:12.146 --> 24:14.017
non-work-related
conversation we've had.

24:14.061 --> 24:15.889
Of course. I mean,
it's hard coming

24:15.932 --> 24:17.456
to work with you...

24:17.499 --> 24:19.936
If we're gonna be cooped up
on a ship together,

24:19.980 --> 24:22.112
boundaries are even
more important.

24:22.156 --> 24:24.898
Well, we're still friends,
ain't we?

24:24.941 --> 24:27.248
Friends is a
gateway for us.

24:27.291 --> 24:29.772
We got to be mature
about this.

24:36.562 --> 24:40.827
So, uh, Stella okay
with you blowing out?

24:40.870 --> 24:43.743
Yeah. Yeah, no,
I guess so.

24:43.786 --> 24:45.658
She's good.

24:45.701 --> 24:46.920
Hey, Ray.

24:46.963 --> 24:48.965
-Yo.
-First deployment
I can remember

24:49.009 --> 24:50.445
us not walking
on together.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.534
Sorry. Family wanted
every second I could give them.

24:52.578 --> 24:54.057
Never gets easier, does it?

24:54.101 --> 24:56.756
Getting yanked from
the home front with no warning

24:56.799 --> 24:58.148
is never easy.

24:58.192 --> 24:59.933
Well, it's not
Bravo's first rodeo.

24:59.976 --> 25:01.587
Let's hope so.

25:01.630 --> 25:04.285
Still a lot of eyes on the team
despite your acquittal.

25:04.328 --> 25:05.852
Bravo needs to keep things
on the straight and narrow

25:05.895 --> 25:07.244
the next eight weeks.

25:07.288 --> 25:08.811
There's anything
you need to worry about,

25:08.855 --> 25:09.986
I'll let you know.

25:10.030 --> 25:14.687
Trust me, my team is primed.

25:31.660 --> 25:34.315
♪ The battle ain't over

25:34.358 --> 25:36.099

You guys are down there.

26:20.230 --> 26:21.841
Officers' berths are this way.

26:21.884 --> 26:23.538
Oh, I see how it is.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.367
Warrant Officer Perry's too good
for his enlisted man racks.

26:26.410 --> 26:28.021
Ready briefing's
in an hour.

26:28.064 --> 26:30.327
See you boys then.

26:35.724 --> 26:37.421
Oh.

26:44.080 --> 26:46.692
Oh. Get comfy, boys.

26:46.735 --> 26:48.694
This makes our hooches at
FOB Fenty feel like the Ritz.

26:48.737 --> 26:51.218
That's for sure.
Hey, well, these tight quarters?

26:51.261 --> 26:53.350
No way you're gonna
be able to escape

26:53.394 --> 26:55.570
-Full Metal's night terrors.
-You know what's scary?

26:55.614 --> 26:58.399
I <i>don't</i> sleep. Think about that.

26:59.835 --> 27:02.882
Lack of vitamin D,
sober as a Mormon,

27:02.925 --> 27:04.405
competing for
breathable air.

27:04.448 --> 27:06.712
No free men should
live like this.

27:06.755 --> 27:08.844
There's no freedom in the Navy.

27:08.888 --> 27:10.498
All right?
You want to get some air?

27:10.541 --> 27:12.456
Go to the gear room,
unload some pallets.

27:12.500 --> 27:13.936
Here, help him out, will you?
Do something with yourselves.

27:13.980 --> 27:15.242
Come on, sunshine, let's go.

27:15.285 --> 27:17.070
Let's turn that
frown upside down.

27:17.113 --> 27:19.681
<i>Things looked a little icy
earlier with you and Davis.</i>

27:19.725 --> 27:21.291
-Is everything good?
-Yeah.

27:21.335 --> 27:23.032
I heard about her
not getting the Echo job.

27:23.076 --> 27:25.687
Yeah, the Davis fire
is officially out.

27:25.731 --> 27:27.994
Just too many hurdles
for us to jump over.

27:28.037 --> 27:30.213
I'm sorry, man.

27:30.257 --> 27:32.563
Well, you know, once
you're back stateside,

27:32.607 --> 27:34.087
it's a new chapter.

27:34.130 --> 27:35.523
You'll be a dad.

27:35.566 --> 27:38.134
Yeah, except having a kid

27:38.178 --> 27:41.834
and being a dad are
two completely different things.

27:41.877 --> 27:43.270
You can do both.

27:43.313 --> 27:45.664
C-Come on, man.

27:45.707 --> 27:47.709
I mean, you heard
what the guy said about me.

27:47.753 --> 27:50.016
I'm not exactly dad material.

27:50.059 --> 27:53.193
You know, the thing with Davis--
at least I had a fighting chance

27:53.236 --> 27:54.716
of keeping my
act together.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.110
There's just
no way in hell

27:57.153 --> 27:59.416
my knuckle-dragger
ass is gonna be able

27:59.460 --> 28:01.680
to handle this
dad thing alone.

28:02.898 --> 28:05.292
Look, Davis was with you
because of who you are,

28:05.335 --> 28:07.686
not who she made you.

28:08.991 --> 28:11.167
Quinn, I need someone
to rep Bravo

28:11.211 --> 28:12.473
at General Quarters each day.

28:12.516 --> 28:14.997
Think you can
-handle that?
-Yes, sir.

28:17.043 --> 28:20.786
Oh, waking up at the ass crack
of dawn to be Soto's secretary.

28:20.829 --> 28:23.440
The hits keep coming.

28:23.484 --> 28:26.139
That was a show
of confidence, man.

28:26.182 --> 28:28.968
Look, Soto's been on you
to step up since he got here.

28:29.011 --> 28:31.187
This might be an opportunity
for you to prove to yourself

28:31.231 --> 28:33.233
that you're more
than just a knuckle-dragger.

28:36.062 --> 28:37.716
Fire Team,

28:37.759 --> 28:39.718
report to training exercises
in seven minutes.

28:41.415 --> 28:43.765
Everyone welcome back
Chief Petty Officer Mina Hassan.

28:43.809 --> 28:45.288
Good to see you all again.

28:45.332 --> 28:46.899
-We haven't got
our sea legs yet,

28:46.942 --> 28:48.378
and you're already
kicking the hornet's nest?

28:48.422 --> 28:49.945
Yeah, well, there's really
no time to waste,

28:49.989 --> 28:51.468
given the imminent
defection of this man,

28:51.512 --> 28:53.079
Oruku Atanga.

28:53.122 --> 28:55.559
Atanga is a high-ranking
Boko Haram lieutenant

28:55.603 --> 28:58.127
who has grown disillusioned and
wants to help end the violence.

28:58.171 --> 28:59.781
He's already been vetted,
and is currently

28:59.825 --> 29:01.043
in communication
with the Agency.

29:01.087 --> 29:02.784
That communication's
being facilitated

29:02.828 --> 29:05.221
by a local Cameroonian
warlord, Idogbe Moussa.

29:05.265 --> 29:07.441
Moussa has a checkered history
in the region,

29:07.484 --> 29:10.009
but he's been fighting
Boko Haram for the last decade.

29:10.052 --> 29:12.185
-The enemy of my enemy.
Exactly. Which is why

29:12.228 --> 29:14.187
our first operation
will be assisting him.

29:14.230 --> 29:16.798
-Manaka, a village under
Moussa's protection,

29:16.842 --> 29:18.974
is being starved out by Boko.

29:19.018 --> 29:20.628
The past two attempts
to deliver food

29:20.671 --> 29:22.195
and medical supplies
have been waylaid.

29:22.238 --> 29:24.371
Moussa's men were killed
and the food stolen.

29:24.414 --> 29:27.766
So, Bravo will accompany Moussa
on the third convoy as PSD.

29:27.809 --> 29:29.158
Once we arrive in Manaka,

29:29.202 --> 29:31.334
Moussa will deliver Atanga
and his wealth of intel.

29:31.378 --> 29:33.946
But first, we got to play
-Grubhub drivers for him?
-Favor op.

29:33.989 --> 29:35.512
Teams did it for the warlords

29:35.556 --> 29:38.515
-early on in Afghanistan.
-Same rodeo, different clowns.

29:38.559 --> 29:40.300
Op's tougher
than it sounds, too.

29:40.343 --> 29:41.780
The convoy will leave from here,

29:41.823 --> 29:43.825
just outside Kwala Ambassa.
That route's gonna take us

29:43.869 --> 29:45.392
from the foothills
into the mountains.

29:45.435 --> 29:47.002
We'll be rolling in Agency SUVs.

29:47.046 --> 29:49.483
Yeah, it's high elevation gains,
you're gonna be hitting a lot

29:49.526 --> 29:51.528
of chokepoints
-to get to Manaka.
Convoy better

29:51.572 --> 29:53.400
-have some serious horsepower.
-Yeah.

29:53.443 --> 29:55.794
-Currently, the region's
considered semi-permissive.

29:55.837 --> 29:57.273
State Department would like
to keep it that way

29:57.317 --> 29:58.622
as long as possible.

29:58.666 --> 30:00.886
We need to keep
things tight.
We?

30:00.929 --> 30:02.713
I'll be rolling with Bravo
on this one, Master Chief.

30:02.757 --> 30:04.324
That an issue?

30:05.238 --> 30:06.979
More the merrier.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.870
Welcome to Kwala Ambassa.

30:28.914 --> 30:31.351
I hope you came
ready for a fight.

30:33.092 --> 30:35.572
Master Chief Hayes.
This here's Lieutenant Soto.

30:35.616 --> 30:37.400
-We're here to help.
-Help we can use.

30:37.444 --> 30:39.881
They're almost finished
loading the truck.

30:39.925 --> 30:42.318
-That truck there?
-Yes.

30:42.362 --> 30:43.885
Our last remaining vehicle.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.931
These guys got
to be joking, right?

30:45.974 --> 30:47.802
Oh, come on, Sonny.
We've seen worse.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.021
Yeah, but you ever driven worse?

30:49.064 --> 30:50.587
Hey, this heap of junk
right here

30:50.631 --> 30:51.762
isn't gonna outrun anybody.

30:51.806 --> 30:53.025
We definitely
need protection,

30:53.068 --> 30:54.417
-so let's up-armor it.
-Look, more weight

30:54.461 --> 30:55.897
we add to this, the
slower we're gonna go.

30:55.941 --> 30:57.159
We're gonna be
damn sitting ducks.

30:57.203 --> 30:58.726
Without protection,
we'll be roadkill.

30:58.769 --> 31:00.075
Speed or security, Master Chief?

31:00.119 --> 31:01.598
Saw what happened
with the last two convoys,

31:01.642 --> 31:04.210
so, let's up-armor it.

31:04.253 --> 31:06.777
Here at driver's side.
Cover the wheels. Let's go.

31:06.821 --> 31:08.170
Copy that.

31:08.214 --> 31:11.086
<i>Drone feed still isn't live?</i>

31:11.130 --> 31:12.609
-No.
-Did you update
the freqs yet?

31:12.653 --> 31:14.916
Yes, we did.

31:19.312 --> 31:22.619
Alex? Davis.

31:22.663 --> 31:23.925
Guam, 2014.

31:23.969 --> 31:27.015
Davis. Yeah, of course.

31:27.059 --> 31:28.364
I didn't place your face
with that rank.

31:28.408 --> 31:30.497
Congratulations.
Must be doing something right.

31:30.540 --> 31:31.846
You, too, Lieutenant Commander.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.543
So, you're running comms
for the <i>Keating?</i>

31:33.587 --> 31:35.241
Well, it sounds
better than it is.

31:35.284 --> 31:37.852
Let's see if we can figure out
-this encryption.
-Yeah.

31:46.992 --> 31:48.907
Havoc, this is 1.
We're ready to roll.

31:48.950 --> 31:50.212
How's our route look?

31:50.256 --> 31:51.779
The drone is overhead, 1,

31:51.822 --> 31:53.694
but we're not receiving
the feed.

31:54.564 --> 31:55.870
How long is that gonna take?

31:55.914 --> 31:57.089
We're working the problem.

31:57.132 --> 31:58.829
I'll let you know
when we've got it.

31:58.873 --> 32:01.180
Gonna be on our own till
they get that link up, Jace.

32:01.223 --> 32:03.530
And we need every tactical
advantage we can get.

32:03.573 --> 32:05.749
We better get rolling.

32:05.793 --> 32:08.752
-Come on.
-Coming.

32:31.210 --> 32:33.995
Glad you made things right
at home before we left.

32:34.039 --> 32:36.432
Same here, brother.

32:39.870 --> 32:42.264
Yeah, Stella will be relieved.

32:43.439 --> 32:45.528
Approaching the first chokepoint.

32:45.572 --> 32:47.008
Keep your eyes open.

33:11.946 --> 33:14.166
Clearing the chokepoint.

33:28.267 --> 33:30.443
Bravo 1, this is 3.

33:30.486 --> 33:33.098
Got some lookie-loos back here
giving us the stink eye.

33:34.273 --> 33:36.710
Copy that.
Does he seem aggressive to you?

33:36.753 --> 33:39.147
Not sure if they're running late
or probing us.

33:39.191 --> 33:41.410
We take him out now,
we won't get hit later.

33:41.454 --> 33:43.151
Bravo 2,

33:43.195 --> 33:46.067
they're coming up
on your right side.

33:48.504 --> 33:51.116
Could be wrong place,
wrong time.

33:51.159 --> 33:52.900
Or it could be Boko probing
our convoy.

33:52.943 --> 33:55.120
He's falling back.

34:02.562 --> 34:04.781
Havoc, this is 1.
You got the ISR link up?

34:04.825 --> 34:06.392
Negative, 1. Working on it.

34:06.435 --> 34:07.871
He's about one foot away

34:07.915 --> 34:09.482
from playing
real-life bumper cars.

34:09.525 --> 34:11.614
Want me to let a little air
out of his engine block?

34:11.658 --> 34:14.182
This follows the pattern
of their previous attacks.

34:14.226 --> 34:16.271
We take 'em out now,
they won't hit us later.

34:16.315 --> 34:18.578
Maybe we should find out
if he's armed first.

34:20.362 --> 34:21.189
3...

34:21.233 --> 34:22.756
does this guy have a weapon?

34:22.799 --> 34:24.584
Other than the truck
he's trying to drive up my lap,

34:24.627 --> 34:27.065
that's a negative--
-I don't see any.
Roger that.

34:27.108 --> 34:28.327
Take a warning shot.

34:28.370 --> 34:29.545
Roger that.

34:29.589 --> 34:31.330
Kick rocks, nerd.

34:35.247 --> 34:36.378
Hooah!

34:36.422 --> 34:39.512
Bravo 1, this is 3.
He has backed off.

34:41.122 --> 34:43.081
1, this is Havoc Base.
We've got eyes on you now,

34:43.124 --> 34:44.647
and you've got company.

34:44.691 --> 34:46.693
There are three vehicles moving
to intercept your course.

34:46.736 --> 34:49.435
One of them appears to be
-a technical.
-So much for warning shots.

35:08.018 --> 35:10.760
If we don't get through first,
they're gonna box us in.

35:10.804 --> 35:12.153
Everybody floor it.

35:42.096 --> 35:43.271
Metal!

35:47.232 --> 35:48.363
Cargo truck's too slow.

35:48.407 --> 35:50.365
They're gonna try
and get around us.

35:53.977 --> 35:55.501
Come on!

35:55.544 --> 35:58.025
Hey, Jace, we can't
hold up like this much longer.

35:58.068 --> 36:00.984
Give me a bag--
stuff it with two HC smokes.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.557
Well, they're gonna have
a lot of lead in their boots.

36:23.485 --> 36:25.792
J-hook left.

36:26.619 --> 36:28.186
Speed up and shift left.

36:28.229 --> 36:29.535
Shift left, shift left.

36:41.024 --> 36:43.201
<i>They're blind.</i>

36:43.244 --> 36:44.767
J-hook now.

37:28.681 --> 37:30.160
Havoc, this is 1.

37:30.204 --> 37:32.859
Enemy vehicle's bugging out.
We're Charlie Mike.

37:32.902 --> 37:35.165
Strong copy, Bravo 1.

37:40.954 --> 37:43.348
Hey, you have helped
my people.

37:43.391 --> 37:45.045
That food
will feed many.

37:45.088 --> 37:46.351
Thank you.

37:46.394 --> 37:48.048
Just kept our end of the deal.

37:48.091 --> 37:50.268
And I will keep mine.

37:54.446 --> 37:58.406
-As always, it
was a pleasure.

37:58.450 --> 38:00.495
Ah. Likewise.

38:01.583 --> 38:02.715
You know...

38:02.758 --> 38:04.717
got to say, after Irbid,

38:04.760 --> 38:07.633
didn't think you'd still
be tagging along with Bravo.

38:07.676 --> 38:08.895
Life got in the way.

38:08.938 --> 38:10.244
That's too bad.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.507
You sounded like
you were ready to move on.

38:12.551 --> 38:15.423
Well, I've got
-some feelers out.
-Let me know

38:15.467 --> 38:17.077
if there's anything I can do.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.297
I will. Thank you.

38:20.472 --> 38:22.822
Hey, I've been meaning
to ask you, um...

38:22.865 --> 38:25.955
what's it been like working
with Comms Officer Whitshaw?

38:25.999 --> 38:27.087
Alex?

38:27.130 --> 38:29.916
He's... capable,
knows his stuff.

38:29.959 --> 38:32.005
Seems like a good guy.

38:32.048 --> 38:33.615
Good.

38:37.880 --> 38:40.709
Did you see my boy Ray hanging
out the frickin' car there?

38:40.753 --> 38:42.494
Going full <i>Fast & Furious.</i>

38:42.537 --> 38:44.278
Dude!
And looked good doing it.

38:44.322 --> 38:45.758
Oh, yeah, baby.

38:45.801 --> 38:47.107
-Hey.
-Got to admit,

38:47.150 --> 38:48.500
that smoke screen
was so off-book,

38:48.543 --> 38:50.284
I probably never would
have thought of it.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.286
Sometimes it's good to throw
the book out the window, huh?

38:52.330 --> 38:53.635
We all have
our blind spots.

38:53.679 --> 38:55.115
Happy to be shown
my own today.

38:55.158 --> 38:57.073
Only way to improve.

38:58.553 --> 39:01.774
Well, playing road warrior's
got me worn out, boys.

39:01.817 --> 39:03.297
I'll see you in the morning.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.865
Oh, your own bunk.
Living the good life there, huh?

39:05.908 --> 39:08.171
Jealousy's a sin,
Sonny Quinn.

39:08.215 --> 39:09.608
Come on, Ray.

39:09.651 --> 39:11.392
Tell us what it's like to
be able to sit up in bed.

39:11.436 --> 39:13.873
Gonna be the best night's sleep
you got in a minute.

39:13.916 --> 39:16.789
Yeah, right.

39:16.832 --> 39:19.313
What's that all about
with Ray and his sleeping?

39:19.357 --> 39:22.490
Well, I mean, ship's
a step up from the cages.

39:24.492 --> 39:27.190
You know, 'cause of whatever
he was dealing with at home.

39:29.018 --> 39:30.542
Yeah, right.

39:38.593 --> 39:41.074
Hey. Hey, can you hear me?

39:41.117 --> 39:42.684
I can hear you.

39:42.728 --> 39:46.819
Hey, hey, sorry I-I haven't
checked in in a couple days.

39:46.862 --> 39:48.124
H-How, uh...

39:48.168 --> 39:49.865
how you feeling?

39:49.909 --> 39:50.997
Good.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.826
The baby's been kicking all day.

39:53.869 --> 39:55.262
Oh, yeah?

39:55.305 --> 39:57.307
Yeah. So, where are you?

39:57.351 --> 39:59.832
I'm in the middle of the ocean.

39:59.875 --> 40:02.356
Baby shower scare you more
than shark-infested waters?

40:02.400 --> 40:04.706
Yeah, I'm not ghosting you.
I swear.

40:04.750 --> 40:08.580
We just...
ripped out unexpectedly and, uh,

40:08.623 --> 40:11.365
well, I'm gonna be here
for the next two months.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.498
So the shower's out.

40:13.541 --> 40:15.021
Yeah, and...

40:15.064 --> 40:16.805
and the delivery.

40:16.849 --> 40:20.896
I wasn't really sure you and
Lisa wanted to be here for that.

40:20.940 --> 40:22.768
I was hoping to meet her

40:22.811 --> 40:24.726
before the baby arrived.

40:26.162 --> 40:29.122
Yeah, uh, about that, um...

40:29.165 --> 40:32.560
me and, uh, Lisa,
we ended up, uh...

40:32.604 --> 40:35.737
well, we... we finished things.

40:36.738 --> 40:38.784
Oh, Sonny, I'm sorry.

40:39.611 --> 40:43.571
Look, I-I know I had
much more appeal as a parent

40:43.615 --> 40:47.706
with, um, a responsible
Miss Lisa by my side,

40:47.749 --> 40:50.186
but, um...

40:50.230 --> 40:52.580
you know, I'm...

40:52.624 --> 40:54.930
I'm fixin' to give this
a go solo,

40:54.974 --> 40:57.193
if, uh, you're okay with that.

40:57.237 --> 40:59.674
Of course I'm okay with that.

41:00.806 --> 41:04.462
You are gonna make a great
father to our little girl.

41:11.512 --> 41:13.079
So...

41:13.122 --> 41:15.560
Wow, it's... it's a girl?

41:15.603 --> 41:17.562
