00:40.123 --> 00:42.084
<i>Dubai Delivery, this is Kingdom 2-9.</i>

00:42.084 --> 00:44.127
<i>Request clearance to London Heathrow.</i>

00:53.345 --> 00:54.847
Excuse me. Sorry.

00:59.810 --> 01:00.644
<i>Sorry.</i>

01:01.770 --> 01:03.146
Excuse me. Sorry.

01:03.146 --> 01:06.066
- Stop. Stop. Wha--
- I've had a talk with check-in.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.360
They said, "When you get to security,
they'll let you straight through."

01:08.360 --> 01:11.446
Yes, please. You come.

01:12.614 --> 01:14.032
<i>Kingdom 2-9, good morning.</i>

01:14.032 --> 01:18.620
<i>You have a Gulf Air flight ahead of you,
then you are next on the runway 3-0 right.</i>

01:18.620 --> 01:20.789
You sound in good spirits today, Dubai.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.749
It's my birthday today, Kingdom 2-9.

01:22.749 --> 01:25.294
- <i>Well, happy birthday.</i>
- <i>Happy birthday, Dubai.</i>

01:26.253 --> 01:29.214
If you wanna treat
yourself, try the restaurant at the Plaza.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.426
Yeah, sure. If you wanna
spend your birthday going bankrupt.

01:32.426 --> 01:35.220
I'm serious, Dubai.
Half a lobster for one.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.181
You'll thank me, next time.

01:47.691 --> 01:50.527
Well, a very good morning, everyone.
This is Captain Robin Allen speaking.

01:50.527 --> 01:53.739
On behalf of myself and my first officer,
Anna Kovacs,

01:53.739 --> 01:55.282
- I'd like to welcome you onboard...
- Okay?

01:55.282 --> 01:59.286
...this Kingdom Airlines flight
to London Heathrow.

01:59.286 --> 02:04.041
<i>Cabin crew today is headed by
the very capable Deevia Khan.</i>

02:05.125 --> 02:07.002
<i>Deevia and her excellent crew
will be on hand</i>

02:07.002 --> 02:09.922
- <i>for all your questions and concerns.</i>
- Sir, can you sit up, please?

02:09.922 --> 02:12.299
- <i>Flight time today is six hours...</i>
- Good morning, sir.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.383
<i>...54 minutes.</i>

02:13.383 --> 02:15.719
- I think we're down here.
- All right, this side here?

02:15.719 --> 02:17.846
<i>Due to arrive
at London Heathrow round about</i>

02:17.846 --> 02:20.641
<i>six minutes past 1:00
in the afternoon, local time.</i>

02:20.641 --> 02:22.601
<i>Weather en route's calm, clear skies</i>

02:22.601 --> 02:24.561
<i>most of the way, including in the UK.</i>

02:24.561 --> 02:29.274
<i>Ground temperature at Heathrow right now
is a mighty seven degrees.</i>

02:29.274 --> 02:31.026
- <i>Just a couple minutes delay...</i>
- Don't say anything.

02:31.026 --> 02:33.195
<i>...while the final few passengers
make their way onboard.</i>

02:33.195 --> 02:34.780
- <i>We should be pushing back...</i>
- Philip!

02:34.780 --> 02:36.907
- See what I can do.
- <i>...any minute now.</i>

02:36.907 --> 02:38.909
You okay, love? Do you want a pill?

02:39.868 --> 02:40.702
No.

02:41.537 --> 02:42.538
Okay.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.425
Sorry, love.
I'm old-fashioned. Can't help it.

03:05.978 --> 03:07.521
<i>Any remaining passengers</i>

03:07.521 --> 03:10.482
- <i>for flight KA29 to London Heathrow.</i>
- Sorry.

03:10.482 --> 03:13.277
<i>Please make their way to Gate B15.</i>

03:13.277 --> 03:15.445
- Thank you.
- <i>That's any remaining passengers...</i>

03:15.445 --> 03:17.030
Quick as you can, please, sir.

03:17.823 --> 03:19.074
- Right.
- Thank you.

03:20.659 --> 03:22.411
That's great. No hand luggage today?

03:22.411 --> 03:25.497
- No. Just this for my wife.
- Okay. Great.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.916
No, wait! Wait! Wait, please.

03:27.916 --> 03:31.336
No, wait. No, no.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.589
- Sir, the gate is now closed.
- Please.

03:33.589 --> 03:34.965
Sir, I'm sorry.

03:34.965 --> 03:37.801
It's already onboard.
My luggage is already onboard.

03:37.801 --> 03:40.012
- Sir, I'm sorry.
- Please.

03:40.012 --> 03:42.806
Miss, how bad can it be?

03:48.228 --> 03:49.605
Okay.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.149
- Thank you.
- Okay.

03:53.609 --> 03:54.610
Let's go.

03:56.862 --> 03:59.239
Stop! Just stop.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.451
Look, there's a space.
There, David. That's ours.

04:03.535 --> 04:05.370
Stop! You're doing my head in!

04:05.370 --> 04:06.455
You don't get one.

04:07.122 --> 04:08.248
Sorry, love?

04:08.248 --> 04:10.709
The lockers,
it's not like they're allocated.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.377
They all belong to all of us.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.129
We're entitled to 'em
as much as anybody else is.

04:14.129 --> 04:15.839
No, yeah, I know. I'm just saying--

04:15.839 --> 04:17.423
And there's four of us.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.010
It's not just us and our fruity water.

04:20.511 --> 04:23.597
- We've got kids.
- I'm going to tell Mom.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.265
- I hadn't noticed.
- Enough.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.310
Sir, if you'll let me.
There's some space further up the plane.

04:29.353 --> 04:30.437
Thank you.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.654
Right. Just do that.

04:40.197 --> 04:43.367
<i>Well, folks. I'm told we're just
boarding our final few passengers,</i>

04:43.367 --> 04:45.035
<i>and then we'll be on our way.</i>

04:45.536 --> 04:46.912
Morning. Morning.

04:46.912 --> 04:49.748
<i>I'll get back to you a little later
during the flight with any updates.</i>

04:49.748 --> 04:51.959
<i>In the meantime, I will leave you
with Deevia and the team,</i>

04:51.959 --> 04:55.420
and we wish you
a safe and pleasant flight.

04:58.632 --> 04:59.633
Sorry.

05:01.844 --> 05:04.513
- Morning.
- Hi, there. Yeah, just under there.

05:04.513 --> 05:07.599
Hello. Right, just here, on this side.

05:17.484 --> 05:20.320
Hey, by the way, weren't you meant
to be flying transatlantic?

05:20.320 --> 05:21.905
Wanted to be with my boyfriend.

05:21.905 --> 05:24.700
Is that what they call
sugar daddies these days?

05:24.700 --> 05:25.826
How's your love life, Arthur?

05:25.826 --> 05:28.036
Still drowning in offers,
or have things finally settled down?

05:28.036 --> 05:30.455
- Here. There's room in first.
- Ouch. Okay.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.958
Sir, we're about to push back.

05:32.958 --> 05:35.544
I'm sorry,
but my wife's a rather anxious flier.

05:36.211 --> 05:39.214
We couldn't help notice
a pair of empty seats in business class.

05:39.715 --> 05:42.759
Sir, take it from me,
that's not gonna get you anywhere. Okay?

05:43.260 --> 05:44.636
Back to your seat, please.

05:50.642 --> 05:52.102
I did. Just.

05:52.603 --> 05:54.313
- Right there, sir.
- Thanks.

05:59.151 --> 06:02.029
Make the trade. Yeah. I've got to go.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.335
For a lucky lady?

06:16.335 --> 06:18.754
The other way around. From a lucky man.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.215
- Let me.
- Thank you.

06:33.352 --> 06:36.230
Cabin crew, doors to automatic
and cross-check, thank you.

06:49.493 --> 06:53.247
Kingdom 2-9, you're clear for departure
on runway 3-0 right.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.249
<i>Thank you, Dubai. Enjoy your special day.</i>

06:55.249 --> 06:56.917
<i>Don't do anything I wouldn't do.</i>

06:56.917 --> 06:58.335
What does that leave, exactly?

07:00.087 --> 07:01.755
More than a man should admit.

07:02.297 --> 07:03.799
<i>Safe journey now.</i>

07:20.482 --> 07:22.067
<i>In the unlikely event</i>

07:22.067 --> 07:24.528
<i>of the aircraft having to make
an emergency landing,</i>

07:24.528 --> 07:26.989
<i>you'll be told
to adopt the brace position.</i>

07:28.198 --> 07:30.367
<i>If we need to evacuate the aircraft,</i>

07:30.367 --> 07:33.328
<i>please follow the emergency lighting
to your nearest exit,</i>

07:33.328 --> 07:35.038
<i>taking nothing with you.</i>

07:35.622 --> 07:38.333
<i>Your cabin crew
will now point out your nearest exits.</i>

07:39.376 --> 07:40.544
<i>Slides will deploy</i>

07:40.544 --> 07:42.629
<i>from these emergency exits.</i>

07:43.380 --> 07:45.340
<i>If the aircraft lands on water,</i>

07:45.340 --> 07:48.677
<i>life jackets are beside
or underneath your seat.</i>

07:48.677 --> 07:52.222
<i>Place them over your head,
and tie them securely, like so.</i>

07:53.015 --> 07:56.310
<i>These should not be inflated
until you exit the aircraft.</i>

07:56.810 --> 08:00.981
<i>During the flight, all devices
should remain in flight-safe mode.</i>

08:00.981 --> 08:01.899
Hey.

08:01.899 --> 08:03.275
<i>During takeoff and landing...</i>

08:03.275 --> 08:04.359
Hey.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.196
Can you turn that down?

08:09.448 --> 08:10.532
Please.

08:10.532 --> 08:12.701
<i>Your luggage should be stowed
in the overhead lockers</i>

08:12.701 --> 08:14.369
<i>or under the seat in front.</i>

08:14.369 --> 08:16.455
<i>Now, please. Sit back,
switch off and stow...</i>

08:16.455 --> 08:17.539
Thanks.

08:17.539 --> 08:22.169
<i>...your electronic devices and prepare for
a relaxing flight with Kingdom Airlines.</i>

08:24.213 --> 08:26.590
Cabin crew,
please take your seats for takeoff.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.041
<i>Stabilize. V1.</i>

10:29.087 --> 10:30.797
This is us. Look.

10:31.465 --> 10:35.302
We go all the way up here,
right over Europe.

10:36.011 --> 10:38.263
This thing shaped like a boot is...

10:38.847 --> 10:42.017
I-- It-- It's Italy.

10:42.601 --> 10:46.563
Then we carry on across this bit,
and where's that, Fred?

10:47.147 --> 10:48.524
Can I play Mario Kart now?

10:48.524 --> 10:49.733
That's home!

10:50.275 --> 10:53.153
Seven hours all that way,
that's all it takes.

10:56.782 --> 10:57.991
Yeah, in a bit.

11:05.707 --> 11:09.336
Do you know the internationally accepted
code for caffeine?

11:13.507 --> 11:15.509
Once for seat belts, twice for coffee.

11:23.725 --> 11:24.852
How does he take it?

11:25.894 --> 11:27.020
Why are you asking me?

11:35.279 --> 11:37.906
- Like I said, I'm old-fashioned like that.
- Thanks.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.537
When do they come round
with the champagne?

11:49.168 --> 11:50.627
We got off on the wrong foot.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.673
Hugo. Marketing.

11:54.673 --> 11:57.885
UK start-ups in the UAE,
it's actually a very interesting area.

12:00.012 --> 12:01.013
What about you?

12:02.139 --> 12:06.310
Let me guess. Banker. No, properties.

12:07.477 --> 12:08.478
Sport, maybe?

12:09.229 --> 12:11.648
One of those agents who makes
a disgusting amount of cash.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.108
Enjoy the movie.

12:14.109 --> 12:15.110
Movie?

12:15.110 --> 12:18.947
Or whatever it is you're gonna do
that doesn't involve speaking to me.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.201
Okay.

12:25.287 --> 12:26.288
Fine.

12:56.985 --> 12:57.986
Flight deck.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.072
<i>Hey, it's Arthur. Got your coffee.</i>

13:00.072 --> 13:01.156
Thanks.

13:10.916 --> 13:11.917
Hey, guys.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.773
Listen to R & B I suppose, but...

13:38.569 --> 13:39.736
What?

13:45.492 --> 13:46.827
Is that...

13:47.953 --> 13:48.829
I don't know.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.585
You all right, darling?

13:57.963 --> 13:59.423
I found something.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.052
Is it real?

14:04.887 --> 14:06.305
You're asking the wrong man.

14:08.390 --> 14:09.391
What do I do?

14:11.518 --> 14:14.813
Okay, I'll go tell someone.

14:14.813 --> 14:17.649
Somebody in the crew, they'll have
a whatsit, a thing they do.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.235
- A procedure.
- That's right.

14:20.235 --> 14:21.570
Want me to come with you?

14:22.237 --> 14:23.572
- Do you want to?
- I can come.

14:26.450 --> 14:27.701
Maybe we should wait.

14:28.493 --> 14:29.786
Keep it low-key, yeah?

14:30.829 --> 14:31.997
What's your name, darling?

14:32.956 --> 14:35.417
- Naomi.
- I'm Marcus.

14:36.543 --> 14:37.836
You stay there, Naomi.

14:37.836 --> 14:39.963
I'll be straight back,
tell you what they said.

14:59.900 --> 15:03.153
<i>Morning, ladies and gentlemen.
We have now reached our cruising altitude.</i>

15:03.153 --> 15:05.781
<i>Our in-flight refreshment service
will commence shortly with drinks,</i>

15:05.781 --> 15:09.368
<i>followed later in the flight by lunch,
prior to our landing in London.</i>

15:09.952 --> 15:11.036
Everything okay, sir?

15:13.747 --> 15:15.332
I need a very quick word, please.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.045
A very quick word with my nephew.

15:20.879 --> 15:22.840
Sorry,
you're not actually allowed in first.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.299
One minute and I'll be gone.

15:26.343 --> 15:27.344
Thank you, darling.

15:28.345 --> 15:30.097
Sir, wait. You're not allowed in...

15:30.973 --> 15:31.974
Sir.

15:35.352 --> 15:36.436
Problem.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.902
One of our lot left a round in the toilet,
and some girl found it.

15:47.698 --> 15:49.032
We bring it forward.

15:50.492 --> 15:51.618
That's my call.

15:51.618 --> 15:56.164
Yeah. That's why I'm here,
to advise you to make the call.

15:56.748 --> 15:58.375
The plan was three hours.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.252
Plan's gone to shit.

16:01.044 --> 16:03.380
They think I'm up here
reporting it to the staff.

16:03.881 --> 16:04.882
Cabin crew.

16:08.302 --> 16:12.347
Right. Well, go back
and you tell them you reported it.

16:13.056 --> 16:15.392
And you tell them they said
it wasn't a problem.

16:15.392 --> 16:16.768
How's that not a problem?

16:17.769 --> 16:21.356
Because, Terry, it belonged to someone
who's allowed to have it.

16:22.024 --> 16:24.026
Like a soldier or something like that.

16:25.527 --> 16:26.820
And if they don't buy it?

16:33.660 --> 16:35.162
That's the five-minute warning.

16:36.705 --> 16:40.501
Go out the back wearing that and make sure
every one of our lot sees you.

16:42.002 --> 16:45.214
And whatever you tell the girls,
it's only gotta hold for five minutes.

16:46.632 --> 16:48.842
We go on Jamie's call like we practiced.

16:59.645 --> 17:01.396
- Thank you, darling.
- No problem.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.426
Long story short, we're okay.

17:32.302 --> 17:35.514
Turns out there was some sort of
routine security check before takeoff.

17:35.514 --> 17:37.099
Happens about once a week, apparently.

17:37.099 --> 17:39.685
And one who was on board,
one of the Dubai security boys,

17:39.685 --> 17:41.144
asked to use the toilet.

17:41.144 --> 17:43.146
- And that's how it got there?
- Yeah.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.316
They're all armed, see.
Foreign police. It's not like London.

17:46.316 --> 17:47.901
So they weren't worried?

17:48.402 --> 17:51.572
Didn't seem to be.
Not like the four of us, hey?

17:52.155 --> 17:54.241
I told them that and all.
I said we'd had a moment.

17:56.827 --> 18:03.208
One thing she did ask more seriously
was for us not to repeat any of this

18:03.208 --> 18:04.668
in case it causes any...

18:04.668 --> 18:07.045
Concern. No, of course.

18:08.714 --> 18:11.675
So, wait, some guy gets on the plane.

18:11.675 --> 18:13.969
He's got some sort of gun.

18:15.429 --> 18:17.723
He goes to the toilet,
and that's how it got there?

18:18.473 --> 18:20.684
It just fell out?
That's what you're saying?

18:20.684 --> 18:23.270
- No, darling, that's what they're saying.
- Mona.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.188
I don't get it.

18:26.398 --> 18:30.903
Listen, I went up there, I told them.
That's what they told me.

18:31.612 --> 18:33.280
And they didn't seem worried.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.282
- But--
- That's the point.

18:37.743 --> 18:40.120
That's the important thing.

18:42.539 --> 18:44.833
Thank you, Marcus. Honestly.

18:50.839 --> 18:52.090
- You all right?
- Yeah.

19:17.616 --> 19:18.909
Why would they lie?

19:18.909 --> 19:20.244
That's not what I'm saying.

19:22.371 --> 19:23.789
I just want them to explain.

19:24.748 --> 19:26.458
No. No, Mona.

19:27.042 --> 19:30.212
Think about it. You can't
just bring bullets on to a plane.

19:32.256 --> 19:33.382
Next, please.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.313
Senil?

19:49.064 --> 19:51.024
<i>They want you to come home.</i>

19:51.817 --> 19:55.487
<i>Tell your boss you're not feeling well
and come home right now.</i>

19:56.280 --> 19:57.155
What for?

19:57.155 --> 19:58.407
<i>Gala!</i>

19:58.407 --> 19:59.491
What for Senil?

20:20.721 --> 20:22.931
He is allowed to play.

20:22.931 --> 20:26.143
- Did I say anything?
- Just like she's allowed to watch a film

20:26.143 --> 20:28.854
- and him and all of those other--
- Yeah. They're on headphones.

20:28.854 --> 20:30.147
He would be on his headphones,

20:30.147 --> 20:32.858
but the headphones that fits his game
are in his suitcase.

20:32.858 --> 20:35.777
There was no room for that, remember?
Because of all your bags.

20:35.777 --> 20:37.571
- All my bags?
- Yeah, you went shopping.

20:37.571 --> 20:38.989
One thing.

20:38.989 --> 20:40.991
Which you put in our locker.

20:42.242 --> 20:44.620
You know what, I'm not saying anything.
I'm not having this conversation.

20:44.620 --> 20:46.622
You started the conversation, love.

20:46.622 --> 20:49.249
- No, I'm saying nothing.
- Yeah, you don't sound like it.

20:51.502 --> 20:52.878
What are you doing?

21:36.672 --> 21:37.673
Hi.

21:37.673 --> 21:39.466
You know how you said that
that thing in the toilets

21:39.466 --> 21:40.801
was nothing to worry about, yeah?

21:42.052 --> 21:43.053
Excuse me?

21:44.012 --> 21:45.722
The object in the toilet.

21:46.557 --> 21:47.891
The item.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.061
- Item?
- It might not have been him that he told.

21:51.061 --> 21:53.272
And you said
there was nothing to worry about?

22:09.204 --> 22:10.747
Start from the beginning for me.

22:10.747 --> 22:13.584
Nice and slow, okay?
What was the item that you found?

22:14.418 --> 22:15.711
You want me to say it?

22:17.421 --> 22:20.007
- It might help.
- You want me to say it out loud?

22:20.632 --> 22:22.217
Unless you wanna draw me a picture. Yeah.

22:22.217 --> 22:23.385
Wow.

22:27.222 --> 22:28.599
How can I help, sir?

22:28.599 --> 22:31.393
Sorry, yeah, I didn't get a washbag.

22:31.393 --> 22:34.396
Well, you don't get a washbag.
Only on the overnight flights.

22:34.396 --> 22:37.482
- So no one's got a washbag?
- No.

22:40.194 --> 22:41.195
Thanks.

22:46.200 --> 22:47.201
Sir?

22:53.248 --> 22:54.708
He said not to do this.

22:54.708 --> 22:56.627
She's just thinking about
health and safety.

22:56.627 --> 22:57.961
Look, what did you find?

22:57.961 --> 23:00.797
Look, madam, if you think it's important,
you need to tell me what it is.

23:00.797 --> 23:02.090
Don't.

23:02.674 --> 23:06.053
Thing is,
we don't want people to, you know...

23:06.053 --> 23:08.597
- What?
- Panic.

23:28.242 --> 23:29.701
Everybody down!

23:30.911 --> 23:32.746
Down! Down!

23:33.330 --> 23:35.624
- Remain in your seats!
- You! Down!

23:35.624 --> 23:38.210
Get down! All of you! Get down now!

23:41.338 --> 23:42.506
Do not move!

23:43.257 --> 23:45.050
Sit the fuck down!

23:45.050 --> 23:46.844
Stay in your fucking seats!

23:46.844 --> 23:48.136
Oh, geez.

23:48.762 --> 23:51.056
- Do not move!
- Stay the fuck down!

23:51.056 --> 23:52.349
Don't be fucking stupid!

23:52.349 --> 23:53.392
Please!

23:56.436 --> 23:59.064
Stay calm! Sit down. Face the front.

24:01.024 --> 24:03.026
No, you fucking don't.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.780
Everyone stay calm,
and no one gets hurt, okay?

24:22.504 --> 24:23.505
Morning.

24:27.885 --> 24:29.469
Kai, do you want some milk?

24:39.354 --> 24:40.355
Morning.

24:49.198 --> 24:50.199
Wow.

24:50.699 --> 24:55.204
So Detective Daniel gets
to sleep over now.

24:55.204 --> 24:56.455
You don't call him that, Kai.

24:56.455 --> 24:59.583
So, what are we? Are we all flatmates now?

24:59.583 --> 25:00.876
We spoke about this.

25:01.793 --> 25:03.545
It's okay. I get it.

25:04.922 --> 25:06.215
Great bike, by the way.

25:07.216 --> 25:10.594
Thanks. I decided to get one
that's fixed onto the floor.

25:11.637 --> 25:12.471
Go on.

25:12.471 --> 25:15.307
So that you and your mates
can't pull me over for no reason.

25:16.016 --> 25:17.643
That's a good joke. I like it.

25:18.143 --> 25:19.228
- No joke.
- Kai.

25:19.228 --> 25:20.771
And you don't like it.

25:27.778 --> 25:32.199
Everybody, listen!
This is how it's gonna work.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.619
Nobody makes any noise.

25:37.329 --> 25:38.914
Nobody makes any trouble.

25:40.874 --> 25:45.838
And nobody gets seriously fucking injured.

25:47.923 --> 25:50.551
Did you hear that? That's Arabic.

25:50.551 --> 25:55.055
- She's speaking English.
- She is. She's English.

25:56.306 --> 25:59.184
But someone is speaking Arabic.

25:59.810 --> 26:06.191
Phones, tablets, devices. The Wi-Fi's off.
There's no need to be a hero.

26:11.822 --> 26:13.824
Hey, what's your name?

26:14.449 --> 26:16.410
- Amanda. Yeah.
- Amanda?

26:16.410 --> 26:18.579
Amanda, just breathe, all right? I'm Sam.

26:19.496 --> 26:21.665
- Listen to me. Drink that.
- Okay.

26:23.709 --> 26:25.210
Look, you're like me, yeah?

26:25.210 --> 26:27.171
Got family? Loved ones?

26:29.131 --> 26:30.465
We got one job to do right now.

26:30.465 --> 26:33.260
- Just get through it for them. All right?
- Back in your fucking seat.

26:33.844 --> 26:35.053
Yeah.

26:40.767 --> 26:44.521
Well, I can't see anything.
Explains why no one's answering.

26:44.521 --> 26:47.691
I'm sure I heard something.
Try calling the other galleys.

27:03.624 --> 27:06.126
Oh, come on. What difference does it make?

27:12.508 --> 27:14.092
Oh, mate, it's all right. It's--

27:19.264 --> 27:21.058
Listen, we've got an incident.

27:21.058 --> 27:22.309
<i>We've got a major incident--</i>

27:22.309 --> 27:24.228
Wait. Slow down.
I can't hear what you're saying.

27:24.228 --> 27:27.022
They've got control of the whole plane.
They've--

27:35.906 --> 27:37.074
They've got guns.

27:45.874 --> 27:47.668
Colette Fisher.

27:51.129 --> 27:55.676
Dubai, this is Kingdom 2-9.
Dubai, can you hear me?

27:55.676 --> 27:57.678
Kingdom 2-9, you can't keep away.

27:57.678 --> 28:01.849
<i>Dubai, we have a possible
security incident on board. Stand by.</i>

28:02.975 --> 28:05.769
Whatever's happening out there.
We cannot open that door.

28:08.230 --> 28:12.192
Correction, Dubai. That's a definite
security incident on board.

28:12.192 --> 28:14.570
Definite security incident on board.

28:15.195 --> 28:16.947
We all know the score.

28:16.947 --> 28:20.909
If they're Arab or anything like that,
we take 'em on, yeah?

28:22.119 --> 28:23.120
We've got no choice.

28:23.120 --> 28:24.538
That's not a good idea.

28:27.624 --> 28:30.627
You wanna let them crash us
into some capital city, is that it?

28:30.627 --> 28:32.921
Oh, come on.
Is that what you think's gonna happen?

28:33.422 --> 28:34.464
I have no idea, pal.

28:34.464 --> 28:35.757
No. Obviously.

28:36.258 --> 28:38.135
Yeah, but I'm not gonna wait
and find out, am I?

28:39.761 --> 28:42.639
So, what are you gonna do?
You gonna just attack him?

28:43.223 --> 28:44.641
No one's asking you to join in.

28:44.641 --> 28:46.185
You'll get yourself killed.

28:46.185 --> 28:49.104
Listen, if you've not got the balls,

28:50.105 --> 28:52.816
- all you have to do is say.
- Phones, tablets, devices.

28:52.816 --> 28:53.901
Come on.

28:55.569 --> 28:56.778
Thank you.

28:58.488 --> 28:59.489
Phone?

29:00.532 --> 29:03.243
I haven't got it. Listen, you can have it.

29:03.243 --> 29:05.787
It's just, it's in my seat,
and this isn't my seat.

29:05.787 --> 29:07.581
She put me in this seat, remember?

29:31.522 --> 29:34.149
- Okay, now. Let's go.
- We're doing this.

29:37.903 --> 29:39.780
Listen. Listen, guys.

29:40.614 --> 29:43.784
No one is asking you to make this call.
No one. All right?

29:44.535 --> 29:45.994
Just because you speak the loudest

29:45.994 --> 29:47.538
doesn't mean you've got
anything better to say.

29:47.538 --> 29:48.830
It doesn't mean
you've thought this through.

29:48.830 --> 29:50.999
- There's nothing to think through.
- No, there is.

29:50.999 --> 29:53.544
You just haven't thought of it yet.
All right?

29:54.628 --> 29:56.713
Look, this plane took off from Dubai,

29:56.713 --> 30:00.467
so there are people on this flight
that only speak Arabic.

30:00.467 --> 30:01.844
So, if you're gonna hijack a plane,

30:01.844 --> 30:04.555
- Arabic's a language you need to speak.
- Handheld devices.

30:09.226 --> 30:12.521
It doesn't make you a suicide bomber.
It just means you're prepared.

30:13.313 --> 30:16.775
Phones. Tablets.

30:18.318 --> 30:19.695
Devices.

30:21.280 --> 30:22.614
The Wi-Fi is off...

30:25.158 --> 30:26.910
so no need to be a hero.

30:31.748 --> 30:35.419
Until you know who these people are,
do nothing.

30:44.303 --> 30:45.512
It's not gonna work.

30:46.263 --> 30:48.056
They won't let you in.
Not if something's happening.

30:48.056 --> 30:49.308
That's right.

30:50.601 --> 30:51.435
That's the rule.

30:51.435 --> 30:53.770
That's right.
That's why you're gonna convince 'em.

31:08.952 --> 31:10.078
Flight deck.

31:12.789 --> 31:14.416
<i>They want access to the cockpit.</i>

31:16.210 --> 31:17.211
That's not possible.

31:19.755 --> 31:24.134
<i>I know that, but they've got guns,
and they're not giving up.</i>

31:25.469 --> 31:27.137
No, we understand that.
We understand that,

31:27.137 --> 31:30.098
but that's why we can't open the door.
You know that.

31:31.934 --> 31:33.894
- She's saying no.
- She?

31:33.894 --> 31:36.313
- First officer.
- Talk to the pilot.

31:36.313 --> 31:39.233
- He'll say the same thing.
- The pilot. Now.

31:47.824 --> 31:49.826
<i>I need to speak to the captain.</i>

32:03.423 --> 32:04.883
Captain speaking.

32:07.678 --> 32:09.137
<i>They want access to the cockpit.</i>

32:10.681 --> 32:12.099
You know we can't do that.

32:13.100 --> 32:14.434
I know that. I've said that.

32:15.310 --> 32:18.856
Talk to him about last night,
about what it meant to you.

32:19.857 --> 32:20.732
The Plaza.

32:22.150 --> 32:23.735
How do you know about that?

32:23.735 --> 32:28.323
Say it was magical.
Say every trip to Dubai is magical.

32:29.241 --> 32:31.368
- Robin.
- 'Cause you get to be together.

32:32.953 --> 32:34.121
Because you love him.

32:34.788 --> 32:35.789
Robin.

32:36.373 --> 32:37.499
Tell him you love him.

32:38.542 --> 32:39.960
Robbie, they know.

32:42.421 --> 32:43.714
Say it!

32:51.180 --> 32:52.181
<i>Love you.</i>

32:54.057 --> 32:55.100
<i>I love you.</i>

33:01.773 --> 33:03.275
I love you too, Colette.

33:07.070 --> 33:09.823
Either he opens that door,
or I pull this trigger.

33:19.208 --> 33:22.461
He's gonna kill me.
Please, just open the door.

33:22.961 --> 33:25.380
<i>He's gonna blow my head off. Please.</i>

33:38.977 --> 33:42.439
If it doesn't open, we kill this one
and do another one and so on, yeah?

33:47.986 --> 33:49.613
If they take control of this plane,

33:51.323 --> 33:53.367
they can fly it anywhere,
do anything with it.

34:08.340 --> 34:10.509
No. You--

34:10.509 --> 34:12.511
- Robin.
- I don't want to fight you.

34:12.511 --> 34:15.681
Don't make me fight you.
I don't want to fight you.

34:15.681 --> 34:20.185
- No!
- Anna. Anna, s-- Anna, stop!

34:20.185 --> 34:25.357
Stop. Listen to me. Listen to me.
I'm going to open that door, okay?

34:25.357 --> 34:27.317
If you try to stop me, I will hurt you.

34:27.317 --> 34:29.735
You fight me, I will fight you,
and I will win.

34:30.946 --> 34:34.199
Whatever happens,
whatever you think of me,

34:34.199 --> 34:35.701
I'm opening that door.

34:41.748 --> 34:42.748
No.

34:47.045 --> 34:48.839
No! Stop!

34:56.388 --> 34:59.683
Oh, my God.

35:12.112 --> 35:14.323
<i>Kingdom 2-9 is a British A330</i>

35:14.323 --> 35:16.074
<i>now entering the Bahraini airspace.</i>

35:16.074 --> 35:19.703
We'll have contact with it
for another 20 minutes, maximum.

35:20.579 --> 35:22.873
<i>Dubai, this is Kingdom 2-9. Do you copy?</i>

35:24.166 --> 35:25.709
Kingdom 2-9, go ahead.

35:25.709 --> 35:30.255
<i>Dubai, I can report
the incident has now been resolved.</i>

35:30.756 --> 35:31.798
Resolved?

35:32.382 --> 35:36.303
<i>That is correct. I'm happy
to say the entire thing was a false alarm.</i>

35:36.845 --> 35:38.096
<i>We're sorry for any anxiety.</i>

35:38.096 --> 35:40.849
Kingdom 2-9,
you said you had a definite incident.

35:41.350 --> 35:45.103
"Definite security incident on board."
How is that a false alarm?

35:50.234 --> 35:52.069
It turns out there was a--

35:52.653 --> 35:54.279
It was just a couple of drunken passengers

35:54.279 --> 35:55.781
trying to make a sick joke.

35:55.781 --> 35:58.909
We'll be notifying Heathrow
to make sure the police are there

35:58.909 --> 36:00.452
<i>to question them on arrival.</i>

36:00.452 --> 36:01.828
We can do that for you.

36:01.828 --> 36:04.414
- Negative, Dubai.
- <i>It's no problem.</i>

36:05.332 --> 36:06.333
Thank you, Dubai,

36:06.333 --> 36:08.794
but I think we've wasted enough
of your time already.

36:13.090 --> 36:15.884
In that case,
you're now leaving our airspace.

36:15.884 --> 36:18.011
We wish you a safe onward journey.

36:19.471 --> 36:21.014
Kingdom 2-9, copy.

36:24.226 --> 36:27.855
Good. Now turn off the Wi-Fi.

36:44.705 --> 36:46.373
They said there's no Wi-Fi.

36:49.459 --> 36:52.296
If there's no Wi-Fi,
then why take everyone's phones?

37:04.183 --> 37:08.061
This is a 300. I usually fly the 200s.

37:27.623 --> 37:28.749
There.

37:38.383 --> 37:39.384
Here, look.

37:45.766 --> 37:46.892
You did that.

38:18.423 --> 38:19.424
You're disappointed?

38:22.845 --> 38:24.680
No, I'm relieved.

38:26.682 --> 38:28.600
Now you have to do all the paperwork too.

38:29.726 --> 38:31.436
For the plane that cried wolf.

39:14.605 --> 39:15.606
Senil?

39:19.568 --> 39:21.486
Gala?

39:25.365 --> 39:26.366
Senil?

39:57.606 --> 40:00.067
It's just gonna take a bit of time.
That's all.

40:01.068 --> 40:04.112
Well, you've been saying that for months.
What does he expect?

40:07.282 --> 40:09.159
I'm sorry. Not helpful.

40:10.827 --> 40:11.870
You ready for your interview?

40:13.956 --> 40:15.123
I think so.

40:16.291 --> 40:18.210
You're gonna be great. It's gonna be fine.

40:19.086 --> 40:20.671
You're gonna have an amazing day.

40:41.441 --> 40:42.442
What is it?

40:51.201 --> 40:53.120
<i>"This is your cabin crew speaking.</i>

40:54.705 --> 40:56.665
<i>This flight is now under the complete,</i>

40:56.665 --> 41:00.043
<i>and irreversible control
of those who have taken charge.</i>

41:01.503 --> 41:04.381
<i>All means of communication
with the ground has been severed.</i>

41:05.549 --> 41:09.052
<i>Nobody outside of this aircraft
is aware of any issues on board.</i>

41:10.304 --> 41:14.016
<i>The captain and cabin crew have decided</i>

41:14.016 --> 41:18.437
<i>full cooperation is the best
and only way forward.</i>

41:20.063 --> 41:21.064
<i>If--</i>

41:23.483 --> 41:24.818
<i>If you stay calm,</i>

41:25.652 --> 41:29.156
<i>stay in your allocated seats,
and do as instructed,</i>

41:29.156 --> 41:32.993
<i>there is nothing to stop this flight
continuing exactly as it normally would.</i>

41:34.828 --> 41:37.039
Resist, however, and--

41:38.832 --> 41:44.922
Resist, however, and not only
will you be severely punished,

41:45.964 --> 41:49.968
<i>but so too will other innocent passengers
chosen at random</i>

41:49.968 --> 41:52.387
<i>as an example to the rest of the plane."</i>

41:52.387 --> 41:56.016
Take it from me.
That's not gonna get you anywhere.

41:56.016 --> 41:59.019
<i>"Ladies and gentlemen,
this flight is now six hours from London.</i>

41:59.937 --> 42:02.064
<i>Six hours and this will all be over."</i>

42:04.942 --> 42:08.612
I told him. We spoke about it.
I told him not to get on the plane.

42:10.239 --> 42:12.241
Dad wouldn't lie
about something like this.

42:16.286 --> 42:18.705
All right. So, he's on a flight
back from Dubai, yeah?

42:19.206 --> 42:20.457
You got a flight number?

42:20.958 --> 42:21.792
No.

42:24.044 --> 42:25.045
But Mum will.

42:26.129 --> 42:28.799
They'll probably want everything
you have, every detail. Okay?

42:28.799 --> 42:31.343
- What does the message say?
- Kai.

42:31.927 --> 42:32.928
It's important.

42:36.348 --> 42:38.308
Dad says, "I'm flying back.

42:38.308 --> 42:40.811
I need to come back to London
for work meetings."

42:40.811 --> 42:42.604
Mom says, "Stop playing games."

42:42.604 --> 42:44.398
Dad says, "I take off at 9:12."

42:45.023 --> 42:46.775
Mom says, "Do not get on that plane."

42:47.985 --> 42:51.864
Then, an hour ago, Dad says, "Too late."

42:53.699 --> 42:58.871
Then Dad says,
"Incident on board. Serious.

42:59.788 --> 43:02.541
But I'll get home. I love you."

43:05.210 --> 43:06.253
"I always will."

43:23.353 --> 43:24.354
- Get back!
- It's okay.

43:24.354 --> 43:27.107
I'm just doing as she said,
going back to my allocated seat.

43:27.107 --> 43:28.650
Sit the fuck down!

43:28.650 --> 43:31.862
- Stop! What are you doing?
- I'm just getting my phone.

43:32.946 --> 43:35.282
Right, I promised you
I'd give you my phone, and here it is.

43:41.371 --> 43:42.873
What, you come up here just for that?

43:45.751 --> 43:47.044
And to make you an offer.

43:48.962 --> 43:51.256
What exactly does your dad do
for a living?

43:53.634 --> 43:55.302
It's difficult to explain.

43:56.345 --> 43:59.932
He gets brought in by big companies.

43:59.932 --> 44:02.726
If there's a merger or takeover,
it doesn't matter where,

44:03.310 --> 44:04.895
they bring Sam in
at the end of the process,

44:04.895 --> 44:06.438
'cause when it all kicks off...

44:08.607 --> 44:10.317
Sam's the best at handling it.

44:11.151 --> 44:11.985
Handling what?

44:16.448 --> 44:17.574
The negotiation.

44:21.537 --> 44:23.413
Now, listen to me, all right?

44:24.206 --> 44:26.542
There are, like,
some 200 people on this flight,

44:27.042 --> 44:29.002
and most of them will do
exactly as you say.

44:29.002 --> 44:30.587
- That's right.
- But, let's face it,

44:30.587 --> 44:33.257
there are some who will kick off
and who'll cause you problems.

44:33.257 --> 44:34.675
- Sit down.
- No, no.

44:34.675 --> 44:36.635
Let me just tell you where I'm at, okay?

44:40.180 --> 44:42.724
Let me tell you where I'm at with this,
all right?

44:43.517 --> 44:47.145
I don't care about any of those people.
I just wanna get home to my family.

44:47.938 --> 44:49.481
So here's what I'm gonna do.

44:52.693 --> 44:53.819
I'm gonna help you.
