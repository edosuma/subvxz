-Stop! Now! Stop!

-(clattering)
-Heads up!

00:21.067 --> 00:23.533
-* Bad boys, bad boys,
whatcha gonna do... *

00:23.567 --> 00:25.967
I smoked some marijuana!
I'm a marijuana smoker!

00:26.000 --> 00:27.833
-* Bad boys, bad boys *
-Crawl out!

00:27.867 --> 00:29.233
* Whatcha gonna do... *

00:29.267 --> 00:30.467
-Hands up! Hands up!

00:30.500 --> 00:32.367
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it!

00:32.400 --> 00:34.433
-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.467 --> 00:36.533
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.567 --> 00:39.100
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.133 --> 00:41.233
in a court of law.

00:42.433 --> 00:44.333
-Grand Prairie's a fun town
to work in.

00:44.367 --> 00:47.433
It's got a little bit
of everything for adults
and kids,

00:47.467 --> 00:49.500
with Lone Star Park
for horse races,

00:49.533 --> 00:51.733
we've got Minor League baseball.

00:51.767 --> 00:55.333
We're building a new water park
for kids and families.

00:55.367 --> 00:57.800
And we got Joe Pool Lake.
There's a little bit
of everything

00:57.833 --> 01:01.067
for, um, all ages.

01:01.100 --> 01:03.800
We just got dispatched
to a felony wanted subject,

01:03.833 --> 01:05.933
that's supposed to be in a house
around the corner.

01:05.967 --> 01:08.933
Mother-in-law called in and said
that he is there, and that
he may run.

01:08.967 --> 01:11.533
We're gonna meet
with some units
around the corner.

01:13.867 --> 01:16.967
Henry Charles Zebra,
we're at the location.

01:17.067 --> 01:19.433
Hey! (hushed whistles)
Lights are on.

01:19.467 --> 01:22.833
Hear a female's voice.
They're right here in this room.

01:22.867 --> 01:26.067
They're lookin' out.
-(knocking on door)

01:26.100 --> 01:28.067
-Grand Prairie Police,
come to the door.

01:28.067 --> 01:29.733
-(knocking on window)

01:29.767 --> 01:33.133
-(knocking on door)
-Come to the door.
Right now.

01:33.167 --> 01:35.667
-I hear doors closing inside.

01:35.700 --> 01:38.133
-Got a female.

01:38.167 --> 01:41.267
-We got contact at the back.

01:41.300 --> 01:43.133
-Hey, ma'am.
We need to speak to Billy.

01:43.167 --> 01:44.633
-Who?
-Billy.

01:44.667 --> 01:47.067
-Billy's not here.
-Yeah? He was here earlier.

01:47.067 --> 01:48.600
His car's here.
Where is he?

01:48.633 --> 01:50.067
-That's my car, sir.
-Where is he?

01:50.100 --> 01:51.667
-Can we come and check?

01:51.700 --> 01:53.067
We'll need to come look.

01:53.100 --> 01:55.100
-Nobody's in here
but me and my kids.

01:55.133 --> 01:57.333
-All right, we need
to come look.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.067
-We got-- We got--
We got good information
that he's here.

02:00.067 --> 02:02.167
-He's not here.
Nobody's here
but me and my kids.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.067
-Tell us where he is
and something bad
doesn't happen.

02:04.067 --> 02:06.633
-We-- I don't want anything bad
to happen to me, you,
or your kids, where's he at?

02:06.667 --> 02:08.367
-Nobody's here
but me and my kids.

02:08.400 --> 02:11.300
-Just tell us where he's at.
-He's at his dad's house...

02:11.333 --> 02:13.867
that's my car,
I drive that car to work.

02:13.900 --> 02:16.500
My brother and them
was here yesterday.

02:16.533 --> 02:19.933
They all left.
No one's here.

02:19.967 --> 02:22.233
But me and my kids.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.767
He's not here, sir.

02:23.800 --> 02:27.400
Nobody's here
but me and my kids.

02:27.433 --> 02:30.067
-(ceiling collapsing,
hitting floor)

02:30.067 --> 02:32.233
-Get your hands up--
Right there-- Hands up!

02:32.267 --> 02:34.467
Get on the ground!
-Hold it down.

02:35.633 --> 02:37.200
-Get down!

02:37.233 --> 02:38.433
-Give me your hands.

02:38.467 --> 02:41.800
-Thanks for flyin'.
Watch her, put your hands up!

02:41.833 --> 02:43.233
Don't reach somewhere!

02:43.267 --> 02:45.633
-Aaaah! She didn't even know
I was here, you guys.
-Hush!

02:45.667 --> 02:47.067
-She didn't!
-You're under arrest.

02:47.067 --> 02:50.400
-Y'all takin' her to jail?
-Hush. She lied for you.

02:50.433 --> 02:51.833
-Do you have any weapons on you?

02:51.867 --> 02:54.333
-No. What am I
have a weapon for?
She didn't know I was here.

02:54.367 --> 02:56.867
-She didn't know
you were here, but you were
up in the attic.

02:56.900 --> 02:58.200
-I came here
when she was asleep.

02:58.233 --> 03:01.200
-We got information
knowin' you were here all day.

03:01.233 --> 03:03.933
Uh, we got positive ID.
-Anybody else up in the attic?

03:03.967 --> 03:05.233
-Uh-uh.
-Just you?

03:05.267 --> 03:07.333
-Just me.
-That makes sense
with the loud noise we heard

03:07.367 --> 03:09.333
when we knocked on the door.
-Yeah, he went up in the attic.

03:09.367 --> 03:11.067
-Yep.
-Who told y'all that I was here?

03:11.100 --> 03:12.700
-Don't worry about it.
-A little fairy.

03:12.733 --> 03:14.867
Thirty-six, we got one
in custody, clear channel.

03:16.333 --> 03:17.633
She's LLPOF.

03:17.667 --> 03:19.133
-Knew he was here
the way she was talkin'.

03:19.167 --> 03:22.267
-Oh yeah.
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

03:22.300 --> 03:26.733
When we were outside
we heard a loud noise...
like a door closing

03:26.767 --> 03:31.533
or somethin'.
So, this is after the female
peeks out the window at us.

03:31.567 --> 03:34.233
She comes to the door,
she starts loud announcing
that nobody's here,

03:34.267 --> 03:40.233
and he was obviously
up in the ceiling
and crashed down.

03:40.267 --> 03:42.933
He's lucky he didn't get hurt.

03:42.967 --> 03:47.567
All this debris is similar
to what's here, 'cause
he went up in the attic.

03:47.600 --> 03:50.467
Through here.
-Y'all woke me up
outta my sleep.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.533
-Okay, here's the deal.
We're past that, okay?

03:52.567 --> 03:55.100
Like we've already told you,
when we were outside,
we heard the thud

03:55.133 --> 03:57.833
of y'all gettin' him up
in the attic,
everything else.

03:57.867 --> 03:59.467
Why would you lie to us?

03:59.500 --> 04:01.267
We all know you knew
he was here.

04:01.300 --> 04:02.500
So let's not compound
on the lies.

04:02.533 --> 04:05.167
-I'm not sure.
-You're not sure?

04:05.200 --> 04:07.500
-What were you reaching for
when I had to point my gun
at you

04:07.533 --> 04:09.733
because, while
we're dealin' with him
after he crashes through,

04:09.767 --> 04:11.533
you start reachin'
around in there?
-Because I'm about

04:11.567 --> 04:16.233
to give my kids some clothes,
'cause they in their, um,
night clothes.

04:16.267 --> 04:18.767
I was gonna ask--
I did ask him.
-Ma'am, why would you

04:18.800 --> 04:20.800
put your children
in this position?

04:20.833 --> 04:23.467
-I don't know, sir. Sorry.

04:23.500 --> 04:26.733
-Don't apologize to me.
You need to apologize
to your children.

04:26.767 --> 04:30.067
'Cause you're the one
who put your children
in the position

04:30.067 --> 04:33.300
to watch police
have to point guns at people
that come crashin'

04:33.333 --> 04:34.733
through the roof--
-I'm not for sure.

04:34.767 --> 04:37.800
-You're not for sure.
How old are you?
-I'm 28 years old.

04:37.833 --> 04:39.967
-You're 28, okay,
you said you were scared.

04:40.067 --> 04:41.900
-Yes, sir.
-So, what were you scared of,

04:41.933 --> 04:44.567
that the big bad police
were comin' in to hurt you?

04:44.600 --> 04:47.733
-I did not know
why y'all was here...
-We told you why we were here.

04:47.767 --> 04:51.733
We were looking for him.
You could go to jail right now
for interfering,

04:51.767 --> 04:53.767
harboring a fugitive.

04:53.800 --> 04:56.833
-(sniffs)
-If you wanna be an effective
mother to those children,

04:56.867 --> 05:00.933
quit hangin' around people
that like to fight the police,
run f-- run from the police,

05:00.967 --> 05:03.967
and quit settin' bad examples
of let's lie to the police.

05:04.067 --> 05:05.467
Okay?
-Yes, sir.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.567
-We're gonna start over
on a brand new slate now?

05:07.600 --> 05:09.800
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, so if we come across you
in the future,

05:09.833 --> 05:11.267
you're not gonna lie to us?
-No.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.367
-All right.

05:13.567 --> 05:14.800
Hey, Billy, how are you, man?

05:14.833 --> 05:16.600
-All right.
-Hey, are those your kids?

05:16.633 --> 05:19.467
-Yeah, they're my stepkids.
-They're your stepkids,
so you're not bio-dad.

05:19.500 --> 05:22.167
-No.
-Why would you put those kids
in danger like that, man?

05:22.200 --> 05:24.800
-Uh, bein' stupid.
-You know you got
warrants, right?

05:24.833 --> 05:26.700
-Yeah, I got a warrant
for a probation violation.

05:26.733 --> 05:28.067
-From runnin'
from the police?

05:28.067 --> 05:29.867
When did you climb up
in the-- in the attic?

05:29.900 --> 05:31.800
After you heard me say,
hey, it's the police?

05:31.833 --> 05:34.333
I seen your little earpiece
in your ear.
-Hmm.

05:34.367 --> 05:36.633
-Yeah.
When you s-- When I seen
that earpiece,

05:36.667 --> 05:40.433
I said, oh, yeah,
them the police.
Say yeah, I gotta-- I gotta run.

05:40.467 --> 05:43.733
-Okay.
-And then, you know--
I had to do what I gotta do,

05:43.767 --> 05:46.067
you know?
I wasn't gonna harm y'all.

05:46.067 --> 05:47.867
Y'all...
-You understand
we don't know that, right?

05:47.900 --> 05:48.933
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-At the time?

05:48.967 --> 05:50.200
-'Cause y'all don't know me.
-No, sir.

05:50.233 --> 05:51.433
-And I don't know y'all.
-No.

05:51.467 --> 05:53.300
-You know, I thought
y'all were gonna harm me.

05:53.333 --> 05:55.567
-Why would we do that?
Let me ask you that question.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.767
Why would you think
that we would come to harm you?

05:57.800 --> 06:00.900
-All's I seen was guns.
-Okay, well, keep in mind,

06:00.933 --> 06:03.067
we're goin'
into an unknown place...
-Yeah...

06:03.100 --> 06:05.267
-after somebody
with a felony warrant.

06:05.300 --> 06:09.267
Somebody that I know
to be hidin' because I heard
the attic door closin'.

06:09.300 --> 06:11.633
I mean, how do you--
How else would you expect us
to respond?

06:11.667 --> 06:13.833
-Comin' with guns.
-'Cause some guy comes crashin'
through the roof

06:13.867 --> 06:16.067
like Santa Claus,
and we'll be like,
"Hey, man, what's your name?"

06:16.067 --> 06:18.067
You know,
just normal conversation?
That's not how it works,

06:18.100 --> 06:20.500
you know that.
But we're not here
to hurt you.

06:20.533 --> 06:22.900
-Uh-- Uh, I know.
-So at the end of the day,
the end result

06:22.933 --> 06:24.333
is what happened, right?

06:24.367 --> 06:26.500
-Mm-hm.
-You knew this is gonna happen,
no matter what?

06:26.533 --> 06:30.300
-Yeah, it was a matter of time
y'all was comin', 'cause I been
runnin' since July.

06:30.333 --> 06:32.533
-You gonna do it again?
-No, man.

06:32.567 --> 06:35.367
-Come on.
You won't?
-No, I ain't gonna

06:35.400 --> 06:39.333
do it no more.
-Well, shame on her
for puttin' the kids at risk,

06:39.367 --> 06:41.233
shame on you
for puttin' the kids at risk.

06:41.267 --> 06:44.700
Because like we said
just a second ago, we don't know
who you are, you don't know us.

06:44.733 --> 06:47.067
-Yeah, it was real dumb.
It was real stupid.

06:47.067 --> 06:50.100
-Neither one of you
get Parent of the Year awards
right now.

06:50.133 --> 06:51.667
All right?
-Yes, sir.

06:51.700 --> 06:53.133
-All right, buddy.
-All right. Thanks.

06:53.167 --> 06:54.300
-All right.

06:56.567 --> 06:59.100
He's good at running
to a certain degree,
but he's terrible at hiding,

06:59.133 --> 07:00.800
'cause he likes
to fall through roofs.

07:03.467 --> 07:05.633
-We-- We have a lot of females
on this shift in particular,

07:05.667 --> 07:08.333
but in squad two we actually
have the most females

07:08.367 --> 07:11.200
on a particular squad,
and it's actually fun

07:11.233 --> 07:15.200
to be able to work alongside
other powerful female deputies.

07:15.233 --> 07:17.567
Goin' to different calls
with them, and showing

07:17.600 --> 07:20.900
little girls that we can do
just... everything that males

07:20.933 --> 07:23.067
can do, and just
getting the job done.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.933
We're headed to a 9-1-1 hang up.

07:25.967 --> 07:28.233
The call taker heard a female
screaming in the background,

07:28.267 --> 07:30.500
so it's sounding more like
a domestic.

07:30.533 --> 07:35.200
Said the suspect was last seen
on foot, white male, bald,

07:35.233 --> 07:39.100
about six foot.
This looks like him.

07:39.133 --> 07:42.433
-(car door opening)
-Hello.

07:42.467 --> 07:43.700
Hey.
-What?

07:43.733 --> 07:44.900
-Stop for a second.

07:44.933 --> 07:46.567
-I ain't stoppin' for nothin'.
-Come here.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.167
-I told you to stop.
-I ain't did nothin' wrong.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.867
-You need to come here.
-I ain't gonna do it.

07:49.900 --> 07:53.700
-No, you need to stop.
We don't even know
if you're involved in anything.

07:53.733 --> 07:56.200
-(radio chatter)

07:59.500 --> 08:02.400
-(Taser crackling)
-(indistinct yelling)

08:02.433 --> 08:03.600
-Stay down!
-Flip over!

08:03.633 --> 08:06.467
-Okay!
-Over! Now!

08:06.500 --> 08:07.933
Put your hand behind your back.

08:07.967 --> 08:11.300
-Where's my rights,
'cause I didn't
do nothin' wrong.

08:11.333 --> 08:14.067
-If you did nothin' wrong,
we would sort that out.
-You did do somethin' wrong.

08:14.067 --> 08:16.967
-Voice on radio:
Units, there is a female
with the subject.

08:17.067 --> 08:18.767
Stand by.
-Do not resist.

08:18.800 --> 08:23.367
-I'm not resistin'.
All this started over,
I asked for a pack

08:23.400 --> 08:26.667
of cigarettes, she gave me
her card to go get a pack
of cigarettes,

08:26.700 --> 08:29.467
I come out the door,
she's like, "Give me back
my card!"

08:29.500 --> 08:31.333
She did it all on purpose
to set it up.

08:31.367 --> 08:33.467
-How do you know her?
-That's my wife.

08:33.500 --> 08:36.900
-Have you used
her card in the past?
-Yes, every day.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.567
-Take a deep breath.
Go ahead, bro.

08:41.300 --> 08:43.533
-You're not gonna give us
any more problems, correct?
-No, ma'am.

08:43.567 --> 08:46.667
I did that-- I did that
'cause, you know what I mean--
sh-- all this stuff for nothin'.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.333
-Yeah, but if you woulda
just stopped, we could've
sorted that out.

08:49.367 --> 08:52.533
-I wasn't sortin' nothin' out.
The-- The man is always
the bad guy.

08:52.567 --> 08:55.867
-All right, roll over
on your butt.
-(groans)

08:55.900 --> 08:58.133
-(radio chatter)

08:58.167 --> 09:00.600
-You're gonna stand
all the way up.
-One, two, three (grunts).

09:00.633 --> 09:01.867
Thank you.

09:01.900 --> 09:04.167
-Walk him that way
to Chieco's car.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.433
Chieco!
-She gave me the card
to get a pack of cigarettes.

09:07.467 --> 09:10.633
As soon as I walked out
the door, she's like, "Oh,
he's takin' my card! No, no!"

09:10.667 --> 09:12.933
-She handed you her card?
-She followed me all the way
here. Oh, yeah.

09:12.967 --> 09:15.067
-Okay, hop in.
-Watch your head.

09:15.100 --> 09:18.400
-Mmm...

09:18.433 --> 09:20.733
She blames it all on me,
but it takes two
in a relationship,

09:20.767 --> 09:22.167
you know what I mean?

09:22.200 --> 09:24.167
Um...
-So you guys live together,
you're in a relationship?

09:24.200 --> 09:26.467
-We're married, man,
we got four kids together.
-And they all live

09:26.500 --> 09:28.200
at that same house?
-Oh, yeah.

09:28.233 --> 09:30.600
-Okay.
-Anyways,
like 10, 20 minutes ago,

09:30.633 --> 09:33.567
I come in, I say, "Babe,
will you go with me
to get a pack of cigarettes?"

09:33.600 --> 09:36.100
-Mm-hm.
-She said, "No, here, just take
the card," and I thought

09:36.133 --> 09:39.467
it was kinda funny to me,
'cause she don't trust me
with her card.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.633
A while back I had
a drug problem.

09:41.667 --> 09:43.133
-Why would--
-Soon as she handed
me the card--

09:43.167 --> 09:45.100
As soon as she handed me
the card, she--

09:45.133 --> 09:46.767
'Cause we was
in the bedroom, she started--

09:46.800 --> 09:50.067
'Cause she shut the door.
She started screamin',
"Oh, he took my card!

09:50.100 --> 09:53.167
Mom! Call 9-1-1!"
I'm like, what?
-Why would she do that?

09:53.200 --> 09:56.400
-As I was tryin' to leave,
her mom was tryin' to block me
from the door to get out

09:56.433 --> 09:58.167
the door.
I said, "Just let me go."
-Does her mom

09:58.200 --> 10:00.300
live at the address too?
-Oh, yeah.
That's the big--

10:00.333 --> 10:02.600
That's the problem.
-Okay.

10:02.633 --> 10:05.333
All right.
Did you push her,
shove her?

10:05.367 --> 10:07.867
-I didn't push her.
She's hit me, but I mean--
but it's nothin'.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.667
-Hit you how?
-She gets-- She was mad,
you know what I mean?

10:10.700 --> 10:12.033
-Mm-hm.
-She just--

10:12.067 --> 10:14.700
-Why would she want you
to get arrested?

10:14.733 --> 10:18.133
I mean, it seems that she just
wants you to call the police,
like why would she want you--

10:18.167 --> 10:21.900
-I don't know, it just--
as soon as I-- as soon as she
handed me the card,

10:21.933 --> 10:27.267
I started walkin' away,
she started hollerin',
"Mom! Call 9-1-1! Call 9-1-1!"

10:27.300 --> 10:29.200
-Mm-hm.
-I mean, that's the truth.
You know what I mean?

10:29.233 --> 10:30.467
So...
-Okay.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.233
-It is what it is.
-All right, hang on
just a second,

10:32.267 --> 10:35.000
I'll be right back with you.

10:35.033 --> 10:38.367
-So I got the kids to bed.
I was in the bedroom
brushing my hair,

10:38.400 --> 10:42.767
I just got out of the shower.
And I hear this loud crash.
And that's him.

10:42.800 --> 10:46.733
When you lock the back door,
and you yank it hard enough,
you can open it.

10:46.767 --> 10:49.333
So he opens--
That's how he gets in,
and he-- I-- I go--

10:49.367 --> 10:51.367
I get out of the bed,
and I go to the room,
I'm like,

10:51.400 --> 10:54.833
what the hell is that noise?
And he walks in and he throws
his shirt right in my face.

10:54.867 --> 10:56.700
-Okay.
-I was like, "Why did you throw
your shirt at me?"

10:56.733 --> 10:59.500
He goes, "I didn't throw
my shirt at you, bitch.
I was like, "Yes, you did."

10:59.533 --> 11:02.400
He goes, "No, I didn't,
I didn't throw my shirt at you,
you dumb bitch."

11:02.433 --> 11:04.200
And he kept just callin' me
all these obscenities,

11:04.233 --> 11:06.200
and then he went
into the bathroom
to do something,

11:06.233 --> 11:08.500
and he came back
with a hand towel, and I was
pattin' the baby's butt

11:08.533 --> 11:10.367
to get her
back to bed, 'cause she woke up,

11:10.400 --> 11:13.067
'cause all the commotion.
And I turn around 'cause
he said somethin'

11:13.067 --> 11:15.367
and he slung the towel again
at me.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.567
And I go, "Why did you do that?"
And he goes, "I didn't
do nothin', I don't know

11:18.600 --> 11:20.467
what you're talkin' about.
I didn't do nothin'."

11:20.500 --> 11:23.700
So, and then he--
then he sees my wallet,
and he makes a beeline

11:23.733 --> 11:26.533
to the other side of the bed
with the wallet, and he goes
and he grabs it,

11:26.567 --> 11:29.733
I'm tryin' to fight him for it.
I'm tryin' to fight him
for my wallet.

11:29.767 --> 11:33.200
And my mom, I kept yellin'
for her to call 9-1-1,
call 9-1-1.

11:33.233 --> 11:36.500
And of course they're slow,
'cause they're old.
And they're like, "Ohhh..."

11:36.533 --> 11:39.333
I'm like, "Call 9-1-1,
it's important, call 9-1-1."
-Mm-hm.

11:39.367 --> 11:42.833
-And he wouldn't,
and he bolted out the door,
so I'm followin' him.

11:42.867 --> 11:44.800
I get there and I'm just,
"Give me my card, please,"

11:44.833 --> 11:48.300
and he grabs my face,
and he pushes me down.

11:48.333 --> 11:52.133
And I didn't fall to the ground,
but he pushes me--
-Did anybody else witness that?

11:52.167 --> 11:53.633
-I don't know.
-Your mom or anything?

11:53.667 --> 11:56.400
-Yeah.
Even my eight-year-old seen it,
she's hysterical crying.

11:56.433 --> 11:58.633
-Now, is your bank account--
-No.

11:58.667 --> 12:00.233
-a joint account?
-No.

12:00.267 --> 12:02.767
-It's just yours?
-It's just my account,
because he has a--

12:02.800 --> 12:05.667
he has a crack addiction,
and he will spend
all of my money,

12:05.700 --> 12:07.667
and I cannot pay my bills.
-Okay.

12:07.700 --> 12:10.900
-And I have children.
So I took his name
off that account,

12:10.933 --> 12:14.800
but he steals the card.
And the card-- That other card
he stole was my daughter's

12:14.833 --> 12:17.867
social security card.
-Has he been able to use it
in the past, though?

12:17.900 --> 12:20.633
-Yeah-- Well, yeah,
he uses it, you know
what I mean, but--

12:20.667 --> 12:22.467
-Okay.
So he has your PIN
and all that stuff.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.467
-Yeah.
-Okay.

12:24.500 --> 12:27.700
-Oh, you're bleeding, I'm sorry.
-Uh, I think it's
your boyfriend's blood.

12:27.733 --> 12:29.600
-Oh, good, he deserves it.

12:29.633 --> 12:32.700
-Um, has he done this before
in the past, that you know of?
-Yes.

12:32.733 --> 12:34.967
-Okay, so he's been arrested
for domestic battery
in the past?

12:35.067 --> 12:36.067
-Yes.

12:39.233 --> 12:42.267
-This is your debit card?
-That's my daughter's
SSI card.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.833
I can check at home
if the red card's there.

12:44.867 --> 12:49.133
-All right.
Um, my understanding, if there's
witnesses at the scene,

12:49.167 --> 12:51.167
it's gonna be domestic battery.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.600
Obviously resisting.
He took a credit card

12:53.633 --> 12:56.400
or SSI card, but he's been able
to use it in the past.

12:56.433 --> 12:57.600
-Yeah, that's not gonna
be a charge.

12:57.633 --> 12:59.100
-Yeah.
-Just gonna stick
with the domestic,

12:59.133 --> 13:01.067
that's all we have.
-Okay.

13:01.100 --> 13:03.400
-Slide in.
-Can't trust me, I know.

13:03.433 --> 13:06.600
-What's that?
-(indistinct)

13:06.633 --> 13:08.800
She's the one that hit me.
I'm tryin' to get out the house,

13:08.833 --> 13:11.067
her and her mother
are stoppin' me
from gettin' out the house.

13:11.067 --> 13:13.067
I'm tryin' to leave
to defuse the problem.

13:13.100 --> 13:15.300
It's fine, though,
do what you gotta do.

13:15.333 --> 13:17.367
-Okay.
-Thank you.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.633
-Well, why is everybody else
sayin' that you're-- you're
the one

13:19.667 --> 13:21.233
that's causin' the problem?
-Oh, 'cause I'm--

13:21.267 --> 13:23.500
'cause I'm always the bad guy,
you know what I mean?

13:23.533 --> 13:25.133
I'm done talkin'.

13:25.167 --> 13:27.567
-Okay.
You're bein' charged
with domestic battery,

13:27.600 --> 13:30.933
and also resisting arrest.
-That's fine, uh,
do what you gotta do.

13:34.067 --> 13:36.400
-It was never my plan
to initially ever become a cop.

13:36.433 --> 13:39.733
But, uh, after years of working
in the private protection field,

13:39.767 --> 13:42.533
I took a job in the prisons,
and then I decided

13:42.567 --> 13:44.533
I needed to get out
on the streets.

13:44.567 --> 13:46.633
And I have a lot of fun
with this job,

13:46.667 --> 13:50.067
and... you get to experience
something new every day.

13:50.100 --> 13:53.167
We got a car, basically
they're speeding through
a residential neighborhood.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.800
They've slowed down now,
they realize a cop's behind 'em.

13:55.833 --> 13:59.667
We're gonna pull 'em over.
It looks like it's occupied
by about three individuals.

13:59.700 --> 14:02.367
South 19, traffic.
-Voice on radio:
South 19.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.333
-Betty and Linda
on a white Toyota--
We got a bailer!

14:06.433 --> 14:08.467
-Get on the ground!
-Get on the ground!

14:08.500 --> 14:09.833
-(indistinct) Go, go, go!

14:09.867 --> 14:12.833
-(siren blaring)
-Get your hands up!

14:12.867 --> 14:16.133
-Street crime 2 foot pursuit.
You got 19 and 16
in pursuit,

14:16.167 --> 14:17.900
I have two at gunpoint.
-(radio chatter)

14:17.933 --> 14:19.800
-Don't move!
Hands up! Get out!

14:19.833 --> 14:21.933
One at a time!
Lady, you stay!
Get out!

14:21.967 --> 14:23.567
-(sirens sounding)
-Walk to the front
of that car.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.233
-(radio chatter)
-Right here.
Put your hands on the car.

14:26.267 --> 14:29.267
-(radio chatter)
-Give me your right hand.

14:29.300 --> 14:33.267
-(radio chatter)
-Ma'am! Step out!
Keep your hands up!

14:33.300 --> 14:35.600
Walk back! Keep your hands up,
and don't move 'em.

14:35.633 --> 14:36.967
-(radio chatter)

14:37.067 --> 14:41.633
-Stop!
-Sir, can I ask you
what's goin' on?

14:41.667 --> 14:44.467
-What's goin' on?
All right, have a seat.
Right next to him.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.800
You got them?
Sit. Sit, stay with him.

14:47.833 --> 14:50.133
They're in the yards.
I'll be right there.

14:50.167 --> 14:53.600
Guys! Talk!
Where are you at?

14:53.633 --> 14:56.067
-Right back here!
-What'd I do, man?

14:56.067 --> 14:58.067
-Don't reach for me!
-Stupid, dude.

14:58.100 --> 15:00.533
-Why'd you run?
Why didn't you
just sit in the car?

15:00.567 --> 15:03.367
Why didn't you
put your hands up?
-I'm a (bleep) idiot,

15:03.400 --> 15:05.267
dude, no, uh, no--
-You think you're gonna bail,

15:05.300 --> 15:07.233
and get away?
-I knew I wasn't, dude.

15:07.267 --> 15:09.367
-You thought you were gonna
get away from me?
-No, man.

15:09.400 --> 15:10.600
-Then why'd you run?

15:10.633 --> 15:12.067
-Just a little tear?
-Uh, you need a medic?

15:12.067 --> 15:13.867
-No, I'm good.
-Do you need a medic?

15:13.900 --> 15:15.767
-Do you need
medical attention?
-No, you guys, uh,

15:15.800 --> 15:19.167
hey, listen, I, again, I--
-Let's go.

15:19.200 --> 15:20.633
-Where's your shoes at, bud?

15:20.667 --> 15:22.767
-He ran so fast,
he ran right out of--
-Right out of your shoes.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.900
-They're at that other fence
over there.

15:24.933 --> 15:27.300
-They're way over
the first fence he--
-All right, let's walk him out,

15:27.333 --> 15:29.933
fellas.
-I'm gonna backtrack
the path, see if he dropped it.

15:29.967 --> 15:31.667
-You check for the dope, yeah.

15:31.700 --> 15:34.100
-We've been lookin' for this guy
for about three weeks.

15:34.133 --> 15:35.767
He's part of a big, huge
burglary ring.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.967
He stole a cop's motorcycle
out of, uh, California.

15:39.067 --> 15:41.867
We've been huntin' him
for a while now, and he knows
we've been huntin' him.

15:41.900 --> 15:44.767
And that's why he stated
he ran here today.

15:44.800 --> 15:49.567
Um, he has a long history
of drug abuse, theft, uh,

15:49.600 --> 15:51.933
fighting with the police,
violence with the police.

15:51.967 --> 15:53.867
Looks like he's still resisting.

15:53.900 --> 15:55.567
Um, these are the people
that are drivin' the car.

15:55.600 --> 15:58.800
I don't know their story,
so I'm gonna, uh, talk to them.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.500
See what we can get goin'
from there.

16:01.533 --> 16:04.300
Uh, what did he say to you
when we tried to pull you over?

16:04.333 --> 16:07.133
-All he said was, "Dude,
what are you doin'?
We gotta go,"

16:07.167 --> 16:09.400
and I said, "Dude, I--
I gotta do what
I'm supposed to."

16:09.433 --> 16:12.200
-We saw you drive down Basin
when we were on the side
of the road.

16:12.233 --> 16:14.867
-Uh-huh.
-And you did an abrupt movement
to turn down here,

16:14.900 --> 16:16.833
which is super suspicious.
-Well, I have no power steering.

16:16.867 --> 16:17.900
-All right.
-That's why.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.067
-But it looked like
you were tryin'

16:19.100 --> 16:20.300
to get away from us.

16:20.333 --> 16:21.733
-Oh, okay.
No. Not at all.
-And he's in the car.

16:21.767 --> 16:23.800
We stop you, bam,
he runs outta the car,
-Yeah, not at all.

16:23.833 --> 16:25.800
-You gotta look at it
from my perspective, brother.
-Yeah.

16:25.833 --> 16:29.067
-It looks
super, super suspicious
when some-- you stop a car,

16:29.067 --> 16:30.900
and then a guy-- voop --
bolts outta the car.

16:30.933 --> 16:33.733
-And, like I was just
tellin' that officer, the reason
I even went and picked him up

16:33.767 --> 16:35.767
is 'cause those three
orange caps right there?

16:35.800 --> 16:38.833
I found those in my car
the last time he was in my car.

16:38.867 --> 16:41.300
-Okay. So...
-I don't know if they
were his or not.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.133
I was gonna ask him.
-Do you have any drugs
in this car?

16:43.167 --> 16:44.767
-I don't.
-Okay, do you use drugs
at all?

16:44.800 --> 16:46.700
-No.
I mean, I used to.
-What do you use, meth?

16:46.733 --> 16:48.867
-I smoke weed.
-Just weed? Any meth, heroin?

16:48.900 --> 16:51.600
-I used to use meth.
-Okay. How long-- when's
the last time you used meth?

16:51.633 --> 16:53.067
-I don't even know.

16:53.100 --> 16:55.067
-Okay.
Are you guys, uh,
girlfriend, boyfriend?

16:55.100 --> 16:57.067
-Yeah.
-He seen that there's a cop
on the side of the road,

16:57.067 --> 16:59.600
or, I didn't-- I was passed out,
honestly, I was like
half-- halfway asleep

16:59.633 --> 17:02.567
in the front seat.
So, and I remember Lance
started tripping out,

17:02.600 --> 17:04.767
and I was like,
"What's goin' on," you know,
and at that time

17:04.800 --> 17:09.333
there was two cars behind us.
And I-- he didn't really say
nothin' to me, he was just like,

17:09.367 --> 17:13.067
"You gotta-- You gotta go."
And you know, he's like,
"You gotta go, you gotta go,"

17:13.100 --> 17:15.967
or some (bleep) like that.
-All right. Then you stopped,
and bam, he got out?

17:16.067 --> 17:17.933
-Yeah, he took off runnin'
like a (bleep) idiot.

17:17.967 --> 17:22.400
-All right, hang tight
for me, guys, we'll get you
outta here in a minute, okay?

17:22.433 --> 17:27.100
-He's got a bad drug history.
These are two hypodermic needles
taken off of the suspect,

17:27.133 --> 17:28.533
loaded with methamphetamine.

17:28.567 --> 17:31.400
-And we pulled a baggie
of methamphetamine out
of his pocket.

17:31.433 --> 17:34.133
-Yeah, Lance,
next time, don't run, bro!
It's not worth runnin'.

17:34.167 --> 17:37.200
-I don't know if you guys
have ever been on drugs,
you know what that's like,

17:37.233 --> 17:40.533
man.
It ain't nothin' (bleep)
pretty, dude.

17:40.567 --> 17:44.400
You know what I'm sayin',
I'm-- I'm honestly, I'm
not a bad guy, I mean,

17:44.433 --> 17:47.567
you guys, sure, you've heard
that all the time,
but, I'm not, man.

17:47.600 --> 17:51.167
I-- I-- I was raised
better than this, man.
I was doin' all right

17:51.200 --> 17:54.067
with my life.
I got caught up and then,
been trying to get clean.

17:54.067 --> 17:57.600
I have another kid on the way.
-How many kids is that?

17:57.633 --> 18:00.867
-It's gonna be
my second one, man,
and I'm (bleep) terrified

18:00.900 --> 18:03.100
to death.
-Lance, let me
ask you something.

18:03.133 --> 18:08.100
-What, man?
-Do you think your children
would want to see their dad

18:08.133 --> 18:10.867
runnin'
from five police officers
-No, man.

18:10.900 --> 18:13.367
-in the middle of the night?
-Do you think I would wanna
teach my kids that?

18:13.400 --> 18:15.067
Absolutely not.
-Then why'd you run?

18:15.100 --> 18:18.267
-Man, I knew you guys
were lookin' for me for some
fake bull(bleep), and I--

18:18.300 --> 18:21.933
-Okay, so why, if it-- if it's
so fake, why'd you run, man?

18:21.967 --> 18:24.133
You know that doesn't
help your case.
-Put yourself in my position,

18:24.167 --> 18:26.133
I'm already on--
I'm already on the run
from you guys, right?

18:26.167 --> 18:28.133
-Lance, that don't
help your kids, man.
-I didn't say-- You--

18:28.167 --> 18:29.967
-That don't help your kids, man.
-You're right, man.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.667
-When you want us
to believe you, when
you wanna try

18:31.700 --> 18:34.133
to justify yourself
or somethin', or you think
somebody's lyin'...

18:34.167 --> 18:36.200
the best thing would be
to call or come talk--
-But do you know

18:36.233 --> 18:38.300
how hard it is--
Do you know how hard it is
to even try to think

18:38.333 --> 18:41.067
in a clear head like that
when you're already (bleep) up,
not only on drugs,

18:41.067 --> 18:43.133
but on life?
-No, because you constantly
wanna do meth, man.

18:43.167 --> 18:45.067
You're gonna have time
to get better.
You got kids.

18:45.067 --> 18:47.933
You can't think clear on meth.
-Hey, dude, it ain't even
the meth that's the problem.

18:47.967 --> 18:49.900
It ain't even
no good anymore, man.

18:49.933 --> 18:53.133
-Yeah, let's put him
in the back of this car
for right now.

18:53.167 --> 18:56.467
He's on a no-bail, parole
and probation warrant
out of the State of Nevada.

18:56.500 --> 19:00.400
He's also being arrested
for, uh, grand theft auto
of a motorcycle

19:00.433 --> 19:02.933
that he stole
from a police officer
in California.

19:02.967 --> 19:06.500
PCS methamphetamine,
resisting arrest,
obstruction of justice,

19:06.533 --> 19:10.067
as well as another burglary
that we have against him.

19:10.100 --> 19:12.233
All right, let's go
talk to them, one more time.

19:12.267 --> 19:15.733
Dallas and Brittany,
I do appreciate you complying
and staying put,

19:15.767 --> 19:17.400
and listening
to all my directions
and orders,

19:17.433 --> 19:19.467
and I-- I appreciate it,
and look what happened.

19:19.500 --> 19:23.067
Hey, you got detained,
you-- Nothin'-- You didn't
get beat up, no one got shot,

19:23.100 --> 19:26.533
everyone goes home safe.
You're not even going to jail,
you know it?

19:26.567 --> 19:29.133
And, uh, my partner here,
I don't know what-- um,

19:29.167 --> 19:30.833
you gonna write 'em
a ticket or no?
-No.

19:30.867 --> 19:31.967
-No?
-No.

19:32.067 --> 19:33.367
See? Look at that.
-Well, thank you, guys.

19:33.400 --> 19:37.233
-So-- But next time...
-The next time, I'm askin' em

19:37.267 --> 19:39.300
if they got warrants
and all that (bleep).
(laughs)

19:39.333 --> 19:42.133
-Well, just make sure, man,
you use your turn signals,
make sure you're-- you're

19:42.167 --> 19:44.633
obeyin' the speed limits,
especially in the residential
neighborhoods.

19:44.667 --> 19:46.433
-Yeah.
-But we appreciate
your cooperation

19:46.467 --> 19:48.833
a hundred percent.
-Thank you, guys,
for being nice.

19:50.233 --> 19:52.067
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.067 --> 19:54.067
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.167
Cover is code three.

19:55.200 --> 19:58.167
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:05.133 --> 20:07.100
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:07.133 --> 20:10.133
-(theme music playing)
