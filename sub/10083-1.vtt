01:06.458 --> 01:08.833
Janni, Jimmy, get in here now!

01:12.125 --> 01:15.042
I'm so tired of all the fighting.
You have no idea!

01:15.583 --> 01:17.625
- He hit me first.
- He hit me first.

01:17.792 --> 01:19.667
- Liar!
- I don't care who started it.

01:19.958 --> 01:23.000
It has to stop.
I need you two to get along.

01:31.208 --> 01:34.000
You understand that one day...

01:34.542 --> 01:36.792
...you will inherit my empire, yes?

01:37.208 --> 01:40.167
- What's an empire?
- Shut up.

01:40.375 --> 01:45.292
This will remind you that you
are two halves of one.

01:46.625 --> 01:51.625
Together, you are more powerful
than apart. Yes?

01:52.375 --> 01:54.667
What does this mean?

01:54.833 --> 01:58.708
One day, you will find out.

02:22.875 --> 02:25.250
Hey, seÃ±or.

03:18.292 --> 03:20.792
- Freeze!
- Hi, honey.

03:24.625 --> 03:27.333
Just vacuumed this rug, okay?
I got it all even.

03:28.042 --> 03:30.458
Take your shoes off, please.
You know the rule.

03:36.125 --> 03:38.333
Now, please, try not to scare Blanche.

03:38.500 --> 03:42.458
Don't clunk. You're scaring her!
Look, you scared Blanche now, Jill. Jill!

03:42.792 --> 03:44.625
Be done in a minute. Don't go in.

03:44.792 --> 03:47.833
There's a surprise in there! Don't look.

03:48.875 --> 03:50.375
Okay.

03:52.750 --> 03:54.125
Finished it up today.

03:54.292 --> 03:57.583
It's all our favorite hit men.
All our favorite hits.

03:57.750 --> 04:02.333
Now, I don't think you ever met
Tony "The Tooth." Capped him in Chicago.

04:02.500 --> 04:06.000
I even got the hole in his head where
I whacked him with a 9-iron.

04:06.167 --> 04:09.375
Santo "Three Fingers." Remember
the rat that wouldn't shut up?

04:09.542 --> 04:11.500
And, of course, Frankie Figs.

04:12.542 --> 04:14.333
Who could forget Frankie Figs?

04:14.500 --> 04:16.708
"Oh, wow, Jimmy, you shot me."

04:17.833 --> 04:20.166
- Poor Frankie.
- Jimmy.

04:20.333 --> 04:21.958
- What?
- We need to talk.

04:22.208 --> 04:24.000
I mean, I...

04:24.208 --> 04:28.333
I just wanted everything to be perfect
for when the baby came. That's all.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.833
That's what we need to talk about.

04:31.375 --> 04:33.083
So how did the hit go?

04:33.250 --> 04:34.500
- Good.
- Really?

04:36.708 --> 04:38.792
- So you let him get away.
- No!

04:38.958 --> 04:40.333
- Then he's dead?
- Yeah.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.458
- Then what is it?
- I didn't kill him.

04:42.708 --> 04:45.625
- But he is dead.
- At first, everything went smooth.

04:45.875 --> 04:49.333
I did everything you said.
I had the taxi, I had the flowers.

04:50.542 --> 04:53.667
Nobody even notices me.
I could have been invisible.

04:53.833 --> 04:55.500
You have a problem getting in?

04:55.708 --> 04:59.625
Oh, honey, I finally used my lock-pick set!

04:59.792 --> 05:03.000
Like this, I was in there and
I'm waiting and I'm poised...

05:03.208 --> 05:07.125
...I'm cool as a cucumber. All of a sudden,
the frigging guy's phone rings.

05:08.458 --> 05:09.458
You flinched.

05:09.625 --> 05:11.625
- I whip my gun around...
- You flinched!

05:11.792 --> 05:13.833
...and I knock over his tomato sauce.

05:14.042 --> 05:17.000
You must stay focused when
you are killing a person!

05:17.250 --> 05:19.208
Then I've got this whole big mess.

05:19.375 --> 05:21.792
The more I try to clean up,
the worse it gets.

05:21.958 --> 05:25.708
Tomato sauce is a tough stain to get
out. You need a good grease cutter.

05:25.875 --> 05:28.625
Then finally, I hear the
guy's key in the lock.

05:31.208 --> 05:34.125
Now, let me guess:
Your shotgun's out of reach.

05:34.542 --> 05:37.500
So now I gotta think fast.
So I go for my gun...

05:37.667 --> 05:40.667
...he slides across the floor and, well...

05:40.875 --> 05:43.708
I would go into detail, but let's just say...

05:43.875 --> 05:45.625
...he left the building.

05:49.375 --> 05:53.208
I gotta say, if the guy's dead,
we gotta put this in the win column.

05:53.375 --> 05:56.542
Same thing with Spiegelman.
He fell down an elevator shaft.

05:56.708 --> 05:59.833
But you were running right
behind him just before he fell.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.333
But I just wanna shoot someone!

06:11.708 --> 06:14.542
All right, now. All right, now, baby.

06:14.708 --> 06:19.458
Murdering another human being
can be a very moving experience.

06:19.625 --> 06:21.042
Listen.

06:21.208 --> 06:22.875
I got an idea.

06:23.042 --> 06:25.667
What do you say we go and kill
somebody, just us?

06:26.083 --> 06:30.625
We'll find some drunk tourist, take him to
the beach and put three in his coconut.

06:32.333 --> 06:34.000
What's your favorite gun?

06:34.167 --> 06:35.542
- A.45.
- Great.

06:35.708 --> 06:39.000
We'll make a big mess.
How does that sound, baby doll?

06:40.208 --> 06:42.458
My roast.

06:47.708 --> 06:50.250
- This isn't working.
- Oven's working fine, Jill.

06:50.417 --> 06:52.042
No, this, this, Jimmy.

06:52.208 --> 06:54.708
I married a contract killer,
not Martha Stewart.

06:54.875 --> 06:56.667
Hey, I am in disguise, okay?

06:56.833 --> 06:58.875
Yeah, well, your disguise is dumb.

06:59.042 --> 07:00.583
I mean, look at yourself.

07:00.750 --> 07:04.167
And what are you doing in disguise?
Everyone thinks you're dead.

07:04.333 --> 07:06.125
Well, you never can tell, can you?

07:06.292 --> 07:08.417
You are gonna sit and enjoy this meal.

07:08.583 --> 07:11.208
I got this recipe from
Mrs. Sanchez next door.

07:11.375 --> 07:14.833
This is a cilantro reduction.
Hey, watch your fingerprints!

07:15.000 --> 07:18.833
- I spent the whole morning scrubbing.
- There is something wrong with you.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.750
Hey, there is nothing wrong with me.
There is nothing wrong with me.

07:22.917 --> 07:26.000
Every man that has an ongoing
sexual relationship...

07:26.167 --> 07:30.542
...experiences certain peaks and valleys
within his male libido from time to time.

07:30.708 --> 07:35.333
Last time we saw a peak was almost a
year ago, Mr. Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski.

07:35.500 --> 07:38.833
We're in a valley. We're below
sea level. We're under the water.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.708
The Tulip has:

07:42.042 --> 07:43.958
Jimmy the Tulip is alive and well.

07:44.125 --> 07:46.417
I'm not so sure. I saw a doctor in L.A.

07:46.583 --> 07:48.458
This is a cilantro reduction.

07:48.625 --> 07:51.292
You marinate the meat
in tequila for 2 1 /2 hours...

07:51.458 --> 07:53.375
...and it melts...
- Are you listening?

07:53.542 --> 07:54.917
He said it wasn't me.

07:55.542 --> 07:58.958
Jill, please just come eat.
I have been cooking all day.

07:59.167 --> 08:00.958
Jimmy!

08:01.458 --> 08:03.625
You might be shooting blanks.

08:03.792 --> 08:06.708
This is not a dumb disguise.
Now, come eat.

08:39.707 --> 08:41.332
Think fast!

08:44.875 --> 08:47.458
- Strabonitz!
- Papa.

08:47.625 --> 08:50.500
This is the best birthday present
I could ever have.

08:50.667 --> 08:53.958
Come here. My big boy,
giant in the family.

08:54.125 --> 08:58.125
- It's a beautiful day, no?
- Yes.

08:58.542 --> 08:59.792
No?

08:59.958 --> 09:01.250
No.

09:01.542 --> 09:02.792
"No" meaning "yes."

09:02.958 --> 09:05.333
"No" meaning "yes."

09:09.125 --> 09:11.583
- Get in the car, I'm starving!
- All right.

09:11.750 --> 09:14.000
If I don't eat soon, I'll pass out.

09:37.542 --> 09:40.958
Hello, birdie. Tweet, tweet, my friend.
Tweet, tweet.

09:44.208 --> 09:47.875
- Babe, you look hot.
- Oz, knock it off.

09:49.833 --> 09:54.667
Just checking out the gyroscopic swivel pan
mechanism. You know, the new one.

09:54.875 --> 09:58.583
You checked it three times already this
morning. Nobody is coming, Oz.

09:58.792 --> 10:01.583
- Knock it off.
- Okay.

10:31.625 --> 10:33.542
I got it, honey!

10:39.375 --> 10:41.667
- Who sent you?
- Buttercup Scouts of America.

10:41.833 --> 10:43.375
What troop are you with?

10:44.125 --> 10:45.542
- What?
- You heard me.

10:45.708 --> 10:48.000
What's your den mother's name?

10:49.917 --> 10:51.375
Carol?

10:53.208 --> 10:55.917
Jesus, Oz, what the hell are you doing?

10:56.083 --> 10:59.500
- She's a Buttercup Scout.
- I'm not buying this scout routine.

10:59.667 --> 11:02.167
Besides, I think there's
something in her hand.

11:02.375 --> 11:05.417
Cookies. Minty Thins.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.792
This is Ellen Wasserstrom's daughter.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.708
I told her mother
I'd buy cookies from her.

11:16.042 --> 11:17.500
Putz.

11:17.708 --> 11:19.292
- I heard that!
- Jag-off.

11:22.750 --> 11:25.708
Well, that was a close call, huh?

11:26.625 --> 11:29.333
Minty Thins are bad anyway.
They cause staining...

11:29.542 --> 11:32.708
- You've really got to stop this now, Oz.
- I know.

11:32.875 --> 11:37.500
Nobody is coming to get us. They can't
come and get us, because they're all dead.

11:37.708 --> 11:40.333
- Or in jail.
- Right.

11:41.208 --> 11:43.542
If you look at that monitor
one more time...

11:43.708 --> 11:45.208
I'll be taking cold showers?

11:45.375 --> 11:47.333
For starters.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.833
You look very nice in that robe.

12:15.083 --> 12:18.333
This will make you very happy. I think.

12:18.500 --> 12:19.958
You think, huh?

12:20.167 --> 12:22.333
Well, for starters, I hate the color.

12:23.708 --> 12:30.000
So! You are the two that tried to muscle in
on my businesses while I was gone.

12:30.167 --> 12:33.625
- No!
- Tell everyone that Lazlo Gogolak...

12:34.125 --> 12:35.833
...is back in town.

12:41.542 --> 12:44.333
How are they gonna tell
anyone when they're dead?

12:44.542 --> 12:46.125
What?

12:50.625 --> 12:53.125
Come here. I love you, boy.

12:56.042 --> 12:58.833
Don't correct me. As a rule.

13:01.292 --> 13:03.542
- What is that? Give it to me.
- Here, boss.

13:03.708 --> 13:06.833
Oh, another surprise.

13:09.625 --> 13:11.667
That was fun.

13:17.750 --> 13:19.000
Oseransky.

13:19.167 --> 13:21.458
- It's me.
- Oh, hey, Jill, how are you?

13:21.625 --> 13:26.000
- How's your new dental assistant?
- Well, she's not trying to kill me.

13:26.167 --> 13:28.125
Never forget the fun we had.

13:28.292 --> 13:31.458
- Hey, listen. Can I ask you something?
- Sure, anything.

13:31.625 --> 13:33.458
You think Jimmy and Cynthia talk?

13:33.625 --> 13:35.625
What do you mean? Like you and I talk?

13:35.792 --> 13:37.458
No, like, I mean, "talk" talk.

13:37.917 --> 13:41.500
I don't understand. Why would
Jimmy and Cynthia be "talk" talking?

13:41.667 --> 13:44.333
No, Cynthia would tell me.
She tells me everything.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.667
- Why?
- He's acting like a fruitcake.

13:46.833 --> 13:48.750
- What, he's killing people?
- I wish.

13:48.917 --> 13:54.042
No, he's up to something. He's acting like
he's out of his mind, but I don't believe it.

13:54.208 --> 13:57.708
Oh, jeez, a homicidal maniac acting
totally crazy. What a surprise.

13:57.875 --> 14:00.125
- Jill!
- I gotta go, I'll talk to you later.

14:00.292 --> 14:01.292
Yeah?

14:16.792 --> 14:19.500
- So that's the one we're after?
- Yes.

14:19.667 --> 14:24.042
Cost me 1 0,000 to get,
you know, the dental work.

14:24.208 --> 14:26.792
- To find out if it's him.
- Did you save receipts?

14:27.167 --> 14:29.208
- No. What receipts?
- I'm kidding.

14:29.458 --> 14:33.333
Nobody saves receipts anymore.
Don't worry. That's why it's funny.

14:33.542 --> 14:37.875
It's funny. All right, so you go in
and you grab him.

14:38.042 --> 14:40.167
- Yes.
- You go in...

14:40.458 --> 14:41.875
And I...

14:42.042 --> 14:43.417
And grab him.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.167
- What do you do?
- I go in and I grab him.

14:46.375 --> 14:48.167
Piece of pie.

14:48.458 --> 14:50.375
- No, it's "cake."
- What did I say?

14:50.542 --> 14:52.292
- Pie.
- And you said?

14:52.458 --> 14:55.875
- Cake. No, it's pie.
- Piece of pie.

15:00.292 --> 15:02.375
Cake.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.875
Mr. White, how's that implant
treating you?

15:11.167 --> 15:12.667
Okay.

15:12.875 --> 15:17.667
So how are you? How you doing?
You're looking topnotch. Very stellar.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.125
That's a nice sweater.
A burnt orange or...?

15:20.292 --> 15:23.375
Hey, Dr. Oseransky,
your wife's on line one.

15:23.542 --> 15:25.167
- Is she upset?
- You know what...

15:25.375 --> 15:28.083
...I can't tell whether she's
laughing or crying.

15:28.250 --> 15:29.917
I think she might be laughing.

15:30.083 --> 15:32.625
- Okay, well, put her through, okay, Julie?
- Okay.

15:32.792 --> 15:36.333
Here we go. A little nitrous for you.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.667
Now, don't take this off
until I tell you.

15:38.833 --> 15:40.500
You may enjoy that.

15:40.792 --> 15:42.792
- Hi, honey, what's up?
- Got some news.

15:42.958 --> 15:45.375
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. We're pregnant.

15:45.708 --> 15:49.042
What? We're pregnant!

15:49.625 --> 15:51.000
What? When?

15:51.208 --> 15:55.042
- Probably when you were on top of me.
- Or when you were on top of me.

15:55.208 --> 15:57.208
- Doctor.
- Mrs. Himelfarb.

15:57.583 --> 16:00.333
- Don't forget to floss.
- God, Oz, I love you so much.

16:00.542 --> 16:02.792
Oh, I love you too. So you're not angry?

16:02.958 --> 16:04.292
About me being pregnant?

16:04.458 --> 16:07.042
No, about me almost shooting
a scout this morning.

16:07.208 --> 16:08.750
Mrs. Havacamp.

16:08.917 --> 16:11.875
- Forget that. I wanna see you.
- Oh, I wanna see you too.

16:12.042 --> 16:16.583
I gotta go. So I'll meet you at your
favorite place. Okay, I love you.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.250
Mr. White.

16:20.417 --> 16:22.125
I'm so sorry.

16:28.500 --> 16:31.833
I'm gonna bring somebody in
to do that for me. Okay?

16:34.708 --> 16:39.458
He's not breathing. Call whoever deals with
that. I'm going to lunch with Cynthia.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.667
91 1. 91 1 deals with that.

16:43.208 --> 16:45.000
Call 91... Hold on, please.

16:48.542 --> 16:52.167
Why do I have a bad feeling about this?

17:01.250 --> 17:02.958
This can't be good.

17:03.125 --> 17:05.833
- It really is perfect now, isn't it?
- Yes.

17:06.041 --> 17:07.875
- There's so much planning.
- I know.

17:08.041 --> 17:09.833
So many things to buy.

17:10.041 --> 17:11.750
We gotta get a crib, clothes.

17:11.916 --> 17:16.041
- We have to redecorate the guest bedroom.
- I'll finally get to build that moat.

17:16.208 --> 17:17.500
- What?
- Oh, no worries.

17:17.708 --> 17:19.500
I've already checked with zoning.

17:19.666 --> 17:23.000
Are you kidding? We're not building
a fricking moat in our yard.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.291
This will go all around the perimeter.

17:25.458 --> 17:29.167
- Oz, no. Don't ruin this moment.
- I'm not...

17:29.375 --> 17:32.458
We're having a baby. Not now.
I mean, we're fighting now...

17:32.625 --> 17:34.542
...but then we're gonna have a baby.

17:35.875 --> 17:39.333
- Honey, I'm just trying to...
- Drive me insane.

17:40.958 --> 17:45.250
Look, I don't wanna raise a child in an
environment of complete and total fear.

17:45.417 --> 17:48.875
Fear? Who's talking about fear?
We're talking about a moat.

17:49.042 --> 17:52.333
Just think of it as a
little, round swimming pool.

17:52.542 --> 17:55.375
- You're afraid of everything, Oz.
- That is so not true.

18:10.708 --> 18:13.292
- Thinking about me?
- Off and on. Yeah.

18:13.458 --> 18:15.333
See the paper? Well?

18:15.500 --> 18:19.417
- I'm a little nervous about this.
- There's nothing to be nervous about.

18:19.583 --> 18:22.583
- What, is he driving you nuts again?
- Yes.

18:22.792 --> 18:25.625
Sounds like you could use
a break. A little...

18:25.792 --> 18:27.500
- Cahooting?
- I seem to remember...

18:27.708 --> 18:29.833
...you were always good at cahooting.

18:31.333 --> 18:34.125
I remember a time when your
middle name was danger.

18:34.292 --> 18:35.833
Oh, Jimmy.

18:36.042 --> 18:38.375
- Cynthia.
- I hate lying to Oz like this.

18:38.542 --> 18:41.167
Oz can't know anything
about this. Are we clear?

18:41.375 --> 18:43.625
We're clear. Does Jill suspect anything?

18:44.292 --> 18:47.167
- Jill thinks I'm losing my mind.
- She's probably right.

18:47.875 --> 18:50.708
- You still got the numbers, right?
- Of course.

18:53.042 --> 18:55.042
- God.
- What?

18:55.208 --> 18:58.333
You still sound so sexy on the phone.

18:58.542 --> 19:00.792
- Listen, one more thing.
- Yeah?

19:01.500 --> 19:02.833
What are you wearing?

19:04.083 --> 19:05.875
It's not important.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.833
All right, I gotta go.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.792
- Game time.
- Good luck.

19:13.542 --> 19:14.917
You're on.

19:28.958 --> 19:30.167
"Honey, I'm sorry."

19:30.375 --> 19:32.917
"Honey, I'm sorry."

19:35.875 --> 19:38.667
Honey. I'm so sorry.

19:38.833 --> 19:41.917
It's the idiot from under the table.

19:43.208 --> 19:44.958
Honey?

19:45.125 --> 19:47.167
Honey.

19:48.875 --> 19:51.125
She not here.

19:51.375 --> 19:53.292
Oh, my God.

19:58.792 --> 20:01.167
Mr. White, what are you doing here?

20:02.875 --> 20:06.167
If this is about the nitrous oxide
I gave you, I'm sorry.

20:06.333 --> 20:08.333
Dentist, sit down.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.458
Where... Where is my wife?

20:11.625 --> 20:13.375
Your wife...

20:15.167 --> 20:18.125
...is in a safe...
- My wife's in a safe?

20:18.292 --> 20:20.083
Place. Safe place.

20:20.250 --> 20:23.833
Let me finish a sentence.
I talk, you talk, I talk.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.083
- That's how we should have a conversation.
- Okay, yes, good. Whatever you say.

20:28.250 --> 20:33.167
How safe and for how long
is entirely up to you.

20:33.875 --> 20:37.708
Would it be out of line
if I asked at this juncture...

20:38.125 --> 20:41.250
...who you are and what
you're doing in my home?

20:53.708 --> 20:55.833
I'm...

20:57.042 --> 20:59.333
...flabbergasted.

21:00.667 --> 21:02.958
- I'm sorry...
- Chagrined.

21:03.917 --> 21:09.500
That you don't see the similarity
in the facial structure.

21:10.333 --> 21:16.042
- And you guys just understand all of this?
- Do you remember Janni Gogolak?

21:23.667 --> 21:25.333
Do you or don't you?

21:27.417 --> 21:29.125
- What?
- Remember Janni!

21:29.500 --> 21:32.958
- Yes, I remember Janni.
- Janni...

21:37.708 --> 21:39.208
...was my son.

21:39.417 --> 21:42.042
Oh, no, no. No, no, I know
what you're thinking.

21:42.208 --> 21:43.958
- Yes, you do?
- I think I do.

21:44.125 --> 21:46.333
You're like the Amazing Kreskin.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.167
Well, you know all this, where it's going?

21:49.375 --> 21:51.833
No, no, no, no. I just think...

21:55.917 --> 21:59.500
I think that you think I killed
your son. I did not kill your son.

21:59.708 --> 22:02.792
- Jimmy Tudeski killed your son.
- You know, I collect these.

22:04.583 --> 22:06.042
- Really?
- Nope.

22:07.542 --> 22:09.833
- Where is Jimmy?
- Jimmy's dead.

22:10.042 --> 22:12.375
- Jimmy's dead. They're both dead.
- I'm bored.

22:12.542 --> 22:15.958
Strabo, put one in his head.
Maybe that will help him remember.

22:16.125 --> 22:18.125
- Papa...
- lf he puts one in my head...

22:18.292 --> 22:19.750
...how will I remember?
- Shut up!

22:19.917 --> 22:22.583
- I'll try that.
- Where's Jimmy? I know he's alive!

22:22.750 --> 22:27.208
Mr. Gogolak, I don't know where Jimmy is.
Please. As far as I know, he's dead.

22:27.542 --> 22:30.000
- Strabo.
- Strabo. Don't, Mr. White. Strabo!

22:36.708 --> 22:38.042
Enough! Enough!

22:39.458 --> 22:41.708
Are you kidding me? That's loud!

22:43.042 --> 22:45.375
Come on, he's getting away.

22:47.042 --> 22:50.667
Stop, stop. Why are you
shooting in a neighborhood like this?

22:50.875 --> 22:54.625
Let everybody know we're here.
Go next door, show them the weapon.

22:54.792 --> 22:57.000
- What are we gonna do, Papa?
- Relax.

22:57.208 --> 23:00.625
The dentist will lead us to the rat.

23:03.042 --> 23:05.542
It'll be maybe five more minutes.
1 0, maybe.

23:05.708 --> 23:07.958
One second.
Dr. Oseranksy's office.

23:08.167 --> 23:11.500
- Julie, it's Oz!
- Hey, doc. You sound frazzled.

23:11.667 --> 23:14.125
- Are you all right?
- I am frazzled.

23:14.292 --> 23:16.667
Just cancel my appointments for the week.

23:16.875 --> 23:19.708
- You know how many people are here?
- Just cancel them!

23:20.208 --> 23:22.375
- Okay, fine.
- Okay.

23:28.500 --> 23:30.708
I got you.

23:33.208 --> 23:35.500
- That was good one.
- Yeah, yeah.

23:35.750 --> 23:37.750
Yermo, Zevo.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.958
We're driving to Mexico in 1 0 minutes.

23:41.125 --> 23:44.000
Stop drinking or you'll get an IUD.

23:44.583 --> 23:47.167
Cynthia, you have something to eat?

23:48.708 --> 23:50.958
Nice of you to take interest in my health.

23:51.125 --> 23:54.958
- Cynthia, take one. Eat.
- Thank you, Anya.

23:57.875 --> 24:00.875
Mother, Mother, please, please. No.

24:01.042 --> 24:02.833
Not now. It's nice.

24:03.208 --> 24:06.500
- It's tough to eat with all the gas.
- I made it for her.

24:06.667 --> 24:08.042
All right.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.083
She's 1 08.

24:14.250 --> 24:15.500
I love her.

24:15.667 --> 24:20.708
- Let's get Jimmy! Bring around the car.
- I can't believe you think Jimmy's still alive.

24:21.042 --> 24:25.333
You remember how his body was
identified? I do. Dental records.

24:26.708 --> 24:29.125
- So?
- Sit down.

24:29.875 --> 24:32.917
Your husband just happens
to be a dentist.

24:33.083 --> 24:35.667
He and Jimmy are buddy-buddy.

24:36.333 --> 24:38.250
- What's your point?
- Do the math!

24:38.417 --> 24:41.875
Jimmy is still alive and
your husband, again, with him.

24:42.042 --> 24:45.333
- How do you know where my husband is?
- That was simple.

24:45.542 --> 24:47.167
- "LuJack."
- LuJack?

24:47.375 --> 24:49.167
- In the Porsche.
- No, Papa.

24:49.333 --> 24:52.333
It's... You say "LoJack."

24:52.708 --> 24:54.500
See? LoJack.

24:55.250 --> 24:57.333
- I didn't quite hear.
- Oh, LoJack.

24:58.042 --> 24:59.583
Don't correct me.

24:59.792 --> 25:01.167
Don't ever correct me!

25:01.375 --> 25:04.125
You like getting hit?
You're a freak who enjoys pain?

25:04.292 --> 25:06.167
- Of course not.
- Watch the broad!

25:11.375 --> 25:13.458
Do you know how this works?

25:15.167 --> 25:17.042
Thanks, I got it.

25:17.583 --> 25:21.167
Hold still or you're gonna
look like a Hare Krishna.

25:21.875 --> 25:23.750
That's funny.

25:24.083 --> 25:25.417
- Are you okay?
- Am I bleeding?

25:25.583 --> 25:28.500
- No. Hello.
- Jill!

25:28.667 --> 25:30.417
- Who's that?
- I can't talk now.

25:30.583 --> 25:32.833
Who is that? Give me the phone.
Give me...

25:33.000 --> 25:34.958
Give me the phone.

25:36.583 --> 25:38.750
- Who is this?
- Jimmy. Jimmy, hi, it's Oz.

25:38.917 --> 25:42.167
- Oz? How the hell did Oz get our number?
- I don't know.

25:42.375 --> 25:44.750
What did I tell you
about ever calling here?

25:44.917 --> 25:48.167
I think you said something
about killing me...

25:48.375 --> 25:52.750
Yes, killing me and beating me to death
with my own corpse. That's what it was.

25:52.958 --> 25:55.000
Yeah, good memory. What do you want?

25:55.208 --> 25:57.333
- I'm in Mexico.
- You're in Mexico?

25:57.542 --> 25:59.333
I was thinking I would swing by...

25:59.542 --> 26:01.292
If you come by this house, Oz...

26:01.458 --> 26:05.125
...if you come within 25 miles,
I will back a car over your head 75 times.

26:05.375 --> 26:07.375
Okay.

26:08.875 --> 26:10.833
Hi, I'm a dead man.

26:13.208 --> 26:14.833
Good talking to you.

26:15.833 --> 26:19.083
No, no, no. No, no, no.
Stay away from the vehicle.

26:19.250 --> 26:20.958
Get out of the car. Get out.

26:49.667 --> 26:52.333
Jimmy! Jimmy, don't shoot,
it's me, it's Oz!

26:52.500 --> 26:54.167
I know.

26:55.958 --> 26:58.083
That almost hit me.

27:09.292 --> 27:11.292
How you doing?

27:22.917 --> 27:26.917
- Are you wearing bunny slippers?
- Stay away from my chickens, Oz.

27:31.458 --> 27:34.958
Oh, my God. Oh, no. Blanche!

27:35.125 --> 27:37.292
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.292
Blanche!

27:39.458 --> 27:41.167
- Who's Blanche?
- Consuelo!

27:41.375 --> 27:44.667
Xerxes! Alert the others,
there's been a tragedy!

27:45.042 --> 27:46.292
Who's Blanche?

27:46.875 --> 27:48.333
This is Blanche.

27:49.167 --> 27:50.667
- You killed her.
- I'm sorry.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.375
Go home, Oz. Go home before
something bad happens.

27:55.542 --> 27:58.750
Something bad already has happened.
Cynthia's been kidnapped.

27:58.917 --> 28:02.375
Poor Blanche. Cut down in her prime.

28:02.542 --> 28:05.542
He names his chickens.
You name your chickens?

28:08.208 --> 28:10.833
Blanche! You're dead!

28:23.542 --> 28:25.000
Hey, Oz, you're here.

28:26.542 --> 28:27.875
He killed Blanche.

28:28.042 --> 28:31.500
- What are you doing here?
- I'd like to know. What are you doing here?

28:31.667 --> 28:34.167
- Put a sock in it. We talk all the time.
- Jill.

28:34.375 --> 28:36.125
Really. You talk all the time?

28:36.292 --> 28:40.375
We spoke once. And I think it was mostly
about some kind of fruit.

28:40.542 --> 28:41.833
- Are you alone?
- Yeah.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.375
- You weren't followed?
- No.

28:43.542 --> 28:45.792
- How would you know?
- Honey.

28:46.500 --> 28:49.833
Well, now that he's here, he's staying
for lobster Ã¢ la Tudeski.

28:50.042 --> 28:53.458
"Lobster Ã¢ la Tudeski"? I can't stay
for lobster Ã¢ la Tudeski.

28:53.667 --> 28:56.333
- Lazlo Gogolak was at my house.
- Oh, my God.

28:56.542 --> 28:59.000
- Am I setting a place or not?
- Yes, please.

28:59.208 --> 29:02.542
- What is the matter with him?
- It's a long story. Talk to me.

29:02.708 --> 29:04.458
Well, Cynthia's been kidnapped.

29:04.625 --> 29:05.833
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

29:06.042 --> 29:09.667
- Lazlo wants Jimmy's head for killing Janni.
- He came to your house?

29:09.833 --> 29:14.667
Wouldn't this conversation be so much
better dining on my masterpiece?

29:15.583 --> 29:16.875
What's wrong with him?

29:17.042 --> 29:19.333
Are you crazy? Are you out of your mind?

29:19.542 --> 29:21.167
They know you're alive.

29:21.333 --> 29:23.083
- How would they know?
- They do.

29:23.250 --> 29:25.833
Oh, look, honey, we have
a squealer in the house.

29:26.042 --> 29:28.000
A squealer? I'm not a squealer!

29:28.333 --> 29:30.125
I've never squealed on anybody.

29:30.333 --> 29:31.542
How do they know, Oz?

29:31.708 --> 29:34.042
They have Cynthia. I need your help.

29:34.875 --> 29:36.833
- Yeah.
- And I'm your friend.

29:37.208 --> 29:39.917
You know what, Oz?
Friendship is overrated.

29:40.083 --> 29:44.042
I got enough friends. In fact, I'm thinking
about maybe losing a couple.

29:46.542 --> 29:49.375
This could be great. A way
to get back in the game.

29:49.542 --> 29:51.875
Yes, back in the game.

29:52.042 --> 29:55.000
I don't wish to get back in the game.
I like cooking.

29:55.167 --> 29:57.542
I like cleaning. And I like to decorate.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.333
- We're talking about Cynthia here.
- Yes, Cynthia. Your ex-wife?

30:02.542 --> 30:05.167
"Ex" would be the key word
in that sentence, Oz.

30:05.333 --> 30:08.083
If you don't get off your ass
and help get Cynthia...

30:08.250 --> 30:10.042
...I'll never talk to you again.

30:10.208 --> 30:13.958
If you ever grab me like that again,
I will stick a knife in your face.

30:14.125 --> 30:15.542
Is that clear?

30:15.708 --> 30:18.000
We'll talk about it over dinner...

30:18.167 --> 30:21.000
...which is probably ruined.
Go wash your hands.

30:21.208 --> 30:22.500
We eat in 1 5 minutes.

30:26.583 --> 30:28.458
He's kidding.

30:29.042 --> 30:31.542
You better go wash your hands, Oz.

30:50.208 --> 30:52.292
Well, it really is a nice presentation.

30:52.458 --> 30:55.375
It would have been,
if we hadn't let the sauce clot.

30:55.667 --> 31:01.333
The potatoes were supposed to be floating
around the lobster, not just stuck like that.

31:01.542 --> 31:03.500
I had this tricolore thing going on.

31:03.667 --> 31:04.875
It looks great.

31:05.042 --> 31:08.667
I would hate to think you were
placating me to talk about Cynthia.

31:09.208 --> 31:11.333
No. No.

31:15.958 --> 31:17.833
- Is that Hebrew?
- Yeah.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.792
- Aren't you Catholic?
- Yeah. Devout.

31:20.083 --> 31:22.042
- That makes sense.
- Oz...

31:22.208 --> 31:24.417
...give us the lowdown on Cynthia.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.000
She's pregnant.

31:26.208 --> 31:28.667
Oh, my God! That's so great!

31:28.833 --> 31:31.292
Thanks. The funny thing is,
we weren't trying.

31:31.792 --> 31:33.625
Oh, my God, that's great.

31:34.083 --> 31:38.333
- Any idea where they're keeping her?
- With Lazlo. What's the matter with him?

31:38.958 --> 31:42.833
Nothing, don't worry. This is just
his way of expressing joy lately.

31:43.083 --> 31:46.042
Oh, so this is how a
retired mass murderer acts.

31:46.208 --> 31:50.833
This is how a retired mass murderer behaves
when people show up uninvited for dinner!

31:51.042 --> 31:53.000
- Noted.
- Jimmy.

31:57.042 --> 32:01.792
- How many goons does he have with him?
- Seven, eight.

32:02.208 --> 32:03.833
- And his son.
- Strabonitz?

32:06.208 --> 32:08.333
Well, should I go to the police?

32:08.542 --> 32:11.083
Kidnapping would put him away forever.

32:11.250 --> 32:14.625
He'd make her disappear to avoid
going back to the slammer.

32:14.792 --> 32:16.208
Why are you asking me?

32:16.375 --> 32:19.000
- This is Oz's problem.
- Jimmy.

32:19.208 --> 32:20.708
You have to help me.

32:20.875 --> 32:24.167
What, are you nuts? I got
a great thing going on down here, Oz.

32:24.375 --> 32:26.042
Plus, I'm safe down here.

32:26.208 --> 32:29.250
Besides, I don't care what happens
with you and Cynthia.

32:29.417 --> 32:32.167
I'm not uprooting my life
to save your sorry ass.

32:36.250 --> 32:38.042
Light it up like a piÃ±ata!

32:38.792 --> 32:41.167
You told them where I live?
You're dead.

32:41.333 --> 32:43.667
Told them where I live.
You're a dead man.

32:51.417 --> 32:56.292
- Jimmy, are you coming or not?!
- You can run, but you can't hide!

32:58.375 --> 32:59.667
Let's go!

33:00.292 --> 33:03.000
Oz! Oz.

33:04.375 --> 33:06.250
Put the...
Let's go!

33:08.625 --> 33:10.042
You better run, tooth-boy.

33:10.208 --> 33:12.958
I get a second, I'm gonna slice you up.

33:13.125 --> 33:16.000
Anyone hit anything yet?

33:19.833 --> 33:21.333
Let's go.

33:29.917 --> 33:31.333
Will you come on?

33:31.708 --> 33:33.542
This idiot. Will you come on?

33:36.375 --> 33:37.958
Get up!

33:38.708 --> 33:40.167
Go!

33:44.208 --> 33:46.500
They're getting away!

33:49.208 --> 33:50.750
Come on!

33:53.708 --> 33:57.542
You're shooting at the house,
they're in the car. You had one shot.

33:58.333 --> 34:01.208
All right, it was a nice shot.
It was. Come here.

34:01.375 --> 34:03.667
It was a nice shot.

34:09.542 --> 34:11.333
Nice shooting, honey.

34:11.542 --> 34:13.208
Thanks, honey.

34:13.500 --> 34:16.250
The sons of batches got away.

34:16.792 --> 34:19.417
So do I clip her or not?

34:19.583 --> 34:23.750
Keep Cynthia happy for the time being.
Can you do that?

34:24.833 --> 34:26.083
Not likely.

34:32.417 --> 34:34.167
Sick bastards!

34:37.708 --> 34:40.667
What?! What is it? What?

34:43.208 --> 34:44.708
Janni.

34:44.875 --> 34:47.292
I want him dead.

34:47.542 --> 34:49.375
Dead!

34:50.708 --> 34:52.792
Yesterday!

34:52.958 --> 34:55.167
Before breakfast!

34:55.333 --> 34:58.000
Before eggs!

34:59.708 --> 35:01.333
Scrambled.

35:11.083 --> 35:13.125
I don't understand why
we have to dump my car.

35:13.333 --> 35:15.000
It's not your business
to understand.

35:15.208 --> 35:18.042
It's not my business to leave
my $80,000 car in Mexico.

35:18.208 --> 35:21.417
Maybe you got a plan there.
Take the car, lose the wife.

35:21.583 --> 35:23.333
- Good plan.
- I'll get the tickets.

35:23.542 --> 35:25.167
You do that, you squealer.

35:25.333 --> 35:29.000
- I didn't squeal on anybody.
- The Gogolaks showed up on their own?

35:29.208 --> 35:32.625
- Forget it, Jill.
- It means he's a rat and a liar.

35:32.792 --> 35:35.333
You married someone in the
witness protection program.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.458
You got a really funny way...

35:37.625 --> 35:40.500
...of asking for help, squeal cheese!

35:41.042 --> 35:43.667
- Please help me?
- Well, that's a little better.

35:43.917 --> 35:47.458
But it still doesn't help, now that
the bad guys know where I live.

35:47.667 --> 35:52.833
- You're spitting in my mouth.
- Just go and get the tickets, squeal weasel!

35:54.250 --> 35:56.542
- How was that?
- It was good.

35:56.708 --> 35:59.292
- Scary.
- Really?

35:59.458 --> 36:01.292
Come here.

36:18.417 --> 36:22.625
So, Oz, congratulations
on Cynthia being pregnant.

36:22.792 --> 36:24.667
Thank you.

36:28.625 --> 36:31.125
You think I'd be a good father?

36:32.625 --> 36:35.000
- You don't think I'd be a good father?
- I didn't say that.

36:35.167 --> 36:36.417
You didn't say anything.

36:36.583 --> 36:39.000
No, I think you'd be a good father.

36:39.167 --> 36:42.292
- I didn't understand what you were...
- Shut up.

36:42.458 --> 36:46.458
- Why are we on this bus?
- Your car's got a GPS system on it.

36:46.667 --> 36:49.458
I figure that's how Lazlo
tracked you down.

36:49.625 --> 36:52.625
- That's what I'm hoping, for your sake.
- For my sake?

36:52.833 --> 36:55.417
Yeah. Because if that's not the case...

36:55.583 --> 36:57.292
...I'm gonna kill you.

36:57.458 --> 37:00.333
- Right, baby?
- Yes, sirree, Bob.

37:01.042 --> 37:04.875
- I wish Cynthia got kidnapped more often.
- Me too.

37:07.375 --> 37:11.500
I'll just put my wife in danger whenever
you guys have problems in the bedroom.

37:11.708 --> 37:13.833
What problems? What problems?

37:14.042 --> 37:15.667
I didn't say anything.

37:15.875 --> 37:19.167
Is this what you two talk about
on the phone behind my back?

37:19.667 --> 37:23.583
How would you like it if I talked to Cynthia
behind your back? Sit down.

37:23.750 --> 37:26.917
- You're causing a scene.
- You grabbed my face.

37:27.542 --> 37:30.167
The front part of my head.

37:40.125 --> 37:41.375
Yes?

37:41.542 --> 37:43.792
He bought three one-way tickets to L.A.

37:43.958 --> 37:47.208
Los Angeles? Interesting.

37:47.375 --> 37:50.208
All right, so we cut them off at the piss.

37:50.375 --> 37:53.917
Just like John Wayne,
we ride up over the hill.

37:54.542 --> 37:56.500
You two in the Porsche. All right?

37:56.667 --> 38:01.167
When we get to L.A., we strip it,
make a few dollars and then torch it.

38:01.375 --> 38:05.542
But for now, you hot-wire it
and follow us. All right? Come on.

38:12.583 --> 38:16.208
- Can we stop the horseplay for one second?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

38:21.458 --> 38:24.708
Okay, so we had a car. My car.
My $80,000 car.

38:24.875 --> 38:28.208
Then we're on a bus.
And now we're renting a car.

38:28.375 --> 38:29.875
This doesn't make any sense.

38:30.042 --> 38:31.333
- It will.
- I ordered...

38:31.542 --> 38:35.458
...a black cup of coffee, all right?
A black cup of coffee.

38:35.625 --> 38:37.292
I screwed up. I apologize.

38:37.458 --> 38:42.292
Well, do I have to wait another 20 minutes
for your screwup? A black cup of coffee.

38:42.458 --> 38:45.250
- I'll get a fresh cup.
- You're still standing there.

38:45.417 --> 38:46.875
- You're still standing.
- I apologize.

38:47.042 --> 38:48.333
Bye.

38:51.083 --> 38:52.417
Hey, pal?

38:53.042 --> 38:56.583
Why don't you give the girl a break.
She already said she was sorry.

38:56.750 --> 39:00.042
- She's just working for a living.
- Right.

39:00.208 --> 39:03.625
Why don't you mind your own business.

39:06.167 --> 39:08.333
- Asshole.
- Oh, no.

39:12.708 --> 39:15.042
Where was I?
I was just gonna remind you...

39:24.458 --> 39:27.833
Now, son, you're never gonna be
as mean or rude...

39:28.042 --> 39:32.708
...to a waitress or anybody that brings you
food like your dad just was, are you, son?

39:32.875 --> 39:35.375
- No.
- Real good.

39:35.542 --> 39:39.333
Eat all your corn. Grow up to be big
and strong like your Uncle Jimmy.

39:40.917 --> 39:43.417
You see, Oz? I'd be a great father.

39:43.583 --> 39:47.042
I just taught that kid
not to be mean to waitresses.

39:51.708 --> 39:55.083
You know, we could
make this a real party.

39:55.250 --> 39:59.250
- What, we need more balloons?
- Oh, Strabo.

39:59.417 --> 40:01.458
I love your name.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.167
No, Strabo, I mean, you and me...

40:05.375 --> 40:07.792
...well, we could make this, you know...

40:07.958 --> 40:09.458
...a fun party.

40:09.667 --> 40:13.875
- Oh, you mean you and me...
- That's right.

40:14.083 --> 40:17.833
- I've always had a little crush on you.
- I've always sensed that.

40:18.042 --> 40:20.625
- You did?
- Yes.

40:20.792 --> 40:26.417
- I guess Jimmy just moved a little quicker?
- Well, Jimmy is as good as...

40:26.583 --> 40:28.375
And so you and the dentist...

40:28.542 --> 40:31.625
Things not so well going?

40:31.792 --> 40:33.833
To tell you the truth...

40:34.833 --> 40:37.167
...I kind of miss the excitement.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.792
And I like your hair that way.

40:42.958 --> 40:45.542
- Long.
- You're making me blush.

40:45.708 --> 40:48.125
That's good.

40:52.042 --> 40:55.375
Give me one good reason to trust you.

40:55.542 --> 40:58.333
- Well, I can give 280 million.
- What?

40:58.542 --> 41:01.958
- What are you talking about?
- Your father never told you?

41:02.125 --> 41:03.625
What?

41:03.833 --> 41:05.750
What's so funny?

41:06.375 --> 41:08.875
What's so goddamn funny?

41:09.375 --> 41:11.375
Strabo.

41:11.542 --> 41:13.542
Your daddy thinks you're a moron.

41:16.208 --> 41:18.625
- Anya!
- Coming.

41:18.792 --> 41:21.667
Anya, you watch the broad.

41:21.875 --> 41:24.333
- Where you going?
- I'm going to the bus station.

41:24.542 --> 41:26.708
- Find Papa.
- My God.

41:39.125 --> 41:41.167
Anya, can I use your bathroom?

41:41.375 --> 41:42.708
Yes.

41:45.917 --> 41:49.708
All right, I got your cream cheese
and scrambled egg.

41:50.417 --> 41:53.833
- That leaves you with the tuna.
- I don't like tuna.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.125
- Start liking it.
- Okay.

41:57.917 --> 42:00.417
I thought of a reason
why you don't have to kill me.

42:00.583 --> 42:02.083
What would that be, dentist?

42:02.250 --> 42:06.125
What if they didn't trace me through my car?
That's a hell of a thing to hang my life on.

42:06.292 --> 42:09.750
- Only thing to hang your life on is trust.
- You want mustard?

42:09.917 --> 42:11.458
Yes, honey, thank you.

42:16.292 --> 42:18.875
What, no Jewish prayer
before our ham and cheese?

42:19.042 --> 42:21.833
You got a problem
with my religiosity, Oz?

42:22.708 --> 42:25.750
Do unto others before you're
turned into a pillar of salt.

42:25.917 --> 42:28.000
Exactly. Unless they're a rat.

42:28.208 --> 42:30.542
Then you can shoot them in the eyes.

42:30.708 --> 42:33.708
- A pillar of salt?
- That's right. Moses said that.

42:33.875 --> 42:35.458
Read the Bible, Oz.

42:36.958 --> 42:39.667
Eat up, dentist.
It could be your last meal.

42:39.875 --> 42:42.875
If they don't show up,
you're gonna shoot me? Is that it?

42:43.042 --> 42:45.583
- That's the size of it.
- And let Cynthia die too?

42:45.750 --> 42:48.833
I told you before, I don't care
what happens to Cynthia.

42:49.042 --> 42:53.250
Oh, yeah, sure. That's why you're still
wearing her crucifix around your neck.

42:53.417 --> 42:55.333
No, wait. I'm sorry, what?

42:55.542 --> 42:58.875
- What did you say was Cynthia's?
- Did I say something?

43:01.917 --> 43:04.708
Two years we've been together
and you never mention...

43:04.875 --> 43:08.292
...you wear a present from your ex-wife?
- It wasn't a present.

43:08.458 --> 43:10.208
- Where's it from?
- I don't know.

43:10.375 --> 43:14.500
It's Cynthia's. Her grandmother gave it
to her and she gave it to Jimmy.

43:14.708 --> 43:17.167
You say you're not a squealer?!

43:20.667 --> 43:22.792
Looks like you got a reprieve, Oz.

43:25.875 --> 43:28.833
Oh, thank God the killers are here.

43:30.833 --> 43:33.542
So check the bus?

43:33.708 --> 43:35.792
As opposed to...

43:36.542 --> 43:40.458
...just looking at the bus?
Yes, check the bus!

43:41.208 --> 43:44.042
Let me out of here. Hey!

43:51.375 --> 43:54.042
Let me out of here.

44:00.708 --> 44:02.583
Come on. Open the door.

44:09.250 --> 44:12.500
Perfect. Right on time.

44:12.708 --> 44:15.208
Your wife's as good as home, Oz.

44:18.208 --> 44:19.542
I know you're in here.

44:40.875 --> 44:43.917
- Looking for me, Strabo?
- Oh, shit.

44:44.083 --> 44:48.500
Anything tricky, I blow your ribs
across the parking lot. Let's go.

44:48.667 --> 44:50.833
- The rat's not here.
- Not here.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.875
The Jimmy...

44:53.708 --> 44:58.000
...is watching me right now. I can feel it.

45:00.667 --> 45:02.292
Hey, Lazlo.

45:02.458 --> 45:05.375
- No, no, no.
- Look what I got.

45:05.542 --> 45:09.000
- I'm sorry, Papa.
- Man, did you get old.

45:09.167 --> 45:14.125
- I like the whole Liberace thing, though.
- How long you think you can hide from me?

45:14.333 --> 45:16.333
Where are you going with this?

45:16.542 --> 45:20.167
I'll call you to tell you where we'll
make the exchange with Cynthia.

45:20.333 --> 45:24.208
Any of your knuckleheads follow this car,
I start throwing out body parts.

45:24.375 --> 45:26.208
Feet first.

45:26.375 --> 45:27.833
You harm...

45:28.042 --> 45:31.208
...one hair on his head...

45:31.708 --> 45:34.667
If they have Strabo, who has girl?

45:40.958 --> 45:42.792
Answer. Answer, Mother.

46:03.542 --> 46:05.333
You okay, darling?

46:11.958 --> 46:14.167
- What's up, Jill?
- Nothing.

46:19.333 --> 46:22.375
Open the trunk.
Don't even think about it.

46:26.708 --> 46:28.375
Thank you.

46:29.542 --> 46:33.125
- I think you nicked his head there.
- I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

46:33.292 --> 46:35.292
- What is your problem, Jill?
- Nothing.

46:35.500 --> 46:38.042
- I don't have a problem.
- Good.

46:38.208 --> 46:40.917
Why don't you go and check us in.

46:41.083 --> 46:43.167
Okay.

46:46.875 --> 46:49.875
I wouldn't mind you wearing it,
it's just so ugly.

46:50.083 --> 46:52.083
- Just throw it away.
- I can't.

46:52.250 --> 46:55.000
- You still have feelings for her?
- It's sacrilegious.

46:55.208 --> 46:59.375
- Why not give it back to her?
- I haven't seen her since my nickel in Joliet!

46:59.875 --> 47:02.542
Where does he get sayings like that?

47:03.875 --> 47:05.833
We aren't gonna talk much, are we?

47:06.042 --> 47:08.667
There is something
really wrong with you, Jill.

47:08.875 --> 47:12.125
- You're still in love with her.
- That's insane. Isn't it?

47:17.542 --> 47:20.125
- Why don't you let me take it...
- Tell you what:

47:20.292 --> 47:23.458
- Jimmy, Jimmy.
- I love you, Jill.

47:24.083 --> 47:27.458
But if you touch this crucifix,
I'll kill you. That's a promise.

47:28.708 --> 47:31.167
This is my good luck charm.

47:32.042 --> 47:34.125
I take it off, I'm jinxed.

47:34.333 --> 47:36.167
Wanna see me dead, Jill?

47:37.833 --> 47:39.417
Do you?

47:39.750 --> 47:42.167
Sometimes, yeah.

47:46.042 --> 47:48.667
- I'm going to check in.
- Can you believe this?

47:48.875 --> 47:53.917
- Well, 47 percent of couples at some point...
- You know, you've got a very long face.

47:54.083 --> 47:55.958
Like a goldfish...

47:56.125 --> 47:59.250
...or a Shetland pony or something.
- Bring Strabo, Oz.

47:59.708 --> 48:02.333
I gotta have you...

48:15.667 --> 48:17.042
Where is she?

48:17.292 --> 48:21.292
Look, how nice. Everybody is still here...

48:21.458 --> 48:24.667
...having a little repast. Isn't that lovely?

48:24.875 --> 48:27.042
Where else would I be?

48:27.625 --> 48:29.250
I don't know.

48:29.417 --> 48:32.042
One would venture a guess.

48:32.208 --> 48:36.333
A question could be asked:
Where have you been?

48:37.000 --> 48:39.333
Big loft, very drafty. I understand.

48:39.583 --> 48:42.458
Get me Figueroa on the phone!

48:42.625 --> 48:44.792
Mr. G., Frankie Figs is dead.

48:45.833 --> 48:50.167
How sad for him.
Try calling the one who's still alive!

48:57.792 --> 49:00.667
Jill. Come on, open the door.

49:00.875 --> 49:02.333
Jill!

49:03.833 --> 49:06.833
Jill, will you come on? Be sensible.

49:07.042 --> 49:09.083
Apologize.

49:09.917 --> 49:13.292
Jill, honey, I'm sorry
I pointed a gun at your face...

49:13.458 --> 49:16.083
...and said I was gonna
blow your brains out.

49:16.250 --> 49:18.458
Okay? I didn't mean that.

49:18.625 --> 49:22.333
- Come on, knock it off.
- I will when you get rid of that crucifix.

49:22.542 --> 49:25.500
This cross represents my Lord and Savior.

49:25.667 --> 49:27.833
The baby in the manger.
I throw it away...

49:28.000 --> 49:31.292
...I go to hell!
- Coming from a man who's killed 21 people.

49:31.458 --> 49:34.458
- Twenty-one? That's impressive.
- It is, isn't it?

49:34.667 --> 49:39.250
Two years, I've been begging you to go
back to work. Cynthia gets kidnapped...

49:39.417 --> 49:41.542
...you're off to the races!

49:45.708 --> 49:47.417
Off to the races?

49:48.208 --> 49:50.417
"Apologize, then she'll come right out."

49:50.583 --> 49:53.333
Squeal bag! Squealster!

49:53.708 --> 49:55.750
Remington Squeal!

49:55.917 --> 49:59.667
See what you got me into? Get over here
and you help me out of this jam.

49:59.875 --> 50:01.917
You better make it good.

50:03.333 --> 50:05.458
Snoodster? Hon?

50:05.625 --> 50:08.167
You're gonna be hearing
from somebody else now.

50:08.375 --> 50:10.458
Jill? Scooster?

50:10.625 --> 50:12.583
Snoodster.

50:13.458 --> 50:17.542
I think you're being a little unreasonable.
When he pulled a gun on you...

50:17.708 --> 50:20.000
...that was pretty funny.

50:20.167 --> 50:22.333
Oz, nobody's talking to you.

50:22.542 --> 50:25.083
Hey, you take it easy on Oz, okay?
He's a doctor.

50:25.250 --> 50:29.792
- People see him when they have problems.
- People see him when they have plaque.

50:30.292 --> 50:32.833
- He's a wonderful dentist.
- Pipe it, toughie.

50:33.000 --> 50:37.542
I promise I'll shoot you. Frankly, I don't care
whether we get Cynthia back or not.

50:37.708 --> 50:39.792
Well, that's a bad...

50:40.292 --> 50:43.208
- Oh, trouble in the bedroom?
- What'd you just say?

50:43.375 --> 50:45.667
- Nothing.
- Excuse me, please.

50:46.917 --> 50:50.125
Did you tell him that?!
Did you tell him that, Jill?!

50:51.208 --> 50:54.417
A few moments of erectile dysfunction...
Just a few, really.

50:54.583 --> 50:57.583
- And I'm not a man now? Is that it?
- Stop kicking.

50:57.750 --> 51:00.125
If you didn't love her, you'd take it off.

51:01.083 --> 51:04.083
- Is that it?!
- Excuse me.

51:04.250 --> 51:07.292
Can we please call Lazlo
and make the switch for Cynthia?

51:07.458 --> 51:09.500
No. I'll tell you why we can't do that!

51:09.708 --> 51:14.625
Because that would involve me talking to
my wife, which I am never gonna do again!

51:14.792 --> 51:16.625
I'm going to get drunk.

51:20.792 --> 51:23.208
- You believe this?
- Well, erectile dysfunc...

51:23.375 --> 51:25.958
Shut up. I'm gonna
go get Jimmy. Will you...

51:26.125 --> 51:29.250
...watch Strabo for a while?
- Eat shit.

51:29.417 --> 51:32.375
How can he get drunk at a time like this?

51:37.250 --> 51:42.125
Maybe this whole "erectile misfiring"
is God's way of punishing me.

51:42.292 --> 51:44.417
He sees all things great and small.

51:44.583 --> 51:48.542
You know, I've done
some very bad things. I lie to Jill.

51:48.708 --> 51:51.083
I don't take the trash out.

51:51.333 --> 51:54.417
- I killed 21 people.
- Actually, 22.

51:54.583 --> 51:56.250
- Who'd I forget?
- Frankie Figs.

52:00.333 --> 52:04.292
This is it. This is the reason that God
does not want me to father a child.

52:04.458 --> 52:08.208
He does not want me to spread my seed.

52:08.583 --> 52:13.292
God is counting my seed, Oz.
He's probably up in heaven right now...

52:13.458 --> 52:18.000
...counting my little seeds. 1 38, 1 39...

52:18.208 --> 52:21.167
...1 40...
- Stop, stop! Stop counting your seed.

52:21.375 --> 52:24.917
I don't think God is keeping an eye
on your sperm.

52:25.083 --> 52:29.167
What kind of a job is that for God?
It'd take him all day. I'm gonna throw up.

52:29.375 --> 52:32.167
Fine. Throw up.
Go ahead, you have your fun.

52:32.375 --> 52:35.208
- What about me?
- Why don't you just consider adopting?

52:35.375 --> 52:37.042
Come on, Oz.

52:37.208 --> 52:41.167
How many adoption agencies
are gonna give a kid to a professional killer?

52:41.375 --> 52:45.000
- You may have a point there.
- Maybe I could just steal a kid.

52:45.167 --> 52:47.375
They're small. How hard can that be?

52:47.542 --> 52:49.875
That's the thinking
you gotta get away from.

52:50.042 --> 52:53.333
But I'd be a great father, Oz.
I would. I'd be a great dad.

52:53.542 --> 52:55.708
I'd teach the kid how to play baseball.

52:55.875 --> 52:58.083
- I've always been good with a bat.
- True.

52:58.250 --> 53:02.000
And, I mean, when I was kid,
I had this cool little slingshot, right?

53:02.167 --> 53:06.083
And I could make a slingshot
for my little boy.

53:06.250 --> 53:10.250
And I could teach him how to use it.
And if he couldn't get it right away...

53:10.417 --> 53:14.958
...I'd be patient. I wouldn't yell at him.
I wouldn't make him cry.

53:23.542 --> 53:26.333
Jimmy, there's a lot of people looking.

53:33.250 --> 53:35.458
Things with the husband
not so well going?

53:38.208 --> 53:39.708
I was thinking...

53:39.875 --> 53:44.208
...if you were to have sex
with another man...

53:44.375 --> 53:46.708
...it would make Jimmy jealous.

53:50.292 --> 53:52.125
Oh, yeah?

53:52.458 --> 53:56.000
- Like with who?
- Well, let's say...

53:57.333 --> 54:00.083
...with me, for example.

54:06.792 --> 54:08.333
You look good with a gun.

54:13.208 --> 54:16.208
Did you have a good relationship
with your father, Oz?

54:16.375 --> 54:19.000
- We were like pals.
- Like to kill my father.

54:19.208 --> 54:22.250
Like to take an ice pick
and stick it right in his eyeball.

54:22.417 --> 54:24.458
Still wanna throw up.

54:25.125 --> 54:28.042
Can you help me?
Can you tell me? I mean, what the...?

54:28.208 --> 54:30.458
What the hell is going on here?!

54:30.625 --> 54:34.458
Why are we all on this big,
spinning ball that we call Earth?!

54:34.625 --> 54:37.542
Why? Why?

54:38.042 --> 54:41.708
You ever hear of avoidance behavior?
I don't wanna talk about that...

54:41.875 --> 54:45.375
Let's talk about avoidance behavior.
Like sitting here in a bar...

54:45.542 --> 54:49.167
...drinking shots instead of saving Cynthia?
- She'll be fine, Oz.

54:49.375 --> 54:51.833
- What do you mean?
- I'll tell you one thing:

54:52.042 --> 54:55.542
I am not gonna go out there
and risk my ass for my wife...

54:55.708 --> 54:57.875
- My wife!
- Whatever!

54:58.042 --> 55:00.917
I'm not risking my ass before I get
a few things off my chest.

55:01.083 --> 55:04.292
Fine. Say them. What do you wanna say?

55:07.000 --> 55:10.333
- You know I was a bed wetter?
- You don't do it anymore, do you?

55:10.500 --> 55:12.542
At 1 2, I saw my dad
naked in the shower.

55:12.708 --> 55:16.833
Well, that's probably why you wet the bed.
Very Freudian. Jungian.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.625
- We had some great times.
- You and your father?

55:19.792 --> 55:21.458
No! Me and Cynthia!

55:22.833 --> 55:26.208
- That's almost vomit.
- What was it like when Cynthia told you...

55:26.375 --> 55:30.125
...she was pregnant?
- Oh, well, that was a beautiful moment.

55:31.833 --> 55:34.750
- She's got a great rack, doesn't she?
- I'm sorry?

55:34.917 --> 55:36.792
I mean, she was so wild.

55:36.958 --> 55:39.500
So wild. I mean...

55:39.667 --> 55:43.042
...one time we wrecked
an entire suite at the Hotel Drake.

55:43.208 --> 55:47.792
- Seven thousand dollars' worth of damage.
- Let's stop talking about you and my wife.

55:47.958 --> 55:51.292
I mean, we didn't
come out of the room for four days.

55:51.458 --> 55:53.667
But I don't gotta tell you, do I?

55:53.875 --> 55:57.042
You're married to her,
you lucky son of a bitch.

55:57.833 --> 56:00.292
- What is this thing?
- What we've been building.

56:00.458 --> 56:01.792
- Get it out of here!
- Why?

56:01.958 --> 56:04.958
Because I hate it!
It makes me sad.

56:07.958 --> 56:09.792
What's happening?

56:09.958 --> 56:12.708
What's happening now?
Where are you going now?

56:23.375 --> 56:24.875
Check.

56:42.125 --> 56:43.917
Good morning...

56:56.875 --> 56:58.667
What the hell is this?

56:58.833 --> 57:02.000
Just give me five more minutes, baby.

57:08.958 --> 57:12.125
You are really noisy in the morning.

57:12.542 --> 57:15.667
Jimmy, what the hell happened
last night?

57:17.500 --> 57:19.792
And why does my ass hurt?

57:20.375 --> 57:24.458
- You fell down the stairs.
- Oh, good. So nothing happened.

57:24.625 --> 57:27.792
Of course not. Not really.

57:28.625 --> 57:31.500
- What does that mean?
- We were just a couple of guys...

57:31.667 --> 57:35.667
...helping each other out. That's all.
- I'm sorry, but what does that mean?

57:35.833 --> 57:38.875
It was a really magical night, Oz.
Don't ruin it.

57:40.708 --> 57:42.167
- What is it now?
- That thing.

57:42.333 --> 57:44.333
- Oh, this?
- I knew it.

57:44.542 --> 57:47.500
- Oh, my God.
- You guys enjoy your slumber party?

57:47.667 --> 57:50.333
This is not what it looks like. Right?

57:50.500 --> 57:52.708
- Where's Strabo?
- He got away.

57:54.333 --> 57:58.208
- I'm kidding. He's right here.
- Okay, well, I'm gonna put some clothes on.

57:58.375 --> 58:00.875
- You want some help?
- I think I'm fine. Thank...

58:04.750 --> 58:07.708
- A little male bonding?
- Just like C block, huh, Strabo?

58:07.875 --> 58:10.458
I fell down the stairs, Strabo.

58:10.917 --> 58:13.083
Going out to get some coffee.

58:15.333 --> 58:17.750
I should probably
put some clothes on first.

58:17.917 --> 58:19.250
Yeah.

58:31.792 --> 58:36.000
- Hey, Oz, can you come in here for a sec?
- Yes.

58:38.958 --> 58:41.417
Listen, that was not what you...

58:42.125 --> 58:44.042
Let me close that.

58:45.875 --> 58:47.875
Why are you bottomless?

58:48.042 --> 58:50.292
I hated that skirt.

58:54.750 --> 58:57.625
- You don't like that shirt too?
- Came with the skirt.

58:57.792 --> 59:00.125
I see. I mean, I really see.

59:09.250 --> 59:11.208
What are you doing?

59:15.667 --> 59:17.583
Oz.

59:18.292 --> 59:20.583
You like my perfume? Smell it.

59:22.083 --> 59:26.000
- I've been a little stuffed up, feeling nasally.
- Smell it.

59:28.750 --> 59:31.917
Yes. Yes, I do.
It's...

59:33.542 --> 59:35.708
You like my bra?

59:38.000 --> 59:41.458
This... Here it is. It's a purple shirt.

59:44.333 --> 59:46.750
- Give me your hand.
- What are you gonna do...

59:46.917 --> 59:48.542
Give it!

59:51.125 --> 59:52.958
Feel my heart.

59:53.208 --> 59:55.083
I don't think that's your heart.

59:55.250 --> 59:59.250
Isn't your heart in between all that?

59:59.417 --> 01:00:01.917
My heart is broken.

01:00:03.208 --> 01:00:04.458
Can you feel that?

01:00:09.667 --> 01:00:12.250
Yes. Yes, I do. Yes, I...

01:00:12.625 --> 01:00:15.333
It's so broken, Oz!

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.500
- Jill!
- Oz!

01:00:17.708 --> 01:00:20.750
- I'm so sad. Oz!
- Don't be sad.

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:23.500
What's all this?

01:00:25.625 --> 01:00:28.625
First my ex-wife and now my wife-wife.

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:31.042
No, no, no. She just hated her outfit.

01:00:33.167 --> 01:00:35.833
- He wants to talk to you for a second.
- No, you.

01:00:46.875 --> 01:00:49.917
I've been waiting a long time for this, Oz.

01:00:50.167 --> 01:00:54.458
Oz? I think Oz is gonna be out
for a good half-hour, 45 minutes, Jill.

01:00:57.875 --> 01:00:59.708
I didn't... I just...

01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:03.125
Jimmy, I...

01:01:07.583 --> 01:01:10.125
You do love me, don't you?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.292
Up on your toes. Stand up.
Come on, tippy-time, tippy-time.

01:01:29.458 --> 01:01:32.208
- Why can't I stay in here?
- There you go. Sit down.

01:01:32.375 --> 01:01:34.750
Read a nice book.

01:01:39.667 --> 01:01:41.500
Oh, God!

01:01:41.667 --> 01:01:44.083
- Yeah, baby!
- That feels so good!

01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:47.000
She just hated her outfit.

01:01:48.083 --> 01:01:50.542
Yippee ki-yay!

01:01:58.917 --> 01:02:00.917
Yeah!

01:02:03.208 --> 01:02:05.583
You believe I fell down the stairs, right?

01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:08.000
What stairs?

01:02:33.042 --> 01:02:35.333
- Hello?
- Bring me the phone.

01:02:35.542 --> 01:02:38.375
- Put Liberace on.
- Is this who I think is this?

01:02:38.542 --> 01:02:41.958
- Back from the dead?
- Yeah, Lazlo, skip the formalities.

01:02:42.125 --> 01:02:45.375
Call you at 2:00 and tell you
where we'll make the exchange.

01:02:45.542 --> 01:02:49.917
Well, it better be 2 on the dot
or I start cutting off the batch's fingers...

01:02:50.083 --> 01:02:52.792
...one at a time! Wouldn't that be nice...

01:02:52.958 --> 01:02:55.167
...to get little pieces of the girl?

01:02:55.375 --> 01:02:57.333
One, two, three...

01:02:57.542 --> 01:03:00.167
...little tiny pieces.
- Drop dead.

01:03:00.625 --> 01:03:02.583
- What'd he say?
- He said hi.

01:03:02.875 --> 01:03:05.667
- We'll need more firepower.
- I got guns. All you need.

01:03:05.875 --> 01:03:08.375
Oz, you stud.

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:32.375
- Here they are. What do you think?
- Oh, my God!

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:36.208
- Oh, my God, you have an H and K MP5K.
- Can we hurry? It's almost 2.

01:03:36.375 --> 01:03:38.917
We're gonna be fine.
Oh, wait, can I see this?

01:03:39.083 --> 01:03:41.500
- Allow me. I got it.
- Okay.

01:03:41.667 --> 01:03:44.375
Gotta be careful with these things.

01:03:49.167 --> 01:03:50.708
I got it.

01:03:59.792 --> 01:04:01.500
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, topnotch.

01:04:01.667 --> 01:04:05.458
It's almost 2. We've gotta
load them up and move them out.

01:04:05.625 --> 01:04:08.042
- Don't screw around.
- Careful.

01:04:08.208 --> 01:04:09.708
- All right.
- There.

01:04:14.667 --> 01:04:16.083
I got it. I got it.

01:04:18.917 --> 01:04:21.167
Hold on, Oz.

01:04:37.375 --> 01:04:40.208
Would you be careful of the fixtures?

01:04:44.042 --> 01:04:46.375
I hurt the side part of my head.

01:04:48.375 --> 01:04:51.625
Nice guns. Put them in the back seat.

01:04:53.667 --> 01:04:55.625
You made her carry all the guns, Oz?

01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:58.917
Okay, can we call Lazlo? It's after 2.

01:05:00.125 --> 01:05:02.458
Jimmy, you're late.

01:05:02.625 --> 01:05:04.542
Bring Cynthia to the Beverly Center.

01:05:05.042 --> 01:05:08.167
- Meet at the food court in an hour.
- I wanna talk to my son.

01:05:08.375 --> 01:05:10.958
You're gonna have to
hold on a minute.

01:05:11.625 --> 01:05:13.333
- Go get Strabo.
- I'll get Strabo.

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.542
- I just said that.
- Right.

01:05:16.042 --> 01:05:17.667
Go.

01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:29.542
Strabo.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.250
Damn it!

01:05:34.042 --> 01:05:36.208
I can't find Strabo.
I think he's gone.

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.292
- What?
- He's not where we left him.

01:05:38.458 --> 01:05:40.000
Hold on.
What do you mean?

01:05:40.167 --> 01:05:41.542
I'm holding, I'm holding.

01:05:41.708 --> 01:05:43.625
There's just pieces of wood...

01:05:43.792 --> 01:05:46.458
- Where the hell is Strabo, people?
- In the trunk.

01:05:48.542 --> 01:05:51.542
Okay. How did Strabo
get in the trunk, Oz?

01:05:52.083 --> 01:05:55.250
- I don't know.
- Well, get him out.

01:05:57.792 --> 01:06:00.083
- Where are the keys?
- In here, with me.

01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:02.542
- It keeps getting better.
- Why's he in the trunk?

01:06:02.708 --> 01:06:05.375
I don't know! You were
supposed to be watching him!

01:06:05.542 --> 01:06:06.833
Tulip!

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.208
- Hold on, Lazlo.
- All right, you know what?

01:06:09.375 --> 01:06:12.250
No more holding.
Put my son on the phone now!

01:06:15.208 --> 01:06:17.750
- Your son's...
- Strabonitz?

01:06:18.208 --> 01:06:22.708
- Your son's in the trunk right now.
- The trunk? I wanna talk to my son!

01:06:26.083 --> 01:06:29.542
Strabo, your father
wants to talk to you.

01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:33.542
What?

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.417
- Did you get the gist of that?
- Yes.

01:06:38.458 --> 01:06:40.500
You locked my son in the trunk?

01:06:40.708 --> 01:06:43.375
No, no, sir. No, sir.
He locked himself in there.

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:50.042
This I believe. Fine.
You have a spare key?

01:06:50.208 --> 01:06:53.167
- A spare key?
- No. Car Ranch Rentals only gave us one.

01:06:53.333 --> 01:06:56.208
- Negative on the spare key.
- What about a locksmith?

01:06:56.458 --> 01:06:59.583
- Do you know of one in the area?
- It's your town, dentist.

01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:04.458
You should know where a...
Fine, you know what, Mr. Brain?

01:07:05.375 --> 01:07:07.583
The trunk release button,
how about that?

01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:10.917
Every car since 1 985 has
a trunk release button.

01:07:11.083 --> 01:07:14.333
Find it, open the trunk
and let my boy out.

01:07:14.542 --> 01:07:18.667
There's a button on the driver's side.
Every car since 1 985...

01:07:22.375 --> 01:07:25.333
We kill them the moment we
see them. In the head.

01:07:25.667 --> 01:07:28.708
- I can't find it.
- What kind of piece of shit car is this?

01:07:28.917 --> 01:07:31.250
- Well, Car Ranch Rentals.
- It's a hitter!

01:07:31.417 --> 01:07:35.042
- A hitter. Lazlo's got a hitter on us.
- Did you hire a hitter?

01:07:35.208 --> 01:07:38.292
Did I? I don't remember, really.

01:07:38.458 --> 01:07:42.000
- Is someone shooting at you?
- Your hitter is hitting at us!

01:07:43.875 --> 01:07:46.375
That's bad. My son is there!

01:07:46.542 --> 01:07:49.167
- Tell the hitter to stop.
- Your boss says to stop.

01:07:49.375 --> 01:07:51.542
- His son's with us. Stop!
- This is Lazlo.

01:07:51.708 --> 01:07:54.375
- Stop shooting!
- That's a direct Hungarian order!

01:07:54.792 --> 01:07:56.708
Let me find speakerphone.

01:07:56.875 --> 01:07:59.083
- Cease fire!
- What's going on? Talk to me.

01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:01.542
He's not listening to you.

01:08:03.292 --> 01:08:05.292
Well, you should fire him.

01:08:06.542 --> 01:08:08.208
- Are you kidding?
- That was me.

01:08:08.375 --> 01:08:10.333
- Try not to shoot Oz, honey.
- Yeah.

01:08:16.207 --> 01:08:17.792
Let's go, kids!

01:08:25.957 --> 01:08:27.875
Get up!

01:08:30.207 --> 01:08:33.207
You are in no danger.

01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:36.542
If she moves,
put your cane through her eye.

01:08:54.457 --> 01:08:56.125
Unbelievable.

01:08:57.582 --> 01:09:00.417
- How did you do that?
- Every car since 1 985...

01:09:00.582 --> 01:09:02.542
...had a little button right here.

01:09:07.207 --> 01:09:09.292
All right, come on out of there...

01:09:17.207 --> 01:09:19.500
- What is this?
- That's a dead hostage, Oz.

01:09:19.707 --> 01:09:22.000
- That is what that is.
- That can't be good.

01:09:22.167 --> 01:09:24.082
No, you're right. That's not good.

01:09:24.292 --> 01:09:28.042
It looks like he got shot in the foot.
Who dies from a shot in the foot?

01:09:28.207 --> 01:09:30.832
He probably got shot when
the hitter was shooting.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.667
That's really great. Well done, Jill.

01:09:33.875 --> 01:09:35.707
Hey, look, shit happens.

01:09:35.875 --> 01:09:37.667
That's right.
Shit happens, to you.

01:09:37.875 --> 01:09:39.292
All the time!

01:09:39.457 --> 01:09:42.917
You know why? Because you don't
follow the ABC's of killing.

01:09:43.082 --> 01:09:45.082
- There's an ABC's of killing?
- Shut up!

01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:47.957
How was I supposed to know
he'd climb in the trunk?

01:09:48.125 --> 01:09:49.832
- That's a good question.
- I mean...

01:09:50.042 --> 01:09:52.125
I know! How about you
just watch him...

01:09:52.292 --> 01:09:54.207
...and you don't let him
climb in!

01:09:54.375 --> 01:09:58.625
I am a professional marksman.
It's not my job to babysit...

01:09:58.792 --> 01:10:01.667
You know what? I think
you have to hit something...

01:10:01.833 --> 01:10:04.083
...to count as a marksman.
- Ozzie. Harriet.

01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:06.417
Can we stop fighting and go get my wife?

01:10:06.583 --> 01:10:10.667
Well, you can just forget about
that, Oz. Cynthia is as good as dead.

01:10:10.875 --> 01:10:12.833
- What? Don't say that.
- I am saying it.

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:15.458
She's as good as dead.
We have nothing...

01:10:15.625 --> 01:10:18.833
...thanks to Jill. Look at this guy.
- Don't pin this on me!

01:10:19.125 --> 01:10:21.625
If I'm a screwup,
what are you doing with me?

01:10:21.792 --> 01:10:24.292
You know what?
That's a really good question.

01:10:24.458 --> 01:10:26.125
I'm out of here.

01:10:26.292 --> 01:10:28.375
Well, you're not going, are you?

01:10:29.375 --> 01:10:33.875
Hold on a minute.
You're gonna need the keys.

01:10:35.417 --> 01:10:37.208
- Bye-bye.
- I'm serious.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.333
If I get in that car, you're
never gonna see me again.

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:43.833
Careful backing out, hon.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.958
Let's go.

01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:51.167
Bag.

01:10:52.417 --> 01:10:55.583
Why don't you take your pal Strabo
with you. Remember him?

01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:58.125
The Hungarian mobster
that you let die?

01:10:58.292 --> 01:11:00.292
He's sorry. He's very sorry!

01:11:04.042 --> 01:11:07.458
She's coming back. I mean,
she's gonna come back, right?

01:11:08.667 --> 01:11:11.208
- I don't think so.
- Oh, well, this is just great.

01:11:11.375 --> 01:11:13.000
What are we gonna do now?

01:11:13.167 --> 01:11:14.917
You know what? I'm gonna leave.

01:11:15.083 --> 01:11:17.208
You're on your own, Oz.

01:11:20.833 --> 01:11:22.292
I thought we were friends.

01:11:23.333 --> 01:11:27.833
Well, that's what you get
for trusting a contract killer, Oz.

01:11:36.917 --> 01:11:39.000
You son of a bitch.

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:46.250
You can't do this to Cynthia. Okay?

01:11:46.417 --> 01:11:50.750
Not okay. Your darling Cynthia's
not completely innocent in all this, Oz.

01:11:50.917 --> 01:11:55.458
- What? What does that mean?
- Shit, shit, shit! Jill took my bag!

01:11:55.625 --> 01:11:58.333
So?
- So there was something really important...

01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:00.375
...in the other bag, okay, Oz?

01:12:21.083 --> 01:12:22.958
Great.

01:12:26.042 --> 01:12:28.500
- Hello.
- Dentist, you hung up on me.

01:12:28.667 --> 01:12:30.875
- Are you insane?
- Lazlo.

01:12:31.042 --> 01:12:34.250
- Hey, there was a button in the trunk.
- That's great news.

01:12:35.083 --> 01:12:38.333
- Put my son on the phone, damn it!
- He's...

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:41.750
We're gonna have to
push back that meeting, Lazlo.

01:12:41.917 --> 01:12:44.125
No, no. No pushing.
Put him on the phone.

01:12:44.292 --> 01:12:48.042
I'm sorry, what? I can't hear you.
There seems to be a little static.

01:12:48.208 --> 01:12:51.792
- Are you going through a canyon?
- Am I going through a canyon? No.

01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:53.417
Hello?

01:12:53.583 --> 01:12:55.708
- Hello?
- Lazlo? Lazlo?

01:12:58.125 --> 01:12:59.708
Dentist! Can you hear me?

01:13:00.708 --> 01:13:03.625
You're seconds from dead.

01:13:08.208 --> 01:13:09.458
Strabonitz.

01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:29.542
Hey, Jill.

01:13:29.708 --> 01:13:32.208
- It's me. How you doing?
- Let me ask you something.

01:13:32.375 --> 01:13:34.625
If you hadn't taken the wrong bag,
would we be talking?

01:13:34.792 --> 01:13:36.917
- Are you mad or something?
- Get real.

01:13:37.083 --> 01:13:38.542
- I mean, seriously.
- No.

01:13:38.708 --> 01:13:41.042
All right? You happy now?

01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:43.708
I chased you away
so I could protect you, Jill.

01:13:43.875 --> 01:13:46.833
- I don't know why you don't believe that.
- I don't believe you.

01:13:47.042 --> 01:13:48.542
- Jill.
- I don't trust you.

01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:51.875
How am I supposed to have a kid
with somebody I don't trust?

01:13:52.708 --> 01:13:56.458
Forget it. I don't even know if
I wanna have a kid with you anymore.

01:13:56.958 --> 01:13:58.250
Hold on a minute.

01:13:58.958 --> 01:14:02.500
I think that if I were pregnant
right now, I wouldn't even tell you.

01:14:02.708 --> 01:14:06.500
If you had a son and l...
And you were his mom and I was his dad...

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:08.375
...you wouldn't let me see him?

01:14:08.542 --> 01:14:10.167
- Not once.
- Don't say that.

01:14:10.417 --> 01:14:12.417
- Take it back right now.
- I'm not.

01:14:12.583 --> 01:14:15.833
You better tell me everything now
or I'm not gonna help you.

01:14:16.042 --> 01:14:17.708
How far back does this thing go?

01:14:17.875 --> 01:14:19.792
Like a couple days or something.

01:14:19.958 --> 01:14:23.875
You're so full of it.
You're gonna lie to me more?

01:14:24.042 --> 01:14:26.083
All right, months.
You happy now?

01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:28.042
And why was Cynthia in on it?

01:14:28.208 --> 01:14:29.708
I wanted to keep you
out of harm's way.

01:14:29.875 --> 01:14:31.958
- You trusted her not to get hurt.
- Jill.

01:14:32.125 --> 01:14:35.708
I gotta go help Oz. For me to do that,
I've gotta go up there.

01:14:35.875 --> 01:14:39.542
- Just do everything I told you, all right?
- Don't worry.

01:14:39.708 --> 01:14:43.250
I'll remember everything you told me.

01:14:55.208 --> 01:14:57.375
Call Mrs. Himelfarb,
remind her to floss...

01:14:57.542 --> 01:14:59.667
...cancel my appointments
for the rest of my life...

01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:02.375
...send in as much nitrous as you can,
call the FBI.

01:15:02.542 --> 01:15:04.042
- What?
- Call the FBI!

01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:07.833
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong? What's wrong?

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.833
I'll tell you.
Everything's wrong.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.083
Take a look around you.
Nothing's right.

01:15:12.667 --> 01:15:17.000
Cynthia got kidnapped by Hungarian killers.
And instead of calling the FBI...

01:15:17.167 --> 01:15:20.167
...or the police,
like every other rational man, I thought:

01:15:20.375 --> 01:15:24.833
"Hey, let's try to get in contact with
somebody else that kills a lot of people."

01:15:25.042 --> 01:15:28.458
So I went down to Mexico,
which is heavily underdeveloped...

01:15:28.625 --> 01:15:30.625
...and I asked him to help me.
Did he?

01:15:30.833 --> 01:15:33.917
No, he didn't help me out.
He didn't help me out!

01:15:34.083 --> 01:15:36.417
Know what he did?
He put on bunny slippers...

01:15:36.583 --> 01:15:39.583
...he shot at me and then
he cooked me some chicken!

01:15:42.208 --> 01:15:44.458
I'm gonna be okay.

01:15:44.625 --> 01:15:45.958
I'm gonna calm down...

01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:50.542
...I'm gonna go downstairs and I'm gonna
take a nice, leisurely drive in my Porsche.

01:15:50.708 --> 01:15:54.625
Wait a minute. I can't drive my Porsche,
because I don't have one anymore.

01:15:54.792 --> 01:15:57.250
That's gone, that's history,
that's archives!

01:15:57.458 --> 01:16:01.042
We left the Porsche so we could get
on a bus and rent some other car.

01:16:01.208 --> 01:16:03.500
And you know why?
Because I don't. Do you?

01:16:03.708 --> 01:16:06.750
Some kind of GPS,
I don't know, system.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000
- What's that smell?
- I'll tell you what that smell is. It's me.

01:16:13.208 --> 01:16:15.333
I smell. And you know why?

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:18.708
I've been wearing this suit
for three days. I smell like ass.

01:16:18.875 --> 01:16:21.417
Or foot. Or some kind of foot...

01:16:21.583 --> 01:16:26.292
...that's been lodged up deep, deep, deep
inside an ass. I'll tell you the worst thing:

01:16:26.458 --> 01:16:30.833
I woke up naked next to another
naked man who admittedly wets the bed.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.958
So if you talk to anybody
or anybody calls here...

01:16:35.583 --> 01:16:38.292
...you tell them I fell down
a flight of stairs.

01:16:38.458 --> 01:16:40.542
- Yes, sir.
- Don't "Yes, sir" me!

01:16:40.708 --> 01:16:43.625
- Call the FBI.
- Calling. I'm calling.

01:16:43.792 --> 01:16:45.625
Dial F-B-I.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.667
Call the FBI and tell them
I fell down a flight of stairs!

01:17:06.583 --> 01:17:10.417
Going to the feds is the thing
that's gonna get Cynthia killed.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.583
What are you doing here?
I don't need you anymore.

01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:17.292
I can handle this on my own.
I'm an adult.

01:17:24.167 --> 01:17:25.875
You okay?

01:17:26.042 --> 01:17:27.500
Thanks.

01:17:28.667 --> 01:17:33.208
Let's face it, Oz. Kicking ass is not
your expertise. That's my job.

01:17:33.625 --> 01:17:37.333
Hanging on to the woman you love
is where I fall a little short.

01:17:38.667 --> 01:17:40.000
- How do you do that?
- What?

01:17:40.208 --> 01:17:42.125
That. That.

01:17:42.708 --> 01:17:45.750
One minute I wanna kill you,
the next minute you got me...

01:17:46.208 --> 01:17:49.417
...feeling sorry for you.
- Oz, you really are a good guy.

01:17:49.583 --> 01:17:53.458
And I don't want you, Cynthia or anyone
else paying for my past sins.

01:17:53.625 --> 01:17:56.333
I thought you said friendship
was overrated.

01:17:56.542 --> 01:17:59.083
I'm a liar.

01:18:01.083 --> 01:18:03.417
- So, what do we do?
- Go get Cynthia.

01:18:03.583 --> 01:18:06.125
- How?
- You just leave that to Jimmy Tudeski.

01:18:06.417 --> 01:18:07.958
- God, Julie. Julie, Julie...

01:18:08.125 --> 01:18:10.167
...don't call the FBI!
- Julie who?

01:18:10.375 --> 01:18:13.333
My receptionist.
Your wife's replacement.

01:18:17.083 --> 01:18:20.083
- Julie, what did you do?
- I chloroformed his ass.

01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:22.042
Why?
You don't have to tell me why.

01:18:22.208 --> 01:18:25.542
Now, you can go quietly or your ass
can get the chloroform too.

01:18:26.542 --> 01:18:30.125
- What kind of receptionist are you?
- The kind that doesn't forget...

01:18:30.292 --> 01:18:33.125
...who murdered her brother.
- What?

01:18:33.292 --> 01:18:35.917
Look, I'm gonna get
the temp agency on the phone.

01:18:36.083 --> 01:18:39.917
Don't you dare make a move,
Dr. Oseransky. Keep your ass right there.

01:18:40.083 --> 01:18:43.250
Julie. Julie, if that is your real name...

01:18:43.417 --> 01:18:46.458
My name is Jules. Jules Figueroa.

01:18:52.208 --> 01:18:55.667
- Frankie Figs?
- Frankie Figs.

01:18:55.875 --> 01:19:00.250
You remember that? He was my brother.
And I do believe you knew him.

01:19:01.792 --> 01:19:04.958
- I'll take that chloroform now.
- Yeah, I know you will.

01:19:23.208 --> 01:19:27.375
- You smell great, baby.
- Oz.

01:19:28.917 --> 01:19:32.042
You know, I don't have to be
at work today. We can:

01:19:34.708 --> 01:19:36.750
Oz.

01:19:46.667 --> 01:19:48.125
Jimmy.

01:19:48.875 --> 01:19:51.458
Jimmy. Jimmy!

01:19:55.833 --> 01:19:58.500
It's been a long time since
I've been chloroformed.

01:19:58.667 --> 01:20:00.958
Still got that little zing to it,
though.

01:20:01.958 --> 01:20:05.583
Tastes like they put a bunch of pennies
in your mouth, doesn't it?

01:20:07.042 --> 01:20:08.333
Jimmy, I'm sorry.

01:20:08.542 --> 01:20:10.000
- I didn't find it.
- What?

01:20:10.208 --> 01:20:11.667
You've been here three days.

01:20:11.875 --> 01:20:14.125
- I got into the safe. It's not there.
- Safe?

01:20:14.292 --> 01:20:16.542
- It's here somewhere.
- This isn't exactly...

01:20:16.708 --> 01:20:19.333
...what we talked about, either.
- Calm down.

01:20:19.542 --> 01:20:22.333
- What do mean, "Calm down"?
- All right? I'm on it.

01:20:22.542 --> 01:20:26.625
What safe? Why are you guys
talking together so much?

01:20:40.667 --> 01:20:43.375
Have you been involved in this
from the beginning?

01:20:43.625 --> 01:20:45.875
- Oz...
- Correct me if I'm wrong...

01:20:46.042 --> 01:20:47.875
...but we took vows.

01:20:48.042 --> 01:20:51.083
One was you're not
supposed to pretend you're kidnapped...

01:20:51.250 --> 01:20:54.500
...and get your husband shot at
while he's trying to save you.

01:20:54.708 --> 01:20:57.417
- That was uncalled for.
- I'm not a lawyer...

01:20:57.583 --> 01:21:00.333
...but I believe this is grounds for divorce.

01:21:00.542 --> 01:21:02.792
And what is that sound?

01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:06.375
- That's chain saws.
- Chain saw. Check.

01:21:06.875 --> 01:21:08.750
Hack tub.

01:21:10.542 --> 01:21:12.292
What is that for?

01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:15.958
- What is it?
- They hack us up into pieces in that...

01:21:16.125 --> 01:21:19.500
...so blood doesn't get everywhere.
- I see.

01:21:21.042 --> 01:21:23.417
They put the hacked-up
pieces in those bags.

01:21:23.583 --> 01:21:27.083
- Are you done?
- Yes, he's done.

01:21:28.792 --> 01:21:34.208
Jimmy Tulip.
The rat-shit scum of Chicago.

01:21:34.792 --> 01:21:36.500
Mr. Tough Guy...

01:21:36.708 --> 01:21:41.333
...served up to me on a platter
by the pretty black girl.

01:21:43.208 --> 01:21:44.583
That stings.

01:21:45.375 --> 01:21:48.500
I made you who you are
and you stab me in the heart...

01:21:49.125 --> 01:21:51.250
...with something sharp.

01:21:51.417 --> 01:21:53.000
He made you who you are?

01:21:53.292 --> 01:21:57.667
Oh, yes. Could not fire a slingshot
until I taught him how.

01:21:57.833 --> 01:22:00.417
"Pay attention, little boy. Hold it firm.

01:22:00.583 --> 01:22:03.917
Stop crying and watch.
Like this."

01:22:08.375 --> 01:22:11.958
- Where's Strabo?
- I'm pretty sure he's with Janni right now.

01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:19.917
Where is my son?

01:22:26.042 --> 01:22:29.042
- Where's my boy?!
- All right, that's it. I've had enough.

01:22:29.208 --> 01:22:31.417
- Oz.
- No. If you ever wanna see your son...

01:22:31.583 --> 01:22:33.833
...alive again, you'll let
us go right now.

01:22:34.042 --> 01:22:35.958
Is that right?

01:22:36.125 --> 01:22:38.292
Yeah, that's right.

01:22:38.458 --> 01:22:41.167
And if we're not out of here by 1 1:00...

01:22:41.333 --> 01:22:46.417
...Jill's gonna put one in Strabo's forehead,
just like Jimmy put one in Janni's forehead.

01:22:48.458 --> 01:22:51.000
- It wasn't pretty.
- Give me a gun.

01:22:51.208 --> 01:22:53.000
- Not bad, Oz.
- Thanks.

01:22:55.792 --> 01:22:57.625
- I think it's Jimmy's wife.
- What?

01:22:57.792 --> 01:22:59.250
No. That was going so well.

01:22:59.417 --> 01:23:01.167
- What is this?
- I wanna come in...

01:23:01.333 --> 01:23:03.000
...and talk business with you.

01:23:03.167 --> 01:23:04.833
- Or else.
- Or else what?

01:23:05.042 --> 01:23:08.625
Or else I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to blow Strabo's head off.

01:23:08.792 --> 01:23:11.083
Oh, no, no, no.
Strabo, you all right?

01:23:15.917 --> 01:23:17.167
He's fine.

01:23:18.875 --> 01:23:21.750
He can't talk, he's duct-taped.

01:23:22.292 --> 01:23:24.375
I got this car wired with explosives.

01:23:24.917 --> 01:23:28.000
- You let me in, he'll be fine.
- Fine.

01:23:28.208 --> 01:23:33.000
Come in, do whatever you want, apparently.
Get the broad! Get the car! Get the Strabo!

01:23:36.292 --> 01:23:38.417
Wait a minute.
What is in the big purse?

01:23:38.583 --> 01:23:41.208
- Nothing, it's... I'm good.
- It's what?

01:23:41.375 --> 01:23:42.875
- Take a right.
- This way.

01:23:43.042 --> 01:23:46.333
What the fook are you
assholes up to now?

01:23:47.083 --> 01:23:48.708
Look who's here.

01:23:49.917 --> 01:23:52.708
Can I ask you a questionnaire
how you found this place?

01:23:52.875 --> 01:23:54.250
Nice Porsche you got.

01:23:54.417 --> 01:23:56.417
You still have the Porsche?

01:23:56.583 --> 01:23:59.333
Let me explain when we all get
a moment together...

01:23:59.542 --> 01:24:02.167
...the concept of the secret hideout.
- All right!

01:24:02.375 --> 01:24:04.750
Drop your weapons now
and slide them to me...

01:24:04.917 --> 01:24:09.000
...or I press the button and Strabo gets
blown to little Hungarian meatballs.

01:24:09.208 --> 01:24:12.542
- Don't push nothing.
- I'm gonna push it. Drop them! Now!

01:24:12.708 --> 01:24:14.042
- Drop them!
- Drop it.

01:24:14.208 --> 01:24:16.208
- Go ahead. Come on.
- On the floor.

01:24:16.375 --> 01:24:18.792
Kick them over. Step away.

01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:23.792
- Untie Oz and Cynthia.
- No untying...

01:24:23.958 --> 01:24:26.667
- Do it! Untie them.
- Let's see where it's going.

01:24:26.875 --> 01:24:29.083
All right. Come on, come on.

01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:33.458
Aren't you forgetting something?

01:24:33.625 --> 01:24:36.292
Am I forgetting something?
I don't think so.

01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:38.958
- They had a terrible fight.
- Did they?

01:24:39.625 --> 01:24:44.333
- What if I had something you want?
- I would be baffled, to begin with.

01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.000
Or, more precisely...

01:24:48.708 --> 01:24:50.500
...half of something you want.

01:24:51.375 --> 01:24:52.667
Don't.

01:24:53.583 --> 01:24:56.375
You have Jimmy's half.

01:24:57.792 --> 01:25:01.292
- Would you cut me in for a slice?
- You want a slice of the pee?

01:25:02.708 --> 01:25:04.500
Maybe...

01:25:05.167 --> 01:25:08.333
- Keep talking.
- I wanna work for you.

01:25:08.542 --> 01:25:11.417
- Of course you do.
- I don't have any allegiances.

01:25:11.583 --> 01:25:15.042
I'm all yours. And I could be your
most valuable hitter.

01:25:17.375 --> 01:25:20.083
You shut up or I'll
blow your brains out!

01:25:21.042 --> 01:25:25.500
First thing I'm going to need
is my son Strabo in my company.

01:25:25.708 --> 01:25:27.542
Secondly, maybe a little test.

01:25:27.708 --> 01:25:30.625
I'm thinking, kill Jimmy.

01:25:31.542 --> 01:25:34.042
In the melon. One shot.

01:25:34.208 --> 01:25:36.583
- What do you say?
- Name the time and place.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.792
Is now good for you?

01:25:43.875 --> 01:25:47.375
- Right here, right now?
- Right now.

01:25:52.375 --> 01:25:55.708
- You gotta be kidding me, right?
- What the hell are you doing?

01:25:57.542 --> 01:25:59.125
Take your little cross back.

01:25:59.292 --> 01:26:01.292
What'll you do without
your good luck charm?

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:03.417
- Stop screwing around.
- Shut up, Oz!

01:26:03.583 --> 01:26:07.542
That's right, Jill, stop screwing around.
You're not gonna shoot anybody.

01:26:07.708 --> 01:26:10.750
Just tell me you're not
still in love with Cynthia.

01:26:10.917 --> 01:26:12.875
- I'm not gonna do that.
- Why?

01:26:13.042 --> 01:26:16.667
She's my ex-wife. I still have feelings
for her and I always will.

01:26:16.875 --> 01:26:19.333
- That's a really bad answer.
- Shut up, Oz.

01:26:19.542 --> 01:26:22.167
You can't even just say it, can you?

01:26:22.333 --> 01:26:23.625
Just say it.

01:26:24.208 --> 01:26:27.625
This is reminding me now
of my favorite soup opera:

01:26:27.792 --> 01:26:30.083
The Hourglass of My Sand Children.

01:26:32.208 --> 01:26:36.458
Listen, you're either a shooter
or you're not.

01:26:36.625 --> 01:26:39.292
I am. I am.

01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:41.083
I am.

01:26:41.542 --> 01:26:43.125
Here's an idea for you:

01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:46.542
- Got an elevator shaft around here, Lazlo?
- I'm sorry?

01:26:47.542 --> 01:26:50.542
Because I could fall down that,
you know. Die that way.

01:26:50.708 --> 01:26:53.458
- Stop.
- That would be the only way to get killed.

01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:56.667
- Shut up!
- You couldn't even hit that lamp over there.

01:26:57.167 --> 01:27:00.750
I'll give you a tip. You wanna hit that
lamp, you should aim at me.

01:27:02.583 --> 01:27:04.125
She aimed and hit the lamp.

01:27:04.292 --> 01:27:05.792
She aimed and hit the lamp.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.125
- Lucky shot.
- I'm gonna give you one last chance, baby.

01:27:09.292 --> 01:27:10.958
You don't have the balls.

01:27:11.208 --> 01:27:14.833
- This from a guy who rarely gets it up.
- We never had that problem.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.333
Not helping.
Why isn't anybody helping?

01:27:17.542 --> 01:27:21.167
I think you have to be in love
with someone to get it up, Jill.

01:27:22.542 --> 01:27:23.833
Shoot him.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.833
You're never gonna be a hit girl...

01:27:26.042 --> 01:27:30.708
...just a stupid, stumbling, bumbling,
can't-kill-anything ex-dental assistant.

01:27:42.708 --> 01:27:44.667
- Jimmy, Jimmy.
- He's dead?

01:27:44.875 --> 01:27:47.042
- Yes?
- He's dead. He's dead!

01:27:47.208 --> 01:27:51.167
He's dead! I didn't think you
had it in you, quite frankly.

01:27:51.333 --> 01:27:54.667
Don't cry. Everything's going
to be fine. Go get Strabo, now.

01:27:54.875 --> 01:27:59.167
Give me this. For the record,
this is, what, a garage door opener?

01:27:59.458 --> 01:28:01.292
Very clever.

01:28:01.458 --> 01:28:06.792
So clever, I want you to keep
that aimed at her, please.

01:28:06.958 --> 01:28:10.375
- Wait. I thought we had a deal.
- "I thought we had a deal." No.

01:28:13.208 --> 01:28:14.458
Locked.

01:28:20.917 --> 01:28:23.375
Lazlo, the car is loaded with Primacord.

01:28:25.542 --> 01:28:27.375
I'm sure it is.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.792
The first dollar
I ever stole is back together.

01:28:47.042 --> 01:28:49.792
- You okay? You okay?
- Yeah.

01:28:52.208 --> 01:28:56.583
You killed Strabonitz.

01:29:00.208 --> 01:29:01.458
Oh, look what I did.

01:29:08.208 --> 01:29:10.208
Good work, Jimmy.
"Jammy, Jammy."

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.875
Nice work with that chair, Oz.
Way to go, Cyn.

01:29:13.042 --> 01:29:14.958
- Come here, baby.
- You're alive?

01:29:15.125 --> 01:29:16.667
I mean, good, but you...

01:29:19.083 --> 01:29:23.542
Don't even think about it. You were
in on this whole thing from the beginning!

01:29:23.708 --> 01:29:26.792
Of course. It's an old routine.
It's the Skokie Switcheroo.

01:29:26.958 --> 01:29:30.583
"The Skokie Switch..."? Where do
you guys come up with these names?

01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:33.500
I just watched my friend
get shot through the heart.

01:29:33.708 --> 01:29:37.208
- Larry's House of Halloween.
- And what is the deal with that lamp?

01:29:37.375 --> 01:29:39.375
I saw her shoot the lamp.

01:29:39.542 --> 01:29:42.833
The first round was live, the rest
were blanks. Try and keep up.

01:29:43.042 --> 01:29:46.333
- We are gonna have such a talk later.
- Sons of batches!

01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:51.500
So how far back does this go?
Hell, you were shooting at me in Mexico.

01:29:51.667 --> 01:29:53.708
Was that all part of the plan?

01:29:53.875 --> 01:29:56.000
As a matter of fact, it was, yeah.

01:29:56.667 --> 01:30:00.625
- You killed my Strabo!
- Actually, Strabonitz was already dead.

01:30:00.792 --> 01:30:03.292
Your hitter got him
when she was shooting at us.

01:30:03.542 --> 01:30:06.792
- This true?
- Lazlo, shit happens.

01:30:06.958 --> 01:30:08.333
Shit...

01:30:08.542 --> 01:30:10.125
Yeah, watch this shit happen.

01:30:12.958 --> 01:30:16.500
- All right. Take it easy.
- Was that real? Is she really dead?

01:30:16.708 --> 01:30:18.542
I mean, was that a fake bullet?

01:30:19.417 --> 01:30:24.417
Jimmy, let me propose something
before you start the killing.

01:30:24.583 --> 01:30:28.500
Regroup the Gogolak gang.
Fifty-fifty, you and me.

01:30:28.667 --> 01:30:33.125
Like the old days.
Murder, mayhem, a couple of laughs.

01:30:34.542 --> 01:30:37.917
I don't think so, Lazlo.
Jill, tie him up.

01:30:38.083 --> 01:30:40.125
- Wait.
- What am I gonna tie him up for?

01:30:40.292 --> 01:30:42.167
- I'm gonna kill him.
- No, he said...

01:30:42.333 --> 01:30:43.833
I said that, but we can't.

01:30:44.042 --> 01:30:47.000
Of course you can't.
You can't kill anybody for real.

01:30:47.208 --> 01:30:48.708
I can. It's point-blank range.

01:30:48.875 --> 01:30:51.042
I didn't mean you can't shoot him...

01:30:51.208 --> 01:30:53.667
...I mean you just can't shoot him.
- Come on.

01:30:53.833 --> 01:30:56.333
- You said I'll make my bones.
- On somebody else.

01:30:56.542 --> 01:30:58.917
- You can't kill him.
- How do you "make bones"?

01:30:59.083 --> 01:31:01.292
She wants to make a name for herself.

01:31:01.458 --> 01:31:02.792
You said I could!

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.333
- Will you just listen?
- Tell me why.

01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:07.917
- You heard what he said!
- Tell me why not!

01:31:08.083 --> 01:31:10.250
Because he's my father!

01:31:11.875 --> 01:31:14.333
- Even I didn't know about this.
- See? See?

01:31:14.542 --> 01:31:18.792
It doesn't feel good to not be involved
in the plan, to not know what...

01:31:19.250 --> 01:31:22.917
- He's your father?
- I raised you as one of my own.

01:31:23.458 --> 01:31:26.375
- That's far enough.
- I made him a man!

01:31:28.333 --> 01:31:31.125
A man who can't kill his papa.

01:31:34.417 --> 01:31:37.708
Step aside, Jill. It could go right through.

01:31:40.667 --> 01:31:43.125
Jimmy.

01:31:48.708 --> 01:31:52.375
- Jill, shoot Papa in the foot.
- Straight through or leave a souvenir?

01:31:52.583 --> 01:31:54.333
- Souvenir.
- Wait.

01:31:57.125 --> 01:31:58.792
That's gotta hurt.

01:31:59.917 --> 01:32:03.458
- Who is that? The fake police?
- Okay, we gotta go.

01:32:03.625 --> 01:32:07.292
I'm not going anywhere until somebody
tells me what this is all about.

01:32:07.458 --> 01:32:11.667
Cynthia, help me get Oz out of here.
Thanks for the inheritance, Pops.

01:32:12.708 --> 01:32:16.167
- Way to go, Cyn.
- You'll never live to spend a dime, Jimmy!

01:32:27.208 --> 01:32:29.875
We're rich! We're rich!

01:32:32.083 --> 01:32:34.708
- Baby, you were so good.
- I had a good teacher.

01:32:34.875 --> 01:32:38.833
I'm so glad we're so overjoyed.
I've never been this confused in my life.

01:32:39.042 --> 01:32:41.375
I think you dropped this a while back.

01:32:41.542 --> 01:32:45.083
No, just borrowing it
from an old friend, that's all.

01:32:45.250 --> 01:32:48.125
- Don't need it anymore, Cyn.
- Okay.

01:32:48.292 --> 01:32:50.292
Would somebody tell me
what's going on?

01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:53.625
This is what's going on.
See that number right there?

01:32:53.792 --> 01:32:57.000
That is Lazlo Gogolak's main account
in the Grand Caymans.

01:32:57.167 --> 01:33:01.042
Somewhere around 280 million dollars,
half of which is yours.

01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:03.625
Your tooth-pulling days are over, Oz.

01:33:03.792 --> 01:33:05.708
- That was the plan?
- Yes!

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.917
- Were you in on it?
- I didn't know until this afternoon.

01:33:09.083 --> 01:33:10.958
Why couldn't I have been involved?

01:33:11.125 --> 01:33:13.375
I could have played a part.
I minored in theater.

01:33:13.542 --> 01:33:15.958
Two hundred and eighty million dollars?

01:33:17.125 --> 01:33:20.417
That's it. This is too much.
It's great, but it's too much.

01:33:20.667 --> 01:33:23.333
- Any more surprises?
- Just one.

01:33:23.542 --> 01:33:25.500
- What?
- I guess the doctors were wrong.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.792
- What do you mean?
- I'm pregnant.

01:33:27.958 --> 01:33:29.750
Oh, my God, congratulations!

01:33:30.208 --> 01:33:31.958
Oh, my God, are you serious?

01:33:32.250 --> 01:33:33.750
I'm gonna be a dad?

01:33:42.417 --> 01:33:45.458
We're not gonna start
with that again, are we?

01:33:51.375 --> 01:33:54.250
Put the top up, okay?
It's just... It's embarrassing.

01:34:00.208 --> 01:34:03.292
- Come on, come and get me.
- Freeze, right there!

01:34:05.208 --> 01:34:08.208
- Cross, cross.
- Watch it, buster.

01:34:08.375 --> 01:34:13.542
Anybody for cookie, coffee, tea?

01:34:13.708 --> 01:34:15.875
Mother, please.

01:34:17.167 --> 01:34:21.333
One of you, could
you just shoot me? Please.
