00:04.270 --> 00:06.072
RAY:
What's on the other end?

00:07.506 --> 00:09.911
CHARLOTTE:
A crazy, psychotic bitch.

00:11.109 --> 00:12.533
RAY: And you want me
to deal with her.

00:12.699 --> 00:14.074
MONTE:
If everything checks out,

00:14.212 --> 00:17.015
it'll be just like it was with Karl,
but with Ray.

00:17.082 --> 00:19.150
RAY: I want to get something
going down here.

00:19.217 --> 00:20.495
You know what I mean?

00:20.530 --> 00:21.728
TIM:
I do.

00:21.763 --> 00:22.739
RAY:
Sweet.

00:26.959 --> 00:28.893
MARCO:
Did you call in the unit?

00:28.961 --> 00:29.894
SONYA:
No.

00:29.962 --> 00:31.262
MARCO:
Is that a real police cruiser?

00:31.371 --> 00:33.998
COOPER: No. Guy must've bought
an '02 Crow Vic at auction

00:34.066 --> 00:35.264
and tricked it up
to look like one.

00:35.340 --> 00:36.467
The lab's all over it.

00:36.569 --> 00:38.414
SONYA: Gina heard her father
talking to someone

00:38.449 --> 00:39.543
before the murder.

00:39.672 --> 00:42.035
WADE: And you're thinking that
the killer was a patient, right?

00:42.575 --> 00:44.082
SONYA:
Maybe.

00:47.079 --> 00:48.446
What about his cheeks?

00:48.513 --> 00:49.681
Full? Hollow?

00:49.748 --> 00:50.882
GINA: It was dark,
I was hiding,

00:50.949 --> 00:52.783
and I only saw him
for a second.

00:52.885 --> 00:56.788
WADE: Female, Caucasian, 15 years old,
black and white sweater...

00:58.256 --> 00:59.493
SONYA:
Gina.

00:59.792 --> 01:01.546
- Gina!
- (Gina moans)

01:01.960 --> 01:03.194
Hank!

01:03.261 --> 01:04.194
Okay...

01:04.262 --> 01:05.578
MARCO: (Whispering)
He's watching us.

01:05.615 --> 01:06.886

01:30.555 --> 01:33.999
RAY: I'm digging the whole
Erykah Badu thing you got going.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.261
The turban.

01:37.329 --> 01:38.562
GRACIELA:
What do you want?

01:38.631 --> 01:40.732
RAY: Ah, I thought it would
be nice doing this in person

01:40.799 --> 01:43.046
you know,
seeing it's the first time and all.

01:51.376 --> 01:53.453
GRACIELA:
What else do you want?

01:54.546 --> 01:56.229
RAY: (Exhales)
I'm guessing I, uh,

01:56.242 --> 01:58.553
checked out
with the cowboy lawyer.

01:59.084 --> 02:01.647
GRACIELA:
Monte's very thorough.

02:02.755 --> 02:05.682
RAY: Okay.
So I check out.

02:08.026 --> 02:10.559
I'd like my money now, please.

02:22.374 --> 02:24.163
GRACIELA:
Something wrong?

02:24.844 --> 02:26.700
RAY:
I'm good.

02:27.379 --> 02:29.294
GRACIELA:
Then we're done.

02:30.215 --> 02:32.516
RAY:
Yeah, well, you know,

02:32.584 --> 02:36.429
I was thinking about getting
a little two-way commerce going.

02:36.755 --> 02:39.933
It's a shame to see that tunnel
running one way.

02:41.459 --> 02:43.456
GRACIELA:
What do you have in mind?

02:43.562 --> 02:45.462
RAY:
AR-15s.

02:45.530 --> 02:47.665
Say, 50 to start.

02:47.733 --> 02:49.572
We go from there.

02:51.570 --> 02:54.972
GRACIELA: That's not an easy weapon
to get right now.

02:55.040 --> 02:57.441
RAY: (Chuckles)
No shit.

03:01.046 --> 03:03.347
So what do you say?

03:03.415 --> 03:04.916
I got a great connect.

03:04.983 --> 03:07.952
I can deliver this week.

03:10.723 --> 03:13.525
GRACIELA: Do you have an opinion
about oral sex?

03:15.361 --> 03:17.261
(Ray chuckles)

03:17.329 --> 03:20.402
RAY: Uh, yeah.
It's, uh... it's cool.

03:22.167 --> 03:23.642
GRACIELA:
I prefer it.

03:26.238 --> 03:28.606
RAY:
Some ladies do.

03:30.042 --> 03:32.257
GRACIELA:
This will be our arrangement

03:32.338 --> 03:34.164
moving forward.

03:37.616 --> 03:40.562
RAY:
So is that a yes on the guns?

03:44.189 --> 03:45.987
GRACIELA:
<i>Depende.</i>

03:48.961 --> 03:51.307
RAY:
Is this a cartel thing?

MARCO: Yeah, maybe here,
maybe in Dallas, maybe Chicago.

05:29.232 --> 05:32.201

SONYA: She's not gonna let

Your gut should tell you that.

The car was purchased...

09:16.994 --> 09:19.135

I got something on the car.

09:19.729 --> 09:21.163
WADE:
Where's Marco at?

09:21.231 --> 09:23.161
SONYA: He went home

09:23.196 --> 09:25.667
WADE: Right.
What about the car?

09:25.735 --> 09:28.614
SONYA: They pulled three digits
of a VIN from the engine block.

09:28.718 --> 09:30.902
Doesn't match
any stolen Crown Vics.

09:31.074 --> 09:32.371
WADE:
Go on.

09:32.443 --> 09:33.877
SONYA: But I have a partial match
on a car

09:33.976 --> 09:37.833
that was sold a auction
in Las Cruces five years ago.

09:38.582 --> 09:40.983
I've been on the phone
with the auction house all morning.

09:41.051 --> 09:43.672
- They dug up the sale.
- WADE: Is there a name?

09:43.707 --> 09:45.488
SONYA:
Jack Childress.

09:45.556 --> 09:47.457
Lives out on McNutt Road.

09:47.525 --> 09:49.626
He's been on disability
for the last ten years.

09:49.693 --> 09:51.628
WADE:
Well, that's worth a look.

09:51.695 --> 09:52.862

Sorry I'm late.

It is what it is.

10:07.411 --> 10:09.345
WADE: Why don't you stick
with Sonya?

10:09.413 --> 10:12.048
She's gonna follow up
a dice lead out in the desert.

10:12.115 --> 10:14.116

10:24.962 --> 10:29.732

10:29.800 --> 10:31.233

10:31.801 --> 10:33.869
CHARLOTTE:
Did you see her?

10:33.937 --> 10:37.739
RAY:
Yeah. And I got the money.

10:37.807 --> 10:40.007
CHARLOTTE:
Did she say anything else?

10:42.980 --> 10:44.981

Nope.

10:53.757 --> 10:56.425

El Paso PD.
Open the door!

11:30.294 --> 11:33.786
El Paso PD, search warrant.
Anybody home?

11:36.533 --> 11:38.968
MARCO:
Is anybody here?

11:50.780 --> 11:53.149
What the hell is this?

12:14.037 --> 12:16.072
What's that?

12:18.075 --> 12:21.643
SONYA: The Dialectics

12:23.981 --> 12:25.781

Whoa.

12:25.849 --> 12:27.850

12:27.918 --> 12:30.319
What the hell?

12:31.289 --> 12:33.207
This is our guy.

12:56.663 --> 12:58.622

13:01.618 --> 13:03.266
ALMA:
Well...

13:05.102 --> 13:07.041
It's what we both want.

13:07.076 --> 13:08.941
Right?

13:10.238 --> 13:12.343
KENNETH:
But you're married.

13:13.931 --> 13:17.333
Um, um, we could wait...

13:17.401 --> 13:20.224
and do it right.

13:21.138 --> 13:23.672
ALMA:
What do you mean?

13:24.540 --> 13:27.576
KENNETH: If you want to get a divorce,
get a divorce.

13:27.644 --> 13:28.945
(Alma laughs quietly)

13:29.012 --> 13:32.228
ALMA:
Well, that's complicated.

13:35.285 --> 13:37.742
KENNETH:
Yeah.

13:38.788 --> 13:40.889
A little.

13:53.070 --> 13:55.471

15:00.703 --> 15:02.561
He's been to Mexico.

He calls them his "missions".

15:06.042 --> 15:09.722
MARCO: Well, I think we should bring in

15:12.449 --> 15:14.163
SONYA:
No.

15:14.315 --> 15:16.151

He's on his way.

15:16.218 --> 15:18.894
Last time we broadcast something,
he was listening.

15:20.160 --> 15:22.178
We pull back

15:22.328 --> 15:23.377

15:38.765 --> 15:41.975
you were willing to meet me

15:43.937 --> 15:47.104
LINDER:

16:24.711 --> 16:26.889
She's my daughter.

16:27.081 --> 16:29.548
She dropped out of school.

16:29.616 --> 16:32.009
She lost her way.

16:38.825 --> 16:41.260
LINDER:
Do you want me to take her?

16:41.327 --> 16:45.598
Take her to Bob's?
Against her will?

16:45.665 --> 16:49.368

I want you to talk to her.

16:49.436 --> 16:52.428

18:13.653 --> 18:14.904
(Sara giggles)

18:26.933 --> 18:28.541

18:40.881 --> 18:42.047
LINDER:
Shh. Easy...

18:44.117 --> 18:47.285
LINDER: Don't...
Don't be scared.

18:49.422 --> 18:51.524
Your mother sent me.

18:51.591 --> 18:53.993
SARA:
What the hell?

18:54.060 --> 18:56.629
LINDER: She wants a better life
for you.

18:56.696 --> 18:59.798
So do I.

18:59.866 --> 19:02.234
SARA:
I know who you are.

19:02.301 --> 19:05.337
You're my mother's
stupid gringo coyote.

19:05.405 --> 19:07.372
LINDER:
Well, I don't consider myself...

19:07.440 --> 19:10.743
SARA: I met you
at my <i>quinceañera</i>, idiot.

19:10.810 --> 19:11.911
LINDER:
Oh, yeah.

19:11.978 --> 19:14.980
SARA: My boyfriend's gonna kill you
for talking to me.

19:15.048 --> 19:16.682
LINDER:
Yeah, well, I'm sure

19:16.750 --> 19:18.607
that your boyfriend's
a very scary person,

19:18.642 --> 19:20.753
and he's welcome to try.
But you need to come with me.

19:20.820 --> 19:22.102
SARA:
No, no.

19:24.090 --> 19:26.091
(Sara panting)

19:28.562 --> 19:31.030
LINDER:
Damn it. Oh, shit

19:31.097 --> 19:33.265
(Both panting)

19:34.288 --> 19:35.568
SARA:
I don't want to go, okay.

19:35.635 --> 19:38.218
So tell my mom to stop
this shit, okay.

19:40.139 --> 19:43.300
LINDER:
I am trying to help you.

19:47.914 --> 19:49.789
SARA:
Okay.

19:55.957 --> 19:59.024
(Tires screech)

20:08.468 --> 20:11.269
(Sara speaking Spanish)

20:11.270 --> 20:13.305
WADE: Childress lives
at the top of that hill.

20:13.372 --> 20:15.429
COOPER: Most of these
look abandoned.

20:15.543 --> 20:16.518
WADE:
Well, they are.

20:16.624 --> 20:18.104
Chemical spill
sent the sane ones

20:18.218 --> 20:20.220
running from the area
about ten years ago.

20:20.580 --> 20:22.302
What the hell?

20:28.121 --> 20:31.686
COOPER: Who the hell leaves a truck
in the middle of the road?

20:37.731 --> 20:40.165
He left one rifle
in the window.

20:54.413 --> 20:56.581
Registered to Jack Childress.

20:56.650 --> 20:57.850
McNutt Road.

20:57.917 --> 20:59.351
WADE:
Son of a bitch.

20:59.418 --> 21:01.687
Get Sonya and Marco down here
right now.

21:01.755 --> 21:02.939
COOPER:
Yes, sir.

21:03.957 --> 21:05.090
Hey, it's Coop.

21:05.158 --> 21:08.093
We got Childress's abandoned truck
down here outside Lost Oasis.

21:08.161 --> 21:10.095
Come on up
and let's take a look.

21:10.163 --> 21:12.164
We're a quarter mile
down the road.

21:20.040 --> 21:20.973
ADRIANA:
Hey.

21:21.041 --> 21:21.974
Jack Childress.

21:22.042 --> 21:24.016
Source told me
the police are looking at him.

21:24.035 --> 21:25.480
I'm not sure what's up.

21:27.182 --> 21:28.847
FRYE:
It's not what I expected.

21:28.915 --> 21:29.848
ADRIANA:
What do you mean?

21:29.916 --> 21:31.950
FRYE: What's the connection
between him and Gedman?

21:32.018 --> 21:34.853
Or the shrink or Marco Ruiz,

21:34.921 --> 21:36.521
body 23, me even?

21:36.589 --> 21:37.656
ADRIANA:
We don't know yet.

21:37.724 --> 21:40.025
FRYE: There are no coincidences
with this guy.

21:40.093 --> 21:42.828
(Shudders)

21:42.896 --> 21:45.541
ADRIANA: Come on,
let's go to his house.

21:48.434 --> 21:50.836
(Frye huffs)

21:50.904 --> 21:52.004
FRYE:
Tell you what, you go.

21:52.072 --> 21:54.073
I don't know if you've noticed,
but my brain ain't right

21:54.140 --> 21:56.875
I can't write a sentence
to save my life, and I got...

21:56.943 --> 21:59.878
I got this mother of a headache
that won't go away.

21:59.946 --> 22:03.281
My body's basically giving me
the middle finger for getting clean.

22:03.780 --> 22:05.186
ADRIANA: Maybe you should
go see a doctor.

22:05.221 --> 22:06.363
FRYE: Oh, yeah, why?
So he can tell me

22:06.398 --> 22:08.649
I'm an alcoholic drug addict
that's all broken?

22:08.755 --> 22:10.589
No, thanks.

22:10.656 --> 22:12.858
ADRIANA:
Frye, this is the story.

22:12.926 --> 22:14.646
- FRYE: I know...
- (Toaster pops)

22:14.965 --> 22:16.410
I know.

22:20.834 --> 22:22.667
It's your story now.

22:22.736 --> 22:24.903
Go get them, tiger.

22:24.971 --> 22:27.239
Ow!
(Grunts)

22:30.343 --> 22:31.910
Three-second rule.

22:31.978 --> 22:34.913
You can have it.

22:34.981 --> 22:37.916
WADE: We go in pairs,
trailer by trailer.

22:37.984 --> 22:40.719
Make sure he ain't hiding
in any of these tin cans.

22:40.787 --> 22:41.920
COOPER:
Yes, sir.

22:41.988 --> 22:43.863
WADE: The last time
we called the cavalry,

22:43.898 --> 22:46.352
a little girl got killed.
Remember that.

22:46.793 --> 22:47.860
MARCO:
Oh, <i>gracias</i>.

22:47.927 --> 22:48.861
Thank you.

22:48.928 --> 22:49.862
WADE:
<i>De nada.</i>

22:49.929 --> 22:51.997
- SONYA: Hank...
- WADE: Don't worry about it.

23:04.878 --> 23:06.812
WADE: Deputy Stokes,
what are you doing here?

23:06.880 --> 23:07.813
STOKES:
I got a call

23:07.881 --> 23:09.815
about that truck
in the middle of the road.

23:09.883 --> 23:11.817
- What's going on?
- COOPER: Hey, man.

23:11.885 --> 23:13.952
WADE: Uh, we got the suspect
in the park here.

23:14.020 --> 23:15.954
STOKES:
The Bridge Butcher?

23:16.022 --> 23:17.055
WADE:
Manny, do me a favor.

23:17.123 --> 23:19.491
Secure the entrance
and the trucks, all right?

23:19.558 --> 23:20.492
STOKES:
You got it.

23:20.559 --> 23:22.649
WADE:
Good deal. Let's go.

23:23.729 --> 23:25.998
(Stokes exhales)

23:26.065 --> 23:27.800
WADE:
Good morning.

23:27.867 --> 23:28.967
(Stokes exhales)

23:29.035 --> 23:29.968
STOKES:
Time to shine.

23:30.036 --> 23:30.969
(Knock on door)

23:31.037 --> 23:32.971
SONYA: El Paso PD.
Open the door.

23:33.039 --> 23:35.974
(Dog yapping inside the trailer)

23:36.951 --> 23:38.502
Ma'am, is anyone else
in there with you?

23:38.537 --> 23:39.978
- WOMAN: No, ma'am.
- SONYA: All right.

23:40.046 --> 23:40.979
(Dog yapping)

23:41.047 --> 23:42.031
WOMAN:
Seabiscuit.

23:42.248 --> 23:42.981
Seabiscuit!

23:43.049 --> 23:44.983
- SONYA: Ma'am...
- WOMAN: Goddamn it.

23:45.051 --> 23:47.659
SONYA: Please go inside
and lock the door.

23:51.024 --> 23:53.192
(Electronic music blaring)

24:11.077 --> 24:13.078
WADE:
Turn the music down.

24:20.119 --> 24:23.021
COOPER:
Bath salts.

24:23.089 --> 24:24.256
(Music stops)

24:24.324 --> 24:26.124
MAN:
Man!

24:26.192 --> 24:28.360
Oh...

24:29.189 --> 24:30.832
MARCO:
<i>Nada.</i>

24:31.397 --> 24:32.831
STOKES:
Hey.

24:32.899 --> 24:34.612
Detectives.

24:36.569 --> 24:38.441
I went back to the truck.

24:39.105 --> 24:40.965
Found this.

24:41.741 --> 24:44.076
This is a bone saw.

24:44.143 --> 24:47.144
That's used for wild game, deer,
vermin, whatnot.

24:47.182 --> 24:48.496
SONYA:
Bag it.

24:49.215 --> 24:50.983
STOKES:
Listen. I just...

24:51.050 --> 24:52.751
Detective!

24:52.818 --> 24:55.287
MAN:
I'll eat your face off!

24:56.956 --> 25:00.225
COOPER: That sock don't even cover
your nut sack.

25:02.161 --> 25:03.028
SONYA:
That's not him.

25:03.096 --> 25:04.729
WADE: Nope.
But he knows him.

25:04.797 --> 25:07.532
COOPER: Says Childress ran through here
about ten minutes ago.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.527
SONYA:
Where was he going?

25:10.303 --> 25:12.404
MAN:
North edge of the park.

25:12.471 --> 25:14.072
Bunch of vacants down there.

25:14.140 --> 25:16.208
He stays in 'em
when he's having a crazy day.

25:16.276 --> 25:17.242
SONYA:
How often is that?

25:17.310 --> 25:18.243
MAN:
A lot!

25:18.311 --> 25:20.312
And that psycho's armed.

25:22.282 --> 25:24.283
COOPER:
Stay.

25:31.424 --> 25:32.857
MARCO:
Nope, nothing.

25:32.926 --> 25:35.104
No sign of him.

25:36.595 --> 25:37.796
WADE:
Well, if he's on foot,

25:37.863 --> 25:40.065
he's not gonna get far
in this heat.

25:40.133 --> 25:42.067
MARCO: Or maybe
he's got a car waiting?

25:42.135 --> 25:44.069
SONYA: We need to get
in contact with him.

25:44.137 --> 25:46.438
WADE:
How are we gonna do that?

25:47.734 --> 25:49.180
SONYA:
Call him.

25:49.785 --> 25:51.910
MARCO: You really think
he's gonna answer?

25:51.978 --> 25:54.279
SONYA: Well,
he likes the attention.

25:54.347 --> 25:58.317
This is what
he's been preparing for, so...

25:58.384 --> 25:59.884
STOKES:
Detective Ruiz!

25:59.953 --> 26:02.754
MARCO: Yes, Deputy?
You got something?

26:02.822 --> 26:05.890
STOKES:
Uh... well... no.

26:05.959 --> 26:07.892
But, uh, yeah.

26:07.961 --> 26:09.894
Yeah, I just...
I got a quick question for you.

26:09.963 --> 26:10.895
MARCO:
Oh.

26:10.964 --> 26:13.069
STOKES:
I don't know if you noticed,

26:13.104 --> 26:15.868
but I got my braces off
this morning.

26:15.935 --> 26:17.469
MARCO:
No, I did not notice.

26:17.536 --> 26:19.571
STOKES: Well, the reason
I bring it up...

26:19.638 --> 26:21.650
Well, I was in there getting 'em
popped off,

26:21.685 --> 26:23.479
and while they were
popping 'em off,

26:23.514 --> 26:27.007
I just had the wildest,
strangest, uh...

26:27.042 --> 26:28.898
daydream...
I think that's what you call it...

26:28.933 --> 26:30.349
- MARCO: Okay...
- STOKES: ...about this case.

26:30.416 --> 26:32.351
STOKES:
No, no, no, listen.

26:32.418 --> 26:33.979
So... and basically
what I was thinking

26:34.014 --> 26:35.613
was that if you were the killer,

26:35.745 --> 26:37.821
and you were to go
to all this trouble...

26:37.994 --> 26:41.360
to-to do the beads,
and-and all these messages...

26:41.627 --> 26:43.327
(Gunshot)

26:46.130 --> 26:48.554
(Marco speaks Spanish)

26:48.701 --> 26:50.869
MARCO:
Son of a bitch!

26:52.787 --> 26:56.033
WADE: Shots fired!
Shots fired! Man down!

26:56.101 --> 26:58.357
- SONYA: Move! Move!
- MARCO: Son of a bitch!

26:58.499 --> 26:59.970
(Gunshot)

27:00.406 --> 27:01.757
CHILDRESS:
White.

27:03.031 --> 27:04.299
Brown.

27:06.177 --> 27:09.312

27:13.785 --> 27:15.786
(Gunshot)

27:17.022 --> 27:19.123
(Gunshot)

27:21.693 --> 27:23.928
(Gunshot)

27:28.700 --> 27:30.590
MARCO: (Panting)
Shit.

27:31.937 --> 27:33.919
WADE:
Come on, now.

27:36.542 --> 27:40.577
WADE: 500 yards. Top of the hill.
Brown house.

27:40.645 --> 27:42.402
He's tucked up
against that water tower.

27:45.817 --> 27:48.185
He's back
in his goddamn house.

27:48.253 --> 27:49.937
Shit.

27:50.022 --> 27:51.594
Shit, shit.

27:53.324 --> 27:55.748
COOPER:
Damn it, Stokes.

28:01.032 --> 28:03.354
WADE: McNutt Road,
north end of the trailer park.

28:03.432 --> 28:05.122
Officer down.

28:09.607 --> 28:11.909
MARCO: Forget it!
Let's go get him.

28:11.977 --> 28:13.911
WADE: SWAT's gonna be here
in 20 minutes.

28:13.979 --> 28:15.255
COOPER:
He'll be gone by then.

28:15.368 --> 28:18.237
MARCO: So let's go get him!
Forget the SWAT!

28:21.287 --> 28:22.520
SONYA:
Jack.

28:22.588 --> 28:24.689
CHILDRESS:
You're on with Jack.

28:25.758 --> 28:26.691
SONYA:
I got him!

28:26.759 --> 28:27.992
WADE:
Marco...

28:28.494 --> 28:30.251
Come on.

28:30.962 --> 28:32.196
SONYA:
Be careful.

28:32.264 --> 28:34.672
I'll keep him distracted.

28:37.035 --> 28:38.969
SONYA: I need you to listen
to me.

28:39.037 --> 28:40.526
CHILDRESS:
Oh...

28:40.861 --> 28:43.708
Yeah, I-I don't know about that.

28:43.875 --> 28:46.844
I see you.

28:50.783 --> 28:52.726
I could kill you.

28:54.620 --> 28:57.152
Almost isn't sporting, is it?

29:02.160 --> 29:05.229
- SONYA: It's over.
- CHILDRESS: Yeah.

29:05.297 --> 29:07.732
Yeah, the end
is already determined.

29:07.800 --> 29:08.733
SONYA:
You killed a cop.

29:08.801 --> 29:10.768
That means cops
are coming to kill you.

29:10.836 --> 29:12.770
CHILDRESS:
Well, you invaded my land.

29:12.838 --> 29:14.806
Maybe you got it backwards.

29:14.873 --> 29:17.074
SONYA: A SWAT team's
on their way.

29:17.531 --> 29:19.830
CHILDRESS: Yep.
I'm sure they are.

29:19.865 --> 29:21.245
But they're late.

29:21.313 --> 29:22.947
I'm in control.

29:23.014 --> 29:24.949
SONYA: Listen,
you want to tell your story?

29:25.016 --> 29:26.351
This is not the way to do it.

29:26.418 --> 29:28.519
They will kill you.

29:29.087 --> 29:31.488
CHILDRESS:
Mm-hmm.

29:34.341 --> 29:36.111
SONYA:
I can still stop them.

29:42.589 --> 29:44.668
COOPER: All right, boss.
How we gonna do this?

29:44.736 --> 29:46.703
WADE: She's talking to him
on the phone.

29:46.771 --> 29:48.705
We're gonna give her
five minutes.

29:48.773 --> 29:51.808
COOPER: You think she's gonna
talk him out of anything?

29:51.877 --> 29:53.543
WADE:
Five minutes.

29:53.611 --> 29:55.209
COOPER:
Yes, sir.

29:56.047 --> 29:58.463
SONYA:
Why'd you stop talking, Jack?

29:59.851 --> 30:02.786
Would it help
if you could see me?

30:02.854 --> 30:06.521

30:12.264 --> 30:14.290
CHILDRESS: (Laughs)
Why?

30:15.867 --> 30:17.201
Why?

30:17.269 --> 30:19.636
Because I am the truth.

30:20.939 --> 30:22.290

Truth?

CHILDRESS: El Paso del Norte

30:31.049 --> 30:34.985
by borders,

by history.

30:36.388 --> 30:38.389
SONYA: What you're doing
won't change that.

30:38.456 --> 30:39.423

on your missions?

Impressive.

30:45.130 --> 30:47.998
Well, you know, parasite,

so many people, Jack?

30:58.643 --> 31:00.710

happening here.

31:00.778 --> 31:02.046
At the border.

31:02.113 --> 31:04.448
And no one seems
to know about it.

31:04.515 --> 31:06.951
I want the truth to come out.

31:28.940 --> 31:30.540

You still have time.

31:30.608 --> 31:34.311

33:22.615 --> 33:24.149
We got him.

SONYA: I'm just not sure that
the man who planned all this...

33:42.769 --> 33:44.963

33:44.998 --> 33:48.107
MARCO: We have the bone saw
and the car.

33:48.174 --> 33:51.009
You saw the writing

Don't mind me.

35:16.662 --> 35:19.031
CESAR: Is there something wrong,

Uh, here.

35:21.868 --> 35:22.868
CESAR:
What's this?

35:22.936 --> 35:24.415
CHARLOTTE:
That's your salary.

35:24.490 --> 35:26.110
CESAR:
Ah.

35:26.306 --> 35:30.435
CHARLOTTE: And that's
your cut of the tunnel.

35:32.979 --> 35:35.704
- CESAR: It's okay.
- CHARLOTTE: We're partners.

35:37.116 --> 35:39.905
I assume you didn't have
this arrangement with Karl.

35:40.553 --> 35:42.554
CESAR:
No.

35:50.263 --> 35:52.075

I'm doing the right thing?

35:58.304 --> 36:00.439

the only thing.

36:04.878 --> 36:06.245

with Graciela.

36:08.447 --> 36:10.318

Do you trust him?

36:13.819 --> 36:16.755

Why?

36:16.822 --> 36:19.258
CESAR:
It's nothing.

36:19.325 --> 36:21.760
CHARLOTTE: We're partners.
Say it.

36:21.827 --> 36:23.862
CESAR: I don't think
it's such a good idea

36:23.899 --> 36:26.120
to let him deal with Graciela.

36:28.334 --> 36:31.669
<i>Señor</i> Karl had a way
of controlling her.

36:35.308 --> 36:37.594

to be careful.

36:40.781 --> 36:42.290

COOPER:
Stokes was a moron,

37:06.973 --> 37:09.852
but he didn't deserve
to get his head blowed off.

37:11.545 --> 37:13.488
WADE:
Yeah.

37:14.880 --> 37:16.956

37:25.458 --> 37:26.992

Is it?

37:27.060 --> 37:29.494
WADE:
Yep.

37:29.562 --> 37:31.449
COOPER: That dude is gonna
plead insanity

37:31.484 --> 37:34.599
and spend the rest of his life
beating off and knitting socks.

37:34.667 --> 37:37.479
WADE: Well, if that's what happens,
that's what happens.

37:38.671 --> 37:41.773
COOPER: Sonya should've shot him
between the eyes.

37:41.841 --> 37:44.535
WADE: Yeah, and that would've
made him dead.

37:46.178 --> 37:49.547
COOPER: I don't see the problem
with that, Hank.

38:01.494 --> 38:03.895

38:20.513 --> 38:22.296
CHARLOTTE:

No, not better.

38:44.203 --> 38:46.280
I would, uh... I would
definitely classify it

38:46.353 --> 38:48.008
as worse, actually.

38:48.107 --> 38:49.741
Huh?

38:49.808 --> 38:53.017
Well, yeah, of course
I'll help you file your story.

38:53.579 --> 38:55.529
