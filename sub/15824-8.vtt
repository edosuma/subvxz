WEBVTT

00:30.098 --> 00:31.665
GABRIEL:
That's it.

00:50.651 --> 00:51.852
THANK YOU.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.054
GAVE US
A VISITOR'S PASS.

01:04.398 --> 01:07.067
[ INDISTINCT SHOUTING,
WOLF

01:23.851 --> 01:27.721
STOP! EYES LEFT!

01:27.755 --> 01:29.690
MAN, I HATE
BEING IN HERE.

01:29.723 --> 01:31.659
AND WITHOUT A GUN, TOO.

01:31.692 --> 01:35.163
[ INDISTINCT SHOUTING
CONTINUES ]

01:40.468 --> 01:42.303
RAY DIAMOND?

01:42.336 --> 01:44.572
I'M DEPUTY CHIEF BRENDA JOHNSON.
THIS IS DETECTIVE GABRIEL.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.474
IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU SHOWED UP.

01:46.507 --> 01:49.210
WHY? DID YOU HAVE OTHER PLANS
FOR THE EVENING?

01:50.611 --> 01:53.347
WHERE'S YOUR ATTORNEY,
MR. DIAMOND?

01:53.381 --> 01:55.549
YEAH, I'M PRO PER.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.451
YOU'RE REPRESENTING
YOURSELF?

01:57.485 --> 01:59.587
WHICH MEANS I CAN
SPEND ALL DAY IN THE
LAW LIBRARY IF I WANT TO,

01:59.620 --> 02:01.522
WHICH IS WHERE EVERYONE
THINKS I AM RIGHT NOW.

02:01.555 --> 02:04.158
COME ON,
LET'S GET THIS THING STARTED!

02:04.192 --> 02:07.428
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO TELL US?

02:07.461 --> 02:10.831
OKAY, I GOT SOME INFORMATION
ON A MURDER-FOR-HIRE,

02:10.864 --> 02:13.434
WHICH I'M WILLING TO GIVE UP
IN EXCHANGE

02:13.467 --> 02:15.169
FOR THE D.A. DROPPING
HIS THIRD STRIKE AGAINST ME.

02:15.203 --> 02:16.537
SO, GO GET MY DEAL,
COME ON BACK...

02:16.570 --> 02:17.938
TELL YOU
EVERYTHING I KNOW.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.840
ARE YOU CRAZY?
WE JUST GOT HERE.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.742
DID YOU HEAR THE CLANGING
ON THE PIPES WHEN Y'ALL
WALKED IN HERE?!

02:21.775 --> 02:23.177
BING BANG
BINGITY

02:23.211 --> 02:24.478
WHOLE JOINT KNOWS
YOU'RE IN THE HOUSE.

02:24.512 --> 02:25.846
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
WHEN THEY FIND OUT

02:25.879 --> 02:27.281
THAT I'M THE PERSON
TALKING TO YOU?

02:27.315 --> 02:28.316
WHAT HAPPENS TO ME
THEN?

02:29.483 --> 02:31.485
HAVE YOU ALREADY BEEN ATTACKED
BY YOUR FELLOW PRISONERS?

02:31.519 --> 02:32.786
YOUR FACE
LOOKS LIKE A MESS.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.455
NO, NO, I GOT THAT
WHEN Y'ALL ARRESTED ME.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.190
THAT WAS THE TOUGHEST BUST
I EVER TOOK.

02:36.224 --> 02:38.426
THAT WAS
A STUPID CAR CHASE.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.194
NO, I'M SAFE FOR NOW.

02:40.228 --> 02:41.762
YOU ALL BETTER HURRY,
GET THE D.A. BACK
HERE WITH A DEAL,

02:41.795 --> 02:43.297
'CAUSE, BELIEVE ME,
IT'S WORTH IT.

02:43.331 --> 02:46.200
MR. DIAMOND,
THIS EVENING ALREADY RANKS

02:46.234 --> 02:47.535
AS ONE OF THE LOW POINTS
OF MY LIFE.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.237
I'M NOT COMING BACK.

02:49.270 --> 02:51.739
IF YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING
TO TELL ME AND YOU WANT MY HELP,

02:51.772 --> 02:53.941
GO AHEAD,
FASCINATE ME.

02:53.974 --> 02:55.776
Gabriel: MAYBE YOU CAN START
WITH THE VICTIM

02:55.809 --> 02:56.844
IN THIS
MURDER-FOR-HIRE.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.479
WHO WAS IT?

02:58.512 --> 03:01.282
NOT "WHO WAS THE VICTIM?" MAN.
"WHO IS."

03:02.416 --> 03:04.785
I'M TALKING ABOUT STOPPING
A MURDER FROM HAPPENING.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.322
WE'RE LISTENING.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.861
SEE, WHENEVER
I COME BACK HERE,

03:13.894 --> 03:16.964
I'M A TRUSTEE, WHICH MEANS
I GET TO MOVE AROUND A LOT.

03:16.997 --> 03:19.400
ONE DAY, I'M SPOONING CHILI
IN THE MESS HALL.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.369
NEXT DAY, I'M MOPPING FLOORS
IN HIGH-POWER.

03:21.402 --> 03:24.372
SEE, EVERYBODY KNOWS ME,
OR KNOWS OF ME.

03:24.405 --> 03:25.973
AND I CAN GET VISITORS,

03:26.006 --> 03:27.608
WHICH MEANS IF YOU NEED TO
GET WORD OUT TO THE STREET

03:27.641 --> 03:28.909
TO SOMEONE,
I'M A GO-TO GUY.

03:30.010 --> 03:33.013
SO, LAST NIGHT,
I GET A KITE TO PASS ON.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.648
AND BECAUSE IT'S FROM
THIS POWERFUL CAT,

03:34.682 --> 03:36.484
I TAKE A LOOK...

03:36.517 --> 03:38.519
AND I READ THE MESSAGE...

03:38.552 --> 03:41.322
ORDERING A HIT
ON THE OUTSIDE.

03:42.290 --> 03:43.824
AND IT ALL GOES DOWN
TOMORROW.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.693
TOMORROW.

03:45.726 --> 03:46.927
OKAY,
LET ME SEE THIS KITE.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.529
NO, I HAD TO LET IT FLY,
BABY.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.464
YOU KNOWINGLY PASSED ON ORDERS
FOR A MURDER?

03:50.498 --> 03:52.966
IF I HADN'T, I'D BE
DEAD MYSELF ALREADY!
THAT'S THE HAND TO GOD!

03:53.000 --> 03:55.303
OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
WHO'S THE TARGET?

03:59.340 --> 04:01.609
A D.A. AND A DEAL --

04:01.642 --> 04:03.477
THAT'S WHAT I WANT --

04:03.511 --> 04:05.779
ON PAPER, LEGITIMATE.

04:05.813 --> 04:10.518
MR. DIAMOND, IT'S INTERESTING
YOU USE THE WORD "LEGITIMATE."

04:10.551 --> 04:11.952
I'VE BEEN STUDYING YOUR JACKET,

04:11.985 --> 04:14.688
AND YOU HAVE BEEN
CONVICTED OF PERJURY TWICE --

04:14.722 --> 04:16.390
THE LAST TIME,

04:16.424 --> 04:17.691
FOR PROVIDING FALSE INFORMATION
ABOUT A HOMICIDE.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.427
AND HERE YOU ARE NOW --

04:19.460 --> 04:22.463
HAVING VIOLATED YOUR PAROLE
AND FACING A THIRD STRIKE --

04:22.496 --> 04:24.598
AND SUDDENLY YOU'VE GOT A STORY
ABOUT ANOTHER MURDER?

04:24.632 --> 04:26.567
I KNOW. YOU WANT A SHOW
OF GOOD FAITH, RIGHT?

04:26.600 --> 04:28.469
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
SOMETHING TO WHET YOUR BEAK,

04:28.502 --> 04:29.737
BUT Y'ALL BETTER HURRY,

04:29.770 --> 04:31.372
'CAUSE YOU ONLY GOT
TILL TOMORROW.

04:31.405 --> 04:35.609
THE MURDER HAS
SOMETHING TO DO WITH...

04:35.643 --> 04:39.713
CASE NUMBER BA120368.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.817
LOOK IT UP.

04:43.851 --> 04:46.954
Diamond: BA120368.

04:48.456 --> 04:49.823
BA120368.

04:49.857 --> 04:52.426
IT'S A CASE
BEFORE THE SUPERIOR COURT --

04:52.460 --> 04:54.595
CALIFORNIA vs.
A ROBERT CURTIS.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.063
HE'S THE ALLEGED BANKER

04:56.096 --> 04:57.865
FOR THE GARCIA DRUG CARTEL'S
AMERICAN OPERATIONS.

04:57.898 --> 05:00.768
MR. CURTIS IS FACING SO MANY
COUNTS OF MONEY LAUNDERING,

05:00.801 --> 05:02.703
HE COULD GO TO JAIL
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE,

05:02.736 --> 05:04.872
OR HE COULD BE COOPERATING
WITH THE D.A.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.475
WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN WHY
THE CARTEL WOULD WANT HIM DEAD.

05:07.508 --> 05:10.478
BUT THIS, UH --
THIS DIAMOND GUY,

05:10.511 --> 05:12.946
WHO, BY ALL ACCOUNTS,
IS A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR,

05:12.980 --> 05:15.816
IS IN JAIL, WHERE THIS MIGHT
ALL BE COMMON KNOWLEDGE.

05:15.849 --> 05:18.051
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK HE'S NOT
JUST LOOKING FOR A LIKELY TARGET

05:18.085 --> 05:19.820
AND TRYING TO GAME
THE SYSTEM AGAIN?

05:19.853 --> 05:21.555
MR. DIAMOND GAVE HIS CASE NUMBER
FROM MEMORY.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.023
DOESN'T THAT AT LEAST
WARRANT A FOLLOW

05:23.056 --> 05:24.558
WE'VE BEEN WORKING
THROUGH THE NIGHT,

05:24.592 --> 05:26.527
TRYING TO PREVENT
A MURDER --

05:26.560 --> 05:29.830
ALL RIGHT, WHO'S PROSECUTING
THIS, UH, BANKER GUY,
MISTER, UH, CURTIS?

05:29.863 --> 05:31.532
DDA HOBBS.

05:31.565 --> 05:34.134
GREAT. YOU KNOW HOBBS. CALL HER.
GIVE HER THE INFORMATION.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.970
BETWEEN THE D.A.'s OFFICE
AND THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT,

05:37.004 --> 05:39.373
THEY HAVE PLENTY OF RESOURCES
TO TAKE OVER THIS INVESTIGATION.

05:39.407 --> 05:41.008
WHY WOULD THEY TAKE OVER
THE INVESTIGATION?

05:41.041 --> 05:42.510
BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS
IN JAIL

05:42.543 --> 05:44.077
IS THE SHERIFF'S PROBLEM,
NOT OURS.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.780
BUT THIS CASE WAS BROUGHT
DIRECTLY TO THE L.A.P.D.

05:46.814 --> 05:49.049
YEAH, BY A SNITCH
IN THE COUNTY JAIL,

05:49.082 --> 05:50.751
WITH INFORMATION
ABOUT A COUNTY CASE,

05:50.784 --> 05:52.820
LOOKING TO MAKE A DEAL
WITH THE COUNTY PROSECUTOR.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.555
COUNTY, COUNTY, COUNTY.

05:54.588 --> 05:57.057
CHIEF, SIR,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

05:57.090 --> 06:00.828
RAY DIAMOND TOOK A HUGE RISK
REACHING OUT TO US LAST NIGHT.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.730
WE PROMISED HIM
THAT WE WOULD FOLLOW UP.

06:02.763 --> 06:06.467
WHICH YOU WILL DO BY TELLING
DDA HOBBS ALL ABOUT IT.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.602
LOOK, I'LL SHARE A SECRET
WITH YOU.

06:08.636 --> 06:11.772
THE CITY AND THE L.A.P.D.
ARE BROKE, OUT OF MONEY.

06:11.805 --> 06:14.508
NOW, IF THIS SNITCH HAD COME
TO YOU IN OUR JURISDICTION,

06:14.542 --> 06:18.011
IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT,
BUT HE DIDN'T, SO IT'S NOT.

06:18.045 --> 06:21.415
HE IS PHYSICALLY
AND FINANCIALLY THE PROBLEM

06:21.449 --> 06:23.451
OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
OF THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES,

06:23.484 --> 06:26.754
TO WHOM MAJOR CRIMES
WILL IMMEDIATELY

06:26.787 --> 06:28.856
HAND OFF
THIS INVESTIGATION.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.859
CHIEF, WE HAVE UPDATES
ON THE RAY DIAMOND CASE.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.995
AS A TRUSTEE, DIAMOND HAS ACCESS
TO ALL PARTS OF THE JAIL,

06:35.028 --> 06:36.730
INCLUDING HIGH--

06:36.764 --> 06:38.131
INCLUDING HIGH-POWER,

06:38.165 --> 06:39.700
WHERE AT LEAST SIX
KNOWN ASSOCIATES

06:39.733 --> 06:41.068
OF THE GARCIA CARTEL
ARE HOUSED.

06:41.101 --> 06:44.204
HIGH-POWER DETAINEES
DON'T GET PHONE CALLS,

06:44.237 --> 06:45.673
AND THEY DON'T GET
OUT-OF-CELL TIME,

06:45.706 --> 06:47.508
SO THEY WOULD USE A GUY
LIKE DIAMOND

06:47.541 --> 06:48.742
TO GET
THEIR MESSAGES OUT.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.944
UH, CAPTAIN,
RAY DIAMOND IS A PRISONER

06:50.978 --> 06:52.580
THAT WE'RE HOLDING
IN COUNTY.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.582
HERE'S HIS JACKET.
GOOD.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.784
Flynn:
THE L.A.P.D. AND THE FBI

06:56.817 --> 06:58.986
HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING
THE GARCIAS FOR YEARS.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.655
THEY'RE LIKE DIRTBAG, INC.
AND IT'S NOT JUST DRUGS.

07:01.689 --> 07:04.692
THEY TRAFFIC IN PEOPLE AND GUNS,
AND THEY'RE REALLY RICH.

07:04.725 --> 07:07.495
THAT'S WHERE THE BANKER,
ROBERT CURTIS, COMES INTO PLAY.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.497
ACCORDING TO THIS INDICTMENT,

07:09.530 --> 07:12.065
IT WAS HIS RESPONSIBILITY TO
MANAGE ALL THE CARTEL'S MONEY.

07:12.099 --> 07:15.068
YEAH, HE PROBABLY SET HIMSELF UP
A GREAT PENSION PLAN.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.037
YOU'RE NOT TOO FAR OFF,
LIEUTENANT.

07:17.070 --> 07:21.041
THE GARCIAS DO RUN THE CARTEL
LIKE A MAJOR CORPORATION,

07:21.074 --> 07:22.776
AND THEY HAVE THEMSELVES
SUBPOENAED

07:22.810 --> 07:24.912
FROM ALL OVER THE PRISON SYSTEM
TO THE L.A. COUNTY JAIL,

07:24.945 --> 07:27.681
WHERE THEY HAVE THESE
BOARD-OF-DIRECTORS MEETINGS.

07:27.715 --> 07:30.818
AND IT LOOKS TO US LIKE YOUR,
UH, BANKER, ROBERT CURTIS,

07:30.851 --> 07:33.153
HAD SOLE CONTROL
OVER THEIR AMERICAN FINANCES.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.988
NOW, IF HE'S LOOKING
TO MAKE A DEAL,

07:35.022 --> 07:37.858
WE COULD USE HIS TESTIMONY
TO HELP TRACK AND CONFISCATE

07:37.891 --> 07:39.960
THE CARTEL'S MONEY
WORLDWIDE.

07:39.993 --> 07:43.564
OKAY, SO,
WE HAVE A GARCIA CARTEL

07:43.597 --> 07:45.265
BOARD-OF-DIRECTORS MEETING
GOING ON RIGHT NOW

07:45.298 --> 07:46.767
IN L.A. COUNTY JAIL'S
HIGH-POWER.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.001
OKAY,
SO THEY MUST HAVE HEARD

07:48.035 --> 07:49.903
THAT THE BANKER'S
TURNING AGAINST THEM.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.505
SO THEY SEND OUT THE ORDER
TO KILL HIM

07:51.539 --> 07:53.240
WITH A KITE THEY PASS
THROUGH RAY DIAMOND.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.010
WHERE'S MR. CURTIS
RIGHT NOW?

07:57.044 --> 07:58.912
IN AN UNDISCLOSED
LOCATION.

07:58.946 --> 08:01.682
AND HIS HEARING ISN'T
LISTED ON THE TRIAL-COURT
INFORMATION SYSTEM.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.851
PROBABLY BECAUSE IT'S
SEQUESTERED FOR HIS
OWN PROTECTION.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.786
SO HE IS MAKING A DEAL.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.888
WELL, CHIEF, YOUR SNITCH
IS STARTING TO LOOK A
LITTLE MORE CREDIBLE.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.057
WHAT?

08:11.324 --> 08:12.960
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

08:12.993 --> 08:15.095
WELL, ACCORDING TO CHIEF POPE,
THIS IS THE COUNTY'S CASE.

08:15.128 --> 08:17.197
HE JUST WANTS US TO HAND OVER
ALL OUR INFORMATION

08:17.230 --> 08:19.299
TO DDA HOBBS AND LET HER
JUST RUN THE SHOW.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.535
CAPTAIN RAYDOR?
CHIEF JOHNSON?

08:21.569 --> 08:23.203
I HAVE A COMPLAINT.
WHEN HAVE YOU NOT?

08:23.236 --> 08:25.072
IN OUR INTERVIEW
WITH MR. DIAMOND,

08:25.105 --> 08:27.641
HE SAID THAT, AFTER LEADING
THE POLICE ON A CAR CHASE,

08:27.675 --> 08:29.810
HE WAS BEATEN
BEFORE HE WAS ARRESTED.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.946
COME ON, CHIEF,
DIAMOND PROBABLY DUMPED THE CAR

08:32.980 --> 08:34.715
AT SOME POINT
AND TRIED TO RUN AWAY.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.617
WHEN YOU TACKLE A SUSPECT LIKE
THAT, THERE'S BOUND TO BE --

08:36.650 --> 08:39.086
LIEUTENANT FLYNN,
THIS BRUISE UNDERNEATH HIS EYE

08:39.119 --> 08:41.121
AND THE CUT ON HIS FOREHEAD
INDICATE

08:41.154 --> 08:45.125
A POSSIBLE CATEGORICAL USE
OF FORCE BY THE L.A.P.D.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.794
AND, YOU KNOW,
RAY DID SAY

08:46.827 --> 08:48.796
THAT THIS WAS
HIS TOUGHEST BUST EVER.

08:48.829 --> 08:51.264
I THINK THAT I SHOULD GO
TO COUNTY JAIL

08:51.298 --> 08:54.001
AND INTERVIEW MR. DIAMOND
IMMEDIATELY.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.969
AND WHILE YOU'RE TAKING
HIS COMPLAINT,

08:56.003 --> 08:57.705
WOULD YOU PLEASE
LET HIM KNOW

08:57.738 --> 08:59.807
THAT I AM IN COMMUNICATION
WITH DDA HOBBS?

08:59.840 --> 09:01.274
GREAT.

09:01.308 --> 09:04.812
SEE IF YOU CAN GET HIM
TO CONFIRM THAT THIS BANKER,

09:04.845 --> 09:07.581
ROBERT CURTIS,
REALLY IS THE INTENDED TARGET.

09:07.615 --> 09:10.684
ALSO, IF, WHILE YOU'RE
CONDUCTING YOUR F.I.D.
INVESTIGATION,

09:10.718 --> 09:13.020
MR. DIAMOND HAS ANYTHING MORE
TO SAY ABOUT THIS KITE,

09:13.053 --> 09:15.155
I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.767
CHIEF?

09:26.800 --> 09:30.170
LOOKS LIKE RAY DIAMOND WON'T
BE FILING A COMPLAINT AFTER ALL.

09:34.742 --> 09:37.344
[ POLICE RADIO CHATTER,
CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING ]

09:37.377 --> 09:38.712
Man: WE'VE SECURED THE SCENE.
IT'S ALL YOURS.

09:38.746 --> 09:39.713
YOU GUYS CAN FEEL FREE
TO TAKE OVER.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.314
ANY QUESTIONS?

09:41.348 --> 09:43.250
SERGEANT...

09:43.283 --> 09:44.718
STANTON?

09:44.752 --> 09:46.219
SERGEANT STANTON,
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

09:46.253 --> 09:47.755
WHO MURDERED
RAY DIAMOND?

09:47.788 --> 09:49.322
THIS IS HIGH-POWER,
MA'AM.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.891
GOT ONLY ABOUT A DOZEN GUYS
TO CHOOSE FROM,

09:50.924 --> 09:52.025
AND ALL OF THEM LOVE
KILLING PEOPLE.

09:52.059 --> 09:54.127
SUCH A SECURE WING.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.329
HOW DID THEY MANAGE
TO STAB HIM TO DEATH

09:56.363 --> 09:57.931
WITHOUT A GUARD
NOTICING?

09:57.965 --> 09:59.667
ALL DUE RESPECT, MA'AM,

09:59.700 --> 10:01.669
THE COUNTY OWNS
THIS INVESTIGATION.

10:01.702 --> 10:02.836
WE DON'T ANSWER TO YOU.

10:02.870 --> 10:05.673
IN FACT,
WE HAVE OUR OWN QUESTIONS.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.775
LIKE WHY ALL THIS INTEREST
IN RAY TO BEGIN WITH?

10:07.808 --> 10:11.011
RAY MADE ALLEGATIONS OF POLICE
BRUTALITY DURING HIS ARREST.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.412
AND I CAN HELP YOU OUT
WITH THAT.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.148
BEFORE HE DIED, RAY SAID
THE COPS DIDN'T DO IT.

10:15.182 --> 10:17.384
REALLY?
WELL, GOOD LUCK.

10:17.417 --> 10:20.287
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING
THE GUY WAS STABBED IN THE
THROAT HALF A DOZEN TIMES.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.390
YEAH, HE HAD TO
REPEAT IT TWICE.

10:23.423 --> 10:26.059
LOOK...

10:26.093 --> 10:28.061
FIRST YOU GUYS SEND DOWN
A DEPUTY CHIEF,

10:28.095 --> 10:30.097
AND YOU FOLLOW UP
WITH A CAPTAIN?

10:30.130 --> 10:32.700
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
SOME BRUTALITY BEEF.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.201
IF THERE'S SOMETHING
WE NEED TO KNOW --

10:34.234 --> 10:37.204
TELL ME, SERGEANT,
OTHER THAN THE L.A.P.D.,

10:37.237 --> 10:40.708
DID RAY DIAMOND HAVE ANY
VISITORS IN THE PAST 48 HOURS?

10:46.914 --> 10:47.881
HEY.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.282
HEY, YOURSELF.

10:49.316 --> 10:52.452
I CAME BY THIS MORNING.
WHERE WERE YOU?

10:52.485 --> 10:54.755
I'M A BUSY MAN.
WHAT CAN I SAY?

10:54.788 --> 10:57.057
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR FACE?

10:57.090 --> 10:58.792
THIS?

10:58.826 --> 11:00.961
HIGH-SPEED CHASES
NEVER END GOOD, YOU KNOW?

11:00.994 --> 11:03.897
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN ONE.

11:05.332 --> 11:09.036
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?

11:09.069 --> 11:10.137
NOTHING.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.139
YOU'RE PRETTY.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.808
WELL, IT WAS GOOD TO SEE YOU.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.476
OH, SO, THAT'S IT?

11:16.509 --> 11:20.047
JUST DO IT?
DON'T SAY NOTHING.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.281
RIGHT ON.

11:22.816 --> 11:25.018
Raydor:
STOP RIGHT THERE.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.453
BUZZ, PLEASE
PLAY IT BACK AGAIN SLOWLY

11:26.486 --> 11:27.921
AND BLOW IT UP
IF YOU CAN.

11:27.955 --> 11:30.791
YOU REALLY WANT TO
WATCH IT AGAIN?

11:30.824 --> 11:33.160
BIGGER AND SLOWER.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.838
THERE'S YOUR KITE.

11:44.872 --> 11:48.942
EW. RAY DIAMOND PASSED IT
THROUGH A KISS.

11:48.976 --> 11:50.510
WHO IS THAT WOMAN?

11:50.543 --> 11:52.345
ACCORDING TO THE VISITORS' LOG,
HER NAME IS MARIA FLORES.

11:52.379 --> 11:55.282
AND UNDER "RELATION,"
SHE PUT DOWN "GIRLFRIEND."

11:55.315 --> 11:57.517
GIRLFRIEND?
SHE'S, LIKE, HALF HIS AGE.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.087
HEY, THE HEART WANTS
WHAT THE HEART WANTS.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.455
WELL, APPARENTLY,
MISS FLORES VISITS

12:02.489 --> 12:04.758
A VARIETY OF PRISONERS
AT THE MEN'S COUNTY JAIL,

12:04.792 --> 12:06.326
AND EACH TIME, SHE LISTS
HERSELF AS GIRLFRIEND.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.195
SO, IF RAY DIAMOND
WAS TELLING THE TRUTH,

12:08.228 --> 12:09.963
THAT KISS GOODBYE
CONTAINED THE ORDERS

12:09.997 --> 12:11.464
TO MURDER
THE CARTEL BANKER.

12:11.498 --> 12:12.800
WHICH MEANS
THE KILLER OR KILLERS

12:12.833 --> 12:14.367
MAY ALREADY
BE ON THE MOVE.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.203
I MEAN, THE HIT'S SUPPOSED TO
HAPPEN SOMETIME TODAY.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.371
I SENT TWO SERGEANTS
TO MISS FLORES' HOME,

12:18.405 --> 12:20.140
BUT SHE HASN'T BEEN SEEN
SINCE LAST NIGHT.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.842
EXCUSE ME, CHIEF.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.778
DDA HOBBS IS IN POPE'S OFFICE.
THEY ASKED FOR YOU.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.148
POPE'S TRYING TO HAND THIS
INVESTIGATION OVER TO COUNTY.

12:28.181 --> 12:31.051
BUT ON THE TAPE, CHIEF,
RAY DIAMOND TOLD MARIA FLORES

12:31.084 --> 12:32.319
THAT HE WAS INJURED

12:32.352 --> 12:35.088
AFTER A HIGH-SPEED CHASE
WITH THE POLICE.

12:35.122 --> 12:37.925
SO YOU STILL HAVE
AN OPEN USE

12:37.958 --> 12:40.093
AND CHIEF POPE
CANNOT SHUT ME DOWN.

12:40.127 --> 12:43.063
WELL, THEN MARIA FLORES MAY BE
AN EXCELLENT WITNESS FOR YOU.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.097
IF I CAN FIND HER.

12:48.035 --> 12:50.003
HELLO, EVERYONE.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.406
HEY, GAVIN.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.376
Brenda: OH, GAVIN,
UM, I'M SO SORRY.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.311
I FORGOT
YOU WERE COMING.

12:58.345 --> 13:01.915
WE'VE JUST BEEN HIT WITH
A POSSIBLE MURDER-FOR-HIRE CASE,

13:01.949 --> 13:03.884
AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO
HAVE TO RESCHEDULE.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.386
WELL, DEAR, WHAT'S THE POINT
IN CONFIRMING OUR APPOINTMENTS

13:06.419 --> 13:08.055
IF YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO KEEP THEM?

13:08.088 --> 13:09.923
I'VE NO CONTROL OVER
WHEN PEOPLE ARE KILLED,

13:09.957 --> 13:12.359
AND THIS CASE HAS
A TICKING CLOCK ON IT, SO...

13:12.392 --> 13:14.127
YOU WANT TO SEE
A TICKING CLOCK?

13:14.161 --> 13:17.497
THIS IS
MY SCHEDULE TODAY,

13:17.530 --> 13:20.400
AND THESE ARE THE HOURS
FOR WHICH YOU WILL BE BILLED.

13:20.433 --> 13:23.170
SOMEONE'S LIFE
IS IN THE BALANCE.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.305
WELL, I'M NOT PAID
TO CARE ABOUT THAT.

13:25.338 --> 13:27.507
I AM PAID TO CARE ABOUT YOU
BY THE HOUR.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.276
HEY, GAVIN.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.911
UM, CHIEF, COME ON.

13:30.944 --> 13:34.081
We know that information
is being leaked

13:34.114 --> 13:36.549
to the Baylor family's attorney
by somebody in your division,

13:36.583 --> 13:40.053
and Gavin needs to interview...
everyone here.

13:40.087 --> 13:42.555
But I haven't prepared
everybody for this.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.624
You haven't told
your detectives

13:44.657 --> 13:46.259
that Gavin needs
to talk to them?

13:46.293 --> 13:47.594
NO.

13:47.627 --> 13:50.230
Well, now may be
a very good time to do it.

13:50.263 --> 13:53.533
ALL RIGHT, UH, EVERYONE
LET ME HAVE YOUR ATTENTION

13:53.566 --> 13:55.235
JUST FOR A MOMENT,
PLEASE.

13:55.268 --> 13:58.338
I KNOW THAT EVERYONE'S
BEEN THROUGH THE WRINGER

13:58.371 --> 14:00.640
ON THIS WHOLE
SHOOTIN' NEWTON CASE,

14:00.673 --> 14:04.311
AND, UM, ALL OF YOU
SAW MY ATTORNEY, GAVIN,

14:04.344 --> 14:05.578
AT YOUR DEPOSITIONS.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.881
SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW HIM

14:07.915 --> 14:10.050
FROM HIS DAYS
AS A CITY ATTORNEY.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.919
OF COURSE I DO.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.955
GAVIN DEFENDED ME
IN MY FAVORITE CASE EVER.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.589
I WAS DRIVING MY CAR,

14:16.623 --> 14:18.658
AND I RAN OVER SOME DIRTBAG
WHO WAS SHOOTING AT ME.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.228
OKAY?
SO HIS PARENTS SUED ME.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.529
NOW,
AT THE END OF THE TRIAL,

14:22.562 --> 14:25.065
GAVIN TURNS TO THE JURY,
AND HE SAYS --

14:25.098 --> 14:27.434
TURNED TO THE JURY,
AND HE SAID,

14:27.467 --> 14:29.970
"WELL, THE LIEUTENANT
WAS BEING SHOT AT
THROUGH HIS WINDSHIELD.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.039
"WHAT'D YOU
WANT HIM TO DO?

14:32.072 --> 14:34.274
HONK IF HE
LOVED JESUS?"

14:37.377 --> 14:40.380
YEAH.
"HONK IF YOU LOVE JESUS."

14:40.413 --> 14:41.548
I WAS JUST
GONNA SAY THAT.

14:41.581 --> 14:44.351
YES, YES.
GOOD TIMES, INDEED.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.319
I TAKE IT GAVIN
WANTS TO TALK TO US.

14:46.353 --> 14:49.189
UH, TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT,
COMMANDER, YES.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.124
HAS THIS BEEN CLEARED
WITH OUR UNION REPS?

14:52.425 --> 14:54.327
WELL,
I'M NOT SWEARING ANYONE,

14:54.361 --> 14:56.396
AND IT'S COMPLETELY
CONFIDENTIAL.

14:56.429 --> 15:00.267
AND I JUST HAVE A SHORT LIST
HERE OF FIVE QUESTIONS.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.170
SEE? ONE PAGE.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.305
Taylor: GABRIEL,
THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.207
I'LL EVEN GO FIRST.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.309
CHIEF, YOU MIND IF WE USE
YOUR CONFERENCE ROOM?

15:09.342 --> 15:10.978
NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.
THANK YOU.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.053
Hobbs: I CAN'T WAIT
ANY LONGER.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.354
ROBERT CURTIS' ATTORNEY

15:21.388 --> 15:24.291
HAS BEEN SLOW-WALKING US
FOR THREE YEARS.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.593
IT'S ALREADY COST
THE TAXPAYERS MILLIONS.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.495
THE PRELIMINARY HEARING
IS SET FOR TODAY,

15:28.528 --> 15:30.363
AFTER THE JUDGE'S
REGULAR COURT HOURS.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.099
CURTIS WILL BE THERE.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.167
THE MURDER IS
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN TODAY.

15:34.201 --> 15:36.303
ACCORDING TO A JAILHOUSE SNITCH
AND CONVICTED PERJURER.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.105
WHO WAS KILLED
FOR SPEAKING TO US.

15:38.138 --> 15:41.441
PEOPLE GET KNOCKED OFF FOR ALL
KINDS OF REASONS IN COUNTY JAIL,

15:41.474 --> 15:44.144
AND THIS SO-CALLED THREAT CAN'T
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH CURTIS.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.546
HIS HEARING IS BEING HELD
IN A SECRET LOCATION.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.948
WHERE?

15:51.118 --> 15:55.088
IN A POLICE SUBSTATION
OFF OLVERA STREET,

15:55.122 --> 15:56.556
WHICH NOBODY --
ABSOLUTELY NOBODY --

15:56.589 --> 15:58.191
KNOWS ABOUT,
NOT EVEN THE JUDGE.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.760
MAYBE THE CARTEL HAS SOURCES
THE JUDGE DOESN'T.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.130
RIGHT. THE DEATH OF A POTENTIAL
INFORMANT IN THIS CASE

16:03.163 --> 16:04.998
WOULD SEEM TO SUGGEST
THAT A DELAY MIGHT BE PRUDENT.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.433
NO, NO, NO.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.035
THE TESTIMONY
OF ROBERT CURTIS

16:08.068 --> 16:10.170
WILL HELP DEFUND
A NARCO-TERROR ORGANIZATION

16:10.203 --> 16:13.173
THAT HAS BEEN OPERATING
WITH IMPUNITY ACROSS OUR BORDER!

16:13.206 --> 16:15.708
I WON'T RISK GETTING HIM SCARED
INTO BACKING OFF.

16:15.742 --> 16:18.345
WHAT IF CURTIS GETS ASSASSINATED
ON HIS WAY TO COURT?

16:18.378 --> 16:20.413
WE HAVE AN ENORMOUS SECURITY
TEAM AROUND HIM ALREADY.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.182
DO YOU WANT ME
TO MAKE IT BIGGER?

16:22.215 --> 16:24.317
BY AT LEAST ONE. I WANT TO JOIN
THE SECURITY DETAIL.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.386
BRENDA. BRENDA.
NO, NO. I DON'T
WANT YOU INVOLVED.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.388
LOOK, THE LAST TIME I FAILED
TO PREVENT A MURDER,

16:28.421 --> 16:30.523
WE GOT SUED --
ALL OF US.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.392
YOU REALLY WANT TO
GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN?

16:38.465 --> 16:41.034
FINE. YOU CAN SPEAK
WITH ROBERT CURTIS,

16:41.068 --> 16:43.570
BUT YOU WILL NOT MENTION
A SPECIFIC THREAT TO HIM.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.738
HE GOES TO COURT TODAY.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.274
GREAT, AND I'LL SEND
YOUR BOSS THE BILL

16:47.307 --> 16:49.076
FOR CHIEF JOHNSON'S
SERVICES.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.377
I'M COMING, TOO.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.112
FRITZI, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

16:52.145 --> 16:54.347
YOU CAN'T BOTH JUST INVITE
YOURSELVES INTO MY CASE.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.649
HEY, THE FBI HAS BEEN WORKING
THIS INVESTIGATION, TOO, HOBBS.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.785
IF THE CARTEL
WANTS TO GET TO CURTIS,

16:58.818 --> 17:01.421
HIS SECURITY DETAIL IS
THE PERFECT PLACE TO START.

17:01.454 --> 17:04.124
AND YOU ARE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE BULLETS COULD
BE FIRED WITHOUT ME.

17:04.157 --> 17:07.160
OH, GOD.
BOTH OF YOU, REALLY?

17:07.194 --> 17:08.361
WE'LL BLEND IN
PERFECTLY.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.604
REGARDING TURELL BAYLOR,

17:17.637 --> 17:20.173
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT A FEW
HOURS BEFORE HE WAS KILLED,

17:20.207 --> 17:22.675
MR. BAYLOR CONFESSED
TO THE SHOOTIN' NEWTON MURDERS.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.745
YEAH, BUT HE HAD
AN IMMUNITY DEAL,
SO WE HAD TO CUT HIM LOOSE.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.480
IT'S ALL
IN THE DEPOSITION.

17:27.514 --> 17:30.383
AND YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO ADD TO THAT?

17:33.186 --> 17:35.688
GOOD.
WE'RE ALREADY 20% DONE.

17:35.722 --> 17:40.460
SO, WHEN CHIEF JOHNSON AND
DETECTIVES GABRIEL AND SANCHEZ

17:40.493 --> 17:42.829
RETURNED FROM DROPPING
MR. BAYLOR OFF AT HIS HOUSE,

17:42.862 --> 17:44.697
WHAT DID THEY SAY?

17:44.731 --> 17:47.200
I DON'T KNOW.
NOTHING, REALLY.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.636
YOU KNOW, I GUESS
DETECTIVE GABRIEL

17:49.669 --> 17:52.872
MAY HAVE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT IT BEING A LOUSY DAY.

17:52.905 --> 17:57.210
AND CAN YOU ELABORATE ON WHAT
WAS MEANT BY "A LOUSY DAY"?

17:57.244 --> 17:59.746
"LOUSY"
AS IN "NOT GOOD,"

17:59.779 --> 18:03.383
"DAY" AS IN IT STARTED OFF
INVESTIGATING A TRIPLE HOMICIDE

18:03.416 --> 18:05.652
OF U.S. SERVICEMEN
AT 1:30 A.M.

18:05.685 --> 18:08.688
AND ENDED WITH LETTING OFF A
DOUBLE MURDERER 18 HOURS LATER.

18:08.721 --> 18:11.891
SO, YES, IT WAS A LONG,
EXHAUSTING, CRAPPY,

18:11.924 --> 18:14.227
LOUSY,
AS IN "NOT GOOD," DAY.

18:15.462 --> 18:16.896
NEXT QUESTION.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.732
Curtis:
WHO ARE YOU?

18:19.766 --> 18:21.734
PART OF
MY SECURITY DETAIL?

18:21.768 --> 18:24.204
YES, WE ARE, SIR.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.805
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE NEVER MET BEFORE.

18:25.838 --> 18:27.807
MUST BE NEW.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.242
ROB.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.879
I'M...
BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON,

18:32.912 --> 18:35.282
AND, UM,
THIS IS FRITZ.

18:35.315 --> 18:38.618
REALLY, REALLY NICE
TO MEET YOU.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.887
YOU TOO, Y-YOU TOO.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.557
I'M GONNA GO
CHECK THE STREET.

18:50.363 --> 18:54.634
ANDREA, WHO IS THAT GUY?
I DON'T LIKE HIM.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.336
WE'LL KEEP HIM AWAY.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.738
YEAH,
BUT YOU...STAY CLOSE.

18:58.771 --> 19:03.276
OH, DON'T GO
TOO CLOSE TO THE DOOR.

19:04.677 --> 19:08.248
YOU'VE GOT PRETTY GOOD EYES,
AS WELL AS A FIRM GRIP.

19:08.281 --> 19:12.519
SO, TELL ME,
BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON,

19:12.552 --> 19:13.753
DO I LOOK CROOKED
TO YOU?

19:13.786 --> 19:15.822
SIR?

19:15.855 --> 19:17.724
MY TIE --
DOES IT LOOK CROOKED?

19:17.757 --> 19:19.326
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE
THE WRONG IMPRESSION

19:19.359 --> 19:21.194
ON MY BIG DAY IN COURT.

19:21.228 --> 19:24.431
NO, NO, NO, YOU, UH --
YOU LOOK LIKE A BILLION BUCKS.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.234
AND FROM WHAT
I UNDERSTAND,

19:27.267 --> 19:29.202
THAT'S CHICKEN FEED
TO THE CARTEL.

19:29.236 --> 19:33.506
THE GARCIAS RUN A LARGE
BUSINESS. THAT'S TRUE.

19:33.540 --> 19:36.709
A BUSINESS? IS, UH,
THAT WHAT YOU CALL IT?

19:36.743 --> 19:39.579
IT'S A MARKET-DRIVEN RESPONSE
THAT OPERATES ENTIRELY

19:39.612 --> 19:41.614
ON THE PRINCIPLE
OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.950
PEOPLE WANT DRUGS.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.985
THE CARTEL
DISTRIBUTES THEM.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.755
SO, YES,
IT'S A BUSINESS.

19:48.788 --> 19:51.958
EXCEPT THE CARTEL
KILLS PEOPLE.

19:51.991 --> 19:55.295
TELL ME, HOW MANY AMERICAN LIVES
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED

19:55.328 --> 19:57.464
BY WALL STREET TRADERS
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS?

19:57.497 --> 20:01.534
HMM? HOW MANY HOMES LOST,
PENSIONS WIPED OUT?

20:01.568 --> 20:03.570
HOW MANY
RELATED SUICIDES?

20:03.603 --> 20:06.839
WHO GETS ARRESTED WHEN
AN OIL RIG BLOWS UP IN THE GULF?

20:06.873 --> 20:10.310
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THOSE GUYS AND THE CARTEL

20:10.343 --> 20:12.645
IS THAT THE GARCIAS
KNOW THEIR VICTIMS BY NAME.

20:12.679 --> 20:15.882
NOW YOU'RE TESTIFYING
AGAINST THEM?

20:15.915 --> 20:19.319
WELL, I WAS CAUGHT,
WASN'T I?

20:19.352 --> 20:22.689
BUT YOU
GET TO WALK AWAY.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.724
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS,
SWEETHEART.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.726
THE BANKER
ALWAYS WALKS AWAY.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.028
MR. CURTIS,
PLEASE GATHER YOUR THINGS.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.797
YOUR ATTORNEY'S ARRIVED,
AND WE'LL BE HEADING OUT.

20:30.830 --> 20:31.964
GOTCHA, BOSS.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.503
UM, JUST ONE SECOND.
I JUST...

20:36.536 --> 20:38.405
OH. THANK YOU.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.039
OH, MY PLEASURE.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.641
I -- I WAS JUST
WONDERING.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.843
IN ALL YOUR DEALINGS
WITH THE CARTEL,

20:43.876 --> 20:46.779
DID YOU EVER COME ACROSS A WOMAN
NAMED MARIA FLORES?

20:46.813 --> 20:48.981
OH, YEAH,
THE KISS OF DEATH.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.717
IT'S A LITTLE JOKE.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.553
UH, MARIA --
SHE HAS AN ODD HABIT.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.822
EVERY TIME SHE VISITS A GUY
IN JAIL, THE NEXT DAY,

20:55.855 --> 20:57.757
SOMEBODY ON THE OUTSIDE
TURNS UP DEAD.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.759
SHE'S ON
THE GARCIAS' PAYROLL.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.060
LOW-LEVEL.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.995
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHO ARE YOU?

21:03.029 --> 21:05.365
WHO IS SHE?
NICK, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS BRENDA.

21:05.398 --> 21:06.733
SHE'S ONE
OF THE GOOD GUYS.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.568
THAT'S NOT
FOR YOU TO DECIDE.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.337
RELAX.
I DIDN'T SAY A THING.
NICK, WHAT'S WRONG?

21:10.370 --> 21:12.739
MY CLIENT CANNOT BE QUESTIONED
WITHOUT ME BEING PRESENT.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.374
WHAT KIND OF GAME ARE YOU
PLAYING HERE, ANDREA?

21:14.407 --> 21:15.542
NO GAME.

21:15.575 --> 21:17.009
I WAS A DEPUTY D.A.
FOR 15 YEARS.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.311
I KNOW
ALL YOUR TRICKS.

21:18.345 --> 21:20.313
WHO ARE YOU?
WHO DO YOU WORK FOR?

21:20.347 --> 21:21.548
I WORK FOR THE L.A.P.D.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.450
I'M JUST HERE
TO PROTECT YOUR CLIENT.

21:23.483 --> 21:24.684
HMM.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.052
NICK, NOBODY'S GOING
AROUND YOUR BACK.

21:26.085 --> 21:28.321
DON'T USE THIS
AS ANOTHER EXCUSE TO DELAY.

21:28.355 --> 21:30.890
PARDON ME, GENTLEMEN.

21:30.923 --> 21:33.059
NICK, HEY,
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

21:33.092 --> 21:36.996
WHAT?
I WANT YOU TO SHUT UP.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

21:37.029 --> 21:38.898
YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.933
AND I'M REALLY GETTING
TIRED OF YOUR MOUTH.
ALL RIGHT.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.536
HELLO?

21:43.570 --> 21:45.505
I'VE FOUND MARIA FLORES.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.006
OH, THANK GOODNESS.
WHERE?

21:47.039 --> 21:49.642
IS THERE ANY REASON SHE'D BE
ON OLVERA STREET?

21:49.676 --> 21:51.678
DID YOU SAY
OLVERA STREET?

21:51.711 --> 21:53.413
Correct.

21:53.446 --> 21:54.814
I CAUGHT UP WITH HER
COMING OUT OF HER WORKPLACE,

21:54.847 --> 21:56.549
AND I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING HER
AROUND THE PLAZA HERE

21:56.583 --> 21:59.986
FOR THE LAST 20 MINUTES
IN SOME KIND OF HOLDING PATTERN.

22:00.019 --> 22:02.489
I THINK MARIA KNOWS THE LOCATION
OF THE SECRET COURT.

22:02.522 --> 22:03.856
UM, IS SHE ALONE?

22:03.890 --> 22:06.593
YEAH, ALTHOUGH
SHE COULD BE CIRCLING

22:06.626 --> 22:08.361
IN ORDER
TO PICK SOMEONE UP.

22:08.395 --> 22:10.530
OKAY, WE NEED TO FIND OUT
WHERE MARIA LEADS YOU.

22:10.563 --> 22:12.465
I'M GONNA SEND
MY DETECTIVES TO HELP.

22:12.499 --> 22:14.367
Don't pick her up
unless you absolutely have to,

22:14.401 --> 22:16.035
AND DO NOT LOSE HER.

22:16.068 --> 22:17.570
WHY WOULD I LOSE HER?

22:21.574 --> 22:24.143
MR. CURTIS CANNOT GO TO COURT
TODAY. IT'S NOT SAFE.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.546
THE LOCATION OF THE HEARING
HAS BEEN COMPROMISED.

22:26.579 --> 22:28.415
How do you know
that it's been compromised?

22:28.448 --> 22:30.116
BECAUSE MARIA FLORES
IS DRIVING AROUND

22:30.149 --> 22:31.718
LOOKING LIKE SHE'S WAITING
TO PICK SOMEONE UP.

22:31.751 --> 22:34.554
Damn it!
WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:36.155 --> 22:37.790
A CHANGE OF PLANS.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.826
CURTIS ISN'T GOING TO
TESTIFY TODAY.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.394
FINE.
I'LL ASK FOR A CONTINUANCE.

22:41.428 --> 22:43.663
NO. YOU'LL REPRESENT HIM
AT THE HEARING.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.565
THE JUDGE
JUST NEEDS TO KNOW

22:45.598 --> 22:47.700
THAT CURTIS HAS AGREED TO A DEAL
WITH THE D.A.'s OFFICE.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.736
YOU DON'T THINK HIS HONOR
WILL WANT TO HEAR FROM
MY CLIENT HIMSELF?

22:49.769 --> 22:52.071
YOU CAN GIVE THE JUDGE
THE BROAD STROKES.

22:52.104 --> 22:54.607
WE'LL SEE.

22:55.808 --> 22:59.446
YOU BETTER KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.882
NO. NO, NO, NO.
YOU STAY HERE.

23:02.915 --> 23:06.152
I LIKE THE THOUGHT OF YOU
BEING SURROUNDED BY A
PROTECTION DETAIL.

23:06.185 --> 23:09.489
BESIDES,
CURTIS WOULD MISS YOU.

23:09.522 --> 23:10.757
OH.

23:14.794 --> 23:16.596
Tao: THERE'S NOTHING
TO SAY, REALLY.

23:16.629 --> 23:17.997
I HAVE NOT
DISCUSSED THE CASE

23:18.030 --> 23:19.732
WITH ANYONE
OUTSIDE MAJOR CRIMES.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.434
THAT'S THE ANSWER
TO NUMBER THREE.

23:21.468 --> 23:24.571
UH, NUMBER FOUR,
YES, I WAS AWARE

23:24.604 --> 23:26.539
THAT TURRELL'S FAMILY
WAS UNDER FBI PROTECTION.

23:26.573 --> 23:29.108
AND, NUMBER FIVE, NO,
I AM NOT ON THE TEAM

23:29.141 --> 23:30.843
INVESTIGATING
TURRELL'S MURDER.

23:30.877 --> 23:34.213
UM, I HEAR THEY DON'T
EVEN HAVE A SUSPECT YET.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.948
GOOD.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.452
AND YOU'RE SURE THAT NO ONE
WHO WAS IN THE CAR WITH TURRELL

23:39.486 --> 23:41.187
AT THE TIME HE WAS DROPPED OFF
AT HIS HOUSE

23:41.220 --> 23:42.722
EVER SPOKE TO YOU?

23:42.755 --> 23:44.624
LOOK, THE ONLY THING
I CAN TELL YOU

23:44.657 --> 23:46.526
IS WHAT I TOLD
THE BAYLORS' LAWYER,

23:46.559 --> 23:48.861
WHICH IS THE SAME THING I TOLD
THE CITY ATTORNEY.

23:48.895 --> 23:50.129
AND THAT IS?

23:50.162 --> 23:52.799
MY NAME IS
DETECTIVE JULIO SANCHEZ,

23:52.832 --> 23:56.002
MAJOR CRIMES,
BADGE NUMBER 58323.

23:56.035 --> 23:58.805
IS THIS HOW YOU INTEND
TO ANSWER ALL OF MY QUESTIONS?

23:58.838 --> 24:00.707
I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS
OF MY OWN.

24:02.008 --> 24:05.011
OKAY. WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE TO KNOW?

24:05.044 --> 24:07.113
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?

24:07.146 --> 24:09.816
SAY A COP COMES ACROSS
A PILE OF CASH

24:09.849 --> 24:14.153
JUST LYING IN THE STREET --
SMALL BILLS, NONSEQUENTIAL.

24:14.186 --> 24:16.723
HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING,
IS HE OBLIGATED

24:16.756 --> 24:19.492
TO LOOK FOR THE PERSON WHO THAT
CASH ORIGINALLY BELONGED TO?

24:20.960 --> 24:22.795
FLYNN, RAYDOR FOUND
MARIA FLORES.

24:22.829 --> 24:23.930
THE CHIEF WANTS US
TO BACK HER UP.

24:27.099 --> 24:28.735
GOOD TALKING TO YOU,
COUNSELOR.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.903
ALWAYS AN EXPERIENCE,
LIEUTENANT.

24:30.937 --> 24:33.506
GAVIN, PUNCH OUT.
GRAB A COFFEE.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.575
WE GOT A PROBLEM.

24:40.046 --> 24:42.114
LORD, HAVE MERCY.

24:42.148 --> 24:46.919
WELL, THAT WAS FRUSTRATING,
NOT TO MENTION EMBARRASSING.

24:46.953 --> 24:49.155
I JUMPED THROUGH HOOPS
TO GET THE JUDGE DOWN HERE,

24:49.188 --> 24:50.990
JUST SO RHODES COULD GET
ANOTHER CONTINUANCE.

24:51.023 --> 24:52.925
I DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH LONGER

24:52.959 --> 24:54.794
I CAN KEEP ROBERT CURTIS
ON MY SIDE.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.997
YOU'RE ALREADY RELOCATING HIM.
HE'S NOT GOING TO JAIL.

24:58.030 --> 25:00.199
REALISTICALLY,
WHAT MORE CAN YOU GIVE HIM?

25:00.232 --> 25:01.267
MONEY.

25:01.300 --> 25:02.869
CURTIS IS THE ONLY ONE

25:02.902 --> 25:04.704
WHO KNOWS WHERE THE GARCIAS
PUT ALL THEIR CASH?

25:04.737 --> 25:06.072
EXACTLY.

25:06.105 --> 25:07.607
WHICH MAKES IT
EVEN MORE RIDICULOUS TO ME

25:07.640 --> 25:08.908
THAT THEY WOULD
TRY AND KILL HIM.

25:17.049 --> 25:19.552
[ TELEVISION PLAYING
INDISTINCTLY ]

25:19.586 --> 25:21.020
HELLO?

25:21.053 --> 25:22.922
CHIEF, MARIA FLORES
JUST PICKED UP A PASSENGER --

25:22.955 --> 25:25.091
YOUNG LATINO MALE --
WE'RE GONNA ROLL THEM UP.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.158
GOOD.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.694
WHATEVER DEAL YOU MAKE,

25:27.727 --> 25:29.128
THE FBI WILL PROBABLY END UP
WITH THE MONEY.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.830
I DON'T CARE
WHO HAS THE CASH,

25:30.863 --> 25:32.565
AS LONG AS
IT ISN'T THE CARTEL.

25:32.599 --> 25:34.801
WHERE ARE YOU?
HANG ON.
SHE'S TURNING.

25:34.834 --> 25:38.004
NOW I HAVE TO SET UP
ANOTHER SEQUESTERED HEARING.

25:38.037 --> 25:40.873
AND HOW DO WE KNOW THEY WON'T
FIGURE OUT WHERE THAT IS, TOO?

25:43.610 --> 25:45.612
IF THIS WAS EVER
AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

25:45.645 --> 25:47.914
TO BEGIN WITH,
WHICH I DOUBT VERY MUCH.

25:47.947 --> 25:50.316
OH, LET ME CALL MY OFFICE.
WHAT TIME IS IT?

25:58.625 --> 25:59.926
STAY ON 'EM!
STAY ON 'EM!

26:01.027 --> 26:02.261
CAPTAIN,
WHAT HAPPENED?!

26:02.294 --> 26:04.631
Where's Fritzi?!

26:04.664 --> 26:06.232
EVERYONE ALL RIGHT?

26:17.043 --> 26:18.377
OKAY,
PARAMEDICS ARE COMING.

26:18.410 --> 26:21.614
I'M NOT HIT.
I'M NOT HIT.
YOU ARE. YOU ARE.

26:21.648 --> 26:23.149
OH, MY GOD.

26:36.395 --> 26:38.097
Flynn:
CAREFUL, JULIO.

26:41.133 --> 26:43.035
GO LEFT!
LEFT! LEFT! LEFT! LEFT!

26:54.681 --> 26:55.915
AAH!

26:55.948 --> 26:57.083
WHOA!

27:05.457 --> 27:07.960
OUT OF THE CAR NOW!
OUT OF THE CAR!

27:07.994 --> 27:09.962
OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD!

27:09.996 --> 27:11.163
Flynn: OKAY, HANDS WHERE
WE CAN SEE 'EM!
DON'T SHOOT! DON'T SHOOT!

27:11.197 --> 27:12.665
HANDS WHERE
WE CAN SEE 'EM NOW!

27:13.265 --> 27:15.367
TOSS YOUR WEAPON NOW!
DO IT NOW!

27:15.401 --> 27:16.903
TOSS YOUR WEAPON
OUT OF THE CAR

27:16.936 --> 27:18.705
AND GET OUT WITH YOUR HANDS
IN THE AIR!

27:20.873 --> 27:23.075
YOU, UP AGAINST THE BUILDING
RIGHT NOW! RIGHT NOW!

27:24.410 --> 27:25.778
ON THE GROUND!

27:25.812 --> 27:28.180
iAL PISO!

27:28.214 --> 27:30.116
ON YOUR KNEES!

27:32.952 --> 27:34.821
DOWN ON YOUR KNEES!
STOP!

27:34.854 --> 27:36.322
STOP MOVING!

27:36.355 --> 27:38.357
CLEAR OUT OF THE WAY!
MOVE!

27:40.026 --> 27:41.928
STOP MOVING, SIR!

27:42.962 --> 27:44.864
CLEAR OUT OF THE WAY!
GET OUT OF THE WAY!

27:44.897 --> 27:47.466
NOBODY SHOOT.
I'VE GOT HIM.

27:47.499 --> 27:50.737
FREEZE WHERE YOU ARE --
NOW!

27:51.938 --> 27:54.006
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, LADY?
SHOOT ME?

27:54.040 --> 27:56.442
AH!

28:05.084 --> 28:08.354
Tao: HOLY CRAP! YOU GOT HIM
RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES.

28:08.387 --> 28:09.956
Raydor: LUCKY SHOT.

28:09.989 --> 28:12.759
THE RECOIL ON THESE
BEAN-BAG GUNS IS AWFUL.

28:28.875 --> 28:31.043
OH, FRITZI.
HEY.

28:31.077 --> 28:34.046
I'M FINE.
I'M FINE.

28:38.918 --> 28:40.820
GOOD JOB, EVERYONE.

28:40.853 --> 28:42.288
ANDREA?
I'M OKAY.

28:42.321 --> 28:43.522
JUST A SCRATCH.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.025
CHIEF, ROBERT CURTIS
AND HIS ATTORNEY

28:46.058 --> 28:48.394
ARE IN INTERVIEW ROOM 2,
AND THEY ARE NOT HAPPY.

28:48.427 --> 28:49.896
JOIN THE CLUB.

28:49.929 --> 28:51.197
Fritz:
MARIA FLORES INVOKED,

28:51.230 --> 28:52.431
BUT WE TOOK HER
INTO FEDERAL CUSTODY.

28:52.464 --> 28:53.933
Tao:
WE DON'T NEED HER.

28:53.966 --> 28:55.334
WE FOUND ALL THE INFO
ON THE SECRET COURT

28:55.367 --> 28:56.903
DOWN TO THE ROOM NUMBER

28:56.936 --> 29:01.440
AND PICTURES OF DDA HOBBS
IN THE TRUNK OF HER CAR.

29:01.473 --> 29:03.509
PLUS $15,000 IN CASH,

29:03.542 --> 29:06.045
WHICH I'M GUESSING WAS
THE DOWN PAYMENT ON KILLING YOU.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.947
GOOD TO KNOW
WHAT I'M WORTH.

29:07.980 --> 29:09.348
WHERE'S THE SHOOTER?

29:09.381 --> 29:10.950
IN THE HOSPITAL, UNCONSCIOUS.
HE'LL LIVE, CHIEF.

29:10.983 --> 29:12.418
CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING.

29:12.451 --> 29:15.187
WE I.D.'d HIM AS HECTOR MEDINA,
MEXICAN NATIONAL.

29:15.221 --> 29:18.124
PROBABLY SENT OVER THE BORDER
JUST FOR THIS JOB, CHIEF.

29:18.157 --> 29:20.526
THAT EXPLAINS WHY MARIA
WAS DRIVING HIM AROUND.

29:20.559 --> 29:22.161
HE DIDN'T KNOW
THE AREA.

29:22.194 --> 29:24.063
OR HAVE
A DRIVER'S LICENSE.
CHIEF.

29:25.064 --> 29:27.566
VISITORS LOGS FROM COUNTY
GOING BACK TWO WEEKS.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.768
OH, WONDERFUL.

29:35.241 --> 29:37.043
THANK YOU.
MM.

29:37.076 --> 29:39.478
OH,
AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED,

29:39.511 --> 29:41.948
RAY DIAMOND
WAS NOT BEATEN UP

29:41.981 --> 29:43.482
BY THE OFFICERS
WHO APPREHENDED HIM.

29:43.515 --> 29:46.118
I FOUND A WITNESS IN JAIL
WHO SAYS THAT MR. DIAMOND

29:46.152 --> 29:51.323
ADMITTED THAT HE RAN INTO
A TELEPHONE POLE FACE-FIRST.

29:51.357 --> 29:54.026
YOU STILL WORKING DIAMOND'S
USE

29:54.060 --> 29:55.427
OF COURSE.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.429
WHAT'D YOU THINK
I WAS DOING?

29:58.898 --> 30:01.333
I'LL BE BACK
BEFORE GAVIN LEAVES.

30:03.602 --> 30:06.238
WHY WOULD THE CARTEL
WANT TO KILL ME?

30:07.606 --> 30:09.275
I'M REPLACEABLE.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.979
I THINK YOU JUST ANSWERED
YOUR OWN QUESTION.

30:19.986 --> 30:23.089
THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN.

30:25.024 --> 30:27.226
BRENDA.
IS ANDREA OKAY?

30:27.259 --> 30:29.962
YES, YES. SHE'S FINE.
THANKS FOR ASKING.

30:29.996 --> 30:31.898
THOSE SONS OF BITCHES.
THAT COULD'VE BEEN ME.

30:31.931 --> 30:35.567
WELL, REMEMBER, MR. CURTIS.
IT'S JUST BUSINESS.

30:35.601 --> 30:39.105
Rhodes:
CHIEF JOHNSON, WE WILL NOT
BE TAKING QUESTIONS ANYMORE

30:39.138 --> 30:41.407
FROM THE L.A.P.D.
OR DDA HOBBS.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.342
WITH THIS BRAZEN ACT
OF VIOLENCE,

30:43.375 --> 30:45.077
WE NOW FEEL THE STATE
CAN NO LONGER

30:45.111 --> 30:48.080
ADEQUATELY PROTECT MR. CURTIS
FROM THE CARTEL.

30:48.114 --> 30:49.481
IS THAT TRUE, ROB?

30:49.515 --> 30:51.483
UNTIL YOU GUYS WORK
THIS THING OUT, YEAH.

30:51.517 --> 30:55.121
I --
I DON'T FEEL SAFE.

30:55.154 --> 30:57.656
BUT YOU WEREN'T THE TARGET
OF THIS ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.291
IT WAS DDA HOBBS.

30:59.325 --> 31:01.493
ANDREA HOBBS?
COME ON.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.462
THEY MAY BE
SERIOUSLY PSYCHOTIC...

31:03.495 --> 31:06.933
YOU'RE STILL OFF THE CLOCK.
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT?

31:06.966 --> 31:09.368
NOW, SUGGESTING THAT THEY WOULD
DELIBERATELY TRY ANYTHING

31:09.401 --> 31:11.670
AGAINST A DDA
IS COMPLETELY UNBELIEVABLE.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.605
THEY MAY SHOOT A COP
NOW AND AGAIN,

31:13.639 --> 31:15.541
BUT NEVER A PROSECUTOR
OR A JUDGE.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.276
YOU'RE A LITTLE BEHIND,
MR. RHODES.

31:17.309 --> 31:18.577
WE ALREADY CAUGHT
THE SHOOTER.

31:18.610 --> 31:21.113
I'M MORE INTERESTED
IN MARIA FLORES --

31:21.147 --> 31:24.583
THE WOMAN THAT YOUR CLIENT HERE
CALLED "THE KISS OF DEATH."

31:24.616 --> 31:28.020
SHE WAS DRIVING AROUND
THE WOULD-BE ASSASSIN.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.655
AND THAT GOT ME
TO THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING

31:29.688 --> 31:32.358
THAT YOU TOLD ME
EARLIER TODAY, ROB.

31:32.391 --> 31:33.960
SOMETHING I TOLD YOU?
ABOUT MARIA?

31:33.993 --> 31:35.661
YOU SAID THAT SHE WAS
ON THE CARTEL'S PAYROLL.

31:35.694 --> 31:37.563
AND FROM WHAT
I UNDERSTAND,

31:37.596 --> 31:39.331
YOU HANDLE
ALL THE GARCIAS' MONEY.

31:39.365 --> 31:40.933
WAIT, YOU CAN'T THINK
THAT I PAID MARIA

31:40.967 --> 31:42.401
TO HIRE A HITMAN
TO KILL ANDREA.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.303
SHUT UP, ROBERT.

31:44.336 --> 31:45.704
HEY, DO NOT TELL ME
TO SHUT UP AGAIN!
JUST LET ME, PLEASE.

31:45.737 --> 31:48.340
LOOK, MY CLIENT IS
A GOVERNMENT WITNESS.

31:48.374 --> 31:50.009
IT'S HIS ASS
ON THE LINE HERE.
YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
BETTER FOR ME THAN ANDREA.

31:50.042 --> 31:53.412
YOUR ATTORNEY IS RIGHT, ROB.
YOU ARE IN DANGER.

31:53.445 --> 31:55.014
WHICH IS WHY YOUR TRIAL
WAS SECURED

31:55.047 --> 31:56.282
DOWN
TO THE SMALLEST DETAIL.

31:56.315 --> 31:58.951
AND YET MARIA FLORES
KNEW ALL ABOUT IT.

31:58.985 --> 32:00.186
WELL, I DIDN'T TELL HER
WHERE IT WAS.

32:00.219 --> 32:01.487
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
MYSELF.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.155
SURE YOU DID.
YOUR ATTORNEY HERE TOLD YOU.

32:03.189 --> 32:04.690
OH, WHOA, WHOA. WAIT.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.325
I NEVER TOLD CURTIS
THE ADDRESS.

32:06.358 --> 32:08.294
MR. RHODES, YOU ARE
A SWORN OFFICER OF THE COURT.

32:08.327 --> 32:10.562
ARE YOU TELLING ME
WITHOUT QUALIFICATION

32:10.596 --> 32:12.031
THAT YOU DID NOT REVEAL
TO YOUR CLIENT

32:12.064 --> 32:13.299
THE ADDRESS
OF THE SECRET COURTHOUSE?

32:13.332 --> 32:16.202
WE NEVER DISCUSSED IT.
I SWEAR.

32:16.235 --> 32:18.204
THEN HOW DID
THE CARTEL'S TOP LEADERS --

32:18.237 --> 32:20.072
WHO ARE ALL IN COUNTY
RIGHT NOW --

32:20.106 --> 32:22.474
KNOW THE ADDRESS AND WHERE
TO WAIT FOR DDA HOBBS?

32:22.508 --> 32:26.112
I DON'T KNOW, BUT THIS IS JUST
THE KIND OF LAPSE IN SECURITY

32:26.145 --> 32:28.480
THAT I'VE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT
SINCE THIS WHOLE TRIAL BEGAN.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.255
TWO WEEKS AGO,
THE CARTEL'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

32:36.288 --> 32:40.092
HAD A BOARD MEETING...
IN COUNTY LOCK-UP.

32:40.126 --> 32:43.695
AND, UH, ACCORDING
TO THE VISITORS LOG,

32:43.729 --> 32:46.732
MR. RHODES,
YOU WERE THERE.

32:46.765 --> 32:49.435
AND UNDER
"RELATIONSHIP TO PRISONER,"

32:49.468 --> 32:51.370
YOU WROTE...

32:51.403 --> 32:53.605
"COUNSEL."

32:53.639 --> 32:56.108
"COUNSEL"?

32:56.142 --> 32:58.510
WHAT THE HELL?
NICK?
LOOK, NO, NO, NO.

32:58.544 --> 33:01.247
SEE, THIS IS JUST WHAT SHE'S
TRYING TO DO, ROBERT,
IS MAKE YOU TALK.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.781
NOW, I'M LEAVING. YOU CAN'T
TALK TO MY CLIENT ANYMORE.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.283
IF I WERE YOU, I WOULDN'T AGREE
TO STOP TALKING TO ME.

33:04.316 --> 33:05.651
GAME OVER!
YOUR LIFE
DEPENDS ON IT.

33:05.684 --> 33:07.453
YOUR ATTORNEY WAS SITTING
WITH THE CARTEL'S

33:07.486 --> 33:09.288
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
FOR ALMOST AN HOUR.

33:09.321 --> 33:12.291
NICK, WAIT.
WAIT! WAIT!

33:12.324 --> 33:15.061
WHY WERE YOU
AT THE JAIL, NICK?

33:18.764 --> 33:20.466
LOOK...

33:20.499 --> 33:22.734
THE GARCIAS ARE REPRESENTING
THEMSELVES IN THIS TRIAL.

33:22.768 --> 33:25.771
AS THE COUNSEL
FOR A SEPARATED CO-DEFENDANT --

33:25.804 --> 33:28.207
YOU -- I'M ENTITLED
TO ASK ABOUT THEIR DEFENSE.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.708
AND YOU JUST SO HAPPENED
TO TELL THEM...
OH, MY GOD.

33:29.741 --> 33:31.343
...THAT AFTER YEARS OF STALLING,
YOU COULD NO LONGER

33:31.377 --> 33:33.112
KEEP MR. CURTIS HERE FROM MAKING
A DEAL WITH THE D.A.?

33:33.145 --> 33:34.680
OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE WORKING FOR THEM.
NOT TRUE!

33:34.713 --> 33:36.548
BUT THE CARTEL COULDN'T
KILL YOU, MR. CURTIS,

33:36.582 --> 33:38.150
WITHOUT LOSING ACCESS
TO THEIR MONEY.

33:38.184 --> 33:40.719
SO THEY DECIDED TO KILL
DDA HOBBS INSTEAD.

33:40.752 --> 33:42.688
THAT IS CLEARLY INSANE.
LET'S FACE IT.

33:42.721 --> 33:44.690
YOUR LAWYER IS TRYING
TO PUT YOU IN JAIL,

33:44.723 --> 33:46.125
WHERE THE GARCIAS CAN DO
WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOU.

33:46.158 --> 33:47.693
SHE'S LYING, ROBERT.
I'M NOT LYING.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.628
SHE'S LYING.
I'M NOT LYING.
I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU.

33:49.661 --> 33:51.230
NICK RHODES, YOU HAVE
THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.

33:51.263 --> 33:53.099
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL
BE USED AGAINST...

33:53.132 --> 33:54.766
WAIT, WAIT, ARE YOU --
YOU'RE READING ME MY RIGHTS?

33:54.800 --> 33:56.735
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?!

33:56.768 --> 33:58.637
I DON'T NEED TO BE READ
MY RIGHTS! I'VE DONE
NOTHING WRONG.

33:58.670 --> 34:01.273
SO, IF I CHECK YOUR PERSONAL
AND BUSINESS ACCOUNTS,

34:01.307 --> 34:05.244
I WON'T FIND A TRANSACTION WHERE
YOU PAID MARIA FLORES $15,000?

34:05.277 --> 34:06.412
NO.
HANG ON.

34:06.445 --> 34:07.746
WAIT.

34:07.779 --> 34:10.416
WHAT?
OH, MY GOD.
NICK, YOU HAD M--

34:11.183 --> 34:13.185
HE TOLD ME TO SIGN OFF

34:13.219 --> 34:15.687
ON A $15,000 CASH DISTRIBUTION
YESTERDAY.

34:15.721 --> 34:18.857
ROBERT, STOP TALKING.
SO, YOU ADMIT YOU'RE STILL
HANDLING THE CARTEL'S MONEY?

34:18.890 --> 34:20.559
YEAH, HE TOLD ME
TO KEEP MANAGING THEIR FINANCES

34:20.592 --> 34:22.294
SO THEY WOULDN'T KNOW
THAT I WAS FLIPPING ON THEM.

34:22.328 --> 34:23.729
NO, BE QUIET, ROBERT.
YOU'RE INCRIMINATING YOURSELF!

34:23.762 --> 34:25.331
NO,
I'M INCRIMINATING YOU!

34:25.364 --> 34:26.632
HE'S BEEN TELLING ME
WHAT TO DO WITH THE MONEY

34:26.665 --> 34:28.334
EVER SINCE WE STARTED
THIS DEAL --

34:28.367 --> 34:30.336
INCLUDING
PAYING FOR MY DEFENSE.

34:30.369 --> 34:31.870
THAT'S MY CUE.
EXCUSE ME.

34:31.903 --> 34:33.372
IS THAT TRUE,
MR. RHODES?

34:35.141 --> 34:38.644
EVEN IF I WANTED TO ANSWER YOU,
I'M CONSTRAINED BY PRIVILEGE.

34:38.677 --> 34:41.513
MY FIRST AND ONLY CONCERN
MUST BE ROBERT.

34:41.547 --> 34:44.183
YOU APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN
RUNNING MR. CURTIS FOR
THE CARTEL ALL ALONG,

34:44.216 --> 34:46.118
AND THAT MAKES YOU PART
OF A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE.

34:46.152 --> 34:47.586
PRIVILEGE DOESN'T
COVER THAT.

34:47.619 --> 34:50.422
CRIMINAL ENTERPRI--
LOOK, IT'S NO SECRET

34:50.456 --> 34:52.424
ROBERT HAD MONEY
FROM THESE GUYS.

34:52.458 --> 34:54.193
BUT IT'S NOT MY MONEY.
HOW MUCH DID THEY
PROMISE YOU, NICK?

34:54.226 --> 34:55.627
WHAT?
TO HAND ME OVER
TO THOSE ANIMALS?

34:55.661 --> 34:57.329
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'D
DO TO ME IN JAIL. YOU KNOW!

34:57.363 --> 34:58.597
Rhodes: ROBERT.

34:59.865 --> 35:03.635
MR. CURTIS, YOU REMEMBER
SPECIAL AGENT FRITZ HOWARD
OF THE FBI?

35:03.669 --> 35:05.137
FBI?

35:05.171 --> 35:06.672
Fritz:
SINCE YOU JUST CONFESSED

35:06.705 --> 35:08.807
TO PAYING FOR THE ASSASSINATION
ATTEMPT ON DDA HOBBS,

35:08.840 --> 35:11.143
12 CUSTOMERS
OF THE COFFEE SHOP,

35:11.177 --> 35:12.511
AND, OF COURSE, ME,

35:12.544 --> 35:15.314
I'M HERE TO TAKE YOU
INTO FEDERAL CUSTODY.

35:15.347 --> 35:17.549
NO! THIS IS NOT RIGHT.
I HAD A DEAL.

35:17.583 --> 35:20.452
THE STATE CAN HAVE YOU
WHEN WE'RE DONE --

35:20.486 --> 35:21.720
IN ABOUT
14 LIFETIMES.

35:21.753 --> 35:22.888
BYE, ROB.

35:24.223 --> 35:25.324
IT'S BEEN FUN.

35:25.357 --> 35:26.725
YOU BITCH!

35:26.758 --> 35:29.161
I TOLD YOU TO SHUT UP,
ROBERT.

35:29.195 --> 35:31.230
NOW THEY DON'T
NEED YOU ANYMORE.

35:33.499 --> 35:35.534
THEY NEED ME.

35:38.670 --> 35:41.407
LOOK
I'M NOT THE BAD GUY HERE.

35:41.440 --> 35:44.543
HOW DID YOU BECOME THE CRIMINAL
YOU USED TO PUT IN JAIL?

35:44.576 --> 35:46.678
OH, I DON'T NEED A LECTURE
ON MORALITY

35:46.712 --> 35:48.947
FROM DEPUTY CHIEF
BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.483
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO PUT A GUY
ON THE STREET

35:51.517 --> 35:53.519
TO BE BEATEN TO DEATH,
NOT ME.

35:56.422 --> 35:58.957
OH, YEAH,
I LOOKED INTO YOU.

35:58.990 --> 36:02.728
DON'T FORGET,
I REPRESENT CRIMINALS.

36:02.761 --> 36:05.297
AND...YOU HEAR EVERYTHING
IN JAIL.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.767
JUST BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T BEAT
TURELL BAYLOR TO DEATH

36:08.800 --> 36:10.302
WITH YOUR OWN TWO HANDS

36:10.336 --> 36:13.472
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU DIDN'T KILL HIM.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.674
YOU'RE NO DIFFERENT
FROM ME.

36:15.707 --> 36:18.910
OH, MY. THIS IS TAKING
A NASTY TURN, ISN'T IT?

36:18.944 --> 36:21.280
SO...

36:22.648 --> 36:24.316
...THIS IS
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.

36:24.350 --> 36:27.586
YOU...GET ME...A DEAL.

36:27.619 --> 36:29.755
AND I GET YOU BACK
ALL THE CARTEL'S MONEY

36:29.788 --> 36:31.790
THAT I TRICKED CURTIS
INTO GIVING ME.

36:33.759 --> 36:35.327
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

36:35.361 --> 36:37.696
HOW 'BOUT YOU WRITE DOWN

36:37.729 --> 36:40.232
HOW YOU PAID
MARIA FLORES $15,000

36:40.266 --> 36:41.600
TO HELP ASSASSINATE
DDA HOBBS?

36:41.633 --> 36:43.269
AND, IN RETURN,

36:43.302 --> 36:45.003
I'LL ARREST YOU ON 14 COUNTS
OF ATTEMPTED MURDER.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.605
THAT'S THE ONLY DEAL
YOU'RE GONNA GET.

36:46.638 --> 36:47.839
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.575
WHAT?
SERIOUSLY?

36:49.608 --> 36:51.410
LOOK,
THAT IS NOT A DEAL.

36:51.443 --> 36:52.978
LISTEN, JOHNSON.

36:53.011 --> 36:57.316
WITHOUT ME, YOU WILL NEVER, EVER
FIND THE CARTEL'S MONEY.

36:57.349 --> 36:59.318
UNDERSTAND?
NEVER.

36:59.351 --> 37:01.387
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE MONEY.

37:01.420 --> 37:03.822
I CARE ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE
WHO NEARLY DIED TODAY,

37:03.855 --> 37:05.724
INCLUDING MY HUSBAND.

37:05.757 --> 37:08.794
NOW, I HAVE ENOUGH
PROBABLE CAUSE TO ARREST YOU

37:08.827 --> 37:10.396
AND SEND YOU OVER
TO COUNTY,

37:10.429 --> 37:12.798
WHERE YOU CAN LIVE IT UP
WITH ALL YOUR CARTEL FRIENDS.

37:12.831 --> 37:14.600
I'M SURE THEY'D BE THRILLED
TO SEE YOU,

37:14.633 --> 37:17.703
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING
HOW COOPERATIVE

37:17.736 --> 37:20.472
YOU JUST OFFERED
TO BE.

37:20.506 --> 37:22.974
YOU KNOW...

37:23.008 --> 37:26.044
THEY HEAR EVERYTHING
IN JAIL.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.579
WAIT, HOLD ON.

37:27.613 --> 37:28.747
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU WOULDN'T DARE.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.416
WHEN YOU SEE TURELL BAYLOR
IN HELL,

37:30.449 --> 37:32.318
YOU ASK HIM
WHAT I WOULDN'T DARE TO DO.

37:33.919 --> 37:36.288
OH, MY GOD.

37:36.322 --> 37:38.790
SHE DOESN'T MEAN IT, GAVIN.

37:38.824 --> 37:41.360
BAYLOR'S CAUSED HER
A LOT OF GRIEF.

37:41.393 --> 37:44.663
IF SHE CAN GET A LITTLE MILEAGE
OUT OF HIM, WHY NOT?

37:44.696 --> 37:47.533
AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE
TO KILL HIM MYSELF,

37:47.566 --> 37:49.835
I'LL PUT RHODES
IN PROTECTIVE CUSTODY.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.403
SO DON'T WORRY, GAVIN.

37:51.437 --> 37:53.539
THANK YOU, DEAR.
THAT WOULD BE A BIG HELP.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.908
MY GOD, THIS WOMAN.

38:00.746 --> 38:02.714
NO, NO, NO, NO. LOOK.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT --

38:02.748 --> 38:06.752
PUT THAT PEN TO PAPER.
BE QUICK...OR BE GONE.

38:20.966 --> 38:23.034
Buzz:
I HEARD THE CHIEF AGREE

38:23.068 --> 38:24.536
TO PROTECT TURELL'S
MOTHER AND SISTER,

38:24.570 --> 38:26.338
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHO'S
LOOKING INTO HIS MURDER.

38:26.372 --> 38:28.840
I'M A CIVILIAN TECH.
I'M NOT A POLICE OFFICER.

38:28.874 --> 38:32.411
AND DID THE CHIEF OR
DETECTIVES GABRIEL AND SANCHEZ

38:32.444 --> 38:34.846
SPEAK TO YOU AFTER THEY
DROPPED TURELL OFF AT HIS HOUSE?

38:36.648 --> 38:37.916
YES.

38:37.949 --> 38:42.354
CHIEF JOHNSON ASKED ME
IF I HAD ANY DING DONGS.

38:42.388 --> 38:44.356
EXCUSE ME?

38:44.390 --> 38:46.525
SHE SOMETIMES HAS DING DONGS
ON ROUGH DAYS,

38:46.558 --> 38:48.827
AND AFTER SHE CAME BACK,
SHE RAN OUT.

38:48.860 --> 38:51.029
HMM.

38:51.062 --> 38:53.899
ALWAYS TOUGH
RUNNING OUT OF DING DONGS.

38:53.932 --> 38:57.769
OKAY, SO, LET'S JUST
GO OVER THESE QUESTIONS AGAIN

38:57.803 --> 38:59.738
AND MAKE SURE
WE GOT THEM ALL RIGHT.

39:01.473 --> 39:03.375
I CAN SAVE YOU SOME TIME.

39:03.409 --> 39:05.744
NUMBER ONE, NO.
NUMBER TWO, NO.

39:05.777 --> 39:07.479
NUMBER THREE...
WE'LL COME BACK TO.

39:07.513 --> 39:09.848
NUMBER FOUR,
I DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T CARE.

39:09.881 --> 39:11.650
NUMBER FIVE, ALSO NO.

39:11.683 --> 39:14.586
NOW, BACK TO NUMBER THREE
FOR A SECOND.

39:14.620 --> 39:19.491
"HAVE I DISCUSSED THIS CASE WITH
ANYONE OUTSIDE MAJOR CRIMES?"

39:19.525 --> 39:21.026
HAVE YOU?

39:26.498 --> 39:29.601
LOVE YOU, LOVE YOUR WORK,
BUT I'M OUT OF HERE.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.611
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
LISTEN UP, EVERYONE.

39:39.645 --> 39:41.780
NOW, I KNOW WE'VE ALL
BEEN THROUGH HELL

39:41.813 --> 39:44.416
BECAUSE OF THIS DAMN
WITCH HUNT,

39:44.450 --> 39:47.118
BUT THESE QUESTIONS IMPLY
THAT ONE OF US

39:47.152 --> 39:49.521
IS COOPERATING
WITH THE BAYLORS' ATTORNEY.

39:49.555 --> 39:51.623
AND I FIND THAT INSULTING
TO MY CHARACTER

39:51.657 --> 39:55.494
AND TO THAT OF EVERYONE ELSE
IN THIS ROOM.

39:55.527 --> 39:58.163
FOR THE RECORD,
I FIND IT INSULTING, TOO.

39:58.196 --> 39:59.865
Raydor: WELL,
FOR THE RECORD, AS WELL,

39:59.898 --> 40:02.668
THERE'S SIMPLY NO WAY
THAT MR. GOLDMAN KNOWS

40:02.701 --> 40:05.937
WHAT HE KNOWS ABOUT MAJOR CRIMES
WITHOUT INSIDE INFORMATION.

40:05.971 --> 40:09.975
SO, SOMEWHERE IN THIS DIVISION,
THERE'S A LEAK.

40:15.046 --> 40:17.516
OKAY, THEN.

40:17.549 --> 40:18.784
WELL,
IT WAS REALLY NICE

40:18.817 --> 40:20.919
SPENDING TIME
WITH ALL OF YOU TODAY.

40:20.952 --> 40:22.754
WE'LL BE MEETING
AGAIN SOON.

40:22.788 --> 40:24.022
Flynn:
WAIT UP, GAVIN.

40:25.090 --> 40:26.191
DID YOU LEARN ANYTHING?

40:27.526 --> 40:30.829
NOTHING I DIDN'T
ALREADY SUSPECT.

40:30.862 --> 40:33.699
SEE, EVERYONE HERE
TALKS TO EVERYONE ELSE HERE

40:33.732 --> 40:34.866
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

40:34.900 --> 40:37.002
SO, IF ONE PERSON
KNOWS SOMETHING,

40:37.035 --> 40:38.904
YOU ALL DO.

40:40.506 --> 40:43.008
SO, TO THAT LEAK
THAT YOU DON'T THINK EXISTS...

40:44.743 --> 40:47.779
...CAN YOU PLEASE TELL
MR. GOLDMAN...

40:49.214 --> 40:52.050
...THAT HE CAN SNEAK AROUND
ALL HE WANTS TO,

40:52.083 --> 40:56.021
BUT IF THIS CASE EVER
GETS TO A COURTROOM...

40:57.689 --> 40:59.157
...I WIN.

41:01.259 --> 41:03.094
NO MATTER WHAT HE THINKS
HE KNOWS...

41:04.563 --> 41:06.231
...I WIN.

41:06.264 --> 41:08.700
NO MATTER WHAT LIES
HE GETS PASSED...

41:10.168 --> 41:12.804
...I WIN.

41:14.706 --> 41:17.976
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,
PLEASE BE SAFE, EVERYBODY.

41:18.009 --> 41:21.246
IT IS A ROUGH WORLD
OUT THERE.

41:21.279 --> 41:24.616
AND IT'S GETTING ROUGHER
EVERY DAY.
