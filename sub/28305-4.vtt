00:01.958 --> 00:03.612
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Friends,
as you know, Jane was happily

00:03.655 --> 00:07.398
in love with her baby daddy,
Rafael, but then

00:07.442 --> 00:09.966
her husband returned.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.403
Mommy! Michael came back
from the dead!

00:12.447 --> 00:13.578
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know!

00:13.622 --> 00:14.927
And even crazier,
he had amnesia.

00:14.971 --> 00:17.234
I go by Jason now, ma'am.

00:17.278 --> 00:19.236
NARRATOR: And speaking
of complicated relationships,

00:19.280 --> 00:21.064
Alba married
her ex-boyfriend Jorge

00:21.108 --> 00:23.893
so he could get his green card
and visit his sick mother.

00:23.936 --> 00:25.982
Only problem,
she still loved him,

00:26.026 --> 00:28.245
but that was nothing
compared to this heartbreak.

00:28.289 --> 00:30.291
I have breast cancer.

00:30.334 --> 00:32.771
NARRATOR: But Xo was staying
strong through her chemo

00:32.815 --> 00:34.251
and getting close to the end.

00:34.295 --> 00:37.602
And speaking of the end,
Jane said goodbye to Jason.

00:37.646 --> 00:38.951
The divorce papers.

00:38.995 --> 00:40.953
So long, Jane.

00:40.997 --> 00:43.478
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But alas, this is a telenovela.

00:50.311 --> 00:52.443
So let's see what happens next.

00:55.142 --> 00:56.969
As you may recall,

00:57.013 --> 01:00.756
when Jane Gloriana Villanueva
was a young girl, she dreamed

01:00.799 --> 01:03.193
about finding
her long-lost father.

01:03.237 --> 01:04.629
LORENZO LAMAS:
Hey, there.

01:04.673 --> 01:08.285
All this time, you were right.
I'm your dad, Jane.

01:08.329 --> 01:11.201
Really, Lorenzo Lamas?Truly.

01:11.245 --> 01:14.335
And I can't wait to take
long walks and read books

01:14.378 --> 01:16.293
and have tea parties together.

01:16.337 --> 01:19.122
I love you, Jane,

01:19.166 --> 01:20.732
so much.

01:20.776 --> 01:24.084
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But alas,
there is a thin line

01:24.127 --> 01:26.738
between our biggest dreams...

01:26.782 --> 01:29.089
and our worst nightmares.

01:29.132 --> 01:30.786
Now that we've
found each other,

01:30.829 --> 01:32.657
I'm gonna take you away
from your mom...

01:32.701 --> 01:33.789
and your abuela,

01:33.832 --> 01:36.313
and you'll never see them again.

01:36.357 --> 01:38.794
What? No!Yes!

01:54.331 --> 01:55.811
Nightmare?

01:55.854 --> 01:57.726
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Luckily, after a bad dream,

01:57.769 --> 02:00.685
Xiomara was always there
to comfort her.

02:00.729 --> 02:03.297
You're okay. It's not real.

02:08.215 --> 02:09.868
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But Xo couldn't help her

02:09.912 --> 02:12.044
with her new
recurring nightmare.

02:12.088 --> 02:15.047
Or maybe she could, but alas,
she wasn't there.

02:15.091 --> 02:17.093
RAFAEL:
Same bad dream?

02:21.184 --> 02:24.535
Do you remember it
this time?

02:24.579 --> 02:28.409
No. I'm okay,
don't worry.

02:30.411 --> 02:35.372
Try to get some rest, okay?
It's not real.

02:35.416 --> 02:37.983
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I agree,
she should get some rest

02:38.027 --> 02:39.898
because tomorrow,
when Jane finds out

02:39.942 --> 02:43.032
that Michael
got his memories back,

02:43.075 --> 02:46.688
things are going to get
very real.

02:46.731 --> 02:49.169
Which brings us here, now.

02:49.212 --> 02:50.344
Oh, my God.

02:50.387 --> 02:51.736
NARRATOR:
Is that an "I just learned

02:51.780 --> 02:53.564
Michael got his memories back
'oh, my God'"?

02:53.608 --> 02:55.436
I forgot about Grandparents' Day
at Mateo's school.

02:55.479 --> 02:58.003
NARRATOR: I really would've gone
with an "oh, my gosh" for that.

02:58.047 --> 02:59.527
One of the parents
called to confirm.

02:59.570 --> 03:01.224
My mom has her last chemo
tomorrow morning;

03:01.268 --> 03:02.921
there's no way
she'll be up for that.

03:02.965 --> 03:04.445
You think Alba could step in?

03:04.488 --> 03:05.837
Yes.

03:05.881 --> 03:09.101
Ooh, good idea. Okay.

03:09.145 --> 03:10.625
You expecting someone?

03:10.668 --> 03:12.888
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Could it be Michael?

03:14.977 --> 03:18.981
Oh... you remembered.

03:20.243 --> 03:21.331
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, come on!

03:21.375 --> 03:23.812
That's not even a thing!

03:23.855 --> 03:25.640
Are you kidding?
Of course I remembered.

03:25.683 --> 03:30.035
Today is the day that you became
a published friggin' author.

03:31.254 --> 03:34.039
Personally, I think it should be
a national holiday.

03:36.346 --> 03:37.956
Thank you.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.437
I am so ready to leave
the last few weeks behind us

03:40.481 --> 03:41.960
and get back to our life.

03:42.004 --> 03:43.310
Which should be easier

03:43.353 --> 03:45.050
since Jason's leaving today.

03:45.094 --> 03:46.356
Oh, is that today?

03:46.400 --> 03:48.489
I hadn't thought
about that at all.

03:48.532 --> 03:51.840
I feel like things
are getting back to normal.

03:57.019 --> 03:59.543
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah, not for long.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.641
JANE:
Everything has changed.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.730
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Uh-oh. Here we go.

04:12.774 --> 04:15.080
"Alba Gloriana
Villanueva,

04:15.124 --> 04:17.213
I thought I was happy
before I met you..."

04:17.257 --> 04:18.693
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Or not.

04:18.736 --> 04:21.478
"...but now that
I'm away from you,

04:21.522 --> 04:24.133
I know that I can't be
happy without you."

04:24.176 --> 04:26.918
Wow.

04:28.398 --> 04:30.270
Yeah, b-but that's
the point, Abuela.

04:30.313 --> 04:31.749
Jorge's letters
have to convince Immigration

04:31.793 --> 04:34.186
that you two are in love,
so he can get his papers.

04:37.886 --> 04:40.497
Maybe.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.586
But I don't want you
to get your hopes up.

04:42.630 --> 04:45.285
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, I'd say it's too late for that.

04:54.598 --> 04:56.383
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Okay, that's got to be a

04:56.426 --> 04:58.036
"My husband who came back

04:58.080 --> 05:00.125
from the dead with amnesia just
got his memories back" gasp.

05:00.169 --> 05:03.259
I thought my shift started
at 10:00, but I was on at 9:00.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.435
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Seriously?
My nerves can't take this!

05:05.479 --> 05:08.090
I got to go.MICHAEL: Yeah, I got to go

05:08.133 --> 05:10.353
to the bus station.
Can you call me a cab, please?

05:10.397 --> 05:11.789
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wait, he's leaving?

05:11.833 --> 05:13.356
But he hasn't told Jane...

05:38.250 --> 05:40.688
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wait, Jane, wait.

05:44.474 --> 05:47.303
Hi, there. Just checking out.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.610
"911"? Where's the emergency?

05:49.653 --> 05:51.002
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Downstairs!

05:51.046 --> 05:52.526
Michael's about to leave!

05:52.569 --> 05:56.356
Here! I need to figure out
what to do about J.R. fast.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.619
Look, your "accidental"
butt-dial plan worked.

05:58.662 --> 06:00.185
Okay, J.R.
wrote me back

06:00.229 --> 06:02.274
and she asked if everything
was okay, so I said,

06:02.318 --> 06:04.102
"Sorry. Butt-dial,"
and then she wrote this.

06:06.496 --> 06:10.282
Ooh, asking a question,
that's a good sign.Right?

06:10.326 --> 06:11.501
So then I wrote this.

06:13.503 --> 06:17.072
And then, nothing.
She didn't write back.

06:17.115 --> 06:18.247
So what do I do?

06:18.290 --> 06:20.292
I should send a
follow-up text, right?

06:20.336 --> 06:22.643
No, no, no.
Ball's in her court.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.340
Now, I should really
get back to work.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.907
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yes, good, go!

06:25.950 --> 06:27.299
Wait!LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: No!

06:27.343 --> 06:29.171
Are you sure I shouldn't
say anything more?

06:29.214 --> 06:31.782
Yes, I'm sure.
Let her respond.

06:31.826 --> 06:33.654
I'm leaving.LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yes!

06:33.697 --> 06:36.265
Hurry! Run!

06:38.659 --> 06:41.139
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay,
look right, Jane, look right.

06:49.452 --> 06:51.802
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends, in that moment,

06:51.846 --> 06:54.022
when she saw that way
he looked at her,

06:54.065 --> 06:56.894
Jane finally knew
what she didn't know.

06:59.070 --> 07:02.552
And it was like a rug had been
pulled out from under her.

07:04.075 --> 07:06.904
Sorry, didn't
see you there.

07:06.948 --> 07:08.558
JANE:
Oh...

07:08.602 --> 07:10.908
Uh...

07:10.952 --> 07:12.736
I need a car, any car.

07:12.780 --> 07:16.261
I can't just
give you a car.
Wha...

07:16.305 --> 07:18.960
Oh! Can I borrow this for a sec?

07:39.981 --> 07:42.462
Stop!

07:42.505 --> 07:43.898
The hell you doing, lady?

07:43.941 --> 07:45.290
I'm sorry, but this bus
can't go to Montana

07:45.334 --> 07:46.553
until I talk
to someone on board.

07:46.596 --> 07:48.032
I'm not going to Montana.

07:48.076 --> 07:50.121
I'm going to
Fontana, California.

07:52.733 --> 07:54.125
Oh. Well, do you know
where the buses

07:54.169 --> 07:55.300
that are going to Montana are?

07:55.344 --> 07:56.998
One leaving for Billings
right now.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.102
Michael?

08:15.190 --> 08:17.235
Hi, Jane.

08:29.204 --> 08:30.553
You remembered?

08:32.642 --> 08:35.340
Then why were you gonna leave?

08:35.384 --> 08:38.779
I just... should.

08:38.822 --> 08:40.476
I only got off the bus

08:40.520 --> 08:42.478
'cause I saw you
almost get run over

08:42.522 --> 08:45.612
and I decided I probably
shouldn't end things that way.

08:45.655 --> 08:48.484
I don't understand.

08:48.528 --> 08:52.880
It's been four years, Jane.
You have a life.

08:52.923 --> 08:54.882
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And,
friends, that was just about

08:54.925 --> 08:57.362
the most Michael thing
he could possibly say.

08:57.406 --> 08:58.973
Is that what you want?

08:59.016 --> 09:01.497
I just want you to be happy.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.933
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Or maybe that was.

09:02.977 --> 09:04.848
Do you want to talk?

09:09.810 --> 09:12.116
I need to call Rafael.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.162
Hey, I've only got a minute.

09:14.205 --> 09:15.816
I'm about to leave
for the open house

09:15.859 --> 09:18.340
and I am carpooling
with the lead agent.

09:18.383 --> 09:19.863
Living the dream, baby!

09:19.907 --> 09:21.561
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oof, he really doesn't know

09:21.604 --> 09:22.736
what he doesn't know.

09:22.779 --> 09:24.868
Jane, are you there?

09:24.912 --> 09:28.872
Yeah, sorry. Um, I-I was just
calling to wish you good luck.

09:28.916 --> 09:31.527
You okay?Yeah.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.398
I'll pick you up after work?

09:33.442 --> 09:37.098
Can't wait. Love you.

09:41.885 --> 09:45.193
I love you, too, so much. Bye.

09:51.373 --> 09:53.114
Jane, stop sending me
to voice mail.

09:53.157 --> 09:54.768
Look, J.R. wrote me back
and she said,

09:54.811 --> 09:57.988
"I miss you, too, but that
doesn't change anything."

09:58.032 --> 10:00.338
Call me back to discuss
how to respond.

10:00.382 --> 10:04.255
Sorry to bother you,
Miss Solano,

10:04.299 --> 10:07.302
but, um, I don't know how to act
around the pirate you hired.

10:07.345 --> 10:09.347
What pirate?
I didn't hire a pirate.

10:09.391 --> 10:12.873
You know, the really mean one
with the hook and the eye patch?

10:12.916 --> 10:14.570
Telling fortunes?

10:16.746 --> 10:19.575
What are you
doing, Mother?
Working.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.665
I need cash since you killed
my source of income.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.711
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Actually,
she pushed it out the window.

10:27.844 --> 10:29.716
You cannot stay here, Mother.

10:29.759 --> 10:31.413
No problem.

10:31.456 --> 10:35.243
I'm happy to move to the
boardwalk for $100,000.

10:35.286 --> 10:38.202
You're not getting a dime!
Get out or...

10:39.290 --> 10:40.814
I'll sue you for trespassing.

10:40.857 --> 10:43.599
My cruel daughter,

10:43.643 --> 10:45.732
who owns this
beautiful hotel,

10:45.775 --> 10:48.517
will not let her
own mother sit here

10:48.560 --> 10:50.824
in the nice, cool
air conditioning.

10:50.867 --> 10:52.347
This is elder abuse!

10:54.479 --> 10:57.395
There's no problem.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.659
You can stay here, for now.

10:59.702 --> 11:01.095
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah, I'm not sure

11:01.138 --> 11:02.400
that's such a good idea.

11:02.444 --> 11:04.272
Get me a restraining order
against my mother.

11:04.315 --> 11:06.970
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And from
one nightmare to another.

11:07.014 --> 11:09.407
Rogelio, thanks for
coming in for reshoots.

11:09.451 --> 11:11.627
We just need one more
close-up and the network

11:11.671 --> 11:13.585
will green-light
the whole series.

11:13.629 --> 11:15.457
So just bring
the sexy, okay?

11:15.500 --> 11:18.329
Please, I bleed sexy.

11:25.815 --> 11:28.122
You okay?
You dozed off.

11:28.165 --> 11:29.514
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Actually, friends,

11:29.558 --> 11:31.516
that used to be Rogelio's
worst nightmare...

11:37.392 --> 11:40.264
...before reality became
even scarier.

11:40.308 --> 11:43.441
Oh, it's amazing.
I'm excited to have something

11:43.485 --> 11:45.835
so beautiful to look at
for my last session.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.663
I'm also excited about

11:47.707 --> 11:49.143
Grandparents' Day.

11:49.186 --> 11:51.493
But Mommy said you weren't
coming and Bisa was.

11:51.536 --> 11:54.017
What? I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

11:58.413 --> 11:59.849
No way.

11:59.893 --> 12:02.722
I'm going to Grandparents' Day,
end of story.

12:02.765 --> 12:04.898
I can't wait to get out
of my sweatpants

12:04.941 --> 12:06.116
and feel pretty again.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.988
Mm!

12:08.031 --> 12:09.641
I bought you
a new jacket to wear.

12:09.685 --> 12:11.078
Want to go upstairs
and try it on?

12:11.121 --> 12:12.557
Yeah!

13:23.106 --> 13:24.586
Wow.

13:24.629 --> 13:27.589
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well, Alba may not be keeping

13:27.632 --> 13:30.157
her feelings in check,

13:30.200 --> 13:33.334
but Jane and Michael
were definitely trying to.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.423
Nope. Still don't
like Cubanos.

13:38.078 --> 13:40.776
What?

13:40.820 --> 13:44.301
It's weird.
I feel like two people.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.438
So...

13:50.481 --> 13:53.006
Baby Michaelina?

13:53.049 --> 13:54.355
For real?

13:54.398 --> 13:55.747
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And suddenly, friends,

13:55.791 --> 13:59.055
it began to feel
just a little like old times.

13:59.099 --> 14:00.361
Can't believe
you have a sister.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.363
We're like family,
I'm not kidding.

14:02.406 --> 14:04.844
You and Petra? Damn!

14:04.887 --> 14:07.368
I have actually said the words
"I love you" to her.

14:07.411 --> 14:09.544
It was so emotional.
There I was,

14:09.587 --> 14:12.808
elbow-deep in a mare,
and then whoosh,

14:12.852 --> 14:15.376
it just sort of gushed out,
straight into my arms.

14:15.419 --> 14:16.856
It was more painful
than giving birth.

14:16.899 --> 14:17.987
What were you
thinking?

14:18.031 --> 14:19.510
I don't know.

14:19.554 --> 14:22.513
He jumped off the roof,
so I jumped, and then, crack!

14:22.557 --> 14:25.647
Peer pressure.You could've died.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.518
What else could I do?
The boys dared me

14:27.562 --> 14:29.869
to rope that crazy steed,
so I did.

14:29.912 --> 14:33.002
Of course I'm happy
I did it, but honestly,

14:33.046 --> 14:34.830
I think everyone
who bought a book

14:34.874 --> 14:38.486
was either related to me
or a Rogelio superfan.

14:38.529 --> 14:39.879
Still,

14:39.922 --> 14:42.664
you, Jane Gloriana Villanueva,

14:42.707 --> 14:45.885
are a published freaking author.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.887
I'm so proud of you.

14:52.239 --> 14:54.763
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Maybe a little too much like old times.

14:57.418 --> 14:59.681
I'm sorry.

14:59.724 --> 15:01.901
I know this is a lot.

15:01.944 --> 15:05.121
Plus, I know you obviously
need to process

15:05.165 --> 15:07.254
every word of this conversation
on the porch swing

15:07.297 --> 15:09.386
with every single person
in your family.

15:10.692 --> 15:12.520
Look, I want you
to take the lead here,

15:12.563 --> 15:15.523
but I know what I want.

15:15.566 --> 15:17.220
What?

15:17.264 --> 15:19.701
I still love you, Jane.

15:26.316 --> 15:29.015
I have to pick up Rafael.

15:38.328 --> 15:40.504
You just kissed
the new lead agent

15:40.548 --> 15:41.941
on the Sutton Street house.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.552
I'm so happy for you.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.380
What's wrong?

15:46.423 --> 15:49.949
Michael got his memories back.

15:52.386 --> 15:56.042
It's a lot, I know.

15:56.085 --> 15:58.131
Are you okay?

16:00.133 --> 16:02.352
Well, it depends.

16:02.396 --> 16:05.877
Are you still getting a divorce?

16:05.921 --> 16:08.228
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Friends, it should be noted

16:08.271 --> 16:11.709
that at this moment, all Jane
wanted to do was scream yes.

16:11.753 --> 16:14.538
So this changes things.

16:14.582 --> 16:17.106
I don't want it to.Then don't let it, Jane.

16:27.769 --> 16:29.075
All I want

16:29.118 --> 16:31.425
is to put this ring
on your finger.

16:31.468 --> 16:34.036
Please, just send in

16:34.080 --> 16:36.821
the divorce papers, so we can
move on with our lives.

16:36.865 --> 16:40.042
I...

16:40.086 --> 16:42.392
I just need a beat.

16:42.436 --> 16:45.656
Please, this just happened.

16:48.485 --> 16:49.878
I'm going to bed.

17:02.151 --> 17:04.632
I love you.I love you, too.

17:04.675 --> 17:07.809
And I can't wait to marry you.

17:07.852 --> 17:09.680
We can have it all--

17:09.724 --> 17:11.856
the romance, the family.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.858
We can watch
Mateo grow up,

17:13.902 --> 17:15.643
and we can all drink tea.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.384
MICHAEL: I like
tea, too, Jane.

17:17.427 --> 17:19.429
And you still
love me.

17:19.473 --> 17:21.040
RAFAEL:
Darjeeling

17:21.083 --> 17:23.172
for my darling?

17:23.216 --> 17:27.829
I have Earl Grey, and you
loved Earl Grey first.

17:27.872 --> 17:29.265
TEACUP:
Jane, run!

17:34.792 --> 17:37.578
I love tea so much, Jane!I love tea more!

17:37.621 --> 17:39.580
Drink my tea!No one loves tea more than me.

17:53.202 --> 17:55.422
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
So, yeah, now you understand

17:55.465 --> 17:57.119
why she didn't want
to tell Rafael

17:57.163 --> 17:59.121
about her recurring nightmare.

18:03.908 --> 18:05.693
PETRA:
Where the hell is Jane?

18:05.736 --> 18:07.173
Temp! Find Jane!

18:07.216 --> 18:09.131
I've sent her 17 messages
and she hasn't answered.

18:09.175 --> 18:10.654
Petra Solano?

18:10.698 --> 18:12.221
Yes.

18:12.265 --> 18:14.789
You've been served.

18:19.533 --> 18:23.580
You're suing me for
emotional distress? Seriously?

18:23.624 --> 18:25.060
I saw my one daughter

18:25.104 --> 18:27.018
throw the other daughter
out the window.

18:27.062 --> 18:30.761
It was very distressing.
Every mother's worst nightmare.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.415
Oh, please.

18:32.459 --> 18:34.025
I am going to bury you in court.

18:34.069 --> 18:36.767
Perhaps, but that
could take months,

18:36.811 --> 18:38.943
years maybe.

18:38.987 --> 18:43.731
It will cost you a lot of money,
but if you give me directly,

18:43.774 --> 18:45.124
might be easier.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.516
I'd pay the lawyers
a million dollars

18:46.560 --> 18:48.518
before I gave you a cent.

18:48.562 --> 18:52.174
Look.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.568
I know you think
you're better than me,

18:54.611 --> 18:56.613
but according
to the cards,

18:56.657 --> 18:58.789
you will end up just like me.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.574
Mother, that is my
worst nightmare.

19:00.617 --> 19:02.619
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: True, for
the record. Let me show you.

19:02.663 --> 19:05.709
Ellie, wait. I need money.

19:05.753 --> 19:07.711
You can't abandon
your poor mother.

19:07.755 --> 19:09.844
You know I always
loved you best.

19:09.887 --> 19:12.368
Anna! At least help me
buy scratch-offs.

19:12.412 --> 19:14.805
Please! You know you're
Mummy's favorite.

19:14.849 --> 19:17.286
I've filed
for a restraining order.

19:17.330 --> 19:21.334
But you don't have one yet,
so I stay.

19:31.344 --> 19:33.650
Michael got his memory back?

19:33.694 --> 19:36.175
Did he ask about me?

19:36.218 --> 19:38.394
Does he want to see me?

19:38.438 --> 19:40.179
Does he still love me?

19:40.222 --> 19:44.748
Yes, yes and yes.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.750
And he loves me, too.

19:51.799 --> 19:53.409
I-I don't know
what to do.

19:53.453 --> 19:56.499
I love Rafael so much, and
I-I just can't bring myself

19:56.543 --> 19:58.109
to mail the
divorce papers.

19:58.153 --> 20:02.070
So sorry, hon. I can't imagine
how horrible you must feel.

20:06.901 --> 20:09.860
Dad, what do
you think?

20:09.904 --> 20:13.255
Well, I-I always thought
I was Team Michael,

20:13.299 --> 20:14.952
but I do love Rafael as well,

20:14.996 --> 20:17.607
so I no longer feel comfortable
expressing my opinion.

20:17.651 --> 20:21.263
Really? This is the moment you
choose not to have an opinion?

20:23.309 --> 20:25.398
I just wish somebody
would tell me what to do.

20:28.096 --> 20:30.359
And who keeps texting you?

20:46.332 --> 20:49.813
Petra. Petra...

20:49.857 --> 20:51.554
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us to...

20:51.598 --> 20:53.121
Petra.
Finally!

20:53.164 --> 20:55.297
What took so long? My temp's
been out searching for you.

20:55.341 --> 20:57.734
Ugh, I'm sorry.

20:57.778 --> 21:00.607
Michael got his memory back
and Rafael is mad at me

21:00.650 --> 21:02.086
because I won't mail
the divorce papers

21:02.130 --> 21:03.827
and my mom had her
final chemo today,

21:03.871 --> 21:05.481
so there's just, like,
a lot going on.

21:05.525 --> 21:07.091
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Excuses, excuses.

21:07.135 --> 21:08.876
Excuses, excuses.

21:08.919 --> 21:10.530
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Hey, that was my joke.

21:10.573 --> 21:11.922
That's actually
why I came here.

21:11.966 --> 21:13.794
Nobody will give me
clear advice,

21:13.837 --> 21:15.665
but I know you will have
an actual opinion

21:15.709 --> 21:17.232
on what I should do
about Michael.

21:19.060 --> 21:21.932
Okay, fine. We can talk about
your thing for five minutes.

21:21.976 --> 21:25.458
Then you need to help me figure
out what to write back to J.R.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.634
Deal. Give it
to me straight.

21:27.677 --> 21:29.331
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
How about straight up?

21:29.375 --> 21:30.898
The choice is clear:

21:30.941 --> 21:33.509
divorce Michael,
stay with Rafael.

21:33.553 --> 21:36.033
Really? It's that simple?

21:36.077 --> 21:37.818
You and Rafael are destined
for each other.

21:37.861 --> 21:39.254
Even when I was
with Rafael,

21:39.298 --> 21:40.908
fate kept throwing
the two of you together.

21:40.951 --> 21:42.301
It was so annoying.

21:42.344 --> 21:46.522
I love him so much,
and our family.

21:46.566 --> 21:51.048
Exactly. Michael's your past,
Rafael is your future.

21:54.835 --> 21:57.881
You're right,
I can't go back.

21:57.925 --> 22:01.320
But on the other hand,
it's not that simple.

22:01.363 --> 22:04.192
It's not Michael's fault,
what happened to him.

22:04.235 --> 22:06.499
H-How could I just
walk away from him?

22:08.718 --> 22:10.807
Because it's been four years,

22:10.851 --> 22:12.635
and you have a totally
new life now

22:12.679 --> 22:13.941
that you keep saying you want.

22:13.984 --> 22:15.769
I do want it.

22:15.812 --> 22:17.423
And you said there was
absolutely no chemistry

22:17.466 --> 22:19.425
when you went fishing with him.There wasn't,

22:19.468 --> 22:22.776
but yesterday there was
definitely... more.

22:22.819 --> 22:25.518
An echo
from the past.

22:25.561 --> 22:28.172
Look, life is about
making tough decisions.

22:28.216 --> 22:29.522
You can't keep going in circles.

22:29.565 --> 22:31.219
And also, it's been
over half an hour,

22:31.262 --> 22:33.482
and I said we could talk
about this for five minutes.

22:33.526 --> 22:36.964
You're right.
Your turn.

22:37.007 --> 22:39.662
Read it out loud
one more time.

22:44.406 --> 22:45.886
"You're right.

22:45.929 --> 22:48.367
"Missing me doesn't
change anything,

22:48.410 --> 22:51.021
but being with you
changed me."

22:51.065 --> 22:52.371
You don't think
it's overkill?

22:52.414 --> 22:54.198
I need this to be your
best writing, Jane.

22:54.242 --> 22:56.636
It's perfect. Trust me,
I'm a romance novelist.

22:56.679 --> 22:58.028
I know, but I'm
just saying,

22:58.072 --> 23:00.030
I need this to be
a best seller.

23:00.074 --> 23:02.206
Okay.

23:02.250 --> 23:04.600
Writers use the rule of three

23:04.644 --> 23:07.081
when they want maximum
emotional impact.

23:07.124 --> 23:10.911
You should add a third
reference to "change."

23:10.954 --> 23:13.914
"It's change I can't undo.

23:13.957 --> 23:16.177
"Now that I'm
away from you,

23:16.220 --> 23:21.443
I know more than ever
I can't be happy without you."

23:21.487 --> 23:23.010
I love it.
Good.

23:23.053 --> 23:24.533
I plagiarized that last part
from a letter

23:24.577 --> 23:25.752
Jorge wrote to my grandma.

23:25.795 --> 23:29.364
To Jorge.
To Jorge!

23:29.408 --> 23:33.150
It's brilliant.
I hereby award you,

23:33.194 --> 23:34.369
Jane Villanueva,

23:34.413 --> 23:38.199
the Pulitzer Prize
for Text Writing.

23:39.809 --> 23:42.508
Are you gonna actually send
the Pulitzer Prize-winning text?

23:42.551 --> 23:45.424
I'll send the text
if you send the divorce papers.

23:45.467 --> 23:47.295
Deal.

23:48.731 --> 23:50.951
Are you ready?

23:50.994 --> 23:53.736
BOTH:
Three... two...

23:53.780 --> 23:56.957
one!

23:58.828 --> 24:02.353
We did it.
Woo-woo!

24:02.397 --> 24:04.747
What you have here
are two decisive women

24:04.791 --> 24:07.446
making decisions
decisively.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.404
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Kids, for the record,

24:09.448 --> 24:11.058
don't drink and decide.

24:11.101 --> 24:12.755
And then it happened, friends.

24:12.799 --> 24:14.191
In a moment
of divine intervention,

24:14.235 --> 24:18.457
or sheer coincidence,
Jane saw him.

24:21.068 --> 24:25.246
Hey. So, uh,
how did the visit go

24:25.289 --> 24:26.595
with your madre?

24:26.639 --> 24:28.902
It was, it was really nice.

24:30.904 --> 24:34.211
Thank you for stopping me
at the bus station.

24:34.255 --> 24:36.126
It's been, uh, really painful,

24:36.170 --> 24:39.260
but doesn't mean I should
just run away from it.

24:40.827 --> 24:42.959
Or run away from
my feelings for you.

24:43.003 --> 24:46.136
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay,
see that look on her face?

24:46.180 --> 24:49.183
It's regret, my friends.
Which is why...

24:53.100 --> 24:57.496
That is so... so true.

24:57.539 --> 24:59.193
I have to go.

25:03.850 --> 25:06.026
I-I dropped something off
in the mail earlier,

25:06.069 --> 25:07.549
but I need to get it back.

25:07.593 --> 25:10.900
Sorry, the mailman just left.

25:12.119 --> 25:13.381
Wait!

25:21.911 --> 25:23.086
Sorry.

25:23.130 --> 25:24.131
Hi. I-I just need
the envelope back

25:24.174 --> 25:25.349
that I mailed
by accident.
Sorry.

25:25.393 --> 25:26.699
It's a federal crime
to tamper with mail

25:26.742 --> 25:28.178
once it's in the
carrier's possession.

25:28.222 --> 25:29.876
Please! I-I understand,
but it was a mistake,

25:29.919 --> 25:31.878
and-and it just happened.
Isn't there a grace period?

25:31.921 --> 25:33.749
Nope, can't break the rules.

25:33.793 --> 25:35.534
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, please. I have it

25:35.577 --> 25:36.883
on good authority that he
pockets his share

25:36.926 --> 25:38.885
of Bed Bath & Beyond coupons.

25:38.928 --> 25:43.846
Please, sir. I-I would never
want to be a tamperer-er-er,

25:43.890 --> 25:46.893
but maybe you can make
an exception.

25:46.936 --> 25:48.677
Sorry, no can do.

25:48.721 --> 25:51.245
My husband came back
from the dead!

25:54.988 --> 25:58.208
So, I mean, obviously
it's complicated,

25:58.252 --> 26:00.384
and I shouldn't have made
such a rash decision.

26:00.428 --> 26:02.386
Yeah, you can't rush that.

26:02.430 --> 26:05.172
Exactly, Steve, and...

26:05.215 --> 26:07.348
and I think it's just because
I'm overwhelmed with everything

26:07.391 --> 26:08.784
that's happening...

26:08.828 --> 26:10.264
You're not gonna
cry again, are you?

26:10.307 --> 26:12.048
No.

26:12.092 --> 26:13.789
: Maybe a little.

26:13.833 --> 26:15.574
Please.

26:15.617 --> 26:17.532
There's nothing
you can do?

26:17.576 --> 26:20.274
Look, I-I just can't
break the law.

26:20.317 --> 26:23.233
Oh...However...

26:23.277 --> 26:27.411
if I were to, say,
turn away to tie my shoe,

26:27.455 --> 26:29.500
and something
just disappeared

26:29.544 --> 26:30.937
out of my bag,

26:30.980 --> 26:33.113
I guess there's nothing really
I could do about it.

26:41.904 --> 26:44.037
Uh, how's the
other shoe doing?

26:44.080 --> 26:47.562
Oh, look at that.
It came undone, too.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.655
Steve.

27:03.709 --> 27:06.625
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah,
it's so hard to get work done

27:06.668 --> 27:07.800
when you're lovesick...

27:07.843 --> 27:09.976
...and wasted.

27:13.675 --> 27:16.112
Hello?RAFAEL: Hey, it's me.

27:16.156 --> 27:17.723
Oh. What do you want?

27:17.766 --> 27:19.420
To confirm that
I'm picking up the girls

27:19.463 --> 27:20.639
from karate tomorrow.
What's with you?

27:20.682 --> 27:22.292
I was hoping
it was someone else.

27:22.336 --> 27:23.946
NARRATOR: He's been getting
a lot of that lately.

27:23.990 --> 27:25.208
PETRA:
What's this number, anyway?

27:25.252 --> 27:27.994
I don't recognize it.It's my work number.

27:28.037 --> 27:30.257
Maybe you could save it
so that the next time I call,

27:30.300 --> 27:31.911
you're not so disappointed
I'm not someone else.

27:31.954 --> 27:34.174
You're not the only one
having a rough week, you know.

27:34.217 --> 27:36.132
Oh, right. Sorry.

27:36.176 --> 27:40.354
But also, you're welcome
because your problem is solved.

27:40.397 --> 27:42.704
What do you mean?Jane and I talked,

27:42.748 --> 27:45.315
and after, she mailed
those divorce papers.

27:45.359 --> 27:47.535
Really?LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oof.

27:47.578 --> 27:49.145
Yes, really.

27:49.189 --> 27:51.800
Wow. Th-Thank you, Petra.

27:51.844 --> 27:54.673
No problem. I got to go.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.981
Jane, where are you?
J.R. texted me back.

27:59.025 --> 28:01.027
She said she'll see me
tonight at 6:00.

28:01.070 --> 28:02.985
I need to make the play
of a lifetime.

28:05.031 --> 28:06.597
What are you
looking at, Parrot?

28:06.641 --> 28:09.383
I don't pay you to loiter.
Go squawk at the children.

28:10.863 --> 28:12.778
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I told you letting her

28:12.821 --> 28:14.780
stay around was a bad idea.

28:14.823 --> 28:17.696
Move it, Lady Bird.
Coming through.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.132
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Since we've been talking

28:19.175 --> 28:21.047
about worst nightmares,
I just need to stop here

28:21.090 --> 28:22.744
for a moment
to show you Pammy's.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.093
Trust me, it's worth it.

28:27.009 --> 28:28.924
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Okay. Back to our story.

28:28.968 --> 28:33.494
What's going on? Don't we have
to leave to Grandparents' Day?

28:33.537 --> 28:35.322
Mateo's getting dressed,
so I just thought

28:35.365 --> 28:36.758
we'd have a little
toast first.

28:36.802 --> 28:38.325
Does this mean
you sold the house?

28:38.368 --> 28:41.328
Not yet, but
I talked to Petra,

28:41.371 --> 28:44.984
and I am so happy that you
sent in the divorce papers.

28:45.027 --> 28:47.551
Just wanted
to celebrate.

28:47.595 --> 28:50.424
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know.
It's painful for me, too,

28:50.467 --> 28:53.993
but I vowed to tell things
mostly exactly as they are.

28:54.036 --> 28:56.909
What's wrong?I did mail the papers,

28:56.952 --> 28:58.824
but I was drunk when I did it,

28:58.867 --> 29:00.739
and I didn't want to make
a life-altering decision

29:00.782 --> 29:03.350
like that, so I got them back.

29:05.526 --> 29:07.223
I'm ready for
Grandparents' Day!

29:07.267 --> 29:11.662
Oh, you look so
handsome, buddy.

29:11.706 --> 29:13.708
You should
go get dressed.

29:15.623 --> 29:17.581
Jane. Me again.
I'm going over to J.R.'s.

29:17.625 --> 29:19.366
Look, if you think
of an inspiring, romantic,

29:19.409 --> 29:21.411
"winning my ex-girlfriend back"
speech in the next 15 minutes,

29:21.455 --> 29:23.065
call me.

29:23.109 --> 29:25.067
Also, I could use a second
opinion on my accessories.

29:25.111 --> 29:28.027
I was torn between bangles
and a statement necklace.

29:31.247 --> 29:34.598
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, that
accessory definitely clashes.

29:34.642 --> 29:35.991
What the hell are you doing?

29:36.035 --> 29:38.733
You have important date
with lady love.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.910
Give me 50 grand
and I give you the key.

29:41.954 --> 29:43.999
I'd rather cut my own arm off.

29:44.043 --> 29:46.045
Then cancel hot date.

29:46.088 --> 29:49.222
We have nice
family dinner instead.

29:49.265 --> 29:51.093
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Happy Grandparents' Day.

30:00.450 --> 30:01.712
Are you okay?

30:01.756 --> 30:03.236
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Did she kill Magda?

30:03.279 --> 30:05.238
Or chop off her arm?

30:05.281 --> 30:07.066
Sorry, just had a little trouble
getting here because...

30:07.109 --> 30:09.372
Well...

30:10.765 --> 30:12.854
Look, I've got
baggage...

30:12.898 --> 30:16.075
Mother, stop it!I cannot control gas.

30:16.118 --> 30:18.207
Look, this is not how
this was supposed to go.

30:18.251 --> 30:22.429
I came here to say that I meant
every word I wrote in that text,

30:22.472 --> 30:24.083
and I swear to you,
here and now,

30:24.126 --> 30:25.780
that I will never
lie to you again.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.173
I find that
hard to believe.

30:27.216 --> 30:29.262
Mother, stay out of this!Have you told Miss J.R.

30:29.305 --> 30:31.177
how you faked disability?

30:31.220 --> 30:33.396
Okay.

30:33.440 --> 30:36.922
Yes, I did pretend
to be blind

30:36.965 --> 30:38.619
to make more money
busking in Prague.

30:38.662 --> 30:40.099
She also cheated on husband.

30:40.142 --> 30:44.059
It's true, I was unfaithful
to Rafael.

30:44.103 --> 30:45.278
While he had cancer.

30:46.148 --> 30:48.194
Not my finest hour.

30:48.237 --> 30:49.630
Petra is a brunette.

30:51.501 --> 30:52.633
That I know.

30:53.982 --> 30:56.115
J.R., I mean it,

30:56.158 --> 31:00.641
I will never lie
to you again, ever.

31:00.684 --> 31:01.816
I love you.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.470
And I used to think

31:03.513 --> 31:07.169
my worst nightmare
was turning into my mother;

31:07.213 --> 31:10.999
now I know it's living
without you.

31:11.043 --> 31:12.522
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Aw.

31:12.566 --> 31:14.960
And Jane didn't even
have to write that for her.

31:15.003 --> 31:17.527
I've missed you every day
since we broke up.

31:21.705 --> 31:24.230
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And from one awkward trio

31:24.273 --> 31:26.667
to another.

31:26.710 --> 31:30.236
Hey, Rafael...

31:30.279 --> 31:32.194
I'm sorry.
I-I just...

31:32.238 --> 31:34.631
Now really isn't the time, Jane.

31:38.548 --> 31:40.942
Wow, Mom!

31:40.986 --> 31:42.552
Like the new wig?

31:42.596 --> 31:43.771
Ooh...

31:43.814 --> 31:45.033
You look beautiful, Xo.

31:45.077 --> 31:46.687
You should see your grandma.

31:46.730 --> 31:47.775
So much for keeping

31:47.818 --> 31:48.863
her feelings in check.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.909
ROGELIO:
My glam team did her up.

31:50.952 --> 31:52.867
Jorge's not gonna know
what hit him.
Oh...

31:52.911 --> 31:54.782
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
True, for the record.

31:54.825 --> 31:57.437
See? Alba looks fine.

32:09.666 --> 32:11.625
Wait.

32:11.668 --> 32:13.192
Does Jorge have feelings
for Alba?

32:13.235 --> 32:15.368
Or not?

32:34.300 --> 32:36.476
I guess... not.

32:40.871 --> 32:42.917
Oh...

32:54.842 --> 32:56.496
I thought you were waiting
for Jorge.

33:02.110 --> 33:05.461
Oh, no. You okay?

33:15.819 --> 33:16.995
Abuela!

33:17.038 --> 33:18.997
No. No, no, no, no...

33:35.665 --> 33:39.800
EMCEE:
Friends, I've just gotten word
we have a surprise performance.

33:53.292 --> 33:55.294
JANE :
Yes. That's my boy!

33:55.337 --> 33:56.991
And my mama.

33:57.035 --> 34:00.647
♪ You bring me joy

34:00.690 --> 34:03.476
♪ You bring me
joy ♪

34:03.519 --> 34:05.260
♪ More than I've ever felt

34:05.304 --> 34:08.524
♪ More than
I've ever felt ♪

34:08.568 --> 34:12.050
♪ You bring me joy

34:12.093 --> 34:15.183
♪ You bring me
joy ♪

34:15.227 --> 34:17.490
♪ More than I've ever felt.

34:19.057 --> 34:21.581
We did it!
We surprised everyone!

34:33.680 --> 34:36.770
Hey. It's Grandparents' Day,
not Grandmother's Day,

34:36.813 --> 34:38.685
so may I
have this dance?You okay?

34:38.728 --> 34:40.382
We need to go.

34:51.654 --> 34:52.612
Oh, Mom!

34:52.655 --> 34:53.656
Oh, my God!

34:53.700 --> 34:56.311
Oh, no. No.

35:01.186 --> 35:02.535
So, I want to keep
you overnight

35:02.578 --> 35:04.145
to make sure that
you're fully hydrated,

35:04.189 --> 35:06.104
but your vitals look good.
You just overexerted yourself.

35:06.147 --> 35:07.148
You're fine.

35:07.192 --> 35:10.064
Thank you very much, Doctor.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.587
Mm-hmm.

35:14.155 --> 35:15.809
I'm gonna get you
some more ice chips.

35:26.167 --> 35:28.430
Hi.

35:28.474 --> 35:29.779
How's your mom?

35:29.823 --> 35:34.088
She's a little dehydrated,
but she'll be fine.

35:34.132 --> 35:37.047
Well, I, um, I brought
her some comfy clothes

35:37.091 --> 35:38.962
and a coffee
for your dad.

35:39.006 --> 35:40.964
And I put Mateo down at Alba's.

35:41.008 --> 35:42.966
Jorge's watching him.

35:43.010 --> 35:47.884
And I can take your grandma home
so you can stay a little longer.

35:47.928 --> 35:50.974
Thank you.

35:51.018 --> 35:53.716
Of course.

35:53.760 --> 35:54.935
Hey, come here.

35:57.764 --> 35:59.809
Hey. Shh. It's okay.

35:59.853 --> 36:01.724
She's okay.

36:01.768 --> 36:05.119
Nothing my mother does
is okay.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.252
But she's not
gonna change.

36:07.295 --> 36:09.341
I know.

36:09.384 --> 36:13.910
But we'll figure out how to
deal with her. Together.

36:18.001 --> 36:19.307
Cut it off.

36:24.660 --> 36:27.707
You better have good aim.
This is my only good hand.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.839
You shouldn't have
lost the key, Mother.

36:29.883 --> 36:31.189
Do it with your eyes closed.

36:33.582 --> 36:36.368
MAGDA: Ah!

36:44.245 --> 36:46.813
I know, that would be...So weird.

36:46.856 --> 36:48.510
Oh. You're still here.

36:48.554 --> 36:50.251
I decided to stick around
a little longer.

36:50.295 --> 36:52.079
Hope that's okay.

36:52.122 --> 36:54.560
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It should
be noted that in that moment,

36:54.603 --> 36:56.214
Petra thought of
her friend Jane

36:56.257 --> 36:59.347
and knew she needed to give her a heads-up.

36:59.391 --> 37:03.264
But alas,
she had other priorities.

37:05.353 --> 37:07.747
Yeah, okay.

37:29.551 --> 37:32.162
ROGELIO: Now what?

37:32.206 --> 37:35.253
Do you need anything else?

37:35.296 --> 37:36.645
No.

37:36.689 --> 37:39.387
And you really don't need
to sleep here.

37:39.431 --> 37:41.389
If you're spending the
night in the hospital,

37:41.433 --> 37:42.651
so am I.

37:42.695 --> 37:46.176
Look, I know you're
mentally ready

37:46.220 --> 37:49.745
to put chemo behind you
and get on with your life,

37:49.789 --> 37:53.271
but you should wait until
your body is ready, too.

37:53.314 --> 37:55.751
That's not why
I pushed myself so hard.

37:55.795 --> 37:58.885
The chemo might not work.

37:58.928 --> 38:01.148
And if something happens to me,

38:01.191 --> 38:04.064
I don't want Mateo
to remember me like this.

38:04.107 --> 38:07.023
Sick and tired.

38:09.112 --> 38:13.073
I want Mateo to remember me
as the person I was before.

38:13.116 --> 38:15.336
Strong.

38:15.380 --> 38:18.078
And... vibrant.

38:18.121 --> 38:20.776
And fun.

38:20.820 --> 38:25.607
It's morbid,
I know, but...

38:25.651 --> 38:27.609
my mind goes there.

38:29.959 --> 38:32.092
I was going to show
you this later,

38:32.135 --> 38:35.965
when you were feeling better,
but now seems like a good time.

38:36.009 --> 38:38.272
After you left the dance,
they played a video

38:38.316 --> 38:41.188
of the kids speaking about
their grandparents.

38:41.231 --> 38:43.451
My abuelo
is a really famous actor

38:43.495 --> 38:46.106
and he's even better known
in Mexico.

38:46.149 --> 38:48.630
Oops, no, wrong part.

38:48.674 --> 38:51.154
Ah.You can't mess with my abuela

38:51.198 --> 38:52.808
'cause she's loud and tough.

38:52.852 --> 38:55.942
She'll yell at anyone.
Honestly, she doesn't even care,

38:55.985 --> 38:57.247
so be careful.

38:57.291 --> 38:59.206
And she also lets me eat, like,
so many cookies,

38:59.249 --> 39:01.643
like three in a row.

39:01.687 --> 39:05.212
I'd say that sounds like a
strong and vibrant person,

39:05.255 --> 39:06.822
wouldn't you?

39:09.303 --> 39:13.176
Please thank Jorge again
for watching Mateo.

39:37.462 --> 39:39.333
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends,

39:39.377 --> 39:40.595
that's when it happened.

39:40.639 --> 39:42.597
I'm in love with both of you.

39:42.641 --> 39:44.382
In that very moment,

39:44.425 --> 39:47.733
Rafael's memories
came flooding back, too.

39:47.776 --> 39:49.387
She fell asleep by the time
I was done. I snuck out.

39:49.430 --> 39:51.171
RAFAEL: Don't tell me
you're choosing Michael.

39:51.214 --> 39:53.434
Tell me anything but
do not tell me that.

39:53.478 --> 39:54.609
JANE:
Stop! Michael, stop!

39:55.915 --> 39:57.569
Stop! No!

39:57.612 --> 39:59.353
He still loves me.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.833
And I still love him.

40:14.150 --> 40:16.414
Go get ready for bed.
I'll be there in a minute.

40:16.457 --> 40:18.633
Good night,
Mr. Sweetface.

40:24.334 --> 40:25.684
How's your mom?

40:25.727 --> 40:28.904
She was feeling much better
when I left.

40:28.948 --> 40:32.212
I'm glad.Thank you,

40:32.255 --> 40:34.214
for everything
you did for me tonight.

40:34.257 --> 40:35.433
Even though...

40:35.476 --> 40:37.173
Do you still love him?

40:39.524 --> 40:44.311
I don't know.

40:46.182 --> 40:48.097
That feels like an answer.

40:50.012 --> 40:53.973
You know, I got my memories
back, too, Jane.

40:54.016 --> 40:55.931
You know what I remember?

40:57.890 --> 41:00.719
Waiting for you to pick Michael

41:00.762 --> 41:03.025
almost killed me.

41:08.640 --> 41:10.468
I need you to leave.

41:10.511 --> 41:14.472
P... Permanently?

41:14.515 --> 41:16.474
I don't know.

41:16.517 --> 41:17.605
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends,

41:17.649 --> 41:19.912
that, too, felt like an answer.

41:19.955 --> 41:21.479
MATEO:
I don't want to leave!

41:21.522 --> 41:22.958
I want to stay here with Daddy.

41:23.002 --> 41:27.615
Hey, you don't have to
go anywhere. Okay?

41:31.010 --> 41:33.578
I got this.

41:33.621 --> 41:35.449
You should go.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.807
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends,

41:45.851 --> 41:49.855
it was in this moment that
Jane realized that this...

41:51.857 --> 41:54.337
...was her worst nightmare.
