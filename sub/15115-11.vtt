00:01.401 --> 00:02.683
MICHELLE, PRINCE CHARMING'S
HERE FOR YOU.

00:02.683 --> 00:04.044
‐ MARRY ME.
‐ OH, HUBBELL.

00:04.044 --> 00:06.687
<i>I LIVE IN THIS BEAUTIFUL</i>
<i>TOWN CALLED PARADISE.</i>

00:06.687 --> 00:08.088
‐ WHO'S THIS?
‐ WAIT, YOU LIVE
WITH YOUR MOTHER?

00:08.088 --> 00:09.409
TELL ME, EVERYTHING.

00:09.409 --> 00:11.291
<i>SHE HAS A DANCE STUDIO.</i>
<i>HER WHOLE LIFE IS HERE.</i>

00:11.291 --> 00:12.292
WHO ARE YOU?

00:12.292 --> 00:13.453
SHE IS MY
DAUGHTER‐IN‐LAW.

00:13.453 --> 00:14.655
HUBBELL WAS IN
A CAR ACCIDENT.

00:14.655 --> 00:15.856
OH MY GOD,
HE'S DEAD?

00:15.856 --> 00:17.097
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I TOLD YOU

00:17.097 --> 00:18.178
MY PRODUCTION
OF THE NUTCRACKER

00:18.178 --> 00:19.459
<i>IS THE HIGHLIGHT</i>
<i>OF MY YEAR?</i>

00:19.459 --> 00:20.941
AIR CONDITIONING'S
NOT WORKING.

00:20.941 --> 00:22.543
‐ MUST SMELL GREAT.
WHO NEEDS A SPRAY?
‐ I DO.

00:22.543 --> 00:24.825
( screaming )

00:24.825 --> 00:25.866
WHAT? WHAT THE‐‐

00:25.866 --> 00:26.867
AAH!

00:26.867 --> 00:28.468
I MACED YOU!

00:28.468 --> 00:29.510
Boo: <i>WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!</i>

00:29.510 --> 00:30.711
Michelle: <i>IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.</i>

00:30.711 --> 00:33.073
‐ I'M ROMAN.
‐ SO, WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR?

00:33.073 --> 00:35.075
MOSH PIT GOT
A LITTLE TOO INTENSE.

00:35.075 --> 00:36.356
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

00:36.356 --> 00:37.678
MY BALLET TEACHER
MACED US

00:37.678 --> 00:38.839
DURING A PRODUCTION
OF THE NUTCRACKER.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.160
WOW.

00:40.160 --> 00:41.321
I'LL BE LUCKY
IF THESE PARENTS

00:41.321 --> 00:42.843
DON'T DRAG ME INTO COURT
AND HAVE ME FLOGGED.

00:42.843 --> 00:45.285
<i>THAT WOMAN IS NEVER</i>
<i>AROUND OUR CHILDREN EVER AGAIN!</i>

00:45.285 --> 00:47.127
OH CAPTAIN,
MY CAPTAIN.

00:47.127 --> 00:48.729
OH CAPTAIN,
MY CAPTAIN.

00:48.729 --> 00:49.850
YOU KNOW AT THE END
OF THE MOVIE

00:49.850 --> 00:52.132
THE GUY HAD TO LEAVE
ANYHOW, RIGHT?

00:53.213 --> 00:54.374
THANK YOU.

WHOA!

02:58.579 --> 03:00.981
WHOA!

03:00.981 --> 03:02.983

03:02.983 --> 03:04.985
WHOO! YAY.

Wait, seriously,

Edgar, Edgar!

03:18.478 --> 03:21.481
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

03:39.019 --> 03:41.221
Michelle: <i>Seriously.</i>
<i>I don't know if I can get up.</i>

03:41.221 --> 03:43.223
Truly: <i>FANNY?</i>

03:43.223 --> 03:45.626
<i>FANNY?</i>
<i>ARE YOU HERE?</i>

03:45.626 --> 03:47.027
<i>ARE YOU HOME?</i>
<i>ARE YOU UP?</i>

03:47.027 --> 03:49.229
<i>( crashing )</i>

03:49.229 --> 03:51.031
TRULY, ARE YOU BLEEDING?

03:51.031 --> 03:52.873
<i>NO... YES.</i>

03:52.873 --> 03:55.475
‐ DON'T MOVE, PLEASE.
‐ <i>OKAY. OW.</i>

03:55.475 --> 03:58.238
‐ DON'T MOVE, PLEASE.
‐ <i>OKAY. OW.</i>

03:58.238 --> 04:00.240
TRULY!

04:00.240 --> 04:03.243
‐ STAY STILL.
‐ I'M SORRY.
I'M REALLY EXCITED.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.965
I CAN SEE THAT.

04:04.965 --> 04:07.247
I'VE BEEN OBSESSING
OVER THE DESIGN FOR
THIS KITCHEN.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.248
I KNOW YOU WANT
SOMETHING NEW,

04:08.248 --> 04:09.409
BUT YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT.

04:09.409 --> 04:11.051
‐ UH‐HUH.
‐ AND LAST NIGHT,

04:11.051 --> 04:12.813
I HAD A DREAM.

04:12.813 --> 04:14.655
‐ WERE THERE GERBILS?
‐ THERE WERE GERBILS.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.657
BUT THIS TIME,
THEY DID NOT
MAKE ME DANCE.

04:16.657 --> 04:19.059
INSTEAD, THEY LED ME
DOWN A HALLWAY

04:19.059 --> 04:20.420
AND INTO
A KITCHEN.

04:20.420 --> 04:22.262
A REALLY GREAT KITCHEN.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.904
COME WITH ME.

04:23.904 --> 04:25.265
WHERE ARE
YOU GOING?

04:25.265 --> 04:26.667
TRULY?

04:28.108 --> 04:29.990
OKAY, SO AFTER THE GERBILS,

04:29.990 --> 04:32.352
I GOT UP AND I TRIED
TO PUT IT TOGETHER

04:32.352 --> 04:34.515
WITH PAINT SAMPLES
AND TILE SAMPLES

04:34.515 --> 04:35.996
AND PICTURES
OF APPLIANCES,

04:35.996 --> 04:38.759
BUT I JUST COULDN'T TRANSLATE
THE PICTURE IN MY HEAD.

04:38.759 --> 04:41.081
I NEED YOU TO SEE
WHAT'S IN MY HEAD.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.086
WELCOME TO MY HEAD.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.088
‐ WHAT ON EARTH?
‐ IT'S YOUR KITCHEN.

04:48.088 --> 04:50.090
DOWN TO THE LAST
TINY DETAILS.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.092
YOU BUILT
A CARDBOARD KITCHEN?

04:52.092 --> 04:54.094
YEAH. ORIGINALLY,
I WAS JUST GONNA DO ONE WALL,

04:54.094 --> 04:55.455
BUT I COULDN'T
DECIDE WHICH WALL,

04:55.455 --> 04:57.297
SO THEN I FIGURED, "WHY NOT
JUST BUILD THE WHOLE THING

04:57.297 --> 04:58.458
SO YOU CAN
STAND IN IT?"

04:58.458 --> 04:59.860
I CAN'T STAND IN IT.

04:59.860 --> 05:02.462
OKAY, SO I REDID
YOUR WHOLE WORK TRIANGLE.

05:02.462 --> 05:04.464
I MOVED THE FRIDGE
OVER HERE. MUCH BETTER.

05:04.464 --> 05:05.866
SINK AND STOVE
OVER THERE.

05:05.866 --> 05:06.947
OH, LOOK.

05:06.947 --> 05:08.468
FOR PASTA WATER.

05:08.468 --> 05:09.950
COOL, RIGHT?
IT'S THE NEW BIG THING.

05:09.950 --> 05:11.552
OH, AND A WOK.
REMEMBER HOW
I ALWAYS SAID

05:11.552 --> 05:13.634
‐ YOU WANTED A WOK?
‐ NO.

05:13.634 --> 05:14.635
WELL, NOW YOU
HAVE A WOK.

05:14.635 --> 05:16.196
I GAVE YOU
A WALL OF SPICES,

05:16.196 --> 05:17.477
WEATHERED MARBLE
FOR THE COUNTERTOPS,

05:17.477 --> 05:19.319
AND I FOUND THIS REALLY
GREAT PAINT TREATMENT IDEA

05:19.319 --> 05:21.321
OUT OF A BOOK
OF CUBAN HOMES, SEE?

05:21.321 --> 05:23.564
TRULY, I CAN'T
SEE ANYTHING.

05:23.564 --> 05:24.965
GAH! WAIT, SORRY.

05:24.965 --> 05:26.126
HERE.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.407
BETTER?

05:27.407 --> 05:29.129
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO PUT A LABEL

05:29.129 --> 05:31.211
ON EXACTLY WHAT
THE STYLE IS.

05:31.211 --> 05:34.494
I THINK IT'S KIND OF
A GREENWICH VILLAGE
1950s COFFEE HOUSE

05:34.494 --> 05:36.056
LITERARY COMMUNIST
COLLECTIVE.

05:36.056 --> 05:38.739
SEE THE HAROLD CLURMAN
AND LENIN PORTRAITS
OVER THE SINK?

05:38.739 --> 05:41.542
YOU WIRED A CARDBOARD BOX
FOR ELECTRICITY?

05:41.542 --> 05:43.143
I KNOW. SO WHAT
DO YOU THINK?

05:43.143 --> 05:45.345
I THINK IT'S THE MOST
DISTURBING THING
YOU'VE EVER DONE.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.147
NO.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.229
NOT BY A LONG SHOT.

05:49.229 --> 05:50.350
( sighs )

05:50.350 --> 05:52.352
I MAY NEVER
WALK UPRIGHT AGAIN.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.914
‐ DO YOU HATE IT?
‐ I DO NOT HATE IT.

05:53.914 --> 05:55.516
‐ ARE YOU GONNA DO IT?
‐ I DON'T KNOW.

05:55.516 --> 05:57.157
WELL, WHAT DIDN'T YOU LIKE?
I CAN FIX IT.

05:57.157 --> 05:58.599
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I LIKE.

05:58.599 --> 06:00.080
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO WITH THE KITCHEN.

06:00.080 --> 06:01.922
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO WITH THE LIVING ROOM.

06:01.922 --> 06:04.164
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO WITH MY LIFE.

06:04.164 --> 06:05.926
THIS HAS BEEN SUCH
A TERRIBLE YEAR.

06:05.926 --> 06:08.529
I JUST FEEL STUCK.
MY CHI IS COMPLETELY
STAGNANT.

06:08.529 --> 06:09.770
WELL, WHAT
CAN I DO?

06:09.770 --> 06:11.171
I DON'T KNOW.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.613
I JUST FEEL LIKE
EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE

06:12.613 --> 06:14.174
NEEDS TO CHANGE.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.616
I'M SORRY.

06:15.616 --> 06:17.177
‐ OH.
‐ OH.

06:21.181 --> 06:23.183
‐ TRULY?
‐ YES?

06:23.183 --> 06:26.386
HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN A BLONDE?

06:26.386 --> 06:28.549
TWO BEDROOMS,
ONE‐AND‐A‐HALF BATHS,

06:28.549 --> 06:30.270
AND A BONUS ROOM
OFF THE GARAGE.

06:30.270 --> 06:32.553
IGNORE THE FLOOR. A ROCK BAND
RENTED IT FOR A MONTH.

06:32.553 --> 06:33.794
AND THEY HAD
A LOT OF PARROTS.

06:33.794 --> 06:34.955
YOU'LL JUST
REPLACE THE CARPET.

06:34.955 --> 06:36.036
OR YOU'LL PUT
THE VENT THERE

06:36.036 --> 06:37.878
WHEN YOU INSTALL
THE NEW HEATING SYSTEM.

06:37.878 --> 06:39.880
‐ WHAT'S WRONG WITH
THE HEATING SYSTEM?
‐ THE FORMER OWNER TOOK IT.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.642
<i>HE TOOK</i>
<i>THE HEATING SYSTEM?</i>

06:41.642 --> 06:43.403
AND THE DOORKNOBS.
AND THE KITCHEN CUPBOARDS,

06:43.403 --> 06:45.285
SOME COPPER PIPING,
THE SHOWER HEADS,

06:45.285 --> 06:47.407
CURTAIN RODS,
ONE TOILET SEAT,
AND THE MAILBOX.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.329
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?
WAS HE CRAZY?

06:49.329 --> 06:51.411
THIS HAPPENS A LOT
IN FORECLOSURES.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.653
BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

06:52.653 --> 06:55.415
THAT IS WHY THIS BABY
IS PRICED TO SELL.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.217
SEEMS LIKE
A LOT OF WORK.

06:57.217 --> 06:59.419
EXCUSE ME,
MARA, IS IT?

06:59.419 --> 07:03.824
MARA, WHAT YOU HAVE HERE
IS WHAT WE IN THE BIZ CALL

07:03.824 --> 07:05.425
A BLANK PALETTE.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.427
YOU CAN MAKE IT INTO
WHATEVER YOU WANT IT
TO BE.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.429
YOU COULD KNOCK OUT THAT WALL,
OPEN THE KITCHEN OUT

07:09.429 --> 07:11.151
TO THE LIVING AREA.
YOU HAVE KIDS?

07:11.151 --> 07:12.432
‐ TWO.
‐ DARLING.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.234
WELL, THE SCHOOLS
IN THIS AREA

07:14.234 --> 07:15.435
ARE THE BEST
IN THE COUNTY.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.438
AND THIS STREET IS THE MOST
DESIRABLE STREET IN TOWN.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.520
AND YOU KNOW,
IT'S ALWAYS BETTER

07:19.520 --> 07:21.682
TO HAVE THE CRAPPIEST HOUSE
ON THE BEST STREET,

07:21.682 --> 07:22.843
AND TAKE
MY WORD FOR IT,

07:22.843 --> 07:25.766
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY
THE CRAPPIEST HOUSE THERE IS.

07:25.766 --> 07:27.087
HOW'S THE KITCHEN?

07:27.087 --> 07:31.091
JUST NEEDS
A LITTLE LOVE, MARA.

07:31.091 --> 07:33.534
ADDRESS, CELL,
AND E‐MAIL WOULD BE SUPER.

07:33.534 --> 07:35.455
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS,
I'M GINNY.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.858
CUT IT SMALLER.
IT HAS TO LAST TILL 4:00.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.459
HELP YOURSELF
TO A SANDWICH.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.461
<i>( phone beeps )</i>

07:41.461 --> 07:43.263

07:43.263 --> 07:44.304
HEY.

07:44.304 --> 07:46.026
HEY, GINNY.
CAN'T TALK.

07:46.026 --> 07:47.508
STOP RUNNING!

07:47.508 --> 07:48.629
YOU'RE BABYSITTING?

07:48.629 --> 07:49.630
<i>For the rest</i>
<i>of my life.</i>

07:49.630 --> 07:50.631
WHAT?

07:50.631 --> 07:51.792
MY MOM CAME HOME TODAY

07:51.792 --> 07:53.473
AND ANNOUNCED
SHE'S PREGNANT.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.475
‐ EW!
‐ <i>I know.</i>

07:55.475 --> 07:58.038
‐ UGH! WHY?
‐ I DON'T KNOW.

07:58.038 --> 07:59.800
I THOUGHT WE WERE
PAST ALL THAT.

07:59.800 --> 08:00.961
OH GOD.

08:00.961 --> 08:02.042
SO SO SORRY.

08:02.042 --> 08:03.283
MY DAD'S IN A PANIC.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.645
HE CAME HOME TODAY
AND CANCELED

08:04.645 --> 08:05.926
ALL THE MOVIE CHANNELS.
<i>( screaming )</i>

08:05.926 --> 08:08.128
GOD, DID SHE
HAVE IT ALREADY?

08:08.128 --> 08:10.290
THAT IS MY BROTHER'S
PLAY GROUP.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.573
IT IS MY MOTHER'S DAY
TO TAKE THEM WHICH MEANS

08:12.573 --> 08:14.374
IT IS NOW MY DAY
TO TAKE THEM.

08:14.374 --> 08:15.656
YOUR LIFE IS AWFUL.

08:15.656 --> 08:18.498
PLUS MY MOM HAS TO BE
ON COMPLETE BED REST,

08:18.498 --> 08:19.740
STARTING NOW,

08:19.740 --> 08:21.582
WHICH MEANS I AM
IN CHARGE OF THE HOUSE,

08:21.582 --> 08:24.424
WHICH MEANS I HAVE TO CUT BACK
ON MY OYSTER BAR HOURS.

08:24.424 --> 08:25.586
BUMMER.

08:25.586 --> 08:26.827
I HAVE A COUPLE
OF POCKET LISTINGS

08:26.827 --> 08:28.068
IF THIS ONE DOESN'T
WORK FOR YOU.

08:28.068 --> 08:29.069
THANK YOU.

08:29.069 --> 08:30.310
WHATEVER.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.672
NO WAY YOU GUYS ARE
GETTING A LOAN ANYHOW.

08:31.672 --> 08:32.753
WHERE ARE YOU?

08:32.753 --> 08:34.074
MY MOTHER'S OPEN HOUSE.

08:34.074 --> 08:35.516
<i>Why?</i>

08:35.516 --> 08:37.518
BECAUSE, BOO,
MY FATHER FINALLY
SET THE WEDDING DATE

08:37.518 --> 08:39.520
WITH FAYE MENDELSON
AND MY MOTHER

08:39.520 --> 08:41.802
IS TAKING IT
VERY VERY WELL.

08:41.802 --> 08:43.323
OH, SORRY.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.925
SHE CAN'T BE AROUND PEOPLE
FOR LONGER THAN A MINUTE

08:44.925 --> 08:46.527
WITHOUT CRYING
OR SCREAMING.

08:46.527 --> 08:49.930
SO HERE I AM
WEARING THE BLAZER.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.331
OH, HEY,
BEFORE I FORGET,

08:51.331 --> 08:52.412
DID THE PACKAGE ARRIVE?

08:52.412 --> 08:54.535
IT DID. THERE WAS
A LITTLE PROBLEM

08:54.535 --> 08:55.856
AND I HAD TO
REROUTE IT.

08:55.856 --> 08:57.097
Nanette: <i>BOO?</i>

08:57.097 --> 08:58.539
HEY, I HAVE TO GO.
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

09:01.181 --> 09:02.543
DO YOU WANT PIZZAS?
I'M MAKING THEM.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.104
MMM. YES,
I DO WANT ONE.

09:04.104 --> 09:05.626
HEY, DO WE
HAVE A COOLER?

09:05.626 --> 09:07.347
I DON'T KNOW.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.829
I'LL HAVE TO LOOK.

09:08.829 --> 09:09.990
BECAUSE MY BED REST
TIP BOOK HERE SAYS

09:09.990 --> 09:11.191
YOU HAVE TO KEEP
A COOLER FILLED
WITH SNACKS

09:11.191 --> 09:12.633
AND DRINKS NEAR YOU
AT ALL TIMES

09:12.633 --> 09:13.794
SO YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GO TOO FAR.

09:13.794 --> 09:15.556
ISN'T THAT THE BEST THING
YOU'VE EVER HEARD?

09:15.556 --> 09:17.357
‐ ALMOST.
‐ I ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE

09:17.357 --> 09:18.879
TO PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES,
BRUSH MY HAIR,

09:18.879 --> 09:19.960
AND PUT ON LIPSTICK
EVERY DAY

09:19.960 --> 09:21.562
WHICH IS HILARIOUS
SINCE I DO NONE

09:21.562 --> 09:23.363
OF THOSE THINGS NOW.

09:23.363 --> 09:24.885
OH, I'M SO EXCITED.

09:24.885 --> 09:25.966
BED REST.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.367
I'M GONNA BE
ON BED REST.

09:27.367 --> 09:28.569
FOR MONTHS I'M
GOING TO SLEEP LATE

09:28.569 --> 09:29.970
AND LOUNGE AROUND.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.371
I'M GONNA WATCH MOVIES,

09:31.371 --> 09:32.653
AND TELEVISION.

09:32.653 --> 09:34.454
I'M FINALLY GOING TO SEE
THE FINALLY OF "FRIENDS."

09:34.454 --> 09:35.576
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO THE FRIENDS ARE.

09:35.576 --> 09:36.977
ARE THEY FRIENDS
ANYMORE?

09:36.977 --> 09:38.378
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T TELL ME.

09:38.378 --> 09:39.580
I WILL FIND OUT
FOR MYSELF

09:39.580 --> 09:41.461
BECAUSE I AM ON,
SAY IT WITH ME‐‐

09:41.461 --> 09:42.823
‐ BED REST.
‐ BED REST.

09:42.823 --> 09:44.665
‐ YAY!
‐ YAY.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.668
( sighs )

09:47.668 --> 09:49.870
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

09:49.870 --> 09:51.592
HEY.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.233
Boo: <i>Hey, I just wanted</i>
<i>to make sure‐‐</i>

09:53.233 --> 09:55.996
HOLD ON.
YES, JEFF?

09:55.996 --> 09:57.598
YOU TWO GONNA
ORDER ANYTHING?

09:57.598 --> 09:59.760
YEAH, COULD I GET
A SPOON FOR THIS PUDDING

09:59.760 --> 10:01.321
AND SOME WATER,
NO ICE.

10:01.321 --> 10:02.643
AND THEN?

10:02.643 --> 10:03.764
LET'S SEE HOW
THAT GOES FIRST.

10:03.764 --> 10:05.766
TWO AND A HALF HOURS.

10:05.766 --> 10:07.608
YOU'VE BEEN SITTING HERE
FOR TWO AND A HALF HOURS.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.409
YOU'VE ORDERED ONE COFFEE,
ONE ROOT BEER,

10:09.409 --> 10:10.611
A BLT THAT
YOU SENT BACK‐‐

10:10.611 --> 10:11.692
WE FORGOT HIS TEETH.

10:11.692 --> 10:12.773
YOU'RE TAKING UP
THREE TABLES

10:12.773 --> 10:13.934
THAT PAYING CUSTOMERS
WHO ORDER FOOD

10:13.934 --> 10:14.975
AND PAY TIPS
COULD BE USING.

10:14.975 --> 10:16.456
NO ONE'S HERE, JEFFREY.

10:16.456 --> 10:17.497
AND EVERY DAY
YOU COME BACK IN HERE

10:17.497 --> 10:18.619
AND TAKE UP THE SAME
THREE TABLES.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.300
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY,
DRAMA QUEEN.

10:20.300 --> 10:22.022
PEOPLE WALK BY AND SEE
AN OLD MAN IN A WHEEL CHAIR

10:22.022 --> 10:23.463
AND THINK THIS IS
A NURSING HOME.

10:23.463 --> 10:25.425
PEOPLE WALK BY AND SEE
A "GRADE PENDING" SIGN

10:25.425 --> 10:27.828
IN THE WINDOW,
AND THINK THIS IS
A GORDON RAMSAY SHOW.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.630
WE HAVE A "B."
GOT IT YESTERDAY.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.512
CONGRATULATIONS.
I'M ON THE PHONE.

10:31.512 --> 10:33.193
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.
GO TO DENNY'S.

10:33.193 --> 10:36.036
LOOK, MY GRANDPA'S LIFE
IS IN A WHEELCHAIR, OKAY?

10:36.036 --> 10:37.197
AND I TRY TO
MAKE THAT LIFE

10:37.197 --> 10:38.719
AS PLEASANT AS POSSIBLE,
WHICH MEANS

10:38.719 --> 10:40.801
WHATEVER HE WANTS TO DO,
WE DO.

10:40.801 --> 10:41.962
AND HE WANTS
TO COME HERE.

10:41.962 --> 10:43.884
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
BUT HE DOES.

10:43.884 --> 10:46.767
SO I'M GOING TO BRING HIM HERE
AS LONG AS HE WANTS.

10:46.767 --> 10:49.049
NOW GO GET US
THAT WATER.

10:51.051 --> 10:53.053
‐ HEY!
‐ WE SELL PUDDING.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.214
BUY IT.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.819
SORRY,
JEFF'S OVULATING.

10:58.819 --> 11:01.421
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
THE PACKAGE GOT THERE OKAY.

11:01.421 --> 11:03.784
YES. IT ARRIVED.
IT'S FINE.

11:03.784 --> 11:05.065
OKAY. GOOD.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.667
GOT TO GO.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.749
I'M NEVER
HAVING CHILDREN.

11:08.749 --> 11:10.671
PREACHING TO
THE CHOIR.

11:11.992 --> 11:14.434
WATER, NO ICE.
DO NOT THINK OF
ASKING FOR STRAWS.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.758
‐ DON'T YOU DANCE?
‐ WHAT?

11:17.758 --> 11:19.239
BALLET?
WHY AREN'T YOU IN CLASS?

11:19.239 --> 11:20.240
ISN'T THAT
WHAT YOU DO?

11:20.240 --> 11:22.683
YEAH, WELL...

11:22.683 --> 11:24.685
THINGS AREN'T REALLY
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

11:26.486 --> 11:27.848
( sighs )

11:31.772 --> 11:33.854
IF WE CAN PICK
A FOCAL POINT,

11:33.854 --> 11:35.696
IT MIGHT HELP
THE WHOLE ROOM
COME INTO FOCUS.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.497
‐ UH‐HUH.
‐ IN LIECHTENSTEIN

11:37.497 --> 11:39.700
THERE'S A MANUFACTURER
OF GERMAN REFRIGERATORS

11:39.700 --> 11:41.101
THAT ARE REALLY
AMAZING LOOKING.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.183
NOBODY WILL HAVE
A FRIDGE LIKE THIS.

11:43.183 --> 11:45.265
DO YOU SEE A BOX
LABELED "TEA POTS"?

11:45.265 --> 11:46.707
WE WOULD JUST HAVE TO
CONVERT THE CURRENT

11:46.707 --> 11:48.428
FROM EUROPEAN
TO AMERICAN.

11:48.428 --> 11:49.870
AND THEY DON'T
DELIVER OR SHIP

11:49.870 --> 11:51.792
SO WE WOULD HAVE TO
GO TO GERMANY TO BUY IT,

11:51.792 --> 11:53.514
THEN TRAIN TO LIECHTENSTEIN
TO PICK IT UP

11:53.514 --> 11:54.835
AND DRIVE IT
BACK HOME.

11:54.835 --> 11:56.837
SOUNDS VERY
COMPLICATED.

11:56.837 --> 11:58.238
WELL YEAH,
BUT IT COMES IN PURPLE.

12:00.521 --> 12:03.804
THE STUDIO LOOKS
SO WEIRD LIKE THIS.

12:03.804 --> 12:06.807
WITH THE CHRISTMAS TREE UP
AND THE FIREPLACE

12:06.807 --> 12:08.729
AND THE POLICE TAPE.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.731
ALL DUSTY
AND FORGOTTEN.

12:10.731 --> 12:13.133
SCARY.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.536
LIKE IT'S HAUNTED.

12:15.536 --> 12:17.377
<i>HAUNTED BY THE GHOSTS</i>
<i>OF LITTLE GIRLS,</i>

12:17.377 --> 12:18.739
SCREAMING FROM
BEING MACED.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.821
WHY IS THERE
A CANOE IN HERE?

12:20.821 --> 12:22.743
ONE OF THE NEIGHBORS NEEDED
A PLACE TO STORE IT.

12:22.743 --> 12:26.026
NOTHING IS MORE TERRIFYING
THAN A CANOE.

12:27.387 --> 12:29.069
ALL RIGHT, TIME TO
GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

12:29.069 --> 12:30.310
BUT WHAT ABOUT
YOUR TEA POT?

12:30.310 --> 12:31.552
I'LL BUY
ANOTHER ONE.

12:31.552 --> 12:33.393
FANNY.

12:33.393 --> 12:34.915
WHEN DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL OPEN THE STUDIO

12:34.915 --> 12:35.756
BACK UP AGAIN?

12:39.159 --> 12:40.360
WHEN IT FEELS RIGHT.

13:36.176 --> 13:36.697
<i>WHOO.</i>

13:36.697 --> 13:39.139
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
TWO SHAKES OF STARDUST.

13:40.140 --> 13:42.142
<i>( music playing )</i>

14:12.172 --> 14:14.174
YOU WANNA SEE SOMETHING?

14:15.616 --> 14:16.657
<i>YEAH!</i>

14:16.657 --> 14:18.098
<i>( door opens )</i>

14:18.098 --> 14:19.179
HONEY, I'M HOME.

14:19.179 --> 14:20.340
WELL, I HOPE
YOU'RE HAPPY.

14:20.340 --> 14:21.261
THE ROAST IS BURNT,
AND NONE OF THE KIDS

14:21.261 --> 14:22.583
REMEMBER WHAT
YOU LOOK LIKE.

14:22.583 --> 14:23.744
RICK TOOK ME DANCING.

14:23.744 --> 14:25.345
‐ CLEOPATRA'S BARGE?
‐ YEP.

14:25.345 --> 14:27.508
‐ SO SAD.
‐ STOP. HE LIKES
CLEOPATRA'S BARGE.

14:27.508 --> 14:29.189
HE USED TO HANG THERE
WITH THE ACTUAL CLEOPATRA.

14:29.189 --> 14:32.352
HEY, HE'S THE REASON
I CAME HOME WITH THIS.

14:32.352 --> 14:33.874
WHERE IS GRANDPA
ANYHOW?

14:33.874 --> 14:35.115
HE WON'T PARK
ON THE STREET.

14:35.115 --> 14:36.517
THINKS HIS CAR
WILL GET BROKEN INTO.

14:36.517 --> 14:37.518
WITH AGE COMES WISDOM.

14:37.518 --> 14:39.039
HE'S NOT AS OLD
AS YOU THINK.

14:39.039 --> 14:40.040
I THINK HE
DISCOVERED FIRE.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.041
SEE? WRONG.

14:41.041 --> 14:42.122
I THINK HE HELD
THE COMMANDMENTS

14:42.122 --> 14:43.363
WHILE MOSES USED
THE LITTLE BOYS' ROOM.

14:43.363 --> 14:45.726
‐ WRONG AGAIN.
‐ I THINK HE VOTED FOR POLK.

14:45.726 --> 14:46.767
<i>HEY, RICK.</i>

14:46.767 --> 14:47.968
WE WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

14:47.968 --> 14:50.210
MICHELLE. MICHELLE,
MICHELLE MY BELLE.

14:50.210 --> 14:52.613
I HEAR YOU GUYS
WENT DANCING TONIGHT.

14:52.613 --> 14:54.775
WELL, WHEN
YOU ARE SQUIRING

14:54.775 --> 14:56.617
A LADY LIKE
THIS ONE AROUND,

14:56.617 --> 14:58.378
YOU HAVE TO KEEP
THE NIGHTS INTERESTING.

14:58.378 --> 15:00.300
‐ SQUIRING.
‐ STOP.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.702
I THINK HE WAS
IN THE CRUSADES.

15:01.702 --> 15:03.624
OH, YOU'RE NOT
HUNGRY TONIGHT.

15:03.624 --> 15:05.145
‐ TOO BAD.
‐ NO, I'M HUNGRY.

15:05.145 --> 15:06.707
I'M SUPER HUNGRY.
I'M HUNGRY AND SORRY

15:06.707 --> 15:08.228
AND HUNGRY.

15:08.228 --> 15:10.230
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE ALWAYS
WELCOME TO COME OUT WITH US.

15:10.230 --> 15:11.712
‐ YEAH.
‐ A PRETTY GIRL LIKE YOU

15:11.712 --> 15:14.394
SHOULD NOT BE SITTING
AROUND HERE EVERY NIGHT.

15:14.394 --> 15:16.236
I CAN FIX YOU UP
WITH A FRIEND OF MINE.

15:16.236 --> 15:18.318
THAT'D BE SWELL.
RIGHT, MICHELLE?

15:18.318 --> 15:19.640
IT WOULD BE EPIC.

15:19.640 --> 15:21.401
MY FRIEND GEORGIE GETS OUT
OF THE HOSPITAL FRIDAY.

15:21.401 --> 15:23.403
‐ HOSPITAL?
‐ <i>NOTHING SERIOUS.</i>

15:23.403 --> 15:25.085
YOU KNOW, A POLYP
HERE AND THERE.

15:25.085 --> 15:26.406
A COUPLE OF ZAPS,
HE'LL BE CHASING YOU

15:26.406 --> 15:28.288
AROUND THE DINNER TABLE
BY WEDNESDAY.

15:28.288 --> 15:29.650
WOW. I CAN'T WAIT.

15:29.650 --> 15:32.573
<i>WELL FINE THEN.</i>
<i>I WILL SET IT UP TOMORROW.</i>

15:32.573 --> 15:34.735
HONEY, COULD YOU BRING ME
A GLASS OF WATER

15:34.735 --> 15:35.816
AND A COUPLE OF THOSE‐‐

15:35.816 --> 15:37.257
‐ I WILL.
‐ THANK YOU, SWEETHEART.

15:37.257 --> 15:38.939
‐ VIAGRA?
‐ TUMS.

15:38.939 --> 15:41.101
GOODNIGHT, MICHELLE.

15:41.101 --> 15:43.664
MICHELLE, MICHELLE,
MY BELLE.

15:43.664 --> 15:44.825
GOODNIGHT, RICK.

15:44.825 --> 15:46.186
OH WAIT WAIT WAIT.
YOU'D KNOW THIS.

15:46.186 --> 15:47.668
JESUS, MARRIED
OR SINGLE?

15:47.668 --> 15:49.830
‐ WHAT?
‐ I'LL BE RIGHT IN, BABY.

15:49.830 --> 15:51.672
ALL RIGHT, DARLING.
GOODNIGHT.

15:51.672 --> 15:53.954
I AM ALWAYS NICE
TO YOUR BOYFRIENDS.

15:53.954 --> 15:56.517
MY BOYFRIENDS DON'T HAVE
AN AARP BUMPER STICKER
ON THEIR CAR.

15:56.517 --> 15:59.119
YOU MEAN ON THEIR
BRAND NEW JAGUAR?

15:59.119 --> 16:00.961
FINE, YOU WIN.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.683
AH, STEAK.
MY FAVORITE.

16:02.683 --> 16:04.284
THERE'S MAC AND CHEESE
IN THERE ALSO.

16:04.284 --> 16:06.286
YOU TAKE VERY GOOD
CARE OF ME.

16:06.286 --> 16:07.688
HOW WAS WORK?

16:07.688 --> 16:09.049
IT WAS MAGICAL.

16:09.049 --> 16:10.971
‐ AT LEAST YOU'RE DANCING.
‐ IN HENDERSON.

16:10.971 --> 16:12.693
HENDERSON'S NOT THAT
DIFFERENT FROM VEGAS.

16:12.693 --> 16:14.214
HENDERSON IS
ROB SCHNEIDER

16:14.214 --> 16:15.295
TO VEGAS'
DANIEL DAY LEWIS.

16:15.295 --> 16:16.376
IT'S A JOB.

16:16.376 --> 16:17.698
THE HOOKERS LOOK
SAD FOR ME.

16:17.698 --> 16:18.979
AND YOU DON'T KNOW PATHETIC
UNTIL YOU'VE BEEN

16:18.979 --> 16:20.300
PITIED BY
A HENDERSON HOOKER.

16:20.300 --> 16:22.462
ACTUALLY THERE ARE NO
OFFICIAL HENDERSON HOOKERS.

16:22.462 --> 16:24.304
THEY'RE JUST LAUGHLIN
HOOKERS PASSING THROUGH

16:24.304 --> 16:26.146
WHO STOPPED IN TO USE
THE BATHROOM AND THOUGHT

16:26.146 --> 16:27.147
"WELL, AS LONG
AS I'M HERE."

16:27.147 --> 16:28.308
I'M STILL WORKING
ON JANICE

16:28.308 --> 16:29.630
‐ TO TAKE YOU BACK.
‐ DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

16:29.630 --> 16:31.712
I'LL BE FINE.

16:31.712 --> 16:33.994
MMM. BOY,
THIS IS SO GOOD.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.475
YOU ARE NUTS
THAT YOU NEVER EAT

16:35.475 --> 16:36.316
ANY OF THIS
DELICIOUS FOOD

16:36.316 --> 16:38.158
GRANDPA WALTON
IS PLYING YOU WITH.

16:38.158 --> 16:39.479
IF I ATE
THE DELICIOUS FOOD

16:39.479 --> 16:40.561
HE WAS PLYING ME WITH,
HE WOULDN'T BE

16:40.561 --> 16:41.722
PLYING ME WITH IT ANYMORE.

16:41.722 --> 16:43.003
'CAUSE YOU'D BE
A BIG FAT LADY.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.244
HE LIKES ME IN
THE LITTLE TIGHT DRESSES

16:44.244 --> 16:45.405
WITH BIG HIGH HEELS.

16:45.405 --> 16:46.486
I DON'T KNOW.
I BET YOU COULD EAT

16:46.486 --> 16:48.408
ONCE IN A WHILE AND
"ON GOLDEN POND" IN THERE

16:48.408 --> 16:50.571
‐ WOULD STILL LOVE YOU.
‐ CAN'T RISK IT YET. TOO NEW.

16:50.571 --> 16:52.412
HEY, DO YOU WANT ME TO MAKE
MYSELF SCARCE TONIGHT?

16:52.412 --> 16:53.894
I COULD GO OUT BY THE POOL
WHILE YOU GET NAKED

16:53.894 --> 16:56.256
AND HAVE HIM EXPLAIN TO YOU
WHO THE MARX BROTHERS ARE AGAIN.

16:56.256 --> 16:57.337
THAT'S OKAY.
HE DRANK A MARTINI TONIGHT.

16:57.337 --> 16:59.179
‐ HE'S PROBABLY OUT.
‐ OH.

16:59.179 --> 17:00.340
BUT MAYBE TOMORROW.

17:00.340 --> 17:02.462
<i>WE'RE GONNA HAVE</i>
<i>A QUIET HOME EVENING.</i>

17:02.462 --> 17:04.505
OUR VERY FIRST
QUIET HOME EVENING.

17:04.505 --> 17:06.226
I MIGHT EVEN BAKE.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.387
DO YOU LIKE HIM?

17:07.387 --> 17:08.669
OF COURSE I LIKE HIM.

17:08.669 --> 17:12.312
NO, I MEAN, DO YOU
LIKE HIM LIKE HIM?

17:12.312 --> 17:14.755
NO.

17:14.755 --> 17:16.837
‐ WELL‐‐
‐ I'D MAKE YOUR MIND UP
A LITTLE FASTER

17:16.837 --> 17:18.198
IF I WERE YOU.
TIME'S A TICKIN'.

17:18.198 --> 17:19.760
‐ IS IT WEIRD IF I DO?
‐ YES.

17:19.760 --> 17:21.041
HE'S GENEROUS
AND FUNNY.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.362
HE LIKES MOVIES.
HE LIKES TO DANCE.

17:22.362 --> 17:24.364
HE'S ACTUALLY
IN VERY GOOD SHAPE.

17:24.364 --> 17:25.445
HE GOES TO THE GYM
EVERY DAY.

17:25.445 --> 17:26.527
HE CAN CARRY ME.

17:26.527 --> 17:28.529
THE IMPORTANT THING IS
CAN YOU CARRY HIM...

17:28.529 --> 17:29.610
‐ INTO THE E. R.?
‐ FORGET IT.

17:29.610 --> 17:31.772
'CAUSE THAT'S THE
MORE LIKELY SCENARIO.

17:31.772 --> 17:33.213
I SHOULD GET IN THERE.

17:33.213 --> 17:34.214
NIGHT.

17:36.777 --> 17:38.218
HOLD ON A SEC.

17:38.218 --> 17:39.379
FOR RENT.

17:39.379 --> 17:40.941
THANKS.

17:40.941 --> 17:43.303
I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HAPPY.

17:44.384 --> 17:45.866
THINGS WILL
GET BETTER.

17:56.316 --> 17:58.078
RED PILL EVERY
FOUR HOURS,

17:58.078 --> 17:59.319
BLUE PILL EVER
12 HOURS,

17:59.319 --> 18:00.961
AND THE GREEN PILL
AS NEEDED.

18:00.961 --> 18:02.563
BUT DON'T LET HIM
CON YOU WITH THOSE.

18:02.563 --> 18:04.725
HE LIKES TO TAKE EXTRA
AND WATCH THE MONEY HONEY.

18:04.725 --> 18:06.326
CALL IF YOU
NEED ANYTHING.

18:06.326 --> 18:07.728
YOUR GRANDPA?

18:07.728 --> 18:09.730
MOM'S TAKING OVER TODAY.
WHICH IS FRANKLY A BUMMER

18:09.730 --> 18:11.331
'CAUSE LOOKING AFTER HIM
IS THE ONLY THING

18:11.331 --> 18:12.332
I HAD TO DO
ALL SUMMER.

18:12.332 --> 18:13.894
I KNOW.
IT'S BEEN SO WEIRD.

18:13.894 --> 18:15.896
‐ NO BALLET.
‐ I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME

18:15.896 --> 18:18.498
THERE'S BEEN NO BALLET.
I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING
FORWARD TO SCHOOL.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.180
‐ ME TOO.
‐ EVEN MATH.

18:20.180 --> 18:21.341
WHAT'S THAT CRAZINESS
ALL ABOUT?

18:21.341 --> 18:23.183
OH NO, I JUST
THOUGHT OF SOMETHING.

18:23.183 --> 18:24.344
WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO TAKE GYM.

18:24.344 --> 18:26.106
‐ WHAT? WHY?
‐ NO BALLET,

18:26.106 --> 18:27.307
NO NOTES FROM MADAME FANNY.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.750
UGH. TEAMS, BALLS,
HIGH FIVES.

18:29.750 --> 18:31.191
COACH CONTRATTI'S MOLE.

18:31.191 --> 18:32.432
Melanie: <i>I DON'T UNDERSTAND.</i>

18:32.432 --> 18:33.914
<i>I THOUGHT PHYSICAL EDUCATION</i>
<i>IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS</i>

18:33.914 --> 18:35.275
<i>WENT THE WAY</i>
<i>OF THE DINOSAURS.</i>

18:35.275 --> 18:36.757
Ginny: <i>BLAME BAKE SALES.</i>
<i>THEY FUND THIS MADNESS.</i>

18:36.757 --> 18:38.278
Melanie: <i>IRONIC, ISN'T IT?</i>
<i>THEY SELL YOU CUPCAKES</i>

18:38.278 --> 18:39.439
<i>TO GET YOU FAT,</i>
<i>AND THEN OF COURSE</i>

18:39.439 --> 18:40.440
<i>YOU HAVE TO RUN AROUND</i>
<i>LIKE AN IDIOT</i>

18:40.440 --> 18:41.922
<i>FOR AN HOUR EVERY DAY.</i>

18:41.922 --> 18:43.363
Ginny: <i>AH! KNEE SOCKS.</i>
<i>I FORGOT ABOUT THE KNEE SOCKS.</i>

18:43.363 --> 18:45.125
Melanie: <i>MAYBE WE CAN</i>
<i>SAY WE'RE SICK.</i>

18:45.125 --> 18:47.367
‐ FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR?
‐ YEAH. MY COUSIN DID IT.

18:47.367 --> 18:49.530
‐ NEXT IDEA.
‐ MAYBE WE CAN
FORGE A NOTE

18:49.530 --> 18:50.891
WITH MADAME FANNY'S
NAME ON IT.

18:50.891 --> 18:52.492
THAT WOULD BE
A NEAT TRICK.

18:53.493 --> 18:55.536
I JUST SAW YOU GIRLS
SITTING HERE

18:55.536 --> 18:57.177
AND I THOUGHT I WOULD
COME OVER AND SAY HELLO.

18:58.979 --> 19:00.420
HELLO.

19:03.383 --> 19:04.705
NOW YOU SAY
HELLO BACK.

19:04.705 --> 19:06.547
Both: HELLO.

19:06.547 --> 19:08.268
MAY I SIT DOWN?

19:08.268 --> 19:10.591
UH, SURE.

19:13.473 --> 19:15.796
SO HOW'S YOUR
SUMMER BEEN?

19:15.796 --> 19:18.238
‐ FINE.
‐ YEAH, FINE.

19:18.238 --> 19:20.801
GOOD.

19:20.801 --> 19:22.643
BOO'S SUMMER
HAS BEEN...?

19:22.643 --> 19:25.205
Both: FINE.

19:26.807 --> 19:28.408
HOW DID SASHA
LIKE JOFFREY?

19:28.408 --> 19:30.290
SHE'S GOT
A COUPLE MORE WEEKS.

19:30.290 --> 19:33.253
OH, I THOUGHT SHE'D
BE BACK BY NOW.

19:33.253 --> 19:34.655
WELL, HAVE YOU
HEARD FROM HER?

19:34.655 --> 19:36.256
YEAH.

19:36.256 --> 19:38.539
SHE'S FINE.

19:38.539 --> 19:39.660
RIGHT.

19:39.660 --> 19:41.261
OH, UH,
THAT'S NOT OURS.

19:41.261 --> 19:42.262
YEAH, WE DIDN'T
ORDER THAT.

19:42.262 --> 19:43.664
‐ YES YOU DID. YES.
‐ NO.

19:43.664 --> 19:45.506
WE DON'T EAT
STUFF LIKE THAT EVER.

19:45.506 --> 19:47.067
LOOK, I'M NOT
ONE OF THOSE WAITERS

19:47.067 --> 19:48.669
WHO SAYS THEY GOT IT
AND THEY DON'T GOT IT.

19:48.669 --> 19:50.270
I WRITE STUFF DOWN.

19:50.270 --> 19:52.072
TWO FRIES,
TWO ONION RINGS,

19:52.072 --> 19:53.193
CORN DOG BITES
FOR "B."

19:53.193 --> 19:55.075
I WROTE "B" FOR BLONDE.
YOU'RE BLONDE.

19:55.075 --> 19:56.436
<i>SWEET POTATO CHIPS,</i>
<i>CHICKEN FINGERS,</i>

19:56.436 --> 19:58.278
<i>CHEESE STRAWS,</i>
<i>AND JALAPENO POPPERS.</i>

19:58.278 --> 19:59.840
I DREW TWO PIG FACES
BECAUSE THERE'S TWO OF YOU

19:59.840 --> 20:01.321
AND WE CALL THIS
THE PIG PLATTER
IN THE KITCHEN.

20:01.321 --> 20:02.763
‐ LOOK, CAN YOU JUST‐‐
‐ NO. IF I TAKE IT BACK

20:02.763 --> 20:03.924
I PAY FOR IT
OR I EAT IT,

20:03.924 --> 20:05.325
NEITHER SCENARIO'S
GONNA HAPPEN.

20:05.325 --> 20:06.887
BE RIGHT BACK WITH
THE CHEESE SAUCE.

20:10.370 --> 20:12.292
RELAX, GIRLS.
I KNOW IT'S SUMMER.

20:12.292 --> 20:15.295
THIS IS THE TIME
TO EAT JUNK FOOD
AND GO CRAZY.

20:15.295 --> 20:16.937
IT'S FINE.

20:20.861 --> 20:23.624
WELL, I JUST WANTED
TO SAY HELLO.

20:23.624 --> 20:24.985
Both: HELLO.

20:24.985 --> 20:26.667
NICE TO SEE YOU.

20:26.667 --> 20:28.709
MADAME FANNY?

20:30.390 --> 20:31.712
HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM MICHELLE?

20:31.712 --> 20:33.874
UH, YES.

20:33.874 --> 20:37.317
SHE SENT A NOTE WITH
A FORWARDING ADDRESS.

20:37.317 --> 20:38.719
SHE'S FINE.

20:48.569 --> 20:50.330
HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

20:50.330 --> 20:51.652
‐ WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
‐ WHERE'S THE PACKAGE?

20:51.652 --> 20:53.654
‐ SCREW THE PACKAGE!

21:07.708 --> 21:08.509
I DON'T WANT TO SAY.

21:08.509 --> 21:10.671
‐ YOU HAVE TO SAY.
‐ I CAN'T.

21:10.671 --> 21:12.513
BOO, I SPENT
THE LAST TWO MONTHS

21:12.513 --> 21:15.355

23:30.250 --> 23:31.692
I COULD WATCH THIS
FOREVER. IT'S GENIUS.

23:31.692 --> 23:33.453
STOP.
IT'S HORRIBLE.

23:33.453 --> 23:34.695
WHY IS IT HORRIBLE?

23:34.695 --> 23:37.217
BECAUSE MICHELLE
IS GOING TO HATE ME.

23:37.217 --> 23:39.419
WELL, MICHELLE'S NOT HERE.
AND BEING HATED FROM AFAR

23:39.419 --> 23:40.821
IS LIKE NOT
BEING HATED AT ALL.

23:40.821 --> 23:44.144
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER TALKING
TO ANY NEWS PEOPLE THAT NIGHT.

23:44.144 --> 23:45.345
( gasps )
BOO, THE PACKAGE!

23:45.345 --> 23:46.346
SHOOT. I FORGOT.

23:51.712 --> 23:53.554
THAT IS THE WORST
SMELLING BROOM CLOSET

23:53.554 --> 23:54.715
I HAVE EVER BEEN IN.

23:54.715 --> 23:56.717
YOU'VE BEEN IN A LOT
OF BROOM CLOSETS, HAVE YOU?

23:56.717 --> 23:57.718
ENOUGH TO KNOW IT SHOULDN'T
SMELL LIKE A BROOM

23:57.718 --> 23:59.720
FROM "SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE."

23:59.720 --> 24:01.882
SOUND ON.
SOUND OFF.

24:01.882 --> 24:03.123
DOESN'T MATTER.
STILL GREAT.

24:03.123 --> 24:04.484
LET ME SEE IT AGAIN.

24:04.484 --> 24:05.646
IN CASE YOU'RE
WONDERING,

24:05.646 --> 24:06.727
THIS IS NOT
SUPPORTIVE.

24:06.727 --> 24:09.890
‐ Nanette: <i>BOO?</i>
‐ GO GO GO.

24:09.890 --> 24:11.612
I COULD READ A BOOK.
DO WE HAVE BOOKS?

24:11.612 --> 24:12.813
I WILL GET
YOU A BOOK.

24:12.813 --> 24:14.575
BECAUSE IF I READ A BOOK,
IT WILL GET MY MIND

24:14.575 --> 24:16.136
OFF THE FACT THAT
I'M GOING INSANE.

24:16.136 --> 24:17.738
I'LL JUST READ THE BOOK
AND BY THE TIME I FINISH,

24:17.738 --> 24:19.580
I'LL JUST THINK
I WAS ALWAYS LIKE THAT.

24:19.580 --> 24:20.781
SITTING IN
THE LIVING ROOM COUNTS?

24:20.781 --> 24:22.623
‐ SURE.
‐ OKAY.

24:24.144 --> 24:26.747
JUST GOT SUPER FRIENDLY
WITH A WET‐VAC.

24:26.747 --> 24:28.388
WE JUST PASSED
TWO MILLION HITS.

24:28.388 --> 24:30.591
YES. TAKE THAT,
CLEFT PALATE CHOIR.

24:30.591 --> 24:32.392
‐ WHOO!
‐ DO NOT "WHOO" THIS.

24:32.392 --> 24:35.155
THIS IS NOT A "WHOO" THING.
WE ARE NOT "WHOO"ING THIS.

24:35.155 --> 24:36.757
BOO, RELAX.

24:36.757 --> 24:38.759
THIS IS YOUR
15 MINUTES OF FAME.

24:38.759 --> 24:40.200
ANDY WARHOL, BABY.

24:40.200 --> 24:43.844
OKAY. NOT THAT I DON'T ENJOY
HAVING YOU IN MY BROOM CLOSET,

24:43.844 --> 24:45.526
BUT WHEN ARE YOU EVER
GOING TO GO HOME?

24:45.526 --> 24:47.007
EVENTUALLY.

24:47.007 --> 24:48.609
YOU'VE BEEN HERE
FOR OVER A WEEK.

24:48.609 --> 24:50.330
YOU DON'T THINK
THEY'LL GET WISE?

24:50.330 --> 24:52.012
LOOK. ALL THEY KNOW IS
THAT UNTIL SCHOOL STARTS,

24:52.012 --> 24:55.175
I'M AT JOFFREY.
THAT'S MY STORY AND
I'M STICKING TO IT.

24:55.175 --> 24:56.857
MAYBE THINGS GOT
BETTER BETWEEN THEM

24:56.857 --> 24:57.938
WHILE YOU WERE GONE.

24:57.938 --> 25:00.140
MAYBE MICHELLE WILL THINK
THE VIDEO'S FUNNY.

25:00.140 --> 25:01.582
NICE, SASHA.

25:01.582 --> 25:03.624
<i>BOO?</i>

25:03.624 --> 25:06.026
YOUR BROTHER DID A WEIRD
STICKY THING IN THE‐‐

25:06.026 --> 25:07.427
‐ I GOT IT.
‐ OKAY.

25:13.834 --> 25:15.395
( chuckling )

25:19.800 --> 25:22.202
<i>( scattered applause )</i>

25:22.202 --> 25:23.804
THANK YOU,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

25:23.804 --> 25:25.365
I'M JO‐JO DELINE.

25:25.365 --> 25:27.127
THIS IS TWO SHAKES
OF STARDUST.

25:27.127 --> 25:29.089
AND IF YOU STILL
WANT TO SEE SOMETHING,

25:30.210 --> 25:31.932
WE'RE BACK
IN AN HOUR.

25:34.214 --> 25:37.217
<i>( music playing )</i>

25:48.228 --> 25:49.910
<i>( song ends )</i>

25:49.910 --> 25:51.071
<i>( scattered applause )</i>

25:53.674 --> 25:56.236
THANKS FOR THE FAT GUY,
MICHELLE.

25:56.236 --> 25:57.838
HEY, HE WASN'T
CLAUSTROPHOBIC.

25:57.838 --> 25:59.479
HE BARELY FIT
IN THE BOX.

25:59.479 --> 26:01.602
AMERICANS LIKE FRIES.
WHAT CAN I SAY?

26:01.602 --> 26:04.685
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF AN ATTITUDE TONIGHT.

26:05.926 --> 26:08.008
I UNDERSTAND.
I'M AN ARTIST TOO.

26:08.008 --> 26:09.329
I HAVE TEMPERAMENTAL DAYS.

26:09.329 --> 26:12.012
JUST DON'T FORGET WHO'S
PAYING THE BILLS.

26:12.012 --> 26:13.053
ONE MORE THING.

26:13.053 --> 26:15.015
YOU FORGOT TO CLAP.

26:15.015 --> 26:15.856
WHAT?

26:15.856 --> 26:18.859
WHEN I SAY
"YOU WANNA SEE SOMETHING?"

26:18.859 --> 26:20.661
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CLAP.

26:20.661 --> 26:22.262
‐ CLAP?
‐ YES, CLAP.

26:22.262 --> 26:23.504
GET THE AUDIENCE
INTO IT.

26:23.504 --> 26:24.945
YOU GOTTA CLAP.
CISSY CLAPS.

26:24.945 --> 26:26.066
I DO. I CLAP.

26:26.066 --> 26:27.187
SO JUST
TO BE CLEAR AGAIN,

26:27.187 --> 26:29.710
I SAY "YOU WANNA
SEE SOMETHING?"

26:29.710 --> 26:31.311
YOU CLAP, GOT IT?

26:34.875 --> 26:36.276
IT'S COMPLETELY
REDUNDANT, YOU KNOW?

26:36.276 --> 26:37.718
WHAT IS?

26:37.718 --> 26:40.280
YOUR CATCHPHRASE.
"YOU WANNA SEE SOMETHING?"

26:40.280 --> 26:42.723
THE VERY FACT THAT
THEY CAME TO SEE A SHOW

26:42.723 --> 26:45.445
<i>MEANS THEY WANT</i>
<i>TO SEE SOMETHING.</i>

26:45.445 --> 26:46.887
THEY'RE HERE.
THEY CAME HERE.

26:46.887 --> 26:48.128
YOU DON'T NEED
TO KEEP ASKING THEM

26:48.128 --> 26:50.891
OVER AND OVER IF THEY
WANNA SEE SOMETHING.

26:50.891 --> 26:53.734
PLUS, YOUR SIGN
SAYS "WANT TO,"

26:53.734 --> 26:55.055
AND YOU KEEP
SAYING "WANNA,"

26:55.055 --> 26:56.056
SO YOU'RE NOT
EVEN MIMICKING

26:56.056 --> 26:57.257
THE RIDICULOUS SIGN
YOU PUT UP THERE.

27:04.905 --> 27:08.909
A MAN PUTS EVERYTHING
HE HAS INTO AN ACT.

27:08.909 --> 27:10.511
A SIGN.

27:11.992 --> 27:14.955
<i>AND YOU HAVE THE NERVE</i>

27:14.955 --> 27:15.916
TO TELL HIM
IT'S WRONG?

27:15.916 --> 27:18.318
MY SIGN'S WRONG?

27:18.318 --> 27:21.001
I'M SAYING
MY OWN SAYING, WRONG?

27:21.001 --> 27:22.923
YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:22.923 --> 27:23.964
I DON'T WANT YOU
HOLDING THE BIRD.

27:23.964 --> 27:25.325
NOW YOU DID IT.

27:25.325 --> 27:26.767
CISSY'S GOT THE BIRD.

27:26.767 --> 27:28.168
YOU CAN FOCUS
ON YOUR CLAPPING

27:28.168 --> 27:30.330
AND YOUR
CRAPPY ATTITUDE.

27:30.330 --> 27:33.934
NOW I'M GONNA PUT THAT
SPEAKER IN THE CAR.

27:33.934 --> 27:36.577
COME BACK,
GET THAT SPEAKER,
PUT IT IN THE CAR,

27:36.577 --> 27:38.939
GET THE CORDS AND MONITOR,
PUT THEM IN THE CAR,

27:38.939 --> 27:41.782
CHANGE, PUT MY
COSTUME IN THE CAR,

27:41.782 --> 27:43.343
AND THEN I'M GONNA
TAKE MY WIFE

27:43.343 --> 27:45.946
OUT TO DINNER
BECAUSE SHE EARNED IT.

27:45.946 --> 27:48.308
SHE CLAPS
LIKE A CHAMP.

27:58.358 --> 27:59.800
( sighs )

28:31.832 --> 28:32.913
IS THIS YOUR HUMMUS?

28:32.913 --> 28:33.994
IT WAS.

28:33.994 --> 28:35.315
IT'S GOOD.

28:35.315 --> 28:36.557
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

28:36.557 --> 28:37.998
I ATE HIS HUMMUS.

28:37.998 --> 28:40.000
I HEARD SOMETHING
AND CAME OUT TO
SEE WHAT IT WAS.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.842
IT WAS ME
EATING HIS HUMMUS.

28:41.842 --> 28:43.403
I DIDN'T THINK
SHE WAS GONNA BE HERE.

28:43.403 --> 28:44.845
WHY DIDN'T YOU THINK‐‐

28:44.845 --> 28:46.086
OH CRAP.

28:46.086 --> 28:47.167
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HOME YET.

28:47.167 --> 28:48.168
I'M SO SORRY.
I FORGOT.

28:48.168 --> 28:50.010
OH, I JUST HAD
THIS TERRIBLE NIGHT.

28:50.010 --> 28:51.091
I GOT INTO
THIS GIANT FIGHT

28:51.091 --> 28:53.093
WITH JO‐JO,
THE AMAZING IDIOT.

28:53.093 --> 28:54.254
SHE'S GONNA EAT
THE WHOLE THING.

28:54.254 --> 28:56.657
I MADE FUN OF HIS SIGN AND
I TOLD HIM HE WAS A MORON,

28:56.657 --> 28:58.018
AND HERE'S WHAT
A GIANT LOSER I AM,

28:58.018 --> 28:59.259
I DIDN'T EVEN
GET FIRED.

28:59.259 --> 29:01.101
NOPE. THEY TOOK
THE BIRD AWAY FROM ME.

29:01.101 --> 29:02.182
I DON'T GET
TO HOLD THE BIRD.

29:02.182 --> 29:03.423
CISSY'S GOING
TO HOLD THE BIRD

29:03.423 --> 29:05.786
AND I'M GOING TO
STAND THERE DOING THIS.

29:05.786 --> 29:06.947
SO IF YOU SHOW UP
TOMORROW NIGHT

29:06.947 --> 29:08.268
EXCITED TO SEE ME
HOLDING THE BIRD,

29:08.268 --> 29:10.190
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED.

29:10.190 --> 29:11.151
WHAT IS SHE
TALKING ABOUT?

29:11.151 --> 29:13.033
SHE'S UPSET.
LET'S GO BACK TO BED.

29:13.033 --> 29:14.274
WHY IS SHE
STILL HERE?

29:14.274 --> 29:15.596
Talia: <i>SHE'S MY FRIEND.</i>

29:15.596 --> 29:17.117
Rick: <i>HOW LONG IS</i>
<i>SHE GONNA STAY?</i>

29:17.117 --> 29:18.519
<i>‐ I DON'T KNOW.</i>
<i>‐ I MEAN, SHE'S ALWAYS AROUND.</i>

29:18.519 --> 29:20.801
<i>SHE DOESN'T GO ANYWHERE.</i>
<i>WHY DOESN'T SHE DATE?</i>

29:20.801 --> 29:22.803
<i>IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG</i>
<i>WITH HER HOO‐HA?</i>

29:22.803 --> 29:24.885
Talia: <i>THERE'S NOTHING WRONG</i>
<i>WITH HER HOO‐HA.</i>

29:24.885 --> 29:27.367
<i>SHE'S HAD A BAD YEAR.</i>
<i>SHE'S STUCK.</i>

29:27.367 --> 29:29.890
<i>SHE'S NOT MOVING UP.</i>
<i>YOU HEARD, THEY TOOK</i>
<i>THE BIRD AWAY FROM HER.</i>

29:29.890 --> 29:31.051
<i>I'VE SEEN THE ACT...</i>

29:34.895 --> 29:36.697
<i>( "Nutcracker Macer"</i>
<i>music playing )</i>

29:36.697 --> 29:38.979
<i>♪ THEN SOMEONE GRABBED ME</i>
<i>AND SAID HEY ♪</i>

29:38.979 --> 29:40.460
<i>♪ IT'S TIME TO DANCE ♪</i>

29:40.460 --> 29:43.063
<i>♪ SHE MACED US ♪</i>

29:43.063 --> 29:44.064
<i>♪ IT'S TIME TO DANCE. ♪</i>

29:47.307 --> 29:48.829
YOU SURE
YOU LIKE THEM?

29:48.829 --> 29:50.911
‐ I AM SURE.
‐ THEY'RE REDDER
THAN I THOUGHT.

29:50.911 --> 29:51.832
I LIKE RED.

29:51.832 --> 29:52.993
I CAN
DO THEM AGAIN.

29:52.993 --> 29:54.394
DO NOT
DO THEM AGAIN.

29:54.394 --> 29:55.916
SO YOU LOVE THEM
AND YOU'RE HAPPY?

29:55.916 --> 29:56.917
‐ YES.
‐ WILL YOU COME SEE

29:56.917 --> 29:58.238
THE NEW
KITCHEN BOX I MADE?

29:58.238 --> 29:59.319
TAKE A BREAK, TRULY.

29:59.319 --> 30:00.721
<i>( groans )</i>
<i>OKAY.</i>

30:15.255 --> 30:17.257
<i>( wedding march playing )</i>

30:20.661 --> 30:22.743
Almost there.

30:22.743 --> 30:24.505
You're doing great.

30:24.505 --> 30:26.426
Okay. Wow!

30:26.426 --> 30:27.868
That walk is longer
than you think.

30:32.272 --> 30:34.274
Yes! Very nice.

30:34.274 --> 30:35.956
Are we ready
to begin?

30:35.956 --> 30:36.957
No encore?

30:36.957 --> 30:37.958
Yes.
We're ready.

30:37.958 --> 30:39.279
Yes!
Let's do it.

30:39.279 --> 30:41.682
<i>Okay.</i>

30:41.682 --> 30:42.883
<i>‐ Dearly beloved‐‐</i>
<i>‐ Wait, gotta pee.</i>

30:42.883 --> 30:44.685
Hold this.
Is that the bathroom?

30:44.685 --> 30:46.286
Isn't she something?

30:46.286 --> 30:47.447
Very special.

30:47.447 --> 30:48.448
Wrong way.

30:48.448 --> 30:49.690
Oh, sorry.
Giant flowers.

30:49.690 --> 30:50.691
( groans )

30:50.691 --> 30:52.292
I'm sorry.

30:52.292 --> 30:53.894
I'm really sorry.

30:53.894 --> 30:54.975
( grunts )

30:54.975 --> 30:56.977
You can just start again
when she gets back, right?

30:56.977 --> 30:59.099
‐ <i>Sure.</i>
‐ Great. Great.

30:59.099 --> 31:00.901
I'm excited.

31:00.901 --> 31:02.142
<i>You should be.</i>
<i>She's pretty.</i>

31:02.142 --> 31:03.544
Beautiful.

31:03.544 --> 31:04.985
The most beautiful girl
I've ever met.

31:04.985 --> 31:06.907
And I've met
Megan Fox.

31:06.907 --> 31:08.549
<i>Wow.</i>

31:08.549 --> 31:09.910
So, yeah.

31:09.910 --> 31:11.552
Boy, you should
see her on stage.

31:11.552 --> 31:13.393
‐ <i>She's an actress?</i>
‐ Dancer.

31:13.393 --> 31:15.315
Well, dancer now.
In the future,
who knows, right?

31:15.315 --> 31:18.919
Michelle: <i>Hey, screw you.</i>
<i>She told me to use this door!</i>

31:37.417 --> 31:38.939
‐ HEY, WHERE YOU GOING?
‐ GOTTA TALK TO SOMEONE.

31:38.939 --> 31:40.500
YOU CAN'T LEAVE. WE'RE
IN THE MIDDLE OF A SHOW.

31:40.500 --> 31:41.942
HEY, I'M NOT
HOLDING THE BIRD.

31:45.746 --> 31:47.107
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

31:47.107 --> 31:49.349
WELL, I CAME
TO SEE SOMETHING.

31:49.349 --> 31:50.430
HILARIOUS.

31:50.430 --> 31:52.072
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE ON STAGE?

31:52.072 --> 31:53.033
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE IN CALIFORNIA?

31:53.033 --> 31:56.356
I JUST WANTED TO SEE
HOW YOU'RE DOING.

31:56.356 --> 31:58.038
TAKE THIS MARTINI BACK

31:58.038 --> 32:00.040
AND BRING ONE THAT ACTUALLY
HAS GIN IN IT, PLEASE.

32:00.040 --> 32:01.041
I'M DOING GREAT.

32:02.282 --> 32:03.764
I WENT BY
YOUR APARTMENT.

32:03.764 --> 32:06.166
AN OLDER GENTLEMAN
ANSWERED THE DOOR.
IS HE YOURS?

32:06.166 --> 32:07.287
NO. HE'S TALIA'S.

32:07.287 --> 32:10.050
‐ TALIA'S FATHER?
‐ TALIA'S... DADDY.

32:10.050 --> 32:11.772
WELL, WE HAD
A LOVELY CONVERSATION

32:11.772 --> 32:14.214
ABOUT EISENHOWER
AND YOUR HOO‐HA.

32:14.214 --> 32:15.616
AND THEN HE TOLD ME
I COULD FIND YOU HERE,

32:15.616 --> 32:17.137
‐ SO I DID.
‐ I SEE.

32:17.137 --> 32:20.020
I WOULDN'T GO HOME
WITHOUT SOME HUMMUS, FYI.

32:20.020 --> 32:21.101
THANKS FOR
THE TIP.

32:21.982 --> 32:23.984
SO, YOU DON'T
WORK IN VEGAS.

32:23.984 --> 32:25.706
‐ NO.
‐ YOU WORK HERE.

32:25.706 --> 32:26.987
YES.

32:26.987 --> 32:27.988

32:29.389 --> 32:30.711
WELL, I HAVE TO TELL YOU

32:30.711 --> 32:32.553
I HAVEN'T DRIVEN TO
A PLACE THIS CHARMING

32:32.553 --> 32:35.235
SINCE THE CITY GAVE US
CURBSIDE RECYCLING BINS.

32:35.235 --> 32:36.476
YOU'VE COME TO
APPLY FOR A JOB

32:36.476 --> 32:38.078
AT THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE,
IS THAT IT?

32:38.078 --> 32:39.800
I CAME TO
TALK TO YOU.

32:41.401 --> 32:43.083
NO.

32:43.083 --> 32:45.005
‐ WILL YOU SIT DOWN?
‐ I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF A SHOW.

32:45.005 --> 32:47.127
I THINK THEY CAN HANDLE
BEING IGNORED WITHOUT YOU.

32:47.127 --> 32:49.169
FANNY, JUST GO.

32:49.169 --> 32:50.410
SO THIS IS BETTER?

32:50.410 --> 32:52.212
‐ BETTER THAN WHAT?
‐ BETTER THAN HOME?

32:52.212 --> 32:53.133
PARADISE IS
NOT MY HOME.

32:53.133 --> 32:55.295
YOU OWN LAND THERE.
YOU HAVE A HOUSE THERE.

32:55.295 --> 32:56.296
YOU HAVE STUDENTS THERE.

32:56.296 --> 32:57.818
ALL YOURS.
NOT MINE.

32:57.818 --> 32:59.019
‐ MICHELLE‐‐
‐ DO YOU WANT ME TO
SIGN SOMETHING?

32:59.019 --> 33:00.420
IS THAT IT? FINE.
I'LL SIGN IT

33:00.420 --> 33:01.902
ALL OVER TO YOU.
I DON'T WANT IT.

33:01.902 --> 33:04.064
I'M FINE RIGHT HERE.

33:04.064 --> 33:06.106
I SAW YOUR WEDDING VIDEO
THIS MORNING.

33:06.106 --> 33:07.628
I HAVE A WEDDING VIDEO?

33:07.628 --> 33:09.349
YES, I ASSUMED FROM
THE CONDITION YOU WERE IN

33:09.349 --> 33:10.831
YOU MIGHT NOT
REMEMBER IT.

33:10.831 --> 33:11.912
YOU DO KNOW
YOU GOT MARRIED?

33:11.912 --> 33:12.913
YES, I KNOW
I GOT MARRIED.

33:12.913 --> 33:14.034
AND YOU KNOW IT
WAS TO HUBBELL?

33:14.034 --> 33:15.115
YES, I KNOW I GOT
MARRIED TO HUBBELL,

33:15.115 --> 33:16.757
AND HUBBELL WAS
A WONDERFUL GUY.

33:16.757 --> 33:18.118
WAY TOO GOOD FOR ME.
IS THAT WHAT YOU
WANT TO HEAR?

33:18.118 --> 33:19.840
‐ NO.
‐ HE WOULD HAVE
DUMPED ME IN A MONTH

33:19.840 --> 33:21.201
AND GONE BACK
TO TRULY.

33:21.201 --> 33:22.282
‐ IS THAT WHAT YOU
WANT TO HEAR?
‐ NO.

33:22.282 --> 33:23.924
<i>HE WOULD HAVE REALIZED</i>
<i>HE WAS OUT OF HIS MIND.</i>

33:23.924 --> 33:26.206
THAT VEGAS MADE HIM CRAZY.
HE WOULD HAVE DROPPED
TO HIS KNEES

33:26.206 --> 33:29.129
AND ASKED YOUR FORGIVENESS
FOR BRINGING THE DEVIL TO
PARADISE?

33:29.129 --> 33:31.291
I CAN'T TAKE YOU LIKE
THIS WITHOUT A DRINK.

33:31.291 --> 33:33.053
( sighs )
I'M GOING
BACK ON STAGE.

33:33.053 --> 33:34.334
MICHELLE,
JUST COME HOME.

33:34.334 --> 33:35.415
YOU DON'T
WANT ME THERE.

33:35.415 --> 33:37.097
‐ OF COURSE I DO.
‐ <i>NO, FANNY.</i>

33:37.097 --> 33:39.580
YOU DON'T.
YOU FEEL SOME WEIRD
OBLIGATION TO ME

33:39.580 --> 33:41.061
THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

33:41.061 --> 33:43.103
I FEEL AN OBLIGATION TO YOU
BECAUSE YOU'RE FAMILY.

33:43.103 --> 33:44.304
I AM NOT
YOUR FAMILY.

33:44.304 --> 33:46.627
YOU MARRIED MY SON.
THAT MAKES YOU FAMILY.

33:46.627 --> 33:48.148
WE WERE MARRIED
FOR A MINUTE.

33:48.148 --> 33:50.350
YOU GET MARRIED,
YOU GET FAMILY.

33:50.350 --> 33:52.472
THAT'S THE DEAL.
THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE.

33:52.472 --> 33:54.635
LIKE IT OR NOT,
I AM YOUR MOTHER‐IN‐LAW

33:54.635 --> 33:56.076
FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE.

33:56.076 --> 33:58.559
WE ARE PERMANENTLY
CONNECTED.

33:58.559 --> 34:01.321
AND IT'S RIDICULOUS
THAT YOU'RE SLEEPING
ON A COUCH AT YOUR AGE.

34:01.321 --> 34:03.644
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU
HAVE A HOME AND A JOB

34:03.644 --> 34:05.566
AND A TOWN FULL OF
PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT YOU.

34:05.566 --> 34:07.247
‐ PEOPLE WHO
CARE ABOUT ME?
‐ YES.

34:07.247 --> 34:08.809
THOSE SAME PEOPLE
DROVE ME OUT OF TOWN

34:08.809 --> 34:10.250
WITH TORCHES
AND PITCHFORKS.

34:10.250 --> 34:11.411
BECAUSE YOU MACED
THEIR CHILDREN.

34:11.411 --> 34:12.573
WHATEVER.

34:12.573 --> 34:14.414
MACING THEIR CHILDREN
IS NOT A WHATEVER.

34:14.414 --> 34:15.736
YOU DIDN'T
WANT ME TO STAY.

34:15.736 --> 34:17.097
YOU BLAME ME FOR
MICHAEL LEAVING.

34:17.097 --> 34:18.258
YOU BLAME ME FOR
RUINING YOUR NUTCRACKER.

34:18.258 --> 34:19.900
‐ YOU BLAME ME FOR‐‐
‐ FINE, YES.

34:19.900 --> 34:21.421
I WAS ANGRY AT YOU.

34:21.421 --> 34:24.104
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN GET UPSET,
HAVE A BAD DAY?

34:24.104 --> 34:26.867
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN SAY SOMETHING
STUPID AND HURTFUL?

34:26.867 --> 34:28.428
BECAUSE YOU DO.

34:28.428 --> 34:29.990
YOU MEDDLE
AND YOU DON'T THINK

34:29.990 --> 34:31.391
AND YOU TALK TALK
TALK TALK TALK.

34:31.391 --> 34:33.153
GREAT, NOW I'M GONE.
PROBLEM SOLVED.

34:33.153 --> 34:34.434
WHAT ARE YOU, 12?

34:34.434 --> 34:36.997
SOMEONE GETS MAD AT YOU
SO YOU JUST RUN AWAY?

34:36.997 --> 34:38.559
‐ TO THIS PLACE?
‐ FANNY.

34:38.559 --> 34:40.320
YOU DON'T BELONG
IN THIS PLACE.

34:40.320 --> 34:43.003
THIS PERSON BELONGS
IN THIS PLACE.

34:43.003 --> 34:44.284
WHERE ARE
THE OLIVES?

34:44.284 --> 34:45.285
( sighs )

34:46.807 --> 34:48.529
MY SON LOVED YOU.

34:48.529 --> 34:51.211
HE WANTED YOU TO HAVE
A CERTAIN KIND OF LIFE.

34:51.211 --> 34:52.533
AND IF I JUST
LET YOU STAY HERE

34:52.533 --> 34:54.134
AND DON'T TRY TO
MAKE THAT HAPPEN,

34:54.134 --> 34:55.976
THEN I AM NOT
HONORING HIS MEMORY.

34:55.976 --> 34:58.138
HUBBELL SAW
SOMETHING IN YOU.

34:58.138 --> 35:00.020
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SEE
IT IN YOURSELF EVENTUALLY.

35:00.020 --> 35:02.302
OTHERWISE...

35:02.302 --> 35:04.144
PEOPLE TOLD ME
DAUGHTERS WERE
HARDER.

35:04.144 --> 35:06.146
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS
BECAUSE THEY COULD GET
PREGNANT.

35:17.923 --> 35:20.219
KING ME.

35:20.219 --> 35:23.149
YOU ARE SO NOT ASLEEP,
COME ON!

35:23.149 --> 35:25.411
JEFF, DO YOU HAVE SOME
MENTHOLATED BALM BACK THERE?

35:25.411 --> 35:27.333
WHY WOULD WE HAVE
MENTHOLATED BALM
IN THE KITCHEN?

35:27.333 --> 35:28.934
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
EVERYTHING TASTES LIKE.

35:28.934 --> 35:30.736
I CAN REFUSE
TO SERVE YOU.
IT'S ON THE SIGN.

35:30.736 --> 35:32.938
LOOK, PAL, THIS IS
A COMMUNITY PLACE.

35:32.938 --> 35:34.740
WORD GETS OUT YOU
DON'T SERVE VETERANS,

35:34.740 --> 35:36.101
IT IS NOT
GOING TO BE GOOD.

35:36.101 --> 35:37.743
VETERANS OF WHAT?

35:37.743 --> 35:39.705
LIFE, PAL.

35:39.705 --> 35:41.186
WATCH HIM.

35:41.186 --> 35:43.189
I'M NOT WATCHING HIM.
I'M NOT WATCHING HIM.

35:45.511 --> 35:47.112
‐ WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
‐ I NEED THE KEYS.

35:47.112 --> 35:49.114
‐ YOU CAN'T STAY AT MY
GRANDPA'S ANYMORE.
‐ WHY NOT?

35:49.114 --> 35:50.756
THEY PUT IN HIS
MOTORIZED LIFT TODAY.

35:50.756 --> 35:52.758
‐ HE CAN GO
UPSTAIRS NOW.
‐ GREAT.

35:52.758 --> 35:54.119
HE WANTS TO SLEEP
IN HIS OWN BEDROOM.

35:54.119 --> 35:56.762
FIRST NIGHT
SINCE GRANDMA DIED.

35:56.762 --> 35:59.965
I'M SORRY, I'VE BEEN
SLEEPING IN YOUR DEAD
GRANDMOTHER'S BED?

35:59.965 --> 36:01.126
SORRY, CALL BOO.

36:04.690 --> 36:06.131
YOU CAN'T
STAY HERE TONIGHT.

36:06.131 --> 36:07.973
MY MOM IS COMPLETELY
FREAKING OUT.

36:07.973 --> 36:10.015
I'LL HIDE OUT
IN THE GUEST ROOM.
SHE WON'T KNOW I'M THERE.

36:10.015 --> 36:11.977
NO, YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.

36:11.977 --> 36:14.980
SHE HAS PASSED INTO
A DARK, DARK PLACE.

36:14.980 --> 36:16.382
‐ YOU CAN'T BE HERE.
‐ BUT‐‐

36:16.382 --> 36:17.503
‐ <i>Go to Ginny's.</i>
‐ BOO!

36:17.503 --> 36:18.504
I HAVE TO GO.

36:21.507 --> 36:23.789
HEY, MOM. CAN I
GET YOU ANYTHING?

36:23.789 --> 36:26.392
TELL YOUR FATHER
TO COME SEE ME
WHEN HE GETS HOME.

36:27.793 --> 36:29.074
<i>GINNY, COME ON.</i>

36:29.074 --> 36:31.076
‐ CAN'T.
‐ THE PLACE IS EMPTY.

36:31.076 --> 36:32.798
THE PLACE IS SOLD.
WE'RE IN ESCROW

36:32.798 --> 36:33.919
AND I'VE GOT
INSPECTORS HERE.

36:33.919 --> 36:35.241
‐ ONE NIGHT.
‐ SASHA,

36:35.241 --> 36:37.162
THE FIRST THREE DAYS
OF ESCROW ARE CRUCIAL.

36:37.162 --> 36:38.804
THAT'S WHERE EVERYTHING
CAN FALL APART.

36:38.804 --> 36:40.646
HEY!

36:40.646 --> 36:41.647
THAT JUST
NEEDS GLUE.

36:41.647 --> 36:43.088
YOU DON'T NEED
TO CHECK IT.

36:43.088 --> 36:44.810
IT'S FINE.
IT'S FINE, IT'S FINE.

36:44.810 --> 36:46.652
LOOK, MEL CAN'T TAKE ME,

36:46.652 --> 36:48.654
BOO'S MOM'S GONE
OFF THE RESERVATION,

36:48.654 --> 36:50.256
‐ WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?
‐ GO HOME.

36:50.256 --> 36:52.017
YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO EVENTUALLY.

36:52.017 --> 36:53.419
OH, I'M SORRY,
I HAVE TO‐‐

36:53.419 --> 36:55.421
DO NOT LIGHT
THE PILOT ON
THAT STOVE!

36:57.503 --> 36:59.024
<i>We met here.</i>

36:59.024 --> 37:02.268
<i>Well, not here,</i>
<i>obviously, Vegas.</i>

37:02.268 --> 37:04.029
She was dancing
in this show.

37:04.029 --> 37:06.432
I saw it maybe
100 times.

37:06.432 --> 37:09.114
<i>‐ That's a lot.</i>
<i>‐ Yes.</i>

37:09.114 --> 37:11.837
I think I told her I saw it
only 60 times though.

37:11.837 --> 37:13.439
Tried to make it
seem less creepy.

37:13.439 --> 37:17.042
Uh, probably still
seemed creepy.

37:17.042 --> 37:18.844
But look at me now.

37:18.844 --> 37:19.845
I got her.

37:19.845 --> 37:21.767
Duckie got Molly.

37:21.767 --> 37:24.210
Minister: <i>Hey, do you mind if</i>
<i>I get them in while we're</i>
<i>waiting?</i>

37:24.210 --> 37:26.051
What? Oh, no, sure.
Go ahead.

37:26.051 --> 37:27.052
Okay, folks.

37:29.215 --> 37:30.696
Okay.

37:30.696 --> 37:32.458
I wonder if Michelle would
have wanted a real wedding.

37:32.458 --> 37:34.700
You know?
With a white dress

37:34.700 --> 37:36.141
and the friends
and family.

37:36.141 --> 37:38.143
<i>She doesn't seem real</i>
<i>traditional to me.</i>

37:38.143 --> 37:40.226
She's not.
( chuckles )

37:40.226 --> 37:41.787
<i>Oh, my mother's</i>
<i>gonna have a fit</i>

37:41.787 --> 37:43.709
<i>not being here</i>
<i>to see this.</i>

37:43.709 --> 37:46.071
It's my prediction however,
that eventually she's gonna
love Michelle

37:46.071 --> 37:48.033
more than
she loves me.

37:48.033 --> 37:50.236
<i>Michelle's, um‐‐</i>

37:50.236 --> 37:52.238
Well, she's special.

37:52.238 --> 37:53.319
Have you ever
met a person

37:53.319 --> 37:55.160
that had no idea how
incredible they are

37:55.160 --> 37:56.882
<i>but you do?</i>
<i>You see it?</i>

37:56.882 --> 37:58.083
<i>That's Michelle.</i>

37:58.083 --> 38:00.486
<i>I mean, you spend</i>
<i>five minutes with her</i>

38:00.486 --> 38:03.168
<i>and first, you're</i>
<i>gonna be exhausted</i>

38:03.168 --> 38:04.410
<i>because she's smart,</i>
<i>she's fast,</i>

38:04.410 --> 38:06.252
and you have to
work hard to keep up.

38:06.252 --> 38:08.494
But then you
take her in,

38:08.494 --> 38:11.497
you see her,

38:11.497 --> 38:13.899
and it's spectacular.

38:13.899 --> 38:15.501
She doesn't know it yet,
but she's gonna do

38:15.501 --> 38:17.903
some really
great things.

38:17.903 --> 38:20.105
I'm gonna make sure
that happens.

38:20.105 --> 38:21.186
I'm back.

38:21.186 --> 38:22.748
FYI, you need
more toilet paper.

38:22.748 --> 38:23.909
Are you backing out?

38:23.909 --> 38:25.191
No way.

38:25.191 --> 38:27.353
I am right here.

38:29.755 --> 38:30.756
Hi, pal.

38:32.198 --> 38:35.481
Minister: <i>Dearly beloved,</i>
<i>we are gathered here today...</i>

39:13.959 --> 39:15.160
( knocking on door )

39:17.563 --> 39:19.164
‐ HI.
‐ HI.

39:21.567 --> 39:22.968
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

39:22.968 --> 39:24.570
TECHNOLOGY'S
A BEAUTIFUL THING.

39:27.573 --> 39:29.815
SO THIS IS
YOUR PLACE?

39:29.815 --> 39:32.978
‐ NO.
‐ OKAY.

39:32.978 --> 39:34.580
HOW WAS KANSAS?

39:34.580 --> 39:36.302
MYSTIFYING.

39:36.302 --> 39:38.183
AND WHY DID
YOU GO THERE?

39:38.183 --> 39:40.746
MY AUNT.
WE GO IN THE SUMMERS.

39:40.746 --> 39:42.107
SHE HAS
A DAIRY FARM.

39:42.107 --> 39:43.549
DID YOU MILK
ANYTHING?

39:43.549 --> 39:45.191
NO.

39:45.191 --> 39:48.394
MOSTLY SAT IN MY ROOM
WRITING TO YOU.

39:48.394 --> 39:49.995
OH.

39:49.995 --> 39:52.918
SO, JOFFREY‐‐
FINAL VERDICT?

39:52.918 --> 39:54.200
CUTTHROAT.

39:54.200 --> 39:56.202
LOTS OF GIRLS
WANT TO BE SEEN.

39:56.202 --> 39:59.004
BUT I WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO'D READ "THE ART OF WAR."

39:59.004 --> 40:01.006
‐ SO.
‐ WOW.

40:01.006 --> 40:04.610
HAD SOME GOOD TEACHERS.

40:04.610 --> 40:06.332
LEARNED THINGS.

40:06.332 --> 40:08.574
GOOD.

40:08.574 --> 40:10.936
SO.

40:10.936 --> 40:12.698
SO...

40:12.698 --> 40:15.501
DO YOU WANT TO
TAKE A BATH?

40:19.024 --> 40:21.227
I JUST‐‐
THAT WAS A JOKE.

40:21.227 --> 40:23.469
I'M‐‐ I'M STANDING
BY A BATHTUB, SO...

40:23.469 --> 40:24.950
‐ I GET IT.
‐ ... I DIDN'T
REALLY MEAN‐‐

40:24.950 --> 40:27.633
‐ SURE. RIGHT.
‐ I JUST SAID IT.

40:27.633 --> 40:29.355
‐ A JOKE.
‐ FUNNY.

40:31.237 --> 40:32.718
ARE YOU GONNA
ROB ME?

40:32.718 --> 40:35.921
‐ WHAT?
‐ THE OUTFIT LOOKS
FAIRLY MENACING.

40:37.162 --> 40:38.484
OH. SORRY.

40:38.484 --> 40:41.247
I FORGOT I WAS‐‐

40:41.247 --> 40:43.489
JUST TRYING TO KEEP

40:43.489 --> 40:45.371
A LOW PROFILE
FOR THE MOMENT.

40:45.371 --> 40:46.692
I RESPECT THAT.

40:49.054 --> 40:51.497
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU.

40:51.497 --> 40:53.259
ARE YOU?

40:53.259 --> 40:55.301
YEP.

40:55.301 --> 40:57.863
GOOD.

41:00.346 --> 41:03.349
OTHERWISE, ALL THOSE
E‐MAILS YOU SENT ME

41:03.349 --> 41:05.511
WOULD HAVE SEEMED
A LITTLE WEIRD.

<i>( door opens )</i>

41:18.444 --> 41:19.485
OH.

41:23.289 --> 41:24.690
HEY, KID.

41:26.692 --> 41:28.694
I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE BACK.

41:28.694 --> 41:30.696
YEAH, ME TOO.

41:38.103 --> 41:39.305
CAN I CRASH
HERE TONIGHT?

41:41.106 --> 41:42.308
YEAH, WHY NOT?

<i>( piano playing )</i>

42:01.607 --> 42:03.609
<i>( song ends )</i>

42:12.738 --> 42:14.300
I MAY WANT TO GO
BACK TO PERFORMING.

42:14.300 --> 42:16.582
I MAY WANT TO
TAKE MORE TIME OFF.

42:16.582 --> 42:18.424
I MAY MOVE BACK
TO NEW YORK.

42:18.424 --> 42:19.825
SOMEDAY.

42:19.825 --> 42:22.668
I MAY THROW POTS AND BUILD
A KILN OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE.

42:22.668 --> 42:23.949
FINE.

42:23.949 --> 42:25.511
FINE.

42:25.511 --> 42:26.432
FINE.

42:26.432 --> 42:28.514
SO, IF YOU'RE
NOT BUSY,

42:28.514 --> 42:30.155
I'D LIKE YOUR
OPINION ON SOMETHING.

42:34.159 --> 42:36.161
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
TELL THE ANGRY VILLAGERS?

42:36.161 --> 42:37.843
THAT YOU ARE BACK,
AND IF THEY DON'T LIKE IT,

42:37.843 --> 42:39.285
THEY ARE FREE TO
TAKE THEIR CHILDREN

42:39.285 --> 42:40.526
TO THAT ENORMOUS
CRAZY WOMAN

42:40.526 --> 42:42.448
WITH THE PYRAMID SYSTEM,

42:42.448 --> 42:44.089
WHOSE STUDENTS END UP
WITH KNOCK‐KNEES

42:44.089 --> 42:46.171
AND POST‐TRAUMATIC
STRESS DISORDER.

42:49.094 --> 42:51.176
TRULY?

42:51.176 --> 42:53.779
NOW, I'M DOING A DANCE
FOR THE FALL RECITAL.

42:53.779 --> 42:55.461
IT'S A LITTLE
DIFFERENT FOR ME,

42:55.461 --> 42:57.383
AND I WANT TO KNOW
IF YOU THINK IT'S
WORKING.

42:57.383 --> 42:58.984
‐ SURE.
‐ OKAY.
