00:00.010 --> 00:02.760
- Cheers.
- I admire you.

00:06.480 --> 00:08.990
- Nothing happened.
- Be careful, Jane.

00:09.040 --> 00:11.710
Before I got this job, I
was an outpatient here.

00:11.760 --> 00:14.110
- Who's that with Eddie and Julie-Ann?
- A new player.

00:14.160 --> 00:16.750
All we know is on the
street he's known as Oz.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.790
He kept a tally book.

00:18.840 --> 00:23.160
Now this Tod. Had quite the party on the
thirteenth, on the day Julie-Ann died.

00:24.840 --> 00:27.950
'She was last seen climbing
into a red Jaguar.'

00:28.000 --> 00:29.710
I don't usually drink that much.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.750
Guv? You need to see this.

00:31.800 --> 00:35.350
You think I'm guilty? My own daughter.
You think I'm capable of this?

00:35.400 --> 00:37.150
After you picked Julie-Ann
up from Homerton Hospital,

00:37.200 --> 00:38.510
where did you drive her?

00:38.560 --> 00:40.670
Sir.

00:40.720 --> 00:44.270
They locked her in here. This is a cell.

00:44.320 --> 00:49.430
George? George?! What's going on?

You heard he's out today?

02:34.880 --> 02:36.400
I heard.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.310
We should send a welcoming
party to his house.

02:39.360 --> 02:42.960
- These aren't the old days.
- They will be for Clifford Bentley.

03:07.040 --> 03:13.520
So, where were you between the hours
of six and midnight on Sunday 13th May?

03:15.360 --> 03:16.690
I've already told you.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.870
My wife and I were having
dinner with Daniel Zimmerman,

03:19.920 --> 03:22.070
the quality control manager at my company.

03:22.120 --> 03:26.070
Well, Mr Zimmerman claims you
left his house shortly after 10pm.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.720
Did you go straight home?

03:28.600 --> 03:30.600
Yes, we did.

03:32.280 --> 03:35.670
And on 1st May, did you pick
Julie-Ann up from Homerton Hospital

03:35.720 --> 03:37.520
and take her back to your house?

03:38.600 --> 03:40.800
I picked her up, yes...

03:43.160 --> 03:46.630
.. but only to take her back to the
estate in Hackney where she was staying.

03:48.180 --> 03:49.030
What?

03:49.080 --> 03:52.280
Sir, DC Hudson called. He's
finished the house-to-house.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.950
The next-door neighbour
claims she saw a man

04:02.000 --> 04:06.510
matching Eddie Phillips' description
visit the Collins' house two nights ago.

04:06.560 --> 04:08.120
Thanks.

04:16.760 --> 04:18.760
All yours. She's bricking it.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.750
Morgan.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.270
Yeah?

04:23.320 --> 04:25.640
You wanna take the lead on this one?

04:26.360 --> 04:28.750
- Me?
- Yeah, you're good with her.

04:28.800 --> 04:32.190
Between you and me, Bradfield wants
to recommend you for a TDC post.

04:32.240 --> 04:37.440
You don't clear up six burglaries in one
day without flashing on someone's radar.

04:42.640 --> 04:48.600
Mrs Collins, where were you on
the evening of Sunday 13th May?

04:49.520 --> 04:52.270
I was out to dinner with my husband.

04:52.320 --> 04:54.590
And on 1st May?

04:54.640 --> 04:57.390
I know you've already
spoken to the clubhouse.

04:57.440 --> 05:01.720
I was at a charity golf match
at the Royal Blackheath.

05:03.760 --> 05:06.960
When you got home, was Julie-Ann there?

05:07.760 --> 05:12.160
I didn't go straight home. I went
to my sister's and I stayed there.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.600
Today is supposed to be a day of
reflection, not interrogation.

05:19.840 --> 05:23.120
- So Eddie just showed up?
- I never met him before.

05:24.200 --> 05:28.350
He came looking for money. He said he'd
keep coming back so I gave him some.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.800
How much?

05:30.720 --> 05:33.750
I don't know. Eight, nine pounds?
Whatever I had in my wallet.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.960
- And why did he target you?
- I didn't ask.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.960
- I just wanted to get rid of him.
- And now he's missing.

05:41.720 --> 05:45.320
That doesn't explain why you
locked your daughter in that room.

05:45.680 --> 05:46.990
I didn't.

05:47.040 --> 05:50.230
We have her fingerprints
on the inside of that door.

05:50.280 --> 05:55.150
Red fibres found on Julie-Ann's socks match
the samples we took from the rug in that room.

05:55.200 --> 05:59.670
I don't deny that Julie-Ann used to stay in that
room, but she hasn't been home since last year.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.360
There was blood on the mattress.

06:04.160 --> 06:06.480
Maybe someone had a nosebleed.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.520
A nosebleed?

06:24.440 --> 06:26.390
- Keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir.

06:26.440 --> 06:28.910
Why have we still not
found Eddie Phillips?

06:28.960 --> 06:33.310
Post some more wooden tops in a car outside
the Pembridge Estate, speak to informants.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.150
Do something. I want him found.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.200
Yes, sir.

06:38.880 --> 06:42.950
Teresa O'Duncie claims Julie-Ann
demanded money from her father

06:43.000 --> 06:46.750
and now George Collins says Eddie
tried to get money out of him.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.950
Julie-Ann's posh accent. I mean,
he knew her old man was well-off.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.950
Or he knew he was a pushover.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.470
Sir, the photos from the Drug Squad
surveillance of Dwayne Clarke.

06:55.520 --> 06:58.510
- I've checked them against the log.
- What are you doing now?

06:58.560 --> 06:59.830
Sir?

06:59.880 --> 07:03.430
Can you go to Barclays and pick up
George Collins' bank statements, please?

07:03.480 --> 07:06.920
Yes, sir. Of course. Bank statements.

You're a mess.

07:56.360 --> 08:00.350

couple of weeks. It's been months.

Sir, can I... sit in?

09:03.960 --> 09:06.640
- I'm not sure that's appropriate.
- Because?

09:09.200 --> 09:11.500
If I could stand at the back and observe.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.360
Two withdrawals. £250 each
on the 1st and 2nd May.

09:28.240 --> 09:30.750
I do my company's payroll
on the 1st of each month.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.350
So why withdraw another £250 on the 2nd?

09:33.400 --> 09:36.760
There was some overtime
that I hadn't factored in.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.040
Seize the company accounts.

09:50.960 --> 09:55.480
On the 1st, Julie-Ann phoned me
in tears, begging for some money.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.950
Her boyfriend had run up a debt
and was in a spot of trouble.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.670
500 quid?

10:04.720 --> 10:06.360
50.

10:07.120 --> 10:11.440
That's how much I gave her. It's the
boyfriend that you need to talk to.

10:12.400 --> 10:16.310
Some... deal he and
Julie-Ann were involved in.

10:16.360 --> 10:19.560
- When he came to see me
he wanted more. - What deal?

10:20.640 --> 10:22.640
I didn't ask. I didn't wanna know.

10:23.920 --> 10:28.030
Just another one of his lies. Some
make-believe story about a wizard.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.080
- Oz?
- Yes.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.480
I was just trying to help my daughter.

11:08.680 --> 11:10.910
Anything?

11:10.960 --> 11:14.590
She insists the day Julie-Ann was picked
up from Homerton, she never saw her.

11:14.640 --> 11:16.640
She was at her sister's, apparently.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.990
We need to find this Oz, if this is
all about a drug deal that went south.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.790
Maybe that's why Eddie and
Julie-Ann were beaten up.

11:25.840 --> 11:30.030
Or a robbery? Julie-Ann had 50 quid on
her when George dropped her at the estate.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.550
We've only got his word for it.

11:31.600 --> 11:34.440
We know he locked her in
that room, but for how long?

11:35.480 --> 11:39.680
Maybe something happened to her when
they got back from that dinner party.

11:43.680 --> 11:48.320
When Eddie went to Homerton Hospital
with Julie-Ann, did he have crutches?

11:50.600 --> 11:53.200
According to Teresa
O'Duncie's statement...

11:54.080 --> 11:55.680
.. he did, yeah.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.040
But Julie-Ann's injuries...?

11:59.080 --> 12:00.880
Julie-Ann didn't have them then.

12:04.600 --> 12:08.360
So we were wrong. Julie-Ann wasn't
beaten at the same time as Eddie.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.560
So where'd she get those injuries from?

12:34.880 --> 12:36.380
About bloody time.

12:39.460 --> 12:41.130
Good to see you, mate.

12:41.180 --> 12:45.210
- You on your own?
- Ma's at home, baking you a cake.

12:45.260 --> 12:47.250
I ain't been punished enough?

12:56.980 --> 12:58.980
Whoo! Let's get you out of here.

13:00.260 --> 13:04.500
- How are the preparations coming along?
- Slow but steady, cos of the alarm.

13:05.860 --> 13:08.460
We'll get through the
dividing wall tonight.

13:09.540 --> 13:13.290
Make sure your ex don't come out of the
woodwork once she gets a whiff of the money.

13:13.340 --> 13:16.040
She'll have to find me on
the Costa del Sol first.

13:17.900 --> 13:20.450
- How much is it?
- A cool plum.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.890
100 grand.

13:21.940 --> 13:24.690
Stash money from one of Whiteley's rivals.

13:24.740 --> 13:27.570
And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

13:27.620 --> 13:30.010
We keep 40 per cent of whatever we get.

13:30.060 --> 13:31.340
Only 40?

13:34.980 --> 13:37.780
Do this right, this job'll
put us back on the map.

13:55.340 --> 14:00.100
You have an answer for everything, Mr
Collins. So let me get your take on this.

14:04.300 --> 14:06.330
During the search of your property,

14:06.380 --> 14:10.650
my officers found a golf club beneath
your stairs with blood and hair on it.

14:10.700 --> 14:15.780
Forensics will examine that hair and
check the blood type against Julie-Ann's.

14:25.580 --> 14:29.020
God, when I picked her up,
I barely recognised her.

14:31.020 --> 14:33.020
She looked awful... sick.

14:38.140 --> 14:40.140
She said she wanted to get clean.

14:41.660 --> 14:44.760
What could I do? I agreed she
could stay in her old room.

14:46.300 --> 14:50.970
When Mary came home from playing golf,
I was making Julie-Ann some soup.

14:51.020 --> 14:55.530
It just upset Mary so much to see her like
that, she went to stay at her sister's.

14:55.580 --> 14:57.730
Jump to where you locked her in that room.

14:57.780 --> 15:01.940
She asked me to put a padlock on
the door. She said it would help.

15:02.700 --> 15:08.610
So while Julie-Ann ate lunch, I put a
bolt on the door and then I left her.

15:08.660 --> 15:10.660
I went downstairs.

15:11.660 --> 15:17.780
Hours later, I heard her
kicking... and screaming.

15:21.660 --> 15:23.660
I didn't know what to do.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.300
And then it went quiet.

15:28.980 --> 15:31.180
I went upstairs to check on her.

15:34.340 --> 15:38.420
She was on the bed...
with a needle, about to...

15:43.580 --> 15:46.500
- Why didn't I check the bag?
- The golf club, George.

15:48.500 --> 15:51.490
She went mad, like a wild animal.

15:51.540 --> 15:54.240
She attacked me, pushed
me over, ran downstairs.

15:55.980 --> 15:57.810
Tearing the house up.

15:57.860 --> 16:00.450
Whenever Julie-Ann came
home, I'd hide the valuables.

16:00.500 --> 16:03.010
But she saw the payroll money and took it.

16:03.060 --> 16:05.060
She was opening the front door...

16:09.180 --> 16:11.680
Mary had left her golf
clubs in the hallway.

16:13.020 --> 16:15.020
I don't think I planned to hit her.

16:16.340 --> 16:18.220
But I did, several times.

16:19.540 --> 16:21.540
She was just...

16:22.420 --> 16:24.420
She was lying there, not moving.

16:25.460 --> 16:27.460
You didn't call her an ambulance?

16:33.620 --> 16:37.850
I, er... carried her back
upstairs to her bedroom,

16:37.900 --> 16:40.500
and went to the bathroom
to get the first-aid.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.650
But when I came back, she was gone.

16:43.700 --> 16:48.530
The front door was open and Julie-Ann
was nowhere in sight. The money's gone.

16:48.580 --> 16:52.860
And Eddie... he knew you'd beaten
her? That's why he blackmailed you?

16:58.060 --> 17:00.060
How long was Mary at her sister's?

17:01.060 --> 17:03.170
Er...

17:03.220 --> 17:08.220
I telephoned her, she came back
home. So er... two, three hours.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.930
Only, your wife's sister told
us that on Wednesday 1st May,

17:11.980 --> 17:13.859
she didn't see you or Mary.

17:33.980 --> 17:36.050
Just taking it all in.

17:36.100 --> 17:38.260
Never thought I'd miss this.

17:39.660 --> 17:41.690
- Oh, bloody hell.
- What?

17:41.740 --> 17:46.420
The stupid cow just needs to add
"jailbird" and the world and his wife knows.

17:55.180 --> 17:56.970
Come on. Come on, let's go inside.

17:57.020 --> 17:59.010
- That Nick's missus?
- Uh-huh.

17:59.060 --> 18:01.940
What's her problem? I've done my time.

18:02.980 --> 18:06.260
- So who's here, then?
- Just a few of the usual suspects.

18:14.380 --> 18:15.740
Hello, love.

18:17.100 --> 18:19.100
Tell 'em he'll be right in.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.140
Didn't want them to see me cry.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.980
I knew I would.

18:30.660 --> 18:33.010
I know, it ain't been easy.

18:33.060 --> 18:34.340
No, it ain't.

18:35.700 --> 18:38.100
Things are gonna be different. Promise.

18:39.860 --> 18:42.560
You think I'm stupid
enough to get caught again?

18:43.340 --> 18:45.130
Come on, better go in.

18:45.180 --> 18:47.580
They can wait a while longer.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.540
What did you think of the banner?

19:05.260 --> 19:07.930
- I hate it.
- Knew you would.

19:11.220 --> 19:13.690
And the screws didn't know
who was doing it, did they?

19:13.740 --> 19:15.730
Didn't have a bloody clue!

19:15.780 --> 19:17.490
Here, when did you get out?

19:17.540 --> 19:19.210
Cake?

19:19.260 --> 19:22.260
- Day before you did, didn't I?
- I made it myself. Sure?

19:23.340 --> 19:25.340
Would you like some cake?

19:26.660 --> 19:29.410
- Here, darling, bit of cake.
- I'm all right, thanks.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.410
Danny, Danny, have a bit of cake.

19:31.460 --> 19:33.330
I made it myself.

19:33.380 --> 19:35.250
Would you like a bit of cake?

19:35.300 --> 19:37.290
♪ Don't go round tonight

19:37.340 --> 19:39.170
♪ It's bound to take your life...

19:39.220 --> 19:41.850
It was a good setup. Good setup.

19:41.900 --> 19:44.250
No way! No way.

19:51.620 --> 19:53.620
There you are!

19:57.380 --> 19:59.380
You not in the mood for a party?

20:01.260 --> 20:03.890
- Are you pleased he's back?
- Course I am.

20:03.940 --> 20:06.260
What kind of question is that?

20:07.460 --> 20:09.930
No matter whatever happens,
Ma, I'll look after you.

20:09.980 --> 20:12.900
- I can look after myself, thank you.
- I'm serious.

20:14.380 --> 20:18.500
You can do better than him. Don't know
why you've stuck with him all these years.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.220
He's your father.

20:23.900 --> 20:26.000
He'd better not mess you about again.

20:31.740 --> 20:33.740
Come up when you're ready.

20:50.220 --> 20:52.220
Do you recognise this?

20:54.660 --> 20:58.060
This is from a set of ladies'
golf clubs we found at your house.

21:00.380 --> 21:02.380
Then it's probably mine.

21:03.180 --> 21:07.300
Your husband confessed to using this
golf club to beat your daughter with.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.900
Oh, God in heaven.

21:12.900 --> 21:14.730
Oh, George!

21:14.780 --> 21:16.780
We found her blood on it.

21:18.460 --> 21:23.700
We believe this was used in a brutal attack
on your daughter in your home on 1st May.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.500
What will happen to him?

21:28.420 --> 21:30.140
Nothing.

21:32.100 --> 21:35.420
When we dusted it for
fingerprints, we only found yours.

21:41.060 --> 21:43.450
George told us what happened.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.700
You weren't at your sister's, we checked.

21:53.940 --> 21:55.940
I was trying to stop her!

21:57.820 --> 21:59.250
For her own good!

21:59.300 --> 22:01.490
By hitting her with this?

22:01.540 --> 22:03.860
Do you have any children, Mr Bradfield?

22:05.740 --> 22:10.900
You don't know what it's like to have
a daughter who takes that poison...

22:12.380 --> 22:15.140
.. and destroys the life you've given her.

22:16.420 --> 22:18.420
I couldn't let her leave.

22:20.620 --> 22:22.620
How many times did you hit her?

22:29.900 --> 22:31.900
Yes, I hit her.

22:34.300 --> 22:36.300
But I didn't kill her!

22:43.020 --> 22:44.850
No.

22:44.900 --> 22:48.260
But by lying to us, you're
helping the bastard who did.

22:48.860 --> 22:51.500
Anything you've held back?

22:53.260 --> 22:55.260
Anything.

23:01.300 --> 23:03.300
Her bag.

23:06.220 --> 23:08.220
She left it behind.

23:12.300 --> 23:14.300
It was a tatty old thing...

23:17.300 --> 23:19.300
.. but I kept it...

23:21.220 --> 23:23.220
.. in case she ever came back.

23:26.980 --> 23:28.610
All right, darling?

23:28.660 --> 23:30.660
Yeah. You all right, darling?

23:31.540 --> 23:32.930
Great party.

23:32.980 --> 23:35.490
Hey, Dad. Do you want to go?

23:35.540 --> 23:38.370
- Yeah.
- Your brother's leaving.

23:38.420 --> 23:39.970
Oh, great to see you, Lenny boy.

23:40.020 --> 23:41.690
- Anything. Anything.
- Yeah.

23:41.740 --> 23:44.530
I might take you up on that kind offer.

23:44.580 --> 23:49.970
Did you hear that? Anything I want,
as long as it ain't more than ten bob!

23:50.020 --> 23:51.570
The tight bastard!

23:51.620 --> 23:52.770
No change there, then.

23:52.820 --> 23:54.810
- Come here.
- Oh, get off!

24:00.660 --> 24:01.810
Whoo!

24:01.860 --> 24:04.260
- I'm spilling my drink!
- Never mind that.

24:07.500 --> 24:09.180
- You silly old sod.
- Here...

24:11.180 --> 24:14.930
- Let's have a night on the town, eh?
- I've got to sort this mess out.

24:14.980 --> 24:17.300
Ah, the boys will clear this up.

24:18.260 --> 24:21.130
Where's David? Why wasn't he here?

24:21.180 --> 24:22.770
He went out.

24:22.820 --> 24:26.460
- You what? - Who's paying
for this night on the town?

24:27.460 --> 24:29.820
John, fetch me a hammer.

24:34.940 --> 24:36.780
What are you doing?

24:43.140 --> 24:46.290
- Where's the box?
- What box?

24:46.340 --> 24:49.130
There was one and a half
grand in it. Where is it?

24:49.180 --> 24:50.410
I don't know.

24:50.460 --> 24:52.730
Where's the money? Tell me!

24:52.780 --> 24:55.370
- Dad. - I haven't touched
your money. I don't know.

24:55.420 --> 24:57.090
Then why don't I believe you?

24:57.140 --> 25:01.330
You hid it under our noses
when we're barely scraping by?

25:01.380 --> 25:04.060
It was for all of us, for when I got out.

25:05.100 --> 25:08.570
Well, what's happened to it?
One of you must've taken it!

25:08.620 --> 25:12.490
The Old Bill turned the flat
upside down. They must've taken it.

25:12.540 --> 25:14.540
Yeah, they took everything else.

25:17.900 --> 25:20.020
Thieving bastards!

25:20.620 --> 25:22.420
Sign here and here, sir.

25:29.060 --> 25:31.060
Thank you.

25:37.780 --> 25:41.300
- Please find who killed her.
- We're doing all we can.

25:56.140 --> 25:58.450
They're devastated.

25:58.500 --> 26:02.100
I just hope we're doing the
right thing by letting them go.

26:13.220 --> 26:17.210
Julie-Ann had 250 quid on her
in new, traceable bank notes.

26:17.260 --> 26:21.300
George Collins inferred that Julie-Ann
and Eddie were doing a deal with Oz.

26:22.260 --> 26:23.820
We need to find this Oz.

26:25.140 --> 26:27.340
Then Eddie could be telling the truth.

26:28.540 --> 26:31.300
So this Oz... Could it be him?

26:32.340 --> 26:35.410
Which means Eddie is the direct
link between Julie-Ann and Oz.

26:35.460 --> 26:36.490
Maybe.

26:36.540 --> 26:40.770
This day wouldn't be so bad if we could have
at least charged the parents with something.

26:40.820 --> 26:42.570
What, so you can sleep easier?

26:42.620 --> 26:47.130
- They've been through enough.
- They confessed to beating their
daughter and gave us the runaround.

26:47.180 --> 26:49.250
GBH, perverting the course of justice...

26:49.300 --> 26:52.000
Yeah, well, we all know you
haven't got kids, mate.

26:53.900 --> 26:55.900
Great.

27:03.380 --> 27:07.820
Public Order Act 1936.
Chapter on unlawful meetings.

27:08.700 --> 27:10.700
You know you've got ketchup on it?

27:15.780 --> 27:18.180
What's going on between you and Bradfield?

27:19.340 --> 27:20.570
Nothing.

27:20.620 --> 27:22.330
Nothing's going on.

27:22.380 --> 27:25.170
Are you trying to end your
career before it's even started?

27:25.220 --> 27:27.890
They're like dogs, they
like being stroked.

27:27.940 --> 27:32.380
- But for God's sake, don't let 'em hump
your leg. - I'm not. Nothing happened.

27:41.140 --> 27:44.040
- Mind if I join you handsome chaps?
- More the merrier.

27:44.820 --> 27:47.330
Good work today, Morgan,
with the girl's mother.

27:47.380 --> 27:50.250
- Seriously?
- We'll make a WDC of you yet.

27:50.300 --> 27:53.410
- This beef's tough.
- That's lamb.

27:53.460 --> 27:57.450
Right, Uniforms are back from the
Collins' house with Julie-Ann's bag.

27:57.500 --> 28:00.900
Lawrence is going through the
contents now for Forensics.

28:03.340 --> 28:06.370
Sort my tray out, will
you, Morgan? Tennison?

28:06.420 --> 28:09.700
Someone needs to enter the
property in the exhibits book.

28:14.380 --> 28:18.890
This is Julie-Ann's bag that we found
in the shed at the rear of the property.

28:18.940 --> 28:21.810
Bit of a rocker, by the looks of it.

28:21.860 --> 28:24.690
Slade at the Forum. David
Bowie at Earls Court.

28:24.740 --> 28:26.180
What's that on the back?

28:30.260 --> 28:34.060
Dwayne Clarke sold drugs to
TOD on the day Julie-Ann died.

28:36.060 --> 28:39.260
Hm. Maybe he was a part of Eddie
and Julie-Ann's drug deal.

28:39.780 --> 28:42.090
Get on to the GPO, get an
address for that number.

28:42.140 --> 28:43.290
Sir.

28:43.340 --> 28:44.940
Len?

28:45.860 --> 28:47.290
A quick word?

28:47.340 --> 28:52.970
Before you say anything, Jim, I've thought
about it and er... I've had a change of heart.

28:53.020 --> 28:55.220
Good. It would only make things worse.

28:58.980 --> 29:00.460
What?

29:01.460 --> 29:03.660
Some gossip going round the station.

29:04.260 --> 29:07.700
You and my probationer.
Thought you should know.

29:08.500 --> 29:09.860
Thanks.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.620
Sir?

29:27.100 --> 29:28.930
Can we...?

29:32.660 --> 29:34.740
Sorry, I'll... I'll let you get home.

29:35.780 --> 29:36.900
Hey.

29:45.700 --> 29:49.130
It appears we're the subject
of gossip in the station and...

29:49.180 --> 29:54.530
if it makes you feel awkward, I'll do
whatever I can to help facilitate a transfer.

29:54.580 --> 29:56.930
You want me to leave?

29:56.980 --> 30:00.420
- No, but we need to clean
the slate. - We will.

30:05.060 --> 30:06.660
Have a... Have a good night.

30:21.660 --> 30:26.090
- That money was supposed to see us through.
- Hey, don't worry.

30:26.140 --> 30:28.610
We'll be "seen through"
all right. Soon enough.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.890
Yeah, I know.

30:30.940 --> 30:32.650
You think Silas is gonna be a problem?

30:32.700 --> 30:35.170
He's been having a bit of a wobble.

30:35.220 --> 30:37.370
You might need to give
him some encouragement.

30:37.420 --> 30:39.420
I'll have a word.

30:41.820 --> 30:44.410
Oh, I've forgotten something.
You go on. I'll catch up.

30:44.460 --> 30:45.620
All right.

30:49.820 --> 30:54.530
Evening, Detective. What
brings you here? Are you lost?

30:54.580 --> 30:58.290
- I made a promise to Charlie
Hopkins' widow. - Which was?

30:58.340 --> 31:00.840
That you'd pin a hit-and-run
on an innocent man?

31:02.380 --> 31:03.650
Innocent?

31:03.700 --> 31:06.290
I was nowhere near that
copper when he snuffed it.

31:06.340 --> 31:08.770
You destroyed your car in a hurry.

31:08.820 --> 31:10.820
Just had to get rid, didn't I?

31:17.340 --> 31:19.340
Tread carefully, Bentley.

31:36.540 --> 31:37.970
Where's your brother?

31:38.020 --> 31:41.500
- Can't I trust you two to do anything?
- I told him to be here.

31:42.700 --> 31:45.770
It's too risky without a lookout. Come on.

31:45.820 --> 31:47.420
Better cancel tonight.

32:12.940 --> 32:16.180
- Is Oz in?
- Yeah, he's upstairs.

32:22.940 --> 32:27.050
Boss, that address from the GPO.

32:27.100 --> 32:30.730
The TOD number we found in Julie-Ann's
bag. It's from a phone box in Hackney.

32:30.780 --> 32:32.780
- A phone box?
- Yeah.

32:39.020 --> 32:40.810
What happened to you last night?

32:40.860 --> 32:42.860
Lost track of time.

32:46.260 --> 32:49.770
- I can't have you smoking that shit.
- But it helps dull the pain.

32:49.820 --> 32:51.020
Am I asking you?

32:52.340 --> 32:53.730
I've had enough.

32:53.780 --> 32:56.410
- All this between you and
your brother. - He left me.

32:56.460 --> 33:00.090
He didn't push you off that roof.
What happened was an accident.

33:00.140 --> 33:03.810
And that's all you've ever
had to say, innit, Dad?

33:03.860 --> 33:10.900
It's in the past. We are where we are, son, but
this job is the Bentley boys going big-time.

33:12.340 --> 33:15.050
So pull yourself together or you're out!

33:15.100 --> 33:16.300
Your choice.

33:21.220 --> 33:25.370
So either TOD comes here at a pre-arranged
time or he's someone in one of those houses.

33:25.420 --> 33:29.290
We'll draw up a surveillance schedule,
make enquiries with the local collator.

33:29.340 --> 33:30.820
Thanks.

33:38.060 --> 33:41.210
The woman who answered the door
to that house was high as a kite.

33:41.260 --> 33:42.850
Well, this is hippy central.

33:42.900 --> 33:45.810
There was a man passed out
behind her on the stairs.

33:45.860 --> 33:48.620
- Isn't the Homerton Drugs
Unit near here? - So?

33:50.740 --> 33:53.700
- What if TOD isn't a
name, but initials? - Yeah?

33:56.340 --> 33:58.810
- Sir? - Did you finish
the house-to-house?

33:58.860 --> 34:01.370
Just a thought. The
receptionist from the hospital.

34:01.420 --> 34:03.450
- What about her?
- T-O-D.

34:03.500 --> 34:06.170
T-O'D.

34:06.220 --> 34:09.370
- What are you on about, Tennison?
- Could it be Teresa O'Duncie?

34:09.420 --> 34:13.420
She already has connections to the case,
more specifically to drugs and users.

34:14.100 --> 34:15.900
Might be worth speaking to her.

34:17.620 --> 34:18.860
Let's go.

34:21.620 --> 34:24.219
Do you abbreviate your
name, Miss O'Duncie?

34:25.020 --> 34:26.420
What do you mean?

34:28.860 --> 34:31.420
T-O-D. Is that you?

34:33.900 --> 34:35.900
Do you recognise this number?

34:43.739 --> 34:47.250
That number is for a phone box on
the King Charles Road in Hackney,

34:47.300 --> 34:49.900
right around the corner
from where you work.

34:50.820 --> 34:53.120
What's your connection to that location?

34:54.380 --> 34:55.940
There ain't one.

35:00.620 --> 35:02.720
Do you know a man named Dwayne Clarke?

35:04.460 --> 35:07.450
- No. - Dwayne Clarke is
a well-connected lowlife

35:07.500 --> 35:11.330
who supplied drugs to someone
identified by the initials T-O-D

35:11.380 --> 35:13.680
on the day Julie-Ann Collins was killed.

35:14.700 --> 35:17.570
Julie-Ann had that flyer in her bag.

35:17.620 --> 35:19.330
It was you she was ringing.

35:19.380 --> 35:22.130
Don't waste my time, Miss O'Duncie.

35:22.180 --> 35:26.290
You stay on this track and I'll have you
charged and in court before the week is out.

35:26.340 --> 35:28.370
What for? I ain't done nothing!

35:28.420 --> 35:31.450
WPC Tennison, can you think of
anything we could charge her with?

35:31.500 --> 35:34.850
Conspiracy to pervert the course of
justice in a murder investigation.

35:34.900 --> 35:38.620
Spot-on! And that carries a life sentence.

35:41.380 --> 35:43.980
What were you doing
with Eddie and Julie-Ann?

35:46.180 --> 35:48.180
I help them.

35:51.060 --> 35:54.690
I didn't know this would
happen. I swear on my life.

35:54.740 --> 35:57.180
I-I-I-I...

36:03.020 --> 36:05.770
All right, Teresa. Breathe. Breathe.

36:05.820 --> 36:07.660
Deep, long breaths.

36:08.420 --> 36:10.860
Why is Julie-Ann calling
you at a phone box?

36:11.860 --> 36:13.610
It's not me.

36:13.660 --> 36:15.660
I try to help the poor angels.

36:20.540 --> 36:22.540
He's a dealer.

36:23.580 --> 36:27.330
The gear he sells is better than
the stuff they buy on the streets.

36:27.380 --> 36:30.170
- All I've ever done is help them.
- The hospital helps them!

36:30.220 --> 36:33.130
What you do is poison
them, you twisted cow!

36:33.180 --> 36:35.580
This dealer. What's his name, then?

36:40.620 --> 36:45.210
All right. I'm arresting you for
conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

36:45.260 --> 36:47.210
The dealer, what is his name?

36:53.940 --> 36:58.410
Get her cautioned and booked in
downstairs for further questioning.

36:58.460 --> 37:00.460
It's my brother, Terry.

37:02.580 --> 37:04.580
But everyone calls him Oz.

37:14.300 --> 37:16.130
All right, listen up.

37:16.180 --> 37:21.210
Our target is Terrence O'Duncie, AKA Oz.

37:21.260 --> 37:24.050
One previous arrest five
years ago for dealing heroin.

37:24.100 --> 37:27.690
He operates out of a squat
on King Charles Road, Hackney.

37:27.740 --> 37:29.050
Where's Morgan?

37:29.100 --> 37:32.250
Case conference at solicitors'
department for Kenneth Boyle.

37:32.300 --> 37:35.860
- There could be women and children, so
we need a plonk. - Plonk's ready, sir.

37:40.980 --> 37:42.060
Good.

37:55.460 --> 37:57.460
I don't want you to leave.

38:00.660 --> 38:02.260
In fact, it's er...

38:03.060 --> 38:05.020
It's the last thing that I want.

38:06.980 --> 38:09.700
- Good.
- Just so you know.

38:15.180 --> 38:17.180
Not that I was planning on leaving.

38:18.860 --> 38:21.860
- Just so THAT you know.
- Good.

38:41.780 --> 38:43.780
Good to see you again, Mr Bentley.

38:48.580 --> 38:51.880
I see you ain't bothered to
decorate since I was last here.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.130
Times have been tough.

38:54.180 --> 38:56.260
My heart bleeds for you, Silas.

38:57.620 --> 38:59.620
I trust you've changed the oil.

39:07.140 --> 39:09.140
Your family well?

39:10.100 --> 39:12.100
John said they've gone on ahead.

39:13.780 --> 39:16.890
Eleni hates flying, so they went by boat.

39:16.940 --> 39:19.090
They arrived yesterday.

39:19.140 --> 39:21.340
Kolossi village, right?

39:22.900 --> 39:25.650
Now remind me, where is that?

39:25.700 --> 39:26.860
South?

39:30.100 --> 39:32.100
Yes. Near Limassol.

39:34.020 --> 39:35.700
You look nervous, Silas.

39:39.820 --> 39:43.540
I miss my family. I want
to leave to join them.

39:49.780 --> 39:52.490
You can keep the caf
closed. If anybody asks...

39:52.540 --> 39:54.100
Silas, Silas.

39:57.540 --> 39:59.380
I fancy a nice cup of tea.

40:00.380 --> 40:02.180
How about you?

40:05.900 --> 40:07.420
How long you been here?

40:08.580 --> 40:10.530
18 years.

40:10.580 --> 40:13.700
And in that time, have
you ever been closed?

40:15.740 --> 40:17.170
No.

40:17.220 --> 40:19.650
No...

40:19.700 --> 40:23.250
If you leave for Cyprus,
people'll get suspicious.

40:23.300 --> 40:25.410
In three days, you'll be rich.

40:25.460 --> 40:30.220
And then you can fuck off back to
Kolossi and see Eleni and the kids.

40:38.860 --> 40:40.660
Let's get this show on the road.

40:50.540 --> 40:52.930
Have you ever done
something like this before?

40:52.980 --> 40:56.740
Just keep your wits about you,
Jane, you'll be all right, OK?

41:06.500 --> 41:08.100
On your word, sir.

41:14.300 --> 41:17.130
Go upstairs with Uniform, see
if anyone knows the victim.

41:17.180 --> 41:19.810
Police! Where's Terrence O'Duncie?

41:19.860 --> 41:21.570
Where's O'Duncie?

41:21.620 --> 41:23.620
Dunno, man. Upstairs?

41:26.580 --> 41:28.220
Stop!

41:28.900 --> 41:32.300
Obviously you haven't got to
the chapter on hepatitis yet.

41:40.580 --> 41:42.580
We're through! Give me a hand.

41:46.660 --> 41:49.060
Plans are right. That's the alarmed mesh.

41:53.460 --> 41:54.850
Get off!

41:54.900 --> 41:56.890
Get 'em out, yeah?

41:56.940 --> 41:58.930
Boys and girls, come on!

41:58.980 --> 42:00.980
Move yourselves.

42:47.700 --> 42:50.730
- Shall I?
- Yeah.

42:50.780 --> 42:52.660
Yeah. Do it.

43:18.380 --> 43:20.380
That's one down, eh?

43:22.060 --> 43:24.060
- Move it!
- All right, I'm going.

43:26.660 --> 43:28.930
Must be 40 or 50 junkies living here.

43:28.980 --> 43:31.250
There's two young 'uns downstairs asleep.

43:31.300 --> 43:34.330
- One is still in nappies.
- Get Social Services and an ambulance.

43:34.380 --> 43:36.380
- He's up here.
- The scum.

43:43.620 --> 43:46.370
- Police! Nobody move!
- Jesus!

43:46.420 --> 43:48.810
- Get her out of here.
- Get dressed. Come on.

43:48.860 --> 43:52.900
What the hell's going on? You
can't just come kicking down doors!

43:52.900 --> 43:54.810
Terrence O'Duncie? Come with us.

43:54.860 --> 43:57.450
- What's this about?
- The murder of Julie-Ann Collins.

43:57.500 --> 44:01.410
You're joking? All right. What's it
gonna take for you lot to get lost?

44:01.960 --> 44:02.970
Huh?

44:03.020 --> 44:05.020
Look, I know how this goes.

44:05.700 --> 44:07.530
I know how to keep my trap shut.

44:07.580 --> 44:09.980
- 125?
- You what?

44:10.900 --> 44:13.050
300, then. Split it between you.

44:13.100 --> 44:14.950
You piggies can buy yourselves
something nice. Yeah (?)

44:15.000 --> 44:18.400
Oi, get your filthy fucking
pig hands off my jacket!

44:20.740 --> 44:21.890
Spence!

44:21.940 --> 44:23.730
Come here! Come here!

44:23.780 --> 44:25.300
Yeah? Right with me.

44:26.940 --> 44:28.540
- Get off me!
- Spence!

44:30.060 --> 44:31.490
- Come on!
- I'll kill ya!

44:31.540 --> 44:33.580
All right! All right!

44:34.860 --> 44:36.580
Yeah?

44:37.300 --> 44:40.000
What are you still doing
here? Get down to the car!

44:40.660 --> 44:42.660
You didn't see anything. All right?

44:45.580 --> 44:47.580
You saw it. He went for me.
