WEBVTT

00:14.931 --> 00:16.222
What's going on?

00:16.433 --> 00:18.517
Well, my eye is a little itchy.

00:19.728 --> 00:22.396
Uh, mine too. Yeah.

00:23.273 --> 00:26.400
Wow, it's really red.
You should go see my eye doctor.

00:26.651 --> 00:28.944
Richard?
I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend.

00:29.154 --> 00:31.822
Richard, that's all I ever hear.
Richard, Richard, Richard.

00:33.158 --> 00:35.784
Since we've been going out,
I think I've mentioned his name twice.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.911
Okay. So Richard, Richard.

00:39.414 --> 00:42.291
It's not Richard, okay?
It's this new guy. He's really good.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.169
I'm sorry. I'm not going to an eye doctor.

00:45.378 --> 00:48.422
- Oh, God. Here we go.
- What?

00:48.590 --> 00:52.259
Any time anything comes close
to touching her eye or anyone else's...

00:52.469 --> 00:54.553
...she, like, freaks out. Watch.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.430
Ross, come on.

00:56.681 --> 01:00.225
All right, fine. I have a weird thing with
my eye. Can we not talk about it please?

01:00.435 --> 01:01.894
All right.

01:03.063 --> 01:06.440
Hey, Rach. You know that great song?
Um, "Me, myself and eye."

01:06.608 --> 01:08.442
Aah! Monica. Come on.

01:08.651 --> 01:11.528
Does anyone wanna get some lunch?
All those in favor, say "eye."

01:11.738 --> 01:13.197
Ross, stop it. Come on.

01:13.406 --> 01:16.325
How much did I love
The King and "Eye."

01:16.534 --> 01:18.660
- Chandler.
- Me too, me too.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.080
Just stop it. That's enough. Come on.

01:22.665 --> 01:25.626
- You okay there, man?
- Yeah. I got too excited.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.346
All right, I gotta go.
I'm taking Ben to the park.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.515
- Oh, give him a kiss for me.
- All right. Bye.

02:21.683 --> 02:22.808
- Bye.
- Bye.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.476
Later.

02:25.019 --> 02:27.855
I am so sorry you got caught
in the middle of that.

02:28.064 --> 02:31.817
I didn't mean to be so out there,
but I am furious with him.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.237
Wow, um...

02:35.738 --> 02:37.030
Calm down?

02:38.658 --> 02:41.451
I'm trying, but, man,
that guy can push my buttons.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.288
Why are you so mad at him?

02:44.789 --> 02:47.457
- Look, I don't wanna talk about it, okay?
- Well, it seems like...

02:47.667 --> 02:50.127
You wanna be on my list too?
Keep talking.

02:51.796 --> 02:54.339
Has anyone seen my list, by the way?

02:55.300 --> 02:56.800
Uh, no. What's it look like?

02:57.051 --> 03:00.012
- Um, a piece of paper and it says "Ross."
- I see.

03:02.265 --> 03:03.432
Hey.

03:03.766 --> 03:06.810
I just got off the phone with Estelle.
Guess what?

03:07.020 --> 03:08.478
I got the lead in a movie.

03:08.980 --> 03:11.648
You got the lead in a movie?
What's the movie about?

03:11.858 --> 03:13.942
Oh, it's called Shutterspeed.
It's really cool.

03:14.110 --> 03:19.406
Yeah, um, I meet this girl in the subway
and we fall in love in, like, a day, right?

03:19.657 --> 03:22.743
And then she disappears.
But I find out where she lives.

03:22.911 --> 03:26.622
And when I get there, this old lady
answers the door. I say, "Where's Betsy?"

03:26.789 --> 03:32.252
Right? And she says,
"Betsy's been dead 10 years."

03:33.755 --> 03:35.923
Ooh. Chilling.

03:36.132 --> 03:39.760
Oh, and the best part is we're filming
in the desert outside of Vegas.

03:40.011 --> 03:42.095
- You know what that means, buddy.
- Yeah, I know.

03:42.305 --> 03:46.058
Road trip. Yeah, we can rent a car.
I just have to be there by Tuesday.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.144
Oh, wait. My grandmother's dead.

03:53.066 --> 03:57.069
Well, uh, we can talk about that too,
Pheebs.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.278
No, no, her cab.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.615
She probably won't be using it.
You could drive it to Las Vegas.

04:01.824 --> 04:03.325
All right. Thanks, Pheebs.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.411
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are we gonna do about my job?

04:06.663 --> 04:09.623
- Oh, uh, not go.
- All right, great. Road trip, baby.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.084
Is this okay with you?

04:12.335 --> 04:15.712
Chandler, you don't have to ask
for my permission.

04:15.880 --> 04:16.922
- You can go.
- Thank you.

04:18.382 --> 04:20.841
Hey, Rach, come on, you're gonna
be late for the eye doctor.

04:21.010 --> 04:25.180
All right. Let's get this over with. Ugh.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.183
Oh, no.

04:28.393 --> 04:31.478
Look what I did.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.233
I mean, look at this mess.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.860
I mean, we're gonna probably
have to clean this up, you know?

04:39.028 --> 04:41.697
I mean, we're gonna have to reschedule.

04:42.824 --> 04:46.952
If you thought that this mess
was gonna bother me, you are wrong.

04:47.203 --> 04:49.037
All right, let's go, Blinky.

04:53.459 --> 04:54.501
Chandler.

05:00.758 --> 05:02.634
Oh, hey, Joey. What's up?

05:03.428 --> 05:06.346
I can't decide which route
to take to Vegas.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.432
Hey, you've traveled a lot, right?

05:08.641 --> 05:10.309
- Yeah, I've been around.
- Okay.

05:10.518 --> 05:13.854
So which route should I take?
The northern route or the southern route?

05:14.063 --> 05:17.649
Ooh, if you take the north route, there's
a man in Illinois with a beard of bees.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.279
Great. Problem solved.

05:22.780 --> 05:26.533
But on the southern route,
there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.

05:27.952 --> 05:30.037
Well, back to square one.

05:30.913 --> 05:32.831
Oh, I know a way that you can decide.

05:33.082 --> 05:35.417
All right, I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions...

05:35.585 --> 05:37.294
...and you answer as quickly as you can.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.963
- Yes.
- Good. But wait.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.134
Here we go. I want you to relax.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.386
Take a deep breath.

05:46.637 --> 05:49.264
Clear your mind.
Which do you like better...

05:49.432 --> 05:51.266
...peanut butter or egg whites?
- Peanut butter.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.602
- Rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
- Swimmer.

05:53.770 --> 05:57.397
- Rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
- Monica. Oh.

05:58.399 --> 05:59.858
I always thought it'd be Rachel.

06:00.943 --> 06:03.570
- No thinking, no thinking. Tie or ascot?
- Ascot.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.238
- North route or south route?
- North.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.741
- Bam, there you go. Huh?
- Wow.

06:08.451 --> 06:12.412
That was incredible.
Beard of bees here I come.

06:14.123 --> 06:17.209
- Hey.
- Oh, this guy again.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.213
Hey, what's up?

06:21.422 --> 06:23.757
Uh, not much.
You guys wanna see a movie tonight?

06:23.966 --> 06:26.718
- Sure. What do you wanna see?
- I don't know. Um...

06:26.886 --> 06:29.054
I know how we can decide.
Phoebe, show him your game.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.181
Um, no, thank you.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.226
What's with her?

06:34.477 --> 06:36.603
I don't know.
But I know how we can decide.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.940
Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions
and you answer real quick, okay?

06:40.149 --> 06:41.775
- What's better, action or comedy?
- Action.

06:41.984 --> 06:44.778
Who would you rather sleep with,
Monica or Rachel?

06:49.200 --> 06:51.201
Dude, you are sick.

06:52.995 --> 06:57.624
Oh. I'm sorry. I forgot you had
that whole Rachel thing.

07:03.548 --> 07:06.174
Oh, my God. What does that thing do?

07:08.136 --> 07:10.637
- Uh, that's an eye removal machine.
- All right, I'm out of here.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.472
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.349
Hi, Rachel, I'm Dr. Miller.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.853
Monica told me you were a little nervous,
but everything's gonna be just fine.

07:18.062 --> 07:21.189
- So we're done then.
- Almost, but first we gotta start.

07:21.524 --> 07:24.568
- This is the glaucoma test. Sit down.
- Uh-huh.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.695
- Okay.
- Put your chin here.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.530
Mm-hm.

07:28.698 --> 07:31.491
Now, you'll feel a small puff of air
in each eye.

07:31.659 --> 07:33.326
Uh, a what?

07:33.953 --> 07:37.080
A small puff of air. Now, come on.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.208
- Here we go.
- All right.

07:40.668 --> 07:43.670
One, two, three.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.046
Okay.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.132
I'm sorry. All right.

07:47.383 --> 07:50.010
Ha, ha, I'm gonna stay in here this time.
Okay.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.344
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

07:51.512 --> 07:54.473
- One, two...
- I'm sorry.

07:54.682 --> 07:57.267
You know what?
I'm gonna hold her head.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.644
- That's okay.
- Okay.

07:59.854 --> 08:00.896
Okay.

08:01.063 --> 08:02.230
- One...
- Uh-huh.

08:02.398 --> 08:05.025
...two...
- Oh! I'm sorry.

08:05.234 --> 08:08.487
You know what? You're young.
You probably don't have glaucoma.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.531
I'm okay.

08:11.699 --> 08:14.201
Okay, so it was very, very nice
to meet you, sir.

08:14.368 --> 08:17.704
- Ow! Hey, what are you...? Are you crazy?
- Okay.

08:17.872 --> 08:21.166
You got a small, minor infection
in that left eye.

08:21.417 --> 08:25.086
I want you to take these drops for a week
and you'll be as good as new.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.506
No, I don't put things in my eye.

08:28.007 --> 08:30.425
Okay then. I guess we'll see you
back here in three months.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.469
- Great.
- And I'll fit you for a glass eye.

08:32.678 --> 08:34.304
Okay, just give me the damn drops.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.515
Dr. Miller?

08:39.018 --> 08:40.477
P-E-C-F-D.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.439
Very good, Monica.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.818
- You know where they are.
- I sure do.

08:52.490 --> 08:53.532
And you don't get one.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.581
You know, I gotta tell you,
those eye drops are a miracle.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.625
My eye is 100 percent better.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.127
- They're still in my coat.
- Damn.

09:06.921 --> 09:08.964
- Hey.
- Hey, you ready to go?

09:09.131 --> 09:10.632
Listen, how cold is it gonna be there?

09:10.800 --> 09:13.176
Do I need a coat or will all these
sweater vests be enough?

09:14.971 --> 09:16.596
- What?
- I love you.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.893
Man, I wish Ross was coming with us.
I'm gonna miss him.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.896
Thanks a lot. I just got
that jerk out of my mind.

09:26.399 --> 09:29.442
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the
movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?

09:29.610 --> 09:31.778
Uh, no, not really.
It's an independent film.

09:31.988 --> 09:35.073
So we don't have a real big budget.
I figured I'd just stay in your room.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.953
I see, but once you get your first paycheck,
you'll be springing for a suite.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.205
Lead in the movie,
they must be paying you a lot.

09:42.456 --> 09:45.458
Oh, yeah. Check this out.
For every dollar Shutterspeed makes...

09:45.710 --> 09:48.878
...one penny of it
goes right in Joey's pocket.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.048
So you don't get paid
unless the movie makes money?

09:52.717 --> 09:55.760
Did you not hear the plot of the movie?

09:56.387 --> 09:59.723
"She's been dead for 10 years."

09:59.932 --> 10:02.017
I'm gonna be a millionaire.

10:03.102 --> 10:04.144
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:04.395 --> 10:06.021
I just wanted to say goodbye
to you guys.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.691
And to see if maybe you guys
will place a little bet for me.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.152
Twenty bucks on black 15.

10:12.361 --> 10:13.903
- You got it.
- All right.

10:14.780 --> 10:17.657
- All right. Bye-bye, now.
- Bye, you guys.

10:17.908 --> 10:19.534
- I'm gonna say goodbye at the car.
- Okay.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.996
Anybody wanna say
goodbye to me at the car?

10:23.205 --> 10:27.334
Oh, honey, I'll say goodbye to you
at the car if you don't mind the pus.

10:29.754 --> 10:30.795
See you.

10:31.672 --> 10:35.592
But wait a minute. The pus is good.
It means it's healing.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.848
Hey, Pheebs. What you reading?

10:44.143 --> 10:45.226
Pheebs?

10:47.730 --> 10:48.938
Hello?

10:50.024 --> 10:55.278
Phoebe?

10:56.447 --> 10:57.614
Come on.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.616
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see you there.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.913
Pheebs, are you mad at me
or something?

11:05.164 --> 11:07.582
Because if you are,
please tell me what it is I did.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.627
- Well, if you don't know, I can't help you.
- Well, I don't know.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.712
Well, I can't help you.

11:13.923 --> 11:18.468
Okay, well, whatever it is,
I am very, very sorry. Okay?

11:19.679 --> 11:20.887
Apology accepted.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.014
Okay.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.392
- So we're good?
- Uh-huh.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.894
All right.

11:29.897 --> 11:31.523
I'll, uh, see you later, okay?

11:31.732 --> 11:34.401
- Bye, fat ass.
- All right.

11:35.945 --> 11:39.656
Phoebe, come on, will you please tell me
what it is that made you so mad at me?

11:39.865 --> 11:42.659
I don't know. I don't remember.

11:43.869 --> 11:47.247
Well, if you can't remember,
can't we just forget about this?

11:47.456 --> 11:50.667
Oh, no. I am mad at you.
I know that much.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.169
But I am sorry about the "fat ass" thing...

11:53.337 --> 11:55.839
...because you actually have
a very sweet little heinie.

12:04.598 --> 12:08.393
Man, I'm getting pretty tired.
You might have to take over soon.

12:08.811 --> 12:12.981
We've been driving for a half-hour.
And you haven't looked at the road once.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.441
Don't worry. It's out there.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.154
- Maybe I just need lunch.
- Yeah.

12:19.321 --> 12:22.323
You wanna eat? My treat.

12:23.367 --> 12:25.285
Isn't that Ross' money?

12:26.162 --> 12:27.495
Yeah, okay.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.123
Ross' treat.
Where do you wanna eat?

12:30.374 --> 12:33.418
- I don't know.
- Oh, hey, I know how we can decide.

12:33.627 --> 12:35.545
All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you
questions...

12:35.713 --> 12:37.797
...and then you have to answer
real fast, okay?

12:37.965 --> 12:40.300
So, uh, clear your mind.
Clear it right out. Clear it out.

12:40.468 --> 12:41.885
Okay.

12:42.052 --> 12:45.555
- Would you rather be too wet or too dry?
- Too dry.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.265
- Do you believe in ghosts?
- No.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.684
- Is this movie gonna be my big break?
- No.

12:51.228 --> 12:53.813
- What?
- Yes.

12:54.315 --> 12:57.108
- Dude, you said no.
- I also said yes.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.319
You don't think this is gonna be
a big break for me?

12:59.487 --> 13:00.528
No.

13:03.491 --> 13:04.949
I don't believe this.

13:05.201 --> 13:08.745
Look, Joe, I just don't want you
to get your hopes up too high.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.956
What are you talking about?
I'm the lead in a movie.

13:12.166 --> 13:16.336
They're not even paying you.
This doesn't even sound like a real movie.

13:16.545 --> 13:19.589
You know, I don't know why
you're dumping all over my big break.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.550
Because, Joe, I don't think
this is going to be your big break.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.553
Is that why you're on this trip? Huh?
To make me feel like a loser?

13:25.721 --> 13:28.640
- Because if it is, I'd rather be alone.
- You don't want me on the trip?

13:28.849 --> 13:30.183
Not if you're like this.

13:30.434 --> 13:33.478
Tell you what, the next time
you ask me a question like that, I'll lie.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.438
Yeah, I don't want you on the trip.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.191
All right, fine.
Why don't you pull over? I'll get out now.

13:38.442 --> 13:39.609
Fine.

13:42.363 --> 13:43.404
Get out.

13:43.614 --> 13:45.406
You're not supposed to stop
on a bridge.

13:45.574 --> 13:47.450
- Get out.
- Fine.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.914
Wait. Wait. There's no sidewalk.

13:53.123 --> 13:55.583
Yeah. I'm gonna die here.

13:58.504 --> 14:01.214
Okay, are you mad at me
because my hair gel smells?

14:01.382 --> 14:02.674
No.

14:03.592 --> 14:06.970
Are you angry with me because I said
your handwriting is childlike?

14:07.179 --> 14:09.514
No, that made me feel precious.

14:10.391 --> 14:13.268
Oh, I know. Is it because he's always
correcting people's grammar?

14:13.435 --> 14:16.771
You know, "whom, whom."
Sometimes it's "who."

14:18.315 --> 14:20.191
Yeah? Sometimes it's...

14:23.195 --> 14:24.654
Oh, did you beat him at a board game?

14:24.822 --> 14:27.282
He turns into such a baby
when he starts to lose.

14:27.491 --> 14:30.660
- Okay, I'm the baby.
- Hey. Stop it.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.414
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

14:34.665 --> 14:37.083
Joey kicked me out of the car
on the bridge.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.377
- Why?
- I don't know. He went crazy.

14:39.587 --> 14:43.131
We were playing that game where you
ask a question and have to answer fast.

14:43.340 --> 14:46.759
Oh, that game should not be played
without my supervision.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.637
Well, I don't know what made him mad.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.849
All I said was that, uh, I didn't think
this was gonna be his big break...

14:53.017 --> 14:55.143
...that this movie wasn't gonna
do anything for him...

14:55.311 --> 14:57.145
...and that it didn't sound
like a real movie.

14:57.354 --> 15:00.148
Okay, he should've
pushed me off the bridge.

15:00.357 --> 15:01.399
What's in the bag?

15:01.567 --> 15:03.401
Oh, I figured you guys
would all be mad at me...

15:03.569 --> 15:06.321
...so I got you some gifts
that I found on the side of the road.

15:06.822 --> 15:09.324
- Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
- I do.

15:13.662 --> 15:14.704
Okay.

15:19.209 --> 15:22.712
- Not even close.
- Okay, well, help me. I can't do this.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.255
All right, come on. Let's do it.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.049
- All right.
- Sit down.

15:26.216 --> 15:29.218
- All right, put your head back. All right.
- Yes. Okay.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.805
- Now, open your eyes.
- Okay, they are.

15:34.683 --> 15:37.101
- How many fingers am I holding up?
- Four.

15:37.311 --> 15:38.603
Oh, my God, I was thinking four.

15:38.812 --> 15:40.897
- Really?
- Yes.

15:41.106 --> 15:44.108
All right, why don't we start
with a practice one, okay?

15:44.360 --> 15:46.569
- No drops.
- Great.

15:47.279 --> 15:51.574
On three. One, two, three.

15:52.534 --> 15:53.910
My pillow's all wet.

15:54.119 --> 15:56.120
Well, you said it was practice.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.998
- Then why did you move?
- Because I knew you were lying.

16:00.709 --> 16:03.252
- All right. Come here. Come on.
- What are you doing? Monica.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.588
Stop it! Oh, my God, stop it.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.674
I am going...

16:07.925 --> 16:09.717
- Turn it over.
- Aah!

16:09.969 --> 16:11.886
I am going to get...

16:13.347 --> 16:15.014
Get these drops in your eye.

16:15.224 --> 16:18.476
Oh, my God.
You really are freakishly strong.

16:19.812 --> 16:23.064
Aah! Aah! Monica, stop it!

16:24.483 --> 16:26.067
Damn, it's empty.

16:26.694 --> 16:30.446
Wow. If Joey and Chandler walked in
right now, we could make a fortune.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.372
Ooh, that is definitely Chandler,
Joey or Ross.

16:39.957 --> 16:40.999
Or Rachel.

16:44.253 --> 16:45.920
Hello? It's Joey.

16:48.549 --> 16:51.718
I'm so glad you called. Chandler told me
what happened. He's really upset.

16:52.177 --> 16:56.764
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he
finds out what I did with his sweater vests.

16:58.767 --> 17:00.226
What did you do to his sweater vests?

17:00.436 --> 17:03.104
Let's just say there's a well-dressed
pack of dogs in Ohio.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.402
Monica, listen, is Phoebe there?
I gotta ask her something about the car.

17:09.569 --> 17:11.029
Yeah, hold on one second.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.781
- Hey, dude.
- Hey, Pheebs.

17:13.991 --> 17:16.409
Listen, this wooden box
keeps sliding out from under the seat.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.161
- What is it?
- Oh, that's my grandma.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.584
And thanks, Joey.
She's having a really great time.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.130
Is that Joey? Is that Joey?
Let me talk to him.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.215
Joey, Chandler's here.
He was wondering if...

17:32.718 --> 17:35.636
Okay, I guess he ran out of change.

17:36.346 --> 17:37.388
He won't even talk to me.

17:37.556 --> 17:40.224
How am I gonna apologize to him
if he won't even talk to me?

17:40.476 --> 17:42.018
Maybe you should send him something.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.604
So when he gets to Las Vegas,
he'll know that you're sorry.

17:44.813 --> 17:49.192
That's a good idea. I wonder where
I could get a basket of porn?

17:50.194 --> 17:52.820
Oh, no, don't say I'm sorry with porn.

17:54.114 --> 17:56.532
You know what you should send him?
A carton of cigarettes.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.743
Because that way he can trade it
for protection.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.370
No. That's prison.

18:03.957 --> 18:05.083
Okay, Pheebs.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.085
I know how we're gonna figure this out.

18:07.252 --> 18:09.212
Okay. Clear your mind...

18:09.421 --> 18:12.924
...and answer the first thing
that comes into your head. Okay?

18:13.092 --> 18:14.217
Mm-hm.

18:14.384 --> 18:16.677
- What's better, flora or fauna?
- Fauna.

18:16.845 --> 18:18.387
- Simon or Garfunkel?
- Garfunkel.

18:18.555 --> 18:21.265
- Why are you mad at me?
- You said I was boring. Oh.

18:24.269 --> 18:25.770
When did I say you were boring?

18:25.979 --> 18:29.065
Oh, my God, I remember now.
We were playing chess.

18:29.274 --> 18:32.235
Phoebe, you and I
have never played chess.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.486
Oh, come on. Yes.

18:33.654 --> 18:37.615
Remember that time on the frozen lake?
We were playing. You said I was boring.

18:37.783 --> 18:41.744
And then you took off your energy mask
and you were Cameron Diaz.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.333
Okay, there's a chance
this may have been a dream.

19:14.987 --> 19:19.073
Hey. Stanley. Hey.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.033
Your leading man is here.
Let's get to work.

19:21.201 --> 19:25.371
Um, slight change of plans.
We've shut down.

19:26.331 --> 19:27.498
What? Why?

19:27.666 --> 19:30.001
It's a money thing. We don't have any.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.755
- Ha, ha. You're kidding, right?
- No.

19:35.424 --> 19:38.926
- What?
- It's probably just temporary.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.471
We're hoping to get more money soon,
so if you could just, uh, hang out.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.640
Hang out? How long?

19:44.808 --> 19:48.561
I don't know. A week. Maybe two.
The money'll turn up.

19:48.770 --> 19:52.190
People always wanna invest in movies.
Hey, you're not rich, are you?

19:52.441 --> 19:54.192
- No.
- Worth a shot.

19:56.069 --> 19:59.322
Well, Joey, let me know
where you're staying, okay?

20:01.909 --> 20:04.577
- Hey, pal. Are you Joey Tribbiani?
- Yeah.

20:04.828 --> 20:06.245
These got left for you.

20:06.496 --> 20:08.080
Thanks.

20:09.374 --> 20:12.877
"Congratulations on your big break."

20:43.951 --> 20:44.992
Hello?

20:45.244 --> 20:47.828
- Monica, it's Joey.
- Hey, Joey.

20:48.038 --> 20:50.414
Aw, you remember me
even though you're a big star.

20:50.582 --> 20:53.960
Aw, come on.
It'll be years before I forget you.

20:55.837 --> 20:57.755
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh?

20:58.006 --> 21:00.758
Do you have a dressing room?
Do you have a chair with your name on it?

21:00.926 --> 21:02.802
Uh, yeah, yeah, I got all that going on.

21:02.970 --> 21:07.056
Listen, uh, make sure you tell Chandler
he couldn't have been more wrong.

21:07.224 --> 21:10.726
Uh-oh, I gotta go, Monica.
My, uh, sushi's here.

21:15.023 --> 21:17.775
Sorry about that.
Thanks for waiting. Okay.

21:18.443 --> 21:19.819
Everybody smile.

21:20.362 --> 21:21.988
Okay.

21:22.155 --> 21:27.118
Thanks a lot. Enjoy your stay at Caesar's.
We hope it's toga-rific.

21:28.370 --> 21:31.289
Ugh. Kill me. Kill me now.

21:36.670 --> 21:40.089
- Hey, Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
- Yeah.

21:40.257 --> 21:41.716
- Go!
- Aah!

21:41.883 --> 21:45.303
What are you doing?
Get off! Oh, my God!

21:45.470 --> 21:47.638
- Hold it open. Okay.
- Aah!

21:53.812 --> 21:56.314
We'll see you in about
three or four hours.
