00:18.365 --> 00:20.595
We got a fire
offcounty road D-7

00:20.667 --> 00:22.931
two miles west of
the Canyon Ridge intersection.

00:23.003 --> 00:25.801
Suggest we dispatch
fire crews. Over.

00:25.872 --> 00:27.635
(static)

00:27.708 --> 00:29.266
This is DeputyWright.

00:29.343 --> 00:30.867
Doyou copy?

00:32.612 --> 00:34.375
Son ofa...

00:52.766 --> 00:53.994
Sir?

00:54.067 --> 00:55.796
Sorry to disturbyou, sir

00:55.869 --> 00:58.838
but we've picked up
an unidentified bogey.

00:58.905 --> 01:02.306
l thinkyou should see
the replay foryourself.

01:13.687 --> 01:14.984
lt tripped the fence
at 231 7

01:15.055 --> 01:16.613
offConnecticut's coast.

01:16.690 --> 01:18.555
lnitial trajectory,
north by northwest.

01:18.625 --> 01:19.956
then it went crazy.

01:20.026 --> 01:22.153
Any other aircraft in the area?

01:22.262 --> 01:24.787
No known aircraft
can maneuver like this.

01:24.898 --> 01:26.798
Well,
whatever it was

01:26.867 --> 01:29.836
dropped offthe screen
at 241 8, sir.

01:29.903 --> 01:31.837
Hit ground west
of Lake Michigan

01:31.905 --> 01:33.600
outside
Townsend, Wisconsin.

01:33.673 --> 01:35.573
The tracking
prediction team

01:35.642 --> 01:37.542
calculated impact
at over 800

01:37.611 --> 01:38.908
miles per hour.

01:38.979 --> 01:41.174
l've instructed Chief Koretz

01:41.248 --> 01:42.215
to start
her report...

01:42.282 --> 01:43.214
Negative.

01:43.283 --> 01:44.875
She tracked
a meteor.

01:44.951 --> 01:46.578
lt's aberrant movement

01:46.653 --> 01:49.247
was due
to instrument malfunction.

01:49.322 --> 01:50.346
But, sir...

01:50.424 --> 01:53.154
Your report
will refect these facts.

01:53.226 --> 01:54.284
ls that clear?

01:54.394 --> 01:55.292
Yes, sir.

01:55.395 --> 01:57.090
Good.

02:06.173 --> 02:08.937
Code lndigo-Delta-Echo-Niner.

02:09.008 --> 02:12.376
l have a confirmed fallen angel
in sector 87.

02:12.446 --> 02:16.075
Mobilize Operation Falcon
immediately.

02:33.166 --> 02:35.191
Wright:
Hello?

02:48.248 --> 02:51.376
(screaming)

03:46.940 --> 03:48.635
Reporter:
Theywill have no comment

03:48.708 --> 03:51.040
until the government
investigation now underway

03:51.111 --> 03:52.578
is completed.

03:52.646 --> 03:54.375
Government officials
remain vague

03:54.447 --> 03:58.474
about the toxic cargo that has
caused the immediate evacuation

03:58.552 --> 04:01.544
ofTownsend, Wisconsin's,
1 2,000 residents.

04:01.621 --> 04:03.748
Speculation here
has centered on

04:03.823 --> 04:05.916
a shipment oftoxic waste.

04:06.026 --> 04:08.517
Mulder:
Then what happened out there
if wasn't a train wreck?

04:08.628 --> 04:11.563
Man:
Mr. Mulder, the continental
United States is surrounded

04:11.665 --> 04:16.932
by an electronic fence
that reaches 1 5,000 miles

04:17.003 --> 04:18.435
into space.

04:18.505 --> 04:20.404
We use it
to track and monitor

04:20.473 --> 04:25.501
the 7,087 man-made objects
that orbit the earth.

04:25.579 --> 04:29.709
Last night at 231 7
that fence was breached.

04:29.783 --> 04:31.717
This morning at 01 00

04:31.785 --> 04:34.413
Operation Falcon
went into effect

04:34.487 --> 04:37.251
led by Colonel Calvin Henderson

04:37.324 --> 04:39.815
the Air Force's
reclamations expert.

04:39.926 --> 04:41.393
Reclamations?

04:41.494 --> 04:43.257
During the Cold War,
hisjob

04:43.330 --> 04:46.731
was to prevent technologies
from downed U.S. aircraft

04:46.833 --> 04:48.767
from getting
into Soviet hands.

04:48.835 --> 04:51.633
He's part
ofa crash retrieval unit.

04:51.705 --> 04:53.605
Mm-hmm.

04:53.673 --> 04:56.141
Quick response.

04:56.209 --> 04:59.576
l'd sayyou have
24 hours

04:59.646 --> 05:02.342
before the entire area
is sanitized.

05:02.415 --> 05:06.545
After that, it would be
like nothing ever happened.

05:43.957 --> 05:46.357
Man:
Alright, get the trucks rolling.

05:47.727 --> 05:49.354
Man:
Keep 'emgoing!

05:54.067 --> 05:59.562
(chattering)

06:08.448 --> 06:13.545
(soldiers chattering)

06:13.620 --> 06:17.613
(helicopter whirring)

06:18.425 --> 06:19.858
Thankyou, sir.

06:19.926 --> 06:21.154
Thankyou.

06:21.261 --> 06:23.752
Get 'er rolling.
Let's go! Let's go!

06:32.872 --> 06:34.737
Soldier:
Alright, clear the road!

06:43.516 --> 06:44.813
You're late, lieutenant.

06:44.884 --> 06:46.681
lt will be dark
in a halfhour.

06:46.753 --> 06:48.220
We had a fat, sir.

06:48.288 --> 06:50.415
There's a briefing
at 2200 hours.

06:50.490 --> 06:52.685
Go to headquarters
for live rounds.

06:52.792 --> 06:53.884
Live rounds, sir?

06:53.993 --> 06:55.620
You got a problem
with that?

06:55.729 --> 06:57.594
We were told
this was a drill.

06:57.664 --> 06:59.222
They told you wrong.

06:59.332 --> 07:01.061
Sir.

07:02.302 --> 07:03.530
Okay, everyone out!

07:03.603 --> 07:05.730
Come on, people,
light a fire!

08:11.104 --> 08:15.097
(indistinctchattering)

08:21.581 --> 08:24.141
Man: Uh, roger,
this is Charley-Delta-SevenSquad.

08:24.217 --> 08:26.742
We're continuing thesearch,
butat this time, it'snegative.

08:29.622 --> 08:35.561
(men yelling)

08:41.967 --> 08:46.803
(whooshing noises)

09:09.996 --> 09:13.454
(shutter clicking)

09:39.425 --> 09:42.087
(shutter clicking rapidly)

09:49.235 --> 09:51.294
Youjust made
the worst mistake

09:51.404 --> 09:53.702
ofyour life,
Agent Mulder.

09:55.408 --> 09:57.740
l thinkyou knocked out
a filling.

09:57.810 --> 09:59.368
You'll pay the price

09:59.445 --> 10:01.470
for putting my men
at risk.

10:01.547 --> 10:05.108
Since when does taking pictures
put lives at risk?

10:05.184 --> 10:07.652
You violated
a U.S. Government quarantine

10:07.720 --> 10:09.415
and that's a federal crime.

10:09.489 --> 10:10.649
A quarantine?

10:10.723 --> 10:12.156
That's whatyou call this?

10:12.225 --> 10:15.854
We're trying to contain
an ecological disaster.

10:15.929 --> 10:18.989
That's a lot offirepower
to protect Mother Nature.

10:19.098 --> 10:20.497
l have my orders

10:20.600 --> 10:24.798
and the license to execute them
as l see fit.

10:24.904 --> 10:27.304
l suggest
you forget whatyou saw

10:27.373 --> 10:30.536
orwhatyou thinkyou saw

10:30.610 --> 10:32.544
foryour own well-being.

10:32.612 --> 10:35.740
You've got a downed craft
in those woods, sir

10:35.815 --> 10:38.079
and troops
carrying live rounds.

10:38.151 --> 10:40.381
We both know what's out there!

10:58.571 --> 11:02.439
Areyou MUFON or KUFOS?

11:08.481 --> 11:10.142
Doyou mind ifl sit down?

11:10.216 --> 11:11.376
Let me guess.

11:11.451 --> 11:14.682
You're wh that new group,
CSlCOP, right?

11:16.656 --> 11:19.284
Say no more.
You're a cautious man.

11:19.359 --> 11:21.224
Trust no one-- verywise.

11:21.294 --> 11:25.424
Afterwhat happened toJ.F.K.,
l understand completely.

11:25.498 --> 11:27.489
Let me
introduce myself.

11:27.567 --> 11:29.057
My name is Max Fenig.

11:29.168 --> 11:32.467
l'm with the National
lnvestigative Committee

11:32.538 --> 11:34.733
ofAerial Phenomenon--
NlCAP.

11:37.410 --> 11:40.607
Pleased... pleased
to makeyour acquaintance.

11:40.680 --> 11:43.410
l wish we could shake on it,
you know.

11:43.483 --> 11:45.917
Firm grip,
look right in the eye--

11:45.985 --> 11:48.852
you learn a lot
about a guy that way.

11:50.623 --> 11:52.523
Can l, um..?

11:52.592 --> 11:54.822
Can l askyou a question?

11:54.894 --> 11:57.362
Go ahead.

11:57.397 --> 11:58.887
Did you
see anything?

11:58.965 --> 12:00.023
Did you get close?

12:00.133 --> 12:01.259
Me, l saw nothing.

12:01.367 --> 12:02.800
l didn't see anything!

12:02.869 --> 12:03.927
Nada, zip.

12:04.037 --> 12:06.130
A hundred yards
past the roadblock

12:06.239 --> 12:07.206
they nailed me.

12:07.306 --> 12:09.171
l have no idea
how they did it.

12:09.242 --> 12:10.834
l'm telling you

12:10.910 --> 12:13.606
it's like the Roswell cover-up
all over again.

12:13.679 --> 12:17.308
What makes you so sure
there's something out there?

12:20.253 --> 12:23.552
Same thing
that makes you so sure?

12:54.387 --> 12:56.548
l didn't order room service.

12:56.622 --> 12:58.487
This isn't funny,
Mulder.

12:58.558 --> 12:59.684
Did you meet Max?

12:59.759 --> 13:01.124
Who?

13:01.194 --> 13:02.786
Max from NlCAP.

13:02.862 --> 13:05.194
Oh. They must have released him.

13:05.264 --> 13:09.223
Another intrepid soul
in search ofa close encounter.

13:09.302 --> 13:10.963
ls that what this is about?

13:11.070 --> 13:12.594
What else?

13:12.705 --> 13:15.640
Try explaining that
to Section Chief McGrath.

13:15.708 --> 13:17.539
He's ordering
a full inquiry

13:17.610 --> 13:19.168
with a recommendation...

13:19.245 --> 13:22.874
Mulder, he wants to shut down
the X-Files

13:22.949 --> 13:24.746
and he wants you
out ofthe Bureau.

13:24.817 --> 13:27.081
What else is new?

13:27.153 --> 13:29.485
l don't understand you, Mulder--

13:29.555 --> 13:31.955
whyyou're always
defying protocol

13:32.024 --> 13:33.514
ignoringjurisdiction.

13:33.593 --> 13:35.925
Because l know
what l saw, Scully.

13:35.995 --> 13:37.963
There weren't train tracks
anywhere near that site.

13:38.030 --> 13:39.691
So how could it have been
a derailed container?

13:39.799 --> 13:41.391
Because it wasn't.

13:41.501 --> 13:43.969
Whatyou saw
was not a toxic spill.

13:44.036 --> 13:46.834
But it wasn't
a U.F.O., either.

13:48.608 --> 13:51.270
Okay, l'm all ears.
what was it?

13:51.344 --> 13:54.939
lt was a downed Libyanjet
with a nuclearwarhead.

13:55.014 --> 13:56.948
(chuckling)

13:57.016 --> 13:59.280
Over U.S. airspace?

13:59.352 --> 14:01.411
They've been
picking up radiation

14:01.487 --> 14:03.785
indicating
that the plutonium casing

14:03.856 --> 14:04.948
may have cracked.

14:05.024 --> 14:06.616
So to avoid mass panic...

14:06.692 --> 14:08.660
You really believe that story?

14:08.728 --> 14:10.821
That story happens to be
highly classified.

14:10.897 --> 14:12.592
A highly classified lie.

14:12.665 --> 14:15.691
(helicopterwhirring)

14:15.801 --> 14:17.735
They're searching
for someone, Scully.

14:17.803 --> 14:20.237
Probably the pilot.

14:20.306 --> 14:23.241
You think they'd roll out
all this material

14:23.309 --> 14:25.402
for one Libyan fighterjock?

14:27.013 --> 14:29.948
Besides, no human pilot
walked away from that wreckage.

14:31.150 --> 14:33.710
Well, maybe he ejected.

14:35.321 --> 14:36.379
Maybe.

15:20.866 --> 15:22.561
Scully:
You can't be serious.

15:22.635 --> 15:25.502
As long as we're here
in Townsend, why not?

15:25.571 --> 15:27.436
The hearing
is tomorrow morning.

15:27.506 --> 15:29.906
That gives us 24 hours
to investigate.

15:29.976 --> 15:32.001
My assignment
is to bring you back--

15:32.078 --> 15:34.046
not to helpyou
dig yourselfin deeper.

15:34.113 --> 15:36.081
The LastDetail
starring Dana Scully.

15:36.382 --> 15:40.876
(phone offthe hook)

15:45.858 --> 15:47.223
What's going on?

15:47.326 --> 15:49.954
Looks like housekeeping
hasn't been hereyet.

15:50.062 --> 15:50.994
Who would..?

15:51.097 --> 15:52.155
(banging)

15:52.265 --> 15:54.062
Shh.

15:54.133 --> 15:55.532
(banging)

16:17.456 --> 16:18.787
Max?

16:21.093 --> 16:22.890
Getyour hands up!

16:22.995 --> 16:24.860
Whoa, don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

16:24.930 --> 16:26.397
Max?

16:26.499 --> 16:28.524
Ahem.

16:32.605 --> 16:33.503
My apologies.

16:33.572 --> 16:34.504
Forgive me.

16:34.573 --> 16:35.801
l'm a curious man.

16:35.875 --> 16:37.137
l had to know.

16:37.209 --> 16:38.073
Know what?

16:38.144 --> 16:39.543
lfit was reallyyou.

16:39.612 --> 16:40.806
You don't know me.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.745
Wejust met last night.

16:42.815 --> 16:46.342
We at NlCAP have been
following your career closely

16:46.419 --> 16:48.250
sinceyour involvement
with X-Files.

16:48.321 --> 16:50.289
Following my career? How?

16:50.356 --> 16:52.586
The Freedom oflnformation Act.

16:52.658 --> 16:54.592
Your travel expenses

16:54.660 --> 16:56.321
are a matter
ofpublic record.

16:56.429 --> 17:00.263
So this must be
the enigmatic Agent Scully.

17:02.134 --> 17:03.761
How did you
recognize me?

17:03.836 --> 17:06.669
l sawyour picture
in a trade publication once

17:06.739 --> 17:09.708
and l read your article in Omni
about the Gulf Breeze Sightings.

17:10.843 --> 17:13.710
l published that
under a pseudonym.

17:13.779 --> 17:15.406
M.F. Luder. l know.

17:15.481 --> 17:17.608
lt's an anagram for F. Mulder.

17:17.683 --> 17:21.414
You really didn't think
that would fool us, did you?

17:21.487 --> 17:24.512
l didn't think anybody
was paying attention.

17:24.589 --> 17:27.684
Somebody is always
paying attention, Mr. Mulder.

17:27.792 --> 17:29.988
Amazing.

17:30.096 --> 17:31.358
Amazing? Hardly.

17:31.430 --> 17:34.228
You want to see
something amazing

17:34.300 --> 17:35.767
come with me.

17:39.205 --> 17:41.696
Enigmatic Dr. Scully.

17:52.818 --> 17:54.683
This is my, uh...

17:54.754 --> 17:56.585
Right this way.

17:56.655 --> 17:58.213
Excuse the mess.

17:58.290 --> 17:59.917
Okay.

18:00.025 --> 18:02.323
Where's those, uh...

18:06.465 --> 18:07.693
Let me turn this off.

18:07.767 --> 18:09.064
Theywere right here.

18:11.604 --> 18:12.866
Oh, here they are.

18:12.938 --> 18:16.772
The latest crop circle photos
from Project Argus. Huh?

18:16.842 --> 18:18.537
Your opinion--
fact or fraud?

18:18.611 --> 18:19.942
Mulder:
Fraud.

18:20.012 --> 18:23.971
Max:
Explain the anomalous blisters
on the plants.

18:24.049 --> 18:26.574
Mulder:
Some unreported weathering
effect common to wheat

18:26.652 --> 18:28.745
or a systematic reaction
by the plant tissue

18:28.821 --> 18:30.015
to being lodged
in one position.

18:30.089 --> 18:31.522
Max:
You've read the literature.

18:31.590 --> 18:33.888
Mulder:
l try to keep up.

18:33.993 --> 18:36.291
You said you had
something to show us.

18:36.395 --> 18:38.761
Oh, yeah.
The Wolfs Ear 2000.

18:38.831 --> 18:40.059
Ever hear ofthis?

18:40.099 --> 18:41.828
Yeah. Wolfindustries
supplies the C.l.A.

18:41.901 --> 18:43.425
with all ofits
surveillance equipment.

18:43.536 --> 18:44.901
State-of-the-art
search and intercept--

18:44.970 --> 18:47.404
up to 1 00 channels
per second.

18:47.473 --> 18:49.805
l'm jacked into local
fire and police departments

18:49.875 --> 18:51.570
cellular phone pathways

18:51.644 --> 18:53.043
and when the weather's right

18:53.112 --> 18:56.138
air traffic control
from Whitmarsh air force base.

18:56.215 --> 18:57.648
What haveyou got, Max?

18:58.884 --> 19:02.251
Mobile unit broadcast
in scan mode

19:02.321 --> 19:05.381
Townsend Sheriffs Department
two nights ago.

19:05.458 --> 19:07.653
We got a fire
offcounty road D-7

19:07.760 --> 19:08.920
two miles west

19:09.028 --> 19:11.155
ofthe Canyon Ridge
intersection.

19:11.263 --> 19:13.754
Suggest we dispatch
fire crews. Over.

19:13.866 --> 19:15.333
This is DeputyWright.

19:15.434 --> 19:16.526
Doyou copy?

19:16.602 --> 19:18.934
And then this, 35 minutes later

19:19.004 --> 19:21.302
presumably from the fire crew.

19:21.373 --> 19:24.103
Reception got wiggy
for some reason.

19:24.176 --> 19:25.575
This is Unit 53.

19:25.644 --> 19:28.044
Man down. Request medevac.

19:28.113 --> 19:31.344
l said request medevac.

19:31.417 --> 19:34.978
You're breaking up.
Barely... bad...

19:35.054 --> 19:37.579
Very bad. Wait a second.

19:37.656 --> 19:38.588
What the hell?

19:38.657 --> 19:40.750
Charlie, we got
a situation here.

19:44.463 --> 19:46.294
We put up a tight net.

19:46.365 --> 19:48.333
Yes, sir, every inch
ofground is being covered

19:48.434 --> 19:50.231
dug up, squeezed, and sifted.

19:50.302 --> 19:53.100
No, sir.
lt will not get away.

19:53.172 --> 19:54.799
Not this time.

20:16.495 --> 20:17.928
Mrs. Wright?

20:19.331 --> 20:20.559
Hi. l'm Fox Mulder.

20:20.633 --> 20:21.861
This is Dana Scully.

20:21.934 --> 20:23.128
We're from the F.B.l.

20:23.202 --> 20:25.636
We'd like to askyou
aboutyour husband.

20:25.704 --> 20:26.898
He's dead.

20:26.972 --> 20:29.202
What else is there
to know?

20:34.346 --> 20:36.109
l'm sorry
aboutyour husband.

20:36.181 --> 20:37.273
Oh, please.

20:37.349 --> 20:39.180
Mrs. Wright,
we want to helpyou.

20:39.251 --> 20:40.980
Then leave me alone.

20:41.053 --> 20:42.247
Let us helpyou.

20:42.321 --> 20:44.346
l don't know anything.

20:51.130 --> 20:53.121
Don'tyou understand?

20:53.232 --> 20:55.962
Theywon't even release the body

20:56.035 --> 20:58.265
so l can give him
a proper burial, okay?

20:58.337 --> 21:02.535
The government
can't do that.

21:02.608 --> 21:04.439
l'm sure
ifwe appealed...

21:04.510 --> 21:07.035
No! You can't.

21:07.112 --> 21:09.012
You're entitled
to the truth.

21:09.081 --> 21:11.709
l can't afford the truth.

21:11.784 --> 21:13.684
They said ifl
spoke to anyone

21:13.752 --> 21:17.745
theywould withhold
my husband's pension

21:17.823 --> 21:21.122
and l have a child
to take care of.

21:26.365 --> 21:28.128
(static screeching)

21:28.200 --> 21:31.397
Picking up extremely high
frequency signal--

21:31.470 --> 21:32.937
200,000 megahertz.

21:33.005 --> 21:34.905
Sir, target

21:34.974 --> 21:36.601
on the northeast side.

21:36.675 --> 21:37.699
foot speed--

21:37.776 --> 21:39.539
seven miles per hour, sir.

21:39.612 --> 21:40.579
Beta team...

21:40.646 --> 21:41.840
Copy.

21:41.914 --> 21:44.212
Target entering your section
from the southwest.

21:44.283 --> 21:45.648
Search and destroy.

21:45.718 --> 21:48.118
Repeat-- search and destroy.

21:48.187 --> 21:49.552
Yes, sir.

22:40.005 --> 22:41.267
jackson?

22:41.340 --> 22:43.035
Nothing.

22:59.958 --> 23:02.324
Must have been an animal.

23:19.378 --> 23:21.812
l'm sorry, but unless
you have a subpoena

23:21.880 --> 23:24.041
l can't discuss
patient information.

23:24.149 --> 23:26.811
Does that meanJason Wright
was your patient?

23:26.919 --> 23:29.649
lt means l have
nothing more to say.

23:29.722 --> 23:32.054
What about to his wife
and child, Doctor?

23:32.124 --> 23:34.354
Would you have anything
to say to them?

23:34.426 --> 23:36.826
Because whoever got toyou
also got to her.

23:36.895 --> 23:39.420
They must have made
some pretty big threats.

23:39.498 --> 23:41.363
What did they hold
overyour head--

23:41.433 --> 23:43.162
your medical license,
the l.R.S.?

23:43.235 --> 23:44.395
l hate fascists.

23:44.470 --> 23:45.664
Excuse me?

23:45.738 --> 23:47.569
The men who came in here--

23:47.639 --> 23:50.972
The way they
pushed us all around.

23:55.347 --> 23:57.542
Dr. Oppenheim, tell us
about the deputy.

23:57.649 --> 23:59.241
You saw him that night

23:59.351 --> 24:01.182
didn'tyou?

24:01.253 --> 24:02.220
Yes.

24:02.321 --> 24:04.152
And three others
from a fire crew.

24:04.223 --> 24:07.283
Theywere all D.O.A. with
fifth- and sixth-degree burns

24:07.359 --> 24:09.190
over 90% oftheir bodies.

24:09.261 --> 24:11.752
But theyweren't like
any burns l've ever seen.

24:11.830 --> 24:13.058
They took the bodies away

24:13.132 --> 24:15.430
before we could perform
any pathology.

24:15.501 --> 24:18.698
Did you note any cadaveric
heat rigor or stiffening?

24:18.771 --> 24:20.602
Quite a bit offexion
in the limbs.

24:20.672 --> 24:22.299
How doyou know
so much about it?

24:22.374 --> 24:25.673
l did my residency
in forensic medicine.

24:25.744 --> 24:27.143
ln your opinion

24:27.212 --> 24:30.670
could those burns have been
caused by ionizing radiation?

24:30.783 --> 24:32.751
Well, l hadn't thought.

24:32.818 --> 24:34.376
l suppose it's possible

24:34.486 --> 24:37.944
ifthe exposure
was sufficiently intense.

24:42.694 --> 24:45.219
Let's say those men died
from radiation exposure.

24:45.297 --> 24:47.561
Couldn't it have been
from the cracked core

24:47.633 --> 24:48.998
ofa nuclearwarhead?

24:49.067 --> 24:51.262
l've read about
these kinds ofburns.

24:51.336 --> 24:53.600
So have l--
in Hiroshima at ground zero.

24:53.672 --> 24:55.936
l'm talking about
close encounter mortalities.

24:56.008 --> 24:58.670
l have a stack ofX-Files
reporting the same results.

24:58.744 --> 25:01.042
l don't claim to know
all the answers

25:01.113 --> 25:03.775
but ifwe don't make
the O.P.R. inquest

25:03.882 --> 25:05.008
by tomorrow morning

25:05.117 --> 25:07.551
there may not be
any more X-Files.

25:13.859 --> 25:17.090
(moaning)

25:21.667 --> 25:24.067
(moaning)

25:50.529 --> 25:53.396
Start an l.V. here, stat.

25:53.465 --> 25:54.989
Mulder:
Tell us what happened.

25:55.067 --> 25:57.661
Whatever happened
has nothing to do with you.

25:57.736 --> 25:59.294
Wrong, Colonel.

25:59.371 --> 26:01.999
We want the same thing,
onlyyou want it dead.

26:02.074 --> 26:03.769
Can'tyou see that
chasing it down

26:03.842 --> 26:06.538
leaves it no choice
but to defend itself?

26:06.612 --> 26:10.104
How many more have to die before
you rethinkyour approach?

26:10.215 --> 26:11.273
Listen to me

26:11.383 --> 26:12.907
'cause l'm not wasting
another breath on this.

26:13.018 --> 26:14.451
lfyou and your partner

26:14.519 --> 26:16.111
aren't out ofhere
in 30 seconds...

26:16.221 --> 26:18.086
Agent Scully stays here.

26:18.156 --> 26:20.716
We're undermanned,
she's a doctor-- she stays.

26:20.792 --> 26:21.918
lfthat's okay.

26:21.994 --> 26:22.926
Ofcourse.

26:22.995 --> 26:23.927
lfyou don't mind

26:23.996 --> 26:25.429
youjust take care ofmy men

26:25.497 --> 26:26.930
and let me do mywork.

26:29.835 --> 26:32.326
Outside this emergency room
you can do whateveryou want

26:32.404 --> 26:34.531
but in here l call the shots--

26:34.606 --> 26:36.198
assuming, ofcourse

26:36.275 --> 26:39.870
you want me to take care
ofyour men.

26:42.180 --> 26:43.545
Get this man

26:43.649 --> 26:45.310
out ofmy sight.

26:47.686 --> 26:50.018
Where do l scrub up?

27:05.404 --> 27:07.497
Max.

27:08.607 --> 27:10.575
Hey, Max.

27:10.642 --> 27:12.007
Max.

27:56.154 --> 27:58.088
Hey... Max.

27:58.156 --> 28:02.217
Who are... who areyou?

28:02.294 --> 28:06.424
Max, it's me, Fox Mulder.

28:06.498 --> 28:08.989
You okay?

28:09.067 --> 28:12.002
What areyou doing here?

28:15.874 --> 28:18.843
You were having
some kind ofseizure.

28:18.910 --> 28:20.844
Seizure?

28:20.912 --> 28:23.278
That's impossible.

28:28.720 --> 28:34.158
You were lying on the foor
unconscious, convulsing.

28:34.226 --> 28:36.660
That's odd.

28:36.728 --> 28:39.595
l haven't had an episode
in seven years--

28:39.664 --> 28:42.792
not since l went on medication.

28:44.169 --> 28:46.865
Let's getyou to the hospital.

28:46.938 --> 28:48.030
No.

28:48.106 --> 28:51.007
l mean, l mean
it's not necessary.

28:51.076 --> 28:52.202
You sure?

28:52.277 --> 28:55.303
Yeah. l lived with epilepsy
all my life.

28:55.380 --> 28:58.508
l'm not in any danger.

29:09.761 --> 29:12.161
Yeah, it started
in South Dakota

29:12.230 --> 29:13.720
when l was ten.

29:13.799 --> 29:17.200
The doctor said l must
have incurred a head injury.

29:17.269 --> 29:19.897
l don't remember
ever hitting my head.

29:19.971 --> 29:22.633
You have no memory
ofyour seizures?

29:22.707 --> 29:26.473
As a kid l used to wake up
in strange places

29:26.545 --> 29:30.504
with no idea where l was
or how l got there.

29:30.582 --> 29:33.551
(sighs)

29:34.820 --> 29:36.583
Sorry. l...

29:36.655 --> 29:39.488
l got to,
l got to go to sleep.

29:39.558 --> 29:41.082
All right.

30:34.646 --> 30:36.614
(sighing)

30:36.681 --> 30:38.615
Rough night, huh?

30:38.683 --> 30:40.708
lt was terrible.

30:40.785 --> 30:42.878
We lost all but two

30:42.954 --> 30:45.081
and they're still
in critical condition

30:45.157 --> 30:47.421
on theirway
to the burn unit

30:47.492 --> 30:49.255
atJohns Hopkins.

30:49.327 --> 30:51.795
So what doyou think, Scully?

30:51.863 --> 30:53.763
What's going on out there?

30:53.832 --> 30:56.630
l don't know, and under
other circumstances

30:56.701 --> 30:58.601
l would like to find out

30:58.703 --> 31:02.662
but we have a plane to catch
injust over an hour.

31:02.774 --> 31:06.210
l wantyou to take
a look at something first.

31:06.278 --> 31:07.210
What?

31:07.279 --> 31:08.576
Max.

31:08.647 --> 31:11.844
There's an unusual incision
behind his left ear.

31:11.917 --> 31:14.477
l've seen this incision
twice before.

31:15.887 --> 31:18.117
Two women--
a thousand miles apart

31:18.190 --> 31:20.658
no way ofknowing each other,
no relation.

31:20.725 --> 31:23.558
both claim to have been
abducted by aliens.

31:23.628 --> 31:27.894
areyou saying Max Fenig
is an abductee?

31:29.334 --> 31:30.961
Mulder

31:31.069 --> 31:34.004
the man is taking
powerful antipsychotic drugs.

31:34.072 --> 31:36.336
l saw them in his R.V.

31:36.408 --> 31:38.842
They're for his epilepsy.

31:38.910 --> 31:40.969
Dilantin is an anti-convulsant

31:41.046 --> 31:44.504
but Mellaril is used exclusively
to treat schizophrenia.

31:44.583 --> 31:47.313
More than likely,
Max is delusional.

31:47.385 --> 31:49.410
You don't seem
to understand, Scully.

31:49.487 --> 31:52.422
Max doesn't believe
he was abducted by aliens.

31:52.490 --> 31:54.082
l believe he was.

31:56.027 --> 32:00.054
Now, could you at least
take a look at the scar

32:00.131 --> 32:02.565
and give meyour
medical opinion?

32:02.634 --> 32:04.534
Okay.

32:04.603 --> 32:06.594
You pack.

32:06.671 --> 32:11.665
l'll take a look at Max
on the way to the airport.

32:12.811 --> 32:16.406
Sir, l have fash traffic
at 24-1 8.

32:16.481 --> 32:19.075
Repeated calls for l.D.
go unanswered

32:19.150 --> 32:22.916
and it's not in the orbital
or sub-orbital inventory.

32:22.988 --> 32:24.956
24-1 8--
isn't that where..?

32:25.023 --> 32:26.422
Same exact spot, sir

32:26.491 --> 32:28.925
though l am reading
a much larger craft.

32:28.994 --> 32:30.791
Meteor, Ms. Koretz.

32:30.862 --> 32:34.559
A much larger meteor, sir.

32:36.201 --> 32:37.964
Hold on a second.

32:38.069 --> 32:39.331
We have a confirm.

32:39.437 --> 32:41.337
Whitmarsh Air Force Base
is tracking.

32:41.406 --> 32:42.532
Where is it?

32:42.641 --> 32:46.577
Well, sir, the meteor
seems to be hovering

32:46.678 --> 32:49.704
over a small town
in eastern Wisconsin.

33:46.905 --> 33:50.204
Come on, Mulder,
let's get this overwith.

33:51.810 --> 33:54.370
Hey, Max.

33:54.446 --> 33:55.606
Max.

33:57.382 --> 33:59.009
Max?

33:59.084 --> 34:01.052
Hey, Max.

34:07.726 --> 34:09.216
Max?

34:10.395 --> 34:12.989
Mulder, look at this.

34:13.063 --> 34:15.498
Mulder:
What is that? Blood?

34:23.641 --> 34:26.337
Man:Falcon Patrol
reporting unidentifiedtrespass.

34:26.411 --> 34:29.972
Repeat. Falcon Patrolreporting
unidentifiedtrespass
at the waterfront

34:35.652 --> 34:37.348
Mulder!

34:37.422 --> 34:38.286
Come on.

34:38.356 --> 34:40.722
Where doyou think
you're going?

34:40.792 --> 34:43.659
lfwe go to the airport now,
we might make the plane

34:43.728 --> 34:45.355
which would giveyou
halfa chance

34:45.429 --> 34:46.658
ofdefending yourself.

34:46.731 --> 34:47.663
Think about it.

34:47.732 --> 34:49.699
Max is a gypsy,
nomad, right?

34:49.768 --> 34:50.757
Yes. So what?

34:50.835 --> 34:52.735
He intercepted
Wright's last call

34:52.837 --> 34:54.031
to his dispatcher

34:54.139 --> 34:56.733
which means he was here
in Townsend, Wisconsin

34:56.841 --> 34:58.240
the night ofthe crash.

34:58.309 --> 35:01.369
Ofall the places he could
have been, he was here.

35:01.446 --> 35:02.470
lf Max
was abducted

35:02.547 --> 35:03.844
that would go
a long way

35:03.915 --> 35:05.542
to explaining
his obsessions.

35:05.617 --> 35:09.917
lfwe figure that out, you
can be sure Henderson has.

35:09.988 --> 35:11.956
Doyou have the keys?

35:25.970 --> 35:27.938
(panting)

35:40.485 --> 35:41.816
Don't do this.

35:41.886 --> 35:43.979
Sir, we've apprehended
the target, a civilian.

35:44.055 --> 35:45.488
Negative, Falcon patrol.

35:45.557 --> 35:47.525
Take him
with extreme caution.

36:09.147 --> 36:10.614
They're dead.

36:10.682 --> 36:12.582
(Max groaning)

36:25.830 --> 36:27.354
Max:
lt hurts. Stop.

36:27.432 --> 36:30.094
Why? Why? Why?

36:30.168 --> 36:31.795
lt hurts.

36:31.903 --> 36:33.097
Max?

36:33.204 --> 36:34.193
lt hurts.

36:34.305 --> 36:35.533
Stop. lt hurts.

36:35.640 --> 36:36.800
lt hurts. lt hurts.

36:36.908 --> 36:38.136
lt's all right.

36:38.209 --> 36:39.301
Stop it!

36:39.410 --> 36:40.741
...lt hurts.

36:40.812 --> 36:42.677
No, no, it's me they...

36:42.747 --> 36:44.078
They're coming for me.

36:44.148 --> 36:45.547
No, l know that...

36:45.617 --> 36:47.084
that's why they're here.

36:47.151 --> 36:48.618
They're coming for me.

36:48.686 --> 36:50.278
(helicopterwhirring)

36:50.355 --> 36:51.686
lt hurts.

36:51.756 --> 36:53.690
(moaning)

37:06.170 --> 37:07.967
Alpha team, secure the roof.

37:10.942 --> 37:12.603
Hold it right there!

37:12.677 --> 37:15.805
Putyour hands up
and come with us!

37:29.961 --> 37:32.020
Alpha team, ready on the roof.

37:33.731 --> 37:36.029
Roger, Alpha.
Delta team, report.

37:36.100 --> 37:38.000
Delta team in position, sir.

37:41.439 --> 37:42.736
What areyou doing?

37:42.807 --> 37:44.274
You have a very sick man
in there.

37:44.375 --> 37:46.843
We're not in the hospital now,
Dr. Scully.

37:46.945 --> 37:48.310
Omega team, report.

37:49.480 --> 37:51.778
He's a delusional
schizophrenic.

37:51.849 --> 37:54.181
Keep her clear.

37:54.252 --> 37:56.117
Sir, this is Alpha team leader.

37:56.187 --> 37:58.985
l'm picking up three forms
inside the structure.

37:59.057 --> 38:01.355
Henderson:
Did you say
three forms?

38:01.426 --> 38:03.018
That's affirmative.

38:04.262 --> 38:05.251
Two are proximate

38:05.296 --> 38:10.256
the third approaching
from 40 meters.

38:11.936 --> 38:16.771
All teams prepare for go
in 30 seconds.

38:16.841 --> 38:18.968
Come on. Come on, Max.

38:19.043 --> 38:21.034
Why... stop. Why...

38:21.112 --> 38:23.876
l'm here to helpyou.

38:23.948 --> 38:25.472
l'm scared.

38:25.550 --> 38:26.949
l know.

38:27.018 --> 38:28.280
Don't let them take me.

38:28.353 --> 38:30.651
Mulder:
l won't let them takeyou.

38:30.722 --> 38:31.518
Come on, Max.

38:31.589 --> 38:34.149
Come with me.

38:35.360 --> 38:36.327
No!

38:44.969 --> 38:46.266
Max!

38:53.277 --> 38:56.144
Max!

39:03.087 --> 39:04.987
Max!

39:12.463 --> 39:13.987
Max!

39:38.589 --> 39:40.580
Sir, this is Alpha team leader.

39:40.658 --> 39:41.920
Except for our men

39:41.993 --> 39:44.291
l'm only picking up
one figure inside.

39:44.362 --> 39:45.522
l do not copy that.

39:45.596 --> 39:46.995
We indicate only one figure

39:47.098 --> 39:48.929
inside the building.

39:49.033 --> 39:50.398
What?

39:50.468 --> 39:51.628
Soldier:
Blow the door!

39:54.939 --> 39:56.372
Take him!

39:58.710 --> 40:04.080
(soldiers chattering)

40:04.615 --> 40:05.912
That's your unit, sir.

40:09.320 --> 40:11.049
Where is he?

40:12.490 --> 40:16.290
He's gone.
They got to him first.

40:16.360 --> 40:18.351
They beat us, Colonel.

40:18.429 --> 40:20.397
Arrest him.

40:22.467 --> 40:24.435
And keep looking.

40:29.006 --> 40:30.405
Agent Scully

40:30.475 --> 40:34.571
to the best ofyour knowledge,
was Agent Mulder ever assigned

40:34.645 --> 40:37.842
to investigate matters
related to the evacuation

40:37.915 --> 40:39.473
ofTownsend, Wisconsin?

40:39.550 --> 40:40.812
No, sir.

40:40.885 --> 40:42.045
At any time

40:42.120 --> 40:44.680
wereyou aware ofhis
submitting a Form 302

40:44.756 --> 40:48.021
requesting said assignment
or travel expenses?

40:48.092 --> 40:49.559
No, sir.

40:49.627 --> 40:50.821
While in Wisconsin

40:50.895 --> 40:53.693
did Agent Mulder drive
a blue Ford Taurus

40:53.798 --> 40:57.962
registered to
the State Car rental agency?

40:58.069 --> 40:59.434
Yes, sir.

40:59.504 --> 41:01.301
Thankyou,
Agent Scully.

41:01.372 --> 41:04.102
Sir, request permission
to make a statement.

41:04.175 --> 41:05.540
Request denied.

41:05.610 --> 41:08.977
Sir, it's unfair tojudge Mulder
by the same criteria...

41:09.046 --> 41:10.240
You're dismissed.

41:10.314 --> 41:12.077
But, sir...

41:12.150 --> 41:14.880
That will be all.

41:25.730 --> 41:27.527
You hear that noise,
Scully?

41:27.632 --> 41:29.395
Hammer and nails.

41:29.500 --> 41:32.469
They're building a gallows
in the town square.

41:35.640 --> 41:37.471
Don't worry.

41:37.542 --> 41:39.442
lt was
only a matter oftime.

41:39.510 --> 41:42.775
l'm surprised
l lasted this long.

41:42.847 --> 41:44.838
Good luck.

41:44.916 --> 41:47.885
l'll break a leg.

42:06.804 --> 42:09.967
McGrath: ...as well as
insubordination and misconduct.

42:10.041 --> 42:14.205
How doyou respond to
these allegations, Agent Mulder?

42:14.278 --> 42:16.109
Over a dozen men
lost their lives

42:16.180 --> 42:18.808
and you want me to respond
to issues ofprotocol?

42:18.883 --> 42:21.943
You failed to obtain proper
authorization foryour actions.

42:22.019 --> 42:23.646
l knew it wouldn't
be forthcoming.

42:23.721 --> 42:25.655
You also violated
a Federal quarant...

42:25.723 --> 42:27.554
A cover-up was underway...

42:27.625 --> 42:29.718
Exposing yourself
and possibly others

42:29.794 --> 42:32.456
to toxic contamination!

42:32.530 --> 42:33.758
Oh, toxic contamination.
Are we back in that?

42:33.865 --> 42:34.991
You read my report.

42:35.099 --> 42:37.192
Explain Max Fenig's
disappearance.

42:37.301 --> 42:39.565
Your report is not the subject
ofthis inquiry.

42:39.637 --> 42:43.073
X rays taken while Mr. Fenig
was institutionalized

42:43.140 --> 42:46.041
showed an object
lodged in his cerebellum.

42:46.110 --> 42:48.078
That is irrelevant,
Agent Mulder.

42:48.145 --> 42:49.442
The man was abducted.

42:49.513 --> 42:51.378
Everybody in this room knows it.

42:51.449 --> 42:55.078
Colonel Henderson's
written testimony states

42:55.152 --> 42:58.849
that Fenig's body
was found two hours later

42:58.923 --> 43:00.914
in a cargo container.

43:05.863 --> 43:07.854
Then what can l say?

43:09.200 --> 43:11.668
How can l disprove lies
that are stamped

43:11.769 --> 43:13.066
with an official seal?

43:13.137 --> 43:14.900
That will be all,
Mr. Mulder.

43:14.972 --> 43:16.269
(sighing)

43:16.340 --> 43:18.706
You can deny all the things
l've seen

43:18.776 --> 43:22.234
all the things l've discovered,
but not for much longer

43:22.313 --> 43:25.180
'cause too many know
what's happening out there

43:25.249 --> 43:28.946
and no one,
no government agency

43:29.020 --> 43:31.386
hasjurisdiction
over the truth.

44:04.722 --> 44:07.282
Why did you countermand
our decision?

44:07.358 --> 44:09.849
Mulder's conduct
was in clearviolation

44:09.927 --> 44:13.226
not only of Bureau procedures,
but of Federal Law.

44:13.297 --> 44:14.321
Yes.

44:14.432 --> 44:15.626
l don't understand.

44:15.733 --> 44:18.031
The committee's case
was airtight.

44:18.102 --> 44:20.593
You've ruined the last
best chance we had

44:20.705 --> 44:21.933
to get rid ofhim.

44:22.006 --> 44:23.871
l appreciate
your frustration

44:23.941 --> 44:26.808
butyou and l both know
that Mulder's work--

44:26.877 --> 44:29.744
his, uh... singular passion--

44:29.814 --> 44:32.374
poses a most unique dilemma

44:32.450 --> 44:35.977
but his occasional
insubordination

44:36.053 --> 44:38.248
is in the end
far less dangerous.

44:38.322 --> 44:39.949
With respect, sir--

44:40.024 --> 44:41.651
less dangerous than what?

44:41.726 --> 44:45.127
Than having him exposed
to the wrong people--

44:45.196 --> 44:47.221
what he knows...

44:47.331 --> 44:50.027
what he thinks he knows.

44:50.134 --> 44:52.659
(sighing)

44:52.770 --> 44:58.140
Always keepyour friends
close, Mr. McGrath

44:58.209 --> 45:01.201
but keepyour enemies closer.
