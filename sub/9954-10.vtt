I'm glad he's happy.

13:20.550 --> 13:21.926
[Sighs]

13:22.052 --> 13:24.634
Haven is better
without the troubles.

13:26.056 --> 13:28.843
Here's what you don't know.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.807
Deep down...

13:30.936 --> 13:33.769
you like the troubles.

13:33.897 --> 13:36.058
Hell, you want the troubles.

13:36.191 --> 13:38.227
I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:38.360 --> 13:41.272
No, you don't, but you will.

13:41.405 --> 13:43.566
And if you're not gonna help me
bring the old Haven back...

13:44.574 --> 13:46.439
[Sighs]

13:46.576 --> 13:50.068
...then I'm gonna
have to do it myself.

13:50.205 --> 13:53.743
And I won't be delicate about it.

13:55.794 --> 13:58.126
Don't get too comfortable being here.

14:09.891 --> 14:13.349
I won't do it.
It's irresponsible.

14:13.478 --> 14:14.593
We could incite panic.

14:14.730 --> 14:17.767
lf Haven is being overrun
by homeless bag ladies,

14:17.899 --> 14:19.480
the people have a right to know!

14:19.609 --> 14:22.146
—Vincent.
—|t's our journalistic duty.

14:22.279 --> 14:23.815
Since when are we journalists?

14:23.947 --> 14:25.653
[Bell jingles]

14:26.408 --> 14:27.989
Oh.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.699
Afternoon, fellas.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.784
Oh, is this about placing an ad?

14:31.913 --> 14:34.370
I'm sorry, but we're in the middle
of chasing a story.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.660
Oh, sounds exciting.

14:36.793 --> 14:39.660
No, I'm looking
for someone actually,

14:39.796 --> 14:42.583
and I know you guys know everyone,
so I thought maybe you could help.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.377
l'm awfully sorry,

14:44.509 --> 14:48.468
but we don't have
a "missed connection" section

14:48.597 --> 14:49.803
here at the Herald.

14:49.931 --> 14:53.059
Well, I'm sure
you'll be able to help...

14:53.185 --> 14:57.144
one way or another.

15:01.610 --> 15:03.396
Hey.

15:03.528 --> 15:04.904
Hi ——
No, that's fine.

15:05.530 --> 15:10.524
I didn't think you'd call,
but, um, I'm glad you did.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.867
Did you find your friend
that you were looking for?

15:12.996 --> 15:14.657
Not exactly.

15:15.332 --> 15:18.495
You know,
I meant what I said earlier.

15:18.627 --> 15:19.707
I really do wanna help you.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.952
That's why I'm here.

15:22.089 --> 15:25.206
Listen, Haven has a big problem.

15:25.342 --> 15:28.675
You have seen the signs, right?
This is the safest town in ——

15:28.804 --> 15:32.046
No. There's a situation
that you need to be aware of.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.047
There is a man,
he's extremely dangerous,

15:34.184 --> 15:36.345
and I don't think that you're ready
for whatever he's planning.

15:36.478 --> 15:40.517
Whoa, I know
that we are a small town,

15:40.649 --> 15:41.855
but I know how to do myjob.

15:41.983 --> 15:43.723
Listen, that's not what I meant,
all right?

15:43.860 --> 15:45.725
H.P.D. needs to take precautions.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.602
You can't just be on defense
with this guy.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.775
He's always a step ahead.
I can help you.

15:49.908 --> 15:52.365
I can help you find him,
|.D. him, bring him in.

15:52.494 --> 15:54.075
Okay.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.827
I think I know what's going on.

15:56.957 --> 15:58.447
You think I'm Barney Fife

15:58.583 --> 16:02.167
because you are
law enforcement, too.

16:02.295 --> 16:07.085
You know, I found an Audrey Parker
in the FBI.

16:07.217 --> 16:08.957
But it wasn't you.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.260

—Oh.

16:15.225 --> 16:17.682
Listen, I know this guy.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.221
All right, who is he?

16:19.354 --> 16:21.060
His name is William.

16:21.189 --> 16:22.224
William.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.899
Does William have a last name?

16:26.611 --> 16:29.102
—[ Chuckles]
—Right.

16:29.239 --> 16:30.695

16:30.824 --> 16:32.530
Excuse me,
l have to take this.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.991
Yeah, this is Detective Crocker.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.160
I'll be right there.

16:41.293 --> 16:42.908
[Phone beeps]

16:43.962 --> 16:45.293
What's wrong?

16:45.422 --> 16:48.459
Haven just had its first murder
in 42 years.

16:49.384 --> 16:51.170
You knew this was gonna happen.

16:51.303 --> 16:52.463
Who's the victim?

16:52.596 --> 16:55.087
You can see for yourself.

17:01.605 --> 17:03.095
Vince.

17:03.648 --> 17:05.559
Oh.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.774
And Dave.

17:07.903 --> 17:10.736
I saw you talking
to the two of them earlier.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.946
You knew them?

17:14.201 --> 17:15.691
In a way.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.449
Looks like Vince
was taken by surprise.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.790
Dave fought back.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.706
[Sighs]

17:29.966 --> 17:31.957
He was a tough old guy.

17:50.487 --> 17:52.227
Blonde hair.

17:52.364 --> 17:54.400
William.

17:54.532 --> 17:58.491
Listen, he is trying
to set me up, okay?

17:58.620 --> 17:59.860
He planted that there.

17:59.996 --> 18:02.908
H can explain everything.

18:03.041 --> 18:05.202
Yeah.
And you will.

18:07.128 --> 18:08.709
Get up.

18:08.838 --> 18:12.831
Audrey Parker,
you're under arrest.

18:16.179 --> 18:17.794
We both know you don't have
enough to charge me,

18:17.931 --> 18:20.217
and you can't hold me here
indefinitely.

18:20.350 --> 18:23.012
Well, Audrey Parker,
I wouldn't have to hold you at all

18:23.144 --> 18:25.055
if you'd just be straight with me.

18:25.981 --> 18:29.394
Who are you,
and what are you doing here?

18:29.526 --> 18:30.732
Truth, huh?

18:33.697 --> 18:37.235
Listen, what I'm about to tell you
is gonna sound really ——

18:37.367 --> 18:39.073
Crazy.
Yeah, I got it.

18:39.202 --> 18:43.866
This whole world ——
This isn't right.

18:45.208 --> 18:49.247
My Haven, the real Haven,
people can do things,

18:49.379 --> 18:52.462
supernatural things,
and we call them troubles.

18:52.966 --> 18:57.676
So somebody's trouble turned
everything into what it is now.

18:59.556 --> 19:01.512
And only you know about this?

19:01.641 --> 19:03.427
Yes.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.436
And William.

19:05.562 --> 19:07.518
And he's killing people
to find the troubled person

19:07.647 --> 19:09.888
who can change this back.

19:10.942 --> 19:13.149
William, right.

19:14.487 --> 19:19.151
Look... I tried to help you.

19:20.910 --> 19:23.447
But this ——
This is too much.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.116
Okay, Duke, I know you.

19:25.248 --> 19:27.614
In my Haven,
you're —— you're the criminal.

19:27.751 --> 19:29.992
[ Scoffs ]
Please.

19:30.128 --> 19:33.541
Yes, with the same long hair,
and you —— you do what you want.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.289
You live on a boat,
for God's sake.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.337
—A boat?
—Yeah.

19:38.887 --> 19:41.594
And we're friends.

19:41.723 --> 19:43.463
We trust each other.

19:49.272 --> 19:52.264
[Phone vibrates]

19:57.322 --> 19:59.313
We got another body.

20:00.492 --> 20:03.655
Does the name Doreen Hanscomb
mean anything to you?

20:03.787 --> 20:05.368
Yes.

20:05.497 --> 20:08.284
In my Haven,
she was William's last experiment.

20:08.416 --> 20:10.532
He must have thought that
she caused this with her trouble,

20:10.668 --> 20:11.703
but he was wrong.

20:11.836 --> 20:14.748
Everything's still the same,
so he killed her.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.247
—l've heard enough.
—No, listen!

20:17.384 --> 20:19.170
I'm not crazy, all right?
He's still out there!

20:19.302 --> 20:20.758
He'll keep doing this!

20:36.653 --> 20:37.768
Hey.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.020
—Detective Crocker.
—Dr. Hansen.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.737
—Mm—hmm.
—You're my M.E. today.

20:41.866 --> 20:43.857
—Yes.
—Nice to meet you.

20:43.993 --> 20:46.609
Uh, we've met, actually.

—Oh.
—Do you remember?

Third grade.
Mrs. Pryal's class.

20:52.836 --> 20:56.829
You stole my Han Solo lunchbox.

20:56.965 --> 21:02.085
And I would like to file
a formal report and ——

21:02.220 --> 21:03.960
—[ Clears throat]
—|'m just kidding.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.179
I like to joke, l'm ——

21:07.350 --> 21:11.935
You may remember that I broke
my arm that year, uh, sledding.

21:12.063 --> 21:13.724
Had to be reset twice,
hurt like hell.

21:13.857 --> 21:16.394
That is part of the reason
that I became a doctor.

21:16.526 --> 21:19.563
Okay, if I say that I remember you,
will you stop talking?

21:19.696 --> 21:22.312
—[Laughs]
—Just kidding.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.690
You —— you like to joke.

21:24.826 --> 21:26.441
Um...

21:26.578 --> 21:27.442
[Sighs]

21:27.579 --> 21:31.913
So I guess I got the short straw
at the hospital today.

21:32.917 --> 21:36.535
What would it take to get
a full—time ME. in this town?

21:37.380 --> 21:39.666
Well, a lot more murders.

21:40.925 --> 21:44.793
Doc, you signed off on a woman
earlier today, Audrey Parker.

21:44.929 --> 21:48.092
You notice anything off about her?

21:48.224 --> 21:50.055
No comment.

21:55.273 --> 21:56.558
I'm just ——

21:56.691 --> 21:59.023
She seemed —— she seemed
to have a thing for doctors,

21:59.152 --> 22:01.143
but she checked out fine.

22:01.946 --> 22:04.688
Yeah, well, there's no record of her
in any system anywhere.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.531
Oh, why are you
so interested in her?

22:08.286 --> 22:10.072
No comment.

22:13.249 --> 22:15.080
Knock, knock.

22:15.210 --> 22:16.666
You got a visitor.

22:16.794 --> 22:18.079
It's your lawyer.

22:18.922 --> 22:20.162
I don't have a lawyer.

22:21.716 --> 22:23.331
No, no, it's him!

22:23.468 --> 22:25.379
Arrest him!
He's the murderer!

22:25.512 --> 22:28.424
—You said she'd try that one.
—I know, right?

22:28.556 --> 22:29.762
Wish me luck.

22:31.935 --> 22:34.972
I told him you were delusional.
[Chuckles]

22:35.104 --> 22:36.310
Oh, come on.

22:36.439 --> 22:38.976
Is that any way to look
at the only person like you

22:39.108 --> 22:40.359
that you've ever met?

22:40.485 --> 22:42.476
lam nothing like you.

22:42.612 --> 22:44.523
I know this is hard,
but someday,

22:44.656 --> 22:47.648
you're gonna look back on this
and laugh.

22:47.784 --> 22:49.649
—Laugh?
—Yeah.

22:49.786 --> 22:51.322
You killed Vince and Dave.

22:51.454 --> 22:53.160
I thought they'd lead me
to the troubled person.

22:53.289 --> 22:55.200
[Groans sarcastically]
My bad.

22:55.333 --> 22:58.951
Ah, and then Doreen.
You thought it was her.

22:59.087 --> 23:01.078
Yeah.

23:01.214 --> 23:02.795
Not her.

23:03.633 --> 23:05.874
And now I'm back to square one.

Thing is...
[Clears throat]

23:09.722 --> 23:11.974

and the clues and the ——

23:14.852 --> 23:17.559

It's just so time—consuming.

23:17.689 --> 23:20.351
But I know someone
who's really good at it.

23:20.483 --> 23:22.690
Audrey Parker.

23:22.819 --> 23:26.778
So you are gonna help me
find the troubled person.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.316
No.

23:28.449 --> 23:30.906
I wouldn't help you,
not in this world or any other.

23:31.035 --> 23:33.196
Yeah, you will,

more people are gonna die.

cares about.

23:41.588 --> 23:42.703
Don't do this.

23:42.839 --> 23:44.045
This is for your good.

23:44.173 --> 23:47.301
And for you,
I will do whatever it takes.

23:47.427 --> 23:50.385
So I'm gonna give myself
a little head start

'cause you're a little cranky today.

23:53.141 --> 23:54.381
Guard!

23:54.517 --> 23:57.350
So, when you get out of here,
I'd hop to it.

23:59.188 --> 24:01.179
Good talk.

24:02.150 --> 24:03.731
Thanks.

24:09.699 --> 24:12.691
l've examined the body
and, well, it wasn't an accident.

24:12.827 --> 24:15.660
The killer broke her neck.

24:15.788 --> 24:18.165
How do you know
it wasn't an accident?

24:19.709 --> 24:21.916
That's how.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.346
"Nother."

24:35.516 --> 24:37.302
What do you think it means?

24:38.561 --> 24:41.268
I think it means "not her".

24:43.191 --> 24:44.271
Hmm.

24:46.527 --> 24:48.563
She wasn't killed here. They ——

24:48.696 --> 24:51.733
Somebody dumped the body.

25:46.254 --> 25:47.710
Honey? Marie?

25:48.631 --> 25:50.622
Marie?

25:50.758 --> 25:52.134
He|——

25:54.303 --> 25:56.885
Guess she hung up.

25:57.932 --> 25:59.718
Well, it's been great
working with you.

25:59.851 --> 26:02.467
I think we make a very good team.

26:04.147 --> 26:07.355
Come on.
Your hold is up.

26:07.483 --> 26:10.020
Your lawyer says
that we have to let you go.

26:10.153 --> 26:12.565
All right, Stan,
if that lawyer comes back here,

26:12.697 --> 26:14.528
don't trust him.

26:14.657 --> 26:16.193
Okay.

26:17.160 --> 26:18.866
Get some help.

26:18.995 --> 26:21.236
Nut job.

26:22.290 --> 26:25.657
Wow, Nathan, nice house.

26:26.169 --> 26:28.376
Oh, thank God
you're all right.

[Chuckles]

26:32.467 --> 26:34.207
—You.
—What's wrong?

26:34.343 --> 26:36.550
Okay, whatever you want right now,
I can't.

26:36.679 --> 26:38.215
—My family is missing.
—What's ——

—That's my wife.
—Good.

26:47.231 --> 26:48.061
Thank God.

26:48.775 --> 26:51.437
Hi, honey, I ——

26:51.569 --> 26:52.684
Who is this?

26:57.074 --> 26:59.030
lt's someone named William.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.526
He wants to talk to you.

27:05.249 --> 27:06.659
William, don't hurt his family.

27:06.793 --> 27:09.409
Well, that part's up to you, Audrey.

27:09.545 --> 27:11.536
You find me the troubled person
that did this Haven,

27:11.672 --> 27:13.128
and I'll give the Hansens back.

27:13.257 --> 27:15.589
The Hansens are innocent, all right?
What do you want with them?

27:15.718 --> 27:17.879
Well, you made it clear to me
that you'd sacrifice your happiness

27:18.012 --> 27:18.922
by staying here.

27:19.055 --> 27:22.923
But I'm guessing you won't sacrifice
Nathan's happiness.

27:23.059 --> 27:26.893
Find the troubled person
or the Hansens die.

27:27.021 --> 27:28.932
See you soon.
[Phone beeps]

27:29.065 --> 27:30.475
It went well.

27:31.359 --> 27:33.270
What the hell is going on?

Okay, we don't have time for that.

27:37.698 --> 27:39.108
You cannot call the cops, okay?

27:39.242 --> 27:41.028
—What?
—Wi||iam wants to deal with me.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.697
Anything you do is gonna put
your family in jeopardy.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.240
Who are you?

27:45.373 --> 27:47.364
How am I supposed to trust you?

27:47.500 --> 27:49.115
You don't have any other choice!

27:49.252 --> 27:52.744
The person that William's
looking for, we need to find him.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.416
Who?
Who is he looking for?

27:54.549 --> 27:58.007
The person he's looking for
is...special.

27:58.135 --> 28:01.627
They may view this Haven
as different or even bad.

28:01.764 --> 28:05.177
Is there anything weird
you've noticed here lately?

28:05.309 --> 28:07.925
Weird? Is there anything
that seems weird?

28:08.062 --> 28:11.145
Uh, you mean other
than the three murders

28:11.274 --> 28:13.686
and the fact that my wife
and daughter have been kidnapped?

28:13.818 --> 28:14.853
There was nothing weird in Haven.

28:14.986 --> 28:17.853
There was no crime in Haven
until you came.

28:17.989 --> 28:19.479
Yeah, except for the vandalism.

28:19.615 --> 28:22.527
Vandalism? What?
Since when?

28:22.660 --> 28:23.820
Wait, so that's new?

28:23.953 --> 28:24.988
What?

28:27.331 --> 28:28.616
Are these your flyers?

28:28.749 --> 28:30.705
What? Who cares?

28:32.503 --> 28:34.835
Yeah. Susie.

28:34.964 --> 28:37.831
In the old Haven,
she was injured in an explosion.

28:37.967 --> 28:39.173
Where I'm from,
she's married to Cliff.

28:39.302 --> 28:40.667
But here she's with this guy.

28:40.803 --> 28:43.385
His face was scratched out
on one of their signs.

28:43.514 --> 28:46.381
I need to talk to Susie.
There's an open house.

28:46.517 --> 28:47.506
—Open house.
—O——

28:47.643 --> 28:49.679
We gotta get to this open house.

28:49.812 --> 28:52.349
We're going to an open house?

28:52.481 --> 28:55.518
I don't care that her hold was up!
Do you understand that?

28:55.651 --> 28:58.233
She was my only lead!

29:00.907 --> 29:02.568
Get out of my way.

[ Scoffs ]

29:22.929 --> 29:25.716

it's the time to jump in.

29:25.848 --> 29:29.432
The Haven real estate market
has never been hotter.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.721
Look, there he is again.

29:31.854 --> 29:33.264
Who is that guy?

29:33.397 --> 29:35.228
And why does he
keep following us around?

29:35.358 --> 29:36.222
Cliff.

29:36.359 --> 29:39.772
Look, just wait, okay?
l'll handle this.

Yeah, I do, and |——
I know that you're troubled.

| always thought it was some
dumb family joke, but it's real.

29:56.879 --> 29:58.585
Yeah.

29:58.714 --> 29:59.920
What happened?

30:00.049 --> 30:02.381
Susie got hurt back in old Haven

30:02.510 --> 30:05.092
because of the volcano troubles,
remember?

30:05.221 --> 30:07.382
Right.

30:07.515 --> 30:10.848
Well, she died later that night.

30:12.895 --> 30:15.261
So I wished for the troubles
to go away.

30:15.398 --> 30:17.389
I mean, it's just something you say,
right?

30:17.525 --> 30:21.438
I never thought it would happen,
but then, poof.

30:21.570 --> 30:23.310
Trouble—free Haven.

30:23.447 --> 30:25.984
So w—wait, you just wished
the troubles away?

30:26.117 --> 30:27.653
Yeah.

30:27.785 --> 30:30.401
My family always said
there's a dark side to every wish.

30:30.538 --> 30:33.701
They were right
because she's alive again,

30:33.833 --> 30:35.869
but she doesn't even know
that I exist.

30:36.002 --> 30:39.369
Now she thinks
I'm some kind of creep.

| just wanted to see her again.

30:43.926 --> 30:46.258
Why don't you just try wishing
for something different?

30:46.387 --> 30:48.548
That could make things worse
than they already are.

30:48.681 --> 30:52.424
It's like playing Russian Roulette.
The wishes come with a downside.

30:52.560 --> 30:53.925
Right.

30:54.061 --> 30:56.438
At least she's alive again,

30:56.564 --> 30:58.145
and, well,
it looks like she's happy,

30:58.274 --> 31:00.435
even if it's without me.

31:00.568 --> 31:06.063
But wait. Cliff, what happens if ——
if something happens to you?

31:06.198 --> 31:08.029
What happens
to this version of Haven?

31:08.159 --> 31:10.320

I have some sort of manual.

all right?

We're gonna keep you safe.

31:14.457 --> 31:16.322
Okay, what are we doing?

31:16.459 --> 31:18.165
Are we making
some kind of exchange?

No, we can't do that.

—My family ——
—I will get them back.

all William wants is me, so ——

that I am the cop here.

32:16.185 --> 32:19.018

to one common denominator,

Okay, I tried to warn you.

that to our advantage.

where is Hansen taking him?

32:44.213 --> 32:45.999
—To William.
—Okay.

—You still got a signal?
—I sure do.

to track him.

on the case details in the car.

over and over?

Why do you think you're the one
who has to deal with the troubles?

because we did it together,

38:11.123 --> 38:13.785
—Oh.
—Hey, you okay?

38:16.670 --> 38:17.910
What happened?

38:18.046 --> 38:19.547
William.

38:20.841 --> 38:23.082
We need to kill him.

38:26.472 --> 38:29.305
I'm just glad that you're still alive.

38:29.433 --> 38:30.923
Vince and Dave, too, of course.

38:31.059 --> 38:33.766
—l was a cop.
—Yeah, a really good one.

38:33.896 --> 38:36.103
—And William shot me?
—Mm—hmm, point—blank.

38:37.524 --> 38:39.264
Yeah, I'm gonna get a bigger gun.

38:44.364 --> 38:46.821
Susie died of complications
last night.

38:46.950 --> 38:48.110
They found cliff shot dead.

38:48.243 --> 38:50.780
William got to him before
he could untrouble Haven again.

38:50.913 --> 38:52.278
Sorry.

38:52.414 --> 38:53.995
William can't get away with this.

38:54.124 --> 38:55.910
Well, we know
he's somewhere in Haven.

38:56.043 --> 38:57.749
Did you find out anything new
about him?

38:58.504 --> 39:01.416
No. Nothing.

39:03.592 --> 39:07.335
But Detective Crocker did mention
that he found fiberglass

39:07.471 --> 39:09.177
on William's last victim.

39:09.306 --> 39:11.297
It was ——
It was an industrial grade,

39:11.433 --> 39:15.802
like the kind
that you build boats with.

39:15.938 --> 39:17.269
Which gets me thinking...

39:17.397 --> 39:19.433
Maybe he's using the same hideout.

39:19.566 --> 39:22.478
—Yeah.
—Boathouse or repair shop.

39:24.321 --> 39:26.357
Fiberglass boat repair.

39:27.491 --> 39:29.197
Okay, there's only three in the area.

39:29.326 --> 39:31.157
Well, he wouldn't wanna risk
getting caught.

39:31.286 --> 39:33.868
Which one's the furthest
from where they found Doreen?

39:33.997 --> 39:37.160
Danny's Dry Dock,
but, God, there's no number.

39:37.292 --> 39:39.829
That is because it's a cover.

39:39.962 --> 39:41.122
Yeah.

39:41.255 --> 39:44.463
Old man Jessup, he dries out
his weed harvest there once a year.

39:45.801 --> 39:47.666
—What? It's not my job to arrest him.
—Uh—huh.

39:47.803 --> 39:49.009
Growing season's over.

39:49.137 --> 39:50.513
That makes it the perfect hideout.

39:50.639 --> 39:52.379
Nice work, Detective Crocker.

39:52.975 --> 39:54.181
That hurts me.

39:54.309 --> 39:55.924
Okay, come on, guys.
Let's go.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.892
—Shotgun.
—Shotgun.

40:14.705 --> 40:16.912
Hey!
[Guns cock]

40:17.040 --> 40:21.249
Well, I thought you'd wanna
finish our conversation.

40:21.378 --> 40:23.039
Just didn't think
we'd have an audience.

40:23.171 --> 40:25.036
I didn't come here to talk.

40:25.173 --> 40:26.788
No.

40:28.343 --> 40:29.207
[Sighs]

40:32.264 --> 40:33.800
You don't wanna shoot me.

40:33.932 --> 40:36.924
Hey,paL
She really does.

40:37.060 --> 40:38.891
But not for the reason you think.

40:40.355 --> 40:43.893
Let me guess.
You didn't tell 'em.

40:44.026 --> 40:47.234
Well, they have a right to know.

40:47.904 --> 40:49.565
Don't you think?

40:49.698 --> 40:52.189
—About us?
—Shut up!

40:57.205 --> 40:59.742
I like you guys.

40:59.875 --> 41:04.414
So I'm gonna tell you
everything you wanna know

41:04.546 --> 41:07.879
about who she is
and what she's done.

41:08.550 --> 41:09.960
Sorry.

41:10.093 --> 41:13.256
What we did.

41:13.388 --> 41:14.924
Together.

41:15.057 --> 41:20.097
'Cause we are so connected.

41:21.271 --> 41:23.887
No!
[Gasps]

41:25.275 --> 41:26.890
Audrey.

41:28.403 --> 41:29.438
What the ——

41:32.282 --> 41:33.943
You're all right, babe.

41:34.076 --> 41:36.237
What the hell's happening?

41:38.664 --> 41:41.997
It's the same wound.
They are connected.

41:46.463 --> 41:48.920
Parker. Parker.
