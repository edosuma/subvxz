00:47.080 --> 00:50.721
The army has recruited
the Spanish colonial army of Morocco.

00:52.680 --> 00:55.001
This is an announcement
from your government

00:55.000 --> 00:57.321
There has been a military uprising.

01:04.640 --> 01:07.928
One, two. One, two. One, two.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.410
Surrender

01:09.400 --> 01:11.084
- Ready 
- Surrender

01:11.080 --> 01:13.162
Aim. Fire!

02:01.480 --> 02:03.482
I was a war baby

02:04.680 --> 02:06.728
But luckily for me, I haven't had to fight ..

02:06.720 --> 02:11.169
in any of the 765 wars
that have occurred in my lifetime.

02:12.160 --> 02:14.561
My father wasn't so lucky

02:15.840 --> 02:17.569
When he was a young man,

02:17.560 --> 02:20.803
everyone in Spain had
to take sides and take up arms.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.406
The decision may have taken a second,

02:24.400 --> 02:27.768
but the consequences lasted 
the rest of his life.

02:29.080 --> 02:31.731
He never talked about the war...

02:31.720 --> 02:35.406
until I was asked to write a book
about a dead priest -

02:35.400 --> 02:37.687
Josemaría Escrivá.

02:37.680 --> 02:41.969
And then he began to talk and talk and talk.

02:44.280 --> 02:48.649
And that's how I went looking for a saint
and found my father instead.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.924
I think it was Oscar Wilde who wrote,

02:54.920 --> 02:57.287
'Every saint has a past

02:57.280 --> 03:00.363
and every sinner has a future. ”

03:07.560 --> 03:08.721
Josemaría!

03:08.720 --> 03:10.961
It's the Father. Quick!

03:10.960 --> 03:12.962
Quick! Get the doctor!

03:32.800 --> 03:34.962
In June of 1976,

03:34.960 --> 03:37.531
the nun was at the point of death,

03:37.520 --> 03:43.050
Diagnosed with a multiple
calcific lipomatosis tumor, causing pain,

03:43.040 --> 03:48.729
attaining a mass the size of an orange
on the left shoulder.

03:48.720 --> 03:52.611
Cured in a sudden and lasting way...

03:52.600 --> 03:58.607
after the Servant of God, Josemaría Escrivá,

03:58.600 --> 04:01.331
had been invoked.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.686
You have reached Judge Manolo Torres.

04:13.680 --> 04:16.843
Leave a message.

04:16.839 --> 04:21.004
Dad? It's- It's me, Robert.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.843
Your son.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.683
I'm in Rome.

04:24.680 --> 04:27.286
I'm doing a book on Josemaría Escrivá.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.851
I'm- I'm coming to Madrid, Dad,

04:30.840 --> 04:34.811
and, you know, I-I want
to talk to you about him.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.325
Are you there?

04:36.320 --> 04:39.164
Please, Dad, pick up the phone.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.522
Okay Well I'll call you when I arrive.

04:48.880 --> 04:51.645
And why this interest in Escrivá?

04:51.640 --> 04:57.283
The uproar in the press about his possible
canonization turned my publisher on.

04:58.560 --> 05:01.245
You know, and curiously, he-

05:01.240 --> 05:03.891
he came from the same town as my father.

05:03.880 --> 05:07.680
Ah, yes, of course.
How is the judge, Roberto?

05:07.680 --> 05:10.047
To be honest, I-

05:10.040 --> 05:12.088
We haven't spoken in...

05:12.080 --> 05:13.844
eight years.

05:15.400 --> 05:18.722
So I moved to London permanently,
and since then-

05:18.720 --> 05:21.530
Well, he's not very forgiving,
my father.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.090
Eight years, huh?

05:23.080 --> 05:25.208
- Children?
- No.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.407
I don't quite see myself as a father.

05:28.920 --> 05:31.161
Your father is a product of difficult times.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.242
You should try to understand him.

05:33.240 --> 05:35.925
Well, I do, Monsignor. I do.

05:35.920 --> 05:38.491
God bless you in your quest.

05:38.480 --> 05:41.051
- And give my regards to, uh-
- To Leila.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.088
Leila.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.969
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

05:52.320 --> 05:54.607
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

05:55.680 --> 05:59.321
That's Josemaría Escrivá in the middle.

05:59.320 --> 06:01.766
And that's me on the right.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.730
And on the left, your father.

06:05.840 --> 06:08.844
Here's another one. At the seminary.

06:12.520 --> 06:14.090
Hello.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.560
Dad. I'm in Madrid.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.085
Been a long time.

06:18.080 --> 06:22.608
Listen. I'm close to the apartment,
and I wanted to come see you.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.921
Why would you write a book about him?

06:24.920 --> 06:27.161
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

06:27.160 --> 06:29.208
Leave it alone, Roberto.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.726
Well, I found out that you were
in the seminary with him,

06:31.720 --> 06:34.530
and you never told me
that you wanted to be a priest.

06:34.520 --> 06:38.002
- Don't you think that's weird?
- Yes, I thought so too.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.446
That's why I left after a year, Roberto.

06:40.440 --> 06:43.171
Why? Was it because of the civil war?

07:00.680 --> 07:02.728
Hello.. London University

07:02.720 --> 07:05.121
Dr. Leila Azoulay, please.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.804
Which department?

07:06.800 --> 07:08.928
Mathematical Physics.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.571
Good timing.
I was just about to call you.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.324
How's Spain ?

07:13.320 --> 07:14.810
I love Spain.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.962
How's your father?

07:16.960 --> 07:18.849
I love Spain.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.490
Tell me.

07:22.480 --> 07:25.609
He doesn't want me to do
this Josemaría Escrivá thing.

07:25.600 --> 07:28.206
At least you two spoke. That's progress, no?

07:28.200 --> 07:30.931
He knows something
about Josemaría, damn it.

07:30.920 --> 07:34.686
I know he does. Why can't he just tell me?

07:34.680 --> 07:38.127
I could wrangle the weekend away.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.726
Want me to come out?

08:10.120 --> 08:12.282
Gun.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.765
No!

08:27.240 --> 08:28.765
Damn it.

09:09.480 --> 09:14.168
I was nine when Josemaría's 
path crossed mine.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.846
A long time ago.

09:17.840 --> 09:22.482
Roberto, you've often told me
that I was a terrible father

09:22.480 --> 09:25.529
What I've never told you
is that I agree with you.

09:25.520 --> 09:29.605
- Manolo! Manolo! 
-There is so much I haven't told you 
that you need to know

09:29.600 --> 09:32.285
- So if you want to hear about the past
- Manolo!

09:32.280 --> 09:33.805
- I'll tell you.
- Manolo!

09:33.800 --> 09:37.930
- But I warn you, there be dragons.
- Manolo! Manolo!

09:37.920 --> 09:39.888
Are you okay? Manolo!

09:39.880 --> 09:41.370
Manolo!

09:41.360 --> 09:43.283
You got me.

09:43.280 --> 09:46.170
- I got you, Josemaría.
- I was a little terror like most boys.

09:46.160 --> 09:49.130
- I'm gonna get you.
- Josemaría was no saint either

09:49.120 --> 09:51.487
There was one day he almost killed me.

09:54.680 --> 09:57.923
Good driving, boy. Come on!

10:14.480 --> 10:17.723
Feels like a Taurus, Manolo.
Faster!

10:25.760 --> 10:27.603
Stop!

10:27.600 --> 10:30.729
- Manolo, are you all right?
- Are you mad?

10:30.720 --> 10:34.327
Josemaría, I'll speak to your father.
He should give you a beating.

10:34.320 --> 10:37.005
I hate this backwater.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.561
I've half a mind to sell up
and go back to Madrid, I promise.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.924
- Can I drive again, Papa?
- No, Manolo. Enough.

11:03.280 --> 11:05.442
Here is the first one.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.205
See?

11:09.200 --> 11:12.921
There are many kinds of dragons
you will have to face.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.649
She scares me.

11:14.640 --> 11:17.325
Don't be scared, Manolo.

11:17.320 --> 11:20.324
How many dragons are there, Abileyza?

11:20.320 --> 11:22.209
Many, Josemaría.

11:22.200 --> 11:25.886
But what matters is how you face them,
as you shall see.

11:25.880 --> 11:29.441
Josemaría's nanny talked about dragons...

11:29.440 --> 11:31.841
as if they really existed

11:31.840 --> 11:36.846
A quarter of a century passed
before I realized she was right

11:38.000 --> 11:40.765
But things happened in Josemaría's life...

11:40.760 --> 11:44.731
that meant he understood this before I did.

11:47.800 --> 11:51.202
Why?

11:53.440 --> 11:57.843
No!

12:08.160 --> 12:10.640
My baby! Why?

12:43.120 --> 12:45.771
Josemaría lost three sisters.

12:46.760 --> 12:49.331
I lost a baby brother.

12:49.320 --> 12:51.971
In those days, death was part of life.

13:04.160 --> 13:05.844
Mama?

13:06.840 --> 13:09.207
Do you hate God now?

13:09.200 --> 13:11.646
No, dearest.

13:16.600 --> 13:19.729
I... love him very much.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.721
Will you hate him when he takes me away?

13:25.840 --> 13:27.410
Come here.

13:46.080 --> 13:48.401
I'm sorry about your sister.

13:48.400 --> 13:52.849
Josemaría's father
owned a chocolate factory

13:52.840 --> 13:56.208
The manager was a strange, old guy-

13:56.200 --> 13:57.770
Honorio.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.922
We know we like what's here.

13:59.920 --> 14:02.446
We know that we want what's here.

14:02.440 --> 14:05.171
But what is here exactly?

14:05.160 --> 14:09.290
Just sit this on your tongue...

14:11.320 --> 14:13.129
for five seconds.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.285
Hmm? Now, chew...

14:18.280 --> 14:19.770
three times.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.488
Manolo, you taste what?

14:27.480 --> 14:29.403
Almond.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.129
Almond?

14:34.760 --> 14:35.841
Cinnamon.

14:35.840 --> 14:36.921
Cinnamon?

14:37.440 --> 14:39.329
Don't scoff.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.329
Yes. Cinnamon.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.606
All right, off you go.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.602
Josemaría, you stay here.

14:53.960 --> 14:58.887
I scolded Manolo for mocking
what he can't experience,

14:58.880 --> 15:02.646
not because he couldn't experience it.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.644
Ah, now, look at this.

15:05.640 --> 15:07.324
Ugly, isn't it?

15:07.320 --> 15:10.369
Just a poor, ordinary little bean.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.528
Yet, patience,

15:13.520 --> 15:17.844
skill, hard work and love...

15:17.840 --> 15:22.323
can unleash the divine flavors
hidden within.

15:22.320 --> 15:23.845
There.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.049
Do you understand the lesson?

15:30.360 --> 15:34.160
But not everyone has a taste
for the divine, you know.

15:36.080 --> 15:38.367
And why is that, I wonder?

15:41.480 --> 15:43.005
Manolo!

15:43.000 --> 15:45.571
Manolo! Wait for me!

15:45.560 --> 15:47.210
Stop! Manolo!

15:47.200 --> 15:49.328
My favorite trick in those days...

15:49.320 --> 15:52.529
was stealing Josemaría's dad's chocolates.

15:52.520 --> 15:56.809
But then his dad went bankrupt
and lost the chocolate factory

15:56.800 --> 16:01.203
And I wasn't allowed to play
with Josemaría any more.

16:01.200 --> 16:04.170
My dad thought poverty was contagious.

16:04.160 --> 16:06.288
- He said' that Josemaría wasn't one of us. 
- One!

16:06.280 --> 16:07.805
Two!

16:07.800 --> 16:11.361
- And my dad could be quite persuasive.
- Three!

16:14.440 --> 16:16.442
My dad had more money,

16:16.440 --> 16:20.240
more cars, more houses.

16:20.240 --> 16:23.289
But Josemaría had more dad.

16:24.240 --> 16:27.562
A seed of envy began to grow in me.

16:27.560 --> 16:30.723
In a child's heart, many seeds are planted

16:30.720 --> 16:33.041
You never quite know what will grow

16:38.880 --> 16:41.406
Hmm. I'm sure he didn't see us.

17:35.760 --> 17:39.446
Around that time, Josemaría changed

17:40.560 --> 17:43.769
I'll tell you the story as he told it to me.

17:46.320 --> 17:49.403
One cold winter night,

17:49.400 --> 17:54.327
Josemaría saw footprints
in the snow outside his house.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.480
He followed them.

17:57.480 --> 17:59.926
And then he sew someone.

18:40.280 --> 18:43.523
And he felt that God was calling him.

19:02.160 --> 19:05.403
It wasn’t' unusual in those days...

19:05.400 --> 19:08.449
for a young man to want to become a priest

19:15.200 --> 19:19.171
Like it or not, most young men 
were celibate.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.082
At least as a priest,

19:24.080 --> 19:26.401
you got paid for it.

19:26.400 --> 19:29.563
The priesthood was a career option.

19:29.560 --> 19:34.441
But for Josemaría, it was a sacred calling.

19:57.760 --> 19:59.683
You are incorrigible.

20:03.280 --> 20:06.011
Do you know what you're taking on, son?

20:06.000 --> 20:07.126
Yes, Papa.

20:07.120 --> 20:09.646
No one to love.

20:09.640 --> 20:12.007
Human love, I mean.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.082
No family of your own.

20:15.080 --> 20:17.242
- No sons.
- I know, papi.

20:20.080 --> 20:23.926
And... is this the wisest time
to become a priest?

20:26.280 --> 20:27.930
Probably not.

20:30.120 --> 20:33.363
Is your father still selling
underpants, Josemaría?

20:33.360 --> 20:35.567
Backstabber.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.767
Hey, careerist.

20:37.760 --> 20:40.206
- Fight! Fight!
- You vain little pig!

20:41.440 --> 20:44.284
Fight! Fight!

20:46.360 --> 20:50.001
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

20:55.320 --> 20:57.687
What lesson do you draw from this?

20:58.880 --> 21:02.009
To control my temper.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.650
Bravo.

21:06.200 --> 21:09.966
Torres, what did you
call Seminarian Escrivá?

21:11.640 --> 21:14.610
A vain little... pig.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.602
And you- what did you call Torres?

21:16.600 --> 21:18.762
A backstabbing careerist.

21:18.760 --> 21:21.286
Sorry, Monsignor. I can't stand his type.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.124
A backstabbing careerist.

21:24.120 --> 21:26.521
That sums him up, eh?

21:26.520 --> 21:29.524
What, his father is rich, so he thinks
he can act like a pain in the ass?

21:29.520 --> 21:32.842
That's not the summing up
I had in mind, Escrivá.

21:33.960 --> 21:37.931
Yet, isn't someone else his Father?

21:38.440 --> 21:39.680
And yours?

21:44.880 --> 21:47.690
Remember, the withholding
of forgiveness...

21:47.680 --> 21:50.411
is the one thing, as our Lord made clear,

21:51.360 --> 21:54.409
that will not be forgiven.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.450
So...

21:59.920 --> 22:02.730
do you think that two hotheads,
a hypocrite and a loser,

22:02.720 --> 22:04.404
can be good priests?

22:07.360 --> 22:09.522
Well, I think it's possible.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.083
I really do.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.884
Well he was wrong about me.

22:25.760 --> 22:28.570
No, no, no, no! Get away!

22:28.560 --> 22:32.201
Your job is to clear this scum away...

22:32.200 --> 22:34.407
- and let my factory get back to work.
- What can we do?

22:34.400 --> 22:36.482
That's your job! Scum!

22:39.640 --> 22:42.530
-Go! 
- But they're just trying to feed 
  their families, Papa.

22:42.520 --> 22:44.522
- What?
- The workers.

22:44.520 --> 22:47.490
Scum!

22:51.120 --> 22:54.329
Manolo, when push comes to shove,

22:54.320 --> 22:56.891
a man has only one duty,

22:56.880 --> 22:59.201
and that is to choose the winning side.

22:59.200 --> 23:00.611
Eh?

23:03.480 --> 23:05.847
Come on.

23:29.520 --> 23:31.488
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:33.280 --> 23:35.328
- Good to see you.
- You too.

23:35.320 --> 23:37.800
Nice car.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.922
Where did you get all this?

23:48.920 --> 23:51.002
They're my dad's files from the '50s.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.002
There's more at the hotel.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.527
- He actually sent this stuff to you?
- Yeah.

23:56.520 --> 23:59.205
You are making progress.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.680
What's the reason for the change?

24:01.680 --> 24:04.923
I don't know.
I'm almost scared to find out.

24:11.960 --> 24:14.122
“Foundation for the Sick.”

24:14.120 --> 24:16.407
God, such a different world.

24:18.760 --> 24:22.560
Josemaría wrote to me once a year until he died.

24:22.560 --> 24:26.281
I never wrote back, but he kept writing anyway

24:26.280 --> 24:30.842
In his letters he told me the turns 
his life was taking.

24:32.040 --> 24:33.451
Honorio.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.725
Josemaría.

24:37.760 --> 24:39.888
Oh, look at you.

24:39.880 --> 24:41.405
Give me your hand.

24:42.320 --> 24:44.482
How's my old employer?

24:44.480 --> 24:46.687
Papa died four years ago, Honorio.

24:46.680 --> 24:48.489
Ah.

24:48.480 --> 24:51.006
I said my first Mass for him.

24:51.000 --> 24:56.131
Do you- you remember...

24:56.120 --> 24:58.407
the chocolate bean?

24:58.400 --> 25:00.084
Of course.

25:00.080 --> 25:02.162
It was a great lesson.

25:11.440 --> 25:13.522
I'm sorry. That won't work.

25:13.520 --> 25:15.090
Why not?

25:16.600 --> 25:18.329
Because...

25:18.320 --> 25:19.810
I'm Jewish.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.287
You know, the love of my life is Jewish.

25:32.520 --> 25:36.320
Once I thought of conversion,

25:38.200 --> 25:42.683
but I couldn't dishonor my father.

25:42.680 --> 25:48.005
Honoring our parents is the sweetest precept
of all, Honorio, and very dear to God.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.083
But Jesus Christ-
- Then he won't turn his back on me...

25:51.080 --> 25:53.287
when I stand before him, will he?

25:54.120 --> 25:56.407
What I know for sure is that...

25:56.400 --> 25:58.323
he loves you very much.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.770
Thank you.

26:07.280 --> 26:10.329
I was afraid of dying here alone.

26:17.360 --> 26:20.842
Please pray with me, Father.

26:20.840 --> 26:25.289
And you shall love the Lord your God...

26:25.280 --> 26:27.487
with all your heart...

26:27.480 --> 26:29.482
and with all your mind...

26:29.480 --> 26:31.482
and with all your soul.

26:32.520 --> 26:34.249
Our Father,

26:34.240 --> 26:36.163
who art in heaven,

26:36.160 --> 26:38.288
hallowed be thy name.

26:38.280 --> 26:41.523
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done on earth...

26:41.520 --> 26:43.522
as it is in heaven.

26:57.640 --> 26:59.642
Good night, Father.

27:14.040 --> 27:16.884
Lord, open my eyes.

27:16.880 --> 27:19.406
I am such a blind donkey.

27:22.160 --> 27:25.528
For so long I have felt you
guiding me, but to what?

27:25.520 --> 27:27.648
[Scribbling Continues]

27:27.640 --> 27:30.246
Do you have a purpose
for your donkey, Lord,

27:30.240 --> 27:32.402
but I'm too blind to see it?

27:37.840 --> 27:39.922
You were there tonight, Lord.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.922
I felt you there.

27:42.920 --> 27:44.922
Please be with me now.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.684
Please show me.

28:18.120 --> 28:20.930
Ah, now, look at this.

28:20.920 --> 28:24.208
Just a poor, ordinary little bean.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.648
Patience, skill,

28:43.640 --> 28:46.564
hard work and love...

28:46.560 --> 28:51.168
can unleash the divine flavors
hidden within.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.002
Do you understand the lesson?

29:31.920 --> 29:33.524
Yes.

29:33.520 --> 29:35.522
Yes, I see.

29:35.520 --> 29:39.081
Everyone and everything.

29:44.320 --> 29:47.961
Everyone and everything...

29:47.960 --> 29:50.361
for your glory.

29:52.960 --> 29:56.965
Your arms open to all.

29:57.920 --> 29:59.809
One by one.

30:02.880 --> 30:06.089
Thank you, Lord.

30:06.640 --> 30:09.564
So this group of red-blooded
young men are prepared...

30:09.560 --> 30:12.643
to offer themselves completely to God...

30:12.640 --> 30:17.282
in, uh, apostolic work, including celibacy?

30:17.280 --> 30:19.169
Yes, Vicar.

30:19.160 --> 30:21.766
That was the choice I gave them
and one they accepted.

30:21.760 --> 30:23.683
- Really?
- Yes.

30:28.360 --> 30:29.885
How many?

30:31.000 --> 30:32.411
Uh,

30:32.400 --> 30:33.845
three.

30:33.840 --> 30:35.251
Three.

30:41.680 --> 30:46.083
My worry is that this calling may be delusional.

30:57.680 --> 31:00.763
And this work is to include women?

31:00.760 --> 31:02.649
Yes, Your Excellency.

31:02.640 --> 31:06.122
They will live separately,
but our work will include them...

31:06.120 --> 31:09.408
and will also be open to married people.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.521
Living in the same institution?

31:13.520 --> 31:15.921
It's not an institution or a movement.

31:15.920 --> 31:18.890
It's just a family of individuals.

31:18.880 --> 31:22.009
And no, married couples will live at home.

31:23.480 --> 31:27.326
It all seems rather...

31:28.680 --> 31:30.091
Protestant-

31:31.800 --> 31:34.963
that God is to be found in the,

31:34.960 --> 31:37.201
well, vanities of daily life.

31:37.200 --> 31:38.770
Hmm?

31:38.760 --> 31:42.367
Outside holy orders.

31:43.240 --> 31:45.288
No vows. Hmm?

31:45.280 --> 31:47.931
No... habits.

31:49.480 --> 31:53.963
Well, Jesus spent most
of his life working in a shop...

31:53.960 --> 31:55.530
in Nazareth.

31:57.320 --> 31:59.891
God's world is so full of, uh-

32:15.000 --> 32:17.002
God's world is so full of goodness.

32:18.520 --> 32:22.764
If we do them for love,
each daily task can give him glory.

32:22.760 --> 32:27.084
Small but regular acts of love
between husbands and wives,

32:27.080 --> 32:29.845
between friends, between strangers,

32:29.840 --> 32:33.242
each revealing the beauty of his creation.

32:34.560 --> 32:39.646
And you want to open
a new residence in Valencia, huh?

32:39.640 --> 32:43.008
Yes. And one day in New York, Paris,

32:43.000 --> 32:46.163
London and-and... Tokyo.

32:46.160 --> 32:48.640
It's a long way to Tokyo.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.601
And, uh,

32:56.200 --> 32:58.851
no money yet to speak of.

33:02.280 --> 33:05.170
Well, I can't provide any.

33:05.160 --> 33:07.766
No, I didn't come to ask for that.

33:07.760 --> 33:12.004
I ask merely for your permission-
for me and for the work.

33:16.960 --> 33:19.008
And you shall have them.

33:19.800 --> 33:23.202
Father Escrivá,

33:23.200 --> 33:27.250
I offer you a job as my secretary.

33:27.240 --> 33:29.402
In time this will lead to a career...

33:29.400 --> 33:32.609
that might grant you the influence
that you would need...

33:32.600 --> 33:36.241
to realize this- this dream of yours.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.846
So, what do you say?

33:40.040 --> 33:41.530
I said no, thank you.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.601
Santi.

33:44.360 --> 33:46.362
Now, it won't be easy, I know.

33:46.360 --> 33:50.251
But I'll always see that there's a roof
over your heads and food on the table.

33:50.240 --> 33:52.163
No? Huh?

33:52.160 --> 33:54.447
- Josemaría-
- Actually,

33:54.440 --> 33:56.329
I have an idea.

33:56.320 --> 34:02.726
Pecunia in arboribus non crescit.

34:02.720 --> 34:05.724
Crescit. Good. Okay. Agustin.

34:05.720 --> 34:08.246
Pec- Pec-

34:08.239 --> 34:10.242
- Pecunia.
- I can't do it, sir.

34:10.239 --> 34:12.925
Yes, you can. Shh, shh. Yes, you can.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.081
You will learn, and I will learn to teach it.

34:17.600 --> 34:19.170
Oh, no. Damn it!

34:19.159 --> 34:20.650
Stay here.

34:26.199 --> 34:28.487
I'm sorry, Father.

34:28.480 --> 34:31.210
Sorry. But I can't-

34:31.199 --> 34:33.851
The smell. I can't.

34:38.800 --> 34:40.290
How's your Latin?

34:41.480 --> 34:42.925
Go.

34:42.920 --> 34:44.409
No.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.525
Go on. Go.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.841
Go, go, go. Go.

34:55.560 --> 34:58.803
Union scum.

34:58.800 --> 35:00.370
Drive through them!

35:01.200 --> 35:02.850
Don't. Thugs.

35:02.840 --> 35:05.207
How can you do this?
You know my father's ill.

35:05.200 --> 35:07.089
Then God is just.

35:15.720 --> 35:19.361
Damn unions. I've always said 
they're going to kill him.

35:19.360 --> 35:22.648
It's a stroke. The doctor just left.

35:22.640 --> 35:25.371
No. No.

35:30.280 --> 35:31.441
Papa.

35:35.720 --> 35:37.882
Papa.

35:37.880 --> 35:39.564
He can't speak.

35:39.560 --> 35:43.246
What? What did the doctor say?

35:43.240 --> 35:45.766
That it's God's will.

35:45.760 --> 35:47.330
Get out of here.

35:47.320 --> 35:49.209
Manolo, please.

35:49.200 --> 35:50.690
Get out of here.

35:51.480 --> 35:54.563
Get out!

36:07.440 --> 36:09.044
Papa.

36:11.360 --> 36:13.169
Papa?

36:17.960 --> 36:19.530
Papa.

36:44.280 --> 36:45.805
Thank you.

37:00.640 --> 37:02.608
Good afternoon, brother.

37:03.720 --> 37:04.801
Brother?

37:04.800 --> 37:06.689
Uh, Josemaría.

37:07.920 --> 37:10.571
I know who you are, Josemaría.

37:17.640 --> 37:20.689
I heard your sad news, Manolo.

37:20.680 --> 37:22.842
You have been in my prayers.

37:22.840 --> 37:27.004
Thank you. But I don't need 
your brand of sympathy-

37:27.000 --> 37:28.570
however sincere.

37:28.560 --> 37:31.370
Manolo, whatever struggles
you are experiencing-

37:31.360 --> 37:35.160
- Struggles?
- Well, whatever doubts you may be having.

37:35.160 --> 37:38.243
Doubts. Struggles.

37:38.240 --> 37:42.928
Josemaría, I blundered into the seminary
in deference to my mother.

37:42.920 --> 37:45.685
I left because I wasn't priest material.

37:46.680 --> 37:49.047
As you know.

37:49.040 --> 37:53.045
Well, maybe not, but it doesn't mean
you're not saint material.

37:57.360 --> 37:59.647
You know,

37:59.640 --> 38:04.168
my recurring nightmare is that 
I was partly to blame for you leaving.

38:04.160 --> 38:06.401
No, Josemaría.

38:06.400 --> 38:09.324
Unlike you, I chose to live 
in the real world.

38:09.320 --> 38:12.164
But I appreciate your concern.

38:12.160 --> 38:13.571
It's not concern, Manolo.

38:16.720 --> 38:18.245
It's love.

38:18.240 --> 38:21.767
Our Lord said love,
and love is what he meant.

38:21.760 --> 38:24.525
And it's what we owe each other. No?

38:26.240 --> 38:28.720
Josemaría, the truth is,

38:28.720 --> 38:31.564
we are born alone and we die alone.

38:31.560 --> 38:34.803
All we have in between
is a battle I intend to win.

38:34.800 --> 38:37.531
The rest is, frankly, sentimental drivel.

38:38.720 --> 38:41.929
Well, I will leave you.

38:43.320 --> 38:44.731
Call on me.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.765
I'll come, I promise.

38:50.880 --> 38:53.929
Josemaría. You don't give up, do you?

38:53.920 --> 38:57.049
It may help you to find some meaning
for your suffering, Manolo.

38:57.040 --> 39:00.726
Suffering has no meaning. It's meaningless.

39:00.720 --> 39:03.087
If you can show me otherwise,
I'll kiss your ass.

39:03.080 --> 39:04.605
That's my promise.

39:05.680 --> 39:08.160
I know what it is to be angry at life.

39:10.560 --> 39:12.801
Please be careful where that 
leads you, Manolo.

39:14.920 --> 39:15.762
Sheep.

39:42.280 --> 39:46.444
Around the time that Josemaría 
got a call from God,

39:46.440 --> 39:48.807
I also go! a call-

39:48.800 --> 39:52.247
from an old friend of my faiher's.

39:52.240 --> 39:54.288
Ah, Torres.

39:54.280 --> 39:57.170
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

40:05.640 --> 40:08.007
- Well?
- A spy?

40:08.000 --> 40:09.843
Yes. You.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.649
But I expected something more.

40:11.640 --> 40:15.326
With the king gone, Spain has lost 
its center of gravity.

40:15.320 --> 40:18.767
Which we will now re-create,
by force if needs be.

40:18.760 --> 40:20.649
And other means.

40:20.640 --> 40:23.086
But our government's elected. It's popular.

40:23.080 --> 40:24.411
Its time is over.

40:24.400 --> 40:26.129
The government is a rotten biscuit.

40:26.120 --> 40:29.090
- Tap it and see the maggots emerge.
- Maggots?

40:29.080 --> 40:31.242
Socialists who want a socialist state.

40:31.240 --> 40:33.242
Stalinists who want a Stalinist state.

40:33.240 --> 40:35.208
Anarchists who want no state at all.

40:35.200 --> 40:38.249
Manolo, we want to create a new Spain.

40:38.240 --> 40:41.050
A united Spain.
Cleansed with blood if necessary.

40:41.040 --> 40:43.884
Resurrected, great and as it once was-

40:43.880 --> 40:45.769
- ordered, vigorous.
- And admired.

41:00.200 --> 41:02.726
They called us fascists.

41:02.720 --> 41:05.564
We called them communists.

41:05.560 --> 41:09.610
Really, the world was much
more complicated than that.

41:09.600 --> 41:12.683
But many preferred to see it
in those simple terms.

41:12.680 --> 41:17.049
Three years later, half a millin 
people were dead-

41:17.040 --> 41:19.725
most of them civilians.

41:19.720 --> 41:22.200
But even in times like these,

41:22.200 --> 41:27.081
some people are more interested
in hats and shoes.

41:32.680 --> 41:35.365
I thought you were going to buy new shoes.

41:35.360 --> 41:40.400
Uh, yes, I was, but, uh,
something else came up.

41:40.400 --> 41:45.201
- What was that?
- No. I- I met an old lady who-

41:45.200 --> 41:47.168
- Who needed a hat.
- And some breakfast?

41:47.160 --> 41:49.447
- Yes, and some lunch.
- Thank you.

41:50.880 --> 41:53.929
Sit down, please, Pedro, Isidoro.

41:53.920 --> 41:55.524
Well, uh-

41:57.520 --> 41:59.329
So?

41:59.320 --> 42:03.086
This group that keeps you
from your homes- what is it called?

42:03.080 --> 42:05.003
We don't have a name, Mama.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.764
We just refer to it as God's work.

42:07.720 --> 42:09.449
Latin would sound better.

42:10.480 --> 42:13.609
Uh, Opus Dei.

42:32.480 --> 42:35.370
Well, your donkey may lack funds,

42:35.360 --> 42:37.362
but the work has found its name.

42:40.080 --> 42:41.525
What's next?

43:02.480 --> 43:04.005
Vamos..

43:07.880 --> 43:09.370
Está bien.

43:11.120 --> 43:15.887
A Communist strike killed my father.

43:15.880 --> 43:18.850
Now it was my turn to strike.

43:29.240 --> 43:31.402
Get out of the car!

43:31.400 --> 43:33.880
Come here, scum!

43:34.720 --> 43:37.246
- Put the hood on him!
- Please! No!

43:38.840 --> 43:41.889
Yeah, we'll show you how just God is.

43:41.880 --> 43:44.201
In the boss's car.

43:45.680 --> 43:47.569
Let's go!

44:21.600 --> 44:23.841
Where's your gun?

44:23.840 --> 44:25.842
This is not a game.

44:25.840 --> 44:28.605
He killed your father.

44:29.800 --> 44:32.246
Ah, damn it.
The bastard's shitting his pants.

44:32.240 --> 44:34.481
Do it.

44:37.160 --> 44:39.242
Do it, damn it.

45:03.040 --> 45:04.804
Pedro.

45:04.800 --> 45:07.121
- You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.

45:07.120 --> 45:09.009
You're crazy.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.809
He'll hate the whole idea.

45:10.800 --> 45:12.802
Well, let's ask him.

45:12.800 --> 45:14.290
Ask me?

45:14.280 --> 45:16.681
This. We're gonna put them up
all over Madrid.

45:16.680 --> 45:18.250
LOOK.

45:19.640 --> 45:20.971
Not me, Father. Not me.

45:20.960 --> 45:23.804
- A crusade?
- Yes, Father.

45:23.800 --> 45:27.885
Using the cross to incite hatred
and anger- that's Christian?

45:27.880 --> 45:29.530
Well, maybe not.

45:29.520 --> 45:32.330
But, Father, the government
is openly attacking the church.

45:32.320 --> 45:34.368
No, it isn't.
It's trying to modernize Spain.

45:34.360 --> 45:35.964
Come on, Pedro.

45:35.960 --> 45:37.928
If we don't do something,
we are just cowards.

45:37.920 --> 45:39.445
- Or worse- traitors.
- Traitors.

45:39.440 --> 45:41.329
- Traitors?
- Yes, Paco. Traitors.

45:41.320 --> 45:42.890
That's what people are saying.

45:42.880 --> 45:45.281
Standing by while the church gets attacked-

45:45.280 --> 45:47.408
how is that being a good Catholic?

45:47.400 --> 45:50.449
Pedro, is it understandable
to want to protect the church?

45:50.440 --> 45:51.680
Yes, Father, but-

45:51.680 --> 45:54.524
Juan, is it understandable
to want social justice?

45:54.520 --> 45:55.806
Yes, of course.

45:55.800 --> 45:58.485
Good. So the question is,
how do we achieve both?

45:58.480 --> 45:59.845
By feeding the hungry.

45:59.840 --> 46:03.003
And lunch is ready, so sit down now.

46:07.480 --> 46:09.881
So we just let the matter drop?

46:09.880 --> 46:11.530
No.

46:11.520 --> 46:14.285
Look, I'm not going
to tell you what to think.

46:14.280 --> 46:17.489
God gave each of you a brain
and reason and a conscience.

46:17.480 --> 46:20.484
Why? So that you can come
to conclusions on your own...

46:20.480 --> 46:23.006
and take personal responsibility for them.

46:23.000 --> 46:27.608
But before rushing to act-

46:27.600 --> 46:30.410
before trying to change the world-

46:30.400 --> 46:32.846
first think about changing yourselves.

46:34.520 --> 46:38.127
We're building something vital here together.

46:38.120 --> 46:40.202
Now- especially now-

46:40.200 --> 46:43.568
we have to be sowers of peace and joy.

46:46.280 --> 46:48.248
And lunch, Mama.

46:51.520 --> 46:54.364
Father!

46:54.360 --> 46:56.169
They've started killing priests.

46:56.160 --> 46:59.482
- What? 
- It's in the newspaper.

46:59.480 --> 47:00.970
Oh, my God.

47:00.960 --> 47:03.247
- Where?
- Here in Madrid.

47:03.240 --> 47:05.368
Let me see.

47:07.760 --> 47:10.366
So, what do we do now, Father?

47:10.360 --> 47:12.522
Exactly what I just said, Juan.

47:14.200 --> 47:15.770
Please.

47:18.800 --> 47:21.770
Bless us, O Lord,
and these thy gifts...

47:21.760 --> 47:23.250
which we are about to receive...

47:23.240 --> 47:26.005
from your bounty, through Christ our Lord.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.082
- Amen. 
- Amen.

48:04.600 --> 48:06.204
Oh, what have we here?

48:06.200 --> 48:07.361
Found a cockroach.

48:07.360 --> 48:08.646
Hey, watch where you're going.

48:08.640 --> 48:10.165
How about we squash it, eh?

48:10.160 --> 48:12.003
Let's squash him.

48:14.320 --> 48:16.607
Well, well, well.

48:16.600 --> 48:18.682
- Priest.
- What have we got here?

48:20.320 --> 48:21.845
- A little priest?
- Oh, yeah.

48:21.840 --> 48:23.569
- Whoa!
- Look there.

48:23.560 --> 48:25.164
- I'm sorry.
- What's he carrying?

48:25.160 --> 48:27.640
So, what have we got there? Huh?

48:27.640 --> 48:30.450
- Come on. Show us.
- No, no. Please. Please.

48:30.440 --> 48:33.887
Give me the packet,
or I stick you with this.

48:33.880 --> 48:35.484
Stab the parasite.

48:35.480 --> 48:37.801
I'm not a parasite.

48:37.800 --> 48:39.723
I have to work for a living,
just like all of you.

48:39.720 --> 48:42.121
Work for a living?
You know what working for a living is?

48:42.680 --> 48:44.284
That's enough!

48:44.280 --> 48:47.568
That's enough!

48:47.560 --> 48:50.848
Please! Get on the next one.

48:50.840 --> 48:52.729
Relax.

48:52.720 --> 48:54.245
- Relax, old man.
- Please.

48:54.240 --> 48:55.685
See you later, priest.

48:55.680 --> 48:57.728
- I'm on your side.
- Fascist.

48:57.720 --> 49:00.200
Come on.

49:00.200 --> 49:02.248
- We'll get you next time. 
- Yeah.

49:15.320 --> 49:20.167
They've got a thing
against enemies of their class.

49:20.160 --> 49:22.640
- Can't say I blame them.
- No. I know.

49:22.640 --> 49:26.042
All part of creating
this new, more civilized Spain.

49:26.040 --> 49:27.565
Exactly.

49:27.560 --> 49:30.040
And how will uncivilized behavior
accomplish that?

49:30.040 --> 49:32.441
Can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs.

49:32.440 --> 49:34.408
No. Life is not an omelet.

49:34.400 --> 49:36.289
And people are not eggs.

49:36.280 --> 49:40.490
Okay. Hey, if I was you,

49:40.480 --> 49:44.041
I'd stop wandering about
in that costume of yours.

49:44.040 --> 49:45.963
It won't protect you any more.

49:45.960 --> 49:48.406
I don't wear this for protection.

49:48.400 --> 49:51.529
You got balls for a bourgeois ass.

49:55.600 --> 49:58.126
One, two. One, two.

49:58.120 --> 50:00.361
One, two. One, two.

50:00.360 --> 50:02.886
One, two. One, two.

50:02.880 --> 50:05.611
One, two. One, two.

50:05.600 --> 50:06.806
Thank you, Father.

50:06.800 --> 50:08.404
One, two. Halt.

50:10.920 --> 50:13.082
From their palaces, the bishops said,

50:13.080 --> 50:15.845
“The meek shall inherit the earth. ”

50:17.480 --> 50:18.766
Ready!

50:19.640 --> 50:21.324
Aim! Fire!

50:22.720 --> 50:25.929
Hey!

50:28.640 --> 50:31.041
But the meek were tired of waiting.

50:34.800 --> 50:37.804
They took the bishops and their palaces.

50:38.880 --> 50:41.087
He was lucky it was only a rock.

50:47.280 --> 50:48.645
Hello?

50:51.960 --> 50:53.325
Juan? Paco?

50:58.240 --> 51:00.368
Happy birthday!

51:04.000 --> 51:05.650
It's not my birthday.

51:05.640 --> 51:08.484
Please. Come on.

51:08.480 --> 51:09.720
Josemaría,

51:09.720 --> 51:11.484
as your brother, I have been chosen...

51:11.480 --> 51:15.121
to ask you to celebrate
our second year together...

51:15.120 --> 51:16.645
by removing your shoes.

51:16.640 --> 51:18.210
Yes, Father!

51:18.200 --> 51:20.282
- Take them off.
- Take off your shoes.

51:20.280 --> 51:23.250
- Shoes off. Come on, Father.
- No.

51:23.240 --> 51:24.969
- Yes.
- Yes.

51:24.960 --> 51:27.088
- The shoes.
- Take them off.

51:31.320 --> 51:35.120
Behold a simple shoe.

51:35.120 --> 51:36.804
But is it what it seems?

51:36.800 --> 51:37.881
- Yes.
- Yes.

51:37.880 --> 51:42.807
No. It is, in fact, a hole.

51:44.240 --> 51:46.004
A hole masquerading as a shoe.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.570
Oh!

51:47.560 --> 51:50.325
And a hole surrounded by leather.

51:53.120 --> 51:54.884
Shh! Shh!

51:54.880 --> 51:59.522
But also a testament
to 20 kilometers a day,

51:59.520 --> 52:01.409
seven days a week,

52:01.400 --> 52:03.880
rain and shine.

52:05.040 --> 52:06.610
- Yes!
- Thank you.

52:06.600 --> 52:10.571
And in pity for this innocent shoe,

52:10.560 --> 52:13.723
we have also pooled together for-

52:13.720 --> 52:15.245
Ta-da!

52:15.240 --> 52:18.403
- What nice shoes.
- Try them on.

52:18.400 --> 52:21.404
Get down! Get down!

52:22.400 --> 52:23.925
Santiago, get down!

52:23.920 --> 52:25.160
- Santi!
- God!

52:28.240 --> 52:30.322
Get down!

52:33.040 --> 52:35.361
This is an announcement from your gvernment.

52:35.360 --> 52:37.647
There has been a military uprising.

52:37.640 --> 52:41.611
The army has recruited the Spanish 
colonial army of Morocco.

52:41.600 --> 52:44.410
All able-bodied Spaniards
who love their country-

52:54.880 --> 52:58.362
It's remarkably easy to join a war.

53:00.360 --> 53:03.091
I wormed my way into a communist brigade.

53:03.080 --> 53:09.122
So far, I was enjoying being a spy

53:09.120 --> 53:12.442
There is something inspiring
about the common purpose,

53:12.440 --> 53:15.091
even when It's not yours.

53:15.080 --> 53:18.721
I can't describe that ecstasy
of belonging to a crowd-

53:18.720 --> 53:21.291
even when it's the enemy.

53:21.280 --> 53:23.851
There is no better feeling.

53:23.840 --> 53:26.764
Well, apart from one.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.843
Cat got your tongue, comrade?

54:11.480 --> 54:13.926
So many young people-

54:13.920 --> 54:16.730
what do you know of suffering and death?

54:16.720 --> 54:19.326
How they will taunt you- “Is it worth it?”

54:19.320 --> 54:22.005
They will ask again and again,
“ls it worth it?”

54:23.560 --> 54:27.849
And what will fill your hearts
with the answer “Yes”? Yes!

54:29.040 --> 54:32.010
- Hatred of oppression? Of tyranny? 
- Yes!

54:32.000 --> 54:35.049
Hatred of those who treat us
like animals- 

54:35.040 --> 54:38.203
denying our hopes and stifling our lives?

54:38.200 --> 54:39.361
Yes!

54:39.360 --> 54:41.408
But more.

54:43.800 --> 54:46.610
It Will be faith-

54:46.600 --> 54:51.481
faith that a new world will be
born from the blood of the old.

54:52.880 --> 54:55.770
And comradeship, my brothers and sisters.

54:57.040 --> 54:59.202
And courage-

54:59.200 --> 55:01.328
courage to burst from our cages...

55:01.320 --> 55:03.971
and set ourselves free to live noble...

55:03.960 --> 55:06.281
as the eagle hovering
above his mountain peak.

55:07.560 --> 55:10.882
Or die in the attempt!

55:18.160 --> 55:23.087
Thanks.

55:25.240 --> 55:27.607
- Name and country.
- Régis. France.

55:27.600 --> 55:29.967
- Name and country.
- Jan. South Africa.

55:29.960 --> 55:33.442
- Name and country.
- Petofi, Ildiko. Hungary, sir.

55:33.440 --> 55:36.683
There are no “sirs”
in the Iron Brigade, Ildiko.

55:36.680 --> 55:38.808
Peasants, factory workers,

55:38.800 --> 55:40.882
some like me- escaped convicts.

55:40.880 --> 55:43.690
We are what we are,
but we are all equal.

55:43.680 --> 55:45.523
But still fighting to be free-

55:45.520 --> 55:46.931
as we all wish to be!

55:49.720 --> 55:51.290
Ildiko Petofi.

55:51.280 --> 55:52.611
Yes, sir.

55:54.200 --> 55:56.806
- Oriol.
- Yes, Oriol.

56:01.600 --> 56:02.965
“Yes, Oriol.”

56:06.600 --> 56:09.126
- Jealous?
- No.

56:09.800 --> 56:11.802
What is your name?

56:13.000 --> 56:14.331
Manolo.

56:16.800 --> 56:18.404
!Viva la Republica!

56:18.400 --> 56:20.801
!Viva!

56:28.480 --> 56:29.811
Go, go, go!

56:45.120 --> 56:46.849
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

56:47.320 --> 56:50.529
Come on!

56:54.280 --> 56:56.009
Come on!

56:57.360 --> 56:58.964
Come on!

56:59.720 --> 57:00.881
Come on!

57:13.360 --> 57:16.204
Take cover! Move!

57:23.160 --> 57:25.083
Fire! Fire! Fire!

57:39.720 --> 57:42.405
Ildi- Ildi- Ildiko!

57:44.640 --> 57:47.769
Stop. Go back. Face them.

57:47.760 --> 57:49.728
Thank the bastards for testing your bravery.

57:56.320 --> 57:57.731
Go!

57:58.520 --> 58:00.887
Go! Go. Go.

58:01.480 --> 58:03.130
- Torres.
- Yeah.

58:03.120 --> 58:04.770
Look after her.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.207
Forward!

58:15.480 --> 58:17.687
Oh, God. I'm such a coward.

58:17.680 --> 58:19.409
Me too.

58:37.320 --> 58:39.209
I don't feel right about this.

58:39.200 --> 58:40.770
You read the newspapers.

58:40.760 --> 58:43.923
They don't exactly like priests
out there, Father.

58:43.920 --> 58:46.287
Then don't call me Father
when I am dressed like this.

58:47.800 --> 58:49.802
Call me Mariano.

58:49.800 --> 58:52.326
That's Vargas.

58:52.320 --> 58:55.244
Come on, Father. I mean, Mariano.

59:00.960 --> 59:03.042
Come on. The car is here.

59:04.040 --> 59:06.520
Father, they'll be safe.
Don't worry.

59:06.520 --> 59:08.602
Father.

59:08.600 --> 59:10.125
Come on!

59:10.120 --> 59:11.804
I'll look after them. I promise.

59:11.800 --> 59:15.441
Come on! Father, come on.

59:15.440 --> 59:16.771
Hey, come on.

59:20.480 --> 59:23.563
Stop! Stop!

59:23.560 --> 59:26.040
Come this way. Get the fat pig.

59:26.040 --> 59:27.804
Father! Father!

59:29.000 --> 59:31.002
Oh! Oh! No!

59:32.800 --> 59:34.165
Come on! Come here.

59:34.160 --> 59:35.969
You stinking priest!

59:40.560 --> 59:43.166
- If you want, go ahead, pray. 
- No.

59:44.160 --> 59:45.161
No! No!

59:52.440 --> 59:54.363
Come on. Come on.

59:54.360 --> 59:56.840
Come on.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.569
Get down! Get down!

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.841
Lie down!

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:18.045
- Swine!
- Not swine, Juan.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.725
- Men- like us.
- Men?

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:24.327
Pedro, what did Father Lazaro
ever offer them but love?

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:25.890
How could they do what they did?

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.484
Because they see us
as part of a system...

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.006
which causes them pain and despair.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.480
We- We have to pray.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.931
First for-for Father Lazaro...

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.524
and then for his murderers.

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.807
But they're murderers,
and they took pleasure in it.

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.882
What do you want to do
to those swine?

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.850
Truthfully. Right now, what do you
want to do to them if you could?

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:46.729
Truthfully. And wouldn't
you take pleasure in it?

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.771
And yet we're no swine, are we?

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:07.491
But it's not the same, Father.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:10.563
No human being-
not one of us-

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:12.085
is free from human weakness.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.081
No One.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.167
Our faith is a gift,

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:20.767
and God has called us
to manifest it in love...

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.683
here on earth.

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:26.321
Unwavering love for every child
of God, no matter who it is.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.891
No matter what side,
no matter what circumstances.

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:32.089
- Even if they are wrong?
- Yes, Juan!

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.764
Even if they are wrong.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:42.170
You understand?

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:20.169
Forgive us our trespasses.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:26.329
Forgive me, Lord, for my anger.

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:29.051
For the anger of others.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.644
For hatred...

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.041
and for those who are killing.

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.168
Help me find strength.

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.164
!Viva la Repdblica!

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.208
!Viva!

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.641
Hey. Take a picture of this.

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:32.880
Of course.

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:39.249
Thank you, Captain. Let's go.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.129
He's going to put me in the book.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:45.569
Well, better to be put in a song.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.244
I read hundreds of books in jail,

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.368
and I only liked Crime and Punishment

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:52.409
I haven't read many books.

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.922
Then how do you know
what life has to offer?

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.569
I dream.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.450
So do I.

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.962
!Abajo los tiranos!

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:11.043
!Abajo los burgueses!

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.443
!Viva la Republica!

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.363
!Viva!!

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:31.010
!Viva la anarquía!

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.764
!Viva!!

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:54.643
Tonight when we camp,
I want to come to you.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.369
No, Manolo. I have told you.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.328
Why not?

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:00.687
Why put yourself through this?

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.523
You give yourself to Oriol.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.404
So I choose.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.368
And you have with others.
I know.

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:13.011
Because they might die
at any moment!

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.890
It is my choice if I wish
to give them comfort.

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:20.691
Then why refuse me?

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:22.728
Because jealousy's ugly.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.527
- Ildiko, listen.
- I saw it in your face...

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:29.569
when we first met during Oriel's speech.

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.324
You'd rather be him than you.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.045
Nyet! Nyet! Nyet!

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:33.564
Come on, you lot! Come on! Wake!

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:35.483
I've been sleeping under the sky!

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.924
Here. God bless you.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.524
Thank you, Isidoro.
This was very brave of you.

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:02.367
We'll celebrate Mass at 1:00,
and I'll hear confessions at 3:00.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:04.124
- Sorry, Father, but- 
- Don't worry.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.929
I know the perfect place.

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.604
...ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis,

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:14.251
in nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritus Sancti.

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.891
Thank you, Father.

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:34.245
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:37.130
My last confession was five months ago.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.327
And I promise that-

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.802
Father.

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.125
Papers.

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.568
Enjoying the zoo, are we?

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:11.451
Yes. It's very educational.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:15.684
And where is the wife
when you're being educated?

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:18.843
Back home doing the laundry?

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.009
My mother's idea.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.321
It's not the first time
it's kept me safe.

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:39.005
Father, do you need shelter?

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.487
Yes. Do you know somewhere?

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:46.603
Well, I only have a single room,

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:49.729
and there's almost no room for me, but if-

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.404
You are beautiful.

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:56.611
I am a priest, but- but also a man.

01:08:59.279 --> 01:09:02.045
So I thank you for your courage,

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.724
but no.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:40.410
Oriol, what is it?

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:50.571
If something happens to me,

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.089
I'll wait for you on the other side.

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:59.085
- Don't say that. 
- We are at war, Ildiko. I don't know.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.967
We've held the fascists back
for two years.

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:07.325
But the Germans give them planes,

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:10.767
and our leaders in Madrid
fight amongst themselves...

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.285
and give us nothing.

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:16.842
So let's dream now... while we can.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.049
We need a stretcher!

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:23.522
Here they come again!

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:28.766
Help! Help!

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:32.970
Ammunition!

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.083
The bastards know exactly
where to find us.

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:41.050
Squeeze! Squeeze!

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:43.605
Let me take care of that.

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:45.602
No, leave it. Come on. Let's go.

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.762
Let's go, let's go!

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:57.362
This stinks.

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:00.091
We're sitting ducks.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:02.606
Those damn communists in Madrid
are hanging us out to dry.

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:06.406
We're being sacrificed.

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.765
I can do something about that.

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:18.606
What's that then?

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.409
A safe-conduct.

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.289
It's a pass.

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:26.604
It allows anyone safe passage
to the enemy side.

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:46.611
Let's go!

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:50.406
- Open the gate! 
- Coming! I'm coming!

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.563
The militia! The militia are here!

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.927
- Come with me! Come with me!
- Quickly! This way!

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.444
Jorge, get out.

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:08.805
What the hell is going on?

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.290
We need to hide the priest.

01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:11.406
Priest?

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.402
The militia are here.
They'll kill him.

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.528
- Good riddance.
- Slob.

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:17.443
Come on. Go.
Please go. Quickly. Go.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:18.566
Priest.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.245
What if I turn you in?

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:24.528
Then I'll meet my Maker
far sooner than anticipated.

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:26.727
If they find you here, so will I.

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.643
Yes, you're right.
Isidoro, stay here and hide.

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.324
- No, Father. Please.
- I will give myself up.

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:31.890
- I will give myself up.
- No.

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.169
- Get your papers!
- Now! They're coming!

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:37.527
Begone! Go!

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:51.170
Your papers.

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.008
In my jacket.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.401
Then get them.

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.049
Ana.

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.730
Look in there.

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:25.250
Miguel.

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:44.850
Where's the key?

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:56.926
Where's the key, sir?

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:15.928
Captain, sir. Forgive me, sir.

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:21.284
Don't worry. Just doing your duty.

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:38.931
They've gone.

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:40.843
You better stay here until it gets dark.

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.729
Then get the hell out of Madrid...

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:44.484
unless you've got a death wish.

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:46.448
Thank you.

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.249
Thank you?

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:50.163
They should put me in a madhouse.

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:05.251
I have a straitjacket if you 
think he'll be dangerous.

01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:07.288
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:22.170
Oh, no. There's militia there.
There's a roadblock.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:23.400
Please, sir, turn left.

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:38.322
God is a primitive concept we
grew out of during the Enlightenment!

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.731
Shh! Shh, Shh!

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:52.211
Who'll dare fight me?

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:55.522
Huh? Who?
Who will dare fight me?

01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:57.727
Who?

01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:59.688
Who will dare fight me?

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:21.569
You bastards! You enjoy this!

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:32.724
Someone is betraying us,
and, I swear,

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:35.724
when I find out who it is-
no mercy.

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:49.929
We have to do it tonight.

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:05.962
He doesn't hear you, does he?

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:14.487
All this pain,
and God just stays silent.

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.762
He is a monster, you know?

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.130
I love him.

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.444
Although he's a monster?

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:45.082
Women can love monsters.

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:55.448
This is the address! Dismount!

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:05.169
Isidoro, we need to change plans.

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:09.249
We're here to Search the building.

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:13.768
After I was raped, I stopped going to Mass.

01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:17.685
I couldn't understand
how God allowed such a thing.

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:24.526
I accepted, you see, God can be terrible.

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:27.604
So now I do go to Mass,

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:32.049
and my prayers are deeper than before.

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:35.489
I fight him with love, you see.

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:42.371
I like you.

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:48.369
You look me in the eye.

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:52.126
- You don't pity me.
- No.

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:55.882
No, you are extremely brave.

01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:57.882
Not really.

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.803
I still sleep with the lights on...

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:05.848
and a chair wedged under the door handle.

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:13.968
I think you have mountains to climb.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.128
And I think it will be painful.

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:23.081
But that will make it seem sweet
when you are finished.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:29.170
Father. Father.

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:30.924
We have to leave.

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:33.082
Where to this time?

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:36.289
Uh, over the Pyrenees.

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:37.725
- Come back here!
- No.

01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:39.131
- We'll be safe there.
- No!

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:41.600
I'm going back into the city.

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:44.251
I promised God his flock here
would never be deserted.

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:46.561
- I'm not going to Andorra.
- No.

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:49.040
No, it's suicide to stay,
and you know it.

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.804
And if you die, they will be deserted.

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.882
And Carmen and your mother
and Santiago-

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:54.291
Father.

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:56.169
- No.
- We have to leave.

01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:58.965
Yes, please.

01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.244
Over the mountains?

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.081
Yeah.

01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:13.288
Father?

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.004
Commandant, it's field three, sir.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.048
He says this is his last transmission.

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:41.160
Sir, we've lost our mole.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.289
Slaying your demons is never easy.

01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:08.604
Sometimes It's better to get someone else 
to slay them for you.

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:23.366
Get up! Get her up!

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:30.241
Look at this! Look at this!

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:33.049
What is this?

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:34.690
It's a radio!

01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:37.889
Come on! Come on!
You filthy traitor!

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:41.004
They found the traitor!

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:45.966
Are you sure? Who saw them? Who?

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:47.883
Everyone! Them!

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:50.042
Stop! Hey!

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:53.204
Let's take a vote!

01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:57.007
Who wants to kill her?

01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:03.404
What more?

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.245
I will do it.

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:08.571
What?

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:12.965
I Will do it.

01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:51.961
How could you have done this?

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:54.088
I didn't, Oriol.

01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.605
Five men say they saw you.

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:58.126
- And they're lying.
- But you were found with the radio.

01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:01.090
It was planted.
For God's sake, isn't it obvious?

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.121
No.

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.450
You're Hungarian.

01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:09.125
And there are Hungarians
fighting with the fascists too.

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:14.608
They were going to kill you themselves.

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:22.810
But I said I would do it.

01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:35.847
When I was 18...

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:37.808
I killed a political boss.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.321
And I was proud of it.

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:46.208
But now-

01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:48.851
what I have to do ma-
makes me feel sick.

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:53.241
I loved you, Ildiko.

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:55.163
But your kisses came from the lips of Judas.

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:58.164
No! No! No, please!

01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:00.970
How many have died because of you?

01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:03.361
- How many?
- Please!

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.681
Because I trusted you.

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:14.045
Ildiko.

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:28.610
Hello?

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:30.284
Yeah.

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:34.251
Ah.

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:38.446
Thanks.

01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:43.322
It's Dad.

01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:45.448
He's been taken to hospital.

01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:19.284
What do we do now?

01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:21.089
- Get the men away from here. 
- How?

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:24.323
Tell them he was a traitor.
He was guilty. He shot himself.

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.731
They won't believe it.

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.370
- They will!
- No-

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:29.124
They saw it themselves.

01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:31.327
They trust you. Go!

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:32.924
Go!

01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:39.122
Come on!

01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:48.164
Come on! Get those trucks moving!

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:51.482
Get loaded up!
Don't leave anything behind! Come on!

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:14.121
Who would have thought...

01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:16.122
that someone like you-

01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:22.202
someone like you could have
destroyed someone like him?

01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:25.647
Someone like you.

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:32.928
This is yours!

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:39.491
Where are you going?

01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.364
You should go back to Madrid.

01:27:58.400 --> 01:27:59.731
I can arrange it.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.490
For the baby's sake!

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:37.971
Hey! Where are you going! Hey!

01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:41.282
Let her go. I found this on his body.

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:44.648
It's a safe-conduct.
A pass... from the enemy.

01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:54.969
He's right.

01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:57.486
Let her go. Let her go!

01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:59.164
- Let her go.
- Give her the gun.

01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:17.287
Manolo, what about us?

01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:19.442
What about us?

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:22.125
You have your passes.
Use them.

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:31.282
He's dying, Robbie.

01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:35.080
You have to get over this thing
between you- for both our sakes.

01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:38.448
For our sakes? He's the one
who broke off Contact with me.

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:40.044
- He's the one who said he never wanted- 
- Robbie-

01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:42.168
Robbie, why do you think I came?

01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:45.323
Because you're... stubborn.

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:49.450
Because I needed you.

01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:52.808
Yes, and because I sensed
this was going to happen.

01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:54.723
That your dad was going to-

01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:56.324
That this was a crisis.

01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:57.526
No.

01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:59.648
I don't love my father.

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:01.324
I hate him.

01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:04.608
He's a cold, distant,

01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:06.170
moralistic prick.

01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:07.810
Oh, I see, Robbie.

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:09.484
You hate your father.

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:15.486
That's why you don't want to be one.

01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:17.281
Isn't it?

01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:20.605
Isn't it?

01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:40.321
All this pain, and God just stays silent.

01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:43.803
Do you hate God now?

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:50.046
I couldn’t understand how God 
allowed such a thing.

01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:52.008
Please be with me now.

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:56.484
Please show me.

01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:01.724
He doesn't hear you, does he?

01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:09.202
Look. Pallerols.

01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:12.685
Here, Father.

01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:24.964
You must eat, Father.

01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:27.281
- You need to build up your strength.
- I should never have left.

01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:31.361
I have deserted people who rely on me.

01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:34.563
We all agreed to get you to safety, Father,

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:37.404
even if we have to carry you
every step of the way.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.401
No, no, no, no, no.

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:06.848
I'm not worthy, am I?

01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:11.485
That's why you stay silent.

01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:16.006
Unlike you, I chose
to live in the real world.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.368
Mama? Do you hate God now?

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.169
No, dearest.

01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:24.289
I... love him very much.

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:34.766
I fight him with love, you see.

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:03.365
- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning.

01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:08.601
What?

01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:12.562
Haven't we further to climb?

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:15.251
Let's go, boys. Let's go.

01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:26.969
How is your book, huh?

01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:29.644
It's coming along.

01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:33.762
Thank you for the tapes.

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:35.364
Mm.

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.806
They won't tell you everything.

01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:40.371
I didn't think they would.

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:02.848
I once had the chance to kill him.

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:08.125
Josemaría.

01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:14.569
I didn't know whose side I was on any more.

01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:21.525
They sent me to the Pyrenees.

01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:24.329
Border patrol.

01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:27.686
He was trying to cross.

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:30.331
Refugees were fair game.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.207
They are celebrating Mass.

01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:38.121
Perfect shot.

01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:42.244
No. Not now.

01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:45.005
- What side are you on?
- I said not now.

01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:51.045
We pray that the path to goodness
may yet be found...

01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:54.089
amongst all this suffering
and confusion and violence.

01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:56.282
Jesus.

01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:59.164
We also pray that the freedom...

01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:02.926
with which we have chosen hatred may
now be used to choose forgiveness,

01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:06.925
that love can pierce all hearts...

01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:09.366
one-on-one so that all may attain peace.

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:10.407
Dad?

01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:14.850
Dad?

01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:32.731
Read it.

01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:37.482
See what was done.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.287
I have food. Take it.

01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:18.368
Why are you wasting your life?

01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:20.328
He's dead.

01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:25.411
He is waiting for me
on the other side.

01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:30.086
When a bullet ends this
for me, he'll be there.

01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:37.282
That is what he told me.

01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:43.925
I believe him.

01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:14.443
Roberto, have you read Cervantes?

01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:20.727
He said that our greatest enemies are within.

01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:33.003
Yes. One more, my darling.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.924
It is out. Let's cut it.

01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:39.322
There, there. Shush, shush. Shh.

01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:47.164
Ah.

01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:50.642
Here he is, a wonderful child.

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:52.244
He's beautiful.

01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:54.481
Wonderful little boy child.

01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:56.767
Shush, shush, shush.

01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:59.161
She wouldn't touch you.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:02.130
Because of him she just wanted to die.

01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:05.363
She knew that wouldn't happen...

01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:06.885
if she held you.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.480
So she left you there...

01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:13.006
and never came back.

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:21.761
Surrender! You must surrender?

01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:25.446
Give up. Give up!

01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:28.683
Lay down your weapons and come out.

01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:32.526
You're fighting for a lost cause.

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:36.605
This is your last chance to save your lives.

01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:38.728
I give you 30 seconds...

01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:42.486
to lay down your weapons
with your hands up...

01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:44.482
above your heads.

01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:46.847
Otherwise, you will die.

01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:51.686
I repeat: This is your last oppotunity.

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:54.650
- Gun. Little dog, give me a pistol.
- Give up.

01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:58.370
Come on.

01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:28.127
It was the only time...

01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:31.169
I could give her what she wanted

01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:56.808
So now you know it all.

01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:05.840
So I went back for you.

01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:11.325
After the war.

01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:14.283
To that farm.

01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:16.169
Why?

01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:23.166
What life for a little child
would there be there?

01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:26.409
In that time,

01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:29.688
I don't think you would
be writing your books.

01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:34.010
I thought with her death,

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.810
I would be free of her,

01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:38.404
of that pain.

01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:42.329
But it didn't work,

01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:45.450
because...

01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:47.522
when I looked into your eyes,

01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:52.363
I saw.. hers.

01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:03.407
What do you expect me to do?

01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:07.728
I mean,

01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:12.123
just what do you expect me...

01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:13.963
to do?

01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:18.406
Pray for me.

01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:23.211
And one day forgive me, my son.

01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:24.690
I'm-

01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:29.605
I'm not your son.

01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:54.605
Oh, Robbie.

01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:56.090
Your mother.

01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:07.282
He asked me to pray for him.

01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:10.209
Can you believe that?

01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:13.122
Will you?

01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:14.610
No way.

01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:17.644
Not for him.

01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:25.610
He's dying, Rob.

01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:34.404
All that time I believed
that she died in some plane crash.

01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:37.926
My whole childhood...

01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:41.163
praying for one sign of affection.

01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:45.085
But he's freed you
from that now, hasn't he?

01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:49.005
All of this dredged up
because of some damn book.

01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:52.242
Not some damn book.

01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:54.561
A chance.

01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:56.369
What?

01:46:56.360 --> 01:47:00.649
A chance to mend something that's broken.

01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:04.161
You're not here by coincidence, Rob.

01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:06.644
Don't you see?

01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:10.731
That's not very scientific, Lil, is it?

01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:12.131
Oh, Robbie.

01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:15.249
There are different ways
of measuring the same universe.

01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:19.211
And in yours, chance isn't blind, is it?

01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:25.770
No. It isn't.

01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:39.289
Josemaría?

01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:44.129
My friend.

01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:50.167
You came...

01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:51.969
as promised.

01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:04.963
Pray for me,

01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:07.122
Josemaría.

01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:09.009
Is someone with him?

01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:36.326
You gave me a... rosary.

01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:40.164
I still have it.

01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:47.528
I've never used it,

01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:52.844
but I have it.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.889
Can I be forgiven?

01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:32.766
Dad?

01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:41.041
Dad.

01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:51.087
Robert.

01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:53.890
So many wrong turns in my life.

01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:07.530
It's- It's over now, Dad.

01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:10.449
Except for...

01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:15.607
kissing his ass, hmm?

01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:18.080
What?

01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:23.609
His.

01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:55.569
When you forgive, you set someone free.

01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:57.688
Yourself

01:51:57.680 --> 01:52:01.480
I think my father wanted me
to forgive him for my sake.

01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:03.482
And I'm trying.

01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:21.081
A life, Dona Dolores,

01:52:21.080 --> 01:52:23.321
can't be fathomed on its own.

01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:25.482
It's like-

01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:28.051
It's like a thread
in that embroidery of yours-

01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:30.486
twisted around other threads,

01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:33.370
wound together in place and time.

01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:35.362
Difficult to see the pattern...

01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:37.681
until it's all finished.

01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:39.330
If it ever is finished.

01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:45.851
Whoa!

01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:47.171
You okay?

01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:54.484
Look, Father. Andorra.

01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:56.642
- Once there, we are safe.
- Thank God.

01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:09.849
Waiting for your order.

01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:13.161
Sir? Now?

01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:18.361
Then I'll do it without an order.

01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:22.846
- Down!
- Sniper!

01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:24.205
Get down!

01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:25.884
- Father!
- Has he been shot?

01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:27.882
Father, are you hit?

01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:30.087
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on, Father!

01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:31.684
- Let's go!
- Run!

01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:33.648
- To the border!
- Quick! Quickly!

01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:36.246
Come on!
We're nearly there!

01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:42.610
Come on, come on!

01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:51.208
Freedom!

01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:53.965
We made it!

01:53:57.320 --> 01:53:58.765
Thank you.

01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:00.410
Father?
