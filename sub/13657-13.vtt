He was married
to my sister's best friend

From high school.

09:54.027 --> 09:56.761
He's still just a deputy?
I thought he was a climber.

Deputy diaz may have waited
eight years for payback.

if my daughter had been raped.

And committed suicide.

Around the rileys' house

that eric was on parole?

10:30.263 --> 10:32.964
See if we can put
deputy diaz in the area.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.933
The, uh, sheriff's office
won't like it

10:34.935 --> 10:37.335
If we pull down one of their
deputies as a suspect.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.004
Right.

Well, let's tell deputy diaz
that eric riley went missing

And we could use his help

Well, that's great,

Because I don't really deal
with a lot of crazy people.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.909
And, also,
this isn't therapy.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.144
It's an evaluation,

11:29.289 --> 11:31.056
To spend two afternoons
with you.

11:31.058 --> 11:34.259
Evaluations are less
about addressing your issues

11:34.261 --> 11:36.928
And more about gauging
how you'll react to stress.

11:41.267 --> 11:46.905
Oh, plus, you have to fill out
all these questionnaires.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.940

Are they just like
personality tests?

12:19.172 --> 12:20.772
Uh, yeah.

12:20.774 --> 12:23.174
They're exactly like

12:23.176 --> 12:26.411
The city needs them
to avoid liability issues.

If you're just going to do

30:30.963 --> 30:33.831
I charged people
for what I...Did.

30:33.833 --> 30:35.566
I solicited.

30:36.868 --> 30:38.302
I chose to do that.

30:38.304 --> 30:42.406
And did you also choose
to be left behind in l.A.

30:42.408 --> 30:45.075
When your mother drove off
with her boyfriend?

30:45.077 --> 30:46.977
Did you choose
to live on the streets

30:46.979 --> 30:48.212
When you were 15 years old?

30:48.214 --> 30:50.948
And if you didn't choose
those things,

30:50.950 --> 30:52.349
Would you describe

30:52.351 --> 30:55.786
Taking care of yourself
under those conditions as --

30:55.788 --> 30:57.287
As something you deserved?

30:59.958 --> 31:02.492

you guys can understand

31:02.494 --> 31:05.195
Just how angry I've been
about all this.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.898
Okay, yes,
I wanted to kill the guy

31:07.900 --> 31:09.867

to my daughter,

31:09.869 --> 31:12.803
But somebody beat me to it.

31:12.805 --> 31:14.071
And who do you think
that is?

31:14.073 --> 31:16.106
I don't know, captain.

31:16.108 --> 31:18.508
Could you please extend me
a little professional courtesy?

31:18.510 --> 31:21.545
Because if I would have actually
murdered that little creep,

31:21.547 --> 31:24.581
I promise you,
you would have never known.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.250
Flynn: That's a lot more

this girl heather

was up to,

Conspiracy to commit murder
is out.

31:38.130 --> 31:40.898
I could maybe arraign him
for attempt.

31:40.900 --> 31:43.834
That's a distant
fallback position, andrea.

31:43.836 --> 31:46.470
Someone needs to be charged
with homicide.

31:46.472 --> 31:48.138

You can't talk your way
out of this.

31:51.210 --> 31:54.444
Coconspirator?
Heather told us everything.

31:54.446 --> 31:56.079
Well, that must have
been quick,

31:56.081 --> 31:57.881
'cause heather
doesn't know anything.

31:57.883 --> 31:59.449
Is that how she ended up

31:59.451 --> 32:01.451
Face-to-face
with her sister's rapist?

32:01.453 --> 32:02.552

32:06.424 --> 32:08.191
I would have never
allowed heather

of eric riley.

We have a witness who saw her
in eric riley's bedroom.

32:12.131 --> 32:14.197
Yeah? Well, your witness
is lying, okay?

32:14.199 --> 32:17.034
Heather didn't even have
that asshole's address.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.635
I made sure of that.

32:18.637 --> 32:21.104
Then who's the other girl
you had inside the riley house?

32:21.106 --> 32:23.540
There was no other girl!
<i>Don't you get it?!</i>

We will not answer
any more of your questions.

to smear my son's memory.

No. No, ma'am.

32:44.096 --> 32:46.396
We asked
you and your family downtown

in eric's murder.

And if you help us,

32:51.370 --> 32:54.471
We can probably make our arrest
in a few minutes.

32:54.473 --> 32:57.541
If we're helping you,
then why did you just
read us our rights

as eric?

about homicide,

Especially when we're this close
to making an arrest.

33:05.584 --> 33:09.486

who killed my son?

33:09.488 --> 33:10.687
We do.

Sykes:
I'll show you six photos,

33:13.092 --> 33:14.624
One of which should be a picture

33:14.626 --> 33:16.927
Of the girl eric was talking to
in your house last week.

33:16.929 --> 33:18.328

33:19.964 --> 33:21.965
You didn't see her?
No.

And you, miss riley --
did you see her?

33:24.570 --> 33:26.303
Eric wasn't allowed visitors.

33:26.305 --> 33:29.172
Yeah, I didn't want
to worry you, nicole.

33:29.174 --> 33:30.941
There was --
I came home early,

33:30.943 --> 33:32.342
And there was a young lady
in eric's room,

33:32.344 --> 33:33.410
And I asked her
to leave.

33:48.727 --> 33:51.561
She didn't.

33:51.563 --> 33:55.298
Actually, mrs. Riley,
she was never in your home,

33:55.300 --> 33:58.168
And she never met eric.

33:58.170 --> 34:00.037
And your husband just lied.

34:00.039 --> 34:02.639
Isn't that right,
dr. Riley?

34:02.641 --> 34:06.510
Now I'm going to explain
what's about to happen here.

34:06.512 --> 34:09.413
There are how many routes,
lieutenant tao?

34:13.152 --> 34:15.452
And the bridge
where we found your son.

34:15.454 --> 34:19.656
We're out pulling video from
cameras along all these routes.

34:19.658 --> 34:21.525
Sometime during that journey,

34:21.527 --> 34:24.494
We'll find film of the driver
of that car

34:24.496 --> 34:26.329
Who took eric
to that bridge.

34:26.331 --> 34:30.000
And if that driver is you,
the sooner you tell us,

we can make it for you.

41:12.938 --> 41:14.838
Oh, yeah.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.773
You said it's on,
so it's on.

41:16.775 --> 41:18.408
Unless you object
to being timed.

41:18.410 --> 41:20.176
Oh [laughs] no, no.

41:20.178 --> 41:22.011
I'm ready.

41:23.080 --> 41:25.582
[ clock ticking ]
