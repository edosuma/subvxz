In the criminal justice system,

00:08.509 --> 00:09.810
sexually-based offenses

00:09.843 --> 00:12.146
are considered
especially heinous.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.815
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.848 --> 00:16.584
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.617 --> 00:18.086
are members
of an elite squad

00:18.119 --> 00:19.720
known as
the special victims unit.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.555
These are their stories.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.593
Best estimate, she's about
30 weeks along.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.228
Came in alone,
slight bleeding

00:27.261 --> 00:28.696
with contractions
at 20-minute intervals.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.264
She say
who the father is?

00:30.298 --> 00:32.733
No, this isn't the first time
she's been pregnant.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.668
Scarring suggests
she's delivered before.

00:34.702 --> 00:35.503
You find her parents?

00:35.536 --> 00:37.338
Refuses to tell us
where they are.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.672
Only says her first name
is Melanie,

00:38.706 --> 00:40.108
and she's 12 1/2
years old.

00:42.176 --> 00:44.112
A.C.S. will arrange
for foster care

00:44.145 --> 00:45.613
after you release her.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.415
She's not going anywhere
until after the baby's born.

00:47.448 --> 00:50.084
Next ten weeks,
this is home.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.423
Hey.

00:55.456 --> 00:56.590
Melanie!

00:56.624 --> 00:58.859
I'm Olivia.
I'm a police officer.

00:58.892 --> 01:02.596
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

01:02.630 --> 01:05.766
The doctor said that you
had another baby before.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.067
Is that right?

01:09.603 --> 01:11.372
He died.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.741
My mom said
he's with God now.

01:15.876 --> 01:17.878
Well, it's good that you
came to a hospital.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.413
Was that your idea?

01:23.517 --> 01:25.085
Was it your mom's?

01:27.755 --> 01:30.724
Well, I'm glad your mom
thought of that.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.760
She must love you
very much.

01:35.663 --> 01:38.566
If you tell me where you live,
I can go get her.

01:40.734 --> 01:43.604
I'm not supposed to tell.

01:46.374 --> 01:47.841
Melanie...

01:47.875 --> 01:48.909
if you were my daughter,

01:48.942 --> 01:51.479
I'd wanna be
right here with you.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.719
Will you write down
your address for me?

02:05.859 --> 02:06.827
You know, if you want,

02:06.860 --> 02:09.797
I can also try
to find the father of your baby.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.700
Can you tell me
his name?

02:12.733 --> 02:14.702
Abraham.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.306
And who's Abraham?

02:20.841 --> 02:22.710
He's my husband.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.646
Well, the guy
should be home.

02:25.679 --> 02:28.382
She said that
he doesn't work.

02:28.416 --> 02:29.950
Okay, they're here.
I'll see you in ten.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.185
Bye.

02:31.219 --> 02:32.620
Somebody's watching.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.788
My partner's on his way.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.590
Keep your eye out.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.708
Hello.

02:54.742 --> 02:55.876
Hey, I'm a police officer.

02:55.909 --> 02:58.412
Is your mom or dad home?

02:58.446 --> 03:00.348
Are all you guys here
by yourself?

03:01.815 --> 03:05.519
Hey, kids.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.888
It's okay, Samuel.
Go in there and play.

03:09.457 --> 03:12.393
Can I help you?

03:12.426 --> 03:13.961
Detective Benson,
Special Victims Unit.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.296
Are you Abraham?

03:15.329 --> 03:17.531
Why?

03:17.565 --> 03:19.900
Sir, I'd like to ask you
to step outside, please.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.769
No, I'm sorry, I can't.

03:21.802 --> 03:22.970
Things'll be
a lot easier for you

03:23.003 --> 03:24.672
if you step outside.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.241
Son of a bitch.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.310
S.V.U., portable to central.

03:29.343 --> 03:33.514
I need a couple of units
at 104 West 120th Street.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.783
The suspect is inside.
I need to secure all exits.

03:35.816 --> 03:36.817
How many kids
in there?

03:36.850 --> 03:37.785
At least four.
Go around the back--

03:37.818 --> 03:42.890
[gunshots]

03:43.991 --> 03:45.793
1013! 1013!

03:45.826 --> 03:48.329
Shots fired!
Shots fired at police!

03:48.362 --> 03:49.897
Are you okay?

03:49.930 --> 03:51.699
(radio)
Shots fired at 104--

04:40.681 --> 04:42.550
The property records say that
the building is owned

04:42.583 --> 04:43.651
by an Abraham Ophion.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.553
Hostage negotiators
tried talking with bullhorns.

04:45.586 --> 04:46.387
No response.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.688
Anyone try
an old-fashioned phone call?

04:47.721 --> 04:49.022
No phone service,
and ConEd

04:49.056 --> 04:50.157
cut off the electricity
eight years ago.

04:50.190 --> 04:52.593
Neighbors said they've seen
up to three dozen people

04:52.626 --> 04:53.561
in the house at a time.

04:53.594 --> 04:54.762
Mostly women and kids.

04:54.795 --> 04:55.763
Neighbors
have any problems?

04:55.796 --> 04:57.565
They all got
the same story.

04:57.598 --> 04:58.532
They're weirdos,
but they're quiet.

04:58.566 --> 05:00.568
They got one noise citation
ten years ago

05:00.601 --> 05:02.570
for doing construction
in the middle of the night.

05:02.603 --> 05:03.471
That's it.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.048
We think the hostages
are in the living room here.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.484
Any idea how many kids.

05:16.517 --> 05:17.451
I saw at least four.

05:17.485 --> 05:18.719
We got a fix
on the perp?

05:18.752 --> 05:20.521
No, but we got
all the exits covered.

05:20.554 --> 05:21.555
He's not getting out.

05:21.589 --> 05:22.856
[gunshot]

05:22.890 --> 05:25.058
[gunshot]

05:25.092 --> 05:27.861
[gunshot]
Multiple shots
fired inside!

05:27.895 --> 05:29.863
Entry team, go!
Entry team, go!

05:31.565 --> 05:33.534
[gunshots]

05:44.545 --> 05:47.515
(officer on radio)
Call E.M.S.!
Get E.M.S. here now!

05:49.049 --> 05:51.385
Come here!
Come here, somebody!

05:51.419 --> 05:52.653
ZermeÃ±o, where's the perp?!

05:52.686 --> 05:53.854
He's gone!

05:53.887 --> 05:55.389
What happened?

05:55.423 --> 05:56.424
They're dead.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.559
They're all dead.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.896
C.S.U. found an old tunnel
under the house

07:42.930 --> 07:45.866
leading to a vacant building
on the next block.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.901
So far, that's where
the trail ends.

07:47.935 --> 07:51.138
Abraham Ophion has no known
criminal record,

07:51.171 --> 07:53.541
though it is likely
a fake name.

07:53.574 --> 07:54.942
We do know eight years ago

07:54.975 --> 07:57.110
he tried to obtain
tax-exempt status

07:57.144 --> 07:59.980
for his group,
the Church of Wisdom and Sight.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.248
That, along with
the way they lived,

08:01.281 --> 08:02.916
and the events
surrounding their deaths

08:02.950 --> 08:05.152
indicate we may be
dealing with a cult.

08:05.185 --> 08:08.155
Other members may have
escaped through the tunnel.

08:08.188 --> 08:10.290
Our priority now
is to find them

08:10.323 --> 08:12.660
and to identify
the victims.

08:12.693 --> 08:15.095
In addition, I want
to make sure

08:15.128 --> 08:17.164
you're all taking care of
yourselves.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.667
The department is providing
psych support,

08:19.700 --> 08:21.902
and you're all to sit down
and talk to one of these people,

08:21.935 --> 08:23.537
sooner rather than later.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.138
It is not optional.

08:25.172 --> 08:29.009
None of you are exempt
from what I just said.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.678
Captain?

08:30.711 --> 08:32.780
We can always
get our head shrunk

08:32.813 --> 08:34.782
after this case is over.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.984
Get it done,
or you're off the case.

08:38.185 --> 08:41.655
I can sit down
with each of you right now.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.523
Fine, let's
get it over with.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.127
What do you
most remember seeing

08:47.160 --> 08:48.662
after you entered
the house?

08:48.696 --> 08:50.798
Dead bodies.

08:50.831 --> 08:53.233
Anything specific
about them?

08:53.266 --> 08:56.136
A bunch of dead bodies.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.171
Seen plenty.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.974
So this was no different
than any other case.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.976
What do you want me to say?
That it was terrible?

09:03.010 --> 09:04.044
Fine...it was terrible.

09:04.077 --> 09:07.781
But one way or another...

09:07.815 --> 09:09.316
they all are.

09:09.349 --> 09:12.119
Then you think this
is a big waste of your time.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.921
Hell, no, I think we should
sit around all day

09:13.954 --> 09:15.222
and chat about our feelings.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.924
Well, what do you want
to talk about?

09:16.957 --> 09:18.225
Well, it doesn't really matter.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.761
We could all talk till
we're blue in the face.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.696
It's not gonna change the fact
that the human race

09:22.730 --> 09:24.264
is ever-evolving
and will always come up

09:24.297 --> 09:26.233
with elaborate,
repulsive,

09:26.266 --> 09:28.669
and depraved ways
to kill each other.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.805
And that's really the hard part
for you, isn't it?

09:31.839 --> 09:32.873
What?

09:32.906 --> 09:35.142
That you can still
be repulsed.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.210
As cynical as you
try to be,

09:37.244 --> 09:42.182
you can still
be sickened.

09:44.051 --> 09:46.086
How are you feeling now?

09:46.119 --> 09:49.089
I don't know.

09:49.122 --> 09:52.159
This was an extremely
traumatic event, Liv.

09:52.192 --> 09:55.295
The grief that you're feeling
is completely natural.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.100
I know that.

10:00.133 --> 10:03.103
But you feel like you shouldn't
be feeling anything?

10:03.136 --> 10:04.972
Is that how you feel?

10:07.274 --> 10:09.076
[sighs]

10:09.109 --> 10:12.245
Tell me what you did
last night after you went home.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.114
I ate dinner,
called my kid.

10:14.147 --> 10:16.216
Your son, right?

10:16.249 --> 10:18.251
Do you talk to him often?

10:18.285 --> 10:19.920
Not as much as I should.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.255
I just wanted to call
and say hey.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.793
Did you tell him
about the case?

10:25.826 --> 10:28.228
Nobody needs that
in their head.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.997
You got it
in your head.

10:31.899 --> 10:35.435
What does that
mean to you?

10:35.468 --> 10:37.337
It means nobody's safe.

10:38.806 --> 10:41.909
And that
makes you feel...

10:41.942 --> 10:43.143
helpless?

10:45.946 --> 10:48.281
Not at all.
Look...

10:48.315 --> 10:51.218
I got my own kids,
and eventually you realize

10:51.251 --> 10:53.186
that you can't always
protect them.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.322
What made you think about
your own children?

10:57.958 --> 11:00.160
Why do you think?

11:00.193 --> 11:01.929
The victims were kids.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.064
Lots of victims
are children.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.165
Do you think about
your own family

11:05.198 --> 11:06.233
on every case?

11:06.266 --> 11:08.268
It's not--
No, I don't.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.170
It's...

11:10.203 --> 11:12.072
Look...

11:16.509 --> 11:18.879
The one girl was wearing
a teddy bear shirt

11:18.912 --> 11:20.347
that my daughter...

11:30.257 --> 11:32.359
Whatever.
It's done.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.763
You move on.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.898
I'm afraid that...

11:39.933 --> 11:42.335
that I won't be able
to handle it.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.939
But you are.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.277
By acknowledging
that it affects you.

11:50.310 --> 11:53.914
That's the way you handle
something traumatic.

11:57.284 --> 12:01.054
Well...

12:01.088 --> 12:04.825
I guess the real problem
is that I'm afraid that...

12:09.096 --> 12:11.398
that it's not working.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.282
C.S.U. collected these names
inside the house

12:29.316 --> 12:31.118
from paycheck stubs
in the mail.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.220
They're all female,
but the names on the socials

12:33.253 --> 12:34.988
are all fake.

12:35.022 --> 12:36.289
One of these women
has to come forward.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.425
The kids are lying unclaimed
in that morgue.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.061
I got Abraham's real I.D.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.030
His name is Eugene Hoff.

12:43.063 --> 12:43.931
How'd you get it?

12:43.964 --> 12:45.498
C.S.U. printed
all the common surfaces

12:45.532 --> 12:46.934
in the house.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.001
His prints hit.

12:48.035 --> 12:49.569
Eugene Hoff,
four arrests in the '80s

12:49.602 --> 12:51.471
for check forgery
and counterfeiting,

12:51.504 --> 12:53.106
identity theft

12:53.140 --> 12:54.041
and various frauds.

12:54.074 --> 12:57.010
He's no religious guru.
He's a con man.

12:57.044 --> 13:00.047
If this whole cult thing
is nothing more than a scam,

13:00.080 --> 13:01.481
why did he kill
only the kids?

13:01.514 --> 13:04.251
Where are their parents?

13:04.284 --> 13:05.585
Where are you going?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.154
Going home.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.455
What, are you kidding me?

13:08.488 --> 13:10.123
They're making you
take leave?

13:10.157 --> 13:12.225
No, I'm taking it myself.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.561
Sometimes you just
gotta step back.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.899
Come on.
I'll walk out with you.

13:26.439 --> 13:27.540
Our guy's last place
of employment

13:27.574 --> 13:29.309
was a Pentecostal
church.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.478
It's a place to start.

13:33.246 --> 13:34.181
What?

13:34.214 --> 13:37.384
They're gonna
send me home.

13:40.053 --> 13:42.355
No, they're not.
Yeah.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.992
I was way too emotional.
I couldn't hold it together.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.929
Elliot, can you
step in here?

14:02.242 --> 14:05.112
I'm referring you
to psych services.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.379
I just talked to them.

14:06.413 --> 14:10.317
We've determined you
require something ongoing.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.285
What do you want me to do.
You want me to cry?

14:12.319 --> 14:13.386
Is that it?

14:13.420 --> 14:14.988
If you won't take care
of yourself,

14:15.022 --> 14:16.023
then you have
to allow us--

14:16.056 --> 14:18.391
If you stayed out of my head
and let me do my job,

14:18.425 --> 14:19.927
there wouldn't
be a problem.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.262
You're out sick until
psych says you can return.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.469
It's a week at most.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.906
Take it.

14:36.276 --> 14:37.310
And you
don't need to be

14:37.344 --> 14:39.279
carrying a gun
around right now.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.342
Elliot...

15:09.376 --> 15:10.543
Detective Benson,

15:10.577 --> 15:11.644
you're with Munch.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.447
Captain--
Let him go.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.318
[door closes]

15:21.088 --> 15:22.189
Any word on Melanie?

15:22.222 --> 15:23.456
She's undergoing
minor surgery

15:23.490 --> 15:24.591
to stop premature labor.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.259
We can't talk to her
for a few hours.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.228
What about Elliot?

15:28.261 --> 15:30.497
He's not answering
his cell phone.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.232
Found some more info
on the church

15:32.265 --> 15:34.968
where Abraham worked.

15:35.002 --> 15:36.569
Christian Tabernacle of Grace.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.238
Pretty mainstream.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.107
Abraham preaches anything
that'll make him money.

15:40.140 --> 15:43.143
It's probably just
another con.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.711
Eugene signed up
for our Bible study fellowship

15:44.744 --> 15:46.379
when he joined the church.

15:46.413 --> 15:49.316
After a couple of months,
he asked for a more active role,

15:49.349 --> 15:52.585
and I made him director
of faith ministries.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.054
You must have been
pretty impressed with him

15:54.087 --> 15:55.122
to give him a job.

15:55.155 --> 15:57.090
I admit
I was fooled.

15:57.124 --> 16:00.427
Eugene's discussion groups
had nearly 100 members.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.295
He was very well-liked.

16:02.329 --> 16:03.630
So what happened
to change that?

16:03.663 --> 16:05.265
The more popular
he got,

16:05.298 --> 16:07.700
the more bizarre
he became.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.603
He preached that the serpent
was Christ.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.173
Explains his tattoo.
And people actually bought this?

16:13.206 --> 16:16.209
Ten families left the parish
when I fired him.

16:16.243 --> 16:18.745
She one of his followers?

16:18.778 --> 16:19.779
I don't recognize her.

16:19.812 --> 16:23.116
But I know one family
who left Eugene's group

16:23.150 --> 16:24.517
after a few years.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.419
They may be able
to tell you more.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.624
Abraham was magnetic.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.493
It was like he knew you.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.695
He could be talking
to a roomful of people

16:35.728 --> 16:38.331
and it was like you were
the only person there.

16:38.365 --> 16:41.201
But things changed.
He became paranoid.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.103
He kept telling us

16:43.136 --> 16:44.604
that we were gonna be
punished for our beliefs.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.439
That the government
was going to kill us,

16:46.473 --> 16:48.708
and we had to be ready
to defend ourselves.

16:48.741 --> 16:49.676
Meaning what?

16:49.709 --> 16:51.478
Collecting weapons.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.046
Trips
to the firing range.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.481
Storing food.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.049
He started
separating

16:56.083 --> 16:57.417
the married couples.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.719
He said you couldn't be
soldiers of God

16:59.752 --> 17:02.655
if you were slaves
to the flesh.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.424
The men slept on one floor,

17:04.457 --> 17:07.360
and the women always slept
on Abraham's floor.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.496
Eventually, he drove
most of the men away.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.763
What about the children?

17:13.666 --> 17:15.368
Janey...

17:15.402 --> 17:17.704
Go and do
your homework.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.712
Abraham always
talked about

17:25.745 --> 17:28.715
the purity and goodness
of children.

17:28.748 --> 17:31.584
But, really, he only
paid attention to the girls.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.823
One night, I caught him
in Janey's room.

17:36.856 --> 17:38.691
She was four.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.193
He was down
to his shorts.

17:40.227 --> 17:45.765
She told us that he never
touched her.

17:45.798 --> 17:49.169
But we left that night.

17:49.202 --> 17:52.739
Looking back,
I can't believe

17:52.772 --> 17:54.341
that we got caught up
in this.

17:54.374 --> 17:57.277
Look we know
how crazy he is now.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.846
But back then,
he was convincing.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.619
See for yourself.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.760
Are you willing to prove
your obedience?

18:13.793 --> 18:17.830
Because the time will come,
and you will be tested.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.799
When the soldiers of Satan
come for you,

18:19.832 --> 18:23.770
when they demand your allegiance
and threaten to murder you...

18:23.803 --> 18:25.172
and your children,

18:25.205 --> 18:28.641
and destroy all we have...

18:28.675 --> 18:32.779
Will you make that sacrifice
in the name of God?

18:32.812 --> 18:35.148
Yes?

18:36.316 --> 18:37.517
Yes.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.622
Guess that makes us
the soldiers of Satan.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.591
This guy isn't
too paranoid.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.426
He wants
his followers to be.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.927
It's part of
the manipulation.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.829
Instilling the idea
of being persecuted

18:49.862 --> 18:51.764
creates solidarity
and loyalty.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.766
Yeah, loyal enough to let him
rape their daughters.

18:53.800 --> 18:54.901
A lot of cult leaders
were known to have

18:54.934 --> 18:56.903
sexual relations with
the children in their groups.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.405
David Koresh had
a 10-year-old bride.

18:58.438 --> 18:59.939
The leader of the Nuwaubian cult
was convicted

18:59.972 --> 19:01.908
for molesting
14 children.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.243
Hold on one second.

19:03.276 --> 19:05.178
Captain, you're gonna
wanna take this.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.546
She'll only speak
to the person in charge.

19:06.579 --> 19:07.547
About what?
The victims.

19:07.580 --> 19:08.781
Wants to know
if one of them

19:08.815 --> 19:10.350
is a nine-year-old boy
with brown hair

19:10.383 --> 19:12.219
with a scar
on his left leg.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.420
Trace it.

19:14.521 --> 19:17.624
Agent George Wong,
Badge 5457939.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.826
I need a trace
on this line.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.093
(Cragen)
Captain Cragen.

19:21.127 --> 19:23.896
(woman)
I want to know about
the children who died.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.632
What's your name?

19:25.665 --> 19:26.766
I can't tell you.

19:26.799 --> 19:29.469
Okay, okay,
you don't have to.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.238
Just tell me if one of them
was a boy.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.973
Nine years old,
brown eyes, brown hair.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.876
We can arrange for you
to see all the bodies.

19:36.909 --> 19:39.779
That way you would be
absolutely sure.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.281
Please, tell me.

19:41.314 --> 19:42.915
Ma'am, you are not
in any trouble.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.217
We can--
[phone cuts off]

19:46.519 --> 19:47.954
Did we get it?

19:47.987 --> 19:51.291
Pay phone
at St. Catherine's hospital.

19:51.324 --> 19:55.495
Where Melanie is.
It's gotta be the mother.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.230
(Melanie)
I'm not talking to you!

19:57.264 --> 19:59.732
Melanie, I know that you
think that I wanna hurt you

19:59.766 --> 20:01.301
and your family,

20:01.334 --> 20:02.402
but that is not true.

20:02.435 --> 20:03.370
Just go away!

20:03.403 --> 20:06.005
Your mother was asking
about a little boy.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.274
Is that
your little brother?

20:07.307 --> 20:08.741
Is that Samuel?

20:10.477 --> 20:12.345
Melanie, do you
know what happened

20:12.379 --> 20:13.980
the night that you
came to the hospital?

20:14.013 --> 20:15.282
I'm not listening!

20:15.315 --> 20:16.883
Something terrible.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.718
Abraham is a liar.

20:18.751 --> 20:21.921
He killed your little brother.
He killed your friends.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.623
He might kill your mom.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.495
Now, I can protect her.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.597
But I need you to tell me
where she is.

20:37.337 --> 20:40.473
Mom said Abraham
was taking them

20:40.507 --> 20:42.842
to a safe place.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.648
Hey, you can't do this!

20:48.681 --> 20:50.450
This is a civil rights
violation.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.352
Relax.
Back here.

20:52.385 --> 20:55.288
They have the right to believe
in whatever they want.

20:57.357 --> 21:00.493
Which one of you
is Melanie's mother?

21:00.527 --> 21:01.928
Where's Abraham?

21:01.961 --> 21:02.995
As if
you don't know.

21:03.029 --> 21:04.431
Tell me where he is!

21:04.464 --> 21:05.865
You have our husband
in your torture rooms!

21:05.898 --> 21:07.734
You are a slave
to the devil!

21:07.767 --> 21:10.670
Detective Benson,
check it out.

21:12.439 --> 21:15.442
Got their own little Waco
down here.

21:19.346 --> 21:20.480
I'm gonna try
one more time.

21:20.513 --> 21:23.983
May I have your name, please,
as well as any aliases?

21:24.016 --> 21:27.320
I hereby christen you
Jane Doe Number Three.

21:27.354 --> 21:28.521
Nobody's carrying I.D.,

21:28.555 --> 21:29.856
and nobody's giving up
Abraham's location.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.691
And they're all apparently
married to him.

21:31.724 --> 21:32.892
They don't know
where he is.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.661
That's why they're
so frightened.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.429
The shepherd
has abandoned his flock.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.431
And they believe that we
killed their children.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.367
But one of these women
is Melanie's mother,

21:40.400 --> 21:42.502
and she's already strayed
from the flock by calling us.

21:42.535 --> 21:43.903
I just don't know
which one it is.

21:43.936 --> 21:46.406
Well, she's not gonna say
with the others around.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.840
We have to interview them
separately.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.842
Compare their voices
to the recorded phone call.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.344
We have their mug shots.

21:51.378 --> 21:53.413
Melanie's cooperating.
Let her pick mom out.

21:53.446 --> 21:54.514
Hell of a lot easier

21:54.547 --> 21:56.549
than trying to pry information
out of these people.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.084
Okay, I'll hit the hospital,
you hit the morgue.

21:58.117 --> 22:00.520
Warner's got something.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.455
Believe me, there's
nothing I'd like better

22:02.489 --> 22:04.524
than to help you put
a needle in your guy's arm,

22:04.557 --> 22:05.692
but this isn't good.

22:05.725 --> 22:07.360
How could it
possibly be worse?

22:07.394 --> 22:08.595
He didn't kill them.

22:08.628 --> 22:10.430
This is the oldest victim.

22:10.463 --> 22:11.964
I'm guessing around 20.

22:11.998 --> 22:14.367
Her injuries appear
self-inflected.

22:14.401 --> 22:15.735
It could be a set-up.

22:15.768 --> 22:18.638
And her right hand is covered
with gunshot residue.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.139
C.S.U. found
the murder weapon.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.608
Her prints
are the only ones on it.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.643
Abraham had total control
over all these kids.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.445
He orchestrated all of this.

22:25.478 --> 22:27.647
I'm just telling you
what the forensics prove.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.682
The DNA tells another story.

22:29.716 --> 22:32.552
I'm estimating this girl
around 16.

22:32.585 --> 22:33.820
This boy, around two.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.021
She's his mother.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.956
And I'll bet Abraham's
his father.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.425
All of the victims
have the same father,

22:38.458 --> 22:39.792
except the shooter.

22:39.826 --> 22:41.461
Abraham, father of many,

22:41.494 --> 22:42.562
had children
with his own children.

22:42.595 --> 22:43.896
Now we know why.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.432
Why what?

22:45.465 --> 22:47.800
Abraham's nothing more
than an incestuous pedophile.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.068
You kill the victims,

22:49.101 --> 22:50.537
nobody can testify
against you.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.071
There's still
one victim left.

22:52.104 --> 22:53.506
The 12-year-old
in the hospital

22:53.540 --> 22:55.442
who's having his baby.

22:59.612 --> 23:02.381
Melanie?

23:07.153 --> 23:10.423
Excuse me...
I'm looking for Melanie Ophion.

23:10.457 --> 23:11.558
Where is she?

23:11.591 --> 23:13.159
I just got on.
They may have moved her.

23:13.192 --> 23:14.827
Let me check.

23:17.530 --> 23:19.699
Hey, wait, uh,
have you seen your roommate?

23:19.732 --> 23:21.000
Melanie?
Yeah.

23:21.033 --> 23:23.470
Earlier today, but her dad
already took her home.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.480
No luck finding Melanie?

23:33.513 --> 23:34.747
Hospital security cameras

23:34.781 --> 23:36.215
recorded her walking out
with Abraham.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.884
She didn't look like
she was being forced.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.185
She wasn't.

23:39.218 --> 23:40.186
This cult
is all she knows.

23:40.219 --> 23:42.455
She went with Abraham
because she wanted to.

23:42.489 --> 23:44.957
You find her mother?

23:44.991 --> 23:46.893
This woman says
that her name is Sarah.

23:46.926 --> 23:50.963
She won't admit to anything,
but listen to her voice.

23:50.997 --> 23:52.965
(Cragen over P.A.)
You're willing to go to jail
for this guy's crimes?

23:52.999 --> 23:55.134
I'm willing
to make a sacrifice

23:55.167 --> 23:58.505
in the name
of God the father.

23:58.538 --> 24:00.907
Just tell me
if one of them was a boy.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.610
Nine years old,
brown eyes, brown hair.

24:03.643 --> 24:05.978
That's all I needed to hear.

24:10.650 --> 24:13.620
Detective Benson,
this is Sarah.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.021
We've been talking

24:15.054 --> 24:16.188
about numbers.

24:16.222 --> 24:17.957
We found this
in her pocket.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.726
What does it mean?

24:19.759 --> 24:21.928
She hasn't shared that.

24:24.664 --> 24:27.934
Sarah was Abraham's wife
in the Bible, right?

24:30.136 --> 24:32.138
From what I recall,

24:32.171 --> 24:34.173
Sarah whored out her servant
to her husband

24:34.206 --> 24:35.775
so that he could
have a child.

24:37.243 --> 24:39.011
Is that why
you let Abraham

24:39.045 --> 24:40.112
have sex
with your daughter?

24:40.146 --> 24:42.048
Of course,
your Abraham is different,

24:42.081 --> 24:43.550
because he likes
to have children

24:43.583 --> 24:44.751
with his own children.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.953
Melanie is not
his daughter!

24:46.986 --> 24:48.187
And we're supposed
to believe you now

24:48.220 --> 24:50.189
because you've been
so forthcoming?

24:50.222 --> 24:52.158
Her father abandoned us
when she was a baby.

24:52.191 --> 24:54.661
Abraham took care of us.

24:54.694 --> 24:55.461
Abraham raped
your daughter!

24:55.494 --> 24:57.196
I don't expect you
to understand!

24:57.229 --> 24:58.665
Don't try to tell me
for a minute

24:58.698 --> 24:59.799
that you believe
this is right,

24:59.832 --> 25:01.000
because I know
you don't.

25:01.033 --> 25:03.069
You took Melanie
to the hospital.

25:03.102 --> 25:05.805
You called us to see if Abraham
had murdered your son!

25:05.838 --> 25:08.140
No!
No, your son was shot.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.942
Along with all
these other children!

25:11.678 --> 25:13.646
Now, those women out there
might be brainwashed,

25:13.680 --> 25:14.847
but you're not.

25:14.881 --> 25:16.315
You know exactly
what he is:

25:16.348 --> 25:17.917
a murderer
and a child rapist.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.019
That's not true!
You knew who he was,

25:20.052 --> 25:21.988
and you let this happen!

25:22.021 --> 25:23.556
You let
all those children die.

25:23.590 --> 25:24.724
It was God's will!

25:24.757 --> 25:26.292
No, Sarah,
it was your will!

25:26.325 --> 25:28.761
You can blame God,
and you can blame Abraham,

25:28.795 --> 25:31.130
but we all know the truth--
you did this!

25:31.163 --> 25:33.165
You sat there
and you watched

25:33.199 --> 25:35.234
as a man raped
one of your children

25:35.267 --> 25:36.603
and then murdered the other!

25:36.636 --> 25:38.204
You might as well
have killed them yourself!

25:38.237 --> 25:39.972
Olivia!

25:42.008 --> 25:44.811
He has one of your children.

25:44.844 --> 25:47.313
And he has
your unborn grandchild.

25:53.753 --> 25:55.688
This is a test.

25:57.624 --> 25:59.258
I won't be tempted.

26:05.264 --> 26:07.834
[door slams]

26:09.969 --> 26:12.238
Captain, those numbers

26:12.271 --> 26:13.873
Sarah was carrying
around with her--

26:13.906 --> 26:14.874
bank accounts.

26:14.907 --> 26:15.975
How'd you
figure that out?

26:16.008 --> 26:17.309
Forensic accountant did.

26:17.343 --> 26:18.210
Sequence of 10 numbers,

26:18.244 --> 26:19.712
all starting with
four identical digits.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.347
Same branch
of the same bank.

26:21.380 --> 26:22.749
Whose bank accounts?

26:22.782 --> 26:25.051
All different names,
all closed yesterday.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.353
Somebody walked away
with 600 thou.

26:27.386 --> 26:28.855
Abraham.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.389
Sarah must have
closed those accounts

26:30.422 --> 26:32.859
and given the money
to Abraham before we got her.

26:32.892 --> 26:34.961
You don't get that kind of money
by passing the hat.

26:34.994 --> 26:36.863
Accountant says most of the
deposits were payroll checks

26:36.896 --> 26:38.665
from large corporations.

26:38.698 --> 26:40.800
Easy to counterfeit,
because it takes longer

26:40.833 --> 26:42.368
for the companies
to catch on.

26:42.401 --> 26:45.071
Abe has fallen back
on his old career.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.338
We thinking
it's a coincidence

26:46.372 --> 26:48.074
he does all his bogus banking
in one place?

26:48.107 --> 26:49.809
No.

26:49.842 --> 26:52.278
He must have had
an inside guy.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.714
Make him come out.

26:57.684 --> 27:00.286
I told you I'd take you
someplace special.

27:00.319 --> 27:03.255
I don't know.
We could go to Tampa, stay--

27:03.289 --> 27:05.925
Excuse me, who do you
think you are?

27:05.958 --> 27:08.661
Is your employee number
419686, Reg?

27:10.096 --> 27:11.430
Uh, what exactly
is this regarding?

27:11.463 --> 27:13.132
Your creative
banking activity.

27:13.165 --> 27:15.167
Setting up bogus accounts
for your pal Abraham.

27:15.201 --> 27:18.137
Cashing his phony checks
and taking a cut for yourself.

27:18.170 --> 27:20.339
Now, your boss is on the phone
with the F.B.I.,

27:20.372 --> 27:24.143
who I'm sure would love
to have a little chat with you.

27:24.176 --> 27:25.277
Oh, my God.

27:25.311 --> 27:26.278
God's not gonna
help you, Reg.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.681
He doesn't like fraud
committed in his name.

27:28.715 --> 27:29.348
I want a lawyer.

27:29.381 --> 27:30.850
Oh, you're
gonna need one.

27:30.883 --> 27:32.051
You're screwed.

27:32.084 --> 27:34.320
But I bet if you help us
find Abraham,

27:34.353 --> 27:36.723
it would look
very good for you.

27:37.924 --> 27:39.692
He's coming in
this afternoon.

27:39.726 --> 27:41.360
There's one more account.

27:41.393 --> 27:43.696
It's got more money
than the rest combined.

27:46.298 --> 27:47.800
(Cragen on radio)
All units be advised:

27:47.834 --> 27:49.435
No one is to approach
the subject

27:49.468 --> 27:51.403
until the girl
is in custody.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.811
I got a visual
on the subject.

27:58.845 --> 28:01.714
The subject is walking
east toward the bank

28:01.748 --> 28:03.750
on the south side
of the street.

28:03.783 --> 28:06.018
Got a baseball hat
and gray pants,

28:06.052 --> 28:07.286
and a white shirt.

28:07.319 --> 28:08.387
The girl is not with him.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.790
I repeat,
the girl is not with him.

28:10.823 --> 28:12.458
He's entering
the bank now.

28:12.491 --> 28:14.226
I'm counting on you, Reggie,
so don't screw this up.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.062
You're gonna have to slip
the G.P.S. tracker

28:16.095 --> 28:18.497
in with the money.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.399
He's here.

28:20.432 --> 28:22.501
Take a few
deep breaths,

28:22.534 --> 28:24.003
relax, and just pretend

28:24.036 --> 28:25.071
you're embezzling
thousands of dollars,

28:25.104 --> 28:26.472
like it's any other day.

28:26.505 --> 28:29.308
Thank you for banking
with us, sir.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.744
Yes, Mr. Smith.

28:31.778 --> 28:33.379
What can I do
for you today?

28:33.412 --> 28:35.948
I wanna close
my account.

28:35.982 --> 28:38.084
Subject made contact.

28:38.117 --> 28:40.953
Abe doesn't
look too happy.

28:40.987 --> 28:42.955
What the hell
is Reggie saying?

28:42.989 --> 28:44.523
It bounced,
and I just don't wanna--

28:44.556 --> 28:46.258
Don't mess this up.

28:46.292 --> 28:47.960
We got a problem.
Reggie sucks at this.

28:47.994 --> 28:51.430
He's making
Abraham suspicious.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.532
He knows something's up.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.034
I think this is blown.

29:00.239 --> 29:01.473
(Cragen)
Police!
Don't move.

29:01.507 --> 29:02.508
Don't be stupid,
Abraham.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.777
(Munch)
You got no place
to go, Abe.

29:04.811 --> 29:06.512
Put your hands
where I can see them.

29:06.545 --> 29:07.246
Get down on the floor.

29:07.279 --> 29:10.149
Get down
on the floor, now!

29:13.886 --> 29:17.356
Into thy hands
I commend my spirit!

29:17.389 --> 29:19.358
Uhh!

29:23.262 --> 29:26.565
It's over now.
You tell me where's Melanie?

29:26.598 --> 29:28.534
Safe with our Father now.

29:28.567 --> 29:31.437
All nations rightly
give him praise.

29:41.948 --> 29:44.016
You've been out there
a long time.

29:44.050 --> 29:45.551
(Benson)
Where's Melanie?

29:45.584 --> 29:48.054
I already told you.

29:50.122 --> 29:53.025
You said that she's
with our Father.

29:56.863 --> 29:58.597
Does that mean
that she's dead?

29:58.630 --> 29:59.966
Melanie will enjoy

29:59.999 --> 30:01.367
everlasting life,

30:01.400 --> 30:03.069
as will all who believe.

30:03.102 --> 30:04.170
Believe in you.

30:04.203 --> 30:06.372
No, I'm just
the messenger.

30:06.405 --> 30:07.840
What message are you sending

30:07.874 --> 30:10.309
by raping
and murdering children?

30:10.342 --> 30:11.878
I killed no one.

30:12.979 --> 30:14.881
So Melanie's alive?

30:19.418 --> 30:23.289
It's interesting that you're
in here with me alone.

30:23.322 --> 30:26.192
Do you like putting yourself
in dangerous situations?

30:26.225 --> 30:30.429
You consider yourself
dangerous?
No.

30:30.462 --> 30:33.933
But you don't know that.

30:33.966 --> 30:36.202
I wonder what attracts you
to such a dangerous job.

30:36.235 --> 30:39.071
What makes you do it.

30:39.105 --> 30:42.541
Rapists and pedophiles
like you.

30:42.574 --> 30:44.911
So it's not just about
arresting criminals.

30:44.944 --> 30:48.047
It's about
those specific criminals.

30:48.080 --> 30:51.417
You're drawn to this.

30:51.450 --> 30:54.954
Why?
Were you raped?

30:56.555 --> 30:59.358
Tell me where Melanie is.

30:59.391 --> 31:00.893
How can you stand it?

31:00.927 --> 31:02.028
How can you

31:02.061 --> 31:04.931
invite this depravity

31:04.964 --> 31:06.966
into your mind...

31:06.999 --> 31:09.401
your body, your soul?

31:11.137 --> 31:13.272
It will kill you.

31:13.305 --> 31:17.176
Every horror,
every torment

31:17.209 --> 31:18.544
afflicts your body.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.212
Like a cancer.

31:22.414 --> 31:26.118
It's devouring you,
and you can't see it.

31:28.020 --> 31:30.656
Open your eyes.

31:33.092 --> 31:36.462
You know, I thought
that you were just

31:36.495 --> 31:39.165
another con artist.

31:39.198 --> 31:41.500
Seeking out people
who were starved

31:41.533 --> 31:46.038
for anything that would
give them meaning in their life.

31:46.072 --> 31:48.240
They're easy marks.

31:48.274 --> 31:51.410
You talk about God
and the apocalypse,

31:51.443 --> 31:53.579
and they give you
all of their money.

31:53.612 --> 31:58.150
But you are much more
pathetic than that.

31:58.184 --> 32:01.487
You actually believe
your own hype.

32:05.157 --> 32:07.693
You've conned yourself.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.043
This guy's not gonna
tell us anything.

32:24.076 --> 32:25.544
Then we have a problem.

32:25.577 --> 32:27.113
Our best shot
at getting an indictment

32:27.146 --> 32:28.080
was Melanie's testimony.

32:28.114 --> 32:30.216
Without her, I can't
convert the complaint.

32:30.249 --> 32:32.985
His 16-year-old daughter
and their two-year-old son

32:33.019 --> 32:34.153
are lying
in that morgue.

32:34.186 --> 32:36.055
As soon as Abraham's DNA
comes back,

32:36.088 --> 32:38.090
we got him on statutory rape
and incest.

32:38.124 --> 32:39.425
Not unless you've got
a birth certificate

32:39.458 --> 32:41.193
that supports
that theory.

32:41.227 --> 32:43.195
Don't need a birth certificate
if we've got his chromosomes.

32:43.229 --> 32:44.130
First,
I would like you

32:44.163 --> 32:45.631
to prove that my client

32:45.664 --> 32:48.100
acknowledged the woman
was his biological daughter.

32:48.134 --> 32:49.201
She wasn't a woman.

32:49.235 --> 32:50.669
She was 15
when she got pregnant.

32:50.702 --> 32:52.504
That's your M.E.'s
estimation.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.140
But no judge
would take a guess

32:54.173 --> 32:56.042
as proof of age.

32:56.075 --> 32:58.444
So...no statutory rape,

32:58.477 --> 33:00.079
no incest,

33:00.112 --> 33:01.647
and your murderer
killed herself.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.650
I guess we're all ready
to go home now.

33:04.683 --> 33:06.218
I don't like
that look, Casey.

33:06.252 --> 33:07.453
I don't like
that he's right.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.321
We have seven victims.

33:09.355 --> 33:11.057
Charge Abraham
with murder.

33:11.090 --> 33:12.524
Charge him with conspiracy
to commit murder.

33:12.558 --> 33:13.725
There's no point!

33:13.759 --> 33:14.926
All the forensics
acquit him.

33:14.960 --> 33:17.429
The gunshot residue was only
on the oldest victim's hands.

33:17.463 --> 33:20.032
Charles Manson wasn't present
for the Tate murders,

33:20.066 --> 33:21.600
but they still convicted him
for killing them.

33:21.633 --> 33:23.202
Because members
of his cult testified

33:23.235 --> 33:24.770
that Manson ordered it.

33:24.803 --> 33:26.672
Can you flip any
of Abraham's followers?

33:26.705 --> 33:29.208
No. Melanie's mother
was our best shot,

33:29.241 --> 33:30.742
and she just began
a hunger strike

33:30.776 --> 33:33.279
protesting our persecution
of her religion.

33:33.312 --> 33:35.181
Well, then,
Melanie's our only chance.

33:35.214 --> 33:37.249
If she testifies that Abraham
orchestrated this,

33:37.283 --> 33:39.618
we can get him on
the rape and the murders.

33:39.651 --> 33:41.187
How long can we
keep him in custody?

33:41.220 --> 33:42.688
Check fraud
will keep him tonight,

33:42.721 --> 33:44.523
but he'll be out on bail
tomorrow afternoon,

33:44.556 --> 33:45.791
unless I get
something new.

33:45.824 --> 33:47.259
We'll put a detail on him

33:47.293 --> 33:49.361
the minute he leaves
that courthouse.

33:49.395 --> 33:51.163
That account that Abraham
tried to close out today

33:51.197 --> 33:52.431
had over
a million dollars in it.

33:52.464 --> 33:53.832
Under the name and social
of John Kramer,

33:53.865 --> 33:55.201
Englewood, New Jersey.

33:55.234 --> 33:57.203
Another alias
Abraham used?

33:57.236 --> 33:58.304
This time the guy is real,

33:58.337 --> 33:59.505
only missing.

33:59.538 --> 34:02.141
He vanished with his wife
and daughter about 10 years ago.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.675
Daughter was only two
at the time.

34:03.709 --> 34:09.681
She'd be around 12 now.
Named Melanie.

34:09.715 --> 34:12.218
Who reported them
missing?

34:12.251 --> 34:14.653
Kramer's parents,
now deceased.

34:14.686 --> 34:15.787
Missing persons'

34:15.821 --> 34:17.856
database lists the contacts
as Detective Stu McKenzie,

34:17.889 --> 34:19.325
Englewood P.D.

34:19.358 --> 34:22.761
Find out
what he remembers.

34:22.794 --> 34:23.629
(Benson)
The wife's name was Cindy?

34:23.662 --> 34:25.797
Yeah, she didn't
have any family.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.766
Husband's parents died
hoping we'd find them alive.

34:27.799 --> 34:30.502
Always figured this case
was some weird cult thing.

34:30.536 --> 34:31.770
What made you
think of that?

34:31.803 --> 34:32.671
Well, Kramer's parents

34:32.704 --> 34:34.406
knew he got in
with this church group.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.641
Was real secretive
about it.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.776
Donated his trust fund
to the cause.

34:37.809 --> 34:39.278
You ever run into
this guy?

34:39.311 --> 34:40.479
Nope, but Kramer
and his group

34:40.512 --> 34:41.813
lived totally
off the grid.

34:41.847 --> 34:44.816
No known address, no phone,
no utilities, no jobs.

34:44.850 --> 34:47.719
Only contact with the parents
was a letter demanding the money

34:47.753 --> 34:49.188
in his daughter's trust fund.

34:49.221 --> 34:51.523
How much is that worth?

34:51.557 --> 34:52.624
Mmm, about two mil,

34:52.658 --> 34:54.493
available when the girl
turns 21

34:54.526 --> 34:56.462
or has a baby,
whichever comes first.

34:56.495 --> 34:58.330
Explains Abraham's reason
for keeping Melanie alive.

34:58.364 --> 34:59.798
At least until
she delivers.

34:59.831 --> 35:01.900
Where does Kramer's
trail end?

35:01.933 --> 35:03.869
Last known activity
was charging up

35:03.902 --> 35:05.737
some construction supplies
on a credit card

35:05.771 --> 35:06.338
his mom paid for.

35:06.372 --> 35:07.373
Severino Building Supply.

35:07.406 --> 35:09.675
Three grand in drywall
and tiles, ten years ago.

35:09.708 --> 35:11.177
You know, neighbors said
something about

35:11.210 --> 35:12.144
middle-of-the-night
construction

35:12.178 --> 35:13.912
going on at Abraham's place
around that time.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.581
We searched that place
top to bottom.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.184
Didn't check the walls.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.290
No building permits
were ever issued

35:24.323 --> 35:25.624
while your guy
owned this place,

35:25.657 --> 35:27.459
so basically we're
looking for a room

35:27.493 --> 35:29.395
that shouldn't be here.

35:29.428 --> 35:31.197
Tiles narrowed it down.

35:31.230 --> 35:32.864
According
to the building plans...

35:32.898 --> 35:34.766
[cell phone rings]

35:34.800 --> 35:36.868
this is supposed to be
the exterior wall.

35:36.902 --> 35:38.504
Benson.

35:38.537 --> 35:39.871
Now it's just a matter

35:39.905 --> 35:41.207
of x-raying the walls.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.874
Somebody's in there,
we'll find them.

35:42.908 --> 35:45.577
Cragen said that Abraham just
lost his surveillance detail

35:45.611 --> 35:46.678
at Grand Central.

35:46.712 --> 35:48.880
He could be anywhere now.

35:48.914 --> 35:50.249
Detectives,
come on over here.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.571
Here's Johnny.

36:16.575 --> 36:18.544
(Benson)
What is this sand?

36:18.577 --> 36:20.446
Kitty litter,
to absorb the odor.

36:20.479 --> 36:22.714
We better test for DNA to
make sure this is John Kramer.

36:22.748 --> 36:26.184
There could be 25 bodies
in these walls.

36:31.423 --> 36:34.493
It's him.
John Kramer.

36:34.526 --> 36:35.994
Yeah, somebody
better tell Sarah

36:36.027 --> 36:37.529
or Cindy or whatever
her name is.

36:37.563 --> 36:38.630
She thinks he left her.

36:38.664 --> 36:40.366
I wonder who
told her that.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.371
(Benson)
You recognize that?

36:45.404 --> 36:47.439
Cindy...

36:47.473 --> 36:49.275
Her name is Sarah, detective.
Get your cases straight.

36:49.308 --> 36:52.244
It belonged to John,
your husband.

36:52.278 --> 36:53.512
The one that you said

36:53.545 --> 36:54.846
abandoned you
10 years ago.

37:04.423 --> 37:06.258
This is what's left
of him.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.996
He was shot
in the back of the head

37:11.029 --> 37:15.967
and buried in the wall
in the house where you lived.

37:16.001 --> 37:19.638
You're accusing my client
of murder?

37:19.671 --> 37:22.474
No. Just of being stupid.

37:22.508 --> 37:24.343
And gullible.

37:26.378 --> 37:28.880
You know,
it's interesting

37:28.914 --> 37:30.682
how Abraham
only surrounds himself

37:30.716 --> 37:33.652
with women and girls.

37:33.685 --> 37:35.020
There's no men anywhere.

37:35.053 --> 37:39.358
I wonder if he didn't
like the competition.

37:39.391 --> 37:41.360
No.
No?

37:42.928 --> 37:44.430
He killed your husband.

37:46.031 --> 37:48.567
The father of your child.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.969
What exactly
does he have to do

37:51.002 --> 37:53.038
for you to stop defending him?

37:53.071 --> 37:54.973
Abraham told me...

37:55.006 --> 37:57.075
that John fell in love
with another woman.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.044
And I believe him.

38:04.049 --> 38:06.852
He was wearing it
when he died.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.796
What do you want
from her?

38:17.829 --> 38:21.333
Abraham was last seen
at Grand Central Station.

38:23.034 --> 38:24.035
He's going to wherever

38:24.069 --> 38:26.071
he's keeping Melanie.

38:26.104 --> 38:28.073
Now, she's gonna
have her baby,

38:28.106 --> 38:32.611
he's gonna get his hands
on her trust fund,

38:32.644 --> 38:34.446
and then your daughter
is dead.

38:38.584 --> 38:39.885
Where are they?

38:39.918 --> 38:41.353
(attorney)
What are you offering?

38:41.387 --> 38:43.121
A chance to do
the right thing for Melanie.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.691
Something you've never done
her entire life.

38:45.724 --> 38:46.892
That's not good enough.

38:46.925 --> 38:48.994
Up north.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.664
This warehouse.

39:23.929 --> 39:25.631
Okay.

39:30.168 --> 39:31.169
Melanie...

39:31.202 --> 39:33.171
Are you okay?

39:33.204 --> 39:35.407
I'm gonna take you
someplace safe, all right?

39:35.441 --> 39:37.609
He's comin'.

39:44.616 --> 39:45.684
Don't move!

39:45.717 --> 39:46.885
Put the bag down.

39:48.053 --> 39:50.155
Walk towards me!

39:50.188 --> 39:51.557
Stop!

39:53.759 --> 39:55.093
They're gonna
take you away.

39:55.126 --> 39:56.828
They're gonna
kill your baby.

39:56.862 --> 39:59.164
It's over, Eugene.
You can't control her anymore.

39:59.197 --> 40:00.866
Come on, darlin'.
Come on.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.167
Get him out of here!

40:02.200 --> 40:03.201
[gunshot]

40:03.234 --> 40:04.570
Oh!

40:04.603 --> 40:06.572
(radio)
Who's shooting, ZermeÃ±o?

40:06.605 --> 40:08.073
Don't answer that!
Listen to me, sweetheart.

40:08.106 --> 40:09.775
I know you didn't mean
to do that.

40:09.808 --> 40:11.142
Tell her to shut up.
Shut up.

40:11.176 --> 40:12.143
Sweetheart, listen to me.

40:12.177 --> 40:13.512
Shut up!

40:13.545 --> 40:15.213
What you gonna do,
detective?

40:15.246 --> 40:17.115
Shoot a pregnant child?
You son of a bitch.

40:17.148 --> 40:18.149
Don't do that, officer.

40:18.183 --> 40:20.051
She already
shot you once.

40:20.085 --> 40:21.953
(radio)
We're comin' in.
Tell them to stay back,

40:21.987 --> 40:23.021
or she'll kill you both.

40:23.054 --> 40:25.056
Do it!

40:25.090 --> 40:26.458
I'll kill you.

40:26.492 --> 40:27.893
(radio)
Detective Benson, respond.

40:27.926 --> 40:31.062
Okay. Okay.

40:31.096 --> 40:32.831
Everybody stay back.

40:32.864 --> 40:34.466
I repeat, stay back.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.067
(radio)
We copy.
All units stand down.

40:36.101 --> 40:39.671
Melanie, I need you
to listen to me, okay?

40:39.705 --> 40:41.507
I need you
to let Officer ZermeÃ±o go.

40:41.540 --> 40:42.574
No.

40:42.608 --> 40:43.909
Melanie, look at him.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.777
He's bleeding,
and he's very sick

40:45.811 --> 40:46.878
and he needs a doctor,
okay?

40:46.912 --> 40:49.214
Now, I promise you,
I'm gonna stay in here with you.

40:49.247 --> 40:50.015
Okay?
You and me.

40:50.048 --> 40:53.251
I'm gonna stay
right with you.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.086
Get out of here, Z.
No way.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.188
I'm not leaving you alone
with these guys.

40:57.222 --> 40:58.724
Get out of here
now, officer!

41:00.559 --> 41:02.127
So what's your plan
now, Eugene?

41:07.165 --> 41:09.100
Everything I predicted
has come true.

41:09.134 --> 41:10.268
Do you believe now?

41:10.301 --> 41:12.103
He's lying, Melanie.

41:12.137 --> 41:14.205
They tried to destroy us,
but we're strong in the Lord.

41:14.239 --> 41:16.274
Melanie, listen to me.
Know how I found you?

41:16.307 --> 41:17.142
She's working for Satan.

41:17.175 --> 41:19.044
Your mother told me
where you were.

41:19.077 --> 41:22.047
Because she wants me
to get you away from him.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.649
Melanie, no.

41:23.682 --> 41:25.250
Melanie,
he killed your father.

41:25.283 --> 41:26.718
All who believe
will rise up again.

41:26.752 --> 41:27.953
For his money.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.120
That's all he cares about,
sweetheart.

41:29.154 --> 41:30.756
He does not
care about you.

41:30.789 --> 41:32.991
You're a liar!
He gave me a baby!

41:33.024 --> 41:34.626
Melanie, I'm sorry.

41:34.660 --> 41:37.162
And I know this
is very hard to hear.

41:37.195 --> 41:38.196
Because he was supposed

41:38.229 --> 41:40.098
to take care of you.

41:40.131 --> 41:42.267
But he made you do things
you didn't want to do.

41:42.300 --> 41:44.135
She's lying.
He hurt you.

41:44.169 --> 41:48.940
And he knew what he was doing
was wrong.

41:48.974 --> 41:52.010
Now, you listen to both of us
very carefully, sweetheart.

41:52.043 --> 41:53.912
She says she's
telling you the truth.

41:53.945 --> 41:55.614
But you know me.

41:55.647 --> 41:58.249
I've loved you,
and I've cared for you,

41:58.283 --> 42:00.952
and I've taught you
all your life.

42:00.986 --> 42:02.320
Now you have to decide

42:02.353 --> 42:04.255
which one of us
is telling the truth.

42:04.289 --> 42:05.657
No, Melanie!

42:05.691 --> 42:09.127
And the liar
must be punished.

42:09.160 --> 42:10.328
You do not take
another step.

42:10.361 --> 42:12.798
Or what,
you'll shoot me?

42:12.831 --> 42:14.299
You'll kill me?!

42:14.332 --> 42:16.935
Do you see the evil, Melanie?!
Shoot her!
No!

42:16.968 --> 42:18.904
No, Melanie!
No!

42:18.937 --> 42:20.872
Shoot her!
Come on!

42:20.906 --> 42:23.174
All these men
have come to kill me!

42:23.208 --> 42:26.144
Why?!
Because they know!

42:26.177 --> 42:28.179
They know that I am
greater than man!

42:28.213 --> 42:30.115
I am greater than God!

42:30.148 --> 42:31.950
And they're afraid
of what I can do!

42:31.983 --> 42:34.285
[gunshot]

42:34.319 --> 42:36.588
[crying]

42:41.292 --> 42:42.694
Melanie, it's okay.

42:42.728 --> 42:43.962
It's okay, honey.

42:43.995 --> 42:46.698
It's okay.
Put the gun down.

42:46.732 --> 42:47.966
It's okay.

42:50.201 --> 42:51.637
It's okay.

42:51.670 --> 42:53.338
It's okay.

42:53.371 --> 42:54.640
It's okay.

42:55.774 --> 42:57.275
That was a lie.

42:57.308 --> 43:01.279
What was?

43:01.312 --> 43:04.115
He said he was
greater than God.

43:04.149 --> 43:06.652
But nobody is.
