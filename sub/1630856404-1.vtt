Nice costume.

Mustache really suits you.

03:07.428 --> 03:09.362
I'll get the drop on you

You taking some time off?

03:34.785 --> 03:36.422
Yeah. Just let me
ask my boss.

03:36.457 --> 03:38.589
Well, you know me.

03:38.624 --> 03:40.250
I'm a "mission first" guy.

03:40.285 --> 03:42.857
The bigger question is,

03:42.892 --> 03:44.463
are you ready to be a dad?

03:47.402 --> 03:48.269
Were you?

03:50.438 --> 03:51.569
Nope.

04:14.055 --> 04:16.187
<i> you'd get your hearing back.</i>

04:16.222 --> 04:17.628
<i> I insisted.</i>

[doctor, echoing]
It's extremely rare.

04:20.292 --> 04:22.633
The injury to his ears
has made them hypersensitive

04:22.668 --> 04:24.228

He can hear everything.

04:31.974 --> 04:33.413
[cacophony roars]

04:33.448 --> 04:35.206
In time,
he'll learn to filter out

04:35.241 --> 04:37.109
the different sounds
so he can function.

04:37.144 --> 04:40.684
It would be a terrible weakness
if he can't control it.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.917
Or a strength.

<i> You did get your hearing back,</i>

04:50.355 --> 04:51.959
<i> and it became an asset.</i>

It all hurts! Stop it!
Hey, it's me. It's okay.

It's okay. You're safe.

05:02.609 --> 05:04.840
I can't take the place
of your father,

05:04.875 --> 05:06.446
but if you give me a chance,

05:06.481 --> 05:09.306
maybe we can make
a family of our own.

05:09.341 --> 05:11.011
You know,
there's plenty of stuff

05:11.046 --> 05:13.684
I'd do over again,
if I had half the chance,

05:13.719 --> 05:17.820
but adopting you, helping you
become the man you've become...

05:17.855 --> 05:19.558
You're the best thing
I ever did.

05:21.056 --> 05:22.891
You're gonna be my legacy.

with sole access

05:49.150 --> 05:52.382
to his contacts, stolen intel,
and the account numbers

05:52.417 --> 05:53.856
of the hundreds of millions
he's made

05:53.891 --> 05:55.385
selling out our country.

05:55.420 --> 05:56.694
We want it all back.

05:56.729 --> 05:58.058
You need to download
the contents

05:58.093 --> 05:59.895

05:59.930 --> 06:02.227
It's linked to a heart monitor
in the watch.

06:02.262 --> 06:04.262
It stops,

there's nobody like you.

Tonight?
Right. Clock is ticking.

33:20.063 --> 33:23.207
Well, the eight dead federal

33:23.242 --> 33:24.670
Why now,
after all this time?

35:15.882 --> 35:17.783

Good. Thanks for your support.

Yeah. Take care.
Cheers.

this isn't a social call?

I'm afraid not.

Hey. Here's some skim milk
for your skim-milk coffee.

I didn't check the label,
but I'm sure it's okay.

35:35.737 --> 35:37.671
When's the last time you were
in touch with Peter Barrett?

35:39.202 --> 35:40.476
Peter Barrett?

35:40.511 --> 35:41.708
The Painter, sir.

35:41.743 --> 35:44.612
Oh, I know who he is,
Agent Kim.

35:44.647 --> 35:46.218
He's my kid, you see.

35:46.820 --> 35:49.584
I want to know when the last
time you spoke with him was.

35:49.619 --> 35:52.422
It's been years,
and you know it. What's up?

35:52.457 --> 35:55.557
Your boy murdered eight
federal agents in cold blood.

35:56.186 --> 35:57.361
What?

35:58.430 --> 35:59.726
Federal agents?

35:59.761 --> 36:01.123
They were there
to question him.

36:01.158 --> 36:02.828
You don't send a wet team in

36:02.863 --> 36:05.468
to question someone like Peter,
and you know that.

36:05.503 --> 36:06.832
And you didn't call me?

36:06.867 --> 36:08.306
We have intel
he's in possession

36:08.341 --> 36:10.000
of highly-sensitive material.

36:10.035 --> 36:11.936
He's a national security threat.

36:12.873 --> 36:14.202
How'd you find him?

36:14.237 --> 36:15.841
The question we should be asking

36:15.876 --> 36:17.975
is why would your son steal
classified documents

36:18.010 --> 36:19.944
from the U.S. government?

36:19.979 --> 36:21.319
What's his motive?

36:21.354 --> 36:23.079
Is Peter being set up?

36:23.114 --> 36:24.817
Is the company
covering its tracks,

36:24.852 --> 36:26.786
and using you to do that?
Oh, no, sir.

36:26.821 --> 36:29.184
We are just trying to get
to the bottom of this.

36:30.121 --> 36:31.857
Do you know
where Peter would go,

36:31.892 --> 36:33.529
or what he would want
with this intel?

36:33.564 --> 36:36.224
I don't know anything,
Agent Kim.

36:36.259 --> 36:38.061
But I'll get
to the bottom of it.

for you both to leave.

Of course. What do you need?

You're good
with computers, right?

37:44.899 --> 37:46.701

what you're talking about,

Maybe they can find something.

43:21.972 --> 43:23.400
I can't.

43:24.810 --> 43:27.305
Did you know
he's an actual painter?

43:27.340 --> 43:29.714
Like, with fancy paints
and everything? It's not bad.

43:29.749 --> 43:32.079
Nice lines, good color.
Bit derivative.

43:32.114 --> 43:34.081
Not my taste, but...

43:34.116 --> 43:35.918
I always thought the name
was a metaphor, you know?

43:35.953 --> 43:37.854
Like the artistry aspect?

43:37.889 --> 43:41.121

he makes works of art...

43:41.156 --> 43:42.551

44:42.151 --> 44:44.679
How about we start with,
"How you doing?"

44:44.714 --> 44:47.385
I haven't seen you in 17 years.
Cut the shit.

44:47.420 --> 44:51.125
I know you. You keep tabs
on everything and everyone,

44:51.160 --> 44:52.225
including me.

44:56.099 --> 44:57.659
What?
You gonna tell me

44:57.694 --> 44:59.133
Niles isn't your guy?

45:01.599 --> 45:04.237
You got me. You were
in a bad place when you left.

45:04.272 --> 45:06.536
Of course I was gonna
use our resources

45:06.571 --> 45:07.636
to keep an eye on you.

45:07.671 --> 45:08.736
What father wouldn't?

45:08.771 --> 45:10.375
You got to know, Peter,

45:10.410 --> 45:13.411
I never meant for it
to go down the way it did.

45:13.446 --> 45:14.918
If I could--
Just tell me about the people

45:14.953 --> 45:16.084
who came to kill me.

45:18.957 --> 45:22.057
There's an agent
named Naomi Piasecki.

45:22.959 --> 45:24.719
She's running things.
I never worked with her,

45:24.754 --> 45:28.800
but she has a reputation
for being rather ruthless.

45:28.835 --> 45:30.395
What does she want with me?

45:30.430 --> 45:31.869
[Byrne] From what I gather,
she thinks

45:31.904 --> 45:33.167
you're in possession
of something

45:33.202 --> 45:34.564
that poses a major threat

45:34.599 --> 45:36.335
to our national security.

45:36.370 --> 45:38.205
Is that true? Are you?

45:38.240 --> 45:39.404
No.

45:42.145 --> 45:45.883
Well, if Piasecki's throwing
this much firepower at you,

45:45.918 --> 45:47.643
it must be something serious.

45:50.780 --> 45:52.417
I have another question.

45:53.453 --> 45:55.024
Fire away.

45:55.059 --> 45:56.828
I'm just happy to be with you.

45:57.963 --> 45:59.930
Who is Sophia,

45:59.965 --> 46:02.460
and why is she saying
that she's Elena's daughter?

46:04.464 --> 46:05.837
Elena's daughter?

46:06.400 --> 46:07.630
Peter...

46:08.831 --> 46:11.304
Elena couldn't have children
after the incident.

46:11.339 --> 46:13.372
Well, she looks
just like her...

46:14.441 --> 46:16.078
and she thinks I'm her father.

Do you want to do this
in the dark,

47:27.316 --> 47:29.382
or are you gonna
turn some lights on?

No idea, buddy.

48:10.392 --> 48:12.491
Oh, I think you do.

48:12.526 --> 48:14.823
See, I was up at his house,

48:14.858 --> 48:16.495
paying him a visit.

48:17.795 --> 48:20.037
He was out,
so I thought I'd come check

I'm supposedly your grandfather.

48:58.678 --> 49:01.474
Yeah. We can 23andMe

49:01.509 --> 49:02.640
Where's my mom?

49:02.675 --> 49:04.774
Who are you really,
young lady?

49:04.809 --> 49:05.907
And who are you working for?

49:05.942 --> 49:07.447
Put the gun down.

49:08.120 --> 49:09.977
Put the gun down.

49:10.012 --> 49:11.319
I just want to find my mom.

49:11.354 --> 49:13.288
Elena's your mom? Okay!

49:13.323 --> 49:15.818
When's her birthday?
What color are her eyes?

49:15.853 --> 49:18.128
What's her middle name?
Where did you live with her?

49:18.163 --> 49:20.922
What's your angle, Sophia?
If that's even your real name.

49:20.957 --> 49:22.792
And what do you want
with my son?

49:22.827 --> 49:27.632
My name is Sophia Elle Maran,
born October 23rd, 2006.

49:27.667 --> 49:31.636
My mom is Elena Tatiana Maran,
but everybody calls her El.

49:31.671 --> 49:34.111
Her birthday
is September 30th, 1980,

49:34.146 --> 49:35.970
and her eyes are brown.

49:36.005 --> 49:39.908

49:39.943 --> 49:42.746

two-bedroom apartment.

49:42.781 --> 49:45.254
She works for the CIA,
in surveillance,

49:45.289 --> 49:46.849
and was gone
most of my childhood.

49:46.884 --> 49:48.983
I stayed
at our neighbor's house,

49:49.018 --> 49:50.787
with her best friend,
Janine Whittler,

49:50.822 --> 49:53.130
and her son, Steven,
who was my first kiss.

49:54.066 --> 49:56.166
She has a tattoo
on the inside of her wrist

49:56.201 --> 49:57.959
that says "Miracle."

So if you're done
asking your stupid questions,

50:03.142 --> 50:05.505
can you shut up
and actually help?

50:07.443 --> 50:08.937
What do you want me to do?

50:08.972 --> 50:10.642
Make a call.
See what you find.

01:11:58.687 --> 01:12:01.083
I think there's more to this
than what you're telling us.

01:12:02.152 --> 01:12:03.690
I don't know shit.

01:12:04.693 --> 01:12:06.660
I just want to find out
what happened to my mom.

01:12:06.695 --> 01:12:07.826
Hmm.

01:12:09.159 --> 01:12:11.764
Let me remind you, withholding
a person's whereabouts

01:12:11.799 --> 01:12:14.668
has some
very serious consequences.

01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:19.376
You don't scare me.

01:12:21.138 --> 01:12:22.236
Don't worry.

01:12:23.404 --> 01:12:25.140
There's still time.

01:12:26.979 --> 01:12:28.451
Everyone out!

01:12:29.212 --> 01:12:31.212
Chief, that's against protocol.

01:12:31.247 --> 01:12:33.555
I don't recall
asking your opinion, Agent Kim.

01:12:44.568 --> 01:12:46.029
Now...

01:12:46.636 --> 01:12:48.097
where were we?

01:12:50.838 --> 01:12:53.872
This drive
is pretty banged up, Peter.

01:12:57.306 --> 01:12:58.206
[keys clacking]

01:13:01.178 --> 01:13:02.947
Bingo. We're in.

01:13:04.181 --> 01:13:06.016
[chiming]

01:13:08.152 --> 01:13:11.087
Peter, did you see this?
They're recruiting kids.

01:13:11.122 --> 01:13:14.255
They're stealing them, raising
them with agency parents.

01:13:14.290 --> 01:13:16.092
They're temporarily
blinding them

01:13:16.127 --> 01:13:17.863
so they over-develop
their other senses.

01:13:17.898 --> 01:13:19.227
She's turning them
into you.

01:13:19.262 --> 01:13:20.393
"She"?

01:13:20.428 --> 01:13:21.801
Naomi Piasecki.

01:13:22.606 --> 01:13:24.705
She must've gone rogue
years ago.

01:13:25.807 --> 01:13:28.368
What's going on here?
What's happening?

01:13:28.403 --> 01:13:31.437
This thing has some kind of
virus coded into it.

01:13:31.472 --> 01:13:33.274
Pull the drive!
[stammers]

01:13:33.309 --> 01:13:34.550
[Byrne] Oh, shit!

01:13:34.585 --> 01:13:35.980
[alert blaring]

01:13:36.015 --> 01:13:38.081
Goddamn it!

01:13:38.116 --> 01:13:39.412
We lost everything!

01:13:39.447 --> 01:13:42.118
Shit! We've lost
every fucking thing!

01:13:42.153 --> 01:13:44.560
We lost it! They tried
to kill you over this,

01:13:44.595 --> 01:13:46.892
and now it's... now it's...

01:13:46.927 --> 01:13:48.190
now it's gone!

01:13:49.127 --> 01:13:50.731
Peter, I'm so sorry.

01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:56.099
What are you smiling about?

01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:58.739
"Critical redundancy."

01:14:03.845 --> 01:14:04.811
What?

01:14:05.616 --> 01:14:06.747
There's a copy.

01:14:08.652 --> 01:14:11.312
Well, let's go get it!
Not yet.

01:14:11.347 --> 01:14:13.589
I owe it to Elena
to get Sophia back first.

01:14:15.956 --> 01:14:17.318
[phone chimes]

01:14:17.353 --> 01:14:19.595

[hinges creak]

01:14:35.404 --> 01:14:37.547
Mind if I borrow
a few things?

01:14:43.621 --> 01:14:45.522
[Kim]
We need that unpacked now!

01:14:46.316 --> 01:14:48.591
How we doing? Show me.

01:14:48.626 --> 01:14:50.351
Show me this.
Okay, we need more than this.

01:14:50.386 --> 01:14:52.089
I need more angles.

01:14:53.554 --> 01:14:55.026
Come on!
Let's get these visuals up!

01:14:55.061 --> 01:14:57.028
We needed them up yesterday.

01:14:57.063 --> 01:14:59.195
What was that all about?
Out of my way.

01:14:59.230 --> 01:15:00.702
She's a kid. She has rights.

01:15:00.970 --> 01:15:03.298
You cannot question a minor
without another agent.

01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:05.839
Everything she said
will be inadmissible.

01:15:05.874 --> 01:15:08.677
Our responsibility
is to stop a dangerous fugitive

01:15:08.712 --> 01:15:10.305
from killing anyone else.

01:15:11.374 --> 01:15:12.846
I'm gonna have
to call this in.

01:15:12.881 --> 01:15:14.947
I'm gonna call it in
and report it myself

01:15:14.982 --> 01:15:16.850
after the threat is neutralized!

01:15:16.885 --> 01:15:19.655
Did you even search the girl
before you put her in holding?

01:15:19.690 --> 01:15:20.953
Of course.
Really?

01:15:20.988 --> 01:15:22.724
Then what the fuck is this?

01:15:25.157 --> 01:15:26.486
Fail.

01:15:26.521 --> 01:15:27.894
[shouts]
Attention, everyone!

01:15:27.929 --> 01:15:30.028
The Painter is incoming.

01:15:30.063 --> 01:15:33.229
I need eyes on him before he
steps foot into this facility.

01:15:33.264 --> 01:15:34.736
Am I clear?

01:15:34.771 --> 01:15:36.672
Move!
[man] You heard her! Let's go!

01:15:36.707 --> 01:15:39.675
Intercept teams, into position.
The Painter is coming in hot.

01:15:39.710 --> 01:15:43.239
We are code red.
I repeat, code red.

[indistinct chatter over radios]

01:15:47.751 --> 01:15:50.510
[keys clacking rapidly]
[indistinct conversations]

01:15:52.118 --> 01:15:53.513
I'm gonna go over here.

01:15:55.286 --> 01:15:56.417
[man] You heard her!
Let's go!

01:15:57.453 --> 01:15:59.090
[both groan]

01:15:59.392 --> 01:16:01.554
[Kim] Southwest corner. I need
teams on the southwest corner!

01:16:01.589 --> 01:16:03.292
We are empty over there!

01:16:04.702 --> 01:16:06.735
North is good.
We need the west side, though.

01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:07.670
West side, please.

01:16:11.632 --> 01:16:15.040
All right. Let's go! Let's go!
Come on! Move it!

01:16:15.075 --> 01:16:17.977
Southwest corner! We need teams
on the southwest corner!

Move.

[man] More down! Where is he?

01:17:22.373 --> 01:17:23.944
Anyone got eyes on him?

01:18:06.252 --> 01:18:08.824
We need to move you to
a more secure location, Sophia.

[gunfire in distance]
Why are you helping me?

01:18:10.828 --> 01:18:13.422
The situation
has gotten out of control.

01:18:15.327 --> 01:18:16.997
It is too dangerous
for you here.

01:18:17.032 --> 01:18:19.769
What about my dad?
Is he okay?

01:18:25.172 --> 01:18:26.908
We need to go now.

01:18:27.735 --> 01:18:29.174

01:18:41.958 --> 01:18:43.089
There's a weapon down here.

01:18:46.457 --> 01:18:48.490

01:19:41.886 --> 01:19:43.919
And where do you think
you're going?

01:19:55.031 --> 01:19:56.459
Come with me.

01:20:47.545 --> 01:20:48.643
I'll take it from here.

[ears ringing]
[Kim] I can't let you do that.

01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:54.990
You're disregarding
a direct order from a superior.

01:20:55.025 --> 01:20:56.816
Stand the fuck down, Agent Kim.

01:20:56.851 --> 01:20:59.390
It's over, Piasecki!
This whole operation is over.

01:20:59.425 --> 01:21:00.886
I am taking her in, and we can--

[pistol racks]
Move.

01:21:27.255 --> 01:21:28.221
Come on, kid. Move.

01:21:31.787 --> 01:21:32.962
Let her go.

[Sophia whispers] Dad.

01:21:49.343 --> 01:21:51.871
[imitates gunshot] Really?
Come on. You're gonna shoot me?

01:21:51.906 --> 01:21:54.412
That's so boring.
Let's play a game.

01:21:54.447 --> 01:21:56.678
Who is the better intern?

01:21:56.713 --> 01:21:58.284
Patient Zero...

01:21:58.319 --> 01:21:59.780
or the new-and-improved?

01:21:59.815 --> 01:22:01.386
I'm not here
for your milestones.

01:22:01.421 --> 01:22:02.717
[rapid gunfire]

01:22:07.922 --> 01:22:10.725
Really? You're gonna deprive me

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:13.893
of the opportunity to prove
that I'm better than you?

01:22:13.928 --> 01:22:17.006
That's... No, that's...
That's fair. That makes sense.

01:22:18.174 --> 01:22:20.273

01:22:39.426 --> 01:22:40.788
I don't want to do this, kid.

01:22:40.823 --> 01:22:42.559
These people, they...

01:22:42.594 --> 01:22:46.233
kidnapped you, tortured you,
brainwashed you,

01:22:46.268 --> 01:22:49.401
all to make you something
you were never supposed to be.

01:22:49.436 --> 01:22:50.798
Me.

01:22:53.836 --> 01:22:55.374
What's your real name?

01:22:56.542 --> 01:22:59.807
It's... It's Daniel.

01:22:59.842 --> 01:23:02.183
Well, it doesn't have
to go down like this, Daniel.

01:23:02.218 --> 01:23:04.152
You can go have a whole life.

01:23:04.187 --> 01:23:05.945
Fall in love, have kids.

01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.156
But you got to make
that choice for yourself.

01:23:08.191 --> 01:23:09.652
That does sound nice.

01:23:10.457 --> 01:23:12.028
[chuckles]

01:23:13.427 --> 01:23:15.130
But I like who I am.

01:23:15.957 --> 01:23:17.858
So enough with the pity party.

01:23:17.893 --> 01:23:19.596
And don't feel sorry for me.

01:23:19.631 --> 01:23:22.368
Sure, the whole forced-blindness
thing kind of sucked,

01:23:22.403 --> 01:23:24.205
but it made me special.

01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:25.536
And for the record,

01:23:25.571 --> 01:23:28.440
they didn't force me
to be like you.

01:23:28.475 --> 01:23:29.672
[neck cracks]

01:23:30.345 --> 01:23:31.509

01:24:42.219 --> 01:24:45.616
You know, Elena had
more fight in her than you do.

She really
stuck her neck out there.

Dad, please!

01:25:32.797 --> 01:25:34.599

[Naomi] What took you so long?

01:26:05.863 --> 01:26:09.238
I've been waiting a long time
to meet you, Painter.

[suspenseful music plays]

01:26:14.201 --> 01:26:17.136
You must be Naomi Piasecki.

01:26:17.171 --> 01:26:19.974
Hmm. Byrne told you about me?

01:26:21.043 --> 01:26:22.779
He said you were ruthless.

01:26:22.814 --> 01:26:24.044
[laughing]

01:26:24.079 --> 01:26:26.552
I'm a little more than that.

01:26:26.587 --> 01:26:29.819
God, Byrne would never
shut up about you.

01:26:29.854 --> 01:26:32.492
All those years I worked
for him, he'd go on and on,

01:26:32.527 --> 01:26:34.296
how you were the best
that ever was,

01:26:34.331 --> 01:26:35.924
and the best he ever saw.

01:26:35.959 --> 01:26:38.234
Jesus Christ,
it made me want to puke.

01:26:45.903 --> 01:26:47.199
What, you think
you're the only one

01:26:47.234 --> 01:26:48.673
that knows how
to dodge a bullet?

01:26:49.577 --> 01:26:50.972
You're an Intern.

01:26:51.007 --> 01:26:54.547
I'm the Head Intern, see?

01:26:54.582 --> 01:26:57.143
They used to call me Mimic.
Now they call me the boss.

[Sophia panting] Dad!

01:27:07.496 --> 01:27:09.661
Toss the weapon, Peter.

Game's over.

01:27:21.906 --> 01:27:23.477
You okay?

01:27:26.207 --> 01:27:27.811

Told you I had your six, son.

01:27:46.161 --> 01:27:47.303
What are you doing, Peter?

01:27:49.296 --> 01:27:51.505
Piasecki isn't
running The Internship.

01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:53.408
She works for you.

01:27:53.443 --> 01:27:56.004
The Internship's yours.
It's always been yours.

01:27:56.039 --> 01:27:58.204
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

01:27:58.239 --> 01:28:00.712
That's absurd, Peter.
Don't lie to me!

01:28:00.747 --> 01:28:02.417
You told me
you never worked with her,

01:28:02.452 --> 01:28:04.111
but she sure seems
to know you.

01:28:04.146 --> 01:28:06.619
She's an Intern.
She didn't start the program.

01:28:06.654 --> 01:28:08.918
She couldn't have!
And you think it was me?

01:28:08.953 --> 01:28:11.657
Who else could it be?
You must've been training her

01:28:11.692 --> 01:28:14.121
around the time I started
to kill people for the CIA.

01:28:14.156 --> 01:28:16.222
You saw what I'd become.

01:28:16.257 --> 01:28:18.026
You figured
you could do it again.

01:28:18.061 --> 01:28:20.600
Okay. You got me.

01:28:21.537 --> 01:28:23.669
There's too much oversight here

01:28:23.704 --> 01:28:25.671
for me to stay on any further.

01:28:25.706 --> 01:28:28.036
I'm going to make you
section chief,

01:28:28.071 --> 01:28:29.807
and I'm going to retire

01:28:30.645 --> 01:28:32.304

from the outside.

I didn't want it
to come to this, Peter.

01:28:46.287 --> 01:28:48.122
I wanted you out of this.
"Out of this"?

01:28:48.157 --> 01:28:49.662
She's been trying to kill me
since this started.

01:28:49.697 --> 01:28:51.191
That's pretty fuckin' far
from "out."

01:28:51.226 --> 01:28:52.797
You would've been dead
if it was up to me.

Will you shut up?

been a little overzealous.

01:28:57.133 --> 01:28:58.638
I apologize.

01:28:58.673 --> 01:29:00.838
I need the location
of that backup, Peter.

01:29:00.873 --> 01:29:03.170
Sophia and I will take
a nice little drive,

01:29:03.205 --> 01:29:06.041
and once it's in my hands,
you'll get her back.

01:29:06.076 --> 01:29:08.516
You're stealing
and torturing children.

01:29:08.551 --> 01:29:10.617
I'm doing what's necessary!

01:29:10.652 --> 01:29:13.147
You think our enemies
aren't doing the same and worse?

I am protecting
our nation, Peter,

so people can
sleep peacefully at night.

Nothing more.

Oh, Peter.

to be my legacy.

to listen to him, Sophia.

than the truth?

Yes, he is your father,

01:29:52.529 --> 01:29:54.826
No. You don't.

You see? Internship works!

01:30:07.005 --> 01:30:09.368
And you were the prototype,
the catalyst

01:30:09.403 --> 01:30:12.272
for the entire program,
and you are magnificent, Peter.

You surpassed
every expectation.

But did you really think

01:30:15.915 --> 01:30:17.882
that I was gonna
rely on just one man,

is the love that I had
