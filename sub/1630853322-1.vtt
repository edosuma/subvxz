00:40.960 --> 00:42.000
Ben, what is that?

00:43.080 --> 00:45.600
It's nothing. Come here.
It's nothing.

00:47.240 --> 00:51.079
What? What is that?
It's nothing.

00:51.080 --> 00:54.800
WOMAN SCREAMS

01:14.240 --> 01:16.160
POLICE RADIO CHATTER

01:21.680 --> 01:23.919
Sorry, madam. Police. This is a...

01:23.920 --> 01:25.999
Grace, is it? You called it in?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.919
Yeah. Roy.

01:27.920 --> 01:31.920
Cleo Morey - I'm the on-call Senior
Anatomical Pathology Technician.

01:32.920 --> 01:35.999
You're new.
To you.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.239
What? I'm new to you.
Oh, right, yeah, sorry,

01:38.240 --> 01:41.079
that's what I...
That's why I hadn't...

01:41.080 --> 01:42.879
I've been at the mortuary
for two months.

01:42.880 --> 01:44.719
Right. Have you? Right.

01:44.720 --> 01:47.479
You won't know my colleague, Darren,
either. He is new.

01:47.480 --> 01:49.119
He's been with us
less than a fortnight.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.279
We're cleared to take over from here

01:51.280 --> 01:53.399
if you need to liaise
with your people.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.200
Er, your jacket?

01:56.920 --> 01:58.479
Yeah.
Er...

01:58.480 --> 02:01.919
I know it is,
it matches your bottoms.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.679
The question was,
would you like it back? Oh, right.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.079
HE CHUCKLES

02:06.080 --> 02:09.399
Er... Mm... Probably not.

02:09.400 --> 02:12.120
Yeah.
OK, I'll, er...

02:15.920 --> 02:20.479
It was a...
it was a kind thing to do.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.560
Covering her.

02:29.840 --> 02:31.240
Morning.
Morning.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.080
SHE GASPS

03:30.840 --> 03:34.079
DS Grace, do you have a statement?
DS Grace... is it a murder?

03:34.080 --> 03:36.359
Is it a murder, DS Grace?
Do you have you any comments?

03:36.360 --> 03:37.480
Have you got any leads yet?

03:42.920 --> 03:45.079
Mr Bishop?
Yeah.

03:45.080 --> 03:47.599
Detective Sergeant Potting.
East Sussex CID.

03:47.600 --> 03:51.679
This is my colleague, DC Nicholl.
Can we have a word, please?

03:51.680 --> 03:54.359
I'm halfway through
a golf tournament. Can't it wait?

03:54.360 --> 03:56.520
No. Not really.

04:01.960 --> 04:05.919
Oh, my God. Hol?
There's been a development.

04:05.920 --> 04:08.599
You know I've been getting
a bit flirty-flirty

04:08.600 --> 04:09.999
with you-know-who?

04:10.000 --> 04:14.399
So, he just turned up
out of the blue last night -

04:14.400 --> 04:19.119
really late - and, erm,
it all went a bit Christian Grey.

04:19.120 --> 04:22.919
I was wondering... Mr Bishop,
if you could give me an account

04:22.920 --> 04:24.880
of your movements
over the last 24 hours.

04:26.640 --> 04:30.199
All right.
Er, yesterday, I was at my office.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.119
I live in London through the week.

04:32.120 --> 04:33.719
I had supper
with my financial adviser,

04:33.720 --> 04:35.959
then went back to my flat
and went to bed.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.439
I left around half-six this morning
and drove down here.

04:38.440 --> 04:39.960
Look, what is this about?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.800
When did you last see your wife,
Mr Bishop?

04:44.880 --> 04:48.079
No, no sign of forced entry
according to CSI.

04:48.080 --> 04:51.959
I want all CCTV footage
from all surveillance cameras

04:51.960 --> 04:53.599
within a two-mile radius,

04:53.600 --> 04:56.080
and all routes in and out
of Brighton.

04:57.320 --> 05:00.279
Yeah, the Home Office pathologist
is on the way.

05:00.280 --> 05:01.840
OK, I'll be in touch.

05:33.840 --> 05:36.159
No sign of any blowfly activity.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.919
They're pretty quick off the mark.
Recent, then.

05:38.920 --> 05:40.719
Er, pathologist's call -

05:40.720 --> 05:42.719
less than 24 would be
my best estimate.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.199
Most likely in the small hours.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.999
Oh, we'll need the lab
to confirm this,

05:46.000 --> 05:49.759
but, erm, UV showed up traces
of sexual activity.

05:49.760 --> 05:52.600
Ties are knotted
in a Somerville bowline.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.880
Did you know blowflies can smell
death from up to five miles away?

05:58.920 --> 06:00.760
You don't say.

06:17.640 --> 06:20.880
You've heard of them, presumably?
Katya and Kit Bishop.

06:22.680 --> 06:25.639
Brighton and Hove's golden couple,
they're in all the magazines.

06:25.640 --> 06:28.999
Oh. Well, they don't go big
on lifestyle in Carp Monthly.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.239
He's International
Rostering Solutions.

06:32.240 --> 06:37.039
Software. Offices around the world.
He's also a dedicated petrol head.

06:37.040 --> 06:40.159
Races sports cars for a hobby.
And Mrs Bishop?

06:40.160 --> 06:41.840
Socialite.
Oh.

06:43.600 --> 06:46.200
They're personal friends of
the Police and Crime Commissioner.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.639
They raise a lot of money
for charitable causes.

06:49.640 --> 06:52.360
So the Chief Constable is keen
that we don't let the grass grow.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.959
"Without fear or favour."

06:56.960 --> 06:58.679
That-that is still the oath,
isn't it...?

06:58.680 --> 07:01.119
Have you got enough officers
on the team for this one,

07:01.120 --> 07:02.920
with DC Boutwood
still out of the game?

07:04.200 --> 07:06.079
Should do, yeah. Glenn's back today.

07:06.080 --> 07:08.200
If his counsellor signs him off -
fingers crossed.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.920
Having your playmate back
might put a spring in your step.

07:30.960 --> 07:33.039
Quite an experience getting shot?

07:33.040 --> 07:38.399
Yeah, well, it's, er..
not one I'm keen to repeat.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.999
Once is enough for any lifetime, eh?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.719
MEN'S SHOUTS ECHOING

07:42.720 --> 07:44.719
GUNFIRE,
YELLING

07:44.720 --> 07:46.720
MAN: 'Urgent medical assistance
required.'

07:49.040 --> 07:50.519
'How are you feeling?'

07:50.520 --> 07:53.439
'Yeah. Yeah, I'm great.
I'm raring to go, you know.'

07:53.440 --> 07:55.799
Can't wait to get back to work.

07:55.800 --> 07:58.879
I mean, compared to my colleague,
DC Boutwood,

07:58.880 --> 08:00.240
Emma-Jane...

08:01.360 --> 08:03.639
..yeah, I was, er... I was lucky.

08:03.640 --> 08:06.479
This isn't about her.
This is about you.

08:06.480 --> 08:09.439
It's understandable to want
to relativise, Glenn,

08:09.440 --> 08:12.359
but it can also become a way
of distancing oneself

08:12.360 --> 08:15.159
from the reality of what happened.
Trust me...

08:15.160 --> 08:19.480
I'm as close to the reality
of what happened as it gets.

08:20.480 --> 08:25.240
I've done the physio. OK? I'm here.
I've read the pamphlets. I've...

08:28.840 --> 08:31.879
I've had a good cry with my wife.

08:31.880 --> 08:36.240
'I've hugged the kids. I've done
everything on that tick list.

08:37.360 --> 08:41.480
'But now... I just want
to get back to work.'

08:59.800 --> 09:01.319
What about this one?

09:01.320 --> 09:03.520
Nah, that's not what he's after,
it's not an MG.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.200
PHONE VIBRATING

09:22.720 --> 09:26.399
SOPHIE: 'Morning.'
Sorry. It's... It's not a good time.

09:26.400 --> 09:30.280
Kit, what is it? What's happened?
'It's, erm...'

09:31.280 --> 09:34.639
I'm-I'm just about to go
into a police station.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.280
'It's Katya, she's, erm...'

09:38.240 --> 09:40.839
She's-she's dead.
What?

09:40.840 --> 09:42.839
'How? When?'

09:42.840 --> 09:45.799
I don't know. But they keep
asking me where I was last night.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.120
So, tell them you were at mine.

09:50.080 --> 09:53.719
That's very sweet of you, but
I really don't wanna involve you.

09:53.720 --> 09:56.319
Kit...
Look, Soph, I can't talk now.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.120
I have to go in.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.599
So, how did Mr Bishop seem?

10:08.600 --> 10:11.999
Like a bloke who's told
his wife's been murdered.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.559
You see, it's insight like that
that makes me glad I asked you

10:14.560 --> 10:17.199
to join the team full-time, Norman.
Not the bubbly personality?

10:17.200 --> 10:21.359
What can I tell you?
Look, he wasn't bawling.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.999
Quite buttoned down, I'd say.
It could be shock.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.039
Oh, it could. OR...

10:26.040 --> 10:29.000
he could be a stone-cold killer
with something to hide.

10:40.840 --> 10:44.079
Detective Superintendent Roy Grace,
Mr Bishop.

10:44.080 --> 10:47.760
I'm the Senior Investigating Officer
for this... incident.

10:49.760 --> 10:51.279
My sincere condolences.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.839
It would be very helpful
if you could help us

10:53.840 --> 10:56.159
with some background questions.

10:56.160 --> 10:58.119
I've already answered
a lot of questions.

10:58.120 --> 11:01.040
I appreciate that. And I'll try
and keep this as brief as possible.

11:03.520 --> 11:05.799
How long have you been married,
Mr Bishop?

11:05.800 --> 11:08.559
Er... Five years, April just gone.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.600
It was a happy marriage?

11:12.120 --> 11:13.440
Yes.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.319
Where did you sleep last night?

11:17.320 --> 11:19.160
At my flat, in London.

11:20.560 --> 11:23.759
Can anyone vouch for that?
The concierge, Oliver, I suppose.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.839
And when did you see him?

11:25.840 --> 11:28.519
Last night, around seven,
when I came back from the office.

11:28.520 --> 11:30.799
And again first thing this morning,
around half-six.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.639
He helped me load my clubs
into the car.

11:32.640 --> 11:35.319
Can anyone vouch for your
whereabouts between seven last night

11:35.320 --> 11:36.679
and half-six this morning?

11:36.680 --> 11:38.559
I had dinner
with my financial adviser

11:38.560 --> 11:41.479
at a restaurant in Piccadilly.
That wound up around nine-thirty.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.839
Would you mind telling me
what happened AFTER your dinner?

11:43.840 --> 11:46.159
I think I would mind, actually,
if it's all the same to you.

11:46.160 --> 11:48.839
I have been incredibly patient,

11:48.840 --> 11:51.360
but I've answered all the questions
I'm going to for now.

11:52.480 --> 11:54.280
I want to see my wife.

11:56.680 --> 12:00.160
It really would be in your best
interest to make that happen.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.079
'I want to see my wife.

12:04.080 --> 12:08.479
'It really would be in your best
interest to make that happen.'

12:08.480 --> 12:11.279
Nice little flash of temper
at the death there.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.800
And a threat to boot.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.719
Whey! Look who it isn't!

12:16.720 --> 12:19.079
Aye-aye, big man.
You guys!

12:19.080 --> 12:21.440
Hey, congrats on the baby, Nick.
Thanking you.

12:23.480 --> 12:27.079
You picked your morning.
So I hear. Right, so did he do it?

12:27.080 --> 12:29.399
Well, he didn't ask for a lawyer.

12:29.400 --> 12:32.600
But did he kill his wife?
I don't know.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.960
I'll let you get settled in.
And my wife?

12:58.600 --> 13:00.079
I was told I'd be able to see her.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.720
You'll be able to see her
when the postmortem's concluded.

13:09.960 --> 13:11.560
DOOR CLOSES

13:12.840 --> 13:15.479
Cause of death is asphyxia.

13:15.480 --> 13:18.199
Katya Bishop was strangled
with a ligature around her neck

13:18.200 --> 13:19.959
of either thin cord or wire.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.839
There are also signs
sexual intercourse had taken place

13:22.840 --> 13:24.639
at some point close to death.

13:24.640 --> 13:28.119
What is strange is that
there are no marks on her body.

13:28.120 --> 13:30.519
Well, you would've thought
if she resisted her assailant,

13:30.520 --> 13:33.039
there'd be scratches or bruises,
wouldn't you? Mm-hmm.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.360
So it could be someone she knew.

13:50.240 --> 13:52.879
You've not been here very long,
Miss Morey tells me.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.359
Cle?

13:54.360 --> 13:56.519
No. That's right.
How're you finding it?

13:56.520 --> 13:58.800
I like the variety.
Oh, yeah.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.919
Where were you before?
Hickson's Abattoir - slaughterman.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.200
Oh.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.960
It's very thoughtful, what you do.

14:30.960 --> 14:33.279
Considerate. The care you take.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.480
I'm sure it means a lot.
To the families.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.839
It's nice if it does.

14:39.840 --> 14:43.120
But... it's for her, really.

14:45.240 --> 14:49.840
Maybe... give back
some of what was taken.

15:08.960 --> 15:12.600
Can you give us a minute?
I'd like to be alone with my wife.

15:17.200 --> 15:20.000
DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS

15:28.360 --> 15:30.280
HE SOBS

15:31.920 --> 15:32.960
He's hurting.

15:34.880 --> 15:36.440
Or he knows we're watching.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.720
PHONE VIBRATING

15:54.040 --> 15:56.399
Soph? I'm under the drier.
What's going on?

15:56.400 --> 15:57.719
You haven't seen the news?

15:57.720 --> 15:59.719
No.
'It's Kit.'

15:59.720 --> 16:02.239
They're saying his wife's
been killed.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.400
'Murdered.'

16:05.520 --> 16:08.959
Keep a close eye and a tight rein.
You're the good cop.

16:08.960 --> 16:11.799
Let him trust you.
You think he did it?

16:11.800 --> 16:15.199
I think any spouse in a murder case
is bound to be a person

16:15.200 --> 16:18.839
of significant interest,
and he's no different.

16:18.840 --> 16:20.720
Detective Superintendent?

16:22.440 --> 16:23.799
Roy, Miss Morey.

16:23.800 --> 16:28.920
Cleo. Sorry, erm, I almost forgot -
your tracksuit top.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.479
I'll, er...

16:32.480 --> 16:33.999
It's perfectly clean.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.920
I put it through the washer-drier
we have here.

16:36.920 --> 16:39.399
Wow, that's-that's...
that's really very kind of you.

16:39.400 --> 16:42.719
You didn't need to do that.
No. Well, it's done now.

16:42.720 --> 16:45.119
Erm, I'll understand
if you don't want it.

16:45.120 --> 16:49.039
Some people are squeamish.
No. No. I'm very grateful.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.519
Thank you. You'll have to be careful

16:50.520 --> 16:54.839
I don't start bringing all
my laundry to the... mortuary.

16:54.840 --> 16:57.399
THEY CHUCKLE

16:57.400 --> 17:00.919
Erm, any news on the body
from the water?

17:00.920 --> 17:03.439
The unknown female? No.
No distinguishing features

17:03.440 --> 17:06.239
and decomposition
rules out fingerprints.

17:06.240 --> 17:10.079
Dental records? Her jaw's intact,
so we'll send those out tomorrow

17:10.080 --> 17:12.679
along with her measurements,
description and photographs

17:12.680 --> 17:15.279
to the Missing Persons Helpline.
No idea as to the cause?

17:15.280 --> 17:17.799
No. No obvious suspicious injuries.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.759
So we're waiting on
the consultant pathologist

17:19.760 --> 17:21.839
to perform a postmortem.

17:21.840 --> 17:26.599
Well, erm, thanks again for this.
I'll, er...

17:26.600 --> 17:29.560
Yeah, I'll see you again, I'm sure.
Yeah.

17:35.400 --> 17:38.879
What's that about?
Unknown female from the beach.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.480
No, THAT.

17:42.200 --> 17:45.520
Oh, er... tracksuit top.

17:51.280 --> 17:54.479
What? It's not like that.

17:54.480 --> 17:57.519
Like what?
Whatever it is that you're thinking.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.359
Hmm. What am I thinking?

17:59.360 --> 18:02.119
That it's... something.

18:02.120 --> 18:04.039
And why shouldn't it be?

18:04.040 --> 18:07.839
Roy, you're allowed to feel
something for another human being.

18:07.840 --> 18:09.640
If you need permission...

18:11.480 --> 18:14.560
You can't be faithful to a ghost.

18:19.840 --> 18:22.759
REPORTER: 'The body was found this
morning by a domestic cleaner

18:22.760 --> 18:25.199
'at the home of Kit
and Katya Bishop,

18:25.200 --> 18:28.920
'a young and popular couple at the
heart of Brighton's social scene.'

'Hello, you've reached Kit Bishop.
I can't take your call.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.519
'Please leave a message.'
BEEP

19:09.520 --> 19:12.719
Mr Bishop, this is
Detective Superintendent Grace.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.920
Please call me as soon
as you get this message.

19:16.320 --> 19:18.919
Did he have any luggage?
Overnight bag and a laptop.

19:18.920 --> 19:21.159
I've left the FLO on site
in case he comes back

19:21.160 --> 19:23.919
and notified the scene guard
at the family home.

19:23.920 --> 19:26.519
Check with local taxis,
see if anyone's picked up a man

19:26.520 --> 19:29.599
matching Bishop's description
in the vicinity of the hotel

19:29.600 --> 19:32.680
between 5:20, 5:30 this afternoon.

19:33.800 --> 19:38.039
Norman, where are we with, erm,
CSI from the Bishops' house?

19:38.040 --> 19:41.999
Two computers taken for analysis.
Landline recordings requisitioned,

19:42.000 --> 19:45.119
that's the same with the mobile
phone records for both him and her.

19:45.120 --> 19:48.879
Right. We've got one
mobile phone message recovered.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.399
It's a withheld number.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.880
Ten past 11 yesterday morning.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.959
Have a listen.
'I'll see you later.'

19:56.960 --> 19:59.479
Is that Bishop?
It doesn't sound like him.

19:59.480 --> 20:01.079
I've been on to the phone company,

20:01.080 --> 20:03.079
they're going to get me the records
soon as.

20:03.080 --> 20:05.519
But we've also got
a car parking ticket

20:05.520 --> 20:07.439
found in the footwell of her motor.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.159
Now, it was bought
at 11 minutes past five...

20:10.160 --> 20:12.039
PHONE RINGS
..Thursday afternoon,

20:12.040 --> 20:14.959
in Salvesen Street, Lewes.
Pursuing enquiries.

20:14.960 --> 20:18.639
And that's the same
with a petrol receipt from a garage

20:18.640 --> 20:21.999
on the A27 just outside of Lewes.
CCTV?

20:22.000 --> 20:24.279
There's only one camera
that covers the forecourt.

20:24.280 --> 20:26.879
We should have that tomorrow.
I'm gonna pop over later,

20:26.880 --> 20:29.199
speak to the attendant.
See if they said anything.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.959
When do we expect the results
from the DNA recovered

20:31.960 --> 20:34.959
from the sheets and the postmortem?
Monday at the earliest.

20:34.960 --> 20:39.039
Sorry, Roy.
This just in - 10:47 last night,

20:39.040 --> 20:42.439
M23 just outside Gatwick -
ANPR camera picks up the plate

20:42.440 --> 20:47.039
of a Jaguar registered to Kit
Bishop, heading towards Brighton.

20:47.040 --> 20:49.639
Didn't he say he never left London?
Well, he could've come down,

20:49.640 --> 20:53.159
done the nasty, and gone back.
Can we plot the route?

20:53.160 --> 20:57.319
See, once it's past Crawley, the car
just disappears off the grid.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.079
What d'you mean,
disappears off the grid?

20:59.080 --> 21:03.159
It's not clocked again.
So maybe he travels down via B-roads

21:03.160 --> 21:05.599
and doubles back to avoid
his movements being picked up.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.759
Anything within two miles
of the Bishops' house?

21:07.760 --> 21:09.319
No. The Jag, no.

21:09.320 --> 21:12.839
What about on the Northbound M23,
heading back to London?

21:12.840 --> 21:15.880
Nope.
It just disappears into thin air.

22:30.120 --> 22:32.439
Kit Bishop was picked up by taxi

22:32.440 --> 22:34.879
at the rear of the Holiday Inn
two hours ago.

22:34.880 --> 22:38.199
Destination - Hotel du Vin.
Let's go.

22:38.200 --> 22:39.840
Thanks, Bella.

23:17.760 --> 23:19.080
Who's there?

23:21.240 --> 23:22.640
Who is that?

23:30.640 --> 23:34.519
Oh, it's you!
Jeez, you gave me a fright.

23:34.520 --> 23:36.319
How d'you get in?

23:36.320 --> 23:41.239
Oh, the door was on the latch.
Oh, erm...

23:41.240 --> 23:43.919
So what was all that about today?

23:43.920 --> 23:47.639
I don't need protecting from
the police, Kit. I'm WITH you.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.400
You've got to tell them about us.

23:50.560 --> 23:53.599
If you were here last night,
you couldn't have been there, right?

23:53.600 --> 23:55.080
Sure.

23:56.840 --> 24:00.600
You going somewhere?
I've, er, got a party this evening.

24:02.560 --> 24:03.919
Why?

24:03.920 --> 24:06.840
I... I thought we might...

24:09.040 --> 24:10.720
..pick up from where we left off.

24:13.200 --> 24:15.720
Someone abandoned that van
last night. OK, I'll take a look.

24:25.760 --> 24:28.040
Oi. That's it, innit?

24:34.440 --> 24:36.079
Bingo.

24:36.080 --> 24:38.640
Yeah, we still need to get
that other one, though. The MG.

24:46.440 --> 24:47.800
Take that.

24:59.200 --> 25:01.320
ENGINE STARTS

25:32.520 --> 25:34.760
I drove down as soon as I heard.

25:42.280 --> 25:45.079
Why didn't you call me?
Shock, I suppose.

25:45.080 --> 25:48.080
The police dragging me around
from one place to another.

25:49.920 --> 25:52.200
The identification. It's, erm...

25:54.640 --> 25:56.000
It's been a day.

25:58.560 --> 26:01.519
How are you holding up?
I don't know.

26:01.520 --> 26:04.079
The police want me to stay local.

26:04.080 --> 26:07.079
They've put me in
this wretched hotel.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.639
Well, you're not staying there.

26:08.640 --> 26:11.639
We've got a suite of rooms on the
top floor for clients and partners.

26:11.640 --> 26:14.199
Thanks, but I'd better do
what they ask.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.959
That is the last thing
that you'd better do.

26:16.960 --> 26:18.959
You're staying here
under my care and protection

26:18.960 --> 26:20.560
until you are allowed to go home.
Yes!

26:23.720 --> 26:25.239
Thanks.

26:25.240 --> 26:27.999
Do they have any idea who did it?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.879
The way they're treating me, I think
they're convinced that I did it.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.799
Uh-uh. Immediate family and friends
are always suspects

26:33.800 --> 26:35.560
in any murder inquiry.
It's not personal.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.199
I swear to God, Bobbie,
they've got me scared half to death.

26:39.200 --> 26:42.399
I know. But I'm here now.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.160
DANCE MUSIC PLAYS

26:53.600 --> 26:56.319
I know there's making an entrance,
honey, but listen,

26:56.320 --> 26:58.640
after what you told me today,
I'm worried about you.

27:00.160 --> 27:02.960
If I don't hear from you in 15,
I'm coming round, yeah?

27:08.840 --> 27:11.800
FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING

27:20.160 --> 27:22.440
Ah, I thought I'd find you here.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.080
Yeah. I've, er...

27:26.600 --> 27:28.799
..missed the view.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.240
How are you?

27:32.200 --> 27:33.240
Good.

27:36.440 --> 27:37.799
Never better.

27:37.800 --> 27:39.759
Really.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.920
I'm in the shape of my life.

27:43.520 --> 27:47.999
But... there's only so much cash
a man can watch people find

27:48.000 --> 27:51.639
in the attic before a major incident
gets declared.

27:51.640 --> 27:53.439
HE CHUCKLES

27:53.440 --> 27:56.640
Yeah, Ari said you'd started to be
insufferable around the house.

27:58.200 --> 28:01.359
When did you talk to Ari?
Er... we talk.

28:01.360 --> 28:03.239
We have someone we love in common.

28:03.240 --> 28:06.639
He can be a bit reckless sometimes,
but we don't wanna be without him.

28:06.640 --> 28:08.959
That was just bad luck.
I know.

28:08.960 --> 28:12.999
But I don't want any more of it.
Not as far as you're concerned.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.959
So, no more heroics, please.
Not after last time.

28:17.960 --> 28:21.999
Just... ease yourself
back in gently.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.919
LAUGHING: Sod that!

28:23.920 --> 28:28.079
Roy, I've been stuck on that bench
for months.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.480
OK? I'm sick of...
PHONE VIBRATING

28:32.800 --> 28:34.519
Grace.

28:34.520 --> 28:36.519
Yup.

28:36.520 --> 28:38.280
Understood.

28:39.400 --> 28:43.039
Bishop's just walked into
the front office. He's lawyered up.

28:43.040 --> 28:44.560
Let me have a go at him.

28:47.400 --> 28:51.119
We're curious, Mr Bishop,
as to why you checked out

28:51.120 --> 28:54.439
of the Holiday Inn
and went to the Hotel du Vin.

28:54.440 --> 28:56.599
You care to explain your reasons?

28:56.600 --> 29:01.159
My reasons? My reasons are that
you told me to move there.

29:01.160 --> 29:03.599
One of you anyway, the police.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.599
The room phone rang around 5:30.

29:05.600 --> 29:08.199
The guy said the place
was being staked out by journos

29:08.200 --> 29:10.880
and you were moving me.
Did he give you his name?

29:12.200 --> 29:13.480
Er...

29:14.600 --> 29:16.279
Canning. DS Canning.

29:16.280 --> 29:19.039
He said that I should take
the fire escape stairs,

29:19.040 --> 29:21.520
and there'd be a cab waiting outside
the back entrance.

29:24.960 --> 29:27.599
After you checked in
to the Hotel du Vin,

29:27.600 --> 29:29.159
where did you go?

29:29.160 --> 29:30.959
Just went for a walk
along the front.

29:30.960 --> 29:33.039
Needed to get some air,
clear my head.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.800
Where have you been up until now?

29:35.960 --> 29:37.519
I had a drink in a bar

29:37.520 --> 29:39.680
and then I went
to Ms Vernon's office.

29:40.960 --> 29:43.159
So...

29:43.160 --> 29:45.240
is there any news?
I'm afraid not.

29:46.720 --> 29:48.159
Do you have any enemies?

29:48.160 --> 29:51.119
Anybody that might want to do harm
to you or your wife?

29:51.120 --> 29:52.759
Men of Mr Bishop's
wealth and profile

29:52.760 --> 29:55.079
invariably attract a legion
of enemies, as you call them.

29:55.080 --> 29:56.559
What would you call them, Ms Vernon?

29:56.560 --> 29:58.679
Free-range disturbed,
for the most part.

29:58.680 --> 30:01.159
And these days, that's almost anyone
with access to a screen

30:01.160 --> 30:04.519
and a social media account -
weirdos, beggars, critics.

30:04.520 --> 30:06.599
Long-lost relatives who aren't.

30:06.600 --> 30:08.719
Chancers. Would-be blackmailers.
Fantasists.

30:08.720 --> 30:10.879
We've a department dedicated
to keeping them at bay.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.959
Threats?
Oh, almost daily.

30:12.960 --> 30:14.999
A cease and desist
usually pulls them up short,

30:15.000 --> 30:17.559
but the more persistently deranged,
we pass on to the Met.

30:17.560 --> 30:20.679
It would be useful if we could see
anything you've received like that

30:20.680 --> 30:25.399
over the past, say, five years.
I'll see what I can do about that.

30:25.400 --> 30:30.199
Now, for the record, if you have
any further questions for my client,

30:30.200 --> 30:32.799
I would like them referred
to the office of my firm,

30:32.800 --> 30:36.479
which is where he shall be staying
for the time being.

30:36.480 --> 30:39.559
Today has come as a terrible shock,
it's been a real ordeal for him.

30:39.560 --> 30:40.960
PHONE VIBRATING

30:45.120 --> 30:48.920
POLICE SIREN,
POLICE RADIO CHATTER

30:54.000 --> 30:57.679
She called me this afternoon
in a pretty bad way.

30:57.680 --> 31:01.559
There's this guy that she's
been into for a while. Kit.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.319
Soph said that his wife
had been murdered.

31:04.320 --> 31:08.679
Kit Bishop?
Yeah. Yeah, that's him.

31:08.680 --> 31:10.999
He was freaking that the police
thought that he'd done it.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.479
But Soph said that he couldn't have.
How's that?

31:13.480 --> 31:16.959
Cos he was with her last night.
What, here?

31:16.960 --> 31:18.280
Yeah.

31:19.800 --> 31:24.279
Soph said that... that he just
turned up out the blue

31:24.280 --> 31:26.360
and things got a bit...

31:28.800 --> 31:31.680
"A little light bondage"
is how she put it.

32:03.680 --> 32:06.919
Cause of death?
Same as Bishop's wife.

32:06.920 --> 32:09.399
I'd prefer we wait on
the postmortem before we say that

32:09.400 --> 32:13.559
with any degree of certainty.
But, yes, there are similarities.

32:13.560 --> 32:17.399
If it's any help, the ropes have
been tied in a Somerville bowline.

32:17.400 --> 32:19.880
The same knot used on Katya Bishop.

32:59.560 --> 33:03.079
Katya Bishop was a tireless worker
for local charities

33:03.080 --> 33:06.439
and one of this city's
most popular residents.

33:06.440 --> 33:09.959
'We offer our deepest condolences
to her family

33:09.960 --> 33:12.959
'and we assure them that
we will be working around the clock

33:12.960 --> 33:17.839
'to bring the evil creature
responsible for this to justice.'

33:17.840 --> 33:20.039
And what about the young woman
murdered last night,

33:20.040 --> 33:23.279
named locally as Sophie Carrington?

33:23.280 --> 33:25.199
Has that been formally linked
to Katya Bishop?

33:25.200 --> 33:27.159
I'm afraid,
for sound operational reasons,

33:27.160 --> 33:30.439
we're unable to give details
about that particular investigation.

33:30.440 --> 33:33.439
ACC Vosper, if the killer
continues to elude your officers,

33:33.440 --> 33:35.479
will you allow
Detective Superintendent Grace

33:35.480 --> 33:36.600
to consult a medium?

33:37.840 --> 33:39.839
It's not normal practice
for the police to follow

33:39.840 --> 33:41.199
such lines of enquiry.

33:41.200 --> 33:44.239
But we will listen to anyone who
can provide us with information,

33:44.240 --> 33:47.319
and then we will assess how
it may progress the investigation.

33:47.320 --> 33:48.719
You don't rule it out, then?

33:48.720 --> 33:51.799
I think I've already given you
my answer. Any more questions?

33:51.800 --> 33:52.880
ACC Vosper?
DS Grace?

34:07.920 --> 34:09.959
PHONE VIBRATING

34:09.960 --> 34:13.239
Nick. 'Hi, Norm, I've got a name
and address for the account holder

34:13.240 --> 34:16.760
'at the landline that left a message
on Katya Bishop's mobile.'

34:26.440 --> 34:30.439
Mr Chancellor? DS Norman Potting.
East Sussex CID.

34:30.440 --> 34:32.999
I was wondering
if I might have a word.

34:33.000 --> 34:37.200
It's about Katya Bishop.
But you probably already know that.

34:38.360 --> 34:39.720
Come in.

34:44.520 --> 34:47.639
Do we have anything to place Bishop
at the scene with Sophie Carrington?

34:47.640 --> 34:49.999
No DNA evidence back as yet,

34:50.000 --> 34:53.439
but we have a neighbour who says
they saw a man outside the flat

34:53.440 --> 34:55.279
who may or may not be Bishop.

34:55.280 --> 34:57.639
They're coming in later
to help us develop an e-fit.

34:57.640 --> 34:59.919
Does he admit to knowing her?
I don't know.

34:59.920 --> 35:01.759
We... we're about to question him.

35:01.760 --> 35:06.239
Where are we with his story
about this "DS Canning"?

35:06.240 --> 35:12.160
Nobody of that name works anywhere
in East Sussex Constabulary, ma'am.

35:14.080 --> 35:16.999
So, either somebody got wind
that we had Bishop holed up

35:17.000 --> 35:19.919
in the Holiday Inn. Press, possibly?

35:19.920 --> 35:21.359
Or...?

35:21.360 --> 35:24.079
Or...

35:24.080 --> 35:25.520
he's lying.

35:26.600 --> 35:29.359
On the one hand,
he's a credible, grieving husband.

35:29.360 --> 35:33.439
On the other, he disappears off
radar, and the next thing you know,

35:33.440 --> 35:36.119
a young woman
he's supposedly involved with

35:36.120 --> 35:39.799
ends up murdered in similar
circumstances to his wife.

35:39.800 --> 35:41.879
And all the while,
he knows we're watching him.

35:41.880 --> 35:43.919
Is that some kind of compulsion?

35:43.920 --> 35:48.480
Or he's supremely confident in
his ability to get away with murder.

35:49.680 --> 35:52.999
So Mrs Bishop was with you
Thursday evening? Till what time?

35:53.000 --> 35:58.520
Erm... half-11, quarter to 12,
something like that. Ah.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.799
You and Mrs Bishop...

36:01.800 --> 36:03.480
was a full relationship, was it?

36:06.240 --> 36:07.480
She was lonely.

36:08.560 --> 36:12.239
Her husband was obsessed with work
and was never around.

36:12.240 --> 36:16.319
So she might've been less lonely
than bored and frustrated.

36:16.320 --> 36:17.800
How d'you meet?

36:19.760 --> 36:24.520
A charity Katya was involved with
auctioned off one of my paintings.

36:26.360 --> 36:28.400
And this is her, huh?

36:29.680 --> 36:31.999
How long's it take you
to do something like that?

36:32.000 --> 36:34.639
A week, maybe.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.120
Mm!

36:38.600 --> 36:42.960
Does the name "Sophie Carrington"
mean anything to you, Mr Bishop?

36:44.480 --> 36:46.120
No. No, it doesn't.

36:47.920 --> 36:50.759
Should it?
Not necessarily.

36:50.760 --> 36:54.599
I'd like to ask you about
a life insurance policy you took out

36:54.600 --> 36:58.039
on your wife
with South Laines Assurance

36:58.040 --> 37:00.599
six months ago for £4 million.

37:00.600 --> 37:03.239
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
I don't believe in life insurance.

37:03.240 --> 37:05.959
A copy of the policy
was found in your home.

37:05.960 --> 37:08.759
As may be,
but I've no knowledge of it.

37:08.760 --> 37:14.959
Look... I pay people to manage
all this for me. I just sign things.

37:14.960 --> 37:18.039
Mr Bishop's fiscal affairs
are quite complex.

37:18.040 --> 37:20.479
It's possible that that policy
was a requirement

37:20.480 --> 37:22.759
of a financial instrument
pertaining to the business.

37:22.760 --> 37:24.839
Or that it's something Mrs Bishop
took out herself.

37:24.840 --> 37:28.360
Do you have any further questions,
Detective Superintendent?

37:30.560 --> 37:32.479
He goes for a walk, a haircut
or an ice cream,

37:32.480 --> 37:34.439
I want to know. Yes?
OK. No problems, sir.

37:34.440 --> 37:37.959
So she sets up a life insurance
on herself that he's paying for

37:37.960 --> 37:40.119
but doesn't know about?
I don't buy it.

37:40.120 --> 37:42.360
I'll get Nick to chase
the financial adviser.

37:46.920 --> 37:50.199
He's lying, though, right?
About Sophie Carrington.

37:50.200 --> 37:52.839
Oh, yeah. He knows her. Or knew her.

37:52.840 --> 37:56.399
But you didn't want to push him?
Not yet, no.

37:56.400 --> 37:59.119
When I do, I want it backed up
by hard evidence.

37:59.120 --> 38:00.599
So he can't wriggle out of it.

38:00.600 --> 38:02.599
Let's see what her phone records
offer up.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.879
If Sophie told Holly the truth -

38:04.880 --> 38:08.159
about Bishop being at her place
the night his wife was killed -

38:08.160 --> 38:10.999
that would put him in the clear
for the murder, right?

38:11.000 --> 38:13.840
So why would he kill his alibi?

38:16.920 --> 38:20.839
Sophie Carrington. Ligature marks
and petechial haemorrhaging

38:20.840 --> 38:23.239
suggests cause of death
is again asphyxia.

38:23.240 --> 38:27.519
Penetrative sex has taken place,
but unlike with Mrs Bishop,

38:27.520 --> 38:31.599
the injuries are such it is highly
unlikely this was a consensual act.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.520
And there's another curiosity...

38:41.360 --> 38:43.719
That's the same tattoo
as Katya Bishop.

38:43.720 --> 38:47.560
Except this was most likely done
in the last 12 to 24 hours.

38:48.720 --> 38:51.839
Can we withdraw a sample of the ink
for analysis?

38:51.840 --> 38:54.799
If we identify the manufacturer,
we might be able to find out

38:54.800 --> 38:57.720
whoever they supplied in Brighton.
Already done.

39:01.040 --> 39:03.599
Maybe Bishop likes to mark
his property.

39:03.600 --> 39:06.799
He denies knowing her. He's not
gonna say he made her get a tattoo.

39:06.800 --> 39:10.039
Yeah. Look, I'll get a photo
of the tatt out to parlours -

39:10.040 --> 39:13.879
see if anyone recognises the style
or font of someone's handiwork.

39:13.880 --> 39:16.200
PHONE VIBRATING
Oh, hold on.

39:18.720 --> 39:20.639
Hello? DS Benson...

39:20.640 --> 39:22.439
Detective Superintendent?

39:22.440 --> 39:24.919
Roy, Miss Morey.

39:24.920 --> 39:27.039
Cleo.

39:27.040 --> 39:29.519
Look, erm...

39:29.520 --> 39:31.640
do you want to go for a drink?

39:33.680 --> 39:35.519
Yes.

39:35.520 --> 39:37.319
Yes, I do.

39:37.320 --> 39:39.240
OK. Erm, two minutes?

39:45.960 --> 39:50.639
That was Sandra Taylor, analyst
at the Force Intelligence Unit.

39:50.640 --> 39:52.319
Did you know Bishop has previous?

39:52.320 --> 39:55.599
Two years at a young offenders'
for sexual assault

39:55.600 --> 39:57.159
on a 15-year-old girl at his school.

39:57.160 --> 40:00.359
And an 18-month probation at 20
for GBH on another woman.

40:00.360 --> 40:03.639
Well, I can see
why he might be reluctant

40:03.640 --> 40:05.159
to volunteer that information.

40:05.160 --> 40:08.159
Shall I bring him in?
When we're ready.

40:08.160 --> 40:11.680
If he thinks he's playing with us,
let's let him think it.

40:12.800 --> 40:14.719
When the time comes,
I want to lay out our cards

40:14.720 --> 40:17.119
nine, ten, jack.

40:17.120 --> 40:19.799
OK. So, back to base, yeah?

40:19.800 --> 40:23.719
I'm gonna... I'm gonna hang on here
for a minute.

40:23.720 --> 40:27.559
You're gonna hang on at a mortuary?
For what?

40:27.560 --> 40:30.799
Er, I'm gonna have a word
with Dr De Sancha.

40:30.800 --> 40:32.840
I'll wait, no worries.
No, you're all right.

40:39.360 --> 40:41.999
All good?
You're, er...?

40:42.000 --> 40:44.599
Booking off. Booking off, so...

40:44.600 --> 40:47.720
Yeah, er... understood.

40:51.960 --> 40:53.959
Shall we?
Yeah.

40:53.960 --> 40:57.679
So, what was all that about?
All what?

40:57.680 --> 40:59.080
CLEO CHUCKLING

41:00.120 --> 41:02.480
INDISTINCT CHATTER

41:12.440 --> 41:17.239
It's funny.
Most days, it doesn't touch you,

41:17.240 --> 41:18.680
and others...

41:19.920 --> 41:21.639
It's the cruelty.

41:21.640 --> 41:24.359
That's what's hard to take.
Yeah.

41:24.360 --> 41:26.879
When you bring intent into it.

41:26.880 --> 41:33.319
The stuff that freaks most people -
the motorway accidents, the fires,

41:33.320 --> 41:36.200
people barely recognisable
as people.

41:38.160 --> 41:41.639
That's just physical.
Because accidents happen, right?

41:41.640 --> 41:44.959
And it's not personal and it's...
it's just any one of us.

41:44.960 --> 41:47.480
Mm.
Luck of the draw.

41:50.680 --> 41:53.319
Do you wanna go
and get something to eat?

41:53.320 --> 41:54.999
Yeah.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.960
Yeah, food would be good.

42:02.240 --> 42:05.359
You recently remortgaged the house
on Ocean Rise, didn't you?

42:05.360 --> 42:08.759
Yeah. Had to raise some cash
for a rights issue.

42:08.760 --> 42:11.519
We had a brief liquidity problem.
Why?

42:11.520 --> 42:13.359
Well, mortgage companies
normally require

42:13.360 --> 42:16.079
some kind of life-insurance cover
on large loans.

42:16.080 --> 42:17.440
Maybe that's why you did it?

42:19.520 --> 42:22.120
I'll call your financial adviser
in the morning.

42:24.200 --> 42:27.199
Right, I'm gonna go to the workshop
for a couple of hours.

42:27.200 --> 42:29.799
Think working on the car
might take my mind off things.

42:29.800 --> 42:30.959
What if the police call?

42:30.960 --> 42:33.919
You can let me know,
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

42:33.920 --> 42:37.199
Can I take your car?
They're watching mine.

42:37.200 --> 42:39.760
There's a back way out, right?

42:57.000 --> 43:00.880
This was nice.
Yes. Yes, it was.

43:03.160 --> 43:06.199
I'm not going to sleep with you.
No...

43:06.200 --> 43:07.919
Tonight, I mean.

43:07.920 --> 43:10.840
To clarify, I-I am going
to sleep with you, just...

43:12.160 --> 43:15.079
..not tonight.
OK. Good.

43:15.080 --> 43:18.559
Good?
To have clarity.

43:18.560 --> 43:21.439
I mean, that's assuming
you want to sleep with me.

43:21.440 --> 43:23.999
Do you want to sleep with me?

43:24.000 --> 43:28.840
Would you like it in writing or is
there a form I can fill in online?

43:30.080 --> 43:31.600
Thanks.

43:32.800 --> 43:36.720
For what? For not making tonight
a history lesson.

43:37.840 --> 43:41.520
I'm not big on all our yesterdays.

43:43.360 --> 43:46.079
Some dates you go on,
there's so much of it,

43:46.080 --> 43:48.559
you come away thinking
you've had a past-life experience.

43:48.560 --> 43:51.400
Do you know what I mean?
Yes, I do.

43:52.480 --> 43:55.120
But you didn't talk about your past.

43:56.800 --> 43:57.960
Not once.

44:01.480 --> 44:02.760
Nor did you.

44:04.360 --> 44:07.719
Oh, I'm all about the now.
Are you?

44:07.720 --> 44:12.479
Not the right now, obviously.
I-I think they want to close.

44:12.480 --> 44:15.399
Erm, sorry, can I get the bill,
please?

44:15.400 --> 44:17.799
Can I get this...?
Please!

44:17.800 --> 44:21.040
Did Destiny's Child
teach you nothing?

44:23.360 --> 44:24.920
You can do the tip.

44:54.480 --> 44:56.040
This is me.

44:58.720 --> 45:01.239
I'd invite you in, but, erm...

45:01.240 --> 45:04.520
you might wake the goldfish.
You keep goldfish?

45:05.640 --> 45:07.760
Just one. For the conversation.

45:08.920 --> 45:11.199
So do I.
Oh!

45:11.200 --> 45:13.359
Yeah, Marlon. He's a Kawarimono.

45:13.360 --> 45:16.959
Is he? Kawarimono.

45:16.960 --> 45:19.399
What's that,
some sort of Chinese carp?

45:19.400 --> 45:23.839
Yes, it is. Yeah.
I won him at a raffle.

45:23.840 --> 45:29.160
How about you? Er, just, erm,
a common or garden funfair.

45:32.360 --> 45:33.560
So, erm...

45:38.280 --> 45:39.879
Rematch?

45:39.880 --> 45:41.840
Sure.

45:47.880 --> 45:50.280
Which one of us
had the garlic bread?

45:51.400 --> 45:52.679
Oh, that was me.

45:52.680 --> 45:56.239
Yeah. See, something like that,
you need to plan ahead.

45:56.240 --> 45:57.760
Mm.

45:59.800 --> 46:01.160
Next time.

46:36.520 --> 46:38.920
Thanks for the lift, Darren.
Don't mention it.

46:40.880 --> 46:42.320
Er, Cle?

46:43.840 --> 46:47.079
SHE GROANS
What?!

46:47.080 --> 46:49.519
Further to the discovery
of a car park ticket

46:49.520 --> 46:52.479
found in Katya Bishop's vehicle,
issued Thursday afternoon

46:52.480 --> 46:55.479
at a pay and despair
on Salvesen Street in Lewes...

46:55.480 --> 46:58.319
Pay and display, surely?
Have you ever been to Lewes?

46:58.320 --> 47:04.079
A landline number on Katya Bishop's
mobile turned up Barty Chancellor,

47:04.080 --> 47:07.719
an artist on... Salvesen Street.

47:07.720 --> 47:10.559
Now yesterday, I went to see him,
and he admitted to me

47:10.560 --> 47:13.879
that he was the man saying,
"See you later," on her voicemail.

47:13.880 --> 47:16.079
So they were having an affair.
Exactly.

47:16.080 --> 47:19.479
She left him around half-11
Thursday night,

47:19.480 --> 47:21.399
which would agree with the time
on her receipt

47:21.400 --> 47:23.199
from the garage on the A27.

47:23.200 --> 47:26.519
Now, CCTV for that is coming in
this morning.

47:26.520 --> 47:28.959
What d'you make of him?
What, Chancellor?

47:28.960 --> 47:32.359
Oh, he's no love for Mr Bishop,
but he certainly likes the ladies.

47:32.360 --> 47:35.879
Plenty of raunchy nudes on display -
including one or two of Mrs Bishop.

47:35.880 --> 47:37.279
Define "raunchy".

47:37.280 --> 47:39.999
Well, not the sort of stuff
you'd want to show your elderly mum.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.519
You don't know my elderly mum.
Well, either way,

47:42.520 --> 47:44.399
he's coming in at half-nine
to make a statement

47:44.400 --> 47:47.839
so you can ask him yourself.
Now, I also spoke to Tessa Merrick,

47:47.840 --> 47:49.999
who's the wife of Bishop's
golfing partner

47:50.000 --> 47:51.359
and good friend of Katya's,

47:51.360 --> 47:56.520
who said she thought she was gonna
give lover-boy the Spanish archer.

48:00.280 --> 48:01.800
She was going to leave him.

48:04.040 --> 48:08.840
For all the philanthropy
and charity stuff you read about...

48:10.080 --> 48:15.320
..Kit Bishop is a very nasty
piece of work.

48:16.440 --> 48:19.319
In what way?
Was he violent towards her?

48:19.320 --> 48:22.920
Not physically,
but mentally very cruel.

48:24.160 --> 48:27.600
Obsessive and extremely jealous.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.199
You said earlier
that you have no alibi

48:31.200 --> 48:33.999
for after Mrs Bishop
left your house.

48:34.000 --> 48:39.400
It was nearly midnight
by the time Katya left and...

48:41.120 --> 48:42.879
..I fell asleep.

48:42.880 --> 48:45.799
It's been put to us that Mrs Bishop

48:45.800 --> 48:48.599
was thinking of ending
your relationship.

48:48.600 --> 48:50.160
Is that true?

48:52.280 --> 48:53.520
If she was...

48:55.080 --> 48:56.719
..it's the first
I've heard about it.

48:56.720 --> 48:59.960
So, she didn't break it off with you
Thursday night? No!

49:02.840 --> 49:06.200
We were going to spend
the rest of our lives together.

49:18.880 --> 49:22.560
If you need to go home, please do.
No, I'll be fine. Thank you.

49:30.360 --> 49:32.439
The body you pulled out of the sea -

49:32.440 --> 49:34.839
just been identified
by her dental records.

49:34.840 --> 49:36.279
Julia Abbott.

49:36.280 --> 49:40.719
Looks like she was dead
before she went in to the water.

49:40.720 --> 49:43.439
Julia,
head-of-the-PNC-department Julia?

49:43.440 --> 49:47.639
Left to go "travelling"?
She was getting married.

49:47.640 --> 49:52.320
Has the fiance been notified?
We're trying to find him.

49:57.160 --> 49:59.079
Anything from the garage?

49:59.080 --> 50:01.359
A new roof for my MG would be nice.

50:01.360 --> 50:04.239
Actually, I've got a hard-top
in the shed.

50:04.240 --> 50:06.039
You couldn't follow us
back from work

50:06.040 --> 50:09.239
and help me put it on, could you?
Sure. Anything for you, Cle.

50:09.240 --> 50:10.920
I'll fetch you back
a Turkish delight.

50:13.800 --> 50:18.039
OK, this is CCTV footage of the
forecourt of the petrol station.

50:18.040 --> 50:21.759
We're on the Westbound A27
just outside of Lewes,

50:21.760 --> 50:26.079
where Katya Bishop stopped
at 11:58 Thursday.

50:26.080 --> 50:27.440
This is her there.

50:28.560 --> 50:32.999
Now, the Merc at pump six
has dash cams fore and aft.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.719
The rear are facing away,
down the slip road to the garage.

50:36.720 --> 50:41.119
Now, these are the headlights
of a van that was dumped on the road

50:41.120 --> 50:42.399
just outside of the garage.

50:42.400 --> 50:45.679
Now, it was stolen in Lewes
that afternoon

50:45.680 --> 50:46.999
and belongs to Juwett and Co,

50:47.000 --> 50:49.480
which is a South Coast
spray painting services.

50:52.160 --> 50:56.039
Meanwhile, the Merc fills his tank,
Mrs Bishop waits for a coffee.

50:56.040 --> 50:59.439
Mrs Stacey, who's in
the people carrier, she pays.

50:59.440 --> 51:02.359
And what about the driver
of the Range Rover?

51:02.360 --> 51:05.479
Pays at the pump.
But now this is where it gets weird.

51:05.480 --> 51:09.519
Mrs Stacey, in the people carrier,
has her daughters in the back.

51:09.520 --> 51:11.279
Now one of them is asleep,

51:11.280 --> 51:15.000
but the other looks across
to Katya Bishop's car.

51:17.440 --> 51:19.919
Now, the little girl
didn't mention it at the time,

51:19.920 --> 51:22.639
but ever since that night,
she's awoken with nightmares

51:22.640 --> 51:24.839
about a man with a scary face.

51:24.840 --> 51:26.319
Anything in that?

51:26.320 --> 51:29.159
Well, normally I'd put it down
to kids playing silly buggers,

51:29.160 --> 51:31.399
but Mr Juwett, who owns the van,

51:31.400 --> 51:34.479
said a gas mask was taken
from the vehicle.

51:34.480 --> 51:38.399
A gas mask?
Well, a... a full-head respirator -

51:38.400 --> 51:40.359
he uses it for spray painting.

51:40.360 --> 51:43.199
He said that was the only thing
that had gone missing.

51:43.200 --> 51:45.479
DOORBELL

51:45.480 --> 51:48.720
Who is, please?
MAN: Gas board, meter reading.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.400
SHE UNLOCKS DOOR

52:07.000 --> 52:09.479
So, what do we think?

52:09.480 --> 52:12.160
Did Bishop know that Chancellor
was sleeping with his wife?

52:13.280 --> 52:18.839
Did he dump his Jag, steal a van,
tail her to the petrol station

52:18.840 --> 52:21.159
so that she wouldn't recognise
his car?

52:21.160 --> 52:23.559
Why not just wait for her at home?

52:23.560 --> 52:26.199
To avoid CCTV and Traf-cams,
presumably.

52:26.200 --> 52:28.199
Yeah, or was it Barty Chancellor
getting her back

52:28.200 --> 52:31.279
because she'd chucked him? Only he's
too smart to kill her at his place.

52:31.280 --> 52:33.479
Or someone we don't know about.

52:33.480 --> 52:36.039
Which of 'em's most likely to know
this Somerville knot?

52:36.040 --> 52:38.279
Well, Barty Chancellor
strings his own frames

52:38.280 --> 52:40.039
cos I saw that at his studio.

52:40.040 --> 52:42.839
Bishop's financial adviser
finally got back.

52:42.840 --> 52:46.879
Receipt for their restaurant bill
is time stamped at 9:57.

52:46.880 --> 52:49.719
He says he put Bishop in a taxi
on Piccadilly

52:49.720 --> 52:52.000
for his flat at Notting Hill
just after ten.

52:53.200 --> 52:56.639
So say he was home by, what, 10:20,

52:56.640 --> 52:59.079
he'd have to get from there

52:59.080 --> 53:01.599
to the ANPR picking up
his licence plate

53:01.600 --> 53:07.879
on the M23 outside Gatwick by 10:47.
So that's 27 minutes.

53:07.880 --> 53:10.879
It could be done.
He's a professional racer.

53:10.880 --> 53:13.959
Well, let's see if we can get
a Traf-Pol unit

53:13.960 --> 53:15.639
to make that run in that time.

53:15.640 --> 53:18.999
The concierge also confirmed
that he did help Bishop

53:19.000 --> 53:21.519
load his golf clubs into his Jag
at 6:30,

53:21.520 --> 53:23.359
and then he saw him off
for Brighton.

53:23.360 --> 53:26.039
Did the financial adviser say
anything about the life insurance?

53:26.040 --> 53:28.319
Only that if Bishop did take out
insurance on his wife,

53:28.320 --> 53:30.600
then he did so privately.

53:33.920 --> 53:37.279
What do you mean he's not here?
My client's not under arrest.

53:37.280 --> 53:38.919
You've not charged him
with anything,

53:38.920 --> 53:41.439
you've no evidence
of any wrongdoing on his part.

53:41.440 --> 53:43.879
He's the grieving widower
of a murder victim.

53:43.880 --> 53:45.999
You want to speak to him,
make an appointment

53:46.000 --> 53:48.960
and I'll see if he's agreeable
to meet you here. So, where is he?

53:53.240 --> 53:55.439
Look, I'm sure you think
you're helping your client

53:55.440 --> 53:58.079
by not answering,
but when he does turn up,

53:58.080 --> 53:59.519
I want him down at the station

53:59.520 --> 54:02.440
where he will be
formally interviewed. OK?

54:31.800 --> 54:34.080
PHONE VIBRATING

54:39.440 --> 54:43.320
Hello. Hi, it's me.
I know. Your name comes up.

54:45.080 --> 54:46.879
So, how was your day?

54:46.880 --> 54:50.879
Er, my day is the roof of my MG
got slashed overnight,

54:50.880 --> 54:52.879
so that was nice to come in to.

54:52.880 --> 54:55.559
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

54:55.560 --> 54:58.719
'Forget it. It's probably kids.'

54:58.720 --> 55:00.639
Anyway, Darren's gonna pick me up
from work

55:00.640 --> 55:03.639
and help me put the hard top on.
I'll be getting jealous.

55:03.640 --> 55:06.639
'Why don't you come round later?'

55:06.640 --> 55:08.359
OK.

55:08.360 --> 55:10.800
'If you're sure.'
THUD

55:12.920 --> 55:14.279
Hello?

55:14.280 --> 55:15.760
Who is it?

55:17.920 --> 55:20.279
'Hello?'
Cleo?

55:20.280 --> 55:21.679
L-listen, I've gotta go.

55:21.680 --> 55:24.400
I'll... I'll see you tonight.
All right? Bye.

55:33.960 --> 55:35.320
Hello?

55:57.120 --> 55:58.639
Jesus, Darren!

55:58.640 --> 56:02.480
Why didn't you answer me?
I had my buds in.

56:04.400 --> 56:07.279
The garage was out of Turkish.
Sorry.

56:07.280 --> 56:11.440
Now let's talk about your...
juvenile conviction.

56:12.480 --> 56:16.039
My what? Two years
in a young offenders' institute

56:16.040 --> 56:18.839
for the sexual assault of
a young girl. No, wait a minute...

56:18.840 --> 56:21.279
My client's never been convicted
of anything in his life.

56:21.280 --> 56:24.239
It may have been a long time ago
and he may have been a juvenile,

56:24.240 --> 56:27.519
Ms Vernon,
but these offences remain on file.

56:27.520 --> 56:31.319
As does his GBH against a woman
committed aged 20,

56:31.320 --> 56:33.559
for which he received
an 18-month probation.

56:33.560 --> 56:36.439
I mean, we have it on record,
Mr Bishop. This is not my...

56:36.440 --> 56:38.960
I suggest you check your records
again because they're wrong.

56:40.000 --> 56:43.240
How about Mr Bishop's
mobile telephone records...

56:44.320 --> 56:46.719
..are they also wrong?

56:46.720 --> 56:51.640
The last call that Sophie Carrington
made was to you.

56:53.360 --> 56:57.279
And on close examination
of both your call histories

56:57.280 --> 56:59.279
throughout the year,

56:59.280 --> 57:02.639
it becomes clear there's a
significant amount of communication

57:02.640 --> 57:04.759
between the two of you.

57:04.760 --> 57:06.080
Any comment?

57:07.280 --> 57:08.840
You don't have to answer that.

57:12.160 --> 57:13.880
I met her at a conference.

57:15.440 --> 57:17.919
It was a flirtation,
but that was all.

57:17.920 --> 57:20.279
So you never slept with her?

57:20.280 --> 57:22.679
No.
Right.

57:22.680 --> 57:27.199
Only, she told her best friend
that you turned up at her flat

57:27.200 --> 57:30.760
in the small hours of Friday morning
and did exactly that.

57:32.880 --> 57:36.279
The last time I spoke to Sophie,
I-I told her about Katya

57:36.280 --> 57:39.919
and I...
I felt that you suspected me.

57:39.920 --> 57:42.519
And she said to tell you
that I'd been with her all night.

57:42.520 --> 57:45.920
So why didn't you?
Because it wasn't true.

57:47.280 --> 57:49.759
OK, she thought she was making up
an alibi because, well...

57:49.760 --> 57:51.999
because, well, clearly,
she had a crush on me.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.240
But I said it was better to tell the
truth when dealing with the police.

57:59.680 --> 58:04.680
Were you aware your wife
was having an affair, Mr Bishop?

58:08.840 --> 58:12.399
Was it the artist in Lewes?
You knew about him, then?

58:12.400 --> 58:15.240
Not knew, suspected. Feared.

58:17.480 --> 58:19.759
I knew she'd got close to him
when he did her portrait,

58:19.760 --> 58:23.040
but, er, I suppose
I didn't want to believe it.

58:24.560 --> 58:26.799
How did you feel...

58:26.800 --> 58:31.559
when you suspected that your wife
was being unfaithful?

58:31.560 --> 58:33.760
You mean, did I want to kill her?

58:35.080 --> 58:36.599
Did you?

58:36.600 --> 58:38.080
No.

58:40.920 --> 58:44.399
OK. E-fit of a man
seen by a neighbour

58:44.400 --> 58:48.119
outside Sophie Carrington's flat
at eight o'clock Friday night.

58:48.120 --> 58:50.879
That's Bishop, isn't it?
It's got to be.

58:50.880 --> 58:52.879
So we've got
his wife's life insurance,

58:52.880 --> 58:55.799
his previous criminal record -
why aren't we bringing him in?

58:55.800 --> 59:00.319
He and his lawyer say
our records are wrong.

59:00.320 --> 59:02.639
But we're not giving that
any credence, are we?

59:02.640 --> 59:04.639
I'll double-check it with Lorna
when she gets in,

59:04.640 --> 59:07.119
but I can't see
there's anything in it.

59:07.120 --> 59:10.639
I think they're just trying
to avoid damage to brand Bishop.

59:10.640 --> 59:13.239
And also, ma'am,
we've got two independent witnesses

59:13.240 --> 59:16.559
that place him in London either side
of the time of his wife's murder.

59:16.560 --> 59:18.839
Yeah, but there's an ANPR camera

59:18.840 --> 59:21.959
that puts him at Gatwick,
heading south.

59:21.960 --> 59:24.679
We had a traffic unit
make the same run

59:24.680 --> 59:27.119
and they made it
by the skin of their teeth -

59:27.120 --> 59:30.679
and that was using blues and twos.
He didn't have that advantage.

59:30.680 --> 59:33.879
The camera never lies, Roy.
It could be false plates.

59:33.880 --> 59:36.319
Villains, maybe. Career crims.

59:36.320 --> 59:38.759
One half of Brighton's
golden couple? Please.

59:38.760 --> 59:41.199
Well, they could've switched it
on the hard shoulder

59:41.200 --> 59:43.799
just after they were clocked
by the cameras, couldn't they?

59:43.800 --> 59:46.999
You're not seriously suggesting you
don't think that Bishop did this?

59:47.000 --> 59:48.079
Not for a second.

59:48.080 --> 59:51.079
All I know is that whatever pieces
we've got,

59:51.080 --> 59:53.559
we've gotta make them fit,

59:53.560 --> 59:55.640
otherwise it's not gonna
stand up in court.

1:00:08.480 --> 1:00:11.879
Oi, there! It's an MG.

1:00:11.880 --> 1:00:14.839
And it's the right colour, look. Go.
All right, babe, slow down.

1:00:14.840 --> 1:00:16.560
I'm gonna miss the lights, aren't I?

1:00:20.280 --> 1:00:23.040
All right, well, not too far up
his arse - you're gonna spook him.

1:00:27.200 --> 1:00:29.880
Oh, so that's where he lives, then.

1:00:31.640 --> 1:00:35.400
Don't look, just drive past
and pull in round the corner.

1:00:39.480 --> 1:00:41.480
CLUNKING OUTSIDE

1:00:46.320 --> 1:00:47.880
What the...?

1:00:54.520 --> 1:00:57.879
Oi! Oi!

1:00:57.880 --> 1:01:00.239
What you doing? Open the door!

1:01:00.240 --> 1:01:03.239
Oi, this is my bloody car,
you little bastard.

1:01:03.240 --> 1:01:05.479
Open the door!

1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:07.719
ENGINE JUDDERS,
BOOM

1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:10.360
HE SCREAMS

1:01:32.720 --> 1:01:35.360
SIRENS APPROACHING
Here, take this.

1:01:38.080 --> 1:01:42.320
Are you all right?
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1:01:57.080 --> 1:02:00.839
Roy. Our car thief is Sonny Kirke,

1:02:00.840 --> 1:02:04.519
AKA Skunk. Prolific offender.

1:02:04.520 --> 1:02:07.559
High-end and collectible motors
stolen to order.

1:02:07.560 --> 1:02:09.799
According to CSI,
there's no question

1:02:09.800 --> 1:02:11.239
the vehicle was sabotaged.

1:02:11.240 --> 1:02:13.839
Was set to blow whenever
an electrical connection

1:02:13.840 --> 1:02:14.959
was made to the ignition.

1:02:14.960 --> 1:02:16.959
The wiring
of the central door locking system

1:02:16.960 --> 1:02:19.439
was also tampered with.
So specialist knowledge, then.

1:02:19.440 --> 1:02:20.719
Absolutely.

1:02:20.720 --> 1:02:23.959
CSI's opinion - whoever did this
intended to kill the driver.

1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:25.440
No doubt.

1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:31.759
Look, I'm sorry that it's me
that has to ask you this,

1:02:31.760 --> 1:02:36.479
but is there anybody from your
personal life, an ex maybe...

1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:40.639
Erm... Well, there was a guy
who was weird for a while

1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:44.519
after we broke up, but that
was years ago. I can't imagine...

1:02:44.520 --> 1:02:46.400
You can never tell what people
are capable of.

1:02:47.920 --> 1:02:50.719
Erm, is there... is there any news
on that poor boy?

1:02:50.720 --> 1:02:53.680
He's in the burns unit.
Could go either way.

1:02:55.320 --> 1:03:00.239
This isn't how I live, Roy.
This isn't... my world.

1:03:00.240 --> 1:03:05.359
Crazy people and car bombs
or whatever it was...

1:03:05.360 --> 1:03:06.840
I know.

1:03:08.320 --> 1:03:12.159
Listen, I've asked for
extra uniform patrols here

1:03:12.160 --> 1:03:14.319
and at the mortuary.
OK.

1:03:14.320 --> 1:03:18.400
I'll come round tonight,
if that's all right? Yeah.

1:03:19.600 --> 1:03:23.000
We'll find them. OK?
Yeah.

1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:42.120
MACHINE WHIRRING

1:04:27.960 --> 1:04:29.520
CLATTER

1:04:54.520 --> 1:04:56.880
You really shouldn't be here,
Mr Bishop.

1:04:58.440 --> 1:05:01.480
I just came back to get
a fresh change of clothes.

1:05:03.120 --> 1:05:06.440
And a watch.
I'll need to go through these.

1:05:16.160 --> 1:05:18.040
"An evil creature."

1:05:21.080 --> 1:05:24.119
That's what you called him.
Is that what you think?

1:05:24.120 --> 1:05:26.759
Well, he's certainly
a deeply disturbed individual.

1:05:26.760 --> 1:05:28.839
Yeah.

1:05:28.840 --> 1:05:30.599
Perhaps.

1:05:30.600 --> 1:05:33.679
What if it was someone
with a genuine grievance?

1:05:33.680 --> 1:05:36.640
Nothing justifies the murder
of another human being, Mr Bishop.

1:05:38.880 --> 1:05:42.320
I've been reading about you.

1:05:43.440 --> 1:05:46.199
If you had the person who killed
your wife in front of you,

1:05:46.200 --> 1:05:48.080
wouldn't you want to kill them?

1:05:50.920 --> 1:05:53.039
Well, I don't know that she IS dead.

1:05:53.040 --> 1:05:57.399
But if she were, and I had
the person responsible at my mercy,

1:05:57.400 --> 1:06:01.639
I would like to think I'd have
the strength to do the right thing.

1:06:01.640 --> 1:06:04.560
Right by law or right by nature?
Right by justice.

1:06:07.480 --> 1:06:10.240
If someone had hurt me in that way,
I wouldn't think twice.

1:06:12.360 --> 1:06:16.359
I doubt Bobbie Vernon would be
very happy with that answer.

1:06:16.360 --> 1:06:17.480
Who cares what he wants?

1:06:18.920 --> 1:06:20.440
Your lawyer, Mr Bishop...

1:06:22.280 --> 1:06:23.439
..Ms Vernon.

1:06:23.440 --> 1:06:27.160
Sorry. I thought you meant Bobby
Farnon, Head of Public Relations.

1:06:29.640 --> 1:06:32.480
Sorry, it's been
a difficult few days.

1:06:34.200 --> 1:06:35.240
Course.

1:06:39.240 --> 1:06:43.439
Now, I really am going to have
to ask you to leave, Mr Bishop.

1:06:43.440 --> 1:06:44.760
Yeah.

1:06:57.640 --> 1:06:59.399
Hey, Lorna.
Hey.

1:06:59.400 --> 1:07:01.759
Could you look up, er,
a criminal record for me?

1:07:01.760 --> 1:07:07.400
Kit Desmond Bishop, 07.09.1978.
Sure.

1:07:10.240 --> 1:07:12.519
I was so sorry to hear about Julia.

1:07:12.520 --> 1:07:13.599
Yeah.

1:07:13.600 --> 1:07:15.479
One minute she's falling in love

1:07:15.480 --> 1:07:18.959
and moving to Australia
to get married... and now...

1:07:18.960 --> 1:07:21.159
What about her family,
have they been notified?

1:07:21.160 --> 1:07:25.119
There was only Julia.
Late and only child.

1:07:25.120 --> 1:07:26.799
What about her fiance?

1:07:26.800 --> 1:07:30.399
All she'd say is he was married
but he wouldn't be soon,

1:07:30.400 --> 1:07:33.599
and that he was very well off.

1:07:33.600 --> 1:07:35.439
Right, here's your man, Bishop.

1:07:35.440 --> 1:07:38.999
1993 - Brighton Juvenile court.

1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:41.439
Two years in a young offenders'
for sexual assault

1:07:41.440 --> 1:07:42.959
on a 15-year-old girl.

1:07:42.960 --> 1:07:48.079
1999 - 18 months' probation
for GBH on a woman.

1:07:48.080 --> 1:07:52.439
And it's a regular entry, is it?
There's no anomaly of any kind?

1:07:52.440 --> 1:07:54.199
He's denying any previous.

1:07:54.200 --> 1:07:56.519
The only time records
as old as these get amended

1:07:56.520 --> 1:08:00.119
is if there's new evidence,
a conviction being quashed

1:08:00.120 --> 1:08:01.839
or a mistake that needs rectifying.

1:08:01.840 --> 1:08:05.559
Er, there's an electronic footprint
left anytime they're changed.

1:08:05.560 --> 1:08:08.599
Actually... there's one here.

1:08:08.600 --> 1:08:11.320
That's strange. It's Julia's code.

1:08:12.600 --> 1:08:15.879
You think Julia Abbott gave Bishop
a bogus criminal history?

1:08:15.880 --> 1:08:19.960
What if, instead of adding it,
she just reinstated it?

1:08:21.240 --> 1:08:24.759
Go on.
Boyfriend's married, right? Loaded.

1:08:24.760 --> 1:08:27.159
What if her mystery man is Bishop?

1:08:27.160 --> 1:08:29.439
Say he got close to Julia, right,
he buttered her up,

1:08:29.440 --> 1:08:31.639
promised her the earth
to get rid of his criminal past.

1:08:31.640 --> 1:08:34.599
So, why does she alter it
on her last day at work?

1:08:34.600 --> 1:08:36.999
Then why put it back?

1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:40.519
I don't know, maybe she...
sussed his true nature,

1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:42.720
and was gonna call it off.
They argue...

1:08:44.040 --> 1:08:45.839
..she tells him what she's done.

1:08:45.840 --> 1:08:48.439
He kills her for it,
dumps her body in the sea.

1:08:48.440 --> 1:08:50.079
Have you got a minute?

1:08:50.080 --> 1:08:52.399
I've put together Bishop's movements

1:08:52.400 --> 1:08:55.440
the night Sophie Carrington
was murdered. Something's off.

1:08:58.120 --> 1:09:01.719
Half-seven - mobile phone plotting
has him leaving his hotel

1:09:01.720 --> 1:09:02.999
and heading east.

1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:07.119
He's caught on CCTV at
Little East Street at five to eight.

1:09:07.120 --> 1:09:09.039
Er, that's a completely
different direction

1:09:09.040 --> 1:09:11.639
from the one he'd have to take
to get to Sophie Carrington's.

1:09:11.640 --> 1:09:13.319
Here's the kicker.

1:09:13.320 --> 1:09:16.359
He's sighted again at 8:07
in front of the Arches.

1:09:16.360 --> 1:09:18.599
Mobile masts indicate Bishop
remained static

1:09:18.600 --> 1:09:21.359
for the next 45 minutes
and headed back to his hotel.

1:09:21.360 --> 1:09:23.599
Staff at Arrows, a seafront bar,

1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:26.279
confirmed he was there -
8:10 to 8:50.

1:09:26.280 --> 1:09:30.039
Then how was he outside
Sophie Carrington's at eight?

1:09:30.040 --> 1:09:33.199
I mean, the distance is too great
to cover, even by taxi.

1:09:33.200 --> 1:09:36.039
Which means either Bishop
didn't kill Sophie Carrington

1:09:36.040 --> 1:09:37.919
or he had an accomplice.

1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:39.879
Or...

1:09:39.880 --> 1:09:43.320
I mean, a man can't be in two places
at the same time, can he?

1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:50.840
What do we know about his family?

1:09:54.320 --> 1:09:57.319
KIT BISHOP: 'I was an only child.
Adopted.'

1:09:57.320 --> 1:09:59.399
You know, I found out
after my mother died.

1:09:59.400 --> 1:10:03.400
I was going through her papers
and found my adoption papers.

1:10:05.520 --> 1:10:07.760
One small thing, Mr Bishop.

1:10:08.760 --> 1:10:10.760
Do you know Julia Abbott?

1:10:12.200 --> 1:10:14.679
No. Never heard of her.
Why? Who is she?

1:10:14.680 --> 1:10:17.039
If you really don't know her,
Mr Bishop, it doesn't matter.

1:10:17.040 --> 1:10:19.639
She won't mean anything to you.

1:10:19.640 --> 1:10:23.199
Did you ever make any attempt
to find your birth parents?

1:10:23.200 --> 1:10:24.639
Katya looked into it, I think.

1:10:24.640 --> 1:10:26.759
She got hold of
my original birth certificate.

1:10:26.760 --> 1:10:29.679
But it's not a rock I ever wanted
to look under. Can we see it?

1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:31.559
It's at the house.

1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:34.720
It's in a safe that's hidden
in the walk-in wardrobe.

1:10:48.280 --> 1:10:52.039
Birth Certificate.
Desmond William Matthews.

1:10:52.040 --> 1:10:56.840
September 7th 1978. 3:47am.

1:10:58.520 --> 1:11:01.399
That's it, then, isn't it?
That's what?

1:11:01.400 --> 1:11:06.359
3:47am. In England and Wales,
the time of birth is only put down

1:11:06.360 --> 1:11:08.639
for multiple births.

1:11:08.640 --> 1:11:10.999
That's Kit Bishop's adoption notice,
presumably.

1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:14.079
It's an adoption notice,
but not for him.

1:11:14.080 --> 1:11:16.839
Frederick Roger Matthews.

1:11:16.840 --> 1:11:19.959
Looks like Katya Bishop
got somewhere with her digging.

1:11:19.960 --> 1:11:23.279
Derek and Joan Talbot. Here, look,
there's a Dorking address.

1:11:23.280 --> 1:11:26.440
Presumably that's Frederick's
adoptive parents.

1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:30.440
Kit Bishop has a twin brother.

1:11:41.120 --> 1:11:45.679
Freddie was premature.
Emergency caesarean.

1:11:45.680 --> 1:11:50.879
His lungs were under developed,
so he always had a weak chest.

1:11:50.880 --> 1:11:52.880
And very bad asthma.

1:11:54.120 --> 1:11:56.280
Do you know anything
about his twin brother?

1:11:57.640 --> 1:12:01.079
Only his name. Desmond.

1:12:01.080 --> 1:12:03.160
He died.
Sorry...

1:12:04.280 --> 1:12:06.160
..are you sure
Freddie's brother died?

1:12:07.680 --> 1:12:10.680
Well, that's what we were told
by Social Services.

1:12:12.160 --> 1:12:15.520
I can't see why they would say
he had if he hadn't.

1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:19.799
Where can we find Freddie,
Mrs Talbot?

1:12:19.800 --> 1:12:22.959
It's rather important
that we speak with him.

1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:25.520
You can't, I'm afraid.
Why not?

1:12:27.200 --> 1:12:31.039
He went to a party...
Millennium eve.

1:12:31.040 --> 1:12:33.679
Forgot to take his inhaler with him.

1:12:33.680 --> 1:12:37.199
He had a particularly bad attack
of asthma.

1:12:37.200 --> 1:12:40.239
His heart gave out.
PHONE VIBRATING

1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:41.760
Poor love.

1:12:44.240 --> 1:12:46.959
He never really lived
much of a life.

1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:48.799
Excuse me for a minute.

1:12:48.800 --> 1:12:52.719
Branson. Yeah.
Yeah, go ahead, Nick.

1:12:52.720 --> 1:12:54.280
I'm so sorry for your loss.

1:12:56.560 --> 1:12:57.800
Biscuit?

1:12:59.440 --> 1:13:00.880
Thank you.

1:13:03.320 --> 1:13:05.159
Aha. OK.

1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:07.919
Yeah, thanks, all right, no problem.
I'll tell him.

1:13:07.920 --> 1:13:09.160
Bye-bye.

1:13:10.480 --> 1:13:14.359
So why would Social Services say
that Frederick's brother had died?

1:13:14.360 --> 1:13:16.119
It happens sometimes.

1:13:16.120 --> 1:13:18.519
Presumably because they didn't want
the Talbots to know

1:13:18.520 --> 1:13:20.799
that the boy they adopted
had a surviving twin.

1:13:20.800 --> 1:13:24.879
Desmond William Matthews.
Who grew up to be Kit Bishop.

1:13:24.880 --> 1:13:27.279
Bad luck.
It was a nice try, but listen...

1:13:27.280 --> 1:13:30.559
So, did somebody go to the trouble
of having plastic surgery

1:13:30.560 --> 1:13:34.519
to make themselves look like Bishop?
Somebody with an axe to grind maybe?

1:13:34.520 --> 1:13:40.199
No. Word just in - lab results
on DNA found at both crime scenes.

1:13:40.200 --> 1:13:43.519
They're a 100% match for Kit Bishop.

1:13:43.520 --> 1:13:45.680
Vosper wants us to charge him.

1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.319
The case against Bishop
is watertight.

1:13:53.320 --> 1:13:55.439
Whatever Julia Abbott
changed online,

1:13:55.440 --> 1:13:59.039
there's one thing nobody could
alter - that's Bishop's DNA results.

1:13:59.040 --> 1:14:02.999
Yeah. Glenn's gonna bring him in.
I've gotta see a man about a car.

1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:06.839
You're not sticking around?
No-one likes a sore loser, Roy.

1:14:06.840 --> 1:14:09.079
I just think it'd be best
for DS Branson

1:14:09.080 --> 1:14:11.919
to get back on the horse, ma'am.
OK.

1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:16.399
Well, how's he settling back in?
Yeah, he's, er... he's-he's fine.

1:14:16.400 --> 1:14:17.960
Ma'am.

1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:40.800
So how was it you and Skunk
went for that particular MG?

1:14:42.600 --> 1:14:44.639
We were just driving around
and we saw it.

1:14:44.640 --> 1:14:46.760
He'd been told to get an MG.

1:14:48.040 --> 1:14:50.479
So we followed the guy
until he parked up.

1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:52.839
And then we went past him
and round the corner.

1:14:52.840 --> 1:14:55.079
And then Skunk went back and...

1:14:55.080 --> 1:14:58.999
You followed it until
the guy parked up? What guy?

1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.240
It was parked outside
where it happened, wasn't it?

1:15:02.480 --> 1:15:03.879
No.

1:15:03.880 --> 1:15:06.279
We was driving around
looking for it.

1:15:06.280 --> 1:15:08.959
And then it just pulled out
of this alleyway.

1:15:08.960 --> 1:15:11.280
What alleyway, Bethany?

1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:19.439
Bella. Have we got anything on file
for a lock-up

1:15:19.440 --> 1:15:22.479
down an alley
near Waldegrave Villas?

1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:24.599
In connection with what?
I don't know yet,

1:15:24.600 --> 1:15:28.999
but there may be a link
to the sabotage of Cleo Morey's car.

1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:30.520
'Hang on.'

1:15:32.040 --> 1:15:35.759
I don't know about a lock-up, but
we've got a flag on an NH Jecks.

1:15:35.760 --> 1:15:37.160
Jecks?

1:15:39.280 --> 1:15:41.279
What's the flag?
'Wait a minute.'

1:15:41.280 --> 1:15:42.999
Erm...

1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.839
A tattoo parlour, maybe?

1:15:45.840 --> 1:15:48.959
How's that? We got a couple
of hundred hits on the ink

1:15:48.960 --> 1:15:51.159
used on Sophie Carrington's tatt.

1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:55.639
A batch was delivered
to 11A Waldegrave Villas.

1:15:55.640 --> 1:15:58.959
Well, it-it doesn't look much
like a tattoo parlour to me.

1:15:58.960 --> 1:16:00.439
'Well, that's what I've got.'

1:16:00.440 --> 1:16:03.960
NH Jecks, 11A, Waldegrave Villas.

1:16:12.040 --> 1:16:13.999
Can you organise a search warrant?

1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:16.439
And start a dig
into Jecks' background.

1:16:16.440 --> 1:16:20.999
I think there's a connection with
Roberta Vernon's freaks' roll-call.

1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:22.640
Will do.

1:18:13.240 --> 1:18:14.799
Pick up, pick up, pick up!

1:18:14.800 --> 1:18:16.680
PHONE VIBRATES

1:18:26.880 --> 1:18:29.039
PHONE RINGING OUT
Come on, come on.

1:18:29.040 --> 1:18:32.559
Roy? Cleo, put on the safety chain
and don't open the door

1:18:32.560 --> 1:18:35.359
until I'm with you.
Sure. What-what's going on?

1:18:35.360 --> 1:18:37.719
'I'm on my way.
I'll tell you when I'm there.'

1:18:37.720 --> 1:18:39.600
SHE FASTENS CHAIN

1:18:41.800 --> 1:18:43.800
MAN: That's very good advice.

1:18:48.800 --> 1:18:50.439
SHE PANTS

1:18:50.440 --> 1:18:51.720
SHE SHRIEKS

1:18:54.600 --> 1:18:56.440
DOORBELL

1:19:04.400 --> 1:19:05.640
Cleo!
RINGS DOORBELL

1:19:15.680 --> 1:19:17.200
Cleo.

1:19:24.440 --> 1:19:27.880
Cleo!
Roy, he's here! He's in the house!

1:20:05.360 --> 1:20:06.759
Requesting urgent assistance.

1:20:06.760 --> 1:20:09.159
In pursuit of suspect
on Ramwell Road.

1:20:09.160 --> 1:20:11.120
He's heading for the station.

1:21:18.320 --> 1:21:20.880
You called me an evil creature.

1:21:40.760 --> 1:21:42.239
HE WAILS

1:21:42.240 --> 1:21:45.640
HE BREATHES HEAVILY,
POLICE SIRENS APPROACH

1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:07.399
VOSPER:
We assumed twins, not triplets.

1:22:07.400 --> 1:22:09.640
Katya Bishop assumed
the same as we did.

1:22:10.920 --> 1:22:13.359
If she'd turned the page
in the registry,

1:22:13.360 --> 1:22:16.279
she'd have seen the entry
for the third brother.

1:22:16.280 --> 1:22:18.319
Jecks.

1:22:18.320 --> 1:22:22.159
He worked in the software department
at South Laines Assurance Company.

1:22:22.160 --> 1:22:27.039
He left three days after Bishop
took out life insurance on his wife.

1:22:27.040 --> 1:22:28.879
And Bishop's criminal record?

1:22:28.880 --> 1:22:33.799
Both offences were recorded
by Julia Abbott at Jecks' request.

1:22:33.800 --> 1:22:36.240
He was posing as Bishop
while involved with her.

1:22:38.080 --> 1:22:41.599
Why did he hate Bishop so much?
Jealousy, I suppose.

1:22:41.600 --> 1:22:43.959
Three babies were born -

1:22:43.960 --> 1:22:46.400
one died, one was saved
and one was damned.

1:22:47.400 --> 1:22:51.439
Freddie went to the Talbots.
He died of an asthma attack aged 21.

1:22:51.440 --> 1:22:57.079
Kit went to the Bishops, he led
a life of wealth and privilege.

1:22:57.080 --> 1:23:00.639
'And Norman Henry Jecks ended up
with an adoptive father

1:23:00.640 --> 1:23:04.120
'who should never have been within
a million miles of any child.'

1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:10.160
It was you... at the house.

1:23:11.960 --> 1:23:13.439
Not Bishop.

1:23:13.440 --> 1:23:16.799
"He," you said,
when I mentioned Bobbie Vernon.

1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:18.399
"He" not "she".

1:23:18.400 --> 1:23:21.039
Well, at least now, even you'll
be able to tell us apart.

1:23:21.040 --> 1:23:25.079
The joke is, that's how it started -
someone mistook me for him in a bar.

1:23:25.080 --> 1:23:26.719
You hadn't heard of him?
No.

1:23:26.720 --> 1:23:30.440
Only for some reason,
I found myself saying, "Yeah."

1:23:31.880 --> 1:23:33.919
I was Bishop.

1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:36.679
For the rest of the night,
I never put my hand in my pocket.

1:23:36.680 --> 1:23:40.279
So you had no idea
you had a brother?

1:23:40.280 --> 1:23:41.320
None.

1:23:42.360 --> 1:23:44.839
I thought I was Arthur Jecks'
only natural son.

1:23:44.840 --> 1:23:46.320
"Natural."

1:23:48.160 --> 1:23:50.439
Oh, I had a younger sister.

1:23:50.440 --> 1:23:52.240
Least that's what they called her.

1:23:54.080 --> 1:23:56.399
She was my little light
in the darkness.

1:23:56.400 --> 1:24:01.240
I thought, "At least if he's doing
it to me, he's not doing it to her."

1:24:04.800 --> 1:24:09.799
It wasn't till later on I realised
that he did it to all the other boys

1:24:09.800 --> 1:24:13.879
and girls that came through
the house - his foster children.

1:24:13.880 --> 1:24:16.399
Now, he really was an evil creature,

1:24:16.400 --> 1:24:18.959
so you'll see why
I might take exception

1:24:18.960 --> 1:24:21.080
to being compared
to someone like that.

1:24:23.400 --> 1:24:26.440
I always knew something was missing,
some...

1:24:29.280 --> 1:24:31.519
..piece of me, but...

1:24:31.520 --> 1:24:34.479
it wasn't until someone
took me for Bishop

1:24:34.480 --> 1:24:41.039
that I started looking into it
and I realised I'd been adopted.

1:24:41.040 --> 1:24:42.800
So you contacted him?

1:24:44.080 --> 1:24:45.759
Tried to.

1:24:45.760 --> 1:24:47.599
No, I wrote him a letter
to his company.

1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:50.079
I just got a curt letter back
from his legal department,

1:24:50.080 --> 1:24:53.720
warning me they'd take action if
I ever tried to contact him again.

1:24:54.840 --> 1:24:57.800
Legal action.
His own flesh and blood.

1:24:59.640 --> 1:25:01.959
I didn't want anything from him.

1:25:01.960 --> 1:25:04.600
Yeah. Not that he couldn't spare it.

1:25:05.760 --> 1:25:06.840
Is that why you did it?

1:25:08.360 --> 1:25:10.879
Well, I thought, if he won't share
what he has with me,

1:25:10.880 --> 1:25:12.520
I'll share what I have with him.

1:25:15.240 --> 1:25:16.280
The pain.

1:25:18.640 --> 1:25:19.960
The fear.

1:25:22.800 --> 1:25:26.720
But it was Katya you killed.
His wife.

1:25:27.960 --> 1:25:31.080
And Sophie Carrington.
They'd never done you any harm.

1:25:32.360 --> 1:25:34.360
You don't get it, do you?

1:25:37.360 --> 1:25:40.200
If you want to hurt someone,
you don't kill them.

1:25:42.640 --> 1:25:44.240
You kill the thing they love.

1:25:47.920 --> 1:25:49.480
My father taught me that.

1:25:59.200 --> 1:26:01.479
KIT: 'Jecks is no more my brother
than you are.'

1:26:01.480 --> 1:26:03.960
Family's not just DNA. Is it?

1:26:05.640 --> 1:26:08.239
Well, hopefully, he'll be going
to a place where no-one

1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:10.719
will ever see him again.
I'll see him.

1:26:10.720 --> 1:26:14.039
Every day.
I will wake up, look in the mirror,

1:26:14.040 --> 1:26:16.399
and see the man
who killed the woman I loved.

1:26:16.400 --> 1:26:19.599
And the worst of it is
that she died thinking it was me.

1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:21.680
That's the last thing she saw.

1:26:24.080 --> 1:26:25.880
My face.

1:26:26.920 --> 1:26:28.480
But not your eyes.

1:26:29.800 --> 1:26:33.199
I've seen Jecks' face, Mr Bishop,
I've seen it close up.

1:26:33.200 --> 1:26:34.520
The fury.

1:26:35.720 --> 1:26:38.439
I doubt that you've ever looked
at anyone like that,

1:26:38.440 --> 1:26:40.480
certainly not your wife.

1:26:41.760 --> 1:26:44.599
She wouldn't have recognised
that face as yours.

1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:48.000
Some small part of her,
even at the end...

1:26:49.760 --> 1:26:51.960
..she would've known
that that wasn't you.

1:27:02.840 --> 1:27:05.199
OK. I'm gonna head off.

1:27:05.200 --> 1:27:07.040
How's Cleo?

1:27:09.120 --> 1:27:11.920
As well as can be expected,
in the circumstances.

1:27:13.280 --> 1:27:15.959
She's, er... she's nice.

1:27:15.960 --> 1:27:18.199
Yeah, I think so.

1:27:18.200 --> 1:27:22.039
Oh, come on, Roy.
You don't give much away, do you?

1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:24.919
Well, you know what?
I think it's good.

1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:27.960
And for what it's worth...
so does Ari.

1:27:29.200 --> 1:27:32.000
You told Ari? Only that
you'd gone for a drink, sure.

1:27:33.160 --> 1:27:36.680
Look, you know we both loved Sandy,
right?

1:27:37.800 --> 1:27:39.879
But we love you, too.

1:27:39.880 --> 1:27:42.559
It's OK to move on.

1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:46.600
Look, you are doing nothing
against Sandy's memory.

1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:52.880
I'll see you tomorrow.

1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:03.280
CLEO: 'It's just until
I get my place straight.'

1:28:04.840 --> 1:28:06.999
Yeah, I know, I know.

1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:12.999
Well, I'll have the spare room
and you can have mine.

1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:15.200
Don't think that was the plan,
was it?

1:28:17.320 --> 1:28:18.640
There was a plan?

1:28:19.800 --> 1:28:21.080
Oh, yeah.

1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:29.400
Oh, yeah.

1:28:30.960 --> 1:28:32.559
OK.

1:28:32.560 --> 1:28:34.240
Whatever you say.
SHE CHUCKLES

1:28:41.800 --> 1:28:44.400
