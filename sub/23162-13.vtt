00:00.084 --> 00:03.351
Welcome to Jonathan Quayle Higgins'
lnstitute for the Criminally Adolescent.

00:03.421 --> 00:06.390
Hut! Two! Three!
Hut! Two! Three!

00:06.457 --> 00:08.652
You're Thomas Magnum?
The one and only.

00:09.026 --> 00:11.426
You're so young.
Come from a family of slow agers.

00:11.495 --> 00:15.556
He's impersonating me! I don't care
whether he's Robin's nephew or not.

00:15.633 --> 00:18.033
He's gonna be one sorry kid
when he walks in here.

00:18.135 --> 00:20.433
Being a private investigator
is not a game.

00:20.504 --> 00:23.496
It takes years of training.
Hundreds of hours of study.

00:23.574 --> 00:24.802
I'd like to report
a homicide.

00:26.010 --> 00:27.238
You stay there!

00:27.311 --> 00:28.300
Mine!

04:00.689 --> 04:01.986
Hey, what the hell...

04:10.866 --> 04:11.798
Wallace?

04:20.075 --> 04:21.838
Hold your fire.

04:38.394 --> 04:42.023
Sometimes a little bit
of a shock is a good thing.

04:42.097 --> 04:43.291
Well, maybe not a shock,

04:43.365 --> 04:45.629
but at least
some kind of a change.

04:45.701 --> 04:47.498
For instance,
the last couple of months for me

04:47.569 --> 04:51.335
have been a monotony of insurance
investigations and divorce cases.

04:51.407 --> 04:55.707
Basically, boring tedium relieved
only by a missing cat case.

04:55.778 --> 04:57.439
But that's another story.

04:57.513 --> 05:00.107
Suffice to say,
a change was in order.

05:04.053 --> 05:05.816
You are one hour late.

05:06.155 --> 05:08.885
I trust you have
a satisfactory explanation.

05:08.991 --> 05:12.324
R.J.: Heavy traffic, man.

05:14.563 --> 05:18.124
A simple, "No excuses, sir,"
will suffice.

05:21.170 --> 05:23.297
No excuses, sir.

05:24.139 --> 05:26.573
Man, the plane was late.

05:28.410 --> 05:30.503
But that's an excuse, sir.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.908
A feeble one, at best, R.J.

05:34.817 --> 05:37.718
By the by, where did you
get this vehicle?

05:37.786 --> 05:40.311
You need wheels, man. Sir.

05:41.723 --> 05:44.089
No, it's Uncle Robin's.

05:44.159 --> 05:46.525
It was waiting for me
at the airport, sir.

05:46.962 --> 05:49.954
Well, I doubt that you'll
get much usage out of it.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.259
Huh?

05:51.333 --> 05:53.198
No, not much at all.

05:53.335 --> 05:56.133
For we both know
why you are here.

05:59.441 --> 06:04.037
I am quite aware of the unusual
circumstances regarding your background.

06:05.647 --> 06:09.105
I am also aware that you were
known at school, all of them,

06:09.284 --> 06:12.720
to be undisciplined and quite
laggardly in all endeavors.

06:14.523 --> 06:19.085
Nevertheless, your uncle, Mr. Masters,
feels that you can be transformed

06:19.828 --> 06:22.956
under my guidance
by your 21st birthday

06:24.199 --> 06:28.727
into a gentleman worthy of
his considerable trust fund.

06:29.171 --> 06:32.937
So any thoughts you may have of
a summer's vacation in paradise

06:33.008 --> 06:35.033
should be done away
with straightaway.

06:35.944 --> 06:39.710
For you are about to embark upon
an academic and physical regimen

06:39.781 --> 06:43.273
comparable to the finest
military academies in the world.

06:43.352 --> 06:45.582
Do I make myself clear?

06:55.030 --> 06:56.930
R.J.: All right.

07:04.239 --> 07:05.763
Magnum.

07:06.175 --> 07:08.871
You were supposed to be
here this morning to meet...

07:08.944 --> 07:10.912
R.J. Masters. The new recruit.

07:10.979 --> 07:14.745
Welcome to the Jonathan Quayle Higgins
lnstitute for the Criminally Adolescent.

07:14.816 --> 07:17.011
I'm Thomas Magnum.
- Where have you been?

07:17.085 --> 07:18.848
Yeah, I know,
I know, really...

07:18.921 --> 07:20.786
You know?
Sure.

07:20.856 --> 07:23.825
Lives in the guest house.
World class private investigator.

07:23.892 --> 07:26.725
Hardly world class.
I'm waiting for an explanation.

07:26.795 --> 07:29.161
No explanation.
I was out all night.

07:29.231 --> 07:31.324
On a case.
On a case, huh?

07:31.400 --> 07:33.391
After I unpack,
you and l, we can...

07:33.468 --> 07:35.698
Silence. You and Magnum
will do nothing of the sort.

07:35.771 --> 07:38.205
You and I will discuss
your future agenda.

07:38.273 --> 07:41.970
Agenda? It sounds like an induction
ceremony. When does he get his hair cut?

07:42.044 --> 07:44.638
Come on, Higgins, lighten up a
little bit. The kid just got here.

07:44.713 --> 07:47.705
No, no, no, it's okay. I don't
want to get off on the wrong foot.

07:47.783 --> 07:51.344
Mr. Higgins here is just
doing what we all agreed to.

07:51.420 --> 07:55.254
Look, I know you're gonna to be putting
a lot of time and energy into me,

07:55.324 --> 07:58.384
and I just want you to know
I appreciate it.

07:58.594 --> 07:59.925
Really.

07:59.995 --> 08:01.724
Thank you, R.J.

08:02.130 --> 08:05.725
Perhaps the task won't be as
difficult as I had envisioned.

08:06.335 --> 08:08.803
Come along,
and I'll show you to your quarters.

08:08.870 --> 08:12.636
I am sure, Magnum,
that you have things to do.

08:15.877 --> 08:17.367
I...

09:00.322 --> 09:02.347
Hut! Two! Three! Four!

09:02.424 --> 09:04.483
Hut! Two! Three! Four!

09:04.559 --> 09:06.527
Hut! Two! Three! Four!

09:06.595 --> 09:08.529
Hut! Two! Three! Four!

09:08.597 --> 09:11.191
Proceed to
the next procedure now.

09:12.301 --> 09:16.294
One, two, three, four...

09:18.974 --> 09:21.033
Obviously my assumption
was correct.

09:21.109 --> 09:24.670
You've never had a single moment
of exercise in your entire life.

09:24.746 --> 09:26.680
I'm just a little
out of shape.

09:26.748 --> 09:28.045
That's all.

09:28.116 --> 09:30.641
"I'm just a little
out of shape, sir."

09:30.719 --> 09:32.619
Funny, you don't look it.

09:33.088 --> 09:38.116
Showing proper respect for authority
is the mark of a gentleman, young man.

09:38.193 --> 09:42.823
Oh, come on, Higgins. Do we have to keep
playing this stupid game all the time?

09:42.898 --> 09:44.923
Your future is not a game.

09:46.968 --> 09:49.596
I'm just a little
out of shape, sir.

09:49.671 --> 09:53.072
Very well. Now I want you to culminate
this morning's physical activities

09:53.141 --> 09:55.006
with 20 circuits
around the estate perimeter.

09:55.077 --> 09:56.567
Circuits? You mean laps?

09:56.645 --> 09:58.977
I have to do 20 laps...
Twenty-two circuits.

09:59.047 --> 10:00.878
What?
Twenty-five circuits.

10:00.949 --> 10:04.385
Okay, okay.
I get the picture, sir.

10:58.306 --> 10:59.898
Mr. Magnum?

11:12.587 --> 11:15.078
Mr. Magnum?

12:02.070 --> 12:04.061
Hello?
- Mr. Magnum,

12:05.240 --> 12:06.969
my name is Charla Graham.

12:07.042 --> 12:09.567
Agatha Chumley suggested
I contact you.

12:09.678 --> 12:11.407
I need your help.

12:12.414 --> 12:14.245
Hello? Are you there?

12:14.883 --> 12:17.647
Yeah. Yeah, I'm right here.

12:17.752 --> 12:20.346
My husband was murdered
two weeks ago,

12:20.489 --> 12:24.220
and I'd like you to find the man
who can identify the killers.

12:24.459 --> 12:26.256
Please, will you help me?

12:26.328 --> 12:27.556
Mr. Magnum?

12:27.762 --> 12:30.458
Yeah. I got
a bad connection.

12:30.532 --> 12:31.999
I need a new phone.

12:32.067 --> 12:33.364
When can we meet?

12:33.435 --> 12:34.459
Meet?

12:34.536 --> 12:36.094
To discuss the case.

12:36.204 --> 12:39.765
Oh, yeah, the case.
Of course, the case.

12:40.208 --> 12:43.109
Well, I know you like
the King Kamehameha Club.

12:43.178 --> 12:44.666
Say 4:00 this afternoon?

12:44.804 --> 12:45.661
Great.

12:45.760 --> 12:48.558
I'll see you then.
And thank you.

12:56.613 --> 12:57.807
Thank you.

13:18.262 --> 13:20.628
Taking a nap
in the middle of the day,

13:20.698 --> 13:24.293
despite what Higgins thinks,
isn't my usual M.O.

13:24.401 --> 13:26.266
Especially when I'm working.

13:26.337 --> 13:29.101
But I've got to confess
I wasn't really working.

13:29.173 --> 13:32.939
Even the insurance investigations
and the divorce cases were drying up.

13:33.010 --> 13:36.468
And there were no more
missing cat cases either.

13:37.147 --> 13:40.981
Just a late-night poker game with
Rick, T. C. and a couple of other guys

13:41.051 --> 13:43.349
who always seemed to win.

13:49.727 --> 13:50.716
Ah!

13:52.363 --> 13:54.763
Hello,
Mr. Magnum, it's me again.

13:54.865 --> 13:59.097
I'm going to be a little late.
I think they're following me.

14:00.738 --> 14:03.070
Thomas, Rick.
Louie says you've got till tonight

14:03.140 --> 14:06.041
to pay him the thirteen
bucks from the game. Bye.

14:22.226 --> 14:26.026
That's a great trick, kid, but
you think you're gonna get away with it?

14:26.096 --> 14:29.862
I don't know. I just hope he
doesn't notice that it's gone.

14:30.401 --> 14:33.302
Getting back in,
that's the problem.

14:33.370 --> 14:35.167
Higgins will understand.

14:35.239 --> 14:37.173
He seems like
a nice enough chap.

14:37.241 --> 14:40.267
Except when he's mad,
which is just about all the time.

14:43.113 --> 14:45.138
Well, I take my chances.

14:46.850 --> 14:49.318
Do you mind if
I have another beer?

14:49.420 --> 14:53.151
R.J., how old are you?

14:53.891 --> 14:55.358
Twenty-seven.
Twenty...

14:55.426 --> 14:57.394
Twenty-seven?
What, are you kiddin' or what?

14:57.461 --> 14:59.793
For Robin Masters' nephew,
it is on the house.

14:59.863 --> 15:02.457
In fact, the house is on the house.
All right.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.693
Rick,
you're a heck of a guy.

15:10.808 --> 15:12.935
Listen, it was great
meeting you, really.

15:13.010 --> 15:17.037
Thanks for the drink
and see you guys later.

15:17.581 --> 15:19.515
I guess the kid's been
cooped up too long.

15:19.583 --> 15:21.073
He's got to kind of unwind.

15:22.186 --> 15:24.780
Charla Graham?
Yes.

15:27.324 --> 15:29.849
She looks a little old for him.
I mean, if you ask me.

15:29.927 --> 15:32.054
Hey, he's 27.
What's wrong with that?

15:32.963 --> 15:35.830
You're Thomas Magnum?
The one and only.

15:36.300 --> 15:38.530
Why? Something wrong?

15:39.269 --> 15:42.136
No. It's just that you're so young.
I mean...

15:42.206 --> 15:44.003
It's hereditary.

15:44.074 --> 15:46.099
Come from a family
of slow agers.

15:47.544 --> 15:50.104
But about the case?

15:50.180 --> 15:52.705
This is a snapshot
that we took last summer.

15:52.783 --> 15:55.308
This is Archie. I'll show it
to you.

15:56.220 --> 15:58.211
Rick. Telephone.

15:58.288 --> 16:00.449
Oh, thanks.

16:06.096 --> 16:07.085
Yeah.

16:07.297 --> 16:09.128
Hi, Rick. How's it going?

16:09.199 --> 16:11.599
What do mean,
"Hi, Rick. How's it going?"

16:11.669 --> 16:14.229
Well, that's just
a figure of speech.

16:14.304 --> 16:15.464
What's happening?

16:15.539 --> 16:17.973
What do you mean,
"What's happening?"

16:18.042 --> 16:20.806
Well, I mean, you know,

16:20.878 --> 16:24.905
has anybody kind of been
around there asking for me?

16:25.015 --> 16:26.448
You got it, pally.

16:26.517 --> 16:27.916
It sounded like a client?

16:27.985 --> 16:30.977
Look, you're not going to
weasel out of it that way.

16:31.055 --> 16:34.252
"I'll pay up just as soon as I get
the case." Well, it's not gonna work.

16:34.324 --> 16:37.384
That story has been told too many times.
Now, you listen to me.

16:37.461 --> 16:40.294
Louie wants
his $13 by tonight,

16:40.364 --> 16:43.299
and so does Gino.
He wants his $36 by tonight.

16:43.367 --> 16:45.835
And if you think that I'm
gonna stall them, you're crazy.

16:45.903 --> 16:47.734
You just find yourself
another patsy.

16:52.509 --> 16:53.498
Mmm-hmm.

16:59.349 --> 17:01.476
Frankly, I'm impressed.

17:02.419 --> 17:03.408
Thank you.

17:03.487 --> 17:07.787
Well, this should be enough to get a
good start on finding your neighbor.

17:08.025 --> 17:12.051
He's got a pretty recognizable
face and it's a small island.

17:12.429 --> 17:16.661
But Archie's into real estate, you know.
He's got condos, houses, developments.

17:16.733 --> 17:19.464
He could be hiding out
almost anywhere.

17:19.837 --> 17:21.098
I'll find him.

17:21.171 --> 17:22.798
I swear.

17:23.406 --> 17:24.896
Thanks.

17:28.377 --> 17:31.779
Don't forget to use that new number I
gave you. I disconnected the old phone.

17:31.849 --> 17:33.976
Okay. Thank you.

17:36.520 --> 17:38.385
Bye-bye.

17:46.096 --> 17:47.825
Thanks a lot.

17:59.243 --> 18:00.471
Private eye?

18:00.577 --> 18:02.169
It seems to look that way.

18:02.246 --> 18:03.577
Well, what are we gonna do?

18:03.647 --> 18:06.377
We let him take us
to the witness.

18:06.717 --> 18:08.548
Be discreet, kid.

19:58.328 --> 19:59.693
Better take a rain check.

20:07.804 --> 20:10.671
My patience has
reached the breaking point.

20:12.109 --> 20:14.634
Young man,
you are hereby on report

20:14.711 --> 20:18.203
and any further episodes such as
this will be dealt with severely.

20:18.282 --> 20:21.376
As it is, you should consider yourself
lucky that all you are suffering

20:21.451 --> 20:24.716
are extra sessions of ancient Greek
history and double calisthenics.

20:24.788 --> 20:26.278
Double calisthenics?

20:26.356 --> 20:27.880
And forfeiture
of your car keys.

20:27.958 --> 20:30.222
That is my Ferrari.

20:30.294 --> 20:31.852
"That's my Ferrari, sir."

20:31.929 --> 20:34.625
That is my Ferrari, sir!

20:34.698 --> 20:37.326
No, it's not!
It's Mr. Masters' Ferrari.

20:37.401 --> 20:39.528
Sounds real familiar.

20:40.871 --> 20:43.135
Get used to it, R.J.
He loves saying that.

20:43.206 --> 20:46.334
I trust there is some compelling
reason for this interruption, Magnum.

20:46.410 --> 20:48.071
If not...
There is.

20:48.145 --> 20:49.476
At least I think there is.
What?

20:49.546 --> 20:51.946
I don't know.
Magnum, you are wasting my time

20:52.015 --> 20:54.006
and R.J.'s time.
And believe me, this lad needs

20:54.084 --> 20:56.075
all the time from me
he can get.

20:56.153 --> 20:57.518
Hey, I'm gone.

20:57.587 --> 20:59.020
There's just one thing.
I just wondered

20:59.089 --> 21:01.956
if somebody had been trying
to get a hold of me here.

21:02.292 --> 21:05.750
I mean, see, I think someone
either thinks I'm on a case,

21:05.829 --> 21:10.459
or wants me for their case, or is in
some kind of trouble, or they just...

21:10.667 --> 21:12.601
Never mind.

21:13.570 --> 21:15.504
Probably a wrong number.

21:15.572 --> 21:17.403
She did mention
my name, though.

21:17.474 --> 21:20.238
Magnum, I assure you,
no one has called here asking for you.

21:20.310 --> 21:21.834
And furthermore
your sordid social life

21:21.912 --> 21:23.402
has no place
in this classroom.

21:23.480 --> 21:26.813
Please leave. Okay, okay.
I just thought I'd ask.

21:27.551 --> 21:29.143
I'll check around.

21:30.187 --> 21:32.553
Except she sounded
real desperate.

21:32.622 --> 21:35.750
I'm sure if she called you,
she was.

21:38.695 --> 21:39.889
I'll see you, R.J.

21:46.436 --> 21:49.234
With him here, obviously my
task will be doubly difficult.

21:50.507 --> 21:53.943
However, if I ever impart any lasting
and profound knowledge to you, R.J.,

21:54.011 --> 21:56.002
the most important is,
never,

21:56.179 --> 22:01.549
never become unfocused, diffused,
directionless, hedonistic, lazy...

22:03.320 --> 22:04.651
Now, where were we?

22:08.759 --> 22:10.522
The Trojan War.

22:11.595 --> 22:13.324
Oh, yes. Of course.

22:19.269 --> 22:21.430
As I was saying,

22:21.505 --> 22:24.770
some legends have Athena herself
building the Trojan horse.

22:25.042 --> 22:27.010
However it was fashioned,

22:27.077 --> 22:28.772
the Trojans arose
that morning to find

22:28.845 --> 22:31.370
that the entire siege
had been lifted,

22:31.448 --> 22:33.780
and the only object
that remained at their gate

22:33.850 --> 22:36.114
was this enormous
wooden horse.

22:36.553 --> 22:37.918
Naturally...

22:43.126 --> 22:44.218
Hello.

22:44.294 --> 22:47.024
Hello, Rick.

22:47.397 --> 22:48.659
It's Thomas here.

22:48.732 --> 22:49.926
Thomas?

22:50.000 --> 22:52.195
Yeah, I just got back
from the dentist.

22:52.269 --> 22:54.066
Yeah. Look,
I need a big favor.

22:54.137 --> 22:56.628
I'm working on
a very important case

22:57.307 --> 22:58.934
and I've only got one lead.

22:59.009 --> 23:00.237
One lead.

23:00.310 --> 23:03.473
Yeah, it's an '84 Firebird,

23:03.747 --> 23:06.215
Iicense plate number

23:07.617 --> 23:10.108
NLR 315.

23:10.554 --> 23:13.182
Think you can trace it for me?
Well, it depends.

23:13.256 --> 23:16.054
Come on, I'll pay my tab
in full. Promise.

23:16.126 --> 23:17.320
I don't know. It's...

23:17.394 --> 23:18.486
With interest?

23:18.562 --> 23:22.931
Look, Rick, these bozos
are playing real rough.

23:23.633 --> 23:25.157
I need you to help me out.

23:25.235 --> 23:26.896
Well, why didn't you
say so before, pally?

23:26.970 --> 23:28.403
I'll tell you what.
I'll get right on it.

23:28.472 --> 23:30.963
Great, buddy,
I'll be over in a bit. Thanks.

23:37.380 --> 23:38.711
Who was that?

23:38.782 --> 23:40.511
That was you, Thomas.

24:36.373 --> 24:38.432
Come, lads, patrol.

25:05.368 --> 25:08.394
If you would have played like this last night,
you wouldn't have lost so much money.

25:08.471 --> 25:10.530
How could he do that?
Who, Gino or Louie?

25:10.607 --> 25:12.666
You know, I bet that they
were signaling each other...

25:12.742 --> 25:14.767
I'm talking about R.J.

25:14.844 --> 25:16.607
Oh, he's just young
and impetuous.

25:16.680 --> 25:19.205
He's impersonating me!
Well, you got a point there.

25:19.282 --> 25:22.979
Look, some woman is out there in danger,
thinking I'm protecting her.

25:23.053 --> 25:25.521
I don't care whether he's
Robin's nephew or not.

25:25.589 --> 25:28.649
He's gonna be one sorry kid
when he walks in here.

25:28.725 --> 25:31.523
And another thing...

25:34.397 --> 25:36.262
Hello. Yeah.

25:37.067 --> 25:39.001
Wow, you're kidding me.

25:39.069 --> 25:41.264
Yeah, I'll let him know.

25:42.505 --> 25:44.302
Try antibiotics.

25:47.744 --> 25:49.006
That was lce Pick.

25:49.079 --> 25:52.173
He said that that license is registered
to a couple of local hit men.

25:52.249 --> 25:53.511
Gin.

26:06.830 --> 26:08.627
Your friend was right.

26:08.698 --> 26:11.030
There's only one P I.
on this island who drives a Ferrari.

26:11.101 --> 26:12.796
Thomas Magnum.

26:25.315 --> 26:27.545
Can I borrow your phone?

26:28.218 --> 26:29.549
He made us.

26:29.619 --> 26:30.984
Unfortunately.

26:31.121 --> 26:33.089
What are we gonna do?

26:33.156 --> 26:34.987
Take him out.

26:35.058 --> 26:36.650
Yeah, hello, police.

26:36.726 --> 26:38.921
I'd like to report
a homicide.

26:41.364 --> 26:42.490
Mine!

26:44.968 --> 26:47.664
I'd swear those are gunshots.
Those are gunshots.

26:56.179 --> 26:57.544
Don't move!

26:59.449 --> 27:02.418
Nowhere to go, Magnum.
Except with us.

27:03.853 --> 27:05.047
I'm not Magnum.

27:05.121 --> 27:06.588
I'm Magnum.

27:09.426 --> 27:10.825
He is!

27:13.730 --> 27:14.992
You stay there!

27:15.065 --> 27:16.327
R.J.: No problem.

27:25.875 --> 27:28.810
I can explain everything.

27:34.116 --> 27:36.914
You stole my case!
R.J.: No, no, no.

27:37.686 --> 27:39.278
I borrowed it. Kind of.

27:39.354 --> 27:41.481
You stole it!

27:42.157 --> 27:45.615
Hey, can I stop?
'Cause I'm gonna die.

27:45.694 --> 27:48.356
Don't change the subject.
You sneaked into my room.

27:48.430 --> 27:50.091
No, I didn't sneak.
The door was open.

27:50.165 --> 27:51.894
And took my call
from my client

27:51.967 --> 27:54.162
while I was sleeping.
Why?

27:56.671 --> 27:58.798
I didn't...
I didn't plan it that way, you know.

27:58.874 --> 28:01.707
I mean, I was just hoping that
you could show me some ropes.

28:02.911 --> 28:04.879
Resume running.

28:05.113 --> 28:06.910
Resume running!

28:06.982 --> 28:08.381
No!
No!

28:08.617 --> 28:11.142
I'm not showing you
any ropes.

28:11.553 --> 28:14.317
There were guys shooting at me!
Good.

28:14.389 --> 28:16.448
Well, don't I deserve
some explanation?

28:16.525 --> 28:19.119
I mean, it was me who traced
down that license number.

28:19.194 --> 28:20.252
That was Rick.

28:20.328 --> 28:23.957
R.J., the guys in the Firebird
were professional hit men.

28:24.032 --> 28:26.159
Being a private investigator
is not a game.

28:26.234 --> 28:29.931
It takes years of training.
Hundreds of hours of study.

28:31.306 --> 28:33.797
Well, I don't have
a lot of years.

28:33.909 --> 28:35.274
Why?

28:36.678 --> 28:38.646
Because I'll be too old.

28:40.348 --> 28:44.842
Tom, look, I'm almost 21. I mean,
I think my hair is going already.

28:44.920 --> 28:49.186
The only thing that's going
is your mind and my patience.

28:49.257 --> 28:51.191
And if you don't
start running again,

28:51.259 --> 28:55.355
all the conning in the world is not
going to stop Higgins from phoning Robin

28:55.430 --> 28:56.897
and pronouncing
you a failure.

28:56.965 --> 29:00.264
Then you'll be back at another boarding
school, or out in the streets alone.

29:00.335 --> 29:02.826
No, Higgins wouldn't do that.
Why?

29:03.138 --> 29:06.699
Because he's afraid that Robin
will think that he's a failure.

29:07.509 --> 29:09.773
I'll make the call then!

29:09.845 --> 29:13.804
You just get back to work!
Do your job and I'll do mine!

29:14.015 --> 29:16.006
If I have a client left.

29:16.585 --> 29:18.280
You mean, we?

29:18.620 --> 29:20.713
I mean, me!

29:20.822 --> 29:22.813
Okay, okay, okay.

29:24.893 --> 29:27.487
Now, you're out of the picture,
you understand?

29:28.964 --> 29:32.832
I want your solemn word
that you will not meddle.

29:34.603 --> 29:37.231
I promise. Solemnly.

29:38.206 --> 29:40.003
Good, then

29:40.442 --> 29:42.307
resume running.

29:42.377 --> 29:45.346
I thought we said no.
I said no.

29:48.149 --> 29:49.673
I can't believe this.

29:52.454 --> 29:54.081
I should have known
he wasn't you.

29:54.689 --> 29:58.853
I mean, I should have wised up when
he gave me that line about slow agers.

30:00.228 --> 30:01.786
How could you do it?

30:01.863 --> 30:04.491
How could you let that kid go
around masquerading as you?

30:04.566 --> 30:07.034
He didn't bother to ask my
permission, Mrs. Graham.

30:07.102 --> 30:08.433
I'm sorry.

30:08.503 --> 30:11.370
It's just that this seems like
it's been such a waste of time.

30:11.439 --> 30:15.603
I'm no closer to finding Archie or
my husband's killers than I ever was.

30:15.677 --> 30:17.907
Do you have any idea why
your husband was killed?

30:17.979 --> 30:19.742
A very good one.

30:19.814 --> 30:23.113
Wallace was supposed to
testify at a trial next week.

30:23.585 --> 30:25.780
Union racketeering and fraud.

30:26.321 --> 30:30.519
He was an accountant with a
local and he saw too much.

30:30.592 --> 30:32.219
I warned him not to do it,

30:32.294 --> 30:34.353
but he insisted on testifying.

30:34.429 --> 30:36.420
He said he wouldn't
have it any other way.

30:36.498 --> 30:39.023
Can you tell me anything else
about your neighbor, Archie Fleming?

30:39.100 --> 30:41.295
I told you he was
in real estate.

30:41.369 --> 30:44.668
No, you told R.J.

30:45.040 --> 30:48.066
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm confused.

30:48.743 --> 30:51.439
But l... I did show you
the picture, right?

30:52.080 --> 30:55.880
No, you showed that to R.J. also,
but I have it now.

30:57.052 --> 30:59.816
Because this morning I remembered
where that picture was taken.

30:59.888 --> 31:01.788
At a party at one
of Archie's houses.

31:01.856 --> 31:03.721
How many does he have?

31:04.025 --> 31:06.323
Plenty. I've been doing
some research.

31:06.394 --> 31:08.123
Am I gonna need a list?

31:08.897 --> 31:10.797
Well, this house
is at Makapuu Point.

31:10.865 --> 31:13.333
And he used to go there
sometimes on weekends.

31:13.401 --> 31:15.028
Do you remember the address?

31:15.103 --> 31:16.866
No. But it's the only
one there.

31:18.840 --> 31:20.501
Well, that's a start.

31:20.709 --> 31:22.939
But before you leave,
you better give me all of them.

31:23.011 --> 31:25.002
You know, houses,
condos, developments.

31:25.080 --> 31:27.048
Got a pen?

31:45.600 --> 31:47.534
Higgins.

32:15.597 --> 32:17.224
R.J.?

32:20.702 --> 32:23.170
R.J., I'd like a word
with you.

32:24.506 --> 32:26.667
Open this door at once.

32:52.367 --> 32:55.564
Because this morning I
remembered where that picture was taken.

32:55.637 --> 32:57.867
At a party at one
of Archie's houses.

32:57.939 --> 32:59.804
How many does he have?

33:00.341 --> 33:02.673
Plenty. I've been doing
some research.

33:02.744 --> 33:05.144
Am I going to need a list?

33:05.213 --> 33:07.147
Well, this house
is at Makapuu Point.

33:07.215 --> 33:09.775
And he used to go there
sometimes on weekends.

33:09.851 --> 33:11.318
Do you remember the address?

33:11.386 --> 33:13.980
No, but it's
the only one there.

33:15.090 --> 33:17.422
Oh, my God.

33:18.993 --> 33:20.392
I don't believe this.

33:20.462 --> 33:21.656
Please, don't worry,
Mrs. Graham,

33:21.729 --> 33:22.957
Agatha did not
mislead you.

33:23.031 --> 33:24.726
Magnum is very good
at what he does.

33:24.799 --> 33:26.960
Thank you.
When he knows what he's doing.

33:27.035 --> 33:29.799
I don't know what he's doing.
I don't even know who's who anymore.

33:29.871 --> 33:31.668
When this is over, Higgins,
I want him gone.

33:31.739 --> 33:34.071
Quite. However, in view
of the fact that R.J. is,

33:34.142 --> 33:35.632
in all probability,
exceeding the speed limit,

33:35.710 --> 33:38.406
I suggest that you
step on it, too.

33:43.384 --> 33:45.875
You know, this has all
been like a nightmare.

33:45.954 --> 33:49.685
I assure you, Mrs. Graham,
everything will turn out all right.

34:01.402 --> 34:02.733
I hope.

34:03.972 --> 34:05.940
I'm afraid
you're history, punk.

34:06.541 --> 34:09.304
They should never have
sent a boy to do a man's job.

34:09.377 --> 34:11.139
R.J.: Listen, Archie.

34:11.246 --> 34:12.873
You got it wrong here.

34:13.081 --> 34:14.241
Wrong?

34:14.549 --> 34:18.007
Wrong? Listen,
you came here to kill me.

34:18.987 --> 34:21.080
You came here
to blow me away.

34:21.156 --> 34:23.021
But you're not.

34:23.091 --> 34:26.549
No. This is gonna be
self-defense.

34:26.728 --> 34:29.561
Yeah, yeah, self-defense.

34:29.697 --> 34:32.427
No.
You gotta listen to me.

34:32.500 --> 34:35.594
'Cause...
Don't... Don't shoot.

34:35.670 --> 34:38.661
I'm not working
for the hit men.

34:41.141 --> 34:43.770
Please believe me.

34:44.344 --> 34:46.643
All right. Let's find out.

34:46.714 --> 34:48.237
Come on, up against the wall.

34:48.315 --> 34:51.308
What? Come on,
up against the wall. Spread 'em.

34:54.054 --> 34:56.683
Don't do that.
You tickled me.

34:56.891 --> 34:59.985
Look, Mr. Fleming,
I'm not a murderer.

35:00.061 --> 35:02.655
I'm just a kid.
I don't even own a gun.

35:03.164 --> 35:04.188
Oh.

35:04.265 --> 35:06.028
I don't want to die.

35:06.100 --> 35:08.295
Well, what do you
want me to do?

35:08.369 --> 35:10.769
How about just putting
that gun down, Archie?

35:11.806 --> 35:13.535
Please.

35:14.075 --> 35:15.872
So, you're the hit man.

35:16.544 --> 35:17.943
I'm not a hit man.

35:18.012 --> 35:20.480
I'm a private investigator.
I'm working for Charla Graham.

35:20.548 --> 35:22.311
That's what he said.

35:22.917 --> 35:25.385
I'm Thomas Magnum.
He said that, too.

35:26.821 --> 35:29.984
Now, look, you can either be a
dead murderer or a live witness,

35:30.058 --> 35:32.151
and as far as I'm concerned,
it's a real toss-up.

35:32.227 --> 35:35.355
He's just kidding.
It's just a joke.

35:37.165 --> 35:39.827
Okay, I'll go to the police.

35:39.901 --> 35:41.869
We'll take you there.
And I want protection.

35:41.936 --> 35:43.426
You'll get it.

35:44.505 --> 35:47.906
You know, I've never even
fired the damn thing.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.441
I almost wish you did.

36:04.158 --> 36:05.682
What did you do to the gate?

36:05.960 --> 36:07.120
R.J.: Uh-oh.

36:08.029 --> 36:11.089
What did you do
to the gate, R.J.?

36:11.165 --> 36:13.633
Well, Higgins changed the code,
so I had to, you know,

36:13.735 --> 36:15.999
manual-override the gate.

36:16.070 --> 36:19.767
Oh, great. You probably shorted
out the whole security system.

36:20.008 --> 36:22.704
Higgins is going to kill you.

36:24.946 --> 36:28.609
Got to admit though,
we make a great team.

36:29.050 --> 36:30.915
We don't make
any team at all, R.J.

36:30.985 --> 36:34.352
You're suppose to be going to school,
not playing Philip Marlowe.

36:34.922 --> 36:38.016
Well, I used a better
role model than that.

36:38.159 --> 36:40.491
Well, you did
a pretty lousy job of it.

36:40.595 --> 36:41.823
Sorry.

36:42.964 --> 36:44.932
But I had to do it.

36:45.366 --> 36:46.594
Why?

36:46.868 --> 36:51.202
Because all my life all I've ever
been is Robin Masters' punk nephew.

36:51.873 --> 36:54.171
The resident black sheep
of the family.

36:54.809 --> 36:57.403
He sends me here
to turn me legit

36:57.478 --> 37:00.276
by making me a cross
of Higgins and him.

37:01.749 --> 37:04.047
Well, it's not for me.

37:04.118 --> 37:07.144
R.J., you're never going
to know what's for you

37:07.221 --> 37:09.587
until you get some idea of
what the world's all about.

37:09.657 --> 37:12.785
And you never will, unless you get
some education and some discipline.

37:12.860 --> 37:14.555
Then you can
make your choices.

37:15.630 --> 37:20.329
At the moment,
Higgins is the best thing for you.

37:22.904 --> 37:25.134
So, we're gonna go inside

37:25.206 --> 37:28.004
and you're going to
apologize for the gate

37:28.076 --> 37:30.101
and everything else you've
done and maybe, just maybe,

37:30.178 --> 37:31.668
he won't send you packing.

37:32.013 --> 37:33.378
Okay?

37:33.748 --> 37:35.113
Okay.

37:38.519 --> 37:39.679
Thanks.

37:43.558 --> 37:44.786
What about my car?

37:44.859 --> 37:47.794
We'll get it later. Right now,
I don't want to let you out of my sight.

37:53.067 --> 37:54.398
Higgins?

37:56.871 --> 37:58.463
Something's wrong.

37:59.073 --> 38:00.597
Run, Magnum.

38:14.455 --> 38:16.889
Let's not overreact.

38:17.925 --> 38:19.893
One question.

38:20.361 --> 38:22.955
Where's Fleming?
None of your business.

38:23.030 --> 38:27.364
Oh, I think it is. Because I would
like to propose a little exchange.

38:27.869 --> 38:31.236
Your friend here for Fleming.

38:31.773 --> 38:35.334
Easy. You've got one hour.

38:35.410 --> 38:38.038
Or his condition
is going to get worse.

38:45.902 --> 38:49.303
I assure you,
your only rational and logical course

38:49.372 --> 38:52.102
is complete and
unconditional surrender.

38:52.175 --> 38:54.234
Now, if you will
give me your weapons.

38:54.311 --> 38:56.245
Hey, he's funny.

38:56.980 --> 38:58.572
You're funny.

38:58.648 --> 39:01.947
I certainly do not find
any humor in this situation.

39:02.018 --> 39:05.920
And if you persist...
Button it, will you?

39:09.559 --> 39:11.527
Nice lookin' dame.

39:11.928 --> 39:14.123
You know her personally?

39:14.197 --> 39:18.327
I mean, did you ever go out with her?
Like on a date?

39:19.269 --> 39:20.759
Put that down.

39:35.518 --> 39:37.577
Great movie.

39:37.654 --> 39:39.281
I saw it six times.

39:39.389 --> 39:43.519
Looks like you saw it, too.
I was there.

39:43.593 --> 39:44.685
Yeah?

39:45.128 --> 39:47.528
Remember what
they did at the end?

39:47.964 --> 39:50.330
Such madness.

39:52.936 --> 39:54.301
Boom.

39:56.473 --> 39:59.101
Hey, relax.

40:01.444 --> 40:03.344
R.J.: It's not going to work.

40:03.546 --> 40:05.844
It's got to.
It's not.

40:07.784 --> 40:09.843
You don't look
anything like him.

40:09.919 --> 40:12.513
I mean,
he's 6'4" and...

40:12.589 --> 40:14.420
Watch it. Watch it.

40:15.025 --> 40:16.617
It doesn't matter anyway.

40:16.693 --> 40:19.821
Fleming said that the only time they
saw him, he was sitting in the car,

40:19.896 --> 40:22.330
and since he's in
the police station right now,

40:22.399 --> 40:24.264
spilling his guts out
as we speak,

40:24.334 --> 40:25.961
and Thomas and T.C.
are doin' back up,

40:26.036 --> 40:29.631
that leaves only one
other guy. Yours truly.

40:30.373 --> 40:31.897
Or me.

40:32.275 --> 40:34.800
Listen, kid,
you got your orders.

40:35.679 --> 40:39.342
Just don't move and stay put.

40:39.582 --> 40:42.016
Maybe we should call the cops.
Oh, that's real cute.

40:42.085 --> 40:44.553
And have the swat team
lobbing in tear gas?

40:44.621 --> 40:47.181
Well, what happens
if they don't buy you?

40:47.891 --> 40:49.688
I'll just have to
take that chance.

40:51.661 --> 40:54.357
You could get killed.
You're damn right I could get killed!

40:54.431 --> 40:58.265
What do you think they're gonna do,
just let Higgins go and wave bye-bye?

40:58.468 --> 41:01.232
Let me just tell you something.
If I do buy it,

41:01.304 --> 41:03.204
I want you to know that
it's gonna be your fault.

41:03.273 --> 41:05.298
Does that make you
feel real good?

41:05.809 --> 41:08.403
Yeah, great. Look, kid,
this ain't a cartoon.

41:08.478 --> 41:10.810
It's gonna be like the shootout
at the O.K. Corral out there,

41:10.880 --> 41:13.280
and all you're doing
is making me nervous.

41:14.150 --> 41:16.846
Well, that's why
you should let me do this.

41:17.887 --> 41:21.152
Please. Come on, I mean,
everything's my fault.

41:21.291 --> 41:23.418
You guys don't deserve this.

41:23.626 --> 41:27.084
Oh, man, I really messed up.

41:27.997 --> 41:29.589
You gotta let me
make it up to you.

41:29.666 --> 41:31.930
I said no.
You gotta.

41:32.035 --> 41:33.696
No!
You gotta.

41:33.770 --> 41:36.364
I said...

41:37.707 --> 41:39.038
Oh, wow.

42:04.801 --> 42:07.292
Rick,
what's taking you so long?

42:08.304 --> 42:11.296
Two minutes.
And make sure you lock him up.

42:19.249 --> 42:20.341
Yeah.

42:20.517 --> 42:23.077
Two minutes and then
we deliver Fleming.

42:23.153 --> 42:25.053
We'll be there.

42:25.889 --> 42:27.117
Let's go.

42:27.190 --> 42:30.284
Start whistling, old chap,
maybe it'll bring you some luck.

43:13.136 --> 43:14.330
So long,

43:15.471 --> 43:16.460
Colonel.

43:29.686 --> 43:30.846
Higgins!

43:55.445 --> 43:57.538
That was very brave of you.

43:58.615 --> 44:00.742
And foolhardy.

44:16.399 --> 44:18.299
They're really dead.

44:22.605 --> 44:24.732
Sometimes that's part of it.

44:32.649 --> 44:35.846
R.J.: I'm leaving,
Higgins, sir.

44:36.486 --> 44:39.387
Why? I believe your
education is just beginning.

44:39.889 --> 44:41.823
Yeah, maybe it is.

44:43.326 --> 44:46.420
But I think it's about time
I did it on my own terms.

44:47.030 --> 44:48.759
I don't understand.

44:49.866 --> 44:53.859
I mean, I think
it's more important to me

44:54.170 --> 44:56.104
to see if I can
do it on my own

44:56.639 --> 45:00.973
without that prize at the end
being Uncle Robin's trust fund.

45:02.679 --> 45:04.579
Do you know what
I'm trying to say?

45:04.881 --> 45:06.314
I think so.

45:06.616 --> 45:09.710
Where do you expect to do this?
L.A.

45:10.453 --> 45:14.389
I'm just going to go there and
get a regular, mundane job.

45:14.457 --> 45:16.755
Take a few classes
at City College.

45:16.993 --> 45:19.223
Just be 20 years old
for a while.

45:19.295 --> 45:21.786
You think I'm doing
the right thing?

45:22.665 --> 45:25.156
Actually, your circumstances
somewhat remind me

45:25.234 --> 45:28.431
of a decision another lad
your age made once.

45:30.039 --> 45:32.007
Did he do the right thing?

45:34.610 --> 45:38.137
Yes. Yes, he did.

45:40.683 --> 45:43.311
Good luck, R.J.

45:43.553 --> 45:46.113
And if you find it too...

45:46.189 --> 45:49.886
I mean to say,
if you ever want to,

45:50.460 --> 45:52.985
you have a home here.

45:53.429 --> 45:55.989
Thanks. Sir.

46:06.075 --> 46:07.599
Higgins.

46:09.379 --> 46:10.676
Where is he?
Who?

46:10.747 --> 46:13.147
R.J.
He's off to Los Angeles.

46:13.216 --> 46:15.776
When?
He just left not 15 minutes ago.

46:15.852 --> 46:16.978
My God, Magnum,
you've broken it.

46:17.053 --> 46:20.284
That's not important now. It most certainly is.
What could be more important?

46:20.356 --> 46:22.847
How about the little runt
lying and selling the Ferrari?

46:22.925 --> 46:24.415
The Ferrari?
The green one.

46:24.494 --> 46:26.155
R.J. sold it?
Yes!

46:26.229 --> 46:27.856
How? Where? Why?

46:27.930 --> 46:29.522
I just went down
to the police station

46:29.599 --> 46:30.998
to straighten things out
with Charla

46:31.067 --> 46:32.432
and pick up the green...
Stop rambling.

46:32.502 --> 46:36.029
I'm not rambling! Lieutenant Tanaka
said that R.J. just stopped by,

46:36.139 --> 46:37.697
and he sold it
to a broker.

46:37.774 --> 46:39.935
A broker?
For cash.

46:44.147 --> 46:45.671
There's no fool like...

46:45.748 --> 46:47.215
What?

46:49.018 --> 46:50.383
Come along, Magnum.

46:50.453 --> 46:53.650
We may yet catch the little
bounder at the airport.
