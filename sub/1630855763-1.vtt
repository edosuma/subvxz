WEBVTT

00:03.280 --> 00:05.280
(light music playing)

00:10.320 --> 00:13.960
NARRATOR: Lang Lang is a unique artist
and certainly a unique classical artist,

00:14.040 --> 00:16.200
because this guy has superpowers.

00:17.680 --> 00:20.640
The highest echelon
of classical piano playing.

00:24.240 --> 00:29.120
Lang Lang at an early age, like, three,
was already playing the piano.

00:30.200 --> 00:32.680
And he had all the world's
greatest piano literature

00:32.759 --> 00:34.720
to fill his days and his soul.

00:38.080 --> 00:41.160
There's a stereotype
of a classical pianist,

00:41.240 --> 00:44.040
staid and composed and proper,

00:44.120 --> 00:46.160
but Lang Lang, he's more like a rock star.

00:46.920 --> 00:50.120
With Lang Lang,
there's always another chapter,

00:50.200 --> 00:52.520
and another level,
and another form of expression.

00:58.240 --> 01:00.360
He wanted to do these famous songs
from Disney.

01:01.120 --> 01:03.720
A lot of these songs
he knew them in his heart.

01:03.800 --> 01:04.920
They meant something to him.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.920
So when you combine that
with the world's greatest piano player,

01:12.000 --> 01:13.240
it's like fireworks.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.720
(melodic music playing)

01:33.480 --> 01:35.760
It's a big production.
(chuckles)

01:36.920 --> 01:40.040
NARRATOR:
Combining Lang Lang and Disney songs,

01:40.120 --> 01:42.320
and the Royal Albert Hall
is like the Holy Grail.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.840
The architecture of the building,
the history of the building.

01:44.920 --> 01:46.240
This is a special environment.

01:51.560 --> 01:52.360
Let's go.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.040
NARRATOR: The music rising from the stage
and the orchestra,

01:56.120 --> 01:58.640
everybody dressed to the nines
and playing their hearts out.

01:58.720 --> 02:01.640
For a moment, music carries you away
to this other place.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.960
(audience applauding)

02:14.920 --> 02:15.920
LANG LANG: Thank you.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.200
Thank you very much. Beautiful.

02:18.680 --> 02:19.640
How are you?

02:24.680 --> 02:25.480
Thank you.

02:29.480 --> 02:30.640
(applause stops)

02:35.640 --> 02:37.640
("Beauty and the Beast"
instrumental playing)

06:36.120 --> 06:38.120
(music fades)

06:44.880 --> 06:46.920
(audience applauding)

06:58.440 --> 07:00.840
(light music playing)

07:03.280 --> 07:05.440
Four, take one, Alpha, Bravo,
and Charlie, mark.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.320
MAN: Mark hit.

07:08.160 --> 07:13.200
As a kid, I actually had a very tough
practicing process.

07:13.280 --> 07:17.320
MOMENTO FROM 4 MONTHS OLD

07:20.400 --> 07:22.280
RON: Those early years for him
were very, very challenging,

07:22.360 --> 07:25.120
there's a lot of piano competitions,
there's a lot of pressure,

07:25.200 --> 07:26.920
a lot of pressure on a young boy.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.200
In this new generation,
everybody has a lot of, uh,

07:31.320 --> 07:32.600
you know, hobbies.

07:32.680 --> 07:35.400
LANG LANG: But when I was a kid,
I... I maybe more focused in music.

07:35.480 --> 07:39.720
He's always very passionate,
and he's always very authentic.

07:39.800 --> 07:44.240
His story, really kind of reflects also
a lot of Disney values.

07:44.320 --> 07:47.800
GINA: To believe in your dreams,
and also to always stay brave,

07:48.120 --> 07:51.080
to take challenges and risks,

07:51.160 --> 07:53.720
and mostly important,
um, to have a good heart.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.240
I did a lot of practicing,

07:55.320 --> 07:59.160
and, uh, I think I did six hours
when I was six years old,

07:59.240 --> 08:04.480
because I had to go through
all those major, minor keys of scales,

08:04.560 --> 08:07.840
arpeggios, chords, octave,

08:07.920 --> 08:14.760
and then I get into the music pieces
from Bach, Mozart, to Chinese folk music.

08:14.840 --> 08:19.720
So every day, I actually only have,
like, 30 minutes to watch, uh, television,

08:19.800 --> 08:22.400
and then I use that 30 minutes
to watch cartoons.

08:22.480 --> 08:25.640
LANG LANG: Mickey Mouse,
Donald Duck, Goofy, you know,

08:25.720 --> 08:27.400
all those great characters.

08:27.480 --> 08:31.720
This great animation,
you know, inspired me,

08:31.800 --> 08:37.520
helping me to understand life,
helping me to learn different cultures,

08:37.600 --> 08:41.559
it's also an escape
from my hard practicing,

08:41.640 --> 08:46.160
my magic carpet, you know,
for 30 minutes every day.

08:49.320 --> 08:53.600
Classical music's part of the success
of Disney films.

08:53.680 --> 08:56.280
The music style of Disney

08:56.360 --> 08:59.800
has to be passionate,
touching people's hearts,

08:59.880 --> 09:02.440
it has to be emotional.

09:03.200 --> 09:07.160
After Lang Lang became a father,
his heart became stronger,

09:07.240 --> 09:08.720
and softer at the same time.

09:08.800 --> 09:13.800
LANG LANG: Something really changes me
is when I'm having my first kid.

09:13.880 --> 09:17.800
Once I started playing Tarzan,
I found that, through him,

09:17.880 --> 09:20.120
a new Disney journey just start,

09:20.200 --> 09:23.640
and I felt more connected
to the character.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.560

(mouthing)
Thank you.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.400
(serene music playing)

18:17.400 --> 18:21.680
In our world, classical music world,
there always a danger,

18:21.760 --> 18:24.240
like, how far you can go.

18:24.320 --> 18:27.320
Sometimes in classical musical world,
we're so comfortable.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.800
You know why?
Because every repertoire we play

18:29.880 --> 18:32.480
is already existing for 200 years.

18:32.560 --> 18:37.920
If you look into the Hollywood,
if you look into, uh, popular culture,

18:38.360 --> 18:41.200
if they don't create something new,
they're out.

18:41.720 --> 18:45.880
They're absolutely out,
nobody will remember them in five years.

18:46.280 --> 18:48.360
Yeah, so... so that's a huge difference.

18:48.440 --> 18:54.000
We have to communicate
and we have to make some sound.

18:56.440 --> 18:59.960
He loves creating visions
and new journeys.

19:00.040 --> 19:02.640
One day he plays
Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto,

19:02.720 --> 19:05.840
the next day he plays Bach's
Goldberg Variations.

19:05.920 --> 19:09.360
GINA: And then next week,
he plays a beautiful Disney program.

19:09.440 --> 19:13.160
So I think it's very fascinating
that he can connect these worlds.

19:13.240 --> 19:16.680
He can make very complex
and intellectual music,

19:16.760 --> 19:19.560
like, approachable to everyone.

19:19.640 --> 19:23.200
And he can connect people's hearts
through music.

19:26.080 --> 19:30.840
Disney music had this magic power
to take the audience into a fantasy world.

19:32.600 --> 19:39.520
When you have all those melodies,
this is really not just from one culture.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.480
You have Mulan from China,

19:41.560 --> 19:44.720
you have Aladdin from the Middle East.

19:44.800 --> 19:49.360
You have Encanto from Colombia,
or Coco from Mexico.

19:49.600 --> 19:54.200
You have a lot of European fairy tales,
American-based stories.

19:54.280 --> 19:57.880
You just kind of get your eyes open.

19:58.520 --> 20:03.360
This is the way we should, you know,
kind of try to understand music.

20:03.440 --> 20:06.000
I'm trying to get out
from the comfort zone,

20:06.080 --> 20:10.240
to create something together
with spectacular Disney music,

20:10.320 --> 20:14.280
but in a classical music style,
to approach new audience,

20:14.360 --> 20:17.200
and to give them new story to tell.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.760
(audience applauding)

20:22.720 --> 20:24.840
("We Don't Talk About Bruno"

27:41.160 --> 27:44.160
(audience applauding)

28:02.520 --> 28:06.680
Can we just practice one more place
before...

28:06.760 --> 28:09.080
I... I mean, the hard place.

28:09.320 --> 28:10.760
For me, it's a bit too slow.

28:10.840 --> 28:13.160
(vocalizing)

28:13.240 --> 28:15.800
-(man humming a tune)
-Otherwise, I couldn't follow the... Yeah.

28:15.880 --> 28:20.920
(harmonizing)

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
So like the first two hours…

28:22.080 --> 28:24.360
HENRY: Lang Lang is just a person who...

28:24.760 --> 28:26.440
He's on a different wavelength.

28:26.520 --> 28:30.280
He's floating on a cloud,
he's picking things out of the universe,

28:30.360 --> 28:32.280
and flying on the magic carpet,

28:32.360 --> 28:34.880
and allowing himself
to, like, go into this world.

28:34.960 --> 28:36.560
Like-- He doesn't restrain himself.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.240
I think that's a little unusual
for classical music

28:39.320 --> 28:43.120
where the notes and the ink rule the day.

28:43.200 --> 28:44.640
-That was beautiful.
-MAN: That was beautiful.

28:44.720 --> 28:47.080
-LANG LANG: Okay, Reflection.
-MAN: Reflection.

28:47.160 --> 28:53.200
One of the challenge of this project
is actually quite hard one.

28:53.280 --> 29:00.120
How to make already existing
great melodies from Disney films itself

29:00.200 --> 29:02.720
into a pianistic work with orchestra?

29:02.800 --> 29:05.920
Do you want that a little--
Is that a little held in tempo?

29:06.000 --> 29:08.080
-LANG LANG: Uh, D, yeah? One second.
-Yeah. After the…

29:08.160 --> 29:10.720
(vocalizing)

29:11.280 --> 29:15.080
-Maybe from those octaves, yeah?
-Yeah, sure. Three bars before.

29:15.600 --> 29:18.240
We knew that we wanted to do
these famous songs from Disney.

29:18.960 --> 29:22.240
And the question,
with an artist like Lang Lang, is,

29:22.320 --> 29:25.840
his level of approaching the piano
is it's so highly evolved,

29:25.920 --> 29:28.880
the highest echelon
of classical piano playing.

29:28.960 --> 29:31.840
What do you give
to the world's greatest piano player

29:31.920 --> 29:34.280
to convey these songs and these melodies?

29:34.360 --> 29:38.560
LANG LANG: We were very lucky to work
with, uh, many of the greatest

29:38.640 --> 29:40.720
piano arranger in the world.

29:41.320 --> 29:43.000
You have to re-write a lot of things.

29:43.080 --> 29:46.040
We actually have the rhythm,
we have the harmony,

29:46.120 --> 29:48.000
we have the arpeggios,

29:48.080 --> 29:49.680
we have the octaves.

29:49.760 --> 29:53.200
You can feel this is a real chamber music.

29:53.280 --> 29:55.520
This is a... a piano concerto.

29:55.600 --> 29:59.280
And that gave me the great joy to do it.

29:59.360 --> 30:03.760
So, what you do is, probably,
you cut, like, here, remember?

30:03.840 --> 30:05.240
(soft melody playing)

30:09.120 --> 30:12.160
Wow, that was...
That is a powerful rehearsal.

30:12.240 --> 30:16.640
I see how much heart and spirit
and soul he puts into this project,

30:16.720 --> 30:21.880
and, um, to find great musicians
to collaborate with, to find composers,

30:21.960 --> 30:26.280
to find the best and unique
and virtuoso, um, arrangements,

30:26.360 --> 30:27.920
to make people happy,

30:28.000 --> 30:31.560
and to let everyone enjoy the beauty
of Disney music.

30:31.640 --> 30:35.440
His thing really is to convey emotion
through the piano.

30:35.520 --> 30:39.160
Now when you match that up
with this incredible technical facility

30:39.240 --> 30:41.200
where every option is open to him,

30:41.920 --> 30:44.000
it's like the ten fingers add up
to a hundred.

30:44.080 --> 30:48.040
The bar is set so high,
so thought through,

30:48.120 --> 30:50.160
and it all comes down to storytelling.

30:50.240 --> 30:53.960
LANG LANG:
Piano has to be absolutely there,

30:54.040 --> 30:56.040
fairy tale style playing.

30:56.120 --> 30:59.720
All those delicacy technique, light, fast.

30:59.800 --> 31:03.120
Technique has to serve music
hundred percent.

31:03.200 --> 31:05.000
And if that's too much, we have to cut.

31:05.080 --> 31:08.800
It's not-- This is not just making
some kind of a look,

31:08.880 --> 31:10.240
you know, kind of a gimmick that,

31:10.320 --> 31:13.400
"Hey, look,
my hand is all over the place."

31:13.480 --> 31:16.040
One may need the hands
to be all over the place,

31:16.120 --> 31:17.800
we have to be there, right?

31:17.880 --> 31:21.240
But if we don't need it,
if it's too much, we have to cut.

31:21.320 --> 31:22.960
We have to serve music.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.400
("A Whole New World" instrumental playing)

-STUDENT 2: Hi.

40:26.480 --> 40:27.480
LANG LANG: Hey.

40:29.960 --> 40:31.080
(Lang Lang chuckles)

40:31.160 --> 40:34.240
-How long have you all learned piano?
-STUDENT 3: Three years.

40:34.320 --> 40:35.320
Three years already?

40:35.920 --> 40:37.360
LANG LANG: This guy's a musician.

40:37.440 --> 40:39.560
Maybe I...
I should hear you play a little bit.

40:39.640 --> 40:42.480
So let's have some fun
with your music first,

40:42.560 --> 40:44.600
and then we go from there, okay?

40:44.680 --> 40:46.200
We know through all the years

40:46.280 --> 40:50.040
what kind of effect music has
on children's lives.

40:52.920 --> 40:54.400
GINA: Some of the children

40:54.480 --> 40:58.800
don't necessarily
have the opportunity to get close

40:58.880 --> 41:03.280
and to get in contact with music
and to learn an instrument.

41:03.360 --> 41:05.880
So what Lang Lang does since 2008 already,

41:05.960 --> 41:08.280
he started his foundation in 2008,

41:08.360 --> 41:10.240
is to go into public schools

41:10.320 --> 41:14.240
where music is actually not
in the curriculum anymore.

41:14.320 --> 41:18.240
Normally, I like to... to visit, uh,
the schools everywhere I go.

41:18.960 --> 41:24.000
We have around 100 schools
around the world, in China, in the U.S.,

41:24.080 --> 41:25.840
and now we're coming to Europe.

41:25.920 --> 41:29.560
And it's quite important
that we support the kid to learn music,

41:29.640 --> 41:35.640
particularly at the more
disadvantaged area in the city.

41:35.720 --> 41:38.200
So I play the bass line
and then you can...

41:38.280 --> 41:43.920
(vocalizing)

41:44.520 --> 41:45.840
Good, good, good.

41:45.920 --> 41:49.200
I'm getting tired of looking
into the schools,

41:49.280 --> 41:52.640
you know, going there only once
in our lifetime,

41:52.720 --> 41:57.280
and then we're happy about it,
but actually, you didn't really help much.

41:57.360 --> 41:59.920
LANG LANG: After a musician's gone,
they are back to normal.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.720
No music class. We need to take action.

42:02.800 --> 42:07.680
Really get deep into the school system.

42:07.760 --> 42:12.720
Our aim is to improve our education tools.

42:12.800 --> 42:17.360
We always have the smart digital pianos
in one class,

42:17.440 --> 42:20.160
20 to 30, uh, digital pianos.

42:20.240 --> 42:26.680
Each kid not only listening to the class,
but they have the possibility to play.

42:26.760 --> 42:29.080
That's the aim.
Yeah, you have to touch the keys.

42:31.680 --> 42:34.320
(students murmuring)

42:35.920 --> 42:38.120
Every time when I'm visiting a school,

42:38.200 --> 42:41.280
the kids always ask me,
"Hey, can you play some Disney music?"

42:41.360 --> 42:46.240
After The Disney Book,
I'm much more equipped,

42:46.320 --> 42:50.680
I think now it's so much more fun
with the, you know, the repertoire I know,

42:50.760 --> 42:52.080
and to share with the kid.

42:52.160 --> 42:53.960
And also ask them to learn.

42:54.040 --> 42:55.040
GINA: So many children,

42:55.120 --> 42:58.920
they love so much more of going to school
because of those music classes.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.520
And it builds their confidence,

43:01.600 --> 43:04.480
and they can achieve their dreams
through music

43:04.560 --> 43:06.760
because they see that they're strong.

43:06.840 --> 43:09.360
It's all inside of them already.

43:09.440 --> 43:13.080
It just needs this spark,
this chance to come out.

43:13.160 --> 43:18.440
Music is the most fair,
should be the most fair art form.

43:18.520 --> 43:23.640
No matter what background you are,
on stage, we're all equal.

43:23.720 --> 43:27.400
LANG LANG: On stage, if you're great,
the world will choose you.

43:28.760 --> 43:30.520

43:37.320 --> 43:39.680

46:06.600 --> 46:07.600
Thank you.

46:07.680 --> 46:09.680

46:21.400 --> 46:23.000

46:24.480 --> 46:25.680
Rachmaninoff.

46:28.240 --> 46:29.280
Prelude.

46:51.160 --> 46:52.960
What an imagination.

46:58.640 --> 46:59.800
That's incredible.

46:59.880 --> 47:04.840
I got so impressed because,
honestly, I didn't know this film.

47:05.800 --> 47:07.800
This is really a musician's life.

47:09.560 --> 47:11.360
Look, boxing with the piano.

47:12.800 --> 47:15.000
When the kid hate practicing,

47:15.080 --> 47:17.320
you know, like boxing his piano.
(grunting)

47:17.400 --> 47:18.680
It's exactly like that.

47:21.400 --> 47:25.560
You'll see all different
piano schools technique,

47:26.320 --> 47:28.640
is in that, uh, little film.

47:28.720 --> 47:32.960
I mean, the detail is incredible,
you know, this love and hate to piano.

47:33.040 --> 47:35.040
(crowd applauding onscreen)

47:36.880 --> 47:39.200
This is always in our imaginations.

47:39.920 --> 47:43.560
I felt that Mickey Mouse already knows
about this hundred years ago.

47:43.640 --> 47:45.200
I mean, this is really impressive.

47:45.280 --> 47:49.200
It's incredible that, uh, you see this
in the very beginning.

47:49.280 --> 47:51.520
Classical music already,

47:51.600 --> 47:56.400
so much more multi-dimensional.

47:56.480 --> 47:58.480
(serene music playing)

48:00.840 --> 48:06.200
This is really proof that 100 years ago,

48:06.280 --> 48:11.960
Disney already focused classical music
into their great creation.

48:12.040 --> 48:17.680
And, uh, to see this direct inspiration
from classical music

48:17.760 --> 48:19.680
combined with Disney,

48:20.240 --> 48:22.360
uh, it... it's tremendous.

48:22.440 --> 48:29.240
Fascinating to see that connection
in the such early stage in Disney's films.
