ABBY LEE:
<i>Previously on</i> Dance Moms...

00:02.369 --> 00:04.071
We don't have
Maddie, but I have

00:04.071 --> 00:05.072
the next best thing.

00:05.072 --> 00:07.741
GIRLS:
Hi!

00:07.741 --> 00:09.843
HOLLY: <i>I have to bring</i>
<i>Nia and Kalani to take a class</i>

00:09.843 --> 00:11.812
<i>at the Debbie Allen</i>
<i>Dance Academy.</i>

00:11.812 --> 00:13.046
Come back, 'cause
we do everything.

00:13.046 --> 00:14.915
I am speechless right now.

00:14.915 --> 00:16.316
Is this the mini team now?

00:16.316 --> 00:17.518
ABBY LEE:
<i>I would like seven.</i>

00:17.518 --> 00:18.819
<i>When you have</i>
<i>five kids on stage,</i>

00:18.819 --> 00:20.187
you can see every mistake.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.222
JILL:
<i>Abby resigned from the team.</i>

00:22.222 --> 00:23.857
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Our highest scoring</i>

00:23.857 --> 00:25.859
group dance,
"Bollywood Dreams."

00:25.859 --> 00:27.961
(crowd cheering)
JILL: <i>Our team, which has grown</i>

00:27.961 --> 00:30.097
with these minis,
came out on top.

00:31.398 --> 00:33.000
ABBY LEE:
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

00:33.000 --> 00:34.768
Hello, ladies.

00:34.768 --> 00:35.969
You were gone last week.

00:35.969 --> 00:37.004
Are you back

00:37.004 --> 00:38.338
for good this week?

00:40.307 --> 00:41.575
(women gasping)

00:41.575 --> 00:43.544
We have a mini!

00:43.544 --> 00:46.046
LYNN: <i>I'm not gonna compromise</i>
<i>who I am as a person</i>

00:46.046 --> 00:47.514
to, like, do things

00:47.514 --> 00:49.383
that I wouldn't normally do,
just to have

00:49.383 --> 00:51.318
my daughter stay.
Yeah, we'll see.

00:51.318 --> 00:53.420
HOLLY: <i>Advocate for</i>
<i>your child, that's it.</i>

00:53.420 --> 00:55.122
If you don't feel
comfortable doing that,

00:55.122 --> 00:57.357
<i>then this is not</i>
<i>the right environment for you.</i>

00:57.357 --> 00:59.059
ABBY LEE:
Brynn is taking the lead.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.828
If the group doesn't win,
it's your fault.

01:01.828 --> 01:03.730
JESSALYNN: <i>So has Abby asked you</i>
<i>to stay next week</i>

01:03.730 --> 01:05.065
since Maddie's gonna be here?

01:05.065 --> 01:06.233
ASHLEE:
<i>Are the minis coming back</i>

01:06.233 --> 01:07.334
and is Brynn coming back?

01:07.334 --> 01:09.403
I'd be more concerned if
I'm coming back.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.505
ASHLEE:
<i>What I would ask is that</i>

01:11.505 --> 01:14.274
I and Brynn get the same respect
that you guys ask from me.

01:14.274 --> 01:15.108
(bleep) you.

01:16.343 --> 01:19.346
♪ Livin' on the dance floor. ♪

01:19.346 --> 01:21.715

JILL:
<i>Here we go again.</i>

01:27.120 --> 01:28.388
She quit, but yet...

01:28.388 --> 01:29.690
HOLLY and JESSALYNN:
We're back.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.859
Last week,
Abby locked the studio doors.

01:32.859 --> 01:35.329
<i>We couldn't get in.</i>

01:35.329 --> 01:37.731
But we saw on social media that
she's been teaching classes.

01:37.731 --> 01:40.934
<i>We all know that she has been</i>
<i>dealing with her legal issues,</i>

01:40.934 --> 01:44.004
<i>but hopefully</i>
<i>things have calmed down</i>

01:44.004 --> 01:45.572
<i>and she'll be here this week.</i>

01:45.572 --> 01:46.673
Hello, ladies.

01:46.673 --> 01:47.808
You all look
beautiful.

01:47.808 --> 01:50.110
HOLLY:
You were gone last week.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.346
Are you back
for good this week?

01:52.346 --> 01:53.680
'Cause you resigned.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.749
That was the last
information that we had.

01:55.749 --> 01:58.118
We received an e‐mail that...

01:58.118 --> 02:00.454
she's resigning.
What?

02:00.454 --> 02:02.589
Do you still want to do
the competition team or not?

02:02.589 --> 02:04.591
Uh...

02:06.593 --> 02:07.894
No.

02:07.894 --> 02:09.396
But you're here.

02:09.396 --> 02:12.332
The money's worth it
to the attorneys, not to me.

02:12.332 --> 02:13.600
I could care less.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.737
Do you want us just to leave?
What do you want us to do?

02:16.737 --> 02:17.771
HOLLY:
We could call Debbie Allen,

02:17.771 --> 02:18.772
because she has
a space available.

02:18.772 --> 02:19.806
Do you want us
to do that?

02:19.806 --> 02:21.241
What do you
want us to do?

02:21.241 --> 02:22.275
We're here.

02:22.275 --> 02:24.244
You weren't there
last week, so...

02:24.244 --> 02:25.679
I was on vacation.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.347
HOLLY: No, you resigned.
JESSALYNN:
You said you resigned.

02:27.347 --> 02:28.482
You resigned;
that's not vacation.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.983
JESSALYNN: That was
the last we heard from you.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.451
ABBY LEE:
Okay, so if I'm here

02:31.451 --> 02:33.286
four days out of
five or if I'm here

02:33.286 --> 02:35.622
two days out of five,
what difference does it make?

02:35.622 --> 02:37.658
I‐I get my work finished.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.660
When you have a general
on the combat field,

02:39.660 --> 02:41.428
the general doesn't go AWOL.

02:41.428 --> 02:43.096
Oh, I think that generals
have resigned in the past.

02:43.096 --> 02:45.365
You're the
schoolteacher.

02:45.365 --> 02:46.700
I don't know what to do.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.201
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

02:48.201 --> 02:49.536
Abby's checked out.
I don't know.

02:49.536 --> 02:50.937
Why is your daughter
not in here warming up,

02:50.937 --> 02:52.406
is what I want to know.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.875
I'm gonna go get the kids.
I'm gonna go get the kids.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.877
Let's get the kids.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.211
It's incredibly
disappointing to be

02:58.211 --> 03:01.081
on an elite competition team
for several years

03:01.081 --> 03:02.883
<i>and have Abby</i>
<i>not invested in the girls.</i>

03:02.883 --> 03:04.484
<i>But, you know what,</i>
<i>we're committed and loyal</i>

03:04.484 --> 03:07.421
<i>to the team, even if she's not.</i>

03:07.421 --> 03:09.189
ABBY LEE:
Welcome, everybody!

03:10.357 --> 03:11.958
How are you little ones doing?

03:11.958 --> 03:13.260
GIRLS:
Good.

03:13.260 --> 03:15.362
Are the minis on
the pyramid today?

03:15.362 --> 03:17.297
The minis are on the pyramid.

03:17.297 --> 03:18.598
TIFFANIE: <i>The reason</i>
<i>we're back this week</i>

03:18.598 --> 03:20.100
<i>is we made a commitment</i>

03:20.100 --> 03:21.768
to Abby, when she invited us
here the first time,

03:21.768 --> 03:24.705
that we would be here
and be on this team.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.239
ABBY LEE:
Maddie is not here.

03:26.239 --> 03:28.008
She's in New York City.

03:28.008 --> 03:30.043
I wasn't there
last week.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.645
I don't really care
what happens.

03:31.645 --> 03:32.779
<i>I know I had three duets in.</i>

03:32.779 --> 03:34.715
Did you see
any of the duets?

03:34.715 --> 03:36.650
Actually, I did.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.886
I saw the people that beat you.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.655
They're nobodies.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.523
Nobodies.

03:43.523 --> 03:46.059
Again, you had
a group routine.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.294
<i>I thought it was sloppy.</i>

03:47.294 --> 03:48.962
<i>I thought it was a hot mess.</i>

03:48.962 --> 03:50.897
JESSALYNN:
<i>Abby has no right to comment.</i>

03:50.897 --> 03:52.566
She wasn't even
at the competition.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.602
The Bollywood number
was beautiful, and it won.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.070
JILL: Well, Abby,
Ashlee had a problem

03:57.070 --> 03:59.306
with, um,
Kendall and Brynn's duet.

03:59.306 --> 04:01.041
It‐it...

04:01.041 --> 04:04.044
was the highest duet
here in this room,

04:04.044 --> 04:05.512
but it came in third,

04:05.512 --> 04:06.680
and she's used to
always winning.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.914
So maybe this isn't
the place for her.

04:07.914 --> 04:08.915
I don't like to lose.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.250
No one likes to lose!

04:10.250 --> 04:11.718
ASHLEE:
I don't see what's wrong

04:11.718 --> 04:13.887
with going to a competition
and wanting to win.

04:13.887 --> 04:15.255
No one said that.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.957
Well, if you don't want to win,
you shouldn't go.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.291
Exactly my point.

04:19.326 --> 04:20.694
Okay, let's move on.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.429
So, girls,

04:22.429 --> 04:23.330
pyramid.

04:23.330 --> 04:24.698
First...

04:24.698 --> 04:26.633
at the bottom of the pyramid

04:26.633 --> 04:27.601
is Peyton.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.969
You need to wash out

04:28.969 --> 04:30.937
your mother's mouth with soap.

04:30.937 --> 04:34.107
Peyton was in the corner going,
"Mommy, stop. Mommy, just stop!"

04:34.107 --> 04:35.408
KERRI:
No, she didn't.

04:35.408 --> 04:37.377
Peyton was on my lap,
dumb (bleep).

04:37.377 --> 04:40.046
ABBY LEE:
Next we have...

04:40.046 --> 04:41.148
Ari.

04:41.148 --> 04:44.417
For the level
of your dancing,

04:44.417 --> 04:47.220
<i>you should be able to pick up</i>
<i>the choreography</i>

04:47.220 --> 04:49.790
at that same level of expertise.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.758
And you don't.

04:51.758 --> 04:54.227
Next, we have... Alexus.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.896
You pick up well,

04:55.896 --> 04:57.531
but nature isn't on your side.

04:57.531 --> 05:01.234
<i>It's the flexibility,</i>
<i>the strength,</i>

05:01.234 --> 05:03.170
the turn‐out.

05:03.170 --> 05:04.604
All of those things
you're lacking.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.874
And... Alysa.

05:07.874 --> 05:09.042
You pick up quick,

05:09.042 --> 05:10.377
<i>you're smart,</i>

05:10.377 --> 05:11.845
<i>you're not built</i>
<i>like your mom.</i>

05:11.845 --> 05:12.879
<i>Right now</i>

05:12.879 --> 05:14.581
that's not a problem.

05:14.581 --> 05:15.715
Someday it will be.

05:16.650 --> 05:17.751
Moving up.

05:18.785 --> 05:19.886
JoJo.

05:19.886 --> 05:23.089
I think that
you welcome

05:23.089 --> 05:24.991
every genre of dance,

05:24.991 --> 05:27.294
and I think that you enjoy
learning new things.

05:27.294 --> 05:30.063
It's not a bad thing where
you are; it's just what it is.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.932
Yeah, I'm not
on the bottom now.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.134
And next we have Brynn.

05:36.169 --> 05:39.072
Your legs are great,
your leaps are great,

05:39.072 --> 05:41.007
your acrobatic tricks are great,

05:41.007 --> 05:44.177
but you don't attack
the dynamics of the music

05:44.177 --> 05:46.279
or the style of dance
that you're doing.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.481
That's where you fall short.

05:48.481 --> 05:49.816
Next...

05:51.885 --> 05:53.386
...Kendall.

05:54.387 --> 05:55.388
Your duet.

05:55.388 --> 05:56.690
Third.

05:58.325 --> 05:59.326
Next we have Nia.

05:59.326 --> 06:02.229
I'm gonna pull
this off, too,

06:02.229 --> 06:06.333
because, Kalani, you were also
in a duet with Nia.

06:07.534 --> 06:10.503
<i>I think you both</i>
<i>could have been stronger.</i>

06:10.503 --> 06:11.771
Now, Kalani...

06:13.073 --> 06:15.642
...you were
a little more African than Nia.

06:15.642 --> 06:16.877
HOLLY:
Abby,

06:16.877 --> 06:18.278
I would not go there.

06:18.278 --> 06:21.147
I will say, both
girls were great.

06:21.147 --> 06:23.650
Uh, maybe I was shocked
to see you do this style.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.318
HOLLY:
I think, uh, I think

06:25.318 --> 06:27.621
that might be your issue.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.256
Where it makes sense
for you to do this.

06:29.256 --> 06:32.359
Why? 'Cause she's had
three weeks of it this summer?

06:32.359 --> 06:34.561
No, because
she's African‐American.

06:34.561 --> 06:35.795
She looks the part.

06:35.795 --> 06:38.465
Abby! What does that
have to do with anything?

06:38.465 --> 06:40.133
African‐American
does not mean we come from

06:40.133 --> 06:42.502
the continent
of Africa.
I know.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.537
HOLLY: We're Americans.
This is ridiculous.

06:44.537 --> 06:45.906
I think you've
lost your mind.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.708
Anyone here
who was watching

06:48.708 --> 06:49.976
that dance‐‐

06:49.976 --> 06:52.145
which you were not,
'cause you didn't show up

06:52.145 --> 06:53.246
to do your job...

06:53.246 --> 06:54.447
Nia, I'm not trying

06:54.447 --> 06:56.549
to be offensive;
what I'm trying to say

06:56.549 --> 06:59.586
is that I want you to work
harder, I want you to be

06:59.586 --> 07:02.355
the best that you can
possibly be, and I don't think

07:02.355 --> 07:04.357
you've even touched
on that yet.

07:04.357 --> 07:06.893
HOLLY: <i>That is, like,</i>
so <i>inappropriate.</i>

07:06.893 --> 07:10.630
<i>As history has proven,</i>
<i>Abby's really impulsive.</i>

07:10.630 --> 07:12.799
And she never takes ownership
of what she says anyway.

07:12.799 --> 07:14.968
Kalani, you weren't perfect.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.704
Did it surprise me
what you did? Yes.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.639
Do I think that
you could be better?

07:19.639 --> 07:20.640
Yes.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.442
And on top of
the pyramid...

07:22.442 --> 07:24.244
is Mackenzie.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.246
(girls cheering)

07:28.715 --> 07:31.084
Mackenzie embraced

07:31.084 --> 07:32.819
the routine.

07:32.819 --> 07:34.287
<i>She had fun with it.</i>

07:34.287 --> 07:35.588
<i>She is a performer.</i>

07:37.090 --> 07:39.426
This week,

07:39.426 --> 07:41.061
we're going to Devotion 2 Dance

07:41.061 --> 07:42.696
in Agoura Hills.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.931
We have two
group routines.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.600
You little minis over there,

07:47.600 --> 07:50.136
your group will
be performing

07:50.136 --> 07:51.404
a jazz routine

I feel like, until Brynn

15:49.248 --> 15:51.150
is under
the same group protection

15:51.150 --> 15:54.086
of "we don't talk about
the kids," which she's not,

15:54.086 --> 15:56.889
what I would
ask is that

15:56.889 --> 16:00.359
I and Brynn get the same respect
that you guys ask from me.

16:00.359 --> 16:01.828
HOLLY:
<i>You know, for years,</i>

16:01.828 --> 16:03.696

<i>a pact together.</i>

16:03.696 --> 16:05.731
<i>We don't talk about the girls.</i>

16:05.731 --> 16:07.633
It seems as though
there's a disconnect.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.535
As an outsider
coming in,

16:09.535 --> 16:13.806
you can't just disrupt
the whole...

16:13.806 --> 16:15.508
experience of how we operate.

16:15.508 --> 16:16.876
It's a delicate balance.

16:16.876 --> 16:19.011
ASHLEE:
<i>Walking into this situation</i>

16:19.011 --> 16:20.913
with Brynn being called
Maddie's replacement

16:20.913 --> 16:24.050
was a setup for me
to not really have friends here.

16:24.050 --> 16:26.185
<i>They don't want somebody here</i>
<i>to replace Maddie.</i>

16:26.185 --> 16:27.854
<i>That puts a lot of pressure</i>
<i>on Brynn.</i>

16:27.854 --> 16:29.121
<i>She's got to prove herself.</i>

16:29.121 --> 16:32.258
I feel like I can't say anything

16:32.258 --> 16:35.728
without being completely
annihilated at this point.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.363
And it's like, if you guys
want me to chill out,

16:37.363 --> 16:38.698
then you guys got to
chill out with me.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.267
Just‐just try coming in
not like a tornado.

16:41.267 --> 16:44.470
Uh, believe me, I'm...
s‐sitting quiet today.

16:44.470 --> 16:47.139
HOLLY: <i>I hope Ashlee understood</i>
<i>what we were trying to say.</i>

16:47.139 --> 16:52.178
I think Ashlee might be able
to make... some improvements.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.679
<i>But Ashlee is Ashlee,</i>

16:53.679 --> 16:55.381

<i>hardheaded and stubborn.</i>

16:55.381 --> 16:56.782

<i>Can I just</i>

16:56.782 --> 16:58.184

16:58.184 --> 16:59.585
No, not‐not at all.

16:59.585 --> 17:01.287
LYNN: <i>Even though Abby</i>
<i>kicked us out yesterday,</i>

really intimidating,

to have Kendyl on the team.

17:08.394 --> 17:10.496

for the group routine?

17:10.496 --> 17:12.899
Poof. Be gone.

17:12.899 --> 17:14.233

her end of the bargain.

<i>we need this fifth girl?</i>

17:23.042 --> 17:24.076
How do you feel?

17:24.076 --> 17:25.578
Like she's not
accepting you or what?

17:25.578 --> 17:27.013
You just got
to keep pushing, right?

17:27.013 --> 17:28.814
No, I feel like...

17:28.814 --> 17:30.816
I feel like that was,
like, my warning.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.787
"Fever Rising," right?

17:34.787 --> 17:36.656
"Fever Rising"‐‐ that's
the name of the dance.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.891
So, but it's almost like
you're the fever, you're hot

17:38.891 --> 17:40.860
and you're rising.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.228
<i>Alysa was one of my faves.</i>

17:42.228 --> 17:44.196
<i>I think she's fun,</i>
<i>I think she's smart.</i>

17:44.196 --> 17:46.332
Now, this solo is hot,

17:46.332 --> 17:49.001
<i>it's sassy, it's funky.</i>

17:49.001 --> 17:50.670

Do you guys think
that if you win this week,

17:54.941 --> 17:56.142
Abby will ask you
to stay or, like...?

17:56.142 --> 17:58.277
That's what we want.

17:58.277 --> 18:00.479
JESSALYNN: There's a lot
of pressure this week.

18:00.479 --> 18:03.049
You are trying to make a team.

18:03.049 --> 18:04.350
Yes.

18:04.350 --> 18:06.319
I think this week is huge
in my opinion.

18:06.319 --> 18:09.355
One, two, three,
four, leap.

18:09.355 --> 18:12.458
One, two, three, four,
leap, finish.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.226
<i>Just pretty like a big push.</i>

18:14.226 --> 18:16.529

Right.

18:18.364 --> 18:20.199
Boys are stupid.

18:20.199 --> 18:22.401
Excuse me, Abby, I'm just
gonna ask you one last time.

18:22.401 --> 18:24.770
Oh, and I wish you wouldn't.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.573
Get out of this room and quit
being so rude to me. Go!

18:27.573 --> 18:29.875
I just need to know if we're
staying or if we're going.

18:29.875 --> 18:32.378
You need to know
when I tell you. Go!

18:32.378 --> 18:34.547
Do you want your kid
in the routine or not?!

18:34.547 --> 18:35.581
I do.

18:35.581 --> 18:37.183
Then get out of here right now!

18:39.285 --> 18:41.153
Dumb, da‐dumb, dumb.

18:41.153 --> 18:43.055

32:28.947 --> 32:32.184
And you dance
together as a team.

32:32.184 --> 32:35.687
Although we have a new member...
or not.

32:35.687 --> 32:38.223
Will Brynn stay

32:38.223 --> 32:39.491
when Maddie returns?

32:39.491 --> 32:42.494
Maybe, maybe not.

32:42.494 --> 32:44.796
You little ones,

32:44.796 --> 32:46.097
it's a fun dance.

32:46.097 --> 32:47.299
I want to have fun

32:47.299 --> 32:48.600
sitting in the audience.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.368
I want the judges
to be entertained.

32:50.368 --> 32:53.839
Yes? All right.

32:53.839 --> 32:57.676
And I want people to say,
"Oh, my gosh, they're beautiful.

32:57.676 --> 33:00.078
Those are Abby's girls."

33:00.078 --> 33:02.013
All right, it's time to go.
Let's do it.

33:03.748 --> 33:05.517
<i>I have a lot of decisions</i>
<i>to make</i>

33:05.517 --> 33:07.018
<i>at the end</i>
<i>of this competition.</i>

33:07.018 --> 33:10.722
But then again, I think
that the girls dancing on stage

33:10.722 --> 33:13.391
<i>will make that decision for me.</i>

33:13.391 --> 33:15.927
<i>Do I keep the minis around?</i>
<i>Yes or no?</i>

33:15.927 --> 33:18.730
Does Brynn become
a permanent member of the team

33:18.730 --> 33:21.600
after Maddie returns?

33:21.600 --> 33:23.101
Let's see how they do.

33:25.537 --> 33:28.707
ANNOUNCER: Coming up next,
"Cavemen Undercover."

33:28.707 --> 33:30.442

33:30.442 --> 33:33.144
This is the first time Abby's
gonna see these girls dance.

33:33.144 --> 33:35.213
<i>But I'm not sure</i>
<i>if it's winning material.</i>

33:35.213 --> 33:36.848
<i>All they're seeing</i>

33:36.848 --> 33:38.617
is our girls on stage
acting like cavemen.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.185
<i>I'm really nervous.</i>

33:40.185 --> 33:43.221
<i>I don't know</i>

<i>I think Brynn is</i>

37:56.741 --> 37:59.043
a fine dancer;
I think she knows her technique.

37:59.043 --> 38:01.746
<i>But I miss Maddie.</i>

38:01.746 --> 38:04.516
Maddie is a huge addition
to our team,

38:04.516 --> 38:06.851
and when she's not there,
there's a huge hole,

38:06.851 --> 38:08.820
no matter who steps in
to fill it.

38:08.820 --> 38:11.256
<i>I don't know.</i>

38:45.623 --> 38:47.091
Nope, not at all.

39:03.708 --> 39:06.477
<i>and she brings in</i>
<i>a new mom and daughter?</i>

<i>This was a big week for Brynn.</i>

39:33.538 --> 39:35.773
She was stepping in
to fill Maddie's shoes.

39:35.773 --> 39:38.543
<i>She has to prove</i>
<i>that she's a winner</i>

39:38.543 --> 39:41.112
<i>and that she should</i>
<i>stick around again next week</i>

And in first place, we have...

39:49.954 --> 39:51.956

First place. Congrats.

39:53.358 --> 39:55.293
(crowd cheering)

39:58.663 --> 40:01.032
Our group dance was amazing.
The girls were beautiful.

40:01.032 --> 40:03.201
<i>Can they do more? Absolutely.</i>

40:03.201 --> 40:05.470
Did we come out on top? We did.

40:05.470 --> 40:07.171
What did you guys think
of their...

40:07.171 --> 40:08.740
of your little group number?

40:08.740 --> 40:10.141
I mean, we think
they did good, you know...

40:10.141 --> 40:12.110
You guys have to
stop being so, like,

40:12.110 --> 40:13.978
"We did good,
we did good."

40:13.978 --> 40:15.813
Like, you're trying
to make a team here.

40:15.813 --> 40:17.916
It wasn't good. Your
group dance wasn't good!

40:17.916 --> 40:20.585
Well, whose girls taught us
the choreography though?

40:20.585 --> 40:21.753
JESSALYNN:
We didn't teach you

40:21.753 --> 40:23.688
to fall on the girl
in front of you.

40:23.688 --> 40:25.657
That was a wreck.
That was a wreck.

40:25.657 --> 40:28.026
JILL: Abby, what did you
think of the group dances?

40:28.026 --> 40:29.661
Specifically, what'd you
think of the little ones?

40:30.929 --> 40:32.463
ABBY LEE:
I think that, uh...

40:34.032 --> 40:35.934
...it was age‐appropriate,

40:35.934 --> 40:40.038
it was fun, it was entertaining,
people laughed.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.641
You know.

40:43.641 --> 40:46.311
ABBY LEE: <i>Frankly,</i>
<i>the routine was sloppy.</i>

40:46.311 --> 40:47.912
<i>That's not good</i>
<i>for the Abby Lee Dance Company.</i>

40:47.912 --> 40:50.448
<i>So they're gonna continue</i>
<i>their training,</i>

40:50.448 --> 40:53.651
<i>they're gonna get some rest,</i>
<i>they're gonna focus.</i>

40:53.651 --> 40:56.654
Should they come back
tomorrow? No.

40:56.654 --> 40:58.656
Should they come back ever?

41:00.158 --> 41:02.093
ASHLEE: Are the minis coming
back, and is Brynn coming back?

41:02.093 --> 41:04.195
I'd be more concerned
if I'm coming back.

41:04.195 --> 41:06.164
JILL: Well, are you
coming back next week?

41:10.401 --> 41:12.837
ABBY LEE: <i>I can't promise</i>
<i>where I'll be next week.</i>

41:12.837 --> 41:16.007
Who knows what opportunities
lie ahead for me?

41:16.007 --> 41:19.344
But I do know that Brynn did
an outstanding job,

41:19.344 --> 41:21.379
and I'm gonna keep her around.

41:21.379 --> 41:23.181
I'll see you on the flip side.

41:23.181 --> 41:25.316
HOLLY:
<i>We need a leader,</i>

41:25.316 --> 41:27.952
<i>and Abby doesn't want</i>
<i>to do her job as a leader.</i>

41:27.952 --> 41:30.888
<i>I'm sure there are other people</i>
<i>who would gladly</i>

41:30.888 --> 41:32.690
<i>lead this team.</i>

41:32.690 --> 41:36.761
The ALDC competition team
made Abby a household name.

41:36.761 --> 41:39.330
<i>And if those girls</i>
<i>are not here anymore</i>

41:39.330 --> 41:41.232
<i>and they're off</i>
<i>doing other things,</i>

41:41.232 --> 41:43.067
who's gonna be there

41:43.067 --> 41:46.270
to help continue making Abby
a household name?

41:52.844 --> 41:54.012
When you step out
on that stage,

41:54.012 --> 41:56.748
I want you to be
what people expect you to be.

41:58.416 --> 42:00.051
<i>Especially when I'm not here.</i>

42:00.051 --> 42:01.452
This show has to go on.

42:01.452 --> 42:02.353
Why?

42:02.353 --> 42:03.488
I have things to do.

42:03.488 --> 42:05.056
JILL:
<i>She doesn't want us here.</i>

42:05.056 --> 42:06.657
Did she say that?
I'm not working anymore.

42:07.492 --> 42:08.860
She did.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.328

42:10.328 --> 42:11.729
ABBY LEE:
<i>And I have battles to fight.</i>

42:11.729 --> 42:12.764
You are making
this whole thing my fault.

42:12.764 --> 42:14.932
It's your fault!

42:14.932 --> 42:16.367
ABBY LEE: You need to be
that well‐oiled machine

Dance Company created.
