17:49.601 --> 17:51.970
That's $40,000.

17:52.037 --> 17:53.205
That's a lot of money.

17:53.272 --> 17:55.407
- A thousand people?
No, no, try millions.

17:55.474 --> 17:57.075
- Millions!

17:57.142 --> 17:59.178
{\an1}Millions!

18:01.847 --> 18:03.248
No, capitalism is bad.

Socialism, good.

- You're right.
- Yes.

18:17.496 --> 18:19.031
- I am a revolutionary.
- Yes.

- Yes!

18:23.969 --> 18:25.604

I know it's real tobacco.
I just don't care, okay?

By Q2, I want every

18:57.636 --> 19:00.138
Have you overthrown the evil
capitalist regime yet?

19:00.205 --> 19:02.274
- Um...

19:02.341 --> 19:03.642
Very close.

19:03.709 --> 19:05.344
I would say very, very close.

You know, I learned a little
Spanish in high school, so...

19:41.113 --> 19:42.514
- Oh, that's so cool.
- Mm.

19:42.581 --> 19:44.416

19:48.153 --> 19:49.755
all my double-mesh canvas.

- Aw.
- Are you a yarn-head?

19:50.956 --> 19:52.224
I don't mean to assume.
- I am.

19:52.291 --> 19:53.892
I'm also thinking about getting
into candlestick making, so...

20:00.065 --> 20:01.900
Good luck.
- Cool.

20:03.602 --> 20:05.370
- Oh, I love that Sauvignon.

20:05.437 --> 20:06.705

- Oh.
- And also,

20:58.457 --> 21:00.325
{\an1}try pivoting to something
other than needlepoint.
