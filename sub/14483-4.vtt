Hello, Zapp?

WELL, WELL, WELL.

ZAPP, WE'RE OUT OF FUEL.

18:57.203 --> 18:59.005

We need your help.

LIKE A BIRD ON ITS BELLY.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.278
DELICIOUS.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.851
LOOK, ARE YOU GOING
TO RESCUE US OR NOT?

19:11.884 --> 19:14.253
Can't you ask
a little more sexfully?

19:21.027 --> 19:22.394
CERTAINLY.

19:22.429 --> 19:24.497
BUT FIRST YOU'LL HAVE
TO GET RID OF THAT THING.

[ Coos ]
That's the law, Leela.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.568
AND BRANNIGAN'S LAW
IS LIKE BRANNIGAN'S LOVE--

19:29.602 --> 19:31.136
HARD AND FAST.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.807
Now put that greasy rat outside
and we'll tow you to safety.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.743
I WOULD NEVER ABANDON
A HELPLESS ANIMAL.

19:37.777 --> 19:41.413
YOU KNOW, ZAPP, ONCE I THOUGHT
YOU WERE A BIG, POMPOUS BUFFOON.

19:41.448 --> 19:44.851
THEN I REALIZED THAT INSIDE,
YOU WERE JUST A PITIFUL CHILD.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.153
BUT NOW I REALIZE
THAT OUTSIDE THAT CHILD

19:47.185 --> 19:48.654
IS A BIG, POMPOUS BUFFOON.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.523
And which one rocked your world?

THAT GUY OFF.

19:55.261 --> 19:57.263
NOW WHAT'S YOUR
SECRET ESCAPE PLAN?

19:57.297 --> 20:00.767
UH... I GUESS TO SIT HERE
AND WAIT FOR DEATH.

20:00.799 --> 20:03.001
CAN DO.

I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.211
IT'S DARK MATTER.

20:13.246 --> 20:15.781
SO THIS GUY JUST UNLOADED
A STEAMING PILE

20:15.815 --> 20:17.115
OF STARSHIP FUEL?

20:17.148 --> 20:20.619
HIS SPECIES MUST HAVE FILLED
THE ENTIRE PLANET WITH IT.

YOU CUTE LITTLE--

20:25.090 --> 20:26.259
COME ON.

20:26.292 --> 20:27.859
THAT SHOULD BE MORE
THAN ENOUGH FUEL

20:27.894 --> 20:29.095
TO GET US OUT OF HERE.

AND PUT IT IN THE ENGINE.

20:56.355 --> 20:57.789

20:58.825 --> 21:01.227
AND SOME
OF THE ANIMALS SURVIVED.

SO A COUPLE OF ANIMALS

21:03.162 --> 21:05.731
DIDN'T DIE,
AND LEELA GOT LUCKY.

21:13.373 --> 21:16.107
I MAY NOT HAVE FOUND LOVE
ON THIS MISSION

A CUTE LITTLE COMPANION

WHAT MAN HAS DREAMT OF
