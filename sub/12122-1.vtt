01:02.684 --> 01:07.320
Hi-hi, there-there.
Hey-hey nice-nice out-outfit.

01:57.039 --> 02:00.140
Ahh. Ha ha.

02:00.142 --> 02:02.542
Here you are.

02:02.544 --> 02:04.077
Ha ha ha.

02:04.079 --> 02:05.712
Ha ha ha.

02:10.551 --> 02:13.420
Give me a dollar.

02:15.824 --> 02:17.190
Excuse me.

02:17.192 --> 02:18.258
Excuse me.

02:19.428 --> 02:21.227
King Kong, come here.

02:21.229 --> 02:23.630
Come on.

02:32.507 --> 02:34.707
Ha ha ha ha.

02:39.281 --> 02:42.215
I didn't see anything weird.

02:43.852 --> 02:45.251
Thank you.

02:45.253 --> 02:46.719
Thank you.

02:46.721 --> 02:49.422
You're too kind.

02:56.431 --> 02:59.432
I need a word with you, pal.

03:00.335 --> 03:03.269
Who is you? I'm busy.

03:03.338 --> 03:07.373
Too busy to make $50,000?

03:08.710 --> 03:10.543
Show's over, folks!

03:10.545 --> 03:13.279
Aww! Aww!

03:30.432 --> 03:31.898
Sit.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.900
Over there.

03:48.150 --> 03:51.618
Oh, hey, I want my gold watch.

03:51.620 --> 03:54.821
Come on, pal, over here.

04:17.879 --> 04:19.279
Which one?

04:19.281 --> 04:19.812
Which one?

04:19.814 --> 04:22.215
Drake, this ape's a genius.

04:22.217 --> 04:23.550
It's a monkey,

04:23.552 --> 04:25.685
and I'm the genius, not him.

04:25.687 --> 04:28.621
Is it true you do
burglaries with that,

04:28.623 --> 04:29.789
uh... Little ape?

04:29.791 --> 04:30.490
True?

04:30.492 --> 04:32.492
That's what we do best.

04:32.494 --> 04:34.594
Is that how I'm gonna
make 50 grand?

04:34.596 --> 04:37.330
Ah, we'll talk
about that later.

04:37.332 --> 04:38.231
First,

04:38.233 --> 04:40.667
we need a little
demonstration...

04:40.669 --> 04:42.468
Free of charge.

05:31.419 --> 05:33.720
Ahh.

05:43.999 --> 05:45.498
¶ Out came the sun ¶

05:45.500 --> 05:48.034
¶ and dried up all the rain ¶

05:48.036 --> 05:51.638
¶ and the itsy-bitsy
spider... ¶

05:53.508 --> 05:56.309
Yay.

06:05.587 --> 06:08.655
You don't talk much.
You don't talk at all.

06:08.657 --> 06:09.956
But you're my bright boy.

06:09.958 --> 06:12.292
Do you think he's
going to say anything?

06:12.294 --> 06:13.726
Say "dada."

06:17.632 --> 06:18.464
Come on, dad.

06:18.466 --> 06:20.900
He's break dancing.
Look at this.

06:28.977 --> 06:29.842
Eva's home.

06:29.844 --> 06:32.078
Come on, let's go see your sis.

06:32.080 --> 06:34.314
Let's go see your sis.

06:38.887 --> 06:40.019
Hi. Peter, come on in.

06:40.021 --> 06:41.421
Thank you. Just for a sec.

06:41.423 --> 06:44.090
She's getting a little
picture she made for me.

06:44.092 --> 06:45.391
Oh, sure, sure.

06:45.393 --> 06:45.792
Hey, Peter.

06:45.794 --> 06:48.861
How are you? Beautiful.
So how are we?

06:51.433 --> 06:54.734
Mom: Oh, did you
get my message...

06:54.736 --> 06:56.636
Peter: Yes.

07:00.875 --> 07:03.076
Scram, Jack!

07:16.524 --> 07:17.824
Dad!

07:17.826 --> 07:19.058
I'm ready for you!

07:19.060 --> 07:21.427
Jack: Coming, sweetheart.

07:23.665 --> 07:26.966
Oh, search and destroy,
eh, Jacko?

07:33.408 --> 07:34.507
That's me...

07:34.509 --> 07:35.541
Uh-huh.

07:35.543 --> 07:36.442
That's you.

07:36.444 --> 07:37.510
Handsome as ever, yeah.

07:37.512 --> 07:40.146
An excellent rendition
here in the middle.

07:40.148 --> 07:41.981
This is a rottweiler, dad.

07:41.983 --> 07:43.950
They're the greatest dogs.

07:43.952 --> 07:46.052
It says here. Look.

07:46.054 --> 07:47.053
He could be our dog.

07:47.055 --> 07:50.123
I can see that you've
researched it.

07:50.125 --> 07:52.625
Look, eva, airline pilots
don't have dogs.

07:52.627 --> 07:54.927
We travel too much.
No problemo.

07:54.929 --> 07:58.664
When you're flying, he
could stay here with me.

07:58.666 --> 08:00.099
Baby...

08:00.101 --> 08:01.501
How many times do you
have to hear it?

08:01.503 --> 08:06.439
You can't keep a dog here
'cause of your stepdad.

08:06.441 --> 08:10.410
It's not my fault if he's
allergic to animal hair.

08:10.412 --> 08:11.177
Ohh.

08:11.179 --> 08:14.781
Come on, it's not
his fault, either.

08:16.518 --> 08:19.519
See? I told youse.

08:19.921 --> 08:26.426
I trained him to pick gold,
jewelry, cash, silver.

08:26.428 --> 08:28.828
So, what?

08:28.830 --> 08:31.564
It's a monkey,
not an appraiser.

08:31.566 --> 08:35.134
So what do you say?

08:35.135 --> 08:36.535
This is perfect
for the mahler score.

08:36.538 --> 08:40.106
Anything goes wrong, only the
monkey's there to take the heat.

08:40.107 --> 08:41.640
He's gonna love it.

08:41.643 --> 08:44.010
The monkey... He'll love it.

08:44.011 --> 08:46.446
Who's he?

08:46.548 --> 08:48.080
Let's give this guy
a down payment.

08:48.082 --> 08:51.017
I gotta hunch we're gonna
do business with him.

08:51.019 --> 08:54.120
Hey, let's do
some business here.

08:54.122 --> 08:56.489
Drake: Don't fool around.
Give him the money.

08:56.491 --> 08:57.924
I had it right here, Drake.
I had it here.

08:57.926 --> 08:59.592
What do you mean you had it?

08:59.594 --> 09:01.828
I had it right here.

09:05.733 --> 09:07.767
Ha ha ha ha ha.

09:07.769 --> 09:10.036
Hey, you know what this is?

09:10.038 --> 09:12.939
It's your down payment.
You earned it.

09:12.941 --> 09:14.507
Ha ha ha ha.

09:15.043 --> 09:17.977
My school nurse says people
can get over their allergies.

09:17.979 --> 09:21.214
Sometimes having a dog around
makes their body get used to it.

09:21.216 --> 09:23.749
Tom's allergy isn't
the only reason.

09:23.751 --> 09:29.555
Eva, you're not responsible
enough to care for a dog.

09:29.557 --> 09:32.058
You need a diaper.

09:32.260 --> 09:35.895
Look, you never listen
to a word I say.

09:35.897 --> 09:38.731
Your room is a complete
disaster area.

09:38.733 --> 09:42.969
You never get anything
done on time.

09:43.071 --> 09:46.606
Here, would you
throw this out for me?

09:46.608 --> 09:49.008
No, stanks.

09:51.546 --> 09:53.212
If you can't even deal
with a dirty diaper,

09:53.214 --> 09:57.149
how are you going
to clean up after a dog?

09:57.151 --> 10:01.087
Because, mom, I'd be doing
it for my own puppy.

10:01.089 --> 10:04.657
Well, how about doing this
for your own brother?

10:04.659 --> 10:07.727
Do I have to? I'm eating.

10:07.729 --> 10:09.061
He can do it himself.

10:09.063 --> 10:11.531
Well, a dog won't be able
to feed himself.

10:11.533 --> 10:14.267
You'll have to do it
twice a day.

10:14.269 --> 10:14.901
I know.

10:14.903 --> 10:18.905
How about this? You going to
give up your favorite TV shows

10:18.907 --> 10:23.576
when the dog needs
to go for a walk?

10:23.578 --> 10:24.110
Eva, listen.

10:24.112 --> 10:27.747
If you really think you can
handle it, then convince us.

10:27.749 --> 10:30.149
Start helping out
more around here,

10:30.151 --> 10:31.851
pick up after yourself.

10:31.853 --> 10:33.619
And then, if I do all that,

10:33.621 --> 10:34.987
will you let me...
Honey, tom, look.

10:34.989 --> 10:38.691
He's doing itsy-bitsy spider.
Have...

10:38.693 --> 10:40.927
A dog?

10:40.929 --> 10:42.728
¶ The itsy-bitsy spider ¶

10:42.730 --> 10:43.896
¶ climbed up the waterspout ¶

10:43.898 --> 10:51.604
¶ down came the rain and
washed the brother out ¶

10:51.606 --> 10:53.105
eva...

11:01.616 --> 11:02.782
Eva...

11:02.784 --> 11:05.718
Your brother loves you so much.

11:05.720 --> 11:06.719
That's fine.

11:06.721 --> 11:09.822
I just don't want you
to love him so much.

11:09.824 --> 11:12.959
You think everything
he does is so precious.

11:12.961 --> 11:15.328
I hate him. He's a nerd.

11:16.698 --> 11:18.264
I'll tell you what.

11:18.266 --> 11:20.967
Why don't I pack
his bag right now,

11:20.969 --> 11:22.234
I'll leave him on
the street tonight,

11:22.236 --> 11:24.670
and we'll just hope somebody
really nice finds him

11:24.672 --> 11:25.838
and takes care of him.

11:25.840 --> 11:29.976
Come on, mom. Just shoot him.

11:40.121 --> 11:42.154
They tooked everything!

11:42.156 --> 11:45.157
She took the TV!

11:45.159 --> 11:47.293
She even took my fricking food!

12:02.977 --> 12:04.276
Aaahh...

12:04.278 --> 12:06.979
What do you want?

12:10.885 --> 12:14.687
The little jerk's...

12:14.689 --> 12:15.388
Gone!

12:16.357 --> 12:19.725
She left and
tooked him with her,

12:19.727 --> 12:21.894
because of you.

12:21.896 --> 12:23.295
She hated you

12:23.297 --> 12:26.198
and your stinking mess!

12:26.434 --> 12:30.236
And she hated me
for keeping you around!

12:31.773 --> 12:34.006
You don't believe me?!

12:37.045 --> 12:38.277
Read!

12:43.851 --> 12:45.685
Now get over it!

12:45.687 --> 12:48.020
We got work to do.

12:52.760 --> 12:53.793
Amy, calm down.

12:53.795 --> 12:55.761
Don't touch anything.

12:55.763 --> 12:56.829
Ohh...

12:56.831 --> 12:58.230
Uhh...

12:59.000 --> 13:02.768
My grandmother's pin and
the ring you gave me.

13:02.770 --> 13:04.036
Ah-choo!

13:04.706 --> 13:06.072
Ah-choo!

13:06.074 --> 13:07.239
Uhh!

13:07.842 --> 13:08.841
The cash in your purse,

13:08.843 --> 13:11.477
was it large bills or small?

13:11.479 --> 13:12.778
Uh...

13:12.780 --> 13:13.746
J-just singles. Why?

13:13.748 --> 13:16.315
This guy wasn't a pro. Breaking
in with us in the other room,

13:16.317 --> 13:20.086
he goes for your good jewelry,
but also grabs worthless junk,

13:20.088 --> 13:21.454
grabs the singles
in your purse,

13:21.456 --> 13:24.724
but misses the "c" note
in my wallet?

13:24.726 --> 13:27.460
And to rip off
a police lieutenant?

14:33.261 --> 14:35.227
Amy: Eva?

14:36.297 --> 14:37.463
Eva, you're late.

14:37.465 --> 14:40.132
What... what are you doing?
Get dressed.

14:40.134 --> 14:42.501
Mom, all this stuff
looks disgusting on me.

14:42.503 --> 14:46.939
Do we have to do this
every single morning?

14:55.316 --> 14:57.316
Hey, look at that!

15:19.006 --> 15:20.606
Hey, guys.

15:22.243 --> 15:24.376
Eva, that's enough. I said no.

15:24.378 --> 15:25.311
Hi, eva. Hi.

15:25.313 --> 15:27.446
You're not coming in today?

15:27.448 --> 15:29.048
Later.

15:47.034 --> 15:50.469
Well, this is my dog Toto and
I named him after the dog...

15:50.471 --> 15:51.604
eva: Do you feed him?

15:51.606 --> 15:54.440
Do you walk him? Do you
clean up his poop?

15:54.442 --> 15:55.941
Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha.

15:55.943 --> 15:59.245
No. Actually, my mom
does most of that stuff.

15:59.247 --> 16:01.046
Then he's not really yours.

16:01.048 --> 16:02.081
Wanna bet? He is so mine!

16:02.083 --> 16:05.451
Only until your parents decide he's
a big pain and get rid of him.

16:05.453 --> 16:07.920
They're not gonna
get rid of him.

16:07.922 --> 16:08.587
Eva, please.

16:08.589 --> 16:10.055
Now, it's Jesse's time to talk.

16:10.057 --> 16:12.524
Do you want us to pay attention
tomorrow when it's your turn?

16:12.526 --> 16:16.362
Tomorrow? I can't
do it tomorrow.

16:16.364 --> 16:17.296
I'm not ready. I forgot.

16:17.298 --> 16:20.065
Now, that's what you've
been saying all month, eva.

16:20.067 --> 16:23.002
Remember, we agreed that you
were going to be more organized,

16:23.004 --> 16:25.104
you were gonna
follow a schedule.

16:25.106 --> 16:27.139
Now, you can do this.
I have faith in you.

16:27.141 --> 16:30.476
Try to prepare something for
show and tell next month,

16:30.478 --> 16:32.511
ok?

16:32.513 --> 16:33.612
Go on, Jesse.

16:33.614 --> 16:36.315
I like to dress him up a lot,
and he's got like little...

16:36.317 --> 16:40.486
I have nothing to show. I have nothing to tell.
What am I gonna do?

16:40.488 --> 16:43.455
That's easy. You can always
bring your brother.

16:43.457 --> 16:46.158
My brother? Forget it.

16:46.160 --> 16:47.259
Never.

16:47.261 --> 16:49.328
Jesse: This is about it.

17:05.046 --> 17:08.146
Gypsy: It's a machine.
You know what to do.

17:08.683 --> 17:10.214
Drake: Anybody home?
Anybody home?

17:10.217 --> 17:14.053
Get up, you bum! You struck gold.
Your monkey's got a job.

17:14.055 --> 17:15.521
Now call me, all right?

17:15.522 --> 17:17.690
I want you to call me
right away.

17:17.692 --> 17:19.625
The big boss wants to meet you.

17:22.329 --> 17:24.296
Yes!

18:43.544 --> 18:45.611
Ohh... Ha.

18:46.180 --> 18:48.614
Oh, Harold, look at
that little monkey.

18:48.616 --> 18:52.217
That's quite a pet you've
got there, young lady.

18:52.219 --> 18:53.519
Does it bite?

18:53.521 --> 18:55.454
I hope not.

18:58.059 --> 18:59.391
Well, where did you get it?

18:59.393 --> 19:03.328
From some... in the
Caribbean, some pirates.

19:03.330 --> 19:06.298
There's still pirates
in the Caribbean?

19:06.300 --> 19:10.536
You know, retired ones.
They own a restaurant now.

19:10.538 --> 19:12.204
Man: What's its name?

19:12.206 --> 19:13.472
It's name? Uh...

19:13.474 --> 19:15.240
Dodger, 'cause
he likes the hat.

19:15.242 --> 19:16.775
Oh, he's a dodger...

19:16.777 --> 19:19.278
he's a dodger fan.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.547
Oh, it's so wonderful... ohh!

19:21.549 --> 19:24.683
Man: Is he always
so friendly to strangers?

19:24.685 --> 19:27.219
Sometimes, occasionally.

19:27.221 --> 19:29.488
Now he's coming to see me.

19:29.490 --> 19:31.623
Oh, look at him go.

19:31.625 --> 19:33.258
Oh, look at that.

19:33.260 --> 19:34.326
Ha ha ha.

19:34.328 --> 19:35.227
Isn't he something?

19:35.229 --> 19:38.097
Well, thank you, little girl.
That's very nice.

19:38.099 --> 19:39.264
Oh, Harold...

19:39.266 --> 19:40.599
Look at this!

19:42.203 --> 19:44.269
You scared him.

19:47.241 --> 19:51.243
Hey, little dude,
are you all right?

19:53.380 --> 19:58.217
Did you run away from the zoo
or the circus or something?

20:01.755 --> 20:04.323
My name's eva.

20:04.325 --> 20:07.726
How did you come
to me like that?

20:08.662 --> 20:09.728
Ohh...

20:12.566 --> 20:13.699
Ha ha.

20:13.701 --> 20:16.568
Ok, you're mine now, all right?

20:17.338 --> 20:19.671
Is that what you want?

20:24.445 --> 20:25.577
Oh...

20:28.682 --> 20:30.382
Excuse me.

20:34.455 --> 20:37.856
Shh. It's ok. It's ok. Shh.

20:37.858 --> 20:39.558
I know. The bulldog
scared you, didn't he?

20:39.560 --> 20:43.896
But now you have to be really
good and don't move, ok?

20:43.898 --> 20:44.696
Promise?

20:44.698 --> 20:46.798
Ok.

20:46.800 --> 20:47.533
You're so cute.

20:47.535 --> 20:50.169
What would really help,
lieutenant, just find some photos

20:50.171 --> 20:52.404
of the 2 jewelry items...
you know, family snapshots,

20:52.406 --> 20:54.473
anything... I can blow them up.

20:54.475 --> 20:55.574
Yeah. We'll dig something up.

20:55.576 --> 20:57.743
Eva, wait. What are you doing?
It's just cates.

20:57.745 --> 21:01.513
Hey, eva. What's up?
Oh, not much.

21:02.216 --> 21:03.615
Ok. See you later. Bye.

21:03.617 --> 21:05.484
Call me when those
lab reports come in.

21:05.486 --> 21:06.952
Right. Will do. Thanks, guys.

21:06.954 --> 21:09.221
All right. See you.

21:09.223 --> 21:12.724
You think we should
tell her what happened?

21:12.726 --> 21:13.892
I don't know.

21:13.894 --> 21:15.894
I really don't want
to scare her

21:15.896 --> 21:19.464
with the idea of a robber
sneaking into the house.

21:24.805 --> 21:26.538
This is my room.

21:34.381 --> 21:37.849
Yeah. You're my secret.

21:38.252 --> 21:41.920
Amy: Sweetheart?

21:42.890 --> 21:44.456
Good. You're cleaning.

21:44.458 --> 21:45.290
Mm-hmm.

21:45.292 --> 21:47.392
You want a snack or anything?

21:47.394 --> 21:47.993
Mm-mmm.

21:47.995 --> 21:51.330
Sure? All right. Keep it up.

21:53.701 --> 21:56.501
That was close.

22:01.408 --> 22:02.474
What's wrong?

22:02.476 --> 22:06.545
You trying to tell me something?
You, uh...

22:08.315 --> 22:09.815
Uh... You...

22:11.986 --> 22:14.753
You need to go pee? Yuck.

22:15.956 --> 22:17.389
Gross.

22:23.931 --> 22:27.299
No pee-pee on the floor,
dodger. No.

22:27.301 --> 22:29.001
Bad. No good.

22:37.478 --> 22:39.478
Yuck.

22:43.350 --> 22:46.418
Eva? Katie for you.

22:46.420 --> 22:47.919
I'm in the bathroom!

22:48.589 --> 22:49.921
Honey, I got
the phone right here.

22:49.923 --> 22:53.492
You want me to leave it, or
you want to hold, or what?

22:53.494 --> 22:56.061
I can't! I'm on the toilet!

22:56.063 --> 22:58.463
On the toilet!

23:00.701 --> 23:02.034
Ah-choo!

23:02.036 --> 23:02.634
Uhh!

23:02.636 --> 23:04.369
She's in... she's in the toilet.

23:04.371 --> 23:06.638
She'll have to call you back.

23:06.640 --> 23:08.006
Ah-choo!

23:08.008 --> 23:09.875
Ah-choo!!

23:14.515 --> 23:16.481
Ewww!

23:23.624 --> 23:25.924
Yeah, right.

23:35.969 --> 23:36.968
What do you want?

23:36.970 --> 23:39.338
Don't you dare
talk to me like that.

23:39.340 --> 23:43.742
How'd you find us? She knows
you're here, she'll kill you!

23:43.744 --> 23:45.010
I'm not after her.

23:45.012 --> 23:46.812
Woman: Who is it?!

23:46.814 --> 23:47.713
It's nobody!

23:47.715 --> 23:49.581
So now I'm a nobody?

23:49.583 --> 23:52.050
You were always a nobody.

23:55.089 --> 23:56.555
Where's my monkey?

23:56.557 --> 23:57.589
You don't know?

23:57.591 --> 23:58.824
Who you talking to there?

23:58.826 --> 24:01.393
I'm talking to myself!

24:01.395 --> 24:02.828
Is the monkey here,
or ain't he?

24:02.830 --> 24:05.630
Of course not! She'd never
let me keep him around.

24:05.632 --> 24:07.733
Phehh! Why? What happened?
You lost him?

24:07.735 --> 24:09.901
I can't believe it.
You lost him.

24:09.903 --> 24:14.840
I didn't lost him.
I just can't find him.

24:16.076 --> 24:17.909
Tell that ungrateful...

24:17.911 --> 24:19.778
Mother of yours

24:19.780 --> 24:21.413
that nobody...

24:21.882 --> 24:24.383
Is becoming somebody.

24:25.018 --> 24:25.784
Here.

24:25.786 --> 24:28.987
Get yourself new sneakers.

24:32.693 --> 24:34.025
Mmm...

24:34.027 --> 24:36.428
There you go.

24:36.430 --> 24:37.963
Hey, you look cute.

24:45.973 --> 24:48.707
What, you don't like it?

24:50.444 --> 24:51.576
Dinner's ready.

24:52.112 --> 24:53.945
The sign says "keep
out" on the door.

24:53.947 --> 24:56.448
Can't you at least knock?

24:56.450 --> 24:58.917
I'll be there in a sec.

24:58.919 --> 25:01.520
You'll be there now.

25:01.522 --> 25:02.854
Come on.

25:03.090 --> 25:05.490
We assume the zoo
would be the logical place

25:05.492 --> 25:06.057
to report a lost monkey,

25:06.059 --> 25:11.196
so I wanted yez... youse... uh,
you to know where to reach me.

25:11.198 --> 25:12.497
Yeah.

25:12.499 --> 25:15.867
It's Dr. Benjamin Stevenson.

25:15.869 --> 25:20.839
Eva, Mr. Daily said you wouldn't
let his dog in the elevator today.

25:20.841 --> 25:21.640
What's this about?

25:21.642 --> 25:23.975
I couldn't, mom. If that
dog got hair all over me,

25:23.977 --> 25:28.113
just think how bad it would
be for tom's allergy.

25:28.115 --> 25:31.783
As it is, I've been
sneezing all afternoon.

25:31.785 --> 25:33.084
See?

25:33.086 --> 25:33.952
Thanks.

25:56.510 --> 25:57.108
Hello?

25:57.110 --> 25:58.510
Yeah. Just a minute.

25:58.512 --> 25:59.678
Eva, it's for you. It's Katie.

25:59.680 --> 26:04.549
Amy: Tell her just for a sec.
We're having dinner.

26:11.992 --> 26:15.760
Katie: Hey. Hi. Can
you keep a secret?

26:15.996 --> 26:19.231
No. I mean really
swear to keep it.

26:19.233 --> 26:21.833
No, I don't have a crush
on anybody, Katie.

26:21.835 --> 26:23.668
This is serious!

26:24.605 --> 26:26.972
Oh, my God. I gotta go.

26:26.974 --> 26:30.008
I'll call you
tomorrow at school.

26:30.010 --> 26:32.244
Go! Go!

26:39.119 --> 26:40.785
What are you doing?

26:40.787 --> 26:44.256
I'm just, uh,
you know, I'm voguing.

26:44.258 --> 26:45.690
Yeah.

26:47.060 --> 26:48.827
Ah-choo!

26:48.829 --> 26:49.761
Jeez!

26:50.197 --> 26:52.964
Sorry. Your mother wants
you back at the table.

26:52.966 --> 26:53.832
Come on.

26:53.834 --> 26:54.599
Ohhh!

26:54.601 --> 26:57.936
Tom: Amy, I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.

26:57.938 --> 27:00.105
Amy: Oh, honey...

27:03.076 --> 27:04.142
Tom: Got a tissue?

27:04.144 --> 27:05.944
Amy: Yeah. Here you go.
Oh, sweetie.

27:05.946 --> 27:09.281
You sure you don't want to try
some of that herbal tea?

27:09.283 --> 27:12.284
I'm telling you,
it really works.

27:16.557 --> 27:18.690
Well, uh, I'm gonna
go eat in my room.

27:18.692 --> 27:22.093
Please excuse me
from the table. Bye.

27:23.664 --> 27:24.863
What's up with her?

27:24.865 --> 27:27.165
I don't know,
but I was surprised

27:27.167 --> 27:29.134
what she said earlier
about your allergy?

27:29.136 --> 27:31.303
I mean, she was
really concerned.

27:31.305 --> 27:33.672
Yeah. Maybe she's finally
accepting the fact

27:33.674 --> 27:36.608
she can't have a pet.

27:38.178 --> 27:39.878
There we go.

27:40.013 --> 27:40.912
Do you like chicken?

27:40.914 --> 27:44.149
Shoot! I forgot a knife.

28:10.077 --> 28:12.777
You don't like chicken?

28:15.949 --> 28:19.150
Oh! You don't like forks!

28:24.057 --> 28:25.724
Do you like that?

28:25.726 --> 28:27.626
Is that good?

28:30.964 --> 28:32.297
Sweetie, your show's on.

28:32.299 --> 28:36.768
I can't! I'm busy!
I'm doin' my homework!

29:11.738 --> 29:13.838
Good morning, mom.

29:14.274 --> 29:15.874
What are you staring at?

29:15.876 --> 29:17.175
You cleaned your room!

29:17.177 --> 29:19.010
And... You're dressed.
Look at you.

29:19.012 --> 29:22.113
I'm supposed to learn
responsibility, remember?

29:22.115 --> 29:25.050
Come on. Let's get some breakfast.
I'm starved.

29:25.052 --> 29:26.017
Honey.

29:26.019 --> 29:27.318
Oh, honey.

29:27.888 --> 29:30.355
It's so clean, eva.

29:32.926 --> 29:34.259
Tom.

29:34.261 --> 29:35.160
Mmm...

29:35.162 --> 29:36.227
What time is it?

29:36.229 --> 29:38.196
Something's up with eva.

29:38.198 --> 29:40.065
She just left for school.

29:40.067 --> 29:42.801
No, no. You're not late.
You're not late.

29:42.803 --> 29:46.237
She and Paul went a
half an hour early.

29:47.407 --> 29:48.006
Oh.

29:48.008 --> 29:50.108
Now, last night, she gave
up her favorite show

29:50.110 --> 29:51.476
so she could do her homework.

29:51.478 --> 29:53.978
And when I went in to
wake her this morning,

29:53.980 --> 29:55.413
she was washed,
she was dressed,

29:55.415 --> 29:56.815
the bed was made,
the room was perfect.

29:56.817 --> 30:00.218
Not one thing out of place.
And then at breakfast,

30:00.220 --> 30:03.388
she asked me how Jack was
doing on his toilet training.

30:03.390 --> 30:08.293
She was really interested
in how I was teaching him.

30:09.362 --> 30:11.296
Then she made her own lunch...

30:11.298 --> 30:14.933
With 2 bananas and
an extra sandwich.

30:16.470 --> 30:18.336
Sounds like she met a guy.

30:18.338 --> 30:23.975
That would explain the 2 bananas
and the extra sandwich.

30:23.977 --> 30:24.743
Right.

30:24.745 --> 30:27.812
And she's teaching this
guy how to use the potty?

30:27.814 --> 30:30.982
Whee! Ha ha ha!

30:31.518 --> 30:33.151
Ha ha ha ha!

30:33.153 --> 30:35.019
Ha ha ha!

30:47.067 --> 30:49.100
Wow.

30:52.038 --> 30:53.505
Woman: So are you gonna go
to the meeting tonight?

30:53.507 --> 30:56.407
I'd like to, but I don't
have a babysitter.

30:56.409 --> 30:57.876
Oh, I have somebody.

30:57.878 --> 31:01.379
Oh, well, Jack never gets home
until 9:00.

31:01.381 --> 31:03.214
Why don't you call me?

31:05.886 --> 31:06.851
Katie. Come on, let's go.

31:06.853 --> 31:11.222
No. Let's wait for eva. She has
something really important to tell me.

31:11.224 --> 31:15.293
Ok. You're my friend.
She can tell you, too.

31:19.032 --> 31:20.131
Hi, Annie.

31:20.133 --> 31:20.799
Hi, eva.

31:20.801 --> 31:22.300
Want to see your puppy?

31:22.302 --> 31:25.003
No. What can I do for you?

31:25.005 --> 31:26.304
I want...

31:33.313 --> 31:34.445
A capuchin.

31:34.447 --> 31:37.282
A cu... What?

31:37.284 --> 31:39.317
He's a capuchin, isn't he?

31:39.319 --> 31:40.885
Eva, where did you get him?

31:40.887 --> 31:43.388
Um, my father got him
from the Caribbean

31:43.390 --> 31:44.923
from some pirate or something.

31:44.925 --> 31:48.259
But... Can I ask you a question?
The only thing is,

31:48.261 --> 31:51.296
will he grow up to be like a
big gorilla or something?

31:51.298 --> 31:56.067
Ha ha! No. I'd probably
say he's fully grown now.

31:56.069 --> 31:57.936
Yes! Ha ha ha! Ok, see,

31:57.938 --> 32:01.105
he's a surprise present
for my mom.

32:01.107 --> 32:02.874
But my dad wants me
to train him first.

32:02.876 --> 32:08.913
So could you keep him here, you know,
while I'm at school and stuff?

32:15.255 --> 32:17.488
There she is! Let's go!

32:18.358 --> 32:19.390
Eva!

32:19.392 --> 32:19.958
Eva!

32:19.960 --> 32:22.360
We've all been waiting
to hear the news.

32:22.362 --> 32:23.061
What happened?

32:23.063 --> 32:26.331
News? It's not news!
It's a secret!

32:26.333 --> 32:30.468
All: We won't tell anyone!
We promise!

32:30.470 --> 32:31.903
Ok, eva.

32:32.339 --> 32:34.939
Go inside, all of you.

32:34.941 --> 32:36.107
Just go!

32:36.109 --> 32:40.445
You can't listen
to our secret. Go. Go!

32:40.447 --> 32:41.946
Go!

32:42.082 --> 32:44.282
There. What is it?

32:44.284 --> 32:47.585
Come on. I won't tell, I swear.

32:47.587 --> 32:49.254
Katie, I can't tell you.

32:49.256 --> 32:51.456
If I tell you and you
tell one other person,

32:51.458 --> 32:52.423
it could ruin everything.

32:52.425 --> 32:57.228
Ruin what? Maybe I can help you.
I am your best friend.

32:57.230 --> 33:00.598
Help me? I told you
I have a secret,

33:00.600 --> 33:03.234
and you tell the whole class.

33:03.236 --> 33:06.304
You're not my friend anymore.

33:08.408 --> 33:11.643
Great best friend, Katie.

33:12.579 --> 33:14.612
You said you saw a monkey?

33:14.614 --> 33:16.581
Yes. In this park?

33:16.583 --> 33:17.515
Yes.

33:17.517 --> 33:20.285
I knew he couldn't
have gone too far.

33:20.287 --> 33:21.486
Yes!

33:24.391 --> 33:26.958
Do you speak English?

33:26.960 --> 33:28.126
No.

33:34.034 --> 33:37.435
Tessa, stop.
Wait here a minute, ok?

33:40.340 --> 33:42.407
He was a big hit around here.

33:42.409 --> 33:44.342
Ha ha ha! The funniest thing

33:44.344 --> 33:47.078
is how he loves
the cash register.

33:47.080 --> 33:48.246
I couldn't keep him
away from it.

33:48.248 --> 33:52.050
He thinks it's the
greatest toy in the world.

33:53.086 --> 33:55.520
Come on, dodger, get in.

34:05.398 --> 34:06.497
Hi.

34:06.666 --> 34:07.598
My teacher sent me.

34:07.600 --> 34:10.268
I need all the books
you have on monkeys.

34:10.270 --> 34:16.341
Uh-huh. All monkeys
or a specific species?

34:16.342 --> 34:18.576
I think I need a... Cappuccino.

34:18.578 --> 34:20.745
Oh, sweetheart,
I need one, too,

34:20.746 --> 34:24.716
but we don't have a
cappuccino machine here.

34:26.418 --> 34:29.087
Do children drink that stuff?

34:35.328 --> 34:36.260
Whoa!

34:37.263 --> 34:38.496
This specific species.

34:38.498 --> 34:41.733
The name sounds
like cappuccino?

34:43.737 --> 34:48.005
Ok. I'm sure we have
something here for you.

34:48.007 --> 34:49.172
"Black howler."

34:49.175 --> 34:49.741
Uh, "debrazza."

34:49.743 --> 34:51.708
"Capuchin." That sounds
like cappuccino,

34:51.710 --> 34:54.178
no doubt about it, huh? Ok.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.147
Yes. Ok.

34:56.149 --> 34:56.714
Uh... Uh...

34:56.716 --> 34:58.016
Thank you.

34:58.018 --> 35:00.718
Uh... Oh! I'm sorry.
We... we have, uh...

35:00.720 --> 35:02.053
Where do I look? No. No.

35:02.055 --> 35:03.154
I'm gonna get it
for you, all right?

35:03.156 --> 35:05.256
I'll even make copies,
uh, uh, for both of you

35:05.258 --> 35:08.192
so you won't even
have to come back.

35:08.194 --> 35:10.194
Dodger, get in.

35:21.408 --> 35:23.641
"Capuchins live
in tropical forests.

35:23.643 --> 35:26.611
"They eat fruit,
dry seeds, eggs,

35:26.613 --> 35:29.280
insects, spiders..."

35:29.282 --> 35:30.615
Ewww!

35:31.317 --> 35:34.318
"Small animals, such
as lizards... " yuck!

35:34.320 --> 35:36.154
No way I'm letting
you eat lizards.

35:36.156 --> 35:39.524
From now on, you're
on a low-yuck diet.

35:39.526 --> 35:41.159
"The mother carries the infant

35:41.161 --> 35:43.127
"until it can travel
safely on its own.

35:43.129 --> 35:48.066
The father may carry
the young on its back."

35:48.068 --> 35:48.599
Hmm.

35:48.601 --> 35:50.835
We're not that different.

35:51.104 --> 35:54.839
"The females in the social group
may mate with different males.

35:54.841 --> 35:59.210
Members may leave,
and new members join in."

36:02.582 --> 36:06.150
We're not different at all!

36:11.324 --> 36:16.494
It's ok. He can't rat on us.
He can't even talk.

36:19.232 --> 36:20.531
Hey, Jack.

36:21.201 --> 36:23.568
You want to meet somebody?
Wait here, ok?

36:23.570 --> 36:26.871
Come on out, dodger.
Come on out. Come on.

36:28.441 --> 36:29.373
See?

36:29.375 --> 36:30.141
Isn't he cute?

36:30.143 --> 36:33.878
Look. He's wearing a diaper,
just like you. See?

36:34.581 --> 36:38.449
Don't worry, dodger.
This is my brother Jack.

36:38.785 --> 36:40.885
Jack, dodger. Dodger, Jack.

36:40.887 --> 36:46.457
You stay here and play while I
read the rest of this stuff, ok?

36:48.261 --> 36:50.261
Be good, dodger.

36:51.197 --> 36:54.398
Eva: "Capuchins are at home
in areas rich with trees.

36:54.400 --> 36:59.137
They spend most of their time
up in the branches."

37:02.408 --> 37:04.275
Oh! Oh! Get it off me!

37:04.277 --> 37:05.409
Sorry!

37:05.411 --> 37:08.312
He's mine. Don't worry.
Come here.

37:08.314 --> 37:10.615
Oh, just take him, honey.

37:10.617 --> 37:11.716
I'm sorry.

37:11.718 --> 37:12.717
Ohh...

37:12.719 --> 37:13.784
Ohhh...

37:13.786 --> 37:15.386
Sorry.

37:16.222 --> 37:17.255
Ohh...

37:17.257 --> 37:18.256
Sorry.

37:18.258 --> 37:19.524
Ohhh...

37:22.428 --> 37:24.829
"Some monkeys are
afraid of water.

37:24.831 --> 37:27.665
All monkeys
are afraid of snakes."

37:27.667 --> 37:29.233
Hmm.

37:32.272 --> 37:35.406
Oh, don't be a sissy.

37:38.244 --> 37:40.611
"The adult monkeys
spend much time

37:40.613 --> 37:42.680
"grooming one another's fur.

37:42.682 --> 37:45.316
"They enjoy
this physical contact,

37:45.318 --> 37:49.921
which is also described
as social grooming."

38:17.283 --> 38:18.216
Yeah!

38:26.459 --> 38:27.692
Shh.

38:31.297 --> 38:33.531
Tom. Come here, sweetie.

38:33.533 --> 38:35.333
Come see this.

38:35.335 --> 38:36.567
Look.

38:39.872 --> 38:42.974
What have we done, right?
Honey, this is major.

38:42.976 --> 38:45.409
Yeah. Oh, sweetheart.

38:46.546 --> 38:50.681
Eh, uh... It says
"only Jack allowed."

38:50.683 --> 38:52.783
I'm her mother.

39:22.348 --> 39:22.680
Mom!

39:22.682 --> 39:25.049
Honey. Honey.
It's just me. It's ok.

39:25.051 --> 39:26.851
You're just having
a bad dream, sweetheart.

39:26.853 --> 39:30.454
Lay down. There you go.
Go back to sleep.

39:30.456 --> 39:33.291
Go back to sleep. Good girl.

39:33.293 --> 39:36.294
Good night, baby.

39:43.403 --> 39:44.669
Dodger.

39:44.671 --> 39:45.803
Are you ok?

39:45.805 --> 39:47.638
Where are you?

39:47.640 --> 39:49.674
Oh, ok. Good night.

39:53.680 --> 39:54.779
Bye, eva.

39:54.781 --> 39:55.980
Bye.

40:05.825 --> 40:06.924
Thank you.

40:06.926 --> 40:08.592
Annie?

40:08.594 --> 40:09.894
Yes?

40:10.330 --> 40:13.064
I have to go to my dad's
for the weekend, and...

40:13.066 --> 40:13.798
that's great.

40:13.800 --> 40:17.835
So you won't have to worry
about hiding dodger, right?

40:17.837 --> 40:20.838
Uhhh... Right.

40:25.478 --> 40:26.777
Want to go to the park?

40:26.779 --> 40:30.481
I can't. I have to
go home and think.

40:30.483 --> 40:33.451
How can I leave him here?

40:34.020 --> 40:36.454
What should I tell dad?

40:38.658 --> 40:40.991
How can I make this better?

40:43.463 --> 40:44.128
Hello.

40:44.130 --> 40:46.630
Eva: Me and dad one on one
for 2 whole days.

40:46.632 --> 40:50.668
It's going to be
impossible. Oh, dodger.

40:50.670 --> 40:53.504
Eva, your dad's on the phone!

40:56.642 --> 40:58.676
Eva, did you hear me?

40:58.678 --> 41:01.645
Don't come in here. I'm coming!

41:01.881 --> 41:06.016
What am I going to do?
I'm ok. Stay calm.

41:06.018 --> 41:08.552
Hey, maybe I shouldn't be ok.

41:08.554 --> 41:10.454
Sick! Toxic! 104!

41:10.456 --> 41:14.759
Hey, pal, stay here.
I'll be right back.

41:17.730 --> 41:18.863
Hello, dad.

41:18.865 --> 41:21.165
Peter: Baby, what's wrong?
You sound awful.

41:21.167 --> 41:22.700
Oh, I feel awful.

41:22.702 --> 41:26.637
Oh. Well, then maybe I don't
have such bad news after all.

41:26.639 --> 41:28.072
Bad news? What bad news?

41:28.074 --> 41:31.776
Well, I was calling to say
I can't see you this weekend.

41:31.778 --> 41:33.644
Yeah. See, they switched
my flight schedule all around

41:33.646 --> 41:35.413
just a few hours ago...
it was a last-minute thing...

41:35.415 --> 41:40.184
and I'm already at the airport, and I
have to be in Vancouver till Monday.

41:40.186 --> 41:41.852
Anyway, if you're so sick...

41:41.854 --> 41:43.521
Oh, I'm feeling better. Thanks.

41:43.523 --> 41:46.657
Listen, sweetheart. I'll make
it up to you, ok? I mean it.

41:46.659 --> 41:48.993
Don't worry. Don't worry.
I love you.

41:48.995 --> 41:49.994
I love you, too, baby.

41:49.996 --> 41:54.465
Now hang up and let me leave a message for mom, ok?
I'm gonna call back.

41:54.467 --> 41:56.066
Bye.

42:00.606 --> 42:02.840
Amy, listen, it's Peter.

42:02.842 --> 42:03.974
Um, I know this is last-minute,

42:03.976 --> 42:07.812
but they switched my flight
schedule all around, as per usual,

42:07.814 --> 42:09.580
and I have to fly to
Vancouver this weekend,

42:09.582 --> 42:12.149
so I really need you
to cover for me with eva.

42:12.151 --> 42:14.685
Um, I'll make it up to you.
I appreciate it.

42:14.687 --> 42:17.955
Have a great weekend
with eva. Bye-bye. Thanks.

42:17.957 --> 42:21.692
Machine: I will
erase your message.

42:27.900 --> 42:28.699
Hello?

42:28.701 --> 42:29.633
Eva: Katie, it's me.

42:29.635 --> 42:30.901
I'm not speaking to you.

42:30.903 --> 42:34.805
Who cares? I want
to talk to your mom.

42:34.807 --> 42:37.174
Oh, so what's the scoop
for the weekend?

42:37.176 --> 42:38.075
Oh, I'm going to dad's.

42:38.077 --> 42:41.645
Yeah, Tessa told me that he called,
but I didn't get a message.

42:41.647 --> 42:43.481
Oh, I took care of everything.

42:43.483 --> 42:46.183
Yeah, he said he'll
be waiting for me.

42:46.185 --> 42:49.653
Oh, mom, Katie's going to
the beach for the weekend,

42:49.655 --> 42:53.090
so she can drop me
off if you want.

42:53.259 --> 42:57.495
It's a good idea. I'll
call missy after dinner.

42:57.497 --> 42:57.895
Hi!

42:57.897 --> 42:59.196
So glad you're doing this.

42:59.198 --> 43:01.732
No, that's ok. I'll just
take it in back.

43:01.734 --> 43:02.700
All right.

43:02.702 --> 43:03.901
Uh, excuse me.

43:03.903 --> 43:05.002
Ok.

43:05.004 --> 43:06.070
Bye.

43:06.072 --> 43:07.905
That baby is getting so big.

43:07.907 --> 43:11.609
I know. Thanks again.

43:11.611 --> 43:16.146
Say bye-bye. Say bye-bye.

43:21.787 --> 43:24.021
Hey, what's the matter
with you guys?

43:24.023 --> 43:26.023
You're so quiet.

43:26.025 --> 43:29.026
Maybe we don't have anything
to say to each other.

43:29.028 --> 43:31.729
¶ I gotta bust my mind,
I got a bus ticket ¶

43:31.731 --> 43:34.231
¶ gotta do it right now,
gotta put on the man ¶

43:34.233 --> 43:36.667
¶ I sure look funny,
but I got lots of money ¶

¶ spending lots of my time

don't scream.

44:20.880 --> 44:22.079
That's better.

44:22.081 --> 44:24.148
Would you please get
back in your seats

44:24.150 --> 44:25.115
and put your seat belts on?

44:25.117 --> 44:28.786
He's so cool.
You found him in the park?

44:28.788 --> 44:32.022
¶ Girls to the left,
girls to the right ¶

44:32.024 --> 44:34.625
¶ cruisin' in my trucktop,

44:45.871 --> 44:47.171
bye!

44:47.173 --> 44:49.273
Have fun!

44:54.080 --> 44:57.047
Dodger, you don't have to hide.
Come on, get out.

44:59.285 --> 45:01.285
That's easy.

45:04.190 --> 45:06.624
There we go.

45:07.793 --> 45:10.194
Oh, no! It's locked!

45:10.196 --> 45:12.696
But he never locks it.

45:13.265 --> 45:17.067
That's it. We're locked out.

45:33.719 --> 45:37.788
He's totally trying
to get us in!

46:04.383 --> 46:08.085
Dodger, let me in!

46:08.954 --> 46:11.055
Let me in.

46:15.327 --> 46:17.394
You're unreal!

46:20.700 --> 46:21.999
Now it opens!

46:22.001 --> 46:25.936
Come on, dodger. Let's go get some food.
I'm starved.

46:27.073 --> 46:30.774
He didn't shop because
he wasn't going to be here.

46:31.811 --> 46:36.280
And I didn't bring any money
because I'm stupid.

46:43.456 --> 46:45.756
Yummy.

46:57.436 --> 46:59.937
Everybody on the
boardwalk does it.

46:59.939 --> 47:04.408
Dodger, let's go make money.

47:27.933 --> 47:30.033
Boy, you're really excited.

47:30.035 --> 47:32.402
I knew you'd love it here.

47:45.184 --> 47:48.252
No, dodger!

47:48.254 --> 47:50.120
No!

47:50.322 --> 47:52.189
Come on.

47:52.191 --> 47:53.991
You don't have
to hide down here.

47:53.993 --> 47:57.461
Hey, today, you're going to
be the special attraction.

47:57.463 --> 48:00.164
Come on. Come on out. Good boy.

48:00.166 --> 48:02.499
Come on, good. There you go.

48:02.501 --> 48:04.368
Enjoy yourself.

48:04.370 --> 48:07.571
Is this place
too crowded for you?

48:07.573 --> 48:10.040
Why are you so scared?

48:10.042 --> 48:12.376
Bet you've never been
to a beach before, huh?

48:12.378 --> 48:16.146
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

48:33.199 --> 48:35.432
That's the echo man.
Let's go check him out.

48:35.434 --> 48:40.571
Echo man: Ask not what your
country can do for you...

48:40.573 --> 48:45.576
Ask what you can do
for your country.

48:48.581 --> 48:52.382
Boy, he's good, huh?
Let's go back on the path.

49:21.380 --> 49:22.946
Man: Hey!

49:28.287 --> 49:31.555
Oh, jeez!

49:58.183 --> 49:59.917
Where did you go?!

49:59.919 --> 50:02.085
Stop!

50:02.321 --> 50:03.654
Move!

50:41.460 --> 50:42.726
You all right?

50:42.728 --> 50:44.094
Please get my skateboard.

50:44.096 --> 50:45.329
Don't worry. I'll go get it.

50:45.331 --> 50:47.531
Thank you, jackass.

51:05.517 --> 51:07.017
Stop!

51:32.745 --> 51:36.313
That's my monkey!
Don't let him fall!

51:39.218 --> 51:41.251
Give me those! Give me those!

51:41.253 --> 51:44.588
I hate your face! Gimme those.

52:26.198 --> 52:29.199
Aah! Sit still.

52:42.481 --> 52:43.513
Where the hell you been?

52:43.515 --> 52:44.581
You're supposed
to stay in touch,

52:44.583 --> 52:46.116
let us know how
the training's going.

52:46.118 --> 52:48.585
Does it got to be now?
Training's great.

52:48.587 --> 52:52.255
I'm trying to get in shape myself.
Jogging, you see?

52:52.257 --> 52:53.690
Come here.

52:53.692 --> 52:57.294
I got the boss breathing down my
neck about this monkey thing now.

52:57.296 --> 53:01.665
I'm about to lose my job.
I gotta know.

53:02.634 --> 53:04.868
Can I depend on you?

53:05.704 --> 53:06.336
I'm sorry.

53:06.338 --> 53:08.839
I didn't want you to worry.
The monkey gots a cold.

53:08.841 --> 53:10.207
What do you mean a cold?

53:10.209 --> 53:10.807
Nothing serious.

53:10.809 --> 53:12.742
We was training at the vet's.

53:12.744 --> 53:14.211
It's all under control.

53:14.213 --> 53:16.780
Control? What are you
talking about? Hey, whoa!

53:16.782 --> 53:20.150
Come here. How sick is he?

53:52.151 --> 53:55.852
Dodger, I can't do this.

54:14.206 --> 54:15.605
Eva: Dodger!

54:16.842 --> 54:17.474
Oh, eh...

54:17.476 --> 54:19.809
Oh, no, thanks.
I don't take cameras.

54:19.811 --> 54:21.945
Cash only. Understand?

54:21.947 --> 54:24.714
You take picture, please?

54:24.716 --> 54:28.185
Oh, ok, sure.

54:34.560 --> 54:36.193
Here you go.

54:36.195 --> 54:38.728
Thank you. Bye-bye.

54:38.730 --> 54:40.497
Thank you.

54:42.701 --> 54:45.535
A whole dollar?!

54:45.537 --> 54:47.337
Dodger!

54:47.339 --> 54:49.272
A buck!

54:49.274 --> 54:52.475
Whoo! Yes!

55:03.956 --> 55:05.822
Thanks.

55:05.824 --> 55:06.489
Thank you.

55:06.491 --> 55:07.958
From the pirates
of the Caribbean...

55:07.960 --> 55:12.462
Give a hand to dodger...
the best monkey in the world!

55:12.464 --> 55:15.465
Pet him for a quarter.
Pictures for a buck.

55:15.467 --> 55:17.801
Rub his head and get good luck.

55:17.803 --> 55:19.502
Not my head, the monkey's.

55:19.504 --> 55:22.606
My wallet's gone!
I had it right here.

55:22.608 --> 55:24.774
I had it right here.

55:30.015 --> 55:32.415
There was a pickpocket
in the crowd.

55:32.417 --> 55:33.750
I saw him. He was right here!

55:33.752 --> 55:38.388
Did you see him? Yeah, there
was a guy standing right here.

55:38.390 --> 55:39.456
Let's go this way.

55:39.458 --> 55:43.026
Dodger, it's ok. We got enough.

55:43.028 --> 55:45.795
You're brilliant,
you know that?

55:49.901 --> 55:51.601
Mr. Big wants to see a dry run

55:51.603 --> 55:53.970
before we get anywhere
near the mahler estates.

55:53.972 --> 55:56.640
See? That's it there.

55:56.642 --> 55:57.407
Right there.

55:57.409 --> 55:59.409
The old broad kicked off
and left behind

55:59.411 --> 56:02.045
a fortune in
rare coins and jewels.

56:02.047 --> 56:02.979
The estate sale's Thursday.

56:02.981 --> 56:06.383
We'll let them get organized,
lay out the goods,

56:06.385 --> 56:07.884
then the monkey will drop in

56:07.886 --> 56:10.587
and do some shopping
Wednesday night.

56:10.589 --> 56:14.057
I can handle Wednesday.

56:18.830 --> 56:19.529
Stop it!

56:19.531 --> 56:22.465
They know my daddy here.

56:33.011 --> 56:35.078
Cash, check, or credit card?

56:35.080 --> 56:36.846
Huh?

56:36.848 --> 56:38.948
Just regular money.

56:43.689 --> 56:44.454
19.85, please.

56:44.456 --> 56:48.058
Boy: Do you want a separate
bag for these, ma'am?

57:01.873 --> 57:04.941
Here's your change, ma'am.

57:04.943 --> 57:05.942
Little girl,

57:05.944 --> 57:08.745
can I see what you got
in your backpack?

57:08.747 --> 57:09.612
No. Why?

57:09.614 --> 57:10.380
I know her dad.

57:10.382 --> 57:12.782
He's got a charge account here.

57:12.784 --> 57:14.884
I just want to see
what you got inside.

57:14.886 --> 57:16.720
It's personal.

57:16.722 --> 57:17.487
Where's your dad?

57:17.489 --> 57:19.756
He's at the store
across the street.

57:19.758 --> 57:20.790
What's going on?

57:20.792 --> 57:24.127
I think this little girl
has been shoplifting.

57:24.129 --> 57:26.596
No, no! You have it wrong!

57:26.598 --> 57:28.498
I didn't steal anything.

57:28.500 --> 57:32.068
Then why don't you want me
to look into your backpack?

57:32.070 --> 57:34.137
Huh?

57:34.139 --> 57:35.905
Hmm?

57:43.148 --> 57:44.514
Look, hon...

57:44.516 --> 57:46.583
We all make mistakes.

57:46.585 --> 57:48.718
All I want you to do
is walk up an aisle,

57:48.720 --> 57:52.889
and if there's anything you forgot
to pay for in your backpack,

57:52.891 --> 57:54.090
just leave it there.

57:54.092 --> 57:58.495
If you do, I'll forget
this entire thing.

58:05.437 --> 58:09.739
He must have an animal
detector or something.

58:13.845 --> 58:16.079
Oh, dodger.

58:18.817 --> 58:21.084
What have you done?

58:24.089 --> 58:26.456
You made me a thief.

58:50.048 --> 58:53.049
Get back to work.

58:53.652 --> 58:55.752
Why did you have to do that?

58:55.754 --> 58:56.653
Huh?

58:58.890 --> 59:03.159
If they caught you,
I'd have to get rid of you.

59:03.161 --> 59:05.795
Don't kiss up to me now.

59:06.164 --> 59:09.866
You have no idea
what you did, do you?

59:23.081 --> 59:24.647
Yeah, you should
hide in there...

59:24.649 --> 59:29.552
And think about what a bad
little monkey you've been.

59:38.763 --> 59:39.796
Oh, my God.

59:39.798 --> 59:43.700
This is from those people
at the beach.

59:57.582 --> 59:58.948
Oh, my God!

59:58.950 --> 01:00:01.718
This is horrible!

01:00:04.856 --> 01:00:07.724
He's a break-in artist, too.

01:00:07.726 --> 01:00:11.561
He knew exactly how
to get in this house.

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:25.875
I bet you don't even know
what stealing means.

01:00:25.877 --> 01:00:30.980
The books never said anything
about you being a thief.

01:00:30.982 --> 01:00:35.785
You do it because it's how
somebody taught you.

01:00:35.787 --> 01:00:39.656
Whoever it was, I hate them.

01:00:40.692 --> 01:00:45.194
I'm going to dis-teach you.

01:00:45.664 --> 01:00:47.263
Starting tomorrow,

01:00:47.265 --> 01:00:48.698
I will dis-teach you

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:53.636
to unlearn everything
those jerks taught you.

01:00:59.244 --> 01:01:00.977
Ok, dodger.

01:01:01.246 --> 01:01:03.980
I want you
to take this bag here

01:01:03.982 --> 01:01:06.082
and fill it with toys.

01:01:06.084 --> 01:01:08.618
Toys... happy things.

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:10.119
Ok?

01:01:33.044 --> 01:01:36.112
This is not going to be easy.

01:01:36.114 --> 01:01:38.281
I said the <i> toys.</i>

01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:46.889
Come here.

01:01:47.759 --> 01:01:49.692
This is <i> no!</i>

01:01:49.694 --> 01:01:51.027
No good, dodger!

01:01:51.029 --> 01:01:51.794
No!

01:01:51.796 --> 01:01:53.930
This is good. Yes!

01:02:01.106 --> 01:02:03.306
My monkey, yeah,
on the little girl's bike.

01:02:03.308 --> 01:02:05.008
Did you see where they went?

01:02:05.010 --> 01:02:06.042
Yeah, they, uh...

01:02:06.044 --> 01:02:08.077
They were going
towards Ralph's.

01:02:16.921 --> 01:02:18.154
That's no!

01:02:18.156 --> 01:02:19.088
No!

01:02:19.090 --> 01:02:20.657
That's bad! No!

01:02:20.659 --> 01:02:22.258
She put the monkey
in her backpack.

01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:23.793
In front of the market.

01:02:23.795 --> 01:02:24.761
Which market?

01:02:24.763 --> 01:02:25.862
That one. There.

01:02:25.864 --> 01:02:27.430
This is good.

01:02:27.432 --> 01:02:28.431
Yes.

01:02:28.433 --> 01:02:29.666
Good.

01:02:29.668 --> 01:02:30.400
Good.

01:02:30.402 --> 01:02:31.901
This? Yucky.

01:02:31.903 --> 01:02:32.835
No good.

01:02:32.837 --> 01:02:34.270
This is good.

01:02:34.272 --> 01:02:35.338
Yeah.

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:36.239
Yes.

01:02:36.241 --> 01:02:37.373
Good. Good.

01:02:37.375 --> 01:02:38.307
Good.

01:02:43.948 --> 01:02:46.783
Don't... Move.

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.294
Uh!

01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:01.998
Don't think about it, Buster.

01:03:07.205 --> 01:03:08.204
Hey!

01:03:08.206 --> 01:03:09.305
Put it back!

01:03:11.976 --> 01:03:14.210
I said no!

01:03:30.962 --> 01:03:33.029
Can you imagine?

01:03:33.031 --> 01:03:34.297
She stole from me,

01:03:34.299 --> 01:03:35.164
totally ripped me off.

01:03:35.166 --> 01:03:39.335
I caught her in here yesterday
trying to shoplift.

01:03:39.337 --> 01:03:40.403
My boss let her go.

01:03:40.405 --> 01:03:43.406
Didn't even tell her dad.

01:03:44.008 --> 01:03:46.509
Gee, if I knew
where she lived...

01:03:46.511 --> 01:03:49.145
I'd go talk to her old man.

01:03:49.147 --> 01:03:49.846
Right now.

01:03:49.848 --> 01:03:52.115
Well, I know him. He's single.

01:03:52.117 --> 01:03:53.416
I mean, he's divorced.

01:03:53.418 --> 01:03:56.119
He has a charge account here.

01:03:56.121 --> 01:03:58.955
I can get you the address.

01:03:59.858 --> 01:04:02.091
227 hillcrest.

01:04:02.093 --> 01:04:03.960
Hold on.

01:04:04.496 --> 01:04:08.197
Dad, you still in the shower?

01:04:09.134 --> 01:04:10.433
He can't pick up right now.

01:04:10.435 --> 01:04:14.337
But he said just...
Bring the cab.

01:04:14.339 --> 01:04:18.207
Ok. Bye. Thanks.

01:04:44.435 --> 01:04:45.935
Huh?

01:04:46.971 --> 01:04:50.473
It can't be
the cab guy already.

01:04:50.475 --> 01:04:53.209
I just called them.

01:04:53.812 --> 01:04:58.347
Maybe if we just ignore
them, they'll go away.

01:04:58.349 --> 01:05:01.184
Hello?

01:05:01.186 --> 01:05:02.885
Are you there?

01:05:03.888 --> 01:05:06.823
Anybody home?

01:05:07.225 --> 01:05:09.358
Hey.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:10.359
What... What's wrong?

01:05:10.361 --> 01:05:13.563
Why are you so scared?
You're shaking all over.

01:05:13.565 --> 01:05:14.497
Shh!

01:05:14.499 --> 01:05:16.199
Shh! It's ok.

01:05:16.201 --> 01:05:17.233
Ok. Shh!

01:05:17.235 --> 01:05:17.600
Come on.

01:05:17.602 --> 01:05:21.103
We'll go downstairs,
take a peek.

01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.889
Aah!

01:05:40.925 --> 01:05:43.125
It's the pirate!

01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:46.896
Open up!

01:05:46.898 --> 01:05:48.564
I need to talk to you!

01:05:48.566 --> 01:05:50.166
Dad, come down here!

01:05:50.168 --> 01:05:52.969
Someone's trying to get in!

01:05:54.539 --> 01:05:57.473
Get your father, girl!

01:05:59.410 --> 01:06:01.444
He's busy!

01:06:01.646 --> 01:06:05.481
Or maybe he ain't there at all!

01:06:19.264 --> 01:06:22.531
Come on, dodger. Come with me.

01:06:26.905 --> 01:06:29.038
Little girl...

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:31.274
Don't be afraid.

01:06:31.376 --> 01:06:35.411
I only want to talk with you.

01:06:37.248 --> 01:06:40.683
Where are you, darlin'?

01:07:01.205 --> 01:07:05.074
I'm running
out of patience here!

01:07:22.727 --> 01:07:25.361
What are you doing?

01:07:38.309 --> 01:07:39.575
He's here!

01:07:39.577 --> 01:07:42.311
Dodger, get in!

01:07:42.313 --> 01:07:43.980
Driver!

01:07:43.982 --> 01:07:44.380
Wait!

01:07:44.382 --> 01:07:48.217
Bye, dad! See you
in a couple of weeks!

01:07:48.219 --> 01:07:50.619
Yikes!

01:07:52.056 --> 01:07:53.089
Go!

01:07:53.091 --> 01:07:54.423
We don't take minors.

01:07:54.425 --> 01:07:55.257
Company rules.

01:07:55.259 --> 01:07:59.128
I'm not a minor!
I'm in a major hurry!

01:07:59.130 --> 01:08:00.629
Please... Go!

01:08:00.631 --> 01:08:02.465
You got money?

01:08:05.336 --> 01:08:07.036
Right here. See?

01:08:07.038 --> 01:08:08.337
Ok.

01:08:08.339 --> 01:08:09.705
Go!

01:08:13.077 --> 01:08:14.744
Bye, dad!

01:08:19.216 --> 01:08:24.319
Please don't find me! Please don't find me!
No, no, no, no, no!

01:08:32.095 --> 01:08:33.662
Go faster! Go!

01:08:33.663 --> 01:08:35.564
How much faster?

01:08:35.566 --> 01:08:37.265
This much!

01:08:54.519 --> 01:08:56.085
Ohh!

01:09:03.627 --> 01:09:05.127
Ah-aah!

01:09:05.129 --> 01:09:06.261
Ah...

01:09:06.264 --> 01:09:07.662
Aah!

01:09:11.402 --> 01:09:13.301
Awesome!

01:09:23.113 --> 01:09:25.648
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

01:09:31.622 --> 01:09:32.822
Ha ha ha!

01:09:32.823 --> 01:09:34.390
It worked!

01:09:38.830 --> 01:09:41.596
They're beeping me.

01:09:41.698 --> 01:09:44.265
Must be my lawyer.

01:09:44.268 --> 01:09:46.669
I'll be right back.

01:09:53.810 --> 01:09:54.877
Woman: Hello?

01:09:54.879 --> 01:09:55.845
Who's this?

01:09:55.847 --> 01:09:57.446
I beg your pardon?

01:09:57.448 --> 01:09:58.380
Did you beep me?

01:09:58.382 --> 01:09:59.849
Oh, is this Dr. Stevenson?

01:09:59.851 --> 01:10:04.253
We've paged you in reference
to your missing monkey.

01:10:04.255 --> 01:10:04.753
Oh, yes.

01:10:04.755 --> 01:10:07.790
Dr. Stevenson... speaking.

01:10:08.326 --> 01:10:09.425
Hi, sweetheart. Where's Peter?

01:10:09.427 --> 01:10:12.828
He was, uh, late for a game or something.
Where's mom?

01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:15.764
She's with Jack
over at nanny's party.

01:10:15.766 --> 01:10:17.733
Wait. You dropped something.

01:10:17.735 --> 01:10:18.667
What is this?

01:10:18.669 --> 01:10:22.471
I don't know. How am I supposed to know?
It's not mine.

01:10:22.473 --> 01:10:23.806
Ok.

01:10:23.808 --> 01:10:24.807
I'm just tired.

01:10:24.809 --> 01:10:27.243
I'm watching the ball game.
You want to watch with me?

01:10:27.245 --> 01:10:30.913
It's the... your Dodgers
are playing the pirates.

01:10:32.183 --> 01:10:33.249
What?

01:10:33.251 --> 01:10:35.151
What's wrong?

01:10:35.153 --> 01:10:38.320
Uh, the first time was
right here in the park,

01:10:38.322 --> 01:10:39.488
with the little girl...

01:10:39.490 --> 01:10:43.159
And the same day,
mother lost her earrings.

01:10:43.161 --> 01:10:44.860
Sounds like
it could be my monkey.

01:10:44.862 --> 01:10:47.496
Do you know
where the girl lives?

01:10:47.498 --> 01:10:50.166
I'm afraid we don't.

01:10:50.168 --> 01:10:52.668
You said you saw the monkey
the first time.

01:10:52.670 --> 01:10:54.170
When was the second time?

01:10:54.172 --> 01:10:55.871
Uh, th-that was
at the pet store,

01:10:55.873 --> 01:10:58.340
uh, right down
the street there.

01:11:01.179 --> 01:11:04.213
He doesn't look like a doctor.

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:56.565
Amy...

01:11:56.567 --> 01:11:58.367
Something's up with eva.

01:11:58.369 --> 01:12:00.269
I did something
I thought was ok,

01:12:00.271 --> 01:12:02.771
but only it turned out
not to be ok.

01:12:02.773 --> 01:12:04.240
And now it's out of control,

01:12:04.242 --> 01:12:07.376
and I want to undo it,
but I don't know how.

01:12:07.378 --> 01:12:08.844
No matter what you've done,

01:12:08.846 --> 01:12:11.347
you have to tell your parents.

01:12:11.349 --> 01:12:14.450
Go to your mom
and you talk to her.

01:12:14.452 --> 01:12:16.585
Don't be afraid.

01:12:18.556 --> 01:12:20.923
I've been lying too much.

01:12:20.925 --> 01:12:22.725
Well, then, telling the truth

01:12:22.727 --> 01:12:26.528
is the only way
to make it better.

01:12:26.530 --> 01:12:28.030
Ok?

01:12:38.409 --> 01:12:40.576
No, no, no. Store closed.

01:12:40.578 --> 01:12:41.710
You can't come in.

01:12:41.712 --> 01:12:44.446
I'm just going to get my monkey.
Who are you?

01:12:44.448 --> 01:12:47.416
I am from the
laundromat next door.

01:12:47.418 --> 01:12:47.983
Where's Annie?

01:12:47.985 --> 01:12:51.587
She's not here. She had to go to
the police station in a hurry.

01:12:51.589 --> 01:12:52.021
What happened?

01:12:52.023 --> 01:12:55.391
Some guy came in here
and stole from her.

01:12:56.727 --> 01:12:58.394
Where's my monkey?!

01:12:58.396 --> 01:13:00.729
I don't know anything
about any monkey!

01:13:00.731 --> 01:13:02.431
Dodger!

01:13:02.433 --> 01:13:04.900
Dodger!

01:13:05.036 --> 01:13:07.469
Annie was keeping
my monkey for me!

01:13:07.471 --> 01:13:11.006
All I know is some horrible man
came in, stole some things,

01:13:11.008 --> 01:13:11.907
got her terribly upset,

01:13:11.909 --> 01:13:15.377
and she had to run off and
report it all to the police.

01:13:15.379 --> 01:13:16.378
He found us.

01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:20.382
He came and took
my poor little dodger.

01:13:20.384 --> 01:13:21.984
Dodger.

01:13:24.689 --> 01:13:27.623
If you help me, I'll
give you more money.

01:13:27.625 --> 01:13:29.425
Yeah, right.

01:13:29.427 --> 01:13:31.560
Cross my heart.

01:13:31.562 --> 01:13:33.395
Right now, he's mad at me.

01:13:33.397 --> 01:13:34.697
He's all worked up.

01:13:34.699 --> 01:13:37.866
I need you to calm him down.

01:13:42.907 --> 01:13:44.773
Mom?

01:13:53.951 --> 01:13:55.351
Mom.

01:13:55.353 --> 01:13:55.718
Eva.

01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:59.788
I need to talk to you.
I'm in such big trouble.

01:14:01.392 --> 01:14:05.494
Yeah, I'd say you were
in trouble, eva.

01:14:05.496 --> 01:14:08.364
Amy: We found it in your room.

01:14:12.903 --> 01:14:16.538
I never saw this stuff
before, mom.

01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:18.741
I didn't steal anything.

01:14:20.411 --> 01:14:22.511
It's my monkey.

01:14:22.513 --> 01:14:23.679
My monkey did it.

01:14:23.681 --> 01:14:25.147
Eva, what are you
talking about?

01:14:25.149 --> 01:14:26.749
We haven't seen any monkey.

01:14:26.751 --> 01:14:28.550
That's because
I've been hiding him.

01:14:28.552 --> 01:14:31.720
And then I found out that
he steals like a maniac.

01:14:31.722 --> 01:14:35.090
And today I went to go pick
him up at the pet shop,

01:14:35.092 --> 01:14:36.859
but the trainer...

01:14:36.861 --> 01:14:37.993
He took him back.

01:14:37.995 --> 01:14:38.927
My poor dodger.

01:14:38.929 --> 01:14:41.663
I tried to stop him from stealing,
but he wouldn't and then...

01:14:41.665 --> 01:14:45.834
Tom, could you please help me?
Please, I really need your help.

01:14:45.836 --> 01:14:46.735
Eva,

01:14:46.737 --> 01:14:47.536
sweetheart,

01:14:47.538 --> 01:14:48.670
start from the beginning,

01:14:48.672 --> 01:14:50.839
and it's best to tell
us the truth, ok?

01:14:50.841 --> 01:14:53.008
It is the truth!

01:14:53.010 --> 01:14:53.642
No!

01:14:53.644 --> 01:14:56.578
Ok. I'll call the pet shop.

01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:57.446
Yeah, sure.

01:14:57.448 --> 01:15:00.983
No, no, no, no, no! Wait...

01:15:00.985 --> 01:15:01.984
The man who is there now

01:15:01.986 --> 01:15:03.752
doesn't know anything
about my monkey,

01:15:03.754 --> 01:15:05.954
'cause Ann had to leave
after the pirate...

01:15:05.956 --> 01:15:08.957
eva, that's enough.
Just stop it!

01:15:12.897 --> 01:15:15.664
Ho ho ho ho! There he is!
On time!

01:15:15.666 --> 01:15:16.765
Ha ha ha ha!

01:15:18.035 --> 01:15:20.903
This is it, my friend.

01:15:20.905 --> 01:15:21.603
One step away.

01:15:21.605 --> 01:15:23.205
Charlie, give him the jewels
so he can practice.

01:15:23.207 --> 01:15:27.676
All the boss wants to do
is see the monkey in action.

01:15:27.678 --> 01:15:30.479
Loot for the demo.

01:15:36.954 --> 01:15:40.055
Get over here.
Why did he do that?

01:15:40.057 --> 01:15:41.723
Why did you did that?

01:15:41.725 --> 01:15:43.926
What's wrong with you?

01:15:51.535 --> 01:15:55.971
This ain't time for joking around.
Ha ha ha ha!

01:16:02.646 --> 01:16:05.047
You guys got a wallet?

01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:14.790
Drake: What's
going on here, huh?

01:16:14.792 --> 01:16:16.892
He's ready for you guys.

01:16:16.894 --> 01:16:18.060
Ju-just a second.

01:16:18.062 --> 01:16:19.928
Now, Drake.

01:16:25.135 --> 01:16:26.835
Don't move.

01:16:37.548 --> 01:16:38.180
Drake: Relax.

01:16:38.182 --> 01:16:39.781
Please let me show you.

01:16:39.783 --> 01:16:41.717
He's right out here.

01:16:46.891 --> 01:16:48.524
Hey, uh, boss...

01:16:48.526 --> 01:16:51.093
Boss, we got a problem.

01:17:01.906 --> 01:17:04.006
What did she do to him?

01:17:04.008 --> 01:17:06.975
Years of training wrecked.

01:17:06.977 --> 01:17:09.845
Wait till I get
my hands on her.

01:17:09.847 --> 01:17:11.914
Of course I haven't
seen a monkey.

01:17:11.916 --> 01:17:16.952
She hasn't seen him because I've
been hiding him in my backpack.

01:17:22.293 --> 01:17:23.025
Hey, Amy.

01:17:23.027 --> 01:17:24.293
Peter. What are you doing here?

01:17:24.295 --> 01:17:25.928
Peter: I was just in the
neighborhood doing errands,

01:17:25.930 --> 01:17:28.063
and I thought since I'd
missed eva on the weekend,

01:17:28.065 --> 01:17:30.766
what do you mean, missed her?
I'd pick her up...

01:17:30.768 --> 01:17:33.969
Amy, I was flying all
over Canada last weekend.

01:17:33.971 --> 01:17:36.338
You didn't get my message?

01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:38.273
What's wrong?

01:17:39.810 --> 01:17:42.711
Peter: Amy, what's going on?

01:17:43.647 --> 01:17:50.218
Where have you been this weekend
while your father was out of town?!

01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:51.954
At his house.

01:17:51.956 --> 01:17:52.354
What?

01:17:52.356 --> 01:17:56.224
I just wanted to spend some
time alone with my monkey.

01:17:56.226 --> 01:17:58.093
What monkey?
Sweetheart, where are...

01:17:58.095 --> 01:17:59.628
Peter, she's been
stealing all over town

01:17:59.630 --> 01:18:02.598
and blaming it on some
imaginary, invisible monkey.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:04.266
Eva: Mom, I'm telling you,
he is real!

01:18:04.268 --> 01:18:08.170
Eva, go to your room, and
I want you to stay there

01:18:08.172 --> 01:18:10.238
until you're ready
to tell us the truth.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:12.774
But, mom... just go!

01:18:25.022 --> 01:18:25.954
Excuse me, sir.

01:18:25.956 --> 01:18:29.124
Something just jumped out
of the back of your truck.

01:18:29.126 --> 01:18:29.825
My monkey?!

01:18:29.827 --> 01:18:32.094
Yeah, it was your monkey.
He ran into the park.

01:18:32.096 --> 01:18:33.161
Hey, wait! Wait!

01:18:38.268 --> 01:18:40.268
I'm open!

01:18:50.214 --> 01:18:53.048
Peter: But eva has
always been so honest.

01:18:53.050 --> 01:18:53.982
That's the thing.

01:18:53.984 --> 01:18:56.385
I don't think she's ever lied
to us before, do you?

01:18:56.387 --> 01:18:59.021
Amy: It's not like her.
She's not a thief.

01:18:59.823 --> 01:19:02.224
Amy: I just can't believe
that she would steal from me.

01:19:02.226 --> 01:19:03.258
Peter: I can't, either.

01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.160
Well, I've got the evidence,

01:19:05.162 --> 01:19:06.995
but it doesn't add up
for me, either.

01:19:06.997 --> 01:19:10.999
Amy: I just find this monkey
really hard to believe.

01:19:12.703 --> 01:19:14.670
Go that way.

01:19:16.106 --> 01:19:18.206
Can I speak to her?

01:19:18.409 --> 01:19:21.243
Please, Tessa? Please?

01:19:22.946 --> 01:19:25.681
Eva, Katie for you.

01:19:25.983 --> 01:19:29.685
Ask her. She knows.
She saw the monkey.

01:19:29.687 --> 01:19:30.052
Ask her.

01:19:30.054 --> 01:19:34.723
I already did. She said she
doesn't know anything about it.

01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:40.228
Amy: Well, we all agree that we need
to hear her version one more time.

01:19:40.230 --> 01:19:43.365
Yeah, but if she mentions
the monkey again,

01:19:43.367 --> 01:19:44.399
let's not focus on it.

01:19:44.401 --> 01:19:46.868
We've got to try to get to
the root of the problem.

01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:48.236
I see it happen all the time.

01:19:48.238 --> 01:19:49.871
The kid starts lying,

01:19:49.873 --> 01:19:51.073
does something wrong,

01:19:51.075 --> 01:19:51.873
next thing you know,

01:19:51.875 --> 01:19:55.010
the parents are calling
us to report a runaway.

01:19:55.012 --> 01:19:58.380
Honey, I don't think
it's that serious.

01:20:18.736 --> 01:20:19.968
Jack, come on.

01:20:19.970 --> 01:20:22.838
Eva doesn't want to play.

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:25.040
Eva, voice-over:
To mom, dad, and tom...

01:20:25.042 --> 01:20:29.244
Katie just told me she saw
my monkey in the park.

01:20:29.246 --> 01:20:31.446
I have to go rescue him.

01:20:31.448 --> 01:20:33.048
P.S. This is not a lie.

01:20:33.050 --> 01:20:34.983
I swear I'll never lie again,

01:20:34.985 --> 01:20:38.320
and I'll never keep a secret
from you guys again.

01:20:38.322 --> 01:20:41.189
Love you... Eva.

01:20:44.828 --> 01:20:46.862
Jack, what?

01:20:46.864 --> 01:20:49.431
What?

01:20:50.134 --> 01:20:52.768
Honey, I know
eva's not in here.

01:20:52.770 --> 01:20:54.436
I have to go look for her.

01:20:54.438 --> 01:20:57.005
Monkeys.

01:20:58.308 --> 01:21:01.476
Honey, what did you say?

01:21:05.315 --> 01:21:07.382
Tom, Peter, hurry!

01:21:07.384 --> 01:21:12.187
Jack, did you say
what I think you said?

01:21:13.357 --> 01:21:14.523
What's the matter?
What's goin' on?

01:21:14.525 --> 01:21:17.993
Amy: Shh! Shh! He's saying
his first word.

01:21:17.995 --> 01:21:20.162
Tom: Yeah? What did he say?

01:21:20.164 --> 01:21:21.863
What did he say, Amy?

01:21:21.865 --> 01:21:23.098
Come on, honey.

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:24.499
Tell me what you said.

01:21:24.501 --> 01:21:25.867
What was it?

01:21:25.869 --> 01:21:28.570
Tell mommy. Say it again.

01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:30.972
Monkeys.

01:21:30.974 --> 01:21:34.376
Don't you think he's trying
to tell us something,

01:21:34.378 --> 01:21:36.478
that a monkey was here
and that he saw it?

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:39.881
No. I'll tell you what
he's trying to tell us.

01:21:41.518 --> 01:21:43.084
Here's your monkey.

01:21:43.086 --> 01:21:44.553
Monkey.

01:21:44.555 --> 01:21:46.054
Right, Jacko?

01:21:46.056 --> 01:21:47.122
Yeah.

01:21:47.124 --> 01:21:48.590
What?

01:21:49.893 --> 01:21:53.028
We better go get eva.

01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:54.529
What is it, honey?

01:21:54.531 --> 01:21:57.465
I'm gonna go to the park, tom.

01:22:02.539 --> 01:22:04.840
Ohh!

01:22:04.842 --> 01:22:07.242
Amy: Honey! Oh, no way.

01:22:07.244 --> 01:22:09.578
Oh, my God.

01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:11.413
There's my honey.

01:22:11.415 --> 01:22:12.380
Hey.

01:22:12.382 --> 01:22:12.914
Monkey.

01:22:12.916 --> 01:22:16.885
Yes. There's a monkey right there.
You were right.

01:22:16.887 --> 01:22:19.321
Dodger!

01:22:25.162 --> 01:22:27.362
Dodger!

01:22:47.351 --> 01:22:49.050
Aah!

01:22:49.052 --> 01:22:52.287
What have you done to
my monkey, sweetheart?

01:22:52.289 --> 01:22:54.489
He's not your monkey anymore.

01:22:54.491 --> 01:22:57.425
He ran because he hates you.

01:22:57.427 --> 01:22:58.393
He came to me.

01:22:58.395 --> 01:23:02.664
He came to you just
'cause he likes kids.

01:23:02.666 --> 01:23:04.432
He belongs to my son mark,

01:23:04.434 --> 01:23:09.004
who's around here somewheres
looking like crazy for his monkey.

01:23:09.006 --> 01:23:09.671
You stealed it from him.

01:23:09.673 --> 01:23:14.476
Now, you don't want to break
this poor kid's heart, do you?

01:23:14.478 --> 01:23:16.912
You're a liar!

01:23:17.948 --> 01:23:19.447
What did you do to my monkey?

01:23:19.449 --> 01:23:22.684
You brainwashed him!
He don't steal no more!

01:23:22.686 --> 01:23:24.286
He doesn't?

01:23:24.288 --> 01:23:27.522
Damn right. Don't pretend
you ain't did it!

01:23:27.524 --> 01:23:29.524
Don't you lie to me, girl.

01:23:29.526 --> 01:23:30.625
I've quit lying!

01:23:30.627 --> 01:23:33.395
I'm glad he doesn't
steal anymore.

01:23:33.397 --> 01:23:34.562
Good goin', dodger.

01:23:34.564 --> 01:23:38.166
My monkey's name
is fingers, not dodger!

01:23:38.168 --> 01:23:39.668
I hate the damn Dodgers!

01:23:39.670 --> 01:23:42.570
And now you'll help me
find him.

01:23:42.572 --> 01:23:43.171
Never!

01:23:43.173 --> 01:23:45.340
Amy: Tom, you're not sneezing.

01:23:45.342 --> 01:23:46.675
Yeah, well, he's lived
with us so long,

01:23:46.677 --> 01:23:49.711
I must have gotten used to him.

01:24:01.258 --> 01:24:02.390
Call him.

01:24:02.392 --> 01:24:03.692
No!

01:24:04.561 --> 01:24:06.728
Tom, how could you
let him get away?

01:24:06.730 --> 01:24:10.031
I don't know. I thought
he went back to you.

01:24:10.033 --> 01:24:11.232
Let's just go look for eva,

01:24:11.234 --> 01:24:14.002
and we'll look for the
monkey on the way, ok?

01:24:14.004 --> 01:24:15.603
Dodger?

01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:18.473
Oh, dod... ooh!

01:24:18.475 --> 01:24:21.343
Somebody, help!

01:24:21.345 --> 01:24:22.510
Somebody!

01:24:22.512 --> 01:24:24.012
Mmm!

01:24:40.731 --> 01:24:42.297
What was that?

01:24:42.299 --> 01:24:44.032
Tom? He took my gun.

01:24:44.034 --> 01:24:46.101
Monkey took my gun!

01:24:50.674 --> 01:24:52.774
Careful, dodger.

01:24:52.776 --> 01:24:55.410
Careful!

01:24:56.079 --> 01:24:58.079
Eva: No! Don't!

01:24:58.749 --> 01:25:00.382
Good. Good.

01:25:00.384 --> 01:25:01.182
Good.

01:25:01.184 --> 01:25:03.551
Get away. Come on. Get away.

01:25:03.553 --> 01:25:05.053
Get away.

01:25:06.556 --> 01:25:08.089
Steady, fingers.

01:25:08.091 --> 01:25:08.456
Come on!

01:25:08.458 --> 01:25:10.725
Run! He's gonna get you. Run!

01:25:10.727 --> 01:25:12.227
I love you.

01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:13.261
Ah! He's lying.

01:25:13.263 --> 01:25:16.364
Come on. Nice little girl.

01:25:17.567 --> 01:25:18.700
Dork.

01:25:18.702 --> 01:25:20.735
What a nice little girl.

01:25:20.737 --> 01:25:22.103
She's my friend.

01:25:22.105 --> 01:25:23.638
I love her so mu...

01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:25.573
eh... Yehh!

01:25:26.376 --> 01:25:27.575
Ooh! Ooh.

01:25:32.749 --> 01:25:34.149
Eva?

01:25:34.785 --> 01:25:37.385
Mommy!

01:25:39.189 --> 01:25:41.423
Eva, you all right?

01:25:44.061 --> 01:25:46.394
Oh, sweetie, are you ok?

01:25:56.139 --> 01:25:57.305
Get in the car.

01:25:57.307 --> 01:25:58.206
Please.

01:25:58.208 --> 01:25:59.240
Get in the car!

01:25:59.242 --> 01:25:59.774
I'm a poor gypsy.

01:25:59.776 --> 01:26:03.812
"Please"? I'm gonna rip your
eyes out of you. "Please."

01:26:03.814 --> 01:26:07.415
Please don't hurt me.

01:26:07.417 --> 01:26:08.316
Ok, pal!

01:26:08.318 --> 01:26:10.351
You're under arrest.

01:26:13.623 --> 01:26:16.157
Come over here.

01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:17.392
Get out of here!

01:26:17.394 --> 01:26:19.661
I've been trying
to call you, officer.

01:26:19.663 --> 01:26:23.298
These men are killers.
They're trying to hurt me.

01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:24.399
Oh. Ahh...

01:26:24.401 --> 01:26:24.699
Mmm-wah!

01:26:24.701 --> 01:26:27.168
I got him, cates. Thank
you, your highness...

01:26:27.170 --> 01:26:29.804
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Get up!

01:26:29.806 --> 01:26:31.239
For saving my life!

01:26:31.241 --> 01:26:33.808
Put your hands
behind your back.

01:26:33.810 --> 01:26:35.176
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:26:35.178 --> 01:26:36.611
If you give up the right
to remain silent,

01:26:36.613 --> 01:26:39.481
anything you say can and
will be used against you

01:26:39.483 --> 01:26:40.248
in a court of law.

01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:41.382
You have the right
to an attorney.

01:26:41.384 --> 01:26:42.517
If you can't
afford an attorney...

01:26:42.519 --> 01:26:45.186
Oh, ho ho! Ho ho! One will be
appointed to you by the court.

01:26:45.188 --> 01:26:47.589
Understand these rights
as I've explained it...

01:26:47.591 --> 01:26:49.524
what are you laughing about?

01:26:49.526 --> 01:26:51.493
I'm not laughing! I'm crying!

01:26:51.495 --> 01:26:54.696
Hey, lieutenant,
check this out.

01:26:54.698 --> 01:26:56.331
Isn't this your wife's pin?

01:26:56.333 --> 01:26:57.532
Oh...

01:26:57.534 --> 01:27:00.802
Oh! Hoo hoo hoo ho!

01:27:00.804 --> 01:27:02.570
Ah, ha ha ha...

01:27:02.572 --> 01:27:04.439
Yes, it is.

01:27:04.441 --> 01:27:05.306
Oh!

01:27:05.308 --> 01:27:06.574
Oh! Ha ha ha! Mmm-wah!

01:27:06.576 --> 01:27:07.675
Ah! Thank you!

01:27:07.677 --> 01:27:10.545
Book him.

01:27:10.547 --> 01:27:12.180
Can I keep him?

01:27:12.182 --> 01:27:12.547
Please?!

01:27:12.549 --> 01:27:14.582
Now that you know how
responsible I can be.

01:27:14.584 --> 01:27:18.887
I took care of him so good, you
didn't even know I had him.

01:27:18.889 --> 01:27:20.455
Peter: You know,
she's got a point.

01:27:20.457 --> 01:27:22.423
Yeah, I do. I really do.

01:27:22.425 --> 01:27:24.626
Mark: Fingers!

01:27:26.730 --> 01:27:28.730
Get over here, fingers!

01:27:28.732 --> 01:27:29.797
Tom: Amy!

01:27:29.799 --> 01:27:30.398
Ha ha!

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:32.400
Oh, have I got
good news for you.

01:27:32.402 --> 01:27:32.867
What?

01:27:32.869 --> 01:27:35.904
Oh, just, uh, pick a hand.

01:27:37.274 --> 01:27:38.339
Come on.

01:27:38.341 --> 01:27:39.174
Ohh!

01:27:39.176 --> 01:27:40.308
Whoa! My ring!

01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:43.645
Oh, my God! Honey,
you found my ring!

01:27:44.814 --> 01:27:47.849
He's your real dad, isn't he?

01:27:47.851 --> 01:27:51.920
That's why you liked my hat.

01:27:51.922 --> 01:27:54.255
Honey...

01:27:55.292 --> 01:27:57.892
I love him a lot, you know.

01:27:57.894 --> 01:28:00.895
Who cares? He belongs to me.

01:28:00.897 --> 01:28:03.331
Let him choose.

01:28:43.473 --> 01:28:45.573
Sweetheart, what happened?

01:28:45.575 --> 01:28:46.908
Where's your monkey?

01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:48.743
That's dodger's real dad.

01:28:48.745 --> 01:28:49.911
We let him choose,

01:28:49.913 --> 01:28:53.314
and he decided
to go live with him.

01:28:53.316 --> 01:28:54.916
Aw, baby, I'm sorry.

01:28:54.918 --> 01:28:57.485
Can we go home now?

01:28:57.487 --> 01:28:58.920
Yeah.

01:29:15.972 --> 01:29:20.475
Sweetie... Sweetie,
listen to me.

01:29:24.547 --> 01:29:26.614
Come on, fingers.

01:29:27.651 --> 01:29:29.350
Stop that!

01:29:40.297 --> 01:29:41.729
It's ok.

01:29:47.337 --> 01:29:48.770
It's ok.

01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:54.008
You were so brave.

01:29:55.011 --> 01:29:58.646
You did the right thing.
I'm really proud of you.

01:30:24.074 --> 01:30:25.773
Dodger!

01:31:12.722 --> 01:31:13.921
Eva: Come on.

01:31:13.923 --> 01:31:15.690
It's just my classroom.

01:31:15.692 --> 01:31:16.824
What's the matter?

01:31:16.826 --> 01:31:19.961
Come on. Don't be afraid.

01:31:19.963 --> 01:31:21.462
This is our big day.

01:31:21.464 --> 01:31:22.730
Come on.

01:31:35.812 --> 01:31:36.844
Monkeys.

01:31:36.846 --> 01:31:37.845
Yeah!

01:31:37.847 --> 01:31:39.113
All gone?

01:31:39.115 --> 01:31:41.149
Oh...

01:31:42.619 --> 01:31:44.619
That's right. He was all gone.

01:31:44.621 --> 01:31:47.155
But you found him, didn't you?

01:31:54.531 --> 01:31:57.098
I love you, Jack.

01:32:00.503 --> 01:32:01.936
Dodger, get down here.

01:32:01.938 --> 01:32:06.541
Why don't you say hello
to everyone first?

01:32:10.647 --> 01:32:12.880
I'm ready for my show and tell.

01:32:12.882 --> 01:32:13.681
Ok.

01:32:13.683 --> 01:32:16.684
Ok, you guys ready?
