focused from the start--

01:33.955 --> 01:35.164
Chef, the pasta's wrong.

01:35.267 --> 01:36.061
I'm sorry?

01:36.165 --> 01:37.097

Left or right?

01:46.554 --> 01:47.176

Got it.

01:48.660 --> 01:51.145
NARRATOR: Nick quickly foundhis rhythm leading the kitchen.

01:51.249 --> 01:52.905
Love the idea, butlet's get cream leeks off.

Thank you for

01:59.671 --> 02:02.294
No pork on this
Beef Wellington.

We can't do the
Wellington with no pork.

02:03.985 --> 02:04.848
Oh, fuck.

down the momentum.

02:07.265 --> 02:08.783

02:08.887 --> 02:09.922
I need it right now.

02:10.026 --> 02:11.269
When they're slow,
you need to tell them,

02:11.372 --> 02:12.580
"Change fucking gear."

02:12.684 --> 02:15.307
NARRATOR: So when it cametime to pick his finalists--

03:06.013 --> 03:07.359
Good job.

03:07.463 --> 03:09.603
MICHELLE TRIBBLE: In Season 14,I didn't make it in the finale.

03:09.706 --> 03:10.742
I was so close.

03:10.845 --> 03:13.020
You came very, very close.

03:13.123 --> 03:14.987
Your jacket please, [inaudible].

03:15.091 --> 03:17.783
It was too tough of acall, even for Chef Ramsay.

03:17.887 --> 03:20.303

03:20.407 --> 03:22.616

03:29.243 --> 03:30.520

03:30.624 --> 03:32.833
BENJAMIN KNACK: Now, sous-videis a cutting-edge technique.

03:32.936 --> 03:37.424
It's slow temp cooking, and it'smaybe a $3,000, $4,000 machine.

03:37.527 --> 03:38.804
MICHELLE TRIBBLE: I
can't even comprehend

03:38.908 --> 03:39.978

05:15.073 --> 05:18.421
three exceptional entrees.

05:18.525 --> 05:21.459
So tonight, these souschefs will be assisting you.

05:21.562 --> 05:25.014
But obviously, there are threetalented all stars remaining,

05:25.117 --> 05:26.636
and only two of them.

05:26.740 --> 05:30.088
So I reached out to atrusted colleague of mine.

05:30.191 --> 05:31.986
Her name is [inaudible],,

05:32.090 --> 05:34.230
that's been working withme for the last five years.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.922
Christina, Jocky, and
[inaudible],, please.

05:37.026 --> 05:39.200
[tense music playing]

05:41.582 --> 05:43.929
I have in my hands
three envelopes.

05:44.033 --> 05:47.070
Michelle, come grab one.

05:47.174 --> 05:49.556
Nick.

05:49.659 --> 05:50.419
Benjamin.

05:54.388 --> 05:55.631
Michelle, unveil.

05:55.734 --> 05:57.702
Who've you got as
your sous chef?

05:57.805 --> 05:58.910
Chef Jocky.

05:59.013 --> 05:59.842
GORDON RAMSAY: Chef Jocky.

05:59.945 --> 06:01.222
Nick, who've you got?

06:01.326 --> 06:02.292
Chef Christina.

06:02.396 --> 06:03.742
Christina's super
inspiring, going

06:03.846 --> 06:05.468
from winning Hell's
Kitchen to running,

06:05.572 --> 06:07.712
essentially, a Vegas
empire of restaurants.

06:07.815 --> 06:09.472
And I'm excited to beworking with her, because I

06:09.576 --> 06:10.922
know she's going to kill it.

06:11.025 --> 06:11.992
GORDON RAMSAY: That means--

06:12.095 --> 06:16.928
Benjamin, you have
Chef [inaudible] Great.

06:17.031 --> 06:19.344
I think that every sous
chef wants us to win.

06:19.448 --> 06:21.139
Even though I haven't mether, or I don't know her,

06:21.242 --> 06:22.865
I'm sure Chef Ramsay
would not pick

06:22.968 --> 06:24.453
Chef [inaudible] if
he didn't think she

06:24.556 --> 06:25.764
wanted to come here and win.

06:25.868 --> 06:28.318
Head up to the
dorms and get to work.

06:28.422 --> 06:29.975
Your sous chefs will
join you shortly.

06:30.079 --> 06:30.873
Off you go.

06:30.976 --> 06:32.737
Yes, chef.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.428
- I'm happy I--- We have to go clean the dorms.

06:34.532 --> 06:35.843
[laughter]

06:35.947 --> 06:36.775
They're like, eww.
[laughter]

06:36.879 --> 06:37.949
[upbeat music playing]

06:38.052 --> 06:40.089
We cannot have disgustingdorms when the sous

06:40.192 --> 06:41.366
chefs are coming in here.

06:41.470 --> 06:43.368
They're going to think
we're, like, ratchet.

06:43.472 --> 06:44.576
Why do we have
an ashtray in here?

06:44.680 --> 06:46.509
Because we're disgusting.

06:46.613 --> 06:47.407
[spraying noise]

06:47.510 --> 06:50.168
There you go.

06:50.271 --> 06:51.307
BENJAMIN KNACK: We're peasants.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.446
I was having tater
tots for dinner.

06:55.380 --> 06:56.208
[knocking]

06:57.209 --> 06:58.072
MICHELLE TRIBBLE: Come in!

06:58.176 --> 06:59.557
Hello, chefs.
- Oh, hey.

06:59.660 --> 07:00.523
Hey.

07:00.627 --> 07:02.111
Oh, you could've
cleaned up, no?

07:02.214 --> 07:03.181
This is cleaned up.

07:03.284 --> 07:05.908
Oh my god.

07:06.011 --> 07:07.288
We can sit on
the couches, chef.

07:07.392 --> 07:10.119
I'm paired with Chef
Jocky, and I love it.

07:10.222 --> 07:11.741
Everything here
is Asian-inspired.

07:11.845 --> 07:13.053
OK.

07:13.156 --> 07:15.538
He runs a three Michelinstar restaurant in London.

07:15.642 --> 07:18.368
And to have a chef
of this caliber

07:18.472 --> 07:22.372
elevate my dishes is areward in itself, honestly.

07:22.476 --> 07:25.341
The fish dish is going tobe sea bass with squid ink

07:25.445 --> 07:27.792
pasta, and calamari--

07:27.895 --> 07:29.000
I don't know.

07:29.103 --> 07:30.311
Do you think it sounds weird?

07:30.415 --> 07:31.381
You won't be tasting anything.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.591
It's just too much
of a good thing.

07:33.694 --> 07:35.662
I don't think we need thecalamari or anything else.

07:35.765 --> 07:37.180
I think just the pasta.

07:37.284 --> 07:38.285
That's why I'm here-- to help.

07:38.388 --> 07:40.563
Yeah.

07:40.667 --> 07:43.428
I do kind of classic,simple French, in general.

07:43.532 --> 07:47.018
I love the traditional truffles,blue cheese, Brussel sprouts--

07:47.121 --> 07:48.329
like, that kind of old school--

07:48.433 --> 07:49.296
Yeah.

07:49.399 --> 07:51.229
--French style,
but with this new--

07:51.332 --> 07:53.300
everybody kind of
likes the smoke meats.

07:53.403 --> 07:55.475
This is definitely my
"Paris, Texas" menu--

07:55.578 --> 07:58.201
Paris, France for
technique, and Texas

07:58.305 --> 07:59.686
for the big, bold flavors.

07:59.789 --> 08:01.722
Having Brussel sprouts kindof fall around the side--

08:01.826 --> 08:03.034
Hmm.

08:03.137 --> 08:04.069
--with a blue cheese butter,and the shaped shallots,

08:04.173 --> 08:05.450
and then sauce on the backside.

08:08.211 --> 08:09.074
So the fish--

08:09.178 --> 08:10.731
I wanted to kind
of keep it simple.

08:10.835 --> 08:13.700
I wanted to do halibut,and then use carrot juice

08:13.803 --> 08:16.012
as a base for a beurre blanc.

08:16.116 --> 08:17.324
I think it's different.

08:17.427 --> 08:18.532
Yeah, definitely.

08:18.636 --> 08:20.292
I mean, this whole dishis a little bit different.

08:20.396 --> 08:21.673
NICK PETERS: My menu
was really personal.

08:21.777 --> 08:25.125
I think that might set me apartfrom Michelle and Benjamin.

08:25.228 --> 08:27.023
This, to me, is like,
so Nick on a plate.

08:27.127 --> 08:28.162
I'm really excited.

08:28.266 --> 08:29.336
I think it's going to
be, really, a pretty

08:29.439 --> 08:30.510
epic battle in Hell's Kitchen.

08:30.613 --> 08:31.821
Good night, guys.
Get some sleep.

08:31.925 --> 08:32.891
BENJAMIN KNACK: Thank you, chef.

08:32.995 --> 08:34.755
Good night, chef.

08:34.859 --> 08:36.067
Are we eating
tater tots, still?

08:36.170 --> 08:37.551
Yes.
I'm starving.

08:37.655 --> 08:38.448
Sounds really good, now.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.002
I'm actually pretty hungry.

08:40.105 --> 08:41.141
Wine and tater tots?

08:41.244 --> 08:43.074
Mmm.

08:43.177 --> 08:45.007
Walking tots.

08:45.110 --> 08:46.215
Guys, can I walk my tots?

08:46.318 --> 08:46.940
MICHELLE TRIBBLE: --goingto bring my fucking--

08:47.043 --> 08:47.975
walk the tots.

08:48.079 --> 08:49.080
Walk the tot.
NICK PETERS: Thank you.

08:49.183 --> 08:50.012
Garnish is in the window.

08:50.115 --> 08:50.909
Walk.

08:51.013 --> 08:52.117
Walking tots.

08:52.221 --> 08:53.015
He tots.

08:58.917 --> 09:00.194
NARRATOR: This

09:00.298 --> 09:01.368
will hit the ground running--

09:01.471 --> 09:02.472
Let's go, guys.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.060
Grab your sous chefs
and get in your kitchen.

09:04.164 --> 09:06.891
NARRATOR: --as they have justone hour to prepare a tasting

09:06.994 --> 09:08.271
menu for Chef Ramsay--

09:08.375 --> 09:09.859
Everything prepared
and ready to go, right?

09:09.963 --> 09:11.309
Yes, chef.

09:11.412 --> 09:13.898
NARRATOR: --which will includedishes from their final menu.

09:14.001 --> 09:15.658
So you're feeling excitedabout this challenge, eh?

09:15.762 --> 09:17.073
Yes.
I'm very excited.

09:17.177 --> 09:19.766
This is Chef Jocky and I'sfirst time working together.

09:19.869 --> 09:20.663
Yes, chef.

09:20.767 --> 09:22.423
Call me Jocky.

09:22.527 --> 09:23.493
Oh.

09:23.597 --> 09:25.599
It's hard to read
Chef Jocky sometimes.

09:25.703 --> 09:27.428
Is that your first
name or your last name?

09:27.532 --> 09:29.258
It's not my name at all.

09:29.361 --> 09:30.328
Your name is Tom?

09:30.431 --> 09:33.158
That's not my
name at all At all.

09:33.262 --> 09:34.781
It's not your name at all?

09:34.884 --> 09:35.816
It's your nickname, chef?

09:35.920 --> 09:37.128
Yeah.

09:37.231 --> 09:39.268
You don't know if he'sbeing, like, funny, or serious,

09:39.371 --> 09:40.476
or sarcastic.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.064
We get into random small talk--

09:42.167 --> 09:44.687
You should do a trip to
Japan sometime then, no?

09:44.791 --> 09:45.964
I would love to.

09:46.068 --> 09:48.518
But at the same time, Ireally enjoy working with him.

09:48.622 --> 09:49.519
Nice, chef.

09:49.623 --> 09:50.486
What's that?

09:50.590 --> 09:53.662
I said, very nice.

09:53.765 --> 09:55.008
I'll just cut
out blocks for you,

09:55.111 --> 09:56.665
and you tell me what you'relooking for from this line.

09:56.768 --> 09:57.804
OK.
Yes.

09:57.907 --> 09:59.253
I don't like thin
slices, really.

09:59.357 --> 10:00.392
I'm not a fan of that.
- OK.

10:00.496 --> 10:01.290
Copy.

10:01.393 --> 10:02.187
That's good.

10:02.291 --> 10:03.154
Yeah.

10:03.257 --> 10:04.120
Just no sear.

10:04.224 --> 10:05.812
No sear.

10:05.915 --> 10:06.709
[inaudible]: Good?

10:06.813 --> 10:08.366
That's awesome.

10:08.469 --> 10:10.920
We cut through the tuna
and it tasted amazing.

10:11.024 --> 10:11.887
Yeah.

10:11.990 --> 10:13.267
Let's go with--
I'll go with this.

10:13.371 --> 10:14.372
I want to change my dish.

10:14.475 --> 10:15.649
Originally, I was
going to sear it.

10:15.753 --> 10:18.203
But now, I'm just going tobe slicing little squares

10:18.307 --> 10:19.342
and then finishing them off.

10:19.446 --> 10:21.413
We'll do a little
circle of bowls.

10:21.517 --> 10:22.483
And we'll do 1, 2, 3.

10:22.587 --> 10:24.002
Sometimes, when a
chef's doing something,

10:24.106 --> 10:26.315
they might have better
ideas than before.

10:26.418 --> 10:28.800
It's really important to makeadjustments, or be, you know,

10:28.904 --> 10:29.836
quick on your feet.

10:29.939 --> 10:31.561
That's what a great chef does.

10:31.665 --> 10:33.080
You're going to be OK
with your beurre blanc

10:33.184 --> 10:34.116
and your hollandaise?

10:34.219 --> 10:35.013
Yes, chef.

10:35.117 --> 10:36.187
OK.

10:36.290 --> 10:38.085
I think my sauces are
a little more riskier.

10:38.189 --> 10:39.569
Like, I am doing a hollandaise.

10:39.673 --> 10:40.709
I'm doing a beurre blanc.

10:40.812 --> 10:42.469
I'm just trying to be
a little bit different.

10:42.572 --> 10:43.366
My chicken's in.

10:43.470 --> 10:44.540
Is a timer on it?

10:44.644 --> 10:46.162
I have my halibut and
my venison both started.

10:46.266 --> 10:49.131
I don't want to miss this secondchance-- a second opportunity

10:49.234 --> 10:51.616
to be the winner
of Hell's Kitchen.

10:51.720 --> 10:54.826
That's that chicken.

10:54.930 --> 10:56.414
Ben, were mine on the
top or the bottom?

10:56.517 --> 10:57.898
You're on top, sir.

10:58.002 --> 10:58.934
That's a first.

10:59.037 --> 11:00.142
[laughter]

11:00.245 --> 11:01.212
10 minutes to go.

11:01.315 --> 11:02.558
Yes, chef.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.801
And we're going
to start plating.

11:03.904 --> 11:05.423
You know, last time I didn'tmake it to the finals.

11:05.526 --> 11:06.527
And this time, I did.

11:06.631 --> 11:07.736
I think someone's
going to go home today.

11:07.839 --> 11:10.255
But I don't plan on
going home today.

11:11.256 --> 11:12.292
We've got to plate.

11:12.395 --> 11:13.742
Yes, we do.GORDON RAMSAY: Let's go, guys.

11:13.845 --> 11:14.674

11:14.777 --> 11:15.502

11:15.605 --> 11:16.192

- Ben?

11:17.504 --> 11:18.367
BENJAMIN KNACK: Yes, chef.

11:18.470 --> 11:19.540
Last couple of
minutes, Michelle.

11:19.644 --> 11:20.472
MICHELLE TRIBBLE: Yes, chef.

11:23.924 --> 11:25.098
Oh my god.

11:25.201 --> 11:28.411
My beurre blanc starts breakingbecause it got too hot.

11:28.515 --> 11:29.481
My brain's racing.

11:29.585 --> 11:30.862
Like, what am I going to do?

11:30.966 --> 11:32.622
It's kind of crucial becauseit's a huge part of the dish.

11:32.726 --> 11:33.693
What else do we have to do?

11:33.796 --> 11:35.867
I basically need to
fix my beurre blanc.

11:35.971 --> 11:36.972
It just broke.

11:37.075 --> 11:39.112
Giving me a fucking
heart attack.

11:39.215 --> 11:41.355
30 seconds to go.

11:41.459 --> 11:42.253
Fuck.

11:42.356 --> 11:44.738
[sizzling]

11:46.878 --> 11:48.777
[thrilling music playing]

11:48.880 --> 11:50.744
NARRATOR: The finalthree chefs are preparing

11:52.159 --> 11:53.367

We've got to plate.

11:53.471 --> 11:54.437
Yes, we do.

11:54.541 --> 11:56.094
NARRATOR: And with
only moments left--

11:56.198 --> 11:57.406
Oh my god.

11:57.509 --> 11:59.857
NARRATOR: --Nick has discoveredhe has a bit of a crisis

11:59.960 --> 12:00.961
with his beurre blanc.

12:01.065 --> 12:02.031
What else do we have to do?

12:02.135 --> 12:04.275
I basically need to
fix my beurre blanc.

12:04.378 --> 12:05.586
It just broke.

12:05.690 --> 12:07.657
Giving me a fucking
heart attack.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.763
Now, I start basically
a whole new base

12:09.867 --> 12:12.179
to create a whole newbeurre blanc, essentially.

12:12.283 --> 12:13.525
I am just praying.

12:13.629 --> 12:14.664
It's good.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.943
Uh, next is the fish.

12:17.046 --> 12:17.978
Excuse me, chef.

12:18.082 --> 12:19.186
30 seconds.

Who'd like to go first?

12:38.171 --> 12:39.551
[laughter]
- Michelle.

12:39.655 --> 12:40.967
Let's go.

12:41.070 --> 12:42.865
MICHELLE TRIBBLE: I want to showChef Ramsay what I'm made of.

12:42.969 --> 12:45.040
You know, really blow
him away with the dishes

12:45.143 --> 12:46.835
that I can create--
refined dishes

12:46.938 --> 12:48.698
that do a lot oftechnique, a lot of skill,

12:48.802 --> 12:50.217
and a lot of flavor.

12:50.321 --> 12:51.736
GORDON RAMSAY: Visually,
they look delicious.

12:51.840 --> 12:52.875
Let's start off
with the cold app.

12:52.979 --> 12:54.083
Describe it, please.

12:54.187 --> 12:55.602
MICHELLE TRIBBLE: The coldapp is a hamachi crudo

12:55.705 --> 12:56.810
that's been quick-cured.

12:56.914 --> 12:57.915
There's a cucumber coulis.

13:01.539 --> 13:04.024
I love the fragrance
of the citrus.

13:04.128 --> 13:06.544
Really good, indeed.

13:06.647 --> 13:08.063
BENJAMIN KNACK: Michelle
is tough competition.

13:08.166 --> 13:09.512
She is very talented.

13:09.616 --> 13:10.997
She's very intelligent.

13:11.100 --> 13:14.207
The next course,
chef, is uni risotto.

13:14.310 --> 13:15.139
Delicious.

13:15.242 --> 13:16.381
Really good [inaudible].

13:16.485 --> 13:18.107
BENJAMIN KNACK: She livesand breathes cooking.

13:18.211 --> 13:19.626
That's apparent
in her challenges

13:19.729 --> 13:20.903
as well as her service.

13:21.007 --> 13:22.146
GORDON RAMSAY: Sea bass?

13:22.249 --> 13:23.733
MICHELLE TRIBBLE: Underneathis a squid ink pasta.

13:23.837 --> 13:24.804
GORDON RAMSAY: Delicious.

13:24.907 --> 13:26.081
You want the strongest
competitors there.

13:26.184 --> 13:27.599
And I think you have
them, right now.

13:27.703 --> 13:28.877
Anybody could win this.

13:28.980 --> 13:29.774
And this one?

13:29.878 --> 13:33.985
I have a crispy chicken thigh.

13:34.089 --> 13:36.401
That's really good.

13:36.505 --> 13:38.162
I love to see you
using the cheap cuts,

13:38.265 --> 13:41.096
elevating it into
something magical.

13:41.199 --> 13:42.200
MICHELLE TRIBBLE:
The last course

13:42.304 --> 13:45.376
is a miso New York strip.

13:45.479 --> 13:47.205
New York strip-- delicious.

13:47.309 --> 13:48.655
It's a very strong effort.

13:48.758 --> 13:50.036
They ooze personality.

13:50.139 --> 13:51.969
Benjamin and Nick, you guyshave your work cut out for you,

13:52.072 --> 13:53.073
let me tell you.
- Yes, chef.

13:53.177 --> 13:54.074
Thank you, chef.

13:54.178 --> 13:56.007
I am so versatile,
and I just wanted

13:56.111 --> 13:57.181
to show Chef Ramsay that.

13:57.284 --> 13:59.010
And I feel like
I made him proud.

13:59.114 --> 14:01.323
And I'm really glad thathe liked all of my dishes.

14:01.426 --> 14:02.358
Right.Benjamin, let's go, please.

14:02.462 --> 14:03.497
BENJAMIN KNACK: Yes, chef.

14:03.601 --> 14:05.672
I think I am the best
chef in Hell's Kitchen,

14:05.775 --> 14:07.985
and I'm going to prove
that to Chef Ramsay.

14:08.088 --> 14:10.953
We have ahi tuna here withponzu, chili oil, then caviar.

14:11.057 --> 14:11.851
GORDON RAMSAY: Wow.

14:11.954 --> 14:12.921
That's amazing.

It's a lovely, refreshingcold appetizer.

14:14.819 --> 14:16.027
Thank you, chef
GORDON RAMSAY: Next one?

14:16.131 --> 14:17.649
What we have here iswe have shrimp and grits.

14:17.753 --> 14:19.513
Finish with a good amount ofParmesan at the end, chef.

14:19.617 --> 14:20.652
GORDON RAMSAY:
Really good, indeed.

14:20.756 --> 14:22.206
Those shrimp are
cooked beautifully.

14:22.309 --> 14:24.449
But you've elevated shrimp andgrits to the Premier League.

14:24.553 --> 14:25.347
Let's get that right.

14:25.450 --> 14:26.451
So show off [inaudible]

14:26.555 --> 14:27.349
Yes, chef.

14:29.592 --> 14:31.732
Chef Ramsay really
liked Michelle's dishes,

14:31.836 --> 14:33.769
and Benjamin's dishes
are near perfect.

14:33.873 --> 14:34.977
GORDON RAMSAY: Vibrant.

14:35.081 --> 14:36.254
Wonderful-- especiallythe garnish with the peas,

14:36.358 --> 14:37.911
and the fennel and potatoes.
- Thank you, chef.

14:38.015 --> 14:40.155
I'm kind of freaking
out a little bit.

14:40.258 --> 14:41.535
GORDON RAMSAY:
Describe it, please.

14:41.639 --> 14:43.261
BENJAMIN KNACK: Chicken-- wehave an airline breast, here.

14:43.365 --> 14:44.987
Underneath, you have
chili corn puree.

14:45.091 --> 14:46.678
GORDON RAMSAY: [inaudible]what are the [inaudible]

14:46.782 --> 14:47.576
with a knife.

14:47.679 --> 14:48.922
I mean, it looks spectacular.

14:49.026 --> 14:49.889
Thank you, chef.

14:49.992 --> 14:51.166
Finally?

14:51.269 --> 14:53.340
So you have a quick brownsugar-cured filet mignon,

14:53.444 --> 14:54.721
and it's served over
truffle potatoes--

14:54.824 --> 14:56.481
Truffle, truffle, truffle.

14:56.585 --> 14:57.620
--and then a red
wine demi, chef.

14:57.724 --> 14:58.725
GORDON RAMSAY: Delicious.

14:58.828 --> 15:00.313
I love what you've
done with the marinade.

15:00.416 --> 15:01.245
Wow.

15:01.348 --> 15:02.142
I have to say--

15:02.246 --> 15:03.419
it screams decadence.

15:03.523 --> 15:05.007
It screams, "Vegas."

15:05.111 --> 15:06.215
It's near perfect.

15:06.319 --> 15:07.285
- Thank you, chef.
- Thank you.

15:08.321 --> 15:09.770
Thank you.
- Right.

15:09.874 --> 15:10.771
Nick, let's go, please.

15:10.875 --> 15:12.014
Yes, chef.

15:12.118 --> 15:14.983
I've been thinking aboutthis moment since season 14.

15:15.086 --> 15:16.225
OK.

15:16.329 --> 15:18.055
NICK PETERS: I never gotthe chance to show my menu.

15:18.158 --> 15:20.333
If there was more time, I wouldhave perfected my beurre blanc.

15:20.436 --> 15:21.679
So I'm a little nervous.

15:21.782 --> 15:23.370
Incredible balance of colors.

15:23.474 --> 15:24.406
It's like a rainbow.

15:24.509 --> 15:25.303
Nick, let's start off.

15:25.407 --> 15:26.477
Yes, chef.

15:26.580 --> 15:29.169
So my first dish is a
beef and beet carpaccio.

15:33.380 --> 15:34.209
Great start.

15:34.312 --> 15:35.417
Really good, indeed.

15:35.520 --> 15:37.212
I love the lightness
of the beef.

15:37.315 --> 15:38.109
Thank you, chef.

15:38.213 --> 15:39.214
GORDON RAMSAY: Next one?

15:39.317 --> 15:41.561
So what you have is
a cranberry hollandaise

15:41.664 --> 15:42.665
with seared bay scallops.

15:45.530 --> 15:47.049
I have to say-- thehit on that note, for me,

15:47.153 --> 15:48.637
is that cranberry hollandaise.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.397
Only you would think of
cranberry hollandaise.

15:50.501 --> 15:51.398
Thank you, chef.
GORDON RAMSAY: Love it.

15:51.502 --> 15:52.572
Next?

15:52.675 --> 15:55.644
This is tricolor baby
carrots, seared halibut

15:55.747 --> 15:58.578
with fennel pollen, and thenthe vanilla bean carrot beurre

15:58.681 --> 15:59.475
blanc.

15:59.579 --> 16:00.718
Mmm.

16:00.821 --> 16:03.031
That beurre blanc-- that'sthe star of the night.

16:03.134 --> 16:04.135
Have you tasted that?
- Yes, chef.

16:04.239 --> 16:05.067
Ha.

16:05.171 --> 16:06.103
Yes.

16:06.206 --> 16:07.725
Send that recipe
straight to Vegas.

16:07.828 --> 16:09.002
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

16:09.106 --> 16:11.487
I can't believe that Iheard Chef Ramsay say that.

16:11.591 --> 16:13.869
My mind is absolutely blown.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.491
The next course you'll
have is crispy chicken,

16:15.595 --> 16:17.597
sweet potato puree,
pickled shallots,

16:17.700 --> 16:19.116
and raw Granny Smith apples.

16:19.219 --> 16:20.738
During the fall is
when I got married,

16:20.841 --> 16:22.671
and these are all
sort of fall flavors.

16:22.774 --> 16:24.328
It's fricking delicious.Have you tasted it?

16:24.431 --> 16:25.260
Yes, chef.

16:25.363 --> 16:26.157
Love it.

16:26.261 --> 16:27.469
Boards are for rustic charm.

16:27.572 --> 16:28.677
OK.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.437
Put that onto a differentplate and you've got

16:30.541 --> 16:31.611
a show-stopping dish there.

16:31.714 --> 16:32.508
Thank you, chef.

16:32.612 --> 16:33.958
And finally?

16:34.062 --> 16:38.756
Finally, you have an espressoand chili-dusted venison loin.

16:38.859 --> 16:40.378
GORDON RAMSAY: There's
such finesse on that.

16:40.482 --> 16:42.518
And the rub is just--
yeah, mind-blowing.

16:42.622 --> 16:43.830
MICHELLE TRIBBLE:
We're all breaking it.

16:43.933 --> 16:45.211
We're all doing a great job.

16:45.314 --> 16:47.109
No one has brought
up a bad course.

16:47.213 --> 16:49.249
This competition is so close.

16:49.353 --> 16:50.354
- Brilliant.
- Thank you, chef.

16:50.457 --> 16:51.631
Really good, indeed.
Thank you, Nick.

16:51.734 --> 16:52.528
Wow.

16:52.632 --> 16:53.633
Thank you, chef.

16:53.736 --> 16:55.083
Wow.

16:55.186 --> 16:57.913
Bloody hell.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.950
Can you guys just wait
there a second, please?

17:01.054 --> 17:02.918
Yeah, I need two minutes.

17:03.022 --> 17:03.815
Yes, chef.

17:03.919 --> 17:05.231
Damn.

17:05.334 --> 17:06.370
This is so hard.

17:06.473 --> 17:07.267
What is happening?

17:07.371 --> 17:09.200
What do you think?

17:09.304 --> 17:10.270
Sous chefs.

17:10.374 --> 17:11.409
Can I borrow you for
one minute, please?

17:11.513 --> 17:12.341
Yes, chef.

17:12.445 --> 17:13.825
GORDON RAMSAY: Thank you.

17:13.929 --> 17:15.413
There can't be three
of us in the finale.

17:15.517 --> 17:16.794
There can only be two of us.

17:16.897 --> 17:18.382
So someone's going to go home.

17:18.485 --> 17:20.591
I deserve to be in thefinal two of Hell's Kitchen.

17:20.694 --> 17:22.731
[inaudible]

17:22.834 --> 17:23.628
I feel good.

17:23.732 --> 17:24.905
I feel like I belong here.

17:25.009 --> 17:25.941
GORDON RAMSAY: This is hard.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.391
I don't know where to go.

17:27.494 --> 17:29.393
Do you see him?

17:29.496 --> 17:31.567
In this very moment, I'mdefinitely feeling more anxious

17:31.671 --> 17:32.844
than I have been
in this competition

17:32.948 --> 17:34.294
because so much is on the line.

17:37.263 --> 17:40.197
Oh, here they come.

17:40.300 --> 17:41.129
[sigh]

17:44.132 --> 17:45.340
OK.

17:45.443 --> 17:49.309
Michelle, Nick, Benjamin--great job, all three of you.

17:49.413 --> 17:52.692
This is a very difficultdecision, but I've made it.

17:52.795 --> 17:58.974
The first person headinginto the grand finale is--

17:59.078 --> 18:00.424
[whoosh]

18:02.046 --> 18:03.944
[intense music playing]

18:04.048 --> 18:06.844
NARRATOR: In today's showdownbetween the final three chefs--

18:06.947 --> 18:09.640
I know I have the rightthree still in the competition.

18:09.743 --> 18:11.366
NARRATOR: --Chef
Ramsay has just tasted

18:11.469 --> 18:13.954
five dishes from
Michelle, Benjamin,

18:14.058 --> 18:16.198
and Nick's finale menus.

18:16.302 --> 18:18.890
This is a very difficultdecision, but I've made it.

18:18.994 --> 18:20.513
NARRATOR: And he
is ready to reveal

18:20.616 --> 18:23.792

What?

18:36.667 --> 18:38.876
Yes!

18:38.979 --> 18:41.465
We've never been so
deadlocked like that.

18:41.568 --> 18:42.431
Let me tell you--

18:42.535 --> 18:44.364
a moment ago, I
went up to my office

18:44.468 --> 18:45.986
and made a very important call.

18:46.090 --> 18:48.196
I had to change
some arrangements.

18:48.299 --> 18:51.716
I'm sending you all to
an incredible retreat

18:51.820 --> 18:54.305
in the middle of the
Malibu wine country.

18:54.409 --> 18:55.513
Oh.

18:55.617 --> 18:58.102

19:28.615 --> 19:29.582
Super proud.

19:29.685 --> 19:31.066
I've never been to
an award show before.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.723
It's going to be amazing
to be able to let

19:32.826 --> 19:36.416
my hair down, and just relax,and just have a good time.

19:36.520 --> 19:37.314

Look, guys.

19:54.538 --> 19:56.160
MICHELLE TRIBBLE:
We're at the ranch.

19:56.264 --> 19:57.713
As we pull into
Calamigos Ranch--

19:57.817 --> 19:59.232
it's absolutely beautiful--

19:59.336 --> 20:01.855
I have no idea what to expect.

20:01.959 --> 20:04.168
Welcome to the CCA
awards here at Calamigos

20:04.272 --> 20:05.514

20:09.484 --> 20:11.210
So let's get the party started!

20:11.313 --> 20:13.660
Excellent.

20:13.764 --> 20:14.972
BENJAMIN KNACK: Now,
look at this place.

20:15.075 --> 20:16.007
NICK PETERS: This is amazing.

20:16.111 --> 20:16.939
MICHELLE TRIBBLE: Is this us?

20:17.043 --> 20:17.837
HOSTESS: This is you.

20:17.940 --> 20:19.183

20:21.358 --> 20:22.393
HOSTESS: Have fun.
- Thank you.

20:22.497 --> 20:23.601
Bye!

20:23.705 --> 20:24.706
I don't know
that Benjamin gets

20:24.809 --> 20:26.017
his makeup done very often--

20:26.121 --> 20:27.640
I kind of like it.
It looks cool.

20:27.743 --> 20:28.675
Yeah.

20:28.779 --> 20:30.332
--but he's really
enjoying himself.

20:30.436 --> 20:31.402
Oh.

20:31.506 --> 20:32.334
I like dressing up.

20:32.438 --> 20:33.301
[inaudible]?

20:33.404 --> 20:34.543
[laughter]

20:34.647 --> 20:35.786
You're just fancy all the way.

20:35.889 --> 20:37.166
Just go for it.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.134
Benjamin's sort of like thishidden diva of the season.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.342
Yeah.

20:40.446 --> 20:42.137
Usually, I get two massagesevery single month.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.276
He likes to be pampered.

20:43.380 --> 20:44.312
And more power to you.

20:44.415 --> 20:45.209
Mm-hmm.

20:45.313 --> 20:46.106
Good job.

20:46.210 --> 20:47.107
[laughter]

20:47.211 --> 20:48.005
Why, thank you.

20:50.904 --> 20:52.285
Oh my god.

20:52.389 --> 20:54.011
This is high stress for me.

20:54.114 --> 20:56.531
I'd honestly rather be
cooking in a kitchen

20:56.634 --> 20:58.084
than trying on dresses.

20:58.187 --> 21:00.604
But Chef Ramsay wants usto have our absolute best.

21:00.707 --> 21:03.158
So, you know, I'll try to beas comfortable in all this

21:03.262 --> 21:04.055
as I can.

21:04.159 --> 21:05.091
Perfect.

21:05.194 --> 21:06.472
[vocalizing]
[laughter]

21:06.575 --> 21:07.611
No.

21:07.714 --> 21:09.544
I like the skull one
That's kind of cool.

21:09.647 --> 21:11.304
Benjamin is
looking very dapper.

21:11.408 --> 21:13.272
Michelle is adorable, as always.

21:13.375 --> 21:14.963
And there's no cooking
involved tonight.

21:15.066 --> 21:17.034
That's the best part aboutwearing a suit-- is that we

21:17.137 --> 21:18.207
can relax and enjoy ourselves.

21:18.311 --> 21:19.105
Please.

21:19.208 --> 21:20.727
Thank you, sir.

21:20.831 --> 21:22.626
You clean up nice, huh?

21:22.729 --> 21:25.111
[electronic music playing]

21:27.700 --> 21:28.597
GORDON RAMSAY: Wow.

21:28.701 --> 21:29.909
Now, there's my chefs.
Gorgeous.

21:30.012 --> 21:30.841
[inaudible], right?

21:30.944 --> 21:32.083
- How are you?
- I'm good.

21:32.187 --> 21:32.981
How are you, chef?

21:33.084 --> 21:34.051
Give me a kiss.

21:34.154 --> 21:35.224
You look amazing.

21:35.328 --> 21:36.398

21:37.951 --> 21:38.780
You look great, as well.You good?

21:38.883 --> 21:39.712
Thank you, chef.
Yes, I'm great.

21:39.815 --> 21:40.713
Let's go inside.

21:40.816 --> 21:41.955
Let's get a drink
in the reception.

21:42.059 --> 21:43.578
NICK PETERS: I've definitelygrown since season 14.

21:43.681 --> 21:45.062
The All Star competition
has definitely

21:45.165 --> 21:46.374
made me a lot
stronger as a chef,

21:46.477 --> 21:48.548
but I think also as a person.

[laughter]

22:00.491 --> 22:01.906
I never thought I'd be
walking the red carpet

22:02.010 --> 22:03.011
with Chef Ramsay.

22:03.114 --> 22:04.875
I just came here to compete.

22:04.978 --> 22:06.290
Benjamin.

22:22.271 --> 22:24.135

23:31.064 --> 23:31.927
There we go.

23:32.031 --> 23:34.792
Something weird's
about to happen.

23:34.896 --> 23:37.036
First of all, I've got aconfession to make to all three

23:37.139 --> 23:37.933
of you.

23:39.901 --> 23:41.592
There's no such thing as a CCA.

23:41.696 --> 23:42.800
So let's get that right.

23:42.904 --> 23:45.320
[laughter]

23:45.424 --> 23:47.184
All of these, ladies andgentlemen, are here for you

Now, let me tell you--

24:08.412 --> 24:11.173

challenge was a warm up.

24:11.277 --> 24:15.971

24:16.075 --> 24:17.076

24:17.179 --> 24:18.974
GORDON RAMSAY: --over there.

24:19.078 --> 24:20.182
BENJAMIN KNACK: I
thought I was going

24:20.286 --> 24:21.736
to relax, have a
couple of drinks,

24:21.839 --> 24:22.806
hang out with the chefs--

24:22.909 --> 24:24.877
but everything I did
in this competition

24:24.980 --> 24:25.947
comes down to right now.

24:26.050 --> 24:28.846
It's all wasted if I
don't perform tonight.

24:28.950 --> 24:30.434
All three of
you've got 60 minutes

24:30.538 --> 24:32.022

And your time starts now.

24:34.334 --> 24:35.577

and gentlemen, please.

24:35.681 --> 24:36.958

24:44.759 --> 24:47.106
NARRATOR: The three
finalists battle it out.

24:47.209 --> 24:49.695

NARRATOR: But who willcompete for the greatest prize

24:52.525 --> 24:54.009
in Hell's Kitchen history?

24:54.113 --> 24:56.287
It's time to
find out which two

24:56.391 --> 25:00.050
chefs are heading into ourfirst ever All Star finale.

25:04.261 --> 25:05.642

25:10.405 --> 25:11.682
MICHELLE TRIBBLE: You too, Nick.

25:15.962 --> 25:16.791
Here we go.

25:16.894 --> 25:18.206
What am I getting on?

25:18.309 --> 25:21.036
NARRATOR: They all must now cookand perfect their final menus.

25:21.140 --> 25:22.175
BENJAMIN KNACK:
Potato puree first.

25:22.279 --> 25:23.418
KEISHA: Potato puree, yeah.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.384
BENJAMIN KNACK: Put thesaffron broth in, please.

25:24.488 --> 25:26.283
NARRATOR: But only
two will advance.

25:26.386 --> 25:28.043
CHRISTINA: OK.- I'm going to start my chicken.

25:28.147 --> 25:28.457
CHRISTINA: Perfect.
OK.

25:28.561 --> 25:29.458
Good.

25:29.562 --> 25:30.805
It's crazy to
think that these five

25:30.908 --> 25:33.186
dishes could basically decidemy fate in Hell's Kitchen.

25:33.290 --> 25:34.498
But I feel it, in my
gut, that I'm going

25:34.602 --> 25:35.741
to make it into the final two.

25:35.844 --> 25:37.570
[cheering]

25:41.712 --> 25:42.748
MICHELLE TRIBBLE:
For the hamachi,

25:42.851 --> 25:44.128
I already have that cored.

25:44.232 --> 25:45.682
The cucumber broth-- I thinkI'm going to go ahead and get

25:45.785 --> 25:47.131
the chicken on now, chef.JOCKY: Yep.

25:47.235 --> 25:48.650
MICHELLE TRIBBLE: It's
going to take a while.

25:48.754 --> 25:51.791
Not getting into the finaltwo is not an option for me.

25:51.895 --> 25:54.173
I only got third
place last time.

25:54.276 --> 25:56.244
And that's not going
to happen again.

25:56.347 --> 25:57.866
I'm going to deglaze
this chicken.

25:57.970 --> 26:00.213
I'm not going through all thisbullshit, all this drama, all

26:00.317 --> 26:01.974
this negativity for nothing.

26:02.077 --> 26:04.355
I'm going to beat
up on you every day.

26:04.459 --> 26:05.771
I'm the strongest
member of the red team.

26:05.874 --> 26:06.634
You're not.

26:06.737 --> 26:07.635
At least you're
not consistent.

26:07.738 --> 26:08.532
That's bullshit.

26:08.636 --> 26:10.223
Your lamb was raw today.

26:10.327 --> 26:11.708
Because you were
running around frazzled,

26:11.811 --> 26:12.709
not knowing where you--

26:12.812 --> 26:14.642
No, because you
kept opening the oven!

26:14.745 --> 26:16.126
You skated through
dinner service tonight.

26:16.229 --> 26:17.196
MICHELLE TRIBBLE: I did not!

26:17.299 --> 26:17.886
You are not on our
side in the kitchen.

26:17.990 --> 26:18.853
--do stations tonight.

26:18.956 --> 26:19.681
Now, you're going
to have to put

26:19.785 --> 26:20.751
your money where your mouth is.

26:20.855 --> 26:21.959
I thought you
were done arguing.

26:22.063 --> 26:23.961
[inaudible] that.

26:24.065 --> 26:27.275
So after all that, I needto get into the finale.

26:27.378 --> 26:29.449
I added lime zest to
the seaweed butter

26:29.553 --> 26:33.074
because it needed more acidity.

26:33.177 --> 26:34.454
Do y'all have the time?

26:34.558 --> 26:35.352
20 minutes down.

26:35.455 --> 26:37.596
[tense music playing]

26:38.597 --> 26:39.874
The first dish is ready.

26:39.977 --> 26:41.013
KEISHA: Awesome.

26:41.116 --> 26:42.083
BENJAMIN KNACK: After I
get these fillets going,

26:42.186 --> 26:43.740
I'm going to start
working on shrimp, chef.

26:43.843 --> 26:45.500
This is the biggest
challenge yet.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.261
Someone's going home, and I needto be focused on the dishes.

26:48.365 --> 26:50.194
But at the same time, I canhear 200 people cheering

26:50.298 --> 26:51.195
my name in the background.

26:51.299 --> 26:53.612
[chanting "let's go benjamin"]

26:55.855 --> 26:57.546
KEISHA: You OK, there?

26:57.650 --> 26:59.479
You know, having that
many people around you

26:59.583 --> 27:01.516
while you're cooking
can be intimidating.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.517
But it's amazing.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.002
Let's go, Ben.

27:05.106 --> 27:06.383
You ever cooked with
an audience before?

27:06.486 --> 27:08.109
[chuckles] No, chef.
[laughter]

27:09.110 --> 27:11.043
Let's go, Ben.

27:11.146 --> 27:13.183
[inaudible] This is
definitely the biggest

27:13.286 --> 27:15.081
crowd that I've evercooked in front of before.

27:15.185 --> 27:16.669
And this is a lot
of fucking people.

27:16.773 --> 27:18.222
It's definitely
sink or swim time.

27:18.326 --> 27:20.984
We are cooking for our
lives, and this is it.

27:21.087 --> 27:22.192
I think what tripped
me up last time

27:22.295 --> 27:24.159
was my hollandaise
and beurre blanc.

27:24.263 --> 27:25.333
So I'm going to
get that going now.

27:25.436 --> 27:26.783
Learning from my mistakesfrom this morning.

27:26.886 --> 27:28.474
My beurre blanc is
turning out perfect.

27:28.577 --> 27:29.889
My hollandaise is
turning out great.

27:29.993 --> 27:31.857
And, you know, I'm putting myheart and soul on the plate,

27:31.960 --> 27:33.997
and I hope that ChefRamsay sees that tonight.

27:34.100 --> 27:35.688
CHRISTINA: And you'rewatching these carrots, Nick?

27:35.792 --> 27:36.896
Or do you me to
keep an eye on them?

27:37.000 --> 27:37.966
I'm watching them, chef.

27:38.070 --> 27:38.795
GORDON RAMSAY: 30
minutes remaining, OK?

27:38.898 --> 27:39.761
30 minutes.
Thank you, chef.

27:39.865 --> 27:42.488
30 minutes.

27:42.591 --> 27:44.352
Whew.

27:44.455 --> 27:46.354
I am super prepared
for this challenge.

27:46.457 --> 27:48.805
I just want to take all thosenotes that Chef Ramsay gave me

27:48.908 --> 27:51.911
earlier and change these
dishes a little bit

27:52.015 --> 27:54.086
to make them the best
that they can be.

27:54.189 --> 27:56.122
I'm going to use a little bitof uzu butter on this steak.

27:56.226 --> 27:57.123
Yep.

27:57.227 --> 27:58.331
Is this enough
peas in here, chef?

27:58.435 --> 27:59.470
Or do you want more?
- Yeah.

27:59.574 --> 28:00.609
A little more, please.

28:00.713 --> 28:02.025
With Chef Ramsay's
feedback, I've

28:02.128 --> 28:05.442
taken every single thing he toldme and I adjusted my dishes.

28:05.545 --> 28:06.615
- Did you try everything?- Yeah.

28:06.719 --> 28:07.720
Everything's good.
This is finished.

28:07.824 --> 28:09.135
Does this need to be
finished with butter?

28:09.239 --> 28:10.965
You know, I'm going to changeabout the plating on the shrimp

28:11.068 --> 28:12.311
and grits, like chef suggested.

28:12.414 --> 28:15.141
I want to go with a reallybeautiful, elegant white bowl.

28:15.245 --> 28:16.936
And this time, I think
he's going to love it.

28:17.040 --> 28:17.834
Last 10 minutes.
OK?

28:17.937 --> 28:18.731
Yes, chef.

28:18.835 --> 28:19.628
- Feeling OK?
- Yeah.

28:19.732 --> 28:20.768
Yeah?

28:20.871 --> 28:22.355
This is definitely more
of what I'm looking for.

28:22.459 --> 28:23.978
Between Michelle,
Benjamin, and myself,

28:24.081 --> 28:26.290
I'm the only one left herethat has made it farther

28:26.394 --> 28:27.602
than their original season.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.880
I've definitely grown themost out of the three of us.

28:29.984 --> 28:32.331
And I'm going for the finale.

28:32.434 --> 28:33.608
BENJAMIN KNACK: Chicken is out?

28:33.712 --> 28:35.196

28:35.299 --> 28:36.507
- Pass the deduction.
- OK.

Sounds good.
Oh, OK.

ever cooked for anybody

29:50.374 --> 29:51.755

making this finaldecision, but these people

29:55.897 --> 29:57.761

Or is it Nick?

36:56.352 --> 36:57.215
[sigh]

37:00.701 --> 37:01.598
[humming]

37:06.085 --> 37:07.984
[energetic music playing]

37:08.087 --> 37:09.365
NARRATOR: For their
final challenge,

37:09.468 --> 37:13.161
the three remaining chefshave each prepared five dishes

37:13.265 --> 37:16.061
to help determine which
two will go head to head

37:16.164 --> 37:17.856
in the final dinner service.

37:17.959 --> 37:19.167
Those dishes look incredible.

37:19.271 --> 37:20.548
Well done.

37:20.652 --> 37:22.999
NARRATOR: President and CEO ofCaesars Entertainment group,

37:23.102 --> 37:25.277
Mark Frissora, has
already selected

37:25.381 --> 37:27.417
Michelle as the first finalist.

37:27.521 --> 37:28.349
Michelle.

37:28.453 --> 37:30.627
[cheering]

37:30.731 --> 37:34.252
NARRATOR: And it's now time todecide who will be joining her.

37:34.355 --> 37:35.598
GORDON RAMSAY: Is it Benjamin?

37:35.701 --> 37:36.564
Or is it Nick?

37:45.055 --> 37:45.849
Benjamin.

37:45.953 --> 37:46.850
Benjamin!

37:46.954 --> 37:49.267
[cheering]

37:51.890 --> 37:53.340
All my hard work has paid off.

37:53.443 --> 37:54.996
And now, I'm going
to bring it tomorrow.

37:55.100 --> 37:56.826
And Michelle, I'm going
to be the new chef

37:56.929 --> 38:00.485
in Las Vegas at Hell's Kitchen.

38:00.588 --> 38:02.659
It sucks that it camedown to basically one dish,

38:02.763 --> 38:05.006
even though you've put somuch effort into your food.

38:05.110 --> 38:06.525
You obviously think that
some of your dishes,

38:06.629 --> 38:09.217
if not all of them, were betterthan most of their dishes.

38:09.321 --> 38:11.081
Just knowing you lost,
and you've disappointed

38:11.185 --> 38:12.669
your sous chef and your chef--

38:12.773 --> 38:14.257
no one wants to
have that feeling.

38:14.361 --> 38:15.569
[sigh]

38:15.672 --> 38:16.915
GORDON RAMSAY: Now, Nick.

38:17.018 --> 38:18.572
As you know, your time inHell's Kitchen is not over yet--

38:18.675 --> 38:19.918
NICK PETERS: Yes, chef.

38:20.021 --> 38:21.678
GORDON RAMSAY: --because youwill be joining the brigade

38:21.782 --> 38:23.370
of one of the two finalists--

38:23.473 --> 38:25.682
Benjamin or Michelle--
when they face off

38:25.786 --> 38:27.201
in the final dinner
service tomorrow

38:27.305 --> 38:29.307
night back in Hell's Kitchen.

38:29.410 --> 38:31.516
But, as you know, it
takes more than one chef

38:31.619 --> 38:32.827
to fill out a brigade.

38:32.931 --> 38:35.796
So please welcome back ourold staff-- returning chefs.

38:35.899 --> 38:38.074
[cheering]

38:39.558 --> 38:44.563
GORDON RAMSAY: Dana,
Robyn, Jennifer,

38:44.667 --> 38:50.776
Elise, Van, Barbie, and Milly.

38:50.880 --> 38:53.123
Nick, please go and join them.

38:53.227 --> 38:54.884
Thank you.

38:54.987 --> 38:57.611
Oh, man.

38:57.714 --> 38:58.715
Great.

38:58.819 --> 39:00.510
Michelle, come and
stand here, please.

39:00.614 --> 39:03.479
Benjamin, stand here.

39:03.582 --> 39:04.549
Right.

39:04.652 --> 39:07.552
Michelle, you go first
on the pick to put

39:07.655 --> 39:10.175
your dream team together.

39:10.278 --> 39:12.522
Now, when you look at allthose returning chefs,

39:12.626 --> 39:13.937
you know them inside out.

39:14.041 --> 39:16.492
They've been with you every stepof the way across this journey.

39:16.595 --> 39:19.080
Please, give us the
name of the first person

39:19.184 --> 39:22.187
that you'd like to join, andtell us why first, please.

39:22.290 --> 39:24.292
Michelle has first
choice pick-- and I

39:24.396 --> 39:25.501
fucking better be on her team.

39:25.604 --> 39:26.398
She better pick me.

39:26.502 --> 39:28.124
If she didn't, I'd be pissed.

39:28.227 --> 39:29.884
I'm choosing this
person because they

39:29.988 --> 39:31.230
never faltered this season.

39:31.334 --> 39:33.750
They were the best competitorin all the challenges

39:33.854 --> 39:34.648
and dinner service.

39:34.751 --> 39:35.649
And that person is Nick.

39:35.752 --> 39:36.581
GORDON RAMSAY: Nick, please.

39:36.684 --> 39:39.342
[cheering]

39:39.446 --> 39:40.481
MICHELLE TRIBBLE:
It's obvious why

39:40.585 --> 39:41.724
Nick is my number one choice.

39:41.827 --> 39:42.690
We are great friends.

39:42.794 --> 39:44.105
He's a solid cook.

39:44.209 --> 39:46.073
I honestly thought it was goingto be me and him in the finals.

39:46.176 --> 39:46.970
Wow.

39:47.074 --> 39:48.282
What a night.

39:48.386 --> 39:51.181
Benjamin, who is going tobe first in your brigade?

39:51.285 --> 39:52.355
Chef, I'm going
to choose someone

39:52.459 --> 39:53.701
I've cooked with
in the past, I've

39:53.805 --> 39:55.462
competed with in the past--

39:55.565 --> 39:58.706
someone who has my
style of cooking.

39:58.810 --> 39:59.707
I'm going to pick Jennifer.

39:59.811 --> 40:00.605
Wow.

40:03.366 --> 40:04.678
I picked Jennifer
first because I

40:04.781 --> 40:07.577
knew that Michelle liked her,so I wanted to take her away.

40:07.681 --> 40:08.475
GORDON RAMSAY: Right.

40:08.578 --> 40:10.200
Michelle-- second pick.

40:10.304 --> 40:12.686
[suspenseful music playing]

40:12.789 --> 40:15.723
My next choice was a formermember of the red team.

40:15.827 --> 40:18.277
She always brought it everysingle day, in challenges

40:18.381 --> 40:19.382
and dinner service, as well.

40:19.486 --> 40:21.211
So my next pick is Dana.

40:21.315 --> 40:22.592
[applause]
GORDON RAMSAY: Dana.

40:22.696 --> 40:23.455
Let's go.

40:29.806 --> 40:31.325
Good to see you, Dana.

40:31.429 --> 40:32.671
Right.

40:32.775 --> 40:33.776
Benjamin-- second pick.

40:33.879 --> 40:34.742
Tell us who.

40:34.846 --> 40:36.399
My next pick is
someone who cooks

40:36.503 --> 40:39.402
with a lot of passion and soul--cooks food from the heart.

40:39.506 --> 40:43.371
He has fine dining training, andhe's as technical as anything--

40:43.475 --> 40:44.269
Van.

40:44.372 --> 40:45.166
Thank you.

40:45.270 --> 40:46.582
[applause]

40:46.685 --> 40:47.824
That's my boy.

40:47.928 --> 40:49.412
And we'll kill it
for Ben tomorrow.

40:49.516 --> 40:50.309
Welcome back.

40:50.413 --> 40:51.656
Are you good?

40:51.759 --> 40:52.553
Nice to see you.

40:52.657 --> 40:53.451
OK.

40:53.554 --> 40:54.348
Michelle?

40:56.488 --> 40:58.628
Jeff, the next person
I'm going to pick I know

40:58.732 --> 41:00.216
is going to have my back.

41:00.319 --> 41:01.838
I worked with him in season 14.

41:01.942 --> 41:02.736
I've got to go with Milly.

41:02.839 --> 41:03.702
Yeah, Milly!

41:03.806 --> 41:04.600
GORDON RAMSAY: Let's go.

41:04.703 --> 41:06.325
[applause]

41:08.120 --> 41:08.949
Right.

41:09.052 --> 41:10.122
Benjamin-- third pick.

41:10.226 --> 41:11.469
Next person I'm
going to pick is,

41:11.572 --> 41:13.091
once again, a passionate chef.

41:13.194 --> 41:14.472
She was with the
red team before,

41:14.575 --> 41:16.922
and she came to the blueteam and showed what she had.

41:17.026 --> 41:17.958
I'm going to pick Robyn, chef.

41:18.061 --> 41:18.855
GORDON RAMSAY: Robyn.

41:18.959 --> 41:20.581
Welcome back.

41:20.685 --> 41:23.446
If you want me to
be completely honest,

41:23.550 --> 41:24.654
the selection was kind of slim.

41:24.758 --> 41:27.070
I kind of knew I had to gobefore Barbie and Elise.

41:27.174 --> 41:29.141
So Michelle-- last pick?

41:29.245 --> 41:30.798
Effectively, you're
choosing for both teams.

41:34.215 --> 41:39.186
I'm literally stuck betweena rock and a hard place.

41:39.289 --> 41:40.705
Elise is the hard place--

41:40.808 --> 41:41.844
It's on.

41:41.947 --> 41:43.121
Oh.

41:43.224 --> 41:44.605
You're opening a can of worms.

41:44.709 --> 41:46.883
It's on now, baby.

41:46.987 --> 41:47.815
GORDON RAMSAY: OK, Michelle.

41:47.919 --> 41:49.576
Please give us a name.

41:49.679 --> 41:51.129
MICHELLE TRIBBLE:
--and Barbie is crazy.

41:51.232 --> 41:52.751
I need that spinach, please.

41:52.855 --> 41:53.787
Worry about your beef.

41:53.890 --> 41:56.272
How about I get that
spinach, Michelle?

41:56.375 --> 41:59.931
Chef, the next person I'mgoing to pick on my team--

42:00.034 --> 42:01.415
I don't want Elise.

42:01.519 --> 42:02.416
I don't want Barbie.

42:02.520 --> 42:03.866
I don't want either of them.

42:07.317 --> 42:09.181
[whoosh]

42:09.285 --> 42:12.150
NARRATOR: Next time,
one of these two chefs

42:12.253 --> 42:14.946
will be named the winner ofHell's Kitchen All Stars.

42:15.049 --> 42:16.568
I need to end
on a strong note.

42:16.672 --> 42:18.225
I got third place last time.

42:18.328 --> 42:19.640
That's not going
to happen again.

42:19.744 --> 42:21.711
NARRATOR: --and the head
chef at Gordon Ramsay's

42:21.815 --> 42:25.439

42:25.543 --> 42:27.545
That's the Hell's Kitchen Iwant to be the head chef at.

42:27.648 --> 42:28.822
NARRATOR: Will it be Michelle--

42:28.925 --> 42:30.064
We need to keep rolling.

42:30.168 --> 42:30.962
Yes, chef?

42:31.065 --> 42:32.342
Yes, chef.

42:32.446 --> 42:34.310

42:36.795 --> 42:37.589
Y'all got it?

I need [inaudible].

42:45.908 --> 42:46.874
Walk.

42:46.978 --> 42:48.186
I'm the best chef
here, and I'm going

42:48.289 --> 42:49.394
to prove it to Chef Ramsay.

42:49.497 --> 42:50.429
NARRATOR: Who--

42:50.533 --> 42:51.327
On the count of three--
