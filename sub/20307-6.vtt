WEBVTT

00:04.129 --> 00:06.339
-Another omelet, Officer?
-Mmm, no, thanks, baby.

00:06.423 --> 00:08.550
I got more than I can handle
already. I'm running late.

00:08.633 --> 00:10.927
-Kenny, eat your breakfast.
-I want what Neal has!

00:11.011 --> 00:13.847
I already asked you what you
wanted, and you said cereal.

00:13.930 --> 00:16.349
-Now, eat it.
-Take it easy, honey.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.601
I'm sorry, Neal.
I'm just worried about dinner.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.978
You can make it tonight?

00:20.061 --> 00:21.938
Mm, how many times do I have to say it?

00:22.022 --> 00:23.732
I'm 80% sure I'll be here, baby.

00:23.815 --> 00:26.776
WOMAN: You were 90% sure the last time
mother took two buses to get here,

00:26.860 --> 00:29.195
and you didn't even show.
You didn't even call!

00:29.279 --> 00:31.531
Baby, I'll do everything I can
to make it by 8:00, okay?

00:31.614 --> 00:34.284
It's a busy time down at the precinct.
A lot of stuff going down.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.077
-You always--
-Hey, hey, no, no.

00:36.161 --> 00:39.456
-I got it. I got it. No sweat, baby.
-It's just that I can never plan anything!

00:39.539 --> 00:40.957
I never know anything!

00:41.041 --> 00:45.253
-NEAL: Hey, you know one thing, Lynette--
-It's okay, Mom. He'll be here.

00:45.336 --> 00:47.839
-Won't you, Neal?
-Yeah. Sure.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.300
I'll make it somehow. 7:00 sharp.

00:50.383 --> 00:51.885
Don't you worry. Hey, I got to go.

00:53.094 --> 00:54.763
And you, pay attention in school, okay?

00:54.846 --> 00:55.805
-(groans)
-Okay.

01:00.351 --> 01:01.519
All right, see y'all later.

01:02.771 --> 01:05.106
-Officer...
-Yeah?

01:05.190 --> 01:07.275
-Can I do something for you, miss?
-Maybe.

01:07.358 --> 01:08.777
Oh.

01:10.987 --> 01:13.490
Item seven.
This is a memo from our friends

01:13.573 --> 01:15.950
at the Suicide Prevention Center.

01:16.034 --> 01:19.662
Statistics are showing
nearly a 500% increase

01:19.746 --> 01:23.500
in what looks like self-induced
fatalities among vagrants.

01:23.583 --> 01:26.169
Now, to put this straightforward, people,

01:26.252 --> 01:30.048
six men have been found
looking like all-beef patties

01:30.131 --> 01:32.509
after having fallen from high places.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.552
Mick Belker's going to do an undercover

01:34.636 --> 01:37.055
to see if there's
any evidence of foul play.

01:37.138 --> 01:39.682
-Item eight: ongoings.
-(laughter)

01:39.766 --> 01:41.351
Halloran and Dickerson.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.103
Newman rides with O'Malley.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.395
Item nine.

01:44.479 --> 01:47.190
The Arts Council
is unveiling a piece of artwork

01:47.273 --> 01:49.400
over at the Anderson Savings Plaza.

01:49.484 --> 01:52.112
Now, there's going to be
speeches, and the Arts Council

01:52.195 --> 01:54.405
has requested minimal police presence.

01:54.489 --> 01:57.659
Coffey, Sergeant Bates, you're art lovers.

01:57.742 --> 01:59.494
-(laughter)
-You draw the plum.

01:59.577 --> 02:00.829
Okay, item ten.

02:01.621 --> 02:04.666
Item ten, people, F.Y.I.,

02:05.875 --> 02:09.379
I just got word from Convoy
over at Midtown,

02:09.462 --> 02:12.048
I.A.D. went after one of their uniforms

02:12.132 --> 02:15.260
for accepting a 25-cent newspaper

02:15.343 --> 02:17.929
from the blind guy
out in front of the courthouse.

02:18.012 --> 02:19.430
-(groaning)
-MAN: Come on!

02:19.514 --> 02:21.391
JABLONSKI: I don't care
if it's a green stamp

02:21.474 --> 02:23.017
worth 1/10 of a mill.

02:23.101 --> 02:23.977
Don't.

02:24.769 --> 02:27.522
These ten days since
the Furillo Commission has wound up

02:27.605 --> 02:30.150
have created a whole new
atmosphere downtownâ€¦

02:30.233 --> 02:31.359
mean.

02:32.902 --> 02:34.070
A word to the wise.

02:34.863 --> 02:38.783
Okay, um, item ten, uh, it's a no,
11, last item.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.202
Lieutenant Buntz
is going to be late today.

02:41.286 --> 02:44.497
-He's having emergency oral surgery.
-(laughter)

02:44.581 --> 02:46.958
His breath smells worse than
two razorback hogs

02:47.041 --> 02:48.543
come mating season.

02:48.626 --> 02:49.752
Smell like a big old pig.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.005
There something you want to say, Andy?

02:52.088 --> 02:54.257
What? No. Nothing.

02:54.340 --> 02:57.343
-(laughter)
-Okay. Let's go!

02:57.427 --> 02:58.970
They're getting away out there.

02:59.053 --> 03:00.513
(indistinct chattering)

03:08.855 --> 03:10.106
Come on. Move it, pal.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.441
-(horn honks)
-Hey.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.450
(grunts) I don't have any money!

03:21.201 --> 03:23.369
Hey, come on! Hey, come on! Come on!

03:24.621 --> 03:27.123
-Hey! Police!
-I told you! I don't have any money!

03:27.207 --> 03:28.208
Hey!

03:32.337 --> 03:33.338
You okay?

03:33.796 --> 03:34.797
Move!

03:50.521 --> 03:53.107
All right. Hide-and-seek's over, creep.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.150
Come on out.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.207
I give! I give!

04:10.500 --> 04:12.085
(both grunting)

04:13.920 --> 04:15.546
(panting)

04:17.298 --> 04:19.467
(screams)

04:21.803 --> 04:23.721
(both grunting)

04:44.325 --> 04:46.869
-(grunts)
-(groans)

04:49.747 --> 04:51.666
Come on, sucker! You want some more? Huh?

04:51.749 --> 04:53.293
Beause I'm just getting started.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.298
I don't believe this.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.466
Ain't that too bad? Breaks my heart.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.135
Hey, you're under arrest.

05:02.218 --> 05:03.678
You got the right to remain silent,

05:03.761 --> 05:05.888
and unless you want the rest
of your face kicked in,

05:05.972 --> 05:08.057
I'd strongly advise you
to exercise that right.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.559
Hey, you listen to me, Jack.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.520
All you got is a rouse,
because I don't see no crime, dig?

05:12.603 --> 05:14.564
No, no. I do see one.

05:14.647 --> 05:17.608
I see false arrest real clear. Yeah.

05:17.692 --> 05:20.778
Shut up and eat your breakfast,
butt-face, huh?

05:20.862 --> 05:22.280
Go ahead, man.

05:22.363 --> 05:24.741
Don't bother me none,
because that's police brutality.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.243
You see this face?
That's a brutalized face.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.662
You could go bald real fast,
you know that?

05:29.746 --> 05:31.456
You got the right to remain silent.

05:31.539 --> 05:33.583
If you give up that right,
anything you say can--

05:33.666 --> 05:36.961
-(spits)
-Hey! My upholstery, you slime bucket!

05:37.045 --> 05:38.671
(groans)

05:38.755 --> 05:41.883
(panting) Now, here's how it goes, pal,

05:41.966 --> 05:43.343
this is class here,

05:43.426 --> 05:46.220
and you don't ever want to spit on class!

05:46.304 --> 05:48.598
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:48.681 --> 05:50.808
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

05:50.892 --> 05:54.729
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:01.944 --> 06:05.365
(theme music playing)

07:29.866 --> 07:32.702
Hey, look, I just went up there
with an open mind.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.829
What happens at them
psychic fairs, anyhow?

07:34.912 --> 07:37.248
It's great. They got all these
hippie mystical chicks.

07:37.331 --> 07:40.334
-They're practically swimming in them.
-That's where you met this Tara.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.670
Yeah, who happened to be
the one that wasn't like that.

07:42.753 --> 07:45.548
She's one heavy broad.
She had me sweating, hearing voices.

07:45.631 --> 07:46.674
Sounds pretty wild.

07:46.757 --> 07:49.510
You guys got to try
past-life therapy. Not kidding you.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.429
Uh-uh. I got my hands full with this life.

07:51.512 --> 07:54.223
See how easy it is to be cynical?
What have you got to lose?

07:54.307 --> 07:56.684
No, J.D., the question is,
what's your stake in this?

07:56.767 --> 07:58.728
Well, it's nothing.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.521
The first session is on the house.

08:00.605 --> 08:03.566
If you go for the whole treatment,
I make a couple of bucks.

08:03.649 --> 08:04.775
I'll pass.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.903
One of these things here, J.D.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.447
It's funny,
I once had some laughing gas one time,

08:09.530 --> 08:11.741
and I thought I was a pony
soldier out west somewhere.

08:11.824 --> 08:14.952
That is your past life trying
to break into the present.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.663
-That's the whole thing right there.
-You sure it's free?

08:17.747 --> 08:21.375
Hey, one full introductory hour
of the therapist's time.

08:21.459 --> 08:24.086
It was real weird. It was like,
uh, these mountains,

08:24.170 --> 08:25.963
and there was this big old pink sun,

08:26.047 --> 08:27.882
and then like an eyeball looking at me.

08:27.965 --> 08:29.675
It was real weird.

08:29.759 --> 08:33.387
There's her number.
It's only gonna change your entire life.

08:34.263 --> 08:37.475
What's that they say about
one being reborn every minute?

08:39.477 --> 08:42.980
MAN: I'm bursting with pride today.
I'm proud of all of us.

08:43.064 --> 08:45.900
The Arts Council for their devoted work.

08:45.983 --> 08:47.109
(applause)

08:47.193 --> 08:50.112
Mr. Eccle and the Anderson Savings Bank

08:50.196 --> 08:53.115
-for their interest and commitment.
-(applause)

08:53.199 --> 08:57.203
But most of all,
I'm proud of Bobby Castro,

08:58.120 --> 08:59.622
a local artist

09:00.540 --> 09:03.167
who has labored long and hard,

09:03.251 --> 09:06.170
but whose vision will finally be available

09:06.254 --> 09:08.506
for all to see and savor--

09:08.589 --> 09:10.299
Cut the bebop, man. (chuckles)

09:10.383 --> 09:13.094
Well, Bobby, would you, uh,
would you like to, uh,

09:13.177 --> 09:15.137
say a few words
before the actual unveiling?

09:15.221 --> 09:16.722
(applause)

09:16.806 --> 09:18.724
WOMAN: Come on, Bobby.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.936
(clears throat)
Uh, well, a lot of people ask me

09:22.019 --> 09:25.064
why I call this piece "Kataz Number 39."

09:25.147 --> 09:29.318
Now, you know,
I could tell you some jive philosophy

09:29.402 --> 09:31.696
about the meaning of this sculpture,

09:31.779 --> 09:32.947
but, like, hey,

09:33.030 --> 09:36.325
I did not make the thing
to be explained, all right?

09:36.409 --> 09:39.954
So, uh, let's see the sucker.

09:40.037 --> 09:42.456
(applause)

09:45.251 --> 09:48.921
Well, let's... crank her up, huh?

09:49.005 --> 09:51.173
(mechanical humming)

09:53.009 --> 09:55.595
(laughter)

09:58.681 --> 10:00.224
That's a spaceship.

10:00.308 --> 10:02.226
Looks more like a giant cigar to me.

10:02.310 --> 10:05.521
(indistinct voices)

10:05.605 --> 10:07.440
That's a man's private part!

10:07.523 --> 10:10.026
-That's a--
-(laughter continues)

10:20.494 --> 10:22.705
Mr. Wendell Morrison? I'm Joyce Davenport.

10:22.788 --> 10:25.458
-I'll be representing you.
-This is your lucky day, Counselor,

10:25.541 --> 10:29.003
because rat face comes out of nowhere,
starts whacking me in the alley.

10:29.086 --> 10:30.921
We're talking police brutality,

10:31.005 --> 10:33.758
brutalizing my eyes,
brutalizing my nose, brutalizing my back--

10:33.841 --> 10:35.926
Let me guess.
You're claiming resisting arrest.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.053
You got it.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.763
You think I tattooed these bruises on?

10:38.846 --> 10:41.182
You look a lot healthier
than my client, Lieutenant.

10:41.265 --> 10:42.600
Maybe I got a harder head.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.352
Or maybe you got an uglier face.

10:44.435 --> 10:46.812
Maybe you got a civil suit
coming your way, Jackson.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.439
Man offered me a concussion.

10:48.522 --> 10:50.566
That was contusion, Miss Davenport.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.859
Here's his medical report.

10:51.942 --> 10:55.529
You know, Wendell, even for a
moron, you don't talk too good.

10:55.613 --> 10:56.697
Excuse me.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.116
Um, have you seen Detective Washington?

10:59.200 --> 11:00.201
He's right over there.

11:00.284 --> 11:02.286
-Oh. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

11:06.290 --> 11:09.627
-Hi, Neal.
-Hey. Hey, baby. What's happening?

11:10.711 --> 11:13.005
Oh, I'm sorry to disturb you at work,

11:13.089 --> 11:14.715
but I need to talk to you for a minute.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.592
Uh, yeah, yeah. Right here.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.679
Yes, ma'am. On my lunch hour,
say about 12:00?

11:21.180 --> 11:24.141
Well, uh, I did have this experience once,

11:24.225 --> 11:25.851
but I can't talk about it right now

11:25.935 --> 11:28.688
because, uh, some of
my fellow officers happen to have

11:28.771 --> 11:30.940
what you'd call closed minds.

11:31.023 --> 11:33.818
Yeah, see you then.
I'm looking forward to it, Miss Tara.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.822
You would think a man
had a better thing to do

11:37.905 --> 11:40.449
than to spy upon his partner.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.784
Let us go.

11:43.452 --> 11:46.288
I've been thinking about
what happened at breakfast this morning,

11:46.372 --> 11:47.832
and I'm really upset,

11:47.915 --> 11:50.668
and I didn't want to go into dinner
without making things right.

11:50.751 --> 11:54.463
-Hey, it's okay, baby. Forget about it.
-Oh, Neal, I hate it when we fight.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.383
And then, afterwards, Kenny got all upset.

11:57.466 --> 11:59.468
-What happened with Kenny?
-He started crying,

11:59.552 --> 12:02.888
and he wouldn't finish his breakfast,
and then he didn't want to go to school.

12:02.972 --> 12:06.434
(sighs) Neal, he's crazy about you,
but he's so sensitive.

12:06.517 --> 12:10.187
When his father would drink,
he was... he was awful to him.

12:10.271 --> 12:13.065
Hey, tell you what, what if I go
over to his school at lunchtime

12:13.149 --> 12:14.316
and check him out, hmm?

12:15.025 --> 12:16.861
Oh, Neal, I really appreciate this.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.531
And I do know how hard
they're working you.

12:26.495 --> 12:27.997
Norm, my office.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.254
(clears throat) What's the good word?

12:35.337 --> 12:36.589
Close the door.

12:41.093 --> 12:43.763
Has the complainant come forward
on the Morrison case?

12:43.846 --> 12:46.807
Eh, the guy's a little hinky.
It's no big deal.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.225
Do we have his sheet?

12:48.309 --> 12:51.312
Yeah, he's from Oklahoma.
His out-of-states didn't print.

12:51.395 --> 12:54.607
According to Morrison's attorney,
your altercation this morning

12:54.690 --> 12:56.567
left him with a hairline
fracture of the jaw.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.444
Hey, he smacked me in the mouth, huh?

12:58.527 --> 13:00.571
I mean, I just had some dental work.

13:00.654 --> 13:02.114
And on top of that,

13:02.198 --> 13:04.533
-he spat on my upholstery.
-I don't care if he puked

13:04.617 --> 13:06.327
-on your upholstery.
-We're not talking

13:06.410 --> 13:08.204
about your ordinary purse snatcher here.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.080
I mean, this guy's a regular cro-magnon.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.874
This was a good bust.

13:11.957 --> 13:15.252
I mean, it's not like I put
a bag on him or anything.

13:15.336 --> 13:18.923
-You expect points for that?
-(clears throat) Due respect,

13:19.006 --> 13:22.259
this don't have to do with Mrs. Furillo
representing that tube steak?

13:22.343 --> 13:25.596
It has to do with A.D.A.
Bernstein's having fits

13:25.679 --> 13:27.973
that Morrison is going to
hit us with a civil suit,

13:28.057 --> 13:30.059
and best guess is, right now he could win.

13:30.142 --> 13:33.020
Uh-huh. Not if we pulled down
that bakery-truck driver.

13:33.103 --> 13:35.481
I know where he works.
I'm on my way there now.

13:35.564 --> 13:37.441
Believe me, I know what I'm doing here.

13:37.525 --> 13:38.776
You've got to let me handle it.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.319
You keep me apprised, you understand?

13:40.402 --> 13:42.196
-No problem.
-On the other subject,

13:42.279 --> 13:44.365
what you're inferring
about Miss Davenport,

13:44.448 --> 13:46.492
that's wrong, and it's insulting.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.452
There are no special favors
granted up here.

13:48.536 --> 13:49.954
Okay. Yeah.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.580
You got that now?

13:51.664 --> 13:53.249
Yeah, I got it.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.752
MAN: Ain't no use talking about it.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.963
I knows what happened to Larry.

13:59.046 --> 14:00.673
Larry was a jumper.

14:01.465 --> 14:04.510
Larry was no jumper. Larry knew stuff.

14:04.593 --> 14:06.095
Could've been a sportscaster.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.763
Larry was a jumper, Earl.

14:07.847 --> 14:11.058
Think maybe Larry jumped off
the Penrose Theater?

14:11.141 --> 14:12.726
Did I say that?

14:12.810 --> 14:14.728
He was a jumper in high school.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.772
Held the city broad-jump record.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.232
Yeah.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.818
He was down, but he wasn't out.

14:20.901 --> 14:22.611
Larry was a fighter.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.407
(laughing) Except when he was drunk.

14:26.490 --> 14:29.159
I saw some brothers try to
take his money one night,

14:29.994 --> 14:32.329
and Larry down-stroked the guy good!

14:33.455 --> 14:34.915
You know who got him?

14:39.253 --> 14:40.713
The goat man got him.

14:40.796 --> 14:42.423
Right, the goat man.

14:43.090 --> 14:46.218
They got other names for him,
but I don't call him that.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.346
The man is 12 feet tall,

14:49.430 --> 14:51.223
got horns on his head,

14:52.057 --> 14:54.810
got a voice like chalk on a blackboard.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.437
MAN: Wasn't no goat man.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.315
Ask me, it was the little dudes.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.358
-You mean the pixies?
-Mm-hmm.

15:01.442 --> 15:03.444
Because pixies will mess you up.

15:03.527 --> 15:04.987
Who are they?

15:05.070 --> 15:07.156
It was these two white dudes.

15:07.239 --> 15:10.284
Real downtown, real friendly.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.912
Soft voices. Come out of a dream.

15:12.995 --> 15:16.206
-What did they say?
-Now, what you want to know for?

15:16.290 --> 15:18.083
How I know you ain't with them?

15:18.167 --> 15:19.335
I ain't with anybody!

15:19.418 --> 15:21.962
I'm trying to watch out for myself.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.214
Yeah. I can dig that.

15:24.798 --> 15:26.884
Well, you just stay away from them dudes,

15:26.967 --> 15:28.302
and you'll be okay.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.227
Mr. Fox, you don't understand.

15:37.311 --> 15:40.064
Either you sign that complaint
or the guy walks.

15:40.147 --> 15:41.857
You still don't get it, do you?

15:41.941 --> 15:43.525
This morning was a lovely day.

15:43.609 --> 15:47.112
The sun was out, the birds in the sky,
the smell of warm bread.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.198
I'm telling you,
he's gonna do somebody else,

15:49.281 --> 15:51.116
-maybe kill them.
-That's their problem.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.286
What do you mean their problem?
What are you, some kind of little girl?

15:54.370 --> 15:57.289
-This is our problem!
-I'm 52 years old.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.959
I got a duodenal ulcer.

16:00.042 --> 16:02.586
I got high blood pressure
that looks like old faithful.

16:03.337 --> 16:06.966
-Say I sign this complaint. What happens?
-Morrison's history. That's what happens.

16:07.049 --> 16:10.594
Well, here's your history:
ten months, a year at the outside.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.596
Then old pump daddy
is back out on the street

16:12.680 --> 16:14.056
and decides to pay me a visit.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.934
-I can't use that.
-Look, you ain't thinking straight.

16:17.017 --> 16:20.187
The last person this guy wants to see
is the man that put him away, huh?

16:20.270 --> 16:22.064
Well, sell it to the funny papers.

16:22.147 --> 16:23.440
I lived here all my life.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.609
I did appreciate
what you did for me this morning.

16:25.693 --> 16:28.237
Yeah, right!
I hope your ulcer pops on you!

16:28.320 --> 16:29.989
I hope you get seven heart attacks,

16:30.072 --> 16:32.616
-one for every day of the week!
-Calm yourself, Lieutenant.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.201
You got blood pressure, too!

16:38.455 --> 16:41.041
See how it goes? Easy does it.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.960
-Come on. You try.
-Okay.

16:44.336 --> 16:45.838
Hold it, hold it, hold it. No. Here.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.340
There you go. Hold it right here
in the middle of your head.

16:48.424 --> 16:49.925
That's so you line it up just right.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.885
Now, jump a little and shoot. Go ahead.

16:52.511 --> 16:53.554
(grunts)

16:54.430 --> 16:56.265
Eh, it takes a little practice.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.683
Come on. Let's do it again.

16:59.893 --> 17:02.062
Mm-hmm. That's it. Now go ahead.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.774
Hey! All right, my man!

17:05.858 --> 17:07.985
(laughs)

17:09.737 --> 17:11.113
Are you gonna marry my mom?

17:11.196 --> 17:14.742
(laughs)

17:14.825 --> 17:16.994
Whoo! You don't waste no time, do you?

17:18.162 --> 17:19.830
Hey, it's not that easy, Ken.

17:21.081 --> 17:23.500
I mean, it takes time
for people to get together.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.586
How come? You like her, don't you?

17:26.795 --> 17:29.256
Yeah, sure. I like her a lot.

17:30.382 --> 17:33.761
But, you see, after you
get to be a certain age,

17:34.303 --> 17:36.221
you get kind of used to being alone.

17:39.433 --> 17:41.643
It's just that, uh, the guys,

17:41.727 --> 17:43.896
they like to do stuff
a certain way, you know?

17:44.772 --> 17:47.983
I mean, you used to throw your
toys all over the room, right?

17:48.067 --> 17:50.402
And you thought that was okay, hmm?

17:50.486 --> 17:52.946
And then I came along and said,
"Young man, clean them up."

17:53.030 --> 17:55.657
Now, don't that seem a little
weird to you sometimes?

17:55.741 --> 17:57.367
-Yeah.
-Uh-huh.

17:58.285 --> 17:59.953
Yeah, see, that's just what I mean.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.663
And you're only ten.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.124
Think how different it is
for people when they get older.

18:04.208 --> 18:07.419
They got to work stuff out,
get used to each other's habits.

18:08.587 --> 18:09.922
Hey, come on.

18:10.005 --> 18:12.091
Let's see that jump shot
one more time, all right?

18:14.176 --> 18:17.930
I appreciate your concern,
ma'am, but I'm not an art critic.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.349
No, I haven't seen it.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.352
Well, yes, I understand, but, well...

18:23.435 --> 18:25.729
I mean, I think I understand what it is.

18:26.897 --> 18:29.608
One man told me he thought
it was a big fish.

18:29.691 --> 18:31.527
Maybe if you thought of it that way,

18:31.610 --> 18:33.070
it would relieve your mind.

18:34.696 --> 18:37.032
There's no need to get
abusive with me, ma'am.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.909
I didn't create the darned thing.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.954
-Lieutenant Goldblume?
-Over there.

18:45.874 --> 18:47.501
Today's the day, Lieutenant.

18:50.087 --> 18:52.047
Ready for Armageddon?

18:52.131 --> 18:53.674
Counselor Greenglass.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.717
Sure. Give me a moment.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.470
Another I.R.S. hearing, Henry?

18:58.554 --> 19:00.597
They're going to be hearing an earful

19:00.681 --> 19:02.891
and seeing an awful eyeful.

19:04.893 --> 19:07.896
Yes, I'd like to join
the Shar-Pei Pet Club.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.357
You keep telling me it's about
to get straightened out,

19:10.440 --> 19:12.109
and it just keeps going on and on.

19:12.192 --> 19:14.027
Please, Lieutenant,

19:14.111 --> 19:17.948
when you grant Ed Greenglass
a 28% partnership

19:18.031 --> 19:20.617
-in your success, you've bought a worker.
-Oh, boy.

19:20.701 --> 19:24.329
A digger involved with
a million-dollar bone.

19:24.413 --> 19:27.166
Hey, we both know it's not
a million-dollar bone anymore.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.752
We got a good shot at 100,
maybe 100 and a half.

19:30.836 --> 19:34.506
-Realistically?
-Realistically, minus my 28%.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.842
Well, that's less than 75,000.

19:36.925 --> 19:39.219
I share your outrage!

19:39.303 --> 19:41.763
Maybe we're moving a little precipitously.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.599
How about I call them, cancel,

19:43.682 --> 19:44.850
-we'll reschedule...
-No.

19:44.933 --> 19:46.685
...regroup as to battle plan.

19:46.768 --> 19:49.521
-No.
-Oh, that's a fighter!

19:50.731 --> 19:53.859
Lieutenant, will there be
a complainant against Mr. Morrison

19:53.942 --> 19:55.903
-on these charges?
-Yeah.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.322
-You're looking at him.
-Don't brag about it, Buntzie.

19:58.405 --> 19:59.698
You could put out her eyes.

19:59.781 --> 20:01.909
When me and my lawyer
get through with you,

20:01.992 --> 20:03.744
you'll be sliding to work on a skateboard.

20:03.827 --> 20:06.371
Hey, Wendell, you want to make
a speech, hire a hall.

20:06.455 --> 20:07.623
Maybe I will, man.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.084
You realize you could
settle this right here?

20:11.668 --> 20:12.711
If I sign a release?

20:12.794 --> 20:15.380
That's right, and considering
the slenderness of your case,

20:15.464 --> 20:18.717
-I'd think it the prudent thing to do.
-Only slender thing about him.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.220
You can count on one thing,
Miss Davenport,

20:21.303 --> 20:23.764
I will never let this man walk.

20:23.847 --> 20:25.182
We're going to court.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.851
Play it your way, Lieutenant.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.229
But I think you can find
better ways to spend your time.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.189
Well, I'll worry about that, okay?

20:41.406 --> 20:43.075
-Hey.
-Hey, there, guy.

20:43.617 --> 20:44.910
This is a herder, Ted.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.537
MICK: What the hell do you want?

20:47.621 --> 20:49.915
No, no, that's not the question.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.417
The question is, what do you want?

20:54.253 --> 20:57.214
-What do you mean?
-I mean, what do you want?

20:57.297 --> 21:00.676
Like, do you want a meal?
Do you want a drink?

21:00.759 --> 21:01.885
Do you want a friend?

21:01.969 --> 21:03.929
Because Ted and I,
we'd like to be your friends.

21:04.721 --> 21:06.306
What is this, a joke?

21:07.015 --> 21:08.600
He thinks it's a joke, Brent.

21:09.184 --> 21:10.811
We like to help guys who need it.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.896
But you've got to trust us first.

21:12.980 --> 21:16.066
We're going to have some fun now,
me, you, and little Ted.

21:16.149 --> 21:17.818
Come on. It's okay.

21:19.236 --> 21:20.654
It's okay.

21:20.737 --> 21:22.531
We'll explain it all to you over lunch.

21:22.614 --> 21:23.782
It's okay.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.660
-(tantric music playing)
-RENKO: It's yellow,

21:26.743 --> 21:30.080
like a scarf blowing in the wind.

21:31.081 --> 21:33.292
Yes, Andrew, a yellow scarf.

21:33.375 --> 21:36.586
And there's a smell.

21:36.670 --> 21:39.006
Oh, Lord, what a smell.

21:39.756 --> 21:43.218
What smell, Andrew?
Describe the smell to Tara.

21:43.302 --> 21:46.930
It smells like horse dung.

21:47.014 --> 21:49.349
Yes! Horse dung!

21:49.433 --> 21:51.310
And dying flesh.

21:51.393 --> 21:53.020
-Look out!
-What was it, Andrew?

21:53.103 --> 21:54.688
Do you know where I am?

21:54.771 --> 21:56.648
I am at Little Bighorn,

21:56.732 --> 21:59.276
and men are dying like flies around me.

21:59.359 --> 22:00.819
Good, Andrew, good. Go on!

22:00.902 --> 22:02.904
There's only a few of us left,

22:02.988 --> 22:06.116
and the hot wind is blowing in our faces,

22:06.908 --> 22:09.703
and the wild whoops of the savages.

22:09.786 --> 22:11.038
(screams)

22:11.830 --> 22:14.207
They got me, General Custer.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.168
Why didn't you listen?

22:17.919 --> 22:19.338
You should've known.

22:22.591 --> 22:25.177
Wonderful, Andrew. Wonderful.

22:26.345 --> 22:29.264
Now, when I clap my hands three times,

22:29.348 --> 22:31.767
you will wake up in life present tense.

22:32.309 --> 22:35.395
One, two,

22:35.479 --> 22:36.730
three!

22:42.819 --> 22:44.988
For the first time in his life,

22:45.072 --> 22:47.449
J.D. Larue is telling the truth.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.952
I have lived before.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.163
You know, it doesn't have
to be what you think it is.

22:53.246 --> 22:55.832
I mean, it could be
a lot of different things.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.960
-Yeah? Like what?
-Like a guided missile.

22:59.044 --> 23:02.381
-(laughs) Yeah.
-Or a barber pole, maybe.

23:02.464 --> 23:03.757
Totem pole.

23:04.633 --> 23:05.675
Or a lipstick.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.427
It looks like a very large lipstick.

23:07.511 --> 23:10.013
Sure. A lipstick.
Yeah, that's close, Luce.

23:11.390 --> 23:14.434
It's art, Joe, okay?
It is a piece of artwork.

23:14.518 --> 23:16.520
Look, I don't know anything about art,

23:16.603 --> 23:18.188
but I do know about pornography,

23:18.271 --> 23:20.690
and I don't think people should
have to see that in public.

23:20.774 --> 23:22.734
I didn't know you were such a prude.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.486
Now, what's gotten into you?

23:24.569 --> 23:27.239
Ever since you started
going out with that sculptor.

23:27.989 --> 23:29.991
He's a potter,
and I'm not going out with him.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.827
I'm taking his class.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.578
Yeah. Well--

23:33.662 --> 23:36.123
-You think he's hitting on me.
-No, I didn't say that.

23:36.206 --> 23:38.667
It's just that lately
you've become very interested

23:38.750 --> 23:42.462
-in Mr. Sensitive's pots.
-Get your mind out of the gutter.

23:42.546 --> 23:45.215
-Oh! Oh, now who's being the prude?
-Yeah.

23:45.298 --> 23:48.885
DISPATCHER: <i>All units in the vicinity</i>
<i>of Utica and 137 Anderson Plaza,</i>

23:48.969 --> 23:50.929
<i>attempted suicide in progress.</i>

23:51.888 --> 23:54.057
-2203 responding.
-(siren wails)

23:54.141 --> 23:57.018
I told you from the jump,
nobody messes with Kataz!

23:57.102 --> 23:59.896
Kataz is located in
the solar center of the hill!

23:59.980 --> 24:02.649
It redistributes the sun's warmth
to the populace!

24:02.732 --> 24:05.402
That's all well and good, Mr. Castro,

24:05.485 --> 24:07.487
but you should be made aware

24:07.571 --> 24:10.365
that this land belongs to the Arts Council

24:10.449 --> 24:12.951
and when we approved this project,

24:13.034 --> 24:15.704
it was going to be called "Man's pride."

24:15.787 --> 24:18.081
You said it was going to be a testimony,

24:18.165 --> 24:20.917
"A testimony to the urban
struggle for dignity."

24:21.001 --> 24:22.836
That's just what it is! (laughs)

24:26.006 --> 24:27.966
Everything's completely out of control.

24:28.049 --> 24:29.384
What's going on?

24:29.468 --> 24:31.720
The Arts Council voted,
I mean, everyone agrees

24:31.803 --> 24:33.680
that this monstrosity
has to be dismantled,

24:33.763 --> 24:35.432
but Castro's intractable.

24:35.515 --> 24:36.892
Okay, we're going to talk to him.

24:36.975 --> 24:38.226
All right, bring that in here.

24:39.936 --> 24:42.105
Mr. Castro, why don't you just
come down from there?

24:42.189 --> 24:45.317
Don't come any closer, man.
I'm not afraid to die!

24:45.400 --> 24:48.612
(cheers and applause)

24:49.362 --> 24:51.198
I'm just going to come up and talk to you,

24:51.281 --> 24:52.532
and nobody's going to die.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.868
You stay down! Stay down there!

24:55.994 --> 24:58.830
-I'm warning you, man.
-Look, I understand that you're upset.

25:00.081 --> 25:01.875
I know how hard
you must've worked on this.

25:01.958 --> 25:05.086
But, Mr. Castro, this isn't
anything you want to do.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.506
I mean, not really.

25:07.589 --> 25:10.091
I know you don't want to be up there.
You know you don't want to be up there.

25:10.175 --> 25:11.843
We both know you don't wanna be up there.

25:11.927 --> 25:14.304
No, sucker, you don't know! (laughs)

25:18.266 --> 25:19.309
You all right?

25:19.851 --> 25:22.354
(crowd shouting)

25:22.437 --> 25:24.898
(laughing)

25:30.111 --> 25:33.865
You are the executor
and also a beneficiary, Mr. Goldblume?

25:33.949 --> 25:37.285
-Afraid so.
-Probate wouldn't let him resign.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.704
That's the kind of scrupulous
individual we have here.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.706
Not to waste everyone's time.

25:41.790 --> 25:44.501
This appeals officer finds
no merit to the contention

25:44.584 --> 25:46.670
that the funds in the combined estates

25:46.753 --> 25:49.256
of the deceased Paul and Gina Scrignoli

25:49.339 --> 25:51.633
were earned under
tax-exempt circumstances.

25:51.716 --> 25:53.677
Further, I find that
the documents submitted

25:53.760 --> 25:56.555
by executor Goldblume
are fraudulent fiction.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.348
Now, whoa! Just slow down--

25:58.431 --> 26:00.767
Are you aware, Mr. Goldblume,

26:00.850 --> 26:03.812
that the International
Offshore Bank of Tortuga

26:03.895 --> 26:05.981
is a nonexistent invention

26:06.064 --> 26:09.025
of one Maury Silverman and Rene Gonclaves,

26:09.109 --> 26:11.778
currently serving four-year
sentences in the Virgin Islands?

26:11.861 --> 26:14.656
I mean, really, Counselor.
You practice before us.

26:14.739 --> 26:16.783
We busted Maury six months ago.

26:16.866 --> 26:18.785
I'm taking this to tax court.

26:18.868 --> 26:20.245
Whatever you want.

26:20.328 --> 26:23.415
We are claiming 50% income tax,
plus penalties and interest.

26:23.498 --> 26:25.959
That puts Miss Scrignoli's $1.1 million

26:26.042 --> 26:29.462
at somewhere around $70,000
in hock to Uncle Sam.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.090
Are you saying,

26:32.173 --> 26:36.511
after all this, I'll owe $70,000?

26:36.595 --> 26:38.513
Only as executor of the estate.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.223
Personally, no.

26:40.307 --> 26:41.725
How about as the heir?

26:41.808 --> 26:42.809
As heir...

26:44.519 --> 26:45.687
you get nothing.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.397
This is their strategy, Lieutenant.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.441
This is their "divide and conquer."

26:49.524 --> 26:50.859
So, as your legal shield--

26:50.942 --> 26:52.986
Correction, as my 28% leech.

26:53.069 --> 26:54.738
Close it out now, Mr. Goldblume.

26:54.821 --> 26:56.615
Save us all a lot of headaches,

26:56.698 --> 26:59.034
and we'll issue you a check
for $50,000 free and clear.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.118
No way!

27:00.201 --> 27:01.786
(whispering)

27:10.003 --> 27:12.213
-100?
-(scoffs) 100?

27:13.048 --> 27:14.466
Maybe I can go to 60.

27:14.549 --> 27:15.717
-90.
-65.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.927
-80.
-Okay, 80.

27:18.511 --> 27:19.888
-I'll take it.
-Wait!

27:19.971 --> 27:22.599
-Make the deal!
-Are you crazy?!

27:22.682 --> 27:24.309
Can't you bust this guy?

27:24.392 --> 27:28.396
We don't usually pursue
the criminal aspects, but...

27:29.648 --> 27:32.108
Another glass of the old vino, eh, Mick?

27:32.192 --> 27:35.654
-Sure. Okay?
-Sure.

27:35.737 --> 27:37.113
-Ted?
-I don't know, Brent.

27:37.197 --> 27:40.158
-I'm getting kind of tanked.
-Come on! We're having fun.

27:40.241 --> 27:43.620
-Mick's having fun. Aren't you, Mick?
-Yeah, a lot of fun.

27:43.703 --> 27:44.871
(chuckles) That's good.

27:44.954 --> 27:46.164
I want you to have a good time.

27:47.332 --> 27:48.625
That's great.

27:49.793 --> 27:50.877
Why are you doing this?

27:52.420 --> 27:54.297
Well, see, it's like this, Mick.

27:54.381 --> 27:56.508
Ted and I, we're from the suburbs.

27:56.591 --> 28:00.261
What do we know about life? Gas mileage.

28:00.345 --> 28:02.972
But you, you've been there.

28:03.056 --> 28:04.808
You've been to the eye.

28:04.891 --> 28:07.435
Yeah, I've been there. That's right.

28:07.519 --> 28:08.812
Yeah, I'll bet you have.

28:08.895 --> 28:10.313
You've seen it all.

28:10.397 --> 28:13.566
Bet you had a wife once. Maybe even a kid.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.360
You ever have a kid, Mick?

28:15.443 --> 28:17.237
Yeah, sure.

28:17.320 --> 28:18.488
What was his name, Mick?

28:23.201 --> 28:24.119
Joey.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.787
Joey! That's great.

28:25.870 --> 28:27.497
I'll bet you miss him, huh?

28:29.290 --> 28:30.709
Yeah, sometimes.

28:30.792 --> 28:33.211
It'd be great if you could see
him again, huh, Mick?

28:33.294 --> 28:34.254
No.

28:34.337 --> 28:36.798
Oh, no, that wouldn't be so great,
would it, Mick?

28:36.881 --> 28:40.218
-Not the way you are now.
-What could I say to him?

28:40.927 --> 28:43.304
I don't know, Mick. I never left a kid.

28:43.388 --> 28:44.889
Here, come on, cheer up.

28:44.973 --> 28:47.392
Have another glass of wine, huh?

28:49.978 --> 28:51.062
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

28:52.021 --> 28:53.606
(laughing) Niagara Falls.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.820
-Wouldn't want Joey to see that, would we?
-You know what I say?

28:59.571 --> 29:02.031
Let's blow this pop stand,
take a little ride.

29:02.115 --> 29:04.075
Yeah, let's get some air.
What do you say, Mick?

29:04.659 --> 29:06.286
We got a special treat for you now.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.955
-(groans)
-Come on, guy. Cheer up, huh?

29:09.873 --> 29:12.625
You can give me a yes or a no.
You moving in there or what?

29:12.709 --> 29:14.210
There's a lot to work out, babe,

29:14.294 --> 29:16.129
with Kenny and everything.
It's a big step.

29:16.212 --> 29:17.422
-You want my opinion?
-No.

29:17.505 --> 29:20.550
My opinion is this whole setup
is perfect for a guy like you.

29:20.633 --> 29:22.844
-What's that supposed to mean?
-It means you love it.

29:22.927 --> 29:25.638
You love stepping in,
being responsible, all out of proportion.

29:25.722 --> 29:29.434
-You think I'm in over my head?
-Hey, it's not for everybody.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.269
Neal, you're thriving.

29:31.352 --> 29:33.396
Since you started getting it
on a regular basis,

29:33.480 --> 29:36.107
-you've been a dream to work with.
-Hey, thanks a lot, J.D.

29:36.191 --> 29:39.152
Hey, Neal, I think we're being
a little sensitive here.

29:39.235 --> 29:41.279
Neal, J.D.!

29:41.362 --> 29:44.032
Don't forget you guys got
the Walker homicide tonight.

29:44.115 --> 29:47.702
-Not tonight, Lieutenant, I can't, man.
-You got grand jury Wednesday.

29:47.786 --> 29:51.539
-You knew about this.
-Oh, man, I completely forgot!

29:52.081 --> 29:53.917
-Lynnetta's gonna kill me.
-So, big deal.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.919
Tell her you'll make it up
to her this weekend.

29:56.002 --> 29:58.880
You don't understand.
Her mother's coming to dinner tonight.

29:58.963 --> 30:00.298
-Her mother?
-Her mother.

30:00.381 --> 30:03.384
You know, maybe working tonight
is not the worst thing in the world.

30:03.468 --> 30:04.719
It's been my experience--

30:04.803 --> 30:06.638
I got to get over there
and explain it to her.

30:06.721 --> 30:10.433
Are you kidding? The telephone
was invented for situations like this.

30:10.517 --> 30:11.851
-Use it.
-I'm taking an hour.

30:11.935 --> 30:13.520
-Cover for me, all right?
-(sighs)

30:13.603 --> 30:16.397
Your Honor, the state's without
a complainant on the robbery.

30:16.481 --> 30:18.733
And for the resisting, as you can see,

30:18.817 --> 30:21.152
if you compare the extent
of Mr. Morrison's injuries,

30:21.236 --> 30:23.238
he looks like he's been through a buzzsaw.

30:23.321 --> 30:26.324
Whereas Lieutenant Buntz is
complaining about a toothache.

30:27.450 --> 30:28.576
Counsel, approach.

30:32.330 --> 30:33.873
Irwin, is your man in a foul temper

30:33.957 --> 30:35.458
because of dental miseries?

30:35.542 --> 30:39.087
IRWIN: Defendant's sheet is just in.
It shows 11 priors.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.464
-What the hell is this?
-What's going on here?

30:41.548 --> 30:44.801
-Tell this creep to stay away from me.
-Legal Aide Society, Your Honor.

30:44.884 --> 30:46.219
On behalf of the P.D.'s office,

30:46.302 --> 30:48.346
we're serving Lieutenant Buntz
with a civil suit,

30:48.429 --> 30:51.808
100,000 unspecified damages,
400,000 against the city.

30:51.891 --> 30:53.518
You got to be off your nut.

30:53.601 --> 30:55.895
100 G's, rat face. I love it.

30:55.979 --> 30:58.523
-You heard it. We're gonna bury--
-That's enough, Mr. Morrison!

30:58.606 --> 31:00.358
People, can we settle this
with a disorderly?

31:00.441 --> 31:01.943
IRWIN: May we confer, Your Honor?

31:02.026 --> 31:04.237
-No way. They're bluffing.
-I know they are,

31:04.320 --> 31:06.072
but it's gonna take
a lawyer from my office

31:06.155 --> 31:07.448
30 man-hours to sort it out.

31:07.532 --> 31:09.242
-So, what are you saying?
-We go with it.

31:09.325 --> 31:11.369
-Don't I got anything to say here?
-No.

31:11.452 --> 31:13.079
-JUDGE: People?
-Acceptable, Your Honor.

31:13.162 --> 31:14.455
Reduced to disorderly conduct.

31:14.539 --> 31:17.542
-We'll plead to that.
-Plea accepted. Released on time served.

31:17.625 --> 31:19.836
-Arraignment waved. Bailiff, next case.
-(gavel bangs)

31:19.919 --> 31:24.048
BAILIFF: Docket number C-1-0-7-1-0-3,
Carmelo Gomez, vagrancy.

31:24.632 --> 31:26.926
So when do you figure I can
get my hands on the money?

31:27.010 --> 31:30.346
Mr. Morrison, I've explained
all of that to you already five times.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.432
You get nothing. The move was strategic.

31:32.515 --> 31:34.392
Suppose I guarantee you get half?

31:34.475 --> 31:36.394
Half of zero is zero, Mr. Morrison.

31:36.477 --> 31:37.979
Do you understand?

31:38.062 --> 31:40.148
Hey, look who it is, the hero himself.

31:40.231 --> 31:41.566
I'll be looking for you, ace.

31:41.649 --> 31:43.484
My client's been cleared on all charges.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.904
Steer clear of him,
or we'll be after you on harassment.

31:45.987 --> 31:46.988
Hey, no problem.

31:47.071 --> 31:49.157
That's right, hero,
I'm a free citizen now.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.325
You never know, Wendell.

31:50.408 --> 31:53.453
Real ugly tie, Buntz. Loser's tie!

31:56.623 --> 31:59.250
Neal, what are you doing here?

31:59.334 --> 32:00.668
Hey, baby. How are you doing?

32:00.752 --> 32:03.004
I stopped by the restaurant.
He told me you left early.

32:03.087 --> 32:04.380
Yeah, I know it sounds silly,

32:04.464 --> 32:06.341
but I got so nervous about this evening

32:06.424 --> 32:08.134
I couldn't stay around there any longer.

32:08.217 --> 32:10.261
I came home to set my own table.

32:10.345 --> 32:12.722
-Do you like it?
-Yeah, it looks beautiful.

32:12.805 --> 32:15.558
I'm glad you like it,
and I'm glad you stopped by.

32:15.642 --> 32:17.268
You know, you do terrible things to me.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.520
-Hey, look, baby, I came by to tell--
-I know.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.230
I got something else I want to show you.

32:21.314 --> 32:23.816
-Hey, look, look--
-Come on, Neal, no, don't even talk.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.485
Just come here. Come here, baby.

32:25.568 --> 32:27.028
Officer!

32:27.779 --> 32:29.822
(horn honking)

32:29.906 --> 32:31.282
Made any headway at all yet?

32:31.366 --> 32:33.284
Man, he's messed these wires all up.

32:33.368 --> 32:35.328
If I could get over into
the base of that statue,

32:35.411 --> 32:37.789
-I think I could unscramble it.
-What's keeping you?

32:37.872 --> 32:39.999
Hey, he might blast me with that hose.

32:40.083 --> 32:42.293
I got out of the sewage
business ten years ago.

32:42.377 --> 32:44.796
It's just a little bit of water.
It's not gonna kill you.

32:44.879 --> 32:47.632
I'm gonna take you over there.
We're gonna do it. Let's go.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.260
Hey, I'm putting in
for hazard pay on this.

32:51.844 --> 32:52.762
Mr. Castro!

32:52.845 --> 32:55.390
Hey, don't go that diplomacy route, Jack!

32:55.473 --> 32:57.976
Because I ain't moving
and neither is Kataz.

32:58.059 --> 33:00.436
We're here for all eternity!

33:00.520 --> 33:04.691
Look, I've been talking to Mr. Dunne here,
and he thinks we can work this thing out.

33:04.774 --> 33:06.484
-Mm-hmm.
-You just come down from there.

33:06.567 --> 33:08.778
We'll take your statue
and move it someplace else.

33:08.861 --> 33:09.904
Right, right.

33:09.988 --> 33:13.199
Now, that dozer don't look
like no moving van to me!

33:14.409 --> 33:17.245
Look, the most important thing
is that nobody gets hurt, right?

33:17.328 --> 33:21.457
Wrong! The important thing
is Kataz don't get hurt!

33:21.541 --> 33:23.668
Kataz will be a beacon

33:23.751 --> 33:25.878
for the brothers
that live among the stars!

33:25.962 --> 33:27.922
-(crowd cheers)
-A gusher of hope!

33:28.006 --> 33:30.174
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh!

33:30.258 --> 33:31.676
Hey, take it back up!

33:31.759 --> 33:32.969
Take it back up! Hurry!

33:34.303 --> 33:35.596
Come on! Up, up, up!

33:35.680 --> 33:38.599
-(metal creaking)
-Oh!

33:39.517 --> 33:40.977
All right, just take it easy.

33:41.644 --> 33:43.646
(groaning)

33:52.822 --> 33:56.117
All right, just put your weight on me on.
Take it easy. It's okay.

34:00.163 --> 34:02.665
Leave it be! Leave it be!

34:06.544 --> 34:09.630
-Take it easy.
-(groaning)

34:09.714 --> 34:12.842
-Ohh!
-(metal creaking)

34:12.925 --> 34:14.761
No!

34:15.553 --> 34:16.846
Beautiful, huh, Mick?

34:17.472 --> 34:18.681
Yeah, I guess.

34:19.640 --> 34:21.309
In the eyes of the beholder.

34:23.227 --> 34:26.189
After all you've been through,
I don't guess anything looks

34:26.272 --> 34:27.732
beautiful anymore.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.109
All the people you've hurt.

34:31.319 --> 34:32.403
Pain.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.490
Some people's lives are just endless pain.

34:37.283 --> 34:39.452
But it doesn't have to be that way, Mick.

34:39.535 --> 34:40.912
Look at the sky.

34:41.662 --> 34:43.873
One step, and you're outside it.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.583
No more hustling.

34:45.666 --> 34:47.335
No more guilt.

34:47.418 --> 34:50.546
You see, Mick, we have so much.
We want to share something.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.715
We helped Larry do it.

34:52.799 --> 34:54.467
Just like we want to help you.

34:54.550 --> 34:56.344
Okay, let go of me, then!

34:56.427 --> 34:58.179
I want to do this myself!

34:59.222 --> 35:00.431
It's golden, Mick.

35:05.144 --> 35:08.397
(growling)

35:08.481 --> 35:11.526
Police! Freeze!
You punks are under arrest!

35:11.609 --> 35:14.153
-Come on! Come on!
-Hey, take it easy, man!

35:14.237 --> 35:15.863
You slime bags.

35:16.572 --> 35:17.990
You wanted to get me drunk, right?

35:18.074 --> 35:20.076
Well, you got it! I'm real drunk!

35:20.159 --> 35:22.036
You can't do this. You got to take us in.

35:22.703 --> 35:24.080
I don't think so.

35:24.163 --> 35:26.791
I think if I take you in,
you'll hire some hotshot lawyer.

35:26.874 --> 35:28.584
Then both of you will walk,

35:28.668 --> 35:30.586
and that's just not gonna cut it.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.880
You want us to confess? We'll confess.

35:32.964 --> 35:35.174
Okay, Larry was with us, okay?

35:35.925 --> 35:37.760
This isn't about confessing.

35:38.594 --> 35:40.012
Turn around, both of you.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.056
Move!

35:42.140 --> 35:43.391
What are you gonna do?

35:44.308 --> 35:46.519
You can't do this, man! You're a cop!

35:47.895 --> 35:49.397
Take your coats and shoes off.

35:51.899 --> 35:52.984
Do it!

35:55.486 --> 35:58.322
See down there? That's Fulton Street.

35:59.115 --> 36:01.784
My old man was a tailor down
there all his life.

36:03.870 --> 36:06.622
A crummy little shop, never had two dimes,

36:06.706 --> 36:09.167
but he was a man because he had a heart.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.836
And you two pieces of garbage
have everything,

36:11.919 --> 36:13.462
but that isn't enough, is it?

36:15.423 --> 36:16.591
Take your shoes off.

36:17.341 --> 36:18.467
Take your shoes off!

36:28.227 --> 36:30.271
Now drop them over. Go on!

36:37.361 --> 36:38.779
I didn't want to.

36:39.530 --> 36:41.574
I never wanted to. He made me!

36:41.657 --> 36:42.950
Lie down on your stomachs.

36:43.826 --> 36:44.827
Move!

36:48.956 --> 36:50.374
Stick your head over the edge.

36:53.544 --> 36:56.380
Put your hands behind your back.
You're busted.

36:59.884 --> 37:02.220
Oh, boy! That was wonderful!

37:02.303 --> 37:03.596
Mm-hmm.

37:03.679 --> 37:05.097
Oh, didn't I please you?

37:05.181 --> 37:06.557
Of course you did, baby.

37:06.641 --> 37:08.142
Neal, what's wrong?

37:08.226 --> 37:10.102
Look, baby, I got to tell you something.

37:10.186 --> 37:11.437
I can't make dinner tonight.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.439
-You what?
-Look, I'm sorry, really.

37:13.522 --> 37:15.274
I just pulled night duty on a homicide.

37:15.358 --> 37:18.236
You knew all day.
You knew it this morning, didn't you?

37:18.319 --> 37:20.529
I'm sorry, honey.
It completely slipped my mind.

37:20.613 --> 37:21.697
You know I want to be here.

37:21.781 --> 37:24.242
LYNNETTA: You think you can
smooth things over, don't you?

37:24.325 --> 37:26.619
Neal, you're a user.
Come in here any time you want to,

37:26.702 --> 37:28.162
make love to me, and then walk out?

37:28.246 --> 37:29.664
NEAL: Come on, baby.
You know that's now true.

37:29.747 --> 37:32.124
I told you two weeks ago I'd move in,
but you got nervous.

37:32.208 --> 37:34.669
Yeah, I got nervous,
because who can depend on you?

37:37.421 --> 37:40.925
Neal, either you come to dinner tonight,

37:42.593 --> 37:44.720
or we're through, I mean it.
I can't live like this.

37:44.804 --> 37:47.139
Hey, baby, I already told you
there's nothing I can do.

37:47.223 --> 37:49.392
I tried to get out of it, but I can't.

37:49.475 --> 37:51.269
Using me like this.

37:51.352 --> 37:53.104
I hate it. I hate it.

37:53.187 --> 37:55.356
I hate it, Neal, and I hate you for it!

37:55.439 --> 37:57.817
Look, I tried to tell you,
but you didn't give me a chance!

37:57.900 --> 37:59.402
Oh, when? When did you try to tell me?

37:59.485 --> 38:01.612
I told you I can't get out of it!
I tried, but I can't!

38:01.696 --> 38:03.572
You knew this morning!
You knew all day long!

38:03.656 --> 38:06.826
I didn't know nothing!
It slipped my mind! Baby, I'm telling you!

38:06.909 --> 38:09.078
Using me all the time! I hate it!

38:09.161 --> 38:11.289
Just get out! Get out of my home!

38:11.372 --> 38:13.374
-Just get out of my home!
-Get out of your home?

38:13.457 --> 38:14.875
-Your home?
-Yeah!

38:14.959 --> 38:16.794
That's fine! That's fine with me!

38:16.877 --> 38:19.964
You want me out? I'll get the hell out!
I can't breathe around here anyway!

38:20.047 --> 38:24.218
I'm warning you once, girl!
If I leave here, I ain't coming back!

38:24.302 --> 38:25.636
Move in with some ditsy chick--

38:25.720 --> 38:27.305
-(gunshot)
-(groans)

38:27.388 --> 38:29.098
-Kenny!
-(gasping)

38:29.181 --> 38:30.433
Kenny!

38:31.809 --> 38:32.893
Oh, God!

38:33.519 --> 38:34.603
Oh, God!

38:35.521 --> 38:36.647
(gasping) 9-1-1!

38:37.440 --> 38:39.108
Hurry! Hurry!

38:39.191 --> 38:40.609
(moans)

38:45.197 --> 38:47.658
Captain, how's Neal?

38:47.742 --> 38:50.161
-He's in surgery now.
-He's gonna be okay, though, right?

38:50.244 --> 38:52.621
He was shot at close range, J.D.,
he's lost a lot of blood.

38:52.705 --> 38:54.665
-Anything?
-We should have something soon.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.667
Damn doctors! Man, he better be all right!

38:56.751 --> 38:59.378
-That's enough, J.D.
-What about that kid? They found him yet?

38:59.462 --> 39:01.922
-No yet, J.D.
-This is nuts.

39:02.006 --> 39:04.175
We've been through
a 1,000 scrapes together.

39:04.258 --> 39:05.718
He gets it from Kenny.

39:06.385 --> 39:08.137
I told him, "Use the phone."

39:11.724 --> 39:14.435
No, I'm not a member
of the immediate family.

39:14.518 --> 39:15.770
I work with him.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.897
I want to talk to Dr. Moss, please.

39:17.980 --> 39:21.108
And if he's not available,
would you page Captain Furillo

39:21.192 --> 39:23.569
or Lieutenant Goldblume
for me again, please?

39:23.652 --> 39:24.862
No, no, I'll hold.

39:25.571 --> 39:27.490
The surgery's taking forever.

39:27.573 --> 39:30.659
To think that such wickedness
should come from a child

39:30.743 --> 39:33.662
when we cherish such
sentimental notions about them.

39:33.746 --> 39:37.875
When in reality they are often
mere Hobbesian savages

39:37.958 --> 39:40.628
capable of stunning, stunning cruelty.

39:40.711 --> 39:43.089
You got it. Kids are up
for anything these days.

39:43.172 --> 39:44.173
Wait a minute.

39:44.256 --> 39:46.258
I don't think we have
all the facts on the table here.

39:46.342 --> 39:48.344
We don't really know
what went on in that house.

39:49.345 --> 39:52.181
The next thing you're gonna say
it was Neal's fault that he got shot.

39:52.264 --> 39:54.058
Don't simplify what I'm saying, okay?

39:54.141 --> 39:57.478
-Is there anything, Stan?
-Not yet. They got me on Muzak.

39:57.561 --> 39:59.063
-Lieutenant Buntz.
-Hmm?

39:59.146 --> 40:02.066
We have a robbery at 114th and Fulton.

40:02.149 --> 40:04.276
Officer Purnell said
you'd want to be notified.

40:04.360 --> 40:07.321
The perp was wearing a sweatshirt
that said "napalm daddy."

40:07.405 --> 40:10.199
-Got it. Let me know about Washington.
-Right, Lieutenant.

40:10.282 --> 40:12.368
-As soon as I hear something.
-I can't stand this!

40:12.993 --> 40:14.662
Come on. Just hang in there, all right?

40:14.745 --> 40:16.705
-(telephone rings)
-Hill Street.

40:17.998 --> 40:19.083
It's J.D.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.129
He's out of surgery. He's gonna make it.

40:23.212 --> 40:24.922
All right! All right, Neal!

40:25.005 --> 40:26.674
I told you the guy was tough!

40:26.757 --> 40:28.008
I told you he was tough!

40:28.092 --> 40:30.219
(laughter)

40:30.302 --> 40:33.681
(siren wailing)

40:35.641 --> 40:38.602
Come on! Look out! Move!

40:38.686 --> 40:39.728
What do you got?

40:39.812 --> 40:42.648
-It looks like your guy, Lieutenant.
-"Napalm daddy"? That's him.

40:42.731 --> 40:44.567
This is one mean dude. Look at this.

40:44.650 --> 40:46.610
The guy's face looks like a golf course.

40:46.694 --> 40:48.112
He used that on the old man?

40:48.195 --> 40:51.115
-The guy was slow pulling out the till.
-Anybody see which way he went?

40:51.198 --> 40:53.159
MAN: The stock boy said he headed
east down Clinton.

40:53.242 --> 40:55.661
I'm heading east on Clinton!
That germ's mine!

40:58.456 --> 40:59.665
An experiential--

41:00.624 --> 41:03.711
Renko, I'm just trying to
understand what you said. That's all.

41:03.794 --> 41:07.047
Now you said that she told you
you had to count backwards

41:07.131 --> 41:09.592
and then look at some
swinging pendulum, right?

41:09.675 --> 41:12.011
-Crystal, right.
-Well, I'm no expert, pal,

41:12.094 --> 41:14.096
but it sounds like you were hypnotized.

41:14.180 --> 41:17.141
Bobby, I tell you I had
my wits about me at all times.

41:17.224 --> 41:21.312
First, I saw myself
as a centurion in ancient Rome,

41:21.395 --> 41:24.231
and then as a foot soldier
marching to the Crusades,

41:24.315 --> 41:25.858
and I seen myself as a cavalryman

41:25.941 --> 41:27.443
with George Armstrong Custer.

41:27.526 --> 41:28.986
It's obvious.

41:29.069 --> 41:32.198
Renko, you are the eternal foot soldier.

41:32.281 --> 41:36.160
Every time you are reborn, you're a grunt.

41:36.243 --> 41:37.620
Oh, Lord.

41:37.703 --> 41:40.915
That must mean I'm meant
to be working as a cop

41:40.998 --> 41:42.500
for all eternity.

41:42.583 --> 41:44.460
(laughing) I guess you're right.

41:44.543 --> 41:45.794
Hey, but don't feel bad.

41:45.878 --> 41:47.546
Maybe in the next life

41:47.630 --> 41:50.299
you'll get yourself a battered,
old rocket ship,

41:50.382 --> 41:52.968
trying to catch muggers and rapists

41:53.052 --> 41:55.137
somewhere out in outer space.

41:55.221 --> 41:57.765
(laughs) That's terrible.

41:57.848 --> 41:59.225
We got to work..

41:59.308 --> 42:01.936
Bobby, look here. Look here.

42:03.020 --> 42:04.063
Stop here.

42:04.146 --> 42:08.442
(eerie music playing)

42:22.498 --> 42:23.457
Kenny.

42:24.708 --> 42:27.836
I've been practicing like Neal said to.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.630
You want to get the ball straight.

42:29.713 --> 42:31.507
Nice and easy.

42:35.094 --> 42:36.345
See?

42:38.556 --> 42:39.723
Let's go, son.

42:40.516 --> 42:42.851
I've been practicing a long time.

42:43.811 --> 42:45.729
I'll be getting good soon.

42:49.233 --> 42:52.486
(streetside chatter)

42:57.575 --> 42:58.492
(car door slams)

42:58.951 --> 43:00.578
(engine turns over)

43:04.290 --> 43:06.333
(engine turns over)

43:09.920 --> 43:12.715
(indistinct conversations)

43:17.261 --> 43:19.722
(dramatic music playing)

43:26.061 --> 43:27.688
LYNNETTA: Kenny!

43:28.814 --> 43:29.940
Come here, baby.

43:30.024 --> 43:32.610
-I shot Neal, Mommy.
-I know, baby.

43:32.693 --> 43:34.278
I know. I know.

43:34.361 --> 43:37.615
-I didn't want him to leave.
-I know.

43:43.662 --> 43:45.831
(indistinct radio chatter)

44:03.515 --> 44:05.434
(horn honks)

44:13.817 --> 44:15.736
Open the cash drawer! Move it!

44:17.988 --> 44:19.698
Wendell, police!

44:28.874 --> 44:30.959
You don't look so tough now, huh, kid?

44:31.710 --> 44:34.463
-(siren wails)
-Looks like a clean shoot, Captain.

44:34.546 --> 44:36.507
The night clerk said
the guy had his piece out

44:36.590 --> 44:38.926
-and gave the Lieutenant no choice.
-Thank you.

44:39.927 --> 44:40.928
Let's go.

44:41.762 --> 44:43.263
What were you doing here tonight?

44:43.347 --> 44:45.891
Well, how about this,
I went inside for an ice--

44:45.974 --> 44:47.559
I don't want crap. I want answers.

44:47.643 --> 44:50.437
-What were you doing here?
-I got a tip.

44:50.521 --> 44:53.190
When I got there the guy was
already inside casing the joint.

44:53.273 --> 44:55.651
Why didn't you try to arrest him
before he pulled his gun?

44:55.734 --> 44:57.569
Hey, what is this, dÃ©jÃ  vu?

44:57.653 --> 45:00.030
I thought we already went
through all that this morning.

45:00.823 --> 45:03.951
But this time you'd have
the candy store owner as a complainant.

45:04.034 --> 45:05.369
Funny thing.

45:05.452 --> 45:07.204
Anybody that "napalm daddy" visited

45:07.287 --> 45:09.248
gets a sudden case of lockjaw.

45:09.331 --> 45:11.750
I told him he was under arrest.
He didn't wanna go that way.

45:11.834 --> 45:13.752
Ask the kid if he didn't turn
his piece on me.

45:13.836 --> 45:16.130
Let's try another version.
You lost in court,

45:16.213 --> 45:18.882
you played out a personal vendetta,
and you executed him.

45:19.508 --> 45:21.218
That's a nice story. Try and sell it.

45:21.301 --> 45:24.596
-I.A.D.'s gonna clear me.
-Maybe, but you're not clear with me.

45:24.680 --> 45:25.764
I can live with it.

45:32.396 --> 45:34.148
-(clears throat)
-(engine turns over)

45:36.984 --> 45:38.277
(knock on door)

45:38.360 --> 45:40.320
Hey, man, what's going down?

45:40.404 --> 45:42.698
I was just here seeing a friend.
Thought I'd drop by.

45:42.781 --> 45:45.409
Yeah, I almost dropped by
this afternoon, huh?

45:46.034 --> 45:48.746
-Guess you saved my butt.
-Yeah, no problem.

45:49.455 --> 45:51.749
Sorry about spraying you
with that water, man.

45:51.832 --> 45:54.501
-Did I get busted for that?
-No, we're gonna let it slide.

45:54.585 --> 45:57.504
-(chuckles)
-So, uh, what is this?

45:57.588 --> 45:58.839
Oh, this is a new one.

45:59.548 --> 46:00.549
Ain't she a beaut?

46:02.718 --> 46:06.054
-Can I be frank?
-I expect nothing else.

46:06.138 --> 46:07.931
Well, to be perfectly honest,

46:08.015 --> 46:10.893
I think it looks like a phallic symbol.

46:11.602 --> 46:12.686
(chuckles)

46:12.770 --> 46:15.105
You got an eye for that after all, man.

46:15.939 --> 46:17.191
All right. Um...

46:17.858 --> 46:18.942
You take care, Bobby.

46:19.026 --> 46:20.027
Yeah.

46:20.694 --> 46:22.946
-I'll see you at my next opening?
-Maybe.

46:23.530 --> 46:25.741
Yeah? (chuckles)

46:25.824 --> 46:27.868
J.D., is that you?

46:27.951 --> 46:31.038
(monitors beeping)

46:31.121 --> 46:33.832
No, man. It's Florence Nightingale.

46:33.916 --> 46:35.501
They found Kenny, right?

46:35.584 --> 46:37.294
Yeah, yeah, he was on a playground.

46:37.377 --> 46:38.921
He was shooting baskets.

46:40.088 --> 46:42.049
-Shooting baskets?
-Yeah.

46:42.132 --> 46:43.842
The kid's in juvie tonight.

46:44.843 --> 46:45.928
Lynnetta with him?

46:46.011 --> 46:48.096
Yeah, she was. Maybe she still is.

46:48.180 --> 46:52.768
You know, the whole time
while I was out there

46:52.851 --> 46:54.394
on that court with Kenny today,

46:55.521 --> 46:57.856
I was thinking of myself as a kid.

46:59.191 --> 47:00.359
When I was young,

47:01.276 --> 47:03.195
I could play some ball.

47:03.278 --> 47:06.698
Man, I lived for that court.

47:06.782 --> 47:10.452
The whole day in school
I'd just think about it.

47:11.119 --> 47:12.371
When it got dark,

47:13.205 --> 47:16.291
I'd find me another basket
near a streetlight.

47:16.375 --> 47:18.126
I never wanted to go home.

47:18.210 --> 47:19.753
My old man would be there,

47:20.838 --> 47:23.632
drunk and cursing me.

47:25.092 --> 47:28.971
As long as I could keep shooting baskets,
I was all right.

47:29.054 --> 47:30.013
I was all right.

47:30.764 --> 47:32.599
Just keeps going around, don't it?

47:33.517 --> 47:35.727
One generation after another.

47:36.562 --> 47:39.481
Just keeps going.
J.D., J.D.! You there, man?

47:39.565 --> 47:41.567
Yeah, man. Yeah. Shh! I'm here, man.

47:41.650 --> 47:43.026
Shh. Shh.

47:43.110 --> 47:45.237
Go on back to sleep. Go on.

47:48.365 --> 47:49.366
(sighs)

47:59.710 --> 48:03.505
(theme music playing)
