WEBVTT

00:02.669 --> 00:08.050
SAM: <i>A few months ago, billions of people</i>
<i>reappeared after five years away.</i>

00:09.968 --> 00:12.262
<i>We need new heroes.</i>

00:13.555 --> 00:15.641
<i>Ones suited for the times we're in.</i>

00:17.851 --> 00:22.272
<i>Symbols are nothing without</i>
<i>the women and men that give them meaning.</i>

00:25.859 --> 00:29.321
<i>And this thing, I don't know</i>
<i>if there's ever been a greater symbol.</i>

00:32.699 --> 00:34.952
<i>But it's more about the man</i>
<i>who propped it up,</i>

00:36.495 --> 00:37.496
<i>and he's gone.</i>

00:40.123 --> 00:44.336
<i>So, today we honor Steve's legacy.</i>
<i>But also, we look to the future...</i>

00:46.880 --> 00:48.632
<i>and the fights that await us there.</i>

00:53.470 --> 00:56.431
When Disney Plus was announced,
we realized there was an opportunity

00:56.515 --> 00:59.309
to interweave a cinematic universe
with the television universe,

00:59.393 --> 01:01.186
which had never been done before.

01:01.270 --> 01:04.189
<i>We knew if we could nail it,</i>
<i>that's what would make this unique.</i>

01:04.773 --> 01:06.733
<i>These characters can continue</i>
<i>to be developed</i>

01:06.817 --> 01:10.070
<i>in a way that we oftentimes</i>
<i>don't have time to do in films</i>

01:10.153 --> 01:12.739
and then launch right back
into that feature universe,

01:12.823 --> 01:16.118
<i>so that it's truly connected</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

01:27.212 --> 01:29.840
ZOIE NAGELHOUT: <i>I think</i>
<i>for Nate and I, it was very obvious</i>

01:29.923 --> 01:32.426
that <i>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</i>
would be

01:32.509 --> 01:34.636
the perfect thing for this kind of format.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.806
FALCON: <i>Look at you.</i>
<i>All stealthy.</i> (CHUCKLES)

01:37.890 --> 01:40.517
A little time in Wakanda
and you come out White Panther.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.395
-It's actually White Wolf.
-Huh?

01:43.478 --> 01:47.191
NAGELHOUT: <i>With, quite frankly, not a ton</i>
<i>of screen time throughout the movies,</i>

01:47.274 --> 01:48.650
they have become beloved.

01:48.734 --> 01:50.319
What the hell is that?

01:50.402 --> 01:52.279
Everyone's got a gimmick now.

01:52.362 --> 01:55.199
NAGELHOUT: <i>And with the little bit of time</i>
<i>they've interacted,</i>

01:55.282 --> 01:58.702
have sort of created this
interesting buddy-cop tumultuous dynamic

01:58.785 --> 02:00.412
that was so worth exploring.

02:00.495 --> 02:01.872
Can you move your seat up?

02:01.955 --> 02:02.956
No.

02:04.374 --> 02:07.503
From the outset,
the goal was to be very grounded.

02:08.629 --> 02:11.507
Endgame <i>was the battle of the titans</i>

02:11.590 --> 02:15.093
<i>in a universe that was</i>
<i>from a stellar place.</i>

02:15.177 --> 02:18.680
So, the swing of the bat here
was to bring all of that

02:18.764 --> 02:24.311
<i>into a very relatable,</i>
<i>very grounded character place,</i>

02:24.394 --> 02:30.192
<i>so that really the super side of it</i>
<i>became embedded in character.</i>

02:30.275 --> 02:32.778
But it was also embedded
in a very real world.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.989
This is a moment
where you really could drop it all.

02:36.073 --> 02:38.450
And we should feel
like that's going through your mind.

02:38.534 --> 02:40.786
-ERIN KELLYMAN: Mmm-hmm.
-And therefore he needs to tell her...

02:40.869 --> 02:43.413
You know, you're feeling, like,
"I might have her now,"

02:43.497 --> 02:45.374
and so you can relax your body.
And then boom.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.043
<i>So you kinda sucker punch him, right?</i>

02:48.126 --> 02:51.421
ANTHONY MACKIE: <i>Kari's been great.</i>
<i>I think once you see this series,</i>

02:51.505 --> 02:54.967
<i>you'll realize the emotional depth</i>
<i>of these characters.</i>

02:55.092 --> 02:58.136
It's more of a drama than anything else.

02:58.220 --> 03:02.641
<i>Kari was able to make us less macho</i>

03:02.724 --> 03:05.227
<i>and put machismo in the series</i>

03:05.310 --> 03:07.062
<i>with all the fighting and special effects</i>

03:07.145 --> 03:09.273
<i>-and explosions and all that stuff.</i>
-(SCREAMS)

03:09.857 --> 03:11.066
Not exactly a badass.

03:11.149 --> 03:12.442
-(MACKIE LAUGHS)
-What?

03:12.526 --> 03:14.653
MACKIE: <i>But also show</i>
<i>the emotional construct</i>

03:14.736 --> 03:16.697
that makes everyone an individual.

03:16.780 --> 03:19.825
SKOGLAND: <i>It was very important</i>
<i>to me, and I think to everybody</i>

03:19.908 --> 03:24.162
to explore what it means
to be a hero in today's world.

03:24.246 --> 03:26.665
<i>If in the past, in the MCU,</i>

03:26.748 --> 03:31.378
<i>being a hero was very much related</i>
<i>to being a soldier and being a warrior,</i>

03:31.461 --> 03:34.173
<i>the new hero is not that.</i>

03:34.256 --> 03:37.634
The new hero is really a first responder,

03:37.718 --> 03:41.889
<i>and so it was embedded</i>
<i>in our journey for both characters.</i>

03:41.972 --> 03:44.850
Walker! Help me!

03:44.933 --> 03:47.477
SEBASTIAN STAN: <i>I think she just saw this</i>

03:47.561 --> 03:50.856
as two regular guys
trying to find their way

03:50.939 --> 03:56.403
and the main thing that stood out to me
was this new kind of way of shooting

03:56.486 --> 04:00.240
<i>where she would capture</i>
<i>the characters' inner thoughts and so on.</i>

04:00.324 --> 04:02.075
And I thought that was really interesting.

04:02.159 --> 04:07.748
So, now that you've stopped fighting,
what do you want?

04:12.920 --> 04:14.213
Peace.

04:14.296 --> 04:15.839
That is utter bull...

04:18.467 --> 04:22.513
MALCOLM SPELLMAN: <i>As soon as you step into</i>
<i>the second floor of the Marvel building,</i>

04:22.596 --> 04:24.973
it really does make you feel like

04:25.057 --> 04:27.392
you've stepped into something
that's bigger than you.

04:29.102 --> 04:33.607
<i>Kevin and the rest of the Marvel team's</i>
<i>mandate of, "This cannot be TV,"</i>

04:33.690 --> 04:35.150
<i>it has to feel like a movie,</i>

04:35.234 --> 04:37.361
<i>but the storytelling</i>
<i>is inherently spread out.</i>

04:37.444 --> 04:40.280
<i>I felt particularly equipped to do that.</i>

04:40.364 --> 04:42.282
I always say,
"You break stories two ways."

04:42.366 --> 04:44.535
You break 'em vertically,
which is by each episode,

04:44.618 --> 04:45.911
then, horizontally.

04:45.994 --> 04:49.873
<i>And that horizontal break with</i>
<i>the characters and their relationships,</i>

04:50.624 --> 04:54.503
<i>every iteration of show we did,</i>
<i>that maintained and actually got stronger.</i>

04:54.628 --> 04:55.879
Enjoy your ride, Buck.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.881
No, no, no, no, you can't call me that.

04:58.006 --> 05:01.718
-Why? That's what Steve called you.
-Steve knew me longer and he had a plan.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.221
When we were talking
about the idea for the show,

05:04.304 --> 05:07.474
Malcolm Spellman said the thing
that resonated for him the most

05:07.558 --> 05:10.561
<i>with the end of</i> Endgame <i>was Sam's line,</i>

05:10.644 --> 05:14.106
<i>"It feels like it's someone else's,"</i>
<i>and the notion of legacy.</i>

05:14.189 --> 05:15.190
STEVE: How does it feel?

05:17.442 --> 05:18.986
Like it's someone else's.

05:19.111 --> 05:20.487
It isn't.

05:23.907 --> 05:24.908
(SIGHS)

05:24.992 --> 05:28.912
NAGELHOUT: <i>That line became sort of</i>
<i>the backbone of Sam's arc.</i>

05:28.996 --> 05:34.084
<i>And it was very clear to us that if we're</i>
<i>gonna tell a story over six hours,</i>

05:34.168 --> 05:39.089
we owe it to both that mantle
and that symbol and that character

05:39.173 --> 05:41.133
<i>to dissect it from every angle</i>

05:41.216 --> 05:45.304
<i>before he can arc</i>
<i>to a place where he's evolved.</i>

05:45.387 --> 05:51.518
I'd felt like we would be dishonest
to the fans and dishonest to,

05:51.602 --> 05:53.228
just on a human level,

05:53.312 --> 05:55.939
<i>if we had this Black man</i>
<i>just accept this symbol</i>

05:56.023 --> 05:58.317
<i>without having real ambivalence about it.</i>

05:58.400 --> 06:02.404
<i>And we knew that that was gonna be</i>
<i>crucial to Sam's burden.</i>

06:02.487 --> 06:03.864
As a Black man in America,

06:03.947 --> 06:06.700
to take on the stars and stripes
and wear that proudly,

06:06.783 --> 06:09.453
that's not something
that Sam Wilson would do out of the box.

06:09.536 --> 06:12.539
<i>The notion of exploring</i>
<i>what Blackness means in America</i>

06:12.623 --> 06:14.541
<i>was kind of the hypothesis of the show,</i>

06:14.625 --> 06:16.210
<i>and the notion of legacy was something</i>

06:16.293 --> 06:18.795
<i>that both Sam and Bucky,</i>
<i>in the show, explore.</i>

06:18.921 --> 06:23.217
Maybe this is something
you or Steve will never understand.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.888
But can you accept
that I did what I thought was right?

06:30.474 --> 06:32.267
MACKIE: <i>When you think Captain America,</i>

06:32.351 --> 06:35.354
<i>you think of</i>
<i>a very specific brand of person.</i>

06:35.437 --> 06:38.440
There are so many different lines,
so many different avenues,

06:38.524 --> 06:42.402
so many realities
that we have to live in every day

06:42.486 --> 06:45.405
to be a successful Black man
in our society.

06:45.489 --> 06:49.326
<i>You know, you can't be the same person</i>
<i>every room you walk in.</i>

06:49.409 --> 06:51.954
<i>It's a hard duality</i>
<i>that you have to live in</i>

06:52.037 --> 06:55.123
<i>and sometimes specifically,</i>
<i>for somebody like Sam,</i>

06:55.207 --> 06:58.168
<i>you have to ask yourself,</i>
<i>"Are you willing to deal with it?"</i>

06:58.752 --> 07:02.881
KID: Hey, it's Black Falcon. What's up?
SAM: It's just Falcon, kid.

07:02.965 --> 07:06.260
I mean, I think 2020 and COVID,
if nothing else,

07:06.343 --> 07:12.432
<i>have proven how difficult it is</i>
<i>to be a Black man in America.</i>

07:12.516 --> 07:16.895
It's not a new understanding or experience
for anybody Black.

07:16.979 --> 07:19.690
-Hey, is this guy bothering you?
-No, he's not bothering me.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.233
Do you know who this is?

07:21.316 --> 07:23.110
(WHISPERS) Hey, these guys are Avengers.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.531
Oh, God, I am so sorry, Mr. Wilson.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.492
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) I didn't
recognize you without the goggles.

07:30.576 --> 07:32.703
MACKIE: <i>With Sam picking up the shield,</i>

07:32.786 --> 07:37.457
<i>it's such a representation of</i>
<i>the country that we live in,</i>

07:37.541 --> 07:40.419
you know, there's a lot of trepidation

07:40.502 --> 07:46.717
as far as, "How does a Black man represent
a country that does not represent him?"

07:46.800 --> 07:50.429
SPELLMAN: <i>We knew the journey</i>
<i>that Sam was gonna go on</i>

07:50.512 --> 07:52.514
<i>was going to be particularly rough for him</i>

07:52.598 --> 07:56.685
<i>just because of the fact</i>
<i>that he is a Black superhero, right?</i>

07:56.768 --> 08:00.480
Well, Anthony's backstory
is rooted in Louisiana,

08:00.564 --> 08:04.193
<i>and we merged some of that so that</i>
<i>it could become really, really personal.</i>

08:04.276 --> 08:07.070
<i>Then they start telling you</i>
<i>what they've done with the characters,</i>

08:07.154 --> 08:09.031
and from that a whole life is born.

08:09.615 --> 08:11.617
I told you specifically
that the water pump

08:11.700 --> 08:14.119
was not the problem,
and yet, here you are.

08:14.203 --> 08:18.498
In our defense, we were supposed to
have this done way before you woke up.

08:18.582 --> 08:21.460
I don't come up to the sky to tell you
how to barrel roll or whatever,

08:21.543 --> 08:23.670
so you don't come down here
and start messing around with things

08:23.754 --> 08:25.589
-you clearly don't understand.
-Wow...

08:25.672 --> 08:29.343
MACKIE: <i>You know, Adepero came in and gave</i>
<i>an amazing performance as my sister</i>

08:29.426 --> 08:35.307
and really gave that character a backbone
that kind of defined the entire history

08:35.390 --> 08:40.646
of what this character, Sam Wilson,
really is from <i>Winter Soldier</i> till now.

08:40.729 --> 08:43.524
-I thought you said you're a pilot.
-I never said pilot.

08:43.607 --> 08:49.196
MACKIE: <i>You see how all of that became</i>
<i>this man from where he was from.</i>

08:49.279 --> 08:52.741
I've enjoyed learning
who Sam Wilson truly is.

08:52.824 --> 08:55.994
What would be the point
of all the pain and sacrifice

08:57.120 --> 08:59.456
if I wasn't willing to stand up
and keep fightin'?

09:00.749 --> 09:03.252
NAGELHOUT: <i>Sam's search for identity</i>
<i>is about his future</i>

09:03.335 --> 09:06.129
<i>and Bucky's search for identity</i>
<i>is about his past.</i>

09:06.213 --> 09:08.757
<i>And for Bucky, what we don't want to do</i>

09:08.841 --> 09:10.926
<i>is abandon ten years of storytelling.</i>

09:11.009 --> 09:13.929
It was really important that we tackle
those ten years of storytelling

09:14.012 --> 09:18.183
<i>and allow Bucky to process</i>
<i>the events of his life</i>

09:18.267 --> 09:21.562
in a way that he hasn't had time to
in the two hour stories

09:21.645 --> 09:23.021
that he's been a part of.

09:23.105 --> 09:24.773
MOORE: <i>When we were</i>
<i>making</i> First Avenger,

09:24.857 --> 09:27.150
<i>there are always ideas</i>
<i>of what could happen one day</i>

09:27.234 --> 09:29.444
<i>if we were so lucky to make a sequel.</i>

09:29.528 --> 09:31.947
You're trying
to get that movie right the first time.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.782
You're not sure where this will lead.

09:33.866 --> 09:39.246
Sergeant Barnes,
you are to be the new fist of HYDRA.

09:39.872 --> 09:43.041
MOORE: <i>We'd be lying to say we didn't talk</i>
<i>about where Bucky could go,</i>

09:43.125 --> 09:46.461
<i>but we didn't know how far we could</i>
<i>take him and where he might end up.</i>

09:46.545 --> 09:48.755
<i>When you see Sebastian</i>
<i>portraying the Winter Soldier,</i>

09:48.839 --> 09:51.425
which to us was even an extra level,

09:51.508 --> 09:53.510
we knew there was
something to explore there.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.596
-What did I do?
-Enough.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.556
Oh, God. I knew this would happen.

09:57.639 --> 10:00.017
Everything HYDRA
put inside me is still there.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.144
MOORE: <i>The relationship</i>
<i>between Bucky and Steve</i>

10:02.227 --> 10:05.022
<i>is so dramatic and so filled with pathos,</i>

10:05.105 --> 10:06.273
<i>if you think about it,</i>

10:06.356 --> 10:09.526
<i>the only person who had believed in Bucky</i>
<i>in the MCU up to this point</i>

10:09.610 --> 10:11.069
was Steve Rogers.

10:11.153 --> 10:12.613
Well, now Steve Rogers is gone.

10:12.696 --> 10:16.116
<i>Bucky feels unmoored in this series</i>
<i>and is looking for his purpose.</i>

10:16.200 --> 10:20.787
That shield's the closest thing
I've got left to a family.

10:22.623 --> 10:23.999
So when you retired it,

10:25.876 --> 10:28.003
it made me feel like I had nothing left.

10:28.086 --> 10:30.547
What was challenging for me
was the balance between

10:30.631 --> 10:32.925
<i>introducing the characters in a new way,</i>

10:33.008 --> 10:36.845
<i>and yet making you still be aware</i>
<i>of where they come from. You know?</i>

10:36.929 --> 10:40.098
<i>I always think with these movies,</i>
<i>every time I come back,</i>

10:40.182 --> 10:41.266
<i>I'm always thinking,</i>

10:41.350 --> 10:44.394
<i>"Okay, what if a fan sits down and watches</i>

10:44.478 --> 10:46.939
<i>Captain America: First Avenger,</i>
<i>Winter Soldier, Civil War,</i>

10:47.022 --> 10:48.690
<i>The Avengers,</i> now this,

10:48.774 --> 10:52.319
<i>are they gonna be able to see</i>
<i>that same character throughout,</i>

10:52.402 --> 10:55.989
and then see that character
evolve in new ways

10:56.073 --> 10:58.033
<i>but still be the same character?"</i>

10:58.116 --> 10:59.868
I am no longer the Winter Soldier.

10:59.952 --> 11:01.203
I'm James Bucky Barnes.

11:01.286 --> 11:04.164
And you're part of my efforts
to make amends.

11:05.916 --> 11:08.502
How does this character
now function in the world?

11:08.585 --> 11:10.587
<i>What's his life going back to Brooklyn?</i>

11:10.671 --> 11:13.715
<i>How is he meeting people?</i>
<i>How is he interacting at coffee shops?</i>

11:13.799 --> 11:16.677

17:16.078 --> 17:17.412
<i>for us to include in the series,</i>

<i>not only because of his connection</i>

Couldn't have planned it better myself.

21:54.022 --> 21:58.318
Maybe I did. No, I didn't.
I'm just kidding. Or am I?

21:58.402 --> 22:00.821
LOUIS-DREYFUS:
<i>I like the idea of a female mastermind.</i>

22:00.904 --> 22:02.656
<i>I think it's about time.</i>

22:02.739 --> 22:06.827
She's about three steps ahead of everyone.
And that's gobs of fun to play.

22:06.910 --> 22:09.830
Things are about to get very weird.

22:09.913 --> 22:14.168
And, you know, when they do,
we're not gonna need a Captain America.

22:14.251 --> 22:15.252
WALKER: No.

22:16.044 --> 22:17.588
You know what we're gonna need?

22:20.048 --> 22:22.009
A U.S. Agent.

22:22.843 --> 22:25.387
How do you want the rest
of this conversation to go, Sam, huh?

22:27.764 --> 22:28.849
Yeah. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

22:28.932 --> 22:30.350
Should I put down the shield?

22:30.434 --> 22:32.019
-Make it fair?
-(SCOFFS)

22:38.233 --> 22:41.195
So, we're on Zemo's apartment set,

22:41.278 --> 22:44.531
which we built specifically for Zemo,

22:44.615 --> 22:48.911
also to accommodate a big fight sequence
that we do in here when the Dora show up.

22:50.287 --> 22:51.288
(WALKER GRUNTING)

22:51.371 --> 22:53.790
BRAD MARTIN: <i>We started off</i>
<i>training our actors here.</i>

22:53.874 --> 22:56.835
They do as much as they can,
they learn as much as they can,

22:56.919 --> 22:59.087
<i>and perform as much</i>
<i>as they're able to on camera,</i>

22:59.171 --> 23:02.925
and that's what everybody wants to see,
our actors, our heroes doing the action.

23:03.008 --> 23:06.094
All right, so that's where you stab.
And then I'll count you in.

23:07.221 --> 23:09.223
<i>And three, two, one, stab.</i>

23:09.306 --> 23:12.976
It's an organic hand-to-hand combat,
but they got those spears, man.

23:13.060 --> 23:17.189
<i>When you're choreographing the fight scene</i>
<i>with spears, you can't fake.</i>

23:17.272 --> 23:20.359
A spear is a spear. You're gonna...
(LAUGHS) You know what I'm sayin'?

23:20.442 --> 23:22.653
MARTIN: <i>Working with the Marvel actors</i>

23:22.736 --> 23:25.489
<i>that have done these characters</i>
<i>makes things way easier.</i>

23:25.572 --> 23:28.408
<i>They know the deal. They know</i>
<i>what their characters do in general.</i>

23:28.492 --> 23:30.494
MACKIE: (GROANS) Oh, God.

23:30.577 --> 23:32.246
In terms of the ease and efficiency,

23:32.329 --> 23:34.540
working on a set than working on a stage

23:34.623 --> 23:37.626
<i>is always easier, always faster,</i>
<i>always more controllable.</i>

23:37.709 --> 23:39.837
<i>-That's what you need to do.</i>
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

23:39.920 --> 23:43.173
<i>You need to control all the elements</i>
<i>when you're making big action.</i>

23:46.051 --> 23:49.805
So we had three of the Dora,
we had all of our guys.

23:49.888 --> 23:52.599
<i>The room was filled with our characters.</i>

23:52.683 --> 23:54.852
<i>And then everybody</i>
<i>is smashing everybody else.</i>

23:54.935 --> 23:56.645
(CHUCKLES) So it was a lot of fun.

23:56.728 --> 23:59.356
(BOTH GRUNTING)

24:09.324 --> 24:11.201
Bast damn you, James.

24:12.619 --> 24:15.789
NAGELHOUT: <i>It was, in my opinion,</i>
<i>a complete no-brainer</i>

24:15.873 --> 24:16.999
<i>to include the Wakandans.</i>

24:17.082 --> 24:20.586
I mean, Florence Kasumba is just a force.

24:22.462 --> 24:28.385
Any time I get to play Ayo,
it's always like a Christmas present.

24:29.052 --> 24:33.682
<i>Because it actually doesn't really matter</i>
<i>where I would have to work.</i>

24:33.765 --> 24:35.309
<i>I'm always excited.</i>

24:35.392 --> 24:37.352
<i>Most of the time,</i>
<i>when I get the phone call,</i>

24:37.436 --> 24:38.854
<i>I don't even know the story.</i>

24:38.937 --> 24:40.898
<i>I only know</i>
<i>that I will play the character,</i>

24:40.981 --> 24:43.108
<i>but I don't really know what's happening.</i>

24:43.192 --> 24:46.862
And, like the audience, I'm excited
'cause I have no idea.

24:46.945 --> 24:49.239
I will have to read the books and train.

24:49.323 --> 24:52.701
<i>I just got used to the fact that</i>
<i>when I get the phone call,</i>

24:52.784 --> 24:54.578
<i>I will always be ready to function,</i>

24:54.661 --> 24:56.288
<i>because I train the whole year,</i>

24:56.371 --> 25:00.000
<i>and am in contact with the other women,</i>
<i>for example, who played the Dora Milaje.</i>

25:00.083 --> 25:04.254
And we exchange, and everybody
still continues doing other projects.

25:04.338 --> 25:08.967
<i>But at the end of the day, the minute</i>
<i>you put on the armor and the costume,</i>

25:09.051 --> 25:10.928
you become the character,

25:11.011 --> 25:12.429
and that just feels like home.

25:12.513 --> 25:14.806
I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

25:16.141 --> 25:17.142
(SPEAKING WAKANDAN)

25:17.809 --> 25:20.687
NAGELHOUT: <i>It was really important,</i>
<i>specifically to Kari</i>

25:20.771 --> 25:23.857
<i>and to the rest of us as well,</i>
<i>that the actors have an opportunity</i>

25:23.941 --> 25:27.361
to feel the location
and to be there in real life.

25:27.444 --> 25:29.947
We had planned to go to Puerto Rico
for part of the shoot,

25:30.030 --> 25:33.784
to give the show a bit more scope
because we were based out of Atlanta.

25:33.867 --> 25:36.245
<i>And, unfortunately,</i>
<i>Puerto Rico went through</i>

25:36.328 --> 25:39.623
<i>quite a sizeable earthquake</i>
<i>that really damaged their infrastructure.</i>

25:39.706 --> 25:43.752
<i>Our plan was still to go to Puerto Rico</i>
<i>even after the first earthquake</i>

25:43.836 --> 25:47.172
<i>because we had done a ton of research</i>
<i>as to the seismic activity in the area.</i>

25:47.256 --> 25:50.843
<i>We knew we could get our crews</i>
<i>in and out quickly if we had to.</i>

25:50.926 --> 25:54.805
And, frankly, in talking with the experts,
even I was comfortable saying,

25:54.888 --> 25:57.140
"Yeah, I'll go. I'll go with the crew."

25:57.224 --> 26:01.311
Because, to me, if I'm willing to go,
that means something.

26:01.395 --> 26:03.939
If I'm not willing to go,
but I'm gonna send other people,

26:04.064 --> 26:05.774
that's not a choice we should be making.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.735
<i>We had prepped the crew</i>
<i>to go to Puerto Rico</i>

26:08.819 --> 26:10.487
<i>in spite of the first earthquake,</i>

26:10.571 --> 26:13.031
<i>and on the eve of going,</i>
<i>they had a second earthquake.</i>

26:13.115 --> 26:15.534
It came to the point where,
between all of us,

26:15.617 --> 26:18.120
we weren't comfortable
sending anybody down there

26:18.203 --> 26:21.456
and we wanted to bring our crew home
because we just didn't know.

26:21.540 --> 26:24.168
<i>So, we brought everybody back.</i>

26:24.251 --> 26:27.254
<i>Right as we brought everybody back,</i>

26:27.337 --> 26:29.673
<i>we regrouped, said "Where can we go now?"</i>

26:29.756 --> 26:31.216
<i>We had planned Prague,</i>

26:31.300 --> 26:33.177
<i>moved it to the end of the schedule</i>

26:33.260 --> 26:35.846
<i>to replace the work</i>
<i>we were gonna do in Puerto Rico.</i>

26:35.929 --> 26:37.973
NAGELHOUT: <i>We actually made it to Prague.</i>

26:38.056 --> 26:40.475
<i>We pulled off</i>
<i>what seemed to be the impossible.</i>

26:40.559 --> 26:41.935
<i>We were having a great shoot,</i>

26:42.019 --> 26:46.064
<i>we were getting a lot of great locations</i>
<i>and performances.</i>

26:46.148 --> 26:48.400
<i>And about a week into our time in Prague,</i>

26:48.483 --> 26:51.278
you know, the pandemic hit,

26:51.361 --> 26:53.322
or became very real,

26:53.405 --> 26:55.574
<i>and caused us to shut down.</i>

26:55.657 --> 27:00.954
<i>And, frankly, the bigger fear at that time</i>
<i>was that we would be stuck.</i>

27:01.038 --> 27:04.082
We called our line producer
at 2:00 in the morning for her, and said,

27:04.166 --> 27:07.252
"We're getting everybody on flights
out of Prague at 5:00 a.m.

27:07.336 --> 27:09.004
"You guys are leaving from 5:00 a.m.

27:09.087 --> 27:11.381
"We're gonna start calling
every crew member

27:11.465 --> 27:13.926
<i>"to tell them to get their stuff together.</i>

27:14.009 --> 27:16.803
<i>"We're gonna get everybody on flights.</i>

27:16.887 --> 27:19.681
<i>"By 9:00 a.m.,</i>
<i>everybody's gonna be on these flights."</i>

27:19.765 --> 27:23.602
<i>We had about 100 people there from the US</i>
<i>and we started flying people back.</i>

27:23.685 --> 27:28.106
Shutting down for COVID was a big part
of the struggle of the show.

27:28.190 --> 27:30.025
We're glad we did, it was the right thing.

27:30.108 --> 27:32.736
<i>And it, weirdly,</i>
<i>gave us more time editorially</i>

27:32.819 --> 27:34.738
<i>to really think about</i>
<i>what the show could be.</i>

27:34.821 --> 27:38.492
But it also was something
we'd never had to fight through before.

27:38.575 --> 27:41.286
<i>And it's a credit to our crew</i>
<i>that they stuck with us,</i>

27:41.370 --> 27:42.871
<i>continued to make the show.</i>

27:42.955 --> 27:44.206
<i>They were so invested.</i>

27:44.289 --> 27:45.832
<i>Even when we came back</i>

27:45.916 --> 27:48.919
<i>and COVID, obviously,</i>
<i>was still and is still an issue,</i>

27:49.002 --> 27:51.964
to figure out
how to mount the show safely,

27:52.047 --> 27:55.133
and to travel internationally safely
was a challenge.

27:55.217 --> 27:57.594
<i>But it was a challenge worth doing</i>

27:57.678 --> 28:00.973
<i>because I know</i>
<i>that it makes the show feel bigger.</i>

28:03.684 --> 28:06.979
SKOGLAND: <i>I have to say,</i>
<i>it gave us a certain kind of energy,</i>

28:07.062 --> 28:09.940
<i>which was bonding.</i>

28:10.023 --> 28:13.819
You know, it's a big crew
with lots of personalities.

28:13.902 --> 28:19.616
<i>And so, when we're all up against</i>
<i>such extraordinary circumstances,</i>

28:19.700 --> 28:23.912
it creates a brother and sisterhood
that is, I think, a bit extraordinary.

28:23.996 --> 28:26.582
-(BOTH CHEERING)
-(ALL APPLAUDING)

28:26.665 --> 28:28.959
Over the next, obviously, eight months,

28:29.042 --> 28:33.088
all we were doing with Disney is trying
to come together with a task force

28:33.172 --> 28:36.300
as to how we could restart things,
and when we'll be able to start.

28:36.383 --> 28:38.177
<i>We knew we had to go</i>
<i>back to Prague. Right?</i>

28:38.260 --> 28:39.970
(LAUGHS) <i>We hadn't finished in Prague.</i>

28:40.053 --> 28:43.307
We had to figure out
how to make the Prague government,

28:43.390 --> 28:46.852
the Czech government comfortable
with an American crew coming into Prague.

28:46.935 --> 28:49.563
Because, frankly, Prague didn't have
the same incidents of COVID

28:49.646 --> 28:51.356
that we did at the time.

28:51.440 --> 28:52.941
<i>Our scouting had to be virtual.</i>

28:53.025 --> 28:55.861
<i>We couldn't have people</i>
<i>flying back and forth.</i>

28:55.944 --> 28:57.738
<i>But our team rallied around</i>

28:57.821 --> 28:59.865
<i>and figured out</i>
<i>how to mount this production.</i>

28:59.948 --> 29:03.243
You know, I will say,
a credit to the writers as well,

29:03.327 --> 29:06.079
because as you're writing,
you're writing to a specific location,

29:06.163 --> 29:08.040
which is gonna dictate a specific story

29:08.123 --> 29:10.209
<i>to get you into Puerto Rico</i>
<i>and then into Prague,</i>

29:10.292 --> 29:12.461
<i>and you have to be nimble as storytellers.</i>

29:12.544 --> 29:15.172
<i>And in Kari Skogland's case,</i>
<i>as a filmmaker,</i>

29:15.255 --> 29:17.424
<i>to visually get your head</i>
<i>into this new place,</i>

29:17.508 --> 29:21.011
<i>and to figure out how to make it work</i>
<i>with the stuff that we shot in Atlanta</i>

29:21.094 --> 29:24.765
<i>that, frankly, was meant to match with</i>
<i>what we were gonna do in Puerto Rico.</i>

29:24.848 --> 29:26.642
There was a lot of thinking that went into

29:26.725 --> 29:29.144
how to adjust our entire production plan

29:29.228 --> 29:31.188
<i>to fit the realities of the world,</i>

29:31.271 --> 29:33.315
<i>but a credit to the crew</i>
<i>for figuring it out.</i>

29:34.525 --> 29:37.903
Do we want to live in a world
full of people like the Red Skull?

29:40.072 --> 29:41.949
That is why we're going to Madripoor.

29:42.032 --> 29:45.827
What's up with Madripoor?
You talk about it like it's Skull Island.

29:52.501 --> 29:54.962
BRÜHL: <i>We are in Madripoor.</i>

29:55.045 --> 29:58.257
<i>Dangerous, dodgy, lawless place</i>

29:58.340 --> 30:01.385
where Zemo has arranged a meeting
with Selby,

30:01.468 --> 30:03.428
<i>who's gonna give us, hopefully,</i>

30:03.512 --> 30:06.056
<i>precious information</i>
<i>about the super-soldier serum.</i>

30:06.139 --> 30:08.559
-Now that's the Zemo I remember.
-Hmm.

30:08.642 --> 30:11.687
I'm glad I decided
not to kill you immediately.

30:11.812 --> 30:14.231
We have to come here and it's not...

30:14.314 --> 30:17.276
We didn't get a warm welcome.
Let's put it that way.

30:17.359 --> 30:18.944
-And it's impressive to see...
-(THUDS)

30:19.027 --> 30:20.320
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

30:20.404 --> 30:22.614
You see? That's what happens in Madripoor.

30:22.698 --> 30:23.907
High Town's that way.

30:23.991 --> 30:27.494
Not a bad place if you wanna visit,
but Low Town's the other way.

30:29.621 --> 30:32.749
Let me guess.
We don't have any friends in High Town.

30:36.003 --> 30:39.423
SKOGLAND: <i>Ray Chan,</i>
<i>our production designer, is extraordinary,</i>

30:39.506 --> 30:42.759
and we looked for months,
I have to tell you.

30:42.843 --> 30:48.682
<i>And one day, we're standing</i>
<i>in a back alley of a series of crossroads,</i>

30:48.765 --> 30:51.518
and we looked at each other and I said,
"Do you think?"

30:51.602 --> 30:53.187
And he said, "I think I could."

30:53.270 --> 30:55.898
And I... "Okay. Oh, my goodness."

30:55.981 --> 30:58.275
<i>We started looking around</i>
<i>and mapping it out.</i>

30:58.358 --> 31:00.277
<i>And he came up with Madripoor</i>

31:00.360 --> 31:04.072
<i>in a series of back alleys</i>
<i>in a small town outside of Atlanta.</i>

31:05.157 --> 31:07.117
RAYMOND CHAN:
<i>We want to feel the back street,</i>

31:07.201 --> 31:08.660
it needs to be more gritty.

31:08.744 --> 31:12.331
Needs to feel more lawless.
It's a lawless society.

31:12.414 --> 31:15.876
Soon as we walked into this street,
it clearly was empty,

31:15.959 --> 31:18.545
it was just a two, three,
half a dozen buildings,

31:18.629 --> 31:20.297
of just red brick buildings,

31:20.380 --> 31:21.673
I thought, "This was tight.

31:21.757 --> 31:24.176
"It felt claustrophobic.
What can I do with it?"

31:26.970 --> 31:28.388
<i>Several months of research,</i>

31:28.472 --> 31:32.184
<i>and we found this back street in Hanoi,</i>
<i>in Vietnam,</i>

31:32.267 --> 31:36.271
<i>where the homeowners</i>
<i>would step out of their back doors,</i>

31:36.355 --> 31:37.648
<i>and there was this rail track</i>

31:37.731 --> 31:40.442
<i>running literally two feet away</i>
<i>from their back door.</i>

31:40.526 --> 31:44.112
I thought that would be an interesting
concept to bring to this street.

31:44.196 --> 31:48.242
<i>And having traveled the world,</i>
<i>I thought this is quite iconic,</i>

31:48.325 --> 31:50.577
<i>a bridge that I used to cross</i>
<i>in Mozambique,</i>

31:50.702 --> 31:52.204
<i>this heavy industry bridge.</i>

31:52.287 --> 31:56.208
So I married part of Mozambique
and a bit of Vietnam.

CHAN: (IN ENGLISH)
<i>This is called the Brass Monkey Bar.</i>

32:05.342 --> 32:08.846
It's an open bar.
You can see the stars through the ceiling.

32:08.929 --> 32:11.557
We thought we would look at it
with the fixtures

32:11.640 --> 32:13.100
<i>being able to give enough light,</i>

32:13.183 --> 32:15.102
<i>and, you know, not to light the set,</i>

32:15.185 --> 32:17.312
<i>but to have a cool ceiling,</i>
<i>a geometric ceiling.</i>

32:17.396 --> 32:22.150
Here, to your left,
are these crazy monkey skulls.

32:22.234 --> 32:23.610
My art director, Jennifer,

32:23.694 --> 32:27.823
she scoured the Internet,
and we purchased three skulls,

32:27.906 --> 32:28.907
<i>I think from memory,</i>

32:28.991 --> 32:31.660
and we sent them to our staff shop,
which they cast,

32:31.743 --> 32:34.246
I think, about 115 or 120 skulls.

32:34.329 --> 32:37.791
And yeah, so that's a homage
to The Brass Monkey.

32:41.170 --> 32:43.672
BARTENDER: Wasn't expecting you,
Smiling Tiger.

32:43.755 --> 32:44.923
His plans changed.

32:45.007 --> 32:48.552
CROW: <i>Anthony's character, Sam,</i>
<i>is very straight-laced.</i>

32:48.635 --> 32:52.222
We play him as very, sort of,
conservative dressed.

32:52.306 --> 32:54.766
<i>His clothes are, sort of,</i>
<i>every day, every man.</i>

32:54.850 --> 32:58.687
<i>I mean, we did do some crazy stuff</i>
<i>with him on this show,</i>

32:58.770 --> 33:00.022
<i>the wild African suit,</i>

33:00.105 --> 33:02.649
and he was totally game to go for it.

33:02.733 --> 33:04.026
MAN: Cut.
MACKIE: Whoo!

33:04.109 --> 33:06.111
I'm on. Let's roll again. I'm on!

33:08.739 --> 33:11.909
Sebastian is great to work with
'cause he gets into the character,

33:11.992 --> 33:15.078
and wants to know
why are we picking these things.

33:15.162 --> 33:19.041
<i>And because he's</i>
<i>sort of newly in the modern world,</i>

33:19.124 --> 33:25.422
I tried to make it feel
as classic and vintage as we could.

33:28.509 --> 33:31.053
Image-wise, it makes it very interesting

33:31.136 --> 33:34.765
<i>to see these three guys dressing up</i>
<i>in a very different way.</i>

33:34.848 --> 33:37.309
We have to do something about this.
I look like a pimp.

33:37.392 --> 33:41.355
BRÜHL: <i>It was fun to have these couple</i>
<i>of scenes with the full outfit, you know,</i>

33:41.438 --> 33:42.940
<i>with that incredible coat.</i>

33:43.023 --> 33:44.525
We had a lot of fun developing it.

33:44.608 --> 33:50.197
<i>You know, it's kind of based</i>
<i>on a World War II Russian military,</i>

33:50.280 --> 33:52.157
<i>Polish military overcoat,</i>

33:52.241 --> 33:57.955
and then we tried to make it a little
comic book-inspired on top of that.

33:58.038 --> 34:00.707
Yesterday, I had a day off,
and I went to a comic shop

34:00.791 --> 34:04.253
to see if I could find
some covers of Zemo.

34:04.336 --> 34:06.922
<i>So I got myself</i>
<i>a couple of comic books with Zemo.</i>

34:07.005 --> 34:10.759
<i>And it's just great</i>
<i>to finally look like him in the comics.</i>

34:11.593 --> 34:14.221
Hello, guys. Do you like my style?

34:14.888 --> 34:18.308
You can have it as well. Suitkovia.

34:18.392 --> 34:23.230
We offer elegant clothes,
but also casual clothes.

34:23.313 --> 34:28.360
Pajamas, sweaters, T-shirt,
socks, sneakers, everything.

34:28.443 --> 34:29.570
(SPEAKS RUSSIAN)

34:29.653 --> 34:35.158
(IN ENGLISH) Come and visit us in Sokovia.
Check out Suitkovia.

34:39.621 --> 34:40.622
MAN: Cut.

34:40.706 --> 34:42.833
(ALL LAUGHING)

34:45.419 --> 34:49.089
We created this marvelous space
for our characters to be off-grid.

34:49.173 --> 34:50.757
WOMAN: Well, this is too perfect.

34:53.844 --> 34:55.053
Drop it, Zemo.

34:56.138 --> 34:57.139
Sharon?

34:57.222 --> 35:00.267
SKOGLAND: <i>After a series of mishaps</i>
<i>with the S.H.I.E.L.D. and such,</i>

35:00.350 --> 35:04.146
<i>she has had to go to a place</i>
<i>where you can live with impunity.</i>

35:04.229 --> 35:08.066
I also took the wings for your ass
so that you can save his ass from his ass.

35:08.650 --> 35:11.320
Unlike you, I didn't have the Avengers
to back me up.

35:11.403 --> 35:13.071
So I'm off the grid in Madripoor.

35:13.155 --> 35:15.616
Bringing back Sharon Carter
was something that we explored

35:15.699 --> 35:17.075
even in <i>Avengers</i> three and four.

35:17.159 --> 35:19.870
And the truth was there were so many
characters in those films,

35:19.953 --> 35:22.206
you couldn't really
do her character justice,

35:22.289 --> 35:24.249
nor where we had left her in <i>Civil War.</i>

35:24.333 --> 35:28.253
<i>And interestingly enough, divorcing her</i>
<i>from her relationship with Steve Rogers</i>

35:28.337 --> 35:31.131
<i>actually allowed us to explore</i>
<i>a different side of the character.</i>

35:31.215 --> 35:35.010
<i>Because now, she doesn't have to be</i>
<i>the white hat who is only good.</i>

35:35.093 --> 35:37.971
<i>Now, we can explore what happened to her</i>
<i>as a result of</i> Civil War,

35:38.055 --> 35:40.140
and some of the more morally gray choices

35:40.224 --> 35:42.100
she's had to make
to survive in the universe.

35:42.184 --> 35:44.394
SHARON: <i>At some point,</i>
<i>I thought if I had to hustle,</i>

35:44.478 --> 35:46.438
might as well
enjoy the life of a real hustler.

35:46.522 --> 35:48.357
You know how much I can get
for a real Monet?

35:49.858 --> 35:52.402
Just a little bit tougher,
a little raw, you know,

35:52.486 --> 35:53.904
rough around the edges.

35:53.987 --> 35:57.366
A totally different version of Sharon
than we've seen in the films.

35:59.826 --> 36:02.037
VANCAMP: <i>There's so much about this</i>
<i>that I've loved.</i>

36:02.120 --> 36:06.959
<i>I got to do, physically,</i>
<i>a lot of stuff in this one that...</i>

36:07.042 --> 36:09.336
<i>It's always nice</i>
<i>to get back into your body and...</i>

36:09.419 --> 36:12.381
I used to be a dancer,
so doing fight training was a lot of fun.

36:12.464 --> 36:14.883
There you go. Feel that angle?
Good. You got it.

36:14.967 --> 36:16.426
WOMAN: There you go.
MAN: Good. There you go.

36:16.510 --> 36:19.847
One thing we thought was interesting
was positioning Sharon Carter

36:19.930 --> 36:22.599
as somebody who you think
is naturally altruistic,

36:22.683 --> 36:24.852
<i>but building the mythology</i>
<i>of this Power Broker</i>

36:24.935 --> 36:26.478
<i>who also plays in Madripoor,</i>

36:26.562 --> 36:28.480
<i>a new corner</i>
<i>of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</i>

36:28.564 --> 36:30.566
<i>The mystery of who the Power Broker is,</i>

36:30.649 --> 36:33.068
<i>we hope is satisfyingly revealed</i>
<i>in episode six.</i>

36:33.151 --> 36:34.361
Drop your weapon, Karli.

36:35.571 --> 36:36.989
SPELLMAN: <i>I thought for sure</i>

36:37.072 --> 36:39.408
<i>the Power Broker storyline</i>
<i>was not gonna work.</i>

36:39.491 --> 36:41.618
Sometimes, we would be too heavy-handed.

36:41.702 --> 36:43.579
You're like, "Nah, we see it coming."

36:43.662 --> 36:45.414
And sometimes, it would be too thin.

36:45.497 --> 36:48.792
<i>And then, the more we start to work on it,</i>

36:48.876 --> 36:50.252
<i>you're like, "Oh, this is great."</i>

36:50.335 --> 36:52.504
Come back and work for me again.
All of you.

36:52.588 --> 36:54.298
We can make a difference together.

36:54.840 --> 36:57.426
You just want me
because you need your muscle back.

36:57.509 --> 37:01.305
Without us Super Soldiers, how much power
does the Power Broker really have?

37:03.015 --> 37:04.224
More than you.

37:04.308 --> 37:08.520
MOORE: <i>We knew we needed an antagonist</i>
<i>to challenge the notion of symbols</i>

37:08.604 --> 37:10.314
<i>and ideology in the show.</i>

37:10.397 --> 37:12.900
And the Flag Smasher from the comics,
Karl Morgenthau,

37:12.983 --> 37:16.069
<i>is much different,</i>
<i>visually and in conceit,</i>

37:16.153 --> 37:18.155
<i>than Karli Morgenthau is in the MCU.</i>

37:18.238 --> 37:20.365
But the root of that character
is the same.

37:21.992 --> 37:24.036
You're becoming a bit of a legend.

37:24.119 --> 37:27.039
I hear more and more people
talk about the freedom fighters

37:27.122 --> 37:28.207
who are pushing back.

37:28.290 --> 37:32.044
Nothing in this show works
without Erin Kellyman.

37:33.045 --> 37:37.007
SKOGLAND: <i>What we were looking for was</i>
<i>kind of that innocent face that she has.</i>

37:37.591 --> 37:40.594
I wanted her to be unexpected.

37:40.677 --> 37:41.970
You okay?

37:45.140 --> 37:49.102
It had to be someone who,
besides being instantly likable,

37:49.186 --> 37:53.148
<i>was someone who, in her eyes,</i>
<i>has the resolve</i>

37:53.232 --> 37:57.819
<i>and the toughness of having had,</i>
<i>perhaps, a background</i>

37:57.903 --> 38:00.280
<i>that is written in her face.</i>

38:01.114 --> 38:03.075
It doesn't have to be a war, Karli.

38:03.158 --> 38:06.870
They started a war when they kicked us out
of our new homes and onto the street.

38:06.954 --> 38:09.331
People all around the world need me.
Millions of them.

38:09.414 --> 38:11.750
I can't speak for millions,
but I understand you.

38:14.628 --> 38:18.257
Can't have a hero and a villain
in the room together,

38:18.340 --> 38:21.176
having a conversation, and be honest

38:21.260 --> 38:23.971
unless it is earned at every level.

38:24.054 --> 38:26.473
<i>And the first level is the actor.</i>

38:26.557 --> 38:29.393
I'm trying to figure out
if I need to kill your brother.

38:31.436 --> 38:32.604
I thought I could trust him.

38:32.688 --> 38:36.733
I'd had, like,
a few FaceTimes with Kari and Zoie.

38:37.192 --> 38:39.486
<i>But obviously,</i>
<i>you can't put anything on that.</i>

38:39.570 --> 38:41.572
<i>So when I got told</i>
<i>that I got it, I was like,</i>

38:41.655 --> 38:44.366
(CHUCKLES) "This is gonna be wild."

38:44.449 --> 38:46.994
Like, I think
it didn't sink in straightaway.

38:47.077 --> 38:49.121
I don't even feel like
it's fully sunk in now.

38:49.204 --> 38:50.205
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

38:50.289 --> 38:51.790
Oh, it's very dramatic. (CHUCKLES)

38:51.874 --> 38:54.126
KELLYMAN: <i>I knew</i>
<i>that it was a comic character,</i>

38:54.209 --> 38:56.003
<i>so I'd done like a bunch of research.</i>

38:56.086 --> 38:58.213
<i>When I realized it was a guy,</i>
<i>I was like, okay,</i>

38:58.297 --> 39:01.425
<i>this is pretty sick that, first of all,</i>
<i>they've turned him into a girl.</i>

39:01.508 --> 39:02.885
The movement is ready.

39:04.887 --> 39:06.346
They're not going to stop.

39:07.055 --> 39:08.265
Not unless we make them.

39:08.348 --> 39:10.893
KELLYMAN: <i>In the comics,</i>
<i>in the research that I did,</i>

39:10.976 --> 39:14.980
<i>it was kind of</i>
<i>more pressing towards a villain.</i>

39:15.063 --> 39:19.318
<i>And now that I've kind of got the scripts</i>
<i>and understand her a little more,</i>

39:19.401 --> 39:22.029
I know that it's all out of a good place.
You know?

39:22.112 --> 39:24.156
Do you remember how scared we were
when we took the serum?

39:24.239 --> 39:26.158
DOVICH: (SNIFFLES)
Yeah, don't think I'll forget that.

39:26.241 --> 39:28.202
(BLOWS) Felt like my veins were on fire.

39:30.245 --> 39:31.830
I prayed it'd kill me.

39:34.374 --> 39:35.375
But it was worth it.

39:36.710 --> 39:40.339
SPELLMAN: <i>In constructing the character,</i>
<i>we were like, "Let's make her a kid."</i>

39:40.422 --> 39:45.969
<i>And, "Let's make her tap into the spirit</i>
<i>of how people feel today."</i>

39:46.053 --> 39:48.847
<i>And even though</i>
<i>the pandemic hadn't hit yet,</i>

39:48.931 --> 39:53.727
that all just exacerbated
a feeling folks were having.

39:53.810 --> 39:56.772
And if you're Black,
you've been having it your whole life,

39:56.855 --> 39:59.107
<i>which is, the game is rigged,</i>

39:59.566 --> 40:03.612
<i>the people who are at the top</i>
<i>are becoming irresponsible.</i>

40:03.695 --> 40:05.656
<i>We accept that the game is rigged,</i>

40:05.739 --> 40:09.993
<i>but now, they're getting irresponsible</i>
<i>in how much they're taking from us,</i>

40:10.077 --> 40:12.412
<i>and people just have to push back.</i>

40:12.496 --> 40:15.541
<i>And we wrote Karli as a hero.</i>

40:15.624 --> 40:17.876
She is a hero that goes bad.

40:17.960 --> 40:19.211
I don't wanna hurt you.

40:20.003 --> 40:22.589
You're just a tool in the regimes
I'm looking to destroy.

40:23.382 --> 40:24.800
You're not hiding behind a shield.

40:24.883 --> 40:26.385
MOORE: <i>The legacy of Steve Rogers is</i>

40:26.468 --> 40:29.346
people have always tried
to recreate that serum

40:29.429 --> 40:30.806
and it has never gone well.

40:30.889 --> 40:34.268
<i>You can ask Bruce Banner,</i>
<i>who, to some degree, became the Hulk</i>

40:34.351 --> 40:35.936
<i>because General Thaddeus Ross</i>

40:36.019 --> 40:38.355
<i>wanted to develop</i>
<i>his own super-soldier serum.</i>

40:38.438 --> 40:41.108
<i>Steve has always been</i>
<i>the pinnacle of what should be.</i>

40:41.191 --> 40:45.112
We thought it was interesting, again,
in dealing with the legacy of the shield

40:45.195 --> 40:47.406
<i>to see what happens</i>
<i>if somebody successfully</i>

40:47.489 --> 40:50.325
<i>did figure out how to break</i>
<i>the super-soldier serum code,</i>

40:50.409 --> 40:52.911
<i>and who those Super Soldiers then become.</i>

40:52.995 --> 40:54.830
It doesn't even matter if we die.

40:54.913 --> 40:57.541
The movement is strong enough
to continue without us.

40:57.624 --> 41:00.752
MOORE: <i>And I think that's what makes</i>
<i>the Flag Smashers so interesting.</i>

41:00.836 --> 41:04.882
<i>Is you get to explore the different side</i>
<i>of what happens when people</i>

41:04.965 --> 41:07.926
<i>who, frankly, sometimes</i>
<i>are downtrodden or overlooked</i>

41:08.010 --> 41:10.387
are given power
that they don't typically have.

41:11.346 --> 41:13.557
-KARLI: You shouldn't have come here.
-(GRUNTS)

41:14.433 --> 41:15.809
We're in episode 102.

41:15.893 --> 41:19.438
And this is the first time
that Sam and Bucky

41:19.521 --> 41:22.900
<i>have fought beside each other,</i>
<i>and they're not doing terribly well.</i>

41:22.983 --> 41:24.860
Good of you to join the fight, Sam!

41:24.943 --> 41:26.028
(GRUNTS)

41:26.111 --> 41:27.696
-Punch, kick, punch, punch!
-(ALL LAUGHING)

41:27.779 --> 41:31.074
And John Walker arrives
kind of out of the blue.

41:31.158 --> 41:33.118
John Walker, Captain America.

41:33.202 --> 41:36.079
-Lemar Hoskins.
-Looks like you guys could use some help.

41:36.163 --> 41:38.457
SKOGLAND: <i>First time</i>
<i>they see him in action.</i>

41:38.540 --> 41:44.004
<i>And so it's his first action beat</i>
<i>as well as Captain America with Lemar.</i>

41:44.087 --> 41:46.715
<i>And the whole thing is a complete cluster.</i>

41:50.135 --> 41:53.555
<i>Then on top of it,</i>
<i>they're facing Super Soldiers</i>

41:53.639 --> 41:57.017
<i>and they are completely overwhelmed</i>
<i>with what that is.</i>

41:57.100 --> 41:58.435
STAN: No!

41:59.978 --> 42:02.481
SKOGLAND: <i>We started</i>
<i>dreaming up this sequence,</i>

42:02.564 --> 42:06.235
I would say, about eight months ago.

42:06.818 --> 42:09.530
And we had little toy cars
and little toy trucks,

42:09.613 --> 42:11.782
<i>and, we went through, I don't know,</i>

42:11.865 --> 42:17.746
<i>probably 12 or 15 different versions</i>
<i>of this sequence,</i>

42:17.829 --> 42:21.959
<i>because it was so difficult to achieve</i>
<i>on the one hand</i>

42:22.042 --> 42:24.795
<i>to imagine on the other,</i>
<i>with this many people</i>

42:24.878 --> 42:28.048
<i>dealing with all the various elements</i>
<i>that one has to deal with.</i>

42:28.715 --> 42:30.592
The truck sequence was always challenging.

42:30.676 --> 42:33.011
<i>Mostly because</i>
<i>they all need to stay on the trucks.</i>

42:33.095 --> 42:34.763
<i>No one can fall off the truck.</i>

42:34.847 --> 42:36.598
<i>No one can get back on the truck.</i>

42:36.682 --> 42:38.892
<i>Falcon can fly around a bit,</i>
<i>but for the most part,</i>

42:39.017 --> 42:41.436
<i>just the design of it,</i>
<i>it was a very challenging design.</i>

42:41.520 --> 42:44.606
<i>We had fake trucks</i>
<i>that were four feet off the ground</i>

42:44.690 --> 42:46.859
<i>and they could be moved around</i>
<i>on air a bit,</i>

42:46.942 --> 42:48.569
<i>we had people fighting on those.</i>

42:48.652 --> 42:49.820
<i>Then we got real trucks</i>

42:49.903 --> 42:53.782
<i>and we had a couple of shots with people</i>
<i>fighting on real trucks, but not many.</i>

42:53.866 --> 42:55.200
<i>We're shooting in Atlanta.</i>

42:55.284 --> 42:57.786
<i>We shot plates</i>
<i>of a road that we thought</i>

42:57.870 --> 43:00.539
<i>might be able to double</i>
<i>for some part of Germany.</i>

43:00.622 --> 43:03.625
Then it became clear that,
Atlanta does not look like Germany.

43:03.709 --> 43:05.919
So, what was a bunch of guys
on a blue screen

43:06.003 --> 43:07.754
<i>that we're gonna replace the background,</i>

43:07.838 --> 43:09.965
<i>now becomes</i>
<i>a complete digital environment.</i>

43:10.048 --> 43:13.760
<i>So, digital mountains in the background,</i>
<i>all sorts of German trees.</i>

43:13.844 --> 43:15.554
<i>Everything needed to be touched.</i>

43:16.722 --> 43:21.018
<i>Bucky is hanging onto the side of a truck</i>
<i>with spinning wheels right by his head</i>

43:21.101 --> 43:24.062
<i>that are completely digital.</i>
<i>The road is completely digital.</i>

43:24.563 --> 43:28.942
<i>There's a shot where Walker falls off</i>
<i>the back of the truck in Atlanta</i>

43:29.026 --> 43:31.528
<i>and then we cut to him</i>
<i>getting up in Prague.</i>

43:31.612 --> 43:35.115
<i>We need to make both of those things match</i>
<i>and both look like Germany.</i>

43:35.657 --> 43:38.660
<i>Adding digital cars and digital trees,</i>
<i>make everything match,</i>

43:38.744 --> 43:39.912
<i>it was kind of amazing.</i>

43:41.371 --> 43:43.207
(BOTH GRUNTING)

43:44.458 --> 43:46.585
-(GROANS)
-Could have used that shield.

43:48.378 --> 43:50.797
SKOGLAND: <i>When starting any series,</i>
<i>you wanna kick off</i>

43:50.881 --> 43:55.260
with as much promise of what the series
is going to be as possible.

43:56.136 --> 43:58.931
WATERSON: <i>We had to say,</i>
<i>"What don't we know that Falcon can do?</i>

43:59.014 --> 44:02.476
"What are some cool other things
that the Falcon we know he can do

44:02.559 --> 44:04.228
"that we haven't seen before?"

44:06.730 --> 44:10.192
NAGELHOUT: <i>Part of the mandate is,</i>
<i>all right, well, if we're gonna do Falcon</i>

44:10.275 --> 44:13.946
as a titular character finally,
he's gotta have the best Falcon action.

44:15.322 --> 44:19.076
SKOGLAND: <i>I think the opening action</i>
<i>sequence, kind of, took us down that path</i>

44:19.159 --> 44:21.828
in the sense of a, just a, "Holy cow."

44:22.371 --> 44:24.957
If we get to the border,
he's not gonna follow.

44:25.040 --> 44:26.542
-(CLICKING)
-What's up?

44:28.418 --> 44:32.422
We spent a long time on this sequence.
This sequence was always part of the show.

44:32.506 --> 44:34.132
It moved around parts of the show

44:34.216 --> 44:36.218
and it was supposed to be
this amazing thing.

44:37.594 --> 44:39.805
<i>Like any sequence we start with pre-vis</i>

44:39.888 --> 44:43.225
<i>and we work through the blocking</i>
<i>based on storyboards that have been done.</i>

44:43.308 --> 44:46.979
<i>And then we looked at the pre-vis,</i>
<i>like, "Okay, how are we gonna do this?"</i>

44:47.604 --> 44:50.065
NAGELHOUT: <i>One of the things</i>
<i>that we did was actually,</i>

44:50.148 --> 44:52.276
<i>we shot a group of skydivers.</i>

44:52.359 --> 44:54.778
And so, we had
all this great reference material.

44:58.240 --> 45:01.118
LEVEN: <i>We have, literally,</i>
<i>the world's best wingsuit fliers</i>

45:01.201 --> 45:03.453
<i>who are ready to do this stuff for us</i>

45:03.537 --> 45:06.206
and get these shots
that no one has ever seen before.

45:06.290 --> 45:08.166
Everyone was really excited about it.

45:08.250 --> 45:11.044
We spent several days pushing people
out of planes

45:11.128 --> 45:15.007
and getting all those suits...
(CHUCKLES) Those wingsuits are all real.

45:15.090 --> 45:17.843
<i>And we were inspired by a team</i>
<i>that does that, you know,</i>

45:17.926 --> 45:19.094
<i>flies through canyons.</i>

45:22.014 --> 45:25.350
MOORE: <i>They all had Blackmagic cameras</i>
<i>that we were able to mount on them,</i>

45:25.434 --> 45:27.144
<i>and then had head-mounted cameras.</i>

45:27.227 --> 45:29.813
There are a few shots
from that skydiving shoot

45:29.897 --> 45:31.523
<i>that made it into the sequence.</i>

45:31.607 --> 45:34.109
<i>So, you get those pops of real</i>
<i>that, I think,</i>

45:34.193 --> 45:37.237
<i>help with the suspension of disbelief</i>
<i>for the audience.</i>

45:38.530 --> 45:40.365
And, you know, we had Mackie on wires.

45:40.449 --> 45:42.117
I could do a Will Smith one.

45:42.201 --> 45:45.329
-I can go for what, "Sweet Jesus!"
-(ALL LAUGHING)

45:45.412 --> 45:48.665
NAGELHOUT: <i>We had real Mackie, you know,</i>
<i>folded in wherever we could.</i>

45:55.047 --> 45:58.175
<i>Most of the helicopters were CG.</i>
<i>We did have a buck,</i>

45:58.258 --> 46:00.552
like a helicopter buck,
for the interior work,

46:00.636 --> 46:03.305
'cause obviously, the actors
have to interact with something

46:03.388 --> 46:04.890
<i>but we even replaced the buck</i>

46:04.973 --> 46:07.392
<i>because it was a very specific</i>
<i>kind of helicopter</i>

46:07.476 --> 46:09.937
<i>that we wanted to see in the sequence</i>
<i>that would fit</i>

46:10.020 --> 46:12.481
<i>the storytelling of the villains</i>
<i>in that sequence.</i>

46:14.525 --> 46:17.236
And that's a huge testament
to our visual effects team,

46:17.319 --> 46:21.240
<i>to Victoria, to Eric Levin.</i>
<i>It's a pretty amazing thing.</i>

46:21.323 --> 46:23.158
For me the most impressive thing about it

46:23.242 --> 46:26.578
<i>was being able to mix</i>
<i>all the different techniques that we have.</i>

46:26.662 --> 46:30.374
<i>You know, it's one thing to have</i>
<i>a fully animated CG landscape</i>

46:30.457 --> 46:32.209
<i>and make it look</i>
<i>as photo-real as possible.</i>

46:32.292 --> 46:34.962
<i>But making sure that we do have close-ups</i>
<i>of Anthony Mackie,</i>

46:35.045 --> 46:37.923
<i>a couple shots of him flying on wires</i>
<i>and the stunt guys.</i>

46:38.006 --> 46:40.300
<i>And the aerial guys</i>
<i>jumping out of airplanes.</i>

46:41.093 --> 46:43.512
Having enough sort of realistic stuff

46:43.595 --> 46:46.390
so when you put it together,
you're not sure how we did anything.

46:46.473 --> 46:48.141
We gotta find another way!

46:48.225 --> 46:49.476
I just did.

46:54.940 --> 46:56.275
(GRUNTS)

46:59.778 --> 47:01.405
MOORE: <i>The idea is to make it seamless.</i>

47:01.488 --> 47:06.034
The idea is that it is a shared universe
that you can never know what to expect.

47:06.118 --> 47:08.495
<i>So, characters may come in</i>
<i>and out of shows,</i>

47:08.579 --> 47:11.915
<i>may come in and out of films</i>
<i>in a way that hopefully feels organic.</i>

47:11.999 --> 47:14.459
DON CHEADLE: <i>We're shooting</i>
<i>a scene in the museum,</i>

47:14.543 --> 47:17.045
<i>where, Falcon, Anthony's character, Sam,</i>

47:17.421 --> 47:20.716
is deciding whether or not
he's going to...

47:20.799 --> 47:25.053
Well, I guess he's decided
that he's going to actually give

47:25.137 --> 47:28.891
the shield to the museum to hold

47:28.974 --> 47:33.395
<i>as opposed to him taking it on</i>
<i>and becoming Captain America himself.</i>

47:33.478 --> 47:38.358
<i>I think Rhodey both understands</i>
<i>why Sam doesn't wanna take it on.</i>

47:38.442 --> 47:41.445
<i>He's been in a similar position</i>
<i>with Iron Patriot,</i>

47:41.528 --> 47:43.822
<i>with a decision about Iron Man.</i>

47:44.281 --> 47:46.533
But I think he also wishes that he would,

47:46.617 --> 47:48.869
because he thinks
it's very needed right now.

47:48.952 --> 47:50.245
The world's broken.

47:51.371 --> 47:53.749
Everybody's just looking for somebody
to fix it.

47:53.832 --> 47:59.171
Don Cheadle and I discussed the role
a few times before he got here.

47:59.254 --> 48:03.550
And he really wanted to bring
something to the character,

48:03.634 --> 48:08.347
<i>and we talked a lot about,</i>
<i>then, also, the one guy</i>

48:08.430 --> 48:11.266
<i>who could really understand the complexity</i>

48:11.350 --> 48:14.019
<i>of what it is for a Black man</i>
<i>to carry the shield.</i>

48:14.561 --> 48:19.775
He is the one guy
who Sam could connect with on that level,

48:20.234 --> 48:25.864
and, so that became a really complex
dance between the two guys.

48:25.948 --> 48:29.910
<i>You know, for me, watching the two of them</i>
<i>go through this amazing history</i>

48:29.993 --> 48:33.038
<i>we shot in our version of the Smithsonian,</i>

48:33.121 --> 48:35.374
<i>which was the history</i>
<i>of the Howling Commandos</i>

48:35.457 --> 48:37.543
<i>alongside Captain America,</i>

48:37.626 --> 48:42.589
and it was so poignant
to see them walking through the history

48:42.673 --> 48:46.426
as we're putting that history to bed,
you know, it was giving us all chills.

48:55.310 --> 48:57.187
NAGELHOUT: <i>I think something</i>
<i>the comics do,</i>

48:57.271 --> 48:58.981
<i>which works for that medium,</i>

48:59.064 --> 49:01.400
<i>is they assume that a mantle has to exist.</i>

49:01.483 --> 49:03.569
<i>Of course there's gonna be</i>
<i>a Captain America.</i>

49:03.652 --> 49:06.572
<i>If something happens to Steve,</i>
<i>somebody's gotta pick up that shield.</i>

49:08.949 --> 49:12.286
<i>That's a very, you know,</i>
<i>comic book-true statement</i>

49:12.369 --> 49:14.997
and it works for that format,
and it's great,

49:15.080 --> 49:18.083
and it allows you to see that shield
pass through hands.

49:18.709 --> 49:23.964
However, when you translate that
to a live-action sort of grounded story,

49:24.047 --> 49:25.382
<i>and to our real world,</i>

49:25.465 --> 49:27.885
<i>it's really important</i>
<i>to ask the question of why.</i>

49:27.968 --> 49:30.012
<i>Why does there have to be</i>
<i>a Captain America?</i>

49:30.095 --> 49:32.264
<i>What does it mean today</i>
<i>versus what it meant</i>

49:32.347 --> 49:33.891
<i>when it was created in the '40s?</i>

49:33.974 --> 49:36.101
<i>And what does it mean to different people?</i>

49:36.185 --> 49:37.519
SAM: <i>Feels weird...</i>

49:38.353 --> 49:39.438
<i>Picking it up again.</i>

49:41.356 --> 49:46.236
The legacy of that shield is complicated,
to say the least.

49:46.820 --> 49:50.824
MACKIE: <i>Sam, you know,</i>
<i>being a soldier and being a veteran,</i>

49:50.908 --> 49:56.413
<i>being a counselor, he realizes</i>
<i>that as a people, we're all Americans.</i>

49:56.997 --> 49:58.790
<i>I'm not Black Captain America.</i>

49:58.874 --> 50:01.001
<i>Steve wasn't white Captain America.</i>

50:01.084 --> 50:03.587
<i>He was solely Captain America.</i>

50:03.670 --> 50:07.341
So as a society, as a country,
we need to realize

50:07.424 --> 50:11.470
that all the people
who are citizens here on this soil,

50:11.553 --> 50:15.432
no matter what their origins are,
they're Americans

50:15.516 --> 50:19.561
<i>and, you know, the old adage,</i>
<i>"I am my brother's keeper,"</i>

50:19.645 --> 50:21.230
<i>comes into play, you know.</i>

50:21.313 --> 50:23.524
<i>Sam realizes he deserves the right,</i>

50:23.607 --> 50:25.734
<i>he's earned the right</i>
<i>to be Captain America</i>

50:25.817 --> 50:28.487
<i>and that has nothing to do</i>
<i>with his race or his background.</i>

50:28.946 --> 50:32.115
I ain't gonna lie. You're special.

50:34.117 --> 50:35.118
Thank you.

50:36.537 --> 50:41.124
I mean, you ain't no Malcolm or Martin,
Mandela, but...

50:41.208 --> 50:44.503
No argument there,
but I know what I've gotta do.

50:47.840 --> 50:49.800
MOORE: <i>Isaiah Bradley</i>
<i>is a character, I think,</i>

50:49.883 --> 50:51.635
<i>comic fans have been clamoring for,</i>

50:51.718 --> 50:55.472
<i>but most fans won't know.</i>
<i>he was a Black soldier who,</i>

50:55.556 --> 50:57.558
<i>much like the Tuskegee Airmen,</i>

50:57.641 --> 51:00.936
<i>was tested on to try and recreate</i>
<i>the super-soldier serum.</i>

51:01.019 --> 51:03.814
The secret of Isaiah Bradley
is that it worked,

51:03.897 --> 51:06.149
but because of his race, he was sidelined

51:06.233 --> 51:08.569
<i>by the American government</i>
<i>and became a pariah.</i>

51:08.652 --> 51:12.364
You think you can wake up one day
and decide who you wanna be?

51:13.740 --> 51:15.075
It doesn't work like that.

51:15.784 --> 51:18.495
When you have two characters
like Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes,

51:18.579 --> 51:19.913
who are so close to Steve,

51:19.997 --> 51:23.208
to meet a Super Soldier
who had a completely different experience

51:23.292 --> 51:26.503
than the one that Captain America had,
is gonna be eye-opening

51:26.587 --> 51:29.882
<i>and very much informs Sam's feelings</i>
<i>surrounding the shield.</i>

51:29.965 --> 51:33.760
<i>Whether or not that's a legitimate thing</i>
<i>to wish for or to not.</i>

51:33.844 --> 51:35.179
ISAIAH: That what I think it is?

51:36.972 --> 51:38.849
Mmm-mmm. Leave it covered.

51:40.392 --> 51:43.353
Them stars and stripes
don't mean nothin' good to me.

51:43.437 --> 51:45.314
When we first
started talking with Malcolm,

51:45.397 --> 51:47.566
that was a character he asked about first

51:47.649 --> 51:49.902
<i>because, as a Black man reading comics,</i>

51:49.985 --> 51:52.029
<i>that was a story that resonated with him</i>

51:52.112 --> 51:54.281
<i>when you go back to</i>
Truth: Red, White and Black.

51:54.364 --> 51:57.242
<i>So it was something</i>
<i>that he really brought to the project</i>

51:57.326 --> 51:59.286
<i>and I think enriched the story-telling,</i>

51:59.369 --> 52:01.705
<i>'cause it's a point of view</i>
<i>that is often lost,</i>

52:01.788 --> 52:06.251
<i>and again, unfortunately, society</i>
<i>sometimes catches up with narrative.</i>

52:06.335 --> 52:09.546
It's something that we're talking about
very much in our everyday lives.

52:09.630 --> 52:13.884
What is the journey of being Black
in America through time?

52:13.967 --> 52:15.719
<i>Not even just in the modern days,</i>

52:15.802 --> 52:18.347
<i>but in the '40s, in the '50s.</i>

52:18.430 --> 52:20.849
<i>It's always been</i>
<i>quite a different journey.</i>

52:20.933 --> 52:24.603
<i>And this gets to be an interesting lens</i>
<i>into that time and that character,</i>

52:24.686 --> 52:27.606
which very much informs
how people feel about race today.

52:27.689 --> 52:29.191
I used to be like you,

52:30.692 --> 52:32.528
until I opened my eyes,

52:33.612 --> 52:37.407
until I saw men in the Red Tails,

52:37.491 --> 52:41.537
the famous 332 fight for this country,

52:42.329 --> 52:45.999
only to come home to find
crosses burned on their lawn.

52:46.083 --> 52:48.168
I'm from the south. I get that.

52:48.794 --> 52:51.797
But you were a Super Soldier like Steve.
You could've been the next...

52:51.880 --> 52:54.633
The next? What? Huh?

52:56.218 --> 52:59.429
Blonde hair, blue eyes, stars and stripes?

52:59.513 --> 53:02.975
He becomes the embodiment
of your hero's fears.

53:03.058 --> 53:05.227
<i>Isaiah is challenging Sam</i>

53:05.894 --> 53:08.981
<i>just on whether or not</i>
<i>a Black man should be Captain America.</i>

53:09.064 --> 53:12.693
He has that line where, "They will never
let a Black man be Captain America,

53:12.776 --> 53:15.946
"and even if they did, no self-respecting
Black man would ever wanna be."

53:16.029 --> 53:18.156
<i>We didn't want Isaiah</i>
<i>to be wrong about that.</i>

53:18.240 --> 53:20.576
<i>That's gonna be</i>
<i>part of his ongoing struggle.</i>

53:20.659 --> 53:24.162
<i>He says, "Man, I know every time</i>
<i>I pick the shield up,</i>

53:24.246 --> 53:26.206
<i>"a portion of the world's</i>
<i>gonna hate me for it."</i>

53:26.290 --> 53:29.710
Sam gotta live with that as he goes off
and tries to make this work.

53:31.879 --> 53:33.589
It's been an emotional experience,

53:33.672 --> 53:35.924
especially in the time
in which we live in now.

53:36.008 --> 53:39.094
<i>For Marvel to give me the opportunity</i>
<i>as a Black man,</i>

53:39.553 --> 53:42.681
<i>from the south, to become Captain America,</i>

53:42.764 --> 53:45.809
I think, says a lot, not only about
the work that I've put in

53:45.893 --> 53:48.395
to get to this point
that they would entrust me with that,

53:48.478 --> 53:54.318
<i>but the way that they're hoping to change</i>
<i>the way society looks at itself.</i>

53:54.401 --> 53:57.779
Look, you people have just as much
power as an insane god

53:59.573 --> 54:01.408
or a misguided teenager.

54:03.869 --> 54:07.956
The question you have to ask yourself is,
"How are you gonna use it?"

54:08.040 --> 54:10.501
That last speech that Sam has,

54:10.584 --> 54:13.253
that's me and Anthony on the phone
for a few hours.

54:13.337 --> 54:16.340
<i>Anthony has a Black man's perspective</i>
<i>on the world.</i>

54:16.423 --> 54:20.511
And he's like,
"Mal, I gotta believe this, right?"

54:20.594 --> 54:22.471
So the first thing we did was

54:22.554 --> 54:25.265
<i>we had Sam talking to somebody</i>
<i>in that scene</i>

54:25.349 --> 54:26.975
<i>instead of giving a speech.</i>

54:27.059 --> 54:30.145
And then, the next thing was me
on the phone with him for hours

54:30.229 --> 54:34.316
making sure he felt honest
at every single line in this thing.

54:34.399 --> 54:37.110
You know what I'm saying?
So now we are super proud of that.

54:37.194 --> 54:40.906
We finally have a common struggle now.

54:40.989 --> 54:42.199
Think about that.

54:42.699 --> 54:45.369
For once, all the people
who've been begging,

54:45.452 --> 54:48.372
and I mean, literally begging for you

54:48.497 --> 54:52.417
to feel how hard any given day is,
now you know.

54:54.795 --> 54:58.173
SKOGLAND: <i>The final costume</i>
<i>is very much drawn from the comics.</i>

54:58.257 --> 55:00.509
<i>Drawing from the comics</i>
<i>was really important</i>

55:00.592 --> 55:03.762
<i>because it had its own legacy</i>
<i>to start with.</i>

55:03.846 --> 55:06.223
<i>So all the detail that goes into every...</i>

55:06.306 --> 55:12.104
And I can tell you,
months of thought went into every seam.

55:12.187 --> 55:14.731
Not only in the building of it,
but in the design of it.

55:14.815 --> 55:16.567
CROW: <i>It's kind of a breath of fresh air.</i>

55:16.650 --> 55:20.070
<i>Visually, it's almost the reverse</i>
<i>of the other costumes we've seen.</i>

55:20.153 --> 55:21.280
<i>There's a lot of white</i>

55:21.363 --> 55:24.449
<i>as opposed to all the navy and red</i>
<i>that we've seen before.</i>

55:24.533 --> 55:28.161
The upper torso and his face
are really kind of highlighted.

55:28.245 --> 55:29.705
LEVEN: <i>Captain America's new costume</i>

55:29.788 --> 55:32.916
<i>had a very specific cowl design</i>
<i>that they wanted.</i>

55:33.000 --> 55:36.044
And it was very difficult
to build practically in real life,

55:36.128 --> 55:39.423
<i>so when Mackie would move his head around,</i>
<i>it would flex.</i>

55:39.506 --> 55:42.968
<i>Because there is no magical material</i>
<i>that can have that shape</i>

55:43.051 --> 55:46.388
<i>and that flexibility and not move around</i>
<i>in a way that they didn't want.</i>

55:46.471 --> 55:47.931
<i>So, they knew when they built it.</i>

55:48.015 --> 55:51.185
"This is gonna be really tough,
you're gonna have to help us out."

55:51.268 --> 55:54.313
And as it turned out, you know,
there were dozens and dozens,

55:54.396 --> 55:58.233
<i>probably hundreds of visual effects shots</i>
<i>just to make that cowl look better.</i>

55:58.317 --> 56:00.819
<i>So that it looks heroic</i>
<i>and doesn't have weird gaps.</i>

56:00.903 --> 56:02.863
<i>We don't want to see</i>
<i>any seams in the costume,</i>

56:02.946 --> 56:05.073
<i>we don't want to know</i>
<i>that it was closed by Velcro.</i>

56:05.157 --> 56:06.158
<i>It's just magically...</i>

56:06.241 --> 56:08.577
It's a magic costume
built by the Wakandans,

56:08.660 --> 56:10.120
so we need to bring that to life.

56:10.204 --> 56:11.371
MACKIE: All right, watch this!

56:15.751 --> 56:18.212
SKOGLAND: <i>I think it was</i>
<i>all to support a combination</i>

56:18.295 --> 56:22.257
<i>of what the overall red, white</i>
<i>and blue look was going to be</i>

56:22.341 --> 56:24.676
<i>and that it had to be bright and positive.</i>

56:24.760 --> 56:28.514
<i>There had to be</i>
<i>an ultimately positive vibe to this,</i>

56:29.181 --> 56:33.310
you know, sparkling person... (CHUCKLES)

56:33.393 --> 56:36.480
Which is, and really beautifully, shown,

56:36.563 --> 56:38.857
<i>I think, in the final speech.</i>

56:38.941 --> 56:43.070
It has a, you know, a bit of
a knight in shining armor quality to it.

56:46.156 --> 56:48.033
STAN: <i>It's a new</i>
<i>Captain America, you know,</i>

56:48.116 --> 56:51.203
it's a new angle, and it's a new vibe

56:51.286 --> 56:53.455
<i>and I think</i>
<i>he's got some really cool things</i>

56:53.539 --> 56:56.250
<i>that are being explored in this</i>
<i>from the idea of family,</i>

56:56.333 --> 56:59.503
<i>pursuit of happiness</i>
<i>versus this American Dream</i>

56:59.586 --> 57:01.129
<i>that's bestowed on all of us,</i>

57:01.213 --> 57:03.298
<i>but certainly how</i>
<i>a Black man deals with that.</i>

57:03.382 --> 57:05.676
<i>I mean, there's all kinds of</i>
<i>actually complex,</i>

57:05.759 --> 57:08.178
<i>very specific issues dealt in this</i>

57:08.262 --> 57:10.556
that are very applicable
to the times that we're in.

57:10.639 --> 57:14.017
This isn't about easy decisions, Senator.

57:14.101 --> 57:15.644
You just don't understand.

57:15.727 --> 57:19.523
(SCOFFS) I'm a Black man
carrying the stars and stripes.

57:19.606 --> 57:21.525
What don't I understand?

57:21.608 --> 57:24.403
I know what it is
to deal with something bigger than me.

57:25.737 --> 57:29.449
With everything that's been going on
with COVID

57:29.533 --> 57:32.870
and the murders of Breonna

57:32.953 --> 57:35.831
and the murder of George Floyd

57:36.248 --> 57:41.837
and, you know, the riots and the activism

57:41.920 --> 57:45.090
going on with the young generation now
and, you know,

57:45.174 --> 57:46.800
the Black Lives Matter movement,

57:46.884 --> 57:51.638
<i>it's been jarring to me and surprising</i>
<i>how timely this series is.</i>

57:59.062 --> 58:02.524
<i>My truth has changed and evolved so much.</i>

58:02.608 --> 58:04.151
<i>As far as me being a father,</i>

58:04.234 --> 58:07.321
<i>as far as me being a man,</i>
<i>and as far as me being an American.</i>

58:07.404 --> 58:11.116
<i>And a lot of that</i>
<i>has come out of this role and this series.</i>

58:12.284 --> 58:15.078
So, it's been humbling in a real sense,

58:15.162 --> 58:17.164
but also inspiring to think

58:17.247 --> 58:21.543
that my sons will be able
to turn on the TV and see,

58:21.627 --> 58:23.712
<i>a Black Captain America.</i>

58:23.795 --> 58:25.506
ISAIAH: <i>Ain't gonna be easy, Sam.</i>

58:26.089 --> 58:28.550
SAM: <i>Yeah, I might fail. I might die.</i>

58:29.218 --> 58:30.928
<i>But we built this country.</i>

58:31.011 --> 58:32.346
<i>Bled for it.</i>

58:33.347 --> 58:36.350
<i>I'm not gonna let anybody tell me</i>
<i>I can't fight for it.</i>

58:45.901 --> 58:48.278
