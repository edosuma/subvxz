WEBVTT

00:01.004 --> 00:03.190
And just when they thought
all hope was lost...

00:03.191 --> 00:05.518
Hi. Oh no. Am I too late?
Did I miss storytelling?

00:05.519 --> 00:07.213
No, no. We're just
getting to the good part.

00:07.214 --> 00:09.993
So, he turned up the music,
threw a raging party...

00:14.234 --> 00:16.885
Yeah!

00:16.886 --> 00:19.071
And fell in love with a hooker.

00:20.776 --> 00:22.329
Oh, I get to be the hooker.

00:24.732 --> 00:26.877
Whoo.

00:26.878 --> 00:28.136
And that wraps up tonight's edition

00:28.137 --> 00:29.698
of drive-in with daddy.

00:31.311 --> 00:32.689
Wow. "Risky Business."

00:33.023 --> 00:36.019
Kind of threw me there, 'cause I
thought tonight's movie was "Goldilocks."

00:36.020 --> 00:37.061
Oh, well,

00:37.062 --> 00:39.100
Tucker was tired of being the baby bear.

00:40.610 --> 00:43.736
Well, I do enjoy these
father-daughter moments.

00:43.737 --> 00:46.079
And in fact, you've kind of inspired me

00:46.080 --> 00:47.911
to find my own biological father.

00:47.912 --> 00:49.874
Which by the way, I have.

00:50.630 --> 00:51.733
No way!

00:51.734 --> 00:52.884
Yes, way. Well, ever since

00:52.885 --> 00:54.906
I found out that aunt Margot
actually gave birth to me,

00:54.907 --> 00:56.787
I've wanted to know who he is,

00:56.788 --> 00:59.526
but my mom forbid Margot
from saying anything.

00:59.527 --> 01:02.398
So my dad slipped me his old yearbook

01:02.399 --> 01:05.266
and said "page 37, Mark Clements.

01:05.268 --> 01:07.626
That's the bastard who
knocked up your aunt Margot."

01:09.678 --> 01:10.978
I love my dad.

01:11.856 --> 01:13.533
Attention, ladies and gentlemen,

01:13.534 --> 01:15.168
parents arriving momentarily.

01:15.169 --> 01:17.236
Next stop, dysfunction junction.

01:20.577 --> 01:21.748
And they're here.

01:22.371 --> 01:24.018
Let the judging begin.

01:26.476 --> 01:27.978
- Tucker.
- Dad.

01:29.282 --> 01:31.178
Wait, where's mom?

01:31.756 --> 01:33.175
See, I told her you'd notice.

01:34.372 --> 01:36.020
I said, "Joanne, the boy's gonna notice."

01:37.972 --> 01:39.646
Dad, what's going on? Is something wrong?

01:39.647 --> 01:40.534
Not at all.

01:40.840 --> 01:42.303
Your mother and I are getting a divorce.

01:44.478 --> 01:45.894
So...

01:45.895 --> 01:48.425
Then the three little bears, trying
to avoid a very awkward situation,

01:48.426 --> 01:49.965
all took Goldilocks to bed. Let's go.

01:52.857 --> 01:54.926
You know, the big one isn't wearing pants.

02:08.281 --> 02:09.429
<i>Divorced?</i>

02:09.430 --> 02:12.113
Dude, I cannot believe I'm
going to be from a broken home.

02:13.033 --> 02:14.559
Well, technically four broken homes

02:14.560 --> 02:16.482
if you count our vacation properties.

02:17.604 --> 02:19.253
I know what you're going through, bud.

02:19.254 --> 02:21.650
When my parents got
divorced, it was horrible.

02:21.651 --> 02:23.615
The constant shuttling back and forth,

02:23.616 --> 02:24.825
splitting holidays,

02:24.826 --> 02:27.034
never really knowing where to call home.

02:27.559 --> 02:29.197
You were 24.

02:30.373 --> 02:32.004
Hey, maybe I can talk to your dad.

02:32.005 --> 02:34.338
I'm sure whatever happened was his fault.

02:34.339 --> 02:36.256
I could certainly point
that out to him for you.

02:36.559 --> 02:38.218
I don't know. I mean, if someone's gonna

02:38.219 --> 02:40.042
give my dad advice about marriage,

02:40.043 --> 02:41.950
shouldn't it be someone who was good at it?

02:42.538 --> 02:44.125
Hey, I was brilliant at it.

02:44.542 --> 02:46.282
He was gay at it.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.677
Well, my mom says he's too uptight at it.

02:51.062 --> 02:52.456
Too uptight?

02:52.457 --> 02:54.967
Now that I could fix.

02:56.963 --> 02:58.093
That's a good idea.

02:58.622 --> 03:00.148
Dude, I can fix him.

03:00.149 --> 03:01.604
I just need to loosen him up a bit,

03:01.605 --> 03:04.676
and nobody is more laid back than me.

03:05.632 --> 03:07.347
Dude, would it kill you to use a coaster?

03:08.486 --> 03:11.285
Oh, and remember to scrub
that for a full 20 seconds

03:11.286 --> 03:12.933
using circular motions.

03:15.390 --> 03:16.832
He's hilarious.

03:16.833 --> 03:18.184
Like I'm gonna wash this.

03:19.565 --> 03:20.712
What are we gonna do?

03:20.713 --> 03:22.593
Tucker doesn't have a
laid back bone in his body.

03:22.594 --> 03:24.791
I know. He caught me reading his journal

03:24.792 --> 03:26.377
and he got all mad about it.

03:27.813 --> 03:29.800
Maybe you could go out with Mr. Dobbs.

03:29.801 --> 03:31.903
You know, loosen him
up. Show him a good time.

03:31.904 --> 03:35.218
Well, I think the no fun
police has plans of his own.

03:35.219 --> 03:36.606
It could be our little secret.

03:36.607 --> 03:39.240
Like your hair color and your real age.

03:40.325 --> 03:42.015
Good morning. Hey, mom,

03:42.016 --> 03:43.823
I was just flipping
through your old yearbook.

03:43.824 --> 03:46.988
I didn't know you were voted "most likely
to be a grandma before the age of 50."

03:47.397 --> 03:49.690
On behalf of Emma, you're welcome.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.954
See this. Ahh.

03:52.955 --> 03:53.726
Dated him,

03:54.554 --> 03:55.544
dated him,

03:56.131 --> 03:58.518
way more than dated him.

03:59.085 --> 04:01.503
God, we had some hot teachers at school.

04:02.153 --> 04:03.401
Where'd you get this?

04:03.402 --> 04:04.604
Uh, Riley left it here.

04:04.605 --> 04:06.481
She's trying to track
down her biological father.

04:06.482 --> 04:07.976
Oh, David Brinkerhoff?

04:07.977 --> 04:09.541
Uh, no. Mark Clements.

04:09.542 --> 04:10.549
Margot's old boyfriend.

04:10.550 --> 04:12.217
Oh, no no no. Mark and Margot

04:12.218 --> 04:13.535
may have been going steady,

04:13.536 --> 04:16.244
but Margot and David
were going all the way.

04:16.245 --> 04:17.428
Oh my God, really?

04:17.430 --> 04:19.673
I gotta go stop Riley from
calling the wrong guy daddy.

04:20.111 --> 04:23.298
But first, I gotta take care
of the girl who calls me daddy.

04:23.299 --> 04:26.172
Or at least she should be.
Seriously, it's not that hard.

04:26.173 --> 04:28.276
Da-da.
Da-da.

04:28.884 --> 04:30.276
Okay, I tried.

04:34.099 --> 04:35.327
Ben, hi.

04:35.328 --> 04:36.703
Oh, Riley. Good you're here.

04:36.704 --> 04:38.304
Sorry if I pulled you out of court.

04:38.305 --> 04:39.484
Oh, shoot.

04:39.485 --> 04:41.144
I knew I had something to do today.

04:42.058 --> 04:44.441
Sorry, I've just been so busy
working on my bio dad file.

04:44.442 --> 04:46.848
Everything there is to know
about Mark Clements is in here.

04:46.849 --> 04:47.958
Yeah, about that...

04:47.959 --> 04:50.077
Married twice, divorced once, two sons,

04:50.487 --> 04:53.434
so there's still an opening
for daddy's little girl.

04:53.435 --> 04:55.089
And oh, get this. Get this.

04:55.090 --> 04:58.557
He's a successful, high
powered, Manhattan attorney.

04:59.135 --> 05:01.017
Hello? Chip meet block.

05:02.037 --> 05:03.499
Or rush meet judgment.

05:04.232 --> 05:05.988
He was also a high school jock, me.

05:05.989 --> 05:07.907
President of his college debate club, me.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.737
And allergic to shellfish.

05:09.738 --> 05:11.240
Me me me.

05:11.241 --> 05:12.593
I'm so excited.

05:12.594 --> 05:14.708
Well, how would you like
to be twice as excited?

05:14.709 --> 05:16.486
- What do you mean?
- Well, according to my mom,

05:16.487 --> 05:17.681
there's a second contestant

05:17.682 --> 05:19.146
in this round of "who's your daddy?"

05:19.147 --> 05:20.928
His name's David Brinkerhoff.

05:20.929 --> 05:22.738
Oh my God. No.

05:22.739 --> 05:23.703
No no no no.

05:23.704 --> 05:26.327
I am absolutely positive
that Mark is my father.

05:26.788 --> 05:29.863
David is a pastry chef
and owns his own bakery.

05:30.369 --> 05:31.919
Oh my God, it might be him.

05:33.770 --> 05:35.432
What am I gonna do now?

05:35.433 --> 05:36.924
I have to start a whole new file.

05:37.401 --> 05:39.857
Or we could just go
check them out in person.

05:40.298 --> 05:42.951
Ben, I can't just walk
into some guy's bakery

05:42.952 --> 05:45.529
and be like "oh, hey. I'll
have two dozen cupcakes

05:45.530 --> 05:47.192
and some DNA."

05:47.845 --> 05:48.841
No.

05:48.842 --> 05:50.687
But an engaged couple from Yonkers

05:50.688 --> 05:53.655
who's looking for someone to
make their wedding cake can.

05:53.656 --> 05:55.851
Yeah, but where are we gonna
find a couple like that?

05:57.888 --> 05:59.099
Oh oh.

05:59.100 --> 06:00.465
- You mean us.
- Yeah.

06:00.466 --> 06:01.694
Oh, I like that. Okay.

06:03.000 --> 06:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:11.726 --> 06:12.852
Well...

06:12.853 --> 06:14.156
Thank you for a lovely evening.

06:14.851 --> 06:16.642
This really is the city that never sleeps.

06:17.226 --> 06:19.241
Especially not at 9:00 pm.

06:20.401 --> 06:22.985
Though it sure feels like
I pulled an all nighter.

06:23.803 --> 06:25.896
It's also the city where
everything you touch

06:25.897 --> 06:27.302
is just a little sticky.

06:27.670 --> 06:28.952
Ahh. Okay.

06:31.316 --> 06:33.277
- So, well?
- Well, nothing.

06:33.603 --> 06:36.188
He's tighter than the jeans
on the left side of my closet.

06:37.616 --> 06:39.224
Never say die.

06:39.589 --> 06:41.486
Look, honey, I tried. But there is no

06:41.487 --> 06:43.117
loosening up that lug nut.

06:43.118 --> 06:44.613
Night, Marshall.

06:44.614 --> 06:45.899
You're on your own.

06:49.299 --> 06:50.926
So, Mr. Dobbs.

06:50.927 --> 06:52.038
Daniel, I have to thank you.

06:52.039 --> 06:54.581
That was the best date I've
been on in thirty years.

06:55.950 --> 06:59.115
Whoo. Whoo.

07:00.215 --> 07:01.732
Um, date, what?

07:01.733 --> 07:03.648
I really appreciate you setting me up.

07:03.649 --> 07:05.475
Setting you up? I never set you up.

07:05.476 --> 07:07.440
- What about your wife?
- You mean the death star?

07:08.786 --> 07:09.992
She hates me.

07:09.993 --> 07:10.988
But that Bonnie,

07:11.479 --> 07:13.198
she makes me feel alive again.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.462
I mean, just look at me.

07:14.776 --> 07:16.450
I'm as giddy as a school boy.

07:18.034 --> 07:20.358
No no, you can't see my mom.

07:20.359 --> 07:21.390
What about Tucker?

07:22.174 --> 07:24.044
I didn't realize he had his eye on her too.

07:25.307 --> 07:27.440
No! No no no no. The divorce.

07:27.441 --> 07:29.736
I'm sure Tucker's not gonna
want to see you dating my mom.

07:30.100 --> 07:33.644
Oh. Well then, we should just
keep this between us for now.

07:33.645 --> 07:35.066
Hey, dad. I'm glad you're back.

07:35.067 --> 07:37.038
Listen, I thought we could
go on a little bar crawl

07:37.039 --> 07:39.119
and really get crazy, right?

07:40.557 --> 07:42.527
But we're gonna need
to be there before 9:15

07:42.528 --> 07:44.237
if we're gonna follow my itinerary.

07:45.708 --> 07:47.106
Now let's loosen up this tie.

07:47.107 --> 07:48.744
- Don't touch my tie, damn it.
- I'm sorry, sir.

07:54.215 --> 07:56.084
Oh my God, this is so weird.

07:56.085 --> 07:57.927
I mean, at first I was
positive it was Mark,

07:57.928 --> 08:00.098
but now I think it might actually be David.

08:00.099 --> 08:02.012
He's married, no kids,

08:02.013 --> 08:03.814
he has a dog named sprinkles.

08:03.815 --> 08:05.278
I love sprinkles.

08:05.279 --> 08:06.716
And like me, he may have had

08:06.717 --> 08:08.654
a slight weight problem in high school.

08:08.655 --> 08:09.558
Slight?

08:10.185 --> 08:11.415
May?

08:11.416 --> 08:12.734
Punch.

08:12.735 --> 08:14.030
Face.

08:14.425 --> 08:16.858
When he comes out here just
let me do the talking, okay?

08:16.859 --> 08:19.108
'Cause I have a whole list of
questions I want to ask him.

08:19.109 --> 08:20.766
Oh, hi. I'm David.

08:20.767 --> 08:22.391
Care to sample my new crapnut?

08:31.021 --> 08:32.538
Uh, hi. I'm Ben Wheeler.

08:32.539 --> 08:33.808
We called yesterday.

08:33.808 --> 08:35.191
Wheeler? I went to high school

08:35.192 --> 08:36.863
with a guy named Ray Wheeler.

08:36.864 --> 08:38.918
Used to beat the crap out of me every day,

08:38.919 --> 08:40.409
but he knocked up some bimbo,

08:40.409 --> 08:42.496
so I guess the joke's on him, right?

08:43.304 --> 08:44.094
Right.

08:44.503 --> 08:46.210
Well, this is my lovely bride to be,

08:46.211 --> 08:48.547
Riley, who just has a
few questions for you.

08:48.957 --> 08:50.283
Right, Riley?

08:51.754 --> 08:53.004
Yeah.

08:53.005 --> 08:54.792
Yeah, I was just wondering if you had...

09:00.647 --> 09:01.675
Okay, um,

09:02.208 --> 09:04.939
do you have a peanut butter
cake with marshmallow frosting?

09:04.940 --> 09:06.156
It's her favorite.

09:06.157 --> 09:07.548
Get out.

09:08.109 --> 09:10.327
That's my favorite too.

09:10.655 --> 09:12.226
I'll grab you guys some samples.

09:13.607 --> 09:14.890
- Oh my God.
- What's the matter with you?

09:14.891 --> 09:16.359
- I think it's him.
- I can't do this.

09:16.727 --> 09:17.822
I am too nervous.

09:17.823 --> 09:19.037
I mean, it's too real.

09:19.615 --> 09:20.992
What if he is my dad?

09:20.993 --> 09:22.789
Oh my God, these are good.

09:23.629 --> 09:25.689
Here. Will you just
ask him these questions?

09:26.097 --> 09:27.329
I'm sorry. I got to get out of here.

09:27.330 --> 09:29.576
Riley, wait. What are you... come on!

09:29.577 --> 09:30.765
Is everything okay?

09:30.766 --> 09:33.138
Yeah, ironically she just remembered

09:33.139 --> 09:34.614
that she left a cake in the oven.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.721
Aww, a girl after my own heart.

09:36.722 --> 09:38.664
You know, she reminds
me of my little sister.

09:41.072 --> 09:42.444
Or your daughter?

09:42.445 --> 09:44.301
- I don't have one.
- But what if you did?

09:44.302 --> 09:45.606
But I don't.

09:45.607 --> 09:47.127
Well, you do now.

09:48.358 --> 09:50.096
- You mean, she's my...
- Yep.

09:55.554 --> 09:56.943
What is wrong with you?

09:56.944 --> 09:58.174
You were supposed to loosen him up,

09:58.175 --> 09:59.635
not make him fall in love with you.

10:00.389 --> 10:02.189
It's not my fault.

10:02.190 --> 10:03.359
It's a curse.

10:05.133 --> 10:06.796
Men love me.

10:07.960 --> 10:10.473
Honestly, I should come
with a warning label.

10:13.175 --> 10:15.218
Listen, honey, maybe you misunderstood.

10:15.219 --> 10:16.494
Maybe you're wrong.

10:21.753 --> 10:22.921
Bonnie.

10:28.067 --> 10:29.328
You're not wrong.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.326
Oh, damn. I'm good.

10:32.238 --> 10:33.844
All right, well, what am I supposed to do?

10:33.845 --> 10:35.447
Tell him to go away.

10:35.448 --> 10:37.118
No. Wait.

10:37.119 --> 10:38.678
Get him to stop liking you.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.059
Do whatever you did to dad.

10:41.758 --> 10:44.355
For the last time, I did not make him gay.

10:44.356 --> 10:45.898
He came that way!

10:47.845 --> 10:49.235
<i>Maybe this is a mistake.</i>

10:49.236 --> 10:50.605
I shouldn't even be here.

10:50.606 --> 10:52.187
I mean, me with a kid?

10:52.188 --> 10:53.693
I never wanted one of those.

10:55.397 --> 10:57.138
What am I supposed to say to her?

10:57.139 --> 10:58.580
Probably none of that.

10:59.650 --> 11:01.390
But how about you let me
do most of the talking?

11:01.391 --> 11:02.325
Okay.

11:02.326 --> 11:03.673
I can't believe Margot never told me

11:03.674 --> 11:04.787
she was pregnant.

11:05.101 --> 11:07.856
I wasn't even sure we
were really doing it right.

11:08.961 --> 11:10.505
You know, Riley's gonna be here any minute.

11:10.506 --> 11:12.341
So why don't you go out on the fire escape

11:12.342 --> 11:14.829
while I try to make her
believe this was all her idea.

11:14.830 --> 11:16.428
Knock knock. Look, I know...

11:16.800 --> 11:18.308
<i>I know what you're gonna say.</i>

11:18.309 --> 11:19.669
And you are right, okay?

11:19.670 --> 11:21.415
I'm being silly, and I started this thing,

11:21.416 --> 11:22.730
so I need to finish it.

11:22.731 --> 11:25.875
And I do. I want to know
who my biological father is.

11:25.876 --> 11:27.336
Oh my God. I'm so glad you said that.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.630
Which is why I called Mark
and asked him to meet me here.

11:30.124 --> 11:31.806
Mark? The lawyer, here?

11:32.230 --> 11:34.340
I told him there's a newly
engaged couple from Yonkers,

11:34.341 --> 11:35.590
and they want to sign a prenup.

11:35.591 --> 11:36.868
Where are we gonna find a couple like that?

11:37.787 --> 11:38.910
Oh, you mean us.

11:41.110 --> 11:42.527
Hi, Mark Clements.

11:42.528 --> 11:45.247
I'm looking for a Riley Jemima?

11:49.492 --> 11:50.766
I was having pancakes.

11:52.436 --> 11:53.489
Yes, hi.

11:53.915 --> 11:55.899
I'm Riley. Come on in, come on in.

11:55.900 --> 11:57.125
Actually, why don't we go outside?

11:57.126 --> 11:58.663
I got a sleeping baby. Water?

11:58.664 --> 11:59.848
There you go. Okay.

12:02.188 --> 12:03.509
Hey, Danny,

12:03.510 --> 12:05.195
do you know what happened to my dad?

12:05.196 --> 12:06.562
I've called him like three times

12:06.563 --> 12:07.995
and I still haven't heard back.

12:09.044 --> 12:10.545
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.373
No, I haven't seen him.

12:17.374 --> 12:19.001
But I'll let you know the moment I do.

12:19.002 --> 12:20.082
Cool.

12:20.398 --> 12:21.659
Hey, mom. How'd it go with...

12:21.660 --> 12:23.268
- oh, God, Danny!
- Mom!

12:23.269 --> 12:24.549
<i>Mr. Dobbs!</i>

12:32.563 --> 12:33.533
So, Daniel.

12:34.303 --> 12:35.824
I understand you're a hockey player.

12:38.297 --> 12:39.704
So, before your wedding,

12:39.705 --> 12:41.693
you want to sign a prenuptial agreement.

12:41.694 --> 12:44.882
Even though neither one
of you has any assets.

12:45.798 --> 12:47.089
Well, I just want to make sure

12:47.090 --> 12:48.619
that if we ever split up,

12:48.620 --> 12:50.142
he doesn't try to take half.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.376
Of nothing?

12:53.800 --> 12:55.014
Exactly.

12:55.607 --> 12:57.447
So... so I was wondering,

12:57.448 --> 13:00.138
when did you decide that you
wanted to become a lawyer?

13:00.139 --> 13:03.071
Because you know, I'm one too.

13:03.072 --> 13:05.452
Oh, well then I guess the
next logical question is

13:05.826 --> 13:07.397
why am I here?

13:09.657 --> 13:11.232
She's not very good.

13:12.389 --> 13:14.168
I bet that's not true.

13:14.169 --> 13:17.158
You know, I give myself a pep
talk every morning in the mirror.

13:17.159 --> 13:19.029
"You're tough, you're rough,

13:19.030 --> 13:21.131
and damn, you look good in the buff."

13:22.743 --> 13:24.347
I do it when I get out of the shower.

13:25.501 --> 13:27.005
That's even better than mine.

13:27.416 --> 13:29.426
"Don't cry at the office today."

13:31.435 --> 13:33.083
Oh, Ben. I need to speak to you.

13:33.084 --> 13:34.365
But Riley and I are in the middle of...

13:34.366 --> 13:35.237
- now.
- No, but, dude...

13:35.238 --> 13:36.390
excuse us.

13:38.606 --> 13:39.949
And I think I'm out of here.

13:39.950 --> 13:41.334
Oh, no. You can't go yet.

13:41.335 --> 13:42.907
Give me one good reason why not.

13:46.657 --> 13:49.064
Because I think I'm your daughter.

13:55.440 --> 13:56.472
They were what?!

13:56.882 --> 13:59.808
I know. It's exactly like the
time I walked in on mom and dad.

14:00.374 --> 14:02.304
I could never play twister again.

14:03.760 --> 14:04.572
Okay.

14:04.573 --> 14:06.832
Well, we have to make sure
Tucker never finds out. Tucker!

14:06.833 --> 14:08.022
Hey, guys. First of all,

14:08.023 --> 14:09.771
did y'all know that there
was a funny little man

14:09.772 --> 14:11.747
who smells like doughnuts
out on the fire escape?

14:12.977 --> 14:15.664
Oh, and Danny, I think you were right.

14:15.665 --> 14:18.041
I think I'm gonna ask
your mom to talk to my dad.

14:18.042 --> 14:19.521
Our mom talk to your dad?

14:19.522 --> 14:20.971
- Now, you can't.
- Why not?

14:20.972 --> 14:24.059
Because she's with Emma at the park.

14:24.060 --> 14:25.260
I've gotta go meet them. Bye.

14:25.588 --> 14:26.801
They could be gone for hours.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.333
Wait, isn't that Emma?

14:31.135 --> 14:32.203
Is it?

14:34.177 --> 14:35.963
Way to keep track of your baby, dude.

14:37.620 --> 14:39.063
Oh my God, Ben. It's him.

14:39.064 --> 14:40.498
I just... I just know it is.

14:40.499 --> 14:42.197
Really? 'Cause I had my money on David.

14:42.198 --> 14:43.764
Hey. You can't just tell
a guy he's your father

14:43.765 --> 14:45.038
and leave him standing there.

14:45.039 --> 14:46.671
Oh my God, Riley. What are you doing?

14:46.672 --> 14:47.948
You're so irresponsible.

14:47.949 --> 14:50.121
Any chance we can cut to the dad stuff?

14:50.510 --> 14:51.498
David.

14:51.880 --> 14:53.936
Oh my God. You brought him in here too?

14:55.033 --> 14:56.569
Well that really is irresponsible.

14:58.490 --> 14:59.999
What the hell is going on here?

15:00.495 --> 15:01.671
I can explain.

15:02.399 --> 15:03.953
Ben, you want to jump in here?

15:05.214 --> 15:06.627
Mark Clements?

15:06.628 --> 15:08.458
David Brinkerhoff.

15:08.459 --> 15:10.427
Looks like you finally
got out of that locker.

15:11.602 --> 15:14.471
Apparently just in time for
you to sell me a used car.

15:16.609 --> 15:17.937
What's he doing here?

15:17.938 --> 15:20.490
I was just told that I had
a kid with Margot Davis.

15:20.491 --> 15:21.503
You and Margot?

15:21.843 --> 15:23.581
I thought you said I was her father.

15:23.582 --> 15:24.768
How could you be her father?

15:24.769 --> 15:26.165
Margot was my girlfriend.

15:26.166 --> 15:28.636
Not in the back of my pinto, she wasn't.

15:31.212 --> 15:33.526
Oh, Margot would have never
cheated on me with you.

15:33.527 --> 15:35.183
Why, 'cause I was fat in high school?

15:35.184 --> 15:36.735
Yeah, pretty much. It wasn't easy

15:36.736 --> 15:38.463
shoving you in that locker.

15:38.464 --> 15:39.960
Oh, try it now, pretty boy.

15:39.961 --> 15:41.537
Oh oh, whoa!

15:41.538 --> 15:43.807
Okay, okay. I think we're
kind of missing the point here.

15:43.808 --> 15:44.689
Yes yes.

15:44.690 --> 15:45.772
One of you is the lucky winner

15:45.773 --> 15:47.763
of this beautiful, fully grown daughter.

15:50.007 --> 15:52.899
Yeah, well, not without a
DNA test and a court order.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.091
I don't know what the
two of you are pulling,

15:55.441 --> 15:56.864
but I've had enough.

15:56.865 --> 15:58.326
You know what? Me too.

15:58.667 --> 15:59.832
And to think,

15:59.833 --> 16:02.360
I was gonna rename the crapnut after you.

16:03.652 --> 16:04.991
wait. Wait wait wait...

16:06.900 --> 16:09.093
You know what the craziest
part of this whole thing is?

16:09.412 --> 16:11.787
You may have been conceived
in the back of a pinto.

16:15.220 --> 16:16.224
Knock knock.

16:17.605 --> 16:18.874
<i>Mom!</i>

16:18.875 --> 16:20.566
I got you that robe for Christmas.

16:22.212 --> 16:24.475
Daniel, forgive me for having
relations with your mother.

16:25.900 --> 16:27.272
I feel horrible about it.

16:28.520 --> 16:29.933
And I may need to be punished.

16:29.934 --> 16:32.116
Oh, you're so bad. You're so bad.

16:32.117 --> 16:34.114
Thanks for the apology, but
I'm a little more worried

16:34.115 --> 16:35.671
about what you're gonna say to Tucker.

16:35.672 --> 16:37.317
Well, we will discuss this maturely

16:37.740 --> 16:39.085
and face it head on.

16:39.086 --> 16:40.454
<i>Mrs. Wheeler?</i>

16:40.455 --> 16:41.175
Hide me!

16:41.979 --> 16:43.468
Just a minute. Just a minute.

16:51.337 --> 16:52.448
Come in.

16:53.067 --> 16:54.099
Hey, Mrs. Wheeler.

16:54.646 --> 16:55.872
Wow.

16:55.873 --> 16:58.584
You really do sit around
in your robe all day.

16:59.240 --> 17:00.660
Ha! That's funny.

17:01.053 --> 17:03.186
Good visit. All right,
thanks for stopping by.

17:03.187 --> 17:04.162
I need your help.

17:04.902 --> 17:06.180
I don't know what to do.

17:06.553 --> 17:08.463
I feel like my family's falling apart,

17:08.464 --> 17:09.392
and if that happens,

17:10.394 --> 17:12.127
Mrs. Wheeler, I'll be lost.

17:15.069 --> 17:16.484
Poor little Tuck-Tuck.

17:18.556 --> 17:20.680
I really feel for you.

17:21.496 --> 17:23.064
But you know what? Now is
not a good time, alright?

17:23.065 --> 17:25.488
So perhaps I could call you tomorrow,

17:25.821 --> 17:28.011
or better yet, you know,
I'll email you, okay?

17:28.012 --> 17:29.633
- Bye bye bye bye bye.
- Wait, Mrs. Wheeler...

17:30.942 --> 17:32.143
I feel horrible.

17:32.879 --> 17:34.214
I don't think I really thought about

17:34.215 --> 17:36.366
how that divorce might affect Tucker.

17:36.367 --> 17:37.539
Mrs. Wheeler, I just don't...

17:41.620 --> 17:43.006
Hey, Tuck.

17:43.311 --> 17:45.306
I found your dad. He was in the closet.

17:46.841 --> 17:48.788
But not the same one my dad was in.

17:53.739 --> 17:54.875
Tucker!

17:57.176 --> 17:58.458
Tucker, stop!

17:58.459 --> 18:00.376
- You have to talk to me.
- No, I don't.

18:00.377 --> 18:02.948
Tucker Thurgood Marshall
Dobbs, get out here.

18:02.949 --> 18:04.277
You can't hide from me forever.

18:04.278 --> 18:06.035
<i>- Yes, I can!
- I got this.</i>

18:06.342 --> 18:08.279
<i>Wait. No no no. No no no no no.</i>

18:08.280 --> 18:10.127
<i>What are you doing? Stop. Stop it.</i>

18:11.212 --> 18:12.288
Stop it!

18:15.699 --> 18:17.631
I have nothing to say to him.

18:17.632 --> 18:18.867
Well, I've got plenty to say to you.

18:18.868 --> 18:20.383
Oh, actually I've got
plenty to say to you too.

18:20.384 --> 18:21.438
Turn me around.

18:22.593 --> 18:23.961
Tucker, this isn't about you.

18:24.266 --> 18:26.795
I'm a grown man, and I
deserve some happiness.

18:26.796 --> 18:28.586
And that crazy woman makes you happy?

18:29.728 --> 18:31.443
Honestly, whether or
not Bonnie rocks my world

18:31.768 --> 18:33.037
isn't any of your business.

18:33.901 --> 18:35.087
Put me down.

18:37.002 --> 18:38.425
Tucker, one day you're gonna learn

18:38.426 --> 18:39.640
that the goal of raising a family

18:39.641 --> 18:41.275
takes precedence over your own happiness.

18:42.094 --> 18:43.238
But when the hard part is over

18:43.239 --> 18:44.611
and the kids are grown,

18:44.612 --> 18:45.834
you wake up one morning and you say

18:46.399 --> 18:48.004
"who is this woman next to me?

18:48.396 --> 18:50.018
And why does she hate me so much?"

18:52.012 --> 18:53.973
I had no idea you were so unhappy.

18:53.974 --> 18:55.160
Well, I was never willing to admit it

18:55.161 --> 18:57.193
until I saw you following your dreams.

18:57.194 --> 18:58.628
So you're saying this is my fault?

18:59.660 --> 19:01.914
No, I'm saying I have you to thank.

19:02.911 --> 19:06.720
And I'm asking you to
let my find my own way.

19:09.011 --> 19:11.413
Well, as long you can find
your way out of that robe,

19:11.414 --> 19:12.835
I think I'm cool.

19:14.430 --> 19:16.074
No no no. Not that cool.

19:20.289 --> 19:21.536
Hey.

19:21.537 --> 19:23.473
Ben, I so appreciate you calling,

19:23.474 --> 19:24.608
but I'm fine.

19:24.980 --> 19:27.379
Two boxes of tissues
and four pounds of cake

19:27.380 --> 19:28.494
might say otherwise,

19:28.495 --> 19:30.111
but I'm fine.

19:30.463 --> 19:32.440
Riley, I'm really sorry
about how all this happened.

19:32.441 --> 19:33.797
Don't be. It's my fault.

19:33.798 --> 19:34.999
I didn't handle it right.

19:35.383 --> 19:38.152
I don't even know what to say to them.

19:38.641 --> 19:42.148
Well, it might be easier if you
knew who you had to say it to.

19:42.796 --> 19:43.957
What's this?

19:43.958 --> 19:45.424
The results of a DNA test.

19:45.425 --> 19:47.641
I sent in the water glasses
they both used the other day,

19:47.642 --> 19:50.253
and I may or may not have
stolen your toothbrush.

19:51.117 --> 19:52.013
Ben...

19:52.863 --> 19:54.197
I thought I wanted to know,

19:54.198 --> 19:57.143
but I realized I was only
considering my feelings.

19:57.144 --> 19:59.792
I didn't even stop to think
about how this would affect them.

20:00.183 --> 20:01.179
And besides,

20:01.647 --> 20:03.652
I already have a really great dad.

20:05.482 --> 20:07.462
But don't you want to know who he is?

20:07.463 --> 20:08.818
How you came to be you?

20:09.121 --> 20:11.255
Why you have giant feet and tiny hands?

20:12.725 --> 20:14.879
This could be the greatest thing
that's ever happened to you.

20:16.915 --> 20:18.232
He's here, isn't he?

20:18.825 --> 20:19.957
Pretty much.

20:25.621 --> 20:26.771
Hi.

20:28.166 --> 20:29.445
I'm Riley.

20:30.223 --> 20:31.296
Your daughter.

20:45.536 --> 20:47.202
Tucker. What brings you by?

20:47.203 --> 20:49.481
Mrs. Wheeler, I just wanted to thank you

20:49.482 --> 20:51.203
for everything that you've done.

20:51.204 --> 20:52.621
Ah ha!

20:53.570 --> 20:57.388
I know that you and my father
weren't trying to hurt anyone.

20:57.389 --> 20:59.553
In fact, I think you helped him.

20:59.554 --> 21:00.599
Gotcha!

21:02.087 --> 21:03.404
All right.

21:03.405 --> 21:04.903
Well, have a good night, Mrs. Wheeler.

21:04.904 --> 21:06.135
And remember...

21:06.136 --> 21:08.553
I can stop by anytime.

21:08.554 --> 21:10.523
You are always more than welcome.

21:10.524 --> 21:11.629
Okay.

21:13.726 --> 21:15.016
I thought he'd never leave.
