WEBVTT

00:05.400 --> 00:06.867
[DING]

00:13.000 --> 00:16.200
IT'S ME, NOT YOU,
BACK FROM PERU.

00:17.700 --> 00:20.367
WHAT, DID YOU BUY
ALL OF SOUTH AMERICA?

00:20.367 --> 00:22.400
NO, SILLY.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.200
JUST THE SHINY STUFF.

00:25.734 --> 00:26.800
OHH.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.300
WHOA! IS THAT REAL GOLD?

00:29.300 --> 00:31.600
DON'T TOUCH!

00:31.600 --> 00:33.600
THIS LOOKS
LIKE A GENUINE,
PRE-COLUMBIAN

00:33.600 --> 00:36.500
ARTIFACT FROM THE
MEZOIAN AMERICAN
CIVILIZATION.

00:36.500 --> 00:41.000
I WOULD
SAY IT DATED
CIRCA 3000 B.C.

00:42.200 --> 00:46.600
IT'S REALLY OLD.

00:46.600 --> 00:47.700
OH! OOH!

00:47.700 --> 00:50.200
AND I GOT THIS
PRETTY NECKLACE, TOO.

00:50.200 --> 00:53.033
IS THAT
A REAL EMERALD?

00:54.500 --> 00:57.300
WHAT IS THIS,
SLAP ZACK DAY?

00:57.300 --> 01:02.033
LONDON, YOU CAN'T JUST
STEAL ANOTHER COUNTRY'S
CULTURAL ARTIFACTS.

01:02.033 --> 01:03.500
DADDY DIDN'T STEAL THEM.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.667
HE BOUGHT THEM FROM
A GUY NAMED DAKOTA SMITH.

01:05.667 --> 01:07.667
HE DELIVERED THEM
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

01:07.667 --> 01:09.667
AND THEN WE LEFT
REALLY, REALLY FAST
ON A JET.

01:09.667 --> 01:11.300
I BARELY MADE IT
UP THE STEPS.

01:11.300 --> 01:14.233
WELL, AS LONG AS
THEY WEREN'T STOLEN.

01:14.233 --> 01:16.300
AND NOW DADDY'S
GOING TO DISPLAY

01:16.300 --> 01:19.100
ALL THE TREASURES
OF THE PYRAMID RIGHT
HERE AT THE TIPTON.

01:19.100 --> 01:21.400
OOH! MAY I PRESENT
THE MAIN ATTRACTION?

01:21.400 --> 01:23.233
QUEEN QUIQUI QUMQUM.

01:23.233 --> 01:26.467
AAH! THE CURSE
OF THE MUMMY!

01:26.467 --> 01:27.467
OOH!

01:27.467 --> 01:28.567
WHAT CURSE?

01:28.567 --> 01:30.900
THE CURSE
OF QUEEN QUIQUI!

01:30.900 --> 01:32.567
ANYONE WHO DISTURBS
HER REST

01:32.567 --> 01:35.133
SHALL BE DOOMED
FOREVER.

01:35.133 --> 01:37.000
AH!

01:37.000 --> 01:39.300
OH, WAIT. HOW DO
YOU KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT THIS?

01:39.300 --> 01:40.734
OH. COME HERE,
COME HERE, COME HERE.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.934
MY VILLAGE
LIES IN THE SHADOW

01:42.934 --> 01:45.133
OF QUEEN QUIQUI'S
PYRAMID.

01:45.133 --> 01:47.934
BUT IT LOOKED LIKE NO ONE
HAD BEEN NEAR THERE
FOR A THOUSAND YEARS.

01:47.934 --> 01:52.233
RIGHT. BECAUSE AS I MAY
HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE,

01:52.233 --> 01:53.700
IT'S CURSED!

01:53.700 --> 01:57.000
ONLY A COMPLETE IDIOT
WOULD GO THERE!

01:59.100 --> 02:01.133
HI.

02:01.133 --> 02:04.834
THE ONLY THING
WORSE THAN DISTURBING
QUEEN QUIQUI'S REST

02:04.834 --> 02:07.934
IS IF SOMEONE STOLE
HER PRECIOUS EMERALDS.

02:10.600 --> 02:14.834
AAH! THE CURSE
OF THE NECKLACE!

02:14.834 --> 02:15.834
AAH!

02:15.834 --> 02:17.934
BOY, THEY GOT
A LOT OF CURSES.

03:07.400 --> 03:10.033

03:15.300 --> 03:18.033

03:18.033 --> 03:19.867
OOH.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.667
MAYBE LATER.

03:22.900 --> 03:25.567
ALTHOUGH I WILL BE AWAY
AT A WEDDING THIS WEEKEND,

03:25.567 --> 03:28.700
I ASSURE YOU, YOUR EXHIBIT
WILL BE COMPLETELY SAFE.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.500
I HAVE PUT
MY BEST MAN IN CHARGE.

03:30.500 --> 03:31.767
SKIPPY!

03:32.700 --> 03:34.200
OOH, MY!

03:34.200 --> 03:36.100
YES, SIR?

03:36.100 --> 03:38.367
THIS IS YOUR BEST MAN?

03:38.367 --> 03:41.000
ACTUALLY, MY BEST MAN
IS GETTING MARRIED.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.700
MY SECOND BEST MAN
IS OUT SICK,

03:42.700 --> 03:44.367
AND MY THIRD BEST MAN
IS THE BEST MAN

03:44.367 --> 03:46.133
AT MY FIRST
BEST MAN'S WEDDING.

03:46.133 --> 03:48.233
SO TECHNICALLY,
HE'S MY FOURTH BEST MAN.

03:48.233 --> 03:49.567
OH, SHUCKS.

03:49.567 --> 03:50.600
I'M FLATTERED.

03:50.600 --> 03:53.233
OHH!

03:53.233 --> 03:58.200
PERHAPS I SHALL KEEP
OUR MOST VALUABLE ITEM
LOCKED IN MY ROOM.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.200
I WOULD.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.467
TAKE THE QUEEN.

04:01.467 --> 04:02.667
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

04:02.667 --> 04:04.900
HERE. HAVE A QUEEN
QUIQUI HAT.

04:04.900 --> 04:06.367
OOH!

04:06.367 --> 04:08.700
COOL!

04:16.367 --> 04:17.467
THANK YOU.

04:17.467 --> 04:20.467
IT'LL GO WITH MY
I'M WITH STUPID T-SHIRT.

04:21.367 --> 04:24.233
WHICH I SHOULD BE
WEARING RIGHT NOW.

04:25.567 --> 04:28.000
WHILE I AM AWAY
I WANT NOTHING TO HAPPEN
TO THIS EXHIBIT.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
AND BY NOTHING,
KEEP ZACK AND CODY OUT.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.033
DON'T WORRY, SIR.

04:32.033 --> 04:33.400
THEY WON'T GET BY ME.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.767
I AM
AN IMPENETRABLE WALL.

04:35.767 --> 04:36.767
HEY, SKIPPY.

04:36.767 --> 04:37.967
YO, SKIP.

04:39.100 --> 04:41.367
HEY, GUYS!

04:41.367 --> 04:43.400
OH, AREN'T THEY
THE CUTEST KIDS?

04:43.400 --> 04:45.367
SHOW ME THE MUMMY!

04:45.367 --> 04:48.867
I WILL SHOW YOU THE DOOR!

04:48.867 --> 04:51.300
NOW, CONSIDER THIS
YOUR FIRST AND LAST WARNING.

04:51.300 --> 04:53.400
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED
IN THIS ROOM EVER.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.600
BUT WE JUST WANT TO TAKE
A PEEK AT THE MUMMY.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.667
THERE WILL BE NO MUMMY
PEEKING IN THIS ROOM.

04:57.667 --> 05:00.734
THAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE
IT'S GOING TO BE
IN DAKOTA SMITH'S ROOM.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.233
MMM!

05:02.233 --> 05:05.200
OH, I GUESS I SHOULDN'T
HAVE TOLD THEM THAT, HUH?

05:05.200 --> 05:06.734
YOU THINK?

05:06.734 --> 05:09.600
Crowd: SEND THE MUMMY HOME!

05:09.600 --> 05:11.400
SEND THE MUMMY HOME!

05:11.400 --> 05:13.367
SEND THE MUMMY HOME!

05:13.367 --> 05:14.967
HEY, LADY!

05:14.967 --> 05:16.400
IF YOU WANT
TO PROTEST SOMETHING,

05:16.400 --> 05:19.667
YOU SHOULD PROTEST THAT
OUTFIT. IT'S HIDEOUS.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.033
OH, MISS LONDON!

05:21.033 --> 05:22.767
QUEEN QUIQUI MUST GO HOME,

05:22.767 --> 05:24.233
OR SHE WILL PUNISH US ALL.

05:24.233 --> 05:26.300
ESTEBAN,
STOP BEING RIDICULOUS,

05:26.300 --> 05:28.100
AND TAKE OFF
THAT SILLY HAT.

05:28.100 --> 05:30.700
THIS IS MY HAT OF PROTECTION.

05:31.567 --> 05:34.400
THE GARLIC KEEPS AWAY
THE DEAD.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.567
IT DOES A GOOD JOB
ON THE LIVING, TOO.

05:36.567 --> 05:39.033
OH! OH, POOR MADDIE.

05:39.033 --> 05:41.500
THE EVIL PROTESTORS
TRAMPLED YOU, TOO.

05:41.500 --> 05:44.200
LOOK WHAT THEY DID
TO YOUR HAIR.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.734
THEY DIDN'T TOUCH MY HAIR.

05:46.734 --> 05:49.800
OH. NEVER MIND.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.300
ANYWAY, I COMPLETELY
AGREE WITH THEM.

05:52.300 --> 05:54.100
QUEEN QUIQUI MUST GO HOME.

05:54.100 --> 05:57.133
OH, MADDIE, YOU, TOO,
BELIEVE THIS WRONG
SHOULD BE RIGHTED.

05:57.133 --> 06:00.400
YES. I JUST MET THE AMBASSADOR
FROM QUMQUM OUTSIDE.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.400
AND HE'S VERY UPSET.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.233
PEPE'S OUT THERE?

06:04.233 --> 06:06.500
HE'S THE ONE
IN THE GARLIC PANTS.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.200
HE OWES ME $10.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.834
LONDON, EVERYTHING
SHOULD GO BACK TO QUMQUM,

06:10.834 --> 06:12.734
INCLUDING THAT NECKLACE.

06:12.734 --> 06:15.100
IT'S A PRICELESS
CULTURAL ARTIFACT.

06:15.100 --> 06:18.033
A PRECIOUS REMNANT OF
A ONCE GREAT CIVILIZATION.

06:18.033 --> 06:21.467
YEAH, BUT IT GOES
GREAT WITH MY NEW BOOTS.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.400
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.767
MOSEBY WON'T LET US IN

06:24.767 --> 06:26.900
TO SEE THEM
SET UP THE EXHIBIT

06:26.900 --> 06:29.567
BECAUSE HE'S AFRAID
WE'LL BREAK SOMETHING.

06:29.567 --> 06:32.000
WELL, YOU DID
BREAK THE CHANDELIER
IN THE BALLROOM

06:32.000 --> 06:33.500
AND THE VENT
IN THE LOUNGE

06:33.500 --> 06:34.934
AND THAT STATUE
IN THE ATRIUM AND...

06:34.934 --> 06:36.667
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

06:36.667 --> 06:38.300
BOYS, ONCE
THE EXHIBIT IS OPEN,

06:38.300 --> 06:40.233
YOU CAN
GO SEE IT JUST
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.400
IT COSTS 32.50 PER PERSON.

06:43.400 --> 06:46.033
OR YOU CAN READ ALL
ABOUT IT IN THE PAPERS.

06:54.300 --> 06:55.700
OHH.

06:57.367 --> 06:59.300
ESTEBAN, GET IN HERE.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.100
BUT I'M AFRAID
TO SEE THE MUMMY.

07:02.100 --> 07:03.000
UHH!

07:03.000 --> 07:05.100
THE MUMMY ISN'T
DOWN HERE.

07:05.100 --> 07:07.767
NOW, OPEN YOUR EYES.

07:07.767 --> 07:10.900
AAH!

07:10.900 --> 07:12.000
WOULD YOU RELAX?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.567
IT'S JUST
MY OLD DOLLY HOLLY.

07:14.567 --> 07:17.600
WELL, THEY SHOULD'VE
CALLED HER SCARY MARY.

07:18.934 --> 07:20.600
OK. SO...

07:20.600 --> 07:22.600
HOW IS HOLLY THE DOLLY
GOING TO HELP US

07:22.600 --> 07:24.200
THE MUMMY BACK HOME?

07:24.200 --> 07:26.233
WE JUST HAVE
TO WRAP HER UP IN THIS,

07:26.233 --> 07:28.300
PUT HER IN A CRATE
TO GET HER BY SKIPPY,

07:28.300 --> 07:30.000
THEN SWITCH HER
WITH THE REAL MUMMY,

07:30.000 --> 07:31.400
WHICH WE'LL
BRING DOWN HERE

07:31.400 --> 07:32.667
AND DELIVER
TO AMBASSADOR PEPE.

07:32.667 --> 07:35.867
HE'S GOING
BACK TO QUMQUM FOR
THE IGUANA FESTIVAL.

07:35.867 --> 07:36.867
HE IS?

07:36.867 --> 07:40.600
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I MISSED IT AGAIN.

07:40.600 --> 07:43.033
I LOVE THE RUNNING
OF THE IGUANAS.

07:43.033 --> 07:45.367
THE RUNNING
OF THE IGUANAS?

07:45.367 --> 07:47.100
WE USED TO HAVE THE RUNNING
OF THE CHAMELEONS,

07:47.100 --> 07:49.200
BUT NO ONE CAN
EVER SEE THEM.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.400
HELP ME FOCUS HERE!

07:50.400 --> 07:51.600
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.367
WE MUST RETURN
QUEEN QUIQUI BACK HOME

07:53.367 --> 07:54.767
BEFORE WE ARE CURSED.

07:54.767 --> 07:56.133
BY THE WAY,

07:56.133 --> 07:59.200
WHAT EXACTLY DOES
THIS CURSE DO TO YOU?

07:59.200 --> 08:01.200
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
YOU SPEND YOUR LIFE

08:01.200 --> 08:03.000
IN AGONIZING TOIL
AND POVERTY.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.667
I GOT THAT NOW.

08:05.667 --> 08:06.934
AND YOUR SKIN MELTS OFF,

08:06.934 --> 08:09.000
YOUR EYES EXPLODE,
AND YOUR HAIR BURSTS
INTO FLAMES.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.700
OOH.

08:10.700 --> 08:13.800
OH, THAT WOULD SO
PUT A DAMPER ON PROM.

08:13.800 --> 08:14.800
OK.

08:14.800 --> 08:15.800
HURRY UP.

08:15.800 --> 08:16.967
OK, OK.

08:18.467 --> 08:21.033
ZACK, I DON'T KNOW.

08:21.033 --> 08:24.367
DON'T WORRY.
DAKOTA'S DOWNSTAIRS
DUSTING HIS PYRAMID.

08:24.367 --> 08:25.800
COME ON.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.000
HOW DID YOU GET
THAT PASS KEY?

08:28.000 --> 08:29.467
I JUST ASKED
SKIPPY FOR HIS.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.800
HE'LL GIVE YOU ANYTHING
IF YOU ASK FOR IT.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.000
I EVEN GOT HIS WALLET.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.500
THERE SHE IS!

08:34.500 --> 08:37.200
WOW! THAT IS SO COOL!

08:37.200 --> 08:38.800
NICE TO MEET YOU,
QUEEN QUIQUI!

08:38.800 --> 08:40.400
STOP! DON'T TOUCH.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.100
SHE MIGHTY FALL
TO PIECES.

08:42.100 --> 08:44.000
YEAH, I DO HAVE
THAT EFFECT ON WOMEN.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
YEAH, WHEN YOU'RE NOT
WEARING DEODORANT.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.100
OH, YEAH? IF YOU'RE
SUCH A LADY'S MAN,

08:49.100 --> 08:50.967
WHY DON'T YOU GO
GIVE HER A KISS?

08:50.967 --> 08:52.367
QUIT PUSHING!

08:52.367 --> 08:54.000
WHY, ARE YOU
GOING TO CRY?

08:54.000 --> 08:55.200
OOH!

09:05.500 --> 09:08.200
LUCKY FOR US SHE LANDED
ON THAT AWNING.

09:08.200 --> 09:09.667
OH!

09:09.667 --> 09:11.233
[GRUNTING]

09:11.233 --> 09:14.100
LET'S GO!

09:17.000 --> 09:19.400
AHH!

09:19.400 --> 09:20.900
IT'S DAKOTA!

09:20.900 --> 09:21.900
HIDE!

09:21.900 --> 09:24.400
UHH!

09:24.400 --> 09:25.900
WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO?

09:25.900 --> 09:27.767
[CHUCKLES]

09:27.767 --> 09:29.200
DON'T WORRY.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.100
I'VE GOT A PLAN.

09:32.033 --> 09:33.233
NO.

09:33.233 --> 09:35.100
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M THINKING.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.467
YOU'RE THINKING
YOU'LL WRAP ME UP
IN THAT GAUZE,

09:37.467 --> 09:38.567
THEN PUT ME

I SPENT 8 YEARS
IN THE JUNGLE

20:20.600 --> 20:24.100
LIVING ON BEETLES
AND BAT'S BLOOD.

20:24.100 --> 20:26.734
All: EW!

20:26.734 --> 20:28.734
I FOUND ALL THESE
BEAUTIFUL TREASURES,

20:28.734 --> 20:30.233
BUT NOBODY CARES
ABOUT THEM

20:30.233 --> 20:33.233
IF I DON'T HAVE SOME
STUPID MUMMY.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.934
IT'S ALL
ABOUT THE MUMMY.

20:35.934 --> 20:39.100
MUMMY, MUMMY, MUMMY!

20:39.100 --> 20:41.400
I THINK HE HAS
MUMMY ISSUES.

20:42.233 --> 20:44.367
WAIT. SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

20:44.367 --> 20:47.200
I RISKED MY LIFE
CLIMBING OUT ON AN AWNING

20:47.200 --> 20:48.967
TO GET A FAKE MUMMY?

20:48.967 --> 20:50.834
YOU CLIMBED OUT
ON AN AWNING?

20:50.834 --> 20:52.367
NO.

20:53.467 --> 20:56.900
WELL, NOW THE WHOLE
EXHIBIT IS RUINED.

20:56.900 --> 20:58.934
WELL, THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
FOR TRYING TO MAKE MONEY

20:58.934 --> 21:00.367
OFF OF ANOTHER
CULTURE'S TREASURES.

21:00.367 --> 21:02.033
IT WASN'T
ABOUT THE MONEY.

21:02.033 --> 21:04.367
YOU ARE SELLING
QUEEN QUIQUI BUBBLE-HEADS.

21:04.367 --> 21:05.800
KIDS LOVE THEM.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.133
OK. THERE'S A TRUCK
WAITING OUTSIDE.

21:09.133 --> 21:11.233
ALL IN FAVOR OF RETURNING
QUEEN QUIQUI'S TREASURES

21:11.233 --> 21:13.300
TO HER PYRAMID
RAISE YOUR HANDS.

21:15.200 --> 21:16.934
OHH.

21:16.934 --> 21:19.600
GOOD. NOW LET'S GET
CODY UNWRAPPED

21:19.600 --> 21:21.100
BECAUSE HE REALLY
HAS TO GO.

21:21.100 --> 21:22.467
NOT ANYMORE.

21:22.467 --> 21:25.133
THIS GAUZE IS
REALLY ABSORBENT.

21:34.300 --> 21:35.300
HEY, MR. MOSEBY.

21:35.300 --> 21:36.934
WELCOME BACK.

21:36.934 --> 21:38.233
HOW WAS YOUR
FRIEND'S WEDDING?

21:38.233 --> 21:41.133
GREAT. THEY LOVED ALL
THE PUDDING I BROUGHT.

21:41.133 --> 21:44.133
THAT EXPLAINS SO MUCH.

21:44.133 --> 21:46.400
SO, HOW DID THINGS GO
DURING MY ABSENCE?

21:46.400 --> 21:47.967
OH, GREAT. EXCELLENT.

21:47.967 --> 21:49.767
NO PROBLEM WHATSOEVER.

21:49.767 --> 21:50.800
REALLY?

21:50.800 --> 21:53.133
OK.

21:53.133 --> 21:55.133
YOU BROKE ME DOWN.

21:55.133 --> 21:56.800
OH, I'M IN POWERFUL TROUBLE.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.500
THE MUMMY WAS A FAKE!

21:58.500 --> 22:01.400
THEN WHAT ARE ALL THESE
PEOPLE IN LINE TO SEE?

22:01.400 --> 22:05.000
MR. TIPTON'S
GREATEST TREASURE.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.467
HI.

22:06.467 --> 22:07.667
BYE!

22:07.667 --> 22:08.700
HI!

22:08.700 --> 22:09.600
BYE!

22:09.600 --> 22:10.667
DON'T TOUCH ME.

22:10.667 --> 22:12.767
I'M PRICELESS.

22:12.767 --> 22:13.767
HI!

22:13.767 --> 22:14.767
BYE!

22:14.767 --> 22:16.033
HI!

22:16.033 --> 22:17.900
BYE!

22:17.900 --> 22:18.900
HI!

22:18.900 --> 22:20.500
BYE!

22:20.500 --> 22:21.500
HI!

22:21.500 --> 22:22.500
BYE!

22:22.500 --> 22:24.033
HI!

22:24.033 --> 22:25.400
GOOD-BYE!
