[ Booth ] Oh!
Okay, what rock did this guy
crawl out from under?

03:58.197 --> 04:00.358
The victim was dropped
from an excavator,

04:00.449 --> 04:02.531
and the remaining load
fell and crushed his skull.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.119
[Brennan]
Booth is in a good mood...

04:04.203 --> 04:08.162
because his mother finally
returned after abandoning him
25 years ago.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.240
Twenty-four years.
And don’t say it like that.

Well, that’s got to be...
complicated.

04:13.462 --> 04:14.998
It’s not.
It’s great, actually.

04:15.089 --> 04:17.455
So keep your poking around
to the remains there, huh?

04:17.550 --> 04:20.007
This section of the skull
indicates male.

04:20.094 --> 04:24.758
The parabolic dimensions
of the dental arch
indicate Caucasian.

[ Hodgins ]
Uniform is made
of polybenzimidazole.

04:28.185 --> 04:29.846
I think our victim
was a firefighter.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.802
Okay, now I’m mad.

04:31.897 --> 04:34.639
Skull fragments show signs
of heavy rodent predation.

04:34.733 --> 04:37.770
[ Saroyan ]
And based on flesh tone
and ambient temperature,

04:37.862 --> 04:39.898
I’d say he’s been dead
about four days.

04:39.989 --> 04:41.775
Which lines up when
this building came down.

04:41.866 --> 04:44.482
Could be a fire inspector going
through a last walk—through.

04:44.577 --> 04:47.489
I’ll check with the local
fire stations and make sure
that no one’s missing.

04:47.580 --> 04:51.118
Actually, I’m not so sure
our victim was a firefighter
after all.

04:51.208 --> 04:54.371
You know what? I’m no squint,
but I’m pretty sure
the uniform’s a giveaway here.

04:54.462 --> 04:59.206
Yeah, well, so is this.
Velcro pants and a thong.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.466
Oh.

05:03.554 --> 05:05.966
Either, uh, rats ate
the rest of his underwear,

05:06.056 --> 05:08.183
or I’d say our victim
was a stripper.

05:08.267 --> 05:11.509
Bones, let’s not tell my mom
about this one, okay?

05:11.604 --> 05:14.095
- Why?
- Really?

05:47.848 --> 05:50.134
I’m gonna be pasting this guy
together for days.

05:50.226 --> 05:53.013
His skull didn’t stand a chance
against a block of concrete.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.845
How bad is your luck
to have the same building
fall on you twice?

05:55.940 --> 05:59.478
Ourjob is not to speculate
on the level of this man’s
misfortune.

05:59.568 --> 06:01.479
Ourjob is to determine
his identity.

06:01.570 --> 06:05.563
Which isn’t gonna be easy,
since it looks like he stepped
on a land mine with his face.

06:05.658 --> 06:08.024
Based on the epiphyseal union
of the sternal clavicle,

06:08.118 --> 06:09.699
the victim was in his mid—20s.

06:09.787 --> 06:13.621
Which is consistent with
his being an exotic dancer,

06:13.707 --> 06:16.119
as a high percentage of men
go into the profession...

06:16.210 --> 06:17.746
as a means to pay for college.

06:17.836 --> 06:20.543
There’s a fact
I didn’t expect from you.

06:20.631 --> 06:23.668
I wrote an anthropology paper
on stripping in grad school.

06:23.759 --> 06:27.092
People who disrobe
for the pleasure of others are fascinating.

06:27.179 --> 06:28.680
That’s kind of
the whole point.

06:28.764 --> 06:31.130
While women have stripped
for millennia,

06:31.225 --> 06:34.217
it wasn’t until the 1970s that
women felt empowered enough...

06:34.311 --> 06:36.427
to publicly enjoy
men stripping for them.

06:36.522 --> 06:41.061
When did empowerment
become stuffing dollar bills
down a man’s pants?

06:41.151 --> 06:45.394
The 1970s. I already said that.
You should pay closer attention.

06:45.489 --> 06:49.357
Okay, but what was a stripper
doing in a condemned building?

06:49.451 --> 06:52.818
The lack of plaster and dust
in the posterior pharynx...

06:52.913 --> 06:54.949
suggests he was dead
before the building came down.

06:55.040 --> 06:58.203
Someone dragged our victim’s
dead body into a building,

06:58.294 --> 07:00.410
knowing that it was going
to be demolished.

07:00.504 --> 07:02.540
Nice way
to get rid of a body.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.622
Look at this.

07:04.717 --> 07:06.378
A calf implant.

07:06.468 --> 07:10.632
Well, as a stripper, he would want
his body to look its most appealing.

07:10.723 --> 07:14.056
[ Saroyan ]
Well, lucky for us,
he cared about his work.

07:14.143 --> 07:20.309
The serial number on this
implant should give us
our victim’s l.D.

Well done, Mr. Bray.

the case, or are you here
to annoy me?

Of course, the case.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.089

Uh, well,
the killer’s decision...

07:49.303 --> 07:52.045
to use a building ready for
demolition as a dump site...

The victim’s name
is Jack Spindler.

08:12.576 --> 08:16.160
He was reported missing
yesterday by his boss
at Duncore Investments.

08:16.246 --> 08:19.409
The stripper was moonlighting
as a stockbroker?

08:20.751 --> 08:21.957

- Is that him?
— Mm—hmm.

What’s up with this cash?
You taking me out?

08:29.426 --> 08:31.758
No. I found it
in the victim’s clothing.

08:34.473 --> 08:36.338
He was probably killed
right after a gig.

08:36.433 --> 08:39.391
Well, if! can figure out
what service he worked for,

08:39.478 --> 08:42.094
they should be able to tell us
where his last gig was.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.599
Hence the naked men
on your screen?

08:44.775 --> 08:47.312
Trouble is, none of them
use their real names,

08:47.403 --> 08:50.190
and doesn’t seem like he worked
for any of the agencies.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.941
He was probably trying to keep
his otherjob a secret...

08:52.032 --> 08:53.647
from his bosses at Duncore.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.243
I guess it’s hard
to make a living...

08:55.327 --> 08:56.703
on a hundred bucks in tips.

08:56.787 --> 08:58.277
Wait a minute.

08:58.372 --> 09:00.488
When people
tip the strippers,

09:00.582 --> 09:02.368
they usually give them more
than one bill, don’t they?

09:02.459 --> 09:04.120
Why? Are you thinking prints?

09:04.211 --> 09:06.953
Because there could be hundreds
of those on any one bill.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.083
But if we find the same print
on multiple bills,

09:09.174 --> 09:11.290
it’ll tell us who gave him the money
the night that he died.

09:11.385 --> 09:15.344
You know, if! had any
non-crime—related cash
on me right now,

09:15.431 --> 09:17.422
I would be stuffing it
down those pants.

Oh, look at this

Yeah.

11:00.118 --> 11:01.574
I thought Booth
was your little noodle.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.653
Well, he was,
and so was his brother,

11:03.747 --> 11:05.533

too many noodles.

She can be the doctor noodle.

that she had to.

I imagine the injury to
your left greater trochanter...

11:23.183 --> 11:25.299

was caused by a beating.

11:25.394 --> 11:28.431

to cause you to limp
after all these years.

Jack missing two days ago.
Am I correct, Mr. Harrison?

12:42.888 --> 12:45.174
Yeah, I reported him.
Spindler never missed work.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.756
So when I couldn’t
get him on the phone,
I knew something was wrong.

12:47.851 --> 12:51.469
— Was he a good employee?
— He was the hardest—working
son of a bitch I had.

12:51.563 --> 12:54.851

in new accounts while he was
still in the trainee program.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.978

he was responsible
for a lot of clients.

12:57.069 --> 13:00.482
I’m sure they wouldn’t be
too happy if he lost a chunk
of all that cash.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.483
— We don’t lose our clients’ money.
— Hmm.

13:02.574 --> 13:04.405
But with market conditions
being what they are,

13:04.493 --> 13:06.233
certain fluctuations
can cause a downturn—

13:06.328 --> 13:09.616
That’s great. I’m gonna need
his work computer and a list
of all his clients.

13:09.706 --> 13:12.368
Sure. I’ll have my assistant
shoot it over to you.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.791
Great.
You’re aware that he
was a stripper, right?

[ Chuckles ]
You got to be wrong.

13:19.466 --> 13:23.334
The guy was making
serious bank at the firm.
He wouldn’t need to strip.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.089
No, it’s true.
He was a stripper.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.091
And, as his boss,
I’m surprised
you didn’t know that.

13:27.182 --> 13:29.548
The only thing I cared about
was how much money
he brought in.

13:29.643 --> 13:34.512

would react if he found out
that you hired a stripper.

in government pensions.

I’ve been down to
my last five bucks,

13:59.214 --> 14:01.250
but even then, lwouldn’t
take my clothes off for money.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.424
You know, based on
your robust frame,
muscular build...

14:04.511 --> 14:08.470
and symmetrical features,
you can make a good income
as an exotic dancer.

14:08.557 --> 14:10.969
Then I wasted a lot of money
on grad school.

14:11.059 --> 14:15.052

had a successful profession.

Are you trying to get me
to strip, Dr. B.?

14:17.399 --> 14:19.640
I’m just saying that
I understand the impulse.

14:19.735 --> 14:22.192
It’s a way to project power
and fertility.

14:22.279 --> 14:24.110
Hmm.

14:24.197 --> 14:28.657
It seems the calf implants were
not the only surgical procedures
performed on the victim.

The proximal end of the tibia
has been cut and realigned.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.865

This is evidence
of a tibial osteotomy.

14:35.959 --> 14:39.543
Based on the extensive
remodeling, he had this
surgery done years ago.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.415
He must have suffered
from Blount’s disease.

14:41.506 --> 14:44.373
It’s very common in severely
overweight children.

14:44.468 --> 14:46.709

start stripping as a kid.

14:54.352 --> 14:57.515
Think someone else was too.
Looks like he had a girlfriend.

14:57.606 --> 15:01.474

There are no coincidences.
I’m sure your shrink
told you that too.

fluid was inconclusive.

because the victim’s D.N.A.

for prints.

20:27.268 --> 20:28.974
The same print on multiple bills...

20:29.062 --> 20:32.054

placed the bills
in the victim’s pants.

to earn those.

more to do with the tipper
than the stripper.

Well, unfortunately, most
of the bills were slathered
in the same coconut oil...

— that he was slathered in.
— That seems to be a no.

even better than a print.

You think that he’d be willing
to kill because the victim
stole some of his clients?

21:56.774 --> 21:59.982

not about the wallet
and more about his ego.

You know, he’s getting older.
He’s not looking so good.

22:02.238 --> 22:05.605
I’m sure Sweets said that
if Storm didn’t know what else
to do with himself,

22:05.700 --> 22:08.112
he would lash out at the person
he viewed as a threat.

from his boss pressuring him
to do better.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.184

28:17.280 --> 28:19.737
Perhaps stripping was
a way for him to relax.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.585
I liked her.

28:38.676 --> 28:42.464

say that, not— not now.

what you should say.

28:46.767 --> 28:48.803

Can you bring up
my station?

28:50.062 --> 28:52.439

belong to a Cynthia White, 24.

cells are a match...

from the vaginal fluid.

That is her fiance,
who was booked and released
for battery.

29:10.708 --> 29:13.871

found out that she slept

She didn’t press charges.

29:33.856 --> 29:35.938
Oh, it is my business,
Jason.

29:36.025 --> 29:38.607

about Cynthia sleeping
with the stripper,

29:38.694 --> 29:40.559
you wouldn’t be here

killed the stripper.

had her bachelorette party.

and he would just
stare at her.

31:35.436 --> 31:39.725

I grew up in a household
of violence and hatred.

31:39.815 --> 31:41.976
And look at me now.
I look for that every day.

31:42.068 --> 31:44.309

Why didn’t I stop my own mom?

31:54.663 --> 31:56.915
Because it’s difficult.

31:56.999 --> 31:59.160
Isn’t that what you
said about my dad?

32:01.212 --> 32:03.624
How long did it take me
to forgive him?

32:03.714 --> 32:06.000
You think I still
don’t get angry?

32:08.135 --> 32:10.797
Maybe it’s just simpler
this way, Bones.

32:10.888 --> 32:12.970
Is that what
your religion says?

32:13.057 --> 32:15.799
Really? Religion?
You gonna bring that
into this conversation now?

32:15.893 --> 32:19.727
The Jesus myth is all about
forgiveness, isn’t it?

32:19.814 --> 32:21.304
It’s not a myth.

32:21.398 --> 32:24.686
Absolution, our ability
to transform ourselves.

32:24.777 --> 32:26.438
So you grew up suffering.

32:26.570 --> 32:29.858
In the myth, Jesus suffered,
and he forgave those.
It’s not a myth.

32:30.783 --> 32:32.273
Please, Booth.

32:32.368 --> 32:35.781
Water to wine,
raising the dead,
walking on water—

32:35.871 --> 32:38.328
these defy the basic
laws of physics.

32:38.415 --> 32:39.996
But forgiveness—

32:41.043 --> 32:42.954
that’s its value.

32:43.045 --> 32:46.003
That’s why the myth
has endured.

32:52.138 --> 32:55.380
So I finished going through
the victim’s work computer.

32:55.474 --> 32:58.341
These are all the clients
listed, as you can see.

32:58.435 --> 33:01.393
That’s a whole lot of people
who’ve saved more money
than I have.

33:01.480 --> 33:06.349
Yeah, but the total assets
for all these clients
is only 2.4 million.

33:06.443 --> 33:10.857
His boss said that Jack’s clients
had over five million in assets.

33:10.948 --> 33:14.987
Yeah, that’s the thing.
Why didn’t his boss give us
access to all of them?

33:15.077 --> 33:18.069
Jack’s girlfriend,
Kristy Mineta,
isn’t even listed.

33:18.164 --> 33:19.779
Why hide only
certain clients?

33:19.874 --> 33:21.830
Well, that wasn’t
the only thing hidden.

33:21.917 --> 33:26.957
There’s evidence of e—mails
that his boss, Seth, scrubbed
after Jack was killed.

33:27.047 --> 33:30.380
— Can you reconstruct them?
— Seriously? You have to ask?

33:30.467 --> 33:33.800
So the e—mails outline
his boss’s strategy...

33:33.888 --> 33:38.632
for buying large amounts
of a cheap, risky stock
called Venture Command.

33:38.767 --> 33:41.258
I’ve got a bad feeling
about this.
Yeah, and you should.

33:41.353 --> 33:44.937
The plan was to buy the stock cheap,
artificially inflate the value...

33:45.024 --> 33:48.061
and sell it to unsuspecting clients
before it crashes.

33:48.152 --> 33:50.268
— And that’s legal?
- No, it’s not.

33:50.362 --> 33:53.195
It’s a felony practice known
as a “pump and dump.”

33:53.282 --> 33:55.398
Does no one on Wall Street
have a conscience?

33:55.492 --> 33:57.278
Well, Jack Spindler
might have had one.

33:57.369 --> 34:00.486
Take a look at this e-mail
that Jack sent back to his boss.

34:00.581 --> 34:03.823
“Seth, I don’t know if! can do this.
We need to talk.”

34:03.918 --> 34:07.285
Jack sent that three days
before he was killed.

34:09.506 --> 34:12.464
I am not incriminating myself.
I am not stupid.

34:12.551 --> 34:15.088
I am a graduate
of the Wharton School of Business.

34:15.179 --> 34:16.885
You have to understand
something here, Seth.

34:16.972 --> 34:19.349
This is a homicide
invesﬂgaﬂon,okay?

34:19.433 --> 34:23.221

They’re not my concern.

34:23.312 --> 34:26.679

what happened.

34:26.815 --> 34:28.271
That’s all.
Fine.

34:28.359 --> 34:30.975
The full client list
wasn’t on Jack’s computer...

34:31.070 --> 34:34.278
because it’s Duncore policy
that a senior agent— me—

34:34.365 --> 34:35.901

34:35.991 --> 34:37.856
So you took credit
for Jack’s clients?

34:37.952 --> 34:40.910

Part of a trainee
paying his dues.

34:40.996 --> 34:42.987
You want a list of the clients
we shared, no problem.

34:43.082 --> 34:45.038
That’d be great, yeah. Also...

34:45.167 --> 34:49.877

about this “pump and dump” scam
involving Venture Command stock.

I may even, you know, take you up
on that advice on my pension.

35:02.685 --> 35:05.677
Venture Command
was a small company.

35:05.771 --> 35:08.478

of a few million shares.

35:08.565 --> 35:12.934
We promoted the stock
in chat rooms,
through e—mail blasts.

35:13.028 --> 35:16.395
We told our clients
the stock was a sure thing.

35:16.490 --> 35:18.731
I would never do that
with your pension.

35:18.826 --> 35:20.612
Of course not.

he didn’t want any of it.

He was my best trainee.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.372

You didn’t want
to spend any time
in federal prison,

the e—mail to me.

Jack wasn’t questioning
the legality of what
we were doing.

35:47.146 --> 35:48.807
“I don’t know
if I can do this”?

35:48.897 --> 35:51.183
He wanted to know how to
get the client to bite.

35:51.275 --> 35:54.142

selling worthless stock
to his girlfriend?

You think the ears were

37:35.838 --> 37:39.171

37:39.258 --> 37:42.546
The depressed fractures and
the displaced ossicular chain...

37:42.636 --> 37:46.299
are consistent with the victim
being pistol—whipped
with the butt of a gun.

37:46.432 --> 37:50.220
I agree. But according to Hodgins,
there was no trace
that would indicate a gun.
