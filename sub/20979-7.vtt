Valley furmite problem solved.
Eep, scratch that off the to-do slate.

01:07.859 --> 01:11.321
Thanks, Leader Grug.
Or may I call you Dad?

01:11.405 --> 01:15.242
No. And another problem appears.
Here, chew these.

01:15.325 --> 01:16.868
Hm. Hm!

01:16.952 --> 01:19.705
- Tastes like pretty.
- [sniffs]

01:19.788 --> 01:22.457
[Eep] Ha-ha, that's 15 problems in a row.

01:23.458 --> 01:27.045
I don't wanna say I can solve every
problem, but you know, that's how it is.

01:27.129 --> 01:28.547
Way to go, buddy.

01:28.630 --> 01:32.592
I wish I had a problem for you to solve,
but I'm too busy looking for my family.

01:32.676 --> 01:34.636
You still haven't found 'em?

01:34.720 --> 01:37.431
Munk, not to concern you,
but that's a problem.

01:37.514 --> 01:41.768
[laughs] Yeah, I guess it is.
Yay, I got a problem!

01:41.852 --> 01:44.396
Do you think you could find
Papa, Mama, and my sister Gunk?

01:44.479 --> 01:45.772
I lost 'em 42 moons ago.

01:45.856 --> 01:47.899
We were playing
Hide and Go Hide Some More.

01:47.983 --> 01:49.693
And then they vanished forever.

01:49.776 --> 01:53.739
Or they're still playing the game.
My family's very competitive.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.658
Worry not, my good Munk.
Grug Crood is on the case.

01:56.742 --> 02:01.622
In fact, I bet they're right under here.
Or somewhere else.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.957
You know, that wouldn't
have made much sense anyway.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.792

to make sure Sandy took a nap.

put me to sleep?

[Ugga growls]

02:32.694 --> 02:35.906
Oh, fine. You want the truth?

02:35.989 --> 02:39.034
I didn't blow off your note
'cause I didn't read it.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.869
It's because I can't read.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.663
[all gasp]

02:42.746 --> 02:45.874
I look at all that
and all I see is silly squiggles.

02:45.957 --> 02:50.253
Oh, come on. You can read.
You read Eep's diary all the time.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.254
[gasps] Hey!

02:51.338 --> 02:56.968
No, I just pretended so people think
I'm smart and not just gorgeous.

02:57.052 --> 03:01.640
But I'm a fraud! A gorgeous fraud!

03:01.723 --> 03:03.892
Oh, ooh!

03:03.975 --> 03:05.519
Don't worry. We'll teach you to read.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.939
And then you can see what
all the fuss is about with Eep's diary.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.357
Hey!

03:10.440 --> 03:13.193
That's a great idea, Thunk.
She should learn.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.612
Then she can read
all the chore lists I leave her.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.657
Oh, gee. That would be great.

03:18.740 --> 03:22.452
I just hope my dusty old brain
is up for it.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.079

You?

03:36.466 --> 03:38.009
Amber?

03:38.093 --> 03:40.387
No. Amber would remember that hair.

03:40.470 --> 03:43.598
- Oh.
- [stutters] Er, uh...

03:43.682 --> 03:47.227
Amber mean... Amber hear someone
calling from under rock.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.317
[sighs] This is getting us nowhere.

03:54.401 --> 03:55.777
Okay, when I lost my bonking rock,

03:55.861 --> 03:57.863
I retraced my steps
to where I last saw it,

03:57.946 --> 04:00.073
so maybe we could find
your family the same way.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.576
Live my life in reverse?

04:02.659 --> 04:05.495
Well, it's not going anywhere forward,
so why not?

- Uh, could you speed this up?
- Huh? Yeah, sure.

[sighs] It hasn't taken me this long
to solve a problem in a while.

04:43.408 --> 04:46.161
Ooh, maybe if I lose my family,
they'll lead me to Munk's.

It's perfect.

Bring it closer.

Too close. Back up.

learning opportunity. [laughs]

05:43.760 --> 05:48.431

and one is for little boys.

- Who you calling little?

- You do?

- How, if you can't read?
- I guess I must be learning, then.

I think we're good to go.

Really, don't worry.
Nobody can solve every problem.

06:48.575 --> 06:52.579
I can. Look, I'm a great leader,
and great leaders solve every problem.

06:52.662 --> 06:55.832
I know. I'll solve it by finding
you a new family.

- No, we've already got a Munk.

Ah, uh... Well, you weren't
my first choices.

07:11.389 --> 07:14.601
Sorry. Our family's too normal
for your weird problem.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.687
But thank you for agreeing to be
the best family Munk could ever ask for.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.397
Other than his real family, of course.

07:19.481 --> 07:24.319
Real families are overrated.
Just ask my kids, who never visit me!

07:24.402 --> 07:26.237
And they say I yell too much.

07:26.321 --> 07:29.449
I'm happy to help. I had a good run
as Womp, but it's time to move on.

07:29.532 --> 07:32.327
Amber still get paid
whether plan work or not, right?

07:32.410 --> 07:35.914
This plan's gonna work.
I solve problems. It's, like, what I do.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.208
Say, fella, the furmites are back.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.086
Impossible. That problem's already
been scratched off the list. See?

07:41.169 --> 07:43.338
- Yes, but...
- The list has spoken.

07:45.256 --> 07:51.763
- Munk, say hello to your new family.
- Hello! Oh, wow!

07:52.681 --> 07:54.766
Give me a hug, sis?

07:54.849 --> 07:55.934

08:08.697 --> 08:10.615

08:10.699 --> 08:15.203
Uh, gee, I don't know.
Play Hide and Go Hide Some More?

08:15.286 --> 08:18.456
Or how about some family grooming time?

08:21.001 --> 08:23.586
So, I can scratch this off my list?

08:23.670 --> 08:24.921

Nope. Can't read it. Not a clue.

08:40.687 --> 08:44.816
Oh, well. Maybe I'm just a lost cause.

08:44.899 --> 08:49.404
You've been working so hard, Mom.
Take a break and eat some berries.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.574
Oh, brain food! Don't mind if I do.

08:55.118 --> 08:56.453
Ooh, uh...

08:56.536 --> 08:59.414
Actually, I stopped eating fruit.
Gives me gas.

08:59.497 --> 09:02.125
That's not true. You love fruit
even more than you love us.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.711
- And you love having gas, too.
- [laughs nervously]

09:04.794 --> 09:07.005
Right. How could I forget?

09:08.840 --> 09:10.216
Uh...

09:17.557 --> 09:20.351
Okay, fine! I can read!

09:20.435 --> 09:21.352
[both gasp]

09:21.436 --> 09:24.856
You lied to us! That checks out.

09:24.939 --> 09:30.111
All to avoid some chores?
Well, you got a lot of making up to do.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.155
[shouts] Oh!

09:32.238 --> 09:36.743
- My back! I can't move.
- Nice try. Now get a-choresin'.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.621
No! I'm serious! Help!

09:41.581 --> 09:44.459
Eh. Still beats doing chores.

09:44.542 --> 09:49.672
Okay, and...
There! A new family portrait.

09:49.756 --> 09:52.634
Hey, Munk, you're not smiling.
Don't worry. I'll fix it.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.096
Oh. That wasn't weird.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.223
Hey, thanks for your help, buddy,
but, you know,

09:58.306 --> 10:01.184
the thing is, this new family
isn't quite working out.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.519
La, la, la!

10:02.602 --> 10:06.898
- Amber no get paid enough for this.
- Hey, you got paid? She got paid?

10:06.981 --> 10:10.985
Hey, no one's family is perfect.
Point is, problem solved.

10:11.069 --> 10:12.989
And once it's scratched off,
it's solved forever.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.199
Furmites? I already solved you.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.910
New Mom, is that a friendly swarm?

10:18.993 --> 10:23.164
No, and maybe no call Amber "Mom."

10:35.760 --> 10:38.054
That was close. Right, Munk family?

10:38.138 --> 10:41.641
About that, if a family's gonna kill me,
I want it to be my own.

10:41.724 --> 10:46.062
- Yeah. Amber no need free fruit that bad.
- I just gotta be Womp.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.522
La, la, la, la.

10:47.605 --> 10:50.024
Sorry I didn't solve your problem, Munk.

10:50.108 --> 10:53.278
I guess I'm not a truly,
truly great leader after all.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.237
Sure, you are.

10:54.320 --> 11:00.451
You always try, and that makes you
a great leader and a truly great friend.

11:00.535 --> 11:01.995
Thanks, buddy.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.914
I can't promise I'll find them,
but I'll never stop looking.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.458
Wherever they are,
no matter how hard I have to...

11:07.542 --> 11:10.670
- Gunk, I finally found you!
- Got me.

11:10.753 --> 11:13.065
I thought you'd never find me
hiding under that small rock.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.466
What? I... But I checked under there!

11:16.175 --> 11:19.804
Hey, you wanna search for Mom and Dad?
I think they're hiding in a chasm.

Howl Day would never come.

12:11.606 --> 12:13.816
Then I didn't miss it.

12:13.900 --> 12:18.404
I promise to keep the spirit of Howl
in my heart from now on.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.783
And that's long enough. Yah!

12:21.866 --> 12:23.368
Happy Howl Day.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.661
Ah!

12:24.744 --> 12:28.289
Oh, Sandy, this is your first
Howl Day, isn't it?

12:28.373 --> 12:29.832
It's the best day of the season.

12:29.916 --> 12:35.129
We get to celebrate Howl,
the valley's greatest hero.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.632
<i>'Twas a day long ago,</i>

12:37.715 --> 12:41.469
<i>when all through the valley,
not a creature was stirring.</i>

12:41.552 --> 12:44.013
<i>Except 20 man-eating bear owls.</i>

12:44.097 --> 12:45.223
<i>The beasts were real hungry,</i>

12:45.306 --> 12:48.476
<i>like a baby who missed snack time
and they're all hungry.</i>

12:48.559 --> 12:51.646
<i>Everyone would've been devoured
if not for Howl.</i>

12:51.729 --> 12:53.940
<i>He stepped up and told those beasts...</i>

12:54.023 --> 12:57.193
[howling]

12:57.276 --> 13:01.614
And by doing so,
Howl sacrificed himself to the valley.

13:01.698 --> 13:04.575
- [coughs]
- [scoffs]

13:04.659 --> 13:08.830
Wow, son, you really made Howl
come to life. And then, to death.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.707
[scoffs] Give me a break.

13:10.790 --> 13:14.168
Don't listen to them, Sandy.
It's all make-believe.

13:14.252 --> 13:15.086
Huh?

13:15.169 --> 13:18.881
I once tried to save the day
by howling with all my heart.

13:18.965 --> 13:22.218
[shouting]

13:22.301 --> 13:24.762
[howls]

13:28.224 --> 13:30.226
[continues howling]

13:30.309 --> 13:31.519
[moos]

13:32.228 --> 13:33.438
[Eep] <i>It didn't work.</i>

13:35.940 --> 13:37.608
[growls]

13:37.692 --> 13:39.694
My heart was broken that day,

13:39.777 --> 13:43.322
as were my ribs, elbows,
and several of my toes.

13:44.574 --> 13:48.077
So let's not make Howl Day
into such a big deal.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.163
Eep, I hear ya.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.082
Everyone, we're gonna make this
Howl Day into such a big deal.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.000
[scoffs]

13:54.083 --> 13:55.752
[all cheering]

13:55.835 --> 13:57.003
[man] All right!

13:57.086 --> 14:00.173
I'm talking big feast.
Tons of decorations.

14:00.256 --> 14:04.093
And to cap it all off,
a grand reenactment of Howl's triumph.

14:04.177 --> 14:07.388
Son, I am trusting you to play Howl.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.932
[gasps] Me? I'd better practice.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.310
[howls]

14:12.393 --> 14:16.522
Baitsy, you play Howl's lookout tree.
Mow, you'll be a rock.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.649
- [laughs]
- [grunts happily]

14:18.733 --> 14:22.945
Oh, and don't worry, Eep.
I got a special role for you, too.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.782
You'll be a bear owl's butt with Womp.

14:25.865 --> 14:30.495
- I got dibs on the left cheek.
- Honey, you know what they say.

14:30.578 --> 14:34.540
There are no small parts,
just small butts.

14:34.624 --> 14:38.461
I don't want to be a dumb butt
in some dumb reenactment

14:38.544 --> 14:40.963
about a dumb guy
who probably wasn't even real.

14:41.047 --> 14:46.427
[gasps] Eep besmirch Howl good name!
Amber besmirch Eep face!

14:46.511 --> 14:49.722
Now, now. Hey, come on, guys.
Eep doesn't mean it.

14:49.806 --> 14:55.686
Yes, I do. Think about it.
One weakling stopped 20 bear owls?

14:55.770 --> 14:59.690
- That story makes no sense.
- [all] Boo!

14:59.774 --> 15:06.280
Oh, yeah? Go ahead and boo.
I boo your boos. Boo!

15:06.364 --> 15:07.657
[laughs]

15:07.740 --> 15:09.409
Well, my daughter's clearly gone crazy.

15:09.492 --> 15:13.246
So, moving on. We need to cut down
the biggest lookout tree ever.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.956
Who's got the sharpest teeth?

15:15.039 --> 15:16.749
[all chatter]

15:16.833 --> 15:18.543
Don't worry, Eep.

15:18.626 --> 15:24.090
Howl forgives you for doubting him.
Howl is as kind as he is loud.

15:24.173 --> 15:27.885
[shrieks] No! Howl is made up,

15:27.969 --> 15:31.973
Howl Day is a lie,
and I'm going to prove it.

15:32.056 --> 15:35.268
- [shouts]
- Oh, but Howl is real. Trust me.

15:35.351 --> 15:38.604
- I was there when it all went down.
- You saw Howl?

15:38.688 --> 15:40.874
Was his pelt really so green
that the grass got jealous?

15:40.898 --> 15:43.276
Did he talk like "dees"?
What did he smell like?

15:43.359 --> 15:48.322
Yes, no, and he smelled like
a ripe smash fruit on a warm summer day.

15:48.406 --> 15:49.866
And there you have it, Eep.

15:49.949 --> 15:54.787
Old Man Root just proved that Howl existed
by saying that Howl existed.

15:54.871 --> 15:59.959
Sooo... if you saw the rockslide,
then you can take us there.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.878
- No can do.
- A-ha!

16:01.961 --> 16:05.840
- Because it doesn't exist.
- Because we're already there.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.844
Oh, wait. Forgot where I was.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.179
I do that a lot.

16:11.262 --> 16:13.181
Rockslide's that-a-way.

16:13.264 --> 16:14.432
What do you think?

16:14.515 --> 16:17.643
The decorations remind us
of the predators Howl saved us from.

16:17.727 --> 16:21.564
[Ugga] Why, it's beautiful,
but I think you're overdoing it a bit.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.692
Aw, thanks, honey! More, guys, more!

16:27.361 --> 16:29.697
[Ugga] Grug, it's too heavy on that side.

16:29.780 --> 16:33.159
Yeah, you're right.
Make it heavier on the other side, guys!

16:36.412 --> 16:37.246
[Grug] Perfect!

16:37.330 --> 16:39.790
Hang there for the rest of the day
and we're golden.

16:39.874 --> 16:41.417
[groans]

16:42.168 --> 16:44.295
As promised, the rockslide.

16:44.378 --> 16:47.006
Not to be confused with this rock slide.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.592
Whee!

16:49.675 --> 16:52.637
Whoa! Howl's real rockslide!

16:54.055 --> 16:56.724
Bury me now, 'cause I'm dying.

16:56.807 --> 16:58.851
This doesn't prove anything.

16:58.935 --> 17:02.772
If Howl's story is true, there must
be a green pelt buried under there.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.648
So guess what we're gonna do now.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.400
- [Thunk grunts]
- [grunts]

17:06.483 --> 17:10.530
- [Thunk laughs]
- [both] Whee!

17:10.613 --> 17:12.323
Oh, is this not what you meant?

17:17.537 --> 17:20.665
Grug, honey, isn't all this
a little uncalled-for?

17:20.748 --> 17:21.665
Nonsense!

17:21.749 --> 17:25.086
Everything serves a purpose, Ugga.
Like these lightning bugs.

17:25.169 --> 17:28.297
They stand for the light Howl brought
in our darkest moment.

17:29.090 --> 17:31.759
Presents? What do they stand for?

17:31.842 --> 17:33.761
The presents stand
for the presents you get

17:33.844 --> 17:35.930
when someone gives you presents.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.265
Wrap faster!

17:40.142 --> 17:42.562
[Thunk gasps] I found Howl's pelt.

17:42.645 --> 17:45.648
Ugh! Ew! That's your pelt.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.567
Uh... Oh!

17:47.650 --> 17:49.318
I found my pelt.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.529
Face it. We've been digging all day,

17:51.612 --> 17:56.033
but the pelt's not in here,
and you know what that means.

17:56.117 --> 17:59.996
Aww. It met a lady pelt and ran off
to make her its bride.

18:00.079 --> 18:04.375
- No. It means Howl wasn't real.
- [Thunk gasps]

18:04.458 --> 18:06.794
Howl's pelt! He was real!

18:06.877 --> 18:10.798
I gotta show everyone!
No, my hands aren't worthy.

18:10.881 --> 18:15.720
Ah. Oh, this is the best Howl Day ever!

18:15.803 --> 18:19.056
I can't believe it. I was wrong.

18:20.725 --> 18:24.562
Ow! [howls]

18:27.356 --> 18:29.859
You did that with your voice.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.194
Um... No, I didn't.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.989
Ow! [howls]

18:38.034 --> 18:42.204
Old Man Root, are you... Howl?

18:42.288 --> 18:43.998
Me, Howl?

18:44.081 --> 18:49.253
No, I'm just a mysterious old guy
with a fuzzy origin story.

18:49.337 --> 18:54.091
- No more lies. I want the truth!
- All right. Just let go of the beard.

18:54.175 --> 18:57.386
[sighs] I am Howl.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.639
Or at least I was.

18:59.722 --> 19:02.016
<i>I wasn't what you'd call good at hunting.</i>

19:02.099 --> 19:03.893
[screams]

19:05.144 --> 19:07.396
- [laughter]
- <i>So they made me a gatherer.</i>

19:08.731 --> 19:10.441
[screams]

19:10.524 --> 19:14.695
Well, everybody decided the only thing
I was good at was screaming.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.447
But I wasn't any good at that either.

19:18.157 --> 19:21.911
Bear owls!
There are 20 of 'em, you hear me?

19:21.994 --> 19:24.163
Bear owls!

19:24.246 --> 19:25.623
[howls]

19:26.666 --> 19:29.377
<i>But I couldn't even get that right.</i>

19:29.460 --> 19:35.091
<i>I was so ashamed of myself that I ran away
to the Garden of Eaten.</i>

19:35.174 --> 19:37.510
<i>I was alone there for many moons,</i>

19:37.593 --> 19:40.137
<i>which gave me the time to stop
fearing everything</i>

19:40.221 --> 19:43.557
<i>and start loving every creature,
big and small,</i>

19:43.641 --> 19:47.311
<i>cute and scary, cool and not cool.</i>

19:47.395 --> 19:52.608
<i>Eventually, I went back to the valley,
but with a new identity.</i>

19:52.692 --> 19:55.653
<i>Florfo the Magnificent...</i>

19:55.736 --> 19:57.947
which I later changed to Old Man Root.

19:58.030 --> 20:02.118
But back in the valley,
everyone thought Howl was a hero.

20:02.201 --> 20:06.580
They heard a yell, saw the rockslide,
and just assumed the rest.

20:06.664 --> 20:08.874
I didn't have the heart
to set 'em straight.

20:08.958 --> 20:12.169
Wow! So... I was right.

20:12.253 --> 20:16.632
You may be missing the point of my story.
How I've grown as a person...

20:16.716 --> 20:17.842
[Eep] Yeah, yeah, whatever.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.594
Let's go tell everyone
that Howl was a fraud!

20:20.678 --> 20:25.266
[grunts] And to make the tree
even perfect-er...

20:25.349 --> 20:26.976
I found Howl's pelt!

20:27.059 --> 20:29.437
And it smells like greatness!

20:30.521 --> 20:33.441
- And now I can't see!
- [shouts] No!

20:34.525 --> 20:36.485
- [screams]
- [all gasp]

20:36.569 --> 20:38.571
- [grunts]
- Whew!

20:40.030 --> 20:42.324
- [screams]
- [Thunk screams]

20:42.408 --> 20:45.077
[Grug screaming]

20:47.913 --> 20:48.998
Dad!

20:49.081 --> 20:51.083
[exclaims]

20:51.167 --> 20:54.462
This was supposed
to be the best Howl Day ever.

20:54.545 --> 20:57.965
Now it's just gonna be
an okay one, at best.

20:58.048 --> 21:02.261
Dad, Howl Day isn't
about feasts or decorations.

21:02.344 --> 21:07.224
It's about celebrating a weakling
who was crushed by a rockslide.

21:07.308 --> 21:10.561
Well, yeah, but it's also about bear owls.

21:10.644 --> 21:14.857
More than 20 of them,
headed right for the valley.

21:14.940 --> 21:19.278
Well, maybe I can't hunt, fight,
or even touch my toes...

21:19.361 --> 21:23.032
Nope, but I got to do
something heroic and memorable.

21:23.115 --> 21:26.494
I can't wait to see their faces
when I tell them the truth.

21:26.577 --> 21:28.996
[howling]

21:30.706 --> 21:32.041
I'm a rockslide.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.419
There. The valley is saved.

21:35.503 --> 21:37.630
Because it doesn't matter who you are.

21:37.713 --> 21:43.135
There's a hero in all of us.
Just howl with all your heart.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.053
[sniffs]

21:44.136 --> 21:47.097
Yeah, that's what Howl Day's all about.

21:47.181 --> 21:50.184
- Get outta here, present.
- [Thunk] Also...

21:50.267 --> 21:52.061
[coughs]

21:52.144 --> 21:54.063
- [Thunk] Eep?
- I...

21:54.146 --> 21:56.982
- [whimpers]
- came here to say,

21:57.066 --> 21:59.568
I'm a bear owl's butt.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.737
[all cheer]

22:05.366 --> 22:07.827
Why didn't you tell them the truth?

22:07.910 --> 22:12.832
The story of Howl may not be true, but
maybe it's better if people think it is.

22:12.915 --> 22:17.253
Oh. Well, good for them.
I'll keep living a lie, but good for them.
