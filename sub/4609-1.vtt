00:53.089 --> 00:57.551
Once upon a time
in a kingdom far, far away,

00:57.634 --> 01:02.055
the king and queen were blessed
with a beautiful baby girl.

01:02.096 --> 01:05.809
And throughout the land,
everyone was happy...

01:05.893 --> 01:07.895
until the sun went down

01:07.979 --> 01:12.024
and they saw that their daughter was
cursed with a frightful enchantment

01:12.065 --> 01:15.154
that took hold each and every night.

01:16.779 --> 01:20.283
Desperate, they sought the help
of a fairy godmother

01:20.366 --> 01:23.368
who had them lock the young princess
away in a tower,

01:23.409 --> 01:27.248
there to await the kiss...
of the handsome Prince Charming.

01:30.585 --> 01:33.379
It was he who would chance
the perilous journey

01:33.421 --> 01:36.132
through blistering cold
and scorching desert

01:36.215 --> 01:38.508
traveling for many days and nights,

01:38.592 --> 01:40.762
risking life and limb

01:41.429 --> 01:44.348
to reach the Dragon's keep.

01:48.685 --> 01:51.313
For he was the bravest,

01:51.397 --> 01:54.024
and most handsome...

01:56.778 --> 01:58.779
in all the land.

01:58.862 --> 02:01.532
And it was destiny that his kiss

02:02.616 --> 02:05.911
would break the dreaded curse.

02:05.955 --> 02:11.750
He alone would climb to the highest room
of the tallest tower

02:11.834 --> 02:16.381
to enter the princess's chambers,
cross the room to her sleeping silhouette,

02:16.465 --> 02:19.508
pull back the gossamer curtains
to find her...

02:20.593 --> 02:21.719
What?

02:21.803 --> 02:25.390
- Princess... Fiona?
- No!

02:25.475 --> 02:28.517
Oh, thank heavens.
Where is she?

02:28.600 --> 02:32.854
- She's on her honeymoon.
- Honeymoon? With whom?

02:46.370 --> 02:49.873
# So she said
what's the problem, baby?

02:49.956 --> 02:51.707
# What's the problem?
I don't know

02:51.790 --> 02:53.792
# Well, maybe I'm in love

02:53.876 --> 02:56.338
# Think about it
every time I think 'bout it

02:56.421 --> 02:58.756
# Can't stop thinking 'bout it

02:58.839 --> 03:01.967
# How much longer
will it take to cure this?

03:02.050 --> 03:04.677
# Just to cure it,
'cause I can't ignore it

03:04.762 --> 03:06.098
# If it's love, love

03:06.181 --> 03:08.474
# Makes me wanna turn around
and face me

03:08.515 --> 03:11.143
# But I don't know nothing
'bout love

03:11.185 --> 03:13.021
# Oh, come on, come on

03:13.105 --> 03:15.315
# Turn a little faster

03:15.356 --> 03:16.900
# Come on, come on

03:16.983 --> 03:19.067
# The world will follow after

03:19.151 --> 03:20.652
# Come on, come on

03:20.694 --> 03:25.408
# Everybody's after love

03:29.870 --> 03:33.415
# So I said
I'm a snowball running

03:33.499 --> 03:37.337
# Running down into this spring
that's coming all this love

03:37.378 --> 03:40.840
# Melting under blue skies
belting out sunlight

03:40.882 --> 03:42.966
# Shimmering love

03:43.051 --> 03:44.719
# Well, baby, I surrender

03:44.802 --> 03:46.847
# To the strawberry ice cream

03:46.930 --> 03:49.889
# Never ever end of all this love

03:49.974 --> 03:51.893
# Well, I didn't mean to do it

03:51.976 --> 03:55.271
# But there's no escaping your love

03:56.022 --> 04:00.192
# These lines of lightning
mean we're never alone

04:00.234 --> 04:02.402
# Never alone, no, no

04:02.487 --> 04:04.071
# Come on, come on

04:04.156 --> 04:06.075
# Jump a little higher

04:06.157 --> 04:07.200
# Come on, come on

04:07.242 --> 04:09.536
# If you feel a little lighter

04:09.577 --> 04:10.786
# Come on, come on

04:10.870 --> 04:14.166
# We were once upon a time in love

04:14.249 --> 04:16.250
Hyah!

04:18.504 --> 04:21.213
# We're accidentally in love

04:22.089 --> 04:25.092
# Accidentally in love

04:25.592 --> 04:39.566
# Accidentally in love

04:39.608 --> 04:41.109
# Accidentally

04:41.151 --> 04:44.487
# I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm in love, I'm in love

04:44.571 --> 04:46.447
# I'm in love, I'm in love

04:46.488 --> 04:50.077
# Accidentally in love

04:50.119 --> 04:53.914
# I'm in love

04:53.955 --> 04:55.749
# I'm in love #

04:55.832 --> 04:57.959
lt's so good to be home!

05:01.045 --> 05:02.755
Just you and me and...

05:06.635 --> 05:11.305
- # Two can be as bad as one... #
- Donkey?

05:11.388 --> 05:15.309
Shrek! Fiona! Aren't you two
a sight for sore eyes!

05:15.351 --> 05:17.686
Give us a hug, Shrek,
you old love machine.

05:18.814 --> 05:22.025
And look at you, Mrs. Shrek.
How 'bout a side of sugar for the steed?

05:22.109 --> 05:24.277
Donkey, what are you doing here?

05:24.360 --> 05:26.404
Taking care of your love nest for you.

05:26.487 --> 05:30.785
Oh, you mean like... sorting the mail
and watering the plants?

05:30.868 --> 05:33.870
- Yeah, and feeding the fish!
- l don't have any fish.

05:33.954 --> 05:37.039
You do now. l call that one Shrek
and the other Fiona.

05:37.122 --> 05:40.044
That Shrek is a rascally devil.
Get your...

05:40.126 --> 05:42.837
Look at the time.
l guess you'd better be going.

05:42.920 --> 05:46.841
Don't you want to tell me about your trip?
Or how about a game of Parcheesi?

05:46.883 --> 05:51.097
Actually, Donkey? Shouldn't you be
getting home to Dragon?

05:51.181 --> 05:53.307
Oh, yeah, that.

05:53.348 --> 05:56.976
l don't know.
She's been all moody and stuff lately.

05:57.059 --> 05:58.728
l thought l'd move in with you.

05:58.812 --> 06:01.565
You know we're always happy
to see you, Donkey.

06:01.649 --> 06:04.443
But Fiona and l are married now.

06:04.526 --> 06:07.820
We need a little time, you know,
to be together.

06:09.865 --> 06:11.992
Just with each other.

06:13.202 --> 06:14.494
Alone.

06:14.578 --> 06:17.414
Say no more.
You don't have to worry about a thing.

06:17.497 --> 06:20.209
l will always be here to make sure
nobody bothers you.

06:20.292 --> 06:22.003
- Donkey!
- Yes, roomie?

06:22.086 --> 06:23.503
You're bothering me.

06:24.503 --> 06:28.007
Oh, OK. All right, cool. l guess...

06:28.091 --> 06:31.344
Me and Pinocchio was going to catch
a tournament, anyway, so...

06:31.427 --> 06:36.225
Maybe l'll see y'all Sunday
for a barbecue or something.

06:38.226 --> 06:42.399
He'll be fine.
Now, where were we?

06:42.483 --> 06:44.400
Oh.

06:44.483 --> 06:46.484
l think l remember.

06:48.738 --> 06:50.196
Donkey!

06:50.238 --> 06:53.366
l know, l know! Alone!
l'm going! l'm going.

06:53.449 --> 06:56.494
What do you want me
to tell these other guys?

07:06.921 --> 07:08.631
Enough, Reggie.

07:10.843 --> 07:14.345
''Dearest Princess Fiona.

07:14.428 --> 07:18.599
''You are hereby summoned
to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away

07:18.683 --> 07:23.356
''for a royal ball
in celebration of your marriage

07:23.439 --> 07:25.565
''at which time the King

07:25.649 --> 07:30.696
''will bestow his royal blessing...
upon you and your...''

07:30.779 --> 07:32.908
uh... ''Prince Charming.

07:32.949 --> 07:37.618
''Love, the King and Queen
of Far, Far Away.

07:37.702 --> 07:40.163
''aka Mom and Dad.''

07:40.247 --> 07:41.581
Mom and Dad?

07:41.624 --> 07:45.043
- Prince Charming?
- Royal ball? Can l come?

07:45.127 --> 07:46.920
- We're not going.
- What?

07:46.962 --> 07:49.964
l mean, don't you think
they might be a bit...

07:50.006 --> 07:53.052
shocked to see you like this?

07:53.135 --> 07:55.555
Well, they might be
a bit surprised.

07:55.638 --> 07:58.808
But they're my parents, Shrek.
They love me.

07:58.891 --> 08:01.227
And don't worry.
They'll love you, too.

08:01.310 --> 08:02.269
Yeah, right.

08:02.353 --> 08:05.105
Somehow l don't think l'll be welcome
at the country club.

08:05.146 --> 08:06.982
Stop it.
They're not like that.

08:07.065 --> 08:10.568
How do you explain Sergeant Pompous
and the Fancy Pants Club Band?

08:10.652 --> 08:14.074
Oh, come on! You could at least
give them a chance.

08:14.158 --> 08:16.198
To do what?
Sharpen their pitchforks?

08:16.283 --> 08:19.161
No! They just want
to give you their blessing.

08:19.245 --> 08:23.332
Oh, great.
Now l need their blessing?

08:23.416 --> 08:25.876
lf you want to be a part
of this family, yes!

08:25.959 --> 08:28.003
Who says l want
to be part of this family?

08:28.087 --> 08:31.090
You did!
When you married me!

08:31.173 --> 08:33.217
Well, there's some fine print for you!

08:33.301 --> 08:36.302
So that's it. You won't come?

08:36.344 --> 08:41.640
Trust me. lt's a bad idea.
We are not going! And that's final!

08:43.437 --> 08:46.146
Come on!
We don't want to hit traffic!

08:48.774 --> 08:51.652
Don't worry!
We'll take care of everything.

08:53.279 --> 08:55.781
Hey, wait for me. Oof!

09:02.120 --> 09:06.791
# Hit it! Move 'em on! Head 'em up!
Head 'em up, move 'em on! Head 'em up!

09:06.875 --> 09:09.335
# Rawhide! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up!

09:09.378 --> 09:11.714
# Move 'em on! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up! Rawhide!

09:11.797 --> 09:16.176
# Ride 'em up! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up! Move 'em on! Rawhide!

09:16.218 --> 09:18.262
# Knock 'em out! Pound 'em dead!
Make 'em tea! Buy 'em drinks!

09:18.345 --> 09:19.929
# Meet their mamas!
Milk 'em hard!

09:20.012 --> 09:22.557
# Rawhide! #
Yee-haw!

09:28.063 --> 09:30.691
- Are we there yet?
- No.

09:34.069 --> 09:36.781
- Are we there yet?
- Not yet.

09:39.867 --> 09:42.077
- OK, are we there yet?
- No.

09:42.911 --> 09:44.914
- Are we there yet?
- No!

09:44.956 --> 09:46.999
- Are we there yet?
- Yes.

09:47.082 --> 09:48.376
- Really?
- No!

09:48.459 --> 09:49.918
- Are we there yet?
- No!

09:50.002 --> 09:51.795
- Are we there yet?
- We are not!

09:51.879 --> 09:54.424
- Are we there yet?
- No!

09:55.802 --> 09:57.634
Are we there yet?

09:57.718 --> 10:01.764
That's not funny. That's really immature.

10:01.848 --> 10:04.099
This is why nobody likes ogres.

10:04.183 --> 10:05.517
Your loss!

10:05.602 --> 10:08.897
- l'm gonna just stop talking.
- Finally!

10:08.980 --> 10:12.566
This is taking forever, Shrek.
There's no in-flight movie or nothing!

10:12.649 --> 10:16.489
The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey.

10:16.572 --> 10:20.865
That's where we're going.
Far, far...

10:20.949 --> 10:22.576
away!

10:22.617 --> 10:26.247
All right, all right, l get it.
l'm just so darn bored.

10:26.289 --> 10:28.916
Well, find a way
to entertain yourself.

10:51.647 --> 10:54.274
For five minutes...

10:54.317 --> 10:56.319
Could you not be yourself...

11:05.912 --> 11:07.665
Are we there yet?

11:07.748 --> 11:10.415
- Yes!
- Oh, finally!

11:22.178 --> 11:24.263
Wow!

11:25.473 --> 11:29.852
lt's going to be champagne wishes
and caviar dreams from now on.

11:29.935 --> 11:32.857
Hey, good-looking!
We'll be back to pick you up later!

11:32.898 --> 11:38.362
# Gotta make a move
to a town that's right for me

11:41.447 --> 11:44.158
We are definitely not
in the swamp anymore.

11:44.200 --> 11:47.371
Halt!

11:48.206 --> 11:53.502
# Well, I talk about it, talk about it,
talk about it, talk about it

11:55.378 --> 11:57.881
Hey, everyone, look.

11:57.923 --> 12:01.426
# Talk about, talk about movin'... #

12:08.726 --> 12:12.770
Hey, ladies! Nice day for a parade, huh?
You working that hat.

12:20.862 --> 12:23.404
Swimming pools!
Movie stars!

12:59.234 --> 13:01.903
Announcing the long-awaited return

13:01.987 --> 13:06.575
of the beautiful Princess Fiona
and her new husband.

13:08.160 --> 13:10.038
Well, this is it.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.079
- This is it.
- This is it.

13:12.121 --> 13:13.415
This is it.

13:35.521 --> 13:39.609
Uh... why don't you guys go ahead?
l'll park the car.

13:42.652 --> 13:44.945
So...

13:44.987 --> 13:48.032
you still think
this was a good idea?

13:48.115 --> 13:52.538
Of course! Look.
Mom and Dad look happy to see us.

13:52.622 --> 13:56.792
- Who on earth are they?
- l think that's our little girl.

13:56.875 --> 14:00.254
That's not little!
That's a really big problem.

14:00.337 --> 14:03.631
Wasn't she supposed to kiss
Prince Charming and break the spell?

14:03.673 --> 14:06.926
Well, he's no Prince Charming,
but they do look...

14:07.010 --> 14:10.680
Happy now?
We came. We saw them.

14:10.764 --> 14:13.182
Now let's go before
they light the torches.

14:13.224 --> 14:16.521
- They're my parents.
- Hello? They locked you in a tower.

14:16.604 --> 14:18.104
That was for my own...

14:18.188 --> 14:22.027
Good! Here's our chance. Let's go
back inside and pretend we're not home.

14:22.109 --> 14:23.360
Harold, we have to be...

14:23.443 --> 14:26.362
Quick! While they're not looking
we can make a run for it.

14:26.445 --> 14:28.447
Shrek, stop it!
Everything's gonna be...

14:28.531 --> 14:30.867
A disaster! There is no way...

14:30.951 --> 14:32.577
- You can do this.
- l really...

14:32.660 --> 14:35.163
- Really...
- don't... want... to... be...

14:35.246 --> 14:37.331
Here!

14:39.251 --> 14:42.381
Mom... Dad...

14:43.755 --> 14:45.715
l'd like you to meet my husband...

14:45.799 --> 14:47.550
Shrek.

14:49.928 --> 14:51.763
Well, um...

14:51.847 --> 14:55.183
lt's easy to see where Fiona
gets her good looks from.

15:33.306 --> 15:35.557
Excuse me.

15:35.599 --> 15:39.351
Better out than in,
l always say, eh, Fiona?

15:41.646 --> 15:43.483
That's good.

15:44.274 --> 15:45.275
l guess not.

15:45.358 --> 15:49.821
What do you mean, ''not on the list''?
Don't tell me you don't know who l am.

15:49.904 --> 15:52.574
What's happening, everybody?
Thanks for waiting.

15:52.616 --> 15:57.079
- l had the hardest time finding this place.
- No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down!

15:57.121 --> 15:59.999
No, Dad! lt's all right.
lt's all right. He's with us.

16:00.083 --> 16:03.546
- He helped rescue me from the dragon.
- That's me: the noble steed.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.671
Waiter!
How 'bout a bowl for the steed?

16:05.754 --> 16:07.298
Oh, boy.

16:09.883 --> 16:11.468
- Um, Shrek?
- Yeah?

16:11.551 --> 16:15.095
Oh, sorry!
Great soup, Mrs Q.

16:15.138 --> 16:16.180
Mmm!

16:16.263 --> 16:18.224
No, no. Darling.

16:18.976 --> 16:21.143
Oh!

16:23.148 --> 16:26.609
So, Fiona, tell us
about where you live.

16:26.692 --> 16:28.276
Well...

16:28.318 --> 16:30.697
Shrek owns his own land.

16:31.364 --> 16:34.116
- Don't you, honey?
- Oh, yes!

16:34.160 --> 16:36.994
lt's in an enchanted forest

16:37.077 --> 16:41.833
abundant in squirrels
and cute little duckies and...

16:41.916 --> 16:43.251
What?

16:43.334 --> 16:45.501
l know you ain't
talking about the swamp.

16:45.585 --> 16:49.717
An ogre from a swamp.
Oh! How original.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.718
l suppose that would be a fine place
to raise the children.

17:03.353 --> 17:06.021
lt's a bit early to be
thinking about that, isn't it?

17:06.105 --> 17:09.026
- lndeed. l just started eating.
- Harold!

17:09.108 --> 17:12.278
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Dad. lt's great, OK?

17:12.361 --> 17:15.159
- For his type, yes.
- My type?

17:15.201 --> 17:16.576
l got to go to the bathroom.

17:16.660 --> 17:20.122
- Dinner is served!
- Never mind. l can hold it.

17:25.875 --> 17:27.044
Bon appetit!

17:27.127 --> 17:29.588
Oh, Mexican food!
My favorite.

17:29.672 --> 17:33.300
Let's not sit here with our tummies
rumbling. Everybody dig in.

17:33.384 --> 17:34.760
Don't mind if l do, Lillian.

17:34.843 --> 17:38.638
l suppose any grandchildren
l could expect from you would be...

17:38.722 --> 17:41.059
Ogres, yes!

17:41.142 --> 17:44.104
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Right, Harold?

17:44.187 --> 17:45.940
Oh, no! No! Of course, not!

17:46.023 --> 17:49.233
That is, assuming you don't
eat your own young!

17:49.316 --> 17:50.109
Dad!

17:50.192 --> 17:54.823
No, we usually prefer the ones
who've been locked away in a tower!

17:54.906 --> 17:58.617
- Shrek, please!
- l only did that because l love her.

17:58.701 --> 18:00.996
Aye, day care
or dragon-guarded castle.

18:01.079 --> 18:04.248
You wouldn't understand.
You're not her father!

18:08.920 --> 18:11.715
lt's so nice to have the family
together for dinner.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.427
- Harold!
- Shrek!

18:17.511 --> 18:18.512
- Fiona!
- Fiona!

18:18.595 --> 18:19.848
- Mom!
- Harold...

18:19.931 --> 18:20.931
Donkey!

19:23.994 --> 19:27.165
# Your fallen tears have called to me

19:28.084 --> 19:32.044
# So, here comes my sweet remedy

19:33.046 --> 19:37.466
# I know what every princess needs

19:37.508 --> 19:42.345
# For her to live life happily... #

19:44.431 --> 19:48.480
Oh, my dear.
Oh, look at you.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.398
You're all grown up.

19:52.023 --> 19:55.109
- Who are you?
- Oh, sweet pea!

19:55.193 --> 19:57.196
l'm your fairy godmother.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.906
- l have a fairy godmother?
- Shush, shush.

19:59.989 --> 20:04.369
Now, don't worry.
l'm here to make it all better.

20:04.410 --> 20:07.498
With just a...

20:08.206 --> 20:11.793
# Wave of my magic wand
Your troubles will soon be gone

20:11.876 --> 20:16.756
# With a flick of the wrist and just a flash
You'll land a prince with a ton of cash

20:16.840 --> 20:18.801
# A high-priced dress
made by mice no less

20:18.886 --> 20:21.011
# Some crystal glass pumps
And no more stress

20:21.052 --> 20:23.054
# Your worries will vanish,
your soul will cleanse

20:23.096 --> 20:24.847
# Confide in your very own
furniture friends

20:24.931 --> 20:28.059
# We'll help you set a new fashion trend

20:28.143 --> 20:32.146
- # I'll make you fancy, I'll make you great
- # The kind of girl a prince would date!

20:32.230 --> 20:34.524
# They'll write your name
on the bathroom wall...

20:34.607 --> 20:36.691
# ''For a happy ever after,
give Fiona a call!''

20:36.735 --> 20:40.739
# A sporty carriage to ride in style,
Sexy man boy chauffeur, Kyle

20:40.822 --> 20:44.410
# Banish your blemishes, tooth decay,
Cellulite thighs will fade away

20:44.493 --> 20:47.204
# And oh, what the hey!
Have a bichon frisé!'

20:47.913 --> 20:51.082
# Nip and tuck, here and there
to land that prince with the perfect hair

20:51.166 --> 20:54.585
# Lipstick liners, shadows blush
To get that prince with the sexy tush

20:54.669 --> 20:57.672
# Lucky day, hunk buffet
You and your prince take a roll in the hay

20:57.756 --> 21:00.966
# You can spoon on the moon
With the prince to the tune

21:01.090 --> 21:03.679
# Don't be drab, you'll be fab
Your prince will have rock-hard abs

21:03.803 --> 21:06.431
# Cheese soufflé, Valentine's Day
Have some chicken fricassee!

21:06.515 --> 21:09.060
# Nip and tuck, here and there
To land that prince with the perfect hair #

21:09.143 --> 21:11.227
Stop!

21:11.269 --> 21:13.064
Look...

21:13.147 --> 21:15.856
Thank you very much,
Fairy Godmother,

21:15.939 --> 21:18.818
but l really don't need all this.

21:21.154 --> 21:23.740
- Fine. Be that way.
- We didn't like you, anyway.

21:23.823 --> 21:26.910
Fiona? Fiona?

21:30.956 --> 21:34.085
Oh! You got a puppy?
All l got in my room was shampoo.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.795
Oh, uh...

21:35.878 --> 21:37.920
Fairy Godmother, furniture...

21:39.047 --> 21:41.382
l'd like you to meet my husband, Shrek.

21:41.508 --> 21:45.093
Your husband? What? What did you say?
When did this happen?

21:45.176 --> 21:46.847
Shrek is the one who rescued me.

21:46.929 --> 21:50.852
- But that can't be right.
- Oh, great, more relatives!

21:50.935 --> 21:52.727
She's just trying to help.

21:52.810 --> 21:56.023
Good! She can help us pack.
Get your coat, dear. We're leaving.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.607
- What?
- l don't want to leave.

21:57.774 --> 21:59.235
When did you decide this?

21:59.318 --> 22:01.987
- Shortly after arriving.
- Look, l'm sorry...

22:02.070 --> 22:05.449
No, that's all right.
l need to go, anyway.

22:05.490 --> 22:08.827
But remember, dear.
lf you should ever need me...

22:08.994 --> 22:10.079
happiness...

22:10.162 --> 22:11.872
is just a teardrop away.

22:11.955 --> 22:14.499
Thanks, but we've got all
the happiness we need.

22:14.582 --> 22:16.459
Happy, happy, happy...

22:16.501 --> 22:18.711
So l see.

22:18.794 --> 22:20.631
Let's go, Kyle.

22:23.383 --> 22:24.927
- Very nice, Shrek.
- What?

22:25.010 --> 22:27.721
l told you coming here was a bad idea.

22:27.804 --> 22:30.474
You could've at least tried
to get along with my father.

22:30.517 --> 22:33.143
l don't think l was going to get
Daddy's blessing,

22:33.184 --> 22:34.978
even if l did want it.

22:35.061 --> 22:39.106
Do you think it might be nice
if somebody asked me what l wanted?

22:39.189 --> 22:41.568
Sure. Do you want me
to pack for you?

22:41.652 --> 22:46.531
You're unbelievable!
You're behaving like a...

22:46.615 --> 22:49.618
- Go on! Say it!
- Like an ogre!

22:49.701 --> 22:51.163
Here's a news flash for you!

22:51.204 --> 22:55.166
Whether your parents like it or not...
l am an ogre!

23:00.878 --> 23:04.757
And guess what, Princess?
That's not about to change.

23:10.555 --> 23:14.684
l've made changes for you, Shrek.
Think about that.

23:16.562 --> 23:20.565
That's real smooth, Shrek.
''l'm an ogre!''

23:46.425 --> 23:47.927
l knew this would happen.

23:48.009 --> 23:49.929
You should.
You started it.

23:50.012 --> 23:54.016
l can hardly believe that, Lillian.
He's the ogre. Not me.

23:54.141 --> 23:57.561
l think, Harold, you're taking this
a little too personally.

23:57.602 --> 23:59.980
This is Fiona's choice.

24:00.063 --> 24:03.150
But she was supposed to choose
the prince we picked for her.

24:03.276 --> 24:07.446
l mean, you expect me to give
my blessings to this... thing?

24:07.530 --> 24:11.449
Fiona does.
And she'll never forgive you if you don't.

24:11.616 --> 24:16.162
l don't want to lose
our daughter again, Harold.

24:16.245 --> 24:18.832
Oh, you act as if love
is totally predictable.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.751
Don't you remember when
we were young?

24:21.876 --> 24:24.796
We used to walk
down by the lily pond and...

24:24.879 --> 24:28.091
- they were in bloom...
- Our first kiss.

24:28.175 --> 24:29.594
lt's not the same!

24:29.636 --> 24:33.681
l don't think you realize that
our daughter has married a monster!

24:33.765 --> 24:36.099
Oh, stop being such a drama king.

24:36.141 --> 24:38.060
Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong!

24:38.142 --> 24:41.146
La, di, da, di, da!
lsn't it all wonderful!

24:41.230 --> 24:43.275
l'd like to know
how it could get any worse!

24:43.316 --> 24:44.609
Hello, Harold.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.734
- What happened?
- Nothing, dear!

24:46.818 --> 24:49.781
Just the old crusade wound
playing up a bit!

24:50.948 --> 24:53.618
l'll just stretch it
out here for a while.

24:53.660 --> 24:56.788
You better get in.
We need to talk.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.956
Actually, Fairy Godmother,
off to bed.

24:59.038 --> 25:02.710
Already taken my pills,
and they tend to make me a bit drowsy.

25:02.795 --> 25:06.630
So, how about... we make this
a quick visit. What?

25:07.924 --> 25:10.634
Oh, hello.
Ha-ha-ha!

25:12.259 --> 25:13.887
So, what's new?

25:13.971 --> 25:17.683
You remember my son,
Prince Charming?

25:17.765 --> 25:21.228
ls that you? My gosh!
lt's been years.

25:21.311 --> 25:23.482
When did you get back?

25:23.523 --> 25:26.525
Oh, about five minutes ago, actually.

25:26.609 --> 25:30.155
After l endured blistering winds,
scorching desert...

25:30.196 --> 25:33.240
l climbed to the highest room
in the tallest tower...

25:33.323 --> 25:35.702
Mommy can handle this.

25:35.786 --> 25:39.913
He endures blistering winds
and scorching desert!

25:39.996 --> 25:43.959
He climbs to the highest bloody room
of the tallest bloody tower...

25:44.043 --> 25:45.169
And what does he find?

25:45.210 --> 25:48.966
Some gender-confused wolf
telling him that his princess

25:49.049 --> 25:50.926
is already married.

25:51.009 --> 25:53.469
lt wasn't my fault.
He didn't get there in time.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.221
Stop the car!

25:56.722 --> 25:58.389
Harold.

25:59.683 --> 26:04.146
You force me to do something
l really don't want to do.

26:04.229 --> 26:06.191
Where are we?

26:06.233 --> 26:09.235
Hi. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy!
May l take your order?

26:09.402 --> 26:13.447
My diet is ruined!
l hope you're happy. Er... okay.

26:13.530 --> 26:16.369
Two Renaissance Wraps,
no mayo... chili rings...

26:16.493 --> 26:19.913
- l'll have the Medieval Meal.
- One Medieval Meal and, Harold...

26:20.080 --> 26:22.040
- Curly fries?
- No, thank you.

26:22.081 --> 26:24.834
- Sourdough soft taco, then?
- No, really, l'm fine.

26:24.917 --> 26:28.795
Your order, Fairy Godmother.
This comes with the Medieval Meal.

26:28.878 --> 26:30.048
There you are, dear.

26:33.508 --> 26:37.263
We made a deal, Harold, and l assume
you don't want me to go back on my part.

26:37.346 --> 26:39.556
lndeed not.

26:39.599 --> 26:43.269
So, Fiona and Charming will be together.

26:43.353 --> 26:46.857
- Yes.
- Believe me, Harold. lt's what's best.

26:46.940 --> 26:49.441
Not only for your daughter...

26:50.776 --> 26:52.736
but for your Kingdom.

26:57.367 --> 26:59.492
What am l supposed to do about it?

27:01.037 --> 27:03.039
Use your imagination.

27:37.324 --> 27:38.699
Oh...

27:41.328 --> 27:43.496
Come on in, Your Majesty.

27:49.752 --> 27:52.629
# I like my town

27:54.174 --> 27:58.096
# With a little drop of poison

27:59.053 --> 28:01.640
# Nobody knows...

28:03.014 --> 28:04.975
Excuse me.

28:05.018 --> 28:07.312
Do l know you?

28:07.395 --> 28:10.190
No, you must be mistaking me
for someone else.

28:10.273 --> 28:13.985
Uh... excuse me.
l'm looking for the Ugly Stepsister.

28:15.903 --> 28:18.491
Ah! There you are. Right.

28:18.533 --> 28:23.870
You see, l need to have
someone taken care of.

28:23.953 --> 28:28.291
- Who's the guy?
- Well, he's not a guy, per se.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.209
Um... He's an ogre.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.756
Hey, buddy, let me clue you in.

28:34.839 --> 28:39.177
There's only one fellow who can handle
a job like that, and, frankly...

28:39.219 --> 28:41.386
he don't like to be disturbed.

28:41.470 --> 28:43.140
Where could l find him?

28:46.559 --> 28:48.604
Hello?

28:49.271 --> 28:51.647
Who dares enter my room?

28:51.731 --> 28:55.359
Sorry! l hope l'm not interrupting, but
l'm told you're the one to talk to

28:55.443 --> 28:57.152
about an ogre problem?

28:57.278 --> 28:59.531
You are told correct.

28:59.656 --> 29:03.367
But for this, l charge
a great deal of money.

29:03.450 --> 29:05.578
Would... this be enough?

29:12.418 --> 29:17.590
You have engaged my valuable
services, Your Majesty.

29:17.675 --> 29:21.010
Just tell me where
l can find this ogre.

29:38.945 --> 29:45.618
# Everyone says
I'm getting down too low

29:46.453 --> 29:52.542
# Everyone says
you've just gotta let it go

29:53.542 --> 29:56.337
# You just gotta let it go

30:05.598 --> 30:08.182
# I need some sleep

30:08.266 --> 30:11.645
# Time to put the old horse down

30:12.979 --> 30:15.523
# I'm in too deep

30:15.606 --> 30:18.900
# And the wheels keep spinning round

30:19.986 --> 30:26.285
# Everyone says
you've just gotta let it go #

30:28.953 --> 30:33.875
Dear Knight, I pray that you take
this favor as a token of my gratitude.

30:56.147 --> 30:57.484
Dear Diary...

30:57.567 --> 31:00.277
Sleeping Beauty is having
a slumber party tomorrow,

31:00.360 --> 31:04.156
but Dad says I can't go.
He never lets me out after sunset.

31:05.073 --> 31:07.826
Dad says I'm going away for a while.

31:07.868 --> 31:10.245
Must be like some finishing school.

31:11.204 --> 31:13.122
Mom says that when I'm old enough,

31:13.205 --> 31:15.918
my Prince Charming will rescue me
from my tower

31:16.001 --> 31:18.545
and bring me back to my family,

31:18.629 --> 31:21.840
and we'll all live
happily ever after.

31:23.591 --> 31:25.678
Mrs. Fiona Charming.

31:27.137 --> 31:30.557
Mrs. Fiona Charming.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.935
Mrs. Fiona Charming.

31:42.612 --> 31:45.488
Sorry. l hope l'm not
interrupting anything.

31:45.572 --> 31:51.162
No, no. l was just reading a, uh...
a scary book.

31:51.245 --> 31:56.292
l was hoping you'd let me apologize
for my despicable behavior earlier.

31:56.375 --> 31:58.835
- Okay...
- l don't know what came over me.

31:58.918 --> 32:02.339
Do you suppose we could pretend
it never happened and start over...

32:02.423 --> 32:05.508
- Look, Your Majesty, l just...
- Please. Call me Dad.

32:05.591 --> 32:09.721
Dad. We both acted like ogres.

32:09.805 --> 32:13.309
Maybe we just need some time
to get to know each other.

32:13.393 --> 32:17.854
Excellent idea! l was actually hoping
you might join me for a morning hunt.

32:17.937 --> 32:19.940
A little father-son time?

32:21.649 --> 32:24.277
l know it would mean
the world to Fiona.

32:32.786 --> 32:37.167
Shall we say,
7:30 by the old oak?

32:42.672 --> 32:44.714
Face it, Donkey!
We're lost.

32:44.840 --> 32:48.552
We can't be lost. We followed
the King's instructions exactly.

32:48.635 --> 32:51.054
''Head to the
darkest part of the woods...''

32:51.137 --> 32:54.142
''Past the sinister trees
with scary-looking branches.''

32:54.309 --> 32:58.521
- The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey!
- We passed that three times already!

32:58.646 --> 33:01.482
You were the one who said
not to stop for directions.

33:01.565 --> 33:05.987
Oh, great. My one chance
to fix things up with Fiona's dad

33:06.070 --> 33:08.072
and l end up lost
in the woods with you!

33:08.155 --> 33:10.407
Don't get huffy!
l'm only trying to help.

33:10.491 --> 33:12.450
l know! l know.

33:14.829 --> 33:18.165
- l'm sorry, all right?
- Hey, don't worry about it.

33:18.248 --> 33:21.419
l just really need to make
things work with this guy.

33:21.543 --> 33:24.338
Yeah, sure. Now let's go
bond with Daddy.

33:32.347 --> 33:33.723
Well, well, well, Donkey.

33:33.806 --> 33:37.309
l know it was kind of a tender
moment back there, but the purring?

33:37.476 --> 33:39.144
What? l ain't purring.

33:39.227 --> 33:41.562
Sure. What's next? A hug?

33:41.646 --> 33:45.778
Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr.
What do you think l am, some kind of a...

33:45.861 --> 33:48.445
Ha-ha!
Fear me, if you dare!

33:49.822 --> 33:50.949
Look! A little cat.

33:51.032 --> 33:54.160
- Look out, Shrek! He got a piece!
- lt's a cat, Donkey.

33:54.326 --> 33:56.246
Come here,
little kitty, kitty.

33:56.329 --> 34:01.417
Come on, little kitty. Come here.
Oh! Come here, little kitty.

34:02.793 --> 34:04.336
Whoa!

34:04.420 --> 34:08.672
- Hold on, Shrek! l'm coming!
- Come on! Get it off! Get it off!

34:08.757 --> 34:11.009
Oh, God. Oh...

34:11.092 --> 34:12.719
No!

34:14.764 --> 34:17.183
- Look out, Shrek! Hold still!
- Get it off!

34:17.224 --> 34:19.228
Shrek! Hold still!

34:20.478 --> 34:24.358
- Did l miss?
- No. You got them.

34:27.775 --> 34:31.612
Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from...

34:33.322 --> 34:36.203
Puss... in Boots!

34:36.244 --> 34:37.828
l'll kill that cat!

34:37.911 --> 34:39.079
Ah-ha-ha!

34:57.098 --> 35:00.810
- Hairball.
- Oh! That is nasty!

35:02.102 --> 35:03.771
What should we do with him?

35:03.937 --> 35:07.192
Take the sword and neuter him.
Give him the Bob Barker treatment.

35:07.276 --> 35:08.569
Oh, no! Por favor!
Please!

35:08.693 --> 35:11.403
l implore you!
lt was nothing personal, Señor.

35:11.487 --> 35:13.197
l was doing it only for my family.

35:13.280 --> 35:17.286
My mother, she is sick.
And my father lives off the garbage!

35:17.369 --> 35:20.872
The King offered me much in gold
and l have a litter of brothers...

35:20.956 --> 35:22.415
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

35:22.498 --> 35:25.250
Fiona's father paid you to do this?

35:25.292 --> 35:27.255
The rich King? SÍ.

35:30.129 --> 35:34.178
Well, so much for Dad's royal blessing.

35:34.261 --> 35:37.598
Don't feel bad. Almost everybody
that meets you wants to kill you.

35:37.640 --> 35:39.057
Gee, thanks.

35:42.142 --> 35:46.647
Maybe Fiona would've been better off
if l were some sort of Prince Charming.

35:46.731 --> 35:48.109
That's what the King said.

35:49.650 --> 35:52.861
Oh, uh... sorry. l thought that question
was directed at me.

35:53.947 --> 35:56.908
Shrek, Fiona knows
you'd do anything for her.

35:56.992 --> 36:00.204
Well, it's not like
l wouldn't change if l could.

36:00.287 --> 36:04.332
l just... l just wish
l could make her happy.

36:06.544 --> 36:08.002
Hold the phone...

36:09.462 --> 36:11.714
''Happiness.''

36:11.798 --> 36:14.675
''A tear drop away.''

36:14.758 --> 36:18.597
Donkey! Think of the saddest thing
that's ever happened to you!

36:18.680 --> 36:21.307
Aw, man, where do l begin?

36:21.348 --> 36:25.687
First there was the time that old farmer
tried to sell me for some magic beans.

36:25.771 --> 36:29.525
Then this fool had a party and he have
the guests trying to pin the tail on me.

36:29.608 --> 36:33.695
Then they got drunk and start beating me
with a stick, going ''Piñata!!''

36:33.778 --> 36:35.112
What is a piñata, anyway?

36:35.195 --> 36:37.616
No, Donkey! l need you to cry!

36:37.699 --> 36:39.117
Don't go projecting on me.

36:39.201 --> 36:41.327
l know you're feeling bad,
but you got to...

36:41.368 --> 36:43.495
Aaaahhh!

36:44.246 --> 36:46.790
You little, hairy,
litter-licking sack of...

36:53.923 --> 36:56.009
What? Is it on? Is it on?

36:57.386 --> 36:59.138
This is Fairy Godmother.

36:59.264 --> 37:01.431
I'm either away
from my desk or with a client.

37:01.555 --> 37:06.019
But if you come by the office, we'll be
glad to make you an appointment.

37:06.186 --> 37:07.937
Have a ''happy ever after. ''

37:09.898 --> 37:11.357
Oh...

37:12.357 --> 37:14.569
Are you up for a little quest, Donkey?

37:14.652 --> 37:18.156
That's more like it! Shrek and Donkey,
on another whirlwind adventure!

37:18.240 --> 37:21.743
# Ain't no stoppin' us now! Whoo!
We're on the move!

37:21.826 --> 37:26.457
- Stop, Ogre! l have misjudged you.
- Join the club. We've got jackets.

37:26.540 --> 37:30.377
On my honor, l am obliged to accompany
you until l have saved your life

37:30.460 --> 37:32.379
as you have spared me mine.

37:32.420 --> 37:35.715
The position of annoying talking animal
has already been taken.

37:35.798 --> 37:38.720
Let's go, Shrek. Shrek?

37:47.601 --> 37:50.897
- Shrek!
- Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him...

37:50.981 --> 37:52.899
in his wee little boots.

37:53.024 --> 37:56.235
You know, how many cats can wear boots?
Honestly.

37:56.278 --> 37:59.073
- Let's keep him!
- Say what?

38:00.949 --> 38:02.117
Ahh!

38:02.200 --> 38:03.994
Listen. He's purring!

38:04.077 --> 38:07.165
- Oh, so now it's cute.
- Come on, Donkey. Lighten up.

38:07.248 --> 38:10.751
Lighten up? l should lighten up?
Look who's telling who to lighten up!

38:12.836 --> 38:15.588
Shrek!

38:20.344 --> 38:21.345
Shrek?

38:32.314 --> 38:34.775
They're both festive, aren't they?

38:34.859 --> 38:36.776
What do you think, Harold?

38:36.818 --> 38:39.112
Um... Yes, yes.
Fine. Fine.

38:41.158 --> 38:44.786
Try to at least pretend you're interested
in your daughter's wedding ball.

38:44.869 --> 38:47.287
Honestly, Lillian,
l don't think it matters.

38:47.329 --> 38:49.666
How do we know there will
even be a ball?

38:49.749 --> 38:51.667
Mom. Dad.

38:51.751 --> 38:55.379
- Oh, hello, dear.
- What's that, Cedric? Right! Coming.

38:56.005 --> 38:58.132
Mom, have you seen Shrek?

38:58.174 --> 39:01.009
l haven't.
You should ask your father.

39:01.177 --> 39:05.723
Be sure and use small words, dear.
He's a little slow this morning.

39:05.806 --> 39:08.225
- Can l help you, Your Majesty?
- Ah, yes! Um...

39:09.225 --> 39:11.854
Mmm! Exquisite.
What do you call this dish?

39:11.938 --> 39:15.064
That would be the dog's breakfast,
Your Majesty.

39:15.146 --> 39:18.903
Ah, yes. Very good, then.
Carry on, Cedric.

39:18.986 --> 39:23.074
- Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek?
- No, l haven't, dear.

39:23.157 --> 39:26.993
l'm sure he just went off to look for
a nice... mud hole to cool down in.

39:27.077 --> 39:29.329
You know, after your
little spat last night.

39:29.413 --> 39:31.707
Oh. You heard that, huh?

39:31.790 --> 39:33.500
The whole kingdom heard you.

39:33.543 --> 39:36.378
l mean, after all,
it is in his nature to be...

39:36.461 --> 39:37.963
well, a bit of a brute.

39:38.045 --> 39:42.217
Him? You know, you didn't exactly
roll out the Welcome Wagon.

39:42.300 --> 39:45.719
Well, what did you expect?
Look at what he's done to you.

39:46.471 --> 39:49.475
Shrek loves me for who l am.

39:49.559 --> 39:52.186
l would think you'd be happy for me.

39:52.228 --> 39:55.688
Darling, l'm just thinking about
what's best for you.

39:55.730 --> 39:59.025
Maybe you should do the same.

40:12.581 --> 40:14.208
No, really?

40:16.293 --> 40:18.170
Shh...

40:19.880 --> 40:21.633
Oh...

40:25.260 --> 40:29.474
Oh, no. That's the old Keebler's place.
Let's back away slowly.

40:29.557 --> 40:31.474
That's the Fairy Godmother's cottage.

40:31.558 --> 40:35.019
She's the largest producer of hexes
and potions in the whole kingdom.

40:35.103 --> 40:38.732
Then why don't we pop in there
for a spell? Ha-ha! Spell!

40:43.906 --> 40:45.656
He makes me laugh.

40:51.079 --> 40:53.372
Hi. l'm here to see the...

40:53.455 --> 40:56.458
The Fairy Godmother.
l'm sorry. She is not in.

40:56.541 --> 40:59.502
Jerome!
Coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now!

41:00.880 --> 41:04.093
Yes, Fairy Godmother.
Right away.

41:04.134 --> 41:06.927
Look, she's not seeing
any clients today, OK?

41:06.969 --> 41:09.180
That's OK, buddy.
We're from the union.

41:09.264 --> 41:10.222
The union?

41:10.305 --> 41:14.728
We represent the workers in all magical
industries, both evil and benign.

41:14.811 --> 41:16.520
Oh! Oh, right.

41:16.645 --> 41:19.690
Are you feeling at all
degraded or oppressed?

41:19.773 --> 41:23.444
Uh... a little.
We don't even have dental.

41:23.485 --> 41:25.196
They don't even have dental.

41:25.279 --> 41:27.613
Okay, we'll just have
a look around.

41:27.655 --> 41:28.866
Oh. By the way.

41:28.950 --> 41:32.286
l think it'd be better if the Fairy Godmother
didn't know we were here.

41:32.328 --> 41:35.415
- Know what l'm saying? Huh?
- Huh? Huh? Huh?

41:35.540 --> 41:38.793
- Stop it.
- Of course. Go right in.

42:08.197 --> 42:09.907
A drop of desire.

42:10.991 --> 42:12.826
Naughty!

42:14.037 --> 42:15.664
A pinch of passion.

42:20.877 --> 42:23.254
And just a hint of...

42:23.878 --> 42:25.048
lust!

42:28.593 --> 42:30.552
Excuse me.

42:30.636 --> 42:32.346
Sorry to barge in like this...

42:32.388 --> 42:35.557
What in Grimm's name
are you doing here?

42:35.641 --> 42:40.603
Well, it seems
that Fiona's not exactly happy.

42:40.687 --> 42:42.023
Oh-ho-ho!

42:42.064 --> 42:44.692
And there's some question
as to why that is?

42:45.569 --> 42:47.737
Well, let's explore that, shall we?

42:49.404 --> 42:53.326
Ah. P, P, P...
Princess. Cinderella.

42:53.493 --> 42:56.621
Here we are.
''Lived happily ever after.'' Oh...

42:56.705 --> 42:58.872
No ogres!

42:58.914 --> 43:00.376
Let's see. Snow White.

43:00.417 --> 43:04.211
A handsome prince.
Oh, no ogres.

43:04.253 --> 43:06.547
Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres!

43:06.589 --> 43:09.757
Hansel and Gretel? No!
Thumbelina? No.

43:09.840 --> 43:12.804
The Golden Bird,
the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman...

43:12.888 --> 43:15.557
No, no, no, no, no!

43:15.598 --> 43:20.018
You see, ogres don't
live happily ever after.

43:20.102 --> 43:21.729
All right, look, lady!

43:21.770 --> 43:25.484
Don't you point...
those dirty green sausages at me!

43:26.943 --> 43:28.694
Your Monte Cristo and coffee.

43:28.778 --> 43:30.278
Oh! Sorry.

43:30.362 --> 43:32.406
Ah... that's okay.

43:32.489 --> 43:34.783
We were just leaving.

43:34.866 --> 43:37.539
Very sorry to have wasted your time,
Miss Godmother.

43:37.622 --> 43:39.414
Just... go.

43:39.456 --> 43:40.791
Come on, guys.

43:56.681 --> 43:58.598
TGlF, eh, buddy?

44:00.601 --> 44:03.271
Working hard or hardly working,
eh, Mac?

44:12.488 --> 44:16.075
Get your fine Corinthian footwear
and your cat cheeks out of my face!

44:16.158 --> 44:18.120
Man, that stinks!

44:18.162 --> 44:21.413
You don't exactly smell like
a basket of roses.

44:24.333 --> 44:28.922
- Well, one of these has got to help.
- l was just concocting this very plan!

44:29.005 --> 44:32.093
Already our minds are becoming one.

44:32.176 --> 44:37.055
Whoa, whoa. lf we need an expert on
licking ourselves, we'll give you a call.

44:37.138 --> 44:38.765
Shrek, this is a bad idea.

44:38.849 --> 44:42.061
Look. Make yourself useful
and go keep watch.

44:42.144 --> 44:45.479
Puss, do you think you
could get to those on top?

44:45.522 --> 44:47.607
No problema, boss.
ln one of my nine lives,

44:47.690 --> 44:50.568
l was the great cat burglar
of Santiago de Compostela.

44:50.652 --> 44:51.943
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

44:52.027 --> 44:53.405
Shrek, are you off your nut?

44:53.488 --> 44:55.074
Donkey, keep watch.

44:55.157 --> 44:57.117
Keep watch?
Yeah, l'll keep watch.

44:57.201 --> 45:01.287
l'll watch that wicked witch come and
whammy a world of hurt up your backside.

45:01.371 --> 45:04.290
l'll laugh, too.
l'll be giggling to myself.

45:04.374 --> 45:07.126
- What do you see?
- Toad Stool Softener?

45:07.209 --> 45:11.255
l'm sure a nice BM is the perfect solution
for marital problems.

45:11.339 --> 45:13.258
- Elfa Seltzer?
- Uh-uh.

45:13.341 --> 45:16.802
- Hex Lax?
- No! Try ''handsome.''

45:17.761 --> 45:19.223
Sorry. No handsome.

45:20.515 --> 45:23.560
Hey! How about ''Happily Ever After''?

45:23.644 --> 45:25.771
Well, what does it do?

45:26.439 --> 45:29.190
lt says ''Beauty Divine.''

45:29.232 --> 45:32.652
ln some cultures, donkeys are revered
as the wisest of creatures.

45:32.735 --> 45:34.279
Especially us talking ones.

45:34.362 --> 45:36.490
Donkey!

45:38.115 --> 45:40.035
That'll have to do.
We've got company.

45:47.501 --> 45:48.794
Can we get on with this?

45:52.088 --> 45:53.716
Hurry!

46:02.306 --> 46:03.768
Nice catch, Donkey!

46:03.934 --> 46:05.852
Finally! A good use for your mouth.

46:10.316 --> 46:11.316
Come on!

46:17.281 --> 46:19.908
# You spurn my natural emotions

46:19.992 --> 46:23.786
# You make me feel like dirt
and I'm hurt

46:28.208 --> 46:30.669
# And if I start a commotion

46:30.753 --> 46:34.382
# I run the risk of losing you
and that's worse

46:38.010 --> 46:41.764
# Ever fallen in love with someone,
ever fallen in love

46:41.807 --> 46:44.348
# In love with someone,
ever fallen in love

46:44.433 --> 46:47.728
# In love with someone
you shouldn't have fallen in love with

46:54.275 --> 46:57.737
# Ever fallen in love with someone,
ever fallen in love

46:57.820 --> 47:00.575
# In love with someone,
ever fallen in love

47:00.659 --> 47:03.160
# With someone
you shouldn't have fallen in love with

47:04.620 --> 47:06.455
# Fallen in love with

47:07.665 --> 47:12.295
# Ever fallen in love with someone
you shouldn't have fallen in love with #

47:13.045 --> 47:17.756
l don't care whose fault it is.
Just get this place cleaned up!

47:17.841 --> 47:22.680
And somebody bring me something
deep fried and smothered in chocolate!

47:23.640 --> 47:27.143
- Mother!
- Charming. Sweetheart.

47:27.226 --> 47:30.688
This isn't a good time, pumpkin.
Mama's working.

47:30.771 --> 47:32.898
Whoa, what happened here?

47:32.981 --> 47:36.068
- The ogre, that's what!
- What? Where is he, Mom?

47:36.152 --> 47:38.653
l shall rend his head
from his shoulders!

47:38.737 --> 47:41.156
l will smite him where he stands!

47:41.198 --> 47:45.243
He will rue the very day he stole
my kingdom from me!

47:45.995 --> 47:49.832
Oh, put it away, Junior!
You're still going to be king.

47:49.873 --> 47:52.503
We'll just have to come up
with something smarter.

47:52.586 --> 47:54.629
Pardon. Um...

47:54.713 --> 47:58.966
Everything is accounted for,
Fairy Godmother, except for one potion.

47:59.049 --> 48:00.092
What?

48:01.135 --> 48:02.136
Oh...

48:03.013 --> 48:06.223
l do believe we can make
this work to our advantage.

48:08.016 --> 48:11.728
''Happily Ever After Potion.
Maximum strength.

48:11.811 --> 48:14.439
''For you and your true love.

48:14.522 --> 48:17.193
''lf one of you drinks this,
you both will be fine.

48:17.277 --> 48:20.112
''Happiness, comfort
and beauty divine.''

48:20.195 --> 48:23.908
- You both will be fine?
- l guess it means it'll affect Fiona, too.

48:24.951 --> 48:28.620
Hey, man, this don't feel right.
My donkey senses are tingling all over.

48:28.703 --> 48:31.665
Drop that jug o' voodoo
and let's get out of here.

48:31.748 --> 48:35.169
lt says, ''Beauty Divine.''
How bad can it be?

48:37.213 --> 48:40.174
See, you're allergic to that stuff.
You'll have a reaction.

48:40.341 --> 48:44.679
And if you think that l'll be smearing
Vapor Rub over your chest, think again!

48:44.762 --> 48:47.806
Boss, just in case there is something
wrong with the potion...

48:47.890 --> 48:49.809
allow me to take the first sip.

48:49.892 --> 48:53.354
lt would be an honor to lay my life
on the line for you.

48:53.438 --> 48:55.565
Oh, no, no. l don't think so.

48:55.648 --> 48:58.233
lf there'll be any animal testing,
l'll do it.

48:58.317 --> 49:01.403
That's the best friend's job.
Now give me that bottle.

49:06.700 --> 49:08.493
How do you feel?

49:09.329 --> 49:12.791
l don't feel any different.
l look any different?

49:12.832 --> 49:14.999
You still look like an ass to me.

49:15.084 --> 49:18.129
Maybe it doesn't work on donkeys.

49:19.046 --> 49:22.967
- Well, here's to us, Fiona.
- Shrek?

49:23.050 --> 49:26.762
- You drink that, there's no going back.
- l know.

49:26.804 --> 49:28.723
- No more wallowing in the mud?
- l know.

49:28.806 --> 49:30.473
- No more itchy butt crack?
- l know!

49:30.556 --> 49:32.935
- But you love being an ogre!
- l know!

49:36.690 --> 49:38.650
But l love Fiona more.

49:39.984 --> 49:41.861
Shrek, no! Wait!

49:54.623 --> 49:59.087
Got to be... l think you grabbed
the ''Farty Ever After'' potion.

49:59.171 --> 50:00.962
Maybe it's a dud.

50:01.005 --> 50:04.051
Or maybe Fiona and l
were never meant to be.

50:07.678 --> 50:11.306
Uh-oh. What did l tell you?
l feel something coming on.

50:11.348 --> 50:14.686
l don't want to die.
l don't want to die. l don't want to die!

50:14.769 --> 50:18.105
Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy.
l'm melting!

50:18.189 --> 50:20.274
l'm melting!

50:20.357 --> 50:22.276
lt's just the rain, Donkey.

50:23.235 --> 50:25.698
Oh.

51:07.238 --> 51:10.200
Don't worry. Things seem bad
because it's dark and rainy

51:10.242 --> 51:12.868
and Fiona's father hired
a sleazy hitman to whack you.

51:13.994 --> 51:17.000
lt'll be better in the morning.
You'll see...

51:17.167 --> 51:20.210
# The sun'll come out...

51:20.293 --> 51:22.086
# Tomorrow

51:23.255 --> 51:24.880
# Bet your bottom... #

51:25.005 --> 51:26.800
Bet my bottom?

51:26.885 --> 51:28.217
l'm coming, Elizabeth!

51:28.258 --> 51:29.969
Donkey?

51:30.052 --> 51:31.929
Are you all right?

51:32.014 --> 51:35.892
- Hey, boss. Let's shave him.
- D-Donkey?

51:45.276 --> 51:47.696
There you are!
We missed you at dinner.

51:49.072 --> 51:50.531
What is it, darling?

51:50.615 --> 51:52.241
Dad...

51:52.324 --> 51:54.661
l've been thinking
about what you said.

51:55.618 --> 51:57.540
And l'm going to set things right.

51:57.664 --> 52:00.166
Ah! Excellent!
That's my girl.

52:00.249 --> 52:02.961
lt was a mistake to bring Shrek here.

52:03.044 --> 52:05.795
l'm going to go out and find him.

52:05.879 --> 52:08.967
And then we'll go back
to the swamp where we belong.

52:12.178 --> 52:13.970
Fiona, please!

52:14.055 --> 52:17.059
Let's not be rash, darling.
You can't go anywhere right now.

52:19.937 --> 52:21.144
Fiona!

53:01.019 --> 53:05.941
Look, l told you he was here.
Look at him! Quiet. Look at him.

53:08.318 --> 53:09.861
Good morning, sleepyhead.

53:11.029 --> 53:12.530
Good morning!

53:12.613 --> 53:14.158
We love your kitty!

53:14.241 --> 53:17.994
- Oh... My head...
- Here, l fetched a pail of water.

53:18.036 --> 53:19.621
Thanks.

53:19.705 --> 53:20.705
Uhh!

53:23.209 --> 53:24.793
Aahh!

53:24.877 --> 53:25.836
Oh...

53:27.671 --> 53:30.339
A cute button nose?

53:30.382 --> 53:32.425
Thick, wavy locks?

53:33.343 --> 53:35.345
Taut, round buttocks?

53:36.180 --> 53:37.721
l'm... l'm...

53:37.805 --> 53:39.140
- Gorgeous!
- l'll say.

53:39.182 --> 53:40.892
l'm Jill. What's your name?

53:40.975 --> 53:45.146
- Um... Shrek.
- Shrek? Wow. Are you from Europe?

53:45.188 --> 53:47.523
- You're tense.
- l want to rub his shoulders.

53:47.607 --> 53:50.361
- l got it covered.
- l don't have anything to rub.

53:50.444 --> 53:52.030
Get in line.

53:52.070 --> 53:55.032
- Have you seen my donkey?
- Who are you calling donkey?

53:56.200 --> 53:59.953
- Donkey? You're a...
- A stallion, baby!

54:00.079 --> 54:01.079
l can whinny.

54:01.162 --> 54:03.288
l can count.

54:03.623 --> 54:06.543
Look at me, Shrek!
l'm trotting!

54:07.210 --> 54:10.340
That's some quality potion.
What's in that stuff?

54:10.423 --> 54:13.590
''Oh, don't take the potion,
Mr. Boss, it's very bad.''

54:13.674 --> 54:14.761
Pah!

54:14.844 --> 54:19.347
''Warning: Side effects may include
burning, itching, oozing, weeping.

54:19.473 --> 54:23.018
''Not intended for heart patients
or those with... nervous disorders.''

54:23.102 --> 54:26.187
l'm trotting, l'm trotting in place! Yeah!

54:28.273 --> 54:29.448
What?

54:29.483 --> 54:33.153
Señor? ''To make the effects
of this potion permanent,

54:33.236 --> 54:36.822
''the drinker must obtain his
true love's kiss by midnight.''

54:36.905 --> 54:39.242
Midnight?
Why is it always midnight?

54:39.283 --> 54:42.122
- Pick me! l'll be your true love!
- l'll be your true love.

54:42.204 --> 54:44.707
l'll be true... enough.

54:44.873 --> 54:48.252
Look, ladies, l already have a true love.

54:48.335 --> 54:49.378
Oh...

54:49.461 --> 54:51.004
And take it from me, Boss.

54:51.089 --> 54:54.216
You are going to have
one satisfied Princess.

54:54.257 --> 54:56.926
And let's face it.
You are a lot easier on the eyes.

54:56.968 --> 54:59.428
lnside you're the same
old mean, salty...

54:59.512 --> 55:01.515
- Easy.
- ...cantankerous, foul,

55:01.599 --> 55:03.391
angry ogre you always been.

55:03.475 --> 55:05.644
And you're still the same
annoying donkey.

55:05.727 --> 55:08.314
Yeah.

55:08.398 --> 55:09.939
Well...

55:10.608 --> 55:14.444
Look out, Princess.
Here comes the new me.

55:15.112 --> 55:16.488
First things first.

55:16.572 --> 55:19.074
We need to get you out of those clothes.

55:22.827 --> 55:24.454
- Ready?
- Ready!

55:28.290 --> 55:30.376
Driver, stop!

55:30.502 --> 55:33.590
Oh, God! Help me, please!
My racing days are over!

55:33.674 --> 55:35.382
l'm blind! Tell the truth.

55:35.465 --> 55:37.176
Will l ever play the violin again?

55:37.259 --> 55:38.969
You poor creature!

55:39.053 --> 55:41.305
ls there anything
l can do for you?

55:41.347 --> 55:43.598
Well, l guess there is one thing.

55:43.682 --> 55:46.644
Take off the powdered wig
and step away from your drawers.

55:50.689 --> 55:52.984
- Not bad.
- Not bad at all.

56:00.950 --> 56:04.287
Father?
ls everything all right, Father?

56:09.542 --> 56:13.463
Thank you, gentlemen!
Someday, l will repay you.

56:13.504 --> 56:17.049
Unless, of course,
l can't find you or if l forget.

56:23.972 --> 56:24.974
# Oh, yeah

56:35.901 --> 56:38.028
# Turn and face the strange

56:38.111 --> 56:40.239
# Ch-Ch-Changes

a different man

# Time may change me

56:55.381 --> 56:58.507
# But I can't trace time

57:00.801 --> 57:01.802
Halt!

57:01.886 --> 57:05.348
Tell Princess Fiona her husband,
Sir Shrek, is here to see her.

57:09.977 --> 57:13.273
# Still don't know what
I was looking for

57:13.356 --> 57:18.861
# And my time was running wild,
a million dead-end streets

57:18.944 --> 57:22.030
# Every time I thought
I'd got it made

57:22.114 --> 57:24.743
# It seemed the taste
was not so sweet

57:24.826 --> 57:26.869
# Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes

57:26.953 --> 57:28.537
# Turn and face the strange

57:28.580 --> 57:31.208
- Shrek?
- # Ch-Ch-Changes

57:31.291 --> 57:34.000
# Don't wanna be a richer one

57:34.083 --> 57:36.837

57:36.921 --> 57:39.550
# But I can't trace time

57:39.591 --> 57:40.590
Fiona?

57:43.969 --> 57:45.888
Hello, handsome.

57:47.682 --> 57:49.058
Shrek!

57:49.183 --> 57:52.478
- Princess!
- Donkey?

57:52.561 --> 57:54.729
Wow! That potion
worked on you, too?

57:54.814 --> 57:56.064
What potion?

57:56.147 --> 57:59.318
Shrek and l took some magic potion.
And well...

57:59.401 --> 58:01.613
Now, we're sexy!

58:02.904 --> 58:03.990
Shrek?

58:08.202 --> 58:10.831
For you, baby... l could be.

58:10.996 --> 58:13.248
- Yeah, you wish.
- Donkey, where is Shrek?

58:13.373 --> 58:15.627
He went inside looking for you.

58:17.503 --> 58:18.504
Shrek?

58:19.463 --> 58:22.091
Fiona! Fiona!

58:24.009 --> 58:26.179
You want to dance, pretty boy?

58:29.014 --> 58:32.686
Are you going so soon?
Don't you want to see your wife?

58:34.020 --> 58:35.021
Fiona?

58:37.482 --> 58:38.691
Shrek?

58:38.774 --> 58:41.610
Aye, Fiona. lt is me.

58:41.652 --> 58:43.362
What happened to your voice?

58:43.445 --> 58:47.576
The potion changed
a lot of things, Fiona.

58:47.659 --> 58:50.287
But not the way l feel about you.

58:50.370 --> 58:51.828
Fiona?

58:52.664 --> 58:55.583
- Charming?
- Do you think so?

58:55.667 --> 58:59.503
Dad. l was so hoping
you'd approve.

58:59.546 --> 59:03.175
- Um... Who are you?
- Mom, it's me, Shrek.

59:03.258 --> 59:06.679
l know you never get a second chance
at a first impression,

59:06.846 --> 59:09.263
but, well, what do you think?

59:13.519 --> 59:16.186
Fiona! Fiona!

59:17.853 --> 59:19.523
Fiona!

59:19.607 --> 59:23.612
- Fiona!
- Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho!

59:23.696 --> 59:27.200
Oh, shoot! l don't think they
can hear us, pigeon.

59:29.826 --> 59:33.205
Don't you think you've already
messed her life up enough?

59:34.080 --> 59:36.166
l just wanted her to be happy.

59:36.250 --> 59:38.543
And now she can be.

59:38.627 --> 59:40.629
Oh, sweetheart.

59:40.712 --> 59:44.548
She's finally found
the prince of her dreams.

59:44.632 --> 59:48.678
But look at me.
Look what l've done for her.

59:48.762 --> 59:52.056
lt's time you stop living
in a fairy tale, Shrek.

59:52.139 --> 59:56.311
She's a princess,
and you're an ogre.

59:56.394 --> 01:00:00.398
That's something no amount
of potion will ever change.

01:00:07.781 --> 01:00:09.658
But...

01:00:09.741 --> 01:00:11.242
l love her.

01:00:11.326 --> 01:00:14.163
lf you really love her...

01:00:14.245 --> 01:00:16.289
you'll let her go.

01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:22.213
Shrek?

01:00:22.296 --> 01:00:23.380
Señor.

01:00:23.463 --> 01:00:26.466
What's going on?
Where are you going?

01:00:32.681 --> 01:00:37.103
You wouldn't have had anything to do
with this, would you, Harold?

01:00:42.316 --> 01:00:45.403
# People just ain't no good

01:00:48.153 --> 01:00:51.574
# I think that's well understood

01:00:51.615 --> 01:00:53.284
There you go, boys.

01:00:53.368 --> 01:00:55.329
Just leave the bottle, Doris.

01:00:55.413 --> 01:00:57.789
Hey. Why the long face?

01:00:58.791 --> 01:01:01.417
lt was all just a stupid mistake.

01:01:02.335 --> 01:01:06.173
l never should have rescued her
from that tower in the first place.

01:01:08.384 --> 01:01:10.302
l hate Mondays.

01:01:10.344 --> 01:01:14.014
l can't believe you'd walk away from
the best thing that happened to you.

01:01:14.097 --> 01:01:15.683
What choice do l have?

01:01:15.766 --> 01:01:19.228
She loves that pretty boy,
Prince Charming.

01:01:19.312 --> 01:01:21.396
Come on. ls he really
that good-looking?

01:01:21.479 --> 01:01:23.940
Are you kidding?
He's gorgeous!

01:01:24.023 --> 01:01:27.235
He has a face that looks like
it was carved by angels.

01:01:27.317 --> 01:01:29.905
- Oh. He sounds dreamy.
- You know...

01:01:29.989 --> 01:01:33.326
shockingly, this isn't
making me feel any better.

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:40.123
Look, guys.
lt's for the best.

01:01:40.165 --> 01:01:41.584
Mom and Dad approve,

01:01:41.667 --> 01:01:45.003
and Fiona gets the man
she's always dreamed of.

01:01:45.087 --> 01:01:46.963
Everybody wins.

01:01:48.006 --> 01:01:49.257
Except for you.

01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:52.634
l don't get it, Shrek.
You love Fiona.

01:01:52.676 --> 01:01:54.054
Aye.

01:01:55.056 --> 01:01:57.641
And that's why
l have to let her go.

01:01:58.434 --> 01:02:01.478
Excuse me, is she here?

01:02:01.563 --> 01:02:03.730
She's, uh... in the back.

01:02:05.024 --> 01:02:06.817
Oh, hello again.

01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:13.156
Fairy Godmother. Charming.

01:02:13.238 --> 01:02:17.577
You'd better have a good reason
for dragging us down here, Harold.

01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:23.458
Well, l'm afraid Fiona isn't really...
warming up to Prince Charming.

01:02:23.541 --> 01:02:27.045
- FYl, not my fault.
- No, of course it's not, dear.

01:02:27.213 --> 01:02:29.006
l mean,
how charming can l be

01:02:29.047 --> 01:02:31.466
when l have to pretend
l'm that dreadful ogre?

01:02:31.550 --> 01:02:33.594
No, no, it's nobody's fault.

01:02:33.677 --> 01:02:37.056
Perhaps it's best if we just
call the whole thing off, okay?

01:02:37.097 --> 01:02:41.435
- What?
- You can't force someone to fall in love!

01:02:41.518 --> 01:02:44.731
l beg to differ.
l do it all the time!

01:02:44.772 --> 01:02:49.234
Have Fiona drink this and she'll fall in love
with the first man she kisses,

01:02:49.276 --> 01:02:51.238
which will be Charming.

01:02:52.361 --> 01:02:55.365
- Umm... no.
- What did you say?

01:02:55.449 --> 01:02:57.827
l can't. l won't do it.

01:02:57.910 --> 01:02:59.494
Oh, yes, you will.

01:02:59.578 --> 01:03:03.166
lf you remember, l helped you
with your happily ever after.

01:03:03.249 --> 01:03:06.794
And l can take it away
just as easily.

01:03:06.877 --> 01:03:10.089
ls that what you want? ls it?

01:03:11.090 --> 01:03:13.552
- No.
- Good boy.

01:03:13.635 --> 01:03:15.387
Now, we have to go.

01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:17.721
l need to do Charming's hair
before the ball.

01:03:17.763 --> 01:03:20.057
He's hopeless.
He's all high in the front.

01:03:20.098 --> 01:03:22.934
He can never get to the back.
You need someone to do the back.

01:03:23.019 --> 01:03:24.686
Oh. Thank you, Mother.

01:03:24.769 --> 01:03:26.605
Mother?

01:03:26.647 --> 01:03:29.816
Um... Mary! A talking horse!

01:03:29.899 --> 01:03:30.900
The ogre!

01:03:32.777 --> 01:03:36.782
Stop them! Thieves! Bandits!
Stop them!

01:03:38.451 --> 01:03:41.412
The abs are fab
and it's gluteus to the maximus

01:03:41.495 --> 01:03:44.874
here at tonight's Far, Far Away
Royal Ball blowout!

01:03:44.957 --> 01:03:48.042
The coaches are lined up
as the cream of the crop pours out of them

01:03:48.126 --> 01:03:49.878
like Miss Muffet's curds and whey.

01:03:49.962 --> 01:03:51.921
Everyone who's anyone
has turned out

01:03:51.963 --> 01:03:54.508
to honor Princess Fiona
and Prince Shrek.

01:03:54.592 --> 01:03:57.594
And, oh my,
the outfits look gorgeous!

01:03:57.677 --> 01:03:59.055
Look! Hansel and Gretel!

01:03:59.971 --> 01:04:01.766
What the heck are the crumbs for?

01:04:01.807 --> 01:04:04.894
And right behind them,
Tom Thumb and Thumbelina!

01:04:04.977 --> 01:04:07.647
Oh, aren't they adorable!

01:04:07.689 --> 01:04:10.815
Here comes Sleeping Beauty!

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:12.819
Tired old thing.

01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:16.488
Who's this? Who's this?
Who is this?

01:04:16.529 --> 01:04:19.701
Oh. lt's the one, it's the only...

01:04:19.784 --> 01:04:22.369
lt's the Fairy Godmother!

01:04:22.453 --> 01:04:25.663
Hello, Far, Far Away!

01:04:26.875 --> 01:04:29.001
Can l get a whoop whoop?

01:04:30.337 --> 01:04:33.756
May all your endings be happy and...

01:04:33.839 --> 01:04:36.926
Well, you know the rest!

01:04:37.009 --> 01:04:39.971
We'll be right back with the Royal
Far, Far Away Ball

01:04:40.054 --> 01:04:41.972
after these messages.

01:04:42.014 --> 01:04:43.641
l hate these ball shows.

01:04:43.808 --> 01:04:46.894
They bore me to tears.
Flip over to Wheel Of Torture!

01:04:46.977 --> 01:04:50.606
l'm not flipping anywhere, sir,
until l see Shrek and Fiona.

01:04:50.689 --> 01:04:53.359
Whizzes on you guys.

01:04:53.402 --> 01:04:55.529
Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing!

01:04:55.612 --> 01:04:57.864
No, to your left. Your left!

01:05:00.908 --> 01:05:04.079
- Tonight on ''Knights''...
- Now here's a good show!

01:05:04.162 --> 01:05:07.581
We got a white bronco heading east
into the forest. Requesting backup.

01:05:07.664 --> 01:05:09.749
It's time to teach these madcap mammals

01:05:09.833 --> 01:05:12.544
their ''devil may mare'' attitudes
just won't fly.

01:05:13.962 --> 01:05:17.717
Why you grabbing me?
Police brutality!

01:05:18.885 --> 01:05:20.929
l have to talk to Princess Fiona!

01:05:21.013 --> 01:05:23.057
- We warned you!
- Ow! Ow!

01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:25.600
Did someone let the cat out of the bag?

01:05:25.683 --> 01:05:27.685
You capitalist pig dogs!

01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:34.859
- Catnip!
- That's not mine.

01:05:35.943 --> 01:05:38.028
Find Princess Fiona!

01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:39.781
l'm a donkey!

01:05:39.864 --> 01:05:42.532
Tell her Shrek...
l'm her husband, Shrek!

01:05:43.702 --> 01:05:45.162
Quick! Rewind it!

01:05:46.163 --> 01:05:48.665
l'm her husband, Shrek! Ow!

01:06:16.566 --> 01:06:17.568
Darling?

01:06:18.611 --> 01:06:20.571
Ah. l thought l might
find you here.

01:06:20.614 --> 01:06:24.241
How about a nice hot cup
of tea before the ball?

01:06:25.451 --> 01:06:26.784
l'm not going.

01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:29.914
The whole Kingdom's turned out
to celebrate your marriage.

01:06:29.956 --> 01:06:33.919
There's just one problem.
That's not my husband.

01:06:35.128 --> 01:06:36.795
l mean, look at him.

01:06:39.090 --> 01:06:40.592
Yes, he is a bit different,

01:06:40.634 --> 01:06:43.719
but people change
for the ones they love.

01:06:43.802 --> 01:06:47.013
You'd be surprised how much
l changed for your mother.

01:06:47.097 --> 01:06:48.848
Change?

01:06:48.932 --> 01:06:51.143
He's completely lost his mind!

01:06:51.185 --> 01:06:54.772
Why not come down to the ball
and give him another chance?

01:06:54.814 --> 01:06:57.733
You might find you like
this new Shrek.

01:06:57.817 --> 01:07:01.072
But it's the old one
l fell in love with, Dad.

01:07:02.112 --> 01:07:04.198
l'd give anything to have him back.

01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:10.455
Darling. That's mine. Decaf.

01:07:10.622 --> 01:07:12.497
Otherwise l'm up all night.

01:07:19.422 --> 01:07:21.048
Thanks.

01:07:23.509 --> 01:07:25.011
l got to get out of here!

01:07:25.094 --> 01:07:27.764
You can't lock us up like this!
Let me go!

01:07:27.847 --> 01:07:29.307
What about my Miranda rights?

01:07:29.391 --> 01:07:32.185
You're supposed to say
l have the right to remain silent.

01:07:32.227 --> 01:07:34.479
Nobody said l have the right
to remain silent!

01:07:34.521 --> 01:07:37.107
You have the right to remain silent.

01:07:37.233 --> 01:07:39.776
What you lack is the capacity.

01:07:39.859 --> 01:07:43.361
l must hold on before l, too,
go totally mad.

01:07:43.444 --> 01:07:45.739
Shrek? Donkey?

01:07:46.741 --> 01:07:48.200
Too late.

01:07:48.324 --> 01:07:51.537
Gingy! Pinocchio!
Get us out of here!

01:07:51.663 --> 01:07:52.873
Oh...

01:07:57.126 --> 01:07:58.963
Fire in ze hole!

01:08:17.814 --> 01:08:19.106
Look out below!

01:08:21.568 --> 01:08:23.569
Quick! Tell a lie!

01:08:23.611 --> 01:08:26.363
- What should l say?
- Anything, but quick!

01:08:26.490 --> 01:08:29.493
Say something crazy like
''l'm wearing ladies' underwear!''

01:08:29.576 --> 01:08:31.660
l am wearing ladies' underwear.

01:08:35.497 --> 01:08:38.126
- Are you?
- l most certainly am not!

01:08:39.085 --> 01:08:41.421
lt looks like you
most certainly am are!

01:08:41.462 --> 01:08:43.048
- l am not!
- What kind?

01:08:43.089 --> 01:08:45.718
- lt's a thong!
- Oww! They're briefs!

01:08:45.841 --> 01:08:47.176
- Are not.
- Are too!

01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:48.971
- Are not!
- Are too!

01:08:49.054 --> 01:08:50.763
Here we go. Hang tight.

01:08:54.265 --> 01:08:57.228
Wait, wait, wait!
Ow! Ow! Hey, hey, hey!

01:08:57.937 --> 01:08:58.897
Ow!

01:09:01.274 --> 01:09:03.609
- Excuse me?
- What? Puss!

01:09:03.652 --> 01:09:05.819
Pardon me, would you
mind letting me go?

01:09:05.904 --> 01:09:07.823
- Sorry, boss.
- Quit messing around!

01:09:07.907 --> 01:09:09.741
We've got to stop that kiss!

01:09:09.782 --> 01:09:11.658
l thought you was going
to let her go.

01:09:11.743 --> 01:09:14.037
l was, but l can't let them
do this to Fiona.

01:09:14.121 --> 01:09:17.332
Boom! That's what l like to hear.
Look who's coming around!

01:09:17.415 --> 01:09:19.209
lt's impossible!
We'll never get in.

01:09:19.292 --> 01:09:22.254
The castle's guarded.
There's a moat and everything!

01:09:22.337 --> 01:09:28.218
Folks, it looks like we're up chocolate
creek without a Popsicle stick.

01:09:32.471 --> 01:09:36.310
- What?
- Do you still know the Muffin Man?

01:09:36.352 --> 01:09:39.856
Well, sure!
He's down on Drury Lane. Why?

01:09:39.939 --> 01:09:42.398
Because we're gonna need flour.

01:09:42.481 --> 01:09:45.526
Lots and lots of flour.

01:09:47.821 --> 01:09:50.323
Gingy!

01:09:50.365 --> 01:09:54.786
Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man!
We've got a big order to fill!

01:09:58.790 --> 01:10:00.751
lt's alive!

01:10:08.925 --> 01:10:12.763
Run, run, run,
as fast you can!

01:10:19.977 --> 01:10:22.105
Go, baby, go!

01:10:23.608 --> 01:10:26.567
There it is, Mongo!
To the castle!

01:10:26.650 --> 01:10:31.032
No, you great stupid pastry!
Come on!

01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:41.541
Mongo! Down here!
Look at the pony!

01:10:43.125 --> 01:10:45.503
That's right! Follow the pretty pony!

01:10:45.629 --> 01:10:48.090
Pretty pony wants to play
at the castle!

01:10:48.173 --> 01:10:49.841
Pretty pony.

01:10:51.511 --> 01:10:53.429
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:10:53.512 --> 01:10:58.267
Presenting Princess Fiona
and her new husband, Prince Shrek.

01:11:00.727 --> 01:11:02.898
Shrek, what are you doing?

01:11:02.939 --> 01:11:06.192
l'm just playing the part, Fiona.

01:11:06.233 --> 01:11:08.151
ls that glitter on your lips?

01:11:08.235 --> 01:11:11.155
Mm. Cherry flavored.
Want to taste?

01:11:11.239 --> 01:11:15.075
- Ugh! What is with you?
- But, Muffin Cake...

01:11:17.997 --> 01:11:20.247
C Minor, put it in C Minor.

01:11:21.331 --> 01:11:22.790
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:11:25.376 --> 01:11:28.298
l'd like to dedicate this song to...

01:11:28.381 --> 01:11:31.842
Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.

01:11:32.842 --> 01:11:34.594
Fiona, my Princess.

01:11:34.677 --> 01:11:37.221
Will you honor me with a dance?

01:11:37.805 --> 01:11:42.355
# Where have all the good men gone

01:11:42.438 --> 01:11:45.273
# And where are all the gods?

01:11:45.355 --> 01:11:46.482
Dance!

01:11:46.566 --> 01:11:50.278
# Where's the streetwise Hercules

01:11:50.444 --> 01:11:54.031
# To fight the rising odds?

01:11:57.285 --> 01:11:58.659
Since when do you dance?

01:11:58.743 --> 01:12:01.622
Fiona, my dearest,
if there's one thing l know,

01:12:01.705 --> 01:12:04.999
it's that love is full of surprises.

01:12:05.082 --> 01:12:07.628
# Late at night I toss and I turn

01:12:07.712 --> 01:12:12.258
# And I dream of what I need

01:12:14.968 --> 01:12:16.471
Hit it!

01:12:19.222 --> 01:12:20.891
# I need a hero

01:12:20.974 --> 01:12:25.019
All right, big fella!
Let's crash this party!

01:12:26.438 --> 01:12:28.190
Man the catapults!

01:12:28.816 --> 01:12:30.984
Aim! Fire!

01:12:32.112 --> 01:12:35.282
- Brace yourselves!
- Ooh! Purty!

01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:44.833
Not the gumdrop button!

01:12:51.254 --> 01:12:53.048
lncoming!

01:12:54.174 --> 01:12:55.760
Ha-ha! All right!

01:12:58.679 --> 01:13:04.435
# Somewhere after midnight
In my wildest fantasy

01:13:04.518 --> 01:13:06.187
Go, Mongo! Go!

01:13:09.814 --> 01:13:12.026
Man the cauldrons!

01:13:16.864 --> 01:13:18.866
After you, Mongo.

01:13:21.576 --> 01:13:25.873
- That's it! Heave-ho!
- Watch out!

01:13:28.668 --> 01:13:29.960
Shrek!

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.633
More heat, less foam!

01:13:35.716 --> 01:13:38.511
# Up where the mountains
Meet the heavens above

01:13:38.552 --> 01:13:41.556
# Out where the lightning
Splits the sea

01:13:41.597 --> 01:13:46.436
# I could swear there is someone
Somewhere watching me

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:49.188
Heave! Ho!

01:13:55.028 --> 01:13:57.863
No...!

01:14:27.269 --> 01:14:28.853
Come on!

01:14:30.104 --> 01:14:31.230
Look out!

01:14:31.313 --> 01:14:35.025
Be good.

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:38.863
He needs me!
Let me go!

01:14:42.285 --> 01:14:43.911
Donkey!

01:14:53.170 --> 01:14:54.629
Puss!

01:14:57.632 --> 01:15:00.135
Go! Go! Your lady needs you! Go!

01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:05.390
Today, l repay my debt.

01:15:10.854 --> 01:15:12.982
Aww...

01:15:13.649 --> 01:15:15.943
On guard!

01:15:19.237 --> 01:15:22.281
# He's gotta be strong
And he's gotta be fast

01:15:22.406 --> 01:15:25.911
# And he's gotta be fresh
From the fight

01:15:25.994 --> 01:15:28.870
- # I need a hero #
- Stop!

01:15:33.336 --> 01:15:37.964
- Hey, you! Back away from my wife.
- Shrek?

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:43.427
You couldn't just go back to your swamp
and leave well enough alone.

01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:45.763
- Now!
- Pigs und blanket!

01:15:48.516 --> 01:15:50.059
Pinocchio! Get the wand!

01:15:50.142 --> 01:15:51.895
l see London! l see France!

01:15:51.978 --> 01:15:53.312
Whah!

01:15:55.566 --> 01:15:57.026
l'm a real boy!

01:16:03.156 --> 01:16:05.074
Ah! Ah! Aaahhh!

01:16:06.868 --> 01:16:07.828

01:16:09.121 --> 01:16:10.247
Donkey!

01:16:12.915 --> 01:16:13.915
Oh!

01:16:14.501 --> 01:16:16.002

01:16:16.044 --> 01:16:17.545
Oh!

01:16:19.381 --> 01:16:20.798
- Ha!
- Ah.

01:16:20.883 --> 01:16:22.635
That's mine!

01:16:26.763 --> 01:16:28.350
Pray for mercy, from Puss...

01:16:28.473 --> 01:16:30.058
And Donkey!

01:16:30.141 --> 01:16:33.103
She's taken the potion!
Kiss her now!

01:16:36.439 --> 01:16:37.441
No!

01:16:55.084 --> 01:16:57.127
Hi-ya!

01:16:59.211 --> 01:17:01.589
- Fiona.
- Shrek.

01:17:01.673 --> 01:17:05.677
Harold! You were supposed
to give her the potion!

01:17:05.761 --> 01:17:09.596
Well, l guess l gave her
the wrong tea.

01:17:09.763 --> 01:17:12.101
- Mommy!
- Mommy?

01:17:12.726 --> 01:17:15.480
l told you.

01:17:15.563 --> 01:17:19.774
Ogres don't live happily ever after.

01:17:29.410 --> 01:17:30.409
Woo!

01:17:31.287 --> 01:17:32.244
Ha!

01:17:43.297 --> 01:17:45.300
Oh, Dad!

01:17:49.262 --> 01:17:51.139
- ls he...?
- Yup.

01:17:52.515 --> 01:17:54.309
He croaked.

01:17:56.478 --> 01:17:57.729
Harold?

01:17:57.813 --> 01:17:58.771
Dad?

01:17:59.731 --> 01:18:02.150
l'd hoped you'd never
see me like this.

01:18:02.192 --> 01:18:04.487
- And he gave you a hard time!
- Donkey!

01:18:04.528 --> 01:18:06.782
No, no, he's right.
l'm sorry.

01:18:07.698 --> 01:18:08.782
To both of you.

01:18:08.866 --> 01:18:11.827
l only wanted what
was best for Fiona.

01:18:12.828 --> 01:18:15.080
But l can see now...

01:18:15.164 --> 01:18:16.833
she already has it.

01:18:17.833 --> 01:18:19.961
Shrek, Fiona...

01:18:20.044 --> 01:18:24.964
Will you accept
an old frog's apologies...

01:18:25.006 --> 01:18:27.842
and my blessing?

01:18:27.884 --> 01:18:30.180
Harold?
l'm sorry, Lillian.

01:18:30.264 --> 01:18:33.808
l just wish l could be
the man you deserve.

01:18:35.058 --> 01:18:38.228
You're more that man today
than you ever were...

01:18:38.311 --> 01:18:40.272
warts and all.

01:18:44.234 --> 01:18:46.570
Boss! The Happily Ever After Potion!

01:18:46.653 --> 01:18:47.779
Midnight!

01:18:48.529 --> 01:18:51.490
Fiona. ls this what you want?

01:18:52.491 --> 01:18:54.536
To be this way forever?

01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:58.332
- What?
- Because if you kiss me now...

01:18:58.374 --> 01:19:00.083
we can stay like this.

01:19:01.043 --> 01:19:03.129
You'd do that?

01:19:03.213 --> 01:19:05.171
- For me?
- Yes.

01:19:13.972 --> 01:19:16.808
l want what any princess wants.

01:19:16.892 --> 01:19:19.562
To live happily ever after...

01:19:23.691 --> 01:19:26.361
with the ogre l married.

01:19:29.404 --> 01:19:32.407
Whatever happens,
l must not cry!

01:19:32.491 --> 01:19:34.576
You cannot make me cry!

01:19:56.723 --> 01:19:58.100
Whoa!

01:19:59.644 --> 01:20:03.021
No. No, no.
Aaah! Ow.

01:20:06.274 --> 01:20:07.985
Oh, no.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.881
Hey. You still look like
a noble steed to me.

01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:35.720
Now, where were we?

01:20:35.804 --> 01:20:38.141
Oh. l remember.

01:20:45.190 --> 01:20:49.276
Hey! lsn't we supposed
to be having a fiesta?

01:20:49.318 --> 01:20:50.944
Uno, dos, quatro, hit it!

01:20:58.203 --> 01:20:59.702
Puss and Donkey, y'all...

01:20:59.786 --> 01:21:02.540
# She's into superstitions

01:21:02.623 --> 01:21:05.250
# Black cats and voodoo dolls

01:21:05.335 --> 01:21:08.004
- Sing it, Puss!
- # I feel a premonition

01:21:08.045 --> 01:21:10.507
# That girl's gonna make me fall

01:21:12.091 --> 01:21:13.134
Here we go!

01:21:13.176 --> 01:21:16.012
# She's into new sensations

01:21:16.053 --> 01:21:18.514
# New kicks in the candlelight

01:21:18.556 --> 01:21:21.225
# She's got a new addiction

01:21:21.309 --> 01:21:23.769
# For every day and night

01:21:23.853 --> 01:21:26.063
# She'll make you take your clothes off

01:21:26.146 --> 01:21:29.317
# And go dancing in the rain

01:21:29.359 --> 01:21:31.444
# She'll make you live her crazy life

01:21:31.528 --> 01:21:33.989
# But she'll take away your pain

01:21:34.073 --> 01:21:37.576
# Like a bullet to your brain

01:21:37.659 --> 01:21:40.119
# Upside inside out

01:21:40.202 --> 01:21:42.497

01:21:50.754 --> 01:21:53.132
# And her skin's the color of mocha

01:21:53.215 --> 01:21:56.136
# She will wear you out

01:21:56.219 --> 01:21:58.887

# She'll push and pull you down

01:22:15.112 --> 01:22:17.698
# Living la vida loca

# Don't wanna be

01:24:11.689 --> 01:24:16.317
# All by myself anymore... #

01:24:16.359 --> 01:24:18.946

Are you serious?
