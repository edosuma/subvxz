Julie?

09:44.947 --> 09:46.281
(RATTLING)

09:48.367 --> 09:50.410
(MUSIC PLAYING)

09:59.295 --> 10:01.588
TEDDY: I like this song!

10:03.758 --> 10:04.966
Not bad.

10:06.886 --> 10:08.303
Mmm, that's pretty good.

10:08.387 --> 10:12.057
Teddy? Did you fall down?

10:16.479 --> 10:18.104
(MUSIC STOPS)

10:26.197 --> 10:27.697
(CREAKING)

10:32.912 --> 10:34.788
DENNIS: What was that?

11:08.655 --> 11:09.989
(GASPS) Oh.

11:10.073 --> 11:11.281
(DENNIS PANTING)

11:11.366 --> 11:13.450
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:13.535 --> 11:15.285
What you doing?

11:15.370 --> 11:16.787
Nothing. I was just looking around.

11:16.871 --> 11:18.789
What... What...
You guys just get home?

11:18.873 --> 11:19.957
- Yeah.
- Oh.

11:20.041 --> 11:22.459
- It was girls' day.
- I know. How was it?

11:22.544 --> 11:24.420
- Was it fun?
- Great.

11:24.504 --> 11:27.089
(CHUCKLES) You just really snuck up
on me there.

11:27.173 --> 11:28.632
(CHUCKLES)

11:29.342 --> 11:31.552
DENNIS: All right. It's time.

11:31.636 --> 11:33.554
- Don't film this.
- Why not?

11:34.723 --> 11:36.015
It's illegal.

11:36.099 --> 11:37.599
- (DENNIS LAUGHS)
- Don't laugh.

11:37.684 --> 11:40.477
We haven't even started smoking it,
and you're already paranoid.

11:40.562 --> 11:42.396
It's illegal.
What if my kids find me? I'm a mother.

11:42.522 --> 11:44.314
- Now relax.
- Seriously, Dennis.

11:44.399 --> 11:45.482
Seriously, Julie.

11:45.567 --> 11:47.901
(MOCKING) Let's get really serious.
Seriously.

11:47.986 --> 11:48.986
- Shut up.
- Let's be serious.

11:49.070 --> 11:51.947
- All right.
- Real, real, real big, big...

11:52.073 --> 11:53.949
Whoa. That was big.

11:54.034 --> 11:55.534
(COUGHING)

11:55.618 --> 11:57.619
Julie, do the voice.

11:57.746 --> 11:59.747
(IN FUNNY VOICE) Dennis.

12:00.874 --> 12:03.042
- (IN FUNNY VOICE) What voice?
- (DENNIS LAUGHS)

12:03.126 --> 12:04.835
This voice?

12:04.919 --> 12:11.300
Dennis, I can't believe
you're filming me smoke marijuana.

12:11.384 --> 12:13.177
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

12:17.098 --> 12:18.432
DENNIS: (WHISPERING)
God, you're so beautiful.

12:18.558 --> 12:19.767
Shut up.

12:21.770 --> 12:24.605
I want to film us having sex.

12:28.068 --> 12:29.735
Is that perverted?

12:31.279 --> 12:33.280
- Is that weird?
- I don't know.

12:35.450 --> 12:36.992
Was that a yes?

12:38.953 --> 12:40.079
Okay.

12:40.955 --> 12:42.956
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:49.631 --> 12:51.548
- Hey, there, pretty lady.
- (CHUCKLES)

12:51.633 --> 12:54.718
Oh, stop. I don't know.

12:54.803 --> 12:57.805
You sure... You sure you're up for this?

12:57.931 --> 12:58.972
No.

12:59.099 --> 13:00.349
You know what? Don't answer that.

13:00.475 --> 13:02.851
Hurry up, before I change my mind.

13:03.436 --> 13:04.978
Oh, okay, sorry.

13:06.856 --> 13:08.941
- (CHUCKLES)
- All right.

13:12.112 --> 13:13.987
(IMITATES GUITAR)

13:15.156 --> 13:17.533
What are you doing? What was that?

13:17.659 --> 13:19.618
- It's porno music.
- (LAUGHS)

13:20.286 --> 13:21.787
Great. Classy.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.584
Mmm. Good start.

13:27.669 --> 13:29.336
Good, right?

13:31.214 --> 13:33.340
- All right.
- I don't know.

13:42.892 --> 13:45.018
Mmm. (GROANING LUSTFULLY)

13:48.148 --> 13:49.690
(CLATTERING IN DISTANCE)

13:56.906 --> 13:57.948
(CLATTERING CONTINUES)

13:58.032 --> 14:00.450
Relax. Just relax.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.369
Don't worry about it.

14:05.582 --> 14:08.584
Hey.

14:08.710 --> 14:10.544
- Yeah. I'm okay.
- Relax.

14:26.769 --> 14:28.103
(THUDDING)

14:29.397 --> 14:30.856
- Yeah, what is that?
- I don't know.

14:43.411 --> 14:44.661
Whoa!

14:44.746 --> 14:46.079
(RUMBLING)

14:46.581 --> 14:47.789
It's an earthquake.

14:47.916 --> 14:50.542
- Holy shit!
- Dennis, it's an earthquake!

14:51.586 --> 14:53.795
The girls. The girls!

14:53.922 --> 14:55.964
Come on! Dennis!

15:07.518 --> 15:09.269
(RUMBLING SUBSIDES)

15:25.995 --> 15:29.206
JULIE: Dennis. Oh, my God, I look so fat.

15:29.290 --> 15:30.374
DENNIS: You don't look fat.

15:30.458 --> 15:32.167
- Look at the size of me on top of you.
- You look beautiful.

15:32.293 --> 15:34.294
You look like you can't breathe
'cause I'm sitting on top of you.

15:34.420 --> 15:35.796
I want another shot
at doing one of these.

15:35.922 --> 15:37.214
- Watch this.
- Dennis, you have to erase this.

15:37.298 --> 15:38.715
Julie, watch, watch, watch.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.467
- See that?
- What?

15:40.635 --> 15:42.052
Did you see that in the corner?

15:42.136 --> 15:44.763
Yeah, I see, like, dust.

15:45.473 --> 15:46.723
- Dirt falling.
- No, Julie.

15:46.808 --> 15:47.933
There's something there.

15:48.017 --> 15:49.851
- You are crazy.
- There was something there.

15:49.978 --> 15:50.978
Wait, you can see something there.

15:51.104 --> 15:52.145
It's very cute,
but you're going a little crazy.

15:52.272 --> 15:55.357
You're like one of those people
that see things, like in their food.

15:55.483 --> 15:57.401
Like when people think
they see the Virgin Mary in their toast.

15:57.485 --> 15:58.568
- That's you right now.
- Oh, that's hilarious.

15:58.653 --> 16:00.862
This has to be erased
and this has to be erased.

16:00.989 --> 16:03.115
I'm sorry.
Or we're never having sex again.

16:03.199 --> 16:06.076
I'm late. I got to go.
Thanks for erasing both of them.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.787
You know,
you're going to regret saying that.

16:08.871 --> 16:09.913
Doubt it.

16:09.998 --> 16:12.124
I don't think you can go a day
without having sex, personally.

16:12.208 --> 16:13.583
(IN SING-SONG) Don't dare me.

16:13.668 --> 16:16.169
- Erase it.
- I'm not going to erase it.

16:17.338 --> 16:19.256
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.

16:19.340 --> 16:21.800
Dude, what are you doing, man?
You're always so late.

16:21.884 --> 16:23.343
I know, it's my car!

16:23.469 --> 16:24.720
I got the earthquake.

16:24.846 --> 16:26.638
- Did you really?
- On tape.

16:26.723 --> 16:27.889
It's scary, right? Is that Julie?

16:28.016 --> 16:29.057
It's nothing, it's nothing.

16:29.183 --> 16:30.559
- We're going to...
- Is that a sex tape?

16:30.685 --> 16:32.894
Yeah. I got...
This weird thing happened after...

16:33.021 --> 16:34.062
She let you make a sex tape?

16:34.188 --> 16:36.106
Yeah, but it got interrupted
by the earthquake.

16:36.190 --> 16:37.774
I wouldn't have let
anything interrupt that.

16:37.859 --> 16:39.985
Relax, man, just relax.
Would you just stop?

16:40.069 --> 16:42.112
- Let me slow-mo shuttle forward.
- Just shut up.

16:42.196 --> 16:43.488
DENNIS: Check this out. Ready?

16:43.573 --> 16:45.282
All right, let me tweak the contrast here.

16:45.366 --> 16:46.408
Okay.

16:46.534 --> 16:47.534
I'm gonna take the color out.

16:47.660 --> 16:50.412
It looks like dust is falling on something.

16:51.039 --> 16:52.205
It looks like a figure, right?

16:52.332 --> 16:53.498
- You see that?
- Yeah.

16:53.583 --> 16:55.250
Did you catch that?

16:55.376 --> 16:56.626
- Yeah, it moved.
- Did you see the dust move?

16:56.711 --> 16:58.128
- It moved, right?
- What was that?

16:58.212 --> 16:59.796
I don't know. Check it out.

16:59.881 --> 17:01.340
- It's weird, right?
- It's kind of weird.

17:01.424 --> 17:04.050
You know, I've been hearing
these noises in the girls' room lately.

17:04.176 --> 17:06.470
I don't know. I feel like it's...

17:06.554 --> 17:07.929
Something weird's going on.

17:08.056 --> 17:10.265
- DENNIS: Julie?
- Yeah, I'm back here.

17:12.226 --> 17:14.644
Hey, um, I wanted to talk to you...

17:14.729 --> 17:15.771
(SHRIEKS) Dennis!

17:15.896 --> 17:16.896
Oh, sorry! Sorry.

17:17.065 --> 17:18.065
Oh, my God!

17:18.191 --> 17:19.191
(LAUGHS) Sorry.

17:19.275 --> 17:21.233
You mind if I set up
a couple cameras around the house?

17:21.361 --> 17:23.153
I'm not going to talk to you right now.

17:23.237 --> 17:25.238
Okay, I'll... I'll take that as a yes?

17:25.365 --> 17:28.075
- I hate you!
- Okay. Love you, too.

17:30.078 --> 17:31.661
KATIE: How long do the tapes last?

17:31.746 --> 17:32.996
DENNIS: About six hours each.

17:33.081 --> 17:35.123
So you have to change
them every six hours?

17:35.249 --> 17:36.458
Mmm, yes.

17:38.086 --> 17:39.669
Katie, can you hop out of the frame?

17:39.754 --> 17:41.880
- Okay. Is that good?
- Yeah, so I can...

17:41.964 --> 17:43.590
Keep going.

17:43.716 --> 17:45.967
- KATIE: Can I see it?
- Sure.

17:46.094 --> 17:48.178
Here. Come here. See it?

17:48.262 --> 17:49.346
Yeah.

17:49.430 --> 17:51.348
- Pretty cool, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

17:51.432 --> 17:53.266
So, what are you trying to see?

17:53.393 --> 17:55.185
Uh, anything unusual or strange.

17:55.269 --> 17:57.187
Oh, no, it's not that.
Don't touch the camera.

17:57.271 --> 17:58.855
- Kristi?
- Yeah?

17:58.940 --> 18:00.524
Don't touch the camera or anything.

18:00.608 --> 18:02.109
Katie, just leave it alone.

18:02.693 --> 18:04.111
(CLATTERING)

18:08.783 --> 18:10.200
- Dennis.
- What?

18:10.284 --> 18:11.451
Really?

18:13.162 --> 18:14.704
Don't you think
you're overreacting a little?

18:14.789 --> 18:15.997
This is a new house.

18:16.124 --> 18:18.166
It shouldn't be making these noises.

18:18.292 --> 18:21.294
Not just in here.
It's in the girls' room, too.

18:23.798 --> 18:24.840
No...

18:26.634 --> 18:28.427
This is not gonna work here.

18:28.511 --> 18:30.887
Like, what do you think
you're gonna catch?

18:30.972 --> 18:32.973
Whatever's in our house.

18:34.183 --> 18:37.602
Oh, right, 'cause there's
something here watching us.

18:40.273 --> 18:42.149
Well, there's definitely something.

18:42.275 --> 18:46.403
I... I feel it.
I feel something, I'm telling you.

18:46.487 --> 18:48.071
JULIE: Yeah, I feel something, too.
I'm not gonna lie.

18:48.156 --> 18:49.239
I feel a camera.

18:49.323 --> 18:52.951
The earthquake, and all those...

18:53.035 --> 18:55.203
I don't know,
stuff that's been happening and...

18:55.329 --> 18:57.164
I don't know, I just...

18:57.665 --> 18:59.541
No, it's totally normal.

19:00.668 --> 19:01.877
(SIGHS)

19:04.005 --> 19:05.380
Bye, camera.

19:07.884 --> 19:09.426
Good night, camera.

19:09.510 --> 19:10.760
(KISSES)

19:33.367 --> 19:34.659
(CREAKING)

19:34.744 --> 19:36.495
(PATTERING)

20:12.198 --> 20:13.365
Yeah?

20:15.910 --> 20:17.410
Yeah, probably.

20:19.413 --> 20:20.497
In their bedroom.

20:20.581 --> 20:23.250
Be quiet, so we don't wake Katie up.

20:24.710 --> 20:26.586
(WHISPERING) It's okay.

20:29.757 --> 20:30.882
Why?

20:34.929 --> 20:35.929
Oh.

20:36.055 --> 20:37.931
Yeah, kind of.

20:38.057 --> 20:39.766
He's very sweet.

20:54.740 --> 20:56.741
Yeah, I saw that.

20:57.076 --> 20:58.952
I watched some of the tapes
on the camera

20:59.078 --> 21:02.330
and I saw you
talking to somebody late last night.

21:02.456 --> 21:06.084
If you saw me talking to somebody,
it would be Toby.

21:06.168 --> 21:08.920
(CHUCKLES) Toby's your friend?

21:09.005 --> 21:10.589
Yes. He's my friend.

21:10.673 --> 21:12.799
Yeah, what do you guys talk about?

21:12.925 --> 21:14.050
Mmm, secrets.

21:14.135 --> 21:16.469
- He's big?
- Mmm-hmm.

21:16.596 --> 21:18.471
So, is he old, like Grandma,

21:18.598 --> 21:20.515
or is he young, like you?

21:21.809 --> 21:24.144
He's old, like Grandma.

21:24.979 --> 21:26.229
And what does he look like?

21:26.314 --> 21:28.982
Is he tall? Is he fat?

21:29.108 --> 21:30.859
He's tall. He's tall.

21:32.653 --> 21:33.862
Don't call him fat.

21:33.988 --> 21:37.073
Kristi, when you say that
if you tell one of your secrets

21:37.158 --> 21:40.285
that you'll be in trouble with Toby,
what does that mean?

21:40.369 --> 21:42.787
Well, I won't be safe.

21:44.832 --> 21:46.916
He's gonna...
Did he say he's gonna hurt you?

21:47.001 --> 21:48.043
No.

21:49.170 --> 21:51.087
But I won't be safe.

21:51.172 --> 21:53.465
That means, I will be, like...

21:54.175 --> 21:57.177
Be in very, very big trouble.

21:57.845 --> 21:59.429
Big trouble.

21:59.513 --> 22:00.680
DENNIS: You saw her.
JULIE: That's how it is.

22:00.806 --> 22:02.182
It was like he was actually there, right?

22:02.308 --> 22:03.308
I know.

22:03.392 --> 22:05.810
Because that's how active
kids' imaginations are.

22:05.895 --> 22:06.936
It's crazy.

22:07.021 --> 22:08.271
I mean, imagination is one thing.

22:08.356 --> 22:09.981
She got up in the middle of the night.

22:10.066 --> 22:12.525
I mean, it's a little odd
that she got up in the middle...

22:12.652 --> 22:15.111
You haven't been around kids
for that long. They do weird things.

22:15.196 --> 22:17.864
They... Katie used to get up
in the middle of the night

22:17.990 --> 22:19.574
and she used to sleep on the toilet.

22:19.700 --> 22:20.867
(LAUGHING) What?

22:20.993 --> 22:22.118
Okay? I'm serious.

22:22.203 --> 22:23.244
Really?

22:23.371 --> 22:26.956
Yes. Toby is a phase and he's going to
be gone in a couple weeks.

22:27.041 --> 22:28.083
I know it.

22:28.209 --> 22:29.793
RANDY: How many hours of footage
do you have?

22:29.877 --> 22:32.921
This is the job, man. I got two cameras,

22:33.047 --> 22:35.382
six hours each. Twelve hours.

22:35.466 --> 22:37.884
- Twelve hours of footage?
- Yeah. Got to do it, man.

22:37.968 --> 22:40.011
- I'm seriously gonna review it.
- ...of footage every day.

22:40.096 --> 22:42.138
Yes. Now, please,
I'm trying to concentrate.

22:42.223 --> 22:45.141
That's so stupid.
There's only 24 hours in a day, Dennis.

- ...going?

22:46.811 --> 22:47.977
DENNIS: Um... Good.

22:48.062 --> 22:51.314
You want to step into my office
and do some work with me or...

22:51.399 --> 22:53.400
No. You find anything?

22:53.484 --> 22:56.611
RANDY: Yes, actually.
We did find something.

22:56.737 --> 23:00.490
We found that
your family sleeps all night. Oh!

23:00.574 --> 23:01.658
Very funny, Randy.

23:01.742 --> 23:03.076
- Keep up the good work.

She would go nuts, and, you know,

she'd make me take
the cameras down, and I can't do that.
