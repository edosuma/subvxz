I got the sharp cheddar
and I mixed it with Gouda,

08:29.607 --> 08:32.107
'cause I know Gouda gives
a nice, smoky flavor.

08:32.143 --> 08:33.842
It's inspired by Tex-Mex.

08:33.878 --> 08:36.846
A lot of Mexican foods
are spicy and smoky.

Wow, visually, it's beautiful.
It's rustic, it's charming.

10:40.035 --> 10:42.346
That looks like it's just come
out of an Italian restaurant.

10:42.370 --> 10:44.270
I have a lot of Italian
in my blood.

10:44.306 --> 10:46.873

Why pesto over the ravioli?

10:51.747 --> 10:54.881
Right, how did you combine
the cheese in the center?

10:54.916 --> 10:58.451
I used an immersion blender

<i>Graham says he has
an even bigger fish.</i>

17:38.683 --> 17:42.051

than these huge fish?

17:42.087 --> 17:44.520
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

17:44.556 --> 17:47.056
Is Graham, like, gonna come back

17:47.092 --> 17:48.758
<i>with a giant dragon fish?</i>

17:48.793 --> 17:50.927
Oh, no, I'm scared!

17:50.962 --> 17:52.662
- Eww.
- Oh, my God!

17:52.697 --> 17:54.731

That's a fish!

17:54.766 --> 17:58.301

17:58.336 --> 18:01.571
That is what I call a real fish.

18:01.606 --> 18:03.239

- Oh, my God!

18:03.274 --> 18:04.507
Is that a piranha?

18:04.542 --> 18:07.076
Now, this is a moonfish.

18:07.112 --> 18:08.511
That looks like Jaws!

18:08.546 --> 18:11.514
Weighs about 115 pounds.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.449

Whoa.

filet this thing?

<i>I'm really happy that Graham,</i>

<i>my favorite chef in the world,</i>

18:24.529 --> 18:27.096
<i>is gonna show us
how to filet a fish.</i>

18:27.132 --> 18:28.931
This is, like,
the best day ever.

18:28.967 --> 18:31.934
This guy's got a giant
bone plate here

18:31.970 --> 18:33.269
to control his organs,

18:33.304 --> 18:35.438
so I'm gonna cut just like this.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.543
Once you're through that part,

18:40.578 --> 18:42.111
take it up here at the top.

18:42.147 --> 18:44.614
Get as close to the bone
as you can.

18:44.649 --> 18:46.249
Go over that spine.

18:46.284 --> 18:49.385
That's gonna try to leave
as much meat as possible

18:49.421 --> 18:50.853
for us to take off.

18:50.889 --> 18:53.289
Let the knife do the work.

18:53.324 --> 18:56.926
Pull up gently
so as not to tear the filet.

18:56.961 --> 18:59.629
Even though you guys
are not gonna be filleting

18:59.664 --> 19:00.963
a fish this big,

19:00.999 --> 19:02.732
this is pretty much
the exact same technique

19:02.767 --> 19:05.468
you're gonna do with other fish.

19:05.503 --> 19:08.604
Next we're gonna split
this loin into two,

19:08.640 --> 19:11.674
following the seam of the filet.

19:11.709 --> 19:13.342
Get your knife at an angle.

19:13.378 --> 19:16.446
This is taking off the skin.
Now cut through.

19:16.481 --> 19:17.713
Pull your fingers back.

19:17.749 --> 19:19.081
- See?
- Beautiful.

19:19.117 --> 19:20.483
There's a filet.
There we go.

19:20.518 --> 19:22.485
You're looking at close
to 120 portions

19:22.520 --> 19:24.620
out of this giant fish.

19:24.656 --> 19:27.156
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Big old fishy!

19:27.192 --> 19:28.524
Great?
Exciting?

19:28.560 --> 19:30.092
- Yes, Chef!
- Thank you, guys.

19:30.128 --> 19:31.260
Let's do it.

19:31.296 --> 19:34.964
Watching Graham
filet that fish so precise,

19:34.999 --> 19:36.933
<i>that was one of
my favorite lessons.</i>

19:36.968 --> 19:38.668
Maybe even more
than science class.

19:38.703 --> 19:41.604

the mystery box challenge,

rivers to lakes to oceans.

23:28.900 --> 23:30.077
Tonight there's added pressure

23:30.101 --> 23:31.345

They've got a whole fish.

Okay, I removed the head.

We know these kids are good
enough to filet their own fish.

It's how they butcher them,
how they break them down,

then there's a way

23:46.017 --> 23:47.094

scoring it,
