WEBVTT

00:04.717 --> 00:07.853
Okay, what nationality
was "Chop-in"?

00:07.887 --> 00:09.255
Chopin. Who the hell is that?

00:09.289 --> 00:10.323
Piano guy.

00:10.356 --> 00:12.192
Ew. Just guess a country.

00:12.225 --> 00:13.426
Whatever.

00:13.459 --> 00:14.560
Delaware.

00:14.594 --> 00:15.695
Delaware's a state.

00:15.728 --> 00:17.497
State, country.

00:17.530 --> 00:18.364
Ooh!

00:18.398 --> 00:19.232
Europe.

00:19.265 --> 00:20.366
"Pol-ish."

00:20.400 --> 00:21.667
What's "pol-ish"?

00:21.701 --> 00:22.735
Polish.

00:22.768 --> 00:24.237
It's where Poles are from.

00:24.270 --> 00:25.538
You'd love it there, Lindsers.

00:26.739 --> 00:29.041
Sport and leisure.

00:29.075 --> 00:30.843
What's the first letter
on the typewriter?

00:30.876 --> 00:31.711
"A."

00:31.744 --> 00:33.546
Wrong. "Q." "Q"?

00:33.579 --> 00:34.547
"Q"? "Q"?

00:34.580 --> 00:35.548
Why "Q"?

00:35.581 --> 00:36.516
It just says "Q."

00:36.549 --> 00:37.717
Why would "Q" be first?

00:37.750 --> 00:39.552
Barely any words use Qs.

00:39.585 --> 00:42.054
Qs are like
the elbows of letters.

00:42.088 --> 00:43.423
What does that mean?

00:43.456 --> 00:44.890
You're so funny.

00:44.924 --> 00:45.958
It should totally be "A."

00:45.991 --> 00:47.026
Yeah!

00:47.059 --> 00:48.027
I should get a pie.

00:48.060 --> 00:49.061
I want a pie!

00:49.095 --> 00:50.230
Here.

00:50.263 --> 00:52.232
Oh.

00:52.265 --> 00:53.742
You thought we meant real pie,
didn't you?

00:53.766 --> 00:56.068
You want a pie?
I can make you a pie.

00:56.102 --> 00:57.570
Oh, Edgar.

00:57.603 --> 01:00.373
You don't have to make me
a coconut cream pie.

01:00.406 --> 01:01.817
Then you'd have to go
to the store for me

01:01.841 --> 01:05.111
and also buy me ice cream
and tampons while you're there.

01:06.779 --> 01:09.382
I am learning so much
from this game.

01:09.415 --> 01:11.251
That the National
Air and Space Museum

01:11.284 --> 01:13.319
isn't named after some guy
named Aaron Space?

01:13.353 --> 01:14.420
No.

01:14.454 --> 01:16.922
That Edgar will
do things for me.

01:16.956 --> 01:18.057
Ever since I owned the mic

01:18.090 --> 01:19.625
at Becca's stupid
surprise baby party,

01:19.659 --> 01:21.294
he's been riding my jock hard.

01:21.327 --> 01:22.262
You did what now?

01:22.295 --> 01:23.729
I sang Kate Bush.

01:23.763 --> 01:25.097
It was crazy.

01:25.131 --> 01:26.766
Just preheating the oven.

01:26.799 --> 01:28.768
You're sweet! My turn.

01:28.801 --> 01:30.503
Oh, my God! Are you not done?

01:30.536 --> 01:32.104
Science and nature.

01:32.138 --> 01:34.607
Who was the first man in space?

01:34.640 --> 01:35.441
Easy.

01:35.475 --> 01:36.776
Hmm.

01:36.809 --> 01:38.444
Let me see.

01:38.478 --> 01:40.780
I know Louis Armstrong.

01:40.813 --> 01:42.782
Buzz Lightyear?

01:42.815 --> 01:45.485
The name Kurt Loder
is coming to mind.

01:45.518 --> 01:46.952
That does sound familiar.

01:46.986 --> 01:48.087
Yuri Gagarin!

01:48.120 --> 01:50.656
It's Yuri Gagarin.

01:50.690 --> 01:53.125
Louis Armstrong
was a jazz trumpeter.

01:53.159 --> 01:55.461
Buzz Lightyear is a cartoon.

01:55.495 --> 01:58.364
And Kurt Loder was a VJ for MTV,

01:58.398 --> 02:01.033
about whom the only
connection to space travel

02:01.066 --> 02:04.204
was that the network's logo
was a man in a space suit.

02:04.237 --> 02:05.438
Yeah.

02:05.471 --> 02:06.472
I don't know, Jimmy.

02:06.506 --> 02:08.973
That doesn't sound right.

02:09.008 --> 02:11.477
Charles Dickens wrote
what 1837 novel

02:11.511 --> 02:13.346
about the plight
of street urchins?

02:13.379 --> 02:14.980
Annie.

02:15.014 --> 02:16.216
Wow. Yes!

02:16.249 --> 02:19.785
Pie for you.

02:39.605 --> 02:41.073
Salinger, Brontë,

02:41.106 --> 02:44.310
Ralph Ellison, Sylvia Plath.

02:44.344 --> 02:48.180
The expectation of a second
novel can paralyze some.

02:48.214 --> 02:49.849
But what is there
to be afraid of?

02:49.882 --> 02:53.018
I received an only positive

02:53.052 --> 02:55.187
adjacent review in The Times.

02:55.221 --> 02:58.157
If you look past
Michiko Kakutani's

02:58.190 --> 03:00.226
thinly veiled ethnocentrism

03:00.260 --> 03:02.027
and scorching ephebiphobia.

03:02.061 --> 03:03.863
But am I afraid?

03:03.896 --> 03:05.030
No!

03:05.064 --> 03:06.899
Writing is fear.

03:06.932 --> 03:09.702
To say that I allowed
fear to cripple me

03:09.735 --> 03:12.405
would be to say that I am not,
in fact, a writer,

03:12.438 --> 03:15.941
which would be akin to saying,
"Lo, condemn me thus

03:15.975 --> 03:19.144
back to the earth,
for I am no more."

03:20.913 --> 03:23.182
Wait, so do you or do you not

03:23.215 --> 03:25.050
have something for me to read?

03:25.084 --> 03:26.352
You're my agent, right?

03:26.386 --> 03:28.120
It's your job to find me work

03:28.153 --> 03:31.090
while things percolate
on the follow-up.

03:31.123 --> 03:33.092
Jimmy, I can't get you
any more magazine work

03:33.125 --> 03:34.894
after Megan Thomas sued you

03:34.927 --> 03:36.372
for writing about
having sex with her.

03:36.396 --> 03:38.931
Chuck Klosterman sent me
a bottle of scotch for that one.

03:38.964 --> 03:40.409
I do get calls for people
needing translation work,

03:40.433 --> 03:43.135
research assistant,
novelization of movies...

03:43.168 --> 03:46.105
there's a popcorn catalog
that needs a copywriter.

03:46.138 --> 03:47.206
Forget it!

03:47.239 --> 03:49.275
Just hearing
those horrific choices

03:49.309 --> 03:51.043
has fueled my fire.

03:51.076 --> 03:53.579
I can tell that the big idea
is right around the corner.

03:53.613 --> 03:55.415
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised

03:55.448 --> 03:58.083
if I start flying through
those pages any day now.

03:58.117 --> 04:01.921
Nope, would not be
surprised at all.

04:01.954 --> 04:04.089
He'll have another.

04:04.123 --> 04:05.425
I'll get the tab.

04:05.458 --> 04:06.759
But this is really stretching

04:06.792 --> 04:08.594
the definition
of the word "meeting," Jimmy.

04:20.606 --> 04:22.107
Jimmy?!

04:22.141 --> 04:23.242
Jimmy!

04:23.275 --> 04:24.310
What?!

04:26.111 --> 04:27.947
Where's the Bloody Mary bar?

04:27.980 --> 04:29.281
What the hell? Edgar!

04:29.315 --> 04:31.083
Edgar! It is Sunday, right?

04:31.116 --> 04:33.753
Edgar! Edgar!

04:33.786 --> 04:35.488
Oh, my God.

04:35.521 --> 04:36.956
I don't think he's home.

04:36.989 --> 04:39.224
It's all right.

04:40.125 --> 04:42.362
We're adults.

04:42.395 --> 04:44.597
We can do this ourselves.

04:44.630 --> 04:46.632
Okay.

04:48.067 --> 04:51.337
Well, I know it involves
vodka and tomato juice.

04:51.371 --> 04:53.138
Well, we have a tomato.

04:53.172 --> 04:55.140
I'm sure that's fine.

04:55.174 --> 04:57.977
Celery.

04:58.010 --> 04:59.979
We have carrots.

05:00.012 --> 05:02.181
Same thing, basically.

05:02.214 --> 05:03.616
Mayonnaise?

05:03.649 --> 05:05.184
Yeah.

05:11.256 --> 05:13.626
Don't you think it's time
you got your own stuff?

05:13.659 --> 05:15.495
I mean, you're wearing
my clothes,

05:15.528 --> 05:16.996
using my toothbrush...

05:17.029 --> 05:18.564
So?

05:18.598 --> 05:21.333
Listen, I'm perfectly fine
having you as a girlfriend.

05:21.367 --> 05:22.668
Aw.

05:22.702 --> 05:24.003
But not as a dependent.

05:24.036 --> 05:25.838
I'll get stuff.

05:25.871 --> 05:27.039
But where in your mind's eye

05:27.072 --> 05:28.674
do you see me putting said stuff

05:28.708 --> 05:29.875
once I get it?

05:29.909 --> 05:32.011
You know, where you keep things.

05:32.044 --> 05:34.346
You mean, the three trash bags
on the floor in the corner?

05:34.380 --> 05:36.215
Uh-huh, Gretchen's corner.

05:37.182 --> 05:38.384
Fine. Look.

05:38.418 --> 05:40.486
If there's space
that I'm not using

05:40.520 --> 05:43.355
that can't be, you know, seen,

05:43.389 --> 05:44.490
it's yours. See?

05:44.524 --> 05:46.034
There's no room for me
in my own house!

05:46.058 --> 05:47.527
Sorry, your house?

05:47.560 --> 05:48.861
Fine... our house.

05:48.894 --> 05:50.195
Um...

05:50.229 --> 05:52.064
When I was a kid,
I'd say come over

05:52.097 --> 05:53.866
and watch Skin-amax
and drink Zima

05:53.899 --> 05:55.401
in "my house" or "our house,"

05:55.435 --> 05:57.336
not "the house my
parents bought."

05:57.369 --> 06:00.005
Well, they should've
corrected you on that.

06:04.877 --> 06:06.211
Mmm.

06:07.212 --> 06:09.515
Hey, guys!

06:09.549 --> 06:11.893
You have one job on Sundays, one!
What were you thinking not being here?

06:11.917 --> 06:14.687
My fault... I made him take me
to get football costumes.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.922
Yeah, everything's
in the Bloody Mary drawer.

06:16.956 --> 06:18.524
I'll show you.

06:18.558 --> 06:20.125
It's super easy...

06:20.159 --> 06:21.293
What's going on?

06:21.326 --> 06:23.228
You've never watched
a sport in your life.

06:23.262 --> 06:24.897
Gretch, I need to get over Paul.

06:24.930 --> 06:26.231
And apparently, on Sundays,

06:26.265 --> 06:27.633
they have these sports bars

06:27.667 --> 06:29.134
full of horny macho dum-dums

06:29.168 --> 06:30.412
whose girlfriends
are all at home.

06:30.436 --> 06:31.437
Plus wings.

06:31.471 --> 06:32.705
You do love wings.

06:32.738 --> 06:33.906
I need a bo-hunk.

06:33.939 --> 06:35.374
Paul was such a gump.

06:35.407 --> 06:37.743
Get this... he told me
the definition of love

06:37.777 --> 06:39.879
is putting someone else's needs
above yours.

06:39.912 --> 06:41.246
Ew. I know.

06:41.280 --> 06:44.083
Meanwhile,
Edgar's being so nice.

06:44.116 --> 06:47.119
He knows I'm hurting
so he keeps doing stuff for me.

06:47.152 --> 06:48.954
Just be careful with him, okay?

06:48.988 --> 06:51.591
Edgar, let's hit the wing place
before the game starts.

06:51.624 --> 06:52.625
Yeah.

06:52.658 --> 06:53.926
We'll ride with you.

06:53.959 --> 06:55.661
There's a Towels &
Stuff in that mall

06:55.695 --> 06:57.797
where Gretchen can
buy a toothbrush

06:57.830 --> 06:59.932
and other things adults own.

06:59.965 --> 07:00.933
You're gonna help me shop?

07:00.966 --> 07:01.967
Hell, no.

07:02.001 --> 07:03.469
I'm going for
literary inspiration.

07:03.503 --> 07:05.280
I'm not finding it here,
so maybe I'll find it

07:05.304 --> 07:08.240
amongst the diabetic masses
of the American shopper.

07:08.273 --> 07:10.309
I'm like Thoreau,

07:10.342 --> 07:13.078
only the mall
shall be my Walden.

07:13.112 --> 07:14.814
Mall-den.

07:17.817 --> 07:21.487
I would've found that
eventually.

07:27.827 --> 07:29.161
Mmm!

07:29.194 --> 07:31.196
This way!

07:33.398 --> 07:35.134
Wait!

07:35.167 --> 07:38.337
Hang out with me first.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.806
What do you want to do?

08:17.910 --> 08:19.545
That's your boyfriend.

08:20.713 --> 08:22.682
That's your girlfriend.

08:24.349 --> 08:26.919
That's your boyfriend.

08:28.353 --> 08:30.155
Yes, he is. Mm-hmm.

08:30.189 --> 08:31.390
I love my boyfriend.

08:31.423 --> 08:32.892
Do you really?

08:44.403 --> 08:46.906
This is shit! Derivative trifle!

08:46.939 --> 08:48.407
The composition is wretched.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.175
Tonal harmony nonexistent.

08:50.209 --> 08:52.111
Don't even get me started
on the perspective.

08:52.144 --> 08:53.579
Blue ribbon?

08:53.613 --> 08:55.380
This contest is a sham.

09:01.787 --> 09:03.889
Oh, what next? What next?

09:03.923 --> 09:05.925
Go buy your crap.
I have to work now.

09:05.958 --> 09:07.927
No whining, woman!

09:12.598 --> 09:15.034
Let the observation...

09:15.067 --> 09:18.403
begin.

09:18.437 --> 09:21.774
And they have four chances
to get said ten yards.

09:21.807 --> 09:24.543
Now, before I get into some of
your various offensive packages,

09:24.576 --> 09:27.112
I'm reminded of when
my older brother Salazar

09:27.146 --> 09:28.614
took me to see a Raider game.

09:28.648 --> 09:32.151
We were so far away, but to me,
it was like being on the field.

09:32.184 --> 09:35.387
And then he sold crank to a
Chargers fan in the men's room

09:35.420 --> 09:38.290
and we used the money
to go to Applebee's.

09:38.323 --> 09:41.060
You know what I think?

09:41.093 --> 09:42.962
I think...

09:42.995 --> 09:44.964
that's my guy.

09:44.997 --> 09:46.131
At the bar.

09:46.165 --> 09:47.933
Over there, with the shoulders.

09:47.967 --> 09:49.735
All right, go to it.

09:49.769 --> 09:50.936
Go to what?

09:50.970 --> 09:52.337
Go wing man for me.

09:52.371 --> 09:54.306
Oh, okay.

09:54.339 --> 09:57.009
How many wings should this man

09:57.042 --> 09:59.311
go get you? No.

09:59.344 --> 10:00.846
Go talk to that cute guy for me.

10:04.483 --> 10:06.652
Oh, but now that you mention it,

10:06.686 --> 10:09.621
I could use
some more wings, too.

10:17.562 --> 10:19.699
Okay, here I go.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.035
Nope.

10:25.137 --> 10:26.471
Nope.

10:28.007 --> 10:29.975
Nuh-uh.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.478
Can I help you find something?

10:33.512 --> 10:35.848
Puppies?

10:35.881 --> 10:37.883
Do you have any puppies?

10:37.917 --> 10:39.651
Oh, wait...

10:39.685 --> 10:41.987
this isn't a dog store.

10:45.190 --> 10:47.659
Daisy and Mort met
in Buenos Aires

10:47.693 --> 10:49.394
in 1968.

10:49.428 --> 10:51.130
Daisy worked at a hat factory.

10:51.163 --> 10:54.366
Mort lived as an Ashkenazi Jew,
but really

10:54.399 --> 10:57.236
he was a Nazi war criminal.

10:57.269 --> 10:58.804
No, that's dumb.

10:58.838 --> 11:00.840
Who cares?

11:03.342 --> 11:06.712
Megan was just like
any other 15-year-old girl.

11:06.746 --> 11:08.513
She loved social media,

11:08.547 --> 11:09.882
hated her parents,

11:09.915 --> 11:13.152
and lived and died by the
fluctuating attention from boys.

11:13.185 --> 11:14.653
But what most people didn't know

11:14.686 --> 11:17.156
was that Megan was actually...

11:17.189 --> 11:19.892
a Nazi war criminal.

11:19.925 --> 11:22.061
Aah! What's wrong with me?

11:22.094 --> 11:23.395
Excuse me?

11:23.428 --> 11:25.197
Yeah? Uh, your job must be

11:25.230 --> 11:26.565
tedious and bleak.

11:26.598 --> 11:27.833
Tell me about it.

11:27.867 --> 11:30.836
Ah, sure. Well, so far
it's a sweet-ass gig.

11:30.870 --> 11:33.238
I walk around
macking on hos all day.

11:33.272 --> 11:35.407
And nobody in the food court
busses their trays,

11:35.440 --> 11:36.842
so I eat like a king.

11:36.876 --> 11:39.879
And if I don't want to chase
a shoplifter, I don't.

11:39.912 --> 11:42.081
I go smoke a bowl
out on the delivery bay

11:42.114 --> 11:44.083
and wait for him
to bail with the merch.

11:44.116 --> 11:46.185
Plus, I get to work for
my best friend Eric,

11:46.218 --> 11:47.619
who's a sweetheart.

11:47.652 --> 11:49.889
Ah, he's got sickle cell,

11:49.922 --> 11:51.590
but he's real positive about it.

11:51.623 --> 11:53.692
So, yeah, I guess, all in all,

11:53.725 --> 11:55.294
this job really
fits my lifestyle.

11:55.327 --> 11:56.528
Why do you ask?

11:56.561 --> 11:58.397
Oh, um...

11:58.430 --> 11:59.598
I'm a writer.

11:59.631 --> 12:02.234
Ooh.
I was looking for a subject.

12:02.267 --> 12:03.602
So, let me ask you something.

12:03.635 --> 12:05.637
If you were offered the job,
would you write,

12:05.670 --> 12:08.540
say, a novelization of a movie?

12:08.573 --> 12:11.110
Are you serious?

12:11.143 --> 12:12.711
Bec-Because I would love that!

12:12.744 --> 12:14.113
Oh, my God. Wait right here.

12:14.146 --> 12:15.380
I'm gonna be right back!

12:15.414 --> 12:18.583
Come on, come on.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.297
Oh, my God.

12:32.331 --> 12:34.466
What is that?
That is delightful!

12:43.342 --> 12:46.111
Hey, uh... wha-what's your name?

12:46.145 --> 12:48.948
Thanks, but I'm just
not interested.

12:48.981 --> 12:50.649
Wh... what? No.

12:50.682 --> 12:52.017
I'm not gay, no.

12:52.051 --> 12:53.152
My friend, over there,

12:53.185 --> 12:54.987
with the sauce on her face,
she wanted me

12:55.020 --> 12:57.356
to come, uh, talk to,
talk to you for her.

12:57.389 --> 13:00.192
Well, tell her thanks,

13:00.225 --> 13:01.660
but I'm actually gay.

13:01.693 --> 13:03.462
Ah.

13:03.495 --> 13:04.629
Okay.

13:04.663 --> 13:06.665
Sorry.

13:10.202 --> 13:13.172
Wait, you said you weren't
interested in me.

13:13.205 --> 13:14.706
Right.

13:14.739 --> 13:16.541
But you're gay. Yes.

13:16.575 --> 13:19.211
I don't understand.

13:19.244 --> 13:20.445
I can't do it.

13:20.479 --> 13:22.381
I can't buy stuff. Why?

13:22.414 --> 13:24.725
It's like, my old stuff was
just stuff I accrued over time.

13:24.749 --> 13:27.052
Crap I stole during
my shoplifting days.

13:27.086 --> 13:28.720
Shit I inherited
from that old lady

13:28.753 --> 13:30.155
who thought
I was her granddaughter.

13:30.189 --> 13:32.491
And now I have to
completely furnish,

13:32.524 --> 13:34.459
from scratch,
the life of an adult woman

13:34.493 --> 13:36.996
and I have no clue
how to do that.

13:37.930 --> 13:39.865
Anyway, Jimmy doesn't even

13:39.899 --> 13:41.867
want to make space for me
in his house.

13:41.901 --> 13:43.468
That's why
you need stuff, Gretch.

13:43.502 --> 13:44.870
To stake your claim.

13:44.904 --> 13:46.505
Get your shit up
in those crevasses.

13:46.538 --> 13:48.407
Besides, stuff is the best.

13:48.440 --> 13:50.375
You can never get
lonely with stuff.

13:50.409 --> 13:52.577
And there are so many
examples of stuff...

13:52.611 --> 13:54.679
Ice cube trays
shaped like high heels.

13:54.713 --> 13:55.915
Towels.

13:55.948 --> 13:57.582
Smaller towels for your butt.

13:57.616 --> 14:00.185
Chairs, which I guess
are also for your butt.

14:00.219 --> 14:01.753
Okay, got it.

14:01.786 --> 14:03.588
Wait, so you...

14:03.622 --> 14:06.425
like her, but you're
trolling for dudes for her?

14:06.458 --> 14:08.260
What a bitch.

14:08.293 --> 14:09.929
She is so using you.

14:09.962 --> 14:11.430
Instead of talking
to dudes for her,

14:11.463 --> 14:13.698
you should be lining up
some sweet ass for yourself.

14:13.732 --> 14:16.601
Or if you prefer it...
"hot puss."

14:16.635 --> 14:18.203
You're right.

14:18.237 --> 14:19.380
You see that cocktail waitress

14:19.404 --> 14:20.439
with the brown hair?

14:20.472 --> 14:21.873
Yeah.

14:21.907 --> 14:23.208
She's a friend of ours.

14:23.242 --> 14:25.077
And she needs to stop dating

14:25.110 --> 14:27.079
married baseball players.

14:27.112 --> 14:28.447
I'll introduce you.

14:28.480 --> 14:30.115
Okay, thanks.

14:30.149 --> 14:31.716
And then once
you get her number,

14:31.750 --> 14:34.086
Mm-hmm.
Bring your friend a wet wipe.

14:43.662 --> 14:45.140
You've been standing
here for 20 minutes.

14:45.164 --> 14:46.631
Can I help you find something?

14:46.665 --> 14:49.568
No, I'm fine.

14:49.601 --> 14:51.971
I'm waiting for someone.

14:52.004 --> 14:54.806
My son... actually.

14:54.839 --> 14:56.108
Jayden?

14:56.141 --> 14:57.309
Cart paralysis.

14:57.342 --> 14:58.877
It's very common.

14:58.910 --> 15:00.245
What do you need to get?

15:00.279 --> 15:02.747
Everything!

15:02.781 --> 15:04.449
I just moved in
with my boyfriend

15:04.483 --> 15:05.985
and I don't have any stuff

15:06.018 --> 15:07.786
except for a food processor

15:07.819 --> 15:10.155
and, like, 19 thongs,
because even though

15:10.189 --> 15:12.824
at first we were like,
"I am not wearing that,"

15:12.857 --> 15:15.660
the patriarchy somehow convinced
us that visible panty lines

15:15.694 --> 15:17.605
were unacceptable, so now
I've just grown accustomed

15:17.629 --> 15:18.998
to the feeling of a fabric rope

15:19.031 --> 15:21.166
against my actual asshole
all day.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.667
And anyway, even if I did buy

15:22.701 --> 15:25.070
the stuff of a life,
there's nowhere for me to put it

15:25.104 --> 15:27.506
because I'm not sure this dude
really wanted me to move in

15:27.539 --> 15:29.174
because I'm
an irresponsible monster

15:29.208 --> 15:32.677
who burned down her apartment
with her vibrator!

15:32.711 --> 15:34.013
I'm just gonna leave you

15:34.046 --> 15:36.115
with this checklist
for college freshmen.

15:42.887 --> 15:46.291
"Hair dryer.

15:46.325 --> 15:48.327
Hair dryer..."

15:55.034 --> 15:57.036
"Shower shoes."

16:06.845 --> 16:08.447
More wings.

16:08.480 --> 16:10.049
Uh... I said

16:10.082 --> 16:12.884
I'll tell you
when I've had enough.

16:16.255 --> 16:18.415
I really like your shirt...
It shows off your shoulder.

16:20.759 --> 16:22.861
Did you find
everything you need?

16:22.894 --> 16:25.230
Why, yes, I did. Thank you.

16:25.264 --> 16:27.232
And, like, 20 things
I didn't know existed.

16:27.266 --> 16:29.901
Little dryer balls that beat
the shit out of your clothes?

16:29.934 --> 16:32.204
A banana holder?

16:32.237 --> 16:34.739
Get off the counter,
banana, you fancy now.

16:34.773 --> 16:36.241
And I'm gonna make my own soda.

16:36.275 --> 16:37.376
Can I make champagne?

16:37.409 --> 16:38.410
Don't know. Gonna try.

16:38.443 --> 16:40.579
Fantastic. Yeah.

16:40.612 --> 16:41.913
Starting a whole new life.

16:41.946 --> 16:44.716
It's scary but... I'm doing it.

16:44.749 --> 16:46.418
This is a lot of stuff.

16:46.451 --> 16:49.121
Did you need help with
any storage solutions today?

16:50.622 --> 16:52.757
Please don't.

16:52.791 --> 16:54.793
I'm so sorry.

17:10.709 --> 17:11.943
Where's your stuff?

17:11.976 --> 17:13.877
Why do I have to go
buy everything?

17:13.912 --> 17:15.380
Uh, because you have nothing.

17:15.414 --> 17:16.615
I know!

17:16.647 --> 17:18.217
But why do I have to be the one

17:18.250 --> 17:19.294
making all the adjustments?

17:19.318 --> 17:20.551
How has your life changed

17:20.585 --> 17:21.796
since I moved in,
other than you get

17:21.819 --> 17:23.622
all of this next to you
every night?

17:23.655 --> 17:25.124
Not one bit.

17:25.156 --> 17:27.192
Any change for you
is purely theoretical.

17:27.226 --> 17:28.627
"Oh, I live with someone now."

17:28.660 --> 17:30.595
Big stinking deal.
I have nothing.

17:30.629 --> 17:32.631
I told you, we would find
room for your things.

17:32.664 --> 17:34.733
I don't want to live
around you, Jimmy.

17:34.766 --> 17:36.535
I don't want
to live in the crevasses.

17:36.568 --> 17:38.137
I'm not moss!

17:38.170 --> 17:40.472
Uh... See you later.

17:40.505 --> 17:42.474
There you are.

17:42.507 --> 17:45.910
So... what movie
are we adapting?

17:45.944 --> 17:47.979
What?

17:48.012 --> 17:49.414
Oh, no, it was a hypothetical.

17:49.448 --> 17:51.316
And for me, not for you.

17:51.350 --> 17:53.585
But I just quit my job.

17:53.618 --> 17:55.587
Damn it!
This keeps happening to me.

17:55.620 --> 17:57.122
Oh, my God!

17:57.156 --> 17:59.458
I told Eric to suck my dick!

17:59.491 --> 18:00.825
Why would I do that?

18:00.859 --> 18:02.761
I love that guy.

18:08.367 --> 18:10.169
I-I, I got your text.

18:10.202 --> 18:11.636
What's the crisis?

18:11.670 --> 18:15.006
And h-h-how do you still have
buffalo sauce on your face?

18:15.039 --> 18:17.676
I went to the mall today
looking to take my mind off

18:17.709 --> 18:20.779
how lonely I am and maybe
hook up with a nice guy.

18:20.812 --> 18:24.616
Turns out, I was looking
in the wrong place.

18:24.649 --> 18:27.952
The answer was right in
front of me the whole time.

18:28.987 --> 18:30.222
My phone!

18:31.890 --> 18:34.025
I don't need to be
looking in the real world.

18:34.058 --> 18:36.127
I need to be looking online.

18:36.161 --> 18:38.997
So, what I am doing here?

18:39.030 --> 18:40.965
I need sexy photos

18:40.999 --> 18:42.367
for my profile.

18:42.401 --> 18:44.035
I can help.

18:47.339 --> 18:49.841
So, are you going to, uh,

18:49.874 --> 18:53.845
call that cute waitress
you were talking to?

18:53.878 --> 18:56.648
Nah. We have nothing in common.

18:58.683 --> 19:00.852
How did you get
wing sauce down there?

19:01.753 --> 19:03.021
Russell, it's Jimmy.

19:03.054 --> 19:04.389
Um, those jobs you mentioned...

19:04.423 --> 19:06.191
You can find me something.

19:06.225 --> 19:08.493
Probably not the popcorn thing.

19:08.527 --> 19:11.530
Also, this counts as a meeting,
so you owe me a drink.

19:24.709 --> 19:27.546
Hey. Um... listen.

19:27.579 --> 19:29.681
I understand that my actions

19:29.714 --> 19:32.150
could lead you
to feel a bit unwelcome,

19:32.183 --> 19:36.154
and I'll work on not being
such a control freak.

19:36.187 --> 19:38.923
I mean, this is your house, too.

19:38.957 --> 19:41.426
So, I made you...

19:41.460 --> 19:43.428
a nightstand.

19:44.629 --> 19:46.197
It's called a Klüf.

19:46.231 --> 19:47.932
Cool, thanks.

19:49.067 --> 19:51.736
What, what is that?
What are you doing?

19:51.770 --> 19:52.937
Why-why are you doing that?

19:52.971 --> 19:54.449
Well, you just said
it's my house, too,

19:54.473 --> 19:56.608
so I'm just putting
some art on our walls.

19:56.641 --> 19:57.742
Okay.

19:57.776 --> 19:59.444
But you see, ev-everything here

19:59.478 --> 20:01.946
is meticulously curated so...

20:01.980 --> 20:03.282
I don't know, Jimmy.

20:03.315 --> 20:05.617
I really like this poster.

20:05.650 --> 20:06.718
Look at that cat.

20:06.751 --> 20:07.786
He's so cool.

20:07.819 --> 20:09.588
All right.

20:09.621 --> 20:11.790
If you really want me
to feel comfortable here

20:11.823 --> 20:14.326
maybe there's another way.

20:17.796 --> 20:20.465
What about the-the Klüf?

20:20.499 --> 20:22.100
You can use it.
I'll just take yours.

20:23.635 --> 20:27.138
Thank you
for making room for me.

20:27.171 --> 20:28.973
You're welcome.

20:29.007 --> 20:31.410
I like our place.

20:31.443 --> 20:34.145
Me, too.

20:34.178 --> 20:35.814
Guess what Paul's
definition of love is.

20:35.847 --> 20:37.449
What?

20:37.482 --> 20:39.418
Putting someone else's needs
above yours.

20:39.451 --> 20:40.419
Ew! I know.

20:40.452 --> 20:42.454
He's such a gump.

20:44.789 --> 20:46.491
Come on, let's
tackle the closet.

20:46.525 --> 20:51.095
