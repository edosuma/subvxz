WEBVTT

00:02.444 --> 00:04.162
Hey, Ming, if you could time travel,

00:04.287 --> 00:05.620
what if you could go to the future?

00:05.655 --> 00:06.636
What would you do?

00:06.753 --> 00:09.016
I'd go maybe 30 years,
see how my life turned out.

00:09.136 --> 00:11.432
- You'd look yourself up?
- Yeah, I'd look myself up.

00:11.552 --> 00:14.083
What if you caught your older
self masturbating feverishly?

00:14.117 --> 00:15.255
[All laugh]
Yeah.

00:15.289 --> 00:16.295
If I'm 77?

00:16.329 --> 00:17.716
- You're in a wheelchair.
- Yeah.

00:17.836 --> 00:19.101
You just pull down the blanket

00:19.135 --> 00:20.167
and all of a sudden, you're like,

00:20.201 --> 00:21.767
- "What--what's myself doing?"
- Right.

00:21.802 --> 00:23.833
Oh, no.
[All laugh]

00:23.868 --> 00:24.836
Don't do it, Ming.

00:24.871 --> 00:26.004
That wouldn't be that weird.

00:26.039 --> 00:27.070
He also didn't mention

00:27.104 --> 00:28.870
you're in a playground.
[All laugh]

00:28.904 --> 00:32.508
You're just like, "Oh, no."

00:32.542 --> 00:35.577
If I had those faculties
in 30 years, I'd be happy.

00:35.611 --> 00:37.779
What, faculties to just
masturbate in public?

00:37.813 --> 00:39.314
No--

00:39.348 --> 00:42.354
- I'd think you lost a lot of
them if you're doing that.

00:42.379 --> 00:52.579

01:27.195 --> 01:29.830
Hello and welcome to another
episode of <i>Comic Book Men.</i>

01:29.864 --> 01:31.865
I'm your host, Kevin Smith.

01:31.899 --> 01:33.533
- Fred Johnson.
- Walt Flannigan.

01:33.567 --> 01:35.436
- Ming Chen.
- And Michael Zapcic.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.538
As we all know from
<i>Spider-Man,</i>

01:37.572 --> 01:40.274
with great power comes
great responsibility.

01:40.309 --> 01:41.576
But first you've gotta have the power.

01:41.610 --> 01:44.578
What super power would you choose?

01:44.613 --> 01:46.413
Definitely invisibility.

01:46.448 --> 01:48.650
I'm surprised Johnson
didn't pick telekinesis.

01:48.684 --> 01:50.218
You don't have to move for nothing.

01:50.252 --> 01:51.586
- Oh, yeah.
- Just--I'm hungry.

01:51.621 --> 01:53.355
Turkey leg right at you.

01:53.389 --> 01:54.822
I don't even have to raise my hand.

01:54.857 --> 01:56.991
- No.
- I can be like ahh.

01:57.025 --> 01:57.992
What about yours, man?

01:58.026 --> 02:00.394
I would pick healing factor.

02:00.428 --> 02:03.763
Like Wolverine's, uh,
mutant healing factor

02:03.798 --> 02:05.532
which means if he gets cut,

02:05.566 --> 02:07.767
in 30 seconds the wound heals itself.

02:07.801 --> 02:08.800
And he doesn't age, right?

02:08.835 --> 02:10.269
Uh, almost,
his aging process--

02:10.304 --> 02:11.270
- That's what I want.
- Yeah, so you don't wanna--

02:11.304 --> 02:12.772
- I don't wanna die.

02:12.806 --> 02:14.908
Well, you don't wanna die but,
you also wanna look young, too.

02:14.942 --> 02:17.845
'Cause you could be an
eternal-looking 100 year old.

02:17.879 --> 02:20.281
But you're like, no,
I wanna look sexy, bub.

02:20.315 --> 02:21.682
- I wanna be--
- Exactly.

02:21.716 --> 02:23.217
- I wanna be in bars.
- Snikt.

02:23.252 --> 02:25.153
[Laughs] Yeah.

02:25.187 --> 02:26.621
I'd go with, uh, teleportation.

02:26.655 --> 02:28.323
It's a bad power to choose.

02:28.357 --> 02:30.057
- It's so dangerous.
- Why?

02:30.092 --> 02:32.426
Because if you're
teleporting somewhere,

02:32.461 --> 02:34.228
how do you know you're not gonna
teleport into something

02:34.262 --> 02:35.830
that's, like, solid?

02:35.864 --> 02:37.365
What if a car is parked
in front of a Boulder?

02:37.399 --> 02:38.466
[Laughs]

02:38.500 --> 02:39.900
What, in the world of <i>Star Trek?</i>

02:39.934 --> 02:41.935
They're like, "Beam us down to
this lifeless planet."

02:41.970 --> 02:44.271
Like, "There's a car here
and I'm trapped! Tow it!"

02:44.305 --> 02:46.472
I'm dying slowly!"

02:46.507 --> 02:48.307
It's a risk I'll take.

02:48.342 --> 02:49.809
What about you, Kev?

02:49.843 --> 02:51.644
If I had to pick one, it's not
one that's very sexy.

02:51.679 --> 02:52.846
Patience.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.014
Super patience.

02:54.048 --> 02:55.015
They haven't done that character yet.

02:55.049 --> 02:57.050
The guy that could just out-wait
anybody.

02:57.084 --> 02:58.852
- I got the time.
- Panel after panel...

02:58.887 --> 03:00.020
Of a dude, like...

03:00.055 --> 03:02.389
That's an exciting comic.

03:02.424 --> 03:04.024
Crime's happening all around him

03:04.059 --> 03:07.061
and he's just like,
"I'll wait it out."

03:10.732 --> 03:13.734
Ming, do you think even
though a magazine's from '78

03:13.768 --> 03:16.403
their offer for a man's girdle
is still valid?

03:16.437 --> 03:18.571
Look at that, man, that could be me.

03:18.606 --> 03:20.206
- I've never seen them here.
- You should carry 'em here.

03:20.240 --> 03:23.676
Jay and silent Bob's girdle?

03:23.710 --> 03:25.311
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, how are you?

03:25.345 --> 03:27.446
- How you doing?
- What can we do for you today?

03:27.480 --> 03:29.982
I collect a lot of old
toys from the '60s and '70s.

03:30.016 --> 03:30.983
How about <i>6 Million Dollar</i>
<i>Man,</i> you into that?

03:31.017 --> 03:32.551
<i>6 Million Dollar Man.</i>

03:32.586 --> 03:35.388
We got a C10 <i>6 Million Dollar</i>
<i>Man</i> in the store, just came in.

03:35.422 --> 03:36.989
- Really?
- Yep.

03:37.024 --> 03:38.491
Well, I'll take a look at that.

03:38.525 --> 03:40.426
Look out the window, Mike.

03:40.460 --> 03:41.761
Holy [bleep].

03:41.796 --> 03:42.862
[Bleep] Batmobile!

03:42.897 --> 03:43.863
[Laughs]

03:43.898 --> 03:49.168
That's insane.

03:49.203 --> 03:52.205
The Batmobile came to Jay and
Silent Bob's Secret Stash?

03:52.239 --> 03:53.973
The Adam West Batmobile.

03:54.007 --> 03:56.876
It was actually a replica that
this gentleman had made.

03:56.910 --> 03:57.943
That makes me wanna cry.

03:57.978 --> 04:00.880
The six-year-old
Kev inside of me is

04:00.914 --> 04:02.081
just like, "It came to your store"

04:02.116 --> 04:03.850
and you weren't even there."

04:03.884 --> 04:05.685
This is like something
out of a Shel Silverstein book.

04:05.719 --> 04:07.353
It's heartbreaking.
[All laugh]

04:07.388 --> 04:08.521
Utterly heartbreaking.

04:08.555 --> 04:09.722
Is that your daily driver?

04:09.756 --> 04:11.791
Nah, nah, I collec--I just
collect them.

04:11.825 --> 04:15.461
I'm a big Batmobile fan, so I
have a Michael Keaton Batmobile.

04:15.496 --> 04:18.897
I have a '66 and, uh,
Green Hornet's black beauty.

04:18.932 --> 04:20.265
What's yours valued at right now?

04:20.300 --> 04:22.935
That Batmobile was signed
by George Barris.

04:22.969 --> 04:24.769
It's also signed by
Adam west and Burt ward.

04:24.804 --> 04:28.173
So, it's 135-140.

04:28.207 --> 04:29.441
Is it street legal?

04:29.475 --> 04:30.442
Yeah.

04:30.476 --> 04:31.977
That Batmobile was used for the

04:32.011 --> 04:35.113
movie <i>Rockstar</i> starring Jennifer
Aniston and Mark Wahlberg.

04:35.148 --> 04:36.615
How fast can it go?

04:36.649 --> 04:39.485
Well, mark pushed it 130 on the set.

04:39.519 --> 04:42.154
- 130 miles it goes?
- Yeah.

04:42.189 --> 04:44.957
It has actually a 460 underneath.

04:44.992 --> 04:47.426
You don't have to charge to
let anybody drive it?

04:47.461 --> 04:49.262
- Why, you wanna drive it?
- I don't know.

04:49.296 --> 04:51.431
Because, you know, if we
wanna negotiate something,

04:51.465 --> 04:52.498
we can do that, too, I mean...

04:52.533 --> 04:54.234
All right, all right.

04:54.268 --> 04:56.002
I let you drive
the Batmobile if you can

04:56.036 --> 04:58.204
hook me up with something I like here.

04:58.238 --> 04:59.539
Oh, you guys wanna come check it out?

04:59.573 --> 05:00.873
- Yeah, definitely.
- Yeah, yeah.

05:00.907 --> 05:02.374
- Let's go.
- Ming.

05:02.409 --> 05:05.011
Just watch the store while we
check out the Batmobile.

05:05.045 --> 05:06.746
- You serious?
- Absolutely.

05:06.780 --> 05:08.948
- No way.
- Oh, my God.

05:08.982 --> 05:10.015
You hang out in here,
pretend you're looking

05:10.050 --> 05:12.218
at wonder woman's invisible jet.

05:15.289 --> 05:16.990
- Check it out.
- Wow.

05:17.024 --> 05:18.592
This is it, my friend.

05:18.626 --> 05:20.794
My God.

05:20.829 --> 05:22.997
Screw you guys,
I'm not staying inside.

05:23.031 --> 05:26.066
[All laugh]

05:26.101 --> 05:27.234
Wow, can I sit in it?

05:27.269 --> 05:29.136
Yeah, sure.

05:29.171 --> 05:31.239
Oh... whose signature is that?

05:31.273 --> 05:32.340
George Barris.

05:32.374 --> 05:34.041
Oh, my God.

05:34.076 --> 05:35.543
What's that?

05:35.577 --> 05:36.844
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
don't, whoa, whoa,

05:36.878 --> 05:38.112
don't hit all the butt--you
don't know

05:38.146 --> 05:39.580
what they're gonna do, right?

05:39.614 --> 05:41.214
Calm your batpole, bitch.

05:41.249 --> 05:44.751
I'll push the buttons if I want.

05:44.786 --> 05:47.754
Did that reach
the kid in you on any level?

05:47.788 --> 05:49.089
It definitely did.

05:49.123 --> 05:52.191
Like, I a--I rarely
touch my inner kid.

05:52.226 --> 05:53.760
- Right.
- You know, it rarely gets, um--

05:53.794 --> 05:55.228
[All laugh]
- Sounds dirty, but isn't.

05:55.262 --> 05:56.263
It's his "inner" kid.

05:56.297 --> 05:58.465
Yeah.

05:58.499 --> 06:00.600
Look, it even has a little TV in it.

06:00.635 --> 06:02.169
Oh, you got a utility belt back there.

06:02.203 --> 06:03.370
Bat radar.

06:03.404 --> 06:06.373
Look at Batman's, like, primitive GPS.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.909
Man, it's like a compass on
the--on the...

06:08.943 --> 06:11.045
What other bat goodies
you got in this car?

06:11.079 --> 06:13.280
We have the bat shield
right behind you.

06:13.314 --> 06:15.982
Oh, the batshield, Walt.

06:16.017 --> 06:17.984
- Oh, Walt, look at that.
- Batshield.

06:18.018 --> 06:19.585
That's supposed to be, like,
a bulletproof shield, right?

06:19.620 --> 06:20.586
Exactly.

06:20.621 --> 06:22.387
I remember that.

06:22.422 --> 06:23.855
- Corny.
- Better than this--

06:23.890 --> 06:25.323
Is that Adam West?

06:25.358 --> 06:27.325
- Yes, that's Adam west.
- Oh!

06:27.360 --> 06:29.161
What's that?

06:29.195 --> 06:30.496
Is that a cowl?

06:30.530 --> 06:32.431
No way.

06:32.465 --> 06:34.300
- Oh!
- Wait a second.

06:34.334 --> 06:36.902
It sounds like your wedding night.

06:36.937 --> 06:38.905
He's like, "Oh... Oh..."

06:38.939 --> 06:40.406
[All laugh]

06:40.441 --> 06:43.210
Favorite Batmobile across any era.

06:43.244 --> 06:45.512
For me, it'll always be
the Tim Burton Batmobile.

06:45.547 --> 06:47.715
Aerodynamically,
it doesn't even make sense.

06:47.750 --> 06:51.185
But, in the movie it looks
so amazing, so badass.

06:51.219 --> 06:53.887
My favorite one, probably,
is the Jerry Robinson one.

06:53.921 --> 06:55.822
With the big, gigantic bat
head on the front cover

06:55.856 --> 06:57.290
and the eyes that light up.

06:57.325 --> 06:59.825
I'm still all about
the '66 Adam west Batmobile.

06:59.860 --> 07:01.193
All the gadgets
started with "bat."

07:01.228 --> 07:02.461
So, you know, there's no question.

07:02.496 --> 07:04.163
I'm between cars right now,
[All laugh]

07:04.197 --> 07:09.000
So, I guess I'd take any of them.

07:09.035 --> 07:11.270
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

07:11.304 --> 07:12.404
Let's go!

07:12.439 --> 07:15.675
- To the batcave!
- Whoo!

07:15.709 --> 07:16.876
Let's get it up to 100.

07:16.911 --> 07:19.212
Greetings, citizen.

07:19.247 --> 07:21.248
- Obey the law.
- Don't jaywalk.

07:23.718 --> 07:26.721
I'm just gonna hit things.

07:27.957 --> 07:30.292
What does that thing do?

07:30.326 --> 07:31.426
- Oh, crap.
- Uh-oh.

07:31.461 --> 07:32.427
Oops.

07:32.461 --> 07:35.730
Sorry about that.
[Laughs]

07:35.764 --> 07:38.633
Ladies, ever been hit on by Batman?

07:38.667 --> 07:39.934
I finally got respect.

07:39.968 --> 07:42.169
Best day of my life.

07:42.203 --> 07:43.303
Don't tell my wife I said that.

07:43.338 --> 07:44.571
[Laughs]

07:44.606 --> 07:46.140
Straighten it out a little.

07:46.174 --> 07:48.708
There you go.

07:48.743 --> 07:50.210
It's pretty amazing, man.

07:50.244 --> 07:51.645
I finally got a ride, too.

07:51.679 --> 07:53.447
I didn't have to take the bus.

07:53.481 --> 07:54.515
Thank you so much.

07:54.549 --> 07:55.549
Hey, no, thank you very much.

07:55.584 --> 07:56.550
- Thank you very much.
- Fantastic.

07:56.585 --> 07:59.053
No problem.

07:59.087 --> 08:00.954
I wish every day could be like that.

08:00.988 --> 08:02.289
Like, something cool
like that could come in.

08:02.323 --> 08:04.024
But then I guess if it was every day,

08:04.058 --> 08:05.525
then it would get boring, right?

08:05.559 --> 08:07.193
If every day was like that?

08:07.228 --> 08:09.663
No, man, every day could
be a wonderful party.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.064
Why not? It should be, man.

08:11.098 --> 08:12.065
Because what happens when we die?

08:12.099 --> 08:13.066
We don't know.

08:13.101 --> 08:14.101
I bet you in heaven,

08:14.135 --> 08:15.302
everyone has a Batmobile.

08:15.336 --> 08:16.603
That needs to be on a monument

08:16.638 --> 08:17.872
if not on a bumper sticker.

08:17.906 --> 08:20.174
"In heaven,
everyone has a Batmobile."

08:20.209 --> 08:21.476
That makes me hope I go to hell.

08:21.510 --> 08:25.180
[All laugh]

08:25.214 --> 08:27.148
[Phone rings]

08:27.183 --> 08:28.483
Comics.

08:28.517 --> 08:30.084
Hey, man, what's going on?

08:30.119 --> 08:32.753
All right, yeah, a hockey game, huh?

08:32.788 --> 08:34.255
What time you think you're coming in?

08:34.289 --> 08:36.157
All right, man, I'll see you then.

08:36.191 --> 08:37.890
All right, man, bye.

08:37.926 --> 08:41.660
Hey, guys, Kevin called and told
me to tell you, get the boys,

08:41.696 --> 08:44.364
get them together and, uh,
get a hockey game going.

08:44.398 --> 08:47.400
Whenever I'm back
in the red bank area,

08:47.434 --> 08:51.037
the one thing I want is balls
flying at me, like crazy.

08:51.071 --> 08:53.273
I want 'em all over me and whatnot.

08:53.307 --> 08:55.008
And, uh, when I say that, of course,

08:55.042 --> 08:57.177
I'm talking about playing hockey.

08:57.211 --> 09:01.214
Hockey played such an important
part in my development that

09:01.249 --> 09:02.482
it wound up in <i>Clerks.</i>

09:02.517 --> 09:04.584
And that's in the movie because

09:04.618 --> 09:05.918
that's what we did in real life.

09:05.953 --> 09:07.921
That was a part of our world.

09:07.955 --> 09:10.557
So keeping it alive, I think,
to me has always been

09:10.591 --> 09:13.392
a part of tethering to the past.

09:13.427 --> 09:15.661
Are you playing?

09:15.695 --> 09:16.996
What kind of question is that?

09:17.030 --> 09:18.464
Well, I'm--you
have a bad knee.

09:18.498 --> 09:21.600
Did I--did I say that Kevin
called and we're playing?

09:21.635 --> 09:22.601
Yes, I'm playing.

09:22.635 --> 09:23.735
- Are you playing?
- Yeah.

09:23.770 --> 09:25.371
He called, I'm playing.

09:25.405 --> 09:26.739
When was the last time you even ran?

09:26.773 --> 09:28.708
I'm in peak physical condition, Ming.

09:28.742 --> 09:30.109
- Peak physical...
- I'm ready to do it.

09:30.144 --> 09:31.578
Mike, do you have a stick?

09:31.612 --> 09:32.679
Yeah, you do.

09:32.713 --> 09:33.980
All right, I'll get you a stick.

09:34.015 --> 09:35.382
Well, don't wear those jeans, though.

09:35.416 --> 09:37.217
And it's regular hockey,
not field hockey.

09:37.252 --> 09:38.452
Oh, crap.

09:38.486 --> 09:40.721
Yeah, leave your skirt at home.

09:40.756 --> 09:42.123
All right, let's go.

09:42.157 --> 09:44.459
- Stop slamming the counter.
- I know, and go call them.

09:44.493 --> 09:45.660
All right, all right, all right.

09:45.695 --> 09:47.429
Sorry.

09:47.463 --> 09:49.765
New Jersey is not,
uh, what most people

09:49.799 --> 09:52.234
would consider a hotbed of hockey.

09:52.268 --> 09:55.871
But, uh, the reason I think
most of us are into hockey

09:55.906 --> 09:57.440
is because of Walt.

09:57.474 --> 09:59.242
I had gotten Bryan
into it a little bit.

09:59.276 --> 10:02.111
We became friends,
and, uh, I imagine you

10:02.146 --> 10:03.513
didn't know anything
about hockey--

10:03.547 --> 10:05.014
- Nothing, nothing at all.
- At that point in your life.

10:05.048 --> 10:06.716
So Walter was like,
"Play goalie."

10:06.750 --> 10:08.251
'Cause I was like, "I don't
know if I can handle a ball"

10:08.286 --> 10:10.354
or anything like that or
chase it around the court."

10:10.388 --> 10:11.988
He's like, "Play goalie, we
always need a goalie, man."

10:12.023 --> 10:13.256
It's either you
or a garbage can."

10:13.291 --> 10:14.291
And I was like, "Well I can
be a garbage can!"

10:14.325 --> 10:16.260
[All laugh]

10:16.294 --> 10:18.095
All right, here you go.

10:18.130 --> 10:19.096
This is my lucky stick.

10:19.131 --> 10:21.132
- How's that feel?
- Good.

10:21.166 --> 10:23.401
This is the guy you're gonna
take lessons from?

10:23.435 --> 10:25.670
I've scored more goals
than you ever have.

10:25.705 --> 10:26.671
No, that's not true.

10:26.706 --> 10:28.039
When it counted, not these

10:28.073 --> 10:29.707
little pick-up games you use to
play at the tennis courts.

10:29.742 --> 10:31.576
Oh, you're gonna tell Kevin
Smith the formative games

10:31.610 --> 10:33.311
we used to play at
the rec don't count?

10:33.345 --> 10:34.645
I used to play soccer back in the day.

10:34.679 --> 10:36.313
- Does that count?
- Nah.

10:36.348 --> 10:39.783
Nobody in America cares about soccer.

10:39.817 --> 10:41.518
All right, lesson number one:
Dribbling.

10:41.552 --> 10:43.886
- Keep your stick soft and supple.
- Right.

10:43.921 --> 10:44.987
Feel the ball on your stick.

10:45.022 --> 10:46.388
Just feel the ball on your
stick, Mike.

10:46.423 --> 10:47.756
Is that Mike's next lesson?

10:47.791 --> 10:49.825
This is how he seduces you, Mike.

10:49.860 --> 10:50.960
- [Laughs]
- Look out.

10:50.994 --> 10:52.695
Wait. Hey, hey.

10:52.729 --> 10:55.399
Eye on the ball, eye on the ball.

10:55.433 --> 10:56.734
How's that?

10:56.768 --> 10:58.169
You look like you're dancing.

10:58.203 --> 10:59.670
Mike, no.

10:59.704 --> 11:00.771
[Sighs]

11:00.806 --> 11:01.773
[Laughs]

11:01.807 --> 11:02.808
All right, lesson number two:

11:02.842 --> 11:04.109
- Passing.
- All right.

11:04.143 --> 11:05.644
You know we're playing on almost

11:05.678 --> 11:07.780
- a regulation-size rink, right?
- Yeah.

11:07.814 --> 11:09.181
Bring it back, bring it back.

11:09.216 --> 11:11.150
You think at any point
you guys will move, like,

11:11.184 --> 11:13.652
more than ten inches
away from each other?

11:13.687 --> 11:15.721
You're the one I'm worried about.

11:15.755 --> 11:17.423
- What about me?
- You got the bad knee.

11:17.457 --> 11:18.691
I just run right around you.

11:18.725 --> 11:21.093
Ready.

11:21.128 --> 11:23.462
This is bulk, this is
hard to get around.

11:23.497 --> 11:24.730
One more time, one more time.

11:24.764 --> 11:26.431
Mike, take that ball,
try to get it around him.

11:26.466 --> 11:27.966
All right, fine.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.200
Look at this, man.

11:29.235 --> 11:30.235
Look at this!

11:30.270 --> 11:31.337
You guys are nothing.

11:31.371 --> 11:33.205
What the [bleep] are you guys doing?

11:33.239 --> 11:34.707
Ming's "teaching."

11:34.741 --> 11:35.808
We got customers in there.

11:35.843 --> 11:37.076
Mike's never played before.

11:37.111 --> 11:38.478
I wanted to show him some pointers.

11:38.512 --> 11:39.746
Is he just showing off or is he

11:39.781 --> 11:40.981
- actually showing him something?
- Showing off.

11:41.016 --> 11:42.149
I'm not showing off.

11:42.184 --> 11:43.250
I'm worried about him.

11:43.285 --> 11:44.485
I'm a little worried about you, too.

11:44.519 --> 11:46.020
Don't worry about me,
worry about yourself.

11:46.054 --> 11:47.188
I'm ready.

11:47.223 --> 11:49.524
All right, bring your game
tomorrow then.

11:49.559 --> 11:50.692
Let's go inside now

11:50.727 --> 11:52.594
- 'cause we're done.
- All right.

11:52.629 --> 11:55.364
I'm winded, man.

11:55.398 --> 11:57.399
We're gonna get crushed.

11:59.336 --> 12:00.736
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

12:00.771 --> 12:03.006
I self-publish autobiographical
comic books.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.007
Very impressive.

12:04.041 --> 12:05.475
I'm more interested in what's

12:05.510 --> 12:07.844
- next to this.
- Oh, my God.

12:07.879 --> 12:09.112
I brought you my prized possession.

12:09.147 --> 12:11.214
This is my lightsaber hilt.

12:11.249 --> 12:12.415
Do you think it's the real deal?

12:14.604 --> 12:16.056
Do superheroes retire?

12:16.090 --> 12:17.391
Yeah, I would have to think that,

12:17.425 --> 12:19.326
you know, superheroes retire.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.961
And you know, that's when
they look back and reflect

12:21.996 --> 12:23.296
and be like,
"Man, I saved the world."

12:23.330 --> 12:24.564
But what if, like, they retire

12:24.598 --> 12:26.432
and then they got nothing to do,
they get bored.

12:26.466 --> 12:29.267
They work at a--a box store as,
like, a greeter.

12:29.302 --> 12:31.503
He's, like, checking your
receipt as you leave.

12:31.537 --> 12:34.039
Like, that's the level
of his crime fighting.

12:34.073 --> 12:36.441
To make sure that you didn't
shoplift socks or something.

12:36.475 --> 12:39.310
It sounds to me like you're,
uh, contemplating retirement.

12:39.344 --> 12:42.146
I feel like I've already
retired--semi-retired.

12:42.180 --> 12:43.647
What have you retired from?

12:43.682 --> 12:44.815
I don't know.

12:44.850 --> 12:48.486
Hope?
[Both laugh]

12:48.521 --> 12:53.826
Oh, awesome.

12:53.860 --> 12:54.994
- Hey, how you doing?
- I'm Jonathan.

12:55.028 --> 12:56.563
- Michael.
- Hey, Michael, how's it going?

12:56.597 --> 12:57.564
You brought some stuff in?

12:57.598 --> 12:58.865
I did, I brought some, uh,

12:58.900 --> 13:00.567
original artwork for you
to take a look at.

13:00.602 --> 13:02.570
You guys might be interested in

13:02.604 --> 13:04.806
this couple of Byrne
<i>Fantastic Four</i> pages.

13:04.840 --> 13:06.040
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

13:06.074 --> 13:09.243
I self-publish autobiographical
comic books.

13:09.277 --> 13:10.978
And actually, I just got accepted into

13:11.012 --> 13:13.847
the San Diego comic con to
exhibit for the first time.

13:13.881 --> 13:15.549
- Oh, wow, congratulations.
- Yeah, yeah.

13:15.583 --> 13:16.550
What's the name of your book?

13:16.584 --> 13:18.118
It's called <i>So Buttons.</i>

13:18.152 --> 13:20.287
My grandmother used to be
like--you'd say, "So?"

13:20.321 --> 13:21.855
And she'd be like, "Sew buttons
on your underwear."

13:21.889 --> 13:23.490
That's, I guess where it--
[All laugh]

13:23.524 --> 13:24.691
That's--that was the--yeah.

13:24.725 --> 13:25.959
Kids don't say so anymore
right back now.

13:25.993 --> 13:27.660
They're more like,
"[Bleep] off, grandma."

13:27.694 --> 13:30.263
Yeah, exactly.

13:30.297 --> 13:31.964
So you just tell
the story of your life?

13:31.999 --> 13:32.965
Yeah.

13:32.999 --> 13:34.633
This is my newest one.

13:34.668 --> 13:37.337
I used to work for, uh, Robert
Redford at Sundance channel

13:37.371 --> 13:39.105
and, uh, you know, there's
a story about him in there.

13:39.139 --> 13:40.173
Very impressive.

13:40.207 --> 13:41.240
Are we gonna be in the next issue?

13:41.274 --> 13:42.408
You just might be, just might be.

13:42.442 --> 13:44.009
I met three dicks
in a comic book store.

13:44.043 --> 13:45.043
But, uh--
[All laugh]

13:45.078 --> 13:47.812
I know this is gonna sound strange,

13:47.847 --> 13:50.849
but I'm more interested in
what's next to this.

13:50.883 --> 13:52.884
The--the <i>Giant-Size Man-Thing.</i>

13:59.425 --> 14:02.327
- Can I take it out?
- Sure, take a look.

14:02.361 --> 14:04.329
This is a book that
I had as a kid, Bry.

14:04.363 --> 14:05.764
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

14:05.798 --> 14:07.999
He's so nice, he's picking
a log up off a deer.

14:08.033 --> 14:09.768
Oh, yeah, man-thing's
not a bad guy.

14:09.802 --> 14:11.236
He's just misunderstood.

14:11.270 --> 14:13.171
Kinda like, just wants
to be left alone.

14:13.206 --> 14:16.375
I'm starting to identify
with man-thing.

14:16.409 --> 14:18.410
Muck-encrusted
mockery of a man.

14:18.445 --> 14:19.411
Yes.

14:19.446 --> 14:20.846
If there was one thing I know

14:20.880 --> 14:26.051
about Flannigan, he loves a
<i>giant-size man thing.</i>

14:26.086 --> 14:28.353
I mean, what was marvel
thinking, publishing that?

14:28.387 --> 14:30.088
I mean, they had to know
the tongue-in-cheek, right?

14:30.122 --> 14:32.924
When they're, like, putting that
cover together and they're like,

14:32.958 --> 14:34.492
all right, let's put the title
<i>Giant-Size Man-Thing.</i>

14:34.526 --> 14:36.594
No one in that office
is not snickering?

14:36.628 --> 14:38.796
I'm sure they were like,
[Stifles laugh]

14:38.830 --> 14:39.997
"Go, Stan, go!"

14:40.031 --> 14:41.565
How much for
the <i>Giant-Size Man-Thing?</i>

14:41.599 --> 14:42.766
<i>Giant-Size Man-Thing?</i>

14:42.800 --> 14:45.802
- Yeah.
- Closer to 500.

14:45.837 --> 14:48.205
You know, I love it
but it's--even 500,

14:48.239 --> 14:50.440
it's a little bit more than
what we could spend today

14:50.475 --> 14:52.576
but, you know what,
I really dig your books.

14:52.610 --> 14:54.411
- Thanks.
- The paper, the colors.

14:54.445 --> 14:56.512
I mean, very professionally done

14:56.547 --> 14:58.548
and it's just, like,
it really would stand out,

14:58.582 --> 15:00.949
um, amongst other independent books.

15:00.984 --> 15:03.919
Would you think, uh,
would you give a thought to

15:03.954 --> 15:06.455
maybe having let us--blah,
blah, blah, blah.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.991
You had an easier time
proposing to your wife, Jesus.

15:09.025 --> 15:12.293
Do you think maybe you'd
do me the honor of letting

15:12.328 --> 15:14.195
one of your comics
go on my--I mean,

15:14.230 --> 15:15.730
I know I'm not worth it, but...

15:15.764 --> 15:19.133
I would love for you to sell
<i>So Buttons</i> in Secret Stash.

15:19.167 --> 15:21.101
He made it easy for you.

15:21.136 --> 15:23.136
I mean, yeah, I-I would
like to, um sell it.

15:23.171 --> 15:25.105
That's, uh, that's amazing
I would love that.

15:25.139 --> 15:26.240
All right, sounds like a good deal?

15:26.274 --> 15:27.675
Sounds like a good deal.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.344
Think maybe that might help
on maybe bringing

15:29.378 --> 15:31.713
the price on that
<i>Giant-Size Man-Thing</i> down?

15:31.747 --> 15:33.181
What do you think for
the <i>Giant-Size Man-Thing?</i>

15:33.215 --> 15:35.283
Let's, uh, let's take a look.

15:35.317 --> 15:36.985
150?

15:37.020 --> 15:42.024
Well, 150's a little
farther away from 500,

15:42.059 --> 15:46.429
- but what if I said...250?
- Ooh.

15:46.463 --> 15:50.333
What if I said I made
this my Black Friday special?

15:50.367 --> 15:52.135
[Laughs]

15:52.169 --> 15:54.738
<i>So buttons</i> on special.

15:54.772 --> 15:57.474
200?

15:57.509 --> 15:59.009
Um...

15:59.043 --> 16:01.712
150 is the--really,
the best I can do.

16:01.746 --> 16:03.747
175?

16:06.752 --> 16:07.986
- All right, man, deal.
- Thank you.

16:08.020 --> 16:10.856
- All right.
- [Laughs]

16:10.890 --> 16:13.058
-...75, here you go.
- Perfect.

16:13.093 --> 16:14.527
- Well, thank you.
- Thank you very much.

16:14.561 --> 16:15.828
- Thanks for bringing it in.
- Appreciate it.

16:15.863 --> 16:16.829
And, uh, here's a card.

16:16.864 --> 16:18.131
Give us a call from time to time

16:18.165 --> 16:19.633
- and we should restock--
- Check in on <i>So Buttons.</i>

16:19.667 --> 16:22.002
On <i>So Buttons</i> and I think your
thing is gonna do well here.

16:22.036 --> 16:23.270
- It's a great looking book.
- Thanks a lot.

16:23.304 --> 16:24.404
See you guys.

16:24.438 --> 16:26.306
About 175 for that's not bad, right?

16:26.341 --> 16:28.108
That'll look really nice up there.

16:28.143 --> 16:29.777
Mike, by the way, you're off next week

16:29.811 --> 16:31.646
with no pay since he bought that.

16:31.680 --> 16:33.681
You earned it.

16:36.219 --> 16:38.186
When was the last time you played?

16:38.221 --> 16:39.621
A year and a half ago.

16:39.656 --> 16:41.457
I--I'd--I'm--I think
I'll make it about

16:41.491 --> 16:43.458
10 minutes before I pull
up the mask and do a...

16:43.493 --> 16:45.260
[Imitates retching]
Projectile vomit...

16:45.294 --> 16:47.195
And then get back into the game.

16:47.230 --> 16:49.497
Big, how long are you gonna
make it before you vomit?

16:49.532 --> 16:53.000
I've already thrown up twice
so far on the way here.

16:53.035 --> 16:56.236
McCutchen, Clownface is in goal.

16:56.271 --> 16:57.838
Like, they wouldn't let
that play in the NHL.

16:57.872 --> 17:00.473
- Puffy hair coming out the sides.
- Yeah.

17:00.508 --> 17:02.274
It's one thing to paint a
mask, it's another thing

17:02.309 --> 17:03.742
to put on accoutrements and whatnot.

17:03.777 --> 17:06.645
He's accessorizing.
[All laugh]

17:06.679 --> 17:09.381
Last time I faced McCutchen, he
took a penalty shot against me

17:09.415 --> 17:12.017
as a goalie; Rushed
at me wearing pads.

17:12.050 --> 17:13.419
Yes, the penalty shot.

17:13.453 --> 17:15.587
- A goalie-on-goalie penalty shot.
- Goalie-on-goalie penalty shot.

17:15.622 --> 17:17.955
Was he shooting with
a stick or goalie stick?

17:17.991 --> 17:20.626
He had a real stick but he had
the big leg pads on, so--

17:20.660 --> 17:23.228
He was running at me with
these pads with his big leggings

17:23.262 --> 17:25.830
and so, I'm like, I have
to--if I don't block this,

17:25.866 --> 17:27.599
I look like the worst
goalie in the world

17:27.634 --> 17:29.501
because the goalie
is scoring on the goalie.

17:29.536 --> 17:31.103
And thankfully,
I caught a piece of it.

17:31.137 --> 17:32.605
You shut him down, it was impressive.

17:32.639 --> 17:34.173
But you can't trust him

17:34.207 --> 17:35.708
'cause he could just
kind of pop out the goal

17:35.742 --> 17:36.709
and try to score on you.

17:36.743 --> 17:37.977
Which I would never do.

17:38.011 --> 17:39.578
I would never run
all the way down there.

17:39.613 --> 17:41.314
Not even if the place was on fire.

17:41.348 --> 17:42.548
You want me to hack him?

17:42.582 --> 17:43.716
Yeah, would you?

17:43.750 --> 17:45.385
- Just go out and take him out.
- Slash him.

17:45.419 --> 17:48.421
Yeah.
All right, let's do this.

17:50.057 --> 17:51.057
All right, let's get this going.

17:51.091 --> 17:53.125
Five-on-five, everybody in.

17:53.160 --> 17:54.693
Everybody in.

17:54.728 --> 17:57.229
Lady Ming, what are we gonna
do, sir; what's your plan?

17:57.263 --> 18:00.666
Our plan is to run our asses
off and to not get injured.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.167
Just giving everyone
a reminder, my nickname

18:02.202 --> 18:03.936
has been "The Sieve" for many years.

18:03.970 --> 18:05.671
Don't let any past you.

18:05.705 --> 18:06.772
You ready?
Everybody in.

18:06.807 --> 18:08.975
One, two, three.
All: Puck you!

18:09.010 --> 18:10.677
All right.

18:10.711 --> 18:12.713
Let's do this.

18:24.693 --> 18:27.094
All right, let's play hockey!

18:27.129 --> 18:29.497
[Grunts]

18:29.531 --> 18:30.497
Aw, Mike!

18:30.532 --> 18:32.166
Never to Mike!

18:32.200 --> 18:34.034
Come on, Mike!

18:34.068 --> 18:35.035
Mike, Mike, Mike!

18:35.069 --> 18:36.536
I'm open!

18:36.571 --> 18:37.704
Come on!

18:37.738 --> 18:39.139
[Groans]

18:39.173 --> 18:41.975
Come on, Flannigan!

18:42.009 --> 18:45.779
Ow.

18:45.813 --> 18:48.481
Ming!

18:48.516 --> 18:50.317
Come on, Ming, find twine!

18:50.351 --> 18:52.019
[Laughs]

18:52.053 --> 18:53.620
You got checked by a girl!

18:53.654 --> 18:55.022
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

18:55.056 --> 18:57.024
- No, nope.
- Never!

18:57.059 --> 18:59.160
Oh, man.

18:59.194 --> 19:01.196
When you were younger,
it was all about the glory

19:01.230 --> 19:04.198
of blocking something and if--if
it did take a shot in the ass

19:04.233 --> 19:06.334
and it hurt, you just
manned up and stuff.

19:06.368 --> 19:08.036
But, like, I'd see someone
come and wind up.

19:08.070 --> 19:10.772
Suddenly, I'm thinking about my
tender parts and I'm like,

19:10.806 --> 19:11.839
"This is gonna hurt
for a while."

19:11.874 --> 19:13.174
[All laugh]

19:13.209 --> 19:14.308
I didn't feel young,
I'll tell you that much.

19:14.343 --> 19:15.910
Oh...

19:15.944 --> 19:17.979
Holy [bleep], man.

19:18.013 --> 19:19.714
- What do you got here?
- The entire run of

19:19.748 --> 19:20.849
<i>Crisis on Infinite Earths.</i>

19:20.883 --> 19:22.350
- Whoa.
- You know what this one is.

19:22.384 --> 19:23.885
Death of Supergirl.

19:23.919 --> 19:24.985
You're like, "Whoo,
I'm sure they're not gonna"

19:25.020 --> 19:26.253
kill anybody else that major.

19:26.288 --> 19:27.288
But you'd be wrong.

19:33.913 --> 19:35.111
- Hey.
- Hey, how's it going, man?

19:35.231 --> 19:36.169
- Good, how are you?
- I'm all right.

19:36.305 --> 19:37.194
What do you got here?

19:37.314 --> 19:38.476
Uh, well, what we got is

19:38.596 --> 19:41.611
the entire run of <i>Crisis on</i>
<i>Infinite Earths</i>

19:41.645 --> 19:43.646
with doubles of, uh,
of the later half.

19:50.553 --> 19:51.953
Did you ever hear of this, Ming?

19:51.988 --> 19:52.954
<i>Crisis on Infinite Earths?</i>

19:52.988 --> 19:54.389
Uh, I mean, vaguely.

19:54.423 --> 19:57.459
For those that, uh, don't
know, in a nutshell,

19:57.493 --> 19:59.461
give them the
<i>Crisis on Infinite Earths.</i>

19:59.495 --> 20:01.129
It was a 12-issue series
that were--

20:01.163 --> 20:05.467
DC was going to, uh,
fold all of their worlds.

20:05.501 --> 20:09.805
DC was, uh, a company built on,
like, 12 different worlds.

20:09.839 --> 20:11.473
They called it the Multiverse.

20:11.507 --> 20:14.677
So there was, like,
an earth-a, an earth-b,

20:14.711 --> 20:16.779
an earth-2, and an earth-4.

20:16.813 --> 20:17.847
An earth-x.

20:17.881 --> 20:19.115
And on all these different earths,

20:19.149 --> 20:21.116
they could take their characters

20:21.150 --> 20:24.252
and tell stories that they
wouldn't wanna normally tell.

20:24.287 --> 20:27.221
It was a fabulous series and
the first big, major event

20:27.256 --> 20:29.256
- was in issue seven.
- Right there.

20:29.291 --> 20:30.891
- Death of Supergirl.
- Right.

20:30.925 --> 20:33.393
You get the gut-punch
with issue seven.

20:33.427 --> 20:35.228
And you're like, "All right,
whoo, let me catch my breath"

20:35.263 --> 20:37.363
till next month and I'm sure
they're not gonna kill anybody

20:37.398 --> 20:40.032
"Off that major, at least until
another couple issues."

20:40.067 --> 20:42.101
But you'd be wrong.

20:42.135 --> 20:46.272
Stop assuming because right off
the bat, next month, they

20:46.306 --> 20:48.441
- kill off the flash, Barry Allen.
- Wow.

20:48.475 --> 20:50.577
And--and he stays dead
for, like, 23 years.

20:50.611 --> 20:51.711
That's huge.

20:51.746 --> 20:54.782
To save the world,
he sacrificed his life.

20:54.816 --> 20:56.684
And to sell issues.

20:56.718 --> 20:57.685
[Laughs] Yes.

20:57.719 --> 21:00.521
To sell issues.

21:00.556 --> 21:01.956
Why you wanna sell it?

21:01.990 --> 21:03.724
Uh, I'm just trying to
make a little extra money

21:03.759 --> 21:04.725
toward a film camera.

21:04.760 --> 21:06.594
I'm trying to be a film director

21:06.628 --> 21:08.129
- and editor, um...
- Oh, neat, wow.

21:08.163 --> 21:10.865
So I'm selling off the past to
pay for the future, really.

21:10.899 --> 21:13.967
Well, that--that
sounds familiar.

21:14.002 --> 21:19.272
A comic book collector sells his
collection to fund his movie.

21:19.307 --> 21:20.273
Yeah--

21:20.307 --> 21:21.274
You ever heard that story before?

21:21.308 --> 21:22.642
I am a fat guy from Jersey, so...

21:22.676 --> 21:24.910
So, the dude's trying to make a movie?

21:24.945 --> 21:25.978
Said he was inspired by you.

21:26.012 --> 21:28.047
How awesome is that, man?

21:28.081 --> 21:30.983
Do you think that's,
um, harder or easier

21:31.017 --> 21:32.118
today to do what you did?

21:32.152 --> 21:33.719
Sell your collection to make a movie?

21:33.753 --> 21:35.554
I think it's--I don't
think it's easy

21:35.588 --> 21:36.922
to sell a collection anymore.

21:36.956 --> 21:38.423
But I think it's easy to make a movie.

21:38.458 --> 21:40.659
The technology is democratized.

21:40.694 --> 21:42.562
They can make cameras that
anybody can use--

21:42.596 --> 21:44.264
- Can even make a movie on this.
- Bingo.

21:44.298 --> 21:46.566
And you can edit a movie
on that and you can upload

21:46.601 --> 21:48.401
that movie to the Internet
right on the phone.

21:48.436 --> 21:51.104
Like, to make <i>Clerks,</i>
we needed to rent equipment,

21:51.139 --> 21:53.974
lights, we needed to rent a
Steenbeck to edit it.

21:54.008 --> 21:55.943
You can do all the stuff we did
right there on a phone.

21:55.977 --> 21:57.511
So it's in the hands of everybody.

21:57.545 --> 22:00.815
It's closer--in closer reach
than it's ever been before.

22:00.849 --> 22:02.549
Problem is, with so
many people doing it,

22:02.584 --> 22:04.017
it's tough to stand out.

22:04.052 --> 22:06.553
'Cause now the field is even
wider full of competition

22:06.587 --> 22:08.054
because it's open to everybody.

22:08.089 --> 22:09.522
All right, what else you got?

22:09.556 --> 22:12.558
Uh, that is a print I got
signed by Jim Lee.

22:17.998 --> 22:21.433
I got it in 2003 at
wizard world in Philly.

22:21.468 --> 22:22.868
I looked over and I was like,
"Oh, there's Jim Lee, signing."

22:22.902 --> 22:23.869
So I was like, "Let me hop on it"

22:23.904 --> 22:25.438
before the line gets
ridiculous."

22:25.472 --> 22:26.506
Yeah, that's beautiful.

22:26.540 --> 22:28.941
Jim Lee, probably today's

22:28.976 --> 22:30.677
premier Batman artist.

22:30.711 --> 22:32.513
As far as the print goes, I mean,

22:32.547 --> 22:33.814
I'm a gigantic Jim Lee fan,
I mean--

22:33.848 --> 22:35.049
He's one of the greatest--

22:35.083 --> 22:37.618
Most popular comic artist
working today.

22:37.653 --> 22:39.287
I mean, it is just a print
with his signature

22:39.321 --> 22:41.123
so it's, like,
it's not original artwork,

22:41.157 --> 22:43.926
so, um, what are you looking
for for the print?

22:43.960 --> 22:47.829
Um, I think 20 would be
a good number on that.

22:47.864 --> 22:52.434
Um...will you take 15 for it?

22:52.469 --> 22:55.738
- ...yeah, I'll take 15 for it.
- All right.

22:55.772 --> 22:57.339
What are we looking at for the <i>Crisis?</i>

22:57.373 --> 23:01.377
For the <i>Crisis</i> I'd like to get
as close to 100 as I could.

23:03.679 --> 23:05.180
Okay.

23:05.214 --> 23:10.517
I've gotta be honest, I've seen
sets go in high grade for 25.99.

23:10.552 --> 23:11.885
- In high grade, 'cause I've--
- High grade, yeah.

23:11.920 --> 23:13.553
I've seen full sets for that amount,

23:13.588 --> 23:15.188
but usually their grade is
usually around, like,

23:15.223 --> 23:16.957
a six or seven out of a ten.

23:16.991 --> 23:20.727
Like, if I sell it here, I
might be able to get 50 for it.

23:20.761 --> 23:26.933
So, um, I'm gonna
have to offer you, um...

23:26.967 --> 23:28.534
15 bucks for a set.

23:28.569 --> 23:30.669
- 15 bucks for the set?
- Yeah.

23:30.704 --> 23:33.772
If you want the 30 for--for
these two items, then, you know,

23:33.807 --> 23:36.808
we can make that happen.

23:40.512 --> 23:42.914
I think, uh, I think 30 will do.

23:42.948 --> 23:44.349
I--I'll let these go at 30.

23:44.383 --> 23:45.750
- Okay, fantastic.
- Good.

23:45.785 --> 23:47.219
That's a little bit of karma--

23:47.253 --> 23:48.587
good karma right there, man.

23:48.621 --> 23:50.355
That's you reaching back through time.

23:50.390 --> 23:53.626
If we can script it into a comic
book to an earth-2 Kev

23:53.661 --> 23:54.828
and being like, here's the money.

23:54.862 --> 23:56.797
Go chase your dream.

23:56.831 --> 24:00.034
- All that in 30 bucks?
- My mom liked that joke.

24:00.068 --> 24:02.169
He--he probably needed a
couple more books to sell

24:02.204 --> 24:03.437
before he could
start filming, but--

24:03.471 --> 24:04.471
Right, but it's a good thing.

24:04.505 --> 24:05.472
You put him on his path.

24:05.506 --> 24:07.140
We started him off.

24:07.174 --> 24:08.675
- All right, man, thanks.
- All right, thanks a lot, guys.

24:08.709 --> 24:11.544
- All right.
- Good luck.

24:11.578 --> 24:13.112
Yo, how you feeling?

24:13.146 --> 24:14.947
I have elevated heart rate.

24:14.981 --> 24:16.281
But not in that good way.

24:16.315 --> 24:17.582
- How are you feeling--
- I feel great.

24:17.616 --> 24:18.583
You look like you're dead already.

24:18.617 --> 24:19.717
You look like you blew your [Bleep]

24:19.752 --> 24:20.852
At warm-up for some reason.

24:20.886 --> 24:22.120
Running around like
a sprite out there.

24:22.154 --> 24:23.555
- I'm all right.
- You're like a teenage boy.

24:23.589 --> 24:25.891
You shot so early we got nothing left.

24:25.925 --> 24:29.328
We have 45 minutes left to kill
on the hour we paid for.

24:29.362 --> 24:32.565
At this point, you're like,
yeah, let's play a full game!

24:32.600 --> 24:34.735
And then you're like,
15-minute game.

24:34.769 --> 24:36.537
And then you're like,
ten-minute periods?

24:36.571 --> 24:39.806
Oh, I'm done.
[All laugh]

24:39.841 --> 24:42.843
- Go.
- All right, let's do a faceoff.

24:42.878 --> 24:44.678
This guy can't shoot.

24:44.712 --> 24:46.279
Aw!

24:46.314 --> 24:48.481
Come on!

24:48.515 --> 24:51.317
What the [Bleep]?!

24:51.351 --> 24:55.721
Oh [bleep].

24:55.756 --> 24:57.789
Save the day, Walt.

24:57.824 --> 24:59.124
Time out, time out.

24:59.159 --> 25:01.360
No time out, get the [Bleep] up there.

25:01.394 --> 25:03.395
Check him, Ming.

25:06.333 --> 25:09.768
- [Laughs]
- Oh, for Christ's sake.

25:09.803 --> 25:11.804
Is that it?

25:13.674 --> 25:15.108
[Groans]

25:15.142 --> 25:17.077
[Groans]

25:17.111 --> 25:18.812
Of course, uh, the spirit is always

25:18.846 --> 25:20.981
more willing than the flesh.

25:21.016 --> 25:23.685
Flesh was very weak, insanely weak.

25:23.719 --> 25:26.654
Almost nauseatingly, vomitously weak.

25:26.688 --> 25:28.189
I don't remember...

25:28.223 --> 25:31.225
Needing to sleep quite so much
when we used to play.

25:31.259 --> 25:34.161
Literally, the first step
I took made my knee buckle

25:34.196 --> 25:35.696
and I was done after that.
[Laughs]

25:35.730 --> 25:37.031
Let me see that--how
big is it?

25:37.065 --> 25:39.066
Aw, it's like a grapefruit.

25:39.100 --> 25:41.101
I got crutches at my office
if you need them.

25:41.135 --> 25:43.636
- Bengay, icyhot.
- Rascal?

25:43.670 --> 25:46.005
I'll steal one from the
grocery store for you.

25:46.039 --> 25:48.307
For a long, long time,
we didn't play hockey.

25:48.342 --> 25:49.776
And age just crept in.

25:49.810 --> 25:53.312
Yeah, I--I'm a little thicker,
a little slower.

25:53.347 --> 25:55.515
I tell you, man, I felt tired as balls

25:55.550 --> 25:58.552
and we didn't win the game by
any stretch of the imagination.

25:58.586 --> 26:01.688
But when we got to do it again
together, it was awesome.

26:01.723 --> 26:03.824
Like, suddenly,
we weren't 40 years old.

26:03.858 --> 26:06.159
It feels like we're resuming
a conversation

26:06.194 --> 26:08.729
we left off 20 years ago.

26:08.763 --> 26:10.764
You know, but always continued

26:10.798 --> 26:12.299
every time we kind of come together.

26:12.333 --> 26:14.468
So, brings you back
to where it all started.

26:14.502 --> 26:16.203
I'm ready to go another round.

26:16.238 --> 26:17.271
[Bleep] A.

26:17.306 --> 26:18.740
I never want to get up.

26:18.774 --> 26:20.842
Who's gonna open the store?

26:20.877 --> 26:22.844
Wassup!

26:22.879 --> 26:25.013
Oh, look who it is.

26:25.047 --> 26:26.280
I brought you my prized possession.

26:26.315 --> 26:29.316
- This is my lightsaber hilt.
- No way!

26:33.609 --> 26:36.444
I mean, I was a big Batgirl
fan because you like Batman

26:36.479 --> 26:39.214
and suddenly, this is everything
you love about Batman,

26:39.249 --> 26:41.283
but you can have sex with it too.

26:41.318 --> 26:44.154
[All laugh]

26:44.188 --> 26:45.588
And so suddenly, you're like,
"I love Batgirl, she's great."

26:45.623 --> 26:47.257
- Then--
- In the show?

26:47.292 --> 26:49.693
Like Barbara Gordon in the show,
or in the comics?

26:49.727 --> 26:50.962
In the comics and in the show.

26:50.996 --> 26:52.196
I liked her in the show,
but I liked her

26:52.231 --> 26:54.465
as Batgirl in the show,
not as Barbara Gordon.

26:54.500 --> 26:55.934
Whenever she got out of the
outfit and she looked like

26:55.968 --> 26:57.168
a librarian with the short hair,

26:57.202 --> 26:58.303
I was like,
"That ain't Batgirl."

26:58.337 --> 27:00.138
But when she gets shot in

27:00.172 --> 27:02.106
<i>The Killing Joke,</i>
the Alan Moore story,

27:02.140 --> 27:04.542
the joker shoots her and
shatters her spine,

27:04.576 --> 27:07.044
and so she's been in a
wheelchair ever since, right?

27:07.078 --> 27:09.312
And that made her, I think,
ever more appealing,

27:09.347 --> 27:10.613
'cause then you just wanted
to take care of her

27:10.648 --> 27:11.781
- 'cause she's in a wheelchair.
- Really?

27:11.815 --> 27:12.983
Oh, you wouldn't leave her?

27:13.017 --> 27:14.685
No--what?!

27:14.719 --> 27:17.321
Yeah, I'm like, "You're no good to me."

27:17.355 --> 27:18.522
"You've been shot.

27:18.556 --> 27:19.823
Below the waist,
you're dead."

27:19.858 --> 27:22.726
Any girl I'm with feels
nothing below the waist.

27:34.438 --> 27:35.174
Comics.

27:35.294 --> 27:37.540
How's the stocking of
the shirts coming, Ming?

27:37.574 --> 27:40.543
Uh, could be doing better;
We've got a lot left here.

27:40.577 --> 27:42.144
Wassup!

27:42.179 --> 27:44.614
Oh, look who it is.

27:44.648 --> 27:46.082
- How you doing, Jay?
- How you guys doing?

27:46.116 --> 27:47.283
What are you doing in town?

27:47.317 --> 27:48.518
You know what I'm doing in town, man.

27:48.552 --> 27:49.585
Kevin asked me to come in

27:49.620 --> 27:50.887
and check things out, so--

27:50.921 --> 27:51.887
- What does that mean?
- I wanted to come in and--

27:51.922 --> 27:52.888
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:52.923 --> 27:54.023
What are you talking about?

27:54.057 --> 28:00.897
He wants to see how things are
going, bro.

28:00.931 --> 28:02.365
Uh, did I hear this right?

28:02.399 --> 28:06.503
Mewes came to visit and, like,
worked at the Stash for a day?

28:06.537 --> 28:10.874
He told me you told him to
come down and work at the Stash.

28:10.908 --> 28:12.809
That--doesn't that sound
a little sit-com to you?

28:12.843 --> 28:14.377
I'm like, "Your punishment
is you gotta"

28:14.412 --> 28:16.380
go work at
the Stash, young man."

28:16.414 --> 28:17.547
And he's like, "Aw!"

28:17.582 --> 28:19.350
See him fly across the country
in graphic--

28:19.384 --> 28:21.085
[all laugh]

28:21.119 --> 28:24.255
What new books
are--are here today?

28:24.289 --> 28:26.257
Ming, he is not getting
those books for free.

28:26.291 --> 28:28.725
I don't care what you've gotta
do or what you have to say.

28:28.760 --> 28:31.194
You cannot let him walk out
of here with those books.

28:31.229 --> 28:32.763
All right, full price.

28:32.797 --> 28:35.366
Give him a discount,
you heartless bastard.

28:35.400 --> 28:36.834
I know, his name's on the store.

28:36.868 --> 28:39.469
I'm gonna take these
and then I'm gonna come back

28:39.503 --> 28:40.870
when the new books get here.

28:40.905 --> 28:42.372
All right, I'm gonna
let Ming handle this.

28:42.406 --> 28:43.439
And I need to get a shirt.

28:43.474 --> 28:45.074
I spilled something on my shirt.

28:45.108 --> 28:47.677
It's a little chilly out so I'm
probably gonna take a hoodie.

28:47.711 --> 28:50.446
That's cool, Ming'll take care of you.

28:50.481 --> 28:52.215
You know this was my idea to
make hoodies, right?

28:52.250 --> 28:53.617
He invented the hoodie.

28:53.651 --> 28:55.919
You know, one day,
I was like, my head is cold.

28:55.953 --> 28:58.088
I wish there was a shirt
with a hood on it.

28:58.122 --> 29:00.690
No, no, I didn't invent
the hoodies but...

29:00.725 --> 29:01.958
- All right, is this it?
- Wait, why are you--

29:01.993 --> 29:03.160
why are you ringing this up, bro?

29:03.194 --> 29:04.695
What do you mean,
why am I ringing it in?

29:04.729 --> 29:06.530
'Cause that--wait,
I'm not gonna pay for these.

29:06.564 --> 29:07.865
Well put them back if you're
not gonna pay for them.

29:07.899 --> 29:09.099
- What do you mean?
- You've gotta pay for them.

29:09.134 --> 29:10.367
- Wait a sec.
- I'll give you a discount.

29:10.402 --> 29:11.969
- Turn around and look at him.
- Okay.

29:12.003 --> 29:13.603
What's on his chest.

29:13.638 --> 29:15.005
- Oh, the--your face?
- Yeah.

29:15.039 --> 29:16.974
Yeah, but it's not--you really
think that, like, um--

29:17.008 --> 29:19.475
Like, Orville Redenbacher
walks into a food store

29:19.510 --> 29:21.310
and he's like,
I'm gonna take this popcorn.

29:21.345 --> 29:22.745
All right, you're right.

29:22.780 --> 29:25.481
You're right, none of that
makes sense.

29:25.516 --> 29:26.482
But, yo, I'm broke.

29:26.517 --> 29:28.151
[All laugh]

29:28.185 --> 29:31.654
Yo, let me get a dollar.

29:31.689 --> 29:34.190
Jay, of course, you know from
the movies; Jay and silent Bob.

29:34.225 --> 29:36.359
But, uh, for those that don't
know, uh, Jason Mewes,

29:36.394 --> 29:39.797
the guy that plays Jay, um, you
know is the dude who kind of

29:39.831 --> 29:41.065
Peter Pan-ish, man.

29:41.099 --> 29:43.134
Like, forever young.

29:43.168 --> 29:45.570
The best way to describe Mewes is,

29:45.604 --> 29:50.909
this is what happens to Bart
Simpson when he grows up.

29:50.943 --> 29:52.510
Can you just pay for the books, Ming?

29:52.544 --> 29:54.212
Ming, just pay for the books then.

29:54.246 --> 29:57.448
Ring him in and use your card
and everything's cool, bro.

29:57.482 --> 29:59.649
Oh, use my card?

29:59.684 --> 30:01.217
Yeah.

30:01.252 --> 30:02.552
[Laughs]

30:02.586 --> 30:03.720
I'll pay you back, though.

30:03.754 --> 30:06.222
Like the ten bucks
you owe me from 1996?

30:06.256 --> 30:08.157
I'll pay you back, yeah, yeah.

30:08.191 --> 30:12.028
[All laugh]

30:12.062 --> 30:17.067
All right, it's $103.45,
there's tax.

30:17.101 --> 30:18.068
I'm gonna go take a lunch.

30:18.103 --> 30:19.370
When I get back, if you want,

30:19.404 --> 30:21.806
I'll run the front and you guys
can take a break.

30:21.840 --> 30:22.907
I wanna go with you.

30:22.941 --> 30:23.942
Let's go to lunch, dude?

30:23.976 --> 30:24.943
Do you think--

30:24.977 --> 30:25.944
do you think you could add, like,

30:25.978 --> 30:27.379
20 bucks, dude, then we can get

30:27.413 --> 30:30.215
cash from the Reggie just so I
can grab, like, some pizza?

30:30.249 --> 30:31.283
Yeah, we can do that, we can do that.

30:31.317 --> 30:32.517
Wha--no.

30:32.552 --> 30:33.919
I'll get you back, dude.

30:33.953 --> 30:36.955
- All right, all right.
- 20 bucks, that's it.

30:42.628 --> 30:44.229
He thinks of you, he's like,
"This pigeon.

30:44.263 --> 30:46.631
I can take money out
of him like he's an ATM."

30:46.665 --> 30:48.866
I still don't know how that
happened, though.

30:48.900 --> 30:50.434
How did I whip out
my credit card and--

30:50.469 --> 30:51.936
'Cause you got starstruck, dude.

30:51.970 --> 30:53.137
You see him still and you're like,

30:53.172 --> 30:55.573
"He's that boy from the movies!"
You know?

30:55.607 --> 30:57.608
And you're like, "Here's all my
money, Mr. Mewes."

30:57.642 --> 30:58.876
We're going to lunch, I'll be back.

30:58.910 --> 31:00.044
If you guys wanna take a break--

31:00.078 --> 31:01.979
Don't hurry back, take your time.

31:02.013 --> 31:03.914
What just happened?

31:03.949 --> 31:05.182
You got robbed.

31:05.216 --> 31:10.854
[Laughs]

31:10.889 --> 31:12.556
- Hey, man, how you doing?
- How you doing, buddy?

31:12.590 --> 31:13.557
Good to see you.

31:13.592 --> 31:15.126
What's the occasion?

31:15.160 --> 31:16.928
I got too much comics.

31:16.962 --> 31:18.163
My man cave's in serious jeopardy.

31:18.197 --> 31:20.265
My wife is giving me a lot of heat.

31:20.299 --> 31:22.333
Your manhole's in jeopardy?

31:22.368 --> 31:24.402
Man c--man cave.

31:24.437 --> 31:25.938
I think you lost him.

31:25.972 --> 31:28.507
Walt and I talk about--it's
where guys keep their comics.

31:28.541 --> 31:29.975
- Oh, okay.
- And their stuff.

31:30.010 --> 31:32.644
So, my wife said you gotta
go through this stuff

31:32.679 --> 31:34.914
and, you know, get rid of some of it.

31:34.948 --> 31:37.116
So you gotta get rid
of some to get some more.

31:37.150 --> 31:38.317
It's--it's like
the ongoing thing.

31:38.351 --> 31:40.285
- All right.
- What have you got there, man?

31:40.319 --> 31:45.223
Al Harvey, who created Richie
Rich, Casper, asked Steve Ditko,

31:45.257 --> 31:49.260
who co-created spider-man,
to create a 3d comic.

31:56.402 --> 31:57.402
Where'd you get this at?

31:57.436 --> 31:59.170
Uh, it was a long story.

31:59.204 --> 32:02.440
We don't have that long.
[Both laugh]

32:02.474 --> 32:05.309
When do I come here like
clockwork, ever week?

32:05.343 --> 32:06.643
- On Wednesdays.
- Wednesdays.

32:06.677 --> 32:07.744
When you put out the new books.

32:07.778 --> 32:09.613
Back in the day, books used to

32:09.647 --> 32:11.349
- come out on Friday, remember?
- Right.

32:11.383 --> 32:14.185
So on Fridays...

32:14.219 --> 32:16.587
...this guy who my friend used
to say was going through

32:16.622 --> 32:19.224
mid-life crisis and
had a suit on and...

32:19.258 --> 32:21.859
So he buys a collection
from an old lady.

32:21.894 --> 32:24.363
Her husband had a stationary store...

32:24.397 --> 32:26.131
...you spent $32 on
comics this week...

32:26.166 --> 32:28.033
...toy store this weekend
and I ran into Mike and

32:28.068 --> 32:29.401
I had my daughter and he had his...

32:29.436 --> 32:31.070
...I remember the day
my dad got an ulcer.

32:31.104 --> 32:34.206
I wanted to get the,
uh, Death Star droid--

32:34.240 --> 32:35.707
Dude, how much do you want for this?

32:35.742 --> 32:36.909
Yeah, are you trying to sell them?

32:36.943 --> 32:38.477
Or are you just coming
here to tell a story?

32:38.511 --> 32:40.012
You know, m--maybe.

32:40.046 --> 32:43.215
On the Internet, I've seen it
as high as 145.

32:43.250 --> 32:44.250
Yeah, but you know what?

32:44.284 --> 32:45.918
You, as well as I, know that

32:45.953 --> 32:48.287
there's very few people looking
for this stuff right now.

32:48.321 --> 32:50.990
Every day that this book is not sold,

32:51.024 --> 32:53.225
someone who was interested
in it, is dead.

32:53.259 --> 32:54.726
They die by the minute.

32:54.760 --> 32:57.095
A man of your capability
can move things.

32:57.129 --> 32:59.564
If not, put it in a more capable hand.

32:59.598 --> 33:01.599
Oh, there goes two more
of the potential customers

33:01.633 --> 33:03.734
have died by the time we're
having this conversation.

33:03.769 --> 33:05.836
I had a vague interest in them.

33:05.871 --> 33:07.305
I felt though, I could
get them at a price

33:07.339 --> 33:08.406
that I was comfortable with.

33:08.440 --> 33:10.675
But, unfortunately, Jay felt that

33:10.709 --> 33:13.945
it was not a price that was fair
to our regular customer.

33:13.980 --> 33:15.847
So what do you think, Walter?

33:15.882 --> 33:19.918
Uh, I'll give you 15 bucks
for <i>Captain 3-D...</i>

33:19.953 --> 33:23.022
And <i>True 3-D...</i>

33:23.056 --> 33:27.793
Yeah.

33:27.828 --> 33:30.663
50 bucks for all four of them.

33:30.697 --> 33:32.097
He starts haggling against us?

33:32.132 --> 33:33.866
He starts haggling against us.

33:33.900 --> 33:35.701
Against the family?

33:35.735 --> 33:37.670
Fredo.
[Kiss noise]

33:37.704 --> 33:39.504
He is the Fredo of this bunch, man.

33:39.539 --> 33:41.139
There's all
the new 3-d movies,

33:41.173 --> 33:42.507
so maybe it'll catch on again.

33:42.541 --> 33:44.709
This--'cause
this is 3-D from 1950.

33:44.743 --> 33:46.110
Which means it's not cutting--

33:46.144 --> 33:47.878
it's not the
state-of-the-art 3-d.

33:47.912 --> 33:50.214
I'll give you $30 for these.

33:50.248 --> 33:51.382
They're worth more than that.

33:51.416 --> 33:52.683
This is from 1952.

33:52.718 --> 33:54.219
It's about 60 years old.

33:54.253 --> 33:57.356
4o bucks for all of it.

33:57.390 --> 34:01.927
45.

34:01.961 --> 34:05.231
Um...

34:05.265 --> 34:08.634
Would you do 45 store credit?

34:08.668 --> 34:11.335
- Store credit?
- 45?

34:11.371 --> 34:15.774
- 45 it is.
- You got it.

34:15.808 --> 34:17.309
All right, thanks, guys.

34:17.342 --> 34:18.643
- All right, my man.
- See you later, bud.

34:18.677 --> 34:20.143
- Good seeing you again.
- See you on Wednesday.

34:20.178 --> 34:22.112
See you Wednesday.

34:22.147 --> 34:23.981
I probably could have
got that for a lot cheaper.

34:24.014 --> 34:25.215
This is crap.

34:25.250 --> 34:28.085
Well, I think next time,
I should negotiate.

34:28.119 --> 34:30.654
What a [bleep].

34:30.688 --> 34:32.089
That's ridiculous, man.

34:32.123 --> 34:34.425
That's why he's a danger
behind the counter.

34:34.460 --> 34:36.159
[All laugh]

34:36.194 --> 34:37.428

This is my lightsaber hilt.

34:38.964 --> 34:39.931
Do you think it's the real deal?

34:39.965 --> 34:41.766
I can tell you with about 90%

34:41.801 --> 34:43.601
surety that this, uh...

34:54.981 --> 34:56.379
The monkey comes over, he's like,

34:56.498 --> 34:58.183
"Hey, what's up, bros?"

35:18.870 --> 35:21.138
Jay...what are you doing?

35:21.173 --> 35:24.375
Uh, nothing, I'm just trying
to figure out how I could

35:24.410 --> 35:27.979
strategically set these
figures up for display.

35:28.014 --> 35:29.982
Why did you open them?

35:30.016 --> 35:31.917
So people can see
them when the come in

35:31.951 --> 35:33.418
and get to smell them and touch them.

35:33.452 --> 35:35.253
All right, don't open
any more figures, okay?

35:35.287 --> 35:37.121
Oh, I won't, this is all I need.

35:37.155 --> 35:40.090
I'll leave you back to, uh,
figuring it out, I guess.

35:40.125 --> 35:41.325
All right, yeah,
I'm gonna figure it out.

35:41.359 --> 35:42.359
Okay.

35:42.394 --> 35:44.061
Then we can put you in

35:44.095 --> 35:47.231

that doesn't work.

35:47.265 --> 35:48.265
What's all that noise back there?

35:48.299 --> 35:49.533
What's he doing?

I think he's playing
with action figures.

35:51.970 --> 35:53.571
His own action figures or?

35:53.605 --> 35:56.240
Yeah, one of the figures is him.

35:56.274 --> 35:57.342
[Laughs]

35:57.376 --> 35:58.743
The only time he slowed down

35:58.778 --> 36:01.045
even a little was when he was
playing with those toys.

36:01.080 --> 36:03.681
But, otherwise, he is
like a human pinball.

36:03.716 --> 36:06.451

you know, we're done with the--

an out-of-the-way place.

36:14.327 --> 36:15.961
Let him play with his figures.

36:15.995 --> 36:18.997

- Hey, Kevin, nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

36:31.209 --> 36:34.045
Got a call from a guy who wanted

36:34.079 --> 36:38.249
to verify if he had an
authentic <i>Star Wars</i> prop.

36:38.283 --> 36:39.684
Okay.

36:39.718 --> 36:41.953
I told him that we would never
be able to authenticate it.

36:41.987 --> 36:44.256
So I had to call in
a <i>Star Wars</i> expert.

36:44.290 --> 36:45.791
He could rock some authentication.

36:45.825 --> 36:46.792
Right.

36:46.826 --> 36:48.327
So, um, what you got here?

36:48.361 --> 36:49.962
I brought you my prized possession.

36:49.996 --> 36:51.664
- Your prized possession?
- Yep.

36:51.698 --> 36:54.700

37:03.776 --> 37:05.143
All right, can you tell
me a little bit about it?

37:05.177 --> 37:06.477
You got it at--where
was the shop?

37:06.512 --> 37:07.745
Uh, it was Ann arbor, Michigan.

37:07.779 --> 37:09.613
Uh, the owner got it from an auction

37:09.648 --> 37:12.048
and, uh, it was in the store one
day before I bought it.

37:12.083 --> 37:14.950
It's been on my shelf for,
you know, 15 years, easily.

37:14.985 --> 37:16.318
Okay, Ann arbor, Michigan.

37:16.353 --> 37:18.854
That's a far way from, uh, east
end London, but...

37:18.888 --> 37:20.255
Is that where it was made?
London?

37:20.290 --> 37:21.857
Well they were made in england
but it was filmed in London.

37:21.891 --> 37:23.192
And you say this was in <i>A New Hope?</i>

37:23.226 --> 37:25.227
Yeah, supposedly it was from
the first film, yes.

37:25.261 --> 37:27.196
I paused the movie, like,
time and time again,

37:27.230 --> 37:29.665
just staring at the bottom of
this thing to make sure I had

37:29.699 --> 37:31.467
the right amount
of rubber pieces and, like,

37:31.501 --> 37:33.068
the bottom of it looked correct,

37:33.103 --> 37:34.570
and the right bolt pattern
and everything else.

37:34.604 --> 37:37.173
Uh, the most important thing
about lightsabers is,

37:37.207 --> 37:38.741
obviously, their construction;
What the came from.

37:38.776 --> 37:41.777
They came from what was called
a grey flex flash handle.

37:41.812 --> 37:42.912
You're telling me photographers

37:42.946 --> 37:44.180
would use these things?

37:44.214 --> 37:45.715
This would be used for a
photographer, exactly.

37:45.749 --> 37:46.816
They actually held the flash.

37:46.850 --> 37:48.217
It'd be on a pole and the flash

37:48.252 --> 37:49.218
would be up here.

37:49.253 --> 37:50.220
The production team actually

37:50.254 --> 37:51.221
went out to different antique

37:51.255 --> 37:52.222
shops throughout england and

37:52.256 --> 37:53.223
started buying these things up.

37:53.258 --> 37:54.425
Basically, all the pieces in

37:54.459 --> 37:56.227
the world like this are gonna be found

37:56.261 --> 37:58.162
in a lightsaber because
Lucas went out and bought

37:58.197 --> 37:59.997
every single one of them that
they could possibly get.

38:00.032 --> 38:02.066
- And how do you know that?
- 'Cause I'm a <i>Star Wars</i> geek.

38:02.100 --> 38:03.934
[Laughs]

38:03.969 --> 38:05.636
Another key thing with lightsabers,

38:05.671 --> 38:08.139
this is called
an hp 44 computer board.

38:08.174 --> 38:10.442
This is the on and off button
for a lightsaber.

38:10.476 --> 38:12.811
And it has 13 of these little
slots--is that 13?

38:12.846 --> 38:15.414
- Yeah, lucky 13.
- So there are 13 on there.

38:15.448 --> 38:17.616
A lot of fakes have the wrong number

38:17.650 --> 38:20.418
and, uh, just getting the board
itself would be very hard.

38:20.453 --> 38:22.386
The one thing that kind of makes me

38:22.421 --> 38:24.388
doubt if it's real is its weight.

38:24.423 --> 38:26.023
It's really, really light.

38:26.057 --> 38:29.526
A lot lighter than the ones
that Mark Hamill would use.

38:29.560 --> 38:31.995
However, a lot of cases,
they would make ones

38:32.029 --> 38:33.329
where they would gut the insides,

38:33.364 --> 38:34.831
designed basically
as a stunt lightsaber.

38:34.866 --> 38:35.933
- Mm-hmm.
- Something a lot lighter.

38:35.967 --> 38:37.367
And these would be the ones that

38:37.402 --> 38:38.703
you'd see, like, Mark Hamill
running through the snow.

38:38.737 --> 38:39.871
They didn't want him to fall
on a heavy one.

38:39.905 --> 38:41.006
Right, sure.

38:41.040 --> 38:42.374
Want him to fall on a light one.

38:42.408 --> 38:44.676
What do you think; You think
it's the real deal?

38:44.711 --> 38:47.413
I can tell you this is not an
authentic lightsaber...

38:47.448 --> 38:50.316
From <i>A New Hope,</i>

38:50.351 --> 38:52.452
with about 90% surety that this
was actually used in

38:52.486 --> 38:53.453
<i>The Empire Strikes Back.</i>

38:53.487 --> 38:55.422
Really?
[Laughs]

38:55.456 --> 38:57.490
Get out of here, it was an <i> Empire?</i>

38:57.525 --> 39:00.627
- Guess who's saber.
- Gotta be Luke's.

39:00.662 --> 39:01.628
Yep, Luke's.

39:01.663 --> 39:03.030
It was...exciting.

39:03.064 --> 39:04.832
I mean, it really was
because you're seeing

39:04.866 --> 39:07.001
a prop from the original
<i>Star Wars</i> movie.

39:07.035 --> 39:08.002
That's crazy.

39:08.037 --> 39:09.003
How do you think it wound up

39:09.038 --> 39:10.405
in Ann arbor, Michigan?

39:10.439 --> 39:12.007
Like I said, this guy bought
it in an auction.

39:12.041 --> 39:14.342
Uh, it goes in the showcase,
like, one day.

39:14.377 --> 39:16.044
The guy offered to sell it
to me for, like, 60 bucks,

39:16.079 --> 39:18.213
and I said, "Sold," then and
there on the spot, so...

39:18.247 --> 39:19.715
- You bought this for 60 bucks?
- Yeah.

39:19.749 --> 39:25.755
How much is it worth?

39:27.391 --> 39:32.095
Uh, it looks pretty aged...

39:32.129 --> 39:34.097
Over seven grand.

39:34.131 --> 39:36.233
[Laughs]

39:36.267 --> 39:37.467
Easily.

39:37.502 --> 39:40.103
You know, I could double that
60 that you spent.

39:40.138 --> 39:42.773
- I'll triple it, 180.
- [Laughs]

39:42.807 --> 39:44.641
That's a pretty good return
on an investment.

39:44.676 --> 39:46.911
I'll still have to pass.

39:46.945 --> 39:48.012
All right, well,
good meeting you, man.

39:48.047 --> 39:49.147
But you'll know where it is

39:49.181 --> 39:51.383
if you guys ever change your minds.

39:51.417 --> 39:53.618
Ooh, I like that.

39:53.652 --> 39:55.620
Rock on!

39:55.654 --> 39:56.787
Teh-tah!

39:56.822 --> 39:57.889
Yeah, yeah!

39:57.923 --> 40:00.492
Sesayisin!
Hip, hip, toogen!

40:00.526 --> 40:02.928
This is the longest day that
I could remember in a while.

40:02.962 --> 40:04.696
Why was it long for you?

40:04.731 --> 40:06.331
'Cause he needs to figure out
how he's gonna tell his wife

40:06.365 --> 40:08.700
he let Mewes put hundreds of
dollars on his credit card.

40:08.734 --> 40:10.669
'Cause you know he used it again
a couple of times, right?

40:10.703 --> 40:11.770
What?

40:11.804 --> 40:13.839
Yeah, he just looked at the receipt.

40:13.873 --> 40:15.173
He looked at the receipt and just

40:15.208 --> 40:17.042
wrote the n--like, punched
the number in manually.

40:17.076 --> 40:19.811
He said he's gonna
pay you back, though.

40:19.846 --> 40:20.812
If he says he's gonna pay me back,

40:20.847 --> 40:21.980
he's gonna pay me back, right?

40:22.015 --> 40:23.615
Of course.

40:23.650 --> 40:26.652
Optimism beyond that of a normal man.

40:29.255 --> 40:31.023
Hey, guys, can I grab that
stuff? I gotta get out of here.

40:31.057 --> 40:32.024
You're leaving?

40:32.058 --> 40:33.225
Yeah, yeah, I'm out of here.

40:33.259 --> 40:34.226
All right, all right.

40:34.260 --> 40:35.460
He's taking a half day.

40:35.495 --> 40:37.429
- Wow.
- Thank you very much.

40:37.463 --> 40:38.563
Thanks for stopping by, man.

40:38.598 --> 40:39.564
You did a great job, man.

40:39.598 --> 40:40.798
You have nothing to worry about.

40:40.833 --> 40:42.734
I'm gonna talk to Kevin.
You guys did great.

40:42.768 --> 40:43.901
Don't worry, guys.
Have a good one.

40:43.936 --> 40:45.937
Wait, wait.
When do I get my money back?

40:45.971 --> 40:48.273
- It's really good to see you.
- Hey!

40:48.308 --> 40:49.408
Don't worry about your money.

40:49.442 --> 40:50.542
Let's just be thankful

40:50.576 --> 40:53.845
that hurricane Mewes
has just gone off coast.

40:53.880 --> 40:56.114
Hurricane Mewes came in,

40:56.149 --> 40:59.785
picked up your money, and took off.

40:59.819 --> 41:01.420
Just like Halley's comet,
it comes around

41:01.455 --> 41:03.589
once every six years
and you just gotta

41:03.624 --> 41:05.591
pray that the comet
don't hit your house.

41:05.626 --> 41:09.061
So, ultimately you never
found out why he was here?

41:09.096 --> 41:10.363
Never did find out.

41:10.397 --> 41:13.166
We can get to the bottom of
this mystery right now.

41:13.200 --> 41:16.803
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome a very special guest.

41:16.837 --> 41:18.571
Jason Mewes.

41:18.605 --> 41:22.341
[Gibberish]

41:22.376 --> 41:24.543
[All laugh]

41:24.577 --> 41:26.345
Jason Mewes, Jay to my silent Bob,

41:26.380 --> 41:29.214
you gotta tell me, dude,
why were you here?

41:29.249 --> 41:30.516
You were talking about it.

41:30.550 --> 41:31.583
You were like, "Oh, I wonder
how things are going."

41:31.618 --> 41:32.718
"I really wish I could be there

41:32.752 --> 41:34.553
to see how things
are set up and going."

41:34.587 --> 41:35.987
Then you inferred that you

41:36.022 --> 41:40.158
should fly six hours across the
continent; Almost 3,000 miles,

41:40.192 --> 41:41.293
because I was going like,
"I wonder what's

41:41.327 --> 41:42.594
going on in the store
right now?"

41:42.628 --> 41:44.930
Well, yeah, I mean, I thought
we had this sort of--

41:44.964 --> 41:46.498
Fair enough, man.

41:46.532 --> 41:49.034
You think there's a budget in
the store for me to get, like,

41:49.068 --> 41:50.469
a little apartment
or something next door?

41:50.503 --> 41:52.237
We can convert--
