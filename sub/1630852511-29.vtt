34:38.293 --> 34:39.659

so here I am.

34:58.147 --> 35:00.147
I watch, in the morning,

35:00.215 --> 35:03.984

all their kids come out,

35:08.524 --> 35:10.123

35:21.136 --> 35:23.436

to travel, and to get out,

35:23.505 --> 35:25.238
and to live in cities

35:34.082 --> 35:36.583

never thought I would love it.

35:39.288 --> 35:40.720
No, seriously, I want to know.

like, five minutes away.

35:49.765 --> 35:51.264
You don't have to be like,
"Oh, we're going to the city

35:51.333 --> 35:53.200
tonight," and you have to drive
an hour and a half, you know?

35:53.268 --> 35:54.367

think of these things.

36:01.910 --> 36:03.410
