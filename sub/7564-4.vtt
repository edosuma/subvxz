WEBVTT

00:08.260 --> 00:10.958
Well, Leroy, what do you see?

00:10.960 --> 00:15.278
You, rubbing your hands together
like some old money grabber.

00:15.280 --> 00:17.998
Less of the "old".

00:18.000 --> 00:19.798
Anyway, rubbing your hands together

00:19.800 --> 00:24.038
is a grocer's ancient
spiritual practice.

00:24.040 --> 00:25.838
Spiritual?

00:25.840 --> 00:29.198
Yes, it's the small shopkeeper's
form of yoga.

00:29.200 --> 00:32.958
I learnt that from
the "ma-ma-ma" master.

00:32.960 --> 00:36.958
You know, there are some experts
who can rub their way

00:36.960 --> 00:40.240
to a transcendental state
of pure avarice.

00:41.360 --> 00:42.518
Ooh!

00:42.520 --> 00:44.998
- Don't you have to sit cross-legged?
- Mm?
- Mm?

00:45.000 --> 00:46.198
Oh, yes, sometimes -

00:46.200 --> 00:48.680
as long as you're not near
the bacon slicer.

01:08.080 --> 01:09.480
HE SNIFFS

01:19.280 --> 01:20.918
Wait for it, will you?

01:20.920 --> 01:22.038
BELL CHIMES

01:22.040 --> 01:23.918
Oh!

01:23.920 --> 01:25.718
You're early, Mr Newbold.

01:25.720 --> 01:29.518
Oh, you have to be,
if you want to get here on your own,

01:29.520 --> 01:31.238
unaccompanied...

01:31.240 --> 01:33.038
free.
- Heh!

01:33.040 --> 01:34.998
How is Mrs Featherstone?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.718
Relentless.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.318
Oh, dear.

01:38.320 --> 01:41.598
Yes, anyway, er, would you
excuse us for just a moment, sir?

01:41.600 --> 01:43.158
Come here, you.

01:43.160 --> 01:47.918
- Take your time, I'm enjoying
the lack of companionship.
- Yes.

01:47.920 --> 01:51.958
Now, listen, what is your opinion
of Mrs Featherstone?

01:51.960 --> 01:53.278
Frightening.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.558
Mm, yes, agreed.

01:54.560 --> 01:59.318
But don't you think that she'd make
a perfect partner for Mr Newbold?

01:59.320 --> 02:00.678
Why do you care?

02:00.680 --> 02:02.598
Well, because whenever
Mrs Featherstone

02:02.600 --> 02:05.998
hasn't got a man in tow,
she looks hungrily at me.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.638
Ah!

02:08.639 --> 02:12.718
May I be the first to wish
you both every happiness?

02:12.720 --> 02:14.038
Thank you.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.800
Oh! Jeez.

02:18.760 --> 02:21.438
Now, what can I
help you with, er, Mr Newbold?

02:21.440 --> 02:23.078
I think I'm beyond help.

02:23.080 --> 02:25.598
Oh, really?
We've got some nice kippers.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.398
She doesn't like kippers.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.998
- What about you?
- Oh, she likes me,
that's the problem.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.438
You lucky devil.

02:33.440 --> 02:38.278
I have seen men crawling across
that doorway on their hands and knees

02:38.280 --> 02:42.078
broken in spirit
because she has rejected them.

02:42.080 --> 02:44.320
I missed that. Must've been out.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.798
Well, if one comes in again,
broken in spirit,

02:48.800 --> 02:51.358
ask him how he managed it.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.438
Now, Mr Newbold, don't be hasty,

02:53.440 --> 02:56.998
I know that she no longer is
a professional wrestler...

02:57.000 --> 02:58.040
What?

02:59.040 --> 03:02.278
She no longer wrestles
professionally -

03:02.280 --> 03:04.878
but she would keep you safe,
Mr Newbold.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.998
A sound woman in so many ways.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.478
Mostly in my way.

03:08.480 --> 03:12.878
Yeah, well, she runs a neat ship -
housekeeper of the year 2004,

03:12.880 --> 03:15.078
her place is spotless.

03:15.080 --> 03:16.158
No wonder.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.640
She's never in it -
she's always in mine.

03:19.720 --> 03:21.998
Oh! Mr Newbold, kippers...

03:22.000 --> 03:24.438
Your... I've got some very nice...

03:24.440 --> 03:26.358
Damn.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.838
"No longer wrestles professionally"?

03:28.840 --> 03:30.958
Hmm? You get worse, you do.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.358
Oh...

03:33.360 --> 03:35.080
He got away.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.558
BELL CHIMES

03:40.560 --> 03:42.320
Delivery.

03:43.520 --> 03:44.558
Where do you want it?

03:44.560 --> 03:46.318
Oh, just drop it here.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.440
CRASH

03:50.000 --> 03:51.718
One item. Sign here.

03:51.720 --> 03:55.438
Can we accept the possibility
that the contents might be damaged?

03:55.440 --> 03:56.998
Why should they be damaged?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.278
Guess.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.558
- You want me to lift it?
- Mm.

03:59.560 --> 04:01.478
With my back? A thing that size?!

04:01.480 --> 04:02.838
HE LAUGHS

04:02.840 --> 04:04.158
No.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.560
- I shall sign it unexamined, hmm?
- Mm.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.278
You don't walk like
you've got a bad back.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.238
I fight through the pain, don't I?

04:14.240 --> 04:15.880
Until it gets too much for me.

04:18.160 --> 04:19.560
Agh...!

04:28.360 --> 04:30.878
Hullo! What's this, then?

04:30.880 --> 04:32.198
It's your lucky dip.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.758
It's that mystery lot you bought,
sight unseen.

04:34.760 --> 04:39.160
Guaranteed to contain items
worth more than I paid for it.

04:40.240 --> 04:43.158
You know, that Madge...

04:43.160 --> 04:47.518
she desperately need
the comfort of a man in her life.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.638
Well, there's Gastric.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.318
He could be a comfort in your life,

04:51.320 --> 04:53.958
providing you've got
a tail you can wag.
- Mm.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.878
I think Madge has got a tail...

04:56.880 --> 04:58.800
and it's forked.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.438
He's no experience with women.

05:03.440 --> 05:04.758
He was married.

05:04.760 --> 05:06.640
She left him on their honeymoon.

05:07.760 --> 05:09.520
Not till midweek.

05:12.280 --> 05:15.358
He's a warm-hearted,
decent human being -

05:15.360 --> 05:16.718
internally.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.038
The outside needs a bit of work.

05:19.040 --> 05:22.078
Well, who else is
good-hearted enough -

05:22.080 --> 05:25.240
or should I say, daft enough -
to tackle her?

05:26.680 --> 05:31.598
I was thinking that I might organise
the four of us on a... on a date.

05:31.600 --> 05:34.078
- You're not getting me out on a...!
- No, not you!

05:34.080 --> 05:35.598
Not you and me.

05:35.600 --> 05:36.640
- What...?!
- No!

05:38.000 --> 05:41.878
I meant me and Mavis
and Gastric and Madge.

05:41.880 --> 05:43.598
- Oh!
- Mm.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.558
Madge'll never go for that.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.278
But what if it were a blind date

05:47.280 --> 05:49.158
and she wouldn't know
who were coming?

05:49.160 --> 05:51.118
- Oh!
- Mm!

05:51.120 --> 05:53.838
Now, that is sneaky.

05:53.840 --> 05:57.558
Just one of the weapons
in a small shopkeeper's armoury.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.840
HE CHUCKLES Eh?

06:03.800 --> 06:05.320
Oh...

06:08.280 --> 06:10.238
I've been up half the night with...

06:10.240 --> 06:11.718
Gastric, you're just the man.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.358
...an upset stomach.

06:14.360 --> 06:15.918
I must've eaten something.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.920
Eaten something?!
You eat everything.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.198
Rubbish.

06:20.200 --> 06:22.678
Oh, we have that for lunch.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.438
Right, now...

06:24.440 --> 06:26.518
I want you to blow in that,

06:26.520 --> 06:29.398
blow it up and then pinch it
by the neck.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.878
Could I ask what for?

06:30.880 --> 06:32.558
Look, save your breath for blowing.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.520
Just, er, blow it up - just do it.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.958
- Ugh...
- Good. Right.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.358
What's all this about?

06:55.360 --> 06:57.038
Yeah, I was wondering that.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.358
Ah, thank you.

06:58.360 --> 06:59.718
Diagnosis.

06:59.720 --> 07:04.080
We're going to find out what is wrong
with Gastric's digestive system.

07:05.840 --> 07:07.118
With a balloon?

07:07.120 --> 07:09.398
This is more than
a balloon now, ain't it?

07:09.400 --> 07:11.398
It's got you inside it.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.638
It's got all your molecules,
your DNA -

07:13.640 --> 07:17.558
it can even tell what
you had for supper last night,

07:17.560 --> 07:20.238
all we've got to do
is to listen to it.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.918
Listen to what?

07:21.920 --> 07:24.800
To you coming out of the balloon.

07:26.760 --> 07:29.160
You don't want to be trapped
in there all day, do you?

07:30.360 --> 07:32.558
Now, wait a minute...

07:32.560 --> 07:34.878
Don't fight it, Gastric.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.958
It's bigger than the both of us.

07:36.960 --> 07:39.958
Look, just-just be quiet, will you?

07:39.960 --> 07:43.278
Listen to what it tells us
about Gastric.

07:43.280 --> 07:44.998
What can a balloon tell us about me?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.718
Everything!

07:46.720 --> 07:48.478
The ancient Egyptians,

07:48.480 --> 07:52.198
they built their entire medical
knowledge on this sort of thing.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.840
The ancient Egyptians had balloons?

07:57.160 --> 07:59.640
Mainly for, er, birthdays
and stag nights.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.278
No, they did not -

08:04.280 --> 08:07.838
they had bladders of goats
and of camels, right?

08:07.840 --> 08:10.558
Now, unless you want to wait
for a camel to come through here,

08:10.560 --> 08:11.998
can we get on?

08:12.000 --> 08:13.318
Go on, I'll give it a go.

08:13.320 --> 08:15.038
Right, quiet please.

08:15.040 --> 08:17.200
It takes concentration, this.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.520
BALLOON SQUEAKS

08:28.800 --> 08:30.560
HE MIMICS SQUEAKING

08:34.919 --> 08:36.038
BALLOON SQUEAKS

08:36.039 --> 08:37.400
PFFFRT

08:40.280 --> 08:43.398
You heard that?
Obvious, ain't it, eh?

08:43.400 --> 08:44.640
You're lovesick.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.478
- Lovesick?
- Mm-hm.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.198
It's a stomach problem.

08:52.200 --> 08:55.678
Yes, well, that's where the deepest
love lies, doesn't it?

08:55.680 --> 08:58.478
Right down there
in the... in the belly.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.158
I mean, who said that?

09:00.160 --> 09:02.158
Probably William Shakespeare.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.920
Or was it Mr Arnold Smethwick
of Wolverhampton?

09:06.320 --> 09:08.118
Who am I supposed to
be in love with?

09:08.120 --> 09:10.158
Well, it's obvious -
it was Madge, wasn't it?

09:10.160 --> 09:12.198
Didn't you hear it?
Didn't you hear the balloon?

09:12.200 --> 09:16.120
When it went like that,
it went, "Maaaaadge!"

09:21.880 --> 09:25.398
I've sent Gastric home
to get his best suit on.

09:25.400 --> 09:28.718
I want him looking sharp
for his date tonight.

09:28.720 --> 09:30.518
You think Madge will turn up?

09:30.520 --> 09:32.798
Oh, yes, Madge will turn up -

09:32.800 --> 09:35.960
even if it's only just
to annoy me and Mavis.

09:38.280 --> 09:40.158
Till she sees Gastric.

09:40.160 --> 09:45.078
Supposing we hit her with
a more sophisticated, suave -

09:45.080 --> 09:49.758
dare I say, elegant -
Gastric, eh? Mm...

09:49.760 --> 09:53.478
Cos you know that ladies
like surprises, don't they?

09:53.480 --> 09:55.998
I wouldn't dare.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.678
Right, what have we got here?

09:58.680 --> 10:01.640
The Pyongyang Cosmetic Company?

10:03.840 --> 10:06.318
What the heck have you bought?

10:06.320 --> 10:10.400
"North Korea's first venture
into the beauty industry."

10:11.800 --> 10:17.318
"352 tubes of invisible lip salve
for chapped lips...

10:17.320 --> 10:19.318
"in three flavours."

10:19.320 --> 10:21.518
Yeah, well, that's good -
choice, choice, three...

10:21.520 --> 10:23.358
what are the flavours?

10:23.360 --> 10:25.920
"Peasant flags unfurling"...

10:27.240 --> 10:29.198
Yes, yes, good.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.360
"Death to capitalism"...

10:33.840 --> 10:35.640
...and "the east is cerise".

10:37.240 --> 10:39.358
Well, that's catchy.
HE CHUCKLES

10:39.360 --> 10:42.718
Well, forget the flavours
and concentrate on the product, hey?

10:42.720 --> 10:46.478
It's not winter.
Who gets chapped lips?

10:46.480 --> 10:51.158
Well, we don't need to say that
they are FOR chapped lips, do we?

10:51.160 --> 10:53.480
- For what, then?
- Mm...

10:55.160 --> 10:57.120
We'll think of something.

11:16.360 --> 11:17.640
Wait!

11:21.800 --> 11:23.798
What do I need with bullets?

11:23.800 --> 11:25.158
It's not a bullet.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.718
It's a love charm from North Korea.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.198
Who told you that twaddle?!

11:29.200 --> 11:31.758
At the shop.

11:31.760 --> 11:33.358
Listen, whatever your name is...

11:33.360 --> 11:34.678
Call me Mick.

11:34.680 --> 11:37.158
Take it back to North Korea.

11:37.160 --> 11:40.838
Take it personally
and ask for a refund.

11:40.840 --> 11:42.758
You've forgotten the magic,
haven't you?

11:42.760 --> 11:44.078
That...

11:44.080 --> 11:45.398
That thing we had.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.998
I squeezed your boil.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.518
If ever I got another one,
I swore I'd be back.

11:51.520 --> 11:52.958
I've retired -

11:52.960 --> 11:58.400
from nursing, from boils
and especially from dozy men.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.678
Well, at least take the flowers.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.718
What am I going to do
with the flowers?

12:03.720 --> 12:05.200
Don't tempt me.

12:10.360 --> 12:11.678
Yes.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.278
It's coming.

12:13.280 --> 12:15.718
The new image is coming.

12:15.720 --> 12:16.798
GASTRIC CHUCKLES

12:16.800 --> 12:18.758
Some way still to go.

12:18.760 --> 12:22.878
Yes, yes... but, er, you know,
you're given top marks for trying.

12:22.880 --> 12:25.278
The man is looking tastier, isn't he?

12:25.280 --> 12:29.758
Gorgeous - even charismatic
wouldn't be going too far.

12:29.760 --> 12:30.918
Oh, you think?

12:30.920 --> 12:32.198
Tell him, Leroy.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.798
Well, I think it's a good suit.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.398
It must be - look how long
he's made it last.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.958
Oh, they don't make 'em
like this any more.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.400
No! Thank goodness, no.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.598
Well, who's he when he's at home?

12:46.600 --> 12:49.278
Remind me. How did you meet him?

12:49.280 --> 12:52.798
I've told you -
he says I once squeezed his boil.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.838
Oh, that's one boy-meets-girl story

12:54.840 --> 12:57.158
that's never going to be
made into a film.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.678
I can't think what's got into him.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.438
It's called romance.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.878
You're a big tulip, our Mavis.

13:03.880 --> 13:05.838
It makes the world go round.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.878
It's all right when you're 16,

13:07.880 --> 13:10.920
but who wants a man
round your neck at our age?

13:15.400 --> 13:19.078
And where's Mr Newbold been hiding,
then? Before you spotted him.

13:19.080 --> 13:21.598
Just around the corner,
would you believe?

13:21.600 --> 13:24.838
He was there, all alone,
and nobody said a word.

13:24.840 --> 13:26.918
He still looks lonely.

13:26.920 --> 13:29.078
I bet he's known tragedy
in his life.

13:29.080 --> 13:30.920
If he hasn't, he soon will.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.478
I shall be glad to get
out of this suit.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.958
You'll be cooler
when the sun goes down.

13:39.960 --> 13:42.398
I shall be cool enough
with that Madge.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.038
She'd freeze anybody!

13:44.040 --> 13:45.878
No, no, no, no -

13:45.880 --> 13:47.838
the balloon, think of the balloon.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.558
The balloon is never wrong.

13:49.560 --> 13:52.638
Deep down inside you,
you want this woman.

13:52.640 --> 13:56.838
You want to lift her up
and you want to carry her away.

13:56.840 --> 13:58.718
It's the Tarzan thing.

13:58.720 --> 14:00.518
"Carry her away"! Where to?

14:00.520 --> 14:04.638
To where all lovers want to go -
to paradise,

14:04.640 --> 14:09.318
to that little den that you have,
you know, tucked away for her.

14:09.320 --> 14:13.400
I used to rent this static
caravan at Hornsea.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.238
Do you want a choc ice?

14:20.240 --> 14:24.118
Oh, I'd sooner have a cornet -
with a great big lickable lump.

14:24.120 --> 14:27.158
We'll, that's you all over, ain't it,
Gastric?

14:27.160 --> 14:28.478
Heh-heh-heh, hey?

14:28.480 --> 14:30.558
You're a great big lickable lump.

14:30.560 --> 14:31.598
HE CHUCKLES

14:31.600 --> 14:36.600
That is the image that we want
to give to Madge, ain't it, eh?

14:38.360 --> 14:39.958
Ohh!

14:39.960 --> 14:41.358
There we go.

14:41.360 --> 14:42.758
Oh-ho, ho!

14:42.760 --> 14:44.478
Don't get it down your suit.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.198
Oh, are you saying
I'm a messy eater?

14:46.200 --> 14:48.118
Only when you're eating.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.518
Because I want you
looking your best for Madge tonight.

14:51.520 --> 14:54.158
- Well, I've given it all I've got.
- Yes. Hah!

14:54.160 --> 14:56.598
Looks like your dog's
been giving it all he's got -

14:56.600 --> 14:59.278
look at you,
you're covered in dog hairs, look.

14:59.280 --> 15:00.758
Oh, that.

15:00.760 --> 15:03.318
I'm always covered in dogs' hairs.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.838
We have the solution -
we have the solution.

15:05.840 --> 15:08.878
This little monster here
will soon sort you out.

15:08.880 --> 15:12.878
You know, this is a combined
vacuum cleaner and hairdryer

15:12.880 --> 15:15.758
which means it sucks
as well as it blows.

15:15.760 --> 15:16.878
HE CHUCKLES

15:16.880 --> 15:18.038
Right, so...

15:18.040 --> 15:20.320
IT WHIRS
Ah! Here we go.

15:21.520 --> 15:22.878
Oh!

15:22.880 --> 15:25.238
Hey, hey, look at that!
That's working.

15:25.240 --> 15:26.518
Hey, hey, hey...

15:26.520 --> 15:28.678
SQUELCH Hey! Oh!

15:28.680 --> 15:30.840
Oh, hey!

15:33.360 --> 15:35.920
Have you seen
the power of this thing?!

15:47.400 --> 15:48.880
Oh, heck.

15:50.960 --> 15:53.358
I can't go on a date like this.

15:53.360 --> 15:54.640
I'll have to cancel.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.878
No, no, not so fast.

15:57.880 --> 16:02.040
You can't cancel. No, er...

16:03.400 --> 16:06.238
You'll wait until
you've had the benefit

16:06.240 --> 16:11.198
of the, er... Arkwright washing
and pressing service.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.758
How long we had one of those?

16:12.760 --> 16:13.998
For years.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.200
We just didn't realise
we had the equipment for it.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.720
WATER GUSHES

16:21.240 --> 16:22.918
Is Gastric in there?

16:22.920 --> 16:25.718
- Yeah.
- Lock him in, lock him in.

16:25.720 --> 16:27.480
'Oi, hey, oi!'

16:28.920 --> 16:30.958
Well, that's it, see?

16:30.960 --> 16:34.240
Gastric oughtn't to see
this professional bit.

16:40.160 --> 16:44.080
You see, to the layman it might
look like we're mishandling his suit.

16:50.880 --> 16:51.958
Yeah.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.358
Yeah, I can see that.

16:53.360 --> 16:56.518
Here you are -
c'mon, your turn. Keep it going.

16:56.520 --> 16:58.040
That's it, go on.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.278
Well, put your back into it, you...

17:02.280 --> 17:04.680
Ha-hey, go on.

17:08.960 --> 17:11.518
But we haven't got chapped lips.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.960
They've not had that much
wear and tear.

17:14.960 --> 17:17.917
No, but chapped lips in North Korean

17:17.920 --> 17:21.998
is loosely translated as
"kiss me" lips.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.518
Can you see blokes
wearing this stuff?

17:24.520 --> 17:26.958
Giving it a quick touch up
when they pass a mirror?

17:26.960 --> 17:30.558
They'll soon start getting
fidgety at the darts club.

17:30.560 --> 17:34.118
No, no, no, it's invisible -
people don't know you're wearing it.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.478
What are you saying it does,
exactly?

17:36.480 --> 17:37.720
Or even roughly?

17:39.000 --> 17:40.918
Listen, you've got to
open your minds.

17:40.920 --> 17:43.078
I'm open-minded.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.640
I like Chinese food.

17:46.520 --> 17:49.838
I like to think
I'm free of any prejudice.

17:49.840 --> 17:52.878
Except for people from Warrington...

17:52.880 --> 17:55.318
which I think is understandable.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.798
Mm, yeah.

17:56.800 --> 18:01.278
This stuff was working its magic
before there even was a Warrington.

18:01.280 --> 18:04.518
I'm inclined to like it already.

18:04.520 --> 18:06.078
I don't know how it works,

18:06.080 --> 18:11.518
but this powerful lotion
tends to draw people to your lips.

18:11.520 --> 18:12.958
I wouldn't want to be wearing it

18:12.960 --> 18:15.280
when I pass that bloke
at the Post Office.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.558
Could we narrow it down a bit?

18:18.560 --> 18:20.678
Yes - people of the opposite sex.

18:20.680 --> 18:23.438
Oh, you're moving into my sphere
of interest, now.

18:23.440 --> 18:26.038
This attracts people
that you're close to.

18:26.040 --> 18:30.518
You apply it on your lips,
and as soon as you have,

18:30.520 --> 18:33.678
your nearest and dearest
will start to pucker.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.320
She'll go...

19:01.480 --> 19:02.638
Give over!

19:02.640 --> 19:04.800
Hey, get real.

19:06.440 --> 19:10.878
Stop acting like a pair of
local yokels, you two.

19:10.880 --> 19:15.438
There's a thousand years of
oriental magic behind this stuff.

19:15.440 --> 19:18.398
They have some funny ideas,
it's true.

19:18.400 --> 19:21.398
Well, as far as I can see,
it's the same idea as us -

19:21.400 --> 19:23.758
they just go about it
in a funnier way.

19:23.760 --> 19:26.398
You see, they were
skilled in the arts of love

19:26.400 --> 19:28.478
when we were still
painting by numbers.

19:28.480 --> 19:31.278
Aye, and some of us still are.

19:31.280 --> 19:37.000
But that will change once your
partner finds that she can't resist.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.438
I'll try one.

19:44.440 --> 19:45.520
You must be barmy.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.120
Ah, go on, then, make it two.

19:57.960 --> 19:59.040
Ugh...

20:05.200 --> 20:06.718
We'll never get it dry enough!

20:06.720 --> 20:08.478
They managed in the old days.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.198
Oh - and what about pressing?

20:10.200 --> 20:11.878
That's been arranged.

20:11.880 --> 20:13.638
You're doing it.

20:13.640 --> 20:17.358
I only do a bit of ironing -
normal laundry.

20:17.360 --> 20:21.198
Well, now's your chance to move up
to the next level, ain't it?

20:21.200 --> 20:22.958
Does that come with more money?

20:22.960 --> 20:25.038
You see, Leroy, you've got to
look at it this way -

20:25.040 --> 20:28.718
one day all of this,
and that, will be yours.

20:28.720 --> 20:33.118
So, by not giving you a raise
I am building up your nest egg.

20:33.120 --> 20:37.680
So, technically, you could say
that I am working for you.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.438
Oh!

20:40.440 --> 20:43.118
All right, then -
but don't expect a raise.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.598
Oh, no.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.318
SHOUTING:
Is my suit ready yet?

20:46.320 --> 20:48.600
No, no, no -
give us a chance, will you?

20:50.040 --> 20:52.278
This is never going to get
the water out.

20:52.280 --> 20:56.000
Well, we need more intelligent
use of what's available.

21:09.640 --> 21:12.718
You know, I never did get
to finish that ice cream.

21:12.720 --> 21:15.480
- Oh, go on - help yourself.
- Oh!

21:16.480 --> 21:18.638
'What's the matter with them all?!

21:18.640 --> 21:20.038
'Something's going on.'

21:20.040 --> 21:21.400
I don't know what...

21:23.080 --> 21:24.918
I passed Cyril in the street -

21:24.920 --> 21:27.638
he looked like his lips
were going wild.

21:27.640 --> 21:28.798
Well, now, that's funny,

21:28.800 --> 21:32.118
because I've just seen Eric and he
was pushing his lips about.

21:32.120 --> 21:35.398
I thought, "I hope you're not
aiming those at me."

21:35.400 --> 21:38.598
- They look like they've been
sucking a lemon.
- Yes, but why?

21:38.600 --> 21:41.478
And not the same lemon,
one would hope.

21:41.480 --> 21:44.958
- There's some very strange things
going on in this neighbourhood.
- Mm!

21:44.960 --> 21:46.598
Sharing a lemon...

21:46.600 --> 21:49.798
not the sort of thing you should be
seen doing in the street.

21:49.800 --> 21:51.998
Ladies, what is your pleasure?

21:52.000 --> 21:56.638
Oh, well, thank you for asking,
Granville...

21:56.640 --> 21:59.080
but I think
I'll do me shopping first.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.918
Now, Granville, if Mr Newbold
comes in here on his own,

22:06.920 --> 22:08.918
turn him round and send him home.

22:08.920 --> 22:10.438
I can't do that!

22:10.440 --> 22:12.718
Of course he can't do that.

22:12.720 --> 22:15.958
I don't like him
spending unsupervised.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.478
I promised his mother
I'd look after him.

22:18.480 --> 22:20.518
You never knew his mother.

22:20.520 --> 22:22.918
Well, I would've promised,
had we met.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.118
BELL CHIMES

22:24.120 --> 22:27.758
Oh, good day, ladies.
Sugar, Granville.

22:27.760 --> 22:29.920
I'll get it, I know where it is.

22:31.440 --> 22:32.800
SHE SCREAMS

22:34.360 --> 22:35.840
Oh...

22:42.280 --> 22:43.640
He wanted an ice cream.

22:46.080 --> 22:47.960
Well, he looks cool enough to me.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.038
Are you all right, love?

22:51.040 --> 22:53.198
I hope you only got a brief glimpse.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.158
Now, in situations like this,

22:55.160 --> 22:57.878
I always think it's best
to look them straight in the eye.

22:57.880 --> 22:59.518
I'm sorry for losing it,

22:59.520 --> 23:02.358
but you don't see
many of those on your baking shelf.

23:02.360 --> 23:05.078
You just caught him
between trousers.

23:05.080 --> 23:06.360
I never touched him!

23:07.760 --> 23:11.518
That was always my policy -
unless there was a medical reason.

23:11.520 --> 23:14.758
Don't worry, he'll be fully clad
within the hour.

23:14.760 --> 23:15.998
Oh, I'm pleased to hear it -

23:16.000 --> 23:19.518
I was worried you might be
keeping him for display purposes.

23:19.520 --> 23:22.920
I'm sure there'd be little demand
for what he were advertising.

23:26.520 --> 23:27.678
Now...

23:27.680 --> 23:29.038
Oh!

23:29.040 --> 23:30.800
HE COUGHS

23:32.320 --> 23:33.958
Ooh-ah!

23:33.960 --> 23:35.638
Ah-ah...

23:35.640 --> 23:37.038
Ooh, ha, ah-ah-ah-ah!

23:37.040 --> 23:38.438
- Ooh!
- Ooh, ooh!

23:38.440 --> 23:39.720
Agh!

23:41.600 --> 23:43.278
How am I meant to press this?

23:43.280 --> 23:44.758
Perfectly.

23:44.760 --> 23:46.838
And get a move on -

23:46.840 --> 23:51.518
I've got to keep Gastric away from
this suit until it is presentable.

23:51.520 --> 23:53.798
He's going to be away a long time.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.040
BELL CHIMES

23:57.840 --> 23:59.198
Where's Gastric?

23:59.200 --> 24:01.278
Er, we're keeping him in the privy.

24:01.280 --> 24:02.838
Is that legal?

24:02.840 --> 24:05.878
No, not forever -
it's just until his suit's ready,

24:05.880 --> 24:08.198
he tends to excite the ladies.

24:08.200 --> 24:10.398
It's not working with Madge.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.158
She's still coming tonight, though?

24:12.160 --> 24:14.878
Yes - to keep an eye on you and me.

24:14.880 --> 24:17.358
Oh, right, well, it's a start.

24:17.360 --> 24:20.598
I mean, you know, if she likes
going out in a foursome.

24:20.600 --> 24:22.478
I wouldn't exactly say "likes",

24:22.480 --> 24:25.478
but she thinks it's better than you
and me going off on our own.

24:25.480 --> 24:28.798
Where does she get
these attitudes from?

24:28.800 --> 24:32.038
She's not wanted for war crimes
anywhere, is she?

24:32.040 --> 24:33.798
Nobody's perfect.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.038
No.

24:35.040 --> 24:37.438
Well, anyway, it's progress.

24:37.440 --> 24:39.318
I thought she might
back out entirely

24:39.320 --> 24:41.238
when she knew her date was Gastric.

24:41.240 --> 24:45.918
Ah, well, yes -
did I actually tell her?

24:45.920 --> 24:49.920
I intended to, but... I got busy -
you know how it is.

24:51.640 --> 24:53.078
I like your eyes.

24:53.080 --> 24:54.998
Oh, they're just eyes.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.038
Not from this side.

24:57.040 --> 24:58.880
THEY CHUCKLE

25:02.920 --> 25:04.360
BELL CHIMES

25:09.240 --> 25:10.438
Is it ready?

25:10.440 --> 25:13.758
Tell me it's ready!
There's a lot riding on that suit.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.918
Ta-da!

25:15.920 --> 25:18.758
Oh, yes, What a good job.

25:18.760 --> 25:20.598
Well, it's all in the wrist.

25:20.600 --> 25:22.358
Any good presser will tell you that.

25:22.360 --> 25:25.078
He'll be a right girlie magnet,
won't he, hey?

25:25.080 --> 25:27.078
Clean, well-pressed, smart.

25:27.080 --> 25:29.358
Got to be worth something -
even to Madge.

25:29.360 --> 25:30.758
What time you going out?

25:30.760 --> 25:32.080
When we close.

25:33.480 --> 25:35.958
Be a couple of, er,
you know...

25:35.960 --> 25:38.518
get-to-know-you drinks.
- Mm-hm.

25:38.520 --> 25:44.038
Back to their place for a bit
of... late supper, and, um...

25:44.040 --> 25:45.520
don't wait up.

25:49.360 --> 25:51.240
SPINE CRACKS Oh...!

25:57.640 --> 25:59.398
Mm...

25:59.400 --> 26:04.558
Now, the question is,
do we feed Gastric before we go?

26:04.560 --> 26:08.000
I'd hate to turn him loose
at Madge's if he's hungry.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.558
Ey-up!

26:10.560 --> 26:14.958
That North Korea, it's going
to be a big name in loving circles.

26:14.960 --> 26:16.200
Save me a dozen.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.398
Well, are you coming out, or what?

26:28.400 --> 26:30.560
That's if you've got time to wait.

26:31.800 --> 26:34.718
At that speed, he's not
your dashing lover, is he?

26:34.720 --> 26:39.600
- I expect he's being careful
not to spoil his creases.
- Mm.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.318
Oh... oh!

26:43.320 --> 26:44.678
Agh...

26:44.680 --> 26:46.678
Oh! Aah!

26:46.680 --> 26:48.078
Oh...

26:48.080 --> 26:49.678
Ngh...

26:49.680 --> 26:50.958
You've ruined his suit.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.038
Me?!

26:52.040 --> 26:55.398
That's inferior material, that is.

26:55.400 --> 26:58.438
It's got a grip
like a boa constrictor.

26:58.440 --> 27:00.438
I think supper's off...

27:00.440 --> 27:03.158
There's no room
for aught else in here.

27:03.160 --> 27:04.238
Augh!

27:04.240 --> 27:07.200
Nicely cleaned and pressed, though -
let's be fair.

27:08.360 --> 27:11.000
Wait - sit down, if it's painful.

27:13.440 --> 27:16.598
- There.
- Sitting down's not all that easy.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.118
Oh... oh...

27:18.120 --> 27:20.600
TROUSERS RIP Oh!

27:25.800 --> 27:27.640
BOTH: Oh!

27:28.960 --> 27:30.120
Oh!

27:42.040 --> 27:44.640
'It's going to be a tricky suit
to get out of.

27:45.720 --> 27:48.840
'I wonder if he'll have to
live in it forever.'

27:50.840 --> 27:52.958
Did you enjoy wrestling?

27:52.960 --> 27:56.480
You can forget that stuff
till I get a ring on this finger.

28:03.920 --> 28:07.718
'Under the circumstances,
I think I'm going to have to forget

28:07.720 --> 28:11.960
'that Gastric still owes me
for that ice cream.

28:13.880 --> 28:16.558
' "Open at the other end."

28:16.560 --> 28:18.118
'Hm!

28:18.120 --> 28:21.080
'I should've stuck that
on Gastric's trousers.'
