00:05.715 --> 00:07.783
When you work for a company

00:07.784 --> 00:09.751
as demanding as Veridian Dynamics,

00:09.752 --> 00:12.921
it's important to make time
to have a personal life.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

00:30.540 --> 00:33.442
She seemed nice.

00:33.443 --> 00:34.943
That was Nadine.

00:34.944 --> 00:37.145
Oh, good. So you know each other.

00:37.146 --> 00:39.214
Yeah, she's one of
the company's lawyers.

00:39.215 --> 00:41.283
Sorry for not introducing you.

00:41.284 --> 00:43.151
Your tongue was kinda busy,

00:43.152 --> 00:45.087
all up inside her mouth.

00:45.088 --> 00:46.621
She's amazing.

00:46.622 --> 00:48.557
It's just that we both
work such long hours,

00:48.558 --> 00:50.559
it's hard to find time to go out.

00:50.560 --> 00:52.527
So we usually meet in her office,

00:52.528 --> 00:54.596
where she has a door that closes

00:54.597 --> 00:56.998
and a closet where we
can hang our clothes

00:56.999 --> 00:59.768
so we're crisp and fresh
after we've soiled each other.

00:59.769 --> 01:04.172
The only time I've ever
been naked in this building

01:04.173 --> 01:06.241
remember when those super lice
got out and tried to colonize me?

01:06.242 --> 01:08.243
This is more fun than that.

01:13.516 --> 01:15.617
Hey there, bloopity-bloo.

01:15.618 --> 01:18.353
- Oopity-bo? - It's a nickname
I came up with for you,

01:18.354 --> 01:21.857
- right off the top of my head.
- So what made you get high before work this morning?

01:21.858 --> 01:23.325
I'm high on life, Ted.

01:23.326 --> 01:25.994
You know how I've been trying
to write children's books?

01:25.995 --> 01:29.131
- I just sold one.
- Really? Well, congratulations.

01:29.132 --> 01:30.465
I sent a chapter

01:30.466 --> 01:32.968
to a bunch of publishers,
and one of them bought it.

01:32.969 --> 01:35.237
I may have a whole new
career entertaining children

01:35.238 --> 01:37.439
instead of working for a place that
uses them to assemble munitions.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.841
Boy, who's gonna judge
us when you're gone?

01:39.842 --> 01:41.543
No, but really, that... that's great.

01:41.544 --> 01:43.011
So is this the story

01:43.012 --> 01:45.881
with the little forest
creature who looks like Phil?

01:45.882 --> 01:48.617
He's a lemur. And he doesn't
look anything like Phil.

01:48.618 --> 01:50.619
Their markings are completely different.

01:50.620 --> 01:52.254
Hey, guys.

01:54.190 --> 02:00.495
Ooh, bananas! I love bananas.

02:00.496 --> 02:01.930
Oh, God.

02:01.931 --> 02:04.900
I stuck a tail on Phil
and put him in a tree.

02:04.901 --> 02:06.368
He's gonna hate that.

02:06.369 --> 02:08.804
Oh, go talk to him. Maybe he'll like it.

02:08.805 --> 02:11.606
But if he shows his teeth,
I'd get the hell outta there.

02:11.607 --> 02:13.809
Oh.

02:13.810 --> 02:16.144
We all need a life outside of work.

02:16.145 --> 02:18.280
Mine is compressed into one perfect,

02:18.281 --> 02:19.714
conveniently sized bundle.

02:19.715 --> 02:21.817
Daddy!

02:21.818 --> 02:24.986
Hey, come here. Oh.
How's your day, sweetie?

02:24.987 --> 02:26.521
Awesome. Cammy threw up,

02:26.522 --> 02:29.724
and then Aaron Oberlander
slipped in it, and then...

02:29.725 --> 02:31.226
Grace T. hit Grace H.,

02:31.227 --> 02:33.228
and then Grace S. put
gum in Grace T's hair.

02:33.229 --> 02:35.630
And then there were
crying Graces everywhere...

02:35.631 --> 02:37.966
What's great about having
Rose in after-care at work

02:37.967 --> 02:40.635
is we see more of each other.

02:40.636 --> 02:43.638
The downside is, I hear
a lot of boring stories

02:43.639 --> 02:46.641
- about the children of my coworkers.
- And then grace told me that Billy's dad is getting fired.

02:46.642 --> 02:48.477
His name is Larry Pancake.

02:48.478 --> 02:50.545
Honey, there's nobody at the company

02:50.546 --> 02:53.048
named Larry Pancake or
anybody else named after food.

02:53.049 --> 02:54.983
What about Taco Tony in the cafeteria?

02:54.984 --> 02:56.918
Well, that was just a nickname,

02:56.919 --> 02:58.987
and we don't call him that anymore.

02:58.988 --> 03:02.491
When he moved to the salad
bar, it just sounded racist.

03:02.492 --> 03:06.228
The company has started
another round of downsizing.

03:06.229 --> 03:08.463
There's blood on the
cheap, industrial carpets.

03:08.464 --> 03:10.398
Some guy in Pete's R&D department

03:10.399 --> 03:11.967
just got laid off.

03:11.968 --> 03:14.302
Really? His name wasn't
Larry Pancake, was it?

03:14.303 --> 03:15.804
That's racist, Ted.

03:15.805 --> 03:18.807
Legal says we can't make fun
of people's names anymore,

03:18.808 --> 03:20.342
even if it's hilarious.

03:20.343 --> 03:22.644
The guy's name was Larry Pancow.

03:22.645 --> 03:24.179
Larry Pancow?

03:24.180 --> 03:26.448
Yesterday in after-care, Rose heard

03:26.449 --> 03:29.317
that someone named Larry
Pancake was gonna lose his job.

03:29.318 --> 03:31.586
She knew? How could she
have known ahead of time

03:31.587 --> 03:34.422
- something that confidential?
- One of the kids was talking about it.

03:34.423 --> 03:37.325
If Rose could tell us
who's about to be laid off,

03:37.326 --> 03:38.994
we could save their jobs.

03:38.995 --> 03:41.062
Being fired around here is not pretty.

03:41.063 --> 03:43.632
Veronica did have a point.

03:43.633 --> 03:45.634
When H.R. decides it wants
somebody terminated...

03:45.635 --> 03:48.236
We're go on Larry Pancow.

03:48.237 --> 03:50.906
The extraction team swings into action,

03:50.907 --> 03:53.308
descending on the unwitting
employee before he or she

03:53.309 --> 03:55.310
can remove any sensitive information

03:55.311 --> 03:57.579
worth millions to our competitors.

04:00.716 --> 04:02.951
Larry Pancow.

04:13.329 --> 04:15.363
When they lay people
off in my department

04:15.364 --> 04:17.699
it makes me look weak, like
my people are expendable.

04:17.700 --> 04:20.235
Come on, Ted. You're a people person.

04:20.236 --> 04:22.571
Th Rose's help, we could save people.

04:22.572 --> 04:25.774
Isn't that the kind of
thing you "people" people do?

04:25.775 --> 04:27.676
Okay.

04:27.677 --> 04:29.878
There are a lot of good peop here,

04:29.879 --> 04:31.880
and I'd like to save their jobs.

04:31.881 --> 04:34.583
We can have one conversation with Rose.

04:34.584 --> 04:35.650
Gently.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.118
Fine.

04:37.119 --> 04:40.021
Let's get her up here, crack
her open like a lobster claw

04:40.022 --> 04:43.358
and scoop out her sweet
white meat of information.

04:43.359 --> 04:45.994
- Gently.
- I know you don't like to eat children,

04:45.995 --> 04:46.711
but it's that kind of talk

04:46.711 --> 04:48.712
and your cottage in
the woods made of cCandy

04:48.712 --> 04:50.838
that keeps those rumors alive.

04:55.717 --> 04:58.185
My paycheck is a little light this week.

04:58.186 --> 05:01.121
- Is yours?
- I never open it before I give it to my wife.

05:01.122 --> 05:03.891
She doesn't like me
snooping into our finances.

05:03.892 --> 05:05.292
Hey, guys.

05:05.293 --> 05:07.828
- I sold one of my children's books. Yay.
- Congratulations.

05:07.829 --> 05:08.198
That's great.

05:08.199 --> 05:10.711
And the coolest part
is, it has a character

05:10.732 --> 05:13.033
that doesn't look like
anyone you've ever seen.

05:13.034 --> 05:14.635
Don't you agree?

05:14.636 --> 05:17.237
And wouldn't it be fun to
sign a release to that effect?

05:17.238 --> 05:18.806
Oh, my God. It's me.

05:18.807 --> 05:21.342
- It's not you, you egomaniac.
- I love it.

05:21.343 --> 05:24.445
Okay, it's you. See, lem? I told
you I'd look good with a tail.

05:24.446 --> 05:27.381
Not as good as I'd look with antlers.

05:27.382 --> 05:29.350
Of course, I'd have to
cut the top off my car,

05:29.351 --> 05:32.186
- but it would be totally worth it, even in a rain.
- You better make sure

05:32.187 --> 05:34.688
- the company doesn't find out about your book.
-Yeah, our employment contracts

05:34.689 --> 05:36.156
say that anything we create

05:36.157 --> 05:37.925
automatically belongs to Veridian.

05:37.926 --> 05:39.960
But I thought that just
meant, like, science-y stuff.

05:39.961 --> 05:42.062
Anything we create... science,

05:42.063 --> 05:44.465
literature, poetry, a mournful ballad.

05:44.466 --> 05:47.267
Even a hearty fish chowder I
brought to a company picnic.

05:47.268 --> 05:49.303
Verian sold the recipe to the F.A.A.

05:49.304 --> 05:51.238
Now they use it to spray down a tarmac

05:51.239 --> 05:53.340
when a plane's coming
in for a hard landing.

05:53.341 --> 05:55.843
I was gonna work on it while I was here

05:55.844 --> 05:57.878
because I'm under a
really tight deadline,

05:57.879 --> 06:00.681
but I can't risk the company
taking it away from me.

06:00.682 --> 06:02.383
What am I gonna do?

06:05.053 --> 06:08.522
You guys are thinking about
antlers and tails, aren't you?

06:08.523 --> 06:11.325
Why do animals get all the best
stuff attached to their bodies?

06:11.326 --> 06:14.628
I would love to have a blowhole.

06:14.629 --> 06:17.731
So tasha threw hamster poo at Molly,

06:17.732 --> 06:20.834
and she started crying because
some of it got on her grapes.

06:20.835 --> 06:22.803
And grapes are Molly's
ninth favorite fruit,

06:22.804 --> 06:27.207
after peaches... pears... mangoes...

06:27.208 --> 06:29.109
Oh, my God, your life is trivial.

06:29.110 --> 06:31.345
How do you stand it?

06:31.346 --> 06:33.113
Veronica, we're being gentle, remember?

06:33.114 --> 06:35.616
Less Hulk, more Bruce Banner.

06:35.617 --> 06:37.451
Come on, kid. How did you know about

06:37.452 --> 06:39.559
- Larry Pancake getting fired?
- Grace Hutchens told me.

06:39.721 --> 06:42.156
Grace Hutchens? That must
be Bert Hutchens' kid.

06:42.157 --> 06:44.958
Well, that makes sense. Bert
is head of human resources.

06:44.959 --> 06:46.070
She must have overhead
something at home.

06:46.314 --> 06:47.752
What else did Grace say?

06:47.787 --> 06:50.497
Is anyone else losing their jobs?

06:50.498 --> 06:52.733
- I don't remember.
- You don't or you won't?

06:52.734 --> 06:55.302
Veronica. Honey, if you
don't remember something,

06:55.303 --> 06:57.204
that's perfectly okay.

06:57.205 --> 07:00.774
I think grace said somebody named...

07:00.775 --> 07:03.177
Paul is also getting fired.

07:03.178 --> 07:06.814
Was it Paul Spielman?
Think, honey! Think!

07:06.815 --> 07:08.282
Or Veronica will

07:08.283 --> 07:10.484
inappropriately pressure you again.

07:12.554 --> 07:14.822
Pretty sure it was Paul Spielman.

07:14.823 --> 07:17.458
Oh, my God. Not Paul Spielman.

07:17.459 --> 07:20.427
- You have no idea who Paul Spielman is.
- Not even a little.

07:20.428 --> 07:22.529
He's one of our
department's best engineers.

07:22.530 --> 07:25.432
And they're just gonna
throw him out on the street

07:25.433 --> 07:28.335
with no consideration for how
weak that's gonna make me look?

07:28.336 --> 07:30.404
Paul might not like it either,

07:30.405 --> 07:33.307
- you know, 'cause he's got four kids.
- Fine, I'm insensitive. I can live with that.

07:33.308 --> 07:35.909
But we have to save Paul's job.

07:35.910 --> 07:38.378
Not wanting the company
to know about her book,

07:38.379 --> 07:40.447
Linda decided working
on it at the office

07:40.448 --> 07:42.182
would be too risky.

07:42.183 --> 07:43.951
- Where are you going?
- Bathroom.

07:43.952 --> 07:45.752
- With all your stuff?
- I meant my bathroom at home.

07:45.753 --> 07:47.721
I don't feel well.

07:47.722 --> 07:50.524
So I need to go home for a few days

07:50.525 --> 07:51.925
and use the bathroom.

07:51.926 --> 07:54.661
- Yeah, that hangs together.
- No, it doesn't.

07:54.662 --> 07:57.331
If I had more time, I'd bat
you around like a cat toy.

07:57.332 --> 07:59.333
But I have to save some guy's job.

07:59.334 --> 08:01.368
So do whatever you want,
because I don't care.

08:01.369 --> 08:03.470
Now that hangs together.

08:03.471 --> 08:05.739
- Veronica.
- Ugh! There are employees everywhere.

08:05.740 --> 08:07.708
It's like I'm walking
through spiderwebs.

08:07.709 --> 08:10.644
Do you know why my paycheck
is a little light this week?

08:10.645 --> 08:13.213
That's the code for the
company's legal services.

08:13.214 --> 08:15.149
Apparently you spent four hours

08:15.150 --> 08:17.885
- with one of our attorneys last week.
- Well, I've been seeing Nadine Webson,

08:17.886 --> 08:20.354
but we haven't been
doing anything legal.

08:20.355 --> 08:22.055
Wait. Let me rephrase that.

08:22.056 --> 08:24.057
All attorneys hours have
to be billed somewhere.

08:24.058 --> 08:25.959
The company doesn't care
if you're estate planning

08:25.960 --> 08:28.395
or drilling her like an oil well.

08:28.396 --> 08:31.231
If you're spending time with a
Veridian lawyer, you have to pay for it.

08:31.232 --> 08:34.301
But that's reducing my relationship

08:34.302 --> 08:37.037
- with this beautiful, intelligent woman to...
- $300 an hour.

08:39.174 --> 08:41.375
I'm sorry to barge in, Nadine.

08:41.376 --> 08:43.844
But I just heard the strangest thing.

08:43.845 --> 08:46.213
Apparently the company charges
me whenever we're together.

08:46.214 --> 08:48.982
Which means every time
I have sex with you,

08:48.983 --> 08:51.185
- I have to pay for it.
- Oh, my God. That's outrageous.

08:51.186 --> 08:52.786
I... I know. It's so...

08:52.787 --> 08:54.354
Naughty?

08:54.355 --> 08:56.657
Okay. Naughty.

08:56.658 --> 08:59.459
But... but... but
doesn't it also seem...

08:59.460 --> 09:02.963
Extremely naughty?

09:02.964 --> 09:04.064
Purr.

09:06.401 --> 09:08.335
Mm.

09:10.572 --> 09:12.873
You argue cases with that mouth?

09:12.874 --> 09:14.541
Mm-hmm. Oh!

09:16.911 --> 09:18.912
Armed with information about Spielman,

09:18.913 --> 09:22.149
Veronica and I went into
action to save his job.

09:22.150 --> 09:25.018
The sky hammer missile system
is the ultimate stealth weapon,

09:25.019 --> 09:27.454
featuring our patented
hush-a-boom technology.

09:27.455 --> 09:30.324
Hush-a-boom... when your
army wants to get in and out

09:30.325 --> 09:32.759
without waking the neighbors.

09:32.760 --> 09:34.161
Fantastic.

09:34.162 --> 09:36.630
War just keeps getting better.

09:36.631 --> 09:39.333
Thank you, but we
really should give credit

09:39.334 --> 09:41.301
to our engineer... Steven Spielberg.

09:41.302 --> 09:43.403
- Paul Spielman.
- Paul Spielman.

09:43.404 --> 09:45.505
We shouldn't even
call it the sky hammer.

09:45.506 --> 09:47.574
We should call it the Spielman.

09:47.575 --> 09:49.142
Because that's the man's name.

09:49.143 --> 09:50.677
Spielman, huh?

09:50.678 --> 09:54.529
Why don't you stop that
thing we were talking about?

09:54.949 --> 09:57.618
That's a no-go on Spielman.

09:57.619 --> 10:00.220
I repeat... no-go on Spielman.

10:00.221 --> 10:04.091
Copy that. The bird goes
back in the nest, fellas.

10:05.693 --> 10:08.829
Have a nice day, sir.

10:12.100 --> 10:15.168
If we go past 4:00, do I
have to pay for the full hour

10:15.169 --> 10:17.137
or do they bill by the quarter?

10:17.138 --> 10:18.972
I don't know. I don't handle the money.

10:21.476 --> 10:23.877
Duck. Duck. Duck...

10:23.878 --> 10:25.979
I don't like my work life

10:25.980 --> 10:27.781
and my life with Rose to overlap,

10:27.782 --> 10:29.983
but since it was just this one time,

10:29.984 --> 10:32.052
- it's hard to see the harm.
- Goose.

10:32.053 --> 10:34.988
Children... so adorable.

10:34.989 --> 10:37.090
In a way, they're like people.

10:37.091 --> 10:40.093
Yes, that's why there's
a taboo about eating them.

10:40.094 --> 10:41.928
So good news about saving Spielman.

10:41.929 --> 10:44.765
Yes.

10:44.766 --> 10:46.700
It's a shame to let a resource like Rose

10:46.701 --> 10:49.569
- go to waste, isn't it?
- No, it's not. It's fine.

10:49.570 --> 10:52.806
- Because we agreed we were gonna do this once.
- Right. We're saving people.

10:52.807 --> 10:54.708
Why would anyone ever want to do

10:54.709 --> 10:57.177
- something heroic like that more than once?
- Veronica...

10:57.178 --> 10:59.680
I get it, Ted. If it had been up to you,

10:59.681 --> 11:01.715
it wouldn't have been
"Schindler's list."

11:01.716 --> 11:03.583
It would've been "schindler's guy."

11:10.143 --> 11:12.178
Okay, how does the story end?

11:12.179 --> 11:14.380
Come on. Think. Back to basics.

11:14.381 --> 11:16.616
Lemur.

11:16.617 --> 11:17.917
Nothing.

11:19.987 --> 11:23.422
Hey, Linda. I just thought
I'd stop by on my way home

11:23.423 --> 11:24.991
and see what amazing adventures

11:24.992 --> 11:26.826
my lemur brother from
another mother is up to.

11:26.827 --> 11:28.461
He's up to nothing.

11:28.462 --> 11:31.230
He stared at me as I
ate a carton of ice cream

11:31.231 --> 11:32.932
and then judged me

11:32.933 --> 11:35.568
- as I watched four back-to-back episodes
of "Alf." - Well, maybe I can help.

11:35.569 --> 11:38.404
Oh, I once had an affair
with a 73-year-old woman.

11:38.405 --> 11:39.905
Can you use that?

11:39.906 --> 11:42.141
Only to vomit up the ice cream.

11:42.142 --> 11:44.277
I didn't have to come here, you know?

11:44.278 --> 11:45.678
I'm sorry, Phil.

11:45.679 --> 11:48.381
I... it's just... what
if I can't do this?

11:48.382 --> 11:50.383
Maybe I'm really not a writer.

11:50.384 --> 11:52.685
What if I end up just
some product tester

11:52.686 --> 11:54.487
working for a soulless company

11:54.488 --> 11:56.322
with a half-finished
lemur story in her drawer?

11:56.323 --> 11:57.790
What a clichÃ©.

11:57.791 --> 11:59.725
You can do this, Linda.

11:59.726 --> 12:02.028
Okay, what do you have so far?

12:02.029 --> 12:04.530
The lemur feels stifled,
living his small,

12:04.531 --> 12:06.599
uninspired life in his little tree.

12:06.600 --> 12:10.870
His friends rally around him
and help him find the courage

12:10.871 --> 12:13.105
to go off and seek his fortune.

12:13.106 --> 12:14.273
Okay.

12:14.274 --> 12:16.175
What if he geta summer job

12:16.176 --> 12:18.177
driving a van for meals on wheels

12:18.178 --> 12:20.079
and meets a sexually
adventurous elderly lemur

12:20.080 --> 12:22.715
who roughly takes his virginity?

12:24.184 --> 12:25.951
Thanks for stopping by, Phil.

12:25.952 --> 12:27.653
Wait.

12:27.654 --> 12:29.822
Why does the lemur need
to leave the tree anyway?

12:29.823 --> 12:31.757
Because the tree is stifling

12:31.758 --> 12:34.060
and the Linda has a
dream... the lemur...

12:34.061 --> 12:35.961
the lemur has a dream,

12:35.962 --> 12:38.464
and she... me... he knows
there's more to life.

12:38.465 --> 12:42.034
Why would he want tay
in a little, tiny tree?

12:42.035 --> 12:45.304
Maybe because that's
where all his friends are.

12:45.305 --> 12:48.140
No, you said the other lemurs
rally around and help him.

12:48.141 --> 12:50.509
Maybe that makes him
decide he should stay.

12:50.510 --> 12:53.212
That's it. That's the perfect ending.

12:53.213 --> 12:54.647
The lemur realizes

12:54.648 --> 12:57.249
he doesn't need to go
off and seek his fortune

12:57.250 --> 12:58.417
yeah.

12:58.418 --> 13:00.686
Because the only
fortune anyone ever needs

13:00.687 --> 13:02.188
is friendship.

13:02.189 --> 13:03.422
Oh.

13:03.423 --> 13:05.825
And when you have that,
you wouldn't leave it

13:05.826 --> 13:07.860
for all the adventure in the world.

13:07.861 --> 13:12.098
Suck it, Veridian! I
am rich and outta here!

13:14.701 --> 13:16.769
I was just in the neighborhood

13:16.770 --> 13:18.671
and thought Rose might enjoy some pizza.

13:18.672 --> 13:20.673
I don't usually feed Rose pizza

13:20.674 --> 13:23.109
at 11:30 on a school
night while she's asleep.

13:23.110 --> 13:26.178
But everyone's happy to
wake up for pizza or Candy

13:26.179 --> 13:28.280
or a signed photograph of Zac Efron.

13:28.281 --> 13:31.117
There she is. What's the matter, honey?

13:31.118 --> 13:33.219
You couldn't sleep
because you were worried

13:33.220 --> 13:35.421
there might be more
cutbacks in our department,

13:35.422 --> 13:37.390
and that might reflect badly on me?

13:37.391 --> 13:40.726
No. Somebody out here isn't
using hush-a-boom technology.

13:40.727 --> 13:42.661
Veronica, I told you,
we're not pumping Rose

13:42.662 --> 13:45.598
- for any more information.
- I don't know anything else anyway.

13:45.599 --> 13:48.401
I told you all the new
stuff I heard at dinner.

13:48.402 --> 13:50.903
I... I couldn't resist.
I like saving people.

13:50.904 --> 13:53.205
I make no apologies. I'm sorry.

13:53.206 --> 13:55.074
Oh, my God. What a hypocrite.

13:55.075 --> 13:57.510
I feel like I don't
know you. Fake outrage.

13:57.511 --> 14:00.613
- Moving on. What did you get out of her?
- Okay, here's the deal...

14:00.614 --> 14:02.581
Jeffrey Bouchard's daughter told Rose
that their family's moving  on Saturday.

14:02.582 --> 14:05.351
They're going to Seattle.

14:05.352 --> 14:07.586
- Jeffrey Bouchard.
- Another engineer.

14:07.587 --> 14:09.522
There's a picture of you
two on your office wall.

14:09.523 --> 14:12.391
People always want to have their
pictures taken with me, Ted.

14:12.392 --> 14:13.959
I'm like a sunset.

14:13.960 --> 14:15.928
Anyway, why is my new best
friend Jeffrey Bouchard

14:15.929 --> 14:17.930
suddenly moving to... wait a minute.

14:17.931 --> 14:21.000
- Zell Industries is in Seattle.
- Yes, and they're developing a missile system

14:21.001 --> 14:23.402
very similar to the sky hammer.

14:23.403 --> 14:25.938
Bouchard is planning to steal
hush-a-boom technology and jump ship.

14:25.939 --> 14:28.374
How could he do this?

14:28.375 --> 14:31.310
And after I let him
use me like a sunset.

14:31.311 --> 14:33.312
Well, you better take his picture down.

14:33.313 --> 14:35.514
Maybe put it in your
drawer next to the one

14:35.515 --> 14:37.783
of you and Saddam Hussein
riding that tandem bike.

14:37.784 --> 14:39.452
Yeah. That was before he got weird.

14:40.954 --> 14:42.888
The next day, bright and early,

14:42.889 --> 14:46.192
Jeffrey Bouchard got a little surprise.

14:46.193 --> 14:48.127
Jeffrey Bouchard...

15:01.041 --> 15:03.075
We've got a rabbit.

15:03.076 --> 15:05.878
Aah!

15:05.879 --> 15:07.680
Oh, that's Jeffrey Bouchard.

15:07.681 --> 15:09.682
I love it when they run.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.253
Tased flesh smells bacon-y.

15:15.388 --> 15:17.523
Now I'm hungry.

15:17.524 --> 15:18.757
Nadine?

15:18.758 --> 15:20.826
I'll be right out.

15:20.827 --> 15:23.496
Can't wait tsee you.

15:23.497 --> 15:25.498
I mean it.

15:25.499 --> 15:26.866
Hurry.

15:33.473 --> 15:35.307
Oh, boy.

15:35.308 --> 15:38.344
It's gonna me 300 bucks just
to get you outta that rig.

15:38.345 --> 15:41.680
- I thought you would like this.
- No, I do, I do. It's sexy.

15:41.681 --> 15:43.749
You know what would be really sexy?

15:43.750 --> 15:46.185
If you could do some work
for another billable client

15:46.186 --> 15:48.420
- while I take it off you.
- That would be fraud.

15:48.421 --> 15:51.423
So now you're asking me
to commit a crime for you.

15:51.424 --> 15:55.861
A naughty, naughty crime. Purr.

15:55.862 --> 15:57.162
Purr.

15:57.163 --> 15:59.698
Okay, first of all, you
can't just say "purr."

15:59.699 --> 16:02.301
You actually have to make the sound.

16:02.302 --> 16:04.136
And that's not even my biggest problem

16:04.137 --> 16:07.406
with all of this.

16:09.910 --> 16:11.944
Phil. Oh, my God.

16:11.945 --> 16:14.179
I just got off the phone with my mom.

16:14.180 --> 16:16.615
- She saw my lemur on the Internet.
- I'm on the Internet!

16:16.616 --> 16:18.684
Shh. The company can't
find out about this.

16:18.685 --> 16:20.619
They'll take it away from me.

16:20.620 --> 16:22.621
I just turned in my manuscript,

16:22.622 --> 16:25.491
- and my publisher is already promoting it.
- I could help promote it.

16:25.492 --> 16:27.326
I'm a pretty decent ice skater.

16:27.327 --> 16:29.395
Maybe I could have my own capade.

16:29.396 --> 16:32.965
Oh, you will have a capade, my friend.

16:32.966 --> 16:35.434
My mom said it's on some asian web site.

16:35.435 --> 16:39.171
- Your mom is really tech savvy.
- That is so hot.

16:39.172 --> 16:41.206
Why did I say that?

16:41.207 --> 16:43.175
- Oh, look! There he is.
- Oh.

16:43.176 --> 16:45.778
Oh, he's so cute.

16:45.779 --> 16:47.746
Yum yum!

16:47.747 --> 16:49.615
- What is he doing?
- Yum yum!

16:49.616 --> 16:51.684
I don't know. It looks like it's...

16:51.685 --> 16:53.819
Yum yum!

16:53.820 --> 16:55.554
An ad.

16:55.555 --> 16:57.823
Yum yum!

16:57.824 --> 17:00.626
- For beer.
- Yum yum!

17:02.429 --> 17:05.531
For children.

17:08.801 --> 17:10.935
So you have a good afternoon.

17:10.936 --> 17:13.372
Remember, your main job is to have fun.

17:13.373 --> 17:16.075
But if you happen to hear anything...

17:16.076 --> 17:18.477
Today, I'm going to
concentrate on Vanessa.

17:18.478 --> 17:20.646
There's something going on there.

17:27.420 --> 17:29.488
I want to report a children's book

17:29.489 --> 17:31.490
that a veridian employee
sold to another company.

17:31.491 --> 17:33.726
I demand veridian take
possession of it immediately

17:33.727 --> 17:35.961
and not punish the person who wrote it.

17:35.962 --> 17:38.364
I feel very strongly
about that last part.

17:38.365 --> 17:40.332
Is this about that book you were writing

17:40.333 --> 17:43.202
- while you were pretending to be sick?
- How did you...

17:43.203 --> 17:45.104
all I have to do is look at Phil,

17:45.105 --> 17:46.605
and he tells me everything,

17:46.606 --> 17:48.540
even things I don't want to know,

17:48.541 --> 17:51.610
- like his time-saving system for
washing his legs. - I just found out

17:51.611 --> 17:54.013
my publisher is owned by
a huge, evil conglomerate

17:54.014 --> 17:57.316
that's using my character to
sell beer to children in Asia.

17:57.317 --> 18:00.219
God, I love Asia. There's
no regulation on anything.

18:00.220 --> 18:03.055
Did you know companies there can
just shoot a man in the street?

18:03.056 --> 18:04.990
I heard that at a conference

18:04.991 --> 18:06.892
about reasons to move
your business to Asia.

18:06.893 --> 18:08.360
I know.

18:08.361 --> 18:10.696
They make it crazy hard
to kill anyone here.

18:10.697 --> 18:12.197
I want my country back.

18:12.198 --> 18:14.533
Anyway, if the company
takes ownership of my book,

18:14.534 --> 18:16.468
they can stop these ads, right?

18:16.469 --> 18:19.371
Yes, but it'll be tied up
in litigation for years.

18:19.372 --> 18:22.274
Your book's not gonna be
your ticket outta here.

18:22.275 --> 18:23.909
I have no choice.

18:23.910 --> 18:25.444
Look at you.

18:25.445 --> 18:28.313
You were so anxious to
get away from this place,

18:28.314 --> 18:30.783
and now you have a problem

18:30.784 --> 18:33.185
and who do you come running to for help?

18:33.186 --> 18:35.521
The company. The glorious company.

18:35.522 --> 18:37.690
- Say it with me.
- The glorious company.

18:37.691 --> 18:40.426
I'm kidding. I just wanted
to see if you'd do it.

18:40.427 --> 18:43.462
- Now say...
- Veronica.

18:43.463 --> 18:45.964
So Linda didn't get to quit her day job.

18:45.965 --> 18:47.966
But like her lemur, she realized

18:47.967 --> 18:50.869
she could find something nice
about where she already was.

18:50.870 --> 18:54.006
"And the lemur said to all
of his friends in the forest,

18:54.007 --> 18:55.841
'I love you guys, even you, lion,

18:55.842 --> 18:58.277
who devoured my friend Keith.'"

18:58.278 --> 19:01.714
- Rose.
- And I realized maybe using Rose's help

19:01.715 --> 19:04.116
to know what's going on around
here isn't such a bad thing.

19:04.117 --> 19:06.185
So anything interesting happen today?

19:06.186 --> 19:08.520
Oh, yeah. I found out something funny.

19:08.521 --> 19:11.090
Amy Bouchard's father
wasn't taking her to Seattle.

19:11.091 --> 19:13.726
He's taking her to see cattle.

19:13.727 --> 19:15.494
She isn't moving away.

19:15.495 --> 19:17.496
Her dad just likes looking at cows.

19:17.497 --> 19:19.364
Uh... daddy's gotta go fix something.

19:19.365 --> 19:22.935
So why don't you go listen
to the rest of that book?

19:22.936 --> 19:24.570
And no more spying.

19:24.571 --> 19:26.605
It's my fault, but you shouldn't do it.

19:26.606 --> 19:29.374
Now don't let it worry
you, but daddy's gonna turn

19:29.375 --> 19:32.644
and run away as fast as he can.

19:37.350 --> 19:39.284
Our team...

19:39.285 --> 19:41.687
Over 100,000 strong...

19:41.688 --> 19:45.290
And we love all of them.

19:45.291 --> 19:47.826
Unless they cross us.

19:47.827 --> 19:51.230
Then we'll hunt them down and hurt them,

19:51.231 --> 19:53.932
because that's love, too...

19:54.334 --> 19:57.510
Veridian Dynamics. Don't cross us

19:57.511 --> 19:58.370
Ever.

19:58.371 --> 19:59.600
Seriously.

19:59.601 --> 20:01.998
Just don't.

20:04.095 --> 20:07.880
Jeffrey, there is no question
bad things were ne to you,

20:07.880 --> 20:10.507
and there is also no
question whose fault it was.

20:10.507 --> 20:11.764
Ted.

20:13.426 --> 20:17.555
- I got tasered, Ted.
- I know, and I'm very sorry.

20:17.555 --> 20:19.724
A... and if there's any way
I can make it up to you...

20:19.724 --> 20:21.311
Maybe you can.

20:22.643 --> 20:24.188
Let me see that taser you got.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.233
Oh, Jeffrey...

20:33.655 --> 20:35.658
I'm so sorry!
