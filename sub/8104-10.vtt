00:15.599 --> 00:16.683
Hi.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.143
Sounds like a good party.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.853
Twenty bucks.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.313
Okay, no problem.

00:22.439 --> 00:25.650
I... Just...
I got it in here somewhere.

00:29.655 --> 00:31.823
Oh, you know, I'm...

00:31.949 --> 00:35.410
I'm sorry, I guess I must have
forgotten to go to the machine.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.204
Yeah, and brush your teeth.

00:38.330 --> 00:40.748
Lady, you don't have two cents.

00:41.667 --> 00:44.794
Well, I can... I can get it from,
from my friend who's inside.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.629
He can give it to me,
and then I'll bring it back out to you.

00:46.755 --> 00:47.755
You don't know anybody here.

00:47.881 --> 00:48.840
Yes, I do.

00:48.966 --> 00:53.553
James. He's blond, and he's really
friendly, and he's a big talker.

00:53.679 --> 00:55.346
I need to see him.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.727
Go on in.

01:22.124 --> 01:23.416
James?

01:27.546 --> 01:30.590
James?

01:30.716 --> 01:31.716
Hi.

01:32.426 --> 01:33.760
Do you know where James is?

01:33.969 --> 01:35.470
Oh, yeah, he's...

01:35.637 --> 01:37.013
He's around here somewhere.

01:50.152 --> 01:51.819
Let's go find him.

01:55.866 --> 01:58.826
James?
Do you know where James is?

01:59.912 --> 02:01.204
Where's James? James?

02:01.330 --> 02:07.794
James? James?

02:07.920 --> 02:09.420
Oh, yeah, he's around here somewhere.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.088
Where is he?

02:16.929 --> 02:20.014
Please. I really need to find him.

02:32.194 --> 02:33.903
What are you doing?

02:36.114 --> 02:37.323
Bitch!

02:53.257 --> 02:55.216
No! She's trying to help me!

02:55.342 --> 02:58.553
Get off her! Get off! Get off me!

03:01.306 --> 03:02.932
Settle down!

03:03.976 --> 03:04.892
Move!

03:05.894 --> 03:08.145
Jeez. I didn't touch her.

03:08.939 --> 03:12.316
Great. Now we gotta go to the hospital.

03:46.852 --> 03:50.771
Homeless. Admitted 24 hours ago
with a suspected drug overdose.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.733
Her tox screen's clean,
but she's still delusional.

03:53.859 --> 03:57.111
"Homeless."
Usually means crazy, no money.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.237
Cuddy's not gonna be...

03:58.363 --> 04:00.031
We're a teaching hospital.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.491
No ID. Doesn't even seem
to know her name.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.785
I got called in
because of some lesions on her arm.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.246
Homeless always means no roof.
Leads to too much sun.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.706
No, the lesions were non-cancerous.

04:08.832 --> 04:11.918
But I noticed a twitch. Her wrist.

04:17.049 --> 04:18.132
You feel that?

04:18.258 --> 04:20.509
Sure, I'm human.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.512
Make a fist around my fingers
as tight as you can.

04:23.639 --> 04:24.680
Squeeze.

04:24.806 --> 04:25.806
I am.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.978
All right.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.773
Raise your arms
above your head for me.

04:36.902 --> 04:37.902
Oh.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.738
She's seizing. Get me some Ativan.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.031
She doesn't want to be discharged.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.824
She's manipulating you.

04:46.078 --> 04:48.579
It's real. Check a finger stick.

04:53.251 --> 04:54.669
Blood sugar's 38.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.337
I need D50 IV push, stat.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.759
Fake low blood sugar.
Now, that's acting.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.219
The blood sugar was real.

05:03.345 --> 05:04.637
She's probably diabetic.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.263
OD'd on her own insulin.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.851
Room 2032.
Do you have her effects out here?

05:10.978 --> 05:12.979
Look, a seizure buys her
a place to sleep

05:13.105 --> 05:14.647
while the nice doctors run their tests.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.732
Maybe a few free meals.

05:17.943 --> 05:20.861
Twenty bucks says
there's insulin in there.

05:22.406 --> 05:25.366
Oh! Wow. Put this back, please.

05:26.702 --> 05:27.827
What about the twitch?

05:27.953 --> 05:29.954
- Her arm moved.
- Why fake a twitch?

05:30.080 --> 05:31.706
In case the seizure was too subtle?

05:31.832 --> 05:34.417
The twitch could indicate a tumor,
which could indicate...

05:34.543 --> 05:37.753
A need to see a neurologist,
which is why you called me.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.005
Keep an eye on her till 2:00 p.m.

05:39.131 --> 05:41.716
Watch her blood sugar,
give her a nice hot lunch.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.759
Then discharge her.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.556
He's wrong.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.182
Foreman is wrong?

05:50.851 --> 05:53.394
The neurologist is wrong
about a neurological problem?

05:53.520 --> 05:55.855
He took one look at her
and figured it was a scam.

05:55.981 --> 05:58.315
So you figure he's not being objective.

05:58.442 --> 06:02.153
House, the woman had a twitch.
She had a seizure.

06:02.279 --> 06:03.446
Both of which Foreman saw?

06:03.572 --> 06:05.531
He just wanted her out the door!

06:05.657 --> 06:08.743
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Back up here, big fellow.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.162
Foreman's the guy you want to
take a swing at.

06:13.749 --> 06:16.959
I just want her to get
some medical attention.

06:19.546 --> 06:22.048
That's not even close to being true.

06:22.174 --> 06:24.884
It's something else.
Something personal.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.805
Give me the file.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.729
Looks like this'll be fun.

06:37.564 --> 06:40.691
The twitch could be a mini-seizure,
unrelated to the diabetes.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.276
Brain tumor?

06:42.402 --> 06:44.195
Glad you could join us, Eric.

06:44.321 --> 06:47.490
What's the differential for
a twitch in the wrist?

06:47.616 --> 06:48.949
The patient's a 30-ish Jane Doe.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.618
I thought I just discharged her.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.036
Well, she's my patient.

06:52.204 --> 06:53.746
No harm in a second opinion.

06:53.872 --> 06:56.332
A blow to the head?
A subdural hematoma?

06:56.458 --> 06:58.793
Read the file.
No evidence of cranial trauma.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.628
A twitch could indicate a brain tumor.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.379
Or about a dozen other things!

07:02.506 --> 07:05.257
Come on. There's two things
homeless people are good at.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.301
Getting sick and running scams.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.137
If you're so worried about it being
a brain tumor, get her an MRI.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.348
When she's clear on that,
then you can bounce her out of here.

07:12.474 --> 07:14.183
Well, you've got her all figured out.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.102
I've known a lot more homeless people
than you have.

07:16.228 --> 07:17.645
Yes, you've got that going for you.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.814
How could I have doubted
your medical opinion?

07:19.940 --> 07:21.690
The big question.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.359
You're missing it, all of you.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.402
Oh, jeez.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.154
Who is she?

07:27.823 --> 07:29.615
Okay, why are we on this case?

07:29.741 --> 07:31.033
Just because Wilson asked?

07:31.159 --> 07:32.618
Do I need a better reason?

07:32.744 --> 07:34.662
Well, most people wouldn't. You do.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.467
The only thing we know for sure
about Jane Doe

07:48.593 --> 07:50.344
is that her name isn't Jane Doe,

07:50.470 --> 07:52.138
which means no medical history.

07:52.264 --> 07:55.307
Allergies, medication,
previous diagnoses, treatment.

07:55.433 --> 07:58.519
We have no baseline,
no context for medical treatment.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.896
Wow. Looks just like insulin.

08:01.565 --> 08:04.108
Vomit. Still moist.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.152
What do you think? Couple of days old?

08:07.362 --> 08:08.404
You trying to make me hurl?

08:08.530 --> 08:11.031
Yeah. And here's the big finish.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.536
Salty. Chemical imbalance.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.038
Low magnesium could cause a twitch.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.583
Or high calcium. Or it's a coincidence.

08:20.709 --> 08:21.625
The point is, we don't know anything.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.210
So do the MRI. Find out.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.753
The MRI can wait.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.715
Hang a banana bag. Give her 24 hours
to correct the electrolyte imbalance.

08:27.841 --> 08:28.924
We'll take it from there.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.801
Great. Thanks.

08:36.766 --> 08:38.434
Okay,
even if she's not faking,

08:38.560 --> 08:40.477
what's so fascinating about this case?

08:40.854 --> 08:44.565
At the moment, how much
you don't want me to take it.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.692
That's pretty fascinating.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.115
Nice likeness of Dr. Foreman.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.326
In fact, he's never looked better.

08:58.330 --> 09:01.290
He doesn't like me. I can tell.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.918
It's okay. He doesn't like me, either.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.586
Who's James?

09:07.756 --> 09:08.589
Ow!

09:08.715 --> 09:10.674
Pain in your head?

09:10.800 --> 09:12.301
Get away from me!

09:12.427 --> 09:13.260
No, no, no, no!

09:13.386 --> 09:14.595
All right, let's cool her out.

09:14.721 --> 09:15.930
One milligram Ativan, push.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.432
No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

09:18.558 --> 09:19.850
Hold on.

09:24.648 --> 09:25.898
She bit me!

09:27.692 --> 09:29.985
Good news is,
she's negative for HIV and hep C.

09:30.111 --> 09:33.113
Yeah? I'm getting a tetanus shot.
She's getting an MRI.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.740
There's a two-day wait for
non-emergency MRIs.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.659
She's getting an MRI,
then she's out of here.

09:38.787 --> 09:41.121
But Dr. Terhark specifically said

09:41.248 --> 09:42.748
I'd have the MRI at 10:00.

09:42.874 --> 09:46.001
It's almost 11:00, and I haven't even
had the pre-test yet.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.586
Sorry. We're a little backed up.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.715
Excuse me. You're Dr. Terhark's 10:00?

09:51.841 --> 09:53.342
I'm Angela Whitney.

09:53.468 --> 09:57.346
I'm meeting my decorator at 11:30.
She's coming all the way from New York.

09:57.472 --> 10:00.140
Dr. Terhark promised
I'd be home in time.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.476
Of course.

10:13.905 --> 10:16.740
She just about prepped for her MRI?

10:17.701 --> 10:19.285
Mrs. Whitney?

10:22.497 --> 10:25.165
You tried to steal someone else's test.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.626
Dr. Terhark is a plastic surgeon.

10:27.752 --> 10:31.255
The woman was getting a six-month
checkup on her chin implants.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.674
I can't believe you authorized this.

10:33.800 --> 10:34.842
Really?

10:34.968 --> 10:37.594
It sounds exactly
like something I'd do.

10:37.721 --> 10:39.513
She can't have an MRI.

10:41.182 --> 10:44.184
The CT scan shows
she has a surgical pin in her arm.

10:44.311 --> 10:48.188
The MRI magnet would have ripped it
out of her body.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.940
You like the 'Alien' movies?

10:50.066 --> 10:53.527
You had no medical history.
What were you thinking?

10:53.653 --> 10:55.487
We'll surgically remove the pin,
then do the MRI.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.281
Does that sound good?

10:57.699 --> 10:59.658
She has an electrolyte imbalance.

10:59.784 --> 11:03.662
Dr. Foreman, a neurologist, believes
this woman has a brain tumor.

11:03.788 --> 11:04.872
- Actually, I...
- Hey,

11:04.998 --> 11:07.166
don't ever apologize
for a medical opinion.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.501
If he's right and we don't do
this test, the patient dies.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.754
Now I realize that
you have a specialty of your own,

11:11.880 --> 11:13.964
but does yours have anything
to do with the brain?

11:14.090 --> 11:15.466
His does.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.677
Fine.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.804
But nothing more
until you find out who she is.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.848
- How are we supposed to...
- Hey!

11:22.974 --> 11:25.976
He knows more homeless people
than any of us.

11:27.729 --> 11:30.481
Go check out the 'hood, dawg.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.613
I don't know.

11:37.906 --> 11:42.326
I've seen a lot of faces around here,

11:42.452 --> 11:44.495
but I don't think I know her.

11:46.956 --> 11:47.956
Great.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.335
Say, I like that jacket.

11:52.170 --> 11:58.425
Yeah, it's all coming to me now.
I know where she keeps her stuff.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.059
Just bats.

12:08.311 --> 12:10.938
I thought the lining would be thicker.

12:30.959 --> 12:33.127
No tumor. Nothing. Her brain is clear.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.212
Which means that girl had surgery

12:35.338 --> 12:37.214
just so you wouldn't get
reamed out by Cuddy.

12:37.340 --> 12:38.632
Not necessarily.
There could still be something

12:38.758 --> 12:40.008
neurological going on.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.219
Sure. She's not conning us. The MRI is.

12:42.345 --> 12:43.929
Not wearing a coat in this weather.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.639
That is so wrong.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.099
She drew these.

12:47.225 --> 12:48.892
They might give us a clue.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.728
She sign them?
Her name would be a start.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.897
All the mythology, the locations,

12:54.065 --> 12:55.774
they'd all depend on
her life experience.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.734
Philadelphia.

12:57.861 --> 12:59.695
Look at that skyline.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.363
It's very evocative.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.741
The Chrysler Building. That's a cloud.

13:04.868 --> 13:06.785
And the Chrysler Building's
in New York.

13:06.911 --> 13:07.870
I'm getting Philly.

13:07.996 --> 13:11.039
And that cactus, well,
it's a smashed car.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.666
It's a car accident.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.042
A cactus in Philadelphia?

13:14.169 --> 13:16.003
Water. Well, water's October, right?

13:16.129 --> 13:17.212
Obviously.

13:17.338 --> 13:22.050
Well, the page number 22.
So that's October 2, 2002.

13:22.177 --> 13:25.512
Ergo, the patient was in a car accident
two years ago last October.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.223
My goodness. Was she okay?

13:28.349 --> 13:30.684
Broke her arm, I think.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.103
They fixed it with this.

13:35.148 --> 13:38.025
Surgical pin. Better than a wallet.

13:38.151 --> 13:41.111
Serial numbers in case of recall,
tied to a patient's name.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.071
That's why you insisted on the MRI,

13:43.198 --> 13:45.782
so you could remove the surgical pin
from her arm?

13:45.909 --> 13:48.285
You didn't think I was gonna do it
to save your sorry ass, did you?

13:49.579 --> 13:51.788
You might want to take a look at that.

13:51.915 --> 13:54.750
Her name is Victoria Matsen, or at
least that's the one she used then.

13:54.876 --> 13:56.418
Any hospital with
a record of treating her

13:56.586 --> 13:57.836
should be sending that information.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.671
Oh, crap!

13:59.797 --> 14:02.466
Her blood work came back an hour ago.
Magnesium was normal.

14:02.592 --> 14:03.634
Did you change her banana bag?

14:03.760 --> 14:06.303
Stopped the magnesium, started
iron dextran for severe anemia.

14:06.429 --> 14:08.222
She's allergic to iron dextran.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.769
Grab some epi off the code cart.

14:16.648 --> 14:18.106
Respiratory arrest. Call a code!

14:18.233 --> 14:20.776
You're having an allergic reaction.
Can you speak?

14:22.028 --> 14:23.946
She's not getting any air.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.241
Got the epi.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.409
Sats are down in the 80s and dropping.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.703
We have about another minute.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.678
Well,
we got her sedated and stabilized.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.264
And you still think
there's nothing wrong with her?

14:50.390 --> 14:51.765
Nothing's changed.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.560
You almost killed her.
That's different.

14:54.686 --> 14:56.019
And we know who she is.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.896
So far,
we've heard from three hospitals

14:58.064 --> 15:02.234
with records on Victoria Matsen.
Seven visits going back two years.

15:02.360 --> 15:03.610
Any home addresses?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.445
The pin in her arm went in
during an ER visit.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.739
She wasn't conscious,
so they didn't get an address.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.783
The other visits,
she gave fake addresses.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.577
Any treatment for
neurological problems?

15:11.703 --> 15:12.828
Anything that might explain the twitch?

15:12.954 --> 15:14.746
Last winter,
Jefferson Hospital in Philly.

15:14.872 --> 15:16.832
Got treated for frostbite.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.834
Baby, it's cold outside.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.336
And depression. They put her on Prozac.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.796
Well, I'd be bummed out, too.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.423
Zero degrees, living in a box.

15:24.549 --> 15:27.551
Put her back on it. She cheers up,
she might stop biting people.

15:27.677 --> 15:30.679
There's a billing record
from Hartman Hospital last year.

15:30.805 --> 15:32.222
Two appointments, ultrasounds.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.390
Doesn't say what for.

15:33.558 --> 15:34.558
Pregnant?

15:34.684 --> 15:36.685
Only if she was expecting an elephant.

15:36.811 --> 15:39.021
Appointments were 10 months apart.

15:39.147 --> 15:41.815
Kept the first, blew off the second.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.109
Abdominal pain.

15:44.235 --> 15:45.277
Her chart doesn't say...

15:45.403 --> 15:46.403
Wait a minute.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.280
She goes in the first time.

15:48.406 --> 15:49.823
They look, they can't find anything.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.534
Ten months later, why should
she subject herself to that again?

15:52.660 --> 15:53.744
Why make
a second appointment?

15:53.870 --> 15:54.745
She didn't.

15:54.871 --> 15:57.289
The nurse made the appointment.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.459
They were looking...

16:00.627 --> 16:02.544
They were looking for ovarian cancer.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.506
You got all of that
from one canceled appointment?

16:06.633 --> 16:08.550
With Jerry Lauseng, yeah.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.385
He's an oncologist.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.263
Hang on. Her current blood work
doesn't show cancer.

16:13.389 --> 16:14.681
CA-125 is normal.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.100
And the cancer wouldn't account for
the alleged twitch

16:17.226 --> 16:18.685
or any of her other alleged symptoms.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.437
Actually, it would.

16:20.563 --> 16:23.023
Neoplastic syndrome
associated with the cancer

16:23.149 --> 16:27.194
could cause her to twitch
like a bunny on crystal meth.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.863
Ultrasound her ovaries.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.867
Did you find a brain tumor on her MRI?

16:33.993 --> 16:35.702
No. Foreman was wrong.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.330
I'm starting to wonder about
that guy's medical chops.

16:38.456 --> 16:39.831
Right.

16:39.957 --> 16:40.874
Shelley Diamond.

16:41.000 --> 16:41.833
Yeah.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.543
Dr. House is ready
to see you now.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.713
The little ones are licking
each other again,

16:46.839 --> 16:49.800
and Harry's got a seeping wart
on his extra toe.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.677
What room should we go to?

16:54.430 --> 16:56.723
Do you know what? I think I might be
coming down with something.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.267
Hate to give it to you guys. Sorry.

16:59.394 --> 17:02.479
Oh, yeah. Just walk out.
Like I'm not gonna do anything.

17:02.605 --> 17:03.897
Bye-bye.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.115
Working hard?

17:14.867 --> 17:16.910
This stuff's pretty good.

17:17.036 --> 17:20.288
'Calendraica' works
for the Council of Genius.

17:20.415 --> 17:21.873
Bad guy is Mr. Fury.

17:21.999 --> 17:24.084
Fairly generic, no special skills,

17:24.252 --> 17:26.294
but apparently very well organized.

17:26.421 --> 17:27.838
You think you work hard?

17:28.005 --> 17:29.172
Try ruling the universe.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.717
You trying to teach me something here?

17:31.843 --> 17:34.511
We got the flowing dress, the ring.

17:34.637 --> 17:36.138
Think the patient was married?

17:36.264 --> 17:37.389
Maybe it was a bad break-up.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.808
Maybe he dumped her
'cause she was on drugs.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.894
You care about her personal history?

17:43.020 --> 17:44.438
No.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.524
Question is, why don't you?

17:47.650 --> 17:50.986
I hate to cite a cliché,
but Dad on the streets?

17:52.822 --> 17:54.239
Dad's with Mom.

17:54.365 --> 17:55.657
They're both living on the streets?

17:55.783 --> 17:57.492
No. On a pension.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.954
So, who pissed you off?

18:03.166 --> 18:04.833
Right now, you.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.508
Your turn.
You gonna tell me why this case?

18:13.634 --> 18:16.136
She's my new girlfriend.
I'm having a tattoo designed.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.679
I was hoping
you could find out her name.

18:17.805 --> 18:21.308
So she's just another sick person
that kindly Dr. Wilson has made sure

18:21.434 --> 18:23.351
doesn't get lost in the big,
ugly system.

18:23.478 --> 18:25.729
Yes, I forgot.
I need a reason to give a crap.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.063
You're giving two craps.

18:27.190 --> 18:29.316
The metric system always confuses me.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.901
Dr. House?

18:33.321 --> 18:35.280
Time for Girl Scout Cookies already?

18:35.406 --> 18:36.823
Get me some Thin Mints.

18:36.949 --> 18:40.535
Since you're too sick
to work in the clinic...

18:42.955 --> 18:43.914
Okay.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.999
I thought you...

18:47.627 --> 18:49.586
I thought you could do some teaching.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.296
Patient histories.

18:51.422 --> 18:52.839
My specialty.

18:53.841 --> 18:56.092
When you teach, you learn so much.
Don't you think?

18:56.219 --> 18:58.845
It's all about the giving back.

19:01.516 --> 19:04.351
Good old Cuddy. Always thinking.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.896
She assign you a patient to interview?

19:09.148 --> 19:11.399
Then why are you still here?

19:20.868 --> 19:22.452
Why are we on this case?

19:22.578 --> 19:24.287
'Cause Wilson asked House
to do him a favor.

19:24.413 --> 19:27.624
I think House just wants to prove
she's sick so Foreman will be wrong.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.209
Oh, you boys.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.169
Hey, I'm just doing my job.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.548
Whoa!

19:37.260 --> 19:41.680
Foreman's gonna be so embarrassed
when he finds out she's got cancer.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.646
I thought you were too sick
to be down here.

19:49.772 --> 19:53.275
I had to get away from those students,
so I faked a page.

19:53.734 --> 19:57.946
Foreman's parents,
happily married, 40 years.

19:58.823 --> 20:01.283
- Mazel tov.
- Kein ayin hara.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.160
So, why does he hate homeless people?

20:05.037 --> 20:06.997
I mean, if it's an uncle
or a grandparent,

20:07.123 --> 20:09.624
you'd think he'd use it
in his college application essay.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.878
Family struggles beats
a 4.0 GPA any day.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.589
I think he had a 4.0.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.340
Maybe he's just a snob.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.885
You really don't need to know
everything about everybody.

20:20.011 --> 20:23.346
I don't need to watch 'The OC',
but it makes me happy.

20:23.472 --> 20:26.516
Yeah, delirious. What's the other file?

20:28.644 --> 20:31.646
Wilson, James. Boy Wonder Oncologist.

20:31.772 --> 20:32.772
You know him?

20:32.899 --> 20:36.359
You know, in some cultures,
it's considered almost rude

20:36.485 --> 20:38.695
for one friend to spy on another.

20:38.821 --> 20:41.114
Of course, in Swedish,
the word "friend"

20:41.240 --> 20:44.242
can also be translated as
"limping twerp."

20:48.164 --> 20:52.208
Did your pager really just go off,
or are you ditching the conversation?

20:52.710 --> 20:55.295
Why can't both be true? Come on.

20:56.672 --> 20:59.841
Solid,
non-cystic mass on the left ovary.

20:59.967 --> 21:02.052
Five by three centimeters.

21:02.178 --> 21:04.012
Central necrosis.

21:04.138 --> 21:07.933
The only question is whether
she dies in two months or three.

21:08.434 --> 21:09.434
God.

21:09.560 --> 21:10.477
You were right.

21:10.603 --> 21:11.978
There's nothing we can do for her here.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.189
Might as well put her back
on the street.

21:15.024 --> 21:16.691
Unless it's not cancer.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.485
You're joking.

21:18.653 --> 21:20.278
Well, hard not to.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.405
Nothing funnier than cancer.

21:22.657 --> 21:24.240
But what if it's a tuberculoma?

21:24.367 --> 21:26.910
She's living out on the streets,
breathing all kinds of crap 24-7.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.161
The odds are, she's got TB.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.497
Why can't she have a nice,
benign growth to go with it?

21:30.623 --> 21:32.707
A solid mass on her ovary.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.960
Ovarian cancer's way more likely.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.755
You're right. It's not even close.

21:38.881 --> 21:41.633
Start her on INH,
rifampin and streptomycin.

21:41.759 --> 21:44.719
But that's the treatment for
a tuberculoma.

21:44.845 --> 21:48.181
And what is the treatment for
advanced ovarian cancer?

21:50.518 --> 21:51.935
Pine box.

21:59.110 --> 22:01.194
Oncologist
to Nuclear Medicine.

22:01.362 --> 22:03.488
Oncologist to Nuclear Medicine.

22:03.614 --> 22:04.698
What are you giving me?

22:04.824 --> 22:06.866
A second dose of
antibiotics.

22:08.202 --> 22:11.621
If you've got a tuberculoma,
it should help.

22:12.540 --> 22:15.750
I don't have a tuberculoma, do I?

22:20.631 --> 22:22.007
Probably not.

22:26.721 --> 22:29.889
Hey, listen.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

22:31.934 --> 22:34.185
I'm sorry I lied to you.

22:34.311 --> 22:36.354
I took too much insulin on purpose.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.565
I really wanted a place to sleep.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.994
Were you ever married, Victoria?

22:52.788 --> 22:54.330
- But in the comic, it...
- No, it's comics.

22:54.457 --> 22:56.166
Comics are just made up.

22:57.168 --> 22:58.835
So who's James?

22:59.879 --> 23:03.506
Is he real, or did you make him up?

23:05.885 --> 23:07.135
He's real.

23:08.345 --> 23:10.346
Can I help you find him?

23:14.643 --> 23:17.729
Oh, the... The light's bright.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.023
It's getting brighter.

23:21.442 --> 23:23.318
Hey, take it easy. Everything's fine.

23:23.444 --> 23:25.278
Mr. Fury wants to hurt me!

23:25.404 --> 23:26.821
Please, help me!

23:27.990 --> 23:29.866
- Doctor!
- Wait, wait, wait.

23:29.992 --> 23:32.285
- Hold on, hold on.
- Please, turn off the light!

23:32.411 --> 23:34.204
Please! Oh, God!

23:35.539 --> 23:37.999
All right, hold on, Victoria.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.710
Hold on. Take it easy.
Everything's fine.

23:40.836 --> 23:42.921
- It's burning!
- Take it easy. Everything's fine.

23:43.047 --> 23:44.672
- It's burning!
- Hold on.

23:44.799 --> 23:47.675
- I'm burning!
- Take a sip, take a sip.

23:49.178 --> 23:51.846
It's poison! You gave me poison!

23:51.972 --> 23:53.014
Hold on, now.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.934
Take it easy.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.105
Hey, turn off that damn light!

24:00.231 --> 24:02.607
Help me, please!

24:02.733 --> 24:04.275
Take it easy. Take it easy.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.779
The bad guys can't get you here.
I've got you covered.

24:07.905 --> 24:10.949
But Mr. Fury's
not the bad guy.

24:11.075 --> 24:13.910
I'm the bad guy.
It's me. I'm the bad guy.

24:20.793 --> 24:23.378
It's not a tuberculoma. Can't be.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.840
I didn't know the biopsy was back.

24:26.966 --> 24:29.425
Her temperature's 105.

24:29.552 --> 24:31.261
The treatment's not working.
It's cancer.

24:31.387 --> 24:32.971
She's dying.

24:34.557 --> 24:36.224
105.

24:36.350 --> 24:37.433
Good news.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.602
It's a tuberculoma.

24:39.728 --> 24:41.563
How do you figure that?
Her temp's through the roof.

24:41.689 --> 24:45.692
The lab results from the biopsy.
It's definitely a tuberculoma.

24:48.863 --> 24:52.198
So, we're right about the diagnosis,

24:52.324 --> 24:55.952
and the treatment for
that diagnosis is killing her.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.081
Perfect.

25:00.749 --> 25:03.668
The lab checked
the biopsy again, twice.

25:03.794 --> 25:06.462
Well, a tuberculoma doesn't give you
a temperature of 105.

25:06.589 --> 25:08.840
Then it's a tuberculoma
and something else.

25:08.966 --> 25:11.009
The "something else"
is gonna melt her brain.

25:11.135 --> 25:12.385
Poach.

25:13.971 --> 25:14.846
Better metaphor.

25:14.972 --> 25:17.390
A fever that high has to be bacterial.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.017
Maybe the bowel
got nicked in the biopsy.

25:19.143 --> 25:21.311
I did the biopsy. No nick.

25:21.437 --> 25:23.563
She could have picked up
an infection on the streets.

25:23.689 --> 25:25.273
Well, she didn't have a fever
when I admitted her.

25:25.399 --> 25:27.650
The Prozac we gave her could have
triggered serotonin syndrome,

25:27.776 --> 25:29.986
- which would explain the fever.
- No, Jefferson put her on Prozac

25:30.112 --> 25:31.070
and it wasn't a problem.

25:31.197 --> 25:32.322
She probably never took it!

25:32.448 --> 25:33.948
Most likely, they saw her one time

25:34.074 --> 25:35.742
and dumped her out of the ER
with a script.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.827
- Oh, just like you were gonna do!
- Okay, you two.

25:37.953 --> 25:41.581
Grab some scalpels
and settle this like doctors.

25:41.707 --> 25:44.459
Send blood and urine cultures
and get a chest X-ray.

25:44.585 --> 25:45.919
Fine, take her off the Prozac

25:46.045 --> 25:48.296
and put her on bromocriptine
for the serotonin syndrome.

25:48.422 --> 25:50.131
Might want to get her
in an ice bath as well,

25:50.257 --> 25:53.092
assuming we want her to live long
enough to see those test results.

25:58.641 --> 26:00.808
I said I was sorry.

26:00.935 --> 26:03.603
Your fever's 105.
If we don't bring it down fast...

26:03.729 --> 26:05.730
Foreman, why are you doing this to me?

26:06.941 --> 26:08.274
I'm saving your life.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.109
No, don't make me go in there, please.

26:11.737 --> 26:13.112
Don't make me do it, please!

26:13.239 --> 26:15.490
I don't want to go!

26:15.616 --> 26:17.909
Come on. You can do this.

26:37.638 --> 26:39.138
Please!

26:42.101 --> 26:44.477
Seventeen-year-old female
presents with abrasions

26:44.603 --> 26:47.772
and apparent trauma injury
to her wrist.

26:47.898 --> 26:49.607
Dr. House?

26:49.733 --> 26:50.900
Continue.

26:52.486 --> 26:53.861
You're reading a comic book.

26:53.988 --> 26:57.865
And you're calling attention to
your bosom by wearing a low-cut top.

26:59.159 --> 27:02.495
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were having
a "state the obvious" contest.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.247
I'm competitive by nature.

27:04.373 --> 27:07.041
I thought you were supposed to
be listening to our patient histories.

27:07.167 --> 27:08.710
No, I'm supposed to be teaching you.

27:08.836 --> 27:12.463
If I can do that without listening,
more power to me.

27:12.589 --> 27:14.465
- Seventeen-year-old female...
- If this guy's supposed to

27:14.591 --> 27:16.718
have universal power over all gravity,

27:16.844 --> 27:18.594
how come his hair won't stay down?

27:18.721 --> 27:20.305
That's just stupid.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.807
She fell off her horse
while riding in the county fair.

27:22.933 --> 27:24.851
No, she didn't. She fell off the steps
of her beach house.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.228
You must have gone to the wrong room.

27:28.188 --> 27:31.107
Hard to believe that one patient
could slip past Cuddy

27:31.233 --> 27:32.984
and get herself admitted
with a sprained wrist.

27:33.110 --> 27:35.528
Two seems almost impossible.
What room?

27:35.654 --> 27:37.488
Room 2106.

27:38.866 --> 27:42.577
Patients lie,
but usually only one lie at a time.

27:42.703 --> 27:44.329
How much does she weigh?

27:44.455 --> 27:46.622
- It's her wrist, not her weight. -
Poundage, ladies.

27:46.749 --> 27:49.959
And by-the-by, what color's her nose?

27:50.085 --> 27:51.586
- She's thin.
- Flesh tone?

27:51.712 --> 27:53.629
What does this have to do
with her wrist?

27:53.756 --> 27:55.214
Almost nothing.

27:56.175 --> 27:59.719
She's either under 90 pounds
or she has a red nose. I gotta go.

27:59.845 --> 28:01.179
What's wrong with her?

28:02.598 --> 28:04.474
That would be telling.

28:05.476 --> 28:07.894
Oh, I am just too nice.

28:09.438 --> 28:11.189
It starts with "C."

28:14.109 --> 28:15.818
Urine cultures are negative.

28:15.944 --> 28:17.320
So is the chest X-ray.

28:17.446 --> 28:19.113
I assume there's a positive coming.

28:19.239 --> 28:22.033
Lumbar punctures reveal
elevated proteins and white counts.

28:22.159 --> 28:24.118
- CSF cultures?
- Still brewing.

28:24.244 --> 28:26.954
Nothing on gram stain.
It looks like meningitis.

28:27.081 --> 28:28.915
We know
it's definitely an infection,

28:29.041 --> 28:30.541
and we know where it is.

28:30.667 --> 28:33.044
Well, meningitis is nice and simple.

28:33.170 --> 28:35.880
Get her in isolation
and start her on ceftriaxone.

28:36.006 --> 28:38.508
Either she gets better, or she dies.

28:40.302 --> 28:42.637
Let me know which one happens.

28:49.186 --> 28:51.479
Oh, my God! She was sedated.

28:51.605 --> 28:52.688
It must have worn off.

28:52.815 --> 28:54.565
I did it myself a half hour ago.

28:54.691 --> 28:57.110
I'll check the nurse's station.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.070
Calendraica.

29:17.089 --> 29:19.090
She's gonna die out there.

29:22.469 --> 29:23.386
You don't walk out of a room

29:23.512 --> 29:25.471
with 10 milligrams of Haldol
in your system.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.765
- You don't walk at all.
- It was 10 milligrams!

29:27.891 --> 29:29.559
- I gave it to her.
- It doesn't matter!

29:29.685 --> 29:32.603
Bacterial meningitis.
Highly contagious.

29:32.729 --> 29:35.857
If she is out of the hospital,
we are so liable.

29:35.983 --> 29:38.860
Not to worry. She'll be dead
before she can kill anybody.

29:38.986 --> 29:40.528
Security tape confirms it.

29:40.654 --> 29:42.572
She stole some clothes and she's gone.

29:45.534 --> 29:46.659
Wrong coat.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.036
The cape's in the closet.
I had it cleaned.

29:49.163 --> 29:50.663
Funny.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.623
You gonna save her?

29:52.749 --> 29:55.209
In her comics,
Mr. Fury lives in Sloan Harbor.

29:55.335 --> 29:58.588
The night she came in, she was at
a rave at 1408 Sloan Street.

29:58.714 --> 29:59.797
You've been reading.

29:59.923 --> 30:01.174
My, how you've changed.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.676
You are a doctor.
Do what doctors do.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.553
Pick up the phone, dial 911,

30:05.679 --> 30:08.097
and a cop on the other end
does what cops do

30:08.223 --> 30:10.558
and finds the missing person.

30:11.310 --> 30:15.354
I assume the rest of you have
doctor things to do. I know you do.

30:16.356 --> 30:18.691
- Cacchi-Ricci disease.
- Do you even know what that is?

30:18.817 --> 30:20.860
Or are you just guessing everything
that starts with "C"?

30:20.986 --> 30:22.987
The kidney problems
could result in weight loss.

30:23.113 --> 30:25.239
Cacchi. C-A-C...

30:25.824 --> 30:27.408
Oh, geez, she's going alphabetically.

30:27.534 --> 30:30.369
Doctor,
why are you wearing that bird pin?

30:31.622 --> 30:33.623
It sets off my eyes.

30:33.874 --> 30:35.833
Hi, Jodi. I'm Dr. House.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.752
What brings you to the hospital?

30:37.878 --> 30:39.086
My wrist.

30:39.213 --> 30:40.630
How did that happen?

30:40.756 --> 30:41.839
I was riding the Ferris wheel,

30:41.965 --> 30:44.425
and this huge seagull flew right at me.

30:44.551 --> 30:45.635
How horrifying.

30:45.761 --> 30:49.388
I swung my arm at the bird,
but I hit the Ferris wheel.

30:51.725 --> 30:53.434
She's making it all up?

30:53.560 --> 30:55.645
No, her wrist really does hurt.

30:55.771 --> 30:56.896
I'm not lying.

30:57.022 --> 30:57.980
Of course you are.

30:58.106 --> 30:59.440
You have no idea what happened.

30:59.566 --> 31:01.067
You have no memory.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.781
Korsakoff's syndrome.

31:06.907 --> 31:09.784
Her brain is damaged by excessive
drinking or insufficient diet,

31:09.910 --> 31:11.202
pretty obviously the latter.

31:11.328 --> 31:13.663
She has no new memories,
no new ideas.

31:13.789 --> 31:15.498
Can't even process that idea.

31:15.624 --> 31:18.626
So her brain fills the gaps
as best it can using visual clues.

31:18.752 --> 31:21.504
The horse on your shirt
led her to the riding accident,

31:21.630 --> 31:25.258
and the surf scene on your clipboard
led her to the beach.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.718
"Korsakoff" doesn't start with a "C."

31:27.844 --> 31:29.512
I didn't say "C."

31:30.180 --> 31:32.765
Or did I? Lesson to be learned.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.559
Treat everybody
as if they have Korsakoff's.

31:34.685 --> 31:36.686
We all lie anyway.
Give her thiamine right away.

31:36.812 --> 31:38.604
She'll bounce back pretty quickly.

31:38.730 --> 31:41.732
And then get her to eat
some cake and ice cream.

31:41.858 --> 31:43.067
Yes?

31:43.777 --> 31:46.904
Did you need to be so cruel?
I think she's crying.

31:51.785 --> 31:54.370
Hi, Jodi. I'm Dr. House.

31:54.496 --> 31:55.663
What happened to your wrist?

31:55.789 --> 31:57.290
There was this weird old guy.

31:57.416 --> 31:58.749
He had a cane. See?

31:58.875 --> 32:00.585
It's like it never happened.

32:00.711 --> 32:02.545
Perfect forgiveness.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.134
Pulse is rapid. You got a temp?

32:08.260 --> 32:09.343
Don't know. She's warm, but...

32:09.469 --> 32:10.886
Might be something to look into.
She has meningitis.

32:11.013 --> 32:14.015
Sorry. I was more worried about her
heart blowing up. Her pulse is 150.

32:14.141 --> 32:16.142
- Rhythm regular?
- Yeah.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.185
Ready? One, two, three.

32:19.813 --> 32:22.023
- Where'd you find her?
- Battlefield State Park.

32:22.149 --> 32:23.858
- She narrow complex?
Uh-huh.

32:25.277 --> 32:28.487
She wasn't at Sloan? She was just
passed out on the grass.

32:28.614 --> 32:31.532
Foreman. I need Foreman.

32:31.658 --> 32:33.576
All right.
Supraventricular tachycardia.

32:33.702 --> 32:35.328
Get me adenosine,
one milligram, IV push.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.371
- Right away.
- Thank you.

32:46.465 --> 32:47.882
Hang in there.

32:51.637 --> 32:52.928
Her arrhythmia's stabilized.

32:53.055 --> 32:54.972
Doesn't make sense.

32:55.098 --> 32:57.266
What would push
her heart rate over 150?

32:57.392 --> 32:59.185
Dehydration? Fever?

32:59.311 --> 33:01.395
Unlikely. By themselves,
neither one would do it.

33:01.521 --> 33:03.356
We must be wrong about the meningitis.

33:03.482 --> 33:04.774
Maybe it's structural heart disease.

33:04.900 --> 33:08.194
Her heart rate dropped when you
administered the adenosine.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.029
In two seconds.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.740
It's still meningitis.

33:13.742 --> 33:16.118
If it is,
with the delay in treatment, she's...

33:16.244 --> 33:18.079
She's got almost no chance.

33:18.205 --> 33:20.206
Start the treatment.

33:22.042 --> 33:24.460
Read the report.
I found her lying on the grass.

33:24.586 --> 33:26.504
You should read my reports.

33:26.630 --> 33:28.673
I make up stuff all the time.

33:28.799 --> 33:30.633
What really happened?

33:31.760 --> 33:34.053
Well, since it's you,

33:36.056 --> 33:38.307
I found her lying on the grass.

33:41.937 --> 33:43.145
Wow.

33:43.271 --> 33:45.815
That is a great-looking gun.

33:45.941 --> 33:47.942
It's not a gun. It's a Taser.

33:48.068 --> 33:49.568
It's so cool-looking.

33:49.695 --> 33:52.905
What does it do?
Fire about 60,000 volts?

33:53.031 --> 33:56.200
At least that's what it would take
to jack someone's heart up to 150.

33:56.326 --> 33:57.993
Okay, okay.

33:59.121 --> 34:01.497
Let's just say
I tell you what happened.

34:01.623 --> 34:03.958
It stays between you and me, right?

34:05.877 --> 34:08.629
I found her lying on the grass.

34:09.589 --> 34:10.756
Fine.

34:11.341 --> 34:13.008
Don't tell me.

34:13.635 --> 34:16.887
Tell my friend, Ben Franklin.

34:17.013 --> 34:19.056
Dr. Wharton to the research lab.

34:19.182 --> 34:21.183
Dr. Wharton to the research lab.

34:23.186 --> 34:25.396
I watch a lot of cop shows.

34:32.028 --> 34:35.698
The good news is, the heart-rate thing
is not connected to her condition.

34:36.950 --> 34:38.159
Well, then she's dying,

34:38.285 --> 34:39.744
'cause the meningitis treatment
isn't helping her.

34:39.870 --> 34:42.079
She's getting worse.

34:42.205 --> 34:44.665
Well, that brings us to the bad news.

34:45.542 --> 34:47.418
The cop Tasered her.

34:47.544 --> 34:49.378
Jerk.

34:49.504 --> 34:52.006
Probably couldn't get to
his real gun fast enough.

34:52.132 --> 34:54.008
First time, he hit her in the thigh,

34:54.134 --> 34:57.344
and she just kept going,
like it was nothing.

34:57.471 --> 34:59.054
Right about here.

35:15.238 --> 35:17.323
She didn't feel the Taser.

35:24.289 --> 35:25.623
Localized numbness?

35:25.749 --> 35:27.875
Yeah, in that one spot.

35:28.001 --> 35:29.960
The diabetes?

35:30.086 --> 35:31.587
I don't think so.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.465
Well, no alcohol.

35:34.591 --> 35:36.342
Not entrapment syndrome.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.761
Can't be a vitamin deficiency.

35:39.429 --> 35:42.431
We can't chase down
every sensory neuropathy.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.103
Is that where she bit you?

35:48.230 --> 35:49.688
Yeah.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.155
What the hell!

35:59.199 --> 36:02.201
Can't get angry
if you don't feel anything.

36:07.415 --> 36:09.917
First,
there's localized numbness,

36:10.836 --> 36:12.920
then sensitivity to light,

36:13.797 --> 36:16.131
disorientation, paranoia,

36:16.258 --> 36:20.177
ineffectiveness of sedatives,
and then hydrophobia.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.430
Fear of water.

36:24.975 --> 36:26.016
Rabies.

36:27.978 --> 36:31.188
There have only been, what,
10 cases in the last 20 years?

36:31.314 --> 36:33.315
Yeah, that's because
non-homeless people,

36:33.441 --> 36:35.192
when they get bitten, they get shots.

36:35.318 --> 36:37.069
There were bats.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.544
She's dying.

36:55.589 --> 36:57.381
There's no treatment.

36:59.759 --> 37:01.635
How much time does she have?

37:01.761 --> 37:03.596
A day. Maybe two.

37:04.556 --> 37:07.600
And if you don't get your shot
in the next, say, three hours,

37:07.726 --> 37:11.061
I'm gonna have to make
another affirmative-action hire.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.024
Come on.

37:21.990 --> 37:23.657
Do it.

37:28.955 --> 37:31.123
You want me to talk to her?

37:31.917 --> 37:33.542
And say what?

37:34.085 --> 37:36.211
"There's some experimental treatment

37:36.338 --> 37:38.797
"that's not gonna work,

37:40.508 --> 37:42.885
"but don't worry,
we can make you comfortable"?

37:45.180 --> 37:46.472
Doesn't matter.

37:46.598 --> 37:50.142
Now she's gonna die in that room.

37:50.894 --> 37:53.854
Yeah. That's what you say to her.

37:53.980 --> 37:56.774
Keep that there and rest for a minute.

37:58.610 --> 38:01.236
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:01.363 --> 38:03.781
Tell House I need to go out
for about an hour.

38:03.907 --> 38:06.158
She may not have that long.

38:11.331 --> 38:13.666
I don't want her to die alone.

38:14.918 --> 38:16.919
You're going to find James.

38:17.045 --> 38:18.796
I'm gonna try.

38:28.598 --> 38:32.643
Well, I must say,
he's done a lot with the place.

38:40.068 --> 38:41.318
Hello?

39:03.550 --> 39:04.675
Hey.

39:05.468 --> 39:06.969
This is it.

39:12.767 --> 39:16.311
Man. No one's been in here
for a long time.

39:29.451 --> 39:31.452
This has gotta be James.

39:33.121 --> 39:35.456
Maybe there's another address.

39:37.917 --> 39:39.918
That's not James.

39:43.089 --> 39:46.008
Paul. Paul Furia.

39:47.302 --> 39:48.677
Mr. Fury.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.013
Her husband.

39:53.850 --> 39:55.434
Then who's James?

40:01.399 --> 40:02.775
Her kid.

40:13.995 --> 40:15.829
I just want to eat you up.

40:15.955 --> 40:17.498
You're so delicious!

40:18.958 --> 40:22.127
Look at me.
You're just like your papa.

40:22.253 --> 40:25.756
Look at you! Just like your dad.

40:25.882 --> 40:26.965
Foreman.

40:28.009 --> 40:29.093
Foreman?

40:33.473 --> 40:34.890
They're dead.

40:38.311 --> 40:40.813
That car crash two years ago...

40:42.065 --> 40:45.651
She broke her arm,
and they were killed.

40:49.906 --> 40:51.448
She was driving.

41:17.475 --> 41:18.725
James.

41:20.353 --> 41:21.478
No.

41:22.564 --> 41:24.231
It's Paul.

41:24.357 --> 41:26.024
Paul?

41:27.318 --> 41:29.736
You've come to take me.

41:31.239 --> 41:32.322
No.

41:34.367 --> 41:36.285
I've come to forgive you.

41:41.082 --> 41:42.916
It wasn't your fault.

41:47.922 --> 41:50.007
I'm so sorry.

41:50.133 --> 41:53.260
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

41:54.929 --> 41:56.263
I know.

41:58.016 --> 41:59.808
It's okay, Victoria.

42:01.269 --> 42:02.686
It's okay.

42:18.953 --> 42:20.245
Oh.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.498
You followed me?

42:24.792 --> 42:25.876
No.

42:26.961 --> 42:28.837
You were wearing rainboots today,

42:28.963 --> 42:30.797
but you were parked
in the underground garage,

42:30.924 --> 42:32.674
so the only reason
you'd need boots was

42:32.800 --> 42:35.177
if you were hitting the streets.

42:36.137 --> 42:37.846
I followed you.

42:38.306 --> 42:41.016
Didn't we have a conversation
about friendship?

42:41.142 --> 42:44.645
Yeah. I had some follow-up questions.

42:47.190 --> 42:49.650
I've met your parents and your brother.

42:49.776 --> 42:51.944
I have two brothers.

42:54.781 --> 42:56.782
- Why wouldn't you tell me?
- It wasn't relevant.

42:58.076 --> 43:01.119
- Why not?
- Because he's not in my life anymore.

43:02.747 --> 43:04.623
Well, that's relevant.

43:08.962 --> 43:11.880
This was the last place I saw him.

43:12.006 --> 43:13.882
Nine years ago.

43:17.303 --> 43:20.305
I don't even know if he's alive.
