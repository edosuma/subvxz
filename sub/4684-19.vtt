WEBVTT

00:01.700 --> 00:02.800
No, no, no.

00:02.866 --> 00:04.833
Don't touch that dial.

00:04.900 --> 00:08.033
Here's what's
on my mind tonight.

00:10.233 --> 00:11.433
Paul's got a problem.

00:11.500 --> 00:12.766
Why are you calling me here?

00:12.833 --> 00:14.433
I need to see you, Paul, now.

00:14.500 --> 00:16.733
His mistress is restless.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.900
I'm prepared to do
whatever it takes to keep you.

00:18.966 --> 00:21.400
And there's no telling
how far she'll go.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.500
I want you out of here now.

00:23.566 --> 00:24.833
Right after I tell
your wife and son

00:24.900 --> 00:26.066
about the head of their house.

00:26.133 --> 00:29.633
It looks like poor Paul
is in for a nightmare.

00:29.700 --> 00:31.333
It's not nice for married men

00:31.400 --> 00:33.100
to fool around on their wives.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.133
A Freddy's Nightmare.

00:55.100 --> 00:57.633
You're in Springwood now

00:57.700 --> 00:59.600
and you're all mine.

01:25.666 --> 01:26.933
I'm home.

01:47.833 --> 01:50.433
Jason. Jas, get down here.

01:53.633 --> 01:55.000
Have you seen this?

01:55.066 --> 01:56.466
You've been accepted
to North Carolina

01:56.533 --> 01:58.566
with a full
athletic scholarship.

01:58.633 --> 02:00.633
Yeah, I know.

02:01.600 --> 02:02.766
Congratulations, son.

02:02.833 --> 02:04.900
- Thanks, dad.
- Alright.

02:04.966 --> 02:06.466
Listen, they've enclosed
the letter of intent here

02:06.533 --> 02:07.533
are you ready to sign?

02:07.600 --> 02:09.533
Well, not really.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.533
See, I mean, I'm still thinkin'
about UCLA or Syracuse.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.900
Or maybe one
or two other colleges

02:14.966 --> 02:16.933
a little closer to home.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.766
Well, I want you and mom to be
able to see me play, right?

02:19.833 --> 02:20.866
Yeah, but don't worry
about that, son.

02:20.933 --> 02:22.033
This is your future.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.700
You have to decide
what's best for you.

02:23.766 --> 02:25.766
And you have to
decide it soon.

02:25.833 --> 02:28.233
Yeah, I know.

02:28.300 --> 02:29.400
Listen, in the meantime
you better start

02:29.466 --> 02:30.433
gettin' ready
for tonight's game.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.533
Oh, dad, I'm ready.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.466
Remember, not while
facin' the basket

02:34.533 --> 02:36.366
and don't forget
to follow through.

02:36.433 --> 02:38.266
Dad, how can I forget that?

02:38.333 --> 02:39.333
I mean, you've been
tellin' me that

02:39.400 --> 02:40.800
since I was two years old.

02:40.866 --> 02:42.200
Oh, I'll get it.

02:43.966 --> 02:45.466
'Hello?'

02:45.533 --> 02:47.466
'Uh, yeah, he's right here,
hold on a second.'

02:47.533 --> 02:49.300
'Dad, it's for you.'

02:49.366 --> 02:50.333
Oh.

02:52.966 --> 02:55.800
- Some woman named Claire.
- Okay.

02:55.866 --> 02:57.666
- Who is she?
- Just a client, son.

02:57.733 --> 02:59.200
She has a case
that's comin' to trial soon.

02:59.266 --> 03:01.300
Oh, no wonder
she sounded so nervous.

03:01.366 --> 03:03.333
- I'm goin' upstairs.
- Okay.

03:06.433 --> 03:08.000
Why are you calling me here?

03:08.066 --> 03:10.666
I called you at your office,
they said that you left early.

03:10.733 --> 03:11.900
'Why are you doing this?'

03:11.966 --> 03:13.733
Suppose Helen had
answered this phone.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.500
Well, maybe she should have.

03:15.566 --> 03:17.733
Yes, that would have been
lovely, wouldn't it?

03:17.800 --> 03:19.300
I need to see you, Paul, now.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.533
- 'I can't see you now.'
- Why not?

03:21.600 --> 03:24.533
- I just can't.
- 'Well, then tonight.'

03:24.600 --> 03:25.933
I can't see you
tonight, either.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.766
My son has a basketball
game tonight.

03:27.833 --> 03:30.100
Oh, well, we all have
our priorities.

03:30.166 --> 03:33.000
Listen, it's the city
semi-finals.

03:33.066 --> 03:35.600
'Is that supposed to
make me feel better, Paul?'

03:35.666 --> 03:38.566
I can't wait forever to see you.
This is driving me crazy.

03:38.633 --> 03:41.100
Listen, Claire, I can't talk
to you. I'll call you tomorrow.

03:41.166 --> 03:43.933
Oh, with what?
Another excuse?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.333
I'm tired of being
your mistress, Paul.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.500
You keep telling me
that you love me.

03:48.566 --> 03:50.233
When are you gonna
do something about it?

03:50.300 --> 03:51.733
Something like what?

03:51.800 --> 03:53.966
Like, get a divorce.
You said that you were going to.

03:54.033 --> 03:55.666
You promised me.

03:55.733 --> 03:58.600
Listen, now is not the time
to discuss my marriage.

03:58.666 --> 04:00.833
Well, then let's set another
time. I'm free all week.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.733
Claire, listen, I've got
to get off this phone.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.733
I will call you tomorrow.

04:05.800 --> 04:06.800
Liar.

04:15.866 --> 04:18.400
Nighty night.

04:18.466 --> 04:22.433
It's not nice for married men
to fool around on their wives.

04:22.500 --> 04:25.133
Paul better cut it off
right now.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.000
Or I will.

04:44.100 --> 04:46.100
Ah.

04:46.166 --> 04:48.100
- Let me fix this.
- Mmm, thank you.

04:49.100 --> 04:51.900
That was incredible...
as usual.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.400
Hmm, think I'm becoming
addicted to you.

04:56.200 --> 04:59.100
That could be dangerous.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.366
It's not enough
just having you

05:00.433 --> 05:03.033
on a part-time basis
anymore.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.000
Well, I told you, as soon as
Jason goes away to school

05:05.066 --> 05:07.700
I am leaving Helen for good.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.033
You promise?

05:10.100 --> 05:11.400
You don't believe me?

05:11.466 --> 05:12.933
Of course, I believe you.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.500
I just don't know
if I can wait that long.

05:15.566 --> 05:16.966
Well, you really don't
have a lot of choice

05:17.033 --> 05:19.100
in the matter right now because
I won't break up my family.

05:19.166 --> 05:21.133
As long as we're still
under the same roof.

05:22.900 --> 05:25.266
Oh, that's what
I love about you.

05:25.333 --> 05:28.133
Those strong,
old-fashioned values.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.333
Oh, yes.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.500
'Paul.'

05:35.800 --> 05:36.800
'Darling?'

05:39.666 --> 05:41.233
Paul?

05:41.300 --> 05:42.433
'Are you feeling alright?'

05:42.500 --> 05:44.433
Oh, hi, honey,
I didn't hear you come in.

05:44.500 --> 05:45.800
I noticed.

05:45.866 --> 05:47.733
I swear,
lately you've been acting

05:47.800 --> 05:49.400
like you've been
living in another world.

05:49.466 --> 05:51.033
I know, it's work.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.400
My case load
is so backed up

05:52.466 --> 05:54.300
until I think I'll be
in court everyday

05:54.366 --> 05:56.200
for the rest of the century.

05:56.266 --> 05:58.266
Well, don't you worry
I'll figure out a way

05:58.333 --> 06:01.033
to spend all of that money
that you're making.

06:01.100 --> 06:03.600
I bet you will.

06:03.666 --> 06:05.366
- You up for the game tonight?
- Are you kidding?

06:05.433 --> 06:07.366
This is the biggest game
of my life.

06:07.433 --> 06:09.466
I mean, Jason's life.

06:09.533 --> 06:11.200
- No, you don't.
- I know.

06:21.166 --> 06:23.066
When I looked up that clock
and saw that there were only

06:23.133 --> 06:25.700
two seconds to go,
I said, "No way.."

06:25.766 --> 06:27.666
I was a little worried
myself but then I saw

06:27.733 --> 06:29.200
I can get my shot off and..

06:29.266 --> 06:31.100
Oh, yeah, I knew
the ball was goin' in

06:31.166 --> 06:32.466
the moment it left your hand.

06:32.533 --> 06:34.266
Yeah, right. How could you tell?
You were afraid to look.

06:34.333 --> 06:35.533
You should've seen her, she..

06:37.200 --> 06:40.200
Well, if we beat Mayfield
tomorrow...city champs.

06:40.266 --> 06:41.500
'Well, regardless
what happens tomorrow, son'

06:41.566 --> 06:43.700
you should be very proud
of your accomplishments.

06:43.766 --> 06:45.200
You are headed
for great things, son.

06:45.266 --> 06:47.100
We're so proud of you.

06:47.166 --> 06:48.333
Yes, we are.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.233
Well, I, I guess
now's a pretty good time

06:50.300 --> 06:53.200
to let you guys in on
the decision I've made.

06:55.066 --> 06:56.900
About where you're
going to college?

06:56.966 --> 06:58.200
That's right.

06:58.266 --> 07:00.333
I'm gonna stay right here
and go to Springwood U.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.900
Oh..

07:01.966 --> 07:04.100
I talked to the coach
the other day after practice.

07:04.166 --> 07:05.933
They're offering me
a full ride.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.666
Books, tuition, expenses.

07:07.733 --> 07:09.466
Plus they're gonna
give me a good summer job.

07:09.533 --> 07:11.233
'Oh, fabulous.'

07:11.300 --> 07:13.366
But the best part
about it is..

07:13.433 --> 07:15.400
...I get to stay here
and live with you guys.

07:15.466 --> 07:17.300
Oh, Jason.

07:17.366 --> 07:19.366
Jason how can you be
so stupid?

07:19.433 --> 07:21.900
You gonna pass up
the chance of a lifetime?

07:21.966 --> 07:23.333
Throw away your dreams
of playing

07:23.400 --> 07:24.933
with one of the top schools
in the country

07:25.000 --> 07:26.700
to go to Springwood?

07:26.766 --> 07:28.600
I don't understand, son.

07:28.666 --> 07:30.833
I thought, I taught you
to shoot for the stars.

07:30.900 --> 07:33.600
Well, dad,
you went to Springwood.

07:33.666 --> 07:34.800
I mean, if it's
good enough for you

07:34.866 --> 07:35.933
why isn't it
good enough for me?

07:36.000 --> 07:38.633
Jason, this is not
making any sense, son.

07:38.700 --> 07:40.233
Can't we talk
about this later?

07:40.300 --> 07:42.800
He doesn't have to make
a decision tonight.

07:42.866 --> 07:44.600
You know, I'm really tired

07:44.666 --> 07:46.633
I think, I'm goin' to bed.

07:50.233 --> 07:51.533
Jason, wait..

07:56.700 --> 07:58.300
'I'm calling for
Mrs. Helen Woodman'

07:58.366 --> 08:00.533
'my name is Claire Endicott.'

08:00.600 --> 08:02.233
'I'm having an affair
with your husband.'

08:02.300 --> 08:04.166
'I know he hasn't told you yet.'

08:04.233 --> 08:05.833
- 'But we're deeply in love.'
- Damn.

08:15.300 --> 08:16.766
Why did you say that to him?

08:16.833 --> 08:18.800
You could be so
cruel sometimes.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.933
Listen, I'm sorry.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.500
Where are you going?

08:22.566 --> 08:23.900
The call was from
a client of mine.

08:23.966 --> 08:26.400
- He needs to see me.
- It's almost midnight.

08:26.466 --> 08:28.300
I know.
It's important.

08:29.066 --> 08:30.033
Bye.

08:37.800 --> 08:39.800
'Open this door, damn it.'

08:45.433 --> 08:47.400
Claire, what is
the matter with you?

08:47.466 --> 08:49.533
Have you totally
lost your mind?

08:49.600 --> 08:52.000
Or are you just deliberately
trying to ruin my life?

08:52.066 --> 08:55.233
You have no idea how close Helen
came to hearing this message.

08:55.300 --> 08:56.966
Don't you raise
your voice to me.

08:57.033 --> 08:58.466
No, let me explain
something to you.

08:58.533 --> 09:00.066
You will never
call my house again

09:00.133 --> 09:02.100
because our relationship
is over.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.166
Permanently.
Do you understand me?

09:04.233 --> 09:05.666
Oh, is that what you think?

09:05.733 --> 09:07.600
That you can just discard me
like I'm some slut

09:07.666 --> 09:09.466
that you picked up
off the street?

09:09.533 --> 09:12.700
I have a life too, and you
promised to be part of it.

09:12.766 --> 09:14.700
Well, I'm sorry
that I mislead you.

09:14.766 --> 09:16.733
I don't accept your apology.

09:19.766 --> 09:22.366
You don't give up, do you?

09:22.433 --> 09:24.666
You can't just use me, Paul.

09:24.733 --> 09:26.266
'I'm in love with you.'

09:26.333 --> 09:28.900
'And I'm prepared to do
whatever it takes to keep you.'

09:36.033 --> 09:37.300
Goodbye, Claire.

09:38.666 --> 09:40.200
Paul, you can't
walk out on me!

09:40.266 --> 09:41.833
Do you hear me?
You're mine!

09:41.900 --> 09:43.833
All mine!
Do you hear me?

10:15.433 --> 10:17.100
'Hey, you, um..'

10:17.166 --> 10:19.000
'Yeah, I'll meet you
there, okay.'

10:20.966 --> 10:22.600
'I'm outta here.'

10:42.666 --> 10:43.633
Oh..

10:47.133 --> 10:48.400
My leg!

10:49.300 --> 10:50.533
My leg!

10:54.700 --> 10:56.300
'Paul, what's wrong?'

10:57.700 --> 10:59.633
I was having a terrible dream.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.833
- I should say.
- Where's Jason?

11:03.900 --> 11:05.700
He's already left for school.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.766
It's late, you better
hurry up and get dressed

11:07.833 --> 11:09.733
or you'll be late for work.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.200
Hello?

11:15.233 --> 11:16.233
Hello?

11:18.866 --> 11:20.166
Hello?

11:20.233 --> 11:21.300
Who is this?

11:24.633 --> 11:26.133
They hung up.

11:38.133 --> 11:40.800
How did you get involved with
that broad in the first place?

11:40.866 --> 11:41.866
She was a client of mine.

11:41.933 --> 11:43.266
I had defended her
on a murder wrap.

11:43.333 --> 11:45.566
Now, see when we first met
there was this..

11:45.633 --> 11:47.433
intense physical attractio
which was fine.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.500
I mean, I could handle that.

11:49.566 --> 11:53.100
But, hell now, she wants me to
leave my family and marry her.

11:54.566 --> 11:55.833
I-I can't do that.

11:55.900 --> 11:58.433
She's becoming
extremely irrational.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.766
And I don't know
what she might do.

12:00.833 --> 12:02.966
I mean, I don't mind
admitting it to you.

12:03.033 --> 12:05.766
- I'm afraid.
- Hey, hey, hey..

12:05.833 --> 12:07.066
Say no more.

12:07.133 --> 12:09.300
Look, I owe you plenty.

12:09.366 --> 12:11.933
If I hadn't have a lawyer like
you I'd be doing time right now.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.133
Yeah, but can you
pull this off

12:13.200 --> 12:14.866
without the police being
able to trace it back to me?

12:14.933 --> 12:16.900
You got nothing
to worry about.

12:16.966 --> 12:18.500
I will personally see to it..

12:18.566 --> 12:20.900
that this woman never bothers
you or your family again.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.233
It's done.

12:37.300 --> 12:38.666
'Hey, you look nice.'

12:38.733 --> 12:40.066
'Thank you, darling.'

12:40.133 --> 12:41.533
Listen, Jason,
I've been doing some thinkin'

12:41.600 --> 12:42.766
and your idea about
staying here

12:42.833 --> 12:44.600
going to Springwood U.
does have some merit.

12:44.666 --> 12:46.566
'Why don't we sit down
and talk about it later?'

12:46.633 --> 12:48.300
Whatever you say, dad.

12:49.266 --> 12:50.400
What's his problem?

12:50.466 --> 12:52.433
He's been like that
ever since he got home.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.666
He's not sick
or anything is he?

12:54.733 --> 12:56.566
He's just a little shook up.

12:56.633 --> 12:58.666
He told me this afternoon
that a woman

12:58.733 --> 13:01.666
'followed him all the way
home from school.'

13:01.733 --> 13:04.566
'She drove right alongside
of him in her car'

13:04.633 --> 13:06.900
and kept asking him
if he wanted to go for a ride.

13:11.866 --> 13:12.833
Hello?

13:13.833 --> 13:15.733
Yes, he is.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.633
'Who may I say is calling?'

13:20.366 --> 13:21.500
Babe Izola.

13:24.833 --> 13:25.933
Hello?

13:26.000 --> 13:26.933
'I hate to bother you'

13:27.000 --> 13:28.233
'but I, uh, just wanted
to make sure'

13:28.300 --> 13:30.433
'you still wanted
to go through with this.'

13:41.600 --> 13:42.833
Yeah, do it.

13:45.266 --> 13:47.133
Listen and call me
as soon as it's done.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.233
'You gonna be around
for another 15, 20 minutes?'

13:49.300 --> 13:50.933
'I'm right across
from her apartment.'

13:51.000 --> 13:51.966
Yeah, I'll be here.

13:52.033 --> 13:53.700
'Talk to you then.'

13:54.933 --> 13:56.866
Let's go, dad.

13:56.933 --> 13:58.033
Hang on a second, son.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.466
What's wrong, dear?

13:59.533 --> 14:02.000
Oh, I don't know, all of a
sudden I'm not feeling so good.

14:02.066 --> 14:03.433
Oh, no.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.466
Where does it hurt?

14:04.533 --> 14:07.233
Uh, it's my head, my stomach.

14:07.300 --> 14:09.800
There's a flu bug going around
in the office, but, um..

14:09.866 --> 14:11.566
I can't believe this.

14:12.833 --> 14:14.600
Listen, I'mma go
upstairs to the bathroom

14:14.666 --> 14:16.033
why don't you take
Jason on to the game

14:16.100 --> 14:17.166
and I'll just meet
you guys there.

14:17.233 --> 14:18.500
Uh, we can wait.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.066
No, I don't want Jason
to be late for the game.

14:20.133 --> 14:21.700
Come on, I-I'll be there
by two o'clock.

14:24.433 --> 14:26.500
- Good luck, Jason.
- Thanks, dad.

14:27.933 --> 14:30.033
Helen, I'll-I'll see you
up in a jif..

14:42.166 --> 14:45.366
Oh, my God.
Now, what are you doing here?

14:45.433 --> 14:46.400
Paul..

14:47.833 --> 14:49.633
...you didn't have
to have me killed.

14:49.700 --> 14:51.366
I was gonna leave town.

14:52.866 --> 14:54.700
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.533
Hello?

15:10.600 --> 15:12.633
'Hello, dear,
how are you feeling?'

15:13.666 --> 15:14.933
'Hello?'

15:15.000 --> 15:16.966
- 'Paul?'
- Helen?

15:17.033 --> 15:19.266
I didn't recognize
your voice for a second.

15:19.333 --> 15:21.233
'Paul, are you alright?'

15:21.300 --> 15:23.400
No, um, listen I just got
out of bathroom.

15:23.466 --> 15:24.966
I-I think I'm running a fever.

15:25.033 --> 15:26.500
Listen has the game started?

15:26.566 --> 15:28.300
'It's half-time.'

15:28.366 --> 15:29.500
Half-time?

15:31.266 --> 15:32.233
Who's winning?

15:32.300 --> 15:34.466
'Tied score, 37 all.'

15:34.533 --> 15:36.766
Damn, I should be there.

15:36.833 --> 15:38.666
'I can't believe
you're still home.'

15:38.733 --> 15:40.033
'It's the city championship.'

15:40.100 --> 15:42.000
'You've waiting for this
moment all your life.'

15:42.066 --> 15:44.300
Listen, I know, hon,
I'm-I'm as sick as a dog.

15:45.133 --> 15:47.100
'If you say so..'

16:14.866 --> 16:16.933
'Hi, this is Babe.
I'm not in right now.'

16:17.000 --> 16:19.033
'But if you leave a message,
I'll call you back.'

17:33.733 --> 17:35.133
Where in the world
have you been?

17:35.200 --> 17:36.300
Did anybody phone the house?

17:36.366 --> 17:37.533
What?

17:37.600 --> 17:39.766
Paul, do you think,
you can just walk in here

17:39.833 --> 17:41.066
and ignore what I'm saying?

17:41.133 --> 17:42.400
I need to know
if anybody called?

17:42.466 --> 17:45.066
No!
Not since I've been home.

17:45.133 --> 17:47.100
'Why is that so important?'

17:49.433 --> 17:51.400
Paul, what is it with you?

17:52.866 --> 17:56.233
You're out all hours and you're
supposed to be home sick in bed.

17:56.300 --> 17:58.833
I think, I deserve some sort
of an explanation, don't you?

17:58.900 --> 18:00.233
I had to see a client.

18:00.300 --> 18:03.833
Client? What client?
What's his name?

18:03.900 --> 18:05.433
'Was it Babe Izola?'

18:05.900 --> 18:06.900
No.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.300
Look at me.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.033
Damn it! Look at me!

18:16.833 --> 18:18.633
You're in some sort
of trouble, aren't you?

18:22.433 --> 18:23.433
'Paul?'

18:25.866 --> 18:27.833
Why won't you talk to me?

18:29.333 --> 18:31.500
'Paul, we've been
married for 21 years'

18:31.566 --> 18:33.833
no matter what it is,
I'm on your side.

18:42.566 --> 18:44.533
I know you are.

18:45.866 --> 18:48.533
That's why I love you
so much.

18:48.600 --> 18:49.966
Listen everything
is gonna be fine.

18:50.033 --> 18:52.900
I just have some business
I've to work out.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.233
And I'm letting
the stress get to me.

18:55.966 --> 18:57.933
I'm sorry, honey.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.166
It's just that
I've been worried about you

19:02.233 --> 19:03.866
for the last couple of days.

19:03.933 --> 19:06.766
I know it has been
quite a grind.

19:06.833 --> 19:09.666
Oh, listen, I almost forgot.
Who won the game?

19:09.733 --> 19:11.000
- Mayfield.
- Oh.

19:11.066 --> 19:12.900
Seventy to sixty-four.

19:12.966 --> 19:15.733
Jason fouled out
in the last quarter.

19:16.866 --> 19:19.200
He was heartbroken.

19:19.266 --> 19:20.966
Yes, I noticed he wasn't
in his room when I came in

19:21.033 --> 19:22.200
Did he go out after the game?

19:22.266 --> 19:25.400
One of the cheerleaders
was having a party.

19:25.466 --> 19:27.100
So I didn't want him
sulking around the house.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.433
So I let him go.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.733
I hope, you'll be
lenient with him

19:30.800 --> 19:32.633
if he comes in a little bit
after curfew.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.733
Well, it is the last game
of the season.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.100
I just hate that it ended
on such a sour note.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.533
Oh, listen, I'm really tired.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.533
I'mma have to
get some sleep, okay?

19:42.600 --> 19:44.533
Goodnight. Love you.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.300
'Sweet dreams.'

20:26.533 --> 20:27.800
Jas?

20:29.566 --> 20:31.533
Jason, is that you, son?

20:36.366 --> 20:37.533
Hello, Paul.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.533
Damn! I want you
out of here now.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.000
Or I'm gonna call the police.

20:41.066 --> 20:43.666
Ah-ah-ah.
Let's not overreact.

20:43.733 --> 20:44.833
Besides if the police came

20:44.900 --> 20:47.000
you'd have to explain
what I'm doing here.

20:47.066 --> 20:48.800
You know, I really
don't give a damn.

20:48.866 --> 20:50.366
I want you out of here now.

20:50.433 --> 20:52.600
You don't have to
rough me up.

20:52.666 --> 20:55.000
If you want me to go.
I'll go.

20:55.066 --> 20:56.700
Right after I tell
your wife and son

20:56.766 --> 20:57.800
about the head
of their house.

20:57.866 --> 20:59.133
Oh, no, you're not
telling them anything.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.900
Do you understand me?
Out of here!

21:00.966 --> 21:02.966
Oh, yeah?
Try and stop me.

21:03.033 --> 21:04.666
- Oh, I'm gonna stop you.
- Yeah, you try..

21:04.733 --> 21:06.266
You're not telling her any..

21:06.333 --> 21:07.300
No!

21:07.366 --> 21:08.466
Let me go.

21:08.533 --> 21:09.500
- Let me go!
- No.

21:09.566 --> 21:10.600
Helen!

21:10.666 --> 21:11.633
No!

21:22.466 --> 21:23.700
Helen, no.

21:23.766 --> 21:24.866
No!

21:28.366 --> 21:30.133
Another nightmare?

21:36.366 --> 21:38.300
You wanna tell
me about it?

21:39.600 --> 21:41.533
It's not worth
going into.

21:48.133 --> 21:50.133
Where you going?

21:50.200 --> 21:52.433
Fix you some warm milk.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.433
Some warm milk for what?

21:55.166 --> 21:57.100
It'll help you sleep.

21:58.366 --> 21:59.800
I can use some myself.

22:26.166 --> 22:28.833
He's mine. Mine!

22:28.900 --> 22:30.066
All mine!

22:30.133 --> 22:31.700
- No.
- No.

22:31.766 --> 22:33.033
- No.
- Argh!

22:37.833 --> 22:38.800
You!

23:03.833 --> 23:06.733
Oh, God, no.

23:07.266 --> 23:08.233
Helen.

23:10.066 --> 23:12.533
I'm so sorry.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.733
Oh, God!
I'm so sorry.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.300
Please forgive me.

23:49.633 --> 23:50.600
Mom.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.300
I.. Mom..

24:12.500 --> 24:14.666
Aw, don't worry
about that, kid.

24:14.733 --> 24:17.100
He's gonna be alright.

24:17.166 --> 24:18.366
You know..

24:18.433 --> 24:20.733
...my old lady died
when I was a kid too.

24:22.300 --> 24:24.233
And I turned out just fine!

24:57.333 --> 25:00.133
Emergency. Heart attack.

25:00.200 --> 25:03.300
'Hello? Hello? Are you there?'

25:03.366 --> 25:06.100
'Hello? Sir, are you there?'

25:06.666 --> 25:07.600
'Hello?'

25:13.366 --> 25:14.800
Did you have a nice nap,
Mr. Woodman?

25:17.733 --> 25:19.666
Not really, Isabel.

25:19.733 --> 25:23.100
Well, I have some news that
might put you in a better mood.

25:23.900 --> 25:25.233
Really? What is it?

25:26.933 --> 25:28.700
While you were asleep

25:28.766 --> 25:30.133
your son called.

25:30.200 --> 25:31.200
Jason?

25:32.666 --> 25:34.900
Come on, Isabel, I thought
I told you to wake me.

25:34.966 --> 25:36.166
Damn it, I..
Why didn't you--

25:36.233 --> 25:38.000
Will you just pipe down?

25:38.066 --> 25:39.300
It just so happens
that he didn't

25:39.366 --> 25:41.466
wanna talk to you
over the phone.

25:41.533 --> 25:43.333
What? Why not?

25:43.400 --> 25:46.033
Well, he said that he'd rather
wait till he saw you in person.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.400
'Jason's comin' home.'

25:51.466 --> 25:53.433
'He's gonna be
taking care of you.'

25:55.800 --> 25:57.200
My son is coming home.

25:57.900 --> 25:59.100
Jason.

26:00.966 --> 26:02.866
'Why didn't you ask me first?'

26:02.933 --> 26:04.033
I didn't think that I had to.

26:04.100 --> 26:06.100
That boy is all you
ever talk about.

26:10.100 --> 26:12.033
When was the last time
you saw him?

26:12.100 --> 26:14.033
- Two years.
- Hmm.

26:14.100 --> 26:16.000
That is quite a spell.

26:16.066 --> 26:18.300
You two must have had
some falling out.

26:24.866 --> 26:25.866
- Mine!
- No!

26:36.566 --> 26:37.800
Helen.

26:50.933 --> 26:53.400
It was some falling out.

26:53.466 --> 26:55.600
Well, I can't wait
till Jason gets here.

26:56.500 --> 26:58.433
'I just love family reunions.'

27:00.566 --> 27:02.433
Oh! Krueger gets the rebound.

27:02.500 --> 27:05.200
Spins to the hoop, slam dunk!

27:05.266 --> 27:06.700
Ha-ha!

27:06.766 --> 27:09.433
Jason used to be a hell of
a basketball player.

27:09.500 --> 27:12.233
Let's see if he's still
got the touch.

27:17.933 --> 27:18.900
Two points.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.633
How you doin', dad?

27:48.700 --> 27:50.633
Not bad, son.
How about yourself?

27:52.133 --> 27:53.433
Couldn't be better.

27:55.066 --> 27:56.700
I've missed you, Jason

27:56.766 --> 27:58.966
more than you'll ever know.

27:59.033 --> 28:00.366
And I hope
that you've forgiven me

28:00.433 --> 28:01.633
for what happened
to your mother.

28:01.700 --> 28:03.600
- I just--
- Dad, listen.

28:03.666 --> 28:05.866
You don't have to explain.

28:05.933 --> 28:08.400
Does that mean, you're ready
to bury the hatchet, son?

28:08.466 --> 28:09.600
That's right, dad.

28:10.500 --> 28:12.200
That's why I come home.

28:13.833 --> 28:15.800
To bury the hatchet.

28:20.600 --> 28:23.066
'Are you deaf or something?'

28:24.200 --> 28:25.333
I'll get it.

28:32.666 --> 28:34.333
You must be Jason.

28:34.400 --> 28:36.833
I'm Isabel Caldaroni,
your father's nurse.

28:36.900 --> 28:38.800
Or I should say
former nurse.

28:38.866 --> 28:40.566
Nice to meet you, Isabel.

28:40.633 --> 28:42.033
Same here.

28:55.733 --> 28:56.866
How you doin', dad?

28:56.933 --> 28:59.033
Not bad, son.
How about yourself?

29:01.166 --> 29:02.433
It's nice to be home.

29:04.233 --> 29:06.333
'Excuse me, but I really
gotta get out of here.'

29:07.400 --> 29:09.200
Remember what I told you
on the phone.

29:09.266 --> 29:12.133
'Once he comes down
those stairs, that's it.'

29:12.200 --> 29:14.766
'He stays down here
till it's time for bed.'

29:14.833 --> 29:17.000
In his condition, walkin' up
and down those stairs

29:17.066 --> 29:18.633
is the worst thing you could do.

29:18.700 --> 29:20.266
I'll let him know everything
he need to know, Isabel.

29:20.333 --> 29:22.366
Oh, and I left a list
of recipes in the kitchen.

29:22.433 --> 29:25.000
He's on a very strict
low sodium diet.

29:25.066 --> 29:26.600
Thanks for taking care
of him, Isabel.

29:26.666 --> 29:28.566
My pleasure.

29:28.633 --> 29:30.700
'We had some good times,
Mr. Woodman, didn't we?'

29:30.766 --> 29:32.466
Not that I remember.

29:34.466 --> 29:36.233
Here is a number
where you can reach me.

29:36.300 --> 29:38.266
I'm gonna be staying
with my Aunt Nina.

29:38.333 --> 29:40.966
She broke her hip.
The poor thing.

29:41.033 --> 29:42.533
So give me a call
if you have any questions

29:42.600 --> 29:44.600
or if you just wanna talk.

29:44.666 --> 29:46.133
So long, Mr. Woodman.

29:46.200 --> 29:47.533
Bye, Isabel.

29:47.600 --> 29:49.800
Did you know that your father
cheats at solitary?

29:49.866 --> 29:51.100
Get out of here, alright?

29:53.133 --> 29:56.833
Oh, remember he just had
a very serious heart attack.

29:56.900 --> 29:58.666
Takes a while to bounce back.

29:58.733 --> 30:00.500
So go slow, okay?

30:00.566 --> 30:01.766
You got it, Isabel.

30:01.833 --> 30:03.633
Thanks again.

30:03.700 --> 30:04.933
- Ciao.
- Bye.

30:08.933 --> 30:10.800
Come here, son.
Let me take a look at you.

30:18.333 --> 30:20.766
I've been dreaming
about this day.

30:20.833 --> 30:22.266
Yeah.

30:22.333 --> 30:24.233
I've been thinking
a lot about you too, dad.

30:25.466 --> 30:27.433
Come and have a seat, son.

30:29.433 --> 30:33.400
Jason, I know you can neve
forgive me for what I did.

30:33.466 --> 30:36.166
And I'm really
not asking you to.

30:36.233 --> 30:38.266
But it's been two years
and I've been

30:38.333 --> 30:41.366
worried sick about you, son.

30:41.433 --> 30:43.500
Why did you have to go
and run away like that?

30:45.133 --> 30:47.100
And leave me all alone?

30:47.966 --> 30:49.133
I'm back now, dad.

30:50.166 --> 30:52.733
I'm gonna work everything out.

30:52.800 --> 30:53.933
Listen, I'm tired.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.766
I'm gonna go upstairs
and unpack, maybe take a nap.

30:56.833 --> 30:58.000
- Okay, son.
- Alright.

30:58.066 --> 31:00.333
Jason, what-what
are those marks on your arm?

31:01.300 --> 31:03.266
Jason?

31:03.333 --> 31:05.900
Jason, are those track marks?

31:05.966 --> 31:08.800
Jason, get back down here.

32:53.633 --> 32:55.333
I thought
you stopped doing that.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.733
I, uh, I tried, mom.

32:58.800 --> 33:01.366
But this stuff is stronger
than me, I can't stop.

33:01.433 --> 33:02.733
You don't wanna stop.

33:04.266 --> 33:05.500
'Why, Jason?'

33:07.500 --> 33:09.933
It's 'cause I miss you, mom.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.933
That's just an excuse.

33:13.100 --> 33:14.233
No, it isn't.

33:14.300 --> 33:16.233
You disappointed me, Jason.

33:17.333 --> 33:19.433
I thought I raised
a respectable young man.

33:27.566 --> 33:29.100
Wait, mom,
where are you going?

33:29.166 --> 33:30.966
Come back, mom.

33:31.033 --> 33:32.566
I need you.

33:32.633 --> 33:34.600
I'm never
coming back, Jason.

34:14.133 --> 34:15.933
Dad, you're not supposed
to be eating this stuff.

34:20.433 --> 34:22.700
Look, dad, I'm sorry
I ran up the stairs like that.

34:24.466 --> 34:25.733
I was ashamed.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.366
How do you think I felt, son?

34:29.433 --> 34:31.600
A kid like you
doesn't just get on drugs.

34:31.666 --> 34:34.566
There's always a reason.
I was that reason.

34:34.633 --> 34:36.733
'Dad, listen,
there are a lot of reasons.'

34:36.800 --> 34:38.633
I mean, I was living
on the streets.

34:39.833 --> 34:41.633
Don't blame yourself, dad.

34:41.700 --> 34:43.466
I betrayed you, son.

34:43.533 --> 34:46.733
I betrayed everybody,
including myself.

34:46.800 --> 34:49.300
Rationalizing what I did
by convincing myself

34:49.366 --> 34:51.533
that the ends
justified the means.

34:52.666 --> 34:54.833
If I bribed a judge
to win a case

34:54.900 --> 34:57.233
it was to provide
a better life for my son.

34:57.300 --> 34:59.633
'So that you wouldn't have to
struggle that way I did.'

35:01.666 --> 35:03.300
But that was a lie.

35:03.366 --> 35:06.800
Truth is...
I enjoyed cheating..

35:06.866 --> 35:09.400
'...on your mom,
as an attorney.'

35:09.466 --> 35:11.666
Hell, I even cheated at cards.

35:11.733 --> 35:13.133
Watch this.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.500
'I look at the bottom card
when I pick up the deck'

35:15.566 --> 35:18.133
'then I check
the top card like this.'

35:18.200 --> 35:20.100
'Then I can deal myself
either one of those'

35:20.166 --> 35:21.966
'or I can deal
the second card down'

35:22.033 --> 35:23.800
'like this.'

35:23.866 --> 35:27.266
'Maybe I'll take the second card
or maybe I'll deal it away'

35:27.333 --> 35:29.100
'and keep the top card
for myself.'

35:30.900 --> 35:33.700
You have no idea how much money
I made on that little jam.

35:33.766 --> 35:35.100
Easy as pie.

35:35.166 --> 35:38.433
Dad, to me you were always
the perfect father.

35:38.500 --> 35:41.100
'I mean, I never noticed
a single flaw'

35:41.166 --> 35:43.933
and it was
pretty intimidating.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.733
See, I just never thought
that I'd be able to

35:45.800 --> 35:48.333
live up to that image,
that's all, dad.

35:48.400 --> 35:51.400
It's all it was, son,
an image.

35:51.466 --> 35:54.000
I never understood
what was real in my life.

35:54.066 --> 35:56.900
You, your mom,
until you were gone.

35:58.600 --> 36:01.033
'I knew that I had destroyed
my own life, son.'

36:01.100 --> 36:03.533
'God, I held out hopes that'

36:03.600 --> 36:05.200
'in spite of not seeing you
for two years'

36:05.266 --> 36:07.433
'that I hadn't destroyed
yours also'

36:07.500 --> 36:10.100
that you can pick up the pieces
and make something of your life.

36:11.900 --> 36:14.033
When I saw those tracks
on your arm, son..

36:16.300 --> 36:18.266
...my last hope was destroyed.

36:18.333 --> 36:20.966
Dad, now, listen,
I'm not doing dope anymore.

36:21.033 --> 36:23.133
That's in the past.

36:23.200 --> 36:25.466
I've been clean now
for the last six months.

36:25.533 --> 36:27.133
And if you don't believe me
you can check with my counselor

36:27.200 --> 36:28.733
at the rehab center.

36:28.800 --> 36:30.700
'I mean, if it's one thing
I learned in therapy is'

36:30.766 --> 36:31.933
'is no matter
how hard you fall'

36:32.000 --> 36:35.300
if you, if you wanna
bounce back, you can.

36:36.933 --> 36:39.166
You think you can bounce back
from being a drug addict, son?

36:39.233 --> 36:40.400
Yeah, I mean..

36:40.466 --> 36:42.700
I know it's gonna be tough

36:42.766 --> 36:45.133
but I wouldn't be here
if I didn't believe in myself.

36:48.033 --> 36:50.033
Oh, that reminds me, uh..

36:50.100 --> 36:51.300
Would you mind
if I called Isabel

36:51.366 --> 36:54.200
and see if she can come back
after her aunt gets better?

36:54.266 --> 36:55.533
Isabel?

36:55.600 --> 36:57.200
What do we need her for?

36:57.266 --> 36:59.200
Well..

36:59.266 --> 37:01.266
In couple of weeks..

37:01.333 --> 37:04.166
...I'm gonna be
starting school again.

37:04.233 --> 37:05.900
You're going back
to college, son?

37:05.966 --> 37:08.466
- Where?
- Springwood U.

37:08.533 --> 37:10.866
The, uh, basketball coach,
he gave me a try out last week

37:10.933 --> 37:13.033
and, well, I made the team.

37:14.366 --> 37:16.266
You're gonna play
basketball again, son?

37:16.333 --> 37:18.133
Ah.

37:18.200 --> 37:19.900
One of the greatest
come backs of all time, dad.

37:19.966 --> 37:21.400
Oh, son.

37:21.466 --> 37:22.566
And don't get
too excited, dad.

37:22.633 --> 37:24.466
I mean, there's no
scholarship involved.

37:24.533 --> 37:26.033
I have to take-take
a part time job.

37:26.100 --> 37:28.100
No, don't worry about that.
I'll take care of all of that.

37:28.166 --> 37:30.000
You just concentrate
on your studies

37:30.066 --> 37:32.066
and on that jump shot.

37:32.133 --> 37:33.900
Not necessarily in that order.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.400
Oh.

37:35.466 --> 37:38.133
Well, coach set
an 11 o'clock curfew so..

37:38.200 --> 37:39.666
I better hit the sack.

37:39.733 --> 37:40.833
Goodnight, dad.

37:42.700 --> 37:43.633
Jason.

37:46.166 --> 37:47.500
I love you, son.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.833
I love you too, dad.

38:59.400 --> 39:00.600
Hello, Paul.

39:02.800 --> 39:04.266
Claire?

39:04.333 --> 39:06.533
I'll bet you never
expected to see me again.

39:07.333 --> 39:09.500
What are you doing here?

39:09.566 --> 39:11.533
I'm on assignment.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.066
Assignment?
I don't understand.

39:14.166 --> 39:15.366
It's very simple.

39:15.433 --> 39:17.433
You see, once you die

39:17.500 --> 39:20.333
you're then assigned a mate
that you have to retrieve.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.100
'I was able to manage to
persuade the man in charge

39:22.166 --> 39:23.866
'to let me choose
my own mate.'

39:23.933 --> 39:26.233
- And you choose me?
- Mm-hmm.

39:26.300 --> 39:28.166
Claire, I'm the one
that killed you.

39:28.233 --> 39:30.566
But that doesn't mean
I stopped loving you.

39:30.633 --> 39:32.266
As it turns out,
dyin' was the best thing

39:32.333 --> 39:34.266
that ever happened to me.

39:34.333 --> 39:36.666
'Come on, let's go, Paul.'

39:36.733 --> 39:38.700
Oh, you mean,
you're takin' me right now?

39:38.766 --> 39:39.700
Mm-hmm.

39:41.400 --> 39:43.433
I'm dead?

39:43.500 --> 39:45.700
You will be as soon as
you step out that door.

39:49.500 --> 39:51.133
Listen, um..

39:51.200 --> 39:52.833
...can we discuss this
a little while first, I mean

39:52.900 --> 39:56.900
how do I really know
that you're...death?

39:56.966 --> 39:58.800
Why are you
being so difficult?

39:58.866 --> 40:02.333
You just had a massive coronary,
trust me, you're dead.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.066
Then how am I standing her
now, talking to you?

40:05.133 --> 40:07.033
We'll go over all the rules
and regulations

40:07.100 --> 40:09.533
in your orientation session.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.200
Shall we?

40:11.300 --> 40:13.266
Uh..

40:13.333 --> 40:16.166
I thought you had that birth
mark removed after the trial.

40:16.233 --> 40:17.566
I did.

40:17.633 --> 40:21.033
But where we're going
you can't hide any blemishes.

40:21.100 --> 40:23.033
Can I, can I get some wate
before we leave?

40:23.100 --> 40:25.866
I'm terribly thirsty.

40:25.933 --> 40:27.433
Alright, but make it quick.

40:27.500 --> 40:28.433
Good.

40:29.566 --> 40:31.700
- Hey.
- Yeah.

40:31.766 --> 40:33.366
No tricky stuff.

40:33.433 --> 40:35.333
Can I get you
something to drink?

40:35.400 --> 40:36.533
No thanks.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.033
'You know, it feels good
us being together again.'

40:48.100 --> 40:50.100
'From now on there'll be
no more tension'

40:50.166 --> 40:53.966
no more stress,
no more calories

40:54.033 --> 40:55.600
no more Helen.

40:55.666 --> 40:59.033
Oh, Helen. What happened to her?
Where is she?

40:59.100 --> 41:01.600
Let's just say
she had a higher calling.

41:01.666 --> 41:03.566
You won't be running into her.

41:03.633 --> 41:05.266
Claire, I'm flattered
that you choose me to

41:05.333 --> 41:08.133
spend eternity with
but if you really love me

41:08.200 --> 41:10.266
you'll pick somebody else.

41:10.333 --> 41:12.333
You can't reject me
this time, Paul.

41:15.200 --> 41:18.666
I'm finally reunited
with my son

41:18.733 --> 41:21.766
after two years
and just like that, it's over?

41:21.833 --> 41:23.800
Sorry about the timing.

41:26.800 --> 41:30.100
Remember how we used to play
strip poker when we first met?

41:31.133 --> 41:33.466
And you always won?

41:33.533 --> 41:34.866
Beginners luck.

41:34.933 --> 41:37.266
I didn't mind.

41:37.333 --> 41:39.766
You turned me on.

41:39.833 --> 41:42.366
You still turn me on.

41:42.433 --> 41:44.166
What do you say
we play a hand?

41:44.233 --> 41:45.566
For old times' sake.

41:45.633 --> 41:48.400
We don't have time, Paul.

41:48.466 --> 41:50.700
What's the rush? Where we going
that's so important?

41:53.900 --> 41:56.433
Alright, one quick game.

41:56.500 --> 41:57.666
Do you have any brandy?

41:57.733 --> 41:59.100
Now, you're talking.

41:59.166 --> 42:00.700
It's in the dining room.
Help yourself.

42:10.666 --> 42:12.166
So what will it be?

42:12.233 --> 42:14.533
Little five card draw?

42:14.600 --> 42:15.866
What are we playing for?

42:15.933 --> 42:18.500
- Dealer sets the stakes.
- Okay.

42:18.566 --> 42:21.966
I win, I get to spend
another year with my son.

42:22.033 --> 42:23.766
And if I win?

42:23.833 --> 42:27.200
I'll pack my bags
and we'll be on our way. Deal?

42:27.266 --> 42:28.433
Hmm.

42:28.500 --> 42:30.633
Sorry, no.
A year is out of the question.

42:32.300 --> 42:33.933
Okay, six months.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.600
No.

42:35.666 --> 42:37.500
Three months.

42:37.566 --> 42:40.300
Alright, I'll be generous.
I'll give you a week.

42:40.366 --> 42:43.500
But you realize that I could get
in serious trouble for this?

42:43.566 --> 42:45.333
What are they gonna do,
kill you? You're already dead.

42:45.400 --> 42:47.100
Just deal the cards.

42:47.166 --> 42:48.700
Okay, one week it is.

43:03.600 --> 43:05.333
I got a hand like a foot.

43:08.166 --> 43:09.733
Give me 10s.

43:10.666 --> 43:12.600
Dealer takes one.

43:18.733 --> 43:20.800
Hate to do this
to you lover.

43:23.600 --> 43:24.800
Three Aces.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.033
'Full house.'

43:27.100 --> 43:28.133
'I win.'

43:28.200 --> 43:29.233
How did you do that?

43:29.300 --> 43:30.733
What do you mean?

43:30.800 --> 43:31.966
I guess you're just
a lucky guy.

43:32.033 --> 43:33.500
And you have to keep
your end of the bargain.

43:33.566 --> 43:35.600
I get one week.

43:35.666 --> 43:37.633
I've gotta figure out
a way to explain this.

43:40.933 --> 43:43.000
You're a sharp girl.
You'll figure something out.

43:43.066 --> 43:45.000
I'll be back
in exactly seven days.

43:45.066 --> 43:46.300
You better be here.

43:46.366 --> 43:48.200
Otherwise, things
could get ugly.

43:48.266 --> 43:50.266
I'll be here.
I promise.

43:50.333 --> 43:52.600
I've heard that before.

43:56.666 --> 43:58.066
'Help!'

44:04.400 --> 44:05.333
Jason?

44:05.900 --> 44:06.833
Jason!

44:09.900 --> 44:11.566
No!

44:11.633 --> 44:13.900
Son! Jason.

44:13.966 --> 44:15.366
'Jason.'

44:15.433 --> 44:17.033
Jason.

44:17.100 --> 44:18.133
Jason. No.

44:18.200 --> 44:20.700
Jason. Jason.

44:20.766 --> 44:21.900
Jason, please.

44:21.966 --> 44:23.800
I had to take somebody.

44:23.866 --> 44:25.833
You lying..
No!

44:31.433 --> 44:34.400
Or there would've been
hell to pay.

44:34.466 --> 44:37.100
You might be able to
cheat at cards, Paul.

44:37.166 --> 44:39.100
But you can't cheat death.

44:50.133 --> 44:51.733
Drugs.

44:51.800 --> 44:54.033
Now, there's a real nightmare.
