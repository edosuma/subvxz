THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:38.700 --> 00:39.133
IT HAS BEEN ANOTHER

FRANTIC WEEK.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.300
A NEW AND TERRIBLE HEALTH-CARE

00:43.300 --> 00:44.900

THE PRESIDENT CALLED KIM JONG UN

00:48.467 --> 00:49.400
"ROCKET MAN" AT THE U.N.

00:49.400 --> 00:49.867

01:23.033 --> 01:24.967
A FLAG MORE DISRESPECTFUL TO IT

01:24.967 --> 01:26.200
THAN GRINDING IT AGAINST

01:26.200 --> 01:28.367
YOUR GNARLED OLD BONER?

01:28.367 --> 01:30.333
BUT I'M AFRAID IT'S TRUE.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.433

01:34.433 --> 01:36.200
OVER 3 MILLION AMERICAN CITIZENS

01:36.200 --> 01:38.233
IN PUERTO RICO ARE WITHOUT POWER

01:38.233 --> 01:39.467

01:41.233 --> 01:42.467
KAEPERNICK'S OWN MOTHER,

01:42.467 --> 01:44.233
INCIDENTALLY, MAGNIFICENTLY

01:44.233 --> 01:45.667

01:45.667 --> 01:48.166
A PROUD BITCH!"

01:48.166 --> 01:54.500
AND THAT WAS ONE OF MANY

01:54.500 --> 01:55.600
EYE-CATCHING RESPONSES TO TRUMP,

01:55.600 --> 01:56.166

02:11.500 --> 02:14.233

02:14.233 --> 02:15.734
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT TRUMP

02:15.734 --> 02:16.300
DIDN'T HAVE HIS SUPPORTERS

02:16.300 --> 02:17.967

02:17.967 --> 02:19.300

02:21.433 --> 02:22.734
A CHARACTERISTICALLY CALM

02:22.734 --> 02:24.066

02:24.066 --> 02:26.700
KNEELING FOOTBALL PLAYERS.

02:31.734 --> 02:34.700
TALENT IN SPORTS AS A YOUTH,

02:34.700 --> 02:36.867
AMERICA'S ALLOWED YOU TO SHINE

02:36.867 --> 02:37.633
AND BECOME FINANCIALLY

02:37.633 --> 02:39.834
PROSPEROUS.

02:39.834 --> 02:42.200
THERE ARE SO MANY OF YOU

02:42.200 --> 02:43.533
WHO MAKE TENS OF MILLIONS

02:43.533 --> 02:45.200

02:45.200 --> 02:47.033
SHAME ON YOU.

02:47.033 --> 02:48.900
SHAME ON ALL OF YOU.

02:48.900 --> 02:51.166
>> John: WOW.

02:51.166 --> 02:51.700
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:51.700 --> 02:52.433
SHE'S RIGHT.

02:52.433 --> 02:53.367
NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR ABOUT

02:53.367 --> 02:54.300
POLITICS FROM A WILDLY

02:54.300 --> 02:55.467
SUCCESSFUL ATHLETE.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.133
YOU ONLY WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THEM

02:57.133 --> 02:58.200
FROM AN ABJECT FAILURE

02:58.200 --> 02:59.166
OF A PROSECUTOR WHO SOMEHOW

02:59.166 --> 02:59.934
LET ROBERT DURST SLIP THROUGH

02:59.934 --> 03:02.033
HER FINGERS.

03:02.033 --> 03:03.934
AND BY THE WAY, JEANINE,

03:03.934 --> 03:05.133
THERE'S A FLAG BEHIND YOU.

03:05.133 --> 03:07.533
HAVE SOME FUCKING RESPECT.

03:07.533 --> 03:09.667
BUT LET'S MOVE ON, BECAUSE I'D

03:09.667 --> 03:11.000
LIKE TO BRIEFLY FOCUS ON A PAIR

03:11.000 --> 03:12.166
OF SCANDALS CONCERNING TRUMP

03:12.166 --> 03:13.367
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS

03:13.367 --> 03:14.500
AND THEIR USE OF PLANES.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.300
AND LET'S START WITH TOM PRICE

03:16.300 --> 03:17.367
WHO, IT EMERGED THIS WEEK,

03:17.367 --> 03:18.667
HAS REPORTEDLY TAKEN AT LEAST

03:18.667 --> 03:20.400
TWO DOZEN PRIVATE PLANE TRIPS

03:20.400 --> 03:21.033
SINCE HE BECAME HEALTH

03:21.033 --> 03:22.266
SECRETARY, WHICH BY ONE ESTIMATE

03:22.266 --> 03:24.000
HAS COST TAXPAYERS MORE THAN

03:24.000 --> 03:26.333
$400,000.

03:26.333 --> 03:27.233
AND LOOK, AN OCCASIONAL PRIVATE

03:27.233 --> 03:29.000
JET FLIGHT MAY BE NECESSARY

03:29.000 --> 03:30.333
FOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.

03:30.333 --> 03:31.233
BUT FOR MANY OF THESE FLIGHTS,

03:31.233 --> 03:32.367
INCLUDING ONE TO PHILADELPHIA,

03:32.367 --> 03:34.467
IT TURNS OUT FAR LESS COSTLY

03:34.467 --> 03:36.400
ALTERNATIVES WERE AVAILABLE,

03:36.400 --> 03:37.467
AS CNN'S GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT

03:37.467 --> 03:39.900
CREATIVELY SHOWED.

03:39.900 --> 03:40.967
>> THERE WAS A COMMERCIAL FLIGHT

03:40.967 --> 03:43.467
DEPARTING JUST MINUTES EARLIER.

03:43.467 --> 03:44.834
THAT COMMERCIAL FLIGHT WOULD

03:44.834 --> 03:48.400
HAVE COST BETWEEN $500 AND $700.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.567
AND OF COURSE, THERE WAS ALSO

03:49.567 --> 03:51.500
THE OPTION OF AMTRAK.

03:51.500 --> 03:52.400
A TRAIN FROM WASHINGTON

03:52.400 --> 03:53.767
TO PHILADELPHIA, EVEN IN FIRST

03:53.767 --> 03:56.533
CLASS, WOULD'VE COST TAXPAYERS

03:56.533 --> 03:58.233
NO MORE THAN A FEW HUNDRED

03:58.233 --> 04:00.133
DOLLARS ROUND TRIP.

04:00.133 --> 04:01.400
THE SAME TRIP BY CAR WOULD'VE

04:01.400 --> 04:03.633
COST AN ESTIMATED $18

04:03.633 --> 04:07.100
IN GASOLINE EACH WAY FOR AN SUV.

04:07.100 --> 04:08.600
>> John: OH, IT GETS WORSE, CNN.

04:08.600 --> 04:09.533
PRICE COULD'VE TAKEN

04:09.533 --> 04:11.300
A GREYHOUND BUS FOR EITHER

04:11.300 --> 04:13.734
$10 OR A HANDJOB.

04:13.734 --> 04:14.900
OR HE COULD'VE JUST

04:14.900 --> 04:18.800
RAZOR SCOOTERED THERE INSTEAD.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.000
OR EVEN FIRED HIMSELF

04:20.000 --> 04:21.033
OUT OF A CANNON AND SAVED US ALL

04:21.033 --> 04:22.667
A LOT OF MONEY.

04:22.667 --> 04:24.767
AND YET, ACCORDING TO POLITICO,

04:24.767 --> 04:26.633
HE MAY'VE PAID $25,000 FOR THAT

04:26.633 --> 04:30.066
TRIP, WHICH IS DISGRACEFUL.

04:30.066 --> 04:31.333
NOT AS DISGRACEFUL AS THIS

04:31.333 --> 04:33.100
ACTUAL MUSTACHE HE USED TO HAVE.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.133
BUT STILL, ABSOLUTELY

04:34.133 --> 04:39.467
UNFORGIVABLE.

04:39.467 --> 04:40.467
LOOK AT IT.

04:40.467 --> 04:41.066
IT'S LIKE HIS UPPER LIP

04:41.066 --> 04:41.967
IS BEING HAUNTED BY THE MUSTACHE

04:41.967 --> 04:42.467
OF A SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY

04:42.467 --> 04:43.667
SEX OFFENDER.

04:43.667 --> 04:45.166
BUT FOR SHEER BRAZENNESS,

04:45.166 --> 04:46.200
PRICE HAS TO TAKE A FULLY

04:46.200 --> 04:47.066
RECLINABLE BACKSEAT TO

04:47.066 --> 04:48.400
TREASURY SECRETARY

04:52.500 --> 04:53.800

04:53.800 --> 04:55.100

04:57.734 --> 05:04.133
YOU PROBABLY RECALL THAT LAST

05:04.133 --> 05:05.166

05:05.166 --> 05:06.867
LOUISE LINTON, SEEN HERE ON HER

05:06.867 --> 05:07.600
WEDDING DAY, SILENTLY REMINDING

05:07.600 --> 05:09.533
HERSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN

05:09.533 --> 05:10.867
THAT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT

05:10.867 --> 05:13.633
SHE WANTED, STEPPED INTO A BIT

05:13.633 --> 05:14.700
OF TROUBLE WHEN SHE ACCOMPANIED

05:14.700 --> 05:15.400
HER HUSBAND ON A TRIP

05:15.400 --> 05:17.166
TO KENTUCKY.

05:17.166 --> 05:18.600
>> IT ALL STARTED WHEN LOUISE

05:18.600 --> 05:19.533
LINTON POSTED A PICTURE OF

05:19.533 --> 05:21.533
HERSELF GETTING OFF A GOVERNMENT

05:21.533 --> 05:23.567
PLANE, MENTIONING DESIGNER

05:23.567 --> 05:25.233
LABELS FROM HER OUTFIT,

05:25.233 --> 05:27.834
INCLUDING HERMES AND TOM FORD.

05:27.834 --> 05:29.500
AN OREGON WOMAN RESPONDED,

05:29.500 --> 05:31.066
"GLAD WE COULD PAY YOUR GET

05:31.066 --> 05:32.900
AWAY.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.333
#DEPLORABLE."

05:34.333 --> 05:35.734
LINTON FIRED BACK, WRITING,

05:35.734 --> 05:36.700
"PRETTY SURE THE AMOUNT WE

05:36.700 --> 05:37.967
SACRIFICE PER YEAR IS A LOT MORE

05:37.967 --> 05:40.233
THAN YOU'D BE WILLING TO

05:40.233 --> 05:41.633
SACRIFICE" AND "YOU'RE ADORABLY

05:41.633 --> 05:44.800
OUT OF TOUCH."

05:44.800 --> 05:46.166
>> John: IT'S A BIT IRONIC THAT

05:46.166 --> 05:47.800
LINTON, WHO TAGGED HER PHOTO

05:47.800 --> 05:49.600
#ValentinoRockstudheels

05:49.600 --> 05:50.367
IS CALLING SOMEONE ELSE

05:50.367 --> 05:51.567
OUT OF TOUCH.

05:51.567 --> 05:53.734
BECAUSE ROCKSTUD HEELS?

05:53.734 --> 05:55.333
REALLY, LOUISE?

05:55.333 --> 05:56.834
WHAT IS THIS, VALENTINO'S FALL

05:56.834 --> 05:59.000
2010 READY-TO-WEAR SHOW?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.367
IS THERE SOME ASYMMETRICAL

06:00.367 --> 06:01.500
PASTEL ORGANZA YOU'D LIKE

06:01.500 --> 06:02.667
TO PAIR THEM WITH?

06:02.667 --> 06:03.533
MAYBE SOMETHING FLOATY

06:03.533 --> 06:05.100
WITH A SCALLOPED HEM?

06:05.100 --> 06:06.233
OR IS IT SEVEN YEARS AGO ONLY

06:06.233 --> 06:10.433
FROM THE ANKLE DOWN?

06:10.433 --> 06:11.233
HMM?

06:11.233 --> 06:11.700
I'M JUST SAYING.

06:11.700 --> 06:12.633
IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN VALENTINO

06:12.633 --> 06:13.400
ROCKSTUD HEELS,

06:13.400 --> 06:14.667
FIRST CONGRATULATIONS,

06:14.667 --> 06:15.200
BUT IF YOU'RE CURIOUS,

06:15.200 --> 06:16.600
JUST GOOGLE IMAGE,

06:16.600 --> 06:18.166
"A STYLIST PHONES IT IN

06:18.166 --> 06:18.934
FOR A CW STAR'S RED CARPET

06:18.934 --> 06:19.467
APPEARANCE AT THE PEOPLE'S

06:19.467 --> 06:26.100
CHOICE AWARDS."

06:26.100 --> 06:27.300
YOU WILL FIND THEM.

06:27.300 --> 06:28.000
BUT THE STRANGEST PART OF

06:28.000 --> 06:29.133
LINTON'S RESPONSE CAME WHEN

06:29.133 --> 06:29.700
SHE WROTE, "DO YOU THINK THE

06:29.700 --> 06:30.834
U.S. GOVERNMENT PAID FOR OUR

06:30.834 --> 06:31.834
HONEYMOON OR PERSONAL TRAVEL?

06:31.834 --> 06:33.967
LOLOLOL."

06:33.967 --> 06:35.266
TO WHICH THE ANSWER IS,

06:35.266 --> 06:36.266
"I HADN'T ACTUALLY CONSIDERED

06:36.266 --> 06:37.300
THAT, BUT NOW THAT YOU'VE

06:37.300 --> 06:39.000
BROUGHT IT UP, YEAH,

06:39.000 --> 06:40.934
ALMOST DEFINITELY."

06:40.934 --> 06:42.100
AND GUESS WHAT WE FOUND OUT

06:42.100 --> 06:43.467
JUST LAST WEEK?

06:43.467 --> 06:44.367
>> MULTIMILLIONAIRE TREASURY

06:44.367 --> 06:46.667
SECRETARY STEVEN MNUCHIN

06:46.667 --> 06:47.834
FORMALLY REQUESTED THAT HE AND

06:47.834 --> 06:50.200
HIS NEW WIFE, LOUISE, REGULARLY

06:50.200 --> 06:51.934
SEEN IN DESIGNER CLOTHES

06:51.934 --> 06:53.934
WITH PURSES AT $10,000 PLUS,

06:53.934 --> 06:55.367
BE ALLOWED TO TRAVEL IN STYLE

06:55.367 --> 06:57.233
IN A GOVERNMENT JET ON THEIR

06:57.233 --> 07:02.333
HONEYMOON TO EUROPE.

07:02.333 --> 07:03.233
>> John: IT'S TRUE, A MAN

07:03.233 --> 07:04.000
WORTH AN ESTIMATED $300 MILLION

07:04.000 --> 07:05.166
ASKED TO USE A GOVERNMENT JET

07:05.166 --> 07:06.500
FOR HIS EUROPEAN HONEYMOON.

07:06.500 --> 07:07.567
AND THE REQUEST WAS LATER

07:07.567 --> 07:08.934
WITHDRAWN, WHICH IS GOOD,

07:08.934 --> 07:10.200
BECAUSE THAT WOULD'VE BEEN

07:10.200 --> 07:12.133
A BREATHTAKING WASTE OF MONEY.

07:12.133 --> 07:13.934
AND THAT'S REALLY SAYING

07:13.934 --> 07:15.000
SOMETHING FOR MNUCHIN,

07:15.000 --> 07:16.400
CONSIDERING HE INVESTED IN

07:16.400 --> 07:18.133
"COLLATERAL BEAUTY,"

07:18.133 --> 07:19.567
A MOVIE THAT WAS -- AND NOT A

07:19.567 --> 07:21.066
LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW THIS --

07:21.066 --> 07:23.400
A MOVIE.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.567
BUT MEANWHILE, MNUCHIN IS STILL

07:24.567 --> 07:25.867
FACING QUESTIONS OVER WHETHER HE

07:25.867 --> 07:27.100
AND HIS WIFE ARRANGED THAT TRIP

07:27.100 --> 07:28.633
TO KENTUCKY BECAUSE IT HAPPENED

07:28.633 --> 07:30.700
TO BE THE PERFECT SPOT FROM

07:30.700 --> 07:31.367
WHICH TO VIEW THE SOLAR ECLIPSE.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.333
AND LAST WEEK, MNUCHIN FIERCELY

07:33.333 --> 07:34.767
DENIED THAT AND CASUALLY

07:34.767 --> 07:36.266
INSULTED THE ENTIRE STATE

07:36.266 --> 07:38.800
OF KENTUCKY IN THE PROCESS.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.033
>> YOU KNOW, PEOPLE IN KENTUCKY

07:40.033 --> 07:42.367
TOOK THIS STUFF VERY SERIOUSLY.

07:42.367 --> 07:43.934
BEING A NEW YORKER,

07:43.934 --> 07:44.567
IN CALIFORNIA, I WAS LIKE,

07:44.567 --> 07:45.367
THE ECLIPSE.

07:45.367 --> 07:45.967
SO WE GOT THERE.

07:45.967 --> 07:46.600
I WAS LIKE, REALLY?

07:46.600 --> 07:47.233
I DON'T HAVE ANY INTEREST

07:47.233 --> 07:49.033
IN WATCHING THE ECLIPSE.

07:49.033 --> 07:49.867
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

07:49.867 --> 07:50.734
ABOUT?

07:50.734 --> 07:51.533
IT'S A FUCKING ECLIPSE,

07:51.533 --> 07:53.433
NOT A BROADWAY SHOW.

07:53.433 --> 07:55.100
"I LIVE IN MANHATTAN

07:55.100 --> 07:57.166
SO I SEE ECLIPSES ALL THE TIME.

07:57.166 --> 07:59.100
I'LL LEAVE WORK A LITTLE EARLY,

07:59.100 --> 08:00.400
GRAB A PRE-ECLIPSE DINNER

08:00.400 --> 08:04.700
AT JOE ALLEN, AND THEN GO.

08:04.700 --> 08:06.734
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO TO

08:06.734 --> 08:08.200
KENTUCKY TO SEE SOME

08:08.200 --> 08:09.533
TOURING-COMPANY ECLIPSE."

08:09.533 --> 08:10.467
AND LOOK, I KNOW MNUCHIN

08:10.467 --> 08:11.200
AND PRICE'S SCANDALS ARE NOT

08:11.200 --> 08:12.400
THE BIGGEST IN THE WORLD.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.266
FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION, THEY'RE

08:14.266 --> 08:15.633
ALMOST NOSTALGICALLY QUAINT.

08:15.633 --> 08:17.266
BUT TO QUOTE AMERICA'S

08:17.266 --> 08:18.633
LOUDEST LEGAL MIND,

08:18.633 --> 08:20.100
"AMERICA'S BEEN INCREDIBLY GOOD

08:20.100 --> 08:21.467
TO THEM.

08:21.467 --> 08:23.166
IT'S ALLOWED THEM TO SHINE

08:23.166 --> 08:24.300
AND BECOME FINANCIALLY

08:24.300 --> 08:25.367
PROSPEROUS, AND THEY'VE MADE

08:25.367 --> 08:26.900
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

08:26.900 --> 08:28.133
THEY HAVE DISGRACED

08:28.133 --> 08:29.300
THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.633
SO SHAME ON YOU.

08:31.633 --> 08:33.800
SHAME ON BOTH OF YOU."

08:33.800 --> 08:40.266
AND NOW THIS.

08:40.266 --> 08:43.300
>> Announcer: AND NOW A

08:43.300 --> 08:45.467
PREVIEW OF MEGYN KELLY'S NEW

08:45.467 --> 08:45.800
MORNING SHOW.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.433
>> IN A WORLD, IN A COUNTRY

08:48.433 --> 08:52.066
THAT'S INCREDIBLY DIVIDED RIGHT

08:52.066 --> 08:53.033
NOW.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.900
MY HOPE IS THAT THIS SHOW CAN BE

08:55.900 --> 08:57.033
A UNIFYING FORCE.

08:57.033 --> 08:58.867
>> Announcer: A LOOK AT THE

08:58.867 --> 09:00.834
UNIFYING FORCE THAT IS MEGYN

09:00.834 --> 09:01.800
KELLY.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.367
>> GAY RIGHTS ARE MORE PROTECTED

09:03.367 --> 09:05.667
AND RECOGNIZED IN THIS COUNTRY.

09:05.667 --> 09:06.667
CHRISTIAN BELIEFS ON CHRISTIAN

09:06.667 --> 09:08.100
RIGHTS, NOT SO MUCH.

09:08.100 --> 09:09.700
THIS IS ABOUT THE ATTEMPTED WAR

09:09.700 --> 09:11.533
ON THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT, NOT THE

09:11.533 --> 09:12.900
WAR ON WOMEN.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.667
FOR YOUR KIDS, SANTA IS WHITE.

09:15.667 --> 09:18.367
JESUS WAS A WHITE MAN TOO.

09:18.367 --> 09:22.800
>> THE DECISION TO DROP THE CASE

09:22.800 --> 09:29.100
AGAINST THE BLACK PANTHER CASE.

09:29.100 --> 09:31.300
KILL SOME CRACKER BABIES.

09:31.300 --> 09:33.500
DO YOU HATE WHITE PEOPLE?

09:33.500 --> 09:35.500
IS PRESIDENT OBAMA PLAYING THE

09:35.500 --> 09:36.900
RACE CARD?

09:36.900 --> 09:38.934
DO BLACK LIVES MATTER OR DO ALL

09:38.934 --> 09:40.100
LIVES MATTER?

09:40.100 --> 09:43.100
LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE FOUND FIVE

09:43.100 --> 09:44.200
PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDERS

09:44.200 --> 09:45.867
SUGGESTING BLACK LIVES MAY HAVE

09:45.867 --> 09:49.066
MORE VALUE THAN ALL LIVES.

09:49.066 --> 09:49.500
ARE THESE THUGS?

09:49.500 --> 09:51.834
THUGS IS NOT FAR OFF THE MARK.

09:51.834 --> 09:54.266
THUG MENTALITY.

09:54.266 --> 09:55.433
THAT IT'S COOL TO HATE THE COPS

09:55.433 --> 09:59.867
AND HANG OUT AND BE SOMEBODY WHO

09:59.867 --> 10:01.767
DOESN'T PRIZE BEING THERE FOR

10:01.767 --> 10:03.100
YOUR FAMILY.

10:03.100 --> 10:04.500
ILLEGALS.

10:04.500 --> 10:04.934
LATE-TERM ABORTIONS.

10:04.934 --> 10:06.500
VOTER FRAUD.

10:06.500 --> 10:06.900
WAR ON CHRISTMAS.

10:06.900 --> 10:11.700
LOOK AT THAT MORE ON.

10:11.700 --> 10:15.467
IF YOU WATCH THE VMAs, HAVE TO

10:15.467 --> 10:18.500
WONDER THEY'RE GOING TO BE

10:18.500 --> 10:19.900
OPENLY HAVING INTERCOURSE.

10:19.900 --> 10:21.567
>> WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE ROLE GOD

10:21.567 --> 10:26.300
HAS PLAYED.

10:26.300 --> 10:28.467
>> YOU SAY WHAT YOU BELIEVE.

10:28.467 --> 10:28.767
>> I DON'T.

10:28.767 --> 10:31.300
>> I DO.

10:31.300 --> 10:33.300
>> YOU ARE AN OPINION GUY.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.333
I AM A JOURNALIST.

10:36.333 --> 10:37.066
>> John: MOVING ON.

10:37.066 --> 10:38.066
TONIGHT I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU

10:38.066 --> 10:38.667
ABOUT BUSINESS, THE THING THAT

10:38.667 --> 10:39.300
EVERYONE ON "SHARK TANK" THINKS

10:39.300 --> 10:40.700
THEY A GREAT IDEA FOR,

10:40.700 --> 10:41.200
EVEN THIS GUY.

10:41.200 --> 10:41.834
>> OUR CAKES ARE MADE OF FOAM,

10:41.834 --> 10:45.867
AND THEY'RE RENTALS.

10:45.867 --> 10:47.200
>> John: WAIT.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.734
SO I CAN NEITHER HAVE MY CAKE

10:48.734 --> 10:51.066
NOR EAT IT TOO?

10:51.066 --> 10:52.033
I'M IN.

10:52.033 --> 10:53.934
HERE'S A MILLION DOLLARS.

10:53.934 --> 10:56.967
SMALL STARTUP BUSINESSES LIKE

10:56.967 --> 10:58.066
THAT HOLD A SPECIAL

10:58.066 --> 10:58.800
PLACE IN AMERICA'S HEART,

10:58.800 --> 10:59.934
AND POLITICIANS FROM ACROSS THE

10:59.934 --> 11:00.567
POLITICAL SPECTRUM LOVE TO TALK

11:00.567 --> 11:05.667
ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT THEY ARE.

11:05.667 --> 11:07.600
>> SMALL BUSINESSES ARE

11:07.600 --> 11:13.767
THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY.

11:13.767 --> 11:17.834
>> SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE

11:17.834 --> 11:21.200
BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY.

11:21.200 --> 11:21.700
>> SMALL BUSINESSES ARE

11:21.700 --> 11:26.967
THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY.

11:26.967 --> 11:30.066
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

11:30.066 --> 11:30.734
IT'S THE RARE THING

11:30.734 --> 11:31.300
EVERY POLITICIAN AGREES ON.

11:31.300 --> 11:31.934
IT'S THAT,

11:31.934 --> 11:32.400
"SUPPORT THE TROOPS,"

11:32.400 --> 11:33.133
"TED CRUZ CAN GO FUCK HIMSELF,"

11:33.133 --> 11:34.000
AND SOUTH DAKOTA SENATOR

11:34.000 --> 11:35.166
JOHN THUNE CAN GET IT.

11:35.166 --> 11:37.533
HE CAN GET IT.

11:37.533 --> 11:39.133
IT CAN FEEL LIKE WE'RE IN

11:39.133 --> 11:40.066
A GOLDEN AGE OF SMALL-BUSINESS

11:40.066 --> 11:40.667
STARTUPS, BUT THAT ISN'T

11:40.667 --> 11:41.834
ACTUALLY THE CASE.

11:41.834 --> 11:42.734
THE RATE AT WHICH NEW BUSINESSES

11:42.734 --> 11:43.533
ARE BEING CREATED HAS ACTUALLY

11:43.533 --> 11:44.367
BEEN STEADILY FALLING

11:44.367 --> 11:46.233
SINCE THE 1970s.

11:46.233 --> 11:47.333
AND I'D ARGUE ONE OF THE REASONS

11:47.333 --> 11:49.367
FOR THAT IS THAT BIG BUSINESSES

11:49.367 --> 11:51.200
HAVE BEEN GETTING EVEN BIGGER.

11:51.200 --> 11:51.967
WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR MAIN

11:51.967 --> 11:53.033
TOPIC TONIGHT,

11:53.033 --> 11:55.166
CORPORATE CONSOLIDATION.

11:55.166 --> 11:56.400
RECENT YEARS HAVE SEEN

11:56.400 --> 11:57.934
RECORD HIGHS FOR MERGERS

11:57.934 --> 12:00.133
AND ACQUISITIONS, AS YOU'D KNOW

12:00.133 --> 12:01.033
IF YOU'D EVER WATCHED THE

12:01.033 --> 12:01.467
THRILLED REACTIONS

12:01.467 --> 12:03.900
ON BUSINESS NEWS.

12:03.900 --> 12:05.667
>> M&A HAS BEEN HOT,

12:05.667 --> 12:08.266
CONTINUES TO BE HOT.

12:08.266 --> 12:10.066
>> AN EXCITING YEAR FOR M&A.

12:10.066 --> 12:10.967
>> A FEW BLOCKBUSTER DEALS

12:10.967 --> 12:11.433
BEING ANNOUNCED.

12:11.433 --> 12:12.066
THEY CALL IT MERGER MONDAY

12:12.066 --> 12:13.200
ON WALL STREET.

12:13.200 --> 12:13.767
>> IT IS SHAPING UP TO BE

12:13.767 --> 12:18.333
ANOTHER MERGER MONDAY.

12:18.333 --> 12:19.467
>> THEY DON'T CALL IT

12:19.467 --> 12:21.100
MERGER MONDAY FOR NOTHING.

12:21.100 --> 12:22.000
>> MEDIA MEGA MERGE MONDAY.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.100
MMM.

12:23.100 --> 12:23.734
>> MERGER MONDAY?

12:23.734 --> 12:24.400
AT LAST WE HAVE ONE.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.667
AND I SAY...

12:25.667 --> 12:27.900
♪ HALLELUJAH ♪

12:27.900 --> 12:29.867
>> John: OKAY, THAT'S A LITTLE

12:29.867 --> 12:31.834
NAUSEATING.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.867
BUT PRESSING A BUTTON ON TV

12:33.867 --> 12:34.700
IS DANGEROUS.

12:34.700 --> 12:35.467
BECAUSE SOMEONE COULD TAKE THAT

12:35.467 --> 12:37.166
FOOTAGE AND LOOP ANY SOUND

12:37.166 --> 12:39.367
THEY WANT UNDER THERE.

12:39.367 --> 12:40.066
OBVIOUSLY, I'M NOT IMMATURE

12:40.066 --> 12:41.533
ENOUGH TO DO THAT.

12:41.533 --> 12:42.967
BUT IF I WERE,

12:42.967 --> 12:44.633
IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS.

12:44.633 --> 12:46.934
>> MERGER MONDAY?

12:46.934 --> 12:47.533
AT LAST WE HAVE ONE.

12:47.533 --> 12:48.734

12:48.734 --> 12:57.600
[FARTING NOISE]

12:57.600 --> 13:00.166
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

13:00.166 --> 13:01.300
>> John: THE POINT IS, ALL THIS

13:01.300 --> 13:02.066
MERGER ACTIVITY HAS HELPED MAKE

13:02.066 --> 13:02.934
SOME SECTORS OF OUR ECONOMY

13:02.934 --> 13:06.066
RIDICULOUSLY CONSOLIDATED.

13:06.066 --> 13:07.200
>> THE UNITED STATES HAS GONE

13:07.200 --> 13:08.200
FROM HAVING TEN LARGE AIRLINES

13:08.200 --> 13:11.467
BACK IN 2000 TO JUST FOUR TODAY.

13:11.467 --> 13:13.166
AND THOSE FOUR MEGA AIRLINES

13:13.166 --> 13:15.567
NOW DOMINATE MORE THAN EIGHTY

13:15.567 --> 13:17.100
PERCENT OF THE U.S. MARKET.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.200
>> John: YES, WE'RE DOWN TO JUST

13:18.200 --> 13:20.200
FOUR MAJOR AIRLINE CHOICES.

13:20.200 --> 13:20.900
AND, NO, THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE

13:20.900 --> 13:21.567
JET BLUE, BECAUSE THAT'S NOT

13:21.567 --> 13:24.266
AN AIRLINE.

13:24.266 --> 13:25.867
IT'S JUST A VERY EXPENSIVE WAY

13:25.867 --> 13:27.567
TO EAT THOSE WEIRD BLUE CHIPS,

13:27.567 --> 13:29.066
WHICH ARE -- AND THIS IS TRUE --

13:29.066 --> 13:31.934
JUST SLICED GROVER ARMS.

13:31.934 --> 13:32.900
AND AIRLINES ARE JUST

13:32.900 --> 13:34.333
THE BEGINNING.

13:34.333 --> 13:34.967
THE RENTAL CAR BUSINESS IS NOW

13:34.967 --> 13:36.467
90% DOMINATED BY JUST THREE

13:36.467 --> 13:37.934
COMPANIES.

13:37.934 --> 13:39.800
THE U.S. BEER INDUSTRY

13:39.800 --> 13:40.967
IS 70% CONTROLLED BY JUST

13:40.967 --> 13:42.867
TWO COMPANIES.

13:42.867 --> 13:43.567
AND ONLINE SEARCH ENGINES ARE,

13:43.567 --> 13:45.066
OF COURSE, AS WE ALL KNOW,

13:45.066 --> 13:47.633
DOMINATED BY ONE WEBSITE.

13:47.633 --> 13:49.033
THAT'S RIGHT, SAY IT WITH ME.

13:49.033 --> 13:52.333
BING.

13:52.333 --> 13:53.300
YES, BING:

13:53.300 --> 13:53.834
THE BEST WAY TO GOOGLE

13:53.834 --> 13:55.633
SOMETHING.

13:55.633 --> 13:57.133
IN FACT, FULL DISCLOSURE.

13:57.133 --> 13:58.567
EVEN OUR OWN PARENT COMPANY,

13:58.567 --> 13:59.967
TIME WARNER, IS CURRENTLY TRYING

13:59.967 --> 14:01.300
TO MERGE WITH AT&T.

14:01.300 --> 14:02.934
WHICH MAKES THIS STORY A LITTLE

14:02.934 --> 14:05.266
DANGEROUS FOR US TO DO.

14:05.266 --> 14:07.000
ALTHOUGH THAT'S PRESUMING

14:07.000 --> 14:09.166
AT&T EXECUTIVES MANAGE TO GET

14:09.166 --> 14:10.200
THEIR SHITTY SERVICE WORKING

14:10.200 --> 14:12.266
LONG ENOUGH TO SEE IT.

14:12.266 --> 14:13.633
AT&T.

14:13.633 --> 14:14.867
IT'S THE TOP TELECOM COMPANY

14:14.867 --> 14:16.567
AROUND, ALPHABETICALLY,

14:16.567 --> 14:19.600
AND NOTHING ELSE.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.133
EVEN SOME BRANDS THAT YOU MIGHT

14:21.133 --> 14:22.967
THINK OF AS INDIE NOW HAVE

14:22.967 --> 14:24.033
MULTINATIONAL OWNERS.

14:24.033 --> 14:26.066
BURT'S BEES?

14:26.066 --> 14:27.767
IT'S NOT RUN BY A BACKWOODS

14:27.767 --> 14:29.367
BEE-FUCKER CALLED BURT.

14:29.367 --> 14:31.033
IT'S RUN BY CLOROX.

14:31.033 --> 14:32.433
TOM'S OF MAINE?

14:32.433 --> 14:33.200
THE DEODORANT WHICH DID

14:33.200 --> 14:34.600
SO LITTLE TO DEODORIZE YOUR

14:34.600 --> 14:37.000
FRESHMAN YEAR ROOMMATE?

14:37.000 --> 14:37.500
IT'S NOW OWNED BY

14:37.500 --> 14:39.567
COLGATE PALMOLIVE.

14:39.567 --> 14:41.767
AND THEN THERE'S GOOSE ISLAND.

14:41.767 --> 14:43.300
THEIR ADS FEATURE BEARDY BREWERS

14:43.300 --> 14:45.867
RUBBING HOPS ON THEIR FACES.

14:45.867 --> 14:47.000
WHAT THEY DON'T MENTION IS

14:47.000 --> 14:48.266
GOOSE ISLAND IS OWNED BY

14:48.266 --> 14:50.100
ANHEUSER-BUSCH, AND THAT FARM

14:50.100 --> 14:52.200
YOU JUST SAW IS LOCATED AT

14:52.200 --> 14:55.800
822 BUDWEISER LOOP.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.200
IT'S JUST PAST BUD LIGHT

14:57.200 --> 14:59.000
LIME-A-RITA BOULEVARD.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.333
BASICALLY, IF YOU SEE THE

15:00.333 --> 15:01.533
MASS GRAVE OF CLYDESDALE HORSES,

15:01.533 --> 15:04.367
TURN LEFT AND YOU'RE THERE.

15:04.367 --> 15:05.166
AND IT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT THE

15:05.166 --> 15:07.166
RAPID RATE OF MERGERS THAT EVEN

15:07.166 --> 15:08.367
JIM CRAMER OCCASIONALLY FINDS

15:08.367 --> 15:10.667
HIMSELF IN DISBELIEF AT ONE

15:10.667 --> 15:11.767
HAPPENING.

15:11.767 --> 15:12.867
WATCH HIM REACT TO A MEGA-MERGER

15:12.867 --> 15:15.600
IN THE ALUMINUM CAN INDUSTRY.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.667
>> BALL CORP'S ACQUISITION

15:16.667 --> 15:18.967
OF REXXAM IS TAKING THE NUMBER

15:18.967 --> 15:19.867
OF COMPETITORS IN THIS SPACE

15:19.867 --> 15:21.734
DOWN FROM -- GET THIS --

15:21.734 --> 15:26.033
FROM 3 TO 2.

15:26.033 --> 15:30.133
HOW DID THEY LET THAT HAPPEN?

15:30.133 --> 15:32.867
>> John: IT'S NOT GREAT WHEN

15:32.867 --> 15:34.100
A BUSINESS CASUAL LOUIS CK

15:34.100 --> 15:34.667
WITH A SOUND-EFFECTS BOARD

15:34.667 --> 15:35.967
IS SAYING, "HOLY SHIT,

15:35.967 --> 15:38.467
THIS WAS A REALLY BAD IDEA."

15:38.467 --> 15:39.367
BUT "HOW DID THEY LET THAT

15:39.367 --> 15:42.467
HAPPEN" IS A GOOD QUESTION,

15:42.467 --> 15:45.400
AND THE ANSWER IS INTERESTING.

15:45.400 --> 15:46.233
BECAUSE WE'VE HAD

15:46.233 --> 15:46.867
ANTITRUST LAWS ON THE BOOKS FOR

15:46.867 --> 15:48.233
MORE THAN A CENTURY.

15:48.233 --> 15:49.200
AND I'M NOT SAYING EVERY SINGLE

15:49.200 --> 15:51.000
MERGER IS BAD.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.133
SOMETIMES, BUSINESSES GETTING

15:53.133 --> 15:54.166
BIGGER CAN LEAD TO GREATER

15:54.166 --> 15:55.633
EFFICIENCIES AND IMPROVEMENTS.

15:55.633 --> 15:57.133
THE TENSION IS BETWEEN ALLOWING

15:57.133 --> 15:58.233
THAT AND PREVENTING THEM

15:58.233 --> 15:59.467
FROM DOING HARM.

15:59.467 --> 16:01.066
IT'S A BALANCE.

16:01.066 --> 16:02.533
BUT SINCE THE LATE 1970s, THAT

16:02.533 --> 16:05.200
BALANCE HAS TIPPED DECIDEDLY IN

16:05.200 --> 16:07.200
FAVOR OF BEING MERGER-FRIENDLY.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.533
WHICH HAS LED TO REAL PROBLEMS.

16:08.533 --> 16:09.133
AND LET'S START

16:09.133 --> 16:10.300
WITH THE OBVIOUS.

16:10.300 --> 16:11.533
FOR WORKERS, MERGERS CAN OFTEN

16:11.533 --> 16:13.033
MEAN BIG LAYOFFS.

16:13.033 --> 16:13.967
BUT IT'S NOT JUST EMPLOYEES THAT

16:13.967 --> 16:15.367
CAN SUFFER.

16:15.367 --> 16:16.633
CONSUMERS CAN TOO,

16:16.633 --> 16:19.467
AS JIM CRAMER EXPLAINED,

16:19.467 --> 16:20.433
IN THAT ALUMINUM CAN SEGMENT,

16:20.433 --> 16:21.433
IN AN INEXPLICABLY SARCASTIC

16:21.433 --> 16:23.567
TONE OF VOICE.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.400
>> I ALWAYS SAY COMPETITION,

16:25.400 --> 16:26.333
WHILE GREAT FOR YOU A CONSUMER,

16:26.333 --> 16:28.567
IS ANATHEMA TO PROFITS.

16:28.567 --> 16:29.500
SOMETIMES A BUSINESS WILL BE

16:29.500 --> 16:30.500
A TOTAL MONOPOLY WITH

16:30.500 --> 16:32.700
NO COMPETITION WHATSOEVER.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.066
AND WHILE THAT'S THE IDEAL,

16:34.066 --> 16:34.800
IT'S VERY RARE TO SEE A GENUINE

16:34.800 --> 16:35.633
MONOPOLY BECAUSE OF COURSE

16:35.633 --> 16:37.667
IT'S AGAINST THE LAW.

16:37.667 --> 16:38.567
WHICH BRINGS US TO THE NEXT BEST

16:38.567 --> 16:40.600
THING: AN OLIGOPOLY, WHERE

16:40.600 --> 16:41.834
A HANDFUL OF COMPANIES CONTROL

16:41.834 --> 16:43.467
AN ENTIRE INDUSTRY, COEXISTING

16:43.467 --> 16:45.567
PEACEFULLY WITHOUT MUCH IN THE

16:45.567 --> 16:49.533
WAY OF PRICE COMPETITION.

16:49.533 --> 16:51.166
>> John: THAT'S A WEIRD

16:51.166 --> 16:52.233
TONE TO USE TO DESCRIBE

16:52.233 --> 16:53.000
SOMETHING THAT'S AWFUL.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.233
"IT'S RARE TO SEE GENUINE

16:54.233 --> 16:54.967
BESTIALITY, BECAUSE OF COURSE,

16:54.967 --> 16:57.033
IT'S AGAINST THE LAW,

16:57.033 --> 16:59.700
WHICH BRINGS US TO THE NEXT BEST

16:59.700 --> 17:01.700
THING: HAVING SEX WITH A STUFFED

17:01.700 --> 17:03.166
ANIMAL WHILE LOOKING AT PICTURES

17:03.166 --> 17:06.600
OF A REAL HORSE."

17:06.600 --> 17:08.266
AND FOR A SENSE OF WHAT IT CAN

17:08.266 --> 17:09.333
LOOK LIKE WHEN "A HANDFUL OF

17:09.333 --> 17:10.800
COMPANIES COEXIST PEACEFULLY

17:10.800 --> 17:12.700
WITHOUT MUCH IN THE WAY OF PRICE

17:12.700 --> 17:13.533
COMPETITION,"

17:13.533 --> 17:14.133
JUST LOOK AT AIRLINES.

17:14.133 --> 17:16.033
IN 2012, ONE AIRLINE EXECUTIVE

17:16.033 --> 17:18.333
TOLD AN INDUSTRY CONFERENCE,

17:18.333 --> 17:19.266
CONSOLIDATION HAS ALLOWED US

17:19.266 --> 17:20.300
TO DO THINGS LIKE ANCILLARY

17:20.300 --> 17:21.867
REVENUES, WHICH IS JARGON

17:21.867 --> 17:23.767
FOR ALL THOSE FEES THAT DRIVE

17:23.767 --> 17:25.667
YOU FUCKING CRAZY.

17:25.667 --> 17:26.600
AMERICAN WAS THE FIRST MAJOR

17:26.600 --> 17:28.667
AIRLINE TO CHARGE FOR YOUR FIRST

17:28.667 --> 17:30.266
CHECKED BAG, BACK IN 2008.

17:30.266 --> 17:31.400
AND BACK THEN, PEOPLE COULDN'T

17:31.400 --> 17:33.667
BELIEVE IT.

17:33.667 --> 17:35.734
>> AMERICAN AIRLINES WILL SOON

17:35.734 --> 17:36.800
CHARGE FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR THE

17:36.800 --> 17:37.900
FIRST CHECKED BAG.

17:37.900 --> 17:40.133
THAT'S ON TOP OF A $25 FEE

17:40.133 --> 17:41.467
FOR YOUR SECOND ONE.

17:41.467 --> 17:42.467
>> $15?

17:42.467 --> 17:44.433
HOLY COW!

17:44.433 --> 17:46.533
WELL, I'LL HAVE TO PUT MY

17:46.533 --> 17:51.934
UNDERWEAR IN MY POCKETS.

17:51.934 --> 17:52.900
>> John: YES, FIRST, THAT IS

17:52.900 --> 17:54.000
A DELIGHTFUL MAN.

17:54.000 --> 17:54.700
ALTHOUGH IT DOES MAKE YOU WONDER

17:54.700 --> 17:57.100
WHETHER HE FLIES WITH

17:57.100 --> 17:57.967
BAGS FULL OF UNDERWEAR

17:57.967 --> 18:00.166
AND NOTHING ELSE.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.467
BUT WITHIN MONTHS, MOST MAJOR

18:01.467 --> 18:02.700
AIRLINES HAD FOLLOWED AMERICAN'S

18:02.700 --> 18:03.300
LEAD, AND IT WAS ESSENTIALLY

18:03.300 --> 18:05.967
THE INDUSTRY STANDARD.

18:05.967 --> 18:07.066
AND IT'S EASY FOR THAT TO HAPPEN

18:07.066 --> 18:07.767
WHEN THERE'S ONLY A HANDFUL

18:07.767 --> 18:08.900
OF BIG PLAYERS.

18:08.900 --> 18:11.200
IN FACT, SINCE THEN, THEY'VE

18:11.200 --> 18:12.200
ADDED AND INCREASED BAG FEES

18:12.200 --> 18:13.767
MULTIPLE TIMES, OFTEN MOVING IN

18:13.767 --> 18:15.867
TANDEM, WHICH IS HOW THOSE FEES

18:15.867 --> 18:17.467
HAVE GONE FROM GENERATING AROUND

18:17.467 --> 18:19.533
$540 MILLION A YEAR A DECADE

18:19.533 --> 18:23.166
AGO TO $4.2 BILLION NOW.

18:23.166 --> 18:24.467
AND THAT IS INFURIATING.

18:24.467 --> 18:25.600
AFTER ALL, IF I WANTED

18:25.600 --> 18:27.333
EXORBITANT FEES THAT KEEP

18:27.333 --> 18:28.033
GETTING RAISED ALL THE TIME

18:28.033 --> 18:29.266
DESPITE SHITTY SERVICE,

18:29.266 --> 18:38.300
I'D BECOME A CUSTOMER OF AT&T.

18:38.300 --> 18:43.100
FUCK YOU, AT&T.

18:43.100 --> 18:44.266
AND YOU MIGHT BE ANGRY WITH THE

18:44.266 --> 18:44.967
SERVICE YOU GET FROM AIRLINES,

18:44.967 --> 18:46.266
BUT THANKS TO CONSOLIDATION,

18:46.266 --> 18:47.734
THEY DON'T REALLY NEED TO GIVE

18:47.734 --> 18:50.500
A SHIT WHAT YOU THINK.

18:50.500 --> 18:51.467
DON'T BELIEVE ME?

18:51.467 --> 18:52.900
REMEMBER THAT AWFUL VIDEO THAT

18:52.900 --> 18:54.867
WENT AROUND EARLIER THIS YEAR?

18:54.867 --> 18:56.500
>> THE SHOCKING IMAGES OF

18:56.500 --> 18:57.867
A PASSENGER CAUGHT

18:57.867 --> 18:59.533
IN A TRAVEL NIGHTMARE.

18:59.533 --> 19:00.734
A MAN VISIBLY SHAKEN

19:00.734 --> 19:02.667
AS HE'S YANKED.

19:02.667 --> 19:03.934
AND THEN DRAGGED OFF A UNITED

19:03.934 --> 19:07.033
JET BY LAW ENFORCEMENT.

19:07.033 --> 19:07.700
ALL AFTER REFUSING TO GIVE UP

19:07.700 --> 19:09.266
HIS SEAT.

19:09.266 --> 19:10.333
>> John: YEAH, THAT IS THE MOST

19:10.333 --> 19:11.100
HORRIFYING THING YOU CAN

19:11.100 --> 19:13.066
POSSIBLY SEE ON AN AIRPLANE,

19:13.066 --> 19:14.133
UNLESS YOUR IN-FLIGHT MOVIE IS

19:14.133 --> 19:16.266
"THE BOSS BABY".

19:16.266 --> 19:17.700
A MOVIE THAT COMBINES THE

19:17.700 --> 19:18.533
UNBEARABLE SMUGNESS OF ALEC

19:18.533 --> 19:19.433
BALDWIN, WITH THE UNBEARABLE

19:19.433 --> 19:24.166
SMUGNESS OF A BABY.

19:24.166 --> 19:24.867
IN THE WAKE OF THAT INCIDENT,

19:24.867 --> 19:25.633
PEOPLE SAID IT WAS A PR

19:25.633 --> 19:27.400
NIGHTMARE, AND THERE WAS TALK ON

19:27.400 --> 19:28.900
TWITTER OF BOYCOTTING UNITED.

19:28.900 --> 19:30.000
THE PROBLEM IS, ON CERTAIN

19:30.000 --> 19:32.834
ROUTES, THEY'RE THE ONLY OPTION.

19:32.834 --> 19:33.967
SO A BOYCOTT'S PRETTY HARD

19:33.967 --> 19:35.400
TO PULL OFF.

19:35.400 --> 19:38.467
AND THAT'S ARGUABLY WHY THEIR

19:38.467 --> 19:39.300
CEO WAS LATER ABLE TO OPEN HIS

19:39.300 --> 19:40.734
EARNINGS CALL FOR THAT QUARTER,

19:40.734 --> 19:43.667
BY DESCRIBING A PERIOD IN WHICH

19:43.667 --> 19:44.900
I WILL REMIND YOU --

19:44.900 --> 19:45.767
A PASSENGER HAD HIS TEETH

19:45.767 --> 19:48.533
KNOCKED OUT ON ONE OF UNITED'S

19:48.533 --> 19:49.467
PLANES, LIKE THIS.

19:49.467 --> 19:50.333
>> WELCOME TO A TERRIFIC SECOND

19:50.333 --> 19:52.600
QUARTER, STRONG FINANCIAL

19:52.600 --> 19:56.867
RESULTS AND EVEN MORE INCREDIBLE

19:56.867 --> 19:58.600
OPERATIONAL RESULTS...

19:58.600 --> 19:59.934
AS YOU THINK OF OUR CUSTOMERS,

19:59.934 --> 20:00.967
I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR

20:00.967 --> 20:02.133
CONTINUED LOYALTY AND SUPPORT.

20:02.133 --> 20:03.266
WE CONTINUE TO FIND NEW AND

20:03.266 --> 20:04.934
BETTER WAYS TO SERVICE THEM AND

20:04.934 --> 20:07.433
MAKE THEM MORE COMFORTABLE ON

20:07.433 --> 20:11.934
OUR AIRLINE.

20:11.934 --> 20:12.767
>> John: IS IT ANY WONDER

20:12.767 --> 20:13.667
THEIR EARNINGS STAYED SOLID?

20:13.667 --> 20:14.900
UNITED IS SOMETIMES THE ONLY WAY

20:14.900 --> 20:17.033
TO GET TO WHERE YOU'RE GOING,

20:17.033 --> 20:19.533
WHICH EXPLAINS THEIR NEW SLOGAN:

20:19.533 --> 20:20.200
"YOU WANT TO FUCKIN' ROLLERBLADE

20:20.200 --> 20:20.834
TO HOUSTON?

20:20.834 --> 20:24.200
SHUT UP AND GET IN."

20:24.200 --> 20:26.000
AND WHEN AN INDUSTRY GETS TOO

20:26.000 --> 20:28.066
CONSOLIDATED, ANY COMPANY TRYING

20:28.066 --> 20:30.700
TO COMPETE WITH THEM OR SURVIVE

20:30.700 --> 20:31.433
IN THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN

20:31.433 --> 20:33.800
CAN GET CRUSHED.

20:33.800 --> 20:34.800
WE ALL KNOW ABOUT AMAZON,

20:34.800 --> 20:35.667
WAL-MART OR GOOGLE, BUT THERE

20:35.667 --> 20:36.800
ARE LESS OBVIOUS EXAMPLES OF

20:36.800 --> 20:38.200
THIS, TOO.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.900
TAKE EYEWEAR.

20:39.900 --> 20:40.600
IF YOU GO INTO A

20:40.600 --> 20:41.667
LENSCRAFTERS, YOU'LL SEE FRAMES

20:41.667 --> 20:42.967
FROM BRANDS LIKE

20:42.967 --> 20:44.600
PRADA, DOLCE AND GABBANA,

20:44.600 --> 20:47.266
BURBERRY AND RALPH LAUREN --

20:47.266 --> 20:48.433
ALL OF WHICH, IT TURNS OUT,

20:48.433 --> 20:49.600
ARE MADE BY AN ITALIAN COMPANY

20:49.600 --> 20:51.467
CALLED LUXOTTICA.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.367
WHO, INCIDENTALLY, ALSO OWN

20:53.367 --> 20:54.300
LENSCRAFTERS, AND

20:54.300 --> 20:55.266
SUNGLASS HUT, AND

20:55.266 --> 20:59.900
PEARLE VISION, AND RUNS

20:59.900 --> 21:00.500
TARGET OPTICAL

21:00.500 --> 21:01.266
AND SEARS OPTICAL.

21:01.266 --> 21:01.867
WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN A SMALLER

21:01.867 --> 21:03.233
COMPANY GOES UP AGAINST THEM?

21:03.233 --> 21:04.500
WELL, JUST ASK OAKLEY.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.200
>> OAKLEY WAS A BIG COMPETITOR.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.133
AND THEY HAD A FIGHT WITH

21:07.133 --> 21:08.467
LUXOTTICA.

21:08.467 --> 21:12.400
AND LUXOTTICA BASICALLY SAID,

21:12.400 --> 21:12.967
"WE'RE DROPPING YOU FROM OUR

21:12.967 --> 21:16.033
STORES.

21:16.033 --> 21:17.667
>> THEY REFUSED TO SELL THEIR

21:17.667 --> 21:19.900
GLASSES IN THEIR STORES.

21:19.900 --> 21:20.667
>> YEAH, THERE WAS A DISPUTE

21:20.667 --> 21:21.300
ABOUT PRICING, AND THEY DROPPED

21:21.300 --> 21:22.133
OAKLEY FROM THE STORES, AND

21:22.133 --> 21:22.767
OAKLEY'S STOCK PRICE COLLAPSED.

21:22.767 --> 21:23.500
>> THERE WERE SOME ISSUES

21:23.500 --> 21:27.867
BETWEEN THE TWO COMPANIES IN THE

21:27.867 --> 21:28.734
BEGINNING OF THE 2000s.

21:28.734 --> 21:32.700
BUT BOTH OF THEM UNDERSTOOD THAT

21:32.700 --> 21:34.767
IT WAS BETTER TO GO ALONG.

21:34.767 --> 21:36.066
WE MERGED WITH OAKLEY IN 2007.

21:36.066 --> 21:37.834
>> YOU BOUGHT OAKLEY.

21:37.834 --> 21:39.200
THEY TRIED TO COMPETE AND THEY

21:39.200 --> 21:40.734
LOST AND THEN YOU BOUGHT THEM.

21:40.734 --> 21:42.200
>> I UNDERSTAND YOUR THEORY,

21:42.200 --> 21:42.800
BUT THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT LIFE

21:42.800 --> 21:45.867
WAS BETTER TOGETHER.

21:45.867 --> 21:46.834
>> John: WOW.

21:46.834 --> 21:47.533
THAT IS THE MENACING TONE OF A

21:47.533 --> 21:54.033
BOND VILLAIN.

21:54.033 --> 21:56.500
THEY UNDERSTOOD LIFE WAS BETTER

21:56.500 --> 21:58.633
TOGETHER.

21:58.633 --> 22:00.900
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER

22:00.900 --> 22:06.734
FELT SORRY FOR OAKLEY,

22:06.734 --> 22:07.266
THE OFFICIAL SUNGLASSES OF

22:07.266 --> 22:07.867
GUYS WHO UNIRONICALLY USE THE

22:07.867 --> 22:08.700
TERM: "FINGERBLASTING".

22:08.700 --> 22:09.400
AND THERE'S ONE MORE VICTIM OF

22:09.400 --> 22:10.033
CONSOLIDATION YOU MAY NOT THINK

22:10.033 --> 22:10.633
ABOUT, AND THAT'S THE PRODUCTS

22:10.633 --> 22:10.934
THEMSELVES.

22:10.934 --> 22:11.500
BECAUSE HEAVILY CONSOLIDATED

22:11.500 --> 22:12.133
INDUSTRIES CAN LOSE THE

22:12.133 --> 22:14.400
INCENTIVE TO INNOVATE.

22:14.400 --> 22:17.533
AND THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THIS MAY

22:17.533 --> 22:19.433
BE THE CABLE BOX BENEATH

22:19.433 --> 22:20.500
YOUR TV.

22:20.500 --> 22:21.233
IF YOU HAVE ONE, YOU PROBABLY

22:21.233 --> 22:21.934
HATE IT.

22:21.934 --> 22:23.433
BECAUSE IT'S HUGE, GLITCHY, AND

22:23.433 --> 22:24.567
MAY BE ONE OF THE LARGEST

22:24.567 --> 22:25.900
ENERGY-CONSUMING ITEMS IN YOUR

22:25.900 --> 22:26.967
HOUSE, EVEN WHEN IT'S TURNED

22:26.967 --> 22:28.533
OFF.

22:28.533 --> 22:29.834
BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, CABLE

22:29.834 --> 22:33.100
COMPANIES HAVE NO REAL INCENTIVE

22:33.100 --> 22:34.066
TO IMPROVE THEM.

22:34.066 --> 22:35.266
THEY'RE REGIONAL MONOPOLIES.

22:35.266 --> 22:36.967
AND, AGAIN, THEY KNOW YOU HAVE

22:36.967 --> 22:38.734
NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

22:38.734 --> 22:39.667
AND YOU CAN'T EVEN SMASH YOUR

22:39.667 --> 22:41.767
CABLE BOX OUT OF FRUSTRATION,

22:41.767 --> 22:43.200
BECAUSE YOU'RE RENTING IT, AND

22:43.200 --> 22:44.300
THEY'LL CHARGE YOU HUNDREDS OF

22:44.300 --> 22:45.300
DOLLARS IF YOU DON'T GIVE IT

22:45.300 --> 22:46.600
BACK.

22:46.600 --> 22:47.934
WHICH IS WHY WE WENT TO THE

22:47.934 --> 22:49.033
TROUBLE OF BLOWING THIS ONE UP

22:49.033 --> 22:54.867
FOR YOU.

22:54.867 --> 22:57.867
TAKE A LOOK.

22:57.867 --> 22:58.500
PRETTY CATHARTIC TO WATCH,

22:58.500 --> 23:02.066
RIGHT?

23:02.066 --> 23:03.433
I HOPE THAT HELPS.

23:03.433 --> 23:04.066
FEEL FREE TO WATCH IT AGAIN IN

23:04.066 --> 23:17.300
SLOW MOTION.

23:17.300 --> 23:19.133
I WANT YOU TO KNOW: IT SUFFERED.

23:19.133 --> 23:20.767
THE POINT HERE IS, WE SEEM TO

23:20.767 --> 23:22.500
HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW IMPORTANT

23:22.500 --> 23:24.567
ANTITRUST IS, AND ARE ALL NOW

23:24.567 --> 23:25.166
BEING FORCED TO LIVE WITH THE

23:25.166 --> 23:27.033
CONSEQUENCES.

23:27.033 --> 23:28.333
BECAUSE THIS ISSUE AFFECTS

23:28.333 --> 23:30.000
ALMOST EVERYTHING YOU DO.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.300
ANGRY AT BANKS?

23:31.300 --> 23:32.367
THE INDUSTRY IS DOMINATED BY

23:32.367 --> 23:33.967
JUST THESE FOUR.

23:33.967 --> 23:34.700
FRUSTRATED WITH YOUR HEALTH

23:34.700 --> 23:35.967
INSURANCE PROVIDER?

23:35.967 --> 23:38.033
ODDS ARE, IT'S ONE OF THESE.

23:38.033 --> 23:38.967
AND IF THIS WHOLE STORY IS

23:38.967 --> 23:41.233
INFURIATING YOU SO MUCH YOU'RE

23:41.233 --> 23:42.433
YEARNING FOR THE SWEET ESCAPE

23:42.433 --> 23:43.800
OF DEATH, WELL, BAD LUCK.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.133
THE CASKET INDUSTRY IS

23:45.133 --> 23:46.266
CONTROLLED BY

23:46.266 --> 23:48.433
THESE THREE COMPANIES.

23:48.433 --> 23:50.600
OH, AND IT GETS EVEN WORSE:

23:50.600 --> 23:54.000
THE AFTERLIFE IS ACTUALLY

23:54.000 --> 23:55.533
CONTROLLED BY ONE RELIGION.

23:55.533 --> 23:56.133
I'M NOT SAYING WHICH ONE, BUT

23:56.133 --> 23:59.066
WHEN YOU FIND OUT, YOU ARE GONNA

23:59.066 --> 24:01.200
BE SO MAD!

24:01.200 --> 24:03.100
THE POINT IS, WE HAVE LAWS TO

24:03.100 --> 24:05.400
PREVENT THE WORST EFFECTS OF

24:05.400 --> 24:07.066
CONSOLIDATION.

24:07.066 --> 24:09.166
AND IT MAY BE TIME TO USE THEM

24:09.166 --> 24:10.700
TO IMPOSE STRICTER STANDARDS,

24:10.700 --> 24:18.633
AND EMPOWER THE

24:18.633 --> 24:22.166
FTC AND DOJ ANTITRUST DIVISIONS.

24:22.166 --> 24:22.834
WHICH IS SOMETHING MOST PEOPLE

24:22.834 --> 24:23.400
WOULD GET BEHIND, AND NEARLY

24:23.400 --> 24:23.900
EVERY POLITICIAN SHOULD.

24:23.900 --> 24:28.800
AFTER ALL, THERE'S ONE THING

24:28.800 --> 24:30.100
THEY CAN'T STOP SAYING

24:30.100 --> 24:30.667
WELL, IF THEY REALLY BELIEVE

24:30.667 --> 24:31.300
THAT, IT MAY BE TIME FOR THEM TO

24:31.300 --> 24:33.934
STOP TALKING ABOUT BACKBONES,

24:33.934 --> 24:35.633
AND ACTUALLY FUCKING GROW ONE.

24:35.633 --> 24:41.033
AND NOW THIS.

24:41.033 --> 24:44.266
>> Announcer: AND NOW ALL OF

24:44.266 --> 24:46.300
JIM CRAMER'S SOUND BUTTONS

24:46.300 --> 24:49.667
REPLACED WITH FART NOISES.

24:49.667 --> 24:54.367
>> THERE AFTER RAISE MONEY TO

24:54.367 --> 24:57.266
PAY BACK THEIR UNHAPPY CLIENTS.

24:57.266 --> 25:08.867
THINGS KEEP WORKING OUT.

25:08.867 --> 25:13.266
BUY HIGH AND THEN SELL LOW.

25:13.266 --> 25:18.834
A TIME-HONORED WAY TO LOSE MONEY

25:18.834 --> 25:20.700
MONEY.

25:20.700 --> 25:29.100
I WANT YOU FEEL EMBOLDENED.

25:29.100 --> 25:32.266
I WAS WRONG ON BOTH COUNTS.

25:32.266 --> 25:35.467
[FART NOISES]

25:35.467 --> 25:37.667
>> John: FINALLY TONIGHT,

25:37.667 --> 25:38.367
A QUICK WORD REGARDING

25:38.367 --> 25:40.433
TRAINS.

25:40.433 --> 25:42.233
BASICALLY, BUSES THAT FUCK.

25:42.233 --> 25:43.033
YOU PROBABLY KNOW THAT WE

25:43.033 --> 25:46.800
RECENTLY BECAME OBSESSED WITH

25:46.800 --> 25:48.734
WNEP SCRANTON'S BACKYARD TRAIN

25:48.734 --> 25:51.500
THAT RUNS BEHIND THEIR WEATHER

25:51.500 --> 25:54.600
FORECASTS.

25:54.600 --> 25:55.667
ON OUR LAST PROGRAM, WE ACTUALLY

25:55.667 --> 25:56.533
MADE THEM A RIDICULOUSLY LARGE

25:56.533 --> 25:57.300
TRAIN SET, AND ENDED THE SHOW

25:57.300 --> 26:01.266
WITH THIS PLEA:

26:01.266 --> 26:02.100
PLEASE WNEP -- CALL US TO

26:02.100 --> 26:03.333
ARRANGE PICKUP OR DELIVERY OF

26:03.333 --> 26:06.367
THE GREATEST BACKYARD TRAIN THE

26:06.367 --> 26:10.734
LOCAL NEWS HAS EVER SEEN.

26:10.734 --> 26:14.300
IT'S TRUE.

26:14.300 --> 26:15.000
WE BUILT THEM AN ENORMOUS TRAIN

26:15.000 --> 26:15.934
SET AND THEN DEMANDED THEY DRIVE

26:15.934 --> 26:16.600
TWO AND A HALF HOURS TO COME GET

26:16.600 --> 26:16.800
IT.

26:16.800 --> 26:17.934
WHICH IS BASICALLY THE WORLD'S

26:17.934 --> 26:22.066
WORST GIFT, RIGHT AFTER GIVING

26:22.066 --> 26:22.734
SOMEONE A PLANT.

26:22.734 --> 26:23.200
THAT'S NOT A PRESENT.

26:23.200 --> 26:24.467
IT'S AN ASSIGNMENT.

26:24.467 --> 26:25.200
AND IN CLASSIC SCRANTON STYLE,

26:25.200 --> 26:28.266
VIEWERS WERE SPLIT ON THE ISSUE

26:28.266 --> 26:29.367
OF THE NEW TRAIN.

26:29.367 --> 26:30.200
SOME, LIKE THIS ONE, WERE

26:30.200 --> 26:30.900
POSITIVE:

26:30.900 --> 26:32.333
>> YOU HAVE GOT TO GO GET THAT,

26:32.333 --> 26:34.233
THAT TRAIN, THAT, THAT BEAUTIFUL

26:34.233 --> 26:35.734
TRAIN FOR THE BACKYARD THAT HBO

26:35.734 --> 26:38.633
MADE.

26:38.633 --> 26:39.433
YOUR LITTLE ONE, I CAN'T EVEN

26:39.433 --> 26:44.934
LOOK AT IT NOW.

26:44.934 --> 26:50.000
>> John: COME ON.

26:50.000 --> 26:50.967
THERE'S NO NEED TO MAKE THIS

26:50.967 --> 26:52.734
ABOUT HOW SHITTY.

26:52.734 --> 26:53.233
YOUR WORDS --

26:53.233 --> 26:54.367
THE REGULAR BACKYARD TRAIN IS.

26:54.367 --> 26:55.000
AND HEY, TO BE FAIR: NOT

26:55.000 --> 26:56.066
EVERYONE LIKED OURS, EITHER.

26:56.066 --> 26:57.100
>> I WON'T LET SOME NEW YORK BIG

26:57.100 --> 26:59.567
SHOT COME AND GIVE THAT BIG,

26:59.567 --> 27:01.233
FANCY TRAIN.

27:01.233 --> 27:02.333
THE HECKS WITH THEM NEW YORK

27:02.333 --> 27:03.367
FELLOWS THERE.

27:03.367 --> 27:05.867
WHAT DO THEY KNOW ABOUT TRAINS

27:05.867 --> 27:06.834
ANYWAY?

27:06.834 --> 27:07.767
>> John: YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:07.767 --> 27:08.934
THAT MAN HAS A POINT.

27:08.934 --> 27:09.533
THE SUBWAY PROVES NEW YORKERS

27:09.533 --> 27:11.467
KNOW NOTHING ABOUT TRAINS.

27:11.467 --> 27:13.033
SUBWAY TRAINS ARE BASICALLY JUST

27:13.033 --> 27:14.433
ELONGATED DUMPSTERS WITH SEATS

27:14.433 --> 27:15.567
THAT SLOWLY ROLL THROUGH

27:15.567 --> 27:18.800
RAT-INFESTED SADNESS TUNNELS.

27:18.800 --> 27:19.834
BUT THOSE ANGRY CALLERS ACTUALLY

27:19.834 --> 27:25.200
GOT THEIR WISH, BECAUSE, SADLY,

27:25.200 --> 27:26.133
OUR TRAIN SET WON'T BE REPLACING

27:26.133 --> 27:26.800
THEIR BACKYARD TRAIN, FOR THE

27:26.800 --> 27:27.400
SIMPLE REASON THAT IT DOESN'T

27:27.400 --> 27:29.133
FIT IN THEIR BACKYARD.

27:29.133 --> 27:31.633
WHICH, TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST,

27:31.633 --> 27:32.800
WE KIND OF THOUGHT MIGHT BE

27:32.800 --> 27:34.367
THE CASE.

27:34.367 --> 27:35.300
WE DID THINK ABOUT THE

27:35.300 --> 27:36.400
LOGISTICS, IT'S JUST WE DECIDED

27:36.400 --> 27:37.233
IT WOULD BE FUNNIER TO GIVE THEM

27:37.233 --> 27:38.834
A REALLY BIG TRAIN.

27:38.834 --> 27:40.633
IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

27:40.633 --> 27:48.200
WE'RE JUST TERRIBLE PEOPLE.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.066
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS, WNEP HAVE

27:50.066 --> 27:50.700
DONATED OUR TRAIN SET TO

27:50.700 --> 27:51.166
SCRANTON'S LOCAL

27:51.166 --> 27:55.100
ELECTRIC CITY TROLLEY MUSEUM.

27:55.100 --> 27:55.767
OR AS IT'S KNOWN TO THE CHILDREN

27:55.767 --> 27:56.333
OF SCRANTON, "EVERY FUCKING

27:56.333 --> 27:57.567
YEAR'S CLASS TRIP."

27:57.567 --> 27:58.133
AND THEY WENT ALL-OUT, EVEN

27:58.133 --> 27:58.700
USING -- AND THIS IS TRUE --

27:58.700 --> 28:00.300
A POLICE ESCORT TO BRING OUR

28:00.300 --> 28:02.333
TRAIN SET THROUGH SCRANTON.

28:02.333 --> 28:03.500
JUST TO BE CLEAR.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.500
THEY TOOK A TRAIN, LOADED IT IN

28:05.500 --> 28:06.967
A TRUCK, AND THEN SURROUNDED IT

28:06.967 --> 28:08.667
WITH CARS.

28:08.667 --> 28:09.533
SO THEY WEREN'T SO MUCH "GOING"

28:09.533 --> 28:10.734
TO A TRANSPORTATION MUSEUM AS

28:10.734 --> 28:12.767
"BECOMING" ONE.

28:12.767 --> 28:14.066
AND ON FRIDAY, THEY CELEBRATED

28:14.066 --> 28:16.367
THE BIG UNVEILING.

28:16.367 --> 28:18.000
>> NOW THAT IRRESPONSIBLY LARGE

28:18.000 --> 28:20.867
TRAIN IS IN DISPLAY IN SCRANTON

28:20.867 --> 28:22.300
FOR ALL TO SEE.

28:22.300 --> 28:23.166
JOHN OLIVER, THE HOST OF LAST

28:23.166 --> 28:23.900
WEEK TONIGHT, COULD NOT MAKE IT

28:23.900 --> 28:25.066
TO TODAY'S DEDICATION, BUT WE

28:25.066 --> 28:28.667
WERE HONORED WITH THE PRESENCE

28:28.667 --> 28:29.800
OF TWO OF THE SHOW'S CHARACTERS:

28:29.800 --> 28:30.767
MR. NUTTERBUTTER HIMSELF AND THE

28:30.767 --> 28:31.500
DANCING ZEBRA WERE BOTH ON HAND

28:31.500 --> 28:32.433
TO TAKE IN PART OF TODAY'S

28:32.433 --> 28:34.233
FESTIVITIES.

28:34.233 --> 28:35.500
>> John: IT'S TRUE!

28:35.500 --> 28:38.166
I COULDN'T MAKE IT TO THE EVENT,

28:38.166 --> 28:42.300
BECAUSE I HAVE TO WORK ALL WEEK

28:42.300 --> 28:43.467
TO MAKE THIS SHOW

28:43.467 --> 28:45.367
"STEPHEN AND JIMMY."

28:45.367 --> 28:47.000
BUT WE DID SEND OUR FAVORITE

28:47.000 --> 28:47.633
NATURALLY OCCURRING BARCODE --

28:47.633 --> 28:48.800
THE BOLIVIAN ZEBRA.

28:48.800 --> 28:50.100
AND MR. NUTTERBUTTER, AMERICA'S

28:50.100 --> 28:51.800
FURRIEST CO-DEFENDANT.

28:51.800 --> 28:52.967
BUT LOOK, THIS WHOLE TRAIN

28:52.967 --> 28:56.166
ADVENTURE HAS BEEN A LOT OF FUN,

28:56.166 --> 28:57.834
AND I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE

28:57.834 --> 28:59.200
OF SCRANTON, BECAUSE IT TURNS

28:59.200 --> 29:02.166
OUT, THEY FOUND THE PERFECT WAY

29:02.166 --> 29:02.934
TO SAY THANK YOU AND ALSO GET

29:02.934 --> 29:04.633
BACK AT ME.

29:04.633 --> 29:05.767
>> NOW WE HAVE MADE SOME

29:05.767 --> 29:08.233
AMENDMENTS TO IT SINCE YOU SAW

29:08.233 --> 29:13.633
IT LAST HERE ON NEWSWATCH 16

29:13.633 --> 29:15.200
AT 5:00.

29:15.200 --> 29:16.166
JOHN OLIVER'S FACE IS NOW ON IT.

29:16.166 --> 29:16.700
>> John: OH, WELL PLAYED,

29:16.700 --> 29:17.266
SCRANTON!

29:17.266 --> 29:18.033
THERE IS NO MORE PASSIVE

29:18.033 --> 29:18.867
AGGRESSIVE WAY TO THANK SOMEONE

29:18.867 --> 29:19.700
FOR A GIFT THAN BY DRIVING A

29:19.700 --> 29:24.200
TRAIN DIRECTLY INTO THEIR FACE.

29:24.200 --> 29:26.500
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

29:26.500 --> 29:28.600
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.433
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

29:29.433 --> 29:31.934
GOOD NIGHT!
