<i>Do dee chabwon geesa bonkee bolla.</i>

19:35.073 --> 19:37.841
Give up, Jabba.
You're the only ones left.

19:39.077 --> 19:41.979
Submit or suffer.

19:42.047 --> 19:45.316
[chortling]

19:45.384 --> 19:50.955
<i>Weeteebah fa foonta granee, meendeeya.</i>

19:51.023 --> 19:53.457
The mighty Jabba and the Hutt families

19:53.525 --> 19:55.326
have decided to join you.

20:10.008 --> 20:12.410
Between the Hutts, Black Sun,
and the Pykes,

20:12.478 --> 20:15.480
we'll have a large reserve
of muscle and supplies.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.248
Yes.

20:17.316 --> 20:20.385
Then Mandalore and Kenobi
are still our priority?

20:20.452 --> 20:22.387
They are vital.

20:22.455 --> 20:25.557
I'm curious to hear the rest
of your plan.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.859
The vision has expanded.

20:27.927 --> 20:31.830
You will still rule Mandalore,
and under your protection,

20:31.898 --> 20:35.834
I will command
a new galactic underworld.

20:39.906 --> 20:44.043
Mandalore influences a league
of 2,000 neutral systems.

20:44.110 --> 20:47.613
It gives you a great deal
of options for your enterprise.

20:47.681 --> 20:50.983
You have learned
from your previous oversights.

20:51.051 --> 20:52.785
With their combined forces,

20:52.853 --> 20:56.522
the Republic and the Separatists
will be irrelevant.

20:56.590 --> 20:57.990
Then are we ready?

20:58.058 --> 21:00.226
Mobilize the army.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.561
Send an advanced guard to the capital.

21:02.629 --> 21:06.466
I want a list of targets
vital to Mandalore's security.

21:06.533 --> 21:08.567
Choose wisely.

21:08.635 --> 21:11.404
There will be no second chances.

21:22.016 --> 21:23.717
Stay focused.

21:23.785 --> 21:26.821
Mandalore will soon be ours,
and Maul and his brother

21:26.889 --> 21:29.958
will be dead alongside the duchess.
