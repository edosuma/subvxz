WEBVTT

00:02.263 --> 00:03.655
Previously on
Roswell, New Mexico...

00:03.699 --> 00:05.005
JONES:
When I healed Max's body,

00:05.048 --> 00:06.571
we traded places.

00:06.615 --> 00:08.312
If we can swap them
into their rightful bodies

00:08.356 --> 00:09.748
and sever the psychic tether,

00:09.792 --> 00:11.141
we can both save Max

00:11.185 --> 00:12.490
and be free to kill Jones.

00:12.534 --> 00:14.144
You want to know
about the Lockhart Machine.

00:14.188 --> 00:16.016
You want to call someone.

00:16.059 --> 00:18.366
No, you want to call some thing.

00:18.409 --> 00:22.457
Shall we take a vote on who dies
if Liz doesn't mend my genetics?

00:22.500 --> 00:24.285
This compound will keep Max
and Jones apart for good.

00:24.328 --> 00:26.243
Right on schedule.

00:26.287 --> 00:27.940
Give me what I want...

00:27.984 --> 00:30.204
[grunting]...or I drop them.

00:30.247 --> 00:34.686
If only you'd made that choice
the first time around.

00:36.079 --> 00:39.648
[sighs][grunting]

00:43.130 --> 00:45.697
[grunting]

00:47.569 --> 00:48.961
[wind whistling]

00:49.005 --> 00:51.181
[panting]

00:53.140 --> 00:55.098
[grunting]

00:57.709 --> 00:59.755
[grunting]

01:01.235 --> 01:02.540
[Isobel groans]

01:02.584 --> 01:03.759
Liz?

01:03.802 --> 01:05.195
Liz?! [panting]

01:05.239 --> 01:06.762
[panting]

01:06.805 --> 01:08.546
[Isobel groans]

01:08.590 --> 01:09.634
Kyle.

01:09.678 --> 01:11.506
[both grunt]

01:13.116 --> 01:14.204
[grunting]

01:14.248 --> 01:17.555
[high-pitched ringing]

01:17.599 --> 01:19.731
[Michael groans]

01:24.780 --> 01:27.435
[grunting]

01:30.046 --> 01:32.135
[loud panting]

01:32.179 --> 01:33.832
MAX:Oh, God.

01:33.876 --> 01:37.097
Oh. Oh.
[panting]

01:37.140 --> 01:40.187
[groaning]

01:40.230 --> 01:42.014
â™ª

01:42.058 --> 01:43.973
ISOBEL: Okay, well, why don't
we start with the obvious?

01:44.016 --> 01:46.715
Why did Liz give Jones
the only leverage that we had?

01:46.758 --> 01:49.109
We always had
to inject one of the subjects

01:49.152 --> 01:51.111
to separate Max and Jones.

01:51.154 --> 01:52.590
Heath is off running algorithms

01:52.634 --> 01:54.157
right now, and all of
them say that it'll take

01:54.201 --> 01:55.941
nine hours for the proteins
in Jones's cells

01:55.985 --> 01:58.248
to fully detangle themselves
from Max's DNA.

01:58.292 --> 01:59.380
Then we can kill him?

01:59.423 --> 02:00.555
It's not that simple.

02:00.598 --> 02:02.165
Testing shows that the process

02:02.209 --> 02:04.472
of the DNA bonding
will start again.

02:04.515 --> 02:06.604
So then we, what,
stick him again?

02:06.648 --> 02:08.867
No. With Jones's evolved
genetics, it's almost certain

02:08.911 --> 02:10.826
that his body will recognize
the serum as a threat,

02:10.869 --> 02:12.175
and learn to fight it.

02:12.219 --> 02:14.046
So you are saying
that you started a fight

02:14.090 --> 02:15.526
we have to end today.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.789
Otherwise, Max is
super-villain glued to Jones.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.182
I have a plan for that.

02:19.226 --> 02:21.445
Max and Jones will
fully separate.

02:21.489 --> 02:24.448
And at that point, I'm going
to inject Jones with ligands.

02:24.492 --> 02:27.364
Uh, biomolecules that'll attach
to the protein receptors

02:27.408 --> 02:29.627
and will keep the DNA
from reconnecting.

02:29.671 --> 02:30.802
Put it this way.

02:30.846 --> 02:32.326
The cells are water.

02:32.369 --> 02:34.284
The ligands are a wall of oil.

02:34.328 --> 02:37.287
And then we can kill Jones
without killing Max?

02:37.331 --> 02:38.767
Yeah, but first,
we have to find him.

02:38.810 --> 02:39.855
I mean, he was clinging

02:39.898 --> 02:40.986
onto that Lockhart Machine

02:41.030 --> 02:42.162
like it was a life raft.

02:42.205 --> 02:43.598
Clearly, he has a plan for it.

02:43.641 --> 02:45.165
Alex thinks he wants
to make a call with it.

02:45.208 --> 02:47.776
He wants to make a call?
Who-Who's he gonna call? E.T.?

02:47.819 --> 02:49.299
It doesn't matter.

02:49.343 --> 02:51.388
We can use it
to gain an advantage over him.

02:51.432 --> 02:54.652
We know the Lockhart Machine
can send a signal out.

02:54.696 --> 02:55.871
Right?

02:55.914 --> 02:57.394
Well, Eduardo and Alex are
working on a way

02:57.438 --> 02:58.961
to send a signal to it.

02:59.744 --> 03:03.183
Okay, uh, how-how
do they do that?

03:03.226 --> 03:05.054
With another one.

03:05.968 --> 03:08.492
Just like how the Valenti radios
are walkie-talkies of sorts.

03:08.536 --> 03:10.712
That same principle of
broadcasting could be used

03:10.755 --> 03:12.453
through the radio towers
in Roswell.

03:12.496 --> 03:13.758
To find Jones.

03:13.802 --> 03:15.499
Better than that.

03:15.543 --> 03:19.677
The same way that the info
was shoved into Dallas's head

03:19.721 --> 03:21.026
with a burst of frequency.

03:21.070 --> 03:23.507
We can essentially
shove Max and Jones

03:23.551 --> 03:25.248
back into their old bodies.

03:25.292 --> 03:26.945
And-And Liz's salad
dressing shot--

03:26.989 --> 03:28.425
that's our only chance
to kill one clone

03:28.469 --> 03:30.035
without killing the other.

03:30.079 --> 03:32.864
Okay, so, while you guys live in
the land of fingers-crossed,

03:32.908 --> 03:34.562
I'm gonna go rebuild
the only thing

03:34.605 --> 03:36.477
that we actually know
has ever defeated Jones--

03:36.520 --> 03:38.740
my mother's sword.

03:42.961 --> 03:45.137
That's good she came back
from comatose, but, um...

03:45.181 --> 03:46.530
[door opens]

03:46.574 --> 03:48.358
...90 minutes is
really, really troubling.

03:48.402 --> 03:49.881
[door closes]

03:49.925 --> 03:51.709
Thank you, Doctor.

03:51.753 --> 03:55.060
[cries, sniffles]
Hey, Maria.

03:55.104 --> 03:56.453
Hey.

03:56.497 --> 03:57.715
Are you okay?

03:57.759 --> 03:59.978
Yeah, it's just an angry vendor.

04:00.022 --> 04:01.589
What's in the bag?

04:01.632 --> 04:05.506
Well, apparently, Liz's science
gave us a ticking clock

04:05.549 --> 04:09.205
which now means that we have
to defeat Jones today.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.034
Which means we have to somehow

04:12.077 --> 04:13.992
Humpty-Dumpty this thing
back together again.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.473
I think that the question
of fighting Jones

04:16.517 --> 04:19.084
has already been asked
and answered in the form

04:19.128 --> 04:21.043
of two dozen broken pieces.

04:21.086 --> 04:22.349
Are you saying that I'm weak?

04:22.392 --> 04:23.828
What I'm saying is
that maybe your strength

04:23.872 --> 04:25.569
has absolutely nothing
to do with this weapon.

04:25.613 --> 04:28.616
No, no. Liz and Michael
have all these ideas

04:28.659 --> 04:31.053
about how to stop him,
but everything except this sword

04:31.096 --> 04:34.143
is theoretical,
so, we just have to...

04:34.186 --> 04:36.928
Are you bleeding from your nose?

04:36.972 --> 04:38.452
What?

04:38.495 --> 04:40.062
Isobel, when was the last time
you slept?

04:40.105 --> 04:42.586
I don't know, Maria. It's
probably been, like, two days.

04:42.630 --> 04:44.414
But once the sword is intact,

04:44.458 --> 04:45.502
it holds energy,

04:45.546 --> 04:46.590
so I'll be able to draw off that

04:46.634 --> 04:47.765
and just keep going.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.332
As a descendant of Louise's,

04:49.376 --> 04:51.029
I can help Rosa
rebuild the sword.

04:51.073 --> 04:52.248
You need to rest.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.511
So, we'll work up some ideas.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.339
You go take a nap.

04:56.383 --> 04:59.342
Now. Right now.

05:02.998 --> 05:06.088
KYLE:
I thought you and Heath
were testing ligand compounds.

05:06.131 --> 05:10.658
Uh, I gave Heath a break while
the computer analyzes our data.

05:10.701 --> 05:14.314
And so, the head
in the hand is exhaustion?

05:14.357 --> 05:16.316
[sighs]

05:16.359 --> 05:19.319
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose Max

05:19.362 --> 05:21.625
just as I finally
found him again.

05:22.931 --> 05:26.456
You have every right to be
freaked out about saving Max.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.937
I do, but not to
retreat to the lab

05:28.980 --> 05:30.330
when I should've
spoken to him

05:30.373 --> 05:31.592
about everything
that's unfolding.

05:33.376 --> 05:34.769
Kyle,
our track record is garbage

05:34.812 --> 05:36.205
when we're not on the same page.

05:36.248 --> 05:37.815
[beeping]

05:40.035 --> 05:41.863
Are we in this game or not?

05:41.906 --> 05:44.126
The solution I built
to block Max and Jones's

05:44.169 --> 05:46.302
DNA from coming back
together-- it's working.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.523
But the ligand molecules-- they
aren't generating fast enough

05:49.566 --> 05:51.394
to prevent Jones
from retethering.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.048
Once we get this compound
into Jones,

05:53.091 --> 05:55.355
we're gonna have seconds,
not hours, to kill him,

05:55.398 --> 05:57.052
without killing Max.

05:57.095 --> 05:59.359
So we need to find a faster way
to release this in Jones's body?

05:59.402 --> 06:00.708
Yeah.

06:07.932 --> 06:09.847
[sighs]

06:13.068 --> 06:15.853
I need to ask you
about what happens

06:15.897 --> 06:17.855
when the serum
and the science fail.

06:17.899 --> 06:20.641
I am here
to beg you

06:20.684 --> 06:22.599
to do what I may not be
strong enough to do.

06:25.297 --> 06:28.039
Kill me to stop Jones.

06:28.953 --> 06:32.000
We agreed Kamikaze Max
isn't on the table.

06:32.043 --> 06:34.524
No, Liz and Isobel
didn't want to hear it.

06:34.568 --> 06:35.612
We have a plan to kill him.

06:35.656 --> 06:37.614
And he's had a plan since 1947

06:37.658 --> 06:39.442
to fix his genetics
and get off this rock.

06:39.486 --> 06:40.835
We can't let him

06:40.878 --> 06:42.837
go start cloning himself again.

06:42.880 --> 06:46.406
And I am just afraid that
when-when things turn bad,

06:46.449 --> 06:48.886
I'm gonna look at Liz,

06:48.930 --> 06:51.149
and I'm not gonna be ready
to walk away.

06:51.193 --> 06:52.716
Grow up, Max!

06:52.760 --> 06:54.631
Look, I'm trying
to be pragmatic, man.

06:54.675 --> 06:56.981
No, you're not.
You're trying to run.

06:58.940 --> 07:01.986
So what are you so afraid
to say out loud to Liz? Hmm?

07:02.030 --> 07:03.597
Because you're
beating yourself

07:03.640 --> 07:05.425
before Jones even
has the chance.

07:06.251 --> 07:09.124
You tell Alex all your fears?

07:10.952 --> 07:12.606
You know, are you walking
into this battle

07:12.649 --> 07:14.434
with your eyes wide open?

07:14.477 --> 07:15.913
No, I'm not.
I came here

07:15.957 --> 07:17.828
to mine turquoise
I already have enough of.

07:21.528 --> 07:24.574
Maybe today is your last day,
Max.

07:25.706 --> 07:27.621
Maybe it's mine, too.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.405
But if that's true,

07:29.449 --> 07:31.929
we can't walk away
from the tough conversations

07:31.973 --> 07:33.931
with the people who love us.

07:36.325 --> 07:38.806
[rhythmic beeping]

07:41.852 --> 07:42.940
How is he?

07:42.984 --> 07:46.291
Considering
his whole belief system

07:46.335 --> 07:48.032
was put in a blender and, uh,

07:48.076 --> 07:51.296
he nearly died from a
shattered, glowing sword,

07:51.340 --> 07:53.168
I'd say surprisingly good.

07:53.211 --> 07:55.649
And you? How are you doing?

07:55.692 --> 07:57.172
Because you went
right back to work

07:57.215 --> 07:59.348
after being mentally dangled
hundreds of feet in the air.

07:59.391 --> 08:03.526
Yeah, well, like you,
I tend to find comfort

08:03.570 --> 08:05.223
in the science
when things get too loud.

08:05.267 --> 08:07.748
But I do have to tell you,

08:07.791 --> 08:09.967
while I was hanging there,

08:10.011 --> 08:13.057
there was really only one thing
I could think about.

08:14.537 --> 08:16.844
I never got a chance
to say I'm sorry

08:16.887 --> 08:21.326
for what I was a part
of at Max's house,

08:21.370 --> 08:22.806
for Maria's coma, or

08:22.850 --> 08:26.027
trusting Jones
and somehow making things worse.

08:26.070 --> 08:29.944
Man, this is better
than watching

08:29.987 --> 08:31.293
a soap opera.

08:31.336 --> 08:33.121
Oh. There he is.

08:33.164 --> 08:34.514
What can I get
you? Some, uh,

08:34.557 --> 08:37.386
water, ice cream, Bible?

08:37.429 --> 08:39.214
Music.

08:39.257 --> 08:42.173
You know, something that can
get the blood flowing.

08:42.217 --> 08:44.219
You know?

08:46.047 --> 08:48.005
Whoa.

08:48.049 --> 08:52.488
Oh, please tell me you've got
that breakthrough look.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.839
[intro to Shania Twain's "Man!
I Feel Like a Woman!" plays]

08:55.883 --> 08:58.363
â™ª I'm going out tonight

08:58.407 --> 08:59.843
â™ª I'm feelin' all right

08:59.887 --> 09:03.543
â™ª Gonna let it all hang out

09:03.586 --> 09:04.935
â™ª Wanna make some noise

09:04.979 --> 09:07.155
Oh.â™ª Really...

09:07.198 --> 09:08.504
Ah. Ha-ha. Hey.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.288
Wow. That was, uh,

09:10.332 --> 09:12.900
quite the advanced
medical technique.Yeah.

09:12.943 --> 09:15.380
Uh, Liz has got, uh,
Morissette and Malbec,

09:15.424 --> 09:19.080
and my mom has Shania and Soda
when she's stuck on a case.

09:19.123 --> 09:21.256
More importantly,
I thought of something

09:21.299 --> 09:22.605
that could help rapidly
surge your ligands

09:22.649 --> 09:23.737
through Jones's system.

09:23.780 --> 09:25.477
What? Line dancing?Adrenaline.

09:25.521 --> 09:28.872
Exactly. It cycles through the
entire body in seven seconds.

09:28.916 --> 09:31.092
That'll ensure that your
genetic wall will quickly

09:31.135 --> 09:34.965
go up between Jones and Max,
and then you can kill him.

09:43.278 --> 09:46.368
Hmm. You do naps
a lot different than I do.

09:46.411 --> 09:48.849
I really need to remember
to turn off "Find My Friends."

09:48.892 --> 09:51.199
You really need to remember
to trust your friends.

09:51.242 --> 09:52.679
I can't right now, Rosa.

09:52.722 --> 09:55.943
My mother-- she was pregnant,
and she took a stand.

09:55.986 --> 09:57.684
She wasn't some damsel
in distress.

09:57.727 --> 10:00.034
She was a...A bad-ass alien warrior. I know.

10:00.077 --> 10:02.514
I don't need this
from you right now.

10:02.558 --> 10:03.820
The hard truth?

10:03.864 --> 10:06.475
Look, just like any addict,

10:06.518 --> 10:07.998
it doesn't matter
how many times

10:08.042 --> 10:09.739
that love ones tell them
that there's a problem.

10:09.783 --> 10:11.872
You have to admit it...

10:11.915 --> 10:14.831
Fine. You want the hard truth?

10:14.875 --> 10:17.355
Everything in my life
is falling apart right now,

10:17.399 --> 10:19.227
and I can't control it.

10:20.010 --> 10:22.622
I would love to hold your hand
through this, Isobel,

10:22.665 --> 10:24.362
but I can't do it for you.

10:24.406 --> 10:25.755
Nobody can.

10:25.799 --> 10:27.278
You want
to honor the mindfulness

10:27.322 --> 10:28.889
that Anatsa taught you
with archery?

10:28.932 --> 10:30.978
I suggest that you take the need
to be your mom

10:31.021 --> 10:32.632
and shoot it away from you.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.808
Think about your life,
Isobel, actually.

10:34.851 --> 10:37.245
Who you want to be
away from all this noise.

10:38.812 --> 10:41.031
Fire at that.

10:42.206 --> 10:44.644
Don't stop
until you hit the bull's-eye.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.951
[scoffs]

10:53.827 --> 10:57.918
[high-pitched ringing]

10:57.961 --> 10:59.310
[gunshot, glass breaks]

11:01.356 --> 11:02.705
How'd you find me?

11:02.749 --> 11:04.751
You tell me how you plan
to leave the planet,

11:04.794 --> 11:06.535
I'll tell you
how I caught up to you.

11:06.578 --> 11:08.929
You can't shoot me.

11:08.972 --> 11:11.845
This is the body they hope
to put Max back into.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.847
But I'm not here to destroy you.

11:13.890 --> 11:15.675
I'm here to destroy that.

11:15.718 --> 11:18.765
You know I can bend bullets.

11:20.941 --> 11:24.727
Can you do it
five times in a row?

11:27.774 --> 11:29.819
Would you like the
bad news first,

11:29.863 --> 11:32.169
or the bad news first?

11:33.083 --> 11:35.520
Liz's tapes told us that

11:35.564 --> 11:38.698
you have a pear-shaped organ
right under your ribs

11:38.741 --> 11:41.657
that produces alien adrenaline.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.267
[whooshing]

11:43.311 --> 11:45.052
Oh, yeah.

11:45.835 --> 11:47.837
Now I can't sedate you

11:47.881 --> 11:50.710
for risk of changing
any chemical composition

11:50.753 --> 11:53.190
in your body and
altering what we need.

11:53.234 --> 11:56.890
Oh, great. And the good news?

11:57.804 --> 11:59.762
Well, just that, uh,

11:59.806 --> 12:02.634
this is probably
going to hurt like hell.

12:02.678 --> 12:04.027
[exhales]

12:07.509 --> 12:10.338
[electrical hissing]

12:10.381 --> 12:14.646
Okay, you need
to calm down, Max.

12:15.909 --> 12:18.520
This is the only ultrasound
monitor we have. You fry this,

12:18.563 --> 12:20.827
and our chances of killing Jones
fritzes out, too.

12:20.870 --> 12:23.264
Please.Okay. Yeah.

12:24.091 --> 12:25.570
Oh.I'll do it.

12:25.614 --> 12:27.137
Oh, thank God.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.667
[door closes]

12:35.711 --> 12:37.757
I, um... [clears throat]

12:37.800 --> 12:40.760
I wanted
to tell you this morning, but

12:40.803 --> 12:43.153
I am scared of hurting you.

12:43.197 --> 12:45.590
Of dragging you further
into my mess.

12:45.634 --> 12:48.593
I mean, you deserve greatness,
you deserve happiness.

12:48.637 --> 12:49.899
I don't understand why

12:49.943 --> 12:51.466
we keep ending up
at these damn crossroads.

12:51.509 --> 12:53.076
[electrical hissing]

12:53.120 --> 12:54.730
â™ª When all the cares
and the worries you have... â™ª

12:54.774 --> 12:57.037
Hey.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.039
You remember
when we listened to that song

12:59.082 --> 13:00.780
on my Walkman in the playground

13:00.823 --> 13:02.694
when we were kids?You said

13:02.738 --> 13:06.960
that was the first time you ever
felt connected to this world.

13:07.003 --> 13:10.833
And I never told you,
but I feel so lucky

13:10.877 --> 13:13.009
I got to give you that.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.926
You remember the song?

13:16.970 --> 13:18.493
I can never.

13:18.536 --> 13:21.452
Oh. I know... I know
it's in my head somewhere.

13:21.496 --> 13:24.238
I just can't... I can never
think of the name of it.

13:24.281 --> 13:27.284
Uh, it pops in when I'm, like,
in the shower or on a run,

13:27.328 --> 13:29.809
then pops right back out. I...

13:31.941 --> 13:35.771
All I really remember
is your eyes.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.468
â™ª Ooh-ooh...

13:37.512 --> 13:39.601
They made me feel calm.

13:39.644 --> 13:41.646
â™ª Ooh-ooh, ooh...

13:41.690 --> 13:45.259
Keep looking in 'em.

13:45.302 --> 13:48.828
I mean, we could both use
a little bit of calm right now.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.962
â™ª Don't have to be anything [beep]

13:53.006 --> 13:55.922
â™ª To be worthy of your love...

13:55.965 --> 13:58.881
I didn't realize it
at the playground, but

13:58.925 --> 14:01.666
you quiet all the noise,

14:01.710 --> 14:05.453
all the science that's always
rattling around in my head.

14:05.496 --> 14:09.674
And no matter how noisy
today is gonna get,

14:09.718 --> 14:13.722
I have to lean
on what you always do for me.

14:13.765 --> 14:16.812
You let it
all slip away

14:16.856 --> 14:21.773
and let you and me just be
the only people in Roswell.

14:21.817 --> 14:25.995
â™ª It's gonna be all okay...

14:26.039 --> 14:30.652
I used to think it
had to be a choice--

14:30.695 --> 14:32.828
you or the science.

14:32.872 --> 14:37.354
And then, I finally figured out
it's you andthe science.

14:37.398 --> 14:39.922
And if we do it
together, Max Evans,

14:39.966 --> 14:45.275
then I think everything
you fear most in this world--

14:45.319 --> 14:48.278
it could be the thing
that saves it.

14:48.322 --> 14:51.151
â™ª If you need to laugh,
if you need a second chance â™ª

14:51.194 --> 14:53.893
â™ª We all do

14:53.936 --> 14:57.200
â™ª I will be there for you

14:57.244 --> 15:01.552
â™ª I will be there
for you â™ª

15:01.596 --> 15:05.730
â™ª I'll be there â™ª Oh, ohâ™ª

15:05.774 --> 15:08.733
â™ª Oh-oh, oh-oh â™ª Oh, ohâ™ª

15:08.777 --> 15:10.561
â™ª I'll be there...

15:10.605 --> 15:12.085
[gasps]

15:13.651 --> 15:14.870
[gasps softly]

15:14.914 --> 15:17.786
â™ª I'll be there...

15:17.829 --> 15:19.440
[gasping]

15:19.483 --> 15:22.138
â™ª Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh â™ª Oh, ohâ™ª

15:22.182 --> 15:25.054
[gasps]â™ª I'll be there...

15:25.098 --> 15:26.490
[inhales sharply]

15:26.534 --> 15:28.666
Hey.

15:28.710 --> 15:30.190
[shallow breathing]

15:30.233 --> 15:34.759
â™ª I'll be there for you â™ª Oh, ohâ™ª

15:34.803 --> 15:36.892
â™ª I'll be there for you

15:36.936 --> 15:40.374
â™ª I will be there for you

15:40.417 --> 15:42.942
â™ª I will be there for you.

15:48.295 --> 15:49.905
MARIA: I think
we're making some progress.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.994
Mm. I really thought alien stuff
would be more exciting.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.604
ISOBEL:
Okay, so, uh,

15:53.648 --> 15:58.044
I got lost this
year on my, uh,

15:58.087 --> 15:59.610
quest to be a
"woman as warrior."

15:59.654 --> 16:01.786
And I told myself
that in order to be strong,

16:01.830 --> 16:05.225
I had to do everything on
my own terms, lone wolf style.

16:05.268 --> 16:07.531
It's just 'cause
I was afraid.

16:07.575 --> 16:11.883
I don't, uh, have the easiest
time letting people in.

16:11.927 --> 16:14.974
And today, I realized that

16:15.017 --> 16:17.324
it's a cage,

16:17.367 --> 16:20.457
and I'm trapped
behind these walls

16:20.501 --> 16:22.372
that I built to protect myself.

16:22.416 --> 16:25.375
And I don't want
to be a lone wolf.

16:26.376 --> 16:28.770
I want to be...
I want to be part of the pack.

16:31.599 --> 16:33.557
Can we hug you now?

16:38.562 --> 16:40.303
Oh. Thank you.

16:40.347 --> 16:42.523
MARIA:
All right, here's what I got.

16:42.566 --> 16:47.136
This sword was owned
by Theo, Louise and Nora.

16:47.180 --> 16:49.486
I think that's why
it shattered in your hand.

16:49.530 --> 16:51.488
Yes, you were able
to hold it,

16:51.532 --> 16:54.404
but it doesn't necessarily
represent you or your power.

16:54.448 --> 16:57.320
But remember,
Jones told you

16:57.364 --> 17:00.671
there were two ways
that aliens could draw strength.

17:00.715 --> 17:04.110
Through their triad,
essentially their chosen family,

17:04.153 --> 17:05.981
and through
their generation line,

17:06.025 --> 17:07.591
meaning their literal family.

17:07.635 --> 17:10.638
That's what we have here--
you, me

17:10.681 --> 17:12.553
and the alien
we descended from.

17:14.685 --> 17:16.774
Okay, I get
that Michael made that bracelet

17:16.818 --> 17:19.560
from the flower that blossomed
from my mother's grave,

17:19.603 --> 17:21.779
but doesn't that inhibit
our power?

17:21.823 --> 17:25.218
Yes, the yellow pollen does,
but Jones told Liz

17:25.261 --> 17:29.091
that these purple petals here--

17:29.135 --> 17:31.746
these are like
alien building blocks.

17:31.789 --> 17:35.358
Maria, I'm not comfortable
with destroying that bracelet.

17:35.402 --> 17:37.099
It's the one thing
that's keeping your brain

17:37.143 --> 17:38.796
from turning into oatmeal.

17:41.408 --> 17:45.238
I got a call today that my mom's
condition is worsening.

17:46.848 --> 17:48.545
You're my family,

17:48.589 --> 17:51.505
not some funny lineage
that we joke about.

17:51.548 --> 17:53.768
You care about me like a sister.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.424
And I care about you
like one, too.

17:57.467 --> 18:00.688
So I'm going
to help you bring down Jones.

18:00.731 --> 18:02.907
And then, with the science
that Liz gets

18:02.951 --> 18:06.694
from studying
his dead intergalactic ass...

18:08.261 --> 18:11.133
[voice breaking]:
...you're gonna help me
not become my mom.

18:12.787 --> 18:16.573
You mend me today,
I mend you tomorrow.

18:16.617 --> 18:19.663
That's the definition of family.

18:25.669 --> 18:27.410
Where we at?

18:27.454 --> 18:29.020
Well, the specs of this radio
now match that

18:29.064 --> 18:30.413
of the Lockhart Machine.

18:30.457 --> 18:32.328
I just have to, uh,
make some alien glass

18:32.372 --> 18:34.417
out of all the turquoise
you said you had to mine,

18:34.461 --> 18:38.029
but I found a bunch
in a drawer here, so...

18:38.073 --> 18:40.554
I'm not gonna lie to you.

18:42.077 --> 18:43.600
I'm sort of freaked out.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.820
Are you afraid
this isn't gonna work?

18:45.863 --> 18:48.649
I'm afraid we're only getting
the start of something.

18:53.001 --> 18:56.309
You know, we never even went
on a real first date.

18:58.833 --> 19:01.488
We never walked down
Main Street holding hands.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.102
I need you to know,

19:07.146 --> 19:09.322
if this goes bad tomorrow...

19:10.801 --> 19:12.151
...I lo...

19:12.194 --> 19:14.109
No. Don't say those words.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.416
We are going to
win this, okay?

19:16.459 --> 19:19.375
Winning is what worries me.

19:19.419 --> 19:21.334
What? Can-Can you explain that?

19:24.250 --> 19:26.252
What if I have
to kill my own father?

19:26.295 --> 19:29.168
You gonna love me then?

19:34.347 --> 19:36.566
Am I still gonna love myself?

19:38.351 --> 19:40.831
That self-loathing
is what caused this mess

19:40.875 --> 19:42.355
between us for 15 years.

19:42.398 --> 19:44.487
What's winning gonna do?

19:44.531 --> 19:46.185
Is it gonna set us right back
to square one?

19:46.228 --> 19:49.013
Are we gonna be able to survive
that war again if it does?

19:49.057 --> 19:50.711
No. Listen to me.

19:50.754 --> 19:55.194
We are not who we were in high
school, let alone a year ago.

19:56.717 --> 19:58.849
We already defeated
one monstrous father,

19:58.893 --> 20:00.199
and we will do it again.

20:07.249 --> 20:09.469
[phone buzzes, chimes]

20:11.297 --> 20:14.909
Liz's serum to permanently
sever Max from Jones is ready.

20:14.952 --> 20:17.651
I'll finish the wiring
at the meet spot.

20:19.087 --> 20:20.871
You go to Deep Sky

20:20.915 --> 20:23.047
and get us controls
of some radio towers, huh?

20:23.091 --> 20:25.311
Okay.

20:41.022 --> 20:43.242
[high-pitched ringing]

20:45.200 --> 20:47.420
[electrical hissing]

20:59.258 --> 21:01.216
Oh, my God.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.350
Huh. I can't believe it worked.

21:05.568 --> 21:08.615
[laughing]:
Oh, my gosh.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.537
So you're sure this is gonna
swap me and Jones?

21:17.580 --> 21:20.279
Uh... 92% sure.

21:20.322 --> 21:22.106
Uh, what about the other
eight percent?

21:22.150 --> 21:23.586
Blind faith.

21:23.630 --> 21:27.155
But I am technically a genius.

21:28.156 --> 21:31.333
Hey. So how are we
on the timetable to kill Jones?

21:31.377 --> 21:33.030
Uh, we can inject him
with ligands

21:33.074 --> 21:35.598
that'll keep you two apart
in 22 minutes and nine seconds.

21:35.642 --> 21:39.298
Okay. Maybe a kiss for luck?

21:42.736 --> 21:46.914
I will kiss you when you're back
in your own body, Max Evans.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.746
[exhales] Okay.

21:58.447 --> 22:00.449
[high-pitched electrical
squealing and hissing]

22:00.493 --> 22:03.800
[clacking]

22:03.844 --> 22:05.411
[groans]

22:18.075 --> 22:20.643
Of course
you are behind this, Elizabeth.

22:28.129 --> 22:29.870
Impressive.

22:29.913 --> 22:32.394
You've managed
to swap our bodies

22:32.438 --> 22:34.004
and mute my abilities
all at once.

22:34.048 --> 22:35.832
And since you don't have
your pointy glow stick,

22:35.876 --> 22:38.400
we've turned you
into just your normal,

22:38.444 --> 22:40.402
pain-in-the-ass galactic bully.

22:40.446 --> 22:42.752
I'm not caught.

22:42.796 --> 22:44.406
I think
I'll just have a better view

22:44.450 --> 22:46.365
while I wait
for my plan to unfold.

22:46.408 --> 22:47.496
What are you talking about?

22:47.540 --> 22:49.193
I saw your plan to kill me

22:49.237 --> 22:50.760
in Eduardo's head.

22:53.763 --> 22:56.375
What could possibly be
so amusing?

22:56.418 --> 22:58.420
No. I'm just thinking about Max

22:58.464 --> 23:00.553
when he realizes
where he ended up.

23:00.596 --> 23:03.947
[groaning, gasping]

23:03.991 --> 23:05.296
Okay.Oh.

23:05.340 --> 23:07.168
Hey, no, no, no.
No, stay with me. Stay with me.

23:07.211 --> 23:08.169
Stay with me.

23:08.212 --> 23:10.519
[groans]

23:10.563 --> 23:12.521
[groaning]

23:12.565 --> 23:14.218
[groans][glass breaks]

23:14.262 --> 23:16.395
[gasping]Okay.

23:16.438 --> 23:17.874
You're okay. You're okay.
You're okay.

23:17.918 --> 23:18.788
I-I'm good?

23:18.832 --> 23:20.399
Okay, Max is on his way to Alex

23:20.442 --> 23:21.748
with the Lockhart Machine.

23:21.791 --> 23:23.924
He was able to save Eduardo
in the nick of time.

23:23.967 --> 23:25.926
Can't keep a good Valenti down.

23:33.934 --> 23:37.328
[laughs]
This is what you call a cavalry?

23:37.372 --> 23:39.635
What a sad lot.

23:39.679 --> 23:41.245
I have an opportunity.

23:41.289 --> 23:42.595
Who wants to make a deal?

23:42.638 --> 23:44.553
When I get out
of these restraints--

23:44.597 --> 23:46.250
and I will get out--

23:46.294 --> 23:48.775
whoever helps me survives.

23:52.082 --> 23:55.259
You keep trying to divide us,
but we stand together.

23:55.303 --> 23:56.957
Then you'll fall together.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.743
You'll fail while you assemble
this shoddy device.

24:00.787 --> 24:02.745
I mean, this radio is
as poorly constructed

24:02.789 --> 24:04.617
as the Lockhart Machine.

24:06.706 --> 24:09.099
You're wondering
if I turned it on.

24:09.143 --> 24:12.799
Then undo my restraints
and jump into my head, son.

24:12.842 --> 24:15.323
You'll see that
I called a vessel

24:15.366 --> 24:18.369
and those ready to navigate
once they reawaken.

24:18.413 --> 24:19.936
I think you're bluffing.

24:19.980 --> 24:22.722
Maybe once I'm gone,
you'll figure out how I escaped.

24:22.765 --> 24:24.419
Maybe you talk too much.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.855
JONES:
While we wait,

24:25.899 --> 24:29.163
have you figured out the mistake
my son made yet, Rosa?

24:29.206 --> 24:31.121
No?

24:31.165 --> 24:35.604
Okay. Then I'll conserve
my energy until the fun begins.

24:37.301 --> 24:39.608
So why are we drawing my blood?

24:39.652 --> 24:41.784
I thought...
I thought we had a time frame

24:41.828 --> 24:44.134
for, uh, when my DNA
is decoupled from Jones.

24:44.178 --> 24:46.963
Given we've got only
one shot at this,

24:47.007 --> 24:49.879
we need everything
to be exact.

24:51.098 --> 24:53.361
Which is why I'm
sure, genetically,

24:53.404 --> 24:55.189
our clock is on track.

24:57.191 --> 24:59.236
[whirring]

25:02.283 --> 25:04.067
You have any idea

25:04.111 --> 25:06.417
what our unwanted party guest
was referring to?

25:06.461 --> 25:10.552
This is my fifth rodeo,
but still don't know everything.

25:10.596 --> 25:12.336
Oh.

25:12.380 --> 25:13.642
Aah.

25:13.686 --> 25:14.991
ISOBEL:
Whoa, Rosa.

25:15.035 --> 25:17.167
Are you okay?
What do you hear?

25:17.211 --> 25:21.563
Uh, it sounds...

25:21.607 --> 25:25.045
loud and s... squeaky.

25:25.088 --> 25:27.264
Squeaky? Like bats?

25:27.308 --> 25:29.571
The Valenti radio uses infrared,

25:29.615 --> 25:33.183
which can mess
with the bats' echolocation.

25:33.227 --> 25:35.664
[bats squeaking]

25:35.708 --> 25:37.144
[gasping]

25:42.497 --> 25:44.151
[electrical pop]

25:46.370 --> 25:48.242
[high-pitched ringing]

25:48.285 --> 25:50.200
[groaning]

25:50.244 --> 25:52.420
Show me where the serum is.[groaning]

25:52.463 --> 25:54.074
[gasping]

25:56.467 --> 25:57.686
[grunts]

25:57.730 --> 25:58.992
[grunts][groans]

26:04.084 --> 26:06.782
Oh, Isobel, it's me.What? What?

26:06.826 --> 26:08.088
Iz, it's me. It's me. It's me.What?

26:08.131 --> 26:10.394
I was with Kyle.
Please, we got to...

26:10.438 --> 26:11.744
we got to swap me back.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.660
I'm gonna need that device.

26:16.226 --> 26:17.706
[grunts]

26:17.750 --> 26:19.578
I really don't want
to fight you,

26:19.621 --> 26:21.623
but I definitely can't give you
that alien box.

26:21.667 --> 26:24.583
[high-pitched ringing]

26:24.626 --> 26:25.845
I guess I'll kill you then.

26:25.888 --> 26:28.108
[clack, rhythmic clicking,
groaning]

26:31.938 --> 26:34.288
[groans]
Oh.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.247
Oh, today is not my day.

26:37.291 --> 26:39.249
Evans?
Aah.

26:39.293 --> 26:40.337
Is that really you?

26:40.381 --> 26:42.296
Yes! Damn it, Kyle, it's me!

26:48.345 --> 26:50.391
[groaning] [high-pitched ringing]

26:56.179 --> 26:58.704
[groans]

27:04.797 --> 27:10.367
[high-pitched ringing]

27:12.935 --> 27:16.199
You will never be
as powerful as your old man.

27:20.334 --> 27:22.249
[groans]

27:22.292 --> 27:23.424
[panting]

27:24.904 --> 27:28.211
Yeah, but he's got a pretty
clever circle of friends.

27:28.255 --> 27:29.343
[car approaching]

27:54.194 --> 27:55.674
Listen, Guerin,
we have 47 seconds

27:55.717 --> 27:56.805
until Jones can use this serum.

27:56.849 --> 27:58.328
And the woman I love
has the thing

27:58.372 --> 27:59.503
we need to end it.

27:59.547 --> 28:02.158
It's time
you hold my metaphorical beer.

28:02.202 --> 28:05.118
Well, Elizabeth, I told you I'd
get you to untangle me from Max.

28:05.161 --> 28:08.164
You will be.
On my terms.

28:08.208 --> 28:09.513
And then we're gonna kill you.

28:09.557 --> 28:13.692
[grunting]

28:13.735 --> 28:14.954
ISOBEL:
I wish Dallas were here.

28:14.997 --> 28:16.433
Theoretically,
he can control water.

28:16.477 --> 28:19.001
I have a fire
extinguisher in the car.

28:19.045 --> 28:21.395
What?!I'm a registered EMT.

28:21.438 --> 28:22.701
Valenti, go get it!

28:22.744 --> 28:24.790
[grunting]

28:26.661 --> 28:28.097
[grunts]

28:29.882 --> 28:32.711
[high-pitched ringing]

28:33.755 --> 28:35.365
[grunting]

28:38.629 --> 28:40.283
Isobel!

28:41.720 --> 28:44.070
[grunting]

28:51.860 --> 28:53.993
Your body will still be mine.

28:54.036 --> 28:56.082
Michael, are you okay?

28:56.125 --> 28:59.346
No way in hell
you win today.

29:01.696 --> 29:04.830
[electrical hissing]

29:04.873 --> 29:06.396
[gasps]

29:06.440 --> 29:07.876
[grunts]

29:07.920 --> 29:09.748
[electrical hissing]

29:14.013 --> 29:16.102
[electrical hum][gasps]

29:16.145 --> 29:17.756
[sighs]

29:17.799 --> 29:19.235
[panting]

29:21.803 --> 29:24.414
ISOBEL: How do we tell
which one is Max?
I'm Max.

29:24.458 --> 29:26.329
Of course you'd say that.I can prove it.

29:26.373 --> 29:27.766
The secret ingredient
to Space jam.

29:27.809 --> 29:29.202
It's kumquat rinds.

29:30.377 --> 29:33.119
Liz, it's me.
Look in my eyes.

29:38.689 --> 29:41.475
There's too much fear
coming off all of us.

29:41.518 --> 29:42.781
I can't get a read
on their auras.

29:42.824 --> 29:43.782
What about you, Rosa?

29:43.825 --> 29:45.087
Can you get a frequency?

29:45.131 --> 29:46.436
Uh, they're standing
too close together

29:46.480 --> 29:47.873
for me to make it out.

29:50.658 --> 29:53.835
Maria? You got Big Bob on you?

29:53.879 --> 29:55.141
Yup.

29:55.968 --> 29:57.665
I'll get it.

29:57.708 --> 29:59.362
That-that's a bad idea, Liz.

29:59.406 --> 30:00.973
No, it's a good one.

30:01.887 --> 30:03.976
I trust you, Liz.

30:15.074 --> 30:16.727
What was
our first lab experiment

30:16.771 --> 30:19.208
in high school biology class?

30:19.252 --> 30:21.820
Uh, dissecting a salamander?

30:21.863 --> 30:22.995
You nicknamed him "Sammy."

30:23.038 --> 30:23.996
Yeah, you laughed at me 'cause

30:24.039 --> 30:25.345
I couldn't make the first cut.

30:29.610 --> 30:31.438
[sighs]

30:36.747 --> 30:39.141
When's the first time
you were in my bedroom?

30:39.185 --> 30:41.274
I've never been there.

30:41.317 --> 30:43.102
I was... I was gonna go once,
but I got nervous,

30:43.145 --> 30:44.364
and I blew up
the milkshake machine.

30:44.407 --> 30:45.887
Oh, I was just afraid
of your dad,

30:45.931 --> 30:47.976
so I made up an excuse,
and I left.

31:03.426 --> 31:05.776
What song was playing
on my Walkman

31:05.820 --> 31:08.562
at the playground
the day we met?

31:14.176 --> 31:16.396
"Sledgehammer."

31:16.439 --> 31:18.137
Peter Gabriel.

31:18.964 --> 31:20.922
That's it.

31:20.966 --> 31:23.011
That's the song.

31:25.971 --> 31:27.537
I knew you'd show yourself.

31:27.581 --> 31:28.930
No, no, no. Liz.

31:28.974 --> 31:30.758
[gunshot, loud gasps]

31:30.801 --> 31:31.802
What?

31:31.846 --> 31:33.239
[gasps]

31:33.282 --> 31:36.111
[coughing]

31:39.288 --> 31:42.944
You said that song
is somewhere in your head,

31:42.988 --> 31:45.468
but all you can remember
are my eyes.

31:45.512 --> 31:47.209
Yeah.

31:49.211 --> 31:50.734
[grunting][shrieks]

31:50.778 --> 31:52.693
ISOBEL:Michael, don't let
him jump back in.

31:54.782 --> 31:56.827
[grunts]

31:56.871 --> 31:58.394
[gasps]

31:58.438 --> 32:00.222
[grunts]

32:00.266 --> 32:02.616
[gasps]

32:08.578 --> 32:11.364
[groans][panting]

32:12.104 --> 32:14.410
[guttural groan]

32:17.936 --> 32:20.590
[sighs][panting]

32:20.634 --> 32:22.723
[panting]

32:25.944 --> 32:29.034
[sighs, sniffles]

32:36.563 --> 32:39.000
[truck approaches,
doors open]

32:39.044 --> 32:41.307
[truck doors close]

32:43.700 --> 32:46.268
Please tell me you know there
is only one "L" in "Michael"

32:46.312 --> 32:47.966
for the hero of your
next secret novel.

32:48.009 --> 32:50.707
All right. Thank you
for letting me know.

32:50.751 --> 32:53.014
I, uh... I got this for you.

32:53.058 --> 32:54.973
No.Brother!

32:55.016 --> 32:57.932
Please tell me we are not
all getting a sappy letter.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.152
Yeah, let's stop
looking backwards.

33:00.195 --> 33:02.676
We, uh... No.

33:02.719 --> 33:05.940
This is my secret
acetone margarita recipe.

33:05.984 --> 33:06.985
Mm.[gasps]

33:07.028 --> 33:10.640
At last! Yes! Mmm.

33:10.684 --> 33:11.990
Thank you.

33:12.816 --> 33:14.427
So maybe

33:14.470 --> 33:16.516
while you mix up
the next pitcher...ISOBEL: Okay.

33:16.559 --> 33:18.474
...we can discuss
what to do with Jones' body?

33:18.518 --> 33:20.999
Mm-hmm.Ah. You want to give it
to Liz, don't you?

33:21.042 --> 33:22.478
Yeah, I do, but I...

33:22.522 --> 33:25.220
I think it's something we should
discuss. No more secrets.

33:25.264 --> 33:27.701
And there's someone
who should also have a vote.

33:28.876 --> 33:31.052
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

33:31.096 --> 33:34.838
Yeah, Heath had
a very long confessional.

33:34.882 --> 33:38.103
How is, uh,
Liz's Work Max doing?

33:38.886 --> 33:40.496
He's all right.

33:40.540 --> 33:43.151
You know, he's got a lot
of soul-searching to do,

33:43.195 --> 33:44.761
but nothing a few mai tais

33:44.805 --> 33:47.025
or a long look on
the mirror can't fix.

33:47.068 --> 33:48.330
Mm.

33:48.374 --> 33:49.984
Well, it's not a mai tai.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.507
Mmm.Okay.

33:51.551 --> 33:52.682
Try this.

33:52.726 --> 33:54.989
Okay. Thank you.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.730
I'm so thirsty.
Thank you.Mmm.

33:56.773 --> 33:58.819
Mmm.ISOBEL:
Mmm.

33:58.862 --> 34:01.256
That's different,
but it's good, though.

34:01.300 --> 34:03.041
It's 'cause
it's got acetone in it.

34:03.084 --> 34:04.564
What?!

34:06.261 --> 34:07.784
We have a lot
to share with you.

34:12.441 --> 34:14.400
Hey.

34:14.443 --> 34:15.314
Hey.

34:15.357 --> 34:17.794
Arturo said you would be here.

34:19.796 --> 34:22.103
Oh. What is this?

34:22.147 --> 34:23.931
You know I don't like surprises.

34:23.974 --> 34:26.238
Mm, Rosa doesn't.

34:26.281 --> 34:28.327
Maybe Rosalinda does.

34:29.197 --> 34:30.677
I asked our new
clandestine uncle

34:30.720 --> 34:31.852
for a favor.

34:31.895 --> 34:33.636
You are officially

34:33.680 --> 34:35.899
Rosalinda Ortecho,
who, I might add,

34:35.943 --> 34:38.728
is actually going on a trip
to New York for a few months.

34:40.252 --> 34:42.950
[sighs]
Oh, my God.

34:42.993 --> 34:46.388
I thought you would be
a little less dour.

34:46.432 --> 34:49.130
No, no, no.
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm...

34:49.174 --> 34:51.480
I'm all fireworks
on the inside. I just,

34:51.524 --> 34:53.569
um... I...

34:53.613 --> 34:55.919
I just got this flash of worry.

34:55.963 --> 34:58.226
You know, like...

34:58.270 --> 35:01.273
like,
what if I ruin this life, too?

35:03.884 --> 35:07.148
I read on a mural
somewhere that...

35:07.192 --> 35:09.803
cracks are where
the light gets in.

35:17.941 --> 35:20.422
â™ª

35:20.466 --> 35:22.163
â™ª I'll be on my way...

35:22.207 --> 35:23.773
Mmm.

35:23.817 --> 35:26.124
This is for you.

35:26.167 --> 35:28.604
And this is for me.[laughs]

35:29.692 --> 35:31.781
Mmm. Ooh.

35:31.825 --> 35:33.783
[sighs]

35:33.827 --> 35:35.263
Okay, so where's Alex?

35:35.307 --> 35:38.919
He is finishing up some analysis
on the Lockhart Machine.

35:38.962 --> 35:42.749
So, um, did E.T. phone home?

35:42.792 --> 35:46.927
Alex said that the, uh, glass
inside the machine was fried,

35:46.970 --> 35:49.016
so, it doesn't appear so.

35:49.059 --> 35:50.800
That's good.Yeah.

35:50.844 --> 35:52.715
'Cause the way Jones was
talking, it sounded like

35:52.759 --> 35:55.196
there was a whole lot of stuff
that we didn't know about.

35:56.415 --> 35:58.156
What do you think?

35:59.896 --> 36:01.942
I think...

36:01.985 --> 36:04.640
Alex texted me
to meet him in an hour

36:04.684 --> 36:07.208
for our first actual date.

36:07.252 --> 36:09.863
Oh, my God.

36:09.906 --> 36:11.821
Yeah, so I think
I'm gonna leave the mysteries

36:11.865 --> 36:14.128
of the universe on hold
for the night.

36:14.172 --> 36:17.566
I'm happy for you, bro.

36:17.610 --> 36:23.050
â™ª Yours was just
a loser's game... â™ª

36:23.093 --> 36:24.921
Oh! Hi.

36:24.965 --> 36:26.227
Hey.

36:26.271 --> 36:28.142
What did I do to deserve that?

36:28.186 --> 36:30.492
Uh, there are a lot of reasons.

36:30.536 --> 36:32.668
Mm?Was thinking I could
work through them

36:32.712 --> 36:34.235
alphabetically on
the dance floor.

36:34.279 --> 36:35.889
Ooh, I would love to,

36:35.932 --> 36:38.413
but I've got to make some drinks
for table seven.

36:38.457 --> 36:41.547
Hey, you know what?
You guys go.

36:41.590 --> 36:43.636
I'm a DeLuca.
This is my birthright.

36:43.679 --> 36:47.248
Okay, don't push your luck...
but thank you.

36:47.292 --> 36:49.511
Go dance.

36:50.686 --> 36:56.214
â™ª I won't be soon to forget...

36:57.519 --> 36:59.521
Let's get out of here.

36:59.565 --> 37:01.871
Where do you want to go?

37:01.915 --> 37:04.396
To the ocean.

37:09.052 --> 37:10.489
When you texted me,

37:10.532 --> 37:13.622
"I want to try something
we've never done before,"

37:13.666 --> 37:16.234
I did not think we would end
up in front of Papa Manes.

37:16.277 --> 37:18.279
â™ª Clouds so softly

37:18.323 --> 37:19.889
We beat him.

37:19.933 --> 37:21.761
â™ª Full of rain

37:23.371 --> 37:25.155
â™ª The summer fell...

37:25.199 --> 37:26.766
I know.

37:30.683 --> 37:36.428
â™ª Now it's all a feeling
I can't get back again â™ª

37:40.910 --> 37:45.959
â™ª Throw your arms
around my neck â™ª

37:48.309 --> 37:53.183
â™ª I won't be soon to forget...

37:53.227 --> 37:55.621
We're closed!

37:55.664 --> 37:57.492
â™ª Throw your arms
around my neck... â™ª

37:57.536 --> 37:58.711
I always wanted to say that.

37:58.754 --> 38:00.713
[laughs]I was looking for Maria.

38:00.756 --> 38:02.149
Actually never got a chance

38:02.192 --> 38:03.803
to say thank you
for saving my life.

38:03.846 --> 38:06.762
Yeah, that's a big one. Um,
I gave our girl the night off.

38:06.806 --> 38:10.331
Oh. Well, then, um...
[laughs]

38:10.375 --> 38:11.985
You want me to stay?

38:12.028 --> 38:13.421
I can help you clean up.

38:13.465 --> 38:17.338
Um, actually, it's kind of
cathartic me time.

38:17.382 --> 38:19.297
I mean, you know
what they say.

38:19.340 --> 38:20.950
Mend the bar, mend the mind.

38:20.994 --> 38:22.865
Yeah. Yeah, I understand.

38:22.909 --> 38:26.913
Um, well, I guess
this is good night.

38:26.956 --> 38:31.526
â™ª Cloudy thoughts
against the clear blue sky... â™ª

38:31.570 --> 38:33.615
You know what, Valenti?

38:33.659 --> 38:35.269
â™ª I felt like getting high...

38:35.313 --> 38:37.010
Want a dance?

38:37.924 --> 38:43.364
'Cause, um, I didn't really get
to celebrate at all today.

38:43.408 --> 38:45.540
I want to just
blow off some steam.

38:45.584 --> 38:48.456
Uh, yeah, um...

38:48.500 --> 38:50.676
I mean, there's no pressure.
Just a dance.

38:52.373 --> 38:56.812
â™ª And you know they don't care
if we live or die, so... â™ª

38:56.856 --> 38:58.292
Hey.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.990
Hey. Oh. Oh. Mmm.

39:01.034 --> 39:02.818
Oh.

39:02.862 --> 39:05.081
Mmm.

39:05.125 --> 39:06.822
What was that for?

39:06.866 --> 39:09.434
Just got a job offer to head up
my own column at the Dailen

39:09.477 --> 39:12.001
with reprints in
Albuquerque Journal.

39:12.045 --> 39:13.394
Oh. That's amazing.

39:13.438 --> 39:14.917
[laughs]Mmm.

39:14.961 --> 39:17.746
I'm so proud of you.Thank you.

39:17.790 --> 39:20.401
That's great news. [laughs]
It's great. That's great news.

39:20.445 --> 39:23.404
And that's great tequila. You
guys should... should celebrate.

39:23.448 --> 39:24.840
I'll grab another
for Maria.

39:24.884 --> 39:26.625
Why don't you stay, Valenti?
Have a drink with us.

39:26.668 --> 39:28.278
Celebrate.Yeah.

39:28.322 --> 39:31.934
Uh... perhaps another time.

39:32.935 --> 39:34.154
Oh, my God.

39:35.547 --> 39:38.114
â™ª

39:45.731 --> 39:48.211
What are you doing?

39:48.255 --> 39:50.344
I've never been in here.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.259
â™ª Throw your arms
around my neck â™ª

39:52.302 --> 39:55.567
So I'm just enjoying seeing
another layer of you.

39:55.610 --> 39:57.046
â™ª I won't be soon...

39:57.090 --> 39:59.048
I know I can be
a little slow sometimes,

39:59.092 --> 40:01.529
but this doesn't seem
like the ocean.

40:02.530 --> 40:04.140
â™ª Throw your arms
around my neck... â™ª

40:04.184 --> 40:06.360
Well...

40:06.404 --> 40:08.536
this'll have to do

40:08.580 --> 40:11.191
until we get to
the actual one.

40:11.234 --> 40:13.106
â™ª To forget...

40:13.149 --> 40:15.195
But I am certain, Max Evans,

40:15.238 --> 40:16.762
that we will get there.

40:16.805 --> 40:19.025
â™ª Throw your arms
around my neck â™ª

40:19.068 --> 40:21.288
First, I need you to do
something very important for me.

40:21.331 --> 40:23.464
Anything.

40:23.508 --> 40:26.815
I need you
to lock the door with your mind.

40:27.642 --> 40:31.472
â™ª Throw your arms
around my neck â™ª

40:31.516 --> 40:34.562
â™ª Come on, come on now, child

40:34.606 --> 40:37.217
â™ª I won't be soon

40:37.260 --> 40:40.568
â™ª To forget.

40:42.788 --> 40:46.052
[lively music plays]

40:46.095 --> 40:48.141
[singing in Spanish]

40:55.931 --> 40:58.456
[radio broadcast distorts]

41:14.820 --> 41:17.910
Allie? SeÃ±ora Allie?

41:17.953 --> 41:20.303
I have a woman
here to see you.

41:20.347 --> 41:23.872
I believe she's one of the
sky people that you talk about

41:23.916 --> 41:26.135
when you drink
too much mescal.

41:29.661 --> 41:31.532
What's her name?

41:31.576 --> 41:33.969
She keeps repeating one...

41:34.013 --> 41:35.623
Liz Ortecho?

41:35.667 --> 41:38.974
[laughs]
That's-that's not her name.

41:39.018 --> 41:41.847
Liz Ortecho was a student
of mine.

41:48.375 --> 41:52.379
How the hell do you know
who Liz Ortecho is?
