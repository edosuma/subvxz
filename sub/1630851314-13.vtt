into their rightful bodies

we start with the obvious?

Why did Liz give Jones
the only leverage that we had?

01:46.758 --> 01:49.109
We always had
to inject one of the subjects

01:49.152 --> 01:51.111
to separate Max and Jones.

01:51.154 --> 01:52.590
Heath is off running algorithms

01:52.634 --> 01:54.157
right now, and all of
them say that it'll take

01:54.201 --> 01:55.941
nine hours for the proteins
in Jones's cells

01:55.985 --> 01:58.248
to fully detangle themselves
from Max's DNA.

01:58.292 --> 01:59.380
Then we can kill him?

01:59.423 --> 02:00.555
It's not that simple.

02:00.598 --> 02:02.165
Testing shows that the process

02:02.209 --> 02:04.472
of the DNA bonding
will start again.

02:04.515 --> 02:06.604
So then we, what,
stick him again?

02:06.648 --> 02:08.867
No. With Jones's evolved
genetics, it's almost certain

02:08.911 --> 02:10.826
that his body will recognize
the serum as a threat,

02:10.869 --> 02:12.175
and learn to fight it.

02:12.219 --> 02:14.046
So you are saying
that you started a fight

02:14.090 --> 02:15.526
we have to end today.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.789
Otherwise, Max is
super-villain glued to Jones.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.182
I have a plan for that.

02:19.226 --> 02:21.445
Max and Jones will
fully separate.

02:21.489 --> 02:24.448
And at that point, I'm going
to inject Jones with ligands.

02:24.492 --> 02:27.364
Uh, biomolecules that'll attach
to the protein receptors

02:27.408 --> 02:29.627
and will keep the DNA
from reconnecting.

02:29.671 --> 02:30.802
Put it this way.

02:30.846 --> 02:32.326
The cells are water.

02:32.369 --> 02:34.284
The ligands are a wall of oil.

02:34.328 --> 02:37.287
And then we can kill Jones
without killing Max?

02:37.331 --> 02:38.767
Yeah, but first,
we have to find him.

02:38.810 --> 02:39.855
I mean, he was clinging

02:39.898 --> 02:40.986
onto that Lockhart Machine

02:41.030 --> 02:42.162
like it was a life raft.

02:42.205 --> 02:43.598
Clearly, he has a plan for it.

Alex thinks he wants
to make a call with it.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.299
It doesn't matter.

02:49.343 --> 02:51.388
We can use it
to gain an advantage over him.

02:51.432 --> 02:54.652
We know the Lockhart Machine
can send a signal out.

02:54.696 --> 02:55.871
Right?

02:55.914 --> 02:57.394
Well, Eduardo and Alex are
working on a way

02:57.438 --> 02:58.961
to send a signal to it.

02:59.744 --> 03:03.183

do they do that?

03:03.226 --> 03:05.054
With another one.

03:05.968 --> 03:08.492
Just like how the Valenti radios
are walkie-talkies of sorts.

03:08.536 --> 03:10.712
That same principle of
broadcasting could be used

03:10.755 --> 03:12.453
through the radio towers
in Roswell.

03:12.496 --> 03:13.758
To find Jones.

04:00.022 --> 04:01.589
What's in the bag?

04:01.632 --> 04:05.506
Well, apparently, Liz's science
gave us a ticking clock

04:05.549 --> 04:09.205
which now means that we have
to defeat Jones today.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.034
Which means we have to somehow

Humpty-Dumpty this thing
back together again.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.473
I think that the question
of fighting Jones

04:16.517 --> 04:19.084
has already been asked
and answered in the form

04:19.128 --> 04:21.043
of two dozen broken pieces.

04:21.086 --> 04:22.349
Are you saying that I'm weak?

04:22.392 --> 04:23.828
What I'm saying is
that maybe your strength

04:23.872 --> 04:25.569
has absolutely nothing
to do with this weapon.

04:25.613 --> 04:28.616
No, no. Liz and Michael
have all these ideas

04:28.659 --> 04:31.053
about how to stop him,
but everything except this sword

04:31.096 --> 04:34.143
is theoretical,
so, we just have to...

04:34.186 --> 04:36.928
Are you bleeding from your nose?

04:36.972 --> 04:38.452
What?

04:38.495 --> 04:40.062
Isobel, when was the last time
you slept?

04:40.105 --> 04:42.586
I don't know, Maria. It's
probably been, like, two days.

04:42.630 --> 04:44.414
But once the sword is intact,

04:44.458 --> 04:45.502
it holds energy,

04:45.546 --> 04:46.590
so I'll be able to draw off that

04:46.634 --> 04:47.765
and just keep going.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.332
As a descendant of Louise's,

04:49.376 --> 04:51.029
I can help Rosa

to block Max and Jones's

05:44.169 --> 05:46.302

together-- it's working.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.523
But the ligand molecules-- they
aren't generating fast enough

05:49.566 --> 05:51.394
to prevent Jones
from retethering.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.048
Once we get this compound
into Jones,

05:53.091 --> 05:55.355
we're gonna have seconds,
not hours, to kill him,

05:55.398 --> 05:57.052
without killing Max.

05:57.095 --> 05:59.359
So we need to find a faster way
to release this in Jones's body?

And he's had a plan since 1947

06:37.658 --> 06:39.442
to fix his genetics
and get off this rock.

06:39.486 --> 06:40.835
We can't let him

06:40.878 --> 06:42.837

that aliens could draw strength.

essentially their chosen family,

we descended from.

I'm not caught.

22:42.796 --> 22:44.406
I think
I'll just have a better view

22:44.450 --> 22:46.365
while I wait
for my plan to unfold.

22:46.408 --> 22:47.496
What are you talking about?

22:47.540 --> 22:49.193
I saw your plan to kill me

22:49.237 --> 22:50.760
in Eduardo's head.

22:53.763 --> 22:56.375
What could possibly be
so amusing?

22:56.418 --> 22:58.420
No. I'm just thinking about Max

22:58.464 --> 23:00.553
when he realizes
where he ended up.

23:00.596 --> 23:03.947
[groaning, gasping]

23:03.991 --> 23:05.296
Okay.Oh.

23:05.340 --> 23:07.168
Hey, no, no, no.
No, stay with me. Stay with me.

23:07.211 --> 23:08.169
Stay with me.

23:08.212 --> 23:10.519
[groans]

23:10.563 --> 23:12.521
[groaning]

23:12.565 --> 23:14.218
[groans][glass breaks]

23:14.262 --> 23:16.395
[gasping]Okay.

23:16.438 --> 23:17.874
You're okay. You're okay.
You're okay.

23:17.918 --> 23:18.788
I-I'm good?

23:18.832 --> 23:20.399
Okay, Max is on his way to Alex

23:20.442 --> 23:21.748
with the Lockhart Machine.

23:21.791 --> 23:23.924
He was able to save Eduardo
in the nick of time.

23:23.967 --> 23:25.926
Can't keep a good Valenti down.

23:33.934 --> 23:37.328
[laughs]
This is what you call a cavalry?

23:37.372 --> 23:39.635
What a sad lot.

23:39.679 --> 23:41.245
I have an opportunity.

23:41.289 --> 23:42.595
Who wants to make a deal?

23:42.638 --> 23:44.553
When I get out
of these restraints--

23:44.597 --> 23:46.250
and I will get out--

23:46.294 --> 23:48.775
whoever helps me survives.

23:52.082 --> 23:55.259
You keep trying to divide us,
but we stand together.

23:55.303 --> 23:56.957
Then you'll fall together.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.743
You'll fail while you assemble
this shoddy device.

24:00.787 --> 24:02.745
I mean, this radio is
as poorly constructed

24:02.789 --> 24:04.617
as the Lockhart Machine.

24:06.706 --> 24:09.099
You're wondering
if I turned it on.

24:09.143 --> 24:12.799
Then undo my restraints
and jump into my head, son.

24:12.842 --> 24:15.323
You'll see that
I called a vessel

24:15.366 --> 24:18.369
and those ready to navigate
once they reawaken.

24:18.413 --> 24:19.936
I think you're bluffing.

24:19.980 --> 24:22.722
Maybe once I'm gone,
you'll figure out how I escaped.

24:22.765 --> 24:24.419
Maybe you talk too much.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.855
JONES:
While we wait,

24:25.899 --> 24:29.163
have you figured out the mistake
my son made yet, Rosa?

24:29.206 --> 24:31.121
No?

24:31.165 --> 24:35.604
Okay. Then I'll conserve
my energy until the fun begins.

24:37.301 --> 24:39.608
So why are we drawing my blood?

24:39.652 --> 24:41.784
I thought...
I thought we had a time frame

24:41.828 --> 24:44.134
for, uh, when my DNA
is decoupled from Jones.

24:44.178 --> 24:46.963
Given we've got only
one shot at this,

24:47.007 --> 24:49.879
we need everything
to be exact.

24:51.098 --> 24:53.361
Which is why I'm
sure, genetically,

24:53.404 --> 24:55.189
our clock is on track.

24:57.191 --> 24:59.236
[whirring]

25:02.283 --> 25:04.067
You have any idea

25:04.111 --> 25:06.417
what our unwanted party guest
was referring to?

25:06.461 --> 25:10.552
This is my fifth rodeo,
but still don't know everything.

25:10.596 --> 25:12.336
Oh.

25:12.380 --> 25:13.642
Aah.

25:13.686 --> 25:14.991
ISOBEL:
Whoa, Rosa.

25:15.035 --> 25:17.167
Are you okay?
What do you hear?

25:17.211 --> 25:21.563
Uh, it sounds...

25:21.607 --> 25:25.045
loud and s... squeaky.

25:25.088 --> 25:27.264
Squeaky? Like bats?

25:27.308 --> 25:29.571
The Valenti radio uses infrared,

25:29.615 --> 25:33.183
which can mess
with the bats' echolocation.

25:33.227 --> 25:35.664
[bats squeaking]

25:35.708 --> 25:37.144
[gasping]

25:42.497 --> 25:44.151
[electrical pop]

25:46.370 --> 25:48.242
[high-pitched ringing]

25:48.285 --> 25:50.200
[groaning]

25:50.244 --> 25:52.420
Show me where the serum is.[groaning]

25:52.463 --> 25:54.074
[gasping]

25:56.467 --> 25:57.686
[grunts]

25:57.730 --> 25:58.992
[grunts][groans]

26:04.084 --> 26:06.782
Oh, Isobel, it's me.What? What?

26:06.826 --> 26:08.088
Iz, it's me. It's me. It's me.What?

26:08.131 --> 26:10.394
I was with Kyle.
Please, we got to...

26:10.438 --> 26:11.744
we got to swap me back.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.660
I'm gonna need that device.

26:16.226 --> 26:17.706
[grunts]

26:17.750 --> 26:19.578
I really don't want
to fight you,

26:19.621 --> 26:21.623
but I definitely can't give you
that alien box.

26:21.667 --> 26:24.583
[high-pitched ringing]

26:24.626 --> 26:25.845
I guess I'll kill you then.

26:25.888 --> 26:28.108
[clack, rhythmic clicking,
groaning]

26:31.938 --> 26:34.288
[groans]
Oh.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.247
Oh, today is not my day.

26:37.291 --> 26:39.249
Evans?
Aah.

26:39.293 --> 26:40.337
Is that really you?

26:40.381 --> 26:42.296
Yes! Damn it, Kyle, it's me!

26:48.345 --> 26:50.391
[groaning] [high-pitched ringing]

26:56.179 --> 26:58.704
[groans]

27:04.797 --> 27:10.367
[high-pitched ringing]

27:12.935 --> 27:16.199
You will never be
as powerful as your old man.

27:20.334 --> 27:22.249
[groans]

27:22.292 --> 27:23.424
[panting]

27:24.904 --> 27:28.211
Yeah, but he's got a pretty
clever circle of friends.

27:28.255 --> 27:29.343
[car approaching]

27:54.194 --> 27:55.674
Listen, Guerin,
we have 47 seconds

27:55.717 --> 27:56.805
until Jones can use this serum.

27:56.849 --> 27:58.328
And the woman I love
has the thing

27:58.372 --> 27:59.503
we need to end it.

27:59.547 --> 28:02.158
It's time
you hold my metaphorical beer.

28:02.202 --> 28:05.118
Well, Elizabeth, I told you I'd
get you to untangle me from Max.

28:05.161 --> 28:08.164
You will be.
On my terms.

28:08.208 --> 28:09.513
And then we're gonna kill you.

28:09.557 --> 28:13.692
[grunting]

28:13.735 --> 28:14.954
ISOBEL:
I wish Dallas were here.

28:14.997 --> 28:16.433
Theoretically,
he can control water.

28:16.477 --> 28:19.001
I have a fire
extinguisher in the car.

28:19.045 --> 28:21.395
What?!I'm a registered EMT.

28:21.438 --> 28:22.701
Valenti, go get it!

28:22.744 --> 28:24.790
[grunting]

28:26.661 --> 28:28.097
[grunts]

28:29.882 --> 28:32.711
[high-pitched ringing]

28:33.755 --> 28:35.365
[grunting]

28:38.629 --> 28:40.283
Isobel!

28:41.720 --> 28:44.070
[grunting]

28:51.860 --> 28:53.993
Your body will still be mine.

28:54.036 --> 28:56.082
Michael, are you okay?

28:56.125 --> 28:59.346
No way in hell
you win today.

29:01.696 --> 29:04.830
[electrical hissing]

29:04.873 --> 29:06.396
[gasps]

29:06.440 --> 29:07.876
[grunts]

29:07.920 --> 29:09.748
[electrical hissing]

29:14.013 --> 29:16.102
[electrical hum][gasps]

29:16.145 --> 29:17.756
[sighs]

29:17.799 --> 29:19.235
[panting]

29:21.803 --> 29:24.414
ISOBEL: How do we tell
which one is Max?
I'm Max.

29:24.458 --> 29:26.329
Of course you'd say that.I can prove it.

29:26.373 --> 29:27.766
The secret ingredient
to Space jam.

29:27.809 --> 29:29.202
It's kumquat rinds.

29:30.377 --> 29:33.119
Liz, it's me.
Look in my eyes.

29:38.689 --> 29:41.475
There's too much fear
coming off all of us.

29:41.518 --> 29:42.781
I can't get a read
on their auras.

29:42.824 --> 29:43.782
What about you, Rosa?

29:43.825 --> 29:45.087
Can you get a frequency?

29:45.131 --> 29:46.436
Uh, they're standing
too close together

29:46.480 --> 29:47.873
for me to make it out.

29:50.658 --> 29:53.835
Maria? You got Big Bob on you?

29:53.879 --> 29:55.141
Yup.

29:55.968 --> 29:57.665
I'll get it.

29:57.708 --> 29:59.362
That-that's a bad idea, Liz.

29:59.406 --> 30:00.973
No, it's a good one.

30:01.887 --> 30:03.976
I trust you, Liz.

30:15.074 --> 30:16.727
What was
our first lab experiment

30:16.771 --> 30:19.208
in high school biology class?

30:19.252 --> 30:21.820
Uh, dissecting a salamander?

30:21.863 --> 30:22.995
You nicknamed him "Sammy."

30:23.038 --> 30:23.996
Yeah, you laughed at me 'cause

30:24.039 --> 30:25.345
I couldn't make the first cut.

30:29.610 --> 30:31.438
[sighs]

30:36.747 --> 30:39.141
When's the first time
you were in my bedroom?

30:39.185 --> 30:41.274
I've never been there.

30:41.317 --> 30:43.102
I was... I was gonna go once,
but I got nervous,

30:43.145 --> 30:44.364
and I blew up
the milkshake machine.

30:44.407 --> 30:45.887
Oh, I was just afraid
of your dad,

30:45.931 --> 30:47.976
so I made up an excuse,
and I left.

31:03.426 --> 31:05.776
What song was playing
on my Walkman

31:05.820 --> 31:08.562
at the playground
the day we met?

31:14.176 --> 31:16.396
"Sledgehammer."

31:16.439 --> 31:18.137
Peter Gabriel.

31:18.964 --> 31:20.922
That's it.

31:20.966 --> 31:23.011
That's the song.

31:25.971 --> 31:27.537
I knew you'd show yourself.

31:27.581 --> 31:28.930
No, no, no. Liz.

31:28.974 --> 31:30.758
[gunshot, loud gasps]

31:30.801 --> 31:31.802
What?

31:31.846 --> 31:33.239
[gasps]

31:33.282 --> 31:36.111
[coughing]

31:39.288 --> 31:42.944
You said that song
is somewhere in your head,

31:42.988 --> 31:45.468
but all you can remember
are my eyes.

31:45.512 --> 31:47.209
Yeah.

31:49.211 --> 31:50.734
[grunting][shrieks]

31:50.778 --> 31:52.693
ISOBEL:Michael, don't let
him jump back in.

31:54.782 --> 31:56.827
[grunts]

31:56.871 --> 31:58.394
[gasps]

31:58.438 --> 32:00.222
[grunts]

32:00.266 --> 32:02.616
[gasps]

32:08.578 --> 32:11.364
[groans][panting]

32:12.104 --> 32:14.410
[guttural groan]

32:17.936 --> 32:20.590
[sighs][panting]

32:20.634 --> 32:22.723
[panting]

32:25.944 --> 32:29.034
[sighs, sniffles]

32:36.563 --> 32:39.000
[truck approaches,
doors open]

32:39.044 --> 32:41.307
[truck doors close]

32:43.700 --> 32:46.268
Please tell me you know there
is only one "L" in "Michael"

32:46.312 --> 32:47.966
for the hero of your
next secret novel.

32:48.009 --> 32:50.707
All right. Thank you
for letting me know.

32:50.751 --> 32:53.014
I, uh... I got this for you.

32:53.058 --> 32:54.973
No.Brother!

32:55.016 --> 32:57.932
Please tell me we are not
all getting a sappy letter.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.152
Yeah, let's stop
looking backwards.

33:00.195 --> 33:02.676
We, uh... No.

33:02.719 --> 33:05.940
This is my secret
acetone margarita recipe.

33:05.984 --> 33:06.985
Mm.[gasps]

33:07.028 --> 33:10.640
At last! Yes! Mmm.

33:10.684 --> 33:11.990
Thank you.

33:12.816 --> 33:14.427
So maybe

33:14.470 --> 33:16.516
while you mix up
the next pitcher...ISOBEL: Okay.

33:16.559 --> 33:18.474
...we can discuss
what to do with Jones' body?

33:18.518 --> 33:20.999
Mm-hmm.Ah. You want to give it
to Liz, don't you?

33:21.042 --> 33:22.478
Yeah, I do, but I...

33:22.522 --> 33:25.220
I think it's something we should
discuss. No more secrets.

33:25.264 --> 33:27.701
And there's someone
who should also have a vote.

33:28.876 --> 33:31.052
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

33:31.096 --> 33:34.838
Yeah, Heath had
a very long confessional.

33:34.882 --> 33:38.103
How is, uh,
Liz's Work Max doing?

33:38.886 --> 33:40.496
He's all right.

33:40.540 --> 33:43.151
You know, he's got a lot
of soul-searching to do,

33:43.195 --> 33:44.761
but nothing a few mai tais

33:44.805 --> 33:47.025
or a long look on
the mirror can't fix.

33:47.068 --> 33:48.330
Mm.

33:48.374 --> 33:49.984
Well, it's not a mai tai.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.507
Mmm.Okay.

33:51.551 --> 33:52.682
Try this.

33:52.726 --> 33:54.989
Okay. Thank you.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.730
I'm so thirsty.
Thank you.Mmm.

33:56.773 --> 33:58.819
Mmm.ISOBEL:
Mmm.

33:58.862 --> 34:01.256
That's different,
but it's good, though.

34:01.300 --> 34:03.041
It's 'cause
it's got acetone in it.

34:03.084 --> 34:04.564
What?!

34:06.261 --> 34:07.784
We have a lot
to share with you.

34:12.441 --> 34:14.400
Hey.

34:14.443 --> 34:15.314
Hey.

34:15.357 --> 34:17.794
Arturo said you would be here.

34:19.796 --> 34:22.103
Oh. What is this?

34:22.147 --> 34:23.931
You know I don't like surprises.

34:23.974 --> 34:26.238
Mm, Rosa doesn't.

34:26.281 --> 34:28.327
Maybe Rosalinda does.

34:29.197 --> 34:30.677
I asked our new
clandestine uncle

34:30.720 --> 34:31.852
for a favor.

34:31.895 --> 34:33.636
You are officially

34:33.680 --> 34:35.899
Rosalinda Ortecho,
who, I might add,

34:35.943 --> 34:38.728
is actually going on a trip
to New York for a few months.

34:40.252 --> 34:42.950
[sighs]
Oh, my God.

34:42.993 --> 34:46.388
I thought you would be
a little less dour.

34:46.432 --> 34:49.130
No, no, no.
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm...

34:49.174 --> 34:51.480
I'm all fireworks
on the inside. I just,

34:51.524 --> 34:53.569
um... I...

34:53.613 --> 34:55.919
I just got this flash of worry.

34:55.963 --> 34:58.226
You know, like...
