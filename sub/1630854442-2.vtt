WEBVTT

00:15.140 --> 00:16.433
Mom!

00:16.933 --> 00:18.393
I think something happened to Dad.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.770
What? No! I would've heard something.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.946
- Santa's down! Santa's down!
- Do you hear me?

00:29.946 --> 00:32.282
- What are we gonna do?
- Everybody, calm down!

00:32.282 --> 00:35.410
Santa, Santa, do you copy? Santa?

00:35.410 --> 00:37.287
- Noel?
- What's happening?

00:37.287 --> 00:38.788
We've got a Code Sprinkle.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.707
Thank God! I thought it was something bad.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.459
It means Santa's down.

00:42.459 --> 00:43.918
- What?
- Christmas is ruined!

00:43.918 --> 00:45.670
Why would you name it something so cute?

01:12.572 --> 01:14.074
<i>Is this really it?</i>

01:14.574 --> 01:16.618
<i>All the things I never got to do.</i>

01:17.160 --> 01:19.496
<i>The Christmases I never had
with my family.</i>

01:19.996 --> 01:21.706
<i>I just hope Carol doesn't remarry.</i>

01:22.791 --> 01:25.168
Forgive me, Santa,
for what I'm about to do.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.213
Wake up!

01:28.213 --> 01:29.964
Ow.

01:29.964 --> 01:31.257
Why are you yelling?

01:31.257 --> 01:33.927
Because when my best friend's laying
on the ground non-responsive

01:33.927 --> 01:36.596
for 15 minutes, I yell!

01:36.596 --> 01:38.264
Did I rip my sack?

01:38.264 --> 01:39.766
No, it's still up on the roof.

01:39.766 --> 01:40.850
Oh, good.

01:40.850 --> 01:43.937
Let's go, but don't tell anybody
I fell off the roof.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.355
Got it. No one but Betty.

01:45.355 --> 01:46.731
Not Betty. Nobody.

01:46.731 --> 01:49.359
Right. I won't tell a soul,
except Mrs. Claus--

01:49.359 --> 01:50.777
Not Mrs. Claus.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.695
- And Betty.
- Not Betty.

01:52.695 --> 01:55.323
- Doc Martin.
- No. Not my doctor. No one.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.872
No, no, no!
Cut the bubbles! Cut the bubbles!

02:02.872 --> 02:05.542
Everyone, there's been an incident.
Oh, my gosh! No, no, no!

02:05.542 --> 02:08.002
Hide the cake! Hide the cake!
Back, back, back!

02:08.002 --> 02:09.754
Everyone, be quiet! Everybody, quiet!

02:09.754 --> 02:12.382
There's been an incident,
but don't panic! Okay? Don't panic.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.592
I say don't panic,
but I'm totally panicking!

02:15.885 --> 02:18.179
Okay, everyone, this way, this way!

02:18.179 --> 02:20.348
Let's give them some space.
Let's give them some space.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.350
Come on! This way, this way.
Going, going, going...

02:22.350 --> 02:24.811
Oh, Scott! We were so worried again.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.646
Oh, gosh. Do you mean about tonight?

02:26.646 --> 02:27.939
- Yeah.
- You know me.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.607
The world's greatest showman.

02:29.607 --> 02:31.609
I was just goofing on everybody.

02:31.609 --> 02:32.735
We should be celebrating.

02:32.735 --> 02:34.988
Where's all the music and merriment?

02:34.988 --> 02:37.031
- What happened up there tonight?
- It's not a big deal.

02:37.031 --> 02:38.449
Nothing, Butter Cake.

02:38.449 --> 02:40.201
Everything was super-duper.

02:40.201 --> 02:41.661
Peachy keen.

02:41.661 --> 02:42.912
Hunky-dory.

02:42.912 --> 02:44.455
Easy as pie.

02:44.455 --> 02:45.540
Boffo.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.292
Gangbusters.

02:47.292 --> 02:48.668
Dope.

02:48.668 --> 02:51.588
- Noel.
- Not cracking. Not cracking.

02:51.588 --> 02:52.672
Just tell her.

02:53.506 --> 02:56.384
- The Big Man fell off the roof!
- Oh, Scott.

02:56.384 --> 02:59.762
It was horrible!
My whole life flashed before my eyes!

03:00.263 --> 03:01.639
Santa was in it more than you.

03:01.639 --> 03:04.017
He never said, "I love you," but I knew.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.311
I'm so sorry I lied to you!

03:09.689 --> 03:12.442
We need to talk about something,
in private.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.155
- Better now?
- No.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.948
Give me my reading glasses.
Where are they?

03:18.948 --> 03:20.533
They're on your face.

03:22.118 --> 03:23.203
Better now?

03:23.786 --> 03:24.787
Yeah, there we go.

03:25.496 --> 03:28.208
The Seuss-uses. Seuss-uses Clause?

03:28.208 --> 03:30.084
What in the green eggs and ham is that?

03:30.084 --> 03:32.837
- Not "seuss-uses." "Secessus."
- Seuss-and-says.

03:32.837 --> 03:34.172
- Secessus.
- Seuss-a-sesses.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.924
- Secessus!
- Gesundheit.

03:35.924 --> 03:39.594
It means "retirement" in Latin,
aka throwing in the towel,

03:39.594 --> 03:41.638
- giving up, not being Santa anymore...
- I understand.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.723
...spending your life sitting around
and yelling at the TV.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.684
Right, I understand what retirement is.
Why am I looking at this?

03:46.684 --> 03:48.019
Did you read the fine print?

03:48.019 --> 03:50.480
There isn't a magnifying glass big enough.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.858
To summarize,
it's an addendum to the Santa Clause,

03:53.858 --> 03:55.902
giving Santa a clean way out

03:55.902 --> 03:59.822
if he no longer has the capacity
and/or desire to do the job anymore.

04:05.495 --> 04:11.626
So... me not being Santa anymore?

04:12.126 --> 04:13.127
Hmm?

04:14.879 --> 04:16.798
Mm-hmm.

04:35.775 --> 04:39.070
Can you believe Betty suggested
that I retire?

04:39.070 --> 04:42.031
Santa? Retire?
Can you imagine such a thing?

04:42.031 --> 04:43.199
Are you packing?

04:43.199 --> 04:48.579
No! I'm just, you know, seeing if I have
any of my pre-Mrs. Claus clothes in here.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.708
So, you and I retire.

04:52.208 --> 04:53.459
Living in an RV.

04:53.459 --> 04:57.130
Big step down from what I've been
driving around here for 29 years.

04:57.130 --> 05:00.133
Hey. I love it here. I really do.

05:00.133 --> 05:04.554
But sometimes I think that
it might be nice to try something new.

05:04.554 --> 05:07.098
To be able to let my hair down. Literally.

05:07.098 --> 05:10.727
I know why. You feel marginalized here
as Mrs. Claus. I get that, you know?

05:10.727 --> 05:13.604
But think about how many popcorn tins
you've had that beautiful face on.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.231
Yeah, you mean like that one.

05:15.231 --> 05:17.692
- Yeah.
- Yeah? [chuckles] Okay.

05:17.692 --> 05:21.529
So, this is exactly how I'm perceived.

05:22.113 --> 05:25.116
Dumpy, void of all personality and appeal,

05:25.116 --> 05:28.244
and somehow humorless
while still providing comic relief.

05:28.244 --> 05:31.497
That reindeer loves those bloomers.

05:34.584 --> 05:38.296
I'm not saying that I want to leave...

05:38.296 --> 05:39.380
Hmm.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.632
...but last night was a wake-up call.

05:41.632 --> 05:43.843
You fell off a roof, and I didn't like it.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.261
- You didn't like it?
- No.

05:45.261 --> 05:46.971
I fell on a sprinkler, honey.

05:46.971 --> 05:49.390
This is the second year in a row
something bad has happened.

05:49.390 --> 05:52.268
The kids were worried. Even Cal was aware
that something was wrong.

05:52.268 --> 05:53.478
- Cal?
- Yeah.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.604
- Aware?
- Mm-hmm.

05:54.604 --> 05:57.315
I'm not sure that kid's aware
that he wears pj's all the time.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.567
I know. He just had a feeling.

05:59.567 --> 06:00.902
That's weird.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.945
Wait a minute. Just slipped my mind.

06:02.945 --> 06:05.073
- Okay.
- I have kids.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.616
How hard did you hit your head?

06:06.616 --> 06:08.659
I think I have a way
for me to find a new Santa

06:08.659 --> 06:10.370
and still stay here at the North Pole.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.788
I gotta tell Betty.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.915
Scott! You still have your pajamas on!

06:13.915 --> 06:14.999
Okay then!

06:15.875 --> 06:16.876
Never mind.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.586
Hey, Betty. Betty, Betty.

06:18.586 --> 06:20.213
You in here? Hey.

06:20.838 --> 06:22.840
Santa, you're in your pajamas.

06:22.840 --> 06:23.925
Oh, I get it.

06:24.425 --> 06:25.968
You're saying I'm senile, right?

06:25.968 --> 06:28.096
That's your way to push me
into retirement.

06:28.096 --> 06:31.015
I'm not forcing you.
I merely pointed out an option.

06:31.015 --> 06:33.142
- Ah.
- It's better than you having an accident.

06:33.142 --> 06:34.685
Putting me out of my misery, huh?

06:34.685 --> 06:37.063
Don't think I haven't noticed
how you've been looking at me.

06:37.063 --> 06:40.066
It's just the way I look, sir.
I've been told it's unsettling.

06:40.066 --> 06:43.361
Hmm. Listen.
I'm not saying I'm gonna retire.

06:43.361 --> 06:46.197
The only thing I hate more than gardening
is garden gnomes.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.365
Gnomes.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.867
If I were to retire, how would that work?

06:50.368 --> 06:52.328
The Secessus Clause states that

06:52.328 --> 06:55.248
you may step down once
you've effectively completed your mission.

06:55.248 --> 06:58.000
Well, if my mission was to be awesome,
I've already accomplished that.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.919
And chosen a proper successor.

06:59.919 --> 07:03.548
So, the Secessus Clause has
a successor subsection.

07:04.048 --> 07:05.049
Sensational.

07:05.049 --> 07:07.760
Are you actually considering this?
Retirement?

07:07.760 --> 07:10.513
I know it's big news. Probably dramatic.
I'll give you some time.

07:10.513 --> 07:13.182
- I want you to think about it.
- Here's a list of possible replacements.

07:13.182 --> 07:14.392
Give me a break.

07:14.976 --> 07:17.770
You just found out
about this Sausalito Clause yesterday.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.605
It's my job to be efficient.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.276
Well, listen.
I think I can save us both a lot of time.

07:23.776 --> 07:25.403
I already picked my replacement.

07:25.987 --> 07:26.988
Charlie.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.994
Where are all the grown-ups?

07:32.994 --> 07:35.079
This is so cool!

07:35.079 --> 07:37.123
He's been to the North Pole many times,
you know?

07:37.123 --> 07:38.541
He's done the rounds with me.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.585
He's always wanted to be
in the family business.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.462
It's almost too perfect.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.755
Yeah, too perfect, like that's a thing.

07:44.755 --> 07:46.424
Come on, Betty. Go with me on this.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.009
We bring him in early, huh?

07:48.009 --> 07:50.094
He already knows how things work
in the real world.

07:50.094 --> 07:53.222
He can handle the trickier roofs.
I can stay at the North Pole.

07:53.222 --> 07:56.225
It could be Santa Claus and Son.

07:56.225 --> 07:58.352
Two Santas? Ugh. This isn't the Vatican.

07:58.352 --> 08:00.313
- Santa! There you are.
- Hey.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.732
- Love the pj's.
- The what?

08:03.691 --> 08:06.527
Why didn't you tell me
I was in my pajamas?

08:12.408 --> 08:13.910
Question!

08:13.910 --> 08:18.206
If you could have anything in the world,
what would it be?

08:18.789 --> 08:22.126
Aspirin. Because I get a headache
every time you talk.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.340
Well, in about three minutes,
your headache's gonna be history.

08:27.340 --> 08:31.886
Now, you all know my esteemed colleague
and butterfly-kisses-giver, Grace.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.679
Hi.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.432
Now, Grace here represents
today's consumer. So, I'll ask her.

08:37.016 --> 08:38.601
- What is it you want?
- Everything.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.436
- And when do you want it?
- Now!

08:40.436 --> 08:41.437
Very cute.

08:41.437 --> 08:44.440
Look, as a tech innovator and toymaker,
you're a genius,

08:44.440 --> 08:46.567
which is why we invested in your company.

08:46.567 --> 08:49.445
But your management ineptitude
is costing us greatly.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.739
- Hmm.
- I've had to Airbnb my yacht.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.824
It smells like nachos now.

08:53.824 --> 08:56.577
- That's why we called this meeting.
- I thought we called this meeting.

08:56.577 --> 08:59.830
If you can't turn things around quickly,
we're cutting you off.

08:59.830 --> 09:03.751
That's why we're here,
to, uh, show you our new delivery system.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.170
Drones.

09:08.297 --> 09:11.759
Every company has tried drones.
The cons far outweigh the pros.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.636
Well, my drones are different.

09:14.303 --> 09:17.473
They're faster, wily, self-learning.

09:17.473 --> 09:21.310
They scope and assess the most
efficient way to deliver an order.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.646
It'll even drive Santa Claus
out of business.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.649
And just like Santa Claus,
none of what you're saying is real.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.317
Come on. Not in front of the kid, okay?

09:28.317 --> 09:30.027
What? She's old enough to hear the truth.

09:30.027 --> 09:33.781
Your daddy can't deliver on his promises.
Only headaches.

09:34.907 --> 09:37.159
I'll accept your apology in 20 seconds.

09:37.159 --> 09:39.537
Here's your aspirin.

09:42.164 --> 09:43.666
Now how did you do that so fast?

09:43.666 --> 09:45.626
I told you, my drones are special.

09:45.626 --> 09:48.921
And once we have fulfillment centers
in every hundred-mile radius,

09:48.921 --> 09:52.425
we're gonna be able to promise delivery
in 60 minutes or less.

09:54.176 --> 09:55.511
Okay.

09:57.638 --> 09:59.849
Oh, uh, no, no, no.
G-Go around. Uh, uh--

09:59.849 --> 10:01.392
Detour! Detour! Go around!

10:01.392 --> 10:02.560
Detour! No!

10:02.560 --> 10:04.103
No!

10:16.699 --> 10:18.034
Ta-da!

10:18.743 --> 10:21.454
Get out of here. Now!

10:30.129 --> 10:32.465
Whoo!

10:35.384 --> 10:36.469
Hey, Dad!

10:36.469 --> 10:37.928
Charlie.

10:37.928 --> 10:39.930
- Good to see you!
- Good to see you too.

10:39.930 --> 10:40.973
Come on in.

10:41.557 --> 10:46.145
So, uh, I read your icicle,
and I'm excited to hear this big news.

10:46.145 --> 10:49.649
I didn't mean to make it mysterious.
I wanted to see your face when I told you.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.400
I'm liking the new duds too.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.694
Let me guess.
You just opened Jurassic Park?

10:53.694 --> 10:56.447
Yes. And the velociraptors are this way.

10:57.448 --> 11:00.117
Wow, you really have lost weight.
You weren't kidding.

11:00.117 --> 11:02.787
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's actually become kind of a nightmare.

11:02.787 --> 11:06.207
They've lowered all the flags
at the North Pole buffet to half-staff.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.875
And I'm losing magic.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.211
Yeah. You mentioned that. I'm sorry, Dad.

11:10.211 --> 11:14.006
Well, listen, my loss could be your gain,
but before we start talking about this,

11:14.006 --> 11:16.050
I think I have some grandkids
to say "hi" to.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.760
- Yay, Grandpa!
- There's my guys!

11:17.760 --> 11:19.804
Big, two wonderful boys. Look at this.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.430
Why are you so wet, Grandpa?

11:21.430 --> 11:23.683
I'm like a washcloth, aren't I?
I'm kind of soppy--

11:23.683 --> 11:26.268
Guys, Grandpa's not used to the heat.

11:26.268 --> 11:28.979
No. [chuckles] At all.

11:28.979 --> 11:32.274
Lemonade just the way you like it.
No lemon, extra sugar.

11:32.274 --> 11:34.402
Oh.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.404
My favorite daughter-in-law.

11:36.404 --> 11:39.573
Although, I'd probably say that to anybody
bringing me this right about now.

11:41.992 --> 11:42.993
Okay.

11:44.328 --> 11:45.454
Here's why I'm here.

11:46.038 --> 11:49.417
I am retiring, and I want you
to take over the family business

11:49.417 --> 11:51.836
just like you've always wanted to.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.172
Uh. Wow.

11:55.172 --> 11:57.216
Um. Retirement.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.260
I didn't even know you could do that.

11:59.260 --> 12:02.054
Good for you. This is-- This is--

12:02.054 --> 12:04.056
- This is gigantic news, right? Yeah.
- Yes.

12:04.056 --> 12:07.226
I mean, I don't--
I don't really know what to say.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.310
No.

12:08.811 --> 12:09.812
Say no.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.231
Sorry, Scott, I have a career here.

12:12.231 --> 12:15.776
I'm not moving to Greenland
to catch and sell shrimp.

12:17.486 --> 12:20.448
Can I have a moment with Charlie?
Privately. Just one moment.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.324
- Babe, give us a sec.
- Nope. Uh-uh.

12:22.324 --> 12:24.326
- Just one sec.
-'Cause you'll do anything for him.

12:24.326 --> 12:26.454
- Just--
- I'm not raising my kids on a trawler.

12:26.454 --> 12:29.165
Smelly, damp, swearing sea children.

12:29.165 --> 12:32.042
And what about me?
I get seasick standing on the beach.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.086
No. No! The answer's no!

12:34.712 --> 12:37.673
Huh. You haven't told her.
I can't believe you haven't told her.

12:37.673 --> 12:39.633
I've been waiting
to find the right moment,

12:39.633 --> 12:42.928
but there's not really a good moment
to say, "My dad's Santa Claus."

12:42.928 --> 12:45.514
Now's a pretty good moment.
Otherwise, she'll be at the North Pole

12:45.514 --> 12:48.184
and wonder why
people are calling her Mrs. Claus.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.144
A-About that, Dad.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.605
Look, I-I love you.

12:52.605 --> 12:56.525
And I cherish all the time we had
in the sleigh together.

12:56.525 --> 13:00.154
But... it's just asking a lot.

13:00.154 --> 13:03.032
Is this because of Marie?
I mean, come on. She'll warm up to it.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.950
- Not literally--
- It's not that, Dad.

13:05.659 --> 13:08.662
Okay, it's-- it's the North Pole.

13:08.662 --> 13:12.374
It's just--
It's not the best place to raise kids.

13:12.374 --> 13:13.667
Oh, stop.

13:13.667 --> 13:16.712
North Pole is like a circus mixed
with a zoo and a playground

13:16.712 --> 13:18.214
on top of a Tilt-A-Whirl.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.590
- That's my point.
- What?

13:19.590 --> 13:21.133
It's just too much.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.844
Cal and Sandra are okay.

13:24.678 --> 13:25.679
Are they though?

13:26.472 --> 13:28.974
You do know that
I've spent time with them, right?

13:28.974 --> 13:30.726
And th-that's not a criticism.

13:30.726 --> 13:32.728
I mean, you're-- you're a great father.

13:33.312 --> 13:34.563
It's the job though.

13:34.563 --> 13:38.567
It's just-- It's not conducive
to being an engaged parent.

13:39.276 --> 13:40.277
Hmm.

13:42.530 --> 13:46.367
I came down here
with this dream in my head

13:46.367 --> 13:48.536
that we'd work together
for a couple of years.

13:48.536 --> 13:49.662
I'd teach you the ropes,

13:49.662 --> 13:52.122
and then you'd take over
when I couldn't do it.

13:52.122 --> 13:54.291
It was just something
I was thinking about.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.001
I'm sorry, Dad.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.171
Thanks for asking me though.
It means the world.

13:59.171 --> 14:00.256
Come here.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.633
I love you so much,
and I'll be all right. It'll work out.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.719
Okay. I am starting to think
you don't run a shrimp company.

14:06.303 --> 14:08.264
No, no, no.
Do you remember when we first met?

14:08.264 --> 14:10.015
We were at that seafood restaurant?

14:10.015 --> 14:12.601
Someone's eating shrimp next to us,
so I thought of shrimp.

14:12.601 --> 14:14.687
- That's the best I could come up with.
- So you lied.

14:14.687 --> 14:18.274
Which means that you're
either in the CIA or the mob.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.025
- No, no, no, no.
- No, no. It's not--

14:20.025 --> 14:22.361
Listen, it's actually crazier than that,

14:22.361 --> 14:25.573
and Charlie is gonna have a great time
explaining it to you after I'm gone

14:25.573 --> 14:27.533
because I have a deer to catch.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.369
And I already know what the boys want
for Christmas next year!

14:30.369 --> 14:31.912
- Thanks, Dad.
- Talk.

14:32.913 --> 14:34.915
I'm gonna miss the endless cider.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.375
You know what I won't miss?

14:36.876 --> 14:37.918
Velvet capes.

14:37.918 --> 14:41.005
I don't like wearing anything
that Ozzy Osbourne wore better.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.591
Well, I'll miss our cider o'clock.

14:43.591 --> 14:45.050
Me too.

14:46.594 --> 14:49.889
So, can I ask you something
about the previous Mrs. Claus?

14:49.889 --> 14:52.349
I'm not allowed to discuss
those who came before.

14:52.349 --> 14:55.436
I've never understood
the secrecy around here.

14:55.436 --> 14:58.397
Who am I going to tell?
I don't know any people.

14:59.940 --> 15:05.112
Santa is Santa, always and forever,
a continuum, not an individual.

15:05.654 --> 15:09.199
Thus, there are no past Santas,
and the same for Mrs. Claus.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.243
I don't make the rules.

15:11.243 --> 15:14.079
I just enforce them
with steadfast intensity.

15:14.079 --> 15:16.206
You know who would be a great Santa?

15:16.206 --> 15:17.291
You.

15:17.875 --> 15:18.918
Elves can't be Santa.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.795
More weird rules.
This place would crumble without you.

15:22.796 --> 15:23.923
I'm just happy to serve.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.716
Besides, it's going to be Charlie.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.176
Charlie's out!

15:28.719 --> 15:29.970
Said didn't wanna do it.

15:29.970 --> 15:33.098
He doesn't think the North Pole
is the best place to raise children.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.391
Am I doing this to our kids?

15:34.391 --> 15:38.020
- No, you are a terrific dad.
- Yeah.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.689
Raising kids at the North Pole
is challenging.

15:40.689 --> 15:42.232
- Exactly. Yeah.
- Yes! I mean,

15:42.232 --> 15:45.527
that's probably why Cal is lost
in his imaginary virtual world.

15:45.527 --> 15:48.530
- He's not lost. I wouldn't say lost.
- And how Sandra only likes animals.

15:48.530 --> 15:51.367
We did a study on human kids raised here,

15:51.367 --> 15:55.746
and the conclusion is that
they turn out very weird.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.957
Well, how many kids have been raised here?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.917
- Including Cal and Sandra?
- Yeah.

16:00.584 --> 16:01.627
Two.

16:01.627 --> 16:02.920
- What?
- What?

16:02.920 --> 16:05.255
I think I've had too much cider.
I have to go.

16:05.255 --> 16:08.008
No, wait! No, no more secrets.

16:08.008 --> 16:10.427
Tell us who came before and, hey!

16:10.427 --> 16:14.306
Why does Mrs. Claus have to look
like a timeworn, overstuffed armchair?

16:17.685 --> 16:20.062
Sometimes I feel like
I'm not heard around here.

16:20.729 --> 16:23.232
You're totally right.
I gotta spend more time with the kids.

16:24.483 --> 16:25.818
That's not what I said.

16:27.736 --> 16:31.365
It's beautiful up here.
This just never gets old.

16:31.365 --> 16:32.491
Isn't this--

16:32.491 --> 16:35.369
Hey, take the goggles off, please.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.456
What are we doing out here, Dad?

16:39.456 --> 16:40.666
- Am I in trouble?
- No.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.459
You only spend time with me
when I'm in trouble.

16:42.459 --> 16:45.462
That's not true.
I took you ice fishing that one time. Huh?

16:45.462 --> 16:48.632
I thought that's because I was in trouble.
It was so horrible.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.427
That's the problem
with this VR stuff, you know?

16:51.427 --> 16:54.638
You spend so much time in virtual reality.
Look where you live!

16:54.638 --> 16:56.932
You live at the North Pole.
It's a magical place.

16:56.932 --> 16:58.684
Kids everywhere would kill to live here.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.269
Scary.

17:01.311 --> 17:02.896
Hey, speaking of killing,

17:02.896 --> 17:07.192
you ever think about if some psycho
learns about the Santa Clause

17:07.192 --> 17:09.278
and sets a trap out for your coat?

17:10.362 --> 17:11.488
All the time.

17:11.488 --> 17:14.491
I think about it too
when I have dreams where I'm Santa.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.578
You have dreams that you're Santa?

17:17.578 --> 17:20.497
Yeah, super vivid dreams, yeah.

17:20.497 --> 17:22.791
That's amazing.
I never even thought of that.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.918
That could be the answer
to all my problems.

17:24.918 --> 17:26.837
We could keep it in the family.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.798
I wouldn't have to leave.
We could start now.

17:29.798 --> 17:31.508
You're getting this crazy look
in your eye.

17:31.508 --> 17:32.968
I could teach you how to drive.

17:32.968 --> 17:35.387
- I already know how to drive.
- Here you go. Hold on to those.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.347
Where are the buttons? I need a console.

17:37.347 --> 17:40.309
If you wanna go, all you do--
Just pull on this one.

17:41.643 --> 17:43.937
- Good. A bit more. More. No, not--
- Whoa! Whoa!

17:43.937 --> 17:47.066
Ho ho! Here we go!

17:47.775 --> 17:48.776
Look into the turn.

17:48.776 --> 17:49.777
What?

17:49.777 --> 17:51.987
Look where you wanna go,
not where you don't wanna be.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.156
Come on. There you go.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.783
You wanna steer into it a little bit.

17:56.950 --> 17:59.453
You're doing all right. You're doing good.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.872
I really hate this.
I wanna go back to my computer now.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.791
If you wanna land,
you just pull back a little.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.459
Pull back a little bit. Pull it back.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.187
Boys, come on! [clicks tongue] Come on.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.272
Hey, you okay? That was a great fall!

18:27.272 --> 18:28.607
Why did you make me do that?

18:28.607 --> 18:30.526
My magic's been failing
a little bit lately,

18:30.526 --> 18:32.027
and so I'm thinking about retiring.

18:32.027 --> 18:34.279
You were talking about your dreams
of being Santa--

18:34.279 --> 18:37.533
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I never said they were good dreams.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.745
They're kinda like the last few minutes,
confusing and terrifying.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.625
Blitzen, Comet, shake it off.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.043
Sweet relief!

18:48.544 --> 18:50.838
If you're really looking for a new Santa,

18:50.838 --> 18:53.048
you should get the guy
who makes these games.

18:53.048 --> 18:55.467
Talk about bringing happiness
in the world.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.136
You know what I'm saying, Dad?

18:58.804 --> 18:59.972
Dad.

19:04.601 --> 19:05.686
Where is this?

19:06.436 --> 19:08.814
The nerve of those guys.
They wanna cut me off?

19:08.814 --> 19:11.358
I'll cut them off,
leave them all in the dust.

19:11.358 --> 19:14.153
You're doing that thing
where you get all crazy-eyed like Grandpa.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.405
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie. You're right.

19:16.905 --> 19:20.617
I shouldn't let those guys get to me.
I just need to fix our delivery problems.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.162
- I believe in you, Dad.
- Oh.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.247
Thank you, sweetie.
That's all that matters.

19:26.081 --> 19:27.416
Hey, what's this?

19:29.126 --> 19:30.127
My Christmas gift.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.298
Oh, honey.

19:35.382 --> 19:37.718
I miss her too, every day.

19:38.218 --> 19:40.012
But I'm confused. Where'd you get that?

19:40.012 --> 19:43.599
I told you.
It was under the tree from Santa.

19:44.433 --> 19:47.269
I know you don't believe in Santa,
like those men today.

19:47.895 --> 19:48.896
That's okay.

19:49.855 --> 19:53.066
Well, I didn't, um, but, uh...

19:53.066 --> 19:55.152
Wait a minute. You saw him?

19:55.152 --> 19:56.403
I see it in your face.

19:56.403 --> 19:59.072
Well, I saw something.
I don't know. It makes no sense.

19:59.072 --> 20:01.533
First, the mysterious other 17%,

20:01.533 --> 20:04.828
then that flash across the sky,
and now this locket?

20:04.828 --> 20:08.081
- It's not that hard to believe.
- Okay. Well, then question for you.

20:08.081 --> 20:12.211
If Santa is real, how does he deliver toys
to all the world in one night?

20:12.794 --> 20:15.380
Magic, duh. Come on, Dad.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.176
Magic.

20:22.262 --> 20:25.098
Betty, something's going on
between you and Santa.

20:25.098 --> 20:27.517
The secret meetings,
the whisperings and whatnot--

20:27.517 --> 20:30.520
And don't play dumb. That's my thing.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.856
It's actually nice to see
you still get jealous.

20:32.856 --> 20:34.441
Of course I'm jealous.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.401
Santa is everything to me.

20:37.486 --> 20:40.113
Okay, can you keep a secret?

20:40.113 --> 20:42.950
No. If there's a cat,
I let it out of the bag.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.743
If there's beans, I spill them.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.495
Doc Martin says I have ASS.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.997
- Hmm?
- Acute Squawk Syndrome.

20:48.997 --> 20:53.210
Okay, I'm going to trust you on this
and certainly regret it later.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.337
Santa's thinking about retiring.

20:55.337 --> 20:58.465
Oh, holy fright!
You can't let that happen.

20:58.465 --> 20:59.800
We don't want a new Santa.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.218
That's the weird part.

21:01.218 --> 21:04.346
He wants a replacement,
but he also wants to stick around after.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.306
Maybe we can make a duplicate him.

21:06.306 --> 21:09.101
Yeah,
because that worked out so well last time.

21:09.643 --> 21:12.771
And there's more. Bernard left this.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.774
It measures Christmas spirit.

21:16.733 --> 21:18.902
When everything's great,
it shines brightly,

21:18.902 --> 21:22.239
and that's the way it's been
for all of Santa Scott's reign.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.824
But look at the middle now.

21:24.574 --> 21:27.202
It hasn't been like that
since the 14th century.

21:27.911 --> 21:32.666
The plague, famine, wars, and--

21:32.666 --> 21:34.793
Mad Santa. Yes.

21:34.793 --> 21:37.212
That's the last time
Christmas was threatened.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.047
You can't show this to Santa.

21:39.047 --> 21:41.800
It'll shatter him
like your crystal elf award.

21:41.800 --> 21:45.178
By the way, I accidentally shattered
your crystal elf award.

21:45.178 --> 21:46.680
He needs to know.

21:49.141 --> 21:52.686
I'll take care of this.
I'm more tickly than prickly.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.780
Hey! Noel, whatever it is,
it's gonna have to wait.

22:03.780 --> 22:06.366
I gotta find Sandra.
I wanna spend some quality time with her.

22:06.366 --> 22:09.828
Father of the year. Santa of the century.

22:09.828 --> 22:11.997
Is there no end to your gloriousness?

22:11.997 --> 22:13.582
May you rule forever.

22:13.582 --> 22:17.127
Oh. Betty told you
I was thinking of retiring, huh?

22:17.127 --> 22:20.255
Did she also show you
that big binder of possible replacements?

22:20.839 --> 22:22.632
I think she has one for new Noels too.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.218
Please don't retire, Santa.

22:25.218 --> 22:27.596
Don't worry. I never make a rash decision,

22:27.596 --> 22:29.848
other than putting on a dead man's coat,

22:29.848 --> 22:32.351
marrying a beautiful woman
I've only known 20 seconds,

22:32.351 --> 22:35.979
oh, and allowing a frozen lunatic
to take over the entire North Pole.

22:35.979 --> 22:37.814
Here's a reason to stay.

22:37.814 --> 22:40.901
The shinier it is,
the more Christmas spirit in the world.

22:40.901 --> 22:41.818
Oh, yeah.

22:41.818 --> 22:43.195
Ta-da!

22:43.195 --> 22:45.072
Look how bright it is!

22:45.072 --> 22:47.449
It means you're doing
the bestest job ever.

22:47.449 --> 22:50.285
- Let me see it.
- It looks best from afar.

22:50.952 --> 22:51.953
Give me the orb.

22:56.666 --> 22:58.752
A flashlight, really?

22:59.836 --> 23:02.923
I'm sorry I lied.
I just don't want you to retire.

23:02.923 --> 23:06.676
I was thinking of staying,
but this is troublesome.

23:07.260 --> 23:09.679
Here.
I'm gonna go to the Snow Globe Depository

23:09.679 --> 23:11.640
and check on Christmas spirit
around the world.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.308
Thanks for alerting me, Noel!

23:13.308 --> 23:17.437
Stupid glowy ball.
Look at all the trouble you caused!

23:20.649 --> 23:22.192
It looks like they broke something

23:22.192 --> 23:24.569
and now they're trying to
put it back together.

23:24.569 --> 23:27.697
No, I think
it's one of those jigsaw puzzles again.

23:28.198 --> 23:29.741
The real world is so complicated.

23:29.741 --> 23:30.826
Yeah.

23:31.451 --> 23:33.620
Oh, it looks like the dad
just got back from work,

23:33.620 --> 23:36.415
and he's wearing a suit that's not red.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.499
Weird.

23:37.499 --> 23:40.585
I hope he got that promotion,
so he can afford to get Lily those braces.

23:40.585 --> 23:43.588
How do you always
know so much about everyone?

23:45.257 --> 23:46.591
Oh!

23:46.591 --> 23:49.511
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, guys,
you're not supposed to be in here.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.805
- This is a restricted area.
- I know.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.181
We were just looking.

23:53.181 --> 23:55.934
Sometimes, we come in here to see
what the real world is like.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.727
I-I promise we won't do it anymore.

23:57.727 --> 24:00.230
I didn't know you cared about this. I--

24:00.230 --> 24:01.565
You love the North Pole, right?

24:01.565 --> 24:03.692
I do. I do. More than anything.

24:03.692 --> 24:07.696
I just-- I'm curious about kids.
Real kids.

24:07.696 --> 24:12.075
And Cal, I-I-I thought you just loved
your virtual fantasy world.

24:12.075 --> 24:13.410
Well...

24:13.410 --> 24:14.870
- Show him.
- Show him what?

24:15.412 --> 24:16.413
Here.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.290
What is this?

24:18.290 --> 24:20.834
Topeka, Kansas.

24:20.834 --> 24:24.421
I just finished mowing the lawn,
and now I'm going to the post office.

24:28.925 --> 24:33.513
So, all this time, you've been--
You've been playing in the normal world.

24:33.513 --> 24:37.142
Yeah. Sandra, too, sometimes.
Although she's mostly scared.

24:37.142 --> 24:38.518
Am not.

24:38.518 --> 24:41.688
Hey, kids, I mean, what--
Why didn't you just tell me this?

24:41.688 --> 24:44.524
We didn't wanna make you feel bad.

24:45.817 --> 24:47.277
Are we in trouble, Dad?

24:47.277 --> 24:49.196
Nah, you're not in trouble.

24:50.655 --> 24:52.365
I think it's me that messed up.

24:52.365 --> 24:53.909
Look, change of plans.

24:55.535 --> 24:56.786
Family meeting. Let's go.

24:59.164 --> 25:04.336
Listen, um, I've been blessed
to be Santa Claus for, what, 29 years.

25:05.045 --> 25:09.257
But also, me being Santa Claus has
required you guys to make some sacrifices

25:09.257 --> 25:11.134
that I didn't fully appreciate.

25:11.134 --> 25:13.803
It's almost like
I was looking at life through...

25:14.888 --> 25:17.766
...Santa gauze.

25:17.766 --> 25:19.184
No.

25:19.184 --> 25:23.522
Okay, and even your mom,
Mrs. Claus, feeling useless.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.565
Unappreciated. Never said useless.

25:25.565 --> 25:28.568
And you kids--
Okay, how am I gonna put this?

25:28.568 --> 25:30.820
Whatever words you're searching for,
don't say it.

25:30.820 --> 25:32.072
Right.

25:32.072 --> 25:38.245
Listen, I don't think the North Pole is
the best place to raise human children.

25:38.245 --> 25:41.998
Okay, wait. I-I love it here.

25:42.666 --> 25:44.960
I mean, is it weird? Sure.

25:44.960 --> 25:48.213
Are my braces made of sugar? Yeah.

25:48.213 --> 25:51.091
But the elf dentist insisted
that it was good for my teeth.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.425
He's not actually a dentist.

25:52.425 --> 25:56.471
He got the name Dr. Veneer because he did
all that beautiful woodwork on my sleigh.

25:56.471 --> 25:59.349
- We gave him that name because--
- Is there a point to all this, Scott?

25:59.349 --> 26:01.768
Yes, there is a point. The point is--

26:03.353 --> 26:05.939
Okay. I could do this forever,

26:07.274 --> 26:08.942
but for the good of Christmas,

26:09.568 --> 26:11.570
for the good of my family,

26:13.029 --> 26:15.282
I think we make some changes.

26:15.282 --> 26:19.911
See what the rest of the world's like
as-- as normal people.

26:20.829 --> 26:23.123
So, I'm retiring.

26:23.873 --> 26:26.585
- Wait, so this is really real?
- What?

26:26.585 --> 26:27.794
This is really real.

26:27.794 --> 26:30.463
I've been a little bit alarmed
at my loss in magic.

26:30.463 --> 26:33.216
I mean, earlier I sneezed,
the lights went out.

26:33.967 --> 26:37.262
But this is the real magic.

26:37.262 --> 26:38.930
The family, right here.

26:43.476 --> 26:45.353
Is that tree crying?

26:45.353 --> 26:47.731
No. Why?

26:48.231 --> 26:49.858
Take me instead.

26:49.858 --> 26:52.319
Noel, come on out. There we go.

26:52.319 --> 26:56.656
I'll be fine.
Just pretend that I'm not here.

26:56.656 --> 26:58.617
We know how Noel feels about this.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.952
What do you guys think? What do you feel?

27:00.952 --> 27:03.204
I mean, if you're in, I'm in.

27:04.623 --> 27:08.835
I guess I can learn to, uh...
uh, uh, people.

27:08.835 --> 27:11.338
Well,
every journey begins with a first step,

27:11.338 --> 27:13.798
and I'm ready to take mine.

27:13.798 --> 27:15.967
- Wait, wait. Honey, I don't...
- No.

27:15.967 --> 27:18.345
- Incoming! Guys, everybody down!
- No, no, no, wait!

27:27.562 --> 27:30.523
That feels so good.

27:31.358 --> 27:33.777
- Well, I'm glad you feel good, honey.
- Me too!

27:35.862 --> 27:36.696
Oh.

27:44.496 --> 27:45.538
What is this about?

27:45.538 --> 27:49.042
And what happened to Mrs. Claus?
Are we here to shame her?

27:49.042 --> 27:52.379
Attention, everyone!
Santa has an announcement to make.

27:56.132 --> 27:58.134
I don't think I can go through with this.

27:59.052 --> 28:01.638
Never mind, everyone!
Santa has nothing to say to you.

28:01.638 --> 28:04.099
Well, don't say it like that.
It sounds like I don't care.

28:04.099 --> 28:06.351
Attention, everyone!
Santa does have something to say.

28:06.351 --> 28:08.812
- Okay, let's stop this. Let's stop.
- Okay, okay.

28:08.812 --> 28:11.439
Did you change your mind?
'Cause I can't go back to the bun.

28:11.981 --> 28:13.775
You know what scares me most
about leaving?

28:13.775 --> 28:15.276
- Having to pay for waffles.
- Yes.

28:15.276 --> 28:16.486
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

28:16.486 --> 28:19.447
When I first arrived here,
the elves were so happy.

28:19.447 --> 28:20.532
Oh, that's nice.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.200
Yeah, one would think.

28:22.200 --> 28:25.578
But they didn't seem to care
about the previous Santa disappearing.

28:26.287 --> 28:28.581
- They didn't even shed a tear.
- Hmm.

28:28.581 --> 28:31.668
And if they do that for me,
it'd be like I didn't matter.

28:31.668 --> 28:34.295
One thing no one can say
about Scott Calvin,

28:34.295 --> 28:37.465
and there's a lot,
is that he never mattered.

28:39.759 --> 28:40.969
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.972
Okay, I do have an announcement to make.

28:44.514 --> 28:46.599
Betty already said that.

28:46.599 --> 28:47.684
Who's talking?

28:47.684 --> 28:51.271
Sorry, that was me.
Sometimes I think out loud.

28:51.271 --> 28:52.355
Okay.

28:52.355 --> 28:54.983
I'm sure a lot of you noticed
I haven't been myself lately, right?

28:54.983 --> 28:59.070
Well, after careful consideration
and a talk with my family,

28:59.070 --> 29:04.033
I, Santa Claus, have decided to retire.

29:13.293 --> 29:14.461
That's okay.

29:23.970 --> 29:25.096
Why?

29:25.096 --> 29:27.098
I matter. Yes!

29:27.599 --> 29:29.225
We have a grief counselor, right?

29:29.225 --> 29:31.060
Kleenex, on me!

29:31.644 --> 29:32.854
- Good job.
- Hmm.

29:33.772 --> 29:34.981
So, what now?

29:35.648 --> 29:39.027
Guess we should hide all the hard cider
and sharp tools, huh?

29:39.027 --> 29:42.405
- Well, they seem devastated.
- I know.

29:42.405 --> 29:44.657
So, we start bringing in candidates?

29:55.877 --> 29:57.128
Dad.

29:58.338 --> 29:59.798
What were you looking at?

30:01.216 --> 30:02.425
Uh...

30:04.093 --> 30:06.930
You googled
"does Santa Claus really exist?"

30:06.930 --> 30:08.306
You believe.

30:08.306 --> 30:10.141
I don't know what I believe, honey.

30:10.141 --> 30:14.562
I mean, this guy says that Santa is real
and a founding member of the Illuminati.

30:14.562 --> 30:17.774
And then you've got a lot of conversation
about how it's possible

30:17.774 --> 30:21.736
that Santa can deliver all these presents
to the whole world all in one night.

30:21.736 --> 30:24.072
And then, here, look. A video of Santa.

30:24.072 --> 30:26.741
This guy has a theory
that Santa uses vortexes.

30:26.741 --> 30:29.494
That there are holes in the sky
that no one else can see.

30:30.119 --> 30:31.120
Convenient.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.455
I know it's all crazy.

30:32.455 --> 30:34.582
I was just looking for ideas, like,

30:34.582 --> 30:39.003
if it were all real, and I could somehow
recreate Santa's delivery system...

30:39.003 --> 30:41.089
You got your crazy eyes again, Dad.

30:41.089 --> 30:44.676
Yeah, he does have crazy eyes.

30:45.885 --> 30:47.095
To the safe room!

30:47.095 --> 30:48.972
Don't be afraid of the scary intruder.

30:48.972 --> 30:50.807
I think that was just a little girl.

30:54.310 --> 30:56.729
- This is a fun game.
- How'd you do that?

30:56.729 --> 30:58.898
Simon Choksi,
you've been summoned to the North Pole.

30:58.898 --> 31:01.067
First of all, I don't go anywhere
without my daughter.

31:01.067 --> 31:02.485
And second of all--
