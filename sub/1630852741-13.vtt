WEBVTT

00:01.827 --> 00:05.896
PREVIOUSLY ON CELEBRITY
BIG BROTHER"!

00:05.931 --> 00:11.620
THE TODD FATHER TOOK POWER.
TODD, YOU ARE THE NEW HOH!

00:11.655 --> 00:15.068
YES!
I AM THE HOH, BABY.

00:15.103 --> 00:17.172
AND HE WAS GUNNING FOR CARSON.

00:17.206 --> 00:20.241
I HAVE NOMINATED, YOU CARSON,
AND YOU, LAMAR.

00:20.275 --> 00:24.172
I NOMINATED CARSON BECAUSE HE
IS REALLY GOOD AND REALLY

00:24.206 --> 00:26.896
WELL-LIKED, IF I CAN GET CARSON
OUT OF HERE THAT JUST MAKES MY

00:26.931 --> 00:29.034
CHANCES OF WINNING EVEN HIGHER.
LET'S WIN.

00:29.068 --> 00:33.827
WITH TODD FINALLY POSING A
THREAT, HE LANDED ON THE POWER

00:33.862 --> 00:38.137
DUO'S RADAR.
I THINK I HAVE TO GET CARSON

00:38.172 --> 00:44.172
THIS WEEK --
AFTER THE MMA MASTERS SCORED

00:44.206 --> 00:47.137
THE VETO.
OH, LOOK AT THAT.

00:47.172 --> 00:51.310
OH, MY GOSH, YOU SEE THAT?
SHE LEFT TODD'S NOMINATIONS

00:51.344 --> 00:54.724
IN PLACE.
I HAVE DECIDED NOT TO USE THE

00:54.758 --> 01:00.000
POWER OF VETO.
CARTON TRIED TO STRIKE A DEAL

01:00.034 --> 01:05.000
TO SAVE HIS GAME.
YOU VOTE TO KEEP ME HERE AND

01:05.034 --> 01:06.068
THAT WOULD BE AMAZING. YEAH.

01:06.103 --> 01:09.758
AND WE WOULD DEFINITELY
GUARANTEE YOU OUR VOTES.

01:09.793 --> 01:12.689
AND TODRICK CONSIDERED THE OFFER.

01:12.724 --> 01:16.620
I COULD DEFINITELY USE TWO
JURY VOTES AT THE END OF THIS

01:16.655 --> 01:17.965
GAME.
DO YOU THINK THERE IS EVEN A

01:18.000 --> 01:19.862
WORLD WHERE WE SHOULD CONSIDER
THIS?

01:19.896 --> 01:24.068
BUT AT THE LIVE EVICTION --
I VOTE TO HE STRICT THE

01:24.103 --> 01:26.862
LOVELY CARSON.
CARSON, I VOTE TO EVICT YOU,

01:26.896 --> 01:31.103
YOU LOVELY, FABULOUS HUMAN.
THE ORIGINAL PLAN STAYED

01:31.137 --> 01:34.103
INTACT.
BY A VOTE OF 2-1, CARSON, YOU

01:34.137 --> 01:37.206
ARE EVICTED FROM THE BIG BROTHER HOUSE.

01:37.241 --> 01:44.655

02:51.517 --> 02:54.655

02:54.689 --> 02:56.862
AMEN.
I AM GUNNING FOR YOU.

02:56.896 --> 03:01.482
BRING IT ON.
I AM JUST STARTING MY STRIDE.

03:01.517 --> 03:07.551
I OUTLASTED A NUMBER OF THESE
CONTESTANTS, I WIGGLED AND MOVED

03:07.586 --> 03:12.206
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT ANDED TO
IS, TODD IS STILL HERE.

03:12.241 --> 03:16.413
CARSON IS GONE THAT IS GOOD
FOR ME BECAUSE I GOT A HUGE STEP

03:16.448 --> 03:21.172
IN THE HOUSE AND THAT'S ONE MORE
STEP FOR ME TO WIN "CELEBRITY

03:21.206 --> 03:23.034
BIG BROTHER".
ARE YOU SURE YOU ARE MAKING

03:23.068 --> 03:28.172
- US OUT OF THE 23
- RD? MAKING IT TO THE FINAL 5 IS

03:28.206 --> 03:32.310
AN ACHIEVEMENT IN ITSELF.
I GOT TO A FEW PLACES WHERE I

03:32.344 --> 03:35.517
ALMOST BROKE DOWN N BASKETBALL
TERMS RIGHT NOW I HAVEN'T SHOT

03:35.551 --> 03:39.379
YET BUT I WILL KEEP SHOOTING
UNTIL MY CLIP IS EMPTY.

03:39.413 --> 03:42.379
DON'T LET ME WIN HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.

03:42.413 --> 03:45.103
NOW THAT CARSON IS OUT OF THE
HOUSE, MY GAME FACE IS ALL THE

03:45.137 --> 03:47.275
WAY ON.
IT IS TIME FOR ME TO GET SOME

03:47.310 --> 03:50.275
POWER IN THIS HOUSE.
I HAVE TO START WINNING FOR MY

03:50.310 --> 03:53.000
BIG BROTHER RESUME AND START
WINNING NOW.

03:53.034 --> 03:55.172
HOW ARE YOU FEELING, BABE?
NO GOOD.

03:55.206 --> 03:58.344
KEEP CHECKING OR --
I APPRECIATE THAT, THANK YOU.

03:58.379 --> 04:02.793
CARSON AND I TRIED TO MAKE A
DEAL WITH MIESHA AND TODRICK IT

04:02.827 --> 04:06.344
IS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING
BECAUSE WE SAVED MIESHA AND IT

04:06.379 --> 04:08.862
KIND OF, THEY DIDN'T KIND OF
RETURN THE FAVOR WHEN WE NEEDED

04:08.896 --> 04:11.413
IT.
WHAT WHAT DID YOU GUYS

04:11.448 --> 04:12.655
DECIDE?
WE NEED TO KNOW.

04:12.689 --> 04:17.793
WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT IT.
THANKS FOR HEATING THIS UP.

04:17.827 --> 04:22.172
IT IS TIME TO GO HOME.
TIME TO GO HOME, DUDE.

04:22.206 --> 04:25.413
THE DRAMA IS KILLING ME.
TOO MUCH.

04:25.448 --> 04:26.586
WHISPER BEHIND BACKS, THAT KILLS ME.

04:26.620 --> 04:28.241
I AM SURE YOU ARE NEXT ON THE LIST.

04:28.275 --> 04:30.103
I ALREADY KNOW, BUT YOU KNOW
SOMETHING?

04:30.137 --> 04:33.551
I AIN'T GOING TO CARE.
DID YOU GET AN ANSWER?

04:33.586 --> 04:37.965
NO.
I ASKED TODRICK, LIKE WE JUST

04:38.000 --> 04:39.344
DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO TALK
ABOUT IT YET.

04:39.379 --> 04:42.689
OKAY.
THAT IS ACTUALLY SHADY.

04:42.724 --> 04:47.931
CARSON, I JUST WANT TO LET
YOU KNOW, WE ARE GOING TO GIVE

04:47.965 --> 04:50.034
YOU THE CHOP, WE ARE GOING TO
GIVE YOU THE CHOP.

04:50.068 --> 04:51.310
OKAY.
IT IS ALL GOOD.

04:51.344 --> 04:55.344
THANKS FOR LETTING US KNOW. OKAY.

04:55.379 --> 04:57.793
YEAH.

04:57.827 --> 05:04.034
I AM JUST GOING TO --
I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY

05:04.068 --> 05:12.206
WISE, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THE
OTHERS -- ARE SUPER TRUSTWORTHY.

05:12.241 --> 05:18.172
THAT SPOKE VOLUMES ABOUT
HOW MUCH THEY JUST WANT TO WIN.

05:18.206 --> 05:20.482
YEAH.
THEY WILL DO ANYTHING.

05:20.517 --> 05:25.310
NOW THAT I KNOW CAR SON IS
WALKING OUT THE DOOR, I HAVE TO

05:25.344 --> 05:28.034
GET SOME NUMBERS TO GO AGAINST
TODRICK AND MIESHA.

05:28.068 --> 05:30.827
PLEASE TRY AND WIN AT THIS
PLAN, SERIOUSLY.

05:30.862 --> 05:33.448
I WOULD BE SO EXCITED FOR THAT.

05:33.482 --> 05:36.482
WELL, I AM THINKING THEY ARE
GOING TO VOTE FOR ME --

05:36.517 --> 05:41.034
THEY ARE, BUT IT IS BETTER
THE THREE OF YOU THAT ONE OF

05:41.068 --> 05:46.379
YOU, THAN ONE OF YOU, YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO LOSE.

05:46.413 --> 05:49.724
NOT GOING ANYWHERE, RIGHT?

05:49.758 --> 06:09.034
WE HAVE A --

06:09.068 --> 06:11.379
LOOK AT THAT, MAN.
THAT'S A NICE JACKET, DUDE.

06:11.413 --> 06:15.344
THANK YOU.
YOU KNOW, IT IS NOT EVERY DAY

06:15.379 --> 06:21.724
YOU GET A BIG DA --
THAT LAUGH WAS SO FAKE,

06:21.758 --> 06:22.724
TODRICK.
WHAT?

06:22.758 --> 06:25.034
HA, HA, HA.
IT WAS FUNNY, IT WAS FUNNY TO

06:25.068 --> 06:26.379
ME.
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IS

06:26.413 --> 06:28.034
GOING ON WITH LAMAR AND HIS ENERGY.

06:28.068 --> 06:33.620
IT IS LIKE WHERE IS THIS EVEN
COMING FROM, THAT HE HAS

06:33.655 --> 06:37.103
ANYPLACE TO TALK ABOUT ANYBODY
BEING RUDE, IT IS COMPLETELY

06:37.137 --> 06:39.137
FRUSTRATING IF I AM BEING
COMPLETELY HONEST.

06:39.172 --> 06:42.689
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
I LOVE YOU AND --

06:42.724 --> 06:46.103
I LOVE YOU TOO, BRO.
I JUST FEEL LIKE OUR ENERGY

06:46.137 --> 06:48.620
HAS BEEN WEIRD, I HAVEN'T SAID
ANYTHING TO YOU AND I CAME OUT

06:48.655 --> 06:51.206
HERE AND THE LAUGH IS FAKE, TODRICK.

06:51.241 --> 06:53.931
I LOVE YOU.
IT IS OWNING AND POPPING.

06:53.965 --> 06:58.965
OH, MAN.
I AM READY TO GO HOME.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.724
YOU AIN'T GOING ANYWHERE, IT
IS YOU AND MIESHA, YOU ARE THE

07:02.758 --> 07:05.793
LAST TWO BUT IT IS GOING TO BE
THE VOTE THAT WILL HAVE TO DO

07:05.827 --> 07:07.172
IT, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GET THE VOTE.

07:07.206 --> 07:12.103
THAT'S FINE.
AND UNLESS THERE IS A

07:12.137 --> 07:14.965
SURPRISEÑç CHANGE, UNLESS SOMEBY
ELSE WINS AN HOH, YOU COULD BE

07:15.000 --> 07:21.275
IN TROUBLE.
THANK YOU, TODD, I THINK IT

07:21.310 --> 07:24.793
IS A LITTLE PREMATURE FOR THESE
PREDICTIONS, TODD, AND I WOULD

07:24.827 --> 07:27.068
REALLY LIKE FOR YOU TO KEEP YOUR
NEGATIVE ENERGY OVER THERE

07:27.103 --> 07:29.482
BECAUSE I HAVE A GAME TO STILL
TRY TO WIN TONIGHT.

07:29.517 --> 07:34.310
TODD JUST CAME TO ME AND IT
IS LIKE GOING TO BE YOU AND

07:34.344 --> 07:37.344
MIESHA IN THE END UNLESS
SOMETHING CRAZY HAPPENS, BUT TO

07:37.379 --> 07:41.000
GETS THE VOTES -- IT IS LIKE,
OKAY, LIKE WHAT?

07:41.034 --> 07:44.724
WHY ARE YOU SAYING THIS TO ME?
YOU KNOW, IT IS JUST LIKE SUCH A

07:44.758 --> 07:46.758
WEIRD CONVERSATION. YEAH.

07:46.793 --> 07:50.241
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THIS
HOUSE?

07:50.275 --> 07:53.034
PEOPLE ARE JUST TRYING TO GET
ON THEIR HIGH HORSES.

07:53.068 --> 07:56.172
BUT WHY WITH ME?
I DIDN'T SAY IT TO --

07:56.206 --> 07:58.965
I FEEL LIKE THEY ARE SCARED
OF ME.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.379
IS THAT WEIRD?
MAYBE.

08:00.413 --> 08:04.482
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, BUT I
JUST THINK IT IS SO WEIRD, LIKE

08:04.517 --> 08:07.655
EVERYBODY HAS BEEN WHISPERING
THIS WHOLE TIME WE HAVE BEEN

08:07.689 --> 08:11.482
HERE.
EVERYBODY IS HAVING PRIVATE

08:11.517 --> 08:14.862
CONVERSATIONS.
IT IS JUST RUDE.

08:14.896 --> 08:19.068
IS IT RUDE?
WHATEVER.

08:19.103 --> 08:24.724
I AM JUST SO OVER IT.
WE ARE ALMOST THERE.

08:24.758 --> 08:41.034
SO I DON'T KNOW -- I JUST
WANTED TO REASSURE --

08:41.068 --> 08:44.758
THAT IS MESSED UP.
LAMAR AND ME HAVE BEEN

08:44.793 --> 08:47.034
WORKING WITH MIESHA AND TODRICK
THROUGHOUT THE GAME AND NOW

08:47.068 --> 08:50.413
THERE ARE FIVE OF US THEY WILL
TRY TO STEAM ROLL US NOW THAT

08:50.448 --> 08:52.793
MEANS WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE THREE

08:52.827 --> 08:54.586
OF US ARE ON THE SAME PAGE.
WE ARE.

08:54.620 --> 08:58.379
WITH THE HOH.
GOT TO WIN IT, ALL I CAN DO

08:58.413 --> 09:03.275
IS WATCH.
IT SUCKS, BUT IF YOU WIN IT YOU

09:03.310 --> 09:04.862
GOT THE VOTE.
I AM VOTING.

09:04.896 --> 09:09.655
LAMAR, IF YOU WIN IT --
I WILL BE OUT OF HERE.

09:09.689 --> 09:11.896
YEP.
I AM TRYING TO BE STRONG.

09:11.931 --> 09:16.586
THE PLAN WOULD BE TO GO AFTER
A MIESHA AND TODRICK COMBO, IF

09:16.620 --> 09:18.896
YOU ARE NOT TEAMED UP WITH THE
STRONG NEST THE GAME, THEN YOU

09:18.931 --> 09:22.068
HAVE TO TRY TO BEAT THEM BY ANY
MEANS HE IS.

09:22.103 --> 09:25.586
YOU HAVE TO CUT THE HEAD OFF
THE SNAKE.

09:25.620 --> 09:30.724
IT IS US OR THEM, IT IS JUST
GOING TO BE SO WEIRD WITHOUT

09:30.758 --> 09:33.551
CARSON IN THIS HOUSE.
SO I REALLY WANT TO TRY TO

09:33.586 --> 09:38.000
WIN SOMETHING NOW AND HAVE A
LITTLE DIGNITY AT THIS POINT, AS

09:38.034 --> 09:42.241
MUCH AS I MISS CARSON, IT IS
TIME TO MOVE FORWARD AND THE

09:42.275 --> 09:46.103
BATTLE LINES HAVE BEEN DRAWN.
IT IS TODRICK AND MIESHA

09:46.137 --> 09:50.172
VERSUS ME, TODD AND LAMAR.
I HOPE YOU WIN.

09:50.206 --> 09:51.862
TODAY WILL BE YOUR DAY.
I WANT TO.

09:51.896 --> 09:56.206
I REALLY DO. YEAH.

09:56.241 --> 10:01.413
HEY, EVERYBODY, IT IS TIME
FOR THE HOH COMPETITION, GET

10:01.448 --> 10:04.620
READY AND BIG BROTHER TELLS YOU
IT IS TIME TO COMPETE.

10:04.655 --> 10:11.034
ALL RIGHT!

10:11.068 --> 10:15.206
OH.
OH, MY GOODNESS.

10:15.241 --> 10:17.000
WOW.
WHAT?

10:17.034 --> 10:20.793
THE BB ART MUSEUM JUST
RECEIVED A SHIPMENT OF PRICE

10:20.827 --> 10:25.551
LESS MODERN ARTWORK, BUT SOMEONE
HAS MIXED IN A FEW FORGERIES.

10:25.586 --> 10:29.586
IN THIS WEEK'S HOH COMPETITION,
IT IS UP TO YOU TO FIND THESE

10:29.620 --> 10:36.137
FAKES AND KEEP THEM, THE MUSEUM
'S UNFLAWED REPUTATION

10:36.172 --> 10:38.034
INTACT.
SINCE I AM HOH I AM NOT ELIGIBLE

10:38.068 --> 10:41.000
TO COMPETE.
HERE IS HOW IT WORKS, THROUGHOUT

10:41.034 --> 10:45.517
THE HOUSE ARE SIX PIECES OF BB
ORIGINAL MODERN ART, YOUR JOB IS

10:45.551 --> 10:48.586
TO RACE THROUGH HOUSE AND TO
COMPARE THE MEMORY WALL ART TO

10:48.620 --> 10:50.827
THE ORIGINAL PIECES INSIDE THE HOUSE.

10:50.862 --> 10:54.620
ONE PIECE OF AFFIRMATIVE ONTHE
MEMORY WALL WILL ALWAYS BE A

10:54.655 --> 10:57.448
FORGERY.
ONCE YOU FIGURE OUT WHICH

10:57.482 --> 11:00.689
PAINTING DOESN'T MATCH, RUSH
BACK HERE AND PLACE THE NUMBER

11:00.724 --> 11:03.241
OF THE FAKE ARTWORK IN YOUR PODIUM.

11:03.275 --> 11:07.137
IN EACH ROUND THE FIRST NICE
ANSWER INCORRECTLY IS

11:07.172 --> 11:08.517
ELIMINATED.
BUT IF EVERYONE ANSWERS

11:08.551 --> 11:11.758
CORRECTLY THEN THE LAST HOUSE
GUEST TO ANSWER IS OUT.

11:11.793 --> 11:16.862
THE LAST PLAYER REMAINING
WILL BE CROWNED THE NEXT HEAD OF

11:16.896 --> 11:19.448
HOUSEHOLD.
ARE YOU READY TO PLAY SPOT THE

11:19.482 --> 11:22.241
FAKE?

11:22.275 --> 11:27.655
IT IS DOWN TO THE FINAL 5, SO
THIS WEEK IF YOU ARE NOT HOH,

11:27.689 --> 11:29.931
THERE IS A 5050 CHANCE YOU ARE
ON THE BLOCK.

11:29.965 --> 11:34.000
I CAN'T TRUST ANYONE IN THIS
HOUSE EXCEPT FOR TODRICK, SO IT

11:34.034 --> 11:37.586
IS IMPERATIVE THAT ONE OF US
WINS THIS HOH SO WE CAN TARGET

11:37.620 --> 11:40.827
TO TODD AND GET HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE.

11:40.862 --> 11:43.068
THE STAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.862
I REALLY WANT TO PUT UP
TODRICK AND MIESHA, THEY HAVE

11:45.896 --> 11:49.137
BEEN A DUO SINCE THE BEGINNING
AND IT IS TIME FOR ME TO PUT AN

11:49.172 --> 11:52.172
END TO THAT.
IF TODRICK OR MIESHA WINS

11:52.206 --> 11:57.413
THIS COMPETITION, ME, TODD, AND
LAMAR WILL BE IN BIG TROUBLE.

11:57.448 --> 12:01.862
IT IS PRETTY MUCH US AGAINST
THEM AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE

12:01.896 --> 12:06.586
THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN.
IF I WANT THE JURY TO RESPECT

12:06.620 --> 12:10.413
ME, I AM NEEDING TO MAKE SOME
MAJOR MOVES AND THAT STARTS WITH

12:10.448 --> 12:13.862
ME WINNING HOH AND ENDS WITH ME
PUTTING TODD ON THE BLOCK, SHE A

12:13.896 --> 12:16.931
HUGE THREAT AND IF WE CAN GET
ONE OF THE HUGE THREATS OUT OF

12:16.965 --> 12:19.068
HERE I THINK THAT WOULD BE
EXTRAORDINARY FOR MY BIG BROTHER

12:19.103 --> 12:19.551
RESUME.

12:33.551 --> 12:36.241
FIRST ROUND OF ART IS READY FOR INSPECTION.

12:36.275 --> 12:41.310
HEAD INSIDE AND SPOT THE FAKE.

12:41.344 --> 12:46.931
THIS COMPETITION IS CRAZY.

12:46.965 --> 12:49.482
WE HAVE TO RACE THROUGH THE BIG
BROTHER HOUSE LOOKING AT

12:49.517 --> 12:53.586
DIFFERENT PIECES OF ART THAT ARE
ALSO DISPLAYED ON THE MEMORY

12:53.620 --> 12:56.310
WALL.
EACH ROUND, THE LAST PERSON TO

12:56.344 --> 12:59.793
IDENTIFY THE FORGERY OR THE
FIRST PERSON TO ANSWER

12:59.827 --> 13:03.551
INCORRECTLY IS ELIMINATED.
AFTER THREE ROUNDS, THE FINAL

13:03.586 --> 13:11.931
PERSON STANDING IS THE NEW HEAD
OF HOUSEHOLD.

13:11.965 --> 13:16.068
THE FIRST PAINTING I DECIDE

13:16.103 --> 13:22.344
TO CHECK OUT IS THE MULTICOLORED
CAMERA PAINTING.

13:22.379 --> 13:25.931
I AM TRYING TO SPOT THE
DIFFERENCES BUT THIS ONE LOOKS

13:25.965 --> 13:29.068
IDENTICAL TO THE ONE ON THE
MEMORY WALL, SO THAT ONE CAN'T

13:29.103 --> 13:37.068
BE THE ANSWER.
MY STRATEGY IS TO TAKE A LOOK

13:37.103 --> 13:40.793
AT THE MEMORY WALL AND THEN JUST
HOPE THAT SOMETHING POPS OUT TO

13:40.827 --> 13:42.931
ME WHN I GO INTO EACH AND EVERY
ONE OF THE ROOMS.

13:42.965 --> 13:48.724
I DECIDE TO RUN TO THE BACK OF
THE HOUSE AND I SEE MONA LISA

13:48.758 --> 13:52.620
WITH HER HOH ROBE BUT I
IMMEDIATELY NOTICE THE HOH IS A

13:52.655 --> 13:55.758
DIFFERENT COLOR.
HAD I ALREADY CRACKED THE CODE

13:55.793 --> 13:58.068
AROUND ONE?
I IMMEDIATELY RUN OUTSIDE, LOCK

13:58.103 --> 14:02.241
IN MY ANSWER, BECAUSE I AM
HOPING THAT MS. MONA LISA AIN'T

14:02.275 --> 14:05.448
PLAYING TRICKS ON ME AND I CAN
MAKE IT TO THE NEXT ROUND.

14:05.482 --> 14:10.000
I RUN INTO THE LIVING ROOM
AND A PICTURE OF CARSON'S CAKE,

14:10.034 --> 14:13.689
A COUPLE OF APPLES AND A
PICTURE, PITCHER OF WINE CATCH

14:13.724 --> 14:16.068
MY EYE.
SOMETHING ISN'T QUITE RIGHT

14:16.103 --> 14:18.482
ABOUT THIS PICTURE.
I JUST CAN'T PUT MY FINGER ON

14:18.517 --> 14:26.275
IT, SO I AM GOING TO KEEP IT
MOVING AND COME BACK TO IT.

14:26.310 --> 14:30.517
I TAKE A LOOK AT THE MONA
LISA I SPOT THE DIFFERENCE.

14:30.551 --> 14:34.034
I AM FEELING VERY CONFIDENT
ABOUT THIS ANSWER.

14:34.068 --> 14:40.068
THE MONA LISA IN THE HOH ROBE IS
THE MOST RELAXED PICTURE OF THE

14:40.103 --> 14:43.103
MONA LISA I HAVE EVER SEEN.
SHE LOOKS VERY COMFORTABLE.

14:43.137 --> 14:48.137
BUT EXCUSE ME, MONA LISA, I WILL
NEED THE ROBE BACK AFTER THE

14:48.172 --> 14:50.482
COMPETITION.
I JUST WANT TO TAKE MY TIME

14:50.517 --> 14:54.586
IN THIS GAME, RIGHT?
AT LEAST DO SOMETHING RIGHT.

14:54.620 --> 14:57.620
TAKE ONE SHOT AND MAKE A LAY-UP.
IF IT FEELS ALL RIGHT, IF YOU

14:57.655 --> 15:02.206
LIKE ART, I THINK I MIGHT
ACTUALLY TAKE THE CAMERA

15:02.241 --> 15:07.172
PAINTING HOME, I THINK IT WOULD
BE A GOOD PAINTING TO HAVE MY

15:07.206 --> 15:08.965
HOME.
BUT HOW DO YOU PICK WHICH ONE IS

15:09.000 --> 15:11.448
OKAY.
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD FIT IN

15:11.482 --> 15:16.034
MY LUGGAGE RIGHT NOW. OKAY.

15:16.068 --> 15:20.758
THE CORRECT ANSWER IS NUMBER
4 THE HOH LOGO IS A DIFFERENT

15:20.793 --> 15:22.551
COLOR.
SORRY, CYNTHIA, YOU ANSWERED

15:22.586 --> 15:28.517
INCORRECTLY AND YOU ARE
ELIMINATED FROM THE COMPETITION.

15:28.551 --> 15:32.758
I REALLY NEEDED TO WIN THE
HOH, JUST TO FEEL GOOD AT THIS

15:32.793 --> 15:38.758
POINT AND I REALLY FELT LIKE I
HAD A REAL SHOT, AND I BASICALLY

15:38.793 --> 15:43.344
WAS ELIMINATED FIRST.
THIS IS NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR ME.

15:43.379 --> 15:47.620
OH, CYNTHIA, I THOUGHT YOU
HAD IT.

15:47.655 --> 15:51.241
I AM AN OUTGOING HOH SO I CAN'T
PLAY IN A GAME I KNOW I WOULD

15:51.275 --> 15:54.103
HAVE WON.
NOW WE HAVE TO COUNT ON LAMAR.

15:54.137 --> 15:58.206
COCOME ON, LAMAR, IT IS FOURTH
QUARTER, MAN, HIT THAT JUMP

15:58.241 --> 15:59.517
SHOT!
THE ART ON THE MEMORY WALL

15:59.551 --> 16:04.172
HAS BEEN RESET.
THERE IS A NEW FAKE.

16:09.206 --> 16:14.620
I LOOK AT THE MEMORY WALL AND
THE CAMERA PAINTING IMMEDIATELY

16:14.655 --> 16:17.310
STANDS OUT.
I AM LOOKING EVERYWHERE.

16:17.344 --> 16:22.379
I AM OBSERVING EACH PAINTING.
THIS COMPETITION IS SO HARD,

16:22.413 --> 16:26.551
BECAUSE THIS HOUSE IS NOT SUPER,
SUPER SMALL, AND EVERY SINGLE

16:26.586 --> 16:33.896
SECOND COUNTS.

16:33.931 --> 16:37.862
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON THIS
PAINTING IN ROUND 1, I JUST WANT

16:37.896 --> 16:39.724
TO DOUBLE-CHECK ONE THING JUST
TO MAKE SURE.

16:39.758 --> 16:42.448
THERE IS NO ROOM FOR MISTAKES HERE.

16:42.482 --> 16:46.034
I AM RUNNING THROUGH THE
HOUSE AND THESE PAINTINGS ARE

16:46.068 --> 16:51.241
ALL STARTING TO LOOK THE SAME.
ALL OF A SUDDEN IT CLICKS.

16:51.275 --> 16:57.206
AND THEN IT HIT ME.
I AM PRETTY SURE I GOT THIS

16:57.241 --> 16:57.586
ONE.

17:23.862 --> 17:30.482
THE CORRECT ANSWER IS 3.
ONE OF THE CAMERAS IS BACKWARDS.

17:30.517 --> 17:35.448
LAMAR, YOU WERE THE LAST TO
LOCK IN, SO YOU HAVE BEEN

17:35.482 --> 17:37.137
ELIMINATED.
DAMN.

17:37.172 --> 17:40.620
DAMN, DAMN, DAMN, DAMN.
I LOST.

17:40.655 --> 17:45.379
LAMAR, PLEASE TAKE A SEAT.
I WENT TO IT RIGHT IN THE

17:45.413 --> 17:48.482
BEGINNING TOO, RIGHT AT IT.
MY PROBLEM WAS I WAS

17:48.517 --> 17:55.448
SECOND-GUESSING MYSELF.
IT WAS IN MY GUT BUT I DIDN'T,

17:55.482 --> 17:58.586
THAT'S WHY I CAME UP SHORT, SO I
WILL JUST HAVE TO LIVE WITH

17:58.620 --> 18:03.310
THAT.
LAMAR SHOOTS AND EHH, WE LOST

18:03.344 --> 18:05.724
LAMAR, THANKS.
WE WERE JUST TALKING TO CYNTHIA

18:05.758 --> 18:09.620
AND LAMAR ABOUT WINNING THE COMP
AND NOW WE DIDN'T WIN IT SO NOW

18:09.655 --> 18:12.586
WE HAVE GOT SIT HERE AND JUST BE
WONDERING WHO IS GOING TO BE

18:12.620 --> 18:15.310
NEXT TO GO HOME.
WE COULD HAVE CONTROLLED IT, BUT

18:15.344 --> 18:20.620
NOW WE DON'T.
THIS IS THE FINAL ROUND AND

18:20.655 --> 18:24.862
YOUR LAST CHANCE TO SPOT A FAKE
AND WIN HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.

18:24.896 --> 18:27.655
IT IS DOWN TO TODRICK AND I
AND ALTHOUGH I AM COMFORTABLE

18:27.689 --> 18:32.103
WITH EITHER ONE OF US WINNING, I
STILL LIKE TO WIN AND PERSONALLY

18:32.137 --> 18:36.758
I AM GING FOR A RECORD HERE.
I TRUST TODRICK IMPLICITLY, BUT

18:36.793 --> 18:39.965
THIS IS BIG BROTHER AND OF
COURSE THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN

18:40.000 --> 18:44.551
ENSURE YOUR SAFETY IS TO WIN HOH.

18:44.586 --> 18:47.103
THIS IS MORE NERVE-RACKING
THAN IT SEEMS.

18:47.137 --> 18:49.655
MIESHA ALREADY HAS AN IMPRESSIVE
RESUME AND I DON'T WANT TO BE

18:49.689 --> 18:52.482
THE PERSON THAT WAS ALWAYS
GETTING PULLED THROUGH THE

18:52.517 --> 18:54.793
COMPETITION BY HER.
I DIDN'T COME HERE TO BE THE

18:54.827 --> 18:58.241
SIDEKICK TO SOMEONE ELSE.
I CAME HERE TO WIN THIS

18:58.275 --> 18:59.310
COMPETITION.
THE ART ON THE MEMORY WALL

18:59.344 --> 19:05.517
HAS BEEN RESET.
THERE IS A NEW FAKE.

19:10.482 --> 19:13.517
IT IS DOWN TO TODRICK AND I,
THE FIRST ONE TO SPOT THE FAKE

19:13.551 --> 19:17.103
PIECE OF ARTWORK AND ANSWER
CORRECTLY OUT IN THE BACKYARD

19:17.137 --> 19:22.655
WILL BE THE NEW HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.

19:22.689 --> 19:28.827
I HAVE INTIEWN THE FRONT

19:28.862 --> 19:31.413
BEDROOM AND LOOKING AT THE
PAINTING WITH THE KEYS AND I AM

19:31.448 --> 19:34.965
TRYING TO DECIPHER, IS IT THE
COLOR OF THE KEYS?

19:35.000 --> 19:37.034
ARE THEY TURNED A DIFFERENT
DIRECTION?

19:37.068 --> 19:41.206
AND WHAT IS GOING ON WITH ALL OF
THESE LINES AROUND THE KEYS?

19:41.241 --> 19:47.517
CAN A GIRL GET A CLUE,
PLEASE?

19:47.551 --> 19:53.448
OH, MY GOSH.

19:53.482 --> 20:01.103
THIS LAST ROUND IS SO

20:01.137 --> 20:02.965
FRUSTRATING.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS IS.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.931
I HONESTLY THOUGHT WE MIGHT
BE MAKING A GUESS -- BUT I

20:07.965 --> 20:13.586
CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME SPOT
THE DIFFERENCE.

20:13.620 --> 20:18.310
I AM SO LOST I AM GOING BACK
TO -- MAYBE THE MONA LISA MAY BE

20:18.344 --> 20:22.344
THE ANSWER AGAIN.
HONESTLY, I JUST FEEL LIKE I

20:22.379 --> 20:25.000
AM RUNNING AROUND IN CIRCLES
OVER AND OVER.

20:25.034 --> 20:28.310
THE NEXT STOP IS THE
BATHROOM, THE WOMAN IN THE COMIC

20:28.344 --> 20:32.000
IS ASKING IF I WANT TO SEE HER
HOH ROOM AND IT IS LIKE, DON'T

20:32.034 --> 20:38.724
YOU MEAN MY HOH ROOM?
COMIC LADY, I AM COMING FOR

20:38.758 --> 20:41.862
YOUR THRONE.

20:41.896 --> 20:45.034
IN THE BATHROOM I AM LOOKING
AT THIS PAINTING AND TRYING TO

20:45.068 --> 20:49.068
SEE IF THE COLOR OF HER EYES
HAVE CHANGED, I AM COUNTING THE

20:49.103 --> 20:55.551
LINES IN THE BACKGROUND, I AM
LOOKING AT THE SHADOWS ON HER

20:55.586 --> 20:58.689
WARDROBE.
I HAVE LOOKED AT EVERY SINGLE

20:58.724 --> 21:01.275
PAINTING AND AT THIS POINT I
HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT COULD BE.

21:01.310 --> 21:06.172
I AM LOOKING AT EVERYTHING.
I AM -- I AM LOOKING ATHERODENT

21:06.206 --> 21:09.034
HANDS AND LOOKING AT HIS EYES
AND TAIL AND THEN I START

21:09.068 --> 21:13.068
LOOKING AT THE BRUSH STROKES IN
THE BACK AND I COUNT SIX AND 5.

21:13.103 --> 21:19.551
OOH MY GOSH.
IS ONE OF THOSE STROKES

21:19.586 --> 21:25.827
MISSING?

21:25.862 --> 21:30.379
I AM LEFT SCRATCHING MY HEAD.
I JUST PICKED THE MOST

21:30.413 --> 21:34.068
COMPLICATED PAINTING THAT HASN'T
BEEN FEATURED YET, SO THAT IS

21:34.103 --> 21:38.793
THE ONE I AM GOING WITH.
I HOPE I AM RIGHT.

21:38.827 --> 21:48.482
THIS IS SO -- I REALLY DON'T
KNOW IF IT IS RIGHT OR NOT.

21:48.517 --> 21:52.344
TODRICK, YOU ANSWERED FIRST
WITH PAINTING 6.

21:52.379 --> 21:55.827
IF YOU ARE RIGHT, YOU ARE THE
NEW HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.

21:55.862 --> 22:03.482
IF NOT, MIESHA WINS HER THIRD
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD COMPETITION.

22:03.517 --> 22:08.896
THE CORRECT ANSWER IS 6, A LINE
IS MISSING.

22:08.931 --> 22:11.655
TODRICK, YOU ARE THE NEXT
HOH!

22:11.689 --> 22:18.344
THANK YOU!
OH, MY GOSH, MOM, I WON

22:18.379 --> 22:21.034
SOMETHING!
AND I AM SO HAPPY!

22:21.068 --> 22:24.413
I HAVE BEEN WORKING MY BUTT
OFF BEHIND THE SCENES BUT NOW I

22:24.448 --> 22:28.034
HAVE THE KEY AND IT IS TIME FOR
ME TO START MAKING SOME MAJOR

22:28.068 --> 22:30.172
MOVES.
I MEAN, I ONLY HAVE TO GET THREE

22:30.206 --> 22:34.137
PEOPLE OUT OF THE WAY TO MAKE IT
TO ONE OF THOSE FINAL TWO

22:34.172 --> 22:37.827
CHAIRS.
TODRICK WON HOH, SO I DON'T

22:37.862 --> 22:41.241
EVEN KNOW IF I CAN GET REVENGE
FOR CARSON.

22:41.275 --> 22:46.344
I HAVE NO IDEA WHO TODRICK PLANS
TO PUT UP, BUT I AM SURE THAT I

22:46.379 --> 22:53.482
MIGHT BE ONE OF THEM.
I KNOW TODRICK WON'T PUT UP

22:53.517 --> 23:01.379
HIS BEST FRIEND MIESHA, SO THAT
LEAVES ONLY TODD AND MYSELF AND

23:01.413 --> 23:04.413
RIGHT NOW I DON'T KNOW, I AM

23:04.448 --> 23:08.379
WONDERING IF TODRICK WILL PUT ME
UP, I WORKED WITH TODRICK AT THE

23:08.413 --> 23:11.034
BEGINNING, AND IN THE MIDDLE,
THIS IS CLOSE TO THE END OF THE

23:11.068 --> 23:13.344
GAME SO I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY
STAND WITH ME RIGHT NOW.

23:13.379 --> 23:16.724
I HAVE NO IDEA.
I AM HOPING THEY ABIDE BY THE

23:16.758 --> 23:18.620
LOYALTY WE HAD AND DON'T PUT ME
UP AND PUT CYNTHIA AND LAMAR UP.

23:30.413 --> 23:32.413
TIRED, HOMEY, I HAVEN'T BEEN

23:32.448 --> 23:35.586
THIS TIRED IN A WHILE.
LET ME TELL YOU THIS, THOUGH.

23:35.620 --> 23:38.034
THEY PROBABLY WILL GET RID OF ME
BECAUSE I AM THE COMPETITION,

23:38.068 --> 23:44.482
THEY WILL GET RID OF ME.
I AM CLOSE --

23:44.517 --> 23:48.482
WHO, ME?
ME OR YOU.

23:48.517 --> 23:51.448
THEY ARE NOT AFRAID OF CYNTHIA.

23:51.482 --> 23:55.620
CYNTHIA AIN'T GOT ONE RIGHT,

23:55.655 --> 23:59.000
THE WHOLE TIME.
IT IS GETTING TO THE POINT

23:59.034 --> 24:01.689
WHERE YOU ARE TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT WHO YOU WANT TO SIT NEXT TO

24:01.724 --> 24:04.482
IN THE GAME, I DON'T THINK
PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO SIT NEXT

24:04.517 --> 24:08.000
TO ME AT THE END OF THE GAME
BECAUSE THEY KNOW I AM A PRETTY

24:08.034 --> 24:11.275
GOOD THREAT FOR THEM.
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF I GET

24:11.310 --> 24:14.137
TARGETED THIS WEEK TO GO HOME.
THEY ARER NOT AFRAID OF HER SO

24:14.172 --> 24:17.344
IT IS GOING TO BE ME.
I AM PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE.

24:17.379 --> 24:25.551
IT'S SCARY.

24:25.586 --> 24:29.724
HEY, GUYS.
WHO WANTS TO SEE MY HOH ROOM?

24:29.758 --> 24:34.413
YEAH, LET'S GO!
YAY!

24:34.448 --> 24:37.896
LAMAR, LAMAR IS UPSTAIRS IN
THE WORKOUT ROOM, I THINK.

24:37.931 --> 24:41.413
LAMAR!
WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT MY

24:41.448 --> 24:46.068
ROOM NOW IF YOU WANT TO COME.
I WILL BE RIGHT UP THERE, LET

24:46.103 --> 24:47.655
ME FINISH MY WORKOUT, 13 MINUTES.

24:47.689 --> 24:51.965
ARE YOU READY?
YEAH.

24:58.965 --> 25:04.137
LOOK AT THIS, TODRICK!
BABY TODRICK.

25:04.172 --> 25:07.655
THAT IS HYSTERICAL.
OH, MY GOODNESS.

25:07.689 --> 25:09.931
THIS IS REGINA AND GEORGE WHEN
THEY WERE BABIES.

25:09.965 --> 25:14.103
MY GOSH.
OH, MY GOODNESS.

25:14.137 --> 25:15.620
OKAY.
HERE IS MY --

25:15.655 --> 25:20.482
HELLO MY DARLING SON, I AM
EXTREMELY PROUD OF YOU.

25:20.517 --> 25:25.275
WE LOVE YOU, TODDY, ALL OF YOUR
FAMILY, FRIENDS AND FANS ARE

25:25.310 --> 25:27.689
CHEERING YOU.
I OFTEN ASKED MYSELF HOW COULD A

25:27.724 --> 25:30.862
WOMAN BE BLESSED WITH A CHILD
WHO IS SO GIFTED AND TALENTED?

25:30.896 --> 25:35.137
I AM NOT SURE BUT YOU GAVE YOU
TO ME BECAUSE I KNOW EXACTLY

25:35.172 --> 25:37.931
WHAT TO DO WITH YOU.
ONE THING IS FOR SURE I AM SO

25:37.965 --> 25:41.448
GLAD THAT YOU CHOSE ME AND I AM
DELIGHTED AND TRULY HONORED TO

25:41.482 --> 25:43.620
BE YOUR MOM. OH.

25:43.655 --> 25:47.068
I HOPE THAT YOU ARE DOING
EXCEPTIONALLY WELL LIVING OUT

25:47.103 --> 25:50.310
LOUD AND ENJOYING EVERY MOMENT,
AND REMEMBER WHEN YOU GET

25:50.344 --> 25:52.724
DISCOURAGED, HOLD YOUR HEAD UP
AND KEEP WALKING.

25:52.758 --> 25:55.896
ALWAYS LIVE YOUR BEST LIFE IN
THE MOMENT.

25:55.931 --> 25:59.551
ALWAYS DREAM BIG AND DREAM LOUD.
I LOVE YOU JUST THE WAY YOU WERE

25:59.586 --> 26:02.827
CREATED TO BE.
YOU AND ALL OF THAT AWESOMENESS,

26:02.862 --> 26:06.448
GO WELL, TODRICK, LOVE, MOM. AWW.

26:06.482 --> 26:08.896
THAT IS BEAUTIFUL.
OH, I LOVE IT.

26:08.931 --> 26:13.965
MY MOM IS SUCH AN INCREDIBLE
HUMAN BEING, BEING IN THIS HOUSE

26:14.000 --> 26:18.517
I HAVE REALLY CAME, GAINED A
HUGE RESPECT FOR MY MOM AND THE

26:18.551 --> 26:21.000
SACRIFICES THAT SHE MADE IN FOR
ME TO BE THE HUMAN BEING I AM

26:21.034 --> 26:23.379
TODAY.
I THINK THAT MY MOM ALWAYS WOULD

26:23.413 --> 26:26.206
HAVE PROBABLY REFERRED ME TO
PLAY BASKETBALL OR FOOTBALL, TO

26:26.241 --> 26:30.793
BE HONEST.
LIKE I KNOW THAT SHE WANTS TO BE

26:30.827 --> 26:33.931
LIKE, YES, TODRICK SO THIS IS
THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I HAVE

26:33.965 --> 26:36.275
DONE SOMETHING THAT I KNOW I
DON'T HAVE TO BE THERE.

26:36.310 --> 26:39.586
I KNOW THAT MY MOM IS IN HER
LIVING ROOM LIKE SCREAMING AND

26:39.620 --> 26:44.448
ROOTING ME ON AND IT WOULD MEAN
THE WORLD TO ME FOR MY MOM TO

26:44.482 --> 26:48.034
GET TO WATCH ME WIN "CELEBRITY
BIG BROTHER".

26:48.068 --> 26:51.241
I ALMOST WANT TO WIN THIS MORE
FOR HER THAN FOR ME.

26:51.275 --> 27:00.586
THANK YOU, MOM.

27:00.620 --> 27:10.931
OPEN, PLEASE.
ODOM IS ASKING IN.

27:10.965 --> 27:20.862
I USED TO --

27:20.896 --> 27:25.241
WHO ARE YOU?
THE WORLD'S MOST INTERESTING

27:25.275 --> 27:27.275
MAN.
GYMNASTICS --

27:27.310 --> 27:33.896
BASEBALL PLAYER, RODE HORSES.
YES, I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING.

27:33.931 --> 27:36.310
TODD IS A MAN OF MANY TRAITS.

27:36.344 --> 27:38.344
I HAVE KIND OF BEEN RIBBING ON
HIM FOR THAT.

27:38.379 --> 27:42.344
HE HAS LIVED A FULL LIFE, SO I
GET IT.

27:42.379 --> 27:44.655
HAVE YOU RODE ROAD IN A SPACE
SHUTTLE?

27:44.689 --> 27:46.000
NO, I WANT TO GET A SEAT, THOUGH.

27:46.034 --> 27:48.827
THAT IS CRAZY.
I DON'T THINK I WOULD RISK MY

27:48.862 --> 27:49.793
LIFE.
I WOULD.

27:49.827 --> 27:54.413
TO GO TO SPACE?
GOING TO OUTER SPACE IS

27:54.448 --> 27:57.275
SOMETHING THAT I HAVE ALWAYS
DREAMED OF, I COULD GO TO OUTER

27:57.310 --> 28:01.310
SPACE AND GO VISIT OTHER PLACES,
GET TO MEET NEW THINGS AND SEE

28:01.344 --> 28:04.689
YOU KNOW, ADVENTURE, HEY,
CAPTAIN KIRK WENT UP THERE, YOU

28:04.724 --> 28:08.034
KNOW, SHE 90 SOMETHING -- HE IS
90 SOMETHING YEARS OLD.

28:08.068 --> 28:09.793
IT IS LAST FRONTIER THAT
NEEDS TO BE EXPLORED.

28:09.827 --> 28:12.034
WHAT?
SOMEBODY LIVES UP THERE,

28:12.068 --> 28:14.034
HOMEY, YOU JUST DON'T KNOW.
SOMEBODY LIVES THERE.

28:14.068 --> 28:15.758
AND YOU ARE TRYING TO MEET
THEM?

28:15.793 --> 28:20.482
YEP.
AND --

28:20.517 --> 28:22.206
DUDE, WHY NOT?

28:22.241 --> 28:25.379
I JUST DON'T WANT TO.
THERE AIN'T NO MONEY UP

28:25.413 --> 28:27.172
THERE.
YES THERE IS.

28:27.206 --> 28:30.172
YOU MAY FIND A ROCK WORLD A,
WORTH A BILLION DOLLARS.

28:30.206 --> 28:32.758
SO YOU PLAN TO GET OUT OF THE SPACESHIP.

28:32.793 --> 28:34.482
HE IS ILL.
GET SOME MONEY.

28:34.517 --> 28:37.275
WHAT CONVERSATION DID I JUST
WALK INTO?

28:37.310 --> 28:40.379
NEITHER ONE OF THEM IS GOING
TO SPACE EVER, IT IS NEVER

28:40.413 --> 28:42.862
HAPPENING, I DON'T EVEN
UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS A

28:42.896 --> 28:44.758
DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW.
IT IS --

28:44.793 --> 28:51.655
YOU PROBABLY GET TO OUTER
SPACE WITH YOUR FARTS.

28:51.689 --> 28:59.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

28:59.034 --> 29:02.517
I AM REALLY TIRED OF BEING
HERE BUT THEN I AM THINKING

29:02.551 --> 29:06.000
ABOUT THE FACT THAT TOMORROW I
AM PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO

29:06.034 --> 29:08.413
MAKE THE NOMINATION AND THAT IS
ALREADY STRESSING ME OUT.

29:08.448 --> 29:12.103
WELL, THAT IS THE POSITION.
WE HAVE TO NOMINATE

29:12.137 --> 29:13.620
50 PERCENT OF THE HOUSE AT THIS POINT.

29:13.655 --> 29:18.000
WE ARE DOWN TO THE FINAL
5 AND NOW THAT CARSON IS GONE,

29:18.034 --> 29:21.103
TODD IS THE ONLY REMAINING HUGE
THREAT IN THE HOUSE.

29:21.137 --> 29:26.206
TODD HAS WON HOH AND HE
ALMOST JUST BEAT MIESHA AND I IN

29:26.241 --> 29:28.758
THE COMPETITION AND I THINK HE
IS THE SCARIEST PERSON TO REMAIN

29:28.793 --> 29:32.413
IN THIS HOUSE AND MIESHA AND I
HAVE A CHANCE OF THE GETTING TO

29:32.448 --> 29:36.655
THE FINAL TWO.
TODD, HAS GOT TO GO.

29:36.689 --> 29:46.034
I ALREADY KNOW WHAT I NEED TO
DO, SO YOU ARE GOING UP.

29:46.068 --> 29:51.172
LIKE, OKAY, I WILL GO PACK MY BAGS.

29:51.206 --> 29:57.379
SO WE ARE GOING TO PUT TODD
AND --

29:57.413 --> 30:01.758
IF TODD WINS THE VETO --
WE WILL PUT CYNTHIA UP.

30:01.793 --> 30:05.206
AND JUST --
AND JUST SEND HER HOME.

30:05.241 --> 30:07.620
I AM HOPING TODD DOESN'T DO WELL
IN WHATEVER THE VETO IS.

30:07.655 --> 30:10.137
YES.
YOU CAN TELL THEY REALLY

30:10.172 --> 30:17.482
WANTED TO WIN.
IF THEY GO IN THERE WITH GAME

30:17.517 --> 30:19.000
FACE ON.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY WAITED

30:19.034 --> 30:21.931
SO LONG UNTIL THIS POINT IN THE
GAME TO REALLY PLAY HARD,

30:21.965 --> 30:23.000
THOUGH.
THEY REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN

30:23.034 --> 30:26.034
PLAYING WITH TODD.
AND JUST A LITTLE TOO LATE.

30:26.068 --> 30:28.758
CYNTHIA WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED.

30:28.793 --> 30:31.965
I ALSO THINK SHE UNDERSTOOD.
UNDERSTOOD WHAT?

30:32.000 --> 30:36.551
OKAY, OKAY.
I THINK SHE HAS BEEN

30:36.586 --> 30:39.758
UNDERSTANDING OF, EVEN IF SHE --
UNDERSTAND --

30:39.793 --> 30:41.965
EXACTLY.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.275
I THINK WE ARE GOING TO MAKE

30:43.310 --> 30:45.586
IT TO THE END.
I AM PRETTY SURE.

30:45.620 --> 30:49.068
IT IS NOT A GREAT FEELING TO
HAVE TO TARGET PEOPLE THAT YOU

30:49.103 --> 30:53.379
HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH.
BUT LET'S BE HONEST.

30:53.413 --> 30:57.482
TODD IS A THREAT IN THIS GAME,
AND WE ARE IN THE FINAL 5, ALL

30:57.517 --> 31:01.379
BETS ARE OFF AT THIS POINT. OH.

31:01.413 --> 31:03.827
WHAT A DAY.
WHAT A WEEK, WHAT A MONTH,

31:03.862 --> 31:04.655
WHAT A LIFE.

31:14.620 --> 31:17.103
OKAY, SEE, NOW IT IS GETTING
TOO LOW AGAIN.

31:17.137 --> 31:19.413
WHAT THE HELL, DUDE?
I HAD TO TAKE MY BLOOD

31:19.448 --> 31:22.965
PRESSURE EVERY DAY TO MAKE SURE
MY BLOOD PRESSURE IS STALE.

31:23.000 --> 31:27.724
DO YOU DO IT LIKE THIS OR --
LAMAR, OF COURSE, ALWAYS

31:27.758 --> 31:30.620
WANTS TO BET ON EVERYTHING.
I BET MINE IS LOW.

31:30.655 --> 31:34.586
I BET YOU.
127 OVER -- THAT IS

31:34.620 --> 31:37.103
EXCELLENT.
THE BOTTOM NUMBER, YOU WANT

31:37.137 --> 31:38.758
THE BOTTOM NUMBER TO BE UNDER 80.

31:38.793 --> 31:41.551
LAMAR ALWAYS IS TRYING TO OUT DO
ME, TIGHTEN IT UP.

31:41.586 --> 31:45.137
HE HATES TO LOSE, LAMAR
NIGHTS LOSE SO IF YOU BEAT HIM

31:45.172 --> 31:48.689
IN SOMETHING, YOU GOT HIM -- AND
HE WILL BE UPSET FOR A LITTLE

31:48.724 --> 31:51.448
WHILE, THEN HE GETS BETTER.
READY?

31:51.482 --> 31:54.896
WILL YOU HELP ME?
WILL YOU LET ME DIE?

31:54.931 --> 31:59.482
WHAT COULD I DO?
I WOULD WHOOP YOUR ASS.

31:59.517 --> 32:03.448
I WILL --
BRO, THAT IS HIGH.

32:03.482 --> 32:06.862
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
I GOT YOU, HOMEY.

32:06.896 --> 32:12.137
I GOT YOU.
NOW WHAT?

32:12.172 --> 32:15.241
LAMAR IS COMPETITIVE IN EVERY SITUATION.

32:15.275 --> 32:18.689
YOU KNOW, NBA CHAMPIONSHIP
WINNER TWICE, I GUESS THAT'S THE

32:18.724 --> 32:20.655
REASON WHY.
ARE YOU READY?

32:20.689 --> 32:22.965
,.
HOLD ON.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.379
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO.
HOLD THE BAG.

32:25.413 --> 32:27.448
YOU -- YOU AIN'T GOING TO BE
LOWER THAN ME.

32:27.482 --> 32:31.172
JUST WATCH.
I BEAT YOU WITH 91 OVER HERE.

32:31.206 --> 32:34.068
HUH-UH, I BEAT YOU --
YOU TOOK THE BET RIGHT HERE.

32:34.103 --> 32:36.724
I HAD 91.
91 OVER HERE.

32:36.758 --> 32:39.931
YEAH, YOU DID -- YOU CAN'T DO
BOTH ARMS?

32:39.965 --> 32:42.689
THAT WAS HIGH OVER THERE.
I DID THIS ARM, IT WAS 91, SO

32:42.724 --> 32:47.034
THERE YOU GO.
WE HAD THE CARDIOVASCULAR

32:47.068 --> 32:49.344
CASINO, YOU KNOW, BUT I BEAT HIM
BUT HE WON'T ACCEPT THAT.

32:49.379 --> 32:52.448
, NO I WON.
YOU ARE JUST TRYING TO CHEAT

32:52.482 --> 33:05.000
ME AND BE A DOUBLE CHEATER.

33:05.034 --> 33:07.413
OF ALL THE BETS TOO --
YEP.

33:07.448 --> 33:12.689
I LIKE IT TO BE CLEAN IN HERE.
I THINK TODRICK HAS PLAYED

33:12.724 --> 33:13.827
EVERYONE TO KEEP HIM RIGHT THERE.

33:13.862 --> 33:16.448
HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GONE
WEEKS AGO.

33:16.482 --> 33:20.827
HELLO, TODD, WELCOME TO MY WORLD.

33:20.862 --> 33:24.896
WITH TODRICK BEING HOH WE ALL
FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TARGETS ON OUR

33:24.931 --> 33:27.482
BACK, THE ONLY PERSON SAFE IN
THIS HOUSE IS MIESHA.

33:27.517 --> 33:29.724
CARSON KEPT HIM IN.
SO DID I.

33:29.758 --> 33:32.137
HE FLAYED HELL OUT OF THE GAME.

33:32.172 --> 33:33.965
CARSON FOR A FAVOR, CARSON
SAVED HIM.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.137
YOU ASKED CARSON NOT TO PUT
HIM UP, HE DIDN'T, BECAUSE IF HE

33:38.172 --> 33:41.724
PUT HIM UP HE WOULD BE GONE.
I KNOW I AM UP ON THE BLOCK.

33:41.758 --> 33:45.034
WE WILL ALL BE, IF NOT THIS
TIME NEXT TIME.

33:45.068 --> 33:50.241
HERE IS THE THING, IF YOU --
IF WE TWIN VETO WE CAN PULL

33:50.275 --> 33:52.275
OURSELVES OFF THE BLOCK.
IF YOU WIN HOH MONDAY --

33:52.310 --> 33:54.448
THEN, YES, THAT HAPPENS BUT
--

33:54.482 --> 33:55.758
I THINK I WILL BE GONE ON MONDAY.

33:55.793 --> 33:57.965
I WOULD DEFINITELY BE FOOLISH
NOT TO BE NERVOUS.

33:58.000 --> 34:04.482
HE KNOWS I AM A THREAT TO HIM
AND HIS SURVIVAL IN THIS GAME,

34:04.517 --> 34:06.344
AND MIESHA WILL BE GUNNING FOR ME.

34:06.379 --> 34:09.758
THEY CONTROL THE VOTE.
IT COULD BE TODD, ME, YOU OR

34:09.793 --> 34:11.034
LAMAR.
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

34:11.068 --> 34:14.275
IT IS GOING TO BE ME PROBABLY
AND LAMAR.

34:14.310 --> 34:18.000
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT?
BECAUSE I JUST KNOW HOW THEY

34:18.034 --> 34:24.758
ARE PLAYING THE GAME.
OH, LORD HAVE MERCY.

34:24.793 --> 34:36.620
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, I
HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE THE

34:36.655 --> 34:40.379
HOH, AND THIS MIGHT BE MY ONLY
SHOT, SO THIS CEREMONY IS GOING

34:40.413 --> 34:52.517
