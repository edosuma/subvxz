I was afraid the dragon

wouldn't cough
the moon back up.

02:41.452 --> 02:44.455

coughs the moon back up!

02:44.539 --> 02:45.665

02:45.748 --> 02:48.543
but I must again point out
there is no dragon.

02:48.626 --> 02:52.046
Then why am I paying
$800 a year in dragon insurance?

02:52.130 --> 02:53.923
Again, I maintain
that money would be

02:54.007 --> 02:55.884
better spent
on car insurance.

02:55.967 --> 02:59.345

dragons do not attack cars.

04:16.881 --> 04:19.133
But Bunkerball
is keeping us sane!

04:20.760 --> 04:23.054
Do we really have to sit here
the whole time?

04:23.137 --> 04:25.056
I mean, if we went out now,

04:25.139 --> 04:27.267
it might be cool
to see the town empty.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.394
Yeah, I could sneak into
the school and write whatever

04:29.477 --> 04:31.145
I want on the chalkboard!

04:31.229 --> 04:32.897
I could see a planetarium show

04:32.981 --> 04:35.066
without the secondhand
marijuana!

04:35.149 --> 04:38.653

04:42.073 --> 04:43.992

04:44.075 --> 04:45.326
That's odd.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.662

Pull over.

05:02.844 --> 05:05.388
made possible
by the fake disaster drill.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.515
And a special thanks
for the hard work

05:07.598 --> 05:09.726
of the Mystery And Secrecy
Committee.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.477
We have names, you know.

05:11.561 --> 05:14.063
Quit complaining!
You only meet once a month!

05:14.147 --> 05:16.691
Yes, but the meetings last
eight hours!

05:16.774 --> 05:18.026
Shut up! Shut up!

05:18.109 --> 05:19.819
This is the most
fun I have!

05:20.987 --> 05:24.907

we are here.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.159
What's going on?

05:26.242 --> 05:27.952
Why is there
a picture of us?

05:28.036 --> 05:28.995
This isn't good.

05:29.078 --> 05:30.830
Oh, honey,
why must you always assume

05:30.913 --> 05:32.332
that a huge picture of us

05:32.415 --> 05:35.752
at a secret meeting we weren't
told about is a bad thing?

05:35.835 --> 05:38.463
The results are in: this town
has voted unanimously

05:38.546 --> 05:41.632
to get rid of Springfield's
unending nightmare:

05:41.716 --> 05:43.509
the Simpsons.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.428
ALL:
D'oh!

05:45.511 --> 05:47.597
They're here!
The monsters are here!

05:47.680 --> 05:49.557
Moe, it's me, Marge.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.517
I'm your friend.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.728
The monster queen
is coming on to me!

06:00.151 --> 06:02.695
Why would you want
to banish us from Springfield?

06:02.779 --> 06:05.156
Yeah.
We're like family to you.

06:05.239 --> 06:08.576
I'm talking to you,
headphone-bus-driver guy.

06:08.659 --> 06:11.371
I'll have you know
I'm also a hair donor!

06:11.454 --> 06:14.499
Salma Hayek wore me
to the Oscars!

06:14.582 --> 06:17.460
This is not about who wore
whose hair where.

06:17.543 --> 06:19.629
We are here
to banish the Simpsons,

06:19.712 --> 06:22.131
although we are not pleased
to be doing so.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.966
-I am!
-Me, too.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.885
I feel like a kid at Christmas!

06:25.968 --> 06:27.970
I believe you know my position.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.514
I know we're all happy.

06:29.597 --> 06:32.558
I'm just trying
to spare their feelings.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.644
Those freaks have no feelings!

06:34.727 --> 06:36.396
Even baby never cry!

06:36.479 --> 06:38.398
MAN:
She's a freak!

06:38.481 --> 06:39.899
What baby does that?!

06:39.982 --> 06:42.985
Why would an entire town
go to all this fuss

06:43.069 --> 06:44.695
to get rid of one family?

06:44.779 --> 06:47.073
What have we done
that's so terrible?

06:47.156 --> 06:48.616
I'm glad you asked.

06:48.699 --> 06:51.285
The simple fact is
the city is going broke

06:51.369 --> 06:53.830

drunken shenanigans...

06:53.913 --> 06:55.832

06:58.000 --> 07:01.254
Homer, that is not
banishment-hearing behavior!

07:01.337 --> 07:03.381
...Bart's pranks,
which dwindle in humor

07:03.464 --> 07:05.383
as they rise in destruction...

07:05.466 --> 07:07.468
(audience booing)

07:07.552 --> 07:10.221
...and Lisa's environmental
initiatives...

07:12.557 --> 07:13.724
If I may speak.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.143

07:15.226 --> 07:16.310
We're not monsters.

07:16.394 --> 07:17.854
We're just people.

07:17.937 --> 07:21.190
People who love each other
and love this town,

07:21.274 --> 07:23.860
(voice breaks)
the only place we've ever called home.

07:23.943 --> 07:25.403
Thank you.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.073
(sobs)

07:29.157 --> 07:30.700
Marge, you are a sweet woman

07:30.783 --> 07:33.953
and you make us see your family
in a more forgiving light.

07:34.036 --> 07:35.246
Thank you.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.665
Which is why you're
the worst Simpson of all!

07:37.748 --> 07:39.417
-Huh?!
-ALL: Yeah, yeah!

07:39.500 --> 07:41.377
Now, now, now
just a second here.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.296
Now, I know we're not perfect.

07:43.379 --> 07:46.716
but, uh, I believe it was
Sammy Hagar who said...

07:46.799 --> 07:47.884
SIDESHOW MEL:
Silence!

07:47.967 --> 07:48.926
D'oh!

07:57.143 --> 07:59.061
Now, I like a good old-fashioned
witch trial

07:59.145 --> 08:00.938
as much as the next person,

08:01.022 --> 08:03.024
but I do not think
we should be so quick

08:03.107 --> 08:04.525
to judge our longtime
neighbors.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.277
Not so fast, Flanders.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.446
We knew you'd be
the voice of mercy,

08:08.529 --> 08:11.699
and we're prepared
to answer your concerns.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.784

engine stalling)

11:27.311 --> 11:28.646

11:28.729 --> 11:29.897
Springfield talk!

11:29.980 --> 11:31.565
Well, how are we supposed
to get fuel?

11:31.649 --> 11:33.943
Private plane crashes.

11:34.026 --> 11:36.862
Ah, smell that
unpolluted air!

11:36.946 --> 11:38.989
You know,
I'm glad we're in exile.

11:39.073 --> 11:41.617
Yep, I never realized
how much I hated

11:41.701 --> 11:44.203
every single one of my
friends and relatives.

11:44.286 --> 11:47.331
I don't think this place
is so great.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.125
(hissing)

11:49.208 --> 11:51.460
I'm trying to make
the best of things,

11:51.544 --> 11:54.422

is falling in with a bad crowd.

11:54.505 --> 11:57.508

11:57.591 --> 12:00.386

and I want to go back.

12:00.469 --> 12:01.929
It's not perfect here,

12:02.012 --> 12:03.055
but it is close to nature

12:03.139 --> 12:04.640
and if you have
an ax to grind,

12:04.724 --> 12:06.851
WikiLeaks is right over there.

12:06.934 --> 12:08.853

12:08.936 --> 12:10.855

Mr. Assange?

12:10.938 --> 12:12.314
That's my personal

to know about it.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.945
Hey, but we're neighbors.

12:18.028 --> 12:20.156
would you like to come over
for a movie sometime?

12:20.239 --> 12:22.742
Is it Iraqi journalists
being murdered?

12:22.825 --> 12:23.868
Don't be ridiculous.

12:23.951 --> 12:25.161
It's an Afghan wedding
being bombed.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.245
Aw...

12:26.328 --> 12:29.290
Well I've got a really big
secret for you.

12:29.373 --> 12:32.042

12:44.597 --> 12:46.849

the Springfield sign

12:46.932 --> 12:49.018
and how every street
is a dead end.

12:49.101 --> 12:51.520
God help me, I even
miss Helen Lovejoy

12:51.604 --> 12:53.814

12:53.898 --> 12:55.399

12:55.483 --> 12:57.026
Hey, baby, banned forever

12:57.109 --> 12:58.986

go back sometimes.

12:59.069 --> 13:01.322
-Yes, it does.
-Pipe down, boy!

13:01.405 --> 13:04.074

back into Springfield.

13:19.507 --> 13:22.218
Mr. Burns, you might catch
a cold out this late.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.511
You want my jacket?

13:23.594 --> 13:25.554
Here, let me warm
my gun up for you.

13:27.431 --> 13:28.891

Excellent!

13:28.974 --> 13:31.811
Yeah, it wouldn't be you
if you didn't say "excellent."

13:34.146 --> 13:36.482

13:36.565 --> 13:39.151
(slurring) You know what's great
about you, Marge?

13:39.235 --> 13:42.863
After all these years, you can
still shinny up the donut

13:42.947 --> 13:44.990

Remember when we moved in

14:17.022 --> 14:18.899

and I talked like this?

14:18.983 --> 14:20.067

-Right, Lou?
-Uh, what breed, Chief?

15:17.166 --> 15:20.127
I mean, I saw an Abyssinian once
who could change channels.

15:20.210 --> 15:21.879
Eh, that is pretty smart.

15:21.962 --> 15:23.297
All right,

15:23.380 --> 15:26.550

throw us out of town again?

Crucify them!

15:28.093 --> 15:29.887

15:29.970 --> 15:31.639

15:31.722 --> 15:34.516
Cancel their subscription

15:34.600 --> 15:35.517

about shooting.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.027
I did, just now.

shooting us.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.414

place that we love,

15:57.498 --> 15:59.333
a place that may not
have indoor plumbing,

15:59.416 --> 16:01.961
but it's got something
we treasure more.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.587
