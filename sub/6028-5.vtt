00:04.720 --> 00:07.079
- What do you mean, I can't have cheese?
- I can put cheese on it.

00:07.160 --> 00:10.159
I'm just saying it doesn't come with...
But that's fine. I can...

00:10.240 --> 00:13.159
Mate, I just want burger
with cheese and bacon, that's all.

00:13.240 --> 00:16.559
- So, you want bacon as well?
- What, I can't fucking have bacon now?

00:17.360 --> 00:20.719
No, you can.
I just need to...

00:20.800 --> 00:25.119
It doesn't come with cheese and bacon,
so I just need to add it.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.079
Well, add it, then.
Stop backchatting me.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.199
I'm not. Honestly.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.079
- I'm not.
- Look at you.

00:31.160 --> 00:34.119
Grown man flipping burgers.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.999
Is this what you wanted do with your life?
Fucking... Terrence.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.919
Is it, Terrence?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.959
Is it?

02:04.000 --> 02:07.039
Janus wasn't in Utopia.
It was in me.

02:07.120 --> 02:08.319
My own dad did that to me.

02:09.440 --> 02:12.239
Nice jacket. How come a knob-face like you
has suddenly grown a...

02:12.320 --> 02:14.399
Grant, for fuck's sake!
We're doing something. Just piss off!

02:14.480 --> 02:16.239
When Ian discovers
that we've killed Roy...

02:16.320 --> 02:18.879
Killed? No, wait.
Just hang on a minute.

02:18.960 --> 02:22.359
Michael... I'm going to help you
get your family back.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.919
I'm going to call either Paul
or one of the other two...

02:25.000 --> 02:28.239
... and in about 90 days that person
will release the most deadly flu...

02:28.320 --> 02:31.039
- ... this world has ever seen.
- I chose.

02:31.120 --> 02:35.479
You mean, a race? You chose a race?
And which race did you choose?

02:35.560 --> 02:37.159
Dovadă. Dovadă.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.479
- What does that mean?
- Dovadă means "proof"'.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.519
It means "proof"'.

02:43.840 --> 02:45.919
You're coming with us.

02:48.240 --> 02:49.279
Grant!

02:51.880 --> 02:53.479
Ian?

02:54.000 --> 02:55.439
Ian!

02:55.520 --> 02:58.319
Ian, please!
Ian, what are you doing?

02:58.400 --> 02:59.719
I'm getting Grant back.

02:59.800 --> 03:03.479
What? Are you trying to find a weapon?
Is that it?

03:04.120 --> 03:07.399
Right. Well, that's a curtain pole, Ian.
You've got a curtain pole.

03:07.480 --> 03:10.359
- On, so you just wanna leave him?
- Pietre is a killing machine.

03:10.440 --> 03:14.319
If he wanted to kill Grant,
Grant would be dead. We all would.

03:14.400 --> 03:15.919
We won't find him.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.279
So, let's just calm down
and work out what to do next.

03:31.760 --> 03:34.239
- Oh, that... that's not very good.
- We're not getting fucking married.

03:34.320 --> 03:36.759
No, no, she was smiling.

03:37.720 --> 03:39.279
Don't smile.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.559
You just have to ask,
Jessica.

03:45.560 --> 03:50.199
- Who does he send that to?
- Leah Gorsand, Rochane Foundation.

03:53.320 --> 03:57.239
- Are you really Mr. Rabbit, then?
- Surprising, isn't it?

03:59.800 --> 04:02.719
I see the Americans
are entering the Yellow Sea.

04:02.800 --> 04:07.679
- That's a worrying escalation.
- So, that story about you in China...

04:07.760 --> 04:11.159
... escaping, killing all those people,
is that true, then?

04:11.240 --> 04:14.919
Are you asking me,
"am I a killer", Michael?

04:15.480 --> 04:17.279
Yes, I am.

04:17.360 --> 04:20.799
I didn't want to be.
It's just the way it turned out.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.719
- Like Churchill or Lincoln.
- Or Hitler.

04:30.680 --> 04:33.719
Always surprises me
how quickly these things escalate.

04:33.800 --> 04:37.199
One minute, it's a disagreement
about wheat and land rights...

04:37.280 --> 04:39.599
... and the next
it's a nuclear standoff.

04:41.640 --> 04:44.319
Jen and Alice are dead,
by the way.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.439
You're killing them.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.519
Right now. This minute.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.519
Or you could untie me.

04:54.840 --> 04:57.799
Don't send that
from here, okay?

04:57.880 --> 05:00.479
Tell them to back off,
or she dies...

05:00.560 --> 05:04.759
... and if I even smell them
near my dad or Ian, she's dead.

05:04.840 --> 05:07.319
I don't want any attention
drawn to them.

05:07.400 --> 05:08.839
None.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.079
Too late.

05:11.720 --> 05:15.079
- The body was discovered in a warehouse.
- Whoops.

05:15.160 --> 05:17.399
Police say the victim
was tied to a chair...

05:17.480 --> 05:20.079
... and killed with a single gunshot
to the head.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.439
Becky?

05:28.760 --> 05:31.119
Do you think he had family?

05:31.640 --> 05:34.439
We need to get rid of him.
Our DNA's all over this place.

05:34.520 --> 05:37.639
What, like... dispose?

05:38.400 --> 05:41.879
So, we get rid of bodies now?
We're like killers?

05:42.800 --> 05:47.279
I'll do it. You... find out
how to get rid of the DNA.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.079
Yeah.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.359
Oh, my God.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.559
Ian.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.999
I'm so sorry.

06:18.080 --> 06:21.039
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
What do I do about Jen and Alice?

06:21.120 --> 06:24.439
I mean, I have to get them out now.
You... you said you'd help me.

06:24.520 --> 06:29.119
I can't stay. I planted a phone on Ian.
The battery will run out.

06:29.200 --> 06:32.359
My dad's with him.
I have to, Michael.

06:32.440 --> 06:36.039
Look, find out where they have them.
Take a mobile, the GPS.

06:36.120 --> 06:39.559
They search me. They fucking search me.
How do I get a phone in there?

06:39.640 --> 06:42.119
Shove it up your arse.

06:42.200 --> 06:46.079
No, I'm serious.
You have to shove it up your arse.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.919
It's the only way.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.999
Don't use a big one.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.879
So...

07:02.120 --> 07:06.319
- ... th-they're saying I... I killed him?
- Ian, I'm so sorry.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.239
No, no, no,
it's... it's all right. Um...

07:09.320 --> 07:12.239
I mean,
it's... it's fine, it's just...

07:14.640 --> 07:17.319
So... so what?
He's... he's dead?

07:20.920 --> 07:22.599
Right... right.

07:23.320 --> 07:28.039
Yeah, um... so, what...
what were we doing? We're...

07:28.120 --> 07:30.559
And... and Marius,
I... I need to get rid of...

07:30.640 --> 07:32.919
- Ian.
- No, no, no. No.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.119
- What does my mum think?
- She... she thinks...

07:41.200 --> 07:43.919
- ... you did it.
- What?

07:44.000 --> 07:46.799
Should... should I tell her
I... I didn't, then?

07:46.880 --> 07:51.079
You can't go near her.
That's what they want you to do.

07:55.640 --> 07:59.679
So, I was doing...
I was doing something and...

08:00.680 --> 08:06.319
Oh, yeah. Bl-bleach. Bleach.
Um... I was... I was bleaching...

08:41.800 --> 08:44.199
So, what's the plan, then?

08:44.280 --> 08:46.119
I don't have a plan.

08:47.880 --> 08:49.799
I know this area.

08:49.880 --> 08:51.759
It's remote.

08:51.840 --> 08:55.239
There's an old base.
I trained there as a boy.

08:55.320 --> 08:59.119
Sometimes they would
take me out here on the hills.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.439
Holidays, I suppose.

09:00.520 --> 09:03.959
So, what, we're just gonna wander round
like fucking twats?

09:04.040 --> 09:07.279
If we meet anyone,
behave yourself.

09:07.360 --> 09:10.799
I'm your dad.
He's your grandfather.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.959
You're my dad?
All right, Dad?

09:18.320 --> 09:21.479
- Were you going to kill Ian, then?
- You shouldn't talk about killing.

09:21.560 --> 09:25.439
Why not?
I'm not like other people now.

09:25.520 --> 09:28.679
I'm different, like you.

09:28.760 --> 09:32.559
- You are not like me.
- Yes, I am. Why am I not?

09:32.640 --> 09:34.999
Come on. We're leaving.

09:36.480 --> 09:38.159
Why am I not like you?

09:39.680 --> 09:42.239
Oi, dickhead!
Why am I not like you?

09:57.880 --> 10:00.039
There are no clues
as to where it is.

10:00.120 --> 10:03.639
Curtains closed, so you can't see out.
There is a child's drawing.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.959
It's called "Ice".

10:06.040 --> 10:09.439
Ice? Have you shown this
to anyone else?

10:09.520 --> 10:12.119
I didn't think panic was good.

10:13.240 --> 10:15.479
Why me? Why show me?

10:15.560 --> 10:17.719
She believes in you, dear.

10:17.800 --> 10:21.679
Janus is at a critical stage.
Commands need to be given.

10:21.760 --> 10:24.159
By Mr. Rabbit.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.479
But no-one knows
she is Mr. Rabbit.

10:28.560 --> 10:33.399
I mean, she must lead at arm's length,
like, what? Dead drops and codes and...

10:33.480 --> 10:37.839
Yes, there is a complicated and
highly secretive command structure.

10:37.920 --> 10:40.079
And do you know it?

10:40.160 --> 10:43.319
I know... some of it.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.959
Tell no-one.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.679
And Mr. Rabbit?

10:53.360 --> 10:55.959
For the moment,
we are Mr. Rabbit.

12:10.640 --> 12:11.559
Becky?

12:11.640 --> 12:13.519
I ask question, yes?

12:13.600 --> 12:15.839
Is there something here?

12:15.920 --> 12:17.319
Is mark?

12:23.520 --> 12:25.079
Tell you what.

12:25.160 --> 12:26.399
Is okay.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.879
I can keep my chips...

12:29.720 --> 12:33.119
- ... in there.
- Oh, God, please...

12:35.000 --> 12:37.119
Eat my fucking chip!

13:02.520 --> 13:05.839
- Are you all right?
- I... I don't know where Donaldson is.

13:05.920 --> 13:10.239
The Thoraxin's experimental.
He said it's like a secret lab in China.

13:10.320 --> 13:13.079
I tried to find it once.
No good.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.039
And without it?

13:19.680 --> 13:21.119
Look.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.359
There... there's gonna come
a time...

13:23.440 --> 13:26.919
I mean, if...
if I want a choice...

13:27.920 --> 13:32.199
... then I'm gonna need to do it
when I'm well enough.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.279
Will you help me...

13:36.760 --> 13:38.639
... please?

13:44.520 --> 13:47.799
Come on, let's go and find out
what side Dugdale's on.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.919
It's fucking nice, all this.

14:04.520 --> 14:06.319
Mountains and shit.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.839
Yeah... I like this.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.919
What is it?

14:16.000 --> 14:19.999
I remember a stone hut
somewhere near.

14:20.520 --> 14:25.479
I thought it had grass on the roof,
but they said "moss".

14:25.560 --> 14:27.639
It was nice.

14:28.920 --> 14:32.279
The kind of place
a father takes a son.

14:34.320 --> 14:37.559
Is that where we're going?
You and me?

14:42.320 --> 14:44.359
Acesta este mirt de mlastina.

14:44.440 --> 14:50.759
Bun pentru a tine
insectele la distanta.

14:52.840 --> 14:55.919
Si puteti sa-I mananci.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.799
Come on,
you dumb bastard.

15:06.880 --> 15:10.079
Let's go find
this stupid fucking hut.

16:03.720 --> 16:06.079
There's no ice. Sun.

16:06.160 --> 16:09.119
Fields. A horse.
There's no ice in this.

16:09.200 --> 16:12.399
Something has come up.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.639
What? What's come up?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.999
Newsprint.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.239
How very traditional.

16:24.040 --> 16:28.559
I mean, they know. So, we have to pay
and this isn't a large amount.

16:28.640 --> 16:31.039
20 million in cash is large.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.759
Yes, but we can do it.
I mean Janus.

16:33.840 --> 16:36.039
We've all worked so hard...

16:36.120 --> 16:40.239
They don't say what denomination.
Dollars. Sterling.

16:40.320 --> 16:42.919
- Euros.
- Sterling. It's sterling.

16:43.760 --> 16:47.359
I mean, we're in England.
Of course he wants sterling.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.319
Really?

16:48.400 --> 16:50.679
Our highest denomination
is the £50 note.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.919
One million of which
would weigh 24.2kg.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.799
20 million would weigh
nearly half a tonne.

16:55.880 --> 17:00.559
Now compare that to the 500 euro note,
which would be just 45 kilos.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.839
He could fit it
into a suitcase.

17:05.640 --> 17:07.039
If he's a he.

17:08.200 --> 17:11.959
Look, where is she? I'm a minister.
Why aren't I talking to her?

17:12.040 --> 17:16.439
We'll pay. You're right.
Janus is more important than...

17:17.760 --> 17:19.439
... everything.

17:22.120 --> 17:24.399
Did you want something else?

17:26.880 --> 17:27.759
Er... no.

17:34.720 --> 17:40.239
- I didn't think he was this stupid.
- Oh, he's not stupid. He's just...

17:48.480 --> 17:50.559
He's just desperate.

17:55.760 --> 17:57.319
Ice.

18:37.640 --> 18:40.159
Oh, ya bastard!

18:49.800 --> 18:52.159
I'm not with them.
They have Jen and Alice.

18:52.240 --> 18:54.879
I've had no choice.
Oh! Just...

18:54.960 --> 18:57.599
Look... look around.
They're not here!

18:57.680 --> 18:58.999
- Ian.
- They've got Jen and Alice.

18:59.080 --> 19:00.039
Ian, shall I take that?

19:00.120 --> 19:02.559
Look, I think he might be telling
the truth.

19:02.640 --> 19:05.039
Shall... shall I take
that knife, then?

19:09.680 --> 19:12.759
Okay.
I think we all need to talk.

19:17.480 --> 19:20.079
So, all this is sort of...

19:20.160 --> 19:21.919
... racist?

19:25.840 --> 19:28.519
Well, does anybody else know?

19:28.600 --> 19:32.079
No, just us.
We think if we take them that...

19:32.160 --> 19:35.919
I mean, they have a virus, Russian flu.
They're gonna...

19:36.000 --> 19:37.759
No, no, no, they faked that.

19:37.840 --> 19:41.719
No, they're not faking it this time.
It's real.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.879
That's how they get everyone
to take the vaccine.

19:43.960 --> 19:45.319
And...

19:45.880 --> 19:47.039
... this is proof?

19:47.120 --> 19:50.959
We think it shows what Carvel did to it,
like the racist bit.

19:51.040 --> 19:56.279
We reckon if... if we take them that,
then they might, like... stop.

19:56.360 --> 20:00.839
- Or they might kill us.
- So, Milner...

20:02.760 --> 20:04.919
Milner's Mr. Rabbit?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.879
She's responsible
for... for all this?

20:07.960 --> 20:09.999
She played us.

20:10.760 --> 20:12.839
Jessica has her now.

20:13.680 --> 20:17.759
She's gone to find you, in fact.
They think you have Carvel.

20:17.840 --> 20:20.439
She hid a phone
in your jacket.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.079
Shit. Grant's wearing my jacket.

20:22.160 --> 20:24.759
Well, hang on.
When did she hide a phone in your jacket?

20:24.840 --> 20:26.399
Oh, I...

20:26.960 --> 20:28.999
I-I came here. I saw her.

20:29.080 --> 20:32.519
- Right. You never said.
- Well, yeah, I didn't get time.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.519
- I beg your fucking pardon?
- Sorry, is this really the time?

20:35.600 --> 20:38.719
No, shut up, you!
Why didn't you say?

20:46.040 --> 20:48.879
No, this... this isn't me.
I swear to Christ.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.159
Go! Go! Go!

20:50.240 --> 20:51.839
- Come on!
- Oh, my God!

20:55.280 --> 20:58.119
Armed police!
Get on the floor!

20:58.200 --> 21:00.279
Down on the floor!

21:00.360 --> 21:02.159
Get down! Do not move!

21:14.560 --> 21:16.199
All right?

21:25.760 --> 21:29.479
- He gave that to you.
- So what? It's fucking stupid.

21:29.560 --> 21:33.039
You shouldn't swear so much.
It's not good on a child.

21:33.120 --> 21:35.439
I'm not a child, you cock.

21:37.320 --> 21:39.679
Oh, shit.
We gotta kill 'em now.

21:39.760 --> 21:42.759
Just behave and don't swear.

21:47.280 --> 21:49.119
Hello there.

21:50.120 --> 21:52.879
Go fuck yourself, fuck-chops.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.199
Fucking tell me what to do.

22:00.680 --> 22:04.079
Go on, do it.
You lost your bottle. They saw us.

22:04.160 --> 22:07.039
You're wandering around to find
some fucking hut to show your daddy.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.239
- He can't even remember you.
- You should be quiet now.

22:09.320 --> 22:11.479
Why?
What you gonna do? Shoot me?

22:11.560 --> 22:14.359
I'm already dead, me.
Anyway, you can't kill your partner.

22:14.440 --> 22:16.519
- You are not my partner.
- Yes, I am.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.479
- I'm like you now.
- You are not like me.

22:18.560 --> 22:20.679
Stop saying that I am.

22:21.560 --> 22:24.319
Give me the gun. Give me the gun
and I'll go back and show you.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.279
Pietre?

22:36.360 --> 22:38.079
Pietre?

22:54.640 --> 22:58.519
There'll be no reception soon.
How will you find them?

22:58.600 --> 23:00.679
I'll figure it out.

23:00.760 --> 23:02.599
I imagine you will.

23:02.680 --> 23:07.279
The way you escaped was...
was incredible, Jessica.

23:09.280 --> 23:11.879
There's still time
to come with us.

23:17.960 --> 23:20.919
You don't seem to get
the dynamic here.

23:21.840 --> 23:25.679
You're tied,
I've a knife and a gun...

23:25.760 --> 23:29.719
- ... and I'm going to kill you.
- So, why am I still alive?

23:31.360 --> 23:33.759
Are you scared
he won't talk to you?

23:33.840 --> 23:36.799
Has it been on your mind?
The adjustment?

23:36.880 --> 23:41.079
Do you keep wondering
what it was he put inside you?

23:41.920 --> 23:46.799
Don't lose control of yourself, Jessica,
when you see your father.

23:46.880 --> 23:48.759
Your feelings...

23:57.080 --> 23:59.519
What if I lose control now?

23:59.600 --> 24:02.479
You think I'm scared
of being hurt?

24:03.520 --> 24:05.799
Why do you think
we did this?

24:06.360 --> 24:09.879
Philip was a genius
but we sacrificed everything for this.

24:09.960 --> 24:11.879
Including me?

24:11.960 --> 24:14.959
Your generation's
so self-absorbed.

24:15.840 --> 24:18.559
There'll be no statue
to Philip Carvel.

24:18.640 --> 24:21.319
No-one'll know his name.

24:21.400 --> 24:24.479
But we'll all survive
because of him.

24:24.560 --> 24:26.439
You won't.

24:28.520 --> 24:30.039
You won't survive.

24:39.960 --> 24:43.119
And I'm supposed to believe this?
Where's Milner?

24:43.200 --> 24:45.959
Wilson, you need to take them seriously.
What they're saying is...

24:46.040 --> 24:50.519
- Where is Milner?
- What, you gonna torture us, Wilson?

24:51.240 --> 24:52.599
Yeah.

24:52.680 --> 24:55.239
I might. I might do, Becky.

24:55.320 --> 24:58.159
Russian flu is real.

24:58.240 --> 25:01.359
It's some psychopathic
weaponised virus from the '60s...

25:01.440 --> 25:04.479
... and they're going to release it,
did you know that?

25:04.560 --> 25:07.879
- What? You did? You knew?
- We have a vaccine.

25:07.960 --> 25:10.319
But some will die,
won't they?

25:10.400 --> 25:13.559
How many, Wilson?
How many people will die?

25:13.640 --> 25:16.159
I tell you what.
Let's just get solar panels.

25:16.240 --> 25:18.999
Recycle our paper.
Let's just go to bottle banks.

25:19.080 --> 25:22.319
- You sound like Letts.
- Letts was right!

25:22.400 --> 25:25.399
Your problem is that you want
to think that the world is nice.

25:25.480 --> 25:28.559
That we can all just get along,
co-operate!

25:28.640 --> 25:30.199
When the fuck
have we ever done that?

25:30.280 --> 25:34.239
Wilson, Janus is not going
to do what you think.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.399
It's a form of eugenics.
The numbers...

25:36.480 --> 25:37.959
I'm here for Milner.

25:38.040 --> 25:40.399
I know she was with Jessica,
I know she was here...

25:40.480 --> 25:44.359
... and I know you know how to find her,
so I'll ask you again.

25:44.440 --> 25:46.559
- Where...
- Is Mr. Rabbit.

25:50.680 --> 25:52.239
Where is Mr. Rabbit?

26:02.520 --> 26:04.399
Leave us a moment.

26:06.760 --> 26:09.919
Why not let me
have a go, Wilson?

26:10.000 --> 26:12.879
I can be very effective.

26:12.960 --> 26:16.159
- You know that more than anyone.
- I said "leave us".

26:19.000 --> 26:21.519
Aye-aye, skipper.

26:27.560 --> 26:29.599
Jesus Christ, why did you say that?
If he heard you...

26:29.680 --> 26:32.799
My brother
was murdered yesterday.

26:32.880 --> 26:36.279
I'm not grieving, I'm not trying to get
in touch with my mum to see how she is.

26:36.360 --> 26:39.679
I'm not sitting and thinking
of all the good times.

26:39.760 --> 26:43.159
I'm here, trying to get in touch
with the people who murdered him.

26:43.240 --> 26:45.079
I'm here because of the numbers
on that drawing.

26:45.160 --> 26:48.319
So, you need
to fucking listen, Wilson!

26:53.920 --> 26:56.239
Okay. I've sent it to Leah.

26:56.320 --> 26:58.719
We'll wait.
But if that comes back as nothing...

26:58.800 --> 27:01.519
... you are going to tell me
how to find Milner.

27:01.600 --> 27:03.639
One way or another.

27:04.920 --> 27:06.919
Cock-face.

27:21.800 --> 27:24.279
Do you know who I am?

27:26.080 --> 27:28.039
You ask him.

27:30.800 --> 27:34.999
- Do you know who he is?
- No. Say "I".

27:42.400 --> 27:47.199
- Do you know who I am?
- Yes. You're my son. Pietre.

27:47.280 --> 27:49.959
No, let him touch you.

27:54.440 --> 27:58.199
- Why did you leave me?
- This is fucking creepy, mate.

27:58.280 --> 28:00.519
You weren't human.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.479
You were...

28:04.200 --> 28:06.039
... horrific.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.999
Where's Dad?

28:38.520 --> 28:40.879
It's good to see you again.

28:40.960 --> 28:43.159
I was worried about you.

28:44.760 --> 28:46.919
I missed you.

29:07.200 --> 29:09.839
I'm sorry
about your brother, Ian.

29:10.520 --> 29:12.759
You shouldn't blame yourself.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.719
I don't.

29:16.440 --> 29:18.479
I don't blame myself.

29:19.560 --> 29:22.799
I blame you,
you and your friends.

29:24.480 --> 29:27.679
At least you've lost someone now,
like me and Becky have.

29:27.760 --> 29:31.159
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

29:43.600 --> 29:46.639
I have to get
Jen and Alice out now.

29:46.720 --> 29:49.559
Milner said she'd kill them
if I didn't help her.

29:49.640 --> 29:51.799
If she comes back...

29:51.880 --> 29:54.039
... I need help.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.719
Please.

30:04.560 --> 30:06.199
So?

30:06.280 --> 30:08.119
That prove what we say?

30:08.200 --> 30:12.239
Er...yes. You are right.
It is exactly as you say.

30:12.320 --> 30:17.599
- The numbers show the adjustment.
- Great. So, you can stop it, right?

30:18.720 --> 30:21.359
What? What is it?

30:22.320 --> 30:25.119
They also show
something else.

30:25.200 --> 30:27.319
Something worse.

30:27.400 --> 30:29.279
Much, much worse.

30:29.360 --> 30:33.359
- How much fucking worse?
- We have to find Milner.

30:34.280 --> 30:36.439
We have to stop her now.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.839
Jessica.

30:46.880 --> 30:49.279
If he moves, shoot him.

30:49.360 --> 30:52.199
We're family.
There's no need for that.

30:52.280 --> 30:54.599
Aim for his chest.

31:29.520 --> 31:31.839
What you did to me....

31:31.920 --> 31:33.559
Jessica?

31:43.320 --> 31:44.879
You...

31:46.000 --> 31:48.879
- You know me?
- The eyes.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.719
I know the eyes.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.719
Don't touch me.

31:56.280 --> 31:59.559
Don't you fucking touch me.

31:59.640 --> 32:01.679
I love you.

32:06.480 --> 32:07.759
I love you.

32:23.480 --> 32:25.719
It was always like that.

32:25.800 --> 32:28.079
He only ever
had eyes for her.

32:29.120 --> 32:31.959
She ruined everything
for you and me.

32:39.080 --> 32:41.279
Do you want me to drive?

32:46.040 --> 32:48.559
We're doing things
our way now.

32:49.240 --> 32:51.839
You should have let us
bring people with us.

32:51.920 --> 32:53.919
They're dangerous.

33:10.840 --> 33:13.799
We've got to get you
out of here now.

33:13.880 --> 33:16.719
This, erm...
will give me your position.

33:16.800 --> 33:18.839
You'll have to take a panel off
one of the windows.

33:18.920 --> 33:21.119
I'm not sure which one.
I'll... I'll text you.

33:21.200 --> 33:24.079
It's on silent, but make sure
nobody hears the buzzer.

33:24.160 --> 33:26.839
Alice, can you, er...
make yourself sick?

33:26.920 --> 33:29.999
- I feel like vomiting all the time.
- Good girl.

33:43.880 --> 33:46.759
Right. They're in that building,
fourth floor.

33:46.840 --> 33:49.159
There's a window up there.
I think it's a bathroom.

33:49.240 --> 33:51.999
You get out that way
and you avoid all the security.

33:52.080 --> 33:53.839
I'll be waiting.

33:53.920 --> 33:57.759
And if no-one kills us,
then I think we should be fine.

33:58.360 --> 34:00.599
Thanks for doing this, Becky.

34:09.320 --> 34:10.799
Alice?

34:17.720 --> 34:20.439
- Shit.
- Jesus Christ, Michael!

34:20.520 --> 34:21.839
You first, Alice.

34:21.920 --> 34:24.679
I have a heights thing.
I-I can't do that. I just can't.

34:24.760 --> 34:28.079
You have a heights thing?
You... you never mentioned it before.

34:28.160 --> 34:31.039
- We've not been high up before.
- We...we went on the London Eye.

34:31.120 --> 34:34.159
- That was okay. It was an enclosed space.
- She has a fucking heights thing, Michael.

34:35.160 --> 34:37.439
You okay in there?

34:37.520 --> 34:40.319
- Yes!
- Right. Right.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.239
Okay, okay. Plan B.

34:46.880 --> 34:49.359
I think she's sick.
She's really sick.

34:49.440 --> 34:51.599
Can you call for a doctor?

34:51.680 --> 34:53.599
Okay.

34:53.680 --> 34:55.719
I'll call.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.559
Get up. Get up!

35:13.000 --> 35:16.279
Right. Right.
Right, give me...

35:16.360 --> 35:18.599
Here. Let's swap.
Go on, here.

35:18.680 --> 35:20.959
Right.
You give... give me the code...

35:21.040 --> 35:24.599
- ... or I'll kill you.
- I don't think you will.

35:24.680 --> 35:29.239
See, people like you,
you don't do this kind of stuff.

35:29.320 --> 35:30.519
It's not in you.

35:30.600 --> 35:32.479
See, I don't think...

35:34.560 --> 35:36.959
Give him the fucking code!

35:40.960 --> 35:44.079
- Hi, Becky.
- Hey, Alice. Lovely to see you.

35:44.160 --> 35:47.279
Scared of heights, then, eh?
That's a turn-up for the fucking books, innit?

35:47.360 --> 35:49.639
- You okay? Are you all right?
- Yeah. Go!

35:59.440 --> 36:03.679
He's not well.
I think things are coming back to him.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.359
But it's slow.

36:07.160 --> 36:10.479
- What's the adjustment?
- Ochii tăi.

36:10.560 --> 36:13.319
- Te rog! Te rog, nu...
- You're scaring him, Jessica.

36:13.400 --> 36:17.319
He speaks to Grant.
He thinks he's me.

36:22.640 --> 36:25.319
You can trust me.
You know that.

36:34.800 --> 36:39.239
You put Janus in me.
You did that to your own daughter.

36:39.320 --> 36:41.799
I did. I had to.

36:41.880 --> 36:44.159
- He says that...
- I know what he said, Grant.

36:44.240 --> 36:48.119
- I only wanted to protect you.
- Protect me?

36:49.360 --> 36:53.359
- You sterilised me.
- No. I saved you.

36:53.440 --> 36:57.399
I saved you, my darling.
Everything was to save you.

37:00.840 --> 37:02.759
Musai te zhav. Nashti...

37:02.840 --> 37:05.479
- What's going on? What is it?
- I don't know.

37:05.560 --> 37:09.039
- This is too much for him.
- Noi trebuie sa ne omoram!

37:09.120 --> 37:10.039
Philip!

37:10.120 --> 37:12.759
- Noi trebuie sa ne omoram!
- Philip!

37:12.840 --> 37:14.439
It's me.

37:19.160 --> 37:21.439
You haven't changed.

37:22.080 --> 37:26.799
- You haven't changed a bit, Milner.
- I have.

37:26.880 --> 37:29.799
Lots. And so have you.

37:31.440 --> 37:35.759
Let me speak to him alone, Jessica.
He doesn't know you. He'll talk to me.

37:35.840 --> 37:38.679
- No fucking way!
- Oh, Christ, Jessica!

37:38.760 --> 37:42.159
I'm tied. You've got guns and knives.
What can I do?

37:42.240 --> 37:44.999
We both need to find out
what he did to it.

37:45.080 --> 37:47.319
We both need to know.

37:57.480 --> 38:00.399
It's lovely to see you, Grant.

38:00.480 --> 38:03.599
You've grown.
How have you been?

38:07.160 --> 38:09.279
Did you miss Jessica?

38:09.360 --> 38:13.079
It's not easy caring for someone like her.
I know that.

38:13.680 --> 38:16.119
You turned me into a ghost.

38:21.120 --> 38:23.679
What if I did
the same to you?

38:23.760 --> 38:27.119
I don't think
that's the sort of person you are.

38:29.760 --> 38:33.119
I believe you were told
to give us some space.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.719
So, do you have a plan, then?

39:00.800 --> 39:01.759
Not really.

39:01.840 --> 39:06.319
I just thought I'd keep moving
and hope that something occurred.

39:06.880 --> 39:08.959
I didn't know it would be you.

39:09.040 --> 39:12.599
How did you find us?
There's no reception.

39:12.680 --> 39:17.359
I met an old couple down below,
said a boy swore at them.

39:18.560 --> 39:22.199
- He's a massive pain in the arse.
- He is.

39:23.960 --> 39:26.959
You've lost weight.
It's nice.

39:28.720 --> 39:31.319
Don't like that beard, though.

39:32.080 --> 39:35.839
You have everything in place?
All ready to go?

39:35.920 --> 39:38.839
Everything you planned,
it's all happening.

39:39.560 --> 39:42.599
What did you do to Janus,
Philip?

39:42.680 --> 39:46.439
I located a racial grouping
in Southeast Asia.

39:46.520 --> 39:49.239
Lower incidence of...
of cancer, heart disease.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.279
Violence... less.

39:51.360 --> 39:55.439
I felt... they were perfect.

39:56.200 --> 40:00.599
- And you chose them?
- I... I wanted to. I did.

40:00.680 --> 40:03.319
But at the very last moment...

40:03.400 --> 40:05.439
... I changed my mind.

40:06.640 --> 40:09.039
I chose my own.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.599
Roma.

40:12.520 --> 40:17.279
Roma are the people
that Janus will leave fertile.

40:20.480 --> 40:22.639
I chose, Milner.

40:22.720 --> 40:25.359
I'm so, so sorry.

40:28.680 --> 40:31.119
I said you were a god.

40:31.200 --> 40:32.999
And you were.

40:33.880 --> 40:36.119
Why shouldn't you choose?

40:36.200 --> 40:38.079
You're not angry?

40:39.960 --> 40:43.919
Do you remember
that beautiful separation we felt?

40:44.000 --> 40:47.519
The biggest secret in the world.
Just us.

40:48.080 --> 40:53.199
That feeling's never left,
and now I know I was always waiting.

40:53.280 --> 40:55.039
For what?

40:55.600 --> 40:57.399
For you.

40:58.120 --> 41:00.359
We're nearly there, Philip.

41:01.680 --> 41:04.799
We just have
one last thing to do.

41:26.040 --> 41:28.399
I have this for you.

41:32.160 --> 41:35.719
The person who did this
was very good.

41:49.640 --> 41:51.599
Run, Jessica!

41:51.680 --> 41:53.239
Please?

42:27.560 --> 42:29.839
Now it's just you and me.

42:45.360 --> 42:47.439
You'll be all right. Okay?

42:56.240 --> 42:58.719
Breathe! Breathe!

43:05.720 --> 43:07.479
Milner!

43:07.560 --> 43:10.559
Wilson, thank Christ it's you.

43:10.640 --> 43:13.239
I want you
to meet a great man.

43:13.320 --> 43:15.439
This is Philip Carvel.

43:16.640 --> 43:18.399
What? He's Philip Carvel?

43:19.360 --> 43:21.559
Have you given
the command yet?

43:21.640 --> 43:24.719
The command to release Russian flu.
Have you given it?

43:24.800 --> 43:27.879
- Yes, I have. Why?
- Christ. Oh, Jesus fucking...

43:27.960 --> 43:30.119
You have to reverse it.

43:30.680 --> 43:32.639
Janus isn't random.
He changed it.

43:32.720 --> 43:35.159
- Yes, I know.
- You know?

43:35.240 --> 43:38.159
I don't agree with
the adjustment he made, I don't...

43:38.240 --> 43:40.479
... but it's only going to cost a few
thousand lives and we will have...

43:40.560 --> 43:42.799
Is that what he told you?

43:44.040 --> 43:46.359
Tell her what you found out.

43:49.280 --> 43:53.319
- Janus stops the vaccine from working.
- No. No, no, no, that's not...

43:53.400 --> 43:56.799
Listen to me. The flu vaccine we have
is practically useless.

43:56.880 --> 43:58.639
He's right.

44:00.640 --> 44:03.839
I discovered that Janus
hijacks the vaccine.

44:03.920 --> 44:06.359
It attaches itself to it.

44:06.440 --> 44:10.199
So, it means that
when you're vaccinated...

44:10.280 --> 44:16.319
... the antibodies you create to fight the flu
are the wrong shape.

44:17.120 --> 44:19.039
They won't work.

44:19.120 --> 44:20.799
Unless...

44:22.280 --> 44:23.959
Unless?

44:24.040 --> 44:26.959
Unless you are Roma.

44:30.360 --> 44:33.999
The vaccine does
what Janus does.

44:34.080 --> 44:36.519
Only Roma will be protected.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.519
My love for Jessica
was like a physical thing...

44:42.600 --> 44:47.839
... an organ that didn't exist
until she was born...

44:49.120 --> 44:53.079
... and then
it controlled everything.

44:55.080 --> 44:57.319
You did this for her?

44:58.600 --> 45:02.199
- But we tested it. It worked...
- On Jessica. She's Roma.

45:02.280 --> 45:07.199
Whoever you called to release it,
you have to call him back.

45:07.280 --> 45:11.279
- Just a minute. Let... let me think.
- What's there to think about, Milner?

45:11.360 --> 45:13.319
Make the call.

45:20.080 --> 45:22.279
Dekendra Bilotti.

45:22.360 --> 45:26.039
Access XYL52721.

45:26.120 --> 45:27.759
Commence.

45:28.360 --> 45:30.039
What?

45:31.320 --> 45:33.439
But you said...

45:33.520 --> 45:35.239
... commence.

45:36.440 --> 45:39.279
- You hadn't called him?
- It's not what I wanted.

45:39.360 --> 45:42.039
Not at all. All those lives.

45:42.120 --> 45:44.239
- It is unfortunate.
- Unfortunate?

45:44.320 --> 45:47.079
The Russian flu vaccine
doesn't work.

45:47.160 --> 45:49.759
That's millions of lives.
Hundreds of millions, even.

45:49.840 --> 45:53.519
And there are seven billion
on this planet.

45:53.600 --> 45:56.399
100 million
won't even make a dent.

45:56.480 --> 45:58.839
We're trying to save the species.

45:58.920 --> 46:01.639
If it costs a few million individuals,
isn't that okay?

46:01.720 --> 46:04.759
It's not fucking okay!
Call back!

46:04.840 --> 46:07.159
Call him back now!
Stop him!

46:08.120 --> 46:10.679
I told you to call him back.

46:11.680 --> 46:13.879
You can't shoot me.

46:13.960 --> 46:17.119
I'm the only one
who knows who he is.

46:21.440 --> 46:23.559
No, no, it's fine.

46:23.640 --> 46:25.639
I understand.

46:26.600 --> 46:29.359
I understand completely.

46:39.360 --> 46:41.119
Throw the gun.

46:43.840 --> 46:45.839
Get on your knees. Now!

46:49.000 --> 46:50.999
It's easy, this.
You're next, mate.

46:53.720 --> 46:56.559
- Grant, don't! Don't. Please?
- Why?

46:56.640 --> 46:58.439
Why not you as well?

46:58.520 --> 47:01.639
Because... I'm asking you.

47:01.720 --> 47:03.439
Please.

47:17.600 --> 47:19.799
- Fuck.
- It's all right.

47:19.880 --> 47:22.239
What have I done?

47:24.920 --> 47:27.279
No, no, no, no, no.

47:27.360 --> 47:29.559
It's wrong...

47:36.960 --> 47:38.439
Hey!

47:40.320 --> 47:42.439
Hey, you! I'm talking to you.

47:43.160 --> 47:45.639
You can't take a call,
not when you're serving.

47:45.720 --> 47:47.759
Who the fuck are you,
taking a call when...?

47:47.840 --> 47:50.439
And who the fuck
do you think you...?

48:04.520 --> 48:06.519
Hey! I'm talking to you!

48:07.440 --> 48:10.519
Who the fuck are ya?
Eh? Who the fuck are ya?
