WEBVTT

00:04.787 --> 00:06.745
- I think you killed my father.

00:07.833 --> 00:09.233
- Give me an hour
to get to O'Hare.

00:09.574 --> 00:10.508
You'll never see me again. - No.

00:10.532 --> 00:11.857
- We could have been so happy.

00:11.881 --> 00:13.641
- No! No, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

00:13.665 --> 00:14.773
I need help in here!

00:14.797 --> 00:16.601
I'm leaving Med.

00:16.625 --> 00:18.864
I'm never gonna be able to
get past what happened here.

00:18.888 --> 00:21.432
I need a fresh start.

00:21.456 --> 00:23.173
- I heard Dr. Manning
was in an accident?

00:23.197 --> 00:24.609
- Dr. Marcel. - Who are you?

00:24.633 --> 00:26.263
- I'm her fiancÃ©.

00:26.287 --> 00:28.656
- I'm so sorry, Natalie.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.180
- What are you doing here?

00:30.204 --> 00:31.572
I don't want you coming
around here again.

00:31.596 --> 00:33.705
We're getting married. - What?

00:33.729 --> 00:35.707
- I don't remember you
asking me to marry you.

00:35.731 --> 00:36.708
- You will.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.710
- They found a mass.

00:38.734 --> 00:40.886
Metastatic adenocarcinoma.

00:40.910 --> 00:42.496
I don't want anyone to know.

00:42.520 --> 00:45.523
I don't want to be
the sick person.

00:52.791 --> 00:55.422
- God, when is it gonna stop?

00:55.446 --> 00:58.904
- Hey, um, I'm sorry...
I think it's empty?

00:58.928 --> 01:01.061
- Oh, hold on. I need
to get you unhooked.

01:03.411 --> 01:05.215
- I just don't wanna
be late for work.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.608
- Work? You just
got a bag of chemo.

01:07.632 --> 01:10.350
You need to go home
and get some rest.

01:10.374 --> 01:11.917
- Uh-uh.

01:11.941 --> 01:14.224
It's my friend's first
day back after an injury.

01:14.248 --> 01:16.313
And besides, I
have an E.D. to run.

01:16.337 --> 01:17.618
- At Med? - Yeah.

01:17.642 --> 01:19.533
- They have a
huge infusion center.

01:19.557 --> 01:21.622
You don't have to come
all the way over here.

01:21.646 --> 01:24.364
- I like to keep
things separate.

01:24.388 --> 01:27.280
And besides, I love what
you're doing with the doughnuts.

01:27.304 --> 01:30.544
- Careful if you're
driving. Roads are a mess.

01:30.568 --> 01:33.243
- Yeah, thanks.

01:33.267 --> 01:35.636
- Third year of med school
will not only be the most difficult

01:35.660 --> 01:37.769
of your lives, but also
the most important.

01:37.793 --> 01:39.379
Anyone know how many patients

01:39.403 --> 01:40.685
come through our
E.D. in a single year?

01:40.709 --> 01:43.557
- 105,000.18,000 acute

01:43.581 --> 01:45.864
and 4,600 active traumas.

01:45.888 --> 01:47.779
- That's right.

01:47.803 --> 01:49.824
You thinking about
going into E.D. med?

01:49.848 --> 01:52.479
- Is there anything else?

01:52.503 --> 01:54.829
- Anyway, for each of you,

01:54.853 --> 01:57.223
the E.D. will be both a
challenge and an opportunity

01:57.247 --> 01:59.312
to sharpen your skills.

01:59.336 --> 02:01.619
- He loves giving this
lecture, doesn't he?

02:01.643 --> 02:02.968
- He's the only
one who volunteers.

02:02.992 --> 02:04.646
Every single year.

02:09.258 --> 02:11.629
- Oh, I'm sorry, I
thought I had a patient.

02:11.653 --> 02:12.717
- Huh?

02:12.741 --> 02:14.632
- Are you okay?

02:14.656 --> 02:16.982
- Yeah, I just got
shanghaied onto the day shift.

02:17.006 --> 02:18.766
Late night, so a
little pick-me-up...

02:18.790 --> 02:22.446
Crockett Marcel.
Fourth year, surgery.

02:23.578 --> 02:25.425
- Noah Sexton.

02:25.449 --> 02:26.861
- Nice to meet you, Noah Sexton.

02:26.885 --> 02:29.429
You mind? - Sure.

02:29.453 --> 02:32.389
- Team work.

02:32.413 --> 02:34.739
So, future E.D. doc, I presume?

02:34.763 --> 02:38.830
- No. I mean, yes, but, uh...

02:38.854 --> 02:42.399
well, my real plan is to
open some urgent cares

02:42.423 --> 02:44.966
after residency and
try to grow the brand.

02:44.990 --> 02:46.838
Maybe take it public.

02:46.862 --> 02:48.492
- Sounds ambitious.

02:48.516 --> 02:50.537
Then again...

02:50.561 --> 02:52.583
I don't even know
how you folks manage

02:52.607 --> 02:54.628
to start so soon
after last call.

02:54.652 --> 02:58.352
Hmm... Well, see you around.

03:01.572 --> 03:04.725
- Oh-ho-ho. First day of school.

03:04.749 --> 03:07.293
Dang, how long we
been doing this for?

03:07.317 --> 03:10.035
- Long enough you should
know to get a better umbrella.

03:10.059 --> 03:11.863
- Are you aware
that in some cultures,

03:11.887 --> 03:14.518
a downpour is
considered very good luck?

03:14.542 --> 03:17.303
- Really? In which cultures?

03:17.327 --> 03:20.480
- I don't know...
dry places? Yemen.

03:20.504 --> 03:24.484
- Ooh, the power
must've gone out.

03:24.508 --> 03:28.358
The backup
generator's kicking in.

03:28.382 --> 03:29.707
I better go talk to engineering.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.274
I'll see you later.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.971
- See you.

03:32.995 --> 03:35.016
- We must not be moving
patients fast enough

03:35.040 --> 03:36.583
if they had time
to deliver these.

03:36.607 --> 03:38.368
Nice.

03:38.392 --> 03:40.500
- Actually, they're for Natalie.

03:40.524 --> 03:42.439
They're from Phillip.

03:44.746 --> 03:46.898
It's her first day back and all.

03:46.922 --> 03:48.837
- Oh.

03:50.795 --> 03:53.078
Well, I'm sure they'll look
great on her kitchen table.

03:53.102 --> 03:55.409
- Yeah.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.608
- Doctor Choi! An
ambulance skidded out

04:01.632 --> 04:02.914
a couple blocks
away. They need help.

04:02.938 --> 04:04.785
- I'm on it. - Me too.

04:04.809 --> 04:07.614
- You in? - Yeah.

04:07.638 --> 04:10.008
- Hey, Capp, anybody hurt?

04:10.032 --> 04:13.751
- Driver here is okay, but
the ambo... patient's stable.

04:13.775 --> 04:16.101
Older guy with chest pain,
but the paramedic got it bad.

04:16.125 --> 04:18.954
- He's still in there?
- We're getting him out now.

04:40.410 --> 04:43.346
Hang on.

04:43.370 --> 04:46.634
Ahh, please!
- All right, nice and easy.

04:53.815 --> 04:55.445
- Ready?

04:55.469 --> 04:58.472
One, two, three. - We got him.

05:00.517 --> 05:02.800
- Darren... Darren,
what happened?

05:02.824 --> 05:05.672
- I smashed my hip.

05:05.696 --> 05:08.371
- One to ten... how's the pain?
- Oh, man, it's a ten.

05:08.395 --> 05:09.937
- He's tachycardic
and his pulse is thready.

05:09.961 --> 05:12.418
- You think it's broken?

05:12.442 --> 05:14.464
- We gotta go.
Let's go, let's go.

05:14.488 --> 05:17.380
Hang in there, Darren.
We're getting you to Med.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.773
Darren? Darren.

05:19.797 --> 05:20.992
- What's happening?
- He's bleeding out

05:21.016 --> 05:22.820
into his pelvis. We gotta go.

05:22.844 --> 05:25.562
- Easy, easy.
- This is Mr. Lentz.

05:25.586 --> 05:29.087
- Mr. Lentz, what's going on?

05:29.111 --> 05:32.593
Pain in my chest.
- It's all right, we got you.

05:34.203 --> 05:36.442
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

05:36.466 --> 05:37.487
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

05:37.511 --> 05:40.688
- Yeah. - Let's go!

05:49.653 --> 05:52.221
- Baghdad.
- Pressure in two units

05:53.309 --> 05:54.589
O-positive, get a pelvic binder,

05:55.485 --> 05:56.723
then activate the MTP.
Tachycardic and hypotensive.

05:56.747 --> 05:56.834
Steve, what's your plan?
- Bind his pelvis.

05:57.748 --> 05:58.923
Get x-rays and CT to confirm,

06:00.447 --> 06:01.946
then interventional radiology
to embolize the bleeders.

06:01.970 --> 06:03.991
- Good. Let's
transfer on my count.

06:04.015 --> 06:05.950
Everybody ready? - Yeah.

06:05.974 --> 06:08.039
- One, two, three.

06:08.063 --> 06:10.346
Trauma labs, ABG,
chest and pelvic x-ray.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.652
- Pelvic binder.
Blood's on the way.

06:12.676 --> 06:14.219
- Okay, let's get ready to roll.

06:14.243 --> 06:17.048
Roll.

06:17.072 --> 06:18.354
- Tell me as soon
as you get the scans.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.267
I'll let IR know
we're coming up.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.337
- Okay.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.427
- Bagged.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.454
Okay, he's good.
Bolus a liter of saline.

06:31.478 --> 06:33.194
I think we're gonna
be in good shape.

06:33.218 --> 06:34.631
- Hold on, let me get
you guys some dry scrubs.

06:34.655 --> 06:36.613
- No, no, no. We're fine.

06:57.242 --> 06:59.482
- Aww.

06:59.506 --> 07:03.311
- Look who decided to show
up. Must be good to be back.

07:03.335 --> 07:04.574
Much better than

07:04.598 --> 07:06.227
sitting around at home. - I bet.

07:06.251 --> 07:08.055
How's Phillip?

07:08.079 --> 07:09.666
- Oh, Phillip's... great.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.319
You know, he's been
really helping out with Owen,

07:11.343 --> 07:14.235
giving me time to heal and rest.

07:14.259 --> 07:16.063
- But?

07:16.087 --> 07:17.238
- But what?

07:17.262 --> 07:20.372
- Nat...

07:20.396 --> 07:23.419
- Doctor Abrams said that
I would have memory loss

07:23.443 --> 07:27.031
and that the loss might
include some... feelings.

07:27.055 --> 07:29.250
I don't know. I
guess I'm just excited

07:29.274 --> 07:30.643
for them to come back.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.732
- Yeah. - Yeah.

07:32.756 --> 07:35.431
Anyway, how are you?
How was your vacation?

07:35.455 --> 07:37.345
- Oh, it was just fine.

07:37.369 --> 07:40.479
You know, just a little
me time to recharge.

07:40.503 --> 07:43.482
- Natalie, it's good
to see you well.

07:43.506 --> 07:45.397
- Thanks, Jim.
- Four weeks, though...

07:45.421 --> 07:46.529
Seems a little soon
to come back from

07:46.553 --> 07:48.095
a traumatic brain injury.

07:48.119 --> 07:50.402
- Well, Doctor
Abrams did clear me.

07:50.426 --> 07:52.448
- Well, Sam likes to get
patients off his service.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.580
Let's do a half shift
today. H&Ps only.

07:54.604 --> 07:57.104
Probably best just
to, uh, ease back in.

07:57.128 --> 07:59.304
- No... I don't think
that's necessary.

08:00.784 --> 08:04.068
- Doesn't look too bad.
70% stenosis in two vessels.

08:04.092 --> 08:05.678
He's stable from the nitro,

08:05.702 --> 08:07.767
so I think we can
treat conservatively.

08:07.791 --> 08:10.596
- Spoken like a true
future urgent care mogul.

08:10.620 --> 08:13.207
See? I listen.

08:13.231 --> 08:16.080
Mr. Lentz, no injuries
from the ambo crash, I hear.

08:16.104 --> 08:17.603
I've gone over your cath,
and I'd like to schedule you

08:17.627 --> 08:19.562
for coronary artery
bypass surgery.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.259
Preferably today.

08:21.283 --> 08:25.655
- But Dr. Marcel, the
medicine... worked.

08:25.679 --> 08:27.613
I-I feel fine.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.180
- I understand,
but you did suffer

08:29.204 --> 08:30.573
a heart attack this morning.

08:30.597 --> 08:32.357
I'd like to prevent you
from having another.

08:33.643 --> 08:36.143
- There must be other ways.
- We could talk about

08:36.167 --> 08:38.537
other medical options
or possibly revisit

08:38.561 --> 08:40.496
a stent down the road...

08:40.520 --> 08:43.323
- None of which, in my
opinion, will solve the problem.

08:43.347 --> 08:46.502
Now, I know this is not
what you were expecting...

08:46.526 --> 08:48.504
- Doctor Marcel...
- But I do ask that you

08:48.528 --> 08:52.072
trust me when I say that you
might be one cheeseburger away

08:52.096 --> 08:53.465
from a far worse
event than the one

08:53.489 --> 08:56.144
you experienced this morning.

08:58.755 --> 09:01.802
You... you really think so?
- Yes, I do.

09:06.371 --> 09:11.527
Well... if... if you say so.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.138
Okay. - Good.

09:14.162 --> 09:17.228
I'll talk to Doctor Latham,
chief of CT surgery,

09:17.252 --> 09:19.036
and I'll get back to
you with those details.

09:22.779 --> 09:25.628
Doctor Sexton? - Yeah, um...

09:25.652 --> 09:28.848
You kind of gave him a
hard sell on the surgery.

09:28.872 --> 09:31.590
We should really
give him all his options.

09:31.614 --> 09:33.853
- Hold on.

09:33.877 --> 09:36.856
70% stenosis on a cath
means a 95% blockage

09:36.880 --> 09:40.164
in three dimensions.
Coupled with a decreased LVF,

09:40.188 --> 09:43.757
I'd say his only other
option right now is dying.

09:47.238 --> 09:51.175
Why don't you come
up and observe?

09:51.199 --> 09:52.722
Might be illuminating.

09:54.681 --> 09:57.684
Yeah, Doctor Latham?

10:00.382 --> 10:02.490
- Hi, Lacey, I'm
Doctor Halstead.

10:02.514 --> 10:04.188
This is student doctor Curry.

10:04.212 --> 10:05.711
I hear you had a
seizure at school today?

10:05.735 --> 10:07.452
- Yeah, in the
middle of calculus.

10:07.476 --> 10:08.540
- Has that ever happened before?

10:08.564 --> 10:09.696
- No.

10:10.697 --> 10:13.284
- Any idea what caused it?

10:13.308 --> 10:15.547
- Maybe the giant
gas leak in our school.

10:15.571 --> 10:17.244
- We've been
smelling it for weeks.

10:17.268 --> 10:19.333
- And no one's fixed it?
- No... and I've been

10:19.357 --> 10:21.335
getting dizzy and nauseous

10:21.359 --> 10:22.639
and now I can't stop doing this.

10:24.406 --> 10:26.732
- The soccer state
finals are tomorrow.

10:26.756 --> 10:28.778
- Yeah, is she gonna be okay?

10:28.802 --> 10:30.736
- The arm motions...
when did those start?

10:30.760 --> 10:32.695
- Today, after the seizure.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.740
- Hmm, okay.

10:34.764 --> 10:36.612
Have either of you
had any symptoms?

10:36.636 --> 10:38.483
- No. - Nothing.

10:38.507 --> 10:41.355
- Uh, do you have any history
of head injuries or trauma?

10:41.379 --> 10:43.793
- No. It... it's a gas leak.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.621
Can't you just test the air
or my blood or something?

10:45.645 --> 10:47.274
- That's exactly
what we're gonna do.

10:47.298 --> 10:48.754
Let me run some tests
and talk to your school,

10:48.778 --> 10:50.843
while Ms. Curry does
a quick neuro exam.

10:50.867 --> 10:53.411
- I need to get better.
- Understood.

10:53.435 --> 10:55.350
We're gonna take
good care of you.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.460
Hey, we didn't have
a nurse in there.

10:59.484 --> 11:01.593
Could you get someone
to draw up a CBC, CMP,

11:01.617 --> 11:02.855
and start her on IV and fluids?

11:02.879 --> 11:04.489
- I got it.

11:12.323 --> 11:14.475
- Hey. - Hey.

11:14.499 --> 11:17.261
- Welcome back. - Thanks.

11:17.285 --> 11:20.481
Go away for a few weeks
and everything's different.

11:20.505 --> 11:22.875
Connor's left... and Ava?

11:22.899 --> 11:25.312
Oh, my God.

11:25.336 --> 11:26.976
- Yeah, that was,
uh... a horrible shock.

11:28.644 --> 11:30.796
- You look good.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.755
I mean, you healed...
you healed up well.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.844
- Yeah.

11:34.868 --> 11:37.281
- And the concussion?

11:37.305 --> 11:38.804
- I'm taking it slowly.

11:38.828 --> 11:41.178
- Sure.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.835
Glad to have you back.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.796
- Hey... hey, Will?

11:51.754 --> 11:53.776
- Yeah?

11:53.800 --> 11:55.889
- I'm sorry you had to
find out the way you did.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.696
About me and Phillip
getting engaged.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.829
But I guess that's what I was
coming to your car to tell you.

12:03.853 --> 12:06.005
- Right.

12:06.029 --> 12:09.554
- I mean, I don't remember
a lot from that day, but...

12:11.556 --> 12:14.516
It makes sense.

12:15.909 --> 12:18.017
- I got a kid with
a gunshot wound!

12:18.041 --> 12:20.716
- T-1. Doctor Lanik.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.327
- Taylor Holmes, 16, shot
once through the right forearm

12:23.351 --> 12:26.025
and into the flank. BP
103/60, heart rate 95.

12:26.049 --> 12:30.551
- They shot me.
Somebody shot me.

12:30.575 --> 12:32.795
- All right, let's move
him. One, two, three.

12:35.493 --> 12:37.428
So what happened out there?
- I don't know.

12:37.452 --> 12:39.952
I was just waiting for
the bus. Am I in trouble?

12:39.976 --> 12:41.867
- There's no law
against getting shot.

12:41.891 --> 12:43.913
- Active bleeding
from his flank.

12:43.937 --> 12:45.741
Let's get some
four-by-four dressings.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.873
- That's okay, I got this.

12:47.897 --> 12:50.833
Does it hurt anywhere else?
- Uh-uh.

12:50.857 --> 12:53.879
Can somebody call my mom?
- Don't worry, we will.

12:53.903 --> 12:56.577
- Okay, got the brachial.
Hemostat times two.

12:56.601 --> 12:57.840
- I'll apply pressure.
Get me some suction.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.798
- We're fine. Doris?

12:59.822 --> 13:01.432
- Hemostat.

13:08.613 --> 13:10.417
- See? Easy-peasy.

13:10.441 --> 13:12.071
Your artery's clamped,
but your flank wound is

13:12.095 --> 13:13.769
still bleeding, so we
gotta get you up to surgery.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.509
- I need an operation?
- Yes, you do.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.076
It'll fix you up.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.512
- Doctor Manning will take
you right up in a minute.

13:18.536 --> 13:19.687
- You want me to transfer him?

13:19.711 --> 13:20.887
- And write the note, thanks.

13:24.107 --> 13:25.848
- All right, let's move.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.944
- I'll take it from here.

13:37.773 --> 13:40.839
- Hey, where you going?

13:40.863 --> 13:42.406
- Lanik's having me do transpo.

13:42.430 --> 13:44.495
- Are you serious?

13:44.519 --> 13:46.627
- Anything to keep me
from practicing medicine.

13:46.651 --> 13:48.716
- Huh... well, welcome
back, Doctor Manning.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.525
- Thanks.

13:55.486 --> 13:58.639
- Any word on when Doctor
Latham's coming back in?

13:58.663 --> 14:00.511
- He's still stuck in O.R. 12.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.600
- Some suction, please.

14:02.624 --> 14:04.384
All right, then.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.822
Let's suture.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.694
- My first day,

14:09.718 --> 14:12.131
I'm taking this woman's
history out in the chairs,

14:12.155 --> 14:16.135
when I feel this warm liquid
all over my leg and I'm like,

14:16.159 --> 14:18.834
did she just pee on
me? But I keep going until

14:18.858 --> 14:22.402
she says, "When are you
gonna ask about my baby?"

14:22.426 --> 14:24.578
And I realize that
her water just broke,

14:24.602 --> 14:27.712
but before I can say
anything, she passes out cold

14:27.736 --> 14:30.652
'cause now she's in a
total eclamptic crisis.

14:31.958 --> 14:34.023
- What... what happened?

14:34.047 --> 14:35.807
- Whoa.

14:35.831 --> 14:38.549
Everybody freeze.

14:38.573 --> 14:41.552
- Power must've gone out.
Those are the emergency lights,

14:41.576 --> 14:44.163
but the backup generator
should kick in any second.

14:44.187 --> 14:46.513
- Where we at? - I got nothing.

14:46.537 --> 14:48.515
- Suction's out.
- Bypass is on battery.

14:48.539 --> 14:50.082
Not sure how long we got.

14:50.106 --> 14:51.910
- Okay, I'm sure
somebody's working on this.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.781
Be ready to
hand-crank the bypass.

14:53.805 --> 14:55.653
You're keeping him under.

14:55.677 --> 14:57.176
Can somebody get us some lights?

14:57.200 --> 14:59.700
- We're stopped. How
come we're stopped?

14:59.724 --> 15:01.988
- I don't know.

15:05.643 --> 15:07.708
Hello?

15:07.732 --> 15:10.189
Is anyone out there?

15:10.213 --> 15:11.911
Hello?

15:16.524 --> 15:18.352
- The whole hospital is gone.

15:19.483 --> 15:20.843
Lights, computers,
imaging, Pyxis.

15:21.398 --> 15:21.442
- What happened to
the backup generator?

15:22.225 --> 15:23.225
- It's totally flooded.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.165
It's gonna take a few
hours to get back on.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.320
- Automatic locks will be
shut, elevators jammed.

15:28.579 --> 15:28.623
We'll do a sweep to see if
we can find anyone in trouble.

15:29.493 --> 15:30.493
- Thank you. - All right.

15:31.713 --> 15:32.864
- Mags, where are we going?
- All bets are off.

15:32.888 --> 15:34.126
Take the Hybrid O.R.

15:34.150 --> 15:37.501
Here, you take this.

15:39.025 --> 15:41.984
- Okay, let's get
ready to transfer.

15:44.508 --> 15:47.555
Everybody ready?
Yeah, one, two, three.

15:48.643 --> 15:51.535
Mo, change to a pressure bag,
then send for four more units.

15:51.559 --> 15:53.232
- You think he's
still losing blood?

15:53.256 --> 15:55.017
- We're gonna find out now.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.583
You ever check abdominal
pressure with a Foley?

15:56.607 --> 15:58.498
- I've read about it.
- It's old-school.

15:58.522 --> 16:00.239
Just put a catheter on the bag,

16:00.263 --> 16:01.501
then add a transducer
with a three-way tap.

16:01.525 --> 16:03.155
- Okay. - Doctor Choi,

16:03.179 --> 16:05.375
April, they need you in 3.
- Okay.

16:05.399 --> 16:07.029
Hook it up to the
a-line transducer,

16:07.053 --> 16:08.378
then watch the waveform.
If it gets above 30,

16:08.402 --> 16:10.510
come and get me. - Okay.

16:10.534 --> 16:12.686
- Let me help you with that.

16:12.710 --> 16:16.255
- April, I think they need all
the help they can get out here.

16:16.279 --> 16:18.605
Steve, you good? - Yeah.

16:18.629 --> 16:19.979
Yeah, I'm good.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.354
- See, the water's coming
in here from the edge.

16:28.378 --> 16:31.662
- So the backup generator is
located below a storm drain?

16:31.686 --> 16:33.055
Are you serious?

16:33.079 --> 16:35.231
- Don't ask me.
- Don't ask you...

16:35.255 --> 16:37.276
Look, you've gotta get
this thing up and running.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.017
Get as many men as you need.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.063
- It's still gonna take all day.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.282
Northern Illinois Power
will get a spare out to us.

16:43.306 --> 16:45.197
- Oh, this is ridiculous.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.417
What is their ETA?

16:47.441 --> 16:49.201
- Two hours?

16:49.225 --> 16:50.463
We'll have to send our
critical care patients out.

16:50.487 --> 16:52.335
- We can't. Lakeshore Memorial's

16:52.359 --> 16:54.076
already on bypass.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.730
East Mercy's taking
all the overflow.

16:56.754 --> 16:58.994
- So we have to keep
1,000 sick and dying patients

16:59.018 --> 17:01.257
alive with no lights, no
medicine, no nothing?

17:01.281 --> 17:03.694
- Well, we'll do the best we
can and, Maggie, pace yourself.

17:03.718 --> 17:05.459
Today's gonna be a marathon.

17:09.767 --> 17:12.640
- Stop cardioplegia and
prepare to come off bypass.

17:18.340 --> 17:20.430
Okay. Removing cross-clamp.

17:28.263 --> 17:30.112
He's not getting enough
flow to his left anterior wall.

17:30.136 --> 17:31.548
Can you up his output?

17:31.572 --> 17:33.487
- Not enough to matter.

17:36.446 --> 17:38.424
Then we'll have
to continue surgery.

17:38.448 --> 17:40.426
- We can't arrest him again.

17:40.450 --> 17:42.017
He'll never come off the bypass.

17:44.193 --> 17:47.738
- Fine. Then we'll
do it off pump.

17:47.762 --> 17:51.524
- But you can't sew a
vessel into a beating heart.

17:51.548 --> 17:54.136
That's almost impossible
even with electricity.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.553
- Graft is down. We
don't have a choice.

17:58.164 --> 18:02.231
- But a-a bad anastomosis
and he'll clot off.

18:02.255 --> 18:04.276
It'll kill him.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.757
- Well, then we'll just
have to do a good one.

18:06.781 --> 18:10.239
Speaking of which, do
me a favor and scrub in.

18:10.263 --> 18:12.091
I could use the extra hands.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.662
- Man, I know it's hot in
here, but I'm kind of freezing.

18:25.669 --> 18:29.475
- Here.
- Hey, anybody down there?

18:29.499 --> 18:32.285
- Yes, hello! I've
got a patient in here.

18:34.852 --> 18:37.203
Here, hang on.
Someone's coming, okay?

18:39.205 --> 18:42.184
- Natalie, what do we got?

18:42.208 --> 18:44.316
- He's losing blood. We
need to get him to surgery.

18:44.340 --> 18:46.318
- All right, sit him up.

18:46.342 --> 18:48.039
I'll get a sked down
to bring him out.

18:50.216 --> 18:52.435
- Whoa, that... that
doesn't feel so good.

18:54.350 --> 18:55.762
- What's wrong?

18:55.786 --> 18:57.634
- He can't maintain
pressure sitting up.

18:57.658 --> 18:59.331
- Can he stay up long
enough to pull him out?

18:59.355 --> 19:03.205
- Taylor? Taylor. No,
it's not gonna happen.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.207
Get me four units of
uncrossmatched blood.

19:05.231 --> 19:07.122
I need to stabilize
him before I...

19:07.146 --> 19:09.646
- Hey, you okay?

19:09.670 --> 19:12.847
- Yeah, Matt, I'm fine.

19:16.546 --> 19:19.395
What... what happened?
- You blacked out for a minute,

19:19.419 --> 19:21.788
but we're gonna get
you some blood, okay?

19:21.812 --> 19:23.225
- All right. I'll get that blood

19:23.249 --> 19:24.617
to you as soon as I can.

19:24.641 --> 19:27.688
- Thank you. Just
hang in there, okay?

19:37.785 --> 19:40.242
- Why is this happening?

19:40.266 --> 19:42.200
Finally, a doctor.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.246
Have you figured
out what's going on?

19:44.270 --> 19:46.378
- No, the lab went down before
they could run Lacey's blood.

19:46.402 --> 19:48.250
- What kind of a
hospital is this?

19:48.274 --> 19:49.729
- Mom...

19:49.753 --> 19:51.688
- I apologize for
the circumstances.

19:51.712 --> 19:54.430
We're trying to remedy it.
- So what do we do next?

19:54.454 --> 19:56.562
- Unfortunately,
we can't do much.

19:56.586 --> 19:58.738
I've called neurology, but
it... it's gonna be a long wait.

19:58.762 --> 20:00.566
- It's just a gas leak.

20:00.590 --> 20:02.394
Please, just give me some
medicine or something.

20:02.418 --> 20:04.527
- Treatment for
inhalation is supportive.

20:04.551 --> 20:06.268
The symptoms... they
have to wear off over time.

20:06.292 --> 20:08.270
- She doesn't have time.

20:08.294 --> 20:09.575
She needs to get
to soccer practice.

20:09.599 --> 20:11.447
- Yeah, the finals are tomorrow.

20:11.471 --> 20:13.710
- I gotta be honest.
Given what I'm seeing,

20:13.734 --> 20:15.755
I'm not optimistic about
you playing in that game.

20:15.779 --> 20:17.409
- What? - You can't do that.

20:17.433 --> 20:18.758
It's the state finals.
- We need her!

20:18.782 --> 20:21.326
- Doctor Halstead,
I have to play.

20:21.350 --> 20:25.243
Everyone's counting on me
and I've been working so hard.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.288
I can't let them down now.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.638
I can't.

20:28.662 --> 20:30.596
- You need to figure this out.
- I hear you.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.337
We are doing our best.

20:32.361 --> 20:34.774
Just try to take it easy,

20:34.798 --> 20:38.213
relax, and let us
take care of you.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.910
I'm gonna find out what's
going on with the power

20:39.934 --> 20:42.676
and hopefully we'll have
some answers soon.

20:46.941 --> 20:49.702
- We're low on fluids.
Only if they need them.

20:49.726 --> 20:52.227
- Mags, any word
on the new genny?

20:52.251 --> 20:55.317
- Still uptown, not
even on the truck yet.

20:55.341 --> 20:57.493
- Be nice to get the
air back up, huh?

20:57.517 --> 21:00.626
- Yeah... I'm
frying like an egg.

21:00.650 --> 21:02.435
- Doctor Choi. It's Darren.

21:06.003 --> 21:07.831
The waveform broke 30.

21:11.879 --> 21:13.813
- Airway pressure's too
high. Give me a scalpel.

21:13.837 --> 21:15.511
- What's this for?

21:15.535 --> 21:16.990
- Abdominal
compartment syndrome.

21:17.014 --> 21:19.645
- Wait, you think
that's all blood in there?

21:19.669 --> 21:21.473
- Pelvic hematoma
must've ruptured.

21:21.497 --> 21:22.735
The pressure's so high,
he's not getting any blood

21:22.759 --> 21:24.607
back to his heart.

21:24.631 --> 21:25.825
- But if we can't get
him upstairs to the O.R.,

21:25.849 --> 21:27.547
how are we gonna
take care of him?

21:29.375 --> 21:31.464
Oh, my God.

21:34.554 --> 21:35.879
- All right.

21:35.903 --> 21:37.687
Let's pack him.

21:41.822 --> 21:45.715
Hey... hey, Steve. Look at me.

21:45.739 --> 21:46.846
Two more minutes,
he would've died.

21:46.870 --> 21:49.501
You saved his life.

21:49.525 --> 21:50.981
Now come on.

21:51.005 --> 21:53.205
Let's pack him up and build
a bag for those intestines.

21:54.922 --> 21:57.228
- Okay. Okay.

22:02.625 --> 22:05.430
- All right, thanks.

22:05.454 --> 22:09.042
- Will, your patient
with the tics.

22:09.066 --> 22:11.393
- Yeah.
- What... what are you thinking?

22:11.417 --> 22:14.526
- Good question. Uh,
the fire department

22:14.550 --> 22:15.745
just told me the school's clean,

22:15.769 --> 22:17.616
so that rules out gas leak.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.662
- She seems pretty anxious.

22:19.686 --> 22:21.533
You mind if I pop in and say hi?

22:21.557 --> 22:23.666
- Yeah, sure. I don't
know if we're gonna get

22:23.690 --> 22:25.929
any real answers till
neuro gets here, but...

22:25.953 --> 22:27.713
- Doctor Halstead! - It's okay.

22:27.737 --> 22:30.673
- What's happening?
- Help me get her on her side.

22:30.697 --> 22:32.414
- She's seizing!

22:32.438 --> 22:35.068
Two milligrams ativan IM.

22:35.092 --> 22:37.680
- You got it.

22:37.704 --> 22:40.813
Step aside.

22:40.837 --> 22:42.665
Okay, okay.

22:53.241 --> 22:56.287
- So, you weren't experiencing
any symptoms at all?

22:57.637 --> 22:57.811
No warning... it just
came up out of nowhere?

22:58.464 --> 22:59.987
- Yeah. - Huh.

23:01.336 --> 23:03.445
Calculus, wow. I'm...
I'm very impressed

23:03.469 --> 23:05.403
that you can concentrate
on that right now.

23:05.427 --> 23:07.971
- AP test is in a week.
I don't have a choice.

23:07.995 --> 23:10.060
- Well, I'm sure that we can
arrange for a medical extension

23:10.084 --> 23:11.191
under the circumstances...

23:11.215 --> 23:12.454
- People with medical extensions

23:12.478 --> 23:14.828
don't get into Princeton.

23:15.959 --> 23:17.415
Oh, my God... I
think I'm gonna puke.

23:17.439 --> 23:19.112
- Okay, wait a second.
Let me get you something.

23:19.136 --> 23:22.028
There you go. Yeah, okay.

23:22.052 --> 23:24.141
Okay. You're fine.

23:26.448 --> 23:28.470
- I'll check back. - Yeah.

23:28.494 --> 23:31.995
There you go.

23:32.019 --> 23:34.413
I'll be right back, okay?

23:37.067 --> 23:38.436
- We don't have a choice.

23:38.460 --> 23:39.481
We need to put
them in isolation.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.091
- You don't know what it is.

23:41.115 --> 23:43.833
Could be
environmental or drugs...

23:43.857 --> 23:46.052
- Her symptoms came on
awfully quickly, didn't they?

23:46.076 --> 23:48.446
- As of right now,
infection's top of the list.

23:48.470 --> 23:51.014
- All right, then start
the isolation protocol.

23:51.038 --> 23:52.343
- Okay.

23:53.997 --> 23:58.369
- Maggie, I want you to put
another nurse on this case.

23:58.393 --> 24:01.154
- Sharon, everyone's got
too much on their plate.

24:01.178 --> 24:03.200
I'm fine. - You had a lumpectomy

24:03.224 --> 24:06.203
for breast cancer two weeks
ago, and now you're on chemo.

24:06.227 --> 24:08.118
You're immunocompromised.

24:08.142 --> 24:10.947
And we don't know
what these girls have.

24:10.971 --> 24:13.713
- I'm going to be
careful. Don't worry.

24:26.203 --> 24:28.123
- Pressure's tanking again.
- Release the heart.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.449
All right, we need an
intra-aortic balloon pump.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.189
It's the only way
to hold his pressure

24:36.213 --> 24:37.887
while we sew on the graft.
- But we can't x-ray

24:37.911 --> 24:39.454
to see if it's in
the right place.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.847
- So I'm gonna need you
to put your hand in there

24:41.871 --> 24:43.482
to let me know when I'm in.

24:48.835 --> 24:50.924
Don't be afraid to squeeze.

24:53.274 --> 24:56.079
You feel it? - I-I don't know.

24:56.103 --> 24:57.559
I think so.

24:57.583 --> 25:01.064
- Yeah? Okay, turn on the pump.

25:04.111 --> 25:06.437
- Heart rate's down to 63.

25:06.461 --> 25:08.483
54... - It went up too far.

25:08.507 --> 25:11.921
How high is it?
- I don't know... - 45.

25:11.945 --> 25:13.270
- We're cutting off
blood to his brain.

25:13.294 --> 25:14.469
I need to know.

25:16.253 --> 25:20.301
- Yeah, five centimeters.
- Okay, stop the pump.

25:28.135 --> 25:30.940
Okay, turn on the pump.

25:30.964 --> 25:34.204
Marty?
- Weight and pressure are good.

25:34.228 --> 25:35.403
- All right.

25:39.538 --> 25:43.256
- Is he gonna be okay?
Did he have a stroke?

25:43.280 --> 25:44.804
- We'll find out
when he wakes up.

25:47.110 --> 25:49.112
Okay, needle driver back to me.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.947
- No... then you go back
and you look harder, Roger.

25:59.470 --> 26:01.448
Sorry.
- Hey... where's your stash?

26:01.472 --> 26:02.885
- My snacks? - Yeah.

26:02.909 --> 26:04.277
- Are you feeling okay?

26:04.301 --> 26:05.540
- Yeah, it's for that
med student, Steve.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.976
He hasn't stopped
for a minute all day.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.455
I'm just a little
worried about him.

26:08.479 --> 26:10.003
- Here. - Thanks.

26:15.922 --> 26:18.248
- How's he doing?
- I'm trying to warm

26:18.272 --> 26:20.990
the blood up for him,
but his temp's down to 96

26:21.014 --> 26:22.295
and if he gets any more
hypothermic, it's just gonna

26:22.319 --> 26:24.515
make him bleed even
more, so I mean I...

26:24.539 --> 26:25.908
- Well, he's stable right
now, so why don't you

26:25.932 --> 26:27.020
take a quick break, okay?

26:29.196 --> 26:32.479
- Ah, thanks.

26:32.503 --> 26:34.897
- Mm-hmm. - But I'm fine.

26:37.987 --> 26:39.965
Just life in the E.D., right?

26:39.989 --> 26:41.663
- Doctor Choi told you

26:41.687 --> 26:43.578
his first day pregnant
lady story, didn't he?

26:43.602 --> 26:45.101
- Yeah. - Yeah...

26:45.125 --> 26:46.668
It's not always like that.

26:46.692 --> 26:48.104
He doesn't tell stories
about all the earaches

26:48.128 --> 26:49.540
and runny noses.

26:49.564 --> 26:51.368
- April, they need
you back at 3.

26:51.392 --> 26:53.022
- Okay, but first,
get something in you.

26:53.046 --> 26:54.371
- No time. Vents
are starting to fail

26:54.395 --> 26:55.677
and we're running out of hands.

26:55.701 --> 26:58.201
- Where do you need me?

26:58.225 --> 27:00.159
- Eat, change your scrubs,

27:00.183 --> 27:01.378
then I'll find where
you can help out.

27:01.402 --> 27:03.056
- April.

27:04.927 --> 27:07.277
Fine, but you're going to 3.

27:15.721 --> 27:18.221
- This is the third one. We
need to evacuate the E.D.

27:18.245 --> 27:20.005
- Patient care is already
stretched to the limit.

27:20.029 --> 27:22.007
We don't have the manpower.

27:22.031 --> 27:23.574
- I know what I'm asking
for, but are we willing to risk

27:23.598 --> 27:25.532
a massive outbreak?
This could be a superbug,

27:25.556 --> 27:27.404
bacterial meningitis...

27:27.428 --> 27:28.710
- Then again, these
young women are under

27:28.734 --> 27:30.320
a phenomenal amount
of stress, aren't they?

27:30.344 --> 27:31.582
- Stress? We're not talking

27:31.606 --> 27:33.236
headaches and fatigue here.

27:33.260 --> 27:34.716
These girls are having seizures.

27:34.740 --> 27:38.241
- Elsa... - Doctor Halstead!

27:38.265 --> 27:40.243
- Oh, no.

27:40.267 --> 27:44.595
Come on, come
on... What happened?

27:44.619 --> 27:47.076
- It's okay, I'm fine. I'm fine.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.425
- You are burning up.

27:48.449 --> 27:50.209
Ms. Goodwin, we
need to evacuate.

27:50.233 --> 27:52.429
- Okay, do it. - Wait, wait.

27:52.453 --> 27:54.387
Thirty minutes.

27:54.411 --> 27:56.302
I need 30 minutes and all
three of them in one room.

27:56.326 --> 27:58.174
- I'm sorry, are you crazy?

27:58.198 --> 28:00.089
- Look, if it's an infection,
they've already all got it.

28:00.113 --> 28:01.612
Thirty minutes.
- Thirty minutes, Daniel.

28:01.636 --> 28:03.072
No more.

28:06.119 --> 28:08.227
- Come on, Maggie. You good?

28:08.251 --> 28:09.949
- Yeah... - Let's go.

28:16.607 --> 28:18.653
- Let's go.

28:23.658 --> 28:26.202
- Dr. Manning,
I'm really scared.

28:26.226 --> 28:28.073
- Did he get the blood?

28:28.097 --> 28:29.771
- No. Said there's nothing left.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.666
The whole hospital is out.

28:34.321 --> 28:36.691
- Taylor...

28:36.715 --> 28:39.650
His sats are dropping.
I need to intubate now.

28:39.674 --> 28:41.720
- Here you go.

28:49.075 --> 28:51.183
- Want me to do it?
- No, I got it.

28:51.207 --> 28:54.036
Okay.

28:56.430 --> 28:59.104
- Come on, Taylor, come on.

28:59.128 --> 29:00.782
- Ah, come on.

29:03.176 --> 29:04.612
Damn it.

29:06.048 --> 29:07.634
- Let me do it.

29:07.658 --> 29:09.158
- No, he's just
irritated and swollen.

29:09.182 --> 29:11.445
- Natalie.

29:12.489 --> 29:15.231
All right, make sure you
can see the cords, okay?

29:16.363 --> 29:17.688
- I got it.

29:17.712 --> 29:19.322
- Go nice and
slow. Don't force it.

29:26.329 --> 29:29.245
- There. I'm in.

29:36.078 --> 29:39.797
- His sats are coming up.
- Tell me what else you need.

29:39.821 --> 29:41.823
- Get Doctor Lanik.

30:00.276 --> 30:03.149
- Hi, I'm Doctor Charles.
- What's going on?

30:04.280 --> 30:04.735
Did you get our
test results back?

30:04.759 --> 30:06.128
- Not yet.

30:06.152 --> 30:07.825
- Do you know what's
happening to us?

30:07.849 --> 30:09.871
- I think I do and this medicine

30:09.895 --> 30:12.787
should address your symptoms.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.877
- Is it another antibiotic?

30:15.901 --> 30:17.617
- Actually, it's not...

30:17.641 --> 30:19.837
- But Doctor Halstead
said this was an infection.

30:19.861 --> 30:22.318
- And it must be affecting
our nervous systems.

30:22.342 --> 30:25.669
- And that very
well could be... um...

30:25.693 --> 30:27.889
listen, this might make
you a little groggy,

30:27.913 --> 30:31.090
even relax you a little.

30:38.053 --> 30:41.535
- I don't care, as
long as it works.

30:50.283 --> 30:52.652
Finally a generator.

30:52.676 --> 30:54.306
- Just need to fuel her up.
You got your connections

30:54.330 --> 30:56.091
pre-installed, or do we need
to lay cable down from here?

30:56.115 --> 30:57.919
- No, we're all set.
Come on, let's go.

30:57.943 --> 30:59.790
- Let's go. - Hey...

30:59.814 --> 31:01.748
How long till the power's back?

31:01.772 --> 31:04.123
- Five, ten minutes at most.
- April, it's Darren.

31:08.083 --> 31:09.713
His pressure and
sats are tanking.

31:09.737 --> 31:11.367
- He's gonna code.
We need an ER REBOA.

31:11.391 --> 31:12.890
Inflating a balloon
above his pelvis will stop

31:12.914 --> 31:14.326
the bleeding till we
get the power back.

31:14.350 --> 31:15.937
- He won't make it
all the way back to IR.

31:15.961 --> 31:18.809
- No... we're gonna
do it here. Call trauma.

31:18.833 --> 31:20.071
If we can stop the bleeding,

31:20.095 --> 31:21.880
they need to
ligate his iliacs stat.

31:23.751 --> 31:25.207
- You don't think this
is gonna work, do you?

31:25.231 --> 31:27.929
- VFib. Grab the paddles.

31:36.068 --> 31:38.350
No, no, you.

31:38.374 --> 31:41.029
- Charged to 200.
- You're charged... do it.

31:42.770 --> 31:45.904
Do it! - Okay... clear.

31:52.040 --> 31:55.063
- Did you find Doctor Lanik?
- He's stuck in the E.D.

31:55.087 --> 31:56.281
- Well, we're
running out of time.

31:56.305 --> 31:58.655
I think he's gonna arrest.
- What do we do?

32:00.048 --> 32:01.765
- Get me a thoracotomy tray.

32:01.789 --> 32:03.810
We need to divert
whatever blood he has left

32:03.834 --> 32:05.421
to his heart and his brain.

32:05.445 --> 32:08.772
- How are we gonna do that?
- We're gonna clamp his aorta.

32:08.796 --> 32:10.817
- You're gonna open
his chest? Here?

32:10.841 --> 32:13.777
- Yep.
- And what if we can't find it?

32:13.801 --> 32:16.673
- I don't know. I've
never done it before.

32:37.694 --> 32:40.456
- Pressure's dropping.
- I'm working on it.

32:40.480 --> 32:43.459
Okay... let's open him up.

32:43.483 --> 32:46.312
Easy.

32:48.401 --> 32:50.098
- Clip's off.

32:52.927 --> 32:55.234
- Left anterior wall
still isn't moving.

32:58.324 --> 33:00.345
- There it goes.

33:00.369 --> 33:02.154
- Yes!

33:04.069 --> 33:05.809
Sorry.

33:11.032 --> 33:13.208
Well, look at that.

33:17.734 --> 33:19.843
- Can you feel it?

33:19.867 --> 33:22.348
- No, not yet.

33:24.306 --> 33:28.180
Wait... I almost got it.

33:31.357 --> 33:33.161
Still in VFib.

33:33.185 --> 33:35.032
- Do it. - Okay... clear.

33:35.056 --> 33:37.015
- Clear.

33:38.886 --> 33:40.888
- Sinus rhythm. Get
me a chest x-ray.

33:44.370 --> 33:46.415
Everybody clear.

33:48.504 --> 33:50.178
- Is he still bleeding?
Where's the balloon?

33:50.202 --> 33:52.204
- There... right
above the diaphragm.

33:54.902 --> 33:57.035
- Vitals are holding.

34:01.256 --> 34:03.954
- Bleeding stopped. He's good.

34:15.096 --> 34:18.422
- I got it.

34:18.447 --> 34:20.362
- Wow.

34:27.369 --> 34:30.110
- Let's go, let's go.

34:38.250 --> 34:40.097
- Doris, get those
vents up and running.

34:40.121 --> 34:42.230
Doctor Lanik, triage
surgical patients

34:42.254 --> 34:43.969
and get them up to the O.R.

34:43.994 --> 34:47.452
- Angel, you're with me.
- Everybody, let's move!

34:47.476 --> 34:49.435
- Get me the charge
nurse in the ICU.

34:56.311 --> 34:59.836
- Doctor Choi, trauma's here.

35:05.625 --> 35:07.844
- Hey.

35:08.541 --> 35:10.499
We did it.

35:19.943 --> 35:23.469
- Heard you did the sloppiest
thoracotomy Trauma's ever seen.

35:24.383 --> 35:26.404
Nice job today. - Thanks.

35:26.428 --> 35:28.468
- Doesn't mean I'm not
still keeping an eye on you.

35:31.520 --> 35:34.020
- Everything came back
normal on all three girls.

35:34.044 --> 35:36.675
All right, this makes no sense.

35:36.699 --> 35:38.895
It's been 30 minutes.
Why aren't we evacuating?

35:38.919 --> 35:40.940
- I have no idea.

35:40.964 --> 35:43.358
They stopped twitching.

35:45.752 --> 35:48.731
- What did you do?
- Um... Tic Tacs.

35:48.755 --> 35:50.863
- You gave them a placebo?

35:50.887 --> 35:54.824
- Orange ones have
been my go-to of late.

35:54.848 --> 35:57.435
Don't get me wrong, they're
gonna need some therapy,

35:57.459 --> 35:58.915
you know, figure out
that the weight of the world

35:58.939 --> 36:01.898
isn't on their shoulders.
Maybe a little family work.

36:03.683 --> 36:05.530
- What do you mean?

36:05.554 --> 36:07.358
- You ever hear of mass
psychogenic illness?

36:07.382 --> 36:09.839
- Yeah, like...
mass hysteria, right?

36:09.863 --> 36:11.362
- Very easy to misdiagnose.

36:11.386 --> 36:13.059
I mean, in Salem,
they called it witchcraft.

36:13.083 --> 36:15.540
- So... the seizures
and the tremors...

36:15.564 --> 36:17.716
You're telling me
really were from...

36:17.740 --> 36:19.805
- Stress and anxiety
manifested as physical symptoms

36:19.829 --> 36:22.591
spread through social groups
by unconscious imitation.

36:22.615 --> 36:25.681
Happens a lot
more than you think.

36:25.705 --> 36:27.683
Remarkable how far
our brains will go to avoid

36:27.707 --> 36:29.547
dealing with emotions
we don't wanna confront.

36:38.587 --> 36:40.783
- Hey, uh, either way,
Doctor Halstead...

36:40.807 --> 36:42.025
You did the right thing today.

36:47.379 --> 36:49.313
- Wait. How's Maggie?

36:49.337 --> 36:50.967
- Uh, she says she's fine.

36:50.991 --> 36:52.751
Thinks it must've
just been the heat.

36:52.775 --> 36:54.536
- Good... all right, let's
get her out of isolation.

36:54.560 --> 36:56.431
- Okay.

37:05.788 --> 37:09.115
- Natalie. - Yeah?

37:09.139 --> 37:11.596
- That night, it
didn't feel like

37:11.620 --> 37:13.729
you were coming to tell
me you were engaged.

37:13.753 --> 37:15.600
- What?

37:15.624 --> 37:17.646
- In my car...

37:17.670 --> 37:20.388
I think you were coming
to tell me something else.

37:20.412 --> 37:22.825
- Uh, I'm... I'm
sorry, Will, I'm just...

37:22.849 --> 37:24.938
I've had a really long day.

37:26.461 --> 37:28.613
- Of course. I'm sorry.

37:28.637 --> 37:30.509
- Good night.

37:32.859 --> 37:35.035
- Wait.

37:37.080 --> 37:42.410
I just have to ask...
Do you love him?

37:42.434 --> 37:45.064
Phillip? Are you sure?

37:45.088 --> 37:47.458
- Am I sure that I love him?

37:47.482 --> 37:49.808
- Just tell me.

37:49.832 --> 37:52.594
Do you?

37:52.618 --> 37:54.900
- You know what? My
relationship with Phillip

37:54.924 --> 37:57.084
is the only thing in my
life that's working right now.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.998
Hey, guys.

38:06.022 --> 38:07.894
Hi, you.

38:21.690 --> 38:24.060
- Uh, Doctor Marcel?

38:24.084 --> 38:27.130
I am really sorry about
screwing up the pump.

38:28.523 --> 38:29.959
I could've killed him.

38:31.700 --> 38:34.592
- Are you kidding?
We were doing surgery

38:34.616 --> 38:36.531
on a beating heart
with no electricity.

38:37.924 --> 38:40.642
As far as I can tell, you
got a great set of hands.

38:40.666 --> 38:43.364
I'm sure they'll come of
use in your urgent cares.

38:45.497 --> 38:47.823
- The right specialty...

38:47.847 --> 38:52.610
A surgeon can still
make good money, right?

38:52.634 --> 38:55.961
- Yeah... Ortho, CT, neuro.

38:55.985 --> 38:58.050
And with the right team?

38:58.074 --> 38:59.728
Oof.

39:12.219 --> 39:15.067
- Hey. Good day today.

39:15.091 --> 39:18.506
We'll see you tomorrow.
- No, I'm not coming back.

39:18.530 --> 39:20.943
- What do you mean?

39:20.967 --> 39:24.120
- I love medicine, but
what we did today...

39:24.144 --> 39:27.253
I can't do that every
day for the rest of my life.

39:27.277 --> 39:29.604
- Hey, come on.
It was a crazy day.

39:29.628 --> 39:31.630
- I know, I just...

39:33.936 --> 39:36.548
I just can't.

39:45.600 --> 39:49.537
Was I too hard on him?
- No, not too hard on him.

39:49.561 --> 39:53.018
Just focused on getting our
patients what they needed.

39:53.042 --> 39:55.891
- So I missed seeing
what he needed.

39:55.915 --> 39:59.068
- Babe, you are
such a good doctor.

39:59.092 --> 40:03.725
Sometimes we get so caught
up taking care of everyone else,

40:03.749 --> 40:06.641
we forget to take
care of each other.

40:06.665 --> 40:11.646
- No... you don't.

40:11.670 --> 40:13.976
You don't forget.

40:15.891 --> 40:18.609
You're always so
mindful of everyone,

40:18.633 --> 40:21.680
so aware, so caring.

40:24.204 --> 40:28.837
I know we said someday, but...

40:28.861 --> 40:31.840
you'd make the best mom ever.

40:31.864 --> 40:34.823
I love you. - I love you.
