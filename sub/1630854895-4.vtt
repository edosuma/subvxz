WEBVTT

00:08.466 --> 00:09.509
Okay.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.220
It's gotta be here somewhere.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.103
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.104
Yeah.

00:21.688 --> 00:22.605
Oh no.

00:22.605 --> 00:24.024
Oh God, the window.

00:28.778 --> 00:29.946
Come on, ol' girl.

00:33.658 --> 00:34.743
No.

00:35.535 --> 00:38.163
No, no, no, no, this can't be the diary.

00:38.788 --> 00:39.956
No, no.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.043
No, no. There's got to be something here.

00:44.085 --> 00:45.378
Shit.

00:48.798 --> 00:49.924
No!

00:58.308 --> 01:00.060
Okay, I swear he was here.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.520
- He was here.
-  John B, I--

01:02.520 --> 01:05.023
- No, I swear, he was here, all right?
-  Okay.

01:05.023 --> 01:07.817
I'm not crazy.
Look, that's the boat right there. Okay?

01:07.817 --> 01:11.404
And he was sleeping inside right there.
Look, uh, you believe me.

01:11.404 --> 01:12.739
-  I mean...
-  Right?

01:13.323 --> 01:15.075
Hell, I wouldn't believe him either.

01:16.451 --> 01:17.577
Hello, Sarah.

01:24.209 --> 01:25.585
W... Oh my God.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.212
- Come on, Sarah.
- Where did you go?

01:27.212 --> 01:29.464
Or should I say Mrs. Routledge?

01:29.464 --> 01:31.883
- Welcome to the family, Sarah.
- Where the hell did you go?

01:32.801 --> 01:33.760
Sorry.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.386
I can't...

01:36.554 --> 01:39.516
Come on, son. It's a day of celebration.
Bring it on in, boy.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.643
- Surprise.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.979
I can't... I can't believe it.

01:46.147 --> 01:49.109
-  Welcome to the Outer Banks, Cleo.
-  You're crazy, Pope.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.736
Your parents are not going
to appreciate me shacking up.

01:51.736 --> 01:54.030
Of course they will. Are you kidding?

01:54.531 --> 01:57.367
Heyward might put you to work,
but we could always use the help.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.078
I don't know, man. You sure?

02:00.078 --> 02:03.998
Yeah, look, he might squawk a little bit,
but let me talk to him.

02:03.998 --> 02:05.333
We'll figure it out.

02:09.504 --> 02:11.047
This is me.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.341
Home sweet home.

02:13.341 --> 02:16.136
Damn, Kiara. You live here?

02:16.136 --> 02:18.221
This is like the White House, man.

02:18.763 --> 02:21.891
- How bad you think it's gonna be?
- Scale of one to ten?

02:23.268 --> 02:25.937
- Twenty.
- Do you want us to hold up here?

02:25.937 --> 02:29.732
No, I... I gotta take this.
Thanks for walking me.

02:33.444 --> 02:34.654
Bye, Jayj.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.521
She was
on the container ship with us, okay?

04:31.521 --> 04:35.066
She got stranded on the island with us.
She saved my life,

04:35.066 --> 04:36.901
and we can help her now.

04:37.485 --> 04:38.486
Please.

04:44.701 --> 04:47.078
Okay, while you're out
looking for your city of gold,

04:47.078 --> 04:49.163
I'm gonna go home and steal some clothes

04:49.163 --> 04:51.332
and maybe a phone if I can find it.

04:51.916 --> 04:54.752
- See you later. Road to the mother lode.
- I'll be back.

04:54.752 --> 04:56.629
Six o'clock, back here.
Don't be late.

04:56.629 --> 04:57.630
Toodles.

05:22.113 --> 05:23.906
Brought an old friend to see you.

05:24.991 --> 05:28.077
- Where'd you get this?
- The impound lot. Where do you think?

05:28.077 --> 05:30.705
Where do I think? Um, I don't know.

05:30.705 --> 05:33.666
I'm trying to figure out
why you didn't say when Sarah was here.

05:34.917 --> 05:38.254
- Oh, Dad, come on. Seriously?
- Hey. Just you and me.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.922
You and me, okay, great.

05:39.922 --> 05:42.759
Okay. Well, did you
at least find the diary?

05:42.759 --> 05:45.636
Yeah, I found the diary, all right.
It was a big pile of mush.

05:45.636 --> 05:47.847
The window was left down.
It got rained on.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.016
You could have shut the window.

05:50.016 --> 05:54.270
Well, uh, there were some complications.
I wasn't planning on being gone that long.

05:54.270 --> 05:56.147
Yeah, well, that diary's done.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.901
But I got another idea. Plan B. Come on.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.278
- Plan B. Okay.
- Riches and glory. Come on.

06:02.278 --> 06:03.988
- Let's go.
- This is great. This is great.

06:03.988 --> 06:06.407
She'll be all right. Get in.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.494
- Okay.
- What are you doing? Let's go.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.955
Take care of your people.
You said it best.

06:19.545 --> 06:20.922
Just so we're clear,

06:22.298 --> 06:25.093
we're not keeping anything from Sarah.

06:26.969 --> 06:28.054
Okay?

06:28.638 --> 06:30.098
She's one of us, Dad.

06:30.848 --> 06:33.184
You lost the gold, right?

06:33.851 --> 06:36.187
To her father.
And the cross to her brother.

06:36.187 --> 06:38.481
It was a coincidence, Dad. Okay?

06:38.481 --> 06:40.441
- Just a coincidence?
- Yes, Dad!

06:42.402 --> 06:44.779
Look, it's... it's better

06:45.321 --> 06:48.032
to keep intel on a... a need-to-know basis.

06:48.741 --> 06:51.244
Trust me. I learned that the hard way.

06:53.037 --> 06:55.498
Look, Bird, it's just you and me.

06:55.498 --> 06:56.582
Okay, buddy?

06:57.750 --> 06:58.751
For now.

07:02.171 --> 07:03.756
Yeah. So where we going?

07:03.756 --> 07:07.260
We are stopping
by your history teacher's house, John B.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.678
Mr. Sunn?

07:08.678 --> 07:11.097
Well, he had the original diary, right?

07:11.097 --> 07:13.349
Then vanished
once word got out that he had it.

07:14.058 --> 07:16.853
I doubt it's here,
but it ain't gonna hurt to check.

07:18.312 --> 07:19.397
Let's go!

07:21.732 --> 07:22.567
Come on.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.323
Nobody's home.
We should probably get outta here.

07:29.323 --> 07:31.784
Hey, John B. Come on, we're here already.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.537
Let's have some fun.
Take a look around. What do you say?

07:34.537 --> 07:37.165
Have some fun?
I thought you said he was in hiding.

07:37.165 --> 07:38.624
I said he was missing.

07:38.624 --> 07:41.586
He could be in hiding,
or he could be... [imitates gunshot] ...done.

07:41.586 --> 07:44.172
But seeing as how he's not here,

07:44.172 --> 07:47.884
I don't think he'd mind
if we looked around a little bit.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.719
Still got it.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.013
Oh, a little breaking and entering
with my pops.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.474
Just add it to the list of felonies.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.017
Come on.

07:56.684 --> 07:57.643
Mr. Sunn?

07:58.311 --> 08:01.397
- Is anybody home?
- The original diary, what's it look like?

08:01.981 --> 08:04.358
Leather-bound, about yea big.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.110
All right, check everywhere.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.328
Leather-bound, leather-bound.

08:29.967 --> 08:31.844
Hey, John B!

08:31.844 --> 08:33.387
- Come on.

08:42.688 --> 08:43.898
Mr. Sunn.

08:55.868 --> 08:58.579
Stay down.
Don't even think about getting up.

09:00.706 --> 09:04.210
- Is this what you're looking for?
-  You son of a bitch.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.212
Sorry, buddy. You're too late.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.296
Let's go, let's go.

09:07.922 --> 09:08.756
Hey, hey.

09:08.756 --> 09:10.258
Hey. You all right?

09:11.008 --> 09:13.135
Come on, come on.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.430
Hey! Hey!

09:17.014 --> 09:18.766
Hey!

09:24.355 --> 09:25.565
Mr. Sunn.

09:26.357 --> 09:28.859
Hey, hey. You okay?

09:28.859 --> 09:31.237
- Yeah, I've been better.
- I got you.

09:31.237 --> 09:34.865
I came... came out of hiding
to meet those two gentlemen.

09:34.865 --> 09:36.075
What? Those guys?

09:36.075 --> 09:37.410
They're smugglers.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.329
They said they were
from the historical society.

09:40.329 --> 09:42.665
I guess my professional vanity
got the best of me.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.376
- Was that the diary they took?
- Yeah.

09:45.376 --> 09:47.253
-  Shit!

09:48.004 --> 09:50.881
- Come on! John B, let's go.
- Go.

09:50.881 --> 09:53.968
We'll get it back, okay, Mr. Sunn?
We'll get it back.

09:56.470 --> 09:58.306
There's only one way to the bay.

09:58.806 --> 10:01.058
- They gotta go under the Wando Bridge.
- Right.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.689
Hey cap,
why does Singh want this thing so bad?

10:06.689 --> 10:07.690
Who cares?

10:08.274 --> 10:10.234
All I know is if we deliver this,

10:10.776 --> 10:13.696
we got no problems with customs
in the West Indies anymore.

10:19.535 --> 10:21.746
A little heavy on the brake
at the top of the curve.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.248
- You're losing momentum.
- Are you critiquing my driving now?

10:24.248 --> 10:26.459
I'm surprised.
I thought I taught you better than this.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.543
Okay.

10:29.378 --> 10:31.297
-  Whoo!

10:33.633 --> 10:35.926
- Shit.

10:37.928 --> 10:39.513
All right! That a boy!

10:44.101 --> 10:45.102
Come on.

10:46.145 --> 10:48.272
- That's the boat. That's it.
- Come on.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.734
-  Let's go, let's go!
- Dad, I'm going!

10:52.318 --> 10:53.694
John B, they're getting away!

10:55.863 --> 10:57.448
Jesus, look at this.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.327
They clear that jetty,
we're never getting that diary.

11:01.327 --> 11:04.330
All right,
I got an idea. Okay, hang on.

11:09.293 --> 11:10.670
Come on. I know a guy.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.088
Come on.

11:13.923 --> 11:17.426
- You sure about this?
- I got this kid a fake ID. He owes me one.

11:18.135 --> 11:20.846
A WaveRunner? What you want to do?
Stop by the Ocean Club?

11:20.846 --> 11:23.974
- These things are fast as shit, old man.
- All right, come on then.

11:23.974 --> 11:26.519
Hurry it up, John B.
We're gonna lose them.

11:28.688 --> 11:29.772
Get on. Let's go.

11:31.607 --> 11:32.983
All right. Come on.

11:32.983 --> 11:35.361
Move, move. Hey!

11:35.361 --> 11:37.321
Hey, hey! Yeah!

11:37.321 --> 11:39.824
Yeah, yeah, press it, John B. Let's go!

11:42.785 --> 11:44.662
Whoo!

11:50.292 --> 11:52.795
Listen, I know these guys.
They're dangerous. What are we doing?

11:52.795 --> 11:53.713
Just keep going.

11:57.341 --> 11:58.217
Hey!

11:59.760 --> 12:00.845
That's them.

12:04.098 --> 12:04.974
Hey!

12:04.974 --> 12:06.684
We ain't gonna outrun them.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.566
We just wanna talk!

12:14.650 --> 12:17.778
Okay, okay.
They're turning around. What's the plan?

12:17.778 --> 12:20.781
Show them your hands, John B.
You wanna get shot?

12:20.781 --> 12:21.866
Okay.

12:22.616 --> 12:23.492
Jesus.

12:23.492 --> 12:26.036
What the hell are they doing?
Let's get rid of them.

12:26.036 --> 12:27.163
What do you want?

12:27.163 --> 12:29.081
-  You know this guy, right?
- Yes, yes.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.792
- What's his game?
- He's a smuggler. He moves cargo.

12:31.792 --> 12:34.044
-  Highest bidder guy.
- Yes, exactly.

12:34.044 --> 12:35.421
All right. Okay.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.506
No sudden movements.

12:37.506 --> 12:40.676
Hello! Just want
to talk to you for a moment.

12:40.676 --> 12:43.387
We're unarmed, sir. We bare no malice.

12:46.223 --> 12:49.727
We didn't... we didn't have a chance
to converse back at Mr. Sunn's.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.438
We just wanted
to avail you of an opportunity

12:52.438 --> 12:54.732
to compound your winnings, as it were.

12:57.234 --> 12:59.111
You got 30 seconds. Talk.

12:59.111 --> 13:02.156
You have in your possession
an old book?

13:02.156 --> 13:04.241
A... a diary, correct?

13:05.075 --> 13:09.455
And I presume that you procured
that diary at a client's request,

13:09.455 --> 13:13.250
and I'm assuming that client
is a Mr. Singh from Barbados, huh?

13:14.084 --> 13:17.505
Okay. Do you know
why the great and powerful Singh

13:17.505 --> 13:20.132
would want this old book so badly?

13:20.633 --> 13:23.511
Well, it's not because of
the book's inherent value, sir, no.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.262
It's what the book leads to.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.515
What is that?

13:27.515 --> 13:30.893
Something worth a lot more than
what he's probably paying you, my friend.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.019
The boy's right.

13:32.853 --> 13:36.816
You two are in a unique
and potentially profitable position.

13:36.816 --> 13:42.238
You have in your possession a vital piece
of a very valuable and old puzzle.

13:43.030 --> 13:46.033
But the thing is,
I have a piece of it as well.

13:46.617 --> 13:50.788
Now if we put these two pieces together,
then the value is compounded.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.581
I believe we need each other.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.542
Who are you?

13:55.125 --> 13:56.710
I'm Big John Routledge.

13:58.045 --> 13:59.255
You're Routledge?

14:00.881 --> 14:03.425
The treasure hunter?
The guy who went missing?

14:03.425 --> 14:04.635
Guilty as charged.

14:04.635 --> 14:07.763
This is my son. The one
who found the Cross of Santo Domingo.

14:07.763 --> 14:08.681
Remember me?

14:09.348 --> 14:12.476
I'm afraid we do know a bit
about the subject of treasure.

14:12.476 --> 14:17.273
Rather than threatening the only two guys
that can make you filthy rich,

14:17.273 --> 14:19.650
I'd like to propose
a way that we work together

14:19.650 --> 14:21.151
to our mutual benefit.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.654
How does that sound? Sound good?

14:27.825 --> 14:28.868
Shoot the kid.

14:31.620 --> 14:35.332
We take the old man to Singh.
He'll pay a lot more than they ever will.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.837
Yeah. Come on, we'll talk.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.299
All right. [chuckles] All right.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.759
We'll talk. That's good. This is good.

14:47.344 --> 14:48.345
Take us on in, boy.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.933
All right. All right, here we come.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.730
-  Nice and easy.
-  That's right. Take it slow.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.440
Hey. Easy, partner.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.610
It's just a simple business proposition.
That's all.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.361
- We're gonna work together.
- Tie off.

15:04.361 --> 15:05.529
Tie us off, boy.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.657
This will work out well for all of us.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.002
No!

15:43.442 --> 15:45.611
- Dad, Dad, Dad, don't.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.329
I had no choice.

15:55.329 --> 15:58.123
They were gonna do it to us.

16:03.545 --> 16:04.755
Help me out, boy.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.174
John B.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.344
You gonna help me, boy?

16:17.184 --> 16:18.143
Hey.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.771
What's with the sign?

16:21.355 --> 16:22.564
Eviction notice.

16:24.274 --> 16:26.735
For, like, nonpayment or whatever.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.406
Doesn't matter.

16:31.365 --> 16:32.908
This place sucks anyway.

16:32.908 --> 16:35.411
Great to be back
in the Outer Banks, right?

16:36.662 --> 16:37.663
So get this.

16:37.663 --> 16:40.958
I, uh, had an email
waiting for me when I got home.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.711
John B actually found Big John.

16:45.796 --> 16:47.297
He's alive.

16:49.425 --> 16:50.426
Seriously?

16:51.593 --> 16:52.469
Yeah.

16:52.469 --> 16:54.221
He's at the Chateau.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.809
Damn.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.687
Yeah, he thinks we're close

17:01.687 --> 17:04.189
to the same treasure
Singh was talking about.

17:14.700 --> 17:15.701
Hey, look.

17:17.494 --> 17:19.872
My parents didn't even wanna
let me out of the house,

17:20.456 --> 17:22.207
but I told them
I had to come check on you.

17:22.207 --> 17:24.293
Well, it's not me you have to worry about.

17:28.505 --> 17:30.382
Jayj, what's up?

17:31.425 --> 17:32.885
Is it something Pope said?

17:33.635 --> 17:37.598
I know he's not all obsessed
about what happened between me and him.

17:37.598 --> 17:41.810
We're both past that,
but something's bugging you.

17:43.687 --> 17:44.855
It was just weird,

17:45.522 --> 17:47.941
what almost happened on the boat with us.

17:49.735 --> 17:50.861
It was just weird.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.573
- Yeah, yeah.

17:56.950 --> 17:58.160
Yeah, I mean it was...

17:59.536 --> 18:01.246
it was weird for me too, but...

18:04.875 --> 18:05.959
Not bad weird.

18:07.377 --> 18:08.253
No.

18:09.963 --> 18:10.964
Not bad weird.

18:17.554 --> 18:20.557
What are we doing?

18:21.642 --> 18:23.936
What are we doing?
We shouldn't be doing this, nah.

18:23.936 --> 18:24.978
We shouldn't do that.

18:26.563 --> 18:27.564
Yeah.

18:27.564 --> 18:29.358
- We shouldn't!
- If you say so.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.278
I mean, it would all blow up anyway.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.489
You know? Like...

18:36.490 --> 18:38.909
Look at you. You got your new threads on.

18:38.909 --> 18:41.662
Look at me. What do I got?

18:41.662 --> 18:42.579
This?

18:42.579 --> 18:44.248
This piece of shit?

18:46.834 --> 18:49.378
Getting kicked out of this place
in three weeks anyway.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.338
Shit, I don't got parents right now.

18:51.338 --> 18:52.756
Why would you care?

18:53.465 --> 18:55.968
Why would you care?
I'm just some loser that--

18:55.968 --> 18:57.094
JJ.

18:57.678 --> 19:00.222
- You don't do care. No, you don't!
- I do care!

19:01.640 --> 19:04.643
No, you got parents
that live in Figure Eight, you know?

19:04.643 --> 19:06.603
- You know...
- That's not my fault.

19:06.603 --> 19:07.938
That's your future.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.065
You got that.

19:10.899 --> 19:13.819
Look, if you need us,
we're gonna help you. I'm...

19:14.486 --> 19:15.487
I'll help.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.364
It's that right there. Okay? Like--

19:18.323 --> 19:20.325
It's so easy for you to say that.

19:21.618 --> 19:22.619
You know why?

19:23.412 --> 19:24.788
Because you're a Kook.

19:25.372 --> 19:26.665
You're a Kook, Kiara.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.462
Yeah, I'm a Kook.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.175
I was such a Kook

19:36.175 --> 19:39.845
when I was living
in a cave with you for a month.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.972
Soaking in the Kook life.

19:42.472 --> 19:44.808
That's not what I'm talking about. God!

19:46.018 --> 19:47.477
- Jayj, don't leave.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.774
JJ, what the hell?

19:53.650 --> 19:54.568

22:36.855 --> 22:38.565
<i>This is judgment, Rose.</i>

22:44.696 --> 22:47.532
I'm sorry.
I don't expect you to understand.

22:47.532 --> 22:49.242
Of course, I understand.

22:49.743 --> 22:50.744
Ward.

22:51.620 --> 22:52.954
You are a good person.

22:52.954 --> 22:54.456
- No, I'm not. Rose.
- Hey!

22:55.999 --> 22:57.250
You're a good person.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.885
Besides, what were we gonna do
with that cross anyway?

23:07.677 --> 23:09.679
Seriously, it's identifiable.

23:09.679 --> 23:11.306
- It's traceable.

23:11.306 --> 23:14.351
You think the Spanish government
wasn't gonna come looking for it?

23:14.351 --> 23:15.852
- It does us no good.
- No.

23:15.852 --> 23:18.188
- It doesn't.
- We already have the gold.

23:19.856 --> 23:22.192
Yeah, maybe it can help someone else.

23:26.822 --> 23:28.073
I'll find a museum.

23:29.533 --> 23:30.492
Rose.

23:31.660 --> 23:34.454
It'll be a gift from us
and the whole family.

23:35.914 --> 23:37.541
It's a hell of a write-off.

23:39.668 --> 23:41.503
Not that that's why we're doing it.

23:41.503 --> 23:43.296
- Obviously.
- Of course not, yeah.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.216
Ward.

23:52.681 --> 23:53.682
What about Rafe?

23:56.560 --> 23:57.978
He's not gonna like it.

24:00.730 --> 24:02.816
He's just gonna have to understand.

24:04.818 --> 24:06.153
It's what I'm doing

24:06.153 --> 24:09.948
to atone for all of us.

24:34.514 --> 24:38.560
Yeah, they said, um,
two days on the transfer.

24:39.644 --> 24:42.481
It's in the works though, so no worries.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.899
Yeah, yeah.

24:45.525 --> 24:46.985
Yeah, I'm upstairs, why?

24:47.486 --> 24:50.197
You said you wanted
to talk about something. What's up?

24:50.197 --> 24:51.907
Wait, are you being serious?

24:52.741 --> 24:55.952
I was just with you.
What changed since then?

24:55.952 --> 24:57.746
- What are you talking about?

24:57.746 --> 24:59.789
Dad, no, no. Dad.

25:00.540 --> 25:02.542
This cross is mine.
You're taking it from me.

25:02.542 --> 25:05.253
Listen, this is something
that I got through my work,

25:05.253 --> 25:08.256
and now you're trying to make yourself
feel better by giving away my shit?

25:08.256 --> 25:11.468
<i>- And you didn't even tell me?
-</i> This is me telling you right now, son.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.471
<i>We've done some things, Rafe,
you and I, all right?</i>

25:14.471 --> 25:15.597
Oh my God.

25:15.597 --> 25:19.059
Things that we need to atone for,
and donating this cross,

25:19.059 --> 25:21.186
it's a good first step
in the right direction.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.687
I know that in my heart. Okay?

25:22.687 --> 25:25.232
<i>- I don't know. Maybe if Sarah finds out--</i>
-  Sarah!

25:25.232 --> 25:26.942
- There it is! That's it!

25:26.942 --> 25:28.485
Yep, knew it.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.153
<i>There it is, Dad!</i>

25:30.904 --> 25:34.407
Any more of my shit you wanna steal
from me to impress Sarah?

25:34.407 --> 25:36.284
Who doesn't give a shit about you.

25:36.284 --> 25:38.537
It's Wilmington. It's tomorrow night.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.914
<i>Get a pen.
I'll give you the cargo information.</i>

25:49.506 --> 25:52.968
For the record,
this is bullshit. Okay? This is my thing.

25:55.095 --> 25:57.430
But of course, you can count on me.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.015
<i>Okay, so listen.</i>

26:00.225 --> 26:03.019
One second. Okay, Wilmington.

26:03.645 --> 26:04.563
Tomorrow night.

26:05.146 --> 26:06.898
Car 750X. Got it.

26:10.485 --> 26:13.363
-  Hey. Hang on. Hang on. One second.

26:19.661 --> 26:20.787
Hello?

26:40.932 --> 26:43.226
Yeah, from the wharf to the train yard.

26:43.226 --> 26:44.144
Yeah.

26:48.231 --> 26:50.483
Yes. I got it, okay?

26:55.155 --> 26:56.072
Yes, sir.

26:57.449 --> 26:58.366
Shit!

27:05.915 --> 27:09.002
So there I was at the top of this crane

27:09.002 --> 27:11.796
on a huge container ship
in the middle of the ocean.

27:12.547 --> 27:14.466
And what do I hear from down below but...

27:14.466 --> 27:15.925
- Oh no!

27:15.925 --> 27:17.594
Gunshots shooting right back up at me.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.971
- True story.
- Mom, gunshots.

27:20.597 --> 27:23.808
That's when I knew there was no way
we were getting off with the cross.

27:23.808 --> 27:24.726
- So...
- Boy.

27:26.061 --> 27:28.396
- Dropped it in the ocean.
- You did what?

27:28.396 --> 27:30.982
It was the best thing I could do.
And get this,

27:30.982 --> 27:34.444
as soon as I'm jumping off the ship,
we're swimming away, I look back.

27:35.028 --> 27:36.946
- They're pulling it back out.
-  Who?

27:36.946 --> 27:38.823
-  Rafe.
- Rafe.

27:38.823 --> 27:41.326
Honestly, I'm kind of glad he got it.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.203
You on air?

27:43.203 --> 27:45.038
Yeah, I'm with Cleo on that.

27:45.038 --> 27:48.166
I'm just saying, at least
it's not at the bottom of the ocean.

27:48.166 --> 27:52.003
There's a chance, you know? Some hope
that maybe we can get it back from them.

27:52.003 --> 27:55.215
Well, let's hope not.
I had enough of this treasure hunting.

27:57.884 --> 28:00.178
I want people to know that story, Pop.

28:00.929 --> 28:01.846
Denmark Tanny,

28:01.846 --> 28:05.100
who got probably one of the most
valuable objects in all the world,

28:05.100 --> 28:07.727
and he gave it
to a church full of freed slaves,

28:08.645 --> 28:09.479
and it was theirs.

28:11.648 --> 28:13.024
It's a beautiful story.

28:14.901 --> 28:16.528
I think it deserves to be told.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.991
Thank you so much

28:21.991 --> 28:24.160
for helping my boy.

28:24.160 --> 28:27.872
Mm. We helped each other. Right, Pope?

28:31.251 --> 28:32.168
Yeah.

28:38.883 --> 28:42.053
So, uh, this is
where you're going to be staying.

28:42.053 --> 28:44.931
I'll move downstairs,
so it's all yours now.

28:46.224 --> 28:48.518
If you, uh, need me, just give me a knock.

28:51.062 --> 28:54.023
There's one bathroom,
which means we'll probably have to share,

28:54.023 --> 28:56.359
but it's all good
because I take quick showers.

28:56.943 --> 29:00.071
Um, this is my room,
which is now your room.

29:01.030 --> 29:03.491
My mom laid out some fresh clothes.
They should fit.

29:04.075 --> 29:05.160
So this is mine.

29:06.161 --> 29:10.915
Yeah, you know, sorry it's kind of small,
but it's got a great view.

29:14.461 --> 29:16.713
I ain't never had my own room before.

29:19.340 --> 29:20.341
Now you do.

29:27.015 --> 29:32.187
Okay, um, I'll be downstairs.
So, um, if you need me, just give me a...

29:34.272 --> 29:35.231
Enjoy.

29:41.404 --> 29:46.785
<i>♪ Yeah, I'll be waving somewhere

29:46.785 --> 29:49.412

30:32.497 --> 30:34.582

30:42.173 --> 30:44.384
So I went back
to grab clothes and a phone,

30:44.384 --> 30:46.135
and you're not gonna believe this.

30:47.387 --> 30:48.388
Rafe is back.

30:50.265 --> 30:52.058
Yeah. I saw him at the house.

30:52.058 --> 30:54.769
I don't think he saw me,
but I think the cross is coming back

30:55.687 --> 30:57.522
to Wilmington tomorrow night.

30:57.522 --> 30:58.857
- What?
- Yeah.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.359
- Does Pope know?
- No. I was gonna tell him at the Chateau.

31:01.359 --> 31:03.903
- He can't. He's on lockdown.
- Okay. Um...

31:04.779 --> 31:06.865
Then... I'll hit up Pope,

31:07.448 --> 31:10.076
and then maybe you go to the Chateau
and tell John B.

31:10.869 --> 31:11.703
And JJ?

31:14.205 --> 31:16.583
- Yeah, I gotta talk to him anyway.
- Yeah.

31:16.583 --> 31:19.335
Okay. My parents are gonna kill me.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.182
I'll be damned.

31:33.182 --> 31:34.559
Look who it is!

31:34.559 --> 31:37.437
Look at the Country Club walking in!

31:38.313 --> 31:39.564
How you doing, Rafe?

31:39.564 --> 31:42.442
Just coming to have a little powwow.
I come in peace.

31:43.484 --> 31:44.652
You come in peace.

31:47.989 --> 31:51.200
I think I was up for murder one
because of you, right?

31:53.202 --> 31:54.412
Yeah, that sounds right.

31:55.413 --> 31:58.207
It's all good.
I'm ready to get past it if you are.

32:00.084 --> 32:01.044
Yeah.

32:02.503 --> 32:05.548
So, why don't you run it by me?

32:06.466 --> 32:09.510
My family is giving away
something of mine,

32:09.510 --> 32:11.179
a historical artifact.

32:11.179 --> 32:14.349
What you think I give a shit
about that for?

32:14.349 --> 32:17.977
This thing is worth a lot of money.

32:17.977 --> 32:19.062
Okay? A lot.

32:20.229 --> 32:23.816
I can't stop them. At least not without
looking like I'm going back on something,

32:23.816 --> 32:27.236
so... I want you to steal it.

32:27.820 --> 32:29.030
- From me.
- Ah.

32:29.030 --> 32:30.615
- From my family.
- Oh...

32:30.615 --> 32:32.909
It just gets better, don't it?

32:33.493 --> 32:37.372
You must think I'm the stupidest
son of a bitch under the sun.

32:37.372 --> 32:39.749
It's either you trying to set me up,

32:39.749 --> 32:42.877
or you the one that's stupid
because then let me ask you this, Rafe.

32:43.628 --> 32:46.214
How you gonna stop me
from stealing it and keeping it?

32:46.214 --> 32:48.257
Well, you know, one thing... one thing is,

32:48.257 --> 32:51.761
if you screw me like that,
I'll... I'll come after you.

32:51.761 --> 32:53.388
Mm-hmm.

32:54.305 --> 32:57.850
What I'm confused about, though,
is why you would fight it.

32:57.850 --> 33:01.187
I'm offering you a job,
and it's high-risk, it's high-reward.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.231
This is the thing, Barry.

33:03.231 --> 33:06.734
When this very valuable
and irreplaceable thing gets jacked,

33:06.734 --> 33:08.695
um, there's gonna be suspicion on me.

33:09.278 --> 33:10.780
I'll have an ironclad alibi,

33:11.322 --> 33:14.200
so they'll be looking for who I hired.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.285
But no one's going to suspect you.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.205
- Right?

33:19.205 --> 33:22.417
You're the guy who turned me in.
You ratted me out.

33:22.417 --> 33:26.129
I mean,
you're the perfect guy for this job.

33:27.755 --> 33:29.090
It's a free play.

33:29.924 --> 33:32.552
You take this on, you don't mess it up,

33:33.594 --> 33:37.724
you're gonna come out the other end
with a really big pile of dough.

33:39.308 --> 33:40.727
Mm.

33:42.353 --> 33:43.771
I do like money.

33:45.606 --> 33:49.152
Let me give you my terms.
I'm gonna get half of this bitch.

33:50.028 --> 33:53.406
Right down the middle, fifty-fifty.
I ain't taking no bullshit payout, Rafe.

33:53.406 --> 33:54.782
- Okay?
- Okay.

33:55.742 --> 33:57.702
And if we doing this...

33:58.369 --> 34:01.289
...it would behoove you
not to be seen talking to me.

34:03.458 --> 34:04.459
He got my check.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.169
Here you are.

34:16.637 --> 34:17.638
John B!

34:19.682 --> 34:20.683
Yo!

34:21.350 --> 34:22.393
Hey, Jayj.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.357
John B not here?

34:28.357 --> 34:29.442
Nope.

34:35.031 --> 34:36.657
- What up?

34:38.242 --> 34:39.744
Uh, Rafe's what's up.

34:40.286 --> 34:41.412
What do you mean?

34:41.412 --> 34:43.039
Rafe's back on the island.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.250
Sarah saw him.

34:47.543 --> 34:49.170
Spectacular.

34:50.338 --> 34:51.464
It's not just that.

34:53.132 --> 34:56.969
She overheard him saying that the cross
is coming to Wilmington tomorrow night.

34:57.553 --> 34:59.680
Figure he must be trying to sell it.

35:00.890 --> 35:02.558
Great. Does Pope know?

35:03.226 --> 35:05.019
Yeah, Sarah went to tell him.

35:05.019 --> 35:06.354
He's locked down,

35:07.063 --> 35:10.858
and I guess John B and his dad
went and got the Twinkie.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.486
They're off to God knows where.

35:17.073 --> 35:19.450
Yeah, of course. Just when we need them.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.040
- Wait.
- Uh...

35:26.040 --> 35:27.125
Hold on, though.

35:27.959 --> 35:31.754
We know where the cross is gonna be.
That means it's still on the field.

35:31.754 --> 35:34.340
So we can come in and swoop.
We're still in this, Kie.

35:34.340 --> 35:37.593
We gotta get everybody together,
then we'll come up with a plan.

35:37.593 --> 35:39.220
- Get to Wilmington--
- Hey, Jayj.

35:39.220 --> 35:42.849
Before we formulate some crazy plan,
can we talk?

35:47.979 --> 35:48.980
Yeah.

35:50.314 --> 35:51.482
Yeah, we can talk.

35:52.066 --> 35:53.651
Something almost happened

35:54.152 --> 35:55.611
between us on the boat.

35:56.362 --> 35:57.363
Mm-hmm.

35:58.447 --> 36:01.075
And I know that's got to freak you out.

36:02.285 --> 36:04.078
It caught me off guard too.

36:05.955 --> 36:08.416
And I know, your whole life,

36:08.416 --> 36:11.586
I know you freak when people get close,
and I get it.

36:12.461 --> 36:13.671
I don't blame you.

36:16.674 --> 36:19.552
Just please don't ever say
that I don't care about you.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.641
And you called me a Kook.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.145
- Okay. Well, hold on.
- Which is lame.

36:29.145 --> 36:31.230
- I know. That was lame.
- It was uncalled-for.

36:31.230 --> 36:34.317
- Yeah. It's a low blow.
- All right, Kie. Look, Kie.

36:35.860 --> 36:36.861
You're right.

36:38.571 --> 36:39.488
I flipped.

36:40.114 --> 36:41.282
You know how I be.

36:42.241 --> 36:43.659
Just, uh... Just...

36:44.827 --> 36:45.828
Look.

36:46.454 --> 36:48.998
We should just... just call it a truce.

36:50.374 --> 36:52.293
Just Etch A Sketch it.

36:53.336 --> 36:54.337
Clean slate.

36:56.172 --> 36:57.048
Truce?

36:58.507 --> 36:59.467
Truce.

37:08.643 --> 37:10.269
So how we gonna jack this cross?

37:11.646 --> 37:12.605
I don't know.

37:20.780 --> 37:23.908
<i>My pops always said
nothing good comes easy,</i>

37:25.534 --> 37:27.411
<i>and nothing worthy is given.</i>

37:27.411 --> 37:29.413
-  Told you!

37:29.413 --> 37:32.250
<i>- It's not what can be gained.</i>

37:32.250 --> 37:34.710
- Kie!
-  <i>But what you're willing to risk.</i>

37:34.710 --> 37:36.462
I can't hold it!

37:36.462 --> 37:37.380
Hold on!

37:41.259 --> 37:42.760
<i>How far will you go</i>

37:44.345 --> 37:45.471
<i>for your treasure?</i>

37:50.434 --> 37:54.605
So, the diary says there was a...
a survivor of the San Jose.

37:54.605 --> 37:55.856
A... a priest.

37:56.607 --> 38:00.319
Captain Limbrey, yeah, he thought
it was bad karma to kill clergy,

38:00.319 --> 38:02.905
so he stuck the priest
down in the cargo hold.

38:02.905 --> 38:05.366
"The captain left it me to tend
to the priest's swamp fever."

38:05.366 --> 38:08.911
"In his delirium, he implored me
to pass on a letter and a stone object

38:08.911 --> 38:12.373
of native origin to the papacy."
A stone object of native origin!

38:12.373 --> 38:16.127
This is why Singh wanted the diary so bad.
He's talking about the idol here.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.838
Oh my God.
"The captain refused to make the delivery,

38:18.838 --> 38:21.841
and when the man of God died,
he was buried with his belongings."

38:21.841 --> 38:23.301
They were docked in Charleston.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.720
There was only one Catholic church
in Charleston at the time.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.639
Ten to one that priest is buried
in the church plot with his belongings.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.766
That's gotta include
the missing piece of the idol.

38:30.766 --> 38:33.644
We put the two halves together
and translate it...

38:33.644 --> 38:36.063
Are you kidding me?

38:36.063 --> 38:39.859
This is it, John B.
John B, Charleston leads to El Dorado!

38:43.154 --> 38:44.071
I'm done.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.282
John!

38:46.949 --> 38:47.950
Wait a sec.

38:47.950 --> 38:49.035
Hold on now.

38:50.077 --> 38:53.372
-  John B.
- No, you killed those guys, Dad.

38:53.372 --> 38:55.166
Oh.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.793
- Hey, I had no choice.
- What? You pulled on them first!

38:57.793 --> 39:00.588
They'd have taken us to Singh
who would've done the same thing.

39:00.588 --> 39:02.923
- Come on!
- That guy was gonna shoot you, okay?

39:02.923 --> 39:05.968
I couldn't... I couldn't let that happen.

39:06.552 --> 39:08.888
It ain't as fun as it looks, kid, okay?

39:09.764 --> 39:11.557
- Hey, hey!

39:12.475 --> 39:14.602
- No.
- I couldn't lose you again.

39:15.478 --> 39:16.479
I couldn't.

39:17.646 --> 39:20.941
If you wanna hold that against me,
you go right ahead.

39:20.941 --> 39:22.151
I'm guilty as charged.

39:22.151 --> 39:24.570
- I'll bear that burden for eternity.
-  Come on.

39:24.570 --> 39:25.613
But what's done

39:26.655 --> 39:27.656
is done.

39:30.117 --> 39:31.535
And we got work to do.

39:32.953 --> 39:35.873
And none of it means anything
if you aren't along, understand?

39:40.378 --> 39:44.048
So, you can head on down that road

39:44.048 --> 39:45.466
and go back home,

39:46.258 --> 39:50.054
or you get on that bus and come with me
to Charleston on a 500-year quest.

39:50.846 --> 39:52.973
- What do you say?

40:07.947 --> 40:10.282
- Let's go.
