WEBVTT

00:04.137 --> 00:06.128
Okay, price tags done.

00:06.172 --> 00:07.469
Ads in the newspaper, done.

00:07.507 --> 00:08.701
Signs are done.

00:08.742 --> 00:10.141
Oh, wait.

00:10.176 --> 00:11.404
How can we say
"garage sale,"

00:11.444 --> 00:13.071
when we don't even
have a garage?

00:13.113 --> 00:16.082
Mm, how about "yard sale?"

00:16.116 --> 00:17.310
Uh, we don't have
one of those either.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.284
What is this,
truth in advertising week?

00:19.319 --> 00:20.308
What do you think, Kel?

00:20.353 --> 00:22.344
Oh, I don't know.

00:22.389 --> 00:24.186
I'm just not feeling very good.

00:24.224 --> 00:25.384
You think maybe you have
the flu or something?

00:25.425 --> 00:27.086
I don't know.

00:27.127 --> 00:28.924
I'll see you guys later.

00:28.962 --> 00:29.986
Oh, hey, Kel.

00:30.063 --> 00:31.291
Up for the garage sale
tomorrow?

00:31.331 --> 00:34.630
Yeah, whatever.

00:34.667 --> 00:36.157
What's her problem?

00:36.202 --> 00:37.760
New Yanni CD delayed?

00:37.804 --> 00:39.931
She's, uh, been feeling
kind of down lately.

00:39.973 --> 00:42.373
It's more like coming down.

00:42.409 --> 00:44.468
She doesn't have
a drug problem anymore,

00:44.511 --> 00:46.172
she has a problem getting drugs.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074

00:57.023 --> 00:57.990
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:58.024 --> 00:59.491
I mean, c-composition is really

00:59.526 --> 01:00.823
a function of light and...

01:00.860 --> 01:01.827
Colin?

01:01.861 --> 01:04.421
Yeah, just one sec, okay?

01:04.464 --> 01:05.590
It's-it's the way the light

01:05.632 --> 01:06.963
hits the-the canvas.

01:07.033 --> 01:08.330
It's the way the...

01:08.368 --> 01:09.528
Look, I'm sorry.

01:09.569 --> 01:12.367
I'll talk to you
about this later, tomorrow.

01:12.405 --> 01:15.272
They call it
teaching, Kelly.

01:15.308 --> 01:16.707
- It's what they pay me for.
- I know.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.677
I'm sorry. I just need
somebody to talk to, all right?

01:18.711 --> 01:19.700
What's the matter?

01:21.748 --> 01:23.909
I'm just so tired
all the time, you know.

01:23.950 --> 01:25.144
I don't know.

01:25.185 --> 01:27.312
I'm not having
any fun anymore,

01:27.353 --> 01:30.948
and... I just can't seem
to snap out of it.

01:30.990 --> 01:31.979
Are you asking?

01:32.092 --> 01:33.218
Because if you are,
you don't need

01:33.259 --> 01:34.556
to beat around the bush
with me, Kelly.

01:34.594 --> 01:35.618
No, no.

01:35.662 --> 01:36.788
I don't want
to do coke anymore.

01:36.830 --> 01:37.990
I don't think it's good for me,

01:38.064 --> 01:39.292
and I don't think
it's good for you.

01:39.332 --> 01:42.995
I guess you're right.

01:43.036 --> 01:44.833
Look, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to push.

01:46.873 --> 01:48.966
Why? Do you have
any with you now?

01:49.008 --> 01:50.134
You just said
you wanted to stop.

01:50.176 --> 01:53.168
I do, I do.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.879
Just, sometimes it feels
like it would be easier

01:57.917 --> 02:01.182
if I would just do a little
and get me through the day.

02:04.190 --> 02:05.919
Well, it is the weekend.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.792
You won't think I'm weak?

02:09.829 --> 02:11.820
Willpower's overrated.

02:20.540 --> 02:22.531
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.925
Yo, Keats, come and get it!

04:27.033 --> 04:28.295
Mmm.

04:28.334 --> 04:30.359
Thank you. I am so hungry.

04:30.403 --> 04:31.927
What's he doing here?

04:31.971 --> 04:34.098
He's still on assignment.

04:34.140 --> 04:36.335
Doesn't he have a hotel?

04:36.376 --> 04:38.173
Well, I told him

04:38.211 --> 04:39.940
he could use
the office.

04:39.979 --> 04:42.243
Really?

04:42.282 --> 04:43.840
Well, actually,
as an alum,

04:43.883 --> 04:45.111
he does have that privilege.

04:45.151 --> 04:46.277
Great.

04:48.154 --> 04:50.315
Hey, Walsh.

04:50.356 --> 04:52.449
Casten.
Good to see you.

04:52.492 --> 04:53.618
Yeah, I bet.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.594
Okay, uh, boys,
play nice.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.152
Try not to kill each
other while I'm gone.

04:57.196 --> 04:58.163
Yeah.

04:58.197 --> 04:59.164
Look, uh,

04:59.198 --> 05:00.688
the war's over, okay?

05:00.733 --> 05:02.792
The only reason why I'm here is,
I have a lot of work to do.

05:02.835 --> 05:04.803
Okey-doke.

05:06.839 --> 05:09.330
Okay, look, just to show you
that there's no hard feelings,

05:09.375 --> 05:10.740
I've got a very cool
assignment tomorrow.

05:10.777 --> 05:11.937
You may want to come along.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.070
What's that?

05:13.112 --> 05:14.807
I'm doing a feature
on biplanes.

05:14.847 --> 05:15.871
Best flying in the world
is right

05:15.915 --> 05:16.882
up here in the high desert.

05:16.916 --> 05:17.883
You ever been up?

05:17.917 --> 05:19.407
Can't say I have.

05:19.452 --> 05:21.181
Well, it's
awesome.

05:21.220 --> 05:23.711
I've been going up in biplanes
ever since I was about 17.

05:23.756 --> 05:25.155
Shouldn't
be missed.

05:25.191 --> 05:26.158
Really?

05:26.192 --> 05:27.159
Yeah, bring your pals.

05:27.193 --> 05:28.217
I've got some VIP passes.

05:28.261 --> 05:30.627
I don't think so.

05:30.663 --> 05:31.755
Oh, come on,
Walsh.

05:31.798 --> 05:33.231
It's more fun
with a bunch of guys.

05:33.266 --> 05:34.255
We'll have a blast.

05:36.235 --> 05:38.260
Okay.

05:38.304 --> 05:39.965
Well, if you
change your mind,

05:40.006 --> 05:41.234
I'm staying
at La Broca...

05:41.274 --> 05:42.798
you know, those rental
condos down at the beach.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.309
Sure.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.470
Here's my number.

05:47.980 --> 05:49.811
How long are you
going to be in town?

05:49.849 --> 05:51.840
Till they stop buying my ideas.

05:51.884 --> 05:53.351
And I have a lot of ideas.

05:53.386 --> 05:56.287
Cool.

05:56.322 --> 05:57.380
All right,
I'll see you.

05:57.423 --> 05:58.412
Yeah.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.226
What's that?

06:07.266 --> 06:09.063
Jonathan's phone number.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.662
Going flying with him tomorrow?

06:11.704 --> 06:15.196
I don't think I'm going
anywhere with him.

06:15.241 --> 06:17.209
I don't blame you.

06:17.243 --> 06:20.110
Um, here.

06:20.146 --> 06:21.636
Make yourself useful.

06:21.681 --> 06:23.615
What's in the box?

06:23.649 --> 06:26.277
Bunch of stuff for the garage
sale at the beach tomorrow.

06:26.319 --> 06:27.809
Oh.

06:27.854 --> 06:30.049
Out with the old.

06:30.089 --> 06:32.614
See how easy that is?

06:39.031 --> 06:40.896
Don, do you have
any, um, little safety pins?

06:40.933 --> 06:43.527
Um, I'm pin-less,
but try Kelly's room.

06:43.569 --> 06:44.729
Okay.

06:44.771 --> 06:46.102
Oh.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.846
Hey, Clare.

06:59.886 --> 07:01.581
Do you really want
to sell your copy

07:01.621 --> 07:03.316
of Women Who Run
With the Wolves?

07:03.356 --> 07:04.948
Yeah. I already memorized it.

07:06.993 --> 07:09.860
Well, well, well.

07:09.896 --> 07:13.423
Look what I found
in Kelly's drawer.

07:13.466 --> 07:14.933
Is that what I think it is?

07:15.034 --> 07:16.865
Yep.

07:16.903 --> 07:17.892
There's just enough in it

07:17.937 --> 07:19.199
for the police
to have a field day.

07:19.238 --> 07:22.571
Poor Kelly.

07:22.608 --> 07:23.575
Poor Kelly?

07:24.644 --> 07:25.804
What about us?

07:25.845 --> 07:28.211
She's stashing drugs
in our apartment, okay?

07:28.247 --> 07:29.441
If she gets busted,

07:29.482 --> 07:30.642
we're probably gonna
get busted with her.

07:30.683 --> 07:31.945
Oh, wait.

07:32.018 --> 07:34.077
Let's not blow this
out of proportion.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.348
I mean, there's hardly
any in there.

07:35.388 --> 07:36.355
Don,

07:36.389 --> 07:38.550
possession of cocaine,

07:38.591 --> 07:42.186
no matter how much,
has mandatory sentencing.

07:42.228 --> 07:44.662
You serve time.

07:44.697 --> 07:48.463
"Chancellor's Druggie Daughter
and Rose Princess Busted."

07:48.501 --> 07:50.969
That sounds
pretty good, huh?

07:51.003 --> 07:54.131
You got to talk to her.

07:54.173 --> 07:57.734
I know.

07:57.777 --> 07:59.768
I will.

08:04.350 --> 08:05.817
What do you think?

08:05.852 --> 08:07.410
Sell it.

08:11.390 --> 08:12.357
Sell it.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.262
Sell it.

08:17.296 --> 08:19.321
Okay.

08:21.367 --> 08:22.425
Sell it?

08:22.468 --> 08:24.129
Ah. Wear it.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.933
You're so predicable.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.996
Come here.

08:34.113 --> 08:35.102
- Let it ring.
- I can't.

08:35.147 --> 08:36.135
Don't even think about it.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.149
I can't;
it's Donna.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.741
I know she wants
to know where I am.

08:38.784 --> 08:39.751
Hey.

08:39.784 --> 08:41.342
Hi, Val.

08:41.386 --> 08:42.479
Glad I caught you in.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.888
Is this who I
think it is?

08:44.924 --> 08:45.948
Of course.

08:45.992 --> 08:48.085
It's your old pal, Ginger.

08:48.127 --> 08:49.958
You haven't been
returning my calls, Val.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.223
Where are you?

08:51.264 --> 08:52.231
Who cares?

08:52.265 --> 08:53.892
The important thing is,

08:53.933 --> 08:55.332
I'm gonna be in L.A. tomorrow.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.393
No, you're not; we have a deal.

08:57.436 --> 08:58.596
I'll be in around noon.

08:58.638 --> 09:00.230
Are you sending a limo
or you picking me up?

09:00.273 --> 09:01.900
You know the answer to that.

09:01.941 --> 09:03.374
I'm serious, Val.

09:03.409 --> 09:04.876
Look, I told you
last week,

09:04.911 --> 09:06.503
the answer is no.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.513
I'm hanging up now.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.575
Who was that?

09:13.619 --> 09:15.450
Just wrong number.

09:15.488 --> 09:16.750
Come on, who was it?

09:16.789 --> 09:19.257
It was just somebody
I didn't want to talk to.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.486
Can we leave it at that?

09:20.526 --> 09:22.790
Uh, last time you said that,

09:22.828 --> 09:24.625
I ended up having to bail you
out of jail.

09:24.664 --> 09:26.063
David, trust me.

09:26.098 --> 09:29.124
If we just ignore it,
it'll go away, okay?

09:29.168 --> 09:32.069
Like I'm really supposed
to believe that.

09:32.104 --> 09:33.071
David, would
you just

09:33.105 --> 09:34.572
shut up and kiss me?

09:38.978 --> 09:40.912
Well, the way I see it,

09:40.947 --> 09:42.471
you got two ways to
go with this thing.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.415
One, you could
hard line the guy,

09:44.450 --> 09:46.645
which is probably
what he wants.

09:46.686 --> 09:48.483
- And option number two?
- Two?

09:48.521 --> 09:50.045
Play ball with him.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.454
Eventually, he's gonna fold.

09:51.490 --> 09:53.685
Brandon, he's got
free passes to go flying.

09:53.726 --> 09:55.591
Come on, we'll get
Silver, maybe Joe.

09:55.628 --> 09:57.220
We'll have a blast.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.696
Ever been on a biplane before?

09:58.731 --> 09:59.857
No.

09:59.899 --> 10:00.957
Ah, it's the ultimate
roller coaster!

10:01.067 --> 10:01.965
These things
go up,

10:02.068 --> 10:03.228
they go down, they dive,

10:03.269 --> 10:04.634
they barrel, 360, everything.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.228
It's the best roller coaster
you'll ever be on.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.536
Well, that sounds
a little better.

10:08.574 --> 10:09.836
See, I told you.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.240
If I'm right, I'm right,

10:11.277 --> 10:13.973
but if not, at least we get
a free day of flying out of it.

10:20.886 --> 10:23.650
Hey, knock,
knock.

10:23.689 --> 10:25.350
We're here. What do
you want us to do?

10:25.391 --> 10:27.120
Leave.

10:27.159 --> 10:28.148
What's with her?

10:28.194 --> 10:30.355
You were supposed to
be here hours ago.

10:30.396 --> 10:31.363
So? We're a little late.

10:31.397 --> 10:32.364
Give us a break.

10:32.398 --> 10:33.922
Give us a break.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.729
What's going on?

10:35.768 --> 10:38.999
Can, uh, can we talk
to you privately?

10:39.105 --> 10:40.163
Let's get out of here, Kelly.

10:40.206 --> 10:41.503
This is getting
a little too weird for me.

10:41.540 --> 10:42.871
Yeah.

10:42.908 --> 10:44.307
Good idea.
Have fun with your sale.

10:44.343 --> 10:45.332
Look, Kel...

10:46.479 --> 10:48.208
you either
talk to me now

10:48.247 --> 10:50.306
or don't ever
talk to me again.

10:56.522 --> 10:58.149
Colin, can you wait
for me in the car?

10:58.190 --> 10:59.418
I'll just be
a minute.

10:59.458 --> 11:00.447
Yeah, sure.

11:04.263 --> 11:06.458
Am I grounded?

11:06.499 --> 11:08.194
No, but you are
out of line.

11:08.234 --> 11:11.169
I forgot about the stupid sale.

11:11.203 --> 11:12.670
What do you want me to do?

11:12.705 --> 11:13.899
You want me to buy something?

11:13.939 --> 11:15.702
- Will that make you feel better?
- No, Kel.

11:15.741 --> 11:18.073
Clare found something
in your room.

11:19.045 --> 11:21.343
What were you doing in my room?

11:21.380 --> 11:23.439
- This isn't about me.
- I don't care who it's about.

11:23.482 --> 11:25.382
It doesn't give you the right
to go through my stuff.

11:25.418 --> 11:26.885
Kel, please,

11:26.919 --> 11:28.113
we're worried about you.

11:28.154 --> 11:29.587
Donna, there's nothing
to worry about.

11:29.622 --> 11:30.714
I am fine, okay?

11:30.756 --> 11:31.723
Well, I don't think
you are fine.

11:31.757 --> 11:32.951
Everything is going great

11:32.992 --> 11:33.959
in my life.

11:33.993 --> 11:35.824
I'm getting better grades

11:35.861 --> 11:36.657
than I've ever gotten.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.685
I'm in shape,

11:37.730 --> 11:38.788
I'm in love.

11:38.831 --> 11:40.230
Everything's great.

11:40.266 --> 11:41.426
Yeah.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.230
Everything's hunky-dory,

11:43.269 --> 11:44.964
if you overlook the fact
that you're addicted

11:45.004 --> 11:46.369
to a lethal narcotic.

11:46.405 --> 11:50.136
I am not addicted to anything,
Clare.

11:50.176 --> 11:51.700
Really?

11:51.744 --> 11:53.211
- Yeah.
- You know,

11:53.245 --> 11:54.610
you are so full of it.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.911
You're totally high right now.

11:56.949 --> 11:59.850
You know, I'm not gonna
stick around here, okay,

11:59.885 --> 12:01.318
and get busted because you leave
your little drugs

12:01.353 --> 12:03.685
around the apartment,
okay?

12:03.723 --> 12:05.054
Fine. Then why don't you leave
the apartment?

12:05.091 --> 12:06.319
Good idea. Maybe I will.

12:06.358 --> 12:07.552
- You guys...
- You know what?

12:07.593 --> 12:09.788
I have a better idea.
I'll move out.

12:09.829 --> 12:11.660
No, Kelly, don't go.
That's not what we want.

12:11.697 --> 12:13.961
I don't care what you guys want.
I'm out of here.

12:13.999 --> 12:14.966
Kel?

12:15.000 --> 12:15.967
What?

12:16.001 --> 12:18.094
Do us a favor, okay?

12:19.672 --> 12:21.469
Take the evidence
with you.

12:45.498 --> 12:46.988
Don't worry, Donna.

12:47.066 --> 12:48.533
Biplaning is a safe sport.

12:48.567 --> 12:50.592
No, miniature golf
is a safe sport.

12:50.636 --> 12:53.332
Going up in a biplane,
that does not sound safe to me.

12:53.372 --> 12:56.000
Go light, Joe, or you'll be
wearing this in a few hours.

12:56.108 --> 12:59.100
See?
Even Nat's concerned.

12:59.145 --> 13:00.237
I am not.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.543
A biplane
is practically crashproof.

13:02.581 --> 13:04.310
Practically?

13:04.350 --> 13:05.715
Would you tell her to relax,
Nat?

13:05.751 --> 13:07.275
Relax, Nat.

13:07.319 --> 13:09.719
Oh, thanks. That makes me
feel so much better.

13:09.755 --> 13:10.949
I'll just have the
orange juice,

13:11.056 --> 13:12.080
coffee and toast,
please, Nat.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.216
I'll have the same,
please.

13:13.259 --> 13:14.886
You got it.

13:14.927 --> 13:17.157
So, you haven't said
a word about Kelly.

13:17.196 --> 13:18.629
Did she call you
back last night?

13:18.664 --> 13:20.723
No, and I'm not about
to call her.

13:20.766 --> 13:23.257
You'll see.
She'll probably show up today,

13:23.302 --> 13:25.099
and it will be like nothing
ever happened.

13:25.137 --> 13:28.300
I think it's a little too late
for that.

13:43.455 --> 13:44.786
What are you doing?

13:44.824 --> 13:48.760
I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep.

13:48.794 --> 13:51.786
I figured if I'm moving in, I'd
better make room for my stuff.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.696
Take as much space as you need.

13:53.732 --> 13:56.826
I wish my friends would have
said the same thing,

13:56.869 --> 13:59.463
but they don't even know
what space is.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.905
They think that being a good
roommate means rummaging

14:01.941 --> 14:05.069
through my stuff,
not to mention my life.

14:05.110 --> 14:07.601
Stop. Don't get yourself
all worked up.

14:07.646 --> 14:09.511
Look, you got a great place
to land here,

14:09.548 --> 14:11.413
and you can stay
as long as you want.

14:14.386 --> 14:16.286
Do you think
I could have another line?

14:18.324 --> 14:19.951
You know where it is.

14:20.059 --> 14:21.788
You don't have to ask me.

14:21.827 --> 14:24.318
Thanks.

14:24.363 --> 14:28.322
I just feel like they're ganging
up on me or something.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.925
So what? They're straight.

14:29.969 --> 14:31.698
Forget about them.

14:31.737 --> 14:34.865
Believe me, I'm trying.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.811
It's been in my family
for generations.

14:49.855 --> 14:52.847
I mean, the sentimental value
alone is incalculable.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.120
I'll give you 50 cents.

14:54.159 --> 14:55.592
Sold.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.459
How much is this?
It's not marked.

14:57.496 --> 14:59.623
Uh, hey, Donna, how much
for the yellow sweater?

14:59.665 --> 15:00.632
Three dollars.

15:00.666 --> 15:03.601
Three dollars?
I'll take it.

15:03.636 --> 15:04.864
Sorry.
It's already sold.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.428
Why are you selling this
anyway?

15:06.472 --> 15:07.632
It's practically brand-new.

15:07.673 --> 15:08.901
Not mine. Kelly's.

15:08.941 --> 15:10.431
Where is Kelly anyway?

15:10.476 --> 15:13.104
Sleeping with her new roomie.

15:13.145 --> 15:15.340
Oh, she moved in with Colin?

15:15.381 --> 15:17.645
It's only temporary.

15:17.683 --> 15:19.947
Yeah, till she regains
her sanity.

15:20.019 --> 15:22.510
- I thought you both liked Colin?
- Yeah, well,

15:22.554 --> 15:23.714
there's a couple things
you don't know

15:23.756 --> 15:25.519
about our little artist friend.

15:25.557 --> 15:26.683
How much is the typewriter,

15:26.725 --> 15:28.716
or is that already sold, too?

15:28.761 --> 15:30.228
It's mine.

15:30.262 --> 15:32.958
Make an offer.

15:33.065 --> 15:34.760
Don't you think
it's not a good idea

15:34.800 --> 15:36.768
to broadcast Kelly's problems
to everybody?

15:36.802 --> 15:39.066
Why?
I don't really care who knows.

15:39.104 --> 15:40.867
- Clare.
- What?

15:40.906 --> 15:43.670
Val, you're right, we shouldn't.

15:43.709 --> 15:45.609
Whatever.

15:49.014 --> 15:50.413
Caffeine?

15:50.449 --> 15:52.440
Ooh, good timing.
Thanks.

15:53.852 --> 15:56.514
Hi. Why didn't you go
flying with the guys?

15:56.555 --> 15:58.887
'Cause dive-bombing
and pulling Gs

15:58.924 --> 16:00.619
isn't exactly my idea
of a good time.

16:00.659 --> 16:03.890
Joe said it wasn't dangerous.

16:03.929 --> 16:08.298
At 10,000 feet,
anything's a little dangerous.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.478
Wow, it's spectacular up here.

16:27.519 --> 16:28.508
Casten!

16:28.554 --> 16:30.044
I thought you
punked out on me.

16:30.089 --> 16:31.488
No, sir, Captain George.

16:31.523 --> 16:33.320
- How you doing?
- I'm doing real fine.

16:33.359 --> 16:34.656
You look great, man,
you look great.

16:34.693 --> 16:35.819
- So do you, kid.
- This is Joe Bradley,

16:35.861 --> 16:37.089
- Hi.
- Steve Sanders

16:37.129 --> 16:38.096
and Brandon Walsh.

16:38.130 --> 16:39.757
- How you doing?
- Captain George.

16:39.798 --> 16:40.958
Glad to have you aboard, fellas,

16:41.033 --> 16:42.796
and it's just George
since I retired.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.065
Jonathan tells me
you're all cherry flyers.

16:45.104 --> 16:47.129
Well, not me.
I've done this before.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.605
Oh, how many flights
have you made, son?

16:48.640 --> 16:50.198
One.

16:51.443 --> 16:52.967
Well, we'll all
get up in the air

16:53.078 --> 16:54.102
before the day is out.

16:54.146 --> 16:55.477
We'll even do
some aerobatics.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.982
But first we're gonna start
with an introductory flight,

16:58.017 --> 16:59.211
if that's okay
with you, Steve.

16:59.251 --> 17:01.685
Just say yes.
Yes.

17:01.720 --> 17:03.017
Is this our plane here?

17:03.055 --> 17:04.613
Yep. Uh, Jonathan,

17:04.656 --> 17:07.021
- are you piloting today?
- Oh, you bet I am.

17:07.059 --> 17:09.527
Wait a second...
you're the pilot?

17:09.560 --> 17:10.492
Yeah. Well, if it'd
make you feel better,

17:10.529 --> 17:11.496
maybe George
could take you.

17:11.530 --> 17:12.723
Oh, no, fellas,

17:12.765 --> 17:14.493
you don't have
anything to worry about.

17:14.532 --> 17:15.500
Jonathan's one of the best

17:15.534 --> 17:16.660
that ever came
out of this school.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.294
Yeah, well, I paid
him to say that.

17:18.337 --> 17:19.326
Thanks, man.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.633
Look, uh, if it makes you

17:20.672 --> 17:21.934
feel any better,
I'll make it easy.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.531
I'll take you.

17:23.575 --> 17:24.872
All right, then.

17:24.910 --> 17:26.309
Who's going with me?

17:26.345 --> 17:27.710
Go ahead.

17:27.746 --> 17:29.407
No, go ahead.

17:29.448 --> 17:30.779
I'll catch the next flight.

17:30.816 --> 17:31.942
Thank you so much.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.575
Come on, Walsh,
you're going to love it.

17:33.619 --> 17:34.950
I'm telling you,
you're gonna love it.

18:24.703 --> 18:26.034
Sure.

18:30.909 --> 18:32.376
Well, Walsh, what do you think?

18:32.411 --> 18:34.777
- Awesome.
- I tried to tell you.

18:34.813 --> 18:36.371
Well, I'm glad I came.

18:36.415 --> 18:38.440
You ready for
some aerobatics?

18:39.751 --> 18:41.184
Uh, maybe later.

18:41.220 --> 18:44.383
Funny, Susan's not usually
attracted to cautious guys.

18:44.423 --> 18:46.118
Just watch where
you're flying, would you?

18:46.158 --> 18:47.955
Yes, sir.

18:47.993 --> 18:49.051
Hang on.

19:00.272 --> 19:01.170
Ah...

19:08.547 --> 19:09.912
Had enough, Walsh?

19:09.948 --> 19:12.644
- Is that the best you can do?
- Okay.

20:06.438 --> 20:08.770
So you think Kelly's
serious about moving out?

20:10.175 --> 20:13.008
I don't think Kelly knows
what she wants right now.

20:14.680 --> 20:16.705
I think she just wants
to get away from anyone

20:16.748 --> 20:17.976
who will remind her

20:18.083 --> 20:20.813
that what she's doing
is killing her.

20:20.852 --> 20:23.150
I just don't get how
someone as smart as Kelly

20:23.188 --> 20:25.019
could let this
happen to her.

20:26.592 --> 20:30.153
You don't have to be dumb
to get hooked, believe me.

20:30.195 --> 20:31.389
And Jackie?

20:31.430 --> 20:33.489
D-Does she know?

20:33.532 --> 20:35.523
I didn't tell her.

20:36.702 --> 20:38.636
Maybe we should.

20:38.670 --> 20:40.297
I don't know.

20:40.339 --> 20:42.807
I know when you guys
told my dad,

20:42.841 --> 20:45.036
it didn't exactly
inspire me to quit.

20:46.712 --> 20:49.840
It almost did
the opposite, actually.

20:49.881 --> 20:52.679
So what do we do?

20:52.718 --> 20:54.777
Honestly?

20:56.221 --> 20:59.213
We do what we can
as friends.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.885
But the truth is,

21:00.926 --> 21:02.951
if Kelly doesn't want
to straighten out,

21:03.028 --> 21:06.794
nothing we say or do
is gonna make any difference.

21:21.013 --> 21:22.310
So did you hate it?

21:22.347 --> 21:23.939
Not at all, not at all.

21:23.982 --> 21:25.540
Good, cool. I'm glad.

21:25.584 --> 21:26.710
Unbelievable,
how was it?

21:26.752 --> 21:27.810
Oh man, it was awesome.

21:27.853 --> 21:29.252
Casten's a heck of a pilot.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.516
It looked incredible
from down here.

21:30.555 --> 21:31.954
Casten, I'm going
up with you, man.

21:31.990 --> 21:33.082
You got it.
You got it.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.320
Whoo!
Man, that was awesome!

21:39.164 --> 21:40.461
Oh, he's kidding,
right?

21:40.499 --> 21:42.057
No, it must
be the Gs.

21:43.101 --> 21:44.466
This could be serious.

21:44.503 --> 21:45.765
Someone should
call a medic.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.203
Just give me some room.

21:48.874 --> 21:50.000
Ooh.

21:50.042 --> 21:51.669
- You all right, son?
- Easy.

21:51.710 --> 21:52.836
What happened?

21:52.878 --> 21:54.106
Must have been too much for you.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.477
You passed out.

21:58.483 --> 22:00.917
How you doing, bro,
you all right?

22:00.952 --> 22:02.943
Yeah. I'm fine.

22:03.055 --> 22:05.250
Well, okay,
then, Steve?

22:05.290 --> 22:06.882
What do you say?
You ready to go up?

22:06.925 --> 22:08.586
Steve, uh...

22:08.627 --> 22:10.424
we should probably
get Joe home, huh?

22:10.462 --> 22:11.520
Yeah. You know what?

22:11.563 --> 22:13.394
I'm going to go get
the car, all right?

22:13.432 --> 22:15.696
Yeah... uh, but...

22:21.773 --> 22:22.933
You all right?

22:22.974 --> 22:24.908
Yeah, I think so.

22:24.943 --> 22:26.570
Hey, Brandon,
do me a favor...

22:26.611 --> 22:27.578
don't tell anyone,

22:27.612 --> 22:29.170
especially Donna.

22:29.214 --> 22:31.148
I don't want her
to start worrying.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.775
It could be your heart, man.

22:32.818 --> 22:34.786
Yeah.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.788
I know.

22:36.822 --> 22:38.813
I feel okay.

22:40.425 --> 22:41.824
All right.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.521
It's your life.

22:45.030 --> 22:47.021
Yeah.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.163
This is darling.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.331
How much is it?

22:54.373 --> 22:55.863
Uh, sorry, he's not for sale.

22:55.907 --> 22:57.101
Why not?

22:57.142 --> 22:59.372
'Cause he's my boyfriend,
all right?

22:59.411 --> 23:01.641
I'll give you $5 for him.

23:01.680 --> 23:04.114
Sold.

23:04.149 --> 23:06.276
He was never a very good kisser
anyway.

23:06.318 --> 23:08.752
Hmm.

23:15.293 --> 23:17.090
So, what's it like

23:17.129 --> 23:19.097
with Jonathan being around,

23:19.131 --> 23:20.860
the old and the new together?

23:20.899 --> 23:22.332
Truth?

23:22.367 --> 23:24.232
It's a pain.

23:24.269 --> 23:25.793
It's making Brandon miserable.

23:25.837 --> 23:27.429
I had no idea.

23:27.472 --> 23:29.372
So you're not interested
in Jonathan anymore?

23:29.408 --> 23:30.136
No.

23:30.175 --> 23:31.437
Well, then lose him.

23:31.476 --> 23:33.410
Well, it's not that easy.

23:33.445 --> 23:36.608
I mean, I did tell him we could
still be friends, and...

23:36.648 --> 23:38.275
Well, that was
your first mistake.

23:38.316 --> 23:40.181
But I don't give Brandon
a hard time

23:40.218 --> 23:41.617
when he spends time with Kelly.

23:41.653 --> 23:42.813
No comment.

23:42.854 --> 23:45.448
Are you saying
I have a reason to be concerned?

23:45.490 --> 23:48.084
No. No, not at all.

23:49.895 --> 23:52.830
I just wish Jonathan
would get over me, that's all.

23:52.864 --> 23:54.229
He will.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.995
Unless that's not
what you really want.

23:56.067 --> 23:57.466
It is.

23:57.502 --> 24:00.266
Guess I'm just not very good
at being the bad guy.

24:00.305 --> 24:01.567
Val?

24:01.606 --> 24:02.732
Phone's for you.

24:02.774 --> 24:04.708
Well, stick with me.

24:04.743 --> 24:06.574
I'll teach you
how to be heartless.

24:09.047 --> 24:11.038
I may take you up on that.

24:12.417 --> 24:13.782
Thanks.

24:13.819 --> 24:14.945
Hello?

24:14.986 --> 24:16.647
Surprise. I'm here.

24:16.688 --> 24:18.212
Just like I said.

24:18.256 --> 24:19.723
Why are you doing this?

24:19.758 --> 24:20.952
Doing what?

24:20.992 --> 24:24.484
I'm visiting my oldest
and dearest friend,

24:24.529 --> 24:26.156
who, for some reason,

24:26.198 --> 24:28.393
is not making me feel
very welcome.

24:28.433 --> 24:30.230
How did you find me here?

24:30.268 --> 24:31.394
I phoned around.

24:31.436 --> 24:32.960
Nobody seemed to be home.

24:33.071 --> 24:35.403
Then Nat said
you were probably at the sale.

24:35.440 --> 24:36.805
Wait. You talked to Nat?

24:36.842 --> 24:37.968
Relax.

24:38.009 --> 24:39.567
He didn't know who it was.

24:39.611 --> 24:41.977
By the way, I just love
what you've done

24:42.080 --> 24:43.980
with your bedroom
since I was here.

24:44.082 --> 24:45.208
You're in my bedroom?

24:45.250 --> 24:46.581
How did you get in the house?

24:46.618 --> 24:47.846
Come on, silly.

24:47.886 --> 24:50.218
I still have the key
from my last visit.

24:50.255 --> 24:52.416
Listen, Ginger,
this may have slipped your mind,

24:52.457 --> 24:54.925
but as far as everybody
around here is concerned,

24:54.960 --> 24:56.825
we're not supposed
to be friends anymore.

24:56.862 --> 25:00.195
I know, Val,
and I hate to blow your cover,

25:00.232 --> 25:03.224
but I don't have any place
to stay.

25:03.268 --> 25:04.792
Any ideas?

25:04.836 --> 25:07.737
Are you telling me if I don't
accommodate your little whims,

25:07.772 --> 25:09.740
you're gonna go back on our deal

25:09.774 --> 25:11.366
and tell everybody
we scammed them?

25:11.409 --> 25:12.933
Okay, I'll come over there,
then.

25:12.978 --> 25:15.412
It will be nice
to see the girls.

25:15.447 --> 25:19.042
And I'm sure
they would love to see me.

25:19.084 --> 25:20.449
No.

25:20.485 --> 25:21.952
No, just... just stay there.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.545
I'll... I'll pick you up
and get you settled.

25:24.589 --> 25:25.749
That's so nice.

25:25.790 --> 25:27.087
I thought you might.

25:27.125 --> 25:28.251
And hurry.

25:33.231 --> 25:34.858
It's not her money.

25:34.900 --> 25:36.731
What are you talking about?

25:36.768 --> 25:38.395
Oh, cut the
crap, Ginger.

25:38.436 --> 25:39.960
You're the one who had your hand
in the cookie jar.

25:40.038 --> 25:41.164
You're the thief.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.231
I am not.

25:46.278 --> 25:48.143
Oh, there's my watch.

25:49.047 --> 25:50.571
How could you do this to me?

25:57.589 --> 25:59.557
Hey, you mind if I take off?

25:59.591 --> 26:01.456
I'm kind of tired
of playing shopkeeper.

26:01.493 --> 26:02.755
Yeah, sure.

26:02.794 --> 26:04.159
No problem.

26:07.198 --> 26:09.132
Is everything okay?

26:09.167 --> 26:12.193
No, actually, I'm terrible.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.000
What happened?

26:15.040 --> 26:17.440
Ginger's back in town.

26:18.677 --> 26:20.577
Kleptomaniac
from Buffalo Ginger?

26:20.612 --> 26:21.943
Yeah.

26:22.013 --> 26:24.311
So? It's not like
you have to invite her over

26:24.349 --> 26:25.475
for dinner or anything.

26:25.517 --> 26:28.281
She called me from my bedroom.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.288
- What?
- Listen,

26:30.322 --> 26:31.482
I got to get her out of there

26:31.523 --> 26:32.649
before the junior
birdmen get back.

26:32.691 --> 26:34.955
Is there anything
I can do to help?

26:35.026 --> 26:36.425
Yeah, actually.

26:36.461 --> 26:39.328
Um, can you check her into
a good hotel, and I'll pay?

26:39.364 --> 26:41.264
Wait. You're going
to pay to put her up?

26:41.299 --> 26:43.062
It's complicated.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.398
Yeah.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.336
Everything with you
is complicated.

26:46.371 --> 26:48.703
David, please,
do this for me, okay?

26:50.709 --> 26:51.937
Sure.

26:51.977 --> 26:53.342
Whatever you need.

26:53.378 --> 26:55.346
Thanks.

26:56.381 --> 26:58.372
You're a lifesaver.

27:13.832 --> 27:16.357
We have a... We have
a reservation, I think.

27:16.401 --> 27:19.996
Honey, where
are your manners?

27:27.278 --> 27:28.506
There you go.

27:28.546 --> 27:29.774
Thanks.

27:29.814 --> 27:30.940
Tell me again

27:30.982 --> 27:32.745
why Valerie couldn't
meet me herself?

27:32.784 --> 27:33.773
She's busy.

27:33.818 --> 27:36.946
Well, it's okay this time.

27:37.055 --> 27:40.286
Do you want to stay
and have some lunch with me?

27:40.325 --> 27:42.452
No, thanks.

27:42.494 --> 27:45.088
Come on, David.

27:45.130 --> 27:46.757
I hate to eat alone.

27:46.798 --> 27:49.232
Yeah, well,
call me unreasonable,

27:49.267 --> 27:51.235
but I don't feel
like sharing a meal

27:51.269 --> 27:54.432
with somebody who tried
to rip off me and my friends.

27:54.472 --> 27:57.669
Is everybody going
to dredge all that up again?

27:57.709 --> 28:00.439
So, what are you doing here
anyway, Ginger?

28:00.478 --> 28:02.878
Oh.

28:02.914 --> 28:04.882
Valerie didn't tell you?

28:04.916 --> 28:06.076
No.

28:06.117 --> 28:07.607
Really?

28:07.652 --> 28:09.916
Hmm.

28:09.988 --> 28:13.947
It's not like Val
to keep secrets, is it?

28:18.263 --> 28:20.322
Look, um,

28:20.365 --> 28:21.889
she said she'd see you tonight.

28:21.933 --> 28:24.265
I-I got to get going.

28:24.302 --> 28:26.429
You gonna be okay?

28:26.471 --> 28:29.065
I guess.

28:35.814 --> 28:37.304
Hello, room service?

28:39.718 --> 28:40.912
Room service.

28:40.952 --> 28:43.546
What is your champagne
selection like?

28:46.691 --> 28:47.919
Well, we did pretty good.

28:47.959 --> 28:50.450
Yup, and the best part
is, now we can go shopping

28:50.495 --> 28:52.258
and fill up our closets
all over again.

28:53.698 --> 28:56.462
Okay, I think I ended up
with more than I started with.

28:56.501 --> 28:57.627
Me, too.

28:57.669 --> 28:59.364
- Thanks a lot for inviting me.
- Yeah.

28:59.404 --> 29:00.462
You guys want to
stay for dinner?

29:00.505 --> 29:02.200
Can't. Got a date.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.265
Jonathan or Brandon?

29:04.309 --> 29:05.105
Oh.

29:05.143 --> 29:06.201
It seemed like

29:06.244 --> 29:07.336
such a simple question.

29:07.378 --> 29:08.777
- You're terrible.
- I know.

29:08.813 --> 29:09.905
Hmm.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.718
Hello. Garage Sale Central.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.185
Oh, hi. Hold on.

29:15.220 --> 29:16.414
Val, it's David.

29:16.454 --> 29:18.285
Oh, thanks.

29:18.323 --> 29:19.449
Yup.

29:20.658 --> 29:23.092
Hey. How's it going?

29:23.128 --> 29:24.755
Well, she's all tucked in.

29:24.796 --> 29:26.821
Did she say
what she was doing here?

29:26.865 --> 29:27.923
She said you'd know.

29:28.032 --> 29:29.556
Well, I don't.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.434
She also said
you wouldn't tell me.

29:32.470 --> 29:34.597
Oh, so you believe her over me?

29:34.639 --> 29:36.937
Val, just relax, okay?

29:37.041 --> 29:39.566
Why? So I can just let her waltz
in here and screw everything up?

29:39.611 --> 29:40.942
Screw what up?

29:41.012 --> 29:42.502
David, she's poison.

29:42.547 --> 29:44.708
I got to make sure
she stays out of our lives.

29:44.749 --> 29:46.717
In the meantime, just don't
tell anybody she's here, okay?

29:46.751 --> 29:47.775
Valerie...

29:49.154 --> 29:51.122
Please, just... just promise me.

29:51.156 --> 29:54.057
Okay, fine, I-I promise.

29:54.092 --> 29:56.185
Thanks.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.326
Hey, Jonathan, uh,
bathroom's right there.

30:05.370 --> 30:06.564
Door next to the stairs.

30:06.604 --> 30:07.730
Great. Thanks.

30:07.772 --> 30:09.831
Uh, I told you
he wasn't such a bad guy.

30:09.874 --> 30:11.341
Well, thanks for the
personality assessment, Steve.

30:11.376 --> 30:12.707
but I still
don't trust him.

30:12.744 --> 30:15.212
I hope you don't mind,
but I'd still like to go back

30:15.246 --> 30:16.372
and get my ride sometime.

30:16.414 --> 30:17.540
No problem.
Good.

30:17.582 --> 30:18.844
How do you think Joe is?

30:18.883 --> 30:20.077
Joe's fine.

30:20.118 --> 30:21.881
I'm telling you, man,
I almost passed out

30:21.920 --> 30:23.820
on a few of those nosedives
we were taking.

30:23.855 --> 30:25.550
Yeah, but he was still
pretty green on the ride home.

30:25.590 --> 30:27.285
He's a big boy.

30:27.325 --> 30:28.451
Hey, guys.

30:28.493 --> 30:29.721
Hey, Clare.
Hey, baby.

30:29.761 --> 30:31.092
Hi. How was
your flying?

30:31.129 --> 30:34.496
Mm, well, actually,
I didn't get a chance to fly.

30:34.532 --> 30:36.591
We had a little
medical emergency.

30:36.634 --> 30:37.965
Joe fainted.

30:38.002 --> 30:39.492
It was no big deal.

30:39.537 --> 30:40.629
He's fine.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.731
So, how'd the sale
of the century go?

30:42.774 --> 30:44.537
Um, pretty decent,

30:44.576 --> 30:46.737
except, um, Kelly
flaked on us big time.

30:47.712 --> 30:49.509
In every sense
of the word.

30:49.547 --> 30:51.105
What's that mean?

30:51.149 --> 30:52.411
It means, Brandon,

30:52.450 --> 30:54.782
if you have any influence
over her at all,

30:54.819 --> 30:56.377
now's the time
to use it.

30:59.123 --> 31:00.283
I'm serious, guys.

31:00.325 --> 31:01.656
She's going down fast.

31:01.693 --> 31:02.887
I thought she quit.

31:02.927 --> 31:05.293
Well, that's what
she wants us to think.

31:09.767 --> 31:11.735
Any idea where she is now?

31:11.769 --> 31:14.863
Probably at, uh,
Colin's loft of sin

31:14.906 --> 31:16.897
deviating her septum.

31:16.941 --> 31:18.374
Great.

31:18.409 --> 31:19.569
I'm supposed to meet Susan.

31:19.611 --> 31:20.509
Brandon...

31:20.545 --> 31:22.308
Yeah, I know.

31:22.347 --> 31:24.406
I'll, uh, stop by there
on my way.

31:24.449 --> 31:26.440
Hey, you want me
to go with you?

31:26.484 --> 31:28.611
No. I don't want her to think
we're double-teaming her.

31:28.653 --> 31:30.382
Let me, uh,
talk to her alone first.

31:32.857 --> 31:33.585
Hi, Jonathan.

31:33.625 --> 31:34.751
How you doing?

31:34.792 --> 31:36.623
Hey, listen, uh,
give Susan my best, will you?

31:36.661 --> 31:37.787
Yeah, will do.

31:37.829 --> 31:39.421
Hey, listen, thanks
for a good time today.

31:39.464 --> 31:41.091
Anytime. Anytime.
I'll see you guys.

31:41.132 --> 31:43.157
- See you.
- Thanks again.

32:02.353 --> 32:03.752
Who is it?

32:03.788 --> 32:04.914
It's me.

32:06.124 --> 32:07.250
Who?

32:07.292 --> 32:08.281
It's Brandon.

32:10.428 --> 32:12.623
Brandon, uh, what do you want?

32:12.664 --> 32:14.154
I just want to talk to you.

32:14.198 --> 32:15.324
Will you open the door?

32:15.366 --> 32:17.493
No, no... I can't
see you right now.

32:17.535 --> 32:18.661
Okay? Go away.

32:18.703 --> 32:19.931
Kelly, open the door.

32:33.685 --> 32:35.653
Brandon, I don't want you

32:35.687 --> 32:39.418
to see me like this,
so could you just go?

32:39.457 --> 32:42.517
I'm not going anywhere.

32:44.829 --> 32:46.626
Colin's gonna be home
in a minute,

32:46.664 --> 32:49.098
and, uh, I-I don't... I don't
think you should be here.

32:51.402 --> 32:54.394
Why don't you come with me?

32:54.439 --> 32:56.430
Come on.

33:00.144 --> 33:01.406
Come on.

33:23.401 --> 33:25.062
Can you at least
put the top up?

33:25.103 --> 33:26.297
It's freezing.

33:26.337 --> 33:27.463
Cold is good.

33:27.505 --> 33:29.166
Fresh air is good.

33:29.207 --> 33:31.107
Try breathing it in
through your nose.

33:31.142 --> 33:33.633
Give it a new
sensation.

33:41.119 --> 33:43.110
Here, put this on.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.489
You know, Brandon,
you're really making

33:49.527 --> 33:52.655
a big deal out
of nothing.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.221
I don't think so.

33:54.265 --> 33:56.733
So I get high
once in a while.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.201
It's not the end
of the world.

33:58.236 --> 34:00.966
- I can handle it.
- Mm-hmm.

34:01.005 --> 34:02.370
It was just to help me

34:02.407 --> 34:03.931
get through some work,
all right?

34:04.008 --> 34:05.305
Right.

34:05.343 --> 34:06.332
And what's next, Kel,

34:06.377 --> 34:08.038
the "drugs are
good for you" rap?

34:08.079 --> 34:09.273
"Just say yo"?

34:10.348 --> 34:11.645
We're... we're quitting.

34:11.681 --> 34:13.047
We already talked about it.

34:13.083 --> 34:15.780
It... just got a little
out of control,

34:15.820 --> 34:18.152
but it's over,
all right?

34:18.188 --> 34:20.623
Brandon, I appreciate
your concern.

34:20.658 --> 34:21.955
Really, I do.

34:22.025 --> 34:24.085
Can you just
take me back now?

34:24.128 --> 34:26.755
I don't think so.

34:26.797 --> 34:28.458
Colin is waiting
for me.

34:28.498 --> 34:30.228
Colin is the reason
you're in this mess.

34:30.268 --> 34:33.260
Oh, I see, that's what
this is about, isn't it?

34:33.304 --> 34:35.534
Me and Colin,
and you can't handle it.

34:35.572 --> 34:36.630
Right? Admit it.

34:36.674 --> 34:38.972
Give me a little credit,
would you, Kelly?

34:39.010 --> 34:40.375
I'm doing this for you.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.379
No. What you're doing
is bringing me down.

34:42.413 --> 34:43.744
That's the
general idea.

34:43.781 --> 34:46.079
What are you gonna do,
drive me around all night?

34:46.117 --> 34:47.607
If I have to.

34:47.652 --> 34:49.585
Take me back
to Colin's.

34:49.620 --> 34:50.587
Forget it, Kel.

34:50.621 --> 34:53.248
- Brandon!
- It's not happening.

35:07.138 --> 35:08.571
So, what do you think?

35:08.606 --> 35:10.437
I wouldn't recommend it.

35:10.475 --> 35:12.705
I think it's a little much
for Buffalo.

35:12.743 --> 35:14.938
Well, I think I'm a
little much for Buffalo.

35:14.979 --> 35:17.072
That's why I don't
plan on going back.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.946
Besides, I think
we're both

35:19.050 --> 35:20.745
really California girls.

35:21.786 --> 35:22.912
It's too bad you don't like it.

35:22.954 --> 35:24.387
You did pay for it.

35:24.422 --> 35:27.152
Tell me you didn't charge
all of these to the room, too.

35:27.191 --> 35:29.625
Gee, Valerie, you should
have just invited me

35:29.660 --> 35:30.957
to the garage sale.

35:30.995 --> 35:32.428
It would have been
a lot cheaper.

35:32.463 --> 35:34.158
Okay, let's just
cut the act now,

35:34.198 --> 35:35.722
because it seems to me
that I paid you

35:35.766 --> 35:36.858
more than enough already.

35:36.901 --> 35:39.165
Does $5,000 ring a bell?

35:39.203 --> 35:41.171
- Vaguely.
- Well, we had a deal

35:41.205 --> 35:43.571
that you were supposed to stay
away from L.A., remember?

35:43.608 --> 35:44.973
So now I'm back.

35:45.042 --> 35:46.566
Five K doesn't last very long.

35:46.611 --> 35:48.545
Champagne? You bought it.

35:49.580 --> 35:52.174
Okay, Ginger.

35:52.216 --> 35:54.150
Bottom line.

35:54.185 --> 35:55.982
What do you
really want?

35:56.020 --> 35:57.817
You just don't get it.

35:57.855 --> 35:59.516
I'm really getting rooted here.

35:59.557 --> 36:01.457
And that David is a great guy.

36:01.492 --> 36:04.086
Wait, "that David" is mine.

36:04.128 --> 36:06.756
No lie, girl, he is very hot.

36:06.797 --> 36:09.322
And rooted is cool,
don't you think?

36:09.367 --> 36:10.356
I like rooted.

36:10.401 --> 36:12.369
I mean, we could get
an apartment together.

36:12.403 --> 36:13.768
Look, we made a deal.

36:13.804 --> 36:15.431
I think it's time for you to go.

36:16.474 --> 36:18.533
Yeah, all right.

36:18.576 --> 36:21.739
I... I thought we could hang
for old time's sake.

36:21.779 --> 36:23.508
But if you really want me
to go...

36:23.548 --> 36:24.708
I want you to go.

36:24.749 --> 36:25.875
All right.

36:28.653 --> 36:31.349
For $50,000,
I'll call my travel agent.

36:33.824 --> 36:34.950
Yeah, right.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.357
Like that might ever happen.

36:36.394 --> 36:38.919
It'd better.

36:38.963 --> 36:43.400
Or we'll be replaying
that old September song.

36:43.434 --> 36:47.336
I cannot believe
how stupid they are.

36:47.371 --> 36:49.737
I mean, falling for this?

36:49.774 --> 36:51.571
Maybe they'll erect
a statue of me

36:51.609 --> 36:54.407
in the Peach Pit...
Saint Valerie.

36:58.482 --> 37:00.677
I can't wait to see
your good friends' faces

37:00.718 --> 37:02.583
when they hear
how you scammed them.

37:02.620 --> 37:04.918
- I can't believe you taped me.
- Hey,

37:04.989 --> 37:06.786
I thought it might come
in handy sometime.

37:06.824 --> 37:08.086
You're blackmailing me.

37:08.125 --> 37:09.422
I thought we were supposed
to be friends.

37:09.460 --> 37:11.428
Think of it as stay-away pay.

37:11.462 --> 37:12.486
Forget it.

37:12.530 --> 37:13.929
I'm not giving you another dime.

37:13.998 --> 37:16.694
Don't dare me, Valerie.

37:16.734 --> 37:18.531
You know I'll do it.

37:19.570 --> 37:20.867
What are you really after?

37:20.905 --> 37:22.896
A taste of the good life.

37:22.940 --> 37:25.238
I helped set you up.

37:25.276 --> 37:27.141
Now you have
a successful business,

37:27.178 --> 37:30.409
a great place to live
and friends.

37:30.448 --> 37:32.541
I just want something, too.

37:34.986 --> 37:39.150
Well, if I were you,
I'd rethink this whole thing.

37:40.758 --> 37:42.282
Checkout time's noon.

37:55.973 --> 37:57.873
Mm, Jonathan,
can you hold on a second?

37:57.908 --> 38:00.399
Yeah, it's my other line. Okay.

38:00.444 --> 38:01.411
Hello?

38:01.445 --> 38:02.912
Hi, it's me.

38:02.980 --> 38:06.381
Uh, look, I'm really sorry,
but, uh, I'm running late.

38:06.417 --> 38:07.782
Well, it's okay, do you want me

38:07.818 --> 38:09.217
just to meet you
at the restaurant?

38:09.253 --> 38:11.619
I don't know, we may have
to do this another night.

38:13.624 --> 38:15.114
Actually, I'm, uh...

38:15.159 --> 38:17.286
I'm in the middle
of a nightmare.

38:17.328 --> 38:18.920
It may take a while.

38:18.996 --> 38:21.021
Brandon,
it took me two weeks

38:21.065 --> 38:22.930
to get reservations at Sophia's.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.524
I was really looking forward
to this.

38:28.105 --> 38:29.595
I know, I'm sorry.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.232
I... I just can't.

38:32.543 --> 38:33.805
I-I-I gotta go.

38:33.844 --> 38:34.936
I'll explain later, bye.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.423
Jonathan, you still there?

38:51.462 --> 38:53.191
For you... always.

38:53.230 --> 38:54.356
Who was that?

38:54.398 --> 38:55.865
Brandon.

38:55.900 --> 38:57.561
I just got stood up for dinner.

38:57.601 --> 38:58.898
Really?

38:58.936 --> 39:01.666
Well, I was wondering...
when did you plan to eat?

39:01.706 --> 39:03.503
What are you talking about?

39:03.541 --> 39:05.702
Well, when I was at Brandon's
this afternoon,

39:05.743 --> 39:08.143
I heard something about him
going over to Kelly's tonight.

39:08.179 --> 39:09.646
Kelly's?

39:09.680 --> 39:11.204
Yeah, that's what he said.

39:11.248 --> 39:12.476
Look, face it, Suse.

39:12.516 --> 39:14.040
There's something going on
between those two.

39:15.920 --> 39:17.820
No, I don't believe this.

39:17.855 --> 39:20.915
Yeah... well, does this mean
you're free for dinner tonight?

39:20.958 --> 39:22.550
I am now.

39:22.593 --> 39:24.254
How does dinner
at Sophia's sound?

39:24.295 --> 39:25.626
Great.

39:38.976 --> 39:40.068
Hello?

39:40.111 --> 39:41.601
Good evening.

39:41.645 --> 39:43.306
Now, before you say anything,

39:43.347 --> 39:45.872
I just want to tell you
that you were right.

39:45.916 --> 39:47.850
I was?

39:47.885 --> 39:50.945
With friends,
it shouldn't be about money,

39:51.021 --> 39:54.855
so I thought about it,
and I know what I want.

39:54.892 --> 39:56.757
It's really not that much.

39:56.794 --> 39:58.762
Can't this wait? I mean,
David has a migraine,

39:58.796 --> 39:59.854
and we're already sleeping.

40:00.931 --> 40:03.729
What I want,
you won't even miss,

40:03.768 --> 40:06.737
because I'll return it
as soon as I'm done with it.

40:08.172 --> 40:09.605
And then, I'm out of your life,

40:09.640 --> 40:11.505
and your secret will go with me.

40:11.542 --> 40:13.305
Ginger, cut to the chase.

40:13.344 --> 40:14.902
I want your boyfriend.

40:15.946 --> 40:17.607
David? Are you crazy?

40:17.648 --> 40:18.979
I must be.

40:19.083 --> 40:21.608
I'm giving up 50 grand
for a night with him.

40:22.653 --> 40:23.847
So...

40:23.888 --> 40:27.483
what do you think
of my indecent little proposal?

40:28.526 --> 40:30.118
I think you're totally sick.

40:30.161 --> 40:31.992
Thanks.

40:32.029 --> 40:33.656
I thought you'd like it.

40:33.697 --> 40:35.221
Ciao.

41:04.161 --> 41:05.958
I don't know,
maybe it's nothing.

41:06.030 --> 41:07.292
Joe, you passed out.

41:07.331 --> 41:09.356
How could that
be nothing?

41:09.400 --> 41:11.163
I knew I shouldn't
have told you.

41:11.202 --> 41:13.636
The pilot said that
it happens all the time.

41:13.671 --> 41:15.730
Yeah, well, what did he
say about when it happens

41:15.773 --> 41:19.209
to people with weak hearts?

41:21.712 --> 41:23.339
Just promise me
you'll let my father

41:23.380 --> 41:24.677
check you out again.

41:24.715 --> 41:26.774
Okay.

41:29.687 --> 41:30.984
I don't even have
the strength

41:31.021 --> 41:34.980
to say, "I told you so."

41:35.092 --> 41:37.617
What if something
happens to you?

41:37.661 --> 41:39.891
Nothing is gonna
happen to me.

41:39.930 --> 41:42.990
I feel much better.

41:43.067 --> 41:45.194
Well, I don't.

41:47.872 --> 41:50.204
I'm scared.

41:53.277 --> 41:55.745
The truth is, so am I.

42:00.384 --> 42:01.408
Kel?

42:01.452 --> 42:02.714
Hey, hey.

42:02.753 --> 42:05.551
Hey, Brandon's been trying
to get a hold of you.

42:09.860 --> 42:11.794
I'll be right back.

42:19.970 --> 42:21.562
Kel?

42:21.605 --> 42:23.869
Um, will you tell Brandon

42:23.908 --> 42:25.398
that his car
is parked out front?

42:25.442 --> 42:27.273
And tell him
that the next time he tries

42:27.311 --> 42:28.801
to kidnap me,
I'll call the police.

42:28.846 --> 42:30.837
What...
what are you talking about?

42:30.881 --> 42:32.473
Never mind.

42:32.516 --> 42:34.746
I'll come back and get the rest
of my stuff tomorrow

42:34.785 --> 42:37.083
or the next day...
if that's all right.

42:37.121 --> 42:38.952
Right... what's going on?
Are you okay?

42:38.989 --> 42:40.388
I'm moving out.

42:40.424 --> 42:42.619
No, Kelly, you can't.

42:42.660 --> 42:44.252
Yes, I can.

42:44.295 --> 42:46.490
What do you want,
a written notice?

42:46.530 --> 42:47.861
No, but you don't have to.

42:47.898 --> 42:49.889
I just think it would be better
for everybody.

42:49.934 --> 42:50.901
Please.

42:50.935 --> 42:52.095
Please don't do this.

42:52.136 --> 42:53.899
Donna, I am sick and tired

42:53.938 --> 42:56.270
of justifying my life
to everybody around here,

42:56.307 --> 42:58.172
and I... I'm just not
gonna do it anymore.

42:58.208 --> 43:00.005
But, Kel...

43:00.044 --> 43:01.944
you're my best friend.

43:02.046 --> 43:05.743
The truth is I've outgrown
this place, all right?

43:06.784 --> 43:08.251
And what about me?

43:14.792 --> 43:16.123
I'm sorry.
