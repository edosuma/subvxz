00:30.291 --> 00:32.708
OK. Here we go.

00:32.792 --> 00:36.291
Hello. Hey, Dr. Blake!

00:36.375 --> 00:38.500
It's me. Ya know, Craig.

00:38.583 --> 00:41.541
I've just arrived at
the hotel you recommended,

00:41.625 --> 00:43.541
and I gotta tell you, man,
it's a...

00:43.625 --> 00:45.265
Ooh, it's definitely
what we talked about.

00:45.333 --> 00:49.416
It's great. It's great
for our purposes. It's...

00:49.500 --> 00:51.833
Yeah, let me show you.

00:51.917 --> 00:55.708
Here we are. Room 104.

00:55.792 --> 00:59.041
<i>You know, it's pretty blank
and boring,</i>

00:59.124 --> 01:01.041
<i>but most importantly,
it's clean.</i>

01:01.124 --> 01:02.458
<i>And I took your advice</i>

01:02.541 --> 01:04.541
<i>and I removed
all the bed covers,</i>

01:04.625 --> 01:06.208
<i>so this is clean, um,</i>

01:06.291 --> 01:07.917
<i>what else did I do?</i>

01:07.999 --> 01:09.625
<i>I removed all the soaps,</i>

01:09.708 --> 01:11.625
so those are all new soaps.

01:11.708 --> 01:13.999
And that's me!
Hello, Dr. Blake!

01:16.208 --> 01:18.500
I wiped down all the surfaces
with bleach too,

01:18.583 --> 01:20.750
so... yeah.

01:22.625 --> 01:23.999
Well, as you can see,

01:24.083 --> 01:26.416
not much has really changed
on my body

01:26.500 --> 01:27.833
since I saw you on Wednesday

01:27.917 --> 01:29.667
for the checkup
and the more blood work.

01:29.750 --> 01:31.541
Let me see if I...

01:31.625 --> 01:33.416
I don't want to
clog up your inbox

01:33.500 --> 01:35.249
with unnecessary stuff,
Dr. Blake,

01:35.333 --> 01:37.958
but I just want to
take a little moment
to thank you.

01:38.041 --> 01:39.750
Thank you, man,

01:39.833 --> 01:42.166
for taking me back on
as a patient.

01:42.249 --> 01:44.166
You know, it's funny,

01:44.249 --> 01:46.792
but after all these past
ten years or so

01:46.875 --> 01:50.625
of seeing all these
big-time specialists
for my condition,

01:50.708 --> 01:55.500
fuck... GPs, internists, um...

01:55.583 --> 01:58.375
dermatologists, psychiatrists,

01:58.458 --> 02:00.166
blah blah blah blah blah blah,

02:00.249 --> 02:03.166
it feels the most right
coming back to you, ya know?

02:03.249 --> 02:07.458
You've been treating me
since I'm five years old,
right? Is that it?

02:07.541 --> 02:09.999
Boy, you've always
been there for me.

02:11.583 --> 02:14.458
Even more so
than my parents sometimes.

02:14.541 --> 02:16.458
So...

02:16.541 --> 02:19.083
Well, enough of that, though.

02:19.166 --> 02:21.792
Enough of that. Enough of that.
No pity parties here.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.375
So here we go, yeah,
let's do this.

02:24.458 --> 02:26.625
Forty-eight hours, no clothes...

02:28.166 --> 02:30.667
no bad foods, no chemicals,

02:30.750 --> 02:32.999
just Craig.

02:33.083 --> 02:34.958
Away from my apartment
and my environment

02:35.041 --> 02:37.708
and anything that could
be causing a reaction.

02:39.667 --> 02:43.291
Yeah, so let's see
how we do this. OK?

02:43.375 --> 02:45.333
High-five, brother.

02:45.416 --> 02:47.208
Bye. I'll talk to you soon.
Thank you, bye.

02:48.541 --> 02:51.500
Hey, Dr. Blake.
Sorry to bug you again,

02:51.583 --> 02:54.333
but I wanted
to show you something
while I'm still in the bath.

02:54.416 --> 02:56.333
I've been continuing

02:56.416 --> 02:58.166
with the bleach baths,

02:58.249 --> 03:00.333
ya know, just a tablespoon,

03:00.416 --> 03:02.166
as they generally recommend.

03:02.249 --> 03:05.500
Just in case, to keep
everything sort of at bay,

03:05.583 --> 03:06.917
you know.

03:06.999 --> 03:09.833
And it's weird,
but I'm feeling, like,

03:09.917 --> 03:13.458
the rash is somehow reacting
to the bleach or something.

03:13.541 --> 03:15.833
Here, why don't I show you.
Look.

03:15.917 --> 03:20.999
It's almost like the rash,
like, bubbles up or something?

03:21.083 --> 03:22.583
I don't know.

03:22.667 --> 03:26.458
I just thought
I'd send it along,
just in case.

03:26.541 --> 03:29.667
I think when you've been
living with something
as long as I have,

03:29.750 --> 03:33.875
you start getting, um,
a little bit desperate
for a cure.

03:33.958 --> 03:36.291
So I figure, why not?

03:37.708 --> 03:41.583
This is crazy, but, um,
I'm just gonna say it.

03:41.667 --> 03:45.166
There's something
I haven't told you
that I feel like I should

03:45.249 --> 03:46.833
'cause I think it's important.

03:48.166 --> 03:52.999
A few years ago
when I was seeing my third...

03:53.083 --> 03:55.333
Third psychiatrist, shit...

03:55.416 --> 03:57.833
The German guy, yeah, um...

03:57.917 --> 04:00.999
I had this notion, this...

04:01.083 --> 04:04.124
It was very quiet,
it was from deep inside,

04:04.208 --> 04:08.249
and it was like a...
Like a feeling...

04:08.333 --> 04:12.208
like a bad feeling,
like there was something...

04:12.291 --> 04:14.333
really wrong with me.

04:15.583 --> 04:17.166
But...

04:19.916 --> 04:22.625
lately it's been coming back,
this...

04:22.708 --> 04:24.249
I don't know how to describe it,

04:24.333 --> 04:27.416
it's like, um, I feel like
something happened to me

04:27.500 --> 04:29.124
when I was young, maybe.

04:29.208 --> 04:33.416
Like a deep... physical
or emotional wound

04:33.500 --> 04:36.667
of some sort
that I've suppressed.

04:36.750 --> 04:40.333
And that maybe it's coming back
in the form of this rash?

04:42.333 --> 04:44.458
I don't know,

04:44.541 --> 04:47.333
it might be nothing, but...

04:47.416 --> 04:50.792
I guess when you're living
with something like this
for such a long time,

04:50.875 --> 04:52.999
you start getting
really desperate... you do...

04:53.083 --> 04:55.523
Looking for a cure,
and you hope that anything's
gonna crack...

04:57.375 --> 04:59.291
I already said that, didn't I?

04:59.375 --> 05:02.124
I'm so sorry, I promise
I'm gonna stop wasting
your time now,

05:02.208 --> 05:03.792
but I just wanted to check in.

05:03.875 --> 05:07.041
So I'll talk to you later.
Bye.

05:08.625 --> 05:11.625
Hey, Dr. Blake.
Just a quickie here.

05:11.708 --> 05:14.875
I realize I haven't given you
a sort of wider angle

05:14.958 --> 05:17.667
of my entire body, so I'm...

05:19.083 --> 05:20.583
so I thought I'd put it down
on video

05:20.667 --> 05:23.917
just for the sake
of thoroughness, I guess.

05:23.999 --> 05:25.875
Fuck. As you can see,

05:25.958 --> 05:28.541
it's still slowly, um,

05:28.625 --> 05:31.875
spreading and, you know,
doing its own thing,

05:31.958 --> 05:32.999
um...

05:34.249 --> 05:35.833
I'm trying not to freak out.

05:37.917 --> 05:39.197
And definitely I'm a little sad,

05:39.249 --> 05:42.041
a little scared too, but...

05:42.124 --> 05:43.667
I'm hopeful.

05:43.750 --> 05:46.625
I'm hopeful that you and I
are gonna beat this thing.

05:46.708 --> 05:48.708
We got this, right?

05:48.792 --> 05:51.083
So for tonight, I'm just gonna
get a good night's sleep

05:51.166 --> 05:52.917
and keep it on the positive,

05:52.999 --> 05:56.083
and we'll see what tomorrow
brings together...

05:56.166 --> 05:57.999
So...

05:58.083 --> 06:00.541
I'm sorry. I guess...

06:00.625 --> 06:03.792
you've seen everything already,
so you don't care.

06:03.875 --> 06:04.958
Bye, Dr. Blake.

06:06.917 --> 06:10.875
Boy. I'm so sorry,
I know it's late.

06:10.958 --> 06:13.416
Dr. Blake, I just
had a dream,

06:13.500 --> 06:16.875
and I think it's important,
I can feel it's important.

06:16.958 --> 06:21.500
It's like... I think it relates
to the rashes somehow,

06:21.583 --> 06:24.708
along the lines
of what I was talking about
in the bathtub before.

06:26.041 --> 06:28.291
My God, I don't know how to...

06:28.375 --> 06:30.708
It was like I was in this,
like, place,

06:30.792 --> 06:34.208
I was in this place, this...
This, like, dark,

06:34.291 --> 06:37.208
it was musty, like,
earthy-smellin' place,

06:37.291 --> 06:41.083
it was like a cave
or like a lair of some sort.

06:42.999 --> 06:46.875
Man, and it...
there were these beings
all around me, right?

06:46.958 --> 06:48.208
Like, I could feel them...

06:48.291 --> 06:50.458
I couldn't see anything,
it was dark,

06:50.541 --> 06:52.999
but I could hear them,
I could feel them.

06:53.083 --> 06:56.208
They weren't human,
they were more like animals

06:56.291 --> 06:59.124
or like ghosts
or something like...

07:02.375 --> 07:04.583
And I knew that they needed me.

07:04.667 --> 07:06.541
Like, I felt like they...

07:08.792 --> 07:11.333
like I was part of
some sort of plan or something.

07:14.750 --> 07:16.833
But I didn't feel safe.

07:16.917 --> 07:20.083
I... I felt like...

07:20.166 --> 07:22.958
Like they were gonna hurt me.

07:23.041 --> 07:25.541
They started closing in
and getting closer and closer,

07:25.625 --> 07:27.750
but I was... I was a little boy
in the dream,

07:27.833 --> 07:31.917
but... it was taking them
so long to, like, get close,

07:31.999 --> 07:35.083
yeah, it was like years,
it felt like... years,

07:35.166 --> 07:37.208
'cause I started growing up.

07:39.166 --> 07:40.667
Like, right there, I...

07:42.958 --> 07:45.833
And one of them was about
to step into a shaft of light,

07:45.917 --> 07:48.500
I could just feel him,
just... Bam! Fuck!

07:48.583 --> 07:51.667
I w... I woke up. You know?

07:53.750 --> 07:54.875
Holy...

07:57.416 --> 08:00.750
Dr. Blake,
something's happening.

08:00.833 --> 08:03.249
I can feel something
opening up inside of me,

08:03.333 --> 08:06.375
something that's like...

08:06.458 --> 08:07.958
Boy, this could be big?

08:08.041 --> 08:11.041
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna try to, ya know,

08:11.124 --> 08:15.124
try to go back to sleep,
see if I can... learn more,

08:15.208 --> 08:16.875
but, I...

08:18.333 --> 08:19.375
Good night.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.708
I'll check back in when...

08:23.249 --> 08:24.500
Hey, Dr. Blake.

08:24.583 --> 08:26.999
Man, so,
I couldn't go back to sleep,

08:27.083 --> 08:29.667
obviously, you know,
it's just doot-doot-doot-doot!

08:29.750 --> 08:32.582
But that's OK, that's OK,
'cause, um,

08:32.667 --> 08:36.917
I realized that this dream
must be reflecting something
real from my childhood.

08:36.999 --> 08:39.166
Something real, you know?
It's too vivid.

08:39.249 --> 08:42.041
So I'm gonna call my mom
and see what's up.

08:42.124 --> 08:43.792
Hello?

08:43.875 --> 08:45.958
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Mama! Hi!

08:46.041 --> 08:47.458
It's me, it's Craig.

08:47.541 --> 08:49.917
- <i>I know it's you, honey.</i>
- Good.

08:49.999 --> 08:51.792
Hey, listen, Mom, real quick,

08:51.875 --> 08:53.792
I wanted to ask you
a few questions,

08:53.875 --> 08:56.583
but before I get into all that,
I wanted you to know

08:56.667 --> 08:58.999
that I'm recording this
Facetime, OK?

08:59.083 --> 09:01.667
I'm gonna record you.
So, if that's OK with you.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.333
<i>Wait, what?
You're recording me?</i>

09:03.416 --> 09:04.583
Just the conversation,

09:04.667 --> 09:06.166
in case something
interesting pops up,

09:06.249 --> 09:07.708
for the questions,
for posterity,

09:07.792 --> 09:09.541
- is that OK with you?
- <i>OK, Craig, sure.</i>

09:09.625 --> 09:11.999
First question, OK?
And just answer,

09:12.083 --> 09:14.333
don't think about it too much,
just answer me, OK?

09:14.416 --> 09:19.375
Um... did you ever take me
somewhere that was dark
when I was a kid,

09:19.458 --> 09:24.041
like a... or earthy-smelling,
like a cave?

09:24.124 --> 09:26.041
Did you ever take me to a cave?

09:26.124 --> 09:28.434
- <i>What are you trying to ask?</i>
- I don't wanna say too much,

09:28.458 --> 09:30.458
'cause I don't wanna put
any answers in your mouth,

09:30.541 --> 09:34.083
but basically I'm wondering
if, um...

09:34.166 --> 09:36.875
if something happened to me
when I was a kid,

09:36.958 --> 09:39.208
if something weird happened
to me that you can remember,

09:39.291 --> 09:41.708
like, anything
out of the ordinary,

09:41.792 --> 09:45.124
I don't want to say threatening,

09:45.208 --> 09:48.500
but traumatizing,
something that you don't
want to tell me.

09:48.583 --> 09:50.166
<i>Craig, honey, I promised myself</i>

09:50.249 --> 09:51.769
<i>that I wouldn't argue with you
anymore.</i>

09:51.833 --> 09:53.375
- Then don't.
- <i>You spending</i>

09:53.458 --> 09:54.833
<i>all this time alone,</i>

09:54.917 --> 09:56.037
<i>thinking about this stuff...</i>

09:56.083 --> 09:57.999
<i>You know it's not good.</i>

09:58.083 --> 09:59.975
You know I'm not gonna stop
until I find the answer.

09:59.999 --> 10:01.750
- Right? I'm not gonna do that.
- <i>Yes.</i>

10:01.833 --> 10:03.809
OK? So can we just please
cut the routine and get to it?

10:03.833 --> 10:05.476
- Do you mind if we do that?
- <i>Sure, Craig. Sure.</i>

10:05.500 --> 10:06.500
Yeah, let's do it, OK?

10:06.541 --> 10:08.083
Great. Thank you, Mom.

10:08.166 --> 10:10.667
So, did we ever take a trip
or a vacation or something...

10:10.750 --> 10:12.708
<i>We never had money
for anything like that.</i>

10:12.792 --> 10:14.875
<i>We took a few small trips
to the lake,</i>

10:14.958 --> 10:16.958
<i>we would visit
your Aunt Marisol,</i>

10:17.041 --> 10:18.958
<i>we went camping once.</i>

10:19.041 --> 10:21.458
<i>We would visit the city
to look at colleges
for your sister.</i>

10:21.541 --> 10:23.083
Wait, what was that?
What'd you say?

10:23.166 --> 10:24.667
- <i>What?</i>
- You said a camping trip?

10:24.750 --> 10:26.083
I don't remember a camping trip.

10:26.166 --> 10:27.667
<i>Of course you remember
that trip.</i>

10:27.750 --> 10:29.684
No, I don't remember
a camping trip. Why would I...

10:29.708 --> 10:31.625
<i>Craig, we've talked
about this before.</i>

10:31.708 --> 10:33.291
Mom, we haven't talked about it.

10:33.375 --> 10:35.625
H-How old was I?

10:35.708 --> 10:37.708
<i>I don't know.
Maybe four or five?</i>

10:37.792 --> 10:39.667
So I was little. OK. OK.

10:39.750 --> 10:42.917
Um... Jesus, I don't remember
any of this.

10:42.999 --> 10:45.166
<i>OK, maybe I talked
to Jenny about it.</i>

10:45.249 --> 10:46.708
No, it's fine, doesn't matter.

10:46.792 --> 10:48.458
Just tell me more about it.
Tell me more.

10:48.541 --> 10:51.458
<i>Well, your father and I,
we were...</i>

10:51.541 --> 10:53.958
<i>We weren't having
our best times then.</i>

10:54.041 --> 10:55.625
<i>I was very distracted.</i>

10:55.708 --> 10:57.416
You were distracted. OK.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.124
<i>And, um, Jenny made a friend</i>

10:59.208 --> 11:01.249
<i>and ended up staying the night
in their tent.</i>

11:01.333 --> 11:04.249
So Jenny was...
That's interesting.
That's good.

11:04.333 --> 11:05.792
<i>Let's see.</i>

11:05.875 --> 11:09.667
<i>Your father and I,
we got into a fight, and I...</i>

11:09.750 --> 11:13.124
<i>Well, one of us yelled,
and I was worried,</i>

11:13.208 --> 11:15.208
<i>because I was worried that
you might have heard us,</i>

11:15.249 --> 11:17.249
<i>'cause you were in
the tent next to us, alone.</i>

11:17.333 --> 11:20.667
OK, so wait. So I was alone
and Jenny was gone.

11:20.750 --> 11:22.416
- Is that right?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

11:22.500 --> 11:25.333
<i>And actually, I forgot
all about this part</i>

11:25.416 --> 11:27.291
<i>until you mentioned it.</i>

11:27.375 --> 11:30.208
<i>I came back to the tent
to check on you,</i>

11:30.291 --> 11:32.375
<i>and you weren't in the tent.</i>

11:34.917 --> 11:36.809
What does that mean?
What do you mean? I wasn't...

11:36.833 --> 11:39.416
<i>Now I remember it. I got scared
'cause you were gone.</i>

11:39.500 --> 11:41.333
<i>I remember that. And...</i>

11:41.416 --> 11:43.667
- I was gone?
- <i>Yeah. I got your father,</i>

11:43.750 --> 11:46.190
<i>and we got our flashlights,
and we looked all around
for you...</i>

11:46.249 --> 11:49.049
- So I was gone-gone.
- <i>Yeah, you were gone,</i>
<i>and we couldn't find you...</i>

11:49.083 --> 11:51.041
- How was it that...
- <i>We were really scared,</i>

11:51.124 --> 11:54.583
<i>'cause it was a small site,
surrounded by big woods...</i>

11:54.667 --> 11:56.601
- Whoa, who, whoa, Mom...
- <i>You couldn't have gone far.</i>

11:56.625 --> 11:58.708
How is it that you're just
remembering this now?

11:58.792 --> 12:00.375
- This is a huge deal!
- <i>I don't know.</i>

12:00.458 --> 12:01.958
I was gone? I disappeared
as a kid?

12:02.041 --> 12:03.625
<i>I haven't thought about this
in years.</i>

12:03.708 --> 12:05.500
<i>A lot of things
have happened to me,</i>

12:05.583 --> 12:08.208
<i>I don't obsess over every
single one of them like you do.</i>

12:08.291 --> 12:11.541
It's OK. Just stay with me.
This is good, Mom.

12:11.625 --> 12:13.333
What happened next?

12:14.625 --> 12:16.375
- What happened?
- <i>I guess, well,</i>

12:16.458 --> 12:18.875
<i>I... I think you... you were...</i>

12:18.958 --> 12:21.667
<i>We couldn't find you,
and... and then we did.</i>

12:21.750 --> 12:24.291
W-What do you mean?
Where'd you find me?

12:24.375 --> 12:26.541
<i>I don't know!
We looked around,
you weren't there.</i>

12:26.625 --> 12:28.958
<i>We came back to the tent,
you were back.</i>

12:30.625 --> 12:33.458
- Did I say where I was?
- <i>No.</i>

12:33.541 --> 12:35.792
Did you ask me?
Did you bother to ask me?

12:35.875 --> 12:37.500
<i>I don't remember. It was late.</i>

12:37.583 --> 12:39.541
<i>Your father and I were fighting,</i>

12:39.625 --> 12:41.375
<i>we just went back to bed.</i>

12:41.458 --> 12:43.750
OK, OK. Wow.

12:43.833 --> 12:47.458
Wow, OK. W-What else?
Anything else?

12:47.541 --> 12:49.208
<i>No. Nothing. That was it.</i>

12:49.291 --> 12:50.792
- Just...
- <i>I... I'm coming!</i>

12:50.875 --> 12:52.875
- No, Mom, listen.
- <i>Listen, honey, I gotta run.</i>

12:52.958 --> 12:55.667
Please, please, before you go,
what's the name of the place?

12:55.750 --> 12:57.267
- Do you have the name?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

12:57.291 --> 12:59.166
<i>It's probably closed down now.</i>

12:59.249 --> 13:00.833
<i>It was one of
those stupid places</i>

13:00.917 --> 13:02.750
<i>that were popular in the '80s</i>

13:02.833 --> 13:05.166
<i>when everybody
was all into aliens.</i>

13:07.708 --> 13:08.708
<i>What?</i>

13:08.792 --> 13:10.625
A-Aliens.

13:10.708 --> 13:12.416
<i>Yeah, you remember.</i>

13:12.500 --> 13:15.041
<i>It was right around the time</i>
E.T. <i>came out.</i>

13:15.124 --> 13:19.291
<i>All these places sprung up
advertising that you could see
flying saucers</i>

13:19.375 --> 13:21.500
<i>from their campgrounds
and stuff.</i>

13:21.583 --> 13:23.333
What's the name
of the city, Mom?

13:23.416 --> 13:25.100
- <i>I don't know...
- What's the name of the city?</i>

13:25.124 --> 13:27.917
- <i>Calm down. Calm down.</i>
- No. Tell me. State.

13:27.999 --> 13:30.041
Do you remember the state?
Give me information, Mom!

13:30.124 --> 13:31.625
<i>Oregon.
Somewhere around there.</i>

13:31.708 --> 13:33.625
- Oregon? Where in Oregon?
- <i>Southern Oregon.</i>

13:33.708 --> 13:35.548
- Southern Oregon?!
- <i>Over there! I don't know!</i>

13:35.625 --> 13:37.625
Great! Great! This is good, Mom!

13:37.708 --> 13:40.958
This is great! Thank you!
Thank you so much!

13:41.041 --> 13:43.708
Thank you, Mom.

13:45.333 --> 13:46.667
Holy...

13:51.917 --> 13:55.375
I gotta... Please excuse me,
Dr. Blake, I gotta...

13:57.041 --> 13:59.166
I gotta go. It...

13:59.249 --> 14:00.750
Ho ho! Wow.

14:02.458 --> 14:04.500
Hi, Dr. Blake.

14:06.667 --> 14:09.375
I think I found the place.
I think so.

14:09.458 --> 14:11.792
It's got the most consistent
craft sightings

14:11.875 --> 14:13.333
in the continental U.S.,

14:13.416 --> 14:15.750
and I was there during
the most popular time, right?

14:15.833 --> 14:17.124
And that's when I disappeared

14:17.208 --> 14:19.208
and suddenly, mysteriously
popped back up?

14:19.291 --> 14:21.875
Ya know? What? Right?

14:23.249 --> 14:24.999
This is insane.

14:25.083 --> 14:27.500
This is insane, but, um,

14:27.583 --> 14:31.625
I feel that... after all
the tests I've been through

14:31.708 --> 14:33.708
and all the research I've done,

14:33.792 --> 14:36.750
the most insane answer
I think is the correct one.

14:36.833 --> 14:38.124
Ya know?

14:40.833 --> 14:43.375
I was abducted by aliens.

14:43.458 --> 14:45.875
And something happened. -

14:45.958 --> 14:48.708
I don't know what, I...
And this cave from my dreams

14:48.792 --> 14:51.792
is very clearly
a suppressed memory.

14:51.875 --> 14:54.249
You see? It was a real memory.

14:54.333 --> 14:56.208
It was making its way
back to me,

14:56.291 --> 14:59.249
first in the form of
all those little illnesses
when I was a kid,

14:59.333 --> 15:01.083
and then for the past
eight years

15:01.166 --> 15:04.958
in the form of this...
The form of this rash.

15:08.792 --> 15:12.041
I can feel it
just lifting out of me, man,

15:12.124 --> 15:14.333
this... this darkness
inside of me, it just...

15:14.416 --> 15:17.208
As soon as I got it,
it was just like...

15:17.291 --> 15:20.083
And it's only been an hour,
but look.

15:20.166 --> 15:22.583
Look. Look!

15:22.667 --> 15:25.166
I swear, I think
it's already clearing up.

15:25.249 --> 15:26.917
I swear.

15:26.999 --> 15:29.375
I think I just needed
to face it.

15:29.458 --> 15:33.083
Yeah, to... to like transcend
whatever experience it was

15:33.166 --> 15:35.333
and to say it out loud, to say,

15:35.416 --> 15:39.458
yes, I was abducted
by aliens, and maybe...

15:39.541 --> 15:43.416
maybe I was probed or... ha!
Traumatized or whatever it was,

15:43.500 --> 15:46.083
but I don't care,
I forgive you, you know?

15:46.166 --> 15:47.833
I...

15:47.917 --> 15:50.917
I forgive you!
And I'm moving past it!

15:50.999 --> 15:52.500
OK?

15:54.208 --> 15:57.583
I'm ready to begin my life
again, man, my...

15:57.667 --> 16:00.625
normal, just like pain-free,

16:00.708 --> 16:04.875
rash-free, super regular
sort of life, you know?

16:04.958 --> 16:08.625
I just feel like living again.

16:08.708 --> 16:11.667
I want to enjoy myself.
I want to...

16:11.750 --> 16:14.667
I want to dance,
is what I want to do!

16:14.750 --> 16:16.833
Wait. I... I got this.

16:19.541 --> 16:21.541
Let me find a good...

16:21.625 --> 16:24.291
OK. Here it is. Ready?

16:27.249 --> 16:29.541
- I love this song, man!

16:29.625 --> 16:31.583
Dr. Blake,

16:31.667 --> 16:34.291
I wish you were here with me
to celebrate, you know?

16:34.375 --> 16:36.291
It's been such a long journey,

16:36.375 --> 16:39.124
and you've been
right there with me
every step of the way, man.

16:39.208 --> 16:41.166
You're my partner,
you know that?

16:41.249 --> 16:42.500
You're my dance partner!

16:42.583 --> 16:45.041
Ha! I'll go! Go, Dr. Blake!

16:45.124 --> 16:47.208
Whoo!

17:20.666 --> 17:22.083
Yeah.

17:50.667 --> 17:53.124
Hey, Dr. Blake.

17:53.208 --> 17:55.541
As you can see, the rash
has progressed more quickly

17:55.625 --> 17:58.208
and more painfully
than it ever has.

17:58.291 --> 18:01.708
- I don't know why.
- Fuck.

18:01.792 --> 18:04.625
Didn't change anything
differently, I didn't...

18:06.208 --> 18:08.500
I didn't do anything
differently, I just went to bed,

18:08.583 --> 18:13.124
I went to bed...
excited about the new stage,

18:13.208 --> 18:17.583
and I woke up a few hours later
with this shit. This.

18:17.667 --> 18:20.124
I'm upset, you know?

18:20.208 --> 18:21.917
And I'm gonna let myself
be upset,

18:21.999 --> 18:24.208
and I'm gonna forget
about the...

18:24.291 --> 18:26.249
being-positive thing
for just a second,

18:26.333 --> 18:28.750
because I...

18:28.833 --> 18:31.500
I think I need
to go on instinct.

18:31.583 --> 18:34.041
I think I need to go bigger.

18:34.124 --> 18:36.500
And my instinct
is saying "bleach."

18:38.500 --> 18:40.249
And that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

18:40.333 --> 18:44.625
It's like that Malcolm Gladwell
thing "Blink" he talks about.

18:44.708 --> 18:47.458
I'm blinking on bleach,
Dr. Blake.

18:49.750 --> 18:51.583
So I'm gonna go bigger,

18:51.667 --> 18:54.833
'cause this situation
is just not sustainable,
it's just not.

18:54.917 --> 18:56.541
It's not.

18:59.416 --> 19:00.958
Yeah.

19:01.041 --> 19:03.667
Let's go big on bleach.

19:03.750 --> 19:05.375
See what happens.

20:21.291 --> 20:23.625
Dr. Blake, um...

20:31.833 --> 20:35.333
I think I'm... I'm coming
to the end of something here.

20:43.166 --> 20:45.458
My God, I think
I'm going insane.

20:53.333 --> 20:56.416
Thank you...
for everything,

20:56.500 --> 20:58.708
'cause you've been wonderful.

21:02.875 --> 21:04.500
But I'm done.

21:11.333 --> 21:12.999
I'm done.

21:19.667 --> 21:21.333
Hey, Dr. Blake.

21:23.667 --> 21:27.500
Um, I don't know how
to start saying what
I have to say to you,

21:27.583 --> 21:31.166
but, um, I'm just
gonna jump right into it.

21:33.041 --> 21:36.083
I went out for a last meal...

21:36.166 --> 21:38.833
and I ate all the things
I'm not supposed to eat,
all of 'em.

21:38.917 --> 21:40.875
It was delicious.

21:40.958 --> 21:43.708
No, seriously, it was so good.

21:43.792 --> 21:45.083
So good.

21:46.917 --> 21:51.917
Then I went
to a hardware store...

21:51.999 --> 21:54.208
and I bought myself some rope.

21:56.291 --> 21:59.917
A lot of supporting devices,
too.

21:59.999 --> 22:03.208
And I had every intention
of hanging myself this morning.

22:05.708 --> 22:08.249
The funny thing is,
I didn't bring my phone

22:08.333 --> 22:10.667
on this little
adventure of mine.

22:10.750 --> 22:12.792
It's so silly,

22:12.875 --> 22:16.166
but the little things
don't really matter
when you're about to die,

22:16.249 --> 22:18.541
and I just didn't even
think about it.

22:19.625 --> 22:21.458
But when I got to my hotel,

22:21.541 --> 22:24.500
I, um, had a message on my phone

22:24.583 --> 22:26.500
from somebody
very special to me.

22:26.583 --> 22:28.583
Very special.

22:28.667 --> 22:31.249
And I wanna play that for you,
if that's OK.

22:38.833 --> 22:40.416
<i>Hello, Craig?</i>

22:40.500 --> 22:42.124
<i>This is Dr. Blake.</i>

22:42.208 --> 22:44.333
<i>I just received
all your messages.</i>

22:44.416 --> 22:46.833
<i>I apologize for not
getting back to you sooner.</i>

22:46.917 --> 22:49.999
<i>I've been trying to carve
the weekends for the grandkids.</i>

22:50.083 --> 22:52.208
<i>I love my babies.</i>

22:52.291 --> 22:55.166
<i>Anyhow,
I tried calling a few times
and you didn't pick up,</i>

22:55.249 --> 22:57.541
<i>so I'm leaving you
this message now.</i>

22:57.625 --> 23:00.750
<i>And I'm sure you can hear
the excitement in my voice,</i>

23:00.833 --> 23:02.833
<i>so I'm hoping this message
catches you</i>

23:02.917 --> 23:04.958
<i>before you do anything "rash."</i>

23:07.124 --> 23:08.924
<i>I know this has been
a difficult time for you,</i>

23:08.958 --> 23:11.792
<i>so let's end it right now,
shall we?</i>

23:11.875 --> 23:14.166
<i>I have just received
your blood work.</i>

23:14.249 --> 23:16.166
<i>You have an official diagnosis.</i>

23:16.249 --> 23:18.792
<i>You have
an extremely rare disease</i>

23:18.875 --> 23:20.999
<i>called Hertzinger's Syndrome.</i>

23:21.083 --> 23:24.375
<i>It is first presented
as a weakened immune system,</i>

23:24.458 --> 23:26.166
<i>i.e., your childhood,</i>

23:26.249 --> 23:29.124
<i>and if not caught,
it often progresses</i>

23:29.208 --> 23:31.083
<i>into a thickening of the blood</i>

23:31.166 --> 23:35.208
<i>and presents in a form of
small, oddly shaped rashes</i>

23:35.291 --> 23:38.541
<i>that can cover the entire body
in extreme cases.</i>

23:38.625 --> 23:42.249
<i>The bad news is,
if I had caught this
when you were younger,</i>

23:42.333 --> 23:46.541
<i>I could have saved you
years of suffering
and frustration.</i>

23:46.625 --> 23:50.166
<i>I apologize to you
from the depths of my soul
for that error.</i>

23:50.249 --> 23:51.750
It's OK. It's OK.

23:51.833 --> 23:54.458
<i>I know I cannot give you
those years back.</i>

23:54.541 --> 23:58.750
<i>The good news is, this disease
is 100% curable.</i>

23:58.833 --> 24:00.917
<i>You will receive three shots,</i>

24:00.999 --> 24:03.083
<i>a series of blood transfusions,</i>

24:03.166 --> 24:06.416
<i>and a rather stiff
90-day antibiotic treatment.</i>

24:06.500 --> 24:08.416
<i>Your symptoms</i>

24:08.500 --> 24:11.500
<i>will start to dissipate
within a week.</i>

24:11.583 --> 24:14.208
<i>It is 6:15 a.m. my time.</i>

24:14.291 --> 24:15.999
<i>By the time you receive this,</i>

24:16.083 --> 24:18.166
<i>I will be on the road
to your hotel room,</i>

24:18.249 --> 24:20.083
<i>the one we discussed.</i>

24:20.166 --> 24:22.124
<i>Room 104, was it?</i>

24:22.208 --> 24:24.249
<i>I will administer
the first of the shots</i>

24:24.333 --> 24:26.958
<i>and I will have the antibiotic
treatment with me.</i>

24:27.041 --> 24:30.166
<i>We'll start your blood
transfusions later today.</i>

24:30.249 --> 24:33.458
<i>I figured,
why waste any more time?</i>

24:33.541 --> 24:35.124
<i>One last thing.</i>

24:35.208 --> 24:37.999
<i>I was very concerned
about your last video,</i>

24:38.083 --> 24:41.792
<i>and it's very important
that you don't lose hope.</i>

24:41.875 --> 24:46.416
<i>I'm very proud of you
for holding on all these years.</i>

24:46.500 --> 24:49.083
<i>Your life has had
a greater impact</i>

24:49.166 --> 24:50.917
<i>than you will ever know.</i>

24:50.999 --> 24:52.792
<i>You're very special.</i>

24:58.375 --> 25:00.458
Dr. Blake?

25:00.541 --> 25:01.875
<i>It's me!</i>

25:12.750 --> 25:15.625
Yes, yes, it's time.

25:15.708 --> 25:17.792
It's definitely time.

25:20.249 --> 25:21.999
<i>Come. Come.</i>

25:22.083 --> 25:23.458
<i>Lie down.</i>

25:43.249 --> 25:45.708
Now, this is
the first of the shots.

25:45.792 --> 25:46.708
OK.

25:46.792 --> 25:48.667
I warn you, it will be painful.

25:48.750 --> 25:51.041
- That's OK.
- Your body will feel like

25:51.124 --> 25:53.333
it's fighting the medication.

25:53.416 --> 25:56.291
But just think:
quite soon,

25:56.375 --> 25:59.375
you won't have to deal
with any of this anymore, OK?

25:59.458 --> 26:01.416
OK, Dr. Blake.

26:03.792 --> 26:07.667
That's good. Good boy.

26:08.792 --> 26:09.792
I...

26:12.999 --> 26:15.333
That wasn't too bad.

26:21.333 --> 26:22.416
Dr. Blake...

26:43.500 --> 26:46.416
I want to thank you...

26:46.500 --> 26:48.833
for taking care
of my babies for me.

27:15.208 --> 27:18.833
I have been waiting...

27:18.917 --> 27:24.583
a long... time...

27:24.667 --> 27:27.166
to see you.

27:35.208 --> 27:38.999
Almost 35 years.

27:44.208 --> 27:46.375
Say, "Bye-bye, Daddy."

29:24.958 --> 29:27.333
<i>Lemonade.
Country ice.</i>

29:28.124 --> 29:29.375
<i>Hit them once.</i>

29:30.249 --> 29:31.708
<i>Hit them twice.</i>

29:31.792 --> 29:34.333
<i>Hit them at the bottom.
Hit them at the top.</i>

29:34.750 --> 29:38.792
<i>Hit at the middle
and watch them drop.</i>
