00:01.960 --> 00:04.640
Your mum would've been so proud
seeing you look so grown up.

00:05.960 --> 00:06.960
So, so proud.

00:09.960 --> 00:10.960
She knew you were special.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.960
And this week,
it's time to show the world, too.

00:21.960 --> 00:22.960
THEY CACKLE

00:22.960 --> 00:24.480
Oh, my God!

00:24.480 --> 00:25.960
What the fuck's that?

00:25.960 --> 00:27.960
Look at the state of this muppet!

00:27.960 --> 00:32.800
Presenting Christopher Boniface
Sixtus the Great Bellend!

00:32.800 --> 00:33.960
Whoo!
LAUGHTER

00:33.960 --> 00:34.960
I'm not gonna lie.

00:34.960 --> 00:38.160
You look like you're off
to buy some slaves, lad. Oh, sir!

00:38.160 --> 00:40.960
Me shine shoes, sir.

00:40.960 --> 00:42.960
I qualified brain surgeon,

00:42.960 --> 00:45.960
but Rishi say I need two jobs
or they send me to Rwanda.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.960
Please tell them
this my second job, sir.

00:47.960 --> 00:48.960
Please! Please!

00:51.960 --> 00:52.960
Come 'ead.

00:52.960 --> 00:54.960
It's careers week, boys.

00:54.960 --> 00:56.320
This could be the first step
to the job

00:56.320 --> 00:57.960
you're gonna do
for the rest of your lives.

00:57.960 --> 01:00.960
Kind of important, don't you think?
Why?

01:00.960 --> 01:03.960
Why? Because your job
gives you your purpose.

01:03.960 --> 01:04.960
It's a part of your identity.

01:04.960 --> 01:08.320
Lad, we're not like you.
We don't think you job defines you.

01:08.320 --> 01:09.960
TED GASPS
There's Maccies Mike!

01:09.960 --> 01:11.640
Oi! Mike!

01:11.640 --> 01:13.960
Do us a Big Mac, you sweaty gherkin!

01:13.960 --> 01:14.960
Ha-ha-ha!

01:14.960 --> 01:17.960

01:17.960 --> 01:20.960
♪ He shags gherkins! ♪

01:20.960 --> 01:21.960
THEY LAUGH

01:21.960 --> 01:24.960
See you Friday, la!

01:24.960 --> 01:28.960
Look, I don't need any muppets
telling me what to do with my life.

01:28.960 --> 01:32.960
I'm sorted. I'm starting a joinery
apprenticeship soon as, lad.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.960
Yeah, Philibert, think about it.

01:34.960 --> 01:36.960
How many doors are there
in the world?

01:36.960 --> 01:37.960
There's always work.

01:37.960 --> 01:40.960
And you can work in every country,
because every country needs doors.

01:40.960 --> 01:43.160
Doesn't matter how many doors
there are, you know, Reece.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.960
You'll never open one
to find your dad.

CACKLES

01:55.960 --> 01:56.960
God, look at him.

01:56.960 --> 01:58.640
Has he got no shame?

01:58.640 --> 02:00.960
Hacks your TikTok
and then just runs around laughing.

02:00.960 --> 02:02.960
God, is there any point
in this school

02:02.960 --> 02:03.960
even having a careers week

02:03.960 --> 02:05.960
when it's full of no-hope scruffs
like him? Ha!

02:05.960 --> 02:08.960
Imagine employers, like,
actually looking at their CVs.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.800
Lewis Connolly.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.960
national record
for most wanks in a day

02:15.960 --> 02:16.960
and most scraps in a day.

02:16.960 --> 02:20.960
Wow. Hobbies:
hacking me best mate's TikTok. Eeh.

02:20.960 --> 02:22.320
Straighteners.
Aw, me ideal straightener

02:22.320 --> 02:24.960
would defo be Vladimir Putin,
and saying,

02:24.960 --> 02:27.160
"I'm not racist, lad, but..."

02:27.160 --> 02:28.960
THEY LAUGH
Let me do one.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.960
Erm... yeah, him.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.960
Name? Mo Fassi.

02:33.960 --> 02:36.960
Achievements?
Erm, I can put my Goodfella's pizza

02:36.960 --> 02:39.960
in the oven all by myself,
without me ma's help.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.160
Hobbies? Staying up till 3am

02:41.160 --> 02:43.960
watching some fella on YouTube
rate fried chicken.

02:43.960 --> 02:46.640
THEY LAUGH

02:46.640 --> 02:48.960
Anyways, girl, get you arse here.
It's a big week for you.

02:48.960 --> 02:52.640
'What are you doing?'
Er, I'm just doin' me nails.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.960
I'll be there in a bit.

02:53.960 --> 02:55.960
'All right, love,
I'll see you soon.'

03:01.960 --> 03:02.960
Dad.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.960
Dad!
HE SNORES

03:09.960 --> 03:11.160
I swear, I wasn't there!

03:11.160 --> 03:12.960
Is it fair to say, Mr Duffy,

03:12.960 --> 03:14.960
that you frequent that area
most evenings?

03:14.960 --> 03:16.960
Yeah, but I wasn't there
that evening.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.960
Is it correct, Mr Duffy, that your
previous conviction was for theft?

03:19.960 --> 03:23.960
That was the biggest mistake
of me life, and I paid the price.

03:23.960 --> 03:25.960
I don't even get to see
me kids any more.

03:25.960 --> 03:27.640
HE SOBS

03:27.640 --> 03:31.960
Oh, I'm sorry, Reece,
I didn't mean to hit a raw nerve.

03:31.960 --> 03:33.320
LAUGHTER

03:33.320 --> 03:35.320
OK. Very clever.

03:35.320 --> 03:37.960
That was an example
of a cross-examination.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.640
My name's Lorna, I'm a barrister,

03:40.640 --> 03:42.960
and I think it's great you're
all getting enthused about law

03:42.960 --> 03:45.960
as this week,
we'll be staging a mock trial,

03:45.960 --> 03:48.800
and my chambers would like to offer
a mini-pupillage

03:48.800 --> 03:50.960
to the student
that shows the most potential

03:50.960 --> 03:52.960
for a career
in the legal profession.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.320
What's a mini-pupillage?

03:54.320 --> 03:56.960
Connor's nickname for his tiny cock.
LAUGHTER

03:56.960 --> 04:00.320
It's a short
work experience placement

04:00.320 --> 04:02.960
where you'll shadow myself
and attend court hearings.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.160
You should defo pick me, Miss,

04:04.160 --> 04:06.800
cos I am dead good
at just looking at someone

04:06.800 --> 04:08.640
and knowing whether they're a perv.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.160
You wouldn't even need
to take it to trial.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.960
I'll bear that in mind.
Thank you...?

04:12.960 --> 04:13.960
Mia-Louise Turner.

04:13.960 --> 04:15.960
Thank you, Mia-Louise.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.960
OK, I have your answers here

04:17.960 --> 04:19.960
to the legal question
we posed last week.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.960
Barry has been charged
with manslaughter

04:22.960 --> 04:24.960
after an altercation
with his friend Terry

04:24.960 --> 04:27.960
ended with Terry falling
and striking his head,

04:27.960 --> 04:28.960
causing his death.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.320
How would you advise Barry?

04:30.320 --> 04:32.960
A lot of you gave general advice
to Barry,

04:32.960 --> 04:34.160
when the question
meant legal advice.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.960
"Change your name.
Nobody's called Barry any more."

04:36.960 --> 04:38.960
"I heard it was a sex game
gone wrong."

04:38.960 --> 04:39.960
LAUGHTER

04:39.960 --> 04:41.640
"Have you got
Terry's missus' number?

04:41.640 --> 04:43.960
"She's on the market,
and I heard she's a stunner."

04:43.960 --> 04:47.160
But me two favourite answers
were Christopher,

04:47.160 --> 04:50.960
who advised, "He should plead guilty
to involuntary manslaughter

04:50.960 --> 04:52.960
"for a reduced sentence,"

04:52.960 --> 04:55.960
and Reece, who took
a more unorthodox approach

04:55.960 --> 04:58.800
and said, "Bazza should say
he was sleepwalking."

04:58.800 --> 04:59.960
I got the idea
when Connor stayed at mine.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.960
I punched him in the head
in the night

05:01.960 --> 05:03.320
and said I was sleepwalking.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.960
He believed me! Classic automatism.

05:05.960 --> 05:07.960
Very good, Reece.

05:07.960 --> 05:11.000
Automatism is indeed
a valid legal defence.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.960
So, well done to Christopher,

05:12.960 --> 05:14.800
who will be
the prosecuting barrister,

05:14.800 --> 05:16.960
and Reece, who will defend.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.960
This is the mock trial we'll be
getting our teeth into...

05:21.960 --> 05:23.960
Er, Miss? Are you messing?

05:23.960 --> 05:26.160
Who cares whether Benjamin
had his bike stolen?

05:26.160 --> 05:28.960
He's about 30
and still wearing those shorts?

05:28.960 --> 05:30.000
Nonce territory, that, Miss.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.960
Yeah, can't we do something
more interesting, like?

05:32.960 --> 05:35.960
We should trial Lewis
for hacking Aimee's TikTok

05:35.960 --> 05:37.960
and posting a video
slagging off girls in the school,

05:37.960 --> 05:39.960
so everyone thinks she posted it.

05:39.960 --> 05:42.960
Freya Moore's dad is in prison,

05:42.960 --> 05:44.960
and her mum is a drunkard crackhead,

05:44.960 --> 05:48.960
but the most tragic thing about her
is still that shocking unibrow.

05:48.960 --> 05:51.800
And he's still denying it, the rat.
CLAMOUR

05:51.800 --> 05:53.960
All right, that.
He's bang out of order.

05:53.960 --> 05:54.960
OK, OK.

05:54.960 --> 05:58.800
This is clearly a passionate issue
dear to all your hearts.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.960
Let's do it.
Lewis is in the mud!

06:01.960 --> 06:02.960
Mudded!

06:02.960 --> 06:05.000
CHEERING

06:10.960 --> 06:12.640
Wealth.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.960
What does it do?

06:14.960 --> 06:16.960
Does wealth define dreams?

06:16.960 --> 06:19.960
Or do dreams define wealth?

06:19.960 --> 06:22.640
This door won't open.

06:22.640 --> 06:23.960
It's locked!

06:23.960 --> 06:26.960
Inequality within
the acting profession.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.960
Glass ceiling?

06:29.960 --> 06:32.800
Don't you mean class ceiling?

06:33.960 --> 06:35.960
Eeh.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.960
Oh, I'm a bellend.

06:37.960 --> 06:40.960
Don't you mean,
I'm a complete bellend?

06:40.960 --> 06:42.960
APPLAUSE

06:45.320 --> 06:49.960
That was a little piece that I wrote
about how access and success

06:49.960 --> 06:51.960
within the British acting profession

06:51.960 --> 06:56.320
is increasingly dominated by those
from privileged class origins.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.960
But I wanna change that.

06:57.960 --> 07:02.960
I wanna show you
how to unlock that door.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.960
Yeah? I just wanna say,
I loved your use of stage proxemics.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.800
It really helped emphasise
the points of tension.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.960
Thank you very much.
What's your name?

07:10.960 --> 07:11.960
Grace.

07:11.960 --> 07:15.800
In Greek mythology, it means charm,
beauty and fertility.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.000
Well, you're obviously a very
knowledgeable young lady, Grace.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.960
Thanks.
I go to an evening drama school,

07:20.960 --> 07:22.960
and we cover a lot
of the techniques there.

07:22.960 --> 07:23.960
Fantastic.

07:23.960 --> 07:28.960
So, who else, like our Grace here,
has the drive to become an actor?

07:28.960 --> 07:32.480
Me. My dream is to become
the first person from Merseyside

07:32.480 --> 07:35.960
to win an Oscar
since Glenda Jackson in 1973.

07:35.960 --> 07:36.960
LAUGHTER

07:36.960 --> 07:40.960
Eeh, why are youse laughing?
Eh, it's called ambition.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.800
Yeah, but you also need hard work

07:42.800 --> 07:44.960
to go along
with that blind ambition.

07:44.960 --> 07:47.960
So, what do you do
to really push yourself?

07:47.960 --> 07:49.960
I do drama GCSE.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.480
Well, if you really want that Oscar,

07:52.480 --> 07:54.960
maybe you should be doing more,
like our Grace here.

07:54.960 --> 07:59.320
So, the school has asked me to do
an acting masterclass this week,

07:59.320 --> 08:02.960
but I'm also casting
for an indie film project

08:02.960 --> 08:05.960
about young, working-class kids
growing up in Liverpool.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.960
But I thought you
were a fancy film director?

08:07.960 --> 08:09.960
No, I'm a casting director,

08:09.960 --> 08:12.640
so I choose the right actors
for the films.

08:12.640 --> 08:13.960
Oh, that sounds easy, that.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.480
"You, you're good. Be in that."

08:16.480 --> 08:18.960
I want to cast
the female lead locally,

08:18.960 --> 08:21.960
so I'll be visiting a few schools
over the next few weeks,

08:21.960 --> 08:25.160
and I'll invite the best
from each school to a casting day.

08:25.160 --> 08:27.960
Why don't you just be
a real director instead?

08:27.960 --> 08:30.960
Er, it's not exactly as easy
as all that.

08:30.960 --> 08:31.960
So, if you're interested,

08:31.960 --> 08:34.960
auditions will be held
Wednesday afternoon.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.960
Let's get rehearsing!

08:36.960 --> 08:38.960
What are you having a go at him for?
Come on, it was funny.

08:38.960 --> 08:42.960
You do realise he's gonna cast
someone for an actual film?

08:42.960 --> 08:43.960
It would kinda help if he liked me.

08:43.960 --> 08:45.960
All right, well,
what's got into you?

08:45.960 --> 08:47.960
And why did you say
about putting Lewis on trial?

08:47.960 --> 08:49.960
Er, what do you mean?
I was trying to help you!

08:49.960 --> 08:52.960
Rehearsals are where
the real hard work happens.

08:52.960 --> 08:56.960
They'll either darken
your performance or...

08:56.960 --> 08:57.960
light it up.

09:02.960 --> 09:06.640
Good luck, my learned friend!
Me name's Reece, mate, not Leonard.

09:06.640 --> 09:07.960
May the best man win.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.480
May the man with
the poshest voice win, you mean.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.960
Oh, come on!
You belong in the courtroom too.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.960
Putting in the doors!
LAUGHS

09:14.960 --> 09:16.960
Lad, you're obsessed, you,
aren't you?

09:16.960 --> 09:18.480
Don't get so busy making a living

09:18.480 --> 09:20.160
that you forget to live your life, yeah?

09:22.000 --> 09:23.960
See you in court!

09:23.960 --> 09:25.960
'Black Betty'
by Ram Jam

09:27.960 --> 09:29.960
I'm gonna cross-examine
these bad boys.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.960
SNIFFS

09:40.000 --> 09:41.960
Yeah, that's the one! That's it.

09:41.960 --> 09:43.960
That's it. That is it, lad.
DOOR OPENS

09:43.960 --> 09:45.960
Seriously, Reece?

09:49.960 --> 09:51.960
'Are you messing, lad?'

09:53.960 --> 09:55.960
It's gotta be Fowler, dickhead.

09:55.960 --> 09:59.000
He was nicer looking.
Yeah, he's nicer looking.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.960
GROANING

10:23.160 --> 10:24.960
Good luck.

10:24.960 --> 10:28.320
Looks like you've got a bowl
of Koka noodles on your head, lad.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.960
I just look professional.
At least I make an effort.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.960
Order!

10:37.160 --> 10:38.960
Look at the state of him!

10:39.960 --> 10:42.800
What, then? What? What?

10:42.800 --> 10:43.960
Tell me!
Lewis.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.960
We go way back!

10:46.960 --> 10:47.960
She's the one that got me off

10:47.960 --> 10:49.960
when I was accused of smashing
a motorbike up.

10:49.960 --> 10:53.960
She is a superb barrister.
That's very kind, thank you.

10:53.960 --> 10:56.960
And I 100% did it as well,
so she's very good, like.

10:56.960 --> 11:00.320
OK, Christopher, are you ready
for your opening statement?

11:00.320 --> 11:02.960
Members of the jury,
this case is simple.

11:02.960 --> 11:04.960
It is about an angry man
who sought revenge.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.000
And when he remembered
his ex-girlfriend

11:07.000 --> 11:09.960
doesn't use two-step authentication
on her TikTok account,

11:09.960 --> 11:13.960
he saw his chance to strike!
GASPS

11:13.960 --> 11:16.960
Miss Aimee Morris is a kind,
passionate,

11:16.960 --> 11:18.640
driven young woman,

11:18.640 --> 11:22.160
and hacking into her account
and posting a defamatory video

11:22.160 --> 11:24.960
was a deliberate attempt
to sabotage that reputation

11:24.960 --> 11:26.960
and paint her as a villain.

11:26.960 --> 11:28.960
But you will hear evidence
during this case

11:28.960 --> 11:31.960
that proves the only villain here...

11:31.960 --> 11:33.960
is Mr Lewis Connolly.
Nah.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.960
JEERING
I'm no villain, me.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.000
If any of youse reckon I'm guilty,
yeah,

11:38.000 --> 11:41.480
I'll bring your mas here
to the court and shag them.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.960
And even if you say, "Objection,"
I'll keep shagging them.

11:43.960 --> 11:45.960
JEERING

11:45.960 --> 11:47.960
Order!

11:52.960 --> 11:55.960
Reece, do you actually have
an opening statement?

11:55.960 --> 11:58.160
Yes. Yes, I do.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.960
Members of the jury,
would you please?

12:03.960 --> 12:07.960
Reece! Reece! Reece!
Reece! Reece! Reece!

12:07.960 --> 12:09.960
Lads, you need to take this
seriously!

12:09.960 --> 12:11.960
Reece! Reece! Reece! Reece!

12:11.960 --> 12:13.960
Order! Order!

12:13.960 --> 12:17.960
Would you say Lewis was bitter
about you breaking up with him?

12:17.960 --> 12:20.800
So bitter that he sought revenge?

12:20.800 --> 12:23.960
Defo. He used to write me
these weird love poems.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.960
For the purpose of the court,
Mr Connolly,

12:25.960 --> 12:28.960
can you please read out
the evidence as presented?

12:31.960 --> 12:33.960
A...

12:33.960 --> 12:34.960
is for "amazing tits".

12:34.960 --> 12:35.960
Vile.

12:35.960 --> 12:37.960
I...

12:37.960 --> 12:39.960
is for "interesting arse".

12:39.960 --> 12:41.960
And he wonders why I left him.
M...

12:42.960 --> 12:44.480
...is for "marvellous fanny".

12:44.480 --> 12:46.960
Ugh!
E...

12:47.960 --> 12:50.960
...is for "excited to eat you out".

12:50.960 --> 12:52.000
Knocks me sick.
E...

12:53.320 --> 12:54.960
...is for "eating you out".

12:54.960 --> 12:55.960
Ugh!
Hang on!

12:55.960 --> 12:57.640
He stole that
from a John Keates poem!

12:57.640 --> 12:58.960
Who?

13:00.480 --> 13:03.960
Miss Morris,
could you please look at this?

13:05.000 --> 13:06.960
Let's all do the beach, man!

13:06.960 --> 13:08.960
Let's all do the beach, man!

13:08.960 --> 13:12.000
Nah, nah, nah, nah!
Order in the court!

13:12.000 --> 13:13.960
Members of the jury,

13:13.960 --> 13:16.960
I hired an online sleuth
to obtain the IP address

13:16.960 --> 13:19.160
of where the TikTok post originated.

13:19.160 --> 13:20.960
What the fuck's a sleuth?

13:20.960 --> 13:22.960
And this is the e-mail I received
which states

13:22.960 --> 13:27.320
that the IP address matches
a computer in the school library.

13:27.320 --> 13:28.960
So?
Who cares?

13:28.960 --> 13:30.960
OK, well, wait for this.

13:30.960 --> 13:33.960
We have an eyewitness statement
that says they saw Mr Connolly

13:33.960 --> 13:38.960
using that same computer
on Friday at 12:29.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.320
What is he on about?
Who cares?

13:40.320 --> 13:43.960
The TikTok post was made at 12:31!

13:43.960 --> 13:45.960
GASPS

13:45.960 --> 13:48.960
CLAMOUR

13:49.960 --> 13:50.960
You're finished.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.960
Lad, I need your help.
I didn't do it.

14:04.960 --> 14:07.960
Behave, lad.
Look, like, that poem, yeah?

14:07.960 --> 14:09.960
I just wanted her to know
I was hurting because...

14:10.960 --> 14:12.960
...it kills me that I love her

14:12.960 --> 14:14.000
and she doesn't feel the same
about me.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.960
Please?

14:15.960 --> 14:16.960
If you get me off,
no more dad jokes.

14:16.960 --> 14:20.480
OK, OK, maybe down to, like,
one a month.

14:20.480 --> 14:23.960
I'll make a conscious shift
from quantity to quality.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.320
Swear down.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.960
Can someone get back to me
and tell me why it's been moved?

14:35.960 --> 14:37.960
He's not going through
another two weeks of hell.

14:42.960 --> 14:45.960
WAILING

14:45.960 --> 14:47.960
Give me the drugs!

14:47.960 --> 14:49.960
Cor, this dickhead and his torches.

14:49.960 --> 14:52.960
Don't make me shoot my own brother!

14:52.960 --> 14:54.960
WHIMPERS

14:55.960 --> 14:58.000
APPLAUSE

14:58.000 --> 15:02.960
And that was completely improvised
because in acting,

15:02.960 --> 15:04.960
sometimes you have to think
on your feet.

15:04.960 --> 15:07.960
Do you know, it actually felt
really real, Sir.

15:07.960 --> 15:10.960
Like, me dad killed his brother
just last week for drugs.

15:10.960 --> 15:14.960
And the street name for all drugs
these days is just "drugs".

15:14.960 --> 15:16.800
Saves all the confusion.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.800
Thank you.

15:18.800 --> 15:21.960
And I'm sorry for your loss.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.960
Let's do some improv situations.

15:23.960 --> 15:24.960
I'll set you in pairs,

15:24.960 --> 15:27.960
and you can use this torch
as a creative prop

15:27.960 --> 15:29.960
to help inspire the scene.

15:29.960 --> 15:34.960
Welcome to
the Socially "In just this" podcast.

15:34.960 --> 15:37.960
This week,
we're discussing white privilege.

15:37.960 --> 15:39.960
My guest today is Mia-Louise.

15:39.960 --> 15:40.960
Good afternoon.
Er...

15:40.960 --> 15:43.960
you're white privilege, girl,
for saying "good afternoon"

15:43.960 --> 15:45.960
just cos white people
have generally had good afternoons.

15:45.960 --> 15:47.960
What about Black people and slavery?

15:47.960 --> 15:50.000
They weren't good afternoons,
were they?

15:50.000 --> 15:53.960
So, according to our records,
you've been unemployed

15:53.960 --> 15:55.960
and on Universal Credit
for two years since leaving school.

15:55.960 --> 15:57.960
How's that job search going?

15:57.960 --> 15:59.960
I'm sure there's something
out there for me. Hmm.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.160
Hm.

16:01.160 --> 16:04.960
What is white privilege?

16:04.960 --> 16:05.960
How do we define it?

16:05.960 --> 16:08.960
Er, is it a young white girl
who thinks she's interesting enough

16:08.960 --> 16:12.960
to have her own podcast and then
constantly emails everyone about it?

16:12.960 --> 16:14.960
I've found a cleaning job
here at Asda.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.960
Would you be interested?

16:16.960 --> 16:18.960
Nothing against cleaning,
but I'd like to do something

16:18.960 --> 16:21.480
in the entertainment industry.

16:21.480 --> 16:25.960
Oh, my God, the host of the podcast
has just been arrested live on air.

16:25.960 --> 16:28.800
For a violent racial hate crime.
On a woman.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.640
Who was also a refugee!

16:30.640 --> 16:34.960
Then she's burnt the Pride flag,
and she's even chopped down a tree!

16:34.960 --> 16:37.160
But sometimes you have to be
a bit more realistic

16:37.160 --> 16:38.960
with our careers.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.160
You know, we can't waste our lives
chasing an unrealistic dream

16:41.160 --> 16:43.000
with nothing to fall back on.
PHONE BUZZING

16:43.000 --> 16:46.960
For example, you try to make it
as a singer, fail

16:46.960 --> 16:49.960
and end up becoming
a bad Elvis impersonator

16:49.960 --> 16:51.320
who can't support his family.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.960
Shut up, you stupid, pouty bitch!

16:53.960 --> 16:55.960
GASPS

16:55.960 --> 16:58.960
Exceptional, Grace.

16:58.960 --> 17:02.000
The conflict really helped
imbue the scene with emotion.

17:02.000 --> 17:07.800
I'll see you guys tomorrow,
at 1pm sharp, for the auditions.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.960
Thanks for calling me back.
'How's tomorrow?'

17:09.960 --> 17:12.640
Tomorrow is great. What time?
'1pm?

17:13.960 --> 17:15.960
'Love?'
Yeah.

17:15.960 --> 17:18.480
Yeah, that's OK.

17:18.480 --> 17:20.960
Calling a hit on Grace?

17:20.960 --> 17:23.960
My first was tough too,
but sometimes it has to be done.

17:25.960 --> 17:26.960
Don't worry.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.960
You're gonna do great
in the audition.

17:28.960 --> 17:32.000
And tomorrow this whole school's
going to know what Lewis did to you.

17:35.480 --> 17:39.000
Hello there.
I'm so sorry, can I cancel that hit?

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
Yeah, this posh divvy's
making me feel a lot better.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.960
OK, thank you. Take care, bye-bye!

17:47.160 --> 17:49.960
CHATTER

17:55.800 --> 17:56.960
Order!

17:56.960 --> 17:58.960
In the absence
of the defending barrister,

17:58.960 --> 18:00.160
and on the charge of Lewis Connolly

18:00.160 --> 18:03.800
hacking me mate's TikTok
and generally being a bad ming,

18:03.800 --> 18:05.960
how do we find him?

18:05.960 --> 18:06.960
Stop!
GASPS

18:06.960 --> 18:10.640
The defence has some new evidence it
would like to share with the jury.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.960
My "Leonard" friend said

18:12.960 --> 18:17.960
that Mr Connolly was last seen
on said computer at 12:29.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.960
And he's right, he was.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.320
What are you playing at, lad?

18:22.640 --> 18:24.960
But he wasn't on Aimee's TikTok.

18:24.960 --> 18:27.960
He was printing materials off
for his big lunchtime wank,

18:27.960 --> 18:30.000
cos everybody knows
he's not a good mind wanker.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.960
MURMURS OF AGREEMENT
Lewis then took these materials

18:32.960 --> 18:35.960
and enjoyed his lunchtime wank
in the bog.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.960
Now, ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

18:37.960 --> 18:39.960
can you help me with a question?

18:39.960 --> 18:44.960
What time did my "Leonard" friend

18:44.960 --> 18:46.800
say the TikTok post was made?

18:46.800 --> 18:48.000
12:31.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.960
Thank you for your assistance.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.960
Now, as we all know,

18:51.960 --> 18:53.960
Meachy likes to keep
a close eye on us.

18:53.960 --> 18:57.160
So, here we have
Friday's CCTV footage

18:57.160 --> 18:58.640
of the south corridor,

18:58.640 --> 18:59.960
where you will now see Mr Connolly

18:59.960 --> 19:03.960
leaving the bogs
in post-nut clarity bliss.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.000
Dirty bastard.
Vile.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.960
Now, I know what youse are thinking,
ladies and gentlemen.

19:08.960 --> 19:10.960
Lewis was on the computer at 12:29.

19:10.960 --> 19:14.960
He printed his materials,
posted the TikTok at 12:31,

19:14.960 --> 19:15.960
then went for his elite
lunchtime wank.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.160
Except he didn't.

19:18.160 --> 19:20.960
Because the time here is 12:32!

19:20.960 --> 19:22.960
GASPS
I didn't post it!

19:22.960 --> 19:23.960
I therefore put to you

19:23.960 --> 19:26.960
that Mr Connolly
was actually wankin'

19:26.960 --> 19:27.960
at the time in question.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.960
GASPS
Oh, and also,

19:29.960 --> 19:32.960
he's a rapid wanker too.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.960
Get in!

19:36.960 --> 19:38.960
Thank you so much.
I didn't post it.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.960
Y-You do believe me, don't you?

19:40.960 --> 19:43.480
I know we've never been
the best of mates, but...

19:43.480 --> 19:45.480
Oh, my God, you don't.

19:46.960 --> 19:48.960
Oh, my God. She did it.

19:49.960 --> 19:51.160
Thank you, son.
It's OK.

19:51.160 --> 19:52.640
Reece.

19:52.640 --> 19:54.960
Could you come by our chambers
after school

19:54.960 --> 19:57.960
to sort out the paperwork,
meet your fellow cohorts?

20:00.960 --> 20:02.960
Reece! Reece! Reece!

20:02.960 --> 20:04.960
Reece! Reece! Reece!

20:04.960 --> 20:06.960
Reece! Reece! Reece! Reece!
Reece! Reece!

20:06.960 --> 20:09.000
Reece! Reece! Reece! Reece!
CHEERING

20:10.160 --> 20:11.960
Aims? Where you going?

20:13.480 --> 20:15.960
Wahey-hey! Come on!

20:15.960 --> 20:17.960
THEY CHEER
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:17.960 --> 20:21.960
And when CCTV caught me putting
six school laptops in me car,

20:21.960 --> 20:23.480
Meachy deepfaked it, lad.

20:23.480 --> 20:26.960
I'm innocent! Come on!
CHEERING

20:26.960 --> 20:27.960
Come on!

we've analysed the MRI scan results.

21:11.960 --> 21:15.960
Unfortunately, it has confirmed
areas of lesions in the brain.

21:16.960 --> 21:17.960
I'll be OK.

21:17.960 --> 21:19.960
The cost-of-living crises

21:19.960 --> 21:21.960
has brought you
to the bones of your arse,

21:21.960 --> 21:24.960
and now you've just been fired.

21:24.960 --> 21:25.960
You can't do that!

21:25.960 --> 21:27.960
It's humiliating as it is,

21:27.960 --> 21:32.960
having to rely on charities
for toothpaste and bog roll.

21:32.960 --> 21:36.960
I have a kid,
and her da does nothing.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.960

monologue that fits the character.

22:05.960 --> 22:08.960
Aimee, you're too late.
I have to get my train.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.960
What do you do when
you feel like you're drowning?

22:12.960 --> 22:16.960
When you go from being a kid

22:16.960 --> 22:20.960
to suddenly having to deal with
heartbreak,

22:20.960 --> 22:24.000
misery, anger?

22:24.000 --> 22:26.320
They don't teach you that in school,
do they?

22:27.960 --> 22:30.960
They act like...

22:30.960 --> 22:33.960
as long as you study hard,
you'll be happy.

22:33.960 --> 22:36.960
What they don't say is, one day...

22:38.320 --> 22:41.000
...you might get bad news...

22:41.000 --> 22:43.960
that makes you feel like
you've been thrown

22:43.960 --> 22:48.640
into a deep hole of despair.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.960
When you're a kid,

22:50.960 --> 22:54.960
there is no problem
that your parents can't solve.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.960
They're indestructible.

23:01.960 --> 23:03.960
And then you get older...

23:05.960 --> 23:08.960
...and it's devastating
to realise that they aren't.

23:08.960 --> 23:13.960
Maybe that's why no-one prepares you
for being an adult.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.960
Because they're still not prepared.

23:19.960 --> 23:21.960
Maybe nothing can prepare you.

23:25.960 --> 23:28.800
That was good, Aimee. Very good.

23:29.960 --> 23:32.960
But you know what?
I just can't rely on you.

23:32.960 --> 23:34.960
You're late, you're irritable,

23:34.960 --> 23:36.960
and quite frankly, you're trouble,

23:36.960 --> 23:38.320
and people don't like working
with trouble.

23:39.800 --> 23:42.960
Grace... I'll see you in London.

23:42.960 --> 23:44.960
'Ey, Jenson!

23:44.960 --> 23:47.160
I looked you up on LinkedIn. Yeah.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.960
You from around here, are you?
You're a fraud.

23:49.960 --> 23:53.480
You're a joke, mate.
This whole school's a joke!

23:53.480 --> 23:55.960
It's full of bad gimps!
GASPS, JEERS

23:55.960 --> 23:57.960
You can all fuck off, mate!

23:57.960 --> 23:59.960
Aims, what's goin' on?

24:02.960 --> 24:05.160
All right, soft lad?

24:07.320 --> 24:09.640
Where've you been?

24:09.640 --> 24:11.480
The fella from your law placement
called me.

24:11.480 --> 24:12.960
He said you did a runner.

24:12.960 --> 24:14.960
I told him you better had the shits
or I'll kill you.

24:14.960 --> 24:17.320
I've put it on Instagram, Reece!

24:17.320 --> 24:21.160
"Hashtag so proud.
Hashtag lawyer in the family.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.800
"Hashtag not the accused this time."

24:23.800 --> 24:25.960
I know, Mum. I saw the 50 hashtags.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.960
Then what the fuck happened?

24:29.960 --> 24:31.960
There was this lad there
called Remington.

24:31.960 --> 24:34.960
Some girl called Persephone.
She was quite fit.

24:34.960 --> 24:39.000
But they were speaking about
Villa versus someone in 2018.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.960
I thought they were speaking
about an FA Cup game,

24:41.960 --> 24:44.960
but it turns out they were
speaking about some legal case,

24:44.960 --> 24:46.960
a guy called Villa.

24:48.480 --> 24:50.960
I felt like a tit, Mum.

24:50.960 --> 24:52.960
So I just left.

24:54.960 --> 24:56.960
Can't say I blame you.

24:57.960 --> 25:02.160
Look, I'm not gonna force you
to go back if you don't want to, OK?

25:02.160 --> 25:05.960
But I can't let you swerve it cos
you don't think you're good enough.

25:05.960 --> 25:07.800
Fuck Persephone!

25:09.960 --> 25:13.960
You've got just as much right to be
there as any of them have, son.

25:13.960 --> 25:15.960
You've just gotta start
believing it, OK?

25:16.960 --> 25:18.960
OK.

25:18.960 --> 25:20.320
Your tea's inside.

25:20.320 --> 25:21.960
Persephone!

25:24.960 --> 25:26.960
"Hashtag so proud?"

25:28.960 --> 25:31.960
I got you a gift to say well done
for winning the case.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.960
For when you start
your joinery apprenticeship.

25:36.960 --> 25:39.320
You mean to say sorry cos you
thought you were gonna win easily?

25:39.320 --> 25:42.960
What? No. I gave you that impression
on purpose to help motivate you,

25:42.960 --> 25:43.960
and it worked.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.960
All right, lad.
I would never assume anything!

25:45.960 --> 25:47.160
I'm not that entitled.

25:47.160 --> 25:51.480
Eurgh, my shoes are so dirty.
Where is he?

25:51.480 --> 25:53.960

25:53.960 --> 25:55.000
No, no, no, no, no.
