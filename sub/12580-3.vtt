WEBVTT

00:33.283 --> 00:34.325
<i>Finito.</i>

00:34.409 --> 00:35.785
<i>Pasame sus testes.</i>

00:36.161 --> 00:39.247
Oh, and do not forget
tonight's extra credit assignment.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.207
You're just a sub.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.460
You can't give extra credit.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.795
Well, no. Not towards your grade.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.756
But you will get credit with me,

00:47.839 --> 00:49.924
and those Peggy points add up.

00:51.092 --> 00:53.178
Well, <i>hola, Señor</i> Chairman Geiger.

00:53.261 --> 00:56.681
Peggy, I just got off the phone
with Jeanine Truesdale.

00:56.765 --> 00:59.059
She's taking another personal day.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.685
So I'll need you again tomorrow,

01:00.769 --> 01:02.520
and you'll have to cover the Spanish Club.

01:02.604 --> 01:03.772
Tomorrow?

01:03.855 --> 01:06.775
Tomorrow is the Spanish Club
field trip to <i>Mexico?</i>

01:06.858 --> 01:07.901


01:07.984 --> 01:12.363
I didn't make it to department head
supervising three people

01:12.447 --> 01:15.617
by letting a sub take students
to a foreign land.

01:17.327 --> 01:20.371
And I didn't make it
to Substitute Teacher of the Year

01:20.455 --> 01:21.915
by taking no for an answer.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.501
Except on tests with yes or no questions

01:24.584 --> 01:26.294
where "no" was the correct answer.

01:26.961 --> 01:27.921
You can come, too.

01:28.713 --> 01:31.716
Well, the bus is nonrefundable.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.928
And my throat could use a break
from speaking German.

01:35.011 --> 01:36.846
I will not let you down.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.890
This is the rare instance where the sub

01:38.973 --> 01:41.768
is actually more dependable
than the regular teacher,

01:41.851 --> 01:44.938
who I suspect is, in fact, a drunk.

01:46.439 --> 01:47.857
Hey, I got an idea.

01:47.941 --> 01:51.569
Instead of going to Mexico,
why don't you borrow my sombrero,

01:51.653 --> 01:54.197
stay in Arlen and teach the kids to count.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.533
You know, <i>uno, dos, tres,</i> like that.

01:56.616 --> 01:59.494
Hank, why don't you want me
to go to <i>Mexico</i>?

01:59.994 --> 02:01.538
Is it the exchange rate?

02:01.621 --> 02:03.081
No, uh...

02:03.748 --> 02:07.627
It's just that
the Spanish they speak there is, uh,

02:07.710 --> 02:09.337
you know, fluent.

02:09.420 --> 02:11.089
And I am not fluent?

02:12.340 --> 02:15.844
In fact, I am so fluent
that I may tutor a few <i>Mexican</i> kids

02:15.927 --> 02:16.761
while I'm down there.

02:16.845 --> 02:17.679
How about that?

02:22.183 --> 02:23.226
Bobby.

02:25.895 --> 02:28.231
It is crucial that
I impress Chairman Geiger.

02:28.314 --> 02:31.151
Although I'm sure all the kids
will love this trip,

02:31.234 --> 02:33.486
I need one unified voice

02:33.570 --> 02:35.405
to vocalize what everyone is thinking.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.074
Here are your lines.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.621
-What is that?
-A Spanish dictionary.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.081
Dad made me take it.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.458
Your mother is a Spanish dictionary.

02:49.335 --> 02:52.964
Oh, Bobby, if you ever marry
a Spanish teacher,

02:53.047 --> 02:54.382
and you probably will,

02:54.465 --> 02:56.926
never doubt her enormous gifts.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.597
Peggy, this is the itinerary

03:00.680 --> 03:02.432
Miss Truesdale planned for the trip.

03:02.515 --> 03:04.809
Mm. What's on there, a tequila factory?

03:06.269 --> 03:08.479
Shame about the drinking. Oh, well.

03:11.774 --> 03:13.359
<i>She's going to turn over.</i>

03:13.443 --> 03:15.695
<i>Gosh, I wish Peggy were here to see this.</i>

03:24.787 --> 03:26.372
Oh, dang.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.416
Oh, dang!

03:37.133 --> 03:39.052
License and registration, please.

03:39.636 --> 03:40.970
Oh, uh, for the record,

03:41.054 --> 03:43.681
the man on the license weighs 190,

03:43.765 --> 03:46.643
and I'm up to about 197 now.

03:46.726 --> 03:47.977
I would have had it changed,

03:48.061 --> 03:50.313
but I was hoping to get back
to my playing weight.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.982
Let me guess. Football?

03:53.066 --> 03:55.610
Yep. Played a little halfback
at Arlen High.

03:55.693 --> 03:57.528
I think I saw you on the field

03:57.612 --> 03:59.656
when I was a cheerleader alternate
at Rumpert.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.824
Oh, you're too young to have seen me play.

04:01.908 --> 04:02.867
Am I?

04:02.951 --> 04:04.494
Ready? Okay.

04:04.577 --> 04:06.287
Let's make a rumpus Rumpert.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.581
Go, Rumpert!

04:10.416 --> 04:11.417
I'd do the split,

04:11.501 --> 04:14.337
but I've got a backup pistol
strapped to my ankle,

04:14.420 --> 04:17.006
and I'm not as flexible as I used to be.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.342
Oh, I'm sure you're still plenty flexible.

04:26.015 --> 04:28.351
I'm going to let you off
with just a warning,

04:28.434 --> 04:30.353
if you promise to drive safely.

04:30.436 --> 04:31.771
Oh, I promise.

04:31.854 --> 04:34.315
And not just because safe driving is cool,

04:34.399 --> 04:36.734
but because it's the right thing to do.

04:47.161 --> 04:49.539
On behalf of the Spanish Club,

04:49.622 --> 04:52.041
let me just say that we are honored

04:52.125 --> 04:58.089
to be guided by the first sub ever
to lead a field trip on foreign soil.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.382
Who's with me?

05:04.304 --> 05:06.723
Well, <i>gracias,</i> Roberto.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.141
But from now on,

05:08.224 --> 05:10.977
we will only speak
the language of the natives.

05:11.060 --> 05:14.772
Yeah, um, I'm going
to need those directions.

05:14.856 --> 05:15.940
Uh-uh-uh.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.608
<i>En espanol, por favor.</i>

05:17.692 --> 05:19.694
I don't speak no languages.

05:21.779 --> 05:23.364
Then I will teach you.

05:23.448 --> 05:26.159
"<i>Izquierda</i>" means "left"

05:26.242 --> 05:29.203
and "<i>derecha</i>" means "right."

05:29.287 --> 05:31.873
So do I make <i>izkerda</i> or <i>espercha</i>?

05:34.334 --> 05:35.209
<i>Espercha.</i>

05:35.293 --> 05:36.878
Anyway, it turns out

05:36.961 --> 05:40.173
the police officer used to be
a cheerleader over at Rumpert.

05:40.256 --> 05:41.466
Cheerleader?

05:41.549 --> 05:43.259
I thought you said he was a cop.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.678
It was one of those
lady cops you hear about.

05:45.762 --> 05:48.014
Jeez, it must have been humiliating

05:48.097 --> 05:50.183
to get a beating from a lady cop.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.809
There was no beating.

05:51.893 --> 05:53.895
We talked football,
she ripped up the ticket.

05:53.978 --> 05:54.812
End of story.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.107
Love story.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.860
Yeah, man. You know, Hank,
they ain't ever gone flirtin' that way

06:00.943 --> 06:02.403
at little ol' ticket like that, man.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.738
Didn't think you had it in you, man.

06:03.821 --> 06:05.907
I was not flirting!

06:05.990 --> 06:08.493
I didn't even mention
that I worked in propane.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.745
Did you mention you have a wife?

06:11.329 --> 06:12.163
Didn't come up.

06:12.246 --> 06:14.582
Oh, Hank, you're terrible.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.295
Where are we?

06:19.379 --> 06:20.713
Where's the museum?

06:20.797 --> 06:22.632
Oh, will you forget the museum?

06:22.715 --> 06:26.344
The <i>Mexico</i> I want my students to see
is not on any map.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.305
Well, it's certainly not on this map.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.015
Please stop the bus.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.308
I need to get my bearings.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.238
Oh, <i>perfecto.</i>

06:45.822 --> 06:47.323
We are going to follow him

06:47.407 --> 06:49.367
and show the kids a day in the life

06:49.450 --> 06:51.077
of a real <i>Mexicano,</i> huh?

06:51.744 --> 06:53.246
<i>Señor, donde va?</i>

06:53.329 --> 06:54.247
<i>Que?</i>

06:56.124 --> 06:57.166
Oh, excellent.

06:57.250 --> 07:01.003
He is going to work
at a <i>carneceria</i> or a carnival.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.632
Oh. Oh, my!

07:09.303 --> 07:10.263
<i>Pare.</i>

07:12.974 --> 07:14.434
<i>Oh! Bueno. Andale.</i>

07:15.143 --> 07:16.352
All right!

07:16.436 --> 07:18.396
Walk in <i>uno</i> file, <i>por favor.</i>

07:26.571 --> 07:29.282
What the hell kind of carnival is this?

07:29.365 --> 07:30.783
Well, it's a poor village.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.118
They can't afford the rides.

07:32.201 --> 07:34.662
But they do have a petting zoo.

07:35.371 --> 07:37.915
All right. <i>Pollo por u.</i>

07:37.999 --> 07:39.083
<i>Pollo por u.</i>

07:41.502 --> 07:43.880
Oh, Herman, everything is under control.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.631
Relax. Have a chicken.

07:45.715 --> 07:46.799
I don't know.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.301
Maybe I could hold just the one...

07:48.384 --> 07:50.428
<i>Mis pollos. Mis pollos. Denme los pollos!</i>

07:50.511 --> 07:51.554
Okay.

07:51.637 --> 07:52.805
He would like his chickens.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.348
And judging from his costume,

07:54.432 --> 07:56.726
I think he's getting ready for a show.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.443
My chicken is the star of the show.

08:07.570 --> 08:09.614
Oh, sweet mother-of-pearl.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.616
Everything's fine.

08:11.699 --> 08:13.826
Um, you have just watched

08:13.910 --> 08:16.579
one of my favorite <i>Mexican</i> magic tricks.

08:16.662 --> 08:19.707
And now, as his volunteer assistant,

08:19.790 --> 08:22.668
I will complete the illusion.

08:25.588 --> 08:26.464
Ole!

08:42.188 --> 08:44.607
Returning to the scene of the crime, huh?

08:44.690 --> 08:45.691
I don't feel right

08:45.775 --> 08:48.027
about you letting me off
the hook this morning.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.655
I think I need more
than a slap on the wrist.

08:50.738 --> 08:51.822
Really?

08:51.906 --> 08:54.116
Yeah. I'd like that ticket.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.953
<i>We got a possible 53...</i>

08:57.036 --> 09:00.540
God, I am not in the mood
for a possible arson right now.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.418
Here. I think this is what you came for.

09:04.502 --> 09:07.463
Oh, I thank you
for your professionalism, ma'am.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.593
Oh.

09:13.719 --> 09:17.306
The concept of students smiling
is foreign to me.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.141
I think your son put it best

09:19.225 --> 09:23.062
when he said the Spanish Department
would be lucky to have Peggy Hill

09:23.145 --> 09:25.022
as its newest permanent member.

09:25.106 --> 09:28.067
Oh, Bobby said that?

09:29.235 --> 09:30.903
I drank the water.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.155
Uh-uh. <i>En espanol.</i>

09:35.074 --> 09:36.450
Oh, <i>muy bueno.</i>

09:37.118 --> 09:38.828
Okay, come on, everybody.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.330
<i>El autobus, andale, andale.</i>

09:43.249 --> 09:44.875
Oh, thank you.

09:44.959 --> 09:45.918
I feel pretty.

09:46.002 --> 09:48.087
Now, everyone on the bus now, please.

09:53.676 --> 09:57.179
Yeah, we all love <i>Mexico,</i>
but it's time to go home.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.402
Oh, for heaven's sake.

10:11.485 --> 10:12.862
First she wouldn't get on the bus,

10:12.945 --> 10:14.280
now she won't go home.

10:14.363 --> 10:15.489
Where are your parents?

10:17.366 --> 10:19.869
Okay, we're back in America.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.621
You can speak English now.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.164
Now, honey, where are your parents?

10:24.999 --> 10:27.293
Yes, "Long live <i>Mexico</i>."

10:27.376 --> 10:28.836
Now where are your parents?

10:35.968 --> 10:37.511
Oh, my God!

10:39.972 --> 10:41.349
Oh, no.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.310
Thanks to Citizen Gorgeous,

10:44.393 --> 10:46.228
we have a police state in the alley.

10:46.979 --> 10:47.980
You three better leave

10:48.064 --> 10:50.191
before I write you tickets
for public drunkenness.

10:50.274 --> 10:52.193
But we're not drunk just yet.

10:52.276 --> 10:54.236
You want to spend
a day in court fighting it?

10:54.320 --> 10:56.072
Huh? Huh?

10:56.155 --> 10:58.115
Come on, big boy, huh?

10:58.199 --> 11:00.451
Uh, look, there's something
you should know.

11:00.534 --> 11:02.953
My wife is going to be home any minute.

11:03.037 --> 11:06.123
Do you know which route she's taking?
'Cause I could easily set up a roadblock.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.376
Uh, okay, then.

11:09.377 --> 11:10.670
Whee, doggie.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.714
I'll take me a burger
with that shake.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.300
Bye, fancy pants.

11:23.265 --> 11:24.975
Oh, we should have her call her parents

11:25.059 --> 11:26.352
in case they're worried.

11:26.435 --> 11:29.021
<i>Llame su familia, Lupe.</i>

11:31.399 --> 11:33.442
Oh, she refuses to call home

11:33.526 --> 11:35.194
because her family hates her.

11:35.277 --> 11:36.404
What's to hate?

11:37.029 --> 11:39.407
<i>Yo soy un madre, y yo soy certaino</i>

11:39.490 --> 11:41.784
<i>e su madre amore u mucho mucho.</i>

11:48.916 --> 11:50.167
I was afraid of this.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.086
Now she wishes that I was her mother.

11:52.169 --> 11:55.715
If your father or Herr Geiger
find out about this, it's over.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.299
We will hide her until morning,

11:57.383 --> 11:58.801
and when your father goes to work,

11:58.884 --> 12:01.178
I will smuggle her back into Mexico.

12:01.929 --> 12:03.180
Now give her some space.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.348
She does not like you.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.144
Take this to Lupe.

12:08.894 --> 12:11.397
Oh, my God, Bobby, did you rat me out?

12:11.480 --> 12:13.482
Did you? How much did they give you?

12:19.905 --> 12:21.198
What are you doing, girl?

12:21.282 --> 12:22.533
You leave a bone in there?

12:22.616 --> 12:23.534
A ball?

12:25.870 --> 12:27.121
Ah, a bone.

12:31.542 --> 12:34.086
Uh, Peggy, there's a little Mexican girl

12:34.170 --> 12:35.463
in the utility closet.

12:35.546 --> 12:36.714
Must be a friend of Bobby's.

12:36.797 --> 12:37.673
Bobby?

12:38.382 --> 12:39.300
Bobby!

12:40.801 --> 12:44.513
Okay, I accidentally brought her
back from Mexico.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.892
You brought an extra kid back
and didn't notice it?

12:49.310 --> 12:51.896
Well, we better call the authorities.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.898
What could the authorities do
that I can't,

12:53.981 --> 12:55.691
except ruin my teaching career?

12:55.775 --> 12:58.235
I am taking her back
first thing in the morning.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.696
Peggy, maybe you're in
a little over your head.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.991
I smuggled that girl into this country
without even knowing it.

13:04.074 --> 13:07.119
Don't you think I can smuggle her back
if I put my mind to it?

13:13.083 --> 13:15.085
Vaya con Dios.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.754
Is this show pretty accurate?

13:16.837 --> 13:18.172
Hank, close the blinds

13:18.255 --> 13:19.715
or put the wig back on Lupe.

13:20.841 --> 13:23.177
Oh, my Lord,
that policewoman is here again.

13:23.260 --> 13:24.637
What?

13:24.720 --> 13:26.514
We need a distraction.

13:26.597 --> 13:27.973
Ram her car with your truck,

13:28.057 --> 13:30.726
then get into one of those
high-speed chases.

13:31.435 --> 13:34.313
Boy, that's a handsome squad car.

13:34.396 --> 13:36.106
What is that, a Caprice?

13:36.190 --> 13:37.691
A Crown Victoria?

13:38.150 --> 13:39.693
It's a Crown Victoria.

13:39.777 --> 13:40.653
Uh-huh.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.655
How's the siren work?

13:42.738 --> 13:46.116
Has it got a button
or some kind of a toggle switch?

13:46.826 --> 13:48.410
-A toggle.
-Huh.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.746
Did you know in Greek mythology

13:50.830 --> 13:54.583
a siren was a beautiful woman
who sang so sweetly

13:54.667 --> 13:57.419
that she could make sailors
crash into the rocks?

13:57.503 --> 13:59.380
It's kind of romantic, isn't it?

13:59.463 --> 14:01.507
Actually, pretty irresponsible.

14:10.224 --> 14:11.684
Oh, great. Good job, Hank.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.936
Pull over, Mrs. Hill.

14:15.437 --> 14:20.985
Lupe, follow... my... lead.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.320
Step out of the car, please.

14:26.156 --> 14:27.575
Turn around. Spread 'em.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.619
Not bad.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.247
But take a look at this.

14:33.330 --> 14:35.082
Huh? Huh?

14:36.667 --> 14:37.960
Now get out of here!

14:39.879 --> 14:42.590
Peggy Hill, you are one cool customer.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.803
Well, honey, you're home.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.430
I don't want to make this goodbye

14:49.513 --> 14:50.973
-any harder than I...
-<i>¡Estoy aquí!</i>

14:51.056 --> 14:52.057
<i>¡Lupe!</i>

14:52.141 --> 14:53.475
<i>Lupe!</i>

14:58.898 --> 15:01.108
<i>Bendito sea Dios.</i>

15:01.191 --> 15:02.610
Do not worship me.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.445
Worship my actions.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.072
<i>¡Es ella!</i>

15:08.574 --> 15:10.868
Oh, please, you flatter me.

15:10.951 --> 15:13.871
<i>Por los niños. Por los niños.</i>

15:13.954 --> 15:15.915
I'm just here for the children.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.793
I'm getting a commendation?

15:19.877 --> 15:21.420
Wait till Geiger hears about this.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.380
I would have gotten here earlier,

15:23.464 --> 15:25.132
but some of your roads are very bad.

15:29.803 --> 15:31.931
<i>¡Justicia para Lupe!</i>

15:32.014 --> 15:33.641
<i>¡Justicia para Lupe!</i>

15:33.724 --> 15:35.726
<i>¡Justicia para Lupe!</i>

15:36.310 --> 15:37.394
<i>¿Comprende Español?</i>

15:38.187 --> 15:39.021
<i>Si, señor.</i>

15:45.694 --> 15:46.612
<i>Gracias.</i>

15:46.695 --> 15:49.573
<i>¿Un teléfono por llame
me esposo, por favor?</i>

15:55.329 --> 15:56.664
-Hello.
-Hank.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.707
I am in Nuevo Laredo,

15:58.791 --> 16:01.919
and I am a big freaking hero
for bringing Lupe home safely.

16:02.002 --> 16:04.088
Good job, Peggy.

16:04.171 --> 16:05.130
I'm proud of you.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.090
Thank you.

16:06.173 --> 16:08.008
Now, I need you to do me a solid.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.302
Get me the number for Herr Geiger.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.888
I want him on speakerphone
when I meet the Mayor.

16:12.972 --> 16:13.931
Okay.

16:14.014 --> 16:16.016
I think I saw your address book
on the nightstand.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.018
<i>Okay... Uh...</i>

16:18.102 --> 16:19.478
<i>Excuse me.</i>

16:19.561 --> 16:20.771
<i>What are you doing?</i>

16:20.854 --> 16:22.648
<i>You will give me back my shoelaces?</i>

16:22.731 --> 16:25.359
<i>I am a United States citizen!
These are chains!</i>

16:25.442 --> 16:27.027
<i>Ow! That is too tight!</i>

16:27.111 --> 16:30.280
<i>You are creating
an incident</i> internacionale.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.992
<i>Hank! Hank!</i>

16:33.075 --> 16:34.159
Patience, Peggy.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.787
Okay. "Herman Geiger..."

16:36.870 --> 16:38.664
<i>Hank, I have been arrested!</i>

16:38.747 --> 16:40.457
<i>Peggy, quit messing around.</i>

16:40.541 --> 16:42.334
<i>This is long distance.</i>

16:42.418 --> 16:44.712
Get down here, Hank! Help!

16:44.795 --> 16:46.422
Help!

16:46.505 --> 16:48.674
<i>Help! Hank!</i>

16:50.759 --> 16:52.511
Oh, I knew he'd come back.

16:52.594 --> 16:54.388
This time I'm going
to make that horse drink.

17:00.811 --> 17:01.812
Okay.

17:01.895 --> 17:03.105
Okay, I was speeding.

17:03.188 --> 17:04.606
You weren't speeding, Hank.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.649
Feel this.

17:07.317 --> 17:09.403
Look, this is not a good time.

17:09.486 --> 17:10.612
My wife is in trouble.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.114
You know, I don't get you.

17:12.197 --> 17:14.033
One minute,
you're trying to get under my hood,

17:14.116 --> 17:15.868
and the next minute,
you don't want to leave your wife.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.995
I never wanted to leave my wife.

17:18.078 --> 17:19.788
I'm sick of these mind games.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.248
Maybe I should just take you in.

17:21.331 --> 17:23.917
No, no. I've got to go.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.586
Halt or I'll shoot!

17:25.669 --> 17:29.048
How can I be sure
about those alleged seven extra pounds

17:29.131 --> 17:31.216
you say you're carrying, huh?

17:31.300 --> 17:34.011
That could be a gun or stolen art,
for all I know.

17:34.094 --> 17:35.095
I assure you

17:35.179 --> 17:38.348
it is simply a small
additional ridge of fat.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.517
If you want to go to your wife so bad,

17:40.601 --> 17:42.186
then I got to frisk you.

17:42.269 --> 17:45.731
Uh, I'm not really comfortable
being touched.

17:45.814 --> 17:47.399
Then I'll just have to take you in.

17:49.485 --> 17:50.819
Oh.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.654
All right.

17:56.575 --> 17:59.244
<i>♪ Oh, say, can you see ♪</i>

17:59.328 --> 18:02.164
<i>♪ By the dawn's early light ♪</i>

18:02.247 --> 18:03.957
<i>♪ What so proudly... ♪</i>

18:10.714 --> 18:11.882
You're clean.

18:19.306 --> 18:21.600
I feel dirty.

18:26.396 --> 18:28.107
Bye, Fancy Pants.

18:29.983 --> 18:32.236
This hearing will determine
if there is enough evidence

18:32.319 --> 18:33.278
to hold you for trial.

18:33.862 --> 18:35.197
If we do go to trial,

18:35.280 --> 18:38.700
you will be transferred to a facility
in Mexico City until your court date,

18:38.784 --> 18:40.994
which could be anywhere
from one-and-a-half to six years.

19:09.690 --> 19:10.607
Hank!

19:10.691 --> 19:11.733
Hank, over here!

19:12.693 --> 19:14.820
All right, Peggy, get your stuff.

19:14.903 --> 19:16.113
No, no, no, no, no.

19:16.196 --> 19:19.449
I'm afraid the charges
against your wife are quite serious,

19:19.533 --> 19:21.493
but I have a brilliant plan.

19:21.577 --> 19:24.538
I intend to show
that her Spanish is so poor,

19:24.621 --> 19:26.456
she could barely order a glass of water,

19:26.540 --> 19:28.917
much less order that child to do anything.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.128
That is completely untrue!

19:31.211 --> 19:33.505
And if that goes down
on the Mexican records,

19:33.589 --> 19:35.257
my teaching career is <i>tostada</i>.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.884
Uh-uh. I am very fluent.

19:36.967 --> 19:38.510
Listen to me roll my r's.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.306
I rest my case.

19:44.892 --> 19:45.976
Oh, did you hear that?

19:46.059 --> 19:47.394
Now we have to all sit here

19:47.477 --> 19:49.479
while this guy goes out and buys a hat.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.943
Mr. Ortiz, I hate to disagree with you,

19:55.027 --> 19:57.654
but my wife speaks perfect Spanish.

19:57.738 --> 20:00.449
You must put her on the stand.

20:00.532 --> 20:01.533
But that is crazy.

20:01.617 --> 20:06.580
So that she may tell her story
in her own words.

20:07.331 --> 20:08.540
In Spanish.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.043
Ah, of course.

20:22.679 --> 20:26.058
Uh, Peggy, I think
you should go up on the stand.

20:26.141 --> 20:27.059
You're right.

20:27.142 --> 20:29.895
That blowhard will go on forever
if I don't get up there.

20:32.147 --> 20:34.233
Mrs. Hill, in your own words,

20:34.316 --> 20:36.360
your own Spanish words,

20:36.443 --> 20:39.238
please tell the judge
what happened with little Lupe.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.060
<i>Señora</i> Hill...

21:24.241 --> 21:27.911
Oh, my God! I'm going to jail!

21:27.995 --> 21:29.621
He said you're not guilty.

21:29.705 --> 21:32.582
Oh. Oh, right. Good.

21:32.666 --> 21:33.667
Oh, thank you.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.253
<i>Gracias, por Jugo!</i>

21:36.336 --> 21:38.630
Congratulations, Peggy, you did it.

21:38.714 --> 21:41.800
See? And that is not Spanish for "yes."

21:41.883 --> 21:45.679
That is Peggy Hill
for "I told you so." See?

22:22.799 --> 22:25.385
Stuart: <i>My chicken is
the star of the show.</i>
