WEBVTT

00:03.610 --> 00:05.310
taste this.

00:05.320 --> 00:08.550
I don't need to taste it.
It's a chocolate laxative.

00:08.560 --> 00:10.950
I think it needs more caramel.

00:13.780 --> 00:19.250
I'm telling you, alan, one of these days that kid's
gonna fart and birds are gonna fall out of the sky.

00:20.110 --> 00:21.700
Funny. Uh, listen.

00:21.710 --> 00:24.610
- How much is a hooker?
- What?

00:24.620 --> 00:26.610
Alan, what are you
gonna do with a hooker?

00:26.620 --> 00:30.380
Well, I'd like to pay
her to have sex with me.

00:30.410 --> 00:32.850
Yeah. But... why?

00:32.860 --> 00:33.720
Well, I've been thinking...

00:33.730 --> 00:36.010
I don't have have a great
track record with relationships,

00:36.030 --> 00:41.270
but I still have desires, so I figure--
why not simplify, get back to basics.

00:41.300 --> 00:44.800
No relationship, no
disappointment, just sex.

00:45.140 --> 00:49.130
Well, sex with you, there's
bound to be some disappointment.

00:49.840 --> 00:53.600
I mean, even with a hooker, money
only buys you so much goodwill.

00:53.610 --> 00:55.350
But I don't have to care.

00:55.390 --> 01:00.180
Because it's a straight business transaction,
the only needs that are important are mine.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.970
Hey, you don't have to sell me on it.

01:02.980 --> 01:05.430
I just never pictured
you doing anything this.

01:05.470 --> 01:06.060
Me neither.

01:06.070 --> 01:07.000
But you know what's interesting?

01:07.020 --> 01:11.810
Once I decided to give up trying to
live a moral life, I felt somehow free.

01:11.820 --> 01:14.950
Again, you don't have to sell me on it.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.440
How ch you looking to spend?

01:16.470 --> 01:19.990
Uh, well, as you know, I am
a bit of a bargain hunter.

01:20.410 --> 01:24.920
Yeah, but, unfortunately, they don't
stock hookers at the 99-cent store.

01:24.930 --> 01:25.800
Give me a number.

01:25.820 --> 01:27.900
Okay, well, um...

01:27.920 --> 01:31.870
what could I get in the $200 range?

01:31.890 --> 01:33.860
Crabs.

01:34.600 --> 01:36.930
And get carjacked.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.840
All right, then... why
don't you give me a number.

01:41.640 --> 01:42.480
For one night?

01:42.490 --> 01:44.160
For one hour.

01:44.600 --> 01:45.730
One hour?

01:45.740 --> 01:48.810
I want sex, not surround sound.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.220
Trust me, it's worth it.

01:51.230 --> 01:53.750
For that kind of money, you
get the girlfriend experience.

01:53.770 --> 01:54.750
Haven't you been listening?

01:54.760 --> 01:56.850
I don't want the girlfriend experience.

01:56.880 --> 02:01.540
I want sex-- guiltless,
emotionless, selfish sex.

02:01.580 --> 02:02.400
I understand.

02:02.410 --> 02:04.530
At a reasonable price.

02:04.540 --> 02:06.880
Got it. I'm make a few
calls, see what I can do.

02:06.890 --> 02:08.350
That'd be good.

02:08.360 --> 02:11.880
- And try to get a nonsmoker.
- Sure.

02:11.890 --> 02:15.570
Who wants a girl who would put one
of those nasty things in her mouth?

02:16.010 --> 02:19.200
Charlie? Charlie harper?

02:19.930 --> 02:20.720
how are you?

02:20.730 --> 02:22.890
Wow, how long has it been?

02:22.900 --> 02:24.200
Too long.

02:24.210 --> 02:26.160
This is my brother alan.

02:26.170 --> 02:27.730
This is my daughter milly.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.120
- Hi, milly.
- Hello, milly.

02:29.130 --> 02:33.120
Boy, this is some
killer crumb cake. Hello.

02:34.980 --> 02:38.050
Milly, this is my son
jake; jake, this is milly.

02:38.060 --> 02:40.110
Want some cake?

02:40.120 --> 02:41.530
I dot n'eat sugar.

02:41.540 --> 02:45.170
Oh, yeah, me neither, unless it's
in like pies and cookies and stuff.

02:45.180 --> 02:47.840
- Whatever.
- Yeah, whatever.

02:49.280 --> 02:51.010
I play guitar; I'm in a band.

02:51.020 --> 02:54.610
They'rcalled the dudes of rockage--
heavy metal, classic rock kind of stuff.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.220
I'm into gwen stefani.

02:56.240 --> 02:58.300
Oh, yeah, they're great.

03:00.210 --> 03:02.110
You sure you don't want some cake?

03:02.120 --> 03:03.340
No, thanks.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.970
Oh, gee, we have to get going.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.900
Call me sometime, charlie, maybe we can
get together, have dinner and catch up.

03:08.920 --> 03:09.900
That would be great.

03:09.920 --> 03:10.970
Do you still have my number?

03:10.990 --> 03:15.810
I'm-I'm sure I do, but...
you know, just in case.

03:16.460 --> 03:18.080
Woman: Here you go.

03:18.090 --> 03:20.130
- Pleasure to meet you, alan.
- Same here.

03:22.840 --> 03:25.540
Shs emems ce. Who is she?

03:25.920 --> 03:28.210
I have no frickin' idea.

03:29.280 --> 03:30.940
I'll tell you who she is...

03:30.950 --> 03:33.510
the grandmother of my children.

03:42.560 --> 03:44.440
******

03:44.630 --> 03:45.690
what?

03:45.700 --> 03:49.030
Could you do me a favor and call milly's
mom and find out if milly likes me?

03:49.040 --> 03:52.310
But don't tell her I asked, 'cause
I don't want to appear needy.

03:52.840 --> 03:55.060
I'm on it.

04:01.290 --> 04:03.540
You're not gonna do it, are you?

04:03.550 --> 04:05.840
What was your first clue?

04:05.850 --> 04:07.740
Come on. Why not?

04:07.750 --> 04:09.140
Jake, buddy...

04:09.150 --> 04:11.980
I don't even remember
who milly's mom is.

04:11.990 --> 04:14.630
Calling her will put me
in a very awkward position.

04:14.650 --> 04:17.089
More awkward than the time I had
to pretend to be lost at the mall

04:17.100 --> 04:19.560
so you could meet the
cute security guard?

04:19.570 --> 04:21.310
Hey, we both benefited from that.

04:21.329 --> 04:22.640
How do you figure?

04:22.650 --> 04:25.320
I got a hot date and
you got a hot pretzel.

04:28.100 --> 04:31.060
It was an excellent pretzel.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.130
Did you make the call?

04:34.140 --> 04:35.120
Geez!

04:35.140 --> 04:37.780
Everybody wants me to pimp for them.

04:39.480 --> 04:43.930
I might as well get myself an orange hat,
platform shoes and a full-length fur coat.

04:43.940 --> 04:46.730
Hey, if anybody could
pull it off, it'd be you.

04:47.760 --> 04:50.010
did you make the call?

04:50.340 --> 04:52.600
Here. Her name's alexis.

04:52.610 --> 04:54.740
She's expecting to hear from you.

04:54.750 --> 04:56.790
Alexis-- that-that's
a pretty name.

04:56.810 --> 04:58.620
They all have pretty names, alan.

04:58.640 --> 05:01.420
You'll meet a hooker named maude.

05:01.930 --> 05:04.170
Right, right. So, uh...

05:04.180 --> 05:06.270
so exactly how much
are we talking about?

05:06.280 --> 05:08.740
She's willing to throw you one for 500.

05:08.750 --> 05:10.250
Uh, okay.

05:11.230 --> 05:14.140
can I put it on a credit card?

05:14.810 --> 05:16.570
A credit card?

05:16.580 --> 05:19.600
Where are you planning
to swipe it, alan?

05:20.380 --> 05:24.000
All right, all right. I was
just... hoping to get the miles.

05:27.170 --> 05:29.550
Forget the miles.

05:29.560 --> 05:32.280
And remember, that 500
does not include the tip.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.460
I have to tip her?

05:33.470 --> 05:36.200
You know, in case there's something
you want that might be considered...

05:36.210 --> 05:38.030
unusual.

05:38.040 --> 05:40.530
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna have to tip her.

05:42.940 --> 05:44.840
- hey, berta.
- Hey, berta.

05:44.850 --> 05:47.850
So what you're saying
is that, uh, this is A...

05:47.870 --> 05:51.160
a la carte kind of deal,
like a, like a steakhouse?

05:51.380 --> 05:52.940
What?

05:53.440 --> 05:57.290
As opposed to a, uh...
set menu or buffet style.

05:57.300 --> 05:59.290
Sure, whatev.

05:59.300 --> 06:01.610
Should I, uh, mention
your name when I call?

06:01.630 --> 06:02.820
Absolutely.

06:02.830 --> 06:06.000
For every referral, I
get a free travel mug.

06:07.110 --> 06:08.980
Terrific. Thank you, charlie.

06:08.990 --> 06:10.700
Happy to help.

06:10.710 --> 06:13.090
Zippy getting a hooker?

06:14.870 --> 06:15.890
It would appear so.

06:15.900 --> 06:19.300
Boy, talk about earning your money.

06:20.700 --> 06:23.560
Look, all you got to do is call her
mother, talk to her for a few minutes,

06:23.580 --> 06:26.630
then ask if milly's there, and
if she is, you hand me the phone.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.420
You're not going to
let this go, are you?

06:28.430 --> 06:30.140
Did you get a look at her?

06:30.160 --> 06:32.560
Jake, buddy, I don't even
know her mother's name.

06:32.570 --> 06:33.400
So?

06:33.420 --> 06:35.630
You don't know the name of
half the girls you bring over.

06:35.650 --> 06:38.680
First month I was here,
you called me jack.

06:40.790 --> 06:42.780
all right. All right.

06:42.790 --> 06:47.030
I will call her, dance around the fact
that I have no idea who the hell she is,

06:47.040 --> 06:48.420
then I'll hand you the phone.

06:48.430 --> 06:49.520
Great.

06:49.530 --> 06:52.110
- Listen, as long as you're hooking people...
- forget it.

06:53.160 --> 06:57.530
Aw, come on. I'm not picky, just
find me a young andy griffith.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.270
Just remember, I'm doing you a favor.

07:02.290 --> 07:05.950
Don't forget it in a few years
when I ask you to change my diaper.

07:05.960 --> 07:09.340
Okay. Wait. What?

07:10.210 --> 07:11.980
It's charlie.

07:11.990 --> 07:14.170
Yeah, it was great to see you too.

07:14.210 --> 07:16.070
Listen, let me tell
you why I'm calling...

07:16.080 --> 07:18.480
I'm sitting here with my nephew...

07:18.490 --> 07:21.370
yeah, he does like his cake.

07:21.700 --> 07:23.320
Remind her I'm in a band.

07:23.330 --> 07:24.980
Hang on.

07:24.990 --> 07:26.100
You gonna let me do this?

07:26.110 --> 07:27.990
You're rambling.

07:28.350 --> 07:31.490
Fine. It's all yours.

07:34.180 --> 07:37.080
Hello. Is... is milly there?

07:37.450 --> 07:41.750
Oh, okay. Well, can you tell her that
jake harper called-- the kid with the band?

07:42.810 --> 07:45.800
Really? Sure, I guess so.

07:45.810 --> 07:47.770
Okay, thanks. Bye.

07:47.780 --> 07:51.200
You and me are having dinner with
them on friday, so you can catch up.

07:51.890 --> 07:53.420
You and me?

07:53.430 --> 07:56.250
Just don't clock block me, okay?

07:59.550 --> 08:01.490
"Clock block" you?

08:01.500 --> 08:03.410
That's not it?

08:03.970 --> 08:06.770
No, that's not it.

08:11.550 --> 08:13.840
Jake, let's go!

08:20.280 --> 08:21.850
How do I look?

08:21.860 --> 08:26.160
Like you should be knocking on doors,
asking people if they've heard the good news!

08:27.620 --> 08:30.400
I already told all my
friends I have a date.

08:31.620 --> 08:34.650
I wasn't going to where the jacket,
but the shirt has mustard on the back.

08:34.659 --> 08:37.039
How did you get mustard
on the back of your shirt?

08:37.049 --> 08:39.809
A kid bet me I cldn't catch
a hot dog behind my back.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.870
It turns out, I couldn'T.

08:43.110 --> 08:45.750
is that what you're wearing?

08:45.760 --> 08:47.050
What's wrong with it?

08:47.060 --> 08:48.150
Nothing, it's fine.

08:48.160 --> 08:51.820
No, no. No, no, please, mr.
Blackwell, I want your opinion.

08:51.830 --> 08:53.880
Well, would it kill you
to tuck your shirt in?

08:53.890 --> 08:57.780
I would, but I just sat in
some thousand island dressing.

08:58.650 --> 09:01.300
Been there, done thaT.

09:01.310 --> 09:02.820
Get in the car.

09:02.830 --> 09:04.540
Alan, we're leaving.

09:04.550 --> 09:06.610
Okay. Have fun.

09:06.620 --> 09:10.660
I'm going on a double date with
pumpkinhead-- fun's not an option.

09:10.670 --> 09:11.960
Well, whatever.

09:11.970 --> 09:12.960
I know it means a lot to him.

09:12.970 --> 09:16.930
That's good... 'cause his
happiness is everything to me.

09:16.940 --> 09:19.110
Uh, uh, charlie? Wait.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.370
Yeah.

09:20.380 --> 09:22.510
Guess who's coming over tonight?

09:22.520 --> 09:24.450
Alexis.

09:24.460 --> 09:26.230
Good for you.

09:26.240 --> 09:28.340
But if you're planning
to use that vegetable oil,

09:28.350 --> 09:31.050
it's probably going to
run you an extra hundred.

09:32.010 --> 09:34.070
I'm making french fries. You know?

09:34.080 --> 09:37.710
Carb loading for my
upcoming 60-minute dash.

09:37.720 --> 09:38.890
My mistake.

09:38.910 --> 09:40.020
But I like how you think...

09:40.030 --> 09:42.490
kinky and heart arar

09:42.960 --> 09:43.560
right.

09:43.570 --> 09:45.480
Oh, wait, wait. One more thing.

09:45.790 --> 09:48.050
Is this like parking at the mall?

09:48.070 --> 09:48.830
What?

09:48.840 --> 09:53.010
If I go over five minutes, do I
have to pay for a whole other hour?

09:53.850 --> 09:56.030
No, it's like a tollbooth.

09:56.040 --> 10:00.670
At the end of the hour, a gate comes
down and lops off your penis. Have fun.

10:04.160 --> 10:08.220
Do me a favor, if you get a chance,
ask milly what her mother's name is.

10:08.230 --> 10:09.980
Why don't you ask her?

10:09.990 --> 10:12.970
Because women don't like it
when you forget their names.

10:12.980 --> 10:15.490
Well, then why do you always do it?

10:15.500 --> 10:19.390
Why do you always eat pastrami
when you know it gives you gas?

10:19.400 --> 10:21.570
'Cause I love pastrami.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.810
Well, there you go.

10:22.820 --> 10:25.850
But I always know it's called pastrami.

10:25.860 --> 10:27.280
Just ask her.

10:27.290 --> 10:28.880
Okay.

10:28.890 --> 10:31.530
Now, let's talk about your date.

10:31.540 --> 10:34.150
You need to get your ducks in a
row before we get to the restaurant.

10:34.190 --> 10:35.020
What do you mean?

10:35.030 --> 10:38.580
Well, if this little girl's important
to you, it'd behoove you to have a plan.

10:38.590 --> 10:40.620
"Behoove"?

10:40.630 --> 10:42.430
It would benefit you.

10:42.440 --> 10:43.640
Oh, yeah, sure.

10:43.660 --> 10:45.710
What was that thing about ducks?

10:45.720 --> 10:47.080
It's just an expression.

10:47.090 --> 10:48.300
Well, it's confusing.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.180
Sorry.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.310
You can't get 'em in a row.

10:51.320 --> 10:52.930
I know, I know. Now,
just listen to me...

10:52.940 --> 10:54.420
they're ducks.

10:54.440 --> 10:55.210
Right.

10:55.220 --> 10:57.770
They move willy-nilly.

10:57.780 --> 10:59.500
Shut up.

11:00.230 --> 11:03.510
It would behoove you
to speak nicer to me.

11:04.700 --> 11:08.160
I swear to god, I will open the
sunroof, pick you up with one hand

11:08.170 --> 11:10.850
and toss you into the carpool lane.

11:12.930 --> 11:16.790
You know, there's no reason we
couldn't be in the carpool lane.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.880
All right, all right, I'm listening.

11:21.350 --> 11:23.500
Thank you.

11:23.510 --> 11:25.580
Now, three rules.

11:25.590 --> 11:28.830
Number one: Dinner with a
beautiful woman is never about food.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.960
I know, it's about making her like me.

11:30.970 --> 11:32.640
Very good.

11:32.650 --> 11:35.510
But there will be food, right?

11:35.520 --> 11:36.390
Yes.

11:36.400 --> 11:39.510
'Cause I'm not at my
best when I'm hungry.

11:39.520 --> 11:41.610
Jake, you need to focus here.

11:41.630 --> 11:44.830
It would behoove me to focus.

11:46.970 --> 11:49.580
Sorry. What are the other two rules?

11:49.590 --> 11:52.010
Number two: Eat with your mouth closed.

11:52.020 --> 11:55.360
Number three: Pray she
has low self-esteem.

11:55.580 --> 11:57.030
Number three isn't a rule.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.820
For you it is.

11:58.830 --> 11:59.720
Fine.

11:59.740 --> 12:02.510
Now let's go over my three rules.

12:02.520 --> 12:03.890
you've got rules?

12:03.920 --> 12:09.280
Number one: I'd like you not to call me
mr. Potato head or spongebob smearpants.

12:10.240 --> 12:13.010
How about sir farts alot?

12:13.040 --> 12:14.620
No.

12:15.700 --> 12:20.220
Number two: I'd think it'd be better if I
call you charlie rather than uncle charlie;

12:20.240 --> 12:22.590
so that way,e'd be more like equals.

12:22.610 --> 12:26.300
So if we're equals, does that mean
you're going to split the check with me?

12:26.950 --> 12:29.570
I knew you'd say that, charlie.

12:30.200 --> 12:33.280
And number three?

12:33.290 --> 12:36.410
Oh, there was only two; I miscounted.

12:38.970 --> 12:43.650
* You don't have to
put on the red light *

12:44.630 --> 12:49.460
* those days are over you don't
have to sell your body to the night *

12:50.310 --> 12:52.260
Oh, wait, you do.

12:57.450 --> 12:59.820
here we go.

12:59.830 --> 13:01.880
Make me proud.

13:07.700 --> 13:09.580
Hey, alan.

13:09.590 --> 13:12.340
Rose... oh, for god's sake.

13:12.350 --> 13:14.030
Did charlie put you up to this?

13:14.040 --> 13:14.770
What are you talking about?

13:14.780 --> 13:16.320
Charlie didn't put me up to anything.

13:16.330 --> 13:17.770
Right.So, it's just a coincidence that

13:17.780 --> 13:21.790
I'm sitting here waiting for a prostitute and
all of a sudden you show up at the front door?

13:21.800 --> 13:25.010
You're waiting for a prostitute?

13:25.020 --> 13:26.870
No.

13:27.470 --> 13:29.840
Oh, alan, that's not like you.

13:29.860 --> 13:32.470
Yeah, well, when you've had
your heart broken enough times

13:32.480 --> 13:35.900
and you can't even bear the thought of having
an emotional connection with another human being,

13:35.910 --> 13:36.860
what else is there to do?

13:36.880 --> 13:39.850
A lot of people masturbate I hear.

13:40.710 --> 13:43.270
Really, I've heard them.

13:43.920 --> 13:48.620
Nevertheless, sometimes a man needs to
feel something other than his own touch.

13:48.640 --> 13:51.760
Have you tried switching hands?

13:51.770 --> 13:55.330
It's like being with a clumsy stranger.

13:58.160 --> 14:00.950
You must be alan's prostitute.

14:00.960 --> 14:01.860
I'm rose.

14:01.880 --> 14:02.740
Hi, rose.

14:02.750 --> 14:04.330
Will you be joining us tonight?

14:04.350 --> 14:05.000
No.

14:05.030 --> 14:07.790
You'll just be doing alan this evening.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.120
- Good night, rose.
- Good night.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.230
So, uh, come on in.

14:12.240 --> 14:13.440
Sorry I'm a little late.

14:13.450 --> 14:15.370
Oh, that's okay.

14:15.920 --> 14:20.390
As long as it doesn't come out of
my, you know... winky-dink time.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.920
charlie, you haven't changed
a bit in all these years.

14:25.940 --> 14:28.710
It has been years, hasn't it?

14:28.720 --> 14:30.970
How many years do you think it's been?

14:30.980 --> 14:33.770
I don't know, probably 12.

14:34.230 --> 14:35.700
And how old are you, honey?

14:35.710 --> 14:36.900
Fourteen.

14:36.920 --> 14:38.930
Thank heaven.

14:39.510 --> 14:42.530
"For leetle girls."

14:42.540 --> 14:44.170
So, milly, do you play dodgeball?

14:44.180 --> 14:45.030
No.

14:45.040 --> 14:49.960
I enjoy it quite a bit because it's just
man against man, but with big red balls.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.340
- Ix-nay on the
allsbay. - What?

14:54.350 --> 14:56.670
Just don't say balls.

14:57.950 --> 14:59.680
So...

15:00.060 --> 15:03.010
are you... living in the same place?

15:03.020 --> 15:04.490
Yeah, still in my condo.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.310
Right, the condo.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.940
Boy, that takes me back.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.480
I don't think you were ever there.

15:09.490 --> 15:11.860
That's what I meant.

15:14.480 --> 15:18.830
It takes me back to not being there.

15:18.840 --> 15:21.530
The thing about dodge...

15:22.540 --> 15:26.740
round things, is the thrill of competition
and the deep satisfaction you get

15:26.750 --> 15:30.900
when you see a kid's retainer fly out of
his mouth when he takes one to the face.

15:30.910 --> 15:32.000
I hate dodgeball.

15:32.020 --> 15:33.090
It's too violent.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.380
You're right, it sucks.

15:37.120 --> 15:40.240
Milly enjoys painting
and writing poetry.

15:40.290 --> 15:41.790
You know, like me.

15:41.800 --> 15:42.840
Of course I know.

15:42.860 --> 15:44.890
How could I not know?

15:44.900 --> 15:48.050
So, are you still doing
the whole art thing?

15:48.070 --> 15:49.220
What do you mean?

15:49.230 --> 15:53.070
I mean the thing you
used to do with the art...

15:53.080 --> 15:55.440
and the poetry.

15:55.450 --> 15:58.190
Milly, did jake tell you he's in a band?

15:58.200 --> 16:00.430
Yeah, I'm in a band.

16:02.320 --> 16:05.400
I don't think she has low self-esteem.

16:08.550 --> 16:11.040
shall we take care of
business before we get started?

16:11.050 --> 16:14.930
Oh, oh, absolutely.
No... no money, no honey.

16:15.850 --> 16:18.630
No... no lootie, no bootie.

16:19.780 --> 16:22.980
No cash advance, I'm not in your pants.

16:24.890 --> 16:27.080
- That was $400, right?
- Five.

16:27.090 --> 16:30.210
Oh, of course. Why did
I think it was four?

16:33.230 --> 16:36.880
Thanks. So, alan...

16:37.330 --> 16:38.710
what do you like?

16:38.720 --> 16:41.280
Oh, just about anything.
I'm not finicky.

16:41.290 --> 16:43.830
Ooh, no limits, huh?

16:43.840 --> 16:46.940
Well, you know, I'm
not into animals or...

16:46.950 --> 16:49.670
anything near my keister.

16:50.270 --> 16:53.410
Okay, come here.

16:53.430 --> 16:55.100
Let's get comfy.

16:55.110 --> 16:56.880
Oh, all righty.

16:58.530 --> 17:02.950
oh, baby, you really turn me on.

17:02.960 --> 17:05.319
- Uh, uh, hang on a sec.
- What?

17:05.660 --> 17:08.700
I'm a little bumped by
that "turn me on" part.

17:08.710 --> 17:14.170
I mean, I want believe you, but I've been with
enough women to know that it doesn't happen that fast.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.410
Sometimes it doesn't happen at all.

17:17.420 --> 17:19.680
Honey, I would not lie to you.

17:19.700 --> 17:23.099
No, no, of course not. Why
would you lie to me? But...

17:24.710 --> 17:31.180
I'm just saying, it-it would help if you could
tone down the narration to a more believable level.

17:31.190 --> 17:32.830
All right.

17:36.410 --> 17:39.400
Mm, you are the best kisser.

17:39.410 --> 17:41.370
Okay, again...

17:42.090 --> 17:45.190
I happen to know for a fact
that I'm not the best kisser.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.370
Okay, I'm a little confused here.

17:47.380 --> 17:48.900
I'm just not buying it.

17:48.930 --> 17:52.320
And since I am buying it,
I should be able to buy it.

17:53.670 --> 17:55.250
All you have to do is tell the truth.

17:55.260 --> 17:57.990
- There's no need for hyperbole.
- All right.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.980
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:00.820 --> 18:04.960
oh, alan, your lips are so...

18:05.430 --> 18:07.940
thin and dry.

18:10.150 --> 18:12.650
Okay, now we're cookin'.

18:14.250 --> 18:19.200
I think competitive eating really changed when
that japanese guy started wetting the hot dog buns.

18:19.210 --> 18:21.460
I actually figured out
that trick myself...

18:21.470 --> 18:23.800
by accident.

18:24.860 --> 18:26.300
So...

18:26.310 --> 18:27.630
how are your folks doing?

18:27.640 --> 18:29.000
That's not funny, charlie.

18:29.020 --> 18:34.100
No, I-I-I meant, how are
they doing... in heaven?

18:34.110 --> 18:35.630
What are you talking about?

18:35.640 --> 18:37.620
Hell?

18:37.630 --> 18:39.290
Are you referring to their divorce?

18:39.300 --> 18:40.300
Yes, I am.

18:40.310 --> 18:41.500
And divorce is hell.

18:41.510 --> 18:43.080
But after awhile it can be like heaven.

18:43.090 --> 18:45.380
You know, you're even
prettier than I remember.

18:45.400 --> 18:46.520
Thank you.

18:46.530 --> 18:49.080
And you are just as charming
as the first time we met.

18:49.100 --> 18:50.300
Oh, you don't remember that.

18:50.310 --> 18:52.390
I sure do-- it was a
really hot day in july...

18:52.400 --> 18:55.140
in my opinion, the hot
dog eaters are amateurs.

18:55.150 --> 18:59.120
The guys who do pork ribs and
spaghetti, they're the real athletes.

19:00.170 --> 19:02.720
Hey, hey, hey, the lady's talking here.

19:02.730 --> 19:06.720
Oh, right-- milly, charlie wants
to know what your mom's name is.

19:08.360 --> 19:10.120
You don't remember my name?

19:10.130 --> 19:12.220
What? Of course I do.

19:12.230 --> 19:15.610
You're gonna listen to
"spongebob smearpants"?

19:16.560 --> 19:18.320
oh, you want play like that, huh?

19:18.330 --> 19:21.860
Mister... drunky-face.

19:21.870 --> 19:23.040
What's my name, charlie?

19:23.060 --> 19:24.180
Just a sec.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.420
How's your lobster, sweetheart?

19:25.430 --> 19:28.800
You need more butter, 'cause
there's plenty on jake's shirt.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.590
You have no idea what
my name is, do you?

19:31.600 --> 19:34.000
He doesn't have a clue.

19:34.010 --> 19:36.670
Okay, okay, okay, I'm
not good with names,

19:36.680 --> 19:39.760
but I'll never forget the
passionate nights we spent together.

19:39.790 --> 19:41.500
We never spent the night together.

19:41.510 --> 19:43.110
- We didt?
- No.

19:43.120 --> 19:45.930
Well, no wonder I don't remember you.

19:45.940 --> 19:47.500
Come on, honey, we're leaving.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.080
No, no, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

19:50.090 --> 19:51.510
I gotta know...

19:51.540 --> 19:53.980
who the hell are you?

19:54.840 --> 19:55.920
Nice going.

19:55.930 --> 19:58.670
Me? You're putting this on me?

19:58.680 --> 20:00.390
Can I bring you anything else?

20:00.410 --> 20:04.830
Yeah, get me a bottle of
scotch, a taxi and a smarter kid.

20:05.390 --> 20:08.400
Can I have a chocolate mousse, please.

20:10.950 --> 20:15.430
alan: Oh, come on. I just said I can't
believe I'm the biggtt u've ever seen.

20:16.100 --> 20:20.530
I mean, I'm not even the biggest I've
ever seen and I haven't seen that many.

20:20.550 --> 20:22.610
- I'm sorry, I have to go.
- Why?

20:22.990 --> 20:24.200
I have a headache.

20:24.210 --> 20:26.520
I can work with that-- i
was married for 12 years.

20:26.530 --> 20:30.470
Here's your money.
Don't ever call me again.

20:34.750 --> 20:37.840
Okay. Second base for free.

20:54.580 --> 20:58.040
so, are either of you gonna
tell me how it went tonight?

20:58.050 --> 21:00.080
Ask your bubbleheaded son.

21:00.100 --> 21:02.780
Ask your butt-headed brother.

21:03.150 --> 21:06.130
You know what? I'm not that interested.

21:06.140 --> 21:08.210
I'm going to bed.

21:08.880 --> 21:10.480
Oh, no, stay.

21:10.490 --> 21:12.820
I so enjoy your company.

21:16.550 --> 21:19.270
So, how'd it go with alexis?

21:19.280 --> 21:24.810
Well, uh, I don't want to brag,
but, uh, she wouldn't take my money.
