07:36.155 --> 07:39.455
The gandarium are
a genetically engineered life-form...

to us in simpler terms?

07:57.009 --> 07:59.000
All right. Uh-

07:59.078 --> 08:02.946
Let's say you want to create
an alien-human hybrid.

08:03.015 --> 08:06.974
First, you get some alien cells;
then you get some human cells.

08:07.053 --> 08:09.283
Normally they don't mix
very well.

08:09.355 --> 08:12.347
You need something to help
bridge the differences.

08:12.425 --> 08:15.326
That's where
the gandarium come in.

08:15.394 --> 08:19.092
In a controlled environment,
like on your ship, they're harmless.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.497
But released into an ecosystem...

08:21.567 --> 08:24.195
the gandarium will perform
the only role they know-

08:24.270 --> 08:26.432
infect human cells.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.974
But they're not infecting
just any human cells.

08:30.042 --> 08:32.635
They seem to be focusing
on one particular girl.

08:32.712 --> 08:36.511
Not every human is
a candidate for hybridization.

08:36.582 --> 08:39.017
Their genetic structure
has to have-

08:39.085 --> 08:43.453
Well, you would call it a flaw.
It's very rare on Earth.

08:43.523 --> 08:47.482
Fewer than one in 5O million
people have it.

08:47.560 --> 08:51.155
That's why they're going after Laurie.
She must have the defect.

08:51.230 --> 08:54.029
What happens if they succeed
in infecting Laurie?

08:54.100 --> 08:58.503
Well, once they've infected her, the gandarium
will mutate into a universal virus.

08:58.571 --> 09:02.599
She'll infect anyone she comes into
contact with, human or otherwise.

09:02.675 --> 09:06.737
They, in turn, will affect everyone
they come into contact with.

09:06.812 --> 09:11.374
Eventually, she and every infected person
on the planet will die.

09:14.086 --> 09:18.045
- How do I destroy them?
- Once they've infected the host, it's all over.

09:19.959 --> 09:22.553
They didn't finish.

09:22.628 --> 09:25.689
The gandarium didn't
finish infecting Laurie.

09:25.765 --> 09:29.133
- She was buried right out there with the crystals.
- I think that Tess is right.

09:29.201 --> 09:32.466
That's why they're still coming after her,
to complete the process.

09:32.538 --> 09:35.405
If that's true, then you may
still have a chance.

09:35.474 --> 09:40.571
The gandarium are hivelike,
with workers, drones, even a queen.

09:40.646 --> 09:43.741
The queen is the only one
that can infect a host.

09:43.816 --> 09:47.309
Find her, kill her
and the rest of the hive will die.

09:47.386 --> 09:50.720
- So the queen will be in the hive.
- Not necessarily.

09:50.790 --> 09:54.192
I have to return this body
to its home or it won't survive.
