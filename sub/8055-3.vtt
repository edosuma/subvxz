WEBVTT

00:00.463 --> 00:02.830
Okay, Jerry, what have you chosen

00:02.831 --> 00:03.898
to put in the time capsule?

00:03.899 --> 00:05.965
These are my mother's diaries.

00:06.033 --> 00:07.167
Wow.

00:07.234 --> 00:08.635
Yeah, she lived in Pawnee
all of her life

00:08.702 --> 00:10.570
and recorded everything
she ever did.

00:10.638 --> 00:11.704
Yeah, so it's, you know,
kind of like

00:11.772 --> 00:13.339
a living document about the town.

00:13.407 --> 00:14.541
Hmm.

00:14.608 --> 00:16.709
A disappointingly
good idea from Jerry.

00:16.777 --> 00:18.144
Better than good, Jerry.
Perfect.

00:18.212 --> 00:19.746
Give me that.

00:19.813 --> 00:22.415
"January 18, 1964.

00:22.483 --> 00:25.518
"Jerrold starred in his school
production of <i>Peter Pan.</i>

00:25.586 --> 00:27.520
He was a beautiful
Tinker Bell."

00:29.056 --> 00:30.790
It was an all-boys school.

00:34.395 --> 00:37.797
Jerry!

00:37.865 --> 00:38.898
Hey, Leslie, I have an idea.

00:38.966 --> 00:40.767
Why don't we put Eduardo in there

00:40.834 --> 00:44.437
and seal the top so
that he suffocates and dies?

00:44.505 --> 00:46.673
Okay, Tom, you're up.

00:46.740 --> 00:48.975
For my item, I chose a picture

00:49.043 --> 00:51.110
of my ex-girlfriend Lucy

00:51.178 --> 00:53.012
with a mustache drawn on her face

00:53.080 --> 00:55.415
and stink lines coming off her,
'cause she stinks.

00:55.482 --> 00:57.984
She broke up with me.
Didn't really tell me why.

00:58.052 --> 00:59.285
Luckily, when you're the guy,

00:59.353 --> 01:00.853
you can just tell people
she's crazy.

01:00.921 --> 01:03.223
"Hey, Tom, I heard you
and Lucy broke up."

01:03.290 --> 01:05.892
"Yeah, man.
Turns out she's crazy."

01:05.960 --> 01:08.228
That's what they always do
on <i>Entourage.</i>

01:08.295 --> 01:09.662
Ron?

01:09.730 --> 01:11.030
I am submitting this menu

01:11.098 --> 01:13.633
from a Pawnee institution,
JJ's diner,

01:13.701 --> 01:15.935
home of the world's best
breakfast dish,

01:16.003 --> 01:18.605
the four horse meals
of the egg-pork-alypse.

01:18.672 --> 01:20.206
Wendy loves it too.

01:20.274 --> 01:22.909
And I am submitting this.

01:22.977 --> 01:26.012
A brief history of everything
that has ever happened

01:26.080 --> 01:27.280
since Pawnee was founded.

01:27.348 --> 01:29.249
Not like you get
extra credit for this,

01:29.316 --> 01:30.717
but I did type it from memory.

01:30.784 --> 01:32.452
And for the first
time ever compiled,

01:32.519 --> 01:34.921
it includes a complete list

01:34.989 --> 01:37.290
of every official town slogan
we've ever had.

01:37.358 --> 01:38.625
- Oh, my God, Leslie.
- I know. Can you believe it?

01:38.692 --> 01:40.260
- That's crazy.
- Isn't it?

01:40.327 --> 01:42.729
"Pawnee:
The Paris of America.

01:42.763 --> 01:45.632
"Pawnee: The Akron
of Southwest Indiana.

01:45.699 --> 01:48.334
Pawnee:
Welcome, German soldiers."

01:48.402 --> 01:51.504
After the Nazis took France,
our mayor kind of panicked.

01:51.572 --> 01:53.840
"Pawnee: The factory fire
capital of America.

01:53.907 --> 01:56.509
"Pawnee: Welcome,
Vietnamese soldiers.

01:56.577 --> 01:58.678
Pawnee: Engage with Zorp."

01:58.746 --> 02:00.346
For a brief time in the '70s,

02:00.414 --> 02:02.215
our town
was taken over by a cult.

02:02.283 --> 02:04.817
"Pawnee: Zorp is dead.
Long live Zorp.

02:04.885 --> 02:06.919
"Pawnee: It's safe
to be here now.

02:06.987 --> 02:09.589
Pawnee: Birthplace
of Julia Roberts."

02:09.657 --> 02:11.891
That was a lie, she sued,
and so we had to change it.

02:11.959 --> 02:13.993
"Pawnee:
Home of the world-famous

02:14.061 --> 02:15.561
"Julia Roberts lawsuit.

02:15.629 --> 02:18.264
Pawnee:
Welcome, Taliban soldiers."

02:18.332 --> 02:20.166
And finally, our current slogan:

02:20.234 --> 02:23.736
"Pawnee: First in friendship,
fourth in obesity."

02:26.807 --> 02:37.247
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:44.867 --> 02:46.927
Yes, Pawnee has had
its set of problems,

02:46.928 --> 02:50.022
but this time capsule
is our way of saying

02:50.023 --> 02:53.125
that Pawnee is gonna be around
for a long time...

02:53.193 --> 02:54.293
Capsule.

02:54.988 --> 02:56.322
And you can quote me on that.

02:56.389 --> 02:57.990
Oh, I'm actually gonna
quote you on all of this,

02:58.058 --> 02:59.358
'cause it's a newspaper article.

02:59.426 --> 03:00.559
- I thought of a great headline.
- Great.

03:00.627 --> 03:03.262
It's time to encapsulate
the future.

03:03.330 --> 03:04.763
- Good one.
- Sub headline:

03:04.831 --> 03:06.332
The parks department
cuts the crapsule,

03:06.399 --> 03:07.766
buries the time capsule.

03:07.834 --> 03:09.168
I'll be back tomorrow
with the photographer.

03:09.236 --> 03:10.703
Okay.

03:10.770 --> 03:12.571
Leslie, this guy's here.

03:12.639 --> 03:14.306
Hi.
Can I help you?

03:14.374 --> 03:15.708
I'm Kelly Larson.

03:15.775 --> 03:17.276
I read online
about your time capsule,

03:17.344 --> 03:18.811
and I'm here to make
a suggestion.

03:18.879 --> 03:20.379
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're not taking sugges...

03:20.447 --> 03:21.780
The <i>Twilight</i> books.

03:21.848 --> 03:23.649
It's a beautifully-told saga
of vampires,

03:23.717 --> 03:25.150
werewolves, and romance.

03:25.218 --> 03:26.986
Ah, you are the person
that's been emailing me

03:27.053 --> 03:28.621
about <i>Twilight.</i>

03:28.688 --> 03:30.756
I thought you would be younger...

03:30.824 --> 03:32.091
And a girl.

03:32.158 --> 03:33.926
Well, I'm not.
I'm older and a boy.

03:33.994 --> 03:36.362
But I feel very strongly
that these should be included.

03:36.429 --> 03:38.464
Can I tell you why?

03:38.531 --> 03:39.531
Sure, Kelly.
Have a seat.

03:39.599 --> 03:41.100
- Awesome.
- And plead your case.

03:41.167 --> 03:44.036
Thanks.
Okay, Christmas Eve, 1973.

03:44.104 --> 03:46.005
Author Stephenie Meyer,
nee Morgan,

03:46.072 --> 03:47.473
was born in Hartford,
Connecticut.

03:47.540 --> 03:50.576
Oh, you're going all
the way back to her birth. Okay.

03:50.644 --> 03:52.845
So basically, Ann kissed me

03:52.913 --> 03:55.514
and then April kissed me,
and I told April,

03:55.582 --> 03:57.850
because of honesty is important.

03:57.918 --> 03:59.485
That's so true.

03:59.552 --> 04:00.986
But now she's gone
and gotten herself

04:01.054 --> 04:02.888
a Venezuelan boyfriend
who's, like,

04:02.956 --> 04:04.790
the handsomest dude
I've ever seen.

04:04.858 --> 04:06.458
Present company excluded.

04:06.526 --> 04:08.027
Oh, thank you.

04:08.094 --> 04:09.962
Uh, I was talking about me.

04:10.030 --> 04:11.664
Hey.

04:11.731 --> 04:12.865
Ann Perkins!

04:12.933 --> 04:14.667
Andy just gave me
a phenomenal shoeshine

04:14.734 --> 04:17.269
and I did not know that
you two once lived together.

04:17.337 --> 04:19.137
Yes.
Yes, we did.

04:19.204 --> 04:22.041
Thank you for catching him up
on our history.

04:22.108 --> 04:23.909
Andy, that was
an amazing shoeshine.

04:23.977 --> 04:28.213
I can literally see my face
in my shoes.

04:28.281 --> 04:29.581
See you later!

04:29.649 --> 04:30.883
He didn't...
he didn't pay me.

04:30.951 --> 04:32.251
Why are you hanging out
with Chris?

04:32.319 --> 04:33.485
He just sat down.

04:33.553 --> 04:34.887
What am I supposed to do?
He's my boss.

04:34.955 --> 04:36.755
- No, he's not.
- He isn't?

04:36.823 --> 04:38.524
God dang it.

04:38.591 --> 04:40.826
I cannot figure out
who my boss is.

04:40.894 --> 04:42.194
Andy, I like this guy.

04:42.262 --> 04:45.164
Please don't do anything weird,
I beg you.

04:45.231 --> 04:48.000
I just started dating Chris,
and I don't know how,

04:48.068 --> 04:49.802
but Andy's gonna screw it up.

04:49.869 --> 04:51.537
Andy screws everything up.

04:51.604 --> 04:53.472
When we were dating,
I bought him a fish

04:53.540 --> 04:55.074
and I don't want to get into it,

04:55.141 --> 04:58.844
but somehow that fish ended up
dead in a cowboy boot.

04:58.912 --> 05:00.379
And combined,
they have sold more than

05:00.447 --> 05:02.748
100 million copies worldwide.

05:02.816 --> 05:04.917
Now, have you seen any
of the <i>Twilight</i> movies?

05:04.985 --> 05:06.285
No, I have not.

05:06.353 --> 05:08.320
Well, let me describe them
to you shot-for-shot.

05:08.388 --> 05:10.456
Movie number one.
<i>Twilight.</i>

05:10.523 --> 05:12.758
We slowly pan up over a mossy log

05:12.826 --> 05:14.860
to see a deer drinking
crystal-clear water.

05:14.928 --> 05:17.162
Okay, Kelly, this time capsule

05:17.230 --> 05:20.299
isn't just a barrel full
of stuff that people like.

05:20.367 --> 05:23.469
It's about life in Pawnee
at this moment in time,

05:23.536 --> 05:25.504
and there is nothing
in <i>Twilight</i>

05:25.572 --> 05:27.272
that is specific to Pawnee.

05:27.340 --> 05:28.640
I disagree, okay?

05:28.708 --> 05:31.043
The town of Forks, Washington
is exactly like Pawnee,

05:31.111 --> 05:34.380
except for the climate
and the vampires.

05:34.447 --> 05:35.948
I'm sorry.
I have to say no.

05:36.016 --> 05:37.616
I beg you to reconsider.

05:37.684 --> 05:38.951
And I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

05:39.019 --> 05:41.954
Then I'm gonna have to do this.

05:47.961 --> 05:48.894
He brought handcuffs with him.

05:48.962 --> 05:50.396
This whole thing was planned.

05:50.463 --> 05:51.997
I think it's kind of cool.

05:52.065 --> 05:53.365
It's not cool.

05:53.433 --> 05:55.267
It's trespassing,
and that is breaking the rules.

05:55.335 --> 05:57.269
Cool people make the rules.
They don't break the rules.

05:57.337 --> 05:58.704
And if those kids want you
to break the rules,

05:58.772 --> 05:59.905
then they aren't
really your friends.

05:59.973 --> 06:01.740
Whoa, who are you even
talking about?

06:01.808 --> 06:03.008
I don't know.
I'm sorry. I'm just annoyed.

06:03.076 --> 06:04.676
But while we're on the subject,

06:04.744 --> 06:06.945
your friend Orrin with the long
black nails and the cloak?

06:07.013 --> 06:07.946
He concerns me.

06:08.014 --> 06:09.381
He's a genius.

06:09.449 --> 06:11.650
I'll care of this trespasser.

06:11.718 --> 06:13.652
Give me 30 seconds.

06:13.720 --> 06:14.887
I'm just gonna call security.

06:14.954 --> 06:17.423
Guys, can we push
the meeting an hour?

06:17.490 --> 06:18.891
What's going on?

06:18.958 --> 06:21.026
Some guy handcuffed himself
to a pipe in my office

06:21.094 --> 06:22.628
because we wouldn't put
a copy of <i>Twilight</i>

06:22.695 --> 06:23.762
in the time capsule.

06:23.830 --> 06:25.998
Damn it. Again?

06:27.934 --> 06:29.435
You look sad.

06:29.502 --> 06:30.602
You look like a weird goon

06:30.670 --> 06:32.204
who's obsessed with a kid's book.

06:32.272 --> 06:33.405
It's a girl, isn't it?

06:33.473 --> 06:35.107
I can tell.

06:35.175 --> 06:36.675
It's the look that Mike
had on his face

06:36.743 --> 06:38.544
when Bella turned him down
for the dance.

06:38.611 --> 06:40.145
Oh, yeah? Is it?

06:40.213 --> 06:41.513
What look did your mom
have on her face

06:41.581 --> 06:43.682
when she realized her son
was a complete failure?

06:43.750 --> 06:45.651
Okay, I'll be quiet.

06:45.718 --> 06:47.953
But I do know something
about heartbreak.

06:48.021 --> 06:49.354
And you know who else does?

06:49.422 --> 06:52.091
- Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds?
- No.

06:52.158 --> 06:55.394
A little lady named <i>Twilight</i>
<i>author Stephenie Meyer.</i>

06:55.462 --> 06:57.429
Trust me.

06:57.497 --> 06:58.864
You should listen to him.

06:58.932 --> 07:00.732
Those books are good.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.202
Oh, I love any book
about vampires,

07:03.269 --> 07:05.838
werewolves, monsters, zombies,

07:05.905 --> 07:10.008
sorcerers, beasties,
or time-traveling romances.

07:10.076 --> 07:12.444
And if I had an hour alone
with Robert Pattinson,

07:12.512 --> 07:14.646
he would forget all about
Skinnylegs McGee.

07:14.714 --> 07:15.681
I'll tell you that much.

07:15.748 --> 07:17.349
Okay, buddy, time is up.

07:17.417 --> 07:18.617
Give us the keys.

07:18.685 --> 07:20.586
They're hidden somewhere
very far away.

07:20.653 --> 07:21.954
Then we're gonna have
to cut you loose.

07:22.021 --> 07:23.322
Why?
I'm not doing anything wrong.

07:23.389 --> 07:25.224
Yes, you are.
You're trespassing.

07:25.291 --> 07:27.759
Well, the fact remains
this is perfectly legal.

07:27.827 --> 07:29.394
No, it's not.
You're trespassing.

07:29.462 --> 07:31.597
Look, I really don't want
to cause any trouble,

07:31.664 --> 07:33.398
but I am not gonna leave
until you

07:33.466 --> 07:34.766
put <i>Twilight</i>
<i>in the time capsule.</i>

07:34.834 --> 07:36.602
This muscle-headed
storm trooper

07:36.669 --> 07:37.769
doesn't scare me.

07:37.837 --> 07:39.905
Go ahead, Artie.

07:39.973 --> 07:41.406
No! No! No! No! No!

07:41.474 --> 07:44.676
Please! No! No! No! No!
No! No! Get him away from me!

07:44.744 --> 07:46.078
I am very scared of you!

07:46.146 --> 07:47.412
All right!

07:47.480 --> 07:48.947
Okay! All right! All right!
All right!

07:49.015 --> 07:50.282
Stop.

07:50.350 --> 07:51.416
If he wants to stay in there,

07:51.484 --> 07:52.518
I'll let him stay in there.

07:52.585 --> 07:54.319
In two hours,
he's gonna be so hungry

07:54.387 --> 07:59.158
and freaked out,
he's gonna be begging me to...

07:59.225 --> 08:01.093
He brought a pillow.

08:01.161 --> 08:02.528
Hey, Leslie, I'm making
some sleepytime tea.

08:02.595 --> 08:04.630
You want any?

08:07.245 --> 08:09.571
Hey, dude, wake up, man.

08:09.691 --> 08:11.759
Oh, morning, Tom.

08:11.827 --> 08:14.128
<i>Twilight</i> is dope.

08:14.196 --> 08:16.230
- I told you.
- I couldn't put it down.

08:16.298 --> 08:18.332
It was like she was peering
into my soul.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.401
Sing it, friend.
Here.

08:20.469 --> 08:23.270
Book two.
<i>Twilight: New Moon.</i>

08:23.338 --> 08:24.672
Get cracking.

08:24.739 --> 08:26.006
There's a second book?

08:26.074 --> 08:28.309
And a third and a fourth.

08:28.376 --> 08:31.312
No [bleep] way.

08:31.379 --> 08:33.080
- It's fantastic.
- Yeah.

08:33.148 --> 08:35.182
I worked really hard.
I did every pair that I could.

08:35.250 --> 08:37.952
I didn't know
what to do with these.

08:38.019 --> 08:40.087
- I think they're gloves.
- No, no, no, no.

08:40.155 --> 08:41.322
Those are sports sandals.

08:41.389 --> 08:42.789
They're for adventure racing.

08:42.857 --> 08:45.025
They perfectly contour
to the human foot,

08:45.093 --> 08:48.028
and the human foot
is the ultimate technology.

08:48.096 --> 08:49.730
Dude, that is
the coolest sentence

08:49.798 --> 08:51.499
I've ever heard somebody talk.

08:51.566 --> 08:54.168
So you love April,

08:54.236 --> 08:55.503
and she has a new boyfriend,
right?

08:55.570 --> 08:57.671
You got all of that
from a picture?

08:57.739 --> 08:59.773
No, you told me yesterday.
Andy...

08:59.841 --> 09:03.644
I want to help you win her over.

09:03.712 --> 09:04.945
Why do I want to help him?

09:05.013 --> 09:06.647
Because he's a good person.

09:06.715 --> 09:08.282
I love good people.

09:08.350 --> 09:10.784
Hey, you know who should
wear these shoes?

09:10.852 --> 09:12.786
Monkeys.

09:15.190 --> 09:17.458
Well, this is an interesting
turn of events.

09:17.526 --> 09:18.692
Is it?
I-I don't know.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.060
I mean, I guess
it's kind of interesting.

09:20.128 --> 09:21.128
What the real story is

09:21.196 --> 09:23.297
is how wonderful
our time capsule is

09:23.365 --> 09:25.866
and how it perfectly
encapsulates...

09:25.934 --> 09:27.334
a word I really
think you should use...

09:27.402 --> 09:29.370
what our town is all about.

09:29.437 --> 09:30.905
Hey, how's this for a headline?

09:30.972 --> 09:33.507
"Parks department
foiled by pipe dreams."

09:33.575 --> 09:35.643
God, that's an amazing headline,

09:35.710 --> 09:37.311
but please don't
write that story.

09:37.379 --> 09:40.347
The key to April's heart
is within you, Andy.

09:40.415 --> 09:42.216
You need to tap in to the aspects

09:42.284 --> 09:45.052
of your personality
that she once found attractive

09:45.120 --> 09:48.489
to make yourself the best
version of yourself.

09:48.557 --> 09:49.590
What's great about you?

09:49.658 --> 09:51.125
I'm nice.

09:51.192 --> 09:52.693
Good! Nice.

09:52.761 --> 09:54.228
What else?

09:54.296 --> 09:55.362
I'm in a band.

09:55.430 --> 09:57.631
Band!

09:57.699 --> 10:01.468
- What else?
- That's it.

10:01.536 --> 10:03.404
Am I Team Edward?
Yes.

10:03.471 --> 10:06.740
Do I share his concerns
about turning Bella, though?

10:06.808 --> 10:08.142
Absolutely not.

10:08.209 --> 10:10.711
Edward's primary goal
at all times

10:10.779 --> 10:12.146
is Bella's protection.

10:12.213 --> 10:15.316
Can you please,
<i>please</i> be quiet?

10:15.383 --> 10:16.617
Sorry. Sorry.

10:16.685 --> 10:18.953
Please keep it down.
Be considerate.

10:19.020 --> 10:20.321
Look at it this way, Tom.

10:20.388 --> 10:22.323
Bella's love for Edward
is being tested.

10:22.390 --> 10:23.924
By Jacob?

10:23.992 --> 10:25.225
Mm. Not exactly.

10:25.293 --> 10:26.393
- The volturi?
- Yes.

10:26.461 --> 10:27.595
Okay, you know what?
All right.

10:27.662 --> 10:28.862
I'm gonna go do my work
in the conference room,

10:28.930 --> 10:30.931
'cause you guys are the worst.

10:30.999 --> 10:32.900
You seem tense, Leslie.
You know what you should do?

10:32.968 --> 10:34.168
Read <i>Twilight?</i>

10:34.235 --> 10:35.169
Read <i>Twilight.</i>
<i>Here.</i>

10:35.236 --> 10:37.638
Yeah, thanks.

10:37.706 --> 10:39.640
Sometimes I think
she's in the volturi.

10:44.112 --> 10:45.446
Good morning, Kelly.

10:45.513 --> 10:47.114
Oh, morning, Leslie.

10:47.182 --> 10:49.049
Hope you don't mind I moved
myself over to this pipe.

10:49.117 --> 10:50.117
It's a little more comfortable.

10:50.185 --> 10:51.285
No problem.

10:51.353 --> 10:52.353
Did you have a nice night?
Sleep well?

10:52.420 --> 10:53.921
Mm, it was all right,
considering.

10:53.989 --> 10:55.022
Picked you up some coffee.

10:55.090 --> 10:56.290
Thank you so much.

10:56.358 --> 10:57.725
Well, you seem pretty chipper
this morning.

10:57.792 --> 10:58.892
I am, Kelly,

10:58.960 --> 11:02.363
because I know why you're here.

11:02.430 --> 11:04.098
You know what I did last night?

11:04.165 --> 11:05.866
Read <i>Twilight,</i>
<i>and it transformed your life</i>

11:05.934 --> 11:07.468
and you're gonna put it
in the time capsule?

11:07.535 --> 11:09.069
Well, I read the first ten pages.

11:09.137 --> 11:10.604
I couldn't really
get into it, though.

11:10.672 --> 11:12.706
More of a <i>Harry Potter</i>
<i>girl myself.</i>

11:12.774 --> 11:13.974
What?

11:14.042 --> 11:15.442
But I looked at the inside cover,

11:15.510 --> 11:18.178
and I saw this.

11:18.246 --> 11:20.347
Did a little research,
and Liz Waverly

11:20.415 --> 11:22.216
is 12 years old,
a straight "A" student

11:22.283 --> 11:23.384
at King Philip Middle.

11:23.451 --> 11:25.586
She's also a member of many

11:25.654 --> 11:27.287
<i>Twilight</i> Internet
message boards

11:27.355 --> 11:29.923
and I'm guessing your daughter?

11:29.991 --> 11:32.426
Is that why you did this?

11:32.494 --> 11:34.128
To impress your daughter?

11:34.195 --> 11:37.731
Liz's mom and I divorced
a couple years ago,

11:37.799 --> 11:39.233
and it's been really hard on her.

11:39.300 --> 11:41.769
And she loves <i>Twilight</i>
<i>and so...</i>

11:41.836 --> 11:43.604
I read about your time capsule
and I thought

11:43.672 --> 11:45.072
that if I could somehow
convince you

11:45.140 --> 11:47.641
to get it in there,
I'd be a big hero.

11:47.709 --> 11:49.643
That's really sweet.

11:49.711 --> 11:52.613
You should have told me you were
doing this for your daughter.

11:52.681 --> 11:54.481
I didn't want
to drag her into it.

11:54.549 --> 11:56.250
I'm sorry.
This is a mistake.

11:56.317 --> 11:58.485
You don't have to put <i>Twilight</i>
<i>in the time capsule.</i>

12:00.488 --> 12:02.523
I think we should put <i>Twilight</i>
<i>in the time capsule.</i>

12:02.590 --> 12:04.024
Leslie, no.

12:04.092 --> 12:05.893
We don't negotiate with weirdos.

12:05.960 --> 12:08.028
Yeah, what happened to,
"a perfect encapsulation

12:08.096 --> 12:09.463
of life in Pawnee"?

12:09.531 --> 12:11.498
Well, for that guy,
life in Pawnee

12:11.566 --> 12:13.634
is him and his daughter
reading that book.

12:13.702 --> 12:15.569
Besides, I can get Shauna
on board.

12:15.637 --> 12:17.438
It would make a great
human interest story.

12:17.505 --> 12:19.006
Uh, if this gets out,

12:19.074 --> 12:20.741
every time you want
to do anything,

12:20.809 --> 12:22.376
some guy's gonna come
into your office

12:22.444 --> 12:24.044
and handcuff himself to a pipe.

12:24.112 --> 12:27.481
Well, yeah, that's a good point.

12:27.549 --> 12:30.718
Then we shall
bring the pipe to them.

12:30.785 --> 12:31.785
Oh, no.

12:31.853 --> 12:34.354
Oh, yes.

12:34.422 --> 12:35.856
What does that mean?

12:35.924 --> 12:37.891
Crackpot convention.

12:37.959 --> 12:40.527
So that's what
today's forum is for.

12:40.595 --> 12:42.129
We're gonna hear suggestions
from everyone,

12:42.197 --> 12:44.865
and then whichever items
we generally agree on

12:44.933 --> 12:47.735
will go into the time capsule.

12:47.802 --> 12:49.737
Please remember this is
a government project,

12:49.804 --> 12:52.639
so we need to refrain
from corporate promotion

12:52.707 --> 12:53.874
and religious items.

12:53.942 --> 12:55.042
Who'd like to start?

12:55.110 --> 12:57.544
I think we should
put in the Bible.

12:57.612 --> 12:59.313
Great.

13:01.349 --> 13:04.318
Eduardo.

13:04.385 --> 13:05.652
Hi, Eduardo.

13:05.720 --> 13:07.988
I want to apologize.

13:08.056 --> 13:09.690
Just because
you're dating my soul mate

13:09.758 --> 13:12.192
doesn't give me any right
to be a jerk to you.

13:12.260 --> 13:13.527
Um, I promise from now on,

13:13.595 --> 13:16.029
I'm just gonna be...
Super nice to you.

13:16.097 --> 13:17.331
Thank you for saying that.

13:17.398 --> 13:18.599
You're welcome.

13:18.666 --> 13:20.200
Um, what, uh, CDs are those?

13:20.268 --> 13:21.735
Mouse Rat.
My band.

13:21.803 --> 13:23.637
It's our latest album.
Yeah.

13:23.705 --> 13:25.606
You, uh, like music?
What are you listening to?

13:25.673 --> 13:28.242
The Smiths.
Ugh. Very depressing.

13:28.309 --> 13:29.543
April's making you listen
to that?

13:29.611 --> 13:31.078
She's really
into that indie stuff.

13:31.146 --> 13:33.680
I'm more of
a Dave Matthews guy myself.

13:33.748 --> 13:35.616
David Matthews!
<i>Crash into me!</i>

13:35.683 --> 13:38.185
Yes!
I love that song.

13:38.253 --> 13:40.254
Here you go, here.
Take one. Check us out.

13:40.321 --> 13:42.790
We're amazing, so let me know
how much you like us.

13:42.857 --> 13:44.057
Yeah, <i>gracias.</i>

13:44.125 --> 13:46.026
That means "thank you"?

13:46.094 --> 13:48.128
- Yes.
- Nailed it.

13:48.196 --> 13:51.465
So we have one very moving
case for <i>Twilight.</i>

13:51.533 --> 13:53.801
Anyone else?
Great.

13:53.868 --> 13:55.636
- Two people for <i>Twilight.</i>
<i>- Oh, no, no, no, no.</i>

13:55.703 --> 13:58.071
I'm Marcia Langman
from the Society

13:58.139 --> 13:59.773
for family stability foundation.

13:59.841 --> 14:02.142
This book contains
pagan creatures

14:02.210 --> 14:04.411
and strong sexual overtones.

14:04.479 --> 14:07.014
There are girls quivering.

14:07.081 --> 14:09.550
There are boys staring deeply
into girls' eyes

14:09.617 --> 14:11.485
as they quiver and so forth.

14:11.553 --> 14:13.287
There really is a tremendous
amount of quivering.

14:13.354 --> 14:14.988
It is anti-Christian,

14:15.056 --> 14:17.024
it is pro-quivering,
and the government

14:17.091 --> 14:18.926
has no business promoting it.

14:20.929 --> 14:22.429
I totally disagree.

14:22.497 --> 14:23.964
Well, now we have two people
for <i>Twilight.</i>

14:24.032 --> 14:25.599
Absolutely not.

14:25.667 --> 14:27.701
I'm with the National
Civil Liberties Association.

14:27.769 --> 14:31.572
That book actually contains
overt Christian themes,

14:31.639 --> 14:34.074
and as such, has no business
being associated

14:34.142 --> 14:35.742
with any government project.

14:35.810 --> 14:40.480
So too Christian
and not Christian enough?

14:40.548 --> 14:41.815
Do you see the irony here?

14:41.883 --> 14:43.450
No? Okay.

14:43.518 --> 14:46.887
Uh, Donna, why don't you
put a question mark

14:46.955 --> 14:48.021
next <i>Twilight?</i>

14:48.089 --> 14:50.057
No!
You promised!

14:50.124 --> 14:51.892
You promised?
That's not fair!

14:51.960 --> 14:53.260
Wait, it's not a question
of fairness.

14:53.328 --> 14:55.128
- It's secul...
- Go back to Russia, commie!

14:55.196 --> 14:56.663
Hey, you go back to Russia!

14:56.731 --> 14:58.098
And you go back to wherever
you came from!

14:58.166 --> 14:59.266
Why would I go to Russia?

14:59.334 --> 15:00.701
I have no interest
in traveling to Russia.

15:00.768 --> 15:01.935
Can I just say that?

15:03.356 --> 15:04.680
Um, who else?

15:04.800 --> 15:06.167
I would like to include
my favorite book:

15:06.235 --> 15:08.436
<i>Crazy from the Heat:</i>
<i>The David Lee Roth Story.</i>

15:09.313 --> 15:10.813
Well, I think if we're
gonna be adding a book

15:10.881 --> 15:12.748
to the time capsule,
it would probably be <i>Twilight.</i>

15:12.816 --> 15:14.217
I don't care about <i>Twilight.</i>

15:14.284 --> 15:15.918
Why is this only about
his favorite book?

15:15.986 --> 15:17.620
I want my favorite book in there.

15:17.688 --> 15:19.455
Okay, I have an idea.

15:19.523 --> 15:21.691
Two time capsules.

15:21.758 --> 15:24.827
One that totally encapsulates
what's happening

15:24.895 --> 15:26.596
right now in Pawnee
in this moment in time

15:26.663 --> 15:28.064
and the other one
that's just for items

15:28.131 --> 15:30.700
of personal significance,
like <i>Twilight.</i>

15:30.767 --> 15:32.535
No <i>Twilight!</i>

15:32.603 --> 15:34.203
Yes, <i>Twilight!</i>

15:35.772 --> 15:38.140
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:38.208 --> 15:39.542
Thanks for coming.

15:39.610 --> 15:42.011
I only have a second.
I have to get to work.

15:42.079 --> 15:44.513
Bella's going on her first hunt.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.251
I just don't get
why you broke up with me.

15:48.318 --> 15:49.652
Is it 'cause I'm not cool enough

15:49.720 --> 15:51.887
like the normal kids compared
to the vampires?

15:51.955 --> 15:54.890
Is it an Edward-Bella-Jacob
type situation

15:54.958 --> 15:57.893
where you like me but there's
someone else you like more?

15:57.961 --> 16:02.231
Uh, it's nothing
to do with <i>Twilight.</i>

16:02.299 --> 16:05.468
It just didn't work out.
Okay?

16:05.535 --> 16:06.969
Well, what difference
does it make?

16:07.037 --> 16:08.804
If we stayed together,
you probably would have

16:08.872 --> 16:09.805
just dumped me for Ron.

16:09.873 --> 16:12.441
Actually, that's the reason.

16:12.509 --> 16:14.710
I believe you when you say
that you're not in love

16:14.778 --> 16:17.013
with Wendy anymore,
but you're definitely not cool

16:17.080 --> 16:18.147
with her dating Ron.

16:18.215 --> 16:19.482
You talk about it constantly.

16:19.549 --> 16:21.450
Well, I can't help it, okay?

16:21.518 --> 16:23.919
I mean, he's so manly,
and he's my boss.

16:23.987 --> 16:26.522
Imagine if your boss
was Angelina Jolie,

16:26.590 --> 16:28.257
and then one day,
she just started

16:28.325 --> 16:29.525
dating your ex-boyfriend.

16:29.593 --> 16:30.860
Wouldn't that freak you out
a little bit?

16:30.927 --> 16:33.496
Well, not if I had great
new boyfriend, dumbass.

16:33.563 --> 16:35.498
Look, Tom, I like you.

16:35.565 --> 16:38.067
You're really cute
and you're funny

16:38.135 --> 16:40.603
and you're small enough
for me to throw you around.

16:40.671 --> 16:42.938
So if you ever work through this,

16:43.006 --> 16:44.940
then give me a call.

16:50.981 --> 16:53.215
My grandmother lived
in Pawnee for 60 years,

16:53.283 --> 16:56.419
and I want to put her ashes
in the time capsule.

16:56.486 --> 17:00.289
My cat, Turnip,
was the greatest cat ever,

17:00.357 --> 17:03.025
and I'd like to put his ashes
in the time capsule.

17:03.093 --> 17:06.127
For the last time,
and I won't say this again,

17:06.195 --> 17:09.464
there will be no human
or feline ashes

17:09.532 --> 17:11.200
in either one of
the time capsules.

17:11.268 --> 17:13.336
Except for Turnip.

17:13.403 --> 17:15.371
Except for Turnip.

17:15.439 --> 17:16.672
No chanting.

17:16.740 --> 17:18.007
Look, we don't know
what the world

17:18.075 --> 17:19.608
is going to be like in 50 years.

17:19.675 --> 17:23.546
We could all have been wiped out
from disease or the flu.

17:23.613 --> 17:25.513
So what's your suggestion?

17:25.582 --> 17:27.583
I don't know.

17:27.651 --> 17:29.251
I'm just scared.

17:29.319 --> 17:30.686
Hey.

17:32.000 --> 17:38.074

17:45.936 --> 17:47.103
Andy!

17:47.170 --> 17:49.205
I got two microphones,
a four-track recorder,

17:49.272 --> 17:51.741
and every bass tab
to Dave Matthews ever.

17:51.808 --> 17:52.942
- <i>Vamos!</i>
<i>- We're gonna jam</i>

17:53.009 --> 17:54.410
for, like, nine hours.
Is that cool?

17:54.478 --> 17:55.478
- Yeah.
- All right.

17:55.545 --> 17:57.646
That's ridiculous.

17:57.714 --> 17:59.482
Now, why should
the bill of rights

17:59.549 --> 18:02.151
be in the official time capsule

18:02.219 --> 18:04.487
but this painting of my dog

18:04.554 --> 18:07.056
is in time capsule seven?

18:07.124 --> 18:10.092
Well, I think pet paintings/ashes

18:10.160 --> 18:11.961
are in time capsule four.

18:12.028 --> 18:14.764
No, that's baseball cards.

18:14.831 --> 18:16.532
No, baseball cards

18:16.600 --> 18:19.268
are in time capsule nine:
Childhood memorabilia.

18:19.336 --> 18:20.503
Honestly,
<i>Twilight</i> could go

18:20.570 --> 18:22.104
in almost any of these
categories.

18:22.172 --> 18:23.873
Oh, shut up, Kelly!

18:23.940 --> 18:25.341
Make me, Bob!

18:25.409 --> 18:27.843
Okay, let's take
a ten-minute break!

18:27.911 --> 18:29.545
Oh, God.

18:29.613 --> 18:32.615
This time capsule's
tearing this town apart.

18:32.682 --> 18:33.749
You're leaving soon.

18:33.817 --> 18:35.251
Can I blame it on you
in the press?

18:35.318 --> 18:37.953
Sure.

18:38.021 --> 18:39.822
Well, I got to say,
I think it's kind of impressive.

18:39.890 --> 18:41.123
I've been to a lot of towns.

18:41.191 --> 18:42.858
Usually people don't care
about anything.

18:42.926 --> 18:44.393
I mean, don't get me wrong.

18:44.461 --> 18:46.195
These people are weirdos,

18:46.263 --> 18:50.032
but they're weirdos who care.

18:52.102 --> 18:53.769
Excuse me, everyone.

18:53.837 --> 18:56.872
I realize things have gotten
a little out of control,

18:56.940 --> 18:58.874
and that's Ben's fault,
and he's sorry.

18:58.942 --> 19:00.709
But I have an idea,
and if you like it,

19:00.777 --> 19:03.646
I think we can end this
right now.

19:03.713 --> 19:05.448
"Dear Pawnee of the future,

19:05.515 --> 19:07.283
"congratulations.

19:07.350 --> 19:09.185
"You have found a time capsule

19:09.252 --> 19:11.220
"that was buried
over 50 years ago.

19:11.288 --> 19:14.123
"We wanted to include
a collection of items

19:14.191 --> 19:15.357
"that would best represent

19:15.425 --> 19:18.027
"what life was like in our town
at that moment.

19:18.094 --> 19:20.830
"Instead, you'll find
only one item...

19:20.897 --> 19:24.533
"a video recording
of a public forum we held

19:24.601 --> 19:27.770
"in order to determine
just what those items would be.

19:27.838 --> 19:29.939
"This is truly
what life was like...

19:30.006 --> 19:32.875
"a lot of people
with a lot of opinions

19:32.943 --> 19:34.944
"arguing passionately
for what they believed in.

19:35.011 --> 19:38.047
"So enjoy watching it.

19:38.114 --> 19:40.783
"A-assuming you still have
electricity.

19:40.851 --> 19:43.853
"And sorry about the weird
blank gap in the middle.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.354
"A man named Jerry Gergich

19:45.422 --> 19:47.890
"screwed up
the recording somehow.

19:47.958 --> 19:50.092
"He had one job to do.

19:50.160 --> 19:53.596
Sincerely,
Pawnee of the past."

19:59.477 --> 20:00.871
Is Eduardo coming?

20:01.230 --> 20:03.526
No, he went back to Venezuela.

20:03.780 --> 20:05.315
Oh, that sucks.

20:05.829 --> 20:07.237
He was a really good bassist.

20:07.357 --> 20:09.505
- I was actually started to like him.
- I know.

20:10.318 --> 20:11.910
That's what made me start to hate him.

20:15.762 --> 20:19.382
The nice and band totally worked.

20:23.569 --> 20:25.935
Have you enjoyed your time with Andy?

20:26.400 --> 20:28.019
Yeah, he's great.

20:28.139 --> 20:30.315
And he told me how great you are...

20:30.607 --> 20:34.185
And he told me that I would be crazy
to let you away.

20:35.016 --> 20:36.593
- He did, huh?
- He did.

20:36.889 --> 20:40.459
And also, there's a pretzel stand
over there that literally serves

20:40.579 --> 20:42.684
the best pretzel I've ever had.
Would you like one?

20:42.804 --> 20:43.885
Absolutely.

20:45.561 --> 20:46.582
Hey guys.

20:48.244 --> 20:50.786
Listen, I've never seen this before, so...

20:50.906 --> 20:53.469
I'd really appreciated if no one
like talked or texted or anything.

20:54.807 --> 20:55.610
Oh...

21:00.529 --> 21:01.810
Hey.

21:01.930 --> 21:05.162
- Hey, Leslie, thanks for setting this up.
- Dude, what did I just say?

21:05.430 --> 21:08.219
- I was the guy who introduced you to...
- How about you shut up?
