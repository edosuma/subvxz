Mommy, look!
Look over there!

08:20.501 --> 08:22.294
- Kala!
- She's back!

08:27.591 --> 08:29.343
Are you all right,
dear?

08:29.510 --> 08:31.136
I'm fine.
No, really, honestly.

08:31.303 --> 08:34.890
It's just that I got
a little bit... sidetracked.

08:37.058 --> 08:39.852
Well, isn't that, uh...
Well, so...

08:40.020 --> 08:42.940
Well,
it's just so, so...

08:43.106 --> 08:45.400
That's freaky-lookin', okay?
That's what it is.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.402
- Terkina!
- Well, it is!

08:47.528 --> 08:51.198
- I mean, what the heck is it anyway?
- He's a baby.

08:51.365 --> 08:54.785
Ow! I can't...

08:56.245 --> 08:59.540
So, where's his mama?

08:59.706 --> 09:02.918
Well, I'm going to be
his mother now.

09:07.714 --> 09:11.426
You know, he's not so bad
once you get used to him.

09:12.386 --> 09:15.472
Kala's gonna be its mother now.

09:19.601 --> 09:23.522
Kerchak, I saved him from Sabor.

09:26.275 --> 09:29.403
Kala, it won't replace
the one we lost.

09:29.570 --> 09:33.407
I know that.
But... he needs me.

09:33.574 --> 09:38.245
But, it-it-it...
Kala, look at it.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.622
It's not our kind.

09:40.789 --> 09:44.585
No. You have to take it back.

09:44.710 --> 09:47.462
Take him back?
But he'll die!

09:47.629 --> 09:49.756
- If the jungle wants him...
- I want him.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.134
Kala, I cannot let you put
our family in danger.

09:52.301 --> 09:54.970
Does he look dangerous to you?

10:02.561 --> 10:05.898
Hmm. Was it alone?

10:06.064 --> 10:08.400
Yes.
Sabor killed his family.

10:08.567 --> 10:12.571
- Are you sure?
- Yes. There are no others.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.867
Then you may keep him.

10:19.077 --> 10:22.456
- Kerchak, I know he'll be a good son.
- I said he could stay.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.417
That doesn't make him
my son.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.672
We will nest here
for the night.

10:35.928 --> 10:38.597
So, um,
whatcha gonna call it?

10:38.764 --> 10:42.476
I'm gonna call him...
Tarzan.

10:42.643 --> 10:46.188
Tarzan? Okay.
He's your baby.

10:46.355 --> 10:49.483
All right, little lady, come on.
It's way past your nest time.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.527
- Oh, Mom, five more minutes?
- No!

10:51.693 --> 10:53.862
- Two more minutes?
- No!

10:54.029 --> 10:56.698
One more "minutes"?

11:00.702 --> 11:02.454
Oh, no, no, no.

11:02.579 --> 11:06.166
Shh, shh, shh. Don't cry. I'm here.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.836
Come on, come on.

11:09.002 --> 11:13.507
<i>Come, stop your crying
It'll be all right</i>

11:14.550 --> 11:18.804
<i>Just take my hand
Hold it tight</i>

11:19.012 --> 11:23.642
<i>I will protect you
from all around you</i>

11:23.809 --> 11:28.730
<i>I will be here
Don't you cry</i>

11:28.897 --> 11:33.986
<i>For one so small
You seem so strong</i>

11:34.152 --> 11:38.156
<i>My arms will hold you
Keep you safe and warm</i>

11:38.323 --> 11:43.787
<i>This bond between us
can't be broken</i>

11:43.954 --> 11:47.875
<i>I will be here
Don't you cry</i>

11:48.041 --> 11:52.546
<i>'Cause you'll be in my heart</i>

11:52.713 --> 11:56.633
<i>Yes, you'll be in my heart</i>

11:57.759 --> 12:03.473
<i>From this day on
Now and forever more</i>

12:07.603 --> 12:11.857
<i>You'll be in my heart</i>

12:12.024 --> 12:16.695
<i>No matter what they say</i>

12:16.862 --> 12:21.408
<i>You'll be here in my heart</i>

12:21.575 --> 12:24.119
<i>Always</i>

12:27.831 --> 12:30.417
<i>Always</i>

13:01.073 --> 13:05.244
- I sure scared you, Mom. Whoa.
- You sure did!

13:05.410 --> 13:07.704
Can't you imitate
any quieter animals?

13:07.871 --> 13:11.250
Oh, Mom, they're no fun.
Wanna see me be a leopard?

13:13.418 --> 13:16.380
Why don't you just
come up with your own sound?

13:22.719 --> 13:24.429
Kala!

13:28.892 --> 13:31.937
Oops.

13:32.104 --> 13:33.939
Hee-hee.

13:34.106 --> 13:36.441
Tarzan, thank goodness
you're all right!

13:36.608 --> 13:40.320
Kala and I have been
so worried!

13:40.487 --> 13:43.740
Thank you. Thank you so much
for finding him, Kerchak.

13:43.907 --> 13:46.285
You are such a wise
and caring leader.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.495
Run.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.956
Ooh!
Um...

13:53.876 --> 13:56.461
- Hello! Are you thick in the head?
- What?

13:56.545 --> 13:58.297
How many times
do I have to tell ya?

13:58.380 --> 14:02.092
If you want Kerchak to like you,
stay away from him!

14:02.176 --> 14:04.469
- Come on, Terk! Step on it!
- Last one there's a dung beetle!

14:04.636 --> 14:08.265
- Yeah! And the first one's gotta eat it!
- Terk, can I come?

14:08.432 --> 14:12.561
Well, yeah, you could if you could keep
up, but... you can't really keep up.

14:12.728 --> 14:16.732
Wait up, guys.
Wait up! Right behind ya.

14:25.616 --> 14:28.285
Ah, yeah, take that.
Stop hitting yourself.

14:28.452 --> 14:32.247
Stop hitting yourself!
Stop hitting yourself!

14:32.414 --> 14:36.293
<i>The fun has arrived</i>
Thank you very much.

14:36.460 --> 14:37.961
What took you
so long?

14:38.128 --> 14:42.674
I had a little pest control problem,
but it's all taken care of.

14:43.592 --> 14:45.010
Hi, guys.

14:45.177 --> 14:48.263
Terk, what is this?
Some kind of joke?

14:48.430 --> 14:50.807
Tell me I'm not lookin'
at the hairless wonder.

14:50.974 --> 14:53.769
Terk said I could come along
if I could keep up.

14:55.312 --> 14:57.523
- Ah, no, Terk, come on!
- Terk!

14:57.606 --> 15:00.108
I'll handle this, guys.
Okay?

15:00.275 --> 15:01.818
Listen, buddy, come here.

15:02.027 --> 15:04.655
We got a tiny,
little, itsy-bitsy problem here.

15:04.738 --> 15:07.574
Personally, I'd love to hang out
with you. You know I would.

15:07.741 --> 15:10.828
But the guys, they need
a little convincing, you know.

15:10.994 --> 15:12.538
Okay.
What do I gotta do?

15:12.704 --> 15:16.834
Do? What do you gotta do?
It's so stupid!

15:17.000 --> 15:22.798
- What?
- Well, you gotta... You gotta go get a hair.

15:22.881 --> 15:23.632
A hair?

15:23.882 --> 15:27.469
Yeah, a hair.

15:27.636 --> 15:29.888
An elephant hair.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.520
An elephant hair?

15:36.603 --> 15:39.106
Like I said,
it's stupid, right?

15:39.189 --> 15:41.733
Listen, take it from me.
Go home, okay?

15:41.900 --> 15:46.530
Who needs this aggravation? You know?
I'm probably gonna leave soon myself.

15:46.697 --> 15:49.533
You go, I'll catch up.
All right?

15:49.700 --> 15:53.537
You see? Leave it to me.
I told ya... Tarzan!

15:53.704 --> 15:55.998
Tarzan, no!

16:03.547 --> 16:06.592
That one hurt him.

16:23.734 --> 16:25.068
Look!

16:25.235 --> 16:29.239
- Oh, oh, there he is! He's alive!
- Hey, guys!

16:29.406 --> 16:31.033
Hi!

16:31.200 --> 16:34.453
Oh, no. No, no, no!

16:34.536 --> 16:37.831
Come back!
Come back!

16:37.915 --> 16:41.627
This guy's great! If he lives,
you should bring him around more often.

16:41.793 --> 16:45.088
- Come on, let's go get a better seat.
- Ohh.

16:46.548 --> 16:50.469
- You never get enough sleep.
- I get enough sleep.

16:50.636 --> 16:55.265
Mom, are you sure
this water's sanitary?

16:55.474 --> 16:58.393
It looks questionable to me.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.521
It's fine, honey.

17:00.687 --> 17:05.108
Yech!
But what about bacteria?

17:05.192 --> 17:08.612
Tantor, can't you see
Mommy's talking?

17:12.866 --> 17:17.496
Watch out! There's something
swimming! It's coming right at you!

17:17.579 --> 17:19.498
Honey, Mommy's losing
her patience.

17:19.665 --> 17:23.502
- But this time I really see something!
- Oh, boy.

17:23.585 --> 17:26.128
Piranha! It's a piranha!

17:26.296 --> 17:29.925
Sweetheart, there are
no piranhas in Africa.

17:30.008 --> 17:33.512
Don't tell the kid that. Of course
there are piranhas in Africa.

17:33.595 --> 17:36.014
No, she's right.
They're native to South America.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.683
Get outta here.

17:37.766 --> 17:41.353
No way! Come on. Do you think
I'd be standing here if...

17:41.436 --> 17:43.730
Aah! It's right behind you!
Run!

17:43.897 --> 17:48.402
For the last time, honey, there
are no piranhas in...

17:48.485 --> 17:49.945
My butt!

17:50.487 --> 17:53.365
- I told you!
- There's something on my butt.

17:53.448 --> 17:55.242
- What is it?
- Are there any more of them?

17:56.034 --> 18:00.914
- What is it?
- It's a piranha!

18:01.498 --> 18:03.208
Huh?

18:04.459 --> 18:06.712
Piranha!

18:09.131 --> 18:11.091
Tantor, where are...

18:22.019 --> 18:24.021
He's dead!

18:24.146 --> 18:26.023
We're dead!

18:32.487 --> 18:34.865
We didn't do it!
They're the ones!

18:52.758 --> 18:55.093
Oh, thank you, Kerchak.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.391
Tarzan, buddy! Buddy, come on.
Tarzan, don't die on me.

19:01.558 --> 19:04.186
Don't die on me.
You weren't supposed to do it!

19:04.269 --> 19:08.190
Get away from there! Don't you know a
piranha can strip your flesh in seconds?

19:08.273 --> 19:11.318
What? He's not a piranha!
He's...

19:12.319 --> 19:13.570
He's alive!

19:13.737 --> 19:16.782
- He's alive! He's alive!
- He's alive!

19:16.949 --> 19:19.618
He's alive...
You idiot!

19:19.785 --> 19:23.455
You nearly gave me a heart
attack. Ya happy?

19:23.580 --> 19:27.251
You... I don't believe it.
You got the hair?

19:27.417 --> 19:32.005
Is that what this is all about?
I got a whole tail of them.

19:32.965 --> 19:34.007
- Tarzan!
- Terkina!

19:34.424 --> 19:35.592
Oh, no!

19:36.385 --> 19:38.428
- Who's that?
- My mom.

19:38.595 --> 19:41.557
- Tarzan!
- Hi, Aunt Kala.

19:41.723 --> 19:44.643
- Oh, you scared me! What happened?
- Well, I...

19:44.726 --> 19:48.605
It's sort of a long...
It's involved because what happened...

19:48.689 --> 19:50.774
- It was a weird...
- What happened?

19:53.402 --> 19:56.572
- It was my fault, Kerchak.
- Tarzan!

19:56.738 --> 20:01.410
We were playing and well...
I'm... I'm sorry, Kerchak.

20:01.577 --> 20:03.579
You almost killed someone!

20:03.745 --> 20:05.789
- But it was an accident.
- He's only a child.

20:05.956 --> 20:08.417
That's no excuse, Kala!
You can't keep defending him!

20:08.500 --> 20:09.960
- But he'll learn!
- He will never learn!

20:10.127 --> 20:13.213
- You can't learn to be one of us.
- Because you never give him a chance!

20:13.297 --> 20:18.594
Give him a chance? Kala, look at him.
He will never be one of us.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.846
Kerchak!

20:21.013 --> 20:23.265
Tarzan!

21:13.524 --> 21:15.817
Tarzan,
what are you doing?

21:16.485 --> 21:18.487
Why am I so different?

21:18.654 --> 21:20.697
Because you're covered
with mud. That's why.

21:20.864 --> 21:24.660
- No! Kerchak said I didn't
belong in the... - Close your mouth.

21:24.743 --> 21:26.245
Said I don't belong
in the family.

21:26.411 --> 21:29.748
Never mind what Kerchak said.
Now, hold still!

21:29.915 --> 21:31.750
But, look at me!

21:34.336 --> 21:38.257
I am, Tarzan.
And do you know what I see?

21:38.423 --> 21:41.426
I see two eyes,
like mine.

21:41.593 --> 21:44.930
And a nose...
somewhere.

21:45.097 --> 21:47.766
Ahh... here!

21:47.891 --> 21:50.394
Two ears!

21:51.103 --> 21:53.772
- And, let's see. What else?
- Two hands?

21:53.939 --> 21:55.774
That's right.

22:12.082 --> 22:14.376
Close your eyes.

22:14.543 --> 22:18.755
Now forget what you see.
What do you feel?

22:20.465 --> 22:21.550
My heart.

22:22.134 --> 22:23.218
Come here.

22:24.970 --> 22:27.306
- Your heart.
- See?

22:27.472 --> 22:31.351
We're exactly the same.

22:31.518 --> 22:35.189
Oh!
Kerchak just can't see that.

22:37.733 --> 22:39.234
I'll make him see it!

22:39.484 --> 22:41.653
I'll be the best ape ever!

22:41.820 --> 22:45.282
Oh, I bet you will.

22:57.920 --> 23:01.548
<i>Oh, the power to be strong</i>

23:01.715 --> 23:05.427
<i>And the wisdom
to be wise</i>

23:05.594 --> 23:10.182
<i>All these things
will come to you in time</i>

23:11.475 --> 23:14.728
<i>On this journey
that you're making</i>

23:14.895 --> 23:18.190
<i>There'll be answers
that you'll seek</i>

23:18.482 --> 23:21.401
<i>And it's you who'll climb
the mountain</i>

23:21.693 --> 23:25.155
<i>It's you who'll reach
the peak</i>

23:26.073 --> 23:29.117
<i>Son of man
look to the sky</i>

23:29.284 --> 23:32.371
<i>Lift your spirit
Set it free</i>

23:32.538 --> 23:35.833
<i>Some day you'll walk tall
with pride</i>

23:35.999 --> 23:41.171
<i>Son of man
A man in time you'll be</i>

23:51.932 --> 23:55.310
<i>Though there's no one there
to guide you</i>

23:55.477 --> 23:59.606
<i>No one to take your hand</i>

23:59.773 --> 24:02.359
<i>But with faith
and understanding</i>

24:02.526 --> 24:06.530
<i>You will journey
from boy to man</i>

24:06.697 --> 24:09.116
<i>Son of man
look to the sky</i>

24:09.283 --> 24:13.078
<i>Lift your spirit
Set it free</i>

24:13.245 --> 24:16.248
<i>Some day you'll walk tall
with pride</i>

24:16.415 --> 24:22.129
<i>Son of man
A man in time you'll be</i>

24:27.134 --> 24:29.136
<i>In learning
you will teach</i>

24:29.303 --> 24:33.182
<i>And in teaching
you will learn</i>

24:33.348 --> 24:37.895
<i>You'll find your place
beside the ones you love</i>

24:39.354 --> 24:43.567
<i>All and all
the things you've dreamed of</i>

24:43.734 --> 24:46.653
<i>The visions that you saw</i>

24:46.820 --> 24:50.073
<i>Well, the time
is drawing near now</i>

24:50.240 --> 24:53.702
<i>It's yours to claim it all</i>

24:53.869 --> 24:57.372
<i>Son of man
look to the sky</i>

24:57.539 --> 25:00.751
<i>Lift your spirit
Set it free</i>

25:00.918 --> 25:03.962
<i>Some day you'll walk tall
with pride</i>

25:04.129 --> 25:09.301
<i>Son of man
A man in time you'll be</i>

25:16.308 --> 25:22.606
<i>Son of man
Son of man's a man for all to see</i>

25:40.624 --> 25:42.876
Don't even think
about it.

25:44.336 --> 25:47.422
- How'd you know it was me?
- I'm your mother. I know everything.

25:47.506 --> 25:50.551
- Where have you been?
- I thought you knew everything.

25:53.011 --> 25:55.848
Hey, Auntie "K."
You're looking remarkably groomed today.

25:55.931 --> 25:57.015
Hello, Terk.

25:57.182 --> 26:00.227
Not the neck.
Not the neck there, "T."

26:06.567 --> 26:10.153
Whoa! Okay. It's all fun and games
till someone loses an eye.

26:10.320 --> 26:13.198
Please stop.
Somebody's gonna get hurt.

26:13.282 --> 26:15.701
- And it's always me. Please.
- Cramp in the calf!

26:15.868 --> 26:20.080
Okay, you win! Ow, ow!
Okay! You win. Hello?

26:20.372 --> 26:22.207
Yo, yo, let go!

26:22.749 --> 26:25.252
- Oh, sorry, Terk.
- What kind of animal are you?

26:25.419 --> 26:26.712
I've been thinking lately that.

26:26.795 --> 26:29.673
Maybe Tarzan could be
some subspecies of elephant.

26:29.923 --> 26:31.884
What, are you crazy?
An elephant?

26:32.134 --> 26:34.845
Listen to me.
Think about it. He enjoys a peanut.

26:35.012 --> 26:38.098
- I enjoy a peanut.
- He looks nothing like you!

29:26.058 --> 29:28.185
Okay, everybody, move aside.
Outta my way!

29:28.352 --> 29:31.188
Best friend comin' through.
That would be me.

29:31.355 --> 29:33.690
And you, don't make
a habit of that, okay?

29:33.857 --> 29:36.109
There are other ways
of gettin' attention. You know?

29:36.276 --> 29:38.654
- I'll try to remember that.
- All right.

29:38.820 --> 29:40.739
I was right behind ya
if you needed me.

30:19.069 --> 30:20.320
What was that?

30:20.487 --> 30:23.157
Ayah, it wasn't me.
I swear!

30:23.282 --> 30:25.909
- Okay, maybe it was.
- Everyone!

30:26.118 --> 30:27.953
Let's move.

31:16.710 --> 31:19.338
This reminds me
of the safari I led up the Zambezi.

31:22.466 --> 31:23.509
...Back, back,
back, back, back.

31:23.675 --> 31:26.011
Ooh, was it scary there.

31:26.178 --> 31:31.266
Two men with only three rifles.
We blasted away.

31:31.433 --> 31:34.478
That's when I knew
I was born for Africa!

31:34.645 --> 31:38.482
And Africa
was created for...

31:45.989 --> 31:47.115
Clayton!

31:48.325 --> 31:49.701
Clayton!
Oh, there you are.

31:49.785 --> 31:52.830
What is it? What is it, Clayton?
Are we in danger?

31:52.913 --> 31:54.957
I thought I saw something.

31:55.123 --> 31:58.168
Is it a Hippopotamus Amphibious,
or a Rhinoceros Bihornus?

31:58.252 --> 32:00.838
- Professor, don't move!
- Ah, right.

32:01.004 --> 32:01.797
Daddy?

32:04.466 --> 32:07.594
Daddy, what's all
the hullabaloo about? Aah!

32:11.181 --> 32:11.974
What is it, Daddy?

32:12.140 --> 32:15.269
Mr Clayton asked me not to move.
He saw something.

32:17.437 --> 32:19.857
Oh, I moved.

32:20.023 --> 32:23.068
Ah, Mr Clayton, sorry.
Excuse me, uh...

32:23.235 --> 32:26.405
But my father and I came on
this expedition to study gorillas.

32:26.947 --> 32:29.783
I believe your shooting
might be scaring them off.

32:29.867 --> 32:34.079
You hired me to protect you,
Miss Porter, and protect you I shall.

32:34.246 --> 32:36.540
And you're doing
a marvellous job of it.

32:36.707 --> 32:40.127
We only have a short time before
the ship returns...

32:40.294 --> 32:44.214
Jane! Jane, do you realize
what you're standing in?

32:44.381 --> 32:46.258
- A gorilla's nest!
- Oh, Daddy!

32:46.425 --> 32:50.137
At last,
our first sign in days!

32:50.304 --> 32:52.723
Do you think the beasts
could be nearby?

32:52.806 --> 32:53.473
Could be.

32:53.557 --> 32:58.312
There's the evidence.
Not very far, anyway.

32:58.395 --> 32:59.354
Daddy, look!
Over there and there!

32:59.438 --> 33:01.440
Where? Oh, yes,
more nests! I see them!

33:01.607 --> 33:04.651
- Just as you predicted.
- Whole family groups!

33:04.735 --> 33:06.904
Jane, I love you!

33:08.489 --> 33:12.868
Family groups? Excuse me,
but these are wild beasts...

33:13.035 --> 33:15.078
that would sooner tear your head off
than look at you.

33:15.245 --> 33:20.000
On the contrary. Daddy's theory
is that these are social creatures...

33:25.589 --> 33:28.634
Mr. Clayton, please.
What if it's a gorilla?

33:28.926 --> 33:31.637
It's no gorilla.

33:34.640 --> 33:37.351
- But we should press on.
- Yes, indeed.

33:37.518 --> 33:41.104
We should keep heading west
following the Ganoderma Ablonatum.

33:41.271 --> 33:45.108
Excellent, Professor! I could've used
your expertise on my last safari.

33:53.325 --> 33:55.994
Are you what all the fuss
was about?

33:56.662 --> 33:59.122
Daddy!
Daddy, quick!

33:59.748 --> 34:01.291
No, wait, wait.
Hold still.

34:01.458 --> 34:03.377
Oh, my.
Oh, my good...

34:03.544 --> 34:05.671
You may not be a gorilla,

34:05.838 --> 34:07.923
but you are one sweet little...

34:11.051 --> 34:13.971
Huh. There you go.
What do you think?

34:18.100 --> 34:19.434
What? Oh!

34:20.268 --> 34:21.937
Why, you little...

34:22.103 --> 34:25.065
Well, this is
absolutely peachy!

34:25.232 --> 34:29.527
Come to study gorillas, and get
my sketchbook pinched by a baboon!

34:37.202 --> 34:38.495
Give me that!

34:40.496 --> 34:44.251
Come on now, enough of this.
I want this paper on the count of three.

34:44.418 --> 34:47.545
One, two...

34:47.713 --> 34:49.797
Oh, look, bananas!

34:52.426 --> 34:54.887
I can't believe you fell for that one!

34:55.512 --> 34:58.724
No, no, don't give me those crocodile tears.

34:58.891 --> 35:01.393
What would your parents have to say?

35:03.687 --> 35:06.982
Oh! See, I told you
they'd be cross.

35:07.149 --> 35:10.277
Go easy on him.
Children will be children.

35:28.879 --> 35:32.925
Oh! I'm flying!
What on earth am I...

35:36.762 --> 35:38.639
Get off! Get off!

35:43.227 --> 35:45.938
Oh! Put me down!
Put me down!

35:46.897 --> 35:48.815
No! Pick me up, pick me up!

36:17.219 --> 36:19.429
Unhand me!

36:38.657 --> 36:39.741
Ah, over there!

37:29.750 --> 37:33.086
I'm in a tree with a man
who talks to monkeys.

37:33.253 --> 37:35.797
Ooh, I can't do this!
I can't... Oh!

37:35.964 --> 37:38.634
This is good.
This is... very good.

37:39.760 --> 37:42.971
Wait. One, two...

37:46.225 --> 37:49.478
It can't get any worse, can it?

37:51.522 --> 37:53.899
Obviously, it can.

37:56.527 --> 38:02.157
Ahh... no! Oh!

38:02.324 --> 38:06.286
Stay back. No, don't.
Don't come any closer. Please, don't.

38:06.453 --> 38:08.956
What are... What are you doing?

38:09.122 --> 38:12.376
Please don't.
That tickles.

38:12.543 --> 38:14.127
No, get off, get off...
Get off!

38:15.420 --> 38:16.380
It serves you right.

38:16.463 --> 38:21.093
Stay away from me like
a very good wild man. You, stay.

38:21.218 --> 38:23.762
I'm warning you.
My father won't take kindly to you...

38:23.929 --> 38:27.099
No. That's...
Now, that's close enough.

38:27.975 --> 38:30.936
How dare you? Wha...

39:16.273 --> 39:20.527
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear!

39:20.694 --> 39:25.532
Yes, thank you. It's a lovely heartbeat.
It's very nice.

39:27.284 --> 39:29.161
It's very nice.

39:29.328 --> 39:32.664
Oh, thank you. I can't do a thing
with it in this humidity though. It's...

39:32.789 --> 39:35.000
You...
You do speak.

39:35.167 --> 39:38.712
And all this time I thought you were just
a big, wild, quiet, silent person-thing.

39:38.879 --> 39:42.925
Why didn't you tell me? I must say I'm
rather curious as to who you are. I'd love...

39:44.259 --> 39:46.929
Tarzan.

39:51.266 --> 39:53.060
Tarzan.

39:54.353 --> 39:55.812
Tarzan.

39:59.566 --> 40:00.859
Oh, I see!

40:01.026 --> 40:03.028
Oh, I see!

40:03.195 --> 40:04.947
Tarzan.

40:05.113 --> 40:06.990
Oh, I see.

40:07.241 --> 40:09.576
No, no, no.
No.

40:10.953 --> 40:12.037
I'm Jane.

40:12.996 --> 40:16.708
No, no, no. No.
I'm Jane.

40:17.626 --> 40:22.339
No, no.
Jane. Tarzan.

40:22.506 --> 40:24.842
Jane.

40:25.008 --> 40:28.178
- Jane.
- Exactly.

40:29.680 --> 40:30.597
Clayton!

40:34.518 --> 40:35.686
Clayton!

40:35.853 --> 40:37.688
Extraordinary!

40:37.855 --> 40:42.693
Um, please,
can you take me to my camp?

40:43.861 --> 40:46.238
Yes! Clayton!
Wonderful!

40:46.697 --> 40:51.326
Um, could we...
Um, can't we walk?

40:51.535 --> 40:54.329
Can't we walk?

40:55.080 --> 40:58.292
- Tarzan!
- Tarzan, where are ya?

40:58.458 --> 41:01.336
- Tarzan!
- Let's hope we find him before Kerchak does.

41:01.503 --> 41:03.589
- Maybe he's lost.
- Or found something more interesting.

41:03.755 --> 41:06.258
What, are you nuts? What could be
more interesting than us?

41:08.427 --> 41:10.470
Hey! What's everybody lookin' at?

41:16.852 --> 41:20.689
The horror!
It's gruesome! Hide me!

41:20.772 --> 41:23.233
Pull yourself together.
You're embarrassing me.

41:23.901 --> 41:27.821
- These things aren't alive.
- I knew that.

41:27.988 --> 41:31.325
- Tarzan?
- Tarzan? - Tarzan?

41:31.450 --> 41:33.285
Hello?

41:34.244 --> 41:38.665
What kind of primitive beasts
are responsible for this mess?

41:46.215 --> 41:49.510
Wow! Come here, you guys! Come here,
come here, come here. Look at this!

41:49.676 --> 41:51.929
- What is that? Funny. Wow, it's...
- What is that thing?

41:58.810 --> 42:01.647
Hey, do it again.
Do it again.

42:02.773 --> 42:03.857
Like this?

42:05.484 --> 42:06.527
Yeah!

42:08.278 --> 42:10.113
Yeah, rip it!

42:12.491 --> 42:13.492
I love that part!

42:15.035 --> 42:17.454
Let me hear it, big fella.

42:17.955 --> 42:19.164
Now, hit it!

42:22.417 --> 42:23.210
Yeah!

42:26.505 --> 42:27.548
Nice!

42:29.424 --> 42:31.134
What the heck?
Bye-bye.

42:31.218 --> 42:32.052
Terk!

42:33.470 --> 42:35.097
- Yeah, Tant?
- Hmm?

42:35.264 --> 42:38.684
Now! Hit it!
Come on, Tantor!

42:39.852 --> 42:42.521
Oh, I love it!

42:42.688 --> 42:46.441
Stay with me, fellas.
I feel somethin' happenin' here.

43:20.267 --> 43:21.059
Yeah!

44:14.279 --> 44:15.614
Gorillas!

44:23.705 --> 44:25.415
He's one of them!

44:48.063 --> 44:49.481
Oh, my...

45:24.433 --> 45:27.561
- Jane!Jane!
- Jane!

45:29.479 --> 45:32.399
Jane, where are you?

45:32.566 --> 45:35.819
Jane! Oh, Jane!
Oh, thank goodness.

45:35.903 --> 45:37.446
Good heavens,
what happened?

45:37.529 --> 45:39.907
Are you all right? We've been
everywhere looking for you. I...

45:40.073 --> 45:43.452
Oh, my goodness! Daddy!
I was out walking.

45:43.702 --> 45:45.245
- I was...
- Yes, yes.

45:45.329 --> 45:47.122
Little baby monkey.

45:47.206 --> 45:48.290
- I drew a picture.
- Yes, go on.

45:48.457 --> 45:50.501
- Suddenly the monkey starts crying.
- Oh, poor thing.

45:50.667 --> 45:53.795
- I turned 'round and there's a
whole fleet of them! - Of what?

45:53.879 --> 45:57.007
- There's an army of monkeys. A huge tree
full of them. - Monkeys? Monkeys!

45:57.549 --> 45:59.468
Screaming at me!

45:59.635 --> 46:01.720
- That's Theripithicus Baboonus.
She's very good at this. - Oh, really?

46:01.887 --> 46:04.556
Terrified I was. And suddenly, I was swinging

46:04.640 --> 46:07.351
- in the vines.
- With the monkeys, yes?

46:07.434 --> 46:09.436
- Swinging, flying. I was in the air.
- In the air, yes, I know.

46:09.603 --> 46:11.230
- And I'm all surrounded.
- What did you do?

46:11.313 --> 46:13.565
Daddy, they took my boot.

46:13.649 --> 46:15.651
They took... Those are
the ones I bought you.

46:15.734 --> 46:20.739
And I was saved! I was saved
by a flying wild man in a loin cloth.

46:20.823 --> 46:23.075
- Loin cloth? Good Lord.
- What is she talking about?

46:23.242 --> 46:26.537
I haven't the foggiest idea.
Takes after her mother, you know.

46:26.703 --> 46:29.706
She'd come up with stories like that.
Not about men in loin cloths, of course.

46:29.873 --> 46:31.959
- And there were gorillas.
- Gorillas?

46:32.125 --> 46:33.585
- They were doing...
- You saw the gorillas?

46:33.669 --> 46:35.462
Where, Jane, where?

46:36.380 --> 46:37.589
He left with them.

46:37.673 --> 46:39.049
Who, dear, who?

46:40.008 --> 46:41.510
Tarzan.

46:41.677 --> 46:45.639
- Tarzan?
- The ape man.

46:48.892 --> 46:51.603
Everyone, we will avoid
the strangers.

46:51.770 --> 46:54.314
Do not let them see you,
and do not seek them out.

46:54.398 --> 46:55.607
They mean us no harm, Kerchak.

46:55.691 --> 46:58.652
- Tarzan, I don't know that.
- But I do. I've spent time with them.

46:58.819 --> 47:01.321
You may be willing to risk
our safety, but I'm not.

47:01.488 --> 47:04.158
Why are you threatened
by anyone different from you?

47:07.119 --> 47:11.456
Protect this family,
and stay away from them.

47:15.043 --> 47:17.254
Tarzan, for once
listen to Kerchak.

47:17.421 --> 47:21.133
Why didn't you tell me there were
creatures that looked like me?

47:29.016 --> 47:33.395
Well, he didn't stand upright,
he sort of crouched, like that.

47:33.478 --> 47:35.647
- Really?
- Supported his weight on his knuckles.

47:35.814 --> 47:37.441
- See?
- On the knuckles!

47:37.608 --> 47:40.319
- Exactly like a gorilla!
- Extraordinary!

47:40.611 --> 47:42.112
It was amazing!

47:42.196 --> 47:45.574
And he bends his elbows out like this,
and then he walks like this.

47:45.657 --> 47:48.285
Oh, I see!
Like Aunt Isabel!

47:50.579 --> 47:51.872
This is capital!

47:51.955 --> 47:54.458
Oh, Janey, Jane!
What a discovery!

47:54.625 --> 47:56.627
A man with no language,
no human behaviour.

47:56.793 --> 47:59.129
And no respect
for personal boundaries.

47:59.296 --> 48:02.883
- How do you mean?
- He was this close, Daddy! Staring at me.

48:03.300 --> 48:06.220
He seemed confused
at first,

48:06.386 --> 48:09.515
as if he's never seen
another human before.

48:09.681 --> 48:11.975
His eyes were intense,

48:12.142 --> 48:14.853
and focused and...

48:15.020 --> 48:19.149
I've never seen such eyes.

48:20.859 --> 48:21.902
Oh, shall I, ahem,

48:22.069 --> 48:25.823
leave you and the blackboard
alone for a moment?

48:25.989 --> 48:29.827
Daddy, stop it. The point is,
think of what we could learn from him.

48:29.993 --> 48:32.412
We must find him.

48:32.913 --> 48:36.542
Professor, you are here
to find gorillas,

48:36.625 --> 48:39.211
not indulge
some girlish fantasy.

48:39.336 --> 48:43.006
Fantasy? I didn't imagine him!
Tarzan is...

48:44.633 --> 48:45.634
Real.

48:45.884 --> 48:50.097
Ah! It's him!
It's, it's, it's him. Tarzan!

48:50.264 --> 48:52.099
- Professor! Jane! Stand back!
- Wait!

48:52.266 --> 48:54.184
No!

48:54.351 --> 48:56.186
Clayton.

48:58.355 --> 49:00.190
- Clayton.
- Ahh!

49:00.357 --> 49:02.568
Have we... met?

49:03.819 --> 49:05.571
How does he
know my name?

49:06.238 --> 49:08.282
He thinks it means
the sound of a gunshot.

49:08.448 --> 49:12.202
- Jane.
- Yes, hello, mmm, Tarzan.

49:12.369 --> 49:14.538
I see what you mean
about those personal boundaries.

49:14.705 --> 49:18.041
What's he doing?

49:18.208 --> 49:20.085
Look at him, Jane...

49:20.711 --> 49:22.546
Moves like an ape
but looks like a man.

49:22.629 --> 49:25.215
He could be
the missing link!

49:25.382 --> 49:28.552
Or our link
to the gorillas.

49:28.635 --> 49:30.888
Ahh, yes, yes.

49:31.930 --> 49:34.141
Where are the gorillas?

49:35.851 --> 49:38.145
Go-ril-las!

49:38.312 --> 49:40.355
Go-ril-las!

49:40.522 --> 49:43.275
Shouting won't help, Mr Clayton.
He doesn't understand English.

49:43.442 --> 49:45.444
Then I'll make him understand.

49:45.611 --> 49:48.864
If I can teach a parrot
to sing "God Save the Queen,"

49:49.198 --> 49:52.534
I can certainly teach this savage
a thing or two.

49:53.619 --> 49:55.454
Go-rilla.

49:56.705 --> 49:59.708
- Go-rilla.
- Oh-ho! He's got it!

49:59.875 --> 50:02.961
Gorilla.
Gorilla!

50:03.128 --> 50:05.214
- Perhaps not.
- No, no, no, no!

50:05.380 --> 50:08.217
- No, no, no, no, no!
- No, no, no. Gimme that.

50:08.383 --> 50:09.801
No, no.
Leave that. No.

50:09.968 --> 50:13.222
Mr Clayton,
I think I'll take it from here.

50:22.898 --> 50:24.983
<i>Whatever you do</i>

50:25.567 --> 50:26.902
<i>I'll do it too</i>

50:27.361 --> 50:30.322
<i>Show me everything
Tell me how</i>

50:30.948 --> 50:32.616
<i>It all means something</i>

50:33.408 --> 50:35.661
<i>And yet nothing to me</i>

50:38.956 --> 50:42.501
<i>I can see
there's so much to learn</i>

50:42.668 --> 50:46.296
<i>It's all so close
and yet so far</i>

50:46.964 --> 50:50.551
<i>I see myself
as people see me</i>

50:50.926 --> 50:54.805
<i>Oh, I just know there's
something bigger out there</i>

50:54.972 --> 50:58.809
<i>I wanna know
Can you show me</i>

50:58.976 --> 51:02.813
<i>I wanna know about
these strangers like me</i>

51:02.980 --> 51:06.775
<i>Tell me more
Please show me</i>

51:06.942 --> 51:10.863
<i>Something's familiar about
these strangers like me</i>

51:19.163 --> 51:21.540
<i>Every gesture</i>

51:21.707 --> 51:26.879
<i>Every move that she makes
makes me feel like never before</i>

51:27.045 --> 51:29.214
<i>Why do I have</i>

51:29.381 --> 51:33.343
<i>This growing need
to be beside her</i>

51:35.012 --> 51:38.599
<i>Ooo, these emotions
I never knew</i>

51:38.765 --> 51:42.853
<i>Of some other world
far beyond this place</i>

51:43.020 --> 51:46.648
<i>Beyond the trees
above the clouds</i>

51:46.815 --> 51:50.903
<i>I see before me
a new horizon</i>

51:51.069 --> 51:55.032
<i>I wanna know
Can you show me</i>

51:55.199 --> 51:58.994
<i>I wanna know about
these strangers like me</i>

51:59.161 --> 52:02.956
<i>Tell me more
Please show me</i>

52:03.165 --> 52:06.877
<i>Something's familiar about
these strangers like me</i>

52:08.295 --> 52:12.132
<i>Come with me now
to see my world</i>

52:12.299 --> 52:16.303
<i>Where there's beauty
beyond your dreams</i>

52:16.470 --> 52:20.390
<i>Can you feel the things
I feel</i>

52:20.557 --> 52:24.228
<i>Right now with you</i>

52:26.146 --> 52:28.649
<i>Take my hand</i>

52:28.816 --> 52:32.402
<i>There's a world
I need to know</i>

52:50.170 --> 52:52.798
We've wasted
all this time on what he wants.

52:52.923 --> 52:56.927
The boat could arrive any day.
Now ask him straight out.

52:59.847 --> 53:00.889
Tarzan?

53:01.932 --> 53:04.309
Will you take us
to the gorillas?

53:04.601 --> 53:06.228
Do you understand?

53:06.353 --> 53:08.188
I understand.

53:08.355 --> 53:10.232
- Ooh! Good work, Jane.
- Well?

53:10.941 --> 53:12.109
I can't.

53:12.276 --> 53:14.027
- What?
- Why not, Tarzan?

53:14.862 --> 53:16.113
Kerchak.

53:19.241 --> 53:23.203
<i>I wanna know
Can you show me</i>

53:23.370 --> 53:27.082
<i>I wanna know about
these strangers like me</i>

53:27.249 --> 53:31.587
<i>Tell me more
Please show me</i>

53:31.753 --> 53:36.091
<i>Something's familiar about
these strangers like me</i>

53:36.258 --> 53:38.260
<i>I wanna know</i>

53:55.777 --> 53:59.990
Oh, Terk, I've never
seen him so happy.

54:00.157 --> 54:01.909
Eh, I give it a week.

54:05.078 --> 54:07.331
Aye, cut her loose!

54:07.623 --> 54:11.168
- Arg, c'mon.
- Allright, move it, you fieldrats.

54:13.337 --> 54:14.630
Put your back into it.

54:14.796 --> 54:17.466
Wait, please. Don't...
I've waited 30 years for this,

54:17.633 --> 54:19.801
and I won't leave
until I see a gorilla.

54:19.968 --> 54:21.929
Oh, isn't this dreadful,
Tarzan?

54:22.095 --> 54:24.306
Whoa!
No, no. Wait.

54:28.936 --> 54:29.978
You're the captain.

54:30.062 --> 54:33.774
Just tell them you've had engine
trouble, and give us two more days.

54:33.941 --> 54:36.318
And be late at every port
from here to London?

54:36.485 --> 54:38.320
We'll have come all this way
for nothing.

54:38.487 --> 54:42.407
I'm sorry, Miss Porter,
but I simply can't do it.

54:42.574 --> 54:44.618
Agh! This is your fault.

54:44.785 --> 54:47.913
I should've followed my instincts,
and set traps for the beasts.

54:48.080 --> 54:50.541
Don't you think I'm disappointed
about the gorillas?

54:50.707 --> 54:53.585
- You are absolutely impos...
- Oh!

54:53.752 --> 54:57.256
Tarzan! I was so afraid
you wouldn't come in time.

54:57.422 --> 54:59.800
The boat's arrived.
The boat that's come...

54:59.967 --> 55:02.177
to take us home
to England.

55:02.344 --> 55:06.390
And Daddy and I were wond...
Well, I was wondering...

55:06.557 --> 55:10.853
Well, we really hope that you'll
come with us. Won't you?

55:12.396 --> 55:15.149
Go see England today,
come home tomorrow.

55:15.315 --> 55:17.442
Oh, no.

55:17.609 --> 55:21.822
Well, you see, it would be
very difficult to come back... ever.

55:21.989 --> 55:23.448
Not come back?

55:23.615 --> 55:26.618
Oh, no, no. I know it sounds awful,
but you belong with us.

55:26.785 --> 55:29.538
- With people.
- Jane must stay with Tarzan.

55:29.705 --> 55:32.624
Wh... Stay here?
Oh, no, no. My laundry!

55:32.791 --> 55:36.753
No, I can't stay.
Look, I've got...

55:36.920 --> 55:39.214
I've got my father
and...

55:39.381 --> 55:42.843
Jane, stay.

55:43.010 --> 55:45.679
- But...
- Please.

55:47.931 --> 55:50.601
But... I can't.

55:52.811 --> 55:54.396
Women!

55:54.563 --> 55:57.316
How typical!
Thank you, Jones.

55:57.483 --> 56:01.612
Even if you hadn't grown up a savage,
you'd be lost.

56:01.778 --> 56:05.115
There are no trails
through a woman's heart.

56:05.574 --> 56:07.034
Jane is going.

56:07.659 --> 56:12.998
Yes. If only she could've spent
more time with the gorillas.

56:13.165 --> 56:15.334
She's so disappointed.

56:15.501 --> 56:18.170
Crushed, really.

56:18.921 --> 56:20.714
Sorry, old boy.

56:21.340 --> 56:24.843
Oh, well. I'd best
get Jane's things to the ship.

56:28.847 --> 56:31.767
Clayton!

56:31.934 --> 56:34.186
If Jane sees gorillas,

56:34.353 --> 56:36.188
she stays?

56:36.355 --> 56:39.566
Say, that's why she came,
isn't it?

56:42.027 --> 56:42.778
I'll do it.

56:43.403 --> 56:46.281
- Good man! Snipes?
- Sir?

56:46.365 --> 56:50.702
Get the boys together.
There's gonna be a change in plans.

56:50.953 --> 56:53.080
Terk, all you have to do
is get Kerchak out of the way.

56:53.247 --> 56:55.082
- What?
- I'd be happy to get Kerchak...

56:55.249 --> 56:58.460
Shut your trunk
and get me outta here.

56:59.419 --> 57:01.922
Can you believe that guy?

57:02.005 --> 57:04.675
Drops us like a newborn giraffe...
kerplop!

57:04.842 --> 57:07.886
Now waltzes in here
and expects us to just...

57:08.053 --> 57:10.848
Terk, I'm asking you
as a friend.

57:13.767 --> 57:16.103
With the face
and the eyes, and the...

57:16.270 --> 57:18.147
Aah! All right!

57:18.313 --> 57:20.732
But don't make me do
anything embarrassing.

57:21.567 --> 57:23.443
I'm gonna kill him!

57:23.861 --> 57:26.989
A- Actually, I thought that dress
was rather slimming on you.

57:27.156 --> 57:29.575
Oh, really? I thought it was
a little revealing and kind of...

57:33.078 --> 57:35.622
How does she move in this thing?

57:38.041 --> 57:39.877
Look out!

58:05.861 --> 58:09.364
- Oh, look, Daddy.
- Where? Wh... Wh...

58:09.531 --> 58:12.242
Jane!

58:12.409 --> 58:16.497
Be careful, Professor.

58:16.663 --> 58:19.708
She's beautiful.

58:19.875 --> 58:22.252
She's my mother.

58:22.419 --> 58:24.671
Th...
This is your...

58:27.132 --> 58:28.467
mother.

58:38.101 --> 58:39.770
Wh-What's happening?

58:39.937 --> 58:41.855
I don't know, Daddy.

58:42.022 --> 58:46.819
- Oh, it's getting away!
- No! You'll only frighten her more.

58:53.659 --> 58:57.371
Oh, yes. Absolutely, my dear.
Good idea.

58:57.538 --> 58:59.623
What are you doing?
Do you want to frighten them off?

58:59.790 --> 59:02.000
Get up!
Get...

59:02.167 --> 59:04.378
Don't get up.

59:35.826 --> 59:36.952
Hello.

59:41.832 --> 59:44.501
It's very nice
to meet you too.

59:46.503 --> 59:51.049
Oh, Your Majesty,
you're such a tease.

59:53.302 --> 59:56.638
Hello. Hello. Uh,
Archimedes Q. Porter at your service.

59:56.805 --> 59:58.765
Aah! Quite a grip you've got.

59:58.932 --> 01:00:01.518
Oh, thank you.

01:00:01.685 --> 01:00:04.354
Is that one of mine?

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.857
Oh, this is wonderful,
Mr Clayton!

01:00:07.024 --> 01:00:08.567
Look! Look!
Social grooming.

01:00:08.734 --> 01:00:11.820
Congratulations, Professor.

01:00:12.029 --> 01:00:15.324
Our dream has come true.

01:00:19.578 --> 01:00:21.413
Give me that! Hey, what're you doing?

01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:24.500
Stop that! Stop!
Hold on, now! Leave that!

01:00:25.292 --> 01:00:27.127
That is not
to be played with!

01:00:41.850 --> 01:00:44.353
- Can you teach me?
- Speak gorilla?

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.396
Mmm, yes.

01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:11.255
Good heavens!
What did I say?

01:01:12.422 --> 01:01:14.633
That Jane stays
with Tarzan.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:17.803
Stay?
But I thought we'd already...

01:01:18.387 --> 01:01:20.722
But, Tarzan, I, I...

01:01:20.889 --> 01:01:23.392
Whoa! Look out!

01:01:25.811 --> 01:01:28.814
- Is that my dress?
- Oh, no.

01:01:32.776 --> 01:01:35.487
Oh, Daddy.

01:01:35.654 --> 01:01:39.074
Give it to me!

01:01:42.327 --> 01:01:44.246
No!

01:02:02.347 --> 01:02:03.307
Go!

01:02:04.641 --> 01:02:07.644
- Wait! Wait! Tarzan!
- Go now!

01:02:07.811 --> 01:02:10.856
Jane, quickly!
Hurry! Come along.

01:02:30.792 --> 01:02:32.711
Kerchak, I didn't...

01:02:33.212 --> 01:02:37.132
- I'm sorry, I...
- I asked you to protect our family,

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:41.136
and you betrayed us all.

01:03:09.498 --> 01:03:12.334
I'm so confused.

01:03:14.378 --> 01:03:15.754
Come with me.

01:03:16.129 --> 01:03:19.508
There's something I should've
shown you long ago.

01:04:39.171 --> 01:04:40.589
Is this me?

01:04:44.885 --> 01:04:48.722
And this is my father,
and,

01:04:48.889 --> 01:04:51.099
and my...

01:04:52.059 --> 01:04:53.685
Now you know.

01:04:54.394 --> 01:04:58.565
Tarzan, I just want you
to be happy,

01:04:58.732 --> 01:05:00.859
whatever you decide.

01:05:48.991 --> 01:05:53.245
No matter where I go,
you will always be my mother.

01:05:57.457 --> 01:06:01.420
And you will always
be in my heart.

01:06:20.647 --> 01:06:22.816
Oh, goodbye, Tarzan.

01:06:22.983 --> 01:06:26.320
Tarzan!
I'm so glad you found us in time.

01:06:37.122 --> 01:06:38.415
Tarzan!

01:06:38.499 --> 01:06:42.044
We're too late!
I can't believe it!

01:06:42.169 --> 01:06:44.046
If you'd have pulled over
and asked for directions...

01:06:44.171 --> 01:06:46.423
We didn't get
to say goodbye.

01:06:46.548 --> 01:06:49.843
Yeah, well, good riddance!
All right? Who needs ya? Huh?

01:06:49.968 --> 01:06:54.598
Go on, get out of here, bald boy!
You ingrate! You bald ingrate!

01:06:54.723 --> 01:06:56.642
Go on and rot,
for all I care!

01:06:56.809 --> 01:06:58.685
Go!

01:07:00.896 --> 01:07:04.399
- What are you lookin' at?
- I'm gonna miss him too.

01:07:12.866 --> 01:07:15.410
Tarzan, you can't imagine
what's in store for you.

01:07:15.577 --> 01:07:18.705
You're going to see the world.
Everyone's going to want to meet you.

01:07:18.831 --> 01:07:20.707
Kings, scientists
and famous writers.

01:07:20.874 --> 01:07:24.294
Yes, Darwin and Kipling.
Queen Victoria.

01:07:24.461 --> 01:07:26.588
I haven't met her,
but I heard she's awfully nice.

01:07:26.755 --> 01:07:30.634
And I'll be with Jane?

01:07:30.801 --> 01:07:34.388
Yes, with Jane.

01:07:34.555 --> 01:07:36.932
Ooh! Slippery.

01:07:57.244 --> 01:07:58.328
Tarzan!

01:08:00.038 --> 01:08:00.956
Tarzan!

01:08:01.123 --> 01:08:03.625
Get him!

01:08:03.792 --> 01:08:06.962
Get him!

01:08:07.129 --> 01:08:09.631
- Tarzan!
- Jane!

01:08:31.361 --> 01:08:35.157
- What's going on here?
- Clayton. Clayton, help.

01:08:37.326 --> 01:08:38.952
Have we met?

01:08:42.122 --> 01:08:43.999
Ah, yes.

01:08:44.124 --> 01:08:46.001
The ape man.

01:08:46.835 --> 01:08:50.339
Clayton, you...
You...

01:08:52.049 --> 01:08:54.718
So sorry about
the rude welcome, old boy.

01:08:54.801 --> 01:08:57.136
But I couldn't have you
making a scene...

01:08:57.261 --> 01:09:00.640
when we put your furry friends
in their cages.

01:09:01.558 --> 01:09:03.977
- Why?
- Why?

01:09:04.394 --> 01:09:06.939
For 300 pounds sterling
a head.

01:09:07.439 --> 01:09:10.818
Actually, I have you
to thank, my boy.

01:09:11.234 --> 01:09:13.612
Couldn't have done it
without you.

01:09:16.073 --> 01:09:17.950
Lock him up
with the others.

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:24.413
Uh, that sounded
like Tarzan.

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:26.792
He sounded like,
like he was in trouble.

01:09:26.917 --> 01:09:31.255
Yeah, well, why doesn't he get his new
friends to help him? I don't care.

01:09:31.839 --> 01:09:33.590
That's it!

01:09:33.924 --> 01:09:36.969
I've had it with you
and your emotional constipation!

01:09:37.094 --> 01:09:40.096
Tarzan needs us,
and we're gonna help him!

01:09:40.221 --> 01:09:44.059
You got that?
Now, pipe down and hang on tight.

01:09:44.225 --> 01:09:46.310
We've got a boat to catch.

01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.740
I've never felt so alive!

01:09:58.824 --> 01:10:01.326
Good!
'Cause I'm gonna kill ya!

01:10:01.743 --> 01:10:03.662
No time for that now,
missy.

01:10:24.558 --> 01:10:26.894
Tarzan, it's no use.
Don't!

01:10:34.943 --> 01:10:37.571
- Clayton.
- Yes, Clayton.

01:10:37.738 --> 01:10:39.823
Clayton betrayed us all.

01:10:40.157 --> 01:10:43.076
- I'm so sorry, Tarzan.
- No.

01:10:43.243 --> 01:10:47.080
I did this.
I betrayed my family.

01:10:47.247 --> 01:10:49.082
Kerchak was right.

01:10:49.583 --> 01:10:54.254
Oh, those magnificent creatures,
shivering in cages!

01:10:54.421 --> 01:10:56.924
What is this world
coming to?

01:11:02.888 --> 01:11:05.432
Oh, by Jove,
don't know my own strength.

01:11:10.562 --> 01:11:11.980
What was that?

01:11:12.773 --> 01:11:14.858
You are an animal!

01:11:16.944 --> 01:11:18.445
That sounded just like an elephant.

01:11:18.821 --> 01:11:19.905
Tantor!

01:11:22.115 --> 01:11:23.075
Thanks, guys.

01:11:23.283 --> 01:11:27.079
I thought I would never see you again,
and here you are!

01:11:28.205 --> 01:11:31.166
Sometimes you embarrass me.

01:12:38.859 --> 01:12:41.570
Ah, I remember you.

01:12:43.363 --> 01:12:46.366
I think this one
will be better off stuffed.

01:13:00.672 --> 01:13:02.799
Charge!

01:13:08.597 --> 01:13:11.558
- You came back.
- I came home.

01:13:26.532 --> 01:13:27.574
Fire!

01:13:34.373 --> 01:13:38.293
You there! Take what you can
back to the boat!

01:13:40.629 --> 01:13:42.714
I've got some hunting
to do.

01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:44.800
Hey!

01:14:07.614 --> 01:14:08.407
Don't worry.

01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:10.742
I'm going to have you
out of this in a second.

01:14:15.372 --> 01:14:18.750
Right.
This should do the trick.

01:14:40.772 --> 01:14:42.483
Hiding, are we?

01:14:42.608 --> 01:14:44.943
- Go on!
- Clayton, you...

01:14:45.068 --> 01:14:48.614
I could use a challenge
because after I get rid of you,

01:14:48.739 --> 01:14:53.535
rounding up your little ape family
will be all too easy!

01:15:20.562 --> 01:15:22.731
Go ahead, shoot me.

01:15:26.109 --> 01:15:29.071
Be a man.

01:15:35.577 --> 01:15:37.162
Not a man like you!

01:16:07.401 --> 01:16:08.902
Clayton!

01:16:10.696 --> 01:16:13.240
Clayton, don't!

01:17:04.249 --> 01:17:06.126
Tarzan.

01:17:06.251 --> 01:17:09.463
Kerchak... forgive me.

01:17:11.048 --> 01:17:16.178
No. Forgive me
for not understanding...

01:17:16.303 --> 01:17:20.098
that you have always been
one of us.

01:17:21.975 --> 01:17:24.978
Our family
will look to you now.

01:17:27.439 --> 01:17:29.358
No, Kerchak.

01:17:29.441 --> 01:17:30.651
Take care of them,

01:17:33.278 --> 01:17:34.822
my son.

01:17:43.247 --> 01:17:46.458
Take care of them.

01:19:06.497 --> 01:19:10.584
London will seem so small
compared to all this.

01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:13.462
I will miss you, Jane.

01:19:13.587 --> 01:19:17.132
- Miss Porter!
- I, I know. I'm coming.

01:19:18.634 --> 01:19:22.805
Well, I suppose
we should say goodbye.

01:19:34.858 --> 01:19:35.901
Goodbye.

01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:49.206
Goodbye, Tarzan!
Goodbye.

01:19:49.331 --> 01:19:52.125
Oh, I'm going to miss
that boy.

01:20:01.135 --> 01:20:05.430
Jane, dear, I can't help feeling
that you should stay.

01:20:05.556 --> 01:20:10.310
Daddy, please don't. We've been through
all of this. I couldn't possibly st...

01:20:10.435 --> 01:20:14.773
I, I belong in England with you,
with people, and... Aah!

01:20:20.779 --> 01:20:22.573
But you love him.

01:20:27.744 --> 01:20:28.954
Go on.

01:20:54.855 --> 01:20:58.817
Thank you.
Thanks for getting my glove.

01:20:58.984 --> 01:21:00.819
Thank you.

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:12.581
Well...

01:21:16.210 --> 01:21:20.380
But, what...
What am I doing? Captain?

01:21:20.547 --> 01:21:22.633
Tell them that
you never found us. Eh?

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:26.261
After all, people get lost
in the jungle every day. Right?

01:21:26.637 --> 01:21:27.387
Tootle-pip!
