you, like, entered

No, no, no, no.
Don't "ladies" us.

We need you
to explain

00:25.984 --> 00:28.737
why you gave up your
Whitelighter powers.

00:28.778 --> 00:30.864
I recognize this is
a big change,

00:30.905 --> 00:33.742
and I will explain,
but I don't have time right now.

00:33.783 --> 00:35.410
Hey, Mel,

remember what Harry did

You'll orb away?
Yes.

useful power right now.

what I've gained.

Your boyfriend?

you usually dress?

Look, I'm just... (sighs)
I'm just gonna tell my mum

across the country for a boy.

06:13.414 --> 06:15.249
No, no, no, no.

06:15.291 --> 06:18.127
A handsome, charming boyfriend
with a voice like Harry Styles

06:18.169 --> 06:20.171

you anything you want, so...

to manifest a real date.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.476

06:33.518 --> 06:35.812
dancing, dessert,

romance.

No romance. No dancing.
No dessert.

06:42.443 --> 06:45.488
Yes romance, yes dancing,
and as for dessert...

06:46.531 --> 06:47.907
...we will look at the menu

06:47.949 --> 06:49.826
and decide,
depending on options.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.370
Okay, let's go.

So, last week,

07:04.882 --> 07:06.717
we found out that
city council is saying,

07:06.759 --> 07:09.762
"SafeSpace isn't zoned
for residential use."

07:09.804 --> 07:11.764
They're kicking the teens out.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.599

07:13.641 --> 07:14.934
No.

07:14.976 --> 07:17.645
But there's been a recall
in our district,

07:17.687 --> 07:20.481
and, uh, I'm gonna run.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.733
Really?
Yes. Someone
has to step up.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.653
We're having a meeting tonight,
and Swan-- she says hi--

07:25.695 --> 07:28.072
thought, given
your past advocacy,

07:28.114 --> 07:30.700
you'd be perf

07:30.741 --> 07:33.286
for my organizing
committee.

07:33.327 --> 07:36.122
Oh, I... I would love to,
but I...

07:36.164 --> 07:38.833
I just...
Too busy. I get it.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.251
Yeah.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.378
Plus Swanby.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.631
Oh, uh, yeah, yeah,

07:45.673 --> 07:47.258
the teens were
calling us Rubiwan,

07:47.300 --> 07:49.594
which sounded really
Jedi, so... (chuckles)

07:50.678 --> 07:52.221
I get how awkward

07:52.263 --> 07:53.848
this might be.
Oh, no,

07:53.890 --> 07:55.975
it's-it's not about that.
(chuckles)

07:56.017 --> 07:58.978
Just forget I ever said
anything. (chuckles)

08:06.110 --> 08:08.779
Swanby? Really?

08:08.821 --> 08:11.741
Oh. Hey, Mel.
Uh, sorry.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.659
I hope I'm not
out of bounds here.

08:13.701 --> 08:16.370
I just needed to
do some research.

08:16.412 --> 08:19.290
Join the club.
What's your subject?

08:19.332 --> 08:21.042
Um...

08:21.083 --> 08:23.920
(breathing heavily)
(heart beating loudly)

08:23.961 --> 08:26.964
Now, you've got to swear
not to tell my girls.

08:27.006 --> 08:29.342
Nothing.

08:29.383 --> 08:30.593
You're researching nothing?

08:30.635 --> 08:33.846
It's just...

08:33.888 --> 08:37.058
I met this creature

08:37.099 --> 08:38.976
who I need to figure out
how to heal.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.770
Well, good thing
you have healing powers.

08:40.811 --> 08:44.106
(chuckles) Yeah, well, this
creature is in stable condition,

08:44.148 --> 08:46.150
but its illness
keeps coming back.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.319
Hey, have you seen a text
on rebirth rituals?

08:48.361 --> 08:50.488
Uh... I...

08:51.906 --> 08:53.533
Um...
That one.

08:54.408 --> 08:56.452
Wait, why are you studying up

08:56.494 --> 08:59.163
on resurrections?
I-I wasn't,

08:59.205 --> 09:02.416
but my friend
had a lot of items,

09:02.458 --> 09:05.127
one of which
was this stone bowl,

09:05.169 --> 09:07.380
which it was
dealing with

09:07.421 --> 09:09.173
just before its symptoms began.

09:09.215 --> 09:12.134
Anyway, the bowl is related
to the Pink Moon,

09:12.176 --> 09:13.970
so I was just...
Really?

09:14.011 --> 09:15.096
The Pink Moon?

09:15.137 --> 09:16.764
Y-Yeah.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.641
That's literally what I just
came here to research.

09:18.683 --> 09:21.227
Whoa.
Maybe there's a connection

09:21.269 --> 09:22.520
between the resurrection tonight

09:22.562 --> 09:23.729
and what's happening
with this...

09:23.771 --> 09:25.022
Furry-ear guy.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.941
The bowl, where is it?

09:26.983 --> 09:29.610
Can you take me to it?
Now?

09:29.652 --> 09:31.529
Right now.
Come on.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.863
Yeah.

much interest in them before.

20:57.506 --> 21:00.050
Okay, well,
it's-it's really nothing.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.885
I mean, I-I just...

21:01.927 --> 21:04.638
needed the blanket
for an art piece that I'm doing.

21:06.014 --> 21:08.809
And, besides,
it doesn't change

21:08.850 --> 21:11.937
how I feel
about you or-or Dad.

21:11.979 --> 21:13.897
Oh.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.566
So good to hear.

21:16.608 --> 21:20.195
It's-it's so hard to suddenly
be so far away, all the way

21:20.237 --> 21:22.864
across the country.

21:22.906 --> 21:25.617
Um... Yeah.

21:25.659 --> 21:28.996
Yeah, I-I know,
Mom, but...

21:29.037 --> 21:32.416
no matter where I am,

21:32.457 --> 21:35.377
you know I'm always gonna be
your Little Ba-Ba-Boo.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.546
(chuckles)

21:37.587 --> 21:39.423
Since I first
saw you,

21:39.464 --> 21:41.925
my Ba-Ba-Boo.

21:43.051 --> 21:45.846
Oh. I forgot
to tell Dev something.

21:45.887 --> 21:47.222
I'll be right back, okay?

21:47.264 --> 21:48.765
(chuckles)

21:48.807 --> 21:50.726
That's not my mother.

21:50.767 --> 21:52.394
What do you mean?
I mean,

21:52.436 --> 21:54.479
the whole idea of eggs
for breakfast, she would've

21:54.521 --> 21:57.691
insisted that we go out and buy
ingredients for Hausa koko,

21:57.733 --> 21:59.484
but "Ba-Ba-Boo"?

21:59.526 --> 22:01.862
Who? What? Who?
Ba-Ba-Boo.

22:01.903 --> 22:04.239
I told her I'll always be
her Little Ba-Ba-Boo,

22:04.281 --> 22:06.408
and she agreed.
What is that?

22:06.450 --> 22:08.285
Nothing. I made it up.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.703
You mean
someone is...

22:09.745 --> 22:13.457

impers... imperf...

22:13.498 --> 22:15.542

MEL:
Okay, so thanks to the
Tongue of Babel Spell,

24:24.838 --> 24:26.381
the rough translation
from Old Persian is...

24:26.423 --> 24:29.050
hard to figure out.

24:29.092 --> 24:32.429
Something about a ceremony?

24:32.471 --> 24:34.931
"A union of disparate souls

24:34.973 --> 24:36.766
defeat an imminent threat."

24:36.808 --> 24:38.643
What's the imminent threat?

24:38.685 --> 24:41.480
Probably the big, terrifying
thing Maggie saw in her vision.

24:41.521 --> 24:43.815
But look.

24:44.941 --> 24:46.443
"Should this bowl

24:46.485 --> 24:48.653
"be disturbed by human hands,

24:51.114 --> 24:52.782
The disturber of the bowl is...

24:52.824 --> 24:55.619
Ray. So his illness
and tonight's ritual

24:55.660 --> 24:57.829
are connected.

24:57.871 --> 25:00.832
(sighs) The question is:
Where is this happening,

25:00.874 --> 25:04.169
and how do we stop it
in less than 12 hours?

25:04.211 --> 25:06.505
I'm supposed to be a time witch.

25:06.546 --> 25:08.507
Who used to be able
to stop time.

25:08.548 --> 25:10.300
And now I just feel
like time is moving

25:10.342 --> 25:13.094
faster and faster,
and I am falling

25:13.136 --> 25:15.055
further and further behind.

25:15.096 --> 25:17.265
How do you eat an elephant?

25:19.851 --> 25:22.103
Why would anyone eat...
No one would. It's a saying.

25:22.145 --> 25:24.064
Oh.
How do you eat an elephant?

25:25.190 --> 25:27.567
By taking one bite at a time.

25:27.609 --> 25:30.362
Because if you think
about eating the whole elephant,

25:30.403 --> 25:33.281
it's... overwhelming.

25:33.323 --> 25:35.742
But if you think
one bite at a time...

25:37.619 --> 25:39.579
Stay in the moment.

25:39.621 --> 25:40.997

Let me try something.

25:57.764 --> 25:59.599
What if the rest
of these markings

25:59.641 --> 26:03.311
aren't more text...

26:04.437 --> 26:06.398
...but, like...

26:07.357 --> 26:08.567
...a map?

26:08.608 --> 26:10.777
So this attaches here,

26:10.819 --> 26:13.113
and this goes below.

26:13.154 --> 26:15.448
Go, Mel.
Ancient Persia.

26:15.490 --> 26:16.950
(Jordan chuckles)

26:16.992 --> 26:18.910
"X" marks the spot.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.954
And that spot...

26:20.996 --> 26:23.039
is in Northern Iran.

26:23.081 --> 26:26.001
So, good news, we know where
the ritual's going down, but...

26:26.042 --> 26:27.377
And the bad news?

26:27.419 --> 26:29.004
It's 11 and a half hours
later there,

26:29.045 --> 26:30.547
so it's already night.

26:32.799 --> 26:34.926
We have less
than 40 minutes

26:34.968 --> 26:36.678

its apex.

26:42.392 --> 26:44.060

Okay, w-we're not talking
about that right now, okay?

26:51.943 --> 26:53.695

magical painkillers.

26:53.737 --> 26:56.156
Let me help you.
No, Dev,
