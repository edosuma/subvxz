00:48.503 --> 00:50.631
<i>In our relations with other people,</i>

00:50.738 --> 00:54.799
<i>we mainly discuss and evaluate</i>

00:54.909 --> 00:57.537
<i>their character and behavior.</i>

00:58.546 --> 01:03.109
<i>That is why I have withdrawn</i>

01:03.217 --> 01:05.879
<i>from nearly all so-called relations.</i>

01:07.321 --> 01:12.055
<i>This has made my old age
rather lonely.</i>

01:13.628 --> 01:19.589
<i>My life has been full of hard work,
and I am grateful.</i>

01:19.701 --> 01:22.431
<i>It began as toil
for bread and butter</i>

01:22.538 --> 01:27.305
<i>and ended in a love for science.</i>

01:27.875 --> 01:33.609
<i>I have a son, also a doctor,
who lives in Lund.</i>

01:33.714 --> 01:38.708
<i>He has been married for many years.
They have no children.</i>

01:39.421 --> 01:45.381
<i>My old mother is still alive
and is very active, in spite of her age.</i>

01:50.565 --> 01:55.333
<i>My wife Karin
has been dead for many years.</i>

01:56.939 --> 01:58.735
Dinner is served, Professor Borg.

02:02.276 --> 02:04.369
Thank you.

02:04.478 --> 02:07.676
<i>I am lucky
in having a good housekeeper.</i>

02:08.949 --> 02:13.284
<i>Perhaps I should add
that I am an old pedant,</i>

02:14.456 --> 02:17.618
<i>which at times
has been rather trying</i>

02:17.725 --> 02:22.686
<i>for myself and those around me.</i>

02:24.800 --> 02:28.031
<i>My name is Isak Borg,</i>

02:28.970 --> 02:31.404
<i>and I am 78.</i>

02:32.506 --> 02:37.968
<i>Tomorrow I shall receive
an honorary degree in Lund Cathedral.</i>

02:53.327 --> 02:56.627
WILD STRAWBERRIES

03:57.426 --> 04:00.657
<i>In the early hours ofJune 1 st,</i>

04:00.761 --> 04:04.857
<i>I had a weird
and very unpleasant dream.</i>

04:05.734 --> 04:09.225
<i>I dreamt that during
my morning walk</i>

04:09.337 --> 04:14.866
<i>I lost my way among empty streets</i>

04:14.975 --> 04:17.466
<i>with ruined houses.</i>

09:27.856 --> 09:28.948
Are you ill?

09:29.057 --> 09:32.788
Miss Agda, please prepare
some breakfast. I'm taking the car.

09:32.894 --> 09:37.125
Please, Professor! Go back to bed
and I'll bring you coffee at 9:00,

09:37.231 --> 09:40.530
and we'll leave at 10:00 as planned.

09:40.635 --> 09:42.967
Oh, well, I'll go without breakfast.

09:45.372 --> 09:47.068
And who will pack your tails?

09:48.308 --> 09:51.209
- I will do it myself.
- And what about me?

09:52.579 --> 09:58.212
You can come in the car or fly.
Please yourself.

09:58.318 --> 10:02.948
I've looked forward to seeing you get
your honorary degree.

10:03.058 --> 10:06.925
And we had arranged
everything so nicely,

10:07.028 --> 10:10.327
and now you're taking the car.

10:10.432 --> 10:13.059
The ceremony isn't until 5:00.

10:13.168 --> 10:16.694
If I leave at once, I've got 14 hours
before the ceremony.

10:16.804 --> 10:19.273
You'll ruin everything!

10:20.475 --> 10:24.001
What about your son who is expecting you
at the airport in Malmo?

10:24.111 --> 10:28.071
You can think up an explanation.

10:30.985 --> 10:34.112
If you go by car,
I won't come at all.

10:35.457 --> 10:37.549
Now listen, Miss Agda!

10:37.659 --> 10:42.687
Take the car, and you'll ruin
the greatest day of my life.

10:42.797 --> 10:45.231
We're not married, Miss Agda.

10:45.332 --> 10:49.895
I thank God for that every night.

10:50.004 --> 10:54.463
I've used my common sense for 74 years,
and it won't let me down now.

10:54.576 --> 10:57.067
Is that your last word?

10:57.178 --> 10:59.111
Yes.

11:01.281 --> 11:06.810
But I shall say plenty to myself
about selfish, crabby old men

11:06.920 --> 11:12.483
who never think of those who have
served them faithfully for 40 years.

11:12.593 --> 11:15.586
Incredible that I have put up...

11:15.697 --> 11:20.566
with your bossing for so long.

11:20.668 --> 11:24.103
Just give the word,
and I'll leave tomorrow.

11:24.204 --> 11:29.643
I'm going by car anyway,
and you can do as you damn well please.

11:36.518 --> 11:42.478
I happen to be grown-up
and needn't take orders from you.

11:46.895 --> 11:50.023
No one can pack like you, Miss Agda.

11:50.130 --> 11:51.928
Really?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.467
Old sourpuss.

11:54.568 --> 11:56.502
Shall I boil you a couple of eggs?

11:56.603 --> 12:01.040
Yes, please, if you will be
so extremely kind.

12:06.146 --> 12:11.414
The faculty should have made me
honorary idiot.

12:15.557 --> 12:18.856
I'll calm the old girl down
with a present.

12:18.959 --> 12:21.655
I hate resentful people.

12:21.763 --> 12:26.358
I wouldn't hurt a fly,
let alone Miss Agda.

12:27.434 --> 12:29.062
Toast?

12:29.169 --> 12:31.365
No, don't trouble yourself
on my account.

12:31.472 --> 12:34.372
What are you cross about?

12:40.114 --> 12:41.808
Don't you want a cup?

12:48.188 --> 12:49.520
Good morning, Uncle Isak.

12:49.624 --> 12:54.323
Well, well, why is my daughter-in-law
up at this hour?

12:54.428 --> 12:58.024
Who can sleep when you and Aunt Agda
are making such a row?

12:58.131 --> 13:00.429
There has been no row.

13:00.534 --> 13:02.230
No, not at all.

13:04.172 --> 13:06.163
You're taking the car to Lund?

13:06.274 --> 13:07.298
Yes.

13:07.408 --> 13:09.136
Can I come with you?

13:09.244 --> 13:10.768
You're going home?

13:10.877 --> 13:13.711
Yes, I want to go home.

13:13.814 --> 13:15.544
Home to Evald?

13:15.650 --> 13:17.276
You don't need to ask why.

13:17.385 --> 13:20.047
I would take the train
if I could afford it.

13:20.154 --> 13:22.418
Of course you may ride with me.

13:22.523 --> 13:24.047
I'll be ready in ten minutes.

13:27.694 --> 13:29.252
Good heavens!

13:57.592 --> 14:01.995
Please don't smoke.
I can't stand cigarette smoke.

14:02.096 --> 14:03.495
I forgot.

14:03.597 --> 14:06.896
There should be a law
forbidding women to smoke.

14:08.101 --> 14:09.364
Beautiful weather.

14:09.470 --> 14:13.270
Yes, but sultry.

14:14.042 --> 14:16.510
- I think we'll have a thunderstorm.
- So do I.

14:16.611 --> 14:18.237
No, give me a cigar anytime.

14:18.346 --> 14:21.645
That's stimulating and relaxing.
That's a vice for men.

14:21.749 --> 14:24.717
And what vices may a woman have?

14:24.818 --> 14:27.947
Weeping, giving birth
and speaking ill of her neighbors.

14:28.055 --> 14:30.819
How old are you really, Uncle Isak?

14:30.924 --> 14:32.289
Why do you ask?

14:32.393 --> 14:34.155
No reason. Why?

14:34.261 --> 14:37.163
I know why you asked.

14:37.265 --> 14:39.289
Oh, well.

14:41.635 --> 14:45.629
Don't pretend.
You don't like me. You never have.

14:45.740 --> 14:48.174
I only know you
as a father-in-law.

14:48.275 --> 14:50.266
Why are you going home?

14:50.377 --> 14:52.278
On impulse. Nothing more.

14:52.380 --> 14:54.644
Evald happens to be my son.

14:54.749 --> 14:56.182
So he is.

14:56.284 --> 14:59.741
Evald and I are very much alike.
We have our principles.

14:59.853 --> 15:01.718
<i>You don't need to tell me that.</i>

15:01.823 --> 15:03.222
Now, this loan, for instance.

15:03.323 --> 15:05.188
I know exactly
what you're going to say.

15:05.293 --> 15:07.989
He should have paid it back
when he became an associate professor.

15:08.096 --> 15:10.655
It's a matter of honor for him
to pay back 5,000 a year,

15:10.765 --> 15:12.096
and so on, and so on.

15:12.199 --> 15:14.134
A promise is a promise.

15:14.235 --> 15:17.068
For us, it means
that we never can be free together,

15:17.170 --> 15:19.071
and that your son
works himself to death.

15:19.173 --> 15:21.539
You have your own income.

15:21.641 --> 15:23.506
Especially when one considers
the fact that you're filthy rich

15:23.611 --> 15:24.976
and don't need the money.

15:25.078 --> 15:30.675
A promise is a promise.
And I know Evald respects that.

15:31.718 --> 15:34.153
Perhaps.
But he also hates you.

15:44.531 --> 15:47.967
What do you have against me?

15:48.068 --> 15:49.764
Shall I be frank?

15:49.871 --> 15:51.202
Yes, I'm asking you.

15:52.506 --> 15:55.067
You're a selfish old man, Uncle Isak.

15:55.175 --> 15:59.635
You're utterly ruthless
and never listen to anyone but yourself.

16:00.715 --> 16:05.708
But you hide it all behind
your old-world manners and charm.

16:06.721 --> 16:12.216
Beneath your benevolent exterior,
you're as hard as nails.

16:13.126 --> 16:17.529
But you can't fool us
who have seen you at close quarters.

16:19.299 --> 16:22.063
Remember when
I came to you a month ago?

16:23.770 --> 16:26.638
I had a stupid idea
that you might help Evald and me.

16:26.741 --> 16:29.208
So I asked to stay with you
for a week or two.

16:29.309 --> 16:31.778
Remember what you answered?

16:31.879 --> 16:34.904
I said I'd be delighted.

16:36.183 --> 16:39.620
Perhaps you've forgotten,
but you said,

16:40.688 --> 16:44.749
"Don't try to draw me
into your marital squabbles.

16:44.891 --> 16:46.587
I don't give a damn.

16:46.693 --> 16:48.684
You and Evald must make
the best of it."

16:48.795 --> 16:50.353
Did I say that?

16:50.465 --> 16:53.730
- Not only that.
- Oh, no.

16:53.834 --> 16:55.529
These were your very words:

16:56.437 --> 16:58.769
"I have no respect
for mental suffering,

16:58.872 --> 17:00.807
<i>so don't come lamenting to me.</i>

17:01.641 --> 17:06.340
If you need therapy,
you'd better see a shrink.

17:06.446 --> 17:10.041
Or why not a minister?
It's in fashion now."

17:10.150 --> 17:11.880
Did I say that?

17:12.553 --> 17:15.579
Your judgments are very categorical,
Uncle Isak.

17:15.689 --> 17:19.090
I should hate to depend on you.

17:23.430 --> 17:27.423
I have liked having you
about the house.

17:27.534 --> 17:29.229
Like a cat.

17:29.336 --> 17:31.703
A cat or a human being.

17:31.805 --> 17:37.038
You're a fine young woman,
and I'm sorry you dislike me.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.805
- I don't dislike you.
- Really?

17:39.913 --> 17:42.143
- I feel sorry for you.
- Sorry?

17:46.853 --> 17:50.880
I'd like to tell you about a dream
I had this morning.

17:50.992 --> 17:53.290
I'm not very interested in dreams.

17:53.393 --> 17:57.262
No. No, of course not.

18:10.444 --> 18:12.435
Where are you going now?

18:12.546 --> 18:15.107
I want to show you something.

18:48.082 --> 18:53.611
We lived here every summer
during the first 20 years of my life.

18:53.720 --> 18:57.282
There were ten of us children.
Perhaps you knew that.

18:58.793 --> 19:00.283
Does anyone live here now?

19:00.393 --> 19:02.122
No, not this summer.

19:06.233 --> 19:08.928
I'll go swimming, if you don't mind.
We have plenty of time.

19:09.035 --> 19:10.560
Yes, by all means, do.

19:23.583 --> 19:26.450
The place where
wild strawberries grow!

19:38.698 --> 19:42.533
<i>Perhaps I got a little sentimental.</i>

19:43.771 --> 19:46.501
<i>Perhaps I got a little tired</i>

19:46.607 --> 19:49.200
<i>and felt a bit sad.</i>

19:50.844 --> 19:56.147
<i>It's not impossible that I began
to think of this and that,</i>

19:56.249 --> 19:59.912
<i>associated with places
where I played as a child.</i>

20:01.255 --> 20:03.688
<i>I don't know how it happened,</i>

20:04.725 --> 20:07.216
<i>but the day's clear reality</i>

20:07.328 --> 20:12.493
<i>dissolved into the even clearer
images of memory</i>

20:12.600 --> 20:15.091
<i>that appeared before my eyes</i>

20:15.201 --> 20:18.069
<i>with the strength
of a true stream of events.</i>

20:35.589 --> 20:36.351
Sara.

20:39.392 --> 20:41.088
Sara,

20:41.795 --> 20:44.161
it's your cousin Isak.

20:45.900 --> 20:50.893
Well, I've become quite old,
of course, so I don't look the same.

20:51.971 --> 20:57.706
But you, you haven't changed at all.

21:03.617 --> 21:06.552
Good morning, sweet cousin.
What are you doing?

21:06.653 --> 21:08.849
Picking strawberries, silly.
Can't you see?

21:09.823 --> 21:12.451
And who shall be favored
with these delicious berries

21:12.560 --> 21:16.325
picked in the early morn
by a lovely young woman?

21:16.429 --> 21:19.831
Nonsense. You know quite well
that it's Uncle Aron's name day today.

21:19.934 --> 21:22.300
I forgot to make a present.

21:22.402 --> 21:25.031
So he'll get a basket
of wild strawberries instead.

21:25.139 --> 21:26.298
I'll help you.

21:26.407 --> 21:29.934
You see, Sigbritt and Charlotta made
a tapestry and Angelica baked a cake,

21:30.044 --> 21:31.773
and Anna has painted
a really good picture,

21:31.879 --> 21:34.905
and Kristina and Birgitta
wrote a song that they'll sing to him.

21:35.015 --> 21:38.041
That's the best one.
Uncle Aron is stone-deaf.

21:38.151 --> 21:40.985
He'll be very pleased,
and you're stupid.

21:41.088 --> 21:43.522
And you have a darned cute nape.

21:45.993 --> 21:47.516
You know you shouldn't do that.

21:47.628 --> 21:50.119
<i>- Says who?
- I say.</i>

21:50.230 --> 21:52.927
Besides, you're an unusually
insufferable young man

21:53.033 --> 21:54.694
who thinks he's really something.

21:54.802 --> 21:57.133
I'm your cousin,
and you're in love with me.

21:58.072 --> 21:59.300
With you!

22:00.841 --> 22:02.399
Come and be kissed on the lips.

22:03.611 --> 22:07.707
If you don't behave, I'll tell Isak
you're always trying to kiss me.

22:07.814 --> 22:11.342
Little Isak! I could beat him up
with one arm.

22:12.018 --> 22:14.816
You know quite well that Isak and I
are secretly engaged.

22:14.921 --> 22:18.619
So secretly, everyone knows it.

22:18.726 --> 22:21.752
It's not my fault that the twins
let the cat out of the bag.

22:21.861 --> 22:25.854
When is the wedding?
When is the wedding?

22:26.900 --> 22:31.838
I don't know which of you four brothers
is the least conceited,

22:31.938 --> 22:34.304
but I think it's Isak.

22:34.408 --> 22:35.966
Isak is the nicest, anyway.

22:36.075 --> 22:38.737
And you're the horridest, nastiest,

22:38.845 --> 22:43.715
silliest, stupidest...
I can't find the words to describe you!

22:43.817 --> 22:46.911
Admit you've got
a weak spot for me.

22:47.021 --> 22:49.387
And you reek of cigars.

22:49.489 --> 22:51.253
It's a nice manly smell.

22:53.259 --> 22:57.286
<i>And the twins,
who know most things,</i>

22:57.398 --> 23:02.233
say you've been up to no good
with that Berglund girl.

23:02.335 --> 23:07.706
She's not a nice girl, the twins say.
And I agree.

23:07.807 --> 23:11.175
How pretty you are
when you blush.

23:11.277 --> 23:14.543
<i>You must kiss me.
I can't bear it any longer.</i>

23:14.648 --> 23:19.016
Now that I think of it,
I'm madly in love with you.

23:19.119 --> 23:21.313
- You're just saying that.
- No.

23:23.623 --> 23:26.320
And the twins say

23:26.427 --> 23:29.554
<i>that you're mad about girls.</i>

23:29.763 --> 23:31.390
Is that true?

23:41.207 --> 23:43.835
Oh, look what you've done!

23:44.978 --> 23:49.210
And what will Isak say,
who really loves me?

23:50.383 --> 23:54.878
I'm so sad!
You've hurt me so!

23:56.556 --> 23:58.990
You've made
a bad woman of me.

23:59.092 --> 24:01.118
<i>At any rate, nearly.</i>

24:01.227 --> 24:04.788
I never want to see you again,
at least not before brunch.

24:05.232 --> 24:08.724
I have to hurry.
Help me pick up the strawberries.

24:09.669 --> 24:12.400
Oh, and now I've got
a stain on my apron!

24:41.802 --> 24:45.362
Where's Isak?

24:46.073 --> 24:50.873
Out fishing with Papa,
and they can't hear the gong.

24:50.977 --> 24:56.938
Anyway, Papa said
not to wait with brunch.

25:46.833 --> 25:49.028
In Jesus' name
we take our seat.

25:49.136 --> 25:52.572
Bless, O Lord,
this food we eat. Amen.

26:01.415 --> 26:04.543
Benjamin, go and wash
your hands at once.

26:04.650 --> 26:07.552
How old do you have to be
to learn cleanliness?

26:07.653 --> 26:09.178
<i>I have.</i>

26:10.024 --> 26:13.720
Sigbritt, pass Angelica the porridge.

26:13.826 --> 26:17.194
Your fingernails are filthy.

26:18.165 --> 26:19.563
Hagbart, pass the bread.

26:21.601 --> 26:24.729
Don't take so much butter.

26:24.838 --> 26:28.831
Charlotta, the salt is lumpy.
You let it get damp.

26:28.941 --> 26:31.034
How often have I told you
not to let it sit out?

26:31.144 --> 26:34.409
<i>It's paint under my nails.</i>

26:34.515 --> 26:36.312
Who gathered
the wild strawberries for me?

26:36.417 --> 26:38.908
- I did.
- What?

26:40.420 --> 26:44.083
Speak up, dear.
Uncle Aron can't hear.

26:44.190 --> 26:47.024
I did!

26:47.127 --> 26:50.755
Fancy your remembering
my name day.

26:50.863 --> 26:53.093
How kind of you.

26:53.867 --> 26:58.099
Couldn't Uncle have a drink
to celebrate?

26:58.205 --> 27:00.900
Never when Papa is not at home.

27:01.675 --> 27:05.007
Uncle has already had three drinks.

27:05.111 --> 27:09.014
We saw him when we went out
to bathe at 8:00.

27:09.115 --> 27:11.413
So you've picked berries too.
Thank you.

27:11.517 --> 27:14.315
Twins, speak when spoken to.

27:15.922 --> 27:19.380
And as you didn't make your beds,
you can dry the silver.

27:20.794 --> 27:23.627
You will do as Auntie says.

27:23.729 --> 27:26.426
Benjamin, don't bite your nails.

27:26.533 --> 27:30.060
Anna, what are you doing?
Remember you're not a little girl anymore.

27:30.169 --> 27:32.070
I want to give Uncle my picture.

27:32.171 --> 27:34.936
Please, Auntie, can't we give him
our presents now?

27:35.042 --> 27:36.804
- Where is your present?
- Under the table.

27:36.909 --> 27:38.604
No, after we've eaten.

27:39.912 --> 27:44.646
A very advanced work of art:
Fritjof and Ingeborg.

27:44.751 --> 27:48.619
You can't tell which is Fritjof!

27:48.721 --> 27:53.988
What were Sara and Sigfrid doing
in the wild strawberry patch?

27:54.093 --> 27:56.960
We saw you! We saw you!

27:57.063 --> 27:59.726
The twins ought to be muzzled.

27:59.832 --> 28:01.926
The twins will be quiet
or leave the table.

28:02.034 --> 28:03.559
No freedom of speech, eh?

28:03.669 --> 28:05.570
Shut up, you brats.

28:06.239 --> 28:09.732
Sara's blushing! Sara's blushing!

28:10.776 --> 28:13.803
Sigfrid is blushing too!
Sigfrid and Sara! Sigfrid and Sara!

28:13.913 --> 28:15.778
Quiet, everybody!

28:19.253 --> 28:20.743
But Sara!

28:20.853 --> 28:22.822
They're lying! They're lying!

28:48.548 --> 28:54.509
Isak is so fine and good,

28:55.721 --> 28:59.919
so moral and sensitive.

29:00.026 --> 29:03.155
He wants us to read poetry

29:03.697 --> 29:05.995
and talk about the next life

29:06.099 --> 29:09.659
and play four-handed piano.

29:11.371 --> 29:14.772
And he only wants to kiss
in the dark,

29:16.008 --> 29:18.670
and he talks about sin.

29:18.778 --> 29:21.440
He's on such a terribly high level,

29:22.783 --> 29:25.274
and I feel so worthless.

29:26.820 --> 29:30.516
<i>And I am worthless...
there's no denying it.</i>

29:34.026 --> 29:37.656
But sometimes it seems to me
that I'm a lot older than Isak,

29:37.764 --> 29:40.027
if you know what I mean.

29:40.132 --> 29:44.695
And then I think he's a child,
although we're the same age.

29:45.871 --> 29:51.207
And Sigfrid is so bold and exciting,
and I want to go home.

29:51.311 --> 29:53.471
I don't want to be here all summer

29:53.580 --> 29:56.104
and be an object of ridicule
for the twins and all of you.

29:56.216 --> 29:58.207
I don't want to!

29:58.317 --> 30:00.547
I'll speak to Sigfrid.

30:00.653 --> 30:02.121
If he doesn't behave,

30:02.221 --> 30:04.656
I'll make sure he's made to study
during the summer holidays.

30:04.757 --> 30:06.419
Papa will fix that
as easy as anything.

30:06.525 --> 30:09.460
He too thinks Sigfrid is a
good-for-nothing and needs to work.

30:09.563 --> 30:13.054
Poor little Isak
who's so good to me.

30:14.368 --> 30:16.928
How unfair everything is.

30:18.572 --> 30:20.733
All will be well, you'll see.

30:20.841 --> 30:23.900
Listen, now they're singing
for Uncle Aron.

30:25.211 --> 30:30.514
How silly to write a song
for a deaf old man.

30:30.617 --> 30:32.244
How typical of the twins.

30:32.351 --> 30:37.255
<i>Flowers nod, grasses bow</i>

30:37.357 --> 30:42.817
<i>Around our lovely house</i>

30:42.928 --> 30:48.492
<i>We our Uncle Aron celebrate</i>

30:48.601 --> 30:50.570
<i>And with our song</i>

30:50.670 --> 30:55.040
<i>Ornament his brow</i>

30:55.742 --> 30:59.438
Four cheers for Uncle Aron.

30:59.545 --> 31:03.641
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!

31:10.923 --> 31:13.255
I'll run down and meet
Isak and Uncle.

31:13.360 --> 31:14.850
You do that.

31:15.762 --> 31:21.291
<i>I was overwhelmed by feelings
of emptiness and sadness,</i>

31:21.668 --> 31:25.364
<i>but was soon awakened
from my reveries</i>

31:26.505 --> 31:29.907
<i>by the voice of a young girl
asking me repeatedly about something.</i>

31:30.009 --> 31:31.841
Is this your house?

31:31.945 --> 31:34.037
No, it's not.

31:34.147 --> 31:36.478
You're lucky to be telling the truth.

31:36.582 --> 31:39.416
It's my dad who owns the whole
headland, including the house.

31:39.518 --> 31:43.420
I lived here once.
Two hundred years ago.

31:43.523 --> 31:45.821
Oh, yeah?

31:46.226 --> 31:49.457
- Is that your car up at the gate?
- Yes, that's my car.

31:49.563 --> 31:50.688
Looks antique.

31:50.796 --> 31:53.630
Yes, it's antique, like its owner.

31:54.400 --> 31:58.769
So you have self-irony too.
That's fantastic.

31:58.871 --> 32:00.897
Where are you going?
I mean, in which direction?

32:01.006 --> 32:02.838
Well, I'm going to Lund.

32:02.942 --> 32:05.571
But that suits me perfectly.
You see, I'm on my way to Italy.

32:05.678 --> 32:08.409
I'm honored.

32:08.515 --> 32:10.846
My name's Sara.
Silly name, isn't it?

32:10.950 --> 32:14.284
My name's Isak.
It's silly too.

32:14.388 --> 32:15.650
Weren't they married?

32:15.755 --> 32:20.591
No, unfortunately.
That was Abraham and Sara.

32:20.694 --> 32:21.820
Let's leave, then.

32:21.928 --> 32:25.762
I have another lady with me.
Here she comes.

32:25.865 --> 32:28.733
- Marianne, this is Sara.
- Hello.

32:28.834 --> 32:30.803
We're going to have company
as far as Lund.

32:30.903 --> 32:34.862
Sara's off to Italy, but she's promised
to ride a ways with us.

32:34.975 --> 32:38.138
Ironic again, but it suits you.

32:38.945 --> 32:40.435
Let's be off.

32:45.284 --> 32:48.448
Hey, guys, I've got a lift
almost to Italy.

32:48.554 --> 32:54.515
That's Anders and that's Viktor
and this is Father Isak.

32:56.929 --> 33:00.331
That peach you're gaping at
is Marianne.

33:03.969 --> 33:05.596
What a big bus.

33:05.705 --> 33:07.639
Yes, there's room for us all.

33:07.740 --> 33:11.871
Put your luggage in the trunk,
if you don't mind.

33:27.294 --> 33:31.229
I must tell you, Isak,
that Anders and I are going steady.

33:31.331 --> 33:33.093
We're crazy about each other.

33:34.100 --> 33:36.466
Viktor's the chaperone.
Daddy insisted.

33:37.803 --> 33:42.764
Viktor is in love with me too.

33:42.876 --> 33:45.743
It's a brilliant move of Daddy's.

33:45.845 --> 33:49.303
I may have to seduce Viktor
to get rid of him.

33:50.550 --> 33:54.850
I'd better tell you I'm a virgin.
That's why I'm so cheeky.

33:54.955 --> 33:56.979
And I smoke a pipe.

33:57.090 --> 34:02.187
Viktor says it's good for you.
He's crazy about anything healthy.

34:04.096 --> 34:07.032
I was once in love
with a woman called Sara.

34:07.132 --> 34:09.532
No! She was like me, wasn't she?

34:09.635 --> 34:12.536
She was, actually.

34:12.639 --> 34:14.197
What happened to her?

34:14.306 --> 34:18.675
She married my brother Sigfrid
and had six children.

34:18.777 --> 34:22.713
She's 75 now
and quite a beautiful old lady.

34:22.815 --> 34:25.443
I can't think of anything worse
than growing old.

34:26.851 --> 34:31.083
<i>Oh, dear,
now I have put my foot in it.</i>

35:14.467 --> 35:15.934
Are you all right?

35:16.035 --> 35:19.061
I have no excuse.
It's all our fault.

35:19.171 --> 35:25.133
My wife was driving.
Are you all right?

35:25.912 --> 35:31.407
The murderers must introduce
themselves! My name's Alman.

35:32.052 --> 35:34.986
That's my wife Berit.
You can see she has been an actress.

35:35.088 --> 35:37.954
That's the complication
we were discussing when...

35:38.057 --> 35:40.218
Come here, Berit,
and say you're sorry.

35:40.327 --> 35:43.990
I'm so sorry.
It was all my fault.

35:44.097 --> 35:48.430
I was just going to hit my husband
when that curve appeared.

35:48.535 --> 35:53.700
God punishes some people at once,
eh, you Catholic?

35:53.807 --> 35:56.798
Let's get your car upright.

35:56.910 --> 35:59.673
- Oh, never mind us. Please.
- Shut up, Sten.

35:59.778 --> 36:04.238
<i>Some people are unselfish,
though you don't think so.</i>

36:06.820 --> 36:11.086
My wife is a little nervous.
We've had a shock.

36:12.925 --> 36:17.760
Just look at him measuring
his strength with the youngsters,

36:17.863 --> 36:23.631
straining his flabby muscles
to show off in front of that cute girl.

36:29.376 --> 36:32.675
Darling, you might have a stroke.

36:35.414 --> 36:37.780
My wife likes ridiculing me.

36:37.883 --> 36:40.785
I let her.
It's psychotherapy.

37:44.450 --> 37:49.046
I never know whether my wife
is really crying or just playacting.

37:50.090 --> 37:52.057
I'll be damned if it isn't real.

37:54.894 --> 37:57.727
It happens when you catch
a glimpse of death.

37:57.831 --> 37:59.856
Can't you shut up?

37:59.965 --> 38:02.695
<i>My wife can really live a part.</i>

38:03.535 --> 38:07.028
For two years,
she made me think she had cancer

38:07.139 --> 38:10.700
and plagued us
with every possible symptom,

38:10.809 --> 38:13.642
even though the doctors
could find nothing wrong with her.

38:13.747 --> 38:19.514
Eventually we believed her
more than the doctors!

38:19.619 --> 38:21.814
It's natural that you're upset,

38:21.921 --> 38:24.354
but why not leave your wife
in peace for a while?

38:24.456 --> 38:26.822
A woman has a right
to her tears, eh?

38:26.925 --> 38:30.053
Don't get in the way
of a woman's tears.

38:31.497 --> 38:36.197
You are beautiful,
but old Berit's a bit past her prime.

38:36.302 --> 38:37.997
<i>So you can afford to defend her.</i>

38:38.104 --> 38:41.561
I sympathize with her.
For several reasons.

38:41.673 --> 38:43.800
Very sarcastic!

38:43.910 --> 38:46.309
Yet you don't seem
in the least hysterical.

38:47.079 --> 38:50.481
But little Berit is.

38:50.849 --> 38:53.044
Do you know
what that means for me?

38:53.153 --> 38:54.950
I gather you're a Catholic.

38:55.053 --> 38:57.488
Quite right.
That's how I stand it.

38:57.590 --> 38:59.921
We ridicule each other.

39:00.026 --> 39:02.289
She has her hysteria.
I have my Catholicism.

39:02.394 --> 39:05.626
So, you see,
we need each other.

39:05.731 --> 39:08.825
It's only egoism
that we haven't killed each other.

39:19.111 --> 39:21.137
There it came.

39:21.247 --> 39:24.477
That's what is called syncopes,
isn't it?

39:26.852 --> 39:29.151
Very funny.

39:32.624 --> 39:36.686
If I'd had a stopwatch,
I could have timed the explosion.

39:36.796 --> 39:39.959
Shut up! Shut up!

39:45.537 --> 39:48.735
This may be too blunt,

39:49.843 --> 39:53.573
but for the children's sake,
will you please get out.

40:03.122 --> 40:06.113
Forgive us, if you can.

40:36.622 --> 40:40.218
<i>It was with mixed feelings
I saw this region again.</i>

40:40.827 --> 40:43.557
<i>I had my first practice here,</i>

40:44.130 --> 40:48.293
<i>and my old mother lives nearby.</i>

40:58.644 --> 41:00.738
Hello there, Doctor.

41:02.148 --> 41:04.479
So you're in these parts again,
Doctor?

41:04.584 --> 41:07.677
Shall I fill it up?
Pass me the key to the hood.

41:10.490 --> 41:12.981
Eva! Come here a moment!

41:15.061 --> 41:18.519
It's Dr. Borg in person.

41:19.398 --> 41:23.494
Mom and Dad and the whole countryside
still talk about him.

41:23.602 --> 41:25.832
The world's best doctor.

41:27.407 --> 41:31.104
Let's call the baby after him.

41:31.209 --> 41:34.543
Isak Akerman... not a bad name
for a prime minister.

41:34.646 --> 41:36.615
Suppose it's a girl.

41:36.715 --> 41:39.707
We only have boys.

41:46.092 --> 41:49.084
And how's your father these days?

41:49.195 --> 41:53.153
Oh, Dad's getting a bit decrepit.

41:53.265 --> 41:56.030
But Mom's as lively as a cricket.

41:57.202 --> 41:59.568
<i>And you're going to see
your mother, Doctor?</i>

42:00.706 --> 42:04.608
She's amazing.
She must be at least 95.

42:04.711 --> 42:07.202
- Ninety-six.
- Imagine that.

42:09.381 --> 42:10.974
What do I owe you?

42:11.084 --> 42:14.247
- This is on Eva and me!
- Absolutely not!

42:14.354 --> 42:18.222
Don't insult us, Doctor.
We can do the proper thing too!

42:18.323 --> 42:22.885
Why should you pay
for my gasoline?

42:22.996 --> 42:26.762
<i>There are things
that can't be paid back...</i>

42:26.898 --> 42:28.526
not even with gas.

42:28.633 --> 42:31.102
We haven't forgotten.

42:31.204 --> 42:34.970
Ask anyone around here.

42:35.073 --> 42:38.043
They all remember your kindness.

42:40.113 --> 42:43.343
Maybe I should have stayed here.

42:43.448 --> 42:45.041
What do you mean?

42:48.287 --> 42:51.050
You said you should have stayed.

42:51.157 --> 42:53.352
Did I?

42:53.459 --> 42:56.950
Well, thanks anyway.

42:58.164 --> 43:02.793
Let me know when the new son arrives,
and I'll be the godfather.

43:02.901 --> 43:04.802
You know where to find me.

43:26.025 --> 43:30.927
<i>During lunch I was in good spirits</i>

43:31.030 --> 43:35.490
<i>and told the young people about
my years as district medical officer.</i>

43:35.601 --> 43:38.229
<i>My stories were quite a success,</i>

43:38.336 --> 43:41.602
<i>and I don't think they laughed
merely out of courtesy.</i>

43:42.175 --> 43:46.635
<i>I had wine with the lunch,
and then port with the coffee.</i>

43:50.816 --> 43:56.414
Ah, when creation shows
so much beauty,

43:57.289 --> 44:00.588
how radiant must be its source!

44:00.693 --> 44:02.854
He is going to be a minister,
and Viktor a doctor.

44:02.961 --> 44:05.122
Reciting poetry
is against our agreement

44:05.231 --> 44:09.599
not to discuss God
or science on this trip.

44:09.702 --> 44:10.930
It was beautiful!

44:11.037 --> 44:15.439
How can anyone today
study to become a minister!

44:15.541 --> 44:19.943
Your rationalism is as dry as dust.

44:20.046 --> 44:21.775
I say that modern man...

44:21.881 --> 44:23.644
I say that...

44:23.749 --> 44:28.914
believes only in himself

44:29.021 --> 44:30.648
and his biological death.

44:30.756 --> 44:33.519
Modern man is a figment
of your imagination.

44:33.626 --> 44:37.220
Man regards death with horror.

44:37.329 --> 44:41.595
Religion for the people.
Opium for the aching limb.

44:41.700 --> 44:43.258
<i>How sweet they both are!</i>

44:43.369 --> 44:45.394
I always agree with the one
I spoke with last.

44:45.505 --> 44:48.405
Once you believed in Santa Claus...
now in God.

44:48.508 --> 44:51.965
You never had any imagination!

44:52.077 --> 44:54.568
What do you say, Professor?

44:54.680 --> 45:00.481
Whatever I said
would be met with tolerant irony,

45:00.586 --> 45:02.110
so I'll say nothing.

45:02.220 --> 45:04.121
I'm sure they'll be disappointed.

45:04.222 --> 45:07.919
No, Sara. Very, very happy.

45:09.996 --> 45:13.488
"Where is the friend I seek

45:13.599 --> 45:19.298
at break of day?

45:19.405 --> 45:23.363
When night falls, when..."

45:23.476 --> 45:26.775
"When night falls,
I still have not found Him."

45:26.878 --> 45:30.644
"My burning heart
shows me His traces..."

45:30.749 --> 45:32.684
Are you religious, Professor?

45:34.887 --> 45:38.983
"I see His traces

45:39.090 --> 45:43.858
wherever flowers bloom.

45:49.001 --> 45:54.267
His love is mingled with every air."

45:55.207 --> 45:58.177
"His voice calls
in the summer wind."

45:58.276 --> 46:01.371
Not bad for a love poem.

46:02.280 --> 46:06.546
I've gone all solemn again
for no reason.

46:07.787 --> 46:12.918
Well, I'm going to call on my mother.
I'll be back soon.

46:13.025 --> 46:15.720
- May I come?
- Of course.

46:27.439 --> 46:29.805
Here comes the thunder.

46:36.349 --> 46:40.785
I have just sent you a telegram

46:40.885 --> 46:43.945
on your great day.

46:44.222 --> 46:45.747
And now you're here.

46:45.858 --> 46:49.349
We all have our bright moments,
dear Mother.

46:51.863 --> 46:54.628
Is that your wife over there?

46:54.733 --> 46:57.793
I don't want to talk to her.

46:58.470 --> 47:00.871
She has done us too much harm.

47:00.972 --> 47:03.702
No, Mother dear.

47:03.809 --> 47:08.405
This is Evald's wife, Marianne.

47:08.514 --> 47:11.539
Well, let her come
and say hello to me.

47:13.852 --> 47:15.787
Good day, Mrs. Borg.

47:16.088 --> 47:19.421
And why are you
gadding about like this?

47:19.525 --> 47:21.515
I have been in Stockholm for a visit.

47:21.626 --> 47:25.756
Why aren't you with Evald
and the child?

47:25.865 --> 47:28.765
Evald and I have no children.

47:28.867 --> 47:33.965
These young people nowadays!
I bore ten children.

47:35.640 --> 47:41.409
Will you please hand me
that big box over there.

47:43.448 --> 47:46.349
My mother lived in this house.

47:46.452 --> 47:50.081
Do you remember
coming to see her, Isak?

47:50.189 --> 47:52.053
Very well.

47:52.157 --> 47:56.184
Here are some of your toys.

47:56.294 --> 48:01.197
I have been trying to think
which of you owned what.

48:01.300 --> 48:05.030
Ten children,
and all dead except Isak.

48:05.137 --> 48:07.264
Twenty grandchildren.

48:07.372 --> 48:10.307
Evald's the only one
who comes to see me.

48:10.409 --> 48:13.139
Don't get me wrong...
I'm not complaining.

48:14.012 --> 48:17.244
Fifteen great-grandchildren
whom I have never seen.

48:17.349 --> 48:23.084
I send presents
for all their birthdays.

48:23.189 --> 48:29.025
I get letters of thanks,
but nobody bothers to visit me

48:29.128 --> 48:32.655
unless they want to borrow money.

48:32.764 --> 48:35.927
Oh, I know I'm tiresome.

48:36.035 --> 48:38.559
Don't think that, Mother.

48:38.671 --> 48:40.798
And I've one more fault.

48:41.340 --> 48:43.307
I don't die.

48:43.409 --> 48:47.037
The inheritance
isn't being divided up

48:47.146 --> 48:50.171
the way these crafty young people
had planned.

48:51.349 --> 48:54.751
This was Sigbritt's doll.

48:55.019 --> 48:58.079
She got it when she turned eight.

48:58.256 --> 49:00.918
I made the dress myself.

49:01.026 --> 49:03.392
But she never cared for it

49:03.496 --> 49:05.430
so it went to Charlotta.

49:05.530 --> 49:09.092
She took care of it...
I remember it clearly.

49:10.869 --> 49:12.633
Do you see who that is?

49:12.738 --> 49:16.037
Sigfrid was three
and you were five.

49:16.742 --> 49:20.177
And myself.

49:20.278 --> 49:22.713
What a fright
one looked in those days.

49:23.749 --> 49:25.215
May I have it?

49:25.316 --> 49:27.842
By all means.
It's only rubbish.

49:28.854 --> 49:30.684
And here's a coloring book.

49:30.789 --> 49:36.421
I don't know whose it was.

49:36.528 --> 49:39.088
They've all put their names in it.

49:40.166 --> 49:42.133
Kristina has scrawled:

49:42.233 --> 49:47.193
"I love Papa more than
anything in the whole world."

49:48.441 --> 49:53.468
And Birgitta has put:
"I'm going to marry Papa."

49:54.479 --> 49:58.883
Isn't that funny?
I laughed when I saw it.

49:59.918 --> 50:04.048
Don't you think it's cold in here?

50:04.155 --> 50:06.784
No, not particularly.

50:06.892 --> 50:10.555
I have felt cold all my life.

50:10.662 --> 50:14.121
Mostly my stomach.
I wonder why.

50:14.233 --> 50:17.066
You have low blood pressure.

50:17.168 --> 50:22.037
Let us have some tea,
and we can sit and talk.

50:22.140 --> 50:25.303
No, thank you, Mother.
We won't disturb you any longer.

50:29.514 --> 50:32.483
Sigbritt's eldest boy
will soon be 50.

50:32.584 --> 50:35.678
I thought of giving him
Father's gold watch.

50:35.787 --> 50:39.689
It has no hands.
Does that matter?

50:49.635 --> 50:53.934
I remember when Sigbritt's boy
was a newborn.

50:54.039 --> 50:59.443
He used to lie in the lilac arbor
at the summer house.

50:59.544 --> 51:02.604
Now he's turning 50.

51:03.715 --> 51:09.211
And little cousin Sara used to
carry him around and sing to him.

51:09.320 --> 51:12.084
She married Sigfrid,
that good-for-nothing.

51:13.057 --> 51:18.519
Well, you must go now,
or you'll be late for the ceremony.

51:18.631 --> 51:23.693
I am very glad you came,
and I hope to see you again.

51:23.802 --> 51:27.293
Give my love to Evald.
Good-bye.

51:53.999 --> 51:56.398
Where are Anders and Viktor?

51:56.501 --> 52:02.133
They started arguing about God,
and then they lost their tempers.

52:02.575 --> 52:05.702
And Anders tried
to twist Viktor's arm,

52:05.811 --> 52:09.747
and Viktor said that was
a lousy argument for God's existence.

52:09.847 --> 52:13.477
I said they could talk
about me instead.

52:13.586 --> 52:18.285
Then they told me to shut up
because I didn't understand the debate,

52:18.389 --> 52:19.856
so I left.

52:19.959 --> 52:24.088
They went up the hill to fight it out
because each insisted...

52:24.195 --> 52:27.131
the other had hurt
his innermost feelings.

52:27.231 --> 52:29.461
- Where are they now?
- Up there.

52:33.572 --> 52:35.198
I'll see to them.

52:35.307 --> 52:37.740
<i>Which one do you like best?</i>

52:38.110 --> 52:40.340
Which one do you like best?

52:40.445 --> 52:43.813
I don't know.
Anders is going to be a minister...

52:43.916 --> 52:45.941
He's a darling.

52:46.885 --> 52:48.910
But a minister's wife...

52:49.021 --> 52:51.990
Viktor's nice too.
In a different way.

52:52.090 --> 52:55.526
- Viktor will go far, of course.
- What do you mean?

52:55.628 --> 53:00.860
A doctor earns more money.
And ministers are out of date.

53:00.965 --> 53:04.662
Though he has got nice legs
and a sweet neck.

53:05.903 --> 53:07.838
<i>But how can anyone believe in God?</i>

53:21.486 --> 53:24.081
Well? Does God exist?

53:47.780 --> 53:53.218
<i>I dozed off,
but was haunted by vivid</i>

53:53.318 --> 53:58.914
<i>and humiliating dreams.</i>

53:59.858 --> 54:06.195
<i>There was something overpowering
in these dream images</i>

54:06.298 --> 54:12.236
<i>that bored relentlessly into my mind.</i>

54:22.947 --> 54:24.939
Have you looked in the mirror, Isak?

54:28.086 --> 54:30.077
Then I'll show you
what you look like.

54:32.090 --> 54:35.389
You're a worried old man
who's soon going to die,

54:35.494 --> 54:38.189
but I have all my life before me.

54:39.764 --> 54:42.198
That hurt your feelings, after all.

54:43.135 --> 54:46.400
No, it didn't hurt.

54:46.505 --> 54:51.602
Yes, it hurt
because you can't bear the truth.

54:52.644 --> 54:56.171
The truth is that
I've been too considerate.

54:56.782 --> 54:58.943
And so became unintentionally cruel.

55:02.086 --> 55:03.178
I understand.

55:03.287 --> 55:08.224
No, you don't understand.
We don't speak the same language.

55:09.461 --> 55:11.189
Look in the mirror again.

55:11.296 --> 55:13.320
No, don't turn away.

55:13.932 --> 55:15.490
I see.

55:16.101 --> 55:17.762
Listen to me.

55:18.970 --> 55:22.202
I'm going to marry
your brother Sigfrid.

55:23.041 --> 55:27.171
Love is almost a game for us.

55:28.881 --> 55:33.318
Look at your face now.
Try to smile!

55:34.986 --> 55:37.581
There! Now you're smiling.

55:39.691 --> 55:41.715
But it hurts so.

55:42.227 --> 55:47.164
As professor emeritus,
you ought to know why it hurts.

55:47.265 --> 55:48.823
But you don't know.

55:49.968 --> 55:53.903
You know so much,
and you don't know anything.

55:55.874 --> 55:57.501
I must go.

55:57.608 --> 56:01.135
I promised to keep an eye
on Sigbritt's baby.

56:29.874 --> 56:32.104
Poor little thing.

56:32.811 --> 56:35.575
Hush, baby. Sleep.

56:36.849 --> 56:38.646
Don't be afraid of the wind

56:39.718 --> 56:44.552
or the birds

56:45.423 --> 56:48.358
or the waves of the sea.

56:49.061 --> 56:52.394
I'm here with you,
holding you tight.

56:52.497 --> 56:55.021
Don't be afraid, little one.

56:56.401 --> 56:58.561
It will soon be day again.

56:59.604 --> 57:01.572
No one will hurt you.

57:01.673 --> 57:04.836
I am with you.
I am holding you.

01:00:12.898 --> 01:00:14.990
Please come in, Professor Borg.

01:01:33.311 --> 01:01:35.336
Have you brought
your examination book?

01:01:42.854 --> 01:01:46.483
Please identify the bacterial specimen
under the microscope.

01:01:57.936 --> 01:01:59.994
There must be something wrong.

01:02:04.242 --> 01:02:05.731
Not with the microscope.

01:02:05.843 --> 01:02:09.142
I can't see a thing.

01:02:10.182 --> 01:02:12.912
Please read this text.

01:02:27.831 --> 01:02:29.264
What does it mean?

01:02:31.001 --> 01:02:32.764
I don't know.

01:02:34.405 --> 01:02:35.497
Really?

01:02:35.606 --> 01:02:39.407
I'm a doctor, not a linguist.

01:02:40.477 --> 01:02:46.211
What you see on the blackboard
is a doctor's first duty.

01:02:47.352 --> 01:02:50.253
Don't you know what that is?

01:02:53.057 --> 01:02:54.854
Let me think.

01:02:54.959 --> 01:02:56.586
Take your time.

01:02:58.597 --> 01:03:02.727
A doctor's first duty...

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.930
A doctor's...

01:03:06.604 --> 01:03:08.037
I've forgotten.

01:03:08.139 --> 01:03:12.371
A doctor's first duty
is to ask for forgiveness.

01:03:13.077 --> 01:03:17.481
Of course! Now I remember!

01:03:29.193 --> 01:03:31.856
You have been accused of guilt.

01:03:35.032 --> 01:03:38.298
I'll make a note that you haven't
understood the charge.

01:03:41.472 --> 01:03:43.441
Is it serious?

01:03:44.175 --> 01:03:45.836
Unfortunately, Professor.

01:03:57.856 --> 01:03:59.517
I have a weak heart.

01:03:59.624 --> 01:04:01.887
I'm an old man.

01:04:01.992 --> 01:04:04.825
You must be lenient with me.
It's only fair.

01:04:05.262 --> 01:04:07.992
There's nothing about your heart
in my papers.

01:04:08.599 --> 01:04:09.999
Do you want to stop the examination?

01:04:10.101 --> 01:04:12.126
No, for God's sake, no!

01:04:19.644 --> 01:04:22.874
Please diagnose the patient.

01:04:36.727 --> 01:04:39.356
The patient is dead.

01:05:01.619 --> 01:05:03.814
What are you writing in my book?

01:05:03.921 --> 01:05:06.981
- My verdict.
- And that is?

01:05:07.425 --> 01:05:09.358
That you are incompetent.

01:05:12.764 --> 01:05:18.099
You are also accused of some minor
but still serious offenses.

01:05:18.736 --> 01:05:23.173
Callousness, selfishness,
ruthlessness.

01:05:24.008 --> 01:05:26.977
Your wife has made the charge.

01:05:27.077 --> 01:05:29.410
You'll be confronted with her.

01:05:29.514 --> 01:05:32.005
But my wife has been dead for years!

01:05:32.117 --> 01:05:33.981
Do you think I'm joking?

01:05:36.553 --> 01:05:38.715
Please come with me.

01:05:39.224 --> 01:05:41.316
You have no choice.

01:08:01.932 --> 01:08:04.925
Many forget a woman
who has been dead for 30 years.

01:08:05.602 --> 01:08:08.697
Some cherish
a sweet and fading picture,

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:14.805
but you can recall this scene
at any time.

01:08:15.646 --> 01:08:18.343
Tuesday, May 1 st, 1917.

01:08:19.617 --> 01:08:21.277
You stood on this very spot.

01:08:21.385 --> 01:08:25.822
And heard and saw what that man
and woman said and did.

01:08:40.837 --> 01:08:45.274
Now I'll go home and tell Isak.
I know just what he'll say.

01:08:45.375 --> 01:08:48.709
"My poor girl, I'm sorry for you."

01:08:50.581 --> 01:08:52.947
Just as if he were God.

01:08:54.585 --> 01:08:59.818
Then I'll weep and say,
"Do you really feel sorry for me?"

01:09:01.058 --> 01:09:05.495
He'll say, "Yes, very sorry."

01:09:06.096 --> 01:09:10.124
Then I'll weep even more
and ask him to forgive me.

01:09:10.233 --> 01:09:11.428
He'll say,

01:09:11.536 --> 01:09:16.837
"You mustn't beg my forgiveness.
There is nothing to forgive."

01:09:19.611 --> 01:09:22.340
But he doesn't mean
a word he says

01:09:24.314 --> 01:09:26.578
because he's cold as ice.

01:09:28.486 --> 01:09:31.182
And suddenly he gets very tender,

01:09:32.723 --> 01:09:35.214
and I scream at him that he's mad

01:09:36.995 --> 01:09:40.259
and that his hypocrisy makes me sick.

01:09:41.299 --> 01:09:44.325
Then he says
he'll get me a sedative

01:09:44.434 --> 01:09:47.631
and that he understands
everything quite well.

01:09:48.839 --> 01:09:51.000
And I tell him it's his fault
that I am as I am.

01:09:53.443 --> 01:09:57.573
<i>And he looks sad
and says it is his fault.</i>

01:09:59.483 --> 01:10:01.781
But he doesn't really care
about anything

01:10:02.452 --> 01:10:04.420
because he's so cold.

01:10:28.412 --> 01:10:29.879
Where is she?

01:10:29.981 --> 01:10:34.441
Gone. All are gone.

01:10:34.552 --> 01:10:38.487
Removed by an operation,
Professor.

01:10:39.122 --> 01:10:42.751
A surgical masterpiece.
No pain.

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:44.794
Nothing that bleeds or trembles.

01:10:45.696 --> 01:10:47.857
How silent it is.

01:10:48.866 --> 01:10:51.357
A perfect achievement
in its way, Professor.

01:10:52.402 --> 01:10:54.200
And the punishment?

01:10:54.304 --> 01:10:57.968
I don't know.
The usual, I suppose.

01:10:58.076 --> 01:10:59.634
The usual?

01:10:59.744 --> 01:11:01.643
Loneliness.

01:11:01.745 --> 01:11:04.044
Loneliness?

01:11:04.147 --> 01:11:06.981
Precisely.

01:11:07.719 --> 01:11:09.812
Is there no mercy?

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.287
Don't ask me. I don't know.

01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:35.240
What's this?

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:38.946
The children wanted
to stretch their legs.

01:11:39.049 --> 01:11:41.745
But it's still raining.

01:11:41.853 --> 01:11:46.517
I told them about today
and they want to honor you.

01:11:47.991 --> 01:11:49.015
Slept well?

01:11:49.126 --> 01:11:54.894
Yes, but recently I've had
the weirdest dreams,

01:11:59.737 --> 01:12:04.071
as if I must tell myself something
I won't listen to when I'm awake.

01:12:04.174 --> 01:12:05.505
What's that?

01:12:06.878 --> 01:12:10.005
That I'm dead.
Although I'm alive.

01:12:10.881 --> 01:12:13.372
You and Evald are very alike.

01:12:14.251 --> 01:12:15.912
So you've said.

01:12:16.019 --> 01:12:18.250
He said the same thing.

01:12:18.688 --> 01:12:20.714
About me?

01:12:20.825 --> 01:12:22.554
No. About himself.

01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:24.126
But he's only 38.

01:12:26.731 --> 01:12:29.222
May I tell you about it?

01:12:29.332 --> 01:12:33.268
Yes, I'd be grateful.

01:12:34.839 --> 01:12:39.207
A few months ago
I wanted to talk to Evald,

01:12:39.309 --> 01:12:41.402
so he drove me down to the sea.

01:12:41.512 --> 01:12:45.572
It was raining then too.
He sat where you sit now.

01:12:47.852 --> 01:12:52.220
Well, you've trapped me.
What do you want to say?

01:12:52.322 --> 01:12:54.553
Something unpleasant, of course.

01:12:55.927 --> 01:12:57.986
I wish I didn't have to.

01:12:58.094 --> 01:13:00.153
You have found someone else.

01:13:01.064 --> 01:13:02.896
Don't be childish.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.595
You tell me in funereal tones
that you must talk to me,

01:13:07.705 --> 01:13:11.436
and then you find it
hard to begin.

01:13:11.541 --> 01:13:17.481
Come on, for heaven's sake!
Don't keep me on tenterhooks!

01:13:17.581 --> 01:13:19.412
I almost want to laugh now.

01:13:19.517 --> 01:13:21.416
Whatever do you think
I'm going to tell you?

01:13:21.518 --> 01:13:25.717
That I've killed someone,
or stolen the faculty funds?

01:13:25.822 --> 01:13:27.450
I'm going to have a baby.

01:13:30.327 --> 01:13:31.852
Are you sure?

01:13:31.963 --> 01:13:34.362
The doctor told me yesterday.

01:13:34.464 --> 01:13:38.834
So that was the secret.

01:13:39.836 --> 01:13:44.137
I might as well tell you
that I intend to have this child.

01:13:45.343 --> 01:13:47.970
- You've made up your mind?
- Yes, I have.

01:14:04.461 --> 01:14:06.521
You know I don't want a child.

01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:09.064
You'll have to choose
between me and the child.

01:14:09.165 --> 01:14:12.226
- Poor Evald.
- Don't "poor Evald" me!

01:14:13.036 --> 01:14:16.528
It's absurd to bring children
into this world

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:19.508
and think they'll be better off
than we are.

01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:23.478
- That's just an excuse.
- Call it what you want.

01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:27.880
I was an unwanted child
in a hellish marriage.

01:14:27.985 --> 01:14:30.852
Is he even sure I'm his son?

01:14:30.955 --> 01:14:34.617
That's no excuse
for behaving like this.

01:14:34.724 --> 01:14:36.249
I must be at the hospital at 3:00.

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:39.329
I have neither the time nor the desire
to discuss this any further.

01:14:41.398 --> 01:14:43.299
You're a coward.

01:14:43.867 --> 01:14:45.335
Yes.

01:14:45.702 --> 01:14:47.830
This life sickens me.

01:14:47.938 --> 01:14:49.599
I will not be forced to take on

01:14:49.706 --> 01:14:52.540
a responsibility that will make me live
for one day longer than I want to.

01:14:52.643 --> 01:14:57.512
And you know
that I mean what I say.

01:15:09.927 --> 01:15:11.758
I know that this is wrong.

01:15:11.862 --> 01:15:14.193
There's neither right nor wrong.

01:15:14.298 --> 01:15:18.428
We act according to our needs.

01:15:18.536 --> 01:15:19.798
And what are they?

01:15:20.537 --> 01:15:25.031
Yours is a hellish desire
to live and to create life.

01:15:25.142 --> 01:15:26.268
And yours?

01:15:27.411 --> 01:15:31.403
Mine is to be dead.
Stone-dead.

01:15:44.295 --> 01:15:48.061
If you want to smoke a cigarette,
I don't mind.

01:15:52.402 --> 01:15:55.201
Why have you told me all this?

01:15:57.674 --> 01:16:03.613
I saw you with your mother,
and I was panic-stricken.

01:16:05.116 --> 01:16:06.777
I don't understand.

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:13.653
I thought: That's his mother.

01:16:14.457 --> 01:16:19.521
An old woman, cold as ice,

01:16:19.629 --> 01:16:22.656
more forbidding than death.

01:16:23.933 --> 01:16:26.164
And this is her son,

01:16:26.704 --> 01:16:29.901
and there are light-years
between them.

01:16:30.907 --> 01:16:33.570
He himself says
he's a living corpse.

01:16:35.679 --> 01:16:41.082
And Evald is growing
just as lonely, cold and dead.

01:16:42.786 --> 01:16:45.755
And I thought of the baby inside me.

01:16:46.756 --> 01:16:51.022
All along the line,
there's nothing but cold and death

01:16:51.128 --> 01:16:54.097
and loneliness.

01:16:54.999 --> 01:16:57.330
It must end somewhere.

01:16:58.501 --> 01:17:01.027
But you're going back to Evald!

01:17:02.807 --> 01:17:05.866
To say I can't agree
to his conditions.

01:17:05.976 --> 01:17:09.969
I want this child.
No one can take it from me.

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:12.514
Not even the man
I love most of all.

01:17:15.986 --> 01:17:18.010
Can I help you?

01:17:18.121 --> 01:17:19.589
No one can help me.

01:17:21.192 --> 01:17:24.251
We are too old.
Things have gone too far.

01:17:25.196 --> 01:17:28.028
What happened after your talk?

01:17:28.131 --> 01:17:30.599
Nothing.
I left him the next day.

01:17:31.134 --> 01:17:33.228
Hasn't he gotten in touch with you?

01:17:35.171 --> 01:17:39.905
- I don't want us to get...
- To get what?

01:17:41.679 --> 01:17:44.272
Like those two in the car today.

01:17:46.049 --> 01:17:48.678
I was just thinking of them.

01:17:49.219 --> 01:17:52.711
It reminded me of my own marriage.

01:17:53.456 --> 01:17:55.287
But we love each other.

01:17:55.392 --> 01:17:57.860
<i>Long may he live
Long may he live</i>

01:17:57.961 --> 01:18:00.795
<i>May he live to be
a hundred years old</i>

01:18:03.099 --> 01:18:06.000
We heard you're celebrating
a grand occasion today.

01:18:06.103 --> 01:18:10.300
With these simple flowers
we want to say

01:18:10.406 --> 01:18:14.969
<i>that we are very impressed
that you've been a doctor for 50 years.</i>

01:18:15.079 --> 01:18:18.879
We know you must be
a very wise old man

01:18:19.683 --> 01:18:22.379
<i>who knows everything about life</i>

01:18:22.486 --> 01:18:26.923
and has learned
all the instructions by heart.

01:18:29.226 --> 01:18:31.660
Thank you.

01:18:32.929 --> 01:18:36.093
Now we must go on.
It's getting late.

01:19:05.196 --> 01:19:09.656
So you did come.
Evald and I had given up hope.

01:19:09.933 --> 01:19:12.697
A nice drive is relaxing, isn't it?

01:19:13.536 --> 01:19:16.505
You'll have to get
into your tails at once.

01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:21.170
Good afternoon, Marianne.
I've told Evald you're coming.

01:19:21.277 --> 01:19:23.745
Thank you.
That was most kind.

01:19:24.781 --> 01:19:26.647
So you came after all, Miss Agda.

01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:31.847
I considered it my duty.
But my pleasure's been spoiled.

01:19:33.156 --> 01:19:34.714
Welcome, Father.

01:19:35.992 --> 01:19:38.018
As you see,
I've brought Marianne with me.

01:19:38.128 --> 01:19:40.857
- Hello, Marianne.
- May I put my things upstairs?

01:19:40.964 --> 01:19:43.956
The guest room as usual, Father?

01:19:44.067 --> 01:19:46.433
Let me take your bag.
It's rather heavy.

01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:53.207
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yes, it was pleasant.

01:19:53.309 --> 01:19:54.537
Who are those young people?

01:19:54.644 --> 01:19:56.839
I don't know. They're nice,
and they're off to Italy.

01:19:56.946 --> 01:19:59.915
- They seem nice.
- Yes, they're very nice.

01:20:00.017 --> 01:20:02.713
It's a quarter past 4:00.

01:20:07.825 --> 01:20:09.816
I've bought you new shoelaces.

01:20:18.768 --> 01:20:21.134
I'm leaving tomorrow,
so don't worry.

01:20:21.237 --> 01:20:23.638
- Are you going to a hotel?
- No, why?

01:20:23.741 --> 01:20:27.472
Can't we share the bedroom
for one more night? Unless you object.

01:20:27.577 --> 01:20:30.546
- Give me a hand unpacking?
- It's nice to see you.

01:20:30.714 --> 01:20:32.613
And unexpected.

01:20:32.715 --> 01:20:34.411
Same here.

01:20:34.518 --> 01:20:37.351
Are we going on
to the banquet afterwards?

01:20:37.454 --> 01:20:41.982
Yes, I'll just call Stenberg
and tell him I'll have a lady with me.

01:20:49.633 --> 01:20:51.759
Hurry up, Professor!

01:22:26.696 --> 01:22:31.634
<i>During the ceremony,</i>

01:22:31.735 --> 01:22:35.670
<i>my thoughts strayed
to the day's events,</i>

01:22:36.473 --> 01:22:40.670
<i>and it was then I decided</i>

01:22:40.777 --> 01:22:43.576
<i>to write down what had happened.</i>

01:22:44.046 --> 01:22:49.951
<i>In this jumble of events,</i>

01:22:50.053 --> 01:22:54.250
<i>I seemed to discern
an extraordinary logic.</i>

01:23:19.916 --> 01:23:22.885
Did you enjoy the ceremony?

01:23:22.986 --> 01:23:24.714
Yes, thank you.

01:23:26.589 --> 01:23:28.113
Are you tired, Miss Agda?

01:23:28.224 --> 01:23:29.817
I won't deny it.

01:23:29.927 --> 01:23:31.951
Take one of my sleeping pills.

01:23:34.798 --> 01:23:39.701
Miss Agda, I am sorry
about this morning.

01:23:40.237 --> 01:23:42.170
Are you ill, Professor?

01:23:42.272 --> 01:23:44.205
No. Why?

01:23:44.308 --> 01:23:47.744
I don't like the sound of it.

01:23:48.378 --> 01:23:50.710
Is it so rare
for me to say I'm sorry?

01:23:53.416 --> 01:23:55.749
Do you want the carafe
on the table?

01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:23.812
Thank you anyway, Professor.
Good night.

01:24:24.414 --> 01:24:26.143
Miss Agda,

01:24:28.151 --> 01:24:32.451
as we have known each other

01:24:32.555 --> 01:24:34.683
for so many years,

01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:38.282
don't you think we could call
each other Agda and Isak?

01:24:38.394 --> 01:24:41.057
No, I don't.

01:24:41.164 --> 01:24:42.460
Why not?

01:24:43.232 --> 01:24:45.063
Have you brushed your teeth,
Professor?

01:24:46.937 --> 01:24:51.032
No intimacies for me, thank you.

01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:53.302
It's all right between us as it is.

01:24:53.410 --> 01:24:56.344
But we are old now.

01:24:56.446 --> 01:25:01.213
Speak for yourself.
A woman is jealous of her reputation.

01:25:01.919 --> 01:25:06.151
What would people think if we
suddenly began to say Agda and Isak?

01:25:06.255 --> 01:25:08.189
They would make fun of us.

01:25:08.291 --> 01:25:11.692
Are you always right?

01:25:11.795 --> 01:25:13.853
Almost always.

01:25:13.964 --> 01:25:18.957
At our age,
we should know how to behave.

01:25:26.108 --> 01:25:30.442
Good night, Professor.
I'll leave the door ajar.

01:25:30.546 --> 01:25:34.573
You know where I am
if you want anything.

01:26:20.229 --> 01:26:23.893
Father Isak! You were splendid
in the procession.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.969
We were terribly proud
to know you.

01:26:26.068 --> 01:26:30.027
An old girl is giving us a lift
all the way to Hamburg.

01:26:30.139 --> 01:26:33.040
- Anders is mad about her.
- Oh, be quiet.

01:26:33.143 --> 01:26:34.939
We just wanted to say good-bye.

01:26:35.045 --> 01:26:37.478
Good-bye. And thank you
for your company.

01:26:39.816 --> 01:26:42.113
It's you I really love, you know.

01:26:42.219 --> 01:26:46.245
Today, tomorrow, always.

01:26:46.756 --> 01:26:48.621
I'll remember.

01:26:49.058 --> 01:26:51.754
Come on.

01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:00.965
We have to go now.

01:27:04.573 --> 01:27:06.701
Let me hear from you.

01:27:18.821 --> 01:27:21.312
- I think Uncle is asleep.
- Evald!

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.421
Yes, Father?

01:27:24.527 --> 01:27:26.155
Are you back already?

01:27:27.496 --> 01:27:29.964
Marianne lost the heel on a shoe.

01:27:31.902 --> 01:27:34.062
So you're going to the dance?

01:27:35.237 --> 01:27:37.171
I suppose so.

01:27:38.308 --> 01:27:41.367
- How are you, Father?
- Excellent.

01:27:41.478 --> 01:27:44.207
- Heart all right?
- Excellent.

01:27:45.982 --> 01:27:48.040
Sleep well.

01:27:50.253 --> 01:27:53.245
Sit down a moment.

01:27:54.957 --> 01:27:56.857
Anything special?

01:27:58.161 --> 01:28:03.496
How is it to be
between you and Marianne?

01:28:04.968 --> 01:28:06.594
Forgive my asking.

01:28:06.702 --> 01:28:08.192
I don't know.

01:28:09.039 --> 01:28:11.803
It's not my business, but...

01:28:13.809 --> 01:28:16.335
But wouldn't it...

01:28:16.446 --> 01:28:18.470
I have asked her to stay with me.

01:28:18.581 --> 01:28:20.777
Shouldn't you... I mean...

01:28:20.884 --> 01:28:25.150
- I can't live without her.
- You mean alone?

01:28:25.254 --> 01:28:28.314
<i>I can't live without her.
That's what I mean.</i>

01:28:28.424 --> 01:28:30.393
Oh, I see.

01:28:30.494 --> 01:28:32.223
It will be as she wants.

01:28:32.661 --> 01:28:35.323
And she...

01:28:35.965 --> 01:28:39.129
She says she'll think about it.

01:28:40.036 --> 01:28:41.969
About that debt of yours...

01:28:42.071 --> 01:28:44.302
Don't worry,
you'll get your money.

01:28:44.406 --> 01:28:47.000
That's not what I meant.

01:28:49.478 --> 01:28:50.844
How are you, Uncle Isak?

01:28:50.946 --> 01:28:52.880
Fine. Just fine.

01:28:52.982 --> 01:28:55.974
I lost a heel.
Will these shoes do?

01:28:56.085 --> 01:28:58.554
They're very nice.

01:29:01.491 --> 01:29:03.584
Thanks for coming with me.

01:29:06.929 --> 01:29:09.830
I like you, Marianne.

01:29:10.467 --> 01:29:12.764
I like you too, Uncle Isak.

01:29:21.244 --> 01:29:25.407
<i>If I have been worried
or sad during the day,</i>

01:29:25.915 --> 01:29:31.478
<i>it often calms me
to recall childhood memories.</i>

01:29:32.488 --> 01:29:34.854
<i>I did so on this evening too.</i>

01:29:46.736 --> 01:29:50.103
Isak, there are no
wild strawberries left.

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:53.071
Auntie wants you
to look for your papa.

01:29:53.175 --> 01:29:55.871
We'll sail around and meet you
at the other side of the island.

01:29:56.312 --> 01:30:00.682
I can't find either Papa or Mama.

01:30:01.284 --> 01:30:03.878
Come, I'll help you.
