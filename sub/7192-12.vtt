00:00.792 --> 00:01.751
- She's beautiful.

00:01.835 --> 00:03.753
Looks just like you.

00:03.836 --> 00:04.754
EMMA:
It's nice to have.

00:04.838 --> 00:06.381
It helps keep
her memory alive.

00:06.464 --> 00:07.424
- If only we could
turn back time, right?

00:07.507 --> 00:09.384
- Hmm.

00:11.678 --> 00:12.679
- What if I can?

00:12.762 --> 00:14.514
- What was that, Em?

00:14.597 --> 00:15.765
- What?

00:15.849 --> 00:16.099
Oh, nothing.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.603
- I don't mean
to be so forward,

00:20.687 --> 00:23.273
but you wouldn't happen to have
any pictures of Jax, would you?

00:23.356 --> 00:24.941
- Mom, come on.

00:25.024 --> 00:26.776
- Hey, we've got years of
catching up

00:26.860 --> 00:28.069
on me embarrassing you.

00:28.153 --> 00:30.113
It's just that
I've missed you so much.

00:30.196 --> 00:31.531
I thought it would be
really nice to see how

00:31.614 --> 00:32.281
you've been living
your life.

00:32.365 --> 00:34.117
- Now that you mention it,

00:34.200 --> 00:35.535
I may have some stuff
you might be interested in.

00:38.246 --> 00:40.290
- Hold on to
that one, Jax.

00:40.373 --> 00:41.458
She's a terrific girl.

00:41.541 --> 00:42.125
- She is, isn't she?
- Mm-hmm.

00:53.261 --> 00:54.804
- Hey.
- [gasps]

00:54.888 --> 00:56.306
- You okay in here?

00:56.389 --> 00:57.807
- What if it's
possible, Jax?

00:57.891 --> 00:59.309
- What if what's
possible?

00:59.392 --> 01:00.685
- To turn back time.

01:00.769 --> 01:03.646
- Em...
You can't do that.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.482
The past is the past,
and you can't change that.

01:05.565 --> 01:08.943
- But what if we didn't need to
accept the past for what it is?

01:09.027 --> 01:10.779
What if we had
another chance?

01:10.862 --> 01:12.322
A do-over?

01:12.405 --> 01:14.324
- I'm not exactly sure what
you're talking about here, Em.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.618
- I'm talking about
going back in time

01:16.701 --> 01:18.995
and altering
the universe...

01:19.078 --> 01:19.162

You ready to do this?

02:17.595 --> 02:18.638
- Come again?

02:18.721 --> 02:20.139
- I said, are you
ready to do this?

02:20.223 --> 02:21.641
- I think so.

02:21.724 --> 02:23.309
- You're totally sure
it's safe, right?

02:23.393 --> 02:25.144
- Look, I'll just go inside
and just wait for me here

02:25.228 --> 02:27.730
until I give you
the word.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.149
- I'm sorry, I'm just

02:33.111 --> 02:34.362
The Council doesn't
technically know

02:34.445 --> 02:36.281
the meeting's
about you...

02:36.364 --> 02:36.698
or that
you're coming.

02:36.781 --> 02:39.409
- Andi!

02:39.492 --> 02:40.493
- Here, hold this.

02:45.498 --> 02:46.457
Much better.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.881
- This is after last year's win
at the first round of counties.

02:54.799 --> 02:55.717
- Wait.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.761
Wow, Emma,
you look really edgy.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.097
- I think we were supposed
to be doing edgy faces.

03:01.180 --> 03:02.265
- You look intense.

03:02.348 --> 03:03.766
There's a darkness
behind those eyes.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.101
- Darkness? What?

03:05.184 --> 03:06.394
- Your eye shadow, it's...

03:06.477 --> 03:07.645
much darker than what
you've got on now.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.606
- Oh, my eye shadow.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.858
Sure.
I was doing a whole...

03:11.941 --> 03:14.027
- Biker thing.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.863
- Exactly...
Biker, yep.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.783
- Thank you, Emma, for sharing
these memories with me.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.410
But I really
should be going,

03:22.493 --> 03:25.663
it isn't safe for me to stay
in one place for so long.

03:25.747 --> 03:26.998
You'll take me
to the Van Pelts', Jax?

03:27.081 --> 03:30.293
- You know I would,
but I'd be late for school.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.003
- Oh, well, I can
write you a note, honey.

03:32.086 --> 03:33.796
Perks of having your
mom around.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.298
- Why are you going
to the Van Pelts'?

03:35.381 --> 03:37.175
Oh, it's by far and away
the safest place

03:37.258 --> 03:38.009
for me
to be in Miami...

03:38.092 --> 03:41.304
Other than here,
of course.

03:41.387 --> 03:42.388
- Let me go
get my things.

03:54.525 --> 03:55.818
- Hey.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.196
- Where's Captain Creepy Pants
and Sorceress Sunshine?

03:58.279 --> 03:59.864
They're never late.

03:59.948 --> 04:05.119
- How dare you call Desdemona
Captain Creepy Pants?

04:05.203 --> 04:06.204
- She was talking
about you.

04:06.287 --> 04:08.414
- And I think
I proved my point.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.666
- Can we get on with this?

04:09.749 --> 04:14.212
Not only is this impromptu
confab highly irregular,

04:14.295 --> 04:19.007
but it's interrupting
my Alpine yodeling session.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.385
- What can we
do for you, Andi?

04:20.468 --> 04:21.427
- It's about Emma.

04:21.511 --> 04:22.637
- Oh, of course.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.139
What has the little
she-wolf done now?

04:25.223 --> 04:27.892
She hasn't done
anything... new.

04:27.976 --> 04:28.851
It's what she's
already done.

04:33.648 --> 04:34.899
- Why is this human,

04:34.983 --> 04:36.609
who has no business being
before the Council,

04:36.693 --> 04:39.278
standing in front of
the Council?

04:39.362 --> 04:42.031
- Aw... hey, little guy.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.074
What's his name?

04:43.157 --> 04:44.784
- [stammering]

04:44.867 --> 04:49.831
This is an unconscionable waste
of Council time and resources.

04:49.914 --> 04:50.707
Come, Desdemona.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.418
- Wait, please,
let me explain.

04:53.501 --> 04:55.044
I'll yodel it
if I have to.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.754
- Don't insult
our intelligence.

04:56.838 --> 04:57.755
We're leaving.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.550
- Oh...
On the other hand,

05:00.633 --> 05:01.384
perhaps we should hear
the boy out.

05:05.638 --> 05:05.930
[knocking]

05:06.014 --> 05:08.182
- Liana!

05:08.266 --> 05:10.184
You decided to...

05:10.268 --> 05:11.477
bring him.

05:11.561 --> 05:12.979
- Can I come in?

05:13.062 --> 05:14.856
- Have a seat.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.441
So, what's new?

05:16.524 --> 05:17.734
[gasping]

05:17.817 --> 05:20.403
Did I tell you I ran into
your hubby yesterday?

05:20.486 --> 05:21.738
Lovely man.

05:21.821 --> 05:24.240
He tried to make my
daughter disappear.

05:24.323 --> 05:25.908
- Oh...

05:25.992 --> 05:27.160
- Who'd like some tea?

05:27.243 --> 05:29.662
- My husband's actually
why I'm here.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.373
I was hoping while I'm
in Miami I could stay here,

05:32.457 --> 05:33.583
under your protection?

05:33.666 --> 05:35.126
- I think somebody
owes me an apology.

05:35.209 --> 05:37.754
- Oh, you're right.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.422
I'm so sorry I dragged
you into this

05:39.505 --> 05:41.090
and put your daughter
in danger, it was--

05:41.174 --> 05:42.717
- Not you!

05:42.800 --> 05:43.843
Him.

05:43.926 --> 05:45.428
- Me?

05:45.511 --> 05:47.847
- You threatened to turn me
into an ice sculpture.

05:47.930 --> 05:50.725
- But for the record, you would
make a beautiful sculpture.

05:50.808 --> 05:53.811
- Oh, that is so sweet
of you to say.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.271
Thank you.

05:55.354 --> 05:56.731
Now, out with it!

05:56.814 --> 05:57.732
- No!

05:57.815 --> 05:59.400
No way!

05:59.484 --> 06:01.110
I've nothing
to be sorry for.

06:02.945 --> 06:05.073
- It's like I'm trapped in an
elevator between two floors.

06:05.156 --> 06:07.533
I'm connected to this life,

06:07.617 --> 06:12.205
but I also miss Mia and
the animals... sanctuary.

06:12.288 --> 06:13.998
I'd give anything
if I could hear

06:14.082 --> 06:15.958
the sounds of
the Glades one more time.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.293
- Hmm...

06:17.376 --> 06:18.836
Okay.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.838
Now do it
in yodel form.

06:20.922 --> 06:25.134
- [yodeling]

06:25.218 --> 06:26.260
- All right, enough!

06:26.344 --> 06:29.806
Not only have you
wasted my time,

06:29.889 --> 06:31.849
but you've also
offended myself...

06:31.933 --> 06:34.644
and this Alpine goat.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.229
- That's a ram--
a male sheep.

06:36.312 --> 06:37.021
It's a common misconception
because of the horns,

06:37.105 --> 06:39.982
you see, their...

06:40.066 --> 06:41.317
You were saying?

06:41.400 --> 06:44.821
- Even if we cared to place you
back in your old life,

06:44.904 --> 06:46.864
we couldn't.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.492
What happened to you
is a temporal anomaly.

06:49.575 --> 06:51.160
- The fault of
the Chosen One.

06:51.244 --> 06:55.039
Changing what happened in the
past is simply not possible.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.458
- Maybe for you.

06:57.542 --> 06:58.835
The real question is,

06:58.918 --> 07:02.463
is it possible for someone with
the type of power I have?

07:07.051 --> 07:07.885
- [sighing]

07:07.969 --> 07:09.137
I'm sorry.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.972
- A little bit louder.

07:11.055 --> 07:12.473
- Sor-ry.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.058
- Just a little bit louder.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.101
- [groans]

07:15.184 --> 07:16.102
Sorry!

07:16.185 --> 07:17.103
- One more time.

07:17.186 --> 07:17.562
[gasps]
Wait, wait!

07:21.232 --> 07:22.316
- I'm sorry!

07:22.400 --> 07:23.317
- Yes!

07:23.401 --> 07:25.736
MADDIE:
What is going on in here?

07:25.820 --> 07:28.281
Do you know what stress
does to your skin?

07:28.364 --> 07:30.825
I mean, look at
my poor mother.

07:30.908 --> 07:32.618
I had a very stressful
evening last night

07:32.702 --> 07:35.788
and I'm trying to
get some beauty rest.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.415
- Maddie-winky,

07:37.498 --> 07:39.792
uh, Liana is going to be staying
with us for a little while.

07:39.876 --> 07:42.170
- Finally!

07:42.253 --> 07:43.754
You'll have another oldie
to Jazzercise with.

07:43.838 --> 07:47.925
- And, uh, Jax is also
gonna be staying with us.

07:48.009 --> 07:50.511
Now, who'd
like some tea?

07:50.595 --> 07:53.431
- You--you can't
be serious.

07:53.514 --> 07:56.225
- Would you like to see
my serious face?

07:56.309 --> 07:57.602
- No, no, no, no, no.

07:57.685 --> 07:59.562
I mean, thanks for
the offer and everything,

07:59.645 --> 08:01.397
but I have to check with
Jessie, you know,

08:01.480 --> 08:03.900
make sure she's
okay with this.

08:03.983 --> 08:07.069
- Or we can use this as a way
to convince her to come with you

08:07.153 --> 08:08.696
and then we could all stay
here together.

08:08.779 --> 08:10.698
- Do you know what Jake Novoa
will do if he finds out

08:10.781 --> 08:11.866
his son is
living with us?

08:11.949 --> 08:14.535
You already helped take
his daughter from him.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.454
- I don't disagree
with you,

08:16.537 --> 08:18.831
but I already
made a promise.

08:18.915 --> 08:21.876
And I don't break
my promises... often.

08:21.959 --> 08:22.752
[scoffs]

08:23.836 --> 08:26.172
- Andi, Daniel, can you
give us a second?

08:26.255 --> 08:27.423
- But I didn't
get my answer.

08:27.506 --> 08:28.466
- And I brokered this
whole thing 'cause--

08:28.549 --> 08:29.508
- Please?

08:29.592 --> 08:31.052
- Fine, let's go.

08:31.135 --> 08:31.928
Lunch is on you.

08:35.514 --> 08:38.142
- Is anyone
going to answer me?

08:38.226 --> 08:41.979
- [yodeling]

08:42.063 --> 08:43.063
- Oh, look at that!

08:43.147 --> 08:44.524
Your knee sock
is falling.

08:44.607 --> 08:45.524
Let me help you.

08:45.608 --> 08:48.236
- It is possible,
isn't it?

08:48.319 --> 08:48.986
You're just
not powerful enough.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.864
- Emma!

08:51.948 --> 08:54.742
- You just hold on,
Miss Magic.

08:54.825 --> 08:55.868
- Why should I?

08:55.952 --> 08:57.662
Ever since I found out
I was a witch,

08:57.745 --> 08:59.413
all this Council has done
is tried to reign me in.

08:59.497 --> 09:02.875
Not anymore--
I want answers!

09:02.959 --> 09:04.627
- What you're saying...

09:04.710 --> 09:07.046
It's...

09:07.129 --> 09:07.755
It's not simply...

09:07.838 --> 09:09.423
- I knew it was true.

09:09.507 --> 09:11.342
There is a way
to turn back time.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.140
[sighing]

09:20.935 --> 09:23.020
[ram bleating]

09:23.104 --> 09:23.729
- Wait, Emma, wait.

09:25.022 --> 09:25.690
Do you know what I should
feed this thing?

09:28.192 --> 09:30.027
[electricity crackling]

09:30.111 --> 09:31.362
- Oh, what?

09:35.616 --> 09:36.158
- Hi, there.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.202
- What's up?

09:38.286 --> 09:39.662
- Don't let me disturb you.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.914
I was just in the market
for a quiet place to think.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.000
- Ditto.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.502
- I'll just go,
you were here first.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.045
- They say anything?

09:48.129 --> 09:50.339
The Council.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.174
- Well, they definitely don't
want me

09:52.258 --> 09:53.718
messing with time anymore.

09:53.801 --> 09:54.844
But that doesn't
mean I won't try.

09:54.927 --> 09:58.222
Who are they to tell me
how I can use my magic?

09:58.306 --> 09:59.765
I'm the Chosen One.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.394
Do you really want to go
back to the Everglades?

10:03.477 --> 10:04.937
- Is that so hard
to believe?

10:05.021 --> 10:08.024
I just...

10:08.107 --> 10:09.942
When I remembered
my Miami life,

10:10.026 --> 10:12.445
this flood of emotions
just came rushing back.

10:12.528 --> 10:14.363
But something
felt off,

10:14.447 --> 10:15.406
like I didn't belong.

10:15.489 --> 10:18.159
And now
I know why.

10:18.242 --> 10:19.410
It's because
I don't.

10:19.493 --> 10:20.536
I belong there.

10:23.122 --> 10:23.914
- Speaking of Emma,

10:23.998 --> 10:27.209
I've been
thinking and...

10:27.293 --> 10:27.960
I'm pretty sure I can
get through to her.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.879
- How?

10:29.962 --> 10:32.048
[gasps]
By talking to her?

10:32.131 --> 10:33.591
Get a clue!

10:33.674 --> 10:34.633
That girl is on a one-way
path to destruction.

10:34.717 --> 10:37.261
- And I've been
to destruction.

10:37.345 --> 10:38.512
It's not pretty.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.431
- She's a teen.

10:40.514 --> 10:41.932
And if you
haven't noticed,

10:42.016 --> 10:43.768
she's been going through
a bit of a tough time lately.

10:43.851 --> 10:46.228
Don't you guys remember what
it's like to be teenagers?

10:46.312 --> 10:47.355
- Hmm.

10:47.438 --> 10:48.397
[together]
No.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.858
- We must take
action immediately.

10:50.941 --> 10:52.276
- What kind of action?

10:52.360 --> 10:55.237
- The only kind of
action we can take.

10:55.321 --> 10:58.366
We must strip her of her
powers once and for all.

10:58.449 --> 11:00.659
- I know I'm still new at
this whole Council thing,

11:00.743 --> 11:03.162
but I think you already
tried that before.

11:03.245 --> 11:04.413
- Correct.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.748
But that was
before we knew.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.460
The Secret of the Triad.

11:09.543 --> 11:11.087
- It is an
ancient spell,

11:11.170 --> 11:13.714
only to be used with
universal agreement

11:13.798 --> 11:16.384
between three
Council members.

11:16.467 --> 11:19.095
- Up until now it was
an implausible feat.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.805
Agamemnon and I had
a missing piece.

11:23.140 --> 11:23.474
- But that would mean--

11:23.557 --> 11:25.768
- Yes.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.604
You would have to
help us.

11:28.687 --> 11:30.606
You have seen the error
of the Chosen One's ways,

11:30.689 --> 11:33.109
and you will help us.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.361
- But I--
I don't have any powers.

11:35.444 --> 11:36.779
- That's no matter.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.657
If we all hold hands and form
a perfect Pythagorean triangle,

11:39.740 --> 11:43.160
any one of us
can cast the spell.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.453
- And once it works,

11:44.537 --> 11:47.331
the Chosen One will be
just another teenager

11:47.415 --> 11:49.583
with absolutely
no powers.

11:55.214 --> 11:56.215
- Jessie?

11:57.299 --> 11:58.175
Jessie?

11:59.260 --> 12:01.721
I thought you quit
this hide-and-seek.

12:03.931 --> 12:06.183
I'm unbeatable with my
invisibility, remember?

12:29.248 --> 12:32.877
- "Jax, as you can see I took
back Captain El Capitan.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.005
"I knew it was the only
place I could hide this note.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.715
"I had to take off
with Dad.

12:37.798 --> 12:40.259
"Not sure when I'll be
back or where I'm going,

12:40.342 --> 12:41.469
"but I'm safe.

12:41.552 --> 12:43.637
"Hope to
see you soon.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.182
"Love, Jessie.

12:46.265 --> 12:49.018
"By the way, I also ate your
leftovers from dinner.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.686
I was hungry,
really hungry."

12:58.944 --> 13:02.031
- Was that as insanely sweet
for you as it was for me?

13:02.114 --> 13:03.199
Dad?

13:04.700 --> 13:05.618
Dad?

13:05.701 --> 13:07.411
- Yes, Jessie?

13:07.495 --> 13:10.414
- Did we really just travel
9,000 miles in two seconds?

13:10.498 --> 13:11.290
Why are we
in Australia?

13:11.373 --> 13:12.791
Do kangaroos
really box?

13:12.875 --> 13:17.713
- Jessie, you're on what I like
to call a need to know basis.

13:17.796 --> 13:20.466
And all you need to know is
that it was imperative

13:20.549 --> 13:22.092
to leave Miami
right away.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.428
And yes,
kangaroos can box.

13:24.512 --> 13:25.679
- But why?

13:25.763 --> 13:26.847
- I'm not sure.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.766
It must be in their
genetic make-up.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.061
Of course,
you meant Miami.

13:32.144 --> 13:35.231
Look, we left because
your mother's in town.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.066
- Don't tell me you're
afraid of Mom.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.860
- Please, don't be
ridiculous.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.488
She just isn't the type of
person that can be trusted.

13:42.571 --> 13:44.698
- [chuckling]

13:44.782 --> 13:46.367
- Is that funny?

13:46.450 --> 13:48.077
- It's just, people tell me
the same thing about you.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.204
- Well, you shouldn't believe
everything you hear.

13:50.287 --> 13:52.414
- You just told me I was going
to go on my first plane ride,

13:52.498 --> 13:54.959
then tele-transported me

13:55.042 --> 13:58.087
from Miami to Australia
in two seconds.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.756
- There's so much you
don't know right now.

14:00.839 --> 14:03.384
In due time, my dear,
in due time.

14:07.638 --> 14:10.140
- This is a pretty messed-up
situation, huh?

14:10.224 --> 14:11.267
- The messiest.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.561
- I wish I could help you,
I really do.

14:13.644 --> 14:15.771
But I don't
have any answers,

14:15.854 --> 14:16.272
at least not yet.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.274
- I know.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.067
It was a long shot
anyway.

14:20.150 --> 14:21.944
- Look, I can't make
any promises.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.280
But I might be able
to figure this out...

14:24.363 --> 14:26.615
on my own.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.242
- Is it even safe
for you to try?

14:28.325 --> 14:29.451
- Probably not.

14:31.203 --> 14:32.246
But I guess
we'll find out.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.874
- I just don't want
you to get hurt.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.711
- And I want to
take away your hurt.

14:44.675 --> 14:45.759
[phone beeping]

14:46.343 --> 14:48.679
[beep]

14:48.762 --> 14:49.972
- Hey, Em...

14:50.055 --> 14:51.599
Why are you
still in bed?

14:51.682 --> 14:53.934
We were supposed to leave for
school, like, two minutes ago.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.020
- Just catching up
on some rest, you know?

14:56.103 --> 14:57.771
- Well, how long
are you gonna take?

14:57.855 --> 14:59.189
'Cause if I'm late again,

14:59.273 --> 15:01.275
Mrs. O'Connor is gonna
make me run sprints.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.901
- Mrs. O'Connor
teaches algebra.

15:02.985 --> 15:06.155
- I know,
that's the weird part.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.531
- We're fine.

15:07.615 --> 15:08.782
You need to relax.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.669
Nah, too much work.

15:28.969 --> 15:29.845
All set.

15:38.979 --> 15:40.564
- I got to get you
over to my house!

15:48.364 --> 15:50.407
Ahem!

15:50.491 --> 15:51.575
I'm starving.

15:55.371 --> 15:56.246
- [chuckling]

15:57.414 --> 16:00.292
- Yogurt?

16:00.376 --> 16:01.835
Yogurt.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.170
It's as if my friendship
means nothing to you.

16:07.841 --> 16:09.885
Lumberjack breakfast?

16:09.968 --> 16:11.220
Come here, bestie.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.892
Don't take this
the wrong way--

16:16.975 --> 16:18.644
I mean, getting to school
in a magical go-kart

16:18.727 --> 16:20.270
is the funnest thing
I've done all week--

16:20.354 --> 16:22.940
but, um, just,
maybe you should

16:23.023 --> 16:24.650
tone down the magic
a little bit.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.193
- What's the point
in having magic

16:26.276 --> 16:27.778
if I can't use it
when I want to?

16:27.861 --> 16:30.030
How are you
not having fun?

16:30.114 --> 16:31.240
- Oh, I am.

16:31.323 --> 16:32.741
And I love
to have fun.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.368
But you know
what would be fun?

16:34.451 --> 16:35.828
If we take the bus
home today.

16:35.911 --> 16:36.745
- Just the two of us?

16:36.829 --> 16:39.081
I can make
that happen.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.416
Think of all the space!

16:40.499 --> 16:43.293
- Um, no, that's not
really what I meant.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.170
- And don't worry.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.256
This isn't all
fun and games.

16:47.339 --> 16:50.300
I'm pushing myself to see
what I'm really capable of.

16:50.384 --> 16:51.844
I'm starting to
think bigger, Andi.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.431
- Morning, ladies.

16:55.514 --> 16:56.890
- Lily.
- Hey.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.475
- Um, Andi,
do you have a sec?

16:58.559 --> 17:00.269
I was wondering if you could
help me with that thing

17:00.352 --> 17:01.603
on my door?

17:02.604 --> 17:03.856
- You know what?

17:03.939 --> 17:05.315
I came to school
on a magical go-kart.

17:05.398 --> 17:07.276
I am not asking
any questions.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.487
So, what's up?

17:10.570 --> 17:14.031
- Have you noticed anything
different about Emma lately?

17:14.116 --> 17:15.159
- Different how?

17:15.242 --> 17:17.661
- Like, out of control
different?

17:17.744 --> 17:18.787
- Hang on a sec.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.457
Now, maybe what you
call out of control,

17:21.540 --> 17:23.459
I call becoming
more confident.

17:23.541 --> 17:27.128
- There's a difference between
confidence and cockiness, Andi.

17:27.212 --> 17:29.381
When you have great power
you have great responsibility.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.091
And if Emma doesn't start
being more wise

17:31.175 --> 17:31.592
with how she uses her
powers, things could just--

17:31.675 --> 17:34.052
- I know.

17:34.136 --> 17:34.970
I know, people could
get hurt.

17:35.053 --> 17:37.723
- No, people will
get hurt,

17:37.806 --> 17:38.724
that I can
guarantee you.

17:38.807 --> 17:42.352
In fact,
they already have.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.938
Look at Daniel.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.982
You and I need to present
a unified front,

17:47.066 --> 17:48.358
work as a team.

17:48.442 --> 17:51.653
Because if we don't get through
to her, the Council--

17:51.737 --> 17:54.114
We are going
to take her powers.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.115
- I'm in.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.366
Whatever you need.

17:56.450 --> 17:57.493
But I am
going to need

17:57.576 --> 17:59.328
a lumberjack breakfast
once a week.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.666
- This line is so long!

18:04.750 --> 18:05.542
- Taco day.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.503
Everyone loves
taco day.

18:07.586 --> 18:10.839
- Once a year everyone should be
allowed one line cut at lunch.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.508
- You know when
I'd use mine?

18:12.591 --> 18:13.801
Taco day.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.679
- [clearing throat]

18:17.763 --> 18:18.514
- What do you
think you're doing?

18:18.597 --> 18:20.766
- Sorry, girls.

18:20.849 --> 18:22.226
I have a saved spot.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.103
- Ugh! Maddie!

18:27.105 --> 18:28.023
- Hmm.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.448
Now for the tricky part.

18:41.203 --> 18:44.248
- Are you stand-up
sleeping?

18:44.331 --> 18:45.374
- It worked!

18:45.457 --> 18:46.834
- What, the stand-up
sleeping?

18:46.917 --> 18:48.627
Could you teach me because
I tried it once in gym

18:48.710 --> 18:50.546
and I caught a dodge ball
right between the eyes.

18:54.925 --> 18:56.844
- I know I have the power
to stop everyone's day,

18:56.927 --> 18:58.220
but unfreeze this person
so we can both play.

19:01.014 --> 19:02.307
- Hello?

19:02.391 --> 19:04.184
Come on, people, it's like
you're like statues!

19:04.268 --> 19:06.562
You've never
seen a tortilla before?

19:12.192 --> 19:13.902
What did you do?

19:13.986 --> 19:15.320
- Stopped time...

19:15.404 --> 19:17.865
and then restarted it,
and then stopped it again!

19:17.948 --> 19:18.866
Come on!

19:23.662 --> 19:24.621
- Em...

19:26.999 --> 19:27.249
- Mustaches, anyone?

19:29.835 --> 19:30.919
- Stop.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.508
Okay, why not?

19:36.592 --> 19:37.926
No, no, I can't.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.261
Emma, I need to
talk to you.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.971
- Andi, you know
what this means?

19:41.054 --> 19:42.806
I bet I can
tele-transport now!

19:42.890 --> 19:43.640
- Wha--Emma, no!

19:46.143 --> 19:48.604
- Yes, I love tacos.

19:48.687 --> 19:49.771
Do you want guaca--

19:49.855 --> 19:51.440
Oh!

19:51.523 --> 19:53.442
- What are you
"oh"-ing?

19:53.525 --> 19:55.444
- [chuckling]
You...

19:55.527 --> 19:57.905
You, you grew
a mustache.

19:58.822 --> 20:00.324
- What?

20:00.407 --> 20:01.283
- Yeah.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.371
- [laughing]
Okay, so maybe I haven't

20:06.455 --> 20:08.290
perfected
tele-transporting yet.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.000
- Emma, so not funny!

20:10.083 --> 20:11.293
- So let's hear it.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.544
- Hear it?

20:12.628 --> 20:13.462
- You said you wanted to talk,
so let's do it.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.547
- Okay, well,
would you mind?

20:15.631 --> 20:15.964
- Oh.
[laughing]

20:16.048 --> 20:16.214
Right.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.845
[laughing]

20:24.598 --> 20:26.266
- Oh, come on!

20:27.559 --> 20:28.685
- [sighing]

20:30.062 --> 20:31.146
- Thanks.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.065
This is what I wanted
to talk to you about.

20:33.148 --> 20:34.566
Your powers,
they're--

20:34.650 --> 20:35.901
<i>AGAMEMNON:</i>
<i>Out of control.</i>

20:35.984 --> 20:38.278
- Yes, exactly what Ag--

20:38.362 --> 20:38.987
Wait.

20:44.368 --> 20:47.287
- We know what you've
been up to, young lady.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.915
Starting and
stopping time

20:49.998 --> 20:52.084
multiple times.

20:52.167 --> 20:54.086
- Uh... so what?

20:54.169 --> 20:56.630
- You've abused
your power,

20:56.713 --> 20:58.340
that's "so what".

20:58.423 --> 21:00.133
And now, you have
forced our hand.

21:00.217 --> 21:03.971
- This is why I wanted
to talk to you.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.639
- What?

21:05.722 --> 21:06.765
- They're upset.

21:06.848 --> 21:08.266
- Oh, stop.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.018
This is a
serious matter.

21:10.811 --> 21:12.646
Proceed.

21:12.729 --> 21:15.440
- Emma Alonso...

21:15.524 --> 21:17.859
You have been given
ample opportunity

21:17.943 --> 21:21.655
to prove yourself worthy
of your great powers.

21:21.738 --> 21:25.158
But sadly, you have done
nothing but prove to us

21:25.242 --> 21:29.037
that you are unfit
as the Chosen One.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.664
- I'm sorry, Emma.

21:30.747 --> 21:32.082
We're taking
your powers.

21:32.165 --> 21:33.208
- Really?

21:33.291 --> 21:34.501
We're going
through this again?

21:34.584 --> 21:36.503
You've already tried
to strip them.

21:36.586 --> 21:37.796
It didn't work.

21:37.879 --> 21:40.090
- That was before
we had...

21:40.173 --> 21:42.259
The Secret of the Triad.

21:42.342 --> 21:43.885
- [gasping]

21:43.969 --> 21:46.221
- What's that?

21:46.304 --> 21:47.681
- I don't really know,
but it doesn't sound good.

21:47.764 --> 21:51.560
- The one and only way to remove
any and all of your powers.

21:51.643 --> 21:53.228
A spell to
end all spells.

21:53.311 --> 21:57.774
We were unaware of it,
until now.
