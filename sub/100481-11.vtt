WEBVTT

00:24.367 --> 00:26.033
>> John: HELLO THERE, AND

00:26.100 --> 00:27.533
WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL

00:27.600 --> 00:29.066
TAKING PLACE INSIDE THIS VOID,

00:29.133 --> 00:30.100
WHICH I'VE ACTUALLY NICKNAMED

00:30.166 --> 00:30.967
"MOMMY."

00:31.033 --> 00:34.867
WHY HAVE I DONE THAT?

00:34.934 --> 00:36.233
WELL, BECAUSE IT'S WHITE,

00:36.300 --> 00:37.467
CHILLY, AND WANTS ME OUT OF IT

00:37.533 --> 00:38.233
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

00:38.300 --> 00:39.133
HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY, EVERYONE!

00:39.200 --> 00:40.433
NOW, OBVIOUSLY, MANY OF US ARE

00:40.500 --> 00:40.934
STILL WORKING FROM HOME.

00:41.000 --> 00:41.567
EVEN THE SUPREME COURT IS

00:41.633 --> 00:42.300
HEARING ARGUMENTS REMOTELY.

00:42.367 --> 00:43.500
AND THIS WEEK, IT SEEMS THEY HAD

00:43.567 --> 00:44.767
A LITTLE MISHAP.

00:44.834 --> 00:46.500
>> WHAT THE FTC HAS SAID IS THAT

00:46.567 --> 00:47.200
WHEN...

00:48.266 --> 00:49.400
THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE

00:49.467 --> 00:50.533
CALL RANGES TO THE TOPIC, THEN

00:50.600 --> 00:52.367
THE CALL IS TRANSFORMED.

00:52.433 --> 00:53.734
>> John: YEAH, SOMEONE

00:53.800 --> 00:54.834
APPARENTLY FLUSHED A TOILET

00:54.900 --> 00:56.300
DURING THE ORAL ARGUMENTS.

00:56.367 --> 01:01.033
AND LOOK, I GET WORKING FROM

01:01.100 --> 01:02.667
HOME IS A BIT OF AN ADJUSTMENT,

01:02.734 --> 01:03.300
BUT THERE'S SIMPLY NO EXCUSE FOR

01:03.367 --> 01:03.834
THAT LEVEL OF UNPROFESS --

01:04.467 --> 01:05.100
GODDAMNIT!

01:05.166 --> 01:05.900
NOT NOW!

01:05.967 --> 01:06.900
DADDY'S FILMING THE SHOW!

01:06.967 --> 01:07.867
NO POOPING ON SHOW DAYS!

01:07.934 --> 01:09.133
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS:

01:09.200 --> 01:10.200
WE ONLY POOP ON TUESDAYS.

01:10.266 --> 01:11.767
THAT IS IT.

01:11.834 --> 01:14.266
TUESDAYS, WE POOP ALL DAY.

01:14.333 --> 01:15.166
ON FRIDAYS, WE ALL DRAW CARDS,

01:15.233 --> 01:16.000
AND IF YOU PULL THE ACE OF

01:16.066 --> 01:17.066
SPADES, YOU CAN DO A BONUS POOP.

01:17.133 --> 01:17.700
BUT WE DO!

01:17.767 --> 01:18.333
NOT!

01:18.400 --> 01:19.000
POOP!

01:19.066 --> 01:19.734
ON!

01:19.800 --> 01:20.500
SHOW DAYS!

01:20.567 --> 01:22.533
EVER!

01:22.600 --> 01:24.433
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

01:24.500 --> 01:25.700
IT WAS ANOTHER BUSY WEEK FOR THE

01:25.767 --> 01:26.600
WHITE HOUSE, ALTHOUGH

01:26.667 --> 01:28.166
REFRESHINGLY, ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:28.233 --> 01:29.367
PIECES OF NEWS WAS NOT ACTUALLY

01:29.433 --> 01:31.400
CORONAVIRUS RELATED:

01:31.467 --> 01:33.633
>> 29 MONTHS AFTER LEAVING THIS

01:33.700 --> 01:34.967
COURTHOUSE IN SHAME FOLLOWING

01:35.033 --> 01:37.100
PLEADING GUILTY TO LYING TO THE

01:37.166 --> 01:39.200
FBI, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT

01:39.266 --> 01:40.767
CONVICTED MICHAEL FLYNN NOW

01:40.834 --> 01:41.967
SEEKING TO THROW OUT THE CASE.

01:42.033 --> 01:43.033
>> A CRIME CANNOT BE ESTABLISHED

01:43.100 --> 01:44.367
HERE.

01:44.433 --> 01:46.734
THEY DID NOT HAVE A BASIS FOR A

01:46.800 --> 01:48.100
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

01:48.166 --> 01:49.300
INVESTIGATION AGAINST FLYNN AT

01:49.367 --> 01:50.700
THAT STAGE.

01:50.767 --> 01:51.533
>> DOES THE FACT REMAIN THAT HE

01:51.600 --> 01:52.633
LIED?

01:52.700 --> 01:53.867
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE

01:53.934 --> 01:55.400
SOMETIMES PLEAD TO THINGS THAT

01:55.467 --> 01:57.800
TURN OUT NOT TO BE CRIMES.

01:57.867 --> 02:00.433
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

02:00.500 --> 02:01.600
SOMETIMES PEOPLE DO PLEAD TO

02:01.667 --> 02:02.700
THINGS THAT TURN OUT NOT TO BE

02:02.767 --> 02:04.400
CRIMES.

02:04.467 --> 02:05.800
BUT SOMETIMES THEY PLEAD TO

02:05.867 --> 02:07.233
THINGS THAT ARE, LIKE, I DUNNO,

02:07.300 --> 02:08.633
LYING TO THE FBI, WHICH IS, IN A

02:08.700 --> 02:10.200
VERY REAL SENSE, A FUCKING

02:10.266 --> 02:11.867
CRIME.

02:11.934 --> 02:13.000
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IF

02:13.066 --> 02:14.633
FLYNN HAD PLED GUILTY TO, LET'S

02:14.700 --> 02:15.700
SAY, CONSTANTLY DISPLAYING THE

02:15.767 --> 02:17.200
FACIAL EXPRESSION OF SOMEONE

02:17.266 --> 02:19.233
WHOSE LUNCH BURRITO ISN'T

02:19.300 --> 02:20.567
SITTING QUITE RIGHT, OR LOOKING

02:20.633 --> 02:21.734
LIKE G.I. JOE'S EMOTIONALLY

02:21.800 --> 02:22.233
WITHHOLDING FATHER.

02:22.300 --> 02:23.533
THOSE AREN'T CRIMES.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.500
LYING TO THE FBI, HOWEVER, IS.

02:26.567 --> 02:28.367
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER

02:28.433 --> 02:30.133
THAT WHAT FLYNN WAS LYING ABOUT

02:30.200 --> 02:31.967
WAS HIS CONTACTS WITH A RUSSIAN

02:32.033 --> 02:33.533
OFFICIAL AND THE FBI WAS IN THE

02:33.600 --> 02:34.734
MIDST OF A RUSSIAN

02:34.800 --> 02:35.734
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

02:35.800 --> 02:37.033
INVESTIGATION.

02:37.100 --> 02:38.400
AND ALL THIS IS PARTICULARLY

02:38.467 --> 02:40.100
WORRYING BECAUSE THIS WAS A CASE

02:40.166 --> 02:41.400
BROUGHT BY SPECIAL COUNSEL

02:41.467 --> 02:42.967
ROBERT MUELLER, AND THE WHOLE

02:43.033 --> 02:44.333
POINT OF HAVING A SPECIAL

02:44.400 --> 02:45.333
COUNSEL INVESTIGATE WAS TO KEEP

02:45.400 --> 02:46.400
THE PROCESS FREE FROM CONFLICTS

02:46.467 --> 02:48.100
OF INTEREST.

02:48.166 --> 02:49.867
BY DROPPING THESE CHARGES, BARR

02:49.934 --> 02:50.934
COULD BE SETTING A DANGEROUS

02:51.000 --> 02:52.033
PRECEDENT, THAT A PRESIDENT

02:52.100 --> 02:53.567
COULD NOT JUST PARDON THE

02:53.633 --> 02:55.600
SUBJECT OF AN INVESTIGATION BUT

02:55.667 --> 02:56.567
HAVE HIS APPOINTEES INVALIDATE

02:56.633 --> 02:58.333
THE INVESTIGATION ITSELF.

02:58.400 --> 03:00.000
IT'S A TRULY UNHEARD-OF THING

03:00.066 --> 03:01.266
FOR AN ATTORNEY GENERAL TO DO,

03:01.333 --> 03:04.567
BUT BARR REALLY DOESN'T SEEM TO

03:04.633 --> 03:06.467
GIVE A FUCK.

03:06.533 --> 03:08.200
>> WHEN HISTORY LOOKS BACK ON

03:08.266 --> 03:10.100
THIS DECISION, HOW DO YOU THINK

03:10.166 --> 03:11.834
IT WILL BE WRITTEN?

03:11.900 --> 03:12.934
>> WELL, HISTORY IS WRITTEN BY

03:13.000 --> 03:14.200
THE WINNERS, SO IT LARGELY

03:14.266 --> 03:15.200
DEPENDS ON...

03:16.467 --> 03:18.033
WHO'S WRITING THE HISTORY.

03:18.100 --> 03:20.100
>> John: WOW!

03:20.166 --> 03:21.166
NOW, IF I WERE THE PRESIDENT'S

03:21.233 --> 03:22.800
LACKEY TRYING TO TWIST THE

03:22.867 --> 03:24.300
JUSTICE SYSTEM TO HIS WILL, I

03:24.367 --> 03:25.500
MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED THAT SIMPLE

03:25.567 --> 03:26.934
QUESTION WITH SOMETHING LIKE

03:27.000 --> 03:27.900
"HISTORY WILL SHOW THIS WAS THE

03:27.967 --> 03:28.934
RIGHT DECISION," OR "IT WAS A

03:29.000 --> 03:30.133
TOUGH CALL BUT JUSTICE WAS

03:30.200 --> 03:31.934
SERVED."

03:32.000 --> 03:33.734
IT TAKES A SPECIAL KIND OF

03:33.800 --> 03:35.133
ARROGANCE FOR THE NATION'S TOP

03:35.200 --> 03:36.667
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL TO SAY,

03:36.734 --> 03:38.166
"ACTUALLY, HISTORY IS A LIE WE

03:38.233 --> 03:41.533
TELL OURSELVES AS WE FALL

03:41.600 --> 03:43.066
ASLEEP AT NIGHT, THE WORLD IS

03:43.133 --> 03:44.133
NOTHING BUT FORMLESS CHAOS, AND

03:44.200 --> 03:45.166
THERE IS NO TRUTH BUT THAT WHICH

03:45.233 --> 03:47.633
THE STRONG IMPOSE UPON THE WEAK.

03:47.700 --> 03:51.000
YOU GET IT, RIGHT?

03:51.066 --> 03:51.767
YOU DEFINITELY GET IT."

03:51.834 --> 03:52.734
AS FOR THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF, HE

03:52.800 --> 03:53.300
SPENT THE WEEK CONTINUING TO

03:53.367 --> 03:53.967
MANAGE THE OPTICS ON HIS

03:54.033 --> 03:54.967
INABILITY TO MANAGE THE

03:55.033 --> 03:56.333
CORONAVIRUS, EVEN TRAVELING TO A

03:56.400 --> 03:57.567
MASK FACTORY, WHERE HE MADE THE

03:57.633 --> 03:59.433
CONSPICUOUS CHOICE NOT TO WEAR A

03:59.500 --> 04:00.567
MASK, PROMPTING AN ENTIRELY

04:00.633 --> 04:01.734
REASONABLE QUESTION THE NEXT

04:01.800 --> 04:04.433
DAY.

04:04.500 --> 04:05.767
>> MR. PRESIDENT, YESTERDAY WE

04:05.834 --> 04:07.333
WENT TO ARIZONA, AND YOU HAD

04:07.400 --> 04:08.400
SAID BEFORE THE TRIP THAT YOU

04:08.467 --> 04:09.133
WOULD LIKELY WEAR A MASK AT THE

04:09.200 --> 04:10.567
MASK FACTORY.

04:10.633 --> 04:11.467
YOU ENDED UP NOT WEARING ONE.

04:11.533 --> 04:12.400
>> WELL, I ACTUALLY DID HAVE

04:12.467 --> 04:13.233
ONE.

04:13.300 --> 04:14.700
>> WE DIDN'T SEE YOU WITH A MASK

04:14.767 --> 04:15.300
ON.

04:15.367 --> 04:16.400
>> WELL, I CAN'T HELP IT IF YOU

04:16.467 --> 04:16.834
DIDN'T SEE ME.

04:16.900 --> 04:17.467
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

04:17.533 --> 04:18.367
ABOUT?

04:18.433 --> 04:19.400
"I CAN'T HELP IT IF YOU DIDN'T

04:19.467 --> 04:19.900
SEE ME"?

04:19.967 --> 04:20.967
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

04:21.033 --> 04:22.433
IT'S A PHOTO OP.

04:22.500 --> 04:23.834
THE WHOLE POINT IS TO SHOW THEM

04:23.934 --> 04:25.033
THE THING THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED

04:25.100 --> 04:28.300
TO BE DOING.

04:28.367 --> 04:29.266
STILL, I WILL SAY THIS, FOR ALL

04:29.333 --> 04:30.200
TRUMP'S IDEOLOGICAL WAVERING

04:30.266 --> 04:32.467
OVER THE YEARS, ONE THING HAS

04:32.533 --> 04:34.133
REMAINED CONSISTENT: HE'S NEVER

04:34.200 --> 04:35.100
USED PROTECTION, AND HE'S NEVER

04:35.166 --> 04:35.900
NOT BEEN AN ASSHOLE ABOUT IT

04:35.967 --> 04:38.233
AFTERWARDS.

04:38.300 --> 04:40.066
BUT TRUMP'S REFUSAL TO WEAR A

04:40.133 --> 04:41.233
FACE MASK, DESPITE THE FACT

04:41.300 --> 04:42.867
THAT, SINCE APRIL 3, THE CDC HAS

04:42.934 --> 04:44.734
RECOMMENDED EVERYONE WEAR THEM,

04:44.800 --> 04:45.834
SEEMS ESPECIALLY UNWISE, GIVEN

04:45.900 --> 04:47.633
THAT MULTIPLE WHITE HOUSE

04:47.700 --> 04:49.600
STAFFERS HAVE NOW TESTED

04:49.667 --> 04:51.033
POSITIVE, WHICH, IN TURN, MAKES

04:51.100 --> 04:52.800
ONE OF THE MUSIC CHOICES FOR

04:52.867 --> 04:53.900
THAT MASK FACTORY TOUR EVEN

04:53.967 --> 04:55.233
GRIMMER.

04:55.300 --> 04:58.333
>> THIS IS THE MATERIAL THAT

04:58.400 --> 04:59.667
TRAPS THE PARTICULATES...

04:59.734 --> 05:03.333
>> ♪ LIVE AND LET DIE ♪

05:06.166 --> 05:10.633
♪ LIVE AND LET DIE ♪

05:10.700 --> 05:11.633
>> John: YEAH.

05:11.700 --> 05:13.433
THAT WAS THE GUNS 'N ROSES COVER

05:13.500 --> 05:15.667
OF THE SONG "LIVE AND LET DIE,"

05:15.734 --> 05:16.934
WHICH IS ABOUT AS ON THE NOSE A

05:17.000 --> 05:19.233
SOUNDTRACK CHOICE AS YOU CAN GET

05:19.300 --> 05:20.367
WITHOUT PLAYING THE

05:20.433 --> 05:22.633
DEAD KENNEDYS' "KILL THE POOR."

05:22.700 --> 05:23.433
AND IT'S A WEIRD CHOICE OF SONG

05:23.500 --> 05:24.567
NO MATTER WHAT, BUT IT'S

05:24.633 --> 05:26.233
ESPECIALLY WEIRD GIVEN THAT

05:26.300 --> 05:27.767
AXL ROSE IS NO FAN OF THIS

05:27.834 --> 05:30.200
ADMINISTRATION, EVEN TWEETING

05:30.266 --> 05:30.700
THE VERY NEXT DAY, "IT'S

05:30.767 --> 05:31.633
OFFICIAL!

05:31.700 --> 05:32.400
WHATEVER ANYONE MAY HAVE

05:32.467 --> 05:33.500
PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT OF

05:33.567 --> 05:34.233
STEVE MNUCHIN, HE'S OFFICIALLY

05:34.300 --> 05:35.367
AN ASSHOLE."

05:35.433 --> 05:37.033
WHICH KICKED OFF AN INCREDIBLE

05:37.100 --> 05:39.500
EXCHANGE IN WHICH MNUCHIN

05:39.567 --> 05:40.767
RESPONDED BY WRITING, "WHAT HAVE

05:40.834 --> 05:41.800
YOU DONE FOR YOUR COUNTRY

05:41.867 --> 05:43.033
LATELY," ACCOMPANIED BY THE

05:43.100 --> 05:44.300
LIBERIAN FLAG, TO WHICH AXL ROSE

05:44.367 --> 05:46.233
THEN REPLIED, IN A SINGLE

05:46.300 --> 05:47.200
SENTENCE, "MY BAD, I DIDN'T GET

05:47.266 --> 05:49.266
WE'RE HOPING TO EMULATE

05:49.333 --> 05:50.567
LIBERIA'S ECONOMIC MODEL, BUT ON

05:50.633 --> 05:51.934
THE REAL, UNLIKE THIS ADMIN, I'M

05:52.000 --> 05:53.500
NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR 70K PLUS

05:53.567 --> 06:01.266
DEATHS N' UNLIKE YOU I DON'T

06:01.333 --> 06:02.700
HOLD A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

06:02.767 --> 06:04.000
POSITION OF RESPONSIBILITY TO

06:04.066 --> 06:05.400
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE N' GO ON TV

06:05.467 --> 06:06.467
TELLIN' THEM TO TRAVEL TO THE

06:06.533 --> 06:07.066
U.S. DURING A PANDEMIC."

06:07.133 --> 06:07.800
AND THERE ARE MANY AMAZING

06:07.867 --> 06:08.467
THINGS ABOUT THAT, BUT MOST OF

06:08.533 --> 06:09.333
ALL, YOU GOT TO RESPECT AXL'S

06:09.400 --> 06:10.233
COMMITMENT TO THE "N'."

06:10.300 --> 06:11.266
I BET HE TAKES HIS COFFEE WITH

06:11.333 --> 06:13.033
MILK N' SUGAR.

06:13.100 --> 06:14.433
WHEN HE GETS DRESSED, HE LIKES

06:14.500 --> 06:16.400
TO PUT ON A T-SHIRT N' KILT.

06:16.467 --> 06:17.266
AND I BET HIS FAVORITE BOOK IS

06:17.333 --> 06:18.266
"HARRY POTTER N' THE PRISONER OF

06:18.333 --> 06:19.967
AZKABAN."

06:20.033 --> 06:20.867
BECAUSE HE'S A PROFESSIONAL, AND

06:20.934 --> 06:23.033
HIS ART IS HIS LIFE.

06:23.100 --> 06:24.867
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, TRUMP'S

06:24.934 --> 06:26.166
CAVALIER ATTITUDE SEEMS TO BE

06:26.233 --> 06:27.133
TRICKLING DOWN, BECAUSE SOME

06:27.200 --> 06:28.467
STATES ARE NOW LETTING

06:28.533 --> 06:30.200
STAY-AT-HOME ORDERS EXPIRE, EVEN

06:30.266 --> 06:32.166
THOUGH MANY OF THEM DON'T MEET

06:32.233 --> 06:33.100
THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES

06:33.166 --> 06:34.834
SUGGESTING THEY ONLY REOPEN ONCE

06:34.900 --> 06:36.133
CASES BEGIN TO DECLINE.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.967
AND WHILE THAT WILL ALMOST

06:38.033 --> 06:39.367
CERTAINLY PUT AMERICAN LIVES AT

06:39.433 --> 06:40.900
RISK, TRUMP'S NEW TACTIC IS TO

06:40.967 --> 06:42.767
FRAME THAT AS A POSITIVE.

06:42.834 --> 06:44.133
>> ALL PEOPLE ARE WARRIORS IN

06:44.200 --> 06:44.934
THIS COUNTRY.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.200
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE ALL WARRIORS.

06:46.266 --> 06:47.734
YOU'RE WARRIORS, WE'RE WARRIORS.

06:47.800 --> 06:48.633
YOU CAN BE WITH SOMEBODY,

06:48.700 --> 06:49.934
EVERYTHING IS FINE, AND THEN

06:50.000 --> 06:51.367
SOMETHING HAPPENS TO THAT

06:51.433 --> 06:52.600
PERSON, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU

06:52.667 --> 06:55.200
TEST POSITIVE.

06:55.266 --> 06:56.333
AND WE'RE ALL WARRIORS TOGETHER.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.633
I AM.

06:57.700 --> 06:58.433
YOU ARE.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.867
WE ALL ARE.

06:59.934 --> 07:00.900
>> John: OH, ARE WE?

07:00.967 --> 07:02.166
THAT'S INTERESTING.

07:02.233 --> 07:03.600
BECAUSE WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE

07:03.667 --> 07:08.633
TO BE WARRIORS.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.000
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE,

07:10.066 --> 07:10.633
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE THROWING US

07:10.700 --> 07:11.367
INTO BATTLE UNARMED BEFORE WE

07:11.433 --> 07:12.066
HAVE MECHANISMS SET UP TO TEST,

07:12.133 --> 07:12.700
ISOLATE, AND TRACE CASES OF THE

07:12.767 --> 07:14.533
VIRUS.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.033
YOU CAN'T JUST CALL EVERYONE

07:16.100 --> 07:17.700
"WARRIORS" AND MAKE THEIR DEATHS

07:17.767 --> 07:18.567
NOT COUNT.

07:18.633 --> 07:20.066
YOU GET THE SENSE THAT, IF GOD

07:20.133 --> 07:21.467
HAD TOLD TRUMP ABOUT THE FLOOD,

07:21.533 --> 07:23.033
HE WOULDN'T HAVE BOTHERED

07:23.100 --> 07:24.333
BUILDING THE ARK, HE WOULD HAVE

07:24.400 --> 07:25.033
JUST TRIED TO CONVINCE THE

07:25.100 --> 07:26.000
ANIMALS THEY'RE ALL FISH.

07:26.066 --> 07:33.300
"WE'RE ALL FISH TOGETHER NOW.

07:33.367 --> 07:34.300
I'M A FISH, YOU'RE A FISH, WE'RE

07:34.367 --> 07:34.567
ALL FISH."

07:34.633 --> 07:35.333
AND TRUMP'S ALLIES ARE BEHIND

07:35.400 --> 07:35.967
HIM ON THIS CALL TO ACTION.

07:36.033 --> 07:36.734
ONE OF HIS FAVORITE FOX NEWS

07:36.800 --> 07:38.000
HOSTS, PETE HEGSETH, SEEN HERE

07:38.066 --> 07:38.700
SHOWING OFF THE CARCASS OF AN

07:38.767 --> 07:39.667
AMERICAN FLAG HE MURDERED, TOOK

07:39.734 --> 07:41.834
THAT IDEA AND RAN WITH IT.

07:41.900 --> 07:43.266
>> I DO THINK YOU'RE GONNA NEED

07:43.333 --> 07:45.066
THAT KIND OF ETHOS AND THAT

07:45.133 --> 07:46.700
SPIRIT TO PUT FREEDOM BEFORE

07:46.767 --> 07:47.667
FEAR.

07:47.734 --> 07:48.567
HEALTHY PEOPLE GETTING OUT

07:48.633 --> 07:50.266
THERE, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

07:50.333 --> 07:51.467
HAVE SOME COURAGE.

07:51.533 --> 07:54.734
AND SO I THINK THAT SPIRIT, THE

07:54.800 --> 07:56.000
AMERICAN SPIRIT FRANKLY IS -- IS

07:56.066 --> 08:01.166
IN FULL SUPPLY AND READY TO GO.

08:01.233 --> 08:02.266
>> John: OH, YEAH, THE AMERICAN

08:02.333 --> 08:02.867
SPIRIT IS ABSOLUTELY IN FULL

08:02.934 --> 08:03.500
SUPPLY, IF BY "AMERICAN SPIRIT"

08:03.567 --> 08:04.533
YOU MEAN "GHOSTS."

08:04.600 --> 08:06.033
BECAUSE WE'RE CHURNING OUT

08:06.100 --> 08:07.600
GHOSTS LIKE IT'S 1918, BABY.

08:07.667 --> 08:08.600
WE ARE POSITIVELY SWIMMING IN

08:08.667 --> 08:10.533
ECTOPLASM.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.467
I'M TELLING YOU, IF YOU COULD

08:12.533 --> 08:13.734
WIPE YOUR ASS WITH GHOSTS, THE

08:13.800 --> 08:18.533
AMERICAN PEOPLE WOULD TRULY WANT

08:18.600 --> 08:19.333
FOR NOTHING RIGHT NOW.

08:19.400 --> 08:20.233
THE THING IS, ALL THIS TALK OF

08:20.300 --> 08:21.667
AMERICANS BEING "BRAVE WARRIORS"

08:21.734 --> 08:24.133
SEEMS DESIGNED TO MAKE US ACCEPT

08:24.200 --> 08:25.567
DEATHS THAT WE SHOULD BE TRYING

08:25.633 --> 08:28.667
TO PREVENT.

08:28.734 --> 08:29.367
AND YET THIS ADMINISTRATION

08:29.433 --> 08:30.367
SEEMS, AT TIMES, TO BE ACTIVELY

08:30.433 --> 08:31.266
HOSTILE TO THOSE PREVENTION

08:31.333 --> 08:31.900
EFFORTS, TO THE POINT THAT, ON

08:31.967 --> 08:34.000
THURSDAY, WE LEARNED THIS:

08:34.066 --> 08:35.300
>> AS THE PRESIDENT URGES STATES

08:35.367 --> 08:36.867
TO REOPEN, THE CDC HAS PREPARED

08:36.934 --> 08:38.633
A DRAFT ROADMAP TO HELP

08:38.700 --> 08:39.967
RESTAURANTS, SCHOOLS, CHURCHES,

08:40.033 --> 08:43.467
AND OTHERS TO DO IT SAFELY.

08:43.533 --> 08:44.667
BUT TODAY, WE LEARNED

08:44.734 --> 08:45.467
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS REJECTED

08:45.533 --> 08:46.433
THAT DRAFT.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.633
>> THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, WHO WAS

08:47.700 --> 08:48.867
FIRST TO REPORT THE

08:48.934 --> 08:50.066
ADMINISTRATION'S HOLD ON THE

08:50.133 --> 08:51.900
GUIDELINES, SAYING A CDC

08:51.967 --> 08:53.033
OFFICIAL TOLD THEM THE AGENCY'S

08:53.100 --> 08:54.300
SCIENTISTS WERE TOLD THE

08:54.367 --> 08:55.266
DOCUMENT WOULD, "NEVER SEE THE

08:55.333 --> 08:56.567
LIGHT OF DAY."

08:56.633 --> 08:58.600
>> John: WOW.

08:58.667 --> 09:00.500
"NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY."

09:00.567 --> 09:02.800
IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE HOW

09:02.867 --> 09:04.133
DRACONIAN THAT IS, OR AT LEAST

09:04.200 --> 09:05.133
IT WAS BEFORE "NEVER SEEING THE

09:05.200 --> 09:06.266
LIGHT OF DAY" BECAME THE ONLY

09:06.333 --> 09:09.867
THING ON ALL OF OUR SCHEDULES.

09:09.934 --> 09:11.166
HONESTLY, TELL ME, WHAT DOES THE

09:11.233 --> 09:11.800
SUN LOOK LIKE?

09:11.867 --> 09:12.700
DOES IT HAVE COOL SHADES AND AN

09:12.767 --> 09:18.834
ATTITUDE, OR WAS THAT JUST

09:18.900 --> 09:19.567
SOMETHING THAT WE MADE UP IN THE

09:19.633 --> 09:20.066
PAST?

09:20.133 --> 09:20.834
I SINCERELY CAN'T REMEMBER.

09:20.900 --> 09:21.900
SO THIS IS WHERE WE ARE NOW:

09:21.967 --> 09:22.700
OUR WARTIME PRESIDENT HAS

09:22.767 --> 09:23.834
DECIDED THAT THE ONLY WAY TO WIN

09:23.900 --> 09:25.033
THIS WAR IS TO DRAFT EVERY ONE

09:25.100 --> 09:28.533
OF US, HIDE OUR BATTLE PLANS,

09:28.600 --> 09:29.834
AND HOPE THAT WE'RE ALL BRAVE

09:29.900 --> 09:30.967
ENOUGH NOT TO NOTICE THAT WE'VE

09:31.033 --> 09:32.166
ALREADY SURRENDERED.

09:32.233 --> 09:33.233
OR, TO PUT IT MORE SUCCINCTLY --

09:33.300 --> 09:34.934
AND TO QUOTE WHAT SEEMS TO BE

09:35.000 --> 09:35.800
ONE OF HIS FAVORITE SONGS -- HIS

09:35.867 --> 09:36.633
PLAN TO STEER US THROUGH THIS

09:36.700 --> 09:37.767
PANDEMIC IS FOR HIM TO LIVE

09:37.834 --> 09:39.867
WHILE LETTING A LOT OF US DIE.

09:39.934 --> 09:45.500
AND NOW THIS.

09:45.567 --> 09:47.667
>> Announcer: AND NOW,

09:47.734 --> 09:50.533
"VICE WEEKLY" DALLAS IS

09:50.600 --> 09:51.233
STEVE EAGAR IT READS YOUR

09:51.300 --> 09:53.667
COMPLAINTS OUT LOUD.

09:53.734 --> 09:57.300
>> MILLICENT SAYS SHE DOESN'T

09:57.367 --> 09:58.934
LIKE SEEING PEOPLE WEAR GLOVES.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.667
MARK AND WEATHERFORD WANTS

10:02.734 --> 10:05.066
LANDLORD, WHY IS IT ASSUMED THE

10:05.133 --> 10:06.533
LANDLORDS HAVE NO BILLS TO PAY

10:06.600 --> 10:09.100
AND ARE RICH?

10:09.166 --> 10:09.867
WILLIAM WANTS SOMEBODY TO WIPE

10:09.934 --> 10:12.700
DOWN CREDIT CARD KEYPADS.

10:12.767 --> 10:14.233
ERIC HAS A DEEP STATE COVER.

10:14.300 --> 10:16.533
SHE IS SICK OF SEEING SICK

10:16.600 --> 10:18.066
PEOPLE.

10:18.133 --> 10:19.100
PEOPLE SEEM TO BE COMPLAINING TO

10:19.166 --> 10:20.133
COMPLAIN AND THEY DON'T KNOW

10:20.200 --> 10:22.667
WHAT IS UP, LIKE THIS ONE FROM

10:22.734 --> 10:24.300
COLLEEN, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

10:24.367 --> 10:26.266
WHY YOU OUT ONLY SHOW THE

10:26.333 --> 10:26.834
NEGATIVE WITH THIS VIRUS.

10:26.900 --> 10:29.333
YOU KNOW THIS IS A PLOY TO

10:29.400 --> 10:30.333
DESTROY OUR COUNTRY FROM THE

10:30.400 --> 10:30.867
INSIDE.

10:30.967 --> 10:33.633
WHY ARE THERE SO MANY PEOPLE

10:33.700 --> 10:34.066
OUTSIDE TODAY?

10:34.133 --> 10:35.767
WHY DON'T YOU REPORT ABOUT THE

10:35.834 --> 10:35.934
FLU?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.900
I AM APPALLED AT THE DECISION TO

10:38.967 --> 10:40.200
ALLOW MASSAGE PARLORS, WE ALL

10:40.266 --> 10:42.266
KNOW WHAT MASSAGE PARLORS MEAN.

10:42.333 --> 10:44.367
ANIMALS CAN STILL GET GROOMED.

10:44.433 --> 10:48.934
THIS IS A SLAP IN THE FACE

10:49.000 --> 10:49.700
DEMONS.

10:49.767 --> 10:51.233
STEVE EAGAR IS A SICK MAN.

10:51.300 --> 10:53.300
TELL HIM TO LEAVE VIEWERS ALONE.

10:53.367 --> 10:55.500
DON'T YOU REALIZE HOW STUPID

10:55.567 --> 10:57.467
MOST OF THE VIEWING AUDIENCE IS?

10:57.533 --> 11:01.500
OH, I AM AWARE, WENDY.

11:01.567 --> 11:02.567
>> John: MOVING ON.

11:02.633 --> 11:03.500
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

11:03.567 --> 11:04.100
THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE, THE

11:04.166 --> 11:04.667
ORGANIZATION THAT WOULD HAVE

11:04.734 --> 11:05.433
DELIVERED YOUR MOTHER'S DAY CARD

11:05.500 --> 11:06.500
FOR TODAY IF YOU HADN'T

11:06.567 --> 11:07.266
FORGOTTEN TO MAIL ONE LIKE AN

11:07.333 --> 11:08.166
UNGRATEFUL SACK OF SHIT.

11:08.233 --> 11:10.133
THE USPS PROVIDES VALUABLE

11:10.200 --> 11:11.200
SERVICES, FROM DELIVERING MAIL

11:11.266 --> 11:12.033
AND PACKAGES TO BRILLIANTLY

11:12.100 --> 11:14.500
RUINING TIKTOK VIDEOS.

11:23.233 --> 11:28.066
HOW YOU DOIN'?

11:28.133 --> 11:28.867

11:28.934 --> 11:31.767
FROM THE WAVE, TO THE LAUGH, TO

11:31.834 --> 11:32.300
THE "HOW YOU DOIN'," EVERY

11:32.367 --> 11:32.900
SINGLE PART OF THAT IS GREAT.

11:32.967 --> 11:33.900
I WANT THAT WOMAN TO INTERRUPT

11:33.967 --> 11:36.500
EVERY TIKTOK VIDEO.

11:36.567 --> 11:38.300
IN FACT, TAKE THIS ONE OF AN

11:38.367 --> 11:38.800

11:50.367 --> 11:51.266
EXACTLY, HARD TO IMPROVE ON.

11:51.333 --> 11:53.567
BUT WATCH THIS:

>> ♪ WHAT? ♪

11:55.533 --> 12:03.300

12:06.100 --> 12:06.266
BETTER.

12:06.333 --> 12:07.166
THAT'S A CAKE ON A CAKE.

12:07.233 --> 12:08.100
KEEP CRASHING TIKTOKS, YOU

12:08.166 --> 12:08.633
NATIONAL FUCKING TREASURE.

12:08.700 --> 12:09.667
THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS A RICH

12:09.734 --> 12:10.734
AND STORIED HISTORY.

12:10.800 --> 12:14.066
IT ACTUALLY PREDATES THE

12:14.133 --> 12:15.900
FOUNDING OF THE COUNTRY AND IT

12:15.967 --> 12:16.867
HAS AN OBLIGATION TO BRING MAIL

12:16.934 --> 12:17.600
TO EVERY SINGLE HOUSEHOLD, EVEN

12:17.667 --> 12:18.700
TRANSPORTING IT TO THE BOTTOM OF

12:18.767 --> 12:19.533
THE GRAND CANYON BY MULE.

12:19.600 --> 12:20.767
OVER THE YEARS, AMERICANS HAVE

12:20.834 --> 12:22.367
RELIED ON IT FOR A SURPRISINGLY

12:22.433 --> 12:23.467
WIDE VARIETY OF NEEDS.

12:23.533 --> 12:24.600
>> COUNTRY CHILDREN OFTEN WATCH

12:24.667 --> 12:26.500
FOR THE MAILMAN.

12:26.567 --> 12:28.233
JUST SEE WHAT HAS COME TODAY.

12:28.300 --> 12:30.333
A BIG BOX WITH MANY HOLES IN IT.

12:30.400 --> 12:33.333
THE BOX IS FULL OF BABY CHICKS.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.166
BABY CHICKS DON'T HAVE TO EAT OR

12:35.233 --> 12:36.200
DRINK FOR A WHOLE DAY AFTER

12:36.266 --> 12:37.233
THEY'RE HATCHED, SO THEY CAN

12:37.300 --> 12:39.033
TRAVEL SAFELY THROUGH THE MAIL.

12:39.100 --> 12:40.467
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

12:40.533 --> 12:41.433
YOU USED TO BE ABLE TO SEND LIVE

12:41.500 --> 12:42.967
BABY CHICKS THROUGH THE MAIL.

12:43.066 --> 12:44.233
AND GUESS WHAT?

12:44.300 --> 12:45.600
YOU STILL CAN!

12:45.667 --> 12:47.333
THE POSTAL SERVICE WILL

12:47.400 --> 12:50.066
TRANSPORT ALL KINDS OF LIVE

12:50.133 --> 12:52.633
POULTRY FOR YOU, INCLUDING

12:52.700 --> 12:54.300
CHICKENS, DUCKS, GEESE, AND

12:54.367 --> 12:55.066
TURKEYS.

12:55.133 --> 12:56.100
WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION, WHY

12:56.166 --> 12:56.767
THE FUCK WOULD I EVER SEND A

12:56.834 --> 12:58.100
GREETING CARD AGAIN WHEN I COULD

12:58.166 --> 12:59.166
MAIL SOMEONE A BIRTHDAY TURKEY

12:59.233 --> 13:00.533
OR A THANK YOU DUCK OR A

13:00.600 --> 13:01.567
SYMPATHY GOOSE?

13:01.633 --> 13:02.900
WHO WOULDN'T WANT A SYMPATHY

13:02.967 --> 13:04.166
GOOSE?

13:04.233 --> 13:06.500
I MEAN, SURE, YOUR NANA'S DEAD.

13:06.567 --> 13:07.800
BUT NOW YOU HAVE A SMALL GOOSE!

13:07.867 --> 13:08.700
WHICH IS -- AND THIS IS TRUE --

13:08.767 --> 13:10.100
BETTER.

13:10.166 --> 13:12.033
BUT THE CURRENT PANDEMIC IS

13:12.066 --> 13:13.700
OBVIOUSLY MAKING THINGS VERY

13:13.767 --> 13:15.500
DIFFICULT FOR POSTAL WORKERS, AS

13:15.533 --> 13:16.433
YOU PROBABLY KNOW FROM SEEING

13:16.500 --> 13:19.400
STORIES LIKE THESE.

13:19.433 --> 13:23.867
>> I AM VERY WORRIED, VERY

13:23.934 --> 13:25.133
WORRIED, I MEAN, TO THE POINT

13:25.233 --> 13:26.500
THAT I WORRY ABOUT COMING TO

13:26.533 --> 13:27.600
WORK EVERY DAY.

13:27.667 --> 13:28.767
>> I DON'T WANT TO CONTRACT IT,

13:28.867 --> 13:29.400
TO BRING IT BACK TO MY FAMILY.

13:29.433 --> 13:30.066
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE AT

13:30.133 --> 13:30.867
RISK EVERY TIME YOU GO TO WORK?

13:30.934 --> 13:32.166
>> YES.

13:32.233 --> 13:33.700
>> CAN'T SAY THAT IT'S NOT ON

13:33.767 --> 13:38.967
THE BACK OF EVERYBODY'S MIND.

13:39.033 --> 13:40.500
THERE IS A JOKE AMONGST THE

13:40.533 --> 13:41.600
OFFICE, ARE WE ESSENTIAL OR ARE

13:41.667 --> 13:42.200
WE SACRIFICIAL?

13:42.266 --> 13:43.000
>> John: HOLY SHIT, THAT IS A

13:43.066 --> 13:43.400
DARK JOKE.

13:43.467 --> 13:44.200
MOST OFFICE HUMOR IS ON THE

13:44.266 --> 13:44.867
LEVEL OF "WORKING HARD OR HARDLY

13:44.934 --> 13:45.367
WORKING?"

13:45.433 --> 13:47.400
OR "SOMEONE'S MICROWAVING FISH

13:47.467 --> 13:49.033
AGAIN," NOT "WILL ANY OF US DIE

13:49.100 --> 13:50.900
TODAY, LMFAO."

13:50.967 --> 13:51.967
AND THOSE FEARS ARE NOT

13:52.033 --> 13:53.266
MISPLACED.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.834
OVER A THOUSAND POSTAL WORKERS

13:54.900 --> 13:55.734
HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR

13:55.800 --> 13:56.867
COVID-19, AND MORE THAN 40 HAVE

13:56.934 --> 13:59.066
DIED.

13:59.133 --> 14:00.967
BUT BOTH IN ADDITION TO AND

14:01.033 --> 14:02.934
BECAUSE OF THE ONGOING PANDEMIC,

14:03.000 --> 14:04.834
THESE WORKERS ARE ALSO HAVING TO

14:04.900 --> 14:05.900
GRAPPLE WITH ANOTHER EXISTENTIAL

14:05.967 --> 14:08.066
THREAT: THE POSTAL SERVICE MAY

14:08.133 --> 14:09.433
BE ABOUT TO GO BROKE.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.066
THE OUTGOING POSTMASTER GENERAL

14:11.133 --> 14:12.900
RECENTLY ASKED CONGRESS FOR A

14:12.967 --> 14:15.300
TOTAL OF $89 BILLION, AND

14:15.367 --> 14:16.700
WITHOUT FINANCIAL HELP, THE USPS

14:16.767 --> 14:19.200
MAY NOT MAKE IT PAST SEPTEMBER

14:19.266 --> 14:20.834
WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT SERVICE

14:20.900 --> 14:22.000
INTERRUPTIONS, WHICH IS

14:22.066 --> 14:23.166
UPSETTING, ESPECIALLY DURING AN

14:23.233 --> 14:24.633
ELECTION YEAR, A CENSUS YEAR,

14:24.700 --> 14:26.700
AND A PANDEMIC THAT HAS PEOPLE

14:26.767 --> 14:28.467
HOUSEBOUND.

14:28.533 --> 14:30.734
AND I KNOW PEOPLE LIKE TO

14:30.800 --> 14:32.233
COMPLAIN ABOUT THE POST OFFICE,

14:32.300 --> 14:33.633
BUT THE TRUTH IS, IT DOES

14:33.700 --> 14:35.633
VERY IMPORTANT WORK.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.367
AND MANY PEOPLE REALLY RELY ON

14:37.433 --> 14:38.834
IT, NOT JUST TO RECEIVE

14:38.900 --> 14:40.266
PACKAGES, BUT IN RURAL AREAS IN

14:40.333 --> 14:41.467
PARTICULAR, A POST OFFICE CAN BE

14:41.533 --> 14:42.900
A COMMUNITY HUB THAT BRINGS

14:42.967 --> 14:44.166
PEOPLE TOGETHER.

14:44.233 --> 14:45.567
JUST LISTEN TO THIS POSTMASTER

14:45.633 --> 14:47.033
IN RURAL COLORADO TELL A

14:47.100 --> 14:48.900
HEARTWARMING STORY WITH A BIT OF

14:48.967 --> 14:51.200
A TWIST.

14:51.266 --> 14:52.667
>> POSTMASTER BURGER SAYS

14:52.734 --> 14:53.934
NEIGHBORS WHO LIVE FAR APART RUN

14:54.000 --> 14:55.166
INTO EACH OTHER AT THE POST

14:55.233 --> 14:55.900
OFFICE.

14:55.967 --> 14:57.033
THAT'S HOW EVERYBODY KEEPS IN

14:57.100 --> 14:58.967
TOUCH, INCLUDING HIM.

14:59.033 --> 15:00.567
>> IT'S PROVIDED ME THE

15:00.633 --> 15:02.066
OPPORTUNITY TO -- TO KNOW THESE

15:02.133 --> 15:03.133
PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN MORE THAN I

15:03.200 --> 15:04.867
EVER THOUGHT I WOULD KNOW.

15:04.934 --> 15:06.100
EVEN TO THE DEGREE WHERE

15:06.166 --> 15:07.667
SOMETIMES ON MY LUNCH HOUR I

15:07.734 --> 15:08.633
FIND MYSELF HELPING A NEIGHBOR

15:08.700 --> 15:09.633
BURY HIS DOG.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.100
>> John: OKAY.

15:11.166 --> 15:12.300
FIRST: WHAT?

15:12.367 --> 15:14.500
SECOND: EXCUSE ME?

15:14.567 --> 15:15.934
AND THIRD, JUST TO CIRCLE BACK:

15:16.000 --> 15:18.734
THE FUCK?

15:18.800 --> 15:20.100
ALSO, YOU JUST SAID "SOMETIMES"

15:20.166 --> 15:20.700
YOU HELP BURY A DOG.

15:20.767 --> 15:21.734
THAT'S PLURAL.

15:21.800 --> 15:22.700
MEANING YOU'VE DONE IT MORE THAN

15:22.767 --> 15:23.367
ONCE.

15:23.433 --> 15:24.533
AND HELPING SOMEONE DO THAT ONCE

15:24.600 --> 15:26.500
IS A COURTESY, BUT WHEN IT

15:26.567 --> 15:27.600
STARTS BECOMING A REGULAR THING,

15:27.667 --> 15:29.300
YOU HAVE TO WONDER WHY THE

15:29.367 --> 15:30.400
NEIGHBORHOOD DOGS KEEP DYING AND

15:30.467 --> 15:32.967
WHY YOU'RE ALWAYS THERE.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.100
THE POINT IS, AT THE WORST

15:35.166 --> 15:36.667
POSSIBLE TIME, THIS AMERICAN

15:36.734 --> 15:38.600
INSTITUTION IS ON THE BRINK OF

15:38.667 --> 15:39.433
COLLAPSE.

15:39.500 --> 15:40.633
SO TONIGHT, WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT

15:40.700 --> 15:42.133
BE WORTH ASKING WHY THAT IS AND

15:42.200 --> 15:43.600
WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT.

15:43.667 --> 15:44.700
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

15:44.767 --> 15:45.967
THAT, DESPITE BEING PART OF THE

15:46.033 --> 15:46.867
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THE POSTAL

15:46.934 --> 15:48.000
SERVICE IS ACTUALLY A

15:48.066 --> 15:49.900
SELF-FUNDED ENTITY.

15:49.967 --> 15:51.800
IT OPERATES INDEPENDENTLY AND IS

15:51.867 --> 15:52.700
MEANT TO PAY FOR ITSELF WITH THE

15:52.767 --> 15:53.567
MONEY THAT IT MAKES FROM

15:53.633 --> 15:56.934
SERVICES AND POSTAGE.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.867
THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY, OVER THE

15:58.934 --> 15:59.433
YEARS, IT'S OFTEN TRIED TO

15:59.500 --> 16:00.900
ENCOURAGE STAMP COLLECTING WITH

16:00.967 --> 16:02.834
COMMERCIALS LIKE THIS:

16:23.033 --> 16:24.500
AND ALSO, KUDOS ON FEATURING ALL

16:24.567 --> 16:26.500
THE STAMPS THAT KIDS LOVE, FROM

16:26.567 --> 16:31.266
THOSE SLAMMIN' DINO STAMPS TO

16:31.333 --> 16:32.600
THE DANK GET WELL STAMP WITH

16:32.667 --> 16:34.100
IRISES TO MY PERSONAL FAVORITE,

16:34.166 --> 16:36.000
THE ONE THAT SAYS "LACEMAKING."

16:36.066 --> 16:37.533
AND I THINK I SPEAK FOR COOL

16:37.600 --> 16:39.066
KIDS EVERYWHERE WHEN I SAY

16:39.133 --> 16:40.233
THERE'S NOTHING DOPER THAN A

16:40.300 --> 16:44.734
TOTALLY BITCHIN' LACE STAMP.

16:44.800 --> 16:48.367
I'M JUST WORRIED IT MIGHT BE

16:48.433 --> 16:49.400
TOO COOL.

16:49.467 --> 16:50.633
AND YOU MAY THINK YOU KNOW WHY

16:50.700 --> 16:51.266
THE POSTAL SERVICE IS IN SO MUCH

16:51.333 --> 16:51.934
TROUBLE -- THAT THE INTERNET AND

16:52.000 --> 16:52.500
EMAIL MEAN THAT PEOPLE JUST

16:52.567 --> 16:52.967
DON'T USE IT AS MUCH.

16:53.033 --> 16:53.700
BUT THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE MAIN

16:53.767 --> 16:54.834
REASON.

16:54.900 --> 16:55.633
IN FACT, EXPERTS BELIEVE IT

16:55.700 --> 16:57.133
WOULD STILL BE TURNING A PROFIT

16:57.200 --> 16:58.667
WERE IT NOT FOR A 2006 LAW

16:58.734 --> 16:59.433
CALLED THE POSTAL ACCOUNTABILITY

16:59.500 --> 17:02.900
AND ENHANCEMENT ACT.

17:02.967 --> 17:04.533
NOW, ONE OF THE THINGS IT

17:04.600 --> 17:05.567
REQUIRED WAS FOR THE USPS TO

17:05.633 --> 17:07.133
PREPAY HEALTH CARE BENEFITS FOR

17:07.200 --> 17:08.667
RETIREES ON A 50-YEAR SCHEDULE,

17:08.734 --> 17:10.266
STARTING WITH AN AGGRESSIVE

17:10.333 --> 17:11.600
OBLIGATION TO SET ASIDE OVER

17:11.667 --> 17:14.166
$5 BILLION A YEAR FOR 10 YEARS.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.834
THAT, IN ITSELF, WAS A MASSIVE

17:15.900 --> 17:17.300
BURDEN TO PUT ON THE POSTAL

17:17.367 --> 17:19.800
SERVICE, BUT THE LAW ALSO

17:19.867 --> 17:21.467
LIMITED ITS FLEXIBILITY TO RAISE

17:21.533 --> 17:23.166
MONEY BY PUTTING PRICE CAPS ON

17:23.233 --> 17:24.500
MAJOR PRODUCTS LIKE FIRST-CLASS

17:24.567 --> 17:26.800
MAIL.

17:26.867 --> 17:28.367
SO THEY HAD MASSIVE NEW

17:28.433 --> 17:29.433
OBLIGATIONS TO MEET EVEN AS

17:29.500 --> 17:31.400
THEIR INCOME WAS BASICALLY

17:31.467 --> 17:32.400
LOCKED IN PLACE.

17:32.467 --> 17:33.834
IN HINDSIGHT, IT SEEMS LIKE A

17:33.900 --> 17:34.967
PRETTY CLEAR DEATH SENTENCE,

17:35.033 --> 17:36.333
WHICH IS WHAT MAKES IT SO

17:36.400 --> 17:37.200
STRANGE THAT IT PASSED LARGELY

17:37.266 --> 17:39.467
UNNOTICED AT THE TIME AND WITH

17:39.533 --> 17:41.200
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.

17:41.266 --> 17:43.100
AND THE EFFECT WAS ALMOST

17:43.166 --> 17:44.400
IMMEDIATE, BECAUSE THE POSTAL

17:44.467 --> 17:47.033
SERVICE WENT FROM REPORTING A

17:47.100 --> 17:48.900
NET INCOME OF $900 MILLION IN

17:48.967 --> 17:52.066
2006 TO A LOSS OF $3.8 BILLION

17:52.133 --> 17:53.934
JUST THREE YEARS LATER.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.100
AND GOOD LUCK SELLING ENOUGH

17:57.166 --> 17:58.767
DOPE-ASS LACE STAMPS TO GET

17:58.834 --> 18:00.333
YOURSELF OUT OF THAT HOLE.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.600
SO THE TRUTH IS, THE POSTAL

18:02.667 --> 18:05.533
SERVICE'S PROBLEMS AREN'T

18:05.600 --> 18:06.367
ENTIRELY FROM THE FACT THAT WE

18:06.433 --> 18:07.333
STARTED USING EMAIL OR EVEN THE

18:07.400 --> 18:09.433
2008 RECESSION.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.033
IN FACT, IT'S BEEN ESTIMATED

18:11.100 --> 18:12.166
THAT THE STIPULATIONS OF THIS

18:12.233 --> 18:15.133
ONE LAW HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR

18:15.200 --> 18:17.133
APPROXIMATELY 74% OF THEIR

18:17.200 --> 18:21.233
NET LOSSES SINCE IT PASSED, AND

18:21.300 --> 18:22.333
THAT IS DESPITE THEM SHEDDING

18:22.400 --> 18:22.800
OVER 100,000 JOBS.

18:22.867 --> 18:23.600
AND THE FACT THEY WERE SO BADLY

18:23.667 --> 18:24.633
HOBBLED BY AN ACT OF CONGRESS

18:24.700 --> 18:25.800
MAKES IT A LITTLE INFURIATING

18:25.867 --> 18:27.166
THAT SOME, LIKE FORMER FOX NEWS

18:27.233 --> 18:28.500
COMMENTATOR JOHN STOSSEL, HOLD

18:28.567 --> 18:29.567
IT UP AS A SIGN THAT GOVERNMENT

18:29.633 --> 18:31.433
AGENCIES ARE JUST NATURALLY

18:31.500 --> 18:33.900
BLOATED AND INCOMPETENT.

18:33.967 --> 18:36.567
>> ANOTHER MYTH.

18:36.633 --> 18:37.533
GOVERNMENT CAN RUN THE POST

18:37.600 --> 18:38.467
OFFICE LIKE A BUSINESS.

18:38.533 --> 18:40.000
BUT REAL BUSINESSES CAN'T LOSE

18:40.066 --> 18:42.100
BILLIONS EVERY YEAR.

18:42.166 --> 18:43.500
$16 BILLION LAST YEAR.

18:43.567 --> 18:44.800
FEDEX, UPS, AND OTHERS MAKE

18:44.867 --> 18:46.767
BILLIONS BECAUSE THEY INNOVATE

18:46.834 --> 18:48.433
AND CUT COSTS.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.066
>> John: OKAY, THERE'S A LOT

18:50.133 --> 18:51.567
WRONG WITH THAT, BUT HE'S RIGHT

18:51.633 --> 18:53.100
THAT FEDEX IS PRETTY GOOD AT

18:53.166 --> 18:54.066
INNOVATING.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.967
FOR EXAMPLE, YOU'VE PROBABLY

18:56.033 --> 18:56.800
SEEN THE ARROW HIDDEN IN THE

18:56.867 --> 18:57.800
FEDEX LOGO, BUT DID YOU KNOW

18:57.867 --> 19:00.934
THAT, FOR YEARS, THERE USED TO

19:01.000 --> 19:01.900
BE A SWASTIKA HIDDEN IN THE

19:01.967 --> 19:06.367
"D"?

19:06.433 --> 19:07.667
YEAH, ONCE YOU SEE IT, LIKE THE

19:07.734 --> 19:08.500
ARROW, YOU CAN'T UNSEE IT.

19:08.567 --> 19:09.066
BUT THEY TOOK IT OUT BECAUSE

19:09.133 --> 19:10.033
BUSINESSES HAVE TO INNOVATE.

19:10.100 --> 19:11.066
NOW, WHAT STOSSEL IS ADVOCATING

19:11.133 --> 19:11.600
FOR THERE -- AND WHAT MANY

19:11.667 --> 19:12.500
CONSERVATIVES WOULD PREFER -- IS

19:12.567 --> 19:13.367
FOR THE POSTAL SERVICE TO BE

19:13.433 --> 19:14.166
PRIVATIZED.

19:14.233 --> 19:15.467
BUT THERE ARE SOME HUGE

19:15.533 --> 19:16.834
DRAWBACKS TO THAT IDEA.

19:16.900 --> 19:18.133
FOR STARTERS -- AS YOU MAY HAVE

19:18.200 --> 19:20.467
NOTICED -- FEDEX AND UPS CHARGE

19:20.533 --> 19:21.967
A FUCK OF A LOT MORE TO DELIVER

19:22.033 --> 19:24.066
THAN THE POSTAL SERVICE DOES.

19:24.133 --> 19:27.934
ALSO, THOSE REMOTE ADDRESSES

19:28.000 --> 19:28.934
THAT THEY ARE OBLIGATED TO

19:29.000 --> 19:29.700
DELIVER TO AREN'T JUST DIFFICULT

19:29.767 --> 19:30.867
TO GET TO, THEY'RE NOT

19:30.934 --> 19:31.834
PROFITABLE, AND IN ALL

19:31.900 --> 19:32.967
LIKELIHOOD, COMPANIES WOULD CUT

19:33.033 --> 19:34.367
THOSE ROUTES OFF, MEANING A LOT

19:34.433 --> 19:35.734
OF PEOPLE WOULD LOSE ACCESS.

19:35.800 --> 19:40.700
AND TO HIS CREDIT, JOHN STOSSEL

19:40.767 --> 19:45.467
FULLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT,

19:45.533 --> 19:46.333
ALTHOUGH HE BASICALLY SAYS IN

19:46.400 --> 19:46.967
RESPONSE, "TOUGH SHIT."

19:47.033 --> 19:47.633
>> THE CONSTITUTION SAYS

19:47.700 --> 19:48.433
CONGRESS HAS THE POWER TO

19:48.500 --> 19:48.934
ESTABLISH POST OFFICES.

19:49.000 --> 19:49.600
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO AND IT

19:49.667 --> 19:50.400
DOESN'T HAVE TO DELIVER MAIL TO

19:50.467 --> 19:51.233
ALL OF AMERICA.

19:51.300 --> 19:52.100
WHO SAYS THERE NEEDS TO BE

19:52.166 --> 19:53.834
UNIVERSAL SERVICE?

19:53.900 --> 19:54.934
IF I LIVE WAY OUT IN THE

19:55.000 --> 20:03.433
BOONDOCKS, I CAN GET E-MAIL.

20:03.500 --> 20:04.200
>> John: NOW, IT'S HARD TO

20:04.266 --> 20:04.600
DECIDE WHAT I LIKE

20:04.667 --> 20:05.300
LEAST ABOUT THAT: HIS DISMISSIVE

20:05.367 --> 20:05.767
ATTITUDE TOWARDS RURAL

20:05.834 --> 20:06.266
AMERICANS; THE INCORRECT

20:06.333 --> 20:07.100
ASSUMPTION THAT EMAIL IS A

20:07.166 --> 20:08.700
DECENT SUBSTITUTE FOR THE POSTAL

20:08.767 --> 20:09.633
SERVICE, CONVENIENTLY GLOSSING

20:09.700 --> 20:10.300
OVER THE FACT THAT AN ESTIMATED

20:10.367 --> 20:11.300
42 MILLION PEOPLE LACK ACCESS TO

20:11.367 --> 20:13.300
BROADBAND INTERNET; OR THE

20:13.367 --> 20:14.967
UNFORTUNATE FACT THAT

20:15.033 --> 20:16.367
JOHN STOSSEL LOOKS LIKE WHAT

20:16.433 --> 20:17.767
WOULD HAPPEN IF SOMEONE TRIED TO

20:17.834 --> 20:20.300
QUEER EYE GERALDO RIVERA BUT IT

20:20.367 --> 20:22.567
DIDN'T REALLY WORK.

20:22.633 --> 20:23.600
AND AGAIN, THE POSTAL SERVICE

20:23.667 --> 20:24.834
IS A LITERAL LIFELINE FOR MANY

20:24.900 --> 20:26.333
AMERICANS.

20:26.400 --> 20:27.900
IT REPORTEDLY DELIVERED

20:27.967 --> 20:30.567
1.2 BILLION PRESCRIPTIONS LAST

20:30.633 --> 20:32.300
YEAR, INCLUDING CLOSE TO 100% OF

20:32.367 --> 20:34.066
PRESCRIPTIONS FROM THE VA.

20:34.133 --> 20:35.934
AND WHILE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO

20:36.000 --> 20:37.433
BUY MEDICINE ONLINE, YOU CAN'T

20:37.500 --> 20:39.467
ACTUALLY DOWNLOAD MEDICINE FROM

20:39.533 --> 20:40.633
THE INTERNET.

20:40.700 --> 20:41.800
TO CLARIFY, YOU CAN DOWNLOAD

20:41.867 --> 20:43.400
"THE MEDICINE" --

20:43.467 --> 20:44.600
JEREMY RENNER'S COLLECTION OF

20:44.667 --> 20:45.734
MUSIC-LIKE NOISES -- FROM THE

20:45.800 --> 20:46.700
INTERNET.

20:46.767 --> 20:47.600
BUT -- AND THIS IS IMPORTANT --

20:47.667 --> 20:49.900
YOU SHOULDN'T.

20:49.967 --> 20:55.166
AND THEN THERE'S THE POTENTIAL

20:55.233 --> 20:55.600
BUSINESS IMPACTS OF

20:55.667 --> 20:55.934
PRIVATIZATION.

20:56.000 --> 20:56.500
SMALL BUSINESSES WOULD

20:56.567 --> 20:58.600
IMMEDIATELY BE AFFECTED IF

20:58.667 --> 21:00.200
SERVICE WAS REDUCED, LIKE THIS

21:00.266 --> 21:00.934
ROCK ENGRAVING COMPANY

21:01.000 --> 21:01.767
IN RURAL KANSAS.

21:01.834 --> 21:02.834
>> FISHER ROCK IS ANOTHER

21:02.900 --> 21:03.734
COMPANY THAT USES THE LOCAL POST

21:03.800 --> 21:04.500
OFFICE TO SHIP SOME OF THEIR

21:04.567 --> 21:05.734
SMALLER PRODUCTS.

21:05.800 --> 21:08.734
>> JUST ABOUT EVERY DAY WE MAIL

21:08.800 --> 21:09.467
OUT SOMETHING.

21:09.533 --> 21:10.467
I HATE TO SEE THEM LOSE OUR POST

21:10.533 --> 21:11.200
OFFICE IN HOME CITY.

21:11.266 --> 21:13.100
IT'S HANDY FOR BUSINESSES LIKE

21:13.166 --> 21:16.300
MYSELF JUST TO RUN IN THERE AND

21:16.367 --> 21:17.133
GET POSTAGE AND -- AND -- AND

21:17.200 --> 21:18.767
MAIL OUT ROCKS.

21:18.834 --> 21:20.633
>> John: YEAH, IT WOULD BE A

21:20.700 --> 21:22.066
REAL SHAME IF THAT BUSINESS

21:22.133 --> 21:24.767
COULDN'T MAIL OUT ITS ROCKS,

21:24.834 --> 21:25.900
LIKE THIS ONE THAT SAYS "REAL

21:25.967 --> 21:27.367
WOMEN HEART LITTLE WIENERS," OR

21:27.433 --> 21:30.100
THIS ONE THAT SAYS "THE GRASS IS

21:30.166 --> 21:31.100
GREENER UNDER MY WIENER."

21:31.166 --> 21:32.567
I MEAN, THAT'S A PERFECT ROCK.

21:32.633 --> 21:34.300
IF THE POSTAL SERVICE STOPPED

21:34.367 --> 21:35.000
DELIVERING GUT BUSTERS LIKE

21:35.066 --> 21:36.367
THAT, IT WOULD BE A FUCKING

21:36.433 --> 21:42.633
TRAGEDY.

21:42.700 --> 21:44.367
ALTHOUGH NOT FOR ME, TO BE

21:44.433 --> 21:45.667
HONEST, SINCE I ALREADY BOUGHT

21:45.734 --> 21:47.667
MINE, AND I'VE GOT TO SAY, IT'S

21:47.734 --> 21:52.400
EVEN FUNNIER IN PERSON.

21:52.467 --> 21:54.266
ONE OF THE FUNNIEST THINGS ABOUT

21:54.333 --> 21:56.567
THIS IS HOW GENUINELY HEAVY IT

21:56.633 --> 21:56.734
IS.

21:56.800 --> 21:57.633
AND IT'S NOT JUST SMALL

21:57.700 --> 21:58.700
BUSINESSES -- COMPANIES LIKE

21:58.767 --> 21:59.266
FEDEX AND UPS OFTEN HAND OFF

21:59.333 --> 22:00.033
THEIR PACKAGES TO THE POSTAL

22:00.100 --> 22:00.667
SERVICE FOR THE LAST LEG OF THE

22:00.734 --> 22:01.266
DELIVERY, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL

22:01.333 --> 22:02.000
AREAS.

22:02.066 --> 22:02.700
AMAZON ALSO CONTRACTS MANY OF

22:02.767 --> 22:03.967
ITS DELIVERIES OUT TO IT.

22:04.033 --> 22:05.300
AND THAT, WEIRDLY ENOUGH, BRINGS

22:05.367 --> 22:06.567
US TO ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS

22:06.633 --> 22:07.934
STANDING IN THE WAY OF THE USPS

22:08.000 --> 22:09.200
GETTING THE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE

22:09.266 --> 22:12.233
IT SO BADLY NEEDS, BECAUSE THIS

22:12.300 --> 22:13.934
GUY HAS STRONGLY OPPOSED GIVING

22:14.000 --> 22:16.333
IT SUFFICIENT AID, AND MANY

22:16.400 --> 22:18.433
BELIEVE THAT'S BECAUSE OF ITS

22:18.500 --> 22:19.967
RELATIONSHIP WITH AMAZON, OWNED,

22:20.033 --> 22:21.800
OF COURSE, BY JEFF BEZOS, WHO

22:21.867 --> 22:23.767
ALSO OWNS "THE WASHINGTON POST,"

22:23.834 --> 22:25.967
WHOSE POLITICAL COVERAGE IS

22:26.033 --> 22:27.066
HATED BY THE PRESIDENT, WHO --

22:27.133 --> 22:28.400
AS WE KNOW -- MAKES POLICY

22:28.467 --> 22:30.333
DECISIONS BASED ON HIS

22:30.400 --> 22:31.533
NEVER-ENDING GAME OF SIX DEGREES

22:31.600 --> 22:33.500
OF "HOW IS THIS ABOUT ME?"

22:33.567 --> 22:34.500
JUST WATCH HIM TRY AND EXPLAIN

22:34.567 --> 22:35.800
WHY THE POSTAL SERVICE SHOULDN'T

22:35.867 --> 22:38.467
GET FEDERAL HELP.

22:38.533 --> 22:42.300
>> THE POSTAL SERVICE IS A JOKE.

22:42.367 --> 22:44.633
BECAUSE THEY'RE HANDING OUT

22:44.700 --> 22:46.700
PACKAGES FOR AMAZON AND OTHER

22:46.767 --> 22:48.200
INTERNET COMPANIES AND EVERY

22:48.266 --> 22:49.667
TIME THEY BRING A PACKAGE, THEY

22:49.734 --> 22:51.200
LOSE MONEY ON IT.

22:51.266 --> 22:52.834
THE POST OFFICE SHOULD RAISE THE

22:52.900 --> 22:54.900
PRICE OF A PACKAGE BY

22:54.967 --> 22:56.333
APPROXIMATELY FOUR TIMES.

22:56.400 --> 22:57.867
BECAUSE THEY DON'T RAISE THEM.

22:57.934 --> 22:59.867
FOR SOME REASON -- THESE PEOPLE

22:59.934 --> 23:02.000
HAVE BEEN IN THERE A LONG TIME.

23:02.066 --> 23:03.867
BUT FOR SOME REASON, THEY'RE

23:03.934 --> 23:06.934
VERY COZY WITH SOME OF THESE

23:07.000 --> 23:08.300
COMPANIES, AND THEY DON'T RAISE

23:08.367 --> 23:12.600
THE PRICE OF A PACKAGE.

23:12.667 --> 23:13.467
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, THE POSTAL

23:13.533 --> 23:15.500
SERVICE IS NOT A JOKE.

23:15.567 --> 23:19.967
IT DELIVERS JOKES, YES, AND THEY

23:20.033 --> 23:21.333
ARE, AS WE KNOW, HILARIOUS, BUT

23:21.400 --> 23:22.100
IT'S NOT, IN ITSELF, A JOKE.

23:22.166 --> 23:22.900
"GREENER UNDER MY WEINER."

23:22.967 --> 23:23.567
THIS IS THE FUNNIEST ROCK OF ALL

23:23.633 --> 23:27.867
TIME.

23:27.934 --> 23:29.000
JESUS CHRIST!

23:29.066 --> 23:30.600
BUT SECOND, IF THE POSTAL

23:30.667 --> 23:31.333
SERVICE QUADRUPLES PRICES ON

23:31.400 --> 23:32.166
COMPANIES, THOSE PACKAGE

23:32.233 --> 23:33.200
DELIVERY COSTS WILL ALMOST

23:33.266 --> 23:34.467
CERTAINLY BE PASSED ON TO THE

23:34.533 --> 23:35.266
CONSUMER, BECAUSE THEY'RE

23:35.333 --> 23:36.533
COMPANIES, AND THEY DON'T GIVE A

23:36.600 --> 23:38.700
SHIT.

23:38.767 --> 23:40.367
AND THIRD, IT ISN'T CUTTING

23:40.433 --> 23:42.834
SWEETHEART DEALS TO LOSE MONEY

23:42.900 --> 23:44.467
ON EVERY DELIVERY, BECAUSE IN

23:44.533 --> 23:45.033
ADDITION TO EVERYTHING ELSE

23:45.100 --> 23:46.700
WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED, THAT

23:46.767 --> 23:48.100
2006 LAW MADE IT ILLEGAL FOR THE

23:48.166 --> 23:49.633
USPS TO PRICE PARCEL DELIVERY

23:49.700 --> 23:54.700
BELOW ITS COST.

23:54.767 --> 24:02.667
SO, IN SUMMATION HERE, TRUMP IS

24:02.734 --> 24:03.533
CONVINCED THAT THE POSTAL

24:03.600 --> 24:04.800
SERVICE'S BIGGEST PROBLEM IS ONE

24:04.867 --> 24:06.166
OF THE FEW THINGS THAT IS NOT

24:06.233 --> 24:06.800
ACTUALLY ONE OF ITS PROBLEMS.

24:06.867 --> 24:07.567
AND THAT'S NOT JUST ANNOYING,

24:07.633 --> 24:08.266
IT'S WORRYING, ESPECIALLY AS,

24:08.333 --> 24:08.967
JUST THIS WEEK, HE REPLACED THE

24:09.033 --> 24:10.300
OUTGOING POSTMASTER GENERAL WITH

24:10.367 --> 24:11.166
THIS GUY, LOUIS DeJOY, A MAJOR

24:11.233 --> 24:13.533
TRUMP DONOR.

24:13.600 --> 24:19.100
AND THAT APPOINTMENT HAS MANY

24:19.166 --> 24:20.433
WORRIED MANY PEOPLE THAT TRUMP

24:20.500 --> 24:21.200
MAY NOW BE ABLE TO BEND THE

24:21.266 --> 24:21.900
POSTAL SERVICE TO HIS

24:21.967 --> 24:22.767
WILL, PRESUMABLY MEANING THAT BY

24:22.834 --> 24:24.233
NEXT YEAR, EVERY STAMP IN

24:24.300 --> 24:26.400
AMERICA WILL FEATURE ONE OF

24:26.467 --> 24:27.367
JEFF BEZOS' DICK PICS.

24:27.433 --> 24:28.533
AND THE THING IS, THERE ARE

24:28.600 --> 24:29.166
ABSOLUTELY SOLUTIONS THAT WOULD

24:29.233 --> 24:30.433
ENABLE THE POSTAL SERVICE TO

24:30.500 --> 24:32.467
HELP THEMSELVES, BUT FOR ALL THE

24:32.533 --> 24:34.033
REASONS THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED,

24:34.100 --> 24:35.200
THEIR HANDS ARE TIED WHEN IT

24:35.266 --> 24:35.900
COMES TO PRICING ON THEIR MAIN

24:35.967 --> 24:38.734
PRODUCT.

24:38.800 --> 24:41.033
WHICH MAY ACTUALLY HELP EXPLAIN

24:41.100 --> 24:41.834
SOME OF THEIR VERY WEIRD SIDE

24:41.900 --> 24:42.300
HUSTLES.

24:42.367 --> 24:43.166
FOR INSTANCE, YOU CAN GO ON

24:43.233 --> 24:45.000
THEIR SITE AND BUY THIS COSTUME

24:45.066 --> 24:46.667
FOR YOUR DOG, WHICH IS A GREAT

24:46.734 --> 24:47.967
WAY TO MAKE YOUR DOG LOOK LIKE

24:48.033 --> 24:48.700
IT'S PERFORMING A POSTAL-THEMED

24:48.767 --> 24:50.166
RENDITION OF "DICK IN A BOX."

24:50.233 --> 24:55.934
ALSO, A FEW YEARS BACK, THEY

24:56.000 --> 24:56.767
ENTERED INTO A BIZARRE

24:56.834 --> 24:57.700
PARTNERSHIP WITH

24:57.767 --> 24:58.734
FOREVER 21 TO UNVEIL A POSTAL

24:58.800 --> 24:59.333
SERVICE-THEMED FASHION LINE.

24:59.400 --> 25:00.200
ALTHOUGH, AS THIS YOUTUBER WILL

25:00.266 --> 25:00.767
TELL YOU, THERE WERE A FEW

25:00.834 --> 25:03.133
ISSUES WITH THEIR GARMENTS:

25:03.200 --> 25:05.433
>> OH, MY GOSH.

25:05.500 --> 25:06.533
WHY -- WHY IS ANY OF THIS

25:06.600 --> 25:07.467
HAPPENING?

25:07.533 --> 25:09.300
IT'S LIKE, YES, I AM A PRIORITY.

25:09.367 --> 25:12.233
MY BOOBS ARE THE PRIORITY.

25:12.300 --> 25:14.033
OVERALL I'M GONNA GIVE IT

25:14.100 --> 25:16.100
A 3.5 OUT OF 10.

25:16.166 --> 25:17.433
>> John: YEAH, WHEN YOU'RE

25:17.500 --> 25:19.900
WEARING NOTHING BUT THE WORD

25:19.967 --> 25:22.133
"PRIORITY" STRETCHED OVER YOUR

25:22.200 --> 25:23.266
CHEST, IT'S WEIRD TO REALIZE THE

25:23.333 --> 25:24.166
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION "WHY IS

25:24.233 --> 25:25.433
ANY OF THIS HAPPENING?" IS, AT

25:25.500 --> 25:26.300
LEAST IN PART, "THE POSTAL

25:26.367 --> 25:27.200
ACCOUNTABILITY AND ENHANCEMENT

25:27.266 --> 25:29.567
ACT OF 2006."

25:29.633 --> 25:31.400
BUT LOOK, BRANCHING OUT INTO

25:31.467 --> 25:32.166
FASHION CLEARLY WON'T SAVE THE

25:32.233 --> 25:35.734
POSTAL SERVICE.

25:35.800 --> 25:36.633
THAT IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT

25:36.700 --> 25:37.900
THAT THEY'RE GIVEN MORE

25:37.967 --> 25:39.600
FLEXIBILITY, NOT JUST ON

25:39.667 --> 25:40.467
PRICING, BUT ALSO ON THE TYPES

25:40.533 --> 25:42.567
OF SERVICES THEY CAN OFFER.

25:42.633 --> 25:44.500
NOW, EXPERTS SUGGEST POST

25:44.567 --> 25:46.033
OFFICES COULD EXPAND THEIR

25:46.100 --> 25:47.200
SERVICES TO ISSUE THINGS LIKE

25:47.266 --> 25:48.600
HUNTING AND FISHING LICENSES.

25:48.667 --> 25:50.667
AND PERHAPS THE BEST OPTION IS

25:50.734 --> 25:52.467
SOMETHING CALLED POSTAL BANKING,

25:52.533 --> 25:53.734
WHERE THE POST OFFICE DOESN'T SO

25:53.800 --> 25:56.300
MUCH ACT AS A BANK AS PROVIDE

25:56.367 --> 25:56.834
SOME VERY BASIC FINANCIAL

25:56.900 --> 25:58.700
SERVICES, LIKE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS

25:58.767 --> 26:00.467
AND CHECK CASHING.

26:00.533 --> 26:01.767
THAT WOULDN'T JUST GENERATE

26:01.834 --> 26:04.066
REVENUE -- IT COULD ALSO HELP

26:04.133 --> 26:09.066
THE ESTIMATED 25% OF PEOPLE

26:09.133 --> 26:10.633
IN THIS COUNTRY LIVING IN

26:10.700 --> 26:11.367
UNBANKED OR UNDERBANKED

26:11.433 --> 26:12.000
COMMUNITIES WHO ARE

26:12.066 --> 26:12.633
OTHERWISE OFTEN FORCED TO TURN

26:12.700 --> 26:13.467
TO ALTERNATIVE FINANCIAL

26:13.533 --> 26:14.367
SERVICES LIKE PAYDAY LENDERS,

26:14.433 --> 26:15.066
WHICH CAN CHARGE UP TO 400% IN

26:15.133 --> 26:16.400
FEES AND INTEREST.

26:16.467 --> 26:17.567
AND THIS WOULDN'T BE COMPLETELY

26:17.633 --> 26:20.266
OUT OF THEIR LANE.

26:20.333 --> 26:21.700
NOT ONLY DO THEY ALREADY PROVIDE

26:21.767 --> 26:23.767
SOME SERVICES, LIKE SELLING

26:23.834 --> 26:25.800
MONEY ORDERS, MONEY TRANSFERS,

26:25.867 --> 26:27.266
AND PREPAID CARDS, BUT UP UNTIL

26:27.333 --> 26:28.867
THE 1960s, THEY WERE ALREADY

26:28.934 --> 26:31.166
DOING IT:

26:31.233 --> 26:33.300
>> THOUGH 90% OF ITS INCOME IS

26:33.367 --> 26:34.867
DERIVED FROM THE SALE OF STAMPS,

26:34.934 --> 26:35.934
THE POST OFFICE IS ALSO THE

26:36.000 --> 26:37.600
LARGEST SAVINGS BANK IN THE

26:37.667 --> 26:38.900
COUNTRY AND THE LARGEST AGENCY

26:38.967 --> 26:40.367
FOR THE TRANSFER OF MONEY.

26:40.433 --> 26:41.700
IT TAKES IN MORE THAN

26:41.767 --> 26:42.800
$1.5 BILLION ANNUALLY.

26:42.867 --> 26:44.600
>> John: YOU KNOW, IT'S

26:44.667 --> 26:46.533
DEPRESSING THAT THE WEIRDEST

26:46.600 --> 26:48.133
THING ABOUT WATCHING OLD-TIMEY

26:48.200 --> 26:49.367
CLIPS NOW ISN'T THAT THEY'RE IN

26:49.433 --> 26:51.166
BLACK AND WHITE OR THAT PEOPLE

26:51.233 --> 26:52.367
ARE WEARING HATS, IT'S THAT

26:52.433 --> 26:53.233
EVERYONE IS STANDING NEXT TO

26:53.300 --> 26:54.533
EACH OTHER IN A PUBLIC PLACE

26:54.600 --> 26:57.166
WITH NO FEAR OF DYING.

26:57.233 --> 26:58.633
HONESTLY, AT THIS POINT, I HAVE

26:58.700 --> 27:00.934
SUCH SEVERE QUARANTINE BRAIN

27:01.000 --> 27:01.700
I COULD WAKE UP IN THE

27:01.767 --> 27:02.600
JURASSIC PERIOD AND MY FIRST

27:02.667 --> 27:06.333
THOUGHT WOULD BE "HOLY SHIT,

27:06.400 --> 27:07.300
THOSE STEGOSAURUSES ARE STANDING

27:07.367 --> 27:09.233
WAY TOO CLOSE TOGETHER.

27:09.300 --> 27:10.300
BUT POSTAL BANKING IS CLEARLY

27:10.367 --> 27:12.300
MORE OF A LONG-TERM SOLUTION --

27:12.367 --> 27:12.934
IT WON'T GET THE USPS OUT OF ITS

27:13.000 --> 27:14.734
CURRENT MESS.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.033
WHAT THEY BADLY NEED IS AN

27:16.100 --> 27:17.667
INFUSION OF FUNDING AS SOON AS

27:17.734 --> 27:19.166
POSSIBLE, AND NOT ONLY SHOULD WE

27:19.233 --> 27:21.166
BE DEMANDING THEY GET THAT,

27:21.233 --> 27:22.900
CONGRESS SHOULD ALSO TAKE A LOOK

27:22.967 --> 27:24.500
AT UNDOING SOME OF THE MORE

27:24.567 --> 27:27.066
ONEROUS TERMS IN THAT 2006 LAW.

27:27.133 --> 27:28.767
AND UNTIL THEN, THERE MIGHT

27:28.834 --> 27:31.367
ACTUALLY BE SOMETHING SMALL WE

27:31.433 --> 27:32.934
CAN DO HERE, BECAUSE THE

27:33.000 --> 27:34.500
PURCHASE OF STAMPS IS STILL A

27:34.567 --> 27:37.333
KEY REVENUE GENERATOR FOR THEM.

27:37.400 --> 27:39.500
AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET STAMPS

27:39.567 --> 27:41.834
MADE.

27:41.900 --> 27:42.600
TV SHOWS HAVE DONE THIS IN

27:42.667 --> 27:43.700
THE PAST.

27:43.767 --> 27:46.867
"AMERICAN IDOL" SOLD STAMPS, AND

27:46.934 --> 27:48.000
"VEEP" AND "FULL FRONTAL"

27:48.066 --> 27:48.967
RECENTLY DID GIVEAWAYS.

27:49.033 --> 27:49.867
AND WHILE IT WILL NOT COME CLOSE

27:49.934 --> 27:52.467
TO RAISING THE $90 BILLION THE

27:52.533 --> 27:53.734
POSTAL SERVICE BADLY NEEDS,

27:53.800 --> 27:54.734
WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING WITH

27:54.800 --> 27:56.266
Stamps.com FOR WEEKS TO NOT

27:56.333 --> 27:57.433
JUST DO A GIVEAWAY, BUT TO

27:57.500 --> 27:58.867
PRODUCE A RUN OF STAMPS THAT ARE

27:58.934 --> 27:59.633
AVAILABLE FOR YOU TO BUY RIGHT

27:59.700 --> 28:02.333
NOW.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.300
IF YOU GO TO

28:04.367 --> 28:05.166
Stamps.com/LastStampTonight, YOU

28:05.233 --> 28:06.834
CAN FIND POSTAGE FEATURING

28:06.900 --> 28:08.400
CHIIJOHN, A BOLIVIAN ZEBRA,

28:08.467 --> 28:09.667
MR. NUTTERBUTTER, AND OUR

28:09.734 --> 28:11.433
PERSONAL FAVORITE,

28:11.500 --> 28:14.066
"AND NOW, A STAMP."

28:14.133 --> 28:15.734
YOU CAN BUY SHEETS OF THESE FOR

28:15.800 --> 28:18.433
THE NEXT MONTH, AND I'D

28:18.500 --> 28:19.967
REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT.

28:20.033 --> 28:20.934
THEY'RE THE PERFECT WAY TO MAIL

28:21.000 --> 28:22.400
A CARD THAT SUPPORTS THE USPS

28:22.467 --> 28:23.800
IN ITS TIME OF NEED WHILE

28:23.867 --> 28:25.333
ALSO SAYING "I LIKE

28:25.400 --> 28:27.266
'LAST WEEK TONIGHT' AND I'M

28:27.333 --> 28:29.767
SORRY I FORGOT MOTHER'S DAY."

28:29.834 --> 28:30.333
WHICH YOU DID, YOU PIECE OF

28:30.400 --> 28:31.400
SHIT.

28:31.467 --> 28:33.166
IF YOU LIKED THIS SEGMENT,

28:33.233 --> 28:34.033
PLEASE BUY A STAMP AND SUPPORT

28:34.100 --> 28:35.066
THE POSTAL SERVICE.

28:35.133 --> 28:36.233
IF YOU HATED IT, BUY ONE ANYWAY

28:36.300 --> 28:37.467
AND MAIL ME A LETTER ABOUT HOW

28:37.533 --> 28:40.233
MUCH I SUCK.

28:40.300 --> 28:42.467
IT'S ALL THE SAME TO THEM.

28:42.533 --> 28:43.033
YOU'D BE DOING A REALLY NICE

28:43.100 --> 28:43.767
THING.

28:43.834 --> 28:44.533
THAT'S OUR SHOW, THANKS SO MUCH

28:44.600 --> 28:45.934
FOR WATCHING, WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT

28:46.000 --> 28:47.400
WEEK, GOOD NIGHT!

28:52.400 --> 28:52.600
IT'S YOU!

28:52.667 --> 28:56.600
I KNOW YOU!

28:56.667 --> 28:58.567
YOU ARE VERY GOOD AT

28:58.633 --> 28:59.633
INTERRUPTING THINGS.
