10:03.367 --> 10:07.834
SOMETIMES AT NIGHT,
I IMAGINE
HE GETS KILLED.

10:09.867 --> 10:10.900
NO, LOOK,

10:10.900 --> 10:13.100
JACK IS
MY BEST FRIEND, OK?

10:13.100 --> 10:15.100
AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE
SURE THAT IF THIS THING
WORKS OUT WITH RACHEL

10:15.100 --> 10:17.400
THAT, YOU KNOW, HE'S
GONNA BE OK WITH IT.

10:17.400 --> 10:19.400
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
IF YOU AND RACHEL REALLY
CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER,

10:19.400 --> 10:22.000
THEN I'M SURE
JACK WILL UNDERSTAND.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.033
REALLY?
DO YOU THINK SO?

10:23.033 --> 10:24.967
I COULDN'T CARE LESS.
NOW GET OUT.

10:24.967 --> 10:26.834
YOU'RE
A GOOD BROTHER, COR.

10:26.834 --> 10:27.867
OUT.

10:27.867 --> 10:29.200
HEY, TOPANGA.

10:29.200 --> 10:32.100
OOH, WHAT'D YOU
BRING, TOYS?

10:34.000 --> 10:38.100
HEY. WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF MY SILK PAJAMAS, HUH?

10:38.100 --> 10:41.667
THEY COST ME $2,000.

10:41.667 --> 10:43.400
THEY'RE NICE.

10:43.400 --> 10:44.900
CORY, WHY ARE THE BEDS
PUSHED TOGETHER?

10:44.900 --> 10:48.133
OH, WELL, WE ARE GONNA
BE LIVING TOGETHER.

10:48.133 --> 10:50.233
I JUST, UH,
ASSUMED THAT--

10:50.233 --> 10:53.000
CORY, YOU AND I
ARE LIVING TOGETHER
TO GET CLOSER AS A COUPLE.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.400
THIS NEEDS TO BE
AN ORDINARY NIGHT

10:54.400 --> 10:56.600
WHERE WE BEHAVE
JUST AS OURSELVES.
NOTHING SPECIAL.

10:56.600 --> 10:59.867
SEX IS THE LAST THING
WE SHOULD BE DOING.

11:00.734 --> 11:03.367
YOU ARE WRONG.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.867
YOU JUST ARE!

11:07.867 --> 11:10.233
BUT I'M LOOKING
VERY FORWARD TO SPENDING
ALL THE NEXT FEW DAYS TOGETHER

11:10.233 --> 11:12.600
GETTING TO KNOW YOU BETTER
THAN I EVER HAVE BEFORE.

11:12.600 --> 11:16.100
HA. WELL, IF I WOULD
HAVE KNOWN WE WERE
JUST GONNA DO THAT,

11:16.100 --> 11:20.200
I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT
THE FLANNEL PAJAMAS
WITH THE FEET...

11:20.200 --> 11:21.934
INSTEAD OF
THE SILK PAJAMAS

11:21.934 --> 11:26.300
AND THE SILK BLANKET
AND THESE SILK SHEETS!

11:32.000 --> 11:33.600
AND NOW I GOT
BLOOD ON THEM!

11:37.300 --> 11:39.900
YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T
BUY THESE, TOO?
DON'T TAKE THOSE OFF!

11:39.900 --> 11:42.667
I DON'T WANT TO SPEND MY LIFE
BEING A HAND-OUT CASE, JACK.

11:42.667 --> 11:44.700
I UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU FEEL.

11:44.700 --> 11:46.100
NO, YOU DON'T!

11:46.100 --> 11:47.133
YOU DON'T.

11:49.400 --> 11:53.000
YOU KNOW, I--I
DON'T EXPECT YOU TO.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.934
YOU KNOW, I--I APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU AND YOUR STEPDAD
ARE DOING FOR ME.

11:57.934 --> 12:01.233
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
ACCEPT IT AND MOVE ON?

12:01.233 --> 12:02.500
MOVE ON FROM WHAT?

12:02.500 --> 12:05.767
NOTHING IS WHAT
I THOUGHT IT WAS.

12:05.767 --> 12:08.200
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I AM ANYMORE.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.667
YOU'RE MY BROTHER

12:10.667 --> 12:12.700
IN HIS UNDERWEAR.

12:16.567 --> 12:19.300
WOULD YOU
PLEASE GET DRESSED?

12:21.567 --> 12:23.934
I'M GONNA PAY YOU BACK
FOR EVERYTHING.

12:23.934 --> 12:25.667
YOU WANNA PAY ME BACK?
I'M GONNA PAY YOU BACK.

12:25.667 --> 12:27.734
LET ME KNOW
WHO MY FATHER WAS.
WHAT?

12:27.734 --> 12:29.667
YEAH. WHY DO YOU THINK
I WANTED TO COME
DOWN HERE SO BADLY?

12:29.667 --> 12:33.667
I WANTED TO FIND OUT
JUST A LITTLE
SOMETHING ABOUT HIM.

12:33.667 --> 12:35.734
YOU ALREADY KNEW MORE
ABOUT HIM THAN I DID.

12:35.734 --> 12:37.300
NO, NO, THE
IMPORTANT STUFF, MAN.

12:37.300 --> 12:39.567
I MEAN, AT LEAST YOU
HAVE MEMORIES WITH HIM.

12:39.567 --> 12:43.734
I MEAN, I WAS GONE
BEFORE I COULD HAVE ANY,
AND NOW HE'S GONE,

12:43.734 --> 12:46.500
AND I GUESS
I'LL NEVER HAVE ANY.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.967
IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING.

12:47.967 --> 12:50.300
HOW?

12:50.300 --> 12:52.567
'CAUSE YOU'RE OK.
YOU'RE THE LUCKY ONE, JACK.

12:52.567 --> 12:57.200
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR YOU TO GO THROUGH
THIS KIND OF PAIN.

13:05.033 --> 13:07.667
[HUMMING]

13:11.300 --> 13:12.233
AAH!

13:14.233 --> 13:17.867
I MEAN, HA,
YOU LOOK NICE.

13:17.867 --> 13:20.767
IT'S FACE CREAM, CORY.
IT KEEPS MY SKIN SOFT.

13:20.767 --> 13:23.100
TAKE IT OFF.
IT SCARES ME.

13:23.100 --> 13:26.033
CORY MATTHEWS
STEPS UP TO THE PLATE,

13:26.033 --> 13:28.867
CLEMENS DIGS IN, CHECKS
THE RUNNER ON FIRST,

13:28.867 --> 13:32.133
DELIVERS THE PITCH,
AND...

13:32.133 --> 13:33.500
OW!
OHH!

13:33.500 --> 13:34.700
WHAT?
OW!

13:34.700 --> 13:37.734
OH, GET IT OFF OF ME!
GET IT OFF OF ME!

13:37.734 --> 13:40.100
OH, TAKE IT EASY,
YOU BABY, IT'S
JUST A TOENAIL.

13:40.100 --> 13:41.300
WHICH TOE?

13:41.300 --> 13:42.867
THE BIG DADDY.

13:42.867 --> 13:44.300
WHEN DID YOU
LAST CLIP IT?

13:44.300 --> 13:45.600
I DON'T KNOW,
A YEAR AGO.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.133
OH, GET IT OFF OF ME.

13:47.133 --> 13:50.367
GET IT--IT'S STUCK IN
MY FACE SOMEWHERE. AAH!

13:50.367 --> 13:52.600
TOPANGA, UH, GOSH,
TAKE IT EASY, YOU BABY.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.700
IT'S JUST HYGIENE.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.500
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, COR,
I WAS SO INTO MY OWN THING,

13:57.500 --> 13:59.100
I FORGOT TO GIVE YOU
A LITTLE BROTHERLY ADVICE

13:59.100 --> 14:01.400
ON THIS WHOLE
LIVING-TOGETHER SITUATION.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.967
UH, THE FIRST THING
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO
IS GET RID OF THE ALIEN.

14:03.967 --> 14:08.300
YOU KNOW, CALL MULDER
AND SCULLY. THEY'LL
KNOW WHAT TO DO.

14:08.300 --> 14:10.900
ERIC, IT'S ME.

14:10.900 --> 14:13.200
PANGY? DANG, GIRL,
YOU LOOK BAD.

14:13.200 --> 14:17.000
OH, AND YOU GOT A TOENAIL
RIGHT HERE. LOOK AT THAT.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.600
GROUND RULE DOUBLE?

14:18.600 --> 14:20.600
YEAH, OFF
THE GREEN MONSTER.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.667
ALL RIGHT! HEY,
I'M UP, I'M UP, I'M UP!

14:22.667 --> 14:23.667
GET OUT OF HERE!

14:23.667 --> 14:25.500
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.133
I HAVE MY LITTLE KUMQUAT
AT HOME, NO BIG DEAL.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.100
BUT I DO WANT TO DO
THIS BEFORE I LEAVE.

14:29.100 --> 14:31.233
[HUMMING]

14:35.500 --> 14:38.967
ALL RIGHT, PEACE.
I'M OUT, ALL RIGHT.

14:40.867 --> 14:44.300
CORY, EVEN THAT
KNOWS YOU BETTER THAN I DO.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.100
OH, RELAX. IT'S JUST
BECAUSE ERIC AND I
HAVE LIVED TOGETHER.

14:47.100 --> 14:49.300
MAYBE THIS WASN'T
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

14:49.300 --> 14:50.400
NO, NO, NO, IT IS.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.367
LISTEN, ANYTIME
YOU AND I ARE TOGETHER,

14:52.367 --> 14:54.300
IT IS
ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA.

14:54.300 --> 14:55.834
OK. I'M JUST GONNA
GO WASH MY FACE.

14:55.834 --> 14:57.100
MAYBE THEN
WE CAN GO TO SLEEP.

14:57.100 --> 14:59.200
YEAH, I'M JUST GONNA
GET READY FOR BED.

14:59.200 --> 15:00.767
OK.

THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH.

16:21.934 --> 16:22.967
YOU KNOW WHY?

16:22.967 --> 16:24.500
WHY?

16:24.500 --> 16:27.000
BECAUSE I WANT TO CHANGE
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.934
OH, HEY, RACH.

16:34.934 --> 16:36.567
HEY, JACK.

16:36.567 --> 16:39.400
SO, HOW'D IT GO
DOWN AT THE TRAILER PARK?

16:39.400 --> 16:40.934
SHAWN CAME DOWN.

16:40.934 --> 16:43.400
HE DID? WELL,
THAT'S--THAT'S GREAT.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.700
IS HE OK?

16:45.700 --> 16:49.600
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
OH, I HOPE SO.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.900
WELL, HOW ABOUT YOU?

16:51.900 --> 16:54.934

YOU KNOW, I JUST--
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HIM.

17:05.133 --> 17:07.567
I KNOW. I KNOW,
IT'S OK, IT'S OK.

17:07.567 --> 17:10.600
NO. YOU KNOW, IT'S, UM,

IT'S JUST THAT I'M TRYING
REAL HARD NOT TO GET...

17:14.767 --> 17:18.033
IN THE WAY OF HIS--
OF HIS GRIEF.

17:18.033 --> 17:22.900
BUT I'LL JUST--
I'LL NEVER GET
TO KNOW MY REAL DAD.

17:22.900 --> 17:26.767
I KNOW, JACK, BUT YOU
CAN'T KEEP THIS INSIDE.
YOU JUST CAN'T.

17:26.767 --> 17:28.700
YES, I CAN.

17:31.767 --> 17:34.000
IT'S OK, IT'S OK.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
IT'S OK.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.567

18:19.567 --> 18:21.867
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

18:21.867 --> 18:23.800
HEY.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.400
THANKS FOR LETTING ME
HAVE THE ROOM LAST NIGHT.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.600
NO SWEAT. SO?

18:27.600 --> 18:31.834
SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THE BEST PART ABOUT
BEING A VIRGIN IS?

18:31.834 --> 18:34.600
WHAT?
NO, I'M ASKING.

18:36.133 --> 18:37.667
SO HOW YOU DOING?
YOU OK?

18:37.667 --> 18:40.133
I'VE BEEN SO ANGRY,
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO SEE STRAIGHT.

18:40.133 --> 18:42.033
YEAH,
I KINDA NOTICED.

18:42.033 --> 18:44.800
BUT NOW THAT ANGELA'S
NOT IN MY LIFE ANYMORE,
MY DAD'S GONE,

18:44.800 --> 18:48.000
I FIGURE IT'S A GOOD CHANCE
FOR ME TO GET OUT OF HERE.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.600
YEAH, DEFINITELY.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.500
I MEAN, UM,

18:51.500 --> 18:54.000
YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE HANGING AROUND
IN THIS TRAILER.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
SO COME BACK TO THE DORM,
YOU KNOW. WE'LL TALK.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.200
YOU AND TOPANGA AREN'T
LIVING TOGETHER ANYMORE?

18:59.200 --> 19:02.400
YEAH, BUT
ONLY DURING THE DAY.
AT NIGHT, SHE'S SCARY.

19:02.400 --> 19:06.033
BUT, UH, I LOVE HER,
AND WE HAVE OUR WHOLE
LIVES TO LIVE TOGETHER

19:06.033 --> 19:07.734
AND KNOW EACH OTHER.

19:07.734 --> 19:09.100
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU, CORY.

19:09.100 --> 19:10.700
THANK YOU.

19:10.700 --> 19:14.900
BUT I THINK I NEED TO
BREAK AWAY FOR A WHILE,
CLEAR MY HEAD,

19:14.900 --> 19:16.734
FIND OUT WHO I AM.

19:16.734 --> 19:20.200
SHAWN, YOU JUST
LOST YOUR FATHER.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.500
HE LEFT ME THIS TRAILER.
IT'S ALL HE HAD.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.500
EVENTUALLY, I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO SELL IT OFF

19:26.500 --> 19:28.200
AND START PAYING BACK
SOME DEBTS,

19:28.200 --> 19:30.600
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,
I WAS GOING TO HITCH IT UP
AND HIT THE OPEN ROAD.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.567
THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU'D COME WITH ME.

19:32.567 --> 19:35.033
WHAT, YOU MEAN
FOR THE WEEKEND?

19:35.033 --> 19:38.500
YEAH, FOR THE WEEKEND.

WE'RE YOUNG,
WE'RE WILD.

19:44.467 --> 19:45.767
CAN I DRIVE?
NO.

19:45.767 --> 19:48.367
ALL RIGHT, BUT
I GOT SHOTGUN.

19:57.400 --> 20:00.967
SHAWN, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY IT WAS SO IMPORTANT
THAT WE COME HERE.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.467
I WANT TO SAY
GOOD-BYE TO TOPANGA.

20:02.467 --> 20:03.700
YEAH, BUT WE'RE GOING
AWAY FOR THE WEEKEND.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.400
I'M NOT EVEN SAYING
GOOD-BYE TO HER.

20:05.400 --> 20:06.934
WE'RE HERE, OK?

20:06.934 --> 20:09.233
OK, BUT I WOULDN'T
GO IN THERE.

20:09.233 --> 20:10.600
I'M JUST
SAYING GOOD-BYE.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.300
SHERYL SWOOPES
DRIBBLES DOWN THE LANE.

20:12.300 --> 20:15.300
SHE SQUARES OFF
TO THE BASKET, SHOOTS!

20:15.300 --> 20:16.400
OW!

20:16.400 --> 20:18.867
SCORES! WHOO-HOO!

20:18.867 --> 20:20.500
WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT?

20:20.500 --> 20:22.867
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL,
ISN'T SHE?

20:24.300 --> 20:26.600
SHE LOOKS LIKE
THE SWAMP THING.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.000
I KNOW. LET'S GO.

20:32.033 --> 20:33.867
GOOD-BYE, TOPANGA.
