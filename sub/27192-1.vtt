- Good evening.
- Good evening.

07:28.965 --> 07:30.208
- Are you
Professor Herman?

07:30.208 --> 07:31.312
- I am indeed, it's
nice to meet you.

07:31.312 --> 07:32.555
- Yeah nice to meet you.

07:32.555 --> 07:34.695
Sorry we're late, we
got lost on the way.

07:34.695 --> 07:37.457
It's a really small village,
and there were no signs.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.529
- It's true there's not very
much civilization out here.

07:40.529 --> 07:41.875
Problem with it is
it's the last refuge

07:41.875 --> 07:43.393
before the mountains.

07:43.393 --> 07:44.947
But, I'm glad you've
arrived safely.

07:44.947 --> 07:46.258
- Thanks.

07:46.258 --> 07:47.777
- You must be David.

07:47.777 --> 07:49.572
- Yeah that's me, nice
to meet you professor Herman.

07:49.572 --> 07:51.471
- Oh please, call me Gunter.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.817
Can I help you with your bags?

07:52.817 --> 07:53.749
- No, it's okay.

07:53.749 --> 07:55.233
- You sure?
- Yeah.

07:55.233 --> 07:56.130
- Okay well let's grab
this stuff and get inside,

07:56.130 --> 07:57.166
it's bloody freezing.

07:58.443 --> 08:00.410
- Thank you for putting
us up for the night.

08:00.410 --> 08:02.378
- I should be thanking you.

08:02.378 --> 08:03.862
This is a very unusual case.

08:05.036 --> 08:07.383
It's great that we've
got media coverage.

08:07.383 --> 08:09.765
David, I have to apologize
I don't speak French.

08:11.145 --> 08:13.078
It's a bit embarrassing really
for an English scientist

08:13.078 --> 08:15.874
working on the French-Swiss
border, but all us English

08:15.874 --> 08:17.980
we're not renowned for
speaking languages.

08:20.430 --> 08:21.639
Come on in.

08:21.639 --> 08:23.019
- It's okay, David
and I speak English.

08:23.019 --> 08:26.229
- Yeah I understand
English, but sorry

08:26.229 --> 08:28.162
I have a very bad accent.

08:28.162 --> 08:29.785
- Well I can
understand everything.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.065
This is a pretty cool
place, we've got researchers

08:34.065 --> 08:36.239
from Switzerland,
France, Germany.

08:36.239 --> 08:38.102
It's a cosmopolitan place.

08:38.102 --> 08:41.797
We've been collecting
samples now for over a week.

08:41.797 --> 08:44.731
So we setup this
self-sufficient research camp.

08:44.731 --> 08:46.526
It's up in the mountains.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.355
We're trying to find out
why there's been a drop

08:48.355 --> 08:51.772
of temperature and micro-climate
in this particular area.

08:52.980 --> 08:54.430
- Do you think it
has anything to do

08:54.430 --> 08:56.777
with the cattle disappearance?

08:56.777 --> 08:58.745
- I do yes.

08:58.745 --> 09:02.127
I mean the problem with these
unusual weather conditions

09:02.127 --> 09:03.508
is that sometimes it
can actually affect

09:03.508 --> 09:05.993
even the other side
of the mountain.

09:05.993 --> 09:08.064
It can alter the
environment completely.

09:08.927 --> 09:13.104
- Like a climate anomaly.

09:13.104 --> 09:16.625
Is that why people are talking
about this virus spreading?

09:17.557 --> 09:19.110
- You've heard about the virus.

09:20.249 --> 09:23.252
Well probably it's
the glaciers melting,

09:23.252 --> 09:25.944
and yet the temperature's
remaining abnormally low

09:25.944 --> 09:28.775
especially on one of the
sites just over here.

09:30.052 --> 09:33.227
We've discovered this
new bacterial strain.

09:33.227 --> 09:35.160
Now it's very different
from any other bacteria

09:35.160 --> 09:37.059
we've seen on the glacier.

09:37.059 --> 09:39.855
It's the same species
that's for sure,

09:39.855 --> 09:43.928
but it has a minor difference,
and it's mutating fast.

09:43.928 --> 09:45.999
We just don't know
what it is yet.

09:45.999 --> 09:48.691
Now we think it might be
a new virus developing

09:48.691 --> 09:50.520
as the glacier is melting,
and they're saying now

09:50.520 --> 09:52.315
that it can be
extremely contagious

09:52.315 --> 09:54.697
especially when the
temperatures are really low.

09:55.871 --> 09:59.391
- And this new virus is
infecting the animals?

09:59.391 --> 10:02.636
- There's no proof that the
bacteria is actually harmful.

10:02.636 --> 10:05.708
But what if, the animals
had inhaled it a while ago

10:05.708 --> 10:06.985
without us knowing?

10:06.985 --> 10:09.229
- And this bacteria
made them disappear?

10:09.229 --> 10:11.680
- The guys in the camp, they're
doing everything they can

10:11.680 --> 10:15.718
to find out why they're
having these disappearances.

10:15.718 --> 10:17.547
Have you heard about
the horse carcass?

10:17.547 --> 10:19.308
- Yeah, yeah it's scary.

10:20.723 --> 10:24.554
So the criminal act suspicions
hasn't been ruled out then.

10:24.554 --> 10:26.280
What do the experts think?

10:26.280 --> 10:28.593
- Discovery of a horse
carcass, I don't think

10:28.593 --> 10:31.527
has anything to do with
our case or our studies.

10:31.527 --> 10:33.667
I just think it's one
of those isolated cases.

10:37.464 --> 10:39.224
- Where are the others?

10:39.224 --> 10:41.675
When's the rest of
the team coming?

10:41.675 --> 10:43.228
- I don't know.

10:43.228 --> 10:44.747
They were supposed to be
back here a few days ago.

10:44.747 --> 10:47.060
- We haven't been able to
get in touch with them.

10:47.060 --> 10:50.511
We can't establish any
radio contact with the base.

10:50.511 --> 10:52.479
- Melissa, David,
let me introduce you

10:52.479 --> 10:53.825
to Blake Turner.

10:53.825 --> 10:55.793
He's a police investigator
from Colorado.

10:55.793 --> 10:56.828
- Nice to meet you Melissa.

10:56.828 --> 10:57.691
- Nice to meet you.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.244
- David, how are you?

10:59.244 --> 11:00.763
- Nice to meet you.

11:00.763 --> 11:02.592
- You're just in
time for dinner my friend.

11:02.592 --> 11:04.008
- Sounds good, what's on?

11:05.699 --> 11:06.562
- Okay?

11:06.562 --> 11:08.081
- Hmm, really good.

11:08.081 --> 11:08.909
- Cheesy enough?

11:08.909 --> 11:09.910
- Yeah.

11:09.910 --> 11:11.325
- Yeah it's very nice.

11:11.325 --> 11:12.154
- Cool.

11:13.949 --> 11:15.295
- What are you filming for?

11:16.710 --> 11:19.540
- Making a documentary about
the case, it's French TV.

11:19.540 --> 11:21.646
- Yeah, it's our first big case,

11:21.646 --> 11:23.924
and we wanna collect as
many reports as possible.

11:23.924 --> 11:25.857
- Okay.

11:25.857 --> 11:28.032
- What are we gonna do though
if there's no one to interview

11:28.032 --> 11:29.481
in the refuge?

11:29.481 --> 11:30.586
- That's a good point.

11:32.001 --> 11:33.175
It's looks like you might
have to go up to the top

11:33.175 --> 11:35.142
of the mountain to
interview them up there.

11:35.142 --> 11:36.557
- Okay.

11:36.557 --> 11:37.420
- For some bizarre
reason, something must be

11:37.420 --> 11:38.905
keeping them up there.

11:38.905 --> 11:40.561
And, if the radio
is not working,

11:40.561 --> 11:42.771
we can't contact them anymore.

11:42.771 --> 11:45.359
We don't know if they've
decided to come back

11:45.359 --> 11:47.948
without even telling us,
which could be the case.

11:49.122 --> 11:51.641
Or, whether they've
decided to stay up there

11:51.641 --> 11:53.713
and wait for supplies.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.128
- Supplies?

11:55.128 --> 11:56.785
- There is a helicopter
that makes a supply run

11:56.785 --> 11:59.339
every two weeks,
food, provisions,

11:59.339 --> 12:01.893
shuttles people back and forth.

12:01.893 --> 12:03.792
Last run was four days ago.

12:03.792 --> 12:06.415
Pilot said everything
was fine at that point.

12:06.415 --> 12:07.761
- A few of the scientists
were supposed to be back

12:07.761 --> 12:09.280
a few days ago.

12:09.280 --> 12:12.179
The pilot said that there
was nothing really unusual.

12:12.179 --> 12:14.319
We only lost contact
this morning.

12:14.319 --> 12:17.288
- Okay so why are we going
if they're coming back then?

12:17.288 --> 12:19.877
- It's already been four days.

12:19.877 --> 12:22.569
Only takes a day to
get up there in a jeep,

12:22.569 --> 12:24.364
all the jeeps are up there.

12:24.364 --> 12:25.848
Should have been back by now.

12:25.848 --> 12:26.676
- You're leaving for the
camp tomorrow, aren't you?

12:26.676 --> 12:28.057
- Right, yeah.

12:28.057 --> 12:31.026
- He taking an English biologist
and the mountain guide.

12:31.026 --> 12:31.854
- Daniel.

12:31.854 --> 12:33.373
- Daniel right.

12:33.373 --> 12:34.754
So what we'll do is we'll give
you some of the extra parts

12:34.754 --> 12:35.927
for the radio.

12:35.927 --> 12:37.204
It's really, really
cold up there,

12:37.204 --> 12:39.379
maybe the circuits to
the radio are frozen.

12:40.242 --> 12:44.453
- Okay, maybe we could follow.

12:44.453 --> 12:47.007
We could shoot some pretty
nice footage on the way.

12:48.181 --> 12:51.632
- Well um, okay, happy
to have you along.

12:53.082 --> 12:55.257
- How long does
it take to get up there?

12:55.257 --> 12:58.294
- Um, I don't know it's about
three or four days or so.

12:58.294 --> 12:59.675
- Three days?
- Yeah.

13:01.228 --> 13:03.058
- And, are you sure it's safe?

13:03.058 --> 13:04.714
- Yeah.
- It's safe.

13:04.714 --> 13:07.062
- Blake, Daniel, they
can take the tents.

13:07.062 --> 13:09.305
We're obviously gonna have
to camp up in the cold,

13:09.305 --> 13:10.893
windy mountains.

13:12.481 --> 13:13.965
Nah, you'll be fine.

13:13.965 --> 13:16.278
A few days in the snow, a
few nights, no big deal.

13:16.278 --> 13:17.935
You have winter coats
if you need them?

13:17.935 --> 13:19.005
- Hmm-mm.
- Okay.

13:20.385 --> 13:24.217
Good, anybody care
for some Swiss cheese?

13:24.217 --> 13:26.184
- Hmm, yeah.

13:26.184 --> 13:31.189
- Sure.
- I'd love some.

14:02.082 --> 14:03.670
- Look who's filming already.

14:04.671 --> 14:05.845
Sleep well?

14:05.845 --> 14:08.157
- Yes, I
slept very good, thanks.

14:08.157 --> 14:09.987
- It is the
first day of hiking,

14:09.987 --> 14:11.402
we've got a good one
ahead of us today.

14:11.402 --> 14:12.610
Good morning.

14:12.610 --> 14:13.991
- Good morning.
- Blake.

14:13.991 --> 14:15.647
- Daniel.
- I'm Lori-Ann.

14:15.647 --> 14:17.926
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Blake.

14:17.926 --> 14:18.788
- Daniel.

14:29.213 --> 14:34.218
- Uhm,
shouldn't we be roped up?

14:39.119 --> 14:40.880
- You just
walk behind me.

14:59.174 --> 15:01.762
- Well, Detective Turner.
- Yeah?

15:03.109 --> 15:04.489
- What's an
American investigator doing

15:04.489 --> 15:06.560
in the French mountains?

15:06.560 --> 15:07.389
- Investigating.

15:10.392 --> 15:13.326
There have been similar cases
of animal disappearances

15:13.326 --> 15:15.293
in the US over
the past 10 years.

15:17.157 --> 15:19.056
I've been investigating
the Snoopy Case,

15:19.056 --> 15:20.920
happened in Colorado in '67,

15:20.920 --> 15:22.922
I don't suppose you
ever heard of it.

15:24.268 --> 15:25.476
You ever heard of
the Snoopy Case?

15:25.476 --> 15:27.236
- No no, what
is the Snoopy Case?

15:28.824 --> 15:31.931
- Snoopy was a horse
who went missing.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.693
His owner saw he had meat
in his daily rations.

15:35.693 --> 15:38.730
They found him a quarter
mile away from the ranch.

15:38.730 --> 15:41.975
Skin, hide on his
shoulders, neck, skull,

15:41.975 --> 15:45.634
been torn off, his skull
was cleanly exposed,

15:45.634 --> 15:47.084
it was terrible.

15:47.084 --> 15:50.535
The bushes around the
carcass, they found

15:50.535 --> 15:51.951
they were flattened.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.022
They found his mane
about 50 yards off.

15:55.471 --> 15:57.887
- Wow, so you
came to which conclusion?

15:59.061 --> 16:01.408
- I haven't come to
any conclusion yet.

16:01.408 --> 16:03.341
The investigation
is still ongoing.

16:03.341 --> 16:07.587
- Actually all the blood,
organ, cerebral spinal fluids,

16:07.587 --> 16:09.520
and brain tissues were all gone.

16:13.179 --> 16:15.319
The full autopsy
conducted one month later

16:15.319 --> 16:16.976
was inconclusive.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.564
The forensics said
there was nothing

16:19.564 --> 16:22.567
particularly odd about
all the organs being gone,

16:23.396 --> 16:24.742
could be scavengers.

16:24.742 --> 16:26.157
- Really?

16:32.163 --> 16:34.648
- For him, the blood
just coagulated

16:34.648 --> 16:36.754
and the bone tissues
decompose naturally.

16:37.927 --> 16:39.446
I just love that case.

16:39.446 --> 16:40.792
- Yeah, I can see that.

16:42.208 --> 16:45.349
- You know that there was
this butchered horse carcass

16:45.349 --> 16:47.868
found in the area
a few days ago.

16:47.868 --> 16:49.594
Do you think it died
in the same conditions

16:49.594 --> 16:51.803
as this Snoopy Case?

16:51.803 --> 16:54.634
- Oh, I conducted the autopsy,

16:54.634 --> 16:57.016
and I found some
similarities with Snoopy.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.293
- Really?

16:58.293 --> 17:00.433
- Yeah, there were
signs of infection

17:00.433 --> 17:03.263
on the left flank of the
horse, just like Snoopy had.

17:03.263 --> 17:07.785
And, the skin next to the
shoulder had been sectioned.

17:07.785 --> 17:09.614
I guess someone might
have cut its throat

17:09.614 --> 17:11.582
to put an end to his agony.

17:11.582 --> 17:12.721
- Jesus.

17:12.721 --> 17:13.617
- Yeah.

17:14.516 --> 17:19.521
Thank you.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.874
- Hey, Lori-Ann.
- Hey.

18:02.874 --> 18:04.738
- You are a biologist
specializing

18:04.738 --> 18:06.844
in animal biology, aren't you?

18:06.844 --> 18:07.879
- Yes I am.

18:09.157 --> 18:11.780
I've learned a couple of
points of cell biology.

18:13.092 --> 18:16.716
My thing is definitely
zoology and animal physiology.

18:18.131 --> 18:21.962
But, I'm also interested in
neuroscience and ecology.

18:24.793 --> 18:27.002
- Do you think this is
a criminal case then?

18:28.383 --> 18:30.178
- Well, it's highly likely.

18:32.490 --> 18:34.906
Snoopy's carcass was
examined by a private vet.

18:37.461 --> 18:41.258
He said that Snoopy had
been shot and then threw

18:41.258 --> 18:42.466
himself on barb wires.

18:43.570 --> 18:45.124
The same might
have happened here.

18:47.056 --> 18:49.818
Human intervention, be careful.

18:51.716 --> 18:55.720
Human intervention was
pretty obvious in '67,

18:55.720 --> 18:57.895
but they were never
really able to explain why

18:57.895 --> 19:00.587
there were the traces
around the carcass.

19:00.587 --> 19:03.383
- Do you think little
green men did it?

19:04.315 --> 19:06.145
- You might have
something there.

19:07.525 --> 19:09.044
I've seen some
pretty strange cases

19:09.044 --> 19:11.150
of animal mutilation
these past 10 years.

19:12.565 --> 19:15.878
Last year, Copper Cove, Texas.

19:17.225 --> 19:19.882
Locals say they saw a
bright orange flashing light

19:21.056 --> 19:23.265
near the spot where they
found a mutilated cat.

19:26.268 --> 19:28.788
30 yard circumference
around the cat.

19:30.099 --> 19:32.688
The vegetation was
flattened as if it was blown

19:32.688 --> 19:36.175
flat by a jet engine
or rocket engine,

19:36.175 --> 19:39.005
and then there were other
flattened leaf shapes

19:39.005 --> 19:41.628
in the vegetation
around that area.

19:41.628 --> 19:43.596
Very, very odd.

19:43.596 --> 19:48.601
- Yeah, I heard about the
same year in Wisconsin.

19:48.601 --> 19:51.880
A cow was found dead in an
area of flattened vegetation.

19:53.226 --> 19:56.471
The neck was broken, external
organs had been removed.

19:56.471 --> 19:58.438
Tongue and naval
had been cut out.

19:58.438 --> 20:00.337
But, they couldn't
find any blood.

20:07.551 --> 20:08.759
- Get this thing off me.

20:09.898 --> 20:11.520
- Help me.

20:11.520 --> 20:16.525
- Yeah, thanks.

20:26.466 --> 20:27.916
- Thanks, cheers.

21:19.657 --> 21:24.662
- What do you say we stop here
for the night, set up camp?

21:25.387 --> 21:26.492
It's getting cloudy.

21:26.492 --> 21:27.976
- You're right Mr. Turner.

21:29.426 --> 21:31.428
- Are we
stopping here for the night?

21:31.428 --> 21:32.636
- Yeah, seems like it.

21:32.636 --> 21:35.432
- Good, I can't feel
my feet anymore.

21:35.432 --> 21:38.227
- I know
what you mean.

21:50.343 --> 21:53.104
- I'll take the second
pole when it's ready.

21:53.104 --> 21:55.003
Second pole, thank you.

23:05.245 --> 23:07.282
- Thank you.

23:07.282 --> 23:09.664
Well that's clever.

23:09.664 --> 23:11.700
Chemical friction
warms up the bag.

23:11.700 --> 23:14.393
You can't stop science, can you?

23:38.313 --> 23:40.384
- Thank you, here you go.

23:40.384 --> 23:41.420
That's great.

24:32.712 --> 24:34.334
- Great, thank you!

24:39.408 --> 24:41.203
- Good night.

24:41.203 --> 24:42.895
- I hope that will warm us up.

24:42.895 --> 24:45.345
It's only the first night,
and I'm already freezing.

24:45.345 --> 24:47.934
- Yeah, I know, and
it's just the beginning.

24:47.934 --> 24:49.591
It'll be worse in Cold Ground.

24:50.972 --> 24:52.042
- What's Cold Ground?

24:53.181 --> 24:54.285
- Gunter
didn't tell you?

24:54.285 --> 24:55.528
- No.

24:55.528 --> 24:57.565
- That's what they call
it, that camp up there.

24:57.565 --> 24:58.427
- Why?

24:58.427 --> 24:59.394
- There you go.

24:59.394 --> 25:00.222
Thank you.

25:01.603 --> 25:03.812
Because that's the coldest
place in the mountain.

25:04.986 --> 25:06.401
Nobody knows why,
but the ground there

25:06.401 --> 25:11.337
is frozen all the time
and recent soil samples

25:11.337 --> 25:14.202
indicate really, really low
temperatures for the season.

25:15.583 --> 25:17.999
If I were you David, I
would turn that camera off

25:17.999 --> 25:21.036
because with that cold your
batteries are gonna die

25:21.036 --> 25:22.521
like that.

25:22.521 --> 25:23.349
- Yeah true.

26:03.769 --> 26:05.874
- Go back to sleep.

26:05.874 --> 26:07.600
It's probably just an owl.

26:08.774 --> 26:10.499
The mountain's full
of life you know.

26:11.880 --> 26:15.470
Just turn those lights
off and go back to sleep.

26:24.686 --> 26:27.275
- Yeah
let's do that first.

26:27.275 --> 26:30.450
What's this corner
you got there?

26:30.450 --> 26:32.936
Ah, you wanna help me hold it?

26:43.187 --> 26:44.119
- Good morning.

26:45.327 --> 26:46.156
- Sleep okay?

26:50.229 --> 26:52.507
- Yeah kinda hard to
sleep in with the cold

26:52.507 --> 26:53.335
getting you, huh?

26:55.924 --> 26:57.546
- Sleep
how, I was so cold.

26:57.546 --> 26:58.651
Good morning.

26:58.651 --> 27:01.274
- How you doing?
- Good morning.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.492
- I have here a breakfast
if any of you fancy some.

27:12.492 --> 27:17.497
- Yeah!

27:20.017 --> 27:20.949
- Hey check this out!

27:20.949 --> 27:22.986
I found something over here!

27:22.986 --> 27:23.814
Come here!

27:49.668 --> 27:50.634
- Do you think
a wolf could've done it

27:50.634 --> 27:51.497
during the night?

27:53.119 --> 27:55.501
- It looks awfully
like a dear bone.

27:55.501 --> 27:57.814
A fox might've left it here.

29:15.477 --> 29:17.065
- You okay?
- Yeah.

29:53.308 --> 29:55.241
What's your thought about
this bacteria strain

29:55.241 --> 29:56.484
in the glacier?

29:56.484 --> 30:00.177
- Well, there might be
a virus strain up there.

30:01.592 --> 30:04.388
But, I do believe that
the bacteria is harmless.

30:04.388 --> 30:07.736
I mean a little bacterial
anomaly cannot mutilate

30:07.736 --> 30:09.048
an animal like that.

30:09.048 --> 30:11.602
- That's what I'm
here to find out.

30:11.602 --> 30:12.811
- Did the
French government pay

30:12.811 --> 30:14.088
for you to come here,
of did you come here

30:14.088 --> 30:15.537
by your own means,
out of curiosity?

30:15.537 --> 30:16.987
- Yeah, a little of both.

30:17.885 --> 30:18.747
They helped.

30:19.956 --> 30:22.544
But, this is similar
to cases I'm working on

30:22.544 --> 30:23.476
back home.

30:23.476 --> 30:24.650
So it's kind of personal to me.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.710
- We stop here for today.
- Okay.

31:26.160 --> 31:26.988
- Okay boss.

31:35.410 --> 31:38.551
- Oh god, I'm
freezing my bum off.

31:38.551 --> 31:41.623
Do you still have some of
those magic hot bags left?

31:43.142 --> 31:44.730
Oh yeah, thank you.

33:34.219 --> 33:38.844
- So Melissa, tell me how
long have you been working

33:38.844 --> 33:39.672
as a journalist?

33:41.985 --> 33:46.162
- Well I graduated last
year, and David's been

33:46.162 --> 33:48.060
doing this for
two years already.

33:48.992 --> 33:50.338
- Well done.

33:50.338 --> 33:52.168
Your cameraman's
surely good looking.

33:53.376 --> 33:56.172
- Yeah, well we've been
together for five years,

33:56.172 --> 33:58.277
and I couldn't dream
of a better colleague.

33:59.692 --> 34:01.349
- And, no sound man then?

34:01.349 --> 34:03.696
- No, we're working
with the best equipment.

34:04.939 --> 34:07.424
We're shooting with
this new audio camera.

34:07.424 --> 34:08.701
- Okay.

34:08.701 --> 34:10.909
- So no need to record
the sound separately.

34:10.909 --> 34:12.395
- Okay.

34:16.123 --> 34:20.023
- Hey Lori-Ann,
come take a look.

34:22.577 --> 34:23.889
I found something up here.

34:52.331 --> 34:54.885
What the hell kind
of animal did this?

35:07.001 --> 35:09.348
- Look at that,
that gash on the flank.

35:09.348 --> 35:10.763
It's huge.

35:10.763 --> 35:12.110
- A very
sharp object made that

35:12.110 --> 35:13.697
or sharp claws.

35:13.697 --> 35:14.940
- Whose?

35:14.940 --> 35:17.115
- Skulls been
scalped, scalped clean.

35:18.219 --> 35:19.496
- Do birds
of prey do that?

35:19.496 --> 35:21.153
- No, we're up
too high, and the cuts

35:21.153 --> 35:22.568
are too precise.

35:22.568 --> 35:23.811
Cuts on the scalp too.

35:25.019 --> 35:27.677
Brain's still intact,
get a picture of that.

35:27.677 --> 35:30.058
- Yeah.
- It's frozen.

35:30.058 --> 35:34.270
- Daniel, you've got
the radioactive detector.

35:34.270 --> 35:35.409
- EMF?

35:35.409 --> 35:37.307
- EMF, exactly.

35:41.760 --> 35:44.832
- Do you think it'll show
signs of radioactivity?

35:44.832 --> 35:46.799
- Yeah well I found
some around Snoopy's remains,

35:46.799 --> 35:48.146
0.5%.

35:50.320 --> 35:52.046
- How
is that possible?

35:52.046 --> 35:53.668
- Well I don't
know, you tell me.

35:56.775 --> 35:58.570
A low radioactive reading.

35:58.570 --> 35:59.743
I can't tell whether it's
coming from the animal

35:59.743 --> 36:01.020
or the ground.

36:01.020 --> 36:03.091
- I can't believe it,
a dead radioactive cow

36:03.091 --> 36:04.334
in the middle of nowhere.

36:50.035 --> 36:51.347
- Lori-Ann what do you
say we take that cow

36:51.347 --> 36:52.520
down with us on
our way back down?

36:52.520 --> 36:53.728
- I don't think so.

36:55.627 --> 36:57.767
By the time we get back,
it'll be covered in snow,

36:57.767 --> 36:59.355
eaten by foxes.
- You're right.

37:01.840 --> 37:04.222
- The only working
materials that we have now

37:04.222 --> 37:06.845
are pictures I took I'm afraid.

37:06.845 --> 37:09.227
- Pictures, and your film.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.469
- You're right.

37:10.469 --> 37:11.677
- Anyway, I wasn't
looking forward

37:11.677 --> 37:13.161
to carrying it up on my back.

37:14.887 --> 37:16.061
Here, up you go.

37:17.304 --> 37:18.719
- Thanks.

37:36.288 --> 37:37.979
- Daniel to Pine Wood.

37:37.979 --> 37:39.326
Daniel to Pine Wood.

37:39.326 --> 37:40.706
Gunter, do you copy?

37:43.019 --> 37:44.641
- Honestly Daniel, I
don't think you're gonna

37:44.641 --> 37:46.229
have any luck with
that walkie-talkie

37:46.229 --> 37:47.920
up here in the trees.

37:47.920 --> 37:51.338
Best thing is in the morning,
get up to Cold Ground,

37:51.338 --> 37:53.961
and we'll use their radio
to call down to Pine Wood.

38:13.808 --> 38:15.362
- Whatever
you say, boss.

38:23.542 --> 38:25.613
- You think the cold
did that to the cow

38:25.613 --> 38:27.581
and to the horse as well?

38:27.581 --> 38:29.962
- Well you'd have to be
totally out of your mind

38:29.962 --> 38:33.311
to do such things to
poor defenseless animals,

38:33.311 --> 38:36.314
but in most cases, the
wounds are cauterized

38:36.314 --> 38:39.040
and the mutilations
are extremely precise,

38:39.040 --> 38:41.111
so it can't be the
work of an animal.

38:41.111 --> 38:44.114
- I also heard about
these uranium mines

38:44.114 --> 38:46.324
in nuclear tests up north.

38:46.324 --> 38:47.842
- Yeah.

38:47.842 --> 38:50.051
- Do you think that could be
an explanation of all this?

38:51.329 --> 38:54.090
- With all the waste
they've been burying,

38:54.090 --> 38:57.127
I mean no wonder Mother
Nature's retaliating.

38:58.232 --> 39:00.027
Animal life's
precious, you know,

39:00.027 --> 39:02.201
and man tend to
forget about that.

39:04.859 --> 39:07.655
Shush.

39:24.085 --> 39:26.191
- Don't, don't open the tent.

39:27.606 --> 39:29.297
We don't know what that
is, and if it's an animal,

39:29.297 --> 39:31.955
it won't see us
if we stay hidden.

39:31.955 --> 39:34.372
Turn those lights off
and put the food away.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.476
Put the food away.

39:35.476 --> 39:38.583
The smell might attract them.

39:38.583 --> 39:39.411
Quickly.

41:05.808 --> 41:08.155
- If we are in danger
here, if there are bears,

41:08.155 --> 41:10.295
if there are wolves,
our lives are in danger.

41:10.295 --> 41:11.607
I say we go back in the tents.

41:11.607 --> 41:14.230
We just shut the fuck
up for the night.

41:14.230 --> 41:15.162
No one wants to get
eaten by an animal.

41:15.162 --> 41:16.197
- But it's human.

41:16.197 --> 41:18.372
- What?
- It's human remains.

41:18.372 --> 41:19.511
- You're right.

41:19.511 --> 41:20.926
What the hell
could've done that?

41:24.585 --> 41:25.793
- Oh my God!

41:26.656 --> 41:27.657
- Shit.

41:28.865 --> 41:31.109
This is now officially a
criminal investigation.

41:31.109 --> 41:33.456
- We find a torn apart
cow, and now a human's jaw.

41:33.456 --> 41:35.251
We really need to
call the police now.

41:35.251 --> 41:37.460
- Okay, first thing in
the morning when we get up

41:37.460 --> 41:39.462
to the camp, we get on the horn.

41:39.462 --> 41:42.258
We call local officials,
get a search party going.

41:42.258 --> 41:45.088
This is a lot more serious
than a mutilated calf.

41:49.437 --> 41:51.509
- You happy, you got
your sensational footage?

41:51.509 --> 41:54.995
- Daniel to Pine Wood, Daniel
to Pine Wood, do you copy?

41:54.995 --> 41:56.030
Do you copy?

42:01.311 --> 42:03.728
- Your walkie-talkie doesn't
work here in the forest.

42:03.728 --> 42:04.901
I already told you.

43:12.003 --> 43:13.245
- What's the
matter, you okay?

43:13.245 --> 43:16.076
- Yeah,
I'm okay, look.

43:17.008 --> 43:17.836
Again.

43:19.527 --> 43:21.115
Look, look at that.

43:22.876 --> 43:25.568
- No footprints,
no animal tracks.

43:25.568 --> 43:27.018
How the hell did it get here?

43:28.847 --> 43:29.814
Completely skinned.

43:32.506 --> 43:33.783
Looks pretty recent to me.

43:34.957 --> 43:35.785
- Yeah.

43:37.822 --> 43:41.135
- First the
bone, then the cow,

43:41.135 --> 43:42.136
then a human jaw.

43:42.136 --> 43:43.621
What the fuck is going on?

43:47.348 --> 43:48.936
- Come on, we're almost there.

43:48.936 --> 43:50.455
- Oh good.
- Let's go.

43:52.215 --> 43:53.769
- It's about time.

43:53.769 --> 43:54.839
I'm sick of climbing.

43:54.839 --> 43:56.772
This is exhausting.

44:04.780 --> 44:06.367
- Oh, run!

44:54.277 --> 44:55.313
- David!

45:10.638 --> 45:11.709
David, David!

45:15.022 --> 45:15.851
David!

45:18.854 --> 45:21.822
Talk to me, talk
to me, talk to me.

45:21.822 --> 45:22.961
Give me your hand.

45:24.998 --> 45:26.620
Talk to me.

45:26.620 --> 45:27.863
How do you feel?

45:27.863 --> 45:29.381
- David!

45:30.589 --> 45:31.729
- Let's get
the snow off of him.

45:38.080 --> 45:39.529
- Look at
me, look at me!

45:40.392 --> 45:42.325
Where did you last see Daniel?

45:42.325 --> 45:45.259
- He was up there,
but his leg got stuck.

45:46.398 --> 45:47.952
- I checked
that whole zone.

45:48.815 --> 45:50.402
I couldn't find him.

45:50.402 --> 45:51.610
He's under the snow.

45:51.610 --> 45:52.439
We're lucky we
saw your backpack.

45:52.439 --> 45:54.406
Are you okay?

45:54.406 --> 45:55.580
Give me your hand.

45:55.580 --> 45:56.754
We're gonna pull you up.

45:56.754 --> 45:58.272
Gotta pull you out of the snow.

45:59.377 --> 46:00.205
Ready?

46:00.205 --> 46:01.620
One, two, three!

46:02.587 --> 46:03.415
One, two, three!

46:05.970 --> 46:07.419
Does it hurt?

46:07.419 --> 46:08.248
Can you walk?

46:11.078 --> 46:12.493
- what'd he
say, what'd he say?

46:12.493 --> 46:13.425
- My ankle.

46:14.806 --> 46:16.946
- Hold me, hold me!

46:16.946 --> 46:17.775
Up.

46:19.638 --> 46:23.539
Slowly.

46:52.016 --> 46:55.916
- That was, I can't believe
you're still here filming.

46:55.916 --> 46:57.021
- I'm okay.

46:57.021 --> 46:58.505
Walking warms me up.

46:59.713 --> 47:01.197
My foot hurts, but
I should be fine.

47:03.096 --> 47:05.098
- It's amazing that
the camera survived.

47:06.099 --> 47:07.755
- Too bad Daniel
wasn't so lucky.

47:07.755 --> 47:08.998
- It's just tragic.

47:11.242 --> 47:13.796
We really need to
get to the camp.

47:13.796 --> 47:15.660
They might be able
to find him still.

47:17.006 --> 47:21.424
- Stop, people honestly
I've lost my bearings.

47:21.424 --> 47:23.219
I'm not sure where we are.

47:23.219 --> 47:25.497
The avalanche changed
the topography.

47:25.497 --> 47:27.016
I don't know this forest.

47:27.016 --> 47:28.776
But, listen it's gonna be okay.

47:29.950 --> 47:31.918
We're going to keep
heading up this way.

47:31.918 --> 47:32.850
If we don't find
the camp in an hour,

47:32.850 --> 47:34.403
we're going to set up tent.

47:34.403 --> 47:36.370
Daniel had the other tent
and the rest of the gear,

47:36.370 --> 47:38.407
but I've got enough
provisions for the night,

47:38.407 --> 47:39.649
so don't worry about it.

47:39.649 --> 47:41.065
- You're saying that
we're lost 10,000 feet

47:41.065 --> 47:42.307
up in the mountain?
- That's what I'm saying!

47:42.307 --> 47:43.481
- And you don't know
where the camp is?

47:43.481 --> 47:44.689
- That's what I'm saying
but we'll be fine.

47:44.689 --> 47:45.863
We're just gonna head
up north this way.

47:45.863 --> 47:48.072
- Wait, look
I think we found it.

47:57.529 --> 47:59.531
- So
what do we do now?

47:59.531 --> 48:02.017
- The camp is gone,
but not everything's lost.

48:02.017 --> 48:03.742
The avalanche covered
our tracks back down,

48:03.742 --> 48:05.296
but we're gonna
follow the stream.

48:05.296 --> 48:07.091
We'll get to Pine
Wood in the morning.

48:08.299 --> 48:09.576
We're gonna set up the
tent under the trees,

48:09.576 --> 48:11.543
and we'll spend the night here.

48:11.543 --> 48:13.511
David, you need to
warm up especially

48:13.511 --> 48:14.857
with your ankle injury.

48:17.895 --> 48:20.863
- There's nothing
left to eat or drink.

48:20.863 --> 48:22.796
This is a nightmare.

48:22.796 --> 48:23.624
I'm freezing.

48:24.832 --> 48:26.420
- Stop trying to fight the cold.

48:27.835 --> 48:30.804
Empty your mind of
all thoughts of cold.

48:30.804 --> 48:32.668
Concentrate on someplace warm.

48:33.911 --> 48:38.743
- Like a desert island
on a beach in a hot sun.

48:39.640 --> 48:40.848
- That's right.

48:40.848 --> 48:42.160
- I would kill to be
on the beach right now,

48:43.334 --> 48:45.060
toes in the warm sun.

48:46.751 --> 48:48.649
This bloody avalanche.

48:48.649 --> 48:49.857
- We don't even
know what happened.

48:49.857 --> 48:52.481
I mean the explosion
triggered the avalanche,

48:52.481 --> 48:54.241
but what triggered
the explosion.

48:54.241 --> 48:56.071
- And, where'd the team go?

48:56.071 --> 48:57.900
- They're probably
frozen under the ice.

49:01.386 --> 49:02.318
- What was that?

49:02.318 --> 49:03.630
Something pushed me outside.

49:04.942 --> 49:06.391
What are you doing?

49:06.391 --> 49:07.323
- I'm gonna check.

49:07.323 --> 49:08.048
- Are you crazy?

49:10.223 --> 49:11.051
No.

49:22.131 --> 49:23.477
- David!

49:24.547 --> 49:26.687
- They're crazy, they're crazy.

49:26.687 --> 49:28.310
It's okay.

49:28.310 --> 49:29.863
- They're
gonna come back, right?

49:29.863 --> 49:32.866
- Yeah, everything
is gonna be okay.

49:33.763 --> 49:35.144
We need to calm down.

49:35.144 --> 49:37.043
I don't what they're
fucking doing outside.

49:37.043 --> 49:38.561
- Okay.

49:40.598 --> 49:41.426
Okay.

49:44.464 --> 49:46.362
- What is it?

49:59.306 --> 50:00.928
- What's going on?

50:00.928 --> 50:02.309
What did he say?

50:02.309 --> 50:03.517
- I don't know, he
wanted to film something.

50:03.517 --> 50:04.449
- What?

50:04.449 --> 50:05.864
- I don't know they're crazy.

50:05.864 --> 50:07.211
Why are they doing this?

50:28.956 --> 50:30.820
- That didn't happen
during the avalanche.

50:30.820 --> 50:32.615
We're not alone,
and we're not safe.

50:35.342 --> 50:37.551
- Blake,
do you have a gun?

50:37.551 --> 50:38.863
- No.

50:38.863 --> 50:40.451
- Have
you found anything?

50:40.451 --> 50:41.762
Seen anything?

50:41.762 --> 50:43.247
- Go back,
stay in the tent.

50:43.247 --> 50:45.283
- Why, what's going on?

50:51.048 --> 50:52.049
- Sounds like a man.

50:52.049 --> 50:53.326
Someone may have survived.

50:53.326 --> 50:54.741
- Get back in the
tent, please, okay?

50:54.741 --> 50:56.432
We're gonna go check this out.

50:56.432 --> 50:58.020
You guys, just
get back in there.

50:58.020 --> 50:59.815
- No, no, no I'm
coming with you.

50:59.815 --> 51:00.885
- Yeah I'm coming too.

51:00.885 --> 51:02.093
I'm not staying here.

51:02.093 --> 51:03.336
- Then stay close
and stay quiet.

51:33.780 --> 51:34.608
Hold up.

51:36.334 --> 51:38.164
There's someone there.

51:48.035 --> 51:49.347
- Bloody hell!

51:49.347 --> 51:51.591
His face, they skinned him.

51:54.766 --> 51:56.906
- Oh Jesus Christ.

52:11.887 --> 52:13.371
- David!

52:22.622 --> 52:24.175
- Are you okay?

52:24.175 --> 52:25.521
- What was that?

52:26.729 --> 52:28.317
We have no weapons.

52:28.317 --> 52:30.664
We're gonna die here.

52:30.664 --> 52:31.907
- We gotta keep moving.

52:31.907 --> 52:33.219
I don't know what
that thing was.

52:33.219 --> 52:34.081
- But we--

52:49.752 --> 52:51.720
- David, kill the light.

53:27.445 --> 53:28.274
Over there.

53:31.208 --> 53:32.519
Our tracks from last night.

53:43.427 --> 53:44.393
I told you it was this way.

53:58.131 --> 54:03.032
We pack up, we get
out of here fast.

54:03.619 --> 54:04.482
- Lori-Ann...

54:09.556 --> 54:11.213
She's gone.

54:11.213 --> 54:13.388
- She'd want the same
thing to happen to us.

54:14.251 --> 54:15.804
Let's keep moving.

54:15.804 --> 54:17.530
Let's get outta here.

54:57.501 --> 55:01.021
- It's
that beast again.

55:03.783 --> 55:05.129
- It's a bobcat.

55:14.621 --> 55:17.003
David, use my boot
prints, take it slow.

55:18.970 --> 55:20.696
- You sure
we're going the right way?

55:20.696 --> 55:23.837
- Not 100%, but at least
we're heading down, right?

55:23.837 --> 55:25.322
- We don't even know
if we're going south.

55:25.322 --> 55:26.875
We could be going anywhere.

55:26.875 --> 55:30.499
- Daniel had the map, but
we gotta head down this way.

55:30.499 --> 55:32.087
We're getting further from
the beast's territory.

55:32.087 --> 55:33.813
That's a good thing.

55:33.813 --> 55:35.539
When we get to the
bottom, we'll take a rest.

55:44.030 --> 55:45.445
- I'm so thirsty.

55:46.722 --> 55:47.827
I'm starving.

56:05.983 --> 56:07.812
- Don't, don't.

56:09.987 --> 56:11.368
It'll speed up hypothermia.

56:12.472 --> 56:13.680
Drink out of the stream.

56:15.682 --> 56:18.236
When we get down, we're
gonna have a nice dinner,

56:18.236 --> 56:19.548
I promise.

56:19.548 --> 56:24.553
- Yeah, roast lamb with
potatoes and mushrooms,

56:26.831 --> 56:28.005
piping hot.

56:28.005 --> 56:29.903
It'll be so hot we'll
burn our mouths.

56:29.903 --> 56:31.629
- Yeah, I'm
gonna hold you to that.

56:31.629 --> 56:32.458
- Yeah.

56:38.256 --> 56:41.156
- What do you think
it was last night, Blake?

56:41.156 --> 56:42.571
- What do I think?

56:42.571 --> 56:43.641
I don't know.

56:47.611 --> 56:50.407
At high altitude, there are
a lot of strange creatures.

56:50.407 --> 56:51.718
It's so isolated here.

56:53.202 --> 56:55.342
Is this Switzerland or
France do you think?

56:55.342 --> 56:56.413
- I don't know.

56:57.621 --> 56:58.656
- Maybe it's Bigfoot.

56:59.623 --> 57:00.624
- What's Bigfoot?

57:02.073 --> 57:04.835
- It's a creature living in
the forests of North America.

57:08.217 --> 57:10.944
Something like the abominable
snowman or the yeti.

57:10.944 --> 57:13.775
Some people say it's real,
some people say it's a legend.

57:15.501 --> 57:18.365
- Well what we saw
yesterday was real,

57:18.365 --> 57:19.470
and it was a carnivore.

57:21.403 --> 57:25.683
- Yeah, a lot of freaky
creatures living up here.

57:32.552 --> 57:34.071
- Will it be back?

57:36.004 --> 57:37.488
- I don't think so.

57:37.488 --> 57:39.317
I think we walked long enough,
we're out of its territory.

57:40.595 --> 57:42.942
It's a nocturnal
creature that's for sure.

57:42.942 --> 57:44.909
That's why no one's
seen if before.

57:44.909 --> 57:45.738
- A werewolf.

57:48.050 --> 57:51.709
- No, I don't believe
in fairy tales.

57:53.608 --> 57:56.438
- Do you think that beast
provoked the avalanche,

57:56.438 --> 57:57.715
and that explosion before?

58:02.237 --> 58:03.859
- Frankly, it
doesn't matter now.

58:03.859 --> 58:06.172
All that matters is
getting you two back safe.

58:07.553 --> 58:09.796
The sooner we get walking,
the sooner we get down there.

58:12.419 --> 58:14.007
And, you're gonna owe
me some roast lamb

58:14.007 --> 58:14.974
whatever the dish.

58:17.045 --> 58:22.050
- Yeah, with some hot
cocoa with warm croissant.

58:25.502 --> 58:28.263
- I'm gonna hold you to it.

58:28.263 --> 58:29.195
You okay?

58:29.195 --> 58:30.679
- Yeah, I'm all right.

58:33.199 --> 58:34.027
Thanks.

58:45.245 --> 58:46.074
- Okay.

59:08.027 --> 59:08.924
- Today's Sunday.

59:10.616 --> 59:11.651
We left on Wednesday.

59:16.863 --> 59:19.038
Back home, my kids are
probably skipping out

59:19.038 --> 59:20.764
on church services right now.

59:23.801 --> 59:28.806
Okay, concentrate
on someplace warm.

59:32.707 --> 59:36.400
We're sitting in front
of the fireplace tomorrow

59:36.400 --> 59:37.781
when we get back down.

59:41.578 --> 59:42.406
- I wish.

59:45.374 --> 59:46.583
I hope his leg will be okay.

59:46.583 --> 59:47.791
It'll be fine.

59:53.935 --> 59:56.696
- I've gotta go outside and
get some wood to make a fire.

59:57.939 --> 59:59.388
Fuck, I don't have a lighter.

01:00:00.907 --> 01:00:02.737
- Do you know how to
make sparks with stones?

01:00:02.737 --> 01:00:05.015
- Yeah, it's gonna be
tough, but I can do it.

01:00:07.949 --> 01:00:11.228
- Okay, I'll come with you.

01:00:11.228 --> 01:00:12.712
- We only have one flashlight.

01:01:04.281 --> 01:01:05.109
- I got some wood over here.

01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:07.008
You go find some stones.

01:01:07.008 --> 01:01:08.526
I'm gonna grab these branches.

01:01:42.388 --> 01:01:44.597
- Blake?

01:01:44.597 --> 01:01:45.391
Blake!

01:01:48.981 --> 01:01:50.016
Blake!

01:01:50.016 --> 01:01:50.914
- What?

01:01:50.914 --> 01:01:52.363
Melissa!

01:02:07.447 --> 01:02:09.449
We gotta get outta here!

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:12.798
To the right!

01:02:20.495 --> 01:02:23.084
Melissa, Melissa, stop!

Calm down!

01:02:32.507 --> 01:02:34.302
Calm down, you're
gonna get us lost!

01:02:35.234 --> 01:02:36.614
Take the camera.

01:02:36.614 --> 01:02:38.478
Take the camera, I've
got the flashlight.

01:02:39.583 --> 01:02:40.826
Tent's back there.

01:02:40.826 --> 01:02:41.688

01:05:21.814 --> 01:05:22.642
Blake.

01:05:29.822 --> 01:05:31.341
Come on, get up.

01:05:31.341 --> 01:05:32.480
