From the high desert

01:26.753 --> 01:29.214
and the great
American Southwest,

01:29.298 --> 01:32.384
this is Midnight in the Desert.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.761
Welcome, good morning,
good afternoon,

01:34.845 --> 01:36.722
good evening,
wherever you are

01:36.805 --> 01:38.891
and welcome to yet
another edition

01:38.974 --> 01:42.311
of the very best in live
overnight talk radio.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.521
Good evening, everyone.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.523
Welcome to Shadow House.

01:46.940 --> 01:50.068
I'm your host, your MC,
your congenial guide

01:50.152 --> 01:52.696
into the dark corners
of human existence.

01:53.322 --> 01:56.783
Ridley Kay broadcasting
from a secret location

01:56.867 --> 01:59.620
in the desolate hills
of North Texas.

02:00.412 --> 02:02.956
This show
is for fellow travelers,

02:03.040 --> 02:06.335
mind-expanders,
truth seekers,

02:06.418 --> 02:08.211
and the morbidly curious.

02:09.128 --> 02:10.672
We got a great show for you.

02:10.756 --> 02:15.219
Tonight, we talk
about ancient aliens!

02:18.805 --> 02:22.476
Yes, tonight over the phone
is a tried and true UFO geek.

02:22.559 --> 02:23.560
Welcome!

02:23.936 --> 02:27.397
It's great to be back
after a short absence.

02:28.732 --> 02:30.567
One in 50 children

02:30.651 --> 02:33.195
will experience
a paranormal encounter.

02:33.278 --> 02:36.281
Many of them will suffer
continued encounters

02:36.365 --> 02:37.866
for the rest of their lives.

02:39.535 --> 02:42.162
The UFO phenom
and alien abductions

02:42.246 --> 02:46.625
have been with us continuously
since the dawn of mankind.

02:50.838 --> 02:54.508
...gray aliens everywhere
in Samarian civilization.

02:54.591 --> 02:59.012
Strang skulls, dark skin,
large eyes.

03:00.472 --> 03:01.723
Creepy.

03:03.308 --> 03:04.935
People, before we start,

03:05.060 --> 03:07.896
I want to get Arnold's take
on all the current madness

03:08.021 --> 03:09.439
unfolding in real time.

03:09.940 --> 03:14.319
Its insane meltdown
in the Middle East,

03:14.403 --> 03:18.699
the still missing
Malaysia Airlines flight NH37.

03:19.074 --> 03:21.660
Ukraine and Russia,
and the tragic downing

03:21.702 --> 03:23.871
of Malaysia 17.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.665
You'd think variably of course.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.500
That's easier said than done.

03:28.584 --> 03:31.128
I mean, there are
so many variables

03:31.211 --> 03:34.256
that we should consider such as
secret US air bases

03:34.381 --> 03:35.799
at Diego Garcia.

03:35.966 --> 03:40.304
...interests.
Putin and Russia standing firm.

03:40.804 --> 03:43.891
...a lot of strange things
surrounding Flight 17.

03:44.057 --> 03:47.311
I'd say Russia
might be set up

03:47.394 --> 03:50.647
by the Western press
which have been ramping up

03:50.731 --> 03:52.649
in secret bias reporting.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.985
- Divide and conquer, right?
- Absolutely.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.946
The real masters are moving
to push us aside

03:58.030 --> 04:02.201
to take over while most people
become more and more dumb down

04:02.284 --> 04:04.912
by corporate-controlled news
and entertainment

04:04.995 --> 04:06.580
if you could call it that.

04:06.663 --> 04:09.208
Circus
like the Roman emperors did.

04:09.291 --> 04:13.045
Right. This is an age
old conflict between the elite

04:13.128 --> 04:14.463
and the masses.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.757
Is the East and West
being manipulated

04:16.839 --> 04:19.760
into an unavoidable
World War III scenario?

04:19.843 --> 04:22.095
They sure
are moving fast

04:22.179 --> 04:24.264
and coming to a head.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.851
Let's get onto
the bigger picture here.

04:27.935 --> 04:31.230
"Shee-ple--"
I mean, people.

04:31.313 --> 04:34.149
I've loved the paranormal
since I was a little boy.

04:36.735 --> 04:40.322
If you're religiously challenged
and or intellectually retarded,

04:40.405 --> 04:42.658
turn your radio dials now.

04:42.699 --> 04:46.245
Click your web browsers over
to some cute puppies

04:46.328 --> 04:47.871
before we melt your brain,

04:47.955 --> 04:50.832
shatter your pre-conceived ideas
about the universe

04:50.916 --> 04:52.584
and leave you crying
in the corner

04:52.668 --> 04:54.127
like a little bitch.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.438
What if I have nightmares again?

05:17.442 --> 05:19.653
Good girls don't have
nightmares, honey.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.199
So be a good girl.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.125
Crystal.

05:49.474 --> 05:50.684
You're awake.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.700
Every man fantasizes about
picking up a beautiful girl

06:06.783 --> 06:08.076
off the road
and giving her a ride.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.786
You don’t want this fantasy.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.080
Why?

06:12.998 --> 06:14.499
You a serial killer?

06:17.753 --> 06:19.338
Let me out.

06:20.422 --> 06:21.965
Can I drop you somewhere?

06:22.049 --> 06:23.383
Just stop the car!

06:23.467 --> 06:26.428
Miss, I found you passed out
from heat exhaustion.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.432
...took the UFO
phenomenon seriously--

06:32.059 --> 06:33.185
Name's Mal.

06:34.686 --> 06:35.938
Short for Malcom?

06:37.689 --> 06:38.690
Malvin.

06:39.942 --> 06:41.443
Bad-ass, huh?

06:43.153 --> 06:44.947
Check out the smile on that one!

06:50.953 --> 06:52.496
My name's Crystal.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.122
Feel's good, doesn't it?

06:54.790 --> 06:55.791
What?

06:57.501 --> 06:58.710
Moving on.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.298
I grew up an army brat.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.133
I traveled the world
with my pa.

07:05.968 --> 07:09.054
He was based in Germany,
Saudi Arabia,

07:09.137 --> 07:10.430
Philippines, you name it.

07:10.889 --> 07:12.349
Want to be a soldier, too?

07:13.600 --> 07:16.019
World helped me
appreciate my beliefs.

07:16.061 --> 07:19.523
I believe if there was less
ignorance in the world,

07:19.606 --> 07:22.651
people would just come together,
set aside all the differences.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.612
I think it's all pieces
of a giant jigsaw puzzle.

07:25.904 --> 07:28.282
And our government still
wants us to figure it out.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.158
I don't know
anything about religion.

07:30.826 --> 07:33.078
My parents were something else.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.039
Yeah, well, far more things

07:36.123 --> 07:38.333
in this world that unite us
than divide us.

07:48.802 --> 07:49.970
Why not?

08:03.525 --> 08:05.652
Welcome to my humble abode.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.946
I'm Ryan,
how can I help ya'll?

08:08.530 --> 08:11.325
Uh, we'd like a couple
of cheeseburgers

08:11.408 --> 08:12.993
and two rooms for the night.

08:14.620 --> 08:17.664
Ah, well, since you two
look like lost lovers,

08:18.415 --> 08:20.000
I'll give you the special suite

08:20.626 --> 08:22.461
I only give to honeymooners!

08:22.878 --> 08:24.838
Sounds great.
That'll have to do.

08:51.949 --> 08:52.950
Gentlemen.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.135
- Three.
- Three.

09:18.559 --> 09:19.685
I'm out.

09:20.269 --> 09:21.270
Okay.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.482
Three knights.

09:25.983 --> 09:26.984
Shoot!

09:46.628 --> 09:49.214
This here is some both queens.
Bet everything.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.885
Those are my three best cards.

09:57.306 --> 09:58.307
Three.

10:00.601 --> 10:01.602
Two.

10:06.315 --> 10:07.774
I'll take two.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.531
Hell, I'm all in.

10:23.498 --> 10:24.499
Yee-haw!

10:25.083 --> 10:27.336
Every dog has its day, ladies!

10:27.461 --> 10:29.004
Thank you. Thank you, gentlemen.

10:33.926 --> 10:35.177
How did you do that?

10:49.233 --> 10:52.569
Nine of spades.
Ace of hearts

10:52.736 --> 10:54.780
Six of spades.
Six of hearts.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.157
Six of diamonds.
King of clubs.

10:57.241 --> 10:59.368
Jack of diamonds.
Ten of spades.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.286
Queen of clubs.
Seven of clubs.

11:01.578 --> 11:03.455
Nine of clubs,
Four of spades.

11:17.970 --> 11:18.971
Crystal!

11:23.767 --> 11:25.352
You and your
scrawny-ass girlfriend

11:25.435 --> 11:27.062
better get the hell out of here!

11:44.454 --> 11:45.914
Sit down. Rest.

11:53.714 --> 11:54.715
Crystal!

11:56.675 --> 11:58.177
Where's that sound coming from?

12:01.972 --> 12:03.432
Crystal, what's going on?

12:07.519 --> 12:08.729
Tell me so I can help.

12:10.272 --> 12:12.441
- Please, tell me--
- Get away from me!

12:12.900 --> 12:14.985
- I'm not being the bad guy!
- Get away from me!

13:10.290 --> 13:11.667
Nice caravan.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.045
Don't get excited.
It ain't mine.

13:15.420 --> 13:18.757
Boy, I hope you're not using
my property for your hook ups.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.677
- Hey.
- Hello.

13:25.222 --> 13:26.223
Hm.

13:27.266 --> 13:30.060
I'm Lyra Coslov.
I'm a UFO researcher.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.603
I'm helping Ridley
with his radio show.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.732
- Zane McAllister.
- You old smoothy.

13:38.110 --> 13:39.820
- Good night.
- Good night.

13:47.244 --> 13:49.037
- Rent.
- Oh.

14:01.091 --> 14:02.217
Where's the rest?

14:02.301 --> 14:04.178
Business is shit
in this economy.

14:07.181 --> 14:09.725
I got hustled by this
young couple at the diner.

14:10.184 --> 14:14.062
I swear, this chick could read
my cards before I dealt them.

14:14.146 --> 14:17.900
And then she pretended
to be sick

14:17.983 --> 14:19.735
and they both took off
with my money.

14:25.324 --> 14:28.035
That's the lamest excuse
you've ever come up with.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.120
When are you going
to get a move on?

14:31.330 --> 14:34.041
Get your sorry-ass RV
off my property?

14:34.958 --> 14:37.211
Stop leeching my water
and my power.

14:37.669 --> 14:39.838
Getting tired of taking
my dead presidents

14:39.922 --> 14:40.923
every month, Zane?

14:41.006 --> 14:42.883
Yeah, well, it would be nice
if I got all of them.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.887
Plus, when I agreed to rent
to your dumb ass,

14:46.970 --> 14:48.514
I didn't know that you were
the ring leader

14:48.597 --> 14:50.140
of "Blasphemy Radio".

14:50.307 --> 14:52.142
Live free or die, right?

14:53.810 --> 14:56.271
I don't like being
on the government's radar.

14:58.440 --> 14:59.566
I'll leave soon enough.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.110
Well, you're on my radar
and it sucks.

15:03.612 --> 15:05.113
If you don't pay
all of your rent,

15:06.031 --> 15:08.283
from now on, it's going
to take 600 a month

15:08.367 --> 15:10.702
after this
so that it doesn't suck.

15:10.869 --> 15:11.870
Hypocrite.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.333
I thought you devout Christians
hated money.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.751
Root of all evil and shit.

15:17.835 --> 15:20.128
Well, better Christian
than your cockamamie mixture

15:20.212 --> 15:24.258
of, uh, conspiracy theory
and new age crap.

15:24.299 --> 15:27.261
They'd ought to invent of word
of what you believe in.

15:27.344 --> 15:30.472
Uh, "con-spiritualism"
or something.

15:30.848 --> 15:32.182
Six hundred.

15:34.810 --> 15:39.314
That, uh, pretty foreign girl,
is she another nut job like you?

15:39.481 --> 15:41.900
I know! She's perfect!

15:45.112 --> 15:47.948
Say hello, to, uh,
master lucifer for me.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.575
No prob.

15:49.658 --> 15:51.827
Enjoy the brutal beat down
you get from Saint Peter

15:51.910 --> 15:53.829
when you try to cross
the pearly gates.

16:57.809 --> 17:00.479
So another episode
of Shadow House.

17:00.646 --> 17:02.981
As you can see,
I have a co-host now.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.317
Oh, fancy.

17:07.778 --> 17:09.238
Check out the looker
on your left.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.823
Right, your right.

17:13.867 --> 17:16.203
After months of you guys
pathetically begging,

17:16.286 --> 17:18.539
I invited best-selling
UFO author

17:18.579 --> 17:20.790
and paranormal researcher
Lyra Coslov

17:20.958 --> 17:22.209
to co-host the show
for a week.

17:22.626 --> 17:24.670
She accepted my invitation.
Go figure.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.214
Welcome to the show, Lyra.

17:27.381 --> 17:28.924
It shouldn't be too surprising.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.384
- You have a latch for knowing--
- Hold a sec.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.678
You're not accustomed
to talking on the radio.

17:32.845 --> 17:35.264
I'm going to give you
a sexy voice.

17:35.347 --> 17:39.184
A sexy voice? Wow!

17:39.643 --> 17:42.604
I've you under
a version of photoshop, baby.

17:45.482 --> 17:47.109
I'm Ridley Kay.

17:47.192 --> 17:49.528
And I'm your father's brother's
nephew's cousin's

17:49.611 --> 17:50.737
former roommate.

17:50.821 --> 17:51.864
What does that make us?

17:51.947 --> 17:52.990
Absolutely nothing.

17:53.532 --> 17:55.576
Dude, don't steal my thunder

17:55.659 --> 17:57.119
by talking
before your introduction.

17:57.286 --> 17:59.621
- Sorry, Rid.
- Long-time listeners

17:59.705 --> 18:01.582
will recognize the voice
of our next guest.

18:02.291 --> 18:05.252
He holds two PhDs
in electrical engineering

18:05.335 --> 18:06.670
in astro-physics.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.798
Plus, he's winner of the
prestigious Ridley Kay

18:09.882 --> 18:11.758
Overall Cool Guy aware.

18:11.925 --> 18:15.179
An oldie, but a goodie.
Please welcome White Path.

18:15.304 --> 18:18.682
Chief technology advisor
but not a chief, huh?

18:18.849 --> 18:20.976
Always the bridesmaid
but never the bride.

18:21.059 --> 18:22.477
You wanted to give us an update

18:22.561 --> 18:24.438
on our old friend HAARP
in Alaska.

18:24.521 --> 18:27.566
What's going on exactly
in the Arctic Circle?

18:27.733 --> 18:29.902
There's a secret arms race
going on, folks,

18:29.985 --> 18:31.737
to control the atmosphere
of the earth.

18:31.862 --> 18:34.448
In fact, if listeners
click onto my website:

18:34.531 --> 18:35.824
whitepath.org,

18:37.201 --> 18:39.661
they can observe HAARP
activities in real time

18:39.828 --> 18:41.163
as we speak.

18:41.246 --> 18:45.584
Explain exactly what HAARP is
in terms that a drunken teenager

18:45.667 --> 18:49.129
listening to us on Friday night
at three a.m. can understand.

18:49.296 --> 18:53.300
Right. Well, HAARP,
spelled H-A-A-R-P

18:53.467 --> 18:55.052
is not
a musical instrument, kids.

18:55.219 --> 18:58.597
It's an acronym referring
to a secret government facility

18:58.680 --> 19:02.726
in Alaska known as the
high-frequency active auroral--

19:02.809 --> 19:05.687
- Layman's terms, brother.
- Okay, morons.

19:05.771 --> 19:08.565
Think of it as a one billion
volt microwave oven

19:08.649 --> 19:09.650
aimed at the sky.

19:09.733 --> 19:10.734
That would make
a lot of popcorn.

19:10.859 --> 19:13.028
...generates low-frequency
radio waves

19:13.111 --> 19:15.364
in the atmosphere that ripple
all across the world.

19:15.531 --> 19:17.574
See, the US government
uses this program

19:17.658 --> 19:19.660
to study the ionosphere
of planet earth.

19:19.743 --> 19:22.538
However, it does have
many troubling applications.

19:22.663 --> 19:24.456
In fact, HAARP is peaking
right now.

19:25.123 --> 19:26.458
Many conspiracy theorists

19:26.583 --> 19:28.335
believe HAARP
control the weather.

19:28.418 --> 19:30.504
And even punch holes
into alternate dimension.

19:31.046 --> 19:33.006
HAARP will eventually
play a part

19:33.090 --> 19:36.093
in clandestine mind control
of large populations.

19:36.552 --> 19:38.804
In combination with
chemtrail technology

19:38.887 --> 19:41.682
and particularly,
if they manage to implant

19:41.765 --> 19:43.725
- RFID microchips.
- And what do you believe?

19:43.892 --> 19:45.435
I mean, for what purpose?

19:45.602 --> 19:47.145
See, whenever HAARP activates,

19:47.312 --> 19:50.732
people around the world
complain about strange events.

19:50.816 --> 19:52.651
Lights, altered mental states,

19:52.860 --> 19:55.737
sounds, voices, UFOs.

19:55.821 --> 19:57.531
Hell, someone out there
might be having

19:57.614 --> 19:59.658
a real interesting night
right now.

20:00.450 --> 20:01.660
We have a caller.

20:01.702 --> 20:03.620
That's my private line.
I never give that number out.

20:06.164 --> 20:08.959
Alright, enough of your
Native American Jedi

20:09.042 --> 20:10.169
mumbo jumbo.

20:11.003 --> 20:12.963
East to the Rockies,
you're on the air.

20:13.839 --> 20:15.174
Please, I need your help!

20:15.257 --> 20:17.593
Sounds like we have ourselves
a prankster.

20:17.676 --> 20:19.219
- Sayonara, lady.
- Wait!

20:20.345 --> 20:21.722
Someone's following me!

20:21.805 --> 20:25.350
Oh, let me guess,
you used a Ouija board once

20:25.475 --> 20:27.227
and now Satan
lives in your closet.

20:27.311 --> 20:29.771
- Kid, I've heard it all.
- Listen!

20:34.902 --> 20:37.112
You know, Rid?
Those could be HAARP sounds.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.448
♪ The monarch flies
Across the sky ♪

20:40.324 --> 20:42.034
Where did you hear that?

20:45.954 --> 20:48.373
And I'm going to bring it
to you the truth!

20:48.540 --> 20:50.501
- Brought to your front door!
- Alright, cupcake.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.336
It's way past your bed time.

21:08.060 --> 21:11.021
I got a bad feeling about this.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.611
Here's to another year
of truth seeking.

21:28.747 --> 21:30.332
Oh!

21:51.478 --> 21:53.146
Not another step, young lady!

21:54.022 --> 21:55.649
You're trespassing
on my property!

21:56.149 --> 21:58.151
That's the girl
who stole my money!

22:01.321 --> 22:03.323
- Someone's following me.
- Yeah, probably the sheriff!

22:03.407 --> 22:04.908
Yeah, he's looking for her
and that kid!

22:05.367 --> 22:07.870
How are you going to pay
for that there gate, young lady?

22:08.745 --> 22:10.706
Where's that stupid kid
with my money?

22:12.332 --> 22:13.417
No way.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.252
Doesn't look like any kid
I ever saw.

22:24.887 --> 22:26.722
Please help me.

22:27.598 --> 22:29.391
You want help?
Go to the sheriff.

22:29.474 --> 22:31.810
Zane McAllister,
put your dick away.

22:33.061 --> 22:34.771
What the hell is all this fuss?

22:35.856 --> 22:37.357
A woman can't sleep.

22:39.902 --> 22:42.779
Zane, can't you tell
this poor girl's in trouble?

22:45.282 --> 22:46.283
Here.

22:57.252 --> 22:58.378
I'm Caroline.

22:59.296 --> 23:02.174
And "Mr. Trigger Happy"
is Zane, my husband.

23:03.467 --> 23:04.718
You hungry?

23:05.385 --> 23:08.180
How's about I fix you
a sandwich? Okay?

23:09.306 --> 23:10.766
My name's Crystal.

23:11.725 --> 23:15.145
Dipshit over there
is the infamous Ridley Kay

23:15.229 --> 23:18.273
and his girlfriend Laura,
or whatever.

23:20.859 --> 23:22.277
Pick up. Pick up!

23:23.237 --> 23:24.947
Yo, White Path. Come over here.

23:26.156 --> 23:28.325
Remember that crazy chick
from the show?

23:28.408 --> 23:29.868
She's here at Zane's place.

23:30.744 --> 23:33.080
No, shit.
I have no idea how she found me.

23:33.163 --> 23:34.456
And she wasn't kidding!

23:34.581 --> 23:35.749
Why'd you come here?

23:36.875 --> 23:39.628
She had a man in black
trailing her.

23:40.379 --> 23:42.381
You know, those guys
from the government

23:42.422 --> 23:44.967
who show up after UFO sightings
and threaten everyone

23:45.050 --> 23:46.093
to shut up!

23:47.094 --> 23:48.846
Just get your ass over here!

23:49.012 --> 23:50.138
Turn it on?

23:51.890 --> 23:53.141
I'm listening to a show.

23:55.727 --> 23:57.145
No wonder you need help.

24:07.447 --> 24:08.448
Crystal.

24:09.199 --> 24:11.869
Meet White Path.
White Path, Crystal.

24:12.786 --> 24:13.787
Look.

24:14.788 --> 24:17.374
If there really are forces
following this girl,

24:18.792 --> 24:21.420
We should cover the considered
things before getting involved.

24:24.006 --> 24:25.924
Life isn't a haunted house,
Ridley.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.010
These scares aren't fake.

24:28.093 --> 24:30.095
And they don't stop just
because we want them to.

24:37.060 --> 24:38.061
Okay.

24:57.831 --> 24:59.499
Her energy is dark, brother.

25:01.293 --> 25:02.336
I mean real dark!

25:02.419 --> 25:04.546
Don't you see this is
our opportunity to prove--

25:04.630 --> 25:06.381
Prove what?

25:06.465 --> 25:07.466
Everything!

25:07.549 --> 25:10.302
My grandfather says you only
fight demons

25:10.385 --> 25:12.054
if you're an angel.

25:12.221 --> 25:13.514
...more than once.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.975
Tornadoes. We call them
tornadoes in American.

25:18.352 --> 25:20.479
If the tornado wants her,

25:20.562 --> 25:22.064
you and the holy roller
over there going to stand

25:22.147 --> 25:23.524
in its way, gringo?

25:23.607 --> 25:24.608
Absolutely.

25:30.531 --> 25:31.532
I'll come by tomorrow.

25:32.533 --> 25:33.534
Lyra.

25:38.038 --> 25:39.373
I had a clear shot.

25:45.462 --> 25:47.464
Back to the Morning Star Hotel.

25:47.965 --> 25:50.300
It's very late. You could--

25:50.384 --> 25:51.885
Sleep in your crappy
rental home?

25:52.928 --> 25:54.930
Yeah, it doesn't sound so great

25:55.013 --> 25:57.057
when you speak
the idea out loud.

26:00.644 --> 26:03.146
Well, I'll, uh,
come back tomorrow.

26:08.277 --> 26:09.736
To check on Crystal.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.379
It's, um, it's nice having
a young lady in the house again.

27:10.255 --> 27:12.132
Caroline, we're not going
down that road.

27:12.966 --> 27:14.259
Not with that girl.

27:16.303 --> 27:17.513
Is she not coming out?

27:39.493 --> 27:40.911
Did you sleep at all?

27:44.122 --> 27:45.374
I don't belong here.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.210
I should leave.

27:53.757 --> 27:55.133
Enough moping around.

27:56.468 --> 27:57.469
Kid.

27:58.262 --> 27:59.847
You want to belong?
Earn your keep.

28:01.473 --> 28:03.809
There's lots to do at the barn.
Come on.

28:45.642 --> 28:48.812
Holy shit. This is what
you guys saw last night.

29:07.539 --> 29:08.916
I'll see you guys later.

29:35.651 --> 29:38.278
Okay, here we go!

29:41.532 --> 29:43.575
Zane, would you care
to say grace, please?

29:46.662 --> 29:48.372
Bless us our lord
and these fine gifts

29:48.455 --> 29:50.999
we're going to receive
to Jesus Christ our lord.

29:51.083 --> 29:55.420
And please damn Ridley to hell
for eternity. Amen.

29:58.674 --> 30:00.259
Did I miss something?

30:04.763 --> 30:07.057
Okay, okay.
So let me get this straight.

30:07.474 --> 30:09.560
- You're an atheist.
- That's right.

30:10.060 --> 30:11.979
And you believe
in the great spirit?

30:12.020 --> 30:13.021
Absolutely.

30:13.814 --> 30:14.982
We're Christians.

30:16.525 --> 30:17.818
And you?

30:17.860 --> 30:21.238
I believe in everything
except creation.

30:21.321 --> 30:24.157
Aliens created us as some kind
of an experiment.

30:26.118 --> 30:27.202
And you, Crystal?

30:28.912 --> 30:29.955
I don't know what I believe.

30:32.082 --> 30:34.042
So if aliens created us,

30:34.793 --> 30:36.128
who created them?

30:40.382 --> 30:42.092
We shouldn't be at
each other's throats.

30:42.259 --> 30:44.344
No, I disagree.
This is exactly what people

30:44.428 --> 30:45.762
with different beliefs
should be doing.

30:45.846 --> 30:47.014
Having a nice dinner.

30:47.472 --> 30:49.766
- And great food helps.
- Very true.

30:49.850 --> 30:51.101
- Yeah!
- Thank you.

30:51.185 --> 30:53.353
Well done, Caroline.

30:56.607 --> 30:58.525
For once not for you.

30:58.734 --> 30:59.943
Thank you. Thanks.

31:08.911 --> 31:09.912
Crystal.

31:11.371 --> 31:12.873
Complete your task first.

31:15.334 --> 31:16.543
If you finish dinner
early enough,

31:16.627 --> 31:18.504
Mom's going to read you
Alice in Wonderland

31:18.587 --> 31:19.880
before bedtime.

31:22.007 --> 31:23.759
I'm tired of that story, Mommy.

31:23.842 --> 31:25.302
Can we read something else?

31:33.268 --> 31:36.396
You love Alice in Wonderland.

31:37.648 --> 31:39.900
My momma use to read that to me
all the time.

32:03.632 --> 32:05.217
Bullshit, Ridley.

32:05.342 --> 32:08.303
President Clinton couldn't keep
eleven private meetings

32:08.387 --> 32:09.763
with the interns.

32:11.640 --> 32:14.101
Do you know how many people
would have to be involved

32:14.142 --> 32:15.310
in all those conspiracies?

32:15.727 --> 32:16.937
It's crazy!

32:17.145 --> 32:18.272
Ridley's right.

32:18.981 --> 32:20.190
It happens.

32:20.899 --> 32:24.027
Look at this.
LA Times 1995.

32:24.903 --> 32:28.031
"President Clinton apologizes
to the survivors and families"

32:28.115 --> 32:30.742
of those
who were unknowing subjects

32:30.826 --> 32:33.203
of government-sponsored
radiation experiments."

32:34.288 --> 32:35.664
How's that?

32:36.540 --> 32:38.250
I hate smartphone pads.

32:38.792 --> 32:41.128
And this one MKUltra.

32:41.879 --> 32:44.006
" The New York Times in 1974

32:44.089 --> 32:46.758
exposes a secret
US government program

32:46.842 --> 32:49.219
that ran through the 50s and 60s

32:49.303 --> 32:52.848
involving unknown US citizens
in an attempt to create

32:52.931 --> 32:56.727
mind-controlled slaves
using psychiatric drugs,

32:56.810 --> 32:58.896
sexual abuse and torture.

32:59.479 --> 33:02.941
The CIA ordered
all project files destroyed

33:03.108 --> 33:07.321
but 20,000 documents survived
when they were accidently stored

33:07.404 --> 33:09.865
among financial records
that were recovered

33:09.948 --> 33:11.366
through the
Freedom of Information Act."

33:11.450 --> 33:12.993
But why?

33:13.076 --> 33:15.913
Isn't the government made up
of normal human beings?

33:17.164 --> 33:20.167
Why on earth would anyone
want to do such horrible things

33:20.250 --> 33:22.044
to good, everyday people?

33:23.337 --> 33:25.797
Miss McAllister, that's where
Ridley's show comes in.

33:27.174 --> 33:29.593
We believe some other force
is at work.

33:29.676 --> 33:31.220
American ideas
aren't the problem.

33:31.595 --> 33:33.096
Something seems
to be interfering

33:33.180 --> 33:34.348
with American reality.

33:35.599 --> 33:37.601
Some outer force? Please.

33:38.060 --> 33:40.312
I'm sorry,
and you know the truth?

33:40.479 --> 33:43.941
Know I don't, but in a world
where extraterrestrials exist,

33:44.107 --> 33:45.651
- I--
- Are you sure about that?

33:45.817 --> 33:49.446
Yes. I was abducted
when I was nine.

33:49.613 --> 33:52.908
Were you abducted?
I didn't think so.

33:53.909 --> 33:56.328
Look, I researched the subject
for over 15 years.

33:56.411 --> 33:57.955
Very impressive.

33:58.038 --> 34:00.290
Well, I've studied science
for 17 years.

34:01.083 --> 34:02.584
And I hold two PhDs.

34:03.252 --> 34:04.837
I've had a book published.

34:06.296 --> 34:07.297
Bravo.

34:08.799 --> 34:10.801
Look, all I'm saying is,

34:10.884 --> 34:13.136
that in a world
where UFOs are real,

34:13.679 --> 34:16.681
none of your creation stories
make any sense whatsoever.

34:16.764 --> 34:19.268
We're not debating
religion again.

34:19.351 --> 34:20.686
Thank you.

34:22.396 --> 34:24.731
That is just
to keep you company, sweetie.

34:32.155 --> 34:34.199
We're not debating religion!

34:48.589 --> 34:49.590
Zane?

34:56.471 --> 34:57.472
Record that.

34:57.556 --> 34:58.807
It's just static.

34:58.891 --> 35:00.142
Just do it.

35:08.901 --> 35:09.860
You've reached the home

35:09.943 --> 35:11.945
of Caroline and Zane McAllister.

35:12.029 --> 35:13.363
Speak your piece.

35:14.072 --> 35:15.824
Have a blessed day.

35:17.868 --> 35:19.244
Crystal...

35:30.923 --> 35:32.174
Who is this?

35:36.470 --> 35:38.514
What do you want?
Are you the man in black?

35:42.518 --> 35:43.519
Crystal...

35:45.854 --> 35:47.731
Stop following me!

35:51.652 --> 35:52.653
Crystal!

35:53.987 --> 35:54.988
Crystal!

35:56.406 --> 35:57.574
Crystal, stop!

36:01.578 --> 36:02.871
You'll be safer with us.

36:03.872 --> 36:05.791
If I stay, all of you will die!

36:06.124 --> 36:07.459
Not if we work together.

36:07.835 --> 36:09.795
You can't outrun the government.

36:09.878 --> 36:12.548
This thing will catch up
with you one way or another.

36:13.090 --> 36:15.342
You really want to be alone
when that happens?

36:40.242 --> 36:43.161
My entire life's a sequence
of strange events.

36:44.288 --> 36:47.457
I never knew exactly how strange
until my parents were murdered

36:47.583 --> 36:49.168
when I was nine years old.

36:53.005 --> 36:56.008
Living in an orphanage
was more normal,

36:56.091 --> 36:59.678
My eyes were finally open
that I was special.

37:00.470 --> 37:02.055
And not in a good way.

37:02.139 --> 37:03.265
Who killed them?

37:05.350 --> 37:06.351
Me?

37:07.269 --> 37:08.270
Possibly.

37:09.730 --> 37:11.607
The police never found
the killer.

37:13.692 --> 37:16.528
Ridiculous!
I mean, you were a child.

37:17.988 --> 37:19.573
That's what everyone
keeps saying.

37:20.490 --> 37:22.743
You don't remember
if you killed your parents?

37:23.452 --> 37:26.205
I'm afraid now and then
I lose these blocks of time.

37:29.499 --> 37:31.251
It happened that night.

37:36.715 --> 37:37.716
Crystal.

37:53.190 --> 37:55.817
The only thing
I remember from my childhood

37:55.859 --> 37:58.695
is seeing that man
staring at me.

38:01.114 --> 38:03.992
Same thing happened
yesterday also.

38:06.578 --> 38:08.288
And now, he's coming for me.

38:09.373 --> 38:10.374
Who?

38:11.208 --> 38:12.334
The man in black?

38:14.628 --> 38:16.171
Can you tell us
who Malvin is?

38:18.423 --> 38:20.342
I left the orphanage
and I caught a ride

38:20.425 --> 38:21.760
with a man named Malvin.

38:27.140 --> 38:30.602
And the lights followed me
in the sky like they often do.

38:32.479 --> 38:34.481
And now, Malvin is dead.

38:35.899 --> 38:38.569
Are you suggesting you might
have killed this Malvin?

38:39.570 --> 38:41.280
I don't remember what happened.

38:48.203 --> 38:49.830
I swear I'm telling the truth.

38:51.248 --> 38:54.001
I believe her. Especially
after what I saw tonight.

38:55.252 --> 38:57.629
Oh, come on.
We all saw it, didn't we?

39:00.382 --> 39:02.676
Promise me one thing, everyone.

39:05.137 --> 39:06.722
When the lights come,

39:08.015 --> 39:09.141
just run.

40:21.463 --> 40:22.464
Lyra.

40:48.532 --> 40:50.951
Yo, White Path. Get over here.

41:04.590 --> 41:06.425
This is a bad idea, Ridley.

41:06.508 --> 41:09.761
Man says he wants the container.
Odds are, Crystal has it.

41:10.345 --> 41:12.598
Crystal didn't know
what he was talking about.

41:14.057 --> 41:17.102
She has to have something.
Whether she knows it or not.

41:18.937 --> 41:20.230
What's gotten into you?

41:21.523 --> 41:23.066
Our lives have been threatened.

41:23.150 --> 41:24.693
And she might
have killed a guy.

41:24.776 --> 41:26.361
She might have killed
her own parents.

41:27.070 --> 41:28.530
I don't believe that.

41:28.614 --> 41:30.115
Well, you believe
what you want.

41:30.866 --> 41:32.618
I'll believe what I see.

42:25.921 --> 42:27.756
No one delivers on a Sunday.

42:29.258 --> 42:30.509
Careful, Zane.

42:35.222 --> 42:36.640
It's addressed to you.

42:45.148 --> 42:46.400
That belongs to Malvin.

42:47.734 --> 42:49.570
Sit down. Rest.

42:50.028 --> 42:52.030
Where's that sound coming from?

42:53.866 --> 42:55.325
Crystal, what's going on?

42:56.285 --> 42:57.870
You need to get away from me.

43:00.455 --> 43:01.748
Tell me so I can help.

43:01.832 --> 43:03.083
You need to get away.

43:03.166 --> 43:05.460
- Please tell me.
- Get away from me!

43:05.502 --> 43:08.463
- I'm not the bad guy!
- Get away from me!

43:13.635 --> 43:15.345
Caroline, step away
from Crystal.

43:15.429 --> 43:17.181
- No!
- I agree with your husband.

43:17.723 --> 43:19.600
What are you both nuts?

43:19.683 --> 43:21.101
You're going to believe
that horrible man

43:21.185 --> 43:22.477
over this poor girl?

43:22.561 --> 43:23.854
She could be dangerous.

43:23.937 --> 43:25.898
Crystal, listen to me.

43:27.024 --> 43:28.859
You care about
these folks, right?

43:35.365 --> 43:36.992
You and I need to go somewhere.

43:56.929 --> 43:58.889
He's a man in black
flesh and blood.

44:00.474 --> 44:02.768
When people claim
to be abducted by aliens,

44:04.394 --> 44:06.355
some of them say
they were paralyzed.

44:06.438 --> 44:07.940
I was not abducted.

44:13.612 --> 44:14.988
I'm not lying.

44:16.698 --> 44:18.408
I have no clue what to believe.

44:19.785 --> 44:21.662
Maybe you're a listener
of my show

44:21.745 --> 44:24.540
and decided to pull off
an elaborate hoax, I don't know.

44:39.680 --> 44:40.931
He died here.

44:42.140 --> 44:44.184
They killed him
and I couldn't stop it!

44:45.727 --> 44:48.230
Where is he?
Why isn't he here?

44:48.814 --> 44:53.235
Ridley, these portraits
were in my parents' house!

44:53.318 --> 44:55.821
I swear I'm not making
any of this up!

44:57.656 --> 44:59.074
Why are they here?

45:02.077 --> 45:04.246
Okay. Okay.

45:09.042 --> 45:11.211
Why don't you go back
to the truck?

45:12.880 --> 45:13.922
We're leaving.

45:14.548 --> 45:16.800
We'll have something
to eat, alright?

45:18.010 --> 45:20.179
And then we'll sit down
and try to reason this through.

45:59.801 --> 46:01.220
This mean anything to you?

46:02.387 --> 46:04.097
I'm having a hard time
figuring out

46:04.181 --> 46:07.142
what paranormal
bedroom invasions,

46:07.643 --> 46:09.603
men in black, UFOs,

46:09.686 --> 46:11.647
and British royal emblems
have to do

46:11.730 --> 46:13.440
with an orphan girl from Texas.

46:32.709 --> 46:34.211
Did you hear my phone just now?

46:36.922 --> 46:37.923
No.

46:49.685 --> 46:53.313
Sir, you can't park your truck
here all day long.

46:56.608 --> 46:58.360
Good thing I'm in a good mood.

46:59.903 --> 47:01.822
Next time, you'll be towed.

47:01.905 --> 47:04.491
Even with you two love birds
still sitting inside.

47:05.117 --> 47:06.118
Sorry.

47:07.911 --> 47:08.912
Ryan!

47:10.455 --> 47:12.583
Have we been in this truck
the entire time?

47:14.084 --> 47:15.586
You know the answer to that.

47:16.378 --> 47:18.172
Why don't you just rent a room

47:18.255 --> 47:20.007
instead of fulling around
in the truck all day?

47:21.008 --> 47:22.843
You're going
to get yourself arrested.

47:23.635 --> 47:24.636
Pervert.

47:31.310 --> 47:32.811
What the hell, Ridley?

47:32.895 --> 47:34.646
I've been trying to reach you
all afternoon.

47:34.730 --> 47:36.523
Bring Crystal back
to Zane's place.

47:36.607 --> 47:37.733
I'll meet you there.

47:45.240 --> 47:47.868
I think I'm being haunted
by spirits or something.

47:48.785 --> 47:50.787
You just don't want to say it
to the others out loud.

47:51.538 --> 47:53.123
You're a sharp girl, Crystal.

47:54.208 --> 47:55.959
I just want to record video
and audio of you

47:56.043 --> 47:57.628
meditating by yourself.

47:58.420 --> 48:01.340
My equipment will detect
the entire spectrum

48:01.423 --> 48:04.092
of the electro-magnetic
radiation surrounding you.

48:10.557 --> 48:13.393
Just because human beings
can't see invisible light,

48:14.978 --> 48:16.355
doesn't mean it isn't there.

48:17.523 --> 48:19.191
People get sunburned
on the beach.

48:22.569 --> 48:25.322
Now, if your eyes can tune in
to those frequencies,

48:26.990 --> 48:29.076
it'll be like seeing
into a parallel dimension.

48:30.369 --> 48:32.621
The objects and creatures
that share our space.

48:33.539 --> 48:35.123
They just cannot be touched.

48:36.083 --> 48:37.835
People say ignorance is bliss.

48:38.794 --> 48:40.254
Maybe they're right.

48:40.754 --> 48:42.965
Ignorance only works for people
not being chased

48:43.048 --> 48:44.842
by sinister men in black cars.

48:45.342 --> 48:48.762
Do you ever feel like you're
being followed or watched?

48:49.429 --> 48:50.472
But then you turn around

48:50.556 --> 48:52.349
and find yourself
completely alone?

48:52.432 --> 48:53.433
Always.

48:54.893 --> 48:56.812
Maybe it's time
we turn the tables.

49:01.149 --> 49:02.317
Now, listen.

49:03.277 --> 49:04.778
You're going to be alone
in the dark for a while.

49:05.654 --> 49:07.114
But you will be safe.

49:07.948 --> 49:08.949
Alright?

49:10.993 --> 49:11.994
Promise?

49:17.666 --> 49:20.794
If anything comes after you
in this world or the next,

49:21.837 --> 49:23.463
just repeat to yourself:

49:24.381 --> 49:26.258
I am with the great spirit.

49:26.717 --> 49:30.179
Inside here and here.

49:57.915 --> 49:59.791
What's with all
the ghostbusters equipment?

50:00.501 --> 50:02.628
Well, we can't sit around
playing defense.

50:03.420 --> 50:05.380
Eventually, whatever
is chasing Crystal

50:05.464 --> 50:06.590
is going to get her.

50:07.132 --> 50:09.927
Unless we identify it
and deal with it.

50:10.427 --> 50:11.720
Here's one clue.

50:13.347 --> 50:14.598
Funny, huh?

50:14.681 --> 50:16.808
I found a British
royal code of arms

50:16.892 --> 50:19.228
hanging in the room where
Crystal claimed that boy died.

50:19.811 --> 50:20.812
"Claimed?"

50:21.605 --> 50:23.148
What are you saying?
They never found the body?

50:23.774 --> 50:25.901
The enemy's got to be
flesh and blood.

50:26.902 --> 50:29.196
I mean, if they were ghosts,
why would they cover the tracks?

50:30.030 --> 50:32.074
Why clean up
evidence at the crime scene?

50:32.699 --> 50:33.700
They're human.

50:34.117 --> 50:35.744
I wouldn't be too sure
about that.

50:36.620 --> 50:37.913
Have a look at this.

50:38.497 --> 50:40.541
It's from the static recording
from last night.

50:45.587 --> 50:47.130
Notice the time in that video?

50:48.799 --> 50:49.967
Have a look at this.

50:50.050 --> 50:51.969
The HAARP facility in Alaska

50:52.052 --> 50:55.222
was active exactly the moment
we received the phone call

50:55.305 --> 50:57.140
from a so-called Mr. Cruel.

50:57.182 --> 51:00.143
Now, I bet if we timed all
the weird stuff happening

51:00.227 --> 51:01.270
to that girl,

51:01.353 --> 51:04.147
it would correspond exactly
to the spikes on this graph.

51:04.231 --> 51:06.233
What about today?

51:06.316 --> 51:10.028
Crystal and I lost 10 hours
of time this afternoon.

51:11.947 --> 51:13.866
We have no memory
of what happened.

51:14.700 --> 51:16.159
We may have been abducted.

51:16.535 --> 51:19.621
You're suggesting that aliens
abducted both of you

51:19.705 --> 51:20.747
in broad daylight

51:21.582 --> 51:22.666
at a diner?

51:24.168 --> 51:26.420
There it is. HAARP spikes today.

51:26.503 --> 51:29.506
At 1:11, 2:22, 4:44,

51:29.590 --> 51:31.592
and 11:11,
just before I called you.

51:31.758 --> 51:33.802
All corresponding
with the memory losses.

51:35.888 --> 51:36.889
Unbelievable.

51:38.140 --> 51:41.560
This huge conspiracy you guys
have concocted is insane!

51:41.727 --> 51:44.605
The government would be
hounding a poor orphan girl

51:45.230 --> 51:48.567
using a quarter billion dollar
facility in Alaska?

51:49.151 --> 51:51.528
I mean, you guys
are going off the deep end.

51:58.744 --> 52:01.079
I found this in Crystal's
suitcase that may be

52:01.163 --> 52:03.373
the container that Cruel's
been looking for.

52:17.012 --> 52:18.430
I think I know what's happening.

52:20.224 --> 52:21.934
She's being used as a gateway.

52:23.352 --> 52:25.020
It's an entity
from a different dimension.

52:29.191 --> 52:31.735
First, you guys are talking
alien abduction

52:31.818 --> 52:34.154
and now it's
interdimensional beings?

52:34.613 --> 52:35.906
Could make sense.

52:36.907 --> 52:39.326
Aliens would have to travel
faster than the speed of light

52:39.493 --> 52:40.494
to reach earth.

52:40.577 --> 52:43.247
By definition, it would make
them interdimensional.

52:43.622 --> 52:44.831
They're spirits.

52:44.915 --> 52:46.959
Oh, of course!

52:47.042 --> 52:50.003
Spirits are operating
a top secret government, uh,

52:50.087 --> 52:53.882
a government facility to torment
a poor little orphan girl.

52:53.966 --> 52:56.885
What next? What next?
Bodily possession?

52:56.969 --> 52:59.555
Perhaps we should get
a Catholic priest in here.

52:59.638 --> 53:01.348
No, no, no. Better.

53:01.431 --> 53:03.767
We should burn some sage brush

53:03.851 --> 53:06.562
and waft the smoke
around Crystal's head

53:06.645 --> 53:08.021
and get rid of all
the negative energy.

53:08.105 --> 53:10.649
Surely that would stop
the man in black.

53:10.732 --> 53:13.068
- Oh, would you shut up already?
- He's got a point.

53:13.151 --> 53:17.948
Let's suppose that aliens
are abducting people for real.

53:18.115 --> 53:20.409
- But why her?
- Maybe she was bred for it.

53:23.453 --> 53:24.872
Part of a bloodline.

53:48.103 --> 53:49.980
No one
is available to take your call.

53:50.063 --> 53:51.523
Please leave a message.

53:52.900 --> 53:54.526
Hi, Lyra. It's me.

53:57.613 --> 53:58.864
Really missed you today.

54:00.908 --> 54:03.493
Some really interesting
developments here.

54:04.995 --> 54:06.121
Call me back.

54:11.585 --> 54:14.838
No! No! No!

54:16.256 --> 54:19.426
No! Please!

54:35.984 --> 54:37.903
What's wrong?

54:37.986 --> 54:41.448
Have you forgotten
your childhood friend?

54:49.331 --> 54:50.791
This is Ridley Kay

54:50.874 --> 54:53.794
welcoming all our devoted
listeners to another night

54:53.877 --> 54:57.589
of strange happenings
and unexplainable phenomenon.

55:01.677 --> 55:04.096
I'm afraid my guest
Coslov couldn't be here tonight.

55:04.179 --> 55:05.180
She's...

55:06.640 --> 55:07.683
she's busy.

55:09.059 --> 55:12.271
The funny thing
about being a host

55:12.354 --> 55:14.022
of a paranormal radio show

55:14.815 --> 55:16.942
is the wide diversity
of experiences people

55:17.025 --> 55:18.151
bring to the table.

55:19.361 --> 55:22.322
Think about what that truly
means for a second.

55:22.489 --> 55:24.908
Last week,
we discussed HAARP and secret--

55:26.410 --> 55:28.328
...involving the
earth's atmosphere.

55:28.412 --> 55:32.708
Before that, we explored above
top secret government programs.

55:33.041 --> 55:37.212
And then, it was demonic
possessions and exorcisms.

55:37.379 --> 55:39.965
Secret bloodlines of the elite.

55:40.132 --> 55:45.262
And on, and on, and on.

55:46.054 --> 55:50.475
How can these various theories
be true all at the same time?

55:50.893 --> 55:53.645
All my guests were people
who're deeply convinced

55:53.729 --> 55:55.564
they experienced something real.

55:55.731 --> 55:58.775
We're all living in that
ancient Hindu parable

55:58.859 --> 56:00.652
taught to us in school.

56:00.736 --> 56:03.363
We're all blind in trying
to describe

56:03.530 --> 56:05.449
an elephant in the room
by touching it.

56:06.241 --> 56:07.784
A blind man touches the tail

56:07.868 --> 56:09.870
and says the paranormal
is like a rope.

56:10.662 --> 56:12.915
Another blind man
touches the trunk

56:12.998 --> 56:15.542
and says the paranormal
is like a tree branch.

56:17.085 --> 56:20.631
And then humanity fights over
which version is correct.

56:22.382 --> 56:25.719
Is there anyone looking
with eyes open?

56:27.387 --> 56:29.848
Is there anyone
who can see the whole elephant?

56:30.766 --> 56:33.727
Please call me. Please.

57:08.470 --> 57:09.471
Crystal?

57:12.474 --> 57:13.809
Crystal, are you awake?

57:41.837 --> 57:42.838
I'm sorry.

57:45.090 --> 57:46.341
I didn't believe you.

57:48.051 --> 57:49.219
It's alright.

57:50.387 --> 57:51.388
It's alright.

57:52.681 --> 57:54.016
You're safe now.

57:58.187 --> 58:00.272
East of the Rockies.
You're on Shadow House.

58:00.606 --> 58:01.648
Good evening.

58:02.065 --> 58:03.358
You sound familiar.

58:03.984 --> 58:07.154
This is the voice of the master,
you young amateur.

58:07.613 --> 58:08.906
Welcome back.

58:08.989 --> 58:10.908
I can't describe
the whole elephant,

58:10.991 --> 58:14.411
but I may be able to give you
another tiny piece.

58:14.578 --> 58:16.788
Well, I suppose that's the best
we can hope for.

58:16.872 --> 58:20.501
Actually, I saw an extremely
interesting relic.

58:20.584 --> 58:22.336
This little idol?

58:22.920 --> 58:23.921
Absolutely.

58:24.296 --> 58:25.631
A young lady had it.

58:25.797 --> 58:28.091
She called the show
last week begging for help.

58:28.175 --> 58:30.010
Yes, I remember her.

58:30.344 --> 58:31.595
What is this object?

58:31.678 --> 58:35.432
That is a statue of an ancient
Samarian god Enki.

58:35.516 --> 58:36.600
Don't know anything about him.

58:36.767 --> 58:38.185
Oh, but you do.

58:38.268 --> 58:40.729
You and all your listeners do.

58:40.812 --> 58:42.356
- Really?
- There's more to this

58:42.439 --> 58:44.399
ancient character
than meets the eye,

58:44.483 --> 58:47.361
but ancient cultures have
a long history

58:47.444 --> 58:49.154
involving strange abductions.

58:49.238 --> 58:51.698
It's a little hard
to make out what you're saying.

58:51.823 --> 58:53.909
You find very similar stories

58:54.076 --> 58:56.954
about shape-shifting
non-physical entities

58:57.037 --> 58:59.665
who abduct people
from all over the world.

58:59.998 --> 59:02.835
Fairies in Scotland
and Ireland,

59:02.918 --> 59:05.921
the strigoi in Romania,
and Eastern Europe,

59:06.088 --> 59:08.590
the yokai in Japan,

59:08.674 --> 59:11.218
Rakshasa in India

59:11.260 --> 59:14.137
They even exist
in Native American culture.

59:14.263 --> 59:16.765
Enki is one
of the original names

59:16.849 --> 59:20.519
for the fallen angel
that we call Lucifer.

59:23.313 --> 59:26.024
Are you implying
that ancient aliens

59:26.108 --> 59:30.654
were perhaps spiritual in nature
rather than extraterrestrial?

59:30.737 --> 59:33.740
Ask you friend White Path
about that.

59:35.701 --> 59:38.704
Are you still there?
Are you there?

59:42.666 --> 59:43.667
Typical.

59:44.001 --> 59:45.043
Can you hear me?

59:57.055 --> 59:59.057
You can't keep
Crystal locked up forever.

59:59.808 --> 01:00:01.059
It's obvious this...

01:00:01.685 --> 01:00:04.354
this man in black,
this Alister Cruel

01:00:04.438 --> 01:00:05.898
can track Crystal's movements.

01:00:06.899 --> 01:00:10.235
He must be using
some kind of tracking device.

01:00:10.861 --> 01:00:12.279
An implant or a chip.

01:00:12.446 --> 01:00:13.780
You wanted to run.

01:00:16.617 --> 01:00:18.076
Get the bug out of her.

01:00:19.161 --> 01:00:21.163
Get her away from here
with no one seeing.

01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:22.956
We give the girl some cash.

01:00:23.415 --> 01:00:26.585
She'll be free as a bird
if we get her far enough away.

01:00:26.668 --> 01:00:29.213
And how exactly will we get
an implant out of her?

01:00:30.923 --> 01:00:33.133
I worked as a nurse
for 20 years.

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.801
I can do that.

01:00:34.885 --> 01:00:38.305
No. I saw we make contact
and we record it.

01:00:38.472 --> 01:00:40.057
Find a way to give them
what they want

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:41.433
without giving them her.

01:00:41.517 --> 01:00:44.311
Then we expose it to the public.
That would protect Crystal.

01:00:44.853 --> 01:00:47.064
I get it! Finally, I get it!

01:00:47.147 --> 01:00:49.399
You don't care anything
about this girl.

01:00:49.483 --> 01:00:51.109
She's just a way for you
to find the truth

01:00:51.193 --> 01:00:52.402
with a capital T.

01:00:52.486 --> 01:00:54.488
It's your dream come true,
ain't it?

01:00:54.863 --> 01:00:57.115
It's your once
in a lifetime opportunity.

01:00:57.282 --> 01:00:59.243
I care more about Crystal
than you know.

01:00:59.326 --> 01:01:01.954
Yeah? Well, she's a little
young for you, don't you think?

01:01:02.037 --> 01:01:03.038
Guys?

01:01:04.206 --> 01:01:05.499
I like Zane's idea.

01:01:05.749 --> 01:01:07.209
Are you sure you want
to go ahead with this?

01:01:11.588 --> 01:01:13.632
Okay, can you stretch your arms
out for me?

01:01:20.305 --> 01:01:21.890
Look at the back
of her neck, numbskull.

01:01:25.477 --> 01:01:26.728
Something's transmitting.

01:01:33.652 --> 01:01:35.070
I can feel a tiny lump.

01:01:35.863 --> 01:01:36.989
What would you know about that?

01:01:37.739 --> 01:01:39.575
Didn't you ever watch X-Files?

01:01:41.994 --> 01:01:44.288
Miss McAllister, you need
to be very careful.

01:01:44.788 --> 01:01:46.373
It's extremely close
to her spine.

01:01:46.456 --> 01:01:47.499
Okay.

01:01:48.375 --> 01:01:50.419
Okay, can you take her hair
for me, please?

01:01:52.754 --> 01:01:53.881
There, too.

01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:55.591
Great.

01:02:02.806 --> 01:02:03.807
Okay.

01:02:06.643 --> 01:02:08.061
Okay. You sure you're ready?

01:02:08.687 --> 01:02:09.688
Okay, here we go.

01:02:11.356 --> 01:02:12.357
Okay.

01:02:34.421 --> 01:02:35.506
Can you feel that?

01:02:36.298 --> 01:02:37.883
It feels so weird.

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:41.386
Here it is, honey.

01:02:42.262 --> 01:02:43.263
Got it!

01:02:53.524 --> 01:02:54.900
Oh, god!

01:02:56.818 --> 01:02:58.529
There we go. Good girl.

01:02:58.612 --> 01:02:59.780
Brave girl.

01:03:00.364 --> 01:03:01.448
'Atta girl.

01:03:09.248 --> 01:03:10.999
I'll be praying
real hard for you.

01:03:16.713 --> 01:03:17.714
Here.

01:03:19.675 --> 01:03:21.009
Take care of yourself.

01:03:25.055 --> 01:03:27.099
I wish I had parents like you.

01:03:30.102 --> 01:03:32.896
My little girl disappeared
a few years ago.

01:03:33.146 --> 01:03:35.983
It was lovely to have
a young lady in the house again.

01:03:45.117 --> 01:03:46.743
- Here.
- Nah.

01:03:51.164 --> 01:03:52.165
Here.

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:55.335
Don't take it if you're going
to accidently shoot

01:03:55.419 --> 01:03:56.545
your balls off.

01:04:06.054 --> 01:04:07.055
We're going to figure this out.

01:04:08.265 --> 01:04:09.600
I promise.

01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:16.773
So Mexico.

01:04:16.857 --> 01:04:18.483
Crossover at El Paso
to Matamoros.

01:04:18.901 --> 01:04:20.569
Exactly what I was thinking.

01:04:21.069 --> 01:04:22.988
They're activating HAARP again.

01:04:25.866 --> 01:04:27.159
Cut the lights, quick!

01:04:29.328 --> 01:04:30.913
Okay, take the next right.

01:04:30.996 --> 01:04:32.456
It's a short cut.
Let's lose this guy

01:04:32.539 --> 01:04:33.665
and stay off the freeway.

01:04:41.798 --> 01:04:43.759
I told you.
I'm not leaving your side.

01:04:44.343 --> 01:04:45.844
God almighty.

01:04:45.928 --> 01:04:48.055
Would you let me have my way
just for once?

01:04:48.889 --> 01:04:50.807
This thing is bigger
than all of us.

01:04:51.308 --> 01:04:53.060
Stay with your sister
for a spell.

01:04:53.101 --> 01:04:55.020
I love you,
that's why I got to stay.

01:04:55.103 --> 01:04:57.439
I love you, too,
that's why you have to go.

01:05:53.412 --> 01:05:54.413
What the hell?

01:05:55.414 --> 01:05:57.082
Probably shit it out
in a few days.

01:06:09.887 --> 01:06:11.805
Can I turn the
head lights on again, please?

01:06:14.933 --> 01:06:17.060
I could drive a lot faster.

01:06:29.865 --> 01:06:30.866
Son of a--

01:06:42.753 --> 01:06:43.754
Malvin!

01:06:52.179 --> 01:06:54.598
Shit! Shit! I hit someone!

01:06:54.848 --> 01:06:56.308
I saw him go under
to the truck!

01:06:56.391 --> 01:06:57.476
There's blood on the front!

01:06:58.852 --> 01:07:00.020
Crystal, where are you going?
Come back!

01:07:01.063 --> 01:07:02.147
Wait here
and I'll bring her back.

01:07:04.942 --> 01:07:06.235
Come back here!

01:07:27.548 --> 01:07:28.549
Crystal?

01:07:32.302 --> 01:07:33.762
We should go back.

01:08:10.632 --> 01:08:13.802
Who are you?
Alister Cruel?

01:08:27.064 --> 01:08:28.066
Crystal.

01:08:28.942 --> 01:08:29.943
Crystal?

01:08:32.196 --> 01:08:33.197
Crystal.

01:08:34.031 --> 01:08:36.408
This place is evil.
We can't stay here.

01:08:38.535 --> 01:08:39.912
Come back with me.

01:08:41.997 --> 01:08:42.997
Mal?

01:08:49.087 --> 01:08:50.631
I'm here. Let me help you.

01:08:52.633 --> 01:08:53.634
Mal!

01:08:55.176 --> 01:08:59.139
Crystal? We need to leave now.

01:09:01.433 --> 01:09:02.850
You don't understand?

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.688
He's trapped here
because of me.

01:09:08.689 --> 01:09:10.526
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

01:09:10.609 --> 01:09:12.402
I didn't mean to.

01:09:14.529 --> 01:09:16.073
I have to free him.

01:09:17.323 --> 01:09:19.408
Crystal, there's no one here.

01:09:24.372 --> 01:09:27.125
No! Crystal, stay away from him!

01:09:27.292 --> 01:09:30.754
That's not Malvin.
It's a ritual site. Stop!

01:09:32.171 --> 01:09:33.173
No!

01:10:03.370 --> 01:10:04.788
What's wrong, Ridley?

01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:09.793
Did you forget all about me?

01:10:11.879 --> 01:10:13.046
Didn't I tell you?

01:10:13.714 --> 01:10:15.299
I'd be coming back for you.

01:10:17.801 --> 01:10:18.802
Ridley.

01:10:20.637 --> 01:10:23.682
You've been such a bad boy.

01:10:27.186 --> 01:10:31.231
Didn't I tell you never
to talk about these things?

01:10:31.315 --> 01:10:34.985
But you just couldn't
keep your mouth shut,

01:10:35.444 --> 01:10:36.528
could you?

01:10:37.446 --> 01:10:41.158
You just had to go
and broadcast it to the world.

01:10:41.241 --> 01:10:42.826
Who are you guys working for?

01:10:43.493 --> 01:10:45.621
And what the hell
are you talking about?

01:10:45.704 --> 01:10:47.539
What do you want
with that poor girl?

01:10:48.373 --> 01:10:51.460
Will your kind ever learn?

01:10:51.502 --> 01:10:55.130
Some things are simply
beyond your understanding.

01:10:56.507 --> 01:10:59.426
Every child should know
its limitations.

01:11:00.093 --> 01:11:03.722
But you keep on
overstepping yours.

01:11:04.181 --> 01:11:08.227
So now, I'm going
to have to punish you.

01:11:09.269 --> 01:11:11.480
Aren't I, Sam?

01:11:11.897 --> 01:11:13.440
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:11:15.776 --> 01:11:16.818
Stay back!

01:11:17.694 --> 01:11:19.279
I don't want any trouble.

01:11:19.363 --> 01:11:20.697
This gun is loaded.

01:11:20.781 --> 01:11:23.742
♪ The monarch flies
Across the sky ♪

01:11:23.825 --> 01:11:26.203
♪ To meet the angel
And his harp ♪

01:11:26.662 --> 01:11:29.456
♪ To sing the world
A lullaby ♪

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:32.292
♪ To stop the beating
Of its heart ♪

01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:35.254
Who the hell are you?

01:11:44.054 --> 01:11:45.931
You'd just shoot your own mom?

01:11:49.518 --> 01:11:50.894
How could you?

01:11:50.978 --> 01:11:53.397
After all
I've done for you?

01:11:54.481 --> 01:11:57.568
Who the hell or what are you?

01:12:20.632 --> 01:12:21.633
Crystal?

01:12:32.728 --> 01:12:34.855
I want you to keep away
from that girl.

01:12:37.399 --> 01:12:38.901
I'm going to give you
what you need.

01:12:54.458 --> 01:12:56.084
Crystal's the container.

01:13:04.593 --> 01:13:05.761
Crystal, no!

01:13:15.604 --> 01:13:17.856
Good girl, Crystal.

01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:20.025
My darling!

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:23.820
You did just fine!

01:13:24.988 --> 01:13:26.448
Now, finish him!

01:13:27.533 --> 01:13:30.327
Look, what do you guys want?

01:13:31.453 --> 01:13:32.579
Why are you doing this?

01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:36.166
Crystal, you don't have
to do this.

01:13:36.333 --> 01:13:37.459
You're not a killer.

01:13:37.835 --> 01:13:39.545
Surely you noticed
the butterflies.

01:13:40.462 --> 01:13:44.341
You knew what Crystal was
right from the start.

01:13:44.424 --> 01:13:48.220
We told you. We always tell
everyone the symbols

01:13:48.387 --> 01:13:49.888
are everywhere.

01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:57.646
It was you who took
my daughter, too!

01:13:59.314 --> 01:14:01.483
You bastard! What did you do
with my baby?

01:14:15.414 --> 01:14:19.042
You're breeding people
so you can possess them.

01:14:20.210 --> 01:14:22.004
That explains the abductions.

01:14:22.963 --> 01:14:25.465
The blood lineages
through the ages.

01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:28.510
Pulling the strings
of the people

01:14:28.594 --> 01:14:30.220
inserted as leaders.

01:14:32.139 --> 01:14:33.765
If it's any consolation,

01:14:33.849 --> 01:14:35.309
Crystal wasn't the killer.

01:14:35.767 --> 01:14:37.561
We simply placed
something inside her.

01:14:38.145 --> 01:14:40.272
Something we nurtured
and grew.

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:43.400
Where did you come from?

01:14:44.735 --> 01:14:46.945
What do you want from us?

01:14:52.034 --> 01:14:54.786
We've always been here.

01:14:59.291 --> 01:15:01.460
Since before your kind,

01:15:01.502 --> 01:15:04.213
we watched as you settled.

01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:06.340
Waited,

01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:12.346
wanted what we've always wanted
from every one before.

01:15:13.555 --> 01:15:16.767
Just that you'd live your life
as you would normally.

01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:20.646
Just do what seems natural
and easy,

01:15:20.729 --> 01:15:22.731
the path is wide and welcoming.

01:15:22.814 --> 01:15:24.608
It is already beneath your feet.

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:27.110
You just have to walk it.

01:15:28.028 --> 01:15:29.238
To enjoy it.

01:15:33.283 --> 01:15:34.785
You're a part of this anyway.

01:15:34.868 --> 01:15:38.205
Every human being,
whether you know it

01:15:38.997 --> 01:15:40.541
or not.

01:15:40.666 --> 01:15:42.125
I am with the great spirit.

01:15:42.584 --> 01:15:44.294
I am with the great spirit.

01:15:45.087 --> 01:15:47.172
I am with the great spirit.

01:15:47.256 --> 01:15:49.132
I am with the great spirit.

01:15:49.216 --> 01:15:51.260
I am with the great spirit.

01:15:52.845 --> 01:15:53.846
Ridley.

01:15:54.179 --> 01:15:56.306
Remember my
grandfather's stories.

01:15:57.558 --> 01:15:58.559
Silence!

01:15:59.101 --> 01:16:01.436
Who asked you to speak,
feather head?

01:16:03.981 --> 01:16:05.816
The lords of darkness!

01:16:07.359 --> 01:16:09.236
You're free from them!

01:16:10.988 --> 01:16:11.989
Crystal!

01:16:12.489 --> 01:16:14.199
Deny it in your body!

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:18.412
You are with the great spirit.
You are with the great spirit!

01:16:18.704 --> 01:16:20.664
- You are with the great spirit.
- I am with the great spirit!

01:16:26.044 --> 01:16:27.337
White Path!

01:16:37.931 --> 01:16:39.850
Don't die on me, god dammit.

01:17:22.976 --> 01:17:25.020
She belongs to me!

01:17:32.402 --> 01:17:35.280
I will visit you again soon.

01:17:35.697 --> 01:17:37.407
You be a good little boy.

01:17:46.124 --> 01:17:47.751
It's Cherokee Hope-hope.

01:17:48.544 --> 01:17:51.255
Crazy shame, and I thought
I'd lost you, buddy.

01:17:55.926 --> 01:17:57.052
What's that?

01:17:58.011 --> 01:17:59.179
Uncle Sam.

01:18:03.141 --> 01:18:04.268
Where's Crystal?

01:19:26.683 --> 01:19:28.227
What'd you do with my buddy?

01:19:31.313 --> 01:19:32.439
Am I under arrest?

01:19:35.234 --> 01:19:36.985
You going to charge me
with anything?

01:19:41.573 --> 01:19:43.617
Are you simply going
to make me vanish?

01:19:52.668 --> 01:19:54.711
Who the hell are you?

01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.716
Yo, dude. You hear me?

01:20:05.639 --> 01:20:07.224
What kind of game
are you guys playing?

01:20:07.891 --> 01:20:09.142
What the hell is this?

01:20:14.815 --> 01:20:17.484
I know all about you spooks.

01:20:19.695 --> 01:20:21.363
You're trying to read
my mind, aren't you?

01:20:23.615 --> 01:20:25.742
Not getting into my head, pal.

01:20:36.295 --> 01:20:38.380
You need to get some sleep, son.

01:20:39.506 --> 01:20:41.717
Nightmares keeping you
awake at night?

01:20:50.601 --> 01:20:52.186
What the hell
did you do to me?

01:20:54.021 --> 01:20:55.189
That's it?

01:21:00.652 --> 01:21:02.154
Thanks for nothing.

01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:05.991
Son of a--

01:21:32.601 --> 01:21:34.394
Back in the 1930s,

01:21:34.478 --> 01:21:36.647
Albert Einstein
tried to create

01:21:36.730 --> 01:21:39.608
a grand unified theory
of everything.

01:21:39.691 --> 01:21:41.902
One single equation
that would explain

01:21:41.985 --> 01:21:45.948
all of the seemingly
contradictory forces in physics,

01:21:46.031 --> 01:21:49.409
time, space, gravity,
and electromagnetism.

01:21:50.327 --> 01:21:53.205
Maybe that's what we need today.

01:21:53.288 --> 01:21:57.167
One big theory that proves
all of the paranormal together

01:21:57.251 --> 01:22:00.462
maybe everything
is somehow connected.
