01:29.590 --> 01:33.436
My name is Lea Clark,
and my presentation is on Brazil.

01:34.177 --> 01:37.647
I visited there last summer
with my family to see my brother Zac,

01:37.723 --> 01:39.691
who works at an animal sanctuary.

01:40.350 --> 01:43.570
Brazil is the largest
country in South America.

01:43.979 --> 01:46.152
The official language is Portuguese.

01:46.481 --> 01:50.076
Sixty percent of the Amazon's
rainforest is in Brazil.

01:50.319 --> 01:52.037
But those are just the book facts.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.990
To really learn about Brazil,
you must go there.

01:55.073 --> 01:57.121
And that's exactly what we did.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.203
Tell everybody about your hike!

01:59.286 --> 02:00.879
She totally saved her dad!

02:00.954 --> 02:02.456
Well, go on, Lea, tell us.

02:04.249 --> 02:07.423
We were on a hike,
high above the Praia Tropical.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.673
It was me, my dad, and my brother.

02:11.715 --> 02:13.968
Pick it up, Zac.
We gotta reach that point.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.553
We gotta hit that other edge.

02:15.719 --> 02:18.188
But the path unexpectedly narrowed

02:18.472 --> 02:22.852
and we found ourselves dangerously
close to enormous cliffs.

02:25.437 --> 02:28.361
We agreed we should turn back,
when suddenly,

02:28.732 --> 02:30.700
my father plummeted out of sight!

02:32.444 --> 02:36.665
Terrified, we looked down and there he was,

02:37.282 --> 02:41.669
dangling from a ledge, the rocks starting
to crumble underneath his fingertips,

02:41.912 --> 02:44.756
and not another person anywhere in sight.

02:45.374 --> 02:48.548
It was a race against time
as the sun was setting

02:48.835 --> 02:51.429
- and a sharp chill crept into the air.
- A chill?

02:51.505 --> 02:53.599
Isn't Brazil near the equator?

02:53.924 --> 02:55.096
Jimmy, sit down.

02:58.136 --> 03:00.264
With few options, I took off,

03:00.889 --> 03:03.859
back along the narrow,
dangerous trail to summon help,

03:03.934 --> 03:06.778
to the rescue station down in the valley.

03:08.605 --> 03:13.493
And just as it was beginning to get dark,
my dad and Zac were losing hope.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.363
Whoosh. Whoosh.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.741
A helicopter arrived to help.

03:18.824 --> 03:20.747
No way!

03:21.785 --> 03:23.458
This way. Come on!

03:32.796 --> 03:33.797
Over here!

03:34.631 --> 03:36.133
Right here.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.026
We lifted Dad to safety.

03:46.101 --> 03:47.899
Well, that is amazing, Lea.

03:47.978 --> 03:49.321
Thank you.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.648
You're totally a hero!

03:51.481 --> 03:54.405
No. I mean, I just did what I had to do.

03:54.484 --> 03:55.656
So cool!

03:55.736 --> 03:58.285
Yeah, right. Nice story, Pinocchio!

03:59.489 --> 04:01.583
- What?
- You got a good imagination, Lea.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.043
Leave her alone, Jimmy.

04:03.118 --> 04:06.213
All those pictures,
but none of the helicopter.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.257
That's, I...

04:09.332 --> 04:10.754
It's all true.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.086
I was there.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.344
- Sorry.
- No.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.050
- Go ahead.
- Zac!

04:19.134 --> 04:20.601
Hey, Cricket!

04:24.681 --> 04:26.024
Team Zea!

04:28.935 --> 04:31.029
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you in Brazil?

04:31.313 --> 04:32.781
This is so amazing.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.950
Did you hear my report?
We had to pick a country.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.698
And most of my friends chose...

04:38.028 --> 04:39.200
Are you the new Math teacher?

04:39.863 --> 04:41.706
Lea, this is Paula.

04:42.032 --> 04:45.286
Hi. I'm very excited to meet
Zachary's baby sister.

04:45.702 --> 04:46.794
Surprised?

04:48.246 --> 04:49.589
I sure am.

04:51.666 --> 04:54.135
Paula, your work sounds so fascinating.

04:54.211 --> 04:57.966
And what an honor to be flown
out here to speak for the weekend.

04:58.048 --> 05:02.056
Mom, Paula's an expert on the recent
changes in the Amazon's animal population.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.307
I wouldn't go that far.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.980
Well, I'm impressed.

05:06.473 --> 05:10.603
And now here we are. My first time
in the United States of America.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.896
Well, that's wonderful.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.989
And we're very pleased to have you here.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.066
Who's hungry?

05:17.067 --> 05:18.239
- I am.
- Good.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.161
Zac, would you take those salads
to the table for me?

05:20.237 --> 05:21.409
Sure, Mom.

05:21.488 --> 05:22.580
Thank you.

05:25.951 --> 05:28.955
I'm so glad we caught you before
you go off white-water rafting.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.624
I still don't understand. Why can't I go?

05:31.915 --> 05:33.383
It's a bunch of middle-aged dads!

05:33.667 --> 05:35.044
And the rapids are pretty wild.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.469
I'm tough.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.343
- And a good swimmer.
- I know you are, sweetheart.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.094
But if you were to come along,

05:40.173 --> 05:43.302
then Eric would bring Sarah
and Sam would bring the twins...

05:43.385 --> 05:45.763
Okay. I guess I'll stay home.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.565
Paula, is your family from Manaus?

05:49.641 --> 05:52.360
Yes, my sisters and I were born there.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.904
My grandfather was born in Brazil.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.899
- Really?
- Did he tell you that?

05:57.274 --> 06:00.824
I know your mother Ama
came to Brazil many times.

06:01.236 --> 06:02.863
She worked at a health clinic in Manaus.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.869
Oh, it's not far from the sanctuary.

06:05.073 --> 06:08.418
That's why Zac chose to do
his work there, because of my mom.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.539
She must have been an amazing woman.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.545
She met real Indians in the rain forest,

06:14.666 --> 06:16.589
- who ate bugs and lived and lived in huts.
- Okay, but... But...

06:16.668 --> 06:18.716
- And they went...
- Okay.

06:18.795 --> 06:21.548
Your grandmother told you
that story was a hallucination

06:21.631 --> 06:23.975
from the anti-malaria medication, honey.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.642
My mom gave the kids
their sense of adventure,

06:31.766 --> 06:34.485
and her journals,
which Lea has been reading.

06:34.603 --> 06:35.855
It would be unlikely.

06:35.937 --> 06:40.191
Most of the people in the rainforest try
to avoid contact with the outside world.

06:40.609 --> 06:44.239
Their isolation is important
for preserving their culture.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.664
It's still a good story.

06:49.993 --> 06:52.087
Paula, is your steak cooked enough?

06:52.162 --> 06:54.005
Or can I put it back on the grill?

06:54.289 --> 06:56.041
Dad, Paula's a vegetarian.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.798
Why didn't you say something?

06:59.878 --> 07:02.301
It's okay. It's fine. I asked him not to.

07:02.380 --> 07:05.680
The vegetables are delicious.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.637
Can I have hers, Dad? The steak rocks.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.267
Absolutely, sweetie.

07:34.245 --> 07:39.384
So, I come all this way
and you're hiding in your room?

07:39.793 --> 07:41.636
Reading a geometry book?

07:41.711 --> 07:43.384
I have a test next week.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.181
Shouldn't you be out there
with your girlfriend?

07:45.757 --> 07:47.054
I heard

07:47.258 --> 07:51.434
that somebody's favorite sloth
is back to her tip-top lazy self.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.057
Amelia?

07:55.225 --> 07:56.568
That's such great news.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.442
You know, you... You saved her life.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.738
Paula seems nice.

08:05.694 --> 08:07.913
It's too bad you're only in Brazil
for another few months.

08:08.738 --> 08:09.955
Well...

08:11.032 --> 08:15.082
You coming back when
your grant is over. Right?

08:15.620 --> 08:18.089
I'm doing important work in Brazil.

08:18.748 --> 08:22.719
You're gonna leave me forever
and move across the world for a girl?

08:22.794 --> 08:23.920
What about college?

08:24.004 --> 08:25.096
Mom and Dad are going to...

08:25.171 --> 08:26.468
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

08:26.548 --> 08:29.427
There is an excellent
university in Manaus.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.307
I can't believe this.

08:38.058 --> 08:39.777
Can you keep a secret?

08:41.354 --> 08:44.403
No. I'm serious, this is really important.

08:45.608 --> 08:46.655
Okay.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.863
You know those poachers I told you about?

08:50.071 --> 08:52.574
The ones who've been stealing
animals from the rainforest.

08:52.907 --> 08:56.161
They broke into the sanctuary
and I've been tracking them.

08:56.244 --> 08:57.336
What?

08:57.454 --> 08:58.956
I found something.

08:59.039 --> 09:03.464
I actually think I'm this close
to pinpointing one of their main routes.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.420
That is so cool.

09:06.755 --> 09:07.972
Why is it such a big secret?

09:08.131 --> 09:10.975
Well, these guys,
they are really powerful.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.473
You mean dangerous?

09:12.552 --> 09:13.804
Zac, you should tell someone.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.059
I'm telling you.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.482
I mean like your boss or the police.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.809
No. Not until I'm sure.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.279
What does Paula think?

09:25.273 --> 09:26.900
She doesn't know.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.278
So, come on.

09:29.652 --> 09:32.496
No chirping about this one. Okay, Cricket?

09:33.656 --> 09:34.908
Team Zea?

09:34.991 --> 09:36.163
Team Zea.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.547
I've missed you, too.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.263
Thank you so much for everything.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.806
Safe trip.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.637
Come on, you're gonna be late.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.063
I love you.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.228
Be careful, okay?

10:03.561 --> 10:04.904
Yes, ma'am.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.791
Has anyone seen my headlamp?

10:16.866 --> 10:18.868
Front pocket of your duffle.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.213
- Nope. Not here.
- Other front pocket.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.715
Second thought,
maybe I should take you along.

10:28.753 --> 10:29.925
Not a chance.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.515
Us girls have some serious R&R in store.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.888
Okay. Thank you, sweetheart.

10:37.554 --> 10:38.521
Hey, Big Joe.

10:38.596 --> 10:39.597
Hey, Rick.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.814
- Hey.
- Hi, girls.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.608
Here we go, thank you.

10:49.399 --> 10:50.696
Come here, little popcorn.

10:51.234 --> 10:54.113
So just call us
when you get back to civilization.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.868
- Okay?
- Roger that.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.458
Bye, Dad. Bye, Joe.

10:59.868 --> 11:02.087
- Bye.
- Bye, girls. See you in a week.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.830
We're gonna play,

11:05.206 --> 11:06.753
as soon as they get out of here.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.014
And pose.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.526
Be the mother.

11:32.984 --> 11:36.204
I also hadn't had those peanut butter cups

11:36.487 --> 11:40.283
in so long and, I will believe you next time.

11:40.575 --> 11:41.952
I've got it.

11:43.703 --> 11:44.704
Hello.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.164
Oh.

11:46.289 --> 11:48.132
Hi, Paula... Paula.

11:48.791 --> 11:51.089
Um, yeah. She's right here.

11:53.588 --> 11:56.933
Well hey, Paula.
It's good to hear from you.

12:02.013 --> 12:03.811
Have you talked to his boss?

12:05.433 --> 12:07.936
Um, I'm gonna call you back, all right?

12:13.066 --> 12:16.161
Hi, sweetheart, it's Mom.
I'm just checking in.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.154
I love you. Call me back.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.156
What's going on?

12:23.493 --> 12:24.745
Hey, honey, it's me.

12:24.827 --> 12:27.205
Um, I don't know if you're
completely out of range or what

12:27.288 --> 12:29.837
but, um, give me a call as soon
as you get this. Thank you. Bye.

12:29.916 --> 12:30.917
Mom.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.094
Mom.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.217
Uh...

12:35.296 --> 12:37.264
Mom, is something wrong?

12:37.674 --> 12:40.348
Paula hasn't heard
from Zac in a couple days.

12:41.511 --> 12:44.811
Maybe he's just realized
she's not the right girl for him.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.358
Apparently, he hasn't shown up
for work either.

12:47.558 --> 12:50.357
Maybe he just needs some space
or he's avoiding her.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.438
- Or...
- Hi. Is this Bruno?

12:53.731 --> 12:56.530
Hi, Bruno. This is Carol Clark, Zac's mom.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.242
Um... No. Yeah, that's what I heard.

13:00.363 --> 13:02.036
Um, listen, do me a favor.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.710
Could you please give me
the number for the local police?

13:08.329 --> 13:09.626
All right.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.383
Okay. Thank you so much.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.753
Mom. Is Zac okay?

13:15.044 --> 13:18.048
Uh... I'm not sure. I hope so.

13:23.261 --> 13:25.559
Hello. Excuse me, do you speak English?

13:25.638 --> 13:26.730
Uh, yes.

13:26.806 --> 13:30.185
Okay. My son has been working in Manaus,

13:30.351 --> 13:32.774
and I've been having trouble reaching him.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.188
Uh, okay.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.741
I'm concerned he might be missing.

13:40.695 --> 13:41.947
He is 20.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.037
Two days.

13:50.663 --> 13:51.664
Wow.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.169
Hello.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.092
Hi, is this you I just called?

13:58.171 --> 13:59.172
Please, don't hang up.

13:59.255 --> 14:02.134
Please, please, please.
Don't hang up. Are you there?

14:02.216 --> 14:03.217
Hello.

14:07.847 --> 14:08.848
Lea, listen...

14:08.931 --> 14:09.978
It's the poachers.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.439
- What?
- What if they figured it out?

14:12.518 --> 14:14.020
What if they found out?

14:14.103 --> 14:16.777
What if they realized what he was doing?

14:16.856 --> 14:18.278
I don't know what you're talking about.

14:18.483 --> 14:22.454
He told me not to say anything
but he was trying to find them.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.238
Find who?

14:24.322 --> 14:25.414
The poachers.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.125
Okay, honey.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.498
I need you to focus.

14:29.577 --> 14:32.046
I need to get us on the 6:00 flight, okay?

14:32.121 --> 14:35.000
So, I need you to get your stuff together
and pack a bag. We've got to go.

14:38.211 --> 14:41.340
- But...
- I need you to just act fast, okay?

14:41.798 --> 14:43.391
Be swift, kiddo.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.102
Got it?

14:47.428 --> 14:50.056
I need you to move, okay? Thank you.

15:48.698 --> 15:49.790
Lea.

15:59.542 --> 16:00.759
So. Any news?

16:00.877 --> 16:03.551
Well, we still haven't heard from him.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.472
Could he have been in an accident?

16:05.548 --> 16:06.891
We checked all the hospitals.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.014
Luis is another of our young interns.

16:09.343 --> 16:10.469
Olá, Mrs. Clark.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.521
- You haven't heard from him?
- No, not yet.

16:12.638 --> 16:16.313
So, tell me, where do kids go? I mean,
he could not have just disappeared.

16:16.392 --> 16:20.022
With all due respect,
Mrs. Clark, Zachary is not a child.

16:20.271 --> 16:24.492
Well, he's my child. And he works
for you, and he's missing.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.165
I'm sorry.

16:32.033 --> 16:34.001
It's been a really long night.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.077
I can imagine.

16:39.248 --> 16:42.092
That is Zachary's work space right there.

16:43.294 --> 16:45.547
My staff are anxious to help.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.603
What about the poachers?

16:55.681 --> 16:56.807
Poachers?

16:56.974 --> 16:59.727
Lea is convinced that Zac's
been trying to find them.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.689
Oh, Zachary knows that
is dangerous business.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.944
We let the police handle
those sorts of things.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.702
Your brother knows better than that.

17:07.777 --> 17:08.868
What did I tell you?

17:08.944 --> 17:12.790
Twenty-year-old boys do not go
looking after poachers on their own.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.833
Your brother would never be that reckless.

17:16.243 --> 17:18.541
Can I get you some breakfast?

17:18.621 --> 17:19.667
Just a second.

17:23.542 --> 17:27.423
Paula. Yeah... Oh, wonderful.
Okay, we'll be... We'll be right there.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.598
Lea, let's go.

17:40.351 --> 17:41.398
Paula.

17:41.477 --> 17:42.524
Hi.

17:58.869 --> 18:02.794
I gotta go to the police.
Do you mind if Lea stays here with you?

18:02.873 --> 18:04.796
- What?
- Yes, of course.

18:05.334 --> 18:06.586
Mom, I'm coming with you.

18:06.669 --> 18:07.841
Please, honey.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.631
I don't need a babysitter.

18:09.714 --> 18:12.638
I know, but I don't wanna
have an argument, okay?

18:12.967 --> 18:15.641
Why bring me all this way if I'm
just gonna sit here and do nothing?

18:15.720 --> 18:17.267
You know what, you're right.

18:17.346 --> 18:20.395
You're absolutely right.
I did not plan this very well, did I?

18:20.600 --> 18:22.694
But here we are, and I really need now

18:22.768 --> 18:24.395
for you to co-operate with me, okay?

18:24.520 --> 18:27.649
- Don't worry, we'll be fine.
- Thank you.

18:50.087 --> 18:51.213
So...

18:51.714 --> 18:55.514
Do you want to draw or play a game?

18:55.718 --> 18:57.391
Seriously?

18:57.803 --> 18:59.180
I wanna find my brother.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.389
Okay.

19:00.556 --> 19:03.901
Listen to me, try to relax.
I'm sure he's fine. He's probably just...

19:03.976 --> 19:05.478
Probably what?

19:10.107 --> 19:11.199
If you thought he was fine,

19:11.275 --> 19:13.949
we wouldn't have traveled all
through the night just to get here.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.744
How about a snack, hmm?

19:17.490 --> 19:20.289
I'm not five. I'm 10.

19:20.368 --> 19:23.463
And I can't just sit here and do nothing.

19:26.415 --> 19:29.009
I know he's over 18,

19:29.085 --> 19:31.679
but he is not the kind of kid that...

19:31.921 --> 19:35.892
Oh! He's not the kind of person
that doesn't call.

19:35.966 --> 19:38.014
He always calls.

19:38.094 --> 19:40.347
Dona Carol, maybe he's angry with you?

19:40.429 --> 19:43.023
No, he's not angry with me,
he's not a runaway.

19:43.099 --> 19:47.445
I am sorry, but with no signs of foul play
the best thing I can do is add to the pile.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.318
And maybe you can come back in a week.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.944
What's the problem?

20:03.160 --> 20:06.755
Uh-uh. Lea, uh, you should not
be snooping through his things.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.128
You're snooping on his computer.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.505
I'm constructing a timeline
of the last few days.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.511
Lea.

20:35.401 --> 20:36.653
He had a notebook.

20:36.736 --> 20:40.240
It was black and skinny
and had little red markings on it.

20:40.322 --> 20:41.539
I don't know.

21:06.474 --> 21:08.397
I went to his place of work.

21:08.476 --> 21:11.571
I spoke to his boss,
they haven't seen or heard from him.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.235
Is he at the girlfriend's place?

21:14.315 --> 21:17.740
No, no, he... My son is missing.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.407
Is there another girl?

21:23.574 --> 21:27.169
No, he hasn't gone
to any other girl. He's...

21:27.244 --> 21:30.544
Something's wrong, I know it.

21:35.044 --> 21:36.170
Just a moment.

21:36.253 --> 21:37.300
Okay.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.274
Let's go.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.862
These are his leads.

22:05.241 --> 22:09.212
No. He stopped with the poachers
a long time ago.

22:09.286 --> 22:12.256
What if he told you that
so that you wouldn't worry?

22:15.709 --> 22:16.801
Look!

22:17.336 --> 22:20.556
There are addresses in here, and names.
We should check them out.

22:20.631 --> 22:22.133
Or at least drive by.

22:22.758 --> 22:25.853
Lea, your mother told us to stay put.

22:26.428 --> 22:28.021
If it's nothing then we'll come back.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.187
But we can't just sit here.

22:31.058 --> 22:33.686
We can't just sit here and do nothing.

22:36.438 --> 22:37.564
Okay.

22:38.315 --> 22:39.441
Okay.

22:43.612 --> 22:44.955
Thank you.

23:39.209 --> 23:40.631
There it is.

23:54.642 --> 23:56.895
Zac's secret research was a plan

23:56.977 --> 24:00.857
to buy trinkets to bring back
for friends and family.

24:06.654 --> 24:08.531
These bracelets are beautiful.

24:09.823 --> 24:11.541
Do you want to try one?

24:11.617 --> 24:14.416
They're wish bracelets.
Tie one on and make a wish.

24:18.248 --> 24:20.671
I'm telling him we're looking for someone.

24:22.419 --> 24:24.467
I'm sorry, I don't recognize him.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.548
He's my brother and he's missing.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.976
Oh, that's terrible.

24:29.051 --> 24:30.553
Have you spoken to the police?

24:30.636 --> 24:32.730
Yes, they've been notified.

24:32.846 --> 24:34.974
You know, why don't you
give me your number?

24:35.057 --> 24:36.104
In case he does come in.

24:47.528 --> 24:48.620
Here.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.323
A little gift.

24:51.573 --> 24:53.246
We can use any help we can get.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.668
That's right.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.094
Look!

25:04.253 --> 25:05.345
Look! Look!

25:05.462 --> 25:07.089
What?

25:07.172 --> 25:08.719
The paw print. In the bottom corner.

25:08.799 --> 25:11.018
It's all over Zac's notebook.

25:11.427 --> 25:13.600
That can't be a coincidence.

25:15.431 --> 25:16.523
Okay.

25:17.558 --> 25:18.605
Put your helmet on.

26:22.581 --> 26:23.582
Oh!

26:28.337 --> 26:29.338
Aye!

26:35.344 --> 26:36.311
What?

26:36.386 --> 26:38.730
The tire is completely flat.

26:38.806 --> 26:40.149
Well, then we've gotta go.

26:40.432 --> 26:43.606
Oh, yeah? Are you going to trek
across the Amazon on foot?

26:43.685 --> 26:44.811
No...

26:45.104 --> 26:46.276
But we can't...

26:46.355 --> 26:48.858
Look, Lea, please listen to me, okay?

26:49.441 --> 26:53.571
I want to find your brother
just as badly as you do, okay?

26:53.862 --> 26:55.034
But this is not the way.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.041
Who are you calling?

27:06.583 --> 27:08.802
No one. I can't keep a signal.

27:08.877 --> 27:10.595
Well, we can't lose that truck.

27:10.671 --> 27:13.299
Lea, you know nothing about the Amazon!

27:13.382 --> 27:15.976
Do you have any idea how dangerous it is?

27:16.051 --> 27:18.179
Even if we were remotely dressed for it...

27:18.262 --> 27:20.390
Then it's a good thing
I'm with an "expert."

27:20.889 --> 27:23.017
Lea! Lea!

27:23.517 --> 27:25.485
"Oh, you're going to love my sister."

27:25.561 --> 27:28.656
"She's got a great imagination.
She's got spunk."

27:28.730 --> 27:31.074
Just stop it right now. Lea!

27:31.191 --> 27:34.445
Lea, stop it. We need to go back
before it's gets too late

27:34.528 --> 27:37.748
and your mother realizes
you've kidnapped me.

27:38.740 --> 27:39.832
Lea!

27:42.244 --> 27:43.746
Hey, Lea!

27:45.956 --> 27:47.924
Please, listen to me.

27:55.716 --> 27:56.717
The truck!

28:05.267 --> 28:08.362
The final call on Zac's cell phone
came from this office.

28:08.437 --> 28:10.155
- What does that mean?
- Maybe nothing.

28:10.272 --> 28:11.740
But it was after hours.

28:11.857 --> 28:15.862
Excuse me, Bruno, who worked here
late the night Zac went missing?

28:15.944 --> 28:18.447
- Uh...
- That was me. I called him.

28:18.780 --> 28:20.327
Sorry, I didn't think anything of it.

28:20.407 --> 28:23.377
I invited him out to hear a band.
Good dance music.

28:23.493 --> 28:25.120
- We like to go and have fun.
- What did he say?

28:25.454 --> 28:28.424
He was already out.
I assume he was with Paula.

28:31.418 --> 28:33.045
That's okay. Go ahead.

28:33.128 --> 28:35.472
I'm sorry I can't be
more help, Mrs. Clark.

28:35.923 --> 28:38.426
You know, there's a club down
the street he likes, Noites Quentes.

28:38.508 --> 28:40.010
Do you think he could have
been there Tuesday night?

28:40.219 --> 28:41.391
It's possible.

28:41.470 --> 28:42.596
They open at 9:00.

28:42.679 --> 28:43.771
We'll be there.

28:43.847 --> 28:46.066
Thank you, Luis. Thank you, Bruno.

28:59.863 --> 29:02.582
Ah! Do you know what's in that water?

29:02.658 --> 29:06.003
Piranhas, anacondas,
black caimans, leeches.

29:06.286 --> 29:09.165
I'm trying not to
think about that right now.

29:09.248 --> 29:12.343
Besides, don't you study
the rainforest for work?

29:12.501 --> 29:15.675
I don't do field studies.
I work in the lab.

29:15.754 --> 29:18.098
I analyze data and report my findings.

29:18.173 --> 29:20.722
That's not really helpful right now.

29:20.926 --> 29:24.681
This wasn't my idea, remember?

29:26.348 --> 29:29.443
Did you hear anything I said, Lea?

29:32.771 --> 29:34.114
Lea Clark.

29:34.356 --> 29:36.450
Whatever you are thinking...

29:36.525 --> 29:40.371
It's time to stop thinking and just do.

29:56.461 --> 29:57.929
Ah!

29:58.213 --> 30:00.215
What does that even mean?

30:02.926 --> 30:04.769
It means pineapples.

30:06.221 --> 30:08.269
- Pineapples?
- Yes.

30:10.475 --> 30:11.818
Pineapples.

30:16.523 --> 30:17.775
I'm fine.

30:18.066 --> 30:20.319
It was, um... It was just a cramp.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.452
See. That wasn't so bad.

31:11.036 --> 31:13.664
- I should've eaten a bigger breakfast.
- Oh!

31:14.164 --> 31:15.632
You didn't pack snacks?

31:16.833 --> 31:20.428
Oh, those look tasty and delicious.

31:20.670 --> 31:23.173
Juicy and delicious.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.303
Don't!

31:25.050 --> 31:26.347
What's the big deal?

31:26.426 --> 31:28.269
That's a Strychnos. It could kill you.

31:29.221 --> 31:30.393
All right.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.309
You saved me.

31:35.143 --> 31:36.486
Thank you.

31:45.862 --> 31:49.457
If we go much further, I don't know
if we'll be able to make it out at all.

31:49.533 --> 31:51.786
And it gets dark quickly here.

31:51.868 --> 31:53.711
Why are you always this negative?

31:53.787 --> 31:55.334
I'm a realist.

31:56.206 --> 32:00.131
Then you know Zac's moving back
in a couple of months, right?

32:00.210 --> 32:02.838
Well, if that's what he decides.

32:03.672 --> 32:05.265
Oh, he will.

32:05.340 --> 32:06.717
He told you this?

32:06.800 --> 32:08.973
He really misses his family

32:09.511 --> 32:11.058
and his friends.

32:27.028 --> 32:28.530
- Now, you've done it.
- Oh, me?

32:28.613 --> 32:31.958
Yes, you! You're so busy trying
to get me upset about your brother.

32:32.033 --> 32:33.285
You think this is my fault?

32:33.368 --> 32:35.211
I'm not the one who screamed like a baby.

32:35.328 --> 32:37.797
And, by the way,
are you seriously afraid of spiders?

32:37.873 --> 32:39.170
Aren't you a scientist?

32:39.249 --> 32:41.502
Everybody's afraid of something.

32:41.585 --> 32:45.135
If you had just listened to me and let me
continue searching through his emails.

32:45.213 --> 32:49.013
Newsflash, Zac's not in his computer.

32:49.092 --> 32:50.719
He's out here!

33:02.522 --> 33:03.523
What?

33:03.773 --> 33:04.899
Don't say anything.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.781
What's your plan, pretend we're not here?

33:06.860 --> 33:09.659
The tribes don't trust us,
we are outsiders.

33:12.532 --> 33:14.330
She's just a kid.

33:14.451 --> 33:15.828
We're on their land.

33:15.911 --> 33:17.879
We look like the enemy.

33:25.754 --> 33:27.552
She's here to help.

33:39.809 --> 33:40.810
Run!

33:41.311 --> 33:42.688
Go, go, go!

33:44.439 --> 33:48.610
Now would be a great time for you
to concoct one of your brilliant plans.

33:50.195 --> 33:51.287
Run!

34:06.294 --> 34:07.887
We come in peace.

34:12.634 --> 34:13.806
Knock, knock.

34:18.723 --> 34:19.940
Knock, knock.

34:22.518 --> 34:23.940
Who's there?

34:24.563 --> 34:25.655
Boo.

34:27.399 --> 34:28.616
Boo, who?

34:29.693 --> 34:30.694
Ha, ha.

34:30.902 --> 34:31.902
Boo, boo.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.158
Boo, boo.

34:36.408 --> 34:37.955
Funny!

34:45.833 --> 34:48.632
Very, very funny.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.467
Funniest ever.

34:56.428 --> 34:57.429
Okay, there.

35:01.266 --> 35:02.267
Ah...

35:05.812 --> 35:06.813
Aki.

35:08.523 --> 35:09.524
I'm Lea

35:09.649 --> 35:10.866
and this is Paula.

35:10.942 --> 35:12.615
We are looking for my brother.

35:17.699 --> 35:19.451
You should not be here!

35:19.534 --> 35:23.877
I know, I know, but we were looking
for her brother and we got lost.

35:25.582 --> 35:27.300
Wait, you speak English?

35:27.459 --> 35:28.802
How do you speak English?

35:28.877 --> 35:30.845
Father was tribe leader.

35:31.296 --> 35:33.048
He told outsiders, go away!

35:33.131 --> 35:34.508
He afraid they come back.

35:34.591 --> 35:36.059
He want me ready.

35:36.718 --> 35:38.937
Portuguese makes sense, but...

35:39.721 --> 35:40.813
English?

35:40.889 --> 35:42.015
One day we fishing.

35:42.349 --> 35:43.817
There's a bag.

35:45.560 --> 35:46.561
Backpack?

35:47.103 --> 35:49.151
Dictionary, books, radio.

35:49.230 --> 35:50.447
I read.

35:52.067 --> 35:53.489
You taught yourself English?

35:53.568 --> 35:54.820
With father.

35:55.236 --> 35:56.237
Whoa!

35:59.574 --> 36:00.700
Let me see your phone.

36:01.618 --> 36:05.714
This is my brother, Zac.

36:06.039 --> 36:07.382
He's missing.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.084
We think poachers took him.

36:09.542 --> 36:11.590
Bad guys, outsiders...

36:11.878 --> 36:12.925
Poachers?

36:13.088 --> 36:14.260
Bad guys?

36:14.422 --> 36:15.423
I take you.

36:15.799 --> 36:16.925
So, you've seen him?

36:17.092 --> 36:18.594
I see bad guys.

36:19.344 --> 36:20.561
I help find.

36:24.599 --> 36:25.771
Come on.

36:29.354 --> 36:30.571
Danger.

36:32.273 --> 36:33.570
Lesson learned.

36:46.955 --> 36:47.956
Uh...

36:48.957 --> 36:49.958
Ah!

37:04.264 --> 37:05.686
This was a bad idea.

37:05.765 --> 37:07.984
You said we needed an expert
and it seems like we found one.

37:10.353 --> 37:11.980
Shoes off, more easy.

37:12.272 --> 37:13.319
Please.

37:22.657 --> 37:23.658
No!

37:23.742 --> 37:25.790
No, no, no, no! Lea!

37:44.637 --> 37:45.889
Let's go.

37:48.683 --> 37:51.607
We should say thank you
for her time and say adeus.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.529
I'm not turning back.

37:53.855 --> 37:55.232
I trust her.

38:28.515 --> 38:29.732
Sit.

38:31.559 --> 38:32.560
Uh-uh!

38:33.603 --> 38:34.855
No way.

38:51.454 --> 38:52.455
Do you have a signal?

38:53.122 --> 38:55.090
No, I had a bar.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.384
Sit, sit, sit.

39:05.093 --> 39:06.094
Lea.

39:06.594 --> 39:07.766
Lea.

39:09.097 --> 39:10.440
This is insane.

39:11.266 --> 39:12.859
This is insane.

39:27.615 --> 39:28.616
Come on!

39:29.075 --> 39:30.372
You can do it!

39:30.451 --> 39:31.452
Whoo!

39:31.828 --> 39:33.922
You can do it!

39:34.163 --> 39:35.665
Sit, sit.

39:57.812 --> 40:00.190
Well, you did it.

40:00.690 --> 40:02.033
Bad way.

40:07.196 --> 40:08.823
Are those stairs?

40:09.991 --> 40:11.584
That way no fun!

40:31.763 --> 40:34.607
I'd feel a lot better if anyone
knew where we were going.

40:38.019 --> 40:39.862
Was that them? Is that the poachers?

40:39.938 --> 40:41.315
Worse. My mother.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.992
Perfect, I'm sure
she'll be thrilled to see us.

40:44.067 --> 40:45.535
She not happy.

40:46.235 --> 40:47.236
Oh!

40:49.697 --> 40:51.699
What are you doing?
Shouldn't we hide or something?

40:51.783 --> 40:53.535
Yes, yes, yes, go!

41:33.366 --> 41:34.618
Now I have service.

41:36.953 --> 41:38.125
It's your mom.

41:44.836 --> 41:45.928
Mom.

41:48.840 --> 41:49.841
Mom?

41:49.924 --> 41:51.267
Hello, Lea?

41:52.010 --> 41:53.011
Hey!

41:53.720 --> 41:55.313
Can you hear me?

41:55.638 --> 41:56.685
Are you there?

41:56.806 --> 41:57.807
Lea.

41:58.599 --> 41:59.725
Can you hear me?

41:59.809 --> 42:04.147
Okay, I just talked to Dad
and he's flying in tomorrow night.

42:04.272 --> 42:05.649
Hello, Mom?

42:05.773 --> 42:08.572
Lea, Lea, tell her to call the police.

42:09.027 --> 42:10.529
Are you there?

42:10.695 --> 42:11.947
Is everything okay?

42:12.030 --> 42:14.283
I don't know, it's such a bad connection.

42:14.407 --> 42:16.956
Mom, Paula and I are kind
of in a bit of pickle...

42:17.118 --> 42:18.745
I think they are eating.

42:19.871 --> 42:20.997
Mom!

42:21.998 --> 42:22.999
Mom?

42:23.082 --> 42:24.459
Hello, Mom?

42:24.542 --> 42:25.589
I'm here.

42:27.128 --> 42:28.129
Hello?

42:30.631 --> 42:32.099
Are you there?

42:32.300 --> 42:35.224
Try and talk to her,
the connection is bad.

42:35.803 --> 42:37.225
- Hello?
- Paula.

42:37.388 --> 42:38.435
Mrs. Clark, uh...

42:38.514 --> 42:40.312
If you can hear us we're...

42:40.391 --> 42:41.438
Hello, Mrs. Clark?

42:41.726 --> 42:44.104
This is my grandmother's journal
from when she was in Brazil.

42:44.562 --> 42:45.563
Hello?

42:45.813 --> 42:47.486
Hello, Mrs. Clark?

42:51.652 --> 42:53.700
This is symbol of my tribe.

42:58.117 --> 43:00.165
Mother says come with us to village.

43:00.244 --> 43:01.917
- Hello?
- Be dark soon.

43:01.996 --> 43:03.088
Not safe here.

43:03.164 --> 43:04.165
Hello?

43:04.248 --> 43:06.091
Ask my mom if I can sleep
at your apartment tonight.

43:06.167 --> 43:09.842
Lea, we have to go back to Manaus
before your mother kills us.

43:10.004 --> 43:12.723
That is if hers doesn't do it first.

43:12.799 --> 43:15.302
Rain forest is no place for you at night.

43:17.303 --> 43:18.896
Mother says come.

43:18.971 --> 43:20.348
Mrs. Clark?

43:21.015 --> 43:22.688
Hello, hi.

43:23.392 --> 43:25.440
Could Lea sleep over tonight?

43:26.604 --> 43:28.447
Did you say, sleep over?

43:28.523 --> 43:31.197
Sure, yes, thank you.

43:31.359 --> 43:32.360
Hello?

43:32.693 --> 43:33.990
Thank goodness for Paula.

43:34.070 --> 43:35.196
So they're okay?

43:35.279 --> 43:37.202
Yeah, I think they're really bonding.

43:37.281 --> 43:39.204
Your mother will not be happy with me.

43:39.283 --> 43:41.832
She will be when we find my brother.

45:22.470 --> 45:23.972
Show him book.

45:26.641 --> 45:28.643
- Lea.
- I'm fine.

45:34.941 --> 45:36.784
This is my grandmother.

45:36.859 --> 45:38.611
Her name was Amanda.

45:50.998 --> 45:51.999
Amanda.

46:10.017 --> 46:11.189
Amanda.

46:19.360 --> 46:21.909
Grandmother help when tribe was sick.

46:23.739 --> 46:25.082
Ama was here?

46:29.537 --> 46:32.632
Ama was here long time ago.

46:41.924 --> 46:44.018
Do you realize what this means?

46:44.093 --> 46:45.515
Ama's stories were true.

46:46.470 --> 46:47.892
Unbelievable.

46:50.641 --> 46:52.689
Please, can you help us?

46:52.768 --> 46:53.985
My brother is missing.

47:00.735 --> 47:02.658
We help find Ama's grandson.

47:03.446 --> 47:05.699
Ama was friend to us.

47:10.202 --> 47:13.331
He says, spirits of
the forest send you here.

47:13.581 --> 47:14.878
They help find.

47:14.957 --> 47:18.211
We send best men out to help find brother.

47:18.294 --> 47:19.591
Thank you.

48:18.145 --> 48:20.147
We should be out there looking for him.

48:20.231 --> 48:21.278
I know.

48:21.357 --> 48:24.827
But the tribespeople will have
more luck than we would.

48:50.136 --> 48:51.729
Surprise!

48:53.013 --> 48:54.060
Um...

48:54.140 --> 48:55.357
There's a...

48:55.474 --> 48:56.646
Gongo.

48:57.143 --> 48:58.110
Gongo?

48:58.185 --> 48:59.482
Surprise.

48:59.979 --> 49:01.447
You want me to eat it?

49:01.564 --> 49:03.862
No, no, no.

49:04.191 --> 49:05.283
We cook it first.

49:08.362 --> 49:09.363
Now you.

49:18.581 --> 49:19.958
What about the bow and arrow?

49:20.040 --> 49:21.508
Maybe archery will be more my thing.

49:23.252 --> 49:26.555
First, see yourself climb.

49:26.881 --> 49:27.882
Oh.

49:29.550 --> 49:30.722
Visualize.

49:35.222 --> 49:36.269
Yes!

49:39.518 --> 49:40.610
Good.

49:44.523 --> 49:46.070
I got it.

49:51.238 --> 49:52.956
- High-five.
- High-five.

50:03.876 --> 50:05.719
- Gongo.
- Gongo.

50:35.324 --> 50:37.201
At least it's organic.

51:20.578 --> 51:22.046
Did they find him?

51:22.121 --> 51:24.419
They heard truck. We leave in morning.

51:24.748 --> 51:26.625
The truck's gonna be long gone by morning.

51:26.834 --> 51:29.462
They leave best men up in forest.

51:29.545 --> 51:31.889
They follow sounds tonight.

51:44.727 --> 51:46.525
They are spirits of the forest.

51:46.812 --> 51:48.655
They help find brother.

51:50.107 --> 51:51.108
Lea,

51:52.109 --> 51:54.362
we'll find him, really.

51:54.695 --> 51:55.696
It's okay.

51:55.779 --> 51:58.783
I'm just so worried about him.

52:02.202 --> 52:04.204
I know, he's okay.

52:04.663 --> 52:05.664
Okay?

52:05.748 --> 52:10.629
Nothing we can do tonight,
except enjoy our time here.

52:11.712 --> 52:12.713
Hmm?

52:15.924 --> 52:17.050
Okay.

52:28.228 --> 52:29.229
Come.

52:33.567 --> 52:35.114
Come, let's go.

52:38.864 --> 52:39.865
Hey!

53:52.479 --> 53:53.731
- You sure?
- Sí.

53:54.481 --> 53:56.279
Thank you very much.

54:01.155 --> 54:02.156
No.

54:06.577 --> 54:08.079
- No.
- No?

54:08.746 --> 54:10.089
Thank you.

54:14.877 --> 54:16.925
Excuse me? Excuse me?

54:17.838 --> 54:19.306
Yeah, I know this guy.

54:19.381 --> 54:20.382
Birdy!

54:20.716 --> 54:21.717
Birdy?

54:22.092 --> 54:26.062
Uh, he wears a bonnet with red bird.

54:27.181 --> 54:29.104
Yes! Yes! That's the Cardinals.

54:29.183 --> 54:30.435
That's our baseball team.

54:30.517 --> 54:32.235
Yes! Yes! So listen.

54:32.352 --> 54:35.151
So he's been missing since Tuesday night.

54:38.317 --> 54:40.695
- Well, he wasn't here Tuesday.
- How do you know?

54:40.778 --> 54:42.997
The nights must blur together.

54:43.197 --> 54:46.542
We were closed, a private party.

54:47.493 --> 54:48.870
Very small.

56:00.941 --> 56:02.443
Where you live?

56:03.402 --> 56:04.745
St. Louis.

56:05.028 --> 56:07.122
It's really far from here.

56:07.823 --> 56:10.326
But there's not a lot of adventure.

56:11.076 --> 56:12.248
You like adventure?

56:12.411 --> 56:14.459
I get that from my Ama.

56:14.913 --> 56:16.665
My father have adventure.

56:17.040 --> 56:18.292
He go to city.

56:18.458 --> 56:21.462
Tell bad guys,
leave forest and tribe alone.

56:21.753 --> 56:23.551
My father very brave,

56:25.757 --> 56:28.055
but bad men take him.

56:29.803 --> 56:30.975
You must miss him.

56:31.471 --> 56:34.099
His spirit with me, always.

56:35.475 --> 56:38.854
When you leave place,
you leave piece of self behind.

56:38.937 --> 56:40.655
That's what my Ama always said.

56:57.915 --> 56:59.087
Paula.

57:00.167 --> 57:01.168
Yes.

57:01.335 --> 57:02.757
Did you hear that?

57:05.005 --> 57:07.428
- Pretty sure it was a bird.
- Okay.

57:11.219 --> 57:14.314
What if Zac is already...

57:14.640 --> 57:15.857
Don't say it.

57:16.850 --> 57:17.817
He's fine.

57:17.893 --> 57:20.567
But what if we never get to see him again?

57:20.812 --> 57:22.155
We will.

57:25.484 --> 57:26.485
You were right.

57:26.568 --> 57:28.741
We should've never come
into the rainforest alone.

57:28.862 --> 57:32.366
Hey, we're not alone.

57:32.532 --> 57:35.251
We have Aki, our own personal guide.

57:35.702 --> 57:39.002
I guarantee she knows
the Amazon better than anyone.

57:39.414 --> 57:41.257
Better than those men.

57:42.876 --> 57:44.128
I just wanted to help.

57:44.211 --> 57:45.463
I know.

57:45.796 --> 57:49.721
When we got to the river,
I was ready to go back.

57:50.342 --> 57:52.561
It took guts to keep going.

57:53.929 --> 57:55.055
He's my brother.

57:55.430 --> 57:57.228
He's lucky to have you.

57:58.725 --> 58:00.727
- You're not so bad either.
- Oh.

58:01.561 --> 58:03.313
Gee!

58:03.605 --> 58:04.606
Thanks.

58:07.442 --> 58:08.944
Hey, Paula?

58:09.403 --> 58:12.703
Did you see that thing
scurry across the ceiling?

58:15.701 --> 58:16.953
Wanna share a hammock?

58:17.035 --> 58:18.127
Yeah.

58:40.767 --> 58:42.269
Sun up! Sun up!

58:48.608 --> 58:49.825
Five more minutes.

58:49.901 --> 58:51.448
Hurry. We go.

58:52.988 --> 58:54.080
Zac!

58:55.282 --> 58:56.875
Any sign of the truck?

58:56.950 --> 58:58.042
Did they find him?

58:58.118 --> 58:59.586
We head east.

59:00.829 --> 59:01.955
Thank you.

59:05.333 --> 59:06.755
Who's that?

59:06.960 --> 59:08.382
Babysitter.

59:14.551 --> 59:15.928
I don't know what else to do.

59:16.011 --> 59:17.513
Still no word from Lea.

59:17.596 --> 59:19.815
Paula's phone keeps going to voicemail.

59:19.931 --> 59:21.774
You want me to have someone
check her apartment?

59:21.850 --> 59:23.193
Yes, thank you.

59:23.310 --> 59:24.653
Oh, I got this.

59:37.824 --> 59:40.293
I stole it from Zac's office.

59:42.829 --> 59:43.955
What is it?

59:44.164 --> 59:46.007
This expression he wrote.

59:50.003 --> 59:51.050
What does it mean?

59:51.171 --> 59:53.640
"What one finds is not stolen.

59:53.715 --> 59:55.388
"Whoever lost was careless."

59:56.510 --> 59:57.477
Finders keepers.

59:57.552 --> 59:58.553
Exactly.

59:59.721 --> 01:00:00.973
This is a receipt.

01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:03.233
From five days ago.

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:07.858
Let's go.

01:00:20.992 --> 01:00:22.209
No move.

01:00:55.193 --> 01:00:56.285
Hey.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:57.742
Excuse me?

01:00:57.904 --> 01:00:58.951
Um...

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:01.158
I was on a jeep tour with my parents,

01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:04.582
and I got mad and stormed off.

01:01:05.287 --> 01:01:06.834
And now I'm lost.

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:10.083
Can I use your phone?

01:01:11.626 --> 01:01:13.845
Do you speak English?

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.423
Lea, run! Lea! Lea, run!

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:24.310
Take that!

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:25.773
You little...

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:28.022
Where's my brother?

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:32.697
I said, where is my brother?

01:01:32.772 --> 01:01:33.819
I don't know.

01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:41.073
Where is my brother?

01:01:46.203 --> 01:01:49.873
They've taken him away to the city
and sent him off with all the other animals.

01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:52.425
I've no idea where they'll end up.

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:06.056
Hold on.

01:02:08.308 --> 01:02:09.685
Just a second.

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:10.810
Hello.

01:02:11.645 --> 01:02:13.238
Lea, where have you been?

01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:15.281
Mom, I was right.

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:17.609
Zac, he's tracking the poachers.

01:02:17.692 --> 01:02:19.365
What are you talking about?

01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:20.991
He's in Manaus.

01:02:21.279 --> 01:02:22.622
He's here?

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:23.740
Where?

01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:25.166
I'm not exactly sure about that.

01:02:25.283 --> 01:02:27.081
- But I'm...
- Okay, listen to me.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.130
Lea Clark, listen to me very carefully.

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:34.171
I have barely slept in the last 48 hours.

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:38.472
I need you both to get to Zac's
apartment immediately.

01:02:38.546 --> 01:02:41.470
The last thing I need
is to worry about you, too, okay?

01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:42.641
Mom, we're safe.

01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:46.266
No, no, you go to his apartment,
you call me when you get there,

01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:48.314
- and you stay put.
- Fine.

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:50.767
But it might take us a while 'cause...

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:52.102
No, no!

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:55.530
You go there and you stay there.

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:58.153
And when I call, you pick up the phone.

01:02:58.233 --> 01:02:59.780
You understand?

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:03.406
Mom, we're in the Amazon.

01:03:04.406 --> 01:03:05.498
Mom?

01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:07.033
Mom?

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:12.918
She hung up.

01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:17.836
- They're okay?
- Yeah.

01:03:17.919 --> 01:03:19.387
Whoever said having kids was easy?

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:21.135
Absolutely no one.

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:26.887
What's the sign say?

01:03:28.096 --> 01:03:30.349
It's the edge
of the protected tribal area.

01:03:30.432 --> 01:03:31.524
What does that mean?

01:03:31.599 --> 01:03:32.600
It's okay.

01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:33.727
I go with you.

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:35.107
Are you allowed to go past that sign?

01:03:35.353 --> 01:03:36.525
It's not safe.

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:38.068
I go to city.

01:03:39.524 --> 01:03:41.071
Uh-uh! No way.

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:43.324
You said your tribe
has to stay invisible to survive.

01:03:43.403 --> 01:03:45.280
You could be exposed to disease or...

01:03:45.363 --> 01:03:47.161
You're like my mother.

01:03:47.741 --> 01:03:50.995
I'm sorry, Aki,
but I can't let you come with us.

01:03:53.204 --> 01:03:54.330
I can't, either.

01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:56.837
I could never forgive myself
if something happened to you.

01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:06.092
Handsome boy.

01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:07.518
He shopped here.

01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:09.183
We have many customers.

01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:12.732
Well, we're asking everyone
to keep eyes and ears open.

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:19.731
Well, anything I can do to help.

01:04:20.273 --> 01:04:21.365
Do you have a restroom?

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:23.489
Sure, it's down there.

01:04:23.568 --> 01:04:24.911
Thank you.

01:04:42.796 --> 01:04:44.048
We're here.

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:46.807
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

01:04:47.175 --> 01:04:48.518
My name is Lea.

01:04:48.676 --> 01:04:50.303
My name Aki.

01:04:50.804 --> 01:04:51.976
Friends forever.

01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:09.743
So this is it.

01:05:10.115 --> 01:05:12.743
Your spirit will be always with me.

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:15.999
And yours

01:05:16.996 --> 01:05:19.090
with me.

01:05:34.389 --> 01:05:37.017
There's no way I'm getting
this through airport security.

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:40.899
Thank you, Aki,

01:05:43.189 --> 01:05:44.736
for everything.

01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:52.532
Lea!

01:05:53.908 --> 01:05:54.909
Knock, knock.

01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:56.369
Who's there?

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:57.787
Boo!

01:05:58.246 --> 01:05:59.372
Boo who?

01:05:59.539 --> 01:06:01.257
Boo hoo, don't cry.

01:06:01.916 --> 01:06:03.418
It's all okay.

01:06:14.888 --> 01:06:16.390
Go find your brother.

01:06:26.065 --> 01:06:27.066
Hey!

01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:40.292
Go.

01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:44.880
We need to get back to Manaus.

01:06:44.959 --> 01:06:46.802
Could I get you to
charge my phone, please?

01:06:46.878 --> 01:06:48.004
Okay.

01:07:13.613 --> 01:07:14.785
He's hiding something.

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:15.865
Agreed.

01:07:15.949 --> 01:07:17.667
But I can't go in without permission.

01:07:17.742 --> 01:07:18.994
No.

01:07:19.494 --> 01:07:20.495
But I can.

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:22.963
Okay.

01:07:48.606 --> 01:07:49.607
Hi, again.

01:07:50.984 --> 01:07:52.986
I'd like to see what's behind that door.

01:07:53.611 --> 01:07:55.830
It's just storage.

01:07:55.947 --> 01:07:57.915
So, you don't mind my taking a look?

01:07:58.575 --> 01:07:59.827
Excuse me?

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:12.972
There you are, Gatinha.

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:21.020
I'm sorry.

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:28.604
That's coming from my son's office.

01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:03.555
The truck!

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:18.366
He followed us.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.252
Go, go, go!

01:10:07.912 --> 01:10:08.913
Ah!

01:10:08.996 --> 01:10:12.125
We've gotta find out who was
on the other end of that phone call.

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:21.574
Lea. Lea, let's go. We need to follow him.

01:11:22.153 --> 01:11:24.155
He's our only way to Zac.

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:47.888
Come on.

01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:53.476
Get down, get down.

01:12:05.404 --> 01:12:06.405
Okay?

01:12:07.907 --> 01:12:09.079
Hey, hey!

01:12:09.242 --> 01:12:11.745
I'm in charge of
bringing you back in one piece.

01:12:15.456 --> 01:12:18.005
Take the sidewalk, you'll find him.

01:12:46.237 --> 01:12:50.954
Okay, somebody in this office
had better start talking.

01:12:55.997 --> 01:12:57.089
Luis?

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:02.970
Where's my son?

01:14:08.986 --> 01:14:10.363
I can do it.

01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:11.864
What?

01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:13.157
No!

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:14.241
Uh-uh!

01:14:14.367 --> 01:14:15.869
I don't think so. No way.

01:14:15.993 --> 01:14:17.210
Climbing is climbing.

01:14:17.745 --> 01:14:20.043
If you fall from that height...

01:14:20.706 --> 01:14:23.425
I'm gonna try really hard not to fall.

01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:26.880
Lea, listen to me, okay?

01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:28.305
I really don't think this is a good...

01:14:28.381 --> 01:14:31.843
I know, but I can do it.

01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:41.727
Okay.

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:45.610
You go slow, okay?

01:14:45.773 --> 01:14:47.867
You remember what Aki taught you.

01:14:57.660 --> 01:14:59.003
Visualize.

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:17.771
Just keeping you on your toes.

01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:20.149
Okay, please be careful, Lea.

01:16:45.851 --> 01:16:46.852
Mmm-hmm.

01:17:35.359 --> 01:17:36.986
Hello? Is someone here?

01:17:37.069 --> 01:17:38.161
- Zac!
- Lea.

01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:39.204
Zac!

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.702
- I'm over here, come...
- Zac!

01:17:40.781 --> 01:17:41.782
I'm over here.

01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:44.451
I'm over here!

01:17:44.535 --> 01:17:45.752
- We're coming!
- Paula!

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:47.375
- Zac!
- What are you doing here?

01:17:47.454 --> 01:17:48.831
- How did you find me?
- We've gotta go.

01:17:48.914 --> 01:17:50.507
You've gotta go. These guys are dangerous.

01:17:50.583 --> 01:17:51.755
This is no joke.

01:17:52.126 --> 01:17:53.628
We're not leaving without you.

01:17:53.711 --> 01:17:55.304
No, this isn't a joke.

01:17:58.716 --> 01:17:59.888
Come on.

01:18:24.575 --> 01:18:25.827
Come on.

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:33.633
Your bag...

01:18:33.751 --> 01:18:35.128
What are you...

01:18:42.343 --> 01:18:45.347
Anything you know.
Names, places, routes they take.

01:18:45.429 --> 01:18:46.601
They never told me anything.

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:47.932
They paid me a lot of money
for some information.

01:18:48.015 --> 01:18:49.688
You helped kidnap my son.

01:18:49.767 --> 01:18:51.565
They just wanted the animals.

01:18:51.644 --> 01:18:53.396
I needed the money.

01:19:02.029 --> 01:19:03.030
What?

01:19:03.113 --> 01:19:05.491
There's no one at Zac's
or Paula's apartment.

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:07.993
Mom is so worried.

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:09.329
Everyone is worried out of their minds.

01:19:09.411 --> 01:19:11.505
I'm sorry, but this is way too dangerous.

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.127
You told me it wasn't dangerous.

01:19:13.207 --> 01:19:14.754
And you told me you'd keep it a secret.

01:19:14.833 --> 01:19:16.506
That's not fair.

01:19:17.044 --> 01:19:19.763
You were in trouble,
and I had to tell someone.

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:27.346
I'm not mad at you.

01:19:28.472 --> 01:19:29.564
I can't believe this.

01:19:30.307 --> 01:19:32.901
All of that hard work, to get this close,

01:19:32.977 --> 01:19:35.196
and now the second they leave,
they'll vanish,

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:38.737
along with all the animals
and all this would've been for nothing.

01:19:40.693 --> 01:19:42.616
What's gonna happen to them?

01:19:42.695 --> 01:19:43.821
All of the animals?

01:19:44.029 --> 01:19:46.578
They'll sell them to the highest bidder.

01:19:46.657 --> 01:19:47.909
Stop, you can't!

01:19:47.992 --> 01:19:49.164
Lea, please, calm down.

01:19:49.243 --> 01:19:50.961
Don't bring attention.

01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:09.054
You promised.

01:20:09.138 --> 01:20:11.641
The police have been trying
to find these guys for years.

01:20:11.765 --> 01:20:13.358
I couldn't just sit back with what I knew

01:20:13.434 --> 01:20:16.984
and watched them destroy
everything we're trying to fix.

01:20:18.063 --> 01:20:19.280
I know.

01:20:21.233 --> 01:20:22.735
Lea, what are you doing?

01:20:23.068 --> 01:20:24.445
Lea, please, stop.

01:20:24.528 --> 01:20:26.701
- Seriously, let me and Paula take care of this.
- Why?

01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:27.997
Because you're 10 years old.

01:20:28.073 --> 01:20:30.246
You're my little sister
and it's my job to protect you.

01:20:30.326 --> 01:20:32.829
It's our job to protect each other!

01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:34.751
Team Zea, right?

01:20:34.997 --> 01:20:36.169
- Paula?
- Aye...

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:38.967
You really think you could
talk her out of it, anyway?

01:20:39.043 --> 01:20:40.920
You two have the same genes.

01:20:46.967 --> 01:20:48.435
- Did they trace Paula's cell phone?
- Yes.

01:20:48.594 --> 01:20:50.596
- It's somewhere in the warehouse district.
- Oh.

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:54.149
Let's just hope she and Lea
and the phone are together.

01:21:02.983 --> 01:21:04.985
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.
We've gotta use the bathroom.

01:21:07.988 --> 01:21:09.205
Please.

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:21.961
Come on, Lea, Zac, come on.

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:27.967
We need to get help.

01:21:29.468 --> 01:21:30.560
Now!

01:21:43.148 --> 01:21:44.149
Stop!

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:47.319
It's them, it's them!

01:21:54.493 --> 01:21:55.460
Mom!

01:21:55.536 --> 01:21:56.537
Are you okay?

01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:57.621
We're fine.

01:21:58.705 --> 01:21:59.922
I'm fine. We're all fine.

01:21:59.998 --> 01:22:01.045
I told you to stay put!

01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:02.126
I know, but...

01:22:02.209 --> 01:22:03.586
- Mrs. Clark, it's my fault.
- We found him!

01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:04.795
I don't even know what to say.

01:22:04.878 --> 01:22:06.255
Mom, we gotta go get 'em!

01:22:06.338 --> 01:22:07.385
The poachers.

01:22:07.464 --> 01:22:09.933
They got a truck full of animals
and they're gonna disappear!

01:22:10.008 --> 01:22:11.180
Do you know where they're headed?

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:12.728
Their warehouse is just over there.

01:22:12.803 --> 01:22:15.556
No, no, no, I'm not leaving you
out of my sight.

01:22:15.639 --> 01:22:16.936
- We've got no time...
- Mom!

01:22:17.015 --> 01:22:18.187
Mom, we don't have time...

01:22:18.267 --> 01:22:19.393
Maybe we all go.

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:20.602
Come, let's go.

01:22:36.535 --> 01:22:37.707
We're too late.

01:22:37.953 --> 01:22:39.626
Well, they can't be that far.

01:22:39.705 --> 01:22:41.002
Yes, they can.

01:22:41.206 --> 01:22:44.589
I was kidding myself to think that
I'd be the one to finally catch them.

01:22:44.668 --> 01:22:45.669
Listen,

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:50.758
the most important thing is that
you're here and you're safe, okay?

01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:56.896
Zac.

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:01.777
I've got you.

01:23:02.603 --> 01:23:04.025
Don't worry.

01:23:04.563 --> 01:23:05.815
It's gonna be okay.

01:23:06.398 --> 01:23:08.400
It's okay, I've got you.

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:15.912
Yeah, I've got you.

01:23:18.994 --> 01:23:20.667
I promise. It's all right.

01:23:22.539 --> 01:23:24.667
Everything is gonna be okay.

01:23:26.251 --> 01:23:27.594
Is he okay?

01:23:29.546 --> 01:23:31.548
His gums are pretty pale.

01:23:32.591 --> 01:23:34.093
He's in pretty bad shape.

01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:36.178
You'll be okay, Bailey.

01:23:39.306 --> 01:23:41.274
I'll take him to the sanctuary.

01:23:41.767 --> 01:23:43.189
You find those poachers.

01:23:43.727 --> 01:23:45.525
I'll get you a ride.

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:49.616
Well, we can't just let them get away.

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:51.284
It's over, Cricket.

01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:54.242
Well, after everything we've been through,

01:23:54.321 --> 01:23:57.325
we can't, we can't just give up now!

01:23:58.909 --> 01:24:01.753
Guys, your dad's plane's
gonna be landing soon

01:24:01.828 --> 01:24:04.001
and we've gotta be at
the apartment to let him in.

01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:17.011
Is it still working?

01:24:17.302 --> 01:24:20.476
The screen is cracked,
everything else seems okay.

01:24:29.523 --> 01:24:30.570
What about boats?

01:24:30.649 --> 01:24:31.650
Boats?

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:34.907
There's a photo here
of the shop owner on a boat.

01:24:36.154 --> 01:24:38.532
The poachers use boats sometimes.

01:24:44.329 --> 01:24:45.831
Can you see the name on the boat?

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:48.167
Achados.

01:24:48.792 --> 01:24:50.339
Achados something...

01:24:50.419 --> 01:24:52.513
Achados E Perdidos?

01:24:54.172 --> 01:24:55.173
Yeah.

01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:56.759
Yeah, that's it!

01:25:02.764 --> 01:25:03.981
Finders keepers.

01:25:04.349 --> 01:25:05.441
Yes.

01:25:15.861 --> 01:25:18.239
It will have to be bigger than these.

01:25:18.572 --> 01:25:21.701
Big enough to take at least
two truckloads of crates.

01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:38.888
Achados E Perdidos.

01:25:39.384 --> 01:25:41.227
- Which one?
- That one.

01:26:45.367 --> 01:26:47.119
The shop owner. He's getting away!

01:26:50.789 --> 01:26:51.881
No, Zac!

01:26:51.957 --> 01:26:53.129
It's okay.

01:27:30.412 --> 01:27:31.459
We got him.

01:27:39.379 --> 01:27:42.178
Score one for the Brazilian
Police Department.

01:27:43.592 --> 01:27:45.515
You are the real heroes.

01:27:45.594 --> 01:27:47.847
It was definitely a team effort.

01:27:50.307 --> 01:27:51.604
I can't thank you enough.

01:27:52.017 --> 01:27:53.985
The power of motherhood.

01:27:57.397 --> 01:27:59.525
Hey, thanks for saving me.

01:28:00.275 --> 01:28:01.492
Anytime.

01:28:05.947 --> 01:28:07.870
- Let's go home.
- Yeah.

01:28:21.254 --> 01:28:22.255
Anybody home?

01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:23.381
Dad.

01:28:23.757 --> 01:28:24.974
Hey!

01:28:25.634 --> 01:28:27.511
Popcorn. Ooh!

01:28:28.011 --> 01:28:29.388
Let me look at you.

01:28:29.471 --> 01:28:30.893
- You okay?
- I'm good.

01:28:31.056 --> 01:28:32.399
Good, good.

01:28:32.516 --> 01:28:35.645
Wow. I thought you'd all be
in bed asleep by now.

01:28:35.727 --> 01:28:37.149
Paula's just told me.

01:28:37.229 --> 01:28:38.776
You can't even imagine.

01:28:38.855 --> 01:28:41.904
But let's sit down and, uh,
grab something to eat.

01:28:42.067 --> 01:28:43.865
Lea has something to say.

01:28:44.069 --> 01:28:46.037
Ama's stories were true.

01:28:46.404 --> 01:28:47.405
We met them.

01:28:47.489 --> 01:28:48.581
The tribe Ama wrote about.

01:28:48.657 --> 01:28:49.749
What?

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:52.328
Paula and I followed a lead
from Zac's notebook.

01:28:52.410 --> 01:28:54.504
We met a girl, Aki.

01:28:54.579 --> 01:28:58.083
She found us in the rainforest
and took us to her village.

01:28:58.166 --> 01:29:00.134
We spent the night
with them in their huts.

01:29:00.210 --> 01:29:02.713
And there were bugs the size of my fist.

01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:06.262
You slept in the rainforest?

01:29:07.425 --> 01:29:10.099
The tribal elder,
he had one of Ama's journals.

01:29:10.178 --> 01:29:12.146
- No way.
- He sure did.

01:29:12.639 --> 01:29:16.360
But if... If Ama's stories were true,
why did she say they weren't?

01:29:16.434 --> 01:29:17.606
To protect the tribe.

01:29:17.769 --> 01:29:19.487
Ama was a hero.

01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:21.607
Even more than we thought.

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:23.363
You slept in the rainforest?

01:29:23.859 --> 01:29:24.951
Yeah.

01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:29.531
Uh...

01:29:31.116 --> 01:29:34.336
I need to be able to trust
that when I ask you

01:29:34.411 --> 01:29:38.256
to do something or not do something,
you'll listen.

01:29:38.331 --> 01:29:39.332
I know.

01:29:39.624 --> 01:29:42.719
And I'm gonna do a better job
of listening to you, too.

01:29:42.794 --> 01:29:44.296
- Deal?
- Deal.

01:29:45.005 --> 01:29:46.757
I love you so much.

01:29:47.465 --> 01:29:49.433
Oh. You're my girl.

01:29:50.802 --> 01:29:53.897
Oh, Paula, Carol and I,
we'd like to thank you for...

01:29:53.972 --> 01:29:56.066
Please, stop right there.

01:29:56.182 --> 01:30:00.187
Zac would be halfway to
who-knows-where if it wasn't for Lea.

01:30:00.312 --> 01:30:01.985
She's an amazing girl.

01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:05.237
But it could have gone badly
at any stage, and it didn't.

01:30:05.358 --> 01:30:07.326
I think Ama was watching over us.

01:30:07.652 --> 01:30:11.786
So, I told Mom and Dad I'll be applying
to colleges in St. Louis in the fall.

01:30:11.948 --> 01:30:14.417
We could stay up late
and watch bad movies,

01:30:14.492 --> 01:30:15.994
and you could drive me
to school in the morning.

01:30:16.328 --> 01:30:17.500
Just like old times.

01:30:18.121 --> 01:30:20.123
That sounds great.

01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:21.837
But I don't think so.

01:30:22.792 --> 01:30:24.009
Come on.

01:30:26.129 --> 01:30:27.472
It's just

01:30:28.214 --> 01:30:29.761
you've got a life here.

01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:32.264
And I don't want to be the one
to keep you from living it.

01:30:34.095 --> 01:30:35.893
How old are you again?

01:30:37.515 --> 01:30:40.359
Plus, I think Paula's pretty much

01:30:40.435 --> 01:30:43.029
the coolest girl you're ever gonna get.

01:30:43.521 --> 01:30:46.024
Thanks, Cricket.

01:30:46.691 --> 01:30:47.943
You know,

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:50.783
I'm done with calling you Cricket.

01:30:51.488 --> 01:30:55.576
That name's for kids,
and you're all grown up now.

01:30:57.410 --> 01:30:58.707
Team Zea!

01:30:59.245 --> 01:31:01.293
Team Zea!

01:31:04.209 --> 01:31:05.335
Oh!

01:31:23.103 --> 01:31:24.901
Good luck with your exhibit, Lea.

01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:25.981
Love you.

01:31:26.064 --> 01:31:27.862
- Zac and Paula.
- Zac and Paula.

01:31:47.085 --> 01:31:49.258
Lillian and Maya-Charles.

01:31:49.587 --> 01:31:51.339
That looks delicious.

01:31:51.423 --> 01:31:52.925
Come over here.

01:31:53.258 --> 01:31:56.432
You can walk over here
and you can go over there.

01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:03.109
Lea, these pictures are amazing!

01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:04.276
Thank you.

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:05.774
You must have had some adventure.

01:32:05.854 --> 01:32:07.322
Just some birds and trees.

01:32:07.439 --> 01:32:08.782
This could be anywhere.

01:32:08.857 --> 01:32:10.404
And hardly an adventure.

01:32:10.483 --> 01:32:11.530
Yeah.

01:32:12.318 --> 01:32:13.570
I guess you're right.

01:32:13.653 --> 01:32:14.870
But it wasn't just anywhere.

01:32:15.155 --> 01:32:17.328
And the photos are a bonus.

01:32:17.449 --> 01:32:20.919
The memories and experience
are all that really matter.

01:32:23.538 --> 01:32:25.381
Perhaps she's right.

01:32:26.624 --> 01:32:27.625
Maybe.

01:32:28.293 --> 01:32:29.545
Hey, it's going great.

01:32:29.627 --> 01:32:30.970
- How do you feel?
- Good.

01:32:31.046 --> 01:32:32.423
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:32:42.015 --> 01:32:43.016
John.

01:32:43.099 --> 01:32:44.066
Kylie.

01:32:44.142 --> 01:32:45.359
I want you to meet my daughter, Lea.

01:32:45.435 --> 01:32:46.402
Our photographer.

01:32:46.478 --> 01:32:47.570
- Hi.
- Hi, Lea.

01:32:47.645 --> 01:32:49.113
Your pictures are amazing.

01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:50.441
Thank you.

01:32:50.607 --> 01:32:51.608
Lea, hi.

01:32:52.192 --> 01:32:54.365
I'm doing a piece for the Post Dispatch.

01:32:54.444 --> 01:32:57.448
Are there any stories you'd like
to tell to accompany these photos?

01:32:57.530 --> 01:33:00.875
Any encounters or surprises
in the rainforest?

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:03.957
Actually, yes.

01:33:04.829 --> 01:33:07.628
But I think I'll let the photos
speak for themselves.

01:33:07.874 --> 01:33:09.000
Okay.

01:33:38.571 --> 01:33:43.244
I thought my first trip to Brazil was
full of new experiences and new friends,

01:33:43.535 --> 01:33:46.129
but when I went back a second time,

01:33:46.538 --> 01:33:49.291
it was unlike any adventure
I'd ever imagined.
