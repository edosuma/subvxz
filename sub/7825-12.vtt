I am?

10:21.230 --> 10:22.860
You may not look

10:22.930 --> 10:25.930
like Ted Bessell
but you're just as nice.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.030
Ohhh.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.570
Dearly beloved.
We are gathered here
in the sight of God

10:30.640 --> 10:32.310
and this casino
to join...

10:32.380 --> 10:33.780
Homer.

10:33.850 --> 10:34.820
Marge.

10:34.880 --> 10:39.020
In holy matrimony. Beautiful.

10:39.080 --> 10:42.010
Do you, Marjorie Bouvier,
take Homer Simpson

10:42.090 --> 10:43.520
to be
your lawful wedded husband?

10:43.590 --> 10:44.630
I do.

10:44.690 --> 10:45.590
Homer, same question,
names reversed.

10:45.660 --> 10:47.230
I do.

10:47.290 --> 10:50.030
Then, by the power
vested in me by the
state gaming commission

10:50.100 --> 10:51.370
I pronounce you
man and wife.

11:26.870 --> 11:30.170
Hey, why don't I apply

11:30.240 --> 11:32.370
I hear they pay pretty well.

11:32.440 --> 11:35.510
I don't know.
I heard radiation
can make you sterile.

11:35.570 --> 11:36.970
Now you tell me.

11:40.350 --> 11:42.180
We only have
two openings

20:06.980 --> 20:08.780
Don't ever call me that.

20:08.850 --> 20:10.250
Marge! Marge,
where's the baby?

20:10.320 --> 20:11.560
Right where you
left it.

20:11.620 --> 20:12.250
Shut up.

20:12.320 --> 20:13.950
Hey listen, fat boy...

20:14.030 --> 20:15.100
No, <i>you listen.</i>

20:15.160 --> 20:17.100
This is my wife,
and this is my kid,

20:17.160 --> 20:19.000
and I'm paying for
this delivery.

20:19.060 --> 20:19.890
So if you wanna stay

20:19.960 --> 20:21.660
you better give me some respect.

20:21.730 --> 20:23.290
Homer, does this mean..?

20:23.370 --> 20:25.640
Starting tomorrow, I'm
a nuclear technician!

20:25.700 --> 20:27.660
Good God!

20:27.740 --> 20:30.510
And tomorrow morning,
I'm gonna buy your ring back,
then I'm going house hunting.

20:30.580 --> 20:32.810
Doesn't your job
start tomorrow?

20:32.880 --> 20:34.780
Somebody will
cover for me.

20:34.850 --> 20:36.320
Homer, that's... oh!

20:36.380 --> 20:37.320
Step aside.

20:37.380 --> 20:39.050
I'll deliver this baby.

20:39.120 --> 20:41.250
Why don't you
let <i>me handle it, Homer.</i>

20:41.320 --> 20:43.090
Oh, a college boy, eh?

20:43.150 --> 20:45.720
Homer, for God sakes,
let him deliver the baby!

20:45.790 --> 20:49.030
Homey, isn't
he beautiful?

20:49.090 --> 20:51.660
As long as he's got
eight fingers

20:51.730 --> 20:53.930
and eight toes,
he's fine by me.

20:54.000 --> 20:54.940
Oh, Bart!

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Daddy's little angel.

20:57.570 --> 20:58.310
Ah!

21:00.940 --> 21:02.210
Why, you little..!

21:02.270 --> 21:03.970
He did that on purpose!

21:04.040 --> 21:05.210
How could he?

21:05.280 --> 21:07.210
He's only
ten minutes old.

21:07.280 --> 21:09.120
( <i>baby cooing )</i>

21:09.180 --> 21:11.490
Bart, Lisa, come
here for a minute.

21:11.550 --> 21:14.420
You know, son,
the day you were born

21:14.490 --> 21:16.820
I received the greatest gift

21:16.890 --> 21:18.190
a man could have.

21:18.260 --> 21:19.930
As the years went by

21:19.990 --> 21:22.560
your mother and I
were blessed twice more

21:22.630 --> 21:26.270
and not a day goes by that
we don't thank God
for all three of you.

21:26.330 --> 21:27.270
Homer!

21:27.330 --> 21:28.940
I'm not pregnant!

21:29.000 --> 21:29.900
Yeah!

21:29.970 --> 21:30.940
Whoa!

21:31.000 --> 21:32.440
Excellent, Marge!

21:32.500 --> 21:34.230
Yes!
