00:46.440 --> 00:48.124
Let's begin.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.449
Very good.

01:07.640 --> 01:08.971
What was your wife's name?

01:10.480 --> 01:11.440
Mary.

01:11.520 --> 01:13.841
Mary. All right.

01:17.440 --> 01:20.125
He seeks the spirit of Mary Browning.

01:22.160 --> 01:25.323
Mary, we invite you into our circle.

01:30.360 --> 01:34.445
Mary Browning,
we invite you into our circle.

01:34.600 --> 01:36.284
We seek you in love and light.

01:36.440 --> 01:38.363
Dad, don't give this woman our money.

01:43.320 --> 01:44.526
Mary?

01:56.320 --> 01:59.722
Mary, if that's you, give us a sign.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.722
Blow out the candles.

02:10.720 --> 02:12.006
Welcome, Mary.

02:21.560 --> 02:23.244
We may ask three questions.

02:23.400 --> 02:24.970
Why just three?

02:26.360 --> 02:30.490
Mary, we ask that you let the candle
burn if the answer is yes.

02:30.640 --> 02:33.166
Blow it out if the answer is no.

02:36.560 --> 02:38.244
Ask your questions, sir.

02:42.520 --> 02:43.601
Mary,

02:46.080 --> 02:47.684
are you in pain

02:48.520 --> 02:49.760
anymore?

02:54.920 --> 02:56.081
She's not.

02:57.440 --> 03:00.284
The pain she felt before she passed,

03:00.400 --> 03:03.244
she's saying it was an illness?

03:03.560 --> 03:04.640
Cancer?

03:04.720 --> 03:05.767
Yeah.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.125
She is restored. She's...

03:09.280 --> 03:11.931
She's young again and beautiful.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.363
Beautiful forever, now.

03:17.600 --> 03:18.806
Mary, I...

03:20.040 --> 03:21.724
Can you forgive me?

03:22.080 --> 03:23.445
For all the things...

03:26.640 --> 03:27.801
She says yes.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.724
She forgives you.

03:29.880 --> 03:32.360
And she asks for your
forgiveness in return.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.891
Okay, I don't know how you're doing...

03:34.720 --> 03:36.324
Do not break the circle.

03:39.480 --> 03:42.290
Anyone can shake a table with their knee.

03:53.440 --> 03:55.522
She won't be here much longer.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.683
Ask your last question.

04:02.800 --> 04:06.169
Honey, I have to ask you about Jenny.

04:06.840 --> 04:10.848
She's seeing this young man, Don,
and they want a lot of money from me.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.047
Don't.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.241
I have to mortgage the house.

04:14.200 --> 04:17.204
It's supposed to be a terrific investment,

04:17.720 --> 04:20.610
and he says he'll marry her
if it turns out right...

04:31.800 --> 04:35.160
Okay, I don't know how she's
doing this, but this is a scam, Dad.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.005
I'm so sorry.

04:54.280 --> 04:56.203
The spirit world is unpredictable.

04:56.520 --> 04:58.682
She sounded angry. So angry.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.842
It's hard to explain.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.320
- Well, thank you for your time.
- No, no.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.401
No, I can't.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.644
Just remember what she came to say.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.451
She's at peace.

05:10.600 --> 05:11.681
And she loves you.

05:11.880 --> 05:14.280
And that's all to take away from today.

05:14.360 --> 05:16.203
The rest is the business of the living.

05:17.440 --> 05:20.569
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, thank you.

05:34.240 --> 05:38.450
What was that? You almost gave
that poor man a heart attack.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.680
Paulina Zander, get in here!

05:42.640 --> 05:45.564
She deserved it, Mom. She was just
trying to steal her dad's money.

05:45.720 --> 05:49.441
That isn't what we do here. It's our job
to comfort them, not judge them.

05:49.600 --> 05:53.241
It's your job to stand at the curtains
and not attack the clients.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.127
And you, young lady?

05:56.320 --> 05:58.561
I heard screaming and got scared.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.761
I didn't mean to knock things down.

06:04.840 --> 06:06.490
This is unacceptable.

06:06.640 --> 06:09.530
That lady was unacceptable.
She was a real bitch.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.962
Witch. I'm not sorry.

06:14.120 --> 06:16.122
It cost us five dollars.

06:16.880 --> 06:18.370
Let me see that.

06:18.560 --> 06:21.685
He had so much weight on the table,
it was hard for me to latch on.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.330
What's a scam?

06:24.720 --> 06:27.166
The lady said we were a scam.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.364
Doris, listen to me.

06:30.360 --> 06:31.486
A scam is a lie.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.447
We don't lie. We help people.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.365
We give them closure, we give them peace.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.810
We heal their hearts.

06:40.280 --> 06:43.689
And that's not something that can
happen without some showmanship.

06:44.200 --> 06:47.010
We tell them the truth,
we just need to help them believe it.

06:47.560 --> 06:48.561
Oh.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.400
Okay.

06:50.480 --> 06:52.847
Well, we're gonna need to spice
that showmanship up a little,

06:53.000 --> 06:54.525
because it's getting kind of stale.

06:54.720 --> 06:57.849
And if we aren't here to judge,
then why did you blow out the last candle?

07:00.840 --> 07:02.968
We're none of us perfect, Lina.

07:04.920 --> 07:07.360
She really was a bitch, wasn't she?

07:10.720 --> 07:12.520
You are Miss Lizzie Borden, I presume.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.120
I must say, you're not exactly
what I expected.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.690
I'm not Miss Lizzie.

07:17.080 --> 07:18.286
I'm Emma.

07:18.920 --> 07:20.285
Oh, the sister. Hmm.

07:21.520 --> 07:24.690
Well, let's see, it's been a year
since your mother and father...

07:24.880 --> 07:27.724
Mom, ten more minutes.

07:27.920 --> 07:30.571
Hmm, I'm sorry, sweetie.
It's a school night.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.250
My sister was acquitted.

07:33.440 --> 07:34.805
And we never talk about it.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.161
Well, of course you don't,
but the public's interested, you know.

07:37.320 --> 07:39.209
Now, I represent the Sacramento Record.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.964
- You're one of those reporters?
- That's right.

07:41.120 --> 07:45.687
I'm saying goodnight now because I'm tired
and I didn't have a very good day at school,

07:45.840 --> 07:48.320
because Teri's still picking on my skirt.

07:48.480 --> 07:51.484
So, please send us the money
to buy a new skirt.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.605
Oh, and Lina got in trouble again.

07:55.520 --> 07:56.965
I was good, though.

07:57.720 --> 08:00.485
I love you and I miss you every day.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.051
Goodnight, Daddy.

08:02.840 --> 08:04.001
Amen.

08:04.920 --> 08:07.400
Why don't you pray anymore, Mommy?

08:08.640 --> 08:10.210
Who says I don't pray?

08:10.360 --> 08:13.523
You used to pray
every night with Daddy and me.

08:13.720 --> 08:16.849
But since he's gone, you never do.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.051
You're still praying to Daddy?

08:20.240 --> 08:22.049
Remember what Father Tom says?

08:23.680 --> 08:25.330
We're supposed to pray to God.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.523
I'd rather talk to Daddy.

08:27.760 --> 08:29.960
But he never answers.

08:30.040 --> 08:35.523
The people we help, their mommies
and daddies in heaven talk to them.

08:35.720 --> 08:38.006
Why doesn't Daddy talk to us?

08:38.880 --> 08:42.929
Just becauseyou can't hear him
doesn't mean he isn't there.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.401
What is it?

08:53.800 --> 08:55.450
Just saying goodnight.

08:56.240 --> 08:57.446
Goodnight.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.446
Took you long enough.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.800
Hey, Zander!

09:34.880 --> 09:37.281
Lina-Lina-bo-bina. Pull up a coffee cup.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.410
It's a little late for caffeine.

09:39.560 --> 09:41.403
My mom left her keys out.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.045
Groovy. When's she gonna be back?

09:43.200 --> 09:44.201
From her bridge game?

09:44.360 --> 09:48.445
Usually after midnight,
smelling a lot like coffee, if you get me.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.204
You want some?

10:08.080 --> 10:09.080
I don't think so.

10:09.160 --> 10:11.367
I mean, why not?
We see the moon every day.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.320
Why can't one of us just go on it?

10:13.400 --> 10:15.641
There's so many things that prevent us.

10:15.800 --> 10:16.881
I'm with Betty on it.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.525
- Yeah?
- I don't see why not.

10:18.720 --> 10:21.451
Yeah, but just,
they put the big helmets on...

10:23.480 --> 10:24.811
- Yeah, exactly.
- Whatever.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.166
The whole thing is a myth.

10:26.320 --> 10:29.608
Well, no. There's no air
or atmosphere up there.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.728
My mom just got that.

10:31.960 --> 10:34.406
She and her bridge club friends
play it sometimes.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.164
Is that the one where you talk to ghosts?

10:37.280 --> 10:40.648
Uh, then, no, thanks.
I get enough of that at home.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.891
It's actually really scary.

10:47.640 --> 10:49.324
You guys wanna play?

10:51.440 --> 10:53.966
We could just make conversation.

10:54.560 --> 10:55.607
The rules.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.006
Never play alone.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.010
Never play in a graveyard.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.724
Always say goodbye.

11:04.920 --> 11:06.809
Circle once for each player.

11:08.480 --> 11:09.686
Come on.

11:14.440 --> 11:15.885
Come on.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.604
As friends we gather, hearts are true.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.441
Spirits near, we call to you.

11:28.240 --> 11:30.163
Is there a spirit here?

11:37.320 --> 11:38.401
Oh, my God.

11:38.560 --> 11:39.971
Relax, Betty.

11:40.440 --> 11:42.761
Are you in the room with us?

11:45.440 --> 11:46.680
Oh, my God.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.205
Ellie, are you doing that?

11:48.360 --> 11:49.566
No, I swear.

11:49.720 --> 11:51.324
Ask your questions.

11:52.600 --> 11:56.366
What's it like on the other side?

12:11.160 --> 12:12.160
Oh, my God.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.242
Okay, here's how it works.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.404
All right, we all have our hands
on it, so we can't tell who moves it.

12:18.120 --> 12:21.408
We react to the slightest pull
by helping it move subconsciously.

12:21.560 --> 12:22.561
- Okay.
- I mean,

12:22.760 --> 12:24.808
this game was designed
to make us scare ourselves.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.160
- Yeah.
- There's nothing

12:26.240 --> 12:27.446
on the other side, believe me.

12:27.640 --> 12:28.971
- Okay.
- You're no fun.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.930
Okay, well, if we're just talking
to ourselves, then...

12:32.080 --> 12:36.529
Spirit, will Lina come
to homecoming with me?

12:42.360 --> 12:43.850
- Stop it, Ellie.
- It's the spirit.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.525
Guys, this is really
starting to freak me out.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.125
There's no spirit, Betty.

12:47.280 --> 12:48.280
Okay.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.362
Spirit, prove to us that you're here.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.090
Give us a sign.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.808
Yeah, you're right.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.767
See? Yeah, there's no spirit.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.046
There's no spirit.

13:08.360 --> 13:10.727
Ellie!

13:31.960 --> 13:33.086
Mom, I'm sorry.

13:33.240 --> 13:34.287
Get in.

13:45.520 --> 13:46.806
Why do you do these things?

13:46.960 --> 13:48.246
If you're gonna ground me,
just do it already.

13:48.400 --> 13:49.731
'Cause that worked so well the last time.

13:49.880 --> 13:51.530
We were just playing a stupid game.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.330
I can smell your breath.

13:55.560 --> 13:58.211
I know how hard it's been for you
and I understand how you feel.

13:58.320 --> 14:00.288
But I need you to help me, Lina.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.165
For all of us.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.285
I'm asking, honey.

14:06.240 --> 14:07.526
I'll try.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.084
Really? A Ouija board?

14:12.240 --> 14:13.571
It's actually pretty fun.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.927
You should consider adding one to the act.

14:19.480 --> 14:21.403
...soil is brought back to the Earth,

14:21.560 --> 14:24.291
eight guest scientists will join 14 others

14:24.440 --> 14:27.125
at the Ames Research Center
near San Francisco

14:27.280 --> 14:29.044
to analyze it for evidence of life...

14:29.200 --> 14:30.480
Honey, please sit with us.

14:30.560 --> 14:32.840
Just once I want to have
a normal family breakfast.

14:32.920 --> 14:35.720
Um, actually, I'm gonna be late
this morning, so I'm gonna walk.

14:35.800 --> 14:38.167
Don't be silly, have some food.
I'll drop you off.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.322
No, it's cool. I'm walking with a friend.

14:40.520 --> 14:41.521
Who?

14:41.920 --> 14:43.445
Just a friend. So...

14:43.600 --> 14:44.960
I gotta go.

14:46.520 --> 14:47.965
I'll get it!

14:48.360 --> 14:50.044
No, Doris, it's okay. I got it.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.571
See who it is first!

14:51.720 --> 14:53.404
It's some boy.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.286
Really?

14:57.200 --> 14:59.761
- Hi, young lady. Is Lina home?
- Yeah, she's right here.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.000
Hey, do you wanna go?

15:01.080 --> 15:03.447
Hi. Who are you?

15:03.560 --> 15:04.971
He's just a friend.

15:05.320 --> 15:07.368
Hi, Mrs. Zander. I'm Mikey.

15:13.760 --> 15:14.921
Are you ready to go?

15:15.080 --> 15:18.404
Not quite. If you guys are walking to school,
why don't you take your sister with you?

15:18.600 --> 15:20.284
I could use the morning
to run some errands.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.244
- But, Mom, I have class.
- Thanks, honey.

15:22.440 --> 15:23.521
I need my shoes.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.842
Go help your sister get ready.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.684
Come on, pipsqueak.

15:34.120 --> 15:35.360
Wow, this is...

15:35.800 --> 15:37.280
This is a beautiful home.

15:37.360 --> 15:38.361
Hmm.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.171
Is that where you do the seances?

15:42.280 --> 15:43.691
Readings.

15:44.400 --> 15:45.606
Come on in.

15:46.520 --> 15:48.522
Have you ever had your palm read?

15:48.680 --> 15:50.125
Can't say I have, Mrs. Zander.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.603
It's totally painless.

15:54.880 --> 15:57.850
Hmm. Southpaw. My husband was a lefty.

15:58.840 --> 16:03.687
This is your head line, this is
your life line, this is your heart line.

16:04.040 --> 16:06.407
You're wearing a senior jacket.
How old are you?

16:06.880 --> 16:08.245
I'm 17.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.522
Lina's a sophomore, you realize.

16:10.920 --> 16:12.365
Yes, ma'am.

16:14.800 --> 16:15.960
Oh...

16:16.040 --> 16:17.644
- What's wrong?
- Hmm.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.681
It's your life line.
You see how this curves here?

16:20.840 --> 16:23.240
This could mean a few things.
This is your dominant hand, right?

16:23.320 --> 16:24.321
Mmm-hmm.

16:25.120 --> 16:26.610
I'll tell you this for sure.

16:26.760 --> 16:30.560
If this hand, or any other hand,
for that matter,

16:30.760 --> 16:33.570
touches my daughter in
a way I don't like...

16:34.960 --> 16:38.160
I'd hate to see something
happen to your life line.

16:38.240 --> 16:39.241
You dig?

16:39.720 --> 16:40.721
Yes, ma'am.

16:44.480 --> 16:45.970
Off you go.

17:40.680 --> 17:43.763
You need to see the new Ramblers.

17:43.920 --> 17:47.641
The new Ramblers are in
at your local Rambler dealer.

17:48.120 --> 17:51.325
Dawson's Hardware, your friendly
neighborhood hardware supplier...

17:51.480 --> 17:52.845
Your mom's a witch.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.650
You are so weird.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.127
Are those cobwebs in your hair?

17:57.280 --> 17:59.123
Creepy little witch.

17:59.280 --> 18:01.521
Doris, the dorkus!

18:01.720 --> 18:03.165
Doris, the...

18:04.000 --> 18:05.047
That's enough.

18:05.760 --> 18:08.525
Now, go on.

18:12.680 --> 18:15.160
You know why people say
mean things, right?

18:15.360 --> 18:16.441
Why?

18:17.200 --> 18:18.850
Because they're scared.

18:19.960 --> 18:22.611
Makes me kind of feel sorry for them.
How about you?

18:23.920 --> 18:27.049
Yeah. I feel bad for them.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.683
All right, off you go.
I'll be right there.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.530
Thank you, Father.

18:37.200 --> 18:40.841
Does she have a lot of problems?
With other kids?

18:41.000 --> 18:44.846
She has her fair share,
but it's nothing too concerning.

18:45.640 --> 18:49.531
She's been slow making friends.
Since her dad...

18:50.280 --> 18:53.170
I know. I talk about that with her.

18:55.320 --> 18:57.163
That's very good of you.

18:57.480 --> 19:00.563
Well, she's a lovely girl.
It's really no trouble.

19:03.480 --> 19:05.528
Thank you, Father.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.482
Maybe you could invite
Father Tom over for a reading.

19:22.680 --> 19:26.207
I don't know if Father Tom
would want a reading, sweetheart.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.847
So he could talk to his wife.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.924
He's a priest.
They aren't allowed to have wives.

19:34.080 --> 19:35.445
He had one.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.602
Before he was a priest.

19:37.840 --> 19:39.285
She died.

19:39.920 --> 19:41.922
Just like Daddy.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.363
Hey, what's this?

20:03.560 --> 20:04.891
A new prop.

20:05.040 --> 20:06.530
For work.

20:46.320 --> 20:49.563
Is there a presence here with us?

20:58.640 --> 21:00.847
What is your name?

21:01.040 --> 21:02.485
Marcus.

21:05.440 --> 21:06.851
Yes.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.525
No.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.764
Who are you talking to, Doris?

21:14.960 --> 21:17.167
Spirit, can you hear me?

21:17.360 --> 21:19.044
Yes, we can.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.802
And we can see you.

21:23.520 --> 21:24.931
That'll work.

21:34.280 --> 21:35.770
What was that all about?

21:36.280 --> 21:37.770
What?

22:10.720 --> 22:11.926
Roger?

22:12.960 --> 22:15.042
Honey, are you there?

22:59.600 --> 23:01.011
I'm here.

23:12.520 --> 23:13.885
Are you there?

23:34.960 --> 23:36.405
Hi, friend.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.611
Now what?

24:09.840 --> 24:11.126
Who are you?

24:58.640 --> 25:00.404
Cut it out, Doris.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.811
Doris?

25:09.760 --> 25:11.125
Doris?

25:33.400 --> 25:37.246
This is a little awkward, but I had
to ask you because it just seemed...

25:37.400 --> 25:39.528
Well, so unusual.

25:40.760 --> 25:44.321
Have you been helping Doris
with her homework?

25:46.800 --> 25:48.404
Oh, God. Uh...

25:49.280 --> 25:52.045
Maybe not as much as I could. I'm sorry.

25:52.200 --> 25:55.090
Is she falling behind?
I can help her more.

25:55.320 --> 25:56.731
It's nothing like that.

25:57.840 --> 26:01.965
In fact, unless she's learned cursive,

26:02.160 --> 26:04.447
then somebody's been
helping her quite a bit.

26:06.280 --> 26:07.327
No.

26:09.640 --> 26:11.369
Doris, who helped you with this?

26:11.520 --> 26:13.409
My new friend.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.890
Who's your new friend?

26:20.200 --> 26:22.009
- I didn't do it.
- Well, I didn't.

26:22.160 --> 26:24.083
And Doris definitely didn't.

26:24.240 --> 26:27.130
Well, then, I don't know
what to tell you. It wasn't me.

26:27.280 --> 26:29.442
Did your sister do your homework for you?

26:29.600 --> 26:30.647
I told you.

26:30.800 --> 26:32.370
No.

26:33.360 --> 26:35.328
Your new friend did.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.488
I let her use my hand.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.450
Do you think we'll have to move?

27:05.320 --> 27:07.129
I don't know, sweetie.

27:11.160 --> 27:12.969
Dad won't like this.

27:15.320 --> 27:16.924
I should tell him.

27:38.200 --> 27:40.320
As friends we've gathered,
hearts are true.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.528
Spirits near, we call to you.

27:43.080 --> 27:44.525
Daddy...

27:46.200 --> 27:47.770
Did you hear that?

27:49.000 --> 27:52.447
We might have to move out of our house.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.009
I'm sorry, Mom.

28:08.160 --> 28:09.685
It's not right.

28:12.320 --> 28:14.891
This was your dad's house.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.443
Our house.

28:19.560 --> 28:22.404
And this is where he wanted us to live.

28:25.320 --> 28:30.326
If there's any part
of him left, it's here.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.002
In these walls.

28:37.480 --> 28:39.687
Doris doesn't quite get it, does she?

28:40.400 --> 28:42.289
No.

28:42.640 --> 28:45.962
She thinks he just left,
like he went to work.

28:46.160 --> 28:50.324
It's better than getting hit
by some asshole driving drunk.

28:53.200 --> 28:56.522
I think it's best she doesn't understand.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.884
I wish he could watch you girls grow up.

29:11.600 --> 29:14.365
Wish he could see the women you'll be.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.209
Here you go.

29:23.680 --> 29:25.250
What's that, honey?

29:25.400 --> 29:27.164
It's for us.

29:31.440 --> 29:33.681
Where... Where did you find this?

29:45.320 --> 29:47.243
It's over here.

29:59.040 --> 30:01.566
There's no more. I checked.

30:02.240 --> 30:05.449
They're from people who were here before.

30:05.600 --> 30:07.682
How did you find out about that?

30:08.080 --> 30:09.809
Daddy told me.

30:10.640 --> 30:12.404
With the board.

30:16.560 --> 30:18.164
Come on.

30:32.680 --> 30:36.127
As friends we've gathered,
hearts are true.

30:36.280 --> 30:39.329
Spirits near, we call to you.

30:41.440 --> 30:45.130
Daddy, we found the money.

30:45.920 --> 30:47.570
Thank you.

30:53.640 --> 30:56.644
It's hard to hear him sometimes.

30:56.800 --> 30:59.565
Like a car radio when we go in a tunnel.

31:01.280 --> 31:03.123
You can hear him?

31:03.680 --> 31:05.444
Whispers.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.807
They're tough to make out.

31:07.960 --> 31:11.123
But I can hear them a little better
when I'm at the board.

31:11.360 --> 31:13.806
A lot better if I touch the planchette.

31:13.960 --> 31:15.371
Doris, this is mean.

31:15.640 --> 31:17.130
It's okay, Lina.

31:18.640 --> 31:21.405
Daddy, are you here?

31:26.800 --> 31:28.689
Stop it.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.531
Okay, then...

31:33.360 --> 31:37.331
Roger, if this is you,

31:39.800 --> 31:42.167
when I told you I was pregnant with Lina,

31:43.800 --> 31:45.962
where were you when I told you?

32:12.000 --> 32:13.684
Is she right?

32:15.880 --> 32:17.962
He doesn't really need me.

32:19.360 --> 32:21.362
Isn't that right, Daddy?

32:34.040 --> 32:35.280
What are you looking at?

32:36.760 --> 32:40.890
Sometimes I can see them through this.

32:41.880 --> 32:44.281
I haven't seen Daddy, yet.

32:45.040 --> 32:46.883
But I want to.

32:55.880 --> 32:57.245
Roger,

32:59.760 --> 33:01.808
are you really here?

33:27.720 --> 33:30.087
Look, she could have manipulated

33:30.200 --> 33:32.601
the board in any number of ways.

33:32.760 --> 33:34.842
You know that better than anyone.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.286
It's real.

33:38.120 --> 33:42.569
What we've been doing here,
what we thought we were doing here,

33:42.720 --> 33:45.121
we can truly help people.

33:45.280 --> 33:48.762
We can actually do
what we've been pretending to do.

33:50.280 --> 33:51.361
And, Lina,

33:54.080 --> 33:56.811
we can talk to Daddy again.

33:58.240 --> 34:01.289
But how, Mom? It's just a stupid game.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.328
My mother was a fortune teller.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.289
Before I was born.

34:10.960 --> 34:15.123
Read tea leaves and tarot cards.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.164
I thought it was silly.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.402
I thought she was pathetic.

34:27.120 --> 34:30.283
I thought it was all a scam.

34:34.159 --> 34:37.846
Maybe she was right.
Maybe it just skips generations.

34:41.800 --> 34:46.089
I'm gonna take this to the bank
in the morning.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.209
I knew your father would take care of us.

35:07.520 --> 35:09.284
Goodnight, Mom.

35:57.320 --> 35:59.607
Yeah, I guess I'm not allowed
over there anymore.

35:59.800 --> 36:02.007
Ellie's mom called my dad and he flipped.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.889
Hell, it's not like he
isn't hittin' one bottle

36:04.000 --> 36:05.729
or another before he comes home from work.

36:05.880 --> 36:07.166
Were you serious?

36:07.320 --> 36:08.765
About what?

36:09.680 --> 36:11.569
About homecoming.

36:11.880 --> 36:13.325
Why?

36:15.240 --> 36:16.844
I don't know.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.331
I mean, yeah.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.562
Yeah, sure I was. I mean,
we could go if you wanted to.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.724
Or not. It's just a dumb dance.

36:24.720 --> 36:25.960
I do.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.764
Want to go.

36:29.440 --> 36:30.441
Great.

36:30.560 --> 36:32.130
Sorry, um...

36:32.680 --> 36:36.048
I'm just surprised. You seem
too cool for these kinds of things.

36:36.600 --> 36:37.886
I'm not.

36:38.600 --> 36:41.001
I'm not cool, I mean.

36:41.760 --> 36:43.569
No, but you're wrong about that.

36:49.960 --> 36:51.450
Mr. Russell.

36:53.600 --> 36:56.206
Not much room for the Holy Ghost,
is there, Mikey?

36:57.040 --> 36:58.530
Three's a crowd?

36:59.160 --> 37:02.562
Ms. Zander, could I have a word?

37:03.600 --> 37:08.448
No offense, Father, but I don't need to make
room for another ghost in my life right now.

37:08.640 --> 37:10.165
Holy or not.

37:10.280 --> 37:12.282
No, it's not about that.

37:12.520 --> 37:14.648
You're a smart young lady.

37:14.800 --> 37:18.600
I imagine you can trust yourself
not to make bad decisions.

37:20.200 --> 37:23.204
But boys his age,
they require discouragement.

37:23.360 --> 37:25.203
Makes them better men in the long run.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.360
Oh, well, thank you.

37:28.440 --> 37:29.851
I guess.

37:30.440 --> 37:33.922
I actually wanted to talk
to you about your sister.

37:34.120 --> 37:38.762
It's four days in a row now that
she's been absent. Why is that?

37:41.960 --> 37:43.644
It's complicated.

37:45.360 --> 37:47.283
Usually when she's sick,
your mother sends a note

37:47.440 --> 37:50.011
or she comes by and picks up her homework.

37:50.200 --> 37:52.123
She's not sick.

37:52.960 --> 37:54.007
Um...

37:55.320 --> 37:58.369
She and my mom have been working.

38:00.400 --> 38:02.562
What do you mean?

38:03.560 --> 38:05.881
Let's see if we can't reach your father.

38:06.520 --> 38:08.488
What do you wanna tell him?

38:09.960 --> 38:10.961
Um...

38:13.280 --> 38:15.328
Do I make him proud?

38:15.960 --> 38:18.804
Is he proud of me?

38:31.760 --> 38:33.125
Always.

38:37.520 --> 38:39.045
That tickled.

38:51.560 --> 38:55.246
I can't thank you enough.
That was amazing.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.004
Can I come back tomorrow?

38:57.160 --> 38:59.731
Of course. It's our pleasure.

39:25.160 --> 39:26.491
Lina.

39:28.720 --> 39:30.131
Lina.

39:32.400 --> 39:35.290
My neck hurts.

39:35.440 --> 39:38.728
Take this. If it gets worse,
we'll wake Mom up.

39:38.880 --> 39:40.609
It stings.

39:40.760 --> 39:42.489
Like a bee.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.121
It'll feel better in a bit.

39:47.560 --> 39:49.164
Goodnight, squirt.

40:18.280 --> 40:20.931
As friends we've gathered,
blah, blah, blah...

40:21.080 --> 40:23.481
What happened to my neck?

40:32.960 --> 40:36.931
Daddy, it hurts.

41:48.160 --> 41:49.161
This was a game.

43:53.680 --> 43:56.126
Mabel, Mabel, set the table

43:56.320 --> 43:58.607
Do it as fast as you are able

43:58.760 --> 44:02.810
Don't forget the salt,
pepper ketchup, mustard

44:03.320 --> 44:04.526
Check out the freak.

44:05.320 --> 44:06.731
She's so weird.

44:10.600 --> 44:12.045
Oh! What are you doing?

44:15.920 --> 44:17.729
Hey, keep an eye out.

44:34.400 --> 44:35.890
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing it.

44:36.040 --> 44:37.041
Stop it!

44:37.240 --> 44:38.890
Stop it, Jack!

44:51.840 --> 44:54.366
At Cape Canaveral,
another probe into space.

44:54.520 --> 44:56.761
Target, the Moon. A 52 ton...

44:56.960 --> 44:59.201
Lina, you call the restaurant
if you need anything.

45:00.280 --> 45:02.248
- Mom!
- What?

45:02.560 --> 45:04.767
No. You just look...

45:05.040 --> 45:06.644
What?

45:07.080 --> 45:08.080
Nothing.

45:08.160 --> 45:10.000
Nothing, you just look nice.

45:10.080 --> 45:11.844
I'll be a few hours, tops.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.720
In bed by 9:00 and you have the number
for the restaurant if anything...

45:15.800 --> 45:16.760
I know.

45:16.840 --> 45:17.880
Homework.

45:17.960 --> 45:18.960
I know!

45:19.040 --> 45:20.041
Go.

45:42.560 --> 45:43.686
I'm sorry I'm late.

45:43.880 --> 45:45.484
Oh, no, not at all. Please.

45:45.680 --> 45:47.250
This is lovely.

45:47.400 --> 45:50.847
I've been by it so many times
but I've never come inside.

45:51.040 --> 45:53.691
Well, I thought you could use
a night away from cooking.

45:53.840 --> 45:54.880
You're absolutely right.

45:54.960 --> 45:57.968
Some nights I'm so frazzled, I don't
even bother to heat up the SpaghettiOs.

45:59.040 --> 46:01.008
Oh, God. Please forget that.

46:02.280 --> 46:04.123
I'm really not a bad mother.

46:04.760 --> 46:07.920
Oh, I have cold SpaghettiOs twice a week.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.401
Twice a week at least.
I keep a case at the rectory.

46:11.360 --> 46:13.886
Actually, I invited you here because

46:14.000 --> 46:16.446
I wanted to discuss the girls and home.

46:16.600 --> 46:19.126
Out of their earshot.

46:20.520 --> 46:22.682
I won't have it, Lizzie.

46:23.200 --> 46:24.884
I'll die first.

46:25.040 --> 46:26.201
Hey, come on in.

46:26.360 --> 46:27.361
Hey.

46:27.720 --> 46:29.245
But I don't have to die, do I?

46:30.120 --> 46:31.121
Oh, hello, kiddo.

46:31.280 --> 46:33.282
Hey, thanks for...

46:33.560 --> 46:36.882
Well, I have some records up in my room
and she's just gonna watch TV,

46:37.040 --> 46:39.122
so, we should go

46:39.720 --> 46:41.404
upstairs.

46:41.560 --> 46:44.166
I do what I have to do.

46:47.600 --> 46:49.045
If you tell Mom he was here,

46:49.240 --> 46:51.721
I promise you I'm going to melt
each and every single one of your dolls

46:51.880 --> 46:54.884
until they're just a giant blob of hair
and arms. Do you understand?

46:55.080 --> 46:57.082
As soon as I saw the ax, I knew.

46:57.240 --> 46:58.924
Wait, Emma.

46:59.480 --> 47:01.369
I'm not an expert on the occult.

47:01.920 --> 47:04.321
I'm not either, to be honest.

47:04.480 --> 47:06.926
But the spirit world is dangerous.

47:07.080 --> 47:11.563
The thing is though, what we do
for people, it's not dangerous.

47:11.680 --> 47:13.680
It's good, Father.

47:13.760 --> 47:15.091
It's good work.

47:17.520 --> 47:22.242
I wish you'd let me show you,
and let me help you talk to your wife.

47:25.920 --> 47:27.763
I'm sorry. I'm just...

47:28.680 --> 47:31.809
I assumed you'd want to.

47:31.960 --> 47:33.883
Who says I don't want to?

47:35.640 --> 47:39.050
I didn't have a chance to tell her
all the things I wanted to tell her

47:39.200 --> 47:40.611
before she passed away.

47:40.720 --> 47:42.449
Hmm. We never do.

47:43.440 --> 47:49.800
But I've always felt
that anything I didn't say,

47:52.040 --> 47:54.281
she already knows.

47:58.920 --> 48:02.242
Gloria and I, we used to
come here once a month.

48:02.440 --> 48:04.920
Roger always ordered wine
in a French accent.

48:05.480 --> 48:07.482
It was so bad.

48:13.480 --> 48:16.802
It felt like those days
were over for me, so...

48:18.160 --> 48:20.686
I felt that they were, after...

48:24.040 --> 48:26.327
Well, I guess I kind of
made sure of that, didn't I?

48:26.600 --> 48:28.967
Yeah, if they weren't over
before the seminary...

48:29.120 --> 48:30.406
I didn't think this through.

48:36.200 --> 48:38.089
Maybe in another life.

48:41.800 --> 48:43.962
Here's to another life, then.

48:54.480 --> 48:57.689
You know, it's awesome
you don't have to move.

48:57.840 --> 49:00.525
Such a great house.

49:00.680 --> 49:03.001
It's classic. It's great bones.

49:03.560 --> 49:05.005
Um...

49:05.400 --> 49:09.166
Sorry, my dad's an architect.

49:09.880 --> 49:11.400
His idea of a good time

49:11.480 --> 49:14.529
is driving me and my brother
around and looking at houses.

49:14.720 --> 49:15.880
Yeah?

49:15.960 --> 49:17.041
Yeah.

49:19.600 --> 49:21.523
Yeah, I'm really glad you're not moving.

49:24.560 --> 49:26.847
My mom's gonna be home soon.

49:28.400 --> 49:30.721
I thought you said another hour.

49:31.920 --> 49:34.048
I'm not taking any chances.

49:35.560 --> 49:37.085
She'll seriously kill you.

49:37.280 --> 49:39.282
And me.

49:39.720 --> 49:41.404
Romeo and Juliet.

49:41.920 --> 49:43.729
More like Bonnie and Clyde.

49:43.880 --> 49:46.042
Sadly, for us.

49:50.080 --> 49:51.241
Well...

50:14.440 --> 50:15.601
Goodnight.

50:17.600 --> 50:18.965
Goodnight.

50:37.280 --> 50:38.725
Later, kiddo.

50:46.960 --> 50:48.121
Christ.

50:48.280 --> 50:49.884
You scared the crap out of me.

50:50.040 --> 50:51.929
Wanna hear something cool?

50:52.600 --> 50:53.726
Sure.

50:54.280 --> 50:57.363
Do you know what it feels like
to be strangled to death?

50:59.280 --> 51:02.250
First, you feel
the pressure in your throat.

51:02.800 --> 51:04.882
Your eyes water

51:05.320 --> 51:09.166
and you start to taste something very,

51:09.600 --> 51:12.171
very sour in your mouth.

51:12.640 --> 51:15.405
Then, it's like someone lights a match

51:15.520 --> 51:18.330
right in the middle of your chest.

51:18.480 --> 51:20.960
And that fire grows.

51:21.120 --> 51:25.444
It fills your lungs and your throat,

51:25.640 --> 51:28.325
and all the way behind your eyes.

51:28.520 --> 51:32.720
And finally that fire turns to ice,

51:32.800 --> 51:37.880
like pins and needles of ice
are sticking into your fingers,

51:37.960 --> 51:41.851
your toes, your arms.

51:42.000 --> 51:46.210
You see stars, then darkness.

51:46.360 --> 51:50.524
And the last thing you feel, is cold.

51:57.360 --> 51:59.124
Goodnight, Romeo.

53:02.280 --> 53:04.851
What the hell did you do this for?

53:06.640 --> 53:07.641
I didn't.

53:07.800 --> 53:09.928
Dad gave me this and you know that!

53:10.120 --> 53:11.884
I didn't do it!

53:12.240 --> 53:13.480
Daddy did.

53:14.080 --> 53:15.445
To stop the voices.

53:15.600 --> 53:16.761
You stop this, Doris.

53:16.960 --> 53:18.928
This isn't funny anymore. You stop it!

53:19.080 --> 53:20.081
What?

53:20.440 --> 53:21.771
What is all the yelling?

53:22.120 --> 53:23.565
Look what she did!

53:26.800 --> 53:28.245
Did you do this?

53:28.400 --> 53:29.360
No!

53:29.440 --> 53:30.965
She's lying.

53:31.400 --> 53:33.280
Something is wrong with her.

53:33.360 --> 53:34.920
You're either too stupid
or too stubborn to see it!

53:35.000 --> 53:36.440
You watch your tongue, young lady.

53:36.520 --> 53:38.807
You two can live in
this fantasy world all you want,

53:38.960 --> 53:40.849
but you can leave me out of it.

53:41.080 --> 53:44.004
And you know what?
You can leave Dad out of it, too.

53:50.360 --> 53:52.601
You can't talk to me that way.

53:53.520 --> 53:55.363
I don't know how else to make you hear me.

53:55.520 --> 53:58.490
Your sister, she's been through
just as much as you have.

53:58.640 --> 54:00.847
She's dealing with the same things
that you're dealing with.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.320
Something is wrong with Doris, Mom!

54:02.400 --> 54:03.640
She's experiencing something amazing!

54:03.840 --> 54:05.444
So am I!

54:05.600 --> 54:08.331
I wish you'd join us.
It could help you heal.

54:08.480 --> 54:09.891
Have you listened to what she's saying?

54:10.040 --> 54:11.565
What that stupid board is actually saying?

54:11.680 --> 54:13.170
Yes! Every day!

54:13.320 --> 54:14.321
Basic things!

54:14.520 --> 54:17.126
Forgiveness, "I'm so proud of you."
"I miss you."

54:17.280 --> 54:20.969
Things that you used to tell your clients
because you knew they'd wanna believe it.

54:21.120 --> 54:23.043
You know how that works, you taught me!

54:23.200 --> 54:25.248
No! She knows things!

54:25.400 --> 54:28.210
I asked her specific questions.

54:28.360 --> 54:29.361
You heard me.

54:29.520 --> 54:32.000
Things only he could know.

54:32.360 --> 54:34.567
How do you explain that?

54:39.360 --> 54:40.771
I can't.

54:43.480 --> 54:44.527
I'm sorry.

54:44.880 --> 54:47.486
I know this is hard to accept, honey,

54:47.600 --> 54:50.206
but something is happening here

54:50.360 --> 54:52.203
that we can't understand.

54:52.360 --> 54:54.806
It's changing Doris.

54:54.960 --> 54:59.204
It's changing her and I know
you see that, at least a little.

54:59.400 --> 55:05.328
And if it was Dad, if it really was him,
then why would he change her?

55:05.480 --> 55:08.131
Why would he ever do
anything to change her?

55:23.520 --> 55:24.931
We're gonna be late.

55:25.080 --> 55:26.764
I don't wanna go to school.

55:26.920 --> 55:28.649
I know, honey, but we've missed too much.

55:28.840 --> 55:30.330
Did you do your homework?

55:30.480 --> 55:33.882
I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go,
I don't wanna. I don't wanna go!

55:37.400 --> 55:40.722
Lina, will you get your sister's
things out of her room?

55:40.880 --> 55:43.611
No! I don't want to go.

55:43.760 --> 55:47.481
I wanna stay here and talk to my friends.

56:21.120 --> 56:23.282
Lina. Come in.

56:24.440 --> 56:25.726
Father.

56:26.400 --> 56:28.402
What can I do for you?

56:31.400 --> 56:33.971
I don't know how to ask you this,

56:35.720 --> 56:38.963
but is there anyone at this school
who speaks Polish?

56:39.120 --> 56:40.121
Um...

56:40.440 --> 56:42.727
I'm not sure. Why?

56:44.920 --> 56:47.969
I found these at my house and...

56:49.560 --> 56:51.480
I just wanna know what they say.

56:51.560 --> 56:54.450
I think they may be in Polish, but...

56:56.440 --> 56:58.283
Doris wrote them.

56:58.640 --> 56:59.641
I'm not sure I understand...

56:59.760 --> 57:00.807
I saw her.

57:06.120 --> 57:08.720
I believe Sister Hanna came here

57:08.800 --> 57:11.371
from Poland during the war. I can...

57:12.960 --> 57:14.689
I can ask her to look at them.

57:17.200 --> 57:18.201
Lina?

57:19.920 --> 57:21.649
What are these?

57:22.760 --> 57:26.162
Hopefully nothing, Father.

58:01.560 --> 58:03.608
Father. Um...

58:04.200 --> 58:05.725
What a nice surprise.

58:05.880 --> 58:08.040
I'm sorry to call on you like this.

58:08.120 --> 58:10.487
I was hoping I could
take you up on that reading.

58:11.080 --> 58:12.844
Oh, uh...

58:14.160 --> 58:16.561
Well, please come in.

58:17.800 --> 58:20.770
...U.S. astronauts in 1970.

58:21.240 --> 58:23.208
Gotta say, I'm surprised. I thought...

58:23.600 --> 58:25.841
I thought you were against the idea of...

58:26.000 --> 58:27.161
I changed my mind.

58:27.560 --> 58:29.840
...virtually every record
in manned space flight.

58:29.920 --> 58:32.048
Astronauts walk and work,
their capsules...

58:32.440 --> 58:34.283
Hi, Father.

58:34.760 --> 58:36.728
Lina, hi.

58:37.520 --> 58:42.003
I thought I would see firsthand
what all the fuss was about.

58:42.200 --> 58:44.560
Doris, would you be willing to...

58:44.640 --> 58:47.484
...in a series of pinpoint,
bullseye splash-downs.

59:00.640 --> 59:03.450
Gloria was your wife's name, right?

59:04.360 --> 59:05.725
That's right.

59:06.280 --> 59:09.887
Gloria, are you here?

59:20.200 --> 59:21.440
Darling.

59:23.400 --> 59:25.880
She's a little hard to hear.

59:34.680 --> 59:35.727
You miss me.

59:40.280 --> 59:42.282
Gloria, what's your middle name?

59:52.320 --> 59:53.651
Lynn?

59:54.200 --> 59:55.201
Is that right?

59:56.880 --> 59:58.370
Remarkable.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.320
You forgive me?

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.291
For what?

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.245
Thank you, love.

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:26.808
But what was that fight about?

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:35.451
She says it's not important.

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:41.161
"Don't

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:43.881
"hide

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.891
"behind

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:51.888
"collar.

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:59.800
"Want you to be..."

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:00.961
Happy.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.602
That was something.

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.721
Thank you, Doris, for doing that.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.969
I'm afraid that's
not the only reason I came by.

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.720
Lina's gotten herself
into some trouble at school.

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:28.880
What?

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.450
Isn't that right, Lina?

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.491
I'm sorry, Mom.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.325
What kind of trouble?

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:38.164
I'd rather not talk about it here.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.288
Is there some place we
can speak in private?

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.521
Um, we can talk in your
office in the morning?

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.131
I'd prefer to speak to you about it

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.651
right now, if that's all right.

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.165
I promise it won't take long.

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.164
We could go up to my room.

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:53.643
I wanna come.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.404
How old are you now, Doris?

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.641
Nine.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:01.122
Nine? Well, you're
practically a young lady.

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:04.240
You think you could manage to hold down
the fort on your own for a few minutes?

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.446
Are you up for that?

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.685
What's this about, Father?

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:15.848
Can I watch TV?

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.650
Of course.

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:31.163
It's right this way.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.005
Where did she write them?

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.605
Over there.

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.250
Where are you going?

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:43.003
Mom, please.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.207
My wife's middle name was Catherine.

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:50.881
I'm sorry, I...

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.844
Is this about your reading?

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:56.370
My mother's middle name was Lynn.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:59.684
Did you see her writing these?
Actually writing them?

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.450
Yes. Right over there.

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:05.964
Sometimes the medium gets confused.
Different voices...

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.044
I tricked her.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.371
What are those?

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.809
"Do not believe every spirit, but test

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.763
"the spirits to see
whether they are from God.

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:20.605
"For many false prophets
have gone out into the world."

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:23.525
John 4:1.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:25.884
I thought this was about Lina.

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:28.769
It's about all of you.

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:30.601
Please.

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.410
She started by calling me darling.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:40.721
An easy guess.

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:42.809
A common term of endearment.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.570
Then said she missed me.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.085
An appeal to comfort.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:49.844
Did you bring me up here to tell me
my 9-year-old daughter is a fraud?

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.085
Oh, no.

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.083
I don't think she's a fraud.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.924
Not at all.

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.840
When I asked for Gloria's middle name,

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.924
I thought the word
"Lynn" as hard as I could.

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.526
I repeated it over and over in my mind.

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.330
Why would you do that?

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.960
Because when we ask a question
we know the answer to,

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:14.284
we think the answer as we ask it.

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:15.771
That's right.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.207
And she was listening to me.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:22.444
I thought "Lynn," she said Lynn.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:25.444
When I asked what our fight was about,

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:26.806
I cleared my mind.

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:30.646
Just imagined static on a television set.

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:32.810
She changed the subject.

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:35.202
Your wife's voice?

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:37.566
We all heard it.

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.210
It was a woman's voice.

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:40.486
That's all.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:41.880
Just a woman's voice.

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:45.200
I'm so shocked to hear it
come from her mouth.

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:50.127
I don't really scrutinize whether
it sounded exactly like Gloria.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.004
And she only says one word.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:56.163
Enough for me to hear it's a woman,
but not enough for anything else.

01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:01.008
Accent, inflection, nothing too familiar.

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:06.169
I don't think your daughter is a fraud.

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:11.322
I believe she is channeling
powers and forces

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.005
we do not understand.

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:18.041
But I'm certain she was not
channeling my wife.

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.683
Keep your badge on.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.249
Hey, Doris.

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.129
What's the skinny?

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.051
Is Lina home?

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.685
Come in.

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:45.368
Actually, not right now.

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:49.170
She and Mom are talking
to the man about us.

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.887
They'll be right back.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.727
They... They left you here alone?

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.484
They'll be here any minute.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:01.567
She said you should wait.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.565
Yeah?

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:07.331
Wanna see something neat?

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.165
You know, maybe I should...

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:11.407
I should come back later.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:14.245
There's treasure in the walls.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.767
We used it to pay the bills.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.562
Yeah, I heard about that. Kind of.

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.241
The treasure in the walls,
is that for real?

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.084
I'll show you.

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:34.365
She'll be here any second.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:39.764
This is something Doris wrote.

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:43.251
Sister Hanna came here
from Poland during the war.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.926
I asked her to translate them.

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.048
It upset her a great deal.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:50.282
This is a journal from a man named Marcus,

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:52.926
who grew up in Poland
during the Second World War.

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:58.442
It talks about his family
and how they were rounded up

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.921
by the Germans during the invasion.

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.243
It's this way.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:08.928
I found a hole in the wall behind
the furnace, and the money was inside.

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:12.927
It was old and dusty.

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:15.642
I think there's more.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:19.128
And it talks about a doctor at the camps.

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:24.402
They called him the Devil's Doctor
because of his interest in the occult

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:28.286
and the experiments
he'd conduct on the patients.

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:31.604
He talks about being
rescued by the Allies.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:36.600
He came to America and lived on the streets,
ended up in a mental hospital.

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:39.445
I found some jewelry in there, too.

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:41.602
But I put it back.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.285
For later.

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:52.200
He recognized one of the doctors
using a different name,

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:55.011
but he knew it was the Devil's Doctor.

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:59.040
It's not unlikely a lot of them
fled to America after the war.

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:03.205
And then one night, the doctor
took him out of the hospital

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.966
and brought him to his house.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.963
He describes the house.

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:09.521
This house.

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:15.523
He says the doctor had
a secret room in the basement

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:20.049
where the experiments continued
on Marcus and others.

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.162
He cut out their tongues,

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:39.368
he severed their vocal cords
and sealed their mouths.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.203
Kept them in the secret basement,

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:44.728
so even as people visited
and socialized upstairs,

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.564
they couldn't be heard below.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:49.881
My God.

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:54.523
And he describes his
murder in great detail.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.569
His murder?

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.242
The journal doesn't stop there.

01:09:00.399 --> 01:09:02.720
There could be so much more in there.

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.609
It talks about after.

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.528
After his murder?

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:09.682
Things that could help my family.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:23.600
It talks about being in the dark
with the others.

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:27.087
Voiceless, cold, insane.

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:30.562
And it talks about the other things
in the dark.

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:33.642
Things that were never human.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.041
Things that were taking him over.

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.929
You were right.

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.765
What you said about this house.

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.450
Good bones.

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:51.446
No.

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:54.250
She knew things.

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.607
Things only Roger and I knew.

01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.127
I asked...

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:00.720
You asked about things
that happened inside the house.

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:04.288
Things that you and Dad
said and did after you moved in.

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:06.440
Of course they knew all of the answers.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:08.443
They were here in the house even then.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.325
They were watching.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:18.247
So we move. We get her out of the house.

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:21.523
The problem isn't the house. Not anymore.

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:23.205
I've called the archdiocese.

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:26.085
The Vatican has people
who investigate these things.

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.203
I'll ask them to approve an exorcism.

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.485
Shh. Don't say anything else.

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:35.720
They were watching us all of
those years inside the house.

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.484
Everything we did.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.480
That means they're watching us now.

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.688
Doris? Honey?

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:39.726
I'll bring her down.

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:43.160
When I've got her,
and we get her outside...

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:50.041
No. No, no, no! No!

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:51.721
No! No!

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:53.325
Honey. Honey, look at me.

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:54.805
No! No! No! No!

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.200
Look at me.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:57.361
Look at me.

01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.409
- Look at me.
- No!

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:01.688
We have to find your sister.

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.887
What's that?

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.525
The basement.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.525
Lina, wait outside.

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:34.841
No.

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:39.411
No way. No, that's my sister.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:44.520
This is my house, and I'm going with you.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:48.883
Besides,

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:52.806
splitting up sounds like
the stupidest idea in the world.

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:55.131
Okay, then.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:00.081
But if we're going down there,
we're burning that thing in the furnace.

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:13.805
Doris?

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:23.005
Doris?

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:25.242
Honey?

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.764
Let's burn that.

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.884
They're in here.

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:21.641
All of them.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.367
We played in a graveyard.

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:31.643
Think that'll work?

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.689
I honestly don't know.

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:35.921
Mom!

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:38.730
Mom, help!

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:40.964
I'm scared.

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:43.370
Mommy, help.

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.926
You stay here with your daughter.

01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:53.403
What about staying together?

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:59.564
If she's in there, I'll bring her out.

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:27.327
That's where we died.

01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:31.210
Our Father, who art in Heaven...

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.970
He can't see this house, Father.

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:36.488
If he could, none of us
would still be here.

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.849
You're not Doris.

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.204
Is Doris still here?

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:52.206
I'm sorry this happened to you.

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:54.046
Come with me.

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.043
I can help you.

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:59.601
Yea, though I walk through
the valley in the shadow of death...

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:02.041
I shall fear no evil.

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:29.085
Father?

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:33.801
Where is she?

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:37.086
She's part of the walls now.

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:45.086
And she told me
the most wonderful, awful things.

01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:57.441
No, no!

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:01.524
Tom.

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:27.921
Mom! Mom!

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:29.246
You gotta get out of here!

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.808
What do we do?

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:50.486
I don't...

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:52.240
Mom!

01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:34.521
Stop it.

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:37.485
Let her go.

01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:42.685
Speak to me.

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:44.881
I'm a vessel.

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:47.568
I can help you.

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:49.524
She's a better vessel.

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:53.162
What do you want from her?

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.691
Voice.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.202
Then take mine.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.927
You can cut it out, for all I care.
But you leave my girls alone.

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:04.681
Let them go!

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.890
Take me!

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:11.204
We'll take all of you.

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:49.447
Dad!

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:06.081
What the hell did you do this for?

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.161
I didn't.

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.761
Dad gave me this and you know that!

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:13.285
I didn't do it!

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:15.770
Daddy did.

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:18.048
To stop the voices.

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.808
I didn't do it!

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:35.804
Daddy did.

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.482
To stop the voices.

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:12.171
Sweetie, don't.

01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:18.124
I just wanted to be able
to talk to Daddy again.

01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:21.523
I just wanted you to be
able to talk to Daddy.

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:23.921
He's gone.

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:27.280
He lives in the dark and the cold

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:30.489
and he screams and screams and...

01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:34.725
No, he doesn't.

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:43.561
Lina?

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:45.326
I'm sorry, Doris.

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:13.091
Daddy.

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:43.085
Doris?

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:45.885
Doris?

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:56.125
No.

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:01.244
No, no, no, no, no.

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:03.881
No.

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:08.443
No.

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:14.444
Oh, God.

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.329
My baby.

01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:18.970
I had to.

01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:23.128
To stop the voices.

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:46.324
I'm sorry.

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:53.323
I'm sorry.

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.285
Mom!

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.161
Mom.

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:27.446
Mom.

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:29.160
It wasn't you.

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:32.325
Wasn't you.

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:36.642
It was my fault.

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:42.160
I love you.

01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:46.688
I love you, too.

01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.563
Doris?

01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:12.524
Everybody's waiting.

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:29.081
No, I'm sorry!

01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:31.960
Oh, God!

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:39.009
Hey, Lina.

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:42.171
Lina?

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:43.881
Lina.

01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:49.563
Where did you go just now?

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:54.127
What were we talking about?

01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:56.724
Your sister.

01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:58.484
Again.

01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:01.246
Right.

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.440
Right.

01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:06.360
What about her?

01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:10.160
I need you to try to remember

01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:15.565
anything at all that can help us find her.
Or her body if she's...

01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:17.449
Of course.

01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:19.521
Of course.

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:21.924
I'm sorry.

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:25.404
My mother might know.

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:26.891
I think she said something about where...

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.405
We've been over this.

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:32.206
She's dead because you...

01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:36.122
Right. Of course.

01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:40.084
You've been here two months, Lina.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:44.404
We can't find your sister and still,

01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:48.249
we can't have a proper conversation
about what happened to your mother.

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:50.084
My mother.

01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:57.165
Really, the only thing that I can
say about my mother is that

01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:02.687
she wanted to know that we
weren't alone after my dad died.

01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:08.051
And now she knows.

01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:12.602
We were never alone.

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:16.211
I'll never be alone.

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:22.966
I'll never be alone again.

01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:06.650
Doris,

01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:09.491
are you there?

01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.171
Are you there?

01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:20.845
Miss Zander?

01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:24.163
You have a visitor.

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:26.801
She says she's your niece?

01:38:27.305 --> 01:38:33.503
