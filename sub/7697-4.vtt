01:31.841 --> 01:34.594
Hello, Gotham, I'm home!

01:34.677 --> 01:36.887
- Hello, Ronnie!
- Ronnie!

01:37.054 --> 01:40.016
Veronica, darling,
you look smashing.

01:40.683 --> 01:42.602
How did you like the rain forest?

01:42.685 --> 01:46.230
The food was appalling,
the accommodations were nonexistent

01:46.314 --> 01:49.150
and the bugs were the size
of my trust fund.

01:52.820 --> 01:55.990
But seriously,
it's important we all do our part

01:56.073 --> 01:58.242
to preserve those precious resources.

01:58.326 --> 02:00.494
Hear, hear.

02:02.121 --> 02:04.790
Look at them,
celebrating without a care in the world.

02:04.874 --> 02:07.084
I think it's great
that Veronica's finally

02:07.168 --> 02:09.128
doing something worthwhile
with her money.

02:09.587 --> 02:10.880
I'm sorry, Bruce.

02:10.963 --> 02:12.965
The securities business has been
kind of rough lately.

02:13.049 --> 02:14.383
Lot of late hours, you know.

02:14.717 --> 02:18.095
Seems all I do is worry about how to get
my company through one more day.

02:18.471 --> 02:21.766
Worries, Hayden?
I have the cure for that.

02:24.435 --> 02:26.479
I'm a little old for dolls,
don't you think?

02:26.937 --> 02:28.272
Not these dolls.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.233
They're Worry Men from Central America.

02:31.567 --> 02:33.527
Legends say you tell them your problems,

02:33.611 --> 02:35.571
then put them under
your pillow at night.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.990
They'll do your worrying for you
while you sleep.

02:38.449 --> 02:41.911
And when you wake up,
poof, your problems are gone.

02:41.994 --> 02:43.454
Oh, come on, Ronnie.

02:43.621 --> 02:46.666
You're the last one I'd think would
fall for some ancient tribal hoodoo.

02:46.874 --> 02:48.626
Don't be so smug, Brucie.

02:48.751 --> 02:52.254
When I was in the jungle,
I saw some things you'd never believe.

03:08.938 --> 03:12.274
And I tell you, I haven't had
a bad night's sleep since my trip.

03:12.733 --> 03:14.318
Well, sounds great to me.

03:16.570 --> 03:19.699
In fact, the little darlings work
their magic for me all daylong.

03:21.784 --> 03:23.953
See, aren't they precious?

03:27.289 --> 03:29.792
- I just couldn't get along without them.
- Thanks for everything, Ron.

03:29.875 --> 03:31.711
But I've got a few more rounds to make.

03:33.003 --> 03:37.550
If ever someone led a worry-free life,
it's you, Bruce Wayne.

03:45.266 --> 03:47.435
I've got one for everybody.

03:48.936 --> 03:50.271
Party crasher.

04:04.243 --> 04:05.578
Nasty toy.

04:18.174 --> 04:19.675
Ready to call it a night?

05:02.718 --> 05:04.720
Oh, my heavens!

06:14.248 --> 06:15.291
Tell me, Alfred.

06:15.374 --> 06:18.878
What's an ancient Mayan witch doctor
doing on a Gotham skyscraper?

06:19.128 --> 06:21.589
This isn't one
of those Riddler questions, is it?

06:22.298 --> 06:24.174
No, but it's just as confusing.

06:24.341 --> 06:28.178
There's someone new in town using
Mayan tribal gimmicks in his crimes.

06:28.345 --> 06:32.141
- Blowguns, stone weapons.
- Voodoo dolls?

06:32.433 --> 06:35.019
That's some party favor
from Veronica's party.

06:35.102 --> 06:37.271
They're supposed to take away
your worries while you sleep.

06:37.688 --> 06:38.814
Imagine that.

06:38.939 --> 06:42.526
What some overworked souls
won't do to get a good night's rest.

06:43.485 --> 06:44.612
Hmm.

06:45.613 --> 06:47.406
Still, every little bit helps.

06:58.042 --> 07:01.170
I tell you, child, I handle
all sorts of things for Mr. Wayne,

07:01.253 --> 07:03.839
but this one really takes the cake.

07:07.551 --> 07:10.137
- Oh, Morning, Dana.
- Oh, I gotta go. Bye-bye.

07:19.980 --> 07:22.566
Sometimes I forget how beautiful
Gotham can be.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.736
You're in fine spirits, I must say.

07:28.572 --> 07:31.784
A good night's sleep
and I'm ready to take on the world.

07:32.159 --> 07:33.202
You got everything all right?

07:33.285 --> 07:35.829
Yes, I followed your message
to the letter.

07:35.913 --> 07:38.707
- But I can't help wondering what-
- Thank you.

08:15.285 --> 08:19.581
I know it's your company, Mr. Wayne,
but $20 million, man.

08:19.665 --> 08:23.210
- That's a lot of money.
- Yes, it is. What's your point?

08:23.293 --> 08:26.547
Well, I'd sure feel uncomfortable
walking around with all that cash

08:26.630 --> 08:28.465
in a tiny little briefcase.

08:28.549 --> 08:32.428
Dana, I'm sorry. I'm not following this.
What cash? What briefcase?

08:32.803 --> 08:36.473
The $20 million you told me
to put in a briefcase for you.

08:37.016 --> 08:38.642
You're not making any sense.

08:38.726 --> 08:41.478
The $20 million I told you
to put in a briefcase?

08:41.562 --> 08:44.481
You called me from your car,
gave me your account number,

08:44.565 --> 08:48.485
told me to transfer $20 million
in cash and...

08:56.577 --> 08:57.786
Hey!

08:58.996 --> 09:02.166
$20 million of my money in that case?

09:02.499 --> 09:05.461
I hope you're not going to take it
out of my salary.

09:13.677 --> 09:15.554
<i>Tens of millions of dollars are missing</i>

09:15.637 --> 09:16.805
<i>since this morning, Mr. Sloane.</i>

09:16.889 --> 09:18.515
<i>If it wasn't you, then who?</i>

09:18.599 --> 09:22.936
<i>But I don't know, I tell you.
I don't know. Why would I do it? Why?</i>

09:23.020 --> 09:26.148
<i>That was the scene today
as broker Hayden Sloane was arrested</i>

09:26.231 --> 09:27.608
<i>on charges of embezzlement.</i>

09:27.691 --> 09:31.487
<i>Sloane joins the growing list of wealthy
Gothamites who, for reasons unknown,</i>

09:31.570 --> 09:36.450
<i>have pilfered their own companies
for a combined total of $100 million.</i>

09:38.410 --> 09:39.828
Unbelievable.

09:40.537 --> 09:42.956
And you have no clue
how this could have happened?

09:43.040 --> 09:47.336
I do now. Each of us was a guest
at Veronica Vreeland's party.

09:48.295 --> 09:50.798
If there are answers, she's got them.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.314
Miss Vreeland.

10:07.648 --> 10:08.732
Huh?

10:12.736 --> 10:14.196
Batman?

10:15.322 --> 10:17.324
Let me help you with your bag.

10:18.033 --> 10:19.618
No, you stay back.

10:19.952 --> 10:22.246
This is mine, you hear? Mine.

10:25.916 --> 10:29.002
I know it's yours.
What were you planning to do with it?

10:29.086 --> 10:32.089
I have to throw it overboard because...

10:32.256 --> 10:33.465
Because...

10:33.549 --> 10:36.552
Excuse me, I don't feel very well.

10:49.857 --> 10:51.316
Care to explain these?

10:53.360 --> 10:56.029
My jewels! How did they get here?

10:56.113 --> 11:00.450
- Don't you remember?
- No, everything's a blank. I...

11:17.593 --> 11:19.428
Leave him alone, you swine!

11:20.345 --> 11:21.430
Please?

11:39.198 --> 11:41.700
My therapist is never
going to believe this.

11:41.783 --> 11:44.703
And I thought you were supposed
to take away my worries.

11:46.788 --> 11:47.831
Hmm.

11:49.249 --> 11:52.169
Well, say goodbye,
you troublesome little trinkets.

11:54.379 --> 11:57.716
Wait. These dolls.
Where did you get them?

11:57.799 --> 12:02.679
From a craftsman at a small village.
A funny little man in a giant straw hat.

12:04.139 --> 12:05.515
An Englishman?

12:06.183 --> 12:07.476
Why, yes.

12:07.559 --> 12:10.729
And he suggested giving the dolls
to your society friends.

12:11.855 --> 12:13.440
What, are you psychic, too?

12:13.899 --> 12:16.276
Just picking up on the pattern.

12:30.707 --> 12:34.628
Sir, you have no idea how terrible
I feel to have played a part in this.

12:35.128 --> 12:38.131
Neither you nor Veronica could have
known that hidden within each doll

12:38.215 --> 12:42.010
was a tiny microchip designed
to stimulate a sleeper's brainwaves

12:42.094 --> 12:44.471
and make them susceptible
to hypnotic suggestion.

12:44.638 --> 12:49.685
Creating a radio receiver of sorts
out of an entranced human mind?

12:49.768 --> 12:50.978
Exactly.

12:59.194 --> 13:01.613
And who knows
how to warp the human mind better

13:01.697 --> 13:05.075
than Jervis Tetch, the Mad Hatter?

13:05.492 --> 13:10.956
<i>'"0 frabjous day, callooh,
callay,' he chortled in his joy."</i>

13:11.039 --> 13:13.125
It's sheer brilliance.

13:13.208 --> 13:14.960
A wonderland of treasures

13:15.043 --> 13:18.839
all willingly donated
by Gotham's simpering elite.

13:19.214 --> 13:20.215
Ah.

13:20.299 --> 13:24.511
And now come the famous Vreeland jewels
to dance at my heels.

13:26.096 --> 13:29.808
What? How dare you return empty-handed?

13:30.183 --> 13:32.728
Forgive us, sir.
But Batman showed up, and-

13:32.811 --> 13:33.937
Batman?

13:34.313 --> 13:36.815
You insufferable fools.

13:37.190 --> 13:41.278
You can't even handle one man
dressed up like a flying mouse?

13:43.947 --> 13:46.408
Oh, and what's this? What's this?

13:46.491 --> 13:49.411
You've graciously left
part of your cloak behind

13:49.494 --> 13:52.539
as Batman's invitation
to waltz right into our midst.

13:55.042 --> 13:58.003
And that's just what he'll do, won't he?

13:59.838 --> 14:01.131
Of course he will.

14:01.214 --> 14:05.385
And far be it for me to disappoint him
when he arrives.

14:30.952 --> 14:33.997
<i>As you predicted, sir,
the computer has identified</i>

14:34.081 --> 14:38.502
<i>this scrap of artificial fur as a type
used in theatrical productions,</i>

14:38.835 --> 14:41.296
<i>which would make
its most probable source of origin-</i>

14:41.380 --> 14:43.799
The Great Eastern Costume Company.

14:43.882 --> 14:45.425
It's been closed for years,

14:45.842 --> 14:48.470
making it a perfect hideout
for the Mad Hatter.

15:18.166 --> 15:20.419
<i>I knew you were coming,
so I thought</i>

15:20.502 --> 15:23.547
<i>I'd have some of the old chaps 'round
to make you feel at home.</i>

15:36.184 --> 15:39.062
<i>- How is Batman like a donut shop?</i>

15:39.813 --> 15:42.691
<i>- They're both filled with holes.</i>

16:26.526 --> 16:27.569
<i>Whoops.</i>

16:27.652 --> 16:29.988
<i>Should have warned you, old boy.</i>

16:30.238 --> 16:32.282
<i>That lot's real.</i>

17:01.436 --> 17:07.359
Delightful. Oh, quite a bonus to add
to my already-substantial collection.

17:08.568 --> 17:10.111
You disappoint me, Tetch.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.906
For all your brilliance,
you've become just another thief.

17:13.240 --> 17:16.243
You make it sound so common.

17:16.701 --> 17:18.161
Well, actually, Batman,

17:18.245 --> 17:22.499
you'll be happy to know you're
witnessing my retirement from crime.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.794
See, after my recent release
from Arkham,

17:25.877 --> 17:29.464
I vowed to leave Gotham
and my wicked ways behind me.

17:29.673 --> 17:35.178
Perhaps buy a little island somewhere
and open a sunbonnet shop.

17:35.512 --> 17:40.100
But islands, even little ones,
cost money.

17:40.809 --> 17:42.978
Lots of money.

17:43.061 --> 17:45.939
And then I heard of Ms. Vreeland's

17:46.022 --> 17:48.692
well-publicized trek
into the rain forest.

17:48.984 --> 17:55.448
Yes, I realized at once she'd be the
perfect unwitting partner in my scheme.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.536
<i>Investing what limited funds I had,</i>

17:59.619 --> 18:02.497
<i>I managed to follow dear Ronnie
into the forest</i>

18:02.581 --> 18:05.959
<i>where, at a small native village,
she made the acquaintance</i>

18:06.042 --> 18:09.004
<i>of my specially-created Worry Men.</i>

18:13.758 --> 18:16.052
Though, I can't take complete credit.

18:16.136 --> 18:18.972
I provided
the microcircuitry, of course,

18:19.055 --> 18:22.142
but my good friend here
supplied the dolls.

18:22.851 --> 18:24.477
Can you believe it?

18:24.561 --> 18:27.439
He was just an honest native craftsman

18:27.522 --> 18:30.817
until I changed his mind
about helping me.

18:30.900 --> 18:35.238
Those others are riffraff culled out of
various Gotham street gangs.

18:35.322 --> 18:37.949
Gutter trash of no great importance.

18:38.241 --> 18:40.785
So, as this is my farewell to crime,

18:40.869 --> 18:43.371
I think I'll take a souvenir
to mark the occasion.

18:48.835 --> 18:53.715
No matter. I have a better way
to remove that nasty old cowl.

19:01.389 --> 19:04.017
Stop! You don't know what you're doing.

19:22.702 --> 19:24.329
Oh, that noise!

19:26.873 --> 19:28.541
What's going on?

19:30.043 --> 19:31.503
How did I get here?

19:34.005 --> 19:35.548
Oh, you're a clever one.

19:35.632 --> 19:39.678
But I will not be denied.
As the great Lewis Carroll said,

19:39.969 --> 19:42.389
"One, two, one, two,

19:42.472 --> 19:45.975
"and through and through,
the vorpal blade went snicker-snack.

19:46.059 --> 19:49.521
"He left it dead, and with its head,
he went galumphing back."

19:57.904 --> 19:59.739
Stop! I command you.

20:00.156 --> 20:02.575
So, we're gutter trash, are we?

20:05.203 --> 20:07.122
Who's calling the shots now?

20:08.039 --> 20:10.917
- Stop!
- Yes. Stop.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.257
Leave him to the police.

20:17.841 --> 20:23.680
Thank you. Thank you, you generous,
forgiving, noble fool.

20:24.305 --> 20:25.390
Stand back, all of you.

20:25.473 --> 20:30.270
I'm getting out. But not before
I sew up one last loose end.

20:30.895 --> 20:31.938
What?

21:13.104 --> 21:15.398
Tomorrow this all goes
back to the company.

21:15.565 --> 21:19.068
Minus the cost of a plane ticket home
for our kidnapped doll maker.

21:19.152 --> 21:21.946
I must say, after all the Hatter
put him through,

21:22.030 --> 21:24.449
that fellow showed remarkable restraint.

21:24.532 --> 21:25.909
When everything was said and done,

21:25.992 --> 21:28.203
all the shaman really wanted
was to go home.

21:28.661 --> 21:32.040
<i>In fact, I hear he even sent the Hatter
a farewell gift.</i>

21:34.209 --> 21:36.252
<i>Something to ensure
that Jervis Tetch</i>

21:36.336 --> 21:39.589
<i>only dreams of a good,
honest life from now on.</i>

22:16.000 --> 22:17.001
