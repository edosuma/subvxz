00:04.375 --> 00:07.583
All right, everyone, here's the schedule
for today's trip to Super Adventure Land.

00:08.166 --> 00:10.125
I planned everything to the minute.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.250
Okay. "Depart promptly at 8:57 A.M.,
arrive SAL Parking lot, 9:33 A.M."

00:16.333 --> 00:18.583
- Question.
- SAL Stands for "Super Adventure Land."

00:18.667 --> 00:19.583
Thank you.

00:20.875 --> 00:23.125
I don't wanna take Charlie
to kiddie kingdom.

00:23.375 --> 00:26.375
Kids there always think I'm a giant
and try and climb me.

00:29.083 --> 00:34.083
"Okay, 10:41 A.M., Mom throws up
in Wally walrus trash receptacle."

00:34.458 --> 00:35.667
That's kind of specific.

00:36.250 --> 00:38.792
That's the trash can that's right
outside the Super Spinner...

00:39.250 --> 00:40.792
which we'll be riding at 10:39.

00:41.625 --> 00:42.917
Then I guess this is right.

00:44.750 --> 00:47.417
Hey, I don't see Patriotic Plaza
on this thing.

00:47.959 --> 00:50.125
Well, I wanna see the new
Founding Fathers exhibit.

00:50.208 --> 00:54.792
Dad, when the Founding Fathers can go zero
to 90 in five seconds and make mom barf,

00:55.250 --> 00:56.458
they'll make the schedule.

00:58.709 --> 01:00.250
- Hi, guys, what's going on?
- Hey, honey.

01:00.750 --> 01:03.166
Why aren't you dressed?
We're going to Super Adventure Land.

01:03.250 --> 01:05.792
Oh, man, that's today?
I was gonna look for a job.

01:06.041 --> 01:08.250
Well, do it tomorrow. Today's a big day.

01:08.333 --> 01:09.750
I want the whole family together.

01:10.083 --> 01:12.125
You just want me there
for the big family discount, right?

01:12.208 --> 01:13.667
- And there's that.
- Teddy: Yep.

01:14.417 --> 01:15.834
All right, can we move this along?

01:15.917 --> 01:18.834
I only budgeted three minutes
for an argument about Dad's cheapness.

01:19.291 --> 01:22.000
Oh, hey, with the time we save,
maybe a visit to patriotic Plaza--

All right. Time for some family fun.

02:26.458 --> 02:27.500
Right.

02:27.583 --> 02:28.792
Both: See ya.

02:31.458 --> 02:33.166
That frog is staring at you.

02:33.583 --> 02:34.625
I know.

02:34.709 --> 02:36.166
It's giving me a weird feeling.

02:36.250 --> 02:37.333
Me too. Let's go, Charlie.

02:37.542 --> 02:40.458
What? Hey.

02:42.792 --> 02:43.792
Hi, Teddy bear.

02:43.875 --> 02:44.792
Hi, Emmett.

02:45.583 --> 02:46.458
I'm working here now.

02:46.542 --> 02:47.834
Oh, good.

02:47.917 --> 02:51.750
So, you're not just cruising around
Super Adventure Land in a frog costume?

02:52.583 --> 02:53.500
Nope.

02:53.583 --> 02:55.208
- I'm actually Hoppy the frog.
- Hoppy?

02:57.500 --> 02:59.542
Every time somebody
says my name, I have to hop.

02:59.625 --> 03:01.250
Other than that, it's a great job.

03:01.667 --> 03:04.959
I just walk around, do a five-minute show
once an hour, and it pays really well.

03:05.250 --> 03:07.208
Oh, hey, are there any openings?

03:07.250 --> 03:09.500
Because I've been trying to
save up for a car.

03:09.583 --> 03:10.709
Actually someone just quit.

03:11.041 --> 03:12.458
Want me to see if I can get you in?

03:12.542 --> 03:14.500
Yeah. Thanks, Emmett.
That would make me...

03:15.250 --> 03:16.250
"Hoppy."

03:21.250 --> 03:24.000
Would you please stop following me?
I am not a giant.

03:32.583 --> 03:33.625
That was awesome!

03:33.709 --> 03:34.959
This has been the best day ever.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.583
What are you doing?

03:38.500 --> 03:42.834
Honey, I stood in line for six hours.
I've been upside down three times.

03:42.917 --> 03:44.000
I'm sitting.

03:44.875 --> 03:47.583
All right. Now, I wanna go
on one more ride before we go home.

03:48.083 --> 03:49.625
I love Super Adventure Land!

03:49.709 --> 03:51.125
Hey. Um, excuse me.

03:51.208 --> 03:52.333
I'm Danny Flufferman.

03:52.417 --> 03:54.834
I'm the director of marketing here
for Super Adventure Land.

03:55.667 --> 03:57.959
How would you like to be in a commercial?

03:58.291 --> 03:59.291
Really?

03:59.375 --> 04:00.458
But I'm not an actor.

04:00.542 --> 04:01.750
Yeah, no no. we don't want actors.

04:01.834 --> 04:04.542
We want real kids who really love
Super Adventure Land.

04:04.792 --> 04:07.417
And if you do it, I could throw in
a free one-year pass.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.667
Not good on weekends, holidays...
Rides not included.

04:10.625 --> 04:11.834
All right.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.250
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?

04:14.333 --> 04:16.750
Mom, this guy wants me to be in
a commercial for Super Adventure Land.

04:17.041 --> 04:18.792
Whoa, whoa. Slow down, everybody.

04:18.875 --> 04:20.917
Okay look, I'm not agreeing to anything.

04:21.083 --> 04:23.125
Now I've had some experience
in show business,

04:23.208 --> 04:24.834
and I don't want my son anywhere near it.

04:25.250 --> 04:26.667
Oh, that's too bad really,

04:26.750 --> 04:29.166
because it was going to be a commercial
about the boy and his mother.

04:29.250 --> 04:30.583
I'll do it.

04:31.166 --> 04:32.041
Wait,

04:32.125 --> 04:33.125
we'll do it.

04:33.208 --> 04:34.458
Whatever. Where do I sign?

04:34.959 --> 04:36.083
Oh.

04:43.458 --> 04:44.709
Hey, PJ, what smells so good?

04:44.792 --> 04:47.291
- Mom's meat loaf.
- Seriously, what smells so good?

04:48.208 --> 04:49.709
Go on, try it.

04:55.208 --> 04:56.375
Whoa. Whoa...

04:56.417 --> 04:58.542
This, this is not your mother's meat loaf.

04:58.625 --> 05:00.834
I mean, this has got, um, um, um...

05:00.917 --> 05:02.083
what, what's the word?

05:02.166 --> 05:03.959
- Flavor.
- Flavor! Yes.

05:04.041 --> 05:05.458
Mom's working late at the hospital.

05:05.542 --> 05:07.500
The ingredients were all here, so...

05:07.875 --> 05:08.875
I gave it a shot.

05:09.500 --> 05:10.667
You gave it a shot?

05:10.750 --> 05:12.417
Kid, you just hit a home run.

05:13.166 --> 05:14.291
A home run?

05:14.667 --> 05:16.166
Come on, Dad, I think you're exaggerating.

05:16.667 --> 05:17.959
I helped.

05:19.250 --> 05:20.875
Yes. Yes, you did.

05:22.333 --> 05:23.500
I did most of the work.

05:25.417 --> 05:26.375
PJ, you...

05:26.500 --> 05:27.834
You have a real gift.

05:27.959 --> 05:29.333
Hey, you think you can do this again?

05:29.875 --> 05:30.959
Well, I don't know.

05:31.041 --> 05:33.291
'Cause I'm pretty sure your mother's gonna
be working late again,

05:33.542 --> 05:34.959
especially if I call her supervisor.

05:35.542 --> 05:37.291
Oh, my brownies are done.

05:37.375 --> 05:38.333
Brownies?

05:38.375 --> 05:39.959
Be right back. I'm calling the hospital.

05:53.333 --> 05:55.125
Welcome to the
Super Adventure Land family!

05:55.208 --> 05:56.625
- I got the job?
- Hug?

05:56.834 --> 05:58.166
Answer the question.

05:59.959 --> 06:02.083
- Yes, you got the job.
- Oh yay!

06:03.458 --> 06:05.291
- You're gonna be playing a Princess.
- Ooh!

06:05.458 --> 06:07.083
A Princess? I like it.

06:07.709 --> 06:09.959
Actually we do a little show together.
Just the two of us.

06:10.917 --> 06:13.542
Why would they put a Princess
in a show with a frog?

06:17.583 --> 06:19.041
Oh, yeah.

06:21.041 --> 06:22.834
Emmett, please tell me
this isn't the story

06:22.917 --> 06:25.417
where the Princess kisses the frog
and turns him into a prince.

06:25.834 --> 06:26.959
Eight times a day

06:28.500 --> 06:29.542
and nine on Sundays.

06:30.959 --> 06:32.959
Why didn't you tell me
I'd have to kiss you?

06:33.041 --> 06:34.458
I thought it would affect your decision.

06:34.542 --> 06:37.333
Well yeah, it totally would
affect my decision.

06:40.125 --> 06:41.458
Is this why the last girl quit?

06:41.875 --> 06:43.333
Oh, yeah.

06:49.208 --> 06:50.083
Gabe,

06:50.166 --> 06:51.959
they just sent over the script
for the commercial.

06:52.041 --> 06:52.959
Cool, let's read it.

06:53.959 --> 06:54.959
Okay.

06:55.291 --> 06:56.792
"A boy and his mother

06:56.875 --> 06:58.625
walk through Super Adventure Land."

06:59.000 --> 07:01.041
Then I say,
"I love the new Super Adventure Land.

07:01.125 --> 07:03.208
The rides are faster
and the lines are shorter."

07:03.667 --> 07:05.750
"The mom smiles and nods."

07:09.250 --> 07:11.875
Then I say,
"the new Super Adventure Land is awesome."

07:12.375 --> 07:14.917
And I say, "Ad safer too."

07:18.917 --> 07:20.041
What?

07:20.542 --> 07:21.583
What, that's it?

07:22.125 --> 07:23.542
That's my only line?

07:24.250 --> 07:26.000
Well, mom, the commercial's for kids

07:26.083 --> 07:28.750
and kids kind of start zoning out
when the adults start talking.

07:30.625 --> 07:32.458
That is not true. Adults can be very--

07:33.792 --> 07:34.834
Gabe!

07:36.500 --> 07:37.875
I think we need to make a few changes.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.583
Wait.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.208
Hold on, Mom. Can we do that?

07:41.291 --> 07:42.291
Of course.

07:42.375 --> 07:44.083
Everyone knows
the script is just an outline.

07:44.750 --> 07:47.125
We'll just make a couple of small tweaks.

07:48.667 --> 07:50.917
Hi, I'm Amy Duncan,

07:52.333 --> 07:53.875
real-life mother of four.

07:54.333 --> 07:57.959
And these days, when your entertainment
dollar is stretched tighter than a drum,

07:58.375 --> 08:01.583
it's important to make the right choice
for your family's fun.

08:05.041 --> 08:07.417
That's why I, Amy Duncan,

08:07.500 --> 08:09.750
always choose Super Adventure Land.

08:11.041 --> 08:13.125
♪ When you're looking to smile ♪

08:13.208 --> 08:15.667
♪ Let me give you a hand ♪

08:16.041 --> 08:19.125
♪ It's Super Adventure Land. ♪

08:20.542 --> 08:21.583
And safer too.

08:25.208 --> 08:26.083
That is so much better.

08:32.834 --> 08:34.375
- Hey, PJ
- Hey, Dad.

08:48.834 --> 08:50.041
Whatcha doin'?

08:52.375 --> 08:53.417
Homework.

08:54.917 --> 08:55.875
Homework?

08:55.959 --> 08:56.959
Before dinner?

08:57.250 --> 08:58.750
That doesn't sound right.

09:00.333 --> 09:01.542
Well, I got a lot to do.

09:01.625 --> 09:02.834
Ah, got it.

09:03.709 --> 09:04.625
Got...

09:04.709 --> 09:05.625
it.

09:08.458 --> 09:11.417
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm sorry.
Did you hear that?

09:12.875 --> 09:13.875
Hear... hear what?

09:13.959 --> 09:15.125
Tummy's grumbling.

09:15.208 --> 09:17.500
You know, what with your mother
working late and all...

09:18.375 --> 09:20.250
Okay, Dad, I'd cook something for you,

09:20.333 --> 09:21.458
but I've really gotta finish.

09:22.250 --> 09:23.458
Or...

09:24.375 --> 09:27.500
you could cook and I could
do your homework.

09:28.041 --> 09:30.667
And you know what?
I happen to be very good at "Trigometry."

09:32.500 --> 09:33.834
It's my second love.

09:34.792 --> 09:37.667
Dad, your second love
is pronounced "Trigonometry."

09:40.166 --> 09:42.667
And even if I wanted to cook,
we don't have anything to make.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.375
Oh, man.

09:45.166 --> 09:47.250
Wish I had stopped off at the store
on the way home.

09:47.333 --> 09:48.917
Oh, uh, wait a minute.

09:51.500 --> 09:52.583
I did.

09:53.625 --> 09:54.667
Okay, come on.

09:54.750 --> 09:56.834
You get up there and you start cooking,

09:57.625 --> 09:59.583
and I will hit the books.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.834
- Dad, are you sure about this?
- Absolutely.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.000
Wow.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.125
Number and letters, huh?

10:13.375 --> 10:14.291
It's fun.

10:21.458 --> 10:23.667
Emmett: If you kiss me,
I'll turn into a prince.

10:24.208 --> 10:26.500
Announcer: The Princess wasn't sure
what to do.

10:26.583 --> 10:28.083
No kidding.

10:29.041 --> 10:31.709
Announcer: But at last, she decided
to kiss the frog.

10:40.583 --> 10:41.709
Emmett?

10:43.125 --> 10:44.250
You're a prince.

10:44.500 --> 10:45.959
You finally noticed.

11:26.375 --> 11:27.875
I've never felt this way before.

11:28.542 --> 11:30.458
That's because you've been looking
at me like a frog

11:31.083 --> 11:33.250
when all along,
I've really been your prince.

11:43.625 --> 11:45.041
Whoa!

11:55.333 --> 11:58.750
I had the craziest dream last night.

12:00.959 --> 12:04.792
Well, I'd love to hear about it
while you help me fold the boys' undies.

12:06.834 --> 12:10.041
Uh, I, I, I dreamt that I kissed this guy

12:10.125 --> 12:11.834
and I fell instantly in love with him.

12:11.917 --> 12:15.667
A guy that I could never
possibly be in love with.

12:16.333 --> 12:18.792
Is it the guy who delivers our water?

12:21.291 --> 12:23.959
Okay. My, my dream, Mom. Not yours.

12:26.875 --> 12:27.750
Batman.

12:27.834 --> 12:28.917
Oh, the Lone Ranger.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.333
It was Emmett.

12:31.792 --> 12:32.834
Oh.

12:33.166 --> 12:36.959
Well, but... that's ridiculous, right?
I can't possibly be in love with Emmett.

12:37.041 --> 12:39.542
I've known him since we were kids
and he's always been super annoying.

12:40.417 --> 12:41.458
I don't know, Teddy.

12:41.542 --> 12:43.125
Life can be pretty funny.

12:44.458 --> 12:46.083
Yeah, but not that funny, right?

12:48.500 --> 12:50.375
Okay, I'm gonna tell you a little story.

12:52.166 --> 12:55.208
All through school, there was this
really annoying kid who liked me

12:55.291 --> 12:57.000
and I wanted nothing to do with him.

12:57.583 --> 12:59.583
Then, in high school
I agreed to go out with him.

13:00.375 --> 13:01.458
After a few dates,

13:01.875 --> 13:03.041
we kissed.

13:03.125 --> 13:05.291
And suddenly, everything changed.

13:05.834 --> 13:07.166
You know who that fellow was?

13:07.625 --> 13:08.959
Please say Batman.

13:12.875 --> 13:16.125
- It was your father.
- No! That's not what I wanted to hear.

13:16.208 --> 13:17.375
Well sorry,

13:17.917 --> 13:19.166
that's what happened.

13:19.458 --> 13:20.333
What, so...

13:20.417 --> 13:22.458
So, Emmett might be my true love?

13:22.834 --> 13:24.375
And future father of your four children.

13:24.458 --> 13:26.083
Aah!

13:32.166 --> 13:33.417
Something smells good.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.834
I'm making chili.
It'll be ready in a minute.

13:37.500 --> 13:38.417
Ah.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.083
Uh... That...

13:40.166 --> 13:41.208
That all the chili you made?

13:41.291 --> 13:42.166
Yeah.

13:42.250 --> 13:43.417
It's just the two of us, right?

13:43.500 --> 13:44.834
Well actually...

13:47.625 --> 13:48.750
It's the five of us.

13:50.667 --> 13:54.041
This is Billy, Joe, Barney,
and they are mighty hungry.

13:55.125 --> 13:56.041
Okay.

13:56.792 --> 13:57.667
Okay.

13:57.750 --> 13:59.625
Bobby, Jim, Barbie, could you excuse us?

14:01.375 --> 14:02.792
- Dad!
- What?

14:02.875 --> 14:06.333
So, I'm supposed to magically turn
chili for two into chili for five?

14:06.417 --> 14:07.375
Thank you.

14:09.542 --> 14:10.875
This is gonna take hours.

14:10.959 --> 14:13.041
And I have a book report due
on "Wuthering Heights."

14:16.959 --> 14:18.291
Anybody read "Wuthering Heights"?

14:19.542 --> 14:20.542
Anybody see the movie?

14:21.333 --> 14:22.458
Bob: Barney.

14:22.667 --> 14:25.333
You got a book report due.
I need five pages by dessert.

14:28.917 --> 14:30.000
Bob Duncan...

14:30.792 --> 14:33.041
you are so lucky I bought extra beans.

14:40.041 --> 14:42.583
I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. Flufferman.

14:44.458 --> 14:46.000
Yeah, about that...

14:46.083 --> 14:47.208
Got your email.

14:47.250 --> 14:49.041
Saw that you made some changes
to the script.

14:49.125 --> 14:50.250
- You're welcome.
- Danny: Yeah.

14:50.417 --> 14:52.208
Uh, actually we also made some changes...

14:52.417 --> 14:54.041
some casting changes.

14:54.500 --> 14:55.792
- What?
- Oh.

14:56.667 --> 14:57.709
Oh.

14:57.792 --> 14:59.041
Give me a minute.

15:00.750 --> 15:01.834
Gabe, honey...

15:03.083 --> 15:04.542
They're replacing you.

15:04.834 --> 15:06.166
Oh, no. No, no, no.

15:06.250 --> 15:07.375
No, uh...

15:07.458 --> 15:09.709
We're not replacing him.
We're replacing you.

15:09.792 --> 15:11.250
What? Me?

15:11.458 --> 15:13.542
Me?

15:13.625 --> 15:15.458
I'm the star of the commercial.

15:15.542 --> 15:17.875
Uh, you may be the star
of your commercial.

15:18.208 --> 15:20.375
He's the star of our commercial.

15:20.959 --> 15:23.041
Go easy on her, Danny. She means well.

15:24.417 --> 15:25.458
Well...

15:25.542 --> 15:28.250
Good luck finding someone
who can replace this.

15:28.959 --> 15:30.041
Um, hey.

15:30.917 --> 15:32.250
- You speak English?
- Yes.

15:32.583 --> 15:33.750
You've been replaced.

15:35.959 --> 15:36.875
Wow.

15:36.959 --> 15:39.000
You actually look more
like my mom than she does.

15:47.250 --> 15:48.250
Okay.

15:51.291 --> 15:52.375
Come on in.

15:52.458 --> 15:53.625
Is something wrong?

15:54.417 --> 15:55.792
Why would you think something's wrong?

15:55.875 --> 15:57.458
'Cause you called and invited me over.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.083
You've never done that before.

16:02.667 --> 16:03.917
Why don't you have a seat?

16:04.375 --> 16:06.041
Oh no, something is wrong.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.625
Okay. So, uh,

16:09.917 --> 16:11.083
here's the thing.

16:12.542 --> 16:14.583
I had a dream and...

16:15.208 --> 16:16.458
you were in it.

16:17.542 --> 16:19.250
And your glasses are fogging up so...

16:20.083 --> 16:22.125
Anyway, um in, in the dream,

16:23.792 --> 16:25.000
we kissed

16:26.125 --> 16:27.917
and it was a...

16:28.750 --> 16:29.917
good kiss.

16:30.041 --> 16:31.750
There go your glasses again.

16:33.542 --> 16:35.417
Anyway, I thought

16:35.500 --> 16:38.375
since we have to kiss in the show,

16:38.458 --> 16:41.083
maybe it might be a good idea
if we kiss here first.

16:42.125 --> 16:43.875
You know, like a... like a rehearsal.

16:43.959 --> 16:46.250
That way we can find out
if it means anything.

16:48.500 --> 16:49.709
What are you doing?

16:49.792 --> 16:50.750
Trying to say okay.

16:52.959 --> 16:53.792
All right, okay.

16:53.875 --> 16:55.750
Well, uh, let's get this over with then.

16:55.834 --> 16:57.250
I can't believe this is really happening.

16:57.375 --> 16:59.417
I've been dreaming about this
since I was nine years old.

16:59.500 --> 17:00.792
I'm really gonna kiss Teddy Duncan.

17:01.375 --> 17:02.667
And it's gonna be perfect.

17:04.667 --> 17:05.875
Here goes nothing.

17:09.375 --> 17:10.542
- Wait.
- What?

17:10.834 --> 17:11.959
What if it isn't?

17:12.417 --> 17:13.291
What if what isn't?

17:13.375 --> 17:14.709
The kiss. What if it isn't perfect?

17:14.792 --> 17:17.208
Well, then we'll know that there's nothing
between us.Now pucker up.

17:17.375 --> 17:18.500
No, Teddy.

17:18.583 --> 17:20.333
If the kiss isn't perfect,
I lose my dream.

17:20.709 --> 17:22.166
Less yackin', more smackin'.

17:22.250 --> 17:23.625
- Come on!
- No, no, no!

17:23.709 --> 17:25.583
I'm not gonna kiss you.

17:25.875 --> 17:27.542
Yes you are! I need to know.

17:27.625 --> 17:29.166
And I need to not know.

17:29.667 --> 17:31.250
- Kiss me!
- No! Leave me alone!

17:32.667 --> 17:34.166
Well, you're gonna have to
kiss me at work.

17:34.250 --> 17:35.542
- No I won't. I quit.
- Aah!

17:37.125 --> 17:39.208
Get back here and kiss me,
you little wimp!

17:41.125 --> 17:42.542
Hi, Mrs. Dabney.

17:48.166 --> 17:50.834
All right, Super Adventure Land
commercial take one.

17:50.917 --> 17:51.792
And...

17:51.917 --> 17:53.000
action!

17:54.667 --> 17:56.542
I love the new Super Adventure Land!

17:56.625 --> 17:58.792
The rides are faster
and the lines are shorter.

17:58.875 --> 18:00.792
The new Super Adventure Land is awesome.

18:00.875 --> 18:01.834
Cut!

18:03.208 --> 18:04.542
Uh...

18:04.917 --> 18:06.542
What, what are you doing?

18:07.166 --> 18:08.166
Walking.

18:08.250 --> 18:10.458
Okay. We said that you could be an extra.

18:10.542 --> 18:13.125
And that means you walk, all right?
And not in place.

18:13.208 --> 18:16.041
Okay, everybody back to one.
Let's go. From the top.

18:16.125 --> 18:17.208
Here we go.

18:18.000 --> 18:18.917
And...

18:19.875 --> 18:20.792
action.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.750
I love the new Super Adventure Land!

18:23.834 --> 18:26.000
The rides are faster
and the lines are shorter.

18:26.083 --> 18:28.250
The new Super Adventure Land is awesome.

18:28.333 --> 18:29.834
And safer too.

18:31.583 --> 18:32.583
Cut!

18:33.458 --> 18:34.792
What, what are you doing?

18:35.250 --> 18:37.792
I'm sorry. Um, did you not want me
to say that anymore?

18:38.333 --> 18:39.500
No, I didn't.

18:40.208 --> 18:42.250
Okay, well, you should
be more clear about that.

18:44.375 --> 18:45.458
One more time.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.917
Please, everybody, here we go.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.917
Okay. Not rocket science.

18:51.625 --> 18:52.542
And...

18:52.917 --> 18:54.041
action.

18:54.583 --> 18:56.375
I love the new Super Adventure Land!

18:56.750 --> 18:58.917
The rides are faster
and the lines are shorter.

18:59.250 --> 19:01.208
The new Super Adventure Land is awesome.

19:01.583 --> 19:02.792
And safer too.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.250
And how!

19:05.709 --> 19:07.125
Cut. Security.

19:07.542 --> 19:08.625
What?

19:08.709 --> 19:10.250
Guys, put me down.

19:10.333 --> 19:12.750
Ah, thank goodness that is over.

19:12.834 --> 19:14.500
It's gonna be a lot easier without her.

19:14.750 --> 19:16.000
And safer too.

19:21.750 --> 19:22.792
Great news.

19:23.375 --> 19:26.166
I am getting an "F" in "Trigometry."

19:26.250 --> 19:27.083
What?

19:27.166 --> 19:29.166
And I'm not doing so hot
in English either.

19:29.250 --> 19:31.583
Please tell Barney that
no one in "Wuthering Heights"

19:31.667 --> 19:32.959
carried a lightsaber.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.333
Oh, PJ, come on.

19:36.417 --> 19:39.041
Dad, I'm sorry,
but I can't cook for you anymore.

19:39.125 --> 19:41.709
My grades are suffering
and it's not healthy for you.

19:41.792 --> 19:43.875
How much weight have you put on
since I've been cooking?

19:44.000 --> 19:44.917
Two pounds.

19:45.000 --> 19:45.875
Dad?

19:45.959 --> 19:47.041
Nine pounds.

19:48.333 --> 19:49.875
We gotta get back to the way it was

19:49.959 --> 19:53.000
when you were slim
and I was getting solid "D"s.

19:57.291 --> 19:58.750
Yeah, I guess you're right.

20:04.542 --> 20:05.417
Charlie...

20:06.333 --> 20:07.625
can you cook for Daddy?

20:07.709 --> 20:08.583
No, Daddy.

20:18.959 --> 20:20.166
Oh hi.

20:20.250 --> 20:21.959
Hi. You must be the new frog.

20:22.041 --> 20:23.000
I'm the Princess.

20:24.875 --> 20:27.166
I just... I wanted to say hello
since we'll be working

20:27.250 --> 20:29.000
and kissing together.

20:32.041 --> 20:34.291
I'm so glad they brought
someone new in here.

20:34.375 --> 20:36.792
Things got kinda complicated
with the old frog.

20:36.875 --> 20:40.709
So, with you and me,
it's gonna be nice and simple.

20:42.792 --> 20:43.750
Hey, Teddy.

20:45.959 --> 20:47.125
Spencer?

20:48.250 --> 20:49.959
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

20:56.208 --> 20:57.208
Well, Charlie,

20:57.250 --> 20:59.250
it's been a strange week.

20:59.875 --> 21:02.542
Um, I had a dream
that my frog was a prince

21:02.625 --> 21:04.709
and then my ex-prince showed up as a frog

21:04.792 --> 21:07.000
and now I have to kiss him over and over.

21:08.041 --> 21:09.041
Stay tuned.

21:14.667 --> 21:16.250
Hey, mom, what you doin'?

21:17.959 --> 21:18.959
Just walking.

21:21.250 --> 21:22.291
In place?

21:22.834 --> 21:24.083
Don't you ever do that?

21:25.417 --> 21:26.500
Keep moving.

21:27.083 --> 21:28.166
Go on.

21:30.500 --> 21:31.500
Well, that's our mom.

21:31.834 --> 21:33.709
She sees a camera
and she can't help herself.

21:34.542 --> 21:35.750
Good luck, Charlie.

21:35.834 --> 21:37.208
And how.

21:44.542 --> 21:46.542
Hey, what is that thing?

21:47.083 --> 21:49.083
I bought it at the
Super Adventure Land gift shop.

21:49.166 --> 21:50.375
It's a time machine.

21:50.458 --> 21:52.250
Oh, for heaven's sakes, Bob.

21:52.667 --> 21:54.834
Why would you waste your money
on something as stupid as that?

21:54.917 --> 21:56.083
The guy said it works.

21:56.166 --> 21:59.291
Hey, you know what? I'm gonna set it back
for a couple of days ago.

22:04.750 --> 22:08.000
All right, everyone, here's the schedule
for today's trip to Super Adventure Land.

22:08.500 --> 22:10.250
I planned everything to the minute.

22:10.333 --> 22:13.333
Depart promptly at 8:57 A.M.,

22:13.417 --> 22:16.834
Both: "Arrive at SAL Parking lot,
9:33 A.M. "

22:17.083 --> 22:18.583
Oh my gosh.

22:18.875 --> 22:21.083
- Question.
- SAL stand for "Super Adventure Land."

22:21.166 --> 22:22.208
Thank you.

22:24.208 --> 22:25.041
It really works.

22:26.583 --> 22:29.375
- What are you doing?
- Setting this to before we had kids.

22:30.542 --> 22:31.583
Go, go!
