MEAN DECEASED.

THEY'RE THIRSTY,
BUT WHEN WE GIVE THEM WATER...

03:00.948 --> 03:03.884

YOU JUST MADE WALKING BOSS.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.366
- HELL WE GONNA FIND
WATER OUT HERE?

04:58.466 --> 05:01.068
- NEAREST RIVER'S
A FIVE-DAYS' RIDE WITH WAGONS.

05:01.168 --> 05:03.971
- WORKERS AIN'T
GONNA LAST THAT LONG.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.774
- DURANT'S GOT WATER
IN CHEYENNE.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.543
- HE AIN'T JUST GONNA
HAND IT OVER.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.379

HAVEN'T YOU, NATHAN?

05:17.951 --> 05:20.654

05:33.934 --> 05:36.404
THAT'S WHAT
WE EMPIRE BUILDERS DO.

05:36.504 --> 05:39.407

06:01.929 --> 06:03.997
AND THE COFFERS
NEED TO BE FILLED BY THEN,

06:04.097 --> 06:05.799

LOOKING AT THE WORLD

06:05.899 --> 06:08.869
FROM THE INSIDE OUT.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.838

I BROUGHT THE NEXT PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES

06:28.221 --> 06:30.591
OUT HERE
FOR YOUR GREAT PLAY, THOMAS,

06:30.691 --> 06:31.592
AND YOU FAILED.

06:31.692 --> 06:32.726
- I MADE YOU A FORTUNE!

06:32.826 --> 06:35.696
- AND IT COST ME
EVERYTHING.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.566
YOU AND YOUR PROMISES
ARE NOTHING BUT HOT AIR,

06:38.666 --> 06:40.768
LIKE THIS--
THIS STIFLING LITTLE ROOM,

06:40.868 --> 06:42.803
WHICH I PREDICT WILL BECOME
YOUR MAUSOLEUM.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.404

06:44.505 --> 06:46.840
COMING FROM SUCH
A FATUOUS ASS AS YOURSELF.

07:05.593 --> 07:06.994

THAT COULD HAVE--

07:07.094 --> 07:10.664
NO, SHOULD HAVE
BEEN YOURS

07:10.764 --> 07:13.701
WHEN HE COMPLETES
THE RAILROAD.

07:13.801 --> 07:17.471

09:07.114 --> 09:09.016
MUCH AS YOU'RE WILLING
TO SELL ME.

09:13.687 --> 09:18.759

IN THE MIDDLE OF THREE STREAMS.

09:18.859 --> 09:21.795
THOSE STREAMS
HAVE TURNED TO SAND.

WILL NEVER BE BUILT.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.957
LEAVE ME ALONE.

09:52.660 --> 09:55.996
- I'LL TAKE THAT WATER BY FORCE,
IF NEED BE.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.935

12:00.053 --> 12:02.790
[baby coos]

12:20.808 --> 12:25.278

12:59.479 --> 13:02.315
IT'S THE RIGHT DECISION.

13:02.415 --> 13:06.353

13:06.453 --> 13:09.256
- HOW DID YOU LEAVE IT
WITH MR. FERGUSON?

13:10.924 --> 13:12.893

NEVER CAME.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.428
MEN DYING BY THE DOZEN,
MR. BOHANNON,

13:48.528 --> 13:49.429

13:55.969 --> 13:57.204
COUPLE DAYS' RIDE.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.439
- MORMON RIDERS
COME THROUGH YESTERDAY.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.975
- THEM'S U.P. WAGONS
AND THEM'S U.P. HORSES.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.176
Y'ALL GET DOWN NOW.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.312

WE WON'T MAKE IT

14:05.412 --> 14:07.180
TO THE FORT ON FOOT
IN THIS HEAT.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.882
- YOU EITHER GET YOUR ASS
BACK IN THE CUT,

14:08.982 --> 14:10.083
OR YOU CAN HOOF IT
IN THE HEAT.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.452
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.056
- I AIN'T ASKING, DUTCH.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.125
[cocks gun]

14:18.225 --> 14:21.094

14:29.069 --> 14:30.337
WE AIN'T GONNA BE ABLE

14:30.437 --> 14:31.371
UNLESS WE GET WATER.

14:31.471 --> 14:32.973

ACCORDING TO THE SURVEYORS,

14:39.546 --> 14:41.448
THIS HERE
MIGHT BE A SPRING.

14:41.548 --> 14:45.919
- THAT'S 10 MILES OUT.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.055
AND IT LOOK LIKE JUST
A DROP OF INK.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.223
- IT'S GOTTA BE A SPRING.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.392
- HOPING IT'S A SPRING
DON'T MAKE IT A SPRING.

14:52.492 --> 14:55.495
AND HOW A SPRING 10 MILES OUT
GONNA GIVE US WATER HERE?

14:55.595 --> 14:57.230
- WE'LL PUMP IT UP
WITH A WINDMILL

14:57.330 --> 14:58.966
WE'LL BUILD IN PIECES
AND THEN WAGON TRAIN IT OUT.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.500

AND MILLERS WE GOT,

15:00.600 --> 15:02.602
KNOCK IT TOGETHER.
