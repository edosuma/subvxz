WEBVTT

00:34.200 --> 00:35.201
Want some syrup?

00:36.911 --> 00:37.746
Yes, please.

00:38.955 --> 00:40.999
Duncan's on his way down from Boston.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.668
So great to have him here
to help us get settled.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.256
Why is everyone so quiet today?

00:49.049 --> 00:49.966
We're not quiet.

00:50.925 --> 00:51.760
Okay.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.014
You don't remember seeing anything...

00:56.514 --> 00:57.891
unusual last night?

00:59.559 --> 01:01.728
You mean the mirror?
The one in Bode's room?

01:02.353 --> 01:03.188
Yeah.

01:03.521 --> 01:07.400
We'll get around to polishing it,
but...  it's way down on my list.

01:09.277 --> 01:11.780
That's the hardware store delivery.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.244
Okay. I've been thinking,

01:19.162 --> 01:20.997
and maybe what happened last night
didn't happen

01:21.122 --> 01:22.415
like we think it happened.

01:22.624 --> 01:23.458
Mold.

01:23.875 --> 01:27.087
This house is full of mold
and some mold makes people sick, Bode.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.797
It makes them hallucinate.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.800
It could explain
why Mom doesn't remember anything.

01:32.801 --> 01:36.096
The reason why she doesn't remember
is because she's a grown up.

01:36.554 --> 01:38.765
That's how this stuff always works.

01:39.015 --> 01:40.767
Only kids can get into Narnia.

01:40.850 --> 01:43.353
This isn't <i>The Lion, The Witch</i>
<i>and The "whatever,"</i> Bode.

01:43.436 --> 01:46.815
This is the real world,
where everything makes sense except you.

01:47.565 --> 01:48.399
Come here.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.202
Hey, Evil Kinsey reflection!

01:59.494 --> 02:02.163
Are you just a mold hallucination?

02:03.039 --> 02:03.998
Holy shit.

02:05.333 --> 02:06.668
You were saying?

02:11.631 --> 02:12.882
What the hell are you doing?

02:19.139 --> 02:19.973
Bode?

02:22.225 --> 02:23.810
Is this the only key you found?

02:24.185 --> 02:25.937
-Yes.

02:26.896 --> 02:29.357
Wait! What about the one
you took out of my bracelet?

02:29.440 --> 02:32.026
The one you said could take you
anywhere in the world?

02:32.944 --> 02:34.195
I lost it.

02:35.029 --> 02:38.158
You just lost a key
that could take you anywhere?

02:40.285 --> 02:41.411
You were so excited about it.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.204
-I don't get how you just lost it.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.123
Even more reason
not to trust him with this one.

02:45.206 --> 02:47.584
That's Javi.
If you want a ride, we got to go.

02:49.043 --> 02:51.462
-Please, please just be normal today.

02:52.088 --> 02:54.174
You find any keys, don't touch them.

03:01.055 --> 03:02.432
What was it like in there?

03:02.765 --> 03:04.851
-I don't know. It was...

03:05.101 --> 03:07.937
-like some kind of fun house from Hell.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.815
I can't believe
we're just going to school

03:10.899 --> 03:13.568
like nothing insane is going on.
Some of the girls back in Seattle

03:13.651 --> 03:16.029
used to take mental health days off
from school.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.406
How about a day
for processing the fact

03:18.489 --> 03:20.617
that we live in a frickin' magical house?

03:20.867 --> 03:22.660
-Do you think Dad knew about the keys?
-Please,

03:22.744 --> 03:23.703
just shut up about it.

03:23.786 --> 03:25.705
People think we're weird enough already.

03:26.748 --> 03:27.957
Don't make it worse.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.710
Hey, man.
This is my sister, Kinsey.

03:30.877 --> 03:31.920
- What up?
-Hey.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.880
This house is crazy.

03:34.005 --> 03:36.007
I've been hearing stories about it
since I was a kid.

03:36.132 --> 03:38.343
-Like what?

03:39.510 --> 03:40.428
Okay.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.973
So there's this one where this lady
just wandered in and she went nuts.

03:44.390 --> 03:47.560
All right, she's like a vegetable now.
Lives in an insane asylum.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.395
Sounds like total bullshit.

03:50.563 --> 03:51.689
-Could be.

03:52.649 --> 03:53.524
Who knows?

04:29.018 --> 04:32.105
I am seeing multiple points of entry,
Captain.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.774
Copy.
Let's stay on high alert.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.819
-Hey.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.196
Hot tip?

05:22.780 --> 05:25.658
That's the best toilet in the house.
Uncloggable!

05:26.784 --> 05:29.287
-Yeah, good to know.

05:33.082 --> 05:35.043
Permission to speak freely, sir?

05:35.793 --> 05:36.919
Go ahead.

05:37.211 --> 05:38.838
I'm starting to think...

05:39.756 --> 05:42.300
we may need some more powerful weapons.

07:01.546 --> 07:06.634
<i>♪ Now the sea eats the sky,</i>
<i>But they say it's a lie ♪</i>

07:06.884 --> 07:09.929
<i>-♪ There's no birds left to fly ♪</i>
<i>-</i>

07:10.054 --> 07:11.556
<i>-♪ We'll hide out ♪</i>
<i>-</i>

07:11.639 --> 07:13.224
-Dude, this is a...

07:13.307 --> 07:16.185
Yeah, I know. Pulled a hamstring
last week during practice.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.563
Doctor says I shouldn't push myself.

07:23.484 --> 07:24.652
What is her problem?

07:24.735 --> 07:26.571
She just came out that way.

07:29.031 --> 07:32.577
Here I am, being so chill
not asking you about last night.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.036
-Last night?
-How's your ankle, man?

07:34.120 --> 07:36.164
Oh, like you don't remember.
Hey, Brinker, what's up?

07:36.330 --> 07:38.082
Come on, you and Eden.

07:38.374 --> 07:39.876
What, this guy's been here like a day

07:39.959 --> 07:41.919
and he's already tapping
Matheson's finest.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.463
Yeah, I swear this was all me.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.548
For real,
I was like your ass guru, essentially.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.633
So. How was it?

07:50.261 --> 07:51.429
Uh...

07:52.388 --> 07:53.222
It was...

07:53.347 --> 07:55.224
Yeah, it was cool.
It was good.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.393
- Oh, yeah! Eden!

07:58.060 --> 07:59.312
Wow.

07:59.395 --> 08:01.439
Locke, stock and two smokin' titties!

08:02.190 --> 08:04.150
-You always take it too far, dude.
- Uh...

08:05.818 --> 08:06.652
What?

08:21.334 --> 08:22.335
Hi.

08:22.418 --> 08:23.336
Nina?

08:24.128 --> 08:25.463
I'm Ellie Whedon.

08:25.546 --> 08:28.216
My son Rufus has been taking care
of the grounds here.

08:28.799 --> 08:30.384
Yes. Hi.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.220
So nice to meet you.

08:32.303 --> 08:35.556
I brought you a little housewarming gift.
It's artisanal gin.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.392
It's made right here in Matheson
by the Wheeler sisters.

08:38.935 --> 08:41.521
They get a lot of tourists
at their distillery in the summer.

08:42.104 --> 08:43.773
Oh, uh-- Thank you.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.069
So, I hear your kids are going
to the academy.

08:48.152 --> 08:49.779
I teach there, Phys Ed.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.573
Part time so I can hang out with Rufus.

08:52.657 --> 08:53.491
Oh, that's great.

08:53.741 --> 08:55.284
Are you from here?

08:55.368 --> 08:56.202
I am.

08:56.285 --> 08:58.663
In fact, I went to the academy
with your husband.

09:00.831 --> 09:04.460
You know, I think
I found a photo of you yesterday.

09:08.297 --> 09:09.507
Wow.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.426
He's cute.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.680
Lucas was my boyfriend.

09:17.014 --> 09:18.516
Also Rendell's best friend.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.019
Rendell never mentioned him.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.234
Sorry.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.154
Hello?

09:32.280 --> 09:33.948
- <i>Is this Mrs. Locke?</i>
-Yes.

09:34.156 --> 09:36.409
<i>Hi, this is Bernadette</i>
<i>at the academy calling.</i>

09:36.659 --> 09:39.328
<i>We still haven't received</i>
<i>your tuition payment plan.</i>

09:39.620 --> 09:42.790
Okay, um... I'm sorry.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.126
Um...

09:46.043 --> 09:47.712
The form must have gotten lost

09:47.795 --> 09:48.629
in the shuffle.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.560
I should get going anyway.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.563
I'm really glad you're here, Nina.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.982
Thanks. It was really nice to meet you.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.373
I think I scared you.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.041
I didn't mean to scare you.

11:07.249 --> 11:08.542
That's okay.

11:09.627 --> 11:12.254
I saw you at the ice cream store
the other day.

11:13.297 --> 11:14.423
My name's Rufus.

11:14.965 --> 11:16.008
I'm adopted.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.218
I work here.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.803
I'm an excellent employee.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.931
Hi. I'm Bode. I live here.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.600
We've got the same GI Joes.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.853
Except yours has an M16.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.730
Mine's got an M60 machine gun.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.357
Wow.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.943
You sound like you're a weapons expert.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.820
I've never actually handled a gun.

11:35.903 --> 11:39.198
My mother says
I'm an agent of peace,

11:39.573 --> 11:41.992
but I do know all about weapons.

11:42.660 --> 11:43.494
So...

11:43.786 --> 11:47.123
what do you think is the best weapon
to use against an enemy

11:47.623 --> 11:51.419
who you're not even exactly sure
what it is?

11:59.051 --> 11:59.885
Come in here.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.555
- This should do it.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.849
If you need more traps,
I always leave the key ring

12:04.932 --> 12:06.851
in the top drawer by the stove,

12:06.934 --> 12:08.561
but you need to take care,

12:09.145 --> 12:13.482
or you could end up losing a hand,
or at least a few fingers.

12:18.028 --> 12:19.447
I could help if you want.

12:19.530 --> 12:22.575
No. I have to handle this myself

12:23.242 --> 12:25.536
I'm the reason she's out there.

12:25.619 --> 12:27.997
You'll probably want
to camouflage it, too.

12:28.330 --> 12:29.540
Unless your enemy's dumb.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.209
Yeah, she's not dumb.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.170
But the most important thing is bait.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.005
You got to ask yourself,

12:36.422 --> 12:39.133
what does my enemy most want?

12:41.343 --> 12:42.928
What does she want?

12:45.598 --> 12:49.018
<i>♪ You've been all alone ♪</i>

12:49.101 --> 12:52.730
<i>-♪ I've been gone on this road so long ♪</i>

12:54.023 --> 12:55.024
Okay.

12:55.107 --> 12:56.984
<i>♪ The same old silver moon ♪</i>

12:57.359 --> 13:00.112
<i>♪ Now I see what I got to do ♪</i>

13:02.239 --> 13:03.616
Wish I had your metabolism.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.954
<i>♪ Gone before the morning light ♪</i>

13:09.038 --> 13:12.917
<i>♪ To kiss your lips</i>
<i>When you open up your eyes ♪</i>

13:25.930 --> 13:27.681
Could you tell me where the restroom is?

13:27.765 --> 13:29.433
Sure. It's right through there.

13:29.934 --> 13:30.768
Great.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.041
-Alarm!

14:41.338 --> 14:42.214
Alarm!

15:12.077 --> 15:13.412
I want you to choke me.

15:18.751 --> 15:19.960
My turn.

15:23.589 --> 15:24.423
Too much.

15:26.550 --> 15:27.384
Hey.

15:29.845 --> 15:31.013
Stop.

15:32.514 --> 15:33.599
Let me go.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.061
Let me go.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.063
Let me go.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.071
Kinsey, hey.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.489
Hey, how's it going? I, um...

16:30.823 --> 16:33.492
Listen, I wanted to offer my apologies
for yesterday.

16:33.575 --> 16:34.952
I'm-- I'm terribly sorry.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.915
Okay, um...
Look, I know that didn't sound genuine

16:39.999 --> 16:41.500
and it's probably 'cause I'm English

16:41.583 --> 16:43.752
and so I have the emotional range
of a scone.

16:43.836 --> 16:44.878
A what?

16:44.962 --> 16:48.966
A scone. You know, the dry biscuity thing
that no one's ever very excited about?

16:49.049 --> 16:50.676
Oh. A scone.

16:51.260 --> 16:54.471
Right. See, even my pronunciation
feels repressed.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.765
But you know, with that being said,

16:56.849 --> 16:58.559
I really am sorry, Kinsey,

16:59.560 --> 17:01.687
and I hope that you can forgive me.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.607
I think you're a little too hard
on scones.

17:05.691 --> 17:06.859
- Hey,

17:06.942 --> 17:08.485
I am going to be a little bit late.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.112
I'm going to get my hair blown out.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.613
It's just how I see Amanda.

17:11.697 --> 17:12.948
-Okay, but--
- Hey,

17:13.032 --> 17:14.408
you can reimburse me.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.201
I'll see you later.

17:18.746 --> 17:19.580
Who's Amanda?

17:20.789 --> 17:22.041
She's my heroine.

17:22.124 --> 17:25.502
All the Savinis now,
we're making a cinematic <i>tour de </i>fear.

17:25.836 --> 17:28.005
It's a short film
we're calling <i>The Splattering.</i>

17:28.088 --> 17:28.922
Wow.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.050
Which I maintain should be called
<i>The Spattering</i>

17:31.133 --> 17:34.094
because it is in fact blood spatter,
and not blood splatter,

17:34.178 --> 17:38.098
but the Savinis maintain
that no one actually cares, so...

17:38.807 --> 17:39.641
splattering.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.101
Anyway, Eden's playing the lead.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.562
-Eden?
-Yeah, she's actually pretty talented

17:43.645 --> 17:45.522
when she's not draining the life force
out of me.

17:48.525 --> 17:51.987
Hey, if, I mean, if you want,
you could join us on set

17:52.071 --> 17:54.073
and maybe I could apologize properly?

17:54.323 --> 17:55.866
I'm making smoothies, so...

17:56.283 --> 17:57.159
And I promise

17:57.242 --> 17:59.286
there won't be anything
actually scary there,

17:59.745 --> 18:03.665
besides Eden's monstrous ego,
of course.

18:08.670 --> 18:09.922
Thank you.

18:11.965 --> 18:12.800
Excuse me.

18:12.883 --> 18:15.469
-Are you Mrs. Locke?
-Yes.

18:15.552 --> 18:17.346
I'm Joe-- Do you mind?

18:20.140 --> 18:20.974
Hi.

18:21.141 --> 18:23.560
I'm Joe Ridgeway. Dean of 11th grade.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.979
Your son Tyler is in my English class.

18:26.855 --> 18:27.689
Oh, wow.

18:27.940 --> 18:28.899
How's he doing?

18:28.982 --> 18:31.485
Well, it's only been two days,
and I usually wait

18:31.652 --> 18:32.945
until at least day three

18:33.028 --> 18:36.615
before I make any big judgments
about my students' character.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.408
-I see.

18:38.575 --> 18:40.869
I can already tell that he's a bright kid.

18:41.745 --> 18:43.330
He's just quiet, that's all.

18:44.581 --> 18:45.415
Right.

18:46.834 --> 18:50.295
-Well, you know, we've had quite a--
-I do know.

18:51.171 --> 18:52.881
And I'm going to look out for him.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.216
You have my word.

18:55.425 --> 18:57.594
-Thank you.
-You know, it's uncanny,

18:58.262 --> 19:00.347
the way he reminds me of his father.

19:01.515 --> 19:03.142
-You know Rendell?
-Oh, very well.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.893
I was his teacher, too.

19:04.977 --> 19:05.978
Really?

19:06.270 --> 19:08.105
So you taught Ellie

19:08.188 --> 19:10.107
and Lucas
and all those other kids?

19:10.190 --> 19:14.027
That I did. Wow. Such a tight knit crew.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.239
Rendell always said
that he was a loner as a kid.

19:17.948 --> 19:19.783
Hmm. Yeah, well...

19:19.867 --> 19:21.743
maybe he was when he was younger,

19:21.827 --> 19:24.246
but after a certain point,
he and those friends of his

19:24.329 --> 19:26.331
were always together,

19:26.456 --> 19:27.583
cooking things up,

19:28.333 --> 19:29.793
but they were all good kids.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.797
Such a tragedy what happened to them.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.596
Oh,  he never talked about them?

19:42.347 --> 19:43.182
Huh.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.058
-Not at all?

19:46.727 --> 19:47.853
Mrs. Locke,

19:47.936 --> 19:49.605
I just need one more signature from you.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.899
Oh, and I better be going.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.233
I got a class in a few minutes.

19:53.775 --> 19:55.402
Listen, it was wonderful to meet you.

19:55.485 --> 19:56.695
-You, too.
-All right.

19:56.778 --> 19:58.780
-I'll see you soon.
-Yes, I hope so.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.714
-Hey.
-Hi.

20:16.256 --> 20:17.966
Are you here to sign up?

20:18.175 --> 20:19.134
Uh...

20:19.426 --> 20:21.762
No, I'm not.
I'm not really a big activities guy.

20:21.845 --> 20:23.722
So, then why are you here?

20:24.973 --> 20:27.017
I wanted to let you know that nothing...

20:28.018 --> 20:29.686
happened between me and Eden.

20:30.854 --> 20:32.481
You think I don't already know that?

20:33.232 --> 20:34.358
Eden's my friend.

20:34.858 --> 20:36.068
She told me everything.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.321
I actually thought you were a decent guy

20:39.947 --> 20:41.031
until this morning.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.953
So, you don't need
to set the record straight with me...

20:47.746 --> 20:51.500
but maybe instead you can go tell Javi
and Brinker what really happened.

20:55.462 --> 20:56.380
No?

20:57.256 --> 20:58.382
Not interested?

20:59.841 --> 21:00.676
You know,

21:00.842 --> 21:02.177
you can either be an asshole

21:02.844 --> 21:03.971
or a good guy, Tyler.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.349
You can't be both.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.145
Hey, you here to sign up?

21:12.229 --> 21:13.272
-Yup.
-Cool.

21:13.772 --> 21:16.149
I just need your name
and your homeroom. There.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.494
Come sit down with me for a second.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.830
Can you make it quick?
I've got hockey practice.

21:34.793 --> 21:38.463
Tell me what you know about Sam Lesser.

21:39.631 --> 21:42.634
I don't know. He's pretty weird, I guess.

21:42.884 --> 21:44.011
Doesn't...

21:44.678 --> 21:46.471
seem to have a lot of friends?

21:47.848 --> 21:49.474
No, I guess not.

21:50.183 --> 21:51.018
Why?

21:51.518 --> 21:54.688
I was hoping that maybe
you could reach out to him.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.274
He could really use the extra support.

21:58.442 --> 21:59.818
-Is there a problem?
-Yeah.

21:59.901 --> 22:02.946
Dad, my friends already give me
enough shit as it is.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.656
They call me the guidance counselor.

22:04.740 --> 22:05.741
Ouch.

22:05.824 --> 22:07.534
I'm just saying,

22:07.617 --> 22:08.952
if I start dragging Sam around

22:09.036 --> 22:11.496
like here's my freaky little pet,
they are gonna--

22:11.580 --> 22:12.748
What? The world is gonna end?

22:14.416 --> 22:15.667
Come on, give me a break.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.378
You've got a lot of social power.
I've seen it,

22:18.462 --> 22:20.172
and now I'm just asking you to use it.

22:20.255 --> 22:21.631
-Dad, please.
-Actually...

22:22.841 --> 22:23.842
I'm not asking.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.348
- Tyler!

22:36.104 --> 22:37.773
-I didn't mean to spy on you.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.692
I just-- I think it's great
that you're signing up for more stuff.

22:41.318 --> 22:44.279
Maybe you can work on the newspaper,
the debate team or something--

22:44.363 --> 22:45.906
Just give me a break, all right?

22:45.989 --> 22:48.533
It's been two days.
I barely know my way to class.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.036
I know, I'm sorry. I just...

22:52.746 --> 22:55.082
I just want you guys to find
some happiness here.

22:56.666 --> 22:57.501
I know.

22:58.919 --> 23:02.339
Keep an eye out for Kinsey, okay?
She doesn't make friends as easily as you.

23:03.340 --> 23:04.341
See you at dinner.

23:47.467 --> 23:48.885
Say hi to your wife for me.

23:51.221 --> 23:52.472
Help you with something?

23:53.390 --> 23:54.474
Um, yeah.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.727
Do you sell any keys that look like this?

24:00.647 --> 24:02.607
Now, that's a really cool one.

24:03.316 --> 24:04.693
I think it's maybe...

24:05.110 --> 24:06.319
17th century.

24:06.820 --> 24:07.821
Do you mind?

24:10.949 --> 24:11.783
Wow.

24:12.826 --> 24:15.078
Well,
that's lighter than any iron I've felt.

24:16.663 --> 24:18.039
Where did this come from?

24:19.624 --> 24:20.959
I'm not sure.

24:22.752 --> 24:24.713
Well, let me see what I've got here.

24:43.023 --> 24:45.317
Hmm.

24:47.444 --> 24:48.528
-Here.

24:49.112 --> 24:51.072
These don't seem to be worth much
to anybody,

24:51.156 --> 24:52.616
including me.

24:53.241 --> 24:54.367
Go ahead, take 'em.

24:55.410 --> 24:56.244
Thank you.

25:18.016 --> 25:20.018
- Kinsey!

25:20.477 --> 25:21.686
- I was hoping

25:21.770 --> 25:23.230
your dad would answer some questions,

25:23.313 --> 25:25.148
-but he wasn't any help.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.525
Will you help me, Kinsey?

25:27.526 --> 25:28.610
Last chance, Kinsey.

26:08.650 --> 26:09.484
Hey.

26:11.278 --> 26:12.237
How's it going?

26:12.320 --> 26:15.156
Well, my brother left me high and dry
in a sea of strangers, so...

26:15.240 --> 26:16.324
What are you, ten?

26:18.034 --> 26:18.952
Look...

26:21.246 --> 26:22.247
I'm sorry.

26:26.084 --> 26:29.254
I'm just trying to make it through the day
without going crazy.

26:30.088 --> 26:30.964
Seriously.

26:33.300 --> 26:34.259
Yeah, me too.

26:37.345 --> 26:38.305
Tyler?

26:39.514 --> 26:40.849
-Hello!

26:42.142 --> 26:44.019
I'm sorry. Javi's waiting for me.

26:44.352 --> 26:45.353
I should go.

26:52.652 --> 26:53.778
Sorry, I'm a little early.

26:53.862 --> 26:54.821
Oh, no worries.

26:54.904 --> 26:57.991
Rufus is just out with the snowblower,
blowing us a back path.

26:58.074 --> 26:59.784
-I'll go grab him.
-No, I can wait.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.911
He doesn't like to leave
until everything's done.

27:02.621 --> 27:03.955
Actually, I'm...

27:04.623 --> 27:06.124
glad that we have some time.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.460
There's something I want to ask you about.

27:08.543 --> 27:10.045
You want some tea?

27:13.340 --> 27:17.135
When I was talking to the English teacher,
Joe Ridgeway,

27:18.053 --> 27:22.974
um, he made a reference to something,
some kind of... tragedy.

27:24.434 --> 27:25.894
What was he talking about?

27:32.317 --> 27:33.151
At the, uh...

27:33.318 --> 27:34.861
the end of our senior year...

27:36.738 --> 27:38.156
there was an accident.

27:40.033 --> 27:41.493
Three of our friends drowned.

27:43.620 --> 27:44.746
Oh, my God.

27:47.415 --> 27:48.458
Where?

27:48.708 --> 27:50.377
-In the sea cave.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.588
It's about a half mile north of here.

27:56.633 --> 27:59.094
We had all just graduated and we were...

28:00.387 --> 28:01.388
partying and...

28:02.972 --> 28:04.683
not thinking about the tides.

28:05.225 --> 28:06.476
I'm so sorry.

28:07.936 --> 28:10.146
Why wouldn't Rendell have told me
about this?

28:12.816 --> 28:14.859
Maybe he just didn't want to revisit it.

28:17.028 --> 28:20.782
It was the most painful thing
that had ever happened to any of us.

28:21.199 --> 28:24.202
I mean,
I never talk about it myself.

28:26.621 --> 28:27.455
Lucas...

28:31.126 --> 28:32.836
I mean, I know most people think,

28:33.628 --> 28:36.673
high school romances,
who cares? But...

28:39.843 --> 28:41.302
he was something special.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.358
Let's put this key in it.

30:38.294 --> 30:41.089
Stop with the drama, bro.
It's just a scratch.

30:43.258 --> 30:44.217
Hey, Logan.

30:45.134 --> 30:46.052
What's up?

30:46.177 --> 30:47.971
- Something wrong?
- Yeah.

30:48.054 --> 30:50.098
Some garbage person keyed my car
for no reason.

30:50.181 --> 30:51.182
No shit!

30:51.683 --> 30:52.684
Ah, that sucks.

30:53.268 --> 30:55.562
-Have any idea who might have done it?
- No.

30:55.645 --> 30:57.146
No one saw the piece of shit.

30:59.357 --> 31:00.900
-Tough break, man.

31:00.984 --> 31:02.694
Hey... Hey.

31:03.278 --> 31:05.864
I should get home.
My little brother is kinda--

31:05.947 --> 31:06.990
Oh, no way, bro.

31:07.073 --> 31:09.701
I'm mourning the loss of my paint job.
We need to drink.

31:09.784 --> 31:11.828
-No, seriously--
-See you later, Logan.

31:12.954 --> 31:13.997
What are you doing?

31:14.080 --> 31:16.207
- Hey.
-Dude, it's fine. We do this all the time.

31:16.291 --> 31:19.085
Bro, just tuck it under your arm
and follow our lead. Let's go.

31:22.338 --> 31:23.923
What do you think you're doing?

31:29.721 --> 31:32.056
-Are you okay?

31:33.433 --> 31:34.809
Look, I, um...

31:35.894 --> 31:36.811
I don't even want this.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.021
Can you please just...

31:38.104 --> 31:39.022
take it back?

31:39.522 --> 31:40.899
Not how it works, kid.

31:41.816 --> 31:43.067
-Please, I just--
- Hey.

31:43.151 --> 31:46.404
I was wondering where you went.
I just went to the bathroom for a second,

31:46.988 --> 31:49.782
which isn't the most accessible bathroom
I've ever been in.

31:49.866 --> 31:51.367
Thanks for holding my beer for me, man.

31:52.243 --> 31:53.077
ID?

31:58.458 --> 31:59.542
You even know this kid?

32:00.126 --> 32:01.294
Yeah, that's Tyler Locke.

32:01.419 --> 32:03.838
You heard of the Lockes, right?
They just moved into Key House.

32:04.255 --> 32:06.257
Oh. Right. Yeah.

32:07.425 --> 32:08.885
My condolences.

32:11.137 --> 32:12.305
Keep the change, man.

32:13.431 --> 32:14.641
See you around, Tyler.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.012
Bode, hi.

32:53.846 --> 32:55.390
-Did you miss me?

32:55.473 --> 32:57.392
I had a really wonderful day
because of you.

32:58.059 --> 32:59.310
It was so fun.

32:59.394 --> 33:00.311
I even won you--

33:02.814 --> 33:04.482
My gosh.

33:07.485 --> 33:08.319
What...

33:09.529 --> 33:10.905
did you find?

33:23.376 --> 33:24.293
Bode.

33:25.837 --> 33:30.091
Did you think you could trap me
and then make me give you back the key?

33:31.718 --> 33:33.052
I thought we were friends.

33:33.428 --> 33:34.762
We're not friends.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.850
You lied to me
and you tried to kill my mom.

33:40.435 --> 33:41.769
What other keys have you found?

33:41.853 --> 33:43.354
I haven't found any more.

33:43.938 --> 33:44.856
Well...

33:45.815 --> 33:48.443
maybe you need to try harder

33:48.818 --> 33:51.821
and when you find them,
you're going to give them back to me.

33:51.946 --> 33:53.906
- And why would I do that?

33:55.116 --> 33:56.367
Because when I come back,

33:56.451 --> 33:58.911
-I'm going to be so nice.

34:05.293 --> 34:08.671
-Happy hunting, Bode.

34:21.184 --> 34:22.018
Duct tape.

34:23.686 --> 34:24.604
Thanks.

34:36.491 --> 34:37.408
What's up? I'm Gabe.

34:40.328 --> 34:41.245
Craft service?

34:41.996 --> 34:44.624
Oh, yeah, sorry.
Gabe is new to Matheson, too.

34:44.707 --> 34:46.709
Yeah, we were on a frantic search
for our monster

34:46.793 --> 34:49.879
so we offered him friendship in exchange
for wearing a suit that doesn't breathe.

34:49.962 --> 34:51.881
-It does not smell awesome in here.

34:51.964 --> 34:53.299
So, what exactly are you?

34:53.382 --> 34:55.218
Wait, you mean
you've never heard of Amphropeta?

34:55.301 --> 34:57.303
-It's like a local legend.
- Half man,

34:57.386 --> 35:00.056
half lobster, fully ticked off about
how we persecute his brethren

35:00.139 --> 35:01.307
in the deep.

35:01.766 --> 35:04.060
Every now and then
he'll snatch up a fisherman or a whaler.

35:04.143 --> 35:05.603
Or teenagers dry humping
on the beach.

35:05.686 --> 35:07.897
He's probably untethered the soul
of one of your ancestors

35:07.980 --> 35:08.940
with a mighty...

35:09.023 --> 35:10.483
-snap of the claw.

35:12.026 --> 35:12.860
Sorry.

35:13.444 --> 35:14.612
I forgive you.

35:14.695 --> 35:16.030
Practical effects will be mental.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.074
Zadie's been working on this application
for weeks.

35:18.157 --> 35:19.033
When Gabe attacks,

35:19.117 --> 35:20.910
I'm gonna make the head pop off
into the air

35:20.993 --> 35:23.412
and the blood's going to spurt up
this tube and all over Eden.

35:23.496 --> 35:25.414
Okay, sorry wait.

35:25.498 --> 35:27.625
I didn't think
I was gonna get blood all over me.

35:27.708 --> 35:29.293
It's in the script.

35:31.462 --> 35:32.839
"Blood erupts from Nathaniel's neck

35:32.922 --> 35:34.966
like a geyser and rains down
in a grisly torrent

35:35.049 --> 35:37.301
on Amanda as she screams."

35:37.385 --> 35:40.138
But I didn't think you were actually going
to drown me in blood.

35:40.221 --> 35:41.889
It's corn syrup and food coloring.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.891
It's fully edible and washable.

35:43.975 --> 35:47.228
But I don't understand
why we can't just do it without the blood.

35:47.311 --> 35:49.939
Because we got the couch from Goodwill

35:50.022 --> 35:51.274
and you're aware, Eden,

35:51.357 --> 35:53.693
that the title of the movie is
<i>The Splattering.</i>

35:54.443 --> 35:56.154
Well, then it's me or the blood.

35:56.237 --> 35:57.446
Blood. I vote blood.

35:57.530 --> 35:58.906
I mean, obviously.

36:04.245 --> 36:05.830
Oh, I get a vote?

36:05.913 --> 36:06.747
Um...

36:06.831 --> 36:08.457
Yeah, I'll say blood, too.

36:08.916 --> 36:10.501
The ayes have it, Eden.

36:11.544 --> 36:12.461
I'm out of here.

36:16.549 --> 36:18.009
Bye. Love you.

36:19.844 --> 36:22.221
Well, you guys just destroyed
your own film.

36:27.560 --> 36:28.811
-So what now?

36:28.895 --> 36:30.646
Well, I don't know, Doug. Pitch me a fix.

36:31.314 --> 36:32.148
Well,

36:32.440 --> 36:33.816
maybe Kinsey could do it.

36:33.900 --> 36:36.527
Oh, no, no...
I don't think that's a good idea.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.362
Um...

36:38.487 --> 36:41.199
I don't think Kinsey's wheelhouse
is in line with this

36:41.282 --> 36:43.534
particular brand of cinematic methodology.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.038
No, I can do it.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.499
Really? Y-Yeah?

36:50.583 --> 36:52.585
Yeah, sure.

36:53.836 --> 36:56.380
But I was told
there would be smoothies.

36:59.550 --> 37:02.345
-So, you are Amanda

37:02.428 --> 37:05.932
and you just started in the early stages
of your new relationship with Nathaniel,

37:06.015 --> 37:06.974
who in the other scenes

37:07.058 --> 37:08.601
will be played by yours truly.

37:08.684 --> 37:10.728
Wow, you're an actor, too?

37:10.811 --> 37:12.688
-I mean...
-Actor is a stretch.

37:12.772 --> 37:14.523
Douglas, please with the chit chat.

37:14.607 --> 37:15.608
I'm working with my lead.

37:15.691 --> 37:16.525
Anyway,

37:17.235 --> 37:19.737
so... you're about to sit down
and watch a movie

37:19.820 --> 37:21.072
and perhaps let things progress

37:21.155 --> 37:22.698
-to the next proverbial base.

37:22.782 --> 37:24.617
You're excited, but you're nervous.

37:24.784 --> 37:26.953
You're full of desire,
but you've got a complicated past.

37:27.703 --> 37:28.913
Make sense?

37:28.996 --> 37:30.706
-I think so.
-Great.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.375
And just so you know,

37:32.458 --> 37:34.377
we really only have one shot at this,
so...

37:35.419 --> 37:36.921
Okay, let's go. And...

37:37.922 --> 37:40.341
places, people! Places!

37:40.925 --> 37:42.677
- And roll sound, Doug.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.720
Sound is sounding.

37:44.804 --> 37:45.972
-Zadie, slate.

37:47.056 --> 37:48.516
<i>The Splattering, </i>scene 23,

37:48.599 --> 37:49.600
-take one.

37:49.725 --> 37:50.559
Mark.

37:51.227 --> 37:52.270
It's go time.

37:52.895 --> 37:54.897
And... action.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.442
Nathaniel.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.945
I can't believe you started the movie
without me.

38:01.445 --> 38:04.573
I hope I didn't put too much butter
on the popcorn.

38:04.699 --> 38:05.908
No such thing.

38:08.286 --> 38:09.245
And, Gabe.

38:14.834 --> 38:16.669
-Okay. In three...

38:17.545 --> 38:18.921
two... one!

38:23.426 --> 38:24.927
Okay, now, now Kinsey, scream.

38:25.011 --> 38:27.179
- Kinsey...

38:27.305 --> 38:28.306
Kinsey,

38:28.389 --> 38:29.390
Kinsey, scream.

38:30.349 --> 38:31.767
- Kinsey...

38:31.851 --> 38:32.685
Kinsey,

38:32.768 --> 38:33.811
do something.

38:34.395 --> 38:35.688
- Kinsey!

38:36.105 --> 38:38.024
Cut. Cut. Cut.

38:38.107 --> 38:39.817
- Cutting.

38:44.447 --> 38:45.489
I'm sorry.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.827
Hey, well, no, hey, it's...
it's all right.

38:49.910 --> 38:51.287
It's okay. It's, um...

38:51.746 --> 38:52.913
Don't worry about it.

38:53.497 --> 38:56.208
This... this blood is too red.

38:56.292 --> 38:57.877
We're going to have to reshoot anyway,

38:57.960 --> 38:59.420
so it's... Right, guys?

39:00.421 --> 39:02.214
Yeah. Maybe we can fix it in post.

39:02.298 --> 39:05.176
Doug Prazila,
you did not just say that to me.

39:08.054 --> 39:10.514
-Thanks for your help today.

39:11.932 --> 39:14.602
Sorry Kinsey and Tyler couldn't make it
to dinner.

39:15.061 --> 39:16.270
Oh, don't sweat it.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.646
They're teenagering.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.316
It just means more moo shu pork
for us, right?

39:24.779 --> 39:25.696
Duncan...

39:27.656 --> 39:29.325
why do you think Rendell

39:30.242 --> 39:31.952
never told me about that drowning?

39:32.953 --> 39:33.788
What drowning?

39:36.665 --> 39:38.876
Rendell's friends. His best friend, Lucas.

39:39.460 --> 39:40.586
Right, yeah... Um...

39:41.754 --> 39:42.797
I must not have...

39:46.092 --> 39:47.301
I don't really remember.

39:48.844 --> 39:50.221
What are you talking about?

39:51.931 --> 39:53.599
You lived here
when it happened.

39:55.142 --> 39:56.977
It must have been totally traumatic.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.647
Yeah, it probably was for Rendell.

40:00.564 --> 40:03.234
But... you're his brother

40:03.317 --> 40:06.028
and they were his closest friends and...

40:06.737 --> 40:07.780
they died.

40:10.032 --> 40:12.284
I don't understand
how you wouldn't remember that.

40:12.368 --> 40:14.745
Look... Rendell was a lot older than me.

40:14.829 --> 40:16.789
He and his friends,
they mostly kept to themselves.

40:16.872 --> 40:18.040
So they probably just...

40:27.174 --> 40:29.176
Honestly, I don't know
why I don't remember.

40:31.637 --> 40:33.264
It's like that whole time period
is just...

40:33.681 --> 40:34.515
rubbed out.

40:38.144 --> 40:39.687
I don't really understand it.

40:44.650 --> 40:47.361
It's probably why I don't like
spending a lot of time down here.

40:54.743 --> 40:57.621
Did Rendell ever mention Sam Lesser
to you?

40:58.080 --> 40:59.373
-No, why?

41:02.376 --> 41:03.210
Hey!

41:04.128 --> 41:05.212
Kinsey, just in time.

41:05.296 --> 41:06.547
Well, the chow mein's kicked,

41:06.630 --> 41:08.424
but there's still some spring rolls.

41:08.507 --> 41:09.383
Jesus!

41:09.467 --> 41:11.802
- What the hell happened?
-It's fine. It's fake blood.

41:12.928 --> 41:13.971
Edible and washable.

41:15.723 --> 41:16.849
I'm going to clean up.

41:46.045 --> 41:47.213
I got you a present.

41:47.296 --> 41:49.131
You didn't have to get me anything.

41:49.340 --> 41:51.425
You only graduate middle school once...

41:52.134 --> 41:53.636
if you're doing it right.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.768
-This is so cool.

42:01.227 --> 42:04.021
I've been holding on to that
for a long time.

42:05.731 --> 42:06.607
I think...

42:07.691 --> 42:08.984
you're old enough to wear it now.

42:09.276 --> 42:13.948
It's kind of a family heirloom.

42:16.325 --> 42:17.409
Thanks, Dad.

42:17.535 --> 42:18.953
-I love it.

42:19.870 --> 42:23.082
It's always been special to me.
I know you'll take good care of it.

42:25.167 --> 42:27.002
You never talk about your family.

42:27.086 --> 42:29.296
We just...

42:30.297 --> 42:32.633
We just went in different directions.

42:35.135 --> 42:37.012
Now you guys are all the family I need.

42:40.599 --> 42:42.726
You're so much more than I ever deserved.

42:44.853 --> 42:45.938
Just stick together,

42:46.397 --> 42:47.565
you and your brothers.

42:48.941 --> 42:49.858
Yeah.

42:52.236 --> 42:53.070
Hey.

42:53.779 --> 42:55.823
I'm so proud of you.

44:53.482 --> 44:55.025
Wow...

45:02.825 --> 45:04.368
I covered for you with Mom.

45:10.499 --> 45:12.710
Said you were in the school library,
studying.

45:14.378 --> 45:15.629
Thanks.

45:16.213 --> 45:17.297
Yeah, you're welcome.

45:22.010 --> 45:23.303
What do you want from me, Kinsey?

45:23.387 --> 45:25.973
I'd be an idiot to want anything
from you, Tyler,

45:26.056 --> 45:27.808
especially when you're in this state.

45:28.434 --> 45:29.935
Don't tell me about my state, okay?

45:30.018 --> 45:32.229
-Just... I'm tired.
-You used to talk to me,

45:32.730 --> 45:33.731
about everything,

45:34.148 --> 45:35.983
about nothing. But now that I...

45:39.695 --> 45:41.321
Now that real shit's going on...

45:44.533 --> 45:46.285
I don't even recognize you anymore.

45:47.745 --> 45:49.413
It's starting to scare me.

45:51.039 --> 45:52.583
I'm the same as I always was.

45:55.335 --> 45:56.962
No, you're not. You're...

46:02.384 --> 46:03.302
Bode?

46:20.819 --> 46:21.653
Bode?

46:32.956 --> 46:33.832
Bode!

46:33.916 --> 46:36.502
-Hey, guys! You gotta come see this!

46:37.836 --> 46:38.796
Follow me!

46:45.344 --> 46:46.178
