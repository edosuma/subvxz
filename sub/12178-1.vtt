01:55.067 --> 01:59.209
'Laila O Laila'

06:43.733 --> 06:45.371
Greetings doctor
MBRHDRG

07:05.300 --> 07:07.246
- Park the car
- Okay

07:30.333 --> 07:34.577
- Vijayan, what happened?
- Priya, flat is locked

07:34.633 --> 07:37.375
I enquired with all the neighbouring
flat people about Jai Mohan

07:37.467 --> 07:39.310
No one knows anything about him

07:39.400 --> 07:40.970
One minute
I'll come just now

07:41.067 --> 07:43.741
The surprising thing is that
not even the next neighbour...

07:43.800 --> 07:46.076
...has been informed
about the marriage

07:49.133 --> 07:51.204
The flat is locked
No one is there

07:54.567 --> 07:56.547
- What happened, Priya?
- He is not in the flat

07:56.633 --> 07:58.408
I got Vijayan to enquire in the flat

07:59.000 --> 08:01.002
When he asked
the neighbouring flat lady...

08:01.067 --> 08:03.206
...they don't even know
about such a marriage

08:03.300 --> 08:07.043
Watchman saw him going
out late in the night

08:08.300 --> 08:10.211
Did you call him?

08:10.333 --> 08:13.473
It is switched off
or else not reachable

08:14.167 --> 08:18.206
- I don't know, Priya
- May be some accident-

08:18.333 --> 08:22.543
In that case someone next to
him is sure to pick up the call

08:23.467 --> 08:25.242
You try to contact one more time

08:37.000 --> 08:40.971
'The number you have
called is currently switched off'

08:42.500 --> 08:47.210
Dear, did this Jai Mohan of yours
duck out at the last moment?

08:47.333 --> 08:53.147
No, my Jai is not
that type of a person

09:49.067 --> 09:51.479
Listen! I didn't order anything
Do you understand?

12:10.200 --> 12:14.546
Bad! Now also you
expect him to arrive, isn't it?

12:20.200 --> 12:24.273
If there had been any marks on
my face, I would have torn...

12:24.367 --> 12:26.608
...your face to pieces and grinded it

12:46.500 --> 12:48.446
After bath he is taking rest

13:05.167 --> 13:08.171
Seize all the belongings in the room

13:15.500 --> 13:19.243
Go and get ready soon
You are getting late for marriage

13:23.267 --> 13:27.147
Dr Menon pampered and
spoilt his only daughter

13:27.200 --> 13:30.238
I agreed to whatever you asked
Including this marriage

13:30.333 --> 13:33.246
That is how everyone is
making fun of this daddy

13:33.800 --> 13:37.213
You selected him yourself
It was not that I liked him

13:37.600 --> 13:39.773
But I thought let
your wish get fulfilled

13:41.200 --> 13:42.975
I also had choices!

13:43.067 --> 13:46.537
To run my chain of hospitals
a capable doctor

13:46.633 --> 13:49.705
Or else a business man who
has the capacity to run that

13:49.800 --> 13:54.249
But my daughter's
choice was Jai Mohan

13:54.600 --> 13:56.602
For whom it is
a second marriage

13:56.700 --> 13:58.179
A divorcee

13:59.433 --> 14:01.709
No family and friends

14:02.767 --> 14:04.713
On asking about his occupation...

14:04.800 --> 14:08.338
...in a lousy exporting company
he is an executive manager

14:09.667 --> 14:13.376
I always felt that you
are making a mistake

14:14.700 --> 14:18.580
Yes, a very big mistake
Again the same mistake

14:18.667 --> 14:20.340
Now you have repeated it

14:20.700 --> 14:24.443
I was felt happy when your first wife
took divorce from you...

14:24.533 --> 14:26.604
...within 6 months of
the marriage and left you

14:26.800 --> 14:32.182
I was that much happy
Jai, marriage won't work for you

14:32.233 --> 14:33.303
Sir, what is this?

14:33.400 --> 14:36.244
You are not a marriage material

14:36.300 --> 14:39.975
Jai, you are my best agent, that is it

14:40.033 --> 14:41.444
That is the only thing

14:45.367 --> 14:48.678
If wife asks about husband's job,
you have to only lie

14:48.767 --> 14:53.580
You'll have to always lie
That is what your fate is

14:55.133 --> 14:58.137
Yes, dad
I thought well and decided

14:58.233 --> 15:01.237
As you all think I didn't want
a husband with an high level job...

15:01.333 --> 15:02.710
...too many ambitions

15:02.767 --> 15:05.680
I have not thought about
a person like that even in my heart

15:05.767 --> 15:08.771
I want to live with a man
of my liking, that's all

15:09.000 --> 15:10.274
Then where is he now?

15:10.367 --> 15:15.112
Dad, Jai will come
I'm sure about it

15:16.467 --> 15:19.573
If you go quickly, you can reach
for your marriage on time

15:27.700 --> 15:31.341
How much ever strongly you may say,
I'm unable to believe it

15:32.500 --> 15:37.279
When the invitees mock at me
I don't know what I should tell them

15:38.500 --> 15:41.606
You put me to such a shame

15:42.567 --> 15:44.547
Now I'll go and tell everyone

15:44.633 --> 15:47.739
The groom has ducked out
The marriage has been cancelled

15:54.000 --> 15:58.107
For the shame I brought over,
I'll say sorry to everyone

16:57.767 --> 16:59.542
Am I a bit late?

17:09.700 --> 17:10.701
Actually...

17:11.400 --> 17:13.003
It is a big story

17:13.067 --> 17:15.104
Tell me what happened

17:15.200 --> 17:18.374
As today is our marriage
I was really excited

17:18.467 --> 17:20.413
I couldn't sleep a wink
yesterday night

17:21.200 --> 17:23.339
I phoned you
so many times

17:23.433 --> 17:26.642
You didn't attend even a single call
when you say you didn't sleep a wink

17:27.233 --> 17:28.507
I'll tell you

17:29.633 --> 17:32.341
Maybe I left my phone
in silent mode

17:37.233 --> 17:38.143
You!

17:39.767 --> 17:41.371
Do you need only him?

17:41.433 --> 17:43.435
To marry and spend
your life with

18:02.267 --> 18:03.507
Promise?

18:06.067 --> 18:08.343
Do you know what
actually happened?

18:09.100 --> 18:13.207
Yesterday night in sleep
I saw a dream

18:13.800 --> 18:16.644
In that dream the minute
when we saw for the first time

18:17.767 --> 18:19.269
Don't you remember that?

18:21.100 --> 18:26.100
<i>Tiff </i>

18:33.133 --> 18:38.742

19:51.567 --> 19:54.548
- Mam, who is that?
- That is Jai Mohan

19:54.633 --> 19:57.307
First he came here saying
he'll look after the children...

19:57.367 --> 19:59.540
...who were affected in
Bangalore bomb blast

19:59.600 --> 20:01.443
Now he is a regular visitor here

20:01.533 --> 20:03.206
The best friend of the children

20:05.133 --> 20:10.606
"Far away a golden star is following"

20:10.667 --> 20:16.140
"It is blinking on the sky"

20:16.533 --> 20:21.533

someone is murmuring in my ears"

20:31.200 --> 20:32.770

- This is my bag

20:33.000 --> 20:34.308
How can ladies bad be yours?

20:34.367 --> 20:36.176
- Don't lie
- This is my bag

20:45.333 --> 20:51.011

"Are you near my
blossoming heart..."

20:57.333 --> 21:03.045

Is it true or mirage...?"

There is still silence in your heart"

23:56.533 --> 23:59.036
When you got up
why didn't you wake me up?

23:59.100 --> 24:03.446
If I wake you up suddenly like that,
how can I see my darling...

24:03.500 --> 24:08.108
...getting up lazily with her
dress in disordered form

24:08.200 --> 24:11.409
...with skin showing her and there?

24:11.467 --> 24:13.105
Stop...Jai

24:20.367 --> 24:23.143
Every day I must get up first

24:23.400 --> 24:26.142
I must make
bed coffee for you, Jai

24:26.233 --> 24:30.272
Make breakfast for you
Iron your cloths

24:30.433 --> 24:32.413
I'm used to doing all
this by myself

24:32.500 --> 24:34.377
You have just arrived here

24:34.433 --> 24:37.346
It is enough if you do
one by one slowly

27:09.100 --> 27:12.138
Are you wondering that
everyone is clapping...

27:12.200 --> 27:14.771
...for the Veerapandiya
Kattabomman for catching Rana?

27:15.000 --> 27:16.138
It is not that, Jai

27:16.233 --> 27:19.305
You have again repeated
the same mistake that you did once

27:19.367 --> 27:21.369
For congratulation is only for that

27:21.734 --> 27:22.678
Mistake?

27:24.300 --> 27:26.473
You have again got married

27:27.467 --> 27:29.469
You won't reform at all

27:30.267 --> 27:32.247
Sir, it is a bore

27:32.300 --> 27:34.211
What you are doing now
is the biggest mistake

27:34.267 --> 27:37.612
Yes, big mistake
What is your true job?

27:37.667 --> 27:40.341
To find terrorist
To run after them

27:40.433 --> 27:43.539
To chase and catch them
To shoot them with gun

27:43.600 --> 27:46.342
Then to admit them in
cremation ground, isn't it?

27:46.433 --> 27:48.538
But in public what are you acting as?

27:48.634 --> 27:53.413
In this Deccan Exports
a real boring day job

27:53.500 --> 27:58.074
Jai, marriage is a baggage
It is a big burden for you

27:58.167 --> 28:00.374
Okay
Shall I ask you one thing?

28:02.467 --> 28:04.276
But don't ask leave
for honey moon

28:04.367 --> 28:05.209
No

28:05.267 --> 28:08.248
How many years it must
be to your marriage?

28:08.633 --> 28:12.342
30...it is 31 years

28:12.433 --> 28:14.640
Why are you asking this
question suddenly now?

28:14.700 --> 28:18.375
Are you still in close
terms with your wife?

28:18.433 --> 28:20.674
I'll hit you

28:20.767 --> 28:24.374
Do you still love
Nafeesa Thatha?

28:24.433 --> 28:25.537
Yes

28:25.634 --> 28:30.606
Still after 31 years of our marriage
I love my wife a lot

28:38.434 --> 28:44.680
In these 31 years have you
told your wife the truth?

28:44.734 --> 28:47.772
This searching for terrorists,
searching them and shooting them

28:48.034 --> 28:51.743
Have you told your loving
wife about your true profession?

28:51.800 --> 28:53.302
How can I tell her?

28:53.367 --> 28:56.780
When the marriage took place I was
working in Delhi in Raw special unit

28:57.000 --> 28:58.980
How can I tell about
my job that time?

28:59.034 --> 29:00.206
I must not tell also

29:00.300 --> 29:05.306
In my family everybody thinks that in
this export company I'm a senior manager

29:05.400 --> 29:06.378
Workaholic

29:06.433 --> 29:08.777
My wife will go
and tell everyone that

29:09.034 --> 29:12.504
...God in the name of work,
here a man will die

29:12.567 --> 29:16.140
Now it is 31 years to our marriage

29:18.267 --> 29:22.147
So yourself conscience
is pricking you from inside...

29:22.233 --> 29:24.235
...for not telling
the truth to your wife

29:24.300 --> 29:25.142
Yes, Jai

29:25.200 --> 29:28.511
In life if there is a law that says
till the end we can't tell anyone outside...

29:28.567 --> 29:29.978
...it can't be erased at all

29:30.033 --> 29:31.569
But in your matter
it is not like that

29:31.633 --> 29:34.512
Because your first wife
divorced you and went away

29:35.467 --> 29:40.473
For her money, career, life
style and looks were more important

29:40.567 --> 29:45.073
Yes, sir! Money, career,
life style, that's all

29:45.200 --> 29:47.180
That is what was
needed to Ramya

29:51.400 --> 29:54.472
- Don't stop me
- Please

29:54.567 --> 29:57.605
I don't know what you are
expecting from this life of ours

29:57.667 --> 30:02.047
Whatever it may be, but
what I'm expecting is surely not that

30:02.100 --> 30:06.606
In our case you are still the same
There is no change at all

30:06.700 --> 30:09.579
The job in your export
company is your first wife

30:10.200 --> 30:14.307
I was the one who was a fool
I was, but not now

30:14.500 --> 30:18.505
Jai, this day when I'm going
away from your life is...

30:18.700 --> 30:21.613
...the most beautiful day of my life

30:22.267 --> 30:24.770
Bye and take care

30:33.033 --> 30:35.035
We lived together for 6 months

30:35.134 --> 30:38.206
And then she left me
and migrated to Canada

30:40.167 --> 30:42.272
But Anjali is not like Ramya

30:42.367 --> 30:45.678
Anjali is a sweet girl and
madly in love with you

30:49.400 --> 30:52.472
But at the same time you are
going to get both good luck...

30:52.567 --> 30:56.777
...and bad luck, MrJai Mohan
by your second wife-

30:57.000 --> 30:59.708
Sir, please
Let me come to the matter

31:14.433 --> 31:18.245
In the many terror attacks that took
place in India, he was prime suspect

31:18.334 --> 31:23.511
If such a suspect has been caught in
Bangalore, it is not a coincidence

31:24.100 --> 31:27.138
That too when important events
are going to take place here

31:27.333 --> 31:30.371
Prime Minister's visit
Islamic peace conference

31:30.467 --> 31:34.677
India vs England cricket match
Rana has planned something

31:36.333 --> 31:38.540
Sir, did Rana say something?

31:40.167 --> 31:41.771
Till now Rana has not said anything

32:26.300 --> 32:28.473
Wish you a happy married life, sir!

32:29.034 --> 32:30.069
No...no

32:30.600 --> 32:33.547
How to say in Malayalam?

32:34.700 --> 32:37.681
My good wishes for
your married life, right?

32:38.300 --> 32:40.644
I know 9 languages

32:40.733 --> 32:43.543
Didn't you like this Malayalam, sir?

32:44.033 --> 32:47.014
When two Malayalee's
meet it can be seen

32:47.100 --> 32:48.408
How do we know?

32:49.367 --> 32:52.348
Asking whether he is a Malayalee
you come running and hug

32:52.400 --> 32:54.277
All you Mallu people

32:54.600 --> 32:57.410
Victor Rana, bloody beggar

32:57.467 --> 32:59.037
After this not only in Malayalam...

32:59.100 --> 33:02.138
...even if you catch hold of someone
in capital, no one will come here

33:02.200 --> 33:03.304
Do you understand?

33:03.367 --> 33:07.008
So the 9 languages that you
have studied is of no use here

33:07.400 --> 33:11.143
No one will come to know that you
are caught and put in this cage here

33:11.233 --> 33:13.076
Not even the Prime
Minister of this country

33:13.167 --> 33:17.047
Even if you die and rotten here,
no one will come to know

33:17.233 --> 33:20.510
No one can save you
Unless some miracle saves you

33:23.134 --> 33:25.273
I have planned something

33:25.333 --> 33:27.609
If they have got to be
stopped from happening...

33:27.700 --> 33:29.304
...only miracle has to take place

33:29.367 --> 33:30.345
Do you understand?

33:50.234 --> 33:53.010
I called you to ask what I
should cook for dinner

33:53.367 --> 33:57.782
I have got with me
mother's recipe book

33:58.000 --> 34:01.277
Whatever special dish
you need, tell me

34:01.367 --> 34:04.109
Nothing like that
Anything will do

34:05.600 --> 34:08.170
- Do you like veg roll, Jai?
-Yes...yes

34:08.234 --> 34:11.043
- Bengun bhanha?
- Okay

34:13.733 --> 34:15.542
What about Bengun Masala?

34:15.600 --> 34:18.638
- By mixing masala in brinjal
-Anything, sweety

34:18.699 --> 34:21.373
Whatever you prepare
is good for me

34:23.167 --> 34:25.373
Okay, listen
I'm busy in work at present

34:25.434 --> 34:27.539
I'll call you later on
Okay? Okay

34:33.434 --> 34:38.782
You have put me in prison here
This Victor Rana

34:39.033 --> 34:42.775
But it is not me who is going
through the torture, it is you

35:24.734 --> 35:27.044
- Are you a Malayali?
-Yes

35:27.134 --> 35:28.670
- Are you new here?
-Yes

35:28.734 --> 35:30.543
- In which flat?
-306

35:30.600 --> 35:33.342
- Jai's...?
-Yes, I'm Jai's wife

35:33.434 --> 35:35.641
That is good
When did this take place?

35:35.700 --> 35:40.274
Did Jai get married for the second time?
Without any of our knowledge?

35:40.367 --> 35:42.074
Everything was quick

35:55.067 --> 35:57.377
Sir, this was what
collected from Rana's room

35:57.467 --> 35:59.037
Apart from his bag and cloths

36:02.500 --> 36:03.240
No, sir

36:03.300 --> 36:07.248
As we know no one here
uses cellphone and laptop

36:07.300 --> 36:10.304
That will lead to their
boss across the border

36:10.400 --> 36:12.971
If we have to get the root
of the net used by him...

36:13.034 --> 36:17.574
...see if there is any net cafe
near by the hotel where he stayed

36:17.667 --> 36:20.045
We must sniff there

36:22.067 --> 36:25.378
Your cellphone has just
received a text from your wife

36:29.000 --> 36:31.241
From wife
Message

36:31.334 --> 36:32.404
Go ahead

36:46.334 --> 36:51.579
This is going to be your life
most dangerous under cover mission

36:51.667 --> 36:52.975
Yes, sir
Rana

36:53.034 --> 36:54.980
Not Rana
Rani (Queen)

36:55.034 --> 36:57.412
YourAnjali
Your marriage

37:09.167 --> 37:12.580
If you open this door,
I'll come inside and tell you in detail

37:16.300 --> 37:18.576
- Is it for me?
-Come

37:19.567 --> 37:22.514
I moved the couch
from here to guest room

37:22.567 --> 37:24.569
Then dining to this side

37:25.234 --> 37:26.770
Then our TV

37:27.034 --> 37:30.504
I set that to that corner
Then some of your awful paintings

37:30.567 --> 37:33.343
I gave that to
the sweeper to get rid

37:34.500 --> 37:37.310
if you continue like this,
you'll discard me also...

37:37.367 --> 37:40.075
...and make that old sweeper
in the downstairs stay here

37:40.134 --> 37:42.205
- Okay, I'll see
- Let me see

38:03.800 --> 38:06.542
Listen, now you are not
single and a bachelor

38:06.634 --> 38:08.238
There is one more
person with you

38:08.300 --> 38:10.109
- I got used to be single
- Come...come

38:11.500 --> 38:16.040
I prayed and prepared all this thinking
this fat guy should be really hungry

38:16.134 --> 38:18.307
Really? Else I'll bite and eat you

38:21.400 --> 38:24.540
- How is it?
- Super, fantastic, amazing

38:24.600 --> 38:27.376
But you didn't taste at all
Are you making fun of me?

38:27.467 --> 38:28.969
Then I'll eat and
tell you, come

38:29.034 --> 38:31.674
No, you are so mean
I made all this with so much love

38:31.734 --> 38:33.680
And you are just
making fun of me

38:38.400 --> 38:40.710
What happened?
Didn't you like?

38:42.067 --> 38:45.207
It can be good
If you wish, it can be better

38:45.300 --> 38:46.210
What?

38:47.234 --> 38:49.077
Let me taste and
see all these

38:58.600 --> 39:01.479
What happened, Jai?
Didn't you like my cooking?

39:01.567 --> 39:06.710
If you ask me whether I have eaten
such a tasty food before this, no

39:08.067 --> 39:09.375
Haven't you heard?

39:09.434 --> 39:14.713
I wish to kiss those fingers
which cooked such wonderful food

39:17.034 --> 39:20.072
No need for Hollywood style love

39:20.167 --> 39:22.408
Today it'll be Hollywood style

39:33.800 --> 39:36.178
- Hello!
-Jai, what are you doing?

39:36.634 --> 39:39.274
I have not done
anything till now, sir

39:39.367 --> 39:42.075
Okay, you need not do anything
You come immediately

39:43.300 --> 39:47.248
We have found the internet cafe
which used by Rana

39:47.334 --> 39:49.439
You come here immediately

39:52.434 --> 39:55.381
There is an emergency in office

39:55.800 --> 39:58.041
I'll go soon and
come back soon

40:08.067 --> 40:12.209
Jai, in export company what
emergency is there at night?

40:12.267 --> 40:15.714
One of the company's ships was
picked and dropped by crow in the sea

40:15.800 --> 40:17.677
I'll swim, find that and come

40:39.533 --> 40:43.106
This is Rana's ID proof
Copy of the passport

40:43.400 --> 40:45.505
In this the name is JameerAhmed

40:46.100 --> 40:49.775
Then the details of his net log
in which he has done many days

40:50.034 --> 40:52.674
That is the computer which was
used by Rana on the last day

40:53.600 --> 40:57.173
Interestingly he used
the same terminal every time

40:57.634 --> 41:00.114
He won't have left
anything to crash and enter

41:00.200 --> 41:01.508
He must have wiped out everything

41:01.567 --> 41:04.980
You are absolutely right, sir
Everything has been wiped out

41:05.067 --> 41:08.480
Browsers, cash files, book marks,
history and everything

41:08.767 --> 41:12.613
Afile that was attached to e-mail and
sent by Rana, I managed to track that, sir

41:12.700 --> 41:14.202
But it is password protected

41:14.267 --> 41:18.079
With your database experience
we must try something

41:20.700 --> 41:22.338
Let me check it out

42:11.667 --> 42:12.645
What is this?

42:12.700 --> 42:15.306
Now did you see
that small boy pissing?

42:15.367 --> 42:16.710
A visually innocent photo

42:16.767 --> 42:19.646
When we open the cover and remove
the knots of that photo we'll know

42:19.700 --> 42:24.445
The secret message to kill whom
all is hidden in that by Rana

42:24.534 --> 42:25.444
- Christy!
- Sir

42:25.500 --> 42:27.480
Try to decode this code

43:14.700 --> 43:16.509
Cupid's arrow

43:17.300 --> 43:20.611
What is the love God
called in 5 letters?

43:20.700 --> 43:21.701
Lover

43:22.733 --> 43:25.009
You are too good, baby

43:25.067 --> 43:26.740
- I know
- Lover

43:32.267 --> 43:34.440
Jai, shall I ask you one thing?

43:34.534 --> 43:35.706
Ask me

43:36.367 --> 43:39.109
What does it mean by
export executive?

43:42.500 --> 43:44.639
What is your real job?

43:48.300 --> 43:50.507
Before this you have not asked
anything to me like this

43:50.567 --> 43:52.171
Now what happened suddenly?

43:52.267 --> 43:56.238
Shouldn't wives know
about husband's job?

43:56.300 --> 43:57.677
What do you mean by wives?

43:57.734 --> 43:59.611
Do I have another
wife other than you?

43:59.667 --> 44:01.442
Jai, tell me

44:01.600 --> 44:05.104
If I must say correctly,
it is a bit complicated

44:05.167 --> 44:06.703
Jai, tell me please

44:06.767 --> 44:09.179
lfl say it simplicatedly

44:10.200 --> 44:10.769
okay

44:11.000 --> 44:15.278
In this Indian country there
are lying many unwanted things

44:15.334 --> 44:16.745
Useless commodities

44:17.000 --> 44:18.604
I must enquire and find that

44:18.667 --> 44:20.442
And then to export that is my job

44:21.100 --> 44:23.239
What do you mean by
useless commodities?

44:23.334 --> 44:25.507
Is it our dirty politicians?

44:26.134 --> 44:32.380
At night when everything is
over and we are lying awake...

44:32.434 --> 44:34.539
...I'll tell in your ears in detail

44:39.334 --> 44:42.281
'For you good luck and
bad luck is going to come...'

44:42.334 --> 44:45.110
'...at the same time due
to your second wife'

45:08.367 --> 45:11.439
On decoding that image
the message that I got is this, sir

45:11.500 --> 45:13.411
It seems to be meaningless

45:13.600 --> 45:15.637
I think I know what it means

45:16.767 --> 45:19.441
Sir, this is a simple Chinese grid

45:19.500 --> 45:23.710
It'll rearrange itself
and you'll read like this

45:48.300 --> 45:49.472
AYES HA?

45:54.400 --> 45:59.145
- Do you have any idea, Jai?
- Sir, birthday candles

45:59.334 --> 46:02.440
Candles can mean weapons

46:02.500 --> 46:04.673
AYESHA...who the hell is she?

46:04.734 --> 46:07.010
She might be a terrorist
contact in the city, sir

46:07.067 --> 46:10.446
Otherwise it could be the person who
takes delivery of the weapons here

46:15.534 --> 46:17.775
- You pick up the call please
- Thank you, sir

46:18.734 --> 46:21.408
We are all talking
about National Security

46:21.500 --> 46:24.777
I think sir must be having
a bigger problem at home

46:25.000 --> 46:26.638
Please go ahead

46:27.534 --> 46:30.071
- Sir, my wife-
- Please

46:30.167 --> 46:31.373
Thank you

46:33.700 --> 46:35.702
- Hello!
- Hi, Jai!

46:36.067 --> 46:40.072
While coming from office
can you get me some Zucchini?

46:40.267 --> 46:41.575
What was that?

46:42.067 --> 46:43.705
Zucchini yaar
Zucchini

46:47.467 --> 46:51.040
Sir, can we continue the meeting?

46:55.300 --> 46:58.179
Whoever or wherever
this Ayesha might be

46:58.234 --> 47:00.407
Ourmainjob is to
trace her out

47:00.500 --> 47:01.342
Zucchini

47:01.400 --> 47:04.779
But it is not an easy thing
Our first move should be

47:05.000 --> 47:06.479
- Zucchini
-What?

47:06.534 --> 47:10.778
- Zucchini any idea?
- No, sir I don't know

47:11.633 --> 47:15.240
Leave your Zucchini
Look at Ayesha

47:16.467 --> 47:17.411
Sorry, sir

47:17.500 --> 47:18.535
AVesha!

47:18.634 --> 47:19.704
Yes, Ayes ha

47:20.334 --> 47:22.075
Yes, of course

47:22.167 --> 47:26.274
I knowAyesha
I have a crush over her

47:27.000 --> 47:29.344
I have seen all her movies

47:29.434 --> 47:32.347
But I didn't get

47:32.400 --> 47:34.038
She got married
and went away

47:36.200 --> 47:38.271
Don't screw on me, Rana

47:38.334 --> 47:40.280
It is not Ayesha Takia
It is Ayesha

47:40.334 --> 47:41.108
No

47:41.167 --> 47:42.578
I'll kill you

47:42.667 --> 47:44.613
You are wasting
your time with me

47:44.667 --> 47:45.771
Okay boss

47:54.600 --> 47:58.104
Christy, from his hotel room
the evidences that we seized

47:58.200 --> 47:59.702
I want to see one more time

48:18.034 --> 48:19.775
What are you
searching inside that?

48:20.000 --> 48:21.104
I don't know, sir

48:21.200 --> 48:23.077
May be this thing
This might help

48:23.167 --> 48:25.773
This is not one but the bill
of two people having coffee

48:26.034 --> 48:28.605
Rana met somebody
in this coffee shop

48:33.334 --> 48:34.608
Have you not seen?

48:41.567 --> 48:48.212
This man...he was not glamorous
enough to keep in memory, sir

48:48.267 --> 48:52.545
But the girl who used to
come with him here regularly

48:53.767 --> 48:59.308
if shejust looks at us, we won't-

48:59.367 --> 49:01.472
We won't know what we should do

49:01.567 --> 49:02.307
Sir!

49:02.367 --> 49:03.675
I think he knows something

49:03.733 --> 49:08.978
If she goes from our front,
we can't take off our eyes

49:09.200 --> 49:12.238
- From her back, isn't it?
-Yes, we can't

49:12.400 --> 49:13.606
Come, talk to sir

49:14.767 --> 49:17.043
Have you also seen with him?

49:18.067 --> 49:20.047
Yes, sir I have also seen

49:20.534 --> 49:21.205
Then?

49:21.267 --> 49:25.113
When I used to see her with him,
I used to be really jealous of him

49:25.167 --> 49:29.411
That is why I have kept him in
my mind without forgetting him

49:29.467 --> 49:34.348
Zulfi, you go to the room
and have bath in cold water

49:38.600 --> 49:41.080
There are three CCTV cameras here

49:44.300 --> 49:46.302
- Yes, sir
- Take the visuals and check it

49:46.400 --> 49:47.105
Yes sir

49:47.167 --> 49:51.547
That friend of Rana who is hotter than
the coffee here, shouldn't we see her?

49:51.600 --> 49:52.772
Yes sir, sure

50:31.567 --> 50:35.538
- Is this Ayesha?
-I can't say for sure

50:49.467 --> 50:50.605
Zucchini is not needed

50:50.700 --> 50:54.113
I was about to go to
the shop to get Zucchini for you

50:54.200 --> 50:57.647
- Are you sure you don't want it?
- Today's cooking is cancelled here

50:57.734 --> 51:00.237
Is it only cooking or...

51:01.467 --> 51:03.606
Jai, do you remember
Nambiyar uncle?

51:03.667 --> 51:04.668
Daddy's close friend

51:04.800 --> 51:09.044
Is he daddy's close friend?
Surely he must be a big bore

51:09.333 --> 51:10.471
Jai, listen me

51:10.534 --> 51:12.605
Today evening there is
a party from Nam biyar's side

51:12.667 --> 51:13.737
We have to go

51:15.267 --> 51:16.439
Very bad

51:16.500 --> 51:20.175
Couldn't you have told me
earlier about Nambiyar uncle?

51:20.233 --> 51:22.440
Jai, please
Don't say as no

51:22.500 --> 51:25.640
Meena, that Patel's dealing
Why there is a delay?

51:25.734 --> 51:27.179
Have you done with it?

51:27.234 --> 51:29.305
To who else I must
tell in this office?

51:32.034 --> 51:33.707
Dear, sorry

51:33.800 --> 51:38.078
I'm very busy in the office

51:39.033 --> 51:43.379
But even if I don't come, you must
go for Nambiyar uncle's party

51:44.400 --> 51:46.038
Now itself people are asking...

51:46.100 --> 51:49.240
Why we couldn't go even for
a honey moon that you are so busy?

51:49.300 --> 51:51.109
That too in that
lousy export company

51:53.267 --> 51:54.610
Jai, please

51:54.700 --> 51:57.112
Don't put me to shame
in front of others at least today

51:57.167 --> 52:00.637
You do one thing
You go directly to the party

52:00.734 --> 52:02.543
I'll try my maximum to come

52:02.667 --> 52:04.613
If by chancel don't come...

52:04.667 --> 52:10.242
You stay with daddy today and tell
daddy to drop you early morning

52:10.334 --> 52:11.335
What do you say?

52:11.500 --> 52:12.638
Nonsense

52:18.267 --> 52:19.712
What happened, sir?

52:21.434 --> 52:22.538
Nonsense

52:47.467 --> 52:48.468
Dear!

52:48.567 --> 52:50.274
Didn't you go to the party?

52:50.334 --> 52:52.507
If I had gone, would I be
standing here like a tree?

52:52.567 --> 52:54.103
Why didn't you Q0?

52:54.200 --> 52:56.202
Nam biyar uncle must have
really felt bad

52:56.300 --> 53:00.077
Then your daddy
He must have expected you a lot

53:00.167 --> 53:02.169
How concerned you
are about them?

53:02.233 --> 53:04.611
It is your Nambiyar uncle
and our daddy

53:04.667 --> 53:05.975
Stop this drama, Jai

53:06.067 --> 53:08.013
If you had wanted, you
could have come earlier

53:08.067 --> 53:10.547
Actually what happened
today is a story

53:10.600 --> 53:12.273
Stop these false stories, Jai

53:12.334 --> 53:13.779
It is not just like that I didn't go

53:14.000 --> 53:16.344
Who'll understand about my
husband's busy schedule there?

53:16.434 --> 53:18.209
Is this export executive

53:18.267 --> 53:21.077
American President to keep
this whole world on his head?

53:21.134 --> 53:22.340
Dear...!

53:22.467 --> 53:26.074
On showing white flag
you shouldn't lift weapon

53:26.267 --> 53:28.679
Even Pakistan people
won't do that

53:30.300 --> 53:34.578
After this even if we are invited to
Nam biyar sir's dog's birthday, we'll go

53:35.767 --> 53:36.677
okay

53:36.767 --> 53:39.145
- Fine what is the plan?
- Plan?

53:39.200 --> 53:40.304
Plan what?

53:40.367 --> 53:44.611
- We'll go out and have dinner
- That is not a concession

53:44.700 --> 53:46.373
- There is no other alternative
-Why?

53:46.434 --> 53:48.539
Becausel have not
prepared any food here

53:48.600 --> 53:51.206
I'll become fresh and
come immediately

54:02.167 --> 54:08.675
"On the sand of the back
water bed when sunsets"

54:09.167 --> 54:10.510
Enough
Stop it

54:10.600 --> 54:13.137
I'm fed up of this song

54:13.200 --> 54:14.645
Have you not left that till now?

54:14.733 --> 54:17.475
I told you that I didn't do
it purposely it happened

54:17.533 --> 54:19.035
For that should I hold your feet?

54:19.100 --> 54:20.044
No need

54:20.100 --> 54:23.081
But when you say sorry,
don't say it as a charity

54:23.167 --> 54:25.204
What do you want now?
I'll do that

54:25.267 --> 54:27.110
You drive fast
I want to eat

54:35.667 --> 54:37.374
What do you want to eat?

54:41.433 --> 54:44.437
There is not an item
called 'Anything' here

54:45.033 --> 54:45.704
What?

54:45.767 --> 54:47.371
I'll go to rest room and come

54:47.467 --> 54:49.413
When I come,
the food should be here

54:49.467 --> 54:50.969
Do you understand?

54:56.467 --> 54:58.140
- Bearer!
-Yes, sir

55:07.100 --> 55:09.706
As soon as that sister comes,
you serve the food

55:11.500 --> 55:13.411
- As soon as she arrives
- Sir

55:13.500 --> 55:15.411
- Swing into action
- Sure, sir-

55:26.267 --> 55:27.678
With love, Jai

55:33.000 --> 55:34.070
Perfect

55:35.434 --> 55:36.606
Hi, Jai Mohan!

55:50.200 --> 55:51.338
How come you are here?

55:51.400 --> 55:53.346
- I thought you are in Canada
-I was in Canada

55:53.400 --> 55:55.539
Day before yesterday
onlyl reached Bangalore

55:56.467 --> 55:58.242
What is all this?

55:58.334 --> 56:02.976
Candles Roses
What is this, Jai Mohan?

56:03.767 --> 56:05.542
Who is in company
with you for dinner?

56:05.634 --> 56:06.339
Nothing

56:06.400 --> 56:09.006
- Shall I take the seat?
- She will be

56:15.367 --> 56:21.409
"Every night in my dreams
I see you I feel you"

56:21.467 --> 56:22.707
How sweet!

56:23.567 --> 56:26.343
I never expected that
you'll remember me all these while

56:26.434 --> 56:28.209
Ramya, actually

56:28.267 --> 56:29.302
No, Jai

56:29.367 --> 56:30.573
Come on

56:30.667 --> 56:32.408
I can't believe this

56:32.734 --> 56:34.611
I'm so excited

56:36.267 --> 56:37.473
What?

56:45.767 --> 56:47.508
This is Ramya

56:51.567 --> 56:53.205
I am Jai's

56:53.667 --> 56:54.975
I know

56:56.433 --> 56:58.106
You can introduce me to her

56:58.167 --> 57:00.147
Anjali, my wife

57:01.367 --> 57:04.233
Jai, did you get married again?

57:04.234 --> 57:08.114
Is there any rule that
Jai can't marry again?

57:08.200 --> 57:09.440
Not that

57:09.767 --> 57:11.110
Jai Mohan

57:12.033 --> 57:14.104
Doesn't he have
the eligibility for that?

57:14.400 --> 57:19.042
- If you ask like that, yes
- Ramya, come on

57:19.600 --> 57:21.045
Ramya, was it only my mistake?

57:21.100 --> 57:23.512
You could have given me
some more time

57:24.734 --> 57:26.611
I didn't mean like that

57:26.700 --> 57:30.671
Both of you have lot of
time still for compromise

57:30.734 --> 57:33.078
- Bye, Ramya
- Dear, please

57:33.167 --> 57:35.647
You can compromise on all
your old problems and then come

57:35.700 --> 57:38.476
I don't know anything
She appeared suddenly

57:38.534 --> 57:39.740
Enjoy your dinner

57:44.700 --> 57:46.976
In future never enter
my life like this

57:53.734 --> 57:57.011
Dear please listen

57:57.067 --> 57:59.069
- Regret Gateway
- Okay, mad am

58:26.033 --> 58:29.776
- Why are you taking this route?
- This is short cut, madam

58:42.534 --> 58:44.036
Shiva, come here

58:46.267 --> 58:47.541
One minute, madam

58:47.634 --> 58:51.241
Driver, take me fast
Else I'll call police

58:51.300 --> 58:53.405
You can call the police

58:53.500 --> 58:54.535
See here

58:54.600 --> 58:57.774
Here no police will come
It is our place

59:00.200 --> 59:02.202
Where are you going?

59:02.800 --> 59:04.404
Catch hold of her

59:07.100 --> 59:08.443
Don't let her go

59:08.733 --> 59:10.041
Heymstop

59:49.000 --> 59:51.537
Our car has been parked
in that corner

59:51.600 --> 59:53.341
Quietly you go and sit in that

59:53.600 --> 59:57.639
I don't like anyone else
other than me chasing my wife

59:57.734 --> 01:00:01.705
I'm going to ask them
decently to return my wife's purse

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.007
Instead of that I'm not
going to hurt them

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:06.308
They will hurt you,
They are bad people

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:11.149
You go and sit in the car
Count slowly till 15

01:00:11.233 --> 01:00:13.338
- Even after that if I don't come
- If you don't come?

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:16.347
You drive the car fast
and call the police

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.712
If you want to remain alive,
run away from here

01:00:55.767 --> 01:00:57.713
Else I'll chop you to pieces

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:20.373
Kill him

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.006
Here

01:02:24.767 --> 01:02:26.769
- After today
-Yes, sir

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.504
If you trouble any
lonely girl on the way

01:02:30.733 --> 01:02:32.974
I'll become your problem

01:02:33.067 --> 01:02:34.137
Yes, sir

01:02:35.167 --> 01:02:36.339
Do you understand?

01:02:47.634 --> 01:02:50.171
How did you get this?
What did you tell them?

01:02:50.234 --> 01:02:54.546
I told them that she is my wife
Anjali, it is her purse

01:02:54.633 --> 01:02:58.410
Give it back to me as
I have to make her happy

01:03:33.033 --> 01:03:36.173
What is yourJai saying?
Where did you go for honeymoon?

01:03:36.233 --> 01:03:37.007
Nowhere

01:03:37.067 --> 01:03:39.479
Jai is very busy, so we thought
we'll go next month

01:03:39.534 --> 01:03:41.241
What busy?

01:03:41.334 --> 01:03:43.678
That too in an
ordinary export company

01:03:43.734 --> 01:03:47.307
We know that earth is not rotating
on the nose tip of Deccan Exports

01:03:47.367 --> 01:03:51.747
But the way Jai behaves you'll feel
as if he is in intensive care unit

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:52.710
I agree

01:03:52.767 --> 01:03:54.644
Are you happy?
That is enough

01:03:56.434 --> 01:03:58.107
But there is only one problem

01:03:58.167 --> 01:04:00.443
As soon as he returns from
office he'll see whether...

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:03.003
...all the TV remote
buttons are working properly?

01:04:03.067 --> 01:04:04.045
Why?

01:04:04.334 --> 01:04:05.312
Dumb girl!

01:04:05.367 --> 01:04:09.008
Without minding me he'll change
and keep seeing all the news channels

01:04:10.367 --> 01:04:13.314
But I really love this, Priya
This role of a wife

01:04:13.367 --> 01:04:17.247
Cooking food forJai
washing and ironing Jai's clothes

01:04:17.334 --> 01:04:19.280
Then in-between fighting with him

01:04:19.333 --> 01:04:21.074
I'm happy TOT V°u

01:04:21.167 --> 01:04:24.774
But it is not enough if you remain at
home washing clothes and cooking food

01:04:25.034 --> 01:04:26.672
Come back to work
Seriously

01:04:26.734 --> 01:04:29.180
In your daddy's office
we all miss you

01:04:35.333 --> 01:04:36.710
Is this Ayesha?

01:04:38.034 --> 01:04:39.206
This is not Ayesha

01:04:39.467 --> 01:04:40.571
It is Laila

01:04:40.667 --> 01:04:42.669
- That is what her name is
- Laila

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:46.276
Here in the 'Chacha' club
she is performing now

01:04:46.367 --> 01:04:50.179
Recently she has done an
item number in a Tamil movie

01:04:50.467 --> 01:04:54.176
But she didn't succeed Laila
didn't have any flex and licks

01:04:54.234 --> 01:04:55.304
sorry

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.404
No luck in flex

01:04:58.767 --> 01:05:01.543
But Laila knows Tamil
Little bit

01:05:01.734 --> 01:05:03.645
Does she know Tamil?

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.307
How does she look, sir?

01:05:11.367 --> 01:05:16.715
Even if I behave naughtily with her and
my wife comes to know, it is not wrong

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:19.508
- Shall I put inside?
-What?

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.637
I meant shall I arrest her

01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:23.475
We can do the interrogation in jail

01:05:23.533 --> 01:05:24.238
Fool!

01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:27.770
We can't put her in lock up
just like that for questioning

01:05:28.267 --> 01:05:33.216
Laila is the only clue between
this terror plan and us

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.412
Look here, no mistake
must take place

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.303
We must handle her with utmost care

01:05:39.367 --> 01:05:40.710
- Do you understand?
- Sir

01:05:43.034 --> 01:05:46.072
If we arrest her now and
come to know later...

01:05:46.167 --> 01:05:48.647
...there is no connection between
that girl and terror plan

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:51.704
...that'll become a big
controversy in media and public

01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:00.606
This was sent by your wife to
the office through a boy in the flat

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:14.978
'From today bye bye
to junk foods'

01:06:15.067 --> 01:06:17.547
'Without failing I'll send
daily lunch box in the afternoon'

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.637
'With lots of love'

01:06:22.367 --> 01:06:25.507
Jai, after marriage
everyone becomes fat

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:27.273
But bachelors are not like that

01:06:27.333 --> 01:06:28.573
Do you know why?

01:06:33.167 --> 01:06:41.177
"Oh Kindness Oh kindness"

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:48.474
"Laila Oh Laila"

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:57.474
"The poet called Majnu
is doing poetry on me"

01:06:57.567 --> 01:06:58.511
"Oh Laila"

01:06:58.567 --> 01:07:03.482
"Who is my special man he
has written in the diary"

01:07:03.534 --> 01:07:07.710
"Laila Oh Laila
Laila Oh Laila"

01:07:08.134 --> 01:07:13.015
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

01:07:13.234 --> 01:07:22.484
"Oh Kindness
Oh kindness"

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:52.746
"I'm brighter than stars and moon"

01:07:53.134 --> 01:07:59.244
"I'm the most desirable
woman in this world"

01:07:59.334 --> 01:08:04.306
"My beauty is one that
can create ecstasy"

01:08:05.367 --> 01:08:11.443
"I'm such a Laila who
troubles all the men around"

01:08:11.534 --> 01:08:18.144
"Oh my man, you are
the craziest lover of mine"

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:26.278
"Oh Kindness
Oh kindness"

01:08:30.633 --> 01:08:35.776
"The poet called Majnu
is doing poetry on me"

01:08:36.033 --> 01:08:36.738
"Oh Laila"

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:42.045
"Who is my special man he
has written in the diary"

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:46.377
"Laila Oh Laila
Laila Oh Laila"

01:08:48.567 --> 01:08:52.572
"Laila Oh Laila"

01:09:00.767 --> 01:09:02.974
Hey!
That flower is mine

01:09:06.033 --> 01:09:07.706
- Excuse me!
-Yes

01:09:09.567 --> 01:09:13.379
- Who are you?
- Laila, for you

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.981
Are you returning
my own flower to me?

01:09:21.067 --> 01:09:22.546
You are smart

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:25.136
When Victor told me,
I didn't think that you'll be so superb

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:28.511
You know little bit Tamil
That is what Victor told me about you

01:09:28.567 --> 01:09:30.569
- Are you Victor's friend?
- Victor's friend!

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:31.407
No...no

01:09:31.466 --> 01:09:32.537
Not at all

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:36.412
He is not my friend
He is like my brother

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:37.410
See this

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:41.705
That is my name

01:09:41.767 --> 01:09:44.542
- Deccan Exports
- My company's name

01:09:45.234 --> 01:09:46.611
We are in the exports

01:09:46.667 --> 01:09:50.513
But now we want to
get into film production

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.170
- Really?
-Yes, really

01:09:52.234 --> 01:09:54.646
Hindi, Tamil,
bilingual film

01:09:55.134 --> 01:09:56.738
The name of
the movie is 'Devi'

01:09:57.001 --> 01:09:59.140
A very strong lady character

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:00.440
Devika

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:05.210
You were famous for sex talk,
exposure, you know

01:10:05.734 --> 01:10:10.308
Who is doing the title
role of Devika?

01:10:10.634 --> 01:10:12.136
We were searching

01:10:12.234 --> 01:10:17.047
But after meeting you, Laila

01:10:17.134 --> 01:10:19.410
Didn't Victor tell you
anything about me?

01:10:19.467 --> 01:10:21.674
You know Victor
He is like that only

01:10:21.734 --> 01:10:23.680
He is full of secrets
and surprises

01:10:23.767 --> 01:10:28.978
But you are so beautiful
You must act in films

01:10:29.067 --> 01:10:30.705
You must act

01:10:34.634 --> 01:10:36.511
This is my address

01:10:40.667 --> 01:10:42.613
Shobha Lavender

01:10:48.067 --> 01:10:51.139
We'll discuss about movies there

01:11:12.467 --> 01:11:17.177
After searching all over Deccan Exports
you couldn't get a pen

01:11:17.467 --> 01:11:19.674
But you got lip stick easily, isn't it?

01:11:20.634 --> 01:11:21.635
TRUE

01:11:21.767 --> 01:11:23.474
This is what I also thought

01:11:23.567 --> 01:11:26.776
On searching urgently, I didn't
get pen, but I got lipstick

01:11:27.001 --> 01:11:28.605
That is the joke

01:11:28.667 --> 01:11:30.044
- Here
-Yes

01:11:30.467 --> 01:11:31.969
Whose address is this?

01:11:32.034 --> 01:11:33.308
That is Lai-

01:11:34.434 --> 01:11:37.506
It is a client's address
Shipping line client

01:11:38.334 --> 01:11:43.408
Why your client
drawn heart in this?

01:11:43.467 --> 01:11:45.413
It is simple

01:11:45.467 --> 01:11:48.311
That client must
be a heart patient

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:49.071
What?

01:11:49.134 --> 01:11:50.374
May be he is

01:11:50.467 --> 01:11:53.607
We will believe that
client is a heart patient

01:12:28.367 --> 01:12:30.074
Why did you come late today?

01:12:32.467 --> 01:12:34.344
Where were you today evening?

01:12:34.434 --> 01:12:36.436
I had gone to zoo Zoo

01:12:37.034 --> 01:12:38.012
God!

01:12:38.067 --> 01:12:39.239
Tell the truth, Jai

01:12:39.301 --> 01:12:41.747
Today evening when I called
your office, your receptionist...

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.604
...told me that you had left early

01:12:44.034 --> 01:12:46.071
Did she say like that?
She is crazy

01:12:46.767 --> 01:12:50.146
Do you employ crazy
people in Deccan Exports?

01:12:50.234 --> 01:12:52.180
Not all are crazy
But she is crazy

01:12:52.234 --> 01:12:54.737
The day we got married
her craziness started

01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:59.671
- Are you having an affair?
-Yes, I do have

01:12:59.734 --> 01:13:00.974
With whom?

01:13:01.134 --> 01:13:02.078
Tell me

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:04.180
- Who is she?
- Shall I tell you?

01:13:05.667 --> 01:13:08.307
With this Anjali

01:13:18.434 --> 01:13:21.074
I thought it is lady servant

01:13:21.134 --> 01:13:21.703
No

01:13:27.767 --> 01:13:29.246
You sit down

01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:31.780
For a minute
I'll change and come

01:13:32.034 --> 01:13:32.978
okay

01:13:52.734 --> 01:13:53.735
God!

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:03.242
Will it be too long?
Your story narration

01:14:04.067 --> 01:14:05.740
Yes!
It depends

01:14:11.234 --> 01:14:17.617
Don't you know how difficult it
is to be such a beautiful woman?

01:14:17.667 --> 01:14:19.112
Don't you know?

01:14:19.201 --> 01:14:22.546
How can I remain quiet after
seeing such a beautiful girl like you?

01:14:22.601 --> 01:14:26.276
You don't know how much
trouble you are giving to a man

01:14:26.367 --> 01:14:27.744
Is it so?

01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:30.340
I feel hungry

01:14:30.434 --> 01:14:32.710
- I'm hungry
- I'm married

01:14:32.767 --> 01:14:35.304
If you are married,
won't you feel hungry?

01:14:40.034 --> 01:14:42.480
If I tell that now,
the story will get changed

01:14:45.201 --> 01:14:46.578
That is my servant

01:14:46.667 --> 01:14:49.511
If I don't open the door,
she'll come later on

01:14:49.567 --> 01:14:50.739
I have to leave

01:14:52.267 --> 01:14:55.544
How sad!
And what about the story?

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.637
Shall I narrate
the story tomorrow?

01:14:57.700 --> 01:14:59.771
- Tomorrow we'll meet for lunch
- Okay

01:15:00.034 --> 01:15:02.139
Venue you decide

01:15:02.467 --> 01:15:05.004
Menu I'll tell

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.504
Then...

01:15:09.467 --> 01:15:11.378
Okay, bye
Enough

01:15:30.334 --> 01:15:32.575
Jai, what did your Laila say?

01:15:32.667 --> 01:15:34.704
She didn't bite and
tear me, that's all

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:37.610
- My BP shooted up
- Tell me what happened

01:15:37.667 --> 01:15:40.341
Nothing happened, sir
But it would have happened

01:15:40.434 --> 01:15:42.277
I got saved as the servant came

01:15:47.701 --> 01:15:51.547
In this kind of situations you are sure
to feel regretted for getting married

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.671
- No, I won't regret
-You'll regret

01:15:53.767 --> 01:15:55.178
Even if not now

01:15:55.234 --> 01:15:58.374
All the married men
do regret in the future

01:15:58.434 --> 01:16:00.573
It is only future
We'll see later on

01:16:00.634 --> 01:16:02.705
Jai, shall we eat
something on the way?

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.074
Okay, we'll

01:16:15.001 --> 01:16:18.073
- Didn't you eat lunch today?
- God! I forgot

01:16:18.134 --> 01:16:21.411
- How can you forget lunch?
-As I had lot of work, I forgot

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.776
I'll become fresh and come
We'll have dinner together

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.310
I also prepared lunch
taking lot of trouble

01:16:26.367 --> 01:16:29.314
Today I'll heat up only that
lunch and give you for dinner

01:16:29.367 --> 01:16:31.677
If you had given without telling,
I would have eaten it

01:16:31.734 --> 01:16:32.542
You spoilt it

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:33.740
Go

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:42.171
Ladies perfume smell

01:17:01.467 --> 01:17:06.382
Two chickens, two fried rice

01:17:08.534 --> 01:17:10.172
Sprite

01:17:12.434 --> 01:17:13.572
Liar!

01:17:34.434 --> 01:17:38.041
I need a word
A process against natural law

01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:41.707
A process against natural law
It is a seven letter word

01:17:41.801 --> 01:17:43.371
Is that it?

01:17:43.467 --> 01:17:45.174
What is there to
think so much in that?

01:17:45.267 --> 01:17:46.405
- Husband
- Oh no!

01:17:46.467 --> 01:17:50.472
Okay, I got it
It is miracle

01:17:50.567 --> 01:17:51.705
Miracle

01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:07.773

01:18:08.034 --> 01:18:09.604

I'll show you the lunch

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.539
Driver, follow that blue car

01:18:29.634 --> 01:18:31.136

01:18:35.334 --> 01:18:37.644

cash as you want

01:18:43.234 --> 01:18:44.212

01:18:44.534 --> 01:18:45.274
Is it so?

01:18:45.367 --> 01:18:48.314
I'll go without giving
side on the road

01:18:48.367 --> 01:18:49.345

01:18:49.434 --> 01:18:53.644
Madam, is that person

01:18:54.067 --> 01:18:57.708
Is he weak in
ladies matter, madam?

01:18:57.767 --> 01:18:59.269
Hey, no

01:19:00.467 --> 01:19:01.673
You just drive fast

01:19:01.734 --> 01:19:02.542
Go

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:05.410
I'll drive fast, madam
You be careful

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:08.504
Madam, what do you know?

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:12.776
So many wives are
following their husband

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.312
This is happening daily
I have seen so many like this

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.178
Water

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.480
Sir, we have a situation
in interrogation room

01:21:34.401 --> 01:21:36.039
Oh, no!

01:21:50.467 --> 01:21:52.970
- Christy, inform their families
-Yes, sir

01:21:53.067 --> 01:21:56.537
In autopsy report the reason for
the death shouldn't come out

01:22:00.601 --> 01:22:02.137
Get down

01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:21.302
Why are you covering
your face, madam?

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:27.343
Laila, it is lunchtime

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:28.504
See, madam

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:32.275
Nowa girl will
come out of that building

01:22:32.334 --> 01:22:34.712
She'll go and stand in
front of your husband

01:22:34.767 --> 01:22:38.408
He'll pick her up in car and go
This is what will happen

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:42.770
Where are you?

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.105
See there
Didn't I say correctly?

01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:50.779
I can't find you

01:22:52.334 --> 01:22:53.472
Are you there?

01:22:53.534 --> 01:22:55.445
- Come...come
- I'm coming

01:22:55.534 --> 01:22:59.573
Did you see, madam?
We'll follow them and go

01:22:59.667 --> 01:23:03.979
Already they must have
booked a room in a cheap lodge

01:23:04.034 --> 01:23:05.604
Shut up, idiot!

01:23:05.701 --> 01:23:09.046
I said only what will happen

01:23:31.334 --> 01:23:33.610
As Laila has link with Rana...

01:23:33.734 --> 01:23:37.375
...he'll come straightly
only there for shelter

01:23:37.434 --> 01:23:39.539
On seeing you there he'll escape

01:23:39.634 --> 01:23:41.409
You leave from there immediately

01:24:11.067 --> 01:24:12.774
- I had a small accident
- Oh my God!

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.240
Twist in the story

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:40.178
Come on

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.070
Oh my God!

01:25:34.534 --> 01:25:35.706
Who is he, Victor?

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:39.774
Lie down

01:25:40.034 --> 01:25:41.570
Else your head
will get blown off

01:28:33.734 --> 01:28:34.542
Stop...stop

01:28:41.534 --> 01:28:43.673
Till now we have not got
both the bodies, sir

01:28:43.734 --> 01:28:46.578
- There is lot of under current
- Search the entire area

01:28:46.634 --> 01:28:49.706
Till you find the body
don't confirm the demise

01:29:12.167 --> 01:29:16.343
Anjali, I don't know what to tell you
It is not as you are thinking

01:29:16.401 --> 01:29:17.641
What should I think?

01:29:17.701 --> 01:29:21.581
With a lady and
that too with a gun in hand

01:29:25.001 --> 01:29:27.174
Listen to me, Anjali

01:29:30.101 --> 01:29:31.546
Please, don't go

01:29:31.601 --> 01:29:33.581
lfl go, will you shoot me too?

01:29:33.767 --> 01:29:37.510
- You are my wife
- But you shot at that lady's husband

01:29:39.167 --> 01:29:41.647
That is not her husband
He is no one

01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:43.043
It is he

01:29:43.101 --> 01:29:45.581
It is he who started to shoot first

01:29:47.167 --> 01:29:49.204
Don't talk like children childishly

01:29:49.267 --> 01:29:51.440
- Anjali, I want to tell you a truth
-What truth?

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:54.276
You are a rowdy
A gangster, isn't it that?

01:29:54.334 --> 01:29:57.315
If I go and ask in a police station,
I'll get that truth

01:29:57.367 --> 01:29:59.074
I'm not a gangster

01:29:59.667 --> 01:30:03.479
I'm an idiot wife who came to
know very late that husband...

01:30:03.534 --> 01:30:05.241
...is a criminal who carries along gun

01:30:05.301 --> 01:30:06.575
Isn't that what I'm, Jai?

01:30:08.167 --> 01:30:11.148
- What were you doing there?
- Is that a crime now?

01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:13.646
This is a free country
Anyone can appear anywhere

01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:16.704
Hey, tell me
How did you reach there?

01:30:16.767 --> 01:30:21.182
I followed you and came there
I was spying on you

01:30:28.467 --> 01:30:30.413
What my father told was right

01:30:31.301 --> 01:30:34.441
This was a mistake
Our marriage

01:30:53.667 --> 01:30:55.408

01:31:00.067 --> 01:31:02.069

01:32:49.067 --> 01:32:54.067
<i>tiff </i>

01:33:10.634 --> 01:33:16.016
"Without sleep coming
and embracing me..."

01:33:16.067 --> 01:33:20.982
"Without any sweet
dreams coming up"

01:33:21.067 --> 01:33:30.078
"The distance is increasing, dear"

01:33:30.767 --> 01:33:40.176
"Fate is disappearing far away"

01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:45.709
"Your image is appearing
in front of my eyes"

01:33:45.767 --> 01:33:50.773
"The time when reality
is taking you away"

01:33:51.001 --> 01:33:56.001
"Did the night say good bye by
murmuring in the ears of night flower?"

01:34:31.534 --> 01:34:36.574
"Without seeing together
in the same direction..."

01:34:36.667 --> 01:34:41.673
"We saw separately in
different directions"

01:34:41.767 --> 01:34:51.279
"The loneliness is
engulfing me, dear..."

01:34:51.500 --> 01:35:01.410
"Nowl can understand
what is love by myself..."

01:35:01.467 --> 01:35:06.746
"You are coming closer
and closer to me..."

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:11.579
"The time when anger
is melting away..."

01:35:11.767 --> 01:35:21.245
"Did the night say good bye by
murmuring in the ears of night flower?"

01:35:21.334 --> 01:35:31.051
"To burn as coal and to
disappear far away..."

01:35:31.301 --> 01:35:36.478
"The sunlight passed away
and darkness took over"

01:35:36.567 --> 01:35:42.176
"Eyes became wet
when you said goodbye"

01:35:42.234 --> 01:35:47.377
"This is the time
I realized what is pain"

01:36:02.201 --> 01:36:03.145
What?

01:36:06.001 --> 01:36:08.003
Did your wife leave you?

01:36:08.067 --> 01:36:10.308
The biggest problem is divorce...

01:36:10.367 --> 01:36:12.472
...is that we have to give
half the property, that's all

01:36:12.534 --> 01:36:14.275
She is my only property, sir

01:36:38.267 --> 01:36:40.338
We got both these
bodies yesterday night

01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:45.113
Keeping the face
we couldn't identify anything

01:36:48.067 --> 01:36:51.276
Sir, send both the bodies
for DNA test

01:36:51.334 --> 01:36:55.077
We can't believe blindly
Rana is too clever, sir

01:37:03.334 --> 01:37:05.974
Sir, we got Laila's phone from the car

01:37:06.034 --> 01:37:09.379
As it fell in water, the data recovery
is slightly difficult from that

01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:25.744
Laila, without you I won't
keep this party on 23rd

01:37:26.001 --> 01:37:28.345
Don't betray me, Please

01:37:34.667 --> 01:37:37.773
What important work you have
that you can't change the date?

01:37:40.101 --> 01:37:41.512
Date, with whom?

01:37:42.734 --> 01:37:44.680
- Who?
-Ayesha

01:37:44.734 --> 01:37:45.678
Ayes ha?

01:37:59.467 --> 01:38:01.640
Why not search Laila's flat, sir?

01:38:28.167 --> 01:38:31.705
- Jai, did you get anything?
- This is the clue

01:38:32.734 --> 01:38:35.681
The flashy lifestyle is only a show off

01:38:35.767 --> 01:38:39.305
After this got over she has mixed
water and has washed hair with this

01:38:39.367 --> 01:38:41.369
<i>See how much she has
squeezed 'Ms and used</i>

01:38:41.467 --> 01:38:43.140
Laila was only that much

01:39:22.033 --> 01:39:24.104
A concise life history

01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:27.579
Sorry, an autobiography
on a day to day basis

01:39:32.567 --> 01:39:38.540
On 23rd night a special programme
arranged by Rana for Laila

01:39:39.467 --> 01:39:44.974
College band friends of Rana who are
unknown to her are coming from Mumbai

01:39:45.067 --> 01:39:47.570
Then they will take
Laila to the venue

01:39:50.234 --> 01:39:56.617
Rana has made her believe that
the special event will change her life

01:40:13.567 --> 01:40:15.569
Both the voices felt familiar

01:40:15.667 --> 01:40:17.510
So we did a voice sample match

01:40:25.601 --> 01:40:27.774
Where did bloody Rana vanish?

01:40:28.001 --> 01:40:30.311
What is new about it?

01:40:30.367 --> 01:40:33.507
It is his habit to vanish
like this for weeks together

01:40:33.567 --> 01:40:36.707
But it is he who did the arrangements
for the birthday party

01:40:36.767 --> 01:40:40.738
Why do you worry, brother?
Whether Rana comes or not...

01:40:40.801 --> 01:40:44.078
...binhday will be surely celebrated
And the cake will also be cut

01:40:44.368 --> 01:40:47.747
Okay, I'll get the candles
You bring matches

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.138
Okay, brother

01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:50.736
This is Dilawar and Dhara

01:40:51.001 --> 01:40:53.743
The key players of
many of Rana's missions

01:40:57.667 --> 01:41:01.774
From this phone call it is clear that
Dhara is somewhere near this city

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.981
Sir, but we still don't know
what their plan of action is

01:41:05.300 --> 01:41:07.780
23rd Prime Minister's visit

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.741
The cricket match is
also on the same day

01:41:09.801 --> 01:41:14.045
From previous day till 3 days
Islamic peace conference

01:41:14.167 --> 01:41:16.704
There is no threatening
for Prime Minister's visit

01:41:17.434 --> 01:41:21.974
But cricket match and Islamic
peace conference can be targeted

01:41:22.034 --> 01:41:24.207
...according to intelligence repon

01:41:24.334 --> 01:41:26.712
After Rana and
Laila are dead

01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:30.179
Dilawar and Dhara must
have taken over this plan

01:41:33.267 --> 01:41:36.976
Among these three events on
whichever the attack may be...

01:41:37.067 --> 01:41:38.603
...our country will
have to feel sorry

01:41:38.667 --> 01:41:41.307
...and be put to shame
in front of Global community

01:41:41.367 --> 01:41:43.472
But Ayesha
Who the hell is she?

01:42:26.367 --> 01:42:29.143
I don't know what the problem
between you and my daughter is

01:42:30.067 --> 01:42:31.740
On asking she is not
saying anything

01:42:47.734 --> 01:42:50.237
Don't tell anyone
Don't put me to shame

01:43:29.767 --> 01:43:32.509
Are you not asking
where I'm taking you to?

01:43:32.567 --> 01:43:33.602
It must be to kill me

01:43:35.467 --> 01:43:37.777
May be you must have
forgotten your gun

01:43:38.001 --> 01:43:40.038
Then you can bang
the car and kill me

01:43:40.101 --> 01:43:42.138
It is not a long time
since we have got married

01:43:42.201 --> 01:43:44.374
It is not time to
feel like killing you

01:43:44.467 --> 01:43:47.607
Are you doing all
this act to impress me?

01:43:47.701 --> 01:43:50.147
I'm starting that only now

01:44:07.034 --> 01:44:08.775
What do you have to
prove now, Jai?

01:44:09.001 --> 01:44:11.140
Is it that you are a big
stunt man like in cinema?

01:44:11.234 --> 01:44:12.770
No, I'm a trained man for all this

01:44:13.034 --> 01:44:13.739
I'm an agent

01:44:14.201 --> 01:44:15.236
Agent?

01:44:15.334 --> 01:44:17.780
Is it an insurance agent
or travel agent?

01:44:18.734 --> 01:44:22.682
Okay, you must be
the goon of the agency...

01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:25.371
You'll shoot those
who don't take policy

01:44:25.434 --> 01:44:27.436
Else you'll drive over
the car and kill them

01:44:27.534 --> 01:44:29.104
Have you got training for that?

01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:39.073
Mumbai 26/11

01:44:39.167 --> 01:44:42.410
Do you remember
a terrorist attack like that?

01:44:43.467 --> 01:44:49.474
After one year to that shameful
act our country took a decision

01:44:49.601 --> 01:44:53.572
If we have to fight face to
face with terrorists...

01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:57.512
We need an intelligence
agency in our country

01:44:58.334 --> 01:45:04.080
In that no one or no agent should
reveal his identity to even his wife

01:45:04.167 --> 01:45:07.171
He shouldn't tell who he
is and what his job is

01:45:07.267 --> 01:45:11.579
Among those men who don't have
the rights to reveal their true identity...

01:45:11.634 --> 01:45:14.342
...I'm also one, that's me

01:45:17.267 --> 01:45:21.716
Our Deccan Exports company
which you and your father...

01:45:21.767 --> 01:45:25.715
...call as lousy is an
outer cover for that

01:45:28.034 --> 01:45:30.412
Now also you don't believe, isn't it?

01:46:09.067 --> 01:46:10.205
See there

01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:18.443
Sitting in this export company
we find out the terrorists...

01:46:18.534 --> 01:46:21.276
...who are imported here
by our enemy countries

01:46:21.334 --> 01:46:23.712
See monitoring terror activities

01:46:25.300 --> 01:46:26.506
Phone tapping

01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:32.141
Spy work
Like that many things

01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:43.771
They are the team
members working with me

01:46:45.534 --> 01:46:48.310
ls your wife back?

01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:55.680
So now do you understand that
this is not an export company?

01:46:55.801 --> 01:47:00.614
- We both are not-
- Sir, she can't understand Tamil

01:47:01.001 --> 01:47:04.414
- Is it so?
- Okay, look Anjali

01:47:05.334 --> 01:47:09.180
Do you know now what the commodities
that are traded in Deccan Exports are?

01:47:10.734 --> 01:47:15.240
Anjali, whatever you saw and heard here,
don't tell anyone outside

01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:18.076
What is my job? Who are they?
Not a word, okay?

01:47:20.067 --> 01:47:26.541
Sir, this innocent executive of
mine is a commando of this country

01:47:27.167 --> 01:47:29.477
I don't think anyone
will believe that after this

01:47:29.534 --> 01:47:32.538
What about you?
Do you believe me?

01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:56.046
Thanks you
Greetings

01:47:57.100 --> 01:47:59.376
- Where are you escaping?
- I'm not going anywhere

01:47:59.467 --> 01:48:04.473
Fool! In this agency even if a small
hint goes out, it is like a virus

01:48:04.534 --> 01:48:06.673
- Don't you have sense?
-What virus?

01:48:06.734 --> 01:48:08.645
Is it a joke for you?

01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:12.574
I'll shoot and put in fire
You and your wife

01:48:14.134 --> 01:48:16.546
- Go, man
- Thank you, sir

01:48:18.467 --> 01:48:19.969
Oh Prophet!

01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:24.206
In the room
why did your chief...

01:48:24.267 --> 01:48:27.407
...c:atch hold of your collar
and pointed gun at you?

01:48:27.467 --> 01:48:29.037
Is it for telling
everything to me?

01:48:29.134 --> 01:48:31.671
After bringing
your wife to my office...

01:48:31.734 --> 01:48:35.739
...why you didn't get her
even a tea, he asked

01:48:42.667 --> 01:48:44.738
- Is it that female?
- Come

01:48:48.067 --> 01:48:49.637
Jai, tell me the truth

01:48:49.734 --> 01:48:52.544
Has she really gone crazy
after you married me?

01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:55.342
After marrying you it is not her
but me who has gone crazy

01:48:58.434 --> 01:48:59.469
It is paining

01:48:59.534 --> 01:49:01.480
For that the chief caught
hold of your neck

01:49:01.534 --> 01:49:04.014
- Your father slapped me
-What? When?

01:49:04.067 --> 01:49:05.341
I don't remember
the correct time

01:49:05.434 --> 01:49:06.242
Did it really pain?

01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:08.439
For two hours there was
ringing sound in my ears

01:49:08.501 --> 01:49:12.108
It is good, the doctor had kept that
from many days for his son-in-law

01:49:12.533 --> 01:49:15.480
Jai, shall I say
sorry to son-in-law?

01:49:15.534 --> 01:49:17.980
- How?
- Like this

01:49:44.001 --> 01:49:46.072
Jai, have you murdered anyone?

01:49:46.167 --> 01:49:49.410
Yes, that was for the country...enemies

01:49:53.667 --> 01:49:54.645
I will see

01:50:00.601 --> 01:50:03.639
Jai, see who has come
Sir, please come inside

01:50:04.767 --> 01:50:05.575
Here

01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:23.648
I came here to talk about
a serious matter to you

01:50:23.701 --> 01:50:26.341
I know that you didn't
come here to drink tea

01:50:27.501 --> 01:50:29.777
That is...with you...

01:51:00.468 --> 01:51:05.076
For few hours you have
to become Laila, Anjali

01:51:07.267 --> 01:51:10.510
What is it?
One night...only night

01:51:10.567 --> 01:51:15.073
She must dress up like Laila
and sing and dance on stage

01:51:15.167 --> 01:51:18.444
Then the three musicians who
are going to come from Mumbai

01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:22.642
Those friends of Rana
Thinking as Laila they'll meet Anjali

01:51:30.634 --> 01:51:33.581
Sir, there are so many agents
and trained people in our team

01:51:34.634 --> 01:51:37.478
No one else can do
what she can

01:51:41.301 --> 01:51:44.510
None among our agents
have this much talent

01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:46.511
- Jai, this man-
- This man!

01:51:46.567 --> 01:51:50.413
Sorry, how does sir know
that I can sing and dance?

01:51:50.467 --> 01:51:53.448
See how nicely she is
talking Tamil like Laila

01:51:57.400 --> 01:52:00.609
Anjali has danced and
sung in college band

01:52:00.667 --> 01:52:04.410
Then in your Malayalee
Samajam she has performed

01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:07.140
I enquired everything about her

01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:10.409
I have put a detailed dossier
about her in this laptop

01:52:10.467 --> 01:52:11.241
See this

01:52:25.467 --> 01:52:28.141
Madam, your fate
is like that

01:52:28.234 --> 01:52:30.578
That is why you have got
such an opportunity

01:52:31.734 --> 01:52:35.204
Where and in what way there is a
resemblance between her and Laila?

01:52:35.267 --> 01:52:38.680
Now there is no resemblance but
resemblance will come with attitude

01:52:38.734 --> 01:52:40.771
- After she is trained
- Sir, she'll get nonsense

01:52:41.001 --> 01:52:42.207
Nonsense if you train her

01:52:42.267 --> 01:52:45.271
Now in any pan of my body if you
keep egg, it'll become bulls eye

01:52:45.334 --> 01:52:48.076
- Do you know that?
-I don't know and I don't care

01:52:53.401 --> 01:52:56.644
Now in this city a new terrorist
attack is going to take place

01:52:57.201 --> 01:52:59.704
Where? How? And when? It is not known

01:52:59.767 --> 01:53:02.247
We have no clue
But you know one thing?

01:53:02.334 --> 01:53:06.282
Whatever that Rana
planned is sure to take place

01:53:08.634 --> 01:53:12.707
- What other option is there?
- Sir, she is my wife

01:53:15.301 --> 01:53:17.110
What to do if there is
another attack?

01:53:17.167 --> 01:53:19.704
What to do? Tell me
They'll spit on the face

01:53:20.034 --> 01:53:23.038
On your face and on my face
Can we bear it?

01:53:23.167 --> 01:53:27.343
It'll be such a big shame?
Make her a pan of your team

01:53:27.434 --> 01:53:30.608
Include her in the operation
Include her too

01:53:31.068 --> 01:53:32.638
I'm asking this
for our Mother land

01:53:32.734 --> 01:53:33.769
Let's do this

01:53:43.301 --> 01:53:46.009
- Sir, I'll do this
-Anjali

01:53:47.701 --> 01:53:51.171
Let's do this, Jai
For our country's sake

01:53:51.568 --> 01:53:54.276
For my Jai's sake
I'll do it, sir

01:54:05.134 --> 01:54:09.708
"I'm the girl beautiful
who has come to charm you"

01:54:09.767 --> 01:54:14.273
"There is no one on this
earth to compete with me..."

01:54:32.501 --> 01:54:36.643
"I'm the girl beautiful
who has come to charm you"

01:54:36.701 --> 01:54:40.649
Jai, I can't behave like her
It is not possible for me

01:54:43.001 --> 01:54:45.675
Did you see, sir?
She saw Laila only once

01:54:45.734 --> 01:54:47.543
It is over
inferiority complex

01:54:47.634 --> 01:54:51.514
What? To whom? What complex

01:54:51.567 --> 01:54:53.672
To shake butt in front of men?

01:54:53.734 --> 01:54:54.439
Move

01:54:54.501 --> 01:54:57.209
Sir, girls like me who are born
into decent family can't do this

01:54:57.268 --> 01:54:59.612
That is the reason
Except that I have no complex

01:54:59.667 --> 01:55:02.739
It is not so easy to shake butt, Anjali

01:55:03.201 --> 01:55:04.009
That...

01:55:05.467 --> 01:55:08.311
You are the right person
to change her

01:55:22.167 --> 01:55:23.737
What happened?
Didn't you like it?

01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:26.280
From the back it looks
like an elephant is walking

01:55:26.334 --> 01:55:27.608
It is that good

01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:32.207
On Ramp you should
walk like models

01:55:32.267 --> 01:55:35.612
You must flow like feather
You must not look down

01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:37.711
You stop there
I'll show you

01:56:00.701 --> 01:56:05.047
Laila walk means the whole
action is in buttocks

01:56:06.034 --> 01:56:09.481
Chee! That means when
she walks, you stare only there

01:56:09.534 --> 01:56:10.342
Idiot!

01:56:12.334 --> 01:56:13.404
It is not possible for me

01:56:13.467 --> 01:56:15.310
Walk like that
Shake the buttocks like this

01:56:15.367 --> 01:56:18.075
You must be the first husband
in this world to be teaching...

01:56:18.134 --> 01:56:20.205
...your own wife to
shake buttocks like this

01:56:20.634 --> 01:56:24.741
The way you are ordering it sounds
as if a military man is teaching march past

01:56:26.034 --> 01:56:29.277
Look here, from tomorrow
I won't be teaching you

01:56:29.334 --> 01:56:31.473
I have found
an apt person to teach you

01:56:31.534 --> 01:56:32.444
Who is that?

01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:36.346
Afellow who is an expert in
Bollywood movies and beauty contest

01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:42.144
Orignal name Kuppu Samy
from Chennai

01:56:53.567 --> 01:56:55.274
What joke is this?

01:56:55.567 --> 01:56:59.777
Should I make this girl
like that girl? No way

01:57:00.001 --> 01:57:04.313
Can this cuckoo be made
like that peacock? Impossible

01:57:04.401 --> 01:57:08.008
Hey! Do I look like
cuckoo to you?

01:57:08.101 --> 01:57:10.513
You are talking too much
Do you know who I'm?

01:57:10.567 --> 01:57:11.739
Get lost

01:57:15.334 --> 01:57:18.577
You have 2 days time
to change her

01:57:18.634 --> 01:57:21.046
I'm telling you, sir

01:57:21.134 --> 01:57:24.707
Not two days, even if you give me 2 years,
this girl can't be made beautiful

01:57:24.801 --> 01:57:28.146
What am I telling you?
Can't you do it, Kuppu Samy?

01:57:28.234 --> 01:57:32.546
Sir, even if you beat me, hit me or
put me in jail, this can't be done

01:57:33.267 --> 01:57:35.042
Put him in lock up

01:57:36.634 --> 01:57:39.410
Where are you taking me?
Put me down

01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:43.346

his nerves he'll agree by himself

01:59:24.434 --> 01:59:25.504
No, Jai

lfl come on stage in Laila's attire,
that very minute people will know

01:59:31.401 --> 01:59:34.314
Everything will go
out of hand due to me

01:59:34.434 --> 01:59:37.574
Sometimes it is not possible
to convince all the viewers

01:59:37.634 --> 01:59:40.376
But you can confuse them

01:59:44.334 --> 01:59:46.041
That is enough
That will do

Whom are we expecting?
What is there plan?

02:02:58.067 --> 02:03:00.047
We know nothing about that

Sir, I'm going in

02:14:12.300 --> 02:14:13.370
Listen, Jai

02:14:13.467 --> 02:14:15.413
You take care
and be careful

02:15:49.734 --> 02:15:51.213
Ratan Mittal

02:16:20.367 --> 02:16:22.074
Drop your gun down

02:16:53.534 --> 02:16:55.480
Sir, Ratan Mittal is dead

02:16:57.066 --> 02:16:59.377
Even nowl don't know
where is Anjali

02:17:00.534 --> 02:17:03.071
Sir, they are ahead of us by one step

02:17:03.367 --> 02:17:06.177
They know,
that we are tracking them

02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:13.411
Welcome, MrJai Mohan

02:17:14.267 --> 02:17:16.770
Ratan Mittal changed his plan

02:17:17.034 --> 02:17:20.208
No birthday party and
no Laila performance

02:17:20.300 --> 02:17:22.576
So we punished him

02:17:23.368 --> 02:17:26.144
We improvised our plan a bit

02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:28.441
But we were expecting you

02:17:29.534 --> 02:17:31.275
Drop your gun down

02:17:31.367 --> 02:17:32.277
I said...

02:17:39.700 --> 02:17:41.201
Where is my wife?

02:17:43.634 --> 02:17:44.704
- Tell me
-No

02:17:44.767 --> 02:17:46.212
Where is my wife?

02:18:10.467 --> 02:18:12.777
Anjali, are you okay?

02:18:25.234 --> 02:18:28.977
- Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay, Jai

02:18:29.467 --> 02:18:31.105
To have brought you in this mission

02:18:31.166 --> 02:18:31.736
Let's go

02:18:31.799 --> 02:18:32.709
No

02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:34.712
- It is not that easy
-Why?

02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:49.469
My God!

02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:01.976
Sir, I found Anjali

02:19:03.799 --> 02:19:04.744
But

02:19:06.634 --> 02:19:07.737
What?

02:19:09.234 --> 02:19:10.212
Bomb!

02:19:10.300 --> 02:19:16.775
Sir, it is a acetone peroxide liquid
explosive, a simple cell phone detonator

02:19:17.367 --> 02:19:21.041
Asingle phone call is enough for
everything to explode and become ash

02:19:21.367 --> 02:19:23.710
With a number
programmed cellphone

02:19:24.034 --> 02:19:25.672
Someone somewhere is...

02:19:27.634 --> 02:19:29.442
What will we do now?

02:20:37.167 --> 02:20:40.239
Sahil, don't cut the cake
till we light the candles

02:20:40.334 --> 02:20:42.712
There is a delay
Just wait for my call

02:20:58.434 --> 02:21:01.005
The last call to this number

02:21:01.167 --> 02:21:04.307
Track the location of that number

02:21:06.334 --> 02:21:08.678
Track the last incoming
call to this number

02:21:12.334 --> 02:21:14.109
This may not be their target

02:21:14.201 --> 02:21:17.114
Laila and Ayesha
All are smoke screens

02:21:17.201 --> 02:21:21.115
To divert our
intelligence network's attention

02:21:21.334 --> 02:21:24.577
Mittal's birthday party
A hostage situation

02:21:24.634 --> 02:21:26.113
A bomb blast

02:21:27.034 --> 02:21:30.641
When all the attentions are
on this side, somewhere else...

02:21:30.734 --> 02:21:34.739
...a big trap will be created to
bring about a bigger disaster

02:21:35.034 --> 02:21:37.344
They must be making
the move for that

02:21:52.034 --> 02:21:54.173
How many people came
with you to this place?

02:21:55.534 --> 02:21:57.138
Four of them

02:21:57.234 --> 02:21:58.338
My God!

02:21:58.601 --> 02:21:59.636
Four?

02:22:01.034 --> 02:22:02.445
Then where is the 4th one?

02:22:14.401 --> 02:22:16.210
Come out

02:22:20.767 --> 02:22:22.178
- Security
- Sir

02:22:22.267 --> 02:22:24.042
ls sir in the house
or has he gone out?

02:22:24.134 --> 02:22:25.613
- Sir is inside
- Okay

02:22:29.234 --> 02:22:31.180
You are an excellent performer

02:22:36.067 --> 02:22:38.377
- Dilawar!
- Hi!

02:22:39.767 --> 02:22:41.644
- Come
- How are you?

02:22:44.534 --> 02:22:47.743
Dilawar, that Mittal spoilt everything

02:22:49.500 --> 02:22:52.003
Listen, try to make
him understand

02:22:52.100 --> 02:22:54.444
If he agrees, it is okay
Else you shoot him

02:22:55.667 --> 02:22:57.374
And kill the security guy too

02:22:57.434 --> 02:22:58.378
- Okay
- Go

02:22:58.433 --> 02:22:59.275
We'll meet

02:22:59.367 --> 02:23:00.539
Come inside

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.412
- Laila, come
-Yes, I'm coming

02:23:03.567 --> 02:23:05.171
Come...come

02:23:07.733 --> 02:23:09.041
Come on

02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:15.677
Sir, Anjali is with me

02:23:15.767 --> 02:23:17.110
She is safe

02:23:17.734 --> 02:23:21.113
Dilawar was there in
the van in which Anjali came

02:23:21.167 --> 02:23:23.704
He got down from that van
and boarded another car

02:23:23.767 --> 02:23:27.180
- Dhara is the driver of that car
- Dhara came in which car, Jai?

02:23:27.267 --> 02:23:30.612
Sir, that is a white
color Ford Ecos fort

02:23:30.734 --> 02:23:32.645
Any idea about the number?

02:23:33.134 --> 02:23:34.670
I'm sorry, sir
Anjali didn't notice...

02:23:34.767 --> 02:23:37.338
KA01 X83132

02:23:38.067 --> 02:23:41.207
- Sir, it is KA01 X83132
- Okay

02:23:41.267 --> 02:23:43.770
- Good
- Thank you

02:23:52.367 --> 02:23:53.971
Jai, that car has been spotted

02:23:54.067 --> 02:23:56.206
We have traced the incoming call too

02:23:56.301 --> 02:24:00.681
The phone call to that number came
from the mobile tower near the Airport

02:24:00.767 --> 02:24:03.976
The car in which Dhara came has
also been located only there

02:24:04.167 --> 02:24:06.647
In the industrial site near the runway

02:24:06.800 --> 02:24:10.304
And now even the local
police is searching there

02:24:12.067 --> 02:24:13.546
And one more thing, Jai

02:24:14.034 --> 02:24:17.140
We have identified the body
that was with Laila in that car

02:24:17.634 --> 02:24:19.773
A missing CISF officer

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.139
Ram Singh, Airport security wing

02:24:22.234 --> 02:24:25.113
Sir, I think I know what their plan is

02:24:29.367 --> 02:24:30.744
Anjali, come here

02:24:33.667 --> 02:24:35.738
Here, Anjali
Just open it

02:24:36.001 --> 02:24:39.278
You'll find an item in that
National VIP movement tracker

02:24:39.334 --> 02:24:41.075
- Click it
- Okay

02:24:43.134 --> 02:24:46.547
- Jai, password
-Your name Anjali

02:24:56.367 --> 02:24:58.472
It is a security system showing...

02:24:58.534 --> 02:25:01.481
...National and foreign VIP's
programme and travel plans

02:25:01.534 --> 02:25:02.342
Check it

02:25:02.401 --> 02:25:04.108
On updating airport log in...

02:25:04.167 --> 02:25:07.307
...you'll get change of plan
rescheduling, delays, anything

02:25:22.334 --> 02:25:24.678
The flight of the former
US President who is coming...

02:25:24.733 --> 02:25:27.339
...to Bangalore to take pan
in the US Summit is delayed

02:25:27.400 --> 02:25:28.504
Yes

02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:30.136
That is the target

02:25:30.267 --> 02:25:32.213
Former US President

02:25:32.701 --> 02:25:33.975
What?

02:25:34.734 --> 02:25:37.681
- Former US President!
-Yes, sir

02:25:37.801 --> 02:25:40.441
Jai, flight is landing
at 7:30 in the morning

02:25:40.500 --> 02:25:43.276
Sir, you move to the airport
I'm on my way

02:25:43.334 --> 02:25:44.506
okay

02:25:46.434 --> 02:25:49.711
But who'll be benefited by
killing a former president?

02:25:49.801 --> 02:25:52.281
High profile causality
News coverage

02:25:52.367 --> 02:25:54.074
That sensation will remain...

02:25:54.133 --> 02:25:56.636
...as a highlight for days
together in media all over the world

02:25:56.700 --> 02:25:58.338
That is what they want
Come on

02:26:03.100 --> 02:26:07.173
Anjali, if you had not been there,
this mission won't have reached anywhere

02:26:07.234 --> 02:26:09.544
Thank you, dear
Thank you for everything

02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:11.045

02:26:11.134 --> 02:26:12.670

02:26:12.767 --> 02:26:14.075
Jai, I'm not going anywhere

02:26:14.134 --> 02:26:15.340
I'll remain with you

02:26:15.401 --> 02:26:17.745
Listen I can't play anymore
keeping your life at stake

02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:19.279
But Jai, we are a team

02:26:19.333 --> 02:26:21.677
Okay, in that case
you must obey orders

02:26:21.734 --> 02:26:23.407

02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:35.371

There is no use of killing me

02:37:55.434 --> 02:37:57.744
If I'm unable to finish
this mission...

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:01.709
...someone else will complete
this mission inside the airport

02:38:02.801 --> 02:38:07.113

As you know that the body found with
Laila is that of a CISF officer

02:38:25.367 --> 02:38:28.075

There is no use of killing me

02:39:23.667 --> 02:39:26.341
If not me someone else
will finish this mission

02:39:26.467 --> 02:39:29.641
That is my problem
You go to hell

02:39:35.034 --> 02:39:36.479

02:41:02.100 --> 02:41:03.602
I slept off

02:41:08.767 --> 02:41:10.246
Are you okay?

02:41:10.334 --> 02:41:11.745
In the sleep I saw a dream

02:41:11.801 --> 02:41:13.974
- Laila
- Laila?

02:41:14.033 --> 02:41:15.376

Why did you call on Anjali's phone?
