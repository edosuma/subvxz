<i>Megatron has managed to
accomplish the first phase of</i>

00:21.993 --> 00:27.171
<i>his cyberforming of Earth ...
the construction of his fortress.</i>

00:27.240 --> 00:30.542
In Jasper, Nevada?
I don't get it. Why here?

00:32.214 --> 00:36.921
Because the Decepticons have
discovered the location of our base.

00:36.990 --> 00:40.425
Come, my armada, attack!

00:42.897 --> 00:47.432
The base is lost. We must
disperse to avoid capture.

00:47.501 --> 00:50.001
Special Agent Fowler to
Air Defense Command.

00:50.070 --> 00:54.005
- I need immediate combat support.
- No.

01:11.197 --> 01:17.171
- Leave no stone unturned.
- Master, look who we found,

01:17.239 --> 01:21.609
pulled from the wreckage
of his ship ... Wheeljack.

01:23.747 --> 01:29.685
So, one survived.
Take our guest back to the

01:29.754 --> 01:34.724
citadel for questioning.
Back to Darkmount.

01:42.567 --> 01:49.639
This is the dawning of a new age,
my liege ... the reign of Megatron.

01:49.708 --> 01:53.509
You do have a way with words,
Starscream.

01:53.578 --> 01:57.846
<i>Make haste and unearth the
Autobot corpses.</i>

03:11.414 --> 03:14.174
The Forge of Solus Prime?!

03:14.244 --> 03:17.364
How is it that you have
managed to materialize that

03:17.364 --> 03:20.484
yet not the remains
of a single Autobot?!

03:20.554 --> 03:25.054
Answer your Lord and master.
Where are their bodies?!

03:39.977 --> 03:43.947
You're hurt, but you probably
look way worse than you feel.

03:46.917 --> 03:49.887
No, don't move or talk.
Just power down.

03:49.957 --> 03:53.757
Get your strength back.
I got you covered.

03:54.127 --> 03:56.977
<i>The Autobots clearly
ground bridged from their base</i>

03:57.040 --> 04:01.800
<i>before it was destroyed.
They could be anywhere.</i>

04:01.860 --> 04:05.170
We must initiate global
surveillance, my Lord.

04:05.230 --> 04:10.400
Send search-and-destroy teams
to every sector of this planet.

04:10.470 --> 04:14.800
Soundwave, monitor all
Earth-based transmissions

04:14.800 --> 04:17.690
for any sign of Autobot
communication ...

04:17.690 --> 04:21.510
with each other or with
their human counterparts.

04:21.579 --> 04:23.653
Master...

04:34.933 --> 04:39.593
Mm. Foolish humans.
I shall deploy the armada.

04:39.663 --> 04:43.563
That won't be necessary,
Starscream, not when we can

04:43.633 --> 04:48.406
engage our enemy
with newfound might.

05:55.872 --> 05:59.612
<i>A new power dominates your world.</i>

05:59.682 --> 06:04.445
Any further attempts to attack me
will be met with even greater force.

06:04.515 --> 06:09.455
Your leaders should be advised
that my fusion cannons possess

06:09.525 --> 06:12.555
enough firepower to decimate any

06:12.555 --> 06:15.595
densely populated area of my choosing.

06:15.655 --> 06:20.695
<i>I would, in all likelihood, set sights
on your nation's capital, for starters.</i>

06:20.765 --> 06:22.995
Point taken.
Now, what do you want from us?

06:23.065 --> 06:25.365
<i>Nothing, Agent Fowler.</i>

06:25.435 --> 06:29.038
<i>The Decepticons mean
no harm to humanity.</i>

06:29.108 --> 06:31.938
We merely desire a place to call home.

06:32.008 --> 06:35.348
<i>No offense, Megatron, but I'm having
a tough time swallowing all this...</i>

06:35.418 --> 06:39.218
since you seem so bent on plastering
humankind under molten steel.

06:39.288 --> 06:42.988
Agent Fowler...
I admit that war brings out the

06:43.058 --> 06:47.158
worst in me, but the conflict
with the Autobots is now over,

06:47.228 --> 06:51.398
and our quarrel has never been
with your kind.

06:51.465 --> 06:55.801
Now that the one, true enemy of
the Decepticons is no more,

06:55.871 --> 06:59.641
my only wish is to
coexist on this planet

06:59.641 --> 07:03.411
with the human race, peacefully.

07:03.481 --> 07:05.211
<i>Together, Agent Fowler,</i>

07:05.281 --> 07:08.981
<i>I believe that you and I can make
that dream a reality.</i>

07:15.721 --> 07:18.854
You, too, have a way with
words, master.

07:18.924 --> 07:21.894
I almost believed you myself.

07:24.664 --> 07:26.494
Earth is our planet now,

07:26.564 --> 07:30.704
Starscream, and we shall finish
what we started.

07:30.774 --> 07:37.574
Humankind has no idea
what lies ahead for them.

07:43.003 --> 07:45.506
<i>Yes, General Bryce.
Special containment protocol </i>

07:45.506 --> 07:48.857
<i>G-1000 has been executed as planned.</i>

07:48.927 --> 07:52.197
Evacuation of Jasper, Nevada,
was 100% successful.

07:52.267 --> 07:55.437
As far as its citizens or the
media are concerned, the threat

07:55.497 --> 07:59.087
was a meteor shower and the
town is to remain quarantined

07:59.087 --> 08:02.677
until the resulting radiation
levels can be dissipated.

08:02.737 --> 08:06.177
Sir, any form of retaliation
would be too risky.

08:06.245 --> 08:08.810
I just need more time.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.980
Yes, I understand.

08:18.490 --> 08:21.190
Agent Fowler, those medical
supplies still haven't arrived.

08:21.260 --> 08:22.620
We have wounded men who need ...

08:22.690 --> 08:25.830
I'm doing the best I can,
nurse Darby.

08:25.900 --> 08:28.200
I've been a little busy juggling
a bunch of nuke-happy generals

08:28.260 --> 08:31.169
who don't seem to care if they
blow Nevada sky-high

08:31.226 --> 08:33.683
and a Decepticon warlord
who wants to make nice

08:33.683 --> 08:36.203
now that the Autobots
are in the scrapyard ...

08:36.273 --> 08:38.342
Megatron's opinion, not mine.

08:38.403 --> 08:42.513
He's feeding me a load of horse
pucky, trying to crush our spirit.

08:42.582 --> 08:47.683
Still no word from anyone?

08:49.753 --> 08:53.083
Listen, no contact only tells
me that the main comm link went

08:53.153 --> 08:55.993
down when the base was
pounded into pancake batter.

08:56.063 --> 08:57.956
But if I could just call Jack...

08:58.026 --> 09:00.866
You know it's too risky.
So do the bots.

09:00.926 --> 09:03.436
The Cons could trace any
cellphone signal.

09:03.496 --> 09:04.766
Then take me home.

09:04.836 --> 09:07.766
If Jack can't call, that's
where he'll look for me.

09:07.836 --> 09:10.306
Jasper's under
complete comm lockdown.

09:10.376 --> 09:11.736
Nobody's getting back in there.

09:11.806 --> 09:14.746
The only ones who can fix this
mess are Prime and his bots.

09:14.816 --> 09:19.036
I'm sure they're out there
keeping a low profile.

09:19.336 --> 09:20.846
They got to be.

09:24.819 --> 09:25.819
<i>Scanning.</i>

09:31.899 --> 09:34.629
<i>Negative.
No Autobot recognition.</i>

09:47.772 --> 09:51.812
Clear.

09:54.852 --> 09:59.052
Too close. But your
paint job did the trick.

10:03.532 --> 10:06.162
The comm sub link is still down.

10:06.232 --> 10:08.862
Bee, I realize Optimus sent us
all to different locations to

10:09.032 --> 10:12.178
make us harder for the Cons to
find, but if we don't know where

10:12.341 --> 10:15.435
in the world anyone else went,
how are we gonna find them?

10:19.275 --> 10:22.325
Right. Just keep
heading toward Jasper...

10:22.325 --> 10:25.385
toward Megatron's giant fortress.

10:30.825 --> 10:35.495
I never knew
there were so many rockies.

10:40.798 --> 10:41.868
<i>Miko!</i>

10:41.928 --> 10:44.798
Whoa!

10:44.868 --> 10:47.498
<i>No cellphone!
You know the rules.</i>

10:47.568 --> 10:49.648
Dude, I wasn't calling anyone,

10:49.648 --> 10:52.778
just playing a video
game I already downloaded.

10:52.838 --> 10:56.578
<i>Sorry.
I guess I'm a little on edge. </i>

10:59.778 --> 11:03.181
Where are we headed anyway, Bulk?
You got some sort of plan?

11:03.251 --> 11:05.721
<i>We're following standard
Wrecker protocol.</i>

11:05.791 --> 11:08.761
<i>- Which is...
- An emergency plan we followed</i>

11:08.821 --> 11:12.461
<i>during the war in case any Wrecker got
stranded or separated from the unit.</i>

11:12.531 --> 11:15.531
<i>We'd always rendezvous at the
exact same set of coordinates.</i>

11:15.601 --> 11:19.601
<i>If Jack is still alive, he'll be there.</i>

11:24.771 --> 11:29.244
Don't stop now.
I was just beginning to enjoy myself.

11:30.714 --> 11:35.284
Believe me, Wheeljack, there is
more where that came from.

11:35.354 --> 11:39.824
And you will tell me the
location of your compatriots...

11:41.824 --> 11:45.824
...no matter what
it takes or how long.

11:45.894 --> 11:49.634
Like I told you, they
weren't expecting me.

11:49.704 --> 11:52.149
They never bothered to fill me in.

11:52.217 --> 11:56.277
So, go ahead.
Knock yourself out.

12:05.017 --> 12:09.957
<i>How may I serve you,
Lord Megatron?</i>

12:10.027 --> 12:14.087
Assemble a team and disembark
for Cybertron immediately.

12:14.157 --> 12:18.600
While hunting Autobots remains
paramount, we must not squander

12:18.670 --> 12:23.600
the opportunity to recover any Iacon
relics left behind in the chaos.

12:23.670 --> 12:26.700
For all we know, Optimus Prime

12:26.770 --> 12:32.340
is out there somewhere,
planning to do the same.

12:35.980 --> 12:39.980
I-It's okay, Optimus.
You're with me ... Smokescreen.

12:41.486 --> 12:43.983
How did ... I get here?

12:44.053 --> 12:48.993
When we were evacuating the
base, just as the Cons opened fire...

12:50.263 --> 12:53.263
<i>It was my turn to ground bridge away.</i>

13:02.803 --> 13:04.043
<i>But I couldn't do it.</i>

13:04.113 --> 13:09.976
<i>I couldn't let you face
Megatron's army alone.</i>

13:10.046 --> 13:15.216
<i>So, I snuck back.</i>

13:15.286 --> 13:19.926
<i>But that's when the blast hit, and
the whole joint came tumbling down.</i>

13:26.436 --> 13:29.066
<i>But I managed to pull you from
the wreckage before the Cons</i>

13:29.136 --> 13:33.309
dove in, using the Phase
Shifter, which I... managed to

13:33.369 --> 13:37.079
snag in all the confusion back
on Cybertron.

13:37.139 --> 13:41.849
I'm ...
I'm sorry I defied your orders.

13:41.919 --> 13:45.989
We're safe here, but we're down so
deep, no one can pick up our signals.

13:46.049 --> 13:47.119
I'll have to scout above ground

13:47.189 --> 13:49.359
if I'm gonna have any hope of
finding Ratchet.

13:49.419 --> 13:54.189
No.
No hope.

13:54.259 --> 13:55.229
What do you mean?

13:55.298 --> 14:00.332
The Doc's the only one
who can get you patched up.

14:01.402 --> 14:03.272
Optimus.

14:10.912 --> 14:13.612
What if Jasper wasn't
evacuated in time?

14:13.682 --> 14:16.342
She could have been hurt or
taken by the Cons.

14:16.412 --> 14:18.182
- Jack...
- And even if she did get out,

14:18.252 --> 14:21.387
she's got to be worried out of
her mind not knowing where I am.

14:21.455 --> 14:26.085
Jack, calm down.
We'll get back to Jasper, find

14:26.155 --> 14:31.325
a way to reach your mother
and the rest of the team.

14:34.835 --> 14:41.735
Stay here.
Could be a Con on our tail.

14:48.918 --> 14:54.288
Sorry, mom.
I'd call if I could.

14:54.358 --> 14:56.918
Oh, one text couldn't hurt, could it?

15:03.968 --> 15:09.138
- Master.
- Send in the troops.

15:09.198 --> 15:13.671
And, Soundwave, I want a live feed.

15:31.891 --> 15:38.194
Jack.
"With Arcee. Safe. Love you."

15:38.264 --> 15:40.694
Agent Fowler, Jack's alive!

15:49.974 --> 15:51.404
Scrap.

16:14.342 --> 16:15.327
Civilian.

16:17.937 --> 16:19.997
Jack!

16:28.010 --> 16:30.280
I am so toast.

16:57.843 --> 17:01.643
<i>Smile, Jack.
You're on Decepticon TV.</i>

17:05.113 --> 17:09.583
Master.
We have a visual.

17:54.629 --> 18:00.109
How long does it take to exterminate
a lone Autobot and her human pet?!

18:00.179 --> 18:02.179
Well, in my experience ...

18:02.239 --> 18:06.045
- Not a riddle, Starscream.
- Sorry.

18:09.112 --> 18:10.652
<i>Over there.</i>

18:17.392 --> 18:20.892
- Not the best cover.
- We're not here to hide.

18:30.128 --> 18:33.975
Hey, guys.
Unleaded or diesel?

19:03.638 --> 19:06.838
Let's roll before they send
reinforcements.

19:26.361 --> 19:29.601
Come on, fellas.
Put your backs into it.

19:38.241 --> 19:43.641
The Apex armor.
Our illustrious leader will be pleased.

19:43.711 --> 19:50.254
Now, any sign of that Phase Shifter?
I really liked that thing.

19:50.324 --> 19:54.924
- Sir.
- By the Allspark.

20:05.034 --> 20:10.675
Well? Did any of the
surveillance data survive?

20:11.468 --> 20:13.477
A shame.
We might have at least learned

20:13.547 --> 20:16.577
the direction in which
Arcee and the human fled.

20:16.647 --> 20:21.287
Clearly, we need to improve
our methods of hunting Autobots

20:21.357 --> 20:25.657
and build upon the tactical advantage
that we've managed to secure.

20:25.727 --> 20:29.727
<i>Lord Megatron, I am ready to
return to Darkmount, and I'm</i>

20:29.797 --> 20:32.737
<i>certain you'll want to see what
I've uncovered.</i>

20:32.797 --> 20:37.401
Soundwave,
open a space-bridge portal.

20:48.920 --> 20:54.120
I find myself in urgent need of
good news, so please, Knockout,

20:54.190 --> 20:57.090
tell me that you found something useful.

20:57.160 --> 21:04.163
Some things, my liege.
And someone.

21:13.203 --> 21:15.113
<i>He... lives?</i>

21:16.973 --> 21:20.483
Shockwave.

21:21.553 --> 21:25.848
Just the tactical advantage I need.
