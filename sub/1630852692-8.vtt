WEBVTT

00:06.841 --> 00:12.513
Light and mercy,
cleanse the soul.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.598
Light and mercy,

00:14.598 --> 00:16.767
cleanse the soul.

00:16.767 --> 00:19.395
Light and mercy,
cleanse the soul.

00:26.819 --> 00:30.406
Everlight...

00:30.406 --> 00:32.533
I need your guidance.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.911
Where are you?

00:37.163 --> 00:38.914
No!

00:49.592 --> 00:51.635
No!

00:56.849 --> 00:59.185
The darkness
lingers still.

00:59.185 --> 01:01.854
We'll try this again
in a few hours,

01:01.854 --> 01:03.856
when you've regained
your strength.

01:03.856 --> 01:05.191
No.

01:05.191 --> 01:06.984
I'll try again now.

01:06.984 --> 01:09.445
It's too dangerous,
Pike Trickfoot.

01:09.445 --> 01:12.239
Do not indulge madness
out of desperation.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.784
This chamber is a conduit

01:14.784 --> 01:18.329
for more energy
than any one person can channel.

01:18.329 --> 01:20.247
Especially one
for whom the connection

01:20.247 --> 01:22.666
to the Everlight is...
questionable.

01:24.627 --> 01:26.462
If you won't aid me,

01:26.462 --> 01:28.756
then I'll do it alone.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.758
Leave me.

01:38.516 --> 01:41.227
Once more.

02:55.384 --> 02:56.969
Cass!

02:56.969 --> 02:58.429
Stay with me.

02:58.429 --> 03:00.055
I've wanted

03:00.055 --> 03:02.057
to do that for longer

03:02.057 --> 03:04.059
than you can imagine.

03:06.937 --> 03:08.314
Keyleth, hurry!

03:08.314 --> 03:09.815
Vax!

03:09.815 --> 03:11.609
I need Wanderer's Moss,
Flicksilver

03:11.609 --> 03:13.944
and, uh...
the bag that says "dirt."

03:13.944 --> 03:16.113
Need pressure on the wound
before the spell can hold.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.282
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.289
Okay.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.876
You can do this.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.305
Oh, the joy in watching

03:41.305 --> 03:44.099
a de Rolo child meet
a painful end.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.018
Cheers.

03:46.018 --> 03:48.020
You son of a bitch!

03:48.020 --> 03:51.690
We're all sons of bitches,
de Rolo.

03:51.690 --> 03:54.610
You in particular,
from that bitch

03:54.610 --> 03:55.945
who bore you.

04:00.282 --> 04:01.909
Aw!

04:01.909 --> 04:04.119
Did I poke a sore spot?

04:04.119 --> 04:06.789
You didn't know
your parents like I did.

04:06.789 --> 04:09.667
They took every opportunity
to keep an intellect

04:09.667 --> 04:11.961
like mine nose-down

04:11.961 --> 04:14.254
in the dirt, tutoring their...

04:14.254 --> 04:17.216
misbegotten spawn.

04:28.227 --> 04:30.187
Unlike you de Rolos,

04:30.187 --> 04:33.482
the Briarwoods see me
for a greater purpose.

04:33.482 --> 04:36.652
And for my efforts,
they have given me a great many

04:36.652 --> 04:39.321
rewards.

04:39.321 --> 04:42.950
Rise, armor of old
and greet our guests.

04:50.666 --> 04:52.292
No.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.884
My turn.

05:04.430 --> 05:07.099
Damn.

05:07.099 --> 05:08.517
Oi! Heads up!

05:10.561 --> 05:12.312
This revenge is mine.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.647
Not if you're dead.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.649
We're in this shit together.

05:19.111 --> 05:22.156
This will teach you
not to shoot my friends!

05:22.156 --> 05:24.033
Pin the bitch down!

05:27.119 --> 05:28.412
Shite!

05:28.412 --> 05:29.872
You're unbelievable.

05:29.872 --> 05:31.790
I know. It's annoying, isn't it?

05:31.790 --> 05:33.959
I realize it's
a long shot, but...

05:33.959 --> 05:36.170
any chance for a private lesson?

05:43.552 --> 05:45.345
Not that long of a shot, really.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.473
Uh, if you're
not dead down there,

05:47.473 --> 05:49.683
we could use some help!

05:56.482 --> 06:00.069
You and you,
on the white-haired one.

06:03.822 --> 06:06.784
Right, um, which one can I kill?

06:06.784 --> 06:08.327
Literally anyone.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.539
Aw, come on, come on.
Work for me.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.041
Okay, come on. Come on.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.543
Please work.

06:28.597 --> 06:30.516
Cassandra?

06:30.516 --> 06:32.601
Cassandra, can you hear me?

06:32.601 --> 06:34.937
No... No.

06:41.777 --> 06:44.238
Sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to--

06:44.238 --> 06:46.115
I'm, I'm Keyleth, I'm...

06:46.115 --> 06:47.991
sort of friends
with Percy, and, um,

06:47.991 --> 06:51.120
uh, forget it-- you're alive!
Just wait here!

07:03.048 --> 07:05.050
Not even a scratch?

07:06.343 --> 07:08.804
That's one! That's three!

07:08.804 --> 07:10.430
That's 11!

07:11.723 --> 07:14.226
All the letters!

07:19.398 --> 07:22.776
As much as I loathed
having to teach you,

07:22.776 --> 07:26.405
I'll relish watching you
skinned alive.

07:38.709 --> 07:41.253
The slats!

07:58.228 --> 08:00.397
Having trouble there, Grog?

08:00.397 --> 08:02.191
Because it looks
like you're having trouble.

08:02.191 --> 08:03.901
Don't you do nothin'.

08:03.901 --> 08:06.111
Don't get mad, big guy.

08:06.111 --> 08:09.072
Don't tell me what to do,
smaller guy!

08:13.911 --> 08:16.371
I hate your face so much.

08:16.371 --> 08:18.290
And you.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.500
You look like you need killing.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.336
How would you like to kill

08:22.336 --> 08:24.546
your friends for me?

08:24.546 --> 08:26.131
For me...

08:26.131 --> 08:28.592
Huh?

08:31.803 --> 08:34.389
At your command.

08:34.389 --> 08:36.183
He wouldn't.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.977
Kill Vox Machina.

08:38.977 --> 08:41.355
Uh, Grog, what are you--

08:55.953 --> 08:57.621
Delilah?

08:57.621 --> 09:00.415
No!

09:10.467 --> 09:11.635
Pike!

09:11.635 --> 09:13.220
Can you hear us?

09:13.220 --> 09:15.806
You must stop!

09:19.476 --> 09:22.354
I can't go.

09:22.354 --> 09:24.690
I won't go.

09:24.690 --> 09:26.275
No!

09:26.275 --> 09:28.277
Not without...

09:28.277 --> 09:30.570
an answer!

09:30.570 --> 09:32.948
No!

09:32.948 --> 09:35.951
Please! Everlight!

09:54.386 --> 09:56.638
You heard me?

09:56.638 --> 09:58.682
Thank you.

09:58.682 --> 10:01.643
I-I was trying so hard
to find you.

10:02.644 --> 10:04.855
Everlight?

10:04.855 --> 10:07.399
Is that really you?

10:10.027 --> 10:11.903
Speak, child.

10:11.903 --> 10:13.655
Who are you?

10:13.655 --> 10:16.700
I'm... lost.

10:16.700 --> 10:19.536
I-I tried to live up
to your standards.

10:19.536 --> 10:21.496
To-to be a steward
of your faith.

10:21.496 --> 10:23.623
But I... I failed.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.585
I need to find my way
back to your light.

10:27.794 --> 10:31.048
Lies will not lead you back.

10:31.048 --> 10:32.257
I'm...

10:32.257 --> 10:33.925
I-I'm not lying,

10:33.925 --> 10:36.595
I...

10:42.934 --> 10:45.937
If I'd known how much
fun this was going to be...

10:45.937 --> 10:48.273
...I'd have
possessed this lummox

10:48.273 --> 10:51.693
and made him
rip you apart right away.

10:54.738 --> 10:57.032
Please, Grog!

10:57.032 --> 10:59.242
We're your friends, remember?

10:59.242 --> 11:00.494
We love--

11:00.494 --> 11:02.496
Stay out of his range.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.706
There's no reasoning
with him while he's charmed.

11:04.706 --> 11:07.501
Or, you know, ever.

11:10.212 --> 11:11.713
We have to disarm him.

11:12.881 --> 11:15.050
You go high, I'll go low.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.030
Yes.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.865
Don't stop now,

11:38.865 --> 11:41.827
you giant half-wit.

11:41.827 --> 11:43.787
Didn't want to have to do
this to you, but...

11:56.258 --> 11:57.968
The fuck?

11:57.968 --> 12:00.387
Why is he only after me?!
Oh, gods!

12:00.387 --> 12:02.139
Faster! Kill them faster!

12:04.307 --> 12:05.934
We can't stop Grog,

12:05.934 --> 12:07.853
so let's stop
wasting our time on him.

12:08.979 --> 12:11.940
Enough of this.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.942
Vex?

12:15.944 --> 12:18.655
If the dumb one can't
complete my task, there are

12:18.655 --> 12:21.324
many more resources
at my disposal.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.872
Pay attention, de Rolo.

12:26.872 --> 12:28.373
I want you to know how you died.

12:28.373 --> 12:31.042
And who did it to you.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.044
Your friends.

12:45.599 --> 12:48.393
No escape
this time, welp.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.228
I owe you an apology, Professor.

12:50.228 --> 12:53.440
You're right-- the de Rolos
treated you poorly.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.276
My parents never recognized
my potential and clearly

12:56.276 --> 12:57.903
missed yours as well.

12:57.903 --> 13:01.823
A talented mind needs time
to cultivate, to think,

13:01.823 --> 13:03.867
to work out all the angles.

13:03.867 --> 13:05.785
Nice try, de Rolo.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.622
But flattery will not
prolong your life.

13:08.622 --> 13:12.501
And yet, it bought me
all the time I needed.

13:40.862 --> 13:43.073
- What...
- The fuck?

13:43.073 --> 13:44.616
Get it, I guess?

13:44.616 --> 13:47.410
Oh, look at it go.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.502
Got it.

14:02.092 --> 14:04.094
We trusted you.

14:04.094 --> 14:05.720
You were our teacher.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.473
We would've done
anything you asked.

14:10.475 --> 14:13.562
And you betrayed us
when we needed you most.

14:13.562 --> 14:17.649
You're the face I saw
when murder entered my heart.

14:17.649 --> 14:19.150
Guys, the smoke!

14:33.123 --> 14:34.958
Percy?

14:45.218 --> 14:46.720
Are you all right?

14:46.720 --> 14:48.597
I think she's going to be okay.

14:50.265 --> 14:52.559
Come on, clear the house.

14:52.559 --> 14:55.145
Look for anything useful,
and make it quick.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.816
When we escaped, I saw you fall.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.110
I thought you were dead.

15:02.110 --> 15:04.988
And I thought
you'd come back to check.

15:06.615 --> 15:08.491
The Briarwoods.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.452
They kept you alive?

15:10.452 --> 15:11.995
Of course they did.

15:11.995 --> 15:14.122
They had use for me.

15:14.122 --> 15:16.166
Parading me
in front of Whitestone.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.126
Loyal and loving.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.879
But I've been using them, too.

15:20.879 --> 15:23.798
Feeding information
to the resistance.

15:23.798 --> 15:26.051
You must have wanted to escape.

15:27.385 --> 15:29.888
Running away was never
my strong suit.

15:31.306 --> 15:33.183
We don't need to anymore.

15:33.183 --> 15:34.934
We're together.

15:44.069 --> 15:46.488
Apparently Anders' only

15:46.488 --> 15:48.448
valuable possession was
in his mouth.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.743
However, I did find this.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.622
Oh! Hey, is this

15:55.622 --> 15:57.832
one of them connect-a-dots?

15:57.832 --> 15:59.793
It's a star chart, Grog.

15:59.793 --> 16:02.962
These symbols show the sky
at a specific time and date.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.131
The solstice.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.883
That's five days from now.

16:06.883 --> 16:08.760
Why would they have this?

16:08.760 --> 16:10.553
We need to signal Archie.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.847
Let him know
that Cassandra is safe.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.561
I might have something for that.

16:23.066 --> 16:25.068
I've always wanted to try this.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.004
Kind of terrified.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.006
Kind of impressed.

17:12.073 --> 17:14.284
Where's my steward?!

17:14.284 --> 17:16.828
I-I'm sorry, Lady Briarwood.

17:16.828 --> 17:18.663
Did you need me
to bring you something?

17:18.663 --> 17:20.331
You already have.

17:37.932 --> 17:40.643
Delilah, what are you doing?

17:40.643 --> 17:42.187
Protecting you.

17:48.818 --> 17:52.322
<i>Dreezala kruum.</i>

17:52.322 --> 17:55.867
<i>Venz-shi-thradi.</i>

17:55.867 --> 17:58.244
<i>Dwem rastathek.</i>

17:58.244 --> 18:01.790
<i>Oshem Sutreeporvas!</i>

18:28.233 --> 18:30.193
We've done
all we can do for her.

18:30.193 --> 18:32.111
She's too far gone.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.155
If Pike is to return
to this plane,

18:34.155 --> 18:36.115
she'll have
to find her own way back.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.159
And if she doesn't?

18:38.159 --> 18:41.079
Then her body will be
but an empty shell.

18:44.249 --> 18:46.918
The flames will burn away
your falsehoods

18:46.918 --> 18:50.171
and reveal the truth.

18:50.171 --> 18:53.216
I'm not lying to you, I swear!

18:53.216 --> 18:55.552
Not to me, little one.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.350
To yourself.

19:08.606 --> 19:11.276
The truth?

19:11.276 --> 19:14.320
The truth is... I...

19:14.320 --> 19:17.574
I left the righteous path.

19:17.574 --> 19:21.202
I was drawn
to depravity and violence.

19:21.202 --> 19:23.997
When I'm with my friends,
we-we mix it up.

19:23.997 --> 19:27.083
And we drink,
we fight and curse and...

19:27.083 --> 19:29.210
I love it.

19:29.210 --> 19:31.796
But I know it's wrong.

19:31.796 --> 19:34.799
Why do you think it's wrong?

19:34.799 --> 19:37.385
Because I put them before you.

19:37.385 --> 19:40.138
I mean, they're why you cut off

19:40.138 --> 19:42.640
my connection to your light.

19:45.059 --> 19:46.686
Unless...

19:46.686 --> 19:48.605
you didn't sever it.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.315
I did.

19:50.315 --> 19:52.191
Now you speak truth.

19:53.985 --> 19:56.696
Your friends share your passion.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.824
Your temple shares your faith.

19:59.824 --> 20:01.618
Then...

20:01.618 --> 20:03.661
I have to choose?

20:03.661 --> 20:05.663
We do not choose.

20:05.663 --> 20:08.082
We walk down a path.

20:08.082 --> 20:11.294
Any path can be a holy one.

20:11.294 --> 20:13.671
So long as one walks it

20:13.671 --> 20:15.965
with truth.

20:15.965 --> 20:18.176
You can be
whomever you want to be

20:18.176 --> 20:20.470
in the Light, Pike Trickfoot.

20:20.470 --> 20:22.221
So I ask

20:22.221 --> 20:24.599
a final time...

20:24.599 --> 20:25.975
who...

20:25.975 --> 20:28.603
are... you?

20:28.603 --> 20:31.022
You, you, you...

21:01.552 --> 21:03.972

21:08.685 --> 21:11.646
Oi! You fellas got room

21:11.646 --> 21:13.982
I just got done
being a big bad hero,

21:13.982 --> 21:16.985
and I'm down
for a little ugly bumpin'.

21:19.737 --> 21:21.656
Aw, come on, I got enough magic

21:21.656 --> 21:23.324

There.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.375
Everywhere.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.210
Of course it's zombies.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.337
Yeah. Because fuck me,
that's why.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.426
The rebels should be gathering.

21:41.426 --> 21:44.345
If they saw the signal.

21:44.345 --> 21:46.514
Maybe we shouldn't have
announced ourselves

21:46.514 --> 21:48.349
with such... flair.

21:48.349 --> 21:49.934
Well, we wanted
the people to know

21:49.934 --> 21:51.894
the resistance is
still alive, right?

21:55.523 --> 21:56.733
Ay, oh!

21:56.733 --> 21:59.402
Scanlan, oh,
you fuckin' missed it!

21:59.402 --> 22:02.196
I got arrowed a bunch,
I had two voices

22:02.196 --> 22:04.907
in my throat, I stabbed
a stupid tongue in the face.

22:04.907 --> 22:06.451
Oh, shit.

22:06.451 --> 22:08.411
Hey, are you even
listening to me?

22:09.954 --> 22:11.372
There's a hor...

22:11.372 --> 22:12.957

22:12.957 --> 22:14.292
Yeah, not really the time

22:14.292 --> 22:15.918
for one
of your whorehouse stories.

22:15.918 --> 22:17.462
No... No.

22:17.462 --> 22:19.464
A horde of undead!

22:23.718 --> 22:26.220
Oh! Horde.
