WEBVTT

00:01.126 --> 00:02.668
It's Aurelia.
She was bearing a child.

00:02.836 --> 00:03.836
She tried to end it.

00:04.003 --> 00:05.462
We could repair
the perforation.

00:05.630 --> 00:06.797
Was it yours?

00:06.965 --> 00:08.382
You won't be able to bear
a child.

00:08.550 --> 00:09.842
I already got one.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.511
Where did all this come from?
I insist you answer!

00:12.679 --> 00:14.221
Take this fine lady

00:14.389 --> 00:16.097
back up to the wards
where she belongs.

00:16.265 --> 00:17.766
A ball?
In our home?

00:17.934 --> 00:19.476
Emmaand Alice
will be distracting

00:19.644 --> 00:22.229
those two blue bellies,
keeping them busy at the ball

00:22.397 --> 00:24.148
while I slip in
and make my way here.

00:24.315 --> 00:25.774
The oath is
a matter of allegiance.

00:25.942 --> 00:28.485
As the provost marshal,
you could grant me a reprieve.

00:28.653 --> 00:29.820
I can't go back.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.321
Tell Alice
that I love her.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.069 --> 01:13.697
In the lobby, please.
Gather in the lobby.

01:13.865 --> 01:18.160
A rebel patient absquatulated
from this hospital last night.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.871
Posthaste, we will be
bolstering security measures

01:21.039 --> 01:23.791
on any ward
housing confederate patients.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.793
The number of guards
shall be doubled.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.878
The method of changing shifts
is being reviewed.

01:28.046 --> 01:30.714
Major summers,
this escaped scoundrel...

01:30.882 --> 01:32.591
Did he act alone?

01:32.759 --> 01:35.511
We're still looking into whether
he was abetted in his flight

01:35.678 --> 01:37.387
or managed it himself.

01:37.555 --> 01:41.141
Regardless, with "vigilance" as
our watchword, I am confident --

01:41.309 --> 01:42.601
Doctor Summers!

01:42.769 --> 01:44.061
Uh, excuse me.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.480
There's a man out front --
rodent of a bloke --

01:46.648 --> 01:49.274
with a ghoulish lady
by his side.

01:49.442 --> 01:50.984
Says the inspector general
sent him.

01:51.152 --> 01:52.611
The medical inspector
today?

01:54.072 --> 01:55.906
Oh, he was supposed to come
next week.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.282
Shall I send him
away, sir?

01:57.450 --> 01:58.867
Uh...

01:59.035 --> 02:01.120
There's no need to discuss
the escaped patient

02:01.287 --> 02:02.412
outside these walls...

02:02.580 --> 02:04.039
Or even within.

02:04.207 --> 02:07.000
He's addressing you,
sister Isabella.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.669
Ah, we all know
how you girls gossip.

02:09.838 --> 02:13.757
The escaped patient is a minor
lapse we will promptly correct.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.717
Carry on!

02:15.885 --> 02:17.469
Uh, major summers,
a word, please.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.555
Have you given
any contemplation

02:19.722 --> 02:22.057
to the vacant
executive officer position?

02:22.225 --> 02:23.559
I feel the promotion
is due to me --

02:23.726 --> 02:25.519
not now, hale!

02:25.687 --> 02:27.813
Thursday last,
I performed 11 amputations

02:27.981 --> 02:28.730
in an 8-hour period.

02:28.898 --> 02:30.315
11? Really?

02:30.483 --> 02:31.567
With but
two mortalities.

02:31.734 --> 02:33.360
Oh, my, my,
that is impressive.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.154
I-I may not have
the most tender of touch,

02:35.321 --> 02:36.864
but I am efficient
and resourceful,

02:37.031 --> 02:39.116
with a-a strong military record
behind me.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.742
Hale?
Yes?

02:40.910 --> 02:43.620
Are you aware the medical
inspector is waiting to see me?

02:43.788 --> 02:45.706
Yes, I heard the matron.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.833
She --
she just said that.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.918
Fear not, hale.

02:50.086 --> 02:52.045
I will get to your promotion
soon enough.

02:52.213 --> 02:53.755
Dr. summers,
I wanted to discuss

02:53.923 --> 02:55.591
a new hygienic I-Initiative
with you.

02:55.758 --> 02:56.758
It's --
it's very important.

02:56.926 --> 02:58.468
Well, I'm sure it is,
Miss Phinney.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.929
Not as important
as the inspector!

03:02.807 --> 03:04.933
Guard shifts?
They'd better change the guards

03:05.101 --> 03:06.685
while they're at it,
or else these Rebs

03:06.853 --> 03:09.021
will keep running off
whenever they like.

03:12.233 --> 03:14.318
He wasn't right,
you know?

03:14.485 --> 03:16.695
He was on the mend,
but he wasn't nearly himself.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.740
He outwitted
the watchmen.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.825
Perhaps he was more mended
than we knew.

03:21.993 --> 03:23.785
Perhaps he was
put up to it.

03:23.953 --> 03:25.787
Perhaps he had help.

03:25.955 --> 03:27.873
I was at the ball,
chaplain.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.625
Yes, I know.

03:29.792 --> 03:30.918
I saw
what a fine job you did

03:31.085 --> 03:33.045
teaching those union men
how to dance.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.504
Nothing like
a rebel escape

04:15.672 --> 04:19.882
to mask other nefarious
nighttime doings.

04:20.051 --> 04:22.761
Aurelia is being
tended to by Sam.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.179
He's a good man.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.139
I don't know why he chooses
to be here.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.308
If it's merely
to learn medicine...

04:28.476 --> 04:30.102
It's not only that.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.687
It's to be a part of a cause
he believes in.

04:31.854 --> 04:33.647
Ah, yes,
the noble cause.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.567
Well, who am I to judge?
Some men believe in El Dorado.

04:40.780 --> 04:45.200
This malady of yours...
Is not simply cured.

04:45.368 --> 04:48.620
It is a battle
you must continue to fight.

04:48.788 --> 04:54.501
Should you need help...
I'm happy offer it.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.503
Indeed.

04:56.671 --> 04:59.631
You seemed to relish
locking me away in a room.

04:59.799 --> 05:03.051
As a child, I always wanted
a king Charles spaniel.

05:03.219 --> 05:05.137
Well, it's true
what they say --

05:05.305 --> 05:07.597
the bark is worse
than the bite.

05:07.765 --> 05:09.433
Is that what they say?

05:18.109 --> 05:19.443
Mary...

05:26.284 --> 05:28.618
...make sure
the laundress heals well.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.316
Oh, hold still now.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.901
It don't hurt.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.285
I found some eggs
in town.

06:10.453 --> 06:13.038
I...Could fry them up
if you're hungry.

06:15.416 --> 06:18.794
You understand,
don't you?

06:18.961 --> 06:20.587
Why I done it.

06:20.755 --> 06:24.716
I wasn't gonna bring a child
into this world like that.

06:24.884 --> 06:29.262
Someday, someone is gonna give
Bullen what's coming to him.

06:29.430 --> 06:30.972
Oh, leave it alone.

06:31.140 --> 06:33.183
He ain't worth it.

06:33.351 --> 06:36.186
What's he got
on you, huh?

06:36.354 --> 06:39.815
Does it have to do with
your people down South?

06:39.982 --> 06:42.692
Your little boy?

06:42.860 --> 06:45.529
Gabriel?

06:45.696 --> 06:49.741
You'll only make it worse
if you get mixed up in it.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.160
Oh...

07:04.882 --> 07:06.466
I'm tired of waiting!

07:06.634 --> 07:08.760
Please, sir, a doctor will
be with you as soon as he can.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.429
We're all the way down
from Norfolk,

07:10.596 --> 07:11.847
and we're
due back quick,

07:12.014 --> 07:13.640
or hadn't you heard
there's a war to be won?

07:13.808 --> 07:15.058
Water, we got here.
Preacher?

07:15.226 --> 07:17.811
In need of help,
are you, soldier?

07:17.979 --> 07:20.647
Ezekial Davis,
1 st Delaware infantry regiment.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.315
My brothers,
Hiram and Cyrus.

07:22.483 --> 07:23.859
We was granted leave
to come down and visit

07:24.026 --> 07:25.277
our brother, Jeremiah.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.946
Ah. Let's see
where he might be.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.739
He's with the 2nd
out of Baltimore.

07:29.907 --> 07:31.741
Davis, Davis...

07:31.909 --> 07:33.702
Let me check
the registry.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.253
Dr. Foster. I was so sorry
to hear of your illness

07:43.421 --> 07:46.089
and so relieved to get news
of your speedy recovery.

07:46.257 --> 07:49.009
Yes, I was well-tended.
Of course.

07:49.177 --> 07:50.552
Miss Phinney is
a wonderful nurse.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.346
A tad short of experience,
but just wonderful.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.599
I wonder --
has Dr. summers discussed

07:55.766 --> 07:58.018
the position
of executive officer?

07:58.186 --> 08:00.604
I know nothing of it.
Oh, no?

08:00.771 --> 08:02.772
It's a position
the surgeon general now requires

08:02.940 --> 08:04.441
at all of the larger
army hospitals --

08:04.609 --> 08:06.651
a sort of
second-in-command.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.653
Sounds utterly boring.

08:08.821 --> 08:10.655
Now that you're army,
I thought a man of your talent

08:10.823 --> 08:12.949
and ambition might crave
such a position.

08:13.117 --> 08:14.910
I do not crave it,
Miss Hastings.

08:15.077 --> 08:17.329
Oh, no?
Ah, well, very good.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.373
In any event, if there's
anything you need, doctor,

08:20.541 --> 08:23.919
anything at all,
I am always at your service.

08:24.086 --> 08:25.420
Uh, Dr. Foster?

08:25.588 --> 08:28.173
I'll be needing
your help down in the dead room.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.883
Pardon me.

08:33.638 --> 08:36.306
He fought valiantly
for weeks.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.517
We did all we could.

08:38.683 --> 08:41.019
You were his doctor?
Uh, not at the very end.

08:41.187 --> 08:44.188
I was...
Taken ill myself.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.900
Uh, the pastor was there
to fortify him

08:47.068 --> 08:49.194
on his final journey.
Really?

08:49.362 --> 08:51.238
Does he look
fortified to you?

08:53.950 --> 08:56.409
We'll need transport
for the body back to Delaware.

08:56.577 --> 08:57.827
Uh, it's not something

08:57.995 --> 08:59.371
we commonly take care of
here at the hospit--

08:59.539 --> 09:01.289
we can help you
arrange that.

09:01.457 --> 09:03.792
For his trappings,
as well.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.419
His rifle and uniform
are army issue.

09:06.587 --> 09:08.338
His personal traps,
I mean.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.382
Uh, he didn't have any,
I'm afraid.

09:12.718 --> 09:15.428
Mother sent several boxes
of provisions here --

09:15.596 --> 09:19.849
sweet cakes, uh, canned food,
some extra stockings.

09:20.017 --> 09:21.768
She said so in a letter.

09:21.936 --> 09:24.938
Yeah, well,
I'll make inquiries.

09:30.027 --> 09:31.820
What is it?

09:31.988 --> 09:33.405
What?!

09:33.573 --> 09:35.490
He doesn't want it.
The job is yours for the taking.

09:35.658 --> 09:36.825
It is?

09:36.993 --> 09:38.952
He seems entirely
without ambition.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.745
No wonder he has his sights set
on that harridan.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.122
Who, Miss Phinney?
Don't defend her.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.373
I wasn't.
I wouldn't --

09:43.541 --> 09:44.874
stop bloviating.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.294
Go get what's yours,
and by "yours" I mean ours.

09:47.461 --> 09:49.963
I can't right now.
Summers is with the inspector!

09:50.131 --> 09:51.715
What better opportunity
could you want?

09:51.882 --> 09:55.760
Go impress the inspector,
my dear docile dove.

09:57.471 --> 09:59.472
Oh! Yes.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.474
Yes! I see!

10:01.642 --> 10:03.560
Oh, by the way,
I, um, I need some help

10:03.728 --> 10:05.312
in the, uh,
the library.

10:05.479 --> 10:07.439
Several new patients
just in from Winchester.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.316
Those muddy
Massachusetts boys?

10:09.483 --> 10:10.942
Get your friend
Miss Phinney.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.485
She's cut from
the same unseemly cloth.

10:12.653 --> 10:14.029
I am far too busy.

10:14.196 --> 10:15.363
Come.

10:18.117 --> 10:19.492
Hmm.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.879
As you'll see, inspector,

10:31.047 --> 10:34.049
our staff provides
scientific care

10:34.216 --> 10:36.384
while striving to create
a placid atmosphere,

10:36.552 --> 10:39.054
promoting recovery
of mind and body.

10:39.221 --> 10:40.430
Not entirely placid.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.390
There appears to be
some hubbub about.

10:42.558 --> 10:44.142
Hubbub? I-I'm not --

10:44.310 --> 10:46.311
I'm not sure what you mean,
sir -- "hubbub."

10:46.479 --> 10:49.314
I've heard some whispers.
Is there a patient missing?

10:49.482 --> 10:51.399
A patient what?

10:51.567 --> 10:53.610
There are women here.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.071
Are these sores quite painful,
would you say?

10:56.238 --> 10:58.865
Pardon me for a moment,
would you?

11:01.786 --> 11:03.662
Uh
Miss Phinney?

11:05.873 --> 11:08.166
These, um...
These people -- what are they?

11:08.334 --> 11:09.459
They are patients, sir.

11:09.627 --> 11:10.960
Are they fancy girls,
Miss Phinney --

11:11.128 --> 11:12.545
fast tricks,
Dutch gals?

11:12.713 --> 11:14.255
I don't know
what those things are, sir.

11:14.423 --> 11:15.799
These women
are prostitutes.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.092
What the bloody hell --

11:19.261 --> 11:20.845
what are they doing
in my hospital?

11:21.013 --> 11:23.390
It's an assistance program
I've started for public women.

11:23.557 --> 11:25.141
On your own say so
with nary a word to me?

11:25.309 --> 11:26.559
I tried to tell you
this morning.

11:26.727 --> 11:27.894
Oh, no, you did not.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.270
It benefits
the soldiers, truly.
Mm.

11:29.438 --> 11:30.605
There's a been
a significant increase

11:30.773 --> 11:32.148
in cases of syphilis
among the boys.

11:32.316 --> 11:33.733
If the girls are clean,
it only --

11:33.901 --> 11:36.695
y-your logic is impeccable,
Miss Phinney.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.238
Your timing is not.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.699
If this inspector
approves

11:40.866 --> 11:42.784
of the way I'm handling
the job here,

11:42.952 --> 11:45.203
I'll be put on a desk
in Washington city.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.414
Do you know how much I would
like that, Miss Phinney --

11:47.581 --> 11:49.874
a desk
in Washington city?

11:50.042 --> 11:52.877
Very, very much!

11:53.045 --> 11:56.339
Now, please,
get these women out of here

11:56.507 --> 11:57.757
as quickly as possible.

11:57.925 --> 12:01.219
My, my.
What a lot of ladies.

12:01.387 --> 12:02.679
What is it, hale?

12:02.847 --> 12:05.098
Um, I was thinking,
if you need some relief,

12:05.266 --> 12:06.933
I'd be happy
to escort the inspector.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.143
Is that so?

12:08.310 --> 12:09.352
Perhaps if
it smoothed the way

12:09.520 --> 12:12.105
for, um, what
we discussed earlier.

12:12.273 --> 12:13.606
I have to go now.

12:13.774 --> 12:16.109
Quite a day
it's shaping up to be.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.527
Indeed.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.154
Oh, Miss Phinney,
I could use a spot of help

12:19.321 --> 12:21.406
with some of your kinsmen over
here. Do you mind?

12:21.574 --> 12:24.242
I'm rather occupied.
Could you ask, Miss Hastings?

12:24.410 --> 12:26.327
Asked and answered.
Miss Hastings is far too busy.

12:26.495 --> 12:28.621
Come, come.

12:28.789 --> 12:31.458
The nurses can recall
no care package

12:31.625 --> 12:32.959
ever arriving
for your brother.

12:35.463 --> 12:38.757
Tell me, matron,
did these nurses look well-fed,

12:38.924 --> 12:40.967
have sweet-cake crumbs
about their mouth,

12:41.135 --> 12:42.510
or happen to be wearing
extra socks?

12:42.678 --> 12:43.845
Ah, there's no need

12:44.013 --> 12:45.597
to cast aspersions,
corporal Davis.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.099
I'm sure this is all
a misunderstanding.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.518
A misunderstanding?
Those provisions could've

12:50.686 --> 12:52.312
given Jeremiah the strength
he needed to get better.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.772
With all due respect,

12:53.939 --> 12:56.065
your brother died
of a musket ball to the gut,

12:56.233 --> 12:57.901
not a lack of sweet cakes.

12:58.068 --> 12:59.736
Well, at least they would have
brought him comfort

12:59.904 --> 13:01.362
as he faced his maker.

13:01.530 --> 13:03.364
One thing's
for certain, doctor.

13:03.532 --> 13:05.074
We only die but once.

13:07.995 --> 13:10.580
Gentlemen,
my condolences, truly.

13:10.748 --> 13:14.000
But I must resume
my rounds.

13:14.168 --> 13:17.545
I'll see about
helping you arrange transport

13:17.713 --> 13:19.172
for your brother.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.381
Our brother's
not going nowhere.

13:20.549 --> 13:21.800
And neither are we,

13:21.967 --> 13:23.843
not without the things
our mother sent him.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.245
Those from
your secret kitchen, boy?

13:50.412 --> 13:52.580
They're from the ward,
Mr. Bullen.

13:52.748 --> 13:55.708
If you and that Boston blue nose
want to waste your time

13:55.876 --> 13:57.877
doing my job for me,
well, go ahead.

13:58.045 --> 14:01.548
We appreciate that.
So do all the hungry soldiers.

14:13.394 --> 14:16.229
We got a problem between us,
don't we?

14:16.397 --> 14:19.357
A failure to...
Collaborate?

14:23.404 --> 14:27.323
I see how your jaw tightens
every time you come near me.

14:27.491 --> 14:30.618
What we have, sir...

14:30.786 --> 14:33.621
Is...

14:33.789 --> 14:35.206
You on one hand.

14:35.374 --> 14:39.085
A man who thinks
what he does is invisible.

14:39.253 --> 14:44.549
And on the other hand, me,
a man who sees clearly.

14:44.717 --> 14:49.387
I see what you do, Mr. Bullen,
and I see what you are.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.015
Leave her alone now.
Hear me?

14:52.182 --> 14:54.726
Huh. Ain't for me
to do the leaving.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.227
She's the one
that keeps coming around.

14:56.395 --> 14:59.105
Stealing food off wounded men
is low enough,

14:59.273 --> 15:01.649
but some things you take
from a person can kill 'em.

15:01.817 --> 15:03.401
She say I took it?

15:03.569 --> 15:05.403
Only she gave it, boy --
gave it willing.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.447
Why would she do that?!
Huh?!

15:07.615 --> 15:08.990
Now, you tell me!

15:09.158 --> 15:11.075
Tell me!

15:11.243 --> 15:12.577
We had a deal!

15:12.745 --> 15:13.870
What sort of deal?!

15:14.038 --> 15:15.371
Safe passage here
for her family.

15:15.539 --> 15:17.332
S-safe passage from where?

15:17.499 --> 15:19.292
North Carolina, I think.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.377
You think?
You don't know?

15:21.545 --> 15:23.588
It was Roanoke Island.
I said I knew a man down there.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.214
You said?

15:25.382 --> 15:27.675
And you had no intention
of keeping your word, did you?

15:27.843 --> 15:29.218
I'm a hospital steward,

15:29.386 --> 15:30.970
not a goddamn conductor
for the underground railroad!

15:34.600 --> 15:36.267
Now you leave her be,

15:36.435 --> 15:38.728
or I swear by God,
I'll kill you myself.

15:46.987 --> 15:49.489
Bayoneted in the arm
during a camp fight.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.617
He'll be fine to return
to his regiment in a week or so.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.161
Uh, trampled by a horse,
crushed his leg.

15:55.329 --> 15:58.081
It'll have to come off,
of course.

15:58.248 --> 16:00.583
Oh, musket ball
to the buttocks.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.877
Evidently,
by one of his own.

16:03.045 --> 16:06.047
Good lesson on the importance
of rank and file. Um...

16:06.215 --> 16:07.882
What about that man?

16:08.050 --> 16:11.970
Uh, yes, uh...
Alas, there's no hope for him.

16:12.137 --> 16:14.389
Best focus
your ministrations elsewhere.

16:14.556 --> 16:16.432
What precisely
does he suffer from?

16:16.600 --> 16:18.559
Dr. hale,
may I discuss a matter with you?

16:18.727 --> 16:20.770
It's of some urgency --
so sorry.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.148
Why are you here
with her?

16:24.316 --> 16:25.650
Because
you refused to come.

16:25.818 --> 16:26.943
I don't mean that.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.909
I-I tried. I tried to get
a meeting with the inspector,

16:35.077 --> 16:36.536
but, uh,
summers rebuffed it.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.621
Try harder, Byron.

16:38.789 --> 16:40.707
Dear God, must I do
all the thinking for us?

16:40.874 --> 16:43.584
They got him!
Traitor!
Put that dog back!

16:43.752 --> 16:46.796
First front royal,
now Winchester?

16:46.964 --> 16:48.589
Your father's right --

16:48.757 --> 16:50.591
we won't have to live
like this much longer.

16:50.759 --> 16:52.176
Mm.

16:54.930 --> 16:56.514
Some ruckus at the hotel.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.975
Oh, nothing to be
concerned over, dear.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.769
Just rowdy soldiers
making trouble.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.776
This is what happens to
traitors!

17:08.944 --> 17:10.528
This will learn
the rest of them!

17:10.695 --> 17:12.946
Bring 'em all out to see
what happens when you run.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.199
He was hiding in the woods,
but my aim was true!

17:15.367 --> 17:17.952
Took him down
at 50 paces.

17:18.119 --> 17:20.121
You didn't get him,
I did.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.414
Shot him
right off his horse

17:21.582 --> 17:23.082
as he galloped
along the riverbed,

17:23.250 --> 17:25.042
dropped like
a sack of potatoes.

17:25.210 --> 17:28.046
Soldier, enemy or no,
this boy was a child of God,

17:28.213 --> 17:29.922
and this
young lady's friend.

17:30.090 --> 17:32.759
Choose your friends
better, Miss.

17:32.926 --> 17:34.552
Animals!

17:34.720 --> 17:36.679
You cold-blooded savages!

17:36.847 --> 17:38.848
Quiet now.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.350
If you're going to
tell tales,

17:41.518 --> 17:42.935
you might at least
get your stories straight.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.104
Was it the woods or the
riverbank, on foot or horseback?

17:45.272 --> 17:47.732
What does it matter?
The reb got what he deserved.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.943
Better off dead
than out here shooting at us.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.074
How about
one of you marksmen

17:56.241 --> 17:57.700
give me a hand
with his legs?

17:57.868 --> 18:01.662
Let him rot. A warning to any
who'd try the same!

18:38.534 --> 18:40.576
Sam?

18:40.744 --> 18:42.578
That boy
got himself killed?

18:42.746 --> 18:44.664
He'd have been better off
in prison.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.333
Too late now.
What happened there?

18:47.501 --> 18:50.086
Banged it in a door.

18:50.254 --> 18:53.047
Mm, better let me
take a look.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.966
Knuckles are scraped.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.343
Seems like
you hit something.

18:57.511 --> 19:02.014
Dr. Foster, I appreciate
your concern, I do, but...

19:04.893 --> 19:07.728
...i punched a pot.

19:07.896 --> 19:11.399
I'm sure
the pot had it coming.

19:11.567 --> 19:14.944
The steward and I
had a run-in.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.530
Well, it's none
of my business, really.

19:17.698 --> 19:21.284
He's the reason...
For what happened.

19:21.451 --> 19:23.536
He's the cause.

19:26.331 --> 19:27.915
Mr. Bullen is not someone

19:28.083 --> 19:29.709
you can afford
to make an enemy of.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.878
So, what then?

19:32.045 --> 19:33.462
He gets away with it?
Sam --

19:33.630 --> 19:35.214
lying? Stealing?

19:35.382 --> 19:39.677
Do whatever he pleases...
To a vulnerable girl?

19:39.845 --> 19:43.973
Some battles
are not worth fighting.

19:44.141 --> 19:47.935
If that's so...
Then what are we all doing here?

20:00.282 --> 20:04.076
I found some honey in
Doctor Summers' private stash.

20:04.244 --> 20:05.661
He won't miss it.

20:09.499 --> 20:11.834
That dead boy...

20:12.002 --> 20:13.920
He was my sister's beau.

20:16.798 --> 20:21.052
We all grew up
together.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.055
I'm sorry.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.475
I should have...

20:27.643 --> 20:29.602
Done more for him.

20:29.770 --> 20:32.396
He chose to run.
That's not your fault.

20:34.691 --> 20:36.525
The road they used
to bring the wounded men up

20:36.693 --> 20:38.986
from the barges --

20:39.154 --> 20:42.949
I've heard them call it
"mercy street."

20:43.116 --> 20:45.243
Because
it leads them here,

20:45.410 --> 20:47.161
where they might
be saved.

20:50.582 --> 20:53.501
It's a lie.

20:53.669 --> 20:59.173
There's no mercy,
not here.

20:59.341 --> 21:00.967
Not anywhere.

21:04.805 --> 21:07.974
Isn't there?

21:08.141 --> 21:10.893
Isn't it what we offer
every day?

21:18.944 --> 21:21.279
I must go tell my sister.

21:26.243 --> 21:30.329
Thank you, nurse Mary.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.721
You seem to be short
on some wards.

21:46.888 --> 21:48.514
Winchester has
set us back a bit.

21:48.682 --> 21:50.474
It will turn around soon,
doctor.

21:50.642 --> 21:51.726
I hear
they're moving troops

21:51.893 --> 21:53.436
out of the peninsula
and into the valley.

21:53.603 --> 21:54.812
A temporary setback.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.606
We will have our way
before long.

21:57.774 --> 21:59.191
In the meantime,
you must keep up.

21:59.359 --> 22:00.609
You must be Inspector Mussey.

22:00.777 --> 22:03.154
I'm Miss Hastings,
and this is Doctor Hale,

22:03.322 --> 22:06.282
our most experienced
military surgeon --

22:06.450 --> 22:08.200
after Dr. summers,
of course.

22:08.368 --> 22:09.785
Are you the
executive officer then?

22:09.953 --> 22:11.245
Well, no, sir.

22:11.413 --> 22:12.830
That post has not yet
been filled.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.582
It will be soon.
Not to worry.

22:14.750 --> 22:15.916
Though Doctor Hale is
most certainly

22:16.084 --> 22:17.501
the most qualified
candidate.

22:17.669 --> 22:19.920
Shall we continue with the tour?

22:20.088 --> 22:21.714
Pleased to meet you both.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.716
You two have something
in common, I believe.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.051
Isn't that so, Dr. hale?

22:25.218 --> 22:26.344
Yes --
yes, we do.

22:26.511 --> 22:27.928
Um, if I'm not mistaken,

22:28.096 --> 22:30.973
our fathers served together
in the war of 1812.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.934
Is that right? Under
General Stricker's 5th Regiment?

22:34.102 --> 22:36.854
Y-yes.
That sounds correct.

22:37.022 --> 22:39.982
Dr. summers, a word?
Yes, yes, Dr. Foster.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.443
Uh, Inspector Mussey, I'd like
to introduce Dr. Foster.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.070
Mm. A moment?

22:44.237 --> 22:45.571
Quickly, please.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.490
I have concerns
about the steward.

22:47.657 --> 22:49.033
Oh, not now, Dr. Foster.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.202
About how he abuses
his authority.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.330
Steward Bullen has
a challenging job.

22:54.498 --> 22:56.707
The allocation of resources
is a thankless task.

22:56.875 --> 22:58.167
This is not
an allocation issue.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.127
That'll be all,
Dr. Foster.

23:02.589 --> 23:04.006
I'd like
to address this later.

23:04.174 --> 23:06.258
Hmm.

23:06.426 --> 23:08.719
Shall we continue?

23:12.015 --> 23:13.974
Well...

23:14.142 --> 23:16.352
That's a good start

23:16.520 --> 23:17.978
well done, Hastings.

23:30.283 --> 23:31.659
Alice?

23:48.427 --> 23:50.928
They grew up with Tom,

23:51.096 --> 23:52.805
went to school with him.

23:52.973 --> 23:55.724
Played with him, went to church
with him.

23:55.892 --> 23:57.351
It's a terrible thing.

23:57.519 --> 23:58.894
And now poor Olivia.

23:59.062 --> 24:01.856
Widowed at such a young age,
now childless.

24:02.023 --> 24:04.066
She can't even
bury her boy properly.

24:04.234 --> 24:06.861
And if it's money
that she needs...

24:07.028 --> 24:09.864
Not only that --
union rules.

24:10.031 --> 24:12.283
They won't let Tom
be buried here.

24:16.329 --> 24:19.748
Not everyone manages
as we do, James.

24:24.629 --> 24:28.257
Then I will manage this
for Mrs. Fairfax.

24:28.425 --> 24:30.843
I'll see to it
that Tom has a proper burial.

24:36.641 --> 24:38.726
You seem surprised.

24:38.894 --> 24:42.146
I made it myself.

24:42.314 --> 24:45.983
Well, kindness is more
than I've come to expect.

24:46.151 --> 24:48.527
Everyone's got
a right to kindness.

24:50.780 --> 24:53.032
Burn on your side --
is that your only injury?

24:53.200 --> 24:54.325
Led to an abscess.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.452
Peroneal
something or other.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.412
Can't hardly walk now.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.345
It was an accident.

25:14.513 --> 25:17.473
It looks like someone
took an iron to you.

25:17.641 --> 25:20.142
Tell her, you yellow dog.
Tell her how you run away!

25:20.310 --> 25:21.393
I never did.

25:21.561 --> 25:22.937
Dig your furrow straight,
Starks.

25:23.104 --> 25:24.980
We was led right into
stonewall's gunsights.

25:25.148 --> 25:26.857
Don't believe a word
this shirker says, Miss!

25:27.025 --> 25:28.651
Damn you,
you son of a bitch!

25:29.861 --> 25:30.903
Stop it!

25:33.323 --> 25:34.949
To your bed!

25:35.116 --> 25:38.118
Quiet on this ward, or it'll be
the brig for both of you!

25:40.372 --> 25:42.081
I told you
not to mind him.

25:48.838 --> 25:50.923
Ah!

25:54.386 --> 25:57.555
Linear wound
in the soft palate.

25:57.722 --> 26:00.641
Consistent
with a pistol ball.

26:00.809 --> 26:04.019
And this injury
in the back of his head

26:04.187 --> 26:06.564
is where it came out.

26:06.731 --> 26:09.024
So it's improbable
that anyone made this shot

26:09.192 --> 26:10.776
from across a field?

26:10.944 --> 26:12.278
Impossible, actually.

26:12.445 --> 26:14.572
There's soot surrounding
his mouth.

26:14.739 --> 26:17.825
The pistol was discharged
from point-blank range.

26:17.993 --> 26:21.328
Tearing of the tongue and lips
support that, as well.

26:21.496 --> 26:23.289
Point-blank?
Mm.

26:23.456 --> 26:26.375
The barrel was inside
of his mouth, which...

26:26.543 --> 26:27.459
Suggests...

26:27.627 --> 26:29.962
Self-murder. Yes.

26:32.507 --> 26:34.383
It could be worse,

26:34.551 --> 26:37.428
considering the alternative is
a full amputation.

26:37.596 --> 26:40.306
Have you had success
with this technique?

26:40.473 --> 26:43.392
Excision?
Well, as a matter of fact,

26:43.560 --> 26:45.978
let's have Dr. Foster
answer that.

26:46.146 --> 26:48.439
Foster, I am demonstrating
an excision

26:48.607 --> 26:49.607
for Inspector Mussey.

26:49.774 --> 26:50.983
Would you care to relate

26:51.151 --> 26:52.651
your own experiences
with the procedure?

26:52.819 --> 26:54.361
Certainly.
Uh, perhaps later.

26:54.529 --> 26:58.407
I was only trying to fetch
my kit, and here it is.

26:58.575 --> 27:01.243
Now that you're here,
do take a moment.

27:03.496 --> 27:05.706
As I'm sure
Dr. summers explained,

27:05.874 --> 27:08.167
removing the bone fragments,
but leaving the limb

27:08.335 --> 27:09.877
allows new bone to grow,

27:10.045 --> 27:14.465
often enough to restore adequate
function to the appendage.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.134
And in your experience,
this is an effective method?

27:17.302 --> 27:19.511
Well, it's not
always successful,

27:19.679 --> 27:22.139
but on the whole,
it's...

27:22.307 --> 27:24.099
Everything all right,
doctor?

27:24.267 --> 27:25.976
Yes.

27:26.144 --> 27:29.188
Um, I was -- I'm just
remembering something I'm --

27:29.356 --> 27:30.606
I need to attend to.

27:30.774 --> 27:33.400
Uh, finish up for me here,
Foster, would you?

27:43.578 --> 27:45.621
Miss?
Could I have some water?

27:45.789 --> 27:47.039
Of course.

27:48.583 --> 27:49.333
Frank, you're --

27:49.501 --> 27:52.169
yes, my beloved, I am.

27:58.802 --> 28:02.054
I thought when they brought Tom
back, I-I was afraid...

28:02.222 --> 28:04.181
I was dead?

28:04.349 --> 28:06.058
I would be...

28:06.226 --> 28:08.435
If it wasn't for Tom.

28:11.856 --> 28:15.359
We were headed
for the woods.

28:15.527 --> 28:19.113
We'd almost made it --
just one last clearing to cross.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.281
We took fire.

28:21.449 --> 28:25.661
Some bluejackets hiding
like cowards in the bushes.

28:25.829 --> 28:28.455
Is that when Tom --
no.

28:28.623 --> 28:30.791
Tom made it
to the tree line.

28:30.959 --> 28:34.336
Halfway across, my --
my horse threw me.

28:34.504 --> 28:36.964
Oh, Frank!
And I'm lying there...

28:37.132 --> 28:40.134
Rifle gone,
good as dead, and --

28:40.301 --> 28:44.638
And then
out of nowhere, Tom comes back.

28:44.806 --> 28:48.851
He's yelling and waving
his arms, drawing their fire.

28:49.018 --> 28:51.854
I race into the woods,
sure that he is right behind me,

28:52.021 --> 28:54.982
but I turned and saw
that he had fallen.

28:55.150 --> 28:56.817
And you went back
for him?

28:56.985 --> 28:59.695
I started to.

28:59.863 --> 29:02.197
But they were upon him.

29:02.365 --> 29:08.412
I saw him raise his hands
high into the air to surrender.

29:08.580 --> 29:11.373
But they shot him anyway.

29:11.541 --> 29:14.126
Murdered him
in cold blood.

29:14.294 --> 29:18.839
Those are the type of men...
That we are fighting, Emma.

29:19.007 --> 29:21.800
It's important
that everyone knows it.

29:21.968 --> 29:25.429
It's why we must win this war
at any cost.

29:36.691 --> 29:37.983
Have you seen
Miss Hastings?

29:38.151 --> 29:39.359
No, sir.

29:39.527 --> 29:42.571
Well, you'll have to do.
Come with me.

29:42.739 --> 29:45.574
Please come with me.

29:45.742 --> 29:49.286
If this is about
the ladies, sir I --

29:50.705 --> 29:52.748
I need you
to cut off my finger.

29:52.916 --> 29:55.083
What?

29:55.251 --> 29:57.461
Just the tip.

29:57.629 --> 29:58.921
I don't understand.

29:59.088 --> 30:02.382
I was performing an excision
on a gangrenous arm.

30:02.550 --> 30:07.262
While so doing,
I nicked my fingertip.

30:07.430 --> 30:11.934
And now in order to prevent
the spread of the gangrene

30:12.101 --> 30:14.269
through the rest of the hand
and beyond,

30:14.437 --> 30:15.562
the digit must go.

30:15.730 --> 30:17.648
That seems
an extreme course of action.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.233
It is.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.903
But, um, I have seen enough
to take no chances.

30:23.071 --> 30:25.197
An hour from now,
it might be the entire finger.

30:25.365 --> 30:26.740
Two hours,
the whole hand.

30:26.908 --> 30:28.909
Surely, there are others
more qualified than I --

30:29.077 --> 30:30.744
Doctor Foster or --

30:30.912 --> 30:34.331
I am hoping to spare not only
my hand but my pride, as well.

30:36.709 --> 30:38.919
Oh, my. I d--

30:39.087 --> 30:40.128
I don't think I can.

30:40.296 --> 30:41.797
It is not complicated.

30:41.965 --> 30:43.549
I'll talk you
through it.

30:43.716 --> 30:47.177
Can I count on your help --
and your confidence?

30:52.433 --> 30:54.393
You're gonna need this.

30:54.561 --> 30:56.311
And I...

30:56.479 --> 31:00.023
I'm going to
need this.

31:10.660 --> 31:14.872
He'll be buried today
in the Fairfax family plot.

31:17.083 --> 31:18.750
My father's seen to it.

31:18.918 --> 31:22.337
It may seem like small comfort,
but the solace of prayer --

31:22.505 --> 31:24.339
I'm not here to pray.

31:29.846 --> 31:35.017
Help me understand
how men can be so cruel.

31:37.604 --> 31:42.566
There's no good explanation
for the cruelty of war.

31:42.734 --> 31:43.859
When otherwise decent men

31:44.027 --> 31:45.777
believe strongly enough
in a cause --

31:45.945 --> 31:47.863
this is not
about decent men.

31:48.031 --> 31:50.324
This is about union men.

31:50.491 --> 31:52.743
Decent men wouldn't take
all that my family has

31:52.911 --> 31:55.078
with nary
a second thought.

31:55.246 --> 31:57.915
Decent men would not parade
Tom's remains like a trophy.

31:58.082 --> 32:00.959
It was wrong,
undeniably, and yet we have --

32:01.127 --> 32:02.461
decent men would not
cast their lot

32:02.629 --> 32:05.339
with those who are so clearly
not decent men.

32:08.927 --> 32:13.263
You want to know who's
responsible for Tom's death?

32:13.431 --> 32:14.431
You are.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.310
You and everyone
who aided his escape.

32:18.478 --> 32:20.354
Aided him?
I never --

32:20.521 --> 32:23.023
don't lie to me.

32:23.191 --> 32:25.233
He wasn't well.
You knew that as much as I.

32:25.401 --> 32:27.069
I knew no such thing!
He wasn't ready
to go back...

32:27.236 --> 32:28.820
How dare you say
I killed him!

32:28.988 --> 32:30.530
...to hold a musket in his hand
and face the horrors of war.

32:30.698 --> 32:32.616
If his friends hadn't broken him
out, he'd still be alive.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.035
His friends were not the ones
who shot him in cold blood.

32:35.203 --> 32:37.537
His friends didn't pull the
trigger that ended Tom's life!

32:37.705 --> 32:39.581
That's right!
Tom did!

32:41.334 --> 32:43.168
Tom did.

32:51.427 --> 32:53.387
I know it to be true.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.276
You the brothers
of Jeremiah Davis?

33:08.444 --> 33:11.154
We are. This coffin's heavy,
so stand clear.

33:11.322 --> 33:13.031
I heard from the matron
that your brother's belongings

33:13.199 --> 33:16.243
went missing --
some provisions he was sent.

33:16.411 --> 33:17.786
You know
what happened to them?

33:17.954 --> 33:19.079
I'm afraid I do, sir,

33:19.247 --> 33:21.123
and I'm here to apologize
for my misdeeds.

33:21.290 --> 33:24.042
Silas Bullen at your service --
the steward of mansion house.

33:24.210 --> 33:26.294
Are you responsible for the
disappearance of those packages?

33:26.462 --> 33:28.463
Not directly, sir,
but a man in my employ

33:28.631 --> 33:31.133
has proved to be a craven thief,
and he's the culprit.

33:33.136 --> 33:34.636
This man
still work here?

33:34.804 --> 33:37.222
I ran him off as soon as
I discovered his thieving ways.

33:37.390 --> 33:38.890
He's one of them
free niggers.

33:39.058 --> 33:40.350
Seemed to think
freedom meant

33:40.518 --> 33:41.643
freedom to take
what don't belong to him.

33:41.811 --> 33:43.603
Does this thief
have a name?

33:45.523 --> 33:47.607
I know Dr. summers
regarded your visit

33:47.775 --> 33:49.109
with the highest
priority.

33:49.277 --> 33:50.861
No matter.
You seem more than capable

33:51.029 --> 33:53.405
of answering our questions
and a good deal less concerned

33:53.573 --> 33:54.990
with giving us
the whitewash.

33:55.158 --> 33:57.117
Tell me your concerns
about the steward.

33:57.285 --> 33:59.536
That's her!
That's the whore!

33:59.704 --> 34:00.996
You'd better bump her
to the front of the line!

34:01.164 --> 34:02.956
She's the reason
I've been burning for a month!

34:03.124 --> 34:04.207
That right?
Yeah, next, you're gonna blame

34:04.375 --> 34:05.500
that bum foot
on me, too?!

34:05.668 --> 34:07.252
You tramp!
You gimp!

34:07.420 --> 34:09.295
Just how long have you
been treating ladies

34:09.464 --> 34:10.630
at this hospital?

34:10.797 --> 34:13.382
I believe
it's a new program, inspector.

34:13.551 --> 34:16.762
As you can see, it is not
irrelevant to our men's health.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.018
Where can I find Sam Diggs?

34:24.187 --> 34:25.645
Tell me
where he resides, boy.

34:25.813 --> 34:28.732
You better not lie,
or we'll be back for you next.

34:33.654 --> 34:35.614
Uh, inspector,
excuse me for a moment?

34:35.782 --> 34:37.574
Don't you disappear
on me, too!

34:37.742 --> 34:39.659
What's this stir all about,
soldier?

34:39.827 --> 34:41.870
We found out who it was stole
from our dying brother.

34:42.038 --> 34:44.246
Your steward come clean
about the whole affair.

34:58.429 --> 35:01.723
Miss? Miss,
come join us, please.

35:01.891 --> 35:04.184
I feel your report
might benefit

35:04.352 --> 35:06.895
from the perspective
of an actual patient here.

35:07.063 --> 35:10.315
I'll leave you be then
so as not to color her answers.

35:10.483 --> 35:11.942
Be forthright
and thorough

35:12.110 --> 35:13.902
in your conversation,
young lady.

35:14.070 --> 35:16.696
Forthright and thorough are
my specialties, sir.

35:19.951 --> 35:20.992
Uh.

35:25.331 --> 35:27.165
No one must know
about Tom.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.417
It's bad enough
he's here.

35:29.585 --> 35:31.002
Must you disgrace
our whole family

35:31.170 --> 35:33.672
by walking with him
after what they did to Tom?

35:33.840 --> 35:35.507
The chaplain was
Tom's friend.

35:35.675 --> 35:37.884
He has a right
to pay his respects.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.099
Thank you.

35:44.267 --> 35:47.644
I spoke the truth.
Nothing more.

35:55.278 --> 35:57.988
Let's dig a good grave
for Tom.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.921
Is this a rebel party?

36:15.089 --> 36:17.090
It is.
This family's plot's here.

36:17.258 --> 36:20.385
Not anymore. This cemetery is
under union control now.

36:20.553 --> 36:21.845
Go on home.

36:22.013 --> 36:22.929
Listen here,
young man.

36:23.097 --> 36:24.764
For generations,
these people

36:24.932 --> 36:27.267
have buried their dead
in this spot.

36:27.435 --> 36:30.103
Go...On...Home.

36:32.273 --> 36:34.274
You may speak to the provost.
He knows me.

36:34.442 --> 36:35.942
We have an agreement.

36:36.110 --> 36:37.944
And I have orders.

36:40.907 --> 36:41.865
Stop!

36:44.493 --> 36:47.495
I have signed the loyalty oath
just yesterday.

36:50.291 --> 36:55.128
Now...Let us bury this boy
with his ancestors.

36:55.296 --> 36:56.379
Show me the document.

36:56.547 --> 36:58.340
The papers are
at my residence.

36:58.507 --> 37:00.050
Go get them.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.761
Do you really want
to make this mourning party

37:02.929 --> 37:05.138
stand here
while I do that?

37:05.306 --> 37:07.974
Hasn't this boy's poor mother
suffered enough?!

37:08.142 --> 37:09.476
Please.

37:09.644 --> 37:11.686
That's my son.

37:11.854 --> 37:13.438
I beg you!

37:18.986 --> 37:20.278
No, James.

37:23.866 --> 37:25.742
I'm going to dig
this grave now.

37:25.910 --> 37:27.327
If you want to shoot me,
so be it.

37:27.495 --> 37:29.537
I'll dig it big enough
for two.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.569
You quite possibly
saved my life.

38:01.737 --> 38:03.738
I'm relieved
I got through it.

38:03.906 --> 38:07.284
Well...I suppose
even Miss Dix

38:07.451 --> 38:09.035
occasionally
gets something right.

38:11.163 --> 38:13.623
There you are, major.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.458
I was wondering
if you'd ever turn up again.

38:15.626 --> 38:18.128
Oh, m-my sincere apologies,
inspector.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.463
I, um,
I trust Dr. Foster --

38:20.631 --> 38:22.507
disappeared, as well.

38:22.675 --> 38:24.050
It's as if you all have
something better to do

38:24.218 --> 38:26.011
than show me around.

38:26.178 --> 38:29.097
Perhaps Miss Phinney and I
can continue your tour.

38:29.265 --> 38:30.682
Not necessary.

38:30.850 --> 38:32.600
I've seen more than enough
to make my evaluation.

38:32.768 --> 38:34.936
I'll find Miss Evans,
and we'll be on our way.

38:35.104 --> 38:37.897
Thank you for
the hospitality, summers.

38:40.568 --> 38:42.027
And you, too,
Miss Phinney.

38:42.194 --> 38:44.237
Are you leaving already,
inspector?
I am.

38:44.405 --> 38:47.240
Well, I certainly hope you had
an informative visit.

38:47.408 --> 38:49.242
Indeed. Perhaps
a recommendation from you

38:49.410 --> 38:52.329
will spur Dr. summers to fill
that vacant position.

38:52.496 --> 38:55.040
Perhaps, but in all candor,
Miss Hastings,

38:55.207 --> 38:58.543
my recommendation will be
to appoint Dr. Foster.

38:58.711 --> 39:00.795
What?!
Why him?!

39:00.963 --> 39:05.008
He seems to be the man
for the job.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.968
Thanks, honey.

39:11.015 --> 39:12.766
Miss, one more thing...

39:23.361 --> 39:25.278
Oh, Dr. Foster!

39:25.446 --> 39:27.072
They took him!
They're gonna hurt him!

39:27.239 --> 39:28.782
Please don't let them
hurt him!

39:28.949 --> 39:30.700
Mr. Bullen was lying to you!

39:33.245 --> 39:34.954
If I had
your brother's things,

39:35.122 --> 39:36.790
you think I'd be willing
to die for 'em?

39:42.254 --> 39:44.172
With freedom
comes responsibility, boy.

39:44.340 --> 39:46.424
That's something all you people
are gonna have to learn.

39:46.592 --> 39:48.718
You about to learn
the hard way.

39:59.772 --> 40:01.439
Go to hell,
both of you.

40:01.607 --> 40:03.149
Looks like you gonna
go there first.

40:03.317 --> 40:05.276
Let go of the rope!

40:05.444 --> 40:06.736
This ain't none
of your business, doc!

40:06.904 --> 40:09.155
Well, this gun's
about to be your business

40:09.323 --> 40:10.490
if you don't let it go.

40:10.658 --> 40:12.033
I'm a member
of the union army.

40:12.201 --> 40:13.451
So am I.

40:13.619 --> 40:15.537
You gonna shoot me
over a nigger?

40:15.704 --> 40:17.539
I don't think so.

40:18.833 --> 40:20.333
You're already sending
one brother home in a box.

40:20.501 --> 40:22.085
Don't make it two.

40:35.307 --> 40:37.183
Now take the noose off.

40:47.695 --> 40:50.280
Get now.
Take your brother back home.

40:50.448 --> 40:51.990
Don't let me
see you again.

41:04.628 --> 41:08.381
You go inside, you get
some things, and then you leave.

41:08.549 --> 41:10.258
Go to Boston,
go to Philadelphia --

41:10.426 --> 41:11.843
just go someplace else.

41:12.011 --> 41:14.429
But Aurelia, I --
I'll see to her.

41:14.597 --> 41:18.183
The way things are with Bullen,
he won't let you be now.

41:18.350 --> 41:20.185
You're as good as dead
in Alexandria.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.900
Frank, I know.

41:27.067 --> 41:29.652
I know what happened.

41:29.820 --> 41:35.575
That Tom's death wasn't...
How you said it was.

41:35.743 --> 41:38.411
Where did you hear
such a lie?

41:38.579 --> 41:42.373
The chaplain found out
the wound was self-inflicted.

41:42.541 --> 41:47.128
And you'd believe
that holy Joe over me?

41:47.296 --> 41:48.671
Are you falling for him?

41:48.839 --> 41:49.923
A yankee nonetheless?

41:50.090 --> 41:52.800
No, but I wanted
the truth.

41:52.968 --> 41:55.136
And I didn't get it
from you.

41:55.304 --> 41:57.222
I-I understand
why you did it.

41:57.389 --> 41:59.766
They spin their lies,
so we spin ours --

41:59.934 --> 42:02.852
all to strengthen
our will.

42:03.020 --> 42:05.355
But I'm not a soldier.

42:05.523 --> 42:09.776
And I'm not a child who needs to
be shielded from the truth.

42:09.944 --> 42:11.986
I didn't want you to think

42:12.154 --> 42:16.032
it was all for nothing,
what we did.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.660
What we're...Doing.

42:18.827 --> 42:21.287
I didn't want you to lose faith
because of it.

42:21.455 --> 42:22.705
Of course I wouldn't.

42:22.873 --> 42:26.084
Good, 'cause I am working

42:26.252 --> 42:28.670
for the knights
of the golden circle now.

42:28.837 --> 42:30.713
They are prepared
to do anything.

42:30.881 --> 42:32.131
There are things
you may hear of,

42:32.299 --> 42:34.968
things I might
be involved in...

42:35.135 --> 42:37.929
I never want you
to doubt.

42:43.394 --> 42:45.103
Did you run, soldier?

42:48.357 --> 42:49.816
Did you?

42:52.111 --> 42:54.654
Anyone can get scared in battle,
make a mistake.

42:54.822 --> 42:57.156
This was
my second time trying.

43:01.161 --> 43:03.663
My wife, addy, she...

43:06.083 --> 43:11.045
She sent me letters daily,
each more dire than the last.

43:11.213 --> 43:17.510
Our farm is in trouble,
my child's health is failing.

43:17.678 --> 43:20.054
Got too much
to handle alone.

43:22.641 --> 43:26.477
There's a man in town
more than happy to lend a hand.

43:26.645 --> 43:32.525
She started to think that I...
I was never coming home.

43:32.693 --> 43:35.862
She stopped answering
my letters.

43:36.030 --> 43:38.781
You felt you had to
make a choice?

43:38.949 --> 43:41.409
I chose my family.

43:58.469 --> 44:01.804
I know what it is to feel
you are failing a loved one.

44:04.099 --> 44:06.225
I've felt that myself.

44:12.775 --> 44:14.651
They sent word to her
that I was here,

44:14.818 --> 44:17.945
but I've heard nothing.

44:18.113 --> 44:21.908
Do you think I will?

44:22.076 --> 44:26.537
As a woman...Do you?

44:31.377 --> 44:33.461
I'm sure of it.

44:37.132 --> 44:39.967
Rest now.

44:50.938 --> 44:53.898
Dr. hale, you led me to believe
he was beyond saving.

44:54.066 --> 44:55.149
Is it so?

44:55.317 --> 44:57.777
Or is it only
your moral diagnosis?

44:57.945 --> 45:01.656
This hospital has limited
resources, Miss Phinney.

45:01.824 --> 45:03.950
Whom do you think
should go without care?

45:04.118 --> 45:06.494
A soldier who performed his duty
with honor?

45:06.662 --> 45:08.246
Or one who took
a French leave?

45:08.414 --> 45:09.747
His wife needed him.
His child --

45:09.915 --> 45:11.624
lies.

45:11.792 --> 45:14.502
A true muggins will never
acknowledge the corn,

45:14.670 --> 45:16.087
especially when facing
the great beyond.

45:16.255 --> 45:17.630
It is not for us
to decide.

45:17.798 --> 45:19.465
I gave you
explicit instruction --

45:19.633 --> 45:22.635
every man has a right to mercy,
no matter his sins.

45:22.803 --> 45:25.471
I would insist on it
for any soldier.

45:25.639 --> 45:27.014
Even you, sir.

45:28.642 --> 45:29.976
He's a hospital rat,
Miss Phinney.

45:30.144 --> 45:31.352
Don't be taken in.

45:34.314 --> 45:37.442
Bullen -- he sent
those men after you?

45:37.609 --> 45:40.903
I'm sorry you had to find out,
but it's better you know.

45:41.071 --> 45:44.866
Silas has no intention of
bringing your boy to Alexandria.

45:45.033 --> 45:46.075
Never did.

45:46.243 --> 45:47.535
He made me a promise!

45:47.703 --> 45:49.495
Which he'll never honor.

45:49.663 --> 45:51.998
It was all
just a nasty game to him.

45:52.166 --> 45:54.083
You got to believe that,
don't you?

45:54.251 --> 45:57.962
'Cause otherwise
you ruined it --

45:58.130 --> 46:01.466
me getting back the only thing
that mattered to me.

46:01.633 --> 46:03.760
It was for you!

46:03.927 --> 46:06.888
I's hanging from a rope
for trying to protect you!

46:08.891 --> 46:11.267
Please, no, I'm sorry.

46:14.605 --> 46:17.148
It's just...

46:17.316 --> 46:19.400
I care for you.

46:19.568 --> 46:21.444
I do.

46:24.281 --> 46:26.032
Leave with me.

46:26.200 --> 46:29.786
I can't.

46:29.953 --> 46:32.246
Don't you see?

46:32.414 --> 46:34.832
I's waiting
for my Gabriel.

46:38.879 --> 46:40.797
The doctor's right.

46:40.964 --> 46:45.426
It ain't safe for you here,
not if you stay on my account

46:45.594 --> 46:48.763
'cause you think
there's something for us.

46:48.931 --> 46:52.642
Well...

46:52.810 --> 46:54.894
We better off without it.

46:59.525 --> 47:02.860
I hope your findings allow you
to be kind

47:03.028 --> 47:05.530
when reporting
back to your superiors.

47:05.697 --> 47:08.282
Don't fret.
I will be kind, indeed.

47:08.450 --> 47:11.452
As will I, Dr. summers.

47:11.620 --> 47:14.831
Miss Evans,
you will be reporting

47:14.998 --> 47:17.416
to the, um, inspector general,
as well?

47:17.584 --> 47:23.464
No, I am the personal attaché
to the first lady, Mrs. Lincoln.

47:23.632 --> 47:27.176
Oh, I am sorry. I --
I didn't realize...

47:27.344 --> 47:28.678
You weren't meant to.

47:28.846 --> 47:30.054
The purpose
of my visit here

47:30.222 --> 47:32.682
was best accomplished
without fanfare.

47:32.850 --> 47:36.310
Might I ask...
What was that purpose?

47:36.478 --> 47:38.020
To determine
whether mansion house is

47:38.188 --> 47:41.232
a suitable venue
for the first lady's itinerary.

47:41.400 --> 47:43.234
And?

47:43.402 --> 47:46.028
Mrs. Lincoln is not afraid
of real life, Dr. summers,

47:46.196 --> 47:47.530
she embraces it.

47:47.698 --> 47:50.116
So, expect a visit
from her and the president

47:50.284 --> 47:53.035
both soon
in the very near future.

48:03.380 --> 48:07.466
Long day?

48:07.634 --> 48:10.136
Is there
any other kind?

48:19.605 --> 48:22.607
I lied to a man today.

48:22.774 --> 48:24.025
I told him he'd be hearing
from his wife

48:24.192 --> 48:26.277
when I'm quite certain
he will not.

48:28.864 --> 48:32.742
There can be mercy
in a certain kind of deception.

48:32.910 --> 48:35.369
So, mercy is
making a liar of me?

48:38.540 --> 48:40.750
The man is a deserter.

48:40.918 --> 48:44.921
And so hale has deserted him --
left him to die.

48:48.008 --> 48:50.968
I would ask
that you see him.

48:51.136 --> 48:52.845
Mm.

48:57.726 --> 49:01.938
About this morning,
I should have said --

49:02.105 --> 49:08.027
or rather
I should have asked --

49:08.195 --> 49:10.154
may I call you "Mary"?

49:13.784 --> 49:15.493
You already have.

49:23.835 --> 49:24.961
Have you seen Samuel?

49:25.128 --> 49:26.504
I needed his help
with some meals,

49:26.672 --> 49:28.214
but he's
nowhere to be found.

49:32.678 --> 49:34.178
Mr. Diggs is gone.

49:37.683 --> 49:39.809
I don't think
we'll be seeing him again.

50:04.167 --> 50:06.377
I'm sorry
to have kept you waiting.

50:06.545 --> 50:08.546
I made sure
I wasn't followed.

50:08.714 --> 50:12.383
I must say, sir, what a pleasure
it is to meet you.

50:12.551 --> 50:15.344
I saw you in "Richard III"
last year.

50:15.512 --> 50:17.722
My family went to
Richmond for it.

50:17.889 --> 50:21.142
Wonderful, really.
I...The hump --

50:21.309 --> 50:24.186
so...Uh, realistic.

50:24.354 --> 50:28.107
The hump...Is merely
the external representation

50:28.275 --> 50:30.609
of what's happening
in here.

50:30.777 --> 50:33.654
Yes. Of course.

50:33.822 --> 50:35.322
Now, as to
the matter at hand,

50:35.490 --> 50:37.658
that hospital you have
access to, the mansion house,

50:37.826 --> 50:40.536
it's been determined today
that dishonest Abe

50:40.704 --> 50:42.496
shall be visiting there
within the next two weeks.

50:42.664 --> 50:45.207
We need your help
in order to implement a plan.

50:45.375 --> 50:47.043
What sort of a plan?

50:51.339 --> 50:54.341
We're going to blow that place
to kingdom come.

50:57.387 --> 50:59.680
It was a reckless action.

50:59.848 --> 51:02.016
I thought they might shoot you
on the spot.

51:02.184 --> 51:04.310
They need me too much
to shoot me.

51:04.478 --> 51:06.729
Those boys didn't seem
clever enough to know that.

51:06.897 --> 51:10.191
What will happen now, papa,
when they find out the truth?

51:10.358 --> 51:11.817
I'll work it out
with the provost.

51:11.985 --> 51:14.320
The vital thing is that Tom's
in his final resting place

51:14.488 --> 51:17.198
and his mother has
some small comfort.

51:18.950 --> 51:21.786
Father...
I-I'm amazed.

51:21.953 --> 51:24.288
I did what
I promised I'd do.

51:24.456 --> 51:26.332
Oh, it was much more
than that.

51:26.500 --> 51:28.125
You did
the Green name proud.

51:31.088 --> 51:33.380
To Tom,
who gave his life

51:33.548 --> 51:36.300
in courageous defense
of the confederacy.

51:36.468 --> 51:37.593
To Tom.

51:37.761 --> 51:39.595
And to my father,

51:39.763 --> 51:42.223
who honored
that sacrifice today.

51:42.390 --> 51:43.974
To father.

51:50.148 --> 51:54.568
Excuse me.
Union men here to see you, sir.

52:02.536 --> 52:05.955
James Green? You're hereby
placed under arrest.

52:06.123 --> 52:07.123
Why?!
What is this?!

52:07.290 --> 52:08.582
Lying to
a United States officer,

52:08.750 --> 52:10.126
violating the union
authority's rules

52:10.293 --> 52:12.128
by burying a rebel
in a union-controlled cemetery,

52:12.295 --> 52:14.004
and various counts
of treasonous subversion.

52:14.172 --> 52:16.423
Father!
Major, I beg
of you, please --

52:16.591 --> 52:18.008
do not follow!

52:21.680 --> 52:23.389
No!
Oh, my God.
