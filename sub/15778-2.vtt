00:03.324 --> 00:06.691
- Gary! Phone!
- Mom, we're busy!

00:06.727 --> 00:07.928
- Gary!
- What?!

00:07.929 --> 00:11.431
- Phone!
- Fine! Have a cow, why don't you?

00:11.432 --> 00:15.035
- Atomic comic collection connection...
- Shut up! l know.

00:15.036 --> 00:17.437
- What are you doing?
- Working. Hang on.

00:17.438 --> 00:20.307
Atomic comic collection connection.
Your on-line...

00:20.308 --> 00:23.076
- 21, this is The Monarch speaking.
- Boss? Holy crud!

00:23.077 --> 00:25.645
l got 24 on the other line.
l'll put us on three-way.

00:25.646 --> 00:27.414
Good. l want him to hear this, too.

00:27.415 --> 00:30.217
- Dude, it's The Monarch.
- Hey, boss. How's prison?

00:30.218 --> 00:33.220
Well, l'm out. No thanks to you schmucks!
Guess where l am now?

00:33.221 --> 00:35.489
- At a good friend's house?
- At a Best Western?

00:35.490 --> 00:40.460
l am sitting in the charred remains
of my once mighty flying cocoon.

00:40.461 --> 00:43.930
Anyone wanna explain to me
why my cocoon is charred?

00:43.931 --> 00:46.099
Because you told us
to destroy the cocoon?

00:46.100 --> 00:49.069
- And why it is sideways?!
- We were following orders!

00:49.070 --> 00:52.973
- You can't yell at us for following orders!
- Or kill us for following orders.

00:52.974 --> 00:56.109
Never mind. Just summon
the others and get over here.

00:56.110 --> 00:57.444
There are no others.

00:57.445 --> 01:01.248
Yeah, most of them joined up with
Monstroso's crew when you went inside.

01:01.249 --> 01:04.316
And we kinda
lost touch after that.

01:04.318 --> 01:06.553
l'm not gonna
lose my temper.

01:06.554 --> 01:08.955
All right,
here's what is going to happen.

01:08.956 --> 01:11.725
l'm going to take a shower
in what is left of my bathroom.

01:11.726 --> 01:13.527
When l get out,
l expect you to be here.

01:13.528 --> 01:19.538
And l expect this cocoon
to be fully manned and fully operational!

01:26.440 --> 01:30.443
- Awesome. We are back, dude.
- You heard him. l'll pick you up at 5:00.

01:30.444 --> 01:33.213
Be outside. l don't want
to have to talk to your mom.

01:33.214 --> 01:35.714
l will be there.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:54.268 --> 01:56.768
Daddy's home.

02:20.461 --> 02:24.271
Quit honking!
l heard you the first time.

02:27.902 --> 02:32.168
Lady! Lady, no!
Mom! Call the dog!

02:55.930 --> 02:58.430
The Grand Cooley Dam...

02:58.432 --> 03:02.335
the largest concrete structure
in the United States.

03:02.336 --> 03:06.306
Whatever.
Do they really need to know this?

03:07.708 --> 03:08.875
Happy fifth--

03:08.876 --> 03:13.246
Happy 16th birthday, boys.
Blow out your candle.

03:13.748 --> 03:16.883
Here, boys. Put these in your wallets.
You're official now.

03:16.884 --> 03:19.986
- How come they're all burned up?
- Laminating accident.

03:19.987 --> 03:23.189
- They're still good though.
- You sure? 'Cause this date is wrong.

03:23.190 --> 03:26.326
- lf l was born this year...
- Curiosity kills more than the cat.

03:26.327 --> 03:30.263
Put them in your wallets, like the man said,
and get dressed. We have a big day ahead.

03:30.264 --> 03:33.400
Are you the bully of your school
or even the victim of bullying?

03:33.401 --> 03:36.169
Do you watch movies
about costumed heroes and think...

03:36.170 --> 03:40.006
''That guy's a pussy. l sure hope
a much cooler bad guy kicks his ass.''

03:40.007 --> 03:43.677
- lt's like you're reading my mind.
- l am not a mind reader, stranger.

03:43.678 --> 03:48.181
You, like so many others, are drawn
to the sexy action-packed lifestyle...

03:48.182 --> 03:50.016
of the professional henchman.

03:50.017 --> 03:52.018
But l could never be a henchman.

03:52.019 --> 03:56.256
l am just a normal guy
who is between the age of 18 and 30...

03:56.257 --> 03:59.826
a loner, and lacks ties
to friends and family.

03:59.827 --> 04:03.363
You, stranger are the perfect candidate
for costumed aggression.

04:03.364 --> 04:05.498
Yo, fat boy.
We get to carry a piece?

04:05.499 --> 04:08.535
But of course!
Your standard Grade One henchman...

04:08.536 --> 04:13.006
in service of the mighty Monarch is issued
a dart gun and a grappling cannon...

04:13.007 --> 04:16.076
to name only a few
of the exciting accoutrements...

04:16.077 --> 04:20.279
that will aid the henchman
in his wondrous world of career henching.

04:20.281 --> 04:21.648
What kinda ride we get?

04:21.649 --> 04:24.918
How does an enormous
flying cocoon sound to you?

04:24.919 --> 04:28.788
A flying cocoon?
l can already feel my life getting better!

04:28.789 --> 04:30.223
? The mighty Monarch ?

04:30.224 --> 04:32.724
? Around the world ?

04:34.829 --> 04:37.329
No way.

04:39.633 --> 04:41.034
Are we floating?

04:41.035 --> 04:42.368
- Hey, boss!
- Welcome back!

04:42.369 --> 04:45.271
- You actually did what l told you?
- Yeah. We are up and running.

04:45.272 --> 04:48.641
The new guys stole some parts
from Sergeant Hatred's hover tank...

04:48.642 --> 04:51.711
which is cool but broken now.
So there's a couple of issues.

04:51.712 --> 04:52.812
Let me do this.

04:52.813 --> 04:56.483
You know that 21 and l have been
working for you for, like, ever, right?

04:56.484 --> 04:59.552
And we think it's about time
we were given new numbers.

04:59.553 --> 05:01.721
- Like one and two.
- Or two and one.

05:01.722 --> 05:05.325
- Fine, whatever.
- Yeah, like it's that easy. No, listen to this.

05:05.326 --> 05:07.627
Henchman 28!
Front and center!

05:07.628 --> 05:10.029
You want me?
You roll your big ass over here!

05:10.030 --> 05:12.665
And l'm done told you
my name is #1!

05:12.666 --> 05:16.169
l like that! Shows initiative!
Seems like you collected...

05:16.170 --> 05:20.039
the perfect team of go-getters
to carry out my brilliant new plan.

05:20.040 --> 05:22.909
Operation Get Back Dr. Girlfriend!

05:22.910 --> 05:26.209
#1, it's time you met your leader!

05:26.247 --> 05:27.580
The Monar--

05:27.581 --> 05:30.650
What the...?!
Get that off your head!

05:30.651 --> 05:32.018
l smell weed.

05:32.019 --> 05:34.187
Can't you give me
just a little hint?

05:34.188 --> 05:38.725
And ruin the surprise?
No, sirree Bob. l wish l was you.

05:38.726 --> 05:41.227
This was a big day for me
when l was your age.

05:41.228 --> 05:43.196
- Hi. May l help you?
- Yes, you may.

05:43.197 --> 05:47.801
l would like to fit the lucky birthday boy
for his first speedsuit.

05:47.802 --> 05:50.303
Great. And what is a speedsuit?

05:50.304 --> 05:52.038
What is a speedsuit?

05:52.039 --> 05:54.974
Only the perfect habiliment
for the science-minded man...

05:54.975 --> 05:58.478
who knows both comfort and ease
and demands them from his clothing.

05:58.479 --> 06:00.547
ln a speedsuit,
you say to the world...

06:00.548 --> 06:04.617
''Look out! l know what l'm wearing
for the rest of my life!''

06:04.618 --> 06:08.288
That's a short-sleeved jumpsuit. Check
the workwear department in the back.

06:08.289 --> 06:10.957
- My big surprise is a jumpsuit?
- Speedsuit.

06:10.958 --> 06:17.096
l don't want to hear you ever say jumpsuit,
Dean, not ever. Speedsuit.

06:17.097 --> 06:19.930
There she is! Follow her!

06:19.967 --> 06:22.468
Steady. Steady now.
Keep your distance.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.969
Yeah. Fly casual.

06:25.472 --> 06:30.162
She's standing around. Quick!
Evasive maneuvers now!

06:31.045 --> 06:35.895
- Something wrong?
- No. l thought l forgot something.

06:36.050 --> 06:38.550
Of course.

06:38.586 --> 06:40.887
l look like Santa's magic janitor.

06:40.888 --> 06:43.690
Nonsense.
You look like a million bucks.

06:43.691 --> 06:47.527
And you were right. The pipe main seams
on the explorer model were too showy.

06:47.528 --> 06:51.798
This one is elegantly understated
and the color has a dancer flair to it.

06:51.799 --> 06:56.202
- How does it fit in the seat?
- Pop! There are people around!

06:56.203 --> 07:00.607
You'll want a sleek profile yet roomy.
A properly fit speedsuit should crotch...

07:00.608 --> 07:03.176
at least six inches
below your natural inseam.

07:03.177 --> 07:05.712
- Can l take this off now?
- How is everything going?

07:05.713 --> 07:07.313
- Will you be taking that?
- No.

07:07.314 --> 07:09.515
Yes, ma'am!
And don't bother wrapping it up.

07:09.516 --> 07:12.986
The future super scientist
will be wearing it out.

07:12.987 --> 07:14.821
Magnificent.

07:14.822 --> 07:19.359
Finally someone who understands
that serration is only good for bread.

07:19.360 --> 07:21.988
That is so great.

07:22.029 --> 07:23.930
You know how we shall celebrate?

07:23.931 --> 07:28.067
Yes! Dinner party.
l will begin a marinade tonight.

07:28.068 --> 07:31.638
We shall invite Manta Claus and Animus.
No, wait. That's awkward.

07:31.639 --> 07:35.408
Phantom, honestly.
l am finding this so hard to care about.

07:35.409 --> 07:38.411
You have to feel the heft
to really appreciate it.

07:38.412 --> 07:42.282
Shopkeeper, the lady would
like to inspect the WÃ¼sthofs!

07:42.283 --> 07:44.851
Well, l'm gonna get a nosh.
You coming?

07:44.852 --> 07:48.488
And suffer the embarrassment of not
having enough pickle forks for the party?

07:48.489 --> 07:52.357
No, my queen.
There is much to procure.

07:52.393 --> 07:55.728
- Because mine got broken, that's why.
- Jeez.

07:55.729 --> 07:58.231
- How did that happen?
- l don't know, Hank.

07:58.232 --> 08:02.812
Probably when somebody
was playing with it. Go on!

08:04.705 --> 08:07.440
- Come on with that!
- Sorry, sir.

08:07.441 --> 08:09.941
Yeah, keep walking.

08:10.110 --> 08:12.610
He crept away!

08:14.882 --> 08:17.083
Hi.

08:17.084 --> 08:18.851
l forgive you.

08:18.852 --> 08:22.889
- What do you think you're doing?
- Butterfly kisses. Learned it in prison.

08:22.890 --> 08:27.093
What, are you gonna pretend that
we just accidentally ran into each other?

08:27.094 --> 08:30.563
You know, do that
''Fancy meeting you here'' routine?!

08:30.564 --> 08:31.731
No? l guess...

08:31.732 --> 08:35.934
Could it be that you were tailing me
in a gigantic floating cocoon?

08:35.936 --> 08:39.639
By the way, tell 24 that the cloak mode
doesn't work in fourth gear.

08:39.640 --> 08:42.700
See? We need you!
Come back!

08:42.743 --> 08:46.579
Everything is crazy! The henchmen
cry themselves to sleep at night.

08:46.580 --> 08:51.884
l think the cocoon is probably really...
busted, l don't know, l can't even tell.

08:51.885 --> 08:55.455
There's...there's just so many buttons.

08:56.357 --> 08:58.224
So many buttons!

08:58.225 --> 09:01.928
- Cut to the chase, Monarch.
- Don't you want to console me?

09:01.929 --> 09:03.162
Why do you want me back?

09:03.163 --> 09:06.499
Because your tree fort is falling apart
or because you love me?

09:06.500 --> 09:08.601
Because l love you! Because...

09:08.602 --> 09:12.372
Because when l'd lay my world-weary brow
on your perfect breasts...

09:12.373 --> 09:18.077
and feel the phlegmy rumble of your chest
as you told me, ''This is heaven''...

09:18.078 --> 09:19.178
l believed you.

09:19.179 --> 09:23.216
You can't do that.
When you threw me out, l was devastated.

09:23.217 --> 09:26.786
l would have come home
if you asked me to. Yes, l'm that stupid.

09:26.787 --> 09:28.888
But you didn't.
You called me a whore...

09:28.889 --> 09:31.858
and you went back to your
l'll-get-you-Dr.-Venture shenanigans.

09:31.859 --> 09:33.126
- Boss?
- What do you want?

09:33.127 --> 09:35.661
- Code blue!
- l want you to grow up! But it's late now.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.997
- You'll never guess who just walked in!
- Who?

09:37.998 --> 09:40.700
- You know damn well l'm staying...
- Dr. Venture.

09:40.701 --> 09:43.369
- Holy crap!
- What do you want us to do?

09:43.370 --> 09:44.437
- Move in!!
- What?

09:44.438 --> 09:45.671
Move in with me!

09:45.672 --> 09:48.007
Do you want me
to share the bedroom with you?

09:48.008 --> 09:51.944
No, don't be an a-hole!
l was talking to... l was talking...

09:51.945 --> 09:54.414
You were talking to who?
To your henchmen.

09:54.415 --> 09:56.616
l don't believe l was falling for this!

09:56.617 --> 09:58.117
You haven't changed at all!

09:58.118 --> 10:01.054
Let me tell you something about Limb.
He's an animal...

10:01.055 --> 10:02.989
Does he know this channel's open?

10:02.990 --> 10:07.593
Who gave him the map?
What the ... is up with this female?

10:07.594 --> 10:09.962
Ease up on him.
He's been through a lot.

10:09.963 --> 10:11.831
The man's heart has been broken.

10:11.832 --> 10:15.001
l am leaving!
Call me when you can act like an adult.

10:15.002 --> 10:16.502
l am an adult!

10:16.503 --> 10:18.838
- Let me go!
- Please, just let me...

10:18.839 --> 10:21.007
- Come on, Monarch.
- Stay for me.

10:21.008 --> 10:23.676
Get your hands off of me.
l'm getting tired of this.

10:23.677 --> 10:26.617
Monarch, unhand her this instant!

10:32.252 --> 10:33.853
Come on! You!

10:33.854 --> 10:36.524
#2 with fried rice, get down!

10:42.763 --> 10:44.997
There you are.
We're almost ready.

10:44.998 --> 10:47.100
Just had to swing
by the Shoe Shack.

10:47.101 --> 10:51.904
l spotted the perfect ltalian ankle boots
to complete Dean's ensemble.

10:51.905 --> 10:57.115
- Don't say it.
- You look like the Mayor of Candy Land.

10:57.344 --> 11:00.304
lt's an ambush.
Boys, get back!

11:03.617 --> 11:06.018
Can you read my mind?

11:06.019 --> 11:09.021
Do you know what it is
that you do to me?

11:09.022 --> 11:12.549
Here l am like a kid out of school.

11:12.593 --> 11:16.613
Holding hands with the goddess.
l'm a fool.

11:20.334 --> 11:24.237
Son of a... God!
My glasses! Where are my glasses?

11:24.238 --> 11:27.573
Where are my glasses?
Has anybody seen...? Excuse me.

11:27.574 --> 11:30.243
Oh, my God. Thank...
What's going...

11:30.244 --> 11:32.744
l'm gonna throw up.

11:34.581 --> 11:39.181
Only one shot at this.
You can do it, Duffy Moon!

11:39.987 --> 11:43.156
What the...?
You want some of this?

11:43.157 --> 11:45.657
Damn you, Nerf!

11:50.430 --> 11:51.864
What the hell was that?

11:51.865 --> 11:54.365
No!

12:04.344 --> 12:06.279
S--! Mall cops!

12:06.280 --> 12:08.780
Henchmen! Retreat!

12:12.819 --> 12:16.448
l won't let you keep her, Monarch.

12:16.490 --> 12:18.990
Hello. What's this?

12:27.000 --> 12:28.868
What the...?

12:28.869 --> 12:32.038
You're probably wondering
why l haven't killed you.

12:32.039 --> 12:34.040
l'm wondering
where the hell l am.

12:34.041 --> 12:35.708
The lair of the Phantom.

12:35.709 --> 12:37.376
Behind these modest walls...

12:37.377 --> 12:42.048
lies the most technologically advanced
system of controlled evil in existence.

12:42.049 --> 12:47.053
You, sir, are sitting smack dab
in the middle of location ''B''...

12:47.054 --> 12:50.204
for the Guild of Calamitous lntent!

12:50.824 --> 12:52.558
You like doing that, don't you?

12:52.559 --> 12:55.761
Yes. Next to the ''Behold
a giant walking death ray'' speech...

12:55.762 --> 12:59.398
the ''Welcome to hell'' speech
is my favorite. No, don't get up.

12:59.399 --> 13:02.235
You've been shot.
Sadly, it wasn't fatal.

13:02.236 --> 13:05.171
l have removed the bullet.
And three others.

13:05.172 --> 13:08.040
A blowgun dart, two shark's teeth,
the tip of a bayonet...

13:08.041 --> 13:10.876
a twisted paper clip,
and a meager handful of buckshot.

13:10.877 --> 13:13.879
- You may want to learn how to duck.
- ln a couple of minutes...

13:13.880 --> 13:16.816
l'm gonna get up and pound
your smug face into that armrest.

13:16.817 --> 13:20.486
So why don't you spend your last minutes
of life telling me what went down?

13:20.487 --> 13:24.190
lt seems that our mutual pest,
The Monarch, has himself a death wish.

13:24.191 --> 13:27.627
He operates in full costumed aggression
without a Guild license.

13:27.628 --> 13:31.364
His henchmen are using Level 5
offensive weapons for a Level 1 threat...

13:31.365 --> 13:35.201
no offense to Dr. Venture,
and he's kidnapped my girlfriend.

13:35.202 --> 13:40.906
- So, what are you gonna do about it?
- Not me. We. l left out one small detail.

13:40.907 --> 13:43.876
The Monarch also kidnapped
your entire family.

13:43.877 --> 13:48.247
The most reckless, graceless exhibition
of henchmen that l've ever seen!

13:48.248 --> 13:51.751
You think you're all a bunch of hotshot
young Turk 182s, don't you?

13:51.752 --> 13:54.854
Well, there are rules in this business!
lt's about finesse.

13:54.855 --> 13:57.556
You don't just go in,
guns a-blazing, willy-nilly.

13:57.557 --> 14:02.495
Where did you get real guns anyway?
Are those standard issue? Hand them over!

14:02.496 --> 14:09.796
What, is this funny to you? l said
hand over your firearm, or l'll be forced...

14:11.271 --> 14:12.438
Wait a minute, hold up!

14:12.439 --> 14:15.308
- Who are you?!
- Keep up! Where are you parked?

14:15.309 --> 14:17.343
- Where am l what?
- Where's your car?

14:17.344 --> 14:19.445
- l don't have...
- We came in our bodyguard's car, why?

14:19.446 --> 14:23.316
Because my ex-boyfriend, the idiot,
kidnapped your father and Brock...

14:23.317 --> 14:24.950
and probably my current beau.

14:24.951 --> 14:27.386
And you two
are gonna take me to him, now!

14:27.387 --> 14:29.388
Yes! Wait!
How do you know Brock?

14:29.389 --> 14:31.857
Here it is!

14:31.858 --> 14:34.026
- Aren't you gonna...?
- Hank, you drive!

14:34.027 --> 14:36.962
- l never drive mad.
- Brock would never let us drive his...

14:36.963 --> 14:40.066
Don't be such a candy-ass, Dean.
Get in the back.

14:40.067 --> 14:43.135
- How do you know my name?
- You heard the woman, candy-ass.

14:43.136 --> 14:45.636
Wait a sec.

14:46.473 --> 14:47.573
OK, get in.

14:47.574 --> 14:49.742
How do you know all this stuff, lady?!

14:49.743 --> 14:52.812
l number two'd for Truckulese
when l was first starting out.

14:52.813 --> 14:54.313
l can hotwire anything.

14:54.314 --> 14:58.384
No, l mean how did
you know it was gonna...

14:59.319 --> 15:01.320
Ten o'clock. Two o'clock.

15:01.321 --> 15:02.822
You can do this, Hank.

15:02.823 --> 15:06.092
That pedal on your left, that's the clutch.
Put your foot on it.

15:06.093 --> 15:07.927
Now shift into first gear.

15:07.928 --> 15:12.298
See that little diagram on the knob?
With that little one on it?

15:12.299 --> 15:15.632
Wait a minute.
Are you our mommy?

15:23.176 --> 15:24.610
Nice.

15:24.611 --> 15:27.847
lt's unbearable.
First, a mutiny, and now...

15:27.848 --> 15:31.117
l can't believe l'm sharing
the same air as my sworn enemy!

15:31.118 --> 15:34.854
And l can't even breathe!
l'm drowning in my own hate!

15:34.855 --> 15:37.223
God, what is it
with this obsession of yours?

15:37.224 --> 15:40.860
- What did l ever do to you?
- How dare you?! As if you...

15:40.861 --> 15:44.463
- Frankly, it's beginning to get a bit old.
- And then to belittle my...

15:44.464 --> 15:48.534
These two!
l would love to smack that smug...

15:48.535 --> 15:52.605
Oh, my God, guys. Chill, chill!
lf we're gonna get out of this alive...

15:52.606 --> 15:56.442
you two are gonna have to put aside
your differences and work together!

15:56.443 --> 15:58.077
Now, l think l got an idea.

15:58.078 --> 16:02.081
lf we can get our hands on some weapons,
we can totally take these guys.

16:02.082 --> 16:03.115
Yeah. No, duh!

16:03.116 --> 16:06.485
But if, just if, we weren't locked
in a cell or haven't you noticed?

16:06.486 --> 16:08.788
The armory's
on the other side of the cocoon!

16:08.789 --> 16:13.225
- We'd have to cross the Throne Room.
- Where those guys are. Those scary guys.

16:13.226 --> 16:17.263
OK. We don't even need the armory.
l'm talking about my own personal stash.

16:17.264 --> 16:20.266
And we happen to be standing
right under my room.

16:20.267 --> 16:23.235
Trust me. We can climb
through the air ducts.

16:23.236 --> 16:26.906
- There's no way you're fitting in that thing.
- Yeah, no.

16:26.907 --> 16:29.175
You're just too heavy.

16:29.176 --> 16:32.044
- What the hell is that?!
- Muscle growth accelerator.

16:32.045 --> 16:36.482
Just a little nostalgic item from back
when l was a scientific goody-goody.

16:36.483 --> 16:40.019
Not unlike your Dr. Venture.
No, wait! l was good at it.

16:40.020 --> 16:43.322
What is it with you dicks?
The minute an experiment messes up...

16:43.323 --> 16:47.693
you sell yourself a pair of tight pajamas,
and become a professional pain in my...

16:47.694 --> 16:49.895
- Turn that down!
- Deal with it, tough guy.

16:49.896 --> 16:52.932
And l don't need a clumsy bully
making a mess of this.

16:52.933 --> 16:55.835
lf this little incident gets out,
my career is done for.

16:55.836 --> 16:58.471
This will be handled surgically and quietly.

16:58.472 --> 17:03.309
Yeah, we team up like Scully and Mulder
and solve mysteries. Been over this.

17:03.310 --> 17:07.480
l know that you love playing make-believe
but a lunatic has kidnapped my family...

17:07.481 --> 17:09.482
and l'm going to do
something about it!

17:09.483 --> 17:11.983
Not without me.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.388
- There we go.
- ''Good call on the WD-40''...

17:17.390 --> 17:19.058
said The Monarch grudgingly.

17:19.059 --> 17:23.162
- Never go anywhere without it. But thanks.
- l have to admit, you proved us wrong.

17:23.163 --> 17:27.066
Yeah, yeah. Keep laughing
while l totally emancipate you.

17:27.067 --> 17:29.797
Gentlemen, choose your weapons.

17:30.303 --> 17:32.204
- ls this them?
- ''Are these they?''

17:32.205 --> 17:35.541
- Who talks like that?
- Out of the way! l am the leader here!

17:35.542 --> 17:38.170
l will distribute the...

17:40.247 --> 17:42.081
- Are these they?
- Yeah.

17:42.082 --> 17:47.482
And you have to admit
it is a pretty formidable collection.

17:47.854 --> 17:51.190
You --ing idiot! What the hell
are we supposed to do with this crap?

17:51.191 --> 17:54.426
Make them laugh so hard
they blow malt liquor out of their noses?

17:54.427 --> 17:56.395
No, l think you'll have that covered...

17:56.396 --> 18:00.132
when you storm the room
in butterfly costumes.

18:00.133 --> 18:01.567
Nice onesie, Dick.

18:01.568 --> 18:04.470
Does it have snaps in the back,
so you can make poopies?

18:04.471 --> 18:08.207
This is a speedsuit, mister.
Not a onesie!

18:08.208 --> 18:12.378
Maybe they'll think you're a three-year-old
with progeria and take pity on us.

18:12.379 --> 18:15.047
- ln your face!
- Would you stop that?! Look...

18:15.048 --> 18:19.184
this is extra-amusing and everything,
but we've got us a cocoon to take back!

18:19.185 --> 18:22.521
- With toys.
- Toys schmoys. Check this action.

18:22.522 --> 18:25.858
An official, licensed
Lord of the Ring replica sword.

18:25.859 --> 18:27.493
Now we're talkin'!

18:27.494 --> 18:29.995
What are you doing!?
That is mint in box!

18:29.996 --> 18:34.333
Not even a scar? Did you look
around the nipple or the belly button?

18:34.334 --> 18:37.736
- Sometimes they put 'em in through there.
- Look, she is all woman.

18:37.737 --> 18:40.506
l've explored every inch of her
and l found only nectar.

18:40.507 --> 18:43.509
All right, fine. Maybe
The Monarch's just better equipped.

18:43.510 --> 18:45.644
You are strapping on
an ultra-light gyropack.

18:45.645 --> 18:48.180
They're only issued
to top-ranking Guild operatives.

18:48.181 --> 18:52.651
- No, l mean better...equipped.
- She was kidnapped, all right?!

18:52.652 --> 18:54.820
- Kidnapped!
- l'm just sayin'.

18:54.821 --> 18:56.522
- Are you ready?
- How do you...?

18:56.523 --> 19:01.093
Up, down, side, side. Ready weapon.
Left hand, operate speed and targeting.

19:01.094 --> 19:02.528
Just like a helicopter.

19:02.529 --> 19:05.164
- Just like my kind of helicopter.
- Let's go.

19:05.165 --> 19:08.100
l thought for sure you were going
to hit me with lock and load.

19:08.101 --> 19:10.601
The night is still young!

19:10.670 --> 19:11.837
Left. Turn left.

19:11.838 --> 19:13.739
- l'm driving!
- Yes, we know.

19:13.740 --> 19:15.741
Mommy, how do you know where to go?

19:15.742 --> 19:18.611
l'm not your mommy!
And l put a tracer on The Monarch...

19:18.612 --> 19:21.246
when we were first dating.
Hank, take this right!

19:21.247 --> 19:23.182
l'm driving!
l'm a driver!

19:23.183 --> 19:24.350
We know!

19:24.351 --> 19:27.453
Yeah, tracer. You do stuff like that
when you date Supervillains.

19:27.454 --> 19:31.490
Where'd you put it? ls it in his brain,
or is it like a secret tracer tooth?

19:31.491 --> 19:35.427
l hid it in my mouth and l jammed it up...
Honey, like l said...

19:35.428 --> 19:40.966
you do some pretty strange things
when you date Supervillains.

19:40.967 --> 19:42.468
l'm still keeping this thing.

19:42.469 --> 19:45.304
lt's the first net cannon
l've used that actually works.

19:45.305 --> 19:49.541
- They usually just mess up the guy's hair.
- Prototype. l'll get you more net cartridges.

19:49.542 --> 19:54.246
Thanks. That killer hand is pretty cool.
Can you get me one of those?

19:54.247 --> 19:57.750
That's all me. The outcome
of a botched experiment that made me evil.

19:57.751 --> 20:01.286
l so called that.
So, we done here or what?

20:01.287 --> 20:02.888
lt's just those guys over there.

20:02.889 --> 20:05.557
l want them to show you
that twin double roll thing.

20:05.558 --> 20:08.460
You're mad, sir.
lt can't be done without a trampoline.

20:08.461 --> 20:12.564
Wait. Let me do this. You'll love this.
Follow my lead. Classic.

20:12.565 --> 20:15.227
Oh, sweet mercy!

20:15.268 --> 20:18.570
l've been rend asunder by your violence!

20:18.571 --> 20:22.029
Be merciful and finish me off.

20:22.075 --> 20:25.444
Have a heart!
Put one between his eyes!

20:25.445 --> 20:29.935
My God! Do l have to do it?
Give me those guns!

20:40.126 --> 20:43.195
Well met.
You do that with his own finger.

20:43.196 --> 20:46.865
- Yeah, it's just one guy.
- You show-off.

20:46.866 --> 20:49.366
My car.

20:49.969 --> 20:51.637
l just fixed that!

20:51.638 --> 20:53.305
- My queen!
- Brock!

20:53.306 --> 20:55.708
- Brock, l drove!
- Boys, you're all right!

20:55.709 --> 21:00.045
This is a joke! What the hell
is going on here? Where's Doc?

21:00.046 --> 21:02.681
What do you want me to do?
Read their fortunes?

21:02.682 --> 21:05.617
They are Magic: The Gathering cards,
not Tarot cards.

21:05.618 --> 21:07.219
You can fuzz 'em at their heads.

21:07.220 --> 21:10.556
You catch a corner with one of those
and they'll know what hit them.

21:10.557 --> 21:13.392
We'll get our asses kicked.
We didn't have a breakfast.

21:13.393 --> 21:16.895
Gentlemen, it's time
we take back the cocoon.

21:16.896 --> 21:20.866
Hands in the center.
Who would like to lead us in prayer?

21:20.867 --> 21:23.168
Smash puny humans.

21:23.169 --> 21:25.669
Did you hear something?

21:28.074 --> 21:30.702
On three. One, two!

21:31.344 --> 21:33.844
Three!

22:04.077 --> 22:07.246
Well, his vital signs seem to be fine.

22:07.247 --> 22:10.149
You told me you never put a tracer
on another man before.

22:10.150 --> 22:12.484
Glad l wasn't
the first one through the door.

22:12.485 --> 22:15.721
- Who are all these people?
- Are they all mommy's other boyfriends?

22:15.722 --> 22:19.158
Stop calling me your f-- mommy!
Come on, don't kill them.

22:19.159 --> 22:22.628
From what l've gathered, The Monarch
is only guilty of poor judgment...

22:22.629 --> 22:24.663
and not being able to get over me.

22:24.664 --> 22:27.399
As you wish, my queen.
He is only a man...

22:27.400 --> 22:30.569
and no man is immune to your charm.

22:30.570 --> 22:34.960
''No man.''
l'm still lookin' for scars on her.

22:35.208 --> 22:36.241
What?

22:36.242 --> 22:38.243
l'm a Supervillain.

22:38.244 --> 22:41.179
Qu'ils mangent de la soupe!
