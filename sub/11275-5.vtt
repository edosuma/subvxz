Sam, I found an apartment.      

00:09.100 --> 00:10.700
Hey, good for you, Woody.       

00:10.700 --> 00:12.400
      It's got everything       
         I ever wanted.         

00:12.500 --> 00:13.900
SAM:                            
What's that?

00:20.400 --> 00:22.500
Isn't this in Chinatown?        

00:23.900 --> 00:25.100
          I don't think so, Sam.

00:25.100 --> 00:27.600
    Well, yeah,                 
    I think it is.              

00:27.700 --> 00:30.500
Did there seem to be a lot      
 of Chinese restaurants around? 

00:30.500 --> 00:31.300
Yeah, I guess.                  

00:31.300 --> 00:32.600
                  And, uh, a lot

00:32.700 --> 00:35.300
of, uh, signs hanging hither    
and yon in Chinese there?       

00:35.300 --> 00:36.800
Yeah, come to think of it.      

00:36.800 --> 00:38.400
                  Yeah, lots of 
                  Chinese people
                  walking around

00:38.400 --> 00:39.400
                  on the street,
                  I suppose.    

00:39.400 --> 00:40.700
Yeah, but that could just       

00:40.700 --> 00:42.200
be a coincidence, you know?     

00:43.800 --> 00:44.900
                I'll tell you   
                what I'll do.   

00:44.900 --> 00:46.100
                    I'll call

         Any new twists

          ( <i>laughing</i> )

             Yeah.

            So, uh, that's      
            four, right, Sam?   

02:53.600 --> 02:54.500
            Mm-hmm.             

02:54.600 --> 02:57.400
I handle all the ordering       
around here now.                

02:57.500 --> 02:58.700
                Really, Sam?    

02:59.600 --> 03:02.000
            So how many cases   
            do you want?        

03:02.100 --> 03:03.200
How many did he say?            

03:03.200 --> 03:04.400
                Four.           

03:04.500 --> 03:05.800
I want five.                    

03:05.800 --> 03:08.500
                 She's the boss.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.400
      I'll call you later.      

03:10.500 --> 03:12.500
            I saw that little   
            wink, Mr. Malone,   

03:12.500 --> 03:14.000
                  and I don't   
                  appreciate it.

03:14.100 --> 03:17.000
    I'm tired of you            
    undermining my authority.   

03:17.000 --> 03:19.200
Now I want delivery men to deal 
      with me and me only.      

03:19.200 --> 03:20.200
         Is that clear?         

03:20.200 --> 03:22.200

in my place.

              your picture down.

03:34.900 --> 03:35.800

03:35.800 --> 03:37.000
You don't understand.           

03:37.100 --> 03:39.200
I mean, it's a tradition        
around here.                    

03:39.200 --> 03:40.600
It's always hung there.         

03:40.600 --> 03:43.200
    Mr. Malone, I'm afraid      
    things are different now.   

03:43.200 --> 03:45.000
                 This isn't your
                 bar anymore.

     Sure thing, Dr. Crane.     

04:06.700 --> 04:07.900
                Hey, by the way,

                  when you go to
                  the restroom, 

04:09.200 --> 04:10.500
                 I want you to  
                 notice that the

04:10.500 --> 04:13.100
              ( <i>speaks Chinese</i> )
              have been shined. 

04:15.900 --> 04:18.399
I'm hardly concerned            
about doorknobs at the moment.  

04:20.700 --> 04:22.000
              You understood me?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.100
    Yes. It was only            
    a matter of time.           

04:29.300 --> 04:30.900
Well, doesn't anybody care      
            to know             

04:30.900 --> 04:32.100
what I <i>am</i> concerned about?      

04:32.200 --> 04:33.500
                        No.     

04:33.500 --> 04:35.600
          Well, Fras,           
    you know normally,          

04:35.600 --> 04:37.100
I wouldn't give a rat's tokus   

04:37.200 --> 04:39.000
about anything                  
that happened to you,           

04:39.000 --> 04:41.600
but the last guy                
I waited on threw up on my leg. 

04:41.600 --> 04:43.600
Now, this couldn't be           
any worse, right?               

04:43.700 --> 04:45.200
        Shoot.                  

04:45.200 --> 04:46.700
              It's my love life.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.900
I'm gonna go find the guy       
that threw up on my leg.        

04:50.300 --> 04:51.600
      What's up, Frasier?       

04:51.600 --> 04:52.900
Well, Sam, this morning,        

04:52.900 --> 04:55.600
Lilith and I had                
the worst fight we've ever had. 

04:55.600 --> 04:57.400
And I'm almost ashamed          
to admit it, but I...           

04:57.400 --> 04:58.700
I even considered               
striking her.                   

04:58.800 --> 05:00.800
I mean, it wasn't completely    
without provocation.            

05:00.900 --> 05:02.100
She did throw a chair at me.    

05:02.100 --> 05:03.600
Just...                         

05:03.600 --> 05:06.200
it's the same argument we've had
all the time lately. It...      

05:06.300 --> 05:08.200
Only this time,                 
she-she issued an ultimatum.    

05:08.200 --> 05:10.000
She... she said                 
we ought to get married,        

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
or we're through.               

05:12.000 --> 05:14.500
Well, Frasier Crane does not    
cotton to emotional blackmail.  

05:14.500 --> 05:16.900
        Frasier, propose to her.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.300
            Get it over with.   

05:18.300 --> 05:19.900
            The truth is, she's 
            got her hook in you.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.100
Well, Sam, I'm not a fish.      

05:21.100 --> 05:22.300
I'm a man.                      

05:22.300 --> 05:23.500
There is a difference.          

05:23.600 --> 05:24.700
                    I know that.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.700
                 A fish would   
                 stand a chance.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.500
                    Trust me,   
                    propose.    

05:28.500 --> 05:30.400
    I couldn't, uh,             
    help but overhear           

05:30.400 --> 05:32.700
  what you were talking about   
          there, Fras.          

05:32.700 --> 05:33.900
Yeah.                           

05:33.900 --> 05:35.600
( <i>clears throat</i> ):              
We tried like hell,             

05:35.600 --> 05:36.900
but, uh, we heard it anyway.    

05:36.900 --> 05:39.600
         Well, it's not         
 that I don't care for Lilith.  

05:39.700 --> 05:42.600
    It-It's just that I fear    
     I-I tied myself to her     

05:42.700 --> 05:43.900
    because, well, you know,    

05:43.900 --> 05:45.900
    I haven't been all          
  that successful with women.   

05:45.900 --> 05:47.000
                Ah.             
                For some reason,

05:47.000 --> 05:48.900
              I don't think     
              they find me sexy.

                        Yes?    

11:29.400 --> 11:30.700
Hello, Rebecca.                 

11:32.900 --> 11:35.600
    Why do I suddenly feel      
    nervous as a schoolboy?     

11:35.600 --> 11:36.900
    Uh...                       

11:36.900 --> 11:38.900
    Well, let me-let me come    
     directly to the point      

11:39.000 --> 11:40.800
         by telling you         
 that you couldn't have chosen  

11:40.900 --> 11:43.200
    a more opportune moment     
to declare your feelings.       

11:43.300 --> 11:45.500
Let me assure you,              
the feeling is mutual.          

11:45.500 --> 11:46.700
     I've just recently...      

11:46.700 --> 11:48.400
 rid myself of an entanglement. 

11:48.500 --> 11:50.100
 I find myself free to ask you  

11:50.100 --> 11:52.200
         if you'd like          
     to join me for dinner.     

11:53.200 --> 11:54.900
                Who are you?    

11:56.000 --> 11:57.200
            My God.             

11:57.200 --> 11:58.600
    What have I done?           

12:00.800 --> 12:02.200
You leaving so soon, Dr. Crane? 

12:02.300 --> 12:03.900
      Yes, Woody, I've got      
  to convince the woman I love  

12:03.900 --> 12:05.000
  that I'm not a complete ass.  

12:05.000 --> 12:06.900
        Good luck!              

12:15.900 --> 12:17.900
         Oh, thank God.         

12:17.900 --> 12:20.600
LILITH:                         
What was that,                  
Tootsie Roll?                   

12:20.700 --> 12:23.200
I said, uh, thank God I'm home. 

12:23.200 --> 12:25.200
          I couldn't agree more.

12:31.100 --> 12:32.600
                How was your day
                at the office?  

12:32.600 --> 12:33.700
It was fine.                    

12:33.700 --> 12:35.600
How was yours?                  
                    Delightful. 

12:35.600 --> 12:36.600
Here,                           
I'll just make us               

12:36.700 --> 12:37.600
a couple of drinks,             

12:37.600 --> 12:39.200
and then                        
we can start relaxing.          

12:39.200 --> 12:40.200
        Where is the envelope   

12:40.300 --> 12:41.600
                 you left for me
                 on the table?  

12:41.700 --> 12:43.300
    Envelope? What envelope?    

12:43.300 --> 12:46.800
  Frasier. It's wicked of you   
          to tease me.          

12:46.900 --> 12:47.800
                    I saw it,   

12:47.800 --> 12:49.200
 but wanted to save it to open  

12:49.300 --> 12:50.400
      while you were here.      

12:50.400 --> 12:52.700
        It's probably either    
        tickets to the ballet   

12:52.700 --> 12:54.100
                or the symphony.

12:54.100 --> 12:56.300
 Or perhaps one of those cards  
     with a handsome couple     

12:56.300 --> 12:58.500
      walking hand in hand      
     on the beach at sunset     

12:58.500 --> 13:00.600
    that I cherish so.          

13:00.700 --> 13:03.700
You know,                       
that is exactly what it was.    

13:03.800 --> 13:04.800
( <i>chuckling</i> )                   

13:04.900 --> 13:06.900
Good Lord, I guess              
I'm becoming quite predictable. 

13:07.000 --> 13:08.300
You know,                       
I'll just have to think         

13:08.400 --> 13:09.600
of another way                  
to enchant you.                 

13:09.600 --> 13:10.800
I've got it.                    

13:12.500 --> 13:14.800
Look, it's a flock              
of seagulls.                    

13:14.900 --> 13:16.400
( <i>laughing</i> )                    

13:16.400 --> 13:18.600
Let's have our drink.           

13:18.600 --> 13:21.700
Here's to the most beautiful    
woman in the world.             

13:25.400 --> 13:27.400
Let me guess--                  
you read the letter.            

13:27.500 --> 13:31.300
    Yes, I read the letter,     
     you licentious quack!      

13:31.300 --> 13:33.500
                 And what facile
                 tripe it is!   

13:33.600 --> 13:35.400
                "We both need   
                time to grow,   

13:35.400 --> 13:37.100
          to develop as people."

13:37.100 --> 13:38.700
        Who is the slut?        

13:38.800 --> 13:39.900
         She's no slut!         

13:42.400 --> 13:43.800
        What slut?              

13:44.900 --> 13:46.800
         Well, I mean,          
  look, it was all a mistake.   

13:46.800 --> 13:47.900
    It's just a big mistake.    

13:48.000 --> 13:50.100
Oh, you bet it is, mister.      

13:50.100 --> 13:51.300
         You want your freedom?!

13:51.300 --> 13:53.500
  Ha, I'll give you freedom--   
        from your teeth!        

13:53.500 --> 13:55.000
No, Lilith!                     

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Not the Royal Doulton.          

13:58.800 --> 14:00.600
                You're right.   

14:00.700 --> 14:04.200
  I realize when I contemplate  
  the destruction of property   

14:04.300 --> 14:07.100
that I'm overstepping the bounds
          of decorum.           

14:07.100 --> 14:09.700
If there's any hope             
of our salvaging                

14:09.700 --> 14:11.300
    any of our relationship,    

14:11.300 --> 14:13.600
      we must remain calm       
        and discuss this        

14:13.700 --> 14:15.700
in a rational, truthful manner. 

14:15.700 --> 14:16.900
        All right.              

14:16.900 --> 14:18.800
    I'll be honest with you.    

14:18.800 --> 14:20.400
    There was a woman.          

14:20.500 --> 14:22.000
                But I am a      
                man of honor.   

14:22.000 --> 14:23.300
     I did not betray you.      

14:23.400 --> 14:24.700
    Nothing happened.           

14:24.700 --> 14:27.300
 You broke off our relationship 

14:27.300 --> 14:30.800
      for the possibility       
      of a relationship?        

14:30.800 --> 14:32.100
        A mere fantasy?         

14:32.200 --> 14:33.800
        How flattering.         

14:35.000 --> 14:37.400
        All right,              
    I'll be honest with you.    

14:38.800 --> 14:42.200
     You see, I only wanted     
         to spare you.          

14:42.200 --> 14:46.000
      This woman is a...        
      a sex-starved Circe       

14:46.000 --> 14:47.700
                who drew my ship
                onto the rocks  

14:47.700 --> 14:49.700
                    and there   
                    I foundered.

14:49.700 --> 14:51.100
What's her name?                

14:51.100 --> 14:53.800
     Well, let's just, you know,
     leave her name out of this.

14:53.800 --> 14:56.600
Frasier, are we going           
to clear the air                

14:56.700 --> 14:58.500
or continue                     
to hold back?                   

14:58.500 --> 14:59.600
Unless                          
you identify                    

14:59.600 --> 15:01.200
this woman,                     
doubt and suspicion             

15:01.300 --> 15:03.000
will fester                     
in my consciousness.            

15:03.000 --> 15:05.400
Every woman I meet              
will provoke the question,      

15:05.500 --> 15:07.300
"Is this the one,               
is this the one,                

15:07.300 --> 15:09.400
is this the one,                
is this the one                 
is this the one...?"            

15:09.400 --> 15:10.500
              It's Rebecca Howe.

15:10.500 --> 15:11.700
            She runs Cheers now.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.700
So, now we know the slut's name.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.800
    Please, Lilith...           

15:18.900 --> 15:22.000
             don't you think you
             could forgive me?  

15:22.100 --> 15:24.000
I don't know.                   

15:24.000 --> 15:26.800
  At this moment, my feelings   
    for you are ambivalent.     

15:26.800 --> 15:28.200
    I need to sort them out.    

15:29.300 --> 15:30.700
I'm going to go out             

15:30.800 --> 15:33.300
and wander the streets          
aimlessly.                      

15:33.400 --> 15:34.900
I'll take my usual route.       

15:38.100 --> 15:40.600
You know, I have                
an idea, Popsicle.              

15:40.600 --> 15:42.600
Uh, why don't I                 
run upstairs                    

15:42.700 --> 15:45.900
and make us a nice warm,        
soothing bath, hmm?             

15:46.000 --> 15:52.000
        Well, Mr. Bubble does   
        always cheer me so.     

15:52.100 --> 15:54.700
  Once begun, it's half done.   

16:06.400 --> 16:08.700
Are you sure                    
this is okay with Miss Howe?    

16:08.700 --> 16:10.800
             Woody, she loves   
             this kind of stuff.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.500
CARLA:                          
This is good,                   
wholesome humor.                

16:13.600 --> 16:16.200
            In fact,            
  I bet she gives you a raise   

16:16.200 --> 16:19.200
for doing such a good job.      

16:19.300 --> 16:20.800
                 Oh, don't stop.

16:20.900 --> 16:23.000
            I already saw it.   

16:23.100 --> 16:24.600
    And I must admit,           
I haven't laughed so hard       

16:24.600 --> 16:25.700
    since junior high.          

16:25.800 --> 16:28.600
    I helped.                   

16:34.100 --> 16:36.800
    Mr. Malone.                 

16:36.900 --> 16:38.300
             Yeah?              

16:38.300 --> 16:40.600
I want this nonsense            
with my picture to stop.        

16:40.700 --> 16:42.600
I did you a favor               
by hiring you back,             

16:42.600 --> 16:44.900
and this is not                 
a very nice way to repay me.    

16:44.900 --> 16:46.000
                You're right.   

16:46.000 --> 16:47.300
          You did do me a favor,

16:47.300 --> 16:48.600
            and now I'm going   
            to do you one.      

16:48.700 --> 16:49.900
I'm going                       
to give you a tip               

16:49.900 --> 16:52.000
on how to deal with people      
who work for you.               

16:52.100 --> 16:53.500
Lighten up a little bit.        

16:53.500 --> 16:56.000
I mean, you got to make         
some compromises.               

16:56.000 --> 16:57.200
                I see.          

16:57.200 --> 16:58.800
        You want me to hang     
        your picture back up.   

16:58.900 --> 17:00.100
        Right.                  
                Done.           

17:00.100 --> 17:02.000
        Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,   
        that was easy.          

17:02.000 --> 17:03.400
                     Wait, uh...

17:03.400 --> 17:05.200
             let's try some more
             compromises here.  

17:05.200 --> 17:07.500
                 Um... I want to

17:07.599 --> 17:09.800
                sleep with you  
                25 times, but...

17:09.900 --> 17:12.800
     you don't want to sleep    
     with me at all, am I right?

17:12.800 --> 17:13.900
    Right.                      

17:14.000 --> 17:15.700
     Okay, so what's half of 25?

17:15.700 --> 17:18.300
    Your I.Q.?                  

17:21.099 --> 17:23.000
             Wait, uh... please.

17:23.099 --> 17:25.700
      Um, I'm a little sensitive

17:25.800 --> 17:30.100
         about people making    
         fun of my intelligence.

17:30.200 --> 17:31.300
    I'm sorry.                  
            That's all right.   

17:31.400 --> 17:33.400
But I wasn't making fun         
of your intelligence.           

17:33.500 --> 17:34.800
                    Good.       

17:34.800 --> 17:36.700
I was making fun                
of your lack of intelligence.   

17:43.800 --> 17:46.800
              Cliffie, girl     
              fight, 12:00 high.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.400
         Rebecca Howe?          

17:49.500 --> 17:51.000
                Mm-hmm.         

17:51.000 --> 17:53.100
You and I                       
are both mature women,          

17:53.200 --> 17:55.400
and I think                     
we should handle this           

17:55.400 --> 17:57.100
openly and with civility.       

17:57.100 --> 18:00.100
Believe me, I could be doing you
a very big favor.               

18:00.200 --> 18:02.300
Frasier is not an easy man      
to live with.                   

18:02.400 --> 18:04.700
He's obsessively compulsive     
about neatness.                 

18:04.800 --> 18:06.400
The sex is good,                
but he pouts                    

18:06.500 --> 18:08.500
unless you compliment           
his performance.                

18:08.500 --> 18:10.000
Fortunately,                    

18:10.000 --> 18:11.900
his male ego                    
can be satisfied                

18:12.000 --> 18:14.200
with a simple                   
"Thank you, Conan."             

18:16.600 --> 18:19.200
    I don't know who you are,   

18:19.200 --> 18:22.500
                and I don't know
                who Frasier is, 

18:22.500 --> 18:24.400
              but I do... Conan?

18:24.500 --> 18:27.500
You really don't know Frasier,  
do you?                         

18:27.600 --> 18:28.900
                    No, I don't.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.700
God, I'm such a fool.           

18:30.800 --> 18:33.600
How could I let him             
do this to me?                  

18:33.700 --> 18:34.700
                 It's all right.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.500
        It happens to everybody.

18:36.500 --> 18:37.800
He made up this whole story     

18:37.800 --> 18:39.200
just to avoid                   
committing to me.               

18:39.200 --> 18:41.700
And the worst part is           
he's going to get away with it. 

18:41.700 --> 18:42.800
They always do.                 

18:42.800 --> 18:45.300
      Yeah, men are such a pain.

18:45.300 --> 18:47.500
            I have someone who's
            very special to me, 

18:47.500 --> 18:50.300
    but he wouldn't notice me   
    if I set fire to my hair.   

18:50.400 --> 18:52.800
        Him?                    

18:55.300 --> 18:56.500
                ( <i>scoffing</i> )    

18:56.600 --> 18:59.000
         No, definitely not him.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.600
              I prefer the      
              Fortune 500 type--

19:00.600 --> 19:02.100
            one who owns blocks,

19:02.100 --> 19:04.200
                not one who     
                plays with them.

19:06.900 --> 19:10.200
Look, they're flirting with me. 

19:10.200 --> 19:11.900
            Well, I really do   
            have work to do.    

19:11.900 --> 19:14.400
Perhaps we can have lunch       
together sometime.              

19:14.400 --> 19:15.700
                  I'd like that.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.200
    Lilith.                     
                Lilith.         

19:17.200 --> 19:19.500
            Well, good night.   
    Good night.                 

19:21.700 --> 19:24.900
          Mr. Malone,           
are you developing a tic?       

19:24.900 --> 19:26.500
                That was a wink.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.600
     Then you're developing     
          <i>into</i> a tick.          

19:32.500 --> 19:34.800
        And stop looking        
        at my rear end.         

19:34.800 --> 19:37.400
          Lucky guess.          

19:37.400 --> 19:39.300
    Lilith.                     

19:39.300 --> 19:41.000
Thank God                       
you're here.                    

19:41.000 --> 19:44.100
You haven't confronted          
Rebecca yet, have you?          

19:44.100 --> 19:45.500
                    Hardly.     
    Oh, good.                   

19:45.500 --> 19:47.300
 How did you know where I was?  

19:47.300 --> 19:49.600
     Well, when I realized      
you hadn't come upstairs,       

19:49.600 --> 19:51.100
  I-I toweled off, and then...  

19:52.300 --> 19:53.400
 ...suddenly, it dawned on me-- 

19:53.500 --> 19:55.500
    that little firebrand's     
      gone down to Cheers       

19:55.500 --> 19:56.500
     to fight for her man.      

19:56.600 --> 19:58.100
See, I think                    
it best                         

19:58.100 --> 19:59.800
     that I do this myself,     
        and, uh...              

19:59.800 --> 20:01.700
      I think next week's       
      a really good time.       

20:01.700 --> 20:04.000
              You did have an   
              affair with this  
              woman, didn't you?

20:04.000 --> 20:05.400
That is what you told me.       

20:05.400 --> 20:06.800
        Well, of course.        

20:06.900 --> 20:09.100
    Well, then end it           
      right here and now.       

20:09.100 --> 20:11.000
        I need to know          
        that it's over.         

20:11.100 --> 20:12.600
                You've got to   
                cut this off    

20:12.600 --> 20:15.000
        before she falls        
 more deeply in love with you.  

20:15.000 --> 20:18.700
                And you've got  
                to let me watch.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.300
 You know, I-I've got an idea.  

20:24.300 --> 20:25.500
Let's go to Maine.              

20:28.000 --> 20:29.500
Lilith...                       

20:29.500 --> 20:31.100
    Lilith, Lilith...           

20:31.200 --> 20:34.800
the left-hand side of my body's 
     gone completely numb.      

20:34.900 --> 20:37.400
You know what that means,       
        don't you?              

20:37.500 --> 20:40.700
        Yes, you're stalling.   

20:40.700 --> 20:42.700
    ( <i>knock at door</i> )           

20:42.700 --> 20:44.200
            It's down the       
            hall to the left.   

20:44.300 --> 20:45.400
        Thank you.              

20:45.400 --> 20:47.800
Ms. Howe,                       
let me introduce myself.        

20:47.800 --> 20:49.600
      I'm Lilith Sternin.       

20:49.600 --> 20:51.000
    You don't know me,          

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
but of course                   

20:52.000 --> 20:54.200
this man needs no introduction. 

20:54.200 --> 20:56.100
  He only needs a conscience.   

20:56.200 --> 20:57.400
                         Frasier

20:57.500 --> 20:59.300
         has something          
    he wants to say to you.     

20:59.300 --> 21:00.700
Listen                          
very carefully                  

21:00.800 --> 21:02.800
    and do what you must do.    

21:07.600 --> 21:08.900
I'm... I'm sorry, Rebecca,      

21:08.900 --> 21:10.900
    but it's-it's-it's time     
          it was over.          

21:11.000 --> 21:12.400
I hope you can forgive me.      

21:12.400 --> 21:13.700
     Now let's go to Maine.     

21:13.700 --> 21:15.700
Frasier, don't be               
so heartless.                   

21:15.700 --> 21:17.500
 She deserves better than that. 

21:20.500 --> 21:22.000
Uh, uh, no, no, please, please, 

21:22.100 --> 21:23.900
        don't try               
  to articulate your feelings.  

21:23.900 --> 21:25.600
Uh... just...                   

21:25.600 --> 21:27.000
  let me say my little piece,   

21:27.100 --> 21:29.400
     and then I'll be out       
     of your life forever.      

21:29.400 --> 21:32.500
  Now, just remember the part   
  about not saying anything.    

21:34.100 --> 21:35.800
                I know it sounds

21:35.800 --> 21:38.200
      like a cliché to...       

21:38.300 --> 21:40.700
        to say that this        
      is going to hurt me       

21:40.700 --> 21:42.300
    more than it does you...    

21:42.400 --> 21:45.000
     but it doesn't make it     
        any less true...        

21:45.100 --> 21:48.100
    for you see, it is I...     
     who will be condemned      

21:48.100 --> 21:50.900
never again to see your...      
         haunting eyes,         

21:50.900 --> 21:52.900
your silken skin,               

21:53.000 --> 21:55.200
     your shimmering hair.      

21:57.300 --> 22:00.200
 But it-it's time that we part. 

22:00.200 --> 22:02.000
    Farewell, sweet Rebecca.    

22:04.200 --> 22:07.000
        How will I live         
without your passionate kisses? 

22:07.000 --> 22:07.900
    You won't have to.          

22:07.900 --> 22:10.300
Oh, Frasier...                  

22:12.500 --> 22:14.200
Frasier,                        
for God's sakes,                

22:14.200 --> 22:15.800
she was only joking.            

22:15.800 --> 22:17.200
        Well, so was I.         

22:17.200 --> 22:19.300
                Come on.        

22:19.300 --> 22:20.600
I was just playing along.       

22:20.600 --> 22:22.100
        I'm a dead man.         

22:23.300 --> 22:25.400
Sweetheart? Buttercup?          

22:25.500 --> 22:27.800
     You were just kidding,     
          weren't you?          

22:28.800 --> 22:30.400
        My joy...!              

22:30.400 --> 22:31.700
         ( <i>door shuts</i> )         

22:31.700 --> 22:33.100
            Lilith.             

22:33.100 --> 22:34.400
                     Please, uh,

22:34.500 --> 22:36.300
             all I can say is...

22:36.300 --> 22:39.000
            please have         
            mercy on me. I...   

22:39.100 --> 22:40.900
             Look, it's the     
             God's honest truth.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
             Rebecca and I did  
             not have an affair.

22:43.100 --> 22:44.100
                    I wanted to,

22:44.200 --> 22:45.200
                  but she       
                  wasn't sure...

22:45.200 --> 22:46.300
         A small point,         

22:46.400 --> 22:48.400
    but she wasn't even sure    
        who I am, so...         

22:49.900 --> 22:51.800
    I didn't really want to.    

22:51.800 --> 22:53.600
     Uh, my body wanted to,     

22:53.700 --> 22:54.500
            but my brain didn't.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.000
            Well, part of my    
            brain did, but...   

22:56.100 --> 22:57.500
 Well, that part's dead, and... 

23:00.800 --> 23:05.000
        I guess...              
  what I'm trying to say is...  

23:11.700 --> 23:12.900
    Will you marry me,          

23:13.000 --> 23:15.200
make me the happiest man alive? 

23:15.200 --> 23:18.000
    This is obviously a ploy    
      to get yourself out       

23:18.100 --> 23:21.700
  of the ridiculous situation   
  you're in, and the answer...  

23:21.700 --> 23:25.400
     is yes, my steed, yes.     

23:27.600 --> 23:29.500
      Are you... you're serious?

23:29.500 --> 23:30.700
                    ( <i>laughing</i> )

23:30.800 --> 23:32.500
            Yippee.             

23:34.300 --> 23:35.300
                 Hey, everybody,

23:35.300 --> 23:36.800
we're going                     
to be married.                  

23:36.800 --> 23:38.100
          ( <i>cheering</i> )          

23:39.900 --> 23:42.200
                    Someday.    

23:42.200 --> 23:44.200
                    No, soon.   

23:45.300 --> 23:49.100
Eh, we finally got              
those lovebirds together, huh?  

23:49.100 --> 23:52.500
          Yeah, just needed that
          little push, I guess. 

23:52.600 --> 23:54.400
    ( <i>both singing</i> ):           
¶ Matchmaker, matchmaker        

23:54.500 --> 23:55.900
     ¶ Make me a match...       

23:56.305 --> 24:02.804
