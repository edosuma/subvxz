<i>Officer, what's the matter?</i>
<i>What's the problem?</i>

22:23.416 --> 22:24.916
<i>When I walked up</i>
<i>on the incident, this lady--</i>

22:25.000 --> 22:27.833
<i>-Sylvester wrecked Ma's car.</i>
<i>-I… I did not. The man hit me.</i>

<i>[policeman] You want it in a nutshell?</i>

22:29.500 --> 22:30.833
<i>We got her charged</i>
<i>with assault and battery.</i>

22:30.916 --> 22:33.083
<i>-Assault and what for what?</i>
<i>-Sylvester was driving--</i>

22:33.166 --> 22:34.833
<i>I can tell you what happened</i>
<i>if you wanna know.</i>

22:34.916 --> 22:37.375
<i>That's my nephew.</i>
<i>That's Sylvester. He was driving my car--</i>

22:37.458 --> 22:39.625
<i>-We don't know whose car it is.</i>
<i>-That's Ma's car.</i>

22:39.708 --> 22:41.041
<i>I bought and paid for that car.</i>

22:41.125 --> 22:42.833
<i>That's what you say.</i>
<i>We gotta check it out.</i>

22:42.916 --> 22:44.125
<i>What's the problem?</i>

22:44.208 --> 22:45.125
<i>I was calling the paddy wagon</i>

22:45.208 --> 22:47.666
<i>to haul them</i>
<i>to the station, sort everything out.</i>

22:47.750 --> 22:49.833
<i>-She's aggressive with the other driver--</i>
<i>-He got ugly with me.</i>

22:49.916 --> 22:52.125
<i>-I don't know why you tell that lie.</i>
<i>-You let me tell the story?</i>

22:52.208 --> 22:54.333
<i>Well, if you gonna tell it, tell it right.</i>

23:00.750 --> 23:04.041
<i>Like I said,</i>
<i>while I was waiting for the paddy wagon,</i>

23:04.125 --> 23:05.791
<i>I turn to hear</i>
<i>this guy's side of the story.</i>

23:05.875 --> 23:07.458
<i>She won't let him get a word in edgeways.</i>

23:07.541 --> 23:10.208
<i>He steps in front of her</i>
<i>to tell his version of things,</i>

23:10.291 --> 23:11.125
<i>she pushes him to the ground.</i>

23:11.208 --> 23:12.583
<i>She ain't hit him. He just fell.</i>

23:12.666 --> 23:14.541
<i>If that don't beat all to hell.</i>
<i>I ain't touched the man.</i>

23:14.625 --> 23:17.250
<i>All right, Ma. Officer,</i>
<i>can I speak to you for a minute?</i>

23:17.333 --> 23:18.333
<i>I got things to do.</i>

23:18.416 --> 23:20.291
<i>He bumped into me and fell down.</i>

23:20.375 --> 23:22.333
<i>Flopping on the ground like a rag doll.</i>

23:23.541 --> 23:24.958
<i>I ain't touch the man.</i>

<i>I got it all taken care of.</i>

<i>Clear it out. Come on. Let's go.</i>

23:38.833 --> 23:40.208
<i>What's going on? What did you do?</i>

23:40.291 --> 23:41.166
<i>Sturdyvant, get on away from me.</i>

23:41.250 --> 23:43.291
<i>That's the last thing I need,</i>
<i>to go through your shit.</i>

23:43.375 --> 23:45.666
<i>-[policeman] Everybody move along.</i>
<i>-It's not the place.</i>

23:45.750 --> 23:47.000
<i>Here, Ma.</i>

<i>They're in the band room.</i>

23:58.208 --> 24:01.375
<i>-Ma, why don't you sit and relax?</i>
<i>-I ain't for no sitting.</i>

24:01.458 --> 24:03.916

<i>I talked to her last night.</i>
<i>Got everything straight.</i>

24:33.833 --> 24:35.958
<i>You stay out of the way. Let me handle it.</i>

24:36.041 --> 24:37.833
<i>You handled it last time, remember?</i>

24:37.916 --> 24:41.500
<i>She marches in like she owns the place,</i>
<i>complains about the building being cold,</i>

<i>I'm gonna take you tomorrow</i>
<i>to get you some things</i>

25:17.916 --> 25:19.666

27:36.083 --> 27:38.250
<i>They'll send it over</i>
<i>with one of their fellows.</i>

27:38.333 --> 27:39.708
<i>Better have my car fixed right.</i>

27:39.791 --> 27:43.166
<i>I ain't going for that. Brand-new car.</i>

<i>I know they ain't rehearsing</i>
<i>Levee's "Black Bottom."</i>

27:56.791 --> 27:58.166
<i>I know I ain't hearing that.</i>

27:58.250 --> 28:00.208
<i>Ma, it's what I wanted</i>
<i>to talk to you about.</i>

28:00.291 --> 28:02.500
<i>Levee's version, it really picks it up.</i>

28:02.583 --> 28:06.208
<i>I ain't studying Levee nothing.</i>
<i>I know what he done to that song.</i>

28:06.291 --> 28:08.833
<i>I don't like to sing it that way.</i>
<i>I'm doing it the old way.</i>

28:08.916 --> 28:11.416
<i>That's why I brought my nephew</i>
<i>in here to do the voice intro.</i>

28:11.500 --> 28:15.000
<i>That's what people want now, Ma.</i>
<i>They want something they can dance to.</i>

28:15.083 --> 28:17.208
<i>Levee's arrangement</i>
<i>gives the people what they want.</i>

28:17.291 --> 28:20.000
<i>It makes them excited,</i>
<i>forget about their troubles.</i>

28:20.083 --> 28:24.166
<i>I don't care what you say, honey.</i>
<i>Levee ain't messing up my song.</i>

28:24.250 --> 28:26.916
<i>If he got what the people want,</i>
<i>let him take it somewhere else.</i>

28:27.000 --> 28:29.416
<i>I'm singing Ma Rainey's song,</i>
<i>not Levee's song.</i>

28:29.500 --> 28:31.083
<i>Now that's all there is to it.</i>

28:31.666 --> 28:34.750
<i>Carry my nephew on down there.</i>
<i>Introduce him to the band.</i>

28:34.833 --> 28:36.958
<i>I promised my sister I'd look out for him,</i>

<i>the voice intro to the song my way.</i>

28:40.375 --> 28:41.458

<i>Who's this "we"? What you mean "we"?</i>
<i>Come talking this "we" stuff. Who "we"?</i>

28:46.125 --> 28:47.708
<i>Me and Sturdyvant. We decided--</i>

<i>You decided, huh?</i>
<i>I'm just a bump on a log.</i>

28:50.333 --> 28:52.125
<i>I'm just gonna go</i>
<i>whichever way the river drift.</i>

28:52.208 --> 28:54.000
<i>Is that it? You and Sturdyvant decided?</i>

28:54.083 --> 28:56.125
<i>-No. We just thought--</i>
<i>-I ain't got no good sense.</i>

28:56.208 --> 28:59.541
<i>I know nothing about music</i>
<i>or what a good song is or what ain't.</i>

<i>You know more about my fans than I do.</i>

29:01.291 --> 29:03.833
<i>It's not that.</i>
<i>It's more of what the people want.</i>

29:05.291 --> 29:09.458
<i>Tell you something, Irvin, and you can go</i>
<i>up there and you can tell Sturdyvant too.</i>

29:10.083 --> 29:13.375
<i>What you all say</i>
<i>don't count with me, you understand?</i>

29:13.458 --> 29:16.375
<i>Ma listen to her heart.</i>
<i>Ma listen to the voice inside her.</i>

29:16.458 --> 29:17.833

29:18.625 --> 29:20.250
<i>Carry my nephew on down there.</i>

29:20.333 --> 29:23.500
<i>Tell Cutler he'll do the voice intro</i>
<i>to the "Black Bottom" song.</i>

29:23.583 --> 29:25.166
<i>Levee ain't messing up my song.</i>

<i>If that don't set right</i>
<i>with you and Sturdyvant,</i>

29:27.083 --> 29:29.583
<i>I can carry my black bottom</i>
<i>on back down South to my tour,</i>

29:29.666 --> 29:31.625
<i>'cause I don't like it up here noways.</i>

29:32.291 --> 29:34.125
<i>Okay, Ma.</i>

29:35.125 --> 29:36.083
<i>I don't care.</i>

<i>-I just thought--</i>
<i>-Damn what you thought!</i>

<i>trying to tell me how to sing my song.</i>

29:43.208 --> 29:45.833
<i>That Levee and Sturdyvant shit,</i>
<i>I ain't going for it.</i>

<i>What? Mr. Irvin said</i>
<i>we're using my version.</i>

30:40.000 --> 30:41.541
<i>I ain't studying you or Mr. Irvin.</i>

35:46.125 --> 35:47.708
<i>I was eight years old</i>

35:48.291 --> 35:50.708
<i>when a gang of white mans</i>
<i>come into my daddy's house</i>

35:50.791 --> 35:53.208
<i>and have to do with my mama</i>
<i>any way they want.</i>

35:54.708 --> 35:59.291
<i>We was living in Jefferson County,</i>

35:59.375 --> 36:02.666
<i>My daddy's name was Memphis.</i>
<i>Memphis Lee Green.</i>

36:02.750 --> 36:07.041
<i>Had him near 50 acres of good</i>
<i>farming land. I'm talking good land.</i>

36:07.125 --> 36:08.708
<i>Grow anything you want.</i>

36:09.500 --> 36:11.500
<i>He done gone off of shares</i>
<i>and bought this land</i>

36:11.583 --> 36:14.125
<i>from Mr. Hallie's widow woman</i>
<i>after he done passed on.</i>

36:14.208 --> 36:17.166
<i>Folks called him a uppity nigger</i>
<i>'cause he done saved and borrowed</i>

36:17.250 --> 36:19.875
<i>to where he could</i>
<i>buy this land and be independent.</i>

36:21.125 --> 36:22.833
<i>It was coming on planting time,</i>

36:23.500 --> 36:26.916
<i>and my daddy went into Natchez</i>
<i>to get him some seed and fertilizer.</i>

36:27.000 --> 36:31.500
<i>Called me, say, "Levee,</i>
<i>you the man of the house now."</i>

36:33.333 --> 36:35.458
<i>"Take care of your mama while I'm gone."</i>

36:38.416 --> 36:39.958
<i>I wasn't but a little boy.</i>

36:41.541 --> 36:42.875
<i>Eight years old.</i>

36:46.000 --> 36:47.083
<i>My mama…</i>

36:48.291 --> 36:51.416
<i>was frying up some chicken</i>
<i>when them mans come in the house.</i>

36:52.333 --> 36:54.125
<i>Must have been eight or nine of 'em.</i>

36:55.458 --> 36:59.875
<i>She's standing there frying that chicken</i>
<i>when them mans come and took a hold of her</i>

36:59.958 --> 37:04.541
<i>just like you take hold of a mule</i>
<i>and make it do what you want.</i>

37:08.541 --> 37:10.041
<i>There was my mama…</i>

37:11.500 --> 37:13.208
<i>with a gang of white mans.</i>

37:17.750 --> 37:19.666
<i>She tried to fight 'em off.</i>

37:21.000 --> 37:23.750
<i>I could see where </i>
<i>it wasn't gonna do her any good.</i>

37:25.041 --> 37:27.125
<i>I didn't know what they was doing to her,</i>

37:27.208 --> 37:30.541
<i>but I figured whatever it was,</i>
<i>they might as well do to me too.</i>

37:32.666 --> 37:36.625
<i>My daddy had a knife he kept around there</i>
<i>for hunting and working and whatnot.</i>

37:36.708 --> 37:39.708
<i>And I knew where he kept it.</i>
<i>I went and got it.</i>

37:42.125 --> 37:47.125
<i>I'm gonna show you</i>
<i>how spooked up I was by the white man.</i>

37:49.000 --> 37:51.875
<i>I tried my damnedest</i>
<i>to cut one of them's throat.</i>

37:53.208 --> 37:54.750
<i>I hit him on the shoulder.</i>

37:55.875 --> 37:57.541
<i>He reached back,</i>
<i>grabbed hold of that knife,</i>

37:57.625 --> 38:00.041
<i>and whacked me across the chest with it.</i>

38:03.916 --> 38:05.000
<i>[sniffles]</i>

38:05.833 --> 38:07.416
<i>That's what made them stop.</i>

38:08.833 --> 38:11.041
<i>They was scared</i>
<i>I was gonna bleed to death.</i>

38:13.000 --> 38:14.791
<i>My mama wrapped me in a blanket,</i>

38:14.875 --> 38:18.000
<i>carried me two miles</i>
<i>down to the Furlow place</i>

38:18.083 --> 38:20.333
<i>and they drove me up to Doc Albans.</i>

38:20.416 --> 38:23.958
<i>He was waiting on a calf to be born,</i>
<i>and he say he ain't had time to see me.</i>

38:25.125 --> 38:27.375
<i>They carried me to Miss Etta, the midwife,</i>

38:28.541 --> 38:30.000
<i>and she fixed me up.</i>

38:32.333 --> 38:33.791
<i>My daddy came back</i>

38:34.791 --> 38:37.708
<i>and acted like he done accepted</i>
<i>the facts of what happened.</i>

38:38.208 --> 38:40.583
<i>He got the names</i>
<i>of them mans from Mama.</i>

38:41.708 --> 38:43.000
<i>He found out who they was,</i>

38:43.083 --> 38:45.333
<i>and then we announced</i>
<i>we was moving out that county.</i>

38:45.416 --> 38:47.916
<i>We said goodbye to everybody,</i>
<i>all the neighbors.</i>

38:48.000 --> 38:50.291
<i>[breathes deeply]</i>

38:50.375 --> 38:53.375
<i>My daddy went and smiled</i>

38:57.125 --> 38:58.708
<i>Smiled in his face…</i>

<i>We moved over with relations in Caldwell.</i>

39:07.208 --> 39:09.000
<i>He got us settled in,</i>

<i>and then he took off one day.</i>
<i>I ain't never seen him since.</i>

39:16.500 --> 39:17.958
<i>[chuckles sadly]</i>

39:18.041 --> 39:19.375
<i>He sneaked back.</i>

39:21.125 --> 39:22.666
<i>Hiding up in the woods,</i>

39:23.541 --> 39:26.083
<i>laying to get them eight or nine men.</i>

39:29.083 --> 39:31.500

<i>[chuckles]</i>

39:38.083 --> 39:39.583
<i>[inhales deeply]</i>

39:39.666 --> 39:41.625
<i>They tracked him down in the woods.</i>

39:44.166 --> 39:45.625
<i>Caught up with him, hung him…</i>

39:47.166 --> 39:48.333
<i>set him afire.</i>

39:53.208 --> 39:56.875
<i>My daddy wasn't spooked up</i>
<i>by the white man. No, sir.</i>

39:57.958 --> 40:00.208
<i>And that taught me how to handle them.</i>

40:01.291 --> 40:05.791
<i>I seen my daddy go up</i>
<i>and grin in this cracker's face.</i>

40:05.875 --> 40:08.291
<i>[laughs scornfully]</i>

40:08.375 --> 40:11.541
<i>Smile in his face and sell him his land.</i>

40:11.625 --> 40:15.208
<i>All the while,</i>

40:19.333 --> 40:21.208
<i>That taught me how to handle them.</i>

40:23.166 --> 40:27.000
<i>So you all just back up</i>
<i>and leave Levee alone about the white man.</i>

40:27.833 --> 40:31.416

1:03:08.500 --> 1:03:09.625
<i>Hmm.</i>

1:03:09.708 --> 1:03:14.416

<i>up there at the church.</i>

1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:21.958
<i>So, yeah…</i>

1:03:22.833 --> 1:03:25.041
<i>Toledo been a fool about a woman.</i>

1:03:26.416 --> 1:03:27.791
<i>That's part of making life.</i>

1:03:28.958 --> 1:03:31.041
<i>Toledo, what you call a fool</i>

1:03:31.125 --> 1:03:33.416
<i>and what I call a fool</i>
<i>are two different things.</i>

1:03:33.500 --> 1:03:37.666
<i>A fool is responsible</i>
<i>for what happen to him.</i>

1:03:37.750 --> 1:03:40.291
<i>A fool cause it to happen. Like Levee.</i>

1:03:40.791 --> 1:03:44.583
<i>He keep messing around with Ma's gal,</i>
<i>his feet be out there scraping the ground.</i>

1:03:44.666 --> 1:03:46.750
<i>-That's a fool.</i>
<i>-Nothing gonna happen to Levee.</i>

1:03:46.833 --> 1:03:48.416
<i>Levee ain't gonna let</i>
<i>nothing happen to him.</i>

1:03:48.500 --> 1:03:51.375
<i>Better not let Ma see you ask her.</i>
<i>That's what the man's trying to tell you.</i>

1:03:51.458 --> 1:03:53.208
<i>I don't need nobody to tell me nothing.</i>

1:03:53.291 --> 1:03:55.958
<i>Toledo, all I'm saying is,</i>
<i>from the looks of it,</i>

1:03:56.041 --> 1:03:58.375
<i>from your story,</i>
<i>I don't think life treated you fair.</i>

1:03:58.458 --> 1:03:59.750
<i>Oh, life's fair.</i>

1:03:59.833 --> 1:04:00.958
<i>Life ain't shit.</i>

1:04:01.041 --> 1:04:03.208
<i>You can put it in a paper bag</i>
<i>and carry it around with you.</i>

1:04:03.291 --> 1:04:05.500
<i>-It ain't got no balls.</i>
<i>-[door clangs]</i>

1:04:05.583 --> 1:04:08.333
<i>Now death? Death got some style.</i>

1:04:08.416 --> 1:04:11.000
<i>Death will kick your ass</i>
<i>and make you wish you never been born.</i>

1:04:11.083 --> 1:04:12.500
<i>That's how bad death is.</i>

1:04:12.583 --> 1:04:14.791
<i>But you can rule over life.</i>
<i>Life ain't nothing.</i>

1:04:14.875 --> 1:04:17.625
<i>Nigga talking about life is fair</i>
<i>and ain't got a pot to piss in.</i>

1:04:17.708 --> 1:04:19.708
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Now I'm gonna tell you something.</i>

1:04:19.791 --> 1:04:22.166
<i>A nigga gonna be dissatisfied</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

1:04:22.250 --> 1:04:24.250
<i>Niggas got a right to be dissatisfied.</i>

1:04:24.333 --> 1:04:27.291
<i>Is you gonna be satisfied</i>
<i>with a bone somebody done throwed you</i>

1:04:27.375 --> 1:04:29.458
<i>when you done</i>
<i>seen them eating a whole hog?</i>

<i>You lucky they let you be an entertainer.</i>
<i>You're lucky and don't even know it.</i>

1:04:32.708 --> 1:04:36.458
<i>I'm talking about being satisfied</i>
<i>with a bone somebody done throwed you.</i>

1:04:36.541 --> 1:04:40.125
<i>That's what's the matter with y'all,</i>
<i>you're satisfied sitting in one place.</i>

1:04:40.208 --> 1:04:41.750
<i>Soon as I get my band together</i>

1:04:41.833 --> 1:04:44.333
<i>and record them songs</i>
<i>Mr. Sturdyvant done told me I can make,</i>

1:04:44.416 --> 1:04:47.500
<i>I'm gonna be like Ma and tell</i>
<i>the white man just what he can do.</i>

1:04:48.083 --> 1:04:49.625
<i>Ma tell Mr. Irvin she leaving?</i>

1:04:49.708 --> 1:04:53.125
<i>Mr. Irvin get down on his knees</i>
<i>and beg her to stay.</i>

1:04:53.208 --> 1:04:56.333
<i>That's the way I'm gonna be.</i>
<i>Make the white man respect me.</i>

1:04:56.416 --> 1:04:58.375
<i>The white man don't care nothing about Ma.</i>

1:04:58.458 --> 1:05:00.625
<i>The colored folks made Ma a star.</i>

1:05:00.708 --> 1:05:03.375
<i>The white folks don't care</i>
<i>nothing about who she is</i>

1:05:03.458 --> 1:05:04.958
<i>or what kind of music she make.</i>

1:05:05.041 --> 1:05:07.916
<i>Let her go to one of them</i>
<i>white folks hotel and see how big she is.</i>

1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:10.666
<i>[scoffs] Hell, she can't even</i>
<i>get a cab up here in the North.</i>

1:05:10.750 --> 1:05:13.083
<i>I'mma tell you something. Reverend Gates.</i>

1:05:13.166 --> 1:05:15.500
<i>Slow Drag, you know</i>
<i>who I'm talking about. Reverend Gates.</i>

1:05:15.583 --> 1:05:19.333
<i>Reverend Gates was, uh, coming up</i>
<i>from Tallahassee to Atlanta</i>

1:05:19.416 --> 1:05:22.875
<i>to see his sister who was sick</i>
<i>at that time with the consumption.</i>

1:05:23.708 --> 1:05:26.583
<i>The train come up</i>
<i>through Thomasville, then past Moultrie,</i>

1:05:26.666 --> 1:05:29.083
<i>and then ended up</i>
<i>in this little town called Sigsbee.</i>

1:05:29.166 --> 1:05:31.166
<i>You can stop telling that right there.</i>

1:05:31.250 --> 1:05:35.166
<i>Ain't but one train come out</i>
<i>of Tallahassee headed north to Atlanta.</i>

1:05:35.250 --> 1:05:36.458
<i>It don't stop at Sigsbee.</i>

1:05:36.541 --> 1:05:38.875
<i>The only train</i>
<i>that stop at Sigsbee is the Santa Fe,</i>

1:05:38.958 --> 1:05:40.541
<i>and you gotta transfer</i>
<i>at Moultrie to get it.</i>

1:05:40.625 --> 1:05:42.291
<i>Maybe that's what he done. I don't know.</i>

1:05:42.375 --> 1:05:44.458
<i>I'm just telling you</i>
<i>he got off at Sigsbee.</i>

1:05:44.541 --> 1:05:47.208
<i>You telling it.</i>
<i>Tell it your way. Just make up anything.</i>

1:05:47.291 --> 1:05:49.125
<i>Leave him alone and let him finish.</i>

1:05:49.208 --> 1:05:50.708
<i>Go on, tell it your way.</i>

1:05:50.791 --> 1:05:54.000
<i>Reverend Gates</i>
<i>got off this train in Sigsbee.</i>

1:05:54.083 --> 1:05:55.458
<i>Figured he'd check the schedule</i>

1:05:55.541 --> 1:05:59.333
<i>to make sure he arrived in time</i>
<i>for somebody to pick him up. All right?</i>

1:05:59.416 --> 1:06:03.791
<i>While he's there, it come upon him</i>
<i>that he had to go to the bathroom.</i>

1:06:03.875 --> 1:06:05.875
<i>Now, the only colored restroom they had</i>

1:06:05.958 --> 1:06:09.791
<i>was an outhouse they had sitting way back,</i>
<i>200 yards or so from the train station.</i>

1:06:10.541 --> 1:06:13.916
<i>While he's in the outhouse,</i>
<i>the train go off and leave without him.</i>

1:06:14.541 --> 1:06:17.833
<i>Now, he don't know</i>
<i>where he is in this town.</i>

1:06:17.916 --> 1:06:19.875
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>he ain't never heard of it before.</i>

1:06:19.958 --> 1:06:22.083
<i>I heard of it,</i>
<i>and he ain't got off no train</i>

1:06:22.166 --> 1:06:24.208
<i>coming outta Tallahassee in Sigsbee.</i>

1:06:24.791 --> 1:06:28.125
<i>The man's standing there</i>
<i>trying to figure out what he gonna do,</i>

1:06:28.208 --> 1:06:30.500
<i>where this train</i>
<i>done left him in this strange town.</i>

1:06:32.416 --> 1:06:33.625
<i>It started getting dark.</i>

1:06:34.333 --> 1:06:36.708
<i>He sees</i>
<i>where the sun's getting low in the sky,</i>

1:06:36.791 --> 1:06:39.166
<i>and he's trying</i>
<i>to figure out what he gonna do,</i>

1:06:39.250 --> 1:06:40.750
<i>when he noticed a couple of white fellas</i>

1:06:40.833 --> 1:06:42.875
<i>standing across the street</i>
<i>from the station.</i>

1:06:42.958 --> 1:06:44.875
<i>Just standing there, watching him.</i>

1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:48.750
<i>Then two or three more fellas</i>
<i>come up and join the other one.</i>

1:06:49.250 --> 1:06:53.250
<i>Now he look around the station.</i>
<i>He don't see no colored folks nowhere.</i>

1:06:53.750 --> 1:06:55.583
<i>He don't know</i>
<i>what's getting into these fellas' minds,</i>

1:06:55.666 --> 1:06:57.791
<i>so he commence to walking.</i>

1:06:57.875 --> 1:07:01.000
<i>He don't know where he walking.</i>
<i>He walking down the railroad tracks</i>

1:07:01.083 --> 1:07:03.416
<i>when he hear, "Hey, nigger."</i>

1:07:04.833 --> 1:07:06.250
<i>Just like that.</i>

1:07:07.041 --> 1:07:08.458
<i>"Hey, nigger."</i>

1:07:10.041 --> 1:07:11.208
<i>He keep walking.</i>

1:07:12.083 --> 1:07:15.125
<i>They call him some more. He kept walking.</i>

1:07:16.291 --> 1:07:19.833
<i>Then he heard a gunshot.</i>
<i>Yeah. He stopped then, you know.</i>

1:07:20.708 --> 1:07:21.916
<i>They crowded around him.</i>

1:07:22.666 --> 1:07:23.791
<i>He's standing there,</i>

1:07:24.583 --> 1:07:26.166
<i>cross around his neck,</i>

1:07:26.250 --> 1:07:29.291
<i>and the little Bible</i>
<i>that he keep with him all the time.</i>

1:07:30.458 --> 1:07:34.083
<i>They ask who he was.</i>
<i>He said he was Reverend Gates</i>

1:07:34.166 --> 1:07:35.666
<i>and he was on his way to see his sister</i>

1:07:35.750 --> 1:07:37.958
<i>who was sick,</i>
<i>and the train went off and left him.</i>

1:07:38.041 --> 1:07:40.916
<i>And they said, "Yeah, nigger?"</i>

1:07:41.500 --> 1:07:43.166
<i>"But can you dance?"</i>

1:07:47.125 --> 1:07:48.416
<i>He looked at them</i>

1:07:49.125 --> 1:07:50.583
<i>and commenced to dancing.</i>

1:07:53.333 --> 1:07:56.416
<i>One of them reached up</i>
<i>and tore his cross off his neck,</i>

1:07:56.500 --> 1:08:00.000
<i>said he was committing heresy</i>
<i>by dancing with a cross and a Bible.</i>

1:08:02.375 --> 1:08:04.958
<i>Took his Bible and tore it up,</i>

1:08:05.041 --> 1:08:07.833
<i>and had him dancing</i>
<i>till they got tired of watching him.</i>

1:08:09.125 --> 1:08:13.708
<i>-That's the only way that man--</i>
<i>-What I wants to know is, he a man of God.</i>

1:08:13.791 --> 1:08:16.416
<i>Where the hell was God</i>
<i>when all this was going on?</i>

1:08:17.458 --> 1:08:19.458
<i>Why didn't God strike down them crackers</i>

1:08:19.541 --> 1:08:21.666
<i>with some of this lightning</i>
<i>you talking about to me?</i>

1:08:22.166 --> 1:08:23.958
<i>Levee, you gonna burn in hell.</i>

<i>Why didn't God strike</i>
<i>some of them crackers down? Tell me that.</i>

<i>I'll tell you why.</i>
<i>I'll tell you the truth.</i>

1:08:39.541 --> 1:08:41.875
<i>God ain't never listened</i>
<i>to no nigga's prayers.</i>

1:08:41.958 --> 1:08:44.250
<i>God take the nigga's prayers</i>
<i>and throw them in the garbage.</i>

1:08:44.333 --> 1:08:48.666
<i>God don't pay niggas no mind.</i>
<i>In fact, God hate niggas.</i>

1:08:49.291 --> 1:08:51.583
<i>Hate them with all the fury in his heart.</i>

1:15:46.541 --> 1:15:48.666
<i>You go on up there,</i>
<i>and you tell Sturdyvant</i>

1:15:48.750 --> 1:15:50.708

1:17:07.250 --> 1:17:08.541
<i>The only mistake…</i>

1:17:09.541 --> 1:17:12.375
<i>was when you found out</i>

<i>Man give me a check last time.</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

<i>See a nigga with a check,</i>
<i>first thing they think is he stole it.</i>

<i>[Levee] Uh, Mr. Sturdyvant, sir?</i>

<i>About them songs I give you?</i>

1:19:41.041 --> 1:19:43.500
<i>Oh, yeah. Oh, Levee.</i>
<i>Uh, I thought about it.</i>

1:19:43.583 --> 1:19:45.583
<i>I don't think that people will buy them.</i>

1:19:45.666 --> 1:19:47.541
<i>They're not the type of songs</i>
<i>we're looking for.</i>

1:19:47.625 --> 1:19:50.666
<i>Mr. Sturdyvant, sir.</i>
<i>I done already got my band picked out.</i>

1:19:50.750 --> 1:19:54.291
<i>I got some real good fellas.</i>
<i>They know how to play real good music.</i>

1:19:54.375 --> 1:19:57.083
<i>I know if the peoples</i>
<i>hear the music, they'll buy it.</i>

1:19:57.166 --> 1:20:00.250
<i>Uh, Levee, I'll be fair with you.</i>
<i>They're not the right songs.</i>

1:20:00.333 --> 1:20:03.250
<i>Mr. Sturdyvant, peoples</i>
<i>is tired of hearing jug-band music.</i>

1:20:03.333 --> 1:20:06.291
<i>The people in the big city?</i>
<i>They want something with some fire to it.</i>

1:20:06.375 --> 1:20:08.458
<i>Harlem, Detroit, DC.</i>

1:20:08.541 --> 1:20:11.666
<i>Okay, I'll tell you what.</i>
<i>I'll give you $5 apiece for 'em.</i>

1:20:11.750 --> 1:20:16.583
<i>I don't want $5, Mr. Sturdyvant.</i>
<i>I wants to record them songs like you say.</i>

1:20:16.666 --> 1:20:18.750
<i>Like I say, they're not</i>
<i>the kind of songs we're looking for.</i>

1:20:18.833 --> 1:20:21.250
<i>Mr. Sturdyvant,</i>
<i>you asked me to write them songs.</i>

1:20:21.333 --> 1:20:23.791
<i>Why didn't you tell me that</i>
<i>when I first give them to you?</i>

1:20:23.875 --> 1:20:25.791
<i>You told me you was</i>
<i>gonna let me record them.</i>

1:20:25.875 --> 1:20:27.291
<i>What's the difference</i>
<i>between then and now?</i>

1:20:27.375 --> 1:20:30.166
<i>-I'll pay you for your trouble.</i>
<i>-What's the difference?</i>

1:20:30.250 --> 1:20:31.583
<i>That's what I wanna know.</i>

1:20:32.166 --> 1:20:34.041
<i>I had my fellas play your songs.</i>

1:20:34.125 --> 1:20:37.500
<i>When I heard them, they didn't sound</i>
<i>like the kind I'm looking for right now.</i>

1:20:37.583 --> 1:20:39.541
<i>You got to hear me play them.</i>

1:20:39.625 --> 1:20:42.666
<i>You ain't heard me play them.</i>
<i>That's what's gonna make them sound right.</i>

1:20:42.750 --> 1:20:44.083
<i>Levee, I don't doubt that.</i>

1:20:44.166 --> 1:20:47.125
<i>It's just that, I don't think</i>
<i>they'd sell like Ma's records.</i>

1:20:48.458 --> 1:20:50.208
<i>But I'll take 'em off your hands for you.</i>

1:20:51.916 --> 1:20:54.166
<i>[chuckles] Mr. Sturdyvant, sir.</i>

1:20:55.041 --> 1:20:58.500
<i>I don't know what fellas</i>
<i>you had playing them songs,</i>

1:20:58.583 --> 1:21:02.583
<i>but if I could play them,</i>
<i>I'd set them down in the people's lap.</i>

1:21:02.666 --> 1:21:05.416
<i>Now, you told me</i>
<i>I could record them songs.</i>

1:21:05.500 --> 1:21:06.958
<i>There's nothing I can do about that.</i>

1:21:07.041 --> 1:21:10.666
<i>Like I say, it's $5 apiece.</i>
<i>That's what I'll pay ya.</i>

1:21:10.750 --> 1:21:12.041
<i>I'm doing you a favor.</i>

1:21:12.125 --> 1:21:15.541
<i>If you write any more, I'll help</i>
<i>you out and take 'em off your hands.</i>

1:21:15.625 --> 1:21:18.750
<i>The price is $5 apiece. Just like now.</i>
