01:34.527 --> 01:37.360
- That's good.
- How's Bullock doing? 

01:37.807 --> 01:40.924
I don't discuss my patients,
one with another.

01:41.087 --> 01:42.156
Bleeding through his fucking ear?

01:42.247 --> 01:43.919
He was bleeding through it
pretty fucking good...

01:44.007 --> 01:45.486
out there in the thoroughfare.

01:45.567 --> 01:47.558
Tell me about that other department.

01:47.647 --> 01:51.242
Inform that fucking lunatic
next you see him...

01:51.727 --> 01:55.037
I'm fit as a fucking fiddle
and ready to play on.

01:55.407 --> 01:57.238
Inform me, Al...

01:57.327 --> 02:01.479
to what mark in your piss-pot
did you fill?

02:02.887 --> 02:05.640
The volume was adequate.
I didn't check the mark.

02:06.447 --> 02:10.122
Any discharge of gleets,
burning or soreness?

02:14.567 --> 02:17.161
I got your suit back from Mr...

02:17.527 --> 02:20.325
It's kind of
aromafied from that solvent.

02:20.527 --> 02:23.166
Why don't you let it cure in the air
for a while, huh, Johnny?

02:24.287 --> 02:27.723
Not on the balcony.
Not on the fucking balcony.

02:31.967 --> 02:34.356
Gleets, burning, soreness?

02:37.007 --> 02:38.998
He's come back to my hotel.

02:40.767 --> 02:41.802
Bullock.

02:42.447 --> 02:45.803
Upstairs to the widow.
I can't say if they're in rut.

02:47.047 --> 02:50.084
I didn't linger
for the song of the bedstead.

02:54.727 --> 02:57.036
Let me go check
on those fucking whores.

02:58.927 --> 03:02.681
No more in that department.
That fucking discussion is over.

03:17.687 --> 03:21.362
I was relieved Mr Star and Mr Utter
weren't more badly injured.

03:22.527 --> 03:23.562
Yes.

03:27.007 --> 03:30.158
I hope my coming to your store
caused no awkwardness.

03:30.687 --> 03:33.804
It was kind of you,
bringing that basket for my family.

03:35.367 --> 03:38.404
May I ask if you had been aware
their arrival was so imminent?

03:38.487 --> 03:39.522
No.

03:42.887 --> 03:46.641
She had written that William
seemed entirely recovered...

03:47.527 --> 03:49.802
but no mention of intending to travel.

03:52.967 --> 03:54.286
He's handsome...

03:54.927 --> 03:56.406
your brother's son.

03:56.487 --> 03:58.125
He's a fine boy.

04:01.567 --> 04:04.035
I would so like to see to your injuries...

04:05.767 --> 04:07.325
however superficially.

04:07.847 --> 04:10.520
My proposal would be
we leave the camp immediately...

04:10.607 --> 04:12.757
or remain and sever connection.

04:17.767 --> 04:19.404
A choice for me to make?

04:20.166 --> 04:23.000
Yes. I don't seek to absolve myself.

04:24.127 --> 04:27.483
I don't believe I'm to be relied upon
for good judgement.

04:28.087 --> 04:30.476
Or even for an account
of your own feelings?

04:30.567 --> 04:32.125
I only know...

04:32.247 --> 04:35.205
that for us to stay
and not sever connection...

04:35.287 --> 04:40.122
would add lying to her humiliation,
renew her humiliation daily.

04:40.207 --> 04:41.606
Yes, I understand.

04:48.727 --> 04:52.197
- You say I must choose immediately?
- Tonight.

04:55.607 --> 04:57.598
Well, I'd need some part of tonight
to consider.

04:57.687 --> 04:58.722
Yes.

04:58.847 --> 05:00.917
Others are involved for me as well.

05:07.527 --> 05:09.119
I'll come back in a few hours.

05:11.487 --> 05:13.717
Be very careful in the interim,
Mr Bullock.

05:15.247 --> 05:17.477
- All right.
- Be careful.

05:35.647 --> 05:37.365
...two, fucking three.

05:39.567 --> 05:40.636
Easy.

05:48.567 --> 05:51.525
- A lovely family, the Bullocks.
- Grand.

05:52.127 --> 05:55.278
Looked forward all this while
and meet them with my load on.

06:02.167 --> 06:04.556
Easy does it. Easy.

06:04.847 --> 06:07.486
...two, fucking three!

06:08.047 --> 06:10.117
- Thank you, Mr Utter.
- Okay.

06:10.647 --> 06:12.365
Much obliged, Mr Merrick.

06:12.527 --> 06:13.755
I got him.

06:14.047 --> 06:15.605
Look the fuck out.

06:16.927 --> 06:18.326
Look the fuck out.

06:24.407 --> 06:26.637
I ought probably to get some weapons.

06:36.007 --> 06:37.122
Why?

06:38.167 --> 06:39.282
What?

06:41.127 --> 06:42.321
Why would you?

06:44.127 --> 06:47.039
Maybe you didn't notice
Bullock was without his gun.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.276
No, I did.

06:48.487 --> 06:50.318
Perhaps with the ringing in your ears...

06:50.407 --> 06:53.763
you didn't hear Mr Bullock say
he'd get his old weapon back.

06:54.967 --> 06:58.164
You think maybe a new one
might be useful to Bullock...

06:58.247 --> 07:00.397
arranging his old one's return?

07:01.047 --> 07:03.197
And more backing his position?

07:13.367 --> 07:15.562
- May I have a word with Sol?
- Sure.

07:18.327 --> 07:21.125
- Will you mind if I hang around awhile?
- Fuck, no.

07:26.967 --> 07:29.606
Self-deluding, interfering motherfucker.

07:42.007 --> 07:43.599
I'm sorry you got shot.

07:44.927 --> 07:46.838
A man like me gets used to it.

07:47.527 --> 07:50.405
If it had came to it, I'd have seen
to dissolving the partnership...

07:50.487 --> 07:52.284
sending your mother the proceeds.

07:53.407 --> 07:56.638
- Why would I expect otherwise?
- And I know you'd do the same.

07:56.727 --> 07:58.399
What are you thinking of?

07:58.847 --> 08:01.077
Along with any funds I might forward.

08:02.487 --> 08:04.478
From the afterlife, you mean?

08:04.687 --> 08:06.882
Any funds I'd send subsequent...

08:07.727 --> 08:10.161
I know you'd administer
in their interest...

08:10.567 --> 08:11.602
Martha and the boy.

08:11.687 --> 08:13.325
Yes, you're correct.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.124
What are you fucking thinking of?

08:19.407 --> 08:21.682
What we've built and been through...

08:21.767 --> 08:24.281
you don't get to walk away
without saying why.

08:24.367 --> 08:25.561
You know why.

08:26.007 --> 08:28.043
That don't mean you don't have to say it.

08:28.127 --> 08:30.846
I'm sick of knowing and you not saying.

08:32.486 --> 08:33.556
I love her.

08:33.647 --> 08:36.241
Good! You fucking said it.

08:37.807 --> 08:39.876
And now I get to tell you you're wrong.

08:40.727 --> 08:43.559
You loved her these months and stayed.

08:43.967 --> 08:46.800
It ain't love that'd make you run,
but shame.

08:47.927 --> 08:49.406
Now let me ask you this...

08:50.767 --> 08:54.157
you think shame would end
when you cleared the fucking camp?

08:55.287 --> 08:57.198
It's shameful either way, Sol.

08:57.687 --> 08:59.723
It's life either way, Seth.

09:02.327 --> 09:03.965
I'm sorry you got shot.

09:04.047 --> 09:06.607
Well, I am, too, but I like being loaded.

09:07.367 --> 09:10.484
I like telling you what the fuck I think,
you cocksucker.

09:10.807 --> 09:12.365
I know you'll see to their interest.

09:12.447 --> 09:14.005
Yes, I will, you cocksucker!

09:14.927 --> 09:18.158
And I like saying "cocksucker. "
What the fuck do you think of that?

09:21.367 --> 09:22.846
Want a fast blowjob?

09:26.487 --> 09:27.556
What?

09:28.007 --> 09:29.645
Quick, open-air blowjob.

09:33.367 --> 09:34.686
No, thank you.

09:35.847 --> 09:37.599
- Bullock.
- Charlie.

09:38.207 --> 09:39.799
Maybe Mr Star will want one.

09:41.887 --> 09:43.878
Thanks for going against orders.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.886
Oh, I'll tell you,
I got such a fucking ringing in my ears.

09:46.967 --> 09:48.605
Thanks for taking my back before.

09:48.807 --> 09:50.081
Oh, you're welcome.

09:51.727 --> 09:55.925
I'll bet your wife and son are overtook
by that lovely home you built them.

09:57.007 --> 10:00.522
And what did that boy say about a crick
in his own front yard?

10:06.167 --> 10:08.078
And that's a fine appearance he makes.

10:09.567 --> 10:13.116
And if you don't mind my saying,
she is one striking woman, Mrs Bullock.

10:14.167 --> 10:15.919
Sense of dignified...

10:16.927 --> 10:18.076
and upright.

10:18.927 --> 10:19.996
Thank you.

10:20.807 --> 10:22.798
Anyways, where the fuck you headed?

10:23.447 --> 10:25.358
To get my things from Al Swearengen.

10:25.567 --> 10:26.556
Oh.

10:26.647 --> 10:28.683
Maybe for a word with Dan Dority, too.

10:29.047 --> 10:31.402
Gave me this fucking headache.

10:34.727 --> 10:36.046
To the Gem then?

10:40.007 --> 10:41.759
Jesus Christ.

10:43.127 --> 10:44.196
I'm faint.

10:45.287 --> 10:46.879
A faintness come over me.

10:47.607 --> 10:48.676
Oh, Jesus.

10:49.287 --> 10:51.676
That's a light-headed fucking sensation.

10:55.407 --> 10:57.443
Did you want to go to your place?

11:00.847 --> 11:02.075
Maybe I should.

11:03.087 --> 11:05.760
Maybe that's the fucking
prudent course.

11:06.567 --> 11:07.761
Give me some weight.

11:08.847 --> 11:09.962
Come on.

11:11.407 --> 11:14.717
Yeah, to not keel forward...

11:14.887 --> 11:16.798
and drown in fucking horseshit.

11:18.847 --> 11:20.041
How are you feeling?

11:20.967 --> 11:25.040
Things are a little wavy-like
before my eyes.

11:27.887 --> 11:30.355
Fuck the Gem. Gem'll fucking wait.

11:31.927 --> 11:34.680
What it's worth,
Yankton's afraid of Bullock.

11:36.847 --> 11:38.246
Don't say no more.

11:38.887 --> 11:40.923
Refrain from explaining yourself.

11:41.567 --> 11:43.239
Till Congress approves...

11:43.727 --> 11:46.400
nothing's to say the hills
get made part of Dakota.

11:47.047 --> 11:48.196
Far as that...

11:48.487 --> 11:50.557
Montana's got pull, Dakota don't.

11:50.847 --> 11:52.883
Montana's got silver for bribes.

11:52.967 --> 11:55.527
And a thieving Indian agent's
all that fucking Dakota's got.

11:55.607 --> 11:57.802
It ain't fucking fresh money to the game.

11:57.887 --> 12:00.447
And how does that argue
for Bullock living or dying?

12:00.527 --> 12:03.041
Yankton thinks Bullock's
Montana's man.

12:05.367 --> 12:06.766
On what basis?

12:06.967 --> 12:10.118
He was favourite of a judge in Helena.
They wanted him in politics.

12:10.527 --> 12:13.599
They figure he's a stalking horse here
for the judge's interest.

12:13.687 --> 12:15.643
Then Yankton's got their head
up their fucking asses...

12:15.727 --> 12:17.558
if they think Bullock's anybody's man.

12:18.447 --> 12:21.007
Hell, Bullock himself don't even know
whose man he is.

12:21.087 --> 12:23.442
In the thoroughfare,
as I readied to stab the cocksucker...

12:23.527 --> 12:25.677
did you have no impulse to hint at this?

12:25.767 --> 12:27.246
Moment didn't seem right.

12:27.327 --> 12:29.602
Over time, your quickness
with a cocky rejoinder...

12:29.687 --> 12:31.917
must have gotten you
many punches in the face.

12:32.007 --> 12:33.360
Depends what you call "many. "

12:33.447 --> 12:35.563
There's another fucking clever one.

12:37.447 --> 12:39.005
To Yankton's thinking...

12:41.007 --> 12:43.316
would Bullock dead
curb Montana's interests...

12:43.407 --> 12:45.637
or incite them to a stronger expression?

12:46.247 --> 12:47.282
I don't know.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.803
If he's spoiling to mix it with us further
I may get a chance to find out.

12:57.047 --> 12:58.366
He will leave with me...

12:59.407 --> 13:01.238
if I tell him that's my wish.

13:04.407 --> 13:07.365
As to what our life would be,
that's another question.

13:07.887 --> 13:12.199
I would say, ma'am,
it might be like living atop a volcano.

13:15.487 --> 13:18.240
- That's been done, Miss Isringhausen.
- Certainly.

13:18.967 --> 13:21.197
And with a good deal of excitement,
I should think.

13:21.287 --> 13:23.642
A sense of high adventure every day.

13:25.807 --> 13:27.081
And, of course, danger.

13:28.167 --> 13:30.476
As to excitement, would you possibly...

13:31.407 --> 13:32.601
add happiness?

13:33.207 --> 13:35.004
Why not, Mrs Garret?

13:38.047 --> 13:40.322
- Please don't be angry with me, ma'am.
- No.

13:48.007 --> 13:49.281
We do love each other.

13:51.207 --> 13:55.120
Our being together ought not to seem
so outlandish a proposition.

13:55.647 --> 13:56.716
No, ma'am.

13:58.647 --> 14:00.319
Except for every other single thing.

14:02.527 --> 14:03.960
Clear it out of there.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.121
Oh, boy.

14:06.727 --> 14:09.321
Yeah, there you go.
Thank you, thank you, Bullock.

14:13.087 --> 14:16.796
- All right.
- I'm next to completely collected.

14:19.967 --> 14:23.004
Three separate occasions
I've been shot at, hit...

14:23.927 --> 14:25.280
and fought on.

14:25.407 --> 14:29.002
And now, a miss takes my equilibrium.

14:29.887 --> 14:31.320
Anyways...

14:32.567 --> 14:34.876
- You want to get to the Gem, huh?
- Yeah.

14:35.087 --> 14:36.156
Why?

14:37.807 --> 14:38.876
I told you why.

14:39.767 --> 14:42.406
I mean why just this instant...

14:42.487 --> 14:45.763
say, different from later a little while...

14:46.527 --> 14:48.836
when a friend could back your play?

14:49.087 --> 14:52.318
I mean,
someplace you need to get to after that?

15:13.527 --> 15:15.563
I got the elements stored in the back.

15:16.487 --> 15:18.364
I hope to Christ you do.

15:19.807 --> 15:20.876
Come in.

15:21.047 --> 15:23.322
Don't anyone bolt for freedom.

15:26.607 --> 15:30.156
Kept accumulating them secret
so Cy wouldn't think I was proceeding.

15:38.687 --> 15:40.359
Well, well, well.

15:40.447 --> 15:42.005
There's the wallpaper you sent, Maddie.

15:42.087 --> 15:43.236
Yes, ma'am.

15:43.607 --> 15:46.644
Ladies, why don't you put your attention
to some of the lighter furniture...

15:46.727 --> 15:50.686
and we'll hire some great minds
to do the heavy lifting?

15:51.447 --> 15:54.359
Roll up your sleeves, Doris.
Hard work dispels worry.

15:58.127 --> 15:59.765
I pray to God your shoulder pain's...

15:59.847 --> 16:03.476
like some sharp-toothed creature's
inside chewing at it and gnawing.

16:04.887 --> 16:06.718
How did I give offence?

16:06.967 --> 16:09.800
No one needs feeling as good as
you'd feel otherwise.

16:12.087 --> 16:13.281
I say it from...

16:14.647 --> 16:16.126
fucking experience.

16:18.087 --> 16:21.318
And I didn't need
the fucking activity today...

16:21.807 --> 16:23.638
and the fucking crises.

16:25.247 --> 16:27.681
I prefer sucking prick
is the fucking short of it.

16:29.527 --> 16:32.724
I'd settle for a vigorous handholding.

16:35.167 --> 16:37.397
You are a funny fucking Jew.

16:41.447 --> 16:43.722
And type that insinuates himself.

16:52.447 --> 16:54.244
General principle...

16:54.887 --> 16:58.562
I believe in fostering people's tries
at improving their selves...

16:59.247 --> 17:02.956
and I think you all also know
that I got a special fondness...

17:03.247 --> 17:04.839
for Joanie Stubbs.

17:05.367 --> 17:07.085
And if those things wasn't true...

17:07.446 --> 17:10.803
in this camp, at this precise juncture,
I, Cy Tolliver...

17:10.926 --> 17:12.565
would not have backed...

17:12.646 --> 17:14.842
an exclusively high-end
whoring operation...

17:14.926 --> 17:19.318
at the far fucking end of the camp,
without concealed access for its trade.

17:20.767 --> 17:23.122
But, be that as it may...

17:23.207 --> 17:26.756
and wishing Joanie Godspeed...

17:27.607 --> 17:30.917
this congregation gathers
so that I can assure each of you...

17:31.087 --> 17:33.806
that our operation
here at the Bella Union...

17:33.887 --> 17:35.798
is organised exactly...

17:35.967 --> 17:38.561
to capitalise
on what this camp is ready for...

17:38.727 --> 17:40.638
and for what it's going to become.

17:41.887 --> 17:43.684
I want each of you...

17:43.767 --> 17:45.564
to take one of these...

17:47.127 --> 17:50.437
as a gesture of optimism and good will.

18:06.047 --> 18:07.878
Keep your fucking distance!

18:07.967 --> 18:10.276
Remain on your side of the street!

18:10.487 --> 18:12.921
Do not interfere with me in any way!

18:13.367 --> 18:15.403
Chinese cocksuckers!

18:29.327 --> 18:30.316
Jesus.

18:37.447 --> 18:42.043
Well, you are an entangled inebriate,
are you not?

18:42.247 --> 18:45.637
This happens to be
a rig and contraption...

18:45.727 --> 18:47.604
of my own devising...

18:47.687 --> 18:51.157
against repeated accidental falls...

18:51.247 --> 18:54.319
that has temporarily malfunctioned.

18:54.847 --> 18:56.917
Very well knotted.

18:59.527 --> 19:01.404
I'm back in camp, Cochran...

19:02.007 --> 19:03.804
'cause I'm dying...

19:04.407 --> 19:07.717
and I need a place
to breathe my fucking last...

19:08.247 --> 19:12.035
and not for
no human aid or consolation.

19:14.607 --> 19:17.644
Jesus Christ,
you're bad with your hands!

19:17.727 --> 19:20.719
If I wasn't practically fucking dead,
I'd reach that knife...

19:20.807 --> 19:22.559
and cut myself free.

19:22.687 --> 19:24.518
Yeah, I just farted. So what?

19:24.607 --> 19:26.916
Hey! Don't you...

19:27.007 --> 19:29.646
disarm me, you cocksucker!

19:29.727 --> 19:32.321
Lift me up so I can cut myself free.

19:34.967 --> 19:36.798
All right, you ready?

19:41.847 --> 19:43.599
All right now, give me that other hand.

19:46.167 --> 19:47.282
Now...

19:49.087 --> 19:50.600
step inside...

19:51.007 --> 19:53.965
and let me examine you,
even if you are past help.

19:54.407 --> 19:58.366
Enhancing my understanding
may allow others the benefit...

19:58.647 --> 20:01.525
of your mortal illness.

20:04.207 --> 20:07.358
- Do you mock me, cocksucker?
- No.

20:09.127 --> 20:10.845
Come on inside.

20:11.967 --> 20:13.366
All right...

20:13.727 --> 20:15.922
- there we go.
- Promise when I'm dead...

20:16.007 --> 20:18.999
you'll plant me
with a view of where Bill is.

20:20.727 --> 20:22.877
He couldn't have meant that,
not possibly.

20:23.047 --> 20:24.878
Well, I shouldn't have thought so.

20:24.967 --> 20:27.879
You don't believe he imagines,
were he and I to go...

20:27.967 --> 20:29.241
I'd leave Sofia behind?

20:30.127 --> 20:33.199
I can't be certain, Mrs Garret.
I didn't hear him speak.

20:33.607 --> 20:36.679
Because others
rescued her and nursed her...

20:36.847 --> 20:39.566
is the idea that
she belongs to the camp?

20:39.647 --> 20:42.480
Are we some sort of
vicious, filthy outpost of Brook Farm?

20:44.647 --> 20:46.285
She's been with me for seven months.

20:47.527 --> 20:50.121
She's a part of my life as I am of hers.

20:52.727 --> 20:54.080
He couldn't have.

20:57.767 --> 20:59.439
I will not.

21:00.087 --> 21:01.759
Jane, for me...

21:01.887 --> 21:05.675
the female breast has long ago
lost all mystery or allure.

21:05.767 --> 21:08.645
Open your goddamn blouse.

21:20.367 --> 21:22.642
I'm keeping my eyes shut...

21:23.167 --> 21:25.886
but I'll know every fucking move
you make!

21:27.607 --> 21:30.121
I'll have you further promise...

21:30.767 --> 21:31.916
that you won't...

21:32.007 --> 21:35.158
forage in my remains after I'm dead...

21:35.247 --> 21:38.603
as you obviously don't scruple
from that type of sick behaviour.

21:38.767 --> 21:40.041
I promise.

21:41.607 --> 21:44.883
All right, sit up if you're not too drunk.

21:56.087 --> 21:58.555
Your liver runs from your chin...

21:58.847 --> 22:01.805
to your genitals.
So I suggest you quit drinking.

22:03.167 --> 22:06.079
I will when you do,
you ugly son of a bitch.

22:06.167 --> 22:07.316
Nature...

22:07.687 --> 22:09.643
is a forgiving mistress...

22:09.767 --> 22:11.962
and you might could have
some time to fill...

22:12.047 --> 22:14.038
before she collects her due.

22:14.447 --> 22:18.565
As if I'd credit any opinions of yours
on the subject of health.

22:18.647 --> 22:21.878
Well, if you do care
to sojourn among us...

22:22.527 --> 22:27.043
Charlie Utter has put aside
a room for you at the freight building.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.724
Does he have any animals in there?

22:31.927 --> 22:33.406
Fort Cooper...

22:34.127 --> 22:36.118
on the Butterfield Stage Route.

22:36.527 --> 22:39.325
I know that fort. On the Brazos.

22:39.567 --> 22:41.000
That's where I found him.

22:42.647 --> 22:44.160
I was 13.

22:45.327 --> 22:47.318
He had to send me back.

22:47.887 --> 22:49.081
But...

22:49.647 --> 22:51.046
we had a...

22:52.287 --> 22:54.562
good talk before I left.

22:57.127 --> 22:59.800
Probably I'd have come
looking for him again, but...

23:00.127 --> 23:02.038
next year was the war.

23:02.607 --> 23:06.486
Robert was cavalry.
No way to locate where he was.

23:07.047 --> 23:09.925
The fucking war had
everyone all over everywhere.

23:10.887 --> 23:12.081
We wrote.

23:14.847 --> 23:18.283
Less after my father passed
and I headed to Montana.

23:20.847 --> 23:23.315
I had letters when he married...

23:24.727 --> 23:26.638
when they had their boy.

23:27.087 --> 23:29.157
And we'd threaten visits.

23:30.647 --> 23:34.037
When I finally did come to Fort Quitman
where Robert was posted...

23:34.807 --> 23:36.286
and met Martha...

23:36.927 --> 23:38.440
and William...

23:39.367 --> 23:41.244
Robert wasn't there. He was...

23:41.887 --> 23:45.084
following back some raid
across the Rio Grande.

23:47.287 --> 23:49.164
I let it wait too long.

23:52.567 --> 23:55.559
He got shot and killed in Mexico...

23:55.847 --> 23:57.439
and was buried there.

23:58.447 --> 24:00.085
Fucking Mexico.

24:02.647 --> 24:05.286
Went down, found him...

24:06.767 --> 24:08.166
and brought him back.

24:09.447 --> 24:11.438
Wrong to let him lay there...

24:13.327 --> 24:14.726
unless you're a Mexican.

24:28.167 --> 24:30.635
My bowels are in a upheaval.

24:32.567 --> 24:35.479
I'll walk off to pass wind.

24:38.247 --> 24:40.556
Don't ever say
I'm not a fucking gentleman.

24:41.807 --> 24:43.240
Fuck you two.

24:50.127 --> 24:51.401
Number 10...

24:52.087 --> 24:54.999
ruled me off, the round-eyed toad.

24:56.647 --> 24:57.796
Cocksucker.

25:00.447 --> 25:04.235
My concern,
past your physical well-being...

25:04.327 --> 25:07.478
is what the dispute portends.

25:07.647 --> 25:09.046
Yeah, I don't know.

25:09.887 --> 25:11.366
Is it settled between you two...

25:11.447 --> 25:13.358
or still unresolved?

25:13.447 --> 25:14.675
I don't fucking know.

25:15.367 --> 25:18.484
- Your ribs are hurting, ain't they?
- Yeah, they fucking hurt.

25:19.687 --> 25:23.123
Well, I always believed,
of his sufferings on the cross...

25:23.727 --> 25:26.002
his busted ribs
would have hurt him the worst.

25:27.447 --> 25:30.280
Hey, Adams? Cutthroat friend.

25:30.967 --> 25:33.003
And I thought you was in Florida...

25:33.087 --> 25:35.362
having your belly rubbed by a Seminole.

25:37.087 --> 25:38.236
What the fuck?

25:38.447 --> 25:40.438
You ain't going to believe
what happened to me, boss.

25:40.527 --> 25:43.405
Kate Hogranch is part of this story
and fucking that half-breed?

25:43.487 --> 25:44.681
Go ahead and try me.

25:44.767 --> 25:46.485
That's not the stop that detained me.

25:46.767 --> 25:49.839
I'm past my fill of this shit.
Next time don't fucking catch up.

25:54.127 --> 25:56.243
Guess the day
of the Samaritan's passed.

25:56.727 --> 25:59.878
Stopped to help stranded sisters. Hi.

26:01.967 --> 26:03.923
Severe reprimand.

26:22.367 --> 26:25.040
Them two
seem disputatious as well, huh?

26:25.127 --> 26:26.879
Storm clouds gather.

26:36.167 --> 26:38.362
Think you about got her
clean there, Hoss.

26:38.447 --> 26:40.358
Another fucking clever one.

26:40.487 --> 26:43.524
You know, I bet when
you and your partner's out on the trail...

26:43.687 --> 26:47.077
when you ain't greasing poles
and choosing who's going to be rider...

26:47.287 --> 26:51.121
I bet you and him just bust each other's
guts with your little fucking funnies.

26:51.567 --> 26:54.718
Well, we do laugh some about you-

27:00.927 --> 27:04.158
Let's hear a belly giggle now,
you cocksucker.

27:08.967 --> 27:10.161
No.

27:10.487 --> 27:11.636
God damn it!

27:11.727 --> 27:14.480
Christ, that's one country ass-kicking!

27:14.807 --> 27:16.286
Shut your fucking mouth!

27:20.727 --> 27:23.958
Oh, you just 12-pointed Slippery Dan.

27:28.447 --> 27:32.122
Next one is to your head, Dan.
Do not doubt me.

27:34.447 --> 27:36.244
Well, that's just fucking great.

27:38.007 --> 27:39.565
That's fucking beautiful.

27:40.167 --> 27:42.840
Feels like a cannonball up my ass.

27:43.807 --> 27:47.436
Fellow in Livingston went sweet on me.

27:48.887 --> 27:50.639
Finnish fellow from Finland.

27:50.727 --> 27:52.399
Hardly spoke fucking English.

27:52.887 --> 27:54.366
Brought me flowers...

27:54.447 --> 27:56.915
and some dry food they like there.

27:57.287 --> 27:59.118
And, one night...

27:59.447 --> 28:02.917
he takes my arm, and he starts in...

28:03.887 --> 28:07.880
and he whispers in his Finland accent:

28:09.767 --> 28:11.962
"I want to suck your cock. "

28:21.167 --> 28:22.725
What do you fucking think of that?

28:25.407 --> 28:29.161
I missed the end part, Jane.
Can't practically hear fuck-all.

28:29.767 --> 28:32.565
A fucking bullet near creased my ear.

28:32.687 --> 28:35.042
It didn't do your face
no fucking favours neither.

28:35.127 --> 28:36.924
- Yeah.
- Put him to sleep.

28:37.647 --> 28:40.844
- I got to go.
- No, wait.

28:41.167 --> 28:42.566
Wait.

28:44.647 --> 28:46.638
- Let me get weapons.
- For what?

28:46.727 --> 28:49.719
I told you,
we was involved in a falling-out.

28:50.767 --> 28:53.327
I guess, hostilities...

28:54.487 --> 28:56.717
may be about to resume.

28:56.807 --> 28:59.560
You going to tell me now
who it was with?

29:00.407 --> 29:01.635
Swearengen.

29:01.807 --> 29:04.446
The limey cocksucker
nearly did for a little one?

29:05.647 --> 29:08.320
Why the fuck was you
withholding that information?

29:08.607 --> 29:13.556
In the futile hope of preventing you
roiling the fucking waters.

29:14.087 --> 29:17.318
How is that little one
the limey cocksucker nearly killed?

29:17.407 --> 29:19.443
Still in the care of the widow Garret?

29:22.527 --> 29:24.324
I'll have my badge and gun back.

29:24.407 --> 29:25.635
Well...

29:26.047 --> 29:29.244
go get the fucking weapons
for us to back him, Charlie.

29:30.687 --> 29:33.155
Let me just wake my fucking watchman.

29:45.847 --> 29:48.202
Alcoholic encephalopathy.

29:51.167 --> 29:52.441
Wet brain.

30:00.847 --> 30:02.166
$5.

30:29.447 --> 30:31.244
Anything else I can do for you, boss?

30:33.767 --> 30:35.086
Keep up.

30:46.527 --> 30:49.837
Just save your fucking words, Al.
Don't waste your precious time.

30:49.927 --> 30:52.839
You got any orders, you just
send Adams and he can deliver them.

30:54.887 --> 30:56.286
You chose!

30:56.927 --> 30:58.838
You took his fucking part!

30:58.927 --> 31:01.964
As was right and fucking proper
at the time.

31:02.047 --> 31:03.799
Yeah, but you pointed
the fucking gun at me!

31:03.887 --> 31:06.401
And persuaded you I'd use it
in order that I didn't need to.

31:08.327 --> 31:09.521
Dan.

31:11.847 --> 31:13.724
Where you or me would have...

31:13.807 --> 31:16.367
slammed that hoople up,
planted him back...

31:16.447 --> 31:17.880
and twisted the cocksucker...

31:17.967 --> 31:21.084
till all the points of that buck's rack
showed out of his chest...

31:21.167 --> 31:25.001
and then done it twice more in case
the fuck mistook the first for accident...

31:25.087 --> 31:26.600
what did Adams do?

31:30.047 --> 31:31.924
He fucking walked away.

31:32.327 --> 31:34.124
Different man from you and me.

31:36.127 --> 31:37.845
Whatever lurks ahead...

31:38.007 --> 31:40.885
of grievous abominations and disorder...

31:42.407 --> 31:45.558
you and me walk into it together,
like always.

31:49.327 --> 31:50.965
As you'd never say to Adams?

31:52.407 --> 31:54.238
As I'd never say to Adams.

32:03.767 --> 32:05.644
Send fucking Dolly up, huh?

32:06.967 --> 32:08.719
Yeah, sure thing, boss.

32:12.487 --> 32:14.239
When I first came to this camp...

32:14.927 --> 32:16.599
and for many years before...

32:16.807 --> 32:19.002
I depended on spirits of laudanum.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.877
May I ask against what indisposition?

32:24.807 --> 32:26.559
Various indispositions.

32:27.727 --> 32:30.036
The remedy was invariable.

32:33.327 --> 32:37.002
Caring for Sofia has been a great joy...

32:38.647 --> 32:40.239
and a great freedom.

32:42.007 --> 32:46.762
To give up her care in love's name
or any other...

32:49.447 --> 32:51.005
the selfishness of that...

32:55.407 --> 32:56.806
I'd be too afraid.

32:59.327 --> 33:03.115
- I ain't never seen a man killed like that.
- By God, I'll tell you what, Johnny...

33:03.407 --> 33:05.796
there'd have been
a hell of a lot more than two tines...

33:05.887 --> 33:09.482
sticking through that cocksucker's chest
if it had been me or Al impaling him.

33:09.567 --> 33:11.205
Jesus Christ!

33:12.087 --> 33:16.638
Either Al got God or Dolly just
stuck her thumb back up his ass.

33:16.727 --> 33:20.356
Oh. Now, I'm halfway thinking...

33:20.447 --> 33:23.723
this exaggerates the condition
rather than alleviates it.

33:24.447 --> 33:25.675
If I might should query the Doc...

33:25.767 --> 33:29.043
but then that cocksucker
will only ask after gleets.

33:31.367 --> 33:34.404
Oh, my God, take it out.

33:35.687 --> 33:38.997
Take it out. Remove your fucking thumb.

33:43.367 --> 33:46.962
Why, if I was moving forward
to get away from you...

33:47.047 --> 33:48.685
would you have fucking pursued me?

33:49.127 --> 33:53.643
When I stopped, pressed on yourself
to drive your thumb into my intestine?

33:53.727 --> 33:54.876
Sorry.

33:56.487 --> 33:59.160
Is it a river of blood,
or what the fuck's pouring out of it now?

33:59.767 --> 34:00.882
Nothing.

34:03.087 --> 34:04.315
Close the ass-flap.

34:06.447 --> 34:11.396
The entire area of my fucking asshole
is now one gigantic fucking throb.

34:11.647 --> 34:14.206
I have no idea
what's transpiring in there.

34:14.286 --> 34:17.040
- Shall I suck your prick?
- Please.

34:42.327 --> 34:44.237
Does he want to fucking die?

34:44.567 --> 34:47.445
I understand
that has its fucking appeal...

34:48.047 --> 34:51.676
but not going out a fucking cunt,
taking others fucking with you.

34:52.167 --> 34:54.043
Dulled faculties.

34:55.647 --> 34:59.720
Your fucking stupid fuck
of a stupid fucking partner...

35:02.367 --> 35:03.846
Wants to die?

35:05.847 --> 35:07.485
Help me, Trixie.

35:11.887 --> 35:14.685
Even this now gives me no pleasure.

35:15.607 --> 35:19.759
Swearengen! Be down in five minutes
with my gun and badge!

35:20.287 --> 35:22.517
Start down now, you limey cocksucker!

35:23.207 --> 35:26.085
Allow for getting stuck crawling out
from under the bed!

35:26.287 --> 35:28.721
That Bullock's a fucking strategist,
ain't he?

35:30.047 --> 35:33.244
Sets terms to publicly humiliate me...

35:33.767 --> 35:36.998
and my penalty if I don't comply
is he walks into the bar downstairs...

35:37.087 --> 35:41.126
and takes 15 bullets in the chest.
And that ain't no hooplehead, you know.

35:41.207 --> 35:43.846
Bullock, he's one of those
special fucking cases.

35:43.927 --> 35:46.395
You don't know what in fuck's going on
in their mind.

35:46.487 --> 35:49.240
And he's big with Montana.

35:49.847 --> 35:50.962
Big.

35:52.407 --> 35:53.806
I heard that today.

35:54.687 --> 35:57.565
Because the news earlier from Yankton
and the fucking commissioners...

35:57.647 --> 35:59.956
wasn't adequately confusing.

36:00.927 --> 36:03.725
Not to mention
the fucking telegraph coming in...

36:03.807 --> 36:06.560
and four whores that I don't know
who the fuck they work for.

36:06.647 --> 36:09.764
- Three minutes!
- Shut the fuck up!

36:11.567 --> 36:13.637
I suppose I do fucking understand...

36:15.087 --> 36:19.956
so fucking confused and disgusted
and wanting it to end and...

36:21.407 --> 36:23.443
looking for the blessing
of a quick way out.

36:23.807 --> 36:27.356
Sets himself to a higher
fucking standard than our natures...

36:27.847 --> 36:30.361
and he wants execution
'cause he's failed.

36:30.447 --> 36:33.041
- One minute!
- What the fuck happened to two?

36:36.247 --> 36:37.680
Talk about one person...

36:38.407 --> 36:42.195
fucking up another person's
entire fucking day.

36:48.287 --> 36:49.402
Wait.

36:52.167 --> 36:55.159
- I'd best go over.
- Wait.

36:59.767 --> 37:03.726
You linger awhile.
Do not think of thieving, huh?

37:11.927 --> 37:13.155
Johnny.

37:13.927 --> 37:17.124
Produce that coal-oil-stinking suit.

37:20.607 --> 37:22.518
Unless you'd rather get it for me.

37:26.687 --> 37:30.123
Wish to fuck you two would let me
finish this the way I prefer.

37:30.767 --> 37:35.124
Well, we wish to fuck
you'd find something else to wish for.

37:37.447 --> 37:39.563
Jesus Christ! I'm unarmed.

37:40.207 --> 37:43.279
He's coming. He's detained.
Getting dressed.

37:43.367 --> 37:46.200
Ain't it always a trial
picking out the gown...

37:46.287 --> 37:48.642
best conceals
you fucking pissed yourself?

37:55.967 --> 37:57.764
I recommend the six-shooter...

37:57.847 --> 38:01.840
being this rifle's first recoil's liable
to knock you unconscious with pain.

38:04.207 --> 38:05.356
Thank you.

38:13.887 --> 38:15.366
Selfish cocksucker.

38:35.727 --> 38:39.766
That's not to say,
should the situation deteriorate...

38:40.847 --> 38:43.645
you boys wouldn't open fire
from concealment, huh?

38:52.327 --> 38:55.558
Hardware Jew at less than full force,
now they'll be fucking quaking.

39:05.247 --> 39:07.761
I regret the delay, I was sequestered.

39:07.967 --> 39:10.765
Have been, one thing and another
since last we met.

39:11.367 --> 39:14.564
I also apologise for the stink.

39:14.647 --> 39:17.445
Welcome change
from your usual odour of skunk.

39:25.167 --> 39:26.759
I offer these...

39:27.847 --> 39:31.123
and I hope you'll wear them a good
long fucking time in this fucking camp...

39:31.207 --> 39:32.959
whosever fucking thumb we're under.

39:33.407 --> 39:35.602
And where it come to me,
just a few moments ago...

39:35.687 --> 39:38.884
that the Reverend Smith,
may he rest his soul...

39:39.287 --> 39:40.720
he was found on the road...

39:42.207 --> 39:44.641
apparently murdered by heathens
just some months ago.

39:45.367 --> 39:49.121
What he said on the subject of you,
"Mr Bullock raises a camp up...

39:49.327 --> 39:51.283
"and I hope he'll reside with us...

39:52.407 --> 39:55.319
"and improve our
general fucking atmosphere...

39:55.407 --> 39:58.479
"for a good long fucking time.

39:58.727 --> 40:01.116
"Even with
all the personal complications...

40:01.207 --> 40:04.517
"and fucking disasters
that we all fucking have...

40:05.007 --> 40:07.999
"and where, running away...

40:08.967 --> 40:11.765
"solves absolutely fucking nothing. "

40:21.927 --> 40:23.406
Did you find my hat?

40:27.167 --> 40:30.477
Dolly! You look for the Sheriff's hat.

40:32.287 --> 40:36.166
Remember the Reverend's
half-dead face, that cockeyed look...

40:36.247 --> 40:38.715
like he was the victim
of a lightning stroke?

40:41.527 --> 40:43.882
May she sail it down
or would that be degrading?

40:43.967 --> 40:46.117
- No.
- Toss it, Dolly.

40:48.847 --> 40:50.758
Wish her aim was as good
with her thumb.

41:24.647 --> 41:28.322
When the opportunity offers itself,
please return this to Mr Bullock.

41:31.007 --> 41:32.042
Yes, ma'am.

42:00.887 --> 42:03.082
- Mr Bullock-
- I don't want to talk about it.

42:04.127 --> 42:05.526
As a practical matter...

42:05.607 --> 42:09.759
self-censorship of the rigour
which obtains from this camp...

42:09.847 --> 42:13.556
so muzzles the press
as to make the First Amendment...

42:13.647 --> 42:16.957
- a hollow superfluity.
- Thank you.

42:18.887 --> 42:21.879
- She can situate me.
- All right.

42:36.767 --> 42:39.361
Man says he's finished,
needs to get to his claim.

42:39.447 --> 42:42.086
Four hours' work, he's earned $2.

42:42.367 --> 42:43.925
Says he wants to take it in pussy.

42:45.127 --> 42:49.518
No, you want cash, Elmer, to convert
to pussy at the Gem or Bella Union.

42:49.847 --> 42:51.963
All right, Joanie.

42:52.047 --> 42:56.199
And let it be known in camp, close to
pussy as $2 will get a man in here...

42:56.287 --> 42:58.482
is a deep whiff walking past.

42:58.887 --> 43:02.357
Hey, can I get one of those
and keep my money?

43:02.447 --> 43:03.482
Have at it.

43:03.567 --> 43:06.081
Fan some at him, Rosie,
as he's leaving.

43:08.447 --> 43:10.119
Mother, it's the ocean.

43:20.887 --> 43:24.357
There's a rodent-looking creature
lamping one of your barrels.

43:24.647 --> 43:27.400
Pay him no heed. That's the mayor.

43:29.127 --> 43:32.244
You're tenacious, Merrick,
I'll fucking give you that.

43:32.527 --> 43:34.165
Just tell me how it began.

43:34.647 --> 43:38.640
As to the conflict's genesis,
I'd lay it at cunt's doorstep.

43:39.127 --> 43:42.483
Now, has cunt one "n" and two "t's"
or the other way around?

43:42.727 --> 43:44.126
Jeez, Al.

43:44.447 --> 43:47.439
You solicited the true account.

43:47.527 --> 43:50.087
Within the limits of decency.

43:50.167 --> 43:53.318
You want the decent truth, huh?

43:53.407 --> 43:57.241
I choose to believe that
truth and decency need not be at odds.

43:57.327 --> 43:59.841
Oh, you'll hear no argument from me.

44:00.167 --> 44:05.002
Let it help me accumulate capital,
or at worst, not interfere.

44:05.407 --> 44:08.240
The story is true and decent.

44:09.247 --> 44:12.842
I would define as true and decent
in such endeavour...

44:13.007 --> 44:17.956
the facts rendered fully, within
social standards and sensibilities...

44:18.607 --> 44:21.326
without bias or abridgement.

44:23.167 --> 44:27.046
Why do I imagine
a snake swallowing its tail?

44:27.727 --> 44:28.921
Which is to say...

44:29.007 --> 44:33.956
the economic motive is but one strand
in the social tapestry...

44:34.087 --> 44:36.476
my exemplary account would weave.

44:36.807 --> 44:41.403
Ass-fucking the dirt worshippers being
another is a pleasure beyond gain.

44:41.487 --> 44:45.526
- No, now, now, now, I-
- Wait, was that your heathen imitation?

44:45.607 --> 44:48.360
Jump up and down a few times
and shout out "whoops" as in...

44:48.447 --> 44:50.563
"Whoops, that ass-fucking hurts. "

44:50.647 --> 44:53.923
A more elevated perspective
would construe our conduct...

44:54.007 --> 44:58.876
as white men to be enacting
a manifest destiny.

44:59.287 --> 45:04.236
Whereas the warp, woof, and
fucking weave of my story's tapestry...

45:04.927 --> 45:07.760
would foster
the illusions of further commerce.

45:12.087 --> 45:15.557
Tonight, throughout Deadwood...

45:16.087 --> 45:21.036
heads may be laid to pillow
assuaged and reassured...

45:21.967 --> 45:25.516
for that purveyor for profit
of everything sordid and vicious...

45:25.607 --> 45:27.598
Al Swearengen, already...

45:27.687 --> 45:31.236
beaten to a fare-thee-well
earlier in the day by Sheriff Bullock...

45:31.487 --> 45:33.079
has returned to the Sheriff...

45:33.167 --> 45:36.204
the implements and ornaments
of his office.

45:40.887 --> 45:45.039
Without the tawdry walls
of Swearengen's saloon, the Gem...

45:46.607 --> 45:50.919
decent citizens may pursue
with a new and jaunty freedom...

45:51.007 --> 45:53.441
all aspects of Christian commerce.

45:54.527 --> 45:57.087
In which connection,
we particularly recommend...

45:57.167 --> 46:00.716
And there you'd throw in
the names of a few businesses...

46:00.807 --> 46:03.002
gave you good-sized adverts...

46:11.127 --> 46:14.642
- May I come in with my boots?
- Of course.

46:18.767 --> 46:22.601
- You haven't slept?
- I waited for you.

46:31.687 --> 46:35.043
To show the boy when he awakes,
I've got these back.

46:57.527 --> 47:00.997
I saw that you installed
a bundling board in the bed upstairs.

47:02.527 --> 47:03.562
I did.

47:04.567 --> 47:06.922
I hope you don't mind that I removed it.

47:10.287 --> 47:11.356
No.

47:15.927 --> 47:19.442
A full fair-mindedness requires us
also to report...

47:20.167 --> 47:23.398
that within the Gem,
on Deadwood's main thoroughfare...

47:23.807 --> 47:26.605
comely whores,
decently-priced liquor...

47:26.687 --> 47:29.485
and the squarest games of chance
in the hills...

47:29.767 --> 47:34.283
remain unabatedly available
at all hours, seven days a week.
