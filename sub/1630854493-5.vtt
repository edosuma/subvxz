[Dustin] We have to get this
dredge to the dock site.

00:09.367 --> 00:11.066
[Carlos] I don't know
how this is going to work.

00:11.066 --> 00:12.767
[Dustin] I don't need that
right now.

00:12.767 --> 00:15.567
Let's fail before you tell me
it's not gonna work.
All right.

00:15.567 --> 00:19.400
All right, Wes.
Let's see if we can move it.

00:36.767 --> 00:39.266
It's actually driving
the [bleep] truck.

00:39.266 --> 00:41.100

00:41.166 --> 00:43.166

[Carlos] All stop.
All stop, all stop.

00:51.767 --> 00:53.266
[Dustin] It's not gonna
make that turn, is it?

00:53.266 --> 00:56.800
-[Carlos] Nope.
-It's bringing it
right here, for all this.

00:56.867 --> 00:59.667
[Dustin] All right, Wes.
We're gonna do some
heavy off-roading.

00:59.667 --> 01:00.000
[Wes] Copy that.
Are you ready to go?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
[Wes] Copy that.
Are you ready to go?

01:01.367 --> 01:03.000

[Dustin] All stop,
all stop, all stop.

01:09.867 --> 01:11.600
[Wes] It's not gonna
make it over that rock.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.166
[Wes] It's stuck.

01:16.166 --> 01:17.700
That's never gonna work.

01:20.100 --> 01:22.266
[man 2] Careful on that.
It slipped out on me just now.

01:22.266 --> 01:24.266
[Carlos] Whoa.

01:24.266 --> 01:26.266
[Wes] We are pulling
some boulders today.

01:30.100 --> 01:31.000
[Carlos] Oh.
[bleep] Something broke.

01:32.367 --> 01:34.100
[bleep] My chest hurts.

01:34.100 --> 01:37.767
[Dustin] So I'm either having
a [bleep] heart attack
or an anxiety attack.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.266
[Dustin] I don't encourage
this behavior.

-Kayla is a beast.

01:46.367 --> 01:47.867
I just try to keep up.

01:51.867 --> 01:54.700
[Scott] We are in the water.
We are mining now.

01:54.767 --> 01:58.000
Please stay working.
Please.

01:58.066 --> 02:00.000
Even with their head start,
my crew still got our dredge

02:16.367 --> 02:17.567

02:52.467 --> 02:54.600

02:54.667 --> 02:56.266
If we're completely
wasting our time,

02:56.266 --> 02:58.567

I'm afraid I have news
that you probably
don't want to hear.

04:07.066 --> 04:11.100
I really think we need to get
some lumber and actually do
a lower walkway.

04:12.266 --> 04:13.600
[Dustin] It's not
that I don't want to.

04:13.667 --> 04:15.900
I don't think I could
afford it, honestly.

04:15.967 --> 04:17.567
Bringing a stack of lumber
out here

04:17.567 --> 04:21.367
doesn't cost just $100
a board. It's like...

04:22.767 --> 04:25.266
-[Kayla] No, I get it.
-A lot more.

04:25.266 --> 04:28.567
Well, it's not that
we don't want to cut
the trail.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.467
We're running into

04:30.467 --> 04:31.000
[Dustin] All right.
There has to be another way.

04:34.066 --> 04:36.000
Well, let me see if I can
get some big trees.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.767
If I dragged giant straight
cottonwoods up here,
would that work for you?

04:40.767 --> 04:43.567
[Kayla] I think that's going
to be better than this.

04:43.567 --> 04:46.867
[Dustin] All right.
Let's do something different.

04:46.867 --> 04:51.166
[narrator] <i>Kayla's site</i>
<i>is 600 feet up creek</i>
<i>from Dustin's,</i>

04:51.166 --> 04:57.100

<i>section of sheer cliff face</i>

05:34.967 --> 05:36.000
[Carlos] Oh.

05:36.066 --> 05:37.567
[Dustin] Yeah, hop on.

05:40.066 --> 05:42.166
I've got two of them
over there that might work.

05:43.266 --> 05:45.667
I'm also scared
there's a ledge right here.

05:47.467 --> 05:49.767
You hook that up.

05:49.767 --> 05:51.867
[Carlos] That's about
the best you're gonna get.

05:51.867 --> 05:54.467
Whoa. That's deep.

05:54.467 --> 05:56.867
Uh, that's not
the best looking tree.

05:56.867 --> 06:00.000
But, hey, man, with that
drive into the [bleep] river.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.800

06:03.867 --> 06:05.367
Yeah.

06:07.667 --> 06:09.266
You get that. I'm good.

06:11.166 --> 06:12.767
[Dustin] Great, man.

06:12.767 --> 06:15.066
I don't encourage
this behavior.

06:15.066 --> 06:17.200
[laughing]

06:18.767 --> 06:20.700
[Dustin] How he doesn't die,
I don't know.

06:22.066 --> 06:24.767
This is all I have.
I don't have lumber.

06:24.767 --> 06:27.300
We're not going to get
any boards.

06:27.367 --> 06:30.000
It's either this or don't use
walkways at all.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.867
It's either this or don't use
walkways at all.

06:30.867 --> 06:31.000
And she wants a walkway,
so this is what she gets.

06:35.166 --> 06:39.000
Kayla's team is gonna have
some sort of way
to get to their site

06:39.000 --> 06:40.667
so they can get dredging.

06:40.667 --> 06:45.000
When both teams are dredging,
that means everybody's going
to get gold.

06:46.367 --> 06:47.867
[Carlos] Let's go down.

06:51.900 --> 06:53.100
[Scott] Hey, guys.

06:53.100 --> 06:54.667
-[Dustin] Here you go.
-[Scott] Thank you.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.166
Are y'all going to need
more trees or what?

06:58.166 --> 06:59.900
[Scott] [bleep]
I don't think so.

06:59.967 --> 07:00.000
[Dustin] All right, good luck.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
[Dustin] All right, good luck.

07:05.166 --> 07:06.900
I've done logging
for a lot of years,

07:06.967 --> 07:09.467
so milling the logs
into boards.

07:09.467 --> 07:11.066
It's home to me, so to speak.

07:11.066 --> 07:13.400
It's my little bit
of experience here

07:13.467 --> 07:15.300
can help us get
to the gold faster,

07:15.367 --> 07:17.500
absolutely.
I'm happy as hell to do it.

07:19.867 --> 07:21.166
Let's rock and roll, buddy.

07:21.166 --> 07:22.567
This is called
a chainsaw mill.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.000
It uses a regular chainsaw.

07:24.066 --> 07:27.100
And what it does is
it allows us to keep
the same thickness board

07:27.100 --> 07:29.867
as we rip down
the log the whole way.

07:29.867 --> 07:30.000
-[Scott] Ready?
-[Justin] Ready.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000

-[Justin] Ready.

2,700 to go.

07:45.367 --> 07:47.600
We're under
a major time crunch.

07:47.667 --> 07:50.000
We have a very short season
as it is.

07:50.066 --> 07:52.867
We can get these boards
milled quickly.

07:52.867 --> 07:54.467
That gets us to
site quicker.

07:54.467 --> 07:56.367
That makes access easier.

07:56.367 --> 07:58.300
That means more dive time,
which means more gold.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.667
[Scott] Beautiful.
Look at that.

08:11.367 --> 08:13.467
[Scott] We've got five more
planks already milled.

08:13.467 --> 08:15.300
Still got a lot to go.

08:15.367 --> 08:17.066
We're not even
halfway there yet, man.

08:18.166 --> 08:19.767

milled quick.

Rope broke.

10:05.066 --> 10:08.166
[Dustin] [bleep] it should
be up here right now.

10:08.166 --> 10:10.767

This is a learning curve.

10:10.767 --> 10:12.367
[Carlos] Pull, pull, pull.

10:14.166 --> 10:16.166
[Carlos] All stop.
All Stop.

10:16.166 --> 10:19.200
That rock fell
right on that rope.

10:19.266 --> 10:20.567
On that sharp side.

10:20.567 --> 10:23.100
The sharp side just
cut through like a knife.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.200
[Carlos] I'm just
getting frustrated.

10:25.266 --> 10:27.266
James, I'm getting frustrated.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Just got to take this
and re-thread it.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000

good stuff, but...

destroyed just like a cable.

[Carlos] We're gone, dude.

[Dustin] So I'm either having
a [bleep] heart attack

11:40.867 --> 11:42.266

11:42.266 --> 11:43.767

it's freaking me out.

[Carlos] What are you
feeling, man?

11:56.367 --> 11:58.166
[Dustin] Something's
happening, man.
I don't know.

11:58.166 --> 11:59.767
I have to go take some
aspirin or something.

11:59.767 --> 12:00.000
[Carlos] Okay.

[Dustin] Chest and neck
and [bleep] stuff.

It hurts like [bleep],
I can tell you that.

14:36.767 --> 14:38.367
It really is.

14:38.367 --> 14:41.400

an incredible amount of work.

14:41.467 --> 14:42.900
I'm still looking at it
every day.

14:42.967 --> 14:47.367
I look at it and go,
"Holy cow,
can we actually do this?"

14:47.367 --> 14:49.467
[Wes] You say an
incredible amount of work.
I think about that.

14:49.467 --> 14:52.567
But then there could be
an incredible amount of gold
to go along with that.

14:52.567 --> 14:54.567
-Exactly.
-That's what we're banking on.

14:54.567 --> 14:56.166

some soon.

-All right.
-All right.

15:19.767 --> 15:20.867
[Wes] Let's see
what's down there.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.100
Four boards.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.200
That should get us
around the corner at least.

to help out a lot.

15:42.700 --> 15:44.700
They weren't exactly easy.

15:44.767 --> 15:47.166

a bad-ass walkway.

15:51.567 --> 15:53.200
Hopefully,

15:53.266 --> 15:56.667
they can get in there
deep enough,
put a pipe in it

15:56.667 --> 15:58.467

everybody's weight.

-[laughs]

16:30.467 --> 16:31.000

and it's going to go pretty
quick now, I think.

16:33.967 --> 16:36.700
[Scott] That's bad-ass, dude.
I'm [bleep] happy with this.

16:49.767 --> 16:52.367
[Paul] For some reason,
I'm not getting any water
going to the drill head.

[narrator] <i>Without a constant</i>

[Paul] I got to have
that water pump to pump
water to the drill bit.

17:07.166 --> 17:10.667
It flushes out the material,
and it also keeps
the drill bit cool.

There's a few pumps around,
if I can get them working,

17:12.867 --> 17:14.667
then I'll get water
to the drill.

17:14.667 --> 17:18.166
Without it, I cannot drill
any more holes.

17:18.166 --> 17:19.567
I need a pump.

20:31.867 --> 20:33.400
[Wes] No. [bleep]

20:33.467 --> 20:35.166
[Carlos] If you just
can't get it up now.

20:35.166 --> 20:36.600
It's not moving, is it?

20:36.600 --> 20:40.166
[man 4] No, it's not moving,
and we're not getting
anything done.

20:45.800 --> 20:48.367
[Wes] You know, I think
that redirect is too low.

20:48.367 --> 20:49.867
If that was higher,
you know what,

20:49.867 --> 20:51.700
it would make them
skip over the top of this.

20:51.767 --> 20:54.767
But it's just pulling them
down into it
and locking it in.

20:56.467 --> 21:00.100
[narrator] <i>Wes believes</i>
<i>the position of the redirect</i>
<i>for the lower winch</i>

21:00.100 --> 21:00.120
<i>is dragging the boulders down</i>
<i>into the riverbed.</i>

21:00.120 --> 21:01.000
<i>is dragging the boulders down</i>
<i>into the riverbed.</i>

21:04.000 --> 21:09.500
<i>If they can raise it up by</i>
<i>25 feet, they can pull</i>
<i>the boulders up and out,</i>

21:09.567 --> 21:11.800
<i>clearing space</i>
<i>for the dredge.</i>

21:13.567 --> 21:15.000
[man 4] So we buried it.

21:16.567 --> 21:19.100
[Dustin] We're having
a real hard time
getting started here.

21:19.166 --> 21:22.700
It's taking forever,
and I need it to just work.

21:24.100 --> 21:26.700
We should have been
in the damn water diving
last week.

21:26.767 --> 21:30.120
And here we are fighting just
to get the damn dredge in.

21:30.120 --> 21:31.000
And here we are fighting just
to get the damn dredge in.

21:41.166 --> 21:42.867
[narrator]
<i>At the Golden Gates...</i>

21:44.967 --> 21:47.166
[Carlos groans]

21:47.166 --> 21:49.000
Where do you want
to put the ladder?

21:49.066 --> 21:50.667
[Dustin] Over here.

21:50.667 --> 21:53.467
[narrator] <i>...Dustin faces yet</i>
<i>another setback</i>

21:53.467 --> 21:57.166
<i>in his mission to get</i>
<i>the dredge to his dive site.</i>

21:57.166 --> 21:59.100
Our winch system
wasn't working.

21:59.100 --> 22:02.467
We've got to find
a viable rock
to put that redirect.

22:02.467 --> 22:06.200
You've got to remember,
all this surrounding rock
is junk.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.000
You've got to remember,
all this surrounding rock
is junk.

22:07.367 --> 22:10.467
So Dustin has to get
high enough

22:10.467 --> 22:13.266
to find a good spot
to put that redirect.

22:13.266 --> 22:16.100
[Dustin] The water here
is on a hard angle.

22:16.100 --> 22:17.567
So if we would have
done something like this

22:17.567 --> 22:20.100
at McKinley, it have worked
just fine.

22:20.100 --> 22:23.500
We have to go up there
to almost make it level.

22:23.567 --> 22:26.367
This is pulling the cable
into the ground.

22:26.367 --> 22:27.567
And that is unacceptable.

22:27.567 --> 22:29.800
We have to have
some sort of lift.

22:29.867 --> 22:32.200
[narrator] <i>The only way</i>
<i>to raise the redirect</i>

22:32.266 --> 22:36.200

<i>is to drill into</i>
<i>the thin section</i>

22:36.967 --> 22:37.000
[Dustin] That big black spot.

22:38.333 --> 22:40.166
[Carlos] Well, you see
how many layers you got
to go through

22:40.166 --> 22:41.467
before you hit solid?

22:41.467 --> 22:43.300
One, two, three, four.

22:44.800 --> 22:47.900
Hey, can you ask them
if they've got a helmet
I can borrow?

22:47.967 --> 22:49.100
This is sketch ball.

22:49.166 --> 22:51.400
[Carlos] Okay.
All right.

22:51.467 --> 22:56.166
[narrator] <i>In the shadow</i>
<i>of the 500-foot-high</i>

23:03.000 --> 23:05.266
I could play soldier
with you guys now.

23:20.467 --> 23:22.867
[man 4]
That's some scary [bleep].

23:22.867 --> 23:24.767
[Dustin] Right there?

23:24.767 --> 23:26.367
[Carlos] Yeah,
that looks good.

23:26.367 --> 23:28.767
[Dustin] I'm doing this
on a Hoping to Pray event.

23:45.800 --> 23:49.400
[Carlos] I know.
I couldn't do that.
[bleep] that.

23:56.567 --> 24:01.166
My worry about here
is the vibrations of this
pulling this whole flake off

24:01.166 --> 24:03.700
it would kill me instantly.

24:03.767 --> 24:06.200

[narrator] <i>...Dustin needs</i>
<i>two more anchor points</i>

24:15.467 --> 24:18.367
Come on, shoulder.
You can do this.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.000
[Carlos] Almost there, man.
Almost there.

24:31.066 --> 24:33.100
[Dustin] My hand's going numb.

24:33.100 --> 24:34.700
You can do this.

24:39.867 --> 24:43.967
That's it. I'm done.
[bleep] That was hard.

24:43.967 --> 24:46.700
[Carlos] Good job, man. Wow.

24:46.767 --> 24:49.767
[Dustin] Let me go
put these in right quick.

24:49.767 --> 24:52.567
[Carlos] So now that
we've got that taken
care of, he's going up,

24:52.567 --> 24:56.200
put in the anchor bolts,
and we're going to put
the hardware on chain.

24:56.266 --> 25:01.567
More cable.
Hopefully, that should
be the recipe for success.

25:11.867 --> 25:13.900
He's ready for a test.

25:13.967 --> 25:18.867
[Carlos] Okay, we got it.
Let's hook.

25:18.867 --> 25:24.367
This asteroid boulder
has been everybody's
pain in the behind.

25:24.367 --> 25:28.500
We need to get this out
of here and come in for
the win for today.

25:28.567 --> 25:30.667
[Dustin] Okay.
Let's see what it does.
I got it set.

25:30.667 --> 25:33.000
[James] Great.
Try to stick out, Carlos.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.467
[Carlos] Pull, pull, pull.

25:38.900 --> 25:40.567
It's moving.

25:40.567 --> 25:42.100
[whoops]

25:42.166 --> 25:44.166
-Yeah!
-[all whooping and exclaiming]

25:44.166 --> 25:46.000
[Wes] Look at that.

25:46.066 --> 25:48.000
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

25:50.000 --> 25:52.367
-[exclaims]
-There we go.

25:54.166 --> 25:55.467
Yeah, buddy.

25:58.467 --> 26:00.467
Finally getting
the winches to work.

26:01.600 --> 26:05.166
Please stay working,
please stay working.

26:05.166 --> 26:06.200
Come on, baby.

26:06.200 --> 26:06.800
Come on, baby.

26:06.867 --> 26:07.000
[Wes] We got more progress
in one day than
we have in two weeks.

26:10.066 --> 26:11.767
Finally, a great day.

26:12.900 --> 26:15.166
Hey, check that
balance job, boys.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.500
Goodbye. Goodbye.

26:19.567 --> 26:23.266
Goodbye. Goodbye.

-[all cheering]
-Goodbye.

26:25.567 --> 26:27.100
[Dustin]
Keep them coming, man.

26:27.100 --> 26:30.100
It's a damn good day.
It's a damn good day.

26:30.166 --> 26:33.467
We got a lot of rocks moved.
And this is what we do.

26:33.467 --> 26:35.567
This is dredge-worthy
right here.

26:35.567 --> 26:36.200
This is what I need.

26:36.200 --> 26:37.000
This is what I need.

26:37.367 --> 26:38.800
Good work today.

26:38.867 --> 26:40.467
It looks good.

26:40.467 --> 26:43.467
That's ready for a dredge.
I can see it.

26:43.467 --> 26:47.266
It actually looks like
a damn dredge site now.

26:47.266 --> 26:52.767
We're back on track.
Today is gonna be the change.
The change we needed.

27:04.567 --> 27:05.900
[Kayla] <i>I need some breakfast.</i>

27:05.967 --> 27:06.200
-[Dustin] <i>Right.</i>
-[Kayla] <i>I'm hungry.</i>

27:06.200 --> 27:07.000
-[Dustin] <i>Right.</i>
-[Kayla] <i>I'm hungry.</i>

27:08.066 --> 27:10.100
-[Dustin] Where's
the bacon and eggs?
-[Kayla] Mm-hmm.

27:10.100 --> 27:11.667
[Dustin] Where's
the breakfast burritos?

27:11.667 --> 27:13.500
[Carlos] Oh, God. Oh, gosh.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.100
Stretching out my back.

27:17.867 --> 27:20.200
I'm not
a young person anymore.

27:20.266 --> 27:25.867
That's from
all the rock moving,
gear moving.

27:25.867 --> 27:30.667
Unfortunately,
the chiropractor
won't come up this far.

27:30.667 --> 27:33.567
[Wes] All right,
time to get back to work.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.567
[narrator] <i>Up creek</i>
<i>at the boardwalk...</i>

Please don't break.
Oh, good girl.
You didn't break.

[narrator]
<i>...Paul and Scott have</i>
<i>their dive site within reach.</i>

27:55.300 --> 27:58.467
We finally got a good path
now that gets us
all the way over here.

27:58.467 --> 28:00.867
I think we can start carrying
a lot of our heavy stuff in.

28:00.867 --> 28:02.367
[Kayla] That looks awesome.

28:02.367 --> 28:04.667
It's way sturdier
than I expected.

28:04.667 --> 28:06.200
[Kayla] You guys did good.

28:06.200 --> 28:06.367
[Kayla] You guys did good.

28:06.367 --> 28:07.000
[Scott] No more
walking through the water.

28:08.767 --> 28:10.266
[Kayla] Heck, yeah.

28:10.266 --> 28:12.667
Well, I have a list of stuff
that we need to gather up,

28:12.667 --> 28:15.567
and then Paul and I can
take the dredge up here.

28:15.567 --> 28:19.100
Once we get that done,
we're ready to start
putting a dredge in the water.

28:19.100 --> 28:21.300
-[Scott] Okay.
-[Paul] Sweet. Let's do it.

28:23.867 --> 28:26.567
[Paul] I'll definitely be
glad when we're done carrying
the dredge over there.

28:26.567 --> 28:28.567
-[Kayla] Yeah.
-[Paul] This was
a pain in the ass.

28:28.567 --> 28:30.300
[Kayla] It really is.

28:30.367 --> 28:32.700
[Paul] If we could only
have a helicopter fly it in.

28:32.767 --> 28:33.867
[Kayla chuckles]

28:33.867 --> 28:35.367
[Kayla]
You've got to find gold first.

28:38.166 --> 28:41.667
Because we're so behind
in the season,
having relocated,

28:41.667 --> 28:43.400
it's been
really hard on everyone.

28:43.467 --> 28:45.600
We don't really have
any gold to show for it.

28:45.667 --> 28:49.967
So we're in a mad dash to get
in the water to get dredging.

28:49.967 --> 28:51.600
The last piece
of the dredge.

28:51.667 --> 28:53.100
[Paul] [bleep].

28:53.100 --> 28:54.867
[Kayla] All right.

28:54.867 --> 28:58.367
That's good for now.
I'm gonna take a break.

28:58.367 --> 28:59.567
Oh, man.

29:01.266 --> 29:03.066
We got it.

29:03.066 --> 29:04.667
[Kayla] You want to start
moving the dredge?

29:04.667 --> 29:06.200
I think we have enough
water to float it now.

29:06.200 --> 29:06.667
I think we have enough
water to float it now.

29:06.667 --> 29:07.000
[Paul] We can do that.

<i>of pounds of dredge parts</i>
<i>hauled and assembled,</i>

29:19.667 --> 29:21.467
[Kayla] We're so close.

29:21.467 --> 29:24.000
It's a huge relief
to get the dredge floating.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.600
Get it in the water.
We're about to fire it up.

29:26.667 --> 29:28.367
And that's going to be
a huge moment for us

29:28.367 --> 29:33.266
because it's been
such a pain in the ass
to get access.

29:33.266 --> 29:36.200
-Let's fire this thing up.
There it goes.
-[engine rumbling]

29:43.767 --> 29:47.300
[Paul] [bleep] Hey.
We got it.

29:47.367 --> 29:49.400
[Kayla] Heck, yeah.

29:49.467 --> 29:51.867
We've got a dredge running.

29:51.867 --> 29:54.000
I'm gonna go put
some material through it.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.266
[Paul] [bleep] yeah.

29:55.266 --> 29:56.800

[Paul] I see rocks going
over the box.
We're actually dredging.

30:06.200 --> 30:07.000
Is there material coming out?

30:07.867 --> 30:10.667
[Paul] Yeah, it's coming out.
They're going
right over the dam.

30:10.667 --> 30:12.900
It's perfect.

30:12.967 --> 30:14.467
[Paul laughing]

30:17.266 --> 30:19.266
We have faced
a lot of challenges.

30:19.266 --> 30:22.567
So today was a really huge
accomplishment to get
a dredge in the water.

30:22.567 --> 30:24.900
Dustin's crew had
a little bit of a head start.

30:24.967 --> 30:29.000
Even with their head start,
my crew still got our dredge
in the water first,

30:29.000 --> 30:31.867
so now we can do what
we actually came here to do,

30:31.867 --> 30:33.467
which is hopefully
find some gold.

30:40.767 --> 30:42.400
[Dustin] <i>We're going over</i>
<i>the big boulders.</i>

30:42.467 --> 30:46.266

<i>It's not going to be easy.</i>

<i>After five weeks of delays,</i>

30:48.667 --> 30:52.200
<i>Dustin has one large obstacle</i>
<i>standing between him</i>

30:52.266 --> 30:54.867
<i>and a potentially</i>
<i>monstrous payday.</i>

30:54.867 --> 30:58.200
[Dustin] We are dragging
this dredge up the creek.

30:58.266 --> 31:00.600
For better or worse,
we're doing it.

31:00.667 --> 31:04.467
This is a big machine.
We could have taken
it apart piece by piece

31:04.467 --> 31:05.960
and tried to put
it together out there.

31:05.960 --> 31:06.000
and tried to put
it together out there.

31:06.166 --> 31:08.200
But it would have taken
us a long damn time.

31:09.700 --> 31:12.567
[Dustin] Hey Wes.
I'm worried about these
pontoons right now.

31:12.567 --> 31:14.767
If we drag it up,
we're probably
going to pop them.

31:14.767 --> 31:18.166
So, you know, those guys
made their walkways with
those other boards.

31:18.166 --> 31:20.567
We've got these two
that they're not going
to use for anything.

31:20.567 --> 31:22.266
If we put these under here

31:22.266 --> 31:25.867
so it's kind of got a sled,
we can just pull it over
there with the ATV, I think.

31:25.867 --> 31:27.400
[Dustin] Like on the boards?

31:27.400 --> 31:30.400
Yeah, because those
are tough compared to
the bottom of our pontoons.

31:30.467 --> 31:33.266
If we ruin our pontoons,
we're gonna be screwed.

31:33.266 --> 31:35.960
[Dustin] Hopefully we
can drag this thing up
the creek without it

31:35.960 --> 31:36.000
[Dustin] Hopefully we
can drag this thing up
the creek without it

31:36.467 --> 31:38.800
just completely
devastating itself.

31:38.867 --> 31:41.767
This thing needs to be
in place and ready to go.

31:43.367 --> 31:47.200
[narrator] <i>The plan?</i>
<i>Build a sled from</i>
<i>the cottonwood boards</i>

31:47.266 --> 31:49.967
<i>strong enough to carry</i>
<i>the heavy weight dredge,</i>

31:49.967 --> 31:53.400
<i>then haul it</i>
<i>1000 feet from camp</i>

31:53.467 --> 31:59.200
<i>up an uneven dirt track</i>
<i>to the access point</i>
<i>on Nugget Creek.</i>

31:59.266 --> 32:03.667
<i>From here, they will take</i>

<i>section of the journey,</i>

32:03.667 --> 32:05.960

<i>one-ton dredge</i>

32:05.960 --> 32:06.000
<i>dragging the nearly</i>
<i>one-ton dredge</i>

32:06.367 --> 32:09.667
<i>through a series of bends</i>
<i>500-feet</i>

32:09.667 --> 32:12.900
<i>up the raging,</i>
<i>boulder-infested creek</i>

32:12.967 --> 32:15.300
<i>all the way</i>
<i>to their dive site.</i>

32:17.266 --> 32:21.166
[Wes] We've got a little
trailer that we've always
used for a fuel trailer.

32:21.166 --> 32:23.900
We're going to try to
rig that underneath
these as well,

32:23.967 --> 32:27.800
so we can have us
a makeshift trailer.
It'll work.

32:27.867 --> 32:30.200
[Carlos] It has to work.
It gots to work.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.367
[Dustin] Rock and roll.

32:34.367 --> 32:35.960
[Wes] Watch the float,
don't get caught.

32:35.960 --> 32:36.000
[Wes] Watch the float,
don't get caught.

32:36.100 --> 32:37.367
[Carlos] Oh, sweet.

32:38.967 --> 32:40.266
[Dustin] [bleep]
Let's jack this up.

32:40.266 --> 32:42.767
[Carlos] We need to have it
way up, huh?

32:42.767 --> 32:46.767
[Dustin] Just watch it.
Stop. One click at a time.

32:46.767 --> 32:48.800
[Carlos] One click at a time.
Got you.

32:49.967 --> 32:52.367
-[grunts, exclaims]
-[Dustin] Or just do that.

32:52.367 --> 32:53.800
-Or just drop it.
-[chuckles]

32:53.867 --> 32:55.667
[Dustin] I'm not sure
if it'll work or not.

32:55.667 --> 32:58.667
[Wes] Yeah,
it's got so much
potential for disaster.

32:58.667 --> 33:00.400
[Dustin] I think
we're ready to go, y'all.

33:05.266 --> 33:05.960
That works.

33:05.960 --> 33:06.000
That works.

33:08.867 --> 33:10.367
Looks like it's working.

33:13.266 --> 33:15.767
-Oh. Oh-oh.
-[laughs] [bleep]

33:15.767 --> 33:17.467
[James] That's a bumpy ride.

33:17.467 --> 33:19.166
It's getting more
bumpier here.

33:19.166 --> 33:20.667
[Wes] Ooh, is it gonna make it
up the hill?

33:20.667 --> 33:22.600
[Carlos] This is where
it's gonna get tricky, dude.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.567
You've got to give it
some gas.

33:27.100 --> 33:28.667
-Four wheel drive?
-[Wes] Oh, God. No.

33:30.667 --> 33:32.100
[bleep]

33:36.767 --> 33:37.767
[Dustin] Wow.

33:40.100 --> 33:41.600
Nada.

33:41.667 --> 33:44.867
It got stuck.
Little too steep.

33:46.500 --> 33:49.967
What the [bleep] man?
Is it that heavy?

33:49.967 --> 33:51.567
Let me go get the Mini Ex.

33:53.100 --> 33:55.000
We're getting into an area
that is so steep right now

33:55.066 --> 33:57.166
and there's so much gravel
that the ATV is just slipping.

33:59.367 --> 34:03.266
[Dustin]
Mini Ex to the rescue.

34:03.266 --> 34:05.266
Strike Team Mini Ex.

34:08.867 --> 34:11.066
Just give it pressure.
I'll do the rest.

34:29.367 --> 34:31.000
[Wes] Look at that.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.100
[man 5]
I can't believe it's working.

34:35.166 --> 34:35.960
[Wes] Yeah,
but this is the easy part.

34:35.960 --> 34:36.000
[Wes] Yeah,
but this is the easy part.

34:37.867 --> 34:39.166
[Dustin laughing]

34:39.166 --> 34:40.767
[Dustin] <i>We made it</i>
<i>to Nugget Creek.</i>

34:42.800 --> 34:44.867
[Wes] This is going to be
a [bleep] nightmare.

34:46.567 --> 34:48.000
Just wait till you go look
at the creek, though.

34:48.066 --> 34:50.166
The water's down.
It's just nothing
but a boulder field.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.767
[Wes] Holy, [bleep].

34:56.266 --> 35:00.567
[narrator] <i>Now they must</i>

[Dustin] <i>Hey, James.</i>
<i>You got me?</i>

35:07.166 --> 35:08.433
[James] Yeah.

35:08.433 --> 35:10.567
[Dustin]
Before you make it to us
there's a big boulder

35:10.567 --> 35:13.467
I'd like you to attach
that redirect on.

35:13.467 --> 35:17.200
[narrator] <i>The series</i>

35:21.667 --> 35:23.300
I don't know
how this is going to work.

35:23.300 --> 35:26.166
Once this gets in, I don't
think it's gonna have
the power to take it up, dude.

35:26.166 --> 35:27.667
I guarantee it.

35:27.667 --> 35:29.767
I don't need that right now.

35:29.767 --> 35:31.266
[Carlos] Just telling you man.

35:31.266 --> 35:33.667
I'm just saying.
I don't need that right now.

35:33.667 --> 35:35.960
Let's fail before you
tell me it's not going
to work. All right?

35:35.960 --> 35:36.000
Let's fail before you
tell me it's not going
to work. All right?

35:36.867 --> 35:38.166
Okay.

35:40.667 --> 35:43.100
[Dustin] All right, Wes,
let's see if we can move it.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.066
It's coming.

35:48.066 --> 35:50.467
[James] Holy, [bleep].

35:59.867 --> 36:02.767
[Dustin] Oh,
it's pulling that big boulder.

36:02.767 --> 36:04.900
[Carlos] All stop.
All stop, all stop.

36:04.967 --> 36:05.960
That boulder is being pulled,
man, for a redirect.

Pull. We'll see what happens.

36:21.200 --> 36:22.900
[Carlos] It's a war.

36:22.967 --> 36:24.100
[Dustin] It's going.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.100
It's not gonna make that turn,
is it?

36:28.166 --> 36:29.400
[James] No.

36:29.467 --> 36:31.700
That boulder moved too much?

36:31.767 --> 36:34.100
[Carlos] It's bringing it
right here through all this.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.300
[Dustin] Keep going.
We're about to run
into something bigs.

36:38.367 --> 36:39.367
Stand by.

36:40.900 --> 36:43.200
I don't know if this
is going to work.

36:43.266 --> 36:44.867

how to drive it.

36:44.867 --> 36:46.266
[Carlos] Oh, okay.

36:46.266 --> 36:47.600
All right, let's get a pull.

[Dustin] Holy, [bleep].

36:56.166 --> 36:57.367
[Carlos] Holy, [bleep].

36:57.367 --> 37:00.166
-[Dustin] Wow.
-It's actually
driving up the rocks.

37:02.166 --> 37:03.500
-[James] Look at that.
-[Carlos] What?

37:05.200 --> 37:05.960
-No freakin' way.
-[James] No way, dude.

-[James] No way, dude.

37:14.166 --> 37:15.500
[Dustin] All right, Wes.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.066
We're going to do
some heavy off-roading.

37:17.066 --> 37:19.400
We have to go
around a really big rock.

37:19.467 --> 37:20.767
[Wes] Copy that.
Are you ready to go?

37:20.767 --> 37:22.100
Pull.

37:26.767 --> 37:29.000
[Dustin] <i>All stop,</i>
<i>all stop, all stop.</i>

37:29.000 --> 37:31.867

37:31.867 --> 37:33.200
Copy that.

37:35.066 --> 37:35.960
Unfortunately, this route
has taken us up

37:35.960 --> 37:36.000
Unfortunately, this route
has taken us up

37:38.266 --> 37:40.600
straight on this
Boulder field.

37:40.667 --> 37:42.166
[exclaims in exasperation]

37:43.967 --> 37:46.400
I'm stuck.
I don't know what to do.

37:52.200 --> 37:54.100
[Dustin] It's not going to
make it over that rock.

37:56.166 --> 37:57.567

-Hey, Dave.
-[Dave] Yeah.

38:26.900 --> 38:30.567
It's stuck on that
second-to-last board back
there on that big hump.

38:30.567 --> 38:33.480
We've got to lift
the very back left corner.

38:33.480 --> 38:34.000
We've got to lift
the very back left corner.

38:34.367 --> 38:35.800
[Carlos] Oh. [bleep]

38:35.867 --> 38:37.767
-[Dustin] It's up there, huh?
-[Carlos] It's up there, man.

38:37.767 --> 38:40.166
[Dustin] Can you get
the back up with a crow bar,
do you think?

38:40.166 --> 38:42.600
You got to come up a lot.

38:44.500 --> 38:45.967
Okay. Now give it a pull.

38:45.967 --> 38:47.166
[Carlos] Ready?

38:48.767 --> 38:52.266
[Dustin] It's got to be
two blocks. I can't move it.

38:52.266 --> 38:55.266

39:03.480 --> 39:04.000
[James] Hey.
Do you want me to
go grab that, Jack?

39:04.266 --> 39:07.400
[Dustin] Yeah.
Anything at this point.

39:08.667 --> 39:11.367
[narrator] <i>Caught between</i>
<i>a rock in a hard place,</i>

39:11.367 --> 39:17.667

39:17.667 --> 39:21.600
[Dustin] Thank you, James.
It's never gonna work.

39:21.667 --> 39:23.367
[James] It's pretty sketchy.

39:23.367 --> 39:25.166
[Dustin]
That is super sketchy.

39:26.266 --> 39:28.800
-[James on radio] Copy, Wes?
-[Wes on radio] Yep.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.667
[Wes] Woah. Copy that.

39:37.400 --> 39:41.200
[Dustin] Yeah.
Come on, [bleep].

39:41.266 --> 39:44.266
Keep on going Wes.
Keep on going.
Pull, pull, pull.

39:46.266 --> 39:48.467
[James] Oh, yeah.

39:48.467 --> 39:49.767
[Dustin] It's over it.

39:49.767 --> 39:52.000
[guffawing]

39:56.266 --> 39:58.100
[James] [bleep]
We just went over that.

39:58.166 --> 39:59.500
[Wes] That's working, though.

39:59.567 --> 40:01.100
[Carlos] It's working, man.

40:01.100 --> 40:03.480
Pretty soon, I'm going
to see the dredge start
coming around the corner,

40:03.480 --> 40:04.000
Pretty soon, I'm going
to see the dredge start
coming around the corner,

40:04.967 --> 40:07.266

on our home stretch.

40:08.467 --> 40:10.066
Stop, I see the dredge.

40:10.500 --> 40:11.600
[laughs]

40:16.100 --> 40:19.867
Oh, this is actually working.
It wasn't easy.

40:21.500 --> 40:23.300
Come on, baby.

40:23.367 --> 40:24.400
Come on, baby.

40:28.467 --> 40:32.467
[Dustin] Can you believe it?
Good job.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.166
One more leap.

40:38.166 --> 40:41.667
Now we have
a huge pile of boulders

40:41.667 --> 40:44.600
about 100 feet long,
and, well,

40:46.500 --> 40:49.767
this thing's been
put to the test.

40:49.767 --> 40:51.300
Nothing this bad.

[Wes]
<i>This is only a single pull.</i>

40:53.367 --> 40:55.867
<i>I don't know if</i>

40:55.867 --> 40:58.200
[Dustin] All right,
let's see what you got.

40:58.266 --> 41:00.066
Are you ready to
break some stuff?

[narrator] <i>Up creek</i>
<i>at Kayla's site...</i>

so if we find gold,
that would be great.

41:19.166 --> 41:22.367

but we're always hopeful.

[narrator] <i>Unlike at McKinley,</i>

gold in that box.

running material.

back in the water.

43:37.767 --> 43:41.100
We got a lot of rock moved.
We got a good area opened up.

43:41.100 --> 43:44.767
I feel like things are
going to start getting
into a better rhythm now.

43:44.767 --> 43:48.166
If we can do what we actually
came here to do, which is
hopefully find some gold.

43:54.400 --> 43:56.266
[narrator] <i>Down creek,</i>

43:56.266 --> 43:59.266
<i>A hundred feet of boulders</i>
<i>stands between Dustin</i>

43:59.266 --> 44:02.767
<i>and the official start</i>
<i>to his mining season.</i>

44:02.767 --> 44:08.867
Last obstacle getting
our dredge up this
massive pile of rocks.

44:08.867 --> 44:12.767
[narrator]
<i>For a job this size,</i>
<i>it's all hands on deck.</i>

44:12.767 --> 44:16.767
<i>So Dustin has called in Scott</i>
<i>and Paul for extra muscle.</i>

44:16.767 --> 44:19.100
[Dustin] We're about
ready to fire up. Let's go.

44:33.100 --> 44:35.867
[Dustin] Uh... All stop.

44:35.867 --> 44:37.367
All stop. All stop.

44:37.367 --> 44:39.100
There's a big boulder
in our damn way.

44:39.166 --> 44:41.667
There's actually a lot of
big boulders in our way.

44:41.667 --> 44:44.100
[Wes] Is it trying up there?

44:44.100 --> 44:47.300
It's barely clicking, man,
it's trying, but it ain't
doing nothing.

44:47.367 --> 44:49.400
[Carlos] Maybe we should lose
the trailer from here on out.

44:51.500 --> 44:52.000
[Dustin] Nobody
likes a quitter, Carlos.

44:53.767 --> 44:55.400
[Carlos cackles]

44:56.400 --> 44:58.300
All we got to do
is double pull on this.

44:58.367 --> 45:00.867
We're trying to move
the dredge up
the hardest part right now.

45:00.867 --> 45:03.767
And this winch with just
a single pull is not enough.

45:03.767 --> 45:06.500
They're going to have
to find a way to do
a double pull on it.

45:06.567 --> 45:09.867
This is going to help out
the winch. Double pull.

45:11.066 --> 45:12.800
[James] Hey, Carlos,
careful on that.

45:12.867 --> 45:14.066
It slipped out
on me just now.

45:14.066 --> 45:15.367
[Carlos] Okay. Copy that.

45:17.166 --> 45:19.000
Whoa!

45:20.266 --> 45:21.160
-You mean like that?
-[James] Yep.

45:21.160 --> 45:21.667
-You mean like that?
-[James] Yep.

45:21.667 --> 45:22.000
[Carlos] Okay. Thank you.

45:30.066 --> 45:33.266
[Scott]
We're ready to roll up here?
That winch is running.

45:33.266 --> 45:35.166
[Dustin]
Wes, you're with them?

45:35.166 --> 45:36.400
Yep.

45:36.467 --> 45:38.000
[Dustin] Pull.

45:42.867 --> 45:44.166
Got it.

45:48.500 --> 45:51.160
[Carlos] Yeah.
It's freaking believable.

45:51.160 --> 45:52.000
[Carlos] Yeah.
It's freaking believable.

45:53.767 --> 45:55.166
[Paul] Look at that thing man.

45:55.166 --> 45:57.166
Come on in,
climb over the wall in.

45:57.166 --> 45:58.567
[Carlos] Holy crap.

45:58.567 --> 45:59.767
[Paul]
It's plowing the boulder.

45:59.767 --> 46:01.066
[James] All the way up.

46:01.066 --> 46:02.467
[Carlos laughing]

46:07.266 --> 46:09.300
[Dustin] Come on.
Come on, baby.

46:12.900 --> 46:16.000
[James] Yeah. Yeah.

46:16.066 --> 46:21.100
[Dustin] Yes, yes. Yeah! Oh.
That's what I'm talking about.

46:22.467 --> 46:23.567
Perfect.

46:23.567 --> 46:25.266
[Paul] Look at that.

46:25.266 --> 46:27.100
[Dustin] Congratulations.

46:27.166 --> 46:29.567
[Carlos] [bleep] yeah.

46:29.567 --> 46:36.166
[Dustin] We just dragged
a dredge up by a huge
whitewater, steep creek, man.

46:36.166 --> 46:39.867
This is a perfect spot.
Get her
off of our little trailer.

46:39.867 --> 46:43.100
That was awesome, guys.
Good job.

46:43.166 --> 46:46.000
That was a lot of effort, but,
man, I'm glad we did it.

46:48.467 --> 46:50.567
Hey, buddy.
Good job, man.

46:50.567 --> 46:51.160
[Carlos]
That was a miracle, dude.

46:51.160 --> 46:52.000
[Carlos]
That was a miracle, dude.

46:53.166 --> 46:59.000
Thank you for letting me work
here, man. I would've never
thought that worked at all.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.567
That is so cool to see
the dredge sitting there.

47:03.400 --> 47:08.166
I can't believe that worked.
Good job, everybody. Let's
do it again tomorrow.

47:08.166 --> 47:10.700
[Scott] Yeah.

47:10.767 --> 47:14.200
It was one hell of an
adventure. Nobody thought
it was gonna work.

47:14.266 --> 47:17.000
I had my doubts.
We got it done.

47:20.367 --> 47:21.160
It's a wild damn feeling
to just go after something

47:21.160 --> 47:22.000
It's a wild damn feeling
to just go after something

47:23.967 --> 47:26.200
knowing you're
probably going to fail

47:26.266 --> 47:31.100
and then completing it.
My dredge is in place.
It's time to go diving.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.300
[Dustin] Gotta die,
might as well die having fun.

47:38.367 --> 47:41.400
[narrator] <i>Next time on</i>
Gold Rush: White Water <i>.</i>

47:41.467 --> 47:44.066
[Dustin] Whoa!
Look out! [bleep] Stephen.

47:45.600 --> 47:47.000
[Kayla] Be careful.

47:47.066 --> 47:48.867
Are you stuck right now?

47:48.867 --> 47:50.100
[Justin] That got my leg.

47:50.100 --> 47:51.160
-Ow.
-Good to go.

47:51.160 --> 47:52.000
-Ow.
-Good to go.

47:52.567 --> 47:55.400
[Dustin] <i>Hopefully it</i>
<i>gets down to some gold.</i>
<i>We need this bad.</i>

47:55.467 --> 47:56.867
More than they know.
