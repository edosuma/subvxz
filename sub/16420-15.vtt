08:32.041 --> 08:34.291
You first need to learn

08:32.041 --> 08:34.291
on this rental helicopter.

08:34.333 --> 08:36.041
- Okay, fine, whatever,

08:36.083 --> 08:37.917
let's just start this thing,

08:36.083 --> 08:37.917
okay, I just wanna fly.

08:37.959 --> 08:39.333
- Hey hey hey...

08:37.959 --> 08:39.333
it's not that easy.

08:39.375 --> 08:41.750
- Oh it's not?

08:39.375 --> 08:41.750
- No, it's not.

08:41.792 --> 08:43.625
I mean, for example...

08:41.792 --> 08:43.625
starting a helicopter...

08:43.667 --> 08:45.542
nothing at all

08:43.667 --> 08:45.542
like starting a car.

08:45.583 --> 08:47.458
As you can see,

08:45.583 --> 08:47.458
there are literally dozens

08:47.500 --> 08:50.125
of buttons, levers and lights

08:47.500 --> 08:50.125
all over the dashboard,

08:50.166 --> 08:52.959
and it takes time

08:50.166 --> 08:52.959
and experience...

08:59.000 --> 09:00.709
Don't do that.

09:00.750 --> 09:03.166
- But it started.

09:00.750 --> 09:03.166
- I know but don't do that.

09:03.208 --> 09:04.500
- Okay.

09:03.208 --> 09:04.500
- Thank you.

09:05.750 --> 09:06.709
- But it started.

09:06.750 --> 09:08.625
- What?

09:06.750 --> 09:08.625
- Mmm??? What?

09:12.542 --> 09:14.375
- Who started the helicopter!?

09:14.417 --> 09:15.667
- Uhhh...

09:14.417 --> 09:15.667
- Henry did.

09:15.709 --> 09:17.166
- Well, we're not really sure--

09:17.208 --> 09:18.583
- We're very sure, it was Henry.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.583
- Well...

09:18.625 --> 09:20.583
- Henry, did you start

09:18.625 --> 09:20.583
the helicopter?

09:20.625 --> 09:22.125
- Uh. Maybe!

09:20.625 --> 09:22.125
I think so!

09:22.166 --> 09:23.875
I'm pretty sure yeah!

09:22.166 --> 09:23.875
Why does it matter?

09:23.917 --> 09:25.291
I didn't mean to!

09:23.917 --> 09:25.291
I'm sorry.

09:25.333 --> 09:29.041
- Well, the next time you

09:25.333 --> 09:29.041
wanna start a helicopter,

09:29.083 --> 09:31.667
I'd appreciate it

09:29.083 --> 09:31.667
if you'd please tell me,

09:31.709 --> 09:34.583
so I can move my head away

09:31.709 --> 09:34.583
from the large spinning blades!

09:34.625 --> 09:36.000
- Dude, she's mad,

09:34.625 --> 09:36.000
so just take off.

09:36.041 --> 09:38.375
- Just hit the thing

09:36.041 --> 09:38.375
and lift off.

09:38.417 --> 09:41.375
- Wait! Hold on!

09:38.417 --> 09:41.375
- Here we go!

09:41.417 --> 09:42.750
- Flying away?

09:41.417 --> 09:42.750
You're flying away?!?

09:42.792 --> 09:44.041
Wait, hold on...

09:44.083 --> 09:46.875
- Oh, no, bye!

09:44.083 --> 09:46.875
- Byeee!

09:46.917 --> 09:48.875
- I was in the middle of

09:46.917 --> 09:48.875
expressing my thoughts!

09:48.917 --> 09:50.792
Wait, hold on!

09:48.917 --> 09:50.792
Don't you lift off!

09:50.834 --> 09:54.000
- Ohh, can't hear you!

09:50.834 --> 09:54.000
- Oh, it's really loud.

09:54.041 --> 09:57.792
- Like wow, really loud.

09:54.041 --> 09:57.792
- Because of the blades...

09:57.834 --> 09:59.959
- Dont go without me!

09:57.834 --> 09:59.959
Come back!

10:00.000 --> 10:01.208
- We can't come back!

10:01.250 --> 10:03.709
- We don't know how it works!

10:03.750 --> 10:05.750
- You do too

10:03.750 --> 10:05.750
know how it works!!!

10:05.792 --> 10:07.709
- Back in a few!

10:13.458 --> 10:15.125
- Now, as you can see,

10:15.166 --> 10:18.667
one of the most important things

10:15.166 --> 10:18.667
about flying a helicopter

10:18.709 --> 10:23.166
is keeping the helicopter

10:18.709 --> 10:23.166
high off the ground,

10:23.208 --> 10:24.667
or, in more technical terms,

10:24.709 --> 10:27.041
- Dude! Dude!

10:24.709 --> 10:27.041
- Air--

10:27.083 --> 10:28.959
- You said I could fly!

10:29.000 --> 10:31.375
- Well yeah but first,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.375
I gotta teach you!

10:31.417 --> 10:34.667
- Then teach me

10:31.417 --> 10:34.667
while I'm flying!

10:34.709 --> 10:37.291
- Aaaahhh...all right,

10:37.333 --> 10:38.542
you think you're ready

10:37.333 --> 10:38.542
to fly this thing?

10:38.583 --> 10:40.125
- Yeah, I really do!

10:40.166 --> 10:42.500
- All right,

10:40.166 --> 10:42.500
let's switch places.

10:43.667 --> 10:45.125
- Okay!

10:43.667 --> 10:45.125
- Yeah you coming to me?

10:45.166 --> 10:46.875
- Okay, yeah yeah yeah...

10:45.166 --> 10:46.875
- Come over here.

10:46.917 --> 10:48.917
- Counter-clockwise...

10:46.917 --> 10:48.917
- What, no, I go--

10:48.959 --> 10:50.417
- Counter-clockwise...

10:48.959 --> 10:50.417
- You go clockwise--

10:50.458 --> 10:53.333
- I go counter-clockwise!

10:50.458 --> 10:53.333
- All right, all right...

10:53.375 --> 10:54.834
- Watch the banana!

10:53.375 --> 10:54.834
- Whoah, whoah!

10:54.875 --> 10:57.291
- You take the banana!

10:54.875 --> 10:57.291
- I got the banana...

10:57.333 --> 11:00.041
You get the stick. Got it?

10:57.333 --> 11:00.041
- All right, all right...

11:00.083 --> 11:01.709
- No, no, no!

11:00.083 --> 11:01.709
- You got it, you got it!

11:01.750 --> 11:04.667
- All right!

11:01.750 --> 11:04.667
- Ahhh! Oh!

11:04.709 --> 11:08.583
- Aww gosh!

11:04.709 --> 11:08.583
There goes my banana.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Woo! Hahaha!

11:18.041 --> 11:21.583
Yeah! Woo!

11:18.041 --> 11:21.583
This isn't so hard!

11:21.625 --> 11:23.083
- Yeah, just be careful.

11:23.125 --> 11:25.417
- Yeah, no prob--

11:23.125 --> 11:25.417
Hey, that's my soda!

11:25.458 --> 11:28.000
- Yeah, well, I'm drinkin' it.

11:25.458 --> 11:28.000
- No no, you better not!

11:28.041 --> 11:30.208
- Don't tell me what I can

11:28.041 --> 11:30.208
and cannot drink, Henry--

11:30.250 --> 11:32.291
Whoah--no!

11:32.333 --> 11:33.959
Dang it!

11:38.166 --> 11:42.041
- Schwoz...

11:38.166 --> 11:42.041
just come pick me up!

11:42.083 --> 11:45.000
Because Ray

11:42.083 --> 11:45.000
and Henry left me here

11:45.041 --> 11:47.709
and I don't know when they're...

11:47.750 --> 11:48.959
Soda!!!

11:53.959 --> 11:57.583
- HEY! IT'S NOT COOL

11:53.959 --> 11:57.583
TO DROP SODA BOTTLES FROM TH--

11:57.625 --> 11:59.542
D'ah, they can't hear me.

12:11.291 --> 12:14.875
- Mmmmm, look at

12:11.291 --> 12:14.875
all that cotton candy.

12:14.917 --> 12:17.875
I'm gonna eat

12:14.917 --> 12:17.875
that cotton candy.

12:17.917 --> 12:19.291
- Well be careful,

12:19.333 --> 12:21.375
you don't wanna eat

12:19.333 --> 12:21.375
too much sugar.

12:21.417 --> 12:24.917
- Haha, there's not that much

12:21.417 --> 12:24.917
sugar in cotton candy.

12:26.750 --> 12:28.083
- Yeah there is.

12:28.125 --> 12:31.250
- Okay, what's your

12:28.125 --> 12:31.250
shirt made of?

12:31.291 --> 12:32.917
- Cotton.

12:32.959 --> 12:34.542
- And is there any sugar

12:32.959 --> 12:34.542
in your shirt?

12:34.583 --> 12:38.041
- Wh...Well, no.

12:38.083 --> 12:40.291
- Then what are you

12:38.083 --> 12:40.291
talking about?!?

12:40.333 --> 12:42.542
- Nothing. All right?

12:40.333 --> 12:42.542
Now, just gimme my backpack.

12:42.583 --> 12:44.291
- Sure, just gimme 10 bucks.

12:44.333 --> 12:47.375
- No no no no no,

12:44.333 --> 12:47.375
we made a deal, all right,

12:47.417 --> 12:49.417
you give me my backpack

12:47.417 --> 12:49.417
for the cotton candy machine.

12:49.458 --> 12:51.792
- Now it's 20 for arguing.

12:51.834 --> 12:54.250
- It's not fair

12:51.834 --> 12:54.250
to change the deal!

12:54.291 --> 12:57.625
- I need twenty bucks

12:54.291 --> 12:57.625
AND the cotton candy machine

12:57.667 --> 12:59.375
or else you d--

12:57.667 --> 12:59.375
- Ahhhhhh!!!

13:00.709 --> 13:02.792
- Whooaa, awesome!

13:02.834 --> 13:05.709
- No! It's not awesome,

13:02.834 --> 13:05.709
the machine's gone crazy!

13:05.750 --> 13:08.333
- So turn off the machine.

13:14.542 --> 13:16.250
[ grunting ]

13:17.834 --> 13:19.333
- Aw! No-no!

13:19.375 --> 13:20.625
The lever broke!

13:19.375 --> 13:20.625
I can't turn it off!

13:20.667 --> 13:22.792
- Then pull the plug.

13:22.834 --> 13:24.792
- Wait, what?!?

13:22.834 --> 13:24.792
- Ulch...

13:32.291 --> 13:34.041
- Here! Here!

13:36.125 --> 13:40.667
Eh! Eh!

13:36.125 --> 13:40.667
Ahhhhhhhhh!!!

13:46.208 --> 13:47.625
- Nope.

13:47.667 --> 13:48.750
- Wait! Charlotte!

13:47.667 --> 13:48.750
Help us!

13:48.792 --> 13:51.750
- Don't help me,

13:48.792 --> 13:51.750
I'm fine.

13:51.792 --> 13:54.083
- What happened in here?!?

13:54.125 --> 13:55.875
- We turned on

13:54.125 --> 13:55.875
the cotton candy machine,

13:55.917 --> 13:57.542
and now we can't turn it off!

13:57.583 --> 14:01.542
- Well, how much cotton sugar

13:57.583 --> 14:01.542
did you put in there?

14:01.583 --> 14:03.750
- These two jugs.

14:03.792 --> 14:05.834
And about eight more.

14:05.875 --> 14:09.000
- Jasper.

14:05.875 --> 14:09.000
Why would y--Ugh...

14:09.041 --> 14:10.375
All right.

14:09.041 --> 14:10.375
Don't worry about it.

14:10.417 --> 14:11.917
- Why don't worry?!?

14:10.417 --> 14:11.917
- Because...

14:11.959 --> 14:14.667
it's gonna stop eventually.

14:14.709 --> 14:16.500
- Ooo, then what?!?

14:16.542 --> 14:18.875
- Then...we'll gather

14:16.542 --> 14:18.875
up all the cotton candy,

14:18.917 --> 14:21.792
put it outside that door,

14:18.917 --> 14:21.792
then we get the hose,

14:21.834 --> 14:26.208
and spray down the cotton candy,

14:21.834 --> 14:26.208
so it all washes away.

14:26.250 --> 14:27.959
- Hey! Y'know what

14:26.250 --> 14:27.959
we can do in the meantime?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.250
- No, what?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.250
- What can we do?

14:31.667 --> 14:33.375
- Wooohoooo!!!

14:35.250 --> 14:37.625
- She makes a good point.

14:37.667 --> 14:40.333
- Wooooo!

14:37.667 --> 14:40.333
Yeah!

14:42.041 --> 14:46.166
- Wooooo!

14:42.041 --> 14:46.166
Hahahaha!

14:46.208 --> 14:48.000
Yo! Yo-yo-yo!

14:46.208 --> 14:48.000
Helicopters are heli-fun!

14:48.041 --> 14:50.333
Y'know what I'm sayin'?

14:48.041 --> 14:50.333
- Yeah.

14:50.375 --> 14:52.417
- Y'know what I'm sayin'?

14:50.375 --> 14:52.417
- Yeah I know what you're sayin.

14:52.458 --> 14:54.208
- Y'know what I'm sayin'?

14:52.458 --> 14:54.208
- I know what you're saying!

14:55.959 --> 14:57.375
- Hey hey...

14:55.959 --> 14:57.375
look look look!

14:57.417 --> 14:58.834
We're not that far

14:57.417 --> 14:58.834
from Junk-N-Stuff!

14:58.875 --> 15:01.166
- Yeah so?

15:01.208 --> 15:03.542
- So c'mon,

15:01.208 --> 15:03.542
let's fly over the shop

15:03.583 --> 15:05.458
so Charlotte, Schwoz

15:03.583 --> 15:05.458
and Jasper can see us!

15:05.500 --> 15:07.000
- Uh, no no no.

15:07.041 --> 15:09.375
No. The answer is no.

15:09.417 --> 15:13.166
- Ah, yeah...

15:09.417 --> 15:13.166
of course the answer is no.

15:15.250 --> 15:18.125
- What's that supposed to mean?

15:18.166 --> 15:19.709
- That you're against fun.

15:19.750 --> 15:22.500
- What?!?

15:22.542 --> 15:24.959
- You hate fun.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.625
You're a fun-killer.

15:27.667 --> 15:30.375
- No I'm not.

15:30.417 --> 15:32.125
I love fun.

15:32.166 --> 15:34.041
- Then let's fly over

15:32.166 --> 15:34.041
Junk-N-Stuff.

15:34.083 --> 15:37.417
- No, 'cuz I think we should

15:34.083 --> 15:37.417
fly over Junk-N-Stuff.

15:39.375 --> 15:40.875
- What, yeah,

15:39.375 --> 15:40.875
that's what I want to do.

15:40.917 --> 15:43.500
- Yeah, haha, after I wanted to.

15:43.542 --> 15:44.834
- Uh, what, what?

15:44.875 --> 15:46.709
- J-just just be quiet

15:44.875 --> 15:46.709
and fly over Junk-N-Stuff

15:46.750 --> 15:48.375
so we can have some fun!

15:46.750 --> 15:48.375
All right!

15:48.417 --> 15:50.000
I'm just trying to

15:48.417 --> 15:50.000
have some fun, okay?

15:50.041 --> 15:51.583
I mean, unless

15:50.041 --> 15:51.583
you're against fun.
