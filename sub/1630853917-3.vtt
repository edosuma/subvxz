WEBVTT

00:22.856 --> 00:24.775
Mammy?

00:26.068 --> 00:27.319
Mammy.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.488
Sorry.

00:30.322 --> 00:32.366
I must have fallen asleep there.

00:32.448 --> 00:34.743
- Was it the fire again?
- Yeah.

00:34.826 --> 00:37.371
I know. I know.

00:37.996 --> 00:40.249
You could have lost me.

00:40.332 --> 00:41.875
But you didn't.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.211
- I didn't.
- No.

00:45.087 --> 00:49.758
- God must have bigger plans for you.
- I'd like to think so.

00:49.842 --> 00:51.426
- Stick the kettle on.
- Yeah.

00:56.056 --> 00:59.434
I'm so relieved we didn't put
the new kitchen units in there.

00:59.518 --> 01:00.519
Yes.

01:02.813 --> 01:06.900
Put them on the insurance, anyway.
I could have died.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.193
- I--
- Shush now.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.372
The girls are at the Forty Foot.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.416
I don't know how they find the time.

01:22.499 --> 01:25.961
- Ursula has three kids.
- They're a different kind of woman to you.

01:26.461 --> 01:29.256
They choose not
to put their families first.

01:29.840 --> 01:30.883
That's true.

01:30.966 --> 01:32.593
And you should be proud of it.

01:32.676 --> 01:35.637
"The greatest achievement
is selflessness."

01:36.138 --> 01:38.390
Well, that's very beautiful.
Where did you hear that?

01:38.473 --> 01:41.393
Moonpig. Moonpig.com.

01:48.025 --> 01:52.404
And I'm sure you'll find that
Ursula manages to make time for herself.

02:13.425 --> 02:14.801
She's very quiet this morning.

02:14.885 --> 02:17.054
Yeah, well, I'm not.
We need to-- We need to talk.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.931
Yeah, I know. Not now.

02:19.014 --> 02:20.432
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:20.516 --> 02:22.809
I didn't know you were coming.
You didn't respond to my text.

02:22.893 --> 02:25.604
I didn't realize I had to RSVP
to freeze my bollocks off.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.731
Got it. Auntie Becka, I got something!

02:27.814 --> 02:29.107
We think it's a crab.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.485
Yeah. Just give me two minutes.
I'll come in with ya.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.323
What were you two talking about?

02:36.406 --> 02:37.491
What were you asking Eva?

02:37.574 --> 02:38.909
What was I--

02:38.992 --> 02:42.287
Are you going to Grace's egg hunt
thing on Saturday?

02:42.371 --> 02:43.747
Yeah. No.

02:43.830 --> 02:47.000
I-- I can't because I'm prepping
for Sunday lunch.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.711
Yeah, I can't either.
Gonna visit her mother-in-law.

02:49.795 --> 02:51.129
Want to butter up John Paul.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.548
That's a horrible visual.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.508
I'm thinking of asking
for a loan for the studio.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.718
Why would you do that?

02:56.802 --> 02:58.220
'Cause you can't help me out.

02:58.303 --> 03:01.473
Yeah, I can't help you out now.
Just give me a couple of months.

03:01.557 --> 03:03.225
It'll be gone in a couple of months.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.727
I'm gonna give his mother
some physio on her hip.

03:05.811 --> 03:08.897
Show her I'm an investment.
Like a share in a racehorse, you know?

03:08.981 --> 03:11.525
- Or a pigeon.
- He's never gonna give you the money.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.611
Well, I'll ask Grace then. It's half hers.

03:16.780 --> 03:19.491
- What?
- You're just being naive.

03:19.575 --> 03:21.451
- She's being stupid.
- Shut your hole.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.538
Hey, Grace doesn't have her own
bank account. She shops with a Monzo.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.665
Mom, can we go in the water now?

03:26.748 --> 03:28.458
Wait for your Auntie Becka.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.710
You trying to get rid of me?

03:29.793 --> 03:31.461
You just said you'd go in with them.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.260
You kids find any crab?

03:43.223 --> 03:45.184
Hey. You all right?

03:46.643 --> 03:49.646
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Just, late.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.481
Could you bring David home to Donal?

03:51.565 --> 03:54.359
He'll be there all day.
Thanks a million. See you later.

03:55.194 --> 03:56.737
Thanks for asking. Let me--

03:56.820 --> 03:58.322
Let me think,
does that work with my plans?

03:58.405 --> 04:00.490
No problem. Leave it with me.

04:01.158 --> 04:04.161
Such a piss-take.
What is wrong with this family?

04:05.245 --> 04:07.372
So, when are we going
to have another go at killing the prick?

04:07.456 --> 04:09.124
Bibi.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.210
Not giving up just
'cause of one little setback, Eva.

04:11.293 --> 04:14.046
A setback? We blew up their home.

04:14.129 --> 04:15.756
Yeah, but not him.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.312
There's all kinds of ways
people can die by accident.

04:30.395 --> 04:31.980
All kinds of unfortunate mishaps.

04:32.064 --> 04:34.399
I was thinking something at work,
an industrial accident.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.568
We work in an
open-plan architectural firm.

04:36.652 --> 04:37.945
- What are we gonna do?
- Auntie Eva?

04:38.028 --> 04:39.655
- Paper cut him to death?
- We've got crabs.

04:39.738 --> 04:41.657
The roof terrace? The fire escape?

04:41.740 --> 04:43.450
Yeah, we're not doing anything like that.

04:43.534 --> 04:45.577
We're doing it again,
we're doing it with poison this time.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.454
Like normal women.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.493
Matt, you listening?

06:08.577 --> 06:10.204
We use what we found out at the hotel

06:10.287 --> 06:12.247
to increase the pressure
with this next sister.

06:12.331 --> 06:13.582
See what we glean.

06:13.665 --> 06:16.543
Got a contact
for a detective inspector in Malahide.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.295
Dad used to send him a hamper every year.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.379
No idea why.

06:19.463 --> 06:21.924
Probably some bet
that started years ago at the dogs.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.217
Probably just shagging his wife.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.177
So, we go after his permission
for the postmortem.

06:25.260 --> 06:26.803
That's-- That's not gonna happen.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.598
Really? Well, let's see,

06:29.681 --> 06:31.808
because I can be
a persuasive motherfucker.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.561
What?

06:34.645 --> 06:36.730
So--
Sorry, you're just ridiculous.

06:42.694 --> 06:45.822
- What are you doing? Answer it.
- No, I'm not answering it with you here.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.866
Jesus. F-- I'm ridiculous?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.291
Hello. Matthew speak--

06:57.167 --> 06:59.545
Matt, nice to hear from ya.

06:59.628 --> 07:00.754
<i>Huh?</i>

07:00.838 --> 07:03.966
I'm just about to head out.
What can I do for you?

07:04.633 --> 07:06.468
I think you called me. What's up?

07:06.552 --> 07:08.971
No, no, no. That's cold.

07:09.054 --> 07:13.892
How about you called me to say that--

07:13.976 --> 07:16.019
You called m-- You called me.

07:16.103 --> 07:19.189
That it was gorgeous
to see me the other night.

07:19.857 --> 07:21.608
It was nice to see you.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.697
I-- I really liked--
I really liked talking to you.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.740
I just, I've been-- I've been thinking--

07:28.824 --> 07:31.702
And you wanted to get that date
nailed down so you can see me again?

07:31.785 --> 07:35.706
Yeah, all right. What are you doing later?

07:36.915 --> 07:38.333
Free as a mud lark.

07:39.168 --> 07:40.752
Text me what time and where.

07:40.836 --> 07:43.755
Don't wear that tiny jacket.
Thanks for calling.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.688
It's great you answered
the phone like a big boy,

07:59.771 --> 08:03.317
but do you want to wipe this stupid smile
off your face before she opens the door?

08:20.918 --> 08:22.628
I'm your twelve o'clock.

08:23.629 --> 08:26.173
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Course.

08:29.468 --> 08:31.845
It's groin strain.

08:31.929 --> 08:32.929
Great.

08:35.474 --> 08:37.808
- Who is it, Michael?
- Two boys.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.024
Come on in. Sit down.

08:47.152 --> 08:48.445
All right.

08:55.494 --> 08:57.579
Michael, love,
go on upstairs and get ready, okay?

08:58.622 --> 08:59.623
Go on.

09:00.582 --> 09:01.875
Can I get you something to drink?

09:01.959 --> 09:04.795
- Just some water, ple--
- Coffee would be great.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.880
Didn't sleep well last night.

09:06.964 --> 09:09.842
Yeah, lucky you caught me. I was about to
take Michael to his appointment.

09:09.925 --> 09:11.093
Shouldn't take too long.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.637
Just a few questions about
your brother-in-law's accident

09:13.720 --> 09:14.763
for the insurance.

09:15.389 --> 09:16.974
Right. Yeah.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.601
<i>…the weather.
Yesterday was absolutely…</i>

09:42.040 --> 09:43.083
Tom.

09:44.585 --> 09:47.421
Tom. Get back. Tom.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.384
- Jesus Christ.
- Sorry.

09:52.467 --> 09:55.220
Sorry, I was just stretching me leg.
I have a cramp.

09:55.304 --> 09:57.347
That is usually a buildup of lactic acid.
Cramp.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.892
Right, yeah. I forgot you're a nurse.

10:01.476 --> 10:03.437
Must come in handy,
all that medical knowledge.

10:04.771 --> 10:09.693
Yeah, well, you-- you know,
handy for scrapes and child ailments.

10:11.236 --> 10:12.988
We're all out of coffee, sorry.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.201
It's a terrible business, you know.

10:20.412 --> 10:23.874
So you were with your husband
the night of John Paul's death?

10:25.250 --> 10:28.837
No, no. I was with my sisters.

10:28.921 --> 10:30.631
Yeah, right. Sorry.

10:30.714 --> 10:33.675
Your other sister said.
I-I didn't realize it was all of yous.

10:33.759 --> 10:34.927
Yeah.

10:35.010 --> 10:37.387
- So you go everywhere together?
- Well, we're close.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.556
Like a pack?

10:39.640 --> 10:41.391
Like a family.

10:42.684 --> 10:44.144
So you had dinner together or--

10:44.228 --> 10:45.312
Yeah.

10:45.896 --> 10:47.814
Nice. What did you eat?

10:48.732 --> 10:50.108
Sorry?

10:50.192 --> 10:51.527
You'd food and drinks you said.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.197
I can't remember
what we ate exactly.

10:59.701 --> 11:01.828
Probably something simple. Like…

11:03.413 --> 11:04.831
- chicken?
- Chicken.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.501
In a chimichurri sauce.

11:08.126 --> 11:09.545
That's what we'd usually have.

11:09.628 --> 11:13.590
And probably a salad and garlic rice--

11:13.674 --> 11:15.384
Is that one M? Chimichurri?

11:17.761 --> 11:19.263
I don't know.

11:19.346 --> 11:22.266
What was your relationship with
your brother-in-law like, Mrs. Garvey?

11:22.349 --> 11:24.434
Flynn. Mrs. Flynn.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.771
What do we-- It was-- It was good. Yeah.

11:27.855 --> 11:31.066
We all got on like one big,
happy family, as they say.

11:32.401 --> 11:34.278
That's not what your sister said.

11:34.987 --> 11:36.488
- Grace?
- Eva.

11:37.155 --> 11:38.448
Eva.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.492
Well, her and JP are work colleagues,

11:40.576 --> 11:42.578
so it was probably
a different story for them.

11:42.661 --> 11:45.080
And Eva's a bit of a hothead, unlike me.

11:46.081 --> 11:47.374
What are you like?

11:48.333 --> 11:50.127
What am I like?

11:50.919 --> 11:56.967
I'm-- I'm a mother and a wife.

11:57.843 --> 11:59.386
I'm a nurse.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.848
Don't know what else to say.

12:02.931 --> 12:05.225
I lead a pretty boring life, to be honest.

12:22.701 --> 12:23.911
I miss you.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.412
I'm not gone yet.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.414
Miss you in five minutes then.

12:35.506 --> 12:38.300
Oh, before I forget.

12:38.383 --> 12:39.551
Free hotel swag.

12:41.970 --> 12:45.182
- You can think of me in the shower.
- I don't think about much else.

12:46.183 --> 12:47.518
I have to go.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.561
I should bring Michael
to a doctor's appointment,

12:49.645 --> 12:50.979
and then I start my night shift.

12:51.063 --> 12:52.940
I should have been sleeping today,
not, you know?

12:53.565 --> 12:57.486
I'm sorry I didn't let you sleep.
There was just too much to do.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.788
Did I tell you
I have deep feelings for you?

13:26.807 --> 13:28.725
<i>Up into Ulster this afternoon,</i>

13:28.809 --> 13:31.937
<i>reaching parts of Munster
and north Leinster later this evening.</i>

13:32.646 --> 13:35.691
<i>Largely dry elsewhere
with sunny spells developing.</i>

13:36.191 --> 13:37.568
<i>Highest temperatures…</i>

13:37.651 --> 13:38.986
Shit.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.947
No, not here.

13:47.369 --> 13:48.704
John Paul.

13:52.291 --> 13:54.251
Oh, that's quite the ding.

13:55.794 --> 13:58.755
I'm going to have to take your details,
sister-in-law.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.215
Of course. Yeah.

14:00.299 --> 14:03.969
- Sorry, I don't know how that--
- 181-D-588.

14:04.052 --> 14:07.306
Location?
What's the name of this hotel? Or…

14:07.890 --> 14:09.266
Is it a brothel?

14:12.019 --> 14:13.020
Did you follow me here?

14:13.103 --> 14:14.980
Is this how you like
to spend your time off?

14:15.063 --> 14:17.524
Not with your kids?
Not with your disabled son?

14:17.608 --> 14:19.985
Do not talk about my son.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.987
Does Donal know about your little affair?

14:25.407 --> 14:26.909
- John Paul, if--
- Finish it.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.912
Or I'll tell him.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.331
You're vile.

14:34.291 --> 14:35.542
Do you know that?

14:36.460 --> 14:38.545
Disgraceful. That's what you are.

14:39.171 --> 14:40.631
And disgusting.

14:40.714 --> 14:44.718
Disgraceful, vile and disgusting.
That's what you are.

14:47.554 --> 14:52.017
Vile, disgusting, and disgraceful.
That's you, Ursula Garvey.

14:52.100 --> 14:54.853
Vile, disgusting, and disgraceful.

14:59.316 --> 15:02.569
Got you by the short and curlies,
Ursula Garvey.

15:04.530 --> 15:05.948
Hello, Gerald.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.449
<i>Oh, where the hell are you?</i>

15:07.533 --> 15:09.159
I was just heading back
to the office now.

15:09.243 --> 15:12.412
- They kept waiting to--
-<i>I don't wanna hear it.</i>

15:12.496 --> 15:15.165
- Sorry, it definitely won't happen again.
-<i>Get back to the office now.</i>

15:15.249 --> 15:17.376
- I'm-- I'm terribly sorry.
-<i>Bloody liberty.</i>

15:18.210 --> 15:19.378
Fuck.

15:21.046 --> 15:22.297
Hi.

15:23.549 --> 15:24.842
We put it in his liver.

15:25.801 --> 15:28.136
- What?
-<i>Monday is liver day.</i>

15:28.220 --> 15:31.348
<i>Only JP eats it, but he makes her
cook it every bloody week.</i>

15:31.431 --> 15:33.642
<i>Grace always gets something else
for herself and Blanaid.</i>

15:33.725 --> 15:36.144
Well, how do we get it in there?

15:36.228 --> 15:37.604
I think we bring Ursula in on this.

15:37.688 --> 15:38.981
If anyone's gonna know how to do it,

15:39.064 --> 15:40.607
-<i>it's a nurse.</i>
- What? No, no way.

15:40.691 --> 15:41.775
Why not?

15:41.859 --> 15:43.694
Because she'd never--

15:43.777 --> 15:45.612
- She's a mother.
- So am I.

15:45.696 --> 15:49.283
Yeah, but you're-- Well, she--
she's got morals. She's--

15:49.366 --> 15:51.368
Bibi, I'm not getting into this
on the phone at work.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.370
- Can I come round?
-<i>No.</i>

15:53.453 --> 15:54.538
<i>What?</i>

15:55.163 --> 15:57.040
Oh, God. Fine. Come round tomorrow night.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.834
I'll try and bunk off a bit earlier.

15:58.917 --> 16:01.503
Come on, everybody.
It's the Thursday raffle.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.131
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, thank you.

16:04.214 --> 16:06.300
Sorry.

16:06.383 --> 16:07.426
Eva?

16:07.509 --> 16:08.844
Sorry. You just-- You startled me.

16:08.927 --> 16:10.721
I'm very startling.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.515
- Did you buy a ticket?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:13.599 --> 16:16.393
I mean, I-- I buy all the tickets
to all the charities.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.978
I just-- Catholic guilt, you know?

16:18.061 --> 16:21.440
War Child, Help the Aged. Donkey Sanctuary
got a big payout last week.

16:21.523 --> 16:23.817
- Oh, you have a big heart.
- Yeah, I care a lot about donkeys.

16:27.362 --> 16:28.906
What are you up to for the weekend?

16:32.075 --> 16:36.663
Oh, I'm just sitting on my sofa watching,
true crime documentaries.

16:36.747 --> 16:38.081
Nazis, probably.

16:39.583 --> 16:41.376
- You?
- Same.

16:41.460 --> 16:43.837
Yeah, I don't believe
that for a second.

16:44.463 --> 16:45.464
Oh, come on.

16:45.547 --> 16:47.508
Oh, it's green, 2-1-6.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.176
Green ticket, 2-1-6.

16:49.259 --> 16:50.511
- Shit.
- You got it?

16:50.594 --> 16:51.595
It's me.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.555
- Yeah, we have a winner.
- No.

16:56.934 --> 17:00.229
Something for the weekend.
Not that you'll need it, I'm sure.

17:00.312 --> 17:02.105
- Thank you so much.
- Enjoy.

17:02.689 --> 17:03.857
How did they know?

17:03.941 --> 17:06.151
If a man did that, can you imagine?

17:07.736 --> 17:10.781
Listen, we should go for a drink sometime.

17:11.323 --> 17:12.782
When you're not watching Nazis.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.284
Huh?

17:14.367 --> 17:17.746
- A drink? Liquid alcohol? Glass container?
- Sorry? Yes, yeah.

17:17.829 --> 17:19.580
Yeah, that would be-- I'd like that.

17:19.665 --> 17:22.125
- That'd be-- Yeah, give me a call, okay.
- Okay.

17:23.544 --> 17:24.670
<i>What the fuck, Eva?</i>

17:24.752 --> 17:27.172
Oh, shit! Sorry! Sorry.

17:27.256 --> 17:29.258
<i>Sorry. God, I think I just got asked out.</i>

17:29.842 --> 17:31.134
Oh, and I won a dildo.

17:34.137 --> 17:36.473
Minna. It's Becka.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.184
Hello? Minna?

17:40.352 --> 17:42.896
Oh, come in. Come in.

17:42.980 --> 17:45.065
I left my G-string on.

17:49.027 --> 17:51.071
It's on backwards, but great stuff.

17:57.536 --> 17:59.621
I'm seeing this lad called Callum.

18:00.539 --> 18:03.250
I don't want to shock you,
but I'm just in it for the sex.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.752
That's how George and I began.

18:05.836 --> 18:10.424
He only wanted one thing,
but then he saw what else I had.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.888
You're gas.
Are you sure you're John Paul's ma?

18:15.971 --> 18:19.600
Nah. I think they dipped him in vinegar
before they handed him over.

18:22.603 --> 18:25.397
Sorry. All done now, anyway.

18:33.488 --> 18:36.950
George collected all this.
George is my hubby.

18:37.034 --> 18:38.535
He should be home soon.

18:43.373 --> 18:46.376
So how did George manage
to land a beautiful girl like you?

18:46.460 --> 18:47.878
He threw a dead bird at me.

18:48.545 --> 18:51.507
Oh, really? That's interesting.

18:51.590 --> 18:52.841
It got my attention.

18:54.551 --> 18:55.552
Strange.

18:56.178 --> 18:58.430
Love makes you do strange things.

19:00.015 --> 19:02.309
Why stick a finger up someone's asshole?

19:02.392 --> 19:05.604
Well, he didn't deserve you.

19:06.772 --> 19:08.106
They're all bastards, right?

19:08.982 --> 19:11.026
No, dear. They are not.

19:13.195 --> 19:16.615
But he just walked out on you.
I mean he just left you.

19:16.698 --> 19:20.536
No, that is not the story.
He will be back very soon.

19:24.122 --> 19:25.332
Hey.

19:26.917 --> 19:28.794
Oh, look, Blanaid has a bouncy castle.

19:28.877 --> 19:31.380
You didn't bring the basket, Ursula.
Ursula?

19:32.422 --> 19:33.465
- Enjoy kids.
- Bye, Dad!

19:33.549 --> 19:34.925
I'll bring you a bucket of eggs.

19:36.635 --> 19:38.095
- You're not coming in?
- No.

19:38.178 --> 19:40.430
I'll leave the Easter Bunny
to you and the girls, JP.

19:40.514 --> 19:43.433
Got to keep the wife happy.
God knows what could happen otherwise.

19:43.517 --> 19:45.936
Oh, I hear you.
Very hard to keep this one happy, though.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.437
Bet she's worth it.

19:51.775 --> 19:53.068
- See you later.
- Later.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.405
See you.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.827
Is it finished with your fuck buddy?

20:03.036 --> 20:04.788
Urs. Come on.

20:04.872 --> 20:06.373
- Yeah, coming.
- End it.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.667
Or I'll tell Donal. I swear, I mean it.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.961
It's over, okay?

20:12.880 --> 20:13.881
It's finished.

20:15.716 --> 20:18.468
Well, in that case, in you go.

20:22.472 --> 20:24.183
Hello, you.

20:24.683 --> 20:26.268
Come to daddy, Oscar.

20:26.768 --> 20:27.895
Hello.

20:32.983 --> 20:34.401
Anything else I can help you with?

20:34.484 --> 20:35.986
Yeah, actually.

20:36.069 --> 20:39.198
Your brother-in-law claimed
for a car accident

20:39.281 --> 20:41.158
at the Marker Hotel about four months ago.

20:41.909 --> 20:45.287
If I'm not mistaken,
you were involved in that accident too.

20:45.871 --> 20:47.998
Yes. Yes, I was.

20:49.833 --> 20:51.627
It was just a little ding-a-ling, really.

20:51.710 --> 20:53.462
What were you both doing at the hotel?

20:53.545 --> 20:54.796
Well…

20:54.880 --> 21:00.177
I was having lunch
with an old friend and--

21:01.428 --> 21:03.889
Well, I don't know what--
I don't know what JP was doing.

21:03.972 --> 21:05.474
And who was the old friend?

21:08.018 --> 21:09.853
It's probably none of your business.

21:09.937 --> 21:11.271
I know. Sorry.

21:11.355 --> 21:14.566
I didn't see your name
in the reservations book, is all.

21:14.650 --> 21:16.652
That's because I didn't make
a reservation.

21:17.611 --> 21:19.613
I just walked in.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.658
Always more fun not to plan.

21:23.242 --> 21:24.284
I'm the same.

21:24.952 --> 21:26.995
Although, it can often lead
to disappointment.

21:27.079 --> 21:30.457
I have a lot to be getting on with today,
so if there's anything else you need--

21:30.541 --> 21:33.335
Yes. May I use
the little boy's room quickly?

21:34.878 --> 21:36.713
Top of the stairs,
second door on the left.

21:39.466 --> 21:41.301
Potluck whether it's been flushed or not.

21:52.980 --> 21:54.022
Hello.

21:54.106 --> 21:56.233
- Hey.
-<i>No problem.</i>

21:57.025 --> 21:59.319
<i>What? Why are you talking funny?</i>

21:59.403 --> 22:01.029
- Okay.
-<i>The insurance twats?</i>

22:01.113 --> 22:03.532
- Yeah, it's all-- It's all great.
-<i>I told you you'd be next.</i>

22:03.615 --> 22:06.243
- Oh, shit. Are they still there?
-<i>It's all great.</i>

22:06.326 --> 22:09.204
-<i>Don't-- Don't panic because-- Yeah.</i>
- I'll-- I'll call you later.

22:09.288 --> 22:11.373
Hello. Oh, shit.

22:17.462 --> 22:18.922
Did you hear that?

22:19.882 --> 22:21.550
- Sorry?
- Nothing.

22:53.707 --> 22:54.791
There he is now.

22:54.875 --> 22:57.044
- We'll be out of your hair.
- Good stuff.

22:57.127 --> 22:58.128
Yeah.

23:00.923 --> 23:02.174
You know what?

23:02.966 --> 23:06.637
I've been debating whether to ask this,
but I'm worried if I don't,

23:06.720 --> 23:10.390
I'll just be all…
irked at myself later.

23:12.643 --> 23:14.186
Were you having an affair?

23:14.728 --> 23:16.021
With your brother-in-law?

23:16.897 --> 23:17.898
What?

23:19.066 --> 23:21.026
Why would you ask something like that?

23:21.109 --> 23:23.487
Just, you know-- Just a hunch.

23:24.530 --> 23:27.324
Being at a hotel together during the day,
and I know you said--

23:27.407 --> 23:31.995
I was not having an affair with John Paul.
No chance on this earth.

23:32.079 --> 23:35.582
The very suggestion of anything intimate
with that man is just--

23:35.666 --> 23:36.917
Christ!

23:37.000 --> 23:39.169
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

23:39.253 --> 23:40.254
Hey.

23:40.754 --> 23:43.465
These gentlemen are, just--

23:43.549 --> 23:48.136
They're handling John Paul--
Grace's insurance policy.

23:48.846 --> 23:50.138
Right. Good to meet you.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.235
We'll leave you to it.

24:14.997 --> 24:16.915
She did not like her brother-in-law.

24:16.999 --> 24:18.625
You're not joking.

24:18.709 --> 24:21.545
Well, two more sisters to go.

24:21.628 --> 24:25.549
Just keep shaking the trees,
see what other shit apples fall out.

24:30.721 --> 24:32.764
Dickhead. Who does that?

24:40.189 --> 24:42.357
- What? Who does that?
- It's fine.

24:43.775 --> 24:45.569
Where you going now? Fancy a pint?

24:45.652 --> 24:47.738
I've got my own plans, thank you.

24:47.821 --> 24:49.865
But you can have fun
with your rubbish bag.

24:52.326 --> 24:54.203
I need a lift to my place.

24:56.413 --> 24:57.497
Knew it.

25:02.169 --> 25:06.006
"Death cap is responsible
for most fatal mushroom poisonings.

25:06.924 --> 25:10.219
The extraction of toxins can be done
through liquid fungal cultures."

25:10.302 --> 25:12.012
I don't even know what that means.

25:12.095 --> 25:15.516
"The principal toxic constituent
is amanitin,

25:15.599 --> 25:19.019
which causes liver and kidney failure
that can be fatal."

25:19.561 --> 25:20.687
- Can.
- Will.

25:21.355 --> 25:23.357
If we extract enough,

25:23.440 --> 25:25.275
then one of these little
bad boys will kill you.

25:25.776 --> 25:28.070
Okay, but how? How do we do that?

25:31.532 --> 25:32.824
Are these library books?

25:33.909 --> 25:35.827
You know there'd be a record
of what you borrowed?

25:35.911 --> 25:37.955
No, there won't. I stole them.

25:38.038 --> 25:40.791
You stole books from a library?

25:40.874 --> 25:42.793
Calm your ham, I'm gonna bring them back.

25:45.963 --> 25:47.631
Well, clean up this shit.

25:53.470 --> 25:54.471
Urs! Hi?

25:54.555 --> 25:56.932
- Sorry. Have you got a moment?
- Hey, what's up?

25:57.015 --> 26:00.060
Yeah. Yeah. Of course, come in.

26:02.271 --> 26:04.523
It's, it's more than just a fling.

26:05.482 --> 26:06.859
Does Donal know?

26:10.612 --> 26:12.656
- I don't want to hurt him.
- Yeah.

26:14.408 --> 26:15.701
I don't want to lose the kids.

26:15.784 --> 26:17.411
You're not gonna lose the kids.

26:17.494 --> 26:18.495
Just…

26:20.038 --> 26:21.081
How long has it been going on?

26:21.164 --> 26:22.833
Just over a year.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.127
Why are you telling me now?

26:27.421 --> 26:29.131
The prick, Eva.

26:30.424 --> 26:32.134
He found out. He followed me.

26:33.635 --> 26:35.095
Fuck. What?

26:35.179 --> 26:37.222
If I don't end it,
he's gonna tell Donal everything.

26:37.306 --> 26:40.100
And I-I tried.
And I tried, I really tried.

26:41.894 --> 26:43.103
I hate myself.

26:44.313 --> 26:46.273
I just lie, and I cheat.

26:46.356 --> 26:48.567
No. Come here, it's fine. Stop.

26:50.903 --> 26:53.614
I feel like I used to, you know?
When I'm-- When I'm with him.

26:54.865 --> 26:56.116
I feel young.

26:56.992 --> 27:00.204
Part of me that's just been sleepwalking
through life for years is--

27:00.287 --> 27:01.288
is awake again.

27:01.371 --> 27:02.998
- Wow.
- Fuck's sake.

27:03.081 --> 27:05.292
- Jesus Christ, Bibi.
- Sorry. Okay.

27:05.375 --> 27:08.045
First of all, I'm gonna vomit.
You're pathetic.

27:08.128 --> 27:10.797
And secondly, there's another option.

27:10.881 --> 27:12.591
- Shut up.
- Why? We need her help anyway.

27:12.674 --> 27:14.259
- Shut up, Bibi.
- What's she talking about?

27:14.343 --> 27:17.137
Second option is we lance
the seeping boil that is the prick.

27:18.096 --> 27:19.264
We get rid of him.

27:19.848 --> 27:21.892
Get rid of him? What are you on about?

27:21.975 --> 27:23.393
Fucking hell.

27:24.228 --> 27:25.312
Hang on.

27:25.395 --> 27:27.940
We just want to give nature
a helping hand.

27:33.570 --> 27:35.948
Are you out of your fucking mind?

27:36.031 --> 27:37.866
Yeah. May-- I don't know. Maybe.

27:38.575 --> 27:41.578
No. No. I'm sorry.
You're not dragging me into this.

27:41.662 --> 27:42.996
No fucking way.

27:46.667 --> 27:47.960
Am I-- Am I culpable now?

27:49.086 --> 27:52.631
Because you told me ab--
You can't do this.

27:52.714 --> 27:56.635
You're gonna land yourselves,
and me, in jail or worse.

27:56.718 --> 27:58.929
We're gonna poison him, Ursula,
with or without your consent,

27:59.012 --> 28:00.514
and we have no intention
of getting caught.

28:00.597 --> 28:03.684
And how exactly are you planning
on doing that?

28:05.602 --> 28:06.645
Death cap.

28:07.855 --> 28:08.856
Are you insane?

28:10.315 --> 28:11.900
What about Blanaid?

28:13.527 --> 28:14.987
What-- What about Grace?

28:15.070 --> 28:18.198
We're gonna do it on liver day.
Only the prick eats it.

28:18.282 --> 28:21.201
That's why we need your help. We just
don't know how to extract the poison.

28:21.285 --> 28:25.914
The first signs of death cap poisoning
are vomiting and diarrhea.

28:26.874 --> 28:29.209
He'll go to A&E, and they'll do tests,

28:29.293 --> 28:32.212
and they'll find amanitin in his blood,
and then they'll call the police.

28:32.296 --> 28:34.590
And then, when he dies
between three and five days later,

28:34.673 --> 28:36.884
they'll be searching for the idiots
who poisoned him.

28:36.967 --> 28:41.471
See? This is why we need your help.
What would you recommend instead?

28:43.557 --> 28:44.558
Urs, we--

28:45.434 --> 28:47.936
Great. That's great.

29:09.208 --> 29:11.668
All right, that's me off
to my night shift, Urs.

29:11.752 --> 29:13.253
Have fun at Eva's tomorrow.

29:22.804 --> 29:23.805
Hey.

29:27.100 --> 29:30.229
- Do you want a bottle opener for that?
- No, I brought that. That's a screw cap.

29:30.312 --> 29:31.313
Classy.

29:31.396 --> 29:32.606
Slut.

29:35.317 --> 29:37.569
What? She was being a judgy bitch.

29:47.496 --> 29:50.958
Hey! Oh, I'll watch next time.
Okay? Catch.

29:52.376 --> 29:53.544
Help.

29:56.797 --> 29:58.924
- Hi.
- Hey. Oh, hi. I wasn't expecting to--

29:59.007 --> 30:01.134
Lemon meringue pie. It has a biscuit base,

30:01.218 --> 30:03.136
and I didn't have time
to make pastries, sorry.

30:03.220 --> 30:05.389
You can't beat this woman's pies.
Pastry or not.

30:05.472 --> 30:07.057
Is it okay? I tried calling.

30:07.140 --> 30:09.309
Yeah, of course.
It's just, you're not usually--

30:09.393 --> 30:10.602
It was John Paul's idea.

30:12.646 --> 30:13.647
Hey, hon.

30:14.314 --> 30:16.692
Okay, she'll be better at this.
We can do this.

30:17.734 --> 30:18.902
No Donal today?

30:19.570 --> 30:20.571
He's working.

30:21.613 --> 30:24.491
That's a shame.
Poor Donal, always missing out.

30:24.575 --> 30:26.201
Yeah.

30:26.285 --> 30:27.286
Okay.

30:33.584 --> 30:35.169
- Lamb?
- I have lots. Thanks.

30:35.252 --> 30:37.087
When's the cabin getting sorted, JP?

30:37.171 --> 30:40.424
The insurance company is being thorny,
but they'll pay out.

30:40.507 --> 30:44.720
Suspicious bloody terriers.
Mammy's very upset.

30:44.803 --> 30:47.181
Well… I had two photo albums in there.

30:47.264 --> 30:49.391
Oh, God. I'm so sorry, Grace.

30:49.474 --> 30:53.187
Yeah, only holiday snaps
of Blanaid when she was little

30:53.270 --> 30:56.023
and others I can't remember,
but photos I can't replace, you know?

30:56.106 --> 30:57.316
And my Rolex

30:57.399 --> 30:59.818
and the stereo system
and the wide-screen TV.

30:59.902 --> 31:03.530
He's making light of it,
but he was really shocked.

31:03.614 --> 31:06.325
We're just counting our blessings
that he wasn't actually in there.

31:06.408 --> 31:09.077
Grace, thank God
you and Blanaid weren't there.

31:09.578 --> 31:11.580
I mean, Christ,
it doesn't bear thinking about.

31:11.663 --> 31:13.832
Yeah.
Well, we were at the concert, so…

31:16.043 --> 31:17.961
Can you pass the green beans
over there?

31:19.296 --> 31:20.297
More sauce?

31:21.590 --> 31:22.716
No.

31:24.551 --> 31:28.055
I'll have some. Thank you.

31:30.140 --> 31:31.934
- It's mint.
- You won't like it, pet.

31:33.894 --> 31:34.895
What is that?

31:34.978 --> 31:36.605
Ursula!

31:36.688 --> 31:37.731
Are you doing then?

31:37.814 --> 31:38.941
- Come on!
- Why?

31:39.024 --> 31:41.235
- No!
- Becka! Becka! Becka!

31:41.318 --> 31:43.695
Why do we have to do it?

31:43.779 --> 31:45.405
'Cause what would Dad say if we didn't?

31:45.489 --> 31:47.407
He would say…

31:48.575 --> 31:50.494
"This country

31:50.577 --> 31:56.291
was made a free republic
on Easter Sunday in 1916.

31:56.375 --> 31:57.751
Do the poem, girleen!"

31:59.127 --> 32:00.212
Drunk. Drunk and all.

32:02.130 --> 32:05.300
"We knew enough to know that dre"--
I've forgotten--

32:05.384 --> 32:07.761
forgotten the whole thing. I'm so sorry.

32:07.845 --> 32:09.555
- You know this.
- Okay. "We--

32:11.348 --> 32:13.559
We knew their dream; enough
To know they dreamed"--

32:13.642 --> 32:15.769
Don't you laugh-- "And are dead."

32:15.853 --> 32:17.813
- Go!
- Oh, it's me.

32:17.896 --> 32:23.193
"And what if-- What if excess of love
Bewildered them till they died?"

32:23.277 --> 32:24.611
Urs!

32:24.695 --> 32:27.656
- Go on.
-"Write it out in a verse--"

32:27.739 --> 32:29.366
"MacDonagh and MacBride."

32:29.449 --> 32:31.201
Yes! She knows it.

32:31.285 --> 32:33.787
Come on! Go on.

32:33.871 --> 32:35.330
"And…"

32:35.414 --> 32:36.874
- And to…
-"Connolly!"

32:36.957 --> 32:38.584
- Yay!
- And…

32:38.667 --> 32:40.294
Look at her, so happy with ourselves.

32:40.377 --> 32:42.087
And… And…

32:42.171 --> 32:43.714
- And…
-"And…"

32:43.797 --> 32:44.631
"Pearse."

32:44.715 --> 32:45.716
Yes!

32:45.799 --> 32:50.387
"Now, and in time to be,
Wherever green is worn--

32:50.470 --> 32:52.347
- Are changed…
- Changed…

32:52.431 --> 32:55.184
- Come on. Changed…
- Are changed…

32:55.267 --> 32:59.646
"Utterly: A terrible beauty is born."

32:59.730 --> 33:00.731
Come on!

33:10.157 --> 33:12.951
- Mommy?
- Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

33:13.035 --> 33:15.579
- Too loud?
- It's like having a train in my head.

33:15.662 --> 33:17.915
It's like a train in your head. I'm sorry.

33:17.998 --> 33:19.458
Sorry, Michael.

33:20.626 --> 33:23.462
Like an IRA meeting.

33:24.213 --> 33:26.089
Awful.

33:26.173 --> 33:27.841
But we have lovely voices, though, right?

33:27.925 --> 33:30.177
- Yeah, but noisy mammies.
- Noisy mammies?

33:31.553 --> 33:33.138
Drinky mammies.

33:34.306 --> 33:35.307
Not all mammies.

33:35.390 --> 33:37.226
- Is there any more meat, Mammy?
- I'll just go.

33:37.309 --> 33:39.061
Okay. So, take those.

33:40.187 --> 33:42.147
Don't--
Don't get the foils all over my garden.

33:42.898 --> 33:44.274
Do you want some more?

33:45.984 --> 33:48.153
- No. No.
- I'm just giving…

33:48.237 --> 33:50.197
Yeah, that's Easter.
I love the way you've always made--

33:50.280 --> 33:53.951
…to get lots of animals.
Like, maybe a caterpillar.

33:54.535 --> 33:56.078
Sorry, I just really need to pee.

33:56.161 --> 33:57.579
You do want
any of the one you brought?

33:57.663 --> 33:58.664
It will be--

34:07.965 --> 34:10.259
- Really?
- Yeah. I recommend it.

34:13.011 --> 34:18.225
It was in the 12 euros.

34:38.996 --> 34:40.289
Oh, God, that's disgusting.

35:03.896 --> 35:04.938
Yep.

35:07.983 --> 35:09.776
Yep! Coming.

35:14.114 --> 35:15.449
Sorry, I was gonna pee myself.

35:15.532 --> 35:18.368
And you haven't even had kids yet.

35:21.622 --> 35:23.415
- To family. To…
- To family. To you.

35:23.498 --> 35:25.751
To having you here at-- on Easter.

35:25.834 --> 35:29.379
- It's so lovely seeing you together…
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

35:30.464 --> 35:33.759
Yeah. But even the--
with the smaller ones.

35:33.842 --> 35:35.636
They're just adorable together.

35:42.601 --> 35:44.061
Right.

35:44.144 --> 35:46.855
Who wants some Easter flan,
courtesy of me?

35:46.939 --> 35:49.024
- No flan.
- Oh, I love your weird flan.

35:49.107 --> 35:52.528
Did you just ask if we wanted flan
while pulling your flies up?

35:52.611 --> 35:55.906
Have you washed your hands,
you dirty bitch?

35:55.989 --> 35:58.033
Of course, I washed my hands!

36:00.827 --> 36:02.996
- In the shape of a cross.
- Yeah.

36:03.080 --> 36:05.958
Why must she force feed us flan?

36:07.835 --> 36:09.545
I've been sitting on that one forever.

36:11.046 --> 36:13.257
All your life.
I'm really glad you did.

36:13.340 --> 36:14.550
Come on.

36:22.057 --> 36:24.351
How long will it last? Till…

36:24.434 --> 36:26.687
It'll last about six months.

36:27.187 --> 36:29.731
I'm in. I love--
I love how there's never any…

36:29.815 --> 36:30.816
Come on, Bibi.

37:23.452 --> 37:25.787
Well, I told you there'd be eggs,
and now there's no baskets.

37:25.871 --> 37:27.831
- Molly, get-- get your coat, okay?
- What? Why?

37:27.915 --> 37:29.124
We're going home. I'm sorry, okay?

37:29.208 --> 37:31.001
We have to go. Guys, go get your coats on.

37:31.084 --> 37:33.795
You look very shook. Have some flan.

37:33.879 --> 37:34.963
Where are you going?

37:35.047 --> 37:36.798
- I'm so sorry, guys, but we have to go.
- Urs?

37:36.882 --> 37:38.383
Grab your stuff and get in the car.

37:38.467 --> 37:40.469
Urs! Urs, wait!

37:40.552 --> 37:42.721
- Come on, let's go.
- Urs. Molly. Can you just wait?

37:42.804 --> 37:45.682
- Just get in. That's it. Close the door.
- Oh, my god. Can you just-- Urs!

37:45.766 --> 37:46.934
I can explain about the cabin.

37:47.017 --> 37:48.644
- What?
- Sorry. Can we talk?

37:48.727 --> 37:50.646
No, it's not that. It's nothing.
It's-- Thank you.

37:50.729 --> 37:52.523
It's, Donal's come home to us.

37:52.606 --> 37:55.400
And you know how he loves Easter,
so I just want to-- I want us to be there.

37:55.484 --> 37:57.319
- No, I don't.
- Will you close the door?

37:58.278 --> 38:01.240
Look, give--
give me a call when you-- Jesus.

38:01.323 --> 38:02.574
Take--

38:05.285 --> 38:06.662
Drive carefully!

38:10.082 --> 38:17.130
Pick up, pick up. Come on, come on.
Pick up. Donal. Come on! Pick up!

38:18.882 --> 38:20.425
What's going on, Mom? Mom!

38:20.509 --> 38:21.593
Nothing!

38:21.677 --> 38:23.554
I want flan!

38:23.637 --> 38:25.013
Pick up. Pick up.

38:25.097 --> 38:27.099
Auntie Becka said
she had a special egg for me.

38:27.182 --> 38:28.725
- Why did we have to leave?
- Pick up.

38:28.809 --> 38:30.978
And Michael wants flan, Ursula.

38:31.061 --> 38:33.105
Yeah, we have to meet your father,
okay? It's urgent.

38:33.188 --> 38:35.607
Just, put some headphones
on your brother, Molly, and--

38:35.691 --> 38:39.570
Jesus! Jesus Christ, man!

38:41.405 --> 38:43.115
Jesus Christ, man.

38:43.198 --> 38:45.492
Jesus Christ, man.

38:45.576 --> 38:47.661
Jesus Christ, man.

38:47.744 --> 38:50.956
- Jesus Chr--
- Jesus Christ, man!

38:51.039 --> 38:52.791
Jesus Christ, man.

38:52.875 --> 38:55.752
- Jesus Christ, man.
- Jesus Christ, man!

38:55.836 --> 38:58.380
- Jesus Christ, man!
- Jesus Christ, man!

39:08.473 --> 39:09.474
Stay here.

39:09.558 --> 39:11.310
Molly, you're in charge.

39:11.393 --> 39:13.520
- I don't want to.
- Molly, please!

39:13.604 --> 39:15.856
Miss Murphy says you have to say
no when we don't consent,

39:15.939 --> 39:17.232
and I do not consent!

39:17.316 --> 39:19.026
I don't care about consent!

39:19.109 --> 39:21.153
- Follow her in. Follow her in.
- I'm going.

39:26.158 --> 39:28.785
Why are you following me?
Go back to the car.

39:31.580 --> 39:33.081
Jesus Christ, man!

39:37.586 --> 39:39.046
- Ursula.
- Hi!

39:43.217 --> 39:44.760
Excuse me. Pardon me. Thanks.

39:44.843 --> 39:46.261
Sorry.

39:46.345 --> 39:47.429
Sorry!

39:49.139 --> 39:52.100
- No!
- No! Come on, leave them! Come on!

39:56.605 --> 39:59.274
- Hey, Ursula.
- Hi! Yeah.

39:59.358 --> 40:01.527
- What's Daddy's PIN?
- Mammy, I can't say.

40:01.610 --> 40:04.363
Molly! I will let you get
the top of your ear pierced.

40:04.446 --> 40:05.989
Two, four, seven, six, six, six.

40:07.699 --> 40:10.160
You shouldn't steal
people's private information, Ursula.

40:10.244 --> 40:12.663
Stop calling me Ursula!

40:26.885 --> 40:28.804
- Hey. Everything okay?
- Hi.

40:28.887 --> 40:30.472
- Yeah--
- Mom said that--

40:30.556 --> 40:33.392
That we were,
bringing you this because,

40:33.475 --> 40:35.435
we all missed Daddy today, didn't we?

40:35.519 --> 40:38.480
And we know that you love…
…Easter, so--

40:41.275 --> 40:42.734
I love you.

40:44.319 --> 40:45.571
Oh, brilliant.

40:53.745 --> 40:56.331
Metildigoxin.
Inject 300 milligrams into the liver.

40:56.415 --> 40:58.292
It will cause fatal cardiac arrhythmia.

40:59.126 --> 41:00.127
But I thought you--

41:00.210 --> 41:03.338
No doctor is going to think a heart attack
a man his age is suspicious.

41:06.967 --> 41:09.636
And do it quick, before I change my mind.

41:12.347 --> 41:13.432
Thank you!

41:30.324 --> 41:32.784
- Come on, pick up.
- Thomas?

41:32.868 --> 41:33.869
Yes?

41:33.952 --> 41:35.454
-<i>Hello?</i>
- Shit!

41:35.537 --> 41:36.580
<i>Pardon?</i>

41:36.663 --> 41:38.832
Nothing. I'm so sorry.
Just give me one second.

41:38.916 --> 41:41.084
- Are you okay?
- I have to pee again!

41:41.835 --> 41:43.962
Absolutely. Two-- Two ticks.
Give me two ticks.

41:44.046 --> 41:45.464
- Huge apologies.
-<i>Who is this?</i>

41:45.547 --> 41:47.174
Listen, you don't know me.

41:47.257 --> 41:50.093
I've left a number of messages
with your office. Thomas Claffin.

41:52.596 --> 41:53.972
Postmortem man.

41:54.056 --> 41:58.227
Yeah, world's shittest superhero.
Although, actually, you know--

41:58.310 --> 42:00.354
Thomas, I'm no joke gonna piss the bed.

42:00.437 --> 42:01.438
What do you want?

42:01.522 --> 42:04.900
<i>Listen, I'm a friend of
Malcolm Hill. He gave me your number and…</i>

42:05.609 --> 42:08.654
I am so sorry to bother you of an evening.
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

42:08.737 --> 42:10.739
I'm in the middle of a crime scene…

42:11.782 --> 42:13.408
investigation.

42:14.117 --> 42:15.160
Thomas!

42:15.244 --> 42:18.288
Shit. Look,
normally I'd leave you to your crime scene

42:18.372 --> 42:20.374
<i>like a normal human,
but we're really up against it.</i>

42:20.457 --> 42:25.420
This postmortem has been requested
by nobody, Mr. Claffin, apart from you.

42:25.504 --> 42:27.923
Not by the law, not by the family,
not by the authorit--

42:28.006 --> 42:30.008
No, no, I have the widow's permission.

42:30.092 --> 42:32.511
Jesus Christ.

42:32.594 --> 42:36.306
<i>What do you say, Inspector?
Can we talk you through our findings?</i>

42:38.058 --> 42:39.226
Fine, yeah. Look it.

42:39.309 --> 42:41.687
<i>Call the office in the morning.
Arrange an appointment.</i>

42:41.770 --> 42:44.106
<i>Thank you, thank you very much, Inspector.</i>

42:44.189 --> 42:45.691
I'm gonna piss the bed!

42:45.774 --> 42:46.942
Coming!

42:47.025 --> 42:49.611
Sorry, just some shouting at me wife.
She's pregnant.

42:51.947 --> 42:53.323
Hello? Hello?

42:54.783 --> 42:56.034
Too late!

43:03.625 --> 43:05.252
Oi! Pervert!

43:11.341 --> 43:12.467
Hi.

43:12.551 --> 43:13.552
Hi.

43:17.723 --> 43:18.724
That's nice.

43:18.807 --> 43:19.808
Yeah.

43:22.853 --> 43:24.479
There you go. Now we're even.

43:25.814 --> 43:28.817
No one owes anyone anything,
now that we're even.

43:33.071 --> 43:34.656
Oh, Well, it's this way.

43:37.784 --> 43:39.453
Why did I have to wear something sporty?

43:39.536 --> 43:42.414
Well, it doesn't matter, really,
'cause you didn't anyway.

43:47.085 --> 43:48.337
Shot.

43:51.131 --> 43:53.217
Well done, man.

43:54.426 --> 43:55.511
High praise, huh?

43:56.178 --> 43:57.971
It is. From Naill anyway.

44:01.225 --> 44:02.601
Gonna have a go?

44:16.907 --> 44:18.492
Not really sure you tried there.

44:19.117 --> 44:23.163
Not really sure why you brought me here
on our first date.

44:24.915 --> 44:27.584
It's hard to know what to do
with a girl like yourself.

44:28.544 --> 44:30.629
It is so much easier than you think.

44:33.715 --> 44:35.551
Come on, I'm gonna teach you.

44:44.268 --> 44:47.104
So, you have to bend your knees.

44:48.939 --> 44:51.066
Never saw you do that with Cian.

44:53.026 --> 44:54.027
Who's Cian?

44:54.111 --> 44:56.446
It's just an old friend
I used to play boule with back in the day.

44:56.530 --> 44:58.031
Ran off with his girlfriend.

44:58.115 --> 44:59.700
Shut the fuck up, Naill!

45:01.785 --> 45:03.161
Sorry.

45:03.245 --> 45:04.246
Is that true?

45:04.329 --> 45:06.957
No. No, she was actually my fiancée.

45:07.040 --> 45:08.667
Shit. He was your friend?

45:08.750 --> 45:11.837
Yeah. Yeah, he was also
the lead singer of my band.

45:13.172 --> 45:15.340
He looked a lot better in skinny jeans,
in fairness.

45:16.091 --> 45:19.178
I'm sorry you lost your girl.
And your friend.

45:19.761 --> 45:22.139
Yeah, threw me off for a while.

45:23.849 --> 45:24.933
And what about now?

45:25.517 --> 45:28.187
Now? Now I'm on my guard.

45:31.690 --> 45:33.525
I think you should have another go.

46:29.206 --> 46:31.792
It's been a while since
I looked through the old family photos.

46:31.875 --> 46:35.420
You think it'd be upsetting,
but it's joyful. Yeah.

46:35.504 --> 46:36.964
All those memories.

46:38.340 --> 46:39.716
Dad's rockabilly hair.

46:39.800 --> 46:41.468
I know! Huh?

46:41.552 --> 46:43.971
Oh, God, her pointy tits.

46:44.054 --> 46:45.472
They were a lovely couple.

46:46.098 --> 46:48.642
Of tits?

46:49.560 --> 46:51.395
I'm sorry you lost some of your photos.

46:52.896 --> 46:57.067
Made me think of that one you've got
of Mom and Dad at the Forty Foot.

46:57.150 --> 46:58.944
We should get copies made of that,
you know,

46:59.027 --> 47:01.655
just in case something happens,
for all of us.

47:01.738 --> 47:04.741
That's a lovely idea.
Do you think you'll be able to restore it?

47:05.325 --> 47:08.787
- Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
- Brilliant. Okay, look, I'll go grab it.

47:08.871 --> 47:11.164
- Okay. All right.
- And I'll be back in a minute.

47:41.695 --> 47:44.781
I spilled some of the--
some of the tea.

47:46.325 --> 47:47.326
- Here.
- Yeah, give me.

47:47.409 --> 47:48.827
I'll grab a cloth.

47:49.870 --> 47:51.622
It's a nice thing you're doing.

47:51.705 --> 47:52.915
Yeah, I hope so.

47:56.126 --> 47:58.462
Look at you. Boobless.

48:01.965 --> 48:04.510
I may have been a late developer.

48:07.346 --> 48:08.347
I love you.

48:11.225 --> 48:12.226
Love you too.

48:59.731 --> 49:02.776
Hey, honey. I'm just in the middle of
supper here. Can I call you back?

49:02.860 --> 49:06.029
Oh, you are?
I was just thinking about you.

49:06.113 --> 49:07.823
That's sweet.

49:07.906 --> 49:09.157
<i>Yeah.</i>

49:09.241 --> 49:12.786
I was just-- Well, I was just wondering--
I was just wondering how-- how you are.

49:12.870 --> 49:14.830
I'm grand. Why?

49:14.913 --> 49:16.832
No-- No-- No reason. I was just--

49:16.915 --> 49:19.376
Oh, honey, look, I have to go.
I'm boiling over here.

49:19.459 --> 49:20.836
Okay. I-- I love you!

49:20.919 --> 49:22.129
Call you back. Bye.

49:23.672 --> 49:26.425
Mom? Mom.

49:33.223 --> 49:34.558
God's sake.

50:22.814 --> 50:24.399
Urs, we haven't heard from Grace.

50:24.483 --> 50:25.984
<i>I haven't either.</i>

50:26.068 --> 50:27.819
<i>Jesus Christ, I'm going out of my mind.</i>

50:27.903 --> 50:30.531
<i>Will you come over?
Everybody's left now.</i>

50:30.614 --> 50:31.615
We're on our way.

50:32.199 --> 50:33.367
Put the kettle on.

50:43.669 --> 50:45.462
- Would've worked by now, right?
- Yeah.

50:47.214 --> 50:48.799
Oh, shit.

50:50.676 --> 50:52.427
I can-- I can't answer it. I can't.

50:52.511 --> 50:53.679
No, I can't. No.

50:54.429 --> 50:55.722
No, don't. Don't fucking--

50:58.350 --> 50:59.351
Hey, honey.

51:00.310 --> 51:02.896
He's dead, Eva.

51:04.481 --> 51:05.649
<i>He's dead.</i>

51:07.401 --> 51:10.320
Just-- Te--
Just tell me what happened, Grace.

51:10.404 --> 51:14.408
He didn't wake up this morning.
Heart failure in his sleep.

51:14.491 --> 51:16.368
Oh, God.

51:17.452 --> 51:19.413
Well-- Well, at-at least, you know it--

51:19.496 --> 51:21.373
<i>This is just awful.</i>

51:21.456 --> 51:23.917
I keep thinking maybe it's--

51:24.001 --> 51:26.170
it's best this way, you know?
He was getting on.

51:27.838 --> 51:30.048
<i>We're gonna bury him
in the garden this afternoon.</i>

51:30.132 --> 51:31.633
In the garden?

51:31.717 --> 51:32.968
Is Bibi there?

51:33.051 --> 51:35.596
Yeah. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, she--

51:35.679 --> 51:37.055
Oh, my God, it's Oscar.

51:38.557 --> 51:40.559
<i>He was such a good dog.</i>

51:40.642 --> 51:44.605
Such a gentle soul.

51:44.688 --> 51:46.732
- Oh, no, no, no. No.
- Oh, my God.

51:47.482 --> 51:49.067
Poor Blanaid.

51:49.151 --> 51:50.485
Oh, God.

51:52.154 --> 51:53.614
Well, look it's…

51:53.697 --> 51:55.115
No.

51:58.285 --> 51:59.453
Oh, Gracie.

52:05.000 --> 52:08.629
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:11.381 --> 52:13.091
Yeah, it's all right.

52:28.232 --> 52:29.733
Can you just drop me here?

52:29.816 --> 52:32.110
- What's that?
- Can you just let me off here?

52:40.786 --> 52:43.038
What's so special about here?

52:43.121 --> 52:44.706
That was gonna be mine.

52:46.834 --> 52:50.254
First floor of that building there?
My first business.

52:52.714 --> 52:53.757
Sorry.

52:56.218 --> 52:57.970
It just winded me, seeing it.

53:00.597 --> 53:01.682
What happened?

53:05.018 --> 53:10.941
You know, I had no money, and a
family member was supposed to help me out.

53:11.942 --> 53:13.443
Sort of landed me in it.

53:16.405 --> 53:17.489
I lost money.

53:19.408 --> 53:21.243
Lost my confidence, I think.

53:22.286 --> 53:23.829
I had a lot of big plans.

53:24.621 --> 53:26.665
Don't know where they're gone now.

53:35.424 --> 53:37.092
I don't think
those insurance twats

53:37.176 --> 53:38.927
are gonna stop
until they get what they want.

53:39.011 --> 53:40.012
Move.

53:41.847 --> 53:44.516
They went to the hotel
me and Ben used to meet at.

53:44.600 --> 53:45.893
Jesus.

53:45.976 --> 53:47.811
They thought John Paul
and I were having an affair.

53:49.354 --> 53:50.355
How is that funny?

53:52.191 --> 53:55.235
Sorry, it's not.
It's-- It's a horrible image.

53:55.861 --> 53:59.156
I'm pretty sure that ginger one
went through my medicine cabinet.

53:59.239 --> 54:01.325
They better not try that shit on me.

54:01.408 --> 54:02.993
Jesus Christ,
this is making me so stressed.

54:03.076 --> 54:04.077
Why?

54:06.163 --> 54:08.540
Seriously, what have they got? Really?

54:09.791 --> 54:11.835
They're so wide off the mark.

54:12.836 --> 54:14.922
We just have to keep
checking in with each other.

54:15.756 --> 54:18.717
Okay? Backing each other's stories,
playing it safe.

54:19.760 --> 54:21.386
And we'll be fine.

54:28.685 --> 54:30.521
As long as Becka keeps her mouth shut.
