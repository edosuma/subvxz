00:17.367 --> 00:20.677
Oh, how does he always hear me?

00:20.677 --> 00:21.312
He doesn't.

00:21.312 --> 00:23.231
He just swings through every twenty minutes.

00:23.231 --> 00:26.801
He knows you'll be eating some kind of junk.

00:26.801 --> 00:27.929
Well, I don't want him eating these.

00:27.929 --> 00:30.513
Well, then do what I do when
I want Eddie away from me.

00:30.513 --> 00:31.626
I make a sound like

00:31.626 --> 00:40.905
La la la la la la la la la la la!

00:40.905 --> 00:42.197
That's mean!

00:42.197 --> 00:44.248
Why?  It doesn't really hurt his ears.

00:44.248 --> 00:47.658
He just finds certain noises irritating.

00:58.804 --> 01:04.141
That was the most riveting production
of Wagner I have seen this season.

01:04.141 --> 01:08.215
I still have goose bumps from when Klingsor
summoned Kundry with

01:08.215 --> 01:11.430
a terrible cry and ordered her
to seduce Parsifal:

01:11.430 --> 01:17.142
"Ha! Er Ist Shun Der Knabe!"

01:17.142 --> 01:19.046
Well, I had a pretty good night too.

01:19.046 --> 01:21.503
Took myself a nice, hot bath.

01:21.503 --> 01:24.462
And, remember that corn I had on my toe?

01:24.462 --> 01:30.952
Well, it got so soft I was just
able to peel it right off.

01:30.952 --> 01:33.080
Um... it's going to be difficult
for me to top that,

01:33.080 --> 01:35.924
but I have some rather exciting news myself.

01:35.924 --> 01:38.972
I'm sure you're all familiar with
the Safford case that's been in the papers recently?

01:38.972 --> 01:42.942
Oh, you mean that scum-sucking jerk
who's trying to get his father committed?

01:42.942 --> 01:48.144
Yes.  Well, guess who's been retained
by that scum-sucking jerk!

01:48.144 --> 01:51.808
I'm going to be testifying as an expert
witness at Mr. Safford's capacity hearing.

01:51.808 --> 01:52.463
Wait a minute.

01:52.463 --> 01:55.342
You're gonna help sell that poor
old guy down the river?

01:55.342 --> 01:56.334
Not at all.

01:56.334 --> 01:57.895
Mr. Safford is unbalanced.

01:57.895 --> 01:59.460
His son is worried sick about him.

01:59.460 --> 02:03.357
Oh, his son's worried he's not gonna
get his hands on his father's fortune.

02:03.357 --> 02:07.693
Boy, the minute a man starts getting
up there his kids start making plans to

02:07.693 --> 02:09.053
divvy up his stuff.

02:09.053 --> 02:11.176
Dad, you'll be pleased to know that Niles
and I have decided to give

02:11.176 --> 02:13.214
all your things to charity.

02:13.214 --> 02:17.935
We're donating your clothes to the blind.

02:20.660 --> 02:22.068
Well, it's just not right.

02:22.068 --> 02:27.559
A bunch of moneygrubbers behind closed
doors trying to declare this poor old guy insane.

02:27.559 --> 02:29.877
For starters, it's not behind closed doors.

02:29.877 --> 02:32.820
The entire proceeding will be broadcast on Court TV.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.413
Oh, great.

02:34.413 --> 02:37.973
What father doesn't look forward to
the day he gathers his friends around the TV and says,

02:37.973 --> 02:43.066
"Hey, that's my boy. The one making
the old man cry."

02:43.066 --> 02:46.637
Dad, I'm sure Niles is only doing
this to protect Mr. Safford from himself.

02:46.637 --> 02:48.910
Old age doesn't have to be that way, you know.

02:48.910 --> 02:51.581
My great-aunt Beryl lived well into her nineties,

02:51.581 --> 02:54.060
and her mind never failed her.

02:54.060 --> 02:56.686
Of course, she lost her eyesight in her seventies,

02:56.686 --> 02:59.061
and her balance in her eighties.

02:59.061 --> 03:01.308
By the end we spent most of our
time propping her up or

03:01.308 --> 03:04.590
putting another bandage on her forehead.

03:04.590 --> 03:11.707
Oh, but bless her heart, she could
always tell you just how it happened.

03:11.707 --> 03:14.694
Well, Safford is clearly irrational.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.130
Recently, he wandered off.

03:16.130 --> 03:21.206
They found him two days later riding
across Wyoming in a boxcar full of bums;

03:21.206 --> 03:23.718
he's taken to selling off property
for half its worth;

03:23.718 --> 03:26.771
and most damning of all, when I went
over to evaluate him,

03:26.771 --> 03:30.949
he continually referred to me as "Sparky."

03:30.949 --> 03:34.291
I don't know, Niles, you always wanted
to have a nickname.

03:34.291 --> 03:36.594
You remember your campaign to have
the string section

03:36.594 --> 03:39.971
of the youth orchestra call you "Rocky?"

03:39.971 --> 03:42.412
It would have worked, too, if Tilly
Farraday hadn't pinned me

03:42.412 --> 03:47.850
to the ground with her trombone when
I rebuked her for neglecting to clean her spit valve.

03:47.850 --> 03:51.154
Well, I still think picking on
the old man stinks.

03:51.154 --> 03:54.593
God help you if you're over fifty
and you do anything that

03:54.593 --> 03:56.980
seems the least bit odd to your family.

04:12.179 --> 04:15.075
And I'm pretty sure he's having an
affair with his secretary.

04:15.075 --> 04:18.776
Well, have you talked to your husband
and heard his side of the story?

04:18.776 --> 04:19.522
No.

04:19.522 --> 04:22.347
Well, Beth, it does seem that your
fears may be well-founded,

04:22.347 --> 04:24.836
but I still think you should talk
to your husband before

04:24.836 --> 04:27.811
you come to any final conclusions.

04:27.811 --> 04:35.800
This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing
you good day, and good mental health.

04:35.800 --> 04:38.272
Here are those PSAs, we'll do them
tomorrow before the show.

04:38.272 --> 04:42.420
Thank you, Roz.

04:42.420 --> 04:44.570
Roz, why is that light still on?

04:44.570 --> 04:46.276
Is that Beth who I was talking to?

04:46.276 --> 04:47.236
No!

04:47.236 --> 04:47.788
Yes, it is!

04:47.788 --> 04:48.259
No, it isn't!

04:48.259 --> 04:48.659
Yes, it is!

04:48.659 --> 04:50.639
It is not!

04:50.639 --> 04:51.325
Have you been talking to Beth?

04:51.325 --> 04:52.927
Of course not!

04:52.927 --> 04:55.445
What do you think - I'm giving
advice to your callers?

04:55.445 --> 04:57.607
Oh, Frasier, you are so paranoid.

04:57.607 --> 04:59.431
The world is full of enemies.

04:59.431 --> 05:01.093
Everybody's plotting against you.

05:01.093 --> 05:02.971
There's a man in a dark trench coat
right behind you.

05:02.971 --> 05:05.358
Ho-ho, very droll.

05:05.358 --> 05:09.270
Dr. Crane?

05:09.270 --> 05:10.038
I'm John Giroux.

05:10.038 --> 05:12.405
I work for Harlow Safford.

05:12.405 --> 05:14.053
Oh, Mr. Giroux, I'm afraid there's
been some mistake.

05:14.053 --> 05:15.820
It's my brother who's connected with the case.

05:15.820 --> 05:17.941
Oh, we're quite aware of that,
but Mr. Safford feels

05:17.941 --> 05:20.092
he's the victim of a grave injustice.

05:20.092 --> 05:23.132
He's an ardent fan of your show and
feels you're the only man who can help him.

05:23.132 --> 05:25.844
Well, that's very flattering, but
given my brother's connection with the case,

05:25.844 --> 05:27.814
it wouldn't be very prudent
for me to get involved.

05:27.814 --> 05:31.396
Won't you at least talk to my client?
Judge him by his words and his actions,

05:31.396 --> 05:33.861
not by how old he is?

05:33.861 --> 05:40.917
You sound like my father - a man who
believes that burial is a form of age discrimination.

05:40.917 --> 05:42.113
If you stop by this evening,

05:42.113 --> 05:45.230
I'm convinced you'll find Mr. Safford
is completely competent.

05:45.230 --> 05:48.229
Even if you won't testify on his behalf,
perhaps you could at least get your brother

05:48.229 --> 05:50.078
to reconsider his testimony.

05:50.078 --> 05:53.554
It's highly unlikely that I would
disagree with my brother's opinion.

05:53.554 --> 05:56.213
I really admired your advice to that
last caller - you know,

05:56.213 --> 06:01.826
about not judging someone until you've
heard his side of the story?

06:01.826 --> 06:03.933
You're a good lawyer, Mr. Giroux.

06:03.933 --> 06:07.740
Mr. Safford only seeks out the very best.

06:07.740 --> 06:09.026
I'll see you at seven?

06:09.026 --> 06:11.141
The address is on the back of my card.

06:20.986 --> 06:22.476
I don't care what Dr. Crane said.

06:22.476 --> 06:25.941
You start talking to your husband 
and he'll start covering his tracks.

06:25.941 --> 06:36.211
Get a detective now.

06:36.211 --> 06:38.619
You were talking to my last caller.

06:38.619 --> 06:40.772
I swear; it's the first and last time.

06:40.772 --> 06:44.197
I will never do it again.

06:44.197 --> 06:51.836
I hope not.

06:51.836 --> 06:54.747
Thanks for holding, Bill.  I'm listening.

06:59.784 --> 07:01.114
Enjoy your tour?

07:01.114 --> 07:04.111
Uh... yes, yes.

07:04.111 --> 07:08.504
That's quite a model railroad Mr. Safford
has running through the grounds.

07:08.504 --> 07:10.849
I've never seen one on quite that scale.

07:10.849 --> 07:11.787
Impressive, isn't it?

07:11.787 --> 07:12.607
Oh, yes.  Yes,

07:12.607 --> 07:15.522
especially when it's bearing down on you.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.434
I got my heels stuck in the soft grass.

07:17.434 --> 07:20.792
I barely made the crossing.

07:20.792 --> 07:26.655
Tell me, how often does
Mr. Safford... play with his train?

07:26.655 --> 07:31.637
Just the weekends, when he gives rides
to underprivileged children.

07:31.637 --> 07:33.400
Very admirable.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.281
There's a lot you don't know about him, Dr. Crane.

07:35.281 --> 07:36.241
That's why you're here.

07:36.241 --> 07:45.553
Yes, well, I promise to consider
all the evidence before I arrive at a conclusion.

07:45.553 --> 07:48.193
I think I've arrived.

07:48.193 --> 07:49.330
Hiya, Sparky.

07:49.330 --> 07:50.944
I'm Harlow Safford.

07:50.944 --> 07:53.179
Dr. Frasier Crane.

07:53.179 --> 07:56.127
I don't believe I've ever seen
a fire pole in a home before.

07:56.127 --> 07:58.443
Oh, it saves a lot of time.

07:58.443 --> 08:01.800
Except for going up, of course.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.360
And, uh, the hat?

08:03.360 --> 08:06.010
Oh, it's just for laughs.

08:06.010 --> 08:06.833
Oh, try it on.

08:06.833 --> 08:07.602
Well, no, I don't think I should.

08:07.602 --> 08:13.599
Oh, come on!

08:13.599 --> 08:16.146
I guess it is sort of fun, isn't it?

08:16.146 --> 08:19.992
Not on you.

08:19.992 --> 08:24.239
So, do you think you can convince
my self-righteous son that I'm not nuts?

08:24.239 --> 08:26.793
Oh, I think "nuts" is a little strong.

08:26.793 --> 08:28.666
He must have meant that your behavior might seem to

08:28.666 --> 08:30.607
most people to be a little unconventional.

08:30.607 --> 08:31.670
Well, good.

08:31.670 --> 08:34.450
I've spent my whole life being conventional.

08:34.450 --> 08:40.352
Then one day I said to myself, 
"Harlow, you're not having any fun."

08:40.352 --> 08:44.943
Do you... speak to yourself often?

08:44.943 --> 08:46.983
Don't try to trip me up, Sparky.

08:46.983 --> 08:47.688
Oh, no, thank you.

08:47.688 --> 08:50.273
Thank you, I'm trying to cut down on...

08:50.273 --> 08:55.374
lollipops.  Thank you.

08:55.374 --> 08:58.305
But tell me, why do you call people "Sparky"?

08:58.305 --> 09:02.506
It makes them smile.  Right, Sparky?

09:02.506 --> 09:03.895
You ought to try it with your patients.

09:03.895 --> 09:13.577
Oh, I'm not too sure how warmly
that would be embraced by those
undergoing electroshock.

09:13.577 --> 09:20.601
Um, anyway, your son tells me that
you recently sold some property at a
fraction of its value.

09:20.601 --> 09:21.745
That's right.

09:21.745 --> 09:25.431
Terrific young married couple had
their hearts set on it, but couldn't afford it.

09:25.431 --> 09:27.246
So, I helped them out.

09:27.246 --> 09:29.429
There's nothing wrong with helping people.

09:29.429 --> 09:34.670
Well, he also informed me that you
recently indulged in an unorthodox,

09:34.670 --> 09:38.015
not to mention hazardous mode of travel.

09:38.015 --> 09:39.528
That pompous weenie.

09:39.528 --> 09:41.349
That's exactly how he would put it.

09:41.349 --> 09:44.597
Well, actually, that was my wording.

09:44.597 --> 09:46.668
Well, I hopped a freight.

09:46.668 --> 09:47.710
Rode the rails.

09:47.710 --> 09:51.037
Well, why not just purchase a ticket
and ride in a club car?

09:51.037 --> 09:52.743
Where's the adventure in that?

09:52.743 --> 09:53.692
I'm 78.

09:53.692 --> 09:58.349
Someday I'll be too old to jump off
a moving train!

09:58.349 --> 10:00.656
No, you gotta live out your fantasies
while you can.

10:00.656 --> 10:04.101
Can you understand that?

10:04.101 --> 10:07.086
I think I can.

10:07.086 --> 10:12.220
Mr. Safford, what you've said makes
a great deal of sense.

10:12.220 --> 10:18.030
Before we go on, there's something
I have to ask you.

10:18.030 --> 10:20.119
Shoot.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.023
It's a little embarrassing.

10:22.023 --> 10:23.997
I can take it.

10:23.997 --> 10:30.684
Okay.  Can I slide down that pole?

10:30.684 --> 10:32.596
Follow me, Sparky!

10:36.094 --> 10:37.734
Dad, are you going to watch something now?

10:37.734 --> 10:39.742
Yeah, the championship fight.

10:39.742 --> 10:42.915
But don't worry, I'm using my earphones,
I won't bother anyone.

10:42.915 --> 10:47.398
Oh, you've already been a bother
- making me hide the sports section
so he won't see it.

10:47.398 --> 10:50.581
Making me turn the news off because
they might say who won.

10:50.581 --> 10:51.734
I don't understand.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.364
Well, the fight was last night.

10:53.364 --> 10:55.091
It was on Pay TV.

10:55.091 --> 10:57.583
But one of my police buddies has
a pirate antenna.

10:57.583 --> 11:03.708
So, he taped it and they messengered
one to me in an envelope marked "Official Business."

11:03.708 --> 11:09.646
Another inspiring tale of our men
in law enforcement.

11:09.646 --> 11:11.095
Why are you walking funny?

11:11.095 --> 11:15.046
Well, suffice it to say I learned today
it is unwise to slide repeatedly down

11:15.046 --> 11:21.206
a fire pole wearing woolen trousers.

11:21.206 --> 11:22.148
Daphne, would you...?

11:22.148 --> 11:26.964
Oh, I'll get it.

11:26.964 --> 11:28.005
Evening, Daphne.

11:28.005 --> 11:31.628
Oh, Dr. Crane, don't say anything
about last night's boxing match.

11:31.628 --> 11:33.622
Your dad hasn't seen it yet.

11:33.622 --> 11:44.954
Oh, I didn't even know it was boxing season.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.706
Well, did everyone see my mention
in this morning's paper?

11:47.706 --> 11:48.603
No, I'm afraid I missed that.

11:48.603 --> 11:50.522
Well, small wonder.

11:50.522 --> 11:53.092
They buried it all the way back on page 32.

11:53.092 --> 11:54.900
It's here, it's next to the sports section.

11:54.900 --> 11:59.805
Hey, get that out of here!

11:59.805 --> 12:00.620
Let me see.

12:00.620 --> 12:01.077
It's right there.

12:01.077 --> 12:02.092
Oh.

12:02.092 --> 12:05.996
"Court TV this week will feature
the capacity hearing of noted

12:05.996 --> 12:08.244
timber baron Harlow Safford. [

12:08.244 --> 12:12.251
Testifying on behalf of the family
will be Dr. Niles Crane,

12:12.251 --> 12:17.860
eminent psychiatrist, author and
leading authority on clinical psychosis.

12:17.860 --> 12:19.691
Dr. Crane is also the brother of..."

12:19.691 --> 12:24.393
Yadda-yadda, the rest is filler.

12:24.393 --> 12:28.844
Niles, I have to talk to you about something.

12:28.844 --> 12:33.307
Just after the show today I was
visited by a man named Mr. Giroux.

12:33.307 --> 12:36.149
He asked me to represent Mr. Safford.

12:36.149 --> 12:37.036
What?!

12:37.036 --> 12:39.660
Shh!

12:39.660 --> 12:40.473
I'm sorry.

12:40.473 --> 12:42.658
Given your involvement with the case,
I naturally declined.

12:42.658 --> 12:43.953
Oh, thank God.

12:43.953 --> 12:48.617
But, I did agree to see if I concurred
with your analysis and speak to Mr. Safford.

12:48.617 --> 12:49.556
What?!

12:49.556 --> 12:51.952
Hey, keep it down!

12:51.952 --> 12:57.321
I just have to tell you that I found
Harlow Safford to be of completely sound mind -

12:57.321 --> 12:59.507
and don't say "What?!"

12:59.507 --> 13:00.185
Why?!

13:00.185 --> 13:04.272
Quiet!!

13:04.272 --> 13:07.256
Perhaps it'd be better if we spoke
somewhere else.

13:11.812 --> 13:14.121
You couldn't stand that I had a
high-profile case, could you?

13:14.121 --> 13:15.476
So you had to butt into it!

13:15.476 --> 13:16.843
I just don't want you to make a fool of yourself.

13:16.843 --> 13:18.969
These people came to me, they
asked for my expertise.

13:18.969 --> 13:22.929
Oh, ha!  They were undoubtedly
exploiting your dubious celebrity.

13:22.929 --> 13:26.232
Of which you are jealous and, I fear,
the reason you took this case!

13:26.232 --> 13:27.689
That is flatly untrue!

13:27.689 --> 13:29.100
I took the case to help the family!

13:29.100 --> 13:30.179
And to be on television!

13:30.179 --> 13:31.737
I don't give a hoot about television!

13:31.737 --> 13:38.083
Well, some of us do!!

13:38.083 --> 13:41.664
Niles, you made a hasty judgment
and I am sorry, but you were wrong.

13:41.664 --> 13:44.184
Ah, now we see why you got involved in the case -

13:44.184 --> 13:47.358
so big brother could be right and
little Niles could be wrong, which I'm not!

13:47.358 --> 13:51.124
Oh, your pathetic childhood issues
have nothing to do with it.

13:51.124 --> 13:53.880
Face it, you were wrong!  Wrong, wrong, wrong!

13:53.880 --> 13:58.458
Oh, oh, oh-!

13:58.458 --> 14:03.122
This from Mr. Quick-Fix, the master
of the in-depth, one-minute phone call diagnosis!

14:03.122 --> 14:05.738
I spent several hours with Mr. Safford 
and I found his behavior to be...

14:05.738 --> 14:06.752
Wildly irrational.

14:06.752 --> 14:07.978
He's a lip-diddling loon!

14:07.978 --> 14:11.018
You think anything that's even slightly
spontaneous is aberrant.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.147
That's ridiculous!

14:12.147 --> 14:13.745
The man's incompetent!

14:13.745 --> 14:15.402
Niles, I'm warning you.

14:15.402 --> 14:18.898
If you get up in that courtroom and
say that, you will damage yourself professionally!

14:18.898 --> 14:21.041
I'm testifying, and you're not going to stop me!

14:21.041 --> 14:23.672
Fine, then you leave me no choice
but to testify against you!

14:23.672 --> 14:25.335
Well, in that case, I'll see you in court!

14:25.335 --> 14:26.406
Good, I look forward to it!

14:26.406 --> 14:27.017
So do I!

14:27.017 --> 14:27.490
Good!

14:27.490 --> 14:28.216
Good!

14:28.216 --> 14:31.210
HEY!!

14:31.210 --> 14:33.574
Daphne, please.  Turn down that radio.

14:33.574 --> 14:36.541
Dad is trying to watch a fight!

14:41.831 --> 14:42.953
So, how are you holding up?

14:42.953 --> 14:45.703
Oh, I'm fine.  Now look, Sparky.

14:45.703 --> 14:48.166
I know you don't want to take any
money for helping me.

14:48.166 --> 14:51.831
But at least let me make a donation
to your favorite charity.

14:51.831 --> 14:57.813
Well... it was my duty, not to 
mention a pleasure, to help you.

14:57.813 --> 15:02.841
But if you'd like to donate something,
why don't youselect a charity of your own choosing?

15:02.841 --> 15:03.992
Fair enough.

15:03.992 --> 15:12.576
Good.  Excuse me.

15:12.576 --> 15:14.145
Hello, Niles.

15:14.145 --> 15:16.437
You know, it's not to late to ask 
them to put a big blue ball in front of

15:16.437 --> 15:19.976
your face during the broadcast.

15:19.976 --> 15:23.733
Perhaps spare you some shred of your reputation.

15:23.733 --> 15:28.598
I'd laugh in your face but I'm saving my voice.

15:28.598 --> 15:33.604
Oh my God!  You're wearing makeup!

15:33.604 --> 15:34.940
I am not!

15:34.940 --> 15:38.277
This is... medication.

15:38.277 --> 15:40.565
Something my dermatologist recommended.

15:40.565 --> 15:45.614
Dr. Revlon?

15:45.614 --> 15:48.910
These feeble attempts to undermine
my confidence are futile.

15:48.910 --> 15:51.572
The testimony I've prepared is
nothing short of brilliant.

15:51.572 --> 15:53.484
I cite half a dozen studies of gerontology.

15:53.484 --> 15:55.926
I quote everything from the Bible to Herodotus.

15:55.926 --> 15:58.044
I deftly interweave humor with pathos.

15:58.044 --> 16:01.094
You may want to take notes.

16:01.094 --> 16:04.483
And if you had an ounce of self-awareness
you would realize

16:04.483 --> 16:10.897
that your diagnosis was colored by
your zeal to put your face in front of that camera.

16:10.897 --> 16:12.515
Oh, by the way,

16:12.515 --> 16:20.879
your medication is rubbing off on your collar.

16:20.879 --> 16:22.102
All rise.

16:22.102 --> 16:22.708
Court is in session.

16:22.708 --> 16:24.645
Judge Richard McCarron presiding.

16:24.645 --> 16:28.415
Hello, your honor.

16:28.415 --> 16:30.302
Be seated.

16:30.302 --> 16:31.651
Good morning.

16:31.651 --> 16:32.991
Has everyone been sworn in?

16:32.991 --> 16:34.606
Yes, your honor.

16:34.606 --> 16:40.462
Well, I see we have two Dr. Cranes testifying today.

16:40.462 --> 16:46.510
Mr. Giroux, I think we'll hear from 
your authority first.

16:46.510 --> 16:50.892
I assume the other Dr. Crane has no
objection to that arrangement?

16:50.892 --> 16:53.402
None whatsoever, your honor.

16:53.402 --> 16:56.926
I'm over here, Dr. Crane.

16:56.926 --> 16:59.597
Your honor, I would not presume to bore the court with a

16:59.597 --> 17:09.268
recitation of dry statistics,
gerontology studies, obscure literary references.

17:09.268 --> 17:15.714
Instead, I intend to speak from the heart.

17:15.714 --> 17:19.560
I worry about a society that has
chosen to define normalcy in such narrow

17:19.560 --> 17:23.445
terms that if someone's behavior
deviates ever so slightly,

17:23.445 --> 17:27.567
we question his capacity to function.

17:27.567 --> 17:32.536
Mr. Safford's seeming eccentricities -
his love of trains, his generosity -

17:32.536 --> 17:34.302
they can all be readily explained.

17:34.302 --> 17:36.655
Diabetes!

17:36.655 --> 17:37.889
Mr. Safford?

17:37.889 --> 17:42.629
I was talking to Sparky.

17:42.629 --> 17:43.910
Uh... Did you say diabetes?

17:43.910 --> 17:46.966
Yes.  We'll donate the money to diabetes.

17:46.966 --> 17:49.887
Those poor people can't eat sugar!

17:49.887 --> 17:51.310
Fine.. fine.

17:51.310 --> 17:52.985
Uh... we'll, uh... we'll talk
about it afterwards.

17:52.985 --> 17:55.855
May we continue, Dr. Crane?

17:55.855 --> 17:57.071
My apologies, your honor.

17:57.071 --> 17:59.824
Mr. Safford and I were discussing
a very sizable donation he intends

17:59.824 --> 18:03.800
to make later today to a very worthy cause.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.184
I guess his enthusiasm just got the best of him.

18:05.184 --> 18:09.902
But, it is this very generosity that
his son finds so objectionable.

18:09.902 --> 18:14.623
That, and the fact that he did hop
a freight train across the country.

18:14.623 --> 18:22.117
But, you see, what he sees as unstable,
I see as... romantic.

18:22.117 --> 18:26.653
I... I don't suppose there's a railroad
track outside the courtroom?

18:34.803 --> 18:38.998
Uh... doesn't Mr. Safford deserve to be
a bit of a free spirit

18:38.998 --> 18:42.182
after the years of his demanding career?

18:42.182 --> 18:46.325
A career in which he wore...

18:46.325 --> 18:50.981
many hats.

18:50.981 --> 18:55.308
Um... the hat of a father,
a philanthropist, a C.E.O...

18:55.308 --> 18:57.045
All aboard!  All aboard!

18:57.045 --> 18:58.580
Get your tickets ready.

18:58.580 --> 19:00.095
Have your tickets ready, please.

19:00.095 --> 19:01.997
Have your tickets ready.

19:01.997 --> 19:03.278
In the end, it all comes down to this:

19:03.278 --> 19:06.310
can we really condemn a man for maintaining a childlike

19:06.310 --> 19:10.196
joie de vivre even in his twilight years?

19:10.196 --> 19:12.230
All aboard for the Coast Express.

19:12.230 --> 19:16.421
Yes, making stops in Tacoma, Olympia,
Portland and Salem.

19:16.421 --> 19:17.706
And the next stop is...

19:17.706 --> 19:20.491
I think I know where your next stop is going to be.

19:31.267 --> 19:35.946
Now, look, Niles.  Before you start
gloating, let me just say this.

19:35.946 --> 19:38.013
You were right, I was wrong.

19:38.013 --> 19:39.972
Big deal.

19:39.972 --> 19:43.739
The world never got a chance to hear me be right.

19:43.739 --> 19:46.636
I suppose by now it's obvious that
what you were saying all along was true.

19:46.636 --> 19:49.805
I do... envy your fame.

19:49.805 --> 19:54.177
Well, perhaps this public humiliation
will cure me of my damned competitiveness.

19:54.177 --> 19:58.042
Oh, don't worry about it.

19:58.042 --> 20:00.820
I humiliated myself far more than you did today.

20:00.820 --> 20:05.200
Obviously, you didn't see the way
I was whoring after that TV camera.

20:05.200 --> 20:09.986
Obviously, you didn't see how I was
tap dancing up there like an organ grinder's monkey.

20:09.986 --> 20:12.823
Yes, well, I might as well have been
tarred and feathered.

20:12.823 --> 20:15.010
I might as well have been pilloried
in the town square.

20:15.010 --> 20:17.240
I might as well have been stripped
naked and forced to...

20:17.240 --> 20:21.441
Oh, stop it, Niles!  We're doing it again!

20:21.441 --> 20:25.144
Niles, you have no reason to feel badly.

20:25.144 --> 20:29.607
Everyone wants to be recognized for
something they're good at.

20:29.607 --> 20:35.662
And you are a good psychiatrist.

20:35.662 --> 20:37.366
Thank you, Frasier.

20:37.366 --> 20:41.040
Something I can't really lay claim 
to after today.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.903
How could I have so misjudged that man?

20:42.903 --> 20:46.526
Well, he's undeniably charming for one thing.

20:46.526 --> 20:49.038
And he can be lucid for long stretches of time.

20:49.038 --> 20:51.068
Yes, but you weren't fooled.

20:51.068 --> 20:56.150
Somehow, you picked up on some tiny
clue that I missed.

20:56.150 --> 20:58.199
You remember what it was?

20:58.199 --> 21:01.636
Yes.  Midway through our interview
he took off his trousers

21:01.636 --> 21:07.271
and tried to put them on the cat.

21:07.271 --> 21:12.072
Well, I'd like to think that I might
have picked up on that one too.  Still...

21:12.072 --> 21:15.765
Frasier, you've always approached 
life with a positive attitude.

21:15.765 --> 21:17.904
It's a quality I admire of yours.

21:17.904 --> 21:22.189
Perhaps your judgment was clouded
by your desire to see old age not as a

21:22.189 --> 21:27.950
time of inevitable decline, but as 
a time when one's childhood passions

21:27.950 --> 21:32.277
and fantasies can be reborn.

21:32.277 --> 21:35.766
Thank you, Niles.

21:35.766 --> 21:37.095
You know what would cheer me up right now?

21:37.095 --> 21:37.883
What?

21:37.883 --> 21:40.671
I would like to hear that summation
you never got a chance to give.

21:40.671 --> 21:41.235
Really?

21:41.235 --> 21:41.751
Yes.

21:41.751 --> 21:42.607
You're not just saying that?

21:42.607 --> 21:43.307
Do you care?

21:43.307 --> 21:43.918
No!

21:43.918 --> 21:46.908
Well, all right then.

21:46.908 --> 21:48.132
I'm the judge!  I'm the judge!

21:48.132 --> 21:49.372
Okay, you be the judge.

21:49.372 --> 21:50.402
All rise.

21:50.402 --> 21:50.960
Yes, here we are.

21:50.960 --> 21:51.797
Have we been sworn in?

21:51.797 --> 21:56.446
Yes we have, your honor.

21:56.446 --> 21:57.822
Dr. Crane, proceed.

21:57.822 --> 22:00.403
Your honor, I believe it was Herodotus who said:

22:00.403 --> 22:06.427
"Circumstances rule men.
Men do not rule circumstances."
