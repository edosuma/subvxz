WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:07.166
- What the hell
was that?

00:07.250 --> 00:09.416
- Oh, no. Mom?
- Mom?

00:09.500 --> 00:11.041
- Mom. Mom!

00:11.125 --> 00:13.583
- Camila!

00:16.958 --> 00:19.500
I can't believe Mom
just left like that.

00:19.583 --> 00:21.458
What is going on with her?

00:21.541 --> 00:24.791
Alma, what have you done?

00:24.875 --> 00:26.875
The world's falling apart.

00:28.250 --> 00:31.291
Aah!

00:31.375 --> 00:33.416
- Whoa.

00:33.541 --> 00:35.000
Why are we here?

00:35.041 --> 00:36.791
Becca, are you doing this?

00:36.875 --> 00:38.166
No.
I don't know what this is.

00:38.250 --> 00:40.000
This isn't my memory.

00:40.083 --> 00:42.333
I've never been outside
of my own memories before.

00:46.875 --> 00:49.458
Wait. Dad?

00:49.541 --> 00:51.750
There's so much sadness.

00:51.833 --> 00:53.791
Just let the feelings
wash over you. It's okay.

00:55.250 --> 00:56.375
You got to us out of here.
Right now!

00:56.458 --> 00:57.833
- Becca?

00:57.916 --> 00:59.458
- Right now!
- Becca.

00:59.541 --> 01:01.208
Shit! Aah!

01:07.833 --> 01:09.625
You're okay.

01:11.083 --> 01:13.375
Dad, was that your memory?

01:13.458 --> 01:14.791
No.

01:14.875 --> 01:17.416
That wasn't his memory.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.250
You just tapped into
Dad's fears

01:19.333 --> 01:22.458
- of Mom leaving him.
- It felt so real.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.083
Becca...

01:25.166 --> 01:28.625
these visions--
they can be exciting, but

01:28.708 --> 01:32.083
they can also be overwhelming
in ways you first don't realize,

01:32.166 --> 01:34.416
so I-I'd encourage
you to leave them alone.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.833
- Okay, I'll try.
- So what do we do
about Mom?

01:36.916 --> 01:40.083
Whatever your mother's going
through, that's her problem.

01:40.166 --> 01:41.958
Your problem is finishing
your dissertation.

01:42.041 --> 01:43.458
Dad, come on.

01:43.541 --> 01:45.541
We have no idea where she went.
She could be in serious trouble.

01:45.625 --> 01:47.541
Okay, look,
I'll check the credit cards.

01:51.375 --> 01:55.333
Uh... W... She, uh, bought
a plane ticket to Mexico.

01:57.166 --> 01:58.583
She's going to see her family.

01:58.666 --> 02:00.208
She ran off
in the middle of the night

02:00.291 --> 02:02.166
to have a casual visit
with the fam?

02:02.250 --> 02:03.291
It looks like it.

02:03.375 --> 02:05.750
So, I want you two to go home

02:05.833 --> 02:08.875
and-and go to bed
and sober up...

02:08.916 --> 02:11.791
you boozers, all right?

02:11.875 --> 02:13.541
A-And your mother--
she'll come home

02:13.625 --> 02:16.041
when she's ready,
and everything will be fine.

02:16.125 --> 02:18.375
You'll see.

02:27.416 --> 02:30.125
I came by
to pick up some stuff.

02:31.375 --> 02:34.041
Still not sure what to believe.

02:34.125 --> 02:35.625
Wish I could trust you.

02:37.750 --> 02:39.250
Reed.

02:53.791 --> 02:56.208
Hello.
You've reached Camila Diaz.

02:56.291 --> 02:58.291
Please leave a message.

02:59.416 --> 03:01.166
- Okay, now what do I do?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.375
Hi, Mom, it's me. Um...

03:05.458 --> 03:08.250
I'm really sorry we just
barged in on you like that.

03:08.333 --> 03:11.375
We're just
really worried about you.

03:11.458 --> 03:13.958
And look, I'm gonna keep calling
until you pick up, okay?

03:14.041 --> 03:16.250
So you might as well
just pick up.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.250
Press the button.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.166
What makes you

03:30.250 --> 03:32.166
think you'll be
happy in any reality?

03:40.583 --> 03:41.541
Wake up.

03:41.625 --> 03:43.708
It's important. Come on.

03:45.541 --> 03:47.875
Well, fancy seeing you here.

03:47.958 --> 03:49.458
Okay, so, I called Mom.
She's not answering.

03:49.541 --> 03:51.833
I left a couple of messages
and now her mailbox is full.

03:51.916 --> 03:53.333
Damn. How many voice mails

03:53.416 --> 03:54.750
- did you leave?
- It doesn't matter.

03:54.833 --> 03:57.083
- Like, 27.
- Twenty...

03:57.166 --> 03:58.916
What if she broke it off
with this Alejandro guy

03:59.000 --> 04:00.416
and he's not having it,
so now she has to

04:00.500 --> 04:03.166
wire this money
to a safe house or something?

04:03.250 --> 04:05.916
Yes. Mom could be in danger.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.291
That's what I've been saying
this whole time.

04:07.375 --> 04:09.708
- Okay. So what are we gonna do?
- Well,

04:09.791 --> 04:12.208
Dad thinks that
she went to visit her family,

04:12.291 --> 04:15.166
- so let's call them
and see if she's there.
- Okay.

04:16.958 --> 04:18.750
- Saddle up, partner.

04:18.833 --> 04:20.958
Hello, my sweethearts!

04:21.041 --> 04:21.833
Who is it?

04:21.916 --> 04:23.916
Alma and Becca.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.625
Oh, I thought maybe it was
your loverboy.

04:27.708 --> 04:31.208
Ay no! Stop it!

04:31.291 --> 04:33.416
Do you have a loverboy, Grandma?

04:33.500 --> 04:38.583
Please. I have a friend I go
to church with. That is all.

04:39.416 --> 04:42.583
Okay, my angels.
I love to see you.

04:42.666 --> 04:45.083
Tell me. What is going on?

04:45.166 --> 04:47.125
We're looking for our mom.

04:47.208 --> 04:48.916
She caught a flight to Mexico
last night.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.125
We thought she might be
with you.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.750
She's in Mexico
and she didn't call?

04:54.833 --> 04:57.583
Do you have any idea
where she could be?

04:57.666 --> 04:59.625
Well, where she should be
is here.

04:59.708 --> 05:02.125
Just like you two.
You should be here.

05:02.208 --> 05:05.208
Everyone should be here with me.

05:05.291 --> 05:06.750
Could we come there?

05:06.833 --> 05:09.250
Yes! Come! Come see me!

05:09.333 --> 05:10.791
Maybe your mother is on her way.

05:10.875 --> 05:11.625
Okay.

05:11.708 --> 05:12.916
Fantastic.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.500
Goodbye my loves!

05:14.583 --> 05:16.625
- Bye. Miss you!
- Bye!

05:16.708 --> 05:18.541
Okay, we'll just go for
a couple of days, make sure

05:18.625 --> 05:21.833
Mom is okay, and then
just come right back home.

05:21.916 --> 05:24.125
I love this plan.

05:24.208 --> 05:26.833
Hey, how great is it
that we both speak Spanish?

05:26.916 --> 05:29.291
You're so weird.

05:29.375 --> 05:31.375
"Las Mañanitas"]

05:50.125 --> 05:53.791
Ayyy! I love seeing
my two granddaughters.

05:53.875 --> 05:57.916
Oh my goodness, look at you.
Are you supermodels?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.250
No, Grandma.

06:00.333 --> 06:01.791
Well, I am.

06:01.875 --> 06:03.041
Hi!

06:03.125 --> 06:04.916
Hi, Tía Monse! How are you?

06:05.000 --> 06:07.500
Alma y Becca. My goodness.

06:07.583 --> 06:10.166
The favorites
of my nieces and nephews.

06:10.250 --> 06:11.791
I am wanting to know
how you are living.

06:11.875 --> 06:14.041
I know a bar for cocktails
that is very agreeable.

06:14.125 --> 06:16.500
Ay, Tio Oscar is away on
business, but he is wanting

06:16.583 --> 06:17.875
to give you his hugs and kisses.

06:17.958 --> 06:20.708
Oh, no. We love
Tio Oscar's hugs and kisses.

06:20.791 --> 06:23.583
Yeah, they're so... friendly.

06:26.208 --> 06:30.416
Well, your mother still hasn't
responded to our calls.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.916
I don't know where she could be.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.375
She's a very private person.

06:34.458 --> 06:35.833
Lots of secrets, I think.

06:35.916 --> 06:39.666
So Becca, when is little baby
Reed or Becca coming?

06:39.750 --> 06:42.208
Oh well, we'll see!

06:42.291 --> 06:45.333
But we have something
to show you.

06:47.208 --> 06:48.416
Does this look familiar to you?

06:48.500 --> 06:50.666
We found this painting
of our mom.

06:50.750 --> 06:53.416
It's signed by someone
named Alejandro.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.333
No. We don't know any Alejandro.

06:56.416 --> 07:00.000
Except Vicente Fernández's son,
Alejandro Fernández.

07:00.083 --> 07:01.333
Who is that?

07:01.416 --> 07:03.958
He is a very famous singer.

07:04.041 --> 07:05.916
We don't really know him.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.875
His father sings ranchero
with so much beauty.

07:11.833 --> 07:13.416
Wait, wait Grandma.

07:13.500 --> 07:18.958
Do you know any old boyfriend
who our mom might be visiting?

07:19.041 --> 07:20.416
Boyfriend? No!

07:20.500 --> 07:22.416
No she does not have
an old boyfriend!

07:22.500 --> 07:24.500
Your mother has
an ex-boyfriend, but--

07:24.583 --> 07:26.625
Enough, Monse!

07:26.708 --> 07:30.333
No! We know nothing
of no boyfriends!

07:30.416 --> 07:33.291
Would you mind taking
a closer look at this?

07:33.375 --> 07:36.083
Just to make sure nothing
about it is familiar.

07:36.166 --> 07:37.541
Mm...

07:38.375 --> 07:41.750
No. Nothing.

07:41.833 --> 07:42.916
Sorry.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.916
Becca.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.541
You brought us
in Abuelita's memory.

07:58.625 --> 08:00.333
That's Mom.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.500
Something feels wrong here.

08:04.000 --> 08:04.750
Sorry.

08:04.833 --> 08:07.000
I do not know this painting.

08:07.708 --> 08:08.791
Do you understand?

08:09.833 --> 08:11.458
Are you upset, Grandma?

08:11.541 --> 08:16.166
No! I just don't want to talk
about it anymore.

08:19.083 --> 08:21.125
Okay.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.250
Hey. Look, Becca,
you made it onto

08:26.333 --> 08:27.625
the great wall of matrimony.
Congrats.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.000
Yeah.

08:29.083 --> 08:30.750
Oh.

08:30.833 --> 08:32.666
I love that picture
of Mom and Dad.

08:32.750 --> 08:34.166
Yeah.

08:34.250 --> 08:36.041
They look happy.

08:38.833 --> 08:40.666
So what do you think
Abuelita was hiding?

08:40.750 --> 08:42.708
I don't know.

08:42.791 --> 08:44.958
That vision we went into
was super weird.

08:45.041 --> 08:46.416
It's like she was

08:46.500 --> 08:48.125
- fighting it or something.
- Mm.

08:48.208 --> 08:50.916
But maybe it was just her fears,
like it was with Dad?

08:51.000 --> 08:55.375
Um... no, I think that
was definitely a real memory.

08:55.458 --> 08:56.375
Well, whatever it was,
she definitely

08:56.458 --> 08:57.791
did not want us looking there.

08:57.875 --> 08:59.583
Maybe you need to open up more.

08:59.666 --> 09:01.041
What do you mean?

09:01.125 --> 09:02.958
Look, you're
naturally empathetic.

09:03.041 --> 09:05.583
And I think when you
access someone else's memory

09:05.666 --> 09:07.458
you're taking on
all their emotions.

09:07.541 --> 09:09.333
But if you can
learn to open up beyond that

09:09.416 --> 09:12.166
and become nothing, the feelings
will flow right through you,

09:12.250 --> 09:15.166
and then maybe you can
experience a clearer truth.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.916
That totally makes sense
and sounds super easy.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.416
Just keep trying.
You'll get it.

09:19.500 --> 09:20.833
We'll talk to Abuelita again.

09:20.916 --> 09:22.291
What about Tía Monse?

09:22.375 --> 09:24.166
- What about her?
- She seemed to know something.

09:24.250 --> 09:25.583
- We could ask her.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.666
Okay. Let's start there.

09:29.333 --> 09:31.125
Oy vey, it's Dad.

09:33.625 --> 09:35.291
- Let's figure out what to say

09:35.375 --> 09:36.916
when we get back.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.125
"Quiero el Rescate"]

09:40.875 --> 09:42.666
Dos más palomas
y un whiskey.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.125
Gracias.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.958
I am having so much fun.

09:46.041 --> 09:48.541
Thank you for inviting me
to have drinks.

09:48.625 --> 09:50.958
I feel like the...
the young girl who escapes

09:51.041 --> 09:52.666
- to go to the parties.
- Oh!

09:52.750 --> 09:54.250
- That sounds like Becca.
- No. Shh.

09:54.333 --> 09:55.958
She used to sneak out
and kiss boys.

09:56.041 --> 09:59.000
No way. You are lying to me,
because Becca always

09:59.083 --> 10:01.000
- behaves like the good girl.
- Right.

10:01.083 --> 10:02.958
Alma, you're the one that
used to smoke weed in the attic.

10:04.541 --> 10:07.250
That is crazy.
Camila always acts like

10:07.333 --> 10:10.375
you are perfect little angels...

10:10.458 --> 10:12.125
- except Alma, not as much.
- No,

10:12.208 --> 10:14.416
Alma not as much.

10:14.500 --> 10:15.791
What about you, Tía?

10:15.875 --> 10:17.083
- Me?
- Yes.
- Yeah, you.

10:17.166 --> 10:18.916
Ay, ay, ay. Well,

10:19.000 --> 10:22.625
when I was in secundaria,
in school,

10:22.708 --> 10:24.708
I used to sell to the people--

10:24.791 --> 10:27.625
how do you say in English, um--

10:27.708 --> 10:28.958
cocaine.

10:29.041 --> 10:30.625
- Wha... Oh!
- Holy shit!

10:30.708 --> 10:32.833
I did not expect that. What?!

10:32.916 --> 10:35.875
No, it was the '80s. I needed
money for my good fashion.

10:35.958 --> 10:38.875
Oh, my God. Did our mom
ever do stuff like that?

10:38.958 --> 10:40.916
- Like cool, fun things?
- No.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.625
God.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.583
- Well...

10:44.666 --> 10:45.916
No.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.708
- What was that pause?
- Was that?

10:47.791 --> 10:49.708
- What pause?
- There was a pausa!
- No, there was a pausa.

10:49.791 --> 10:51.708
- No.
- Pausa. Yes, there was.

10:51.791 --> 10:53.708
It is not really
my secret to say,

10:53.791 --> 10:55.708
- okay? No.
- No, please.
Please, Tía,

10:55.791 --> 10:57.875
please tell us.
You know how secretive Mom is.

10:57.958 --> 11:00.750
She'll never tell us. We just
want to get to know her better.

11:00.833 --> 11:02.250
And what is Camila
going to say when

11:02.333 --> 11:04.208
- she hears that
I tell you this?
- We're not gonna

11:04.291 --> 11:05.333
tell her shit.

11:05.416 --> 11:08.625
- Tía. Tía!

11:08.708 --> 11:12.083
- Tía...
- Okay, okay! Well...

11:12.166 --> 11:14.833
earlier, when you were
asking about a boyfriend?

11:14.916 --> 11:18.291
When we were young girls,
your mother had a boyfriend.

11:18.375 --> 11:20.666
Uh, he was studying
in the church,

11:20.750 --> 11:24.041
um, en el seminario,
to be a priest,

11:24.125 --> 11:27.583
and they had such a great love
for each other.

11:30.166 --> 11:33.541
This is opening up so easily.

11:33.625 --> 11:35.708
Look. Tía Monse.

11:38.500 --> 11:42.125
I saw them
when I was a little girl.

11:42.208 --> 11:45.791
At that age, I had seen kissing
in the movies and television,

11:45.875 --> 11:47.791
but this was not fake like that.

11:47.875 --> 11:51.583
The love they have
for each other is

11:51.666 --> 11:53.166
maybe what I have been
looking for ever since

11:53.250 --> 11:54.916
and I never did find.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.750
It was a time
when Camila was someone else.

11:57.833 --> 12:00.500
Someone light in the heart.

12:00.583 --> 12:02.625
I want you to meet my boyfriend.

12:03.041 --> 12:06.791
But you have to keep it
a secret, okay?

12:09.375 --> 12:11.000
They brought me
into their world,

12:11.083 --> 12:13.666
- and we did become
like a second family...

12:13.750 --> 12:15.333
...inside our own family.

12:16.625 --> 12:18.708
But we did have to be careful.

12:26.791 --> 12:28.416
Your mother would ask for me

12:28.500 --> 12:30.333
to send secret messages
between them.

12:34.791 --> 12:36.750
They used fake names

12:36.833 --> 12:38.375
and secret areas to meet.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.583
It felt for me
like being a little spy.

12:43.041 --> 12:44.666
But Camila got in trouble,

12:44.750 --> 12:47.375
and they sent him away
to another church.

12:47.458 --> 12:50.166
It broke her heart.

12:50.250 --> 12:51.291
I'm sorry.

12:51.375 --> 12:53.166
And after that,
your mother

12:53.250 --> 12:55.500
- did become
like a different person.

12:55.583 --> 12:57.750
She went away from home,

12:57.833 --> 13:01.250
and your mother and I never did
have that same relationship.

13:02.083 --> 13:03.625
I have to go away now.

13:05.750 --> 13:09.333
I don't know
if she blames me for the note.

13:10.333 --> 13:14.166
But there is more
to this history.

13:14.250 --> 13:16.875
When I have 12 years old,

13:16.958 --> 13:19.541
my mother said to me that Camila
went to the university,

13:19.625 --> 13:22.458
but later, I hear her tell
my father something different.

13:22.541 --> 13:24.583
She said that when the boy

13:24.666 --> 13:27.541
became a priest, that Camila
went to live with him.

13:27.625 --> 13:29.791
- In a sin.
- Oh, my God.

13:29.875 --> 13:32.416
So she stayed with him
even when he was transferred?

13:32.500 --> 13:33.958
At least, that is what I like
to tell myself

13:34.041 --> 13:36.708
because it is less sad
to believe it this way.

13:36.791 --> 13:40.125
Do you remember his name?
Was it Alejandro?

13:40.208 --> 13:41.958
And could he have painted
a portrait of her?

13:42.041 --> 13:44.458
No, that was not his name.

13:44.541 --> 13:45.958
But, like I say,

13:46.041 --> 13:47.583
they'd use codes
and secret names,

13:47.666 --> 13:49.958
so maybe it is something
only she will understand.

13:50.041 --> 13:51.333
Where is he now?

13:51.416 --> 13:53.166
No, no.

13:53.250 --> 13:54.583
This I will not tell you.

13:54.666 --> 13:56.625
- No, please, Tía.
- No.

13:56.708 --> 13:57.916
We just want to help her.
We are trying

13:58.000 --> 14:00.166
to make things better
between us. Please.

14:00.250 --> 14:03.250
That's all. I promise.

14:14.208 --> 14:16.125
That's him.

14:16.208 --> 14:18.500
Come on. I got this.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.250
Oh, hello.

14:21.333 --> 14:24.125
Welcome to La Iglesia
de la Virgen de Guadalupe.

14:24.208 --> 14:26.333
Cool. We're looking
for our mother.

14:26.416 --> 14:28.833
Her name is Camila Diaz.

14:28.916 --> 14:31.000
She left town
a couple of days ago,

14:31.083 --> 14:33.250
and we haven't heard from her.

14:33.333 --> 14:36.291
- I-I am sorry to hear this.
- Does the name

14:36.375 --> 14:39.333
Alejandro mean anything to you?

14:39.416 --> 14:40.958
Alejandro, Alejandro.

14:41.041 --> 14:44.125
Uh, no, I-I do not think so.

14:44.208 --> 14:47.083
Come on. We know
you had an affair with our mom,

14:47.166 --> 14:48.416
and we know
you're back in her life.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.416
We don't know that, actually.

14:50.500 --> 14:52.833
- Little bit, we do.
- We don't know that for sure.
We don't.

14:52.916 --> 14:54.583
This is a tremendous accusation.

14:54.666 --> 14:56.708
Padre,
please forgive my sister.

14:56.791 --> 14:58.458
She's sorry.

14:58.541 --> 15:00.791
We are just very worried
about her,

15:00.875 --> 15:03.625
and we're looking for any
information about where she is.

15:03.708 --> 15:05.875
I am sorry
that you have lost your mother,

15:05.958 --> 15:09.500
but I have not seen Camila

15:09.583 --> 15:11.833
in many, many years.

15:11.916 --> 15:14.041
You and your mother
are in my prayers.

15:14.125 --> 15:16.375
Thank you very much
for your time, Father.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.250
Let's go.

15:18.333 --> 15:20.083
- This guy's a liar.
- Stop it.

15:20.166 --> 15:21.791
- Let's go.
- He's lying. See if you
can find out the truth.

15:21.875 --> 15:23.791
- Shh. Let's go.
- Do you want to find Mom
or not?

15:23.875 --> 15:25.708
- You're the only one
who can do it.

15:25.791 --> 15:28.083
If I do it,
we'll just end up in The Fog.

15:28.166 --> 15:31.333
- He doesn't
want us to know.
- Just try.

15:46.958 --> 15:49.250
Oh, wow.

15:49.333 --> 15:51.500
- We shouldn't...
- Do you know what my dream is?

15:51.583 --> 15:53.166
That I will make love
to you again.

15:53.250 --> 15:55.000
Camila, please. I'm tired.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.375
No!

15:59.000 --> 16:00.500
It's getting married,

16:00.583 --> 16:02.666
and having a family.

16:02.750 --> 16:03.833
With you.

16:07.750 --> 16:10.875
Yes, I think I could
enjoy that life.

16:16.375 --> 16:20.166
My family is already ashamed
that I was transferred.

16:20.250 --> 16:21.666
If I'm excommunicated...

16:21.750 --> 16:23.291
They'll never forgive me.

16:25.625 --> 16:26.833
Camila.

16:29.166 --> 16:31.708
We can't destroy our lives.

16:31.791 --> 16:34.083
I don't want to destroy
your family, either.

16:34.958 --> 16:38.875
We have commitments more
important than us.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.791
I'm sorry, but...

16:44.166 --> 16:45.375
I can't.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.416
- So they did break up.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.708
This doesn't feel right.
I don't like this.

16:51.791 --> 16:53.250
- It feels wrong to be...
- It's fine.

16:53.333 --> 16:54.500
Let's just go.

16:57.875 --> 16:59.791
I know it's hard,

16:59.875 --> 17:01.333
but that pain wasn't yours.

17:01.416 --> 17:03.791
But if people don't want us
digging through their souls...

17:03.875 --> 17:05.500
We're trying to help Mom.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.375
Why is Dad so scared
of me doing this?

17:09.041 --> 17:11.500
I guess he just doesn't think
you could handle...

17:11.583 --> 17:14.750
- certain aspects of it.
- Maybe he's right.

17:14.833 --> 17:17.416
Forget about Dad.
I know you can do this.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.083
And we're doing it
for a good reason.

17:19.166 --> 17:20.916
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.041
Now, Abuelita.
She clearly knows something

17:23.125 --> 17:25.750
she doesn't want to tell us
or even admit to herself.

17:25.833 --> 17:28.250
I don't want to bother Abuelita.

17:28.333 --> 17:30.208
But if you open yourself up
into her memories

17:30.291 --> 17:31.541
like you did in there,

17:31.625 --> 17:33.541
then you can break through
whatever she's hiding.

17:33.625 --> 17:35.083
Okay, fine.

17:35.166 --> 17:36.625
Let's just go and do this

17:36.708 --> 17:39.166
and hope that she's the answer
to all this

17:39.250 --> 17:41.041
so we can find Mom
and just go home.

17:41.125 --> 17:42.125
Becca, I...

17:42.208 --> 17:44.625
No, it's fine. Let's just go.

17:50.916 --> 17:51.708
-Grandma?
-Yes?

17:51.791 --> 17:53.333
Can we talk?

17:53.416 --> 17:54.875
Of course. What is it, dear?

17:55.541 --> 17:58.458
We know about out mother's
relationship with Father Reyes.

17:58.541 --> 18:00.000
What are you talking about?

18:00.666 --> 18:02.250
I don't know about that.

18:02.333 --> 18:05.583
Are you sure you don't know
anything about the painting

18:05.666 --> 18:06.583
or Alejandro?

18:06.666 --> 18:09.916
Please.
Stop bothering me with this.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.958
- I don't know.
- Do it.

18:12.041 --> 18:15.458
- Do the thing.
- Okay.

18:25.125 --> 18:27.125
This is the memory
she was blocking.

18:29.666 --> 18:31.541
There's Mom.

19:09.625 --> 19:11.208
That's the house
from the painting.

19:11.291 --> 19:12.291
Camila!

19:14.250 --> 19:15.458
What are you doing here?

19:16.750 --> 19:19.250
Mom, how did you find me?

19:19.333 --> 19:20.416
Is this where you live?

19:21.333 --> 19:23.041
Who are you living with?

19:23.125 --> 19:25.458
I know you're not
with Father Reyes anymore.

19:25.541 --> 19:27.750
He came by the house
looking for you.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.708
You must be living in sin
with someone new here.

19:30.791 --> 19:32.666
Mom, I swear, it's not--

19:32.750 --> 19:34.458
This is the kind of woman
you are?

19:34.541 --> 19:37.125
One who just sleeps with
whoever comes along.

19:37.208 --> 19:40.291
Mom, why are you saying this?

19:40.375 --> 19:43.333
What will people think
when they find out...

19:43.416 --> 19:45.541
Mom, please, let me explain.

19:45.625 --> 19:47.666
You can do whatever you want,

19:47.750 --> 19:49.750
but don't come back to my house.

19:50.833 --> 19:53.583
You've embarrassed our family.

19:54.250 --> 19:56.250
Mom, please...

19:56.333 --> 19:58.083
Mom!

19:58.166 --> 19:59.500
- Jesus Christ.

19:59.583 --> 20:01.875
Abuelita treated Mom like that?

20:02.875 --> 20:04.458
There's...

20:04.541 --> 20:07.041
There's too much. I can't...

20:07.125 --> 20:08.541
Okay. Get us out of here.

20:13.375 --> 20:15.166
I'm a terrible mother.

20:17.041 --> 20:19.041
I don't know
where Camila went...

20:21.000 --> 20:22.375
but she's an adult.

20:23.166 --> 20:25.875
I can't interfere
in her life again.

20:31.166 --> 20:35.625
I'm going to go lie down.

20:38.666 --> 20:41.500
Well,
that felt horrible.

20:41.583 --> 20:44.541
I'm sorry, Becca.

20:44.625 --> 20:45.750
But we're going to fix
everything wrong

20:45.833 --> 20:47.208
- with our family.

20:47.291 --> 20:48.791
I promise.

20:48.875 --> 20:50.750
I just don't know
how this works.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.416
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- Yeah, you do.

20:53.500 --> 20:54.958
You're doing it.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.458
Come on.

20:57.541 --> 20:59.125
Let's go find Mom.

21:09.750 --> 21:11.833
Okay.

21:24.125 --> 21:25.875
This is it.

21:25.958 --> 21:27.791
This is the house
from the painting.

21:30.666 --> 21:33.333
It's Dad. He must be worried.

21:33.416 --> 21:35.041
This will all be fixed, Becca.

21:35.125 --> 21:38.041
You have the power
to fix anything we do.

21:38.125 --> 21:39.666
This is the way.

21:39.750 --> 21:43.166
We don't know, Alma,
who's gonna be behind that door.

21:43.250 --> 21:45.500
And Mom doesn't want us to know.

21:45.583 --> 21:47.666
- This is our last chance

21:47.750 --> 21:50.458
to not do this.

21:50.541 --> 21:52.833
It'll be fine, okay?

21:55.500 --> 21:58.500
Alma, I...

21:58.583 --> 21:59.916
Becca?

22:00.000 --> 22:01.458
- I...
- Becca?

22:01.541 --> 22:04.416
- Becca?
