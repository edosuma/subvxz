[birds singing]

00:12.180 --> 00:15.716
[music]

00:15.749 --> 00:18.419
- [Elsa] There are no
weekends on a ranch.

00:18.452 --> 00:21.955
The routine of Wednesday
is the routine of Saturday.

00:21.989 --> 00:25.093
And the chores of Tuesday
are still chores on Sunday.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.062
Though the banker
and bookkeeper

00:28.096 --> 00:30.030
may be tethered to a calendar,

00:30.064 --> 00:34.034
ranchers are bound
only to the seasons,

00:34.068 --> 00:37.238
and note the milestones
of their lives by saying,

00:37.271 --> 00:39.173
"We were married
in the spring,"

00:39.207 --> 00:43.577
or "She was born in the fall,"

00:43.611 --> 00:48.882
or perhaps, "On the hottest day
in the driest summer

00:48.916 --> 00:54.622
ever to plague Montana,
my husband returned to me."

00:56.390 --> 00:58.859
[music]

01:14.642 --> 01:15.643
- What is it?

01:27.555 --> 01:28.556
- It's Jack.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.260
They're back.
Cara, they're back!

01:32.293 --> 01:34.295
- Yes, I see.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.564
Emma: I'd love to have that
girl's energy just once.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.366
- Not me.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.206
Jake: Looks like you
got a runner, there, Jack.

01:45.239 --> 01:46.940
- Problem is she's a faller.

01:49.243 --> 01:50.644
John: Better go get her, son.

01:50.678 --> 01:53.080
Before she's up standing at
the alter with a busted nose.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.515
- Better get her, Jack.
before I do.

01:54.548 --> 01:55.716
- You'd never catch me.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.951
- Whoa!
- Woo!

01:57.985 --> 02:00.288
- Hey, don't we got a rule about
running horses to the barn?

02:00.321 --> 02:01.922
Jake: The whole world's
got a rule

02:01.955 --> 02:03.624
about running horses
to the barn.

02:03.657 --> 02:07.228
I guess we're the one renegade
outfit that don't pay attention.

02:07.261 --> 02:08.629
- Everyone's gonna pay attention

02:08.662 --> 02:10.631
next time we want to
walk 'em back to the barn.

02:10.664 --> 02:13.066
- We'll have that argument
when it comes, Zane.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.503
- It's just stupid.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.938
- It's stupid if your wife
ain't standing there

02:17.971 --> 02:19.473
wondering why everyone's
in a hurry

02:19.507 --> 02:21.108
to get back to
the ranch but you. Ya!

02:22.910 --> 02:24.178
- Running to your wife
is one thing,

02:24.212 --> 02:26.747
but running to that damn barn...

02:26.780 --> 02:28.849
I run the hell out of this
horse to see my family, too,

02:28.882 --> 02:30.718
they're just not standing

02:30.751 --> 02:32.019
at that Goddamn
barn waiting for me.

02:33.387 --> 02:35.155
- If you try to jump
from that horse

02:35.189 --> 02:37.925
and run you're going
to break something.

02:37.958 --> 02:41.229
- My running dismount
days are over, darlin'.

02:41.262 --> 02:45.132
It's a long way down, and this
old man's gonna climb it slow.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.868
- [groans]
- Racing across the field to me.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.570
- Taking lessons from my nephew.
- [laughs]

02:49.603 --> 02:51.505
That one seemed worth trying.

02:53.341 --> 02:54.708
- It's effective.
- Yeah.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.111
- I was worried about this trip,
you know?

02:58.145 --> 03:00.248
I don't know why.
It really worried me.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.015
- We had some trouble.

03:02.049 --> 03:03.851
I'll see
the sheriff tomorrow

03:03.884 --> 03:05.085
and talk him through it.

03:05.118 --> 03:09.223
- You just got home.
You're going into town already?

03:09.257 --> 03:11.725
- How 'bout we all go to town?

03:13.160 --> 03:14.562
- [chuckles]

03:15.829 --> 03:17.565
- Missed you, sweetheart.
- Me, too. Me, too.

03:17.598 --> 03:18.599
- Yeah.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.602
[music]

03:37.551 --> 03:38.719
- Where's your horse?

03:38.752 --> 03:40.988
- Henry.
Go to Campbells.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.490
Bring Frank here.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.592
Then go to the Archers.

03:44.625 --> 03:45.893
Now, boy, go!

03:53.901 --> 03:54.935
[grunts]

04:04.011 --> 04:05.513
Ah...

04:08.181 --> 04:11.652
- Banner, my God.
What happened?

04:12.886 --> 04:15.289
- The fucking Duttons happened.

a lotta cars here.

05:39.306 --> 05:40.374
[laughter]

05:44.978 --> 05:47.448
- So are you selling
electricity in the valley?

05:47.481 --> 05:48.749
- Yes, ma'am.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.151
We will run the cable as they
pave the road to the park.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.920
- You say they're paving
the road to the park?

05:52.953 --> 05:56.156
- All the way
from Canada to Mexico.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.224
- What is that?

05:58.225 --> 05:59.527
- That's a washing machine.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.833
- What does it wash?
- Clothes.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.668
- [laughs]
Oh! Can you imagine?

06:07.701 --> 06:08.836
- How?

06:08.869 --> 06:11.038
- Well, an electric
motor spins a cylinder

06:11.071 --> 06:12.740
as water is pumped
through the machine.

06:12.773 --> 06:18.446
Soap is added here and the
agitation removes any soiling.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.447
- Hm.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.014
- What does that wash?

06:21.048 --> 06:22.182
- That's a refrigerator.

06:24.852 --> 06:27.254
The top compartment
keeps food frozen

06:27.287 --> 06:29.022
and the bottom compartment

06:29.056 --> 06:31.425
maintains a temperature
of 38 degrees.

06:31.459 --> 06:34.294
- And you sell these?
- We rent them.

06:34.327 --> 06:35.829
- So you sell electricity,

06:35.863 --> 06:38.165
and then you rent all the
things that need electricity.

06:39.366 --> 06:40.501
- More or less.

06:40.534 --> 06:41.869
- But we don't need any
of these things.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.604
- Well, they're conveniences.

06:43.637 --> 06:46.373
Their use gives you time
to do other things.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.641
- What other things?

06:47.675 --> 06:50.744
- Well...
Like other chores.

06:50.778 --> 06:53.714
- Until you invent machines to
do those, then what do we do?

06:53.747 --> 06:55.883
- Go on a picnic.
- [laughter]

06:55.916 --> 06:57.050
- Go for a swim.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.218
You can go to the cinema.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.588
You can enjoy
a more leisurely life.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.189
- But that ain't more leisurely

07:02.222 --> 07:04.758
because we gotta work more
to pay for all this stuff.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.560
- He's got you there.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.261
- This is the future.

07:08.295 --> 07:10.631
Every home in New York City
has electricity.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.099
They have refrigerators,

07:12.132 --> 07:14.668
and some even have
electric stoves.

07:14.702 --> 07:16.937
- No here's the thing,
we buy all this stuff,

07:16.970 --> 07:18.506
we're not working
for ourselves anymore.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.607
We're working for you.

07:24.044 --> 07:27.548
- The washing machine seems like
a good idea, I must admit.

07:27.581 --> 07:28.716
- It is the future, ma'am.

07:29.149 --> 07:29.983
- Hmph.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.053
How are you sir?

07:37.958 --> 07:39.459
McDowell: Jacob, you can't be
hanging people

07:39.493 --> 07:41.294
out in the woods
like that no more.

07:41.328 --> 07:43.163
This ain't no cowboy justice.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.865
- What should
I have done different?

07:44.898 --> 07:46.233
- You should've
brought them here.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.468
- Where they'd just get lynched
and hung anyway.

07:48.502 --> 07:51.438
I just saved a mob
the trouble.

07:51.471 --> 07:55.509
I hung my share of men with you
standing right beside me, Bill.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.511
- We got a big enough problem
with them cattle thieves

07:57.545 --> 08:00.080
out of Wyoming,
we don't need a range war

08:00.113 --> 08:01.048
with the sheep herders.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.116
- They run their sheep
on my ground,

08:03.150 --> 08:06.386
and then they attacked us
when we came upon them.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.288
Range war's already begun.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.323
You get some deputies up there

08:10.357 --> 08:12.926
and you keep them sum-bitches
on their own land,

08:12.960 --> 08:14.762
or I'll do it.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.531
And you've seen how I do it.

08:18.732 --> 08:21.602
[music]

08:40.387 --> 08:41.955
- Oh.
[chuckles]

08:41.989 --> 08:43.190
- Hey.

08:43.223 --> 08:45.859
- By God, Jake. If this is
progress you can have it.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.361
I've walked six blocks and
you're the first person I know.

08:48.395 --> 08:50.263
- You gotta put town
in the category

08:50.297 --> 08:52.132
of "things you do
for your wife."

08:52.165 --> 08:54.234
- Hell, my wife won't even
come to town anymore.

08:54.267 --> 08:57.237
- I'll admit a fondness
for some of the soda shops.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.339
- Well, you are Irish.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.908
[both laugh]

09:00.941 --> 09:02.610
- How's your herd?

09:02.643 --> 09:04.878
- Skinny.
Driest I ever seen it.

09:04.912 --> 09:05.979
How's yours?

09:06.013 --> 09:07.480
- I took 'em high.

09:07.514 --> 09:09.617
- Damn sheepers grazed off
all the high ground,

09:09.650 --> 09:11.484
whether it's their
ground or not.

09:11.518 --> 09:12.986
- I'm working on that.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.689
- Well, if you need any help,
you let me know.

09:15.723 --> 09:18.391
- If I do, it's gonna be
the roughest kind of help.

09:18.425 --> 09:20.728
- Rough is what those
sons of bitches need.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.696
Best to your family.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.264
- And to yours.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.286
[car honks]

09:50.257 --> 09:51.959
- Jacob.

09:51.992 --> 09:54.194
Jacob, I swear to God you'll
get yourself killed

09:54.227 --> 09:56.830
by one of them motor wagons.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.565
Listen, it's too late
to head back.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.333
We're stuck here for the night.

10:00.367 --> 10:01.769
- I got rooms at the hotel.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.003
- Yes, but what about supper?

10:03.036 --> 10:04.672
- Well, they have supper, too.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.406
- There's twenty of us.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.642
- 14 of who can
be on their own.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.414
- Got rooms booked
at the Hotel Bozeman.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.649
We leave first thing.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.725
[music]

10:35.235 --> 10:37.037
- What would you like to do?

10:37.070 --> 10:40.173
- Well, what would
you like to do?

10:40.207 --> 10:42.342
- Listen to the music
and watch the sunset.

10:44.544 --> 10:46.179
Then go back to the hotel and...

10:48.248 --> 10:50.317
let someone wait
on me for once.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.152
- We can do that.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.836
- I don't know, Jack,
this don't look like it.

11:08.869 --> 11:11.571
- He said third door
down the alley.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.473
This is the third door.

11:17.778 --> 11:18.812
[pounding]

11:20.547 --> 11:21.815

11:21.849 --> 11:23.183
- Umbrellas?

11:23.216 --> 11:24.852

11:25.919 --> 11:28.121
- I told you this place
was real, Dennis.

11:28.155 --> 11:31.224
- I ain't seen nothing that
convinces me yet, Jack.

11:31.258 --> 11:32.826
- Don't you worry,
you just wait.

Absolutely wild.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.786
I feel like I'm back
in the city.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.053
- You are in the city.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.922
- Bozeman isn't a city.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.857
- Sure feels like one in here.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.003
- Hey, where'd all these
people come from?

12:16.036 --> 12:17.670
- Back East, I think.

12:17.704 --> 12:20.073
Whoop it up in town,
and vacation in the park.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.042
- How do all these Easterners
know about this place

12:22.075 --> 12:24.111
and I just heard of it?

12:24.144 --> 12:25.345
- What'll you have?

12:25.378 --> 12:26.513
- What do you got?

12:26.546 --> 12:27.714
- We got it all.

12:30.017 --> 12:31.952
- What are the fancy
folks drinking?

12:31.985 --> 12:34.521
- Gin Rickeys for the men
and Bees Knees for the ladies.

12:34.554 --> 12:37.424
- We'll do that.
Four of each.

- I don't even know this song.
- [laughs]

13:37.750 --> 13:38.886

13:40.620 --> 13:42.522
I want to try it, Jack.

13:42.555 --> 13:43.891
- I think she wants to try it.

13:43.924 --> 13:46.559
- I think you better try it.
- Yeah, I think I should.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.252
I've fumbled the moment,
I'm afraid.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.995
- You haven't fumbled anything.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.265
[music]

17:19.939 --> 17:21.608
- I'm dizzy.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.177
- Me too.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.061
[laughing]

18:19.599 --> 18:21.701
[music]

18:44.157 --> 18:46.559
- A crafty bugger.

18:46.593 --> 18:49.028
Unlike a lion that stalks
or a leopard that ambushes,

18:49.061 --> 18:51.298
these hyenas will do both.

18:51.331 --> 18:52.965
Stalks a man down
at the latrine,

18:52.999 --> 18:54.767
followed another
into his tent.

18:54.801 --> 18:58.070
One man was killed five miles
from here while surveying

18:58.104 --> 19:00.072
ten feet from his car
in the middle of the day.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.843
No pattern to it.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.945
- You try baiting it?

19:05.978 --> 19:07.480
- I've had a goat tied
to a tree so long

19:07.514 --> 19:09.782
we bring it food and water now.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.083
It's been tied there a week.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.086
It's not as though there's
a food shortage here.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.024
- She's either
old or she's hurt.

19:20.427 --> 19:22.229
And it's just one,
it's not a pack.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.831
- A pack would eat a man
to the bone.

19:24.864 --> 19:28.301
These are just killed,
barely eaten at all.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.238
Like it's fun for her.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.608
[music]

19:50.523 --> 19:53.793
We build the fires up at night

19:53.826 --> 19:56.062
and I have men patrolling
in groups of three.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.369
[chickens clucking]

20:02.402 --> 20:05.238
My biggest worry is that hyena
drags a man down

20:05.272 --> 20:08.275
and lions stumble upon it.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.577
Then a whole pride
has a taste for us.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.115
- When do my guides get here?

20:16.148 --> 20:18.651
- Should have been
here yesterday.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.119
- How far is their village?

20:20.152 --> 20:21.254
- Ten miles, maybe.

20:21.288 --> 20:22.088
- They had any attacks up there?

20:22.121 --> 20:23.256
- Don't know.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.825
I wish I knew more, but if
I did I'd be the hunter.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.562
[clears throat]

20:40.006 --> 20:42.241
[music]

20:57.757 --> 20:59.091
[giggles]

21:24.050 --> 21:25.318
Spencer: Don't wander far.

21:28.087 --> 21:29.255
- It doesn't look real.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.424
Like I walked into a painting.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.699
- It's an odd place.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.668
Nothing as beautiful
as when the sun rises

21:41.701 --> 21:43.736
or right before it sets,

21:43.770 --> 21:45.638
but in the middle of the day
when the sun beats this place

21:45.672 --> 21:46.773
like a hammer.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.411
- Do you believe Darwin
saying we come from monkeys,

21:51.444 --> 21:53.380
and all mankind
began right here?

21:54.814 --> 21:56.649
- I can show you a place
with the footprints of a child

21:56.683 --> 21:58.351
baked into the lava rock.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.523
I don't know where we came from,

22:07.360 --> 22:10.663
but we've been here
since stone was soft.

22:10.697 --> 22:11.931
- Long time.

22:14.501 --> 22:17.003
- In America, if you walk up
on an animal,

22:17.036 --> 22:18.471
they run away from you.

22:18.505 --> 22:19.606
Don't matter what it is...

22:21.741 --> 22:23.910
a wolf, a deer, bear...

22:23.943 --> 22:26.312
but here, they look at
you like you're a nuisance.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.650
Something that's been harassing
'em for a million years.

22:34.821 --> 22:36.489
Hm. We probably have.

22:37.557 --> 22:38.925
- Are the footprints far?

22:45.432 --> 22:46.666
- Not too far.

22:49.068 --> 22:50.069
- Show me.

22:54.006 --> 22:55.508
[music]

23:08.287 --> 23:11.924
[music]

23:56.368 --> 23:57.470
- What are those?

24:00.907 --> 24:02.008
- Impala.

24:10.850 --> 24:11.951
- They look like goats.

24:13.219 --> 24:14.521
- They probably are.

24:15.722 --> 24:16.756
[chuckles]

24:44.651 --> 24:46.519
- I want to ask you something.

24:46.553 --> 24:47.520
- Ask away.

24:47.554 --> 24:49.021
- Been giving
it a lot of thought...

24:49.055 --> 24:50.623
- This sounds ominous.

24:50.657 --> 24:54.727
- Alexandra's just too long.
Just in general.

24:54.761 --> 24:55.828
- You don't like my name.

24:55.862 --> 24:56.829
- It's beautiful, it's just,

24:56.863 --> 24:58.130
if I need to yell at you
or something...

24:58.164 --> 24:59.231
- Why would you need
to yell at me?

24:59.265 --> 25:00.767
- Not at you,
but in your direction.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.002
Like if there's a, you know,
there's a lion or something,

25:03.035 --> 25:05.738
If I say, "Alexandra, look out
there's a lion," it's...

25:05.772 --> 25:07.740
- If there's a lion don't even
use my name, just say "lion."

25:07.774 --> 25:09.441
- It's just a mouthful is the
deal, and I was just hoping

25:09.475 --> 25:10.476
I could call you Alex.

25:13.445 --> 25:14.914
- Then call me Alex.

25:16.082 --> 25:18.017
- Good deal.

25:18.050 --> 25:19.518
- I'm glad we worked that out.
- Mm-hm.

25:22.555 --> 25:23.956
Well, if it was that
hard to ask about a nickname,

25:23.990 --> 25:25.758
I won't hold my breath
for a proposal.

25:28.227 --> 25:29.762
- Proposal?

25:29.796 --> 25:32.231
- I must say, you appeared
much smarter at the bar.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.602
A marriage proposal.
[chuckles]

25:36.869 --> 25:37.870
I won't hold my breath.

25:39.405 --> 25:41.140
- Hell, I'll ask you
that right now.

25:41.173 --> 25:42.609
- [laughs]
- I mean it.

25:45.444 --> 25:48.781
- I think this affair might
need to mature beyond a day.

25:48.815 --> 25:49.849
- Why?

25:51.684 --> 25:53.419
What for?

25:53.452 --> 25:55.521
Are you worried there's things
about me you might not like?

25:58.858 --> 26:00.426
I can promise you,
there's plenty.

26:03.730 --> 26:05.998
- I don't hear a question.

26:06.032 --> 26:07.399
- Marry me.

26:07.433 --> 26:08.768
- That's a statement.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.102
- It's a demand.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.806
- You Americans are brutes.

26:15.207 --> 26:16.976
- Yes, ma'am.

26:25.417 --> 26:26.686
- I will.

26:26.719 --> 26:28.187
I'll marry you.

26:31.924 --> 26:32.925
[fly buzzes]

26:35.995 --> 26:38.530
Now, I would like to see
these footprints

26:38.564 --> 26:41.133
from the dawn of man, hm?

26:41.167 --> 26:42.935
Unless you need
to cross "naming our children"

26:42.969 --> 26:44.036
off the list as well.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.539
- We should give it
some thought.

26:47.573 --> 26:49.141
- [laughs]

26:51.678 --> 26:52.979
Thank you.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.481
Let's go.
[giggling]

27:01.487 --> 27:03.389
[music]

27:12.965 --> 27:17.569
You're right, it's a child.
All alone out here.

27:17.603 --> 27:19.405
There's no toes.

27:19.438 --> 27:20.973
- Maybe we didn't
have toes back then.

27:22.141 --> 27:23.242
Maybe he was wearing sandals.

27:40.226 --> 27:42.028
- I've never felt small before.

27:42.061 --> 27:45.364
[breathing heavy]

27:46.833 --> 27:48.100
I've never felt like my life...

27:55.708 --> 27:58.077
Our time here is an eye blink.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.547
It's one exhaled breath
and then we're gone.

28:01.580 --> 28:03.382
- That's why I'm not wasting
any time with you.

28:12.591 --> 28:14.693
[music]

28:35.447 --> 28:36.816
[elephant trumpeting
in distance]

28:41.553 --> 28:42.588
[elephants growling]

28:50.763 --> 28:51.864
- They don't look real to me.

28:54.266 --> 28:59.872
They look like God just looked
at shapes in the clouds and...

28:59.906 --> 29:01.407
made animals out of 'em.

29:02.775 --> 29:04.343
That's how much sense
they make to me.

29:11.583 --> 29:15.354
- When I first saw you,
all I saw was this sullen man.

29:18.891 --> 29:20.592
I see the boy in you now.

29:23.195 --> 29:24.496
I see our boy in you.

29:26.365 --> 29:28.300
- I see him in you.

29:30.136 --> 29:32.704
- My parents are going
to fucking hate you.

29:32.738 --> 29:34.706
- Mine are gonna love you.

29:34.740 --> 29:36.375
- You have parents?

29:36.408 --> 29:39.946
I fancied you just crawled
from the wilds of America.

29:42.949 --> 29:45.051
I rather like my version better.

29:45.084 --> 29:46.752
[heavy footsteps]

29:48.454 --> 29:49.755

31:06.098 --> 31:10.502
[music]

31:10.536 --> 31:12.838
- Alex, give me your hand.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.440
Alex?

31:14.473 --> 31:16.475
Give me your hand.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.710
It's okay, give me
your hand, come on.

31:22.915 --> 31:24.250
Here you go, come on.

31:24.283 --> 31:26.052
There you go, there you go,
right there. Right there.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.558
There you go, come on.

31:35.194 --> 31:37.429
- Understand why you
shortened it to Alex, now.

31:37.463 --> 31:40.032
Much more efficient.

31:40.066 --> 31:43.035
- Good. Help me, help me.

31:43.069 --> 31:44.036
[grunts]

31:44.070 --> 31:45.471
Alex?

31:46.572 --> 31:48.907
Help me. Ready?

31:48.941 --> 31:50.576
Push.

31:50.609 --> 31:53.045
-Push.
-[grunts]

31:53.079 --> 31:54.846
Okay, hang on.
Hang on.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.782
[grunting]

32:31.150 --> 32:32.451
- What now?

32:37.689 --> 32:40.492
- We can't walk out here.
Not at night.

32:42.828 --> 32:47.733
Besides, we just rang
a fourteen-ton dinner bell.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.072
We need to get up that tree.

32:54.206 --> 32:55.774
- Wouldn't it be safer
to stay in the truck?

32:55.807 --> 32:58.310
- Darling, there is nothing safe
about this truck. Come on.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.548
[music]

33:13.892 --> 33:15.127
Spencer: There you go.

33:17.163 --> 33:18.797
There you go.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.366
- [grunting]

33:27.173 --> 33:28.207
Spencer: Jesus.

33:33.879 --> 33:35.347
[groans]

33:36.248 --> 33:37.616
For moments like these.

33:41.253 --> 33:42.788
- I must admit,

33:42.821 --> 33:45.191
I had a different vision
of how our day would end.

33:45.224 --> 33:47.426
- [chuckling]

33:47.459 --> 33:48.860
- It's not funny.

33:48.894 --> 33:50.296
- Darlin', there aren't
words to describe the pickle

33:50.329 --> 33:52.198
we just found ourselves in.

33:52.231 --> 33:53.232
- Is it bad?

33:54.333 --> 33:55.667
- We need a higher tree.

34:02.074 --> 34:03.442
- This is the highest
tree around.

34:03.475 --> 34:04.576
- That's the pickle.

34:07.279 --> 34:08.714
- What do we do?

34:08.747 --> 34:10.048
- We'll wait here till morning.

34:10.082 --> 34:11.983
And we pray that a pride
of lions or a leopard

34:12.017 --> 34:13.952
don't want up
this tree, either.

34:13.985 --> 34:17.889
- You think they'd want up
the tree while we're in it?

34:20.159 --> 34:21.827
- We're the reason
that they'd want up the tree.

34:24.130 --> 34:25.264
- Hmm.

34:26.332 --> 34:28.367
Plan to share that?
Thank you.

34:32.571 --> 34:33.572
Mm.

34:40.146 --> 34:44.483
[music]

34:49.288 --> 34:51.290
- It's even more
beautiful from here.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.595
This could be our last night.

34:58.264 --> 35:00.432
- I won't let it.
- But it could.

35:03.001 --> 35:04.303
- I won't let it.

35:58.624 --> 35:59.658
- Hyenas.

36:45.704 --> 36:46.705
- No sound.

36:55.514 --> 36:56.582
- Are they gone?

36:56.615 --> 36:58.717
- It's gonna be this all night.

37:54.172 --> 37:55.341
We're here!

We're here!

38:17.863 --> 38:18.797

38:18.830 --> 38:19.865
- Up the tree!

38:24.570 --> 38:25.771
- Good God, man.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.839
- Tell me about it.

38:27.873 --> 38:30.409
Give me your hand.

38:30.442 --> 38:32.444
I'm going to send
Alex down to you.

38:32.478 --> 38:33.979
- Alex?
- My fiancé.

38:34.012 --> 38:35.714
At least she was
a few hours ago.

38:37.983 --> 38:39.851
You still my fiancé?

38:39.885 --> 38:41.620
- We'll talk about
it in the car.

38:42.220 --> 38:43.221
- Take this.

38:56.301 --> 38:59.004
- Thank you.

38:59.037 --> 39:00.606
- You're not out
of the bush yet.

39:08.814 --> 39:11.149
Any chance you'd care
to climb down now?

39:11.182 --> 39:13.018
There's a pride of lions
not fifty feet from me.

39:14.953 --> 39:17.389
- Coming.

39:17.423 --> 39:19.357
Spencer: Here.

39:32.270 --> 39:34.239
- My God, man.
I'll buy you another rope.

39:34.272 --> 39:36.808
- No.
This one's lucky.

39:52.591 --> 39:55.326
- I looked death in the eye and
I didn't feel alive, Spencer.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.797
I only felt horror.

39:58.830 --> 40:00.331
- But you felt.

40:02.333 --> 40:03.869
I never said
it was gonna be fun.

40:05.437 --> 40:07.338
I just said you'd feel.

40:07.372 --> 40:09.074
- I don't want to feel
like that.

40:12.277 --> 40:15.013
Do you understand me?

40:15.046 --> 40:17.348
I don't ever want
to feel like that again.

40:17.382 --> 40:20.619
- For a long time that was
the only way I could feel.

40:20.652 --> 40:23.088
Till I met you.

40:23.121 --> 40:26.191
And I don't ever want to feel
that way again, either.

40:26.224 --> 40:28.126
- It's settled then.

40:28.159 --> 40:29.661
Tomorrow you'll find a new job.

40:32.363 --> 40:35.366
- Honey, that wasn't my job.

40:35.400 --> 40:37.769
That was just you and me
taking a drive in the country.

40:37.803 --> 40:41.039
- Perhaps I should alter
my perspective.

40:41.072 --> 40:42.941
The price of making love
under the sun twice in a day

40:42.974 --> 40:46.111
is being attacked by
a pride of lions.

40:46.144 --> 40:48.413
- Three times.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.348
Day's not over yet.

40:51.550 --> 40:53.451
- [clears throat]
I feel I should point out that

40:53.485 --> 40:56.755
I can hear every word
you both say.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.990
- Then you understand why
I'm asking you to drive faster.

41:04.663 --> 41:07.432
- Or just have sex
in the back of my auto.

41:09.768 --> 41:10.769
Why not.

41:16.508 --> 41:17.843
[water running]

41:31.923 --> 41:35.561
- Morning.
- Morning.

41:35.594 --> 41:37.162
- You want in here?

41:37.195 --> 41:39.931
- No.

41:39.965 --> 41:41.533
Just watching.

41:41.567 --> 41:44.603
- Not sure this
is worth watching.

41:44.636 --> 41:46.538
- Oh, it's worth watching.

41:46.572 --> 41:49.140
After all these years,
it's still worth watching...

41:50.208 --> 41:51.943
You could watch
me too, I suppose.

41:51.977 --> 41:54.045
You know it's all the rage now.

41:54.079 --> 41:58.550
Women shaving--their legs,
beneath their arms.

42:00.518 --> 42:03.454
- Interesting fad, to be sure.

42:03.488 --> 42:06.858
- I wonder what that says
about us, as a species.

42:06.892 --> 42:09.427
I mean it's not as if women
were running a straight razor

42:09.460 --> 42:12.698
down their legs a decade ago.

42:12.731 --> 42:14.866
They invented a razor
specifically for women

42:14.900 --> 42:18.236
when no need for one existed,
then invented the need.

42:18.269 --> 42:21.106
As if selling razors to half
the population wasn't enough.

42:22.808 --> 42:24.475
What?

42:24.509 --> 42:26.377
- I didn't say a word.

42:26.411 --> 42:28.079
- But don't you find it curious?

42:28.113 --> 42:30.716
- I'm not curious.
It's greed. That's it.

42:30.749 --> 42:32.450
- Exactly.
That's exactly my point.

42:32.483 --> 42:35.486
What does that say about us,
as a species?

42:35.520 --> 42:38.256
- We've been married
for 40 years--

42:38.289 --> 42:39.557
- Forty-four.

42:39.591 --> 42:43.795
- Okay, I'm rounding down
to make us feel younger.

42:43.829 --> 42:45.130
- [laughs]
Well, that's not working.

42:45.163 --> 42:46.665
- And in all those years,

42:46.698 --> 42:48.266
you've have never asked
me a question

42:48.299 --> 42:50.636
that you did not
have the answer to.

42:50.669 --> 42:52.938
- Ah. I have an answer.

42:52.971 --> 42:54.305
- I know.

42:54.339 --> 42:55.774
- Care to hear it?

42:55.807 --> 42:57.643
- I can't wait to hear it.

42:57.676 --> 43:00.946
- It will be the thing
that ends us.

43:00.979 --> 43:03.682
Greed will be the thing
that kills us all.

43:03.715 --> 43:05.784
- I'm sure you're right.

43:08.086 --> 43:10.722
Now what do you really want
to talk about?

43:10.756 --> 43:13.725
- Oh...nothing, really.

43:13.759 --> 43:15.193
I just wanted to talk

43:15.226 --> 43:18.329
and I wanted you to
listen and you did.

43:18.363 --> 43:20.165
I wonder if you know
how rare that is.

43:21.700 --> 43:23.669
- I know how rare you are.

43:25.370 --> 43:29.841
Which is it is
a pleasure and a joy

43:29.875 --> 43:34.312
to listen to you babble
on about utter nonsense.

43:34.345 --> 43:36.782
- [laughs]
It's not nonsense.

43:36.815 --> 43:39.785
One day women will be shaving
between their legs

43:39.818 --> 43:42.520
because some razor company
told them to, you watch.

43:42.553 --> 43:44.489
- I won't be there to watch.
Breakfast?

43:44.522 --> 43:46.792
- Breakfast be lovely.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.228
[exhales]

43:55.466 --> 43:56.601
- Jacob?

43:58.403 --> 44:02.173
Jacob...
What are you doing?

44:02.207 --> 44:04.609
- I was just wondering who
this old man is

44:04.642 --> 44:06.177
staring at me in the mirror?

44:07.545 --> 44:09.414
When the hell did that happen?

44:16.021 --> 44:17.789
- Never seen that man before.

44:35.673 --> 44:38.409
- We run out of pavement,
you walk these horses.

44:38.443 --> 44:41.212
I don't want you rattling
these ladies to death.

44:41.246 --> 44:42.247
- Yes, sir.

44:43.348 --> 44:45.150
- We'll ride with the wagon

44:45.183 --> 44:46.451
Y'all get back to the ranch.

44:46.484 --> 44:47.919
- Let me leave a
few cowboys with you.

44:47.953 --> 44:49.420
- You're riding in front.

44:49.454 --> 44:51.522
If there's any trouble,
you'll run into it first.

44:51.556 --> 44:52.557
- Yes, sir.

44:54.059 --> 44:56.427
Let's go.

44:56.461 --> 44:57.829
- Here ya go.

44:57.863 --> 45:00.331
[music]

45:43.241 --> 45:46.111
- Finally, some clouds.
And maybe some rain.

45:46.144 --> 45:47.545
- We need rain.

45:47.578 --> 45:50.115
We just don't need it while
we're sitting in this buggy.

45:50.148 --> 45:54.519
- We need rain and we ain't
choosy about when God brings it.

45:54.552 --> 45:56.054
John: Better bring it soon.

45:56.087 --> 45:57.956
- [gunshot]

45:57.989 --> 46:00.525
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

46:00.558 --> 46:02.360
- Shooting from this direction.

46:02.393 --> 46:03.428
- Yep.

46:05.463 --> 46:07.098
- [gunshot]
- [woman screaming]

46:10.368 --> 46:11.702
- Get out of the wagon!

46:11.736 --> 46:13.171
Get out of the wagon, now!

46:13.204 --> 46:14.372
Now!

46:14.405 --> 46:15.506
-Get out of the wagon!

47:55.040 --> 47:56.174
- Here they come.

47:56.207 --> 47:57.475
Jacob: Mind your ammo.

48:05.183 --> 48:06.717
- Stay down. Stay down.

48:13.458 --> 48:14.459
Damn it!

50:12.243 --> 50:13.844
- We both are.

50:13.878 --> 50:15.846
- Go after that buggy.
We're gonna need it.

You don't want to see this.

50:58.523 --> 50:59.857

Just wait!

Hell is where you'll go
if you do this, ma'am.

51:59.650 --> 52:01.252
All right, take me to the
nearest sheriff

52:01.286 --> 52:03.221
and let him hang me...

52:03.254 --> 52:05.456
That way you'll get your justice
without closing

52:05.490 --> 52:07.658
the gates of Heaven.

52:07.692 --> 52:09.194

Put Elizabeth on that

There scissors, top drawer.
Two pair.

53:04.982 --> 53:06.417
Bring them, both of them.

Carl, Carl, through that door on
the left, there's fresh linens.

53:09.854 --> 53:11.256

bring it here.

Thank you.

Ah!

Press these
against the wounds,

53:32.343 --> 53:33.478
it'll stop the bleeding.

53:33.511 --> 53:34.845
Press hard.

53:34.879 --> 53:36.747
- Jake, you're going to be fine.

53:36.781 --> 53:38.316
- You get 'em all?

53:38.349 --> 53:39.617
- One drove off.

53:39.650 --> 53:41.218
I'll send for the
sheriff first thing.

53:41.252 --> 53:42.787
- No sheriff.

53:42.820 --> 53:45.390
They find out what
they've done to me...

53:45.423 --> 53:47.392
they'll come for this place.

53:47.425 --> 53:51.862
The banks, miners.

53:51.896 --> 53:53.664
The thieves.

No sheriff.

53:55.800 --> 53:58.603
Ah...Cara.

53:59.404 --> 54:01.606
It's no use.

You're still breathing.

You and I begin with him.

wait your turn.

Cara, we have no time.
