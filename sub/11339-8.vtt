00:01.744 --> 00:04.264
Garcia, voice-over:
I believe humanity
was born from conflict.

00:05.485 --> 00:07.948
Maybe that's why in all
of us lives a dark side.

00:09.255 --> 00:10.511
Some of us choose to embrace it.

00:11.090 --> 00:13.124
Some have no choice.

00:13.192 --> 00:15.126
The rest of us fight it.

00:15.194 --> 00:17.195
And in the end,

00:17.263 --> 00:20.465
it's as natural
as the air we breathe.

00:20.533 --> 00:22.867
At some point,

00:22.935 --> 00:25.804
all of us are forced
to face the truth.

00:27.606 --> 00:29.607
Ourselves.

00:29.675 --> 00:31.843
For me that day has come.

00:40.853 --> 00:42.887
My God!

00:42.955 --> 00:45.390
You look so beautiful.

00:45.458 --> 00:47.058
No, no, no, don't cry.

00:47.126 --> 00:49.561
Your mascara will bleed.

00:49.628 --> 00:53.231
Look at you.
So perfect.

00:55.634 --> 00:57.635
My hands...

00:57.703 --> 01:00.839
I--I can't feel my hands.

01:00.906 --> 01:04.042
Please, cut me loose.

01:07.680 --> 01:09.381
She has that
something special

01:09.432 --> 01:12.484
so few have these days,
don't you think?

01:12.551 --> 01:14.686
What do you want from me?

01:14.754 --> 01:16.388
What you desire most.

01:16.455 --> 01:18.757
I saw it the moment
I set eyes on you.

01:18.824 --> 01:20.058
Saw what?

01:20.126 --> 01:21.226
Fame.

01:25.948 --> 01:27.615
You will never look
more beautiful

01:27.700 --> 01:30.368
than this moment
right now.

01:34.440 --> 01:37.876
I was 18 when I faced a man who
chose to embrace his dark side,

01:37.943 --> 01:41.813
and by doing so,
he took my humanity.

01:41.881 --> 01:44.215
Every day since
I have put on a mask

01:44.283 --> 01:47.802
to hide what
now suffocates me.

01:47.887 --> 01:49.721
The truth.

01:50.790 --> 01:54.726
And nothing speaks louder
than the truth.

01:54.793 --> 01:57.228
Out of the shadows,

01:57.296 --> 01:59.864
a taxi pulls into the alleyway.

02:03.402 --> 02:05.653
She moves into the light,

02:05.738 --> 02:08.473
radiant, captivating.

02:08.524 --> 02:10.808
Out of the shadows,
Robert sees her.

02:10.860 --> 02:15.196
Never has she looked more beautiful
than this moment right now.

02:16.415 --> 02:19.484
There's a sadness
to her.

02:20.753 --> 02:23.088
For a moment,
I didn't think you'd come.

02:23.155 --> 02:25.023
I had to.

02:25.091 --> 02:27.225
What is it?

02:28.928 --> 02:30.562
What if...

02:31.764 --> 02:34.365
What if all we have

02:34.433 --> 02:36.351
is all we were meant
to be?

02:36.435 --> 02:37.769
No! No. No.

02:37.836 --> 02:40.355
It's had. Past tense. Had.

02:40.439 --> 02:41.689
Not have. Try it again.

02:41.774 --> 02:43.575
I can't. Not like this.

02:43.642 --> 02:46.344
Don't cry. Don't cry.

02:46.395 --> 02:48.279
Otherwise you'll
relieve the audience.

02:48.347 --> 02:51.316
Fight back the tears
and they'll cry for you.

02:51.383 --> 02:53.368
Untie my hands.
Let me move.

02:53.452 --> 02:55.420
I'll get it.
I swear.

02:58.891 --> 03:01.926
Hold the moment
and you hold the audience.

03:03.162 --> 03:04.829
What if all we had

03:04.880 --> 03:07.165
was all were were
meant to be?

03:07.216 --> 03:10.168
My love, oh, my love,

03:10.236 --> 03:13.171
to my grave I will
carry you in my heart.

03:13.222 --> 03:14.172
Oh, wait, please!

03:14.223 --> 03:16.174
Please, let me try it
one more time!

03:16.225 --> 03:17.308
Uhh!

03:17.376 --> 03:20.878
This is all you were
ever meant to be.

03:20.930 --> 03:22.981
No, I can do it.
I promise.

03:23.048 --> 03:24.082
You'll never grow old.

03:25.351 --> 03:27.685
No, well, wait, wait.
Just give me one more chance.

03:27.736 --> 03:28.686
You should leave now.

03:28.754 --> 03:30.772
I can do it!
Oh, God.

03:30.856 --> 03:32.574
Please, no, let me do it
one more time, please.

03:32.658 --> 03:35.160
Oh, God, I don't want
to die! No, no--

03:48.474 --> 03:51.125
Oh! Oh, my God!

03:51.210 --> 03:53.912
Oh, my God! Aah! Aah!

03:53.979 --> 03:56.080
Aah! Aah! Oh, my God!

04:10.896 --> 04:13.147
Melissa Crane?

04:13.232 --> 04:14.482
Get out.

04:14.567 --> 04:16.100
Alison Gardner?

04:16.168 --> 04:18.236
Get out before
I call the police.

04:18.303 --> 04:21.172
I called them.
And they'll be here,

04:21.240 --> 04:23.074
but not before I'm done.

04:23.142 --> 04:24.175
Done?

04:24.243 --> 04:26.077
Done with what?

04:39.258 --> 04:43.194
Nine girls you raped
and you butchered.

04:43.262 --> 04:46.164
You took from them
what you took from me.

04:46.232 --> 04:49.400
But I survived.

04:50.769 --> 04:53.805
You should have
killed me, Clarence.

05:40.819 --> 05:42.737
Detective Croft?

05:44.039 --> 05:46.357
I've seen a lot
over the years,

05:46.408 --> 05:47.859
but nothing like this.

05:47.926 --> 05:49.860
Like what?

05:49.912 --> 05:51.663
I didn't notice it at first,

05:51.714 --> 05:55.099
but then when I saw it,
I knew I had to call you.

05:59.838 --> 06:01.639
Look at her face, Prentiss.

06:01.707 --> 06:03.007
Yep.

06:03.075 --> 06:04.909
I guess you guys
have seen it all.

06:06.045 --> 06:07.145
Thought I had.

06:07.212 --> 06:08.680
What do you make of it?

06:08.747 --> 06:11.215
Nothing good.

06:11.266 --> 06:14.752
All right, listen, I need wide-angle
shots of her body, torso,

06:14.820 --> 06:17.055
close-ups of her face
and her mouth.

06:18.390 --> 06:21.693
Whoever did this has a mind
I don't want to understand.

06:21.744 --> 06:24.429
That's a luxury
we can't afford.

06:27.066 --> 06:29.000
Kelly Landis went missing
3 days ago.

06:29.067 --> 06:32.503
2 days ago, the Georgetown
"Monitor" received this.

06:32.571 --> 06:34.339
So whoever took this,
took Kelly.

06:34.406 --> 06:37.342
And wanted the world
to know it.

06:37.409 --> 06:39.010
Is that you?

06:39.078 --> 06:40.511
Where was she found?

06:40.579 --> 06:44.148
Uh, she was found
in Georgetown, in an alley,

06:44.216 --> 06:45.133
late last night.

06:45.217 --> 06:46.284
I sent Morgan
and Prentiss.

06:46.352 --> 06:47.385
Only one victim?

06:47.453 --> 06:49.354
It's what he did to her
that concerns me.

06:49.421 --> 06:51.105
Morgan sent these,
also late last night.

06:51.190 --> 06:53.858
He and Prentiss
are waiting in the district.

06:53.925 --> 06:55.360
The body seems posed.

06:55.427 --> 06:57.862
Left arm raised...

06:57.929 --> 07:00.198
Oh...That's a first.
I see your concern.

07:00.265 --> 07:01.199
What?

07:01.266 --> 07:02.700
A photo
wasn't all he took.

07:02.768 --> 07:03.701
Reid, what?

07:03.769 --> 07:04.786
Her lips have been removed.

07:04.870 --> 07:05.787
Oh, my God.

07:05.871 --> 07:07.155
Maybe a trophy.

07:07.239 --> 07:09.640
Maybe he ate them?

07:09.708 --> 07:11.476
Ok, now I have that memory
burned in my mind

07:11.543 --> 07:12.610
for the rest of my life.

07:12.661 --> 07:13.811
You asked.

07:13.879 --> 07:15.296
The photo he sent
to the "Monitor"

07:15.381 --> 07:16.647
and the way
her body's posed

07:16.715 --> 07:18.299
and the mutilation,

07:18.384 --> 07:20.668
it must be a
representation of someone.

07:20.753 --> 07:23.521
At least by sending a photo, the media's
opened a line of communication.

07:23.589 --> 07:27.658
Now that he's got the media's attention,
we can expect more of these.

07:27.726 --> 07:29.827
Now for this
late-breaking news.

07:29.895 --> 07:32.897
Kelly Landis was found
dumped in an alley late last night.

07:32.965 --> 07:36.167
And I've been informed her body
was mutilated by the killer.

07:36.235 --> 07:38.069
The FBI's behavioral
analysis unit

07:38.137 --> 07:39.771
has been called in
to investigate.

07:39.838 --> 07:42.940
This is Taylor Conwright,
WVDC News.

"Fame will go by,

08:21.104 --> 08:23.889
"It goes by. I've always
known it was fickle,

08:23.940 --> 08:26.308
"so at least it's
something I experienced,

08:26.392 --> 08:28.393
but that's not where I live."

08:28.461 --> 08:30.662
Marilyn Monroe.

08:33.265 --> 08:35.900
33 years.
2 days left to retire.

08:35.952 --> 08:38.602
Not once did I have
my name in print.

08:38.655 --> 08:40.905
Now it's alongside
a 22-year-old girl

08:40.957 --> 08:42.741
left butchered in an alley.

08:42.792 --> 08:43.909
Who found her?

08:43.960 --> 08:45.244
Homeless guy.

08:45.311 --> 08:48.447
We need to compile a list
of Kelly's direct relatives,

08:48.514 --> 08:50.482
friends, co-workers,
boyfriends, everyone.

08:50.550 --> 08:53.468
When we got the photo,
I expected a ransom, not a body.

08:53.553 --> 08:55.320
This isn't about money.
It's about that.

08:55.388 --> 08:56.655
Attention.

08:56.723 --> 08:58.307
By sending in the photo,

08:58.391 --> 09:00.425
the unsub's handiwork
becomes the center of attention.

09:00.493 --> 09:03.128
It wasn't sent. It was walked
into the "Monitor" building.

09:03.196 --> 09:04.696
No one saw a thing.

09:04.764 --> 09:05.998
From here on out,
nobody talks to the press.

09:06.065 --> 09:08.867
The last thing we need is the
media naming her killer.

09:08.935 --> 09:10.702
It'll have an emotional
effect on her killer,

09:10.770 --> 09:12.871
but positive or negative,
neither one will help.

09:12.939 --> 09:14.856
You know, you guys
usually work serial murders.

09:14.941 --> 09:16.074
All we have is Kelly.

09:16.142 --> 09:17.442
What you have is unique,

09:17.510 --> 09:19.511
in fact. It's a first
for all of us.

09:19.579 --> 09:20.846
Kelly represents
someone specific

09:20.913 --> 09:22.030
to the unsub.

09:22.115 --> 09:23.315
Love and hate

09:23.366 --> 09:24.850
in equal measure.

09:24.917 --> 09:27.219
What the hell does
cutting her lips off represent?

09:27.287 --> 09:29.037
It's a fetish, an obsession
linked either

09:29.122 --> 09:32.324
to a profoundly deep love
or possibly disgust of lips.

09:32.375 --> 09:33.659
As Morgan pointed out,

09:33.726 --> 09:35.961
emotions that are in direct
conflict with one another.

09:36.029 --> 09:37.129
It's his signature.

09:37.196 --> 09:39.331
And not one
that's on any database.

09:41.634 --> 09:44.886
I love to sit
and watch people go by.

09:44.971 --> 09:47.839
You can tell a lot by
the way someone walks.

09:47.890 --> 09:50.359
The way they hold
their head.

09:50.443 --> 09:52.244
Take that lady over there--

09:52.312 --> 09:53.729
the blonde
with the ponytail,

09:53.813 --> 09:55.080
in the gray dress.
You see her?

09:55.148 --> 09:56.248
That one?

09:56.316 --> 09:58.784
No, no, no. Don't point.
That's rude.

10:00.119 --> 10:02.454
That is not a walk.

10:02.521 --> 10:04.189
She's keeping her head down

10:04.257 --> 10:05.857
and avoiding eye contact.
You know why?

10:05.908 --> 10:07.692
- Everyone's in her way.
- No.

10:07.744 --> 10:10.429
She's either late
for something or...

10:10.496 --> 10:12.130
Mad at the world.

10:13.833 --> 10:15.267
Mad at the world.

10:15.335 --> 10:17.586
That's why I've always
told you, Rhett,

10:17.670 --> 10:18.870
never have children.

10:18.921 --> 10:21.673
I'm going to go buy
some flowers.

10:21.724 --> 10:24.376
You see that,
how she glides,

10:24.444 --> 10:27.245
you can't take
your eyes off her?

10:29.248 --> 10:31.249
How do you walk?

10:31.317 --> 10:33.085
I can show you.

10:33.152 --> 10:35.270
I'd like that.

10:39.959 --> 10:41.981
The office for the Georgetown "Monitor"
is here on M street.

10:42.081 --> 10:44.115
Kelly's body was found
in Rykers Alley here.

10:44.197 --> 10:46.415
3 blocks west is where
he hand-delivered Kelly's photo.

10:46.499 --> 10:47.949
And 10 blocks farther east

10:48.034 --> 10:50.369
are offices of practically
every major media outlet.

10:50.436 --> 10:51.703
Why choose
the "Monitor"?

10:51.754 --> 10:54.589
He reads it or it's
his comfort zone.

10:54.674 --> 10:56.091
You think he lives
in Georgetown?

10:56.159 --> 10:57.742
Until we find signs
of sexual assault,

10:57.794 --> 10:59.544
we can't be sure
it's a he.

10:59.595 --> 11:01.129
It says that Kelly
lives in Alexandria

11:01.197 --> 11:02.748
but she works on the Hill.
Is that correct?

11:02.815 --> 11:05.283
She didn't have a chance.
It was her first day as a Senate Page.

11:05.351 --> 11:07.285
What time was she
supposed to report for work?

11:07.353 --> 11:10.472
9 a.m. neighbors saw her
leave in the morning.

11:10.556 --> 11:11.756
She didn't have a car.

11:11.808 --> 11:13.291
If she used the bus
or the Metro,

11:13.359 --> 11:14.459
no one saw her.

11:14.527 --> 11:16.228
Can we see a copy
of the autopsy report?

11:16.295 --> 11:18.597
Happening downstairs
as we speak.

11:18.664 --> 11:20.098
And we'd like to see
a list of everyone

11:20.166 --> 11:21.266
you've interviewed so far.

11:21.334 --> 11:22.767
It's on my desk.
I'll get it.

11:22.819 --> 11:25.070
Kelly's body was dumped
in the district.

11:25.121 --> 11:27.122
It's likely that she was
abducted and killed here, too.

11:27.206 --> 11:28.440
Then he's local.

11:28.491 --> 11:30.609
And MPD's done a comprehensive
neighborhood canvass.

11:30.676 --> 11:32.144
They have.

11:32.211 --> 11:33.912
They've probably already
interviewed the unsub.

11:37.250 --> 11:38.950
That's a great walk.

11:39.001 --> 11:40.669
Really quite wonderful.

11:40.753 --> 11:41.953
My mother says,

11:42.021 --> 11:44.139
when you're a movie star,

11:44.223 --> 11:46.825
you have to have a walk.

11:46.893 --> 11:48.760
'Cause when you're
on a screen 15 feet high,

11:48.811 --> 11:51.596
you better have a good walk.
And when you win that Oscar,

11:51.664 --> 11:55.934
you gotta walk across that
red carpet like you own it.

12:14.704 --> 12:15.754
Stunning.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.255
You think so?

12:17.323 --> 12:18.757
No, I think
you're an ugly little girl

12:18.824 --> 12:20.876
who has nothing
to give to the world.

12:22.562 --> 12:24.463
Mommy!

12:29.502 --> 12:31.436
If she was offered
food or water,

12:31.504 --> 12:33.104
she didn't accept it.

12:33.172 --> 12:36.391
Her stomach's empty,
and she's dehydrated.

12:36.476 --> 12:39.044
Not that she could have
accepted anything.

12:39.111 --> 12:41.012
She was restrained.

12:41.080 --> 12:43.915
Dr. Hecht, did you find any
signs of sexual abuse?

12:43.983 --> 12:44.916
No.

12:44.984 --> 12:46.117
Cause of death?

12:46.185 --> 12:47.319
Suffocation.

12:47.370 --> 12:49.488
But not manual
strangulation.

12:49.555 --> 12:52.224
Was the mutilation
post- or antemortem?

12:52.291 --> 12:53.708
Post.

12:58.464 --> 13:00.332
Never get used to that.

13:04.303 --> 13:07.138
There's something
in her throat.

13:15.648 --> 13:19.100
9 a.m. is a busy time of day
to be abducting someone.

13:19.185 --> 13:21.436
If she didn't know who
took her, that's high-risk.

13:21.521 --> 13:24.272
Well, maybe Agent Hotchner
and the whiz kid are wrong.

13:24.357 --> 13:26.891
Maybe she was brought into the
district by somebody she knew.

13:26.943 --> 13:28.893
No one's going to bring
a victim into D.C.

13:28.945 --> 13:31.263
Unless their base
of operations is here.

13:31.330 --> 13:32.914
This is definitely
his comfort zone.

13:32.999 --> 13:34.916
Ok, so day one,
Kelly's abducted.

13:35.001 --> 13:38.570
Day 2, the media
gets a photo of her.

13:38.621 --> 13:41.573
Day 3, her body's
found here posed.

13:41.624 --> 13:43.408
This all feels orchestrated.

13:43.476 --> 13:46.411
Well, if you orchestrated all of this,
wouldn't you want to see it?

13:46.462 --> 13:48.964
Why else
leave a body here?

13:49.048 --> 13:51.766
I'll get one of my men
to film the crowd.

13:51.851 --> 13:54.953
Morgan, isn't this crime
scene sealed off?

13:55.021 --> 13:56.321
There's someone
in here.

13:57.857 --> 14:00.492
The air must have
dislodged it,

14:00.560 --> 14:02.394
otherwise
I'd have seen it.

14:06.115 --> 14:08.333
Thanks.

14:13.239 --> 14:14.772
A page from a book?

14:14.824 --> 14:17.742
I don't know.
It's old paper.

14:17.810 --> 14:21.580
The blood and the saliva
has sort of smudged the words.

14:21.647 --> 14:23.148
There's a lot of text.

14:23.215 --> 14:28.453
It appears...
to be in old courier.

14:28.521 --> 14:30.422
You know what?

14:30.489 --> 14:32.824
It's typed, not printed.

14:32.925 --> 14:35.793
"Nothing moves in the street.

14:35.845 --> 14:38.763
"A cool breeze and gentle rain

14:38.814 --> 14:42.684
do little to silence
Robert's beating heart."

14:42.768 --> 14:44.703
From the time
Kelly was found,

14:44.770 --> 14:45.937
how long
had she been dead?

14:46.005 --> 14:47.439
Lividity indicates
half an hour.

14:47.506 --> 14:49.357
Georgetown's where
he kept her captive.

14:51.777 --> 14:55.046
Trihalomethane
was found in her hair.

14:55.114 --> 14:56.982
Chloroform?

14:57.049 --> 14:59.584
Who uses chloroform
nowadays?

14:59.652 --> 15:01.586
You know, chloroform,
the glamour shots--

15:01.654 --> 15:04.522
it all feels like a throwback
to another century.

15:12.965 --> 15:16.001
Where were you
last night?

15:16.068 --> 15:17.235
Jail.

15:17.303 --> 15:18.903
There was a homeless
man here--

15:18.971 --> 15:21.806
6 feet tall, beard,
late 40s.

15:21.874 --> 15:24.008
Impossible.

15:24.060 --> 15:27.312
No, there was definitely
somebody right here last night.

15:27.380 --> 15:29.214
This place is my place.

15:29.281 --> 15:31.916
This alley's my home.

15:31.984 --> 15:34.753
Ain't nobody down here
but me.

15:34.820 --> 15:36.254
Do we have a problem here?

15:36.322 --> 15:38.740
The homeless guy who found
Kelly's body, where is he?

15:38.824 --> 15:40.258
He was right here.

15:40.326 --> 15:43.261
He flagged down a patrol car
and he brought them back here.

15:43.329 --> 15:45.363
You mind
if I take a look?

15:45.414 --> 15:47.048
Do I have a choice?

15:59.779 --> 16:01.680
Did you write that
on the wall?

16:02.682 --> 16:04.933
Son of a bitch
wrote on my walls!

16:05.017 --> 16:07.552
No, no, hey, hey!
Don't touch that, please, sir.

16:07.620 --> 16:09.721
Sir, that is evidence
that we need.

16:09.789 --> 16:10.722
Come here.

16:10.773 --> 16:12.107
Please.

16:21.300 --> 16:24.436
"Robert hangs in the shadows,

16:24.503 --> 16:26.571
"just as his life
now hangs in the balance.

16:26.639 --> 16:30.008
Garcia and Morgan:
But life without love
is no life at all."

16:30.076 --> 16:31.776
We would be awesome together.

16:31.844 --> 16:33.178
Aren't we already?

16:33.245 --> 16:35.747
Like us, they are
perfectly matched,

16:35.815 --> 16:38.016
but the are not found
on any database.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.250
On what, then?

16:39.318 --> 16:40.418
On that piece of paper

16:40.486 --> 16:42.220
found shoved down
Kelly's throat.

16:42.271 --> 16:43.221
The same words?

16:43.289 --> 16:44.589
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

16:44.657 --> 16:46.591
Derek, what is it?
You're doing that silence.

16:46.659 --> 16:48.059
It means you're
onto something.

16:48.110 --> 16:49.644
I'll call you back.

16:50.980 --> 16:52.263
Hotch was right.

16:52.331 --> 16:53.931
You have interviewed
the unsub.

16:53.983 --> 16:55.400
How do you know that?

16:55.451 --> 16:56.701
Because the writing
on the wall is the same

16:56.769 --> 16:58.336
as what was stuffed down
Kelly's throat.

16:58.404 --> 17:00.371
The homeless man who
found Kelly's body

17:00.439 --> 17:01.740
wasn't homeless.

17:01.807 --> 17:03.541
Excuse me?

17:03.609 --> 17:05.175
He was wearing
a disguise.

17:15.988 --> 17:17.756
Read to me, Rhett.

17:17.807 --> 17:21.291
You know I love it
when you read to me.

17:21.343 --> 17:23.478
I'm tired.

17:23.561 --> 17:25.597
I'm so tired.

17:25.664 --> 17:27.866
Rhett,

17:27.933 --> 17:29.901
come upstairs
and read to me.

17:29.969 --> 17:32.470
Scene 43.

17:32.521 --> 17:34.706
You know how I love
the way you play it.

17:34.774 --> 17:37.776
Oh, I can't sleep when
you don't read to me.

17:37.843 --> 17:42.313
Baby, I need you.

17:42.364 --> 17:44.816
Coming, mom.

17:44.867 --> 17:46.451
Just a minute.

17:48.003 --> 17:50.188
Just a minute, I'm nearly done.

17:53.592 --> 17:55.160
Get up here now!

17:55.227 --> 17:57.529
Rhett?

17:57.596 --> 18:00.198
Rhett...

18:24.506 --> 18:28.056
"Agents of the BAU
investigate the Hill Ripper."

18:28.210 --> 18:30.127
Why are they saying
these things?

18:30.212 --> 18:32.746
You're so much like
your father was.

18:32.798 --> 18:33.748
Really?

18:33.815 --> 18:34.982
Tell me. Please.

18:35.050 --> 18:36.801
You're weak.

18:37.819 --> 18:39.120
What?

18:39.187 --> 18:41.889
You're weak
just like he was.

18:43.191 --> 18:45.092
I did this.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.794
Not you!
Not my father!

18:46.862 --> 18:48.796
A few bad words
from the press and look at you.

18:48.864 --> 18:51.666
"Why are they saying
all these things about me?"

18:51.733 --> 18:53.734
He was gutless
and he was pathetic,

18:53.785 --> 18:55.836
but at least your father
knew how to walk like a man!

18:55.904 --> 18:57.321
He gave you nothing.

18:57.406 --> 18:58.990
I've given you my life!

18:59.074 --> 19:01.575
And I am reminded
of that every day.

19:01.627 --> 19:04.512
Oh, please! Don't say that!

19:04.579 --> 19:06.297
Do you have any idea
what you have cost me?

19:06.381 --> 19:08.082
What I could have been?!

19:11.670 --> 19:13.387
Ohh...

19:15.257 --> 19:17.291
She looks so much like me.

19:17.359 --> 19:18.659
But she's not you, mom.

19:18.727 --> 19:20.094
Look at her.

19:20.162 --> 19:22.063
Look at her, mom!

19:25.067 --> 19:27.368
Is that the work
of a weak man?

19:28.970 --> 19:33.274
In a matter of hours, she'll be
more famous than you ever were.

19:36.712 --> 19:38.446
I can't match the words, sir,

19:38.497 --> 19:41.349
but if they're from a film,
it's got to be the 1950s.

19:41.416 --> 19:43.017
Are you sure?

19:43.085 --> 19:44.885
Well, the picture that he sent
of Kelly to the "Monitor,"

19:44.953 --> 19:45.886
Kelly's makeup, ok,

19:45.954 --> 19:48.339
the foundation
is like a pearl color

19:48.423 --> 19:49.957
and over it
is this green powder.

19:50.008 --> 19:51.676
That powder gives it
a whiter look.

19:51.760 --> 19:53.160
Her eyebrows are plucked,

19:53.228 --> 19:56.347
her cheeks are that flushed rose
hue that is totally that era.

19:56.431 --> 19:58.999
But what really seals it
is the dark eyeliner.

19:59.067 --> 20:01.001
She has bedroom eyes.

20:01.069 --> 20:02.503
That was Marilyn Monroe's
trademark.

20:02.571 --> 20:04.722
Well, if Kelly's supposed
to represent Monroe,

20:04.806 --> 20:07.775
then the text we found may be
from one of Monroe's movies.

20:07.842 --> 20:09.944
Yeah, I know,
it's not much, but...

20:10.011 --> 20:11.846
No, no, no,
it helps the profile.

20:11.913 --> 20:13.314
Sir...

20:13.365 --> 20:15.316
Garcia, I'm sorry
if I embarrassed you

20:15.384 --> 20:16.650
when I asked
about your play.

20:16.718 --> 20:18.052
I certainly
didn't mean to.

20:18.120 --> 20:20.154
Oh, oh, I know.
I just, um,

20:20.205 --> 20:22.656
really, I gotta ask you that you don't
share that with anyone, please.

20:22.724 --> 20:23.724
Of course.

20:23.792 --> 20:25.159
Oh, and one other thing.

20:25.227 --> 20:27.661
I was thinking,
Kelly was missing for 3 days,

20:27.729 --> 20:30.898
and most stories--
plays and films--

20:30.966 --> 20:32.199
I know,
have a 3-act structure.

20:32.267 --> 20:34.268
Not unlike your play.

20:34.336 --> 20:36.771
You know, I saw the original
production in New York.

20:36.838 --> 20:38.172
Oh.

20:38.240 --> 20:40.541
Well, we sort of adapted it.

20:40.609 --> 20:42.076
Good.

20:42.144 --> 20:43.778
Thanks.

20:45.764 --> 20:48.891
Penny Hanley, 19. She lives
in Arlington, works in an art gallery.

20:48.991 --> 20:50.956
Yesterday she didn't make it
to work or back home.

20:51.253 --> 20:52.953
She caught the Metro
to Union Station.

20:53.021 --> 20:54.271
Her father dropped her off.

20:54.356 --> 20:56.723
Her purse was found a few
blocks away on a side street.

20:56.775 --> 20:58.359
It's most likely
where she was abducted.

20:58.427 --> 21:00.428
Kelly was taken for 3 days.

21:00.529 --> 21:02.463
If he's holding to pattern,
Penny's already on day 2.

21:02.531 --> 21:04.231
Today the Georgetown "Monitor"

21:04.299 --> 21:05.800
will receive a photo.

21:05.867 --> 21:07.918
Whatever happens, we cannot
allow another photograph

21:08.003 --> 21:09.603
like Kelly's to be published.

21:09.671 --> 21:11.405
We need to get ahead
of the media.

21:11.473 --> 21:13.307
They've already named him
"the Hill Ripper."

21:13.375 --> 21:15.609
I want undercover units
to lock that building down.

21:15.677 --> 21:17.411
And if you see him,
let him walk in.

21:17.462 --> 21:18.963
Do not apprehend him before.

21:19.047 --> 21:20.798
We're looking for a white
male in his mid to late 40s,

21:20.882 --> 21:23.517
approximately 6 feet tall,
slim build.

21:23.585 --> 21:25.636
We think he's a local
and a loner,

21:25.720 --> 21:27.021
and he's most likely
unemployed.

21:27.088 --> 21:29.423
He's moving his victims
around the city unseen,

21:29.491 --> 21:30.991
so we know he has a vehicle.

21:31.059 --> 21:33.427
It's probably an older
model, but well maintained.

21:33.495 --> 21:34.695
What does he think
this is?

21:34.762 --> 21:37.198
A page from what
we believe is a script

21:37.265 --> 21:38.666
was found inserted
in Kelly's throat.

21:38.733 --> 21:40.334
Somehow in
the unsub's mind,

21:40.402 --> 21:42.769
Kelly seems to have
failed expectations.

21:42.821 --> 21:44.989
Although there were
no sexual interactions

21:45.073 --> 21:47.007
ante or postmortem,

21:47.075 --> 21:50.711
the removal of the lips
is in itself a sexual act.

21:50.778 --> 21:53.614
A behavior which tells us we're dealing
with a borderline personality.

21:53.682 --> 21:56.016
Based on the obvious
theatricality of the case,

21:56.084 --> 21:58.285
we think he worked
in or around the arts.

21:58.336 --> 22:02.122
3 days may represent a 3-act play,
of which Kelly was the star.

22:02.174 --> 22:04.791
Kelly was killed 3 days
after she was abducted.

22:04.843 --> 22:06.694
That means Penny
may only have a day left.

22:06.761 --> 22:08.996
Look up.

22:13.201 --> 22:15.703
Oops. I missed one.

22:30.752 --> 22:32.686
Oh, yeah.

22:36.124 --> 22:37.525
Wowza.

22:39.461 --> 22:41.328
You want to see?

22:41.396 --> 22:43.397
I just want to go home.

22:43.465 --> 22:44.532
Trust me.

22:44.599 --> 22:47.268
I've had
a lot of practice.

22:47.335 --> 22:48.636
You look great.

22:48.687 --> 22:51.705
What do you think?

22:51.773 --> 22:53.207
You like it?

22:56.645 --> 22:58.279
She didn't have it.

22:58.346 --> 22:59.947
I thought she did,
but she didn't.

23:00.015 --> 23:03.217
You have it
in spades, my dear.

23:04.352 --> 23:06.487
I don't want to be famous.

23:10.024 --> 23:13.961
We all want
to be famous.

23:14.029 --> 23:15.746
This building has 3 exits--

23:15.830 --> 23:17.248
north, south, and west.

23:17.332 --> 23:18.632
You're here
to target a woman,

23:18.700 --> 23:20.901
but you don't want
to attract attention.

23:20.969 --> 23:22.553
Well, standing
in the middle

23:22.637 --> 23:25.973
gawking at passing women, would
certainly attract attention.

23:26.040 --> 23:27.308
Like you're doing now.

23:27.375 --> 23:28.709
What's that?

23:28.777 --> 23:33.981
Just like that,
I.Q. of 187 is slashed to 60.

23:34.048 --> 23:36.150
But sitting and reading
the paper

23:36.217 --> 23:38.819
would give him
an excuse to watch

23:38.886 --> 23:40.588
without being noticed.

23:40.655 --> 23:42.990
Far enough away
not to attract attention

23:43.057 --> 23:44.575
but close enough to make sure
she's the right one.

23:44.659 --> 23:46.327
You know, she works
15 blocks east of here.

23:46.394 --> 23:49.896
Her father said she walked through
this train station every day.

23:52.734 --> 23:54.251
If he were sitting here,

23:54.336 --> 23:56.203
he's on camera.

23:57.572 --> 23:59.506
How many cameras
cover the area?

23:59.574 --> 24:02.409
3, but only 2 are operable--
cameras 8 and 7.

24:02.477 --> 24:04.878
Can you go back to
yesterday around 4 p.m.?

24:06.014 --> 24:09.016
Ok, camera 7.
There she is.

24:09.083 --> 24:10.918
Can you bring up
camera 8?

24:10.986 --> 24:13.187
Can you enlarge it
and keep it rolling, please?

24:16.191 --> 24:19.226
See the girl walking
in front of the man?

24:19.294 --> 24:21.629
Well, he's seen Penny.
Look.

24:21.696 --> 24:24.465
Can you go back to the exact
moment that he sat down?

24:26.034 --> 24:27.067
Freeze it right there.

24:27.135 --> 24:28.602
Ok, calculating
the timecode

24:28.670 --> 24:30.821
from the moment that
he left the station,

24:30.905 --> 24:33.474
he sat there
for over 3 hours.

24:33.541 --> 24:35.476
We profiled he has
his own vehicle.

24:35.543 --> 24:38.145
It was the only way he could
abduct Penny off the street.

24:38.213 --> 24:39.913
3 hours exceeds
any parking meter.

24:39.981 --> 24:41.949
Get all this footage
to Garcia.

24:44.452 --> 24:46.220
This is where
her purse was found.

24:46.287 --> 24:48.172
This has to be
where he grabbed her.

24:48.256 --> 24:49.807
High-risk but possible.

24:49.891 --> 24:52.493
Chloroform's old-school,
but it's quick.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.812
They got the guy on tape
stalking Penny.

24:54.896 --> 24:55.929
They have an I.D.
on him?

24:55.981 --> 24:57.531
Not yet.
Hotch seems to think

24:57.599 --> 24:59.900
that he may have some
type of parking permit.

24:59.967 --> 25:04.505
This entire street
is parking permit only.

25:04.572 --> 25:06.940
Well, maybe he has
some kind of work permit.

25:07.008 --> 25:08.976
A guy like this
can't hold down a job.

25:09.044 --> 25:11.412
A resident permit would give
him all the time he needed.

25:11.479 --> 25:13.681
Permits go by zone.

25:13.748 --> 25:15.683
Then we need
to shut this area down.

25:15.750 --> 25:17.718
This is where he lives.

25:21.089 --> 25:23.757
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

25:23.825 --> 25:25.659
Aah!

25:27.846 --> 25:30.130
I want to get
this scene on its feet.

25:30.164 --> 25:32.299
To do that,
you'll need these.

25:43.144 --> 25:45.345
My toes are pushing
at the end.

25:49.017 --> 25:50.584
I need some
that will fit.

25:50.652 --> 25:53.487
I can do this barefoot.

25:55.290 --> 25:58.859
It'll be quieter. You don't want
to wake your mother, do you?

25:58.927 --> 26:01.028
Good thinking.

26:06.167 --> 26:08.736
Some of the lines
are missing.

26:08.803 --> 26:11.505
We'll remember them,
won't we?

26:11.573 --> 26:16.760
Every...Last...Word.

26:20.648 --> 26:23.417
Your lips are so beautiful.

26:23.485 --> 26:26.653
What's the scene
mean to you?

26:28.790 --> 26:30.390
Love.

26:31.526 --> 26:33.727
Such extraordinary love.

26:33.795 --> 26:35.896
Mm.

26:41.336 --> 26:43.403
For a moment,
I didn't think you'd come.

26:43.471 --> 26:46.206
I had to.

26:48.209 --> 26:52.312
Tonight begins
the rest of our lives.

26:52.380 --> 26:54.281
What is it?

26:55.650 --> 26:57.651
I can't do this.

26:57.719 --> 26:59.787
Of course you can.

26:59.854 --> 27:01.755
I've got the tickets.

27:01.823 --> 27:03.157
The train is coming.

27:03.224 --> 27:05.092
We're going to make it.

27:05.160 --> 27:06.894
I'm not so sure.

27:06.961 --> 27:08.495
What is it, my sweet?

27:08.563 --> 27:10.564
What's the matter?

27:10.615 --> 27:12.466
Everything's going
to be all right.

27:13.651 --> 27:18.272
What if what we had
was all we were meant to be?

27:18.339 --> 27:20.774
My love,

27:20.842 --> 27:22.876
oh, my love,

27:22.944 --> 27:27.014
to the grave I will
carry you in my heart.

27:30.084 --> 27:31.451
Ohh!

27:33.338 --> 27:35.055
Help me!

27:35.122 --> 27:37.524
Somebody help me,
please!

27:37.592 --> 27:39.343
Help me!

27:39.427 --> 27:41.562
Somebody help me!

27:41.629 --> 27:43.814
You broke my nose! God!

27:43.898 --> 27:46.132
Help me!
Somebody help me!

27:46.184 --> 27:48.352
No! No--

27:48.436 --> 27:50.988
you sick son of a bitch!

27:52.323 --> 27:53.574
- Aah!
- Uhh!

27:53.641 --> 27:55.141
Aah!

27:55.193 --> 27:56.577
No!

28:11.593 --> 28:13.660
You were right.

28:16.164 --> 28:18.232
Your toes were too long.

28:25.640 --> 28:28.208
Aah!

28:32.288 --> 28:34.638
We closed off this entire area.
Cops are all over it.

28:35.110 --> 28:35.936
They're going
door to door

28:36.080 --> 28:38.015
where it's a 5-block-radius
with over 2,000 homes.

28:38.082 --> 28:40.651
Unless they get lucky,
that could take days.

28:40.718 --> 28:43.320
Undercover units have staked out
the Georgetown "Monitor" building.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.005
Garcia, anything
on the footage?

28:45.073 --> 28:46.690
Lab is analyzing it
frame by frame,

28:46.758 --> 28:48.525
but it was pretty clear he doesn't
know those cameras are on him.

28:48.593 --> 28:49.610
Permits?

28:49.694 --> 28:51.061
Cross-checking
with the profile,

28:51.112 --> 28:54.298
we've got male, late 40s,
truck, van, or SUV.

28:54.365 --> 28:56.833
That brings it down
to 600 potentials.

28:56.901 --> 29:00.120
Garcia, what zone covers Rykers
Alley--M street and Charlotte street?

29:00.204 --> 29:01.171
Two zones.

29:01.239 --> 29:03.040
No, that doesn't help.

29:03.107 --> 29:05.459
Well, come on, I'm the high
priestess of all things digital,

29:05.493 --> 29:06.710
but I'm not a God.

29:06.778 --> 29:08.412
What permit covers
all zones?

29:08.479 --> 29:10.180
Only one. Disabled.

29:10.248 --> 29:11.515
This guy isn't disabled.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.650
Maybe he knows someone
who is.

29:13.718 --> 29:15.335
A kid on a BMX
dropped this off

29:15.420 --> 29:17.120
at the "Monitor"
a half hour ago.

29:17.171 --> 29:19.256
Said a bum gave him
20 bucks.

29:19.307 --> 29:21.158
Well, at least
it didn't make the news.

29:21.225 --> 29:22.476
It buys us
some time, right?

29:22.560 --> 29:25.312
Until he finds
another way
to contact the media.

29:25.396 --> 29:27.130
We'll do it for him.

29:27.198 --> 29:29.516
Garcia, I need you here
as soon as possible.

29:29.601 --> 29:30.667
Sure. What for?

29:30.735 --> 29:32.869
We need him to break cover,
get out in the open.

29:32.937 --> 29:36.173
Call a press conference with every
major media outlet present.

29:36.240 --> 29:38.709
Oh, I am not the one you want
in front of that camera.

29:38.776 --> 29:41.612
Yes, you are. Detective, we
need every available unit.

29:43.414 --> 29:45.582
Hey. You're gonna be fine.

29:45.650 --> 29:48.018
No, I will not be fine. I will suck.
I will suck. And what happens then?

29:48.086 --> 29:49.353
Penelope. Penelope, stop it.

29:49.420 --> 29:51.822
We just gotta buy some time
to get ahead of this guy.

29:53.324 --> 29:54.925
He'll be watching, you mean?

29:54.993 --> 29:56.360
I'm gonna be
right by your side.

29:56.427 --> 29:59.062
Now get your butt
over here.

30:23.955 --> 30:25.489
Oh, my God.

30:34.632 --> 30:37.401
Every great movie star
has a walk.

30:39.003 --> 30:41.104
That's something
you'll never have.

30:45.176 --> 30:46.760
Sir, I've thought about this

30:46.844 --> 30:48.395
and I've decided
it's a bad idea.

30:48.479 --> 30:50.180
All you have to do
is stay calm.

30:50.231 --> 30:52.115
Don't let the room
control you.

30:52.183 --> 30:53.617
How am I supposed to do that?

30:53.685 --> 30:55.886
Keep your answers short
and to the point.

30:55.953 --> 30:57.521
Don't comment
on the Kelly Landis case.

30:57.572 --> 30:58.855
Keep the focus on Penny.

30:58.906 --> 31:00.390
No, sir, I don't think
you understand.

31:00.458 --> 31:03.226
I have a phobia about having a
video camera even pointed at me.

31:03.277 --> 31:05.228
I get all nervous
and I start to panic

31:05.279 --> 31:07.297
and I forget what I'm gonna say
and my hands get all sweaty

31:07.365 --> 31:08.749
and then my hands
start to shake.

31:08.833 --> 31:11.168
My hands are shaking
right now.

31:14.589 --> 31:16.873
I cannot do things
I am not good at,

31:16.924 --> 31:20.544
and I am not good at being in a
room full of strange people.

31:20.595 --> 31:22.629
That's why I stay
in a room 6 by 9 feet.

31:22.714 --> 31:23.714
I feel safe there.

31:23.781 --> 31:25.082
Garcia, what about
the Tolgate Theater?

31:25.149 --> 31:26.650
- What's that?
- Tolgate Theater?

31:26.718 --> 31:28.769
It's a small repertory
theater in Dean street

31:28.853 --> 31:31.321
Reid, we know what it is.
Where they do a lot of--

31:32.390 --> 31:34.758
that is not the same thing.

31:34.809 --> 31:35.926
Garcia--
I--

31:35.993 --> 31:37.477
I can't even look at you
right now.

31:37.562 --> 31:40.497
I am mad. I asked you
not to say anything.

31:40.565 --> 31:43.500
We need him to see a face and
a look that he recognizes.

31:43.568 --> 31:46.603
Well, he likes blondes,
and I'm red now.

31:46.671 --> 31:48.238
We can change that.

31:48.289 --> 31:50.373
Toward the end,
Morgan's gonna hand you a note.

31:50.441 --> 31:52.843
Take a moment,
let the group settle...

31:52.910 --> 31:54.478
And when you have
everyone's attention,

31:54.545 --> 31:55.479
read it out.

31:55.546 --> 31:56.980
You're gonna be fine.

31:57.048 --> 31:59.166
You'll be great, Red.

32:04.255 --> 32:07.023
Hey. This isn't
about the unsub.

32:07.091 --> 32:10.260
It's about the girls.
For him, it's all about making Penny famous.

32:10.328 --> 32:13.497
Then aren't we helping him
realize his dream?

32:13.564 --> 32:15.365
Come on.

32:15.433 --> 32:18.034
We get this right,
we end that dream.

32:18.102 --> 32:20.804
The press is calling him
the Hill Ripper.

32:20.855 --> 32:23.373
They're gonna want to sensationalize
this story even further.

32:23.441 --> 32:26.042
Now, they're gonna ask you
how long he kept Kelly.

32:26.110 --> 32:28.044
They're gonna ask you
how she died.

32:28.112 --> 32:31.114
Did he stab her?
Did he torture her?

32:31.182 --> 32:32.716
Did he rape her?

32:32.784 --> 32:34.701
How many others
has he killed?

32:34.786 --> 32:37.187
Garcia, you have to
make it about Penny.

32:37.255 --> 32:40.357
You let whoever has her know that
the entire world is watching,

32:40.424 --> 32:42.392
and then you make Penny
the star.

32:42.460 --> 32:47.297
All we gotta do is
get this guy to move.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.668
Hey.

32:51.736 --> 32:55.238
You can do this,
baby girl.

32:56.274 --> 32:58.225
Give me your bag.

33:03.447 --> 33:05.148
Ok.

33:06.617 --> 33:09.119
Penny Hanley went missing
2 days ago.

33:09.186 --> 33:11.855
We have received
over 3,000 calls.

33:11.906 --> 33:14.424
Her family is obviously
deeply worried

33:14.492 --> 33:17.377
and is looking forward
to her prompt and safe return.

33:17.461 --> 33:20.196
Isn't Penny Hanley yet another
victim of the Hill Ripper?

33:20.248 --> 33:22.365
Right now, all we know
is that Penny is missing.

33:22.416 --> 33:23.533
Who sent that photo in

33:23.601 --> 33:25.302
just like
the Kelly Landis case?

33:25.369 --> 33:26.703
We'd like to take
this opportunity

33:26.771 --> 33:28.038
to reach out to the public.

33:28.105 --> 33:30.707
Penny was last seen here,
leaving Union Station.

33:30.758 --> 33:32.893
You mean she was taken
by the Hill Ripper.

33:32.977 --> 33:35.946
Rumors are that Kelly Landis
was found with her lips cut off.

33:36.013 --> 33:38.815
We are not prepared to discuss
the details of Kelly's case.

33:38.883 --> 33:41.685
Isn't the mutilation, if fact,
what you call a signature?

33:41.752 --> 33:44.387
Penny Hanley's name
has captured the attention

33:44.438 --> 33:46.406
of not only the nation,

33:46.490 --> 33:48.191
but also the entire world.

33:48.259 --> 33:49.759
This photo is the most
recent image...

33:49.827 --> 33:51.661
You hear that?
The whole world knows who you are.

33:51.729 --> 33:53.830
We believe it was taken
and sent by the person...

33:53.898 --> 33:55.632
I'm so thirsty.
I need water.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.634
She never got
that kind of attention.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.636
They love you.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.171
Penny Hanley.

34:01.239 --> 34:02.839
The whole world
knows your name.

34:02.907 --> 34:05.008
I want to say something. I want to say
something to the sick son of a bitch

34:05.076 --> 34:06.543
that has my daughter.

34:06.594 --> 34:09.312
Mr. Hanley, we all
want to find your daughter,

34:09.380 --> 34:10.413
Daddy. But you really
need to calm down.

34:10.481 --> 34:11.915
Let daddy talk.
Come on, daddy,

34:11.983 --> 34:14.117
I want to hear what you have
to say about this little girl.

34:14.185 --> 34:16.518
Mr. Hanley,
don't do this.

34:16.587 --> 34:19.322
You know, I say something,
she dies,

34:19.389 --> 34:22.893
I plead for her life, she dies.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.862
I don't have any money, my
wife passed away 2 years ago.

34:25.929 --> 34:29.866
She is all I have, and if this
sick bastard gets away with this--

34:29.934 --> 34:31.234
just let me say something.

34:33.871 --> 34:35.822
Taylor Conwright,
WVDC News.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.174
Prentiss and Reid are
moving north down M street.

34:38.242 --> 34:40.476
What would you
like to say to the man
who has your daughter?

34:40.578 --> 34:42.312
She's losing the room.
Morgan's gotta do this now.

34:42.380 --> 34:45.148
If the Hill Ripper is watching,
what would you tell him?

34:45.216 --> 34:46.632
The M.E. said
I hope this works.

34:46.717 --> 34:50.337
Kelly was killed only a half
an hour before she was dumped.

34:50.420 --> 34:52.806
That means he must have
killed her in his car.

34:58.863 --> 35:00.897
My little girl right now
is in your hands.

35:00.965 --> 35:03.033
That's right.
That's right.

35:03.100 --> 35:04.167
She is in my hands.

35:04.235 --> 35:06.336
And what did you do?
Nothing.

35:06.404 --> 35:08.004
Maybe she's already
with God.

35:08.072 --> 35:11.691
Either way, your life
will be in my hands.

35:13.077 --> 35:15.545
Ladies and
gentlemen, I have
just received this...

35:15.613 --> 35:16.980
He's going to find you.

35:17.048 --> 35:18.331
Shh! Shh!

35:18.416 --> 35:20.750
...That the general public
reduce their movements

35:20.818 --> 35:23.720
around M street, Georgetown,
for the next few hours.

35:23.788 --> 35:25.522
Do you have a lead
in the Hill Ripper case?

35:25.589 --> 35:28.425
Agent Garcia, do you have
a lead in the ripper case?

35:28.492 --> 35:30.660
No, we don't.
We have an address.

35:38.936 --> 35:41.271
Rhett, what have you
done to us now?

35:41.339 --> 35:42.806
Why can't you
get anything right?

35:42.857 --> 35:45.175
I got this, mom. I got this.
Just don't answer the door, ok?

35:45.242 --> 35:46.359
Rhett, please
don't leave me.

35:46.444 --> 35:47.694
I can't be
in this house alone.

35:47.778 --> 35:49.896
I hate the dark.
You know I hate the dark.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.898
I love you, mom.
Just go upstairs and turn out the lights

35:51.949 --> 35:53.817
and do not answer
the door.

36:07.976 --> 36:09.760
If he's moving,
he's moving now.

36:16.301 --> 36:20.187
Slow down.
There, down the alley.

36:27.066 --> 36:28.088
Reid, where are you?

36:28.188 --> 36:30.940
We're headed south down Jackson street.
There's hardly anything moving.

36:31.331 --> 36:34.333
Except cop cars.
We've seen 5 in the last 10 minutes.

36:34.418 --> 36:37.219
Hotch, if he's out here,
he's got nowhere to go.

36:43.226 --> 36:44.860
Life without love...

36:45.862 --> 36:47.797
Is no life at all.

37:18.795 --> 37:20.713
Back up.

37:23.166 --> 37:26.369
Aah! No!

37:26.436 --> 37:28.304
Ohh! Ohh!

37:28.355 --> 37:30.439
There's somebody in there.

37:32.309 --> 37:35.311
No!

37:42.018 --> 37:43.319
FBI!

37:50.293 --> 37:52.094
Call an ambulance.
Penny.

37:52.162 --> 37:54.547
Penny, it's ok.
You're gonna be all right.

37:55.916 --> 37:58.033
Prentiss, Reid,
unsub is headed south.

37:58.101 --> 37:59.468
He just passed you.

37:59.536 --> 38:01.470
There's an ambulance
on its way.

38:03.707 --> 38:07.042
Penny, your dad's going to
meet us at the hospital.

38:08.478 --> 38:10.613
He got away,
but you hit him.

38:10.680 --> 38:12.648
We found traces of blood
down the alley.

38:12.716 --> 38:14.433
K-9 units
are on the way.

38:15.485 --> 38:17.086
We'll get him, though.
I promise.

38:17.154 --> 38:18.087
Agent Hotchner.

38:18.155 --> 38:19.088
Yes?

38:19.156 --> 38:20.389
Please don't leave me.

38:20.457 --> 38:21.741
Go ahead.
We've got this.

38:21.825 --> 38:23.225
Thank you.

38:29.366 --> 38:31.700
This car has
a disabled permit.

38:31.768 --> 38:33.402
Registered to who?

38:33.470 --> 38:36.739
May Walden. The unsub
is rhett Walden, her son.

38:36.807 --> 38:39.291
Yeah, guys, we have an address.
1503 Hope street.

38:39.376 --> 38:41.293
Oh, my gosh.

38:41.378 --> 38:42.912
What?

38:42.979 --> 38:46.916
The photo--it's exactly
the same as Kelly and Penny.

38:46.983 --> 38:48.184
When was it taken?

38:48.251 --> 38:50.686
1956. It's a set photo
from a movie called

38:50.754 --> 38:52.188
"Reflection of Desire."

38:52.255 --> 38:54.523
May was 19
when this was taken.

38:54.591 --> 38:56.425
She's got to be
over 70 by now.

38:56.493 --> 38:58.027
Yeah. M street,
Rykers Alley,

38:58.094 --> 38:59.528
they were all locations
on this film.

38:59.596 --> 39:02.698
It was the only movie
she ever made, and...

39:02.766 --> 39:05.468
she was 4 months pregnant
when this picture was taken.

39:05.535 --> 39:06.702
Which ended her career.

39:06.770 --> 39:07.937
And the father?

39:08.004 --> 39:10.639
Co-star.

39:12.275 --> 39:14.777
Derek, do you think she made
her son do all of this?

39:14.845 --> 39:17.779
Penelope, I think she made her
son do a lot more than this.

39:17.831 --> 39:20.866
Rhett Walden,
this is the police!

39:20.934 --> 39:22.434
We know you're in there.

39:22.502 --> 39:24.720
Come out with your hands up.

39:24.788 --> 39:27.823
You hear that, mommy?

39:27.891 --> 39:30.593
They're calling for us.

39:31.795 --> 39:33.629
I told you this day would come.

39:33.697 --> 39:36.065
You didn't believe it,
but here it is.

39:39.069 --> 39:40.536
Are you ready?

39:44.841 --> 39:47.743
I'm ready,
my sweet love.

39:47.811 --> 39:49.512
This is the police.

39:49.579 --> 39:50.579
We know you're in there.

39:50.647 --> 39:52.348
Come out with your hands up.

39:52.415 --> 39:54.416
He's coming out.

40:00.123 --> 40:03.158
What if all we have

40:03.226 --> 40:05.544
is all we were meant
to be?

40:05.629 --> 40:08.197
My love,

40:08.265 --> 40:10.165
oh, my love...

40:11.334 --> 40:15.137
To my grave I will
carry you in my heart.

40:35.058 --> 40:36.659
Get down on the ground!

40:40.247 --> 40:41.997
Need a medic!

40:50.473 --> 40:52.575
Rossi.

40:52.642 --> 40:54.643
Her lips.

40:55.812 --> 40:57.346
They're Kelly's.

41:20.136 --> 41:21.070
Here.

41:21.137 --> 41:24.173
Oh, what a gentleman.

41:25.675 --> 41:27.593
Excuse me, missy,
but when did you

41:27.677 --> 41:29.094
plan on telling me?

41:29.179 --> 41:30.546
Oh, I wasn't
gonna tell you.

41:30.597 --> 41:33.265
We all have things
for ourselves.

41:33.350 --> 41:36.268
You know, you have property,
I have the theater.

41:36.353 --> 41:38.354
Can you at least tell me
what it's about?

41:38.421 --> 41:41.290
Mm-hmm. It's about a woman who's
attacked by a serial killer.

41:41.358 --> 41:42.958
But she catches him
and she knocks him out,

41:43.026 --> 41:44.460
and she keeps him
for days.

41:44.527 --> 41:46.061
Garcia, of all the plays
in the world,

41:46.129 --> 41:47.396
you choose something
like that?

41:47.464 --> 41:48.647
I get to vent.

41:48.732 --> 41:50.733
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:50.800 --> 41:52.534
How does it end?

41:54.738 --> 41:58.007
If I told you that,
it wouldn't be a surprise,

41:58.074 --> 41:59.291
would it?

42:08.985 --> 42:12.755
I believe humanity
was born from conflict.

42:12.822 --> 42:17.092
Maybe that's why in all
of us lives a dark side.

42:17.143 --> 42:19.662
Some of us embrace it.

42:19.729 --> 42:22.331
Some have no choice.

42:22.399 --> 42:26.235
The rest of us fight it.

42:26.302 --> 42:28.037
In the end,

42:28.104 --> 42:30.906
it's as natural
as the air we breathe.

42:30.974 --> 42:33.342
At some point,

42:33.410 --> 42:35.577
we're forced
to face the truth.

42:38.515 --> 42:40.315
Ourselves.
