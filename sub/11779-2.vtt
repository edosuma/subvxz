THE TEXTURE IN THE FRONT CLAWS

09:22.228 --> 09:22.937
SO NOW YOU GOT TO TRY
TO JUST CLEAN IT UP.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.022
- KEITH.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.607
- THE SHADOW'S
JUST A LITTLE BIT WEIRD.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.609
THERE'S A LOT OF LEGS
THAT DON'T GIVE A SHADOW.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.820
IT MAKES IT
A LITTLE IFFY FOR ME.

09:30.903 --> 09:31.862
- DAVID.
- INSTEAD OF TRYING TO DO

09:31.946 --> 09:34.407
THIS CRAZY PHOTOREALISTIC
PORTRAIT,

09:34.490 --> 09:36.659
YOU JUST GO IN
AND DO THE TATTOO AS A TATTOO.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.703
YOU DID LESS AND MADE IT MORE.

09:38.786 --> 09:40.871
THAT'S A GREAT CHOICE.
- LYDIA.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.290
- YEAH, I WOULD SAY OVERALL,

09:42.373 --> 09:43.291
THE DIMENSION IN THIS TATTOO,
AS THE SPIDER GOES BACK,

09:43.374 --> 09:44.709
YOU SHOULD FEEL A LITTLE MORE OF

09:44.792 --> 09:46.586
THE DEPTH
AND THE DARKNESS OF THAT,

09:46.669 --> 09:49.213
AND IT WOULD MAKE
THAT SOFTER GRAY SHADOW

09:49.297 --> 09:50.339
YOU HAVE UNDERNEATH IT
REALLY POP.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.050
- JAY.
- IT NEEDS TO BE BIGGER.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.553
YOU BRING THE TEXTURE OF THAT
SCORPION ALIVE IN THE CLAWS,

09:55.636 --> 09:57.388
BUT YOU DON'T REALLY
GIVE IT DIMENSION,

09:57.471 --> 09:59.056
AND THE LEGS
ARE ALL TIED TOGETHER.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.684
IT JUST DOESN'T GIVE IT
THE LIFT FROM THE SKIN.

10:01.767 --> 10:02.935
- SAUSAGE.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.854
- YOU DID HIT SOME NICE
DIMENSION UP IN THE TAIL.

10:04.937 --> 10:05.855
- BUT IT IS REALLY DARK,

10:05.938 --> 10:07.732
AND THE SHADOW
KIND OF OVERPOWERS

10:07.815 --> 10:08.941
THE IMAGE A LITTLE BIT.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.027
I THINK THAT'S GONNA HURT YOU.
- JIM.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.320
- IT'S A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING.

10:12.403 --> 10:13.446
THE TARANTULA COULD HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE DARKER

10:13.529 --> 10:14.530
AND THE SHADOW COULD HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE LIGHTER

10:14.613 --> 10:15.656
SO THEY STOOD APART
FROM EACH OTHER.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.116
- IF YOU WOULD HAVE USED
MORE BLACK

10:17.199 --> 10:18.451
IN THE ACTUAL BODY ITSELF,

10:18.534 --> 10:20.244
IT WOULD HAVE MADE IT
MORE READABLE.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.788
- KYLE.
NICE TO HAVE YOU

10:22.872 --> 10:25.541
TATTOOING ON THIS COMPETITION.
- THE TATTOO'S TOO LITTLE.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.626
IF THE TATTOO WAS BIGGER
AND YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE SPACE

10:27.710 --> 10:29.378
FOR THE SCORPION ITSELF
TO BE READABLE,

10:29.462 --> 10:30.880
THAT WOULD HAVE ADDED
A LOT MORE DIMENSION

10:30.963 --> 10:32.715
TO THAT REALLY HEAVY BLACK
CAST SHADOW.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.216
IT'S HARD TO READ WHAT THAT IS.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.718
- I'M BACK IN HELL AGAIN.

10:35.801 --> 10:39.722
{\an8}OH, YES, IT IS A COMPETITION.
IT'S PRESSURE, IT'S HIGH STAKES,

10:39.805 --> 10:43.184
{\an8}AND MAYBE I WASN'T AS PREPARED
AS I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE.

10:43.267 --> 10:44.935
- THIS WAS THE FIRST OFFICIAL
FLASH CHALLENGE.

10:45.019 --> 10:48.230
THEY WERE DOING DIMENSION.
HOW'D THEY DO OVERALL?

10:48.314 --> 10:49.398
- SOME PEOPLE DID IT JUST RIGHT

10:49.482 --> 10:50.983
AND OTHER PEOPLE'S TOTALLY
LOST IT.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.234
- HONE IN ON A TOP THREE.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.278
- I WOULD SAY HALO'S DEFINITELY
ONE OF 'EM.

10:54.362 --> 10:57.573
SHADING WAS VERY NICE AND THERE
WAS A DEFINITE SEPARATION

10:57.656 --> 11:00.242
FROM THE SHADOW
TO THE ACTUAL BUG ITSELF.

11:00.326 --> 11:03.329
- MELISSA, HER NICE SOFT SHADOW
GAVE IT JUST A LITTLE BIT

11:03.412 --> 11:05.414
OF LIFT OFF THE SKIN,
AND I THINK SHE DID A GOOD JOB.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.749
- MATTI DID THE BEST SHADOW

11:06.832 --> 11:09.377
WITH THAT NICE GRADATION
IN THE SHADOW.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.128
REALLY MADE THAT DIMENSION
BELIEVABLE.

11:11.212 --> 11:14.090
- SOMEBODY WHO'S STRUGGLED
A LOT TODAY, ASHLEY.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.133
- THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT
OF THE DAY FOR ME.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.927
SHE GOT RATTLED AND SHE LOOKS
PRETTY UPSET ABOUT IT.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.846
- I'LL TELL YOU WHO
I'M SURPRISED WITH--KYLE.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.932
KYLE SUPPOSEDLY IS THE GUY
THAT AMERICA WANTED BACK.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.601
THOSE OUTLINES ON HIS TATTOO
WERE SCRATCHY.

11:25.684 --> 11:27.436
- SO IT'S CLEAR THAT WE KNOW WHO
THE BOTTOM OF THE FIELD IS,

11:27.520 --> 11:28.437
AND I THINK WE HAVE A WINNER.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.064
WANT TO LET 'EM KNOW?

11:30.147 --> 11:32.692
both: LET'S DO IT.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.276
- TODAY, WE ASKED YOU
TO SHOW DIMENSION BY TATTOOING

11:34.360 --> 11:38.864
A BUG THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE
IT'S CRAWLING ON YOUR CANVAS.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.742
SOME OF YOU SUCCEEDED.
MELISSA.

11:41.826 --> 11:45.538
- YOURS STOOD OUT AS JUST BEING
SIMPLE AND CLEAN AND LEGIBLE.

11:45.621 --> 11:46.664
- THANK YOU.
- MATTI.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.332
- YOU DID A REALLY NICE
SHADOW ON IT.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.626
IT SHOWED A LOT OF DIMENSION
AND IT WAS VERY CLEAN.

11:50.709 --> 11:52.002
- THANK YOU.
- HALO.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.130
- THE DETAIL YOU PUT INTO
THE FRONT OF THE SCORPION

11:54.213 --> 11:56.132
WITH ALL THE TEXTURE
IN THE CLAWS AND THEN

11:56.215 --> 11:57.591
THE TAIL COMING BACK AROUND,
I THINK IT'S AN EFFECT

11:57.675 --> 12:00.761
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WENT FOR
TODAY BUT DIDN'T CAPTURE.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.930
- THANK YOU.
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

12:04.473 --> 12:05.933
THE WINNER OF TODAY'S
FLASH CHALLENGE IS...

12:09.562 --> 12:13.816
HALO.
[all clapping]

12:13.899 --> 12:16.652
- GREAT JOB, BUDDY.

12:16.735 --> 12:18.779
- OVERALL,
IT WAS A GREAT EXECUTION.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.281
GREAT PLACEMENT.
- THANK YOU GUYS, VERY MUCH.

12:20.364 --> 12:22.283
- CONGRATULATIONS.

12:22.366 --> 12:23.617
YOU WILL HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN

12:23.701 --> 12:26.036
THE HUMAN CANVASES
AT THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.371
- I THINK I SHOULD HAVE WON
THIS CHALLENGE.

12:27.455 --> 12:28.706
MINE WAS BETTER.

12:28.789 --> 12:31.542
{\an8}OBVIOUSLY MY BIGGEST THREAT NOW,
AFTER THIS CHALLENGE, IS HALO.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.002
{\an8}- HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT
AND GET READY

12:33.085 --> 12:36.046
{\an8}TO MEET YOUR CANVASES FOR
THE NEXT ELIMINATION TATTOO.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.594
{\an8}- THIS IS ABOUT TO GET UGLY.

12:41.677 --> 12:43.095
I DON'T WANT TO
HAVE TO KILL YOU.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.639
- YOU'RE IN A COMPETITION.
BUCK UP OR GET THE [bleep] OUT.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.016
- I DON'T WANT TO BE
IN THIS HOUSE!

12:51.604 --> 12:53.147
- GOOD JOB, BRO.

12:53.230 --> 12:55.566
YOU DID A REAL GOOD JOB, MAN.
- I WASN'T EXPECTING

12:55.649 --> 12:56.859
TO WIN THAT ONE AT ALL.

12:56.942 --> 12:59.695
- I CAN SEE WHY THEY PICKED YOU.
IT WAS REALLY CLEAN.

12:59.778 --> 13:01.697
- GO ON, ASK ME HOW I FEEL ABOUT
BEING THE MAYOR OF SUCK CITY.

13:01.780 --> 13:04.992
I MEAN, IF I HAD
A LITTLE MORE TIME,

13:05.075 --> 13:07.870
IT WOULD HAVE NEVER LOOKED
LIKE THAT.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.205
I WASN'T EVEN GONNA DO IT.
HOPEFULLY TOMORROW

13:09.288 --> 13:12.041
I'LL HAVE MORE TIME
AND I'LL HAVE A PICTURE...

13:12.124 --> 13:13.959
- [laughs]
- THAT'S RIGHT.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.294
- I'M SORRY WHILE I LAUGH
WHEN YOU'RE SAYING,

13:15.377 --> 13:16.670
"I'LL HAVE MORE TIME."
I'M LIKE, "WELL, NO."

13:16.754 --> 13:19.048
AT NO POINT DOES THIS
GET EASIER.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.341
- I NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME.

13:20.424 --> 13:21.634
- WELL, YOU'RE GONNA
GET [bleep].

13:21.717 --> 13:22.885
WE ARE IN A COMPETITION.

13:22.968 --> 13:26.514
{\an8}- KYLE THINKS HE KNOWS
THE INS AND OUTS OF EVERYTHING,

13:26.597 --> 13:27.723
{\an8}AND I DON'T GIVE A [bleep]
WHAT HE THINKS.

13:27.806 --> 13:28.390
- THIS AIN'T NO JOKE.
I MEAN--

13:28.474 --> 13:31.060
- OKAY, THEN I QUIT.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.353
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT
TO [bleep] HEAR?

13:32.436 --> 13:34.230
- THAT'S A LITTLE EXTREME.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.564
- OKAY, I HATE IT HERE.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.150
- YOU'RE IN A COMPETITION.
BUCK UP, CAMPER.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.069
NUT UP OR GET THE [bleep] OUT.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.530
- OKAY, I CAN'T WAIT TILL YOU
DO EVERY TATTOO PERFECTLY.

13:42.613 --> 13:43.989
- I SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT
THE BOTTOM TODAY,

13:44.073 --> 13:45.157
AND I SAID IT ALREADY!

13:45.241 --> 13:46.492
- I DIDN'T HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.410
- WELL, IT'S BECAUSE
YOU WENT CRYING OUTSIDE!

13:48.494 --> 13:50.913
- OKAY, DICKHEAD.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.748
- I'M THE WHOLE DICK, BITCH.
I'M GRADUATED.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.750
- YOU'RE SO COOL.
- ASHLEY,

13:54.833 --> 13:55.876
FIND THAT CHAMPION
INSIDE OF YOU,

13:55.960 --> 13:57.002
'CAUSE RIGHT NOW THE ATTITUDE

13:57.086 --> 13:58.754
THAT YOU'VE GOT
WILL NOT MAKE IT.

13:58.837 --> 13:59.755
- OOH.

13:59.838 --> 14:01.257
- WHERE YOU GOING?
GET BACK HERE!

14:01.340 --> 14:03.133
YOU JUST SIT DOWN ON 'EM AND GO,
"YEAH, I [bleep] UP."

14:03.217 --> 14:05.219
- DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!

14:05.302 --> 14:06.887
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
LISTEN TO ME.

14:06.971 --> 14:07.930
- I'M NOT ONE OF YOUR KIDS.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.140
- THEN STOP ACTING LIKE A CHILD.

14:10.224 --> 14:11.559
IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT YOU.

14:11.642 --> 14:13.727
- I DON'T WANT TO BE IN
THIS COMPETITION ANYMORE.

14:13.811 --> 14:16.188
UGH, I DON'T WANT TO BE
IN THIS HOUSE!

14:16.272 --> 14:18.691
- HOLY [bleep]!

14:25.906 --> 14:27.074
- OOH, MAMA!

14:29.743 --> 14:31.954
- LOOK AT THIS PLACE.
- MY OWN ROOM!

14:32.037 --> 14:34.206
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- YEAH, SHOPS!

14:36.667 --> 14:39.295
- WELCOME TO YOUR FIRST
ELIMINATION TATTOO.

14:39.378 --> 14:43.257
THE ELIMINATION TATTOO DECIDES
WHO STAYS AND WHO GOES HOME.

14:43.340 --> 14:46.719
NOT ONLY WILL YOU BE JUDGED
BY OLIVER PECK, CHRIS NUNEZ,

14:46.802 --> 14:48.637
AND MYSELF, BUT ONCE AGAIN
THIS SEASON,

14:48.721 --> 14:49.805
VIEWERS AT HOME WILL SCOUR

14:49.888 --> 14:52.808
EVERY DETAIL OF
YOUR ELIMINATION TATTOOS

14:52.891 --> 14:55.477
AT INKMASTER.SPIKE.COM, THEN

14:55.561 --> 14:56.979
THEY WILL VOTE FOR THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THINK IS BEST

14:57.062 --> 15:00.816
USING THE SAME CRITERIA
THAT THE JUDGES USE.

15:00.899 --> 15:03.485
AMERICA'S VOTES WILL HAVE
A MASSIVE IMPACT

15:03.569 --> 15:05.029
ON THE LIVE FINALE.

15:05.112 --> 15:07.698
{\an8}- I REALLY UNDERSTAND THE POWER
OF AMERICA VOTING.

15:07.781 --> 15:11.160
{\an8}I BENEFITED FROM IT HUGELY AND
I HOPE TO DO THE SAME AGAIN.

15:11.243 --> 15:12.786
- IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

15:12.870 --> 15:15.581
YOU'RE PERMANENTLY TATTOOING
HUMAN CANVASES.

15:15.664 --> 15:17.166
IT'S CRUCIAL THAT
YOU MAKE THEM HAPPY

15:17.249 --> 15:20.127
BECAUSE AFTER
EVERY ELIMINATION TATTOO,

15:20.210 --> 15:21.295
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
WILL VOTE ON

15:21.378 --> 15:24.298
THE ONE TATTOO THAT THEY THINK
IS THE WORST.

15:24.381 --> 15:27.343
THE VERDICT WILL PUT ONE ARTIST
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

15:28.927 --> 15:30.763
THERE IS ONE MORE THING
THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.059
THIS SEASON,
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER

15:35.142 --> 15:36.894
TO WIN BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

15:36.977 --> 15:40.189
THE WINNER OF THE BEST TATTOO
OF THE DAY

15:40.272 --> 15:42.650
WILL ALSO PUT ONE ARTIST UP
FOR ELIMINATION.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.193
- OOH.
- OH!

15:44.276 --> 15:47.196
- [laughs]
- OH, [bleep].

15:47.279 --> 15:50.741
{\an8}- I NEED TO THROW UP.
THIS IS A GIANT CURVEBALL.

15:50.824 --> 15:54.912
{\an8}- THIS IS NO LONGER WHOEVER DOES
A BAD TATTOO, THEY GO HOME.

15:54.995 --> 15:57.373
{\an8}NOW IT CHANGES TO THE POINT
WHERE IF YOU DO THE BEST TATTOO,

15:57.456 --> 15:59.500
{\an8}YOU GET TO SEND SOMEONE ELSE
OUT THE DOOR.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.710
{\an8}- THIS IS ABOUT TO GET UGLY.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.713
- THIS WEEK WE HAVE
A VERY SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE.

16:04.797 --> 16:08.008
FROM LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA,
SPECIALIZING IN REALISM

16:08.092 --> 16:10.886
AND BLACK AND GRAY,
MR. TOMMY MONTOYA.

16:10.969 --> 16:13.013
[all clapping]

16:15.057 --> 16:17.226
- MY SPECIALTY
IS BLACK AND GRAY.

16:17.309 --> 16:21.105
ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH
REALISM, I LOVE DOING IT.

16:21.188 --> 16:22.981
{\an8}I'M JUST GONNA KEEP IT REAL,
YOU KNOW, WHY SUGARCOAT IT?

16:23.065 --> 16:25.150
{\an8}I JUST HOPE I DON'T SEE
ANY BAD TATTOOS,

16:25.234 --> 16:28.862
{\an8}'CAUSE
I'M GONNA LET 'EM HAVE IT.

16:28.946 --> 16:31.198
{\an8}- THIS WEEK,
WE'RE TESTING DIMENSION.

16:31.281 --> 16:35.452
{\an8}- DIMENSION IS SHOWING DEPTH,
TEXTURE, MOVEMENT.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.413
{\an8}JUST NOT SOMETHING FLAT.

16:37.496 --> 16:40.457
{\an8}- FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE,
YOU MUST TATTOO AN OBJECT

16:40.541 --> 16:43.460
{\an8}SO RECOGNIZABLE
THAT ANY INCONSISTENCIES

16:43.544 --> 16:45.671
{\an8}WILL BE UNDENIABLE...

16:45.754 --> 16:47.756
{\an8}AN EYEBALL.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.217
{\an8}- PERFECT CIRCLES ARE THE
BIGGEST CHALLENGE IN AN EYEBALL.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.095
{\an8}IT'S VERY EASY TO SEE
ANY JAGGED LINE,

16:53.178 --> 16:54.847
{\an8}ANY IMPERFECTNESS IN THE CIRCLE.

16:54.930 --> 16:56.515
{\an8}- IS THAT THE ONLY CRITERIA,
IS THAT

16:56.598 --> 16:59.059
{\an8}WE'RE SHOWING DIMENSION
AND WE'RE TATTOOING AN EYEBALL?

16:59.143 --> 17:00.936
{\an8}EVERYTHING ELSE IS UP TO US?
- IT DOES NEED TO BE REALISM,

17:01.019 --> 17:03.355
{\an8}OPEN FOR BLACK AND GRAY
OR COLOR.

17:03.439 --> 17:04.647
{\an8}- EYEBALLS ARE TRICKY, MAN.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.442
{\an8}YOU CAN EITHER MAKE 'EM
LOOK REALLY REAL

17:06.525 --> 17:09.111
{\an8}OR THEY CAN LOOK LIKE A COUPLE
OF CIRCLES LUMPED IN TOGETHER.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.363
{\an8}- WELL, LET'S MEET
YOUR CANVASES.

17:14.907 --> 17:17.994
{\an8}HALO, YOU WON
THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

17:18.078 --> 17:22.124
{\an8}YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER TO ASSIGN
ALL THE HUMAN CANVASES.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.584
{\an8}- WHAT YOU THINKIN' ABOUT
GETTIN', BUD?

17:23.666 --> 17:24.877
{\an8}- I'M GONNA GET AN EYEBALL
AT THE BASE OF MY NECK.

17:24.960 --> 17:29.256
{\an8}- MY STRATEGY IS TO GIVE SOME OF
THE STRONGER ARTISTS PIECES

17:29.339 --> 17:31.425
{\an8}THAT I KNOW THEY'LL SHINE ON SO
I CAN SEE WHAT THEY'RE GOOD AT,

17:31.508 --> 17:33.135
{\an8}AND I CAN SEE WHAT
THEIR WEAKNESSES ARE.

17:33.218 --> 17:34.762
- I'M GONNA HAVE MY DAUGHTER'S

17:34.845 --> 17:37.014
REALISTIC EYEBALL
RIGHT ON MY THROAT.

17:37.097 --> 17:39.057
- THINK YOU CAN TOUGH
THAT ONE OUT?

17:39.141 --> 17:40.601
- SURE CAN.

17:40.684 --> 17:42.978
- I STILL THINK THE BIGGEST
THREATS RIGHT NOW ARE GONNA BE

17:43.061 --> 17:44.396
MATTI AND SAUSAGE.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.814
- I'D LIKE TO GET AN EYEBALL
ON MY PALM.

17:45.898 --> 17:46.815
- ON THE PALM OF YOUR HAND?

17:46.899 --> 17:48.317
- [whistles]
- YES, SIR.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.904
- ON THE PALM, THE SKIN SUCKS.
IT DOESN'T HEAL RIGHT.

17:51.987 --> 17:53.781
{\an8}YOU CAN'T MAKE CLEAN LINES
THROUGH IT.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.158
{\an8}- NO WAY.
ONLY AN IDIOT ASKS FOR

17:56.241 --> 17:58.869
{\an8}A REALISTIC TATTOO IN THE PALM
OF THEIR HAND.

17:58.952 --> 18:00.788
{\an8}- I WAS THINKIN' ABOUT GETTIN'
A HAZELISH-TYPE

18:00.871 --> 18:03.290

- THERE IS A VAST MAJORITY

18:03.373 --> 18:04.666
{\an8}OF THESE CANVASES
I DON'T WANT TO TATTOO.

18:04.750 --> 18:08.045
{\an8}A LOT OF 'EM BECAUSE OF THE FACT
THAT THEY WANT REALISTIC EYES

18:08.128 --> 18:11.298
{\an8}ON PARTS OF THE BODY THAT ARE
VERY DIFFICULT TO TATTOO.

18:11.381 --> 18:12.341

A REALISTIC EYE.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.010

RIGHT IN THE DITCH.

18:15.093 --> 18:17.054
{\an8}WHO LIKES WORKIN' ON DITCHES?

18:17.137 --> 18:18.180
{\an8}SOME OF THESE ARE ROUGH.

18:18.263 --> 18:21.433
{\an8}HOPE I'VE MADE SOME FRIENDS
ALONG THE WAY,

18:21.517 --> 18:22.726
{\an8}'CAUSE I'M ABOUT TO SCREW
EVERYONE ELSE.

18:22.810 --> 18:26.480
{\an8}- IS HE GONNA GIVE ME THIS PALM?
IS HE GONNA GIVE ME THAT THROAT?

18:26.563 --> 18:28.232
{\an8}WE WERE NECK-AND-NECK
IN THE LAST CHALLENGE.

18:28.315 --> 18:30.275
I THINK HE'S GOIN' FOR THE KILL
ON THIS ONE.

18:33.278 --> 18:36.031
- CANVASES, PLEASE READ
THE ARTIST'S NAME

18:36.115 --> 18:38.283
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL.
- [sighs]

18:38.367 --> 18:39.535
- GENTLE JAY.
- WHAT'S UP, MAN?

18:39.618 --> 18:41.453
- LYDIA.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.413
- HALO.

18:43.497 --> 18:46.250
- PLEASE NOT THE PALM.
PLEASE NOT THE PALM.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.168
{\an8}PLEASE NOT THE PALM.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.550
- RANDY.

18:54.633 --> 18:55.384

18:55.467 --> 18:57.219
- THANKS, BUDDY.
APPRECIATE THAT.

18:57.302 --> 19:00.430
- THAT WAS AT RANDOM.
I SWEAR IT WAS.

19:00.514 --> 19:03.058
- KYLE?
- KING RUCK?

19:03.141 --> 19:05.102

- JIM.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.689
- AH.

[laughs] HOW YOU GONNA GIVE ME
THE GODDAMN THROAT?

19:14.153 --> 19:15.404
SERIOUSLY?

19:15.487 --> 19:16.738
- KEITH.
- HOW YOU DOIN'?

19:16.822 --> 19:17.739

- HEY, HOW'S IT GOIN', MAN?

19:17.823 --> 19:19.283

19:19.366 --> 19:21.743
- MELISSA.
- SAUSAGE.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.996
- ASHLEY.

19:24.079 --> 19:26.415
- I DON'T WANT TO COMPETE WITH
A BUNCH OF CRYBABIES.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.083
{\an8}ASHLEY'S GOT TO GO.
- REMEMBER, ARTISTS,

19:28.166 --> 19:29.251
{\an8}AFTER THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

19:29.334 --> 19:32.004
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
WILL VOTE ON THE TATTOO

19:32.087 --> 19:33.046
THAT THEY THINK
IS THE WORST

19:33.130 --> 19:35.799
AND PUT ONE ARTIST UP
FOR ELIMINATION.

19:35.883 --> 19:39.177
AND THE ARTIST WHO WINS
BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY

19:39.261 --> 19:41.513
WILL ALSO HAVE THE POWER TO PUT
ONE ARTIST UP FOR ELIMINATION.

19:41.597 --> 19:45.601
YOU'LL HAVE SIX HOURS
TO COMPLETE YOUR EYEBALL TATTOO.

19:45.684 --> 19:50.230
BASED ON YOUR WORK,
ONE OF YOU WILL BE CLOSING SHOP.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.649
GOOD LUCK.
- AN EYEBALL IS SOMETHING

19:52.733 --> 19:54.401
THAT EVERYBODY'S FAMILIAR
WITH SEEING.

19:54.484 --> 19:56.904
{\an8}WITHOUT THE RIGHT DIMENSION,
IT'S NOT GONNA LOOK LIFELIKE.

19:56.987 --> 19:57.988
{\an8}IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THE LINE

19:58.071 --> 19:59.823
{\an8}AND IF YOU DON'T HIT
THE RIGHT SHADES,

19:59.907 --> 20:01.658
{\an8}IT'S APPARENT.
- IS THERE ANY WAY

20:01.742 --> 20:04.119
{\an8}I CAN POSSIBLY TALK YOU
OUT OF GETTING IT

20:04.202 --> 20:05.787
{\an8}ON THE PALM OF YOUR HAND?

20:05.871 --> 20:08.165
{\an8}I CAN'T BELIEVE HALO GAVE ME
THE PALM CANVAS.

20:08.248 --> 20:10.459
I IMMEDIATELY
GO INTO PANIC MODE.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.879
I WOULD TATTOO YOUR ASS
OVER THAT HAND.

20:13.962 --> 20:15.255
- NO KIDDIN'?
- YEAH.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.506
[bleep] YOU, HALO.

20:16.590 --> 20:17.591
IT'S GONNA BE VIRTUALLY
IMPOSSIBLE, YOU KNOW?

20:17.674 --> 20:21.803
I DO PHOTOREALISM.
SO ANY OTHER PLACE?

20:21.887 --> 20:23.472
- NOT REALLY. NO.
- OTHER STUFF--OKAY.

20:23.555 --> 20:25.641
- YOU KNOW THE THROAT'S KIND OF
AN IFFY SPOT, RIGHT?

20:25.724 --> 20:29.353
HALO GAVE ME ONE OF THE WORST
PLACES POSSIBLE TO DO A TATTOO.

20:29.436 --> 20:30.437
{\an8}YOU HAVE TO STRETCH IT OUT

20:30.520 --> 20:31.146
{\an8}SO YOU CAN PUT THAT STENCIL
IN THERE,

20:31.230 --> 20:32.856
{\an8}AND THEN WHEN IT GOES BACK

20:32.940 --> 20:34.733
{\an8}IT'S ALL WARPED UP AND TWISTED.

20:34.816 --> 20:36.568
WERE YOU OPEN TO MAYBE MOVING IT
ANYWHERE ELSE?

20:36.652 --> 20:38.153
JUST FOR, LIKE...
- UM...

20:38.236 --> 20:39.905
- DIFFICULTY'S SAKE?
IF I CAN'T TALK THIS LADY OUT OF

20:39.988 --> 20:42.783
GETTIN' HER THROAT TATTOOED,
I COULD GO HOME.

20:44.743 --> 20:48.956
[rock music]

20:49.039 --> 20:50.707
- HI, ASHLEY.
- HELLO.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.000
- I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR THE FREAK-OUT I HAD.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.920
YESTERDAY I JUST LOST IT.

20:55.003 --> 20:55.921
I QUIT.

20:56.004 --> 20:57.130
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT
TO [bleep] HEAR?

20:57.214 --> 20:58.548
- NUT UP OR GET
THE [bleep] OUT.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.050
- OKAY, DICKHEAD.

21:00.133 --> 21:01.843
- YOU JUST SIT DOWN ON 'EM
AND GO, "YEAH, I [bleep] UP."

21:01.927 --> 21:03.178
- DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!

21:03.261 --> 21:05.847
I LET MY EMOTIONS
GET THE BEST OF ME

21:05.931 --> 21:07.265
IN THE LAST CHALLENGE.
- YUP.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.768
- AS EITHER ONE OF YOU WOULD OF
IF YOU FELT TARGETED.

21:09.851 --> 21:12.521
THAT'S HOW WE ARE, YOU KNOW?
MEN WILL BE LIKE,

21:12.604 --> 21:13.355
"I DID A [bleep] TATTOO,
BUT, YOU KNOW--"

21:13.438 --> 21:15.649
BUT INSIDE THEY'RE, LIKE, DYING.

21:15.732 --> 21:18.360
GIRLS WILL BE LIKE,
"OKAY, I DID A [bleep] TATTOO

21:18.443 --> 21:22.489
AND I'M GONNA CRY AND I'M GONNA
SHOW EVERYBODY MY WEAKNESS."

21:22.572 --> 21:24.157
- I FEEL LIKE ASHLEY'S

21:24.241 --> 21:25.993
GIVING FEMALE TATTOO ARTISTS
A BAD NAME.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.537
{\an8}I DON'T LIKE THAT SHE [bleep]
BLAMED CRYING ON BEING A GIRL.

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

21:30.205 --> 21:31.206

- I'M GONNA LOSE IT.

21:31.289 --> 21:31.999
{\an8}I--IT'S, LIKE, NOT CONTROLLABLE
FOR ME.

21:32.082 --> 21:34.710
{\an8}- ASHLEY'S MENTALLY WEAK.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.545
{\an8}MAN UP AND STOP BEIN'
A LITTLE BITCH.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.551
{\an8}- YOU HAVE FIVE HOURS TO CREATE
AN EYEBALL TATTOO

21:42.634 --> 21:46.013
{\an8}USING DIMENSION TO MAKE IT LOOK
JUST LIKE THE REAL THING,

21:46.096 --> 21:50.434
{\an8}AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

21:50.517 --> 21:51.727
{\an8}- LET'S DO THIS.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.562
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.
- YOU JUST TAKE A SEAT.

21:53.645 --> 21:54.896
{\an8}- WE'RE TESTING DIMENSION,

21:54.980 --> 21:57.065
{\an8}AND WHAT BETTER TO TEST IT
THAN A REALISTIC EYEBALL?

21:57.149 --> 21:59.401
AN EYE OBVIOUSLY IS NOT FLAT.

21:59.484 --> 22:01.570
AN EYE IS ROUND.
THEN YOU HAVE THE LIDS,

22:01.653 --> 22:04.531
YOU HAVE THE LASHES.
YOU HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT

22:04.614 --> 22:06.199
AREAS THAT YOU HAVE
TO SHOW DIMENSION.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.325
- THAT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF
COOL...

22:07.409 --> 22:10.662
- YEAH.
- WHEN YOU FLEX YOUR MUSCLE.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.205
{\an8}- FOR ME, THIS IS GOING
TO BE REDEMPTION,

22:12.289 --> 22:13.915
{\an8}BECAUSE THAT FLASH CHALLENGE,

22:13.999 --> 22:15.959
{\an8}MY HEAD JUST WASN'T WHERE
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE.

22:16.043 --> 22:16.710
- I SAW THAT YOU HAD
A REALLY DARK BROWN.

22:16.793 --> 22:18.754
- YUP.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.338
- ARE YOU GONNA GO
A LITTLE LIGHTER?

22:20.422 --> 22:22.257
REMEMBER, I HAD WANTED, LIKE,
A LITTLE BIT OF AN AUBURN COLOR.

22:22.340 --> 22:23.383
- RIGHT.
RIGHT, RIGHT.

22:23.467 --> 22:25.719
MY HUMAN CANVAS
IS A PAIN IN THE ASS.

22:25.802 --> 22:27.387
- THERE'S GONNA BE OTHER STUFF
AROUND IT, RIGHT, KIND OF?

22:27.471 --> 22:29.222
- DO YOU WANT OTHER STUFF
AROUND IT?

22:29.306 --> 22:30.432
- JUST LOOKS KIND OF PLAIN.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.476
- SHE'S STRESSING ME
THE [bleep] OUT.

22:32.559 --> 22:34.728
- LIKE, I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU,
YOU KNOW?

22:34.811 --> 22:38.190
BUT IT'S LIKE...

22:38.273 --> 22:40.108
- AWAY WE GO.
- ALL RIGHTY.

22:40.192 --> 22:45.238
[tattoo machines buzzing]

22:45.322 --> 22:48.200
- MY CANVAS WANTED
A PHOTOREALISTIC EYEBALL

22:48.283 --> 22:50.577
RIGHT ON HER THROAT.
- ANY SWELLING?

22:50.660 --> 22:51.369
- A LITTLE BIT.
NOT TOO MUCH.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.163
I'M BEIN' PRETTY GENTLE.

22:53.246 --> 22:54.539
{\an8}THAT WHOLE AREA IS JUST

22:54.623 --> 22:57.584
{\an8}ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT PLACES
TO DO A NICE, CLEAN TATTOO.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.086
{\an8}I DON'T REALLY WANT TO, LIKE,

22:59.169 --> 23:00.629
{\an8}HAVE YOU BLEEDIN' ALL OVER
THE PLACE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

23:00.712 --> 23:03.757
{\an8}I'M PRETTY PISSED AT HALO
FOR GIVIN' ME A THROAT,

23:03.840 --> 23:06.510
{\an8}SO I'M HOPIN' I JUST KNOCK
HIS ASS RIGHT OUT THE WATER.

23:06.593 --> 23:09.971
{\an8}- SO HOW'S IT LOOKIN'?
- CRAZY AWESOME.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.598
{\an8}- I NEED TO SHOW EVERYBODY

23:11.681 --> 23:14.101
{\an8}YET AGAIN THAT I DESERVE TO BE
ON THE TOP.

23:14.184 --> 23:16.186
YOU COULD HAVE GIVEN ME ANY ONE
OF THOSE TATTOOS UP THERE, DUDE.

23:16.269 --> 23:17.604
I PROMISE YOU I WOULD HAVE
BEEN FINE WITH IT.

23:17.687 --> 23:19.231
THAT'S NOT COCKY, THAT'S JUST

23:19.314 --> 23:21.024
I'VE DONE EVERYTHING ALREADY,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

23:21.108 --> 23:22.984
BASICALLY WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO
IS SHOW DIMENSION

23:23.068 --> 23:25.153
NOT JUST WITH THE EYE BUT
THE BACKGROUND AROUND THE EYE.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.238
I'M TRYING TO FRAME OUT,

23:26.321 --> 23:27.823
PUT A BUNCH OF LITTLE BLOCKS
IN THERE,

23:27.906 --> 23:29.908
A LITTLE TEARDROP, MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE IT'S COMING OFF THE SKIN

23:29.991 --> 23:34.121
TO SHOW DIMENSION, NOT ONE, NOT
TWO, BUT THREE DIFFERENT WAYS.

23:34.204 --> 23:35.413
I'M NOT GETTIN' [bleep]
TODAY.

23:35.497 --> 23:36.623
- [laughs]

23:36.706 --> 23:39.918
{\an8}- I GOT THE CANVAS WHO WANTS
HIS FATHER'S EYE.

23:40.001 --> 23:40.877
YOU ENJOYING YOUR TATTOO?

23:40.961 --> 23:41.878
- HAPPY SO FAR.
VERY HAPPY.

23:41.962 --> 23:43.296
- NICE.
I CAN'T MAKE THIS PRETTY.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.132
IT'S NOT A PRETTY EYE.

23:45.215 --> 23:46.341
HE'S AN OLD MAN.

23:46.424 --> 23:49.219
HE'S GOT BAGS, SKIN TAGS.
I'M SCREWED.

23:49.302 --> 23:51.138
{\an8}- ROLAND'S TATTOO
LOOKS LIKE A VAGINA

23:51.221 --> 23:52.556
{\an8}WITH AN EYE
COMIN' OUT OF IT.

23:52.639 --> 23:54.558
{\an8}I DON'T THINK HE HAS
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE HERE.

23:54.641 --> 23:55.851
{\an8}- AS LONG AS YOU'RE HAPPY,
I'M HAPPY.

23:55.934 --> 23:56.977
{\an8}- I'M HAPPY.

23:57.060 --> 23:58.353
{\an8}- THREE HOURS REMAIN.

23:58.436 --> 24:00.397
{\an8}[tattoo machine buzzing]

24:03.733 --> 24:05.819

ABOUT THIS TATTOO.

{\an8}I LOVE DOIN' GORY TATTOOS.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.196
IT'S RIGHT UP MY ALLEY.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.281
SHOULD BE HORRIFIC.

24:09.364 --> 24:11.867

OF ISSUES, SO AS LONG AS

24:11.950 --> 24:14.995
I CAN KEEP MY HEAD OUT OF MY ASS
I'M GONNA DO GREAT.

I CALLED MY WIFE LAST YEAR

24:16.997 --> 24:19.916

"I'M COMING HOME TOMORROW"?

STATEMENT IS, BUT IT'S NOT GOOD.

TATTOOED THIS ON YOUR BUTTHOLE

24:33.597 --> 24:35.724

ON YOUR PALM.

24:35.807 --> 24:36.933

TO DO A PALM TATTOO,
