WEBVTT

00:01.518 --> 00:04.681
All right,
I'm moving my infantry division...

00:04.854 --> 00:07.789
...augmented by a battalion of orcs
from Lord of the Rings.

00:07.957 --> 00:09.618
We flank the Tennessee volunteers...

00:09.793 --> 00:12.956
...and the North once again
wins the Battle of Gettysburg.

00:13.129 --> 00:16.189
Not so fast. Remember, the South
still has two infantry divisions.

00:16.366 --> 00:18.664
Plus Superman and Godzilla.

00:19.035 --> 00:20.696
No, no, no. Orcs are magic.

00:20.870 --> 00:22.360
Superman is vulnerable to magic.

00:22.539 --> 00:24.564
Not to mention,
you already lost Godzilla...

00:24.741 --> 00:27.039
...to the lllinois cavalry and Hulk.

00:27.477 --> 00:31.413
Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee
charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh?

00:31.581 --> 00:33.173
- You guys ready to order?
- Hang on.

00:33.349 --> 00:34.907
Shiva and Ganesh?

00:35.085 --> 00:37.576
The Hindu gods
against the entire Union Army?

00:37.754 --> 00:39.483
And orcs.

00:39.656 --> 00:41.123
I'll be back.

00:41.291 --> 00:44.818
Excuse me. Ganesh is the remover
of obstacles and Shiva's the destroyer.

00:44.994 --> 00:47.554
When the smoke clears,
Lincoln will be speaking Hindi...

00:47.731 --> 00:49.289
...and drinking mint juleps.

00:49.799 --> 00:53.200
My boss says you have to either
order or leave and never come back.

00:53.870 --> 00:56.771
What do you recommend for someone
with a man-sized appetite...

00:56.940 --> 00:59.374
...from a morning of
weight-training and cardio-funk?

00:59.542 --> 01:00.634
A shower.

01:01.511 --> 01:04.001
I'll take the heart-smart platter.

01:04.447 --> 01:06.278
All right, thank you. And Sheldon?

01:06.449 --> 01:08.679
We don't eat here.
I don't know what's good.

01:08.852 --> 01:11.377
- Well, it's all good.
- Statistically unlikely.

01:12.155 --> 01:14.248
Just get a hamburger.
You like hamburgers.

01:14.424 --> 01:16.449
I like the hamburgers
where we usually eat.

01:16.626 --> 01:19.652
You can't make the assumption
that I'll like the hamburgers here.

01:19.829 --> 01:22.423
I'm sorry. Give him a hamburger.

01:22.599 --> 01:24.499
Which one,
the classic, the ranch house...

01:24.667 --> 01:26.862
...the barbeque burger
or the Kobe burger?

01:27.036 --> 01:28.936
Can't we just go to Big Boy?

01:29.105 --> 01:33.735
- They only have one burger, the Big Boy.
- The barbeque burger's like the Big Boy.

01:33.910 --> 01:36.276
In a world that already
includes a Big Boy...

01:36.446 --> 01:38.778
...why would I settle for something
like a Big Boy?

01:38.948 --> 01:41.075
Because you are not at Big Boy.

01:42.085 --> 01:44.815
- Fine. I'll have the barbeque burger.
- Make it two.

01:44.988 --> 01:47.252
Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.

01:48.491 --> 01:49.856
Hey, Leonard. Hi, guys.

01:50.026 --> 01:51.186
- Hey.
- Hey, Leslie.

01:51.361 --> 01:55.058
- I didn't know you ate here.
- We don't. This is a disturbing aberration.

01:55.231 --> 01:58.428
Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across
the hall from Sheldon and me.

01:58.601 --> 02:01.365
And walks in quiet beauty
like the night.

02:01.971 --> 02:04.030
Howard, I've asked you not to do that.

02:05.074 --> 02:07.565
Leslie and I do research together
at the university.

02:07.777 --> 02:09.937
Oh, wow. A girl scientist.

02:10.113 --> 02:12.411
Yep. Come for the breasts,
stay for the brains.

02:13.383 --> 02:14.645
So I'm glad I ran into you.

02:14.818 --> 02:17.514
The Physics Department string quartet
needs a new cellist.

02:17.687 --> 02:19.086
What happened to Elliott Wong?

02:19.255 --> 02:22.122
Switched over to high-energy
radiation research, had a mishap.

02:22.292 --> 02:25.193
And now the other guys
are uncomfortable sitting next to him.

02:25.595 --> 02:27.495
- So are you in?
- Yeah, sure. Why not?

02:27.664 --> 02:31.065
- We rehearse on Tuesdays at your place.
- Why at my place?

02:31.234 --> 02:34.567
Yeah, Department of Energy said
our regular space is kind of a hot zone.

02:35.271 --> 02:37.330
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah, you too.

02:37.507 --> 02:39.737
Leonard, I didn't know
you played the cello.

02:39.909 --> 02:42.070
Yeah, my parents felt
that naming me Leonard...

02:42.245 --> 02:44.509
...and putting me
in advanced-placement classes...

02:44.681 --> 02:46.615
...wasn't getting me beaten up enough.

02:47.383 --> 02:49.544
If you're into music, I happen
to be a human beatbox...

02:49.719 --> 02:51.277
-... so...
- Really?

02:58.127 --> 03:00.186
I'm actually not that into music.

03:01.231 --> 03:04.098
Your friend's really cute.
Anything going on with you two?

03:04.634 --> 03:05.760
Leslie?

03:05.935 --> 03:08.199
No, no. What, are you kidding?

03:08.371 --> 03:11.363
He asked her out once.
It was an embarrassing failure.

03:11.741 --> 03:12.765
Thank you, Sheldon.

03:12.942 --> 03:15.103
I'm sorry.
Was that supposed to be a secret?

03:16.346 --> 03:19.076
That's too bad.
You guys would make a cute couple.

03:20.783 --> 03:22.546
- Oh, dear.
- What's the matter?

03:22.719 --> 03:23.879
She didn't take my order.

03:24.053 --> 03:27.284
How could she take your order
when you're too neurotic to talk to her?

03:28.057 --> 03:31.458
Nevertheless,
this will be reflected in her tip.

03:33.930 --> 03:36.922
What did Penny mean,
"you'd make a cute couple"?

03:37.100 --> 03:38.761
I assume she meant
the two of you...

03:38.935 --> 03:42.462
...would constitute a couple
that others might consider cute.

03:44.107 --> 03:48.806
An alternate and less likely interpretation
is that you could manufacture one.

03:49.913 --> 03:52.677
As in, "Look, Leonard and Leslie
made Mr. and Mrs. Goldfarb.

03:52.849 --> 03:54.646
Aren't they adorable? "

03:54.817 --> 03:57.377
If Penny didn't know
that Leslie had turned me down...

03:57.553 --> 04:01.751
...then that would mean that she, Penny,
thought I should ask her, Leslie, out...

04:01.925 --> 04:04.792
...indicating that Penny had no interest
in me asking her out.

04:04.961 --> 04:07.259
But because she did know
I had asked Leslie out...

04:07.430 --> 04:09.523
...and that she, Leslie,
had turned me down...

04:09.699 --> 04:13.100
...then she, Penny,
could be offering consolation.

04:14.504 --> 04:17.267
"That's too bad,
you would have made a cute couple. "

04:17.440 --> 04:21.877
But while thinking,
"Good, Leonard remains available. "

04:23.012 --> 04:25.378
You're a lucky man, Leonard.

04:26.649 --> 04:27.673
How so?

04:27.850 --> 04:30.080
You're talking to one of
the three men in the West...

04:30.253 --> 04:32.687
...capable of following
that train of thought.

04:33.790 --> 04:34.916
Well, what do you think?

04:35.091 --> 04:38.083
I said I could follow it,
I didn't say I cared.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:08.658 --> 05:11.218
I admire your fingering.

05:11.661 --> 05:13.356
Thank you.

05:14.197 --> 05:17.325
Maybe sometime you can
try that on my instrument.

05:26.142 --> 05:27.837
Good night, guys. Good job.
- Thanks.

05:28.011 --> 05:29.478
See you next week.

05:29.812 --> 05:32.508
- That was fun. Thanks for including me.
- You're welcome.

05:32.682 --> 05:35.879
If you're up for it, we could practice
that middle section again.

05:36.052 --> 05:37.952
Sure. Why not?

05:43.826 --> 05:47.227
Just so we're clear, you understand
me hanging back to practice with you...

05:47.397 --> 05:49.957
...is a pretext for letting you know
that I'm sexually available.

05:57.407 --> 05:58.704
Really?

05:58.875 --> 06:00.240
Yeah, I'm good to go.

06:00.910 --> 06:02.901
I thought you weren't interested in me.

06:03.079 --> 06:07.539
That was before I saw you handling that
beautiful piece of wood between your legs.

06:09.419 --> 06:10.943
You mean my cello.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.588
No, I mean the obvious,
crude double entendre.

06:13.756 --> 06:15.781
I'm seducing you.

06:16.993 --> 06:18.927
No kidding.

06:19.228 --> 06:22.595
What can I say?
I'm a passionate and impulsive woman.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.490
So how about it?

06:25.501 --> 06:27.196
Gee...

06:27.637 --> 06:31.095
- Is it the waitress?
- Penny? What about her?

06:31.274 --> 06:33.538
I saw your pupils dilate
when you looked at her...

06:33.709 --> 06:37.110
...which, unless you're a heroin addict,
points to sexual attraction.

06:38.514 --> 06:40.607
I did have a poppy-seed bagel
for breakfast...

06:40.783 --> 06:43.547
...which could give
a positive urine test for opiates...

06:43.719 --> 06:45.584
...but certainly not dilate my pupils...

06:45.755 --> 06:48.656
...so I guess there was no point
in bringing it up.

06:49.625 --> 06:52.560
- You and the waitress, then.
- No, no.

06:52.728 --> 06:55.424
There's nothing going on
between Penny and me.

06:55.631 --> 06:58.031
So you're open to a sexual relationship?

06:59.302 --> 07:01.167
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.

07:01.337 --> 07:02.929
- Good.
- Yeah, it is.

07:03.106 --> 07:04.767
It is good.

07:06.109 --> 07:08.043
Did you wanna start now?

07:08.211 --> 07:11.339
- Why don't we finish this section first?
- Oh, okay.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.641
A little musical foreplay. Terrific.

07:35.037 --> 07:36.664
- I'm- Good to go.
- Me too.

07:49.185 --> 07:50.584
Oh. Hey, Sheldon. What's going on?

07:51.020 --> 07:53.352
I need your opinion
on a matter of semiotics.

07:53.890 --> 07:57.087
- I'm sorry?
- Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols.

07:57.260 --> 08:00.388
It's a branch of philosophy
related to linguistics.

08:01.898 --> 08:05.390
Okay, sweetie, I know you think
you're explaining yourself...

08:05.568 --> 08:08.002
...but you're really not.

08:10.039 --> 08:11.370
Just come with me.

08:15.811 --> 08:17.039
Well?

08:17.213 --> 08:20.341
- Well, what?
- What does it mean?

08:20.683 --> 08:22.514
Come on, you went to college.

08:22.685 --> 08:24.983
Yes, but I was 11.

08:27.056 --> 08:30.548
A tie on the doorknob usually means
someone doesn't wanna be disturbed...

08:30.726 --> 08:35.059
...because they're, you know,
getting busy.

08:36.065 --> 08:38.124
So you're saying
Leonard has a girl in there?

08:38.301 --> 08:43.102
Well, either that or he's lost his tie rack
and gotten really into Bryan Adams.

08:44.140 --> 08:46.199
LESLIE
Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.

08:49.712 --> 08:52.306
We really shouldn't be standing here.

08:54.317 --> 08:56.251
This is very awkward.

08:56.485 --> 08:59.750
Oh, come on. You know,
Leonard's had girls over before, right?

08:59.922 --> 09:04.154
Oh, yes. But there's usually planning,
courtship, advance notice.

09:04.727 --> 09:09.562
You know, last time, I was able to book
a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.

09:10.466 --> 09:13.958
Wait, wait. You had to leave the state
because your roommate was having sex?

09:14.136 --> 09:17.162
I didn't have to.
The dates just happened to coincide.

09:20.009 --> 09:22.068
So do you know who's in there?

09:23.045 --> 09:25.138
Well, there's Leonard.

09:28.217 --> 09:32.654
And he's either with Leslie Winkle
or a 1930s gangster.

09:34.724 --> 09:37.659
Hmm. Good for him.

09:37.994 --> 09:40.292
Good for Leonard.

09:41.364 --> 09:42.490
Okay. Night.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.292
No, don't. Wait, hold on.

09:44.467 --> 09:47.800
- What's the matter?
- I don't know what the protocol is here.

09:49.705 --> 09:51.730
Do I stay? Do I leave?

09:51.907 --> 09:54.603
Do I wait to greet them
with a refreshing beverage?

09:56.679 --> 09:58.647
Gee, Sheldon,
you're asking the wrong girl.

09:58.814 --> 10:00.941
I'm usually on the other side
of the tie.

10:21.837 --> 10:23.634
Hi, Leonard?

10:26.509 --> 10:28.067
It's me.

10:28.244 --> 10:29.905
Sheldon.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.776
In the living room.

10:32.948 --> 10:35.348
I just-
I wanted you to know I saw the tie.

10:35.518 --> 10:38.146
Message received.

10:40.856 --> 10:42.881
You're welcome.

10:43.859 --> 10:47.522
You carry on. Give my best to Leslie.

11:24.867 --> 11:26.528
Big Boy.

11:51.227 --> 11:53.661
Someone touched my board.

11:56.699 --> 11:58.724
Oh, God, my board.

12:00.669 --> 12:02.330
Leonard.

12:02.505 --> 12:04.370
Leonard!

12:04.540 --> 12:06.235
Hey, what's the matter?

12:06.409 --> 12:08.604
Equations.
Someone's tampered with my equations.

12:08.778 --> 12:10.040
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

12:10.212 --> 12:12.612
Look at the beta function
of quantum chromodynamics.

12:12.782 --> 12:14.841
The sign's been changed.

12:15.017 --> 12:16.348
Oh, yeah.

12:16.519 --> 12:18.919
But doesn't that fix the problem
you've been having?

12:19.088 --> 12:21.352
Are you insane?
Are you out of your mind?

12:21.524 --> 12:24.925
Are you-? Hey, look, that fixes
the problem I've been having.

12:26.061 --> 12:27.926
You're welcome.

12:29.031 --> 12:31.192
You did this?

12:31.367 --> 12:34.393
Yeah. I noticed it when I got up
to get water, so I fixed it.

12:34.570 --> 12:37.630
Now you can show quarks are
asymptotically free at high energies.

12:37.807 --> 12:39.274
Pretty cool, huh?

12:41.010 --> 12:42.705
"Cool"?

12:43.279 --> 12:44.746
Listen, I gotta get to the lab.

12:44.914 --> 12:46.882
Thanks for a great night.

12:47.950 --> 12:49.508
Thank you. I'll see you at work.

12:50.453 --> 12:53.149
- Hold on. Hold on.
- What?

12:53.322 --> 12:56.257
- Who told you you could touch my board?
- No one.

12:56.425 --> 12:58.950
I don't come into your house
and touch your board.

12:59.128 --> 13:01.460
There are no incorrect equations
on my board.

13:04.667 --> 13:08.296
Oh, that is so, so...

13:09.772 --> 13:13.640
I'm sorry, I gotta run. If you
come up with an adjective, text me.

13:17.279 --> 13:20.908
Inconsiderate. That is the adjective.
Inconsiderate.

13:22.585 --> 13:25.645
You can stare at your board all day,
she's still going to be right.

13:25.821 --> 13:27.413
I'm not staring, I'm mulling.

13:27.590 --> 13:29.353
- Oh, hey, Leonard.
- Hi.

13:29.925 --> 13:33.952
So how's it going?

13:36.198 --> 13:38.325
Pretty good.

13:38.701 --> 13:42.569
Just pretty good? I'd think
you were doing very good.

13:43.772 --> 13:47.708
"Pretty, very. " There's really no objective
scale for delineating variations of good.

13:47.877 --> 13:50.004
Why do you ask?

13:50.179 --> 13:54.013
Well, a little bird told me that
you and Leslie hooked up last night.

13:55.851 --> 13:58.684
- Sheldon!
I'm coming.

13:58.854 --> 14:01.414
So is it serious? Do you like her?

14:01.824 --> 14:03.519
I don't...

14:04.093 --> 14:08.553
That's really two different questions.
I'm not-

14:08.731 --> 14:10.494
Sheldon, we have to go.

14:10.666 --> 14:15.000
Boy, you're wound awfully tight
for a man who just had sexual intercourse.

14:16.405 --> 14:20.432
All right, well, I'll talk to you later.
But I am so happy for you, Leonard.

14:21.610 --> 14:23.339
Thank you.

14:25.881 --> 14:28.816
What did she mean, she's happy for me?

14:28.984 --> 14:32.613
Is she happy because I'm seeing someone
or because she thinks I'm happy?

14:32.788 --> 14:35.848
Because anyone who cared for someone
would want them to be happy...

14:36.025 --> 14:39.654
...even if the reason for their happiness
made the first person unhappy.

14:39.828 --> 14:42.228
You know, because the second person,
though happy...

14:42.398 --> 14:45.765
...is now romantically unavailable
to the first person.

14:45.935 --> 14:50.429
Do you realize I may have to share
a Nobel Prize with your booty call?

14:53.442 --> 14:55.137
You know what?

14:55.311 --> 14:56.903
I'm being ridiculous.

14:57.746 --> 14:59.441
But who cares what Penny thinks?

14:59.615 --> 15:02.778
Leslie is a terrific girl.
She's attractive. We like each other.

15:02.952 --> 15:04.510
She's extremely intelligent.

15:04.687 --> 15:07.588
She's not that intelligent.
She fixed your equation.

15:07.756 --> 15:10.054
She got lucky.
You don't believe in luck.

15:10.225 --> 15:12.716
I don't have to believe in it
for her to be lucky.

15:13.295 --> 15:16.196
Regardless, I have a chance
at a real relationship with Leslie.

15:16.365 --> 15:19.528
I'm not gonna pass that up for
some hypothetical future happiness...

15:19.702 --> 15:22.728
...with a woman who may
or may not want me to be happy...

15:22.905 --> 15:26.306
...with the woman
who is currently making me happy.

15:27.042 --> 15:28.236
Leonard.
Yeah?

15:28.410 --> 15:30.605
I still don't care.

15:38.721 --> 15:40.086
Hey, Leslie.

15:40.255 --> 15:43.691
Careful, Leonard. Liquid nitrogen,
320 degrees below zero.

15:44.760 --> 15:46.819
Brrrr. Heh.

15:52.334 --> 15:54.859
Why are you smashing
a flash-frozen banana?

15:55.037 --> 15:58.097
Because I got a bowl of Cheerios
and I couldn't find a knife.

16:00.109 --> 16:04.307
So anyway, hello.

16:06.615 --> 16:08.082
What are you doing?

16:08.250 --> 16:10.514
Just extending the intimacy.

16:10.686 --> 16:13.018
Hey, do you wanna slip over
to the radiation lab...

16:13.188 --> 16:16.021
...and share a decontamination shower?

16:18.861 --> 16:23.161
Okay, what exactly do you think's
going on between us?

16:23.966 --> 16:28.266
I'm not sure, but I think I'm about
to discover how the banana felt.

16:32.007 --> 16:36.410
Neither of us are neuroscientists, but we
both understand the biochemistry of sex.

16:36.578 --> 16:40.014
Dopamine in our brains is released
across synapses, causing pleasure.

16:40.182 --> 16:42.980
Stick electrodes in a rat's brain,
give him an orgasm button.

16:43.152 --> 16:45.848
He'll push that thing
until he starves to death.

16:46.021 --> 16:47.886
Well, who wouldn't? Heh.

16:48.057 --> 16:49.922
The difference between us and the rat...

16:50.092 --> 16:52.617
...is you can't stick an electrode
in our hypothalamus.

16:52.795 --> 16:54.285
That's where you come in.

16:56.298 --> 16:59.324
Yeah, well,
I'm just glad to be a part of it. Heh.

17:00.469 --> 17:01.697
So, what happens now?

17:01.870 --> 17:05.601
Well, I don't know about your sex drive,
but I'm probably good till New Year's.

17:07.409 --> 17:08.671
Oh.

17:08.844 --> 17:10.435
Okay.

17:10.979 --> 17:13.277
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

17:16.117 --> 17:19.246
- You wanna make plans for New Year's?
- Please, you're smothering me.

17:19.421 --> 17:21.286
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:22.124 --> 17:24.887
Hey, look. It's Dr. Stud.

17:26.127 --> 17:27.152
Doctor what?

17:27.329 --> 17:30.025
The blogosphere is abuzzing
with news of you and Leslie...

17:30.199 --> 17:33.293
...making the bang, bang music.

17:33.836 --> 17:37.704
- Well, how did it get on the Internet?
- I put it there.

17:38.107 --> 17:39.904
Well, how did you know about it?

17:40.075 --> 17:41.736
A little bird told us.

17:42.778 --> 17:45.679
Apparently, you are a magnificent beast.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.675
Well, that part's true.

17:55.324 --> 17:57.485
I think I may have
misjudged this restaurant.

17:57.659 --> 17:59.786
- No kidding.
- I don't wanna go out on a limb...

17:59.962 --> 18:03.159
...but I think we may be looking
at my new Tuesday hamburger.

18:04.266 --> 18:07.633
Your old Tuesday hamburger
will be so brokenhearted.

18:08.470 --> 18:09.494
Way ahead of you.

18:09.671 --> 18:14.199
I was thinking of moving Big Boy to
Thursdays and just dropping Souplantation.

18:14.977 --> 18:16.205
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:16.378 --> 18:19.643
The name always confused me, anyway.
Souplantation.

18:19.815 --> 18:21.612
You can't grow soup.

18:24.553 --> 18:27.545
- So how's everything?
- Terrific.

18:28.023 --> 18:31.720
You'll be happy to know I plan to come
every Tuesday for the foreseeable future.

18:31.894 --> 18:34.795
Really? Oh, yay. Heh.

18:35.597 --> 18:38.464
Who do I speak to about
permanently reserving this table?

18:39.234 --> 18:41.964
I don't know, a psychiatrist?

18:43.372 --> 18:44.805
So, hey.

18:45.274 --> 18:48.368
- How are things with you and Leslie?
- Oh.

18:48.544 --> 18:51.240
To be honest,
I don't think it's going to work out.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.278
Oh, that's too bad.
Well, hey, don't worry.

18:55.450 --> 18:58.908
I'm sure there's someone out there
who's just right for you.

19:01.990 --> 19:04.424
Well, what did she mean by that?

19:04.793 --> 19:08.991
Was that just a generic platitude
or was that a subtle bid for attention?

19:10.999 --> 19:14.435
You know why this hamburger
surpasses the Big Boy?

19:14.770 --> 19:17.762
This is a single-decker,
whereas the Big Boy is a double-decker.

19:17.940 --> 19:22.036
This has a much more satisfying
meat-to-bun-to-condiment ratio.

19:22.778 --> 19:25.338
- Are you even listening to me?
- Of course I'm listening.

19:25.514 --> 19:29.177
Blah, blah, hopeless Penny delusion,
blah, blah, blah.

19:31.019 --> 19:32.816
Okay, then.

19:34.423 --> 19:37.517
You know, you can grow
the ingredients for soup.
