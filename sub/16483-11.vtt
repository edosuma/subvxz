00:01.502 --> 00:03.921
<i>Previously on</i> Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.046 --> 00:05.214
S.H.I.E.L.D. still needs a face.

00:05.339 --> 00:08.759
Keep the title, but when it comes
to operations, I'm calling the shots.

00:10.553 --> 00:11.929
<i>We were so close.</i>

00:12.096 --> 00:14.557
<i>Your previous model had
the Darkhold book in her hand.</i>

00:14.724 --> 00:17.685
And all the answers it holds.
Oh, poor Fitz.

00:17.810 --> 00:20.688
We could just reboot the head
in a controlled environment,

00:20.771 --> 00:22.231
and then we could
diagnose the problem together.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.650
Please! Drop it.

00:24.775 --> 00:28.154
- I'm gonna figure out what broke you.
<i>- Thank you, Fitz.</i>

00:28.362 --> 00:30.865
Will there be another opportunity
to acquire the Darkhold?

00:30.948 --> 00:33.034
Agent May's decoy will be more convincing.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.369
Her programming operates
on a subconscious level.

00:35.578 --> 00:37.830
If Agent May isn't aware of her mission
to retrieve the Darkhold,

00:37.997 --> 00:39.707
then she won't be able to reveal herself.

00:40.041 --> 00:43.127
<i>She'll instinctively climb the ranks,
gain access,</i>

00:43.210 --> 00:47.840
and get closer to Agent Coulson,
the man who knows just where this book is.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.353
<i>Sorry.</i>

01:01.437 --> 01:03.689
<i>Didn't think you'd get stuck on a milk run
to Radcliffe's.</i>

01:03.773 --> 01:07.068
- We're gonna miss you in the field.
- I'll catch up.

01:07.359 --> 01:09.153
Can't let you have all the fun.

01:10.071 --> 01:13.532
When this is over, it's time.
We are cracking that bottle.

01:14.450 --> 01:18.120
- You don't have to twist my arm.
- I wouldn't dare. You might whip my ass.

01:25.169 --> 01:26.212
Agent May.

01:27.797 --> 01:31.300
Director Mace... he... he knows
that Aida is...

01:32.343 --> 01:34.512
- what Aida is?
- Yeah. He knows.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.263
I wish I'd been there to explain.

01:36.847 --> 01:39.141
Ho... how did he take it?

01:39.225 --> 01:41.352
He wants to use her on this but concerned.

01:41.477 --> 01:43.979
"Concerned." That's not a happy word.

01:44.146 --> 01:46.816
- Did... Did he say...
- He wants to talk, has questions.

01:46.941 --> 01:48.776
I don't like those words, either.

01:49.652 --> 01:52.530
I hear you're on your way to personally
escort Aida. Why?

01:52.696 --> 01:55.658
Well, no one knows what she can do.
And she saw the Darkhold.

01:55.741 --> 01:57.701
Well, I could help with that.
Once I've studied it,

01:57.868 --> 02:01.413
- I'd be able to determine...
- No. No. No one's touching it.

02:02.248 --> 02:05.167
When this is over,
I'm destroying the book myself.

02:06.544 --> 02:09.338
Because it's dangerous, yeah.
I... I... I understand.

02:10.256 --> 02:12.299
You still need access to my apartment.
Maybe I could, uh...

02:12.383 --> 02:14.301
No, that's never been a problem
for me.

02:14.385 --> 02:15.678
Right, right, right.

02:15.761 --> 02:18.347
Well, I'll reach out to Aida, anyway,
tell her to expect you.

02:18.973 --> 02:22.476
Be ready to help solve
the current problem.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.355
- Sure.
- Okay.

02:38.534 --> 02:42.121
Aida, I want you to access
your information cache.

02:43.122 --> 02:45.291
Locate the Sunset Protocol.

02:46.542 --> 02:48.043
I have it, Doctor.

02:50.379 --> 02:51.755
Activate it.

02:55.968 --> 02:59.054
Hello, Agent May.
I've been expecting you.

03:01.557 --> 03:04.810
Dr Radcliffe gave me
specific instructions. Happy to help.

03:08.063 --> 03:10.482
Allow me to retrieve
the neural-assessment gauge.

03:11.317 --> 03:13.444
What's a neural-assessment gauge?

03:14.695 --> 03:15.738
Oh.

03:32.129 --> 03:34.965
I apologise, Agent May.

03:58.239 --> 04:00.449
Let's get you up to speed, shall we?

04:19.385 --> 04:21.887
- What's a neural-assessment gauge?
- Right this way.

04:45.369 --> 04:49.206
Hope you liked your facial, Melinda.
It's time for your massage. Ready?

04:49.498 --> 04:51.041
I don't remember coming here.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.544
You dozed off.
Obviously, you're very relaxed.

04:53.877 --> 04:55.087
That's good.

04:56.422 --> 04:59.341
Yeah, I don't think I have time for this.
Thanks.

05:16.942 --> 05:19.778
Hope you liked your massage, Melinda.
It's time for your facial.

05:20.112 --> 05:23.032
Look, I... I don't think I want this.

05:23.699 --> 05:24.950
I don't want to be here.

05:34.793 --> 05:37.171
- Hope you liked your facial, Melinda.
- No.

05:59.068 --> 06:02.154
- Aida, no!
- I knew it wasn't real.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.952
Oh. The syringe, Aida.
You have to sedate her.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.665
You bastard.

06:21.340 --> 06:22.841
We may have misjudged
what it takes

06:23.008 --> 06:24.718
to keep Agent May comfortable.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.515
<i>Heart rate normal,
vitals stable.</i>

06:30.224 --> 06:32.851
- Seems to be working.
- You found the solution, Doctor.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.812
Mm. Well, for now, yes.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.272
But it's not a permanent fix.

06:37.689 --> 06:40.734
However, as long as our May replacement
at the S.H.I.E.L.D. base does her job,

06:40.859 --> 06:43.278
- it doesn't have to be.
- Question.

06:44.029 --> 06:46.990
Why does it matter if the original May
is dead or alive?

06:49.118 --> 06:51.286
- Aida?
- It doesn't make logical sense.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.873
We have cerebral replication.
We have physical replication.

06:55.374 --> 06:57.292
No one in S.H.I.E.L.D.
knows she's been replaced.

06:57.501 --> 06:59.211
What empirical difference is there?

06:59.378 --> 07:01.755
Well, for one thing,
the Framework is in beta testing.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.174
- We need May alive for calibration...
- Yes, but I...

07:04.299 --> 07:05.884
But also, we're not killers.

07:06.593 --> 07:09.263
Nathanson was a drastic over-adjustment.

07:09.513 --> 07:12.683
But isn't it preferable to sacrifice
one life to save millions?

07:13.100 --> 07:15.727
Yes, as a last resort, Aida.

07:16.061 --> 07:19.273
But I hope that May won't give us
any kind of problem at all,

07:19.398 --> 07:21.900
and we don't have to face sacrificing her.

07:22.818 --> 07:28.490
Our May Life-Model Decoy
should get us the Darkhold eventually.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.409
And if something goes wrong...

07:32.035 --> 07:33.579
then we have our safety net.

07:34.538 --> 07:36.206
You're referring to the other android...

07:37.416 --> 07:39.042
- now in operation.
- Yes.

07:40.002 --> 07:41.712
Our second LMD.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.276
We have to show the world
who she really is.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.904
And it's well past time.
Daisy now represents S.H.I.E.L.D.

08:07.029 --> 08:09.656
- Everything has to be above-board.
- But marching into the Capitol Building

08:09.740 --> 08:12.910
so Daisy can sign the Sokovia Accords?
Senator Nadeer will be there.

08:13.035 --> 08:15.370
- It seems risky.
- We're all aware of the dangers,

08:15.496 --> 08:17.456
- some of us more than others.
- I'm fine with it, Jemma.

08:17.623 --> 08:20.918
Are you? It doesn't seem like you.
And, Coulson, you're letting her.

08:21.043 --> 08:23.253
That... It doesn't seem like you, either.

08:25.255 --> 08:28.217
With Nadeer and her staff in the meeting,
we have an opportunity.

08:28.383 --> 08:31.470
What opportunity?
I wasn't briefed on any opportunity.

08:32.221 --> 08:33.554
While Nadeer's in with Daisy,

08:33.889 --> 08:35.974
Yo-Yo and I will get into her office
and plant surveillance.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.559
We can finally keep an eye on her,
figure out her next move.

08:38.644 --> 08:40.687
What? No. No.

08:41.104 --> 08:44.691
No, there'll be no planting, no eyeing,
no Yo-Yo-ing.

08:44.942 --> 08:48.487
S.H.I.E.L.D. is now legitimate.
We have to remain above reproach.

08:48.612 --> 08:51.490
You mean like juicing our Director
so he can pretend to be Inhuman?

08:51.698 --> 08:54.201
Look, you are reacting to the situation
we had.

08:54.326 --> 08:57.120
You put Jeffrey in place, I understand,
but we're S.H.I.E.L.D.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.873
- We have to be proactive.
- This is politics, Phil,

09:00.123 --> 09:01.416
which means politicians.

09:01.833 --> 09:05.462
They are a festering cesspool
of toxic-waste fires.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.340
You swim in those waters,
you could get pulled under.

09:08.632 --> 09:11.218
You and the Director can handle it.
We'll handle the rest.

09:11.510 --> 09:12.553
May, you with us?

09:15.138 --> 09:16.139
Always.

09:22.521 --> 09:23.981
Hmm. She's stabilised now.

09:25.857 --> 09:28.944
As I said, no reason to even consider
harming Agent May.

09:29.861 --> 09:31.029
Very good, Doctor.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.333
Oh, dear. Not again.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.004
I'm happy Turtleman came out

10:29.087 --> 10:30.297
to play this morning.

10:32.758 --> 10:34.301
You. You're Turtleman.

10:34.384 --> 10:37.471
- It's not a nickname for your...
- Okay, I get it. I get it.

10:37.638 --> 10:40.140
- We could find a nickname for it but...
- No, I'm good.

10:40.265 --> 10:42.225
Okay. Me too.

10:45.062 --> 10:46.396
I enjoy you.

10:47.397 --> 10:48.732
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

10:49.816 --> 10:54.237
I mean, sure, you're an engineer,
and you're smart, and...

10:55.113 --> 10:56.490
your insides are great...

10:57.532 --> 11:00.160
but this outside, these arms...

11:01.203 --> 11:03.163
- they don't even seem real.
- Oh.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.624
You're not so bad yourself.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.042
- "Not bad"?
- Hmm.

11:10.128 --> 11:11.588
I'm a knockout.

11:12.214 --> 11:13.173
And I'm thirsty.

11:14.966 --> 11:17.260
- Want some water?
- No, I'm good.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.282
Oh, is it time for the mission already?

11:40.992 --> 11:43.829
Uh, no, it's a change of plans. I...

11:44.830 --> 11:46.456
I'm not gonna be on this one.

11:47.165 --> 11:49.084
I was just covering
the communications here, anyway.

11:49.167 --> 11:51.545
I, uh... I got to do something else.

11:53.130 --> 11:55.173
Is that the text you just got?

11:55.549 --> 11:57.676
Yeah. It's just a change of plans.

11:58.427 --> 11:59.845
It's, uh...

12:05.559 --> 12:06.727
Look. I'm sorry.

12:07.310 --> 12:10.605
I know it's bad timing,
but you guys are gonna be fine.

12:10.981 --> 12:12.107
Okay?

12:12.190 --> 12:14.067
I'll catch up with you
when you get back.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.528
- Okay.
- Okay?

12:31.585 --> 12:34.296
- Fitz.
- Hey.

12:35.464 --> 12:38.216
- You need something?
- Answers about Aida.

12:38.675 --> 12:41.094
Security report on the incident,
need to close it out.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.764
Okay. What do you need to know?

12:44.347 --> 12:47.809
How much was Aida aware of what she was
going to do before she did it?

12:48.477 --> 12:49.770
Could she have stopped it?

12:50.604 --> 12:53.148
This isn't about a security report, is it?

12:54.608 --> 12:55.859
It's about you.

12:58.236 --> 13:01.031
About ordering Aida to read the Darkhold.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.408
Trust me, I was trying to get her to do
the same thing,

13:03.533 --> 13:05.202
and I'm asking
the same questions that you are.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.245
I think you did what you had to do
in the moment.

13:07.913 --> 13:09.122
It was a hard choice.

13:09.414 --> 13:11.374
Not when it comes to saving you
and Coulson.

13:11.833 --> 13:12.709
No.

13:14.753 --> 13:15.962
That's just how you're built.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.704
Aida?

13:51.164 --> 13:52.457
I need to go out for a bit.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.209
There's a situation
to which I must attend.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.710
Shall I drive you?

13:56.002 --> 13:57.337
No. Shouldn't take long.

13:57.629 --> 14:00.298
Doctor, if Agent May does become
a problem...

14:00.423 --> 14:02.300
Oh, I don't see that happening.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.686
Gentlemen, Agent Mackenzie requested
personal time,

14:12.769 --> 14:15.730
- so he's not with us on this.
- Mack or no Mack, I'm urging you

14:15.856 --> 14:17.566
to reconsider the second part
of this mission.

14:17.649 --> 14:19.943
- Which part is the second part again?
- The stupid part.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.570
Ah. Nadeer's office.

14:21.653 --> 14:24.573
If she discovers you've launched
an unauthorised investigation into her,

14:24.698 --> 14:28.285
it's gonna trigger an investigation
into you. There are always consequences.

14:28.410 --> 14:30.704
It's dangerous, but she's dangerous.

14:30.871 --> 14:33.331
And this is our chance to get ahead
of it proactively.

14:33.456 --> 14:36.042
- Gentlemen, I'm sure we...
- Keep calling me reactive, Phil.

14:36.126 --> 14:37.335
Half the time, I'm reacting

14:37.460 --> 14:39.462
to the steaming pile
of fart pebbles you hand me.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.506
And the other half,
you're not giving me the full story.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.884
- We're like the <i>Odd Couple</i> here.
- Gentlemen, we have a mission.

14:44.009 --> 14:45.635
At the very least,
we need a contingency plan.

14:45.719 --> 14:46.803
If she comes after you,

14:46.887 --> 14:49.222
she's gonna want S.H.I.E.L.D. records,
S.H.I.E.L.D. assets.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.600
Let me take them to a military facility
for protection.

14:51.683 --> 14:54.436
That makes no sense. Our people
are trained to protect those assets.

14:54.519 --> 14:58.398
- Until she deposes all of you.
- General, the assets belong here.

14:58.648 --> 15:02.193
And for the record, Nadeer tried to kill
several people, including me.

15:02.319 --> 15:04.738
Coulson is right.
We need to get ahead of her.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.491
Yeah, but you have to say that, don't you?

15:10.118 --> 15:11.286
Excuse me.

15:42.317 --> 15:44.736
Perhaps you are going to be a problem
after all.

16:10.679 --> 16:12.097
I like you, Agent May.

16:12.681 --> 16:14.975
I don't wish for you to suffer.

16:15.100 --> 16:18.144
I promise to make this quick and painless.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.772
Thanks. I'm not worried.

16:53.805 --> 16:55.015
How're you holding up?

16:56.224 --> 16:57.976
- It's okay to be nervous, you know.
- Me?

16:58.309 --> 17:00.145
Nah, I don't get nervous anymore.

17:00.729 --> 17:01.896
Okay.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.898
Well, I'm just saying, if you are...

17:05.066 --> 17:07.569
I mean, it's not my comfort zone,
but I'm good.

17:08.278 --> 17:10.488
I'll just tell the truth.
I'm good at that.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.157
You?

17:19.664 --> 17:21.915
You don't talk much about your childhood,
do you?

17:23.042 --> 17:25.211
The foster homes, bouncing around.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.048
I imagine, a lot of the time,
it felt like you had to perform

17:28.173 --> 17:29.883
to convince people to like you.

17:31.926 --> 17:33.803
Only the places I wanted to stay.

17:34.137 --> 17:36.806
- Why are you asking?
- Because if you enter every room...

17:37.891 --> 17:39.893
thinking you got to do a song and dance,

17:40.310 --> 17:42.604
eventually everything becomes
a performance.

17:43.146 --> 17:47.317
And believe me, I know how it feels
putting on an act full-time.

17:50.695 --> 17:51.863
Yeah.

17:52.864 --> 17:53.990
You do, don't you?

17:54.949 --> 17:57.827
Anyway, I know it's not an act with you.

17:58.912 --> 18:01.748
Coulson's been saying since day one
that you're the real deal,

18:01.873 --> 18:04.751
and I've learned to trust his read
on people...

18:06.044 --> 18:07.087
so...

18:11.341 --> 18:13.676
He believed in me before I believed
in myself.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.932
You too, you know.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.601
It's why he wants you with us still. He...

18:21.768 --> 18:24.437
He keeps saying you were trying to do
the right thing.

18:24.813 --> 18:26.523
Oh, you've talked about it, huh?

18:27.232 --> 18:28.399
Sure.

18:33.530 --> 18:35.907
And listen, with me...

18:37.826 --> 18:38.952
sometimes it's...

18:42.205 --> 18:43.915
Sometimes I think it's an act.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.337
You got this.

18:53.550 --> 18:56.719
- Jeffrey, I'm surprised to see you.
- Yeah, I'm sure you are.

18:57.095 --> 18:58.763
Surprised to see him not dead, you mean?

18:58.847 --> 19:02.475
There'll be plenty of time to ask
questions after we've started, Ellen.

19:02.767 --> 19:05.395
I expect a lot of questions will be
answered in this meeting.

19:05.937 --> 19:07.021
Have fun.

19:10.608 --> 19:14.070
- Great. What does that even mean?
- I think we're gonna find out.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.200
All right,
let's bring the meeting to order.

19:19.284 --> 19:21.536
Agent Daisy Johnson,
we'd like to swear you in.

19:26.249 --> 19:28.084
You're clear, sir. Go ahead.

19:28.293 --> 19:29.460
Thank you.

19:35.049 --> 19:37.510
- That went well.
- Fitz is an artist.

19:38.928 --> 19:41.681
- So, Mack, personal time, huh?
- Don't put me in the middle of this.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.100
What middle? No middle.
But you know something.

19:44.225 --> 19:47.270
It's not for me to say.
Mack's a very private person.

19:47.645 --> 19:50.023
All I know about him
is what's in his file.

19:50.565 --> 19:52.066
I spent six months on a plane
with the guy.

19:52.150 --> 19:55.486
- I bet I know less than you.
- So, maybe something's on his file.

19:55.570 --> 19:58.656
Maybe you should ask him.

19:58.740 --> 20:02.035
Well, I don't know about annoying him,
but you're starting to annoy me.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.245
Isn't it better to learn things
organically

20:04.370 --> 20:07.707
- instead of all at once in a report?
- No, all at once. Much better.

20:07.957 --> 20:12.295
Private person, secret, same thing.
Must be even tougher with May.

20:14.339 --> 20:17.592
If it's better to get to know each other
in tiny, slow, annoying pieces...

20:17.675 --> 20:20.386
- I don't think that's how I put it.
- ...then you two will never get together.

20:20.511 --> 20:23.139
Me and May?
No. It's not like that.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.851
Please. I don't need to read
a file on you two to know.

20:29.437 --> 20:31.648
You know, no one likes a smart-ass.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.400
That hasn't been my experience.

20:44.702 --> 20:47.622
- You and May ready for the op?
- Yeah, we've got it covered.

20:49.707 --> 20:52.001
Uh. We could always use
a fresh pair of eyes

20:52.085 --> 20:54.295
- if you'd like to join us.
- Yeah, no. I've...

20:55.004 --> 20:57.257
- stuff to do here.
- Okay.

21:01.344 --> 21:04.264
You know, one of the upsides of having
a girlfriend is you get to...

21:04.764 --> 21:06.474
talk about what's bothering you.

21:06.557 --> 21:09.936
Yeah, well, doesn't really sound like
an upside for the girlfriend.

21:10.895 --> 21:14.107
I know you're upset about Aida.
I'm in a strange position.

21:14.649 --> 21:18.236
I don't want to intrude on you
while you're... processing.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.614
But I also want you to know
you can talk to me.

21:22.699 --> 21:23.741
Always.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.619
Yeah, I know.

21:27.161 --> 21:28.246
Just, uh...

21:29.330 --> 21:31.958
You know I go all quiet
when I'm processing.

21:33.584 --> 21:34.502
Okay.

21:52.186 --> 21:53.938
No, Senator, I understand.

21:54.063 --> 21:56.524
Being a party to the Sokovia Accords
would be

21:56.774 --> 21:59.152
very different from being
an undercover S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.904
Well, you'll answer to a different
authority... the public.

22:02.113 --> 22:04.032
Believe me, I've... I've had worse bosses.

22:06.367 --> 22:10.204
- Uh. Next up is Senator Nadeer.
- Thank you, Mr Chairperson.

22:10.621 --> 22:13.666
Agent Johnson, as an Inhuman yourself,
do you feel more responsibility

22:13.791 --> 22:18.212
- to help Inhumans than normal Americans?
- Well, first of all, Inhumans are normal.

22:18.463 --> 22:20.089
Let's be clear about that.

22:20.506 --> 22:23.593
But with regard to whom I'll help,
I'm here for all Americans.

22:23.718 --> 22:27.722
But more often than not, Inhumans are left
to fend for themselves with few resources.

22:27.805 --> 22:29.557
- So, Inhumans cause more trouble.
- No.

22:29.682 --> 22:33.269
Inhumans are more likely the victims
of hate crimes, which is not fair.

22:33.353 --> 22:35.980
They are our friends,
they are our co-workers...

22:37.440 --> 22:38.733
our brothers.

22:40.777 --> 22:43.321
They all deserve help,
wherever they may be.

22:47.492 --> 22:48.576
Agent Johnson...

22:49.619 --> 22:54.499
let's discuss your theft of more than
seven million dollars from three banks

22:54.665 --> 22:56.709
while you were undercover
from S.H.I.E.L.D.

22:56.793 --> 23:01.214
Illegally acquired funds going towards
illegal activity.

23:01.297 --> 23:04.008
So, you say. Has the U.S. government
recovered those funds?

23:04.175 --> 23:07.470
The money has been distributed
to worthy causes.

23:07.595 --> 23:10.848
I see. So, you took the entire
justice system into your own hands.

23:14.602 --> 23:15.728
<i>We're in position.</i>

23:16.145 --> 23:19.273
<i>Place them around the room,
and they'll give us geometric scans.</i>

23:28.408 --> 23:29.742
<i>Coulson.</i>

23:30.535 --> 23:33.037
Security officers approaching
the location. Hold.

23:37.250 --> 23:39.210
Okay, they're moving past. We're good.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.422
I was working
as a S.H.I.E.L.D. operative...

23:42.547 --> 23:44.757
Without signing the Accords,
so either you committed

23:44.882 --> 23:47.885
an illegal act by robbing banks
or S.H.I.E.L.D. committed an illegal act

23:47.969 --> 23:52.098
- by using an unauthorised enhanced agent.
- Mr Chairman, this line of questioning...

23:52.515 --> 23:54.183
And S.H.I.E.L.D. is still doing it.

23:55.226 --> 23:57.311
<i>Transmitting images now.</i>

24:00.523 --> 24:01.566
Hold on.

24:03.568 --> 24:05.153
What the hell just happened?

24:06.195 --> 24:07.363
What's this?

24:12.368 --> 24:15.121
- Freeze! Stay right there.
- That's her, the fast one.

24:15.580 --> 24:16.789
Leg cuffs go on her.

24:17.540 --> 24:18.499
Radio it in.

24:18.833 --> 24:23.212
Even as we speak, S.H.I.E.L.D. continues
to engage in illegal activity.

24:23.379 --> 24:25.006
- That's not true. No.
- No?

24:25.214 --> 24:28.342
General, moments ago,
my people apprehended

24:28.509 --> 24:30.511
two S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives breaking
into my office.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.805
Seems they were trying to install
surveillance equipment...

24:33.473 --> 24:35.308
to spy on my staff and me.

24:35.766 --> 24:38.394
Uh. There... there must be
some mistake here.

24:38.478 --> 24:39.979
This Inhuman, Ms Rodriguez?

24:40.438 --> 24:43.024
She signed the Sokovia Accords,
but now she's been caught red-handed

24:43.149 --> 24:46.110
in a S.H.I.E.L.D. sanctioned operation
without UN approval,

24:46.235 --> 24:48.571
just as S.H.I.E.L.D. did
with Agent Johnson.

24:49.989 --> 24:53.117
It appears S.H.I.E.L.D. really
is a criminal organisation after all.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.501
That conversation
does not look fun.

25:02.418 --> 25:05.505
I have a feeling no conversation
with that woman is ever fun.

25:05.671 --> 25:08.299
She knew we'd be there.
Not just any Inhuman.

25:08.674 --> 25:11.093
- You specifically.
- There has to be a leak.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.224
Yeah. There has to be.

25:20.186 --> 25:23.523
- Well, we're all free to go.
- Because there's a catch, right?

25:23.648 --> 25:25.650
- Well, maybe a slight...
- You're damn right there's a catch.

25:25.942 --> 25:29.320
There's gonna be a full investigation,
starting with a Senate committee hearing.

25:29.403 --> 25:30.488
They may even bring charges.

25:30.613 --> 25:33.199
That's unlikely, so let's all just take
a beat...

25:33.282 --> 25:36.410
Unlikely? They're gonna drag us
in front of every subcommittee,

25:36.494 --> 25:39.664
- asking us who we are and what we do.
- This was the risk in going legit.

25:39.747 --> 25:41.666
No, this was the risk in going
after Nadeer.

25:41.749 --> 25:43.125
Couldn't have known she'd be ready for us.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.335
Maybe if somebody had warned you first?

25:44.418 --> 25:46.295
- Guys.
- No, you do this all the time, Phil.

25:46.379 --> 25:48.714
I give you the benefit of my expertise,
and you just ignore it.

25:48.839 --> 25:50.341
You're never up front with us, General.

25:50.508 --> 25:52.677
You lied about Taiwan,
you lied to us about Jeffrey...

25:52.760 --> 25:54.136
They kidnapped my son!

25:55.471 --> 25:58.224
And I put Jeffrey in that position
because you have too damn much baggage

25:58.307 --> 26:00.893
- to hold that position yourself.
- We have very different styles.

26:01.227 --> 26:03.563
- We always have.
- And your style just gave the bad guy

26:03.688 --> 26:05.773
all the ammunition she needs to go
after us.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.942
- That's not how I see it.
- Really? How do you see it?

26:08.025 --> 26:10.152
This move just exposed the fact
that we have a leak.

26:10.820 --> 26:12.530
Someone tipped Nadeer off we were coming.

26:13.281 --> 26:14.740
You opposed the op.

26:15.324 --> 26:16.409
Did you warn her?

26:18.911 --> 26:21.414
I believed in you when no one else did,
Phil.

26:23.291 --> 26:25.710
No. I am not the leak.

26:27.128 --> 26:29.589
S.H.I.E.L.D. only exists because of me.

26:31.340 --> 26:32.842
And maybe that's a mistake.

27:02.079 --> 27:04.165
Hello, Agent May.

27:07.543 --> 27:09.420
Time to give this up, please.

27:09.754 --> 27:10.755
No.

27:11.505 --> 27:12.882
You'll have to kill me.

27:13.674 --> 27:14.717
Very well.

27:16.218 --> 27:18.012
But know that it will not make me happy.

27:35.821 --> 27:37.907
- Oh, no.
- Hello, Agent May.

27:40.284 --> 27:41.452
Congratulations.

27:42.161 --> 27:45.206
You got further this time than your
previous attempts at this course.

27:45.706 --> 27:46.874
What is this?

27:47.208 --> 27:48.876
We call it the Framework.

27:49.251 --> 27:51.337
Your journey to escape
Dr Radcliffe's lab,

27:51.504 --> 27:53.381
our fight, all of this...

27:54.507 --> 27:55.800
it's a simulation.

27:55.966 --> 27:59.720
I assure you, you're safe.
We've moved you to another location.

28:00.388 --> 28:01.681
You put this in my head.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.724
Dr Radcliffe knew the best way to keep
you busy

28:03.808 --> 28:05.101
was to give you something to fight.

28:06.227 --> 28:07.937
- Something like you.
- Yes.

28:08.688 --> 28:10.189
But this is the program's end.

28:10.648 --> 28:12.400
We're coding more,
but we can't keep up with you.

28:12.942 --> 28:14.610
You keep getting through it faster.

28:15.236 --> 28:17.154
I'll wipe your memory
and send you through again.

28:17.738 --> 28:20.241
You wipe my memory,
but I get better every time?

28:20.366 --> 28:22.618
Yes. Memory traces.

28:24.078 --> 28:25.371
So, I'm beating it.

28:26.122 --> 28:27.456
And I'll get out eventually...

28:28.666 --> 28:29.959
beat you.

28:30.751 --> 28:32.795
In three, two, one...

28:35.589 --> 28:37.049
Oh, dear. Not again.

28:47.226 --> 28:50.104
I don't know what's going on,
but someone gave us up.

28:50.354 --> 28:53.274
- The senator had inside information.
- I know. Details.

28:53.357 --> 28:55.192
It's like Nadeer had eyes inside our...

28:57.027 --> 28:58.654
our headquarters.

29:02.742 --> 29:04.160
- Hey. J...
- You've been studying Aida

29:04.285 --> 29:06.579
- even though you were ordered not to.
- Yeah, Jemma, okay...

29:06.662 --> 29:07.872
I tried to give you a wide berth

29:07.997 --> 29:10.791
because I knew you were worrying
it through, but this is an obsession.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.585
- You turned it on, didn't you?
- It's not an obsession.

29:12.668 --> 29:13.878
Fitz...

29:14.336 --> 29:16.338
did you turn on Aida's ocular receptors?

29:16.964 --> 29:18.883
Okay. Okay, yes.

29:19.049 --> 29:21.343
I... I see where you're going
with this and you're not wrong...

29:21.427 --> 29:24.513
We personally gave
Radcliffe Deathlok's eye technology.

29:24.597 --> 29:26.891
- Aida has it inside her head, doesn't she?
- Yeah, but Jemma...

29:27.016 --> 29:30.644
A camera, watching us this whole time.
Aida hacked our base.

29:31.187 --> 29:34.440
Hell, it could've been broadcasting.
Nadeer knew the details of our mission.

29:34.607 --> 29:37.276
No, that's impossible. I wasn't
in that briefing. Aida never saw that.

29:37.359 --> 29:41.030
Why on earth would you do this?
You put us all at risk in a hundred ways.

29:41.155 --> 29:44.158
Jemma. Jemma, please.
Just stop, okay? I have a working theory.

29:44.241 --> 29:46.035
I wanted to help you get through
this obsession of yours,

29:46.118 --> 29:48.704
- but if you continue to...
- It's not an obsession!

29:53.626 --> 29:55.252
Jemma, it's an investigation.

30:01.342 --> 30:02.843
What the hell did you do to me?

30:06.639 --> 30:08.849
Answer me. What did you do?

30:08.933 --> 30:11.936
- What tipped you off?
- Because I'm not an idiot. And I got hurt.

30:12.019 --> 30:15.105
Oh, I was worried about injuries,
but there wasn't time to...

30:15.940 --> 30:18.067
Tell me, how does it feel?
What's your reaction?

30:18.192 --> 30:19.443
How does it feel?

30:19.944 --> 30:21.654
How much of me is me?

30:21.821 --> 30:23.239
Am I even me at all?

30:23.364 --> 30:25.783
I assure you,
the real Melinda May is fine.

30:26.325 --> 30:29.286
She's safe and healthy,
and under my protection.

30:30.079 --> 30:31.539
I don't care about your assurances.

30:32.248 --> 30:34.291
You had me spy on my own people.

30:34.792 --> 30:37.670
Your own people! That's delightful.

30:38.546 --> 30:41.715
Please, believe me, everyone is gonna
come out of this all right.

30:42.132 --> 30:43.300
I don't know.

30:43.634 --> 30:45.678
Once I tell Coulson,
it might be rough for you.

30:45.803 --> 30:47.221
You're not telling Coulson.

30:47.972 --> 30:49.265
Why not?

30:50.057 --> 30:52.393
Because you have a mission.
Call it an instinct.

30:52.768 --> 30:54.061
It'll kick in when it's time.

30:54.144 --> 30:56.814
Till then, you won't be able to jeopardise
what you need to do.

30:57.648 --> 30:58.691
What mission?

30:59.441 --> 31:03.362
See, I sent you in unaware
so that you would seem more real.

31:03.487 --> 31:06.699
I didn't want you distracted by such...
things.

31:07.199 --> 31:11.203
You can't know when May's memories end
and my coding begins. It's all one.

31:12.288 --> 31:13.706
You're wrong.

31:14.164 --> 31:16.000
I know it's not easy to accept.

31:16.166 --> 31:19.295
There's enough May in me
to do what has to be done.

31:28.888 --> 31:30.306
You can't. Sorry.

31:31.015 --> 31:31.891
It's programming.

31:33.893 --> 31:35.644
That's why I won't tell Coulson who I am?

31:37.313 --> 31:40.190
Did you program me so I can't tell anyone?

31:40.399 --> 31:41.483
No.

31:42.067 --> 31:44.153
I programmed you so you wouldn't want to.

31:50.743 --> 31:52.661
There's no reason to resist.
You don't need to.

31:52.912 --> 31:54.246
Why don't you simply...

31:55.164 --> 31:56.707
do what you truly want?

31:58.918 --> 32:00.044
What do you think I want?

32:00.794 --> 32:02.004
Come now. We both know.

32:03.631 --> 32:05.299
- You don't know me.
- Mm.

32:06.258 --> 32:11.221
I've been inside your brain.
I know what you want, or, rather...

32:12.264 --> 32:13.265
whom.

32:17.770 --> 32:19.563
See? You do know.

32:21.190 --> 32:23.108
I've seen the closeness between you.
It's always been there,

32:23.192 --> 32:25.319
but you've been resisting that, too.
Why?

32:29.990 --> 32:33.953
If only May... and you, for that matter...
could be happy.

32:35.079 --> 32:37.498
Forget duty and honour and simply take
what you want.

32:37.581 --> 32:39.166
You are who you are.

32:41.210 --> 32:42.419
You're wrong.

32:42.753 --> 32:43.879
I'm not.

32:44.922 --> 32:46.882
But May has no time for happiness.

32:47.758 --> 32:49.593
She's too busy fighting some fight

32:49.718 --> 32:52.304
she's already lost in her past
long enough to enjoy...

32:55.099 --> 32:55.975
Is that it?

32:56.600 --> 32:58.602
Is that what May needs?

33:01.855 --> 33:02.898
Get away from her.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.818
- What's... Fi... Fitz, what's going on?
- You don't talk to him.

33:05.985 --> 33:07.569
Did you think he wouldn't find out?

33:08.112 --> 33:09.947
Fitz had a theory after Aida betrayed
us...

33:10.280 --> 33:12.032
that it wasn't reading the Darkhold
that changed her.

33:12.157 --> 33:14.952
That you programmed her to do it.
He was right.

33:15.077 --> 33:16.412
Fitz, I can explain.

33:20.416 --> 33:22.167
May? What are you doing here?

33:22.918 --> 33:26.005
Something Fitz said got me thinking.
And then the leak.

33:26.213 --> 33:27.715
Came to see what he knew.

33:29.133 --> 33:30.467
And the truth came out.

33:32.678 --> 33:33.971
Get him out of here.

33:43.647 --> 33:45.357
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.485
- How'd the mission go?
- Not well.

33:49.111 --> 33:51.196
- We could have used you.
- Uh...

33:52.698 --> 33:56.702
- Well, I'm sure that...
- I'm tired of playing games, Mack.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.538
Coulson said that if I wanted to know
where you went today,

33:59.621 --> 34:01.248
I should ask, and he's right.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.171
Um...

34:08.005 --> 34:09.422
I went to see my ex.

34:10.674 --> 34:12.717
I... I've been wanting to talk to you
about this, and...

34:13.761 --> 34:15.763
- tell you about Hope.
- Hope.

34:15.971 --> 34:17.764
- Mm-hm.
- All right.

34:18.974 --> 34:20.851
- That's it, then.
- Elena, no...

34:21.435 --> 34:23.645
I've been giving this a lot
of thought.

34:23.771 --> 34:27.357
And you know, we go out to dinner,
and then you do nothing,

34:27.483 --> 34:29.318
and then we do something,
and then you go away.

34:29.443 --> 34:31.695
- Because I don't take this lightly.
- Look, Mack...

34:33.237 --> 34:34.281
I like you.

34:35.157 --> 34:37.493
You know that. But this...

34:39.161 --> 34:42.456
I'm not a jealous woman.
I don't pry, I don't nag.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.458
That's not me. That's a...

34:46.835 --> 34:48.003
That's a cliché.

34:48.754 --> 34:51.255
- And I refuse to be a cliché.
- Yes, I know.

34:51.340 --> 34:54.842
So, if you want to be a man
that has secrets and goes off

34:54.967 --> 34:56.678
and meets other women, that's fine.

34:57.137 --> 35:00.182
But that's another cliché
I'm not interested in.

35:02.935 --> 35:04.686
I love that you're not a cliché.

35:08.774 --> 35:10.192
Hope was my daughter.

35:12.569 --> 35:13.654
And she died.

35:14.154 --> 35:16.615
- Oh, my God.
- No. It's... It's okay. It's...

35:17.157 --> 35:18.200
It was 11 years ago.

35:18.909 --> 35:20.577
My ex, Nicole...

35:22.246 --> 35:23.914
we had a life planned together.

35:25.374 --> 35:27.584
She got pregnant and we were happy.

35:28.460 --> 35:32.381
But... when Hope was born, it was, uh...

35:35.342 --> 35:36.552
it was touch and go...

35:37.719 --> 35:40.472
and she only lived for four days.

35:41.890 --> 35:44.143
Her story was over before it ever started.

35:46.228 --> 35:49.148
- Mack, I didn't know.
- No, I know. I know.

35:53.318 --> 35:54.945
But tomorrow's Hope's birthday.

35:56.613 --> 35:59.867
And Nicole has a hard time with it.
That's why she texted me.

36:01.076 --> 36:03.537
So, I went to see her
so she wouldn't be alone.

36:05.038 --> 36:08.000
Maybe I wanted to spend a day
remembering Hope, also.

36:12.546 --> 36:14.756
I've been wanting to tell you that
for a while.

36:15.757 --> 36:17.509
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mack.

36:32.357 --> 36:34.026
Long day. Drink.

36:37.654 --> 36:39.114
Today wasn't great.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.242
Cauliflower isn't great.

36:43.327 --> 36:44.995
Today was a kick in the balls.

36:45.662 --> 36:47.456
You know that won't be the end of it.

36:47.998 --> 36:50.125
Nadeer busted us.
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s on the ropes again.

36:50.209 --> 36:52.211
- Talbot's pissed.
- Talbot's always pissed.

36:52.753 --> 36:54.671
Yeah. But this time he has a point.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.132
I was reckless.

36:57.424 --> 37:00.719
- Why didn't I listen to him?
- You were protecting your people.

37:01.261 --> 37:03.597
- Yeah, but...
- Reckless? Maybe.

37:04.348 --> 37:05.390
Who cares?

37:06.391 --> 37:07.267
Phil...

37:08.435 --> 37:09.811
we are who we are.

37:11.438 --> 37:12.356
Flaws and all.

37:12.981 --> 37:14.149
And you're fine with that?

37:17.069 --> 37:18.237
Yeah.

37:21.531 --> 37:22.699
I am.

37:34.169 --> 37:36.004
Fitz! Oh, Fitz,

37:36.630 --> 37:39.591
this has all been a big misunderstanding.
You have to believe me.

37:39.716 --> 37:42.177
- Things just got out of control.
- Yeah, they did.

37:42.719 --> 37:45.889
You know, the whole time I was testing
my theory, looking into what you did...

37:46.765 --> 37:48.850
Do you know what I wanted to find
more than anything?

37:49.726 --> 37:51.478
- That I was wrong.
- I know...

37:51.603 --> 37:52.980
Because you're my friend.

37:54.314 --> 37:55.649
But it's a pattern.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.651
I almost hoped this time it was
my paranoia.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.444
I actually hoped I was paranoid.

38:01.321 --> 38:02.447
But no.

38:03.365 --> 38:05.701
- You've turned on everyone.
- No, no, Fitz,

38:05.909 --> 38:08.662
I didn't want to hurt anyone.
I... I... I wanted to help everyone.

38:08.787 --> 38:12.457
That... that's what this is about.
These people matter to me.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.293
You've got a sociopathic way
of showing it.

38:14.501 --> 38:17.087
- I don't bond well with actual people.
- You know that.

38:18.630 --> 38:22.134
When you rescued me from Hive,
they were ready to lock me up.

38:23.010 --> 38:25.554
- You believed in me. You stood by me.
- My mistake.

38:25.679 --> 38:26.596
No, it wasn't.

38:27.055 --> 38:28.473
You've been more than a friend.

38:31.226 --> 38:33.645
- You've been like a son to me.
- Yeah, well...

38:34.771 --> 38:37.816
- that's why this sucks.
- I get overeager, Fitz.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.068
You know that.
But I meant well. I still do.

38:40.736 --> 38:43.113
Talk to them, Fitz.
Help me explain it to them.

38:44.573 --> 38:47.492
- You're mad.
- I wouldn't harm anyone.

38:48.452 --> 38:53.081
My only goal is to preserve life.
My first priority, always.

38:56.668 --> 38:57.586
Right.

39:07.387 --> 39:09.765
Fitz. Fitz, no.

39:10.140 --> 39:12.893
- Wait.
- I need to borrow that, please.

39:15.562 --> 39:19.149
I... I still have feelings.
I still care about you, Fitz.

39:19.733 --> 39:22.110
I've got to hand it to Radcliffe.
You certainly act like it.

39:29.951 --> 39:32.454
I still care about you, Fitz.

39:32.996 --> 39:34.664
I still care about you, Fitz.

39:36.166 --> 39:38.960
I still care about you, Fitz.
Fitz.

39:48.261 --> 39:50.013
Gonna need some assistance.

39:50.680 --> 39:53.183
- Medical and engineering.
- Yes, sir.

39:57.646 --> 39:59.314
Looks like you have a problem.

40:00.399 --> 40:01.483
I knew this was coming.

40:01.983 --> 40:05.070
I knew it the moment Aida failed
to get the Darkhold, I wasn't safe.

40:05.445 --> 40:07.781
- So, I replaced myself.
- And that's when you first called me.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.325
Seemed prudent, given how exposed
I'd become.

40:10.617 --> 40:13.161
I said I needed your protection.
Now you can see why.

40:13.286 --> 40:15.038
But I won't be the one protecting you.

40:16.206 --> 40:17.833
You'll have to meet the Superior.

40:19.501 --> 40:21.211
Fine. Whatever it takes.

40:30.512 --> 40:33.432
How's our guest?
Didn't give you any lip, did she?

40:33.890 --> 40:35.142
Not at all.

40:35.517 --> 40:38.186
She's been a model patient,
even with the move.

40:39.896 --> 40:43.150
- I tried the scenario you suggested.
- Uh-huh. A memory.

40:43.442 --> 40:46.445
Well, an altered memory,
but there was enough for me to work with.

40:46.653 --> 40:48.488
I'm easing her pain.

40:48.697 --> 40:50.740
It's working even better
than the other programs.

40:52.117 --> 40:54.453
May herself proved to be the key.

40:55.370 --> 40:57.873
Peacefulness wasn't enough.
She'd keep fighting.

40:58.206 --> 41:00.000
And fighting wasn't enough. She'd win.

41:00.250 --> 41:03.920
But once I remembered that she was
fighting a fight she'd already lost...

41:05.338 --> 41:07.048
all I had to do was change the fight...

41:08.258 --> 41:10.218
take her back to Bahrain.

41:38.705 --> 41:41.625
Did you see that move?
How did she take out that many people?

41:41.791 --> 41:43.043
Had to have been 30 guys.

41:43.126 --> 41:44.419
They're saying the mother was the one

41:44.503 --> 41:46.254
who made everyone crazy with her powers.

41:46.338 --> 41:49.966
- Agent May took them all on.
- The Cavalry went in after all.

41:53.136 --> 41:54.346
<i>Melinda?</i>

41:55.847 --> 41:57.265
I did it, Andrew.

42:01.269 --> 42:02.646
Thank you.

42:06.441 --> 42:07.651
I saved the girl.

42:09.486 --> 42:10.695
Yeah.
