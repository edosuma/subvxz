07:41.527 --> 07:43.663
- Go!
- Close the door!

07:43.729 --> 07:45.698
- One second.

07:45.765 --> 07:46.766
- Time!

07:46.833 --> 07:48.801
- Come on, uh!

07:48.868 --> 07:51.437
- Wow. You are
a pencil snapping machine.

07:51.504 --> 07:52.805
- Do my forearms look bigger?

07:52.872 --> 07:53.806
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:53.873 --> 07:55.208
- 'Cause they feel
bigger right now.

07:55.274 --> 07:57.276
- Tyler, you just attempted
the Guinness World Records title

07:57.343 --> 07:59.178
for the most
pencils snapped--

07:59.245 --> 08:00.613
- Yes, you did.
- --in 60 seconds.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.582
- Whoo.
- Valid attempt.

08:02.648 --> 08:05.351
And not only
did you break 87 pencils,

08:05.418 --> 08:07.286
but another
Guinness World Records' title!

08:07.353 --> 08:10.289
{\an8}- Yeah!
- Eighty-seven!

08:10.356 --> 08:11.624
{\an8}- That was awesome.
That was amazing.

08:11.691 --> 08:12.792
{\an8}- Dang!

08:12.859 --> 08:14.527
{\an8}- Tyler, you're once
again officially amazing.

08:14.594 --> 08:16.095
- Thank you, Alex!

08:16.162 --> 08:17.530
Wow!

08:17.597 --> 08:19.298
Take that, Record Stealer.

08:19.365 --> 08:21.767
Two records in the bank,
only one more to go.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.636
I think we gotta go big
on this one.

08:23.703 --> 08:25.905
I feel like we're just breaking
all these records, then

08:25.972 --> 08:28.674
this same guy's just gonna come
back and break 'em all again.

08:28.741 --> 08:30.610
We need
an unbreakable record.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.477
Something that nobody can beat.

08:32.544 --> 08:34.647
- We can come up
with something surely.

08:34.714 --> 08:37.216
- Let's do it.
- Let's go give it a shot.

08:37.283 --> 08:38.818
- Come on, Alex.
- Ty, you gotta clean

08:38.885 --> 08:40.720
these pencils up, man.
- Nah, we'll do that later.

08:54.500 --> 08:55.968

08:56.035 --> 08:57.770
We've broken two
Guinness World Records already,

08:57.837 --> 08:59.772
but we still got one empty spot
on the wall.

08:59.839 --> 09:02.575
It's time to team up
and set an unbreakable record.

09:02.642 --> 09:04.143
[whispers] Let's go.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.945
Record Stealer is one man.

09:06.012 --> 09:07.513
We are five guys.

09:07.580 --> 09:09.782
We need to do a record that
involves all five of us,

09:09.849 --> 09:11.717
because then he physically
can't do it.

09:11.784 --> 09:12.985
- It's good.

09:13.052 --> 09:16.989
- What if--we all five shoot
a basketball at remotely

09:17.056 --> 09:20.993
the same time, and they all go
in the net very quickly.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.795
Fr-fr-r-r-r-r-r.

09:22.862 --> 09:24.797
That might have been
one too many.

09:24.864 --> 09:25.932
Fr-r-r-r-r.

09:25.998 --> 09:27.433
- That's way too many.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.501
Fr-r-r, that's better.

09:28.567 --> 09:29.502
- That's about right.

09:29.568 --> 09:30.836
- You can't beat it.
- No.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.939
- Do we wanna go
regular three-point line

09:33.005 --> 09:33.906
or professional?

09:33.973 --> 09:35.341
- I think we go pro.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.044
- So if we're going pro, there's
two ways in my mind to do it.

09:38.110 --> 09:40.579
We either stack in one line--
- Caterpillar.

09:40.646 --> 09:42.715
- --with the goal,
we all shoot at the same time.

09:42.782 --> 09:45.851
The only problem with that is
if one person's arch is a little

09:45.918 --> 09:48.054
bit different, the balls are
gonna be hitting each other.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.322
- I think you spread out.

09:49.388 --> 09:53.092
- And this is gonna take longer
to get to the goal

09:53.159 --> 09:55.061
than shooting up here.
- That's a great point.

09:55.127 --> 09:56.062
- That's science.

09:56.128 --> 09:57.863
- Okay, so let's
do horizontal arch.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.598
- Yes.
- One, two, three, four, five.

09:59.665 --> 10:01.400
And then all we gotta do
is barely stagger.

10:01.467 --> 10:02.468
Boom, five in a row.

10:02.535 --> 10:03.569
- Let's try it.

10:03.636 --> 10:05.371
- Guys, if it's
an unbeatable record,

10:05.438 --> 10:06.939
it's not gonna be easy.
- I agree.

10:07.006 --> 10:08.407
- And I'm wearing
socks and sandals.

10:08.474 --> 10:09.809
- That's a poor choice.

10:09.875 --> 10:12.111
- That's just such
an interesting choice.

10:12.178 --> 10:13.412
- Guys, get around the arch.

10:13.479 --> 10:15.448
Get around the arch.

10:15.514 --> 10:17.049
Getting ready
to attempt world record.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.151
Actually, what's the official
title of this one, Alex?

10:19.218 --> 10:22.989
- Fastest time to make five
basketball three-point shots

10:23.055 --> 10:24.090

10:24.156 --> 10:25.691

15:34.733 --> 15:35.668
So let's start off.

15:35.734 --> 15:37.069
Catapults.

15:37.136 --> 15:38.504
Catapults are probably what
you've seen in movies.

15:38.570 --> 15:39.772
- Yep.

15:39.838 --> 15:41.540
- And there's a few
different types of catapults.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.142
That is called the trebuchet.

15:43.208 --> 15:45.711
It's a very simple machine
that uses counterweights

15:45.778 --> 15:48.013
to launch objects
at really far distances.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.849
I will need an assistant
for part of this.

15:50.916 --> 15:53.052
- Garrett.
- Thanks for volunteering.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.253
- Alright, Garrett Hilbert!

15:54.320 --> 15:57.156
Alright, let's launch some.

15:57.222 --> 15:58.590
- You load your apple
into the sling,

15:58.657 --> 16:00.793
then you pull down
the trigger system and clamp it.

16:00.859 --> 16:02.761
You set your line,
you let it rip.

16:16.375 --> 16:17.943

fine-tune adjustments.

I like your style,

16:30.622 --> 16:32.891
- [groans] A little short.

16:32.958 --> 16:34.693
- If it's short,
you just add some more weight.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.161
That's 13 pounds.

16:36.228 --> 16:38.197
Let's do 15 pounds.
- Okay.

16:38.263 --> 16:40.065

I was close.

If it hits me, it hits me, but I
have a good feeling it won't.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.986
- Do it. Go lay in the middle.

17:01.053 --> 17:02.721
- You're gonna offer yourself--
- On the board.

a little bit of credit here.

17:41.193 --> 17:43.162
I did not think this
would launch an apple that far.

But we gotta go bigger.

17:45.130 --> 17:47.132

17:47.199 --> 17:49.868
- Is it more medievalier
or just medievalier?

17:49.935 --> 17:51.203
- Whatever it is,
we gotta do it.

17:51.270 --> 17:52.504

17:58.010 --> 17:59.311
Tommy, thank you very much.

17:59.378 --> 18:01.580
I think we just need to take
what we learned here,

18:01.647 --> 18:04.283
apply it to the larger scale
basketball shot version.

18:04.349 --> 18:06.151
This is gonna be
a little tougher than we think.

18:52.564 --> 18:54.700
Alright, guys, this last
catapult is even bigger

18:54.766 --> 18:55.834
and badder.

18:55.901 --> 18:58.136
It's got an electric winch,
30 feet tall.

18:58.203 --> 19:00.305
It can launch a ball
over 150 feet,

19:00.372 --> 19:02.875
and weighs a half of a ton.

19:02.941 --> 19:04.409
- Why are we
wearing skirts again?

19:04.476 --> 19:08.080
- Tommy suggested that
we should look the part.

19:08.146 --> 19:10.415
- I feel like
I'm in a private school.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.084
- Should we curtsey
when we make the shot?

19:12.150 --> 19:13.151
- I hope not.

19:13.218 --> 19:14.653
So I think we got a general idea

19:14.720 --> 19:16.455
for how far this will launch
a basketball.

19:16.522 --> 19:18.123
We need two people

Me, Coby, and Cory will stand
here, launch the basketball.

19:24.897 --> 19:27.032
Hopefully that direction.
- Yep.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.367
- I've never moved in a skirt.

19:28.433 --> 19:30.469
So I am a little nervous
of my mobility.

it's gonna be beneficial.

19:32.204 --> 19:33.505

think you have more.

- Oh, wow, there is--
- A lot of freedom.

19:35.407 --> 19:36.508
- Flexibility is significant.

19:36.575 --> 19:38.043
- This is way better
than skinny jeans.
