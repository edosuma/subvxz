00:41.131 --> 00:42.669
You know, it kind of takes
the fun out of things

00:42.737 --> 00:43.771
if I have to explain it.

00:43.838 --> 00:45.205
Oh, I can see
how that could happen.

00:45.274 --> 00:46.376
Right.

00:46.443 --> 00:48.244
Did you find Grant's flask?

00:48.312 --> 00:50.449
Sort of.
There's just, um...

00:50.517 --> 00:51.417
One thing.

00:53.086 --> 00:54.787
One?
Try hundreds.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.188
Hundreds and hundreds
of things.

00:56.256 --> 00:58.691
Agh!

00:58.758 --> 01:00.292
We're looking for a flask

01:00.360 --> 01:02.093
at a Civil War reenactment.

01:02.161 --> 01:04.929
A place where all flasks
go to die.

01:04.997 --> 01:07.532
A world where everyone has
a flask.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.771
Hey, that sounds
like cannon fire.

01:10.839 --> 01:12.241
Brilliant.
There's that college education

01:12.308 --> 01:13.542
rearing its head.

01:13.610 --> 01:15.279
What do you want,
and why did you call me?

01:15.347 --> 01:16.948
Oh, right.
Urgent.

01:17.015 --> 01:18.049
Do you know
where Artie keeps

01:18.116 --> 01:20.019
the tiny little marshmallows?

01:20.087 --> 01:21.354
'Cause he won't tell me.

01:21.422 --> 01:23.423
Like he needs
marshmallows, right?

01:23.491 --> 01:24.391
Hey, Pete?

01:24.459 --> 01:25.592
Yeah.

01:25.660 --> 01:28.194

He's--he's looking pretty good
these days,

01:30.231 --> 01:31.865
don't you think?

01:31.932 --> 01:34.167
It's all the exercise I get
chasing artifacts

01:34.234 --> 01:36.202
without any help.

01:36.270 --> 01:38.037
Ahh...Ahh...

01:38.105 --> 01:39.605
Ah-choo!
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:39.673 --> 01:41.640
Oh, man, Artie.

01:41.708 --> 01:43.709
That cold sounds like
it's getting worse.

01:43.777 --> 01:44.844
You should be resting.

01:44.911 --> 01:46.411
It's a very good idea,
resting.

01:46.479 --> 01:47.946
If only I were paying somebody
to help me

01:48.014 --> 01:49.348
with this kind of thing.

01:49.416 --> 01:51.184
I know, right?
Well, Claudia'll be back soon.

01:51.252 --> 01:52.285
Yeah.

01:55.458 --> 01:56.558
Who made this thing?

01:56.626 --> 01:57.760
Tch.

02:01.765 --> 02:03.833
Talk to me, Goose.

02:03.901 --> 02:05.001

How did this even get
to Dubai anyway?

I mean, it's not like Dubai

on the packing slip, okay?

02:49.417 --> 02:50.584
And--
Is that me?

02:50.652 --> 02:52.453
Oh, my God, I smell.
I smell, don't I?

02:52.521 --> 02:53.855
Okay, so shower.

02:53.923 --> 02:55.557
Shower and then nap
and then warehouse.

02:55.625 --> 02:59.461
But Myka, I have somebody
that I'd like you to meet.

02:59.529 --> 03:01.364

03:13.177 --> 03:15.378
Well, you're not Pete's...

03:15.446 --> 03:17.413
...Mom.

03:17.481 --> 03:19.849
And you're not his sister,
'cause his sister--

03:19.917 --> 03:21.451
but are you--
are you his cousin?

03:21.518 --> 03:23.419
No, no.
I'm not his cousin.

03:23.487 --> 03:24.787
And I'll be changing
the name.

03:24.855 --> 03:27.790
I'm his--

03:27.858 --> 03:31.929
Amanda.

03:31.996 --> 03:34.064

And--and--

03:34.132 --> 03:36.167

03:36.234 --> 03:37.835
And--and you guys--

03:37.903 --> 03:39.303
You guys have met.

03:39.371 --> 03:41.373
Ohhh, that's great.

03:41.440 --> 03:44.109
Well, Amanda new-last-name

03:55.455 --> 03:56.856

I'm--

03:56.923 --> 03:57.957

03:58.024 --> 03:59.325
What?

03:59.393 --> 04:00.960
So let's, uh,
step over this way, shall we?

04:01.028 --> 04:02.161
But I-I would--

04:02.229 --> 04:03.362
Oh, here we go.
Look at this room.

04:03.430 --> 04:04.697
I would--

04:04.765 --> 04:06.365
I would just like
to properly welcome your--

04:07.868 --> 04:09.802
That's rude.

04:09.870 --> 04:10.837
Okay, spill.

04:10.904 --> 04:12.238

04:12.306 --> 04:14.207

Marine?

04:14.275 --> 04:16.877
Oh, uh, I got--
I got reassigned.

04:16.945 --> 04:18.178
- Reassigned.
- Mm-hmm.

04:18.245 --> 04:20.248
Here, from D.C.
mm-hmm.

04:20.315 --> 04:22.116
That's a punishment.
What'd you do this time?

04:22.184 --> 04:23.418
No, no, no, no.
No, no.

04:23.486 --> 04:24.686
- Oh, please.
- No, I--

04:24.754 --> 04:25.787
No, I didn't do anything.

04:25.855 --> 04:26.988
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, no, wait.

04:27.056 --> 04:28.289
I--that's--
let me--

04:28.357 --> 04:30.524
I did something,
but it was a good thing, okay?

04:30.592 --> 04:31.992
That's why I'm here.

04:32.060 --> 04:33.560
Whatever it was,
I'm sure it wasn't intentional.

04:33.628 --> 04:34.828
Uh, no, it wa--

04:34.896 --> 04:36.229
it's a--it was--
it's a promotion.

04:36.297 --> 04:37.431
A promotion
to "You-nee-ville."

04:37.498 --> 04:38.665
"Uhn-eh-ville."

04:38.733 --> 04:39.966
And what are you doing
in Univille, anyway?

04:40.034 --> 04:41.434
Oh.

04:41.502 --> 04:44.737
Oh.

04:44.805 --> 04:47.206
I found something
that belongs to you.

04:50.944 --> 04:52.612
Shut it.

04:52.680 --> 04:55.716
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

<i>Legendmakers,</i> first edition?

04:58.319 --> 04:59.619
Ha, ha, ha!

04:59.687 --> 05:01.021
Okay, how do you do that?

05:01.089 --> 05:02.489
And just like that,
you're a 12-year-old boy.

05:02.557 --> 05:03.757
Ohhh.

05:03.825 --> 05:05.793
I never thought that I would see
this again.

05:07.529 --> 05:09.396
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

05:09.464 --> 05:10.731

05:13.134 --> 05:16.136

- Okay.

05:23.511 --> 05:26.013
- Hey, Amanda.
- Yeah?

05:26.081 --> 05:29.216
Are you gonna tell me why
you're really here?

05:32.888 --> 05:34.655
It's disconcerting how well
we know each other,

05:34.723 --> 05:38.326
isn't it?

05:38.393 --> 05:41.796
Um...

05:41.864 --> 05:45.066
I'm getting remarried.

05:45.133 --> 05:47.001

05:50.673 --> 05:51.906

05:52.975 --> 05:54.076
Congratulations.

05:54.143 --> 05:55.777
So when is the wedding?

05:55.845 --> 05:57.545
- Tomorrow, actually.
- It's tomorrow!

05:57.613 --> 05:59.347
That's--oh, that's--

05:59.415 --> 06:00.381
tomorrow.

06:00.449 --> 06:01.549

06:01.617 --> 06:03.118
but apparently,
I have to get clearance

06:03.186 --> 06:04.419
to talk to my ex-husband now.

06:04.487 --> 06:06.554
You have no idea
the kind of governmental hoops

06:06.622 --> 06:07.922
I had to jump through
to get here.

06:07.990 --> 06:10.692
You know what?
I don't know if I can...

06:10.760 --> 06:12.561
Get away on such short notice.

06:12.628 --> 06:15.430
Oh, sorry, Pete.
I, um--

06:15.498 --> 06:18.733
I didn't come here
to invite you.

06:18.801 --> 06:20.535
I came to get
my grandfather's ring.

06:20.603 --> 06:22.037
Oh.

06:22.104 --> 06:23.938
The ring.

06:24.006 --> 06:25.607
You know what?
I still have that, don't I?

06:25.674 --> 06:27.108
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, no, no.

06:27.176 --> 06:29.611
No, please, I--
let me, uh--

06:29.679 --> 06:31.413
it's, um--
it's upstairs.

just looking

07:20.066 --> 07:21.467
I was looking--or Leena.
Leena would do.

07:21.534 --> 07:23.602

Would I do?

Oh, hi.
Hi!

I was looking for--

07:28.775 --> 07:30.042
Me!

07:30.110 --> 07:31.544
He was looking for me
because I'm back.

07:31.612 --> 07:32.445
Right, exactly.
She's back.

07:32.512 --> 07:34.080
I wanted to welcome her back.

07:34.147 --> 07:35.614
Well, now you've seen her.

07:35.682 --> 07:36.749
Yeah.

She's seen you.

07:52.767 --> 07:54.468
Married? You were married?

07:54.535 --> 07:55.735
I don't believe you.

07:55.803 --> 07:57.604
Can't I have any privacy
around here?

07:57.672 --> 07:58.638
- And you--
- Me?

07:58.706 --> 07:59.806
Sneaking around.

07:59.874 --> 08:00.874
I'm not sneaking.

08:00.942 --> 08:02.342
There was no sneaking.
Sneaking!

08:04.245 --> 08:05.345
Okay, okay, okay.
Show's over.

08:05.413 --> 08:06.613
He is absolutely right.

08:06.681 --> 08:07.915
Myka, I am ashamed of you.

08:07.983 --> 08:09.283
Nosing around like that.

08:09.351 --> 08:11.519
This man--this man needs
his privacy.

08:11.586 --> 08:14.322
Huh-huh.

08:14.390 --> 08:15.623
- Married.
- Ah-choo!

08:15.691 --> 08:17.392
Bless you.
How could you not--

08:17.460 --> 08:18.527
- Go.
- What?

08:18.594 --> 08:21.262
Upstairs, now.
Go, go, go, go.

08:31.340 --> 08:32.774
Sorry about that.

08:32.842 --> 08:35.010
They're, uh--
I was gonna say "Butt pains,"

08:35.078 --> 08:36.745
but okay.

08:38.214 --> 08:40.015
Oh.

08:40.082 --> 08:43.418
Uh...

08:43.486 --> 08:45.287
So this is it, huh?

08:45.355 --> 08:49.158
Our, uh, our reason
for seeing each other.

08:49.226 --> 08:52.460
Well, I guess this is it.

08:52.528 --> 08:53.795
Uh, look, Amanda.

08:53.863 --> 08:54.997
You pretty much missed out

08:55.064 --> 08:58.333
on the whole amends part
of my life.

08:58.401 --> 08:59.568
I mean, not--

08:59.636 --> 09:02.405
not that you were exactly
around, either.

09:02.473 --> 09:04.107
So I guess I--

09:04.175 --> 09:05.308
I guess I never thought

09:05.376 --> 09:08.946
that I was gonna have
to do this.

09:10.381 --> 09:13.817
And now that I hear it
out loud, it...

09:13.885 --> 09:18.689
Sounds like such a cop-out.

09:18.756 --> 09:21.324
The thing is, um,

09:21.392 --> 09:24.528
the reason that I never have...

09:25.931 --> 09:27.098
Is because you're
the hardest one

09:27.165 --> 09:30.001
to make amends to.

09:33.138 --> 09:36.608
I really screwed us up.

09:36.676 --> 09:40.212
Amanda, I'm sorry.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.382
Thanks.

09:43.450 --> 09:44.750
And listen, Pete, it's--

09:44.818 --> 09:46.419
it's water under the bridge.

09:46.487 --> 09:49.455
And I think everything
worked out for the best.

09:51.624 --> 09:53.291
I guess so.

09:53.359 --> 09:54.792
Now what about this guy?

09:56.295 --> 09:58.496
What's--it's not--

09:58.564 --> 10:00.164
it's not anyone I know,
is it?

10:00.232 --> 10:01.398
Of course not.

10:01.466 --> 10:05.702
Oh, God,
thanks for that.

10:05.770 --> 10:07.504
He's the one, though, huh?

10:07.572 --> 10:09.440
Yeah, he really is.

10:09.508 --> 10:10.875
I mean, not that you weren't.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.510
It's just--
it's different this time.

10:12.578 --> 10:15.647
You know, Michael,
he's sweet and charming--

10:15.715 --> 10:17.082
You had me at yes.
Shhhht.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.417
So let's--
--

10:18.485 --> 10:20.687
shut 'er down.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.055
Oh, I'm just--
I'm just excited

10:22.122 --> 10:23.056
about the wedding.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.224
I know.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.725
You know,
fairy tale and castle.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.427
I mean, it's a rented castle
in the Poconos,

10:27.495 --> 10:29.296
but still.

10:29.363 --> 10:31.298
Um, I've been one
of a few good men

10:31.365 --> 10:32.632
for a long time,

10:32.699 --> 10:36.068
so I'm ready to just be
a princess for a day.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.337
Well, you deserve it.

10:38.404 --> 10:41.273
The prince and the fairy tale.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.881
All of it.

11:10.571 --> 11:11.538
Thanks, Pete.

11:11.605 --> 11:15.341
Yeah.

11:15.409 --> 11:18.744
Be happy, Amanda.

11:18.812 --> 11:21.080
I will be.

11:24.250 --> 11:31.489
♪ ♪

11:34.160 --> 11:35.160
Well, why was she here?

11:35.228 --> 11:36.561
Alimony?

11:36.629 --> 11:38.964
Are you two striking up
the band again, or...

11:39.032 --> 11:40.866
What? No.
She's getting remarried.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.735
What?
Why didn't she just call?

11:42.803 --> 11:44.236
That doesn't make sense at all.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.971
Stop. That's why
I didn't tell you, okay?

11:46.039 --> 11:49.441
I don't want to talk
about it.

11:56.015 --> 11:57.582
Ah...

11:57.650 --> 11:59.317
Pete, you're--
you're right.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.952
- Ah-choo!
- I'm sorry.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.788
Your private life
is none of our business.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.357
We shouldn't have intruded.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.329
You know...

12:11.397 --> 12:12.964
It wasn't just one thing.

12:13.032 --> 12:16.100
I mean, mostly,
it was because we were...

12:16.168 --> 12:18.069
Just too young.

12:18.136 --> 12:21.205
Least, I was too young.

12:21.273 --> 12:23.674
Amanda was--
I mean, she was very driven.

12:23.742 --> 12:27.211
She always knew
exactly what she wanted.

12:27.279 --> 12:29.981
It's what the Marines call
a-a hard charger.

12:30.049 --> 12:32.217
Oh, man.

12:32.284 --> 12:34.552
She was...

12:34.620 --> 12:35.820
...Amazing.

12:35.888 --> 12:38.724
I mean,
of course she's a Major now.

12:38.792 --> 12:42.161
And--and I...

12:42.229 --> 12:44.397
...was not amazing.

12:44.465 --> 12:46.833
I-I didn't know
what I wanted,

12:46.901 --> 12:48.167
and I definitely wasn't ready

12:48.235 --> 12:50.470
for a lifetime commitment.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.571
I mean, not then.

12:52.639 --> 12:55.207
Now I-I just wonder.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.276
If it could've worked?

12:58.344 --> 12:59.377
Yeah.

12:59.445 --> 13:00.345
No.

13:00.412 --> 13:01.379
Maybe.

13:01.447 --> 13:02.447
No.

13:02.514 --> 13:04.115
Uh, people?

13:04.182 --> 13:05.849
We have a problem.

13:05.917 --> 13:08.785
One beehive, one bee.

13:17.029 --> 13:18.896
We are missing the bee.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.433
I don't know
what the bee does,

13:21.501 --> 13:22.801
but if it was
in Warehouse 2,

13:22.869 --> 13:25.937
we can bet it was probably
something bizarre

13:26.005 --> 13:26.971
and deadly.

13:27.039 --> 13:28.673
We'd better find it now.

13:28.741 --> 13:31.142
Okay, look.
I-I came in here.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.978
And I put the beehive
right here.

13:34.046 --> 13:35.080
Right, right.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.214
I remember because--

13:39.418 --> 13:40.385
You gasped.

13:40.453 --> 13:41.620
You rarely gasp.

13:41.687 --> 13:42.921
Pete's right.
Why did you gasp?

13:42.989 --> 13:44.822
- Leena?
- Amanda.

13:44.890 --> 13:47.726
Amanda's bag was right there.

13:55.636 --> 13:58.171
Pollen.

13:58.238 --> 14:01.608
If Amanda somehow triggered
the latch...

14:01.675 --> 14:04.110
Then the bee...

14:04.178 --> 14:07.013
Could've fallen right into--

14:07.081 --> 14:08.114
No!

14:08.182 --> 14:10.216
No, no, no, no, no!

14:10.284 --> 14:13.619
An artifact did not fall
into my ex-wife's bag

14:13.687 --> 14:18.257
on her way to her perfect
fairy-tale wedding.

14:18.325 --> 14:19.391
No, that did not happen.

14:19.458 --> 14:22.427
Artie's law of artifacts
states

14:22.495 --> 14:26.797
the worst thing that can happen
with an artifact

14:26.865 --> 14:28.600
will happen
with an artifact.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.735
It's in Amanda's bag.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.838
Now you can panic.

14:59.123 --> 15:00.056
Amanda.

15:01.125 --> 15:02.258
Hey.

15:02.326 --> 15:04.928
There's my future husband.

15:04.995 --> 15:05.962
Hi.

15:06.029 --> 15:09.365
Welcome back.
I missed you.

15:09.432 --> 15:10.365
I missed you, too.

15:10.433 --> 15:11.567
Oh, look, I got the ring.

15:11.634 --> 15:12.935
Great.

15:16.072 --> 15:17.406
Ow!

15:17.474 --> 15:20.143
- You all right?
- Yeah, just...

15:20.211 --> 15:23.013
Oh, there's the bride at last.

15:23.081 --> 15:25.282
And I need to talk to you
about the caterer.

15:25.350 --> 15:27.318
I think he's a complete idiot.

15:27.385 --> 15:28.686
Okay.

15:28.753 --> 15:32.524
Guess I'll see you
at the altar.

15:32.591 --> 15:33.892
Whew.

15:40.934 --> 15:41.934
Fire!

15:46.106 --> 15:47.206
And after the whole hoopla

15:47.274 --> 15:49.309
with the inter-dimensional
space,

15:49.376 --> 15:51.578
I realized what I really wanted
was to be a Warehouse Agent.

15:52.747 --> 15:53.814
So what about you?

15:53.881 --> 15:54.881
What's your story?

15:54.949 --> 15:56.082
You know my story.

15:56.150 --> 15:58.285
A.T.F.,
Jimi Hendrix' guitar,

15:58.353 --> 16:01.188
and the first time
I saw Artie's eyebrows.

16:01.256 --> 16:03.124
No, I mean, like,
before all that.

16:03.192 --> 16:05.994
Well, before all that
is the past.

16:06.062 --> 16:08.430
Which is where I'd like
to keep it.

16:08.498 --> 16:10.132
Oh, well,
word of warning:

16:10.200 --> 16:11.500
At the warehouse,

16:11.568 --> 16:13.402
the past doesn't always stay
in the past.

16:13.469 --> 16:14.569
Literally.

16:14.637 --> 16:16.371
Did I mention
we have a time machine?

16:16.439 --> 16:18.673
Why doesn't that surprise me?

16:18.741 --> 16:19.774
Look, it isn't here.

16:19.842 --> 16:21.576
Are you sure?

16:21.643 --> 16:23.945
Silver flasks, gold flasks,
wooden flasks,

16:24.012 --> 16:25.879
flasks with flaps,
flasks with knobs.

16:25.947 --> 16:28.215
I get it.
Lotta flasks.

16:28.283 --> 16:29.750
Look, we've been
through this trunk twice,

16:29.817 --> 16:31.184
and none of them match
the description,

16:31.252 --> 16:32.919
so why don't we just
shut this whole shindig down?

16:32.987 --> 16:34.921
We'll flash badges, and we'll
body-search 'til we find it.

16:34.989 --> 16:37.190
Because that's not
what we do.

16:37.258 --> 16:39.726
I mean, Warehouse Agents,
uh, we use stealth.

16:39.794 --> 16:41.094
We're stealthy.

16:41.162 --> 16:43.597
I mean, can you imagine
how these nut jobs would react

16:43.664 --> 16:45.599
when they find out that somebody
has Ulysses S. Grant's flask?

16:45.667 --> 16:47.201
The guys are carrying
real bayonets!

16:47.269 --> 16:48.836
Exactly, and if one
of them drinks from it,

16:48.904 --> 16:50.672
and he starts believing
that he's fighting that war

16:50.740 --> 16:52.307
while he's carrying
a bayonet,

16:52.374 --> 16:53.608
Artie said
at the last reenactment--

16:53.676 --> 16:55.076
I know,
the reenactor with the flask

16:55.144 --> 16:56.511
went postal
and stabbed two soldiers.

16:56.578 --> 16:57.912
I know,
but we still use stealth.

16:57.980 --> 16:59.280
Just really,
really fast stealth.

16:59.348 --> 17:03.083
So then what's the plan,
o stealthy one?

17:03.151 --> 17:04.885
I--listen,
I don't exactly have a--

17:08.690 --> 17:11.258
oh.

17:14.994 --> 17:16.430
Why do I feel like Laverne?

17:16.497 --> 17:17.998
Oh, no, you're not Laverne.
I'm Laverne.

17:18.065 --> 17:19.999
You're Shirley.

17:20.067 --> 17:21.601
Oh, I am not Shirley.

17:28.143 --> 17:30.110
I've been doing a little digging

17:30.177 --> 17:31.578
to find--ah...
Ah-choo!

17:31.646 --> 17:33.480
Uh, to find out
what this beehive artifact

17:33.548 --> 17:34.915
actually does.

17:34.983 --> 17:37.185
I'm a little rusty
on my hieroglyphics, so--

17:37.252 --> 17:38.953
and no age jokes, please.

17:39.021 --> 17:40.322
So it make take me
a little time.

17:40.389 --> 17:42.458
Okay, Artie, just--
just let us know.

17:49.166 --> 17:50.467
Wow.

17:50.535 --> 17:51.701
This is a lot nicer

17:51.769 --> 17:53.235
than the "Love Me Tender" chapel
in Vegas.

17:53.303 --> 17:54.337
Oh, tell me you didn't.

17:54.404 --> 17:55.471
Oh, yeah, yeah.

17:55.539 --> 17:56.939
That is the dress.
Oh, my gosh.

17:57.007 --> 17:58.674
You were supposed to bring
something blue.

17:58.741 --> 17:59.975
Wait, wait, wait.

18:00.042 --> 18:01.476
No, I was supposed to bring
the garter.

18:01.544 --> 18:02.911
- No, I was supposed--
- You got it confused.

18:05.113 --> 18:06.581
Ow.

18:06.648 --> 18:10.317
Oh, Amanda,
you look so beautiful.

18:10.385 --> 18:11.685
This thing's getting worse.

18:11.753 --> 18:12.653
Look at that.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.021
Oh, God, on your wedding day.

18:14.089 --> 18:17.726
- What did you do?
- That looks awful.

18:17.793 --> 18:19.694
Amanda...

18:19.762 --> 18:23.132
You poor thing.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.567
I'll get you a band-aid.

18:24.635 --> 18:27.403
Triple antibiotic.
You need triple antibiotic.

18:27.471 --> 18:28.538
Okay.

18:28.605 --> 18:30.306
Ten-hut!

18:30.374 --> 18:31.875
Marines!

18:31.942 --> 18:33.676
Major!

18:33.744 --> 18:34.643
Amanda.

18:36.313 --> 18:37.679
You look great, Major.

18:37.747 --> 18:40.248
I'm so glad you made it.

18:40.316 --> 18:41.550
Sir, you look fantastic.

18:41.617 --> 18:43.751
Oh, thanks, guys.

18:43.819 --> 18:45.153
It's ma'am.

18:46.889 --> 18:49.523
So glad you guys are here.

18:49.591 --> 18:51.658
You should sit down
and rest, Major.

18:51.726 --> 18:53.326
Put your feet up.

18:53.394 --> 18:54.595
No, I'm okay, thanks.

18:54.662 --> 18:55.796
You need to conserve
your energy.

18:55.864 --> 18:57.465
I'll get you a chair.

18:57.533 --> 19:01.836
No, I'm good, guys.

19:01.904 --> 19:05.073
Excuse me.

19:05.141 --> 19:07.009
Pete--
uh, Myka, right?

19:07.076 --> 19:08.143
What are you doing here?

19:08.211 --> 19:10.145
Wow.

19:10.213 --> 19:12.448
You--you--you look--

19:12.516 --> 19:13.849
wow.

19:13.917 --> 19:16.585
Amanda, we're really sorry
to intrude,

19:16.653 --> 19:18.020
but, uh--

19:18.088 --> 19:21.657
We have a little problem.

19:23.726 --> 19:26.995
Um, can we talk to you
for a minute?

19:38.673 --> 19:40.508
So what's with the parade?

19:40.575 --> 19:42.376
Is this what happens
when you become an officer?

19:42.444 --> 19:43.444
It's the bridal party.

19:43.512 --> 19:45.079
Marines take their job
seriously.

19:45.147 --> 19:47.248
I was a Marine.
I was never a stalker.

19:47.316 --> 19:49.317
Okay, is there somewhere
we can talk privately?

19:49.384 --> 19:50.284
Oh.

19:50.352 --> 19:51.352
So exciting.

19:51.420 --> 19:53.555
Oh, no, it's Mike's parents.

19:53.622 --> 19:55.557
His mother doesn't know
how to end a sentence,

19:55.624 --> 19:57.158
let alone a conversation.
Just do me a favor.

19:57.226 --> 19:59.294
I have to talk to my friends
for a minute,

19:59.361 --> 20:01.129
so just take care of the Martins
for me, all right?

20:01.197 --> 20:02.164
I don't care
what you have to do.

20:02.231 --> 20:03.698
Just keep 'em away from me.

20:03.766 --> 20:06.601
Let's go in here.

20:10.006 --> 20:12.375
Hello.
What's going on?

20:12.443 --> 20:14.177
Is this some sort
of Marine thing?

20:14.245 --> 20:15.211
We're looking for our son.

20:15.279 --> 20:16.312
Oof!

20:16.380 --> 20:18.582
Oh, no!

20:27.031 --> 20:27.964
So what is the problem?

20:28.032 --> 20:29.532
We can't tell you.

20:29.600 --> 20:30.734
Why not?

20:30.801 --> 20:32.301
We can't tell you.

20:32.369 --> 20:33.636
It's just that when you
were at the B & B,

20:33.703 --> 20:36.205
something got loose.

20:36.273 --> 20:37.940
Got loo--
what kind of something?

20:38.008 --> 20:40.176
Uh, we can't tell you
that, either.

20:40.243 --> 20:41.677
Pete, if this is about me
getting remarried--

20:41.745 --> 20:43.079
Wait, wait, whoa.

20:43.147 --> 20:45.014
What? No, okay?
Scout's honor.

20:45.082 --> 20:47.116
You were kicked out
of the scouts when you were ten.

20:47.184 --> 20:48.684
I did not start
that fire.

20:48.752 --> 20:49.985
Look, Amanda, trust me.

20:50.053 --> 20:51.053
This isn't about you.

20:51.121 --> 20:52.688
Then why are you here?

20:52.756 --> 20:54.290
Look, it's need-to-know,
Major.

20:54.357 --> 20:59.028
And you don't need to know.

20:59.095 --> 21:00.929
Fine, fine.

21:00.997 --> 21:02.330
Whatever this problem is,

21:02.398 --> 21:03.699
what are you gonna do
to fix it?

21:03.766 --> 21:05.134
Or can you not tell me
that, either?

21:05.201 --> 21:07.135
We just need
to search your bag.

21:07.203 --> 21:08.971
It's actually that bag.

21:09.039 --> 21:10.706
Pete?

21:10.774 --> 21:12.407
It's a great dress.

21:12.475 --> 21:14.777
Really.

21:14.844 --> 21:16.078
Sorry.

21:18.582 --> 21:21.083
My Sandy Alomar Junior
signed baseball?

21:21.151 --> 21:22.452
Backup plan.

21:22.519 --> 21:24.487
I wasn't sure the comic book
would work.

21:24.555 --> 21:26.522
So does this have something
to do with your new job?

21:26.590 --> 21:27.890
Why you're in "you-nee-ville"?

21:27.958 --> 21:29.325
"Uh-neh-ville."

21:29.393 --> 21:30.994
So you weren't lying.
It really is a promotion.

21:31.061 --> 21:33.563
Ha-ha!
Ha, ha, ha!

21:36.133 --> 21:38.434
Behold!

21:38.502 --> 21:40.170
Bee-hold.

21:40.237 --> 21:42.038
- Bee-hold, I--
- Yeah.

21:42.106 --> 21:44.407
All right, yeah.

21:44.475 --> 21:48.243
Um, you might, uh,
you might wanna duck.

21:50.079 --> 21:52.347
Welp, there you go.
Bam.

21:52.415 --> 21:55.451
Well, no dead bodies,
no mass destruction,

21:55.519 --> 21:57.586
no swarm of killer bees,
although I gotta tell ya,

21:57.654 --> 21:58.588
it did cross my mind.

21:58.655 --> 21:59.889
So much for Artie's law.

21:59.957 --> 22:02.325
What was that?
Some kind of weapon?

22:02.393 --> 22:06.263
Uh, that is your wedding
being saved.

22:06.331 --> 22:09.801
Okay, so the good news is,
is that it is over.

22:09.869 --> 22:12.871
All right, then.
Thank you for...

22:12.939 --> 22:14.740
Taking care
of whatever that was.

22:14.808 --> 22:16.175
Yeah, yeah.
Um, no worries.

22:16.243 --> 22:19.145
Listen, uh, we're sorry
to barge in like that.

22:19.212 --> 22:21.847
And, uh,
you shalln't see me again.

22:24.218 --> 22:26.586
Pete.

22:26.654 --> 22:31.225
Um, could I talk to you
for a second?

22:31.292 --> 22:32.726
I'm gonna go see
if there's a moat.

22:32.794 --> 22:34.294
I hope there's a moat
because I really--

22:34.361 --> 22:36.596
I love the--
the moats.

22:36.664 --> 22:39.498
She loves moats.

22:39.566 --> 22:41.367
Chaaarrrge!

22:44.204 --> 22:45.404
Well, now that we're
stealthy,

22:45.472 --> 22:46.639
do you have any ideas
how to find this flask

22:46.707 --> 22:47.640
in a haystack?

22:47.708 --> 22:48.674
I don't know, mingle?

22:48.742 --> 22:50.109
See if there's anyone here

22:50.177 --> 22:51.978
taking this whole reenactment
business too seriously?

22:52.045 --> 22:54.680
Run, ya scurvy yanks,
run!

22:56.150 --> 22:58.385
I kinda think showing up
covers that category.

22:58.452 --> 23:00.721
Okay, nix the negativity,
all right, sand master?

23:00.789 --> 23:02.423
Think of it like when you were
a kid, you know?

23:02.490 --> 23:03.624
Get into it.

23:03.692 --> 23:05.293
Oh, what,
there was no make-believe

23:05.360 --> 23:06.594
in your mysterious past?

23:06.662 --> 23:09.197
I say we hoist a musket
and enter the fray.

23:09.265 --> 23:10.732
And I say that we talk
to that guy.

23:14.370 --> 23:15.970
Did you know the guy
who hit you?

23:16.038 --> 23:17.439
It was Private Johnson.

23:17.507 --> 23:19.375
Guy went crazy right
in the middle of a skirmish.

23:19.442 --> 23:21.676
Started punchin' other players

23:21.744 --> 23:23.378
and hitting 'em with the butt
of his rifle.

23:23.446 --> 23:25.680
I mean, we have rules
against that sort of thing.

23:25.748 --> 23:27.449
Was he drinking
out of a flask?

23:27.516 --> 23:28.750
Well, I--you know,
I suppose so.

23:28.818 --> 23:30.552
I mean, we all are.

23:30.619 --> 23:32.854
It's about half the fun.

23:34.423 --> 23:35.957
- You're dead, rebel!
- Huh?

23:36.025 --> 23:38.193
So are you, yank!

23:40.363 --> 23:42.130
Long live Abe Lincoln!

23:44.433 --> 23:47.836
What?
I'm getting into this.

23:47.904 --> 23:48.870
Hey, lie down.

23:48.938 --> 23:50.272
You're dead.

23:50.339 --> 23:52.240
Huh? No.
Oh, no, I'm not dead.

23:52.308 --> 23:53.475
I'm just--
I'm just wounded.

23:53.543 --> 23:55.310
Yeah, oh, in the leg, I think.

23:55.377 --> 23:57.045
Yeah, it's--it's cool.
I can still fight.

23:57.113 --> 23:59.014
Hey, do you know how much
it cost

23:59.081 --> 24:00.382
to defoliate these trees

24:00.449 --> 24:02.283
to make it look
like the Battle of Shiloh?

24:02.351 --> 24:04.218
We're committed professionals.

24:04.286 --> 24:07.921
And you, rebel dog,
are dead.

24:07.989 --> 24:09.189
All right.

24:09.257 --> 24:10.524
Don't get your long Johns
in a bunch.

24:10.592 --> 24:11.959
I'm going.

24:12.026 --> 24:14.127
So, now,
if you're dead,

24:14.195 --> 24:16.596
does that mean you're still
the Senior Agent here?

24:16.664 --> 24:20.134
Just find Johnson.

24:20.202 --> 24:23.271
Look for the craziest guy
out here.

24:23.339 --> 24:25.740
So Pete,

24:25.808 --> 24:29.245
I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry, too.

24:29.313 --> 24:31.747
What you said
back at "you-nee-ville"--

24:31.815 --> 24:32.648
- "Uh-neh-ville."
- Stop that.

24:32.716 --> 24:35.618
Right.

24:35.686 --> 24:37.453
It wasn't all your fault.

24:37.521 --> 24:39.722
I--

24:39.790 --> 24:42.091
it was easy at the time
to blame your drinking,

24:42.159 --> 24:44.227
but...

24:44.295 --> 24:46.329
Takes two
to screw up a tango.

24:46.397 --> 24:49.666
Yeah, well, I was never really
much of a Pacino.

24:49.734 --> 24:52.035
I was more of a Tom Cruise,
you know.

24:52.103 --> 24:53.537
Yeah, you're Maverick.
I remember.

24:53.605 --> 24:55.639
Thank you.

24:55.707 --> 24:58.208
The thing is...

24:58.276 --> 25:01.245
Back then, I just...

25:01.313 --> 25:03.948
I just wanted so much.
I wanted to do so much.

25:04.016 --> 25:06.117
And I couldn't let anything
get in my way,

25:06.185 --> 25:09.253
including you.

25:09.321 --> 25:14.392
Maybe if I hadn't been
so headstrong...

25:14.460 --> 25:17.494
Who knows?

25:17.562 --> 25:20.364
Yeah.

25:20.432 --> 25:21.899
But hey.

25:21.967 --> 25:23.600
Look at you now, Major.

25:23.668 --> 25:27.137
Um, got your Cinderella dress.

25:27.205 --> 25:29.373
I've never seen you
look happier.

25:32.944 --> 25:37.014
I-I think--
I think things worked out

25:37.081 --> 25:39.916
exactly the way
they were supposed to.

25:41.753 --> 25:43.053
Amanda, have you seen
my parents?

25:43.121 --> 25:44.688
I can't find them anywhere.

25:44.756 --> 25:45.757
Hey.
Hey.

25:45.824 --> 25:47.192
Aren't you--
isn't he, uh--

25:47.259 --> 25:48.560
Pete, yeah.

25:48.628 --> 25:49.995
- Pete.
- Yes.

25:50.063 --> 25:51.563
Glad you could make it.
Good to finally meet ya.

25:51.631 --> 25:53.832
Oh, well, you just had to be
nice, didn't you?

25:53.900 --> 25:55.500
Pete was--

25:55.568 --> 25:58.003
Listen, Michael, uh,

25:58.070 --> 26:02.340
you got yourself
a fine little Major there, so.

26:02.407 --> 26:03.741
Thank you.

26:07.378 --> 26:08.745
Why don't you and I
go find your parents?

26:08.813 --> 26:09.979
Yeah.

26:10.047 --> 26:11.848
I am just dying
to chat with your mom.

26:11.915 --> 26:13.515
So that was the groom, huh?

26:13.583 --> 26:15.784
Yeah, can you believe it?

26:15.852 --> 26:17.886
Well, your ex definitely has
a type.

26:17.954 --> 26:19.388
Uh, what?

26:19.456 --> 26:21.356
You think that guy
looks like me,

26:21.424 --> 26:23.625
with the hair
and the square jaw

26:23.693 --> 26:25.393
and the Captain America
attitude?

26:25.461 --> 26:26.728
Please.

26:26.795 --> 26:29.563
I'm so much cooler
than that.

26:29.631 --> 26:32.066
It's the weirdest thing.

26:32.134 --> 26:33.901
My folks,
they just disappeared.

26:33.969 --> 26:35.403
We'll find them, Michael,
all right?

26:35.471 --> 26:36.938
Nobody gets in or out of here
until we do.

26:37.005 --> 26:39.440
I'm gonna go look for them.

26:39.508 --> 26:40.575
You just stay here and do

26:40.643 --> 26:41.943
whatever it is
that brides do, okay?

26:42.011 --> 26:45.381
And when we find them,
at exactly 1500 hours,

26:45.448 --> 26:46.682
come hell or high water

26:46.750 --> 26:48.317
or in-laws or exes,

26:48.385 --> 26:51.087
we are getting married.

26:51.155 --> 26:54.090
And I'll finally be
Mrs. Michael Martin.

26:54.158 --> 26:56.559
And I will finally
own you, woman.

26:58.462 --> 27:01.731
No one gets in or out of here.

27:01.798 --> 27:03.399
I'll finally own you, woman.

27:03.467 --> 27:05.234
Come on, let's go.

27:05.301 --> 27:06.668
Okay.

27:06.736 --> 27:07.969
Whoa, hi.

27:08.037 --> 27:10.138
Excuse us.

27:10.206 --> 27:12.040
- Nobody in or out.
- That's what she said.

27:12.107 --> 27:13.107
Okay.

27:13.175 --> 27:17.478
Excuse u--

27:17.546 --> 27:18.813
Look, Marines.

27:18.880 --> 27:20.381
There's no reason
to get worked up here.

27:20.449 --> 27:22.249
We were just leaving,
and I--

27:22.317 --> 27:23.517
- Pete?
- I'm all right.

27:23.585 --> 27:27.255
No, no, I mean, Pete!

27:27.322 --> 27:29.423
Nice hats.

27:29.491 --> 27:30.724
Run!

27:35.630 --> 27:38.565
♪ ♪

27:38.633 --> 27:39.499
Help me!

27:43.737 --> 27:47.806
- Artie's law.
- Oh, yeah.

27:47.874 --> 27:49.574
"It's a wedding, Pete.

27:49.642 --> 27:51.176
Why would we need
our Teslas?"

27:51.244 --> 27:53.711
What is this, Pete?

28:03.516 --> 28:04.783
Where'd the rest of them go?

28:04.851 --> 28:06.652
What the hell is happening?

28:06.720 --> 28:08.454
Michael is out there,
and his parents.

28:08.522 --> 28:09.689
I'm sorry,
but right now,

28:09.757 --> 28:11.291
I'm worried about the guys
with swords.

28:11.359 --> 28:12.692
Spit it out, Lattimer.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.728
I assume this is all
being caused by your little

28:14.795 --> 28:15.928
top-secret
whatever-it-is.

28:15.996 --> 28:17.497
I told you, need-to-know.

28:17.564 --> 28:18.798
Given that we're being
attacked

28:18.866 --> 28:20.233
by my own wedding party,

28:20.301 --> 28:22.135
I'm pretty sure
I need to know.

28:25.106 --> 28:27.707
The beehive artifact once
belonged to a female pharaoh

28:27.775 --> 28:29.642
who ruled Egypt
around 1479 B.C.E.,

28:29.710 --> 28:30.844
Hatshepsut.

28:30.912 --> 28:31.878
- Bless you.
- Uh, what? No.

28:31.946 --> 28:33.313
That wasn't a sneeze.

28:33.381 --> 28:35.782
That was the female pharaoh's
name, Hatshepsut.

28:35.850 --> 28:37.417
So Hatshepsut created
the artifact

28:37.485 --> 28:40.488
using the pheromones
of honey bees.

28:40.555 --> 28:43.458
Well, beehive, bee.
It makes sense.

28:43.525 --> 28:46.161
Yes, and then she would
prick herself with the bee

28:46.229 --> 28:49.031
and then inject the stinger,
really, into her body.

28:49.099 --> 28:50.566
She became the queen bee.

28:50.634 --> 28:51.801
Precisely.
Ah-choo!

28:51.869 --> 28:53.703
What about her?

28:53.771 --> 28:55.038
What about who?

28:55.105 --> 28:57.439
You--you just said
Hatshepsut.

28:57.507 --> 28:58.941
Oh, no, that--
that was a sneeze.

28:59.009 --> 29:01.910
Wait, you--
you said stinger.

29:01.977 --> 29:07.681
Artie, you--
you did say stinger.

29:07.749 --> 29:09.683
Okay, Artie,
I'm looking at this bee,

29:09.751 --> 29:12.086
and there is no stinger.

29:14.823 --> 29:17.859
Fire!

29:23.099 --> 29:25.334
Forward!

29:25.402 --> 29:27.136
Die, scum!

29:27.204 --> 29:28.871
Come on, you rebel dog!

29:28.939 --> 29:30.640
Dude, what the hell?
I shot you.

29:30.708 --> 29:32.809
Come on, you rebel dog.
Fight like a man.

29:32.877 --> 29:33.744
Come on, man,
put the gun down.

29:33.811 --> 29:34.711
I killed you.

29:34.779 --> 29:36.546
You mock me, traitor.

29:36.613 --> 29:39.982
But I shall be victorious
for my great country!

29:40.049 --> 29:41.750
No, no, no.

29:41.818 --> 29:44.152
I have come
to aid you, brother.

29:44.220 --> 29:46.054
Together we will--
To hell with this.

29:46.122 --> 29:48.356
Hey!

29:48.424 --> 29:50.458
Johnson, listen.

29:50.526 --> 29:52.560
I'm not actually
a reenactor.

29:52.628 --> 29:54.928
The truth is you've got
something very dangerous.

29:54.996 --> 29:56.163
Agh!

29:56.231 --> 29:57.832
Die, scum!

29:57.900 --> 29:59.167
Stop!

29:59.235 --> 30:00.902
Stop, sir, I beg of you.

30:00.970 --> 30:02.404
You would not raise your hand
against a lady,

30:02.472 --> 30:03.439
would you?

30:03.506 --> 30:04.740
I would never harm a woman.

30:04.808 --> 30:06.942
But I intend to kill
this scurvy grayback.

30:07.010 --> 30:09.411
'Fraid not.

30:12.315 --> 30:13.749
Told you I was Laverne.

30:13.817 --> 30:15.451
Such a Laverne move.

30:15.519 --> 30:17.286
Come on, Shirley.

30:20.557 --> 30:22.391
What?
Oh, the mini-Tesla?

30:22.459 --> 30:24.526
It's my own design.
It's pretty cool, huh?

30:24.594 --> 30:27.296
Dude, that should be
your drag name, Minnie Tesla.

30:30.133 --> 30:31.534
Okay, they have these outfits

30:31.601 --> 30:33.402

30:33.469 --> 30:36.905

30:36.973 --> 30:38.840
what? What?
What'd I do?

30:38.908 --> 30:40.775
No, uh,
no, no, no, no.

30:40.843 --> 30:42.944
It's not--it's--
nothing, it's not you.

30:43.012 --> 30:45.548
It's just that
for a second there,

30:45.615 --> 30:48.684
you were a lot like
my big sister.

30:48.751 --> 30:51.386
You know, she used to save
my butt a lot

30:51.454 --> 30:52.788
when we were little.

30:52.856 --> 30:55.491
So you do have a past.

30:55.559 --> 30:57.293
And a sister.
Well, tell.

30:57.361 --> 30:58.728
What's she like?
Where's she live?

30:58.795 --> 30:59.929
What's she do?
Details.

30:59.997 --> 31:02.632
No, she...

31:02.700 --> 31:04.969
Well, she died, Claud,
a while back.

31:08.340 --> 31:10.708
How do I always do that
with you?

31:10.776 --> 31:14.178
God, I'm sorry, Jinksy.

31:14.246 --> 31:15.513
It's okay, really.

31:15.580 --> 31:18.315
It's, uh,
it's all good.

31:18.383 --> 31:21.184
Right, well, let's, um,

31:21.252 --> 31:25.521
snag it and bag it
and get the hell outta here.

31:25.589 --> 31:27.489
What all else
do you have in there?

31:27.557 --> 31:30.592
I got a PB&J,
if you're hungry.

31:34.864 --> 31:39.000
Forget I asked.

31:39.068 --> 31:40.469
Damn Trekkies.

31:40.537 --> 31:41.904
Always crashing the party,

31:41.972 --> 31:45.942
pretending they're
time-travelers.

31:46.010 --> 31:49.780
Pft, what a nerd.

31:49.848 --> 31:52.116
Tell me you found it.

31:52.184 --> 31:53.384
Sort of.

31:53.452 --> 31:54.819
Uh, Amanda's been stung.

31:54.886 --> 31:56.687
Did she touch anyone?

31:56.754 --> 31:59.889
Aside from her whole
bridal party, no.

31:59.957 --> 32:01.725
I'm thinking the finger
is the source of the infection,

32:01.792 --> 32:03.326
so don't let her touch
anyone else with it.

32:03.393 --> 32:04.727
Artie, we checked her finger.

32:04.795 --> 32:06.062
There's no sign
of the stinger.

32:06.129 --> 32:07.563
Yeah, it makes its way
through the body.

32:07.631 --> 32:08.830
It targets the glands,

32:08.898 --> 32:10.432
and it causes
the pheromone production.

32:10.499 --> 32:11.900
And then,
whenever she touches anyone,

32:11.967 --> 32:13.568
she immediately creates
these worker bees

32:13.636 --> 32:15.103
who become slavishly devoted

32:15.171 --> 32:16.605
to her every need
and protection.

32:16.672 --> 32:17.939
Is that why
they're chasing us?

32:18.007 --> 32:19.841

32:19.909 --> 32:21.076
Because you're seen
as a threat.

32:21.144 --> 32:24.412

32:24.480 --> 32:25.380
Yes, yes.

32:25.448 --> 32:27.683
It appears that things

32:27.750 --> 32:29.818
went very badly
for Hatshepsut.

32:29.886 --> 32:31.420

how to get the stinger out.

That's what we'll do.
We'll X-ray her.

And there we go.

40:02.773 --> 40:04.073
Hey, uh...

40:04.141 --> 40:06.809
So listen, I-I just--
I want to say I'm sorry

40:06.877 --> 40:08.377
for not telling you
about Amanda.

40:08.445 --> 40:09.679
I-I should've.

40:09.746 --> 40:11.914
No, it's none of my business.

40:11.982 --> 40:13.016
It wasn't the marriage

40:13.083 --> 40:15.518
that I was trying
to keep secret.

40:15.585 --> 40:17.453
It was me.

40:17.521 --> 40:20.856
Um, the guy I was before.

40:20.923 --> 40:22.090
Pete the drunk.

40:22.158 --> 40:23.358
Pete the loser.

40:23.426 --> 40:24.426
You don't have to--

40:24.493 --> 40:25.993
No, Myka, it's true.

40:26.061 --> 40:27.895
It's, um--

40:27.963 --> 40:29.396
you've never met that guy,

40:29.464 --> 40:30.798
and I don't ever want
you to.

40:30.865 --> 40:32.366
You know, I just--

40:32.434 --> 40:35.069
I want you and Artie and Claudia
and everyone here

40:35.137 --> 40:37.805
to know the Pete I am now.

40:37.873 --> 40:41.042
Fair enough.

40:41.110 --> 40:43.846
Okay.

40:43.913 --> 40:47.549
Hey--hey, Pete.
That new husband, Michael?

40:47.617 --> 40:51.120
He's a tool.

41:02.033 --> 41:04.701
That's, um...

41:04.769 --> 41:06.603
That's why I joined the A.T.F.

41:06.671 --> 41:08.405
I-I didn't--
I was just--

41:08.472 --> 41:10.473
I--

41:11.642 --> 41:14.511
I'm sorry.

41:14.579 --> 41:17.280
I'm really sorry, Steve.

41:17.348 --> 41:21.651
It's okay.

41:21.719 --> 41:24.721
She, um...

41:24.789 --> 41:27.757
She was 20.
She was your age.

41:27.825 --> 41:30.794
I-I-I shouldn't have been
digging around.

41:30.862 --> 41:32.029
You don't have to talk
about it

41:32.096 --> 41:34.064
if you don't want to.

41:34.132 --> 41:36.900
No, I think that I want to,

41:36.967 --> 41:41.071
Laverne.

41:41.139 --> 41:42.573
You would've liked her.

41:42.641 --> 41:45.376
Yeah, I think you two
would've been good pals.

41:49.148 --> 41:52.550
God, she was, um...

41:52.618 --> 41:54.986
Such a hero to me.

41:55.054 --> 41:57.088
She was funny and smart,

41:57.156 --> 42:01.026
and she was always...

42:01.094 --> 42:04.463
Always there for me.

42:04.531 --> 42:08.868
There was this one time...

42:08.936 --> 42:11.370
Geez, you know, I--

42:11.438 --> 42:13.539
I think that you would've done
the exact same thing.

42:13.607 --> 42:15.808
We were--
we were at the park.

42:15.875 --> 42:17.176
We were shooting hoops.
She was, uh--

42:17.243 --> 42:19.511
she was short,
but she had this amazing layup.

42:19.578 --> 42:20.845
And these kids came,

42:20.913 --> 42:22.514
and they were gonna
beat the crap out of me,

42:22.582 --> 42:24.316
and she disappeared,
and then all of a sudden...
