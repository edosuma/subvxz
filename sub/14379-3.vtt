00:45.116 --> 00:46.183
Stupid Dee Dee.

00:46.216 --> 00:48.333
Of all the sisters
in the world,

00:48.366 --> 00:51.450
why do I have to
get the one
that is stupid?

00:51.483 --> 00:54.050
Dee Dee:
Ok. I'm ready.

00:54.083 --> 00:55.200
You can come in now.

00:55.233 --> 00:56.383
All right, Dee.

00:56.416 --> 00:58.316
Stupid Dee Dee.

00:58.350 --> 00:59.366
All right, Dee Dee.

00:59.400 --> 01:02.300
I know
I lost the wager
fair and square

01:02.333 --> 01:04.316
and I agreed
that if I lost,

01:04.350 --> 01:06.366
I would play
one of your stupid
little games,

01:06.400 --> 01:08.316
but I am a very busy
boy genius,

01:08.350 --> 01:10.166
so let's just
make this quick.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.066
Dee Dee? Dee Dee?

01:12.100 --> 01:14.083
Dee Dee!

01:14.116 --> 01:15.483
Dexter,

01:16.016 --> 01:18.366
I am the all-knowing,

01:18.400 --> 01:20.350
all-seeing

01:20.383 --> 01:22.016
madam Dee Dee.

01:22.050 --> 01:26.333
Using the power of
my enchanted crystal ball,

01:26.366 --> 01:30.483
I will tell
your future.

01:31.383 --> 01:35.166
You are
about to sit down.

01:35.350 --> 01:37.200
Dee Dee,
did you not know

01:37.233 --> 01:38.416
that we scientists
are skeptical

01:38.450 --> 01:41.450
about these types
of fortune-telling
phenomenon?

01:41.483 --> 01:44.400
Put simply, we do
not believe in it.

01:44.433 --> 01:48.333
I knew you
were going to say that.

01:48.366 --> 01:50.166
You will believe.

01:50.200 --> 01:51.400
You will!

01:51.433 --> 01:53.416
Fine.
Just make it quick.

01:53.450 --> 01:57.166
As I gaze deep
into the crystal ball,

01:57.200 --> 01:58.333
I see...

01:58.366 --> 02:01.333
I see you.

02:01.366 --> 02:04.300
You've got
a whole new look.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.083
A brand-new look?

02:06.116 --> 02:07.283
That is ridiculous.

02:07.316 --> 02:10.433
Why mess with
success, eh, baby?

02:10.466 --> 02:11.366
Ha cha!

02:11.400 --> 02:14.083
I'm seeing
something else.

02:14.116 --> 02:19.050
Very soon, you will
be surrounded by...

02:19.083 --> 02:20.150
Hot men.

02:20.183 --> 02:22.050
What you
talking about,
Dee Dee?

02:22.083 --> 02:23.033
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

02:23.066 --> 02:24.350
The crystal ball
don't lie, sugar.

02:24.383 --> 02:25.300
Ha ha ha!

02:25.333 --> 02:27.100
Well, anyway,
let us move on.

02:27.133 --> 02:29.016
What else
do you see?

02:29.050 --> 02:30.316
I see
you will encounter

02:30.350 --> 02:35.233
a hopping mad
polka-dotted bunny.

02:35.266 --> 02:36.466
Now, that's
just dumb.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.433
Oh, wait.
I see something.

02:39.466 --> 02:40.400
What is it?

02:40.433 --> 02:44.033
Some words. Yes!
I can read them.

02:44.066 --> 02:46.083
What do they say?

02:46.116 --> 02:47.266
They say...

02:47.300 --> 02:50.483
"Dee Dee is stupid."

02:51.016 --> 02:52.066
I'm out of here,
sister.

02:52.100 --> 02:54.066

02:54.100 --> 02:55.266

02:55.300 --> 02:59.050
I'm seeing
one more thing.

02:59.083 --> 03:01.033
Save it
for next season.

03:01.066 --> 03:04.350
But, Dexter,
this looks really bad,

03:04.383 --> 03:07.100
really, really bad.

03:07.133 --> 03:08.150
All right, crazo.

03:08.183 --> 03:10.033
Thank you so much
for the warning.

03:10.066 --> 03:11.450
See you next time
I'm in crazy land.

03:11.483 --> 03:14.116
Have fun being crazy
while I'm away.

03:14.150 --> 03:17.000
Boy, she has really
lost it this time.

03:17.033 --> 03:21.200
That fortune-telling stuff
is a load of bull pucky.

03:21.416 --> 03:22.316
Uh, what?

03:22.350 --> 03:24.183
Look. The lamp
is unplugged.

03:24.216 --> 03:26.333
I will just
plug it back in.

03:26.366 --> 03:27.366
Aah!

03:27.400 --> 03:29.033
[Sigh]

03:29.066 --> 03:31.016
There must be
some faulty wiring.

03:31.050 --> 03:34.266
Mom and dad should
look into some electrical work.

03:34.300 --> 03:37.100
My hair, it is atrocious.

03:37.133 --> 03:40.200
Could this be
Dee Dee's prediction?

03:41.166 --> 03:42.050
Huh?

03:42.083 --> 03:43.116
No one there.

03:43.150 --> 03:46.166
Just a coincidence.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.150
Hey, Dexter.

03:47.183 --> 03:49.350
Dad, did you
just see a snowman?

03:49.383 --> 03:52.100
Snowman? The last
time I saw a snowman

03:52.133 --> 03:53.350
was last Christmas.

03:53.383 --> 03:55.000
Why?
Did you see one?

03:55.033 --> 03:57.000
It might be
christmastime
right now.

03:57.033 --> 03:58.200
Ooh, I love
christmastime--

03:58.233 --> 04:00.350
the presents,
the trees, the food.

04:00.383 --> 04:02.000
Oh, boy. Oh, boy!

04:02.033 --> 04:04.450
No, dad. I mean,
like, someone
in a snowman costume

04:04.483 --> 04:06.150
lurking around the house.

04:06.183 --> 04:08.100
Costume? You mean
like Halloween?

04:08.133 --> 04:09.400
Oh, I love
Halloween.

04:09.433 --> 04:12.333
Thanks for the tip,
Dex.

04:12.366 --> 04:15.316
Well, dad seems to be
acting normal.

04:15.350 --> 04:16.333
Hey, mom.

04:16.366 --> 04:17.400
Thanks for lending me
the flashlight.

04:17.433 --> 04:19.483
Oh, no problem, dear.

04:20.016 --> 04:20.383
Hi, mom.

04:20.416 --> 04:22.116
Oh, hello,
Dee Dee.

04:22.150 --> 04:23.083
Hey, Dexter.

04:23.116 --> 04:24.466
Anything the matter?

04:25.000 --> 04:25.366
No.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.050
Are you sure?

04:27.083 --> 04:29.116
You sound kind of
creeped out.

04:29.150 --> 04:30.200
Well, I'm not.

04:30.233 --> 04:31.333
I told you,

04:31.366 --> 04:34.383
I do not believe
in that crazy
mumbo jumbo jive.

04:34.416 --> 04:39.350
We'll see, Dexter.
We'll see.

04:40.116 --> 04:45.066
Mom, I have been
having one of those
stressful days again.

04:45.100 --> 04:47.233
Oh, well,
I'm making cookies.

04:47.266 --> 04:48.216
Would you like one?

04:48.250 --> 04:50.350
Maybe it'll make you
feel better.

04:50.383 --> 04:53.000
Cookies? That
sounds delicious.

04:53.033 --> 04:53.400
Yes, please.

04:53.433 --> 04:56.216
Be careful.
They're hot.

come true.

me
that it was Halloween today.

in costume.

come true.

future events is uncanny.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.016
Wait a minute.

05:30.050 --> 05:32.450
What was the last thing
Dee Dee was trying to tell me?

05:32.483 --> 05:35.100
She said
it was really bad.

05:35.133 --> 05:38.433
I had better find out
before it is too late.

05:39.133 --> 05:41.033
Dee Dee!

05:41.066 --> 05:43.083
Dee Dee, you've
got to help me.

05:43.116 --> 05:45.100
Oh, what's
the matter, Dex?

05:45.133 --> 05:46.383
You have to
see into the future.

05:46.416 --> 05:49.016
Tell me
what terrible thing
you saw.

05:49.050 --> 05:52.083
But I thought
you didn't believe in
all that.

05:52.116 --> 05:53.016
I didn't,

05:53.050 --> 05:54.483
but all that stuff
you said,

05:55.016 --> 05:56.016
it came true.

05:56.050 --> 05:58.383
Please tell me
my future.

05:58.416 --> 06:00.433
So now
do you believe?

06:00.466 --> 06:02.000
Yes, yes.

06:02.033 --> 06:04.250
Now tell me what
your crystal ball
shows.

06:04.283 --> 06:05.283
Ok!

06:05.316 --> 06:09.200
I have to look deep
into my crystal ball

06:09.233 --> 06:11.100
for this one.

06:11.133 --> 06:13.400
It's very hazy,

06:13.433 --> 06:15.183
but...

06:15.216 --> 06:16.400

06:16.433 --> 06:19.100
I see it.

from something.

06:24.400 --> 06:30.100

all around the house.

Yes? Yes?

Yes. It is all true.

out of you, Dexter.

in your palm, too.
