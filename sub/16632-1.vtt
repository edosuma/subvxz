00:36.569 --> 00:39.138
- Our planet
faces a lot of problems.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.406
But in some parts of the world,

00:40.408 --> 00:43.409
people live in a time
of over-consumption,

00:43.411 --> 00:47.513
abundance of food, and an
eagerness to be fit and healthy.

00:47.515 --> 00:50.082
The supermarket is
overflowing with options.

00:50.084 --> 00:54.153
But despite that, we are
poorly advised in nutrition,

00:54.155 --> 00:56.121
and easily vulnerable
to misinformation,

00:57.490 --> 01:00.592
and unreliable slogans,
inaccurate health promises,

01:00.594 --> 01:02.694
and colorful tempting packages

01:02.696 --> 01:05.364
are cluttering our
relationship with food,

01:05.366 --> 01:07.566
and risking our well-being.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.401
We are bombarded by
conflicting information

01:09.403 --> 01:12.671
about food, diets
and supplements.

01:12.673 --> 01:15.274
So how can we know
what's best for us?

01:15.276 --> 01:17.376
Which foods improve
health, and which ones

01:17.378 --> 01:19.611
can potentially promote disease.

01:19.613 --> 01:22.848
I have struggled with these
questions for a long time.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.850
And it has been a
challenge to find a diet

01:24.852 --> 01:28.287
that would help me
achieve my health goals.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.722
After trying several new
diets over the years,

01:30.724 --> 01:33.559
I decided to change
my lifestyle,

01:33.561 --> 01:35.594
by simply incorporating
lots of plant-based

01:35.596 --> 01:37.729
foods into my diet.

01:37.731 --> 01:40.165
So far, it has worked for me.

01:40.167 --> 01:42.601
I lost 50 pounds, brought
my blood pressure,

01:42.603 --> 01:45.404
blood sugar and
cholesterol under control,

01:45.406 --> 01:47.639
and overall, felt really good.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.208
But it was a work in progress,

01:49.210 --> 01:50.809
and I still had many
questions and concerns

01:50.811 --> 01:54.613
about nutrition and living
this plant-based lifestyle

01:54.615 --> 01:57.583
for the long run,
especially now with a recent

01:57.585 --> 02:00.719
addition to our family, i
felt that I really needed

02:00.721 --> 02:02.688
to find answers.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.590
So I decided to go on a journey,

02:04.592 --> 02:06.358
to search for the
truth, and to uncover

02:06.360 --> 02:09.527
many of the myths
surrounding food.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.697
For three years, I traveled
across the country,

02:11.699 --> 02:14.199
and interviewed the
world's top authorities

02:14.201 --> 02:16.902
on the subject, as well as
people that had experienced

02:16.904 --> 02:20.272
amazing, life changing benefits
through healthy eating.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.642
All to explore the idea
of what is the healthiest

02:23.644 --> 02:27.146
and most sustainable
diet for ourselves,

02:27.148 --> 02:29.715
future generations,
and our planet.

02:31.284 --> 02:33.619
So join me on this journey
of shocking discoveries,

02:33.621 --> 02:36.889
and buckle up, because
what you're about to learn

02:36.891 --> 02:39.191
might forever change the
way you look at the food

02:39.193 --> 02:40.526
on your plate.

02:54.807 --> 02:56.341
- Well, there's a lot
of difference of opinion

02:56.343 --> 02:59.811
about it, and there's
a faction of people

02:59.813 --> 03:01.680
who insist that there
are different diets

03:01.682 --> 03:03.549
for different people.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.250
But I think that the
evidence is fairly clear that

03:05.252 --> 03:06.618
that's not true,
and there really is

03:06.620 --> 03:08.787
an appropriate diet for humans,

03:08.789 --> 03:10.556
just like there's a best
diet for cats, dogs,

03:10.558 --> 03:13.692
elephants, and any other mammal.

03:13.694 --> 03:17.529
And the best diet for humans
is one that is plant-based,

03:17.531 --> 03:20.265
almost all calories
coming from four principle

03:20.267 --> 03:22.301
food groups, fruit,
vegetables, whole grains

03:22.303 --> 03:23.502
and legumes.

03:23.504 --> 03:26.205
It's low in fat, high in fiber.

03:26.207 --> 03:28.307
Not very much processed
food, none is great,

03:28.309 --> 03:30.876
but in today's world, I don't
know how realistic that is.

03:30.878 --> 03:34.680
- What we have seen in
nutrition for many, many years,

03:35.782 --> 03:38.784
I must say, is a
lot of confusion.

03:38.786 --> 03:40.886
You go and survey
people, you know,

03:40.888 --> 03:42.521
outside of the science,
and ask them what do

03:42.523 --> 03:44.556
they think that nutrition is,

03:44.558 --> 03:46.692
and you can hear all
kinds of comments.

03:46.694 --> 03:47.893
I eat this, and I eat that,

03:47.895 --> 03:49.861
and this is good,
and this is not good.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.396
There's also confusion
in the professions.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.998
You know, medical
doctors are not trained

03:53.000 --> 03:54.399
in this field.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.635
And there's confusion
in my own field.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.337
You know, about
medical research.

03:58.339 --> 04:01.240
We don't get an opportunity,
to tell, you know,

04:01.242 --> 04:03.942
the real science I think,
the way it should be told.

04:03.944 --> 04:06.378
Because we're overwhelmed,

04:06.380 --> 04:09.648
with the corporate sector
trying to sell stuff.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.683
- We are living
in extreme times.

04:11.685 --> 04:14.953
Where we have 27% of people
dying of heart disease,

04:14.955 --> 04:18.023
25% of cancer, 10% of stroke,

04:18.024 --> 04:20.291
four or five percent
from diabetes,

04:20.293 --> 04:22.694
the same number for Alzheimer's.

04:22.696 --> 04:25.497
I mean, these are,
in many, many cases,

04:25.499 --> 04:27.766
diseases of
nutritional ignorance,

04:27.768 --> 04:31.403
and diseases that are all
based on our lifestyle choices.

04:31.405 --> 04:32.871
- There are a lot of
different dietary theories

04:32.873 --> 04:36.875
out there, but I think one
fact is kind of indisputable.

04:36.877 --> 04:40.712
Having a diet that is rich
in whole plant-based foods,

04:40.714 --> 04:44.583
is truly a great way to
get you to good health.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.618
- Everywhere I go
around the world,

04:46.620 --> 04:48.453
there's not a single person
I've met that doesn't

04:48.455 --> 04:50.289
know that fruits and
vegetables are good for them.

04:51.057 --> 04:51.056
We all know it.

04:51.058 --> 04:55.060
It's not about the knowing,
it's about the doing.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.396
- There was a time when
there was no heart disease.

04:57.398 --> 05:01.366
No colon cancer, no breast
cancer, no multiple sclerosis,

05:01.368 --> 05:02.934
no inflammatory arthritis.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.704
Of course these days, in
Asia, the middle east,

05:05.706 --> 05:08.540
in central America,
and around the world,

05:08.542 --> 05:10.642
people have become rich.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.045
They have given up
much of their starch,

05:13.047 --> 05:14.946
and they replaced it
with meat and dairy.

05:14.948 --> 05:17.582
Throughout history, rich
people, the royalty,

05:17.584 --> 05:20.952
the pharaohs, the
queens and the kings,

05:20.954 --> 05:24.056
the priests, the
priestesses, the people

05:24.058 --> 05:25.824
that could afford
to eat the meat.

05:25.826 --> 05:29.728
They had artery disease,
they had obesity,

05:29.730 --> 05:30.996
they were sick.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.397
Nothing's changed
except for the number

05:32.399 --> 05:34.566
of kings and queens
living in the world.

05:36.936 --> 05:39.438
- A question
kept coming to my mind.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.540
If plant foods are
so good for us,

05:41.542 --> 05:43.108
and the consumption
of animal products

05:43.110 --> 05:45.811
in excess appears to do us harm,

05:45.813 --> 05:48.447
how about the ancient
populations of people

05:48.449 --> 05:50.515
that survived on
diets based off mostly

05:50.517 --> 05:52.617
meat, eggs and dairy,

05:52.619 --> 05:54.553
and appeared to be healthy?

05:54.555 --> 05:57.556
After all, aren't we known
for being hunter-gatherers?

05:59.826 --> 06:02.861
- All large, successful
populations of people

06:02.863 --> 06:04.763
have gotten the bulk
of their calories

06:04.765 --> 06:07.366
from starch, rice,
corn, potatoes,

06:07.368 --> 06:09.868
and other starches,
breads and so on.

06:09.870 --> 06:13.405
Particularly when you
live near the equator,

06:13.407 --> 06:16.007
as you move north and
south in latitude,

06:16.009 --> 06:18.510
then you end up eating
more animal foods.

06:18.512 --> 06:21.513
And if you get far
north, like for example,

06:21.515 --> 06:24.449
the inuit eskimos, they
are largely carnivores,

06:24.451 --> 06:26.985
because that's what's available.

06:26.987 --> 06:30.522
But that's a small
population of people

06:30.524 --> 06:32.858
that exists on the extremes
of the environment.

06:33.626 --> 06:35.427
That's the exception,

06:35.429 --> 06:36.661
not the rule.

06:38.531 --> 06:40.632
- We have become
the most successful

06:40.634 --> 06:42.901
species on this planet.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.736
No one comes close to us.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.639
We share it with animals,
and insects, and microbes,

06:47.641 --> 06:50.509
and plants, but
we're number one.

06:50.511 --> 06:51.943
And the way we got to number one

06:51.945 --> 06:54.546
was all about survival.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.748
We see in color, i
believe, because fruits

06:56.750 --> 06:58.650
and vegetables are colorful.

06:58.652 --> 07:01.153
Our hand is perfectly
designed to pick,

07:01.155 --> 07:05.490
forge, grab and dig,
peel, and feed ourselves

07:05.492 --> 07:07.125
fruits and vegetables,
nuts, beans and seeds,

07:07.127 --> 07:10.061
plant food, food made
by mother nature.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.731
- This idea that we're
hunter-gatherers,

07:13.633 --> 07:15.200
is true, we're hunter-gatherers.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.669
But mostly, we've
been gatherers.

07:17.671 --> 07:20.639
One of the problems
has to do with sexism.

07:20.641 --> 07:23.708
It has to do with the
fact that the gatherers

07:23.710 --> 07:27.512
were grandparents,
women, and children.

07:27.514 --> 07:30.549
The hunters were men,
and they got the glory.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.150
The people who really
provided the bulk

07:32.152 --> 07:35.687
of the calories, for most
of the civilizations,

07:35.689 --> 07:38.523
through all verifiable
human history,

07:38.525 --> 07:41.726
have been the women,
children and grandparents.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.596
- Even when i
began considering the idea

07:44.598 --> 07:47.065
of eating mostly a
plant-based diet,

07:47.067 --> 07:49.701
I was still hounded
with many questions.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.203
How was I going
to be able to live

07:51.205 --> 07:53.505
without animal foods?

07:53.507 --> 07:55.607
I didn't want to become
nutrient deficient.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.709
And how about things
like protein, calcium,

07:57.711 --> 07:59.544
and omega 3's?

07:59.546 --> 08:01.913
In my head, I always
associated these nutrients

08:01.915 --> 08:03.849
with animal foods.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.851
I needed to find out
if those were valid

08:05.853 --> 08:08.186
concerns, or simply myths.

08:16.229 --> 08:18.897
- It's almost
impossible to design

08:19.699 --> 08:21.800
a protein deficient diet

08:21.802 --> 08:24.002
surrounding, you know, a variety

08:24.004 --> 08:26.605
of whole plant foods.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.607
- What people need to know

08:28.609 --> 08:31.710
is there's never been a
case of protein deficiency

08:31.712 --> 08:33.511
ever described in
the world literature,

08:33.514 --> 08:35.914
on any natural diet,

08:35.916 --> 08:38.683
that met the sufficient
amount of calories.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.150
- You know, back to
1839 when protein

08:40.153 --> 08:44.022
was discovered, it had
this incredible reverence

08:44.024 --> 08:47.259
associated with it, and
it just gained traction.

08:47.261 --> 08:49.261
But the evidence is
very clear that humans

08:49.263 --> 08:51.897
do not need to eat
a lot of protein,

08:51.899 --> 08:54.566
and when they do, they get
a lot of health problems

08:54.568 --> 08:54.566
as a result.

08:54.568 --> 08:58.703
I mean human protein needs
are just a tiny percentage

08:58.705 --> 09:01.106
of calories, maybe two
and a half, three percent

09:01.108 --> 09:02.307
of calories.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.609
And if you were to
eat the lowest protein

09:04.611 --> 09:06.845
foods, in the plant world,

09:06.847 --> 09:08.113
which would be foods like rice,

09:08.115 --> 09:10.048
you're at eight or
nine percent protein.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.918
So you're not going to
become protein deficient.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.086
But, the promoters of
the low-carb diets,

09:15.088 --> 09:17.122
the promoters of
the sports drinks,

09:17.124 --> 09:19.858
and the food bars, and
all these kinds of things,

09:19.860 --> 09:22.227
insist and market to
the public that they

09:22.229 --> 09:24.262
absolutely must
have more protein.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.664
It's just not true.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.799
In practical sense,
and in reality,

09:27.801 --> 09:29.668
the way we humans operate,

09:29.670 --> 09:32.037
we get ideal loads of
protein if we just get it

09:32.039 --> 09:33.738
from plants.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.641
When we consume animal foods,

09:36.643 --> 09:38.977
to get that protein,
if you will,

09:38.979 --> 09:41.746
what we're actually
doing, we're displacing,

09:41.748 --> 09:43.882
the consumption of
those foods that matter.

09:44.984 --> 09:47.719
And foods that
matter are plants.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.621
- The amount of
animal protein we eat

09:49.623 --> 09:50.822
is the problem.

09:50.824 --> 09:51.790
You know, in rural China,

09:51.792 --> 09:53.792
and Japanese populations,

09:53.794 --> 09:55.327
and healthier
places in the world,

09:55.329 --> 09:55.327
people eat a little
bit of animal protein,

09:55.329 --> 10:00.231
but for economic reasons,
it's very, very, very tiny.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.766
They use one little
piece of meat,

10:01.768 --> 10:03.835
they slice it up,
and it seasons a dish

10:03.837 --> 10:05.103
for eight people.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.072
Here in this country,
we have one gargantuan

10:07.074 --> 10:09.808
piece of meat, we
put it on a plate,

10:09.810 --> 10:11.843
with a tiny little
bit of vegetables,

10:11.845 --> 10:13.378
we call that a meal.

10:13.380 --> 10:16.848
The problem is that when
you eat too much protein,

10:16.850 --> 10:18.817
of any type, you
stress your kidneys,

10:18.819 --> 10:22.354
you stress your liver, and
when it's animal protein,

10:22.356 --> 10:24.656
you increase your
risk of cancer.

10:24.658 --> 10:27.692
And we see cancer is
geographically distributed.

10:27.694 --> 10:29.828
The more animal food
consumed in a society,

10:29.830 --> 10:32.697
the more cancer, more
heart disease, you get.

10:32.699 --> 10:34.733
- And it's amazing all
the animals that we choose

10:34.735 --> 10:38.670
in this country to eat
for protein and calcium,

10:38.672 --> 10:40.238
are vegetarian animals.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.806
Where's the logic in that?

10:41.808 --> 10:43.341
And I always like
to remind you, also,

10:43.343 --> 10:45.110
when you're eating your garbage,

10:45.112 --> 10:46.077
you never ask , "where
am I getting my protein,

10:46.079 --> 10:47.345
"and my calcium."

10:47.347 --> 10:48.813
It's only when you come
into the healthy world

10:48.815 --> 10:50.281
that all of a sudden
you're concerned

10:50.283 --> 10:51.983
with where it's coming from.

10:51.985 --> 10:55.754
- We're in the midst of
this amazing protein push.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.389
Everywhere you look,
the message is clear.

10:57.391 --> 10:58.990
Protein, protein, protein.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.725
This idea that you
need massive amounts

11:00.727 --> 11:03.928
of protein, to
simply breathe air

11:03.930 --> 11:05.063
in and out of your lungs,

11:05.065 --> 11:06.965
you know, and to be healthy,

11:06.967 --> 11:08.933
or to perform as an athlete.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.735
- Prior to making
this dietary change,

11:10.737 --> 11:14.873
like my main nutritional
strategy in a day

11:14.875 --> 11:18.143
was to see how many
grams of protein

11:18.145 --> 11:19.377
I could get in, like about that,

11:19.379 --> 11:21.312
the only calculations
i ever really did,

11:21.314 --> 11:23.181
I didn't count calories,
i didn't count anything,

11:23.183 --> 11:26.084
was just like trying to
get in exorbitant amounts

11:26.086 --> 11:28.453
of grams of protein in my day.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.188
Just because there
are grams of protein

11:30.190 --> 11:31.823
on the nutritional
content of something,

11:31.825 --> 11:33.124
doesn't mean that
your body can actually

11:33.126 --> 11:34.859
process all of those grams.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.194
- Protein does
some other things.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.862
It elevates blood
cholesterol levels,

11:37.864 --> 11:41.399
which most people
have not heard of.

11:41.401 --> 11:44.335
But that's about 100
years old, that idea.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.904
And then repeated several times,

11:45.906 --> 11:47.038
but always ignored.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.908
Animal protein
starts heart disease.

11:49.910 --> 11:52.877
It increases things
like the production

11:52.879 --> 11:54.979
of so called free radicals,

11:54.981 --> 11:57.282
which are those highly
reactive molecules

11:57.284 --> 11:59.851
that actually stimulate aging,

12:00.920 --> 12:02.821
and encourages cancer formation.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.723
It also stimulates the
production of the wrong

12:04.725 --> 12:06.157
kind of hormones.

12:06.159 --> 12:08.159
It tends to increase
the level of estrogens,

12:08.161 --> 12:10.762
for example, and
one, which in turn,

12:10.764 --> 12:12.731
is associated with
breast cancer.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.799
It changes the microflora
in our intestine

12:14.801 --> 12:17.302
when we're consuming
too much protein.

12:17.304 --> 12:18.803
I mean, it does
all these things.

12:18.805 --> 12:20.171
- There's lots of things
we have to worry about

12:20.173 --> 12:22.774
in the American diet.

12:22.776 --> 12:25.744
Fiber, 97% of Americans
don't reach the daily

12:25.746 --> 12:27.178
minimum intake of fiber,

12:27.180 --> 12:29.781
98% of Americans don't
reach the daily minimum

12:29.783 --> 12:32.050
intake of potassium,
for example.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.852
The nutrients of concern
for most Americans

12:33.854 --> 12:36.855
are the ones that are
found in plant foods.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.056
Mostly fruits and vegetables,

12:38.058 --> 12:40.458
and the ones that we're
getting too much of,

12:40.460 --> 12:43.895
in excess, whether
it's calorie, sodium,

12:43.897 --> 12:45.897
cholesterol, saturated
fat, are found

12:45.899 --> 12:48.366
in processed foods and
animal foods in general.

12:50.169 --> 12:51.970
- Many people
decide they want to improve

12:51.972 --> 12:54.873
their health, by staying
away from red meat.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.442
And instead, they begin
consuming more white meats,

12:57.444 --> 13:00.979
like chicken, Turkey, and fish.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.547
I always wondered if
certain types of meats

13:02.549 --> 13:05.350
were really better than others.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.252
- People think that
they're going to be healthy

13:07.254 --> 13:09.821
by giving up red meat,

13:09.823 --> 13:12.190
and instead, eating
poulty and fish.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.059
Stop and think about
this for a minute.

13:15.061 --> 13:18.930
What are meat, poultry and fish?

13:19.565 --> 13:21.466
They're muscles of animals.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.469
In one case, they
have to move a limb,

13:24.471 --> 13:26.538
another case, they flap a wing,

13:26.540 --> 13:28.573
in another case,
they wiggle a tail.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.809
They're the same.

13:30.811 --> 13:33.077
High fat, high protein,

13:33.079 --> 13:36.080
high cholesterol,
no dietary fiber,

13:36.082 --> 13:39.417
high in the food chain,
so heavily polluted.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.352
- From the standpoint of
the effect of the protein

13:41.354 --> 13:43.555
and fat in those foods,
and their effect on health,

13:43.557 --> 13:44.989
it really doesn't matter.

13:44.991 --> 13:48.092
It's dose dependent,
not type dependent.

13:48.094 --> 13:49.961
So fish is not
healthier, in many cases,

13:49.963 --> 13:54.065
it has more fat, than
chicken and pork.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.000
But you have other
issues with fish, too.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.569
In the ocean, you have
this whole hierarchy

13:57.571 --> 14:00.538
of things eating things, that
eat things, that eat things.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.074
And so you concentrate all
the pollutants in the ocean

14:03.076 --> 14:05.176
including Mercury,
in fish like tuna,

14:05.178 --> 14:08.046
that are some of the
favorite that we like to eat.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.547
So fish is really not healthier.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.016
Don't kid yourself in
thinking that if you're eating

14:12.018 --> 14:14.018
fish and chicken you
can eat more of it.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.120
Because one thing
in common with these

14:16.122 --> 14:17.622
healthy populations
around the world that

14:17.624 --> 14:19.624
do eat a little
bit of animal food,

14:19.626 --> 14:21.025
whatever type they're choosing,

14:21.027 --> 14:23.127
it's really a tiny,
tiny percentage

14:23.129 --> 14:25.029
of what they're
eating in their diet.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.397
So fish doesn't get a free pass.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.333
A lot of people are
being told to eat fish,

14:28.335 --> 14:31.569
by cardiologists,
or to take fish oil.

14:31.571 --> 14:32.971
That's the other thing.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.940
By cardiologists who
say that if you do that,

14:35.942 --> 14:38.643
you'll increase your
hdl cholesterol,

14:38.645 --> 14:41.212
and here's the
problem with that.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.448
It's true, by the way.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.149
It just doesn't
make any difference.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.585
Studies are pretty clear
that in populations with very

14:47.587 --> 14:50.955
low incidence of heart
disease, total cholesterol,

14:50.957 --> 14:53.958
ldl cholesterol,
and hdl cholesterol

14:53.960 --> 14:55.393
are very, very low.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.595
So that's the wrong
reason to eat fish,

14:57.597 --> 14:59.964
or take fish oil capsules,
is to increase your

14:59.966 --> 15:01.432
hdl cholesterol.

15:01.434 --> 15:04.068
Work on getting all
your cholesterol low.

15:06.038 --> 15:07.906
- Since I was a
kid, I always heard that milk

15:07.908 --> 15:10.108
was a very important food.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.176
And I consumed a lot of it.

15:12.178 --> 15:14.946
I also loved all kinds
of dairy products,

15:14.948 --> 15:17.181
cheeses, butters,
ice creams, yogurts,

15:17.183 --> 15:19.384
you name it, I had it all.

15:20.452 --> 15:22.120
It took me many years
to begin realizing

15:22.122 --> 15:25.356
that perhaps that was
not such a great idea.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.958
But I still wondered.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.359
How about calcium?

15:28.361 --> 15:30.561
Would I be able to get
enough of it from plants?

15:32.464 --> 15:34.365
- Well, we have a lot
of calcium in dairy.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.034
But it's never been a
problem to have too low

15:36.036 --> 15:37.635
calcium in a diet.

15:37.637 --> 15:40.672
- An orange has a 110
milligrams of calcium.

15:40.674 --> 15:43.041
Alright, so if you're trying
to take in 1500 milligrams

15:43.043 --> 15:45.143
a day, that doesn't
sound like so much,

15:45.145 --> 15:47.445
but when you're only
trying to get 500,

15:47.447 --> 15:49.080
it sounds pretty
good as a percentage

15:49.082 --> 15:50.548
of your daily intake.

15:50.550 --> 15:53.051
- Milk is healthy food,

15:53.053 --> 15:54.552
for calves.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.354
For baby cows.

15:56.356 --> 15:59.057
I mean, milk is for
babies, literally.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.092
I mean, we're the only
species that drinks milk

16:01.094 --> 16:04.128
of another species, and then
the only species that drinks

16:04.130 --> 16:07.532
milk after weaning
into adulthood.

16:07.534 --> 16:10.068
Why is milk associated
with increased prostate

16:10.070 --> 16:12.303
cancer risk, for example.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.105
Well, what is milk?

16:14.107 --> 16:17.141
Milk is a cocktail
of growth hormones

16:17.143 --> 16:19.177
to get a little bovine animal,

16:19.179 --> 16:23.047
who's you know, who's
susceptible to predation

16:23.049 --> 16:25.350
out on the African Savannah,

16:25.352 --> 16:27.418
to, you know, put on
a few hundred pounds

16:27.420 --> 16:29.253
in a few months, right,
because they don't

16:29.255 --> 16:31.155
want to get eaten by a lion.

16:31.157 --> 16:34.125
And so it's engineered
as this growth food

16:34.127 --> 16:36.361
for rapid growth, which is
great if you're a little

16:36.363 --> 16:40.398
baby cow, but if
you're an adult person,

16:41.700 --> 16:46.204
that extra growth hormones
is not a good thing.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.505
You know, one of the
hardest things for people

16:47.507 --> 16:49.407
to give up is dairy,
and they're sometimes

16:49.409 --> 16:52.377
really resistant to it, so
one of the things I tell

16:52.379 --> 16:54.779
people is, "well, why don't
you look at the evidence

16:54.781 --> 16:54.779
"and then decide."

16:54.781 --> 16:58.216
Because I've always said
taking control of your health,

16:58.218 --> 17:00.151
is not doing what I say
instead of what other

17:00.153 --> 17:02.086
people say, taking
control of your health is

17:02.088 --> 17:05.690
looking at the information
and making a conscious

17:05.692 --> 17:08.092
choice, about what
you want to do.

17:08.094 --> 17:10.328
- Dairy products i
describe as liquid meat.

17:11.230 --> 17:13.164
They're basically
just like red meat.

17:13.165 --> 17:16.134
High fat, high
cholesterol, no fiber,

17:16.136 --> 17:18.202
in fact, they may
be worse than meat.

17:18.204 --> 17:22.272
- The casein that they
use to bind the cheese

17:22.275 --> 17:23.741
is so full of chemicals.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.476
The chemicals are as
addictive as heroin,

17:25.478 --> 17:27.211
that we don't have four
stomachs like a baby

17:27.213 --> 17:31.215
calf, and unfortunately,
it is in everything.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.051
They put cow secretions, i
know you have other names

17:33.053 --> 17:37.221
for it, dairy, butter,
ice cream, cheese.

17:37.223 --> 17:40.625
But it's really breast
milk from a cow.

17:40.627 --> 17:41.759
- The only reason
people think we need

17:41.761 --> 17:45.430
extra calcium is
because two decades ago

17:45.432 --> 17:48.232
scientists, they raised
the bar on how much

17:48.234 --> 17:50.134
calcium we needed.

17:50.136 --> 17:53.271
That in turn was influenced
by the dairy industry.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.139
What they're really saying
is, "we're not drinking

17:55.141 --> 17:56.674
"enough milk."

17:56.676 --> 17:59.544
Because that's what the dairy
industry wants us to say.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.379
When in reality, if you
look at the relationship

18:01.381 --> 18:04.115
between how much calcium
that people consume,

18:04.117 --> 18:06.217
in different societies,
as it relates to,

18:06.219 --> 18:09.487
let's say, osteoporosis,
the bone disease,

18:09.489 --> 18:11.823
the higher the calcium intake,

18:11.825 --> 18:15.259
the higher the risk
of osteoporosis.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.360
No one wants to hear that.

18:17.396 --> 18:18.830
But that's what the datas show.

18:34.246 --> 18:36.380
- What goes on
inside an egg during incubation?

18:37.850 --> 18:41.252
Well, after a week, the
eye shows up clearly

18:41.254 --> 18:43.754
in the embryo, as the first
external organ to develop.

18:45.290 --> 18:48.559
Gestation is much further
advanced at ten days.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.261
The chick's outline
is more pronounced

18:50.263 --> 18:52.263
as other organs begin to form.

18:53.198 --> 18:55.633
At 14 days, you can see
the shape of the chick.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.235
The contents of the
egg provide nourishment

18:57.237 --> 18:59.303
during the incubation period.

19:01.340 --> 19:03.207
- Most people
can't imagine starting

19:03.209 --> 19:04.909
their day without eggs.

19:04.911 --> 19:07.778
It's the favorite breakfast
option around the world.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.780
And eggs make their
way everywhere,

19:09.782 --> 19:12.316
in breads, cakes,
candies, dressings,

19:12.318 --> 19:13.518
and even drinks.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.654
Eggs have played an important
role in our foraging

19:16.656 --> 19:19.390
ancestors creation and survival.

19:19.392 --> 19:22.326
Overall, eggs are regarded
as a healthy food,

19:22.328 --> 19:25.363
rich in protein,
minerals and fats.

19:25.365 --> 19:29.367
But in today's world, are eggs
really a good food choice?

19:29.369 --> 19:31.402
I was shocked to discover
the mounting amount

19:31.404 --> 19:34.405
of scientific evidence
showing that eggs

19:34.407 --> 19:37.308
and especially commercial
eggs might not be

19:37.310 --> 19:40.378
the healthy food that we
all once thought it to be.

19:42.314 --> 19:44.949
- Eggs are the most
concentrated source

19:44.951 --> 19:46.918
of dietary cholesterol,

19:46.920 --> 19:51.422
in the average person's diet.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.325
And dietary cholesterol
can lead to an increase

19:54.327 --> 19:56.427
in blood cholesterol
levels, which is the leading

19:56.429 --> 19:58.496
risk factor for our
number one killer

19:58.498 --> 20:00.932
of men and women, heart disease.

20:00.934 --> 20:03.968
- Eggs have kind of
the same issue as dairy

20:03.970 --> 20:07.805
in some ways, because
commercial eggs

20:07.807 --> 20:10.808
are from chickens that
are commercially raised,

20:10.810 --> 20:12.543
so, if you ever knew
how they were raised,

20:12.545 --> 20:14.779
it's horrible, you would
never go near it once.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.347
So, it's disgusting, but aside

20:16.349 --> 20:18.382
from the disgustingness
of it, commercial

20:18.384 --> 20:22.420
chickens are fed
antibiotics, to keep them

20:22.422 --> 20:24.488
bigger, it makes them
bigger, cephalosporin,

20:24.490 --> 20:26.290
to be specific.

20:26.292 --> 20:31.395
They are fed feed that's
usually corn and soy,

20:31.397 --> 20:34.298
genetically modified,
so bt toxin, corn,

20:34.300 --> 20:38.302
roundup ready corn,
roundup ready soy.

20:38.304 --> 20:40.605
So those are effecting
again the bacteria

20:40.607 --> 20:42.340
and the microbiome
of the chicken,

20:42.342 --> 20:45.376
and then, of you, because
you're ingesting it,

20:45.378 --> 20:47.278
it's bio-accumulative.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.513
A commercial chicken
leg is mostly omega 6,

20:49.515 --> 20:53.317
it's not omega 3, so it's
a horrible polyetceteric

20:53.319 --> 20:56.954
profile, and that's you know,
the least of the problems.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.589
Because, like I said,
you've got the residue

20:58.591 --> 21:02.960
from glyphosate and bt
toxin, and pesticides.

21:04.496 --> 21:05.830
- The next
nutrients on my list were

21:05.832 --> 21:07.932
omega 3 fatty acids.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.368
Who hasn't heard about
fish oil capsules?

21:10.370 --> 21:13.371
And their supposedly
great health benefits.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.439
There seems to be a
lot of controversy

21:15.441 --> 21:17.275
on this topic.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.777
I was curious to find out
how much of these fats

21:19.779 --> 21:21.746
we needed to stay healthy.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.314
And how would someone get them,

21:23.316 --> 21:25.016
if they didn't eat fish.

21:26.451 --> 21:29.287
- A lot of these silly dietary
fads become an industry.

21:29.289 --> 21:31.055
There's a lot of money to
be made, making products

21:31.057 --> 21:32.556
that cater to them,
and that sort of thing,

21:32.558 --> 21:34.859
and I'm convinced that's
the omega 3 thing.

21:34.861 --> 21:36.394
Okay, so here's the deal.

21:36.396 --> 21:38.362
There are two
essential fatty acids.

21:38.364 --> 21:39.797
Omega 3's and 6's.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.565
All the rest of them,
your body synthesizes,

21:41.567 --> 21:44.435
essential means
must come from food.

21:44.437 --> 21:46.504
Alright, so we find
omega 3 fatty acids

21:46.506 --> 21:50.074
in foods like seafood,
walnuts, flax seeds,

21:50.076 --> 21:51.809
some soy, alright.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.511
And then we find
omega 6 fatty acids

21:53.513 --> 21:57.448
in land animals, chicken, pork,

21:57.450 --> 22:00.418
beef, and polyunsaturated
vegetable oils.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.720
And so you can see
what our problem is,

22:02.722 --> 22:05.456
we eat a lot of
omega 6 fatty acids.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.825
And in fact the ratio
of omega 3 to omega 6

22:07.827 --> 22:10.928
fatty acids used to
be between one to one,

22:10.930 --> 22:12.596
and one to four.

22:12.598 --> 22:13.998
You know what it is today?

22:14.000 --> 22:17.501
Between one to twenty
five, and one to thirty.

22:17.503 --> 22:19.470
So this has led a
lot of people to say,

22:19.472 --> 22:21.939
"my gosh, this is
so out of whack.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.808
"Omega 6 is up here, and
omega 3 is down here.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.976
"Maybe what we
ought to do is take

22:25.978 --> 22:28.979
"omega 3 fatty acid
pills, fish oil pills,

22:28.981 --> 22:31.415
"and encourage fish
eating to get that

22:31.417 --> 22:33.484
"omega 3 back up to
that ratio that we have

22:33.486 --> 22:36.454
"been accustomed to
as a population."

22:36.456 --> 22:38.923
Okay, there's no
evidence that it works,

22:38.925 --> 22:40.958
in fact a large
meta-analysis that looked

22:40.960 --> 22:43.961
at 89 studies showed that it
didn't make any difference

22:43.963 --> 22:46.430
in health outcomes,
but besides that,

22:46.432 --> 22:49.567
wouldn't it be better
to lower the omega 6

22:49.569 --> 22:52.370
fatty acid in the diet,
stop eating all those

22:52.372 --> 22:53.938
land animals, stop
consuming all that

22:53.940 --> 22:58.476
plant oil, and the ratio
goes back to normal.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.845
So let's not supplement
with omega 3,

23:00.847 --> 23:03.147
let's ratchet down
omega 6, and we end up

23:03.149 --> 23:04.548
where we need to be.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.450
There's no money in
the decreasing omega 6.

23:06.452 --> 23:09.587
There's a lot of money in
selling people omega 3 pills.

23:09.589 --> 23:10.988
And getting them to eat fish.

23:10.990 --> 23:13.424
- In fact, when you take
a supplement omega 3's,

23:13.426 --> 23:15.760
we've got some really
good evidence now.

23:15.762 --> 23:17.928
Summarizing a lot of studies.

23:17.930 --> 23:21.532
The higher the use of omeg
3's, the higher is the risk

23:21.534 --> 23:23.801
for type ii diabetes.

23:23.803 --> 23:26.604
And even there's evidence
that cancer goes up, too.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.672
It does exactly the opposite
of what people think it does.

23:29.541 --> 23:30.808
It's disgusting.

23:30.810 --> 23:33.110
It's one of those
ridiculous things.

23:33.112 --> 23:35.079
- Early on, there
was data suggesting

23:35.081 --> 23:37.915
that it might be
beneficial, but now,

23:37.917 --> 23:40.151
the preponderance
of evidence is that

23:40.153 --> 23:42.720
fish oil is useless, so
there's this billion dollar

23:42.722 --> 23:45.489
industry that's
basically selling people

23:45.491 --> 23:47.825
fish oil as snake oil.

23:49.194 --> 23:51.562
- For many guys,
eating a diet rich in meat

23:51.564 --> 23:54.165
is seen as a reflection
of their manhood,

23:54.167 --> 23:56.767
and associated with
being strong and manly.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.603
I felt the same way
for most of my life.

23:59.605 --> 24:02.640
So I was really surprised
to come across studies

24:02.642 --> 24:04.775
that showed that such
a diet might actually

24:04.777 --> 24:07.645
have the contrary
effect in the long run.

24:08.847 --> 24:10.548
- Here they are eating
the meat that's going

24:10.550 --> 24:12.583
to make them macho, right?

24:12.585 --> 24:14.618
It has the opposite effect.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.655
That's not being very macho
to have erectile dysfunction.

24:17.657 --> 24:19.023
- It's all about blood
flow, they even say it

24:20.125 --> 24:22.693
in the Cialis, and
Viagra commercials.

24:22.695 --> 24:24.895
So, if your arteries
are clogged,

24:24.897 --> 24:26.831
with cheese and dairy and meat,

24:26.833 --> 24:28.933
and bacon and all this bullshit,

24:28.935 --> 24:30.768
what's the main vein?

24:30.770 --> 24:33.637
Come on, it's
simple science, man.

24:33.639 --> 24:36.774
- It's unquestionable that
men think that they have

24:36.776 --> 24:39.610
to eat a lot of
protein and that eating

24:39.612 --> 24:42.146
a plant-based diet may
not be really masculine.

24:42.148 --> 24:43.781
But I'll tell you what's
really not masculine,

24:43.783 --> 24:46.150
is erectile dysfunction.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.985
If you want to be virile,
if you want to have

24:47.987 --> 24:51.755
a great masculine life,
eat a plant-based diet.

24:51.757 --> 24:54.058
There is a great deal of
evidence that erectile

24:54.060 --> 24:58.062
dysfunction is caused by
diet in many instances.

24:58.064 --> 25:01.532
And the reason is, that if
you have coronary artery

25:01.534 --> 25:04.134
disease, in one
area of the body,

25:04.136 --> 25:04.869
you have it everywhere.

25:05.937 --> 25:07.171
So those very tiny blood vessels

25:07.173 --> 25:09.240
that lead to the penis,
are some of the first

25:09.242 --> 25:11.909
to get effected, and
so erectile dysfunction

25:11.911 --> 25:13.777
has been referred
to as the canary

25:13.779 --> 25:15.246
in the coal mine.

25:15.248 --> 25:18.249
It's the sign that
something is terribly wrong,

25:18.251 --> 25:20.951
and you need to fix
it, and at that stage,

25:20.953 --> 25:23.521
it's much more fixable
than if you've already

25:23.523 --> 25:24.855
had the heart attack,
or the stroke,

25:24.857 --> 25:27.024
or something really
serious happen.

25:33.765 --> 25:35.032
- Obesity
is linked to more

25:35.034 --> 25:37.601
than 60 chronic diseases,

25:37.603 --> 25:39.703
and it is common knowledge
that there is an epidemic

25:39.705 --> 25:42.006
of obesity around the world.

25:42.008 --> 25:44.174
Today, two thirds of
adults, and nearly one third

25:44.176 --> 25:47.578
of children in America
struggle with it.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.747
It seems like in
the last 30 years,

25:49.749 --> 25:51.682
human waist lines
have simply grown

25:51.684 --> 25:52.950
out of proportion.

25:52.952 --> 25:55.719
And if obesity rates
stay consistent,

25:55.721 --> 25:59.256
by 2030, 51% of the
American population

25:59.258 --> 26:01.225
could potentially be obese.

26:03.295 --> 26:06.697
- As far as dieting,
or losing weight,

26:06.699 --> 26:09.233
people take two
approaches that don't work

26:09.235 --> 26:09.233
for the long term.

26:09.235 --> 26:12.937
And so of course they
say diets don't work.

26:12.939 --> 26:15.839
One approach is they try
and starve themselves,

26:15.841 --> 26:17.341
and be hungry all the time.

26:17.343 --> 26:19.710
These are portion controlled
diets, typical diets

26:19.712 --> 26:21.111
that people follow.

26:21.113 --> 26:22.746
They don't work because
you're hungry all the time,

26:22.748 --> 26:25.716
you can't tolerate
that kind of pain.

26:25.718 --> 26:28.886
The alternative is the
make yourself sick diets.

26:28.888 --> 26:33.157
And those are the high
protein, high fat,

26:33.159 --> 26:34.959
low carbohydrate diets.

26:36.027 --> 26:37.728
- Over
the last few decades,

26:37.730 --> 26:39.730
there has been an explosion
of commercial diets

26:39.732 --> 26:41.732
in the U.S.

26:41.734 --> 26:43.200
Most of them revolving
around the idea

26:43.202 --> 26:46.670
that eating few carbs,
and lots of animal protein

26:46.672 --> 26:48.839
helps with weight loss,

26:48.841 --> 26:51.075
all orchestrated by
multi-million dollar,

26:51.077 --> 26:53.110
ingenious advertising campaigns

26:53.112 --> 26:55.145
and celebrity endorsements.

26:56.281 --> 26:59.116
As a result, nowadays,
most people associate

26:59.118 --> 27:01.385
carbs with weight gain.

27:01.387 --> 27:04.888
For many years, I worked
really hard to cut my carbs,

27:04.890 --> 27:07.791
without any long term
results, and without fully

27:07.793 --> 27:09.860
understanding why
i was doing it.

27:10.929 --> 27:13.163
I wanted to find out
what the latest science

27:13.165 --> 27:15.733
had to say about
these low carb diets.

27:17.235 --> 27:19.937
- Rob atkins, some
years ago, in 1973,

27:19.939 --> 27:22.706
published his first book,

27:22.708 --> 27:25.109
in which he argued that
it's not the problem

27:25.111 --> 27:28.812
with the fat, it's not the
problem with the protein,

27:28.814 --> 27:30.748
but mostly fat, he said
that's not the problem,

27:30.750 --> 27:33.083
the problem is we consume
too much carbohydrate.

27:33.085 --> 27:35.052
And he made that point,
we should be consuming

27:35.054 --> 27:36.920
low carb diet, he said.

27:36.922 --> 27:39.790
And then many other people
wrote the same thing.

27:39.792 --> 27:42.960
The south beach diet,
is only a copycat,

27:42.962 --> 27:45.696
for the most part,
of the atkins diet.

27:45.698 --> 27:48.932
The zone diet is basically
a copycat, different name.

27:48.934 --> 27:52.403
The blood type diet in many
regards is also a copycat.

27:52.405 --> 27:55.773
Good calories bad calories,
dairy 12, same thing.

27:55.775 --> 27:59.009
Even Marco paleo, and I have
to say, omnivore's dilemma.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.778
And the paleo diet
in this day and time

28:01.413 --> 28:02.713
is a copycat.

28:03.381 --> 28:03.380
They may give it
different names,

28:03.382 --> 28:07.351
they may try to throw out
you know, different types

28:07.353 --> 28:08.152
of arguments for
why that's right,

28:08.154 --> 28:09.420
they're all wrong.

28:09.422 --> 28:10.888
- Everybody wants
to hear good news

28:10.890 --> 28:12.222
about their bad habits.

28:12.224 --> 28:14.324
So when you tell
people you can eat all

28:14.326 --> 28:17.227
the lobster you want,
you can have steak,

28:17.229 --> 28:19.897
and eggs, and you know,
some include dairy,

28:19.899 --> 28:23.067
some don't include dairy,
but that's sounds good

28:23.069 --> 28:25.903
to people, because it
sounds less restrictive.

28:25.905 --> 28:27.237
- This is written by
people, I should tell you,

28:27.239 --> 28:29.840
who don't have
experience in this field

28:29.842 --> 28:32.309
of nutrition research, period.

28:32.311 --> 28:33.844
Most of them have
never even published

28:33.846 --> 28:36.380
a single paper into
scientific literature.

28:36.382 --> 28:37.815
- Some of the people
who are talking

28:37.817 --> 28:39.817
about low carb diets
are little better than

28:39.819 --> 28:43.153
news reporters, and that's
not to take anything away

28:43.155 --> 28:45.823
from their skill at
investigating things,
but they cannot

28:45.825 --> 28:49.860
don't have the skills to
evaluate scientific information.

28:49.862 --> 28:52.763
- Low carb diets,
they make you sick.

28:52.765 --> 28:55.132
And as a result, your
whole body gets sick,

28:55.134 --> 28:56.967
with artery disease,
and kidney damage,

28:56.969 --> 28:58.402
liver damage and so on.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.170
They increase mortality,
that's been shown

29:00.172 --> 29:03.107
over and over again
in major studies.

29:03.109 --> 29:04.842
But they also make
you sick in a way

29:04.844 --> 29:06.910
that you lose your appetite.

29:06.912 --> 29:09.213
The dieter goes, "oh,
I've finally found it."

29:09.215 --> 29:11.048
And then you go into
ketosis, you lost your

29:11.050 --> 29:14.084
appetite, as a result,
you're able to sustain

29:14.086 --> 29:16.920
yourself without thinking
about food all the time.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.288
Because you're sick.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.891
These diets are dangerous,

29:20.893 --> 29:22.926
and people should
not be on them.

29:22.928 --> 29:24.294
- Well, you know, the
biggest lies in the world

29:24.296 --> 29:27.097
are the ones that
have a little truth.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.132
We all know that.

29:28.134 --> 29:29.900
It's a great tactic.

29:29.902 --> 29:32.369
It's true, I happen to agree,
that we should cut down

29:32.371 --> 29:34.371
on simple carbohydrates.

29:35.507 --> 29:37.808
You see, that's out of
context to the whole.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.510
You know, sugar, white flour.

29:39.512 --> 29:40.978
That makes sense.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.513
So in that sense,
there's a little truth.

29:43.548 --> 29:45.983
But they don't always
point that out.

29:45.985 --> 29:48.285
They just say, low carb,
low carb, low carb.

29:48.287 --> 29:51.021
- Listen, forget about
what you like and dislike,

29:51.023 --> 29:53.323
think about what
your objective is.

29:53.325 --> 29:55.559
Alright, let's just
acknowledge we all like eating

29:55.561 --> 29:55.559
junk food.

29:55.561 --> 29:55.559
If you put chocolate in front
of me today, I'll have some,

29:55.561 --> 30:01.064
right, but that
doesn't lead to health.

30:02.867 --> 30:04.368
- I personally
knew several people

30:04.370 --> 30:06.904
who experienced amazing
healing and health

30:06.906 --> 30:08.872
benefits after
adopting some kind

30:08.874 --> 30:12.376
some kind of a plant-based
diet, including myself.

30:12.378 --> 30:15.579
But at the same time,
i had also met others

30:15.581 --> 30:18.081
who are still experiencing
health issues,

30:18.083 --> 30:20.083
or were struggling
with their weight,

30:20.085 --> 30:24.054
after adopting this lifestyle,
some for many years.

30:24.056 --> 30:25.556
So it made me wonder.

30:25.558 --> 30:27.090
Was there a flaw in this diet?

30:28.560 --> 30:31.461
- First vegetarian
that I knew well

30:31.463 --> 30:34.498
about 40 years ago,
was actually a vegan

30:34.500 --> 30:36.867
he was a very strict vegetarian,

30:36.869 --> 30:40.003
he lived on Coca cola
and potato chips.

30:40.005 --> 30:42.606
He was fat, greasy,
and unhealthy.

30:42.608 --> 30:45.909
So being a vegetarian
means really nothing to me.

30:45.911 --> 30:48.979
- 90% of the vegetarians
are still consuming dairy.

30:48.981 --> 30:50.247
90%.

30:50.249 --> 30:52.316
And they also consume
sometimes some fish,

30:52.318 --> 30:55.552
and sometimes some chicken,
and eggs, and so forth.

30:55.554 --> 30:57.221
The nutrient composition
of the vegetarian diet

30:57.223 --> 31:01.091
is not very different
from the non-vegetarian.

31:02.193 --> 31:04.561
So, as a result, if you compare
the health of vegetarians,

31:04.563 --> 31:07.130
with non-vegetarians, you
can't expect to see very much.

31:07.132 --> 31:09.266
- But somebody's decided
they're going to be vegan,

31:09.268 --> 31:11.535
in other words eat no
animal foods, they've made

31:11.537 --> 31:15.272
a declaration as to
their physical and mental

31:15.274 --> 31:18.275
strength, and their interest,
and their willingness

31:18.277 --> 31:19.443
to work hard.

31:19.445 --> 31:21.979
After all, if you become vegan,

31:21.981 --> 31:24.648
you have to stand up
to your mother-in-law,

31:24.650 --> 31:26.650
and your doctor or your
dietitian, you have to,

31:26.652 --> 31:29.586
quote, risk protein
and calcium deficiency,

31:29.588 --> 31:31.221
even though that's not true.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.090
But the problem is
that too many vegans

31:33.892 --> 31:35.158
they don't look good.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.261
They're overweight,
they're unhealthy looking.

31:37.263 --> 31:39.096
- I don't really like
to use the words vegan

31:39.098 --> 31:41.164
and vegetarian because,

31:42.500 --> 31:44.001
that's not describing
the kind of science

31:44.003 --> 31:45.269
I'm talking about.

31:45.271 --> 31:47.304
- I would call myself a
fat vegan when I first

31:47.306 --> 31:49.573
started out, that's
exactly what I was, and I

31:49.575 --> 31:51.508
was trying to tell
everyone how great this

31:51.510 --> 31:54.111
lifestyle is, and it
saved me, and it reversed

31:54.113 --> 31:55.479
my heart disease.

31:55.481 --> 31:58.548
But yet, I was still walking
around, about 75 pounds

31:58.550 --> 32:00.918
to a hundred pounds overweight.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.352
- Now why is
somebody a fat vegan?

32:03.454 --> 32:06.356
Not because they give
up the animal foods.

32:06.358 --> 32:09.092
That's a good thing, you need
to give up the animal foods.

32:09.094 --> 32:12.029
But what they haven't
given up is the oil.

32:12.031 --> 32:14.231
The olive oil, the
other vegetable oils,

32:14.233 --> 32:18.335
the fat you eat is the
fat you wear, whether

32:18.337 --> 32:20.570
it comes from a
plant, or an animal.

32:20.572 --> 32:22.439
- So, I made the change.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.541
I removed the foods
in my diet that were

32:24.543 --> 32:28.078
empty calories, the
oils and the fats,

32:28.080 --> 32:31.081
the sugars, the processed foods,

32:31.083 --> 32:32.582
the food additives
that kept me coming

32:32.584 --> 32:34.985
back for more, those
companies add those

32:34.987 --> 32:38.055
things purposely to
get us to not eat

32:38.057 --> 32:40.057
just one potato chip.

32:40.059 --> 32:41.591
We need the whole bag.

32:41.593 --> 32:43.961
There's millions of overweight
people in this country,

32:43.963 --> 32:45.662
and they're all struggling,
trying this diet,

32:45.664 --> 32:47.631
or that diet, and they
try this diet for a week,

32:47.633 --> 32:49.599
or that diet for a week,
and they're spending

32:49.601 --> 32:52.602
a lot of money on all these
different diet programs,

32:52.604 --> 32:56.173
and pills, and supplements,
and adding things

32:56.175 --> 32:59.609
to their diet to lose
weight, or to get healthy,

32:59.611 --> 33:02.679
and that's where we need to
realize that a whole foods

33:02.681 --> 33:05.549
plant-based diet is
free, there's no shakes,

33:05.551 --> 33:07.551
there's no bars,
there's no powders,

33:07.553 --> 33:09.653
there's no counting
calories, we eat until

33:09.655 --> 33:12.556
we're full and
satisfied, and stop.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.358
And that's it.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.226
- As much as
i liked the idea of eating

33:16.228 --> 33:18.628
exclusively a plant-based diet,

33:18.630 --> 33:21.164
especially since it
had worked for me,

33:21.166 --> 33:23.033
I wanted this film
to be very accurate

33:23.035 --> 33:25.669
with the latest science on food.

33:25.671 --> 33:28.038
So I wondered, if realistically,

33:28.040 --> 33:30.173
from a scientific perspective,

33:30.175 --> 33:31.575
could every person
in this day and age

33:31.577 --> 33:36.346
eat a plant-based
diet 100% of the time?

33:36.348 --> 33:38.682
- I can't say, and I don't
thing science can say,

33:38.684 --> 33:41.251
that everybody has to be 100%.

33:42.153 --> 33:42.152
You know, all the time.

33:42.154 --> 33:46.490
I can argue the case, i
think, for the vast majority

33:46.492 --> 33:50.093
of people, we ought
to be at least 90,

33:50.095 --> 33:52.429
probably 95%, we've got
good science for that.

33:52.431 --> 33:54.197
And in many cases, if
people already have

33:54.199 --> 33:55.799
a disease, it's a good idea

33:55.801 --> 33:58.201
they should be
100% all the time.

33:58.203 --> 34:00.737
So that's my
scientific argument.

34:00.739 --> 34:02.339
I have another practical
argument, though

34:02.341 --> 34:05.108
on this question, concerning
how far do you go.

34:05.110 --> 34:08.545
And that is that if
we're going to adopt

34:08.547 --> 34:10.179
this dietary lifestyle,

34:12.050 --> 34:15.284
it's really important that
we become accustomed to it.

34:15.286 --> 34:18.255
And we should go
probably 100% if we can.

34:18.257 --> 34:18.255
And stay there.

34:18.257 --> 34:22.192
And don't tease ourselves
with the other things.

34:22.194 --> 34:24.561
Because what happens, we
never become accustomed

34:24.563 --> 34:27.664
to this, where our taste
preferences change.

34:27.666 --> 34:30.266
- If you do it right,
there are no health issues.

34:30.268 --> 34:32.202
In fact, the side effects are
you're going to lose weight,

34:32.204 --> 34:33.703
you're going to look
better, you're going to have

34:33.705 --> 34:36.273
more energy, you're going
to avoid most of the common

34:36.275 --> 34:39.242
degenerative conditions,
most of the time,

34:39.244 --> 34:41.210
you're going to have a
longer life, and a healthier,

34:41.213 --> 34:43.246
and a better life.

34:43.248 --> 34:44.281
You know, that's
about what happens

34:44.283 --> 34:45.215
when you do this.

34:45.217 --> 34:46.716
So there isn't a downside.

34:48.485 --> 34:50.786
- We often hear
that the key to good health

34:50.789 --> 34:53.556
is moderation, and
it makes sense.

34:54.659 --> 34:56.193
But why then does
it not seem to work

34:56.195 --> 34:57.494
for most people?

35:05.436 --> 35:06.670
- You know for some people,

35:06.672 --> 35:08.138
that's a really
easy thing to do.

35:08.140 --> 35:09.739
But unfortunately for most,

35:09.741 --> 35:13.210
finding moderation is
like finding a needle

35:13.212 --> 35:14.344
in a haystack.

35:14.346 --> 35:16.246
And, because others can do it,

35:16.248 --> 35:19.549
they feel lost, and they
feel like an absolute

35:19.551 --> 35:21.284
failure because they can't.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.820
And the truth be
told, most people

35:23.822 --> 35:26.223
can't find moderation,
so they're actually

35:26.225 --> 35:28.458
in the majority and
not the minority.

35:28.460 --> 35:32.262
But this minority few
that are on television,

35:32.264 --> 35:34.898
that have never, ever been fat,

35:34.900 --> 35:36.466
never, ever been sick,

35:36.468 --> 35:39.369
have genetics very
much on their way,

35:39.371 --> 35:40.904
they're out there saying,
"it's all about this,

35:40.906 --> 35:42.372
"and all about that."

35:42.374 --> 35:44.207
I mean, how are
they going to relate

35:44.209 --> 35:46.743
to that poor person
sitting at home,

35:46.745 --> 35:48.678
that's 350 pounds,
that feels like their

35:48.680 --> 35:50.447
world is over?

35:50.449 --> 35:52.349
Now, I know what they feel like.

35:52.351 --> 35:54.584
I was 310 pounds.

35:54.586 --> 35:57.220
I was loaded up on
medication for eight years.

35:57.222 --> 35:59.156
I understand, I can relate.

35:59.158 --> 36:00.790
I won't tell anybody
that moderation's easy.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.726
Moderation's damn hard.

36:02.728 --> 36:04.361
Really hard.

36:04.363 --> 36:05.896
I still haven't mastered it.

36:05.898 --> 36:08.365
I'm a work in progress when
it comes to moderation.

36:08.367 --> 36:11.368
But what I'm finding
is that I'm away

36:11.370 --> 36:12.702
from an extreme now,

36:14.205 --> 36:16.840
of 93% of my energy
coming from this processed

36:16.842 --> 36:18.575
and fun part of
town, animal fat,

36:18.577 --> 36:20.810
I've now got this moderation up,

36:20.812 --> 36:23.613
I've now moved it
up, and it's working.

36:26.517 --> 36:28.285
- So how are
people supposed to get

36:28.287 --> 36:30.220
all this information?

36:30.222 --> 36:32.355
Since everyday we're
bombarded with TV ads,

36:32.357 --> 36:36.326
infomercials, news talking
about the new food trends.

36:36.328 --> 36:38.495
How can we know who's
telling the truth,

36:38.497 --> 36:40.397
and has honest and
unbiased science

36:40.399 --> 36:41.631
behind their products?

36:43.434 --> 36:45.835
- The media always approaches
things with the idea

36:45.837 --> 36:48.572
that if we're going
to interview somebody

36:48.574 --> 36:50.640
about diet, we have to let
somebody with a different

36:50.642 --> 36:53.376
opinion give their opinion.

36:53.378 --> 36:54.945
Alright, so here's what happens.

36:54.947 --> 36:56.846
Someone like Colin Campbell,
at Cornell university

36:56.848 --> 36:59.282
writes this book,
the China study.

36:59.284 --> 36:59.282
It has hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds

36:59.284 --> 37:04.321
of references, it
represents decades of very

37:04.323 --> 37:07.624
meticulous research,
work that he did, right?

37:07.626 --> 37:09.292
And so they're going to
interview him, well then

37:09.294 --> 37:11.394
they go find somebody that's
promoting a paleo diet,

37:11.396 --> 37:13.363
or a low carb diet
because we have to have

37:13.365 --> 37:14.664
the contrary opinion.

37:14.666 --> 37:16.433
That person may have
written a terrible book,

37:16.435 --> 37:17.734
that's a little more
than a storybook,

37:17.736 --> 37:20.570
it's not referenced,
it has no credibility,

37:20.572 --> 37:22.906
but in the eyes of the
public, now those two

37:22.908 --> 37:25.508
are equal, Colin has an opinion,

37:25.510 --> 37:27.510
and this other person
has an opinion.

37:28.679 --> 37:29.679
So it confuses people, and
it gains traction that way.

37:31.315 --> 37:34.451
- We tend to look
at the fast food industry

37:34.453 --> 37:37.254
as the big villain,
responsible for all the havoc

37:37.256 --> 37:38.688
surrounding food choices.

37:39.790 --> 37:41.458
But these same companies
that are contributing

37:41.460 --> 37:44.327
to the problem may
also hold the key

37:44.329 --> 37:45.962
to the solution.

37:45.964 --> 37:48.031
It is a supply and demand issue,

37:48.033 --> 37:50.867
so if enough people
begin demanding healthy,

37:50.869 --> 37:54.804
plant-based options, perhaps
that could be a good approach.

37:54.806 --> 37:57.574
After all, it is us the
consumers who should dictate

37:57.576 --> 37:59.909
what the market has to offer.

37:59.911 --> 38:01.511
And not the other way around.

38:02.913 --> 38:06.483
- You can make better,
cleaner, healthier products

38:06.485 --> 38:08.818
by incorporating more
plant-based foods

38:08.820 --> 38:11.888
into your products, and
not to shy away from that.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.790
So, I don't take a
negative approach like down

38:13.792 --> 38:16.393
with these fast foods.

38:16.395 --> 38:18.728
We need to make them understand

38:18.730 --> 38:20.530
that they can still
make money, and they

38:20.532 --> 38:22.499
can still have a
sustainable business,

38:22.501 --> 38:24.067
because there are
people out there

38:24.069 --> 38:25.535
that want this food.

38:25.537 --> 38:27.737
We just have to make
it available to them.

38:37.448 --> 38:38.648
- Most people
rely on their doctors

38:38.650 --> 38:41.718
for information about
diet and nutrition.

38:41.720 --> 38:43.753
But several medical
school programs

38:43.755 --> 38:48.325
show that doctors get very
little training on nutrition.

38:48.327 --> 38:50.026
Sometimes, none at all.

38:51.929 --> 38:53.463
- As I went through
medical school,

38:53.465 --> 38:55.865
and I went through
residency, and I started

38:57.001 --> 39:00.470
after that, working on
my own as a physician,

39:00.472 --> 39:04.341
after awhile, I became kind
of a little bit frustrated

39:04.343 --> 39:06.509
with my inability to
really, really help people.

39:06.511 --> 39:07.944
Because what i
thought was happening,

39:07.946 --> 39:11.548
was that, I was just
basically seeing patients,

39:11.550 --> 39:13.683
asked to see them very quickly,

39:13.685 --> 39:15.452
and was really left
with limited options

39:15.454 --> 39:17.120
as far as what I could do.

39:17.122 --> 39:19.556
I really felt what i
needed to do with the time

39:19.558 --> 39:22.492
that I had, was left to
do, was just basically

39:22.494 --> 39:26.096
treat symptoms, instead of
trying to get to the root cause

39:26.098 --> 39:27.931
of the problem, or the root
cause of their disease.

39:27.933 --> 39:30.567
So, it left me basically
practicing I think the kind

39:30.569 --> 39:33.470
of medicine that the
majority of people are

39:33.472 --> 39:36.573
practicing in the U.S.,
which is pharmaceutical based

39:36.575 --> 39:39.476
medicine, and I don't have
a problem with medication.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.044
I think medications are
wonderful, medications

39:41.046 --> 39:44.547
are great, they're necessary
for a lot of people,

39:44.549 --> 39:45.982
they are really the only option.

39:45.984 --> 39:48.485
For many people
they're a good option.

39:48.487 --> 39:50.587
But I think what we're
missing is that there's

39:50.589 --> 39:52.489
something else that's out there.

39:53.691 --> 39:56.726
- I was outsourcing my
health, to somebody else.

39:56.728 --> 39:58.561
I was coming along saying,
"here's some money,

39:58.563 --> 40:01.097
"will you fix me,
I'm busy over here."

40:01.099 --> 40:02.565
And when are you
going to come up

40:02.567 --> 40:04.100
with a drug that's
going to like, cure me?

40:05.169 --> 40:08.004
- By using more
chemicals to correct

40:08.006 --> 40:10.173
the imbalance, we're
actually causing

40:10.175 --> 40:13.476
the imbalances to
be even stronger.

40:13.478 --> 40:16.513
I found that people
who've been on medications

40:16.515 --> 40:20.583
for a long time, are developing
a lot of side effects

40:20.585 --> 40:22.585
from those medications,
where then are causing

40:22.587 --> 40:26.956
other organs in their
bodies to become diseased,

40:28.159 --> 40:31.161
their functioning is
weakening, their overall health

40:31.163 --> 40:33.596
is weakening, their
immune system is getting

40:33.598 --> 40:35.698
deficient, if
something is destroying

40:35.700 --> 40:39.035
you really need to infuse
that with something

40:39.037 --> 40:41.438
that's going help rebuild it.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.206
- So, if somebody
comes along and says,

40:43.208 --> 40:46.743
"you know, doctor, I can take
this patient, and by doing

40:46.745 --> 40:49.612
"these simple things, you
know changing their diet,

40:49.614 --> 40:52.215
"getting them to eat a
little bit differently,

40:52.217 --> 40:53.883
"more plant-based,
getting them to exercise

40:53.885 --> 40:56.085
"a little more, do you
realize that I could make

40:56.087 --> 40:58.555
"this diabetes
essentially, if you were

40:58.557 --> 41:01.024
"to test them again,
virtually go away?"

41:01.026 --> 41:02.625
And a lot of doctors
in this country,

41:02.627 --> 41:04.494
some may be familiar
with the idea,

41:04.496 --> 41:05.929
but a lot of them,
even to this day,

41:05.931 --> 41:08.198
would still say, "no,
you know, I don't think

41:08.200 --> 41:08.198
"that would be possible."

41:08.200 --> 41:11.601
- The cause of most of
our diseases and the cure

41:11.603 --> 41:15.872
is within anybody's reach
who gets the knowledge.

41:15.874 --> 41:18.908
The problem is, is they
have to make some change.

41:18.910 --> 41:20.243
That's a small problem.

41:20.245 --> 41:23.046
The real problem is
there is no money

41:23.048 --> 41:25.014
in doing the right thing.

41:25.016 --> 41:26.749
There's money in
selling you statins,

41:26.751 --> 41:30.153
and blood pressure pills,
and powerful arthritis drugs,

41:30.155 --> 41:35.225
and laxatives, and antacids,
that's where the money is.

41:36.494 --> 41:37.227
So that's where
the education goes.

41:37.229 --> 41:39.195
- We have to shift the dollars,

41:39.197 --> 41:42.532
from expensive procedures,

41:42.534 --> 41:46.002
and shift it more
towards education,

41:46.004 --> 41:48.271
teaching people, showing
them about their disease,

41:48.273 --> 41:51.908
and why it's there, and
teaching them the things

41:51.910 --> 41:53.610
that they can do
day in and day out

41:53.612 --> 41:56.713
that would positively
impact that disease,

41:56.715 --> 41:59.582
and possibly even get
it certainly improved,

41:59.584 --> 42:01.150
and maybe even
reversed in some cases.

42:01.152 --> 42:04.954
- You can expect artery disease,
to stabilize and reverse,

42:04.956 --> 42:06.756
and the symptoms to go away,

42:06.758 --> 42:08.858
you can expect the type ii
diabetes, if it's really

42:08.860 --> 42:12.862
type ii diabetes, to be
cured 100% of the time

42:12.864 --> 42:15.532
with diet change and
associated weight loss.

42:15.534 --> 42:17.867
You can expect the
arthritis' to improve,

42:17.869 --> 42:19.869
and go away and be
cured, many times,

42:19.871 --> 42:21.671
with your inflammatory
arthritis'.

42:21.673 --> 42:24.307
The bowel problems, all
the way from indigestion,

42:24.309 --> 42:27.010
to constipation, to
colitus, you can expect

42:27.012 --> 42:30.647
to cure when you direct
your attention to the cause

42:30.649 --> 42:32.749
of the problem and you fix it.

42:40.124 --> 42:41.691
- On the
supplement aisle is where

42:41.693 --> 42:43.326
things get really crazy.

42:43.328 --> 42:45.828
It seems like every product
can improve our health,

42:45.830 --> 42:47.730
in one way or another.

42:47.732 --> 42:50.099
Some support each of
our different organs,

42:50.101 --> 42:54.137
others give us energy,
stimulate our immune system,

42:54.139 --> 42:58.041
prevent colds, reduce appetite,
or promote weight loss.

42:58.876 --> 43:00.710
It makes me really confused.

43:00.712 --> 43:03.179
If they're all so good for
us, should we even have

43:03.181 --> 43:05.181
to worry about eating healthy?

43:06.650 --> 43:09.118
- Too
tired, too often?

43:09.120 --> 43:10.853
Try rybutol.

43:10.855 --> 43:12.755
If you, too, need extra
amounts of thiamine

43:12.757 --> 43:15.258
and riboflavin, rybutol
can help you gain

43:15.260 --> 43:17.760
new strength, new energy

43:17.762 --> 43:19.696
let just one person
among thousands of users

43:19.698 --> 43:24.067
tell you about amazing
benefits gained from rybutol.

43:24.069 --> 43:25.768
- There's some products
out there that could

43:25.770 --> 43:27.704
be beneficial to our health,

43:27.706 --> 43:29.105
and there's nothing
wrong with them,

43:29.107 --> 43:30.773
but I think the problem
comes when people

43:30.775 --> 43:33.910
overdo or overuse
that one product,

43:33.912 --> 43:36.379
and look at is as you
know, the silver bullet,

43:36.381 --> 43:39.182
the thing that's going
to cure all my ills.

43:39.184 --> 43:41.718
When people go to that extreme,

43:41.720 --> 43:44.320
I don't think there's a
product out there like that.

43:44.322 --> 43:46.189
- I discourage supplements,

43:46.191 --> 43:47.390
most of the time.

43:47.392 --> 43:48.758
For most people.

43:48.760 --> 43:50.693
And part of the problem
with supplements

43:50.695 --> 43:54.764
is that supplements,
drugs, procedures,

43:54.766 --> 43:59.068
they all have application
for specific populations.

43:59.070 --> 44:00.937
So, the whole pitch,
if you will, is based

44:00.939 --> 44:04.273
on the idea that you can't
get enough nutrients,

44:04.275 --> 44:06.376
from food, you don't
eat the right diet,

44:06.378 --> 44:09.045
so you can somehow,
make up for it,

44:09.047 --> 44:10.747
by taking these
dietary supplements.

44:10.749 --> 44:12.749
So it's become a 40
billion dollar industry.

44:12.751 --> 44:15.385
The sales pitches worked,
people are doing it.

44:15.387 --> 44:16.786
They're buying this stuff.

44:16.788 --> 44:18.154
And the people who sell
it, they're hanging

44:18.156 --> 44:19.956
on for dear life, and
they're not about to give

44:19.958 --> 44:22.725
into the scientific truth.

44:22.727 --> 44:25.028
But the reality is that
all of the nutrients

44:25.030 --> 44:28.064
that you need are in
food, and they're in food

44:28.066 --> 44:31.034
- in very specific and
complex combinations

44:31.036 --> 44:33.703
that we don't really
even understand

44:33.705 --> 44:35.004
all of yet.

44:35.006 --> 44:37.106
And so when you extract
a single nutrient

44:37.108 --> 44:39.776
and purify it, and
put it in a pill,

44:39.778 --> 44:41.944
you're overloading your
system with something

44:41.946 --> 44:44.080
that it's never seen
before, and is really not

44:44.082 --> 44:46.716
adapted to deal with.

44:46.718 --> 44:48.284
Much better to eat
smaller amounts of it,

44:48.286 --> 44:50.987
in the food, and again,
I'll Grant that there

44:50.989 --> 44:52.922
are exceptions,
and in my office,

44:52.924 --> 44:54.991
I recommend
supplements sometimes,

44:54.993 --> 44:57.927
but not to the
general population.

44:57.929 --> 44:59.762
And that's the problem
in medicine, too,

44:59.764 --> 45:01.230
we want to take
everything, and sell it

45:01.232 --> 45:03.800
to everybody, because
that's how you make money.

45:03.802 --> 45:06.769
- A lot of people have
done a lot of disservice

45:06.771 --> 45:08.438
to many, many people,

45:08.440 --> 45:11.140
trying to offer them a
magic pill, or a magic this,

45:11.142 --> 45:13.743
or a solution in five days,

45:13.745 --> 45:15.845
that's going to
change your life.

45:15.847 --> 45:19.282
And the simple reality
is, is that you can't do

45:19.284 --> 45:24.353
20 years of damage, by
ignoring mother nature's best,

45:25.823 --> 45:26.756
the fruits, the vegetables,
the nuts, the beans,

45:26.758 --> 45:27.924
the seeds.

45:27.926 --> 45:31.794
You can't spend 20
years saying no to that,

45:31.796 --> 45:35.164
and then expect
people in white coats

45:35.166 --> 45:37.066
to come up with
something that's going

45:37.068 --> 45:38.868
to solve that, in five days.

45:39.970 --> 45:42.438
So what we have to
do is we have to see

45:42.440 --> 45:45.842
the error of our ways,
which was turning our back

45:45.844 --> 45:47.744
on mother nature,
and we have to turn

45:47.746 --> 45:50.146
towards her, for a solution.

45:51.181 --> 45:53.282
- Vitamin supplements
for example,

45:53.284 --> 45:55.118
we've got a lot of data
that, when you take them

45:55.120 --> 45:58.221
out of context, like that,
and use them that way,

45:58.223 --> 46:00.890
in the short run, yeah, it
looks sort of interesting,

46:00.892 --> 46:03.259
maybe they're looking
good for a little while,

46:03.261 --> 46:05.161
especially in people
that may be really low

46:05.163 --> 46:08.798
on them, but in
the long run, no.

46:08.800 --> 46:10.900
You know, they don't work

46:10.902 --> 46:14.036
and yet we're spending
32 billion dollars a year

46:14.038 --> 46:15.905
on nutrient supplements.

46:15.907 --> 46:18.541
- The most important
supplement for those

46:18.543 --> 46:21.944
eating plant-based diets, is

46:21.946 --> 46:24.213
a vitamin b12, a
regular reliable source

46:24.215 --> 46:26.382
of vitamin b12, it doesn't
have to be supplements,

46:26.384 --> 46:28.451
but they have b12
fortified foods.

46:28.453 --> 46:31.854
This is very important,
it's critical

46:31.856 --> 46:33.856
for everyone eating
a plant-based diet

46:33.858 --> 46:36.893
to get a regular reliable
source of vitamin b12.

46:36.895 --> 46:39.962
There's only two vitamins
not created by plants.

46:39.964 --> 46:42.231
One is vitamin d,
created by animals,

46:42.233 --> 46:44.901
such as yourself when you
walk out into the sun,

46:46.036 --> 46:47.904
and the other is vitamin
b12, not made by plants,

46:47.906 --> 46:49.906
not made by animals either,
it's made by little microbes

46:49.908 --> 46:52.875
that blanket the
earth, so, you know,

46:52.877 --> 46:54.243
it might've gotten enough

46:54.245 --> 46:56.979
from drinking out of a
mountain stream, or well water,

46:56.981 --> 46:59.081
but now we chlorinate
the water supply to kill

46:59.083 --> 47:02.018
off any bacteria, so we
don't get a lot of you know,

47:02.020 --> 47:04.320
b12 in our water anymore,
don't get alot of cholera

47:04.322 --> 47:06.923
either, that's a good thing.

47:06.925 --> 47:08.925
But because of the way we live

47:08.927 --> 47:12.328
you know, in our, you know
sanitized, modern world,

47:12.330 --> 47:14.497
got to get b12 from somewhere.

47:14.499 --> 47:16.532
Our fellow great apes get
it from you know, bugs

47:16.534 --> 47:21.070
during feces, but I prefer
a more sanitary route,

47:21.072 --> 47:23.506
which is one 2500 microamps
of it once a week,

47:23.508 --> 47:27.043
cost less than
five bucks a year,

47:27.045 --> 47:29.912
or vitamin b12 fortified
foods everyday.

47:31.481 --> 47:33.549
- We spend
more money on healthcare

47:33.551 --> 47:35.218
than any other
country in the world.

47:36.320 --> 47:37.987
Yet we have some of
the highest rates

47:37.989 --> 47:40.289
of chronic disease
on the planet.

47:40.291 --> 47:42.391
Fortunately, it seems
that some health insurance

47:42.393 --> 47:45.895
providers including
medicare, are beginning

47:45.897 --> 47:48.264
to embrace the concept
of disease prevention

47:48.266 --> 47:49.999
through diet.

47:50.001 --> 47:51.567
Instead of spending
millions of dollars

47:51.569 --> 47:54.203
trying to simply
manage the problem,

47:54.205 --> 47:56.138
when it might
already be too late.

47:58.508 --> 48:00.476
- So medicare now
accepts for reimbursement

48:00.478 --> 48:03.312
both the Dean ornish program,
for reversing heart disease

48:03.314 --> 48:05.181
as well as the pritikin program.

48:06.216 --> 48:09.318
And this is out of a
recognition that it's not only

48:09.320 --> 48:11.587
safer, it's not only
cheaper, but actually

48:11.589 --> 48:13.956
more effective than
kind of the traditional

48:13.958 --> 48:17.627
approach, which is
very costly surgery,

48:17.629 --> 48:20.029
and a lifetime of drugs.

48:20.031 --> 48:21.197
And so,

48:22.032 --> 48:24.166
I mean this is
great, from a whole,

48:24.168 --> 48:25.368
I mean, the most
important things,

48:25.370 --> 48:27.103
is reducing suffering
and saving lives,

48:27.105 --> 48:29.405
but from kind of a
fiscal responsibility,

48:30.574 --> 48:34.577
I mean, it's so much,
cheaper, so much more

48:34.579 --> 48:37.146
cost effective, that, and
who's footing the bill?

48:37.148 --> 48:39.048
Well, if it's medicare,
it's taxpayer,

48:39.050 --> 48:43.419
so they're saving money by
making people healthier.

48:45.255 --> 48:47.123
- For most
people, it is hard to imagine

48:47.125 --> 48:50.259
that anybody could perform
well as an athlete,

48:50.261 --> 48:53.162
without consuming
any animal products.

48:53.164 --> 48:55.298
Not to mention being
a world class athlete,

48:55.300 --> 48:57.466
or even a world champion.

48:59.102 --> 49:00.636
- I am a professional
triathelete,

49:00.638 --> 49:03.005
specializing in the
iron man distance.

49:03.007 --> 49:05.541
I'm also the ultraman
world champion.

49:05.543 --> 49:07.243
I have been racing for
triathlon professionally

49:07.245 --> 49:11.981
for 10 years, I've
finished 66 iron man races,

49:11.983 --> 49:17.053
and I love to train,
and race all the time.

49:18.088 --> 49:19.388
- I'm an ultra-endurance
athelete,

49:19.390 --> 49:22.425
most people have
heard of an iron man,

49:22.427 --> 49:25.428
if you haven't, an iron man
is a very long triathlon,

49:25.430 --> 49:28.030
during which, over the
course of a one day period,

49:28.032 --> 49:31.167
you swim 2.4 miles, you
ride your bike 112 miles,

49:31.169 --> 49:32.635
and then you run a marathon.

49:32.637 --> 49:36.138
While ultra man is essentially
double that distance,

49:36.140 --> 49:40.309
and in 2009, I was
the fastest American

49:40.311 --> 49:43.212
and 6th place
overall in this race.

49:46.083 --> 49:48.117
- I do believe that last season,

49:48.119 --> 49:50.586
on a plant-based diet
was my strongest.

49:50.588 --> 49:52.021
Than I've ever been.

49:52.023 --> 49:53.055
I did a couple of
iron man races,

49:53.057 --> 49:55.124
that were among the top five,

49:55.126 --> 49:57.259
best performances in my career,

49:57.261 --> 50:00.262
and I was able to win the
ultra man world championship.

50:00.264 --> 50:01.764
- What you're also
seeing are atheltes like

50:01.766 --> 50:04.767
mma fighters, they're
realizing performance gains

50:04.769 --> 50:08.471
they're recovering more quickly
in between their workouts,

50:08.473 --> 50:11.574
you see nba players, NFL
players, NHL players,

50:11.576 --> 50:14.176
olympic athletes, all
kinds of athletes who are

50:14.178 --> 50:18.714
starting to experiment
and explore this way

50:18.716 --> 50:21.050
of eating, and
getting good results.

50:31.161 --> 50:32.695
I've been doing this
for over eight years

50:32.697 --> 50:34.463
right now, I've never
had a problem building

50:34.465 --> 50:36.432
lean muscle mass, i
continue to get stronger,

50:36.434 --> 50:41.103
fitter and faster,
and it's fine.

50:41.105 --> 50:43.039
- For me now, the proof
is in the pudding.

50:43.041 --> 50:46.709
I know that I am like
stronger than I've ever been,

50:46.711 --> 50:48.210
without animal products, and so

50:49.613 --> 50:52.114
I proved it really, like,
to myself and I've hopefully

50:52.116 --> 50:55.384
proved to other people
that it can be done.

51:04.828 --> 51:07.329
- I'm a neurofibromatosis
patient,

51:08.298 --> 51:10.666
I'm an ambassador for a couple

51:10.668 --> 51:13.169
of organizations, that
do philanthropic work

51:13.171 --> 51:15.104
for sick children.

51:15.839 --> 51:18.240
I'm an npst cancer survivor.

51:19.509 --> 51:22.645
Npst is a rare sarcoma,

51:23.780 --> 51:25.815
it's one of the most
aggressive and fast,

51:27.184 --> 51:30.186
infiltrating cancers that
there is on the planet.

51:30.188 --> 51:34.790
I've had over 325 tumors
removed from my body.

51:36.660 --> 51:40.629
I've lived a very, very
rigorous and painful last

51:40.631 --> 51:44.300
three and a half years,
battling for my life,

51:45.168 --> 51:49.171
and I had a decision to make.

51:52.109 --> 51:53.876
I'm either going to
let this take me,

51:55.345 --> 51:56.512
or I'm going to fight.

51:57.347 --> 51:59.348
Like giving up wasn't an option,

51:59.350 --> 52:01.550
I don't know what's
going to happen,

52:01.552 --> 52:03.385
but I'm not going
to die sitting down,

52:03.387 --> 52:06.355
or laying down, I'm going
to keep my hands up,

52:06.357 --> 52:08.324
my head tucked, and
I'm not going to stop

52:08.326 --> 52:10.392
swinging until it's over.

52:10.394 --> 52:12.862
And without a plant-based diet,

52:12.864 --> 52:14.430
I would not be here today.

52:15.765 --> 52:19.168
It kind of kept
my cancer at bay,

52:19.170 --> 52:20.569
and it's allowed me
to thrive in ways

52:20.571 --> 52:22.638
I didn't know was possible.

52:22.640 --> 52:25.441
The insane mindset that

52:26.843 --> 52:29.645
animal protein is the key

52:29.647 --> 52:31.413
to being very healthy,

52:31.415 --> 52:33.282
you know, almost killed me.

52:34.584 --> 52:36.385
I'm not saying plant-based diets

52:37.254 --> 52:40.289
cure, or they're
the end-all, be-all,

52:40.291 --> 52:42.691
but what I am saying
is that if you're

52:42.693 --> 52:45.194
going through some
type of health crisis,

52:46.296 --> 52:49.398
your odds are very,
very much greater

52:50.500 --> 52:53.569
when you embrace a
plant-based lifestyle.

52:53.571 --> 52:55.671
Those are just the facts.

52:55.673 --> 52:57.840
And my life is the living proof.

53:11.354 --> 53:14.356
- In 2006, I attempted suicide,

53:14.358 --> 53:17.860
while I was on 250
milligrams of Zoloft,

53:17.862 --> 53:20.196
for what the doctors
diagnosed as major

53:20.198 --> 53:21.530
depressive disorder.

53:22.632 --> 53:24.466
And I was told I'd
be most likely on it

53:24.468 --> 53:26.335
for the rest of my life.

53:26.337 --> 53:28.737
A week after that i
went into a personal

53:28.739 --> 53:32.374
development course,
and changed my beliefs.

53:32.376 --> 53:34.443
From there, I started
to look at what I was

53:34.445 --> 53:35.778
putting into my body.

53:36.880 --> 53:39.315
And I started to
look at nutrition,

53:39.317 --> 53:41.984
and nutritional healing,
and what I could do.

53:41.986 --> 53:46.722
And it led me to going within,

53:46.724 --> 53:48.290
and back to nature.

53:48.292 --> 53:50.926
I stripped away all
of the processed food,

53:52.395 --> 53:55.798
I went back to just
eating raw fruits

53:55.800 --> 53:59.301
and vegetables, and juicing,
and green smoothies,

54:00.437 --> 54:04.273
and I started to have
a sense of a natural,

54:04.275 --> 54:07.743
natural happy high started
to come into my body,

54:07.745 --> 54:11.947
and I was feeling better

54:11.949 --> 54:15.017
than I'd felt in many years.

54:15.019 --> 54:19.355
The symptoms of depression
started to drop away,

54:19.357 --> 54:21.824
the heavy, sluggish,
tired feelings

54:21.826 --> 54:24.660
that I couldn't cope,
the chronic fatigue,

54:25.929 --> 54:29.298
the aches, you know,
everything started to shift.

54:29.300 --> 54:33.869
And I started to
feel my cells were

54:33.871 --> 54:35.504
transforming on some level.

54:36.840 --> 54:38.941
I'd made the decision
that I didn't want to put

54:40.043 --> 54:43.879
ever again, the fear
of death and suffering

54:43.881 --> 54:48.417
of another life, and eating
animals into my body.

54:48.419 --> 54:51.687
And that translated to

54:51.689 --> 54:54.690
a shift for me, I cured
my own depression.

54:55.625 --> 54:57.026
And I've never looked back.

55:05.935 --> 55:08.437
- Eating tasty
food is one of the biggest

55:08.439 --> 55:09.738
pleasures in life.

55:09.740 --> 55:11.573
So many people might
argue that even though

55:11.575 --> 55:14.677
eating an unhealthy diet
is not good for them,

55:14.679 --> 55:17.680
they don't want to jeopardize
the fun aspect of it.

55:17.682 --> 55:20.516
And therefore, they continue
eating unhealthy things.

55:21.451 --> 55:23.052
But one thing that
i came to discover

55:23.054 --> 55:25.387
is that when you
transition into a healthier

55:25.389 --> 55:28.424
eating lifestyle, you do
not have to compromise

55:28.426 --> 55:29.792
on taste.

55:29.794 --> 55:32.494
Yes, you will go through
a transition period,

55:32.496 --> 55:34.530
but once your taste buds,
and your body's chemistry

55:34.532 --> 55:37.099
begins to change, you
will start to crave

55:37.101 --> 55:38.901
and really enjoy these foods.

55:40.003 --> 55:42.504
It is important to
find food you like,

55:42.506 --> 55:44.406
and once you realize
that almost every dish

55:44.408 --> 55:46.475
can be made plant-based,
you will see that

55:46.477 --> 55:48.544
it is not that hard at all.

55:50.613 --> 55:52.881
- There's such a stigma
with the word vegan,

55:52.883 --> 55:54.883
I guess that people
just get automatically

55:54.885 --> 55:56.719
turned off and just assume
that it's going to suck.

55:56.721 --> 55:57.986
But it's like it doesn't.

55:57.988 --> 55:59.388
If anything, to me, and
i mean, that was another

55:59.390 --> 56:01.557
big thing, why I do it,
because it's better.

56:01.559 --> 56:03.592
To me, I think food's
just way better this way.

56:03.594 --> 56:05.461
I would say just try it.

56:05.463 --> 56:07.396
You know, you'll
surprise yourself.

56:07.398 --> 56:09.531
- When you're
becoming vegetarian,

56:09.533 --> 56:11.367
and you've given up
the meat and the dairy

56:11.369 --> 56:13.435
and the eggs, the only
thing you know for food,

56:13.437 --> 56:14.937
you think you're going
to starve to death.

56:15.872 --> 56:17.773
You have to understand that

56:17.775 --> 56:19.742
marinara sauce, and
pasta, and lasagna,

56:19.744 --> 56:24.079
and bean burritos, and oatmeal,
and hash-brown potatoes,

56:24.081 --> 56:26.949
and so on, things you
love, that's where you get

56:26.951 --> 56:29.084
your calories and your
protein and your vitamins

56:29.086 --> 56:30.886
and your minerals.

56:30.888 --> 56:32.755
- There are so many
beautiful, wonderful

56:32.757 --> 56:36.392
amazing, delicious
plant-based foods out there.

56:36.394 --> 56:38.894
In fact, when I started
to do this a whole world

56:38.896 --> 56:41.530
opened up to me, and
when you begin to eat

56:41.532 --> 56:44.466
these nutrient dense
foods that are actually

56:44.468 --> 56:47.870
fuelling you, that are
actually nourishing you,

56:47.872 --> 56:49.905
with all of these
amazing vital nutrients

56:49.907 --> 56:52.708
and micronutrients,
you start to feel good,

56:52.710 --> 56:55.778
your cravings change, and
your taste buds change.

56:55.780 --> 56:57.913
You know, that cheeseburger,
that you couldn't

56:57.915 --> 56:59.948
get out of your mind, suddenly,

56:59.950 --> 57:01.750
you're not thinking
about that anymore,

57:01.752 --> 57:04.586
and you're actually
craving that Kale smoothie.

57:04.588 --> 57:06.054
And that's something
that happened to me

57:06.056 --> 57:08.023
that I would have never
thought would have happened.

57:08.025 --> 57:10.125
- People think that vegan
food just tastes like crap.

57:10.127 --> 57:11.727
And that's not true.

57:11.729 --> 57:13.128
I think that people
think that being vegan

57:13.130 --> 57:14.930
might potentially be strange,

57:14.932 --> 57:17.666
that people are weird, that
you have to be a hippie,

57:17.668 --> 57:19.768
or you have to embrace
wearing hemp clothes,

57:19.770 --> 57:21.203
or something.

57:21.205 --> 57:22.571
- You want to have a burger,
you can have a burger.

57:22.573 --> 57:23.872
You want to have
spaghetti and meatballs,

57:23.874 --> 57:25.841
you can have spaghetti
and wheatballs.

57:25.843 --> 57:27.209
You want to have fries,
you want to have chocolate

57:27.211 --> 57:30.479
mousse, you want to
have pumpkin pie,

57:30.481 --> 57:32.581
you want to have stuffing,
you want to have,

57:32.583 --> 57:35.484
you know, even hotdogs.

57:35.486 --> 57:37.653
- And so when you're looking at

57:37.655 --> 57:40.155
the idea of taking the leap,

57:40.157 --> 57:42.691
into this way of
eating and living,

57:42.693 --> 57:44.560
don't look at what
you're going to be

57:44.562 --> 57:47.963
not eating, embrace
and be excited

57:47.965 --> 57:50.766
about the adventure
of all these new foods

57:50.768 --> 57:52.634
you're going to be
bringing into your life.

57:53.870 --> 57:55.204
- Eating
healthy will not do you

57:55.206 --> 57:57.673
much good if you
can't afford it.

57:57.675 --> 58:00.008
Or if it leaves a big
hole in your pocket.

58:00.010 --> 58:02.478
So my next question
was is it possible

58:02.480 --> 58:04.746
to eat healthy on
a tight budget?

58:06.783 --> 58:09.718
- A common misconception
is that a whole

58:09.720 --> 58:12.754
foods plant-based diet
is very expensive.

58:12.756 --> 58:17.726
I routinely post pictures
of my grocery receipt,

58:17.728 --> 58:19.495
and I take my whole
bounty that I bought

58:19.497 --> 58:22.030
at the produce market, and
put it out on the table

58:22.032 --> 58:25.667
so people can see, how
much I end up with,

58:25.669 --> 58:26.969
and they're shocked.

58:26.971 --> 58:29.671
Whole grains that
we buy in bulk,

58:29.673 --> 58:31.673
are very inexpensive.

58:31.675 --> 58:34.176
You're going to cut your
grocery bills in half,

58:34.178 --> 58:36.278
from a typical
standard American diet,

58:36.280 --> 58:38.747
in the beginning, it might
seem like a lot of effort,

58:38.749 --> 58:40.649
but in the long run, you're
saving all this money

58:40.651 --> 58:42.851
for all the new clothes
you're going to have to buy

58:42.853 --> 58:45.721
for the new slim
you that is produced

58:45.723 --> 58:48.690
from eating this whole
foods plant-based diet.

58:48.692 --> 58:50.659
- It's easy to go into
those markets and say,

58:50.661 --> 58:52.261
"there's no way
that I can do this."

58:52.263 --> 58:53.795
But the truth of
the matter is that

58:53.797 --> 58:56.164
it doesn't have to be expensive,

58:56.166 --> 58:57.766
it doesn't have to
be inconvenient,

58:57.768 --> 58:59.268
it doesn't have to be
difficult, it doesn't have

58:59.270 --> 59:01.036
to be time consuming.

59:01.038 --> 59:03.171
And my experience is
that it has actually

59:03.173 --> 59:05.707
simplified my life,
and it's been cheaper

59:05.709 --> 59:07.776
than eating the
other way around.

59:09.546 --> 59:10.913
- At this
point of my journey,

59:10.915 --> 59:12.681
I already had seen
enough evidence

59:12.683 --> 59:15.884
about the benefits and
safety of a plant based diet

59:15.886 --> 59:19.154
for adults, but was this
lifestyle also ideal

59:19.156 --> 59:21.089
and safe for children?

59:22.926 --> 59:25.727
- Not only can
children grow healthy

59:25.729 --> 59:27.563
on a plant-based
diet, they'll grow

59:27.565 --> 59:29.765
healthiest on a
plant-based diet.

59:29.767 --> 59:31.266
I mean, we have an
epidemic of childhood

59:31.268 --> 59:36.004
obesity, and children
raised plant-based,

59:36.006 --> 59:37.739
actually grow taller
by about an inch,

59:37.741 --> 59:39.775
they grow about an inch
taller than meat eating

59:39.777 --> 59:41.677
incumbents, and
most importantly,

59:41.679 --> 59:45.147
they grow less in a
horizontal direction, right?

59:45.149 --> 59:46.982
They don't have
the same problems

59:46.984 --> 59:50.586
with childhood obesity,
so Dr. Benjamin Spock,

59:50.588 --> 59:53.355
the most esteemed
pediatrician of all time,

59:53.357 --> 59:54.823
wrote one of the
bestselling books

59:54.825 --> 59:57.059
in human history,
recommended in his final

59:57.061 --> 01:00:00.195
edition, the 7th edition
of his book before he died

01:00:00.197 --> 01:00:02.998
in his 90's, that all
children should be raised

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.068
with zero exposure
to meat and dairy.

01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:07.302
And he did this
because he saw what

01:00:07.304 --> 01:00:09.338
you know, the older
generations were dying

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:12.674
from, and wanted to get
them off on a good start.

01:00:12.676 --> 01:00:16.812
I mean the leading
killers of our children

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:20.315
will eventually be, same thing.

01:00:20.317 --> 01:00:22.117
Heart disease,
cancer, strokes, copd,

01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:24.620
diabetes, hypertension.

01:00:24.622 --> 01:00:26.021
These are diseases
that can be prevented

01:00:26.023 --> 01:00:28.824
in many cases arrested,
or even reversed

01:00:28.826 --> 01:00:30.859
with a healthy enough
plant-based diet.

01:00:32.261 --> 01:00:33.895
- As a new
father, I wondered,

01:00:33.897 --> 01:00:36.231
how could I get my
daughter to eat healthy?

01:00:36.233 --> 01:00:37.833
Since getting her to
eat anything at all

01:00:37.835 --> 01:00:40.202
can sometimes be a problem.

01:00:40.204 --> 01:00:41.803
There's so much
junk being marketed

01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:44.339
to kids out there, and
it is often difficult

01:00:44.341 --> 01:00:46.842
for parents to
transition their children

01:00:46.844 --> 01:00:48.744
to healthier food options.

01:00:50.346 --> 01:00:52.381
- I would not be
surprised at all

01:00:52.383 --> 01:00:56.284
that if in 15,
20, 25 years time,

01:00:57.654 --> 01:01:01.957
people will look back at
the last 10 to 20 years,

01:01:01.959 --> 01:01:06.862
and they'll say, "how did
those people give that food

01:01:06.864 --> 01:01:08.063
"to their children?"

01:01:12.268 --> 01:01:13.969
- A big question that
we get all the time

01:01:13.971 --> 01:01:16.772
is, "how can I get my
kids to eat better?"

01:01:16.774 --> 01:01:19.341
I think every parent
wants their kids to eat

01:01:19.343 --> 01:01:24.079
healthy, and it's
difficult, especially when

01:01:24.081 --> 01:01:25.881
everywhere you look, there's
a fast food restaurant,

01:01:25.883 --> 01:01:28.450
or a processed food snack
that is being marketed

01:01:28.452 --> 01:01:30.085
towards children.

01:01:30.087 --> 01:01:31.420
And the first thing
that I always say is,

01:01:31.422 --> 01:01:33.889
"you have to lead by example."

01:01:33.891 --> 01:01:36.324
As a parent, you can't
be eating lousy foods,

01:01:36.326 --> 01:01:38.927
and expect your
children to eat healthy,

01:01:38.929 --> 01:01:40.295
because you tell them to.

01:01:40.297 --> 01:01:43.398
So you have to walk your
walk, that's number one.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:45.867
The second thing is, i
encourage all parents

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:51.073
to make the preparation
of meals and the shopping

01:01:51.075 --> 01:01:53.842
of food inclusive
with their children.

01:01:53.844 --> 01:01:57.245
The more you can bring
your kids into the fold,

01:01:57.247 --> 01:02:00.415
the more they're going
to develop an emotional

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:03.719
attachment to where
their food comes from,

01:02:03.721 --> 01:02:05.053
how it's prepared,
and the impact that

01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:06.888
it's having on their health.

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:08.423
- Really get inside their heads,

01:02:08.425 --> 01:02:10.826
and sort of think
how they would think.

01:02:10.828 --> 01:02:14.162
Keep telling them what
is good, what is bad,

01:02:14.164 --> 01:02:17.966
won't probably work, you
have to interact with them,

01:02:17.968 --> 01:02:20.302
you have to show
them what's possible.

01:02:20.304 --> 01:02:23.205
Get your hands dirty,
get the kids to help you,

01:02:23.207 --> 01:02:25.107
and let them own
what they're doing.

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:29.211
If you always put
something in front of them

01:02:29.213 --> 01:02:31.813
in a silver platter,
and let them consume

01:02:31.815 --> 01:02:33.815
that information,
you know, it'll only

01:02:33.817 --> 01:02:33.815
work for so long.

01:02:33.817 --> 01:02:33.815
What you've got to do,
you've got to get them

01:02:33.817 --> 01:02:39.988
involved, let them have
the responsibility.

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:42.290
The way I approach it
is that I try to make it

01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:45.427
as fun as possible, use
colors, use flavors,

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:48.997
teach a little thing that
they never knew about,

01:02:48.999 --> 01:02:53.335
use gadgets that,
normal people won't see,

01:02:53.337 --> 01:02:55.837
but I want them to go
away with a feeling

01:02:55.839 --> 01:02:58.073
of accomplishment,
and something that

01:02:58.075 --> 01:03:00.909
they're eager to share
to their friends.

01:03:01.844 --> 01:03:03.211
Hopefully their parents.

01:03:03.213 --> 01:03:04.846
I think that's the best part.

01:03:04.848 --> 01:03:06.114
It's like holding a bird.

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:07.949
You don't want to
hold it too tight,

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:07.949
you're going to hurt the bird.

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:10.318
You don't want to
hold it too loosely,

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.920
or it's going to fly away.

01:03:11.922 --> 01:03:13.555
That's something that
each individual parent

01:03:13.557 --> 01:03:16.992
has a specific
knowledge of their kid.

01:03:16.994 --> 01:03:18.860
- I get the questions
all the time.

01:03:18.862 --> 01:03:20.896
"What do I do, how do I start,

01:03:20.898 --> 01:03:22.798
"how do I tell my kids,
oh, they're going to be

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:22.798
"so disappointed that
they're not having

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:27.202
"meat on their plates, that
they're not having dairy."

01:03:27.204 --> 01:03:30.272
Try a vegan burger, it's
basically the same thing,

01:03:30.274 --> 01:03:31.940
you just leave the meat out.

01:03:31.942 --> 01:03:31.940
That's great for
kids, because why?

01:03:31.942 --> 01:03:34.876
You're going to put
that burger on that bun,

01:03:34.878 --> 01:03:36.845
you're going to put all
the fixings on that,

01:03:36.847 --> 01:03:39.214
whatever your kids like, you
make it exactly the same,

01:03:39.216 --> 01:03:41.583
that's a great way
to get started.

01:03:41.585 --> 01:03:43.084
- When I think with
the younger generation,

01:03:43.086 --> 01:03:45.287
what's so exciting is,
is that they get to start

01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:49.958
young, I mean, I'm not
going to have any regrets,

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.226
but it sort of bums me
out a little bit that I'm

01:03:51.228 --> 01:03:53.595
just now discovering
this in my 30's because

01:03:53.597 --> 01:03:55.997
I wish I would have done
this when I was younger,

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:58.500
because just the thoughts
of like the energy,

01:03:58.502 --> 01:04:00.969
that I would've had in college.

01:04:00.971 --> 01:04:03.338
- I think the other
thing is to not have

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:06.274
hard and fast rules,
with your children,

01:04:06.276 --> 01:04:09.845
you can't eat that, and you
know, you have to eat this.

01:04:09.847 --> 01:04:14.249
And instead, respect them as
independent sentient beings,

01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:16.551
who have you know,
the wherewithal

01:04:16.553 --> 01:04:19.521
to make conscious
decisions for themselves.

01:04:19.523 --> 01:04:23.058
So, at our home, we
serve plant based foods,

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:24.993
all the time, we don't
have any animal products

01:04:24.995 --> 01:04:27.896
here, but when my 10
year old daughter goes

01:04:27.898 --> 01:04:31.166
to a birthday party, she's
surrounded by you know,

01:04:31.168 --> 01:04:34.269
chicken McNuggets, and
birthday cake and all of that,

01:04:34.271 --> 01:04:38.106
and we don't say to her,
"you can't eat those foods."

01:04:38.108 --> 01:04:41.243
We say, "have a great time
at the birthday party,

01:04:41.245 --> 01:04:44.045
"and make the right
choice for you."

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:45.447
And that doesn't mean
that she always makes

01:04:45.449 --> 01:04:49.618
the right choice, that
way you are empowering

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:51.953
them, this is a lifetime
we're talking about.

01:04:51.955 --> 01:04:54.389
This is a long road ahead,
so it's about getting

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:56.958
your children to think
consciously about their

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.261
own choices, so that
when they reach the age

01:04:59.263 --> 01:05:02.163
of maturity, they are
informed and educated

01:05:02.165 --> 01:05:06.902
and prepared to be responsible
stewards of the planet,

01:05:06.904 --> 01:05:09.170
and responsible stewards
of their own bodies.

01:05:10.306 --> 01:05:12.207
- I could not
make a film about food choices

01:05:12.209 --> 01:05:15.043
and not explore the
topic of organic,

01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:16.945
versus non-organic.

01:05:16.947 --> 01:05:18.280
It seems that
everybody's obssessed

01:05:18.282 --> 01:05:20.682
with those words, and
it's becoming increasingly

01:05:20.684 --> 01:05:24.986
adverse to foods that don't
carry an organic label.

01:05:24.988 --> 01:05:27.222
Others fear that consuming
more plant based food

01:05:27.224 --> 01:05:29.157
might be damaging
to their health,

01:05:29.159 --> 01:05:32.627
due to the increase of
pesticides in those foods.

01:05:32.629 --> 01:05:35.196
But should this really
be our biggest concern?

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:39.567
- Fear of pesticides
should never keep anyone

01:05:39.569 --> 01:05:42.437
from maximizing their
fruit and vegetable intake.

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:46.141
There, you know, so there's
been like chemic computer

01:05:46.143 --> 01:05:49.177
modeling studies that
suggest that, so for example,

01:05:49.179 --> 01:05:51.179
if half of Americans ate
a single more serving

01:05:51.181 --> 01:05:53.148
of fruits and vegetables
a day, we'd prevent

01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:56.451
20,000 cancer deaths every year.

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:58.520
If just half the people,
just one more serving,

01:05:58.522 --> 01:06:02.357
20,000 people would not
have died from cancer,

01:06:02.359 --> 01:06:04.559
would normally have died
if they hadn't done that.

01:06:04.561 --> 01:06:06.728
So that's how powerful
fruits and vegetables are.

01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:10.365
But, because these
were conventional,

01:06:10.367 --> 01:06:12.567
pesticide laden
fruits and vegetables,

01:06:12.569 --> 01:06:15.470
they estimated that it
would, that the extra

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:17.238
pesticide burden from
all those extra fruits

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:20.175
and vegetables would cause 10

01:06:20.177 --> 01:06:21.609
extra cancer deaths.

01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:26.147
So in all it would only
prevent 19, 990 cancer deaths.

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:27.983
But that's what we're
looking at a year,

01:06:27.985 --> 01:06:29.684
this tremendous benefit.

01:06:29.686 --> 01:06:31.252
Then a tiny bump in risk.

01:06:31.254 --> 01:06:33.688
So, okay, great, choose
organic whenever you can,

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:36.291
why accept any risk,
why not get all benefit?

01:06:36.293 --> 01:06:39.227
Sure, but we should never
let concern about pesticides

01:06:39.229 --> 01:06:42.230
in any way dissuade us
from stuffing our face

01:06:42.232 --> 01:06:45.400
with as many healthy fruits
and vegetables as possible.

01:06:45.402 --> 01:06:47.769
- If you're eating meat,
and you're eating commercial

01:06:47.771 --> 01:06:50.138
meat, and you're worried
about switching to plant-based

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:53.274
diet, and worried about the
pesticides in the produce,

01:06:53.276 --> 01:06:54.743
you're being ridiculous,
because you're getting

01:06:54.745 --> 01:06:57.746
a fraction of the pesticides
by eating the vegetable,

01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:00.248
that you can mostly wash it off.

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:01.750
Remember, you can
wash, you can soak your

01:07:01.752 --> 01:07:04.219
vegetables and use a
wash to get pesticide

01:07:04.221 --> 01:07:04.219
residue off.

01:07:04.221 --> 01:07:08.123
You cannot wash the pesticide
off of the hamburger

01:07:08.125 --> 01:07:09.657
meat you're about to prepare.

01:07:09.659 --> 01:07:12.060
- I encourage people
just to go ahead and buy

01:07:12.062 --> 01:07:14.229
whatever produce
they can afford,

01:07:14.231 --> 01:07:16.097
whatever produce
looks the freshest

01:07:16.099 --> 01:07:18.099
that week in the grocery store,

01:07:18.101 --> 01:07:19.701
and whatever's on sale,

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:21.436
so that's where they're
going to save money,

01:07:21.438 --> 01:07:24.039
is not worrying about,

01:07:24.041 --> 01:07:25.707
"i have to buy
organic bell peppers,

01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:28.143
"and they cost me
four dollars each."

01:07:28.145 --> 01:07:31.613
That's not a
sustainable lifestyle.

01:07:42.291 --> 01:07:43.758
- Besides
the health aspect related

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:46.828
to our food choices, I also
realized during the production

01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:49.697
of this film, that there
was another very important

01:07:49.699 --> 01:07:52.734
factor, that is
often overlooked,

01:07:52.736 --> 01:07:54.602
ignored, or misunderstood.

01:07:55.604 --> 01:07:57.672
The connection
between food choices,

01:07:57.674 --> 01:07:57.672
and the environment.

01:07:57.674 --> 01:08:01.309
I was really shocked after
reading the united nations

01:08:01.311 --> 01:08:03.344
report on global warming.

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:06.081
After all, it is hard
to grasp the idea

01:08:06.083 --> 01:08:08.116
that the burger, or
steak on our plates

01:08:08.118 --> 01:08:10.251
might be contributing
to things such as

01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:12.854
global warming, water scarcity,

01:08:12.856 --> 01:08:17.158
species extinction,
the destruction of
the Amazon forest,

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:21.162
the depletion of our oceans,
and even world hunger.

01:08:21.163 --> 01:08:23.631
I had a hard time
understanding it at first,

01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:26.234
but once I began
digging a little deeper,

01:08:26.236 --> 01:08:28.269
the connection became clear.

01:08:30.805 --> 01:08:32.474
- Now, it's seven
billion people,

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:34.876
what we eat, determines
how the whole planet

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:37.779
is used, and what's
happening now

01:08:37.781 --> 01:08:40.180
is that, as we run out of land,

01:08:40.183 --> 01:08:41.549
to grow these
animals and the food

01:08:41.551 --> 01:08:44.486
for the animals, we
burn down rain forests,

01:08:44.488 --> 01:08:46.621
to aquire more land.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:48.122
And the number one
cause of all of that

01:08:48.125 --> 01:08:49.390
is our food choices.

01:08:57.533 --> 01:09:00.201
- It's expected to have a
40% shortage in fresh water

01:09:00.203 --> 01:09:02.804
supplies by the year 2030.

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:06.908
We have again, irreversible
loss of biodiversity,

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:09.544
ecosystems, and extinction
of species faster than

01:09:09.546 --> 01:09:13.281
we've ever seen before, for
the past 65 million years.

01:09:13.283 --> 01:09:15.483
We have a world hunger
issue with a little less

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:18.219
that a billion people on
earth suffering from hunger,

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:22.290
with about 350 children
dying from hunger each hour.

01:09:24.727 --> 01:09:26.528
- You might
be asking yourself,

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:28.563
how is all that possible?

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:30.430
And I had the same questions,

01:09:30.433 --> 01:09:33.234
because in fact,
many of these issues

01:09:33.236 --> 01:09:36.237
are not only related
to our food choices.

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:38.238
Many are very complex problems,

01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:41.276
with several social,
political, economic,

01:09:41.278 --> 01:09:43.444
and cultural variables.

01:09:43.446 --> 01:09:45.913
But here are some
intriguing facts.

01:09:45.916 --> 01:09:49.716
70% of our arable land
is used to grow crops

01:09:49.719 --> 01:09:52.420
for animals and not humans.

01:09:53.322 --> 01:09:56.891
It takes on average
2400 gallons of water

01:09:56.893 --> 01:10:00.228
and 12 pounds of grain to
make one pound of beef.

01:10:01.463 --> 01:10:04.432
Five million acres of
rainforest are destroyed

01:10:04.434 --> 01:10:07.936
every year, so companies
can graze animals

01:10:07.938 --> 01:10:09.737
and grow food for these animals.

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:13.741
The excrements of 80
billion land animals

01:10:13.743 --> 01:10:17.579
killed every year for
food are not treated.

01:10:17.581 --> 01:10:19.781
And go back into
our water basins,

01:10:19.783 --> 01:10:23.384
and our oceans, creating
a lot of pollution.

01:10:23.386 --> 01:10:24.953
And these are just
a few examples.

01:10:25.955 --> 01:10:27.555
So when you consider
these facts,

01:10:28.524 --> 01:10:30.458
it all begins to
fall into place.

01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:34.295
- We need to focus
more, and understand

01:10:34.297 --> 01:10:36.431
more what the footprint
is, the complete

01:10:36.433 --> 01:10:40.301
life cycle analysis, ecological
environmental depleting

01:10:40.303 --> 01:10:44.339
footprint is of that
item is versus just how

01:10:44.341 --> 01:10:45.573
close it is to you.

01:10:45.575 --> 01:10:47.242
Or whether it's
even organic or not.

01:10:47.244 --> 01:10:49.377
It's much less of a
footprint to eat something

01:10:49.379 --> 01:10:52.347
that was grown 1500 miles away,

01:10:52.349 --> 01:10:54.949
if it was plant-based,
than it is to eat

01:10:54.951 --> 01:10:57.418
a food item that
was slaughtered,

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.386
that was an animal product,

01:10:58.388 --> 01:10:59.454
by your next door neighbor.

01:10:59.456 --> 01:11:00.755
And our largest footprint is,

01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:03.358
you know, across all sectors,

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:04.892
our food choice
specifically as it relates

01:11:04.894 --> 01:11:04.892
to eating animals.

01:11:07.563 --> 01:11:09.764
- No matter
how green, or eco-friendly

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:12.867
we try to be, the truth
is that by nature,

01:11:12.869 --> 01:11:15.837
we are a very
destructive species.

01:11:15.839 --> 01:11:17.805
Almost everything
we do has a negative

01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:19.540
impact on the environment.

01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:23.478
So many people often try to
minimize their footprint,

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:25.713
by doing things like
switching to more effective

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:29.017
light bulbs, taking
short showers,

01:11:29.019 --> 01:11:32.353
bicycling to work,
using solar energy,

01:11:32.355 --> 01:11:34.756
or even buying an electric car.

01:11:34.758 --> 01:11:37.058
And those are all great things.

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:38.626
But the question is,

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:40.795
are these actions
in fact the easiest

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:43.665
and most effective when
it comes to helping

01:11:43.667 --> 01:11:46.434
protect our planet
and its' resources?

01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:49.704
- You look at the
four major problems.

01:11:49.706 --> 01:11:51.706
We've got overpopulation,

01:11:51.708 --> 01:11:53.408
and we're adding about
a million people every

01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:54.809
four days, net.

01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:56.511
Then you get to the way we live,

01:11:56.513 --> 01:11:58.446
and the way we consume stuff,

01:11:58.448 --> 01:12:01.649
all that stuff is coming
from finite resources

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:04.352
which we are steadily depleting.

01:12:04.354 --> 01:12:06.454
So those first two factors
the overpopulation,

01:12:06.456 --> 01:12:09.657
and the way we live, are
driving the third one,

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:12.493
which is our dependence
on fossil fuels.

01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:13.828
Look at the numbers.

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:16.898
Since 1950, the
line for consumption

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:19.967
of fossil fuels have
gone steadily up,

01:12:19.969 --> 01:12:22.970
every year, and there's
no end in sight.

01:12:22.972 --> 01:12:25.606
The fourth big driver,
of all of these

01:12:25.608 --> 01:12:29.110
environmental issues,
particularly global warming,

01:12:29.112 --> 01:12:31.446
is the way we eat,
is our consumption

01:12:31.448 --> 01:12:32.814
of the meat, dairy,
eggs and fish,

01:12:32.816 --> 01:12:34.415
and that keeps going up.

01:12:34.417 --> 01:12:38.019
It requires, per calorie,
over 10 times as much

01:12:38.021 --> 01:12:40.688
land, 10 times as much water,

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:42.657
and 10 times as much energy.

01:12:42.659 --> 01:12:43.891
And it ranges.

01:12:43.893 --> 01:12:45.560
But the average is
well over 10 times,

01:12:45.562 --> 01:12:46.928
and that's a big number.

01:12:46.930 --> 01:12:49.063
Now the good news
is, we can change

01:12:49.065 --> 01:12:51.966
what we eat, any
individual over night.

01:12:53.535 --> 01:12:54.936
People say, "wow, what
would happen if everybody

01:12:54.938 --> 01:12:56.637
"changed at once?"

01:12:56.639 --> 01:12:57.939
Well, that's not
going to happen.

01:12:57.941 --> 01:12:59.841
The bad news is, those
first three items,

01:12:59.843 --> 01:13:03.511
overpopulation,
over consumption,

01:13:03.513 --> 01:13:07.482
and dependence on fossil
fuels, each one of those would

01:13:07.484 --> 01:13:11.519
take decades, if not
centuries to fix.

01:13:13.489 --> 01:13:15.022
- With more
and more people embracing

01:13:15.024 --> 01:13:18.593
the idea of reducing their
intake of animal products,

01:13:18.595 --> 01:13:21.429
or adopting some kind
of a plant-based diet,

01:13:21.431 --> 01:13:24.031
it seems that things are
moving in the right direction.

01:13:24.933 --> 01:13:26.100
But are they, really?

01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:28.536
- You know, I hear people
saying, "things are

01:13:28.538 --> 01:13:29.837
"are getting better.

01:13:29.839 --> 01:13:31.806
"You know, we see
people putting solar

01:13:31.808 --> 01:13:33.508
"panels up, and more
people are eating

01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:35.676
"plant-based, and
there's vegan restaurants

01:13:35.678 --> 01:13:38.913
"going in down the street,
things are getting better."

01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:40.715
Well, not really.

01:13:40.717 --> 01:13:42.583
And not even close.

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:43.951
For every individual,

01:13:43.953 --> 01:13:45.620
that's moving in the direction

01:13:45.622 --> 01:13:47.789
of a plant-based diet,

01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:49.791
there's a hundred people moving

01:13:49.793 --> 01:13:51.426
in the other direction.

01:13:51.428 --> 01:13:53.728
We've got to double
our food production

01:13:53.730 --> 01:13:56.597
in the next 40 years,
to feed the nine billion

01:13:56.599 --> 01:13:58.533
that we'll have by 2050.

01:14:00.636 --> 01:14:02.537
- When it
comes to global warming,

01:14:02.539 --> 01:14:04.672
the production of
animals for food

01:14:04.674 --> 01:14:07.975
currently contributes to
about 14.5% of the total

01:14:07.977 --> 01:14:10.111
global warming effect.

01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:12.079
A contribution larger
than the entire

01:14:12.081 --> 01:14:14.582
global transportation
sector combined.

01:14:15.918 --> 01:14:19.587
Livestock amounts to 53%
of nitrous oxide emissions,

01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:22.790
44% of methane gas,

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:25.693
and 5% of the total
carbon dioxide

01:14:25.695 --> 01:14:27.595
released in our atmosphere.

01:14:32.935 --> 01:14:35.636
- Raising livestock
and eating fish,

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:38.673
and also producing dairy
is one of the largest

01:14:38.675 --> 01:14:41.709
contributing factors
to climate change.

01:14:41.711 --> 01:14:43.544
And the public
needs to know this,

01:14:43.546 --> 01:14:46.647
and policies need to
be enacted to help

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:46.647
eliminate that.

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:49.550
It's one of the easiest
ways that we have

01:14:49.552 --> 01:14:53.754
to not just adapt to, but
to mitigate climate change.

01:14:53.756 --> 01:14:56.257
And it can be done as
easy as just changing

01:14:56.259 --> 01:14:57.859
out what you have on your plate.

01:15:03.632 --> 01:15:06.200
- Organic
grass fed beef

01:15:06.202 --> 01:15:08.169
seems to be the new trend.

01:15:08.171 --> 01:15:10.571
And the idea sounds
really appealing.

01:15:10.573 --> 01:15:14.542
Cows that live off grass
don't take any antibiotics,

01:15:14.544 --> 01:15:16.177
and therefore supposedly
provide a healthier

01:15:16.179 --> 01:15:19.113
food source for us,
when compared to factory

01:15:19.115 --> 01:15:21.148
farmed animals.

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:22.817
But is there a catch?

01:15:22.819 --> 01:15:25.086
- It's a very large
movement today,

01:15:25.088 --> 01:15:26.554
and I think what's
happening is that

01:15:26.556 --> 01:15:29.590
there's been a shift
because of more and more

01:15:29.592 --> 01:15:31.592
people being concerned
about the humane

01:15:31.594 --> 01:15:33.861
raising of animals, and
moving away from factory

01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:36.998
farms, they're moving
toward grass fed operations,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.633
or pasture fed operations.

01:15:38.635 --> 01:15:41.769
It's a complete fabrication
by the meat and dairy

01:15:41.771 --> 01:15:44.171
industries to
continue perpetuating

01:15:44.173 --> 01:15:46.607
the slaughtering of
animals, because even though

01:15:46.609 --> 01:15:48.609
some animal might
be humane raised,

01:15:48.611 --> 01:15:50.311
they're still not humane killed,

01:15:50.313 --> 01:15:52.747
and all of the animals
that are still placed

01:15:52.749 --> 01:15:54.215
on your plate have
to be slaughtered

01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:55.883
in some manner, and
so there's still

01:15:55.885 --> 01:15:58.019
a humane issue there,
but from an environmental

01:15:58.021 --> 01:16:01.722
standpoint, in many aspects,
raising grass fed beef

01:16:01.724 --> 01:16:05.760
is less sustainable than
factory fed animals,

01:16:05.762 --> 01:16:08.963
and the reason is, because
it's so land intensive.

01:16:08.965 --> 01:16:11.899
It may require eight
pounds of feed to produce

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:14.201
one pound of an animal
product, if it were beef,

01:16:14.203 --> 01:16:16.971
but in a grass fed situation,
sometimes, it's 10 times

01:16:16.973 --> 01:16:20.741
that much, it may be 70,
80 times from a grass fed

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:22.777
to a grain fed beef.

01:16:22.779 --> 01:16:24.712
Additionally, from a
climate change standpoint,

01:16:24.714 --> 01:16:26.714
grass fed cattle
produce 40 to 60%

01:16:26.716 --> 01:16:29.850
more greenhouse gas
emissions, meaning methane,

01:16:29.852 --> 01:16:31.786
carbon dioxide,
land use changes,

01:16:31.788 --> 01:16:34.088
than a grain fed cow would.

01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:37.692
- Another thing
often taken for granted

01:16:37.694 --> 01:16:39.794
is the depletion of our oceans.

01:16:40.662 --> 01:16:42.797
We often think of
fish as a never ending

01:16:42.799 --> 01:16:45.900
self replenishing food source,

01:16:45.902 --> 01:16:48.736
but the truth seems
to be quite different.

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:52.340
- Over 90% of all the
big fish in the oceans

01:16:52.342 --> 01:16:54.342
are already gone.

01:16:54.344 --> 01:16:56.978
80% of commercial fisheries
are over exploited,

01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:58.379
or depleted.

01:16:58.381 --> 01:17:01.048
The fishing fleets are
chasing the last of the fish.

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:02.917
And have to travel
further and further away

01:17:02.919 --> 01:17:05.686
from the land and deeper
and deeper into the ocean

01:17:05.688 --> 01:17:06.887
to catch them.

01:17:06.889 --> 01:17:08.356
I've seen illegal
fishing in Antarctica,

01:17:08.358 --> 01:17:11.058
and that's as far away
from land as you can get.

01:17:13.662 --> 01:17:15.763
- When someone sits
down at a table,

01:17:15.765 --> 01:17:18.799
to eat fish or seafood
on their plate,

01:17:19.701 --> 01:17:21.836
what they're really
doing is they're eating

01:17:21.838 --> 01:17:25.740
a target fish that's becoming
depleted to the point

01:17:25.742 --> 01:17:28.376
of near extinction,
but they're also eating

01:17:28.378 --> 01:17:31.379
baggage comes with it,
and typically it requires

01:17:31.381 --> 01:17:35.750
about five to twenty
times more other seafood,

01:17:35.752 --> 01:17:39.887
as by-kill, and
by-kill is the term

01:17:39.889 --> 01:17:42.390
that relates to all
those other sea life,

01:17:42.392 --> 01:17:45.760
living in the ocean that
are killed in the process

01:17:45.762 --> 01:17:48.396
of trying to get that
target fish to your plate,

01:17:48.398 --> 01:17:51.399
whether it's with purse
seine type of fishing method,

01:17:51.401 --> 01:17:54.368
or long line or bottom
trawling, or middle trawling,

01:17:54.370 --> 01:17:57.271
our oceans are expected
to be completely

01:17:57.273 --> 01:17:59.807
devoid of all fish
that we recognize

01:17:59.809 --> 01:18:02.109
commercially today
by the year 2048.

01:18:02.111 --> 01:18:04.011
- The oceans are
dying, and nobody wants

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:05.413
to know about it.

01:18:05.415 --> 01:18:06.814
And if the oceans die, we die.

01:18:06.816 --> 01:18:07.848
It's as simple as that.

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:09.917
And if you start
destroying them,

01:18:09.919 --> 01:18:11.318
you're basically
killing out the crew,

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:12.853
and the life support
systems going to collapse,

01:18:12.855 --> 01:18:14.088
and there won't be
any air to breathe,

01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:15.356
and there won't be
any food to eat,

01:18:15.358 --> 01:18:16.157
and the climate'll
be out of control,

01:18:16.159 --> 01:18:18.292
and, not a good thing.

01:18:18.294 --> 01:18:20.261
But we have to humble
ourselves and recognize

01:18:20.263 --> 01:18:23.864
that we need this diversity,
we need these creatures,

01:18:23.866 --> 01:18:26.167
we need this interdependence,
and if we don't see that,

01:18:26.169 --> 01:18:29.770
then our chances of
survival are quite slim.

01:18:29.772 --> 01:18:31.472
My big concern is not
that we're going to wipe

01:18:31.474 --> 01:18:34.008
ourselves out, out of
sheer ecological stupidity,

01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:36.444
but that we're going to
take so much with us.

01:18:39.347 --> 01:18:41.916
- So much confusion,
and so much debate.

01:18:43.018 --> 01:18:44.885
That it just boggles
my mind that we can't

01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:46.787
think like third graders,
and say, "why not

01:18:46.789 --> 01:18:48.989
"just address the
number one cause here."

01:18:50.492 --> 01:18:53.027
You know, we got ten
holes in the boat,

01:18:53.029 --> 01:18:55.496
the boat's sinking, which
hole do we fill first?

01:18:55.498 --> 01:18:56.964
Go to the big hole.

01:18:56.966 --> 01:18:59.467
Fill that big hole first.

01:18:59.469 --> 01:19:01.035
- I mean, so often we're
looking at just what

01:19:01.037 --> 01:19:02.837
we would like to eat,
because it satisfies

01:19:02.839 --> 01:19:04.772
our taste preferences.

01:19:04.774 --> 01:19:05.940
Well, we're at a point in time,

01:19:05.942 --> 01:19:08.476
in order to save
humanity essentially,

01:19:08.478 --> 01:19:11.212
save our species, which
is not an overstatement

01:19:11.214 --> 01:19:14.982
at all, we need to start
looking outside of self,

01:19:14.984 --> 01:19:17.084
and start looking at how
our choices are fully

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:19.053
effecting those around
us, those species

01:19:19.055 --> 01:19:21.288
that we share this planet with,

01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:23.057
and especially
future generations.

01:19:27.362 --> 01:19:28.763
- A couple
years back, I saw

01:19:28.765 --> 01:19:31.265
a documentary
called, earthlings,

01:19:31.267 --> 01:19:33.033
that exposed the
conditions in which

01:19:33.035 --> 01:19:35.803
farm animals are slaughtered.

01:19:35.805 --> 01:19:37.938
It made a big impact on me.

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:40.207
I knew that animals
got killed for food,

01:19:40.209 --> 01:19:42.276
but seeing how it
actually happened,

01:19:42.278 --> 01:19:45.513
and seeing the suffering,
pain and terror

01:19:45.515 --> 01:19:47.414
that these animals go through,

01:19:47.416 --> 01:19:49.950
put things into a new
perspective for me.

01:19:49.952 --> 01:19:52.319
I was already eating
mostly plant-based foods

01:19:52.321 --> 01:19:55.322
at the time, but after
seeing those images,

01:19:55.324 --> 01:19:57.925
I decided I could not
contribute to the killing

01:19:57.927 --> 01:20:00.394
of innocent animals any longer.

01:20:00.396 --> 01:20:03.531
So I became a 100% plant eater.

01:20:03.533 --> 01:20:06.200
I was not in a position
to judge anybody,

01:20:06.202 --> 01:20:09.904
after all, I ate animals for
over 30 years of my life.

01:20:10.872 --> 01:20:12.406
But I wanted to understand,

01:20:12.408 --> 01:20:14.341
how come in this day and age,

01:20:14.343 --> 01:20:17.011
such a massive
genocide was allowed.

01:20:17.013 --> 01:20:18.879
And how come us, the
general population,

01:20:18.881 --> 01:20:22.116
government and
corporations allowed

01:20:22.118 --> 01:20:23.551
for this to happen?

01:20:33.929 --> 01:20:36.931
- We love some
animals, and eat others

01:20:36.933 --> 01:20:41.468
because we have been
born into a invisible

01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:43.337
belief system that conditions us

01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:46.540
to compartmentalize when
it comes to animals.

01:20:46.542 --> 01:20:48.008
It conditions us to
think of certain animals

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:51.111
as edible, and other
animals as inedible.

01:20:51.113 --> 01:20:53.981
And the invisible belief
system that conditions

01:20:53.983 --> 01:20:56.951
us to eat certain animals,
is what I call carnism.

01:20:56.953 --> 01:21:00.087
One way carnism
remains invisible, is
by remaining unnamed.

01:21:00.089 --> 01:21:02.022
If we don't name it, we
can't even think about it,

01:21:02.024 --> 01:21:04.024
so we can't question it.

01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:05.492
When we don't see
something, obviously,

01:21:05.494 --> 01:21:07.595
it becomes much
easier to maintain

01:21:07.597 --> 01:21:10.898
this mythology that
there is no problem,

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:12.199
there is no atrocity.

01:21:14.069 --> 01:21:16.437
- This is not
just something to eat.

01:21:16.439 --> 01:21:18.939
This is beautiful love,

01:21:18.941 --> 01:21:21.308
joy, work, action.

01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:24.345
This is life.

01:21:29.351 --> 01:21:30.951
- You're think
they're just animals?

01:21:30.953 --> 01:21:32.219
They have intelligence.

01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:35.022
They have language signal.

01:21:35.024 --> 01:21:36.423
They have love.

01:21:36.425 --> 01:21:38.092
So when they are
about to face deaths,

01:21:38.094 --> 01:21:39.660
in a death chamber,

01:21:39.662 --> 01:21:42.563
they fear, and they
sad, and they anger.

01:21:42.565 --> 01:21:44.365
- You know, everybody
talks about the holocaust,

01:21:44.367 --> 01:21:47.534
what about the holocaust we're
creating for the animals?

01:21:49.104 --> 01:21:49.103
Every year, we're killing
billions and billions

01:21:49.105 --> 01:21:53.340
of animals, and you
want peace on earth?

01:21:54.509 --> 01:21:57.144
Peace on earth is for
all living entities,

01:21:58.013 --> 01:21:59.513
not just humans.

01:22:04.019 --> 01:22:05.653
People just got
locked up in Utah

01:22:05.655 --> 01:22:08.656
for photographing a
cafo, a concentrated

01:22:08.658 --> 01:22:11.058
animal feeding operation.

01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:14.295
These people keeping
the people ignorant,

01:22:14.297 --> 01:22:16.597
and it's sick, to make money.

01:22:16.599 --> 01:22:18.132
And if the truth gets
out, if people know

01:22:18.134 --> 01:22:19.400
where their food came from,

01:22:19.402 --> 01:22:21.936
or how their food was produced,

01:22:21.938 --> 01:22:23.704
they wouldn't eat that shit.

01:22:23.706 --> 01:22:25.539
- When you start to
threaten the dominant

01:22:25.541 --> 01:22:29.209
paradigm of society,
you're going to become

01:22:29.211 --> 01:22:32.046
a force to be reckoned
with, and they'll do

01:22:32.048 --> 01:22:34.715
everything they
can to destroy you.

01:22:34.717 --> 01:22:36.984
And that's exactly,
that's happening now.

01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:03.410
- There are still
people who'll see that,

01:23:03.412 --> 01:23:05.412
and they'll be resistant,
i mean, I was one

01:23:05.414 --> 01:23:07.681
of those people, you
know, I grew up in Texas,

01:23:07.683 --> 01:23:11.051
eating beef all the time,
and I loved animals,

01:23:11.053 --> 01:23:12.519
I always loved the
companion animals

01:23:12.521 --> 01:23:14.688
I grew up with, and
you know, I never

01:23:14.690 --> 01:23:17.491
really thought much, i
thought I was eating healthy.

01:23:17.493 --> 01:23:19.526
So I think a lot of the
resistance that people feel is

01:23:19.528 --> 01:23:22.096
because we're so conditioned
to eat these things

01:23:22.098 --> 01:23:25.199
all the time, we've
been conditioned from
a very young age.

01:23:25.201 --> 01:23:26.667
- And even if we make the
intellectual connection,

01:23:26.669 --> 01:23:29.069
even if we say, "yes,
I'm eating a cow."

01:23:29.071 --> 01:23:31.238
We still don't make the
emotional connection,

01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:34.108
because if we did, we
would feel the empathy

01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:36.710
that would cause us
to feel disgusted

01:23:36.712 --> 01:23:39.213
rather than appetized.

01:23:39.215 --> 01:23:41.081
- I couldn't pretend anymore

01:23:41.083 --> 01:23:44.451
that was, eating that
chunk of chicken breast

01:23:44.453 --> 01:23:46.587
was the same as the
broccoli next to it,

01:23:46.589 --> 01:23:49.223
it just didn't, I couldn't,
i couldn't fake it

01:23:49.225 --> 01:23:51.225
to myself anymore.

01:23:51.227 --> 01:23:52.393
- And there's a
reason why, you know,

01:23:52.395 --> 01:23:54.628
slaughter houses,
and feed lots are not

01:23:54.630 --> 01:23:57.398
located in densely
populated areas.

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.433
It's not for lack of
space, it's because people

01:23:59.435 --> 01:24:02.169
don't want us to see it.

01:24:02.171 --> 01:24:04.271
Then those animals
go on a long journey

01:24:04.273 --> 01:24:06.440
to the slaughter house,
at night, usually.

01:24:06.442 --> 01:24:09.243
So we don't see a lot of
that, and that's by design.

01:24:09.245 --> 01:24:11.278
- Who's to say which
animals are to be tortured,

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:12.813
and killed?

01:24:12.815 --> 01:24:14.581
We've decided in America,
in our part of the world,

01:24:14.583 --> 01:24:18.252
cows and pigs, and
lambs are to be eaten,

01:24:18.254 --> 01:24:20.154
but in some parts of
the world, they eat dogs

01:24:20.156 --> 01:24:21.588
and cats, and in some
parts of the world

01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:23.290
they eat snakes and monkeys.

01:24:23.292 --> 01:24:25.159
- Yes, it's true that
people have eaten animals

01:24:25.161 --> 01:24:28.262
for thousands of
years, but today,

01:24:28.264 --> 01:24:30.264
for many people in the world,

01:24:30.266 --> 01:24:33.267
there's absolutely no
need to eat animals.

01:24:33.269 --> 01:24:36.103
You know, we are
causing, as human beings,

01:24:36.105 --> 01:24:40.307
massive suffering, to
other sentient beings,

01:24:40.309 --> 01:24:44.278
suffering that is
completely unnecessary.

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:46.313
When eating animals is
no longer a necessity

01:24:46.315 --> 01:24:48.549
for survival, then
it becomes a choice.

01:24:48.551 --> 01:24:50.818
And choices always
stem from beliefs.

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.321
- There is a
popular myth that perpetuates

01:24:54.323 --> 01:24:57.324
the idea that fish
don't feel any pain.

01:24:58.226 --> 01:25:00.227
That makes it easier for
people to consume it,

01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:02.696
since it seems to
be more humane.

01:25:03.465 --> 01:25:05.566
But, is it really true?

01:25:08.336 --> 01:25:10.471
- Fish have proprioception,
they have feelings.

01:25:10.473 --> 01:25:12.372
And so there are a
number of researchers

01:25:12.374 --> 01:25:15.609
that would tell you very
clearly that it's a very

01:25:15.611 --> 01:25:17.878
uncompassionate way to
eat, you're slaughtering

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:20.481
between one and three
trillion fish per year,

01:25:20.483 --> 01:25:23.784
and all of those fish
have sensory reception,

01:25:23.786 --> 01:25:25.452
they all have feelings.

01:25:25.454 --> 01:25:28.288
- The industries
depend on keeping these

01:25:28.290 --> 01:25:30.257
facts out of our consciousness.

01:25:30.259 --> 01:25:31.592
So for example,
we learn to resist

01:25:31.594 --> 01:25:34.528
taking in information
from those who

01:25:34.530 --> 01:25:38.198
may help us begin
to question carnism.

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:39.600
If you shoot the
messenger, you don't have

01:25:39.602 --> 01:25:42.669
to take seriously the
implications of their message.

01:25:42.671 --> 01:25:44.872
- So we need to
educate our children

01:25:44.874 --> 01:25:47.241
the true meaning of
what these animals

01:25:47.243 --> 01:25:51.512
really are, by showing,
and by awareness about life

01:25:51.514 --> 01:25:54.381
of the pig or chicken is
very much same as life

01:25:54.383 --> 01:25:55.516
of cat and dog.

01:26:11.299 --> 01:26:14.301
- Our time on
this planet is very short.

01:26:14.303 --> 01:26:16.904
And change can
sometimes be difficult.

01:26:16.906 --> 01:26:18.438
And slow.

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:20.674
But by taking the right steps,

01:26:20.676 --> 01:26:23.877
we can point ourselves
into a better direction.

01:26:25.246 --> 01:26:28.382
As for myself, this was
the most exciting journey

01:26:28.384 --> 01:26:29.583
I ever took.

01:26:29.585 --> 01:26:31.418
And I look forward
to continue living

01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:34.888
a healthy, plant-based
lifestyle with my family.

01:26:34.890 --> 01:26:37.291
And to keep empowering others

01:26:37.293 --> 01:26:38.392
with this information.

01:26:43.264 --> 01:26:45.199
- It's so important for us
to take care of ourselves.

01:26:45.201 --> 01:26:46.800
For our own human
health standpoint,

01:26:46.802 --> 01:26:49.369
but it really won't
matter how healthy we are

01:26:49.371 --> 01:26:50.904
if our planet isn't healthy.

01:26:52.207 --> 01:26:54.308
- You know what's
unique about us?

01:26:56.477 --> 01:26:59.346
We are the only species
out of the millions

01:27:00.348 --> 01:27:02.482
that does not live in
Harmony with nature.

01:27:03.618 --> 01:27:04.885
- At least it's good
to educate yourself

01:27:04.887 --> 01:27:06.320
and be aware, and
then you can make

01:27:06.322 --> 01:27:07.521
the decision from there,

01:27:07.523 --> 01:27:08.322
because ultimately,
it's your choice

01:27:08.324 --> 01:27:09.556
to make, you know.

01:27:09.558 --> 01:27:11.391
It's not like, "hey, you
know, you're the worse

01:27:11.393 --> 01:27:12.893
"person if you don't do this."

01:27:12.895 --> 01:27:15.462
No, it's not like that, but
at least educate yourself,

01:27:15.464 --> 01:27:18.265
find out, you know, so
at least you just know.

01:27:18.267 --> 01:27:20.834
I mean, you can make
the choices on your own.

01:27:20.836 --> 01:27:23.637
- I don't believe there's
an evil cabal of doctors

01:27:23.639 --> 01:27:26.440
and government people,

01:27:26.442 --> 01:27:28.442
I believe there's
a system in place,

01:27:28.444 --> 01:27:31.411
and the world is so asleep,

01:27:31.413 --> 01:27:33.413
and they've
forgotten, intuitively

01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:34.982
that people just
follow the system

01:27:34.984 --> 01:27:38.285
without thinking,
without questioning,

01:27:38.287 --> 01:27:39.620
and it's because they're asleep.

01:27:39.622 --> 01:27:40.921
It's not because
they're stupid, it's not

01:27:40.923 --> 01:27:42.856
because they're not motivated.

01:27:42.858 --> 01:27:45.459
- I mean, it's really insanity
when you think about it.

01:27:45.461 --> 01:27:48.595
That we are sitting
here, in the modern day,

01:27:48.597 --> 01:27:50.764
and we've got to talk
about eating fruits

01:27:50.766 --> 01:27:51.999
and vegetables.

01:27:52.001 --> 01:27:53.734
You know, you go back
in any time in history,

01:27:53.736 --> 01:27:57.004
past, say the last 100, 200
years, and it was just like

01:27:57.006 --> 01:27:59.339
everyone was doing it.

01:27:59.341 --> 01:28:03.477
- If you want to be a
responsible steward of our

01:28:04.579 --> 01:28:06.446
precious planet, and
its' dwindling resources,

01:28:07.482 --> 01:28:09.683
eating a plant-based
diet really is

01:28:09.685 --> 01:28:11.485
the only solution.

01:28:11.487 --> 01:28:13.553
And by voting with your dollar,

01:28:13.555 --> 01:28:15.689
and eating a plant-based diet,

01:28:15.691 --> 01:28:18.892
you are saying no to
animal agriculture,

01:28:18.894 --> 01:28:21.461
and all the devastation,
all the havoc

01:28:21.463 --> 01:28:23.063
that it's wreaking
on our planet.

01:28:23.065 --> 01:28:25.499
- I think that every human being

01:28:27.302 --> 01:28:28.302
wants to do good.

01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:32.439
I think that every human being,

01:28:32.441 --> 01:28:35.909
in their core, wants
to do what's right.

01:28:38.046 --> 01:28:39.880
And I think that
if we look at it,

01:28:39.882 --> 01:28:42.382
and we say, "you know what?

01:28:42.384 --> 01:28:46.019
"What is it that I can do today,

01:28:46.021 --> 01:28:48.422
"to make the environment better,

01:28:48.424 --> 01:28:49.623
"to make my health better,

01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:54.494
"and to have
compassion for animals,

01:28:54.496 --> 01:28:56.363
"for our fellow creatures.

01:28:56.365 --> 01:28:58.498
"What is it that I can do today?

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:01.435
"I can start on the path
to a plant-based diet."
