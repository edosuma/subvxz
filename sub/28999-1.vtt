WEBVTT

02:16.919 --> 02:20.618
People never think about
the cruelty of the Bible,

02:20.662 --> 02:22.751
the violence.

02:25.493 --> 02:28.235
We teach children with hand
puppets and coloring books

02:28.278 --> 02:30.802
some of the bloodiest stories

02:30.846 --> 02:32.456
and then tell them

02:32.500 --> 02:35.590
that it all means
we should love each other.

02:36.243 --> 02:40.116
That's what some
would call a paradox.

02:42.597 --> 02:45.252
What does anyone who's
known that kind of violence

02:45.295 --> 02:47.776
understand about love?

02:52.128 --> 02:55.262
When Samson tied
300 foxes together

02:55.305 --> 02:57.786
and lit them on fire.

03:00.267 --> 03:04.793
Killed a thousand men
with a donkey jawbone.

03:04.836 --> 03:07.012
A thousand.

03:10.929 --> 03:15.020
Pushed a temple over
after his eyes were put out.

03:17.719 --> 03:20.635
'Course Samson
was the lucky one.

03:22.071 --> 03:25.683
In the end, he didn't have to
see the monster he became.

03:32.951 --> 03:35.171
A man can only see
so much darkness

03:35.215 --> 03:37.434
before he goes blind.

05:13.922 --> 05:16.228
Charlie boy!

05:31.374 --> 05:33.376
Who's this?

05:33.420 --> 05:36.684
- Oh, that's Bruce.
- Bruce?

05:39.904 --> 05:43.865
You know, they say food tastes
different on the outside, Bruce.

05:45.127 --> 05:47.172
What you say?

05:48.043 --> 05:49.827
Shit, I don't know.

05:49.871 --> 05:52.177
I try not to eat prison food
on the outside.

05:57.705 --> 05:58.967
Let's get the fuck out of here.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.936
Hey, Tara.

06:13.111 --> 06:14.025
Brad.

06:15.462 --> 06:18.029
What are you --
a produce manager now?

06:18.073 --> 06:20.684
I'm a whatever-needs-to-get-
done-around-here manager.

06:20.728 --> 06:21.990
Fruit ain't gonna stock itself.

06:22.033 --> 06:23.644
Oh, I hear that.

06:24.471 --> 06:28.344
So, did you hear
about Morgan's baby?

06:29.127 --> 06:31.478
We got a call she wanted
to deliver at home.

06:31.521 --> 06:34.176
Kid started coming out,
but it was breeched.

06:34.219 --> 06:37.005
We tried to turn it around.

06:37.048 --> 06:38.876
Yeah, she pushed it through,
though, but the head

06:38.920 --> 06:40.530
got caught up,

06:40.574 --> 06:43.707
squished like an avocado.

06:43.751 --> 06:45.535
Baby's fine now,
but it's got a...

06:45.579 --> 06:49.060
big ol' dent.

06:49.104 --> 06:50.279
Kinda looks like the baby's got

06:50.322 --> 06:52.455
a little ashtray
on its forehead.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.718
- Brad, just...
- Well, what?

06:54.762 --> 06:57.678
You know Morgan.
I thought you'd want to -- Oh!

07:00.115 --> 07:01.812
You sure you don't want
a bigger one of those?

07:01.856 --> 07:03.771
It's for Engels here.

07:03.814 --> 07:07.731
Keeps parking the patrol car
behind Sammy's to catnap.

07:07.775 --> 07:10.647
I told you -- I'm not napping.
I'm meditating.

07:10.691 --> 07:13.215
Anyway, I was telling your
daughter about Morgan's kid

07:13.258 --> 07:15.260
and how it looks like she's got
a little baby ashtray

07:15.304 --> 07:16.697
- on her face.
- That's great.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.438
- Baby ashtray face.
- Perfect, Brad.

07:18.481 --> 07:19.917
Right?

07:19.961 --> 07:21.919
What?

07:25.532 --> 07:27.969
Listen. Um...

07:28.578 --> 07:30.885
...your mother's cooking dinner
this Thursday.

07:30.928 --> 07:34.279
Be -- Be nice to see you there.

07:34.323 --> 07:36.064
Yeah.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.460
Well, he's always
welcome at the house.

07:40.503 --> 07:41.722
You know that.

07:41.765 --> 07:43.332
Yeah, I know.

07:44.899 --> 07:47.858
Honey, I just want you
to be happy.

07:49.251 --> 07:50.774
We're fine.

07:52.123 --> 07:54.256
Okay.

07:55.823 --> 07:57.041
Hey.

07:59.130 --> 08:01.611
Bye, Dad.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.140
So, uh...

08:09.184 --> 08:11.534
how about one for the deputy?

08:11.578 --> 08:13.710
No? Okay.

08:16.626 --> 08:19.194
Bye, Officers.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.639
You're home late.

09:12.682 --> 09:14.684
Yeah.

09:14.728 --> 09:16.556
Got caught up at Flynn's.

09:17.252 --> 09:20.081
Sal needed a lift again.

09:20.124 --> 09:22.779
Marlene read him the riot act
when you dropped him off?

09:23.954 --> 09:25.956
I did not stick around
to hear that.

09:32.006 --> 09:35.096
Pork chops were half price,
so I bought extra.

09:35.139 --> 09:37.315
Don't fill up on beer.

09:38.055 --> 09:40.231
What did you say?

09:42.712 --> 09:45.672
Nick.

09:45.715 --> 09:46.803
Mm.

09:46.847 --> 09:48.326
Come on.
I got dinner to make.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.372
Mm.

09:53.244 --> 09:54.985
The pork chops
are gonna be cold.

09:55.029 --> 09:56.596
Oh, yeah?

09:58.554 --> 10:01.165
I love cold pork chops.

10:04.473 --> 10:06.344
Mm.

12:22.350 --> 12:25.222
You guys are pretty close
with this Nick fella, huh?

12:26.876 --> 12:28.269
Were.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.750
Ah.

12:39.802 --> 12:42.152
Three of us...

12:43.675 --> 12:46.330
...we were gonna go
down to Mexico.

12:47.592 --> 12:49.246
Buy us an orange grove.

12:51.596 --> 12:55.949
Sit around, drinking tequila.

12:56.950 --> 13:00.649
Fucking señoritas while
the greasers picked them for us.

13:05.045 --> 13:08.004
- You know, Bruce...
- Huh?

13:08.048 --> 13:10.137
...if things work out...

13:11.181 --> 13:13.749
...you might be able
to come with.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.273
Yeah.

13:16.317 --> 13:18.319
That'd be, uh...

13:18.972 --> 13:20.538
That'd be real special.

13:22.627 --> 13:23.846
You know, not that it matters --

13:23.890 --> 13:26.240
I mean, the job's a job...

13:27.110 --> 13:29.069
...but, um...

13:30.157 --> 13:31.854
...what happened?

13:31.898 --> 13:34.814
Well, you know
what they say about plans.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.467
Yeah.

13:38.730 --> 13:40.820
Shit happens.

13:49.480 --> 13:50.742
Forchet?

13:54.398 --> 13:56.270
Good to put a face to the voice.

14:02.319 --> 14:03.538
You get it?

14:04.191 --> 14:05.453
About that.

14:05.496 --> 14:07.629
Yeah,
the man you're looking for,

14:07.672 --> 14:09.413
he isn't the easiest fella
to find.

14:13.374 --> 14:15.202
You get my address?

14:15.245 --> 14:18.945
More or less.
I got anaddress.

14:18.988 --> 14:21.208
But, uh... thing is,

14:21.251 --> 14:24.951
with travel expenses,

14:24.994 --> 14:27.692
2 grand's just not gonna cut it.

14:28.432 --> 14:30.739
We had a deal.

14:30.782 --> 14:33.133
That wasthe deal.

14:35.135 --> 14:37.615
I'm gonna need another 2 grand.

14:38.442 --> 14:40.575
Another 2 grand?

14:40.618 --> 14:42.490
Hmm.

14:43.143 --> 14:47.190
See, a man in prison

14:47.234 --> 14:50.193
pays you to find another man...

14:51.803 --> 14:53.718
...4 grand just feels right.

14:55.590 --> 14:59.507
I think I'm well within
my bounds to renegotiate.

15:00.987 --> 15:03.206
I don't got it.

15:06.818 --> 15:08.603
Well...

15:08.646 --> 15:11.388
you look like a resourceful man.

15:12.433 --> 15:13.477
I'll wait.

15:24.662 --> 15:27.274
That's $2,000.

15:29.580 --> 15:31.756
You take it.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.194
You give me that address.

15:37.501 --> 15:39.068
Well, I'll tell you what.

15:39.112 --> 15:41.244
I'm-a cut you a deal, alright?

15:41.288 --> 15:43.290
Aaaahhh!

15:43.333 --> 15:44.987
Motherfucker!

15:45.031 --> 15:46.467
We made a deal.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.773
Fuck!

15:48.817 --> 15:51.341
Give me the address.

15:51.385 --> 15:53.169
Give me it.

15:56.912 --> 15:58.000
Here.

15:58.044 --> 16:01.438
Let go. Ow.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.527
Aah, aah!

16:10.012 --> 16:13.189
Shit.

16:44.873 --> 16:46.222
Where to?

16:46.266 --> 16:48.224
Head toward 61.

17:19.733 --> 17:21.779
Fucking Marlene, man.

17:21.823 --> 17:22.911
What's that?

17:22.954 --> 17:24.739
Tuna.
That's what that is.

17:24.781 --> 17:28.176
- Yeah?
- Yeah, every damn day, man.

17:28.221 --> 17:30.179
I ask for something different,
what does she give me? Tuna.

17:30.223 --> 17:31.833
It's like
she's fucking with me, man.

17:31.876 --> 17:35.097
Like, Mexican tuna,
Japanese tuna...

17:35.141 --> 17:36.359
American tuna.
I don't know, man.

17:36.403 --> 17:37.708
- Hey, Sal!
- Yeah?

17:37.752 --> 17:39.275
I got a shift open this weekend.

17:39.319 --> 17:40.450
Are you interested?

17:41.930 --> 17:44.019
No, man. Can't do it. Working
on Jordan's cabin again.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.239
- We got rained out.
- Right, right, yeah.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.110
Building Noah's ark, right?
Mm-hmm.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.416
Enjoy that hunting trip.

17:49.459 --> 17:53.072
Oh, no. No, that's just work.
I swear.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.595
Alright.

17:54.638 --> 17:57.032
Don't be coming next week
begging for a shift

17:57.076 --> 17:59.991
'cause you got rained out.
You understand me?

18:01.732 --> 18:03.647
Yeah, boss.

18:04.866 --> 18:06.476
You can take that shift
if you want, man.

18:06.520 --> 18:09.218
I can work on the cabin myself.
Make it 50/50.

18:09.262 --> 18:10.741
No, man.

18:10.785 --> 18:13.266
Five days a week in this place
is enough for me.

18:13.309 --> 18:15.964
Besides, I want to go hunting.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.618
Hey, man, that reminds me.

18:17.661 --> 18:20.142
- John asked if he could come.
- What'd you tell him?

18:20.186 --> 18:21.535
No, I told him to fuck off, man.

18:21.578 --> 18:22.753
There's not enough room
in the truck.

18:22.797 --> 18:24.015
- Seriously?
- Yeah. If we go hunting,

18:24.059 --> 18:25.408
I don't want to deal with him.

18:25.452 --> 18:26.627
Did you tell him about your gun?

18:26.670 --> 18:28.542
- No.
- Why not?

18:28.585 --> 18:30.326
I owe him money, man.

18:55.525 --> 18:57.962
Frank, do you copy?

19:00.487 --> 19:02.271
Go ahead, Brad.

19:02.315 --> 19:03.620
Hey, I'm taking off.

19:03.664 --> 19:05.448
Garrett's on,
so I'll see you tomorrow.

19:05.492 --> 19:08.364
Copy that.
See you tomorrow.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.611
You make sure
Sal pays you back some

20:21.655 --> 20:23.483
when you get paid for this job.

20:24.571 --> 20:26.268
I will.

20:36.452 --> 20:38.106
What?

20:39.281 --> 20:41.370
You.

20:41.414 --> 20:44.373
Sometimes I think your mind's
a million miles away.

20:52.903 --> 20:54.340
You sure
you're gonna be alright,

20:54.383 --> 20:56.255
me being gone all weekend?

20:56.298 --> 20:57.778
Yeah, I'll be fine.

20:57.821 --> 20:59.693
I promise.

20:59.736 --> 21:02.565
Marlene might come over later,
maybe watch a movie...

21:02.609 --> 21:04.611
if she gets someone
to watch the kids.

21:04.654 --> 21:08.049
You got, um...
Jordan's number, right?

21:08.092 --> 21:10.704
- If you need to get in touch?
- I've got it taken care of.

21:10.747 --> 21:13.141
I will be fine.

21:13.184 --> 21:14.969
Go. Have fun.

21:28.809 --> 21:30.463
Something for the way up.

21:30.506 --> 21:32.421
Thanks, baby.

21:32.465 --> 21:34.162
You got enough food?

21:34.205 --> 21:36.033
Just what's in the cooler.

21:36.077 --> 21:38.993
Well, if you get some time,
bring them back full.

21:39.036 --> 21:40.821
Alright.

21:40.864 --> 21:44.433
I better go get Sal before
Marlene locks him in the house.

21:44.477 --> 21:46.000
Alright, love you.

21:46.043 --> 21:47.915
You too.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.521
You be back here by Sunday,

22:28.564 --> 22:31.567
- or I won't be.
- Yep. Yeah, yeah.

22:31.611 --> 22:33.656
Make sure you pay
attention when you're working.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.658
You can't fix chairs
if you're missing a finger.

22:35.702 --> 22:37.660
I know. I'm gonna try not to
poke an eye out either.

22:37.704 --> 22:39.227
Hey, you look at me.

22:39.270 --> 22:42.317
You're gonna be super-cool
to your mom, right?

22:42.361 --> 22:44.232
That's right. You help her out,
whatever she needs.

22:44.275 --> 22:47.148
And you. You're just --
You're perfect.

22:47.844 --> 22:49.933
- Yeah, you're alright.
- Mm.

22:49.977 --> 22:51.587
Feed her this time.

22:51.631 --> 22:54.155
Yeah, I'll make sure to do that.

22:54.198 --> 22:56.331
Okay. Alright, bye!

22:56.375 --> 22:58.768
Love you!
See you Sunday!

22:58.812 --> 23:01.684
Make sure he stays
out of trouble, Nick.

23:01.728 --> 23:03.686
- Will do.
- Bye.

23:14.175 --> 23:15.698
Oh, let's get the fuck
out of here.

23:15.742 --> 23:18.875
I don't know
how you guys do it, man.

23:18.919 --> 23:20.137
Hard liquor.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.122
Unh-unh.

23:48.165 --> 23:50.864
- We don't serve your kind here.
- Oh, yeah? What's that?

23:50.907 --> 23:53.344
- Smart, handsome men?
- JORDAN:

23:54.520 --> 23:56.173
You got the "men" part right.

23:56.217 --> 23:58.872
- How's it going, buddy?
- How's my cabin coming?

23:58.915 --> 24:01.701
I don't know. I guess we'll
see it when we get up there.

24:02.963 --> 24:04.355
How's it hanging, Sal?

24:04.399 --> 24:06.096
South.

24:06.140 --> 24:08.403
As always, man. Just don't
get up like it used to.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.449
Yeah, I hear you.

24:10.492 --> 24:11.537
What are you ladies drinking?

24:11.580 --> 24:13.713
Oh, anything cold.

24:17.673 --> 24:18.631
On the house.

24:18.674 --> 24:20.110
Hear, hear.

24:20.154 --> 24:22.069
Appreciate it.

24:22.896 --> 24:24.419
How Tara doing?

24:24.463 --> 24:27.814
Yeah, she's --
she's doing alright.

24:27.857 --> 24:29.206
Keeping busy.

24:29.250 --> 24:31.948
- How you doing?
- I'm alright.

24:31.992 --> 24:34.777
You still got
a phone back there?

24:34.821 --> 24:36.823
Yeah, come on back.

24:40.522 --> 24:42.785
Tell Tara I said "hello."

24:42.829 --> 24:44.831
Will do.

25:06.330 --> 25:08.507
Uh, hey, babe.

25:08.550 --> 25:11.945
It's me. We just, uh --
just got to Jordan's.

25:11.988 --> 25:14.425
We're about to head out
to the cabin in a little bit.

25:14.469 --> 25:16.297
Not sure where you are.
I --

25:16.340 --> 25:18.429
- Nick.
- Tara?

25:18.473 --> 25:20.606
Hey, sorry.
I was in the shower.

25:20.649 --> 25:22.085
I heard the machine cut on.

25:22.129 --> 25:23.826
It's alright.

25:23.870 --> 25:25.741
Yeah, we just made it out here
a little bit ago.

25:25.785 --> 25:27.787
Just sitting at Jordan's
having a couple.

25:27.830 --> 25:29.615
Oh.

25:29.658 --> 25:31.225
Having a couple.

25:32.835 --> 25:34.750
You be careful in the dark.

25:34.794 --> 25:36.622
Especially on those roads.

25:36.665 --> 25:38.188
I will.

25:38.232 --> 25:40.277
You eat dinner yet?

25:40.321 --> 25:41.931
Yeah.

25:41.975 --> 25:44.107
Finished the quiche.

25:44.151 --> 25:45.413
Oh, um...

25:45.456 --> 25:47.023
Jordan says "hi."

25:47.067 --> 25:49.373
That's sweet.
You tell him I said "hi" back.

25:49.417 --> 25:52.376
Yeah, I will.

25:52.420 --> 25:53.421
What was that?

25:53.464 --> 25:56.206
Oh, I'm making a pie.

25:56.816 --> 25:58.121
Okay.

25:58.165 --> 26:00.471
In case Marlene comes by.

26:00.515 --> 26:04.040
Speak of the devil.

26:05.172 --> 26:07.174
I gotta go.

26:07.217 --> 26:09.002
Alright.

26:09.045 --> 26:11.221
- I love you.
- Yeah, I love you, too.

26:11.265 --> 26:13.659
I'm coming!

26:13.702 --> 26:16.749
Hold on a goddamn moment,
Marlene.

26:22.929 --> 26:24.408
Hey, man, she left you yet?

26:26.367 --> 26:28.935
You tell her I said "hello"?

26:28.978 --> 26:30.371
Yep.

26:30.414 --> 26:32.329
She said "hi" back.

26:32.373 --> 26:34.288
You tell her I said "hi"?

26:34.331 --> 26:36.333
Hell no.

28:36.497 --> 28:39.108
What?

28:39.152 --> 28:42.895
Hey, man, you'd think I wouldn't
have to ask. You'd just tell me.

28:43.591 --> 28:46.072
This shit, man?

28:46.115 --> 28:48.204
That's a big motherfucker, man.
Looks like it hurt.

28:48.248 --> 28:51.425
Big-ass scar.

28:51.468 --> 28:52.818
Fell down.

28:52.861 --> 28:56.038
Fuck you, man.

28:56.082 --> 28:57.648
Yeah.

28:57.692 --> 29:01.348
Hey, I'm serious, though, man.

29:07.223 --> 29:10.618
I was just hanging out with
the wrong guys for a while.

29:11.793 --> 29:14.578
We were sort of like a...

29:14.622 --> 29:17.581
I don't know what you call it.

29:18.365 --> 29:21.890
Didn't add up to anything good,
that's for sure.

29:24.675 --> 29:26.852
The fuck kind of answer
is that, man?

29:30.377 --> 29:32.248
My dad and Jordan
went back quite a ways,

29:32.292 --> 29:35.164
and he's the one
that introduced me to Junior.

29:35.208 --> 29:38.907
I figured it was better to,
you know...

29:38.951 --> 29:42.650
start new somewhere
where I knew a couple people.

29:43.390 --> 29:45.827
Then I met Tara.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.786
That was it.
That sealed the deal.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.578
You married right
with that one, man.

29:58.622 --> 30:00.189
I mean, at least
your father-in-law

30:00.233 --> 30:01.756
can get you out of tickets.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.193
Mine just kicks me in the teeth.

30:04.237 --> 30:07.283
Yeah, well, we got something
in common on that one.

30:07.327 --> 30:09.982
- Want one?
- Yeah.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.558
I got one, too, you know?

30:21.602 --> 30:23.473
What's that?

30:24.692 --> 30:27.173
Check that out.
See that right there?

30:27.216 --> 30:28.783
Oh, shit.
Where'd you pick that up?

30:28.827 --> 30:31.090
- Marlene.
- Marlene?

30:31.133 --> 30:35.181
Actually,
that was her ex-husband.

30:35.224 --> 30:38.010
I mean, technically, it was
her husband at the time.

30:38.053 --> 30:40.055
Wait.
So you broke up a marriage?

30:40.099 --> 30:41.665
No, no, no.
Wait a minute.

30:41.709 --> 30:44.103
Wasn't like that, man.

30:44.146 --> 30:47.062
She had one foot
out of the door already.

30:47.106 --> 30:48.890
When she came
in the upholstery store,

30:48.934 --> 30:52.024
asked to have her recliner done,

30:52.067 --> 30:54.591
she was just radiating
that energy she has, man.

30:54.635 --> 30:57.856
I was done, man. Took one look
at her. That was it.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.336
Of course,
now that I think about it,

31:00.380 --> 31:02.121
getting her pregnant
before she was divorced

31:02.164 --> 31:03.949
probably sped some things up
a little bit, but...

31:05.907 --> 31:07.909
He didn't take too kindly
to that, and he came in

31:07.953 --> 31:10.607
and hit me in the head
with a tire iron one day.

31:11.391 --> 31:13.915
Yeah, yeah.
I was out for 20 minutes.

31:13.959 --> 31:15.917
Woke up.
About 15 stitches and...

31:15.961 --> 31:18.354
- No shit.
- I don't really remember much,

31:18.398 --> 31:20.966
but it's kinda fucked up,
if you ask me.

31:23.664 --> 31:26.972
Marlene and I got married
a few weeks later.

31:30.018 --> 31:32.934
And she's been around
ever since.

31:32.978 --> 31:35.806
What happened to the husband?

31:35.850 --> 31:37.765
He went inside
for about four months.

31:39.071 --> 31:41.725
Got married in prison, actually.

31:41.769 --> 31:44.337
So I don't feel too bad.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.775
Hey, man.

31:47.818 --> 31:50.386
Here's to finding the one
that'll fuck you rotten

31:50.430 --> 31:52.214
and then cook you
breakfast afterwards.

31:52.258 --> 31:54.173
She fucks you rotten, huh?

31:55.000 --> 31:58.568
No, not really, man,
but one out of two ain't bad.

31:58.612 --> 32:01.441
Yeah.

33:51.507 --> 33:53.379
Afternoon.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.993
How's it coming?

34:00.777 --> 34:04.477
We're gonna need another weekend
at it, but it's coming along.

34:04.520 --> 34:07.001
- What you got there?
- Popped a couple doves.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.742
I thought you might
want to smoke some.

34:10.178 --> 34:11.484
Oh, man.

34:11.527 --> 34:13.877
Speaking to my soul now.

34:14.617 --> 34:17.141
Hey, can I use your phone again?

34:17.185 --> 34:19.534
Yeah, of course.
Come on.

35:10.804 --> 35:12.414
I want marshmallows!

35:12.458 --> 35:14.416
No more marshmallows for you.

35:14.460 --> 35:16.375
- It's too much sugar.
- Just one?

35:16.418 --> 35:17.724
No, ma'am.
You are not...

35:21.554 --> 35:22.816
Hi.
You've reached the Porters.

35:22.859 --> 35:24.209
We're not home right now.

35:24.252 --> 35:25.993
So if you could
please leave a message,

35:26.036 --> 35:27.647
we'll get back to you
as soon as possible. Okay?

35:27.690 --> 35:28.996
Hey, Nick.

35:29.039 --> 35:30.867
Come on, man. Damn.

35:30.911 --> 35:32.608
Marlene's gonna whup my ass
if I'm late.

35:32.652 --> 35:34.480
Come on, man.
Let's go.

35:34.523 --> 35:37.135
Yeah.
Yeah, let's hit the road.

35:37.178 --> 35:39.093
Yeah.

35:41.095 --> 35:42.531
I just called your place.

35:42.575 --> 35:44.838
Nobody answered.

35:44.881 --> 35:46.013
No?

35:46.056 --> 35:48.102
Nobody?

35:48.146 --> 35:51.758
Well, she usually gives them
a bath right about now.

35:51.801 --> 35:53.803
Who knows?
Maybe she's drowning them.

35:53.847 --> 35:56.154
Might have finally cracked.

36:30.318 --> 36:32.712
Alright, man.
Tomorrow morning.

36:32.755 --> 36:34.540
Yup.

38:46.585 --> 38:49.544
- Aah!
- Whoa, whoa!

38:49.588 --> 38:52.112
- Damn it!
- Put it down, Nick.

38:52.155 --> 38:53.635
- Fuck!
- Put it down.

38:53.679 --> 38:55.333
He shot me!

38:55.376 --> 38:56.769
- Fuck.
- He did.

38:58.814 --> 39:01.948
Put it down.
Put it down.

39:01.991 --> 39:03.950
Nick.

39:05.299 --> 39:06.953
Fuck!

39:06.996 --> 39:07.954
Aah!

39:07.997 --> 39:10.130
She drew on us first, Nick.

39:10.173 --> 39:12.262
It's the truth.

39:13.786 --> 39:15.440
Just take a load off, son.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.725
That's for breaking my heart.

39:41.291 --> 39:42.336
And Charlie's.

39:48.516 --> 39:51.867
Ah, but that's in the past now.
It's...

39:52.781 --> 39:55.915
It is so good to see you, Nick.

39:56.568 --> 39:59.222
I got a question for you,
though.

40:00.963 --> 40:02.530
You got any ice cream?

40:02.574 --> 40:04.576
Hmm?

40:04.619 --> 40:06.186
I mean, initially,
when we came in,

40:06.229 --> 40:08.188
the little lady,
the missus was making a pie,

40:08.231 --> 40:10.364
and we got it
back in the fridge.

40:11.626 --> 40:15.413
I mean,
doesn't that sound normal?

40:15.456 --> 40:17.806
Pie and ice cream?

40:17.850 --> 40:20.156
- Yep.
- SLOAN:

40:22.028 --> 40:24.509
You wouldn't happen to have
any butter pecan, would you?

40:24.552 --> 40:26.641
Nick?

40:27.425 --> 40:29.731
Go see if he's got
any ice cream.

40:29.775 --> 40:32.430
Seriously?
I'm fucking bleeding out here.

40:33.169 --> 40:35.258
I gotta get this looked at.

40:43.571 --> 40:44.703
What'd you think
you were gonna do?

40:44.746 --> 40:45.791
You were gonna put on a mask

40:45.834 --> 40:48.271
and make believe
you were normal?

40:48.315 --> 40:49.621
Hmm?

40:50.317 --> 40:52.667
It wasn't gonna catch up to you?

41:02.808 --> 41:04.505
You killed her

41:04.549 --> 41:06.725
the minute you put that ring
on her little finger.

41:15.690 --> 41:17.953
It's kind of ironic,
isn't it, Charlie?

41:17.997 --> 41:20.260
That's what I'd call it, yeah.

41:21.435 --> 41:23.306
Nicholas...

41:23.916 --> 41:26.571
...we're the only family
you got.

41:27.267 --> 41:30.400
We're the only ones
who will ever understand you

41:30.444 --> 41:34.056
for what you are.

41:34.100 --> 41:38.321
We were a fucking family.

41:39.671 --> 41:42.412
And you tried to kill us.

41:45.111 --> 41:47.287
It's actually pretty funny.

41:48.767 --> 41:50.551
They actually have butter pecan.

41:50.595 --> 41:52.771
Hey, hey, Bruce...

41:52.814 --> 41:53.859
shut up.

42:02.998 --> 42:04.434
When we first showed up, man,

42:04.478 --> 42:05.871
we were here for, what,
two days?

42:05.914 --> 42:09.004
We were here, talking.
Talking about...

42:09.048 --> 42:10.615
about the weather

42:10.658 --> 42:12.704
and all kinds of shit
with the little lady, with Tara.

42:12.747 --> 42:15.402
Tara is her name, right?

42:17.360 --> 42:19.493
Washer name.

42:20.102 --> 42:22.191
Man, you should've seen her.

42:22.235 --> 42:23.932
She wouldn't shut the fuck up,
man.

42:23.976 --> 42:26.413
She was asking us
all kinds of questions.

42:26.456 --> 42:28.154
Real inquisitive.

42:29.634 --> 42:32.550
And then she told us
about the money.

42:33.246 --> 42:37.729
Imagine that. She told us
that you said that you, uh...

42:37.772 --> 42:40.558
you inherited the money.

42:40.601 --> 42:42.951
Who the fuck is leaving you
any money?

42:43.648 --> 42:44.823
Who does that to their wife?

42:44.866 --> 42:46.128
Who lies to their wife
like that?

42:46.172 --> 42:48.957
What kind of man does that,
Nick?

42:50.742 --> 42:54.006
Did you use our money
to buy this place, Nick?

42:54.746 --> 42:56.617
Because that's what she told us.

42:58.184 --> 43:00.142
Shit.

43:02.014 --> 43:03.363
Doesn't matter.

43:04.538 --> 43:06.496
Doesn't matter anymore.

43:06.540 --> 43:08.281
You should've
just fucking come to us.

43:10.283 --> 43:11.284
Hey!

43:11.327 --> 43:12.285
God damn it, Bruce!

43:12.328 --> 43:13.460
Fucking lunged at him!

43:14.679 --> 43:15.810
He lunged at you.

43:17.029 --> 43:18.204
Nick.

43:18.247 --> 43:20.598
Oh, fuck.

43:24.210 --> 43:26.299
Nick.

43:26.908 --> 43:28.780
Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick.

43:30.825 --> 43:33.480
Now, boy...

43:34.612 --> 43:36.918
...I guess this is
what you'd call closure.

44:07.993 --> 44:10.082
Nick, I'm sorry.

46:34.661 --> 46:36.184
Bastard.

46:53.288 --> 46:56.465
Come on. Come on.

46:56.509 --> 46:58.206
Come on.

46:58.859 --> 47:00.078
Come on.

48:20.288 --> 48:23.596
Dr. Hobbs, call Cancer Research.

48:23.726 --> 48:26.555
Dr. Hobbs, call Cancel Research.

48:33.040 --> 48:35.086
Don't struggle.

48:37.088 --> 48:39.394
Hm.

48:40.091 --> 48:42.267
How long have I been here?

48:46.271 --> 48:49.056
I always knew
you were trouble, Nick.

48:53.017 --> 48:55.497
I shouldn't have left.

49:03.288 --> 49:06.552
I told you to stay away
from my daughter.

49:09.816 --> 49:11.861
But you didn't.

49:14.647 --> 49:17.955
Told her not to marry you,
but she did.

49:18.956 --> 49:22.611
Said I didn't know you
like she did.

49:24.962 --> 49:29.531
But I knew exactly
what you were, didn't I?

49:32.839 --> 49:35.189
Now I'm sitting here...

49:36.538 --> 49:38.627
...wondering...

49:40.542 --> 49:44.982
...why I shouldn't take my gun
and just...

49:47.332 --> 49:49.682
Who do you think did this?

49:49.725 --> 49:51.901
Don't push me, Nick.

49:54.687 --> 49:57.168
You gotta let me go.

49:57.211 --> 50:00.519
You think I would do
something like this?

50:05.654 --> 50:07.874
I know you were hunting
with Sal.

50:10.094 --> 50:13.053
The coroner told me that...

50:15.838 --> 50:18.015
...that she'd been dead
for two days.

50:21.496 --> 50:24.760
I know you didn't
pull the trigger.

50:25.805 --> 50:28.634
But you know who did.

50:28.677 --> 50:30.505
Don't you?

50:33.987 --> 50:35.597
Yeah.

50:35.641 --> 50:38.383
And I'll handle it
if you let me go.

50:39.732 --> 50:42.691
Well, that's not the way
we do things around here, son.

51:30.174 --> 51:32.089
Where you going?

51:33.264 --> 51:35.570
I can't be here right now.

51:36.223 --> 51:39.139
But you let me know
the second he wakes up.

51:39.183 --> 51:41.359
- Sure. Why would --
- Brad.

51:41.402 --> 51:43.839
I'll be back in a few.

51:43.883 --> 51:47.234
But for now, you just watch him
like a fucking hawk.

54:52.071 --> 54:53.638
Well, look at that.

54:53.681 --> 54:56.510
He's awake.

54:57.468 --> 55:00.122
How's your chest?

55:00.166 --> 55:02.081
Hurts, don't it?

55:05.824 --> 55:08.217
Would you mind?

55:08.261 --> 55:10.089
What?

55:10.742 --> 55:12.352
Drink.

55:12.396 --> 55:14.049
Thirsty.

55:33.895 --> 55:36.115
Oh, okay.

55:36.898 --> 55:37.856
Oh, alright.

55:40.206 --> 55:41.816
Ugh!

55:41.860 --> 55:44.123
Hey, you okay?

55:44.166 --> 55:46.734
Hey, you alright?

55:46.778 --> 55:48.127
Nick? Nick?

55:48.170 --> 55:49.781
Hey.

57:36.235 --> 57:38.629
Dr. Wesley to Imaging.

57:38.759 --> 57:40.935
Dr. Wesley to Imaging.

59:04.671 --> 59:05.890
Hey.

59:08.806 --> 59:10.721
How you doing?

59:15.639 --> 59:17.989
I'm gonna go for a smoke.

59:18.642 --> 59:19.556
Sal.

59:21.514 --> 59:23.037
I'm okay.

59:23.081 --> 59:25.170
Promise.

59:36.877 --> 59:40.446
Jesus fucking Christ, man.

59:40.489 --> 59:42.056
Nick?

59:42.666 --> 59:44.798
Oh, what the fuck?

59:46.147 --> 59:47.540
Nick.

59:47.584 --> 59:50.717
What the fuck
happened to you, man?

59:50.761 --> 59:52.414
Where you been?

59:53.154 --> 59:55.548
They had me at the hospital.

59:55.592 --> 59:58.029
In the hospital?

59:58.072 --> 01:00:00.988
No, man.
I went there, and...

01:00:01.032 --> 01:00:02.555
cop says you weren't there, man.

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:04.209
You alright?

01:00:04.252 --> 01:00:06.037
Yeah.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.735
Oh, shit, man.
I'm so sorry.

01:00:13.522 --> 01:00:15.002
I heard about Tara.

01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:17.744
What'd you hear?

01:00:23.228 --> 01:00:25.056
People be trying to say
that you killed her, man,

01:00:25.099 --> 01:00:27.145
but I know that's bullshit, man.

01:00:27.188 --> 01:00:29.451
Hey, look at me.
I know that's bullshit.

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:33.760
You know who did it?

01:00:33.804 --> 01:00:36.284
Yeah, I know.
I need your help.

01:00:39.374 --> 01:00:41.028
Alright.

01:00:41.855 --> 01:00:43.552
I need you
to help me hide this car,

01:00:43.596 --> 01:00:46.120
- and I need to borrow your van.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:00:46.164 --> 01:00:47.687
Anything you need, man.

01:00:47.731 --> 01:00:50.429
- But I'm gonna go with you.
- No.

01:00:50.472 --> 01:00:53.388
I can't let you do that, Sal.

01:00:54.128 --> 01:00:56.000
I can't let you get involved
with this.

01:00:56.043 --> 01:00:57.436
I'm already involved here.

01:00:57.479 --> 01:01:00.178
You're asking me to hide
a police car in my yard.

01:01:00.221 --> 01:01:03.050
- No, no.
- Hey.

01:01:04.356 --> 01:01:05.923
Look at you, man.

01:01:06.793 --> 01:01:09.187
I'm not letting you
do this alone.

01:01:12.059 --> 01:01:14.975
You wanna stop talking about it
and go do this thing?

01:01:31.209 --> 01:01:33.298
I don't like this, Sal.

01:01:33.341 --> 01:01:35.213
I don't like this one bit.

01:01:35.909 --> 01:01:38.303
Just remember what to say
if they come asking.

01:01:38.346 --> 01:01:40.827
I don't think
you should do this.

01:01:40.871 --> 01:01:43.612
He'd do the same thing
for us, okay?

01:01:54.058 --> 01:01:56.364
I'm really sorry, Nick.

01:02:00.455 --> 01:02:03.850
- Leave the light on for us.
- Okay.

01:02:10.509 --> 01:02:13.599
Don't get yourself
in trouble, Sal.

01:02:45.065 --> 01:02:47.938
- God damn it.
- I'm sorry, Frank.

01:02:47.981 --> 01:02:50.201
God damn it!

01:02:56.424 --> 01:02:58.644
You get back over to his house.

01:02:58.687 --> 01:03:02.126
You arrest anybody that comes
within 50 yards of that place.

01:03:02.169 --> 01:03:03.823
And you radio me right away
if you do.

01:03:03.867 --> 01:03:06.217
- You got that?
- Yes, sir.

01:03:33.897 --> 01:03:35.986
Keep it running.

01:04:25.818 --> 01:04:27.820
What's up, man?

01:04:29.213 --> 01:04:30.910
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

01:04:36.089 --> 01:04:38.352
You wanna try that place off 90?

01:04:39.049 --> 01:04:40.354
Yeah.

01:04:40.398 --> 01:04:41.965
Yeah?

01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:33.016
Hold on a minute.

01:05:39.674 --> 01:05:41.328
May I help you?

01:05:42.155 --> 01:05:44.331
I'm looking for someone.

01:05:45.593 --> 01:05:48.596
- Someone?
- Three men.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:52.035
They would have stayed here
over the weekend.

01:05:52.078 --> 01:05:53.993
Driving a green Cadillac.

01:05:55.603 --> 01:05:57.344
They would've paid in cash.

01:05:58.084 --> 01:06:00.304
Stayed in room 102.

01:06:01.479 --> 01:06:03.437
Who'd you say you were?

01:06:06.832 --> 01:06:08.965
Brad Engels.

01:06:10.227 --> 01:06:11.968
Sheriff's department.

01:06:19.888 --> 01:06:22.630
Alright, let me check real fast.

01:06:24.284 --> 01:06:26.330
102.

01:06:27.679 --> 01:06:31.335
Ford. Walter Ford.

01:06:32.162 --> 01:06:34.164
That's the name he gave me.

01:06:34.207 --> 01:06:35.992
They still here?

01:06:36.035 --> 01:06:37.950
They were here a few nights.

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:41.867
They came and went a few times.

01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:44.609
They left this afternoon.

01:06:44.652 --> 01:06:46.567
You rent out that room yet?

01:06:46.611 --> 01:06:48.917
No.

01:06:48.961 --> 01:06:51.268
Let me in that room.

01:07:18.295 --> 01:07:20.036
Yeah?

01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:23.604
Yeah.

01:07:24.562 --> 01:07:26.781
102.

01:08:57.002 --> 01:08:58.960
What are we looking for, man?

01:09:02.006 --> 01:09:03.835
I don't know.

01:09:10.276 --> 01:09:11.669
Yeah, I think they're long gone.

01:09:50.490 --> 01:09:51.796
All units, we have shots fired

01:09:51.839 --> 01:09:54.320
at the Hiway Host Motel.

01:09:55.495 --> 01:09:57.236
This is Parson.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.760
Received a 911 call
from the Hiway Host Motel.

01:09:59.804 --> 01:10:02.502
Call did drop,
but the line is still live.

01:10:02.546 --> 01:10:05.157
10-4. On my way.

01:11:10.396 --> 01:11:12.137
Jesus Christ.

01:12:42.662 --> 01:12:44.795
Hello?

01:12:44.838 --> 01:12:46.971
Charlie?

01:12:47.014 --> 01:12:49.060
Hey, man, you better get back
to the pit stop.

01:12:49.103 --> 01:12:51.367
Sloan's ready to go.

01:14:50.398 --> 01:14:52.183
Good morning, sir.

01:14:52.226 --> 01:14:53.837
Morning, Carol.

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:57.101
Morning.
Benny called around 7:00.

01:14:57.754 --> 01:14:59.582
Any sign of the van?

01:14:59.625 --> 01:15:01.322
Lab said they wouldn't be able
to pull the prints

01:15:01.366 --> 01:15:03.368
for a couple weeks
off the Caddy.

01:15:03.411 --> 01:15:06.110
What about the boys
in Colton County?

01:15:07.241 --> 01:15:09.113
Nothing.

01:15:11.811 --> 01:15:13.596
Nothing.

01:15:14.292 --> 01:15:15.902
How's the nose?

01:15:15.946 --> 01:15:18.731
It's -- It's fine.

01:15:21.342 --> 01:15:23.301
How you doing?

01:15:25.782 --> 01:15:27.131
I'm doing.

01:15:32.223 --> 01:15:34.312
Coffee's been on
for about an hour.

01:15:48.108 --> 01:15:49.501
- Sheriff's department.
- Hey, Brad.

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:50.937
It's Jordan Murray.

01:15:50.981 --> 01:15:54.593
Listen, I just wanted to call
because...

01:15:54.637 --> 01:15:57.814
I think I know
where Nick Brenner is.

01:15:57.857 --> 01:16:00.425
He was working on my cabin.

01:16:02.906 --> 01:16:04.168
Frank, you got a call
on line one.

01:16:04.211 --> 01:16:06.039
I think you might
wanna pick this up.

01:16:08.999 --> 01:16:10.261
This is Frank.

01:16:10.304 --> 01:16:12.263
Frank, Jordan Murray here.

01:16:12.306 --> 01:16:13.743
I was just telling Brad

01:16:13.786 --> 01:16:16.746
that I think I might know
where Nick Brenner is.

01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:19.487
I'm on my way.

01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:41.602
Who was he?

01:19:48.305 --> 01:19:50.786
Just a man.

01:19:53.876 --> 01:19:57.314
Well, you gonna tell me
what happened here, Nick?

01:19:59.098 --> 01:20:02.014
I deserve that much at least.

01:20:38.224 --> 01:20:40.183
What are we looking for, man?

01:20:43.229 --> 01:20:45.057
I don't know.

01:20:51.585 --> 01:20:52.935
Yeah, I think they're long gone.

01:21:05.382 --> 01:21:07.166
Fuck, man.

01:21:12.606 --> 01:21:13.912
I mean, I --

01:21:13.956 --> 01:21:15.174
Oh!

01:21:16.045 --> 01:21:17.481
Oh, fuck! Aah!

01:21:17.524 --> 01:21:18.961
Sal?

01:21:19.004 --> 01:21:20.919
God!

01:21:31.625 --> 01:21:33.149
Forget about this.

01:21:33.192 --> 01:21:34.933
Hey!

01:21:34.977 --> 01:21:36.848
- What's going on?
- Get back!

01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:38.458
Aah!

01:21:38.502 --> 01:21:39.677
Fuck.

01:22:09.359 --> 01:22:11.883
Oh! Oh!

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:14.538
You!
Look what you did!

01:22:14.581 --> 01:22:17.367
- Look what you did!
- Look at me.

01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:28.987
You were supposed to die
in that house.

01:22:29.031 --> 01:22:30.684
I didn't.

01:22:30.728 --> 01:22:34.340
I can see that.

01:22:34.384 --> 01:22:36.560
Where is he?

01:22:36.603 --> 01:22:39.998
We could've been a family again.

01:22:40.042 --> 01:22:42.566
Like before.

01:22:47.571 --> 01:22:49.486
Okay.

01:22:51.749 --> 01:22:53.751
He's at the station.

01:22:53.794 --> 01:22:55.274
What station?

01:22:56.101 --> 01:22:58.016
Truck stop.

01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:00.279
It's just down the road.

01:23:05.545 --> 01:23:06.982
Come on, Nick!

01:23:21.648 --> 01:23:23.607
Sal?

01:23:23.650 --> 01:23:25.478
Hey.

01:23:27.089 --> 01:23:28.786
Hey, buddy.

01:23:28.829 --> 01:23:32.398
Hey. Sal.

01:23:32.442 --> 01:23:34.096
Look at me.
Come on, man.

01:23:34.139 --> 01:23:35.967
Come on.

01:23:36.924 --> 01:23:39.579
Oh, shit.

01:23:39.623 --> 01:23:41.668
Oh.

01:23:41.712 --> 01:23:43.888
Oh, fuck.

01:23:46.717 --> 01:23:47.674
Oh.

01:23:53.811 --> 01:23:55.900
I'm sorry.

01:25:16.546 --> 01:25:18.635
Hello?

01:25:18.678 --> 01:25:20.767
Charlie?

01:25:20.811 --> 01:25:22.856
Hey, man, you better get back
to the pit stop.

01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:24.336
Sloan's ready to go.

01:27:07.091 --> 01:27:08.745
Hey, Nick!

01:27:08.788 --> 01:27:10.486
Nick!

01:27:10.529 --> 01:27:13.576
Oh. Nick!

01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:16.361
Hey, man.

01:27:16.405 --> 01:27:19.059
Just talk to me
for a second, son.

01:27:20.931 --> 01:27:22.889
Don't disappoint me, boy.

01:27:23.803 --> 01:27:26.023
You got me.

01:27:26.066 --> 01:27:28.634
Talk to me.

01:27:28.678 --> 01:27:31.724
You owe me that.
Just talk to me.

01:28:05.018 --> 01:28:07.804
I told her when we got married

01:28:07.847 --> 01:28:10.720
that she would not have
to worry.

01:28:12.417 --> 01:28:15.028
Told her I'd be there for her.

01:28:17.466 --> 01:28:19.468
Promised.

01:28:25.996 --> 01:28:29.304
She was the only real thing
I had in this life.

01:29:10.997 --> 01:29:14.000
Still gonna have
to take you in, Nick.

01:29:18.309 --> 01:29:20.355
No.

01:29:23.575 --> 01:29:25.795
I ain't going to prison.

01:30:17.803 --> 01:30:20.980
I don't blame you
for what you done.

01:30:24.723 --> 01:30:26.682
I don't.

01:30:31.208 --> 01:30:35.081
But justice isn't yours
to serve.

01:30:36.605 --> 01:30:39.346
This ain't the wild, Nick.

01:30:42.175 --> 01:30:44.917
You should've
let the law handle it.

01:30:50.183 --> 01:30:53.012
The law wouldn't do what I did.

01:30:56.276 --> 01:30:59.454
Law's the only thing keeps us
from being savages.

01:31:07.374 --> 01:31:09.246
Like I said,
I can't go to prison,

01:31:09.289 --> 01:31:13.772
so you do whatever you gotta do.

01:31:57.729 --> 01:32:02.212
I tell people I served
this town for 30 years.

01:32:04.083 --> 01:32:06.912
That my blood is in this dirt.

01:32:10.176 --> 01:32:12.744
And in all that time,

01:32:12.788 --> 01:32:15.834
I only ever did one bad thing.

01:32:16.618 --> 01:32:19.359
If you wanna call it that.

01:32:23.755 --> 01:32:26.541
Maybe that's entitlement.

01:32:28.804 --> 01:32:30.893
Maybe not.

01:32:36.115 --> 01:32:38.640
Whatever it is, though...

01:32:39.902 --> 01:32:42.818
...it's a choice
I can live with.

01:32:56.135 --> 01:32:58.529
Imagine if they let Samson go

01:32:58.573 --> 01:33:01.706
instead of shackling him
to the temple.

01:33:03.969 --> 01:33:07.103
May have been a different
outcome altogether.

01:33:09.714 --> 01:33:12.238
Imagine that.
