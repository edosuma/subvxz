I last saw you at Stoneheart?

14:09.783 --> 14:12.420
- I was so upset that...

14:12.453 --> 14:15.723
I ran.

14:15.756 --> 14:17.925
I ran down
the stairs...

14:17.958 --> 14:20.428
into the street.
I saw all the dead people

14:20.461 --> 14:22.430
and all the
trashed buildings.

14:22.463 --> 14:25.399
I had no clue what to do.

14:25.433 --> 14:28.436
Then I ran into
that guy... Eichhorst.

14:28.469 --> 14:31.605
- What was Eichhorst doing?

14:31.639 --> 14:33.607
- He was looking for the Master.

14:33.641 --> 14:35.609
So he took me with him.

14:35.643 --> 14:39.347
- And you were with the Master
from then on?

14:39.380 --> 14:41.415
What was that like?

14:41.449 --> 14:43.417
- It was all right, I guess.

14:43.451 --> 14:45.753
He gave me lots
of cool stuff like...

14:45.786 --> 14:48.522
computers and video games.

14:48.556 --> 14:50.658
But he was always
working on me.

14:50.691 --> 14:53.427
Telling me how he was trying
to help the human race.

14:53.461 --> 14:55.629
- Did you believe him?

14:55.663 --> 14:57.531
- No.

14:57.565 --> 14:59.767
But I pretended to...

14:59.800 --> 15:01.602
'cause I was afraid
of what he might do.

15:01.635 --> 15:06.039
He had me do some
pretty messed up things.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.708
- Like what?

15:07.741 --> 15:10.544
- He took me
to the Central Park Zoo

15:10.578 --> 15:14.047
...and made me kill the tiger.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.617
- Why the hell would he do that?

15:16.650 --> 15:18.619
- He said something about

15:18.652 --> 15:20.888
feeling the power
of looking into the eyes

15:20.921 --> 15:23.357
of a creature
and taking its life.

15:24.558 --> 15:27.160
- And did you feel that power?

15:27.194 --> 15:30.163
- It made me feel
sick to my stomach.

15:30.197 --> 15:32.833
But of course,
I didn't tell him that.

15:40.107 --> 15:43.310
- Why do you think
he did all this?

15:43.343 --> 15:46.514
- 'Cause he wanted me
to turn against you.

15:46.547 --> 15:49.517
'Cause he knew I was upset
that you killed Mom.

15:49.550 --> 15:52.019
- That wasn't your mother.
That was a parasite.

15:52.052 --> 15:54.522
- I know, Dad.

15:54.555 --> 15:57.525
And I see that now, but...

15:57.558 --> 16:01.161
I didn't then.
I just missed her so much.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.664
And he said you hated Mom.

16:03.697 --> 16:05.999
And when she turned,

16:06.033 --> 16:09.002
it just gave you
the excuse you needed.

16:09.036 --> 16:12.540
- Is that what you think?

16:12.573 --> 16:14.542
- I did...

16:14.575 --> 16:17.344
for a long time, but...

16:17.377 --> 16:19.580
he was just trying
to get me to hate you.

16:19.613 --> 16:23.116
And I couldn't.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.787
'Cause I remember the look
on your face after you did it,

16:26.820 --> 16:30.558
and I realized...
that couldn't be the truth,

16:30.591 --> 16:33.226
no matter what the Master said.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.729
(sighing)

16:37.731 --> 16:40.701
- So, how'd you escape?

16:40.734 --> 16:42.736
- I didn't.

16:42.770 --> 16:46.039
The Master let me go.

16:46.073 --> 16:48.642
- Why would he do that?

16:48.676 --> 16:53.380
- Because he wanted me
to find you,

16:53.413 --> 16:55.983
and spy on you.

16:56.016 --> 17:00.588
Find out where
the nuclear bomb is,

17:00.621 --> 17:03.624
and go back and tell him.

17:18.338 --> 17:21.141
- Goodweather took these videos
in Pennsylvania.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.310
He's also seen

17:23.343 --> 17:25.245
the official Partnership
manifests ordering people

17:25.278 --> 17:28.448
to be transported to half
a dozen of these places.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.818
If the Master gets his way...

17:32.553 --> 17:35.489
...the entire human race will
end up in these feedlots.

17:37.190 --> 17:40.160
- Look, I know people
who've been to New Horizons

17:40.193 --> 17:42.162
and those places.
They're nothing like that.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.297
They're communal farms.

17:44.331 --> 17:46.266
Everybody is pitching in

17:46.299 --> 17:48.335
side by side in those fields.

17:48.368 --> 17:51.338
And, honestly,
it's working beautifully.

17:51.371 --> 17:54.474
- But you've never actually
been to these places.

17:54.508 --> 17:56.510
- Can you just
think for a second?

17:56.544 --> 17:58.512
Use your brain.

17:58.546 --> 18:00.981
Why would the strigoi

18:01.014 --> 18:03.483
put people into conditions
like that?

18:03.517 --> 18:05.786
Can you imagine the diseases
that would breed?

18:05.819 --> 18:07.788
It would contaminate
their blood supply.

18:07.821 --> 18:10.290
It's the last thing they want.
Bottom line:

18:10.323 --> 18:13.527
The healthier we are,
the healthier they are.

18:13.561 --> 18:16.697
- Then how do you explain this?
- It's fake.

18:16.730 --> 18:18.699
- You really think we have
the resources to build a camp

18:18.732 --> 18:20.968
and gather thousands
of people to stage this?

18:21.001 --> 18:24.337
- I think that if Dutch Velders
has the skill set

18:24.371 --> 18:27.174
to crash the Internet,
a few little pictures

18:27.207 --> 18:29.810
on a cell phone
are child's play for her.

18:29.843 --> 18:31.712
- Tell me something, then.

18:31.745 --> 18:34.314
Why the hell would we go
through all that trouble?

18:34.347 --> 18:35.482
- The same reason
you're blowing up a nuke

18:35.515 --> 18:37.084
in the middle of Manhattan.

18:37.117 --> 18:39.853
To sow chaos and panic
so that you can seize power.

18:39.887 --> 18:42.255
- This is getting us nowhere.

18:43.390 --> 18:46.226
- Have fun with this guy.

18:46.259 --> 18:48.395
- DESAI:
What?

18:50.564 --> 18:53.000
Oh, shit. No, no, no, no, no.
Look, you don't want to kill me.

18:53.033 --> 18:55.002
You don't want to kill me.
Dutch, you can't kill me.

18:55.035 --> 18:56.704
You'll have nothing
to bargain with.

18:56.737 --> 18:59.907
(gasping)
Oh. Thank you.

19:02.576 --> 19:04.544
Hey.

19:04.578 --> 19:07.715
Listen to me.
You don't want to do this.

19:07.748 --> 19:10.350
Let me talk to you. Please.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.419
I swear, you don't
want to kill me.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.421
Please.

19:14.454 --> 19:17.124
(groaning)

19:18.391 --> 19:20.594
(grunting)
- Sanjay.

19:20.628 --> 19:22.896
What's going on?
- Selah?

19:22.930 --> 19:24.598
How dare you?

19:25.999 --> 19:28.602
Selah has nothing
to do with this.

19:28.636 --> 19:30.437
- Your wife profited from the
people you tortured and killed.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.405
She's just as guilty as you are.

19:32.439 --> 19:35.308
- We're finished debating
the moral ramifications.

19:37.911 --> 19:40.080
This woman may be all you love

19:40.113 --> 19:42.215
in the world,

19:42.249 --> 19:44.417
but to me...

19:46.286 --> 19:48.255
...she's lunch.
- (gasping)

19:48.288 --> 19:50.924
- No, no, no, no.
- Tell us where the Master is...

19:50.958 --> 19:54.127
or I drink her. Here.

19:54.161 --> 19:56.096
- Sanjay.
- I can't.

19:56.129 --> 19:58.065
If we tell them,
the Master will come after us.

19:58.098 --> 19:59.599
I am so sorry
that this is happening,

19:59.633 --> 20:00.934
but you have to believe me,

20:00.968 --> 20:02.770
I did everything I could
to protect you.

20:02.803 --> 20:04.638
No, no, no. Please.

20:04.672 --> 20:06.139
Please. Stop this!

20:06.173 --> 20:07.775
- Oh, Sanjay, please.

20:07.808 --> 20:09.743
- Stop it! Okay! All right!

20:09.777 --> 20:13.446
The Master's nesting
in the Empire State Building.

20:15.482 --> 20:18.118
He's on the 102nd floor.

20:18.151 --> 20:20.253
- Now, that wasn't so hard,
was it?

20:20.287 --> 20:22.289
- Draw us the layout.

20:22.322 --> 20:24.291
Where everything
and everyone is.

20:24.324 --> 20:28.161
Leave nothing out.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.966
- So, what do they want?

20:33.000 --> 20:35.703
- They just want
to ask you some questions.

20:43.744 --> 20:44.912
- Hey, Fet.

20:46.179 --> 20:47.314
Dutch.

20:48.682 --> 20:50.017
- And this is...

20:50.050 --> 20:51.819
- The Born.

20:51.852 --> 20:54.855
- Shall we get on with it?

20:58.391 --> 21:00.961
- Zack...

21:00.994 --> 21:03.463
do you know
where the Master's nest is?

21:03.496 --> 21:06.166
- Yeah. I've been there.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.337
- Where is it?

21:10.370 --> 21:12.239
- It's at the top
of the Empire State Building.

21:16.443 --> 21:19.046
- Can you draw
what you saw there?

21:20.881 --> 21:23.550
- Sure.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.362
- I never thought silver
could be this heavy.

21:35.395 --> 21:38.398
- That's 'cause you never
ripped off anything bigger

21:38.431 --> 21:40.600
than your grandma's tea set.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.669
- You got that right.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.671
(both laugh)

21:44.704 --> 21:47.374
- What rock did Quinlan
find you under, huh?

21:47.407 --> 21:49.376
- Hold on.

21:49.409 --> 21:51.678
What is that supposed to mean?

21:51.711 --> 21:53.713
- I thought you were here
to help me guard the bomb.

21:53.747 --> 21:56.049
Now you're down here
and you're looting the vault?

21:56.083 --> 21:58.218
- Slow down, bro.

21:58.251 --> 22:01.388
You see any gold on this cart?

22:01.421 --> 22:03.356
Now, there was a time
I would've worried about lining

22:03.390 --> 22:04.792
my pockets,
but that kind of thinking

22:04.825 --> 22:06.860
brought me nothing but grief.

22:06.894 --> 22:09.897
- So, what's this about?

22:09.930 --> 22:11.899
- It's cool.

22:13.433 --> 22:14.634
Now, this plan
to nuke the Master,

22:14.667 --> 22:18.371
it might work, but it might not.

22:18.405 --> 22:21.141
I've been on this merry-go-round
a few times.

22:23.143 --> 22:25.112
This man I knew,

22:25.145 --> 22:27.114
he taught me...

22:27.147 --> 22:31.118
the most valuable thing
in this fight... is silver.

22:35.956 --> 22:37.791
You gonna help us or not?

22:42.095 --> 22:45.632
- ZACK: That's
all I can remember.

22:48.501 --> 22:50.904
- They're almost identical.

22:50.938 --> 22:53.440
- Zack and our prisoner were
kept separate. Neither knew

22:53.473 --> 22:56.977
the other one was here
or what we were talking about.

22:57.010 --> 23:00.280
- Yes, it appears
he's being truthful.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.617
But, then, a good spy would
tell the truth,

23:04.651 --> 23:08.255
or at least a portion of it,
to gain our trust.

23:08.288 --> 23:09.789
- ZACK: You don't
trust me? Fine.

23:09.823 --> 23:12.625
Lock me back in that cell
and leave me there.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.770
Can I... can I just go back now?

23:23.803 --> 23:25.805
- Sure.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.980
- What about 34th Street?

23:33.013 --> 23:35.648
- Same problem. If I were
the Master,

23:35.682 --> 23:38.118
I'd have strigoi on top
of every one of those buildings

23:38.151 --> 23:41.554
to spot us before
we got into reach.

23:48.061 --> 23:50.463
- How is he?

23:50.497 --> 23:52.465
- He's upset.

23:52.499 --> 23:55.335
Or doing a good job
pretending to be.

23:55.368 --> 23:57.037
- If ever there was a kid that
had a right to be messed up,

23:57.070 --> 24:01.308
it's Zack. Losing his mum,
his home, his friends.

24:01.341 --> 24:04.211
- So, you think he's
telling the truth?

24:06.046 --> 24:08.415
- I didn't say that, I'm just...

24:08.448 --> 24:10.650
saying he's traumatized.

24:10.683 --> 24:11.885
- So, you think he's lying.

24:11.919 --> 24:13.286
- No, I didn't say that, either.

24:15.422 --> 24:18.025
I want to believe him.

24:18.058 --> 24:21.528
There's just something
in my gut telling me not to.

24:21.561 --> 24:24.197
- What do you think?

24:24.231 --> 24:27.767
- Look, I want this
to work for you.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.270
And for Zack too; I really do.

24:30.303 --> 24:33.206
I was always fond of him, but...

24:33.240 --> 24:35.375
- But he knows that.

24:35.408 --> 24:39.579
And maybe he's
using it against us.

24:56.129 --> 24:58.598
- What about the anti-tank
rockets? You want them

24:58.631 --> 25:01.234
all in there, or should we put
some in with the nuke?

25:01.268 --> 25:03.903
- Let's start with the silver;
I'll let you know. Hey, Roman?

25:03.937 --> 25:06.406
- Uh-huh.

25:06.439 --> 25:08.575
- About these rockets.

25:08.608 --> 25:10.210
If one of them gets hit,

25:10.243 --> 25:12.645
is it gonna set off the bomb?
- No, no.

25:12.679 --> 25:14.647
These things are built
to blast into space,

25:14.681 --> 25:16.749
survive reentry,
and still go off

25:16.783 --> 25:18.651
right when they're told to.

25:18.685 --> 25:20.720
Miracles of engineering.

25:20.753 --> 25:23.890
- These miracles
of... engineering,

25:23.923 --> 25:26.926
they're responsible
for climate change, right?

25:26.960 --> 25:29.229
I mean, why the hell would you
mess with these things

25:29.262 --> 25:31.664
in the first place?
- I didn't join up to sling missles.

25:31.698 --> 25:34.601
I wanted to fly fighters.

25:34.634 --> 25:37.437
But I was an LT and, uh...

25:37.470 --> 25:39.639
there were four captains
in my class.

25:39.672 --> 25:42.275
- Well, life isn't fair, my man.

25:42.309 --> 25:44.111
- Tell you what, though.

25:44.144 --> 25:46.746
We kill this Master,

25:46.779 --> 25:49.049
vaporize his super worm,
or whatever...

25:50.850 --> 25:53.820
...that gold downstairs
would come in handy.

25:53.853 --> 25:55.822
- Holy shit.

25:55.855 --> 25:58.925
Captain Roman is
a thief at heart.

25:58.958 --> 26:01.328
- I'm not. Really.

26:01.361 --> 26:04.431
I just got to, uh... I got
to promise myself something good

26:04.464 --> 26:07.034
or I'll... I'll stop moving.

26:07.067 --> 26:09.769
Don't you need
something to dream about?

26:09.802 --> 26:12.339
You know, like going
someplace you've never been

26:12.372 --> 26:14.974
or... or looking up someone

26:15.008 --> 26:17.010
you want to see again?

26:17.044 --> 26:19.746
- Aanya.

26:26.553 --> 26:29.522
It's just this girl I met.
I helped her and her family

26:29.556 --> 26:32.325
get out of the city
before it went to hell.

26:32.359 --> 26:34.494
I just pray she didn't die...

26:34.527 --> 26:37.297
like everybody else I know.

26:37.330 --> 26:41.234
Or like I'm going to
by the end of this whole thing.

26:43.503 --> 26:45.472
- Well...

26:45.505 --> 26:47.474
I mean, if you don't make it,

26:47.507 --> 26:51.010
you want to give me her address
so I can console her?

26:51.044 --> 26:52.879
- Nice try, Romeo.

26:52.912 --> 26:55.715
But that's what I'm gonna do.

26:59.852 --> 27:01.754
(door creaking)

27:05.692 --> 27:07.860
- Thanks for getting me
out of there.

27:07.894 --> 27:09.729
- Well, we put you
through the wringer today.

27:09.762 --> 27:12.065
You deserve a break.

27:15.402 --> 27:17.104
Thirsty?

27:17.137 --> 27:18.838
(chuckles)

27:18.871 --> 27:23.210
- Can't remember the last time
I had a ginger ale.

27:26.045 --> 27:28.014
What are you looking at?

27:28.047 --> 27:29.882
- It's just so quiet.

27:29.916 --> 27:31.884
You remember
when all this started?

27:31.918 --> 27:33.953
Sirens every night,

27:33.986 --> 27:36.389
helicopters everywhere.

27:36.423 --> 27:38.558
- I wish we could
see some stars.

27:38.591 --> 27:40.560
- Me, too.

27:40.593 --> 27:43.763
It's been a long time
since I've seen stars.

27:43.796 --> 27:47.367
- Since I set off the nuke.

27:47.400 --> 27:50.203
Dad...

27:50.237 --> 27:53.240
I'm so sorry.

27:53.273 --> 27:55.242
I know I did a terrible thing,

27:55.275 --> 27:58.978
and I wish I could take it back.

28:03.816 --> 28:06.119
- You can't...

28:07.820 --> 28:10.490
...any more than I can
take back my mistakes.

28:14.161 --> 28:16.929
- Then what do we do?

28:16.963 --> 28:19.532
- We move on, somehow.

28:24.504 --> 28:26.105
You're getting big.

28:26.139 --> 28:29.142
You'll be taller than me soon.

28:29.176 --> 28:30.843
- I doubt it.

28:32.179 --> 28:35.114
Aah. Ah.

28:35.148 --> 28:36.949
- What happened?

28:36.983 --> 28:39.819
- Ah. Cut my thumb.
- Let me see?

28:41.654 --> 28:45.158
You know, we should probably
get this cleaned up. Come on.

28:46.193 --> 28:48.195
(door opens)

28:50.363 --> 28:52.365
(door closes)

28:57.837 --> 28:59.839
(dog barking in distance)

29:09.081 --> 29:10.717
(door closes)

29:18.157 --> 29:20.527
- You gonna get some
disinfectant?

29:20.560 --> 29:23.129
- Yeah, not yet.

29:23.162 --> 29:25.031
- Is something wrong?

29:26.566 --> 29:28.968
- How many cans of soda have you
opened in your life?

29:29.001 --> 29:31.671
- I don't know.

29:31.704 --> 29:34.641
- You ever cut your thumb
opening a can of soda?

29:34.674 --> 29:35.708
- No.

29:35.742 --> 29:37.043
- Why'd you do it tonight?

29:37.076 --> 29:39.212
- I was upset, I guess.

29:43.015 --> 29:45.151
- I think you did it on purpose.

29:45.184 --> 29:47.019
- Why would I do that?

29:47.053 --> 29:49.389
- To mark our location
with the scent of your blood.

29:49.422 --> 29:50.357
- That's crazy.

29:50.390 --> 29:51.691
- I don't think it is.

29:51.724 --> 29:53.226
I think you came here
to betray me.

29:53.260 --> 29:55.027
- Dad, I told you
everything I know.

29:55.061 --> 29:56.863
- As a matter of fact,
I think you've been lying to me

29:56.896 --> 29:58.865
from the second you got here.

29:58.898 --> 30:00.733
- I'm sorry
for what I did, okay?

30:00.767 --> 30:02.569
But I already told you that.

30:02.602 --> 30:04.871
- Will you just have
the decency to look at me

30:04.904 --> 30:07.540
and tell me the truth?

30:13.145 --> 30:16.383
- The truth is
my mother is not a parasite.

30:16.416 --> 30:19.252
- What-what do you mean,
your mother is not a parasite?

30:19.286 --> 30:21.754
- You didn't kill her.
She's still alive.

30:21.788 --> 30:23.523
- What are you talking about?

30:23.556 --> 30:26.025
- Mom's alive,
inside the Master.

30:26.058 --> 30:28.094
And he lets
her come out and talk to me.

30:28.127 --> 30:30.597
She remembers everything.

30:30.630 --> 30:32.532
You're the liar, not me.

30:32.565 --> 30:34.601
She told me all
about you and Nora.

30:34.634 --> 30:36.536
How you had sex with her.

30:36.569 --> 30:38.371
That's why Mom kicked you out.

30:38.405 --> 30:40.440
That's the truth.

30:40.473 --> 30:42.442
Guess what, Dad, you were right.

30:42.475 --> 30:45.545
The feelers can track
the scent of blood for miles.

30:45.578 --> 30:46.779
- Jesus.

30:49.482 --> 30:51.618
- Now listen carefully, Dad,

30:51.651 --> 30:54.086
'cause we don't have much time.

30:54.120 --> 30:57.624
The Master said I get to decide
what to do with you.

30:57.657 --> 31:00.092
So tell me where the nuke is,

31:00.126 --> 31:02.462
and I'll let you live.

31:18.378 --> 31:20.813
(whimpering)

31:29.322 --> 31:31.491
Where is it?

31:31.524 --> 31:34.961
- Goodbye, Zack.

31:34.994 --> 31:37.263
- Where are you going?

31:37.296 --> 31:40.132
- You made your choice.
Live with it.

31:40.166 --> 31:42.435
- Dad! Dad!
Listen to me!

31:42.469 --> 31:45.037
I'm trying to save your life.

31:45.071 --> 31:46.272
(banging)

31:46.305 --> 31:49.008
Dad, wait. Dad!

31:49.041 --> 31:52.111
- We could surface right here,
around 42nd Street.

31:52.144 --> 31:53.480
- Then we'd have
to steal a vehicle

31:53.513 --> 31:55.314
and transfer our payload.

31:55.348 --> 31:57.484
- We have to go right now.

31:57.517 --> 31:59.619
You were right.

31:59.652 --> 32:02.489
Zack's working with the Master.

32:02.522 --> 32:05.157
I took him up to the roof.
He cut his thumb open.

32:05.191 --> 32:06.526
- It's like setting off a flare.

32:06.559 --> 32:07.860
- Oh, goddamn it.

32:07.894 --> 32:09.862
- I'm so sorry, Eph.

32:09.896 --> 32:11.498
- Me, too. But right now,

32:11.531 --> 32:13.199
the Master's sending his troops.
We have to go.

32:13.232 --> 32:14.401
- Where?

32:14.434 --> 32:16.035
- The Federal Reserve.

32:16.068 --> 32:18.871
We'll come up with the rest
of the plan there.

32:23.576 --> 32:24.977
- What's our target?

32:25.011 --> 32:26.379
- Empire State Building.

32:26.413 --> 32:28.014
Zack and Desai,

32:28.047 --> 32:30.182
they both confirmed that
the Master was nesting there.

32:30.216 --> 32:31.984
- Zack is a tool of the Master.

32:32.018 --> 32:33.486
If he told us about
the Empire State Building,

32:33.520 --> 32:35.054
it's because
the Master wanted him to.

32:35.087 --> 32:37.056
- Means he's moved somewhere
and probably

32:37.089 --> 32:38.425
set a trap for us there.

32:38.458 --> 32:40.026
- It's possible.

32:40.059 --> 32:42.562
But if it is a trap,
we can turn it to our advantage.

32:42.595 --> 32:45.498
- Yeah. Like a rat springs
a trap to get the cheese.

32:45.532 --> 32:48.234
- This is an opportunity
we can't afford to ignore.

32:48.267 --> 32:50.437
- Obviously the Master wants to
lure the nuke out into the open

32:50.470 --> 32:52.539
where he can get at it.

32:52.572 --> 32:55.207
- Is there a way to trigger
this bomb remotely?

32:55.241 --> 32:57.043
- Yeah, I, uh...

32:57.076 --> 32:59.211
I rigged this up.

32:59.245 --> 33:02.381
Problem is you can only trigger
from about a thousand yards,

33:02.415 --> 33:05.084
which means you're still
gonna be in the blast zone.

33:05.117 --> 33:07.086
- It's not a factor.

33:07.119 --> 33:09.121
I don't plan to survive.

33:11.791 --> 33:13.292
- Hardcore.

33:14.761 --> 33:17.296
- If the Master wants
to draw us into a trap,

33:17.329 --> 33:20.232
then into his trap I shall go.

33:20.266 --> 33:22.602
If I can lure him to me,

33:22.635 --> 33:24.771
I'll contact you via radio.
You'll then drive the bomb

33:24.804 --> 33:26.773
to the base of the building
and escape

33:26.806 --> 33:28.875
before I trigger the weapon.

33:28.908 --> 33:32.411
- Hey, that's a hell of
a Hail Mary play there, Born-o.

33:32.445 --> 33:35.281
- You have a better idea?

33:35.314 --> 33:37.216
- How... how big a boom
are we looking for?

33:37.249 --> 33:40.252
- We just want to take out
the Empire State Building.

33:42.489 --> 33:43.656
(clears throat)

33:43.690 --> 33:45.558
I'll set it to 15 kilotons.

33:45.592 --> 33:48.294
The fireball will
vaporize the building

33:48.327 --> 33:51.598
and leave nothing but a crater
a hundred feet deep.

33:51.631 --> 33:54.133
- Jesus Christ.

33:58.137 --> 34:01.240
- Are you sure
you're okay with this?

34:01.273 --> 34:03.075
- No.

34:03.109 --> 34:06.012
But it's the least-bad
option we have.

34:20.860 --> 34:22.495
- We should have seen
some strigs by now.

34:22.529 --> 34:24.531
Where the hell are they?

34:24.564 --> 34:26.666
- Something's not right.

34:32.471 --> 34:34.473
- You know, I'd feel a damn
sight better if you stop

34:34.507 --> 34:36.676
monkeying around
with that trigger.

34:36.709 --> 34:39.612
- I've been handling
weapons safely for...

34:39.646 --> 34:41.914
- 2,000 years, right.

34:44.016 --> 34:48.688
But it takes one screw-up
to ruin a good streak, Born-o.

35:13.212 --> 35:15.181
- Stay here.

35:15.214 --> 35:17.584
Wait for my call.

35:20.019 --> 35:22.054
- Well, Born-o...

35:26.392 --> 35:28.394
Good hunting.

35:37.103 --> 35:39.105
- Good luck.

35:40.973 --> 35:42.775
All of you.

35:48.080 --> 35:50.216
- That one has
quite a pair of balls.

35:50.249 --> 35:52.785
- Actually, he doesn't.

35:52.819 --> 35:54.587
(chuckles softly)

35:55.722 --> 35:57.724
- Hear anything?

35:57.757 --> 35:59.525
- No.

35:59.558 --> 36:00.793
- They must have
left someone to guard us.

36:00.827 --> 36:02.428
- Not if they're going
for the Master.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.764
They're gonna need
every last person they got.

36:04.797 --> 36:06.365
- What if they all get killed?

36:06.398 --> 36:08.567
No one knows
we're locked in here.

36:08.601 --> 36:10.036
We could starve to death.

36:10.069 --> 36:11.437
- Selah, it's okay.

36:11.470 --> 36:12.605
(crying)

36:12.639 --> 36:14.306
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

36:16.609 --> 36:18.577
I'm sorry this happened.

36:18.611 --> 36:22.214
I'm sorry I couldn't
protect you from this.

36:22.248 --> 36:25.051
But you have to believe I tried.

36:25.084 --> 36:27.053
Everything I did, I did for you.
- Shit.

36:27.086 --> 36:28.888
- What?
- You didn't do

36:28.921 --> 36:31.724
a goddamn thing for me.
You did it for you.

36:31.758 --> 36:33.893
- I... no. You're saying I...
I liked working for Eichhorst,

36:33.926 --> 36:36.128
dealing with all that...
that pressure and that shit?

36:36.162 --> 36:37.897
- Yes, I do.

36:37.930 --> 36:41.000
(laughing):
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

36:41.033 --> 36:43.269
I'm very sorry
that you feel that way.

36:43.302 --> 36:45.271
But you're wrong.

36:45.304 --> 36:47.239
I did do it for you.

36:47.273 --> 36:49.508
- And what about
banging your assistants?

36:49.541 --> 36:52.111
Did you do that for me, too?

36:52.144 --> 36:53.780
- Excuse me?

36:53.813 --> 36:55.314
- You really think
I'm that stupid?

36:55.347 --> 36:58.184
- You have always been
the one for me, always.

36:58.217 --> 36:59.819
I have never
been unfaithful to you.

36:59.852 --> 37:02.421
(muffled crashing)

37:02.454 --> 37:04.991
- What was that?

37:07.393 --> 37:09.962
(clattering)

37:09.996 --> 37:11.197
(door opens)

37:14.701 --> 37:16.669
- Where is the weapon?

37:16.703 --> 37:20.139
- They wouldn't tell me.

37:20.172 --> 37:23.810
- You were not supposed
to signal me until you found it.

37:23.843 --> 37:27.179
- I know, but... they saw
through me, so I thought...

37:27.213 --> 37:29.648
- Where are they now?

37:29.682 --> 37:30.817
- What do we do now? Hmm?
- Shh.

37:30.850 --> 37:32.118
- Sanjay.
- Just shut up.

37:32.151 --> 37:33.786
I'm trying to figure this out.

37:33.820 --> 37:35.487
(door opens)

37:36.689 --> 37:37.990
Master.

37:38.024 --> 37:39.959
Thank God.

37:39.992 --> 37:42.461
- You're injured?

37:42.494 --> 37:45.798
- Oh, uh. Dutch. Dutch Velders,
she did this to me.

37:45.832 --> 37:46.866
- They interrogated you?

37:46.899 --> 37:48.801
- No. Y-Yes. They tried.

37:48.835 --> 37:50.837
- What's she doing here?

37:50.870 --> 37:52.004
- They tried to use her

37:52.038 --> 37:54.173
as leverage. But it didn't work.

37:54.206 --> 37:55.474
We... we didn't say anything.

37:55.507 --> 37:57.009
- ZACK:
He's lying.

37:57.043 --> 37:59.178
He told them you were
at the Empire State Building.

37:59.211 --> 38:00.980
I heard the others
talking about it.

38:01.013 --> 38:03.682
(snarling)

38:03.716 --> 38:06.719
- She... she told them.

38:06.753 --> 38:08.721
- Sanjay.
- I tried to stop her.

38:08.755 --> 38:11.190
- You know I didn't.
- Selah, I'm so sorry.

38:11.223 --> 38:13.592
I begged you to stay quiet.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.361
I wish you had listened.

38:15.394 --> 38:17.696
- You son of a bitch. I...

38:17.730 --> 38:20.366
(bones snapping)

38:25.537 --> 38:27.740
- I tried to control her, sir.

38:31.577 --> 38:35.214
She was always so impetuous.

38:35.247 --> 38:39.451
- It wasn't your wife.
It was you.

38:39.485 --> 38:41.720
- But it was only because...

38:41.754 --> 38:43.689
Sir, please.

38:43.722 --> 38:45.224
Please don't. You need me.

38:45.257 --> 38:47.493
(crunches, Desai grunts)

38:51.931 --> 38:53.766
(body drops)

38:56.268 --> 39:00.239
- Such a creature
is beneath contempt.

39:00.272 --> 39:03.109
Perhaps it is clear to you now

39:03.142 --> 39:08.114
that I have no tolerance
for the weak.

39:13.986 --> 39:16.422
(snarling)

39:56.829 --> 39:58.797
(beep)

39:58.831 --> 40:00.199
(beeping)

40:00.232 --> 40:01.834
- We've gone hot.

40:06.205 --> 40:09.008
- What's going on, Born-o?

40:09.041 --> 40:11.010
- I'm just entering
the lobby now.

40:11.043 --> 40:14.046
Looks like nobody's home.

40:14.080 --> 40:16.115
I'm going up.

40:16.148 --> 40:18.284
- Could be a boatload
of munchers between you

40:18.317 --> 40:20.152
and the top floor.

40:20.186 --> 40:23.822
- Then it might take me a while.

40:33.665 --> 40:35.667
(elevator chimes)

40:59.525 --> 41:01.393
- He's not here.

41:01.427 --> 41:02.995
- Where is he?

41:03.029 --> 41:04.696
- You think I'm gonna tell you?

41:04.730 --> 41:05.831
- Quinlan.

41:05.864 --> 41:08.867
Do you hear me?

41:08.901 --> 41:10.702
What's going on?

41:10.736 --> 41:12.604
(labored breathing)

41:21.647 --> 41:24.083
- Tell them, Invictus.

41:25.651 --> 41:27.920
Tell them how you have failed...

41:27.954 --> 41:29.922
yet again.

41:29.956 --> 41:32.891
- He's not here.

41:32.925 --> 41:34.393
- Not here?

41:34.426 --> 41:36.395
Not here as in
not on the top floor?

41:36.428 --> 41:38.397
Or not here as in
not in the building?

41:38.430 --> 41:39.831
- Not in the building.

41:42.334 --> 41:44.270
- So, what do you want us to do?

41:47.406 --> 41:49.375
- Such a pity

41:49.408 --> 41:52.211
you've wasted your existence

41:52.244 --> 41:54.313
with humans

41:54.346 --> 41:57.950
instead of taking
your place beside me.

41:57.984 --> 41:59.918
- And become a pawn
like the boy?

41:59.952 --> 42:03.555
- He's more of a son to me
athan you have ever been.

42:03.589 --> 42:06.725
(growling)

42:06.758 --> 42:10.997
(snarling)

42:14.300 --> 42:16.268
(scoffs)

42:16.302 --> 42:18.270
- Pathetic.

42:19.505 --> 42:22.474
Is this the best you can do?

42:22.508 --> 42:24.943
Dispatching these vermin

42:24.977 --> 42:27.779
instead of having the courage
to face me yourself?

42:27.813 --> 42:29.481
- You think I'm foolish enough

42:29.515 --> 42:32.318
to come within range
of your bomb?

42:32.351 --> 42:35.287
- Understand this:

42:35.321 --> 42:37.423
until you confront me,

42:37.456 --> 42:39.658
you will never have
the security you crave.

42:39.691 --> 42:41.660
No matter how many humans
you enslave,

42:41.693 --> 42:44.496
no matter how many cities
you hollow out,

42:44.530 --> 42:47.466
I shall never give up
my pursuit of you.

42:47.499 --> 42:49.501
(growling)

42:51.537 --> 42:54.540
- You'll have
your confrontation.

42:54.573 --> 42:58.877
But not here, not now.

42:58.910 --> 43:03.182
It'll be at a time and place
of my choosing.

43:03.215 --> 43:05.184
Not yours.

43:05.217 --> 43:07.386
- Quinlan.
- (demonic laughter)

43:12.524 --> 43:14.526
- He didn't take the bait.
Leave at once.

43:14.560 --> 43:16.195
Get the bomb to safety.

43:16.228 --> 43:18.497
- What about you?

43:18.530 --> 43:20.732
(snarling)

43:25.704 --> 43:27.839
Born-o!

43:27.873 --> 43:30.509
(snarling)

43:30.542 --> 43:33.212
- We got trouble.

43:33.245 --> 43:34.880
(snarling)

43:34.913 --> 43:36.315
- Shit.

43:36.348 --> 43:38.417
- Brace for impact.

43:58.970 --> 44:00.539
