02:23.977 --> 02:26.696
Obi, we anchor here.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.203
We stay here tonight, Nardo.

02:44.247 --> 02:47.568
We go to the Black Lagoon in the morning.
I'll fix you some supper now.

02:47.668 --> 02:53.016
- What are we having tonight?
- Big surprise. What we didn't finish last night.

02:55.801 --> 02:58.829
What I'd give for a tall, cold beer.

02:58.929 --> 03:00.956
Or a short, warm blonde.

03:01.056 --> 03:03.417
The Gill Man, prehistoric monster.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.295
- Maybe there's no such thing.
- You find him, mister. I'll catch him.

03:06.395 --> 03:09.673
It doesn't look good for a conservative
institution like Ocean Harbor...

03:09.773 --> 03:11.800
to circus a yarn
and then not to deliver.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.844
If you're smart,
you won't worry about it.

03:13.944 --> 03:16.221
If there is a Gill Man, we'll catch him.

03:16.321 --> 03:20.792
If it's a phony,
well, the boss is out his dough.

03:22.244 --> 03:23.996
George.

03:25.414 --> 03:27.633
- Hey, Lucas.
- Yes, Mr. Johnson?

03:29.501 --> 03:31.528
Ah, it's a crocodile.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.655
Huh, you think maybe that is it?

03:33.755 --> 03:37.576
Oh no, the thing you are looking
for can break that in two.

03:37.676 --> 03:41.163
You know, sometimes I think
all North Americanos are crazy.

03:41.263 --> 03:43.373
If he is dead, you waste your money.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.043
If he's alive,
maybe you be sorry you find him.

03:46.143 --> 03:48.754
Yeah? There isn't a fish alive
I can't handle.

03:48.854 --> 03:51.232
Who says he's a fish?

03:52.941 --> 03:54.943
What a character.

04:00.699 --> 04:04.102
This sweatbox.
Doesn't it ever cool off here?

04:04.202 --> 04:07.773
Never. You want to go back?
At your service.

04:07.873 --> 04:10.734
Not till we get the...
the whatever it is.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.611
Then we'll go back.

04:12.711 --> 04:15.656
He won't rest easy till he's got it
in the tank back at Ocean Harbor.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.283
What for do you want to do this?

04:18.382 --> 04:21.870
So people can come
and stare at the man-fish?

04:21.970 --> 04:24.539
To please some crazy scientists?

04:24.639 --> 04:26.833
For this you're going
to risk your lives?

04:26.933 --> 04:28.919
Who said anything about risking lives?

04:29.019 --> 04:33.256
- It's a job. A technical job.
- Maybe then you got a book...

04:33.356 --> 04:36.760
that going to tell you
how to do this thing?

04:36.860 --> 04:40.180
- Now look, we're not paying you to make jokes.
- No joke.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.724
Tomorrow we gonna be in the lagoon.

04:42.824 --> 04:45.310
You will go down in the water.

04:45.410 --> 04:51.088
Then is no longer time for talking,
so maybe is better we talk now, huh?

04:54.252 --> 04:56.613
Okay, go ahead.

04:56.713 --> 05:00.784
Last year I came to this place
with a party of scientists.

05:00.884 --> 05:05.372
Also brave and highly technical people.

05:05.472 --> 05:10.085
In the end, five persons were dead.

05:10.185 --> 05:13.064
The Gill Man, still there.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.633
- Were they equipped for the capture?
- No.

05:16.733 --> 05:17.950
Well, we are.

05:18.777 --> 05:22.764
So, I like to ask you something.

05:22.864 --> 05:25.934
I'm not very educated person.

05:26.034 --> 05:31.106
This Gill Man, this thing
I have seen with my eyes...

05:31.206 --> 05:34.506
it... it doesn't belong in our world.

05:36.044 --> 05:38.655
It should've died out
long before man was born.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.700
Still, it exists. Why?

05:41.800 --> 05:44.953
Well, I'll try to explain it to you.

05:45.053 --> 05:49.624
Sometimes a species
gets isolated in time.

05:49.724 --> 05:53.837
If the conditions are right,
it reproduces itself without change...

05:53.937 --> 05:57.758
skipping a chapter of evolution.

05:57.858 --> 06:01.511
Way back, there must have been
some major link...

06:01.611 --> 06:04.723
between marine and terrestrial life.

06:04.823 --> 06:07.622
It's just possible that this is it.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.996
Well, that's all there is to it.

06:12.581 --> 06:15.734
Now I tell you what I believe.

06:15.834 --> 06:19.279
This beast exists
because it is stronger than...

06:19.379 --> 06:22.616
than the thing that you call evolution.

06:22.716 --> 06:26.119
In it is some force of life. A demon...

06:26.219 --> 06:29.039
driving it through millions
of centuries.

06:29.139 --> 06:33.986
It does not surrender so easily
to weaklings like you and me.

06:35.103 --> 06:38.073
This is the thing that you hunt for.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.158
Think on it.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.534
Good night, gentlemen.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.439
Well...

06:54.539 --> 06:58.735
And that, kiddies,
is our fairy story for tonight.

06:58.835 --> 07:01.258
Joe, maybe he's right.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.558
Back in Florida...

07:05.175 --> 07:10.080
You don't suppose that they expect us
to lose our lives over this thing?

07:10.180 --> 07:13.291
Maybe we got no business
to be here at all.

07:13.391 --> 07:15.168
Want to play some cards?

07:15.268 --> 07:19.047
No. No, I think I'll try
to get some sleep.

07:19.147 --> 07:22.425
- You better do the same.
- Oh, I'll sleep fine.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.573
No imagination.

08:15.537 --> 08:18.773
- Drop anchor.
- Yes, Captain.

08:18.873 --> 08:21.592
Nardo, bring the net.

08:51.740 --> 08:54.434
Bring the net down. Lower.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.834
Good. The Americano does the rest.

08:58.830 --> 09:01.566
You get that net secure, Joe,
and we got the entrance sealed off.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.509
Well, let's go.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.579
In a suit like that,
you'll be helpless as a baby.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.289
This baby was born in that suit.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.583
He's taken pretty good care
of himself up to now.

09:18.683 --> 09:21.653
Now is different, my friend.

09:53.051 --> 09:57.648
- How are things?
- <i>Lucas isn't getting a skirt, is he?</i>

10:21.329 --> 10:22.981
<i>Take me up, George! Take me up!</i>

10:23.081 --> 10:27.336
Bring him in! Bring him in! He's in trouble.
The lines are fouled up.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.729
Joe! Joe, are you all right? Joe!

10:50.191 --> 10:53.161
- Is he gone?
- Joe, can you hear me?

10:59.450 --> 11:01.478
Hey, look! He's coming up!

11:01.578 --> 11:03.813
Keep bringing him in. Bring him in!

11:03.913 --> 11:05.506
Hurry up!

11:17.760 --> 11:21.081
- He's got the air hose.
- Get the rifle.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.479
Quick, shoot him! Shoot him!

11:30.023 --> 11:32.242
Good! Bring him to the ladder.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.724
- Help him up.
- Get him on deck.

11:39.824 --> 11:42.102
Oh, he's hurt.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.562
Look at that suit. It's all slashed.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.790
Watch his feet, Obi.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.192
- Water in the suit.
- Get him over there and sit him down.

11:49.292 --> 11:52.529
- Quick as you can.
- Look, he's bleeding badly.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.973
I'll get this helmet-plate off.

11:58.343 --> 12:01.538
- Did you get him?
- I don't know, but I'm glad he didn't get you.

12:01.638 --> 12:05.188
- Pull the pin, Lucas.
- Sí, I do it. Sí.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.973
I hope you ain't going
to blow up my boat, Mr. Johnson.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.642
Like my wife, she's not much,
but she's all I have.

12:22.742 --> 12:23.726
Don't worry.

12:23.826 --> 12:27.397
There's just enough dynamite in these cans
to stun anything below the surface.

12:27.497 --> 12:30.024
If that thing's alive,
this oughta do the trick.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.967
- Go on back to the Rita.
- All right.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.514
Uh, you do it easy, huh?

12:41.594 --> 12:44.268
- You ready?
- Here goes nothin'.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.283
Well, no sign of him.

13:20.383 --> 13:24.138
Maybe this time we are lucky
and he is dead, huh?

13:29.892 --> 13:34.172
- There he is!
- What's this? Where?

13:34.272 --> 13:35.694
There.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.177
By golly, you're right. There he is.

13:39.277 --> 13:43.723
- Come on, Lucas, let's go get him.
- Always I have the bad luck.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.326
Be sure you tie him up good.

13:48.286 --> 13:52.941
This is the first telephoto of the fantastic
find received from Rio de Janeiro.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.651
The creature is in a coma.

13:54.751 --> 13:58.446
Has been ever since its capture
in an isolated Amazon lagoon.

13:58.546 --> 14:02.200
Right now it's being flown to Florida's
famed Ocean Harbor Oceanarium...

14:02.300 --> 14:05.620
where the experts hope
to restore it to consciousness.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.998
Movement of the creature
has required some split second timing.

14:09.098 --> 14:12.418
It can exist out of water
for only a few minutes at a stretch.

14:12.518 --> 14:15.713
The capture of the Gill Man has created
the greatestscientific stir...

14:15.813 --> 14:18.299
since the explosion of the atomic bomb.

14:18.399 --> 14:20.343
Further information
is anxiously awaited...

14:20.443 --> 14:23.913
in colleges and universities
throughout the world.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.438
Why, Neal, that's wonderful.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.775
You have such a vibrant color sense
for a four-year-old.

14:35.875 --> 14:40.426
You know, I think this one is even
good enough to show to your friends.

14:41.172 --> 14:43.741
All right, lesson's over.

14:43.841 --> 14:46.244
Now, turn around, Neal. Turn around.

14:46.344 --> 14:49.974
Turn around. Sit down. All right now.

14:50.681 --> 14:52.809
Open your mouth.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.938
Oh, that's a boy.

14:57.855 --> 15:00.404
All right now. Cover your eyes.
Cover your eyes.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.721
That's a good boy.
Now stand up. Stand up.

15:04.821 --> 15:08.057
Now put your arms over your head
and stretch. Oh, what a good boy.

15:08.157 --> 15:10.351
- Good morning, Miss Abbott.
- Good morning, Dr. Ferguson.

15:10.451 --> 15:13.438
Good morning, Neal.
Come over here and see me.

15:13.538 --> 15:15.023
- How's he doing?
- Fine.

15:15.123 --> 15:17.876
Neal, what do you think of your work?

15:19.836 --> 15:23.781
- Flattery will get you nowhere.
- It's just amazing.

15:23.881 --> 15:25.616
He's really as bright as a child.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.952
Well, as bright as a two
or three-year-old anyway.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.163
Well, that's fine, but remember...

15:30.263 --> 15:32.165
we're supposed to find out
what the difference is...

15:32.265 --> 15:34.917
between the intelligence of an ape
and a human being.

15:35.017 --> 15:38.171
And at the rate he's going, sometimes
I wonder if there is any difference.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.381
- Doc, would you come here a minute?
- Sure.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.700
Alright. Come on, boy.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.636
Doc, didn't you say
that among the lower animals...

15:45.736 --> 15:48.514
there were no natural enemies
as long as they're well fed?

15:48.614 --> 15:51.267
- Yeah, something like that.
- Well, maybe so, Doc...

15:51.367 --> 15:53.728
but there were four rats in there
when I changed my lights.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.688
Now there's only three.

15:55.788 --> 15:59.442
It's my considered opinion that rat
number four is sitting inside that cat.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.778
Are you sure you fed them all
this morning?

16:01.878 --> 16:05.257
Sure, I always feed them. I...

16:09.969 --> 16:12.142
How'd he get in here?

16:13.890 --> 16:16.292
Clete. Clete,
here's the most important news that...

16:16.392 --> 16:18.711
The greatest scientific find
since the Peking man.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.297
What you got, Mac,
someone unearth a natural blonde?

16:21.397 --> 16:25.843
Here. They've captured that Devonian relic
Dr. Reed reported last year.

16:25.943 --> 16:29.180
- You're kidding.
- Know what I think?

16:29.280 --> 16:31.724
I think you should be thinking
about going down to Ocean Harbor.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.394
You wouldn't have any trouble.
They know your work down there.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.437
Clete. Clete, you can be
the first man...

16:36.537 --> 16:39.232
to scientifically study a creature that,
by all the laws of nature...

16:39.332 --> 16:42.302
should've died a quarter
of a million years ago.

16:44.629 --> 16:46.280
Where are you going?

16:46.380 --> 16:49.884
To ask the dean for a leave
of absence. What else?

16:56.682 --> 16:59.043
- Joe, Johnson.
- Hello!

16:59.143 --> 17:02.755
- How are you, Lou, Mr. Foster?
- Never better, Joe.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.550
The whole country is talking
about that catch of yours.

17:05.650 --> 17:08.051
That right?
Well, it oughta be worth a raise then.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.512
It is.

17:09.612 --> 17:11.513
What's this I hear
about you gettin' mauled?

17:11.614 --> 17:15.335
Ah, just a few scratches.
Hey, we'll bring him right up.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.229
Well, let's go down there, boys.

17:18.329 --> 17:20.731
Now keep him straight.
Guide him in there easily.

17:20.830 --> 17:23.483
Watch his head
that it doesn't hit on that bulkhead.

17:23.584 --> 17:27.054
All right. Move him through slowly.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.676
Lower it just a little.

17:32.343 --> 17:35.096
All right. All right, take it away.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.770
Watch this railing here.
Watch this railing.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.052
Hold steady there.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.654
That's it.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.877
Okay, swing it in.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.522
Keep it comin', boys.

18:01.622 --> 18:04.066
Keep him comin'. Right in here.

18:04.166 --> 18:08.262
All set, George. Keep it comin'.
Raise it up a little.

18:10.715 --> 18:12.638
Up a little higher.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.012
All right, hold it. Now down.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.795
All right, hold it. Hold it.

18:24.895 --> 18:26.568
That's good.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.762
Afraid I've got some bad news
for you, Mr. Foster.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.305
- The Gill Man?
- Yeah.

18:34.405 --> 18:36.474
Been in a coma
ever since we captured him.

18:36.574 --> 18:39.852
- But he's still alive.
- Yeah, just about.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.896
Look, Joe, you can't do this to me.

18:41.996 --> 18:45.900
I've got every man, woman and child in the
civilized world waiting to meet the Gill Man.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.528
The hotels are booked
for 50 miles around here.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.238
I've got the radio, the TV...

18:50.338 --> 18:52.490
Louie, speeches aren't gonna do
any good now.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.742
We'll put him in the receiving tank
and we'll see what happens.

18:54.842 --> 18:58.016
- Come on, let's get rolling, Mac.
- Okay, Joe.

19:10.566 --> 19:11.509
Hold him level now.

19:11.609 --> 19:13.553
<i>I suppose we might describe this,
ladies and gentlemen...</i>

19:13.653 --> 19:16.847
<i>as the creature's official entry
into the 20th century.</i>

19:16.947 --> 19:19.767
<i>Here at Ocean Harbor
it will live, if it lives at all...</i>

19:19.867 --> 19:22.270
<i>and become the object
of scientific study.</i>

19:22.370 --> 19:25.856
<i>The question now is whether Joe Hayes,
the man who captured the creature...</i>

19:25.956 --> 19:28.693
<i>will be able to bring it out
of its comatose condition.</i>

19:28.793 --> 19:31.195
<i>He's waiting for it now.
Alone in the tank.</i>

19:31.295 --> 19:35.366
<i>Apparently showing no sign of fear
as his arms reach out.</i>

19:35.466 --> 19:37.410
Easy now. Let it down easy.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.663
I've got it.
All right, down just a little.

19:40.763 --> 19:42.373
All right, hold it.

19:42.473 --> 19:45.943
- Can you get him out, Joe?
- Yeah, I can make it.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.090
Okay, take it away.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.158
Take up the rig.

19:56.779 --> 19:58.514
Hey, boys, look up here.

19:58.614 --> 20:01.618
Man, look at that thing.

20:03.244 --> 20:06.498
- Will he come out of it?
- Too early to tell.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.449
Pardon me, sir.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.534
Miss Dobson, may I have a word with you?

20:18.634 --> 20:21.245
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have here Miss Helen Dobson.

20:21.345 --> 20:24.040
One of the prettiest young ladies
it's ever been my pleasure to interview.

20:24.140 --> 20:27.835
Miss Dobson was a science major
at Belmont University in Texas and now...

20:27.935 --> 20:29.962
Well, perhaps I'd better get her
to explain it to you.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.797
What brings you
to the oceanarium, Miss Dobson?

20:31.897 --> 20:34.592
I'm here to gather material
for my masters thesis.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.886
- I'm studying ichthyology.
- Ichthyology?

20:36.986 --> 20:39.889
That's a ten-dollar word.
How about explaining it to us?

20:39.989 --> 20:43.934
- Well, ichthyology is the study of fish.
- I see.

20:44.034 --> 20:48.564
I noticed that Joe Hayes out here
has the Gill Man down in the water...

20:48.664 --> 20:51.150
and he's walking him around.
That seems to be a strange thing to do.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.027
Is there any particular reason for it?

20:53.127 --> 20:56.072
Well, that's the way they revive sharks
and other large fish.

20:56.172 --> 20:59.517
And since this creature has gills,
they're using the same method.

21:00.509 --> 21:06.141
You see, walking forces water into the mouth
from which it flows over the gills.

21:10.394 --> 21:13.464
Uh, as the water
traverses past the gills...

21:13.564 --> 21:17.635
fine blood vessels on the surface
of the gills release the carbon dioxide...

21:17.735 --> 21:20.304
and pick up a dissolved oxygen
from the water...

21:20.404 --> 21:23.557
- which exits from the fish through the gill-slit.
- I see.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.559
Well, do you think it will work
in this particular case?

21:25.659 --> 21:27.144
Well, I'm no prophet.

21:27.244 --> 21:30.874
Well, thank you very much
for talking to us, Miss Dobson.

21:32.166 --> 21:34.443
How does it look, Joe?

21:34.543 --> 21:36.921
Can't tell yet, Lou.

21:56.398 --> 22:00.094
- How long has he been walkin' this thing?
- About two hours.

22:00.194 --> 22:01.992
What a way to make a living.

22:17.378 --> 22:20.823
- His arm.
- I saw it. It did move.

22:20.923 --> 22:23.927
Watch it up there.
He's starting to move.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.714
- Why doesn't he get out?
- Get those ropes ready.

22:36.814 --> 22:39.467
I want to get out of here
as soon as I get a line on him.

22:39.567 --> 22:41.444
We're ready, Joe.

22:47.741 --> 22:50.478
Get a shot of this!
Get that camera here, quick!

22:50.578 --> 22:52.563
He'll get out of the tank!

22:52.663 --> 22:55.232
- Keep that net handy. I may need it.
- We'll have it when you do.

22:55.332 --> 22:57.109
All right, stand by
with those boat-hooks, boys.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.462
That thing will kill somebody.

23:01.255 --> 23:02.848
Look out!

23:15.769 --> 23:18.047
- Joe, look, he's climbing out.
- Look out, Joe.

23:18.147 --> 23:19.840
Give me that.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.783
Be careful!

23:24.236 --> 23:26.013
Joe! Careful!

23:26.113 --> 23:27.535
Watch out!

23:29.408 --> 23:30.125
Joe!

23:37.458 --> 23:39.552
Get him out of there!

23:41.420 --> 23:43.343
Get the net ready!

23:46.592 --> 23:49.220
Throw the net! Throw the net!

24:00.940 --> 24:03.034
Bring him over here, Joe.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.891
Okay, I've got his wrist.

24:10.991 --> 24:13.602
- Get those cuts fixed up right away.
- All right, all right.

24:13.702 --> 24:16.205
Let's get out of here
before that thing breaks loose again.

24:26.882 --> 24:29.368
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
our Ocean Harbor technicians...</i>

24:29.468 --> 24:33.873
<i>are about to move the Gill Man from the
receiving tank into the larger permanent tank.</i>

24:33.973 --> 24:38.274
- <i>Mr. Joe Hayes is in charge of the operation.</i>
- Open up the gate.

26:10.277 --> 26:11.971
Everything all right?

26:12.071 --> 26:15.432
Wait till they're all out of the tank.
I'm not taking any chances.

26:15.532 --> 26:17.284
Okay.

26:41.850 --> 26:45.571
- I hope that chain holds.
- Don't worry about that chain.

26:58.742 --> 27:01.478
<i>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to Ocean Harbor...</i>

27:01.578 --> 27:06.191
<i>on this, the first day of public exhibit
of the world-famous Gill Man.</i>

27:06.291 --> 27:10.112
<i>We suggest that you enjoy all of the sights
the oceanarium has to offer.</i>

27:10.212 --> 27:12.865
<i>Once you've seen the Gill Man,
please move on.</i>

27:12.965 --> 27:14.908
<i>Give the other folks a chance.</i>

27:15.008 --> 27:17.494
<i>Our attendants will be pleased
to answer your questions...</i>

27:17.594 --> 27:21.224
<i>as you tour the wonders of the deep.</i>

28:12.774 --> 28:15.344
<i>Very shortly now
the Gill Man will be fed.</i>

28:15.444 --> 28:18.388
<i>Scientists are still
investigating his diet.</i>

28:18.488 --> 28:20.641
<i>They found the creature
reluctant to eat these fish...</i>

28:20.741 --> 28:23.836
<i>That are swimming about him in the tank.</i>

28:44.848 --> 28:47.601
It was a real break finding you here.

28:48.101 --> 28:52.756
Look, I'm not one of those specialists who
fails to appreciate the other fella's field.

28:52.856 --> 28:55.217
Although, personally,
I think we're overspecialized.

28:55.317 --> 28:57.261
Why, it's getting so we have experts...

28:57.361 --> 29:01.056
who concentrate only on the lower section
of a specimen's left ear.

29:01.156 --> 29:04.393
Well, I must tell you,
I know something about your work.

29:04.493 --> 29:07.688
And I was quite impressed
when I heard you were coming.

29:07.788 --> 29:10.482
You're not at all like I expected.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.835
I'm glad I disappointed you.

30:29.286 --> 30:31.960
He's not much on table manners, is he?

30:32.706 --> 30:34.942
Come on, let's get out of here
before the crowd runs over us.

30:35.042 --> 30:36.902
All right.

30:37.002 --> 30:38.904
What are you doing for dinner tonight?

30:39.004 --> 30:42.032
- You don't waste any time, do you?
- I've only got two weeks.

30:42.132 --> 30:43.617
But you came here to work.

30:43.717 --> 30:45.869
Any time a man can combine
business with pleasure...

30:45.969 --> 30:48.267
he's batting 500 in my league.

31:02.736 --> 31:04.972
And now, I'll start all over again.

31:05.072 --> 31:07.432
Miss Dobson, what are you doing
for dinner tonight?

31:07.532 --> 31:09.977
Well, I hadn't thought about it, sir.

31:10.077 --> 31:12.646
Then that's settled.
Now where are you staying?

31:12.746 --> 31:15.065
- At the Star Motel.
- Great. So am I.

31:15.165 --> 31:17.067
Hey, Professor!

31:17.167 --> 31:19.278
Wait for me!

31:19.378 --> 31:21.780
Uh-oh, I've been afraid of this.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.907
That Joe Hayes is an a-number-one wolf.

31:24.007 --> 31:26.034
Avoid him. It'll be difficult,
but it can be done.

31:26.134 --> 31:28.745
Well, aren't you gonna wait for him?

31:28.845 --> 31:31.248
What? And let Mr. America
cut into my cake?

31:31.348 --> 31:33.750
What's the matter, old-timer,
pooped out?

31:33.850 --> 31:36.920
You shouldn't walk these brain-boys
so fast. They can't take it.

31:37.020 --> 31:39.840
You know, strong upstairs,
but no stamina.

31:39.940 --> 31:41.717
It's good to see you, Clete.
I heard you were in town.

31:41.817 --> 31:42.634
You too.

31:42.734 --> 31:45.387
I understand you're gonna be here
for a couple of weeks.

31:45.487 --> 31:47.597
- Yeah, that's right.
- Ah, that's tough.

31:47.697 --> 31:50.475
You won't have the chance
to enjoy the good things in life.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.228
- And what are you doing for dinner tonight?
- Well, I, uh...

31:53.328 --> 31:57.649
Uh, sorry, Joe, she just made
a date with me, didn't you?

31:57.749 --> 32:00.798
Well, I... Well, yes.

32:02.045 --> 32:04.865
Oh, but you can join us, Joe,
if you want to.

32:04.965 --> 32:07.576
No, thanks.
I'll give the professor his chance.

32:07.676 --> 32:10.287
I don't like to take advantage
of amateurs.

32:10.387 --> 32:12.185
See you later.

32:15.934 --> 32:20.360
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, introducing Flippy,
the educated porpoise.</i>

32:28.530 --> 32:32.080
Flippy has been taught
to retrieve objects on command.

32:39.916 --> 32:44.467
<i>And now, for a finale,
Flippy will raise the flag.</i>

33:06.818 --> 33:09.221
Well, where have you been, boy?

33:09.321 --> 33:12.599
I guess I better introduce you.
Professor, this is Chris.

33:12.699 --> 33:15.977
My one true love and favorite boyfriend.

33:16.077 --> 33:17.437
Pleased to meet you, sir.

33:17.537 --> 33:19.439
Well, it's all right, boy.
He won't bite you.

33:19.539 --> 33:21.400
Ah, come on, boy.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.569
Say, you're a good old dog.

33:24.669 --> 33:26.613
- Does he always travel with you?
- No, no.

33:26.713 --> 33:29.866
He picked me up a couple of weeks ago.
I was here watching the porpoises...

33:29.966 --> 33:33.516
and he made a pass at me,
didn't you, boy?

33:46.274 --> 33:49.219
If Flippy gets any smarter,
he'll start talking.

33:49.319 --> 33:50.679
He talks, all right.

33:50.779 --> 33:53.056
We're just not smart enough
to understand him.

33:53.156 --> 33:55.434
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:55.534 --> 33:59.354
- Think Chris is smarter than Flippy, Professor?
- I doubt it.

33:59.454 --> 34:02.274
The porpoise has a very large
and well-developed brain.

34:02.374 --> 34:07.154
In fact, his intelligence lies somewhere
between a chimpanzee and a dog.

34:07.254 --> 34:11.116
- How smart is the Gill Man?
- Well, that's what I'm here to find out.

34:11.216 --> 34:14.327
What his reflexes are like.
His behavior patterns.

34:14.427 --> 34:17.205
His capacity to learn.
His response to stimuli.

34:17.304 --> 34:20.500
Oh, it sounds exciting.
I hope I'll be able to help.

34:20.600 --> 34:23.085
Thanks. I'm sure you will.

34:23.186 --> 34:25.029
<i>Here we go.</i>

34:26.565 --> 34:29.634
<i>Okay, once more. Back again.</i>

34:29.734 --> 34:33.534
<i>All right, Flippy, you may now return
to your private quarters, and thank you.</i>

34:35.574 --> 34:39.829
<i>Testing. One, two, three, four.</i>

34:41.496 --> 34:45.170
<i>Testing. One, two, three, four.</i>

34:46.960 --> 34:50.885
<i>Testing. One, two, three, four.</i>

34:54.634 --> 34:58.184
<i>Testing. One, two, three, four.</i>

35:03.852 --> 35:07.573
<i>Testing. One, two, three, four.</i>

35:08.106 --> 35:12.156
<i>The speaker must be working.
He's reacting to it down there.</i>

35:16.239 --> 35:19.493
Be sure your throat mike is tight.

35:26.291 --> 35:29.261
- Be sure and keep that volume up.
- Yes, sir.

35:32.213 --> 35:35.283
Now the important thing is not to become
so interested you get careless.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.702
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.

35:37.802 --> 35:41.289
If anything goes wrong, you head straight
for the surface, you understand?

35:41.389 --> 35:43.391
All right, let's go.

35:48.188 --> 35:50.632
I sure hate to use this...

35:50.732 --> 35:52.717
but I guess we haven't much choice.

35:52.817 --> 35:55.762
All right now,
let's go over it once more.

35:55.862 --> 35:59.474
You're to wait for the right moment
and then push the food cage within his reach.

35:59.574 --> 36:02.561
As he reaches for it, you're to say "stop"
in your throat microphone.

36:02.661 --> 36:06.189
He won't know what it means, so I'll condition
him by shocking him with the bull-prod.

36:06.289 --> 36:07.941
- Right?
- Right.

36:08.041 --> 36:11.045
Bob, hand me this
when I get in the water, will you?

37:04.806 --> 37:07.275
Here he comes. Be careful, Clete.

37:12.355 --> 37:16.718
That was lesson number one.
He knows the prod can hurt him.

37:16.818 --> 37:20.618
- Put the cage down and stay close to the wall.
- Right.

37:38.339 --> 37:41.993
He's a little gun-shy.
You better attract his attention.

37:42.093 --> 37:45.142
- Jiggle the cover, Helen.
- Okay.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.530
Get back, Helen! Here he comes.

38:04.657 --> 38:07.160
- Now.
- Stop.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.041
Stop.

38:18.671 --> 38:20.173
Stop.

38:31.518 --> 38:32.986
Stop.

38:38.024 --> 38:41.010
He's learning fast.
Shall we try it again?

38:41.110 --> 38:43.972
No, that's enough for now.
Let's take the cage up.

38:44.072 --> 38:47.372
From now on, we're the only ones
who'll feed him.

39:18.314 --> 39:21.676
That was fine.
Now you better get out of that rig.

39:21.776 --> 39:24.575
Remember, we have a date
for dinner tonight.

40:14.537 --> 40:17.190
- Hi.
- I don't care what the joke writers say.

40:17.290 --> 40:20.735
It takes longer for a man to dress.
He's got more to put on.

40:20.835 --> 40:23.321
- How's he doin'?
- Fine.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.924
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- All right.

40:47.487 --> 40:50.765
- Here's the Mickey Finn, Professor.
- Good.

40:50.865 --> 40:53.309
Takes about five minutes
for this stuff to work.

40:53.409 --> 40:56.354
- Then he'll be gentle as a baby.
- I suppose.

40:56.454 --> 41:00.504
Fine scientist you are,
getting squeamish about doping a fish.

41:21.729 --> 41:23.527
He's got it.

42:20.329 --> 42:22.878
- Let's go.
- Right.

43:36.030 --> 43:38.182
Hey, what goes on here?

43:38.282 --> 43:42.687
Oh, well... every second,
millions of electric impulses...

43:42.787 --> 43:45.023
leap from one cell
of the brain to another...

43:45.123 --> 43:47.984
making our minds and moods
what they are.

43:48.084 --> 43:49.902
You see, those wires on the Gill Man...

43:50.002 --> 43:52.864
pick up these impulses
and register them here on the chart.

43:52.964 --> 43:55.533
- Yeah.
- Naturally, we'd learn a lot more about him...

43:55.633 --> 43:57.744
if we could test him while he was awake.

43:57.844 --> 44:01.539
Well, my dear girl, everybody knows that
when you're asleep the brain stops working.

44:01.639 --> 44:03.583
No more so than the heart does.

44:03.683 --> 44:07.670
The brain waves become irregular,
like those of the insane.

44:07.770 --> 44:12.742
- You mean, I'm crazy when I'm asleep?
- No more so than when you're awake.

44:58.696 --> 45:02.621
Red corpuscle content
only 10 percent less than human blood.

45:03.743 --> 45:06.212
Un-nucleated structure.

45:08.539 --> 45:11.213
No correlation with the fish sample.

45:13.044 --> 45:15.071
It's amazing.

45:15.171 --> 45:19.426
Every test, every reaction
just misses being human.

45:26.098 --> 45:28.042
Back again, boy?

45:28.142 --> 45:31.963
Say, you're like a proverbial kid brother
trying to mooch a nickel.

45:32.063 --> 45:33.485
There.

45:34.899 --> 45:37.093
Well, what's the matter, boy,
you worn out?

45:37.193 --> 45:39.262
Wouldn't you be by now?

45:39.362 --> 45:41.264
Here, boy. Fetch.

45:41.364 --> 45:43.683
Fetch it, boy. Fetch it.

45:43.783 --> 45:45.660
He's a character.

45:49.622 --> 45:52.191
It's nice to get away, lie in the sun...

45:52.291 --> 45:54.110
be like other people.

45:54.210 --> 45:57.071
Strange talk coming
from a dedicated scientist.

45:57.171 --> 46:00.095
Have you forgotten your mission in life?

46:00.883 --> 46:04.478
I'll be leaving soon.
I'm gonna miss you.

46:06.639 --> 46:10.626
You know, sometimes I wonder
how I ever got started in all this.

46:10.726 --> 46:13.838
Science, fish, ichthyology.

46:13.938 --> 46:17.592
Where will it all lead me,
as a person, I mean?

46:17.692 --> 46:20.136
Most of the kids I went
to undergraduate school with...

46:20.236 --> 46:23.331
- are already married and have children.
- Is that what you want?

46:25.074 --> 46:29.103
I don't know. I... I just don't know.

46:29.203 --> 46:31.689
- But surely...
- But what do you want?

46:31.789 --> 46:33.274
Well, it's different with me.

46:33.374 --> 46:36.527
- I'm a man, I don't have to make a choice.
- But I do?

46:36.627 --> 46:40.114
It's tough on you gals.
I'm not saying it's right or wrong.

46:40.214 --> 46:43.201
- Just a fact.
- It doesn't seem right.

46:43.301 --> 46:47.163
But you haven't told me what you want.
What you want most, I mean.

46:47.263 --> 46:52.064
I'd like to know before I leave.
You've become important to me.

46:52.643 --> 46:54.111
Very?

47:01.527 --> 47:04.030
Dog, you're a point-killer.

47:56.624 --> 47:59.047
Hey, take it easy.

47:59.960 --> 48:02.839
- You startled me.
- I'm sorry.

48:03.631 --> 48:06.242
You know, I pity him sometimes.

48:06.342 --> 48:10.579
He's so alone.
The only one of his kind in the world.

48:10.679 --> 48:13.791
Well, he's like an orphan of time.

48:13.891 --> 48:17.545
Yeah, I've been thinking about it.
Your going into the tank...

48:17.645 --> 48:19.088
it's risky, too risky.

48:19.188 --> 48:21.799
I'd sleep better if you'd leave him
to Joe and me.

48:21.899 --> 48:23.718
Well, haven't I been a help?

48:23.818 --> 48:26.178
That's not what
I'm talking about. It's...

48:26.278 --> 48:29.223
Well, it's just that he's
so unpredictable.

48:29.323 --> 48:32.351
- If anything were to happen...
- Nothing's going to happen.

48:32.451 --> 48:34.812
Don't you think you're making
a lot out of nothing?

48:34.912 --> 48:37.732
- He's chained and you have the bull-prod.
- Will you listen?

48:37.832 --> 48:39.900
You're only going to be here
a short time...

48:40.000 --> 48:42.844
and using Joe might hold you up.

49:09.447 --> 49:13.601
- Move the ball around.
- You gave him a bad jolt last time. He's leery.

49:13.701 --> 49:16.204
That's all right. Try it again.

49:38.726 --> 49:40.979
Careful, Helen. Careful.

50:04.418 --> 50:06.045
Stop.

50:20.351 --> 50:25.152
That's amazing. It took me three weeks
to teach that to a chimp.

50:26.023 --> 50:27.758
Let's try it again.

50:27.858 --> 50:30.611
- Okay?
- Okay, Professor.

50:36.325 --> 50:38.077
Come on.

50:49.421 --> 50:51.699
Come on. Come on.

50:51.799 --> 50:54.518
Be careful, Helen. Not too close.

50:56.262 --> 50:58.014
Come on.

51:00.307 --> 51:02.435
Helen! Get back, Helen!

51:03.602 --> 51:07.277
Stop! Clete! Clete!

51:12.820 --> 51:14.037
Clete!

51:15.114 --> 51:17.492
Get out, Helen! Get out!

51:18.033 --> 51:20.186
- Clete!
- Helen, stand back.

51:20.286 --> 51:21.663
Clete!

51:24.290 --> 51:25.963
Stop.

51:28.335 --> 51:29.882
Stop.

51:32.381 --> 51:34.099
Stop.

52:08.626 --> 52:11.779
- What happened, Clete? You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

52:11.879 --> 52:14.803
Lou, come here quick
and give Helen a hand.

52:16.216 --> 52:18.765
- You all right, Helen?
- Yeah.

52:30.147 --> 52:32.900
He's plenty mad. Let's get outta here.

53:08.977 --> 53:11.275
Hey look, he broke the chain!

53:15.484 --> 53:19.205
Stand clear. Get back, all of you.
Get back. Stand clear.

53:21.281 --> 53:22.453
Joe!

53:55.858 --> 53:59.261
<i>This is an emergency.
The Gill Man has escaped.</i>

53:59.361 --> 54:03.082
<i>Please! Please clear the oceanarium.
Get out, everybody.</i>

54:06.994 --> 54:11.295
<i>The Gill Man has broken out of his tank.
Clear the area.</i>

54:16.462 --> 54:18.180
Mommy!

54:20.716 --> 54:23.994
<i>Return to your cars. Don't approach
the beach side of the ocean.</i>

54:24.094 --> 54:27.189
<i>He'll probably be heading
toward the water.</i>

55:36.792 --> 55:39.111
It is four days since
the Gill Man escaped.

55:39.211 --> 55:43.157
Conflicting reports place the fearsome
creature as far north as Norfolk, Virginia...

55:43.257 --> 55:44.992
and as far south as Panama.

55:45.092 --> 55:50.019
But most experts believe the monster is
either dead or on its way back to the Amazon.

56:08.949 --> 56:12.644
- Come on, kids. Break it up.
- We weren't doing anything.

56:12.744 --> 56:15.022
Well, that's good. It's time to go home.

56:15.122 --> 56:18.525
- Come on, beat it.
- Okay, Officer. Okay.

56:18.625 --> 56:20.627
Anything you say.

58:28.422 --> 58:30.908
Helen! Are you all right?

58:31.008 --> 58:32.430
Helen!

58:36.596 --> 58:38.269
Chris?

58:43.395 --> 58:45.489
Helen, you all right?

58:46.857 --> 58:48.926
- Helen!
- Who is it?

58:49.026 --> 58:51.219
Clete. Where's Chris?

58:51.319 --> 58:54.014
Well, I left him in the bedroom.
Isn't he there?

58:54.114 --> 58:56.224
No. I heard him howl.

58:56.324 --> 59:00.329
- Well, I'll be right with you.
- I'll look for him outside.

59:05.417 --> 59:08.341
Chris? Here, boy.

59:10.505 --> 59:12.348
Here, Chris!

59:12.966 --> 59:14.593
Here, boy!

59:18.805 --> 59:20.603
Here, Chris.

59:28.356 --> 59:30.324
Any sign of him?

59:32.319 --> 59:34.638
Well, I wonder where he could be.

59:34.738 --> 59:37.516
Ah, don't worry about him.
He's probably chasing a rabbit.

59:37.616 --> 59:40.335
He'll show up in the morning. Come on.

59:41.328 --> 59:43.981
I'm glad you're coming with me tomorrow.

59:44.081 --> 59:48.276
We can take a leisurely cruise up the river
and have dinner in Jacksonville.

59:48.376 --> 59:50.070
My plane doesn't leave until midnight...

59:50.170 --> 59:53.156
so maybe we can go stepping
for a couple of hours, if you like.

59:53.256 --> 59:55.033
Oh, it sounds wonderful.

59:55.133 --> 59:59.479
- Will you miss me?
- It'll be the longest three months.

01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:18.306
- Good-bye, Helen. Good-bye, Clete.
- Good-bye.

01:00:18.406 --> 01:00:20.600
- See you, George. Thanks a lot.
- Have a nice trip.

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.686
- Sorry about everything that happened.
- Bye.

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:24.413
Bye, fellas.

01:01:21.428 --> 01:01:24.122
Now stop worrying about Chris.

01:01:24.222 --> 01:01:27.125
It's not like him to take off like that.

01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:30.837
Look, he'll probably be waiting for you
on your doorstep when you get home.

01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:32.610
I hope so.

01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:36.468
For a scientist,
I sure am a sentimental fool.

01:01:36.568 --> 01:01:38.303
Stay that way.

01:01:38.403 --> 01:01:40.906
Come on now. Let's enjoy the trip.

01:02:32.457 --> 01:02:37.237
- Sure there's nothing I can do to help?
- Everything checks, but nothing works.

01:02:37.337 --> 01:02:39.197
- Well, yell if you need me.
- Okay.

01:02:39.297 --> 01:02:40.448
- Ready?
- Sure.

01:02:40.548 --> 01:02:41.174
Let's go.

01:03:21.548 --> 01:03:23.658
Hey, cut it out.

01:03:23.758 --> 01:03:27.103
So you want to play, huh? That does it.

01:04:27.322 --> 01:04:30.183
Try to pull my leg, will you?

01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:32.978
For a professor, you certainly have
the manners of a freshman.

01:04:33.078 --> 01:04:37.816
Hey, Professor, come on back.
It's all fixed.

01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:39.839
Fun's over.

01:05:26.714 --> 01:05:30.184
- Did you have fun?
- Oh, yes, it was wonderful.

01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:33.471
- We better get going.
- Okay.

01:06:26.691 --> 01:06:30.070
- It's hot. Let's go outside.
- All right.

01:06:44.751 --> 01:06:48.029
Well, Prince Charming
vanishes at midnight...

01:06:48.129 --> 01:06:51.116
and I won't see him
for three long months.

01:06:51.216 --> 01:06:53.576
Maybe I can stretch a weekend.

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:56.520
Might as well be broke,
it's the way I am.

01:06:57.555 --> 01:06:59.999
You know, scientists are funny.

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:02.794
We probe and measure and dissect.

01:07:02.894 --> 01:07:07.741
Invent lights without heat,
weigh a caterpillar's eyebrow.

01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:11.970
But when it comes to really important things,
we're as stupid as the caveman.

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:15.557
- Important?
- Like love.

01:07:15.657 --> 01:07:19.352
Makes the world go round,
but what do we know about it?

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:23.082
Is it a fact?
Is it chemistry, electricity?

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:28.903
Once when I had a crush on the captain
of the high school football team...

01:07:29.003 --> 01:07:31.281
I looked it up in the dictionary.

01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:33.741
And love, according to Mr. Webster...

01:07:33.841 --> 01:07:39.873
is "a feeling of strong personal attachment
induced by sympathetic understanding."

01:07:39.973 --> 01:07:42.726
Have you ever heard such nonsense?

01:07:43.351 --> 01:07:45.128
I don't know.

01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:48.298
Some things should remain unknown.

01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:51.176
I think a poet once said:

01:07:51.276 --> 01:07:55.597
"But love is such a mystery,
I cannot find it out.

01:07:55.697 --> 01:08:00.669
For when I think I'm best resolved,
I then am most in doubt."

01:09:43.261 --> 01:09:44.559
Helen!

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:48.609
- Help!
- Helen!

01:09:49.935 --> 01:09:51.421
- Help!
- What was that?

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.194
I don't know.

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:03.332
Helen!

01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:22.910
<i>The Gill Man has kidnapped
a woman from the Lobster House...</i>

01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:24.912
<i>at the foot of Pier Nine.</i>

01:10:25.012 --> 01:10:30.418
Pier Nine. Units one, seven,
alerted to Pier Nine.

01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:32.191
That's us.

01:10:41.279 --> 01:10:43.031
Helen!

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.187
Man in the water by the buoy.

01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:52.757
Over here! Here!

01:11:04.802 --> 01:11:07.538
67... This is a 67.

01:11:07.638 --> 01:11:11.042
<i>Clear the streets of traffic.
Order citizens indoors.</i>

01:11:11.142 --> 01:11:15.864
<i>Police cars on detail nine-one
will report to waterfront.</i>

01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:30.561
The Gill Man is loose in Jacksonville...

01:11:30.661 --> 01:11:33.606
after kidnapping Miss Helen Dobson,
a science student.

01:11:33.706 --> 01:11:37.443
It is believed the monster may be
on the prowl, ready to attack others.

01:11:37.543 --> 01:11:39.821
The police have requested us
to advise all citizens...

01:11:39.921 --> 01:11:42.407
to remain indoors until further notice.

01:11:42.507 --> 01:11:44.659
It is suggested that you keep
all lights on...

01:11:44.759 --> 01:11:47.478
as the creature seems not to be able
to stand bright light.

01:11:53.226 --> 01:11:56.671
So I say to the old man,
"Why should I stay in school?

01:11:56.771 --> 01:11:58.673
You never finished
and you're doing okay."

01:11:58.773 --> 01:12:02.385
- You can't get a job without a college degree.
- It's like my pop says it.

01:12:02.485 --> 01:12:05.388
"A college degree is like
a high school diploma used to be."

01:12:05.488 --> 01:12:07.957
He says... Hey.

01:12:08.866 --> 01:12:09.934
What's that?

01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:13.730
Looks like a body's been washed ashore.

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:16.424
- Think we'd better...
- Yeah.

01:12:47.113 --> 01:12:49.741
- Is she all right?
- She's alive.

01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:56.547
No! No!

01:13:14.265 --> 01:13:19.045
<i>Car two-four, the report
from area 78 is incorrect.</i>

01:13:19.145 --> 01:13:22.006
<i>Got it? It is incorrect.</i>

01:13:22.106 --> 01:13:25.218
<i>The Gill Man has not
been sighted in that area.</i>

01:13:25.318 --> 01:13:28.471
- He could be headed for Brazil by now.
- Yeah.

01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:32.725
The bodies of two men have been found
on the banks of the Saint John's River.

01:13:32.825 --> 01:13:38.648
Car one-nine investigate bodies
found near car below Point Diego.

01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:40.967
Could be him. Let's go.

01:14:07.652 --> 01:14:11.702
- Get a load of that.
- There's another one over there.

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:14.413
Look!

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:25.444
All emergency equipment
is being mobilized at Point Diego...

01:14:25.544 --> 01:14:29.115
where the bodies of two students,
victims of the Gill Man, were found.

01:14:29.215 --> 01:14:31.576
So far there has been
no trace of Miss Helen Dobson...

01:14:31.676 --> 01:14:34.328
the pretty, young scientist
kidnapped by the monster.

01:14:34.428 --> 01:14:38.291
Her fiancé, Professor Clete Ferguson,
is aiding in the search.

01:14:38.391 --> 01:14:40.626
The police department
asked me to repeat this message.

01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:45.756
Civil defense trucks and floodlight
equipment will report to Point Diego.

01:14:45.856 --> 01:14:48.759
All right men, settle down
and give me your attention.

01:14:48.859 --> 01:14:52.263
I want you to comb this beach
and surrounding area carefully...

01:14:52.363 --> 01:14:55.308
but under no circumstances
are any of you to investigate...

01:14:55.408 --> 01:14:58.644
shrubbery, hulks or other
possible places of concealment...

01:14:58.744 --> 01:15:01.939
unless you are accompanied
by an armed guard.

01:15:02.039 --> 01:15:04.442
Now the trucks will disperse
in both directions...

01:15:04.542 --> 01:15:07.570
and unload about a thousand yards apart.

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:10.031
Now you men all have flashlights.

01:15:10.131 --> 01:15:13.409
I want you to check them right now
to see whether they're in order or not.

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:16.058
All right, come on. Turn 'em on.

01:15:18.597 --> 01:15:20.249
Good.

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:23.878
Now if any of you spot the Gill Man,
report to your group leader.

01:15:23.978 --> 01:15:27.632
He'll fire his Very pistol and the professor
and I will get there as soon as possible.

01:15:27.732 --> 01:15:30.509
May I say something to the men, Captain?

01:15:30.609 --> 01:15:33.704
Professor Ferguson would like
to say something to you.

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:40.561
I want to impress upon you once again
something the captain said before.

01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:43.522
Don't take any chances.

01:15:43.622 --> 01:15:46.025
This is a thinking creature
we're hunting.

01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:50.363
Wily, cruel, dangerous.
As strong as any ten of you.

01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:53.115
Two men have already lost
their lives tonight.

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:55.368
A girl is missing.

01:15:55.468 --> 01:15:59.538
I want to find that girl alive
more than anything else in the world...

01:15:59.638 --> 01:16:04.460
but I don't want a single one of you men
to risk your life needlessly.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:08.965
Remember that this creature can't stay
out of the water for more than a few minutes.

01:16:09.065 --> 01:16:12.051
That limits our search
to a narrow strip along the river.

01:16:12.151 --> 01:16:17.640
So, please, obey the captain's
instructions to the letter.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:21.936
The moment you spot the Gill Man,
report it to your group leader...

01:16:22.036 --> 01:16:24.539
and he'll fire his Very pistol.

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:28.543
That's it, men. Get at it.

01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:51.634
Hold it!

01:17:52.835 --> 01:17:56.489
Joe, turn that light back.
I think I saw something.

01:17:56.589 --> 01:17:59.217
Anything to make you happy, Mac.

01:18:04.388 --> 01:18:05.915
Hold it.

01:18:06.015 --> 01:18:08.542
I knew I saw something.

01:18:08.642 --> 01:18:11.962
I can't make it out,
but that's no Gill Man, bub.

01:18:12.062 --> 01:18:14.507
It's not driftwood either, buster.

01:18:14.607 --> 01:18:16.826
I'm gonna take a look-see.

01:18:19.153 --> 01:18:21.747
Any of you guys want to go with me?

01:18:22.239 --> 01:18:25.476
- Joe, keep this lamp right where it is.
- Right.

01:18:25.576 --> 01:18:29.297
- If you find anything, make with the high-sign.
- Yeah.

01:18:47.097 --> 01:18:48.440
Holy cow!

01:18:55.981 --> 01:18:59.110
A flea couldn't get
through there, Professor.

01:19:01.028 --> 01:19:03.827
- Hey, they found him.
- Let's move, boys.

01:19:44.738 --> 01:19:46.223
Remember your instructions.

01:19:46.323 --> 01:19:48.517
The professor is in command for now on.

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:50.836
You take orders from him.

01:20:04.091 --> 01:20:07.812
- There he goes.
- Watch out for the girl. Hold your fire!

01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:11.940
Stop!

01:20:14.268 --> 01:20:15.895
Stop!

01:20:18.355 --> 01:20:21.074
- Help!
- Stop!

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:25.447
- Help!
- Stop!

01:20:27.698 --> 01:20:29.200
Stop!

01:20:31.702 --> 01:20:34.876
Come toward me slowly.
Don't make any sudden moves.

01:20:35.873 --> 01:20:38.317
Steady. Hold your fire.

01:20:38.417 --> 01:20:40.920
Steady. That's it.
