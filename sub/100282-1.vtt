I mean, sure, a lot of girls
tickle my fancy,

I tickle any of theirs.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.972
I was wondering if I'd get
that hundred bucks you owe me.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.142
[Jimmy] I don't owe you
anything.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.143

10:45.145 --> 10:46.277
Yeah, one way or another

10:46.279 --> 10:47.345
you're gonna give it to me.

I'm not giving you anything.

are you looking at?

10:59.426 --> 11:02.027
Yo, man, why don't you
just leave the kid alone?

Won't you just mind
your own fucking business?

I just don't want
anyone to get hurt.

Listen, you are
the one who's gonna get hurt

11:09.369 --> 11:12.137
if you don't
shut your fucking mouth.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.138
Me?

11:13.140 --> 11:14.906
Oh, no, not me, man.

11:14.908 --> 11:15.974
It's you, trailer park,

Hey, you fat fuck,

I said I need my money.

I don't owe you anything.

You must wanna
get fucked up, don't you?

12:54.875 --> 12:56.875
I want my money.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.810
I don't have your money.

can get you patched up, okay?

[Jimmy] Okay.

Have a seat right here, son.

14:39.045 --> 14:42.881

-They are not my friends.
-Yeah.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.583

15:56.156 --> 15:57.288

15:57.290 --> 15:58.690
I'm okay. Um...

15:58.692 --> 15:59.958
At a friend's house.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.226
[Bobby] <i> Uh, what friend?</i>

16:02.228 --> 16:03.394
<i> You only have two.</i>

16:03.396 --> 16:05.096

16:06.433 --> 16:08.733
I'll explain later. I gotta go.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.436
[Bobby] <i> Okay.</i>
<i>Call me as soon as you get home.</i>

16:11.438 --> 16:15.173

16:35.061 --> 16:37.528
Look at me,
I'd get my ass kicked.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.263
Well, you just did.

16:41.001 --> 16:44.102
Hey, you know,

16:44.104 --> 16:46.704
I started boxing
when I was about your age.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.272
Really?

16:48.274 --> 16:50.375
Do you think
you could teach me or...?

16:51.378 --> 16:54.145
Me? Pfft. No, I really, really--

16:54.147 --> 16:57.715
No, I-- I understand.
I-- I shouldn't have asked.

16:58.651 --> 17:03.454
It's just that my boxing days
are long gone.

17:06.358 --> 17:09.027
But if you are serious,

17:09.029 --> 17:12.563
I think I know somebody
who might be able to help.

17:12.565 --> 17:15.233
Really? You know somebody
that could teach me to fight?

17:15.234 --> 17:16.601
To defend yourself.

17:18.104 --> 17:21.271
I think so.
You can check it out.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.674
I'd have to get
your parents' permission.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.478
Why don't I give you
a ride home?

17:28.214 --> 17:30.782
No, Mr. Jackson-- Action.

17:30.784 --> 17:33.151
-I'll be all right.
-[Action] Hey, it's no problem.

17:33.653 --> 17:36.154
I was headed out
to get some groceries anyway.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.332
Jimmy, your dinner is in--

17:49.235 --> 17:51.502
Oh, my God. What happened?

17:51.504 --> 17:52.603
Are you okay?

17:52.605 --> 17:54.505
Yeah, I'm-- I'm okay, Mom.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.541
Well, what the hell happened?

17:56.543 --> 17:59.677
Well, hello, Jimmy's mom.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.746
Jimmy got
into a little altercation

18:01.748 --> 18:03.448
with some hooligans
near my house.

18:03.450 --> 18:04.582
What hooligans?

18:04.584 --> 18:06.417
Just some boys from school.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.852
It was
outside Mr. Jackson's house

18:07.854 --> 18:09.620
on my way home.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.522
He came out and helped me.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.693
-Kathy.
-Clarence.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.595
You know, Kathy,
Jimmy here expressed

18:17.597 --> 18:19.864
some interest in maybe learning
how to defend himself

18:19.866 --> 18:23.367
and, well,
I thought maybe I could help.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.703
You patch my boy up?

18:25.705 --> 18:26.804
Yes, sir.

18:26.806 --> 18:31.375
I appreciate what you did,
but Jimmy will be fine.

18:31.377 --> 18:33.611
We can handle
everything from here.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.247
Well, okay.

18:38.585 --> 18:41.552
It was nice to meet you, Jimmy.
A real pleasure.

18:43.189 --> 18:44.222

Now, two jabs and a right.

white people before?

Good to see you too, Manny.

Why you gotta bring

too many times.

-I could use your help, Manny.
-Name it, brother.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.867
I was hoping
you could teach Jimmy here

20:02.869 --> 20:04.502
to defend himself.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.205
Looks like he could use it.

20:07.207 --> 20:10.341
And I'll do
anything for you, but..

20:10.343 --> 20:14.679
you probably don't wanna
bring a kid like this here.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.781

-No, no, no.

20:22.956 --> 20:26.257
but Jimmy here
is not one to run away.

20:26.259 --> 20:27.926
I witnessed it.

So you just let me worry
about that, okay?

21:22.548 --> 21:24.882
Yeah, to learn
how to defend myself.

21:24.884 --> 21:26.317
And once you know how to fight,

21:26.319 --> 21:28.486
doesn't mean
you go looking for trouble.

You're a big boy, Jimmy.

And I know you think
carrying that extra weight

Yeah.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.563
[Manny] Well, sometimes

22:12.565 --> 22:13.931
being well-rounded
is a good thing.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.802
All we gotta do is firm you up.

22:18.404 --> 22:20.805
You ever heard
of George Foreman?

What's America's youth
coming to?

22:24.977 --> 22:26.444
Yeah, the grill guy.

22:26.446 --> 22:28.612
But before he was the grill guy,

22:28.614 --> 22:31.082
he was two-time world champion

22:31.084 --> 22:34.618
knocking out Joe Frazier in 1973

22:34.620 --> 22:39.023
and then, 20 years
and many pounds later,

22:39.025 --> 22:41.058
to knock out Michael Moorer

22:41.060 --> 22:43.694
for the Heavyweight Championship
of the World.

-How?

22:46.899 --> 22:50.868
Yeah, that's how he got
into the grill business.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.770
George had to cook
all those hamburgers.

22:52.772 --> 22:55.973
He had a grill
in every room in his house.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.575
Manny.

22:57.577 --> 22:59.910
Well, could've happen that way.

22:59.912 --> 23:04.648
Anyway, George was a big boy,
and nobody messed with George.

23:05.551 --> 23:08.552
So sometimes
size could be a good thing.

24:45.551 --> 24:47.852
Well,
you could give him a hundred,

24:47.854 --> 24:51.555
but chances are, once he knows
you're good for it,

24:51.557 --> 24:54.258
he'll keep coming back
for more on a regular basis.

the hundred right now,

to leave you alone for good.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.363
How old are you, like 16 now?

27:12.365 --> 27:14.031
Even like this,
I can still kick your ass.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.666
Well, you gotta
catch me first, cupcake.

27:15.668 --> 27:17.267
Come on, come on.

27:22.708 --> 27:24.408
Good day, Mr. James.

27:24.410 --> 27:26.710
What's shaking?

27:26.712 --> 27:28.045
What's up, Bobby?

27:28.047 --> 27:30.347
So what's up
with you and Adrian?

27:30.349 --> 27:33.083
That freaky bitch
is hot for your body.

27:33.085 --> 27:34.818
[Jimmy chuckles]

27:34.820 --> 27:37.688
I think she needs glasses.

27:37.690 --> 27:40.858
James Mulligan,
you just cracked a funny.

27:40.860 --> 27:42.059
You okay?

27:42.061 --> 27:43.293
Got a headache? Lightheaded?

27:43.295 --> 27:44.862
Dizzy? Need to sit down?

27:44.864 --> 27:47.431
I'm okay,
but thanks for your concern.

27:47.433 --> 27:49.700
So seriously,
what's going on with you two?

27:49.702 --> 27:51.135
Nothing.

27:51.137 --> 27:52.987
Nothing?

27:52.988 --> 27:54.838
Dude, this chick
obviously likes you.

27:54.840 --> 27:58.308
And despite her satanic look,
she is kind of cute.

27:58.310 --> 28:00.944
You need to ask her out.

28:00.946 --> 28:02.946
Man, I just-- I don't think so.

28:02.948 --> 28:04.081
Why not?

28:04.984 --> 28:06.183
Oh, my God.

28:07.420 --> 28:09.353
You're gay and you want me.

28:09.355 --> 28:10.921
You wish.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.823
Aren't you supposed
to have class?

28:12.825 --> 28:16.460
Class?
I don't got no class at all.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.095
-Get out of here.
-Okay.

28:18.097 --> 28:21.098
But he who hesitates
is lost, James.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.469
Hey, Fatty McFat Fuck!

28:25.471 --> 28:27.471
Still waiting on the hundred
bucks you owe me.

28:27.473 --> 28:29.940
Listen, Miles, I couldn't get
your hundred bucks this week.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.192
What?

28:31.193 --> 28:32.443
But I just got
a really good after-school job.

28:32.445 --> 28:34.178
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah, yeah.

28:34.180 --> 28:37.815
And-- And if you just wait
a couple of weeks,

28:37.817 --> 28:40.050
instead of the hundred bucks
I owe you,

28:40.052 --> 28:41.752
I'll give you two hundred.

28:41.754 --> 28:42.886
Two hundred dollars.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.388
But you have to promise me

28:44.390 --> 28:46.290
you'll leave me alone
so I can get your money.

28:47.026 --> 28:49.126
Two hundred bucks
then I just live you alone?

28:49.128 --> 28:50.928
Yes.
I promise I'll give it to you.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.096
You really gonna give it to me?

28:52.098 --> 28:53.230
Yes.

28:56.268 --> 28:57.768
Okay, so.

28:58.838 --> 29:01.939

Okay, Jimmy.

29:21.293 --> 29:24.862
I know you've had a rough week,
right?

29:24.864 --> 29:26.830
Got the basics down.

29:26.832 --> 29:29.399
Now we're gonna work
on your strong point.

29:29.401 --> 29:32.302

We don't have time to teach you

29:32.304 --> 29:35.272

and sting like a bee.

Okay, now come on now.

29:58.230 --> 29:59.396

You might only have one chance

Okay, now come on.

30:03.836 --> 30:04.902

30:08.274 --> 30:09.473
I'm tired.

30:09.475 --> 30:10.474
Of course you're tired.

30:10.476 --> 30:11.375
This is hard work.

30:11.377 --> 30:12.276
Now come on.

30:12.278 --> 30:13.310
One time, harder.

30:14.814 --> 30:15.813
You know what?

30:15.815 --> 30:16.880
Give me three rounds

30:16.882 --> 30:18.282

30:24.456 --> 30:27.090
Look, I don't know
what's wrong with your boy.

30:27.927 --> 30:29.526
I don't think
he wants to be here.

30:30.362 --> 30:34.364
And friend or no friend,
I can't be wasting my time.

30:34.934 --> 30:37.534
I got too many kids in here
who wanna be here.

31:04.597 --> 31:06.630
You wanna tell me
what's going on?

31:07.900 --> 31:08.899
What do you mean?

31:09.501 --> 31:11.368
Come on, Jim,

31:11.370 --> 31:14.037
you were just going
through the emotions today.

31:14.974 --> 31:17.507
Remember, you asked me for this.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.411
I know, I shouldn't--

31:23.082 --> 31:24.648
I just--

31:24.650 --> 31:27.084
I don't think
that this is gonna work.

31:28.187 --> 31:32.022
I mean, look at me,
I'm fat, I'm tired.

31:32.024 --> 31:35.559
And then after all this, I might
just get my ass kicked again.

31:37.162 --> 31:38.195
Well...

31:39.365 --> 31:41.064
Well, you might.

31:43.068 --> 31:44.635
Then again you might not.

31:45.437 --> 31:47.971
Isn't that worth
working hard for?

like I'm getting any better.

Well, it's gonna
take some time, Jimmy.

don't wanna do this,

I wouldn't waste Mr. Jackson
and Manny's time.

to offer their help,

but not expect
anything in return.

how to defend myself

33:12.658 --> 33:14.391
when I was a kid.

33:14.393 --> 33:18.028
That way it would be
me teaching you.

33:18.030 --> 33:19.629
If you stick with this,

you can teach your kids some day

to go through

What could any of us do?

What the fuck
are you looking at?

40:50.048 --> 40:52.615
Okay, what--
What the hell just happened?

40:53.852 --> 40:55.518
I'll explain over lunch.

41:00.158 --> 41:02.792
Well, I don't have
an after-school job.

41:02.794 --> 41:06.095
What, you don't have--
You don't have a job?

41:06.097 --> 41:07.897
Didn't you just tell Miles

41:07.899 --> 41:09.799
that you were gonna pay him
his money next week?

41:09.801 --> 41:11.634
First off, it's not his money.

41:11.636 --> 41:13.536
Wait, if you
haven't been working,

41:13.538 --> 41:14.971
what the hell
have you been doing?

41:14.973 --> 41:16.673
Bobby and I
barely see you anymore.

41:20.512 --> 41:21.611
Boxing.

41:22.047 --> 41:23.847
I'm sorry, did you say boxing?

41:24.583 --> 41:25.682

41:26.918 --> 41:28.585
Do you remember that old man

41:28.587 --> 41:30.854
that I was telling you
and Bobby about?

41:30.856 --> 41:32.689
You know, the one that helped me

41:32.691 --> 41:34.491
when Miles Sucker
punched me on my way home.

41:34.493 --> 41:36.526
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

41:36.528 --> 41:40.029
Well, he used to be a boxer.

41:40.031 --> 41:42.899
His friend owns the gym,
and they've been training me.

41:44.803 --> 41:46.202
Well, that explains

41:46.204 --> 41:48.771
your recent love affair
with turkey.

41:48.773 --> 41:50.106
I thought you're just dieting

41:50.108 --> 41:51.708
so you could hook up
with Adrian.

41:51.710 --> 41:54.244
But I'd love
to hook up with Adrian.

41:54.246 --> 41:57.247
You have to ask me out
on a date first, Jimmy.

41:57.249 --> 41:58.548
Hi.

41:58.550 --> 42:00.684

having a party on Friday night.

-I got a date.

42:24.809 --> 42:28.011

-A date?

42:28.013 --> 42:30.613
And whom are you
going on this date with?

42:30.615 --> 42:32.549
And where might I ask
are you going?

42:32.551 --> 42:35.018
And how are you
getting there and back?

42:35.020 --> 42:37.086
And what time should
we expect you home tonight?

-Kathleen, leave the boy alone.

-Okay, okay. Is she a nice girl?

No, Mom, she's a horrible girl.

-But not too much fun.

-And don't drink or do drugs.

43:57.636 --> 43:59.702
-Kathleen.
-He's gonna knock her up.

No, no, thanks, bro. I'm good.

45:30.762 --> 45:32.295
Cool, cool.

All right, I gotta go
and make sure

46:03.995 --> 46:06.796
that nobody's having sex
in my dad's bed.

46:06.798 --> 46:08.965
Again.

46:08.967 --> 46:10.433

my room for that later.

a few pounds myself.

53:14.559 --> 53:15.691
Wear your wraps.

53:18.296 --> 53:20.296
What brings you
to our humble establishment?

53:21.199 --> 53:23.365
I don't know, something
seemed different about him,

53:23.367 --> 53:25.367
and I noticed that he lost
a few pounds,

53:25.369 --> 53:27.203
and the other night we were out
and he told me

53:27.205 --> 53:28.604
that he was gonna tell me
how he did it.

53:28.606 --> 53:30.272
But I thought we were going

53:30.274 --> 53:31.807
to go to a Weight Watchers
or something.

53:32.510 --> 53:35.277
Well,
you definitely lose weight here.

53:35.279 --> 53:36.745
[Action]
Adrian, did you ever think

53:36.747 --> 53:38.414
about learning
how to defend yourself?

53:38.416 --> 53:40.883
No, no, not really.

53:40.885 --> 53:43.452
But it would be nice
to learn how.

53:43.454 --> 53:44.920
I get my fair share
of rude comments,

53:44.922 --> 53:46.488
if you can imagine.

53:46.490 --> 53:48.991
But do boxing
and girls even mix?

53:48.993 --> 53:50.459
Ha.

53:50.461 --> 53:52.528
Hector, where's Rosie?

53:54.632 --> 53:56.232
[Hector] Yo, Rosie.

53:56.234 --> 53:57.266
Rosie.

53:58.469 --> 53:59.768
Manny's calling you.

54:01.572 --> 54:07.576
[rock music playing]

54:18.689 --> 54:20.723
Rosie, meet Adrian.

54:20.725 --> 54:22.858
-Hey, how you doing?
-Good. How are you?

54:24.562 --> 54:26.629
Hector, come here.

54:30.568 --> 54:33.002
Why don't you guys spar
just a couple of rounds, okay?

54:33.004 --> 54:35.504
No, Manny,
I don't wanna fight Rosie.

54:36.007 --> 54:37.539
[Manny] What? Are you scared?

54:38.909 --> 54:40.509
[Hector scoffs]

54:52.556 --> 54:53.956
Watch this.

55:25.389 --> 55:26.422
[Adrian chuckles]

55:26.424 --> 55:27.523
[Jimmy] What happened?

55:27.525 --> 55:29.558
[Action] Oh, nothing.

55:29.560 --> 55:32.961
Hector just got his ass
kicked by Rosie again.

55:34.432 --> 55:37.032
[Manny] See?
Boxing and girls do mix.

55:39.603 --> 55:41.503
Man, I was just
taking it easy on her.

55:41.505 --> 55:44.707
[Manny] I know. That's what
every guy she fights says.

55:44.709 --> 55:47.443
-[Hector] Whatever, man.
-[Manny laughs]

55:55.653 --> 55:57.019
All right.

55:58.689 --> 56:00.356
And you're not gonna
knock me down again

56:00.358 --> 56:01.857
in front of your girlfriend,
are you?

56:01.859 --> 56:03.892
[laughs]

56:04.695 --> 56:07.830
Okay, let's show
the young lady what you've got.

56:07.832 --> 56:09.031
Left jab.

56:09.033 --> 56:11.400
Left jab. Left jab, right hand.

56:11.402 --> 56:13.369
That's it. Jab, right hand.

56:13.371 --> 56:14.136
Whoa.

56:14.138 --> 56:15.971
Right hand. Whoa!

56:15.973 --> 56:17.906
Jab. Jab. Jab.

56:17.908 --> 56:19.074
Right hand.

56:19.076 --> 56:24.980
[cell phone buzzes and rings]

56:47.605 --> 56:49.471
Sit down.
Let me make you some breakfast.

56:49.974 --> 56:52.641
Uh, no, thanks, Mom.
I gotta head to the gym.

56:52.643 --> 56:54.810
But it's Sunday.
Shouldn't you rest a bit?

56:54.812 --> 56:57.846
I don't know, Mom.
I just feel really good today.

56:57.848 --> 56:59.815
-What's that?
-[Jimmy] Protein bar.

57:01.185 --> 57:03.952
Well, I gotta go.
I love you guys. I love you.

57:03.954 --> 57:04.887
I'll talk to you later.

57:04.889 --> 57:06.688
Be careful.

57:07.591 --> 57:09.658
Protein bar, huh?

57:09.660 --> 57:11.427
Maybe I should start eating
protein bars

57:11.429 --> 57:12.928
to give me a little more energy.

57:12.930 --> 57:14.096
You, Terrence Mulligan,

57:14.098 --> 57:15.864
don't need any more energy.

57:15.866 --> 57:17.800
Eat your pancakes.

57:18.569 --> 57:20.102
He's doing good though,
isn't he?

57:20.104 --> 57:21.703
Yeah, he is.

57:29.847 --> 57:31.146
[laughs]

57:31.148 --> 57:33.749
Wow, lookie, lookie who's here

in their step.

57:38.088 --> 57:39.721

57:39.723 --> 57:41.190
Couldn't be because
of that young lady

57:41.192 --> 57:42.658
we met yesterday, huh?

57:42.660 --> 57:44.726
[Manny laughs]

57:44.728 --> 57:46.829
All right, smiley,
I'm glad you popped in.

57:46.831 --> 57:49.231
I got somebody I want you
to work out with.

57:49.233 --> 57:50.666
So go wrap up.

[rock music plays]

58:28.739 --> 58:29.805
How you doing?

58:31.075 --> 58:32.074
Good.

58:36.747 --> 58:42.084
[hip-hop music plays]

58:47.892 --> 58:49.157

58:49.159 --> 58:50.192
Let's go. That's it.

58:50.194 --> 58:51.793
There you go.

58:53.264 --> 58:54.129
Hey.

58:54.131 --> 58:55.731
[chuckles]

58:58.168 --> 59:00.602
-What's up, champ?
-Uh...

59:01.939 --> 59:04.973
No, you're not
gonna spar with Marvin.

59:04.975 --> 59:06.208
-[chuckles]
-[Jimmy sighs]

59:09.580 --> 59:12.047
Hey, Marvin, come on
over here and meet Jimmy.

59:12.750 --> 59:13.882
[Marvin] How are you doing,
Jimmy?

59:13.884 --> 59:15.884
Better now.

59:15.886 --> 59:19.121
You sure you don't wanna
mix it up a little with Marvin?

59:19.123 --> 59:20.589
Come on up here.

59:21.992 --> 59:23.559
Ah, I'm just joking.

59:23.561 --> 59:24.293
Go on up.

59:25.963 --> 59:28.564
Hey, coach, it's the white boy
that knocked you out?

59:28.566 --> 59:30.966
Hey, I slipped, okay?

59:30.968 --> 59:33.201
Twenty-six fights,
I've never been knocked out.

59:33.203 --> 59:35.337
Now get it in there and work out
before I knock you out.

59:35.339 --> 59:36.838
Yeah, don't want to get arrested

59:36.840 --> 59:37.940
for beating up an old man.

59:37.942 --> 59:39.007
[laughs]

59:39.009 --> 59:39.975
I'll show you old man.

Whoo! Whoo!

-See you tomorrow, Manny.
-All right.

59:52.122 --> 59:54.890
Hey, Manny, I got your text.

59:54.892 --> 59:56.224
Did I miss anything?

59:56.226 --> 59:58.193
Look at you, all dressed up

59:58.195 --> 01:00:00.262

go-to-church clothes.

in the Silicon Valley.

[both chuckle]

01:00:05.836 --> 01:00:07.636
Did you say hello to God for me?

01:00:07.638 --> 01:00:09.871
Oh, yeah.
And I prayed for your ass.

01:00:09.873 --> 01:00:12.040
[Manny] Oh. What'd he say?

01:00:12.042 --> 01:00:14.376
Well, He said to say hello back

01:00:14.378 --> 01:00:19.281
and to tell you He's very pissed
about you ignoring Him.

01:00:20.017 --> 01:00:21.883
And, uh, oh, yeah,

01:00:21.885 --> 01:00:24.753
He said that He had a copy

01:00:24.755 --> 01:00:27.089
of your internet
browser history.

01:00:27.091 --> 01:00:28.991
Oh, no.

01:00:28.993 --> 01:00:33.028
Wait, you should have seen
the look on Jimmy's face

01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:35.998
when he thought he was gonna
have to spar with Marvin.

01:00:38.335 --> 01:00:39.868
Did you have
to get him a diaper?

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:41.770
Oh, two.

01:00:42.673 --> 01:00:44.873
I remember the time
you fought that big Colombian.

01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:47.275
-You needed a diaper.
-I needed two.

01:00:47.277 --> 01:00:48.810
You needed an assistant.

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:53.915
Manny, what did you think
of Jimmy's little lady friend?

01:00:54.852 --> 01:00:57.386
She is a nice
girl, but, uh, I'd hate

01:00:57.388 --> 01:01:00.055
to be behind her in an airport

01:01:00.057 --> 01:01:02.290
going through
the metal detector.

01:01:02.292 --> 01:01:04.126
I have to agree
with you on that.

01:01:04.128 --> 01:01:05.861
So, I'm ready when you are.

01:01:05.863 --> 01:01:08.664
[Manny] Okay.
What about our young protÃ©gÃ©?

01:01:10.968 --> 01:01:13.235
Ah, I see him. I'll go get him.

01:01:15.139 --> 01:01:16.772
Nice combo.

Hey, Action.

01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:22.444
Wow, looking
pretty snazzy today.

01:01:22.446 --> 01:01:25.914
Oh, I clean up
pretty well on occasion.

01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:27.249
Hey, come on over, Jimmy.

01:01:27.251 --> 01:01:29.384
There's somebody
Manny wants you to meet.

01:01:29.386 --> 01:01:30.919
[Manny] Defend your title, huh?

01:01:30.921 --> 01:01:32.087

You gonna be there?

01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:34.856
Oh, come on, I wouldn't miss it.

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:40.228
Jimmy, this is Dakila,
kind of like tequila,

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:43.465
only this guy
will really fuck you up.

01:01:43.467 --> 01:01:44.433
How you doing?

01:01:44.435 --> 01:01:45.400
Good, man.

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:49.938
Dakila is
a mixed martial artist.

01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:53.241
He's gonna show you
some basic moves

01:01:53.243 --> 01:01:55.043
while he's working out.

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:57.245
So, you're ready to go?

01:01:57.247 --> 01:01:58.346
Yeah, man.

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:02.851
Mixed martial arts is
a little different than boxing.

01:02:02.853 --> 01:02:04.920
Think of it a little
like a street fight

01:02:04.922 --> 01:02:06.888
where you also have to use
your elbows,

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:08.857
your knees and your legs.

01:02:09.326 --> 01:02:11.359
So I'm gonna show you
a couple of things to help you

01:02:11.361 --> 01:02:13.962
in a real fight, and we're
gonna have some fun, okay?

01:02:13.964 --> 01:02:15.230
Let's do it.

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:20.402
So, you got a cup on?

01:02:46.263 --> 01:02:48.230
-It's so good.
-Nobody watches this show.

01:02:51.168 --> 01:02:53.001
Happy fucking Monday.

01:02:53.003 --> 01:02:54.302
Yo, Slim.

01:02:55.506 --> 01:02:57.038
My buddy Eddie was telling me

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.840
you disrespected him
the other night.

01:02:59.309 --> 01:03:01.943
But he knows you and I
are business partners,

01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:03.111
so he'll spare you.

01:03:04.481 --> 01:03:08.917
Well, business partner,
I want my fucking money today.

01:03:08.919 --> 01:03:11.520
So rob a bank, borrow
from your loser fucking friends,

01:03:11.522 --> 01:03:13.188
I don't give a fuck,

01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:16.191
but I'm gonna be waiting
right here after school.

01:03:16.193 --> 01:03:18.226
So you better have
my two hundred bucks.

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:24.966

Now what?

01:03:37.347 --> 01:03:39.347
I guess I'll give him
what I own him.

01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:40.949
What the hell was that about?

01:03:40.951 --> 01:03:43.518
It's just-- It's a long story.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.821
I'll tell you about it at lunch.

01:03:45.823 --> 01:03:47.088
Where were you?

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:49.024
As far away as fucking possible.

[Jimmy] Good.

01:04:19.289 --> 01:04:21.556
Jimmy, right?

01:04:21.558 --> 01:04:22.257
[Jimmy] Yeah.

01:04:37.875 --> 01:04:40.208
So, I hear you may have
some issues

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:42.577
to resolve with that Miles kid
after school.

01:04:43.413 --> 01:04:45.080
[Jimmy] Yeah.

01:04:45.082 --> 01:04:46.248
He wants me to pay him

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:48.216
some money he says I owe him.

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:50.886
Well, do you?

01:04:52.022 --> 01:04:53.121
No.

01:04:55.993 --> 01:04:58.660
I also hear you've been
training over at Manny's.

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:01.563
You've been looking
pretty good lately.

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:03.398
How do you know that?

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.268
It's my business to know
what goes on in this school.

01:05:09.339 --> 01:05:11.406
Kick his fucking ass.

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:22.050
[teacher] The third angle
of any triangle

01:05:22.052 --> 01:05:24.419
when we know the angle
of the other two.

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:26.955
This works universally.

01:05:26.957 --> 01:05:30.959
So if you follow along
with me on the next page,

01:05:30.961 --> 01:05:34.329
take a look at the example
on the top right.

01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:37.132
You'll see that we are presented
with a triangle

01:05:37.134 --> 01:05:38.166
and two of its--

01:05:47.044 --> 01:05:49.711
And in the angles presented
in both examples,

01:05:49.713 --> 01:05:53.148
the sum of the angles
are the same for each example.

01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:57.452
And so the results
of the third angle is the same.

01:05:57.454 --> 01:05:58.720
The answer you should--

01:06:01.425 --> 01:06:05.627
[rock music plays]

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:08.229

01:06:08.231 --> 01:06:10.298
[siren wailing]

01:06:17.341 --> 01:06:19.274
Hey, Billy, how you doing?
It's Eddie.

01:06:19.276 --> 01:06:21.376
Listen, Miles needs a favor.

01:06:22.245 --> 01:06:24.646
Yeah, we need to teach
some fat fuck a lesson.

01:06:27.117 --> 01:06:29.284
Yeah, the high school,
goes down at three o'clock

01:06:29.286 --> 01:06:30.485
by the entrance.

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:33.321
Miles said it will be
worth your while.

01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:43.231
[bell rings]

01:06:57.748 --> 01:06:59.647
What was all that
about with Miles earlier?

01:07:00.751 --> 01:07:02.317
Miles is just a dick.

01:07:03.253 --> 01:07:04.619
No, I wanna know now.

01:07:04.621 --> 01:07:06.588
Is this about you
training at Manny's?

01:07:07.524 --> 01:07:09.090
[Jimmy sighs]

01:07:09.092 --> 01:07:12.227
Look, basically,
Miles tried conning me

01:07:12.229 --> 01:07:13.695
into giving him
two hundred bucks.

01:07:14.598 --> 01:07:16.364
But if he knew
I was good for it,

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:18.366
he'd just
keep coming back for more.

01:07:19.803 --> 01:07:22.237
Action took me to Manny's
to learn self-defense.

01:07:22.239 --> 01:07:24.406
I didn't go there
to lose weight.

01:07:24.408 --> 01:07:27.442
I'm just tired
of being pushed around.

01:07:27.444 --> 01:07:28.994
[scoffs]

01:07:28.995 --> 01:07:30.545
Only person I told this to
was Andy,

01:07:30.547 --> 01:07:32.547
but somehow Vinny knows.

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:34.182
Wait, Vinny knows?

01:07:34.184 --> 01:07:35.583
That means that word
is getting around.

01:07:35.585 --> 01:07:37.485
Don't you think if Vinny knows,
then Miles knows?

01:07:37.487 --> 01:07:38.520
[scoffs]

01:07:38.522 --> 01:07:39.421
Don't worry about it.

01:07:39.423 --> 01:07:40.321
I'll be fine.

01:07:40.323 --> 01:07:42.590
[bell rings]

01:07:42.592 --> 01:07:44.125
I'll see you later.

[Manny] <i> Hello?</i>

01:08:00.444 --> 01:08:02.243
Hi, can I speak to Manny,
please?

01:08:02.245 --> 01:08:03.578
[Manny] <i> This is he.</i>

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.747
Hi Manny, it's um-- It's Adrian,

01:08:05.749 --> 01:08:08.216
Jimmy's friend...

01:08:08.218 --> 01:08:09.818
girlfriend.

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:12.654
Um, anyway, I--
I don't mean to bother you,

01:08:12.656 --> 01:08:14.189
<i> but I just--</i>
<i> I don't know what to do.</i>

01:08:14.191 --> 01:08:15.523
Can't bother me.

01:08:15.525 --> 01:08:17.091
Is everything all right?

01:08:17.094 --> 01:08:18.859
So, Jimmy's meeting
that kid Miles

01:08:18.862 --> 01:08:20.462
after school today
to give him his money,

01:08:20.464 --> 01:08:21.796
but Jimmy doesn't have
any money,

01:08:21.798 --> 01:08:23.198
<i> and I know what that means.</i>

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.765
But I don't know if Miles knows

01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:26.768
that Jimmy's been taking
boxing lessons with you,

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:28.703
but I don't know
if Jimmy knows that Miles knows.

01:08:28.705 --> 01:08:30.104
Do you understand?

01:08:30.107 --> 01:08:30.988
[Manny sighs]

01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:31.872
<i> Yes, of course I understand.</i>

01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:33.408
But really there's nothing

01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:34.542
we can do about it.

01:08:34.544 --> 01:08:36.328
We can't be there

01:08:36.328 --> 01:08:38.113
to hold Jimmy's hand
every scrap he get in.

01:08:38.115 --> 01:08:40.682
<i> And besides,</i>
<i> Action seems to think</i>

01:08:40.684 --> 01:08:43.251
that Jimmy can hold his own
with this Miles kid.

01:08:43.252 --> 01:08:45.487
I know, but I don't trust Miles.

01:08:45.488 --> 01:08:46.854
He's a snake in the grass.
I just--

01:08:46.857 --> 01:08:48.523
I think he's up to something.

01:08:48.524 --> 01:08:49.524
[sighs]

01:08:49.526 --> 01:08:50.625
Does Jimmy have friends?

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:52.193
[Adrian] <i> Yeah, but--</i>

01:08:52.194 --> 01:08:53.862
Well, that's
what friends are for,

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:56.231
<i> to watch your back.</i>

01:08:56.233 --> 01:08:57.398
Okay.

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:59.634
I'm sure he'll be fine, dear.

01:09:00.504 --> 01:09:01.569
I hope so.

Can you be here
around three o'clock?

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:19.254

Yeah.

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:58.560
[Jimmy] No.

01:09:58.562 --> 01:10:00.595
Of course, not.

01:10:00.597 --> 01:10:01.663
because you lied to me.

[rock music plays]

01:10:07.404 --> 01:10:08.870
You thought you could, uh,

01:10:08.872 --> 01:10:10.872
you could show up
and then surprise me

01:10:10.874 --> 01:10:13.374
with your fancy
new boxing skills.

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:15.443
Well, I got a surprise too.

01:10:15.445 --> 01:10:17.812
You see, the money you owe me,

01:10:17.814 --> 01:10:20.582
well, I passed that along
to a friend of mine.

in Jersey State prison.

time to say bye-bye.

the money back to him

or, well, I'm pretty sure

01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:35.697
you can figure out
what happens if you don't.

Oh, man!

01:14:00.804 --> 01:14:02.703
I remember
when you thought going viral

01:14:02.705 --> 01:14:04.439
meant a trip to the free clinic.

What are you doing now?
Eating pizza?

I can't eat? I gotta it.

01:14:39.625 --> 01:14:41.242
But you're eating all afternoon.
Now you're eating pizza?

01:14:41.244 --> 01:14:43.644
-This is dinner. That was lunch.
-Doesn't your wife cook for you?

01:14:43.646 --> 01:14:46.247
Yes, she cooks.
Don't worry about it.

01:14:46.249 --> 01:14:47.882
I gave her a break tonight.

-Yeah, I gave her a break.

What don't you give me
a fucking break?

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:53.688
-I'd give you a break.
-Yeah. Well, anyway, you know.

01:14:53.690 --> 01:14:56.057
Hey, tell him, fucking no carbs.

01:14:56.059 --> 01:14:57.459
How many fucking carbs

01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:58.860
are in this slice
of fucking pizza over here?

01:14:58.862 --> 01:15:01.629
-Hey, pizza is natural.
-Natural?

01:15:01.631 --> 01:15:03.598
-Yeah, it's natural.
-My fucking hair is natural.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.899
Yeah,
his hair is fucking natural.

01:15:04.901 --> 01:15:06.868
Right, right, right, right.
