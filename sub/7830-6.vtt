00:33.867 --> 00:36.411
Marge, can't we
get some clear plates?

00:36.494 --> 00:39.497
I can't see the TV.

00:39.581 --> 00:42.375
Is it really necessary
to watch TV while we're eating?

00:42.459 --> 00:44.294
We're getting food all over.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.019
Yoink!

01:02.312 --> 01:03.688
If you really wanted us
to be neater

01:03.772 --> 01:05.648
you'd serve us
out of one long bowl.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.234
You're talking
about a trough.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.612
We're not going
to eat from a trough.

01:10.695 --> 01:12.989
And another thing,
it's only 5:15.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.824
Why are you
in your underwear?

01:14.908 --> 01:16.493
Hey, this ain't
the Ritz.

01:16.576 --> 01:21.498
At least let's have a civilized
conversation, shall we?

01:21.581 --> 01:23.249
Lisa, how was school?

01:23.333 --> 01:24.292
How was what?
What?

01:24.375 --> 01:25.502
School! School!

01:25.585 --> 01:27.504
It's not time
for school.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.839
I know it's not--
(groans)

01:29.923 --> 01:31.925
I'm going into
the dining room

01:32.008 --> 01:33.510
to have a conversation.

01:33.593 --> 01:36.638
Anyone who wants
to join me is welcome.

01:36.721 --> 01:40.892
MARGE: Hello, Marge,
how's the family?

01:40.975 --> 01:42.227
I don't want
to talk about it.

01:42.310 --> 01:43.478
Mind your own business.

01:43.561 --> 01:45.063
Keep it down in there,
everybody.

01:45.146 --> 01:48.691
Homer, is this the way
you pictured married life?

01:48.775 --> 01:50.401
Yeah, pretty much.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.946
Except we drove around in
a van solving mysteries.

01:53.029 --> 01:54.906
Well, I pictured
cocktail parties

01:54.989 --> 01:56.241
and candlelit dinners.

01:56.324 --> 01:57.617
I pictured napkins!

01:57.700 --> 01:59.994
Homer, I want to throw
a dinner party.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.080
Oh, I hate
having parties.

02:02.163 --> 02:03.957
The toilet
always gets backed up.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.126
I don't care
if the sink shoots sludge.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.585
We're having a party.

02:13.133 --> 02:17.178
Man, that is flagrant
false advertising!

02:20.640 --> 02:23.977
It's just not a dinner party
without a melon baller

02:24.060 --> 02:25.979
and we'll need a citrus zester

02:26.062 --> 02:27.313
a ravioli crimper.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.858
Ooh, an oyster mallet.

02:29.941 --> 02:32.277
"Made in U.S.A."

02:32.360 --> 02:34.946
Oh, no, thank you.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.865
Hey, Lis,
check this out.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.449
Nonstick coating.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.873
Ooh.

02:44.956 --> 02:48.501
A punchbowl like that
just screams good taste.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.420
Wouldn't it be perfect
for the dinner party?

02:50.503 --> 02:51.754
Oh, we can't afford that.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.798
Who do you think
I am, Liz Taylor?

02:53.882 --> 02:56.593
Well, maybe we could
use it once

02:56.676 --> 02:58.094
and then return it.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.721
Marge, we're not
talking

02:59.804 --> 03:01.723
about a toothbrush here.

03:04.767 --> 03:06.603
Bart, company's coming.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.730
Go put doilies under the coasters.
Hurry! Hurry!

03:08.813 --> 03:09.689
(bell rings)

03:12.692 --> 03:14.777
Lisa, quick,
screw these back on.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.112
Mom, calm down.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.864
The party's not for
another three hours.

03:17.947 --> 03:18.865
Oh, good.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.283
That will give me time

03:20.366 --> 03:22.493
to add another coat
of glaze to the ham.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.336
(grunts)

03:42.263 --> 03:43.181
Homer!

03:43.264 --> 03:44.432
HOMER:
What?!

03:44.515 --> 03:45.558
Are you ready?!

03:45.642 --> 03:47.894
Just got to put my shoes on.

03:47.977 --> 03:50.021
The only thing I asked
you to do for this party

03:50.104 --> 03:51.940
was put on clothes
and you didn't do it.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.066
(doorbell rings)

03:53.149 --> 03:54.400
And now it's too late!

03:54.484 --> 03:55.902
They're here!

03:55.985 --> 03:58.363
Bart, greet our guests
and take their coats.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.618
Mom, Reverend Lovejoy
doesn't have a coat.

04:03.701 --> 04:04.619
Should I let him in?

04:04.702 --> 04:05.995
My coat was stolen

04:06.079 --> 04:08.206
at last week's
interfaith banquet

04:08.289 --> 04:09.415
so I helped myself

04:09.499 --> 04:11.376
to a few
of the better umbrellas.

04:11.459 --> 04:12.669
Well, as you can see

04:12.752 --> 04:14.837
we don't believe
fur is murder.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.965
But paying for
it sure is.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.675
(laughing)

04:18.758 --> 04:20.218
Uh, sorry we're late

04:20.301 --> 04:22.637
but Luann had to
put on her face.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.722
She doesn't want
anyone to know

04:24.806 --> 04:25.807
she's got no eyebrows.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.642
What? You don't.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.106
(all conversing)

04:33.189 --> 04:35.984
Did anyone see that
new Woodsy Allen movie?

04:36.067 --> 04:37.819
You know, I'd like
his films except for

04:37.902 --> 04:39.445
that nervous fellow
who's always in them.

04:39.529 --> 04:42.240
If you want to talk nervous,
you should have seen Kirk deal

04:42.323 --> 04:44.617
with the high school boys
who egged our Bonneville.

04:44.701 --> 04:47.245
I should've asked them
to hurl some bacon.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.622
Then maybe I could've had
a decent breakfast for once.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.670
HOMER: You know what
you two need?

04:55.753 --> 04:58.756
A little comic strip
called "Love Is".

04:58.840 --> 05:02.218
It's about two naked eight-year-olds
who are married.

05:05.805 --> 05:08.016
Hmm, well...

05:08.099 --> 05:09.851
Marge, if that was
my last meal

05:09.934 --> 05:13.438
I'd tell the warden, "Bring on
the lethal injection".

05:13.521 --> 05:15.815
Yeah, Marge, I know
I haven't eaten that well

05:15.898 --> 05:17.525
since I was in the army.

05:17.608 --> 05:18.860
Or that noisily.

05:18.943 --> 05:20.653
All right, that's it.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.572
So, who wants
to play a game?

05:22.655 --> 05:23.531
Hmm, hmm, hmm?

05:25.074 --> 05:28.911
Oh... That's a
noodle scratcher.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.496
(gasps):
Cornstarch!

05:30.580 --> 05:31.956
Oh, righty-oh!

05:32.040 --> 05:35.835
It's good for keeping
down the urges.

05:35.918 --> 05:39.505
Oh, come on, Luann.
You know what this is.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.758
Kirk, I don't know
what it is.

05:41.841 --> 05:45.720
Ah, it could not be
more simple, Luann.

05:45.803 --> 05:47.180
Do you want me to show
this to the cat

05:47.263 --> 05:49.057
and have the cat
tell you what it is?

05:49.140 --> 05:50.516
'Cause the cat's
going to get it.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.061
I'm sorry I'm not
as smart as you, Kirk.

05:53.144 --> 05:55.521
We didn't all
go to Gudger college.

05:55.605 --> 05:56.939
It's "Dignity!" Gahh!

05:57.023 --> 06:00.276
Don't you even know
dignity when you see it?

06:00.360 --> 06:01.277
Kirk, you're spitting.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.278
Okay, genius,

06:02.362 --> 06:04.030
why don't you draw dignity?

06:10.953 --> 06:12.080
-(all exclaiming)
-Oh, that's dignity all right.

06:12.163 --> 06:15.291
Worthy of Webster's.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.335
It's no wonder
I can't draw dignity.

06:17.418 --> 06:19.170
I gave it up
when I married her.

06:19.253 --> 06:21.506
Now, Kirk,
it's only a game.

06:21.589 --> 06:22.965
Sometimes, we--

06:23.049 --> 06:24.384
Aw, cram it, churchy!

06:24.467 --> 06:27.345
Maybe we should all have
a few drinks.

06:27.428 --> 06:28.471
I'd have a drink,

06:28.554 --> 06:29.889
but it might
loosen my tongue.

06:29.972 --> 06:32.475
You want to talk?
Go ahead, Luann, talk.

06:32.558 --> 06:33.976
Why don't you
tell them

06:34.060 --> 06:35.395
one of your little
bedtime stories, huh?

06:35.478 --> 06:37.230
Like the one about
how rotten it is

06:37.313 --> 06:38.773
to be married
to a loser.

06:38.856 --> 06:40.441
Or how about
the one about

06:40.525 --> 06:42.777
how I carry a change purse?

06:42.860 --> 06:44.195
Yeah, a purse!

06:44.278 --> 06:45.571
Shut up and let the woman talk.

06:45.655 --> 06:48.116
Okay, Kirk,
I'll tell a story.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.659
It's about a man
whose father-in-law

06:49.742 --> 06:52.328
gave him a sweet job as
manager of a cracker factory.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.329
HOMER:
Boring.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.956
A man whose complete lack

06:55.039 --> 06:56.999
of business sense
and managerial impotence...

06:57.083 --> 06:58.543
Ooh, here we go.

06:58.626 --> 07:00.962
...sent the number-one
cracker factory in town

07:01.045 --> 07:04.006
into a tie for sixth with
Tabletime and Allied Biscuit.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.134
KIRK: You want to hear
a secret, everybody?

07:06.217 --> 07:07.969
Luann loves it--
Loves it--

07:08.052 --> 07:09.720
When I fail.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.390
Oh, yes, Kirk, I love having to
borrow money from my sister.

07:12.473 --> 07:15.810
I love having to steal clothes
from the church donation box.

07:15.893 --> 07:17.728
Oh, sweet Jesus.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.774
Lisa, why don't you
come sing for us?

07:21.858 --> 07:23.151
<i>♪ You're a grand old flag... ♪</i>

07:23.234 --> 07:25.194
Oh, great.
You got the kid singing.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.821
I hope you're happy now.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.156
I am not happy

07:28.239 --> 07:30.992
and I haven't been happy
for a long time.

07:31.075 --> 07:32.410
I want a divorce!

07:32.493 --> 07:33.744
(all gasping)

07:36.080 --> 07:38.833
A... divorce?

07:39.959 --> 07:41.836
Sure. Divorce.

07:41.919 --> 07:43.921
Hey, you got it,
toots

07:44.005 --> 07:47.592
and here's a picture
even you can figure out.

07:47.675 --> 07:50.136
It's a door! Use it!

07:50.219 --> 07:51.554
That's a door?

07:54.015 --> 07:56.392
Hello, I'm Doctor Hibbert.

07:56.476 --> 08:00.480
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to amputate your butt.

08:00.563 --> 08:01.856
(all laughing)

08:01.939 --> 08:04.442
All right,
if you think you must.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.819
Come on, Milhouse,
we are going.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.738
Aw, can't I come home later?

08:08.821 --> 08:10.072
There's not going to be
a home later.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.491
Oh, okay.

08:11.574 --> 08:15.453
Ta-ta, I'm off
to the beauty salon.

08:15.536 --> 08:16.496
Good night.

08:16.579 --> 08:17.872
Thanks for coming.

08:17.955 --> 08:19.123
We'll see you.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.458
Bye-bye.

08:20.541 --> 08:22.835
Well, I think that
went pretty well.

08:24.420 --> 08:25.880
(tires squealing)

08:28.674 --> 08:30.051
What?

08:33.429 --> 08:35.598
I feel terrible.

08:35.681 --> 08:38.476
The Van Houtens
split up at our party.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.644
Marge, please.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.562
That was 20 minutes ago.

08:41.646 --> 08:42.855
I shouldn't have served

08:42.939 --> 08:44.690
those North Korean
fortune cookies.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.318
They were so insulting:
"You are a coward."

08:47.401 --> 08:49.904
No one likes to hear that
after a nice meal.

08:49.987 --> 08:51.989
You can't keep
blaming yourself.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.784
Just blame yourself
once and move on.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.161
You know who the real
victim is in all of this--

08:57.245 --> 08:58.412
Milhouse.

09:01.499 --> 09:05.336
Hey, Van Houten,
I heard your folks broke up.

09:05.419 --> 09:08.214
Aren't you going
to say, "Ha-ha"?

09:08.297 --> 09:09.840
Oh, by no means.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.342
My dad left my mom

09:11.425 --> 09:14.262
after she got hooked
on cough drops.

09:14.345 --> 09:17.139
By the end,
her breath was so fresh...

09:17.223 --> 09:19.850
she wasn't really
my mother anymore.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.018
Oh.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.521
So I guess
I'm not alone.

09:23.604 --> 09:25.106
Ah, you'll do fine.

09:25.189 --> 09:27.316
My divorce was tough on my kid

09:27.400 --> 09:28.401
but he got over it.

09:28.484 --> 09:30.528
I sleep in a drawer.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.752
I must say, Luann,
you're really

09:46.836 --> 09:50.214
handling this
splendidly.

09:50.298 --> 09:53.259
From now on, forget everything
you thought you knew

09:53.342 --> 09:55.511
about Luann Van Houten.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.762
Actually, Luann,
I don't really

09:56.846 --> 09:57.888
know anything
about you.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.640
Forget it.
She's gone.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.392
Presto-chango!

10:01.475 --> 10:02.602
Kaboom!

Sweet Fanny Adams!

10:04.395 --> 10:05.438

Singles life
is great, homer.

10:09.483 --> 10:11.402
I can do whatever I want.

10:11.485 --> 10:13.779
Today I drank a beer
in the bathroom.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.197
The one down the hall.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.325
Yeah. And another great thing:

10:17.408 --> 10:18.743
you get your own bed.

10:18.826 --> 10:21.579
I sleep in a racing car.
Do you?

10:21.662 --> 10:23.748
I sleep in a big bed
with my wife.

10:23.831 --> 10:25.750
Oh. Yeah.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.543
(knocking)

10:29.670 --> 10:31.005
Hey, there, Kirk.

10:31.088 --> 10:32.923
Oh, boy, what's going on?

10:33.007 --> 10:34.258
Patio party?

10:34.342 --> 10:36.010
No. A possum drowned
in the pool.

10:36.093 --> 10:37.678
You have any garbage bags?

10:37.762 --> 10:39.847
Uh, just throw it
over the fence.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.182
Let Arby's worry about it.

10:41.265 --> 10:42.808
That's Jerry.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.353
He's a major player
down at the sewing store.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.313
Well, thanks
for introducing me.

10:47.396 --> 10:48.439
Oh, don't worry, Homer.

10:48.522 --> 10:49.857
You know me

10:49.940 --> 10:52.985
and I'm a superstar
at the cracker factory.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.488
KIRK: You're letting me go?!

10:55.571 --> 10:58.115
Kirk, crackers
are a family food.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.659
Happy families.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.703
Maybe single people
eat crackers; we don't know.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.997
Frankly, we don't
want to know.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.457
It's a market
we could do without.

11:06.540 --> 11:07.917
So that's it--
After 20 years

11:08.000 --> 11:09.251
so long, good luck?

11:09.335 --> 11:10.670
I don't recall
saying good luck.

11:10.753 --> 11:13.839
(imitating car engine)

11:13.923 --> 11:17.593
And the winner
of the Milhouse 500 is...

11:17.677 --> 11:20.346
Milhouse!

11:20.429 --> 11:21.681
LUANN:
Milhouse, are you sure

11:21.764 --> 11:23.599
you want
to drive that inside?

11:23.683 --> 11:24.850
Yes.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.769
Okay. Be careful,
sweet, sweet treasure.

11:26.852 --> 11:27.728
(doorbell rings)

11:30.064 --> 11:31.774
God, I missed you, Lu-Lu.

11:31.857 --> 11:32.775
(giggles)

11:32.858 --> 11:34.193
Chase...

11:34.276 --> 11:36.612
It's only been three hours.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.863
Who's Chase?

11:37.947 --> 11:39.907
Oh. That's mom's
new boyfriend.

11:39.990 --> 11:42.827
Hey, I know you
from American Gladiators.

11:42.910 --> 11:44.120
You're Pyro!

11:44.203 --> 11:45.788
Only on weekends.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.331
During the week

11:47.415 --> 11:49.125
I'm just your average
work-a-day stuntman.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.167
Really?

11:50.251 --> 11:52.503
Go ahead.
Break a chair on me.

11:52.586 --> 11:53.796
(grunts)

11:53.879 --> 11:55.840
Wow! Thanks.

11:55.923 --> 11:57.675
Okay, boys,
I got to go.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.468
Come on, Lu-Lu,
let's roll.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.814
(whistling)

12:11.897 --> 12:13.524
(yelling)

12:13.607 --> 12:15.818
Ow! Gee. Ow!

12:15.901 --> 12:17.695
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

12:17.778 --> 12:19.697
Geez, sor-ry.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.699
It's a pretty standard
stunt, Homer.

12:21.782 --> 12:23.576
MARGE:
Homer, get ready!

12:23.659 --> 12:24.702
For what?

12:24.785 --> 12:26.495
Remember?
Luann and Chase

12:26.579 --> 12:28.914
are taking us out
to hear Spalding Gray.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.833
I don't want to go to that.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.043
You said you'd do it
as a favor to me.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.880
That doesn't sound
like something I'd say.

12:35.963 --> 12:37.131
Fine. I'll go
without you.

12:37.214 --> 12:38.758
Okay. Love ya.

12:43.262 --> 12:46.766
Homer, I want you to meet
my new special lady.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.059
Say hello to Starla.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.770
(cigarette sizzling)

12:50.853 --> 12:53.522
Can I have the keys
to the car, lover?

12:53.606 --> 12:55.858
I feel like
changing wigs.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.486
Okay.

12:58.569 --> 13:02.281
Starla's a temp
at K-ZOG radio 530.

13:02.364 --> 13:04.700
She's going to help me
launch my singing career.

13:04.784 --> 13:05.868
(engine racing
and tires screeching)

13:05.951 --> 13:06.827
My car!

13:10.164 --> 13:12.750
Oh, my demo tape!

13:15.795 --> 13:17.338
"Can I Borrow a Feeling?"

13:17.421 --> 13:19.340
(laughing)

13:19.423 --> 13:22.384
"Can I Borrow a Feeling?"

13:22.468 --> 13:26.222
That's your picture
on the front.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.973
Go ahead, Homer,
laugh at me.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.391
I already did.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.976
(sighs)

13:31.060 --> 13:32.478
You know why
all this happened, don't you?

13:32.561 --> 13:34.772
'Cause I took
my marriage for granted.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.357
You know, in 12 years

13:36.440 --> 13:38.567
I never once helped out
with the housework?

13:38.651 --> 13:40.319
Oh, yeah,
you got to do that.

13:40.402 --> 13:42.363
I could've at least
stayed in shape for her.

13:42.446 --> 13:43.781
Oh, and for yourself.

13:43.864 --> 13:45.491
I could've taken
just a little time

13:45.574 --> 13:47.660
to make her feel special.

13:47.743 --> 13:49.995
It can't just be sex.
It can't.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.248
God, I was so self-centered.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.999
No wonder
I didn't see it coming.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.876
That's how it is, though.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.420
One day your wife is
making you your favorite meal

13:58.504 --> 14:00.756
the next day
you're thawing a hot dog

14:00.840 --> 14:02.550
in a gas station sink.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.844
Oh, that's tough, pal.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.804
But it's never going
to happen to me.

14:06.887 --> 14:08.264
Well, how do you know?

14:08.347 --> 14:10.474
What makes you guys so special?

14:10.558 --> 14:12.101
'Cause Marge and I
have one thing

14:12.184 --> 14:13.853
that can never be broken:

14:13.936 --> 14:19.024
A strong marriage built on
a solid foundation of routine.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.901
Marge, I'm home.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.069
Where are you?

14:22.152 --> 14:24.029
Are you okay?

14:24.113 --> 14:25.656
I don't smell dinner.

14:25.739 --> 14:28.117
"Dear Homer..."
Aw.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.911
"Sorry you didn't want
to join me tonight.

14:30.995 --> 14:33.038
"I left you hot dogs
for dinner.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.790
They're thawing in the sink."

14:38.127 --> 14:39.211
(screams)

14:46.093 --> 14:47.678
Hi, Dad.

14:47.761 --> 14:49.638
You know, there's
buns in the cabinet.

14:49.722 --> 14:50.890
Lisa, wait.

14:50.973 --> 14:52.474
I know you're only
eight years old

14:52.558 --> 14:54.351
and I don't want to put
a lot of pressure on you

14:54.435 --> 14:56.478
but you've got
to save my marriage.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.899
Oh. Okay.
Can I stay up?

14:59.982 --> 15:01.400
Mmm... all right.

15:03.402 --> 15:04.361
(clearing throat)

15:04.445 --> 15:05.696
As you know,
there's been

15:05.779 --> 15:07.573
a lot of talk
about divorce lately

15:07.656 --> 15:10.284
and I think your mom
might not be happy with me.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.161
You've done a lot of crazy stuff
over the years

15:12.244 --> 15:13.329
and she stood by you.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.122
Why would she
leave you now?

15:15.205 --> 15:17.666
'Cause there's lots of stuff
she doesn't know about.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.752
You mean, like your poker shack
out in the swamp?

15:19.835 --> 15:20.753
Mm-hmm.

15:20.836 --> 15:21.879
She knows.

15:21.962 --> 15:23.380
Oh, I knew this would happen.

15:23.464 --> 15:26.342
Our whole marriage started off
on the wrong foot.

15:28.218 --> 15:29.511
MAN:
Dearly beloved, we are gathered

15:29.595 --> 15:31.764
in the sight of God
and this casino to join...

15:31.847 --> 15:32.765
Homer.

15:32.848 --> 15:34.516
-And...
-Marge.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.101
In holy matrimony.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.395
By the power vested in me
by the state gaming commission

15:38.479 --> 15:40.356
I pronounce you
man and wife.

15:40.439 --> 15:41.607
Here's ten dollars
worth of chips.

15:41.690 --> 15:43.359
You may kiss the bride.

15:43.442 --> 15:44.318
Mm...

15:50.366 --> 15:51.575
See?

15:51.659 --> 15:53.410
You don't have to spend
a lot of money

15:53.494 --> 15:55.579
to have a first-class
wedding reception.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.831
(Marge sighing)

15:57.915 --> 15:59.959
It's getting less
and less likely

16:00.042 --> 16:02.211
you're going
to yell "Surprise"

16:02.294 --> 16:04.129
and have all my
friends jump out.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.631
"Levi's."

16:05.714 --> 16:08.050
Hey, you think that truck
is full of jeans?

16:11.637 --> 16:13.555
You're very lucky
to have mom.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.520
That's your advice?
Go to bed.

16:23.899 --> 16:25.442
Good morning.

16:25.526 --> 16:26.819
You know, Marge,
I was thinking

16:26.902 --> 16:29.571
about how much I enjoy
your interests

16:29.655 --> 16:30.948
so I wandered over

16:31.031 --> 16:33.200
to that theater
you went to last night

16:33.283 --> 16:36.161
and I bought tickets
to their entire season.

16:36.245 --> 16:39.456
Look, Mostly Madrigal.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.834
Hey, that might be good.

16:41.917 --> 16:45.004
Oh, oh, An Evening
with Philip Glass.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.463
Just an evening?

16:46.547 --> 16:51.510
Voices of
the Elderly Poor. Hmm...

16:51.593 --> 16:55.222
Homey, I appreciate this

16:55.305 --> 16:57.850
but I'd really like
to get some sleep.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.393
Oh, of course, my sweet.

16:59.476 --> 17:02.062
I'll just make some
soothing ocean sounds for you.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.605
(blowing)

17:06.984 --> 17:11.488
(imitates fog horn)

17:11.572 --> 17:13.615
(squawking)

17:13.699 --> 17:15.034
(inhales)

17:15.117 --> 17:16.785
Arr, matey.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.628
(humming)

17:26.712 --> 17:29.465
Armando, don't you think
you're taking a lot off--

17:29.548 --> 17:30.507
(screams)

17:30.591 --> 17:32.342
Homer, what are you doing?

17:32.426 --> 17:35.804
I wanted to surprise you
with a kicky summer do.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.723
How many husbands would
do that for their wives?

17:37.806 --> 17:40.059
None-- They'd have
more sense than that.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.311
Ooh... you're feisty.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.396
I'm going to give
you a Madonna cut.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.773
Mmm! Homer

17:45.856 --> 17:48.525
I don't need you around me
24 hours a day.

17:48.609 --> 17:49.526
I'm a grown woman.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.445
I can take care of myself.

17:51.528 --> 17:54.031
Now will you please
just go away?

17:56.158 --> 17:59.703
Oh... I just
made things worse.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.997
A few clumsy gestures
aren't going to make up

18:02.081 --> 18:03.582
for ten years of neglect.

18:03.665 --> 18:07.628
Marge deserves someone
who will treat her right.

18:07.711 --> 18:10.047
Marge deserves a fresh start.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.595
I'd like to file for...

18:16.678 --> 18:18.055
divorce.

18:20.557 --> 18:23.060
These things happen.
Eight dollars.

18:23.143 --> 18:25.687
Only three cavities, Bart.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.397
Your best checkup ever.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.399
I'm going to make
you my specialty--

18:29.483 --> 18:30.567
Butterscotch chicken.

18:30.651 --> 18:31.777
HOMER:
Marge?

18:31.860 --> 18:33.529
Can you
come in here?

18:33.612 --> 18:35.531
We need to talk.

18:42.037 --> 18:43.664
ALL: Surprise!

18:43.747 --> 18:44.665
(gasping)

18:46.792 --> 18:47.668
Surprise.

18:49.878 --> 18:52.131
Marge, will you
marry me?

18:52.214 --> 18:54.174
Why, am I pregnant?

18:54.258 --> 18:55.342
No.

18:55.425 --> 18:57.678
It's a second wedding, honey.

18:57.761 --> 19:00.639
Our first one was so crummy,
I had to make it up to you.

19:00.722 --> 19:02.724
I really love you.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.601
Oh, Homey.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.103
I know you love me.

19:06.186 --> 19:07.896
We don't need
to get married again.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.189
Yes, we do.

19:09.273 --> 19:11.150
I got us a divorce
this afternoon.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.609
What?!

19:12.693 --> 19:14.570
I didn't want
a hokey second wedding

19:14.653 --> 19:16.446
like those ones on TV.

19:16.530 --> 19:17.739
This one is for real.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.616
I want our marriage
to be perfect

19:19.700 --> 19:20.909
right from the start

19:20.993 --> 19:23.287
so we don't end up
like Kirk and Luann.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.122
We never will.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.001
Dearly beloved--

19:29.084 --> 19:30.502
Wait.

19:30.586 --> 19:33.172
I want one last chance
to enjoy single life.

19:34.464 --> 19:35.632
(belches)

19:35.716 --> 19:36.633
Okay, ready.

19:36.717 --> 19:37.634
I will now

19:37.718 --> 19:39.636
read these special vows

19:39.720 --> 19:43.098
which Homer has prepared
for this occasion.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.850
"Do you, Marge, take Homer

19:44.933 --> 19:48.770
in richness and in poorness,"
"Poorness" is underlined--

19:48.854 --> 19:52.024
"In impotence and in potence

19:52.107 --> 19:53.650
"In quiet solitude

19:53.734 --> 19:56.403
