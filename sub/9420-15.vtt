06:22.449 --> 06:25.183
Still giving this guy your--

06:25.185 --> 06:26.318
Your time and your love?

06:26.320 --> 06:28.086
>> it's just hard

06:28.088 --> 06:30.122
To get rid of it and just act

06:30.124 --> 06:30.922
Like it never happened.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.157
I can't just lock it up

06:32.159 --> 06:33.091
In a cage.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.494
I want it.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.161
>> al right.

06:36.163 --> 06:36.895
Well, i'm so curious.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.363
Do you--what photos do you have

06:38.365 --> 06:40.399
Of this person?

06:40.401 --> 06:41.333
All right, so these--this is

06:41.335 --> 06:42.734
A picture of when he first

06:42.736 --> 06:44.503
Sent you pictures in an email.

06:44.505 --> 06:45.170
>> mm-hmm.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.171
>> and i can see why you

06:46.173 --> 06:47.072
Thought, like,

06:47.074 --> 06:48.640
"this is a really cute guy.

06:48.642 --> 06:49.775
I'm into him."

06:49.777 --> 06:51.009
Then?

06:51.011 --> 06:51.676
>> i told him,

06:51.678 --> 06:53.145
"i'm gonna put you on <i> catfish,"</i>

06:53.147 --> 06:54.413
And then he said,

06:54.415 --> 06:55.313
"you want to skype, or you

06:55.315 --> 06:56.415
Want me to send pictures?"

06:56.417 --> 06:58.483
He was like, "i'm geo.

06:58.485 --> 06:59.584
I'm a female.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.120
I'm sorry that i hurt you."

07:02.122 --> 07:03.455
>> what?

07:03.457 --> 07:05.323
He texted you, and it was these?

07:05.325 --> 07:06.491
Okay, so it was this one...

07:06.493 --> 07:07.159
>> yeah.

07:07.161 --> 07:08.493
>> which is...

07:08.495 --> 07:09.161
>> wow.

07:09.163 --> 07:10.328
>> pretty clearly a woman

07:10.330 --> 07:11.863
Smoking, and then

07:11.865 --> 07:14.366
This weird photo.

07:14.368 --> 07:16.635
>> that's really disturbing.

07:16.637 --> 07:17.302
>> it looks like

07:17.304 --> 07:18.003
The same person.

07:18.005 --> 07:18.670
>> yeah.

07:18.672 --> 07:19.371
>> i said, "if you gonna

07:19.373 --> 07:20.071
Send me pictures, i want

07:20.073 --> 07:20.772
You to send me a picture

07:20.774 --> 07:22.808
With my name on it."

07:22.810 --> 07:24.843
>> so david sent you this,

07:24.845 --> 07:27.879
Saying, "sorry, andria."

07:27.881 --> 07:29.247
What's this?

07:29.249 --> 07:29.915
>> he just randomly

07:29.917 --> 07:30.715
Sent me that.

07:30.717 --> 07:31.950
>> so randomly, you also got

07:31.952 --> 07:32.751
A picture of an

07:32.753 --> 07:34.386
Illinois driver's license...

07:34.388 --> 07:35.053
>> wow.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.521
>> of the girl.

07:36.523 --> 07:39.391
So this seems pretty legit.

07:39.393 --> 07:40.692
>> and with a name

07:40.694 --> 07:41.359
And an address.

07:41.361 --> 07:42.360
>> christina [bleep].

07:42.362 --> 07:43.361
>> and the letters he sent

07:43.363 --> 07:44.696
Me has that address on there,

07:44.698 --> 07:45.664
But that's supposedly

07:45.666 --> 07:46.698
His mom's address.

07:46.700 --> 07:47.365
>> date of birth--

07:47.367 --> 07:48.733
>> wait. He sent you letters?

07:48.735 --> 07:49.568
>> mm-hmm.

07:49.570 --> 07:50.402
>> what did it say?

07:50.404 --> 07:51.470
>> it's over there, actually,

07:51.472 --> 07:52.170
If you want to read it.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.004
>> yeah, i want to see it.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.139
>> okay.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.308
>> whoa.

07:56.310 --> 07:57.242
"what's up?

07:57.244 --> 07:58.243
I miss you like crazy.

07:58.245 --> 07:59.911
I haven't heard you tell me

07:59.913 --> 08:01.613
You love me in so long

08:01.615 --> 08:02.414
Or that you missed me.

08:02.416 --> 08:03.882
I haven't felt it, neither.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.417
I just want to be wanted

08:05.419 --> 08:06.718
Or loved, and i hate

08:06.720 --> 08:08.053
How you take that away.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.888
Just got to be the best man

08:09.890 --> 08:11.022
That i can be for you,

08:11.024 --> 08:12.557
But i'm being real."

08:12.559 --> 08:14.359
Wow, that's, like, a--i mean,

08:14.361 --> 08:17.062
A really passionate love letter.

08:17.064 --> 08:17.896
What did you think

08:17.898 --> 08:19.030
When you read that?

08:19.032 --> 08:20.065
>> to be honest, i was kind of

08:20.067 --> 08:22.300
Surprised that he even sent it.

08:22.302 --> 08:23.168
>> this is--oh,

08:23.170 --> 08:23.935
Is there something in here?

08:23.937 --> 08:24.803
>> yeah, it's the same thing.

08:24.805 --> 08:25.837
>> oh, "i love you, baby.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.072
I wish i was next to you,

08:27.074 --> 08:29.441
On top of you, [bleep] of you."

08:29.443 --> 08:30.642
Oh, wow.

08:30.644 --> 08:31.309
>> what is that?

08:31.311 --> 08:32.878
>> just--is that an outline of--

08:32.880 --> 08:34.179
>> it's hard to even--

08:34.181 --> 08:35.514
>> did he just lay it down

08:35.515 --> 08:36.181
On a table

08:36.183 --> 08:37.048
And, like, trace it?

08:37.049 --> 08:37.716
Is that what that is?

08:37.717 --> 08:38.683
>> that looks like

08:38.684 --> 08:39.717
What that's supposed to be.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.719
>> i know, right?

08:40.721 --> 08:41.385
All right.

08:41.388 --> 08:42.621
But all kidding aside...

08:42.623 --> 08:43.288
>> uh-huh?

08:43.289 --> 08:43.989
>> we've entered

08:43.991 --> 08:45.724
Into a whole new level

08:45.726 --> 08:47.826
Of catfish correspondence here.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.630
So this is interesting.

08:51.632 --> 08:54.165
And it's the same address.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.868
>> no self-respecting catfish

08:56.870 --> 08:59.204
Puts their return address

08:59.206 --> 08:59.871
On an envelope.

08:59.873 --> 09:00.539
>> yeah.

09:00.541 --> 09:01.206
>> this person wants

09:01.208 --> 09:03.475
To be found.

09:03.477 --> 09:05.110
>> i don't feel like i have

09:05.112 --> 09:07.112
Been talking to a woman.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.079
The person i've been

09:08.081 --> 09:09.581
Talking to sounds like a dude.

09:09.583 --> 09:10.248
Do you want to hear

09:10.250 --> 09:11.316
The voice mails?

09:11.318 --> 09:11.983
>> sure.

09:11.985 --> 09:12.651
>> yeah.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.553
Let's hear this voice mail.

09:24.997 --> 09:25.764
>> wow.

09:25.766 --> 09:28.833
Is he always so emotional?

09:28.835 --> 09:30.068
>> mm-hmm.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.436
>> i think that that could be

09:31.438 --> 09:32.103
A woman.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.705
We don't know anything

09:33.707 --> 09:34.706
For sure right now,

09:34.708 --> 09:35.540
And we're gonna

09:35.542 --> 09:37.108
Do some investigating

09:37.110 --> 09:38.743
And find things out, but i think

09:38.745 --> 09:41.379
You got to start making space

09:41.381 --> 09:42.614
For the possibility

09:42.616 --> 09:45.250
That this could be that woman.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.953
>> he couldn't do that to me.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.454
You know?

09:49.456 --> 09:50.555
>> we're gonna figure this out.

09:50.557 --> 09:51.222
All right?

09:51.224 --> 09:52.724
>> okay. Yep.

09:52.726 --> 09:53.592
>> both: All right.

09:53.594 --> 09:54.292
>> we'll talk to you

09:54.294 --> 09:54.926
In a little bit.

09:54.928 --> 09:55.927
>> okay, i'll see you.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.295
>> good night.

09:57.297 --> 10:00.932
>> this is a serious story.

10:00.934 --> 10:01.600
Oh, man.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.835
When you see it and you feel her

10:03.837 --> 10:05.937
Wanting this relationship so bad

10:05.939 --> 10:06.771
And not being able to let go

10:06.773 --> 10:08.673
Of it, like, it really

10:08.675 --> 10:09.608
Comes through.

10:09.610 --> 10:10.308
>> but like,

10:10.310 --> 10:11.810
It's probably that woman.

10:11.812 --> 10:12.544
I mean,

10:12.546 --> 10:14.446
She sent her a driver's license.

10:14.448 --> 10:15.747
>> well, if nothing, that proves

10:15.749 --> 10:17.082
That that person's at least

10:17.084 --> 10:18.216
A part of the story.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.517
Still a lot of questions

10:19.519 --> 10:20.819
To get answers to.

10:27.893 --> 10:28.593
>> did you hear a knock

10:28.595 --> 10:29.227
At the door?

10:29.229 --> 10:29.894
>> i did hear a knock

10:29.896 --> 10:31.129
At the door.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.965
>> i wasn't expecting guests.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.500
Let me just freshen up.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.636
>> the parlor, here.

10:37.638 --> 10:40.705
>> hello?

10:40.707 --> 10:43.074
Oh...All right.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.209
We got work to do.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.378
This is yours.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.747
>> all right. Recap.

10:48.749 --> 10:52.384
>> andria met a guy named david

10:52.386 --> 10:55.487
Walker she's been dreaming of

10:55.489 --> 10:56.588
And in love

10:56.590 --> 10:57.889
With the last ten years.

10:57.891 --> 11:00.659
>> he won't skype or video chat.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.027
Then, a few months ago,

11:02.029 --> 11:02.961
David says,

11:02.963 --> 11:04.696
"you should drop out of school

11:04.698 --> 11:06.798
And come live with me."

11:06.800 --> 11:08.033
David never shows up.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.267
She's so annoyed

11:09.269 --> 11:10.468
And upset that she says,

11:10.470 --> 11:11.636
"i'm gonna bring you on <i> catfish.</i>

11:11.638 --> 11:12.537
We're gonna get to the bottom

11:12.539 --> 11:14.239
Of it," at which point,

11:14.241 --> 11:15.273
He freaks out

11:15.275 --> 11:16.207
And says, "no, no, no, no.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.242
Don't do that,"

11:17.244 --> 11:18.643
And sends her pictures,

11:18.645 --> 11:19.310
And he says,

11:19.312 --> 11:20.612
"this is who i really am,

11:20.614 --> 11:22.213
A woman named christina."

11:22.215 --> 11:23.648
>> and a photo holding up a

11:23.650 --> 11:24.482
Piece of paper that says,

11:24.484 --> 11:26.618
"sorry, andria."

11:26.620 --> 11:28.053
>> when we listened to the voice

11:28.055 --> 11:30.555
Mail that david left her,

11:30.557 --> 11:33.491
We both agreed that it could be

11:33.493 --> 11:34.592
A woman's voice.

11:34.594 --> 11:35.727
>> definitely.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.729
>> so that leaves us

11:37.731 --> 11:39.130
With a strong hunch

11:39.132 --> 11:40.632
That david is probably

11:40.634 --> 11:41.299
This woman,

11:41.301 --> 11:42.567
Christina, from chicago.

11:42.569 --> 11:43.234
>> i mean,

11:43.236 --> 11:44.569
I think it's more than a hunch.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.671
She has to let go of the fantasy

11:46.673 --> 11:47.338
That she's been

11:47.340 --> 11:48.606
Living for the last ten years.

11:48.608 --> 11:50.775
This guy is torturing her.

11:50.777 --> 11:53.144
So here's what we got.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.446
Here's the pictures

11:54.448 --> 11:56.414
Of christina.

11:56.416 --> 11:57.482
>> what the [bleep]?

11:57.484 --> 11:58.783
That is really freaky.

11:58.785 --> 11:59.451
>> i bet you

11:59.453 --> 12:00.418
She works at a hospital.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.186
>> she could be a nurse.

12:01.188 --> 12:01.853
>> yeah.

12:01.855 --> 12:02.987
I mean, that's what's crazy.

12:02.989 --> 12:03.822
This is the address.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.390
>> there it all is.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.157
>> and the address

12:06.159 --> 12:06.925
On the driver's license

12:06.927 --> 12:08.793
Matches the return address

12:08.795 --> 12:10.862
That they put on the letter.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.263
>> correct. This is pretty

12:12.265 --> 12:13.098
Conclusive evidence.

12:13.100 --> 12:13.765
>> i agree.

12:13.767 --> 12:14.866
>> but all right.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.601
>> all right, so she's got

12:16.603 --> 12:18.737
David walker's phone number.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.271
First thing's first.

12:20.273 --> 12:21.439
Let's search

12:21.441 --> 12:23.575
David walker's cell phone number

12:23.577 --> 12:27.011
And see what we get.

12:27.013 --> 12:27.979
>> not much.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.013
>> nothing, really.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.448
All right, let's run this email

12:30.450 --> 12:32.016
That andria's been talking to.

12:32.018 --> 12:33.251
Geostain?

12:33.253 --> 12:34.219
>> geostain.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.254
>> geostain.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.157
>> what do we got?

12:39.159 --> 12:39.824
Possible match.

12:39.826 --> 12:40.492
>> oh, boy.

12:40.494 --> 12:42.327
>> "gender: Female."

12:42.329 --> 12:44.129
>> whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:44.131 --> 12:48.333
Open link.

12:48.335 --> 12:53.671
