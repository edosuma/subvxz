Stand up.
Those seats are for clients!

01:00.364 --> 01:01.974
I'm a client.

01:02.105 --> 01:03.802
I am. I'm-I'm a client.

Oh, my mistake.

01:05.239 --> 01:06.892
You look so young,

I thought you were
one of our new associates.

The rest of you...

01:11.593 --> 01:13.203
let's go.

01:15.814 --> 01:17.729
This is the executive floor.

01:17.860 --> 01:20.689
You will only come up here
if invited.

-Those are the partners.

01:25.215 --> 01:26.738

leads to the offices
of STR Laurie,

01:32.875 --> 01:35.878
They are off-limits
to associates unless invited,

and you won't be invited.

01:40.187 --> 01:41.188
That's right.

01:42.406 --> 01:42.450

you play lawyer, Marissa.

How nice.

-This is someone from HR...
-Jenny Klay. Hello.

01:48.325 --> 01:50.588
She will take over from here.

01:50.719 --> 01:52.460
Any questions, ask her.

01:52.590 --> 01:54.375
Welcome to Reddick/Lockhart
and Associates.

01:54.505 --> 01:56.681
Why don't we go downstairs,
and we'll get better acquainted.

01:56.812 --> 01:59.902
-That's not an answer.
-Adrian founded this firm.

02:00.032 --> 02:01.425
He is not easily replaced.

DANIEL:
No one here is trying
to replace him.

02:03.253 --> 02:04.907
But some of us are more
than ready to step up

02:06.735 --> 02:07.431
-to a name partnership...
-Well, we're considering
every option.

02:08.998 --> 02:09.433
I'd like to understand the
new leadership structure here.

02:11.043 --> 02:12.088
Yes, well, Diane and I are
going to run the firm together,

02:12.219 --> 02:13.611
for now.

Just the two of you?

A Black firm being run
by a white woman?

02:18.138 --> 02:19.835
Well, I'm not running it alone.
I mean,

02:19.965 --> 02:21.663
I'm-I'm here to assist Liz.

02:21.793 --> 02:24.318
DANIEL: Really?
Because she needs assistance?

02:26.581 --> 02:28.583
As we pass this around,
I want everybody to take some,

02:28.713 --> 02:31.020
as much
or as little as you want.

02:33.196 --> 02:35.677
Tomorrow, you'll meet
your direct supervisors

02:35.807 --> 02:37.287
here at Reddick & Lockhart.

02:37.418 --> 02:41.509
Also, please be sure to bring
two copies of I.D. with you,

02:41.639 --> 02:43.163
as they will be required

02:43.293 --> 02:44.381
to complete
your onboarding paperwork.

02:44.512 --> 02:46.078
You'll have a meeting with HR...

It's an icebreaker.

02:47.515 --> 02:48.559
For every square you take,

02:49.778 --> 02:51.040
you have to tell a secret
about yourself.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.607
JENNY:
Good.

02:52.737 --> 02:55.087
Now, we'll go around,
introduce yourself,

02:55.218 --> 02:56.611
and for every square
of toilet paper,

02:56.741 --> 02:58.874
you have to say one
personal thing about yourself.

02:59.004 --> 03:01.006
[scattered groaning]

03:01.137 --> 03:02.312
Of course, there's
going to be a discussion.

03:02.443 --> 03:03.835
Is this the discussion?
Because I feel like

03:03.966 --> 03:05.794
it's just the two of you,
telling us what's what.

03:05.924 --> 03:07.143
Okay, we hear you,

03:07.274 --> 03:09.101
and we are going
to get back to you. I promise.

03:09.232 --> 03:12.192
But right now, our priority is
hiring a senior associate.

I'm not convinced we need one.

DIANE:
Well, Lucca was one of our best.

03:15.934 --> 03:16.544
And we need someone with
real experience

03:16.674 --> 03:18.372
to take on her caseload.

03:18.502 --> 03:20.809
Unless one of you
would like to step up

03:20.939 --> 03:22.724
and take over family law.

03:22.854 --> 03:26.293
Uh-huh. That's what I thought.

03:26.423 --> 03:27.772
Do you know Omar Peters?

03:27.903 --> 03:28.860
I don't.

03:28.991 --> 03:29.905
He's a really good headhunter.

-Sounds good.

working in lockstep.

What do you need, David?

03:38.174 --> 03:39.044
Which one of you is taking
Boseman's office?

03:40.437 --> 03:41.873
We... we hadn't discussed it.

03:42.004 --> 03:45.094
Well, discuss. The corner
office can't just sit empty.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.574
Looks like failure.

03:46.704 --> 03:48.358

03:48.489 --> 03:50.186
Tell us by Friday.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.884
And there are new hires
awaiting marching orders.

03:54.364 --> 03:56.323
I have a client meeting.
We'll discuss.

from Chicago. Chicago-Kent.

And your secrets?

04:07.508 --> 04:08.465
Secret.

04:08.596 --> 04:11.120
I used to be married to a mime,

04:11.251 --> 04:13.992
but it didn't work out, so...

Thank you, Marissa.

one of our two name partners.

Um, so we're all
gonna have a chance

04:40.454 --> 04:42.282
to get to know each other
a little bit later,

04:42.412 --> 04:45.720
and, uh, everybody
will have a mentor.

04:48.244 --> 04:51.813
All right, but today, we are
fulfilling client maintenance.

04:51.943 --> 04:54.206
We regularly check in
with our most valuable clients.

their names off on this list,

a particular interest,

all heard of him. All right.

05:25.237 --> 05:27.588
I guess we've all heard of him.

05:27.718 --> 05:29.851
Menard is maximum security.

05:29.981 --> 05:31.940
You will be very well protected.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.465
Good. Good, good.

I don't know. Is it bad news?

05:46.476 --> 05:48.478
Oh. No, not necessarily.

05:48.609 --> 05:51.307
I'll-I'll be fighting the same
case in two different courts.

05:51.438 --> 05:54.571
Mm. But this case has only one
plaintiff, so if we win,

05:54.702 --> 05:57.357
it sets a helpful precedent
for the large case.

05:57.487 --> 06:00.577
And if all of the plaintiffs
can't even agree on a venue,

06:00.708 --> 06:02.144
well, that's good for us.

06:02.274 --> 06:04.755
All I did was teach these
people's kids during COVID.

-But shouldn't you go, Diane?
-Oh, it's just a formality.

06:19.596 --> 06:21.990
I need to stay here
and work on your brief.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.600
I assure you,
you're in good hands, ma'am.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.341
Oh, and there's Marissa.

06:25.472 --> 06:28.213
Remember? She investigated
your case last year.

06:28.344 --> 06:29.563
Marissa?

06:29.693 --> 06:32.783
We need a continuance
on Toni Hedger's case.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.698
Really,
I get to argue a continuance?

06:34.829 --> 06:39.050
No. You get to accompany Phoebe
who will argue a continuance,

06:39.181 --> 06:40.835
and you get to
hold the client's hand.

06:40.965 --> 06:42.140
Okay?

06:42.271 --> 06:43.228
Okay.

06:55.371 --> 06:56.416
Carmen, right?

I don't want you
to be intimidated.

06:58.374 --> 06:59.244
He can sense fear.

06:59.375 --> 07:00.637
We have a half hour,

07:00.768 --> 07:02.770
but we don't need
more than ten minutes.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.424
There'll be a translator
in the room.

07:04.554 --> 07:06.948
Rivi will let us know
his complaints.

07:07.078 --> 07:08.384
We listen.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.604
We never commit.

07:10.734 --> 07:13.345
-Are you taking notes?
-Yes.

07:13.476 --> 07:15.783
There's basically nothing
we can do for him.

07:15.913 --> 07:17.698
It's more like
a venting session.

for you to talk at all.

-Sit, listen, leave.

-What?

I can't let you in.

07:27.316 --> 07:28.448
Your license expired,
three weeks ago.

07:28.578 --> 07:30.406
I couldn't renew it
during the pandemic.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.800
-Can't you just...
-No.

07:33.931 --> 07:35.150
I can do this.

Not alone you can't.

-Wackner.

Yeah. We have
an 11:00 a.m. summons.

-What?

08:14.624 --> 08:16.496
Look. It's not the 9th Circuit.

It's the nine
and three-quarters circuit.

Oh, come on.

08:22.632 --> 08:24.504

Yeah, I get that. Funny.

plaintiff just messing with us?

I'm not sure, ma'am.
But we'll call right away.

-He had a lot to say.

-Uh, Wi-Fi.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.751

-He doesn't like the food.
-And what did you say?

23:26.970 --> 23:29.103
I said I would bring
his concerns to the prison.

23:43.117 --> 23:45.424
-I have no idea.
-Then why are you arguing here?

23:45.554 --> 23:48.122
Why are you arguing at all?
You're not a lawyer.

23:48.252 --> 23:51.255
-If I didn't argue,
we were gonna lose.
-Lose what?

23:51.386 --> 23:54.215
This is not a court. We're in
the back of a Copy Coop.

23:54.345 --> 23:56.086

doing here?

23:56.217 --> 23:59.438
-He's representing
the plaintiff.
-Okay. I'm losing my mind.

23:59.568 --> 24:01.135

24:01.265 --> 24:02.353
We have got to get out of here.

24:02.484 --> 24:05.182
No. I don't want to.

24:06.270 --> 24:09.186
Toni, whatever happens here,
it's irrelevant.

24:09.317 --> 24:11.362
It doesn't matter
if we win or lose.

24:11.493 --> 24:12.755

24:12.886 --> 24:15.497
Those are some of the other
parents suing me.

24:15.628 --> 24:17.107
They're seeing
how this case goes.

24:17.238 --> 24:19.632
Which is why we don't
want to lose here.

One of the other teachers,
Janice, said that

heard Toni say,

Your Honor,
the hearsay rule prevents gossip

26:16.052 --> 26:17.793
from being used as evidence.

26:17.924 --> 26:20.230
How can you weigh
the truth of a statement,

26:20.361 --> 26:22.798
-unless it's made under oath?
-The same way I do in life.

26:22.929 --> 26:23.799

26:23.930 --> 26:25.496
You use your brains.

26:26.497 --> 26:28.282
So, did you say,

26:28.412 --> 26:30.197
-"You got to brainwash
these rich brats"?
-No.

26:30.327 --> 26:31.764
Yes, you did.

26:31.894 --> 26:33.896
No, I didn't, and you didn't
even hear it yourself.

26:34.027 --> 26:36.029
You said someone
heard it from someone...

26:36.159 --> 26:38.031
Well, they were both teachers
that I trusted.

26:38.161 --> 26:39.685
You tried to get more pay,

26:39.815 --> 26:42.122
and when I tried to hold you
to your contract, you quit.

26:42.252 --> 26:44.167
I quit because of your new
political emphasis.

26:44.298 --> 26:45.908
There was no political emphasis!

26:46.039 --> 26:48.389
You said that you couldn't trust
anybody who voted Republican.

26:48.519 --> 26:51.261
-No. That-that wasn't
what I said.
-What did you say?

26:51.392 --> 26:53.524
-Your Honor, may I have
a moment to confer?
-No.

26:53.655 --> 26:56.615
I like the truth that
is found in sudden utterances.

26:58.442 --> 26:59.835
What did you say?

26:59.966 --> 27:02.577
We were talking
about the Conways,

27:02.708 --> 27:04.187
and I said,

27:04.318 --> 27:07.974
I couldn't fall in love
with anyone who voted for Trump.

27:08.104 --> 27:09.976

-One for the P's.
-Your Honor,

27:17.723 --> 27:20.334
that has nothing
to do with this case.

27:20.464 --> 27:22.945
It is a private belief
held by my client.

27:23.076 --> 27:25.513
A belief that is shared
by most of the country...

27:25.644 --> 27:26.732
And do you share it?

27:26.862 --> 27:28.255
I'm not the question.

when COVID hit,

-Mm.

28:53.253 --> 28:54.820
Building something
in his spare time,

28:54.950 --> 28:56.735
because he thinks
he can do it better.

32:44.223 --> 32:46.225
We-we like to offer
our top clients more services

32:46.355 --> 32:47.922

-Liz.

32:48.053 --> 32:51.186
I've been working with my client
for five years now.

32:51.317 --> 32:53.014
He knows what he wants.

32:53.145 --> 32:54.929
He knows his mind.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.887
So, uh, make it happen,

32:57.018 --> 33:01.153
or you and I'll be having
a more unpleasant conversation.

33:01.283 --> 33:02.806
[chuckles]

33:04.765 --> 33:06.506
Mr. Lester, where are you?

33:06.636 --> 33:08.638
-Can I call you back?
-I am at the...

33:08.769 --> 33:10.597

33:10.727 --> 33:12.729
I'll call you back.

Because it has to be about race

35:00.620 --> 35:02.012
until it's about equality.

35:03.579 --> 35:05.146
Equality doesn't come through
more obsession with race.

35:05.277 --> 35:07.017
It comes from elevating talent
over mediocrity.

35:07.148 --> 35:08.802
Oh, come on, Kurt.
You and I both know

35:08.932 --> 35:10.499
that white mediocrity

35:13.241 --> 35:15.113
Well, then you're right.

be leading that firm.

35:51.932 --> 35:53.412
No. No. No, no.

35:53.542 --> 35:55.849
I just want to see how,
how things are going.

35:55.979 --> 35:58.765
Uh, I like it here.

35:58.895 --> 36:01.420
There's nothing to compare it
to except law school,

36:01.550 --> 36:04.292
but it's great to be
out of the legal clinics.

36:04.423 --> 36:08.166
At a certain point, simulation
feels like a waste of time.

36:08.296 --> 36:09.428
I'd rather
be in the thick of it.

36:09.558 --> 36:11.604
And now you are.

36:11.734 --> 36:14.781
I know you're working with Barry
on the Rivi maintenance.

36:14.911 --> 36:17.436
Yes. It's a-a wonderful
opportunity.

36:17.566 --> 36:21.527
Uh, Rivi's manager
has requested that, uh,

36:21.657 --> 36:24.573
-you take on a larger role.
-Really?

36:24.704 --> 36:27.837
Yeah. Rivi wants you
to be his only lawyer.

36:28.795 --> 36:31.537
I don't know what to say.
That's, um...

36:31.667 --> 36:32.886
surprising.

36:33.016 --> 36:36.194
See, Rivi has an unbelievable
amount of, uh,

36:36.324 --> 36:37.717
charisma.

36:37.847 --> 36:40.459
But in my experience,
it's-it's better

36:40.589 --> 36:43.244
to maintain
a professional distance.

36:43.375 --> 36:44.550
I'm very professional.

36:44.680 --> 36:46.682
Oh, I-I don't doubt it.

36:46.813 --> 36:48.118
But you yourself said...

36:48.249 --> 36:49.990
Is the firm dissatisfied
with my work?

36:50.120 --> 36:52.079
No.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.212
It's my intention

36:54.342 --> 36:57.040
to treat all my clients
like humans.

36:57.171 --> 36:59.217
Even the ones
who might be murderers

36:59.347 --> 37:01.741
or are definitely murderers.

37:01.871 --> 37:04.396
And I think Mr. Rivi
might be responding to that

37:04.526 --> 37:06.833
because it's something
that he hasn't received

37:06.963 --> 37:09.923
-at this firm previously...
-Okay. Let me be
very clear, Carmen.

37:10.053 --> 37:13.535
We are talking about your own
personal safety here.

37:13.666 --> 37:15.842
Yes, and I thank you.

37:15.972 --> 37:17.017

37:19.062 --> 37:22.240
If you want me not
to be involved with his case,

37:22.370 --> 37:24.633
I will completely understand.

37:26.940 --> 37:28.811
Mm.

37:28.942 --> 37:32.815
Well, I will admit, I was
surprised when I got the call.

37:32.946 --> 37:34.774
It's just so great
to see you, Julius.

-Yeah. How long has it been?

37:37.690 --> 37:40.258
Well, for Diane, it was when
I was being handcuffed

37:40.388 --> 37:41.824
and taken away to prison.

37:41.955 --> 37:44.349
It feels like forever,
but that's probably just 2020.

37:44.479 --> 37:47.352
Thank you for looking
past my troubles.

37:47.482 --> 37:50.137
I want you to know
I don't take that for granted.

37:50.268 --> 37:53.227
Last year was terrible.

37:53.358 --> 37:56.274
Diane, you stood by my side,

37:56.404 --> 37:57.840
and I can't ever
thank you enough.

37:57.971 --> 38:00.582

And I didn't even
have to pay for it.

38:08.416 --> 38:10.592
It's a good thing,
I couldn't afford one.

38:10.723 --> 38:11.767
Um, speaking of pay,

38:12.986 --> 38:13.900
we cannot pay you
what you made before.

38:14.030 --> 38:15.118
I need a job.

38:15.249 --> 38:16.859

I'm accepting a lower position,

38:26.695 --> 38:29.916

you're getting a deal.

It all happened so quick.

38:50.066 --> 38:52.939
The second schools closed,
I knew parents would need help.

38:53.069 --> 38:56.116
So, I rented some space,
and I put together a plan.

38:56.246 --> 38:57.639
-Very entrepreneurial of you.
-Thank you.

38:57.770 --> 39:00.468
I hired teachers,
which wasn't hard.

39:00.599 --> 39:02.340
There were so many layoffs.

39:02.470 --> 39:04.820
And I walked the parents
through the hours,

39:04.951 --> 39:07.257
the classes, the fees,
and the COVID protocols.

39:07.388 --> 39:09.825
[clears throat]
Sorry.

39:09.956 --> 39:11.000
[whispers]:
Curriculum.

39:11.131 --> 39:13.176
MARISSA:
And what about the curriculum?

39:13.307 --> 39:15.701
Did you agree to a teaching
philosophy, anything like that?

39:15.831 --> 39:17.703
It was at my discretion.
That was the agreement.

39:17.833 --> 39:19.879
And was that agreement
in the contract?

39:20.009 --> 39:21.402
Excuse me, Your Honor.
Can I finish my questions?

39:21.533 --> 39:23.839
Was any agreement about
the curriculum in the contract?

39:25.014 --> 39:27.365
It was part of the handshake
deal, Your Honor.

39:27.495 --> 39:29.976
They paid me on Venmo,
and I took care of the rest.

39:30.106 --> 39:32.413
But during COVID, how could they
have a handshake agreement,

39:32.544 --> 39:34.110
if there was no shaking hands?

39:34.241 --> 39:36.722
Mr. Schultz knows full well
"handshake deal"

39:36.852 --> 39:38.593
are acceptable words
in business.

39:38.724 --> 39:40.073
If there was no contract,

39:40.203 --> 39:42.380
my client should definitely
get her money back.

39:42.510 --> 39:44.120
-There was no deal.
-A handshake deal

39:44.251 --> 39:46.601
is still a binding contract,

39:46.732 --> 39:48.168
even in real...

39:48.298 --> 39:50.692
Uh, even in "usual" courts.

39:50.823 --> 39:52.694

39:56.132 --> 39:57.351

What one, Your Honor?

39:57.482 --> 39:59.614
-Plaintiff.
-Your Honor,

39:59.745 --> 40:01.442
the plaintiff can't just
pull out of an agreement

40:01.573 --> 40:03.183
whenever she wants.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.838
Who is it who said,

40:05.968 --> 40:09.145
"She should have watched
each card played

40:09.276 --> 40:11.626
-and played it slow."
-Excuse me?

40:11.757 --> 40:14.281
Every time we make a deal,
we're wondering what to choose.

40:14.412 --> 40:17.980
We watch each card,
wanting not to lose.

40:18.111 --> 40:19.721
And so you play it slow.

40:19.852 --> 40:22.463
Don't let the deal go down.

40:25.858 --> 40:27.729
What are you talking about?

"Since it costs a lot to win,

40:30.602 --> 40:32.255
"and even more to lose,

"you and me

a song is not evidence.

as much as the Roman code.

40:52.537 --> 40:53.451
Art is evidence.

Okay, then, your client started

40:56.149 --> 41:00.283
"counting her money when she was
sittin' at the table."

Yes, we do, Your Honor.

I'm new to this.

-Welcome, Counselor.

Everybody remembers
their first time.

42:42.647 --> 42:45.388
Although, yours does seem to
be decidedly more interesting.

-We've seen you
in here before, Mr. Rivi.
-Oh, yeah.

42:48.609 --> 42:52.134
Your Honor, uh,
this is a habeas corpus motion.

42:52.265 --> 42:54.615
In meeting last time,
with my client,

42:54.746 --> 42:56.965
I realized he might be innocent

he was accused of...

43:08.107 --> 43:09.151
of competing gang members.

43:09.282 --> 43:10.979
It occurred to me,

43:11.110 --> 43:13.634
these killings had many
of the same characteristics

43:13.765 --> 43:15.418
as the murder
my client was accused of.

43:15.549 --> 43:17.159
A jury decided this, Your Honor.

43:17.290 --> 43:19.553
Yes, but they did not
have the facts we have now.

43:19.684 --> 43:22.730
This is the lawyer
representing Mr. Vanegas.

43:22.861 --> 43:25.515
And he has something for us.

43:25.646 --> 43:28.214
-Charles Lester, Your Honor.
-Yes, I recognize you, too.

43:28.344 --> 43:30.303
-Hi.
-Hey.

43:30.433 --> 43:33.001
My client
had a guilty conscience,

43:33.132 --> 43:36.091
and wanted to come clean
before he served his time.

43:36.222 --> 43:37.745
Oh, dear God.

43:38.790 --> 43:41.619
Can I speak here
without being interrupted?

43:41.749 --> 43:42.707
STILTON:
Yes.

43:43.838 --> 43:45.318
My client swears
that he is responsible

43:45.448 --> 43:49.278
for the crime
that Mr. Rivi is accused of.

43:49.409 --> 43:52.586
In fact,
he has given sworn testimony

43:52.717 --> 43:54.675
as to the whereabouts
of the weapon.

43:54.806 --> 43:56.764
The-the gun the police
never found.

43:56.895 --> 43:58.940
The one they accused my client
of using.

43:59.071 --> 44:00.507
STILTON:
This is all very convenient.

44:00.638 --> 44:03.466
Your Honor,
the only thing that's convenient

44:03.597 --> 44:07.645
is that I'm new to the law and
believed my client's innocence.

44:07.775 --> 44:10.038
-So I investigated. That is all.
-Your Honor,

44:10.169 --> 44:11.953
clearly this lawyer
acted as a go-between

44:12.084 --> 44:13.433
for two murderous criminals,

44:13.563 --> 44:15.740
allowing Vanegas to acquire
the facts he needed

44:15.870 --> 44:18.177
-to help his boss, Rivi...
-Your Honor.

44:18.307 --> 44:20.440
-We're not that sophisticated.
-Here are prison records,

44:20.570 --> 44:24.270
showing that Ms. Moyo visited
Vanegas in his cell

44:24.400 --> 44:26.664
24 hours
after her visit with Rivi.

44:26.794 --> 44:29.318
Yes, and if you have any doubt
of what was said,

44:29.449 --> 44:30.580
review the prison tapes.

44:30.711 --> 44:32.582
I was not Mr. Vanegas's lawyer,

44:32.713 --> 44:35.107
so my communication with him
was not privileged.

44:35.237 --> 44:36.978
You'll see,
I said nothing incriminating.

44:37.109 --> 44:40.373
I was just there to support
my client.

44:40.503 --> 44:41.548
-That's all.
-STILTON: Okay.

44:42.810 --> 44:44.812
Thank you. I will review
all these materials.

44:44.943 --> 44:47.249
But I need Ms. Moyo
to approach the bench, please.

44:55.823 --> 44:58.217
I thought I should be here,
too, for this.

44:58.347 --> 45:00.219
STILTON:
Uh-huh. Uh...

45:00.349 --> 45:02.308
You, um, you haven't been
at this very long.

45:02.438 --> 45:03.483
Have you, miss?

45:03.613 --> 45:04.963
No, Your Honor.

45:05.093 --> 45:07.443
Everyone's entitled
to legal representation,

45:07.574 --> 45:10.577
and I'm sure you never intend
to do anything illegal

45:10.708 --> 45:13.145
-or unethical...
-Of course not, Your Honor.

45:13.275 --> 45:15.625
You know, these are some rough
customers you're dealing with.

45:15.756 --> 45:18.237
Don't let them take advantage
of your inexperience.

45:18.367 --> 45:20.718
I'll help her
where I can, Your Honor.

45:20.848 --> 45:23.416
That is small comfort,
Mr. Lester.

45:23.546 --> 45:25.200
Ms. Moyo...

45:25.331 --> 45:28.638
there are a lot of bad actors
taking advantage of the system.

45:28.769 --> 45:30.336
Don't make yourself
vulnerable to them.

45:30.466 --> 45:33.905
-Well, I'm not sure...
-I need you to shut the hell up.

45:34.035 --> 45:35.167
Huh?

45:36.864 --> 45:38.213
CARMEN:
Thank you, Your Honor.

45:38.344 --> 45:40.172
I will keep that in mind.

45:40.302 --> 45:42.000
Good.

45:52.488 --> 45:53.751
While I recognize

45:53.881 --> 45:56.014
that you just had
a victory in court,

45:56.144 --> 45:59.017
the long-term reputation
of this firm

45:59.147 --> 46:02.890
matters a whole lot more to me
than short-term wins.

46:03.021 --> 46:04.631
That makes sense.

46:04.762 --> 46:06.938
I'm not going to ask you
any questions

46:07.068 --> 46:09.767
about what you may
or may not have done.

46:10.985 --> 46:12.508
You're a capable lawyer.
Clearly.

46:12.639 --> 46:14.554
That's why you were hired.

46:14.684 --> 46:17.296
This is just a reminder
that you are to conduct yourself

46:17.426 --> 46:19.689
in a matter, at all times,

46:19.820 --> 46:21.779
that does not put this firm
at risk.

46:21.909 --> 46:24.259
This is the only reminder
you're going to get.

46:27.219 --> 46:29.134
Do you have any questions?

46:31.223 --> 46:32.311
I'm just listening.

46:32.441 --> 46:35.357
Wow. You, you really
don't give a shit

46:35.488 --> 46:37.533
what people think about you,
do you?

46:38.578 --> 46:41.668
I'm here to do a good job
for my clients.

46:41.799 --> 46:44.410
I think I did that for Mr. Rivi.

46:44.540 --> 46:47.413
And since he wants me to be
the only one to represent him,

46:47.543 --> 46:48.849
I'll...

46:50.242 --> 46:51.678
I'll focus on that.

46:53.158 --> 46:54.855
Okay.

46:54.986 --> 46:56.814
We're done.

46:58.293 --> 46:59.991
Thank you.

47:05.300 --> 47:07.259
By the way, I'm your mentor.

47:07.389 --> 47:09.435
I'll need you here Friday
to discuss.

47:09.565 --> 47:11.480
Thank you, Ms. Reddick.

47:15.267 --> 47:17.704
I respected your father.

47:27.496 --> 47:31.022
[siren wailing in distance]

47:31.152 --> 47:33.676
Your Honor, the defense calls
Isabel Pressley.

47:33.807 --> 47:35.461
NELL:
What the hell is she doing here?

47:35.591 --> 47:37.942
SCHULTZ: You didn't give us
any notice of this witness.

47:38.072 --> 47:39.334
I'm sorry. Do we have to?

47:40.814 --> 47:41.771
I thought truth was always found
in sudden utterances.

47:43.251 --> 47:46.037
You just got yourself
half a bell for quoting me.

47:46.167 --> 47:48.213
-Thank you, Your Honor.
-Thank you.

47:48.343 --> 47:50.998
Ms. Pressley,
you were the first parent

47:51.129 --> 47:53.131
to withdraw your child
from Poducation, correct?

47:53.261 --> 47:55.698
Yes, but I didn't ask
for my money back.

47:55.829 --> 47:58.136
-Because Toni did nothing wrong.
-So, if you had no problem
with the teaching,

47:58.266 --> 47:59.702
-why did you pull out?
-Because the other parents...

48:01.313 --> 48:03.271
Hi, guys. They were going to
get us all killed with COVID.

48:03.402 --> 48:06.013
-Especially her.
-This is ridiculous.

48:06.144 --> 48:07.536
MARISSA:
That is quite a charge.
What do you mean?

48:07.667 --> 48:09.843
She kept inviting
the other kids over to her house

48:09.974 --> 48:12.367
for slumber parties, no masks,
totally against the rules.

48:12.498 --> 48:15.022
-So that explains it.
-How do you know?

48:15.153 --> 48:16.937
She put pictures on Facebook.

48:17.068 --> 48:19.722
You get that made up next door?

48:19.853 --> 48:21.942
Yes, Your Honor, at Copy Coop.

48:22.073 --> 48:23.248
A good deal.

48:23.378 --> 48:24.771
Don't suck up too much.

48:24.902 --> 48:26.425
It's, uh, good product
placement, very good.

48:26.555 --> 48:27.817
ISABEL:
She doesn't give a shit about

48:27.948 --> 48:29.819
what anybody teaches Miranda.

48:29.950 --> 48:32.474
The pod shut down because
Nell was a super-spreader.

48:32.605 --> 48:34.868
You're just jealous because your
stupid kid was never invited.

48:34.999 --> 48:37.436
Your Honor, we believe this
proves that the plaintiff's

48:37.566 --> 48:40.787
claim of socialist teaching
was an excuse to cover up

48:40.918 --> 48:44.138
her own irresponsibility
and deny hardworking educators

48:44.269 --> 48:47.054
the money that they had earned.

48:47.185 --> 48:48.664
One second.

48:48.795 --> 48:51.537
Dean. Defense.

48:51.667 --> 48:53.626
-[applause]
-SCHULTZ: Your Honor, we
haven't had closing arguments.

48:53.756 --> 48:55.236
Yeah, I'm not in the mood.
I'm ready to rule.

48:55.367 --> 48:57.195
Everybody sit down. Relax.

48:57.325 --> 49:00.676
So, this side
broke the COVID rules.

49:00.807 --> 49:01.851
That's not good.

49:03.070 --> 49:04.028
Then again, let's be honest,
who hasn't?

49:04.158 --> 49:06.944
Still, she paid.
So she has a right

49:07.074 --> 49:08.946
to complain
about the service she got.

49:09.076 --> 49:11.426
On the other hand,
this lady was doing her best

49:11.557 --> 49:14.168
to challenge her students
to think critically

49:14.299 --> 49:15.561
about the world they came from.

49:15.691 --> 49:17.824
Even if she used Parasite,

49:17.955 --> 49:19.913
a movie I thought had moments.

49:20.044 --> 49:22.176
Wasn't as good
as Hell or High Water.

49:22.307 --> 49:23.830
And in the end,

49:23.961 --> 49:27.007
the parents chose to outsource
the education of their kids

49:27.138 --> 49:29.227
when most people had
to teach them at home.

49:29.357 --> 49:31.098
You could have done that,
you didn't.

49:31.229 --> 49:32.970
You can't ask
for your money back after.

49:33.100 --> 49:35.320
I'm siding with you.

49:35.450 --> 49:38.018
Just lighten up
on the lefty stuff next time.

49:38.149 --> 49:40.499
Oh, and you have to pay
for her lawyer

49:40.629 --> 49:42.675
because this was bullshit.

49:42.805 --> 49:44.590
-[gavel bangs]
-Done.

49:44.720 --> 49:47.201
See? I knew we'd do better here.

49:47.332 --> 49:49.421
I have to say,
his ruling was reasonable.

49:49.551 --> 49:50.639
WACKNER:
Wait a minute. Hold it.

49:50.770 --> 49:52.119
I'm brain-dead. I almost forgot.

49:53.686 --> 49:56.123
I have found that the thing
we most crave, win or lose,

49:56.254 --> 49:59.387
is respect and acknowledgment.

49:59.518 --> 50:02.086
So, I want everyone
to shake hands.

50:02.216 --> 50:04.740
You mean literally?

50:04.871 --> 50:06.699
Two sides, two lines.
Go down the line,

50:06.829 --> 50:09.484
shake hands, look each other
in the eye and say,

50:09.615 --> 50:12.487
"I respect and I love you."

50:12.618 --> 50:14.054
Because the law means nothing

50:14.185 --> 50:15.838
if people don't feel
respect for it,

50:15.969 --> 50:17.057
and each other.

50:17.188 --> 50:18.319
Come on.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

50:18.450 --> 50:20.147
Let's go. We don't have all day.

50:20.278 --> 50:21.757
I got a line around the block.

50:21.888 --> 50:23.542
Come on.

50:25.848 --> 50:28.329
BOTH:
I respect and I love you.

50:28.460 --> 50:30.505
I think you could have each
done better, but let's go.

50:30.636 --> 50:33.856
-BOTH: I respect and I love you.
-There you go. Smiling face.

50:33.987 --> 50:35.858
BOTH:
I respect and I love you.

50:35.989 --> 50:36.990
Smile, baby. There you go.

50:37.121 --> 50:38.600
MAN:
I respect and I love you.

50:41.647 --> 50:43.214
Do you have a card?

50:43.344 --> 50:44.954
N-No. Do I need one?

50:45.085 --> 50:46.478
Write down your number.

50:46.608 --> 50:48.349
I need a lawyer here.

50:50.308 --> 50:52.397
DIANE: "I respect you
and I love you."

50:52.527 --> 50:54.660
-[laughing]
-Ha. No.

50:54.790 --> 50:56.966
[laughs]:
Oh, my God.

50:57.097 --> 50:58.881
It's too bad he's not a lawyer.

50:59.012 --> 51:01.580
We could hire him.

51:01.710 --> 51:03.538
We could do worse.

51:03.669 --> 51:07.281
-[laughing]
-Oh, so, speaking of.

51:08.630 --> 51:10.284
I say it's Julius.

51:10.415 --> 51:11.720
Julius?

51:11.851 --> 51:14.288
Convicted of bribery,
pardoned by Trump, Julius.

51:14.419 --> 51:16.682
[laughs]:
Yes. Yes.

51:16.812 --> 51:20.294
Yes, I've... I've thought
about it, and we know him.

51:20.425 --> 51:21.730
We trust him.

51:21.861 --> 51:24.385
I like Julius.

51:24.516 --> 51:26.257
Yeah. I like him, too.

51:26.387 --> 51:30.391
Yeah, and he's right,
it is a good deal for us.

51:32.393 --> 51:34.613
You slept with Caleb,
didn't you?

51:37.137 --> 51:40.053
I'm going to go call Julius.

51:41.837 --> 51:43.317
Great.

51:43.448 --> 51:45.493
Oh, and one more thing...

51:48.670 --> 51:50.803
This is an
African American firm,

51:50.933 --> 51:53.849
and it deserves a Black partner
in the corner office.

51:53.980 --> 51:55.373
-You take it.
-Diane.

51:55.503 --> 51:57.288
I insist.

51:58.637 --> 52:00.682
Part of me feels like
I should thank you,

52:00.813 --> 52:02.162
and another part of me doesn't.

52:02.293 --> 52:03.598
So...

52:04.904 --> 52:06.340
Thank you.

52:07.863 --> 52:09.474
And one more thing.

52:09.604 --> 52:11.867
I thought
that was the last thing.

52:14.087 --> 52:15.436
I've thought about this.

52:17.482 --> 52:20.354
I believe I contribute
to this firm.

52:20.485 --> 52:23.488
And I worry
I'm going to be pushed aside.

52:23.618 --> 52:25.098
So...

52:25.229 --> 52:28.101
I think we need another
African American partner,

52:28.232 --> 52:30.973
and we should discuss whom.

52:31.104 --> 52:32.932
But I want a commitment
from you that

52:33.062 --> 52:35.674
I will retain
a name-partner position.

52:35.804 --> 52:37.241
No matter what.

52:40.200 --> 52:41.810
Diane...

52:41.941 --> 52:45.292
as long as I have any power
over the decision,

52:45.423 --> 52:48.426
you will retain
your name-partner position.

52:49.427 --> 52:51.080
Thank you.

52:51.211 --> 52:53.387
And let's discuss
a third partner, huh?

52:53.518 --> 52:55.302
Okay.

53:00.481 --> 53:02.179
[door closes]

53:11.449 --> 53:13.364
How was your first week?

53:13.494 --> 53:15.017
Okay.

53:15.148 --> 53:16.149
You?

53:16.280 --> 53:18.020
-[elevator dings]
-Good.

53:23.069 --> 53:25.506
[sighs] So...

53:25.637 --> 53:27.291
I guess it begins.
