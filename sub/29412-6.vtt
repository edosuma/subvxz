WEBVTT

00:07.898 --> 00:08.978
Sorry, Dr. Andrews.

00:09.066 --> 00:11.273
I had a patient
with some post-op arm pain.

00:11.390 --> 00:12.695
How can I help you?

00:12.940 --> 00:15.164
What's happened
to all the nurses?

00:17.244 --> 00:18.292
Hello.

00:18.380 --> 00:21.127
My name is
Dr. Shaun Murphy,

00:21.215 --> 00:23.343
surgical resident
year three.

00:23.431 --> 00:26.451
I will be assisted
by Dr. Claire Browne

00:26.539 --> 00:28.570
on today's open appendectomy.

00:28.665 --> 00:32.148
I will not be putting on my
number 7 sterile gloves myself,

00:32.274 --> 00:34.023
as I am lead surgeon.

00:34.111 --> 00:38.044
Nurse Fletch,
can you adjust the overhead light?

00:38.132 --> 00:39.880
How many degrees,
Dr. Murphy?

00:39.968 --> 00:42.615
Ah, yes.
I should be more specific.

00:42.702 --> 00:45.109
A 35-degree angle.

00:46.525 --> 00:50.484
Nurse Hawks,
please hand me the 10 blade.

00:56.050 --> 00:59.179
Straight clamp, please,
Nurse Fletch.

01:01.407 --> 01:03.055
Hello, Dr. Andrews.

01:03.158 --> 01:06.341
I'm going to try
to pretend you're not here.

01:06.593 --> 01:08.408
You have not pretended
to scrub in

01:08.495 --> 01:10.343
and may not be here
when here is there,

01:10.430 --> 01:12.326
there being O.R. 2
later today.

01:12.414 --> 01:15.015
You don't need a full
surgical team to rehearse.

01:15.102 --> 01:17.016
Some of this staff needs
to get back to their stations.

01:17.103 --> 01:18.985
No.
They can stay here.

01:19.073 --> 01:23.372
Chief Lim has assigned me
my second first surgery,

01:23.460 --> 01:25.125
and she assigned
them all to me

01:25.212 --> 01:27.260
and told me to rehearse
with all of them

01:27.347 --> 01:29.984
unless and until there's
an emergency on their floor.

01:31.355 --> 01:35.078
Dr. Browne,
please hand me the Bovie.

01:35.855 --> 01:38.216
Dr. Browne had a dental
appointment this morning.

01:38.304 --> 01:41.168
I'm doing my best to be
annoyingly caring and empathetic

01:41.256 --> 01:42.557
in her stead.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074

02:11.545 --> 02:13.139
There's the baby.

02:13.437 --> 02:15.142
And there's the mass.

02:15.648 --> 02:17.010
Way too close together.

02:17.097 --> 02:18.818
A biopsy
is out of the question.

02:18.906 --> 02:21.851
Best course is to go in
and remove the entire mass.

02:22.436 --> 02:24.265
Will that be dangerous
for the baby?

02:24.421 --> 02:27.054
The odds of your daughter
being harmed are very low.

02:27.171 --> 02:29.054
And what about
recovery time?

02:29.242 --> 02:30.296
How long?

02:30.404 --> 02:32.710
Normal recovery
is about three weeks.

02:32.953 --> 02:34.765
We're opening
a specialty toy store.

02:34.853 --> 02:36.773
I need to be
up and about in a week.

02:36.906 --> 02:38.210
Tell 'em, Andre.

02:38.298 --> 02:39.895
Sustainable natural toys.

02:39.983 --> 02:42.532
Good for the kids,
good for the world.

02:42.915 --> 02:46.031
I don't really want to leave
Andre to fight the crowds alone.

02:46.176 --> 02:47.984
Well, a week
is not realistic.

02:48.072 --> 02:50.031
Too much stress on your
body after the surgery

02:50.119 --> 02:51.861
could put the pregnancy
at risk.

02:53.683 --> 02:54.784
It's okay.

02:55.095 --> 02:56.376
Andre worries.

02:56.682 --> 02:59.572
Thought it was too much to
start a business and a family

02:59.660 --> 03:02.228
all before
our first anniversary.

03:03.062 --> 03:05.244
Business and family
are easy.

03:06.150 --> 03:09.853
If I'd known it was business
and family and cancer,

03:10.478 --> 03:12.501
I... might have waited
on one of them.

03:15.083 --> 03:17.431
Let's just worry about
the surgery right now.

03:17.693 --> 03:18.928
Okay?

03:24.606 --> 03:25.978
Dr. Lim.

03:26.359 --> 03:29.342
Just came from
Dr. Murphy's improv class.

03:29.430 --> 03:31.994
I don't remember Browne
getting a full-team rehearsal

03:32.082 --> 03:33.579
before her first surgery.

03:33.667 --> 03:35.642
Our residents
are not homogeneous.

03:35.730 --> 03:38.439
Each one requires different
attention and training.

03:38.527 --> 03:39.314
I agree.

03:39.402 --> 03:41.665
And for Shaun, that means
less training wheels

03:41.753 --> 03:43.000
and more scabbed knees.

03:43.088 --> 03:44.931
Trust me, his knees
will get scabbed.

03:45.019 --> 03:46.621
I'm trying to prevent
a decapitation.

03:46.709 --> 03:48.115
- If he's not ready...
- Why don't you follow

03:48.203 --> 03:49.279
your own advice?

03:49.367 --> 03:51.966
You think this is the wrong option,
stop telling me.

03:52.054 --> 03:53.669
Let me fail and learn.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.794
But be sure to apologize
when you realize I was right.

03:59.368 --> 04:02.908
The appendix can be
removed in various ways,

04:03.070 --> 04:05.822
including suture ligation,
purse-stringing,

04:05.910 --> 04:07.431
and inversion
appendectomy.

04:07.519 --> 04:11.002
I will be using the
suture ligation technique.

04:11.151 --> 04:14.009
Dr. Browne,
place a clamp just proximal

04:14.097 --> 04:16.392
to the distal ligature
on the appendix.

04:16.493 --> 04:17.861
How's it going
with Carly?

04:18.603 --> 04:23.103
Divide sharply and cauterize
the exposed mucosa.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.702
Isn't dating life
wonderful?

04:24.790 --> 04:26.619
Everything
you hoped it would be?

04:29.001 --> 04:33.845
Please refrain from asking
non-surgical questions, Morgan.

04:33.945 --> 04:36.028
I need to concentrate
on the next step

04:36.116 --> 04:37.596
in my O.R. management.

04:37.684 --> 04:39.499
And I need to be Claire.

04:39.587 --> 04:41.470
Is there any chance
she's not gonna be concerned

04:41.558 --> 04:43.440
about your personal
well-being and inquire?

04:43.528 --> 04:44.795
Repeatedly?

04:49.602 --> 04:54.040
Things are going well,
Dr. Browne.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.496
We make out a lot.

04:56.442 --> 04:58.823
Let's close
the peritoneal cavity.

04:58.911 --> 05:01.400
Did you guys have lots of fun
on your last day off?

05:02.294 --> 05:04.056
I went to the museum.

05:04.144 --> 05:04.908
Mm.

05:04.996 --> 05:08.822
Nurse Hawks, please check
the patient's vitals.

05:08.946 --> 05:10.392
Everything looks normal.

05:11.097 --> 05:12.117
You went alone?

05:12.205 --> 05:14.462
I called Carly
at her house

05:14.550 --> 05:17.466
to see if she wanted
to play Chinese checkers.

05:17.589 --> 05:19.400
Close the external
oblique fascia

05:19.488 --> 05:21.439
with a continuous
2-0 vicryl stitch.

05:21.527 --> 05:24.126
Although they're not
really Chinese.

05:24.276 --> 05:27.558
It's actually a game of German
origin called Sternhalma.

05:27.646 --> 05:28.727
It's very fun.

05:28.815 --> 05:32.659
I will use 4-0 monocryl
subcuticular interrupted sutures

05:32.747 --> 05:33.947
for skin closure.

05:34.035 --> 05:36.556
However, Carly said
she could not hang out

05:36.644 --> 05:37.931
because she was busy.

05:38.019 --> 05:39.367
If the wound
was contaminated,

05:39.455 --> 05:40.822
we could leave in
a Penrose drain

05:40.910 --> 05:42.783
and remove it
two to three days later,

05:42.871 --> 05:44.220
but it is not.

05:44.308 --> 05:45.788
She had friends over.

05:46.037 --> 05:48.232
I could hear laughing
in the background.

05:48.320 --> 05:52.185
Dr. Browne, approximate
all split muscle layers.

05:55.761 --> 05:57.295
That's odd.

05:58.654 --> 06:00.225
Nothing is odd.

06:00.351 --> 06:02.900
We just have
two more steps and...

06:02.988 --> 06:06.973
No. That whatever she was
doing, she didn't invite you.

06:10.095 --> 06:11.435
Why?

06:11.523 --> 06:13.715
She isn't treating you
like a boyfriend.

06:13.803 --> 06:17.232
You don't exclude your significant
other from a get-together.

06:17.320 --> 06:19.497
That's not true.
It could have been a family thing.

06:19.585 --> 06:22.080
Or maybe she thinks it's too early
to introduce you to her friends.

06:22.167 --> 06:25.271
It's also possible that there
was no get-together at all.

06:25.359 --> 06:27.341
I mean, maybe you just
heard the television.

06:27.429 --> 06:30.427
Maybe she just doesn't
see you as her boyfriend.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.551
Has she ever called
you her boyfriend?

06:41.009 --> 06:43.466
We have practiced enough.

07:03.598 --> 07:05.443
You had a dental appointment
this morning.

07:06.430 --> 07:07.544
The reason you're late.

07:07.670 --> 07:10.279
So brush extra well
and don't forget to floss.

07:11.177 --> 07:12.276
Thanks.

07:12.364 --> 07:13.600
Don't take this
the wrong way,

07:13.687 --> 07:15.495
but when did you get
so slutty?

07:15.583 --> 07:17.769
I'm not. Thank you
for covering. Now...

07:17.857 --> 07:20.380
This smells like it's been
dipped in Drakkar cologne.

07:21.474 --> 07:24.044
Do you really care
what I wear or what I do?

07:24.132 --> 07:25.413
I care when you're late.

07:25.501 --> 07:28.206
I care about the amount of extra
work I have to do covering for you.

07:28.294 --> 07:29.261
I was an hour late.

07:29.349 --> 07:30.886
How much extra work
could that be?

07:30.974 --> 07:32.108
One hour's worth.

07:32.195 --> 07:35.138
So, you can thank me by taking
two hours off my hands.

07:39.136 --> 07:40.271
Thank you.

07:51.737 --> 07:53.085
Hey, Shaun.

07:53.476 --> 07:54.477
Hello.

07:56.206 --> 07:57.513
Waiting for Carly?

07:57.820 --> 08:00.269
I want to know why

08:00.357 --> 08:02.880
she did not invite me
to her get-together.

08:03.842 --> 08:05.449
Might have a better chance
of finding out

08:05.537 --> 08:07.216
if you were
physically closer to her.

08:08.898 --> 08:10.286
Maybe later.

08:12.490 --> 08:15.927
This prescription should help
him feel a little bit better.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.409
And if I may suggest,

08:18.497 --> 08:21.700
don't store the chocolate
laxatives in the candy drawer.

08:25.047 --> 08:26.121
- Hi.
- Hey.

08:26.209 --> 08:29.225
I was wondering if you could
get away for lunch.

08:29.670 --> 08:32.325
Yeah. Let me see if I can
move some things around.

08:32.413 --> 08:33.866
- Come on in.
- All right.

08:37.260 --> 08:38.847
I got fired.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.129
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

08:41.226 --> 08:42.240
What happened?

08:42.328 --> 08:44.637
I was giving away
free coffee.

08:44.866 --> 08:46.370
We work in a hospital,

08:46.458 --> 08:48.284
and I hear a lot
of sad stories.

08:48.450 --> 08:50.354
And sometimes when they're
really, really sad,

08:50.442 --> 08:52.080
I like to give that person
a free coffee,

08:52.168 --> 08:53.299
and it makes them smile.

08:53.387 --> 08:56.041
And yes, okay, I know.
It's against policy.

08:56.129 --> 08:58.712
But you'd think
my asshat boss

08:58.800 --> 09:00.159
would give me
more than two warnings

09:00.246 --> 09:02.501
before giving me the ax.

09:02.589 --> 09:04.353
Okay. What do you
want me to do?

09:04.441 --> 09:05.481
You want me
to beat him up?

09:07.146 --> 09:09.137
I want you to come home
for lunch

09:09.225 --> 09:11.472
and I want to bitch
about my ex-boss

09:11.560 --> 09:13.925
and I want someone
there to...

09:14.703 --> 09:15.704
Listen.

09:18.414 --> 09:19.589
Okay.

09:19.870 --> 09:21.603
Use a
tenaculum to grasp the lesion

09:21.691 --> 09:23.066
to create
countertraction.

09:23.202 --> 09:26.550
I'm gonna separate the mass
from the underlying myometrium.

09:29.969 --> 09:32.230
- Damn it.
- Let's get suction.

09:35.752 --> 09:38.347
The mass has surrounded
the uterine arteries.

09:38.496 --> 09:40.237
We can't remove the mass
without killing the baby.

09:40.324 --> 09:42.986
Dr. Reznick, if you were lead,
how would you proceed?

09:43.074 --> 09:44.714
We're already in, so...

09:44.835 --> 09:46.712
I'd biopsy the mass
for testing.

09:46.800 --> 09:49.229
Then I'd perform an embolization
of the arteries feeding the tumor.

09:49.316 --> 09:51.142
Very good. Dr. Park,
what does that do?

09:51.230 --> 09:53.595
It should allow us
to control the bleeding

09:53.683 --> 09:56.057
so we can close her up and leave
the baby in place for two months.

09:56.144 --> 09:59.080
That'll give the baby time to
become viable outside the womb.

09:59.168 --> 10:01.361
At that point,
we go back in,

10:01.449 --> 10:03.087
safely take out
the baby and the mass.

10:03.175 --> 10:04.399
Sounds like the
right call to me.

10:04.487 --> 10:05.916
We'll be performing
an embolization

10:06.004 --> 10:07.284
of the arteries
feeding the tumor.

10:07.371 --> 10:09.496
- I'll inform Chief Lim.
- Not necessary.

10:09.811 --> 10:11.509
It's protocol
to run all decisions

10:11.597 --> 10:14.300
about complex procedures
by the Chief of Surgery.

10:14.388 --> 10:16.191
There's only
one clear path,

10:16.285 --> 10:18.410
which means
there is no decision.

10:33.634 --> 10:34.949
In my office, please.

10:39.289 --> 10:41.577
I didn't think
you'd mind.

10:41.812 --> 10:44.413
We always complained about
Andrews and his red tape.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.177
Well, I hoped
that our relationship

10:46.265 --> 10:48.124
was better than whatever
you had with Andrews.

10:48.225 --> 10:49.902
It is, but I know
you're busy.

10:49.999 --> 10:52.130
- You don't need to be bothered...
- You know how this makes me look?

10:52.217 --> 10:53.890
You know
how this makes me look?

10:55.861 --> 10:58.093
This job was
on your to-do list.

10:59.507 --> 11:01.028
Lab must have
made a mistake.

11:01.116 --> 11:02.335
I'll deal with it.

11:02.441 --> 11:03.903
We might have
a bigger issue

11:03.991 --> 11:06.028
than you lying
about the blood test.

11:06.116 --> 11:07.210
I'm not lying.

11:07.298 --> 11:08.979
Like I said,
this is a bigger issue.

11:09.152 --> 11:10.366
Shaun is distracted.

11:10.453 --> 11:11.467
Well, why would he be...

11:11.554 --> 11:13.038
Because you were
at the dentist.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.849
Nurse Hawks
asked some questions.

11:14.937 --> 11:16.474
Carly didn't invite Shaun
to something,

11:16.562 --> 11:18.787
and now he's worried that they're
not boyfriend and girlfriend.

11:18.874 --> 11:19.825
So, did you talk to him?

11:19.913 --> 11:21.538
No.
That's what you do.

11:21.626 --> 11:22.811
Think I put it
on your list,

11:22.906 --> 11:24.898
"be kind and care,"
so I don't have to.

11:25.368 --> 11:26.810
Okay.
I'll talk to him.

11:26.898 --> 11:28.052
Talk to Carly first.

11:28.140 --> 11:29.583
You can do it
when you drop off the blood vials

11:29.671 --> 11:31.585
and pretend
it's the second time.

11:33.516 --> 11:36.158
This is good. It's good.
You were wasted there.

11:36.246 --> 11:38.804
I was happy there.

11:39.249 --> 11:40.872
I love that hospital.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.499
I lo... I love the staff
and the patients.

11:43.593 --> 11:47.273
It just...
felt like home.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.506
Here's a thought.

11:50.757 --> 11:53.155
What if
I come work with you?

11:53.645 --> 11:56.762
I saw your waiting room.
You need the help.

11:57.036 --> 11:58.284
We have
an office manager.

11:58.372 --> 12:00.553
She doesn't manage.
She's never there.

12:00.703 --> 12:02.177
I-I was a nurse.

12:02.265 --> 12:03.853
I could schedule
your appointments.

12:03.940 --> 12:06.739
I could, um,
triage the walk-ins.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.241
It's like a win-win.

12:08.329 --> 12:10.999
I don't think
we have the budget for...

12:11.260 --> 12:12.562
for new employees.

12:14.084 --> 12:17.700
Aaron, that's horse crap.

12:18.015 --> 12:19.851
You're the president.

12:20.370 --> 12:23.421
What's the real reason?

12:25.232 --> 12:29.192
I-I think couples that
are apart now and then,

12:29.280 --> 12:30.713
it's a good thing.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.835
Couples together 24/7?

12:33.554 --> 12:36.161
I mean, I don't want to get to
the point where we come home

12:36.249 --> 12:38.390
and we run to opposite
sides of the house.

12:41.452 --> 12:42.791
Okay.

12:43.042 --> 12:44.777
Just a thought.

12:46.002 --> 12:49.101
I'm just gonna...
Keep looking.

12:53.623 --> 12:55.109
Hi, Carly.

12:55.615 --> 12:56.984
Replacement vials.

12:57.187 --> 12:59.622
For some reason,
the bloodwork for Shaun's case

12:59.710 --> 13:01.124
was never processed.

13:01.219 --> 13:02.466
Oh, that doesn't
sound right.

13:02.554 --> 13:04.413
Why is not
all that important.

13:04.501 --> 13:06.249
But if you could just
put a rush on them.

13:06.336 --> 13:08.349
If the tests get delayed
any longer,

13:08.437 --> 13:10.866
then Shaun's surgery
could get rescheduled.

13:10.968 --> 13:12.489
There's no record
of any bloodwork

13:12.577 --> 13:14.818
- being dropped off for Shaun.
- If the surgery gets rescheduled,

13:14.905 --> 13:17.660
then Shaun will lose his team,
the team he's practiced with.

13:17.747 --> 13:19.595
It might throw him,
so if you could just...

13:19.682 --> 13:21.702
Shaun doesn't get thrown
by anything medical.

13:22.959 --> 13:24.874
Shaun is already thrown.

13:26.805 --> 13:28.341
For some reason,
he has it in his head

13:28.429 --> 13:30.586
that you dissed him or something,
that maybe there's a problem,

13:30.673 --> 13:32.922
and now he seems
distracted, upset.

13:33.010 --> 13:33.998
I...

13:34.086 --> 13:35.579
I wondered if you could
speak with him,

13:35.666 --> 13:37.119
let him know
everything's okay.

13:39.422 --> 13:42.041
I'll make sure to put a rush
on the blood tests.

13:43.140 --> 13:44.572
Thank you.

13:47.667 --> 13:50.346
My wife says
that the Earth is a womb

13:50.572 --> 13:51.961
and that when you garden,

13:52.048 --> 13:54.432
you become part
of its birthing process.

13:54.580 --> 13:56.492
Not that I mind
sharing hobbies with her.

13:56.580 --> 13:58.133
It keeps us close.

13:58.346 --> 14:00.916
And I don't mind
the dirt in my eyes.

14:01.498 --> 14:03.880
Just could do with
a little less of the talking.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.346
I feel you.

14:06.596 --> 14:09.812
You don't by any chance
possess the power of flight?

14:09.899 --> 14:11.189
Uh, what?

14:11.277 --> 14:13.192
You have a wing
in your eye.

14:13.280 --> 14:14.349
Sorry?

14:14.437 --> 14:15.783
Just hold still.

14:16.830 --> 14:18.288
Ow.

14:18.455 --> 14:21.697
Congratulations.
Your womb just gave birth to a bee.

14:21.791 --> 14:22.725
Ugh.

14:22.861 --> 14:24.658
Triplets, in fact.

14:24.746 --> 14:27.299
Dr. Glassman,
I need to compartmentalize.

14:27.486 --> 14:28.830
Hi, Shaun.

14:29.244 --> 14:30.300
Nurse Hawks says

14:30.387 --> 14:33.164
girlfriends invite their
boyfriends to get-togethers.

14:33.252 --> 14:35.838
That means it's possible
Carly did not invite me

14:35.925 --> 14:37.473
because I am not
her boyfriend,

14:37.560 --> 14:40.679
but we make out and she
wants to hold my hand

14:40.767 --> 14:43.064
and she lets me
touch her breasts.

14:43.205 --> 14:46.307
Those are things you do
with a boyfriend.

14:46.395 --> 14:48.176
Now all I think about
is Carly,

14:48.471 --> 14:51.354
even when I'm supposed
to be doing my job.

14:51.441 --> 14:52.617
I do not like it.

14:52.705 --> 14:54.861
I tried to talk to her,
but I can't.

14:55.015 --> 14:56.262
You can't talk to her?

14:56.350 --> 14:57.502
I can't.

14:57.590 --> 15:00.005
I need
to compartmentalize.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.320
Well, Shaun, you're...

15:01.408 --> 15:04.158
You're very good
at compartmentalizing.

15:04.332 --> 15:05.898
Were you wearing
your white lab coat

15:05.986 --> 15:07.150
when you tried
to talk to her?

15:07.238 --> 15:09.320
N-No, I was in
my surgical scrubs.

15:09.408 --> 15:12.133
Okay, see,
we all struggle to...

15:12.221 --> 15:15.781
to separate our work life
with our personal life, right?

15:15.869 --> 15:17.547
That's why
we wear uniforms.

15:17.634 --> 15:19.258
It tells us,
it tells the world,

15:19.346 --> 15:21.406
"This is what I have to
focus on right now.

15:21.494 --> 15:23.312
"I can't worry about
anything else."

15:23.400 --> 15:25.020
- That makes sense.
- Good.

15:25.107 --> 15:27.351
So, when Carly's wearing
her white lab coat,

15:27.439 --> 15:28.891
then she's
just a co-worker,

15:28.978 --> 15:31.844
not a girl you happen to
be seeing at the moment.

15:31.932 --> 15:33.812
When you're wearing
your white lab coat,

15:33.900 --> 15:36.799
then you say to yourself,
"I'm a doctor, damn it.

15:36.887 --> 15:39.017
"I'm not gonna worry
about everything else."

15:39.105 --> 15:40.834
Say to yourself,
"I'm a doctor.

15:40.990 --> 15:43.439
"Romance doesn't matter."

15:44.694 --> 15:46.299
I'm a doctor.

15:46.387 --> 15:47.701
Romance doesn't matter.

15:47.812 --> 15:49.378
I'm a doctor.
Romance doesn't matter.

15:49.466 --> 15:51.381
I am a doctor.

15:51.468 --> 15:53.517
Romance doesn't matter.

15:57.340 --> 16:00.054
I am a doctor.

16:00.142 --> 16:01.578
Romance doesn't matter.

16:04.714 --> 16:07.927
Um, you're wearing
a white lab coat.

16:08.084 --> 16:10.865
You want to be a doctor and get
the other bees out of my eye?

16:10.996 --> 16:12.670
You make a fair point.

16:14.667 --> 16:15.974
Looking for Murphy?

16:16.062 --> 16:17.172
Yep.

16:17.260 --> 16:19.341
- Blood tests being expedited?
- Yes.

16:19.443 --> 16:22.638
Did you own your mistake or
blame some innocent clerk?

16:23.933 --> 16:26.427
How did it feel?
Is it eating at you?

16:26.515 --> 16:28.371
You mean,
how do I live one moment

16:28.459 --> 16:30.404
behaving how you do
constantly?

16:30.640 --> 16:31.987
At least I'm consistent,

16:32.074 --> 16:34.318
even when I'm going through
my own issues.

16:36.287 --> 16:37.529
Shaun?

16:39.508 --> 16:40.975
Why aren't you wearing
your white coat?

16:41.062 --> 16:43.777
I am a civilian.

16:44.240 --> 16:45.801
Medicine doesn't matter.

16:46.060 --> 16:47.270
You're not leaving.

16:47.396 --> 16:49.248
Your surgery
is in six hours.

16:52.894 --> 16:54.876
Did you speak
to Carly?

16:54.964 --> 16:58.927
I need to talk
to Carly.

16:59.469 --> 17:02.638
Shaun, why did we practice
this morning?

17:02.805 --> 17:05.887
Because I'm not good
at communication.

17:05.976 --> 17:07.019
Exactly.

17:07.107 --> 17:08.873
But with practice,
you can do it.

17:09.531 --> 17:10.709
Talk to me.

17:10.797 --> 17:13.896
Tell me the problem.
Tell me how you feel.

17:15.391 --> 17:16.972
Okay.

17:17.153 --> 17:20.576
I have to talk
to Carly.

17:21.021 --> 17:22.404
Shaun, stop.

17:22.806 --> 17:25.422
You don't have to
talk to Carly.

17:25.510 --> 17:26.624
Everything is fine.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.012
I talked to her earlier,

17:28.154 --> 17:30.920
and it was just
all a misunderstanding.

17:32.278 --> 17:36.123
Why did she not invite me
over to meet her friends?

17:36.224 --> 17:37.443
There were no friends.

17:37.537 --> 17:38.721
Uh, the laughing
you heard,

17:38.808 --> 17:41.599
she thinks it must have been a
podcast she was listening to.

17:45.240 --> 17:47.404
I need to get my lab coat.

17:50.820 --> 17:53.099
Told you you're better
at this than I am.

17:53.544 --> 17:55.310
Though you could have
jumped in earlier.

17:58.582 --> 18:02.199
We were able to do a biopsy,
and the mass is non-malignant.

18:03.725 --> 18:06.464
We've stabilized it,
but it does still need to be removed.

18:06.569 --> 18:07.720
When?

18:07.808 --> 18:08.951
Two months.

18:09.038 --> 18:10.752
By then, the baby will
be viable outside the...

18:10.839 --> 18:12.167
I don't feel well.

18:13.118 --> 18:14.597
My vision's
getting blurry.

18:15.712 --> 18:17.059
Your blood pressure's
tanking.

18:17.146 --> 18:19.795
W... Doctor,
what's happening to her?

18:19.882 --> 18:21.667
Page Dr. Melendez.

18:39.116 --> 18:40.192
Hello.

18:40.280 --> 18:42.966
My name is Dr. Shaun Murphy,

18:43.146 --> 18:45.862
surgical resident year three.

18:46.019 --> 18:48.801
I will be assisted
by Dr. Claire Browne

18:48.913 --> 18:51.128
on today's
open appendectomy.

18:51.270 --> 18:54.740
I will not be putting on my
number 7 sterile gloves myself,

18:54.828 --> 18:56.941
as I am lead surgeon.

18:58.670 --> 19:03.042
Nurse Fletch,
can you adjust the overhead light?

19:04.218 --> 19:08.355
Adjust to
a 35-degree angle.

19:10.842 --> 19:13.730
Nurse Hawks,
please hand me the 10 blade.

19:26.713 --> 19:29.667
The arterial embolization was
rejected above the bladder.

19:29.755 --> 19:31.363
The mass
is seeping blood.

19:31.451 --> 19:33.910
We have to go in again,
or she'll slowly bleed to death.

19:34.085 --> 19:35.597
We deliver
the baby early,

19:35.685 --> 19:37.657
have an incubator and
ventilator ready in the O.R.

19:37.835 --> 19:39.461
Even with
maximal NICU support,

19:39.549 --> 19:42.866
the baby's chance of survival
is around 15% to 20%.

19:42.954 --> 19:44.985
Maybe we were wrong
the first time.

19:45.869 --> 19:48.852
Maybe we can leave the
child and work around her.

19:48.940 --> 19:51.326
We can suction-resect
this friable lesion

19:51.414 --> 19:54.247
and control the bleeding better
with the argon beam coagulator.

19:54.373 --> 19:56.876
Very easy to go too far,
cause a uterine rupture.

19:56.964 --> 19:57.983
But if we don't screw up,

19:58.071 --> 20:00.219
the baby gets to stay in
the womb and grow to term.

20:00.307 --> 20:01.446
Nice.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.615
I'll go book an O.R.

20:02.703 --> 20:03.735
Wait.

20:04.642 --> 20:06.430
There's one more thing
we need to do.

20:10.940 --> 20:12.407
It's a good plan.

20:12.749 --> 20:14.071
But the safest
course of action

20:14.159 --> 20:16.422
is to deliver prematurely
and remove the mass.

20:16.510 --> 20:18.399
By "deliver prematurely,"

20:18.573 --> 20:20.155
you mean
terminate the pregnancy.

20:20.279 --> 20:22.750
Not necessarily.
But yes.

20:22.923 --> 20:24.282
To save her life.

20:25.317 --> 20:28.039
If I place internal iliac
artery balloon catheters,

20:28.127 --> 20:30.250
I can control most bleeding
as it happens.

20:30.338 --> 20:31.606
Most?

20:33.560 --> 20:36.758
I've performed surgeries that
were a lot more complicated

20:36.846 --> 20:38.657
under much more difficult
circumstances.

20:38.748 --> 20:40.329
When you had
no other option.

20:40.417 --> 20:42.657
You have a choice here,
a safer choice.

20:42.745 --> 20:44.394
The mother's life
takes precedence.

20:44.482 --> 20:45.985
That's our policy.

20:46.203 --> 20:47.750
Are we sure it's hers?

20:51.130 --> 20:53.258
Okay.
Go make your case.

20:53.828 --> 20:55.383
Thank you.

20:55.694 --> 20:56.766
Neil?

20:58.023 --> 20:59.586
Thank you
for getting my approval.

21:00.815 --> 21:01.982
It's your job.

21:06.020 --> 21:08.735
I will now
use electrocautery

21:08.823 --> 21:12.086
to incise through
both the fascia and muscles.

21:13.322 --> 21:15.352
Can I please
get a measurement

21:15.440 --> 21:18.852
on the patient's pulse,
blood pressure, and temperature?

21:18.940 --> 21:22.368
Pulse is at 65,
pressure 118/82,

21:22.456 --> 21:24.704
and temp is normal,
at 98.6 degrees.

21:24.886 --> 21:27.856
Thank you for hearing
and responding.

21:28.991 --> 21:32.108
The appendix can be
removed in various ways.

21:32.344 --> 21:35.827
I will be using the
suture ligation technique.

21:35.915 --> 21:38.891
Dr. Browne,
can you identify the ascending colon

21:38.979 --> 21:40.514
and its taenia coli?

21:44.621 --> 21:45.602
I see it.

21:45.690 --> 21:46.745
Thank you.

21:46.833 --> 21:49.811
Please free the
appendix-mesoappendix complex

21:49.899 --> 21:51.063
from its adjacent tissue.

21:51.151 --> 21:52.829
Babcock clamps.

22:04.918 --> 22:07.579
We must have nicked an
ileocolic branch of the SMA.

22:12.100 --> 22:14.969
Get suction on it,
Dr. Browne.

22:15.321 --> 22:18.211
Nurse Fletch, please use
lap sponges to stem the bleed.

22:24.745 --> 22:26.627
If she hemorrhages,
she could die?

22:26.737 --> 22:28.204
That is a possibility.

22:28.387 --> 22:31.591
But if you're successful,
then I complete my pregnancy.

22:31.679 --> 22:33.260
No. It's too risky.

22:33.348 --> 22:35.704
If Dr. Melendez
says he can do it...

22:37.017 --> 22:38.618
Do the other surgery...

22:38.706 --> 22:40.866
The one where you take the
baby out and you save Patty.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.133
I'm the one
carrying the baby.

22:44.510 --> 22:46.133
I'm the one
going through the surgery.

22:46.221 --> 22:48.581
- It's not your choice to make.
- I-I didn't want this baby.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.875
Sorry. I...

22:56.711 --> 22:59.922
Look, we can have another
child some other time.

23:01.173 --> 23:03.063
But I can't replace you.

23:11.092 --> 23:13.336
I don't want
another baby.

23:14.531 --> 23:17.235
I want the one that's been
giving me morning sickness

23:17.323 --> 23:20.329
for the last 23 weeks.

23:20.656 --> 23:23.454
I want the one who's
been giving me heartburn,

23:23.542 --> 23:26.516
constipation,
and insomnia.

23:29.079 --> 23:31.063
That's the baby
that I want to hold.

23:33.716 --> 23:35.743
And I couldn't live
with the guilt

23:36.962 --> 23:39.899
if I killed our baby
to save my own life.

23:57.509 --> 24:02.547
Performing a suture ligation with
two interrupted 2-0 vicryl sutures.

24:17.419 --> 24:21.485
Dr. Browne,
cauterize the exposed mucosa.

24:22.662 --> 24:24.438
I may owe Dr. Lim
an apology.

24:26.905 --> 24:28.053
Continue.

24:28.140 --> 24:29.554
Uh, yes.

24:29.641 --> 24:32.924
We still need to
copiously irrigate the wound

24:33.011 --> 24:34.500
with normal saline,

24:34.605 --> 24:36.894
grasp the peritoneum
with two straight clamps,

24:36.982 --> 24:40.446
and close it all up with a
continuous 3-0 vicryl stitch.

24:42.120 --> 24:43.422
Irrigating.

24:44.329 --> 24:47.735
Straight clamp, please,
N-Nurse...

24:49.948 --> 24:53.336
Straight clamp, please,
Nurse Hawks.

24:57.769 --> 25:01.352
You are handing them
to me incorrectly.

25:01.485 --> 25:02.649
I'm sorry?

25:05.071 --> 25:08.157
You are handing them
to me incorrectly.

25:08.280 --> 25:09.977
This is how
I always do it.

25:10.065 --> 25:11.266
You do it wrong.

25:12.221 --> 25:14.799
Shaun...
I don't know how else to do it.

25:18.178 --> 25:20.118
You can do it
the right way.

25:20.206 --> 25:21.539
What's the right way?

25:21.626 --> 25:23.474
The efficient way.
Efficient?

25:23.561 --> 25:24.605
Yes.

25:24.693 --> 25:29.180
There is historical precedence
to my preference.

25:29.267 --> 25:30.548
Please just take
the clamp.

25:30.635 --> 25:32.317
I can't.
Of course you can.

25:32.404 --> 25:33.823
Take the damn clamp.

25:40.610 --> 25:41.845
You need to leave.

25:46.333 --> 25:48.260
Nurse Hawks...

25:49.128 --> 25:51.276
You need to leave the O.R.

25:52.290 --> 25:53.471
Leave now!

26:08.483 --> 26:10.654
Dr. Reznick,
please cauterize those bleeders

26:10.742 --> 26:12.120
with the argon coagulator.

26:14.167 --> 26:15.493
I nicked an artery.

26:15.580 --> 26:16.694
She's hemorrhaging!

26:16.781 --> 26:18.635
Hang four units
on the rapid infuser.

26:18.723 --> 26:20.135
Get me a vascular clamp.

26:21.691 --> 26:24.026
The surgery
was successful.

26:24.114 --> 26:26.263
The patient's vital
signs are stable...

26:26.378 --> 26:30.441
You can't solve your interpersonal
problems by making people go away.

26:30.528 --> 26:31.987
There was a bleed.

26:33.031 --> 26:35.280
You threw the nurse out of
surgery because of a bleed?

26:35.367 --> 26:36.547
Yes.

26:36.634 --> 26:39.985
Because we nicked the
ileocolic branch of the SMA,

26:40.072 --> 26:42.417
Nurse Fletch was attending
to the lap sponges,

26:42.505 --> 26:45.399
so Nurse Hawks had to hand
me the straight clamp,

26:45.487 --> 26:47.299
and she did it wrong.

26:48.441 --> 26:50.790
And she refused
to do it right.

26:51.065 --> 26:52.697
Did you tell her
how to do it right?

26:52.784 --> 26:55.866
I wanted
my straight clamp

26:55.953 --> 26:58.403
handed to me
at a 45-degree angle

26:58.490 --> 27:00.705
so I do not have to
bend my wrist as much

27:00.792 --> 27:02.907
to go from handoff
to the surgical field.

27:02.994 --> 27:04.642
Did you explain
all of that to her?

27:04.729 --> 27:08.862
I told her to do it
the efficient way.

27:11.945 --> 27:15.327
I want you to apologize
to Nurse Hawks.

27:15.415 --> 27:16.563
N-No. No.

27:16.651 --> 27:21.602
Why would I apologize because
she did not do it right?

27:21.690 --> 27:24.635
Because you didn't,
either.

27:25.825 --> 27:28.498
When you're lead surgeon,
it means you're in charge,

27:28.586 --> 27:31.669
which means if anything goes
wrong, it's your fault.

27:31.807 --> 27:33.253
Do you understand?

27:35.208 --> 27:36.753
You've gotta
make this right.

27:39.693 --> 27:40.893
Okay.

27:47.328 --> 27:51.237
You could have stepped in and kept
the situation from escalating.

27:55.456 --> 27:57.940
You have your way
of dealing with Shaun,

27:58.750 --> 28:00.252
and so do I.

28:08.362 --> 28:09.467
We need better control of

28:09.555 --> 28:11.092
the bleeding.
Clamp off the common iliac.

28:11.180 --> 28:12.760
There's too much
blood to see in here.

28:12.848 --> 28:14.784
We have to
take the baby out.

28:19.441 --> 28:21.034
Page the on-call
neonatologist.

28:21.122 --> 28:22.738
Let them know they're gonna
have a 23-week-old girl

28:22.825 --> 28:24.193
coming their way
very soon.

28:28.291 --> 28:31.971
Second time in as many days
you've dropped by unexpectedly.

28:32.059 --> 28:33.307
I'm starting to think
you like me.

28:33.394 --> 28:35.370
I got a job offer.

28:35.458 --> 28:37.167
Well, there you go.
That was quick.

28:37.255 --> 28:38.302
Let's go celebrate.

28:38.433 --> 28:39.882
Well, I'm not gonna
take the offer.

28:39.970 --> 28:42.118
I want to come
work here with you.

28:42.206 --> 28:44.054
Well, we've already
talked about that.

28:44.142 --> 28:46.157
You talked.
I listened.

28:46.404 --> 28:47.906
Now it's my turn
to talk.

28:48.570 --> 28:50.807
We got married
to be here for each other,

28:51.083 --> 28:54.151
even when the other one
didn't know they need it.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.034
You're so busy
with your patients,

28:56.122 --> 28:58.174
you don't see that the clinic
is starting to suffer.

28:58.262 --> 29:00.588
Right now,
it's double-booked appointments.

29:00.706 --> 29:03.362
Next, it could be the wrong
medication prescribed.

29:03.450 --> 29:04.878
I would never
let that happen.

29:04.966 --> 29:06.147
I'm a good partner.

29:06.235 --> 29:09.338
I'm good at home,
on the weekends.

29:09.426 --> 29:13.378
I could be equally as good
here in this office.

29:14.458 --> 29:17.463
Okay, if it doesn't
work out, I'll quit.

29:18.485 --> 29:20.003
Or you can fire me.

29:20.259 --> 29:21.674
No harm, no foul.

29:21.762 --> 29:25.167
Uh, nothing is ever as simple
as "No harm, no foul."

29:26.858 --> 29:28.026
Got a resume?

29:28.810 --> 29:33.588
Well, I was hoping
to avoid that.

29:52.818 --> 29:53.919
Mm.

30:08.262 --> 30:12.322
I read a study that said sharing
a cup of coffee with colleagues

30:12.410 --> 30:14.111
promotes professionalism.

30:14.484 --> 30:15.899
My cup is empty

30:15.987 --> 30:18.673
because I do not like the
way coffee makes me feel.

30:20.132 --> 30:23.749
I've had a long day.
Can I just enjoy my lunch?

30:24.117 --> 30:27.920
Chief Lim asked me
to apologize to you.

30:29.444 --> 30:30.512
Okay.

30:32.766 --> 30:33.767
Okay.

30:42.146 --> 30:44.650
The earliest
known drawing

30:44.790 --> 30:47.213
of a pivoting
surgical instrument

30:47.301 --> 30:51.595
dates back to 1500 B.C.
on a tomb at Thebes, Egypt...

30:51.683 --> 30:53.825
This does not sound like
the beginning of an apology.

30:53.913 --> 30:56.572
I want to explain why
I prefer the straight clamp

30:56.660 --> 30:59.197
handed to me
at a 45-degree angle.

30:59.285 --> 31:01.494
Putting it in historical
context will help.

31:01.582 --> 31:02.509
You need to stop.

31:02.597 --> 31:03.879
In the ninth century,

31:03.967 --> 31:06.908
Albucasis, known as
"the father of surgery"...

31:06.996 --> 31:08.559
You need to go away.

31:08.647 --> 31:09.712
No.

31:09.800 --> 31:11.783
I need you to understand

31:11.871 --> 31:13.650
because if you see
why I'm right,

31:13.738 --> 31:16.689
you will see there is no
reason for me to apologize.

31:28.601 --> 31:30.139
She's gone into
unstable v-tach.

31:30.227 --> 31:32.501
Dr. Reznick,
we're gonna need the defibrillator.

31:38.916 --> 31:40.642
Charging.

31:41.085 --> 31:42.266
Clear.

31:44.066 --> 31:45.280
Continue compressions.

31:45.368 --> 31:47.070
Give me one milligram
of epinephrine.

31:47.165 --> 31:49.720
She's gone into v-fib.
Shock again.

31:49.808 --> 31:51.189
Charging.

31:51.397 --> 31:52.664
Clear.

31:54.802 --> 31:57.431
All right, crack her chest.
I'm gonna do an open-heart massage.

32:05.679 --> 32:06.980
Heart's exposed.

32:08.516 --> 32:09.923
Starting the massage.

32:13.677 --> 32:14.946
Internal cardiac paddles.

32:19.036 --> 32:21.626
Charging.

32:21.912 --> 32:23.345
Clear.

32:25.785 --> 32:26.923
Again.

32:27.063 --> 32:28.751
Charge. Clear.

32:30.708 --> 32:32.256
Again!

32:32.655 --> 32:34.361
Charge.

32:34.495 --> 32:35.594
Clear.

33:01.250 --> 33:03.087
Let's open the uterus
and get the baby.

33:17.482 --> 33:19.363
All you had to do
was say you're sorry.

33:19.528 --> 33:24.142
I... tried to explain
why the straight clamp...

33:24.230 --> 33:26.046
N-No, I-I don't hear
the word "sorry" in there.

33:26.133 --> 33:28.275
I-I don't hear any
taking of responsibility.

33:28.363 --> 33:32.665
You said
I had to make this right.

33:32.753 --> 33:35.548
An apology seemed to be
just one possible way...

33:35.636 --> 33:37.718
Shaun,
she filed a complaint.

33:37.821 --> 33:39.900
No. No!
Yes. Yes.

33:39.988 --> 33:42.307
- You have a problem with communication.
- I was... Yes, but I am...

33:42.394 --> 33:44.579
So I'm going to make this
very, very clear.

33:44.667 --> 33:46.181
You screwed up.

33:46.269 --> 33:47.970
- No. No!
- Yes. Yeah, you were wrong.

33:48.058 --> 33:50.111
You are wrong.
You screwed up.

33:50.533 --> 33:52.892
This incident will be
noted in your file.

33:53.103 --> 33:56.556
And if this or anything
like this happens again,

33:56.644 --> 33:59.503
that will be the end
of your residency.

34:02.515 --> 34:04.572
Now, what do you
have to say?

34:12.088 --> 34:13.634
You're sorry?

34:16.636 --> 34:18.337
I failed.

34:22.241 --> 34:23.636
I'm sorry.

34:24.797 --> 34:26.083
Good.

34:26.973 --> 34:29.443
Now go say those words
to Nurse Hawks.

34:29.922 --> 34:31.091
And mean them.

34:57.934 --> 34:59.380
I spoke to Carly.

34:59.742 --> 35:01.880
You're a terrible
fairy godmother.

35:01.968 --> 35:04.294
You swoop in, you enchant
the hero with a lie,

35:04.382 --> 35:06.833
and then you carry on like you
made his world a better place.

35:06.921 --> 35:08.763
Shaun was about to
talk to Carly.

35:08.851 --> 35:10.132
That's what
he needed to do.

35:10.220 --> 35:11.509
I think
Carly's pissed at him.

35:11.597 --> 35:14.046
Fine. Then she's pissed at him.
They deal with it.

35:14.220 --> 35:16.470
Shaun's problem
is communication.

35:16.558 --> 35:17.696
You made it worse.

35:17.784 --> 35:19.360
Shaun needed
to get his head straight

35:19.448 --> 35:21.220
before his first
solo surgery.

35:21.308 --> 35:24.134
That is what I did.
I fixed the problem.

35:24.324 --> 35:26.470
You buried a problem.

35:27.473 --> 35:30.375
Which seems to be your general
approach to life right now.

37:40.467 --> 37:41.582
Hey, Shaun.

37:42.069 --> 37:43.070
Hello.

37:44.365 --> 37:45.967
We need to talk.

37:53.982 --> 37:56.683
You're mad at me.

37:57.082 --> 37:58.083
Yes.

37:58.590 --> 38:00.572
Because whenever
you have a problem,

38:00.660 --> 38:04.709
I hear it from Glassman
or Claire or Morgan...

38:05.130 --> 38:06.436
Anyone but you.

38:13.925 --> 38:15.436
I'm sorry.

38:16.274 --> 38:17.441
Good.

38:21.114 --> 38:22.819
Shaun, stop!

38:24.043 --> 38:25.625
This is the problem.

38:25.806 --> 38:28.350
You have to tell me
what's bothering you.

38:33.911 --> 38:37.171
Why did you not invite me 
to your get-together last Sunday?

38:38.276 --> 38:40.686
I had
some old friends over.

38:40.906 --> 38:43.678
We were gonna drink
and play a little poker.

38:44.350 --> 38:46.465
My friends are snarky.

38:46.787 --> 38:50.741
They tease and play practical
jokes on each other.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.477
And I knew
that you wouldn't like that

38:52.671 --> 38:53.858
and that
it would get weird,

38:53.946 --> 38:56.374
so I decided
not to invite you.

38:57.788 --> 38:58.935
That's it.

38:59.162 --> 39:00.561
The whole story.

39:06.476 --> 39:11.171
My father
always sent me to my room

39:11.320 --> 39:14.272
when he would play poker
with his friends.

39:14.954 --> 39:18.647
They were loud,
and they would tease me.

39:19.487 --> 39:20.935
They said I talked funny.

39:21.023 --> 39:23.397
Is that what your friends
were going to say?

39:23.700 --> 39:25.192
No, Shaun.
Of course not.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.501
Then what were they
going to do?

39:29.462 --> 39:31.366
Nothing, I guess.

39:32.294 --> 39:33.542
It's just...

39:33.661 --> 39:35.811
Sometimes when you bring
the guy that you're dating

39:35.899 --> 39:38.327
into the mix,
that relationship changes.

39:38.601 --> 39:40.383
It can be a disaster.

39:40.783 --> 39:43.163
Was it a disaster

39:43.891 --> 39:47.874
every time you brought a date
to meet your friends?

39:49.163 --> 39:51.374
No.
Some fit right in.

39:51.476 --> 39:53.358
Then how did you know?

39:55.923 --> 40:00.843
How did you know it would
be a disaster with me?

40:06.311 --> 40:07.546
I didn't.

40:09.986 --> 40:11.757
I made an assumption.

40:12.154 --> 40:13.897
And I shouldn't
have done that.

40:16.431 --> 40:17.983
I'm sorry, too.

40:23.330 --> 40:24.819
Can you forgive me?

40:28.322 --> 40:30.397
I wasn't
a great girlfriend.

40:33.032 --> 40:34.233
Girlfriend?

40:37.738 --> 40:40.108
You're my girlfriend?

40:40.196 --> 40:41.330
Yeah.

40:42.523 --> 40:45.006
Does that mean
I'm your boyfriend?

40:45.289 --> 40:46.303
You are.

40:46.546 --> 40:48.348
I forgive you.

40:56.369 --> 40:57.383
Can I kiss you?

40:57.471 --> 40:58.572
Okay.

41:10.077 --> 41:11.592
I'm glad we talked.

41:11.680 --> 41:13.428
Me too.

41:13.929 --> 41:16.342
I'll introduce you
to my friends next week.

41:16.507 --> 41:17.748
No, thank you.

41:17.851 --> 41:19.998
I would not like
to meet your friends.

41:23.206 --> 41:24.764
- Okay.
- Okay.
