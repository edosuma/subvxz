06:55.983 --> 06:58.083
Everyone, check your email.

00:04.372 --> 00:06.372
The greatest thing that could
ever happen has just happened.

00:06.374 --> 00:08.474
The girl who beat you for
high school valedictorian died?

00:08.476 --> 00:11.176
No, "Kevin Cozner
requests your presence

00:11.178 --> 00:13.178
At Raymond's birthday party."

00:13.180 --> 00:14.680
Who's Kevin Cozner?

00:14.682 --> 00:17.483
Is he the star
of "Danzes with Wolvez?"

00:17.485 --> 00:20.085
He's captain Holt's husband.
Captain Raymond Holt.

00:20.087 --> 00:21.420
We're invited
to the captain's birthday party.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.689
Oh, the captain's party
and whatnot.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.125
I can't wait to see the inside
of Raymond's house.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.093
I'm gonna learn everything
there is to know about him.

00:28.095 --> 00:31.797
I bet it's really fancy,
like beauty and the beast fancy.

00:31.799 --> 00:34.133
No, it's probably just
an empty, white cube

00:34.135 --> 00:35.634
With a usb port in it
for him to plug his finger in

00:35.636 --> 00:37.369
When he's on sleep mode.

00:37.371 --> 00:40.606
Apparently, my husband Kevin
has invited you all to my party.

00:40.608 --> 00:42.307
There is very little
street parking, no gifts,

00:42.309 --> 00:45.611
No singing of happy birthday.
Should be fun.

00:45.613 --> 00:48.113
Sounds fantastic.

00:48.115 --> 00:52.117
Did you hear that?
His husband invited us, not him.

00:52.119 --> 00:53.118
He so doesn't want us there.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.520
Yes, he does.

00:54.522 --> 00:57.356
Mm, it was kind of
a last-minute invite.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.091
Just stirring the pot.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.392
Why wouldn't Holt
want us there?

01:00.394 --> 01:02.194
Because he thinks
we're going to embarrass him

01:02.196 --> 01:05.330
In front of his husband,
which, frankly, is insulting!

01:05.331 --> 01:07.199
Oh, man.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.401
All the orange soda
spilled out of my cereal.

01:30.791 --> 01:33.225
Happy birthday,
you sly, old fox.

01:33.227 --> 01:34.860
How many spankings is it
this year?

01:34.862 --> 01:37.396
Peralta, please.
Save some charm for the party.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.798
Oh, you mean the party that you
begrudgingly invited us to

01:39.800 --> 01:41.633
At the last minute
'cause you don't want us there?

01:41.635 --> 01:43.202
I couldn't be happier
you're coming.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.104
And it shows.
I can't wait to meet Kevin.

01:45.106 --> 01:47.172
I assume he's the fun one
in the relationship.

01:47.174 --> 01:49.508
I'm not sure you and Kevin
will get along.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.443
Really?
Well, I disagree.

01:51.445 --> 01:54.179
In fact, I will guarantee you
that by the end of the night,

01:54.181 --> 01:56.215
Kev and I will be
best friends.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.516
He hates being called "Kev."

01:57.518 --> 02:00.219
Or does he?
Yes.

02:00.221 --> 02:02.154
Bam!

02:02.156 --> 02:04.623
Behold, my secret weapon
for winning over Kevin.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.792
In this box
is every grisly crime

02:06.794 --> 02:08.860
The nine-nine has worked
in the past eight years.

02:08.863 --> 02:11.363
Civilians love
juicy cop stories.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.198
Oh, I call that murder
where they strung

02:13.200 --> 02:14.500
Fishing wire
through three guys.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.135
Hey, we solved that
together.

02:16.137 --> 02:17.836
Well, tough tetris.
I called it.

02:17.838 --> 02:20.639
Also, I've loaded all of my
favorite karaoke backing tracks

02:20.641 --> 02:22.307
Onto my phone.

02:22.309 --> 02:24.510
Kevin and I will be duetting
rolling in the deep!

02:24.512 --> 02:26.512
That's it,
emergency squad meeting,

02:26.514 --> 02:28.347
Briefing room,
two minutes.

02:30.783 --> 02:32.351
Uh, adult parties?

02:32.353 --> 02:34.686
Sergeant, I believe
they're called orgies.

02:34.688 --> 02:35.921
No-look five.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.656
I met my wife at an orgy.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.858
Well,
she was leaving an orgy,

02:39.860 --> 02:41.927
And we bumped into each other
on the street.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.629
Real meet-cute.

02:43.631 --> 02:47.299
Thank you for exhibiting exactly
why this meeting is necessary.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.934
Everyone here
needs some instruction

02:48.936 --> 02:51.270
On interacting
with grown-ups.

02:51.272 --> 02:52.671
Sergeant,
why am I here?

02:52.673 --> 02:54.439
I'm always
incredibly appropriate.

02:54.441 --> 02:56.808
In high school, I was voted
"most appropriate."

02:56.810 --> 02:59.378
Ooh, self burn.
Those are rare.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.880
I shouldn't be here either.
I'm fine at parties.

03:01.882 --> 03:04.383
I just stand in the middle of
the room and don't say anything.

03:04.385 --> 03:06.418
Here are the rules:
No staring at your phones,

03:06.420 --> 03:08.220
No rolling in
two hours late.

03:08.222 --> 03:11.290
No sweatpants, no jeans,
and no shorts.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.658
What about dress-up shorts?

03:12.660 --> 03:14.526
For instance, the kind
jen aniston might wear?

03:14.528 --> 03:18.597
No, those are still shorts.
No shorts.

03:18.599 --> 03:19.965
And everyone bring
a bottle of wine.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.700
Why are there so many rules?
I mean, next thing

03:21.702 --> 03:23.502
You're gonna say is
we can't be late.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.404
Yeah, that's, like,
the first thing I said.

03:25.406 --> 03:28.307
Ohh.

03:29.442 --> 03:30.742
This neighborhood's amazing.

03:30.744 --> 03:33.512
Class just seeps
outta every vestibule.

03:33.514 --> 03:36.315
Keep it in your pants,
Santiago.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.450
Scully, I specifically said,
"no shorts."

03:38.452 --> 03:39.985
Sarge, it's not my fault.

03:39.987 --> 03:42.554
You said so many things
about shorts, I got confused.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.256
Man, did I screw the pooch.

03:44.258 --> 03:45.257
Oh.
Peralta,

03:45.259 --> 03:46.592
Where have you been?

03:46.594 --> 03:47.960
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I know,

03:47.962 --> 03:51.230
I am threety-five minutes late.
Yikes!

03:51.232 --> 03:52.998
But I had to stop
and get some wine.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.002
Hello, good sir, I'd like your
finest bottle of wine, please.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.605
That will be $1,600.

03:59.607 --> 04:02.808
Great, I'd like your $8-est
bottle of wine, please.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.978
It's from the finest vineyard
in arkansas.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.848
Ah, samesies!

04:13.254 --> 04:14.453
Wow.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.421
Wow.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.755
Ah, welcome.

04:17.757 --> 04:18.757
Captain.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.425
Raymond!

04:20.427 --> 04:22.594
Those slacks
are a knockout.

04:22.596 --> 04:23.929
Come on, amy.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.597
I trust you found my home
easy to locate,

04:25.599 --> 04:27.432
And thank you all for wearing
appropriate footwear.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.301
Wow, you really
let your hair down

04:29.303 --> 04:30.569
When you're not
at the office.

04:30.571 --> 04:33.038
Ah, detectives,
meet my husband, Kevin.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.473
Nice to meet you.
Hi.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.675
Evening, so glad
you could make it.

04:36.677 --> 04:39.745
Ah, and look,
he brought us some wine.

04:39.747 --> 04:42.314
"drink." this is legally
called "wine drink."

04:42.316 --> 04:44.616
Hmm, how very thoughtful.
Thank you.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.918
It's red.
Like blood.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.053
You know, I worked
a double homicide

04:48.055 --> 04:49.454
On this block
a couple years ago.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.323
The details
will astound you.

04:51.325 --> 04:52.424
Yes, I am sorry.

04:52.426 --> 04:53.592
Perhaps Raymond
didn't say anything.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.627
Our home has
a "no shoptalk" policy.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.962
I don't bring home beowulf,

04:56.964 --> 04:58.297
And he doesn't bring home
cop stories.

04:58.299 --> 05:00.532
Ah.
So may I pour you

05:00.534 --> 05:02.901
Some of this wine drink
you brought us?

05:02.903 --> 05:04.836
Perhaps all of it?

05:04.838 --> 05:07.372
All of it sounds good.

05:08.508 --> 05:09.975
Actually, ray and I met
over the phone.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.410
Oh, they've all heard
the story.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.312
No, we haven't,
and we need to.

05:13.314 --> 05:15.480
Well, ray was a source
for an article I was writing

05:15.482 --> 05:16.648
For The New Yorker.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.350
I asked him a series
of dry questions

05:18.352 --> 05:20.986
About police work, and
his answers had me in stitches.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.321
There's no one funnier
than ray Holt.

05:22.323 --> 05:23.822
Amen.
There isn't?

05:23.824 --> 05:25.057
We met for a drink that night,

05:25.059 --> 05:26.058
And we've been together
ever since.

05:26.060 --> 05:27.693
Yeah.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.761
So, Kevin, I hear you're
a professor at columbia?

05:29.763 --> 05:31.663
That's right, yes.
I head the classics department.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.598
Ah, interesting,
classics.

05:33.600 --> 05:38.937
Zeppelin, Hendrix, Die Hard.
Total classics head over here.

05:38.939 --> 05:42.107
I'm joking, obviously.
I know what the classics are.

05:42.109 --> 05:45.410
The odyssey and...The one
you said when we got here,

05:45.412 --> 05:47.346
The wolf one.

05:47.348 --> 05:48.714
Kevin, why don't we go mingle

05:48.716 --> 05:51.383
And let the detectives
settle in?

05:52.852 --> 05:54.753
Boyle, what happened
to your shirt?

05:54.755 --> 05:56.722
I spilled
a wonderful winter salsa.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.757
Here, wear my shirt.
I was gonna take it off anyway.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.125
Hitchcock, no!

06:00.127 --> 06:02.361
Boyle, take my sweater.

06:03.963 --> 06:06.565
Fits really well.
We have similar physiques.

06:06.567 --> 06:07.966
We've been here
all of four minutes,

06:07.968 --> 06:10.969
And you guys have already
forgotten everything I said!

06:10.971 --> 06:13.038
Party huddle, stat!

06:13.040 --> 06:15.774
Okay, gang,
we need a new strategy.

06:15.776 --> 06:17.776
Totally.
What is going on out there?

06:17.778 --> 06:20.112
We can't tell cop stories,
Kevin doesn't find me charming,

06:20.114 --> 06:22.147
And a native english speaker
referred to captain Holt

06:22.149 --> 06:24.750
As "hilarious."
I am flummoxed!

06:24.752 --> 06:27.085
That's a word I learned
for this party, and I am it!

06:27.087 --> 06:29.154
Well, I'm doing fine.
Really?

06:29.156 --> 06:31.056
"Raymond, those slacks
are a knockout."

06:31.058 --> 06:32.557
do you think he heard that?

06:32.559 --> 06:33.592
Only 'cause you yelled it.

06:33.594 --> 06:34.893
Shut up.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.895
From now on,
we play to our strengths.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.764
Charles, you know everything
about food.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.098
That's all you talk about.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.135
Will ever know everything
about food.

06:43.137 --> 06:44.603
It's an evolving discipline.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.004
That's great stuff.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.073
It's so boring.
Don't waste it.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.741
Amy, you studied art history.

06:49.743 --> 06:50.942
That's interesting.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.744
Scully, opera.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.981
Hitchcock, nothing.
Talk about nothing.

06:55.983 --> 06:58.083
Rosa, stick with Gina.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.851
Make sure she doesn't say
anything insane

06:59.853 --> 07:00.852
Or steal anything.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.721
Too late.

07:02.723 --> 07:05.690
Don't worry, it's just, like,
hats and scarves and stuff.

07:05.692 --> 07:07.993
She will put those back.
I will handle the chitchat.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.561
Well, that just leaves you,
Peralta.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.730
What's your cultural specialty?

07:11.732 --> 07:13.131
Easy, Kevin mentioned
The New Yorker,

07:13.133 --> 07:15.066
And I've totally
read that.

07:19.072 --> 07:22.707
Keep a low profile,
chuckle at anecdotes.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.209
Try not to start
any conversations.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.877
Got it.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.146
Wait a minute,
you're Hitchcocking me?

07:28.148 --> 07:30.549
Well, not surprising.
We're practically twins.

07:30.551 --> 07:33.485
"be appropriate," on three.
Quietly.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.487
One, two, three.

07:35.489 --> 07:37.989
Be appropriate.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.691
Now, break it up.
We look weird.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.860
Okay.

07:44.997 --> 07:48.033
Don't move as a group.
You're not gazelles.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.907
No, no,
I said, "millimeters."

07:58.679 --> 08:01.646
Oh, Ray, I'm gonna choke
from laughter.

08:01.648 --> 08:02.814
You're too funny!

08:04.151 --> 08:07.752
Yes, great humor words,
Raymond.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.821
You know, it reminds me
of a very interesting article

08:09.823 --> 08:11.857
I read about human trafficking
in The New Yorker.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.024
No, it doesn't.
Oh.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.726
The one written
by David Remnick.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.595
I loved that piece,
from four weeks ago.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.130
Or was it three weeks?
No, four.

08:19.132 --> 08:21.533
Anyways, I was riveted.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.702
I'm a huge New Yorker guy.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.670
I could talk
about that article for hours.

08:25.672 --> 08:26.838
Great.
That's unnecessary.

08:26.840 --> 08:27.839
Let's do that right now.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.574
Let's do.

08:29.576 --> 08:32.010
Ah, there they are.
Kevin, let's greet our guests.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.246
Oh. Mm-hmm.
Duty calls.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.948
To be continued.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.918
Totes!
Can't wait!

08:39.919 --> 08:41.653
I can wait.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.121
All I remember
about that article is the title.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.956
I was hopped up
on nitrous.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.658
Well, we gotta find
that magazine.

08:46.660 --> 08:47.826
It's gotta be in here
somewhere, right?

08:47.828 --> 08:50.128
This place is like
a candy store for nerds.

08:50.130 --> 08:53.698
Stop eating crab wrong!

08:55.301 --> 08:58.970
Ah, pepper relish
on your arancini.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.972
Very playful.
Cut through the richness,

09:00.974 --> 09:02.974
Add a little levity.
I love that.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.809
You really know your food.

09:04.811 --> 09:05.844
Well, you could say
it's the only thing

09:05.846 --> 09:07.045
I'm allowed to talk about.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.581
I'm Charles.
I work with captain Holt.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.584
I'm vivian ludley.
I work with Kevin.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.753
No.
The vivian ludley?

09:14.755 --> 09:16.821
Author of stone fruits
and stone-stones:

09:16.823 --> 09:19.891
Food of the paleolithic era?
I'm a huge fan!

09:19.893 --> 09:22.193
It's got the best recipes
for making salads out of moss.

09:22.195 --> 09:26.598
The trick is, you have
to lean into the dirt taste.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.800
Aha.
Mm-hmm.

09:28.802 --> 09:33.204
Chickpeas, tahini,
smoked paprika...

09:33.206 --> 09:35.040
They make their own hummus.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.741
Santiago?

09:36.743 --> 09:37.742
Sergeant!

09:37.744 --> 09:39.311
I'm learning so much.

09:39.313 --> 09:42.581
We both have blue hand towels,
we have the same microwave,

09:42.583 --> 09:45.216
And once I buy coasters
made out of geodes,

09:45.218 --> 09:46.217
We'll both have those.

09:46.219 --> 09:47.953
Yeah.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.322
No, hey!
My notes!

09:50.324 --> 09:53.124
This is a birthday party,
not a recon mission.

09:53.126 --> 09:56.261
You can get this back
at the end of the night.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.929
All right.

09:57.931 --> 09:58.897
Let's go interact
with these dummies.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.298
Wait here.

10:02.201 --> 10:03.802
What do you teach?

10:03.804 --> 10:04.970
Comparative historiography

10:04.972 --> 10:06.771
Of the French
and American revolutions.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.206
Nope.
How 'bout you?

10:08.208 --> 10:09.908
Molecular biology.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.810
Worse.
What do you study?

10:11.812 --> 10:13.612
Abnormal psychology.

10:13.614 --> 10:16.381
So, like,
weirdos and freaks.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.849
You should meet my friend.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.652
Hey.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.387
Gina, what are you
thinking about right now?

10:22.389 --> 10:26.625
I was thinking how I would make
the perfect american president,

10:26.627 --> 10:31.296
Based upon my skill set,
dance ability, and bloodlust.

10:31.298 --> 10:34.766
That is fascinating.

10:35.902 --> 10:38.036
"ah-shan-ti."

10:42.775 --> 10:46.945
Oh, man, it's black Tom Selleck
and white Sidney Poitier.

10:46.947 --> 10:49.914
Come on.

10:49.916 --> 10:51.683
All books and no magazines?

10:51.685 --> 10:54.786
What kind of crappy library's
full of books?

10:54.788 --> 10:56.921
A crap library.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.657
All of the magazines
are in the bathroom.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.225
Great solve, Peralta.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.292
Ah!

11:01.294 --> 11:02.694
Can I help you?

11:02.696 --> 11:03.962
Captain.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.031
I didn't hear you
silently sneak up on me.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.900
Oh, that reminds me, tell Kevin
that I am available for brunch

11:08.902 --> 11:09.901
On Sunday the 17th.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.870
The 17th is a Tuesday.

11:11.872 --> 11:14.906
Why are you talking about
The New Yorker all of a sudden?

11:14.908 --> 11:16.675
I always talk
about smart stuff.

11:16.677 --> 11:19.310
You know, the jazz age,
what's in a name,

11:19.312 --> 11:22.781
The 1950s movies
that are from the '50s.

11:22.783 --> 11:25.884
Those were the categories
on Jeopardy last night.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.352
Don't try so hard
to impress my husband.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.421
Yes, sir.

11:31.824 --> 11:33.958
To the crap library.

11:33.960 --> 11:37.862
April 13th, May 2nd...

11:37.864 --> 11:40.799
Come on! Why doesn't my life
always work out perfectly?

11:42.202 --> 11:45.303
Uh, just a second!
I'm halfway done!

11:45.305 --> 11:47.839
I'm halfway there,
I'm halfway done...

11:47.841 --> 11:51.142
With what's happening
in here.
Okay.

11:51.144 --> 11:56.047
♪ una furtiva lagrima ♪

11:56.049 --> 11:57.982
This song gets to me
every time.

11:57.984 --> 12:00.452
It's beautiful.
You must be so proud.

12:00.454 --> 12:01.820
I sure am.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.388
How long have you two
been together?

12:03.390 --> 12:05.356
We've been partners
for almost 30 years.

12:05.358 --> 12:08.026
So do you two ever
get harassed at work?

12:08.028 --> 12:10.061
Harassed?
For what?

12:10.063 --> 12:13.198
For being a gay couple
who works together in the nypd.

12:13.200 --> 12:17.035
Bu-u-u-ooh...

12:17.037 --> 12:19.904
Peralta.
Hey, don't you one-minute me.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.040
I will break that finger off.
Hang up that phone.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.875
I'm talking
to my credit card company.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.810
I tried to get an online
subscription to The New Yorker,

12:25.812 --> 12:27.112
And they declined me.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.047
Apparently,
based on my previous purchases,

12:29.049 --> 12:30.415
They assumed it was fraud.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.217
That's crazy.
I'm fancy.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.919
One time, I had
coffee-flavored ice cream.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.087
Shut up!
Okay.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.989
Hang up now.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.991
If you're that desperate,
the first two paragraphs

12:39.993 --> 12:41.459
Of the article
are on the free site.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.261
Hmm.
You have one minute
to look it up,

12:43.263 --> 12:46.898
And then if I catch you
on that phone again...

12:46.900 --> 12:48.867
Oh, my.
Don't worry.

12:48.869 --> 12:52.403
I'm due for an upgrade,
and my babies are on the cloud.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.007
He is so strong.

12:58.144 --> 12:59.377
Ah, thank you.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.879
Lovely party, Kevin.

13:00.881 --> 13:03.548
These tiny pickles
are hilarious.

13:03.550 --> 13:07.252
They're called cornichon.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.487
So that New Yorker article
about human trafficking

13:09.489 --> 13:11.156
We were discussing--
yes, so interesting,

13:11.158 --> 13:13.458
Especially
the first two paragraphs.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.293
Right, but what did you think
of the thesis,

13:15.295 --> 13:18.429
Vis-a-vis modern slavery and its
undeniable role in the economy?

13:18.431 --> 13:20.398
Good.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.001
If you ask me, the whole thesis
was way off base,

13:23.003 --> 13:24.803
Vis-a-vis
the rest of the article

13:24.805 --> 13:28.339
Vis-a-vis...America.

13:29.408 --> 13:31.242
The article
was antislavery.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.044
Are you saying
that slavery is good?

13:33.046 --> 13:34.479
You know, I think you're missing
the point of the article.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.980
You must not be
remembering it right.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.949
Well, I just read it
last night as I got in bed.

13:37.951 --> 13:38.950
It's quite fresh
in my memory.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.819
Ah.
You know,

13:40.821 --> 13:42.554
I would like to hear
more of your thoughts.

13:42.556 --> 13:44.355
And I would love
to give them to you,

13:44.357 --> 13:46.591
But unfortunately, I have
got to hit the crap library.

13:46.593 --> 13:49.394
Excuse me one second.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.896
My last meal on earth?
Mm.

13:51.898 --> 13:53.298
That's a great question.

13:53.300 --> 13:56.568
I'd go classic french.
Ortolan.

13:56.570 --> 13:59.304
Tiny songbird,
eaten in a single bite,

13:59.306 --> 14:01.840
Bones and all
in open defiance of god.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.608
It's illegal
to consume ortolan,

14:03.610 --> 14:07.212
But I actually got academic
dispensation to eat one once.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.514
Ohh.
The beak, very crunchy.

14:09.516 --> 14:13.484
That is literally the sexiest
thing anyone has ever said.

14:13.486 --> 14:14.953
How are you single?

14:14.955 --> 14:18.389
You're not seeing anyone?

14:20.492 --> 14:23.928
No.
There is nobody in my life.

14:25.598 --> 14:28.867
Sort of a sad thing
to wink about, I realize now.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.535
Aren't you supposed to be
babysitting Gina?

14:30.537 --> 14:32.370
Doesn't need my help.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.572
She's over there,
dazzling some psychologists.

14:34.574 --> 14:37.175
All men are at least 30%
attracted to me.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.210
My mother cried
the day I was born,

14:39.212 --> 14:42.313
Because she knew she would
never be better than me.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.616
At any given moment,
I'm thinking about one thing:

14:44.618 --> 14:48.186
Richard dreyfuss hunkered over
eating dog food.

14:48.188 --> 14:51.122
I feel like
I'm the paris of people.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.558
Complete overlap of ego and id.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.926
It's been theorized,

14:54.928 --> 14:56.661
But I never thought
I'd see it.

14:56.663 --> 14:57.962
I'm exquisite.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.037
I can't believe
I'm frenching in the closet.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.605
I feel like a teenager!

15:07.607 --> 15:09.540
I feel like I'm 40 again.

15:09.542 --> 15:10.575
Chew on this shiso leaf.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.543
It'll give our kissing

15:12.545 --> 15:14.445
Umami flavor.

15:20.953 --> 15:23.154
Delicious.

15:24.423 --> 15:27.492
Time to put my newfound
knowledge to the test.

15:27.494 --> 15:31.663
So, sir, popcorn setting,
always too short, am I right?

15:31.665 --> 15:33.398
I'm sorry?

15:33.400 --> 15:36.067
On our microwave.
We have the same microwave.

15:36.069 --> 15:39.537
Oh, I didn't buy it.
It came with the house.

15:39.539 --> 15:42.440
Hummus.
Thoughts?

15:42.442 --> 15:45.677
I have no thoughts
about hummus.

15:45.679 --> 15:47.445
If you'll excuse me.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.314
Yeah.

15:51.216 --> 15:53.351
Blink twice if you'd like me
to mercy kill you.

15:53.353 --> 15:54.619
I thought I had done
enough recon,

15:54.621 --> 15:57.455
But clearly, I have only
scratched the surface.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.958
If I'm gonna bond with him,

15:59.960 --> 16:02.493
I have to massively violate
his privacy.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.429
But truffaut
wrote breathless,

16:04.431 --> 16:06.965
And I've always considered
movies a writer's medium.

16:06.967 --> 16:10.134
I can't agree.
It's godard's film.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.502
Come on!

16:11.504 --> 16:13.538
I mean, truffaut
is also important.

16:13.540 --> 16:16.641
Seriously?
Hold this, I gotta go.

16:18.510 --> 16:21.279
Wow.
Maybe it is truffaut's film.

16:21.281 --> 16:24.315
Mighty dvr, tell me
the captain's secrets.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.117
Unveil yourself to me.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.753
Ooh, how it's made:
Contact lenses.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.222
Bingo!

16:32.292 --> 16:33.458
What are you doing here?

16:33.460 --> 16:35.693
I--what? I'm not.
What are you doing here?

16:35.695 --> 16:37.595
I need to find a New Yorker
that Kevin left by the bed,

16:37.597 --> 16:40.365
So I can justify
this whole proslavery stance

16:40.367 --> 16:41.499
I've backed myself into.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.302
Detectives!

16:44.304 --> 16:45.670
Sarge! I see that you,

16:45.672 --> 16:49.040
Like I, came up here
to chastise Santiago.

16:49.042 --> 16:51.209
Amy, this is low,
even for you.

16:51.211 --> 16:54.012
I cannot believe
you would both violate

16:54.014 --> 16:55.413
The "please stay downstairs"
rule,

16:55.415 --> 16:57.015
Which was prominently posted!

16:57.017 --> 16:59.217
Get outta here!

16:59.219 --> 17:01.352
I don't know why we have to
have this discussion again.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.353
What do we do?

17:02.355 --> 17:04.454
Bathroom! Bathroom.

17:07.226 --> 17:08.659
Why are you upset with me?

17:08.661 --> 17:10.461
Your employees are the ones
putting a damper on the party.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.195
They are acting terribly.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.564
You're the one who's been
acting terribly tonight.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.665
You've been curt and snobby
with my guests.

17:15.667 --> 17:17.535
You've been needling
poor Peralta so much,

17:17.537 --> 17:19.237
You've practically
made him a new suit.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.570
Needled him a new suit.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.306
Even when we're fighting,
you're hilarious.

17:22.308 --> 17:24.142
Stop it.
Stop it.

17:24.144 --> 17:27.377
Oh, no!
Dog, allergies, sneezing.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.479
No! Get away!

17:28.481 --> 17:29.480
Shh.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.416
Grab the dog!

17:35.187 --> 17:36.587
Look at me.

17:36.589 --> 17:39.590
Do not blow this for us.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.225
You know what, I knew
this wasn't going to work.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.094
It never has.
We should've just gone out

17:43.096 --> 17:44.495
For dinner to a restaurant,
like we do every year.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.297
Why did you make me
invite them?

17:46.299 --> 17:48.332
I made you invite them
because I like them.

17:48.334 --> 17:49.600
They're good people.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.573
Santiago, are you hiding
in my bathroom

17:55.575 --> 17:58.509
With a dog that
you're deathly allergic to?

17:58.511 --> 17:59.844
No.

18:04.550 --> 18:06.551
Occupied?

18:10.489 --> 18:12.190
Well, this has been
a stinky 12 hours.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.825
My computer bag got a hole
in the bottom,

18:13.827 --> 18:15.460
And my power cord
fell out.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.628
Last night
was such a disaster.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.764
I wheeze-cried myself
to sleep.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.632
Well, at least captain
said he liked us,

18:21.634 --> 18:23.334
Right before he kicked us
out of his house

18:23.336 --> 18:24.569
For violating his trust.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.471
Why didn't Kevin
want to invite us?

18:26.473 --> 18:28.639
We could have been
really cool people.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.842
We weren't,
but we could've been.

18:30.844 --> 18:33.277
Well, as soon as he unveiled
his "no cop talk" policy,

18:33.279 --> 18:34.712
I was sunk.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.681
Gruesome murders are
the cornerstone of my charm.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.549
Well, he spent the last 30 years
with a cop.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.685
Maybe he's sick
of hearing about it.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.587
Wait.

18:42.589 --> 18:45.289
Maybe that's not
what he's sick of.

18:45.291 --> 18:48.259
Santiago, you brilliant bastard,
you figured it out!

18:52.564 --> 18:54.765
Hello again,
professor Kevin Cozner.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.467
What do you want?

18:56.469 --> 18:59.203
I'd like to tell you
about a case I solved.

18:59.205 --> 19:00.705
Thank you,
but just as with my home,

19:00.707 --> 19:02.707
My office has a strict
"no cop talk" policy.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.542
I figured, but the case
that I have solved

19:04.544 --> 19:06.744
Is the case
of the "no cop talk" policy.

19:06.746 --> 19:09.714
There were three things that
bothered me about last night:

19:09.716 --> 19:11.616
You didn't want the nine-nine
at your party,

19:11.618 --> 19:13.417
Even though
you'd never met us,

19:13.419 --> 19:14.852
Your friends immediately
asked Hitchcock and Scully

19:14.854 --> 19:16.554
If they were harassed,

19:16.556 --> 19:17.788
And there was
something interesting

19:17.790 --> 19:19.790
About that photo
in your library--

19:19.792 --> 19:22.226
You and the captain
were shunted off to the side.

19:22.228 --> 19:23.728
I don't think
you dislike cop talk.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.563
I think you dislike cops.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.331
I'm married to one.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.233
I know, and I can't imagine
it's been fun

19:29.235 --> 19:31.802
Watching the man you love
marGinalized, underappreciated,

19:31.804 --> 19:33.738
And disrespected
by the nypd.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.706
Because he's gay, Raymond
has been put through hell

19:35.708 --> 19:37.475
By his colleagues,
many of whom,

19:37.477 --> 19:39.377
Quite frankly,
look exactly like you.

19:39.379 --> 19:42.213
Devastatingly handsome?

19:42.215 --> 19:43.681
I'm sorry,
I'm uncomfortable with emotions.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.750
So yes, I decided
a long time ago

19:45.752 --> 19:47.552
That just because
I love Raymond

19:47.554 --> 19:50.454
Doesn't mean I have to love
the people he works with.

19:50.456 --> 19:51.756
Good solve, detective.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.457
Nice cop lingo.

19:53.459 --> 19:56.794
Look, I'm really sorry
that we ruined your party.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.596
I'd like to make it up
to you.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.898
Captain, thank you
for joining us.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.333
What's going on?

20:02.335 --> 20:03.701
A proper birthday dinner.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.303
Amy chose the restaurant.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.804
Captain.

20:06.806 --> 20:09.574
Ah, perfect.
I've always wanted to come here.

20:09.576 --> 20:10.875
Boyle picked the menu.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.677
Vivian helped.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.879
Terry chose the champagne.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.281
I'm sorry
about your party, sir.

20:17.283 --> 20:19.784
I tried to keep them in line,
but I failed.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.552
Well, that's not your job.
I'm only sorry

20:21.554 --> 20:22.787
You didn't get a chance
to enjoy yourself.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.289
Gina has brought back
all the silverware

20:25.291 --> 20:26.958
That she stole
from your house.

20:28.794 --> 20:31.862
What?
Also, this clock.

20:31.864 --> 20:32.863
Good heavens.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.465
This isn't ours.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.400
And my contribution
will be to refrain

20:36.402 --> 20:39.804
From discussing The New Yorker
for the rest of my living days.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.006
Enjoy.
Thank you, jake.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.774
You're welcome, Kevin.
Call me "Kev."

20:43.776 --> 20:45.643
Oh.
What?

20:45.645 --> 20:47.311
Oh, he told you to say that,
didn't he?

20:47.313 --> 20:49.480
Well, you are always playing
pranks on me, Raymond.

20:49.482 --> 20:50.681
Just once, let me
be the funny one.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.784
And finally,
it is my great pleasure

20:53.786 --> 20:56.754
To introduce the nine-nine zone
detective Scully

20:56.756 --> 20:58.789
To serenade you.
