00:19.894 --> 00:21.396
-Like that?
- Mira, Pop.

00:51.551 --> 00:52.427
And my sombrero.

00:52.510 --> 00:55.055
No, cut the sombrero,
you're not a country singer.

02:10.505 --> 02:13.216
Since when do you care about what I wear?

02:22.225 --> 02:23.977
As if it were my first communion?

02:34.279 --> 02:36.906
You have to be clear and concise, eh?

02:44.581 --> 02:46.166
No. Fame is for influencers.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.018
So, be ready.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.734
Please.
Do I look like a child?

03:12.817 --> 03:14.736
I've done it more than 2,000 times.

03:14.819 --> 03:17.238
I don't need anybody
to hold my hand and take me.

03:17.864 --> 03:21.576
And you should go be with Chris.
You have your own problems to fix.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.252
- What do you think of this?
-No. Ernesto, come.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.922
I'm going to show you where.
Take a look at this map.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.182
Plus he threw the turkey.

03:44.265 --> 03:45.934
Let the brat repent in the woods.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.352
If you don't make up now,

03:47.435 --> 03:50.480
you'll end up
not talking to each other for ten years.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.398
That leaves scars.

03:52.482 --> 03:56.236
Don't lose the same time
we lost with each other.

07:55.099 --> 07:57.477
It's a shame that Mama Fina's is closed.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.811
I loved it.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.522
Thank you.

08:17.830 --> 08:21.334
You're very popular,
Mr. Morales. We all know you around here.

08:21.959 --> 08:24.170
Are you being paid for these interviews?

08:24.670 --> 08:26.672
-You making any money from this?
-No, friend.

08:33.387 --> 08:35.056
How did you enter the country?

08:35.806 --> 08:37.517
I came alone.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.477
Your court appearance is December 12th.

08:39.560 --> 08:42.396
When you are deported,
do you have a Mexican passport?

08:42.480 --> 08:43.898
No. "When" they deport me?

08:47.276 --> 08:49.153
Have you committed any new crimes?

08:50.988 --> 08:53.157
I don't understand.
Why are you asking me that?

09:00.081 --> 09:01.165
None.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.669
-Where are you living?
-

09:04.752 --> 09:06.504
-I'm over by…
- With who?

09:17.807 --> 09:20.059
Why are you putting
your family through this?

09:55.511 --> 09:56.637
Fuck you!

14:05.553 --> 14:09.181
What's that nonsense about Mr. Tapatio?
I'm General Zapata.

14:09.265 --> 14:13.269
And you're a coward. You're a loser!

14:14.353 --> 14:18.816
And you'll never represent
your family honorably! Asshole!

15:02.818 --> 15:05.946
What are you doing,
Casimiro? What are you doing?

17:01.520 --> 17:05.274
-I mean, Pop might really get deported--
- Don't say that.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.220
I spent the whole day looking for you.

19:40.304 --> 19:41.221
I'm okay.

19:41.763 --> 19:42.598
I'm okay.

19:43.557 --> 19:44.766
I'm glad you're okay.

19:45.934 --> 19:47.477
But I'm not.

19:49.271 --> 19:52.608
Lupe, my love. My love…

19:54.526 --> 19:58.822
I tried calling Ana and the boys.

19:58.906 --> 20:01.992
I called every hospital,
the police station, the ICE center.

20:02.075 --> 20:03.827
No, my love…

20:07.748 --> 20:10.250
Today, I felt
what it was like to lose you.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.296
We have much to fight for.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.800
They'll have to take me by force.

23:33.703 --> 23:35.288
Yes, I've…

23:35.372 --> 23:37.833
worked in many kitchens.

23:39.084 --> 23:41.711
And I'm ready for the next opportunity.

23:42.587 --> 23:43.839
No matter where it is.

24:46.776 --> 24:48.403
No, I'm not scared.

24:49.321 --> 24:50.405
The fear is gone.

25:29.694 --> 25:30.820
And what?

25:31.655 --> 25:32.948
You want to…

25:33.031 --> 25:36.284
Because I don't have a piece of paper
you want to destroy my family?

25:50.507 --> 25:51.883
Not even that.

25:52.926 --> 25:56.096
Even dogs are treated
better than an undocumented.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.064
But you want to rip the dream from me.

26:18.201 --> 26:19.411
Stop lying.
