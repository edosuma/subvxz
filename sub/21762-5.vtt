00:48.507 --> 00:49.466
-[Julien] Shh.
-Huh?

00:49.550 --> 00:53.387
Quiet, Clover.
Can't you see I'm hiding from my parents?

00:53.679 --> 00:56.431
Uh. Are they coming?
Do they have the bell?

00:56.515 --> 00:58.099
Do you hear it? The bell!

00:58.183 --> 00:59.018
The bell!

00:59.100 --> 01:02.103
[screams maniacally]

01:02.312 --> 01:04.398
Why are you hiding from your parents,
King Julien?

01:04.481 --> 01:07.317
Because they're doing
all sorts of parenty stuff.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.028
Trying to love me and take care of me.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.487
It's driving me crazy!

01:10.571 --> 01:14.157
Mom? Dad? I can't breathe!

01:14.241 --> 01:15.826
You needed a bath, Julien.

01:15.910 --> 01:18.453
You were starting to smell
like the middle class, Son.

01:18.537 --> 01:21.623
Oh, look, Barty,
he's getting hair under his arms.

01:21.707 --> 01:24.626
I'm a full-grown lemur.
I've got hair all over!

Boombox is having an episode!

01:36.263 --> 01:37.264
You're welcome.

01:38.306 --> 01:41.685
Now, old boy, just hold still.
It's just a teeth cleaning.

01:43.062 --> 01:45.272
Dr. S? You're not a dentist.

Oh, just say the word, handsome.

02:02.957 --> 02:04.959
[Barty] Knock-knock. Anyone home?

02:05.667 --> 02:07.335
It's the parents. They've got the bell.

02:07.419 --> 02:10.213
And they're gonna ring it.
They'll do it. I know they will!

02:10.297 --> 02:13.717
-No! [screams] No!
-[thud]

02:13.842 --> 02:15.135
Julien, there you are.

02:15.218 --> 02:18.013
I thought we were meeting
down at the Cove Of Wonders

02:18.097 --> 02:19.681
to find you a new wardrobe.

02:19.765 --> 02:21.976
Top hats and spats, old chum.

02:22.559 --> 02:26.605
[coughing]
I wish you had never given birth to me.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.398
[coughs] Sorry, had a little...

02:28.482 --> 02:31.234
Sounds great, Mom and Dad!
[chuckles nervously]

02:31.443 --> 02:33.988
[whispers] Find out when they are leaving.

02:34.071 --> 02:37.616
[clears throat] Your Majesties. Hi!
Yeah, have you picked a date yet

02:37.699 --> 02:40.911
for when you're gonna be, you know,
[chuckles] leaving?

02:40.995 --> 02:43.246
'Cause I know, originally, you were--

02:43.330 --> 02:48.085
Oh, yes. About that.
We've decided to make our stay permanent.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.419
[echoing] Permanent.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.170
[stuttering] P-P-P-P-P-P--

02:51.755 --> 02:53.882
Both your father and I think
you could use our help.

02:53.966 --> 02:55.884
Not that you're doing a bad job.

02:55.968 --> 02:56.885
That's only part of it.

02:56.969 --> 03:00.179
But also because we've discovered
something amazing.

03:00.263 --> 03:03.600
-What do they call it, Barty?
-"Emotions," dear.

03:04.601 --> 03:07.228
Nothing could ever
get us to leave you again.

03:07.312 --> 03:10.273
Yes. We'd have to be
dragged away against our will

03:10.357 --> 03:12.233
if you wanted to get rid of us.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.485
[Julien grumbles]

03:14.402 --> 03:15.612
Family.

03:17.031 --> 03:19.867
You want me to kidnap your parents?

03:19.950 --> 03:21.910
Yes. It's the only way.

03:21.994 --> 03:24.746
Just so we're, you know,
just being clear here,

03:24.830 --> 03:29.626
this is to get them to-to leave, right?
Not to, [chuckles] you know, like...

03:29.710 --> 03:31.920
[choking, groaning]

03:32.963 --> 03:35.090
[grunting]

03:36.050 --> 03:36.925

[grunting, groaning]

03:39.636 --> 03:40.721
[groans]

03:40.846 --> 03:43.557
Clover, no! I don't want to hurt them.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.434
I just want them
fake-kidnapped and scared.

03:46.518 --> 03:49.771
Then, once I fake-rescue them,
they'll be too terrified

03:49.855 --> 03:53.650
to stay here in this "dangerous kingdom"
one minute longer.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.528
A job like this is gonna take mad skills,

03:56.611 --> 04:00.199
which is why I hired
the best actors in the biz.

04:00.281 --> 04:01.616
Oh, hurray!

04:01.700 --> 04:04.161
Dorothy, show 'em your backwards slow-mo.

04:04.244 --> 04:09.290
Look, she's running.
And I'm a tree. A mighty oak.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.085
[laughs excitedly]

04:11.168 --> 04:14.421
And now, I'm a willow in the wind.

04:15.005 --> 04:15.923
I don't get it.

04:16.006 --> 04:17.216
Me neither!

04:17.298 --> 04:18.884
What are you playing at?

04:18.967 --> 04:21.678
Clover, Mort, both of you calm down.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.430
This is why we are here.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.306
-Ted? Dorothy?
-[both] Huh?

04:25.390 --> 04:26.892
I have a job for you.

04:27.559 --> 04:31.354
[Rob] I know we've had our differences
in the past, Maurice,

04:31.438 --> 04:32.647
but I've changed.

04:32.731 --> 04:35.692
I don't hate the lemur
in the mirror anymore.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.446
Thanks, Rob... Uh, Nurse Phantom.
I appreciate that.

04:39.696 --> 04:43.200
Anything you need?
A sparkling water, perhaps?

04:43.784 --> 04:44.826
I'm good. Thank you.

04:45.911 --> 04:47.121
Hot towel?

04:47.204 --> 04:48.205
I'm fine.

04:49.372 --> 04:50.540
Snickerdoodle?

04:50.624 --> 04:51.917
No! Thank you.

04:52.584 --> 04:55.587
So, Maurice, what seems to be the problem?

04:55.670 --> 04:58.465
[stammers]
It's these bells I keep hearing, doc.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.926
Ringing and ringing. I can't take it.

05:01.342 --> 05:05.680
The problem is King Julien's parents.
His mom has this little bell and--

05:05.764 --> 05:08.308
Pap-pap-pap-pap! Are you a doctor?

05:08.391 --> 05:11.937
-Um, no.
-Neither am I. [chuckles]

05:12.020 --> 05:16.775
But I promise we will get to
the real bottom of your bell problem,

05:16.858 --> 05:19.027
or you will die trying!

05:19.111 --> 05:20.946
[stammering] Again, please?

05:21.029 --> 05:22.489
Shiatsu massage?

05:22.990 --> 05:26.827
Right, if this is going down,
then I'm gonna be in charge. Got it?

05:27.161 --> 05:29.329
Well, I'm not so sure
what you know about acting--

05:29.412 --> 05:33.667
-I'm in charge, Ted! End of discussion.
-Oh, golly. You're a natural.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.210
All right. Listen up.

05:35.294 --> 05:37.462
I'd like to solve the puzzle, Clover.

05:37.545 --> 05:39.047
-[Ted groans]
-This isn't a game show.

05:39.131 --> 05:43.051
Once the package has been acquired,
we'll all rendezvous back here.

05:43.135 --> 05:45.095
Remember, Barty and Julienne know me.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.471
So, I won't be able to show my face.

05:46.554 --> 05:49.348
That means you're on your own with them.
Got it?

05:49.432 --> 05:50.934
-Yes, ma'am!
-You betcha.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.936
Yeah, sure,
I'm totally listening and stuff.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.229
I brought the glove.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.564
Good idea, Mort. No fingerprints.

05:56.648 --> 05:58.984
Right. Fingerprints.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.028
[sniffs, giggles]

06:01.111 --> 06:03.238
Now, let's do this old school.

06:03.322 --> 06:06.283
Drive by
and grab the parents off the street.

06:06.365 --> 06:09.161
-Bright and breezy.
-Mm-hmm. Hm-hmm.

06:12.039 --> 06:15.500
Man, I'm really enjoying our walk.
[chuckles]

06:15.583 --> 06:18.920
[inhales and exhales loudly]
So much fresh air.

06:20.755 --> 06:22.757
-[Julien sighs]
-Oh, Barty.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.053
[Julienne]
Do you know who I got a letter from?

06:26.136 --> 06:28.429
[Mort screams] No brakes!

is trying to leave my body.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.440
[groaning]

06:39.524 --> 06:42.443
Get in there!
Where do you think you're going?

06:43.237 --> 06:47.324
Okay, new plan.
This time, you go under cover of darkness.

06:53.205 --> 06:54.664
Ssh. Whoa!

07:00.379 --> 07:02.172
[Julien] Don't worry, Mom and Dad,

07:02.256 --> 07:05.300
your son is here to rescue you,
so you can leave the kingdom

07:05.384 --> 07:09.428
because, clearly, it's far too dangerous
for you to hang around here and uh...

07:09.512 --> 07:10.805
[snoring]

07:10.889 --> 07:12.349
These are not my parents!

07:12.933 --> 07:15.518
Blugh! What's going on?
[screams] Todd!

07:15.602 --> 07:18.813
-[whimpering]
-Come and save Mama, baby--

07:19.689 --> 07:21.149
Oh! That's it!

07:21.233 --> 07:25.404
You are all the worst kidnappers ever!
And you're fired. Fired!

07:25.486 --> 07:29.449
[dejectedly] You can't recast.
I am Kidnapper No. 2.

07:29.532 --> 07:33.245
I will carry the scars
of this role forev--

07:33.828 --> 07:37.874
Don't worry, King Julien,
I'll handle your parents. Personally.

07:37.999 --> 07:38.917
[Ted] Oopsie.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.669
[clears throat] What time is it?

07:42.379 --> 07:43.880
Gotta go to work, babe.

07:45.299 --> 07:49.344
If you want someone fake-napped properly,
you have to do it yourself.

07:51.512 --> 07:54.682
What in the... What? Huh?

07:56.643 --> 07:58.353
Hi, Clover.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.521
Karl! What are you... [gasps]

08:00.605 --> 08:02.399
You took Barty and Julienne?

08:02.482 --> 08:05.360
That's right. I beat you to it.

08:05.444 --> 08:06.569
-But--
-Uh-uh-uh.

08:06.653 --> 08:10.324
Wish I had time to chat,
but my guests are waiting.

08:10.407 --> 08:13.160
Wouldn't want to be rude. Chauncey!

-[thud]

08:17.789 --> 08:19.582
[rooster crowing]

08:19.916 --> 08:22.627
Looks like somebody
had a really crazy party.

08:23.462 --> 08:26.256
Ah... [chuckles]

08:26.340 --> 08:31.052
It looks like Clover actually did it.
She fake-napped my parents.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.972
Now, all we have to do
is find where she stashed them,

08:34.055 --> 08:37.725
set them free, and they'll be convinced
to leave forever and--

08:37.809 --> 08:38.643
[groaning]

08:38.726 --> 08:41.188
Mort, take your pained
moaning and groaning outside.

08:41.355 --> 08:42.563
You know the rules.

08:42.647 --> 08:46.567
It's not me.
I took care of my rib problem. [chuckles]

08:46.776 --> 08:49.237
-I'm all good.
-[groaning]

08:49.654 --> 08:50.489

-[screams] Clover!
-[Clover groaning]

08:53.950 --> 08:56.453
-King Julien, there's a note.
-Huh?

08:56.703 --> 09:02.959
"Julien, greetings, my nemesis.
It's Karl, and I have your parents.

09:03.043 --> 09:06.129
-[gasps]
-If you ever want to see them alive again,

09:06.213 --> 09:08.006
follow the directions to my lair,

09:08.089 --> 09:10.717
which you will find
in this fun, pop-up book.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.261
I designed it myself. I hope you like it."

09:13.345 --> 09:15.638
Uh... Oh! [chuckles]

09:15.763 --> 09:16.890
Oh. [laughs]

09:16.973 --> 09:19.142
That is kinda nice. [chuckles]

09:19.226 --> 09:20.560
And there's another one!

09:21.186 --> 09:23.104
[laughs excitedly]

09:23.522 --> 09:24.356
So fun.

09:27.442 --> 09:30.070
-Tell me what you see.
-Bell.

09:31.654 --> 09:32.822
That's a bell.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.075
Two bells. Side by side.

09:35.158 --> 09:37.744
They may be friends or partners
on the police force or something.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.789
Uh...

09:41.873 --> 09:42.957
Give me a minute.

09:43.542 --> 09:44.501
Seriously?

09:44.584 --> 09:48.880
I-I feel like I want to say "hat,"
or maybe, like, a mushroom cap?

09:49.130 --> 09:54.219
This is worse than I thought.
You are one sick individual!

09:54.553 --> 09:55.554
Sick!

09:55.887 --> 10:01.518
Nurse Phantom! Wheel in the gurney,
and bring the extra straps.

10:02.685 --> 10:03.728

10:06.940 --> 10:08.775

10:10.110 --> 10:11.152
Uh...

10:13.238 --> 10:16.032
I can only imagine
what kind of horrible torture

10:16.116 --> 10:18.452
Karl is putting
my parents through right now.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.495
[grunts, gasps]

10:20.579 --> 10:21.704
[laughing wickedly]

10:21.788 --> 10:23.331
-Karl!
-[both laughing]

10:24.082 --> 10:25.459
Wonderful!

10:26.251 --> 10:27.502
Uh...

10:30.755 --> 10:33.841
Mom? Dad? What is going on here?

10:33.925 --> 10:36.386
Oh, Julie, we've known Karl for years.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.721
Yes, I cherish our friendship.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.600
[Julienne] Why, he got rid
of that repulsive rat tribe

10:41.682 --> 10:45.895
so we could put in the back nine
of the golf course at the country club.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.105
Inspired!

10:47.188 --> 10:49.274
Saved our ascots, old sport.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.901
Why didn't you mention
he lived so close by?

10:51.985 --> 10:55.572
Oh, I don't know,
maybe because he's a crazy psycho

10:55.655 --> 10:57.907
that's tried to murder me,
like, a gazillion times!

10:57.991 --> 10:59.659
Why don't you take a seat?

11:00.285 --> 11:01.661
I'd rather stand.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.330
I insist.

11:03.413 --> 11:06.249
Yes, Son, don't be
such a brickmaker's daughter.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.376
When your host says sit, you sit.

11:08.460 --> 11:09.461
[growls]

11:10.211 --> 11:12.297
No, that one.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.214
[groans]

11:14.882 --> 11:16.551
[grunting]

11:16.635 --> 11:17.718
No. That one.

11:19.262 --> 11:21.598
[humming]

11:22.056 --> 11:24.267
No. [screams] That one!

11:29.564 --> 11:30.482
No!

11:30.565 --> 11:35.403
Don't make me
assume my ultimate form, Julien.

11:35.487 --> 11:36.988
[imitates Karl mockingly]

11:38.448 --> 11:42.076
Finally. Now that I have you all
in the proper chairs--

11:42.160 --> 11:43.744
Whatever. [groans]

11:43.828 --> 11:46.080
Manners, Julien.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.457
Oh, thank you, Barty.

11:47.874 --> 11:50.918
Welcome, Julien and family, to...

11:51.127 --> 11:55.256
the last moment of the rest of your lives!

11:55.340 --> 11:57.716
-[both laughing]
-Ugh!

11:57.842 --> 11:59.052
-[Barty] Wonderful!
-[beeps]

12:00.094 --> 12:01.680
[all screaming]

12:01.762 --> 12:04.307
[laughing maniacally]

12:06.643 --> 12:10.230
[Mort] And I walked right up behind him
and tapped him on the shoulder,

12:10.313 --> 12:14.901
and it was Pancho. But, of course,
I wasn't looking for Pancho,

12:14.984 --> 12:16.444
I was looking for Horst,

12:16.528 --> 12:18.279
-who heard me saying...
-[Clover straining]

12:18.363 --> 12:21.074
Please make it stop.
Wake up, Clover! Wake up!

12:21.157 --> 12:25.036
You see, I had borrowed
Horst's salad fork... [blows raspberry]

12:25.119 --> 12:28.831
but I really wasn't making a salad,
even though I did need the salad fork,

12:28.915 --> 12:32.126
and Horst was the only guy
who had one and-- [groans]

12:32.293 --> 12:36.256
Karl! [pants] Where's Karl?
What happened? Where is King Julien?

12:36.339 --> 12:38.717
No idea. I did find this note though.

12:38.799 --> 12:41.511
"It's Karl, and I have your parents.

12:41.595 --> 12:46.641
If you ever want to see them alive again,
follow the directions to my lair."

12:46.725 --> 12:47.975
I mesmerized it.

12:48.059 --> 12:50.562
All right, let's go. Whoa! [groans]

12:50.853 --> 12:53.356
As soon as the floor stops spinning.
[laughs]

12:54.148 --> 12:57.736
There we go, Maurice. Comfy?

12:57.818 --> 12:59.738
I'm a little nervous, actually.

12:59.987 --> 13:05.493
[slurps] How about some cherries jubilee?
Guaranteed smiles.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.328
No. Thanks, Rob.

13:08.705 --> 13:09.706
Baba ganoush.

13:09.788 --> 13:12.041
Nothing! Okay? I don't want anything.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.835
[gasps] No reason to get hostile.

13:14.919 --> 13:19.758
Just trying to make you comfortable.
You know, doing my job. [slurps]

13:21.217 --> 13:26.473
Let's begin. Think back. Very far back.

13:26.556 --> 13:29.643
When did you first hear the bells?

13:29.726 --> 13:34.939
There's something I just remembered,
but if I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.650
Nurse Phantom?

13:37.275 --> 13:40.361
-[electricity surging]
-[teeth chattering]

13:40.945 --> 13:42.989
[laughs, slurps]

13:43.531 --> 13:45.450
Gah! What the heck was that for?

13:45.533 --> 13:48.328
How dare you decide what's crazy?

13:48.411 --> 13:53.166
Have you forgotten we're doing
brain therapy [screams] out of a cave?

13:53.249 --> 13:54.501
[echoes] Cave!

13:55.084 --> 13:58.379
Moving on. Please, tell me everything.

13:58.463 --> 14:03.050
Ah, I must've blocked this out of my
memory, but somehow, you jarred it loose.

14:03.134 --> 14:04.302
It's coming back to me now.

14:04.385 --> 14:07.555
When I was a little lemur,
I got lost in the jungle.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.015
[electricity surging]

14:09.098 --> 14:10.183
What was that for?

14:10.266 --> 14:13.060
-Nurse Phantom, please!
-[giggles, slurps]

14:13.394 --> 14:16.564
I was in the jungle
and I fell down this hole in a tree stump.

14:18.399 --> 14:19.900
The hole went on forever.

14:20.485 --> 14:24.739
And when I finally hit the bottom,
I couldn't believe what I saw.

14:24.823 --> 14:27.408
[tinkling]

14:29.703 --> 14:32.163
An entire city of living bells!

14:32.246 --> 14:34.123
[panting]

14:34.207 --> 14:36.793
[screams]

14:38.085 --> 14:39.253
What do you think, Doctor?

14:39.879 --> 14:44.843
I think you're right. Th-that's crazy!
[laughs]

14:45.343 --> 14:49.096
Don't tell that story
to anyone ever again.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.765
Woof! [laughs hysterically]

14:50.849 --> 14:52.975
-[switch flipping]
-[electricity surging]

14:53.059 --> 14:57.480
Okay, you know what, Nurse Phantom?
Not helping! Not helping!

14:57.564 --> 15:00.900
You've just shocked your way
right out of electrode duty.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.237
Maybe someone should watch
what they're saying

15:04.320 --> 15:08.282
when someone is trying to be nice,
Maurice. [slurps]

15:08.366 --> 15:09.534
[screams] Get out!

15:09.617 --> 15:13.830
[sobbing] No one appreciates
what I bring to the table.

15:14.205 --> 15:15.456
[all screaming]

15:15.665 --> 15:20.336
[Karl over PA system]  Welcome, King Julien
and parents to the Love Gauntlet.

15:22.839 --> 15:26.384
[blows raspberry]
You've gotta be kidding! "Love Gauntlet."

15:26.467 --> 15:27.802
[both] Hmm.

15:28.469 --> 15:30.263
[Karl]  Prepare yourselves
for an unforgiving series

15:30.346 --> 15:31.514
of difficult questions

15:31.598 --> 15:36.185
that you will have to answer
as a family unit. Or face certain doom.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.937
[Chauncey clicks, snarls]

15:38.020 --> 15:39.230
[Karl]  Do let's begin.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.024
[Barty and Julienne applauding, cheering]

15:42.108 --> 15:43.234
[Julien] Huh? [grumbles]

15:43.317 --> 15:45.111
-[female robotic voice]  I am Love Bot.
-[blows raspberry]

15:45.194 --> 15:48.698
First question.
What is Julien's favorite color?

15:48.782 --> 15:51.618
Um, if wealth is a color,
I think it's wealth?

15:51.701 --> 15:53.119
-[machine blares]
-[Love Bot]  Incorrect.

15:53.202 --> 15:57.791
Wealth? Really? It's pumpkin!
Pumpkin is my favorite color.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.417
Could it be more obvious?

15:59.500 --> 16:02.420
-[rumbling]
-[maniacal laughter]

16:04.756 --> 16:05.965
[all whimpering]

16:06.048 --> 16:08.718
[Love Bot]  Next question.
What is Julien's favorite song?

16:08.802 --> 16:10.177
Oh, pass.

16:10.261 --> 16:11.930
-[machine blares]
-[Love Bot]  Incorrect.

16:12.012 --> 16:14.808
[Karl laughs maniacally]

16:14.891 --> 16:16.643
Sorry, dear, I-I panicked.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.812
[Love Bot]  Is Julien a girl or a boy?

16:18.895 --> 16:19.813
[gasps]

16:19.896 --> 16:22.064
No one said there would be
science questions.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.274
-[Love Bot]  Incorrect.
-[machine blares]

16:23.357 --> 16:25.067
Who is Julien's best friend?

16:25.652 --> 16:26.653
-Mark! It's Mark.
-Mark!

16:26.736 --> 16:27.779
[machine blares]

16:30.156 --> 16:32.742
[mumbling unintelligibly]

16:32.826 --> 16:37.079
You mustn't look away.
You must face your fears.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.749
[Maurice] All this is doing
is making me hate birthday cakes.

16:39.833 --> 16:40.834
Turn the dang bell off!

16:40.917 --> 16:44.838
Feel it, Maurice. Embrace the horror!

16:45.546 --> 16:49.759
[gasps, screams]

16:49.884 --> 16:53.137
[gasps] I actually think
it might've worked. I feel okay.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.931
This... This thing worked?

16:55.014 --> 16:56.265
Yeah. I feel better.

16:56.850 --> 17:01.103
-So you're saying I'm a genius?
-I am definitely not saying that.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.606
Well, what would you say to this?

17:03.690 --> 17:05.024
[clanging]

17:05.608 --> 17:06.985
Success!

17:07.067 --> 17:12.657
Now, I am one step closer
to brainwashing the entire village!

17:12.740 --> 17:14.367
-Psycho, say what now?
-Nothing.

17:14.951 --> 17:15.785
Lolly?

17:17.370 --> 17:20.247
-A Jack and two Jerrys.
-[machine blares]

17:20.331 --> 17:21.666
-In the ear.
-[machine blares]

17:21.749 --> 17:24.627
Oh. A school for underprivileged dogs.

17:24.711 --> 17:25.837
[machine blares]

17:25.920 --> 17:28.422
-A dubious backstory.
-[machine blares]

17:28.506 --> 17:30.925
-The maid is stealing.
-[machine blares]

17:31.009 --> 17:32.886
-Baby arms.
-[machine blares]

17:32.969 --> 17:33.803
[Love Bot]  Incorrect.

17:33.887 --> 17:36.096
-[Karl laughs maniacally]
-[Julienne] Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.140
[all whimpering]

17:38.224 --> 17:40.894
We are not doing so good
as a family here, peoples.

17:42.562 --> 17:48.026
Julien, you must know by now
that I did this for us.

17:48.108 --> 17:54.156
To prove, we are the same.
My parents never loved me.

17:54.240 --> 17:59.913
And I wanted...
[screams] nay, needed, to prove to you

18:00.038 --> 18:03.041
that your parents never loved you either!

18:03.833 --> 18:06.669
And I've done it! [laughs maniacally]

18:06.753 --> 18:09.129
And I like it!

18:09.589 --> 18:12.091
Yeah. You win or whatever, Karl.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.343
Ask the last question,
let's get this over with.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.055
Oh, we can, Julien.
And when your parents get it wrong,

18:17.137 --> 18:20.725
I shall enjoy watching the pathetic,
unloved look on your face

18:20.808 --> 18:25.980
as you all plummet to your death
by fiery hot lava!

18:26.064 --> 18:28.942
I regret ever lending you
my croquet mallet.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.985
You're off our Christmas card list!

18:31.069 --> 18:33.529
Oh, please.
I never liked your stupid cards anyway.

18:33.654 --> 18:34.614
[both gasp]

18:35.197 --> 18:38.701
Love Bot! Ask the final question!

18:38.785 --> 18:41.829
[Love Bot]  What was Julien's
favorite stuffed animal as a child?

18:42.580 --> 18:43.998
[Julien grumbles]

18:44.082 --> 18:47.085
Look at their faces! [laughs wickedly]

18:47.835 --> 18:49.420
So delicious.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.171
[straining]

18:51.255 --> 18:53.299
Oh! Oh! I actually know this one.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.508
So do I, dear.

18:54.592 --> 18:57.637
It was that stuffed hippo.
All backside really.

18:57.720 --> 19:02.391
Captain Booty-Butt. Oh, how you loved
that crusty, unwashed plushy.

19:02.475 --> 19:07.688
And how it smelled.
Like a Shanghai dry cleaner at low tide.

19:07.772 --> 19:11.818
Oh, you'd curl up with it
and go to sleep. Adorable.

19:11.901 --> 19:16.489
Yes. Captain Booty-Butt.
He never left my side!

19:16.572 --> 19:20.660
Oh, Mom and Dad, you remembered something!

19:21.243 --> 19:25.456
[Love Bot]  True love detected.
Too much love. My circuits are crying.

-Crying... Crying... Crying... Crying...

19:33.965 --> 19:36.383
-[Chauncey squeaks]
-Yes, Chauncey, in hindsight,

19:36.467 --> 19:40.138
it was a terrible idea putting
real tear ducts inside the Love Bot.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.264

19:42.348 --> 19:47.353

You didn't think I'd have a back-up plan,
did you, Julien?

20:15.715 --> 20:19.093
Relax, guys. These are my peeps.

20:19.177 --> 20:21.261
Long time no see, Captain Ethan,

Lil Arms Magee,

20:22.513 --> 20:23.472
One-Eyed Simon.

20:23.681 --> 20:25.099
Uh. And forgot your name.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.267
Hi, Mr. Julien.

20:27.351 --> 20:30.730
Hey! You took my ship and my crew.

20:30.813 --> 20:33.399
And this, will be my revenge!

20:33.482 --> 20:39.072
[Captain Ethan screams] Ow!
Hey, you guys, my legs are on fire. Wow!

20:39.197 --> 20:41.991
-[rumbling]
-[sighs]

20:42.075 --> 20:44.493
All right. Now, tear them apart.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.745
[both grunt]

20:45.870 --> 20:51.709
I don't want to interfere,
but I will give you pirates each a trophy

20:51.792 --> 20:55.421
if you take him down.
And his creepy cockroach.

20:56.005 --> 20:59.967
This isn't over, Julien.
Not yet, at least!

21:00.051 --> 21:02.136

21:06.015 --> 21:10.186

21:10.269 --> 21:12.897
And for you. Thanks for your help.

Look, I know it's been rough,
but if you guys are sticking around,

21:28.121 --> 21:31.331
I really believe we can
make it work as a family and--

21:31.582 --> 21:35.211
[Barty] Hold that thought, old sport.
Your mother and I are leaving.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.170
You are?

21:36.254 --> 21:40.091
Yes, Son. You see,
there comes a time in every child's life

21:40.174 --> 21:43.427
when they need to let their parents
leave the nest and--

21:43.510 --> 21:45.304
Wait, isn't it the other way around?

21:45.387 --> 21:48.515
Maybe. But the point is,
we don't need you anymore.

It's time for us to get back
to our luxury island resort

21:51.936 --> 21:54.438
to rest after all of this parenting.

21:54.521 --> 21:57.275
The pirates have kindly offered
to give us a ride, so...

21:57.357 --> 21:59.568
[Barty] We'll send you a postcard!
[Julienne] Ta-ta!

21:59.652 --> 22:01.361
Bye, my dearest!

22:01.737 --> 22:03.239
[both] We love you!

22:03.322 --> 22:08.119
Bye, Mommy! Bye, Daddy! Bye-bye! [sighs]

22:08.202 --> 22:09.495
[Julien] Now that they're gone,

22:09.578 --> 22:12.498
things can finally
get back to normal around here.

22:12.581 --> 22:15.876
[Maurice] King Julien, guess what.
No more bells! Isn't that great?

22:15.960 --> 22:17.461
[Julien] Oh, yeah. Great, Maurice.

22:19.505 --> 22:23.759
Maurice cannot hear us anymore.
He has forsaken us.

22:23.843 --> 22:27.888
But, Ringo, he was our Chosen One.
Where will we find another?

22:27.972 --> 22:30.099
One thing at a time, Dingbert.

22:30.557 --> 22:34.270
For now,
we will wait until the time is perfect

22:34.352 --> 22:37.606
to reclaim what is rightfully ours!
