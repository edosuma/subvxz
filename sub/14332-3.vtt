OF HYPNOTIZING A MAGIC DOG!

08:51.764 --> 08:53.733
- YOU BROUGHT A DOG
INTO THE HOUSE?

08:53.799 --> 08:57.169
YOU KNOW I'M HIGHLY ALLERGIC!

08:57.236 --> 08:58.471
[sneezes]

08:58.537 --> 09:01.774
YOU'RE GROUNDED!
GO TO YOUR ROOM.

09:05.244 --> 09:06.612
- [growls]

09:06.679 --> 09:07.813
- AH-CHOO!

09:09.715 --> 09:11.584
CALL OFF
YOUR BEAST, DENZEL!

09:11.651 --> 09:12.618
AH-CHOO!

09:12.685 --> 09:15.087
AH-CHOO, AH-CHOO!

09:15.154 --> 09:16.656
[screams]

09:16.722 --> 09:18.457
- THAT WAS FANTASTIC!

09:18.524 --> 09:21.694
I CAN USE THIS DOG TO DESTROY
ALL OF MY WORST ENEMIES.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.663
- I'VE ONLY KNOWN YOU
A SHORT TIME,

09:23.729 --> 09:26.132
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
YOU'RE YOUR OWN WORST ENEMY.

09:26.198 --> 09:27.667
- YOU'RE VERY INSIGHTFUL,
HERMAN.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.902
MOVING ON. I'LL START
BY HAVING YOU TAKE DOWN

09:29.969 --> 09:31.938
ALL THE WOMEN
WHO REJECTED ME.

09:32.004 --> 09:34.307
STARTING WITH MARCY PENDERGRAST,
WHO WOULDN'T LEND ME

09:34.373 --> 09:36.475
HER CRAYONS
IN THE FIRST GRADE.

09:36.542 --> 09:39.478
YOUR HAPPY LIFE AS A MARGINALLY
SUCCESSFUL PARALEGAL

09:39.545 --> 09:41.280
IS ABOUT
TO COME TO AN END!

09:41.347 --> 09:43.649
- UNHAND MY DOG,
YOU VAMPIRE!

09:43.716 --> 09:46.085
WAIT, WHY ARE YOU DRESSED
AS A VAMPIRE?

09:46.152 --> 09:47.820
- YOU'RE TOO LATE, TURNER!

09:47.887 --> 09:51.290
I'VE HYPNOTIZED YOUR DOG,
AND NOW HE'S ONLY LOYAL TO ME.

09:51.357 --> 09:52.725
SIC 'EM, HERMAN!

09:52.792 --> 09:54.961
- HERMAN? REALLY?
THAT'S WHAT YOU WENT WITH?

09:55.027 --> 09:56.896
- [growls]

09:56.963 --> 09:58.698
- COME ON, BOY.
IT'S ME, TIMMY.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.366
- I DON'T KNOW YOU.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.702
I BELONG TO THE WEIRD
VAMPIRE GUY.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.704
- IT'S COUNT CREAMERY!

10:04.770 --> 10:06.205
- DON'T YOU REMEMBER ME,
SPARKY?

10:06.272 --> 10:09.508
LOOK, I HAVE THE TRICK DICE
YOU GAVE ME.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.282
- TIMMY, IT'S YOU!

10:16.349 --> 10:18.117
both: SHATZEE!

10:20.152 --> 10:21.954
- NICE TRY, MR. CROCKER.

10:22.021 --> 10:25.091
BUT SPARKY IS MY DOG
AND ALWAYS WILL BE.

10:25.157 --> 10:27.593
YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR TRYING
TO TAKE HIM AWAY.

10:27.660 --> 10:29.528
- I ALREADY PAID 400
TO RENT THE ICE CREAM TRUCK

10:29.595 --> 10:31.063
AND THIS STUPID COSTUME.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.298
I'M KINDA TAPPED OUT.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.333
- THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF PAY
I MEAN.

10:37.903 --> 10:39.505
GET 'EM BOYS!

10:39.572 --> 10:41.507
- GAH! FLOATING UTENSILS!

10:41.574 --> 10:44.076
WHAT'S NEXT?
A SPATULA CHASING UNDERPANTS?

10:44.143 --> 10:45.945
- [screams]

10:46.012 --> 10:48.014
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
IT IS NEXT.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.449
I WAS ALL OVER THAT!

10:50.516 --> 10:55.454
[screaming]

10:58.891 --> 11:00.793
- WOO-HOO!

11:00.860 --> 11:03.229
- GAH! A PLATE DRIVING
A STATION WAGON!

11:03.295 --> 11:06.265
ODDLY, NOT THE CRAZIEST
PART OF MY DAY. GAH!

11:06.332 --> 11:07.733
- LET'S GO HOME, BOY.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.268
- CAN WE STOP
FOR ICE CREAM FIRST?

11:09.335 --> 11:11.670
THE VAMPIRE
DROPPED HIS WALLET.

11:11.737 --> 11:14.874
- GOOD NEWS, GUYS!
I RESCUED SPARKY FROM CROCKER.

11:14.940 --> 11:17.109
- WE HAVE GOOD NEWS,
TOO, SPORT.

11:17.176 --> 11:20.479
WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
OUR NEW WANDS WERE DELIVERED.

11:20.546 --> 11:22.681
WHERE DID YOU PUT THEM,
COSMO?

11:22.748 --> 11:24.016
- WELL, THEY WERE NEW.

11:24.083 --> 11:25.851
SO OF COURSE
I PUT THEM IN THE BATHTUB.

11:25.918 --> 11:31.323
- AAH! HONEY, YOU MIGHT
WANNA CALL THE PLUMBER!

11:31.390 --> 11:35.661
THIS IS WHAT I GET FOR SHAVING
MY LEGS IN THE TUB!

11:35.728 --> 11:37.329
- IT'S COUNT CREAMERY!

11:54.580 --> 11:57.149
- HEY, SPORT.
- CAN'T TALK. DOING MY HOMEWORK.

11:57.216 --> 11:58.317
- GOOD ONE, TIMMY.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.252
BUT SERIOUSLY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:00.319 --> 12:01.720
- I'M REALLY DOING HOMEWORK.

12:01.787 --> 12:03.722
MY GRADES ARE TANKING,
AND I'VE GOTTA GET THEM UP

12:03.789 --> 12:05.524
BEFORE MY NEXT PROGRESS REPORT.

12:05.591 --> 12:08.527
- OKAY, BUT SERIOUSLY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:08.594 --> 12:10.629
[tires screeching]

12:10.696 --> 12:14.500
- TIMMY, MR. CROCKER'S
UNSUSPECTING VAN JUST PULLED UP.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.036
- [giggling]

12:17.103 --> 12:19.205
- AND A GIANT CAKE
JUST GOT OUT OF IT.

12:19.271 --> 12:21.273
- FINALLY!
SOMETHING NORMAL HAPPENED.

12:21.340 --> 12:22.608
[doorbell rings]

12:24.043 --> 12:27.046
- OOH! OUR HOLIDAY FRUITCAKE
CAME EARLY THIS YEAR.

12:27.113 --> 12:28.614
AND IT'S HUGE!

12:28.681 --> 12:31.417
- I'M NOT A FRUITCAKE!
I'M JUST A LITTLE DIFFERENT!

12:31.484 --> 12:33.853
- MR. CROCKER?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:33.919 --> 12:35.821
- DELIVERING YOUR PROGRESS
REPORT IN PERSON.

12:35.888 --> 12:38.424
YOUR GRADES ARE SO BAD,
THEY TAKE THE CAKE!

12:38.491 --> 12:40.593
GET IT?

12:40.659 --> 12:41.794
OH, COME ON!

12:41.861 --> 12:43.162
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT
BAKING THIS THING!

12:43.229 --> 12:46.899
HERE YOU GO, TURNER.
YOU GOT A "G"!

12:46.966 --> 12:48.300
- DOES THAT STAND FOR GOOD?

12:48.367 --> 12:49.702
- NO! IT STANDS FOR,

12:49.768 --> 12:51.437
"GAH! I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE THAT DUMB!"

12:51.504 --> 12:52.771
[laughs]

12:52.838 --> 12:54.874
THAT'S FUNNY!
AND IT WAS JUST AN AD LIB.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.442
FACE IT, TURNER.

12:56.509 --> 12:59.512
IF YOU DON'T SHAPE UP,
YOU'RE GONNA WIND UP IN...

12:59.578 --> 13:02.081
SUMMER SCHOOL.

13:02.148 --> 13:04.083
THERE WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE THUNDER AND LIGHTNING,

13:04.150 --> 13:05.885
BUT I BLEW
MY BUDGET ON FROSTING.

13:05.951 --> 13:09.155
- SUMMER SCHOOL? NOOOO!

13:09.221 --> 13:10.923
- IT'S NOT SO BAD, TIMMY.

13:10.990 --> 13:13.058
IT'S LIKE CAMP
BUT WITHOUT THE BEE STINGS.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.793
- OH, THERE WILL BE
BEE STINGS.

13:14.860 --> 13:16.929
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
HAVE SAID THAT OUT LOUD.

13:16.996 --> 13:19.565
UNH!

13:21.500 --> 13:23.669
- WE HEARD ABOUT YOUR GRADES,
TIMMY.

13:23.736 --> 13:26.772
- BUT ON THE UPSIDE, I GOT
A SLICE OF MR. CROCKER'S CAKE.

13:26.839 --> 13:28.908
[chomps]
MMM...MMM!

13:28.974 --> 13:31.477
TASTES LIKE SADNESS
WITH A HINT OF WASTED LIFE...

13:31.544 --> 13:33.612
AND COCONUT FLAKES.

13:33.679 --> 13:35.447
NO WAIT.
THAT'S HUMP DANDRUFF.

13:35.514 --> 13:37.216
- I CAN'T GO TO SUMMER SCHOOL,
GUYS.

13:37.283 --> 13:38.617
AND EWWW!

13:38.684 --> 13:40.553
ANYWAY, I'VE BEEN
WORKING REALLY HARD,

13:40.619 --> 13:42.288
AND I THINK
I ACED MY HOMEWORK.

13:42.354 --> 13:44.723
WAIT. WHERE IS MY HOMEWORK?

13:44.790 --> 13:46.425
- [slurps]
I'M EATING IT, TIMMY.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.127
THAT'S WHAT DOGS DO.

13:48.194 --> 13:52.631
LOOK, I MADE ALPHABET SOUP
OUT OF YOUR ENGLISH HOMEWORK.

13:52.698 --> 13:55.201
- DOI-DOI-DOI-DOI-DOI!

13:55.267 --> 13:57.002
- SPRINKLE A LITTLE
HUMP DANDRUFF ON THAT,

13:57.069 --> 13:58.404
AND YOU GOT SOMETHING.

13:58.470 --> 14:00.539
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DESTROYED MY HOMEWORK!

14:00.606 --> 14:03.008
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO IT AGAIN
BEFORE SCHOOL TOMORROW.

14:03.075 --> 14:05.277
I'D HAVE TO BE A SUPER GENIUS
TO DO THAT.

14:05.344 --> 14:09.648
WAIT, THAT'S IT!
I WISH I WAS SUPER SMART!

14:11.150 --> 14:13.485
OW! MY HEAD HURTS.

14:13.552 --> 14:15.521
- THAT'S 'CAUSE YOUR STUPID
PINK HAT'S TOO TIGHT

14:15.588 --> 14:16.989
FOR YOUR GIANT HEAD.

14:17.056 --> 14:18.190
- IT'S NOT MY HAT!

14:18.257 --> 14:19.758
IT'S ALL THIS KNOWLEDGE
IN MY HEAD.

14:19.825 --> 14:24.496
THIS IS SCARY!
I KNOW ALL THESE HORRIBLE FACTS.

14:24.563 --> 14:27.299
LIKE THE CHANCES
OF A METEOR HITTING EARTH!

14:27.366 --> 14:29.201
AND WHAT HOT DOGS
ARE REALLY MADE OF!

14:29.268 --> 14:31.537
[grinding]

14:31.604 --> 14:34.807
CHANGE ME BACK!

14:34.873 --> 14:37.409
FACE IT--I'M JUST GONNA HAVE
TO STAY UP ALL NIGHT

14:37.476 --> 14:39.078
AND DO MY HOMEWORK AGAIN.

14:39.144 --> 14:40.846
WAIT. WHERE ARE MY BOOKS?

14:40.913 --> 14:45.251
- LOOK, I MADE STEAMED
MATH BOOK CHOY.

14:45.317 --> 14:49.388
- DOI-DOI-DOI-DOI-DOI!
- STAY AWAY FROM THE BOOK-CHOY.

14:49.455 --> 14:51.724
THE FIRST CHAPTER
GOES RIGHT THROUGH YOU.

14:51.790 --> 14:52.725
[gurgling]

14:52.791 --> 14:53.892
YAI!

14:53.959 --> 14:56.295
- WELL, KIDS,
I GRADED YOUR HOMEWORK.

14:56.362 --> 14:57.663
AND HERE'S A SHOCKER.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.032
TIMMY TURNER GOT A 92%.

15:00.099 --> 15:02.601
- I DID?
all: WOO-HOO!

15:02.668 --> 15:04.103
- DON'T BE SO QUICK
TO CELEBRATE

15:04.169 --> 15:06.171
WITH YOUR BOISTEROUS
SCHOOL SUPPLIES, TURNER!

15:06.238 --> 15:10.242
UNFORTUNATELY,
YOUR 92 IS--WAIT FOR IT--

15:10.309 --> 15:11.577
AN "F"!

15:11.644 --> 15:13.412
- HOW COULD I FAIL
WITH A 92?

15:13.479 --> 15:15.080
- BECAUSE OF THE BELL CURVE!

15:15.147 --> 15:17.249
EVERYONE IN CLASS
GOT A 93 OR ABOVE,

15:17.316 --> 15:19.652
WHICH MEANS WHEN YOU
AVERAGE OUT THE CLASS GRADE,

15:19.718 --> 15:22.221
YOUR 92 IS AN "F"!

15:22.288 --> 15:24.156
HUH. A GIANT "F"
WAS SUPPOSED TO

15:24.223 --> 15:26.392
FALL FROM THE CEILING
AND CRUSH YOU.

15:26.458 --> 15:27.693
[screams]

15:27.760 --> 15:29.895
- THAT'S NOT FAIR!

15:29.962 --> 15:32.464
- A FAIR IS A PLACE
WHERE THEY JUDGE PIGS, TURNER!

15:32.531 --> 15:34.800
- BUT I WORKED REALLY HARD
ON MY HOMEWORK.

15:34.867 --> 15:37.202
- TALK TO THE HUMP, CHUMP.
THE FACE DOESN'T CARE!

15:37.269 --> 15:38.837
SEE YOU IN SUMMER SCHOOL!

15:38.904 --> 15:41.006
WEAR A BEEKEEPER SUIT
IF YOU WANT TO LIVE.

15:41.073 --> 15:45.110
[evil laugh]

15:45.177 --> 15:47.846
THAT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE A BEEHIVE!

15:47.913 --> 15:49.081
- THIS IS NUTS!

15:49.148 --> 15:50.316
BECAUSE OF THE BELL CURVE,

15:50.382 --> 15:51.784
THE ONLY WAY I CAN
GET A PASSING GRADE

15:51.850 --> 15:54.286
IS IF EVERYONE IN CLASS
WERE STUPIDER THAN ME.

15:54.353 --> 15:55.821
- THAT'S CRAZY, TIMMY.

15:55.888 --> 15:58.424
I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYONE
BEING STUPIDER THAN YOU.

15:58.490 --> 16:03.295
OOH! I'M GONNA PLUCK THE GUM
OFF THE TIRE OF THAT MOVING BUS!

16:03.362 --> 16:04.730
[honking]

16:04.797 --> 16:08.600
[screams]

16:08.667 --> 16:11.103
[chews]
THAT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT.

16:11.170 --> 16:14.173
- GUYS, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
FOR ME TO AVOID SUMMER SCHOOL.

16:14.239 --> 16:17.142
I WISH EVERYONE
WAS STUPIDER THAN ME.

16:17.209 --> 16:20.045
- I DON'T KNOW, SPORT,
THIS WISH COULD BE--

16:20.112 --> 16:22.781
- I KNOW. DANGEROUS,
IRRESPONSIBLE, REGRETTABLE.

16:22.848 --> 16:23.882
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH!

16:23.949 --> 16:25.451
JUST WAVE THE WAND, WOMAN.

16:25.517 --> 16:28.153
I'M NOT GETTING ANY YOUNGER.
OR SMARTER.

16:32.391 --> 16:35.494
AWESOME! NOW EVERYONE
WILL BE SUPER STUPID!

16:35.561 --> 16:37.262
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
IN THESE HOT DOGS,

16:37.329 --> 16:39.264
BUT THEY'RE EVEN BETTER
THAN TIRE GUM.

16:39.331 --> 16:40.499
- POOP POOP.

16:40.566 --> 16:42.634
- [spits] [laughs]
HE SAID, "POOP."

16:42.701 --> 16:45.137
THAT'S HILARIOUS!

16:45.204 --> 16:48.073
SUDDENLY I FIND
TOILET HUMOR HYSTERICAL!

16:48.140 --> 16:49.541
[laughter]

16:49.608 --> 16:52.244
- [evil laugh]

16:52.311 --> 16:56.548
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU OUT
WITH THIS CHAIN SAW, TWERP!

16:56.615 --> 16:58.083
WELL, MY WORK HERE
IS DONE.

16:58.150 --> 17:01.754
NOW I'M GONNA
GO BLOW DRY MY HAIR.

17:01.820 --> 17:04.455
[screams]

17:06.258 --> 17:07.792
- I GOT A NEW HAT!

17:09.428 --> 17:13.065
UNH! GAH! UNH!

17:13.132 --> 17:15.334
TIMMY, THERE SEEMS
TO BE A FORCE FIELD

17:15.401 --> 17:16.667
AROUND THE HOUSE.

17:16.734 --> 17:18.436
- IT'S JUST A DOOR, DAD.

17:21.205 --> 17:24.242
- UNH!
[groans]

17:26.111 --> 17:28.280
OH NO!
THE LAWN IS CRYING.

17:28.347 --> 17:30.182
I MUST'VE SAID SOMETHING
TO UPSET IT.

17:30.249 --> 17:32.951
- BOY, MY PARENTS
SEEM EVEN DUMBER THAN USUAL.

17:33.018 --> 17:35.053
BUT I CAN LIVE WITH THAT
AS LONG AS I DON'T

17:35.120 --> 17:37.389
HAVE TO GO
TO SUMMER SCHOOL.

17:37.456 --> 17:39.825
STRAIGHT "A"s,
HERE I COME!

17:39.892 --> 17:40.993
[class bell rings]

17:41.059 --> 17:42.327
- SORRY I'M LATE, KIDS.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.496
THERE WAS A FORCE FIELD
AROUND THE SCHOOL.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.031
ANYWAY, I GRADED
YOUR TESTS.

17:46.098 --> 17:47.866
TURNER, YOU GOT A 41.

17:47.933 --> 17:49.668
BUT SINCE EVERYONE ELSE
SCORED A 5 OR LESS,

17:49.735 --> 17:52.871
YOU GET AN A-PLUS!

17:52.938 --> 17:54.807
- WOO-HOO!
AND I DIDN'T EVEN STUDY!

17:54.873 --> 17:56.141
- YOU DIDN'T NEED TO!

17:56.208 --> 17:59.745
WITH A 41, YOU SHOULD
BE TEACHING THIS CLASS!

17:59.812 --> 18:00.946
- SO DOES THIS MEAN

18:01.013 --> 18:02.314
I DON'T HAVE
TO GO TO SUMMER SCHOOL?

18:02.381 --> 18:05.083
- OF COURSE YOU DON'T!
NOW HAVE A HOT DOG!

18:05.150 --> 18:06.151
[alarm rings]

18:06.218 --> 18:08.720
DARN IT,
I MADE THE CEILING CRY!

18:12.357 --> 18:15.294
- THIS IS AWESOME!
I'M GETTING STRAIGHT "A"s.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.095
I EVEN GOT AN "A"
ON MY SCIENCE PROJECT,

18:17.162 --> 18:21.066
AND ALL I DID WAS PLUG
A LIGHT BULB INTO A HOT DOG.

18:21.133 --> 18:23.702
- HEY, LOOK.
THAT HOT DOG HAS AN IDEA!

18:23.769 --> 18:25.270
- POOP POOP.

18:25.337 --> 18:27.105
[laughter]

18:27.172 --> 18:29.007
- ALL RIGHT, I'M IN A ROOM
FULL OF IDIOTS.

18:29.074 --> 18:31.777
BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,
I'M DOING GREAT IN SCHOOL.

18:31.844 --> 18:35.914
AND THERE'S NO WAY ANY
OF THIS COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG.

18:35.981 --> 18:38.183
- THIS IS CHET UBETCHA
SAYING POOP-POOP.

18:38.250 --> 18:40.118
SORRY, I JUST
LOVE THAT JOKE.

18:40.185 --> 18:44.456
IN OTHER NEWS, A GIANT MUFFIN
IS HURTLING TOWARD THE EARTH.

18:44.523 --> 18:46.992
SO GRAB YOUR COFFEE CUPS
AND BUTTER KNIVES,

18:47.059 --> 18:50.796
BECAUSE IN ONE HOUR
WE'RE ALL GONNA DIIIIINE!

18:50.863 --> 18:53.966
- OH, NO! THAT'S NOT A MUFFIN.
THAT'S A METEOR!

18:54.032 --> 18:57.536
GUYS, YOU GOTTA POOF IT AWAY!
USE YOUR WANDS!

18:57.603 --> 19:00.772
- THIS ISN'T A WAND.
IT'S A BACKSCRATCHER.

19:00.839 --> 19:02.441
[zapping]

19:02.508 --> 19:05.611
- THAT'S NOT A BACKSCRATCHER!
IT'S A LOLLIPOP.

19:05.677 --> 19:08.881
AI-YEE! MMM.
BURNT TONGUE FLAVOR.

19:08.947 --> 19:10.649
- YOU GUYS ARE USELESS.

19:10.716 --> 19:12.551
I GOTTA WARN EVERYONE
ABOUT THE METEOR.

19:12.618 --> 19:15.354
- OOH! HERE
COMES THE MUFFIN.

19:15.420 --> 19:16.822
- I HOPE IT'S BRAN.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.156
I'VE BEEN FEELING
A LITTLE BACKED UP LATELY

19:18.223 --> 19:19.525
FROM ALL THE HOT DOGS.

19:19.591 --> 19:22.194
- IT'S NOT A MUFFIN!
IT'S A METEOR!

19:22.261 --> 19:25.964
- STOP THE CRAZY TALK, TIMMY.
YOU'LL UPSET THE CRY BABY LAWN!

19:26.031 --> 19:28.400
- WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
I'M THE ONLY ONE SMART ENOUGH

19:28.467 --> 19:30.502
TO STOP THE METEOR
FROM DESTROYING THE EARTH,

19:30.569 --> 19:33.038
AND I'M STILL
GETTING 41s IN MATH.

19:33.105 --> 19:35.774
GOTTA THINK, GOTTA THINK.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.809
WAIT.
WHAT IF I BLEW IT UP?

19:37.876 --> 19:39.945
I WISHED FOR A ROCKET ONCE.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.915
I BET IT'S STILL
IN MY CLOSET.

19:42.981 --> 19:44.616
[screams]

19:44.683 --> 19:46.018
[coughs]

19:46.084 --> 19:49.154
- HI, TIMMY.
- IT'S MOJO, MY TALKING YO-YO.

19:49.221 --> 19:52.224
WHY DID I EVER STOP
PLAYING WITH THIS?

19:52.291 --> 19:53.659
- STOP! I'M GONNA VOMIT!

19:53.725 --> 19:56.828
- OH, RIGHT.
IT HAS MOTION SICKNESS.

19:56.895 --> 19:59.498
HERE IT IS!
MY TALKING ROCKET!

19:59.565 --> 20:01.066
OH NO!
IT'S OUT OF FUEL!

20:01.133 --> 20:02.901
- I'M ALSO AFRAID
OF HEIGHTS.

20:02.968 --> 20:05.137
- AND YOU WONDER
WHY I NEVER PLAY WITH YOU.

20:05.203 --> 20:07.973
- GO EASY ON THE ROCKET.
EVERYONE HAS THEIR PROBLEMS.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.775
- I NEED ALL OF MY TOYS
TO BE QUIET

20:09.841 --> 20:12.077
WHILE I THINK OF SOME WAY
TO FUEL THE ROCKET.

20:12.144 --> 20:15.047
- I THINK THIS HOT DOG
HAS AN IDEA.

20:15.113 --> 20:18.016
- THAT'S IT! IF ONE HOT DOG
CAN POWER A LIGHT BULB,

20:18.083 --> 20:20.052
THEN A THOUSAND
COULD POWER A ROCKET!

20:20.118 --> 20:22.521
BUT WHERE CAN I GET
A THOUSAND HOT DOGS?

20:22.588 --> 20:26.425
- OH, TIMMY! CAN I STORE THESE
THOUSAND HOT DOGS IN YOUR ROOM?

20:26.491 --> 20:27.726
NOW THAT WE'RE
HAVING A BIG MUFFIN,

20:27.793 --> 20:29.261
I DON'T NEED THEM ANYMORE.

20:29.328 --> 20:31.229
- NOT NOW!
I'M TRYING TO THINK.

20:31.296 --> 20:33.699
I MEAN, YES!

20:33.765 --> 20:34.766
YAA!

20:38.303 --> 20:40.739
OKAY, ROCKET,
HERE'S THE LAST HOT DOG.

20:40.806 --> 20:42.908
- YOU KNOW I'M A VEGETARIAN,
RIGHT?

20:42.975 --> 20:44.876
- CHOKE IT BACK,
STUPID ROCKET!

20:44.943 --> 20:46.478
I'M TRYING TO SAVE
THE WORLD HERE!

20:46.545 --> 20:49.881
NOW BLAST OFF ALREADY!

20:49.948 --> 20:51.583

[flatulence]

20:58.890 --> 21:00.025
[crowd whimpering]

21:00.092 --> 21:02.861
- I STOPPED THE METEOR!
I'M A HERO!

21:02.928 --> 21:04.262
- YOU SCARED AWAY
OUR MUFFIN.

21:04.329 --> 21:06.932
YOU'RE A MONSTER!
GET HIM!

21:08.100 --> 21:10.969
- [screams]
- STUPID FORCE FIELD!

21:11.036 --> 21:14.406
- AI-YEE!
THIS BURNT TONGUE FLAVOR

21:14.473 --> 21:16.975
NEVER LOSES ITS DELICIOUS
BLISTERY APPEAL.

21:17.042 --> 21:19.044
- AAH!

21:19.111 --> 21:20.212
- EEE!

21:20.278 --> 21:21.913
- GUYS,
I NEED YOU TO FOCUS.

21:21.980 --> 21:23.615
I'M GONNA SAY SOMETHING
AND WHEN I DO,

21:23.682 --> 21:26.251
I WANT YOU TO SHAKE
YOUR BACKSCRATCHER AND LOLLIPOP.

21:26.318 --> 21:29.621
I WISH EVERYTHING
WAS BACK TO NORMAL.

21:29.688 --> 21:32.457
YOU DIDN'T DO IT.
- YOU DIDN'T SAY "SOMETHING."

21:32.524 --> 21:35.060
- I WISH EVERYTHING
WERE BACK TO NORMAL.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.362
SOMETHING!

21:37.429 --> 21:40.232
OKAY, JUST TO MAKE SURE
THAT WORKED--WANDA,

21:40.298 --> 21:41.800
DO YOU WANT A HOT DOG?

21:41.867 --> 21:43.135
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

21:43.201 --> 21:45.704
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT'S IN THOSE THINGS?

21:45.771 --> 21:47.539
- I CALL DIBS
ON WANDA'S THEN!

21:47.606 --> 21:48.940
- YAY! IT WORKED!

21:49.007 --> 21:51.109
EVERYONE'S SMART AGAIN
EXCEPT COSMO.

21:51.176 --> 21:53.278
WHICH MEANS EVERYTHING'S
BACK TO NORMAL!

21:53.345 --> 21:54.780
[crowd cheering]

21:54.846 --> 21:57.649
- TIMMY'S A HERO!
HE SAVED US FROM THE METEOR!

21:57.716 --> 21:59.685
[cheering continues]

21:59.751 --> 22:01.086
[flatulence]

22:01.153 --> 22:03.455
- I CAN'T STOP!
I'VE HAD TOO MANY HOT DOGS!

22:05.524 --> 22:06.892
AH...

22:06.958 --> 22:08.126
[flatulence]

22:08.193 --> 22:09.361
WHOA!

22:11.196 --> 22:14.266
GOOD NEWS, EVERYONE!
I'M OKAY.

22:14.332 --> 22:15.901

22:15.967 --> 22:18.103
FROM NOW ON,
I'M GONNA LEARN MY LESSONS.

22:18.170 --> 22:21.339
WITHOUT MAGIC.
WAIT. WHERE ARE MY BOOKS?

22:21.406 --> 22:24.509
- HEY EVERYONE!

22:24.576 --> 22:27.179
