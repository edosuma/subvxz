02:34.353 --> 02:36.786
- Please, come forward.
- Thank you.

02:36.788 --> 02:39.590
- These are our special breeds.
- Mm-hmm.

02:39.592 --> 02:40.760
Uh, please.

02:41.460 --> 02:44.364
- Oh, how exciting.
- You, uh...

02:44.896 --> 02:46.399
You will like this.

02:47.633 --> 02:49.636
The breeding program
you see here,

02:49.835 --> 02:52.401
it's finally been successful,

02:52.403 --> 02:56.308
despite the extremely complex
genetic engineering involved.

02:56.875 --> 02:58.841
The aim has been
to create a plant

02:58.843 --> 03:01.778
with a scent
that makes its owner happy.

03:01.780 --> 03:02.879
Oh, really?

03:02.881 --> 03:04.250
Yes, that's right.

03:05.417 --> 03:06.416
In recent years, plant breeding
has increasingly focused

03:06.418 --> 03:09.389
on making plants
more resilient and more durable,

03:09.587 --> 03:11.524
thus more energy efficient.

03:11.757 --> 03:14.590
So, finally, the owner
can go away on holiday for weeks

03:14.592 --> 03:16.025
and the flowers still survive.

03:16.027 --> 03:19.029
However, as a rule,
this kind of engineering

03:19.031 --> 03:22.534
involves a loss of scent;
the flowers don't smell of much.

03:22.901 --> 03:27.373
In our case, we have attempted
to create the opposite.

03:27.705 --> 03:30.840
Um, our aim
was to create a plant

03:30.842 --> 03:33.376
that has to be watered
regularly,

03:33.378 --> 03:35.478
protected from cold and heat,

03:35.480 --> 03:37.714
that wants to be touched
and talked to.

03:37.716 --> 03:39.786
Sounds like hard work.

03:40.286 --> 03:42.018
Precisely. And in return,

03:42.020 --> 03:44.854
the plant emits a scent,
which promotes happiness

03:44.856 --> 03:46.656
as a reward for all that effort.

03:48.693 --> 03:51.328
Moreover, the scent
contains a precursor

03:51.330 --> 03:52.832
for the human hormone oxytocin.

03:53.365 --> 03:56.433
Your body uses this molecule
to produce oxytocin

03:56.435 --> 03:57.537
when the scent is inhaled.

03:58.437 --> 03:59.706
Oxytocin?

04:00.004 --> 04:02.471
It's sometimes called
the "mother-hormone",

04:02.473 --> 04:05.007
it's supposed to initiate
the bond between a mother

04:05.009 --> 04:06.411
and her newborn.

04:06.645 --> 04:07.778
You'll love this plant
like your own child.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.782
We are entering
a new era here.

04:11.015 --> 04:14.953
The first, mood-lifting,
anti-depressant, happy plant,

04:16.387 --> 04:17.723
that's fit for market.

04:18.057 --> 04:20.759
I mean you can imagine
the benefit for humanity

04:20.992 --> 04:23.659
- implicated in this innovation.
- Mm-hmm.

04:23.661 --> 04:26.598
Yes, but will the plants be
fully grown for the flower fair?

04:26.798 --> 04:28.300
There's not much time left.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.666
As a side-effect
to the breeding program,

04:30.668 --> 04:33.769
the plants produce an excess
of the growth hormone Cytokinin.

04:33.771 --> 04:36.843
So, yes, they will be ready
on time for the fair.

04:38.043 --> 04:39.679
What this plant really needs...

04:39.978 --> 04:41.713
is love.

04:52.925 --> 04:54.026
Hey, Joe.

04:55.627 --> 04:57.597
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

05:02.067 --> 05:03.670
I'm sure your mum
will be finished soon.

05:04.769 --> 05:05.704
Yeah.

05:06.939 --> 05:07.874
Whatever.

05:09.774 --> 05:11.443
Hey, cool trainers!

05:28.093 --> 05:30.663
We were in Geography
and she opened her bag, and...

05:32.064 --> 05:34.598
...and she says that she found
a little dead rat in there.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.968
- What?
- Yeah,

05:36.999 --> 05:37.666
and what she says...

05:37.668 --> 05:40.605
She says that she doesn't know
who put it in.

05:48.747 --> 05:49.848
I think he likes you.

05:50.682 --> 05:52.117
- Who?
- Chris.

05:53.451 --> 05:54.519
What?

05:54.952 --> 05:56.688
What makes you think that?

05:57.055 --> 05:58.424
I can see it.

06:02.427 --> 06:03.629
Well, I can't.

06:04.629 --> 06:06.163
Well, that's because
all you can see

06:06.165 --> 06:07.400
are your flowers.

06:12.103 --> 06:13.570
He's smart.

06:13.572 --> 06:15.007
He helps you with your work.

06:15.641 --> 06:18.644
You have the same interests.
He suits you.

06:20.646 --> 06:22.682
Much more than Dad anyway.

06:28.187 --> 06:31.086
Dad would really like you
to spend next weekend with him.

06:31.088 --> 06:32.656
I told him I'd ask you.

06:32.658 --> 06:34.757
Do I have to?

06:34.759 --> 06:36.762
He really wants to see
more of you.

06:36.995 --> 06:38.161
He's so...

06:38.163 --> 06:40.466
...different.

06:40.766 --> 06:41.768
From who?

06:42.634 --> 06:43.636
From you!

06:44.136 --> 06:47.070
- And me!
- So, you'll get to know

06:47.072 --> 06:49.105
something different.
Believe me, Joe,

06:49.107 --> 06:51.778
it will do you good to spend
more time with your father.

06:53.011 --> 06:55.045
So, you'd have more time
for your work?

06:55.047 --> 06:56.048
What?

06:56.682 --> 06:58.117
No. Oh, shit.

06:59.016 --> 07:00.786
Oh, no!

07:04.021 --> 07:05.724
Stop laughing at me, Joe.

07:09.761 --> 07:11.760
I guess there's nothing
to worry about.

07:11.762 --> 07:12.864
Good.

07:13.999 --> 07:16.701
Yeah, the new breeding program
could be a real success.

07:17.069 --> 07:19.205
Anyway, I wouldn't
want to jinx it.

07:23.709 --> 07:26.879
But it does look very promising.

07:28.045 --> 07:29.178
We'll see.

07:29.180 --> 07:30.880
Congratulations.

07:30.882 --> 07:33.519
I mean, you never know
what can happen.

07:35.254 --> 07:36.689
Does that bother you?

07:37.855 --> 07:41.060
No, that's my job.
Handling the unpredictable.

07:41.692 --> 07:44.163
It's what I'm pretty good at,
usually.

07:45.863 --> 07:48.697
Of course, there's always a
way for a mistake to sneak in

07:48.699 --> 07:50.002
that even I can't predict.

07:50.302 --> 07:52.872
I can't control everything,
can I?

07:53.771 --> 07:56.873
After all, I have Joe
to take care of and...

07:56.875 --> 07:57.877
Of course.

07:58.744 --> 08:00.480
That must be quite a burden.

08:02.848 --> 08:04.717
No, well,
I wouldn't call it a burden!

08:05.083 --> 08:07.918
I love my son and I enjoy
spending time with him.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.088
Naturally.

08:09.887 --> 08:11.990
But sometimes, I simply
can't be there for him.

08:12.257 --> 08:14.126
Which does worry me.

08:15.026 --> 08:16.528
What worries you?

08:19.865 --> 08:22.264
Sometimes I'm overcome
by the fear

08:22.266 --> 08:24.269
that something
could happened to Joe.

08:27.271 --> 08:28.875
And I wouldn't be there for him.

08:46.158 --> 08:48.592
My beautiful darling.

08:48.594 --> 08:50.596
Hmm, my Bello.

08:50.962 --> 08:51.963
Stay.

09:04.676 --> 09:06.312
- Hiya.
- Morning.

09:16.187 --> 09:17.889
They're doing fine.

09:20.625 --> 09:24.596
These Flash2 are far stronger
than the Flash1 ever were.

09:25.663 --> 09:27.066
Better give them quite a boost.

09:27.331 --> 09:29.601
I don't want to loss these, too.

09:31.636 --> 09:32.637
You'll see.

09:33.672 --> 09:36.008
They will be viable this time.

09:38.009 --> 09:41.112
We all know how hard it is
to succeed with a new strain.

09:44.783 --> 09:47.620
And the blue
is just perfect.

09:59.163 --> 10:02.067
If these plants prove
to be capable of survival,

10:03.168 --> 10:04.834
we could enter
the production phase

10:04.836 --> 10:05.904
sooner than we thought.

10:22.421 --> 10:23.855
Alice,
do you have a minute?

10:25.923 --> 10:30.826
I just wanted to say
that I feel really... proud

10:30.828 --> 10:32.931
and excited
to be working with you.

10:34.432 --> 10:35.668
Well, um...

10:40.772 --> 10:42.108
Don't expect too much.

10:42.374 --> 10:43.709
No, I'm...

10:44.875 --> 10:46.345
convinced that this plant
is gonna be a huge success.

10:47.111 --> 10:48.246
If you say so.

10:48.746 --> 10:49.881
Would you...

10:50.414 --> 10:53.418
How about, um,
a drink after work?

10:54.385 --> 10:55.855
Oh, um...

10:58.056 --> 10:59.057
Uh...

11:01.726 --> 11:03.261
Uh, no.
I have to run.

11:09.868 --> 11:11.367
Could you finish the logbook?

11:11.369 --> 11:12.969
And double-check the timing
of the grow lamps.

11:12.971 --> 11:14.503
That would be so nice of you.

11:14.505 --> 11:15.440
Sure.

11:18.876 --> 11:20.178
Aye, aye, sir.

11:46.937 --> 11:48.774
Look, what I have for you!

11:50.341 --> 11:51.342
Oh.

11:54.412 --> 11:55.480
Is that allowed?

11:56.514 --> 11:57.449
I mean...

11:57.883 --> 11:59.418
No one has to know.

12:00.317 --> 12:01.453
Do you like it?

12:02.921 --> 12:03.889
Yeah.

12:09.494 --> 12:11.864
- It's really hot in here.
- Yes.

12:12.096 --> 12:13.399
It needs to be warm.

12:15.399 --> 12:17.336
This is a very special breed.

12:19.236 --> 12:21.173
You have to take
good care of it.

12:22.106 --> 12:23.208
Keep it warm.

12:24.009 --> 12:25.110
Talk to it.

12:26.043 --> 12:29.212
- Really?
- Yeah, it's a living being.

12:29.214 --> 12:31.484
It needs attention
and affection.

12:34.119 --> 12:35.821
What's so special about it?

12:36.554 --> 12:38.089
It makes you happy.

12:42.460 --> 12:44.764
What do you say we call him
Little Joe?

12:47.932 --> 12:49.235
Hi, Little Joe.

12:53.171 --> 12:55.174
Hi, Little Joe.

12:55.407 --> 12:56.509
Welcome.

13:14.458 --> 13:15.994
Uh-oh.

13:21.166 --> 13:22.434
Doesn't look good.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.902
Oh, damn. Look at that.

14:07.412 --> 14:09.081
They won't make it.

14:40.177 --> 14:43.148
We designed Little Joe
to be sterile.

14:43.682 --> 14:46.114
So, the pollen
isn't able to produce seeds.

14:46.116 --> 14:48.450
If the pollen falls
on female stigma, it dies

14:48.452 --> 14:50.456
without creating
any sustainable offspring.

14:51.255 --> 14:52.524
We engineered it

14:52.957 --> 14:54.360
so the plants can maximize
production of scent.

14:54.658 --> 14:57.196
Why did it emit pollen
in such quantities?

14:57.696 --> 15:00.563
As if they had a will
of their own.

15:00.565 --> 15:03.299
Perhaps, it's a reaction of the
male plant to its infertility.

15:03.301 --> 15:05.200
Oh. Perhaps, perhaps.

15:05.202 --> 15:08.003
Perhaps you made a mistake
and things got out of control.

15:08.005 --> 15:10.172
And now several
of my Flash2's have died.

15:10.174 --> 15:11.708
I hardly think
that has got anything to do

15:11.710 --> 15:13.209
with Little Joe's pollen.

15:13.211 --> 15:15.210
I mean, Flash1
didn't last long either.

15:15.212 --> 15:17.015
What I'd like to know
is how you did it?

15:17.649 --> 15:20.583
None of us have ever succeeded
in manipulating a plant

15:20.585 --> 15:22.153
to such an extent.

15:23.254 --> 15:26.055
Or perhaps you took
a rather relaxed approach

15:26.057 --> 15:27.293
to the regulations.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.425
Well, there's been
more than enough discussion

15:30.427 --> 15:32.697
about deploying
certain new methods.

15:33.230 --> 15:35.567
And no doubt,
they're extremely efficient.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.100
But as I'm sure you know,

15:38.102 --> 15:40.371
their use has not yet
been approved.

15:42.273 --> 15:44.507
I am well aware
of the controversy

15:44.509 --> 15:46.378
over the new virus vectors.

15:46.745 --> 15:48.947
If that is what
you're hinting at.

15:49.714 --> 15:52.681
Yeah. And naturally,
I used the usual vectors.

15:52.683 --> 15:54.252
But why is it sterile?

15:55.586 --> 15:58.021
Why did you design the plant
to be infertile?

15:58.023 --> 15:59.091
It's not natural.

15:59.524 --> 16:01.523
The ability to reproduce
is what gives

16:01.525 --> 16:03.227
every living being meaning.

16:04.328 --> 16:05.627
Well if you're questioning that,

16:05.629 --> 16:07.066
you're in the wrong profession.

16:10.534 --> 16:12.100
As if it were possible

16:12.102 --> 16:13.770
to prevent a plant
from reproducing itself

16:13.772 --> 16:16.041
and thus ensuring
its own survival.

16:17.241 --> 16:19.610
And this plant
will follow its purpose, too.

16:22.580 --> 16:24.313
What is really important here,

16:24.315 --> 16:26.681
is the possible allergens
in this pollen.

16:26.683 --> 16:28.350
I mean that would be
an absolute gift

16:28.352 --> 16:29.754
to the Greenpeacers.

16:30.254 --> 16:32.991
A genetically engineered plant
spreading unknown allergens.

16:33.424 --> 16:34.258
Hello?

16:35.659 --> 16:38.363
We all wear face masks
until further notice.

16:44.369 --> 16:45.370
Bello.

16:45.669 --> 16:46.604
Bello.

16:47.471 --> 16:49.107
Do you want this?
Do you want this?

16:50.174 --> 16:51.142
Fetch!

16:55.179 --> 16:56.579
Come on, Bello!

16:56.581 --> 16:57.546
Come on!

16:57.548 --> 16:58.681
Yeah!

16:58.683 --> 17:00.519
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

17:01.452 --> 17:03.389
It must be their pollen.

17:08.425 --> 17:09.426
Fuck.

17:15.165 --> 17:16.434
So have a lovely weekend.

17:17.268 --> 17:19.337
And say hi to Joe from me.

17:19.703 --> 17:21.638
Joe isn't home;
he's with his father.

17:22.473 --> 17:24.373
- Oh.
- So...

17:24.375 --> 17:25.778
So, how about a drink tonight?

17:26.742 --> 17:28.376
Oh, I don't know.

17:28.377 --> 17:30.615
You've been working so hard.
We both have.

17:31.115 --> 17:34.153
We could do with a change
of scenery, don't you think?

17:34.853 --> 17:36.255
All right.

17:36.554 --> 17:38.657
Bello has vanished.
I can't find him anywhere.

17:41.425 --> 17:43.162
He's never left me before.

17:45.596 --> 17:47.296
I'm sure he'll turn up.

17:47.298 --> 17:49.268
What if someone's locked him
in the greenhouse?

17:52.436 --> 17:53.638
I'll go and have a look.

17:55.507 --> 17:57.543
You stay here.

18:10.721 --> 18:12.290
- Night.
- Night.

18:26.471 --> 18:27.673
Bello!

18:42.953 --> 18:44.388
Here boy!

19:29.267 --> 19:30.736
Oh!

19:32.002 --> 19:34.772
Oh. Fuck!

20:03.667 --> 20:06.270
Oh, he lives in this house
in the middle of nowhere.

20:06.671 --> 20:08.373
He's a real lone wolf.

20:08.772 --> 20:10.405
And you know what?

20:10.407 --> 20:13.676
Ivan is hyper-allergic
to all sorts of pollen.

20:15.046 --> 20:16.715
Doesn't sound like
your perfect match.

20:19.284 --> 20:20.716
You know,
you really need someone

20:20.718 --> 20:23.018
who's gonna understand
and respect your talent.

20:23.020 --> 20:25.587
If you say so.

20:25.589 --> 20:27.992
But who'll stand up to you,
if necessary!

20:30.928 --> 20:33.298
I think that Joe likes you.

20:33.798 --> 20:37.635
He has this idea that you and I
would be the perfect match.

20:38.769 --> 20:41.306
Yeah, I like Joe too.

20:55.886 --> 20:58.423
I'll get the drinks.

21:34.092 --> 21:37.125
Bello. There you are.

21:39.997 --> 21:41.963
Bello, Bello.

21:44.736 --> 21:46.102
Darling?

21:46.104 --> 21:47.773
Darling, what's the matter?

21:49.906 --> 21:51.942
Bello.

21:52.542 --> 21:54.378
Oh, come to Mummy.

21:55.712 --> 21:57.813
What's wrong?

21:57.815 --> 21:58.884
Bello.

22:05.056 --> 22:07.957
Bello.
Oh, my darling.

22:07.959 --> 22:11.330
My darling.

22:14.932 --> 22:16.801
Bello bit Bella.

22:17.535 --> 22:19.805
I just wanted to stroke him
and...

22:21.672 --> 22:23.442
That dog isn't my Bello.

22:23.907 --> 22:26.644
That can't be. Bello would never
do something like this.

22:26.844 --> 22:28.613
Maybe the dog's sick.

22:29.980 --> 22:31.516
You don't understand.

22:32.784 --> 22:34.052
That is not my dog.

22:53.938 --> 22:55.574
What's the matter with Bella?

22:56.173 --> 22:57.541
She's so...

22:59.477 --> 23:01.209
Maybe I should explain
that Bella...

23:01.211 --> 23:02.944
How should I put it?

23:02.946 --> 23:05.516
She's had psychological issues.

23:06.483 --> 23:07.718
What do you mean?

23:09.086 --> 23:12.656
- She tried to kill herself.
- Oh.

23:14.125 --> 23:16.161
She was on sick leave
for almost a year.

23:16.661 --> 23:17.996
A so-called "burn-out".

23:19.529 --> 23:21.833
And she only returned,
just before you started here.

23:24.669 --> 23:26.201
And Karl took her on
as his assistant,

23:26.203 --> 23:27.571
but it wasn't so easy for her.

23:27.971 --> 23:30.674
Trying to resume work
while being downgraded.

23:33.611 --> 23:35.847
She used to be one
of the best plant breeders here,

23:36.047 --> 23:37.783
and now...

23:41.219 --> 23:42.985
What with the medication
and so on,

23:42.987 --> 23:45.090
she's just not the same person
that she used to be.

23:49.527 --> 23:51.196
Of course,
one shouldn't be prejudiced.

23:52.262 --> 23:54.465
And I would be the last person
to judge her.

23:55.500 --> 23:57.568
Is that why she has
restricted access?

23:58.635 --> 24:00.838
Could I please have
the curry and the rice?

26:19.910 --> 26:22.681
Hi, Little Joe.

26:59.083 --> 27:00.085
Hi.

27:03.019 --> 27:04.855
I'm sorry darling.

27:15.432 --> 27:18.132
<i>Wow.
I can't wait for tonight.</i>

27:18.134 --> 27:19.301
<i>Yes.</i>

27:19.303 --> 27:21.469
Great to see you too, pal.

27:21.471 --> 27:23.471
<i>My work colleagues,
everywhere, yes.</i>

27:23.473 --> 27:25.774
<i>How would you
put a smile on my face?</i>

27:29.145 --> 27:31.046
<i>I can see what you
mean already about...</i>

27:31.048 --> 27:33.148
<i>Is this true, that you write
to Hollywood greats?</i>

27:33.150 --> 27:35.417
<i>Yeah! I do.
I used to, yeah.</i>

27:35.419 --> 27:37.151
<i>And did you get
any response?</i>

27:37.153 --> 27:38.690
<i>Yes, I wrote
to Bob Hope...</i>

27:39.056 --> 27:40.956
<i>...I got an autograph from him.</i>

27:40.958 --> 27:42.490
<i>I wrote to James Stewart...</i>

27:42.492 --> 27:44.663
Let's order some takeaway,
hmm?

27:45.128 --> 27:46.263
I've already eaten.

27:48.098 --> 27:49.097
<i>You wouldn't believe that</i>

27:49.099 --> 27:50.466
<i>from my own experience.</i>

27:50.468 --> 27:51.400
<i>Well, don't write
to me!</i>

27:52.970 --> 27:54.402
<i>Good luck tonight.</i>

27:54.404 --> 27:56.037
<i>Thank you
very much, Steven.</i>

27:56.039 --> 27:57.038
<i>I hope you win
a lot of money.</i>

27:57.040 --> 27:57.675
<i>I hope so too.</i>

28:02.813 --> 28:03.882
Where's Bello?

28:04.347 --> 28:06.084
That wasn't my dog anymore.

28:08.152 --> 28:09.485
What did you...

28:09.487 --> 28:11.022
I had him put down.

28:13.490 --> 28:15.426
That dog was not my dog.

28:18.394 --> 28:19.830
What do you mean?

28:23.067 --> 28:24.134
You'll see.

28:46.123 --> 28:47.125
Alice.

28:48.025 --> 28:49.094
We need to talk.

28:49.960 --> 28:51.129
Please. It's important.

28:51.961 --> 28:52.864
Now?

29:07.178 --> 29:09.981
Bello was like a child to me.

29:10.847 --> 29:13.250
I'm sure you can understand
what that feels like.

29:14.417 --> 29:15.886
To lose a child.

29:17.221 --> 29:19.421
What?
What are you talking about?

29:19.423 --> 29:20.858
Can you imagine that?

29:21.826 --> 29:24.461
Somebody you love.
Joe for example.

29:25.395 --> 29:28.133
One day, Joe isn't Joe anymore.

29:28.464 --> 29:31.935
He looks the same, he even acts
like the same old Joe but...

29:32.970 --> 29:34.038
he isn't Joe.

29:34.505 --> 29:37.038
- Something's changed him.
- Like what?

29:37.040 --> 29:38.242
Little Joe.

29:40.176 --> 29:43.444
At first, I thought
it might've been allergens

29:43.446 --> 29:45.013
in Little Joe's pollen

29:45.015 --> 29:47.082
that triggered a reaction
in Bello.

29:47.084 --> 29:47.986
Well?

29:49.053 --> 29:53.091
The vet did blood tests
before he put Bello down.

29:55.058 --> 29:56.027
Nothing.

29:57.260 --> 29:59.463
No antibodies, no histamines.

30:00.497 --> 30:02.597
He couldn't find
anything unusual.

30:02.599 --> 30:04.535
Well, then maybe
there was nothing wrong.

30:04.934 --> 30:06.336
I really don't think that.

30:06.903 --> 30:09.574
After all, we only ever find
what we're looking for.

30:10.441 --> 30:14.979
The vet said he thought Bello
might have senile dementia.

30:15.546 --> 30:17.582
Well, that sounds
quite reasonable.

30:18.949 --> 30:22.921
I think it's Little Joe's pollen
that's triggered something.

30:25.321 --> 30:27.391
Not an allergy perhaps.

30:28.893 --> 30:30.862
- But something else.
- Like what?

30:31.095 --> 30:32.163
Look here.

30:35.531 --> 30:38.132
The pollen
comes through the nose

30:38.134 --> 30:40.070
onto the olfactory receptors.

30:40.604 --> 30:43.438
And then the olfactory
information goes straight

30:43.440 --> 30:44.843
into the limbic system.

30:45.075 --> 30:46.909
The very part of the brain

30:46.911 --> 30:49.113
where it influences
our feelings,

30:49.346 --> 30:52.317
our behavior, our personalities.

30:53.250 --> 30:57.221
And where that oxytocin of yours
triggers its effect.

30:59.088 --> 31:04.095
Whatever it is that is in that
pollen that changed Bello,

31:05.496 --> 31:07.131
that is where it happened.

31:09.365 --> 31:11.232
Will you please stop blaming
Little Joe

31:11.234 --> 31:13.103
for whatever was wrong
with Bello?

31:13.403 --> 31:15.006
Blame Little Joe?

31:15.673 --> 31:17.642
We're talking about a plant,
aren't we?

31:18.409 --> 31:20.278
If anyone is to blame, it's you.

31:22.346 --> 31:25.650
Haven't you notice
how Chris has changed?

31:26.317 --> 31:27.352
No.

31:28.353 --> 31:30.419
I have the feeling
he's infected too.

31:30.421 --> 31:31.652
Infected?

31:31.654 --> 31:33.191
From Little Joe's pollen.

31:34.325 --> 31:38.096
Chris will defend Little Joe
at any price.

31:38.494 --> 31:41.263
And why shouldn't he?
I will defend Little Joe as well

31:41.265 --> 31:43.101
because I am responsible
for him.

31:45.102 --> 31:46.604
So, you are a good mother.

31:49.272 --> 31:51.375
But which of your children
will you choose?

32:26.442 --> 32:27.610
And could she be right?

32:29.212 --> 32:32.279
Of course not. I did
the genetic engineering myself

32:32.281 --> 32:33.984
and I know what I'm doing.

32:34.550 --> 32:37.654
Fine. Then there's nothing
to worry about.

32:38.454 --> 32:42.225
Your colleague is just imagining
Little Joe changed her dog.

32:43.326 --> 32:45.363
Yeah.
I think she's a little...

32:46.296 --> 32:47.465
unbalanced.

32:48.231 --> 32:50.198
Possibly, your colleague
is projecting

32:50.200 --> 32:53.567
some inner conflicts
onto the outside world,

32:53.569 --> 32:57.471
and, consequently, elements
of her environment strike her

32:57.473 --> 32:59.242
as changed.

32:59.542 --> 33:01.244
Yeah. That must be it.

33:04.048 --> 33:06.084
Chris isn't infected either.

33:07.050 --> 33:08.583
Is that
what your colleague said?

33:08.585 --> 33:12.754
Yes. But he's only trying
to protect the plant.

33:12.756 --> 33:14.422
It's very important to him.

33:14.424 --> 33:15.759
So, he's an ally...

33:16.460 --> 33:17.694
Yeah.

33:19.596 --> 33:20.631
It's just...

33:21.632 --> 33:23.632
I'm not sure if he cares more
for the plant

33:23.634 --> 33:25.066
than he cares for me.

33:25.068 --> 33:26.738
And what about you?

33:28.271 --> 33:29.473
You care for him?

33:30.374 --> 33:32.242
Me? No.

33:32.843 --> 33:34.479
I mean, after all, I have Joe.

33:44.654 --> 33:46.423
What do you think
you're playing at?

33:48.525 --> 33:51.860
Sorry,
I really don't know what...

33:51.862 --> 33:53.694
How could you set out
more of those plants

33:53.696 --> 33:56.133
before the allergy tests
have been evaluated?

33:58.602 --> 33:59.737
I didn't know.

34:04.273 --> 34:05.675
My dear colleague,

34:06.242 --> 34:09.275
perhaps you haven't yet grasped
how we do things here.

34:09.277 --> 34:10.414
But for us,

34:10.746 --> 34:13.380
safety is more important
than success.

34:13.382 --> 34:16.353
I'm certain that
Little Joe's pollen is harmless.

34:16.820 --> 34:19.389
Oh. What makes you so certain?

34:20.724 --> 34:22.791
My son
has a Little Joe at home,

34:22.793 --> 34:26.630
and neither he nor I have shown
any allergic reactions at all.

34:28.498 --> 34:29.664
That's...

34:29.666 --> 34:31.465
Against the rules.

34:31.467 --> 34:33.168
I'm strongly tempted to halt

34:33.170 --> 34:35.768
any further planting
of Little Joe immediately.

34:35.771 --> 34:38.275
But we need to be ready
for the flower fair.

34:39.309 --> 34:40.809
If we miss it this year,

34:40.811 --> 34:43.146
another lab might come up
with a similar idea.

34:44.181 --> 34:45.583
I've already heard rumors.

34:46.483 --> 34:48.719
I really don't think
we can risk any delay.

34:50.420 --> 34:51.521
Very well.

34:53.289 --> 34:55.657
But I assure you,
I will not let those plants

34:55.659 --> 34:58.762
out to public until the tests
have been fully evaluated.

35:07.670 --> 35:08.936
Why didn't you tell me

35:08.938 --> 35:10.774
that you were putting
in new plants?

35:11.942 --> 35:14.842
I don't need this right now.
Karl is already against me.

35:14.844 --> 35:16.713
Just trust me for once.

35:18.414 --> 35:19.717
I know what I'm doing.

35:34.264 --> 35:36.363
<i>Oh yes,
this scent is lovely.</i>

35:36.365 --> 35:37.731
<i>Could get addicted.</i>

35:37.733 --> 35:39.336
<i>Any specific reaction?</i>

35:39.936 --> 35:41.702
<i>All fine.</i>

35:41.704 --> 35:43.604
<i>No itchy nose,
skin rashes, runny eyes,</i>

35:43.606 --> 35:44.905
<i>swelling
of the mucous membranes?</i>

35:44.907 --> 35:45.909
<i>Nothing.</i>

35:46.476 --> 35:47.876
<i>Very well then...</i>

35:47.878 --> 35:49.646
<i>If I could just
say something.</i>

35:50.780 --> 35:52.581
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

35:52.583 --> 35:57.521
<i>Well, recently,
she's been... moody I suppose.</i>

35:57.753 --> 35:59.019
<i>Yeah. When I'm talking to her,</i>

35:59.021 --> 36:01.192
<i>she's thinking about something
completely different.</i>

36:02.358 --> 36:03.561
<i>Tell him what
you told me, Ella.</i>

36:04.293 --> 36:06.730
<i>It's like I was a person</i>

36:07.530 --> 36:10.731
<i>in a play or a film.</i>

36:10.733 --> 36:13.603
- <i>What person?</i>
- <i>I don't know.</i>

36:15.405 --> 36:17.871
<i>Me, of course.
I'm playing myself.</i>

36:17.873 --> 36:19.541
<i>That's the strange feeling.</i>

36:19.543 --> 36:21.575
<i>Okay. And how long
did that feeling last?</i>

36:21.577 --> 36:23.181
<i>I don't know...</i>

36:23.547 --> 36:25.849
- <i>for ages.</i>
- <i>No, not really darling.</i>

36:27.284 --> 36:28.519
<i>Started...</i>

36:31.887 --> 36:34.822
<i>The scent was fantastic.</i>

36:34.824 --> 36:37.925
<i>It made me feel sort of,
uh, happy.</i>

36:37.927 --> 36:39.728
Everything okay
with the interviews?

36:39.730 --> 36:41.528
<i>I walked with my head
in the clouds...</i>

36:41.530 --> 36:42.699
Yes. Fine.

36:44.333 --> 36:45.902
The reactions
seem pretty average.

36:47.403 --> 36:49.574
Are you looking for anything
in particular?

36:50.474 --> 36:54.642
No. I just wanted to be sure,
what with Karl being after me.

36:54.644 --> 36:56.614
Hmm. I get it.

36:58.047 --> 37:00.414
Ric, is this all the material?

37:00.416 --> 37:02.286
I mean, are these
the full interviews?

37:03.052 --> 37:04.885
No. Of course not.

37:04.887 --> 37:08.625
They just babbled on and on
so I had to edit.

37:10.427 --> 37:11.429
I see.

37:19.835 --> 37:21.438
Yeah. Well done.

37:22.072 --> 37:23.340
Great.

37:30.480 --> 37:32.682
So, how are things at school?

37:34.918 --> 37:36.586
Yeah. Fine.

37:37.586 --> 37:41.626
What about the other kids?
I mean, are they cool?

37:44.360 --> 37:46.364
- Yeah.
- Good.

37:51.501 --> 37:52.637
That's very good.

37:57.907 --> 38:00.710
And girls? Anyone special?

38:04.880 --> 38:06.983
Listen,
we hardly ever see each other.

38:07.483 --> 38:09.819
So, come on. Hmm?

38:10.887 --> 38:12.323
Is there a girl?

38:16.559 --> 38:18.596
No. Not really.

38:23.032 --> 38:24.301
Sort of.

38:25.702 --> 38:26.737
Great.

38:28.105 --> 38:30.307
Thanks. Want to come in?

38:30.507 --> 38:32.710
- No.
- Okay.

38:34.010 --> 38:35.346
Hey.

38:37.114 --> 38:39.046
Look.

38:39.048 --> 38:40.518
- Please.
- I caught it myself.

38:41.617 --> 38:43.985
I can cook it in the oven.
Dad taught me how.

38:43.987 --> 38:46.389
Sure. Yeah, let's do that.

38:46.590 --> 38:49.393
Cook something in the oven
for once. Great.

38:54.030 --> 38:55.700
So, how was the weekend?

38:59.536 --> 39:00.804
Joe is...

39:01.438 --> 39:02.606
He's changing.

39:03.539 --> 39:05.375
I don't know how to put it.

39:06.476 --> 39:08.579
He's not the boy
he used to be anymore.

39:09.913 --> 39:13.416
- What do you mean?
- You haven't noticed anything?

39:40.710 --> 39:41.644
Joe?

39:43.847 --> 39:46.617
You know that your dad wants
you to go and live with him.

39:48.452 --> 39:49.453
So?

39:51.822 --> 39:53.124
Well, so...

39:54.858 --> 39:55.993
is that what you want?

39:58.594 --> 39:59.829
What about you?

40:01.530 --> 40:02.666
Me?

40:03.666 --> 40:06.403
Of course I want you
to stay here with me.

40:15.211 --> 40:16.447
Mm!

40:17.146 --> 40:18.748
Really good, Joe.

40:27.990 --> 40:31.094
So, are you still up for a movie
this weekend?

40:31.862 --> 40:34.932
Oh. I'm sorry. I have to work.

40:36.565 --> 40:37.567
Whatever.

40:40.036 --> 40:41.137
After the fair?

40:42.706 --> 40:43.774
I promise.

42:33.349 --> 42:34.552
Hi.

42:39.356 --> 42:40.558
Come on.

42:55.838 --> 42:56.940
Cool.

43:34.143 --> 43:35.244
Wait.

43:45.688 --> 43:48.358
Whoa.
It's really hot in here.

43:49.759 --> 43:51.061
The Little Joes need it.

43:52.061 --> 43:53.230
They're very sensitive.

44:06.076 --> 44:07.411
Smells sexy.

44:18.121 --> 44:19.823
You have to talk to them.

44:21.925 --> 44:23.127
Did you know that?

44:30.166 --> 44:31.802
And do they talk back?

44:43.512 --> 44:44.815
Watch out.

45:52.916 --> 45:54.151
That tickles.

45:58.588 --> 46:00.290
I hope I don't get hay fever.

46:01.858 --> 46:02.860
You won't.

46:12.869 --> 46:14.471
There. See that?

46:17.407 --> 46:19.076
Rewind it, will you?

46:19.608 --> 46:22.179
I didn't notice
it at first, either.

46:30.987 --> 46:33.588
Sorry, I really don't know
what you're talking about.

46:33.590 --> 46:35.092
The plants, of course.

46:35.490 --> 46:38.061
When the camera comes back,
one of them has gone.

46:40.329 --> 46:41.331
Oh, there.

46:45.434 --> 46:48.371
Someone clearly knew his way
around the surveillance system.

46:49.539 --> 46:52.242
But what would be the point
of stealing a plant?

46:53.909 --> 46:56.376
The cameras are only there
to monitor growth.

46:56.378 --> 46:58.347
Industrial espionage, maybe.

47:01.251 --> 47:02.986
Let's not get carried away.

47:04.019 --> 47:06.923
I mean, those plants
aren't that special after all.

47:30.079 --> 47:31.949
You're starting to notice
too, aren't you?

47:32.148 --> 47:34.180
Please don't.
I'm not like you.

47:34.182 --> 47:35.117
Oh, no?

47:36.119 --> 47:38.255
Then why are you standing here
talking to me?

47:40.255 --> 47:41.157
I...

47:41.423 --> 47:43.159
We don't have much time.

47:44.159 --> 47:46.395
I think I understand now
what's going on.

47:47.230 --> 47:50.132
Little Joe is infecting people
in order to reproduce.

47:52.201 --> 47:53.534
He's trying to survive.

47:53.536 --> 47:55.536
It's his response
to being sterile.

47:55.538 --> 47:57.074
Isn't that incredible?

47:57.940 --> 47:59.342
It's complete nonsense.

48:00.443 --> 48:03.411
Little Joe changes
the people he infects,

48:03.413 --> 48:06.416
so they will protect
and propagate him.

48:08.217 --> 48:09.983
They care for Little Joe

48:09.985 --> 48:12.221
more than they care
for anyone else.

48:13.989 --> 48:16.459
They will force us
to inhale the pollen.

48:17.327 --> 48:20.898
Our only chance might be
if we pretend.

48:21.264 --> 48:23.532
- Pretend what?
- That nothing is happening.

48:24.967 --> 48:26.335
But nothing is happening.

48:28.204 --> 48:29.940
I know you didn't want this.

48:35.577 --> 48:37.346
But it is really happening.

48:56.766 --> 48:57.968
Joe?

49:14.317 --> 49:15.952
<i>If I could just say something.</i>

49:16.753 --> 49:18.418
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

49:18.420 --> 49:22.690
<i>Well, recently
she's been... moody...</i>

49:26.795 --> 49:28.795
<i>Okay. And how long
did that feeling last?</i>

49:28.797 --> 49:30.166
<i>I don't know.</i>

49:31.233 --> 49:33.036
- <i>For ages.</i>
- <i>No, not really, darling.</i>

49:34.137 --> 49:36.470
<i>It started exactly on the day</i>

49:36.472 --> 49:38.307
<i>she did the pollen test,
for you.</i>

49:40.175 --> 49:42.278
- <i>I don't know why we did it.</i>
- <i>For the money.</i>

49:43.579 --> 49:45.615
<i>We said that
she could buy a bike.</i>

49:46.148 --> 49:48.451
<i>It's not really as though
we can afford to buy a bicycle.</i>

49:49.619 --> 49:52.753
- <i>We thought it was harmless.</i>
- <i>And it is, okay?</i>

49:52.755 --> 49:54.691
- <i>So please don't worry.</i>
- <i>Don't worry?</i>

49:55.625 --> 49:58.092
<i>Well, my daughter doesn't
respond to her own name,</i>

49:58.094 --> 49:59.626
<i>doesn't recognize me when
I collect her</i>

49:59.628 --> 50:01.128
- <i>from her flute lesson</i>
- <i>Mummy, I told you,</i>

50:01.130 --> 50:02.666
<i>I wasn't wearing my glasses.</i>

50:03.065 --> 50:04.067
<i>Be quiet.</i>

50:07.170 --> 50:08.536
<i>Well, I really don't know</i>

50:08.538 --> 50:10.273
<i>what my husband
is trying to say.</i>

50:10.472 --> 50:12.342
<i>I'm absolutely fine.</i>

50:13.509 --> 50:15.277
<i>That's exactly the problem.</i>

50:15.811 --> 50:18.345
<i>She used to complain about me
all the time.</i>

50:18.347 --> 50:20.648
<i>Nothing was ever good for her.</i>

50:20.650 --> 50:22.452
<i>But I knew she loved me.</i>

50:22.818 --> 50:26.556
<i>Now, she couldn't be
nicer to me, but...</i>

50:27.123 --> 50:29.025
<i>Because you deserve it, Harry.</i>

50:32.260 --> 50:34.364
<i>I don't know
this woman anymore.</i>

50:34.764 --> 50:36.365
<i>This isn't my wife.</i>

50:37.833 --> 50:41.735
<i>My God! Please, don't take
my husband seriously.</i>

50:41.737 --> 50:44.441
<i>If we just could get back
to the allergic reactions?</i>

51:05.827 --> 51:08.465
- Parents.
- But when do they finish?

51:09.164 --> 51:11.664
Um, midnight,
but I have to sleep by 11:00.

51:11.666 --> 51:14.869
- That sucks.
- Yep.

51:14.871 --> 51:16.871
Yeah, at least
you got to go.

51:16.873 --> 51:18.407
Yeah, I guess.

51:19.442 --> 51:21.277
- You missed it.
- What?

51:22.512 --> 51:24.211
Ah, it was sick.

51:24.213 --> 51:26.550
Like, oh, my God,
it was actually really good.

51:27.617 --> 51:29.753
Who's there? Um...

51:31.521 --> 51:32.522
Mum?

51:36.826 --> 51:38.494
Oh, I didn't know...

51:40.730 --> 51:42.865
Good evening, Mrs. Woodard.

51:44.400 --> 51:49.506
Mum, this is Selma.
We're doing a project together.

51:50.273 --> 51:51.041
Lovely.

51:51.806 --> 51:55.478
Hello, Selma.
So, you're classmates?

51:56.179 --> 51:57.414
That's right.

51:58.280 --> 51:59.181
Right.

52:00.750 --> 52:02.485
Would you like to stay
for dinner?

52:02.851 --> 52:04.520
Oh, yes, please.

52:05.487 --> 52:06.856
Well, then I...

52:08.724 --> 52:10.327
Shouldn't you tell
your parents?

52:11.494 --> 52:12.496
Sure.

52:19.534 --> 52:20.569
Hi, Dad.

52:21.804 --> 52:25.142
Joe's mum wants me to tell you
I'm staying here for dinner.

52:34.217 --> 52:36.186
This is delicious,
Mrs. Woodard.

52:37.253 --> 52:38.588
Please call me Alice.

52:38.954 --> 52:40.356
It's just the takeaway.

52:40.690 --> 52:42.259
I'm not much of a cook.

52:42.657 --> 52:44.161
But thanks anyway.

52:45.661 --> 52:47.695
I'm glad that you invited
somebody over.

52:47.697 --> 52:49.599
I hardly know any
of Joe's friends.

52:49.798 --> 52:52.434
Oh, I am sorry.

52:53.469 --> 52:54.704
Well, of course,

52:55.871 --> 52:57.403
a boy doesn't have to discuss
everything with his mum.

52:58.840 --> 53:01.577
I suppose Joe spends more time
with his father?

53:02.545 --> 53:05.347
No, he's mostly here with me.

53:05.715 --> 53:07.617
Joe's father
lives out in the wilds.

53:08.416 --> 53:10.719
I know, I've been there.

53:11.519 --> 53:12.521
What?

53:12.922 --> 53:15.824
Yes, Selma came with me once.

53:16.025 --> 53:19.396
Yes, it was really wonderful.
I love the countryside.

53:20.429 --> 53:22.666
That's unusual for a teenager.

53:23.498 --> 53:24.299
Why?

53:26.635 --> 53:28.001
Joe, there's something
that I wanted

53:28.003 --> 53:29.538
to discuss with you.

53:30.572 --> 53:32.975
- My plant house keycard?
- That's funny.

53:33.976 --> 53:36.677
I also wanted to discuss
something with you too.

53:36.679 --> 53:37.681
Yes?

53:39.547 --> 53:41.217
Well, see...

53:42.952 --> 53:44.952
you're always so busy
with work

53:44.954 --> 53:47.787
and I guess it must be
really tiring for you

53:47.789 --> 53:49.423
taking care of me as well.

53:49.425 --> 53:51.228
What? Who says so?

53:51.427 --> 53:52.429
Ivan?

53:52.762 --> 53:53.763
No.

53:54.896 --> 53:56.664
You don't notice,

53:56.666 --> 53:58.831
but usually I'm here
all by myself,

53:58.833 --> 54:02.571
and recently I've been getting
on really well with Dad.

54:04.539 --> 54:05.808
Just been thinking.

54:06.909 --> 54:08.979
I do want to live with him,
after all.

54:13.481 --> 54:16.786
That's out of the question!
I simply won't allow it.

54:20.322 --> 54:21.324
See?

54:22.090 --> 54:23.659
I knew you'd say that.

54:25.427 --> 54:26.962
This is how you will
get rid of me.

54:27.963 --> 54:29.599
It's your own fault.

54:31.032 --> 54:33.836
Come on, we're going.

54:35.070 --> 54:36.603
Wait, please.

54:36.605 --> 54:37.606
Joe!

54:38.807 --> 54:40.574
- Please!
- Let go!

54:40.576 --> 54:41.978
You're hurting me.

54:56.625 --> 54:57.860
I'll get a plaster.

55:08.471 --> 55:09.972
Can I help you, Mrs. Woodard?

55:10.806 --> 55:12.509
No, it's all right.

55:31.059 --> 55:32.762
I think it does talk back.

55:34.463 --> 55:35.695
I told you.

55:35.697 --> 55:37.533
It's a very special plant.

55:58.686 --> 56:00.489
What happened to your ants?

56:02.791 --> 56:04.893
I can't take care
of everything around here.

56:27.817 --> 56:28.818
Fuck.

56:32.521 --> 56:34.724
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

56:36.458 --> 56:37.460
Fuck!

56:47.836 --> 56:49.903
If you didn't know
how to handle the thermostat,

56:49.905 --> 56:52.008
- you just had to ask.
- Oh, come on.

56:52.807 --> 56:55.541
I've been a plant breeder here
for 20 years.

56:55.543 --> 56:56.411
Of course, you have.

56:57.847 --> 56:59.646
Just next time I'll be
better off doing it

56:59.648 --> 57:01.885
all by myself, I think.

57:04.820 --> 57:06.823
- I think she did it on purpose.
- All right.

57:07.590 --> 57:09.889
Bella, I'm sorry.
Ric doesn't mean it like that.

57:09.891 --> 57:12.027
I mean, you're one
of our best breeders.

57:12.561 --> 57:14.963
Oh, please save your breath.

57:15.998 --> 57:17.766
I know
what you think of me.

57:19.568 --> 57:20.970
I can see through you.

57:23.606 --> 57:25.508
I know what's going on here.

57:48.664 --> 57:51.801
Bella's theories
are completely crazy.

57:52.800 --> 57:54.034
Not that I'm prejudiced.

57:54.036 --> 57:55.202
- I'd be...
- The last person

57:55.204 --> 57:56.773
to have such a prejudice.

57:57.873 --> 57:59.909
Right, stop looking at me
as if I were a zombie.

58:00.175 --> 58:01.742
I've had enough!

58:01.744 --> 58:04.113
I'm... I'm sorry.
Of course you're right.

58:04.813 --> 58:07.050
The whole thing is ridiculous.

58:11.920 --> 58:13.787
I just don't understand
why you're worried.

58:13.789 --> 58:14.924
I mean, it worked well.

58:15.623 --> 58:18.227
Perhaps it worked too well.

58:19.894 --> 58:22.695
Perhaps the plant isn't only
making people happy

58:22.697 --> 58:25.701
but it's actually infecting
people's brains.

58:26.902 --> 58:27.903
What?

58:29.338 --> 58:31.037
What if we made a mistake?

58:31.039 --> 58:33.106
and then something went wrong
with the R-virus

58:33.108 --> 58:34.744
during gene transfer?

58:35.844 --> 58:36.813
Like what?

58:37.914 --> 58:41.918
What if the virus mutated
and it became pathogenic?

58:42.885 --> 58:44.650
Wow.

58:44.652 --> 58:46.052
I mean, are you serious?

58:46.054 --> 58:47.757
Cytokinin could have caused
a mutation.

58:48.856 --> 58:50.893
Hang on, let me
get this straight.

58:51.594 --> 58:52.961
You're suggesting

58:53.161 --> 58:56.598
that this harmless
little R-virus vector

58:56.998 --> 59:01.637
has mutated into a human
pathogenic virus

59:01.836 --> 59:03.172
that infects people's brains?

59:05.273 --> 59:08.641
What in the world could cause
that to happen?

59:08.643 --> 59:10.012
Little Joe.

59:10.311 --> 59:11.979
I mean, what if Bella's right
and this is how the plant

59:11.981 --> 59:13.950
is trying to overcome
its sterility?

59:14.916 --> 59:16.983
By infecting people's brains?

59:16.985 --> 59:18.954
By using the R-virus to do it.

59:19.887 --> 59:21.787
We never should've made
Little Joe sterile,

59:21.789 --> 59:24.791
- It is unnatural, after all.
- No, it's vital!

59:24.793 --> 59:26.726
That's what makes genetic
engineering safe.

59:26.728 --> 59:28.061
That we don't let our plants
propagate

59:28.063 --> 59:29.695
into nature uncontrolled.

59:29.697 --> 59:31.097
You sound like
a promotional clip.

59:31.099 --> 59:32.268
You believe that?

59:33.335 --> 59:34.133
Well, of course, there are
other benefits, such as

59:34.135 --> 59:36.202
the commercial use
of the plant.

59:36.204 --> 59:38.338
- See?
- But that's okay.

59:38.340 --> 59:40.340
Well, maybe Little Joe
doesn't think it's okay.

59:40.342 --> 59:43.146
Little Joe doesn't think
at all.

59:44.112 --> 59:47.079
Listen, if you go around
telling people

59:47.081 --> 59:49.916
that we may have some sort of
human pathogenic virus

59:49.918 --> 59:52.755
in our plant,
our careers are over!

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:11.807
So, you do think
that it could happen?

01:00:12.141 --> 01:00:14.840
- No, I don't.
- Perhaps that's exactly

01:00:14.842 --> 01:00:15.744
what happened.

01:00:16.679 --> 01:00:20.313
So, now, we're dealing
with a super virus

01:00:20.315 --> 01:00:22.682
that infects people
so that all they care about

01:00:22.684 --> 01:00:24.351
is the reproduction
of Little Joe.

01:00:24.353 --> 01:00:26.219
But at the same time
you don't notice

01:00:26.221 --> 01:00:29.057
because the infected people act
exactly as they did before.

01:00:29.257 --> 01:00:31.023
And they're deceptively good
at it.

01:00:31.025 --> 01:00:32.260
Sounds very plausible.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:33.762
Bravo!

01:00:36.431 --> 01:00:40.733
Alice, don't you think
that these "changes"

01:00:40.735 --> 01:00:42.638
that Little Joe is supposed
to cause

01:00:42.838 --> 01:00:45.307
could be happening for
completely different reasons?

01:00:49.244 --> 01:00:51.014
I'm just so worried about Joe.

01:00:52.313 --> 01:00:54.481
I just don't know him anymore.
We were so close

01:00:54.483 --> 01:00:55.818
and now he's...

01:00:56.184 --> 01:00:58.186
Well, Joe is growing up.

01:00:58.786 --> 01:01:01.088
It's completely normal
for him to change.

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:02.392
He wants to move in with Ivan.

01:01:03.125 --> 01:01:04.793
What would I do without him?

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.362
Well, I could talk to him,

01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:09.331
if you like.

01:01:55.277 --> 01:01:56.479
I have to go.

01:01:56.878 --> 01:01:58.278
All right. Cool.

01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:59.845
- See you later.
- See you later.

01:01:59.847 --> 01:02:00.849
All right.

01:02:32.347 --> 01:02:33.345
Hi, mum.

01:02:33.347 --> 01:02:34.516
I didn't see you.

01:02:47.496 --> 01:02:50.162
So I decided to take
the weekend off.

01:02:50.164 --> 01:02:52.934
We can go to an exhibition
or a movie?

01:02:55.036 --> 01:02:56.772
I'm already
doing something.

01:03:02.177 --> 01:03:04.010
It's like I barely know
you anymore.

01:03:04.012 --> 01:03:05.481
You never tell me
what you're up to.

01:03:11.853 --> 01:03:14.022
I don't have to discuss
everything with you.

01:03:15.257 --> 01:03:19.228
Mum, please,
this is normal at my age.

01:03:41.483 --> 01:03:42.485
Bella.

01:03:46.054 --> 01:03:48.088
I have a huge favor
to ask you.

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:48.958
I'm...

01:03:49.157 --> 01:03:51.023
I need to leave early today.

01:03:51.025 --> 01:03:54.230
My girlfriend
has had an accident.

01:03:54.896 --> 01:03:57.232
She is in hospital right now.

01:03:57.565 --> 01:03:59.034
- and...
- What do you want?

01:04:00.402 --> 01:04:02.405
Could you do
the nutrient feed for me?

01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:04.106
Please?

01:04:11.246 --> 01:04:12.181
Fine.

01:04:13.014 --> 01:04:14.016
Thank you.

01:04:18.686 --> 01:04:20.686
The access code is "fromage".

01:04:20.688 --> 01:04:23.024
F- R-O-M-A-G-E.

01:04:23.692 --> 01:04:24.994
Thanks, Bella.

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:14.099
Hello?

01:07:42.724 --> 01:07:43.826
Bella?

01:07:50.297 --> 01:07:51.266
How are you?

01:07:51.465 --> 01:07:52.300
Why?

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:54.800
Well, you seemed,
how should I say,

01:07:54.802 --> 01:07:57.205
- quite concerned lately.
- Oh, that?

01:07:57.639 --> 01:07:59.407
That's all over, I'm fine.

01:08:00.275 --> 01:08:01.610
I'm sorry I frightened you.

01:08:02.610 --> 01:08:05.413
I realize now that it was
all in my mind.

01:08:06.481 --> 01:08:09.752
I'm not sure if you know
but I used to be ill.

01:08:10.818 --> 01:08:12.353
Mentally ill.

01:08:13.188 --> 01:08:14.554
Sometimes,
my illness comes back

01:08:14.556 --> 01:08:16.255
and I'm not myself anymore.

01:08:16.256 --> 01:08:18.725
Anyway, if I take my medication,
everything's fine.

01:08:20.761 --> 01:08:22.331
That's how it is.

01:08:24.265 --> 01:08:25.567
But, Bello...

01:08:29.569 --> 01:08:31.603
Really. You don't have to worry.

01:08:31.604 --> 01:08:33.406
Little Joe
is completely harmless.

01:08:33.408 --> 01:08:35.375
I inhaled some
of the pollen myself.

01:08:35.377 --> 01:08:36.709
and I'm just fine.

01:08:36.711 --> 01:08:38.443
Little Joe
couldn't harm anybody.

01:08:38.444 --> 01:08:39.247
How can you be sure?

01:08:40.215 --> 01:08:42.649
It's just a plant
trying to survive.

01:08:57.731 --> 01:09:00.200
Sorry, I don't see
an appointment for you today.

01:09:00.202 --> 01:09:01.904
I know.
But it's important.

01:09:03.703 --> 01:09:05.707
This is most irregular.

01:09:14.849 --> 01:09:16.618
Well, I'm no biologist.

01:09:16.917 --> 01:09:18.252
What can I say?

01:09:20.421 --> 01:09:22.390
What would the consequences be?

01:09:23.625 --> 01:09:24.792
We don't know.

01:09:26.795 --> 01:09:28.898
We really don't know
what a virus like that could do.

01:09:29.796 --> 01:09:31.533
Well, neither do I.

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:37.372
So, your colleague, Bella?

01:09:38.273 --> 01:09:39.707
Might be right after all?

01:09:41.274 --> 01:09:42.042
Yeah.

01:09:42.609 --> 01:09:44.876
No. She's changed her mind
recently,

01:09:44.877 --> 01:09:47.349
but I think that's because
she's been infected too.

01:09:49.582 --> 01:09:50.752
Just like Joe.

01:09:51.586 --> 01:09:52.818
Joe?

01:09:52.819 --> 01:09:54.422
It sounds so crazy.

01:09:55.957 --> 01:09:57.426
But it's as if...

01:10:01.395 --> 01:10:03.666
Joe weren't Joe anymore.

01:10:04.798 --> 01:10:06.467
He frightens me.

01:10:07.801 --> 01:10:09.971
Let's remember Bella's dog.

01:10:11.773 --> 01:10:13.473
In our last session,

01:10:13.475 --> 01:10:16.808
you spoke about how Bella
stopped loving her dog

01:10:16.810 --> 01:10:19.247
because she thought
it had changed.

01:10:20.047 --> 01:10:21.951
She had it put down, right?

01:10:23.752 --> 01:10:25.287
Is it possible,

01:10:25.619 --> 01:10:27.789
Bella prompted
certain fears in you?

01:10:28.789 --> 01:10:31.627
Fears connected
with the loss of your son.

01:10:33.595 --> 01:10:36.595
Fear can distort
our perception of reality

01:10:36.597 --> 01:10:40.903
until we actually see
what we are afraid of...

01:10:42.069 --> 01:10:44.706
or what we secretly
wish for.

01:10:46.908 --> 01:10:48.344
Wish for?

01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:50.878
What wish would that be?

01:10:55.449 --> 01:10:59.887
Patient Woodard, Alice:
workaholic,

01:11:00.488 --> 01:11:01.789
feelings of guilt

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:05.828
centered on perceived
neglect of pubescent son, Joe.

01:11:16.104 --> 01:11:19.339
Possibly patient is suppressing
her subconscious wish

01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:22.311
to free herself from the bond
with her child.

01:12:34.448 --> 01:12:36.551
I don't even see
what the problem should be.

01:12:37.551 --> 01:12:40.052
Try to make her feel
more needed.

01:12:40.054 --> 01:12:42.888
- That's just how mothers are.
- Yeah.

01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:44.859
Yeah, I also think that...

01:12:46.828 --> 01:12:48.494
Oh, Alice, there you are.

01:12:48.496 --> 01:12:49.961
We were just wondering
what happened to you.

01:12:49.963 --> 01:12:51.399
What are you doing here?

01:12:51.865 --> 01:12:53.402
We're just having a chat.

01:12:53.935 --> 01:12:56.638
Me and Joe
and his girlfriend Selma.

01:12:58.072 --> 01:13:00.005
Is it all right if Chris stays
for dinner?

01:13:00.007 --> 01:13:01.143
No!

01:13:02.743 --> 01:13:03.746
Pity.

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:07.949
What's going on here?

01:13:08.449 --> 01:13:09.484
Nothing.

01:13:10.452 --> 01:13:11.987
Didn't you want me
to speak to Joe?

01:13:14.588 --> 01:13:17.557
Alice, how can you possibly
misunderstand everything?

01:13:17.559 --> 01:13:19.628
Chris, please,
you should leave now.

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:21.563
Alice...

01:13:22.029 --> 01:13:24.966
I don't think you know
how much...

01:13:26.935 --> 01:13:28.067
I...

01:13:28.069 --> 01:13:29.638
I think I love you.

01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:38.113
Chris...

01:13:42.649 --> 01:13:45.186
You know what?
There's nothing wrong with Joe.

01:13:46.654 --> 01:13:48.187
You just have to let him go.

01:13:48.189 --> 01:13:50.692
It's really none
of your business, Joe is my boy.

01:13:51.525 --> 01:13:52.827
Well, I'm just trying to help.

01:13:53.927 --> 01:13:56.597
If there's anyone that's changed
around here, it's you.

01:14:03.971 --> 01:14:05.139
That's not true.

01:14:08.275 --> 01:14:10.112
Joe, please,
I have to talk to you.

01:14:18.786 --> 01:14:21.053
Several things
have happened recently

01:14:21.055 --> 01:14:22.724
that have disturbed me
quite a lot.

01:14:23.557 --> 01:14:25.258
For instance,
what you and Selma

01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:26.862
were doing in the growing hall.

01:14:27.228 --> 01:14:28.831
What are you talking about?

01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:31.533
I've no idea what you mean.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.699
Don't bother lying.

01:14:33.701 --> 01:14:36.137
- Joe, I know you were in there.
- You followed us!

01:14:37.238 --> 01:14:38.539
Mum...

01:14:38.907 --> 01:14:40.175
that's really...

01:14:40.975 --> 01:14:43.846
- How could you do that?
- No! What...

01:14:44.177 --> 01:14:46.180
Why do you think...
of course not.

01:14:51.051 --> 01:14:52.920
We wanted to give Ivan a plant,

01:14:53.887 --> 01:14:54.957
for his birthday.

01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:56.824
He's allergic.

01:14:57.225 --> 01:14:58.494
I know.

01:15:04.332 --> 01:15:06.602
We wanted him to inhale
the pollen, too.

01:15:08.202 --> 01:15:09.704
So, he'd become like us.

01:15:12.573 --> 01:15:13.574
What?

01:15:15.143 --> 01:15:16.278
It's true.

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:20.949
Selma and I have been infected
by Little Joe's pollen.

01:15:23.184 --> 01:15:25.020
What?

01:15:25.886 --> 01:15:26.889
Yes.

01:15:27.956 --> 01:15:29.224
It's funny, but...

01:15:29.923 --> 01:15:31.960
ever since,
I've felt quite happy.

01:15:33.261 --> 01:15:35.697
All of us who have inhaled
the pollen,

01:15:36.363 --> 01:15:37.899
we belong together now.

01:15:39.132 --> 01:15:41.068
And we'll do anything
to help Little Joe.

01:15:43.237 --> 01:15:44.773
That's our job, isn't it?

01:15:48.176 --> 01:15:49.244
Of course,

01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:52.581
it's a pity you feel bad now,
but...

01:15:53.715 --> 01:15:55.250
that's just because
you're not one of us.

01:15:56.717 --> 01:15:57.985
Not yet.

01:15:58.886 --> 01:15:59.988
That's right.

01:16:01.021 --> 01:16:03.057
If you inhale the pollen too,
you'll understand.

01:16:03.925 --> 01:16:05.127
It doesn't hurt.

01:16:06.027 --> 01:16:07.828
You'll hardly notice
the difference.

01:16:08.895 --> 01:16:11.899
No one does. Not even us.

01:16:12.766 --> 01:16:16.572
We pretend to be the same
as before and it works.

01:16:17.372 --> 01:16:19.074
It's a kind of reflex.

01:16:20.875 --> 01:16:22.176
And it makes you feel happy.

01:16:23.944 --> 01:16:25.813
Which is what you wanted,
right?

01:16:26.279 --> 01:16:27.280
No.

01:16:27.981 --> 01:16:30.152
Joe, that's impossible.
That's not what I wanted.

01:16:30.917 --> 01:16:32.954
But look, Alice...

01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:36.024
Can I call you Alice?

01:16:36.289 --> 01:16:37.592
Yes.

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:39.627
There's nothing for you
to be afraid of.

01:16:40.494 --> 01:16:43.064
Now, you think something
will be missing,

01:16:43.264 --> 01:16:46.902
but, like I said,
you won't notice.

01:16:49.237 --> 01:16:50.771
It's like being dead.

01:16:51.104 --> 01:16:53.140
You don't notice you're dead,
do you?

01:16:55.309 --> 01:16:56.677
Good comparison.

01:17:07.954 --> 01:17:08.923
Joke.

01:17:09.690 --> 01:17:11.025
It was a joke.

01:17:12.426 --> 01:17:13.628
What?

01:17:14.061 --> 01:17:15.695
Come on, Mum,

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:17.763
you don't really believe
that nonsense, do you?

01:17:17.765 --> 01:17:19.801
It's me, Joe.

01:17:20.001 --> 01:17:22.404
Your Joe.
I'm... I'm fine really!

01:17:22.904 --> 01:17:24.973
And so is Selma.
Right, Selma?

01:17:28.309 --> 01:17:29.177
But...

01:17:29.476 --> 01:17:31.380
what gave you that idea?

01:17:33.247 --> 01:17:35.984
Chris told us a bit
about your problems...

01:17:37.284 --> 01:17:38.987
with Little Joe.

01:17:39.453 --> 01:17:41.188
Seriously, Mum.

01:17:42.189 --> 01:17:45.693
I suppose I have changed a bit
but it's nothing against you.

01:17:46.127 --> 01:17:47.929
It has nothing to do with you.

01:17:50.131 --> 01:17:51.266
I guess I'm growing up

01:17:51.966 --> 01:17:54.903
and I simply want to spend
a bit more time with my father.

01:17:56.037 --> 01:17:57.372
Can you please accept that?

01:18:57.064 --> 01:18:58.133
Joe?

01:19:18.819 --> 01:19:20.421
Oh, Joe.

01:19:24.926 --> 01:19:27.259
I will always love you.

01:19:39.372 --> 01:19:44.278
Karl, I have to confess
that I lied to you all.

01:19:45.246 --> 01:19:46.914
I'm terribly sorry.

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:49.581
I didn't use the usual vectors

01:19:49.583 --> 01:19:53.087
but one of the new
virus vectors. It was, um...

01:19:53.988 --> 01:19:55.987
precisely the ones
that we're not allowed.

01:19:55.989 --> 01:19:57.356
That's how
we were able to modify

01:19:57.358 --> 01:19:59.027
Little Joe's scent so well.

01:20:00.627 --> 01:20:01.862
I see.

01:20:04.431 --> 01:20:05.466
Well...

01:20:06.434 --> 01:20:08.804
that is, of course,
a very serious offense.

01:20:10.104 --> 01:20:11.472
If you want my opinion,

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:14.305
sooner or later,
we are all going to be using

01:20:14.307 --> 01:20:16.243
those new viruses anyway.

01:20:17.878 --> 01:20:19.447
They are pretty efficient,
aren't they?

01:20:20.581 --> 01:20:22.083
Well, yes.

01:20:23.317 --> 01:20:25.183
But I have reason to believe
that the ones that we've used...

01:20:25.185 --> 01:20:27.119
- Which one was it?
- It's the R-virus.

01:20:27.121 --> 01:20:29.120
I have reason to believe
that it has mutated

01:20:29.122 --> 01:20:31.826
and it now has a pathogenic
effect on the human brain.

01:20:33.127 --> 01:20:34.129
Really?

01:20:36.096 --> 01:20:37.898
Has this ever happened before?

01:20:38.265 --> 01:20:39.598
Not that we know of.

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.165
- Well...
- That doesn't mean

01:20:41.167 --> 01:20:42.237
that it didn't happen.

01:20:42.435 --> 01:20:44.171
Maybe just no one dared
to think of it.

01:20:49.143 --> 01:20:50.241
Look.

01:20:50.243 --> 01:20:52.213
What exactly are the symptoms?

01:20:53.146 --> 01:20:55.350
Well, it's not like
they become zombies.

01:20:56.917 --> 01:20:59.183
I believe that
those who are infected,

01:20:59.185 --> 01:21:01.555
they change in a nearly
imperceptible way.

01:21:02.189 --> 01:21:04.990
They actually feel happy,

01:21:04.992 --> 01:21:07.358
but it cannot be compared
to the sort of happiness

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:08.930
that we wanted to create.

01:21:09.596 --> 01:21:12.063
The consequences
that we are facing here,

01:21:12.065 --> 01:21:13.400
they could be disastrous.

01:21:14.969 --> 01:21:16.070
Could they?

01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:18.606
Well,
wouldn't it be terrible if...

01:21:19.073 --> 01:21:20.539
people lost
their genuine feelings

01:21:20.541 --> 01:21:22.574
and only pretended
to be the same as before,

01:21:22.576 --> 01:21:24.175
but they weren't,
because actually

01:21:24.177 --> 01:21:25.443
they had stopped caring

01:21:25.445 --> 01:21:27.349
about anybody else
but the plant?

01:21:28.315 --> 01:21:29.885
As long as they're happy.

01:21:33.154 --> 01:21:35.521
- I was joking.
- We can't take any risks here.

01:21:35.523 --> 01:21:37.458
We must have the whole
genome sequenced.

01:21:39.193 --> 01:21:40.261
Very well then.

01:21:41.028 --> 01:21:43.227
I'll get everything ready
and we can send a sample

01:21:43.229 --> 01:21:44.531
to Genex later today.

01:24:02.802 --> 01:24:05.536
My Bello was
the only living being

01:24:05.538 --> 01:24:07.141
I ever really loved.

01:24:08.341 --> 01:24:10.077
I didn't inhale the pollen.

01:24:11.112 --> 01:24:12.279
I just pretended.

01:24:13.713 --> 01:24:16.117
Like I always just pretended.

01:24:19.185 --> 01:24:21.753
Bello was the only one
I could be myself with.

01:24:21.755 --> 01:24:23.158
And now he's gone.

01:24:25.759 --> 01:24:27.228
You're all gone.

01:24:28.162 --> 01:24:29.463
You just don't know it.

01:24:33.134 --> 01:24:35.569
You're no longer
your real selves.

01:24:40.274 --> 01:24:42.744
I'm afraid I'm still
pretty much myself.

01:24:43.877 --> 01:24:48.148
- What about you?
- Yeah, I am, too.

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:01.229
Come and sit down.

01:25:02.195 --> 01:25:03.765
What's the matter
with you, Bella?

01:25:04.164 --> 01:25:06.397
Nothing's the matter.
Nothing at all.

01:25:06.399 --> 01:25:08.400
- Please, sit down.
- I don't want to sit down.

01:25:08.402 --> 01:25:09.537
Just leave me alone.

01:25:10.904 --> 01:25:12.474
Oh, my God...

01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:15.510
Nice and easy now, Bella.

01:25:17.243 --> 01:25:18.612
Where's your medication?

01:25:19.212 --> 01:25:21.312
- Go and see a doctor.
- I don't need a doctor.

01:25:21.314 --> 01:25:22.349
Let go.

01:25:31.824 --> 01:25:33.558
No, we'll deal with this.

01:25:39.399 --> 01:25:40.501
Sorry.

01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:42.403
I'm just...

01:26:06.292 --> 01:26:07.793
- Don't come any closer.
- Please.

01:26:07.795 --> 01:26:09.794
- Stay where you are.
- Bella.

01:26:46.367 --> 01:26:48.000
- What have you done?
- Nothing.

01:26:48.002 --> 01:26:49.504
We were trying to stop her.

01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:51.439
It's not what you think.

01:27:06.319 --> 01:27:10.257
What can I say is that
I'm absolutely shaken.

01:27:11.324 --> 01:27:14.595
Bella was...
is my closest colleague.

01:27:14.795 --> 01:27:18.899
Her dedication and empathy...

01:27:20.333 --> 01:27:22.804
absolutely invaluable
to the work we do here.

01:27:24.872 --> 01:27:28.373
So, all our thoughts
are with our dear colleague

01:27:28.375 --> 01:27:29.577
who is, at this moment,

01:27:30.476 --> 01:27:31.778
fighting for her life.

01:27:34.381 --> 01:27:36.815
And as soon as we know more,
we'll post that information

01:27:36.817 --> 01:27:38.453
on the internal newsletter.

01:27:41.854 --> 01:27:44.623
But now, in spite
of today's tragic events,

01:27:44.625 --> 01:27:46.293
we must carry on.

01:27:46.627 --> 01:27:47.862
The fair is approaching.

01:27:48.628 --> 01:27:52.300
So... congratulations
Team Woodard and Ric.

01:27:52.632 --> 01:27:55.067
You have done
fantastic work.

01:27:55.069 --> 01:27:57.635
The test results confirm
that Little Joe doesn't trigger

01:27:57.637 --> 01:28:00.571
any serious allergies
or other adverse reactions.

01:28:00.573 --> 01:28:04.375
So, consequently,
face masks need longer be worn,

01:28:04.377 --> 01:28:05.846
with immediate effect.

01:28:08.515 --> 01:28:10.618
We will be ready
for the flower fair.

01:28:12.653 --> 01:28:16.053
There'll always be somebody
with minor allergic reactions.

01:28:18.725 --> 01:28:19.693
Well...

01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:21.727
I'm so sorry, Alice.

01:28:21.729 --> 01:28:23.628
Little Joe is harmless.

01:28:23.630 --> 01:28:27.398
Now I take full responsibility
for the failure of my Flash 2s.

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:29.002
So I'll just have to do better
next time.

01:28:29.837 --> 01:28:33.041
Yeah? Concerning the sample
you prepared...

01:28:34.041 --> 01:28:35.076
Yes?

01:28:35.708 --> 01:28:37.878
We won't need it. I mean...

01:28:38.612 --> 01:28:40.478
Neither of us wants Genex
finding out

01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:42.817
about your somewhat
unorthodox approach.

01:28:43.783 --> 01:28:45.683
Now that we're so close
to presenting

01:28:45.685 --> 01:28:47.587
our Little Joes to the public,

01:28:48.087 --> 01:28:51.058
we don't want to spoil it,
do we?

01:28:52.893 --> 01:28:54.828
But the risk of infection...

01:28:55.895 --> 01:28:57.562
Please, don't be offended,

01:28:57.564 --> 01:28:59.600
but your theory lacks
any sort of evidence.

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.867
There are simply no symptoms.

01:29:02.869 --> 01:29:07.474
And who can prove
the genuineness of feelings?

01:29:07.875 --> 01:29:09.674
Moreover, who cares?

01:29:11.811 --> 01:29:14.178
I fear Bella's ideas
have infected your mind,

01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:15.649
rather than any virus.

01:29:15.948 --> 01:29:19.586
It seems that this has all been
a bit much for you.

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:22.522
If there's anything I can do?

01:29:23.524 --> 01:29:26.361
No, I'm... I should be fine.

01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:22.149
Still here so late?

01:30:25.752 --> 01:30:27.555
Just checking
the thermostat.

01:30:27.921 --> 01:30:30.525
- Well?
- Well what?

01:30:31.091 --> 01:30:32.493
Is the temperature all right?

01:30:32.859 --> 01:30:34.161
Yeah, everything's fine.

01:30:35.962 --> 01:30:38.830
It's just I thought

01:30:38.832 --> 01:30:40.701
that you might
do something rash.

01:30:41.902 --> 01:30:43.538
What makes you think that?

01:30:45.538 --> 01:30:48.208
You have been getting
a bit carried away recently.

01:30:53.113 --> 01:30:55.182
A bit chilly in here, isn't it?

01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:57.485
Um...

01:30:57.984 --> 01:30:59.119
Alice...

01:31:00.654 --> 01:31:02.223
you don't really want this.

01:31:04.291 --> 01:31:05.893
Please, just trust me for once.

01:31:06.193 --> 01:31:08.496
I'll convince Karl
to authorize the sequencing.

01:31:12.666 --> 01:31:14.101
We are a team after all.

01:31:20.274 --> 01:31:21.609
How could you?

01:31:23.143 --> 01:31:24.612
Your own children!

01:31:27.014 --> 01:31:27.981
I know.

01:31:28.814 --> 01:31:30.248
But I can't take the risk.

01:31:30.250 --> 01:31:32.683
If I made a mistake,
then it's my fault.

01:31:32.685 --> 01:31:35.555
No, it's not.
I am a part of this as well.

01:31:35.922 --> 01:31:38.723
Chris,
I am the one who did...

01:31:38.725 --> 01:31:41.195
Oh, me, me, me!
This isn't all about you.

01:31:42.261 --> 01:31:43.997
- Give me the...
- No!

01:31:44.730 --> 01:31:45.932
Give me the key!

01:31:48.734 --> 01:31:49.737
Just...

01:34:10.877 --> 01:34:12.680
Uh, I have some news

01:34:12.912 --> 01:34:15.115
that I wouldn't want to keep
from you.

01:34:16.349 --> 01:34:19.686
Little Joe has been nominated

01:34:20.453 --> 01:34:22.922
for the European Herb
& Health Award.

01:34:25.292 --> 01:34:29.396
Um, as you know already,
we've received orders from...

01:34:29.829 --> 01:34:32.867
the National School Board
and NHS providers.

01:34:33.132 --> 01:34:36.366
So, soon Little Joe
will be improving well-being

01:34:36.368 --> 01:34:40.104
in classrooms
and hospital wards nationwide.

01:34:40.106 --> 01:34:43.842
Plus, with this nomination,

01:34:43.844 --> 01:34:47.148
we will receive orders
from all over the world.

01:34:48.148 --> 01:34:49.848
Even the EU.

01:34:52.418 --> 01:34:56.122
Little Joe is our finest work
by far.

01:35:00.127 --> 01:35:03.093
It was a good decision
to bring you in after all.

01:35:03.095 --> 01:35:04.264
Oh...

01:35:05.332 --> 01:35:06.164
You've turned out
to be one of our top breeders.

01:35:06.166 --> 01:35:09.933
So... congratulations
to you both.

01:35:09.935 --> 01:35:11.037
Um...

01:35:12.372 --> 01:35:16.143
Little Joe will make the world
a little happier.

01:35:16.443 --> 01:35:17.712
To us.

01:35:18.110 --> 01:35:19.279
To team Woodard.

01:35:19.813 --> 01:35:21.845
- To you.
- To Little Joe.

01:35:21.847 --> 01:35:23.250
- Little Joe.
- Little Joe.

01:35:28.555 --> 01:35:29.856
Alice...

01:35:30.222 --> 01:35:32.059
again, about what happened,

01:35:32.359 --> 01:35:33.461
I'm so sorry.

01:35:35.194 --> 01:35:38.364
I was so angry
because you always...

01:35:40.966 --> 01:35:42.168
and you never really...

01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:45.271
Anyway.

01:35:46.405 --> 01:35:49.007
Maybe it's too late now
and I've screwed everything up,

01:35:49.009 --> 01:35:53.146
but I do want you to know
how much I respect you.

01:35:55.881 --> 01:35:57.016
Please forgive me.

01:35:58.184 --> 01:36:00.454
It looks as though it was me
who screwed everything up.

01:36:01.954 --> 01:36:03.224
We are a team after all.

01:36:30.283 --> 01:36:31.415
Mm.

01:36:31.417 --> 01:36:32.920
Vietnamese.

01:36:34.154 --> 01:36:35.422
That makes a change.

01:36:39.458 --> 01:36:42.061
I'm glad to see
I can still surprise you.

01:36:47.567 --> 01:36:49.467
Joe, I've been thinking,

01:36:49.469 --> 01:36:51.971
if you still want to move in
with your father,

01:36:52.204 --> 01:36:53.541
I would understand.

01:36:55.207 --> 01:36:56.210
Really?

01:36:59.145 --> 01:37:01.245
Maybe I was just too worried.

01:37:01.247 --> 01:37:03.016
You know me,
always fearing the worst.

01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:06.250
Yeah, true.

01:37:06.252 --> 01:37:09.222
And I suppose it's high time
I learn to manage without you.

01:37:19.131 --> 01:37:20.598
Oh, gosh,
what did you put in here?

01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:22.469
- It's so heavy.
- Just rocks.

01:37:23.203 --> 01:37:24.438
Pull.

01:37:35.215 --> 01:37:36.583
Take good care of yourself.

01:37:38.618 --> 01:37:39.587
Yeah.

01:37:41.354 --> 01:37:43.220
You're doing the right thing,
believe me.

01:37:43.222 --> 01:37:44.158
Mm-hmm.

01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:46.124
You're a good mother,

01:37:46.126 --> 01:37:47.528
but an even better
plant-breeder.

01:37:48.094 --> 01:37:49.363
If you say so.

01:37:50.462 --> 01:37:52.131
Anyway, I have to go now.

01:37:54.567 --> 01:37:56.069
I have work to do.

01:38:21.261 --> 01:38:23.527
For a minute there,
I really believed that my plant

01:38:23.529 --> 01:38:24.931
would change people.

01:38:26.065 --> 01:38:29.500
How absurd to think that a plant
would change the love

01:38:29.502 --> 01:38:32.072
- between a mother and a child.
- Right.

01:38:32.671 --> 01:38:34.440
And what made you change
your mind?

01:38:35.007 --> 01:38:37.642
Oh, there was no proof,
no virus could be found.

01:38:37.644 --> 01:38:38.913
I see.

01:38:39.645 --> 01:38:41.314
And can you be sure?

01:38:41.613 --> 01:38:42.615
Yes.

01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:45.717
We finally had
the sequencing done.

01:38:45.719 --> 01:38:47.253
And it's all fine.

01:38:48.287 --> 01:38:50.420
And do you have any idea
why you believed it

01:38:50.422 --> 01:38:51.958
in the first place?

01:38:52.559 --> 01:38:55.026
I guess I felt guilty
about spending more time

01:38:55.028 --> 01:38:56.995
with Little Joe
than with Joe.

01:38:56.997 --> 01:38:58.231
But what can I do,

01:38:58.564 --> 01:39:00.099
I love my work too.

01:39:00.667 --> 01:39:02.436
And a boy needs his father.

01:39:03.569 --> 01:39:06.070
And you know what, maybe
I did actually wish for it,

01:39:06.072 --> 01:39:07.373
unconsciously.

01:39:08.574 --> 01:39:09.674
That Joe
would move in with his father?

01:39:09.676 --> 01:39:10.678
Yeah.

01:39:11.411 --> 01:39:13.447
To have a bit more time
for myself

01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:15.182
and my work.

01:39:16.115 --> 01:39:16.781
And there's really no need

01:39:16.783 --> 01:39:17.817
to blame yourself for that.

01:39:19.351 --> 01:39:22.989
It would be a mistake
to deny who you really are.

01:39:31.463 --> 01:39:32.796
Is it the one
that makes you happy?

01:39:32.798 --> 01:39:33.734
Hmm.

01:39:34.701 --> 01:39:36.634
Hmm, lovely.

01:39:36.636 --> 01:39:38.305
They like being talked to.

01:40:18.278 --> 01:40:20.146
Good night, Little Joe.

01:40:28.154 --> 01:40:30.153
Good night, Mum.

01:40:39.351 --> 01:40:44.351
