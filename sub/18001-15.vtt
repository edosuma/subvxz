00:03.743 --> 00:06.320
Ming: Hey, if you could be any
superhero, who would you be?

00:06.355 --> 00:08.994
Walt: Why do you always assume
that if you get superpowers,

00:09.028 --> 00:10.501
you automatically become a superhero?

00:10.535 --> 00:13.609
I never hear you ask, "What kind
of super-villain would you be?

00:13.643 --> 00:15.946
A super-villain motivated
to steal for money,

00:15.980 --> 00:17.451
or would you be more like

00:17.485 --> 00:19.053
the world-dominating
kind of super-villain?"

00:19.087 --> 00:20.288
Ming: I definitely want to rule the world.

00:20.322 --> 00:21.590
Like, if you rule the world,

00:21.624 --> 00:23.393
then you can get all these other things.

00:23.427 --> 00:25.398
Walt: You don't have the
mind-set to rule the world.

00:25.432 --> 00:26.801
You don't want to get your hands dirty,

00:26.836 --> 00:28.469
and you don't want to be disliked.

00:28.504 --> 00:29.972
Bryan: That is such a good point.

00:30.006 --> 00:31.775
Like, "Ooh, somebody doesn't like me?"

00:31.809 --> 00:33.379
And, like, would you have it
in you to have them killed?

00:33.414 --> 00:35.285
- Ming: Sure.
- Walt: Bullcrap!

00:35.319 --> 00:37.155
Ming: If they didn't like
me, yeah, gone, they're dead.

00:37.190 --> 00:39.391
Walt: I definitely think
I'd go for ruling the world.

00:39.425 --> 00:40.725
I think I could do a good job.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.295
A lot of people would have to go.

00:42.329 --> 00:44.366
Bryan: Like, certain races, or...?

00:44.401 --> 00:48.172
[laughter]

00:48.207 --> 00:50.175
Walt: I was talking about
these two clowns.

00:50.211 --> 00:51.547
Bryan: Oh, okay.

00:51.581 --> 00:53.984
[heroic music]

00:54.018 --> 00:56.255

01:26.026 --> 01:28.331
Hello. Welcome to another
episode of Comic Book Men,

01:28.365 --> 01:31.771
the only show that can hold the
wall against the white walkers.

01:31.805 --> 01:33.305
I'm your host, Kevin Smith.

01:33.339 --> 01:34.940
- Bryan: Bryan Johnson.
- Walt: Walt Flanagan.

01:34.974 --> 01:36.443
- Mike: Mike Zapcic.
- Ming: Ming Chen.

01:36.477 --> 01:38.079
Kevin: Okay, man,

01:38.113 --> 01:39.616
did anybody bring in a
monkey's paw this week?

01:39.650 --> 01:41.017
Ming: The other day a
guy brought in something

01:41.052 --> 01:43.454
that I remember from my childhood.

01:47.558 --> 01:49.493
Walt: Oh, what's up, guys?

01:49.527 --> 01:50.962
Man: How you doing?

01:50.996 --> 01:52.666
Ming: What is this?

01:52.701 --> 01:54.202
<i>Man: It's a original Donkey Kong machine.</i>

01:54.237 --> 01:55.572
Walt: Really?

02:01.385 --> 02:03.385
Man: It's very '80s.

02:03.420 --> 02:05.721
- Mike: Does it work?
- Man: Yeah, let me turn it on.

02:05.755 --> 02:07.857
It takes a little while to warm up.

02:07.892 --> 02:10.293
- Ming: Oh, yeah.
- Mike: Oh, wow.

02:10.327 --> 02:11.594
- Ming: That's awesome.
- Man: There he is.

02:11.629 --> 02:13.163
Man: There it is, huh?

02:13.197 --> 02:14.966
<i>Walt: Now, as I recall,
the original Donkey Kong,</i>

02:15.000 --> 02:16.367
I don't remember it looking like this.

02:16.402 --> 02:17.969
Ming: Yeah, there was a stand-up one,

02:18.004 --> 02:19.304
but, you know, they took
some of the video games

02:19.339 --> 02:20.973
and made them, like, cocktail tables.

02:21.007 --> 02:22.476
Man: Yeah, the reason why
they did this because bars

02:22.510 --> 02:23.810
got mad when they had the big arcade games.

02:23.845 --> 02:25.078
There's no place to put a drink,

02:25.113 --> 02:27.148
so they made these cocktail tables

02:27.182 --> 02:30.187
so you could drink and
play, feed the quarters.

02:30.222 --> 02:31.887
Bryan: That sounds problematic

02:31.921 --> 02:33.854
<i>if you'd get angry while
playing Donkey Kong.</i>

02:33.889 --> 02:35.692
[laughter]

02:35.727 --> 02:38.195
Kevin: I remember being chased
out of a few bars in Highlands

02:38.229 --> 02:39.863
when I was a kid, 'cause
every once in a while,

02:39.898 --> 02:42.167
the bars would have games
that you couldn't find

02:42.202 --> 02:43.869
- in other stores in town.
- Ming: Yep.

02:43.903 --> 02:46.171
Bryan: Did you have that
experience with video games?

02:46.205 --> 02:47.839
Walt: I mean, I got to admit,

02:47.873 --> 02:51.174
video games always befuddled
me, even to this day.

02:51.208 --> 02:52.943
Ming: Wait, the early ones befuddled you?

02:52.977 --> 02:54.342
Bryan: "One or two players?

02:54.376 --> 02:55.742
How am I supposed to figure this out?"

02:55.777 --> 02:58.412
Kevin: "How does this work?"

02:58.447 --> 03:01.082
[laughter]

03:01.116 --> 03:02.584
<i>Walt: Were you... were
you into Donkey Kong?</i>

03:02.618 --> 03:04.353
Ming: Yeah, I remember being fascinated.

03:04.387 --> 03:06.055
I think, um, I was about six or seven

03:06.089 --> 03:07.790
when video games really hit,

03:07.825 --> 03:10.093
and I remember when I was a
little kid, I went to the mall.

03:10.127 --> 03:11.595
I dragged my parents in the arcade,

03:11.629 --> 03:14.200
<i>and I begged them to
let me play Donkey Kong.</i>

03:14.235 --> 03:15.805
And my dad was like, "No.

03:15.839 --> 03:17.206
"No, we're leaving. Let's get out of here.

03:17.241 --> 03:19.042
I'm not gonna let you play this."

03:19.076 --> 03:20.646
Finally, I made such
a fuss, then he's like,

03:20.680 --> 03:22.148
"Fine. Here, here's a quarter,"

03:22.182 --> 03:23.981
<i>and the game I chose
to play was Donkey Kong.</i>

03:24.016 --> 03:25.550
I played the first level.

03:25.584 --> 03:27.153
I died really quick, and he goes,

03:27.187 --> 03:29.790
"See? What'd you get out of that? Nothing.

03:29.824 --> 03:30.990
You didn't get anything."

03:31.024 --> 03:32.791
And he dragged me out of there.

03:32.826 --> 03:34.962
It was a lesson in not wasting money.

03:34.996 --> 03:37.565
Walt: I'm so sorry we're
so mean to you at times.

03:37.599 --> 03:41.139
I forget that, like, you had
the childhood that, like...

03:41.173 --> 03:42.739
Bryan: Like, Oliver Twist
would have been like,

03:42.773 --> 03:44.140
"Wow. His life sucks."

03:44.174 --> 03:46.978
[laughter]

03:47.012 --> 03:48.815
Ming: Yeah. But that's cool.
Where did you get this thing?

03:48.850 --> 03:50.117
Like, I've seen the stand-up.

03:50.152 --> 03:51.685
I've never seen a cocktail table.

03:51.720 --> 03:53.689
Man: We moved into an apartment
together after college,

03:53.723 --> 03:56.259
and we had a dining room, and
we're a couple single guys,

03:56.293 --> 03:57.459
- like...
- Man: Who needs that?

03:57.493 --> 03:58.994
Man: Yeah, who needs a dining room?

03:59.029 --> 04:01.030
And so we found it off a guy on Craigslist

04:01.064 --> 04:03.527
who, you know, buys these
machines and restores them.

04:03.562 --> 04:05.461
Ming: Was this your dining-room table?

04:05.495 --> 04:07.328
Man: Yeah. When I met my fiancé,

04:07.363 --> 04:08.796
we would have her over for
dinner, we'd just throw, like,

04:08.830 --> 04:10.695
a bedsheet over it and just, you know...

04:10.729 --> 04:12.696
- Walt: Whoa.
- Bryan: You bang on it?

04:12.730 --> 04:14.832
- [laughter]
- Man: No, we...

04:14.866 --> 04:16.665
Ming: So why are you
looking to sell this today?

04:16.700 --> 04:18.333
Man: I'm moving in with my fiancé,

04:18.367 --> 04:19.868
so we're kind of selling
off all the cool [bleep]

04:19.902 --> 04:22.304
- Of our bachelor pad.
Walt: I'm sorry, fellas.

04:22.338 --> 04:24.271
- The Stash is not interested.
Man: I understand.

04:24.305 --> 04:25.638
Walt: You want a hand
bringing it out to the car?

04:25.672 --> 04:27.107
Man: Yeah, if you guys don't mind.

04:27.141 --> 04:28.843
- Walt: No problem.
- Ming: Wait, wait.

04:28.878 --> 04:30.277
Hold on. Hold on. I actually
might want this for myself.

04:30.311 --> 04:31.711
Walt: What?

04:31.746 --> 04:33.346
Ming: How much? How much
do you want for this?

04:33.380 --> 04:35.448
Man: I guess we were originally
looking for, like, $700.

04:35.482 --> 04:39.720
Ming: [inhales sharply]
Would you take $400?

04:39.755 --> 04:41.357
Man: Well, we paid $500 for it.

04:41.392 --> 04:43.024
We'd like to at least get our money back.

04:43.059 --> 04:44.491
If you want to do $500, we could do that.

04:44.526 --> 04:47.028
- Ming: $500?
- Walt: Wow.

04:47.062 --> 04:48.530
I can't even believe you're
contemplating paying $500

04:48.564 --> 04:49.999
for this piece of junk.

04:50.033 --> 04:51.400
- Sorry, fellas.
- Bryan: These guys are like...

04:51.434 --> 04:52.568
- Walt: Sorry, guys.
- Man: Hey, no offense.

04:52.603 --> 04:53.703
Ming: I'll do $500.

04:53.738 --> 04:55.138
- Man: $500?
- Walt: Wow.

04:55.173 --> 04:56.508
- Ming: $500.
- Man: All right, thank you, Ming.

04:56.542 --> 04:58.711
- Ming: You got it.
- Walt: Wow.

04:58.745 --> 05:00.983
Man: Walt, I have something I
think you'll be interested in.

05:01.017 --> 05:04.024
Walt: Bearing gifts, huh?

05:04.058 --> 05:06.027
Get the [bleep] out of here.

05:11.637 --> 05:14.103
- Walt: How you doing?
- Woman: Hi. How are you guys?

05:14.138 --> 05:15.574
Walt: Good. What can we do for you guys?

05:15.608 --> 05:18.709
Woman: We were looking
for a She-Ra statue.

05:18.744 --> 05:20.945
Walt: She-Ra.
That's the He-Man?

05:20.979 --> 05:22.547
Woman: Yes, it's his twin sister.

05:22.582 --> 05:23.915
Walt: Oh, okay. I thought that...

05:23.950 --> 05:25.551
Ming: Yeah, you didn't know that?

05:25.585 --> 05:26.952
Walt: No, I assumed that
they were love interests.

05:26.986 --> 05:28.620
Bryan: I assume both.

05:28.655 --> 05:30.655
Walt: Um, I don't think we
have a She-Ra statue, though.

05:30.689 --> 05:32.623
Woman: Well, I'm into
anything She-Ra, really.

05:32.657 --> 05:34.159
- Woman: Yeah.
- Walt: She-Ra.

05:34.193 --> 05:37.561
Hey, man, didn't we get
that score from Rob Bruce?

05:37.595 --> 05:40.732
Didn't it have some of
the She-Ra Colorforms?

05:40.767 --> 05:42.368
Ming: Yeah. I think I saw
one in there. Let me go check.

05:42.402 --> 05:44.068
- Walt: All right, thanks.
- Woman: Colorforms would be cool.

05:44.103 --> 05:45.435
Walt: Colorforms? Do
you remember Colorforms?

05:45.470 --> 05:47.204
Woman: I love Colorforms.

05:52.913 --> 05:54.780
- Woman: Ooh.
- Woman: Ooh.

05:54.815 --> 05:56.681
- Walt: Check this out.
- Woman: That's beautiful.

05:56.709 --> 05:58.911
Walt: It is beautiful 'cause
it's never been opened,

05:58.945 --> 06:00.682
never been touched by human hands.

06:00.716 --> 06:03.616
Woman: So you know I'm
gonna change that, right?

06:03.651 --> 06:05.117
Walt: Oh, if you buy
this, you would open it?

06:05.152 --> 06:07.252
Woman: Absolutely. I want to play with it.

06:07.286 --> 06:10.487
Walt: A Colorform set unopened,
never been played with...

06:10.521 --> 06:12.789
- Woman: That's gonna change.
- Walt: That would...

06:12.824 --> 06:14.291
[women laugh]

06:14.325 --> 06:15.794
Bryan: It would almost
be irresponsible of you

06:15.828 --> 06:18.429
to sell that to them, knowing...

06:18.463 --> 06:19.997
Kevin: I love Colorforms.

06:20.032 --> 06:22.870
They're the greatest
non-toy toy that ever was,

06:22.904 --> 06:23.904
'cause what is it?

06:23.938 --> 06:25.838
It's a two-dimensional diorama.

06:25.872 --> 06:27.741
There wasn't a lot of
set-up or play involved.

06:27.776 --> 06:30.411
You just peel them off
and put them on the image,

06:30.445 --> 06:31.878
the background that there was.

06:31.913 --> 06:35.484
Walt: The imagination needed to have fun

06:35.519 --> 06:38.321
with little vinyl paper dolls,

06:38.355 --> 06:40.187
and you did need to have an imagination.

06:40.222 --> 06:41.622
Kevin: 'Cause you
were done in 30 seconds,

06:41.657 --> 06:43.626
and then you were like, "Now what?

06:43.660 --> 06:46.796
Is this... is the fun
about to happen?"

06:46.830 --> 06:50.833
Walt: All right, now let's talk
about some serious brass tacks.

06:50.868 --> 06:52.602
So it's $75.

06:52.637 --> 06:55.471
Woman: Could you take $40 for it?

06:55.505 --> 06:57.240
Walt: $40?

06:57.274 --> 06:59.308
Oh, I couldn't go that
low. I mean, look at it.

06:59.342 --> 07:02.410
I mean, it looks like it was
just made this morning for you.

07:02.444 --> 07:03.979
Woman: I know, but it's
going to a good home,

07:04.013 --> 07:05.815
and I'm gonna enjoy it.

07:05.849 --> 07:07.418
Walt: It's not a puppy. We
don't care where it's going.

07:07.453 --> 07:09.255
We don't care how bad
the home life is there

07:09.289 --> 07:12.496
that this goes to. [laughter]

07:12.530 --> 07:16.065
Woman: What's the best
do you think you could do?

07:16.100 --> 07:17.899
Walt: How about $55?

07:17.934 --> 07:19.967
But that's absolutely
the lowest I can do on it.

07:20.001 --> 07:22.500
Woman: Okay. I'll do $55.

07:22.534 --> 07:24.234
- Walt: Deal, $55?
- Woman: Yes. Deal, yes.

07:24.268 --> 07:26.802
Walt: All right, $55 please.

07:26.836 --> 07:28.503
You are getting the deal of the day, huh?

07:28.537 --> 07:30.003
Ming: The Walt Flanagan special today.

07:30.038 --> 07:31.770
Woman: Thank you.
Ming: No more deals today.

07:31.804 --> 07:34.507
Walt: You're positive
you're gonna open it, huh?

07:34.541 --> 07:37.274
Woman: I am super
positive I'm gonna open it.

07:37.308 --> 07:40.111
Are you interested to see what's in there?

07:40.145 --> 07:41.544
Walt: Uh...

07:41.578 --> 07:42.878
Woman: I remember they had a fragrance.

07:42.912 --> 07:44.011
Woman: Yeah, good smell to them.

07:44.045 --> 07:45.213
Walt: Colorform? You are right.

07:45.247 --> 07:46.348
It was the smell of childhood.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.017
- Woman: Mm-hmm.
- Woman: Exactly.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.417
Walt: You know what? If
you're gonna open it up,

07:49.451 --> 07:51.584
I wouldn't mind getting a whiff of it.

07:51.618 --> 07:53.051
- Woman: There you go.
- Woman: Let's take a whiff.

07:53.086 --> 07:54.353
Walt: You should do the
honors. You bought it.

07:54.389 --> 07:55.990
Woman: All right. I'm excited.

07:56.024 --> 07:57.592
- Here we go.
- Ming: Too late now.

07:57.626 --> 08:00.160
- Bryan: Not any more.
- Walt: It just depreciated 50%.

08:00.195 --> 08:03.264
Bryan: Walt will now buy
it back from you for $10.

08:03.298 --> 08:05.264
- Woman: Oh, boy.
- Woman: Ready?

08:05.298 --> 08:07.697
- Walt: I'm ready.
- Woman: Ooh.

08:07.732 --> 08:09.433
Woman: Wow.

08:09.468 --> 08:11.435
- Woman: Look at all those colors.
- Woman: That is nice.

08:11.469 --> 08:14.634
Woman: Yes, who would like to take a whiff?

08:14.669 --> 08:16.302
Walt: Oh, it's kind of lost
its smell over the years.

08:16.336 --> 08:17.638
Bryan: Really? It didn't retain its scent?

08:17.673 --> 08:19.408
Woman: Yeah. I got it.

08:19.442 --> 08:22.244
I smell $50 worth of Colorforms
that I'm in love with.

08:22.279 --> 08:23.947
Walt: Happy?

08:23.982 --> 08:25.550
- Woman: Very happy. Excited.
- Woman: It's nice.

08:25.584 --> 08:26.984
Walt: Well, great.
I'm glad that you...

08:27.018 --> 08:28.551
- Woman: Thank you, guys.
- Walt: Glad you dig it.

08:28.585 --> 08:29.985
- Woman: Thank you.
- Woman: Thank you very much.

08:30.020 --> 08:31.854
- Ming: See you later.
- Woman: Bye-bye.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.662
Man: Gentlemen, how's everybody today?

08:38.696 --> 08:40.063
- Walt: What's up, Roberto?
- Ming: What's going on?

08:40.097 --> 08:41.767
Rob: I'm doing all right.

08:41.801 --> 08:43.768
Walt, I have something I
think you'll be interested in.

08:43.802 --> 08:45.302
Walt: Oh, yeah? What's that?

08:45.337 --> 08:47.504
Rob: You got to open it up, man.

08:47.538 --> 08:49.705
Walt: Bearing gifts, huh?

08:52.377 --> 08:53.743
What is this?

08:53.778 --> 08:55.909
Rob: Those are four all-access passes

08:55.943 --> 09:00.148
to this weekend's KISS
concert at PNC Arts Center.

09:00.183 --> 09:02.351
Walt: Get the [bleep] out of here.

09:02.385 --> 09:03.886
Kevin: Oh, my lord.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.587
If you want to win the heart,

09:05.622 --> 09:09.253
soul, organs of Walter Flanagan,

09:09.288 --> 09:10.854
all you got to do

09:10.888 --> 09:13.158
is throw out four magic
letters for him... KISS, man.

09:13.193 --> 09:16.024
He's been a soldier in the
KISS Army since childhood.

09:16.059 --> 09:18.025
Walt: It was hard. It was heavy.

09:18.060 --> 09:20.363
It was... it was
everything that, you know,

09:20.397 --> 09:23.563
that a boy should be listening
to who's ready to become a man.

09:23.597 --> 09:26.428
[laughter]

09:26.463 --> 09:27.929
No way.

09:27.964 --> 09:29.597
- Where did you get this?
- Rob: I got a friend.

09:29.632 --> 09:32.601
He works for Doc McGhee,
who's KISS'S manager.

09:32.635 --> 09:33.935
Walt: I'm serious, man.

09:33.970 --> 09:35.737
It's been a lifelong dream of mine

09:35.771 --> 09:37.638
to get backstage at a KISS concert.

09:37.673 --> 09:39.273
Rob: Here's your opportunity.

09:39.307 --> 09:40.974
Walt: I always thought it
would come at some, you know,

09:41.008 --> 09:43.643
humiliating cost, you know,
me and some roadie, but...

09:43.677 --> 09:46.745
[laughter]

09:46.779 --> 09:48.280
Rob: And there's something else.

09:48.315 --> 09:49.984
When you get there,
you go to the back door,

09:50.018 --> 09:51.849
- find my buddy Matt.
- Walt: Matt.

09:51.883 --> 09:53.817
Rob: My buddy Matt works for the manager.

09:53.851 --> 09:56.621
There's a chance that he can
get you into the green room.

09:56.655 --> 09:57.988
Walt: The green room.

09:58.023 --> 09:59.756
Rob: And that's where, obviously,

09:59.791 --> 10:01.793
Gene and the guys hang out.

10:01.827 --> 10:04.666
Walt: Oh, my God. I've got the
perfect item I'm gonna bring...

10:04.700 --> 10:08.539
my 1977 Marvel Comic
Super Special Number 1,

10:08.573 --> 10:11.277
the very first KISS comic, printed with...

10:11.311 --> 10:14.312
Ming: KISS'S blood.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.813
Walt: I'm gonna get that sucker signed.

10:15.848 --> 10:17.316
Thank you, bro. I'm serious.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.185
I mean, it's KISS-tory.

10:19.220 --> 10:21.052
Rob: I couldn't think of a better person,

10:21.086 --> 10:22.822
a better group of guys, to go see KISS.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.026
- Walt: We'll make you proud, bro.
- Rob: Okay, brother.

10:25.061 --> 10:27.693
Walt: Thanks.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.129
Man: I have the original cover

10:29.163 --> 10:31.500
<i>to Wolverine number 8 by John Buscema.</i>

10:31.534 --> 10:33.002
Walt: Oh, my God.

10:33.037 --> 10:34.536
Man: Gene's back in the
green room right now.

10:34.570 --> 10:37.571
We'll go see if we can
pop in and say, "Hey."

10:38.531 --> 10:41.970
Walt: I was nine years old
when KISS came on my radar.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.333
I fell in love with them
the very first moment

10:44.368 --> 10:45.633
I picked up the copy

10:45.668 --> 10:48.504
of Marvel Comics Super Special number 1,

10:48.538 --> 10:50.704
the first comic book appearance of KISS.

10:50.738 --> 10:52.671
Kevin: So that was... You'd
never heard the music?

10:52.706 --> 10:55.146
The first... Your introduction
to a rock-and-roll band

10:55.180 --> 10:56.748
- was a comic book?
- Walt: Absolutely.

10:56.782 --> 10:59.383
The makeup was everything for me as a kid.

10:59.417 --> 11:02.355
I had to know what this was all about.

11:02.389 --> 11:05.523
I had to know, "What did
this band sound like?"

11:05.557 --> 11:07.323
So I got my first record.

11:07.358 --> 11:09.528
<i>I traded some Mad magazines</i>

11:09.562 --> 11:13.730
with a neighborhood kid
for four KISS albums.

11:13.764 --> 11:15.732
- Kevin: That's a sweet deal, man.
- Walt: Oh, yeah.

11:15.766 --> 11:18.570
Bryan: Even back then he
was ripping people off.

11:18.604 --> 11:21.504
Kevin: He was just training
to run a comic book store.

11:30.204 --> 11:31.279
Walt: Hey, man, how you doing?

11:31.279 --> 11:32.275
Man: Good. How are you guys doing?

11:32.298 --> 11:33.203
Mike: Good. What's up?

11:33.203 --> 11:34.933
Man: Uh, I actually
wanted to show you today

11:34.933 --> 11:35.880
something you might be interested in.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.735
<i>I have the original cover
to Wolverine number 8</i>

11:38.735 --> 11:39.947
by John Buscema.

11:39.947 --> 11:40.886
Walt: Oh, my God.

11:40.886 --> 11:43.519
I'm a gigantic John Buscema fan.

11:50.650 --> 11:51.653
Where did you get this?

11:51.745 --> 11:53.613
Man: When I was younger,
it's like, I had some comics

11:53.647 --> 11:54.614
that I wanted to get signed.

11:54.648 --> 11:56.382
I sent them off to John Buscema,

11:56.417 --> 11:58.184
and I didn't get anything returned at all

11:58.218 --> 12:01.287
for, like, nine months, and I
just totally said it was a wash,

12:01.321 --> 12:03.524
and then all of a sudden, I
got this package in the mail,

12:03.558 --> 12:05.426
and I saw this.

12:05.460 --> 12:07.861
I got this. He sent me this
because he lost my comics,

12:07.895 --> 12:09.731
and then on the back of it,
he actually wrote me a letter

12:09.765 --> 12:11.233
explaining what it is.

12:11.267 --> 12:13.367
Walt: "Dear Christian,
Sorry it took so long.

12:13.402 --> 12:15.638
"I've been so busy, I
forgot to return your books,

12:15.672 --> 12:17.574
"so I've sent you an original drawing.

12:17.609 --> 12:19.910
"This was done for issue 8,

12:19.945 --> 12:21.812
"but I decided to do it over.

12:21.847 --> 12:24.447
"That's why there are two covers.

12:24.481 --> 12:26.581
"Hope it was worth waiting for.

12:26.616 --> 12:28.483
Best, John Buscema."

12:28.518 --> 12:29.985
That's nice.

12:30.019 --> 12:31.587
So this is his first pass, you're saying?

12:31.621 --> 12:33.155
- Man: Right, yeah.
- Walt: And then he was like,

12:33.190 --> 12:34.657
"Ah, something's not sitting well with me.

12:34.692 --> 12:36.290
"I'm gonna go take another shot at it,"

12:36.324 --> 12:37.725
and that's the one he turned in to Marvel,

12:37.759 --> 12:40.430
- but he sent you the first pass.
- Man: Right.

12:40.464 --> 12:42.563
Walt: I-I can't imagine that happens often

12:42.598 --> 12:44.733
that, you know, an artist
will go that extra mile

12:44.767 --> 12:46.137
and be like, "Here, I'll give you a cover."

12:46.172 --> 12:47.440
Bryan: Not only would
I not give you a cover,

12:47.474 --> 12:48.675
I'd throw your comics away.

12:48.709 --> 12:50.508
[laughter]

12:50.543 --> 12:54.251
Mike: Back in the day,
wasn't the Hulk, like, 6'8"?

12:54.285 --> 12:56.121
And this would put
Wolverine at, like, six foot.

12:56.156 --> 12:57.421
Bryan: Isn't Wolvy tall, though?

12:57.456 --> 12:58.923
Or is he short? He's a short guy?

12:58.957 --> 13:00.258
Mike: No. Wolverine is supposed to be 5'4".

13:00.293 --> 13:01.460
Bryan: Oh, wow. I didn't know that.

13:01.495 --> 13:02.828
Mike: Yeah.

13:02.863 --> 13:04.329
Walt: Well, Hugh Jackman kind of, like...

13:04.363 --> 13:05.795
Bryan: Yeah, he doesn't look 5'4".

13:05.830 --> 13:07.530
Mike: No. He screwed it for everyone.

13:07.564 --> 13:09.298
It was supposed to be Danny
DeVito back in the '80s.

13:09.332 --> 13:10.933
Bryan: Wow. What a different
movie that would have been.

13:10.967 --> 13:12.335
[laughter]

13:12.370 --> 13:13.971
Kevin: Apparently when they

13:14.005 --> 13:16.107
were first putting
together a list of people

13:16.141 --> 13:17.609
who could play Wolverine,

13:17.643 --> 13:19.746
Danny DeVito's name wound up on it?

13:19.780 --> 13:23.551
Mike: Yeah, because Wolverine
is, like, 5'3 ", 5'4",

13:23.585 --> 13:25.221
they were looking for diminutive actors

13:25.255 --> 13:28.558
who could fill the role,
and his name was, like,

13:28.592 --> 13:29.891
on a short list,

13:29.925 --> 13:31.326
- and I remember...
- Kevin: No pun intended.

13:31.360 --> 13:32.995
Mike: No. Yeah. [laughter]

13:33.031 --> 13:35.199
And I remember seeing
someone had sketched a picture

13:35.234 --> 13:38.369
of Danny DeVito dressed up
like Wolverine with the claws.

13:38.404 --> 13:41.305
Kevin: I mean, I guess
based on the character alone,

13:41.340 --> 13:42.740
his character portrayal in Taxi,

13:42.775 --> 13:45.174
and also the roles he tends to take,

13:45.209 --> 13:46.709
the attitude is there,

13:46.744 --> 13:48.681
but I've never once looked at Danny DeVito

13:48.715 --> 13:50.484
and thought anything but Penguin.

13:50.518 --> 13:52.487
[laughter]

13:52.521 --> 13:54.391
Man: Well, for me, I think this is

13:54.426 --> 13:56.729
the definitive cover out of the two.

13:56.763 --> 13:58.429
I think that the drawing's better.

13:58.464 --> 14:00.229
I know that proportion-wise Wolverine's

14:00.263 --> 14:02.664
supposed to be smaller, but I
think it actually flows better,

14:02.699 --> 14:04.433
and it actually seems like
they're looking at each other,

14:04.468 --> 14:06.435
because in the one that
they actually published,

14:06.469 --> 14:08.335
I mean, they're so far apart

14:08.369 --> 14:10.268
that they can't have that sort
of buddy-buddy camaraderie thing

14:10.302 --> 14:12.035
like they're supposed to in the cover,

14:12.069 --> 14:14.503
and I think that's why
he did this originally.

14:14.538 --> 14:16.271
Walt: So are you looking to sell it today?

14:16.305 --> 14:18.537
Man: Yeah. I'm looking to
get, like, $3,500 for it.

14:18.571 --> 14:22.042
Walt: $3,500, huh? See, this
is one of those odd pieces,

14:22.077 --> 14:24.209
though, that it's not the published piece.

14:24.244 --> 14:25.510
Man: Oh, I know. I know.

14:25.544 --> 14:27.011
Walt: Well, would you take $1,600?

14:27.045 --> 14:29.848
Man: I could do, like, maybe, like, $2,800.

14:29.883 --> 14:32.953
Walt: $1,900.

14:32.987 --> 14:37.655
That's as... really as
high as I'm gonna, though.

14:37.689 --> 14:39.659
Man: I think I'm still
gonna pass on it, actually.

14:39.693 --> 14:40.860
- Walt: You sure?
- Man: Yeah.

14:40.894 --> 14:42.295
Walt: All right, man.

14:42.329 --> 14:43.896
Well, thanks for bringing it in, though.

14:43.931 --> 14:45.733
Man: Hey, thank you. I
appreciate it. Thanks a lot.

14:45.768 --> 14:49.139
Walt: You know, any day I can
look at a big John Buscema piece

14:49.173 --> 14:50.508
is a good day,

14:50.542 --> 14:52.912
even if I don't the chance to own it.

14:52.947 --> 14:54.582
- Thanks, though.
- Man: Hey, thanks a lot, guys.

14:54.616 --> 14:56.516
Walt: You got it.

15:06.432 --> 15:07.966
This is it, baby.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.633
Looking good, Ming.

15:22.950 --> 15:24.284
So it's the day of the concert.

15:24.318 --> 15:26.019
We roll into the PNC Arts Center.

15:26.053 --> 15:27.587
We do it up right.

15:27.622 --> 15:29.624
You know, let's make an impression,

15:29.658 --> 15:32.193
'cause I'm sure they'd never
seen KISS in makeup before.

15:32.228 --> 15:34.761
- [laughter]
- Kevin: It's crazy, man.

15:34.796 --> 15:37.166
The amount of, like,
guff you give cosplayers,

15:37.200 --> 15:38.767
but you're like, "But if it's KISS,

15:38.802 --> 15:41.367
"if it's in Satan's service, then, yes.

15:41.401 --> 15:43.939
- Cosplay in Satan's service."
- Walt: I'm a wreck.

15:43.974 --> 15:47.511
We have to find our contact, you know.

15:47.545 --> 15:49.880
Hi, excuse me.

15:49.915 --> 15:51.316
- Are you Matt?
- Matt: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:51.350 --> 15:52.651
Walt: Hi. Rob Bruce sent us.

15:52.685 --> 15:54.319
- How you doing?
- Matt: Oh, my... Yeah.

15:54.354 --> 15:55.788
- You look great.
- Bryan: How's it going?

15:55.822 --> 15:57.456
Matt: You already got your passes. Great.

15:57.491 --> 15:58.691
Walt: He said possibly you
may be able to hook us up?

15:58.725 --> 16:00.192
Matt: Yeah. Rob gave us a call.

16:00.226 --> 16:01.727
Gene's back in the green room right now.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.863
We'll go see if we can
pop in and say, "Hey."

16:03.897 --> 16:06.232
Come back this way. I'll
show you where it is.

16:13.441 --> 16:15.008
Mike: Mr. Simmons, it's an honor.

16:15.042 --> 16:16.508
Gene: Who are you guys?

16:16.543 --> 16:18.740
Walt: We work together
at a comic book store.

16:18.775 --> 16:20.142
Gene: How'd you guys get back here?

16:20.176 --> 16:22.346
Walt: Uh...

16:22.380 --> 16:25.780
- [explosion]
- [both screaming]

16:36.813 --> 16:38.448
Mike: Mr. Simmons, it's an honor.

Gene: Who are you guys?

16:39.983 --> 16:42.852
Walt: We work together
at a comic book store.

16:42.886 --> 16:45.623
Gene: How'd you guys get back here?

16:45.657 --> 16:48.026
Walt: Um, it's always been a dream of mine

16:48.060 --> 16:50.260
to be able to actually be
in the same room with you,

16:50.294 --> 16:53.628
so I could tell you just
how much you and KISS

16:53.663 --> 16:56.029
have meant to me my entire life.

16:56.064 --> 16:57.833
Gene: I appreciate it.

16:57.867 --> 16:59.832
Walt: Um, I bought this comic
book when I was nine years old,

16:59.866 --> 17:01.367
and that was the day I
fell in love with KISS.

17:01.401 --> 17:03.136
Gene: That's probably older than you are.

17:03.170 --> 17:05.605
Walt: No, I bought it when I
was nine years old off the rack

17:05.637 --> 17:07.503
in 1977.

17:07.538 --> 17:09.373
Bryan: That's a compliment. He
said you look good for your age.

17:09.407 --> 17:11.711
Gene: No, no. Actually,
I didn't say that at all.

17:11.746 --> 17:13.547
[laughter]

17:13.580 --> 17:17.286
Walt: I've always wanted to
get the KISS book signed by you.

17:17.319 --> 17:19.119
- Gene: Okay. Have you got a...
- Walt: I do.

17:19.154 --> 17:21.186
It's like one of those
out-of-body experiences.

17:21.221 --> 17:22.989
I'm looking down on me,
and I'm screaming at myself,

17:23.022 --> 17:24.223
"Say something, you moron."

17:24.258 --> 17:25.659
Kevin: And what did you spit out?

17:25.694 --> 17:27.292
"I was made for loving you!"

17:27.328 --> 17:30.160
[laughter]

17:30.195 --> 17:31.629
Gene: All jokes aside,

17:31.664 --> 17:33.966
you know that our blood
is in that comic book.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.701
Walt: Oh, I know it.

17:35.736 --> 17:38.237
Gene: We flew up with Stan Lee,
and we poured it in the red ink.

17:38.272 --> 17:39.972
So 1,000 years from now,

17:40.006 --> 17:42.645
they're gonna be able
to repopulate the Earth

17:42.679 --> 17:44.879
by taking an old copy of KISS comics,

17:44.914 --> 17:46.747
taking our DNA...

17:46.781 --> 17:48.914
<i>Bryan: Forget Jurassic Park.
You'll have KISS park.</i>

17:48.948 --> 17:50.315
- Gene: Planet KISS.
- Bryan: Yeah.

17:50.349 --> 17:52.384
Gene: Already trademarked.

17:52.418 --> 17:55.323
[laughter] I'm serious.

17:55.357 --> 17:57.926
Mike: So you're a huge
comic book fan I've read.

17:57.960 --> 17:59.361
Gene: Before you were born.

17:59.396 --> 18:01.498
In fact, as a fan,
as a 13-year-old boy,

18:01.532 --> 18:03.999
I used to send letters to Marvel.

18:04.033 --> 18:07.432
Stan Lee finally sent me a postcard,

18:07.467 --> 18:10.068
but on the bottom, he hand-wrote in,

18:10.102 --> 18:12.904
"You will do great things. Stan Lee."

18:12.938 --> 18:15.909
I thought it was, like,
some message from the gods.

18:15.943 --> 18:17.677
So I live it, breathe it.

18:17.711 --> 18:21.914
In fact, I have Simmons Comics,
and we have various KISS comics.

18:21.949 --> 18:23.282
We have lots of stuff.

18:23.317 --> 18:25.083
Walt: You're like a geek at heart.

18:25.118 --> 18:27.119
Like, the coolest rock star that
ever lived is actually a geek.

18:27.154 --> 18:29.024
Gene: Yeah, but, you know,
when you really think about it,

18:29.058 --> 18:32.128
all the stuff that we loved
that used to be kids' stuff,

18:32.163 --> 18:34.097
it rules the world now.

18:34.131 --> 18:38.772
It is the height of American
literature in the 20th century.

18:38.807 --> 18:40.975
Kevin: I mean, obviously, somebody in KISS

18:41.009 --> 18:44.112
was responsible for the very
comic book-y look and feel.

18:44.147 --> 18:45.582
He's something of a geek.

18:45.616 --> 18:46.950
Walt: I mean, he may
be the biggest rock star

18:46.985 --> 18:48.385
on the face of the planet,

18:48.419 --> 18:50.753
but deep down he's a nerd like me.

18:50.788 --> 18:52.924
