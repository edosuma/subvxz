WEBVTT

00:00.503 --> 00:03.271
<i>Kids, if there's one</i>
<i>big theme to this story--</i>

00:03.325 --> 00:05.426
<i>and I swear,</i>
<i>we're totally, almost,</i>

00:05.428 --> 00:07.928
<i>not really all that close</i>
<i>to the end-- it's timing.</i>

00:08.442 --> 00:09.739
<i>Timing is everything.</i>

00:09.764 --> 00:11.847
<i>For example, I never</i>
<i>would met your mother</i>

00:11.848 --> 00:13.280
<i>if it weren't for a wedding.</i>

00:13.282 --> 00:16.200
<i>The last wedding</i>
<i>I ever thought I'd be at.</i>

00:16.202 --> 00:18.869
What do you think of this tie?

00:18.871 --> 00:20.120
Oh, thank God.

00:20.122 --> 00:21.906
Barney Stinson needs you
right before his wedding,

00:21.908 --> 00:24.491
you assume there's at least
one dead hooker in the closet,

00:24.493 --> 00:25.525
right?

00:29.831 --> 00:32.082
Is this one better?

00:32.084 --> 00:34.585
Look, the tie is great, and,
you know, it's perfectly normal

00:34.587 --> 00:36.370
to have some
pre-wedding jitters.

00:36.372 --> 00:38.038
I'm not having jitters.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.557
It just occurs to me

00:39.559 --> 00:42.509
that once I put this tie on,
I can never take it off.

00:42.511 --> 00:45.346
I have to wear this tie
forever and ever.

00:45.348 --> 00:46.931
And sure, this tie's skinny now,

00:46.933 --> 00:49.650
but what happens if it gets fat
and starts bossing me around?

00:49.652 --> 00:51.185
Did I make a mistake?

00:51.187 --> 00:53.687
Would I have been happier
with the other tie?

00:55.240 --> 00:58.609
Ted, can I tell you
a big secret?

00:58.611 --> 01:00.578
Yeah, of course.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.948
I'm not really talking
about the tie.

01:03.950 --> 01:05.416
No, I got that, Barney.

01:05.418 --> 01:08.919
I wonder if this whole
thing's a disaster.

01:08.921 --> 01:11.705
What if this is
the worst wedding ever?

01:11.707 --> 01:12.873
Not possible.

01:12.875 --> 01:14.592
We've already been
to the worst wedding ever.

01:14.594 --> 01:16.710
Punchy's wedding.

01:16.712 --> 01:19.380
Marshall really took
a two flusher on that one.

01:19.382 --> 01:21.398
<i>The story of how</i>
<i>Uncle Marshall ruined</i>

01:21.400 --> 01:22.967
<i>my friend Punchy's wedding</i>

01:22.969 --> 01:25.019
<i>starts in September, 2011.</i>

01:25.021 --> 01:27.554
<i>Punchy had asked me</i>
<i>to be his best man.</i>

01:27.556 --> 01:28.606
Hey.
Hey.

01:28.608 --> 01:30.224
Guys, before we go,
would you mind

01:30.226 --> 01:31.558
reading my wedding toast?

01:31.560 --> 01:32.559
Oh, yeah, no problem.
Sure.

01:32.561 --> 01:33.894
Um, all right,
if I have to.

01:33.896 --> 01:36.113
All right.
Whoa.

01:36.931 --> 01:39.566
There's a few
different versions.

01:39.568 --> 01:41.952
Ted, why are you working
so hard on this toast?

01:41.954 --> 01:43.454
Punchy belched his proposal

01:43.456 --> 01:45.456
through a karaoke mic
at a bowling alley.

01:45.458 --> 01:47.408
Okay, look, I've never
told you guys this,

01:47.410 --> 01:50.911
but over the years, a few
of my old high school buddies

01:50.913 --> 01:53.163
have asked me
to give wedding toasts,

01:53.165 --> 01:57.468
and they haven't gone great.

01:57.470 --> 02:00.304
<i>Somehow those weddings</i>
<i>all fell smack-dab</i>

02:00.306 --> 02:02.473
<i>in the worst moments</i>
<i>of my life.</i>

02:02.475 --> 02:05.509
Joel and Mora's love
is a beautiful thing.

02:05.511 --> 02:08.612
I thought I had that...

02:08.614 --> 02:12.483
till my fiancée left me
at the altar last week.

02:12.485 --> 02:15.552
I was asked not to talk
about this, so I won't.

02:19.057 --> 02:22.092
I sit outside her house
at night sometimes.

02:22.094 --> 02:25.296
She got a haircut.

02:25.298 --> 02:27.531
After I lost my job last week,

02:27.533 --> 02:29.867
uh, I was asked not
to give this toast...

02:29.869 --> 02:31.335
No, no, no!

02:31.337 --> 02:33.203
The happy couple
needs to hear this.

02:33.205 --> 02:35.239
Things end.

02:35.241 --> 02:38.876
But from the ashes of your
statistically probable divorce,

02:38.878 --> 02:41.879
hope can rise anew.

02:43.249 --> 02:46.050
That is why I'm starting
my own architecture firm--

02:46.052 --> 02:47.951
Mosbius Designs.

02:47.953 --> 02:51.155
Mosbius Designs has failed.

02:51.157 --> 02:55.426
But Alex and Jessica's love
reminds us that...

02:57.062 --> 02:59.697
Oh, God!

03:01.649 --> 03:04.151
Classic Schmosby.

03:04.153 --> 03:07.905
Whoa. Punchy posted the low
points of your life online?

03:07.907 --> 03:09.490
Oh, not just that.

03:09.492 --> 03:12.692
♪ Mosbius Designs has failed ♪

03:12.694 --> 03:15.245

03:15.247 --> 03:18.031
♪ Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha... ♪

03:18.033 --> 03:20.901
Oh, God!

03:20.903 --> 03:23.837
So now I seem like
a total train wreck

03:23.839 --> 03:25.872
to all my old
high school friends.

03:25.874 --> 03:27.474
And a bunch of people
in Finland.

03:27.476 --> 03:30.511
The auto-tune thing got
kind of big over there.

03:30.513 --> 03:33.597
That's why I have
to nail this toast.

03:33.599 --> 03:36.483
Ted, you want to nail
something at this wedding--

03:36.485 --> 03:38.569
lose the Trapper Keeper.

03:38.571 --> 03:40.720
The only thing you need
to bring to Cleveland

03:40.722 --> 03:42.489
is this.

03:42.491 --> 03:43.807
<i>That fall I became</i>

03:43.809 --> 03:46.560
<i>the youngest architect</i>
<i>in the history of New York</i>

03:46.562 --> 03:48.195
<i>to break ground</i>
<i>on a skyscraper.</i>

03:48.197 --> 03:50.848
<i>Which led to a glowing</i>
<i>magazine feature.</i>

03:50.850 --> 03:52.332
I planned on having it framed--

03:52.334 --> 03:54.084
<i>Uncle Barney had</i>
<i>different plans.</i>

03:54.086 --> 03:55.536
Here's your toast--

03:55.538 --> 03:57.955
"Single file, ladies.
No fatties""

03:57.957 --> 03:59.456
That's ridiculous.

03:59.458 --> 04:00.839
Yeah, you're right.
It's Cleveland.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.741
"Single file, ladies""

04:03.788 --> 04:07.788

04:17.257 --> 04:19.091
I'm not going
to Punchy's wedding

04:19.094 --> 04:21.278
to brag about a magazine...

04:21.279 --> 04:23.280
cover.

04:23.282 --> 04:25.765
Barney, he doesn't need
dating advice from you.

04:25.767 --> 04:27.785
You never even called Nora.

04:27.787 --> 04:29.436
<i>Kids, you remember Nora.</i>

04:29.438 --> 04:31.905
<i>But just the other day...</i>

04:31.907 --> 04:35.075
I'll call you.
It's never too late, Barney.

04:35.077 --> 04:36.794
Or did you call her?

04:36.796 --> 04:38.612
Not that I care.
Did you?

04:38.614 --> 04:40.214
I don't care. Did you?

04:40.216 --> 04:42.416
I haven't called her.

04:42.418 --> 04:44.418
Buddy.
Damn it, Barney.

04:44.420 --> 04:46.119
I was really, really, really
rooting for you two.

04:46.121 --> 04:47.337
Who wants hot wings?

04:47.339 --> 04:48.555
I'm in.

04:48.557 --> 04:50.757
Or maybe we should just pour
hot sauce on Barney,

04:50.759 --> 04:52.142
since he's a total chicken.

04:52.144 --> 04:53.844
I did not chicken out.

04:53.846 --> 04:55.813
Nora is looking for
something serious.

04:55.815 --> 04:56.879
I'm not. End of story.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.856
And yes, Robin, I would
love some wings.

04:58.881 --> 05:00.081
Cannibal.

05:00.269 --> 05:01.902
Okay, next round's on me.

05:01.904 --> 05:03.337
Oh, no, we got it.
No, no...

05:03.339 --> 05:05.139
<i>Now Lily and Marshall</i>
<i>had just found out</i>

05:05.141 --> 05:06.640
<i>they were having a baby.</i>

05:06.642 --> 05:09.493
I can't wait to tell everyone.
Baby, no,

05:09.495 --> 05:11.912
we can't tell anyone.
Not until three months.

05:11.914 --> 05:13.313
I don't want to jinx it.

05:13.315 --> 05:15.499
That's a bit superstitious,
don't you think?

05:15.501 --> 05:18.452
Whenever we board a flight,
you lick the plane.

05:18.454 --> 05:20.037
Have we crashed
even once?

05:20.039 --> 05:23.340
Don't say a word until we
know everything's okay. Deal?

05:23.342 --> 05:26.293
Deal. But everything's
just going to be great.

05:26.295 --> 05:28.295
I promise.

05:28.297 --> 05:30.464
How can you guarantee that?

05:32.433 --> 05:34.885
Come here.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.940
I'm just so happy.
I don't know how

05:39.942 --> 05:42.609
we're going to keep this secret
for three months.

05:42.611 --> 05:43.977
Relax. It'll be easy.

05:43.979 --> 05:46.012
What'll you have?

05:46.014 --> 05:48.115
Four beers, plus
one non-alcoholic.

05:48.117 --> 05:51.768
You're pregnant!
Get in here!

05:51.770 --> 05:53.620
<i>And so we all headed</i>
<i>to my hometown</i>

05:53.622 --> 05:55.021
<i>where we planned to celebrate</i>

05:55.023 --> 05:56.290
<i>Punchy's big day.</i>

05:56.292 --> 05:57.941
<i>Uncle Barney had</i>
<i>different plans.</i>

05:57.943 --> 05:59.326
Get ready, Cleveland.

05:59.328 --> 06:01.161
The last man to
screw you this hard

06:01.163 --> 06:03.130
then disappear
was LeBron James.

06:03.132 --> 06:06.250
You're trying
to get laid here?

06:06.252 --> 06:08.552
What?
God, Barney,

06:08.554 --> 06:09.920
tonight is a magical night

06:09.922 --> 06:11.889
between Ted's annoying
friend and what's-her-face.

06:11.891 --> 06:13.090
Have some respect.

06:13.092 --> 06:15.041
This isn't just getting laid.

06:15.043 --> 06:16.710
This is market research.

06:16.712 --> 06:21.047
You see, my legendary
success rate of 83%...

06:21.049 --> 06:23.183
17-- it's always
the inverse.

06:23.185 --> 06:24.985
...doesn't happen by accident.

06:24.987 --> 06:27.070
Every single play
I run on women

06:27.072 --> 06:28.605
has been
meticulously field-tested.

06:28.607 --> 06:29.940
By weeding out

06:29.942 --> 06:32.892
the bad plays in smaller markets
like Cleveland,

06:32.894 --> 06:35.061
I know which ones will work
in New York.

06:35.063 --> 06:36.029
For example,

06:36.031 --> 06:38.398
tonight marks
the inaugural flight

06:38.400 --> 06:40.751
of the escaped manslaughterer.

06:41.703 --> 06:43.787
Are escaped
manslaughterers sexy?

06:43.789 --> 06:44.904
Not even remotely.
No. No.

06:44.906 --> 06:47.574
Exactly.
We'll never know unless

06:47.576 --> 06:48.792
I try it out tonight.

06:48.794 --> 06:50.460
Schmosby!
Oh!

06:50.462 --> 06:53.180
Turd-faces! What's up?!

06:53.182 --> 06:54.932
You really feel
that ring now.

06:54.934 --> 06:56.416
So glad you all made it.

06:56.418 --> 06:58.685
Open bar. Drink up,
turd-faces,

06:58.687 --> 07:00.854
'cause Kelly's dad's
paying for all this,

07:00.856 --> 07:03.140
and he hates my guts.

07:03.142 --> 07:04.558
It's true.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.643
Who's doing shots?
Come on, let's go.

07:06.645 --> 07:07.927
Oh, no, thank you.

07:07.929 --> 07:09.179
What are you pregnant
or something?

07:09.181 --> 07:10.480
Let's get hammered!

07:12.117 --> 07:13.767
You're drinking
for two tonight, baby.

07:13.769 --> 07:17.204
I will do this for the child.

07:17.206 --> 07:19.272
- Go Browns!
- Go Browns!

07:19.274 --> 07:21.825
In AFC regular season play,

07:21.827 --> 07:24.294
but if they mean the
Super Bowl, go Vikings.

07:24.296 --> 07:25.796
Yowza!

07:26.999 --> 07:29.666
Escaped manslaughterers--
not sexy.

07:29.668 --> 07:31.501
Although in hindsight,

07:31.503 --> 07:34.004
that was kind
of a flawed concept.

07:34.006 --> 07:36.456
Next up, patient zero.

07:39.978 --> 07:42.729
Lily, we are getting
sloshed tonight.

07:43.681 --> 07:44.798
That's all you, baby.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.733
I'll be four shots in
with no food.

07:46.735 --> 07:49.398
In nine months, I'll be pushing
a pumpkin-headed Eriksen baby

07:49.423 --> 07:50.623
out of my hoo-ha.

07:51.106 --> 07:53.357
I think Papa can manage
a few extra cocktails.

07:53.359 --> 07:55.158
Well played.

07:59.914 --> 08:01.498
Hakuna Matata!

08:01.500 --> 08:04.751
I, uh, I got
to get some air.

08:06.671 --> 08:08.822
<i>Kids, remember how I told you</i>

08:08.824 --> 08:11.074
<i>Marshall ruined</i>
<i>Punchy's wedding?</i>

08:11.076 --> 08:12.342
<i>That wasn't it.</i>

08:12.344 --> 08:14.645
God, will you look
at that guy.

08:14.647 --> 08:17.014
I wish Barney

08:17.016 --> 08:18.382
were my boyfriend again.

08:18.384 --> 08:19.716
No, thanks.

08:19.718 --> 08:21.558
Wait a minute.
That's your truth voice.

08:21.583 --> 08:22.783
My what?

08:23.355 --> 08:25.772
Whenever you're trying to pass
something off as a joke

08:25.774 --> 08:29.126
but it's actually profoundly
true, you use that voice.

08:29.128 --> 08:32.010
I wish the Spice Girls
would get back together.

08:32.013 --> 08:33.647
They were awesome.

08:33.649 --> 08:35.448
The worst.

08:39.821 --> 08:41.871
That was me.

08:41.874 --> 08:44.357
I totally cut one.

08:44.359 --> 08:47.360
That guy.

08:47.362 --> 08:49.746
Birthday present
from my dad.

08:49.748 --> 08:50.992
All I really want is for him

08:51.017 --> 08:52.817
to tell me that he loves me.

08:53.752 --> 08:55.085
Just kidding.

08:55.087 --> 08:56.420
This pen's enough.

08:56.422 --> 08:58.204
It's not enough.

08:58.206 --> 09:00.373
It's totally enough.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.310
Oh, my God.

09:03.312 --> 09:06.763
You still have
feelings for Barney.

09:09.180 --> 09:12.447
Admit it, you still have
feelings for Barney.

09:12.476 --> 09:15.377
You are drunker than I thought.

09:15.379 --> 09:16.345
I mean,

09:16.347 --> 09:18.564
look at the guy.
Wait, wait, wait.

09:18.566 --> 09:21.216
Before you go, please answer
the following survey

09:21.218 --> 09:23.269
to help me better
bang you in the future.

09:23.271 --> 09:26.438
What didn't work for you
about this play?

09:26.440 --> 09:27.940
Did you A) not believe

09:27.942 --> 09:30.693
I was a <i>Guinness Book</i>
world record holder?

09:30.695 --> 09:34.330
or B) did the fingernails
gross you out?

09:34.332 --> 09:36.365
Th...

09:36.367 --> 09:38.617
I can't wait for
your toast, Schmosby.

09:38.619 --> 09:41.069
Yeah, here come
the waterworks.

09:41.071 --> 09:43.706
Wait. You're rooting for me to
melt down at your own wedding?

09:43.708 --> 09:45.090
Yeah, everyone is.

09:45.092 --> 09:47.176
Plus a few new friends
from Finland.

09:50.580 --> 09:51.964
Hey, good luck, Schmos.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.799
Good luck, good luck.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.935
Take it.

09:55.937 --> 09:58.187
Show them how awesome you are.

09:58.189 --> 10:02.858
Shamelessly plug yourself,
so you can shamelessly plug,

10:02.860 --> 10:04.977
let's say that.
I told you,

10:04.979 --> 10:06.695
I'm not here to brag, okay?

10:06.697 --> 10:08.030
That's it.

10:08.032 --> 10:10.115
You're too polite to brag.

10:10.117 --> 10:11.867
Well, fine.

10:11.869 --> 10:13.402
Let me.

10:13.404 --> 10:16.538
Because the only person
on Earth

10:16.540 --> 10:18.791
who loves Ted Mosby
more than Marshall Eriksen,

10:18.793 --> 10:21.243
is drunk Marshall Eriksen.

10:21.245 --> 10:22.995
So game on.

10:28.501 --> 10:30.653
<i>Kids, remember how I told you</i>

10:30.655 --> 10:33.188
<i>Marshall ruined Punchy</i>
<i>and Kelly's wedding?</i>

10:34.674 --> 10:36.792
<i>That wasn't it either.</i>

10:36.794 --> 10:39.979
Barney and I tried and failed.

10:39.981 --> 10:41.296
That was two years ago.

10:41.298 --> 10:43.465
Why would I ever
go down that road again?

10:43.467 --> 10:44.900
It wouldn't even
make sense.

10:44.902 --> 10:47.319
It doesn't have to make sense.
It's chemistry.

10:47.321 --> 10:51.273
Look, I've always had a sixth
sense about these things.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.158
And now that I'm pregnant...

10:53.160 --> 10:55.995
with this idea
in my mind-uterus,

10:55.997 --> 10:57.312
I see things
even clearer.

10:57.314 --> 11:00.249
You and Barney have the kind
of chemistry

11:00.251 --> 11:02.584
that just doesn't go away.

11:02.586 --> 11:07.456
Really? Then why is he trying
to LeBron anything that moves?

11:07.458 --> 11:08.674
Did this not work for you

11:08.676 --> 11:10.492
because A) vampires
are played out,

11:10.494 --> 11:13.462
or B) claiming that I also
invented Facebook

11:13.464 --> 11:16.215
was kind of a hat on a hat?

11:18.151 --> 11:19.668
You're the reason

11:19.670 --> 11:21.169
he never called Nora.

11:21.171 --> 11:23.505
You're the reason he's only
test-marketing tonight.

11:23.507 --> 11:25.274
And you're the
reason he keeps

11:25.276 --> 11:27.059
striking out on purpose.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.494
Chemistry.

11:29.362 --> 11:31.897
Whoa! Ted!

11:31.899 --> 11:33.699
Is that really you

11:33.701 --> 11:36.685
on the cover of
<i>New York</i> magazine?

11:36.687 --> 11:38.203
Now, you say "yes""

11:38.205 --> 11:40.322
Please stop.
Schmosby.

11:40.324 --> 11:41.373
What's this about a magazine?

11:41.375 --> 11:43.325
You know what, Clay?
It's no big deal.

11:43.327 --> 11:45.461
You know what?
It is a big deal.

11:45.463 --> 11:50.249
Clay, my friend Ted is
designing a skyscraper, Clay.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.884
What have you been
up to, Clay?

11:51.886 --> 11:54.386
Well, I'm still working
at the rental car company...

11:54.388 --> 11:56.004
Bravo, bravo, Clay.

11:56.006 --> 11:59.040
Any major publications
want to write an article

11:59.042 --> 12:01.060
on your sweet
rental car gig?

12:01.062 --> 12:02.511
No, no articles.

12:02.513 --> 12:03.512
My life's pretty dull.

12:03.514 --> 12:07.716
I guess the only news is
this little gal.

12:07.718 --> 12:10.102
Oh, my God,
wook at the wittle baby.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.854
She is so cute.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.723
All I want to do
is put her little feet

12:14.725 --> 12:17.392
in my mouth.

12:17.394 --> 12:19.561
You've created something
truly beautiful.

12:19.563 --> 12:21.580
She is my everything.

12:21.582 --> 12:25.400
I mean, it's kind
of a big deal...

12:25.402 --> 12:26.735
the building,
you know?

12:26.737 --> 12:28.237
Hey, little one.

12:28.239 --> 12:29.872
So, this little angel's
already sleeping

12:29.874 --> 12:30.906
through the night?

12:30.908 --> 12:32.791
I've had some
sleepless nights...

12:32.793 --> 12:35.677
designing this building.

12:35.679 --> 12:38.180
Aw...

12:38.182 --> 12:40.466
Nothing symbolic
about that.

12:41.468 --> 12:43.051
Let it go.

12:43.053 --> 12:45.637
There is no chemistry left
between me and Barney.

12:45.639 --> 12:46.755
We're done.

12:46.757 --> 12:49.641
Oh really? Prove it.
Go tell him.

12:49.643 --> 12:51.059
Why would I go
tell him that?

12:51.061 --> 12:54.563
Because deep down, even if he
isn't aware of it himself,

12:54.565 --> 12:56.715
Barney wants to be with you.

12:56.717 --> 12:58.150
And if it's not
gonna happen,

12:58.152 --> 12:59.768
he deserves to know.

12:59.770 --> 13:01.086
Fine.

13:04.190 --> 13:07.242
Barney, just so everything
is crystal clear...

13:07.244 --> 13:08.794
I know what you're gonna say.

13:08.796 --> 13:11.797
Let's show Cleveland how
it's done.

13:12.832 --> 13:15.634
♪ The chills that you spill
up my back ♪

13:15.636 --> 13:17.252

14:34.965 --> 14:37.332
Barney... I...

14:39.202 --> 14:41.753
Sorry.

14:43.723 --> 14:46.191
Oh, my God, it's Nora.

14:50.409 --> 14:51.943
Nora's finally
calling me back.

14:51.945 --> 14:53.361
Wait, you said you
never called her.

14:53.363 --> 14:55.580
I lied. I called her,
like, five times.

14:55.582 --> 14:57.165
Wait, wait!

14:57.167 --> 14:59.117
You of all people
know how much

14:59.119 --> 15:02.003
I suck at these things.
You gotta help me. Please?

15:02.005 --> 15:03.204
Just once I would like

15:03.206 --> 15:05.039
to see what it feels like
to not screw things up.

15:05.041 --> 15:07.208
Yeah, mm-hmm.

15:07.210 --> 15:08.659
Okay.

15:08.661 --> 15:11.296
Hey, Nora.
Thanks for calling me back.

15:11.298 --> 15:15.666
Um, hey, hi.
The-the-the reason that, um,

15:15.668 --> 15:17.168
I called is, uh...

15:17.170 --> 15:18.936
To tell you how
I feel about you.

15:18.938 --> 15:20.338
...to tell you how
I feel about you.

15:20.340 --> 15:21.973
I know we didn't work
out the first time...

15:21.975 --> 15:23.808
I know we didn't work out
the first time...

15:23.810 --> 15:25.443
...and I know it doesn't
make any sense...

15:25.445 --> 15:27.228
...and I know it doesn't
make any sense...

15:27.230 --> 15:29.731
...but I can't shake the feeling
that we belong together.

15:29.733 --> 15:31.149
...but I can't shake
this feeling

15:31.151 --> 15:32.233
that we belong together.

15:32.235 --> 15:34.986
Is there any part of you
that wants to try again?

15:34.988 --> 15:37.521
Is there any part of you
that wants to try again?

15:44.963 --> 15:47.281
Baby, I can't take it anymore.

15:47.283 --> 15:49.033
I've gotta tell somebody
that we're pregnant.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.301
Eriksen, stay strong.

15:50.303 --> 15:51.886
We're keeping this secret.

15:51.888 --> 15:53.388
There's babies everywhere.

15:53.390 --> 15:54.972
It's like a minefield
of cuteness.

15:54.974 --> 15:56.474
Look at this little bastard.

15:56.476 --> 15:58.810
Marshall, stop it.
Stay strong.

15:58.812 --> 16:02.213
You can't let holding some,
some little baby...

16:02.215 --> 16:05.316
oh, with the cute
little cheeks

16:05.318 --> 16:07.485
and the... the little arms

16:07.487 --> 16:09.020
and little legs...

16:09.022 --> 16:12.073
This son of a bitch
has knee dimples.

16:12.075 --> 16:13.741
Let's go tell everyone
I'm pregnant.

16:13.743 --> 16:15.193
Yeah!

16:35.247 --> 16:36.347
You okay?

16:36.349 --> 16:37.632
Nope. You?

16:37.634 --> 16:39.801
Not excessively.

16:39.803 --> 16:40.935
You want to talk
about it?

16:40.937 --> 16:42.420
Not even a little.

16:42.422 --> 16:45.556
Might make you feel better.

16:45.558 --> 16:48.443
Okay, fine,
I'll make you a deal:

16:48.445 --> 16:51.946
you go first, and then I'll
stick with my thing

16:51.948 --> 16:53.448
about not talking about it.

16:53.450 --> 16:55.800
Okay.

16:56.869 --> 16:58.069
All my friends from high school,

16:58.071 --> 16:59.871
they're here with their wives,
their kids.

16:59.873 --> 17:03.607
Me? My date for the night
is a sticky magazine.

17:03.609 --> 17:06.160
Sounds like high school
all over again.

17:06.162 --> 17:07.795
Sorry, it was right there.

17:09.765 --> 17:12.666
I used to believe in destiny,
you know?

17:12.669 --> 17:16.587
I'd go to the bagel place,
see a pretty girl in line

17:16.589 --> 17:19.557
reading my favorite novel,
whistling the song

17:19.559 --> 17:21.976
that's been stuck in my head
all week and I'd think,

17:21.978 --> 17:25.262
"Wow. Hey, maybe she's
the one."

17:25.948 --> 17:27.647
Now I think, "I just know

17:27.650 --> 17:28.966
"that bitch is gonna take

17:28.968 --> 17:30.685
the last whole-wheat everything
bagel."

17:30.687 --> 17:33.020
You've just been focused
on work.

17:33.022 --> 17:37.074
No, it's more than that.

17:37.076 --> 17:39.477
I've stopped believing.

17:40.279 --> 17:41.696
Not in some depressed,

17:41.698 --> 17:44.165
"I'm gonna cry
during my toast" way.

17:44.167 --> 17:46.667
Not in a way I even noticed
until tonight.

17:46.669 --> 17:53.157
It's just, every day,
I think I believe a little less

17:53.159 --> 17:55.493
and a little less
and a little less.

17:55.495 --> 17:58.479
And that... sucks.

18:00.665 --> 18:03.634
What do I do
about that, Scherbatsky?

18:03.636 --> 18:05.336
You're Ted Mosby.

18:05.338 --> 18:07.355
You start believing again.

18:07.357 --> 18:10.141
In what, destiny?

18:10.143 --> 18:12.860
Chemistry.

18:13.962 --> 18:16.314
If you have chemistry,
you only need one other thing.

18:16.316 --> 18:17.532
What's that?

18:17.534 --> 18:19.016
Timing.

18:19.635 --> 18:21.686
But timing's a bitch.

18:24.173 --> 18:27.625
Hey, we still have
our 40 deal, right?

18:27.627 --> 18:29.160
If we're both still
single at 40...

18:29.162 --> 18:31.028
I'm all yours.
Hmm

18:31.030 --> 18:34.081
Unrelated, do architects make
big money?

18:34.083 --> 18:36.667
Aggressively
medium money.

18:36.669 --> 18:39.720
Damn it.

18:39.722 --> 18:41.522
Schmosby, you're up
in two minutes.

18:43.208 --> 18:44.559
Okay, promise me two things,

18:44.561 --> 18:46.511
one) you start believing again,

18:46.513 --> 18:50.615
and two) don't cry
during the toast, Schmosby.

18:50.617 --> 18:53.050
I promise.

18:53.052 --> 18:54.819
Good.

18:57.556 --> 18:59.740
We're having a baby.

18:59.742 --> 19:01.409
What, for real?

19:01.411 --> 19:02.527
For real.

19:02.529 --> 19:03.578
Oh!
Oh!

19:05.698 --> 19:07.231
Attention, everyone!

19:07.233 --> 19:09.083
It's time for the reason
we're all here tonight.

19:09.085 --> 19:11.836
Schmosby's toast!

19:11.838 --> 19:14.388
We're here tonight
to celebrate love.

19:17.694 --> 19:19.794
Love brings us new life...

19:21.264 --> 19:22.930
Hey!

19:26.852 --> 19:28.786
This isn't a meltdown.

19:29.605 --> 19:31.639
These are tears of joy.

19:31.641 --> 19:36.093
Ted is happy for his friends

19:36.095 --> 19:39.146
'cause he's the best guy
that I know.

19:39.148 --> 19:40.448
And do you know why he's happy?

19:40.450 --> 19:43.267
Because this beautiful lady
right here is pregnant.

19:43.269 --> 19:44.702
How did you know that?!

19:44.704 --> 19:46.904
That was supposed
to be a secret!

19:46.906 --> 19:49.006
<i>Turns out...</i>

19:49.008 --> 19:49.957
Go Browns!

19:49.959 --> 19:52.326
Go Browns!
Whoo!

19:52.328 --> 19:53.777
In AFC regular season play,

19:53.779 --> 19:55.796
but if they mean the
Super Bowl, go Vikings.

19:55.798 --> 19:57.448
How dare you.

19:57.450 --> 19:59.800
That's my daughter,
you piece of garbage.

19:59.802 --> 20:01.769
You're still gonna pay
for all this, right?

20:01.771 --> 20:04.672
"Piece of garbage"?
That's my son.

20:04.674 --> 20:08.109
<i>And that is how Marshall</i>
<i>destroyed Punchy's wedding.</i>

20:09.479 --> 20:11.462
<i>But we didn't care.</i>

20:11.464 --> 20:15.516
<i>There was gonna be a sixth</i>
<i>member of our little family.</i>

20:17.369 --> 20:19.487
No wedding will ever,
ever be as bad

20:19.489 --> 20:21.772
as that one, right?

20:21.774 --> 20:24.825
I picked the right tie,
didn't I?

20:24.827 --> 20:27.328
You nailed it.

20:27.330 --> 20:30.848
And hey, just be glad
it's not the ducky tie.

20:30.850 --> 20:32.266
<i>Ooh, the ducky tie.</i>

20:32.268 --> 20:34.468
<i>That's a good story kids.</i>
<i>I'll get to that.</i>

20:34.470 --> 20:37.204
<i>Man, we are not even close</i>
<i>to the end.</i>

20:39.492 --> 20:42.059
You're a good
best man, Ted.

20:43.045 --> 20:45.096
You're gonna cry during
the toast, aren't you?

20:45.098 --> 20:45.996
Oh, I'm totally gonna cry.

20:45.998 --> 20:47.882
Come in.

20:49.718 --> 20:51.385
Ted, the bride wants to see you.

20:52.688 --> 20:54.605
Okay.

20:56.942 --> 20:58.609
Really? You're gonna go
with that tie?
