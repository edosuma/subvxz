00:25.575 --> 00:29.677
And with that movie <i>2001,</i>
you're projecting us into the 21st century.

00:29.678 --> 00:31.679
- I brought along my son Jonathan...
- Hi.

00:31.680 --> 00:35.417
Who in the year 2001 will
be the same age as I am now.

00:35.418 --> 00:40.521
Maybe he will be better adjusted to this
kind of world that you're trying to portray.

00:40.522 --> 00:42.490
The big difference,
when he grows up...

00:42.491 --> 00:44.660
In fact, if we wanted to
wait till the year 2001...

00:44.661 --> 00:47.762
He will have in his own house

00:47.763 --> 00:50.966
not a computer as big as
this, but at least a console

00:50.967 --> 00:54.670
through which he can talk to
his friendly local computer

00:54.671 --> 00:56.972
and get all the information
he needs for his everyday life,

00:56.973 --> 01:00.508
like his bank statements,
his theater reservations,

01:00.509 --> 01:05.948
all the information you need in the course
of living in a complex modern society.

01:05.949 --> 01:10.052
This will be in a compact
form in his own house.

01:10.053 --> 01:13.421
He'll have a television screen,
like these here, and a keyboard.

01:13.422 --> 01:15.790
And he'll talk to the computer
and get information from it.

01:15.791 --> 01:18.560
And he'll take it as much for
granted as we take the telephone.

01:18.561 --> 01:21.829
I wonder, though, what sort of
a life would it be like in social terms?

01:21.830 --> 01:24.566
I mean, if our whole life
is built around the computer,

01:24.567 --> 01:26.668
do we become a computer-dependent society?

01:26.669 --> 01:29.704
In some ways, but they
will also enrich our society

01:29.705 --> 01:33.508
because it will make it possible for
us to live, really, anywhere we like.

01:33.509 --> 01:38.346
Any businessman and executive
could live almost anywhere on Earth

01:38.347 --> 01:40.948
and still do his business
through a device like this.

01:40.949 --> 01:44.552
And this is a wonderful thing. It means
we won't have to be stuck in cities.

01:44.553 --> 01:48.357
We'll be able to live out in the
country or wherever we please.

01:52.928 --> 01:54.930
<i>Screen says it's
an unimplemented trap.</i>

01:54.931 --> 01:57.533
<i>But the error code is
wrong. It's a system error.</i>

01:57.534 --> 01:59.734
<i>- So what's the upshot?
- It's not gonna say hello.</i>

01:59.735 --> 02:01.170
<i>It absolutely
is gonna say hello.</i>

02:01.171 --> 02:03.638
<i>- It's nobody's fault. It's a system error.
- You built the voice demo.</i>

02:03.639 --> 02:05.674
- The voice demo is flaky.
- Keep your voices down.

02:05.675 --> 02:07.742
I've been telling you that
for... This thing is overbuilt.

02:07.743 --> 02:10.011
It worked last night. It
worked the night before that.

02:10.012 --> 02:11.347
It worked three hours ago.

02:11.348 --> 02:14.483
- It's not working now, so just skip over the voice demo.
- Fuck you.

02:14.484 --> 02:15.818
- Everything else is working.
- Shh.

02:15.819 --> 02:17.519
Skip over the voice demo.

02:17.520 --> 02:19.021
We need it to say hello.

02:19.022 --> 02:22.623
- You're not hearing me. It's not going to say hello.
- Just fix it.

02:22.624 --> 02:23.925
- Fix it?
- Yeah.

02:26.629 --> 02:27.763
- In 40 minutes?
- Fix it.

02:27.764 --> 02:29.630
- I can't.
- Who's the person who can?

02:29.631 --> 02:32.335
I'm the person who can, and I can't.

02:34.069 --> 02:35.636
- How bad are you saying?
- It's pretty bad.

02:35.637 --> 02:39.441
- I don't know what that means.
- It means the demo is more than likely gonna crash.

02:39.442 --> 02:40.842
You have to keep your voices down.

02:40.843 --> 02:42.878
Joel Pforzheimer is
sitting out in the house.

02:42.879 --> 02:45.447
I don't care if... Who's Joel Pforzheimer?

02:45.448 --> 02:46.914
<i>GQ.</i>

02:46.915 --> 02:49.617
He's been shadowing you
for a week. Did you notice?

02:49.618 --> 02:51.486
Just look like everything's fine.

02:51.487 --> 02:53.889
He's sitting out in the house.

02:53.890 --> 02:55.425
Hey.

02:56.725 --> 02:59.128
What are you guys saying?

02:59.129 --> 03:02.698
Some kind of race condition, but we
haven't been able to track it down yet.

03:02.699 --> 03:04.165
Is the synthesizer sampling fast enough?

03:04.166 --> 03:06.901
No, so the rates are off
and it keeps crashing.

03:06.902 --> 03:09.872
It's 20 seconds out of a
two-hour launch. Why not just cut it?

03:09.873 --> 03:11.507
- We can't cut it.
- Yeah, you just cut it.

03:11.508 --> 03:15.510
Two days ago, we ran a Super Bowl ad that
could've won the Oscar for Best Short Film.

03:15.511 --> 03:18.880
There are more people who can tell you about
the ad than can tell you who won the game.

03:18.881 --> 03:21.749
I understand, but the ad said
the Mac was gonna save the world.

03:21.750 --> 03:23.885
It didn't say it was gonna say hello.

03:23.886 --> 03:25.687
We open the house in five.

03:25.688 --> 03:28.157
Don't open the house.

03:28.158 --> 03:29.724
We're taking a quick break.

03:29.725 --> 03:31.259
- Part of the problem is...
- What?

03:31.260 --> 03:35.431
We can recompile, but if it's a hardware
problem, we can't get into the back.

03:35.432 --> 03:36.998
Why not?

03:36.999 --> 03:39.835
- Do you wanna tell her or should I?
- Don't start with me, man.

03:39.836 --> 03:42.204
- Why can't he get into the machine?
- You need special tools.

03:42.205 --> 03:44.806
What kind of special tools?
Just take a screwdriver.

03:44.807 --> 03:46.842
He didn't want users to be able to open it.

03:46.843 --> 03:49.812
You need special tools.

03:49.813 --> 03:51.347
Is this for real?

03:51.348 --> 03:54.483
There are a hundred engineers walking
around here. None of them have the tools?

03:54.484 --> 03:56.985
In fairness, not many of
them were issued the tools.

03:56.986 --> 04:01.156
- What about you?
- I left them at the office. It was 3:00 AM when I...

04:01.157 --> 04:02.758
Oh, Jesus Christ.

04:02.759 --> 04:04.826
- Cut "Hello."
- No.

04:04.827 --> 04:07.028
- What's the first rule of a launch?
- It's not gonna crash.

04:07.029 --> 04:08.597
It just did.

04:08.598 --> 04:09.664
Andy!

04:09.665 --> 04:11.532
Which one?

04:11.533 --> 04:13.701
The other Andy. You're right
there. Why would I be calling out?

04:13.702 --> 04:15.069
- He needs to talk to you.
- Yeah.

04:15.070 --> 04:18.240
The exit signs need to be off or
we're not gonna get a full blackout.

04:18.241 --> 04:21.009
- We've spoken to the building manager and the fire marshal.
- And?

04:21.010 --> 04:23.077
There's no way they're gonna
let us turn the exit signs off.

04:23.078 --> 04:25.247
I'll pay whatever the fine is.

04:25.248 --> 04:27.615
The fine is they're gonna come
in and tell everyone to leave.

04:27.616 --> 04:29.884
You explained to the fire marshal
that we're in here changing the world?

04:29.885 --> 04:33.855
I did, but unless we can also change
the properties of fire, he doesn't care.

04:33.856 --> 04:36.492
- Steve...
- If a fire causes a stampede to the unmarked exits,

04:36.493 --> 04:38.894
it'll have been well worth
it for those who survive.

04:38.895 --> 04:41.497
For those who don't, less
so, but still pretty good.

04:41.498 --> 04:44.199
- Look, I...
- I need it to go black. Real black.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.134
Get rid of the exit signs and
don't let me know how you did it.

04:47.135 --> 04:49.539
Fix the voice demo.

04:52.976 --> 04:55.511
You need special tools to open the Mac?

04:55.512 --> 04:57.278
You knew it was a closed system.

04:57.279 --> 04:59.915
I didn't know literally. Jesus.

04:59.916 --> 05:02.117
And if you keep alienating
people for no reason,

05:02.118 --> 05:04.752
there's gonna be no one
left for it to say hello to.

05:04.753 --> 05:06.120
It's not for no reason.

05:06.121 --> 05:09.658
We blow this and IBM will own the
next 50 years like a Batman villain.

05:09.659 --> 05:12.995
Remember the phone company? That's what
Bell was called, "the phone company."

05:12.996 --> 05:15.062
IBM will be the computer company.

05:15.063 --> 05:17.766
Ten years later they'll
be the information company,

05:17.767 --> 05:20.168
and that's very bad for the human race.

05:20.169 --> 05:22.971
So we don't have time to
be polite or realistic,

05:22.972 --> 05:25.540
'cause if we are, this
company's next product launch

05:25.541 --> 05:27.108
will be held in front of 26 people

05:27.109 --> 05:29.944
and a stringer from the
Alameda County Shopper's Guide.

05:29.945 --> 05:32.047
We haven't advertised the voice software.

05:32.048 --> 05:35.951
We could pull it out of the demo
and no one would be disappointed.

05:35.952 --> 05:38.052
Do you want to try being reasonable,

05:38.053 --> 05:42.291
just, you know, see what it feels like?

05:43.792 --> 05:48.096
Okay. Pull the voice demo.

05:48.097 --> 05:49.031
Thank you.

05:49.032 --> 05:51.165
And then cancel the launch.

05:51.166 --> 05:52.668
I see. You just tricked me a little.

05:52.669 --> 05:56.305
You can tell me how unimportant it is,
but if the computer doesn't say hello,

05:56.306 --> 06:00.041
then neither will John Sculley,
who I promise you agrees with me.

06:00.042 --> 06:03.711
Sculley's not gonna cancel the
launch 'cause he's not insane.

06:03.712 --> 06:05.947
He's also not a hack, and
when it comes to the Macintosh,

06:05.948 --> 06:07.649
he's gonna do what I ask him to do.

06:07.650 --> 06:10.185
- What's in this box?
- Nothing you need to worry about.

06:10.186 --> 06:11.720
Don't even open it.

06:11.721 --> 06:13.754
What the fuck?

06:13.755 --> 06:16.692
Why is there a carton of... Who did this?

06:16.693 --> 06:18.427
- Somebody thought...
- Who?

06:18.428 --> 06:22.697
Doesn't matter. Thought it would be a good
idea to have copies of that <i>Time</i> cover

06:22.698 --> 06:24.233
available at everyone's seat.

06:24.234 --> 06:27.302
It was nipped in the bud and all the
copies are being taken out of the building.

06:27.303 --> 06:28.937
So problem solved.

06:28.938 --> 06:31.872
- This isn't a Macintosh.
- I understand.

06:31.873 --> 06:33.975
Somebody thought it would
be a good idea to, like,

06:33.976 --> 06:38.747
enthusiastically hand over copies of
<i>Time</i> with a not-a-Macintosh on the cover

06:38.748 --> 06:40.382
at the launch of the Macintosh?

06:40.383 --> 06:42.283
What are they handing
out at Hewlett-Packard?

06:42.284 --> 06:44.286
A bushel of apples with my face on them?

06:44.287 --> 06:47.889
I'm sure the thinking was that
since the computer is Man of the Year

06:47.890 --> 06:49.358
that that's good for our business,

06:49.359 --> 06:51.759
but like I said, I'm having
them removed from the building.

06:51.760 --> 06:55.129
What I'd like you to do with them
is to take them, all 2,600 copies,

06:55.130 --> 06:56.932
and stack them on Kottke's desk

06:56.933 --> 06:59.033
and tell him Steve says,
"Happy New Year to you."

06:59.034 --> 06:59.935
Okay.

06:59.936 --> 07:02.204
I gave <i>Time</i> magazine full access.

07:02.205 --> 07:04.906
The whole campus: Bandley, Apple II, Lisa.

07:04.907 --> 07:09.411
I gave him Sculley, Markkula. I
gave him Woz. I gave him everybody.

07:09.412 --> 07:12.781
What should I call the person who thought
it'd be a good idea to hand these out?

07:12.782 --> 07:15.016
I'm not telling you who it was.

07:15.017 --> 07:17.386
It was done without malice.
It's been taken care of.

07:17.387 --> 07:20.254
You have a half hour and we
have things to talk about.

07:20.255 --> 07:21.923
Like what?

07:21.924 --> 07:25.793
Like a million
in the first 90 days.

07:25.794 --> 07:27.194
- Joanna...
- 20,000 a month after that.

07:27.195 --> 07:28.562
- Look. Those are the forecasts.
- I'm begging...

07:28.563 --> 07:34.403
This is my field. I'm begging you
to manage expectations out there.

07:34.404 --> 07:38.939
- I'm fanning expectations.
- We're not gonna sell a million in the first 90 days.

07:38.940 --> 07:42.744
Everyone, everyone, everyone,

07:42.745 --> 07:45.312
<i>everyone</i> is waiting for the Mac.

07:45.313 --> 07:47.115
Maybe.

07:47.116 --> 07:50.018
But what happens when they
find out that for 2,495,

07:50.019 --> 07:53.120
there's nothing you can do with it?

07:53.121 --> 07:55.423
We were competitive at $1,500,

07:55.424 --> 07:59.360
but once you replaced the
Motorola 6809 with the 68000...

07:59.361 --> 08:03.098
Which is what supports menus, windows,
point and click, high-res graphics...

08:03.099 --> 08:06.334
Yeah, 'cause everyone needs
rectangles with rounded corners.

08:06.335 --> 08:10.907
Coach lands on the runway at the
exact same time as first class.

08:13.241 --> 08:16.778
I don't have the first
fucking idea what that means,

08:16.779 --> 08:18.747
but this is how it got to $2,500,

08:18.748 --> 08:22.084
which is the price point on
the PC, which can do a lot more!

08:22.085 --> 08:25.353
Who's gonna want a PC?
What idiot is gonna want...

08:25.354 --> 08:28.889
If I wanna tell you there's a spot
on your shirt, I point to the spot.

08:28.890 --> 08:32.827
I don't say there's a spot 14
centimeters down from the collar

08:32.828 --> 08:34.796
and three centimeters to the
right of the second button

08:34.797 --> 08:37.932
while I try to remember what
the command is for club soda.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.933
That's not how a person's mind works.

08:39.934 --> 08:44.740
If the goal was ease of use, maybe
you should've given it some memory.

08:44.741 --> 08:47.374
You can complain about memory
or you can complain about price,

08:47.375 --> 08:50.445
but you can't do both at the same time.

08:50.446 --> 08:52.413
Memory is what costs money.

08:52.414 --> 08:54.883
I'm glad you're telling me
your feelings about the Mac now

08:54.884 --> 08:56.518
because we have a half hour left.

08:56.519 --> 08:58.153
We can redesign it.

08:58.154 --> 09:00.889
I'm just asking you to manage expectations.

09:00.890 --> 09:02.857
Look at their faces
when they see what it is.

09:02.858 --> 09:06.193
They won't know what they're
looking at or why they like it,

09:06.194 --> 09:08.230
but they'll know they want it.

09:08.231 --> 09:10.999
Not instantly. When people
heard <i>Rite of Spring,</i>

09:11.000 --> 09:13.235
they tore the chairs out of the theater.

09:13.236 --> 09:14.436
They didn't buy the record.

09:14.437 --> 09:17.371
<i>Rite of Spring</i> happens
to be the most revolutionary

09:17.372 --> 09:19.039
and provocative symphony
of the last century.

09:19.040 --> 09:21.375
Ballet. It was a ballet.

09:21.376 --> 09:25.246
But Igor Stravinsky didn't say he
was gonna sell 20,000 units a month.

09:25.247 --> 09:27.883
I don't know why we're
talking about Stravinsky

09:27.884 --> 09:32.086
when what I care about is Dan Kottke
sodomizing me in <i>Time</i> magazine.

09:32.087 --> 09:36.390
Look. Obviously...

09:36.391 --> 09:38.360
Let me say this to you.

09:38.361 --> 09:41.462
Obviously, Daniel didn't think
he was doing anything wrong.

09:41.463 --> 09:45.033
- By talking to <i>Time</i> about it?
- Yeah.

09:45.034 --> 09:47.067
I don't know what that means.

09:47.068 --> 09:49.804
You said, when you told me the story...

09:49.805 --> 09:51.907
You said you said to Dan,

09:51.908 --> 09:54.842
"Did <i>Time</i> magazine ask you
if I had a daughter named Lisa?"

09:54.843 --> 09:56.378
And Dan said, "Yeah."

09:57.847 --> 10:01.316
My point was that he answered
you simply and honestly

10:01.317 --> 10:03.451
because he didn't think
he'd done anything wrong.

10:03.452 --> 10:08.222
Except, Joanna... Except I
don't have a daughter named Lisa.

10:08.223 --> 10:12.159
And this story is now about how I'm
denying paternity and took a blood test.

10:12.160 --> 10:15.496
And that's why there's a picture of...
I don't know what the fuck that is.

10:15.497 --> 10:17.999
That's why there's a
picture of a PC on the cover

10:18.000 --> 10:21.570
instead of a picture of me and the Mac.

10:21.571 --> 10:23.938
I don't know what to tell you.

10:23.939 --> 10:27.609
I was supposed to be <i>Time</i>
magazine's Man of the Year.

10:27.610 --> 10:30.279
And then Dan Kottke was born.

10:35.116 --> 10:37.085
- Well...
- What?

10:37.086 --> 10:41.188
- She's waiting for you.
- Who?

10:41.189 --> 10:43.158
- Chrisann.
- Brennan?

10:43.159 --> 10:44.625
They're out in the hall.

10:44.626 --> 10:48.129
They've been sitting in the back of
the auditorium since 7:00 this morning.

10:48.130 --> 10:51.566
I'm not having a session
with Chrisann right now.

10:51.567 --> 10:55.269
We issued 335 press
credentials for the launch.

10:55.270 --> 10:58.273
Steve, you piss off Chrisann,

10:58.274 --> 11:01.543
she's gonna stand in the
lobby and give 335 interviews,

11:01.544 --> 11:06.783
and you, pal, will be longing for
the halcyon days of Dan Kottke.

11:08.150 --> 11:11.219
Let me get this over with.

11:11.220 --> 11:13.520
But don't leave. You're gonna stay here.

11:13.521 --> 11:14.956
What? No. I'm not.

11:14.957 --> 11:18.426
No. There's less of a chance of a
scene if you stay here. She'll be cool.

11:18.427 --> 11:23.298
I find all this
excruciatingly personal and-and...

11:23.299 --> 11:25.933
I-I'm... I'm not staying.

11:25.934 --> 11:27.434
No. Come on.

11:27.435 --> 11:30.639
I don't wanna be in a
room alone with Chrisann.

11:33.509 --> 11:35.945
This is me and you.

11:39.448 --> 11:40.917
Fine.

11:48.624 --> 11:50.093
Hey.

11:53.629 --> 11:55.931
Steve.

11:55.932 --> 11:57.298
This is a surprise.

11:57.299 --> 11:59.600
Why don't you come on in?

11:59.601 --> 12:01.837
Thank you.

12:04.073 --> 12:06.474
- You coming too?
- Yes, I'm not gonna leave her in the hallway.

12:06.475 --> 12:08.943
Okay. It's a safe hallway, but anyway.

12:08.944 --> 12:11.712
You remember Joanna Hoffman? She's
the head of marketing for the Mac.

12:11.713 --> 12:14.182
Good to see you.

12:14.183 --> 12:16.650
Nice to see you. Hello, Lisa.

12:16.651 --> 12:19.653
We've met before, and you told
me you like the way I talk,

12:19.654 --> 12:23.357
and that was my favorite
thing anyone's ever said to me.

12:23.358 --> 12:25.360
- You're from Poland.
- Yes, I am.

12:25.361 --> 12:28.129
- Do you know where that is?
- The top of the Earth.

12:28.130 --> 12:30.097
I think you're thinking of the North Pole.

12:30.098 --> 12:31.999
Well, we're a little
pressed for time, so...

12:32.000 --> 12:34.402
- I'll leave you guys alone.
- Why do you wanna leave when you just said...

12:34.403 --> 12:36.839
I'm gonna check in with Hertzfeld.

12:44.145 --> 12:46.548
We're trying to get a
computer to say hello,

12:46.549 --> 12:49.116
but right now it's being very shy.

12:49.117 --> 12:51.052
Would you come help me? Is that okay?

12:51.053 --> 12:52.653
Sure.

12:52.654 --> 12:55.123
Thank you.

12:55.124 --> 12:57.057
My dad named a computer after me.

12:57.058 --> 13:00.495
I'm not your...

13:00.496 --> 13:03.731
Actually, do you know what
a coincidence is, Lisa?

13:03.732 --> 13:06.169
No.

13:07.370 --> 13:10.404
Like if you met someone.

13:10.405 --> 13:12.706
You made a new friend
and her name was Lisa too.

13:12.707 --> 13:14.576
That would be a coincidence.

13:14.577 --> 13:17.578
"Lisa" stands for "Local
Integrated Systems Architecture."

13:17.579 --> 13:20.215
L-I-S-A.

13:21.683 --> 13:23.785
It's a coincidence.

13:25.487 --> 13:27.654
- You about done?
- Yeah.

13:27.655 --> 13:28.489
Okay.

13:28.490 --> 13:33.930
Come. Let's make that computer say hi.

13:35.197 --> 13:37.097
Go ahead, Lisa.

13:37.098 --> 13:40.268
So it was the other way around.

13:40.269 --> 13:42.537
I was named after the computer?

13:42.538 --> 13:45.807
Nothing was named after
anybody. It's a coincidence.

13:45.808 --> 13:48.144
Come on.

13:53.049 --> 13:54.383
What's the matter with you?

13:54.384 --> 13:56.583
What's the matter with you? Why
are you telling her these things?

13:56.584 --> 13:58.552
Why are you still telling
her I'm her father?

13:58.553 --> 14:00.455
- A judge told her you're her father.
- No, he didn't.

14:00.456 --> 14:02.322
Where the hell do you get off
telling <i>Time</i> magazine

14:02.323 --> 14:04.325
I've slept with 28 percent
of the men in America?

14:04.326 --> 14:06.293
- That's not...
- Where do you get off?

14:06.294 --> 14:09.130
That's not remotely what I said.

14:11.467 --> 14:14.168
It's right here.

14:14.169 --> 14:16.137
First of all, can I tell you
something about <i>Time</i> magazine?

14:16.138 --> 14:18.840
I believe it's a training
facility for paid assassins.

14:18.841 --> 14:22.342
- "Jobs insists"... I am quoting...
- I didn't invent math.

14:22.343 --> 14:25.480
"...twenty-eight percent of
the male population of the United States

14:25.481 --> 14:27.615
could be the father."

14:27.616 --> 14:31.619
I wasn't saying you've slept
with 28% of American men.

14:31.620 --> 14:34.522
I was using an algorithm
based on the blood test

14:34.523 --> 14:38.659
which said there was a 94.1%
chance that I'm the father.

14:38.660 --> 14:41.863
You're trying to publicly
paint me as a slut and a whore.

14:41.864 --> 14:44.365
Believe me, I'm not trying to
publicly do anything with you.

14:44.366 --> 14:46.067
Two million people read
<i>Time.</i> How am I supposed...

14:46.068 --> 14:49.703
It would be more if they put me on the cover,
but Dan Kottke decided to kidney-punch me...

14:49.704 --> 14:52.874
- I applied for welfare yesterday.
- I'm sorry?

14:52.875 --> 14:55.878
- Hello!
- I said I applied for welfare yesterday.

14:57.178 --> 15:01.615
The <i>Time</i> article said your
Apple stock was worth $441 million,

15:01.616 --> 15:03.750
and I wanted to ask you
how you felt about that.

15:03.751 --> 15:06.587
Well, I feel like Apple stock
has been dramatically undervalued.

15:06.588 --> 15:08.523
This would be a good time to get in.

15:08.524 --> 15:11.259
Your daughter and her mother...

15:11.260 --> 15:13.461
- Chrisann...
- are on welfare.

15:13.462 --> 15:16.197
We're living in a hovel in Menlo Park.

15:16.198 --> 15:17.698
We can't pay the heating bills.

15:17.699 --> 15:20.235
She sleeps in a parka.

15:20.236 --> 15:22.537
- Your daughter...
- She's not my daughter!

15:22.538 --> 15:25.572
Because, as reported
by <i>Time</i> magazine,

15:25.573 --> 15:28.543
- I've slept with 28% of the men in America?
- No.

15:28.544 --> 15:32.148
All of them, exactly nine
months before Lisa was born.

15:37.419 --> 15:39.287
I've got Andy here.

15:45.861 --> 15:48.331
Excuse me.

15:57.405 --> 15:58.572
We're there?

15:58.573 --> 16:00.575
- Hey, Chris.
- Hey, Andy.

16:00.576 --> 16:02.342
- How are you doin'?
- Terrible.

16:02.343 --> 16:03.677
You guys caught up now?

16:03.678 --> 16:06.313
Excuse me for saying hello to my
friend, who thinks you're a dick.

16:06.314 --> 16:07.715
- I don't think you're a...
- We're there?

16:07.716 --> 16:10.751
- No. It's got a one-in-six chance of working.
- Goddamn it.

16:10.752 --> 16:15.590
Well, we're not a pit crew at Daytona.
This can't be fixed in seconds.

16:15.591 --> 16:18.458
You didn't have seconds.
You had three weeks.

16:18.459 --> 16:21.528
The universe was created
in a third of that time.

16:21.529 --> 16:23.798
Well, someday you'll have
to tell us how you did it.

16:27.303 --> 16:29.736
Here's what I'm gonna do.

16:29.737 --> 16:33.874
I'm gonna announce the names of
everyone who designed the launch demo.

16:33.875 --> 16:36.677
I'm gonna introduce everyone
and ask them to stand up.

16:36.678 --> 16:38.980
The bag was designed by Susan Kare.

16:38.981 --> 16:42.884
The Macintosh font that's scrolling across
the screen was designed by Steve Capps.

16:42.885 --> 16:46.221
The starry night and
skywriting was Bruce Horn.

16:46.222 --> 16:51.859
MacPaint, MacWrite, Alice,
down to the calculator.

16:51.860 --> 16:54.762
And then I'm gonna say the
voice demo that didn't work

16:54.763 --> 16:57.667
was designed by Andy Hertzfeld.

17:03.772 --> 17:05.238
Steve...

17:05.239 --> 17:08.508
Five-in-six is your chance of surviving
the first round of Russian roulette,

17:08.509 --> 17:10.377
and you've reversed those odds.

17:10.378 --> 17:12.579
So unless you wanna be disgraced
in front of your friends,

17:12.580 --> 17:15.782
family, colleagues,
stockholders and the press,

17:15.784 --> 17:17.551
I wouldn't stand here arguing.

17:17.553 --> 17:20.921
I'd go try and get some
more bullets out of the gun.

17:20.922 --> 17:23.258
Do it, Andy!

17:27.729 --> 17:29.397
Stop. You.

17:29.398 --> 17:31.299
- What size shirt do you wear?
- Me?

17:31.300 --> 17:33.801
Does anyone know what size shirt
he wears? What size shirt I wear?

17:33.802 --> 17:36.036
Does anyone know where
the closest psychiatrist is?

17:36.037 --> 17:38.906
The disk fits in your pocket.

17:38.907 --> 17:41.542
I need a shirt with a breast
pocket. I can take it out onstage.

17:41.543 --> 17:43.043
- A shirt?
- The disk!

17:43.044 --> 17:46.046
I need a white shirt in my
size with a breast pocket.

17:46.047 --> 17:49.350
Yes. Which one of the no
stores that are open at 8:45

17:49.351 --> 17:52.853
do you want me to have someone run
to and return from in 15 minutes?

17:52.854 --> 17:56.724
Go out in the lobby, find someone
my size who's wearing a white shirt.

17:56.725 --> 17:59.026
Tell them I'll trade
them for a free computer,

17:59.027 --> 18:00.794
and they get to keep my shirt.

18:00.795 --> 18:03.063
Does it have to be a
white shirt? Is blue okay?

18:03.064 --> 18:07.802
No. The Mac is beige, I'm beige, the
disk is blue, the shirt has to be white.

18:07.803 --> 18:09.237
Andy?

18:30.025 --> 18:33.828
Hello, I'm Macintosh.

18:33.829 --> 18:37.732
Bring me the head of Andy Hertzfeld.

18:37.733 --> 18:39.966
I tried to get it to
say hello, but it's shy.

18:39.967 --> 18:42.035
Yeah.

18:42.036 --> 18:43.603
So that's it?

18:43.604 --> 18:46.207
That's it.

18:47.609 --> 18:49.110
I don't get it.

18:49.111 --> 18:50.745
I know.

18:50.746 --> 18:52.612
What are people going to do with it?

18:52.613 --> 18:54.349
Lisa, how old are you now?

18:54.350 --> 18:56.484
- You know how old she is.
- How old are you, Lisa?

18:56.485 --> 18:58.254
Five.

18:59.420 --> 19:01.524
Come sit here for a minute.

19:05.494 --> 19:07.527
Do you know what this is?

19:07.528 --> 19:10.630
- It's a computer.
- It's a computer.

19:10.631 --> 19:13.134
Can I borrow your hand for a second?

19:14.402 --> 19:17.139
Point that arrow and click.

19:18.940 --> 19:21.676
You don't have to, but if you
want, you can play with it.

19:21.677 --> 19:24.911
Nothing you can do will break it,
so just do whatever you want with it.

19:24.912 --> 19:26.112
What are you doing?

19:26.113 --> 19:29.883
I'm paying you exactly what
the court ordered me to pay you.

19:29.884 --> 19:32.786
$385 a month.

19:32.787 --> 19:34.755
I'm not the one who decided on that amount.

19:34.756 --> 19:36.657
And I'm asking you how you feel.

19:36.658 --> 19:38.158
If you feel all right.

19:38.159 --> 19:41.661
- If it feels all right to you that your daughter...
- She's not my...

19:41.662 --> 19:44.399
That your daughter and
her mother are on welfare

19:44.400 --> 19:48.402
while you're worth $441
million for making that.

19:48.403 --> 19:51.539
I'm proud to say Apple donates
computers to underfunded schools,

19:51.540 --> 19:54.041
- and we'll be doing more of the same with the Mac...
- What?

19:54.042 --> 19:57.844
Apple donates millions of dollars'
worth of computers to schools.

19:57.845 --> 19:59.880
What does that have to do with...

19:59.881 --> 20:04.752
Imagine an underprivileged kid that has
their favorite teacher with them 24 hours.

20:04.753 --> 20:06.687
We're minutes away from
being able to do that.

20:06.688 --> 20:09.424
In your head, was that
an answer to my question?

20:09.425 --> 20:10.957
Tell me the question again.

20:11.959 --> 20:14.128
I wasn't the one who sued
you for child support.

20:14.129 --> 20:16.697
- No, let...
- San Mateo County sued you.

20:16.698 --> 20:19.699
No, let me explain what happened,
'cause I have plenty of time right now.

20:21.437 --> 20:23.070
Excuse me. You have a visitor.

20:23.071 --> 20:25.639
Just wanted to say good
luck. Hey, Chrisann.

20:25.640 --> 20:28.444
- Hello, Woz.
- Hang on.

20:31.979 --> 20:34.482
- Just wanted to say good luck.
- Thanks. You too.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.882
- It's a big morning.
- Yeah.

20:35.883 --> 20:37.784
You should see this crowd out there.

20:37.785 --> 20:40.421
This crowd, it's like, um...

20:41.457 --> 20:44.524
I can't really wait for you to
come up with a metaphor, man.

20:44.525 --> 20:47.462
- Yeah. So, listen, I want to ask you a favor.
- Yeah?

20:47.463 --> 20:50.231
- Can you acknowledge the Apple II team in your remarks?
- I cannot.

20:50.232 --> 20:51.799
Just an acknowledgement.

20:51.800 --> 20:54.768
Have them stand up.

20:54.769 --> 20:56.870
- We're launching the Mac.
- It'd be a morale booster.

20:56.871 --> 20:59.040
Just a mention so they could
get a round of applause.

20:59.041 --> 21:01.242
- Just a mention.
- Can we stick a pin in this for a minute?

21:01.243 --> 21:02.776
- Sure.
- Thank you.

21:02.777 --> 21:05.012
Just talking about an
acknowledgement for the team.

21:05.013 --> 21:07.180
I've got Chrisann in there.
I'll see you in a second.

21:07.181 --> 21:09.649
Yep.

21:16.024 --> 21:17.024
That.

21:17.025 --> 21:18.391
What?

21:18.392 --> 21:21.928
You asked me what people are gonna
do with it. They're gonna do that.

21:23.899 --> 21:25.966
One of the engineers.

21:25.967 --> 21:27.937
Thank you.

21:35.043 --> 21:37.146
Do you like it?

21:40.082 --> 21:41.181
I'm sorry?

21:41.182 --> 21:43.950
It's an abstract.

21:43.951 --> 21:48.289
You used MacPaint.

21:51.759 --> 21:54.529
Push that key and the "S" at the same time.

21:57.198 --> 21:59.000
Now type your name.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.580
Do you know which box says "Save"?

22:13.047 --> 22:16.217
Right. Go ahead and click on it.

22:23.958 --> 22:25.626
I'll put some money in your account

22:25.627 --> 22:28.763
and buy you a new house,
someplace near a decent school.

22:28.764 --> 22:31.732
Thank you.

22:31.733 --> 22:34.735
Woz wants a minute.

22:34.736 --> 22:37.204
And Sculley's asking for you.

22:37.205 --> 22:40.107
We're done?

22:41.043 --> 22:44.277
Could you teach me more things?

22:44.278 --> 22:46.613
On the computer?

22:46.614 --> 22:48.583
Lisa, wait for me in the hall, please.

22:51.887 --> 22:54.187
You can put your coat on in the hall.

22:54.188 --> 22:55.623
Bye, Lisa.

22:56.691 --> 22:59.327
- Bye.
- Lisa, in the hall. Now.

22:59.328 --> 23:01.762
I wanna know, when you say you're
gonna put money in my account,

23:01.763 --> 23:03.164
how much we're talking about.

23:03.165 --> 23:05.768
It's a school day. She
needs to be in school.

23:07.636 --> 23:10.239
I'm gonna give you whatever you need.

23:26.888 --> 23:31.024
Woz wants me to acknowledge
the Apple II team.

23:31.025 --> 23:33.260
You must be able to see
that she looks like you.

23:33.261 --> 23:35.830
I don't want to insult Woz. I
just think it's backward-looking

23:35.831 --> 23:37.665
at exactly the wrong moment.

23:37.666 --> 23:40.700
- I know you heard what I said.
- I heard what you said, Joanna.

23:40.701 --> 23:43.904
It's just we're about to do this thing.

23:43.905 --> 23:49.043
At 9:41, the planet's gonna shift
on its axis nigh and forever.

23:49.044 --> 23:51.779
Two most significant
events of the 20th century:

23:51.780 --> 23:54.649
the Allies win the war and this.

23:54.650 --> 23:56.016
This.

23:56.017 --> 23:58.319
So maybe right now isn't the
very best time to scold me

23:58.320 --> 24:01.222
for not being a better father
to a kid who's not my kid.

24:01.223 --> 24:04.324
- The test said I...
- I don't care what the test said.

24:04.325 --> 24:05.592
I don't care about 94.1%

24:05.593 --> 24:08.329
or the insane algorithm you used
to get to 28% of American men.

24:08.330 --> 24:10.430
Buying her a new house.
I'm giving her money.

24:10.431 --> 24:13.167
There's a small girl who
believes you're her father.

24:13.168 --> 24:17.671
That's all. That's all the math there is.

24:17.672 --> 24:21.207
She believes it. What are
you gonna do about that?

24:21.208 --> 24:23.977
God sent his only son on a suicide mission,

24:23.978 --> 24:27.682
but we like him anyway
because he made trees.

24:29.051 --> 24:31.918
We're gonna sell a million
units in the first 90 days.

24:31.919 --> 24:33.987
20,000 a month after that.

24:33.988 --> 24:36.792
So maybe you could give
me a break, Ms. Hoffman?

25:28.376 --> 25:30.377
- Woz.
- Hey.

25:30.378 --> 25:33.013
There's nothing in that vending
machine that won't kill you.

25:33.014 --> 25:35.248
- Just browsing.
- Let's take a walk.

25:35.249 --> 25:37.350
- Can I tell you something?
- Yeah.

25:37.351 --> 25:40.754
After the meeting in Maui, the Apple
II team was upset and angry and down.

25:40.755 --> 25:43.157
- Do you know why?
- Because the Apple II wasn't mentioned even once?

25:43.158 --> 25:45.793
The Apple II wasn't mentioned ev...

25:45.794 --> 25:47.427
Yes, that's it. You have it. Yes.

25:47.428 --> 25:50.531
- That wasn't an oversight.
- They know that. They know it wasn't.

25:50.532 --> 25:52.766
I don't wanna make a
big deal out of this...

25:52.767 --> 25:54.334
That's entirely within your power.

25:54.335 --> 25:57.103
- The Apple II is...
- The Apple II is what was, my friend.

25:57.104 --> 26:00.808
The Apple II is what pays the bills
around here and has for seven years.

26:00.809 --> 26:02.075
And if you embarrass these people,

26:02.076 --> 26:05.044
you are going to see a brain
drain at this company, my brother.

26:05.045 --> 26:07.814
Markkula took you off the Lisa, not
them and not me, so don't blame...

26:07.815 --> 26:12.319
Markkula took me off the Lisa because of his
strong religious objection to making it good.

26:12.320 --> 26:15.188
Now I gave you everything
you wanted on the Apple II.

26:15.189 --> 26:16.924
You don't ask for a lot?

26:16.925 --> 26:19.392
There wasn't a single fight you lost.

26:19.393 --> 26:21.962
Do you concede the slots are the
reason for the success of the Apple II?

26:21.963 --> 26:24.098
- We can't still be talking about the slots.
- I have a point.

26:24.099 --> 26:27.066
It's been seven years. You're still
doing it. You're talking about the slots.

26:27.067 --> 26:30.004
There's something wrong with you.
This argument started in the garage.

26:30.005 --> 26:34.809
What are you talking about? Why
would you only want two slots?

26:34.810 --> 26:36.811
A printer and a modem.

26:36.812 --> 26:38.344
With eight slots, you...

26:38.345 --> 26:41.415
This is a huge deal that we
were able to add eight slots.

26:41.416 --> 26:44.318
I appreciate the engineering,
but it's not what we're doing.

26:44.319 --> 26:46.020
- And thank God I won that argument...
- Woz.

26:46.021 --> 26:48.822
Because the open system is what
people love about the machine,

26:48.823 --> 26:50.323
and it's why it sold and still sells.

26:50.324 --> 26:52.993
An open system. We're
not doing an open system.

26:52.994 --> 26:56.964
Of course we are. That's what people want,
and the breakthrough on the Apple II...

26:56.965 --> 26:59.833
People don't know what they
want until you show it to them.

26:59.834 --> 27:04.504
Serious users want to customize. They
wanna modify. They wanna jack it up.

27:04.505 --> 27:08.042
They want hardware engineers like
me to expand its capabilities, okay?

27:08.043 --> 27:09.976
Keyboards for music, better sound board,

27:09.977 --> 27:11.879
better display boards,
improved memory cards.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.215
And it's why there are
3,000 people here right now.

27:14.216 --> 27:18.252
The slots are what allowed the Apple II
to run, for just one example, VisiCalc,

27:18.253 --> 27:22.356
which from my guess single-handedly sold
between 200,000 and 300,000 machines.

27:22.357 --> 27:25.325
- They want slots.
- They don't get a vote.

27:25.326 --> 27:28.862
When Dylan wrote "Shelter from the Storm," he
didn't ask people to contribute to the lyrics.

27:28.863 --> 27:30.864
Plays don't stop so the
playwright can ask the audience

27:30.865 --> 27:32.233
what scene they'd like to see next.

27:32.234 --> 27:33.200
- Painters...
- Hobbyists...

27:33.201 --> 27:36.870
We're on the verge of
a tectonic... Hobbyists?

27:36.871 --> 27:38.806
A printer and a modem. Two slots.

27:40.108 --> 27:42.008
The Apple II team has my affection,

27:42.009 --> 27:45.478
but I'm not loving up a seven-year-old
product at the Mac launch.

27:45.479 --> 27:48.882
- Computers aren't paintings.
- Fuck you.

27:48.883 --> 27:52.285
I'm gonna say "fuck you" every time you
say that until you either die or stop.

27:52.286 --> 27:53.987
- Steve...
- Try it.

27:53.988 --> 27:55.121
- Steve.
- Say it.

27:55.122 --> 27:57.925
- Computers aren't paintings.
- Fuck you.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.995
Yes, they are, and what
I want is a closed system.

28:00.996 --> 28:05.100
End-to-end control. Completely
incompatible with anything.

28:09.137 --> 28:11.572
Computers aren't supposed
to have human flaws.

28:11.573 --> 28:15.009
I'm not going to build this one with yours.

28:26.454 --> 28:27.553
Steve!

28:27.554 --> 28:28.589
Hey.

28:28.590 --> 28:32.225
Today is about the Macintosh.
And the Mac is mine.

28:32.226 --> 28:33.994
- I give you that.
- Thank you.

28:33.995 --> 28:36.397
I give you that. Just publicly
acknowledge the Apple II team

28:36.398 --> 28:37.831
'cause it's the right thing to do.

28:37.832 --> 28:41.467
We'll know soon enough if you are
Leonardo da Vinci or just think you are,

28:41.468 --> 28:43.236
but in the meantime, it would be great...

28:43.237 --> 28:46.139
In the meantime, the Apple II is done.

28:46.140 --> 28:48.207
Seven years. It was a great run.

28:48.208 --> 28:50.746
You should go out in the
house and take your seat.

28:52.647 --> 28:55.448
The Mac is Jef Raskin's.

28:55.449 --> 28:57.051
Say it for me.

28:57.052 --> 28:58.518
- Computers aren't...
- Fuck you.

28:58.519 --> 29:00.486
All right.

29:05.126 --> 29:07.062
Five, six...

29:08.362 --> 29:10.097
- We're there?
- I need more time.

29:10.098 --> 29:12.131
- You can't have it.
- 20 minutes.

29:12.132 --> 29:14.435
- It's 8:58.
- We can start late.

29:14.436 --> 29:17.236
Hear me. We're a computer
company. We can't start late.

29:17.237 --> 29:19.305
- Then I have another idea.
- What?

29:19.306 --> 29:22.008
It's deceptive and borderline unethical.

29:22.009 --> 29:24.078
- I'm listening.
- It'll run on the 512.

29:24.079 --> 29:26.045
- You tested it?
- Yeah.

29:26.046 --> 29:30.383
- Wait. You're gonna demo a 128 computer on a 512?
- Nobody's gonna know.

29:30.384 --> 29:33.087
And you think that's
<i>borderline</i> unethical?

29:33.088 --> 29:35.989
Name my other choices, please.

29:35.990 --> 29:39.693
Please. You have to tell me why it's
so important for it to say hello.

29:39.694 --> 29:43.764
Hollywood. They made
computers scary things.

29:43.765 --> 29:47.400
See how this reminds you of a friendly
face, that the disk slot is a goofy grin?

29:47.401 --> 29:52.072
It's warm and it's playful
and it needs to say hello.

29:52.073 --> 29:54.408
It needs to say hello because it can.

30:02.550 --> 30:04.517
We're not committing fraud.

30:04.518 --> 30:07.620
The 512 is gonna ship in under a year.

30:07.621 --> 30:10.792
Will you absolve me of your
Eastern European disapproval?

30:12.393 --> 30:16.629
The computer in <i>2001</i> said hello all the time
and it still scared the shit out of me.

30:16.630 --> 30:18.967
Absolve me.

30:20.067 --> 30:22.602
Just for this.

30:22.603 --> 30:25.104
And just for now.

30:25.105 --> 30:31.078
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
founding board member Mike Markkula.

30:36.650 --> 30:40.654
All right. Okay.

30:40.655 --> 30:43.256
Go make a dent in the universe, Steven.

30:43.257 --> 30:45.559
See you in a couple hours.

30:45.560 --> 30:48.262
And I'm going to take us through
the formal part of the meeting,

30:48.263 --> 30:49.696
the legal part, if you will.

30:49.697 --> 30:53.332
Thank merciful God.
The cavalry's shown up.

30:53.333 --> 30:56.469
I hear you've been worse than usual this
morning. I didn't think that was possible.

30:56.470 --> 31:00.206
So I've been dispatched
as the "Steve Whisperer."

31:00.207 --> 31:02.609
This is a '55 Margaux.

31:02.610 --> 31:06.245
- It's 9:00 in the morning.
- This is a '55 Margaux.

31:08.615 --> 31:12.820
Is it my imagination or have
you started to dress like me?

31:12.821 --> 31:15.722
It was a bad idea to have Markkula
open with quarterly reports.

31:15.723 --> 31:17.858
Instead we should have just
dropped water on the audience.

31:17.859 --> 31:21.495
You know, just big 10,000-gallon tanks
of cold water, dropped from the ceiling.

31:21.496 --> 31:23.362
Save Mike some money on index cards.

31:23.363 --> 31:25.832
- Oh, just relax.
- Why?

31:25.833 --> 31:28.802
I don't know. No one's
ever asked me that question.

31:28.803 --> 31:31.206
There you go.

31:36.643 --> 31:39.379
You're the only one who sees
the world the same way I do.

31:39.380 --> 31:42.217
No one sees the world the same way you do.

31:43.450 --> 31:45.319
I'm like Julius Caesar, John.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.888
- I'm surrounded by enemies.
- No, you're not.

31:47.889 --> 31:51.190
- The board...
- Oh, the board. The board's behind you.

31:51.191 --> 31:52.825
Only because you see to it they are.

31:52.826 --> 31:54.227
I think it's a good board,

31:54.228 --> 31:57.397
but if you want me to push them out
one by one, we can talk about that.

31:57.398 --> 31:59.299
I want you to push them out all at once...

31:59.300 --> 32:01.834
through a window, if it's the nearest exit.

32:01.835 --> 32:04.138
The look on their faces
when we showed them the spot.

32:04.139 --> 32:06.873
I couldn't see their faces, 'cause they
were banging their heads on the table.

32:06.874 --> 32:10.811
Yeah, yeah. Yesterday, the
day after it airs <i>once,</i>

32:10.812 --> 32:13.514
the publisher of <i>Adweek</i> calls
it the best commercial of all time.

32:13.515 --> 32:17.148
Of all time! And it is.

32:17.149 --> 32:19.785
And if anyone does one better, it's gonna be
Chiat/Day, who the board wanted to replace,

32:19.786 --> 32:22.555
and it's gonna be Lee Clow, who the
board thought was out of his mind.

32:22.556 --> 32:25.359
<i>Ladies
and gentlemen, "1984."</i>

32:25.360 --> 32:27.727
<i>The first glorious anniversary</i>

32:27.728 --> 32:30.330
<i>of the information
purification directives.</i>

32:30.331 --> 32:34.600
<i>We have created for the
first time in all history</i>

32:34.601 --> 32:37.638
<i>a garden of pure ideology</i>

32:37.639 --> 32:40.239
<i>where each worker may bloom,</i>

32:40.240 --> 32:44.710
<i>secure from the pests purveying
contradictory thoughts.</i>

32:44.711 --> 32:50.883
<i>Our unification of thoughts is more powerful
a weapon than any fleet or army on earth.</i>

32:50.884 --> 32:52.485
<i>We are one people...</i>

32:52.486 --> 32:54.220
Did we use skinheads as extras?

32:54.221 --> 32:56.689
- A couple of people have told me that.
- Yeah.

32:56.690 --> 32:58.859
We paid skinheads? I've
got skinheads on my payroll?

32:58.860 --> 33:01.527
- They had a look you wanted.
- The skinheads?

33:01.528 --> 33:04.731
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's keep that to ourselves.

33:05.800 --> 33:09.169
<i>We shall prevail.</i>

33:12.273 --> 33:16.944
<i>On January 24th, Apple
Computer will introduce Macintosh.</i>

33:16.945 --> 33:19.379
- Who else knows?
- Who else knows what?

33:19.380 --> 33:22.482
- That we paid terrorists to be in our TV commercial.
- John...

33:22.483 --> 33:25.319
They were wrong about the ad, but
they're a good board. Good people.

33:25.320 --> 33:27.853
Their only problem... Their
problem is that they're people.

33:27.854 --> 33:32.225
People. The very nature of people
is something to be overcome.

33:32.226 --> 33:37.231
When I was running Pepsi, we had a lot
of success focusing on 18-to-55-year-olds

33:37.232 --> 33:39.632
- who weren't members of violent hate groups.
- I get it.

33:39.633 --> 33:41.368
You're not surrounded by enemies.

33:41.369 --> 33:43.536
We're almost there.

33:43.537 --> 33:46.372
I'm back and forth on the Dylan.

33:46.373 --> 33:47.707
I might quote a different verse.

33:47.708 --> 33:48.941
What are the choices?

33:48.942 --> 33:51.511
"For the loser now will be later to win,"

33:51.512 --> 33:53.714
- which is what we have.
- Mm-hmm. Or?

33:53.715 --> 33:56.550
"Come mothers and fathers
throughout the land

33:56.551 --> 33:58.485
and don't criticize what
you can't understand.

33:58.486 --> 33:59.986
Your sons and your daughters"...

33:59.987 --> 34:01.588
"Are beyond your command."

34:01.589 --> 34:03.389
I just lost a hundred
bucks to Andy Hertzfeld.

34:03.390 --> 34:06.260
He said you'd change it to that verse.

34:06.261 --> 34:10.165
We got 45 seconds. I want to
use it to ask you a question.

34:11.431 --> 34:15.902
Why do people who are adopted feel like
they were rejected instead of selected?

34:15.902 --> 34:17.069
That came out of nowhere.

34:17.070 --> 34:19.538
"Your sons and your daughters
are beyond your command.

34:19.539 --> 34:21.641
Your old road is rapidly aging."

34:21.641 --> 34:24.344
So go fuck yourself, because
my name is Steve Jobs,

34:24.344 --> 34:26.347
and the times, they are a-changin'.

34:27.447 --> 34:29.016
I don't feel rejected.

34:29.016 --> 34:31.018
- You're sure?
- Very sure.

34:31.018 --> 34:33.687
'Cause it's not like the baby is
born and the parents look and say,

34:33.688 --> 34:36.556
"Nah, we're not interested in this one."

34:36.556 --> 34:38.458
On the other hand, someone did choose you.

34:43.030 --> 34:45.132
It's having no control.

34:46.967 --> 34:48.969
You find out you were out of the loop

34:48.969 --> 34:52.407
when the most crucial events
in your life were set in motion.

34:54.842 --> 34:57.412
As long as you have control.

34:58.713 --> 35:01.216
I don't understand people who give it up.

35:02.684 --> 35:06.018
What inspired Hertzfeld to make that bet?

35:06.019 --> 35:10.324
He was warning me that being your
father figure could be dangerous.

35:10.325 --> 35:13.726
Keep your 100 bucks. I'm
sticking with the first verse.

35:13.727 --> 35:14.560
Good.

35:14.561 --> 35:16.996
- What the hell does he mean?
- Nothing.

35:16.997 --> 35:20.000
I'm proud of you.

35:20.001 --> 35:23.402
Thank you, boss.

35:23.403 --> 35:27.341
It's my pleasure to introduce
my friend and the CEO of Apple,

35:27.342 --> 35:29.076
John Sculley.

35:29.077 --> 35:30.743
John?

35:30.744 --> 35:32.112
Yeah?

35:32.113 --> 35:35.150
Lisa made a painting on the Mac.

35:38.753 --> 35:42.054
<i>The Macintosh,
Apple's near mythological home computer,</i>

35:42.055 --> 35:45.659
<i>has gotten off to a rocky start in
its battle with industry titan IBM.</i>

35:45.660 --> 35:48.895
<i>With sales originally projected to
be a million in the first quarter,</i>

35:48.896 --> 35:51.130
<i>Apple has sold only 35,000
of the user-friendly machines</i>

35:51.131 --> 35:53.567
<i>in the months since it's
been available to customers.</i>

35:53.568 --> 35:55.000
<i>The insistence by Steve Jobs</i>

35:55.001 --> 35:56.735
<i>that it have what's
called end-to-end control,</i>

35:56.736 --> 36:01.375
<i>which is a way of saying that it's not compatible
with most outside hardware or software,</i>

36:01.376 --> 36:04.578
<i>is the Shakespearean flaw in a
machine that</i> had <i>potential.</i>

36:04.579 --> 36:07.480
<i>Apple Computers
closed two of its factories today</i>

36:07.481 --> 36:08.915
<i>in the wake of disappointing sales.</i>

36:08.916 --> 36:12.152
<i>Do you know how
many Macs were sold last month? 500.</i>

36:12.153 --> 36:15.054
<i>In a move that
surprised some but not all on Wall Street,</i>

36:15.055 --> 36:17.656
<i>the board of directors of
Apple Computers voted today</i>

36:17.657 --> 36:20.060
<i>to fire its cofounder Steve Jobs.</i>

36:20.061 --> 36:22.094
<i>Did he jump or
was he pushed?</i>

36:22.095 --> 36:25.931
<i>His ex-boss, Apple CEO John
Sculley, refused to comment.</i>

36:25.932 --> 36:27.933
<i>However,
in an exclusive interview,</i>

36:27.934 --> 36:32.038
<i>Steve Wozniak has slammed the
integrity of his old friend Steve Jobs.</i>

36:32.039 --> 36:35.141
<i>He calls Jobs an
insulting and hurtful guy.</i>

36:35.142 --> 36:38.677
<i>Jobs is hitting back
with a new company and a new computer.</i>

36:38.678 --> 36:40.781
<i>Apple has a new competitor.</i>

36:40.782 --> 36:43.482
<i>Steve Jobs's black cube is
aimed at the education market.</i>

36:43.483 --> 36:45.951
<i>Few people have
the ability to make the world wait,</i>

36:45.952 --> 36:50.425
<i>but that is just what Jobs is
doing with his new company, NeXT.</i>

36:58.698 --> 37:00.600
<i>Focus seems kind of sharp.</i>

37:00.601 --> 37:02.134
<i>On the slide?</i>

37:02.135 --> 37:03.904
The floor. The pin spot.

37:03.905 --> 37:05.938
I think we want a sharp focus.

37:05.939 --> 37:09.442
Don't take it personally. Just
not a fan of the circus aesthetic.

37:09.443 --> 37:13.446
All right, let's hold here. We're gonna
have to go up and refocus the instruments.

37:13.447 --> 37:15.882
Just one. The 30 is fine.

37:15.883 --> 37:19.118
While we're holding, there are
well-wishers in the VIP room.

37:19.119 --> 37:20.821
And Woz is here.

37:20.822 --> 37:23.656
Steve Wozniak. Yes.
Thank you very much.

37:23.657 --> 37:25.192
<i>And Andy Hertzfeld.</i>

37:25.193 --> 37:27.594
Andy Hertzfeld. Thank you.

37:27.595 --> 37:30.496
<i>John Sculley is here too.</i>

37:30.497 --> 37:32.466
It's nice that he's here.

37:32.467 --> 37:34.801
Really? I don't
think it's very nice at all.

37:34.802 --> 37:37.136
You have to see them.
They wanna pay their respects.

37:37.137 --> 37:39.772
If they were respectful, we'd
all still be at Apple right now.

37:39.773 --> 37:41.475
Look...

37:41.476 --> 37:43.576
If they really wished me well,
they'd keep to themselves.

37:43.577 --> 37:46.112
- Can I tell you something?
- I don't think they do wish me well.

37:46.113 --> 37:48.581
<i>But I'm all right with
that. I'm over Apple.</i>

37:48.582 --> 37:50.817
I got over the Mac and Woz and Sculley,

37:50.818 --> 37:52.752
the same way you get over
your high school sweetheart.

37:52.753 --> 37:54.554
Build a new one.

37:54.555 --> 37:56.755
- Can I tell you something?
- Yes.

37:56.756 --> 37:58.558
You said you wouldn't compete with them,

37:58.559 --> 38:01.862
but you designed a computer
specifically for the education market,

38:01.863 --> 38:03.929
which they putatively own.

38:03.930 --> 38:07.833
So, I think it's cool they're here.

38:07.834 --> 38:10.036
They're suing me.

38:10.037 --> 38:11.605
Still.

38:11.606 --> 38:13.707
It was nice they came.

38:15.242 --> 38:17.176
They're not being magnanimous.

38:17.177 --> 38:19.179
They want it to look
like an amicable divorce.

38:19.180 --> 38:22.047
History doesn't remember Joe
DiMaggio kindly for dumping Marilyn.

38:22.048 --> 38:23.283
Steve?

38:25.119 --> 38:26.920
What's your problem?

38:26.921 --> 38:30.123
I don't know, but I'm sure
it can be traced back to you.

38:30.124 --> 38:33.792
You know, I'm the one who
has to explain you to people.

38:33.793 --> 38:36.830
$100,000 to Paul Rand for a corporate logo

38:36.831 --> 38:39.632
when we didn't even know
what our company made.

38:39.633 --> 38:43.069
A $650,000 mold for the cube,

38:43.070 --> 38:46.172
because God forbid the
angles be 90.1 instead of 90.

38:46.173 --> 38:49.208
I forbid the angles to
be 90.1 instead of 90.

38:49.209 --> 38:51.777
That box could be on
display at the Guggenheim.

38:51.778 --> 38:54.013
Don't give them reason to say to the press

38:54.014 --> 38:55.949
you have a chip on your shoulder.

38:55.950 --> 38:57.717
Will you do that for me?

38:57.718 --> 38:59.319
I don't have a chip on my shoulder.

38:59.320 --> 39:00.953
Okay, okay.

39:00.954 --> 39:04.658
But don't give them a reason to say you do.

39:04.659 --> 39:06.159
I don't.

39:06.160 --> 39:08.228
- That's the right attitude.
- That's not an attitude.

39:08.229 --> 39:10.696
They're gonna call me back in
a minute to look at the light.

39:10.697 --> 39:12.866
- Get one out of the way.
- Fine!

39:12.867 --> 39:16.335
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:16.336 --> 39:18.737
- One more thing.
- Sure.

39:18.738 --> 39:21.040
No questions from the press after.

39:21.041 --> 39:23.275
No... Why?

39:23.276 --> 39:26.346
Until I have better
answers, no press avail.

39:26.347 --> 39:30.450
Somebody asks where I am, you just
saw me, and I'll be right back.

39:32.218 --> 39:33.688
Okay.

39:35.590 --> 39:37.857
Who do you want first?

39:37.858 --> 39:41.028
Bring me the face of Steve Wozniak.

39:49.336 --> 39:52.739
Hang on.

39:52.740 --> 39:55.174
- I thought you went to school.
- Hang on.

39:55.175 --> 39:57.911
You were supposed to go to school
an hour ago. I thought you left.

39:57.912 --> 40:00.279
I didn't wake up my mom
on time this morning.

40:00.280 --> 40:02.081
It's happened before too.

40:02.082 --> 40:06.152
I wake up with the alarm and then
I get dressed and eat breakfast,

40:06.153 --> 40:08.821
but sometimes I forget to see
what time it is after that.

40:08.822 --> 40:11.690
- Why doesn't your mom just set her own alarm clock?
- It's one of my chores.

40:11.691 --> 40:14.893
I don't understand what that has
to do with why you're still...

40:14.894 --> 40:16.196
Where's your mother?

40:16.197 --> 40:18.297
<i>She went to find a pay phone.</i>

40:18.298 --> 40:20.199
An hour ago, she said...

40:20.200 --> 40:22.034
You don't have to raise your hand.

40:22.035 --> 40:24.804
- You said it was off by a little.
- It is.

40:24.805 --> 40:26.806
- I just measured it.
- Joanna...

40:26.807 --> 40:28.775
Exactly a foot on all four sides.

40:28.776 --> 40:30.310
There are six sides.

40:30.311 --> 40:32.411
But you're not supposed
to be here right now.

40:32.412 --> 40:35.681
We know if four of the sides
are equal to each other,

40:35.682 --> 40:38.085
the other two must be equal as well.

40:39.186 --> 40:41.388
The top, bottom, right and left

40:41.389 --> 40:43.757
are about a millimeter shorter
than the front and back.

40:43.758 --> 40:45.257
They're not. I measured them.

40:45.258 --> 40:47.793
Lisa, I'm kind of an expert in design.

40:47.794 --> 40:50.897
And that's a 20-cent ruler. You think
there's a chance it could be off?

40:50.898 --> 40:54.433
If I had another ruler, I would measure
this ruler, but I really doubt it's off.

40:54.434 --> 40:58.337
- When your mother comes back, you have to go to school.
- Because it's a ruler!

40:58.338 --> 40:59.973
Why is it off?

40:59.974 --> 41:01.308
- Did you hear what I just said?
- Yes.

41:01.309 --> 41:03.877
Because sometimes it seems like
you just keep saying what you want

41:03.878 --> 41:05.880
without listening.

41:11.318 --> 41:14.154
I'm listening.

41:14.155 --> 41:17.492
- Is there something you need?
- No.

41:20.461 --> 41:22.094
Why isn't it a perfect cube?

41:22.095 --> 41:24.731
- You've asked me before.
- I forget what it is.

41:26.367 --> 41:27.567
It's an optical anomaly.

41:27.568 --> 41:30.837
To the human eye, a perfect
cube doesn't look like a cube,

41:30.838 --> 41:33.373
so we made it roughly a millimeter
shorter than a foot on two sides.

41:33.374 --> 41:34.940
What's an anomaly?

41:34.941 --> 41:36.810
You've asked me that before too.

41:36.811 --> 41:39.412
I don't know why you keep doing that.

41:42.015 --> 41:44.215
It's an exception. Something
that doesn't fit a pattern.

41:45.285 --> 41:47.353
You have to go to school. Come in!

41:49.122 --> 41:51.324
I think you two have met.

41:51.325 --> 41:52.958
Hello, old friend.

41:52.959 --> 41:56.029
- You look well.
- So do you. So do you.

41:56.030 --> 41:59.998
And they're telling me George is
ready for you to look at the focus.

41:59.999 --> 42:01.500
Take a walk with me.

42:01.501 --> 42:03.103
- Is this Lisa?
- Yeah.

42:03.104 --> 42:05.004
- This can't be Lisa.
- It is.

42:05.005 --> 42:07.005
- Lisa's this big.
- They get taller. Come on.

42:07.006 --> 42:08.908
- Do you remember me?
- She doesn't.

42:08.909 --> 42:10.877
I'm your dad's friend Steve Wozniak.

42:10.878 --> 42:15.047
I apologize. I don't remember you.

42:15.048 --> 42:16.415
You're very polite.

42:16.416 --> 42:18.118
- Woz?
- Yeah.

42:18.119 --> 42:19.953
Chrisann's at a pay
phone. Would you find her?

42:19.954 --> 42:21.020
Yeah.

42:21.021 --> 42:22.788
<i>Good turnout.</i>

42:22.789 --> 42:24.223
- Great turnout.
- Yeah.

42:24.224 --> 42:27.159
- "Insanely great."
- Insanely great.

42:27.160 --> 42:29.462
This is the first time we
haven't played for the same team.

42:29.463 --> 42:32.031
It's like you're releasing
your first solo album.

42:32.032 --> 42:34.967
I, uh... I appreciate your
inviting me to the launch.

42:34.968 --> 42:36.469
I just want to wipe the slate clean.

42:36.470 --> 42:39.105
That's exactly what I want.
That's why I came backstage.

42:39.106 --> 42:41.841
I want you to know, um,
I'll be out there with you.

42:41.842 --> 42:44.210
Any chance I can get you to
go out there instead of me?

42:44.211 --> 42:46.011
I love you, Steve.

42:46.012 --> 42:47.446
I love you too, Woz.

42:47.447 --> 42:50.415
You know, some things were said.

42:50.416 --> 42:52.384
They were. They were said in public.

42:52.385 --> 42:55.455
They were published. Were
you pressured to do it?

42:55.456 --> 42:57.322
Was I what?

42:57.323 --> 43:03.062
Check it out. It's the orchestra
pit for the San Francisco Opera.

43:03.063 --> 43:05.330
Was I pressured to do it?

43:05.331 --> 43:08.433
I once met Seiji Ozawa at Tanglewood.

43:08.434 --> 43:10.870
A thunderous conductor.

43:10.871 --> 43:12.971
Ungodly artfulness and nuance.

43:12.972 --> 43:17.543
And I asked him what exactly a
conductor does that a metronome can't.

43:17.544 --> 43:20.313
- Surprisingly, he...
- He didn't beat the living shit out of you?

43:20.314 --> 43:24.917
That's right. No, he said, "The
musicians play their instruments.

43:24.918 --> 43:26.819
I play the orchestra."

43:26.820 --> 43:30.056
That feels like something that sounds
good, but doesn't mean anything.

43:30.057 --> 43:34.194
Markkula, Sculley... Did they ask
you to slag me off in the press?

43:34.195 --> 43:36.228
I had reason to be angry.

43:36.229 --> 43:37.964
- Did they?
- Absolutely not.

43:37.965 --> 43:39.399
But they asked you to talk.

43:39.400 --> 43:41.201
Apple was under siege.
You'd just left the company.

43:41.202 --> 43:42.935
Someone had to talk to the press.

43:42.936 --> 43:46.371
I'm right here, Woz. The company left me.

43:46.372 --> 43:49.042
I begged you. I begged you.

43:49.043 --> 43:51.243
The Apple II accounted
for 70% of the revenue.

43:51.244 --> 43:53.846
What did you think was gonna happen?

43:53.847 --> 43:57.217
You didn't care enough about
the Apple II or the Lisa.

43:57.218 --> 43:58.851
Let's be really clear.

43:58.852 --> 44:01.755
I didn't care at all about
the Apple II or the Lisa.

44:03.122 --> 44:05.357
I wasn't pressured to do it.

44:05.358 --> 44:11.897
What I said to the press was an honest,
if tempered, reflection of what I believed.

44:11.898 --> 44:13.933
- Woz.
- Yeah?

44:13.934 --> 44:16.335
What the fuck is on your wrist?

44:16.336 --> 44:19.505
- You wanna know?
- I literally can't wait.

44:19.506 --> 44:21.607
Everyone's gonna be
wearing these in 10 years.

44:21.608 --> 44:24.009
It's a Nixie watch, made using Nixie tubes.

44:24.010 --> 44:26.379
This is actually
40-year-old technology.

44:26.380 --> 44:29.315
Cold cathode tubes. They're
operating at 140 volts.

44:29.316 --> 44:31.317
I tilt my wrist 45
degrees, it's right there.

44:31.318 --> 44:33.085
Hours, minutes and seconds.

44:33.086 --> 44:35.520
The way our minds work. Look at that.

44:35.521 --> 44:38.123
Do me a favor. Set the watch
ahead like you're on a plane

44:38.124 --> 44:39.592
and just changed time zones.

44:39.593 --> 44:41.360
Not a problem.

44:41.361 --> 44:45.899
Unscrew that. Just hit the button.

44:45.900 --> 44:50.435
Excuse me. Flight attendant? The man next
to me would appear to be detonating a bomb.

44:50.436 --> 44:52.404
You think this looks like a bomb.

44:52.405 --> 44:55.342
Even right now, I'm not 100% sure it isn't.

44:56.443 --> 44:59.814
- I think maybe once people get used to it...
- No.

45:04.584 --> 45:07.654
I was angry.

45:07.655 --> 45:10.489
You were saying things about the Apple II,
and the way you were treating the team...

45:10.490 --> 45:14.192
Woz. You get a free pass for life.

45:14.193 --> 45:17.630
I got to get back onstage. We got
two minutes of rehearsal time left.

45:17.631 --> 45:21.601
Do you understand how condescending
that just was? Maybe you don't.

45:21.602 --> 45:24.203
I don't want to see you get dragged
off an airplane in plastic handcuffs.

45:24.204 --> 45:27.473
I get a free pass for life from you?

45:27.474 --> 45:30.542
You give out the pass...
Y-Y-You give them to me?

45:30.543 --> 45:32.344
You're gonna have a stroke, little buddy.

45:32.345 --> 45:35.849
What did you do? What did you do?

45:37.318 --> 45:39.252
Why has Lisa not heard of me?

45:39.253 --> 45:42.721
Shit, man, how many
fourth-graders have heard of you?

45:42.722 --> 45:47.092
You can't write code. You're not
an engineer. You're not a designer.

45:47.093 --> 45:49.328
You can't put a hammer to a nail.

45:49.329 --> 45:50.964
I built the circuit board.

45:50.965 --> 45:53.433
The graphical interface
was stolen from Xerox PARC.

45:53.434 --> 45:57.170
Jef Raskin was the leader of the Mac team
before you threw him off his own project.

45:57.171 --> 46:00.373
Everything... Someone
else designed the box.

46:00.374 --> 46:02.308
So how come 10 times in a day,

46:02.309 --> 46:06.112
I read "Steve Jobs is a genius"?

46:06.113 --> 46:07.980
What do you do?

46:07.981 --> 46:09.649
I play the orchestra.

46:09.650 --> 46:11.683
And you're a good musician.
You sit right there.

46:11.684 --> 46:13.719
You're the best in your row.

46:13.720 --> 46:16.054
I came here to clear the air.

46:16.055 --> 46:18.491
- Do you know why I came here?
- Didn't you just answer that?

46:18.492 --> 46:21.326
I came here because
you're gonna get killed.

46:21.327 --> 46:24.330
Your computer's gonna fail.

46:24.331 --> 46:26.766
You had a college and
university advisory board

46:26.767 --> 46:29.735
telling you they need a powerful
workstation for 2,000 to 3,000.

46:29.736 --> 46:32.005
You've priced NeXT at 6,500.

46:32.006 --> 46:34.540
And that doesn't include the
optional $3,000 hard drive,

46:34.541 --> 46:37.243
which people will discover isn't optional.

46:37.244 --> 46:40.279
Because the optical disk
is too weak to do anything.

46:40.280 --> 46:44.417
And the $2,500 laser printer
brings the total to $12,000.

46:44.418 --> 46:46.518
And in the entire world,
you are the only person

46:46.519 --> 46:49.321
who cares that it's
housed in a perfect cube.

46:49.322 --> 46:51.524
You're gonna get killed.

46:51.525 --> 46:54.159
And I came here to stand
next to you while that happens

46:54.160 --> 46:56.161
because that's what friends do.

46:56.162 --> 47:01.034
That's what men do. I don't need your pass.

47:01.035 --> 47:03.469
We go back, so don't talk
to me like I'm other people.

47:03.470 --> 47:05.705
I'm the only one that knows

47:05.706 --> 47:08.708
that this guy here is someone you invented.

47:08.709 --> 47:13.478
I'm standing by you because that
perfect cube that does nothing

47:13.479 --> 47:16.181
is about to be the single biggest failure

47:16.182 --> 47:18.952
in the history of personal computing.

47:20.586 --> 47:23.690
Tell me something else I don't know.

47:29.195 --> 47:30.797
- Back onstage?
- We're out of time.

47:30.798 --> 47:34.500
They've got to mop the
stage and open the house.

47:34.501 --> 47:38.203
If it crashes, it crashes, right?

47:38.204 --> 47:39.739
You'll make a joke.

47:39.740 --> 47:41.339
I'll make a joke.

47:41.340 --> 47:43.775
If it crashes, it crashes.

47:43.776 --> 47:47.446
It's a good slogan. "NeXT.
If it crashes, it crashes."

47:47.447 --> 47:49.614
I'm not just talking about the demo, Steve.

47:49.615 --> 47:52.085
If it tanks, we don't swallow cyanide.

47:52.086 --> 47:54.853
- We go back to the drawing board.
- No more drawing boards.

47:54.854 --> 47:57.422
Invent the Edsel twice, you
don't get any more drawing boards.

47:57.423 --> 47:58.857
Tell me what the plan is.

47:58.858 --> 48:01.259
You have to tell me the
plan, because I don't know.

48:01.260 --> 48:05.098
You're walking around like
you've got "Can't Lose" cards.

48:05.099 --> 48:09.134
The plan will reveal itself to
you when you're ready to see it.

48:09.135 --> 48:11.603
Will I have to drop acid?

48:11.604 --> 48:13.172
Couldn't hurt.

48:13.173 --> 48:14.540
Is there a plan?

48:14.541 --> 48:16.375
Have I ever let you down?

48:16.376 --> 48:18.243
Every single goddamn time.

48:18.244 --> 48:20.212
- Then I'm due.
- Is there?

48:20.213 --> 48:22.214
Joanna, there's a plan.

48:22.215 --> 48:25.784
I just don't wanna put you in a
position where you're lying to people.

48:27.688 --> 48:31.190
Start 15 minutes late so Avie can
recompile and give us a fighting chance.

48:31.191 --> 48:33.493
Jesus Christ. How many times
are we gonna have this con...

48:33.494 --> 48:35.393
- We're not starting late, ever!
- Fine!

48:35.394 --> 48:38.498
- We're not ever starting late.
- Late.

48:38.499 --> 48:42.069
But where do you come
down on starting late?

48:50.177 --> 48:54.614
Lisa's been doing this thing where she
asks me about stuff I've already told her.

48:54.615 --> 48:57.283
She asks me questions, and I know
she already knows the answers.

48:57.284 --> 48:58.717
What's that about?

48:58.718 --> 49:02.855
Kids do that when they're scared one
of their parents is in a bad mood.

49:02.856 --> 49:06.424
They try to get you talking
about something you like.

49:06.425 --> 49:11.696
It's very common and can be treated by
talking to her about things she likes.

49:11.697 --> 49:16.234
Do you have any experience
or training in this field?

49:16.235 --> 49:17.435
No.

49:17.436 --> 49:20.073
Tell them to open the house.

49:26.613 --> 49:30.084
- Where's Lisa?
- She's around.

49:31.885 --> 49:34.853
- What does that mean?
- She's running around the building.

49:34.854 --> 49:37.455
An hour ago, you said you
were taking her to school.

49:37.456 --> 49:40.726
She begged me to let her stay. There
are fathers who would so love...

49:40.727 --> 49:45.263
It is wrong, okay? It is morally
wrong, it's parentally wrong.

49:45.264 --> 49:48.500
It is wrong for you to use Lisa
as a way of getting money from me.

49:48.501 --> 49:51.469
She will know, if she doesn't already,
that that is your primary use for her.

49:51.470 --> 49:53.638
She will hate you for
the rest of your life.

49:53.639 --> 49:57.442
She will see, if she doesn't already, that
her mother is a woman who stands up to men.

49:57.443 --> 49:59.277
By living off of them.

49:59.278 --> 50:02.214
By not letting myself be
imprisoned and degraded by them.

50:04.418 --> 50:07.652
Imprisoned? I can't get rid of you.

50:07.653 --> 50:10.422
I need a doctor and I need a dentist.

50:10.423 --> 50:13.525
I dropped out of college after a
semester, but, okay, let's have a look.

50:13.526 --> 50:15.860
You will support your
daughter and her mother.

50:15.861 --> 50:18.397
Did you pay someone
$1,500 to bless your house?

50:18.398 --> 50:20.799
- Did you hear what I said?
- Did you?

50:20.800 --> 50:22.768
I don't remember how much it was, Steve.

50:22.769 --> 50:25.471
- It was $1,500.
- Well, they don't do it for free.

50:25.472 --> 50:27.005
They don't. They charge $1,500.

50:27.006 --> 50:29.942
How I spend... Fuck. You
know, I'm not even gonna...

50:29.943 --> 50:33.645
Were you about to say, "How I spend
my money is none of your business"?

50:33.646 --> 50:36.915
I have a sinus infection and
I need to see a dentist too.

50:36.916 --> 50:39.618
So you can see how your blessing
budget could have been better spent.

50:39.619 --> 50:42.689
Like on a perfect cube?

50:43.789 --> 50:46.259
- Look at me, Chrisann.
- What?

50:46.260 --> 50:48.326
- You know who I am, right?
- Yes.

50:48.327 --> 50:50.696
- And you know I know people.
- What are you talking about?

50:50.697 --> 50:54.533
Look at me. And you know the
people I know, they know people.

50:54.534 --> 50:55.935
What is this?

50:55.936 --> 50:59.571
If I ever hear again that you've
thrown a cereal bowl at Lisa's head...

50:59.572 --> 51:01.774
- What?
- my private line's gonna ring,

51:01.775 --> 51:04.743
and a voice on the other end
is gonna say, "We're all set."

51:04.744 --> 51:07.013
- That's how I'll learn that you're dead.
- Are you cra...

51:07.014 --> 51:09.281
I threw the bowl on the floor.

51:09.282 --> 51:10.815
I didn't throw it at her head.

51:10.816 --> 51:12.618
She wasn't even in the room.

51:12.619 --> 51:15.554
She was nowhere... I threw
the bowl on the floor.

51:15.555 --> 51:18.658
She's a little girl. You're scaring her.

51:18.659 --> 51:21.359
I'm a grown man. You're scaring me.

51:21.360 --> 51:23.562
Taking out the garbage is a chore.

51:23.563 --> 51:25.630
Clearing the table is a chore.

51:25.631 --> 51:28.301
Waking you up in the morning
is just fucking creepy.

51:28.302 --> 51:31.304
- Please teach me more about being a parent.
- We're all done here.

51:31.305 --> 51:34.607
It means so much coming from
someone who won't admit he is one.

51:34.608 --> 51:36.609
- Stop screaming at Lisa.
- I give her responsibilities.

51:36.610 --> 51:38.743
- Got it.
- One day she's gonna thank me for it.

51:38.744 --> 51:40.712
- Probably in your sleep.
- Fuck off!

51:40.713 --> 51:41.681
Okay.

51:41.682 --> 51:44.482
I never... I never threw
anything at her head.

51:44.483 --> 51:46.886
Steve.

51:46.887 --> 51:49.721
I never would.

51:49.722 --> 51:54.227
Things don't become so because you say so.

51:55.461 --> 51:59.065
There'll be more money in your
account by the end of business.

52:07.474 --> 52:10.144
- Were you being nice?
- Oh, yeah.

52:15.849 --> 52:19.484
- Andy's next.
- Hertzfeld or Cunningham?

52:19.485 --> 52:24.190
Hertzfeld. He's playing with Avie
Tevanian on the computer backstage.

52:25.959 --> 52:30.264
Ladies and gentlemen,
the house is now open.

52:44.778 --> 52:49.013
- ...playing in front of thousands of people.
- Steve!

52:49.014 --> 52:51.917
Can he do it later, Joel?
We go in eight minutes.

52:51.918 --> 52:54.552
- Can I get a quick reaction to the press this morning?
- What about it?

52:54.553 --> 52:57.056
- The size of it, the volume.
- I'll tell you on background...

52:57.057 --> 52:59.458
- I was hoping for a quote from Steve.
- I'll tell you on background

52:59.459 --> 53:02.060
that I've never seen anything
like it in the tech industry.

53:02.061 --> 53:05.063
I called the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
to take out a full-page ad for today,

53:05.064 --> 53:07.400
and do you know what their sales guy said?

53:07.401 --> 53:11.804
"Why bother? It'd be like notifying
Macy's that tomorrow is Christmas."

53:11.805 --> 53:13.873
- You saw the Stewart Alsop newsletter?
- I did.

53:13.874 --> 53:16.107
I'm sorry, Joanna, I need
to get Steve on the record.

53:16.108 --> 53:20.612
The headline was "Dear NeXT,
when can I get my machine?"

53:20.613 --> 53:24.683
- When can he?
- We'll announce the ship date in the next eight to 10 weeks.

53:24.684 --> 53:26.085
Alsop's not talking about the ship date.

53:26.086 --> 53:28.754
He wants to know when he
can get one to play with.

53:28.755 --> 53:30.855
We have a lot of respect for Stewart Alsop,

53:30.856 --> 53:34.692
and we want to get a machine into his hands
so he can tell his subscribers about it.

53:34.693 --> 53:37.429
- And when will that be?
- Very soon.

53:37.430 --> 53:40.098
Couple of days? A week?

53:40.099 --> 53:42.801
Off the record.

53:42.802 --> 53:45.170
- Off the record?
- Completely.

53:45.171 --> 53:48.507
- We think...
- He'll get it when it's finished.

53:48.508 --> 53:50.109
It's not finished?

53:50.110 --> 53:51.411
It's almost finished.

53:51.412 --> 53:54.513
- I've been watching you rehearse the demo for three weeks.
- Yeah.

53:54.514 --> 53:55.947
- What's left?
- A little thing.

53:55.948 --> 53:57.415
- What?
- I think that's enough.

53:57.416 --> 54:00.786
We're off the record, and Joel's always
been good at understanding nuance.

54:00.787 --> 54:03.022
What's left to finish?

54:03.023 --> 54:07.260
I guess, in layman's terms, you'd
have to say we don't have an OS.

54:09.896 --> 54:12.499
- An operating system?
- Yeah.

54:13.733 --> 54:17.536
- What do you mean?
- Well, the OS is what runs the computer.

54:17.537 --> 54:19.471
In fact, it sort of is the computer.

54:19.472 --> 54:21.774
How has it been running? How's
it gonna run this morning?

54:21.775 --> 54:24.143
What do you mean, you don't have an OS?

54:24.144 --> 54:27.679
It's like this. Avie Tevanian
is our chief software designer,

54:27.680 --> 54:28.947
and he wrote a demo program.

54:28.948 --> 54:32.484
It's like we built a great car,
but we haven't built the engine.

54:32.485 --> 54:35.154
So we put a golf cart battery
in there to make it go for a bit.

54:35.155 --> 54:38.022
All this computer knows how to do
right now is demonstrate itself.

54:38.023 --> 54:40.525
You're telling me the only thing
you've built is a black cube?

54:40.526 --> 54:42.495
Yes. Yeah.

54:42.496 --> 54:44.663
But isn't it the coolest
black cube you've ever seen?

54:44.664 --> 54:46.165
Is this... We're off the record.

54:46.166 --> 54:48.734
Is this a strategy or a
problem? If it's a problem...

54:48.735 --> 54:52.737
Do not share proprietary
knowledge with that man.

54:52.738 --> 54:54.906
It's not a problem.

54:54.907 --> 54:56.674
I wouldn't understand it anyway.

54:56.675 --> 54:59.612
I don't understand it either,
and my name's on the patents.

54:59.613 --> 55:02.882
- It's got e-mail.
- Well, e-mail's not just for tech specialists anymore.

55:02.883 --> 55:04.583
Well, it is, but it won't be.

55:04.584 --> 55:09.522
And I assume an e-mail sent on a NeXT computer
can only be received by a NeXT computer?

55:09.523 --> 55:11.524
Closed,
end-to-end.

55:11.525 --> 55:12.991
The new trash can is wrong.

55:12.992 --> 55:15.293
I wanna tell you I appreciate
all the hours you put into it,

55:15.294 --> 55:18.531
but I can't because of how terrible it is.

55:18.532 --> 55:19.964
Go back to the other one.

55:19.965 --> 55:22.567
Why are we still giving
three options on the clock?

55:22.568 --> 55:25.871
- How many options do you want to give?
- Two. Buy it or don't.

55:25.872 --> 55:27.540
Can I talk to you for a second?

55:27.541 --> 55:28.674
Abso-fruitly.

55:28.675 --> 55:30.808
Uh, look, man. Avie's been recompiling,

55:30.809 --> 55:33.112
but he says there may be
some glitches this morning.

55:33.113 --> 55:35.114
If all there are are some glitches,

55:35.115 --> 55:37.815
it'll be a triumph of miraculous magnitude.

55:37.816 --> 55:39.884
Why are you translating for Avie?

55:39.885 --> 55:43.922
I-I didn't want him to find out the hard
way your position on glitches in a demo,

55:43.923 --> 55:45.958
but it sounds like you've mellowed.

55:45.959 --> 55:48.960
I've been growing, Andy. I've
been learning to love myself.

55:48.961 --> 55:51.230
Hmm. I wouldn't have ever
dreamed that was a problem.

55:51.231 --> 55:52.830
Fantastic burn.

55:52.831 --> 55:54.667
You need to go to your seat.

55:54.668 --> 55:57.268
How about Lisa, getting into
a school for gifted kids?

55:57.269 --> 55:59.904
Yeah, she was tested and
it turns out she can fly.

55:59.905 --> 56:02.040
- Seriously, it's a big deal.
- I know it's a big deal.

56:02.041 --> 56:04.576
That's why I built the school a building.

56:04.577 --> 56:07.880
- Well, I'm sure that's not why she got in.
- Really?

56:07.881 --> 56:11.485
Uh, can I show you something
funny from <i>Macworld?</i>

56:14.753 --> 56:18.790
- I can't think of anything I have to do right now.
- It'll make you feel good.

56:18.791 --> 56:21.793
- Joanna! Look at this!
- Oh, Andy, he's only got a couple of minutes.

56:21.794 --> 56:24.362
It's Guy Kawasaki writing in
<i>Macworld.</i> You're gonna like this.

56:24.363 --> 56:26.364
Well, can we all enjoy it later?

56:26.365 --> 56:31.235
He wrote a parody press release
about Apple buying NeXT for your OS.

56:31.236 --> 56:35.139
He imagines a near future where Apple
needs your OS and has to buy NeXT,

56:35.140 --> 56:37.842
and-and you come back as CEO.

56:37.843 --> 56:39.310
He has Gates saying,

56:39.311 --> 56:44.284
"There would now be more innovations
from Jobs that Microsoft could copy."

56:46.019 --> 56:49.989
- You can read it later.
- Thanks.

56:49.990 --> 56:52.625
She would've gotten in without
you donating a building.

56:52.626 --> 56:56.329
Still, it's something to
talk about in the interview.

56:58.764 --> 57:01.266
All right. Good luck.

57:01.267 --> 57:03.403
Thanks.

57:05.005 --> 57:07.038
Give that to me. I'll throw it out for you.

57:07.039 --> 57:10.708
I'm gonna hang on to it.

57:10.709 --> 57:12.277
What?

57:12.278 --> 57:14.813
What?

57:14.814 --> 57:16.848
You ready for Sculley?

57:16.849 --> 57:18.784
Excuse me!

57:18.785 --> 57:20.685
Lisa!

57:20.686 --> 57:22.588
You can't shout!

57:29.796 --> 57:31.698
Lisa?

57:40.907 --> 57:43.477
You have to go.

57:44.711 --> 57:48.381
It's dangerous up here. That's
why I make other people do it.

57:50.115 --> 57:52.451
Who are you hiding from, me or your mom?

57:52.452 --> 57:56.121
I'm not hiding.

57:56.122 --> 57:58.592
Let's go.

58:05.764 --> 58:08.299
What were you listening to?

58:08.300 --> 58:11.870
I'm listening to two
versions of the same song.

58:11.871 --> 58:15.339
Then when I get to the ends, I
rewind to listen to them again.

58:15.340 --> 58:18.844
It's the same song, but
the versions are different.

58:18.845 --> 58:21.380
- What's the song?
- Okay.

58:21.381 --> 58:24.415
So it's a really old song, and
it's called "Both Sides, Now."

58:24.416 --> 58:28.821
- "Both Sides, Now"?
- Yeah.

58:28.822 --> 58:30.888
What's it about?

58:30.889 --> 58:35.293
It's about... There are three
verses: Clouds, love and life.

58:35.294 --> 58:39.998
And the person singing is singing
that they used to think of...

58:39.999 --> 58:41.866
That they used to think about...

58:41.867 --> 58:44.168
- Clouds, love and life?
- Right.

58:44.169 --> 58:48.040
One way, yeah, but now they look
at them another way, and they...

58:48.041 --> 58:53.911
They've come to the conclusion that they
really don't know clouds, love or life at all.

58:53.912 --> 58:56.415
Those are the exact words.

58:56.416 --> 58:57.683
Yeah, Joni Mitchell.

58:57.684 --> 59:01.955
'Cause it's not a really old
song, unless I'm a really old guy.

59:03.088 --> 59:05.324
You have to go to school now.

59:05.325 --> 59:08.527
Do you want me to tell you the
differences between the two versions?

59:08.528 --> 59:09.862
Right now.

59:09.863 --> 59:13.431
The first version is the kind of
thing that you would call girlish.

59:13.432 --> 59:15.933
I didn't mean I want to know
the difference right now.

59:15.934 --> 59:18.402
I meant you have to go to school right now.

59:18.403 --> 59:20.105
I can stay and watch.

59:20.106 --> 59:22.373
You are truant. You're committing a crime.

59:22.374 --> 59:24.976
I'm not gonna miss anything important.

59:24.977 --> 59:27.880
- How do you know?
- I read ahead.

59:27.881 --> 59:31.083
The Pilgrims make it to the New World.

59:31.084 --> 59:32.984
Then the Declaration of Independence.

59:32.985 --> 59:35.020
Yeah, you skipped a couple centuries.

59:35.021 --> 59:37.922
Steve? Chrisann's out there.

59:44.798 --> 59:46.330
Let's go.

59:46.331 --> 59:48.266
Can I make my case for staying?

59:48.267 --> 59:50.236
Nope.

01:00:08.822 --> 01:00:11.889
- She was with me.
- Come on. Your dad doesn't want us to stay.

01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:14.960
That's not true. That's not...

01:00:14.961 --> 01:00:17.328
You have to be in school is all.

01:00:17.329 --> 01:00:20.998
I'm committing a crime right now,
and I don't wanna get in trouble.

01:00:20.999 --> 01:00:23.569
You're not in trouble. I was kidding.

01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:25.103
Okay.

01:00:25.104 --> 01:00:27.605
Hey. What was the second version?

01:00:27.606 --> 01:00:30.843
You said the first version was
girlish. What was the second version?

01:00:32.278 --> 01:00:34.045
I can't really think of the word.

01:00:34.046 --> 01:00:35.848
Okay. Well, have a good day at school.

01:00:35.849 --> 01:00:38.217
- Regretful.
- What?

01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:41.118
Like wishing you could go
back and do things different.

01:00:41.119 --> 01:00:43.388
You're too young to be regretful.

01:00:43.389 --> 01:00:45.891
Not me.

01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:48.627
The person singing the song.

01:00:48.628 --> 01:00:52.499
Got it. Regretful. That
makes sense because...

01:00:55.034 --> 01:00:57.537
I wanna live with you.

01:01:10.048 --> 01:01:12.150
Six minutes.

01:01:12.151 --> 01:01:14.754
- You want to see Sculley?
- No.

01:01:23.528 --> 01:01:26.931
You know all those times I
told you you needed security?

01:01:26.932 --> 01:01:29.535
Here's why.

01:01:34.273 --> 01:01:37.442
I don't know how it is I've
gotten older and you haven't.

01:01:37.443 --> 01:01:40.478
Some deal with the devil
I was never offered.

01:01:40.479 --> 01:01:43.047
So you know what I've been
thinking for the last four years?

01:01:43.048 --> 01:01:46.685
As it turns out, John, I've
never known what you were thinking.

01:01:46.686 --> 01:01:49.453
No newborn baby has control.

01:01:49.454 --> 01:01:51.389
Do you know what I'm talking about?

01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:53.592
In '84, before the Mac launch. You said...

01:01:53.593 --> 01:01:57.161
- Yeah.
- You said that being adopted meant you didn't have control.

01:01:57.162 --> 01:01:58.496
We're starting in a minute, so...

01:01:58.497 --> 01:02:00.998
Why do people think I fired you?

01:02:00.999 --> 01:02:03.102
It's fine, John. It's all behind us.

01:02:06.639 --> 01:02:09.107
Is it? Hmm?

01:02:09.108 --> 01:02:11.745
Don't play stupid. You can't pull it off.

01:02:13.646 --> 01:02:16.949
You came here to ask me why
people think you fired me?

01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:18.985
Why do people think I fired you?

01:02:20.218 --> 01:02:22.856
Just confirm something for me, okay?

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:26.024
You liked the ad, right?

01:02:26.025 --> 01:02:27.692
The commercial... "1984." You liked it.

01:02:27.693 --> 01:02:31.029
- When are you gonna get furniture?
- It's not an easy process.

01:02:31.030 --> 01:02:33.130
It is. You buy a
couch, take it from there.

01:02:33.131 --> 01:02:36.634
I'd be really surprised if you came
here to talk about interior decorating.

01:02:36.635 --> 01:02:38.069
I liked the ad very much.

01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:39.170
- You did?
- You know I did.

01:02:39.171 --> 01:02:41.440
You're a lying son of a
bitch. You tried to kill it.

01:02:41.441 --> 01:02:44.342
- It's time to take a hard look at the Mac.
- It's past time.

01:02:44.343 --> 01:02:48.513
It's overpriced. We
need to drop it to 1,995.

01:02:48.514 --> 01:02:50.449
We need to double the marketing budget,

01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:52.284
put more bodies on an internal hard drive

01:02:52.285 --> 01:02:53.652
and invest in FileServer.

01:02:53.653 --> 01:02:56.321
- Where the hell did you get the idea I tried to kill...
- Lee Clow.

01:02:56.322 --> 01:02:58.089
- Lee's wrong.
- He's lying?

01:02:58.090 --> 01:03:00.257
- He's... mistaken.
- Where would the money come from?

01:03:00.258 --> 01:03:02.460
It would come from finally
getting rid of the Apple II.

01:03:02.461 --> 01:03:04.362
The Apple II is the
only thing making money.

01:03:04.363 --> 01:03:07.466
- You agreed with the board.
- I understood the board's concerns, but I...

01:03:07.467 --> 01:03:09.534
The board's concerns that
we didn't show the product?

01:03:09.535 --> 01:03:11.536
- Among other things, but my question was...
- What other things?

01:03:11.537 --> 01:03:14.672
I'm asking because I'm curious.
You said "among other things."

01:03:14.673 --> 01:03:17.442
Among other things, it was
set in a dystopian galaxy.

01:03:17.443 --> 01:03:19.411
It took place on a planet
where we don't live.

01:03:19.412 --> 01:03:21.446
It was dark and the opposite of our brand.

01:03:21.447 --> 01:03:23.681
<i>And</i> we didn't show the product.

01:03:23.682 --> 01:03:27.451
People talked about the ad but most of
them didn't know what we were selling.

01:03:27.452 --> 01:03:29.487
The Mac needs to sell for 1,995.

01:03:29.488 --> 01:03:33.525
There is no market research telling us
the Mac is failing because it's overpriced.

01:03:33.526 --> 01:03:37.429
It's telling us that people don't like it
because they think it doesn't do anything.

01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:39.764
It's closed,
end-to-end.

01:03:39.765 --> 01:03:42.433
We didn't know it wasn't what
people wanted, but it isn't.

01:03:42.434 --> 01:03:44.502
They want slots, they want
choices, they want options.

01:03:44.503 --> 01:03:46.804
The way we buy stereos...
mix and match components.

01:03:46.805 --> 01:03:49.473
John, listen to me. Whoever
said the customer is always right

01:03:49.474 --> 01:03:51.243
was, I promise you, a customer.

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:53.444
- It had skinheads in it.
- She was liberating them.

01:03:53.445 --> 01:03:56.580
- Liberating the skinheads.
- The ad didn't have anything to do with fucking skinheads.

01:03:56.581 --> 01:03:58.350
We used them as fucking extras.

01:03:58.351 --> 01:03:59.717
Nobody even knows they were skinheads.

01:03:59.718 --> 01:04:02.187
I'm just saying the board had concerns...

01:04:02.188 --> 01:04:04.089
You invented lifestyle advertising.

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:05.824
And our brand was my brand.

01:04:05.825 --> 01:04:08.627
My job is to make a
recommendation to the board.

01:04:08.628 --> 01:04:09.995
We showed a lot of happy
people drinking Pepsi.

01:04:09.996 --> 01:04:13.498
We didn't say the world was going
to end if you bought a Dr. Pepper.

01:04:13.499 --> 01:04:16.268
Recommend that we drop the price
and double the marketing budget.

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:18.770
- I can't.
- <i>And</i> we showed the product.

01:04:18.771 --> 01:04:22.473
We showed it being opened, we showed
it being poured, being consumed.

01:04:22.474 --> 01:04:24.643
What are you gonna do,
recommend that we kill the Mac?

01:04:24.644 --> 01:04:27.046
I already have, Steve.

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:31.149
What? When?

01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:32.717
You think the secret to your success

01:04:32.718 --> 01:04:35.087
was not assuming people knew
what to do with a can of soda?

01:04:35.088 --> 01:04:38.489
I didn't kill the ad, Steve! I'm the
only reason it made it on the air.

01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:40.659
Just now. An hour ago.

01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:42.359
I'm coming from Markkula's house.

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.362
What did he say?

01:04:45.363 --> 01:04:47.466
- What did he say?
- Invent something new.

01:04:47.467 --> 01:04:49.301
I'll give you a team. You can sit in Maui.

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:50.603
The resorts come with couches.

01:04:50.604 --> 01:04:55.806
Wait a minute. Are you saying you
recommended terminating the Mac

01:04:55.807 --> 01:04:57.775
or you recommended taking
me off the Mac team?

01:04:57.776 --> 01:05:00.812
We bought three spots in the
Super Bowl. Two 30's and a 60.

01:05:00.813 --> 01:05:02.681
After we screened it, the
board wanted that money back

01:05:02.682 --> 01:05:04.616
and they asked me to sell off the spots.

01:05:04.617 --> 01:05:07.118
Chiat/Day sold off the
two 30's but not the 60,

01:05:07.119 --> 01:05:08.552
and I let it be known to Lee Clow

01:05:08.553 --> 01:05:10.788
that if he didn't try very
hard to sell the last spot,

01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:12.424
I wouldn't be unhappy.

01:05:12.425 --> 01:05:14.493
If we drop the price
and double the budget...

01:05:14.494 --> 01:05:16.228
Drop the price or double
the budget.

01:05:16.229 --> 01:05:18.763
The only way to do that is to
take money out of the Apple II.

01:05:18.764 --> 01:05:21.533
The Apple II should embarrass
you. It embarrasses me.

01:05:21.534 --> 01:05:23.400
It doesn't embarrass the shareholders.

01:05:23.401 --> 01:05:24.768
I don't give a shit about the shareholders.

01:05:24.769 --> 01:05:27.371
That's why I hired you, so I don't
have to hear about shareholders.

01:05:27.372 --> 01:05:30.808
The shareholders are my problem, and
the board represents the shareholders.

01:05:30.809 --> 01:05:32.676
That's how it works.

01:05:32.677 --> 01:05:35.279
You sure it wasn't Lee Clow who
dragged his feet selling the 60?

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:37.716
At my direction, Steve.

01:05:37.717 --> 01:05:40.585
You think he would have done that
on his own, taken it on himself?

01:05:40.586 --> 01:05:43.288
Yeah. I think he would've done
what it took to save it from you.

01:05:43.289 --> 01:05:45.824
- I was the only thing protecting it.
- You didn't want the ad

01:05:45.825 --> 01:05:48.859
because you were trying to kill the
Mac two months before it launched.

01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:51.063
You are fucking delusional.

01:05:53.832 --> 01:05:55.699
- Can I mention something to you?
- Sure.

01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:58.271
I have no earthly idea why you're here.

01:05:59.838 --> 01:06:03.174
The story of why and how you left Apple,

01:06:03.175 --> 01:06:05.911
which is quickly becoming
mythologized, isn't true.

01:06:05.912 --> 01:06:08.413
- I'm gonna take this to the board myself.
- Don't do that.

01:06:08.414 --> 01:06:10.181
- I <i>am</i> doing that.
- You can't.

01:06:10.182 --> 01:06:12.817
Why?

01:06:12.818 --> 01:06:16.122
They believe you're no longer
necessary to this company.

01:06:20.425 --> 01:06:25.563
I get hate mail, death threats.

01:06:25.564 --> 01:06:29.201
I get death threats.

01:06:29.202 --> 01:06:33.072
My kids are getting taunted.
Why do people think I fired you?

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:36.942
Joanna's gonna call my name in a second.

01:06:36.943 --> 01:06:38.810
- Steve?
- That was unrehearsed.

01:06:38.811 --> 01:06:40.511
Yeah, I'll be there in just a second.

01:06:40.512 --> 01:06:42.746
I gave you your day in court.

01:06:42.747 --> 01:06:44.348
- You gave me?
- I gave the board a clear choice.

01:06:44.349 --> 01:06:47.953
I said, "Do you want to invest in the Apple
II or the Mac?" They chose the Apple II.

01:06:47.954 --> 01:06:50.288
The same people who wanted
to dump the Super Bowl spot.

01:06:50.289 --> 01:06:52.358
And then I got on a plane to China.

01:06:53.892 --> 01:06:56.427
Mr. Sculley. There's a
call for you on Line One.

01:06:56.428 --> 01:06:59.697
Or I almost got on a plane,
because I got a call in the lounge.

01:06:59.698 --> 01:07:01.433
- Who made that call?
- Doesn't matter.

01:07:01.434 --> 01:07:02.967
<i>It matters to
me. Who made the call?</i>

01:07:02.968 --> 01:07:04.168
John Sculley.

01:07:04.169 --> 01:07:06.004
<i>John? If
you get on that plane,</i>

01:07:06.005 --> 01:07:08.906
<i>you'll have lost your
job by the time it lands.</i>

01:07:08.907 --> 01:07:12.509
<i>Steve's been calling the
board. He wants you out.</i>

01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:15.513
<i>I left my bags on the plane.
My shit's still somewhere in Beijing.</i>

01:07:15.514 --> 01:07:18.549
I took a car back to Cupertino in
the middle of the fucking night.

01:07:18.550 --> 01:07:23.355
I know what time it is. I need a quorum
here in one hour and I want Steve here too.

01:07:23.356 --> 01:07:25.857
<i>You took me off the
Mac, and it was bad business.</i>

01:07:25.858 --> 01:07:28.726
- The quorum call was a homicide.
- Right there! Right there.

01:07:28.727 --> 01:07:30.462
That's the part that's bullshit, my friend.

01:07:30.463 --> 01:07:31.929
It was a suicide.

01:07:31.930 --> 01:07:34.665
Because you knew your
cards and I showed you mine.

01:07:34.666 --> 01:07:37.534
I showed you mine, and you did it anyway.

01:07:37.535 --> 01:07:38.937
What did you think I was gonna do?

01:07:38.938 --> 01:07:41.605
I'm okay losing, but I'm not gonna forfeit.

01:07:41.606 --> 01:07:44.308
I'm not okay losing.

01:07:44.309 --> 01:07:46.745
<i>We're losing market share,
and the Mac is losing money.</i>

01:07:46.746 --> 01:07:51.949
Our only hope is the Apple II, which is stagnating
because of its soon-to-be-obsolete DOS.

01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:55.386
Users are already rigging their machines
to run with a CP/M operating system

01:07:55.387 --> 01:07:56.755
that's been built to run on Intel.

01:07:56.756 --> 01:07:58.857
I can't put it more simply than this.

01:07:58.858 --> 01:08:01.859
We need to put our resources
into updating the Apple II.

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:04.562
<i>By taking
resources from the Mac.</i>

01:08:04.563 --> 01:08:05.964
<i>It's failing. That's a fact.</i>

01:08:05.965 --> 01:08:07.998
- It's overpriced.
- There's no evidence that it's...

01:08:07.999 --> 01:08:09.900
I'm the evidence!

01:08:09.901 --> 01:08:13.772
I'm the world's leading expert on
the Mac, John. What's your résumé?

01:08:13.773 --> 01:08:15.706
You're issuing contradictory instructions,

01:08:15.707 --> 01:08:17.709
you're insubordinate,
you make people miserable.

01:08:17.710 --> 01:08:20.844
Our top engineers are
fleeing to Sun, Dell, HP.

01:08:20.845 --> 01:08:22.981
<i>Wall Street doesn't know
who's driving the bus.</i>

01:08:22.982 --> 01:08:25.049
We've lost hundreds of millions in value.

01:08:25.050 --> 01:08:28.685
And I'm the CEO of Apple,
Steve. That's my résumé.

01:08:28.687 --> 01:08:31.522
But before that, you sold
carbonated sugar water, right?

01:08:31.523 --> 01:08:35.426
I sat in a fucking garage with
Wozniak and invented the future.

01:08:35.428 --> 01:08:38.862
Because artists lead and
hacks ask for a show of hands.

01:08:38.863 --> 01:08:39.863
All right.

01:08:39.865 --> 01:08:41.865
Well, this guy's out of control.

01:08:41.866 --> 01:08:44.602
I'm perfectly willing to hand
in my resignation tonight,

01:08:44.603 --> 01:08:46.537
but if you want me to
stay, you can't have Steve.

01:08:46.538 --> 01:08:48.740
Settle him out.

01:08:48.741 --> 01:08:51.843
He can keep a share of stock
so he gets our newsletter.

01:08:51.844 --> 01:08:54.478
<i>He'll have to sever his
connection to Apple.</i>

01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:58.384
I'm dead serious. I want the
secretary to call for a vote.

01:08:59.984 --> 01:09:03.087
I fucking dare you.

01:09:03.089 --> 01:09:08.759
You have done an outstanding job over
the years of cultivating the press.

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.294
And by that, I mean manipulating them.

01:09:10.295 --> 01:09:13.932
Because none of them, none of their
editors, none of their editors' publishers

01:09:13.933 --> 01:09:16.066
to this day know that you forced it,

01:09:16.067 --> 01:09:18.035
<i>that you forced the board.</i>

01:09:18.036 --> 01:09:20.371
<i>Even after I told you
exactly what they'd do,</i>

01:09:20.372 --> 01:09:22.473
which is exactly what they did.

01:09:22.474 --> 01:09:24.875
Unanimously.

01:09:24.876 --> 01:09:27.578
I don't have any trouble
remembering that, John,

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:31.048
because of it being the
worst night of my life.

01:09:31.049 --> 01:09:34.151
And I forced the vote because
I believed I was right.

01:09:34.152 --> 01:09:37.288
I still believe I'm right. And I'm right.

01:09:38.758 --> 01:09:40.524
Now I bled that night.

01:09:40.526 --> 01:09:42.694
<i>And I don't bleed.</i>

01:09:42.694 --> 01:09:44.395
<i>But time's done its thing,</i>

01:09:44.397 --> 01:09:46.997
<i>and I really haven't
thought about it in a while.</i>

01:09:46.999 --> 01:09:51.669
Now, I absolutely
understand why you're upset.

01:09:51.670 --> 01:09:53.737
<i>And I want people to
know the truth too.</i>

01:09:53.738 --> 01:09:55.839
It's time.

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:57.741
Got it.

01:09:57.742 --> 01:09:59.843
You're gonna end me, aren't you?

01:09:59.844 --> 01:10:02.112
You're being ridiculous.

01:10:02.113 --> 01:10:05.482
I'm gonna sit center court
and watch you do it yourself.

01:10:05.483 --> 01:10:09.119
Then I'm gonna order a nice meal with
a '55 Margaux and sign some autographs.

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.856
- Jesus Christ.
- You want some advice, Pepsi Generation?

01:10:11.857 --> 01:10:14.592
Don't send Woz out to slap
me around in the press.

01:10:14.593 --> 01:10:17.195
Anybody else... you, Markkula, Arthur Rock.

01:10:17.196 --> 01:10:18.896
Anyone but Rain Man.

01:10:18.897 --> 01:10:21.432
Don't manipulate him like that.

01:10:21.433 --> 01:10:25.102
Whatever you may think, I'm
always gonna protect him.

01:10:25.103 --> 01:10:27.205
Come on, Steve.

01:10:28.573 --> 01:10:31.176
That's what men do.

01:10:31.177 --> 01:10:33.512
We can't start late.

01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:48.494
I don't think there was any way
to detect a chip on my shoulder.

01:10:49.795 --> 01:10:51.295
Did you know, back at Bandley,

01:10:51.296 --> 01:10:55.600
the Mac team gave an award every year
to the person who could stand up to you?

01:10:55.601 --> 01:10:56.734
No.

01:10:56.735 --> 01:11:01.573
- I won. Three years in a row.
- Cool.

01:11:05.210 --> 01:11:06.811
This.

01:11:06.812 --> 01:11:10.882
This... This Guy Kawasaki
in <i>Macworld.</i>

01:11:10.883 --> 01:11:13.651
He accidentally got it right, didn't he?

01:11:13.652 --> 01:11:15.219
You've been dragging
your feet on the NeXT OS

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:18.623
till you can figure out
what Apple's gonna need.

01:11:20.159 --> 01:11:23.828
Even if that were true, it doesn't
sound that diabolical to me.

01:11:23.829 --> 01:11:25.530
Hey. We're ready for you.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:38.543
I'm your closest confidante,
your... your best friend.

01:11:38.544 --> 01:11:41.713
Your thing... What do you call it?

01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:43.882
Your work wife. The whole time.

01:11:43.883 --> 01:11:45.883
The last three years.

01:11:49.921 --> 01:11:55.660
When did you change your mind and start
building the Steve Jobs Revenge Machine?

01:11:58.630 --> 01:12:00.697
House to half.

01:12:00.698 --> 01:12:03.302
You remember Skylab?

01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:10.941
It was an unmanned satellite NASA sent up in
the early '70s on a data gathering mission.

01:12:10.942 --> 01:12:13.611
The thing is, when they sent it up,

01:12:13.612 --> 01:12:16.146
they didn't know yet how
they were gonna get it back.

01:12:16.147 --> 01:12:18.182
But they felt like they were close enough

01:12:18.183 --> 01:12:21.619
<i>that in the eight years it was gonna
be up there, they'd figure it out.</i>

01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:23.087
They're on their way now.

01:12:23.088 --> 01:12:25.822
They didn't.

01:12:25.823 --> 01:12:27.892
So after eight years, it came crashing down

01:12:27.893 --> 01:12:30.561
in a thousand-mile swath
across the Indian Ocean.

01:12:30.562 --> 01:12:32.996
<i>A little to the left,
a little to the right,</i>

01:12:32.997 --> 01:12:34.966
<i>somebody could have gotten hurt.</i>

01:12:34.967 --> 01:12:39.102
I really wanted to build
a computer for colleges.

01:12:39.103 --> 01:12:41.705
The technology just didn't catch
up as fast as I needed it to.

01:12:41.706 --> 01:12:43.975
<i>You know we're out of money.</i>

01:12:43.976 --> 01:12:46.276
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the
program will be starting momentarily.</i>

01:12:46.277 --> 01:12:49.580
<i>But then Apple stopped
innovating, and I saw something better.</i>

01:12:49.581 --> 01:12:54.718
Joanna, I know schools aren't gonna buy
a $13,000 dictionary with good speakers.

01:12:54.719 --> 01:12:56.755
You know I know that.

01:12:58.590 --> 01:13:00.258
But Apple will.

01:13:00.259 --> 01:13:03.828
'Cause Avie Tevanian is gonna
build them exactly the OS they need.

01:13:03.829 --> 01:13:06.731
<i>They're gonna have to buy me too.</i>

01:13:06.732 --> 01:13:12.671
For half a billion dollars in stock
and end-to-end control on every product.

01:13:43.402 --> 01:13:47.372
Ladies and
gentlemen, please welcome...

01:13:51.009 --> 01:13:54.277
<i>More than a year after it
was first unveiled to industry insiders,</i>

01:13:54.278 --> 01:13:57.014
<i>the NeXT Computer is
finally available in stores.</i>

01:13:57.015 --> 01:14:00.752
<i>And it appears to be
two strikes in a row for Steve Jobs.</i>

01:14:00.753 --> 01:14:02.186
<i>Students and educators</i>

01:14:02.187 --> 01:14:05.289
<i>are finding it difficult to
justify the machine's high cost.</i>

01:14:05.290 --> 01:14:07.191
<i>So much for the black cube.</i>

01:14:07.192 --> 01:14:12.129
<i>NeXT just sold its factory to Canon
and laid off half its employees.</i>

01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:15.165
In the world of computers,
it's kill or be killed.

01:14:15.166 --> 01:14:17.301
Apple Computer has fallen on hard times.

01:14:17.302 --> 01:14:20.103
It is laying off about 2,500 people.

01:14:20.104 --> 01:14:22.306
<i>Apple is
continuing to lose market share,</i>

01:14:22.307 --> 01:14:25.142
<i>with no new innovations in the
pipeline except the Newton,</i>

01:14:25.143 --> 01:14:27.678
<i>a pet project of CEO John Sculley.</i>

01:14:27.679 --> 01:14:30.947
<i>If you really want
to be mobile, you want a Newton PDA.</i>

01:14:30.948 --> 01:14:32.417
<i>But then again, maybe you don't.</i>

01:14:32.418 --> 01:14:35.753
<i>It turns
handwriting into computer text.</i>

01:14:35.754 --> 01:14:39.692
Hey, Dolph, take a memo on
your Newton. "Beat up Martin."

01:14:41.393 --> 01:14:43.261
Bah!

01:14:43.262 --> 01:14:46.030
<i>In 1980,
Apple had 30% of the market.</i>

01:14:46.031 --> 01:14:48.766
<i>Today, Apple has only 3.2 percent.</i>

01:14:48.767 --> 01:14:52.604
<i>That's it. John
Sculley has been fired from Apple.</i>

01:14:53.938 --> 01:14:56.708
What about this Internet
thing? Do you know anything about that?

01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:59.444
It is the big new thing.

01:14:59.445 --> 01:15:02.079
Rumors are flying around
Apple Computer once again

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.714
over who will take over the helm.

01:15:03.715 --> 01:15:06.383
In the news at this hour, a
remarkable high-tech reunion.

01:15:06.384 --> 01:15:09.020
<i>Well, it's
happening. In a billion-dollar shakeup,</i>

01:15:09.021 --> 01:15:12.123
<i>Apple is purchasing NeXT Computer's
operating system, which may mean...</i>

01:15:12.124 --> 01:15:14.726
<i>- Is the prodigal son returning?
- Bet on it.</i>

01:15:14.727 --> 01:15:16.861
Guess what. Mac is back.

01:15:16.862 --> 01:15:18.428
- Apple cofounder Steven Jobs...
- Steve Jobs...

01:15:18.429 --> 01:15:20.330
- Steve Jobs...
- Steve Jobs...
- Steve Jobs...

01:15:20.331 --> 01:15:22.901
<i>Steve
Jobs is returning to Apple.</i>

01:15:24.469 --> 01:15:27.472
<i>If you want to beam your digital
photographs from your digital camera,</i>

01:15:27.473 --> 01:15:29.173
<i>it's built into every product.</i>

01:15:29.174 --> 01:15:31.275
<i>We're going to the
new generation of I/O.</i>

01:15:31.276 --> 01:15:34.178
Twelve megabyte USB. Two ports.

01:15:34.179 --> 01:15:36.748
We're leaving the old Apple I/O behind.

01:15:36.749 --> 01:15:39.383
Stereo surround sound
built into every product,

01:15:39.384 --> 01:15:43.353
a great keyboard and the
coolest mouse you've ever seen.

01:15:43.354 --> 01:15:47.424
This time, we used actual mice.

01:15:47.425 --> 01:15:50.895
We're opening the house
in 10 minutes. Steven?

01:15:50.896 --> 01:15:52.530
Do you want to stop horsing around?

01:15:52.531 --> 01:15:57.000
Bless my eyes. That's Steve
Wozniak sitting out there.

01:16:00.004 --> 01:16:03.441
Give yourselves a treat and ask Woz
if he happens to have the correct time.

01:16:03.442 --> 01:16:07.410
I have the correct time,
and we're running out of it.

01:16:07.411 --> 01:16:11.348
- "A great keyboard"...
- A great keyboard and the coolest mouse you've ever seen.

01:16:11.349 --> 01:16:14.785
This is what those things look like today.

01:16:14.786 --> 01:16:19.456
Now, I'd like to show you what
they're gonna look like tomorrow.

01:16:19.457 --> 01:16:22.360
This is the iMac.

01:16:51.823 --> 01:16:53.324
That was cool.

01:16:53.325 --> 01:16:55.426
Why did I like that
better than I usually do?

01:16:55.427 --> 01:16:57.494
- I don't know.
- Something was different.

01:16:57.495 --> 01:16:59.196
Hey, stupid.

01:16:59.197 --> 01:17:01.432
I think she's talking to one of you guys.

01:17:01.433 --> 01:17:04.235
- Did you notice a difference?
- That's what I'm...

01:17:04.236 --> 01:17:06.937
The exit signs were off.

01:17:06.938 --> 01:17:09.472
- Full blackout.
- You did it.

01:17:09.473 --> 01:17:11.843
We wired all the exit lights to our board.

01:17:11.844 --> 01:17:14.378
They go out with the cue for seven
seconds then come back on again. In theory.

01:17:14.379 --> 01:17:18.115
- We think that's legal?
- No, we're very certain it's not.

01:17:18.116 --> 01:17:20.484
- You want to see some quotes?
- Let's hold off on those.

01:17:20.485 --> 01:17:22.253
No, he'll like 'em.

01:17:22.254 --> 01:17:25.758
- I'll show 'em to you later.
- I'll take 'em now.

01:17:27.159 --> 01:17:29.227
- I'm sorry.
- Pick it up from there, please.

01:17:29.228 --> 01:17:31.995
We only have a couple of
minutes, so let's just do the 360.

01:17:31.996 --> 01:17:35.399
We're gonna bring out a
wireless camera we stole from Panasonic.

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:38.535
I'll show you what this looks like.

01:17:38.536 --> 01:17:41.438
The whole thing is translucent.
You can see into it.

01:17:41.439 --> 01:17:43.975
How's that for a compromise, Woz?

01:17:43.976 --> 01:17:47.544
- You still can't get into it, but you can see into it.
- Fair enough.

01:17:47.545 --> 01:17:51.315
We put stereo speakers in
front, infrared right up here,

01:17:51.316 --> 01:17:53.284
CD-ROM drive in the middle.

01:17:53.285 --> 01:17:56.020
- Nice.
- Dual stereo headphone jacks.

01:17:56.021 --> 01:17:59.257
All the connectors are inside
one beautiful little door here.

01:17:59.258 --> 01:18:02.593
Ethernet. USB.

01:18:02.594 --> 01:18:05.096
Even though this is a
full-blooded Macintosh,

01:18:05.097 --> 01:18:06.931
we're targeting it for the number one use

01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:09.432
the consumers tell us they
want a computer for, which is...

01:18:09.433 --> 01:18:11.602
Let's hold it, please. Hold it.

01:18:11.603 --> 01:18:14.571
The answer was "the Internet."

01:18:14.572 --> 01:18:16.674
- Joanna?
- Yeah.

01:18:17.808 --> 01:18:21.145
Stand in front of me. I want to look at these
quotes, but I don't want Joel to know.

01:18:21.146 --> 01:18:23.349
They're all great.

01:18:25.049 --> 01:18:28.151
"It is not only the coolest-looking
computer introduced in years

01:18:28.152 --> 01:18:29.587
but a chest-thumping statement

01:18:29.588 --> 01:18:34.727
that Silicon Valley's original dream
company is no longer somnambulant."

01:18:36.394 --> 01:18:37.861
It's a word. It means "sleepwalking."

01:18:37.862 --> 01:18:41.499
Steve? I'm sorry. We have to clear
the house if we're gonna start on time.

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:43.467
- We're gonna start on time.
- We're absolutely starting on time.

01:18:43.468 --> 01:18:45.002
Here. Take this.

01:18:45.003 --> 01:18:49.173
Everybody, that's it. They've got to
mop the stage, reset and open the house.

01:18:49.174 --> 01:18:50.708
I love you guys.

01:18:58.951 --> 01:19:00.651
Andy, come on back a minute.

01:19:00.652 --> 01:19:02.955
- Which one?
- Hertzfeld.

01:19:09.428 --> 01:19:13.431
<i>Forbes</i> calls it an
"industry-altering success."

01:19:13.432 --> 01:19:15.634
Look here.

01:19:18.036 --> 01:19:20.236
Why haven't we ever slept together?

01:19:20.237 --> 01:19:22.106
We're not in love. Look.

01:19:24.175 --> 01:19:27.011
- Sculley.
- Look what he said.

01:19:27.012 --> 01:19:32.383
"He has implemented the same simple strategy
that made Apple so successful 15 years ago...

01:19:32.384 --> 01:19:35.621
make hit products and promote
them with terrific marketing."

01:19:36.722 --> 01:19:39.190
- It was nice of him.
- It was.

01:19:39.191 --> 01:19:40.691
I meant it.

01:19:40.692 --> 01:19:44.261
Sightings of J.D. Salinger are
more common than John Sculley.

01:19:44.262 --> 01:19:47.933
I wasn't being sarcastic.
It was nice of him.

01:19:49.067 --> 01:19:51.134
- Do you talk to him?
- No.

01:19:51.135 --> 01:19:53.169
You haven't talked to him since '88?

01:19:53.170 --> 01:19:55.705
I'd have told you if I did.

01:19:55.706 --> 01:19:57.141
Doesn't matter.

01:19:57.142 --> 01:19:58.476
I don't want people
thinking they can cross me

01:19:58.477 --> 01:20:02.178
and then, boom, 15 years later,
I'm cool with it.

01:20:02.179 --> 01:20:05.182
I was kidding.

01:20:05.183 --> 01:20:07.719
What's wrong with you this morning?

01:20:09.054 --> 01:20:11.089
Let's get off the stage.

01:20:12.656 --> 01:20:15.759
"The only thing Apple's providing
now is leadership in colors."

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:17.460
Don't worry about it.

01:20:17.461 --> 01:20:19.562
- What does Bill Gates have against me?
- I don't know.

01:20:19.563 --> 01:20:22.466
You're both out of your
minds. Listen to me.

01:20:22.467 --> 01:20:24.535
He dropped out of a better
school than I dropped out of.

01:20:24.536 --> 01:20:26.404
But he's a tool bag. I'll tell you why.

01:20:26.405 --> 01:20:29.139
Make everything all right with Lisa.

01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:32.343
You know, Joanna? Boundaries.

01:20:32.344 --> 01:20:35.311
You've come to my apartment
at 1:00 AM and cleaned it.

01:20:35.312 --> 01:20:36.713
So tell me where the boundary is.

01:20:36.714 --> 01:20:38.649
There. Let's say it's there.

01:20:38.650 --> 01:20:41.685
If I give you some real projections,

01:20:41.686 --> 01:20:45.489
will you promise not to
repeat them from the stage?

01:20:45.490 --> 01:20:48.526
What do you mean, "real projections"?

01:20:48.527 --> 01:20:52.495
- What have you been giving me?
- Conservative projections.

01:20:52.496 --> 01:20:54.130
Marketing's been lying to me?

01:20:54.131 --> 01:20:57.802
We've been managing expectations
so that you don't not.

01:20:57.803 --> 01:21:00.138
What are the real projections?

01:21:01.406 --> 01:21:04.275
We're gonna sell a million
units in the first 90 days.

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:06.209
20,000 a month after that.

01:21:06.210 --> 01:21:07.611
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

01:21:07.612 --> 01:21:09.346
You see? You wait long enough and...

01:21:09.347 --> 01:21:11.749
What's more, 32% of the sales

01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:15.785
are going to go to people buying
a computer for the first time.

01:21:15.786 --> 01:21:20.490
And 12% are going to people using
some kind of Windows machine.

01:21:20.491 --> 01:21:23.227
That's what Bill Gates has against you.

01:21:24.696 --> 01:21:28.066
And it'll be the fastest-selling
computer in history.

01:21:29.433 --> 01:21:31.468
You brought the company
back from life support

01:21:31.469 --> 01:21:34.538
after going through the misery
of laying off 3,000 people

01:21:34.539 --> 01:21:36.774
and cutting 70% of the product line.

01:21:36.775 --> 01:21:40.178
So, Steven, it's over.

01:21:41.780 --> 01:21:44.280
You're gonna win.

01:21:44.281 --> 01:21:48.384
- It would be criminal not to enjoy this moment.
- I'm enjoying it.

01:21:48.385 --> 01:21:50.420
Make things all right with Lisa.

01:21:50.421 --> 01:21:52.655
- You know...
- Come on.

01:21:52.656 --> 01:21:56.326
I don't like having less
privacy than other people have.

01:21:56.327 --> 01:21:59.896
- Does being a multi-billionaire take some of the sting off that?
- No.

01:21:59.897 --> 01:22:03.133
- All Lisa did...
- All Lisa did was give her blessing.

01:22:03.134 --> 01:22:06.669
- Chrisann sold the house and...
- And Lisa could have done what?

01:22:06.670 --> 01:22:09.272
How was she supposed to stop her
mother from selling her own house?

01:22:09.273 --> 01:22:10.673
That I bought for the two of them.

01:22:10.674 --> 01:22:12.008
How was she supposed to stop her?

01:22:12.009 --> 01:22:15.612
Voicing an objection would have
been a step in the right direction.

01:22:15.613 --> 01:22:18.315
You don't think you're
having a bizarre overreaction

01:22:18.316 --> 01:22:21.819
to a 19-year-old girl allowing
her mother to list her own house?

01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:23.053
She could've tried.

01:22:23.054 --> 01:22:26.757
Was she supposed to stop her
mother, that particular mother...

01:22:26.758 --> 01:22:29.826
She gave Chrisann her blessing to sell
the house and she did it to spite me.

01:22:29.827 --> 01:22:33.864
I don't care if she put a
pipe bomb in the water heater.

01:22:33.865 --> 01:22:36.667
You're going to fix it, now.

01:22:36.668 --> 01:22:39.736
She's been acting weird for
months. She's turned on me.

01:22:39.737 --> 01:22:41.804
- Fix it.
- What the...

01:22:41.805 --> 01:22:43.440
Fix it, Steve.

01:22:43.441 --> 01:22:44.941
- Take it easy.
- Fix it or I quit.

01:22:44.942 --> 01:22:47.178
How about that? I quit,
and you never see me again.

01:22:47.179 --> 01:22:49.114
How about that?

01:22:50.581 --> 01:22:53.551
Tell me what's wrong with you this morning.

01:22:53.552 --> 01:22:56.920
What's been wrong with me for 19 years.

01:22:58.889 --> 01:23:02.860
I've been a witness, and I
tell you, I've been complicit.

01:23:04.362 --> 01:23:08.365
I love you, Steve. You know how much.

01:23:08.366 --> 01:23:13.369
I love that you don't care how much money a
person makes. You care <i>what</i> they make.

01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:17.208
But what you make isn't supposed
to be the best part of you.

01:23:17.209 --> 01:23:19.810
When you're a father,

01:23:19.811 --> 01:23:22.413
that's what's supposed to
be the best part of you.

01:23:22.414 --> 01:23:27.251
And it's caused me two decades of
agony, Steve, that it is for you

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:31.821
the worst.

01:23:31.822 --> 01:23:37.329
It's a little thing.
It's a very small thing.

01:23:38.495 --> 01:23:40.830
Fix it.

01:23:40.831 --> 01:23:46.236
Fix it now, or you can
contact me at my new job...

01:23:46.237 --> 01:23:49.206
working anywhere I want.

01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:52.977
I don't happen to think it is
a little deal. She knew that...

01:23:52.978 --> 01:23:55.378
- No.
- I bought the house for the two of...

01:23:55.379 --> 01:23:56.746
- No.
- What do you mean, "no"?

01:23:56.747 --> 01:24:01.884
I mean no. The house has nothing
to do with why you're angry at Lisa.

01:24:01.885 --> 01:24:04.887
I assure you, the house has everything
to do with why I'm angry at Lisa.

01:24:04.888 --> 01:24:09.560
Have you ever heard the phrase
"reality distortion field"?

01:24:09.561 --> 01:24:13.731
- Yes.
- As in "Steve's reality distortion field"?

01:24:13.732 --> 01:24:16.633
I've heard it. I've read it.
It's been sung to me by Joan Baez.

01:24:16.634 --> 01:24:18.401
What you call a reality distortion field,

01:24:18.402 --> 01:24:20.704
and I'm pretty sure you're
the one who coined the phrase,

01:24:20.705 --> 01:24:22.740
- is the reason we're here.
- I know that.

01:24:22.741 --> 01:24:25.042
If I traded in my bank account for a dollar

01:24:25.043 --> 01:24:27.878
every time somebody told me something
was impossible, I'd come out ahead.

01:24:27.879 --> 01:24:29.913
- I know that too.
- What's the problem?

01:24:29.914 --> 01:24:32.915
- My problem? It sure isn't the house.
- Jo, I...

01:24:32.916 --> 01:24:37.387
It's that you told her you
weren't going to pay for Harvard.

01:24:37.388 --> 01:24:39.423
That child.

01:24:39.424 --> 01:24:41.825
That earnest, unironic kid.

01:24:41.826 --> 01:24:43.826
She told you I wasn't paying her tuition?

01:24:43.827 --> 01:24:46.496
I should have hit you with
something heavy a long time ago.

01:24:46.497 --> 01:24:49.033
Lisa told you I wasn't paying her tuition?

01:24:49.034 --> 01:24:53.303
- Andy told me that.
- Which one?

01:24:53.304 --> 01:24:55.371
Hertzfeld.

01:24:55.372 --> 01:24:56.874
How would Hertzfeld know?

01:24:56.875 --> 01:25:00.910
He wrote Harvard a check for
25,000 to cover the semester.

01:25:00.911 --> 01:25:03.847
Are you fucking... He paid her tuition?

01:25:03.848 --> 01:25:06.717
Isn't that why you just asked to see him?

01:25:06.718 --> 01:25:08.319
No, I asked to see him about something...

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:11.722
Did you tell her you weren't
going to pay for college?

01:25:11.723 --> 01:25:13.723
- Yes, because...
- How could you do that?

01:25:13.724 --> 01:25:16.959
Because her mother, who
is also her landlord...

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:18.928
Hertzfeld? I was ranting.

01:25:18.929 --> 01:25:21.498
I was just, you know... I was
talking. You think I would...

01:25:21.499 --> 01:25:25.602
I was pissed off because Lisa
was trying to piss me off, Joanna.

01:25:25.603 --> 01:25:27.003
That was her intent. I don't know...

01:25:27.004 --> 01:25:29.572
You obviously scared the hell out of her.

01:25:29.573 --> 01:25:33.144
Hertzfeld wrote a check
to Harvard, pay for...

01:25:34.345 --> 01:25:35.978
- Is she here yet?
- I'm sure she is.

01:25:35.979 --> 01:25:38.348
Can you have someone bring her back?

01:25:38.349 --> 01:25:40.084
Yes.

01:25:41.486 --> 01:25:43.421
Thank you.

01:25:46.825 --> 01:25:48.559
You know,

01:25:49.994 --> 01:25:51.695
my grandmother always used to say to me...

01:25:51.696 --> 01:25:54.131
I don't give a shit, Yentl.

01:25:55.733 --> 01:25:57.767
- I'll have someone get Lisa.
- Thank you.

01:25:57.768 --> 01:26:00.036
And if you see Hertzfeld...

01:26:00.037 --> 01:26:01.972
It's Andy.

01:26:01.973 --> 01:26:05.109
Speak of the devil's chief engineer.

01:26:05.110 --> 01:26:06.377
Go.

01:26:06.378 --> 01:26:08.412
Come on in.

01:26:10.415 --> 01:26:12.383
You look great today.

01:26:12.384 --> 01:26:13.851
- Thank you.
- Doesn't she?

01:26:13.852 --> 01:26:17.488
She looks fantastic. Always does. Get out.

01:26:19.390 --> 01:26:21.991
- Well, I think I know why I'm here.
- Do you?

01:26:21.992 --> 01:26:22.726
Steve...

01:26:22.727 --> 01:26:25.596
- Did you send the check yet?
- Yes.

01:26:25.597 --> 01:26:28.831
So Harvard got a tuition check
from Andy Hertzfeld to pay for Lisa?

01:26:28.832 --> 01:26:30.868
I don't think they look that carefully.

01:26:30.869 --> 01:26:33.771
I don't think they'd notice
the check didn't come from you.

01:26:33.772 --> 01:26:36.673
Close one. This was
almost embarrassing for me.

01:26:36.674 --> 01:26:38.609
I understand how...

01:26:38.610 --> 01:26:40.177
I'll wire you the money today.

01:26:40.178 --> 01:26:43.746
I-I understand how you feel.
And I do apologize. I do.

01:26:43.747 --> 01:26:46.016
But let me tell you my thinking.

01:26:46.017 --> 01:26:48.685
I can't even think of an appropriate
analogy to describe what you did.

01:26:48.686 --> 01:26:51.187
I knew you guys would
fix things. You always do.

01:26:51.188 --> 01:26:54.991
But in the meantime, if the money wasn't
there, she'd miss a semester of school.

01:26:54.992 --> 01:26:58.728
- Yeah.
- And she'd have to tell her friends why.

01:26:58.729 --> 01:27:01.197
And she needed things. She needed socks.

01:27:01.198 --> 01:27:05.436
- What?
- It's cold in Cambridge. She needed warm socks.

01:27:05.437 --> 01:27:10.206
- You gave her socks?
- Well, I gave her money for socks.

01:27:10.207 --> 01:27:13.509
You don't get to deputize
yourself as her interim.

01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:15.945
You don't get to override my
decisions. Do you understand?

01:27:15.946 --> 01:27:18.115
You don't get to act
like you're her father.

01:27:18.116 --> 01:27:20.683
Somebody had to.

01:27:20.684 --> 01:27:22.785
What the fuck did you just say to me?

01:27:22.786 --> 01:27:26.656
I've known her since she was six.

01:27:26.657 --> 01:27:28.859
I also consider...

01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:34.130
Chrisann's my friend, outside of what
you and I... outside of our relationship.

01:27:34.131 --> 01:27:36.900
- So you're like a family adviser.
- I'm a family friend.

01:27:36.901 --> 01:27:39.602
Then you probably know that
Lisa's been seeing a therapist.

01:27:39.603 --> 01:27:41.170
- Yeah.
- For many years.

01:27:41.171 --> 01:27:43.474
- Yeah.
- Without my knowledge.

01:27:44.909 --> 01:27:46.776
That really wasn't my business.

01:27:46.777 --> 01:27:50.079
I'm fascinated by what
you think is and isn't your business.

01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:54.218
Lisa's been going to a
therapist and she likes it

01:27:54.219 --> 01:27:57.855
and would love for you and
Chrisann to go with her.

01:27:57.856 --> 01:28:02.493
And the reason you know that is because
you're the one that recommended the therapist.

01:28:02.494 --> 01:28:04.561
Well, I know a guy.

01:28:04.562 --> 01:28:08.466
No, I mean you're the one who
recommended that she see a therapist.

01:28:09.634 --> 01:28:14.036
You know what? It was a while ago,
and I don't remember how the whole...

01:28:14.037 --> 01:28:17.106
You told Chrisann that
Lisa should see a therapist.

01:28:17.107 --> 01:28:20.244
Steve, you're stigmatizing.
It's a perfectly norm...

01:28:20.245 --> 01:28:22.612
It's not...

01:28:22.613 --> 01:28:24.681
My thing was, how can it hurt?

01:28:24.682 --> 01:28:26.651
Let's find out.

01:28:27.719 --> 01:28:29.151
Chrisann is my friend.

01:28:29.152 --> 01:28:32.522
- What was the reason you gave?
- You mean...

01:28:32.523 --> 01:28:36.660
What was the reason you gave Chrisann
why Lisa should see a therapist?

01:28:36.661 --> 01:28:38.794
I don't remember. We
were talking and I said...

01:28:38.795 --> 01:28:42.166
It's pretty much what I just said,
that it certainly couldn't hurt.

01:28:43.634 --> 01:28:47.171
You didn't say that Lisa
needed a strong male role model?

01:28:54.112 --> 01:28:55.680
I did.

01:29:02.253 --> 01:29:07.659
I think it's a miracle she's not robbing
banks with the Symbionese Liberation Army.

01:29:10.295 --> 01:29:15.331
There's no reason in the
world why she should be nice.

01:29:15.332 --> 01:29:17.535
But she is.

01:29:19.937 --> 01:29:24.641
So I helped, because somebody had to.

01:29:30.281 --> 01:29:33.218
I'll wire the money to you this afternoon.

01:29:44.963 --> 01:29:48.130
You threatened me a long time ago.

01:29:48.131 --> 01:29:49.800
Sorry?

01:29:51.835 --> 01:29:54.937
A long time ago... You threatened me once.

01:29:54.938 --> 01:29:57.007
People are attracted to people with talent.

01:29:57.008 --> 01:29:59.209
People without it find that threatening.

01:29:59.210 --> 01:30:01.277
Maybe you should see a therapist.

01:30:01.278 --> 01:30:03.879
Certainly couldn't hurt.

01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:06.216
I meant you literally threatened me.

01:30:06.217 --> 01:30:08.752
At Flint, right before the Mac launch.

01:30:08.753 --> 01:30:11.053
I was recompiling. I was
trying to debug the voice demo.

01:30:11.054 --> 01:30:15.392
You said if I couldn't find a solution,
you'd call me out in front of the audience.

01:30:15.393 --> 01:30:17.861
- Did it say "hello"?
- It did.

01:30:17.862 --> 01:30:21.263
No need to thank me.

01:30:21.264 --> 01:30:25.067
Why do you want people to dislike you?

01:30:25.068 --> 01:30:28.237
I don't want people to dislike me.

01:30:28.238 --> 01:30:31.342
I'm indifferent to whether they dislike me.

01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:35.847
Since it doesn't matter, I always have.

01:30:37.180 --> 01:30:39.084
Really?

01:30:40.351 --> 01:30:44.656
I've always liked you
a lot. That's too bad.

01:30:46.823 --> 01:30:49.693
- Knock 'em dead.
- Thank you.

01:31:11.381 --> 01:31:16.152
What is remarkable, what's
hard to fathom but true,

01:31:16.153 --> 01:31:22.494
is that for a given clock rate, a PowerPC
chip is twice as fast as a Pentium II chip.

01:31:35.372 --> 01:31:37.541
In other words,

01:31:38.742 --> 01:31:41.277
a 266 megahertz G3 chip

01:31:41.278 --> 01:31:46.817
is twice as fast as a
266 megahertz Pentium II.

01:31:49.853 --> 01:31:54.124
Or... a 266 G3

01:31:54.125 --> 01:31:58.227
is equal to about 500 megahertz.

01:31:58.228 --> 01:32:01.330
<i>Do you know
what a coincidence is, Lisa?</i>

01:32:01.331 --> 01:32:03.999
Take a look at <i>Byte</i>
magazine's Byte Marks,

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.670
the gold standard for any...

01:32:11.209 --> 01:32:14.646
Come in.

01:32:17.482 --> 01:32:20.182
I sent someone into the lobby.

01:32:20.183 --> 01:32:22.017
- They found her, and she...
- Where is she?

01:32:22.018 --> 01:32:24.887
She said she'd rather not come back.

01:32:24.888 --> 01:32:27.257
- Why?
- That was it.

01:32:27.258 --> 01:32:30.259
- I'm going out there myself.
- You can't. You can't.

01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:32.027
It'll be a scene out of
<i>Hard Day's Night.</i>

01:32:34.898 --> 01:32:37.267
- Excuse me.
- Hey, Joel.

01:32:37.268 --> 01:32:39.102
Andy said it was okay to come back.

01:32:39.103 --> 01:32:41.739
- Which one?
- Andy Cunningham.

01:32:42.839 --> 01:32:45.808
I can't do this forever. I need
one of them to change their name.

01:32:45.809 --> 01:32:47.910
You call Andy Cunningham "Andrea."

01:32:47.911 --> 01:32:49.311
It doesn't matter what I call them.

01:32:49.312 --> 01:32:51.047
I know who I'm talking
about when I'm talking.

01:32:51.048 --> 01:32:52.915
I need everyone else to
call them different names.

01:32:52.916 --> 01:32:54.952
Give me one second.

01:32:59.223 --> 01:33:01.792
Can you go get her for me, please?

01:33:01.793 --> 01:33:03.459
I just talked to Andy.

01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:05.227
Hertzfeld.

01:33:05.228 --> 01:33:08.464
I'm just trying to scrub this
out of my brain with Drano.

01:33:08.465 --> 01:33:10.866
But I do want to talk to Lisa.

01:33:10.867 --> 01:33:13.402
Okay. Just...

01:33:13.403 --> 01:33:15.706
- Stay cool.
- Okay.

01:33:18.009 --> 01:33:19.744
Thank you.

01:33:27.285 --> 01:33:29.019
Hey, Steve.

01:33:41.464 --> 01:33:44.834
- How are you feeling?
- I'm feeling good, Joel. How about you?

01:33:44.835 --> 01:33:47.503
I don't think I could be in your
business. It changes too quickly.

01:33:47.504 --> 01:33:50.841
Well, I'd hang on, 'cause yours is about
to start changing pretty quickly too.

01:33:50.842 --> 01:33:54.009
This is the third time in 14
years I'm writing about you.

01:33:54.010 --> 01:33:57.414
What do you think so far?

01:33:57.415 --> 01:34:01.183
Excuse me. Avie's looking
for you. He has a new shark.

01:34:01.184 --> 01:34:03.655
- You wanna come backstage for a second?
- Sure.

01:34:06.957 --> 01:34:10.160
- Who's this one?
- Alan Turing.

01:34:10.161 --> 01:34:13.896
Single-handedly won World War II and,
for an encore, invented the computer.

01:34:13.897 --> 01:34:16.098
- He won't be part of the campaign though.
- Why not?

01:34:16.099 --> 01:34:18.535
'Cause you just had to ask me who he was.

01:34:19.870 --> 01:34:21.838
Can I see new shark?

01:34:24.375 --> 01:34:26.543
I like it better than the old shark.

01:34:26.544 --> 01:34:28.178
- Sharks.
- Sharks.

01:34:28.179 --> 01:34:30.079
- How many sharks did you go through?
- A couple.

01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:33.883
- This is the 39th.
- We're on the record.

01:34:33.884 --> 01:34:36.553
- Thirty-nine sharks.
- Okay.

01:34:36.554 --> 01:34:38.621
- You know what's special about this shark?
- What?

01:34:38.622 --> 01:34:43.293
No, I'm really asking, because it looks
exactly like the other 38 sharks to me.

01:34:43.294 --> 01:34:45.294
Let me see it with
the cue, from the profile.

01:34:45.295 --> 01:34:47.163
This is cue 92-B.

01:34:47.164 --> 01:34:51.368
This is a profile here, and this
is what it looks like from the back.

01:34:51.369 --> 01:34:56.172
And one more thing. It eats
Pentium notebooks as a light snack.

01:34:56.173 --> 01:34:59.241
This is the shark.

01:34:59.242 --> 01:35:01.511
I really like it.

01:35:01.512 --> 01:35:03.312
Nobody gets it right the first time,

01:35:03.313 --> 01:35:05.915
but I should have been shown
this shark 15, 20 fish ago.

01:35:05.916 --> 01:35:07.616
- You probably were.
- Lock it in.

01:35:07.617 --> 01:35:09.451
Ten minutes.

01:35:09.452 --> 01:35:13.956
He killed himself by taking a bite
of a poison apple... Alan Turing.

01:35:13.957 --> 01:35:15.091
Yeah.

01:35:15.092 --> 01:35:17.694
There should be statues of that man.

01:35:17.695 --> 01:35:20.062
His name should be on the
lips of schoolchildren.

01:35:20.063 --> 01:35:23.633
The rainbow flag apple with a bite
taken out... That's where it came from?

01:35:23.634 --> 01:35:26.503
No, we picked it off a list
of friendly-sounding words.

01:35:26.504 --> 01:35:29.472
But wouldn't it be great if that
had been the story behind it?

01:35:29.473 --> 01:35:33.075
Steve. Kinda liked the last shark.

01:35:33.076 --> 01:35:35.011
Fuck you.

01:35:35.012 --> 01:35:36.612
I wanted to ask you a favor.

01:35:36.613 --> 01:35:37.813
My friend, a long time ago,

01:35:37.814 --> 01:35:40.583
you asked me a favor before a
product launch, and I said no.

01:35:40.584 --> 01:35:43.018
- You wanted me to acknowledge...
- Hang on.

01:35:43.019 --> 01:35:47.289
If you're about to say you were wrong,
I want to prepare this journalist.

01:35:47.290 --> 01:35:51.628
I was 100% right, and you
were spectacularly wrong.

01:35:51.629 --> 01:35:54.129
But I still owe you a favor, so name it.

01:35:54.130 --> 01:35:55.697
Steve...

01:35:55.698 --> 01:36:00.369
- It can't be acknowledging the Apple II team.
- Acknowledge the Apple II team.

01:36:00.370 --> 01:36:02.172
- How about in private?
- No.

01:36:02.173 --> 01:36:03.606
- Is this a prank?
- No.

01:36:03.607 --> 01:36:05.741
I'm trying to remember that
a 300 megahertz G3 chip...

01:36:05.742 --> 01:36:08.012
Just the top guys.

01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:12.082
Steve.

01:36:15.119 --> 01:36:16.686
- Excuse me, okay?
- Yep.

01:36:16.687 --> 01:36:19.188
One second.

01:36:21.692 --> 01:36:26.096
- She said she'd rather not.
- What do you mean?

01:36:26.097 --> 01:36:29.432
She's sitting with her friends, and
she said she'd rather not come back.

01:36:29.433 --> 01:36:31.433
Okay. Tell her... Take her aside.

01:36:31.434 --> 01:36:33.436
I don't want to embarrass
her in front of her friends.

01:36:33.437 --> 01:36:35.672
But tell her I just scared
the shit out of Andy,

01:36:35.673 --> 01:36:38.209
and this time, nobody's
paying her fucking...

01:36:39.477 --> 01:36:41.544
All right. Don't say that.

01:36:41.545 --> 01:36:44.146
But do your thing where
you sound old and wise

01:36:44.147 --> 01:36:47.417
because of the broad, tragic
European canvas of your life.

01:36:47.418 --> 01:36:50.285
You know I wasn't born in a
19th-century shtetl, right?

01:36:50.286 --> 01:36:52.454
Please tell her it's important.

01:36:52.455 --> 01:36:55.025
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

01:36:55.026 --> 01:36:56.625
- There are people around here, man...
- I know.

01:36:56.626 --> 01:37:00.562
- Including a member of the press.
- I see him.

01:37:00.563 --> 01:37:01.664
Woz.

01:37:01.665 --> 01:37:04.936
Just the top guys, the ones
who are getting laid off.

01:37:06.137 --> 01:37:08.405
Listen, okay?

01:37:08.406 --> 01:37:13.343
Last year, Apple lost one billion dollars.

01:37:13.344 --> 01:37:15.311
I don't even know how that's possible.

01:37:15.312 --> 01:37:17.780
You were less than 90
days from being insolvent.

01:37:17.781 --> 01:37:20.583
I had three different accountants
try to explain it to me.

01:37:20.584 --> 01:37:23.585
The whole place has to be streamlined.

01:37:23.586 --> 01:37:26.188
- Start with two of the accountants.
- I started with the...

01:37:26.189 --> 01:37:29.225
- Joel, could you come offstage? We're gonna go backstage.
- Leave him right there.

01:37:29.226 --> 01:37:33.596
I started with the Apple II team
because we don't make that anymore.

01:37:33.597 --> 01:37:37.333
- Just acknowledge the top guys.
- Have a mimosa and relax.

01:37:37.334 --> 01:37:39.835
You will not blow me off right now, Steve.

01:37:39.836 --> 01:37:42.605
- The top guys deserve...
- There are no top guys.

01:37:42.606 --> 01:37:45.208
All right? On the Apple II
team, there are no top guys.

01:37:45.209 --> 01:37:48.645
They're "B" players, and "B"
players discourage the "A" players.

01:37:48.646 --> 01:37:50.612
I want "A" players at Apple and not Dell.

01:37:50.613 --> 01:37:53.348
They're not "B" players, and
I'm a better judge of that.

01:37:53.349 --> 01:37:55.819
Less than 90 days from insolvency,

01:37:55.820 --> 01:37:59.588
in part because somebody thought
the Newton wasn't a box of garbage.

01:37:59.589 --> 01:38:01.223
- Joel, could you come offstage, please?
- Leave him.

01:38:01.224 --> 01:38:02.659
I'm talking about...

01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:05.261
You guys designed and shipped a
little box of garbage while I was gone.

01:38:05.262 --> 01:38:06.728
I'm talking about the Apple II,

01:38:06.729 --> 01:38:09.531
which is not just a crucial
part of this company's history,

01:38:09.532 --> 01:38:12.102
it is a crucial part of the
history of personal computing.

01:38:12.103 --> 01:38:13.770
For a time.

01:38:13.771 --> 01:38:16.371
The least you can do, if you're
going to downsize these people...

01:38:16.372 --> 01:38:19.174
They're gonna live in the biggest houses
of anyone on the unemployment line.

01:38:19.175 --> 01:38:23.480
Is to acknowledge them. Acknowledge
them and the Apple II during this launch.

01:38:23.481 --> 01:38:25.048
This is a new animal.

01:38:25.049 --> 01:38:29.185
This whole place was built by the Apple
II. <i>You</i> were built by the Apple II.

01:38:29.186 --> 01:38:32.254
As a matter of fact, I was destroyed
by the Apple II and its open system

01:38:32.255 --> 01:38:34.124
so that hackers and hobbyists

01:38:34.125 --> 01:38:37.593
could build ham radios or something.

01:38:37.594 --> 01:38:39.395
And then it nearly destroyed Apple

01:38:39.396 --> 01:38:41.431
when you spent all your money on it

01:38:41.432 --> 01:38:44.700
and developed a grand
total of no new products.

01:38:44.701 --> 01:38:46.669
- The Newton.
- The little box of garbage.

01:38:46.670 --> 01:38:50.775
You guys came up with the Newton.
You want people to know that?

01:38:52.675 --> 01:38:56.146
This is a product launch, not a luncheon.

01:38:56.147 --> 01:38:58.248
The last thing I want to
do is connect the iMac to...

01:38:58.249 --> 01:39:01.217
To the only successful
product that this company has ever made.

01:39:01.218 --> 01:39:04.654
I'm sorry to be blunt, but
that happens to be the truth.

01:39:04.655 --> 01:39:08.624
The Lisa was a failure.
The Macintosh was a failure.

01:39:08.625 --> 01:39:10.692
I don't like talking like this,

01:39:10.693 --> 01:39:15.431
but I am tired of being
Ringo when I know I was John.

01:39:15.432 --> 01:39:16.833
Everybody loves Ringo.

01:39:16.834 --> 01:39:19.903
And I'm tired of being patronized by you.

01:39:21.705 --> 01:39:24.339
You think John became John
by winning a raffle, Woz?

01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:25.708
You think he tricked somebody

01:39:25.709 --> 01:39:28.311
or hit George Harrison over the head?

01:39:28.312 --> 01:39:30.245
He was John because he was John.

01:39:30.246 --> 01:39:34.584
He was John 'cause he wrote "Ticket
to Ride." And I wrote the Apple II.

01:39:34.585 --> 01:39:38.122
- Everybody? I want to clear the auditorium.
- Nobody moves.

01:39:40.456 --> 01:39:42.292
You made a beautiful board,

01:39:42.293 --> 01:39:44.427
which, by the way, you were
willing to give out for free,

01:39:44.428 --> 01:39:46.495
so don't tell me how you built Apple.

01:39:46.496 --> 01:39:48.897
If it weren't for me, you'd be the
easiest "A" at Homestead High School.

01:39:48.898 --> 01:39:53.203
These people live and die by your
praise, so here's your chance.

01:39:53.204 --> 01:39:58.241
Acknowledge that something good happened
that you weren't in the room for.

01:40:01.378 --> 01:40:03.612
- No.
- Steve.

01:40:03.613 --> 01:40:08.184
Do it. It's right. It's...

01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:11.353
It's right.

01:40:11.354 --> 01:40:13.489
Sorry, but no.

01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:16.892
Then let me put it another way.

01:40:16.893 --> 01:40:19.795
I don't think there's a man
who's done more to advance

01:40:19.796 --> 01:40:23.333
the democratization that comes
with personal computing than I have,

01:40:23.334 --> 01:40:24.901
but you've never had any respect for me.

01:40:24.902 --> 01:40:27.004
Now why is that?

01:40:28.272 --> 01:40:29.638
I'd at least consider the possibility

01:40:29.639 --> 01:40:31.673
that it's because you've
never had any for me.

01:40:33.978 --> 01:40:35.712
What the hell is going on here?

01:40:35.713 --> 01:40:39.183
Nothing. Thank you for your time.

01:40:42.686 --> 01:40:45.788
It's done. She's coming back.

01:40:45.789 --> 01:40:48.358
You came a half-inch from putting
this company out of business.

01:40:49.927 --> 01:40:52.162
Now who do I see about that?

01:40:53.296 --> 01:40:55.498
I'm letting you keep your job.

01:40:55.499 --> 01:40:57.902
You get a pass.

01:41:00.403 --> 01:41:01.803
You know, when people used to ask me

01:41:01.804 --> 01:41:04.374
what the difference was
between me and Steve Jobs,

01:41:04.375 --> 01:41:07.477
I would say Steve was the big-picture guy

01:41:07.478 --> 01:41:09.411
and I liked a solid workbench.

01:41:09.412 --> 01:41:11.414
When people ask me what
the difference is now,

01:41:11.415 --> 01:41:13.850
I say "Steve's an asshole."

01:41:13.851 --> 01:41:16.652
Your products are better
than you are, brother.

01:41:16.653 --> 01:41:19.621
That's the idea, brother.

01:41:19.622 --> 01:41:23.459
And knowing that, that's the difference.

01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:26.462
It's not binary.

01:41:26.463 --> 01:41:30.034
You can be decent and
gifted at the same time.

01:41:51.722 --> 01:41:53.856
He didn't mean it.

01:41:53.857 --> 01:41:55.960
Yeah, he did.

01:41:58.429 --> 01:42:00.397
He's a temperamental guy.

01:42:01.598 --> 01:42:03.300
No, he's not.

01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:10.505
It's like five
minutes before every launch,

01:42:10.506 --> 01:42:14.677
everyone goes to a bar, gets drunk
and tells me what they really think.

01:42:14.678 --> 01:42:17.414
She's coming to your dressing room.

01:42:28.025 --> 01:42:30.426
I told you to make
things all right with Lisa.

01:42:30.427 --> 01:42:33.730
I didn't say you had to settle
every blood feud you have.

01:42:33.731 --> 01:42:37.767
Last time blood feuds weren't
settled, I lost the cover of <i>Time.</i>

01:42:37.768 --> 01:42:41.471
Though for the life of me, I still don't know
what the hell Dan Kottke was mad at me about.

01:42:41.472 --> 01:42:44.139
- Kottke didn't lose you the cover of <i>Time.</i>
- Of course he did.

01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:46.776
Would you like me to demonstrate
your capacity to be wrong

01:42:46.777 --> 01:42:48.378
when you're certain you're right?

01:42:48.379 --> 01:42:50.847
Dan Kottke told <i>Time</i>
magazine that I was denying...

01:42:50.848 --> 01:42:52.615
Do you remember the cover?

01:42:52.616 --> 01:42:54.150
- Of <i>Time?</i>
- Yes.

01:42:54.151 --> 01:42:55.918
- Yes.
- What was it?

01:42:55.919 --> 01:42:57.986
- What are you talking about?
- What was on the cover?

01:42:57.987 --> 01:42:59.588
- A computer.
- No.

01:42:59.589 --> 01:43:01.990
It was a sculpture of a computer.

01:43:01.991 --> 01:43:04.561
It was a sculpture.

01:43:05.696 --> 01:43:08.865
<i>Time</i> would have had to have
commissioned it months in advance.

01:43:08.866 --> 01:43:11.066
You were never in the
conversation for Man of the Year.

01:43:11.067 --> 01:43:12.768
Nobody lost you anything.

01:43:12.769 --> 01:43:14.637
<i>...picture
of me and the Mac.</i>

01:43:14.638 --> 01:43:17.673
So what else are you sure about?

01:43:17.674 --> 01:43:20.575
I don't know how I could've missed that.

01:43:20.576 --> 01:43:22.611
- Reality distortion.
- No, seriously.

01:43:22.612 --> 01:43:23.812
Seriously.

01:43:23.813 --> 01:43:26.615
Don't try to win an argument with Lisa.

01:43:26.616 --> 01:43:29.752
Just say you were wrong.

01:43:29.753 --> 01:43:31.856
Come on in, honey.

01:43:32.889 --> 01:43:35.424
- It's not "honey."
- John.

01:43:35.425 --> 01:43:37.627
Get in. Get in. Get out of the hall.

01:43:37.628 --> 01:43:39.061
I was taken in a side entrance.

01:43:39.062 --> 01:43:40.963
I'll go out the same
way. No one will see me.

01:43:40.964 --> 01:43:43.566
- How are you, Joanna?
- I'm good, John.

01:43:43.567 --> 01:43:46.102
I'm just surprised to see you.

01:43:46.103 --> 01:43:48.704
Everyone here really appreciates
the quote you gave to <i>Forbes.</i>

01:43:48.705 --> 01:43:51.507
- You didn't have to do that.
- My pleasure.

01:43:51.508 --> 01:43:54.544
If you want, I can slip you in
the back once the house lights go out.

01:43:54.545 --> 01:43:57.548
- I'm just here to say "good luck."
<i>- Okay.</i>

01:43:58.915 --> 01:44:00.917
You just have a couple of minutes.

01:44:00.918 --> 01:44:03.254
- Would you try to find...
- Yeah.

01:44:07.457 --> 01:44:09.559
You're a good man, John.

01:44:21.905 --> 01:44:25.040
So I brought you a present.

01:44:25.041 --> 01:44:26.709
A Newton.

01:44:26.710 --> 01:44:32.514
Don't take it out of the box, you'll be able
to sell it, which is more than I can say.

01:44:32.515 --> 01:44:34.484
Everything all right there?

01:44:34.485 --> 01:44:36.752
Uh, no...

01:44:36.753 --> 01:44:39.754
Just something Joanna pointed out to me.

01:44:39.755 --> 01:44:43.025
I missed something so obvious about...

01:44:43.026 --> 01:44:44.628
Doesn't matter.

01:44:46.629 --> 01:44:50.098
Look, Wall Street's gonna sit back
and wait to see how you do as CEO,

01:44:50.099 --> 01:44:52.968
so don't let any fluctuation
bother you for the first 12 months.

01:44:52.969 --> 01:44:55.472
Day traders are gonna respond.

01:44:56.506 --> 01:44:58.409
I don't need to school you.

01:44:59.643 --> 01:45:01.843
This your way of telling me I
shouldn't have killed the Newton?

01:45:01.844 --> 01:45:06.281
The most efficient animal
on the planet is the condor.

01:45:06.282 --> 01:45:09.084
The most inefficient animals
on the planet are humans.

01:45:09.085 --> 01:45:11.853
Well, you shouldn't
have killed it for spite.

01:45:11.854 --> 01:45:15.290
That's bad business. Don't do that.

01:45:15.291 --> 01:45:20.663
But a human with a bicycle
becomes the most efficient animal.

01:45:20.664 --> 01:45:22.798
And the right computer...

01:45:22.799 --> 01:45:25.601
a friendly, easy computer
that isn't an eyesore

01:45:25.602 --> 01:45:30.071
but rather sits on your desk with
the beauty of a Tensor lamp...

01:45:30.072 --> 01:45:35.076
The right computer will
be a bicycle for the mind.

01:45:35.077 --> 01:45:37.679
Do you like it?

01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:40.081
I was giving back.

01:45:40.082 --> 01:45:44.219
And what if instead of it
being in the right hands,

01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:46.289
it was in everyone's hands?

01:45:46.290 --> 01:45:48.392
Everyone in the world.

01:45:49.893 --> 01:45:52.962
We'd be talking about the most
tectonic shift in the status quo since...

01:45:52.963 --> 01:45:54.364
Ever.

01:45:54.365 --> 01:45:57.566
I don't know why you've always been
interested in my adoption history,

01:45:57.567 --> 01:46:01.603
but you said it's not like someone
looked at me and gave me back.

01:46:01.604 --> 01:46:03.039
But that is what happened.

01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:05.576
And you're telling me you
have the right computer.

01:46:06.677 --> 01:46:08.977
It's called Macintosh.

01:46:08.978 --> 01:46:11.713
A lawyer couple adopted me first,

01:46:11.714 --> 01:46:14.216
then gave me back after a month.

01:46:14.217 --> 01:46:16.387
They changed their mind.

01:46:17.987 --> 01:46:20.690
Then my parents adopted me.

01:46:20.691 --> 01:46:23.258
My biological mother had
stipulated that whoever took me

01:46:23.259 --> 01:46:26.795
had to be college-educated,
wealthy and Catholic.

01:46:26.796 --> 01:46:29.331
Paul and Clara Jobs were
none of those things,

01:46:29.332 --> 01:46:33.768
so my biological mother wouldn't
sign the adoption papers.

01:46:33.769 --> 01:46:35.070
What happened?

01:46:35.071 --> 01:46:38.607
There was a legal battle
that went on for a while.

01:46:38.608 --> 01:46:41.877
My mother said she refused
to love me for the first year.

01:46:41.878 --> 01:46:43.812
You know, in case they had to give me back.

01:46:43.813 --> 01:46:46.816
You can't refuse to love someone, Steve.

01:46:46.817 --> 01:46:49.685
Yeah, it turns out you can.

01:46:49.686 --> 01:46:53.822
What the hell can a one-month-old do
that's so bad his parents give him back?

01:46:53.823 --> 01:46:56.758
Nothing. There's nothing
a one-month-old can do...

01:46:56.759 --> 01:47:00.029
Have you ever thought about trying
to find your biological father?

01:47:00.030 --> 01:47:01.731
I've met my biological father.

01:47:01.732 --> 01:47:03.600
For that matter, so have you.

01:47:06.236 --> 01:47:08.070
It's called Macintosh.

01:47:08.071 --> 01:47:10.740
- Mr. Steve Jobs.
- Jandali.

01:47:10.741 --> 01:47:12.208
Say hello to John Sculley.

01:47:12.209 --> 01:47:15.777
Jandali owns the place,
and John's the CEO of Pepsi,

01:47:15.778 --> 01:47:19.382
<i>but I'm trying to get him to move to
Cupertino, put a dent in the universe.</i>

01:47:19.383 --> 01:47:21.182
You eat vegan as well?

01:47:21.183 --> 01:47:22.785
You're kidding me.

01:47:22.786 --> 01:47:24.387
No, I'll eat anything.

01:47:24.388 --> 01:47:28.356
Why don't you start off with the Mediterranean
lettuce salad with purslane, mint...

01:47:28.357 --> 01:47:32.261
My sister found him.

01:47:32.262 --> 01:47:34.664
- Does he know?
- No. In fact, he bragged to Mona

01:47:34.665 --> 01:47:36.999
that Steve Jobs comes in
the restaurant all the time.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.935
- You don't want to...
- No.

01:47:39.936 --> 01:47:42.840
<i>Don't you think
you should talk to him?</i>

01:47:44.206 --> 01:47:47.209
He'd probably find a reason to sue me.

01:47:47.210 --> 01:47:49.712
Oh, Steve...

01:47:49.713 --> 01:47:52.815
John, if you're here about your legacy,

01:47:52.816 --> 01:47:54.450
you need to form a line behind Wozniak.

01:47:54.451 --> 01:47:56.718
Wozniak's gonna be fine.

01:47:56.719 --> 01:47:59.922
I'm the guy who fired Steve Jobs.

01:47:59.923 --> 01:48:03.058
Rich, college-educated and Catholic.

01:48:03.059 --> 01:48:07.330
Steve? It's time.

01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:13.570
I've gotta go.

01:48:15.772 --> 01:48:19.376
Did I do this? Screw it up?

01:48:22.245 --> 01:48:24.381
Let's let it go now.

01:48:25.848 --> 01:48:27.750
Has to be time.

01:48:32.222 --> 01:48:34.758
Come be our CEO.

01:48:35.991 --> 01:48:37.894
Yeah. Okay.

01:48:46.335 --> 01:48:49.871
It was the stylus, John.

01:48:49.872 --> 01:48:53.942
- What?
- I killed the Newton because of the stylus.

01:48:53.943 --> 01:48:57.781
If you're holding a stylus, you can't use the
other five that are attached to your wrist.

01:49:01.284 --> 01:49:03.487
Things we could have done together.

01:49:08.825 --> 01:49:11.394
God, the things we could've done.

01:49:27.777 --> 01:49:29.244
I'm paying your tuition.

01:49:29.245 --> 01:49:31.446
Are you crazy? Of course
I'm paying your tuition.

01:49:31.447 --> 01:49:34.984
I must have misunderstood you when
you said you weren't paying my tuition.

01:49:34.985 --> 01:49:37.453
You and your mom selling the
house was a hostile thing to do.

01:49:37.454 --> 01:49:39.254
She needed the money.

01:49:39.255 --> 01:49:41.056
She always needs the money.

01:49:41.057 --> 01:49:45.127
She needs a doctor. She
has a sinus infection.

01:49:45.128 --> 01:49:48.998
She's had the same sinus
infection since 1988.

01:49:48.999 --> 01:49:52.200
I'm gonna take care of my mother.
I'm sorry if that angers you.

01:49:52.201 --> 01:49:54.069
It does anger me, because you're a kid

01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:56.405
and it's not your job to
take care of your mother.

01:49:56.406 --> 01:49:58.440
Is that how yours died?

01:49:58.441 --> 01:50:02.477
Guys, step away, please,
and give them some room.

01:50:02.478 --> 01:50:05.481
When your mom is 90 and can't feed herself,

01:50:05.482 --> 01:50:06.816
you can take care of her.

01:50:06.817 --> 01:50:12.320
But right now, she's 45, perfectly
healthy and can't feed herself.

01:50:12.321 --> 01:50:15.524
You're supposed to work hard at
school and be 19, and that's it.

01:50:15.525 --> 01:50:18.494
- I'll take care of your mother.
- Keep up the good work.

01:50:18.495 --> 01:50:21.096
- What the hell do you want from me?
- I was sent for.

01:50:21.097 --> 01:50:23.833
I bought her a house for $400,000.

01:50:23.834 --> 01:50:25.567
It's worth twice that much today.

01:50:25.568 --> 01:50:28.036
She sold it for two magic
rocks and a bowl of soup.

01:50:28.037 --> 01:50:29.471
It was her house.

01:50:29.472 --> 01:50:31.272
She used that money to
travel through Europe.

01:50:31.273 --> 01:50:33.107
Money which you make her beg for.

01:50:33.108 --> 01:50:35.244
- Steve...
- Don't even start with that.

01:50:35.245 --> 01:50:37.279
Going to Andy and asking for the money?

01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:39.114
That was so off-the-charts
over the line...

01:50:39.115 --> 01:50:42.383
I did not do that. Andy came to me.

01:50:42.384 --> 01:50:45.420
Everybody have an opinion on this?

01:50:45.421 --> 01:50:48.958
I'm sorry, guys. In 30 seconds,
you're going to be late.

01:50:48.959 --> 01:50:52.861
She spends the money on antiques and then
sells them for a fraction of what she paid,

01:50:52.862 --> 01:50:55.063
and she does it with money
I gave to her for you.

01:50:55.064 --> 01:50:56.464
Steve...

01:50:56.465 --> 01:50:58.366
You came to me hysterical when you were 13,

01:50:58.367 --> 01:51:00.268
- asking if you could live with me...
- I was not hysterical.

01:51:00.269 --> 01:51:02.003
Because your mom was
screaming at you every day.

01:51:02.004 --> 01:51:04.138
Thirteen was the second time I asked you.

01:51:04.139 --> 01:51:05.874
The stress of her life
as a spiritual healer.

01:51:05.875 --> 01:51:10.012
I don't believe I said you're a
bad guy. But if I did, I'm sorry.

01:51:13.148 --> 01:51:15.618
Hey. Something happened to you at school,

01:51:15.619 --> 01:51:21.022
some first semester core class that
all freshmen are required to take...

01:51:21.023 --> 01:51:23.892
- I read <i>Time.</i>
- What?

01:51:23.893 --> 01:51:27.495
I have Internet access at school.
I read an old copy of <i>Time,</i>

01:51:27.496 --> 01:51:31.299
and I asked my mom some
questions about my family history.

01:51:31.300 --> 01:51:33.067
That was...

01:51:33.068 --> 01:51:35.169
<i>Time</i> wrote a
mangled piece of journal.

01:51:35.170 --> 01:51:36.571
You were never supposed to read that.

01:51:36.572 --> 01:51:39.074
I had two different Harvard statisticians

01:51:39.075 --> 01:51:41.677
try to reverse-engineer the
equation that you came up with

01:51:41.678 --> 01:51:45.446
to prove that 28% of American
men could be my father.

01:51:45.447 --> 01:51:46.848
Honey, I...

01:51:46.849 --> 01:51:50.652
You know, my mother might be a
troubled woman, but what's your excuse?

01:51:50.653 --> 01:51:54.255
That's why I'm not impressed
with your story, Dad.

01:51:54.256 --> 01:51:56.325
It's that you knew what
I was going through,

01:51:56.326 --> 01:51:58.294
and you didn't do anything about it,

01:51:58.295 --> 01:52:02.032
and that makes you an
unconscionable coward.

01:52:03.599 --> 01:52:05.935
And not for nothing, but
"think" is a verb, all right,

01:52:05.936 --> 01:52:07.335
making "different" an adverb.

01:52:07.336 --> 01:52:09.304
You're asking people to think differently.

01:52:09.305 --> 01:52:11.106
And you can talk about the Bauhaus movement

01:52:11.107 --> 01:52:13.107
and Braun and "Simplicity
is sophistication"

01:52:13.108 --> 01:52:16.445
and Issey Miyake uniforms and
Bob Dylan lyrics all you want,

01:52:16.446 --> 01:52:21.151
but that thing looks like
Judy Jetson's Easy-Bake oven.

01:52:40.370 --> 01:52:41.536
Hey.

01:52:41.537 --> 01:52:44.138
You're gonna start late.

01:52:44.139 --> 01:52:46.342
- You know what Lisa stood for?
- What?

01:52:46.343 --> 01:52:48.544
The computer. The Lisa.
You know what it stood for?

01:52:48.545 --> 01:52:51.679
I'm sorry I said that about the
iMac. It's not what I really think.

01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:55.683
Behind my back, at the office,
you know what it stood for?

01:52:55.684 --> 01:52:59.253
Local Integrated System
Architecture. I was five.

01:52:59.254 --> 01:53:01.957
- Why couldn't you just lie?
- I did.

01:53:02.992 --> 01:53:05.227
Of course it was named after you.

01:53:05.228 --> 01:53:10.132
Local Integrated System Architecture
doesn't even mean anything.

01:53:10.133 --> 01:53:13.068
Why'd you say it wasn't all those years?

01:53:15.071 --> 01:53:16.973
I honestly don't know.

01:53:19.275 --> 01:53:21.745
Why'd you say you weren't my father?

01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:27.150
I'm poorly made.

01:53:34.656 --> 01:53:38.194
- It's after 9:00. You're gonna be late.
- I don't care.

01:53:43.366 --> 01:53:45.467
- You're writing for the <i>Crimson.</i>
- What?

01:53:45.468 --> 01:53:47.535
The Apple chapter of the
Harvard Alumni Association

01:53:47.536 --> 01:53:49.370
tells me you're writing
for the <i>Crimson.</i>

01:53:49.371 --> 01:53:53.042
Oh. Yeah, a little bit. Essays.

01:53:53.043 --> 01:53:55.811
- I'd like to read one.
- Sure.

01:53:55.812 --> 01:53:58.280
No, I mean now. I'd like to
read one of your essays now.

01:53:58.281 --> 01:54:00.717
Come on. You've got to go on stage.

01:54:02.317 --> 01:54:05.320
The iMac will not be launched until
you give me one of your essays,

01:54:05.321 --> 01:54:08.992
so the world is waiting for you.

01:54:15.598 --> 01:54:18.633
I'm really sorry, guys.

01:54:18.634 --> 01:54:20.202
Good luck.

01:54:33.148 --> 01:54:34.716
I'm gonna put music in your pocket.

01:54:34.717 --> 01:54:36.820
What?

01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:42.790
Hundred songs. A thousand songs. 500 songs.

01:54:42.791 --> 01:54:47.161
Somewhere between 500 and a
thousand songs right in your pocket,

01:54:47.162 --> 01:54:50.499
'cause I can't stand looking at
that inexplicable Walkman anymore.

01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:52.767
You're carrying around a
brick playing cassette tape.

01:54:52.768 --> 01:54:54.636
We're not savages.

01:54:54.637 --> 01:54:57.806
So I'm gonna put a thousand
songs in your pocket.

01:54:57.807 --> 01:55:00.441
