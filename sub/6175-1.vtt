01:00.518 --> 01:05.105
Between the time
when the oceans drank Atlantis...

01:05.272 --> 01:08.942
...and the rise of the sons of Aryas...

01:09.110 --> 01:12.488
...there was an age undreamed of.

01:12.697 --> 01:15.532
And unto this, Conan...

01:15.700 --> 01:19.370
...destined to bear the jeweled crown
of Aquilonia...

01:19.537 --> 01:22.206
...upon a troubled brow.

01:22.374 --> 01:27.711
It is I, his chronicler,
who alone can tell thee of his saga.

01:27.879 --> 01:33.926
Let me tell you of the days
of high adventure.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.591
Fire and wind come from the sky...

04:19.759 --> 04:22.344
...from the gods of the sky.

04:22.762 --> 04:27.516
But Crom is your god.
Crom, and he lives in the earth.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.770
Once, giants lived in the earth, Conan.

04:32.564 --> 04:36.859
And in the darkness of chaos,
they fooled Crom...

04:37.027 --> 04:40.029
...and they took from him
the enigma of steel.

04:40.196 --> 04:44.033
Crom was angered, and the earth shook.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.368
And fire and wind
struck down these giants...

04:46.536 --> 04:49.204
...and they threw their bodies
into the waters.

04:50.040 --> 04:54.460
But in their rage,
the gods forgot the secret of steel...

04:54.669 --> 04:57.129
...and left it on the battlefield.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.715
And we who found it...

05:00.925 --> 05:02.801
...are just men.

05:03.720 --> 05:07.723
Not gods, not giants.

05:07.891 --> 05:09.558
Just men.

05:11.144 --> 05:14.897
The secret of steel
has always carried with it a mystery.

05:15.065 --> 05:19.818
You must learn it, little Conan.
You must learn its discipline.

05:20.445 --> 05:25.074
For no one, no one in this world,
can you trust.

05:25.241 --> 05:29.036
Not men, not women, not beasts.

05:32.415 --> 05:34.500
This you can trust.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.144
Hyah!

08:33.179 --> 08:34.763
Kill that one!

08:58.204 --> 09:00.372
Kill them! Crush them!

13:36.107 --> 13:39.318
The ashes were trampled into the earth...

13:39.486 --> 13:42.404
...and the blood became as snow.

13:42.572 --> 13:45.324
Who knows what they came for?

13:45.492 --> 13:49.286
Weapons of steel or murder?

13:49.913 --> 13:54.541
It was never known,
for their leader rode to the south...

13:54.709 --> 13:59.046
...while children went north
with the Vanir.

13:59.756 --> 14:05.803
No one would ever know
that my lord's people had lived at all.

14:07.597 --> 14:11.934
His was a tale of sorrow.

17:42.187 --> 17:44.146
Sit here.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.858
Sit here.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.953
He did not care anymore.

20:05.121 --> 20:07.873
Life and death...

20:08.750 --> 20:10.626
...the same.

20:11.586 --> 20:15.130
Only that the crowd would
be there to greet him...

20:15.298 --> 20:20.135
...with howls of lust and fury.

20:20.970 --> 20:24.890
He began to realize his sense of worth.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.643
He mattered.

21:01.011 --> 21:06.932
In time, his victories
could not easily be counted.

21:07.100 --> 21:12.146
He was taken to the East, a great prize...

21:12.313 --> 21:17.151
...where the war masters
would teach him the deepest secrets.

21:41.551 --> 21:45.220
Language and writing
were made available.

21:45.388 --> 21:50.225
The poetry of Khitai,
the philosophy of Sung.

21:57.650 --> 22:02.154
And he also came to know
the pleasures of women...

22:02.322 --> 22:07.117
...when he was bred to the finest stock.

23:16.312 --> 23:22.609
But always there remained
the discipline of steel.

23:32.495 --> 23:34.830
My fear is that my sons
will never understand me.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.170
We've won again.

23:42.922 --> 23:46.258
This is good. But what is best in life?

23:46.426 --> 23:48.469
The open steppe...

23:48.636 --> 23:50.346
...fleet horse...

23:50.513 --> 23:55.184
...falcons at your wrist,
and the wind in your hair.

23:55.352 --> 23:59.772
Wrong! Conan, what is best in life?

23:59.939 --> 24:02.858
To crush your enemies,
see them driven before you...

24:03.026 --> 24:05.152
...and to hear the lamentation
of their women.

24:05.320 --> 24:06.362
That is good.

24:07.864 --> 24:09.239
That is good.

24:47.696 --> 24:50.656
Go. Go. You're free.

24:54.911 --> 24:56.412
Go.

24:56.579 --> 24:58.205
It has been surmised...

24:58.373 --> 25:01.583
...that perhaps my lord
was like a wild animal...

25:01.751 --> 25:04.294
...that had been kept too long.

25:04.462 --> 25:06.588
Perhaps, but whatever...

25:06.756 --> 25:13.262
...freedom, so long
an unremembered dream, was his.

29:13.253 --> 29:15.421
Crom.

30:40.465 --> 30:42.424
There's warmth and fire.

30:46.262 --> 30:50.432
Do you not wish to warm yourself
by my fire?

31:40.483 --> 31:42.985
They said you would come.

31:45.989 --> 31:50.951
From the north, a man of great strength.

31:53.163 --> 31:55.372
A conqueror.

31:57.000 --> 32:01.211
A man who would someday be king
by his own hand.

32:02.672 --> 32:04.923
One who would crush the snakes
of the earth--

32:05.091 --> 32:07.301
Snakes? Did you say snakes?

32:13.683 --> 32:17.603
- What is it you seek?
- A standard.

32:18.021 --> 32:19.855
A symbol.

32:20.023 --> 32:22.232
Perhaps on a shield.

32:22.817 --> 32:25.652
Two snakes coming together.

32:27.197 --> 32:29.323
Facing each other...

32:29.741 --> 32:30.783
...but they're one.

32:31.451 --> 32:35.871
With-- With a sun and a moon below.

32:36.581 --> 32:40.501
Black sun, black moon.

32:40.669 --> 32:42.836
Yes.

32:45.006 --> 32:48.384
There's a price, barbarian.

32:54.307 --> 32:55.724
Zamora.

32:58.895 --> 33:03.774
Crossroads of the world.

33:03.942 --> 33:06.902
You will...

33:08.405 --> 33:13.909
...find what you want...

33:14.077 --> 33:18.205
...in Zamora.

34:23.313 --> 34:24.646
Crom.

34:47.837 --> 34:49.630
Food.

34:50.674 --> 34:52.466
Food.

34:57.263 --> 34:59.348
I have not eaten for days.

35:03.853 --> 35:05.938
And who says you will?

35:08.358 --> 35:12.778
Give me food so I have strength
when the wolves come.

35:13.697 --> 35:16.365
Let me die not in hunger...

35:17.659 --> 35:19.284
...but in combat.

35:20.203 --> 35:21.453
Who are you?

35:24.457 --> 35:29.044
I am Subotai, thief and archer.

35:29.587 --> 35:32.881
I am Hyrkanian,
the great order of Kerlait.

35:33.049 --> 35:34.633
So, what are you doing here?

35:36.761 --> 35:38.053
Dinner for wolves.

35:43.852 --> 35:46.228
What gods do you pray to?

35:49.816 --> 35:52.234
I pray to the four winds.

35:53.278 --> 35:54.945
And you?

35:55.113 --> 35:56.905
To Crom.

36:01.953 --> 36:04.288
But I seldom pray to him.

36:04.456 --> 36:05.831
He doesn't listen.

36:08.043 --> 36:10.377
What good is he, then?

36:10.795 --> 36:13.422
Eh, it's just as I've always said.

36:13.590 --> 36:15.591
He is strong.

36:15.759 --> 36:17.843
If I die, I have to go before him...

36:18.553 --> 36:21.764
...and he will ask me,
"What is the riddle of steel?"

36:21.931 --> 36:25.100
If I don't know it, he will cast me
out of Valhalla and laugh at me.

36:25.268 --> 36:28.437
That's Crom, strong on his mountain.

36:30.023 --> 36:33.067
- Eh, my god is greater.
- Heh, heh.

36:33.234 --> 36:36.653
Crom laughs at your four winds.
Laughs from his mountain.

36:36.821 --> 36:39.406
My god is stronger.

36:40.450 --> 36:43.535
He is the everlasting sky.

36:44.496 --> 36:46.789
Your god lives underneath him.

37:28.665 --> 37:31.792
Civilization, ancient and wicked.

37:31.960 --> 37:34.336
Have you ever seen this before?

37:34.504 --> 37:37.506
No. Let's waste no time.

37:56.609 --> 37:57.651
It's good.

37:57.819 --> 38:00.154
You have no idea
how long it's been there.

38:03.491 --> 38:05.034
Stink!

38:06.369 --> 38:09.955
Does it always smell like this?
How does the wind ever get in here?

38:45.492 --> 38:50.496
How about two snakes
coming together over a black sun?

38:50.663 --> 38:52.748
A magnificent standard.

38:52.916 --> 38:57.044
The only snakes I know of are those of Set,
in those cursed towers.

38:57.212 --> 38:59.213
They have spread to every city.

38:59.381 --> 39:01.840
Two, three years ago,
it was just another snake cult.

39:02.008 --> 39:03.592
Now, everywhere.

39:03.760 --> 39:07.971
It is said that they are deceivers.
They murder people in the night.

39:08.139 --> 39:10.349
I know nothing.

39:11.434 --> 39:12.434
Hey.

39:17.732 --> 39:20.484
Black lotus. Stygian. The best.

39:21.653 --> 39:23.237
This better not be Haga.

39:23.405 --> 39:26.073
I would sell Haga to a slayer such as you?

39:26.950 --> 39:31.203
- A pittance to protect you from evil.
- I am evil. Heh.

39:31.371 --> 39:33.747
They're all sluts.

39:35.500 --> 39:36.875
He's dead already.

39:42.257 --> 39:44.299
Can you believe that? Huh?

39:44.467 --> 39:45.926
- Ah.
- Can you be--?

39:53.643 --> 39:56.478
You're too big to be a thief.

40:02.110 --> 40:04.528
Come. Let's leave this place.

40:10.035 --> 40:12.244
You looking for snakes?

40:12.412 --> 40:14.830
They live in the Tower of the Serpent.

40:14.998 --> 40:19.376
Said to have riches without end
and the greatest jewel of all...

40:19.544 --> 40:21.837
...the Eye of the Serpent.

40:22.005 --> 40:26.008
Chew it slowly. It's the good stuff.

41:06.716 --> 41:10.386
- You are not a guard.
- Neither are you.

41:10.553 --> 41:13.514
We're thieves, heh, like yourself.

41:15.225 --> 41:18.352
- Come to climb the tower.
- You don't even have a rope.

41:20.730 --> 41:24.066
Two fools who laugh at death.

41:24.526 --> 41:27.027
Do you know what horrors
lie beyond that wall?

41:27.904 --> 41:29.613
No.

41:32.075 --> 41:33.909
Then you go first.

42:20.457 --> 42:25.085
- What on earth could smell so bad?
- Do you wanna live forever?

43:06.628 --> 43:07.836
That one.

43:08.338 --> 43:10.839
He's the high priest,
second only to Thulsa Doom.

43:11.216 --> 43:13.842
They say Thulsa Doom's
a thousand years old.

43:18.723 --> 43:21.016
I'll see what's here.
Go find out what's below.

47:41.569 --> 47:42.778
Infidel!

47:57.127 --> 47:59.461
Infidels!

48:23.194 --> 48:24.278
Kill them!

48:28.825 --> 48:30.451
Do you wanna live forever?

52:30.483 --> 52:36.739
All manner of pleasures
and diversions were indulged.

52:36.906 --> 52:39.533
Wealth can be wonderful.

52:41.411 --> 52:45.831
But you know,
success can test one's mettle...

52:45.999 --> 52:51.086
...as surely as the strongest adversary.

53:14.569 --> 53:20.115
They were taken to the hall
of King Osric, the Usurper.

53:20.283 --> 53:24.286
Once a powerful Northman like my lord...

53:24.454 --> 53:27.748
...but now old and sotted.

53:32.921 --> 53:35.130
These are the thieves
you have requested, sire.

53:35.799 --> 53:37.299
I thought there were three.

53:37.467 --> 53:42.471
Uh, our companion, he died in the gardens.
Lions ate him.

53:43.014 --> 53:44.306
Lions ate him?

53:51.815 --> 53:54.608
Lions ate him.

54:04.828 --> 54:06.161
You know what you've done?

54:08.581 --> 54:14.128
Why, Rexor himself has come before me,
threatened me, the king.

54:14.295 --> 54:19.508
What daring! What outrageousness!
What insolence! What arrogance!

54:27.350 --> 54:29.768
I salute you.

54:36.026 --> 54:41.905
Thulsa Doom.
I've chafed for years at this demigod.

54:42.073 --> 54:45.576
Snakes in my beautiful city.

54:45.744 --> 54:50.789
To the west, Nemedia, Aquilonia.
To the south, Koth, Stygia.

54:50.957 --> 54:55.044
Snakes. Everywhere, these evil towers.

54:55.211 --> 54:59.631
You alone have stood up to their guards.
And what are you?

54:59.799 --> 55:01.300
Thieves.

55:08.099 --> 55:09.808
You see this?

55:10.769 --> 55:14.730
They call it the Fangs of the Serpent.

55:14.898 --> 55:19.068
And this one was thrust
into a father's heart...

55:19.235 --> 55:21.612
...by his very son.

55:22.655 --> 55:28.744
And my own daughter has fallen
under this Thulsa Doom's spell.

55:30.413 --> 55:35.334
Is there a dagger such as this
in her hand for me?

55:37.629 --> 55:40.130
She follows him as a slave...

55:40.298 --> 55:43.592
...seeking for the truth of her soul...

55:43.760 --> 55:46.512
...as if I could not give it to her.

55:53.395 --> 55:58.691
As we speak, my daughter travels east...

55:58.858 --> 56:03.237
...to Thulsa Doom
and his Mountain of Power.

56:04.114 --> 56:07.408
She is to be his.

56:15.959 --> 56:20.212
Steal my daughter back.
Take all you can carry.

56:24.884 --> 56:30.055
There's more. There's much more.
Enough to become kings yourselves.

56:34.769 --> 56:40.941
There comes a time, thief,
when the jewels cease to sparkle...

56:41.109 --> 56:44.361
...when the gold loses its luster...

56:44.529 --> 56:47.823
...when the throne room
becomes a prison...

56:49.409 --> 56:54.830
...and all that is left
is a father's love for his child.

57:01.296 --> 57:04.298
To the hellfires with Thulsa Doom.
He's evil.

57:04.466 --> 57:07.676
A sorcerer who can summon demons.

57:08.178 --> 57:12.848
His followers' only purpose
is to die in his service.

57:14.309 --> 57:16.393
Thousands of them.

57:17.062 --> 57:21.482
This Mountain of Power where he lives
is said to be impregnable.

57:23.568 --> 57:27.196
I have talked to Subotai and he agrees.

57:27.364 --> 57:30.366
Let's take what we have while we live.

57:39.584 --> 57:42.878
I have never had so much as now.

57:44.172 --> 57:47.049
All my life, I've been alone.

57:49.344 --> 57:53.389
Many times I've faced my death
with no one to know.

57:55.892 --> 57:59.561
I would look into the huts and the tents
of others in the coldest dark...

57:59.729 --> 58:03.565
...and I would see figures
holding each other in the night.

58:05.735 --> 58:08.320
But I always passed by.

58:11.950 --> 58:16.578
You and I, we have warmth.

58:16.746 --> 58:19.790
That's so hard to find in this world.

58:21.626 --> 58:27.006
Please, let someone else pass by
in the night.

58:28.091 --> 58:32.928
Let us take the world by the throat
and make it give us what we desire.

01:00:55.905 --> 01:01:01.493
The children of Doom. Doom's children.

01:01:01.661 --> 01:01:06.331
They told my lord the way
to the Mountain of Power.

01:01:06.499 --> 01:01:12.588
They told him to throw down his sword
and return to the earth.

01:01:15.759 --> 01:01:19.803
Time enough for the earth in the grave.

01:02:25.537 --> 01:02:28.372
Ooh.

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:34.420
Once, great men lived here. Giants, gods.

01:02:34.587 --> 01:02:36.338
Once, but long ago.

01:02:44.347 --> 01:02:47.433
It was here that I met my master.

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:50.144
It was no accident...

01:02:50.311 --> 01:02:56.817
...nor is it mere chance
that I am the teller of his tale.

01:02:58.695 --> 01:02:59.695
Hey!

01:03:03.033 --> 01:03:05.617
I'm a wizard, mind you.

01:03:05.785 --> 01:03:11.331
This place is kept by powerful gods
and spirits of kings.

01:03:11.499 --> 01:03:15.669
Harm my flesh
and you will have to deal with the dead.

01:03:16.379 --> 01:03:18.464
Can you summon demons, wizard?

01:03:18.631 --> 01:03:21.967
Yes! I strike at you.

01:03:22.135 --> 01:03:26.055
I would summon a demon more ferocious
than all in hell.

01:03:44.074 --> 01:03:48.327
Mounds have been here
since the time of the Titans.

01:03:48.703 --> 01:03:52.247
Kings buried in them, great kings.

01:03:52.415 --> 01:03:57.336
Domains once glittered like the light
on the windy sea.

01:03:58.088 --> 01:04:02.633
Fire won't burn there. No fire at all.

01:04:02.801 --> 01:04:05.928
That's why I live down here in the wind.

01:04:07.055 --> 01:04:09.014
Do you care for these places?

01:04:09.182 --> 01:04:13.560
I sing to them on nights when they wish.

01:04:13.728 --> 01:04:19.441
I sing of the tales of battles, heroes,
witches and women.

01:04:20.068 --> 01:04:22.277
Nobody bothers me down here.

01:04:22.445 --> 01:04:25.906
Not even Thulsa Doom.

01:04:29.911 --> 01:04:31.704
Do flowers grow around here?

01:04:32.622 --> 01:04:34.331
Flowers?

01:04:43.174 --> 01:04:44.800
Flowers.

01:04:45.885 --> 01:04:48.846
You've not come here
as a pilgrim, have you?

01:04:49.014 --> 01:04:52.224
Oil the sword and feed the horse.

01:04:52.392 --> 01:04:54.977
Have you ever ridden
one of those things before?

01:04:57.522 --> 01:04:58.981
No!

01:05:01.568 --> 01:05:05.863
Warrior, what are the flowers for?

01:05:06.031 --> 01:05:07.072
For a girl.

01:05:31.264 --> 01:05:34.266
Doom, Doom, Doom.

01:05:45.945 --> 01:05:49.323
Doom.

01:05:50.867 --> 01:05:59.166
Doom.

01:07:06.359 --> 01:07:08.819
Where do you think you're going,
brother?

01:07:08.987 --> 01:07:10.738
I am afraid.

01:07:10.905 --> 01:07:15.534
Afraid to bare yourself? Why?

01:07:15.702 --> 01:07:18.412
You're so big and so well grown.

01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:21.040
You should be proud of your body.

01:07:21.207 --> 01:07:26.128
How do you expect to reach emptiness
without knowing your own body?

01:07:26.921 --> 01:07:29.548
Could we talk over there...

01:07:29.716 --> 01:07:32.134
...where the others cannot see?

01:07:32.302 --> 01:07:36.889
Why, yes, brother. Of course.

01:07:49.986 --> 01:07:53.030
I am afraid and I am shy.

01:07:55.033 --> 01:07:57.743
Is this, uh, your robe?

01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:00.287
Priest's robe?

01:08:00.455 --> 01:08:03.165
Yes, it's all I have.

01:08:03.833 --> 01:08:04.875
Good.

01:08:08.797 --> 01:08:11.507
That's all you'll ever need.

01:08:14.719 --> 01:08:16.386
Brother.

01:10:01.785 --> 01:10:03.786
What do you see?

01:10:04.454 --> 01:10:07.039
Uh, infinity.

01:10:07.916 --> 01:10:09.541
Good.

01:11:20.155 --> 01:11:22.823
I see you.

01:11:24.993 --> 01:11:27.703
I have watched you.

01:11:27.871 --> 01:11:32.249
For a thousand years,
I have watched you.

01:11:32.417 --> 01:11:35.878
Doom.

01:11:36.629 --> 01:11:43.886
Doom.

01:11:58.777 --> 01:12:02.654
Who among you still fears death?

01:12:03.406 --> 01:12:06.700
Who will not face emptiness?

01:12:07.744 --> 01:12:09.536
- Infidel!
- Infidel!

01:13:09.139 --> 01:13:11.432
I wish to speak to you now.

01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:22.484
Where is the Eye of the Serpent?

01:13:26.322 --> 01:13:29.908
Rexor says that you gave it to a girl.

01:13:30.368 --> 01:13:34.163
Probably for a mere night's pleasure.
Hmm?

01:13:35.081 --> 01:13:37.249
What a loss.

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:41.962
People have no grasp of what they do.

01:13:43.381 --> 01:13:47.801
You broke into my house,
stole my property...

01:13:47.969 --> 01:13:50.804
...murdered my servants and my pets.

01:13:50.972 --> 01:13:54.308
And that is what grieves me the most.

01:13:55.185 --> 01:13:57.936
You killed my snake.

01:13:58.104 --> 01:14:02.024
Thorgrim is beside himself with grief.

01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:08.447
He raised that snake
from the time it was born.

01:14:12.619 --> 01:14:14.870
You killed my mother.

01:14:15.038 --> 01:14:18.123
You killed my father.
You killed my people!

01:14:18.291 --> 01:14:20.334
You took my father's sword.

01:14:23.713 --> 01:14:25.172
Ah.

01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:28.050
It must have been when I was younger.

01:14:28.885 --> 01:14:32.680
There was a time, boy,
when I searched for steel.

01:14:32.847 --> 01:14:37.309
When steel meant more to me
than gold or jewels.

01:14:38.853 --> 01:14:41.814
The riddle of steel.

01:14:42.607 --> 01:14:44.233
Yes.

01:14:44.401 --> 01:14:46.819
You know what it is, don't you, boy?

01:14:47.862 --> 01:14:51.990
Shall I tell you? It's the least I can do.

01:14:53.743 --> 01:14:59.164
Steel isn't strong, boy. Flesh is stronger.

01:14:59.332 --> 01:15:00.374
Look around you.

01:15:03.837 --> 01:15:05.963
There, on the rocks.

01:15:07.841 --> 01:15:10.342
That beautiful girl.

01:15:11.094 --> 01:15:13.303
Come to me, my child.

01:15:23.231 --> 01:15:25.983
That is strength, boy.

01:15:26.151 --> 01:15:28.277
That is power.

01:15:28.445 --> 01:15:31.780
The strength and power of flesh.

01:15:31.948 --> 01:15:35.951
What is steel
compared to the hand that wields it?

01:15:36.619 --> 01:15:40.581
Look at the strength of your body,
the desire in your heart.

01:15:40.749 --> 01:15:43.876
I gave you this.

01:15:44.044 --> 01:15:46.295
Such a waste.

01:15:49.299 --> 01:15:52.426
Contemplate this on the Tree of Woe.

01:15:58.683 --> 01:16:01.310
Crucify him.

01:19:01.866 --> 01:19:03.283
He said you were a wizard.

01:19:05.245 --> 01:19:07.246
Do the gods owe you any favors?

01:19:11.167 --> 01:19:15.838
There are dangers,
but I see you care little for those.

01:19:16.006 --> 01:19:19.049
The spirits of this place
extract a heavy toll.

01:19:19.217 --> 01:19:20.843
Then I will pay them.

01:20:16.983 --> 01:20:18.525
Drink.

01:20:26.076 --> 01:20:31.580
Sometime soon, perhaps tonight,
they'll try to take him.

01:20:31.748 --> 01:20:36.210
- And if they succeed--
- If they succeed, you'll follow.

01:22:08.011 --> 01:22:11.305
No! No!

01:22:23.151 --> 01:22:24.902
No!

01:22:35.872 --> 01:22:39.249
Stop! Stop!

01:23:08.697 --> 01:23:09.738
They're gone.

01:23:12.826 --> 01:23:14.868
They're gone!

01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:11.133
All the gods, they cannot sever us.

01:24:11.301 --> 01:24:16.055
If I were dead and you still fighting for life,
I'd come back from the darkness...

01:24:16.639 --> 01:24:21.852
...back from the pit of hell
to fight at your side.

01:25:35.719 --> 01:25:39.304
The old man says
the Mountain of Power is hollow.

01:25:40.056 --> 01:25:42.558
Thulsa Doom lives in the mountain.

01:25:43.643 --> 01:25:45.519
What else does he say?

01:25:46.062 --> 01:25:49.231
That in the back of the mountain,
there's a gorge.

01:25:49.858 --> 01:25:50.983
Many caves.

01:25:52.444 --> 01:25:54.737
A thief could get in there,
steal the princess...

01:25:54.904 --> 01:25:57.906
...and be off before she's missed
in the darkness.

01:25:58.074 --> 01:26:01.744
Good thieves could do that,
but not vengeful ones.

01:26:05.248 --> 01:26:09.835
Only the girl.
We kill Thulsa Doom another day.

01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:15.382
Agreed?

01:26:17.886 --> 01:26:19.511
Conan?

01:31:10.929 --> 01:31:13.472
So this is paradise.

01:31:20.313 --> 01:31:22.189
Princess.

01:35:23.056 --> 01:35:24.807
Get them!

01:35:40.448 --> 01:35:42.324
Come on!

01:35:50.834 --> 01:35:52.292
You.

01:38:06.636 --> 01:38:08.429
Help him.

01:38:14.978 --> 01:38:17.604
The infidel defilers...

01:38:18.648 --> 01:38:21.984
...they shall all drown in lakes of blood.

01:38:22.152 --> 01:38:26.113
Now they will know
why they are afraid of the dark.

01:38:26.281 --> 01:38:30.451
Now they will learn
why they fear the night.

01:39:04.402 --> 01:39:06.612
Seek.

01:39:56.746 --> 01:40:02.084
The wizard.
I told him I would pay the gods.

01:40:18.685 --> 01:40:20.644
Hold me.

01:40:23.273 --> 01:40:27.609
Kiss me.

01:40:33.033 --> 01:40:36.785
Let me breathe my last breath
into your mouth.

01:40:38.455 --> 01:40:40.789
I’m so cold.

01:40:46.463 --> 01:40:48.756
So cold.

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:54.386
Keep me...

01:40:56.473 --> 01:40:58.140
...warm.

01:41:01.478 --> 01:41:03.312
Keep...

01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:07.274
...me....

01:42:05.041 --> 01:42:10.212
Hey. Fire won't burn up there.
No fire at all.

01:42:47.417 --> 01:42:49.209
Why do you cry?

01:42:50.712 --> 01:42:54.173
He is Conan, Cimmerian.

01:42:54.924 --> 01:42:56.842
He won't cry.

01:42:58.762 --> 01:43:01.055
So I cry for him.

01:44:26.474 --> 01:44:29.685
He will kill you. He has seen your fires.

01:44:29.894 --> 01:44:33.856
He will come for me,
and when he does, he will kill you.

01:44:48.663 --> 01:44:53.709
I remember days like this
when my father took me to the forest...

01:44:53.877 --> 01:44:56.545
...and we ate wild blueberries.

01:44:57.005 --> 01:44:59.715
More than 20 years ago.

01:44:59.883 --> 01:45:03.385
I was just a boy of 4 or 5.

01:45:04.846 --> 01:45:07.973
The leaves were so dark and green then.

01:45:08.892 --> 01:45:12.853
The grass smelled sweet
with the spring wind.

01:45:16.816 --> 01:45:19.735
Almost 20 years of pitiless combat.

01:45:19.903 --> 01:45:23.530
No rest, no sleep like other men.

01:45:24.366 --> 01:45:27.534
And yet the spring wind blows, Subotai.

01:45:28.328 --> 01:45:30.162
Have you ever felt such a wind?

01:45:31.206 --> 01:45:33.707
They blow where I live too.

01:45:36.044 --> 01:45:38.754
In the north of every man's heart.

01:45:41.341 --> 01:45:43.384
It’s never too late, Subotai.

01:45:44.052 --> 01:45:46.011
No.

01:45:48.223 --> 01:45:51.558
It would only lead me back here
another day.

01:45:53.937 --> 01:45:55.771
In even worse company.

01:46:02.904 --> 01:46:06.115
For us, there is no spring.

01:46:06.616 --> 01:46:11.370
Just the wind that smells fresh
before the storm.

01:46:59.502 --> 01:47:02.338
Hey, old man.
Where'd you get this stuff?

01:47:02.505 --> 01:47:03.672
The dead.

01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:08.427
The gods are pleased with you.
They will watch the battle. Heh.

01:47:08.595 --> 01:47:11.221
- Are they going to help?
- No. Ha, ha.

01:47:11.389 --> 01:47:14.350
- Well, then tell them to stay out of the way.
- Aah! Ha-ha-ha.

01:48:42.022 --> 01:48:43.981
Crom...

01:48:44.441 --> 01:48:47.317
...I have never prayed to you before.

01:48:47.902 --> 01:48:49.778
I have no tongue for it.

01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:55.909
No one, not even you,
will remember if we were good men or bad.

01:48:56.077 --> 01:48:59.038
Why we fought or why we died.

01:48:59.205 --> 01:49:00.456
No.

01:49:00.623 --> 01:49:04.418
All that matters
is that two stood against many.

01:49:04.586 --> 01:49:06.587
That's what's important.

01:49:06.963 --> 01:49:12.426
Valor pleases you, Crom,
so grant me one request.

01:49:13.386 --> 01:49:16.263
Grant me revenge.

01:49:16.848 --> 01:49:21.602
And if you do not listen,
then to hell with you.

01:51:51.628 --> 01:51:52.628
Hyah!

01:52:46.307 --> 01:52:49.810
- That's how we do it.
- I did it. With my spear.

01:54:00.757 --> 01:54:02.508
Do you wanna live forever?

01:54:56.646 --> 01:54:58.772
Doom!

01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:02.026
Don't leave me! My lord!

01:55:10.201 --> 01:55:12.661
No, don't kill me!

01:55:18.835 --> 01:55:21.337
Father!

01:56:28.530 --> 01:56:31.615
Doom.

01:56:32.158 --> 01:56:38.831
Doom.

01:57:45.231 --> 01:57:48.484
The purging is at last at hand.

01:57:48.651 --> 01:57:51.153
The day of doom is here.

01:57:56.159 --> 01:57:59.787
All that is evil, all that have eyes...

01:57:59.996 --> 01:58:02.581
...your parents, your leaders...

01:58:02.749 --> 01:58:06.794
...those who would call themselves
your judges.

01:58:06.961 --> 01:58:09.838
Those who have lied...

01:58:10.006 --> 01:58:12.675
...and corrupted the earth.

01:58:12.842 --> 01:58:15.469
They shall all be cleansed.

01:58:15.637 --> 01:58:19.556
Doom.

01:58:19.724 --> 01:58:22.601
You, my children, are the water...

01:58:23.186 --> 01:58:27.356
...that will wash away
all that has gone before.

01:58:27.524 --> 01:58:31.276
In your hand you hold my light...

01:58:31.444 --> 01:58:34.363
...a gleam in the eye of Set.

01:58:34.531 --> 01:58:38.701
This flame will burn away the darkness...

01:58:39.202 --> 01:58:43.372
...burn you away to paradise!

01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:45.791
Doom.

01:58:48.044 --> 01:58:55.467
Doom.

01:59:19.659 --> 01:59:21.785
My child.

01:59:22.370 --> 01:59:25.330
You have come to me, my son.

01:59:26.916 --> 01:59:30.377
For who now is your father
if it is not me?

01:59:31.880 --> 01:59:34.340
Who gave you the will to live?

01:59:36.384 --> 01:59:40.929
I am the wellspring from which you flow.

01:59:42.307 --> 01:59:44.641
When I am gone...

01:59:45.268 --> 01:59:48.062
...you will have never been.

01:59:49.189 --> 01:59:54.068
What will your world be without me?

01:59:57.614 --> 02:00:05.287
My son.

02:00:06.305 --> 02:00:12.150
