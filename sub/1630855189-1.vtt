WEBVTT

00:12.316 --> 00:13.361
Deep breath.

00:13.448 --> 00:15.537
There we go. Deep breath.

00:15.624 --> 00:17.104
There we go, there we go.

00:17.191 --> 00:18.844
Okay...

00:18.931 --> 00:20.629
okay.

00:20.716 --> 00:22.022
Good, very good.

00:23.545 --> 00:26.113
One last piece, one last piece.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.810
Okay, great.

00:27.897 --> 00:29.072
Dr. Miller,
we're going to need your help.

00:29.159 --> 00:30.378
We've got
a dozen wounded, Captain.

00:31.944 --> 00:33.468
Apply pressure right here.

00:33.555 --> 00:35.513
You're doing well.
You're okay, hang in there.

00:36.253 --> 00:37.907
Help me turn him over, please.

00:37.994 --> 00:39.474
Help me turn him over.

00:39.561 --> 00:40.562
Nice and easy.

00:40.649 --> 00:41.824
Oh, my God.

00:42.955 --> 00:44.044
Jeff.

00:44.131 --> 00:45.349
Oh, my God, honey.

00:45.436 --> 00:47.177
Oh, what happened?

00:48.526 --> 00:49.658
Michelle...

00:51.051 --> 00:52.400
...they put a bomb on me.

00:54.402 --> 00:55.794
Oh, my God.

00:55.881 --> 00:58.188
Everybody, clear out!
There's a bomb!

00:58.275 --> 00:59.842
Go, go, go!Clear out, clear out!

00:59.929 --> 01:01.191
Michelle, you need to get out.

01:01.278 --> 01:04.107
I can fix this, I can fix this.

01:04.194 --> 01:05.587
Blue to ignite, red--

01:06.066 --> 01:08.372
Honey, please, go.

01:08.459 --> 01:10.026
Somebody's got to be there
for Bobby.

01:10.113 --> 01:12.028
No, no, I am not leaving you.

01:12.115 --> 01:13.073
I love you.

01:14.291 --> 01:15.858
No! No! No!

01:39.795 --> 01:41.884
It's okay. You got it.

01:41.971 --> 01:44.191
It's arterial!
Gotta bypass the tourniquet!

01:44.278 --> 01:45.670
We need a clamp!
We need a clamp!

01:45.757 --> 01:47.411
Please...

01:47.498 --> 01:49.413
Shit, dropped it.
Hang in there. Hang in there.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.545
It hurts!

01:50.632 --> 01:51.850
Fuck! Fuck!I know.

01:51.937 --> 01:53.461
Almost there, almost there.

01:53.548 --> 01:55.463
Push 50 milligrams
of Midazolam right now.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.029
Quickly!

01:57.813 --> 01:59.206
BP is dropping, doctor.

01:59.293 --> 02:00.729
I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die.

02:00.816 --> 02:01.991
You're not going anywhere.
Lower his head.

02:02.948 --> 02:05.473
You're not going anywhere, okay?
Hang in, hang in.

02:05.560 --> 02:06.648
You're okay.

02:06.735 --> 02:08.171
Hang in there.

02:08.258 --> 02:09.477
Okay, okay.

02:09.564 --> 02:10.565
He's stabilizing.

02:11.783 --> 02:14.177
There you go. There you go.

02:14.569 --> 02:15.744
Thank you.

02:16.962 --> 02:18.529
Thank you.

02:21.271 --> 02:22.838
Hey, Frank.
How you doing, man?

02:22.925 --> 02:24.535
Hey, doc, you're in early.

02:24.622 --> 02:26.842
Yeah, giving my favorite doctor
the night off.

02:29.061 --> 02:30.324
Hey.

02:30.411 --> 02:31.499
Hey.

02:36.460 --> 02:39.159
Just beating myself up
over here.

02:39.246 --> 02:42.205
I've been told
you saved his life.

02:43.206 --> 02:46.253
I dropped the clamp,
like, what...

02:46.340 --> 02:49.517
Hey, it takes guts
to bypass a tourniquet.

02:50.344 --> 02:52.868
I don't know of any other doctor
that would have done that.

02:52.955 --> 02:55.958
Afghan Combat Training 101.

02:56.045 --> 02:58.874
"Think outside the box
because ISIS
thinks outside everything."

02:58.961 --> 03:00.571
Mm-hmm.

03:00.658 --> 03:03.531
But you have always had
ice in your veins.

03:03.618 --> 03:06.403
I suppose that's what cools
that big heart of yours.

03:10.233 --> 03:12.583
That patient
was lucky to have you.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.675
You're going to be fine.

03:17.762 --> 03:20.374
You were the best doc I had
over there...

03:20.461 --> 03:22.158
and you are the best here.

03:25.509 --> 03:27.294
I appreciate you
bringing me on here.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.819
One day at a time.

03:30.906 --> 03:32.560
One foot in front of the other.

03:32.647 --> 03:34.562
Nothing more than that.

03:36.564 --> 03:38.000
All right.

03:59.064 --> 04:00.892
Jeff! Oh, my God.

04:03.199 --> 04:04.809
Clear out! There's a bomb!
Clear out!

04:04.896 --> 04:06.855
Michelle, you need to leave.
Now!

04:06.942 --> 04:08.770
Honey, please, go.

04:08.857 --> 04:10.641
Somebody's gotta
be here for Bobby.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.817
I am not leaving,
I am not leaving.

04:12.904 --> 04:14.776
I am not leaving you. No! No!

04:37.842 --> 04:39.322
Surprise!

04:39.409 --> 04:41.846
Bobby, hey!

04:44.545 --> 04:46.808
You ready?Yeah, just about.

04:47.243 --> 04:48.853
Did Granny come in with you?

04:48.940 --> 04:50.725
Just dropped me off.
Big day at the bingo hall.

04:50.812 --> 04:53.510
Oh, really?
Working her magic, huh?

04:55.599 --> 04:56.774
I have something for you.

04:57.601 --> 04:58.907
Take a seat.

04:58.994 --> 05:01.039
Eyes closed.Why?

05:01.126 --> 05:02.650
Just 'cause.

05:04.129 --> 05:05.740
No peeking.

05:05.827 --> 05:07.611
I'm not peeking.No peeking.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.265
Hands out.

05:09.352 --> 05:11.093
What could it be?

05:13.095 --> 05:14.618
A soccer ball?Ah, man!

05:14.705 --> 05:15.837
How could you tell?

05:15.924 --> 05:17.447
I don't know, how could I?

05:19.754 --> 05:21.321
Yes!

05:21.408 --> 05:23.975
But it's not my birthday
until tomorrow.

05:24.062 --> 05:25.542
I know, but...

05:25.629 --> 05:28.197
I figured we'd go downtown,
grab some dinner,

05:28.284 --> 05:30.417
and by the time we get home,
it might as well be.

05:30.504 --> 05:31.592
Why?

05:32.201 --> 05:34.072
Are we going somewhere
after dinner?

05:35.422 --> 05:36.901
Look inside the scarf.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.601
No way!
Tickets for tonight?

05:40.688 --> 05:41.689
Mm-hmm.

05:42.559 --> 05:44.692
I love you. Thanks!

05:48.870 --> 05:50.306
All right. I'm gonna fill out
a quick report.

05:50.393 --> 05:51.829
I need you to hang
in the waiting area.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.222
I'll walk you out
and get you settled.

05:53.309 --> 05:56.138
Mom, I'm basically an adult.

05:56.225 --> 05:58.009
I think I know
where the waiting room is.

05:58.662 --> 06:01.796
You're right, you are.

06:01.883 --> 06:03.188
All right,
I'll be right there.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.244
Special Agent McBride,
this is Agent Ellis.

06:15.331 --> 06:18.029
You are Ryan Ethan Quinn.

06:18.116 --> 06:21.555
Born 1991, Limerick, Ireland.

06:21.642 --> 06:23.557
Immigrated
to these United States

06:23.644 --> 06:26.473
with charming brother,
Sean James Quinn,

06:26.560 --> 06:30.738
and the big Shillelagh himself,
Patrick "Big Boy" Quinn,

06:30.825 --> 06:33.393
patriarch of
this whole sordid mess

06:33.480 --> 06:37.048
that is the
Quinn Gang Brotherhood.

06:37.135 --> 06:38.615
Quinn family,

06:38.702 --> 06:40.748
suspected of
seven counts of homicide,

06:40.835 --> 06:42.750
twelve counts of armed robbery,

06:42.837 --> 06:44.534
a list of jury tampering,

06:44.621 --> 06:46.623
trafficking, extortion charges,

06:46.710 --> 06:48.277
tax evasion.

06:48.364 --> 06:50.279
Guess you're the unlucky one
to get caught.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.587
Caught?

06:53.674 --> 06:55.589
Or targeted
as a way to get to my father?

06:55.676 --> 06:59.331
Ryan, we know
you love your father,

06:59.419 --> 07:01.290
you've made that
abundantly clear,

07:01.377 --> 07:03.335
but this family's going down,
whether you like it or not.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.859
Now, if you help us

07:04.946 --> 07:06.643
provide evidence
against his business,

07:06.730 --> 07:08.776
we could cut
a sweet deal for you

07:08.863 --> 07:09.951
and for your brother, Sean,

07:10.038 --> 07:11.343
and for your father.

07:13.476 --> 07:15.173
Now, you've tried
this sort of thing before,

07:15.260 --> 07:17.741
this bargain,

07:17.828 --> 07:20.048
but it didn't work then,
it's not working now.

07:20.135 --> 07:22.006
My father runs
a clean operation.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.966
Now, I suggest
you give me that phone call

07:25.053 --> 07:27.229
so I can call
my fancy lawyer friends.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.231
You don't fool me, Quinn.

07:30.319 --> 07:32.974
Rumor has it
that "Big Daddy Paddy"

07:33.061 --> 07:36.325
has picked you and you alone
to run the enterprise,

07:37.021 --> 07:40.634
bypassing
your big brother, Sean.

07:40.721 --> 07:43.027
Not to mention the fact
that we've leaked

07:43.114 --> 07:45.639
how cooperative
you're being with us.

07:45.726 --> 07:47.423
That's bollocks.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.817
You think Sean
will believe that?

07:49.904 --> 07:51.296
You're fucking daft.

07:51.383 --> 07:53.168
I guess we'll see.

07:54.082 --> 07:55.779
Let's take him
to the Terminal building.

08:05.572 --> 08:06.747
Watch your step.

08:19.934 --> 08:22.937
Johnno. What's the craic?

08:23.024 --> 08:25.809
Jesus fucking Christ.
Fucking shit.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.071
All right.

08:27.158 --> 08:29.465
Sean. It's Johnno.

08:31.772 --> 08:33.774
Johnno, what's the story?

08:34.383 --> 08:36.777
Sean, the Feds grabbed Ryan.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.214
They're moving him now.

08:39.301 --> 08:40.520
Fuck.

08:42.304 --> 08:44.741
Maybe this is
our opportunity.

08:44.828 --> 08:46.177
Watch your head.

08:47.135 --> 08:48.092
Are you tooled up?

08:48.179 --> 08:50.007
Yeah.

08:50.094 --> 08:52.532
You stay with him,
you keep your eye on him, yeah?

08:52.619 --> 08:54.011
All right, good luck.

09:03.107 --> 09:04.239
What's going on?

09:05.588 --> 09:06.894
The FBI have Ryan.

09:06.981 --> 09:08.112
Christ.

09:08.199 --> 09:09.723
Do you wanna call your dad?

09:09.810 --> 09:12.464
No, I don't want
to call my fucking dad.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.119
Hey, lads, we have to go.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.295
Come on, Danny.

09:19.602 --> 09:21.386
Come on, move it,
for fuck's sake.

09:26.870 --> 09:30.352
It's not your first time
in cuffs, Quinn, relax.

09:30.439 --> 09:31.701
Fuck you.

09:35.357 --> 09:36.576
I'm just behind them.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.578
We're coming up
right behind you.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.405
Get ready to move in,
cut them off.

09:49.284 --> 09:50.851
What's he doing?

09:50.938 --> 09:52.069
Now.

09:52.809 --> 09:54.158
Veer left, veer left!

09:54.245 --> 09:56.030
Watch the fence,
watch the fence!

09:59.947 --> 10:01.949
This is for you,
you fucking asshole.

10:02.036 --> 10:03.341
Cut them off.

10:03.428 --> 10:04.691
Jesus, got to be quick.

10:08.042 --> 10:09.826
Jesus...

10:13.438 --> 10:14.744
It's a fucking ambush!

10:15.876 --> 10:18.530
We got bulletproof glass,
it's okay, it's okay.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.011
Stay down!

10:22.056 --> 10:23.840
Down! Down!

10:30.934 --> 10:32.109
Danny, cover!

10:33.458 --> 10:34.764
Fuck you, cunt.

10:36.287 --> 10:37.941
This is the FBI!
Drop your weapon!

10:40.465 --> 10:41.728
Fuck off!Drop your weapon!

10:41.815 --> 10:43.164
Get down!

10:55.350 --> 10:56.568
Sean...

11:05.099 --> 11:06.709
I got them.

11:14.412 --> 11:16.023
Shit!

11:16.110 --> 11:17.633
Fucking move. Johnno, Danny,
come on, let's go!

11:17.720 --> 11:19.635
Where's my phone? Wow.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.552
Get me directions
to the nearest hospital.

11:24.118 --> 11:28.426
Calculating. Mercy Hospital.
Please proceed to the route.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.473
Is that the birthday boy
I see?

11:31.560 --> 11:33.040
Not yet. Think fast!

11:33.127 --> 11:34.606
Ho!

11:34.694 --> 11:36.957
Rumor has it,
you made the under-12 team.

11:37.044 --> 11:38.262
I've been practicing.

11:38.349 --> 11:39.481
Hey, you two.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.918
Well, the hardest worker I know

11:42.005 --> 11:43.746
finally taking a night off.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.139
And for a soccer game.

11:45.226 --> 11:46.531
It's "football".

11:46.618 --> 11:48.098
A purist, I see.

11:49.230 --> 11:50.710
Thanks again for tonight.

11:50.797 --> 11:51.754
I owe you one.

11:51.841 --> 11:52.929
Not at all.

11:53.016 --> 11:54.801
Happy to cover.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.846
You all ready? Okay.

11:56.933 --> 11:58.021
Gotta sign out
and we're good to go.

11:58.108 --> 11:59.631
Okay.All right.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.459
Come on, let's-- whoa!

12:01.546 --> 12:02.939
Got ya!

12:10.338 --> 12:12.383
Help. Medics!

12:12.470 --> 12:14.777
FBI. We just got ambushed.

12:14.864 --> 12:17.345
My partner is shot
and so is our witness.

12:18.346 --> 12:20.000
Careful. Easy.Got him.

12:21.392 --> 12:23.177
Got him.

12:23.264 --> 12:25.092
Here, let me get
the cuffs off him. Here you go.

12:27.703 --> 12:28.965
Go, go, go, go, go.

12:29.052 --> 12:30.227
IV is Ready!

12:30.314 --> 12:31.576
Get them inside.

12:31.968 --> 12:33.665
Coming through,
coming through!

12:36.103 --> 12:37.452
Holy shit.

12:46.417 --> 12:47.636
Bobby, come here, please.

12:47.723 --> 12:49.159
What now?

12:50.595 --> 12:52.075
You guys, go. I've got this.

12:52.162 --> 12:53.642
Call Nurse Riley, please.

12:54.512 --> 12:55.644
What happened?

12:55.731 --> 12:57.559
I don't know, buddy.

12:57.646 --> 12:59.387
Maybe you should go help.
We're still early.

12:59.474 --> 13:00.867
We made birthday plans.

13:00.954 --> 13:02.172
What if they need you?

13:03.870 --> 13:06.002
Kindest heart I know,
you know that?

13:06.089 --> 13:08.309
Just like your dad.

13:08.396 --> 13:09.745
Can I go play in the tunnels?

13:09.832 --> 13:11.791
No. You just stay right here.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.227
I won't be long. Copy?

13:13.314 --> 13:15.098
Copy.Okay.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.201
Luck of the Irish.

13:31.288 --> 13:33.551
No luck in it
at all, gentlemen.

13:33.638 --> 13:38.469
It's just a magnificent talent
that the Lord blessed me with.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.341
Three in a row, Paddy.

13:40.428 --> 13:41.777
Gettin' dangerous.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.258
That was a hell of a shot,
wasn't it, huh?

13:44.345 --> 13:48.523
Now, that,
I can have a little of that, eh?

13:49.089 --> 13:50.264
Water of life.

13:50.351 --> 13:51.700
Yeah, the water of life.

13:53.745 --> 13:55.878
Mm, Jonesy.

13:55.965 --> 13:57.793
Jonesy, I know what you want.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.577
Here, look.

13:59.664 --> 14:01.579
Here, there, look at this.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.103
Here, here, here.

14:03.668 --> 14:06.933
Jonesy, oh, you're
an alcoholic doggy, Jonesy?

14:07.020 --> 14:09.152
You're an alcoholic,
but I love ya.

14:23.471 --> 14:24.776
Sean.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.126
Dad.

14:26.213 --> 14:27.867
Dad?

14:27.954 --> 14:30.695
You only call me "Dad"
when you're in trouble, son.

14:30.782 --> 14:32.001
You're not in trouble, are ya?

14:32.088 --> 14:34.221
We have a problem.

14:34.308 --> 14:35.657
Oh?

14:35.744 --> 14:37.702
The FBI
took Ryan into custody.

14:38.399 --> 14:41.924
They have all his files,
everything on the business.

14:42.011 --> 14:43.534
Christ.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.841
We tried to get him out.
Things got messy.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.364
Dad...

14:47.451 --> 14:50.454
Ryan got shot.

14:50.541 --> 14:52.413
What are you
fooling saying to me?

14:55.198 --> 14:56.417
Sean?

14:57.418 --> 14:59.942
Tell me Ryan is alive.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.771
He is.

15:02.858 --> 15:03.903
He better be.

15:05.556 --> 15:06.949
Where'd they take him?

15:08.081 --> 15:09.386
They've taken him to The Mercy.

15:12.085 --> 15:15.958
Don't make another move
until I get there.

15:17.525 --> 15:19.483
How many bullets?

15:19.570 --> 15:21.833
One in the neck.
Ruptured an artery
from what I can see.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.923
Second patient
has one in the left hip

15:24.010 --> 15:25.011
and one in the stomach.

15:25.098 --> 15:26.447
Wound is fairly large.

15:26.534 --> 15:27.622
Okay, they're both
bleeding out.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.973
What are you doing here?
You got a game to catch.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.583
You're understaffed.

15:32.670 --> 15:34.411
And I took orders from Bobby.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.283
Runs in the family, I see.

15:37.762 --> 15:40.461
All right, everyone,
let's prep OR 1.

15:40.548 --> 15:41.853
Let's get busy.

15:46.075 --> 15:47.642
He's stable.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.078
Okay, good.

15:49.165 --> 15:50.775
I think I got
the last bullet.

15:50.862 --> 15:52.081
What's his pressure?

15:52.168 --> 15:53.387
One thirty over 80.

15:53.474 --> 15:54.910
Come on, come on, come on.

15:54.997 --> 15:56.259
Easy does it.

15:59.088 --> 16:00.785
There you go.What is that?

16:00.872 --> 16:03.005
It might be
an exploding bullet.

16:03.092 --> 16:04.267
Be careful.

16:05.399 --> 16:07.183
Okay.

16:12.406 --> 16:13.363
Is everyone okay?

16:13.450 --> 16:14.538
I'm okay.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.627
Yes, Sir, ambushed.

16:16.714 --> 16:18.194
It was the Quinn Gang.

16:18.281 --> 16:19.543
They had to have known
we were coming.

16:19.630 --> 16:20.849
It was a complete shit show.

16:20.936 --> 16:23.112
Yeah, 1100, Sir.

16:23.199 --> 16:25.114
Approximately.
Under the Southbound overpass.

16:26.072 --> 16:30.250
I'm...I'm pretty sure our driver
took a fatal hit.

16:30.337 --> 16:33.688
Yep, okay, will do. All right.

16:34.210 --> 16:37.387
Excuse me. Yeah,
I'm Special Agent Ellis, FBI.

16:37.474 --> 16:38.693
Are you with the ER team?

16:38.780 --> 16:40.651
I'm Dr. Miller, yes.

16:40.738 --> 16:44.133
Hi. I'm the one that brought in
a couple of gunshot victims.

16:44.786 --> 16:46.135
Agent McBride,
he's the one with the gray hair.

16:46.222 --> 16:47.354
How's he doing?

16:47.441 --> 16:48.703
He's stable now.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.705
Took a shot
to the anterior jugular.

16:50.792 --> 16:53.621
Wow. I mean, he's going
to be all right, though, right?

16:53.708 --> 16:55.623
Yes.Okay, good.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.799
Oh, and what about
our asset, Ryan Quinn?

17:00.236 --> 17:01.672
Asset, huh?

17:02.195 --> 17:03.979
Hit pretty bad.

17:04.458 --> 17:07.809
Including an exploding bullet
wedged in his lower rib-cage.

17:07.896 --> 17:09.376
Exploded in our ER.

17:10.551 --> 17:11.595
Exploded?

17:11.682 --> 17:13.075
Jesus.

17:13.162 --> 17:15.686
You wanna tell me
what we're dealing with?

17:15.773 --> 17:18.733
I'm sorry, doc, it's not--

17:18.820 --> 17:20.343
It's not something
I can talk about.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.432
It's a small hospital,
Agent Ellis,

17:22.519 --> 17:25.131
we're not really equipped
to deal with illegal ammunition.

17:25.218 --> 17:27.133
Look, I'm sorry, doc.

17:27.220 --> 17:30.179
It's-- it's above my clearance
level to-- you know, to--

17:30.266 --> 17:33.182
You're a by-the-book
kinda guy, huh?

17:33.269 --> 17:34.792
I know the type.

17:34.879 --> 17:37.447
A type?
What's that supposed to mean?

17:38.709 --> 17:40.450
I know a rookie when I see one.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.279
Word of advice.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.238
Keep your head up.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.588
Clearance levels
don't stop bullets.

18:03.560 --> 18:04.692
Oh, fuck.

18:05.954 --> 18:07.390
What are you gonna tell him?

18:07.477 --> 18:09.131
Not gonna say anything.

18:09.218 --> 18:11.220
Ryan was shot in the cross fire.
It was an accident.

18:13.701 --> 18:15.181
All right, Mick.

18:19.272 --> 18:20.795
You should have
come to me, son.

18:21.535 --> 18:23.102
You should have come to me
as soon as Ryan was taken,

18:23.189 --> 18:24.146
and you didn't, did ya?

18:24.233 --> 18:26.409
I know, it's my fault.

18:26.496 --> 18:29.717
You know how many times
I've had to clean up your mess?

18:29.804 --> 18:32.023
My dog's shites
are less numerous.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.853
Put that weapon away!
Put that weapon away!

18:35.940 --> 18:40.336
What do you think this is,
Chicago 1920s?

18:40.423 --> 18:42.382
You're making
a spectacle of yourself.

18:46.037 --> 18:48.910
I never liked hospitals.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.520
Too many people die in them.
Let's go.

18:50.607 --> 18:51.956
You stay here.

18:52.043 --> 18:53.132
What are you gonna do?

18:53.654 --> 18:55.960
I'm going to see your brother.

18:56.047 --> 18:59.355
The rest of ya, do nothing.

18:59.442 --> 19:02.837
Do nothing
until I assess the situation.

19:05.927 --> 19:07.276
Your father means well.

19:07.363 --> 19:08.843
Yeah, I'm sure he does, yeah.

19:11.933 --> 19:13.413
Hey, you, Billy the Kid.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.110
Do you want a box
in the fucking mouth?

19:15.197 --> 19:17.112
Give me a fucking break.

19:17.199 --> 19:19.332
I'll give you a fucking break,
I'll break your fucking legs.

19:35.565 --> 19:37.393
Excuse me, sweetheart.

19:37.480 --> 19:40.091
I'm looking
for Ryan Quinn's room.

19:42.964 --> 19:45.096
Ryan Quinn.

19:46.924 --> 19:48.448
Oh, I'm sorry, Sir.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.667
That's been flagged
as a private ward.

19:50.754 --> 19:52.103
No visitors.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.627
No visitors?

19:53.714 --> 19:57.544
Well, I'm not a visitor,

19:57.631 --> 19:59.459
I'm his fucking father.

20:00.764 --> 20:03.419
Okay. I'm sorry, Mr. Quinn.

20:03.506 --> 20:05.769
There's a waiting room
around the corner

20:05.856 --> 20:06.988
and you're welcome to sit there.

20:07.075 --> 20:09.120
Oh, there's a waiting room.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.644
Yeah. I'm sure one
of the Trauma Doctors
will be out soon.

20:10.731 --> 20:12.167
Thank you,
around the corner.

20:12.254 --> 20:13.821
Thank you.

20:13.908 --> 20:15.170
Cunt.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.183
Hey.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.055
Think fast, son.

20:32.361 --> 20:35.538
Whoa-ho!
Another five years,

20:35.625 --> 20:38.585
I'll have to pay good money
just to watch ya.

20:38.672 --> 20:39.934
Thanks.

20:41.196 --> 20:43.329
Should I take
a quiet look around now?

20:45.505 --> 20:47.420
No, stay.
Stay close-- for now.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.860
You don't think
he's alive, do ya?

20:52.947 --> 20:54.296
No way he survived.

20:54.383 --> 20:56.167
We shot right at him.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.735
Fucking explosives
didn't work anyway.

20:59.388 --> 21:00.998
You know, I think Ryan
was put on this Earth

21:01.085 --> 21:02.739
just to fucking torment me.

21:23.238 --> 21:25.153
See you tomorrow, Dr. Miller.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.850
Okay.

21:30.158 --> 21:31.855
Excuse me.

21:31.942 --> 21:34.858
Have you seen a little boy
around about 11 years old?

21:34.945 --> 21:36.947
He's got a soccer ball with him?

21:37.034 --> 21:39.385
I think you might find him

21:39.472 --> 21:41.604
dribbling his ball
down at the end of this hallway.

21:41.691 --> 21:43.693
Thank you.

21:43.780 --> 21:46.522
You're a doctor, huh?

21:46.609 --> 21:48.742
I'm actually off-duty, Sir.

21:48.829 --> 21:51.571
Well, perhaps you can help me,
I can't seem to get any answers.

21:51.658 --> 21:54.574
I'm looking for my son,
Ryan Quinn.

21:54.661 --> 21:56.227
Your son?

21:58.447 --> 22:00.971
You're a very lucky man,
Mr. Quinn.

22:01.494 --> 22:03.496
We pulled two bullets
out of your boy.

22:04.366 --> 22:06.368
Two bullets?
Is he...

22:06.455 --> 22:08.675
He's heavily sedated
at the moment,

22:08.762 --> 22:10.981
but there doesn't seem to be
any permanent damage

22:11.068 --> 22:12.331
from what we can tell.

22:13.636 --> 22:15.551
That's wonderful news.

22:15.638 --> 22:18.206
You're an angel from God.
Can you take me to him?

22:18.293 --> 22:20.861
You'll have to clear that
with the authorities, Sir.

22:20.948 --> 22:22.471
Authorities?

22:22.558 --> 22:24.299
What happened?

22:24.386 --> 22:26.693
I'll make sure Dr. Terrence
comes to speak with you.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.434
Appreciate it.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.102
There you are.

22:45.189 --> 22:47.061
I thought I asked you to stay
in the waiting area?

22:47.148 --> 22:48.976
Sorry, I got bored.

22:49.063 --> 22:52.327
Are you ready for the
biggest hotdog money can buy?

22:52.414 --> 22:53.937
And ice-cream?

22:54.024 --> 22:55.809
Anything for my birthday boy.

22:55.896 --> 22:57.114
Let's go.

22:59.856 --> 23:01.510
That's some pretty nice kicks
you got.

23:01.597 --> 23:02.729
Thanks.Yeah.

23:05.862 --> 23:08.691
Wait. We got company.

23:10.911 --> 23:12.608
Afternoon, fellas.

23:12.695 --> 23:14.697
Hi. How's it going?Good, good.

23:14.784 --> 23:16.133
Y'all waiting for somebody?

23:16.220 --> 23:17.178
Yeah, shouldn't be too long.

23:17.265 --> 23:18.919
All right.

23:19.006 --> 23:20.224
You still gotta pay
for a parking pass, though.

23:20.311 --> 23:21.400
You a traffic cop?

23:21.487 --> 23:23.402
Hey, Johnny, cop on.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.142
Sorry, never mind him.

23:25.229 --> 23:27.231
He's just--
he's a bit nervous.

23:27.318 --> 23:29.103
His girlfriend's having
their first baby,
you know how it is.

23:29.190 --> 23:30.539
Right.

23:31.366 --> 23:32.759
Well, you still
gotta pay for parking.

23:32.846 --> 23:34.761
Not a bother.

23:34.848 --> 23:36.806
Take care. Bye.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.424
I don't like him
checking us out like that.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.122
Neither do I.

23:48.209 --> 23:51.168
Come on, let's make a move.

24:06.662 --> 24:08.534
We have some real sleazy types
out in the lot.

24:08.621 --> 24:11.275
I'm gonna call their plate in
to my guy.

24:11.362 --> 24:13.626
Always playing detective,
huh, Frank?

24:13.713 --> 24:15.410
Well, you know
my hunches, right?

24:16.803 --> 24:18.457
Hey, you.

24:18.544 --> 24:20.633
Put the phone down,
get up against the wall.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.025
Johnno.Drop it, fucker.

24:22.112 --> 24:23.418
Okay.

24:23.505 --> 24:25.551
I said, drop it!Okay, okay.

24:27.683 --> 24:29.076
Don't fucking push it.

24:31.208 --> 24:32.383
Oh, my God.

24:35.430 --> 24:36.692
Christ.

24:39.173 --> 24:40.566
Come on.

24:47.703 --> 24:49.488
What the fuck
are you morons doing?

24:49.575 --> 24:51.402
She was about to push
the panic button, Paddy.

24:53.361 --> 24:56.843
What part of do nothing
didn't you understand?

24:57.583 --> 24:59.193
All right,

24:59.280 --> 25:01.325
move all these people
to the waiting area.

25:01.412 --> 25:02.979
Lock it down.

25:03.066 --> 25:05.329
You, guard the entrance.
No one in or out.

25:05.416 --> 25:07.375
You, make sure
the back is secure.

25:07.462 --> 25:08.855
Get that dead woman
out of there

25:08.942 --> 25:10.160
and clean up that blood.

25:10.247 --> 25:12.293
You, come with me.

25:12.380 --> 25:13.424
Come on! Round them up.

25:13.512 --> 25:14.513
Paddy, please...

25:14.600 --> 25:15.862
Fucking idiot.

25:15.949 --> 25:17.428
You heard him,
fucking move!

25:17.516 --> 25:20.344
Boy, what the fuck
you looking at?

25:30.485 --> 25:31.747
Where are we going?

25:31.834 --> 25:33.053
Somewhere safe.

25:33.140 --> 25:34.228
Come on.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.710
Come in here.
Come in here.

25:37.797 --> 25:38.885
All right,

25:38.972 --> 25:39.973
I need you to wait in here.

25:40.060 --> 25:41.757
Mom, no.

25:41.844 --> 25:44.499
Come on, Bobby, I need you
to be brave now, okay?

25:44.586 --> 25:45.848
This is the safest spot.

25:45.935 --> 25:47.458
In there?

25:47.546 --> 25:49.722
Come on, honey,
you've been brave before.

25:50.505 --> 25:52.376
Do you remember
when we were camping

25:52.463 --> 25:53.900
and I was scared of that snake?

25:53.987 --> 25:57.164
You wound up
the biggest, hardest kick,

25:57.251 --> 25:59.122
you didn't even bat an eye
before kicking it away.

25:59.209 --> 26:00.210
Do you remember that?

26:00.297 --> 26:02.430
Mom, I heard a gunshot.

26:02.517 --> 26:04.214
I know what they sound like.

26:05.346 --> 26:09.524
Listen, your mom's been
doing this a long time.

26:09.611 --> 26:12.048
I am not going to let
anything happen to you.

26:15.182 --> 26:17.488
Stay in here, stay quiet,

26:17.576 --> 26:19.142
and we'll get
out of this together.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.232
Dad'll watch over you.

26:23.669 --> 26:25.105
That's my man.

26:26.062 --> 26:27.455
Stay quiet.

26:27.542 --> 26:28.978
I won't be long, okay?

26:30.371 --> 26:31.502
Love you.

26:31.590 --> 26:32.982
I love you, too.

26:40.337 --> 26:41.861
Please, please,
it was an accident.

26:41.948 --> 26:43.297
I didn't mean to.

26:43.384 --> 26:44.472
Please, please.Shut the fuck up.

26:44.559 --> 26:45.995
Paddy, please...

26:46.082 --> 26:51.174
Liam. Grab him.

26:51.261 --> 26:54.264
I don't know what ears are for
if you don't use them.

26:55.048 --> 26:56.440
You want to play with your gun?

26:57.659 --> 26:59.269
Here's the consequence.

27:14.023 --> 27:16.069
Ah, fuck!

27:16.156 --> 27:19.420
Next time
use the other ear to listen.

27:19.507 --> 27:22.423
Or I'll cut that one off, too!

27:22.510 --> 27:23.990
You hear me now?

27:30.257 --> 27:31.519
Good man, Paddy.

27:36.089 --> 27:37.394
Here, sit.

27:37.481 --> 27:39.222
Sit. Here, have a seat.
Sit down.

27:40.049 --> 27:41.355
Over here.

27:41.442 --> 27:43.836
Clean him up.
You, clean him up.

27:43.923 --> 27:45.489
Clean him up.

27:46.273 --> 27:47.578
Quickly.

27:49.537 --> 27:51.582
Good afternoon, folks.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.889
Don't mind him.

27:53.976 --> 27:57.806
Now, I'm going to speak
very slowly and clearly
for everyone,

27:57.893 --> 27:59.982
because people say sometimes

28:00.069 --> 28:02.028
that it might be hard
to understand me

28:02.115 --> 28:03.246
with my Irish accent.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.858
So, listen up carefully,

28:05.945 --> 28:08.121
so there's
no misunderstandings...

28:08.948 --> 28:10.645
and no one gets hurt, see?

28:12.995 --> 28:15.128
Now, can anyone
please tell me

28:15.606 --> 28:18.609
where my son, Ryan Quinn,
is being kept?

28:19.698 --> 28:21.003
You tell me,

28:21.090 --> 28:24.398
we will get him,
and be on our merry way.

28:24.485 --> 28:25.965
Simple as that.

28:28.489 --> 28:29.795
Anyone?

28:30.926 --> 28:32.058
I can.

28:33.668 --> 28:36.410
I worked on him.
I know where he is.

28:36.497 --> 28:37.890
Stand up.

28:39.979 --> 28:42.808
Thank you, thank you, kind Sir.

28:43.634 --> 28:45.506
You must be a father, huh?

28:47.595 --> 28:48.727
Speak up.

28:49.858 --> 28:51.294
I have a daughter.

28:51.381 --> 28:52.513
Beautiful.

28:52.600 --> 28:53.688
How old?

28:53.775 --> 28:55.081
Almost 14.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.823
Oh, a teenager.

28:57.910 --> 28:59.476
Wonderful.

28:59.563 --> 29:01.957
So you understand
why I need to find my son.

29:02.566 --> 29:03.916
Yes.

29:08.964 --> 29:11.445
I just don't want anyone
unnecessarily hurt.

29:14.448 --> 29:16.667
I don't want
to see anyone hurt.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.324
Take me to him.

29:25.198 --> 29:26.765
Sean.Yeah.

29:30.769 --> 29:34.207
No one move, no one talk.

29:37.558 --> 29:38.820
Danny.

29:39.473 --> 29:41.257
Christ, you okay?

29:43.259 --> 29:44.695
Jesus.

30:15.030 --> 30:16.553
Where is he?

30:16.640 --> 30:18.120
He was here.

30:21.776 --> 30:23.343
I don't see him.

30:27.651 --> 30:30.872
I assure you, he was here,
with an FBI agent.

30:30.959 --> 30:32.526
What agent?

30:33.614 --> 30:36.617
Ellis. Agent Ellis.

30:36.704 --> 30:38.227
They all came in together.

30:42.971 --> 30:45.495
He's telling the truth.

30:45.582 --> 30:47.497
How the fuck do you know?

30:47.584 --> 30:49.848
Because I know.

30:51.414 --> 30:52.633
Do ya?

31:07.517 --> 31:09.171
What ya doing?

31:09.258 --> 31:11.652
That's the little prick
that nicked Ryan.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.403
What the hell, Sean?

31:23.490 --> 31:24.839
What did you do?

31:25.884 --> 31:28.799
He's responsible
for my little brother
being in here.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.801
You're both responsible.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.803
Will you please
stop killing people?

31:33.979 --> 31:36.677
Fuck him.
He was dead anyway.

31:43.075 --> 31:44.424
Fuck.

31:46.774 --> 31:48.254
You tried.

31:48.341 --> 31:49.646
Let's go.

31:51.039 --> 31:55.348
Liam, the Feds moved Ryan.

31:55.435 --> 31:57.002
Send the boys out to find him.

31:57.089 --> 31:58.481
You got it, Paddy.

31:59.526 --> 32:02.703
Search every floor,
every fucking room.

32:02.790 --> 32:04.139
Come on,
let's find Ryan.

32:04.226 --> 32:05.575
Come on, then!

32:06.272 --> 32:08.230
Watch the bag, lad.

32:08.317 --> 32:09.884
Good man.

32:34.648 --> 32:36.041
What the fuck? Jesus Christ.

32:36.128 --> 32:38.957
Jesus Christ, they killed him.

34:07.088 --> 34:08.872
For Christ's sake.

34:09.873 --> 34:11.353
You could've
gotten yourself shot.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.181
You see anything?

34:13.268 --> 34:14.574
No.

34:15.792 --> 34:17.359
Still can't believe
Paddy did that.

34:17.446 --> 34:20.884
Oi, keep your mouth shut.

34:20.971 --> 34:22.538
Danny's a fucking idiot.

34:22.625 --> 34:24.236
Takes too much after Sean.

34:30.198 --> 34:32.766
Easy.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.507
That's my fucking cousin.

34:35.377 --> 34:37.162
We're all family at this point.

34:37.771 --> 34:41.209
You want to do well by Danny?
By yourself?

34:41.296 --> 34:43.559
You fucking
better listen to Paddy.

34:43.646 --> 34:45.039
Understood?

35:02.665 --> 35:04.145
Jesus, Frank.

35:04.232 --> 35:05.538
They shot Shannon.

35:06.539 --> 35:07.844
Oh, my God.

35:07.931 --> 35:09.411
I gotta show you something.

35:21.554 --> 35:23.295
Huh?

35:23.382 --> 35:24.861
Those are the hostages.

35:24.948 --> 35:26.341
Huh.

35:26.428 --> 35:27.603
Agent Ellis.

35:27.690 --> 35:28.909
Where is that?

35:28.996 --> 35:30.171
Third-floor storage area.

35:30.258 --> 35:31.520
Been abandoned for decades.

35:31.607 --> 35:33.348
Cut the feed to the monitors.

35:33.435 --> 35:35.437
The monitors? Why?

35:35.524 --> 35:37.526
I don't need them
knowing where I am.

35:37.613 --> 35:39.180
Okay.

35:54.674 --> 35:57.981
Holy shit. Some doctor.

35:59.026 --> 36:01.028
Skills from a past life.

36:01.115 --> 36:02.725
What, as Wonder Woman?

36:02.812 --> 36:04.553
Tie him up.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.164
And cut those wires.

36:06.251 --> 36:07.687
Yeah, I'm on it.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.487
Wait, wait.

36:33.756 --> 36:35.193
Don't shoot!

36:35.976 --> 36:38.587
A Clown. Get up.

36:39.458 --> 36:41.938
Come with me. Come with me.

36:43.679 --> 36:47.683
Move. Come on now.
Move. Move.

36:51.339 --> 36:54.299
Clown--
You used to love clowns.

36:54.386 --> 36:55.778
Still do.

36:55.865 --> 36:57.824
That's why I have
five of them working for me.

36:59.565 --> 37:02.611
Everybody's cool and calm.
Good job.

37:04.396 --> 37:06.093
Hello, big ears.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.055
Now, listen up.

37:12.142 --> 37:15.015
It's been a long time
since I've taken a life,

37:15.102 --> 37:16.582
I prefer to leave it to God
these days,

37:16.669 --> 37:18.410
but I am getting
fucking desperate.

37:18.497 --> 37:20.629
I need to find my son.

37:20.716 --> 37:23.066
I need someone to come with me

37:23.153 --> 37:24.677
who knows the ins and outs

37:24.764 --> 37:26.635
of the architecture
of this building.

37:28.594 --> 37:30.160
Nobody?

37:31.771 --> 37:32.946
What the?

37:33.033 --> 37:34.600
Jesus fucking wept.

37:42.956 --> 37:44.958
Let's go! Move, move!

38:00.016 --> 38:03.411
This is Agent Duncan Jones
of the FBI.

38:03.498 --> 38:06.936
I would like to speak
to whomever is in charge here.

38:07.633 --> 38:09.939
You, female nurse,
stand up, come with me.

38:10.026 --> 38:11.289
Now.

38:12.377 --> 38:14.204
Sean?

38:14.292 --> 38:16.206
I'm going to talk
to the cops, Paddy.

38:16.990 --> 38:18.426
Unless you want
to show your face.

38:54.854 --> 38:56.421
The fuck?

39:21.837 --> 39:23.230
Ellis?

39:26.233 --> 39:27.887
Ellis, it's Dr. Miller.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.672
Agent Ellis?

39:30.759 --> 39:32.892
Psst. In here.

39:38.027 --> 39:40.421
Ellis.Yeah, in here.

39:40.508 --> 39:42.118
What are you doing?

39:42.205 --> 39:44.077
I had to move him,
they were going to kill him.

39:44.164 --> 39:46.296
They killed McBride.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.950
Yeah.I'm sorry.

39:48.037 --> 39:50.518
They just unplugged
his life support,

39:50.605 --> 39:51.911
just ripped it right off of him.

39:51.998 --> 39:53.478
I was fine with my desk job.

39:53.565 --> 39:55.436
You know,
they said you want action, huh?

39:55.523 --> 39:57.177
You want to make a difference,

39:57.264 --> 39:58.657
go into the field
with an easy first assignment.

39:58.744 --> 39:59.919
Easy, my ass!

40:00.006 --> 40:01.790
Ellis...My partner's dead!

40:01.877 --> 40:03.401
I should have been there,
I should have done something.

40:03.488 --> 40:05.403
Agent Ellis, I need you
to get it together.

40:05.490 --> 40:07.535
I'm sorry about your partner,

40:07.622 --> 40:09.363
but right now,
they are searching for Ryan,

40:09.450 --> 40:12.192
and they are not going to stop
until they find him.

40:12.279 --> 40:15.064
What--
what happened?

40:15.151 --> 40:16.892
The meds are wearing off.

40:16.979 --> 40:18.198
I'm gonna find him something.

40:18.285 --> 40:20.026
Just... stay here.

40:25.118 --> 40:27.381
Fucking move.

40:27.468 --> 40:29.296
Now, I'm going to tell you
one last time,

40:29.383 --> 40:31.211
you're going to do
exactly as I tell you to do,

40:31.298 --> 40:32.560
or I'm going to put a bullet
in your fucking head.

40:32.647 --> 40:34.170
Open it.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.916
Hey, you! Can you hear me?

40:41.003 --> 40:43.963
I want you to listen
very carefully!

40:44.050 --> 40:47.880
If any of you make a move
towards this building,

40:47.967 --> 40:50.273
I will ice pick the spines

40:50.360 --> 40:52.406
of every fucking hostage
in here!

40:52.493 --> 40:54.843
Do you understand me?

40:55.322 --> 40:56.845
I understand.

40:56.932 --> 40:59.457
Nobody has to die, okay?

41:00.066 --> 41:01.850
So let's work together here.

41:02.721 --> 41:04.462
You just tell me
what you want...

41:04.549 --> 41:06.855
and we'll do our best to comply.

41:07.465 --> 41:11.077
I want your men
to back the fuck up!

41:11.164 --> 41:15.037
Me and my family want
to leave here in one piece!

41:15.124 --> 41:18.911
How we leave everyone else
is entirely up to you!

41:20.478 --> 41:22.044
We'll be in touch.

41:26.484 --> 41:29.965
Sir, that's Sean Quinn.
Patrick Quinn's eldest son.

41:30.052 --> 41:33.360
I know who the fuck that is.

41:33.447 --> 41:34.796
Goddammit.

41:51.378 --> 41:52.945
You think you're really
fucking smart, don't you?

41:59.647 --> 42:00.866
Don't move.

42:00.953 --> 42:02.520
Drop it. Now!

42:06.219 --> 42:09.309
You come to shoot?
Shoot. Don't talk.

42:14.140 --> 42:15.533
Thanks for the advice.

42:18.448 --> 42:19.711
You okay?

42:19.798 --> 42:21.364
Yeah, it's just a graze.

42:23.279 --> 42:24.716
That was my da's man.

42:24.803 --> 42:26.456
What the fuck did you just do?

42:27.457 --> 42:29.938
Johnno, what is it?

42:30.025 --> 42:31.331
I'll check it out, Boss.

42:31.418 --> 42:32.767
Good man.

42:34.203 --> 42:36.292
We gotta move.

42:36.379 --> 42:37.903
I think I'm bleeding.

42:45.171 --> 42:47.869
"Cut the wires," she says.
"It'll be easy," she says.

42:47.956 --> 42:50.393
I don't know
which wires to cut.

42:50.480 --> 42:52.700
Yipee-ky-yay.

42:58.358 --> 42:59.577
Ah, shit.

43:02.014 --> 43:05.060
Danny, see what that is.

43:05.147 --> 43:06.453
Paddy, I...

43:07.585 --> 43:09.282
I don't feel so good.

43:09.369 --> 43:10.849
It's an ear.

43:10.936 --> 43:13.416
You got the rest of your body.
Move it.

43:18.596 --> 43:19.945
Go, go, go!

43:24.297 --> 43:25.951
Hey, asshole!

43:26.038 --> 43:28.214
That's no way
to start a negotiation!

43:28.301 --> 43:31.304
We're just
following protocol, Sean.

43:32.435 --> 43:34.524
Now, help us out here.

43:34.612 --> 43:36.614
Why don't you
just let the lady go?

43:36.701 --> 43:39.747
Fuck you
and fuck your protocol!

43:40.139 --> 43:41.880
I have enough C4 in here

43:41.967 --> 43:44.143
to blow this whole
fucking place to hell!

43:44.230 --> 43:46.711
Do not think I will not use it!

43:46.798 --> 43:50.105
I won't hesitate,
not for a fucking second.

43:50.192 --> 43:51.324
I hear you.

43:51.411 --> 43:52.804
Now, listen to me.

43:52.891 --> 43:55.676
No one has to die, okay?

43:58.766 --> 43:59.985
Fuck!

44:03.292 --> 44:05.425
Gimme an update.

44:05.512 --> 44:08.036
Just doin' the rounds, Sean.

44:08.123 --> 44:09.908
Still haven't seen anyone.

44:09.995 --> 44:11.561
You all right, Danny?

44:11.649 --> 44:13.825
All right?

44:13.912 --> 44:16.697
Your dad just cut
my fucking ear off.

44:17.829 --> 44:19.482
Are you listening now?

44:20.440 --> 44:22.224
That's what happens

44:22.311 --> 44:25.053
to little boys who don't do
what they're fucking told.

44:31.103 --> 44:32.626
Children, huh?

44:49.338 --> 44:51.036
We meet again.

44:51.123 --> 44:52.211
I know this looks bad,

44:52.298 --> 44:54.039
but I was just, you know...

44:54.604 --> 44:55.736
I'll shut up.

44:55.823 --> 44:56.998
You're gonna come with me.

44:57.085 --> 44:58.434
I'm going to come with you.

45:06.007 --> 45:07.313
What do we have here?

45:09.271 --> 45:11.012
The Quinns have men
at all the exits.

45:11.099 --> 45:12.448
Ambulance Bay, as well.

45:12.535 --> 45:13.841
All guarded.

45:18.019 --> 45:19.455
Fuck me.

45:20.456 --> 45:21.849
Take a deep breath.
It's going to sting.

45:21.936 --> 45:23.242
Breathe in.

45:23.329 --> 45:25.331
Good.
There you go.

45:25.418 --> 45:27.028
Ah, fuck.

45:27.115 --> 45:30.640
So, uh, where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

45:33.295 --> 45:35.297
Served two tours
in Afghanistan.

45:36.646 --> 45:38.083
Saw more
than anyone should.

45:39.214 --> 45:41.086
Afghanistan, huh?

45:41.173 --> 45:42.740
Well, thank you
for your service.

45:45.917 --> 45:47.396
It'll freeze up
in a few minutes.

45:47.483 --> 45:49.790
You're lucky to be alive.

45:49.877 --> 45:51.923
Yeah, tell that
to my brother.

45:52.010 --> 45:53.315
He's the one who shot me.

45:53.402 --> 45:55.404
Your brother?

45:55.491 --> 45:56.884
Yeah, welcome
to the Quinn family.

45:57.450 --> 45:59.408
What, you've been an FBI agent
for two weeks now

45:59.495 --> 46:00.932
and you know all about
me and my family?

46:04.370 --> 46:07.852
My dad wants me to take over
the family business,

46:07.939 --> 46:09.331
Sean's fucking livid.

46:10.855 --> 46:12.117
So he shot you?

46:12.204 --> 46:14.772
My brother's
a fucking loonie.

46:14.859 --> 46:17.035
I was never gonna
take over without him.

46:17.122 --> 46:19.689
Sean's smart. I need him.

46:19.777 --> 46:21.996
Yeah. Well, it's too bad,

46:22.083 --> 46:23.955
because he's going to spend
the rest of his fucking life
in prison

46:24.042 --> 46:26.653
for murdering Federal Agents,
along with your old man,

46:26.740 --> 46:28.046
who's been aiding and abetting
his every move.

46:28.133 --> 46:29.395
My old man
has nothing to do with it.

46:30.048 --> 46:32.615
This is Sean's mess,
and if he was here--

46:32.702 --> 46:33.878
If he was here?

46:33.965 --> 46:35.314
What the fuck
do you think this is?

46:35.401 --> 46:36.881
He's here looking for you,

46:36.968 --> 46:38.665
along with his gang
of fucking henchmen.

46:38.752 --> 46:40.449
Then you need
to let me talk to him.

46:40.536 --> 46:43.496
The only way out of this
is to get me to my dad.

46:43.583 --> 46:45.367
You don't think
he'll come looking for Mick?

46:45.454 --> 46:46.586
The man she just killed?

46:46.673 --> 46:48.153
It was self-defense,

46:48.240 --> 46:49.589
I had to shoot him,
he was coming at me.

46:49.676 --> 46:50.982
I know.

46:51.069 --> 46:52.592
I saw that.

46:52.679 --> 46:54.289
But Sean's only gonna
use this against us.

46:54.376 --> 46:56.074
Oh, my God.

46:56.161 --> 46:57.597
You know what?
Listen to me carefully here.

46:57.684 --> 46:58.903
There's no way in hell
I'm letting you near them.

46:58.990 --> 47:00.121
You understand that?

47:00.208 --> 47:02.123
There's no fucking way.

47:02.210 --> 47:03.516
Then they will torture and kill
everyone in this hospital

47:03.603 --> 47:06.606
without remorse
until they find me.

47:06.693 --> 47:07.999
On that I give you my word.

47:21.969 --> 47:23.623
All right,
what am I looking at?

47:23.710 --> 47:26.582
Closed-circuit video feed
from inside the hospital.

47:27.192 --> 47:28.454
That's Agent Ellis.

47:28.541 --> 47:30.021
And that's Ryan Quinn, Sir.

47:31.196 --> 47:33.807
Wait. Who is she?

47:36.941 --> 47:38.812
Move. Move.

47:38.899 --> 47:40.727
Sean?Johnno.

47:40.814 --> 47:43.686
Remember this prick?

47:43.773 --> 47:46.602
Someone also took out
one of Paddy's guys--

47:46.689 --> 47:48.039
and I can't get ahold of Mick.

47:48.126 --> 47:50.302
Well, I didn't do anything,
I swear.

47:51.738 --> 47:53.218
Stand over by the wall.

48:03.706 --> 48:05.012
Are you a Fed?

48:10.757 --> 48:12.367
I'm gonna ask you...

48:12.454 --> 48:14.630
once.

48:14.717 --> 48:16.023
Where's my brother?

48:16.110 --> 48:19.157
I don't know, okay,
I promise.

48:21.072 --> 48:22.334
I also found these.

48:24.118 --> 48:25.946
Maps of the hospital.

48:30.211 --> 48:31.647
Keep this to yourself.

48:32.083 --> 48:33.432
All right, Boss.

48:37.218 --> 48:38.567
What the fuck's the plan?

48:39.655 --> 48:42.267
Take the back stairs
down to the boiler room.

48:42.354 --> 48:43.833
If his brother's
coming after him,

48:43.921 --> 48:45.139
it's the safest place to be.

48:45.226 --> 48:46.662
Hang onto this.

48:49.013 --> 48:50.362
What are you gonna do?

48:52.581 --> 48:54.061
What I swore I wouldn't.

48:56.281 --> 48:57.891
What you got for me, Tim?

49:00.111 --> 49:01.808
Captain Michelle Miller.

49:01.895 --> 49:04.202
E.O.D.S.
before becoming a Field Surgeon.

49:04.289 --> 49:06.813
Purple Heart.
Three-time Gold Star.

49:06.900 --> 49:10.164
First tour in Afghanistan,
she led a team
in Operation Nasrat,

49:10.251 --> 49:12.558
winning a Silver Star.

49:12.645 --> 49:14.647
Her second tour,
she trained the Afghan Forces
in hand-to-hand combat,

49:14.734 --> 49:17.215
before providing countermeasures
at the Bagram Air Base attack.

49:19.521 --> 49:21.784
She was there during
an insurgent attack in Kandahar,

49:21.871 --> 49:23.308
where her husband...

49:23.395 --> 49:24.918
late husband...

49:25.005 --> 49:26.485
Jeffrey Miller,

49:26.572 --> 49:28.617
an explosive ordnance
disposal specialist,

49:28.704 --> 49:30.837
was killed
on his third tour of duty.

49:31.794 --> 49:33.405
She survived the attack,
herself.

49:37.278 --> 49:39.106
Jesus.

49:40.455 --> 49:42.196
Yeah. That's her.

49:42.283 --> 49:43.981
Looks like we've got
some help on the inside.

49:44.633 --> 49:46.331
Ma'am,
we've got activity on the roof.

50:08.875 --> 50:11.399
Let's do everything we can
to help that soldier.

50:11.486 --> 50:12.835
Yes, Sir.

50:37.251 --> 50:38.687
Move.

50:38.774 --> 50:40.472
Sit him down there, Johnno.

50:40.559 --> 50:41.516
On the fucking ground.
You know how it is.

50:41.603 --> 50:43.605
Don't fuckin' look at me...

50:44.780 --> 50:46.869
Any sign of him, Da?

50:48.915 --> 50:50.047
What the...

50:51.961 --> 50:53.137
Fuck.

50:54.442 --> 50:55.835
Sean.

50:57.619 --> 50:58.794
Danny, what's the story?

50:58.881 --> 51:00.666
Mick's been shot.

51:00.753 --> 51:02.015
He's dead.

51:07.194 --> 51:09.196
There's another Fed
in this building.

51:09.892 --> 51:13.418
We have to find him
and we have to kill him.

51:13.505 --> 51:14.854
All right?

51:15.463 --> 51:17.509
You, go help Danny.

51:17.596 --> 51:18.597
Hurry.

51:18.684 --> 51:20.294
Shut the fucking alarm off.

51:20.381 --> 51:21.426
You heard him.

51:23.428 --> 51:25.169
What the fuck?

51:25.256 --> 51:26.953
What the fuck are you gonna do?

51:27.040 --> 51:28.433
We don't have a choice,
let's go.

51:28.520 --> 51:30.609
Jesus! Fuck!

51:51.064 --> 51:52.370
Ah!

52:02.771 --> 52:04.817
Funny place
for a lad to be hiding.

52:07.080 --> 52:08.168
Who's this?

52:12.259 --> 52:14.479
Time to say hello
to Uncle Paddy.

52:47.338 --> 52:48.382
Shit.

52:48.469 --> 52:50.776
Oh, dammit. Dammit.

52:55.041 --> 52:56.303
Fuck.

52:57.826 --> 52:59.306
Hey, Paddy.

52:59.393 --> 53:00.699
Look what I found!

53:00.786 --> 53:02.396
Oh, the footballer.

53:04.311 --> 53:05.312
Your mother
was looking for you.

53:05.399 --> 53:06.879
Did she find you?

53:08.141 --> 53:09.838
Let him go.
Danny.

53:11.840 --> 53:13.146
Did you find her, son?

53:13.233 --> 53:14.452
No, sir.

53:14.974 --> 53:16.541
I also found these, Paddy.

53:16.628 --> 53:19.108
You might want to take
a look for yourself.

53:19.196 --> 53:20.893
Oh, you done good, Danny.

53:20.980 --> 53:22.503
You done good, huh?

53:23.374 --> 53:25.463
This is a fine picture.
Look at this picture.

53:25.550 --> 53:27.378
Is that the family picture, huh?

53:27.465 --> 53:28.901
Yes, Sir.

53:28.988 --> 53:30.207
That's your family picture.

53:30.294 --> 53:32.557
And your father...

53:32.644 --> 53:34.776
your dad's in the military, huh?

53:34.863 --> 53:36.213
He was.

53:37.866 --> 53:39.216
He was.

53:40.391 --> 53:41.783
What's he doing now?

53:48.225 --> 53:50.879
Paging Dr. Miller.

53:50.966 --> 53:52.533
Dr. Michelle Miller.

53:53.273 --> 53:55.406
I assume you can hear me,
Dr. Miller,

53:55.493 --> 53:57.843
or should I say Captain Miller?

53:57.930 --> 53:59.105
Captain Miller.

53:59.932 --> 54:01.542
Small world, isn't it?

54:02.064 --> 54:06.547
Seems like not too long ago,
we met in the waiting area,

54:06.634 --> 54:09.202
just two parents
looking for their kids.

54:11.030 --> 54:12.945
I understand that you...

54:14.207 --> 54:18.124
you've had a couple
of impressive careers now.

54:19.821 --> 54:21.997
It's a shame
about your husband,

54:22.084 --> 54:24.173
Lieutenant Jeffrey Miller.

54:25.392 --> 54:29.266
Bobby tells me
that he was quite the soldier.

54:29.353 --> 54:30.919
Quite the soldier.

54:31.006 --> 54:35.489
Now, our family isn't one
for idle threats,

54:36.142 --> 54:38.100
but I can assure you,

54:38.187 --> 54:41.582
Captain Miller,
that this can all go away.

54:41.669 --> 54:43.280
Wouldn't you like that, Bobby?

54:44.019 --> 54:45.630
Mom...

54:45.717 --> 54:46.892
all he wants is his son,

54:46.979 --> 54:48.241
Ryan.

54:48.894 --> 54:50.983
Bobby, mom's right here, okay?

54:51.070 --> 54:52.811
Everything's going to be okay.

54:53.377 --> 54:54.987
Your boy
has nothing to worry about.

54:55.074 --> 54:56.858
He's in good hands.

54:56.945 --> 54:59.339
Of course, it's all contingent
on how my boy is doing.

55:00.775 --> 55:03.561
In fact
I'd like to speak to him.

55:04.649 --> 55:05.824
Let me hear his voice.

55:07.478 --> 55:10.394
He's not here.

55:10.481 --> 55:12.134
But you know
where he is, don't ya?

55:12.221 --> 55:13.440
I do.

55:13.527 --> 55:15.050
Good.

55:15.137 --> 55:17.009
Can I assume he's alive?

55:17.096 --> 55:19.968
He's alive. I promise you,
he's alive.

55:20.055 --> 55:21.753
Oh, that's very, very good news.

55:21.840 --> 55:23.407
We have to go to plan B.

55:23.494 --> 55:25.496
Grab the bag.

55:25.583 --> 55:27.280
Danny.

55:27.367 --> 55:31.458
Now, I don't want this
to go on any longer than you.

55:31.545 --> 55:33.765
So, as good parents,

55:33.852 --> 55:37.246
let's both get our children
back home safely.

55:37.334 --> 55:38.378
Wouldn't you like that?

55:39.336 --> 55:40.641
Yes.

55:42.295 --> 55:45.603
You bring me my boy,

55:45.690 --> 55:48.257
and Bobby will be
right back with you.

55:48.823 --> 55:50.303
That's it.

55:53.611 --> 55:54.612
You did good.

55:54.699 --> 55:55.874
Fuck.

56:02.533 --> 56:03.969

56:21.987 --> 56:23.815

to do this, you know.

56:24.555 --> 56:26.513
Nothin' gonna
happen to you, doctor.

56:27.471 --> 56:29.168
You don't have to worry.

56:30.212 --> 56:34.260
I need someone level-headed

56:34.347 --> 56:36.262

Open it.

57:37.541 --> 57:39.368
Don't shoot!

57:45.505 --> 57:47.333
Dr. Miller.

57:47.899 --> 57:49.640
I hate to interrupt
your heroics,

57:50.771 --> 57:52.599
but your friend
has a message for you...

57:53.687 --> 57:55.428
in the parking lot.

58:01.782 --> 58:02.827
Are you hurt?

58:02.914 --> 58:05.220
No, I'm okay.

58:05.307 --> 58:07.832
But there are explosives
attached to my body.

58:08.310 --> 58:09.877
Good God.

58:09.964 --> 58:11.226
They sent me out
with a message.

58:11.313 --> 58:12.793
What do they want?

58:12.880 --> 58:14.621
And blast and fire...

58:14.708 --> 58:16.057
They're planning
to execute hostages

58:16.144 --> 58:18.103
every 15 minutes
until you allow them out.

58:18.190 --> 58:19.452
Now, I've seen
this type before.

58:19.539 --> 58:20.584
God forgive me.

58:20.671 --> 58:22.586
You need to act now

58:22.673 --> 58:23.717
and get these sons of bitches
before they hurt anyone else--

58:37.905 --> 58:39.472
What was that?

58:41.561 --> 58:43.868
What the fuck was that?

58:43.955 --> 58:45.260
That was my brother.

58:51.528 --> 58:52.833
Jesus.

58:52.920 --> 58:54.487
You good, Cruz?Yeah, I'm good.

58:55.619 --> 58:57.534
Enough of this shit.

58:57.621 --> 58:59.840
The last thing we need
are dozens of dead hostages.

59:00.624 --> 59:02.887
Alert the SWAT team,
get them into position now.

59:02.974 --> 59:04.366
Yes, Sir.

59:06.020 --> 59:07.587
Motherfuckers.

59:07.674 --> 59:10.024
Here. I'll give that to you.

59:14.246 --> 59:15.552
In the name of Jesus.

59:17.249 --> 59:19.338
What the fucking hell
did you do?

59:19.425 --> 59:20.948
Hey, what the fuck's
going on with you?

59:21.035 --> 59:22.689
I had a fucking agreement!

59:23.255 --> 59:24.648
You've jeopardized
every fucking thing--

59:24.735 --> 59:26.214
She killed Mick.

59:27.433 --> 59:29.174
What the fuck
did you think, Paddy,

59:29.261 --> 59:31.263
that she was just
gonna hand Ryan back?

59:31.350 --> 59:32.917
She's working for the Feds.

59:34.875 --> 59:36.137
Little Sean.

59:36.224 --> 59:38.487
Ah, fuck off. Fuck off!

59:39.619 --> 59:41.926
What happened to you?

59:42.013 --> 59:43.492
I favored you as a child,

59:44.624 --> 59:47.975
I favored you
and your little wild ways,

59:48.062 --> 59:49.673
I saw myself in you.

59:49.760 --> 59:52.240
The only fucking person
you ever thought about

59:52.327 --> 59:54.286
was Paddy "Big Boy" Quinn.

59:54.373 --> 59:57.724
I was working for the family
the only way I know how.

59:57.811 --> 01:00:00.466
I was fighting
every fucking day with my hands

01:00:00.553 --> 01:00:03.469
to provide you
with a better life.

01:00:03.556 --> 01:00:06.559
Come here,
my life was fucking grand
back in Limerick, thanks.

01:00:06.646 --> 01:00:09.040
You were headed for trouble,
and I saw it.

01:00:09.127 --> 01:00:11.608
I had to pull you away
from those terrorist boys.

01:00:11.695 --> 01:00:13.218
Sean,

01:00:13.305 --> 01:00:16.047
you coulda started over
when we come here.

01:00:16.134 --> 01:00:17.526
What, like Ryan?

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:18.571
Like Ryan.

01:00:18.658 --> 01:00:20.704
Yes, like Ryan.

01:00:20.791 --> 01:00:23.271
Well, I'm sorry, Paddy,
I don't have the fucking--

01:00:23.358 --> 01:00:25.186
Come here.

01:00:25.273 --> 01:00:27.493
I don't have the brains
to become a lawyer like Ryan,

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:28.842
I'm sorry.

01:00:28.929 --> 01:00:30.452
But let me tell you something,

01:00:30.539 --> 01:00:31.976
your son, Ryan,

01:00:32.063 --> 01:00:33.760
was going to see
our family business

01:00:33.847 --> 01:00:35.327
go down the fucking toilet.

01:00:35.414 --> 01:00:36.981
And here's something else
for nothing.

01:00:37.068 --> 01:00:38.635
He was working for the Feds.

01:00:44.858 --> 01:00:46.077
I don't believe that.

01:00:46.164 --> 01:00:47.382
Oh, don't ya?

01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:50.995
Ryan's the reason
we're here, Paddy.

01:00:52.605 --> 01:00:54.085
No, son.

01:00:55.739 --> 01:00:57.654
You're the reason
we're here.

01:01:13.495 --> 01:01:15.454
Jesus fucking wept.

01:01:31.426 --> 01:01:32.863
Fuck!

01:01:34.386 --> 01:01:35.735
Fuck!

01:01:57.931 --> 01:02:00.281
Dr. Miller,
did you get my message?

01:02:01.761 --> 01:02:03.371
He was a good man.

01:02:03.458 --> 01:02:05.504
Yeah, I know he was.

01:02:05.591 --> 01:02:07.375
That's why I chose him.

01:02:07.462 --> 01:02:09.029
But so was Mick.

01:02:09.116 --> 01:02:11.510
I just wanted
to protect my son!

01:02:11.597 --> 01:02:13.773
I'm trying
to protect my brother.

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.340
And I want him back...

01:02:16.907 --> 01:02:18.343
...and then you can have
your son back.

01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:19.561
There's a morgue.

01:02:19.648 --> 01:02:21.433
Lower basement.

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:24.131
You come alone, with Bobby,
and I'll be there with Ryan.

01:02:25.263 --> 01:02:27.134
Dr. Miller...

01:02:27.221 --> 01:02:29.484
I was born at night...

01:02:29.571 --> 01:02:32.705
but it wasn't
fucking last night.

01:02:32.792 --> 01:02:34.315
There's another Fed
in this building.

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:38.145
He came in the car
with my brother.

01:02:38.232 --> 01:02:41.061
Did you really think
I was just going to trust you?

01:02:42.062 --> 01:02:45.979
I swear on my life,
I will be alone. Deal?

01:02:47.415 --> 01:02:49.113
On your life, huh?

01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:53.291
Can't ask fairer than that.

01:02:55.597 --> 01:02:57.425
That's the morgue.

01:02:57.512 --> 01:02:58.644
That's the best way out.

01:02:58.731 --> 01:03:00.602
What about the hostages?

01:03:00.689 --> 01:03:02.561
Bring them down here.

01:03:02.648 --> 01:03:04.215
Lock them in.

01:03:04.302 --> 01:03:05.912
Americans love a spectacle.

01:03:07.087 --> 01:03:08.349
Let's give it to them.

01:03:08.436 --> 01:03:09.786
He's a liability.

01:03:09.873 --> 01:03:11.613
That's what he fucking is.

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.267
Nothing new, Paddy.

01:03:13.833 --> 01:03:16.270
He's out of control.
It's my fault.

01:03:16.357 --> 01:03:19.447
My old man used to beat me
something brutal,

01:03:19.534 --> 01:03:21.232
and I swore
I'd never do the same,

01:03:21.319 --> 01:03:23.756
but maybe Seany needed it.

01:03:24.713 --> 01:03:26.367
You did all you could.

01:03:26.454 --> 01:03:29.631
Not every child responds well
to the stern hand.

01:03:29.718 --> 01:03:33.157
And the apple
don't fall far from the tree.

01:03:33.244 --> 01:03:35.202
That's another piece of wisdom.

01:03:35.899 --> 01:03:37.204
Get these people up here, John.

01:03:37.291 --> 01:03:38.771
Up, up, up, up, up!

01:03:38.858 --> 01:03:41.295
Move, fuckers, move,
the lot of ya's!

01:03:41.382 --> 01:03:43.123
The lot of ya's, go!

01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:45.386
No funny business,
cocksucker!

01:03:45.473 --> 01:03:47.519
Move, ya cunt, move!

01:03:50.087 --> 01:03:51.871
The Feds are about
to make their move.

01:03:51.958 --> 01:03:53.481
We're making ours first.

01:03:53.568 --> 01:03:54.874
Time's up, Paddy.

01:03:54.961 --> 01:03:56.354
Let's go.

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:00.227
People, come on!
Everybody in here!

01:04:00.314 --> 01:04:02.012
Everybody, come on!
Come on, come one!

01:04:02.099 --> 01:04:03.622
Move! Move! Move!

01:04:03.709 --> 01:04:05.450
No funny business
or you're fuckin' dead!

01:04:05.537 --> 01:04:07.408
Where the fuck are you going?
Go in there!

01:04:07.495 --> 01:04:09.106
Get down
with the rest of them!

01:04:09.193 --> 01:04:11.021
You're not a fucking guest,
you're a hostage!

01:04:11.108 --> 01:04:12.457
Come on.

01:04:12.544 --> 01:04:13.545
File in, thank you.

01:04:13.632 --> 01:04:15.155
Sean.What?

01:04:17.244 --> 01:04:19.290
This is
a bad situation we're in.

01:04:19.377 --> 01:04:20.639
We have to think carefully now.

01:04:20.726 --> 01:04:22.293
We have to be calm.
We have to be clear.

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:25.905
I am being fucking calm
and I am being clear.

01:04:26.732 --> 01:04:30.344
Why don't you just let
Little Seany deal with this,
all right?

01:04:35.306 --> 01:04:37.351
Right!

01:04:37.438 --> 01:04:39.701
I want you all
to fucking listen
very carefully to me.

01:04:50.147 --> 01:04:51.278
Behind you.

01:04:52.062 --> 01:04:53.541
Stay still.

01:04:53.628 --> 01:04:55.456
Arms up!

01:04:55.543 --> 01:04:56.631
Turn around slowly.

01:04:56.718 --> 01:04:58.503
Fuck! Come here!

01:05:07.381 --> 01:05:08.600
This one's so easy.

01:05:10.254 --> 01:05:11.559
Take that!

01:05:11.646 --> 01:05:12.909
Cunt.

01:05:24.094 --> 01:05:26.183
Fall back! Relax!
Fall Back!

01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:27.836
You fucking bitch!

01:05:33.059 --> 01:05:34.191
Johnno, go.

01:06:00.695 --> 01:06:02.219
Danny?

01:06:04.743 --> 01:06:06.136
Oi!

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:08.442
Wake up!

01:06:42.302 --> 01:06:43.782
Give me the boy!

01:06:44.391 --> 01:06:45.914
Give me the boy.

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:48.613
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the fuck's going on?

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:50.397
She killed Danny.

01:06:50.484 --> 01:06:52.791
This is not on that boy.

01:06:52.878 --> 01:06:54.358
This is on all of us.

01:06:54.967 --> 01:06:57.535
Take it down a notch,
we all wanna get out of here.

01:06:59.624 --> 01:07:01.756
I'm following through
on an agreement

01:07:01.843 --> 01:07:03.802
to get Ryan back

01:07:03.889 --> 01:07:05.499
and to get us all home,

01:07:05.586 --> 01:07:08.372
and that's it.

01:07:08.459 --> 01:07:10.156
I'm going downstairs, Paddy.

01:07:10.243 --> 01:07:13.159
Fine. I'm coming with you.

01:07:13.246 --> 01:07:14.639
Bring the boy.

01:07:17.424 --> 01:07:19.426
Have you lost hold
of yourself?

01:07:19.513 --> 01:07:21.602
You're lucky Liam didn't
shoot you in the fucking head.

01:07:22.299 --> 01:07:24.431
Her time will come.

01:07:24.518 --> 01:07:25.606
Come on,

01:07:25.693 --> 01:07:28.044
we're gonna go
see your mom, see.

01:07:28.522 --> 01:07:29.958
You stay close to me.

01:07:30.481 --> 01:07:32.178
Come on, Paddy.

01:07:39.446 --> 01:07:41.144
Jesus Christ,

01:07:42.145 --> 01:07:44.321
what the hell
are they all waiting for?

01:07:44.408 --> 01:07:45.974
The longer we wait,

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:48.194
the more Sean will take matters
into his own hands.

01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:55.332
You stay right here.

01:07:59.553 --> 01:08:01.860
Jesus.

01:08:01.947 --> 01:08:04.950
You guys made it.Yeah.

01:08:05.037 --> 01:08:06.821
How are you feeling?

01:08:06.908 --> 01:08:08.475
Not so good.

01:08:08.562 --> 01:08:10.042
Hang in there
just a little longer.

01:08:11.043 --> 01:08:12.610
I spoke to your brother.

01:08:12.697 --> 01:08:14.264
We're gonna do an exchange
and get you home.

01:08:14.351 --> 01:08:16.266
What?Wait, wait, wait.
An exchange for what?

01:08:16.353 --> 01:08:17.397
He'll fucking kill me.

01:08:17.484 --> 01:08:18.790
For my son.

01:08:19.225 --> 01:08:21.923
I'm coming with you.No, you're not.

01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:23.360
He thinks I'm working
with the Feds.

01:08:23.447 --> 01:08:24.709
I told him I'd come alone.

01:08:25.536 --> 01:08:27.277
Fuck!

01:08:27.364 --> 01:08:28.539
This is dangerous.

01:08:28.626 --> 01:08:29.714
I'll be fine.

01:08:29.801 --> 01:08:30.932
He's right.

01:08:31.019 --> 01:08:32.543
No matter what he told you,

01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:34.980
my brother always got
another motive, it's me--

01:08:35.067 --> 01:08:37.591
I'll protect you. I promise.

01:08:40.768 --> 01:08:42.292
Let's go.

01:08:54.652 --> 01:08:56.567
Sign says
the morgue's down here.

01:08:58.482 --> 01:09:02.529
Doc, I'm pretty
fucking bleeding.

01:09:02.616 --> 01:09:05.880
Just stay with me.
I'll take a look.

01:09:05.967 --> 01:09:07.752
Come on, keep up.

01:09:13.410 --> 01:09:14.802
Hang in there.

01:09:16.108 --> 01:09:17.892
You're almost home.

01:09:20.765 --> 01:09:23.985
Well, would you look at
the fuckin' state of you, chum.

01:09:30.296 --> 01:09:32.168
Nice to put a face
to the voice.

01:09:33.691 --> 01:09:34.996
Florence Nightingale.

01:09:35.562 --> 01:09:37.434
Take it easy.Where's Bobby?

01:09:37.521 --> 01:09:39.697
He's right here.

01:09:39.784 --> 01:09:41.351
Bobby!Mom...

01:09:42.787 --> 01:09:44.180
You okay, buddy?

01:09:44.267 --> 01:09:45.355
I'm okay.

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:47.661
I'm relieved to see you, son.

01:09:47.748 --> 01:09:49.533
Hey, Da.

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:52.666
Now I'm going to give you back
your little boy,

01:09:52.753 --> 01:09:55.321
and you're going to give
us back our little boy.

01:09:55.408 --> 01:09:57.497
And we're gonna come out of here
the way we came in.

01:09:58.411 --> 01:10:00.196
Just like that?

01:10:00.283 --> 01:10:02.372
Just like that.

01:10:02.459 --> 01:10:05.810
Suffering Jesus,
can we please
put the weapons away

01:10:05.897 --> 01:10:07.507
and get this over with?

01:10:15.863 --> 01:10:17.474
Go to your mommy.Come on.

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:27.005
We thought we lost you, son.

01:10:27.092 --> 01:10:29.486
We thought we lost you.

01:10:29.573 --> 01:10:32.619
Now, let's--
let's get you out of here.

01:10:32.706 --> 01:10:33.925
Why'd you do it?

01:10:36.188 --> 01:10:37.407
What?

01:10:37.494 --> 01:10:39.365
I wanted to run
the business with you.

01:10:39.452 --> 01:10:40.714
You're my brother...

01:10:41.149 --> 01:10:42.499
I fucking loved you.

01:10:42.586 --> 01:10:43.978
What's he talking about?

01:10:44.065 --> 01:10:45.458
He's off his fucking game
on drugs--

01:10:45.545 --> 01:10:48.548
I saw you, you shot
right through my window.

01:10:50.637 --> 01:10:52.117
What?

01:10:53.161 --> 01:10:55.120
That's fucking bollocks!

01:10:55.207 --> 01:10:58.166
All I did was look up to you...

01:11:01.126 --> 01:11:02.475
What?

01:11:02.562 --> 01:11:04.956
You're going
to fucking believe him over me?

01:11:05.957 --> 01:11:08.133
Why don't you
convince me otherwise?

01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:09.787
Fuck off.

01:11:11.789 --> 01:11:13.486
You tried to kill him.

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:15.836
I'll never forgive you.

01:11:20.711 --> 01:11:22.016
Come again?

01:11:24.367 --> 01:11:26.020
You'll never forgive me?

01:11:26.107 --> 01:11:29.894
Who the fuck would you
be forgiving, Paddy Quinn?

01:11:29.981 --> 01:11:31.765
You have no right
to forgive anyone.

01:11:32.679 --> 01:11:36.030
You should be asking forgiveness
off of him, me,

01:11:36.117 --> 01:11:37.815
every other person
you fucked over!

01:11:37.902 --> 01:11:40.992
I watched my mother
drink herself to death
for 10 years

01:11:41.079 --> 01:11:43.168
because she couldn't go home
because of you!

01:11:46.563 --> 01:11:48.347
Shut your fucking mouth.

01:11:48.434 --> 01:11:49.957
Oh, yeah?Yeah.

01:11:52.569 --> 01:11:54.179
Sean, stop it!

01:11:57.487 --> 01:11:59.140
Stop! No!

01:12:01.795 --> 01:12:03.580
Move, move, move, move!

01:12:04.407 --> 01:12:05.582
Ready?

01:12:12.502 --> 01:12:14.547
The snipers are in position
and our men are in place.

01:12:14.634 --> 01:12:17.245
Alright. Send them in.

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:18.377
Move in, now!

01:12:24.035 --> 01:12:25.819
I need you
to listen to me closely.

01:12:26.690 --> 01:12:29.519
You know those tunnels, right?Mm-hmm.

01:12:38.702 --> 01:12:40.791
When I tell you so,
I need you to run.

01:12:40.878 --> 01:12:42.488
Freeze!

01:12:51.845 --> 01:12:55.458
What the fuck happened to you?
What happened to you?

01:12:55.545 --> 01:12:56.894
What the fuck do you mean
happened to me?

01:13:13.519 --> 01:13:14.564
Dad?

01:13:16.479 --> 01:13:17.610
I deserve it.

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.832
I wasn't the father you needed.

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:25.096
I failed you.

01:13:32.277 --> 01:13:34.148
Go! Now! Now! Go!

01:13:39.850 --> 01:13:42.330
Hey! Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:44.071
Not so fast, little man.

01:13:44.158 --> 01:13:45.595
Drop it, you piece of shit!

01:13:45.682 --> 01:13:47.118
Let the kid go.

01:14:09.227 --> 01:14:11.098
You fucking bitch.

01:14:12.491 --> 01:14:15.146
What in the name of God,
possessed you

01:14:15.233 --> 01:14:18.845
to stick your fucking nosy tits
into my father's business?

01:14:18.932 --> 01:14:21.108
Drop your weapon!
Put your weapon down!

01:14:57.231 --> 01:14:59.146
You can fix this.

01:14:59.233 --> 01:15:01.148
I can fix this.

01:15:01.235 --> 01:15:03.020
You can fix this.

01:15:03.107 --> 01:15:04.456
I can fix this.

01:15:04.543 --> 01:15:05.675
Michelle...

01:15:06.589 --> 01:15:08.504
Wake up!

01:15:30.134 --> 01:15:33.180
What did he used to say?

01:15:33.267 --> 01:15:35.531
Blue to ignite.
Red to make it right.

01:15:40.666 --> 01:15:43.713
Wait-- or was it red to ignite,
blue to make it right?

01:15:44.801 --> 01:15:46.629
Shit! I don't remember.

01:15:46.716 --> 01:15:49.370
You can fix this, Michelle.

01:15:49.457 --> 01:15:52.330
Red. Red's hot,
like a fire.

01:15:52.417 --> 01:15:54.071
Blue...

01:16:38.376 --> 01:16:40.030
Well, I'll be damned.

01:16:40.117 --> 01:16:41.074
My God, you're shot.

01:16:41.161 --> 01:16:42.293
Yeah.

01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:44.295
Easy first assignment, huh?

01:16:45.862 --> 01:16:47.254
Where's McBride?

01:16:47.341 --> 01:16:49.126
He...

01:16:49.213 --> 01:16:50.431
Fuck me.

01:16:50.518 --> 01:16:52.433
Yeah.

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:54.522
Where's the kid?

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:55.785
What kid?

01:17:29.775 --> 01:17:31.385
Hey, not tall boy.

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:33.649
Get up.

01:17:34.606 --> 01:17:35.694
I said, get fucking up.

01:17:41.047 --> 01:17:42.179
Are you deaf?

01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:44.398
Good.

01:17:55.932 --> 01:17:58.586
If you run, I'll shoot ya.

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:01.024
If you scream, I'll shoot ya.

01:18:01.111 --> 01:18:03.113
In point of fact, if you do
anything I don't like,

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.375
what'll I do?

01:18:04.462 --> 01:18:06.159
You'll shoot me.

01:18:06.246 --> 01:18:07.683
You're very clever.

01:18:09.467 --> 01:18:10.990
You're such a clever boy, huh?

01:18:11.077 --> 01:18:14.080
Brains to burn,
very bright boy, huh?

01:18:14.951 --> 01:18:16.430
Tell me...

01:18:16.517 --> 01:18:18.345
is this the way out?

01:18:18.432 --> 01:18:21.914
There's a gate at the end.
I-- I used to play down there.

01:18:22.001 --> 01:18:23.916
Good. Take me to it.

01:18:29.574 --> 01:18:32.185
Leave him alone, Sean!
Drop your weapon!

01:18:33.317 --> 01:18:35.058
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:18:35.972 --> 01:18:38.409
Tiger mommies
and their fucking cubs, what?

01:18:38.496 --> 01:18:40.193
Just let him go.

01:18:41.281 --> 01:18:42.674
It's over.

01:18:42.761 --> 01:18:45.808
No, I won't just let him go.

01:18:45.895 --> 01:18:47.635
And it's not all over.

01:18:49.681 --> 01:18:51.161
I see you stopped my bomb.

01:18:52.553 --> 01:18:53.816
One of us, Dr. Miller.

01:18:55.469 --> 01:18:56.949
Do you think you'll be able
to stop a bullet

01:18:57.036 --> 01:18:59.038
going into the back
of his fucking head?

01:18:59.125 --> 01:19:00.561
Okay.

01:19:00.648 --> 01:19:02.433
Put the gun down, then.Okay.

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:03.826
That's it.

01:19:06.089 --> 01:19:07.264
Okay. Easy.

01:19:07.351 --> 01:19:08.352
That's it.

01:19:08.439 --> 01:19:09.614
Easy.

01:19:11.659 --> 01:19:14.053
Bobby, it's gonna be okay.

01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:17.056
We're gonna go home
and practice your soccer kicks.

01:19:18.231 --> 01:19:21.060
Your mommy is a lot fucking
smarter than she looks, boy.

01:19:42.429 --> 01:19:43.691
Mom?

01:19:52.178 --> 01:19:53.701
Okay...

01:20:03.755 --> 01:20:05.801
An incredible scene
here tonight

01:20:05.888 --> 01:20:07.846
at The Mercy Regional Hospital.

01:20:07.933 --> 01:20:09.892
Suspected loyalists
to the Quinn Gang,

01:20:09.979 --> 01:20:13.591
including the patriarch himself,
Patrick "Paddy" Quinn,

01:20:13.678 --> 01:20:16.159
have finally
been brought to justice.

01:20:22.818 --> 01:20:24.820
Hey.Hey.

01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:28.649
So Ryan made it, huh?

01:20:31.565 --> 01:20:33.350
Yeah, luck of the Irish.

01:20:35.613 --> 01:20:38.485
Guess Paddy might make it, too.

01:20:42.533 --> 01:20:44.361
Some of the guys
brought this from inside.

01:20:45.275 --> 01:20:47.103
I thought you'd want it back.

01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:52.151
Thank you.

01:20:52.238 --> 01:20:54.501
Dr. Miller,
can you confirm the reports

01:20:54.588 --> 01:20:56.068
that you helped apprehend
the terrorists

01:20:56.155 --> 01:20:57.722
and saved the hostages?

01:20:58.592 --> 01:21:02.379
I did what any mom would do
to save her son.

01:21:02.988 --> 01:21:06.383
Now I can tell you one thing.
she's an American hero.

01:21:07.645 --> 01:21:10.778
None of us would be alive today
if it wasn't for her courage.

01:21:14.739 --> 01:21:16.567
You know...

01:21:17.046 --> 01:21:18.961
you make
a pretty good partner.

01:21:21.093 --> 01:21:23.052
You're not so bad yourself...

01:21:23.139 --> 01:21:24.618
for a rookie.

01:21:27.273 --> 01:21:28.709
I had that one coming.

01:21:32.409 --> 01:21:33.671
I'll...

01:21:33.758 --> 01:21:35.020
I'll see you around.

01:21:35.847 --> 01:21:37.414
Yeah.

01:21:37.501 --> 01:21:38.894
See you around.

01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:46.989
Shall we?

01:21:47.076 --> 01:21:49.165
Yeah.Yeah.

01:21:49.513 --> 01:21:52.603
So I think we're gonna have
to make the next soccer game.

01:21:52.690 --> 01:21:54.561
Soccer game?

01:21:54.648 --> 01:21:56.781
Who needs that when you've got
an action hero for a mom?

01:21:56.868 --> 01:21:58.000
Really?Yeah.

01:21:58.087 --> 01:21:59.349
You weren't so bad yourself.

01:21:59.436 --> 01:22:00.741
You had a killer
scissor kick back there,

01:22:00.828 --> 01:22:02.004
that was like--Mom...

01:22:02.091 --> 01:22:03.440
It's a back-heel kick.

01:22:03.527 --> 01:22:05.485
Oh, I'm sorry, pardon me.
