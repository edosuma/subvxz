00:14.497 --> 00:19.010
So apparently Sharon Silverman
and Doug Unger are an item now.

00:19.127 --> 00:22.138
I ran into him buying
condoms at the pharmacy.

00:22.464 --> 00:23.941
He was or you were?

00:23.965 --> 00:25.308
He was.

00:25.675 --> 00:27.310
I was buying deodorant.

00:27.469 --> 00:30.656
He said they'd been going
out about three weeks now.

00:30.680 --> 00:32.523
Three weeks, and
they're doing it.

00:32.933 --> 00:34.609
How about that?

00:36.311 --> 00:37.487
Hmm.

00:40.899 --> 00:43.952
Listen. Thing is, um...

00:44.444 --> 00:48.758
and I don't want to
pressure you in any way,

00:48.782 --> 00:51.594
um, but we have been going
out for a long time, so...

00:51.618 --> 00:54.639
So I just want to officially
put it out there...

00:54.663 --> 00:57.683
that, um, that I'm definitely,

00:57.707 --> 01:01.719
definitely, in favor
of having sex.

01:02.587 --> 01:04.096
With you.

01:04.631 --> 01:07.183
Good, because I am too.

01:08.426 --> 01:10.061
Well, yeah.

01:10.136 --> 01:11.521
Um...

01:12.013 --> 01:14.116
only I was thinking of
something more along the lines

01:14.140 --> 01:16.192
of sometime this calendar year.

01:17.894 --> 01:19.487
Look...

01:20.021 --> 01:23.084
Bailey, I'm ready, and, and
I've been ready for a while.

01:23.108 --> 01:25.743
I was waiting for you to
say that you want to.

01:27.237 --> 01:28.830
Are you serious?

01:32.075 --> 01:33.710
That's...

01:34.869 --> 01:37.264
That's- That's ironic,
is what it is.

01:37.288 --> 01:39.007
So... wow.

01:39.499 --> 01:40.643
Uh...

01:40.667 --> 01:42.019
Well, do you want to...?

01:42.043 --> 01:45.106
Well, no, n-not right this second.
God.

01:45.130 --> 01:46.899
I'm wearing totally
yucky underwear, but...

01:46.923 --> 01:49.944
Well, I promise you that
would not be an issue

01:49.968 --> 01:51.602
for more than a second.

01:52.012 --> 01:53.948
Look, Bailey, I want
it to be special.

01:53.972 --> 01:55.574
I mean, is that totally hokey?

01:55.598 --> 01:58.568
No, no. No, uh...

01:58.643 --> 02:00.987
I want it to be special too.
I do.

02:01.396 --> 02:04.490
Special... and... And soon.

02:06.109 --> 02:07.962
S-soon i-is very important.

02:07.986 --> 02:10.589
I can't stress "soon" enough.

02:10.613 --> 02:12.832
Okay. Soon.

02:20.790 --> 02:21.976
Well?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.019
Well, what'd you expect?

02:23.043 --> 02:25.021
I told you those home
things are pretty accurate.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.063
God.

02:26.087 --> 02:27.472
So yes?

02:27.547 --> 02:28.973
Yup.

02:29.507 --> 02:31.517
You okay?

02:31.593 --> 02:33.029
You know I wanted to
be in there with you.

02:33.053 --> 02:34.363
No, Justin, I told you,

02:34.387 --> 02:36.198
two kids sitting in a
clinic waiting room,

02:36.222 --> 02:37.783
everyone would've known.

02:37.807 --> 02:40.828
Yeah, well. So I
guess we should...

02:40.852 --> 02:42.371
I made an appointment
for tomorrow.

02:42.395 --> 02:43.706
You made an appointment?

02:43.730 --> 02:44.947
To, um...

02:45.440 --> 02:47.575
have it, you know,
taken care of.

02:48.276 --> 02:50.755
Wait a second. Just like that?

02:50.779 --> 02:52.548
Without us even talking
about it, or...

02:52.572 --> 02:54.999
What's to talk about, huh?
Nothing.

02:56.993 --> 03:00.806
I'm just going to get it over with as
quickly as possible and then it'll be over,

03:00.830 --> 03:02.840
and I won't have to
think about it anymore.

03:04.334 --> 03:05.561
Julia, let's...

03:05.585 --> 03:07.062
<i>Time is running out.</i>

03:07.086 --> 03:08.397
<i>There's only one more week.</i>

03:08.421 --> 03:11.057
<i>Dunham and Clark's semi-annual...</i>

03:15.929 --> 03:18.157
Did you figure out the
answer to number 12,

03:18.181 --> 03:19.492
because I can't, for
the life of me,

03:19.516 --> 03:22.203
remember how many
electrons barium has.

03:22.227 --> 03:24.862
...Well?

03:25.063 --> 03:27.073
I want to talk about this.

03:27.315 --> 03:29.168
We have to talk about it.

03:29.192 --> 03:30.827
Why?

03:31.569 --> 03:33.881
Justin, it's not going
to change what happened,

03:33.905 --> 03:36.342
and it's not going to change
what I have to do about it,

03:36.366 --> 03:38.459
and we have homework,
so what's the point?

03:38.993 --> 03:41.671
What, are you scared?
Is that it?

03:42.747 --> 03:45.133
All right, fine.
Are you mad at me?

03:46.584 --> 03:48.646
Do you think we did
something wrong?

03:48.670 --> 03:49.939
-'Cause I don't.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.649
Look, I love you,

03:51.673 --> 03:55.268
and I don't think there is
anything wrong with what we did.

03:55.802 --> 03:57.905
So something screwed
up with the condom.

03:57.929 --> 04:00.606
But that is not anyone's fault.

04:01.349 --> 04:02.952
It was just an accident.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.277
I know.

04:09.649 --> 04:11.043
Look, I want to go with you.

04:11.067 --> 04:12.253
No, Justin.

04:12.277 --> 04:14.328
Don't argue with me, all right?

04:17.281 --> 04:19.885
Look, Charlie's going
to take me, okay?

04:19.909 --> 04:21.502
He... He's going to drive me.

04:21.536 --> 04:22.930
Char... You told Charlie?

04:22.954 --> 04:24.881
Yeah. I had to.

04:25.790 --> 04:27.925
I'll call you after it's over.

04:31.754 --> 04:33.181
Number 12?

04:41.014 --> 04:42.607
Damn it!

04:42.765 --> 04:44.692
I don't believe this.

04:48.146 --> 04:50.406
I'm telling you, the whole
damn house is falling apart.

04:50.690 --> 04:54.086
Pipes are like tissue
paper, chimney's cracked,

04:54.110 --> 04:55.337
roof is shot to hell.

04:55.361 --> 04:56.589
I don't want to even think about

04:56.613 --> 04:58.956
how much a new one of those
is going to set us back.

04:59.324 --> 05:01.125
Well, I'll tell you what.

05:02.243 --> 05:04.972
Why don't you go and
get an estimate?

05:04.996 --> 05:07.600
Not for just some
half-assed patch job,

05:07.624 --> 05:09.476
but for the whole
kit and caboodle.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.770
And then come back, and
we'll talk about it,

05:11.794 --> 05:13.304
you and I.

05:14.756 --> 05:16.140
How does that sound?

05:17.258 --> 05:18.809
Uh...

05:18.885 --> 05:21.395
Yeah. Yeah.

05:27.143 --> 05:28.486
You'll never guess.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.196
So tell me.

05:30.521 --> 05:31.624
Okay, this morning at breakfast,

05:31.648 --> 05:33.500
my dad says, " I'm
flying down to LA.

05:33.524 --> 05:34.460
to meet a client."

05:34.484 --> 05:37.254
And my mom, get this, my mom,
totally out of the blue,

05:37.278 --> 05:38.589
says, "You know what, Peter?

05:38.613 --> 05:40.716
"Why don't I fly down there
with you, do some shopping.

05:40.740 --> 05:43.709
And we can spend the
night together."

05:47.038 --> 05:48.589
"We can spend the
night together"?

05:48.790 --> 05:50.392
We can spend the night together.

05:50.416 --> 05:51.727
God, is this fate, or what?

05:51.751 --> 05:53.511
They're going to be
gone till Friday.

05:54.253 --> 05:55.731
Do you have, ya
know, protection?

05:55.755 --> 05:57.816
Because I have a doctor's appointment,
but it's not till tomorrow.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.308
Got it covered...

05:59.759 --> 06:00.935
so to speak.

06:01.844 --> 06:03.447
Oh, test on the atom bomb.

06:03.471 --> 06:04.365
Mwah.

06:04.389 --> 06:06.357
Like I'm going to be
able to concentrate.

06:06.432 --> 06:07.775
Bye. Bye.

06:17.735 --> 06:18.671
Jule.

06:18.695 --> 06:20.871
Have you at least talked to
somebody about this, Julia?

06:20.947 --> 06:21.882
Julia!

06:21.906 --> 06:24.760
I don't need to talk to anyone, okay?
I know what I'm doing.

06:24.784 --> 06:26.627
Oh, yeah. I can see that.

06:31.582 --> 06:33.050
All right, look.

06:33.668 --> 06:35.938
I'm coming with you.
I'm going to take you.

06:35.962 --> 06:37.272
- No.
- Yes, Julia.

06:37.296 --> 06:38.597
No argument.

06:38.798 --> 06:40.808
Look, Charlie...

06:41.300 --> 06:43.487
Justin's going to be there, okay?
He's meeting me.

06:43.511 --> 06:46.564
So you don't have to worry.

06:48.349 --> 06:49.817
Don't worry!

06:55.231 --> 06:58.534
Okay. Satin sheets
in the bedroom.

06:59.193 --> 07:00.754
Well, you've... You've, uh...

07:00.778 --> 07:02.297
You've really gone all out.

07:02.321 --> 07:05.624
Well, yeah. This is the most
important night of my life so far.

07:06.117 --> 07:07.302
Uh... yeah.

07:07.326 --> 07:09.972
Besides, how many things can
you look back on and say,

07:09.996 --> 07:12.840
"You know what? That
changed everything."

07:14.167 --> 07:17.187
Right. Uh, you know
what, uh, Sarah,

07:17.211 --> 07:21.066
not to, um... diminish
my own, uh, you know...

07:21.090 --> 07:24.320
but, um, I don't know if, uh...

07:24.344 --> 07:25.978
Bailey...

07:26.721 --> 07:29.366
Look, tonight I'm going to
share something with you

07:29.390 --> 07:32.369
that is so, so important.

07:32.393 --> 07:35.613
And I'm never going to share
that with anybody ever again.

07:36.064 --> 07:40.117
And it's like after this,
I really am a woman.

07:41.652 --> 07:44.038
Well, at least you're
keeping it in perspective.

07:44.655 --> 07:46.133
I'll put on some music, okay?

07:46.157 --> 07:47.458
Okay.

07:50.995 --> 07:52.463
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.484
Uh... you know what? Um...

08:03.508 --> 08:05.611
I don't think that
this is, um...

08:05.635 --> 08:06.977
That this is feeling right.

08:07.095 --> 08:08.322
What, am I leading?

08:08.346 --> 08:10.690
No, no, no, it's not that. Um...

08:11.391 --> 08:13.234
It's... It's... It's...

08:14.018 --> 08:16.330
I don't want you to think
that I don't want to do this,

08:16.354 --> 08:19.407
because I do, I really
want to do this. But...

08:19.565 --> 08:23.212
I don't know, I think maybe
you're making it into too much,

08:23.236 --> 08:25.329
and... And I'm starting
to feel pressure.

08:25.405 --> 08:26.673
To perform.

08:26.697 --> 08:28.717
No, no, no, I'm fine with that.

08:28.741 --> 08:30.626
Believe me. It's...
It's... It's...

08:30.827 --> 08:33.054
pressure to, like, change
your life or something,

08:33.078 --> 08:35.715
and I don't know
that I can do that.

08:37.375 --> 08:39.092
Look, I...

08:39.460 --> 08:43.440
I don't want to disappoint you
because I really do love you,

08:43.464 --> 08:44.890
and so...

08:45.425 --> 08:49.145
so I don't think I
want to do this.

08:49.554 --> 08:50.980
Not tonight.

08:51.264 --> 08:52.440
Okay?

09:01.023 --> 09:03.284
Maybe it's in the tree trunk.

09:03.484 --> 09:05.462
No, sweetie, that's
a candlestick.

09:05.486 --> 09:08.465
Then Mark and Robin with
your cousins at table 10.

09:08.489 --> 09:10.499
That's next to the dance floor.

09:11.742 --> 09:13.753
Julia Salinger?

09:20.293 --> 09:21.353
Julia.

09:21.377 --> 09:22.646
Julia, hey, wait.

09:22.670 --> 09:24.273
What? What are you doing here?

09:24.297 --> 09:26.066
I-I-I'm sorry. Please
don't get angry.

09:26.090 --> 09:27.975
I couldn't not come.

09:28.259 --> 09:29.695
Wow, that was fast.

09:29.719 --> 09:31.071
I didn't know you'd
be out so soon.

09:31.095 --> 09:32.114
Yeah, well, um...

09:32.138 --> 09:33.115
Where's Charlie?

09:33.139 --> 09:34.398
Wait.

09:34.682 --> 09:35.868
You went alone?

09:35.892 --> 09:37.568
I, uh...

09:37.894 --> 09:39.612
I did... I didn't do it.

09:39.770 --> 09:42.249
I couldn't do it.
I just ran out.

09:42.273 --> 09:43.657
I left.

09:45.443 --> 09:47.754
All right, well, maybe
it was too quick.

09:47.778 --> 09:49.330
Maybe you, uh...

09:49.655 --> 09:51.008
need a couple more days?

09:51.032 --> 09:52.468
No, no, you don't get it.

09:52.492 --> 09:54.178
It's not that I couldn't do it.

09:54.202 --> 09:56.378
I'm not sure if I want to.

09:56.996 --> 09:59.548
You're not sure you want
to have the abortion?

10:00.124 --> 10:01.768
I was just sitting there,
and all of a sudden,

10:01.792 --> 10:05.564
I felt this, this panic,
like, "What am I doing?

10:05.588 --> 10:06.899
"What am I giving up?

10:06.923 --> 10:08.817
What if this is
something that I want?"

10:08.841 --> 10:10.976
Okay, okay, uh...

10:11.928 --> 10:14.198
We should talk about this.
We should, uh...

10:14.222 --> 10:16.158
We should sit down...

10:16.182 --> 10:18.275
You're upset about this.

10:18.309 --> 10:19.495
No, I'm not...

10:19.519 --> 10:21.872
You just wanted me
to get it over with,

10:21.896 --> 10:23.040
just get rid of it.

10:23.064 --> 10:24.333
No, I'm... I'm...

10:24.357 --> 10:26.742
Justin, I thought you
would understand.

10:33.032 --> 10:34.092
Hey.

10:34.116 --> 10:35.459
- Hey.
- Hey, um...

10:36.077 --> 10:37.920
Are we...? Are we cool?

10:38.329 --> 10:39.473
What? Oh, yeah.

10:39.497 --> 10:41.183
Okay. Okay, good.

10:41.207 --> 10:44.686
Good, because I was thinking
basically all last night

10:44.710 --> 10:46.136
how much I want to try again.

10:46.712 --> 10:47.689
Are you sure?

10:47.713 --> 10:49.566
Because I've got that
doctor's appointment today,

10:49.590 --> 10:50.484
- but I could cancel.
- No, no.

10:50.508 --> 10:52.361
Don't cancel it.
Don't cancel it.

10:52.385 --> 10:55.364
But, uh, maybe we could
try this whole thing

10:55.388 --> 10:58.566
like, with a little less,
you know, fanfare.

10:58.641 --> 11:00.276
A little lower key.

11:00.393 --> 11:01.828
Less fanfare, lower key.

11:01.852 --> 11:02.913
Right.

11:02.937 --> 11:04.414
Like we're supposed
to go to the movies

11:04.438 --> 11:05.666
tomorrow night, right?

11:05.690 --> 11:10.286
So maybe, afterwards, we go
back to my house, and...

11:10.695 --> 11:12.547
And maybe something happens.

11:12.571 --> 11:14.091
Or maybe it doesn't.

11:14.115 --> 11:15.592
See, maybe it's
some other night.

11:15.616 --> 11:17.293
Doesn't really matter.

11:17.743 --> 11:19.179
I'm sorry, but I thought

11:19.203 --> 11:21.723
that soon was of the utmost importance.
Your words.

11:21.747 --> 11:22.891
Yeah, I know, I know.

11:22.915 --> 11:25.435
But I just don't
want, like... Like...

11:25.459 --> 11:28.981
spotlights and music and plans.

11:29.005 --> 11:31.441
You know? I want it
to happen like...

11:31.465 --> 11:32.943
Like the first time we kissed.

11:32.967 --> 11:34.820
You know, just out of the blue.

11:34.844 --> 11:36.738
Like... Like, maybe we're
sitting on my bed,

11:36.762 --> 11:39.408
together, and, and I
start to kiss you,

11:39.432 --> 11:41.368
and I start to touch you, and
then don't want to stop,

11:41.392 --> 11:42.494
and then it just happens.

11:42.518 --> 11:44.288
And it's exactly right.

11:44.312 --> 11:46.164
- It's perfect.
- Right.

11:46.188 --> 11:48.073
Right, because it will be.

11:49.108 --> 11:50.585
So look through the literature.

11:50.609 --> 11:51.837
Think about it.

11:51.861 --> 11:54.079
And call me again, and
we'll talk some more.

11:54.196 --> 11:55.914
Okay, thanks.

11:55.948 --> 11:58.751
You did the right thing, coming
in to talk about this, Julia.

12:02.705 --> 12:03.682
Sarah.

12:03.706 --> 12:05.058
Wow. Heh.

12:05.082 --> 12:07.394
This is weird, huh? God,
so much for privacy.

12:07.418 --> 12:08.603
I had no idea we had the same...

12:08.627 --> 12:11.055
Yeah, listen, I have got to go.

12:15.801 --> 12:17.144
Hey.

12:17.720 --> 12:19.355
Oh, hey.

12:20.222 --> 12:21.607
So, um...

12:21.640 --> 12:23.901
Sarah said she ran into you
today at the doctor's office.

12:25.811 --> 12:27.529
She said you looked upset.

12:28.189 --> 12:29.333
No.

12:29.357 --> 12:30.783
I'm okay.

12:30.816 --> 12:31.793
Yeah?

12:31.817 --> 12:33.243
Mm-hmm.

12:34.987 --> 12:38.207
He's not pressuring you or
anything, Justin, is he?

12:41.035 --> 12:42.461
What do you mean?

12:43.037 --> 12:44.421
I mean...

12:44.455 --> 12:48.226
that this is a big
step, Jule, sex.

12:48.250 --> 12:50.729
And guys, sometimes they
don't even think about

12:50.753 --> 12:52.429
whether or not the girl's ready.

12:55.007 --> 12:56.109
I know.

12:56.133 --> 12:58.060
It's none of my business, right?

13:00.638 --> 13:02.356
Look...

13:03.766 --> 13:05.359
I know you guys love each other,

13:05.476 --> 13:07.496
and... And... And I'm sure you
know what you're doing.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.906
Just... Just be careful, okay?

13:11.232 --> 13:12.626
I mean, obviously, you are,

13:12.650 --> 13:15.577
because that's why you
were there today, right?

13:20.282 --> 13:22.376
That's not why... uh...

13:25.204 --> 13:27.005
We were careful.

13:27.623 --> 13:28.767
Always.

13:28.791 --> 13:30.592
Every time.

13:34.880 --> 13:38.016
You're late... Bay.

13:39.635 --> 13:41.979
You are so too late.

13:47.977 --> 13:49.445
Hey.

13:49.645 --> 13:50.622
Were you going to call me?

13:50.646 --> 13:52.499
I left, like, three
messages for you.

13:52.523 --> 13:55.168
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
I was going to.

13:55.192 --> 13:59.047
I'm just trying not
to spend every second

13:59.071 --> 14:02.717
of every minute of every
hour thinking about this.

14:02.741 --> 14:03.885
Oh.

14:03.909 --> 14:05.544
Is that working?

14:08.789 --> 14:10.132
Look...

14:11.208 --> 14:13.844
the reason that I
called you was, um...

14:14.670 --> 14:16.388
I was thinking...

14:19.341 --> 14:21.060
I'm thinking, uh...

14:24.638 --> 14:26.231
Okay.

14:28.851 --> 14:30.694
We could do this.

14:31.061 --> 14:32.654
We could have a baby.

14:35.316 --> 14:37.794
I figure I got a lot of
extra credit, right?

14:37.818 --> 14:39.588
If they count my AP classes,

14:39.612 --> 14:41.840
I could get my
diploma this spring.

14:41.864 --> 14:44.801
And I bet that the,
the news station

14:44.825 --> 14:46.335
would hire me full-time.

14:46.368 --> 14:50.130
We could find a way
to make this work.

14:53.834 --> 14:55.228
So what if we're young?

14:55.252 --> 14:57.846
So what if there's stuff
we have to give up?

14:58.047 --> 14:59.807
We get something too.

15:01.550 --> 15:07.564
Julia, people who have a lot
less than us have kids.

15:10.518 --> 15:13.529
Even people who love
each other less.

15:23.322 --> 15:27.084
Justin said we could have
the baby if I wanted to.

15:30.079 --> 15:32.974
He said he would help
take care of us,

15:32.998 --> 15:35.894
graduate school early and stuff.

15:35.918 --> 15:38.470
Pretty incredible, huh?

15:39.547 --> 15:40.857
Yeah.

15:40.881 --> 15:42.734
But he doesn't mean it.

15:42.758 --> 15:45.894
I mean, he means it, but...

15:46.178 --> 15:48.990
I mean, how...? How...? How
could I do that to him?

15:49.014 --> 15:51.984
What a terrible thing.

15:52.518 --> 15:56.405
And, you know, he'd hate me
for it, sooner or later.

15:57.022 --> 15:57.999
Julia...

15:58.023 --> 16:01.920
Anyway, I can have the baby and
then give it up for adoption.

16:01.944 --> 16:03.797
But the doctor talked
to me about that.

16:03.821 --> 16:06.957
And... what's wrong with that?

16:07.116 --> 16:08.343
I don't know.

16:08.367 --> 16:09.719
Maybe that's right.

16:09.743 --> 16:12.963
Doesn't that seem more
moral or something?

16:14.164 --> 16:16.091
I can't answer that, Jule.

16:18.085 --> 16:21.022
Then I'd be pregnant for
the rest of school,

16:21.046 --> 16:24.943
and I'd be pregnant when I
was applying for colleges

16:24.967 --> 16:26.152
and for the interviews.

16:26.176 --> 16:28.979
You think people would
look at me differently?

16:32.600 --> 16:34.067
Yeah.

16:34.101 --> 16:35.694
Obviously.

16:37.646 --> 16:40.542
So maybe I should put
off college for a year.

16:40.566 --> 16:44.912
You know, just take a year off
and have the baby on my own.

16:45.487 --> 16:47.331
Why can't I do that?

16:48.574 --> 16:50.375
You can do that, Jule.

16:51.118 --> 16:52.669
If you want to, you can...

16:53.245 --> 16:56.349
You can keep the baby...
in this house...

16:56.373 --> 16:58.050
here, with all of us.

16:59.543 --> 17:01.053
Okay.

17:01.337 --> 17:02.638
You just...

17:03.589 --> 17:06.568
You have to make sure that
you're ready to be a mother,

17:06.592 --> 17:10.145
and, uh, I'm not
sure that you are.

17:12.181 --> 17:13.157
So what?

17:13.182 --> 17:16.202
I mean, stuff happens in life.

17:16.226 --> 17:17.996
Who cares if you're ready?

17:18.020 --> 17:19.247
Right? You just do it.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.198
I mean, who knows
that better than us?

17:21.815 --> 17:23.042
Right.

17:23.067 --> 17:27.454
And how is this different
from you and Owen?

17:27.488 --> 17:28.997
Let's be honest.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.583
Were you ready to be a dad?

17:33.243 --> 17:34.544
No.

17:34.995 --> 17:37.506
And now, I mean, would you...

17:38.415 --> 17:40.842
give him back if
you had a chance?

17:42.169 --> 17:43.595
No.

17:44.088 --> 17:46.274
You see? So...

17:46.298 --> 17:47.442
Then how can I...

17:47.466 --> 17:49.309
It's not the same, Jule.

17:49.426 --> 17:51.404
I was... I was 24 years old.

17:51.428 --> 17:53.480
I'd gone to college.

17:53.764 --> 17:56.149
I'd had a chance
to live a little.

17:57.768 --> 18:00.320
You would be giving up so much.

18:00.729 --> 18:02.114
And you have...

18:02.773 --> 18:04.584
all this potential, you know?

18:04.608 --> 18:06.994
So much more than I'm
ever going to have.

18:09.363 --> 18:11.248
To throw that all away...

18:14.618 --> 18:17.462
So, what choice do I have left?

18:28.465 --> 18:30.100
What'd I do to myself?

18:39.268 --> 18:40.453
Oh, um...

18:40.477 --> 18:42.080
- Hey.
- That was fast.

18:42.104 --> 18:44.197
Yeah. I ran a couple lights.

18:44.314 --> 18:47.367
Uh, your... On the phone,
your voice was, uh...

18:47.776 --> 18:49.369
What is it?

18:49.486 --> 18:51.381
Please, please. I'm dying.

18:51.405 --> 18:52.956
You want to...

18:58.454 --> 19:00.380
Man, this family...

19:00.914 --> 19:03.018
You ought to get a medal
for just coming over here.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.811
I mean, all I want to
do is go to a movie,

19:04.835 --> 19:08.023
but no, Bailey's off smooching,
Julia's locked in her room,

19:08.047 --> 19:10.900
and Charlie keeps saying, you know what
Claud, it's not a good time right now.

19:10.924 --> 19:12.652
I mean, I swear,
sometimes the only thing

19:12.676 --> 19:14.936
anyone says to me in this
house is, "Go away."

19:19.475 --> 19:22.152
Can I hang out with you, Justin?

19:28.859 --> 19:30.170
Justin?

19:30.194 --> 19:32.913
Claud, just go away, all right?

19:33.697 --> 19:35.290
Just get out of here.

19:47.711 --> 19:49.105
Hey, Jule, um...

19:49.129 --> 19:51.181
Go away, Claud. Get out of here.

19:52.633 --> 19:54.694
Did you and Justin have
a fight or something?

19:54.718 --> 19:56.103
What?

19:56.678 --> 19:58.021
No.

19:58.472 --> 20:01.149
Then why was he crying in
the backyard just now?

20:02.476 --> 20:03.985
He was crying?

20:04.103 --> 20:06.321
Well, not a lot, but yeah.

20:06.605 --> 20:08.917
I mean, he didn't
want me to see.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.158
What happened?

20:10.275 --> 20:11.827
Nothing.

20:12.027 --> 20:14.079
Then why would he be...

20:15.155 --> 20:16.957
You're going to bed?

20:17.825 --> 20:19.584
It's not even nine o'clock.

20:19.660 --> 20:21.670
I'm tired, okay?

20:22.788 --> 20:24.089
What are these?

20:24.206 --> 20:25.841
Claud, wait!

20:30.045 --> 20:31.304
Why would...?

20:37.094 --> 20:38.603
Are you...?

20:51.316 --> 20:52.909
What are you going to do?

20:56.864 --> 20:58.748
Are you going to have the baby?

21:00.826 --> 21:02.627
I don't think so.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.629
You're not?

21:07.499 --> 21:09.301
You're not going to have it?

21:10.377 --> 21:12.179
Claud!

21:18.260 --> 21:20.020
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:20.429 --> 21:21.531
We still on for lunch?

21:21.555 --> 21:22.532
Yeah, um...

21:22.556 --> 21:24.993
One sec, Julia asked me
to take notes for her

21:25.017 --> 21:26.578
in McFarland's class.

21:26.602 --> 21:28.320
Okay, done.

21:28.437 --> 21:30.489
Here, um, can you give
these to her, please?

21:33.442 --> 21:34.910
You know what?

21:35.194 --> 21:38.163
Maybe you could come by later
and give these to her yourself.

21:38.488 --> 21:41.176
Uh, I've got rehearsal
this afternoon.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.210
Well, then... Then afterwards,

21:43.285 --> 21:47.182
because I was thinking that it might
really do her some good to talk...

21:47.206 --> 21:49.674
You know, I'd rather not, okay?

21:50.542 --> 21:52.854
- Why not?
- Because...

21:52.878 --> 21:55.773
Uh, because she's got a
lot going on right now,

21:55.797 --> 21:57.984
and the last thing she needs
is to know what I think.

21:58.008 --> 22:00.769
Well, what do you think?

22:02.512 --> 22:04.314
What do you think, Sarah?

22:05.307 --> 22:06.826
Nothing.

22:06.850 --> 22:08.953
Nothing. Let's not
talk about it, okay?

22:08.977 --> 22:11.238
Is it still mac and
cheese in the cafeteria?

22:19.696 --> 22:21.540
You don't have to leave.

22:22.032 --> 22:23.009
That's okay.

22:23.033 --> 22:25.303
Claudia, I want to talk to you.

22:25.327 --> 22:26.262
That's okay.

22:26.286 --> 22:27.754
Claudia!

22:30.082 --> 22:31.476
I don't get it.

22:31.500 --> 22:32.769
What?

22:32.793 --> 22:34.803
How could you even think
about doing this?

22:35.087 --> 22:36.721
What about Owen?

22:36.797 --> 22:38.608
He was an accident
too, I mean...

22:38.632 --> 22:41.017
Do you think Mom and Dad
should never have had him?

22:41.760 --> 22:44.238
This... is different.

22:44.262 --> 22:47.867
How is it different? It's
not different at all.

22:47.891 --> 22:51.486
Claudia, I am too
young to have a baby!

22:54.940 --> 22:56.533
Claudia, please.

22:58.527 --> 23:00.161
If you do this...

23:01.363 --> 23:04.207
there are people who are going
to say that it's murder.

23:05.117 --> 23:07.804
And you have to tell me what to
say when they say that about you.

23:07.828 --> 23:10.880
You have to tell me how
to answer them. Please.

23:11.248 --> 23:12.841
I don't know.

23:15.210 --> 23:19.681
But I would not do this if I
thought that that was true.

23:29.224 --> 23:30.775
Bailey...

23:31.184 --> 23:33.236
I want to take you home.

23:33.729 --> 23:35.280
I know.

23:35.439 --> 23:37.032
So bad.

23:37.315 --> 23:38.700
I know.

23:43.113 --> 23:45.248
We're not going to
do this, are we?

23:48.076 --> 23:49.627
No.

23:52.622 --> 23:55.216
God, I wish you would have
brought this up a week ago.

23:55.375 --> 23:58.845
Yeah. We could've snuck
in under the wire, huh?

24:03.091 --> 24:05.393
So does this make us
lucky or unlucky?

24:07.679 --> 24:09.522
Hmm. Kind of both, I guess.

24:27.032 --> 24:28.833
So, Jule...

24:29.242 --> 24:30.752
what time tomorrow?

24:33.121 --> 24:35.131
Oh, um...

24:35.290 --> 24:37.050
Two o'clock.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.886
Can I go with you?

24:40.212 --> 24:41.763
I want to.

24:45.008 --> 24:46.768
Yeah, I guess. Okay.

24:46.802 --> 24:48.311
Thanks.

24:52.891 --> 24:55.568
I know you feel alone in
this, Julia, but you're not.

24:56.645 --> 24:59.248
You're not the only one who's
ever made this decision.

24:59.272 --> 25:00.833
Something like a million
women every year...

25:00.857 --> 25:04.452
I know the statistics, Charlie.
Thanks.

25:08.532 --> 25:10.375
I went with a girlfriend once.

25:12.953 --> 25:14.546
To get one.

25:15.831 --> 25:17.517
In college.

25:17.541 --> 25:19.092
You did?

25:19.209 --> 25:20.686
Yeah.

25:20.710 --> 25:23.138
...Debra.

25:24.798 --> 25:26.516
Debra...

25:29.177 --> 25:31.229
Debra, "Lots of
Bracelets" Debra.

25:35.016 --> 25:37.787
We didn't talk much beforehand
about the decision, I mean,

25:37.811 --> 25:40.081
it just made sense,
for both of us.

25:40.105 --> 25:41.457
We weren't even 20,

25:41.481 --> 25:45.618
and it wasn't like we were in
love with each other or anything.

25:46.361 --> 25:47.829
So...

25:48.405 --> 25:51.458
I felt really bad about it
for a while afterwards.

25:51.908 --> 25:55.378
But, that feeling...
it goes away.

25:56.288 --> 26:00.133
You don't carry it around forever,
Julia, you really don't. I mean...

26:00.458 --> 26:02.228
before this happened with you,

26:02.252 --> 26:04.888
I hadn't even thought
about it in, like, years.

26:06.423 --> 26:08.641
And... what about her?

26:09.551 --> 26:11.102
Well...

26:12.429 --> 26:15.491
it took a little time,
I guess, but yeah.

26:15.515 --> 26:17.410
I mean, eventually, she...

26:17.434 --> 26:19.110
She was okay.

26:19.519 --> 26:21.404
You stayed in touch?

26:22.272 --> 26:26.993
Well... um... no, not exactly.

26:29.362 --> 26:33.124
So how do you know she doesn't
still carry this around with her?

26:36.161 --> 26:38.421
All I'm trying to say is...

26:38.914 --> 26:42.967
Is that it's hard now, but
it's going to get easier.

26:45.253 --> 26:46.930
Julia?

26:52.928 --> 26:55.364
Could you stop... swinging?

26:55.388 --> 26:56.856
Sure.

27:00.143 --> 27:02.153
I've been kinda nervous
all day that...

27:02.896 --> 27:04.864
now that you've decided,

27:05.690 --> 27:08.159
I thought you might get
kind of mad at me again.

27:10.195 --> 27:11.881
You might look at me like,

27:11.905 --> 27:14.123
"That's the guy that
did this to me."

27:18.870 --> 27:20.964
You didn't do anything to me.

27:21.998 --> 27:23.675
We did it together.

27:24.709 --> 27:26.636
Right.

27:34.761 --> 27:37.272
You can hug me back, ya
know, that's allowed.

27:40.267 --> 27:42.110
Justin, stop.

27:42.686 --> 27:44.195
What?

27:44.354 --> 27:46.072
Are you angry?

27:46.439 --> 27:48.251
You're angry, I...

27:48.275 --> 27:50.127
I don't get it, you just said
that we did this together.

27:50.151 --> 27:53.830
Yeah! But we did it to me.

27:54.239 --> 27:56.092
And it's in my body,

27:56.116 --> 27:58.543
and I'm the one
making the decision.

27:58.576 --> 27:59.553
Okay, but...

27:59.577 --> 28:02.265
I promise you, you... You don't
know what it feels like.

28:02.289 --> 28:04.799
You may think you
do, but you don't.

28:07.085 --> 28:10.096
All right. Tell me
how it feels, then.

28:12.966 --> 28:16.936
Just... go home... Justin.

28:17.971 --> 28:20.231
Being here with me doesn't help.

28:20.348 --> 28:22.576
And having to explain
it to you doesn't help,

28:22.600 --> 28:25.288
because it's not about you,
and it's not about us.

28:25.312 --> 28:26.414
It's about me.

28:26.438 --> 28:27.415
Julia...

28:27.439 --> 28:29.750
You don't have to worry.
You're going to be okay.

28:29.774 --> 28:31.335
You're going to get
over this pretty soon,

28:31.359 --> 28:33.170
and everything's going
to be back to normal.

28:33.194 --> 28:34.996
That's how it is for guys.

28:35.238 --> 28:37.591
And no one is going to
look at you later and say,

28:37.615 --> 28:39.417
"Guess what he did, once?"

28:39.951 --> 28:41.920
I'm the one they're
going to look at.

28:41.953 --> 28:44.223
I'm the one who's going
to carry this around,

28:44.247 --> 28:46.633
who can't ever get rid of it.

28:48.293 --> 28:51.763
So don't try and share
this with me...

28:52.255 --> 28:53.973
because you can't.

28:54.549 --> 28:56.392
Because it's mine.

29:13.318 --> 29:14.712
Sarah.

29:14.736 --> 29:16.371
Hey. Morning.

29:18.365 --> 29:22.251
Um, thanks for the
notes from yesterday.

29:24.496 --> 29:26.297
Are you waiting for Bay?

29:26.456 --> 29:28.643
Yeah, well, he's
still in the shower.

29:28.667 --> 29:29.810
Ah.

29:29.834 --> 29:32.313
So, you know, I was thinking.

29:32.337 --> 29:37.225
We... We definitely used to talk
more before you and Bay...

29:37.801 --> 29:39.820
which is kind of too bad.

29:39.844 --> 29:43.398
Because it seems like everyone
else in my life is a guy.

29:44.265 --> 29:46.243
And they're all
being really nice,

29:46.267 --> 29:49.121
but there are just some things
you don't want to talk about.

29:49.145 --> 29:50.405
You know?

29:50.480 --> 29:52.031
No kidding.

29:52.065 --> 29:56.619
I tried to call Kirsten,
but she's on a trip.

29:56.653 --> 29:59.956
Kind of a strange
message to leave.

30:00.949 --> 30:05.461
Anyway, I know this is going
to sound really stupid,

30:05.537 --> 30:06.838
but...

30:07.872 --> 30:10.717
I'm actually getting
kind of scared

30:10.959 --> 30:14.730
about what's going to happen
physically, you know?

30:14.754 --> 30:16.315
Julia...

30:16.339 --> 30:17.849
What?

30:19.884 --> 30:21.102
Um...

30:21.803 --> 30:23.604
I'm not the right person.

30:25.765 --> 30:27.191
What?

30:27.851 --> 30:30.746
I'm not trying to
make you feel bad.

30:30.770 --> 30:33.614
I'm really not. Please
don't think that.

30:34.983 --> 30:37.326
I just have problems for myself.

30:38.319 --> 30:40.288
Because of being adopted.

30:41.656 --> 30:43.884
I mean, if my mom would've
made the same choice as you,

30:43.908 --> 30:45.585
I wouldn't be here.

30:47.954 --> 30:49.422
Oh.

30:49.497 --> 30:51.090
Right.

30:51.541 --> 30:55.595
Right. Um...

30:57.380 --> 30:59.150
See, you have to understand...

30:59.174 --> 31:00.600
No, Julia.

31:03.094 --> 31:05.448
I know you need
somebody on your side.

31:05.472 --> 31:07.023
I know that.

31:07.182 --> 31:09.859
And I want to...

31:11.644 --> 31:13.988
but I can't. I'm really sorry.

31:17.150 --> 31:19.368
I just think she wants
to be left alone now.

31:19.986 --> 31:23.382
Yeah, well, it's not like I'm just going
to honk from the curb when she's ready.

31:23.406 --> 31:25.593
I mean, I want to spend
a little time with her

31:25.617 --> 31:29.138
- before we have to leave.
- Justin, Charlie's taking her.

31:29.162 --> 31:30.848
Right, that's what
she said last time.

31:30.872 --> 31:32.715
No. He's taking her.

31:33.291 --> 31:36.187
Justin, that's the way
she wants it, I guess,

31:36.211 --> 31:39.190
so why don't you just
give her some time?

31:39.214 --> 31:41.015
Really, this is hard for her.

31:45.512 --> 31:47.105
You know what, Bailey?

31:47.639 --> 31:49.524
You don't need to tell me that.

31:49.891 --> 31:51.035
It's hard for me too.

31:51.059 --> 31:53.704
I'm not this completely
irrelevant person, all right?

31:53.728 --> 31:55.956
- No one said that... -Yeah well,
that's how everyone's acting.

31:55.980 --> 31:57.500
You know what? And
I am sick of it!

31:57.524 --> 31:59.877
Just because some guys
are jerks doesn't mean

31:59.901 --> 32:01.410
that's me, all right?

32:01.986 --> 32:03.756
I know she's sad.

32:03.780 --> 32:06.541
Well, you know what? I'm
losing something too.

32:08.284 --> 32:10.002
You know what would be nice?

32:10.036 --> 32:14.090
If it wasn't just me saying
"I'm sorry" all the time.

32:14.207 --> 32:17.635
It would be nice if
once... Just once!

32:17.877 --> 32:20.596
Somebody asked me if I was okay.

32:28.388 --> 32:29.907
Charlie?

32:29.931 --> 32:31.607
In here.

32:31.808 --> 32:33.744
Have you seen Owen's
Alcatraz sweatshirt?

32:33.768 --> 32:35.319
Um...

32:35.937 --> 32:37.905
I think we have got to go.

32:39.148 --> 32:41.502
Why? Your appointment's at two o'clock.
It's only...

32:41.526 --> 32:44.412
You have got to take
me now, Charlie.

32:44.654 --> 32:45.955
Okay.

32:47.282 --> 32:48.592
It's gonna rain.

32:48.616 --> 32:50.960
That's what my knee tells me.

32:52.161 --> 32:54.640
Are you okay? You've been
down here for hours.

32:54.664 --> 32:58.217
I'm just going through
what's left of my stuff.

32:59.168 --> 33:01.596
Any idea where Julia went?

33:03.298 --> 33:04.640
Um...

33:04.841 --> 33:06.309
Out.

33:06.885 --> 33:09.312
You know, I worry
about you guys.

33:11.097 --> 33:13.576
There seems to be a lot of
closed doors around here

33:13.600 --> 33:15.828
and, and red eyes and, uh...

33:15.852 --> 33:20.072
If something were going
on, like with Julia,

33:20.148 --> 33:23.075
and I knew about it,
maybe I could help.

33:23.735 --> 33:25.411
You can't help.

33:25.528 --> 33:26.881
Well, okay.

33:26.905 --> 33:29.925
But if something comes up
that you kids can't handle...

33:29.949 --> 33:31.584
Charlie'll take care of her.

33:34.120 --> 33:35.890
And I don't think she's
going to be able

33:35.914 --> 33:38.049
to talk to you about this
because it's just...

33:39.167 --> 33:41.344
too big of a thing, so, um...

33:41.502 --> 33:43.471
maybe you should just
leave her alone.

33:44.589 --> 33:46.057
I won't push.

33:49.719 --> 33:52.813
I want to tell you,
Grandpa, but I can't...

33:54.307 --> 33:56.150
because I'm scared. I mean...

33:56.392 --> 33:59.362
I don't want you to think
any different of her,

33:59.395 --> 34:01.572
and you might if you knew, so...

34:03.733 --> 34:05.743
I think it's better
that you don't.

34:11.532 --> 34:12.885
I should check on Owen.

34:12.909 --> 34:14.511
Are you all right
getting up the stairs?

34:14.534 --> 34:16.170
Yeah, I'll be fine.

34:20.375 --> 34:21.926
Hey.

34:26.547 --> 34:28.349
So, it's over, huh?

34:28.716 --> 34:30.101
I, uh...

34:30.426 --> 34:32.395
had a miscarriage.

34:32.719 --> 34:33.614
What?

34:33.638 --> 34:34.989
The doctor said not to worry,

34:35.014 --> 34:36.815
that it happens in, like...

34:36.891 --> 34:39.860
one in five pregnancies.

34:42.938 --> 34:45.949
So I didn't need an abortion.

34:47.568 --> 34:48.995
Oh.

34:52.156 --> 34:53.916
Could you, um...

34:54.158 --> 34:56.428
call Justin for me and
ask him to come over?

34:56.452 --> 34:57.513
Yeah.

34:57.537 --> 34:58.838
Yeah.

35:04.627 --> 35:06.053
I'm sorry.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.599
I know that you're sad, and...

35:13.261 --> 35:14.895
Well, I'm sorry.

35:15.722 --> 35:17.908
I'm not mad at you
anymore, okay, Jule?

35:17.932 --> 35:20.276
Right, sure, because
I didn't do it.

35:21.102 --> 35:22.403
No.

35:22.687 --> 35:24.238
Julia, what...?

35:24.313 --> 35:27.033
Go away, Claud, okay?

35:27.942 --> 35:29.910
I can't do this with
you now, and...

35:31.195 --> 35:32.881
I can't... look at you

35:32.905 --> 35:34.717
because I know what you
really think of me.

35:34.741 --> 35:36.167
No, you don't.

35:36.993 --> 35:38.836
You don't know what I think.

35:40.079 --> 35:41.932
I don't think anything
bad about you, Julia.

35:41.956 --> 35:43.632
I promise I don't.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.769
Look, I mean, I want to do
something nice for you.

35:45.793 --> 35:47.521
Not now, okay?

35:47.545 --> 35:48.605
Why not?

35:48.629 --> 35:50.733
Look, Claud, I'm...

35:50.757 --> 35:53.851
I'm not trying to make
you feel bad, okay?

35:54.010 --> 35:57.239
I don't have the energy to worry
about you feeling guilty, and...

35:57.263 --> 35:59.450
none of this really
matters right now.

35:59.474 --> 36:00.733
I just need...

36:05.521 --> 36:07.823
Did they let Charlie
go in with you?

36:10.735 --> 36:14.538
But there was a nurse,
and she held my hand.

36:14.822 --> 36:18.334
Told my about some trip
she'd taken to Hawaii.

36:18.785 --> 36:21.379
The airline lost her luggage.

36:21.704 --> 36:22.931
Really?

36:22.955 --> 36:24.099
- God, it's...
- No.

36:24.123 --> 36:25.674
No, she was nice.

36:26.292 --> 36:28.719
It helped, listening
to her chatter.

36:31.297 --> 36:33.140
You know, I wanted to be there.

36:34.008 --> 36:35.611
I would have been there
if you had let me.

36:35.635 --> 36:36.612
I know.

36:36.636 --> 36:38.238
Justin, there
wasn't enough time.

36:38.262 --> 36:39.656
Yeah, but I mean,
even if there was,

36:39.680 --> 36:41.200
you wouldn't have called me.

36:41.224 --> 36:45.111
I mean... you didn't
even call afterwards.

36:45.186 --> 36:46.080
Bailey was the one...

36:46.104 --> 36:47.539
I told him to tell
you to come over,

36:47.563 --> 36:49.532
not to tell you what happened.

36:50.274 --> 36:53.077
That was a mistake.
I'm... I'm sorry.

36:56.656 --> 36:59.875
I haven't been very fair to
you through all this, have I?

37:02.036 --> 37:04.547
Or nice, even.

37:05.790 --> 37:07.883
I'm sorry about that too.

37:08.584 --> 37:09.760
Well...

37:12.088 --> 37:15.933
I keep trying to figure
out... I keep thinking...

37:16.092 --> 37:21.021
maybe this wouldn't be so
bad if we were sharing it.

37:24.016 --> 37:27.528
I mean, can't we at
least share it now?

37:37.530 --> 37:38.914
Good.

37:43.286 --> 37:44.795
Julia.

37:47.331 --> 37:48.966
I'm sorry.

37:49.584 --> 37:51.552
I'm sorry. I just feel...

37:52.003 --> 37:53.679
so sad, you know?

37:55.423 --> 37:56.849
Yeah.

37:57.258 --> 37:59.894
But the fact that it
happened like this...

38:00.469 --> 38:03.272
I mean, for me, at least,

38:03.639 --> 38:07.026
there's a little,
teeny bit of relief.

38:08.394 --> 38:10.571
It kind of makes it
easier, doesn't it?

38:11.814 --> 38:13.449
Not much.

38:14.275 --> 38:16.452
No, actually.

38:17.862 --> 38:19.872
You didn't do anything, Julia.

38:21.157 --> 38:24.553
But... I-I can't act

38:24.577 --> 38:26.670
like the choice was
taken out of my hands.

38:26.996 --> 38:30.424
I mean, I would have
made the choice, Justin.

38:31.876 --> 38:35.189
It was the least worst
of a lot of bad options,

38:35.213 --> 38:36.889
and I would have done it.

38:39.759 --> 38:41.352
But you know what?

38:42.762 --> 38:44.781
No matter how it happens,

38:44.805 --> 38:48.275
I mean, any way,
it's still hard.

38:50.603 --> 38:52.029
Yeah.

38:53.814 --> 38:55.241
Yeah, it is.

39:07.203 --> 39:08.847
Did you get the one
over by the window?

39:08.871 --> 39:11.423
Uh... Yeah, got it.

39:12.124 --> 39:16.428
Wait. Oh, I think... Yes, right there.
Uh... Toss me one.

39:16.587 --> 39:19.181
Well... Damn it. We're
short a bucket.

39:20.967 --> 39:22.309
Let me see.

39:24.262 --> 39:25.396
Here.

39:30.226 --> 39:34.363
Well, now that I've ensured you won't
wash away overnight, I guess I should go.

39:36.482 --> 39:37.866
Wait a second.

39:38.693 --> 39:39.910
Listen to that.

39:41.737 --> 39:43.163
Nice.

39:46.242 --> 39:47.626
Don't go.

39:48.536 --> 39:49.846
Stay here. Why don't...?

39:49.870 --> 39:50.973
Why don't you stay over?

39:50.997 --> 39:52.933
- Bailey.
- No, nothing like that.

39:52.957 --> 39:54.174
Just...

39:54.250 --> 39:56.010
We'll just sleep.

39:56.794 --> 39:59.096
Together. We'll just... We'll
go to sleep together.

40:06.637 --> 40:10.357
Do you have a t-shirt I
could borrow or something?

40:12.560 --> 40:13.736
Yeah.

40:16.814 --> 40:18.157
Here.

40:20.818 --> 40:22.421
Could you maybe turn around?

40:22.445 --> 40:23.755
Yes.

40:23.779 --> 40:25.205
Sorry.

41:06.489 --> 41:08.332
This is nice too, huh?

41:08.449 --> 41:09.917
Hm.

41:16.624 --> 41:18.217
It's okay. I'm awake.

41:20.836 --> 41:22.304
Mind the company?

41:22.505 --> 41:23.972
No.

41:30.596 --> 41:33.107
Whoop. Sorry, was that you?

41:34.600 --> 41:36.036
Does anything hurt?

41:36.060 --> 41:37.412
Oh... No.

41:37.436 --> 41:38.904
Nothing hurts.

41:39.063 --> 41:40.739
Okay. Good.

41:42.108 --> 41:43.409
Uh...

41:45.194 --> 41:46.922
I was thinking that I
probably haven't been

41:46.946 --> 41:48.590
all that helpful
through all this.

41:48.614 --> 41:49.841
Oh, come on.

41:49.865 --> 41:51.333
No, it's true.

41:51.742 --> 41:53.345
You probably would have
been a lot better off

41:53.369 --> 41:54.795
if Mom had been here.

41:55.830 --> 41:57.808
She would have known the
exact right way to...

41:57.832 --> 41:59.550
To talk to you about
all this stuff.

42:01.043 --> 42:02.553
That is so...

42:06.757 --> 42:09.059
You're a good brother, Charlie.

42:12.471 --> 42:13.740
I don't know.

42:13.764 --> 42:15.858
You couldn't have done anything.

42:16.892 --> 42:18.829
If you had told me no,

42:18.853 --> 42:21.572
Justin and I still would
have slept with each other.

42:21.605 --> 42:24.658
So... you didn't make a mistake.

42:26.068 --> 42:28.454
I made the mistake. Only me.

42:30.698 --> 42:31.915
Well...

42:33.200 --> 42:34.793
It's over, Jule.

42:35.703 --> 42:37.838
You can kind of put
it behind you now.

42:40.082 --> 42:42.644
It's just going to take a
little time, that's all.

42:42.668 --> 42:43.645
You just have to...

42:43.669 --> 42:45.679
bear with me, okay?

42:50.259 --> 42:51.528
Well...

42:51.552 --> 42:53.228
I'm not tired, so...

42:55.347 --> 42:56.491
we can talk...

42:56.515 --> 42:59.234
- as long as you want.
- Mm.

43:02.480 --> 43:04.040
It's really pouring, huh?

43:04.064 --> 43:05.783
Oh, man.

43:06.901 --> 43:08.837
Makes me think about
how you and Claudia

43:08.861 --> 43:10.662
wouldn't sleep on
nights like this.

43:12.156 --> 43:15.177
You'd get Mom and Dad to
light a fire downstairs

43:15.201 --> 43:16.835
and make hot chocolate.

43:17.578 --> 43:18.962
Play...

43:19.705 --> 43:21.057
What's the name of
that game again?

43:21.081 --> 43:22.883
Chutes and ladders.

43:23.167 --> 43:24.760
For like hours.

43:26.337 --> 43:28.430
Should we see if anybody's
up for that tonight?

43:28.756 --> 43:30.140
Hm.

43:30.466 --> 43:32.935
Think I might be too
old for that now.

43:33.511 --> 43:35.771
Yeah, I guess so.

43:37.097 --> 43:38.690
Too bad, huh?

43:38.933 --> 43:40.234
Really.
