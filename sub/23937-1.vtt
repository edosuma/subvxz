00:17.851 --> 00:21.787
Woman: Danny, don't splash me!
[Laughs]

00:21.788 --> 00:22.855
Stop. I'm getting wet.

00:22.856 --> 00:26.659
- Man: That's the idea.
- [Woman giggling]

00:27.494 --> 00:29.261
- Woman: Stop it.
- Hi, sweetie.

00:29.262 --> 00:30.496
Man: Oh, come on!

00:30.497 --> 00:32.464
Come on, let's go
back to my place.

00:32.465 --> 00:34.066
Woman: Maybe we should wait.

00:34.067 --> 00:35.969
Man: Wait, schmait!

00:37.670 --> 00:39.204
These two people
are not married,

00:39.205 --> 00:41.540
and they're going to
have premarital sex.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.208
You could go to hell for that.

00:43.209 --> 00:44.777
All right, that's it.
You're not allowed

00:44.778 --> 00:46.412
to watch this show anymore.

00:46.413 --> 00:49.214
It inspires urges that are...

00:49.215 --> 00:52.618
- Wrong and bad.
- Woman: Let's go to your place.

00:52.619 --> 00:53.386
Man: Groovy!

00:53.387 --> 00:55.588
You could go to hell
for those urges.

00:59.325 --> 01:01.794
In hell, there is a fire

01:01.795 --> 01:05.831
that will lap at you
for all eternity.

01:05.832 --> 01:07.766
You gotta decide...

01:07.767 --> 01:12.571
Do you want to go to heaven,
or do you wanna go to hell?

01:12.572 --> 01:14.239

01:16.409 --> 01:19.611
Yeah. You a bad girl? Huh?
You a bad girl?

01:19.612 --> 01:21.213
- I'm a bad girl.
- Yeah!

01:21.214 --> 01:23.782
You're a dirty little slut, huh?
Dirty little slut,

01:23.783 --> 01:24.983
- yeah.
- Um, yes.

01:24.984 --> 01:25.952
Say it. Say you're a dirty slut.

01:25.953 --> 01:29.089
- I'm a dirty slut.
- Yeah, you're a dirty slut!

01:29.856 --> 01:33.093
[Groaning]

01:38.531 --> 01:40.900
Oh. Hmm.

01:41.234 --> 01:44.537
Hmm. Hmm.

01:45.004 --> 01:46.473
Okay.

01:46.906 --> 01:48.308
Oh.

01:48.741 --> 01:50.176
[Sighs]

01:51.911 --> 01:52.479
Mm.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.980
Why do you always call
me a dirty little slut?

01:54.981 --> 01:56.014
Ah.

01:56.015 --> 01:58.417
Come on. You love it.

01:58.418 --> 02:00.119
I like having sex on a bed.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.454
Is this because maybe
you're, uh, you're jealous

02:02.455 --> 02:03.755
that I'm more
successful than you?

02:03.756 --> 02:05.090
- [Door knocking]
- Man: Mr. Brock,

02:05.091 --> 02:06.091
we're ready for you onstage.

02:06.092 --> 02:09.394
Peter, you have been in one
great movie after another.

02:09.395 --> 02:11.230
Walk me through your process.

02:11.231 --> 02:13.299
How do you prepare for this?

02:13.566 --> 02:16.135
I tell you, I play a
lot of action heroes.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.036
Um...

02:17.037 --> 02:18.670
And in those... in those movies,

02:18.671 --> 02:21.206
I have heavy artillery.
I have guns,

02:21.207 --> 02:22.642
okay?

02:23.476 --> 02:25.612
I have a gun on me right now.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.813
Not physically, in
the physical sense.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.215
I put it on the table earlier.
It's right here.

02:30.216 --> 02:31.316
Imagine it, okay?

02:31.317 --> 02:34.253
- It's an emotional gun for me.
- Right.

02:34.254 --> 02:35.922
This gun's here...

02:36.156 --> 02:36.890
All the time.

02:36.891 --> 02:39.825
Sometimes I put it in my pocket,
sometimes I put it in my...

02:39.826 --> 02:41.593
That's how I prepare.
I'm always ready.

02:41.594 --> 02:44.796
I'm always the action hero.
Bang! Not real.

02:44.797 --> 02:46.332
But real.

02:46.466 --> 02:48.133
- Man: Uh...
- I'll do it.

02:48.134 --> 02:49.601
Don't do it.

02:49.602 --> 02:50.370
I won't do it.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.137
You've been doing this for
years, and years and years.

02:52.138 --> 02:54.439
Certainly, you've heard some
of the talk on the streets.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.775
People say that Peter
is just a tough guy,

02:56.776 --> 02:59.478
a hard guy to work with. How
do you respond to that?

02:59.479 --> 03:03.782
Yeah, Napoleon died exiled on
an island of... of leprosy.

03:03.783 --> 03:04.816
That's... that's true.

03:04.817 --> 03:05.851
- That's history.
- Man: Yeah.

03:05.852 --> 03:09.098
Jesus died on the
cross, you know?

03:09.122 --> 03:10.689
Um, visionaries die

03:10.690 --> 03:13.692
sometimes quicker
than non-visionaries.

03:13.693 --> 03:14.527
You're a visionary?

03:14.528 --> 03:15.794
Peter: Thank you. But
I'm not saying...

03:15.795 --> 03:17.262
- Oh, you're asking. I think...
- It was a question.

03:17.263 --> 03:19.631
Um, I think that's up for
kinda the press to decide,

03:19.632 --> 03:20.600
and I think that bloggers,

03:20.601 --> 03:22.601
and people who write
physical magazines

03:22.602 --> 03:23.902
have said I was a...
a visionary.

03:23.903 --> 03:25.604
People have... Have
tweeted me about that.

03:25.605 --> 03:27.206
You know, you made
bros before hos.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.473
Why don't you make
the female version?

03:28.474 --> 03:30.542
I... I wrote a great script.
It's called chicks before dicks.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.344
- Did you read it?
- Uh, look, boo boo,

03:32.345 --> 03:33.712
you have all the talent.
You really do.

03:33.713 --> 03:34.880
And I'm the one
that discovered you

03:34.881 --> 03:36.248
and gave you your
big break, right?

03:36.249 --> 03:37.282
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I promoted you

03:37.283 --> 03:38.984
- to be my d girl, right?
- I want to be a writer.

03:38.985 --> 03:40.686
I know you want to be a
writer, and in due time.

03:40.687 --> 03:43.355
Really. Your writing is great.
It's fresh and very unique.

03:43.356 --> 03:44.389
But you're bogging yourself down

03:44.390 --> 03:46.191
talking about stupid shit.
You know what? You...

03:46.192 --> 03:48.393
Nobody wants to hear about
women's stories, all right?

03:48.394 --> 03:50.329
If you want to make a film,
you got to talk about a man.

03:50.330 --> 03:51.897
You gotta write about a man.
That's what you have to do.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.832
Well, can you read my script?
It's called the year of my yoni.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.601
It's about a woman who
goes on a spiritual quest

03:55.602 --> 03:57.569
to find happiness and to
learn about her yoni.

03:57.570 --> 03:58.770
Yoni? I don't even
know what that is.

03:58.771 --> 04:00.372
Is that, like, a new way
of saying "vagina"?

04:00.373 --> 04:01.773
It sounds like a porno.
I'm not into it.

04:01.774 --> 04:04.810
Look, a guy bashing
another guy's skull in

04:04.811 --> 04:07.614
with a baseball bat,
that's what sells.

04:09.015 --> 04:11.483
Well, I could change the title
to the ultra-violent yoni.

04:11.484 --> 04:13.785
You know, that's a good start.
You could put more violence

04:13.786 --> 04:14.987
in your script,
that'd definitely get

04:14.988 --> 04:16.321
a better chance of
getting it made. Um,

04:16.322 --> 04:18.123
on my end, I'm gonna put
more female characters

04:18.124 --> 04:19.725
- in my next script.
- Really?

04:19.726 --> 04:22.027
Yeah, uh, it's called
kill the sluts.

04:22.028 --> 04:23.161
Uh, I'm gonna pick a title

04:23.162 --> 04:24.329
that's more PC a
little bit later.

04:24.330 --> 04:26.365
That's a working title.
But basically, uh,

04:26.366 --> 04:28.967
the movie's about this
crazy psychopathic killer

04:28.968 --> 04:29.968
that goes on a killing rampage

04:29.969 --> 04:31.103
and kills all these
teenage sluts.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.038
But the only person
that he can't kill

04:33.039 --> 04:34.506
is an 18-year-old virgin.

04:34.507 --> 04:37.075
Don't you think that'll send
out a weird message to women

04:37.076 --> 04:38.810
and teenage girls about sex?
And those women

04:38.811 --> 04:40.445
might grow up and
have a lot of issues.

04:40.446 --> 04:41.980
I'm not saying I'm
against women's rights.

04:41.981 --> 04:43.715
I'm just saying that
there's no market

04:43.716 --> 04:45.083
for their films.

to the person next to you,

could do a three-way?

taking the class.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.043
I liked my boobs.

08:05.384 --> 08:06.485
- Mm!
- Wow.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.855
Yeah. This is a powerful
exercise to release the shame

08:09.856 --> 08:12.624
that we carry in
our sexual organs.

- What's color therapy?
- Oh!

It's about how certain
colors make you feel.

19:19.124 --> 19:21.126
Come on. You've got to try this.

19:21.793 --> 19:23.295
Come on.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.398
- Mm. Yum.
- Yeah? Right?

19:27.399 --> 19:28.933
- Delicious. [Chuckles]
- Yeah.

19:28.934 --> 19:30.868
It's straight from the
plate to your face.

19:30.869 --> 19:32.303
Wow, it's so much
better this way.

19:32.304 --> 19:34.906
It is, absolutely. I'm
gonna join you down here.

19:34.907 --> 19:37.208
Mm! Oh, it's so good! Mm!

19:37.209 --> 19:38.910
Candy: [Panting] I love you.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.244
Man: I love you.

19:40.245 --> 19:42.447
[Panting]

19:42.648 --> 19:44.316
You know I don't...

19:44.616 --> 19:45.950
Want a relationship, right?

19:45.951 --> 19:47.285
You knew that, though, right?
[Chuckles]

19:47.286 --> 19:48.986
- That's just... that's just...
- [Laughs] Wait.

19:48.987 --> 19:52.123
Well, aren't we already
actually having a relationship?

19:52.124 --> 19:53.724
- I mean...
- I mean, if you wanna...

19:53.725 --> 19:54.926
we've been dating for two years

19:54.927 --> 19:56.127
and you just told
me you loved me.

19:56.128 --> 20:00.765
Oh, yeah, well, you know, i...
Yeah, I love you, you know, i...

20:00.766 --> 20:04.902
I love you as a sister, you
know, as a friend, and...

20:04.903 --> 20:07.538
As... as a sexual partner, uh...

20:07.539 --> 20:10.174
As... as a fellow human
being, you know?

20:10.175 --> 20:12.977
But I think we should just find
a new and better way to...

20:12.978 --> 20:14.745
To do relationships.

20:14.746 --> 20:17.481
- You know?
- Yeah. [Chuckles]

20:17.482 --> 20:18.549
[Chuckles]

20:18.550 --> 20:20.251
- Right?
- Okay.

20:20.252 --> 20:23.354
Oh. Shit. Babe, I got to...
I got to go, actually,

20:23.355 --> 20:27.391
'cause I have a... I just...
I just got a crazy week.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.726
Oh, can I also, uh...

20:28.727 --> 20:33.541
Babe, can i... can I leave that,
uh, my laundry here and, uh...

20:33.565 --> 20:35.410
Get it on Thursday?

20:35.434 --> 20:39.437
You want me to do your laundry
while you date other women?

20:39.438 --> 20:42.073
That's... I mean, that would
be really insensitive

20:42.074 --> 20:44.075
if we were in some
old-fashioned,

20:44.076 --> 20:45.376
you know, closed-minded...

20:45.377 --> 20:47.311
Relationship, but since
we're not, you know,

20:47.312 --> 20:49.814
we're... we're, uh, we're
not confining ourselves

20:49.815 --> 20:51.749
to societal norms,
then I think...

20:51.750 --> 20:54.085
I think it's fine. Yeah.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.797
All right.

20:55.821 --> 20:56.954
Bye.

20:56.955 --> 21:00.125
[Music playing]

21:04.463 --> 21:07.598
Hey. Um, me again. Listen,

21:07.599 --> 21:08.433
I was just gonna say

21:08.434 --> 21:12.136
why don't you just ignore those
previous voicemails, okay?

21:12.137 --> 21:12.938
Because... [sighs]

21:12.939 --> 21:15.840
Here's... here's the
real truth, okay?

21:15.841 --> 21:17.509
Let's get honest.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.310
I am great.

21:19.311 --> 21:20.911
I'm great. I'm so great.

21:20.912 --> 21:25.616
And I'm super-happy
for you and chandra.

21:25.617 --> 21:26.884
And here's the thing,

21:26.885 --> 21:29.186
I'm so happy! I'm so
happy and I'm great.

21:29.187 --> 21:32.223
Like, if great were people,
I'd be, like, fucking...

21:32.224 --> 21:33.758
Where is there a lot of people?
India?

21:33.759 --> 21:39.164
Beijing? I'm fucking Beijing.
That's how great I am.

21:39.564 --> 21:41.832
So I saved one of your
messages that you left me,

21:41.833 --> 21:43.067
you know, right when
you were, like,

21:43.068 --> 21:44.802
"hey, by the way, I'm
fucking a 19-year-old."

21:44.803 --> 21:47.371
It's such a great message.
It's so amazing.

21:47.372 --> 21:50.574
I'm so glad you told me
things on a voicemail.

21:50.575 --> 21:51.575
You are so brave.

21:51.576 --> 21:53.878
And by "brave," I mean, like,

21:53.879 --> 21:54.912
you're a fucking idiot.

21:54.913 --> 21:55.881
I just wanted you to know that.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.882
I saved it, and I play
it for my friends.

21:57.883 --> 21:59.383
And we laugh and laugh.

21:59.384 --> 22:02.120
And then I tell them
about your weird dick.

22:02.254 --> 22:04.755
And I'm fucking naked.

22:04.756 --> 22:05.624
And I have on... [groans]

22:05.625 --> 22:08.225
I have on those...
High-heel, like,

22:08.226 --> 22:10.294
fuck-me pumps that you love.

22:10.295 --> 22:12.330
Oh, yeah, I'm naked.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.597
Mm. You know what else?

22:13.598 --> 22:16.734
Remember that time you told me
to squeeze your dick really hard

22:16.735 --> 22:18.169
at the base of it?

22:18.170 --> 22:20.304
I'm fucking doing that...

22:20.305 --> 22:23.475
And you don't... Yeah,
and it's awesome.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.479
So, baby, call me.

22:30.916 --> 22:34.352
'Cause I could suck your cock.
[Sobbing]

22:34.353 --> 22:36.554
I really think you
should come over,

22:36.555 --> 22:38.856
'cause I might do
something bad to myself.

22:38.857 --> 22:42.426
Oh, my god, I might do
something so bad, and then...

22:42.427 --> 22:43.594
I mean, I don't know
what I would do,

22:43.595 --> 22:46.030
but it would be bad, and
then you would feel guilty,

22:46.031 --> 22:48.332
like, for the rest of your life.

22:48.333 --> 22:49.533
So...

22:49.534 --> 22:53.572
I can't wait to hear from you.
Okay.

22:53.739 --> 22:55.340
Bye!

22:55.941 --> 22:59.211
[Music playing]

23:03.749 --> 23:05.326
Wow.

23:05.350 --> 23:07.285
This is amazing.

23:10.155 --> 23:12.691
[Music playing]

23:17.996 --> 23:21.133
- Is this all your art?
- Oh, yeah.

23:21.566 --> 23:22.800
See...

23:22.801 --> 23:26.347
Our society is sick, yeah?

23:26.371 --> 23:29.407
[Sighs] It's no wonder
the earth is dying,

23:29.408 --> 23:33.177
'cause the culture sends
its message, yeah?

23:33.178 --> 23:35.079
Join the rat race. Make money.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.847
Be a winner, otherwise
you're nothing.

23:36.848 --> 23:40.351
It's read us weekly.
Drink the kool-aid.

23:40.352 --> 23:41.719
Fuck that shit.

23:41.720 --> 23:45.600
I'm my own man. I mean,
sure, got to make money.

23:45.624 --> 23:47.758
But I don't let them own me

23:47.759 --> 23:50.295
by seeking their approval, yeah?

23:51.062 --> 23:53.465
I'm free. [Gasps]

23:53.865 --> 23:56.067
Why I chose the name freedom.

23:56.168 --> 23:57.869
Okay.

23:59.704 --> 24:01.807
[Breathing heavily]

24:03.508 --> 24:06.278
I don't go to exercise
classes, you know?

24:06.912 --> 24:08.546
I do my own thing.

24:08.547 --> 24:09.980
[Panting]

24:09.981 --> 24:11.749
Why follow the man?

24:11.750 --> 24:13.784
I create my own moves

24:13.785 --> 24:17.421
I don't need someone to give them to me.
[Chuckles]

24:17.422 --> 24:20.458
Well, yoga exercises are
thousands of years old

24:20.459 --> 24:22.594
for a reason. They really work.

24:28.567 --> 24:31.603
Why don't you let
the man out of you?

24:33.538 --> 24:35.841
Why don't you go your own way...

24:36.508 --> 24:39.344
Instead of trying
to please people?

24:42.781 --> 24:46.017
[Music playing]

24:56.761 --> 24:59.331
Are you gonna keep
doing those moves?

24:59.998 --> 25:01.500
Oh, yeah.

25:15.213 --> 25:17.549
- Darren: Eva?
- [Door knocking]

25:20.719 --> 25:22.086
Shit.

25:22.087 --> 25:23.755
Are you in there?

25:28.159 --> 25:29.661
Hi.

25:30.862 --> 25:31.696
Fuck-me pumps, huh?

25:31.697 --> 25:34.164
Eva: Uh, they're upstairs.
You want me to get them?

25:34.165 --> 25:35.599
No. That's okay.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.368
I took them off 'cause
they hurt my feet.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.905
- Mm-hmm.
- You put on the sweats.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.873
I was worried, obviously.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.108
So many messages.

25:44.109 --> 25:45.043
You were worried about me?

25:45.044 --> 25:48.512
Well... 14 messages and
some suicide threats.

25:48.513 --> 25:52.751
I never said suicide. I said,
"maybe something bad."

25:53.418 --> 25:57.255
And that you would die alone.
You're not gonna die alone.

25:57.622 --> 25:59.023
But if you do...

25:59.024 --> 26:01.526
It's because of doing
things like this.

26:02.294 --> 26:04.295
You look really nice.

26:04.296 --> 26:05.829
Thank you. I'm gonna go.

26:05.830 --> 26:08.098
It's chandra's birthday.
We're doing a thing.

26:08.099 --> 26:10.334
[Gasps] It's her birthday?

26:10.335 --> 26:12.436
Oh, wait, I have a
question for you.

26:12.437 --> 26:15.039
- Mm-hmm.
- Like, where was chandra...

26:15.040 --> 26:17.775
When I was putting you
through art school?

26:17.776 --> 26:19.143
Oh, my god! That's right!

26:19.144 --> 26:20.244
Here comes the flood.

26:20.245 --> 26:21.278
- Oh, my god!
- Here it is.

26:21.279 --> 26:23.180
- She was in kindergarten. Yay!
- We are doing this.

26:23.181 --> 26:25.649
Well, guess what, Eva, I could
never keep up with you,

26:25.650 --> 26:27.518
'cause all you ever
cared about was money.

26:27.519 --> 26:29.019
You're a fucking liar,

26:29.020 --> 26:30.688
because I don't
care about money.

26:30.689 --> 26:33.591
I put you through art school.
You're just like... what?

26:33.592 --> 26:35.492
What do you even
do for a living?

26:35.493 --> 26:36.461
You drive a douchebag car.

26:36.462 --> 26:38.729
I wanted a much
douchier car than that.

26:38.730 --> 26:40.130
That was the one
we could afford.

26:40.131 --> 26:42.132
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have said that.

26:42.133 --> 26:44.034
I don't like you right now.

26:44.035 --> 26:45.469
I love you...

26:45.470 --> 26:48.106
Somewhat. But right now...

26:48.373 --> 26:50.307
I don't think you would
like you, either,

26:50.308 --> 26:52.320
'cause you're being horrible...

26:52.344 --> 26:53.878
And you look...

26:54.212 --> 26:54.879
Horrible.

26:54.880 --> 26:58.416
[Sobbing] I just
wanted to have a baby!

26:58.650 --> 27:00.251
Okay. Come here.

27:01.086 --> 27:03.253
Come here. Come here.

27:03.254 --> 27:04.388
- Hi. Hi.
- Don't, don't, don't.

27:04.389 --> 27:06.857
No, don't make it a thing.
Don't make it a thing.

27:06.858 --> 27:09.303
Oh, my god, you smell so weird.

27:09.327 --> 27:10.861
- You smell so good.
- No, just don't.

27:10.862 --> 27:14.331
Don't humiliate yourself
anymore than you have, okay?

27:14.332 --> 27:15.200
You smell like...

27:15.201 --> 27:17.835
- I don't know, like, lavender...
- Okay. Just stop. Just stop.

27:17.836 --> 27:19.136
Don't embarrass yourself...

27:19.137 --> 27:21.805
- Anymore.
- You don't embarrass yourself,

27:21.806 --> 27:23.507
buddy. You settle down.

27:23.508 --> 27:25.843
- What's happening down there?
- Don't. Don't.

27:25.844 --> 27:27.979
- We're not.
- [Sighs] Okay.

27:29.147 --> 27:31.882
Brew up some coffee.
Don't. Please.

27:31.883 --> 27:35.119
I care very deeply about
you without loving you.

27:35.120 --> 27:38.088
Throw up, go to
sleep, take a shower.

27:38.089 --> 27:39.791
I already threw up.

27:41.526 --> 27:43.661
[Sobbing] I love you so much.

27:43.662 --> 27:46.130
Bye. Thank you for coming!

27:46.131 --> 27:49.200
[Honey moaning]

27:53.405 --> 27:56.540
The only reason a
man and a woman

27:56.541 --> 27:59.309
should have carnal
knowledge of each other...

27:59.310 --> 28:00.978
Is to create a child.

28:00.979 --> 28:02.513
[Honey moaning]

28:02.514 --> 28:04.314
Any other physical union

28:04.315 --> 28:08.062
between a man and a woman...

28:08.086 --> 28:09.954
Is a sin.

28:10.088 --> 28:13.090
[Moaning]

28:13.091 --> 28:15.159
And sins are punishable

28:15.160 --> 28:17.861
by hellfire and damnation.

28:17.862 --> 28:18.730
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

28:18.731 --> 28:22.199
- You will go to hell!
- Honey: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.836
I'm sorry. [Moaning]

28:25.737 --> 28:27.272
You all right?

28:28.673 --> 28:31.910
- Did I just say that out loud?
- Yeah.

28:33.812 --> 28:34.512
It felt so good.

28:34.513 --> 28:37.391
It felt like I was
doing something wrong.

28:37.415 --> 28:38.916
I'm fucked up.

28:38.917 --> 28:40.951
I don't think you're fucked up.

28:40.952 --> 28:43.455
- You don't?
- No.

28:44.022 --> 28:46.091
I think you're divine.

28:47.325 --> 28:49.260
Divinity itself...

28:49.394 --> 28:51.329
In a physical form.

28:51.730 --> 28:54.031
- Really?
- Yeah.

28:54.032 --> 28:56.768
[Music playing]

29:09.447 --> 29:12.349
I thought I knew what sex
and orgasms were before,

29:12.350 --> 29:13.118
but I did not.

29:13.119 --> 29:15.552
I feel like I understand
the meaning of life now,

29:15.553 --> 29:17.287
and the meaning of life
is to have as much sex

29:17.288 --> 29:21.225
as possible with this guy
over and over again.

29:21.226 --> 29:23.060
Oh! Great sex!

29:23.061 --> 29:24.595
Oh, it makes you
do stupid things.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.797
I feel like I tried to please
the guy so much before

29:26.798 --> 29:29.801
that I never, like,
really got off.

29:30.301 --> 29:31.869
Darren would just... [sighs]

29:31.870 --> 29:34.938
Jam it in there without
a lot of warm-up.

29:34.939 --> 29:36.507
And that was on the
rare occasions

29:36.508 --> 29:38.910
that he could get it up. [Sighs]

29:39.177 --> 29:39.878
This is your ex?

29:39.879 --> 29:41.411
You know what? People say

41:32.690 --> 41:36.026
Um... I would like to
keep my clothes on.

41:36.360 --> 41:37.927
If you just...

41:37.928 --> 41:39.762
Uh... god, you're...

41:39.763 --> 41:41.164
Um... oh, my god! Wait!

41:41.165 --> 41:44.634
Wait a second! That's...
Oh, my god! [Chuckles]

41:44.635 --> 41:47.403
Oh, my god! You're
so good at this!

41:47.404 --> 41:49.038
I've wanted to do
this since I met you.

41:49.039 --> 41:51.374
That's what you were
thinking the whole time...

41:51.375 --> 41:54.143
When we met at Walmart?
Are you kidding me?

41:54.144 --> 41:55.612
- Mm.
- That's kind of weird.

41:55.613 --> 41:58.781
Thank you for telling me,
'cause I was, like, thinking,

41:58.782 --> 42:00.984
"oh, nice guy at Walmart.

42:00.985 --> 42:04.020
He... he buys, like, stuff in bulk.
I get it."

42:04.021 --> 42:07.323
Oh. Uh... oh, my god. Oh, god.

42:07.324 --> 42:09.392
Oh, god. And I then was, like,

42:09.393 --> 42:10.627
"hey, you drive a prius.

42:10.628 --> 42:13.329
And that's cool. You
know, cool person."

42:13.330 --> 42:14.131
Hey, what... what...

42:14.132 --> 42:17.433
Just slow down on that bottom part.
Oh, my god.

42:17.434 --> 42:18.668
Shut up. I'm gonna
stop talking now.

42:18.669 --> 42:23.007
I'm not gonna talk anymore.
I'm not gonna talk anymore.

42:23.541 --> 42:25.241
[Moaning]

42:25.242 --> 42:26.876
You're, like, really
good at this.

42:26.877 --> 42:29.045
Oh, god. Wait, I didn't groom.
I didn't groom!

42:29.046 --> 42:31.180
Ah! Okay, okay, no, actually,
I'm okay with that.

42:31.181 --> 42:34.350
I'm okay with it. Never mind.
Don't listen to me. Don't stop.

42:34.351 --> 42:36.719
Don't stop. [Giggling]

42:36.720 --> 42:39.490
[Moaning]

42:40.090 --> 42:42.226
[Music playing]

42:42.993 --> 42:44.728
I want love.

42:48.499 --> 42:51.936
[Music playing]

42:53.637 --> 42:54.771
Babe?

42:54.772 --> 42:57.473
Do you have, uh, that bag?
I'm doing that lecture

42:57.474 --> 43:00.276
on techno-social wormholes
downtown, and they're, uh...

43:00.277 --> 43:02.478
They're gonna put it on YouTube.

43:02.479 --> 43:04.248
Isn't that great?

43:05.583 --> 43:08.161
I didn't have time
to do your laundry.

43:08.185 --> 43:09.653
And...

43:11.155 --> 43:14.658
If you want to be with me,
you can't date anybody else.

43:15.392 --> 43:17.360
Have you noticed that I'm great?

43:17.361 --> 43:18.728
'Cause you don't
treat me that way.

43:18.729 --> 43:21.497
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where's
all this coming from?

43:21.498 --> 43:22.532
It's coming from me.

43:22.533 --> 43:26.203
But you were fine with
everything a few days ago.

43:26.537 --> 43:28.004
I take care of you.

43:28.005 --> 43:29.539
When are you gonna
take care of me?

43:29.540 --> 43:32.542
Relationships are hard for me.
My parents got divorced.

43:32.543 --> 43:33.477
Oh, god! Stop it!

43:33.478 --> 43:36.813
Stop using that as an
excuse for everything!

43:36.814 --> 43:39.950
My family was fucked up, too!
Let it go!

43:40.150 --> 43:43.920
I don't really like your tone
of voice right now, honestly.

43:43.921 --> 43:45.855
You need to figure that out.

43:45.856 --> 43:49.627
Uh, well, those don't
look very clean to me.

43:50.327 --> 43:51.762
No.

43:52.062 --> 43:54.031
They're very dirty.

43:54.264 --> 43:56.266
- What?
- Yeah.

43:56.734 --> 43:57.767
Extremely dirty.

43:57.768 --> 44:00.203
- And smelly!
- Babe, seriously?

44:00.204 --> 44:01.270
[Grunts] You know,
you're gonna...

44:01.271 --> 44:02.705
You're gonna regret
this tomorrow.

44:02.706 --> 44:05.475
And... and when you do,
you can call me, okay?

44:05.476 --> 44:10.146
When you are ready to treat me
like the amazing person I am,

44:10.147 --> 44:13.317
you call me! I won't
be calling you.

44:14.284 --> 44:15.785
Take that!

44:15.786 --> 44:18.187
I was gonna wear this.
I was gonna wear this.

44:18.188 --> 44:21.557
Now it's even more dirty.
It's more dirty now.

44:21.558 --> 44:23.193
Pussy!

44:24.561 --> 44:26.529
[Music playing]

44:26.530 --> 44:29.967
And, uh, where am I
gonna clean these?

44:30.567 --> 44:32.269
Do you have a place?

44:32.569 --> 44:36.005
Okay, you know what? Thank you.
Thank you. That's great.

44:36.006 --> 44:37.507
Okay, we'll... we'll talk.

44:37.508 --> 44:39.609
The guy shows her the
beauty of her own soul

44:39.610 --> 44:43.312
through sexuality, and then
she defeats the killer.

44:43.313 --> 44:44.614
- [Sighs]
- Hmm. Well, I'm not sure

44:44.615 --> 44:46.282
how to fit that into a
teenage slasher film,

44:46.283 --> 44:49.853
but I like the challenge. I'm
gonna get cracking on it.

44:50.054 --> 44:52.255
Peter: Don't shoot the dinosaur.
He's on your side.

44:52.256 --> 44:53.090
What are you guys doing?

44:53.091 --> 44:54.891
We're working on a video
game based on the film.

44:54.892 --> 44:57.860
Yeah, it's really gonna boost
our profits on this one.

44:57.861 --> 45:00.763
Peter came up with
it all by himself.

45:00.764 --> 45:03.132
The goal of the game is to
build up your empire...

45:03.133 --> 45:05.034
- This is my idea.
- And kill as many sluts

45:05.035 --> 45:06.569
and douchebags that
get in your way.

45:06.570 --> 45:07.371
That's is my idea.

45:07.372 --> 45:08.538
Once you reach the
higher levels,

45:08.539 --> 45:09.806
- you'll meet a virgin...
- This is my idea.

45:09.807 --> 45:11.441
- With special powers.
- My idea. My idea.

45:11.442 --> 45:13.042
Every time you see a slut,

45:13.043 --> 45:14.444
- you can kill her...
- That's my idea.

45:14.445 --> 45:15.578
- And get the points.
- My idea.

45:15.579 --> 45:18.081
Sometimes I like to shoot her
in the boobs or crotch area.

45:18.082 --> 45:20.049
- [Laughing]
- The last one was his idea.

45:20.050 --> 45:25.189
- [Screams]
- Boom! That slut went down!

45:26.323 --> 45:28.324
- So what do you think?
- [Man laughing in game]

45:28.325 --> 45:29.459
I think it's really disturbing

45:29.460 --> 45:31.928
and it makes me want to,
like, vomit in my mouth.

45:31.929 --> 45:33.996
Hey, man, I need you to
go through the video game

45:33.997 --> 45:35.231
and make sure that
all of the girls,

45:35.232 --> 45:36.966
under their shirts, you can
see their erect nipples.

45:36.967 --> 45:39.669
- I need you to do that for me.
- Great idea!

45:39.670 --> 45:40.337
So smart.

45:40.338 --> 45:42.338
Look, the script that
John and I are writing

45:42.339 --> 45:43.539
is a totally different story.

45:43.540 --> 45:45.274
Yeah, I know, and thank god
it's a different story,

45:45.275 --> 45:48.678
because your script sucked
shit, and this video game

45:48.679 --> 45:49.646
is going to sell like Molly

45:49.647 --> 45:52.014
to a girl that doesn't talk to
her parents that much, okay?

45:52.015 --> 45:53.549
I need you to be on nipple
supervision, all right?

45:53.550 --> 45:55.351
You got to go through the
video game and make sure

45:55.352 --> 45:57.386
that every girl's nipples
are erect, okay?

45:57.387 --> 45:58.988
We're gonna go for
the only demographic

45:58.989 --> 46:00.623
that matters, and
that's teenage boys.

46:00.624 --> 46:02.492
Well, that's ridiculous
because John and I

46:02.493 --> 46:03.860
are writing a great script.

46:03.861 --> 46:05.661
I'm sorry. That app is going
off that I downloaded.

46:05.662 --> 46:07.563
It keeps going off when
people say stupid shit.

46:07.564 --> 46:08.898
Uh, let me fix this.
Turn it off.

46:08.899 --> 46:12.702
[Clears throat] You want to know
what men really get off on?

46:12.703 --> 46:13.803
No.

46:13.804 --> 46:14.904
The conquest, okay?

46:14.905 --> 46:16.939
Look, I'm a hunter. We're hunters.
We're men.

46:16.940 --> 46:20.409
I'm a man. I'm a hunter, okay?
I hunted you. I got you.

46:20.410 --> 46:21.911
I found you. I kept
you for a little bit,

46:21.912 --> 46:24.714
and then I got bored, and
then you left and now I'm...

46:24.715 --> 46:27.750
I'm attracted to you again, you know?
That's what works.

46:27.751 --> 46:28.818
The plan worked, okay?

46:28.819 --> 46:32.021
So let's just go have
sex in my office.

46:32.022 --> 46:33.457
No.

46:33.824 --> 46:35.726
Everything you have is...

46:36.660 --> 46:40.029
Turn your fucking head. What's your...
what's your name?

46:40.030 --> 46:40.697
Demarcus.

46:40.698 --> 46:41.931
You're the whitest
guy in the world,

46:41.932 --> 46:46.270
and his name's fucking Demarcus.
Hey, I'm Deshawn.

46:46.570 --> 46:47.137
Anyway,

46:47.138 --> 46:51.440
every... everything you
have is because of me.

46:51.441 --> 46:53.476
But I want to be a writer.

46:53.477 --> 46:54.710
Can you just make
sure you supervise

46:54.711 --> 46:56.712
all the nipples, please?
That's what I need from you.

46:56.713 --> 47:00.117
That is, if you want to get
a paycheck, big boobs.

47:03.754 --> 47:04.488
[Sighs]

47:04.489 --> 47:07.457
"I want to be a
writer." [Mumbling]

47:08.325 --> 47:11.427
Mark was down there for so long.

47:11.428 --> 47:13.329
I wonder what he was
thinking about.

47:13.330 --> 47:16.132
- He was thinking: Yum, yum!
- [Laughing]

47:16.133 --> 47:18.000
I feel like guys who
won't go down on you

47:18.001 --> 47:18.902
aren't hetero enough.

47:18.903 --> 47:20.837
I mean, what would
they rather be doing,

47:20.838 --> 47:22.515
sucking a cock?

47:22.539 --> 47:23.373
This guy sounds amazing.

47:23.374 --> 47:24.907
You can totally tell the
difference between a guy

47:24.908 --> 47:26.609
who's into it and
a guy who's not.

47:26.610 --> 47:28.778
I didn't even know that
I liked it that much,

47:28.779 --> 47:32.182
but I haven't had sex
with a lot of people.

47:32.382 --> 47:33.350
It's good if a guy's good at it.

47:33.351 --> 47:36.786
Otherwise, it's like sandpaper
rubbing against your clitoris

47:36.787 --> 47:38.754
while you lay in a
pool of saliva.

47:38.755 --> 47:40.056
- Ah!
- Oh!

47:40.057 --> 47:41.624
Well, this guy was great at it.

47:41.625 --> 47:43.726
I think he could write
an instruction manual

47:43.727 --> 47:45.061
- on tonguemanship.
- Wow!

47:45.062 --> 47:47.964
- Did you have sex?
- I had great sex.

47:47.965 --> 47:49.932
- I had the best sex of my life.
- [Both gasp]

47:49.933 --> 47:52.368
You guys both had great
sex and I got nothing.

47:52.369 --> 47:53.303
Are you going out again?

47:53.304 --> 47:54.871
I don't know. What's the point?

47:54.872 --> 47:57.006
- Getting head!
- The best sex of your life.

47:57.007 --> 47:59.342
I can't. I just look
better with clothes on.

47:59.343 --> 48:01.277
I don't want him
to see me naked.

48:01.278 --> 48:03.012
But you let him lick
your naked vagina.

48:03.013 --> 48:05.081
I know, but that was
just one tiny section

48:05.082 --> 48:07.917
down there. And... and
I had clothes on.

48:07.918 --> 48:09.852
Plus, I work with
models all day at work,

48:09.853 --> 48:11.120
and they're in such great shape.

48:11.121 --> 48:13.623
Just... I look like
crap compared to them.

48:13.624 --> 48:15.025
You are hot!

48:15.492 --> 48:16.592
I don't know.

48:16.593 --> 48:18.227
Maybe he's too nice.

48:18.228 --> 48:20.129
I'd take nice over mean any day.

48:20.130 --> 48:22.766
Yeah, or commitment-phobic.

48:23.400 --> 48:26.235
Let's make a pact to be
with good guys only.

48:26.236 --> 48:29.439
Guys who treat us
great, like we deserve.

48:29.539 --> 48:31.575
Yeah, good-guy pact.

48:31.975 --> 48:33.542
Mark is so handsome.

48:33.543 --> 48:35.444
There must be something
wrong with him.

48:35.445 --> 48:37.380
Or maybe I just don't know
how to be with someone

48:37.381 --> 48:40.116
who's so sexually giving,
which means I like jerks,

48:40.117 --> 48:42.785
which also means I can't
be in the good-guy pact.

48:42.786 --> 48:45.087
I'm gonna light a candle
for you and Mark.

48:45.088 --> 48:46.956
Me, too. Okay.

48:46.957 --> 48:48.491
- Don't forget the pact.
- [Sighs]

48:48.492 --> 48:49.326
Good guys only.

48:49.327 --> 48:51.360
- Good guys only.
- Good guys only.

48:51.361 --> 48:53.062
- Maybe sometimes a jerk?
- No.

48:53.063 --> 48:54.897
- No.
- No? Jerk sex?

48:54.898 --> 48:57.034
- No jerk sex.
- Aw.

49:00.938 --> 49:04.441
- [Phone ringing]
- [Indistinct chatter]

49:07.177 --> 49:07.978
Oh, hey.

49:07.979 --> 49:10.646
Um, thank you for
sending me your script,

49:10.647 --> 49:13.916
the red flow. I... I
thought it was hilarious.

49:13.917 --> 49:15.952
- You read it?
- I loved it.

49:15.953 --> 49:16.953
Yeah, but will it ever be made?

49:16.954 --> 49:19.923
A movie about a girl
getting her period.

49:20.357 --> 49:21.191
Why not?

49:21.192 --> 49:23.225
You know, I really
want to write a script

49:23.226 --> 49:24.393
about my new friends.
They're, like,

49:24.394 --> 49:27.163
these modern-day witches.
They're really inspiring.

49:27.164 --> 49:29.466
Yes, witches, girl power.

49:29.833 --> 49:31.301
Do it.

49:31.935 --> 49:33.102
Have you heard about
this video game

49:33.103 --> 49:35.204
that Peter is doing?
It is so vile.

49:35.205 --> 49:36.305
Yeah, I heard about it.

49:36.306 --> 49:37.807
I wish I could destroy
the computers

49:37.808 --> 49:41.644
or make my own video game
called sluts fight back.

49:41.645 --> 49:44.347
[Chuckles] I love that.
"Sluts fight back."

49:44.348 --> 49:45.982
If I was technological,
I'd just put a virus

49:45.983 --> 49:48.851
in the whole system and
I would shut it down.

49:48.852 --> 49:50.320
Well...

49:51.688 --> 49:54.090
Well, it's funny
that you say that,

49:54.091 --> 49:56.592
'cause I happen to
be technological.

49:56.593 --> 49:59.763
[Music playing]

50:09.272 --> 50:10.606
What are you doing?

50:10.607 --> 50:13.442
- [Typing]
- Technological stuff.

- No?

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:02.799
Ugh! [Chuckles]

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:05.767
You know, I've been
thinking about you a lot.

01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:07.369
- You have?
- Yeah.

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:08.637
Why haven't you called?

01:00:08.638 --> 01:00:11.073
Well, look in my eyes.
Tell me what I'm thinking.

01:00:11.074 --> 01:00:13.542
[Chuckles] Um, I don't know.

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:15.645
No, no! [Chuckles]

01:00:16.879 --> 01:00:19.315
Talk to me. How do you feel?

01:00:20.483 --> 01:00:23.128
- I like you.
- You do?

01:00:23.152 --> 01:00:24.621
Yeah.

01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:26.556
I love you.

01:00:26.656 --> 01:00:27.624
[Gasps]

01:00:27.625 --> 01:00:29.157
I love you, yeah?

01:00:29.158 --> 01:00:31.861
Don't you know that?
Can't you tell?

01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:34.296
Sometimes I can't talk
unless I'm wasted.

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:35.797
Yeah, I get scared.

01:00:35.798 --> 01:00:38.301
I'm gonna talk to you now, yeah?

01:00:38.434 --> 01:00:39.969
I love you.

01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:42.871
Oh, I love you. [Chuckles]

01:00:42.872 --> 01:00:45.974
Do you see it in my eyes?
Yeah, can you feel it?

01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:49.244
I love you.

01:00:49.245 --> 01:00:54.150
- [Chuckles] I love you.
- I love you. Mm. Mm.

01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:59.221
I love you!

01:00:59.222 --> 01:01:01.223
- I love you!
- I love...

01:01:01.224 --> 01:01:04.426
[honey moaning]

01:01:04.427 --> 01:01:07.263
[Music playing]

01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:10.800
Oh, whoa.

01:01:10.933 --> 01:01:13.503
My heart's beating really fast.

01:01:14.303 --> 01:01:16.738
- Have you got a valium?
- No.

01:01:16.739 --> 01:01:18.875
[Panting] Xanax?

01:01:19.876 --> 01:01:21.677
- Nyquil?
- No.

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:22.811
[Panting]

01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:25.814
No, it's all right. I'll
just talk to my heart, yeah?

01:01:25.815 --> 01:01:28.350
I'll make it come down, yeah.
[Breathing heavily]

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:29.751
Do you want me to
turn the music off?

01:01:29.752 --> 01:01:31.853
No, no, no, it's fine.
No, I can...

01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:33.989
I can do it. Yeah,
I can make it.

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:35.825
Make it calm down.

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:40.395
- Do you want to have sex?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, babe, babe.

01:01:40.396 --> 01:01:42.365
Sorry. That hurts, yeah?

01:01:42.765 --> 01:01:45.501
Oh. [Panting]

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:47.969
I've never felt
that way before...

01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:50.605
- [Panting]
- The way you made me feel.

01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:52.007
Sex is beautiful.

01:01:52.008 --> 01:01:54.242
I didn't have to
feel bad about it.

01:01:54.243 --> 01:01:55.712
Okay.

01:01:55.912 --> 01:01:58.313
I felt really good about myself.

01:01:58.314 --> 01:01:59.948
No, that's great, babe, but...

01:01:59.949 --> 01:02:02.818
I don't think I can
have sex right now.

01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:04.820
Oh, god, I hope I
don't have to go

01:02:04.821 --> 01:02:06.822
to the emergency room again.

01:02:06.823 --> 01:02:08.524
Oh, my god!

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:10.792
Candy: And then I
made him lick it!

01:02:10.793 --> 01:02:12.127
And he did the whole alphabet

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:14.196
for 45 minutes. I
looked at the clock.

01:02:14.197 --> 01:02:15.997
- What?
- Oh, my god!

01:02:15.998 --> 01:02:16.899
Candy: I know!

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.134
And then I made him
do my laundry.

01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:20.769
Now I have the power.

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:23.672
Did you ask him if he's
seeing the other girls?

01:02:23.673 --> 01:02:27.175
Oh, god! No, I forgot! Ugh!

01:02:27.176 --> 01:02:29.377
Well, maybe your power
isn't very powerful,

01:02:29.378 --> 01:02:30.213
because you got him off,

01:02:30.214 --> 01:02:31.913
and you didn't get
what you wanted.

01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:33.715
Candy: My power's very powerful.

01:02:33.716 --> 01:02:35.817
Why don't you ask
for what you want?

01:02:35.818 --> 01:02:39.155
[Sighs] I try to talk to
him, but it's, like...

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:43.659
Ah! Nothing comes out.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:44.826
What is wrong with me?

01:02:44.827 --> 01:02:48.430
I mean, I can talk to you guys,
but I cannot talk to him.

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:50.632
It's like when I'm
around him, I just...

01:02:50.633 --> 01:02:53.068
He makes me so nervous
that I'm not myself.

01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:54.636
I'm like a unicorn.

01:02:54.637 --> 01:02:56.605
Everyone knows you
can't see a unicorn

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:58.507
unless you believe in them.

01:02:58.508 --> 01:03:01.409
[Sobbing] It's like
he can't see how...

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:03.545
Magic I really am.

01:03:03.546 --> 01:03:04.947
Oh!

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:08.483
Everyone can see it.
It's super obvious.

01:03:08.484 --> 01:03:10.286
Yeah.

01:03:12.488 --> 01:03:15.591
What if I ask him
for what I want...

01:03:16.926 --> 01:03:18.761
And he leaves me?

01:03:19.262 --> 01:03:20.262
You should try.

01:03:20.263 --> 01:03:22.597
Sometimes I don't even
know what I want.

01:03:22.598 --> 01:03:25.635
I think you're being
too hard on yourself.

01:03:25.902 --> 01:03:28.404
Okay, what candle did you bring?

01:03:29.739 --> 01:03:31.407
The white candle.

01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:34.143
For healing.

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:36.645
We all say...

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:38.680
"I wish to remove
anything negative

01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:40.115
from my life."

01:03:40.116 --> 01:03:42.951
All: I wish to remove
anything negative

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:44.554
from my life.

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:46.656
And so mote it be.

01:03:49.091 --> 01:03:54.630
[Music playing]

01:03:57.366 --> 01:03:59.601
Oh, and I wish for a unicorn.

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:01.069
[Chuckles]

01:04:01.070 --> 01:04:03.238
Are you dating other women?

01:04:03.239 --> 01:04:05.674
Why are you talking
in that weird voice?

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:06.675
I'm trying to sound powerful.

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.777
I thought that's what
turned you on last time.

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:10.145
Yeah, it turned me on

01:04:10.146 --> 01:04:11.379
that you asked for
what you wanted.

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:12.981
I just never knew what
you were thinking before

01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:14.950
because you just always agreed
with everything I said.

01:04:14.951 --> 01:04:17.185
Well, I don't agree with
a lot of things you say!

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:19.321
Maybe listen to me for once!

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:19.922
Okay.

01:04:19.923 --> 01:04:22.791
Stop dating other women! Are
you dating other women?

01:04:22.792 --> 01:04:26.529
Well, there are two other
women that I sometimes see.

01:04:28.297 --> 01:04:30.233
Pick me and only me.

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:33.736
I'll think about it.

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:36.771
And then she uncovers
her true erotic nature

01:04:36.772 --> 01:04:38.206
and defeats the killer
inside herself,

01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:41.476
which is really her own
self-limiting beliefs.

01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:43.478
Wow, that sounds like
a real blockbuster.

01:04:43.479 --> 01:04:44.479
Well, actually, i... I do think

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:45.947
it has potential to be
a real blockbuster,

01:04:45.948 --> 01:04:49.150
because what we've done here is we've...
we've satisfied

01:04:49.151 --> 01:04:49.986
the demands of the genre

01:04:49.987 --> 01:04:53.422
while also creating
something truly original.

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:54.923
Oh, sorry, man. I
almost fell asleep

01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:57.125
with what you're saying,
'cause it's boring as shit.

01:04:57.126 --> 01:04:58.426
Hey, do you want to have
sex in the bathroom,

01:04:58.427 --> 01:05:01.162
or do you want to reject me
like my own mother did, huh?

01:05:01.163 --> 01:05:02.364
Why did you break up with me?
Huh?

01:05:02.365 --> 01:05:04.599
Why did you break up with me? All
I wanted to do was love you,

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.369
and mentor you, and help you
achieve your true potential.

01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:09.104
I'm sorry. I don't
know what to say.

01:05:09.105 --> 01:05:10.171
I hate that you're not into me.

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:11.439
It makes me so much
more attracted to you.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.174
And I thought you were
desperate and too old

01:05:13.175 --> 01:05:14.776
to bear children
without birth defects.

01:05:14.777 --> 01:05:16.511
Oh, that's so out of line.

01:05:16.512 --> 01:05:17.946
I'm so relieved that you
find me attractive,

01:05:17.947 --> 01:05:20.148
but when can Linda read
the script that we wrote?

01:05:20.149 --> 01:05:23.084
I don't want you speaking
directly to Linda anymore,

01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:25.654
okay? And here's another
piece of advice for you,

01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:27.522
uh, your boobs are
too big, okay?

01:05:27.523 --> 01:05:28.823
They're too big and
they're flopping around,

01:05:28.824 --> 01:05:30.258
and they make you look
like a bimbo, all right?

01:05:30.259 --> 01:05:33.328
You look like a dummy. That's
why your directing career

01:05:33.329 --> 01:05:34.496
hasn't gotten off
the ground yet,

01:05:34.497 --> 01:05:35.830
'cause you look like
a big-boobied dummy.

01:05:35.831 --> 01:05:38.400
Well, that's great advice.
Should I cut my boobs off

01:05:38.401 --> 01:05:39.567
- so I can seem smarter?
- No,

01:05:39.568 --> 01:05:42.037
you shouldn't cut
your boobs off, okay?

01:05:42.038 --> 01:05:42.972
But what you could do is,

01:05:42.973 --> 01:05:44.539
you could mash them down a little bit.
You could take...

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:48.376
You know what you could do? You
could saran wrap them, okay?

01:05:48.377 --> 01:05:50.779
I do it to my dick when I'm
on vacation in France.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.381
I got a big dick and it
fucking goes right here

01:05:53.382 --> 01:05:55.117
and I tape it here.

01:05:57.787 --> 01:06:01.823
My bodacious ta-tas honor
me and they honor you.

01:06:01.824 --> 01:06:03.258
Should I be taking notes
on some of this stuff

01:06:03.259 --> 01:06:05.593
for the sexual-harassment
lawsuit we're all going to?

01:06:05.594 --> 01:06:09.764
Hey, don't make me load my
emotional gun, okay, dude?

01:06:09.765 --> 01:06:10.599
'Cause I'm one step away

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.302
from loading this
emotional gun, dude.

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:15.104
Cool.

01:06:16.706 --> 01:06:18.940
That dress looks
so great on you.

01:06:18.941 --> 01:06:20.342
Why are you going out
with Darren again?

01:06:20.343 --> 01:06:22.143
Honey: You should be going
out with the licker. I mean,

01:06:22.144 --> 01:06:24.212
there's no contest.
You either get licked

01:06:24.213 --> 01:06:25.181
or you don't.

01:06:25.182 --> 01:06:27.515
[Sighs] I was married to Darren

01:06:27.516 --> 01:06:28.650
for 14 years.

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:30.051
I have to give him
another chance.

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:33.355
Yeah, you don't want him to
miss out on another chance

01:06:33.356 --> 01:06:34.990
of not going down on you again.

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:37.258
Okay, I just texted Mark
and I made a date tonight,

01:06:37.259 --> 01:06:39.027
- 10:00 P.M., butchers & barbers.
- Oh, no! No!

01:06:39.028 --> 01:06:41.096
Then I said, "would you
lick me all over after?"

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:42.230
- No!
- No, I didn't say that.

01:06:42.231 --> 01:06:43.832
- Give it to me.
- We must enact

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:44.633
the good-guy pact.

01:06:44.634 --> 01:06:46.735
- Give it to me.
- [Doorbell ringing]

01:06:46.736 --> 01:06:49.071
[Squealing]

01:06:52.274 --> 01:06:53.976
[Exhaling]

01:06:56.379 --> 01:06:57.980
[Sighs]

01:06:58.481 --> 01:06:59.748
Oh, hi, babe.

01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:02.117
- Hey!
- Hey. Good to see you.

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:03.551
- Yeah.
- [Groans]

01:07:03.552 --> 01:07:06.255
- Glad you're feeling better.
- Thanks.

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:10.158
- Hey, I'm honey.
- And I'm candy.

01:07:10.159 --> 01:07:11.593
Oh.

01:07:11.594 --> 01:07:12.627
All kinds of lozenges.

01:07:12.628 --> 01:07:14.496
Cool. I thought it was
just gonna be us tonight.

01:07:14.497 --> 01:07:16.131
Yeah. Oh, of course. Of course.

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:18.534
Um, I can take it from here.

01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:20.668
Don't fuck with her.

01:07:20.669 --> 01:07:23.038
Okay. So it's time to go.

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:26.575
Um, I'll talk to you guys later.
Let's go.

01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:29.211
Don't forget your
date tonight at ten.

01:07:31.647 --> 01:07:32.747
You have a date?

01:07:32.748 --> 01:07:33.848
- Uh- - tonight?

01:07:33.849 --> 01:07:36.585
Yes. She has a date.

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:39.931
With who? [Chuckles]

01:07:39.955 --> 01:07:41.557
Not helping.

01:07:41.657 --> 01:07:43.225
Okay, come on.

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.128
So...

01:07:46.662 --> 01:07:48.696
I don't care, but
who are you dating?

01:07:48.697 --> 01:07:50.632
- Uh, I'm not. I'm just...
- I don't care.

01:07:50.633 --> 01:07:51.666
- I really don't care.
- Okay,

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:54.102
well, I might see Mark
later, because i... I just,

01:07:54.103 --> 01:07:55.737
you know, ran into
him the other day.

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:58.206
- You're dating my friend Mark?
- No, I'm not dating him.

01:07:58.207 --> 01:08:01.076
- I said I don't care.
- We... we hung out a little bit.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:03.111
- I don't care.
- Okay.

01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:04.713
I don't care.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:08.818
- Did you fuck Mark?
- What?

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:11.286
No. I mean, come on.

01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:13.688
- Yes, I did. Okay.
- Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

01:08:13.689 --> 01:08:15.323
Okay, I fucked Mark! It's
none of your business!

01:08:15.324 --> 01:08:16.524
You fucked my friend!
How could...

01:08:16.524 --> 01:08:18.493
You fucked my friend! Of
course that's my business!

01:08:18.493 --> 01:08:19.794
Forget it. Forget
I mentioned it.

01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:20.929
How could I forget that?
We got...

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:23.231
He's my friend. We go
on vacations together.

01:08:23.232 --> 01:08:24.265
We went biking in Tuscany!

01:08:24.265 --> 01:08:27.102
That was a horrible trip.
Just forget it, okay?

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:28.403
I can't forget that
you fucked my friend.

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:31.406
I don't care about Mark. I love you.
I love you, honey.

01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:32.841
I love you.

01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:34.310
Okay?

01:08:35.911 --> 01:08:37.745
- Where do you want to go?
- [Sighs]

01:08:37.746 --> 01:08:39.881
I don't care. Where
do you want to go?

01:08:39.881 --> 01:08:40.850
We'll go to butchers & barbers.

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.917
- No, we are not! Stop it.
- Get in. Get in.

01:08:42.917 --> 01:08:44.051
- Don't be a child.
- That's exactly

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:45.353
- where we're going.
- Do not be a child.

01:08:45.354 --> 01:08:46.587
- I'm not being a
child - yes, you are.

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:48.122
I'm being an extremely
angry adult!

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:49.657
- All right.
- That's a huge difference!

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:52.694
Get it out here, 'cause
we're not going there!

01:08:52.694 --> 01:08:54.962
- Are you gonna open my door?
- Of course I am.

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:56.096
Thank you.

01:08:56.098 --> 01:08:58.832
- Darren: Oh, Mark?
- Eva: Darren.

01:08:58.834 --> 01:09:01.804
- Darren: Mark!
- Darren. Darren.

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:05.040
I always knew you
wanted to fuck my wife.

01:09:05.608 --> 01:09:08.544
Whoa, uh, we're there. Uh...

01:09:09.778 --> 01:09:10.912
You're right.

01:09:10.912 --> 01:09:12.479
Oh, god. Um...

01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:14.149
Just... just deny it at least!

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:16.518
At least deny it
for appearances!

01:09:16.519 --> 01:09:18.486
For crying out loud!

01:09:18.487 --> 01:09:20.955
Guess what. Is this expensive?

01:09:20.956 --> 01:09:22.957
Mark! Oh, my god!

01:09:22.957 --> 01:09:24.759
How do you like me now? Huh?

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:25.859
- Stop it!
- Huh?

01:09:25.861 --> 01:09:27.997
- Really?
- Yeah! Yeah, really!

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:29.397
- Shin kicks?
- Darren: Yeah.

01:09:29.398 --> 01:09:31.633
- Stop it!
- You know I took kung fu?

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:32.468
- Okay.
- Huh?

01:09:32.469 --> 01:09:34.368
- He took, like, two karate...
- [Darren screams]

01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:36.037
Oh, my god.

01:09:36.604 --> 01:09:39.207
Oh, my god, Darren! Stop it!

01:09:39.207 --> 01:09:40.575
He drank a red bull in the car.

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:42.243
He's really sensitive
to caffeine.

01:09:42.243 --> 01:09:44.212
- Darren: Time out, time out!
- You're gonna hurt yourself.

01:09:44.212 --> 01:09:47.115
- Eva: I'm gonna pull up the car.
- Oh, wow. Big man, huh?

01:09:47.116 --> 01:09:49.551
- Settle down.
- Big man with the restaurant

01:09:49.551 --> 01:09:50.551
and the washboard face.

01:09:50.553 --> 01:09:52.687
Sensei Doug would be horrified.

01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:54.189
Guess what.

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:55.057
Ask her who she wants.

01:09:55.058 --> 01:09:56.925
- Oh, I'm not doing that.
- No, ask her who she wants.

01:09:56.926 --> 01:09:59.994
- Who do you want?
- I am not gonna answer that.

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:02.498
Darren: You have to

01:10:02.598 --> 01:10:04.200
choose. This...

01:10:04.533 --> 01:10:06.068
Or "Thor."

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:09.605
[Darren sighs]

01:10:10.973 --> 01:10:13.609
[Music playing]

01:10:18.914 --> 01:10:20.816
- Hey.
- Hey. [Chuckles]

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:24.253
You came. I'm glad
you called me back.

01:10:25.487 --> 01:10:26.854
I missed you.

01:10:26.855 --> 01:10:29.958
- You look really beautiful.
- Thank you.

01:10:29.959 --> 01:10:33.405
Have you thought
more about monogamy?

01:10:33.429 --> 01:10:37.265
Ah, you really love that word.
Can we talk about that later?

01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:39.234
I mean, this is a
really important party.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:42.570
- I want to talk about it now.
- [Sighs]

01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:44.173
That's...

01:10:44.273 --> 01:10:45.406
Oh.

01:10:45.407 --> 01:10:46.441
That's Steve Evans.

01:10:46.442 --> 01:10:49.744
That's the guy that picks all
the, uh, the Ted speakers.

01:10:49.745 --> 01:10:51.579
- [Sighs]
- I got to talk to him.

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:53.782
- Now?
- Yeah, come on.

01:10:59.955 --> 01:11:04.192
[Chuckles] Steve. Hey,
how are you, man?

01:11:04.193 --> 01:11:04.960
Daniel Peters,

01:11:04.961 --> 01:11:07.562
- from the... from the emails.
- From the emails.

01:11:07.563 --> 01:11:08.464
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:11:08.465 --> 01:11:09.964
- [Chuckles] Isn't that great?
- Yeah.

01:11:09.965 --> 01:11:13.402
We got to get together, man.
You know, we've been, uh...

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:16.504
Oh, this is candy.

01:11:16.505 --> 01:11:17.406
Hi.

01:11:17.407 --> 01:11:19.607
- Hey.
- Is this your girlfriend?

01:11:19.608 --> 01:11:20.842
- No!
- Yeah.

01:11:20.843 --> 01:11:21.644
I'm a free agent.

01:11:21.645 --> 01:11:23.811
I'm interested in making
lots of sexual connections,

01:11:23.812 --> 01:11:26.514
because I can't be
tied down by monogamy.

01:11:26.515 --> 01:11:28.751
- [Daniel chuckles]
- Really?

01:11:29.351 --> 01:11:30.996
Interesting.

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:32.287
What do you do, candy?

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:36.624
I study the
significance of ritual,

01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:38.192
and also I hate monogamy!

01:11:38.193 --> 01:11:40.962
[Chuckles] Give me some
casual sex, please!

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:42.563
[Laughing] Me, too!

01:11:42.564 --> 01:11:43.965
[Laughing] Yeah,
yeah, that's great.

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:46.878
- Yeah, that's fun.
- Steven: Oh, Daniel, you have...

01:11:46.902 --> 01:11:48.236
Fascinating friends.

01:11:48.237 --> 01:11:50.204
Well, she's... It's
more than a friend,

01:11:50.205 --> 01:11:51.040
- so...
- Am I?

01:11:51.041 --> 01:11:53.541
I would love to learn
more, uh, about this.

01:11:53.542 --> 01:11:55.476
Can I... Could I
get your number?

01:11:55.477 --> 01:11:57.578
- Sure, Steve.
- Hang on a minute.

01:11:57.579 --> 01:11:58.880
- Listen...
- It's good. I got my phone.

01:11:58.881 --> 01:12:00.415
- I can connect you.
- I got my phone. It's good.

01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:02.917
Daniel: I can probably connect
you guys on an email.

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:04.118
Just type it in yourself?

01:12:04.119 --> 01:12:05.953
And is it candy
with an I or a y?

01:12:05.954 --> 01:12:07.855
- With a y.
- Oh, why not?

01:12:07.856 --> 01:12:11.392
Oh. Why... why would it
be with an I, you know?

01:12:11.393 --> 01:12:12.627
Peter: You guys are
all handsome guys.

01:12:12.628 --> 01:12:14.062
You know what I'm talking about.
It's the fast-paced

01:12:14.063 --> 01:12:15.763
Hollywood lifestyle. You
know how many girls

01:12:15.764 --> 01:12:17.765
I've had sex with? 21.

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:18.766
And I'm only 35.

01:12:18.767 --> 01:12:19.702
And I've eaten 12 pussies,

01:12:19.703 --> 01:12:22.504
most of them on the
girls I've fucked. Hey!

01:12:22.638 --> 01:12:23.738
Honey: Hey.

01:12:23.739 --> 01:12:24.972
- [Clears throat]
- I got your text.

01:12:24.973 --> 01:12:26.908
Peter: One second, guys.
I'll be right back.

01:12:26.909 --> 01:12:29.410
Follow me. I got to
piss out of my cock.

01:12:29.411 --> 01:12:30.346
Did Linda read my script?

01:12:30.347 --> 01:12:33.147
Uh, yeah, she agreed with
a few things about it,

01:12:33.148 --> 01:12:35.317
so, uh, I got rid of her.

01:12:35.517 --> 01:12:37.018
You got rid of her?

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:38.353
Yeah. And, uh, it turns out

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:40.021
I got some new financiers
for the movie,

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:42.624
so it doesn't matter
what Linda thinks.

01:12:43.092 --> 01:12:44.625
Oh, plus...

01:12:44.626 --> 01:12:46.295
You're fired.

01:12:47.496 --> 01:12:48.464
Well, great, 'cause I quit.

01:12:48.465 --> 01:12:50.264
And I'm gonna write my
own movie about a woman

01:12:50.265 --> 01:12:53.901
having a religious orgasm. And
no one stabs her in the ass.

01:12:53.902 --> 01:12:56.037
First of all, you can't quit
after I fire you, so...

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:58.373
A person can be smart
and have big boobs.

01:12:58.374 --> 01:13:00.041
And people are gonna
watch my movie

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:02.211
and people are gonna love it!

01:13:02.878 --> 01:13:05.490
No one respects you, big boobs.

01:13:05.514 --> 01:13:06.949
Uh...

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:10.428
You know, I used
to want to be you.

01:13:10.452 --> 01:13:13.154
But all the success in the
world doesn't make you happy,

01:13:13.155 --> 01:13:14.556
does it?

01:13:16.258 --> 01:13:18.993
I have friends and you
don't have any friends,

01:13:18.994 --> 01:13:20.596
and I'm happy.

01:13:21.997 --> 01:13:24.465
Yeah, I guess, you know what,
maybe I'm not so happy

01:13:24.466 --> 01:13:26.034
in my life.

01:13:27.436 --> 01:13:29.203
Maybe if we had sex
in this bathroom,

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:30.172
I might be happy about that,

01:13:30.173 --> 01:13:32.441
so why don't you get
on your knees, baby?

01:13:33.342 --> 01:13:34.877
Fuck you.

01:13:38.614 --> 01:13:41.550
[Darren groaning]

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.355
Oh. Oh.

01:13:46.688 --> 01:13:48.123
Oh, wow.

01:13:49.892 --> 01:13:51.693
I'm sorry you didn't come.

01:13:53.462 --> 01:13:55.464
You know what I love about you?

01:13:55.931 --> 01:13:58.133
You're so comforting, you know?

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.102
Here's the thing...

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:02.103
Sex dies...

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:04.006
In every relationship.

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:06.841
So maybe we should be together.

01:14:06.842 --> 01:14:08.276
- What?
- I'm... I'm just...

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:10.812
I'm losing my passion
for chandra, you know?

01:14:10.813 --> 01:14:11.979
- Oh.
- You know, I just don't want

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.581
- anyone to get hurt.
- Oh my god,

01:14:13.582 --> 01:14:15.817
chandra broke up with you.
That's why you're here.

01:14:15.818 --> 01:14:18.686
No, she's following one
direction for a while.

01:14:18.687 --> 01:14:19.954
Oh, perfect!

01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:22.490
- That's so perfect!
- I know.

01:14:22.491 --> 01:14:24.325
I'm a cliché. But...

01:14:24.326 --> 01:14:27.395
The handsome guy runs off
with a younger, hot,

01:14:27.396 --> 01:14:30.598
sexy, fit, tight little girl,

01:14:30.599 --> 01:14:31.632
and then he gets bored,

01:14:31.633 --> 01:14:33.801
and he wants to come
running home to mommy.

01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:36.839
- Eva [sighs]
- [Mimics baby]

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:39.274
Mommy?

01:14:39.275 --> 01:14:40.708
Uh, I'm not your mommy, okay?

01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:43.411
Okay, you don't understand.
Here's the thing.

01:14:43.412 --> 01:14:45.223
I'm saving...

01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:46.949
My sexual energy...

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:48.550
For my art.

01:14:48.551 --> 01:14:49.917
Here's the thing.
Here's the thing.

01:14:49.918 --> 01:14:52.119
I think maybe sex doesn't
die for everyone.

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.856
It just has died for you
and your weird dick.

01:14:54.857 --> 01:14:56.624
- And Mark couldn't wait...
- Stop it. Stop it.

01:14:56.625 --> 01:14:58.960
To go down on me. He
fucking loved going down,

01:14:58.961 --> 01:15:00.161
- and I loved it!
- Oh, stop. Ew. Ew. Ew.

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:02.630
- Oh, no, see, that says it all.
- First of all, ew.

01:15:02.631 --> 01:15:04.465
- "Ew."
- ew. Ew.

01:15:04.466 --> 01:15:05.633
You asked him to go down on you.

01:15:05.634 --> 01:15:09.070
No, I didn't ask him! He asked me!
He begged me!

01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:09.972
- Oh, my god.
- Mm-hmm.

01:15:09.973 --> 01:15:11.706
- What an asshole.
- That's what he said.

01:15:11.707 --> 01:15:12.874
- Stop. That's not... stop it.
- He did.

01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:15.443
He said I had a beautiful butthole.
Ha-ha!

01:15:15.444 --> 01:15:16.211
[Moaning]

01:15:16.212 --> 01:15:20.082
- You want a line?
- No, thanks. I'm fine.

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:24.653
Oh! [Sighs]

01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:30.659
Are you a drug addict?

01:15:31.493 --> 01:15:33.228
Why would you ask that?

01:15:33.495 --> 01:15:35.030
No reason.

01:15:36.565 --> 01:15:39.800
No. Look, that's just
a piece of art, yeah?

01:15:39.801 --> 01:15:42.937
It's a piece of art about
a feeling, you know?

01:15:42.938 --> 01:15:46.008
Just a feeling some
people make me feel.

01:15:46.441 --> 01:15:47.808
So there's a lot of other people

01:15:47.809 --> 01:15:48.777
who think you're a drug addict?

01:15:48.778 --> 01:15:52.213
No. No, I just like to party
and have a good time is all,

01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:52.814
yeah?

01:15:52.815 --> 01:15:54.415
Who else thinks
you're a drug addict?

01:15:54.416 --> 01:15:58.486
[Groans] Look, just
my stupid family.

01:15:58.487 --> 01:15:59.187
Your family?

01:15:59.188 --> 01:16:00.888
Yeah, look, just 'cause
they give me money,

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:04.626
it makes them think they got
the right to judge me, yeah?

01:16:04.927 --> 01:16:07.128
But come on. Let's
get some food.

01:16:07.129 --> 01:16:10.198
Why does your family think
you're a drug addict?

01:16:10.799 --> 01:16:11.966
[Scoffs]

01:16:11.967 --> 01:16:13.501
I'm freedom, yeah?

01:16:13.502 --> 01:16:16.271
I'm free from family shackles.

01:16:17.439 --> 01:16:18.973
Stop doing drugs.

01:16:18.974 --> 01:16:20.642
I'll help you.

01:16:24.379 --> 01:16:25.981
I love you.

01:16:28.183 --> 01:16:31.053
Yeah, i... I love you so much.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.321
And I've been thinking, yeah?
I...

01:16:33.322 --> 01:16:35.723
I've got to get out of
this city for a while...

01:16:35.724 --> 01:16:39.360
'Cause sometimes a man, he
needs to go on walkabout.

01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:41.495
I've got these big
mountains to climb, yeah?

01:16:41.496 --> 01:16:45.033
A man, he needs to be able to
climb his mountains, yeah?

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:46.101
Do you understand?

01:16:46.102 --> 01:16:48.169
Not really. Are you talking
about real mountains, or...

01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:51.472
I'm talking about the mountains
that only a real man can climb,

01:16:51.473 --> 01:16:53.909
yeah? 'Cause that's...
that's me.

01:16:54.042 --> 01:16:55.577
I'm a man.

01:16:57.012 --> 01:16:58.512
Can I come with you?

01:16:58.513 --> 01:16:59.314
No.

01:16:59.315 --> 01:17:02.484
No, I've got wars to fight.
Do you see?

01:17:03.485 --> 01:17:05.697
Hey, maybe we'll reunite, yeah?

01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:07.288
In, like, five years.

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:08.689
Five years?

01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:10.192
Yeah.

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:12.628
Come on, look in my eyes.

01:17:13.595 --> 01:17:15.364
What am I thinking?

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:17.365
I don't know.

01:17:17.366 --> 01:17:20.268
Can two people ever
really be together?

01:17:20.602 --> 01:17:23.471
And once they're together, can
they ever really be apart?

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:25.173
These feelings...

01:17:25.474 --> 01:17:27.976
They'll always exist inside us.

01:17:29.945 --> 01:17:32.714
Maybe I'll come back
for you one day.

01:17:33.248 --> 01:17:34.950
But maybe not.

01:17:35.584 --> 01:17:37.051
And remember...

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:39.621
I left you better
than I found you.

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:47.094
Candy: "I left you better
than I found you"?

01:17:47.095 --> 01:17:49.430
Honey: And then he went
off to climb mountains.

01:17:49.431 --> 01:17:51.198
Probably mountains of cocaine.

01:17:51.199 --> 01:17:53.968
How can I have the
amazing sex again?

01:17:53.969 --> 01:17:55.569
I think he was the one.

01:17:55.570 --> 01:17:58.439
Eva: No, he's not the one.
You're the one.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:01.410
You're the only
one that matters.

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:03.277
These candles are dangerous.

01:18:03.278 --> 01:18:04.112
And they don't work!

01:18:04.113 --> 01:18:06.681
Let's do a spell for the power
to make our dreams come true.

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:09.550
We don't have power. We
have low self-esteem.

01:18:09.551 --> 01:18:10.851
Okay, don't say that.

01:18:10.852 --> 01:18:13.320
- [Yelling] Ah! The candles!
- Stop it.

01:18:13.321 --> 01:18:16.323
Only a stupid idiot would
believe in a magic candle.

01:18:16.324 --> 01:18:17.125
I believe in them.

01:18:17.126 --> 01:18:18.492
That's 'cause you live
in a fantasy world.

01:18:18.493 --> 01:18:19.660
- What is going on?
- Honey: Look,

01:18:19.661 --> 01:18:21.128
I paid a lot of money
for your candles

01:18:21.129 --> 01:18:23.564
and I'm gonna sue you
for false advertising!

01:18:23.565 --> 01:18:24.765
I bought them from
a candle emporium.

01:18:24.766 --> 01:18:26.834
- They're not magic.
- I hate the candles!

01:18:26.835 --> 01:18:28.002
- No!
- Whoa, calm down!

01:18:28.003 --> 01:18:29.537
You guys all have your periods, right?
That's...

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:31.505
The candles suck! All
right, you know,

01:18:31.506 --> 01:18:33.507
this is your friend.
You are fired.

01:18:33.508 --> 01:18:35.377
Oh! I quit!

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:36.944
She's not my friend!

01:18:36.945 --> 01:18:38.245
'Cause I'm not
friends with people

01:18:38.246 --> 01:18:40.515
that think I'm stupid. [Sobbing]

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.919
And we're not on our periods!

01:18:45.921 --> 01:18:49.223
I mean, to be fair,
I am on my period.

01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:51.727
It's towards the
end of my cycle.

01:18:52.461 --> 01:18:54.795
It's only a matter of time
for the rest of them, right?

01:18:54.796 --> 01:18:56.797
- Would you just stop?
- Okay.

01:18:56.798 --> 01:18:59.234
[Music playing]

01:19:28.396 --> 01:19:30.932
- [Sniffling]
- You okay?

01:19:31.032 --> 01:19:33.668
- Not really.
- You know what?

01:19:34.236 --> 01:19:35.971
Screw this place.

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.475
Hey.

01:19:40.909 --> 01:19:44.746
Working with you has been
the best part of my job.

01:19:46.748 --> 01:19:47.882
You know, I wanted
to be the voice

01:19:47.883 --> 01:19:51.662
of modern feminism,
but I'm a loser.

01:19:51.686 --> 01:19:52.254
And I...

01:19:52.255 --> 01:19:53.854
Don't think my friends will
ever talk to me again,

01:19:53.855 --> 01:19:54.889
'cause I took a big crap on them

01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:57.292
and then I crapped
in front of them.

01:19:58.126 --> 01:19:59.293
I took an emotional shit.

01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:03.030
Everything's gonna be okay.
I believe in you, yo.

01:20:03.031 --> 01:20:05.666
And you do have a
feminist voice.

01:20:05.667 --> 01:20:07.168
You're the full package.

01:20:07.169 --> 01:20:10.171
I think you're a
package and a half.

01:20:10.172 --> 01:20:11.972
- I'm a package and a half?
- Yeah.

01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:14.809
I'd even go so far as
saying you're two packages.

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:17.311
That's the nicest thing that
anyone's ever said to me.

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:19.848
That's the nicest
thing I've ever said.

01:20:21.516 --> 01:20:22.951
Huh.

01:20:30.458 --> 01:20:32.494
[Door knocking]

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:36.331
[Screams]

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:37.965
Honey: Hello. I'm looking for
the special unicorn lady

01:20:37.966 --> 01:20:41.135
who lives in this apartment
and is very magical.

01:20:41.136 --> 01:20:43.304
Oh. Leave me alone.

01:20:43.305 --> 01:20:45.707
I'm living in my fantasy world.

01:20:46.241 --> 01:20:48.043
I'm sorry I was a jerk.

01:20:48.176 --> 01:20:49.945
I really miss you.

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:53.982
Wow.

01:20:54.249 --> 01:20:57.051
I can't believe you did this.
Thanks.

01:20:57.052 --> 01:20:58.419
Don't thank me.
It's the candles.

01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:00.254
- They really work.
- Stop making fun of me.

01:21:00.255 --> 01:21:04.769
I'm not. My life was depressing
without your magic spells.

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:06.026
Thank you. It's true.

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:07.595
Listen, I have a great idea.

01:21:07.596 --> 01:21:11.199
[Eva speaking in
foreign language]

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:16.905
All right, the factory in
Jakarta's running behind.

01:21:17.272 --> 01:21:18.372
[Sighs]

01:21:18.373 --> 01:21:19.540
Can we sell the magical candles

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:21.075
in your store and
use the profits

01:21:21.076 --> 01:21:21.910
to pay candy's rent?

01:21:21.911 --> 01:21:25.780
I don't know. Maybe I have
too much low self-esteem.

01:21:26.014 --> 01:21:27.781
I'm sorry that I
projectile-vomited

01:21:27.782 --> 01:21:28.750
my low self-esteem onto you,

01:21:28.751 --> 01:21:31.518
and I promise to swallow
it back down next time.

01:21:31.519 --> 01:21:32.653
Ew.

01:21:32.654 --> 01:21:34.421
That is the grossest analogy.

01:21:34.422 --> 01:21:39.427
- Yes, you can sell candles here.
- Thank you.

01:21:39.961 --> 01:21:42.196
You guys look really cute.

01:21:42.197 --> 01:21:43.631
- We're witches.
- Oh!

01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:45.733
I thought you were,
like, mean cowgirls.

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:47.268
Witches. It's better.
It's better.

01:21:47.269 --> 01:21:49.404
Come see. We'll
set up over here.

01:21:50.839 --> 01:21:52.172
Candy: A lot of people
are gonna tell you

01:21:52.173 --> 01:21:53.374
you can't do things
in your life,

01:21:53.375 --> 01:21:55.276
and I'm here to tell
you that you can.

01:21:55.277 --> 01:21:56.810
Believe in yourself.

01:21:56.811 --> 01:22:00.248
And remember how amazing
you really are.

01:22:03.518 --> 01:22:05.586
Oh! We sold so many.

01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:07.554
Wow, witches are, like,
the new vampires.

01:22:07.555 --> 01:22:10.925
It's shocking how many people
are buying these things.

01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:13.827
The two children's
dresses we made came in.

01:22:13.828 --> 01:22:15.996
What do you want
to do with them?

01:22:15.997 --> 01:22:17.364
Oh. [Sighs]

01:22:17.365 --> 01:22:18.799
What's happening with Mark?

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:21.201
We broke up. I forgot
the good-guy pact

01:22:21.202 --> 01:22:24.872
and I chose Darren. And
I really regret it.

01:22:24.873 --> 01:22:26.040
You gotta give
those little girls

01:22:26.041 --> 01:22:27.474
- their dresses.
- Eva: I'm pretty sure

01:22:27.475 --> 01:22:30.245
he never wants to see me again.

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:34.081
Fine. What do you think?
Maybe not, right?

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:36.016
- [Children laughing]
- Oh, my god!

01:22:36.017 --> 01:22:38.085
That look. Jeez.

01:22:38.086 --> 01:22:39.955
All right. Okay.

01:22:46.328 --> 01:22:48.964
He didn't come, so there you go.

01:22:49.431 --> 01:22:50.298
Not home, right?

01:22:50.299 --> 01:22:52.300
- [Door opening]
- Oh, god.

01:22:53.001 --> 01:22:55.603
Uh, hi. How are you? Um...

01:22:56.538 --> 01:23:00.341
I know you probably don't
want to see me. Um...

01:23:00.342 --> 01:23:03.144
I made dresses for
your daughters.

01:23:04.546 --> 01:23:06.114
Nice. Thank you.

01:23:07.415 --> 01:23:08.682
I'm sorry.

01:23:08.683 --> 01:23:11.552
I'm so sorry I sabotaged
our relationship.

01:23:11.553 --> 01:23:14.355
And I'm sorry I
treated you so badly

01:23:14.356 --> 01:23:18.026
when you're just, like,
the greatest guy.

01:23:18.426 --> 01:23:20.661
Thanks for saying
that, but, uh...

01:23:20.662 --> 01:23:23.732
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

01:23:26.868 --> 01:23:27.469
Um...

01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:30.181
For what it's worth, I
broke up with Darren...

01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:31.706
For good.

01:23:32.407 --> 01:23:33.640
Just...

01:23:33.641 --> 01:23:36.076
I don't think I
