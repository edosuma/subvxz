00:01.102 --> 00:03.170
GILES:
 Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer--

00:03.204 --> 00:04.572
We had to hide
the key.

00:04.605 --> 00:08.509
Made it human
and sent it to you.
BUFFY: Dawn.

00:08.541 --> 00:10.510
Tell me what kind
of demon I'm fighting.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.712
TRAVERS:
Glory isn't a demon.
She's a God.

00:12.746 --> 00:14.548
Did you know your sister
took my key, Dawnie?

00:14.582 --> 00:17.684
She won't give it back.
I bet you know where
she put it, don't you?

00:17.718 --> 00:20.687
"They had to be certain
the Slayer would protect it
with her life,

00:20.721 --> 00:24.192
so they sent the key to her
in the form of a sister."

00:24.225 --> 00:27.928
You're the key. Go.
Before she finds you.
She's here.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.431
-I love you.
-The only chance
you had with me...

00:30.463 --> 00:32.232
was when I was unconscious.

00:32.265 --> 00:35.402
Let's see what you are.

00:35.435 --> 00:37.036
Or who you are.

00:37.070 --> 00:39.340
One soldier in a vast army.

00:39.372 --> 00:42.676
KNIGHTS:
The key is the link.
The link must be severed.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.845
Where is the key?

00:45.878 --> 00:47.515
I'd die a thousand deaths
before I'd tell you.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.218
(Screaming)

00:50.250 --> 00:52.286
No! No!

00:53.286 --> 00:54.155
Tara!

00:55.923 --> 00:58.392
No!

00:58.426 --> 01:01.060
Tara,
I'm so sorry.

01:01.094 --> 01:05.165
-What are you gonna need?
-They gave me a lot of stuff
to keep her calm.

01:11.239 --> 01:14.040
I told you
this wasn't over.

01:14.073 --> 01:18.146
Look at that. Look at that.
It's pure green energy.

01:19.447 --> 01:20.914
(chuckles)

01:28.322 --> 01:29.323
(laughs)

01:32.126 --> 01:34.962
(speaking Latin)

01:45.673 --> 01:48.641
(people gasping)

01:53.713 --> 01:56.115
-Buffy!
-We have to keep moving.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.018
I can't.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.234
I really hate it when
people touch my things.

02:15.568 --> 02:19.872
-Last words, Slay-runt?
-Just one: truck.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.811
(tires screeching)

02:27.314 --> 02:29.949
No! Not now, you idiot!

02:29.983 --> 02:32.151
Let go of my body!

02:33.853 --> 02:35.756
Oh, god.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.562
(theme music playing)

03:30.711 --> 03:34.046
And then, whoosh!
All of a sudden, Glory's
standing right there...

03:34.081 --> 03:36.917
in front of us,
all skanky and blond
and thinking she's all that

03:36.949 --> 03:39.186
just 'cause some bumpy heads
kiss her stinky feet.

03:39.218 --> 03:41.889
She does have nice feet.
And she's coming right at us,

03:41.921 --> 03:44.391
and Buffy's just
standing there
not even blinking,

03:44.425 --> 03:47.427
like "Bring it on,"
and-- wham!

03:47.461 --> 03:49.962
-Hell bitch in orbit.
-Go, Buff.

03:49.997 --> 03:53.266
I knew you'd best
Glory eventually. I mean,
all our years of training--

03:53.300 --> 03:54.768
A truck hit her.

03:54.801 --> 03:56.736
Oh.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.838
You threw it at her?

04:00.508 --> 04:04.312
Well, no. She more kind of
waited for it to hit Glory.

04:04.344 --> 04:07.114
But then Buffy ran really fast,
and we got away.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.984
I don't know
how we got away.

04:11.018 --> 04:13.086
That truck couldn't
have slowed her down
for more than a second.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.522
Well, how isn't important.
All that matters is that
the two of you are safe.

04:15.622 --> 04:20.127
(scoffs)
Safe?

04:20.160 --> 04:22.930
We've barely been able to manage
not getting seriously dead

04:22.963 --> 04:25.565
every time we've
crossed paths with Glory.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.167
Now that she knows
that Dawn is the key--

04:30.170 --> 04:31.305
There must be something

04:31.338 --> 04:32.605
in the Book of Tarnis
that we've missed,

04:32.639 --> 04:34.742
something that we can
use against Glory.

04:34.774 --> 04:35.808
Piano.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.911
Because that's what
we used to kill

04:37.944 --> 04:39.547
that big demon
that one time.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.350
No, wait. That--
That was a rocket launcher.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.951
An, what are you talking about?

04:44.985 --> 04:47.153
We should drop
a piano on her.

04:47.187 --> 04:49.856
Well, it always works for
that creepy cartoon rabbit

04:49.889 --> 04:52.024
when he's running
from that nice man
with the speech impediment.

04:52.058 --> 04:53.427
Yes, or perhaps we could

04:53.461 --> 04:55.762
paint a convincing tunnel
on the side of a mountain.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.965
Let's just keep thinking,
everyone.

04:57.997 --> 05:01.134
Perhaps we should reassemble
at the magic shop--
We can't fight her.

05:01.168 --> 05:03.637
Well, not yet, no.

05:03.670 --> 05:06.673
No. Not ever.
She's too strong, Giles.

05:06.706 --> 05:09.442
We're not gonna win this
with stakes or spells

05:09.476 --> 05:12.612
or pulling out some
uranium power core.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.648
She's a God,
and she's coming for us,

05:14.682 --> 05:16.516
so let's just not be here
when she starts knocking.

05:16.550 --> 05:17.817
Run away?

05:18.918 --> 05:21.288
Finally, a sensible plan.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.023
That's not
what she meant.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.860
-Is it?
-We can't stay here.

05:27.894 --> 05:29.228
She'll just kill us off

05:29.262 --> 05:30.564
one by one until there's
no one left standing...

05:30.598 --> 05:33.000
between her and Dawn.

05:33.033 --> 05:36.803
Buffy, we all understand
the severity of the situation,
but there must be another--

05:36.836 --> 05:39.540
No! We stay, we die.

05:39.572 --> 05:41.341
Show of hands for that option.

05:46.112 --> 05:50.718
All right. Nobody goes home.
Nobody tells anybody
we're leaving.

05:50.750 --> 05:53.821
Just pack up
whatever supplies we need,
and that's it-- we're gone.

05:53.853 --> 05:57.591
Cool. Don't have to study
for that geometry test.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.860
What about wheels?

05:59.893 --> 06:03.329
I don't think
everybody's gonna fit
in the Xandermobile.

06:03.362 --> 06:04.598
BUFFY:
Just get your stuff together.

06:04.632 --> 06:07.199
I'll handle the rest.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.939
This is--
This is terrible.

06:12.973 --> 06:16.576
I'll never be able
to mend this.
Not really my color anyway.

06:16.610 --> 06:19.045
Oh, yes.
Inappropriate humor.
(chuckles)

06:19.079 --> 06:23.850
Most amusing. Don't suppose
you know what led to this
sartorial tragedy.

06:23.884 --> 06:27.620
That's not how it works.
You know that.
Yes, of course.

06:27.654 --> 06:30.858
I just thought, maybe
after Her Magnificent
Incandescence

06:30.891 --> 06:35.862
was returned to this manly
and... painfully handsome
assemblage,

06:35.896 --> 06:39.098
you might have noticed
something interesting--

06:39.132 --> 06:42.134
a key in human form,
perhaps,

06:42.168 --> 06:44.471
lounging about
unattended.

06:44.504 --> 06:47.807
If I did, do you really think
I would tell you?

06:47.841 --> 06:50.577
Why do you insist
on fighting
the inevitable?

06:50.610 --> 06:54.281
No one can stand against
Her Blindingly Scrumptious
Luminescence.

06:54.314 --> 06:57.149
Glory. Her name is Glory.

06:57.183 --> 07:00.387
And she's your God,
you little scab, not mine.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.956
With all due respect
and fear of sharp objects,

07:03.990 --> 07:08.394
you exist, sir,
only because of
her divine greatness.

07:08.427 --> 07:11.632
You mean her divine failure,
don't you?

07:17.336 --> 07:21.341
I didn't ask for any of this.
I just want to be normal.

07:21.374 --> 07:24.110
We play the hand
we're dealt.

07:24.144 --> 07:28.447
Nothing's mine, is it?
I mean, this life, this body--
it's all infected.

07:28.481 --> 07:31.985
The only thing
I've ever cared about,
she's taken away from me.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.954
You know why I wanted
to become a doctor?

07:33.987 --> 07:36.524
Flattering
drawstring pants?

07:36.557 --> 07:40.694
To be close to people,
to witness their lives
and their deaths,

07:40.728 --> 07:42.963
to be there
alongside them,

07:42.995 --> 07:45.165
a part of everyday humanity.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.601
Maybe it's the drugs.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.137
Drugs, sir?

07:50.170 --> 07:52.840
Find the right combination,
keep her buried
where she belongs.

07:52.872 --> 07:54.975
Impossible!

07:55.007 --> 07:57.110
Her Magnificence
can never be
fully contained.

07:57.144 --> 08:00.814
She is a perfect,
all-encompassing light,

08:00.848 --> 08:02.882
one you should feel
honored to be bathed in.

08:02.915 --> 08:04.785
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled,

08:04.817 --> 08:08.021
especially with the part
where she gets her key back,
and I cease to exist.

08:08.055 --> 08:12.625
True. This oh-so-appealing
form will of necessity
be shrugged off.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.494
Not if I get
the key first.

08:14.528 --> 08:15.728
And if you did,

08:15.762 --> 08:18.699
what then?
Could you do it?

08:21.033 --> 08:24.704
Take a human life
with your own hands?

08:24.737 --> 08:29.375
Oblivion is such
a small inconvenience
in the service of a deity.

08:29.408 --> 08:31.511
Accept your fate.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.881
I mean,
you said it yourself.

08:34.914 --> 08:37.350
This life was never
really yours anyway,
was it?

08:37.384 --> 08:39.753
It doesn't matter
how I came by it.

08:39.787 --> 08:42.956
It's mine,
and I plan on keeping it.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.661
Anybody else feel that?

08:47.695 --> 08:49.495
What?

08:49.528 --> 08:51.264
Cold draft of paralyzing fear.

08:51.298 --> 08:52.865
We just need to stay calm.

08:52.899 --> 08:55.368
Calm. Right.

08:55.402 --> 08:57.537
XANDER:
Hey, we gotta be like
Sergeant Rock--

08:57.571 --> 08:59.840
cool and collected
in the face of
overwhelming odds.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.508
ANYA:
Overwhelming?

09:01.541 --> 09:04.344
How much more than "whelming"
would that be exactly?

09:04.376 --> 09:07.114
Look, everything will be
all right. We just need
to stay here calmly.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.216
-As soon as Buffy arrives--
-(tires screech)

09:12.152 --> 09:14.321
We'll feel oddly worse.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.769
What's he doing here?

09:29.802 --> 09:32.940
Just out for a jaunt.
Thought I'd swing by
and say howdy.

09:32.972 --> 09:34.741
Out.

09:34.774 --> 09:36.543
He's here because
we need him.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.779
-The hell we do.
-If Glory finds us, he's
the only one besides me

09:39.812 --> 09:42.215
-that has any chance
of protecting Dawn.
-Buffy, come on.

09:42.249 --> 09:46.186
Look, this isn't a discussion!
He stays. Get over it.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.890
(engine idling)

09:50.923 --> 09:55.095
Buckle up, kids.
Daddy's puttin'
the hammer down.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.163
(engine revving)

10:00.634 --> 10:01.934
Sign here.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.636
(indistinct P.A. announcements)

10:10.009 --> 10:11.778
Okay.
That should do it.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.750
See? Did I not tell you
how easy it would be
for us to--

10:16.783 --> 10:18.686
Hey!

10:21.788 --> 10:23.155
My pen.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.907
The trees are singing water.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.614
-You have him.
-Yes, General.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.049
Our brother has
returned to the fold.

10:50.082 --> 10:53.552
Welcome home, Orlando.

10:53.586 --> 10:59.359
I swear by my sword
your sacrifice
will not go unavenged.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.894
Shiny.

11:01.894 --> 11:04.163
Yes. I suppose it is.

11:04.197 --> 11:07.000
Pretty little girl,
she's shiny too.

11:07.033 --> 11:09.168
Watch him.
Make sure he's comfortable.

11:09.201 --> 11:12.371
So shiny.

11:12.404 --> 11:14.875
Pretty little shiny key.

11:14.908 --> 11:17.677
The key. You've seen it?

11:20.212 --> 11:23.250
Pretty little shiny girl.

11:23.283 --> 11:26.854
The monks,
they've made it human.

11:26.886 --> 11:28.721
We know the Slayer's
protecting the key.

11:28.755 --> 11:30.758
If what Orlando says is true--

11:32.192 --> 11:34.094
-Prepare to advance.
-Yes, sir.

11:34.126 --> 11:36.062
We end this now.

12:03.956 --> 12:06.458
Shouldn't somebody be asking,
"Are we there yet?"

12:08.427 --> 12:11.563
Isn't that what small,
irritating children do?

12:13.166 --> 12:16.135
That kinda only works
if you know where
you're going.

12:16.168 --> 12:20.807
(groans)
Do we know where
we're going yet?

12:20.841 --> 12:23.743
We'd already be somewhere
if Captain Slowpoke
would give up the wheel.

12:23.777 --> 12:26.546
Hey, Gramps, bloody step on it.

12:26.578 --> 12:30.250
Step on what?
I've driven tricycles
with more power.

12:30.283 --> 12:33.620
-(R.V. rattling)
-Ohh.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.121
Is anybody else queasy?

12:36.823 --> 12:39.725
He doesn't travel well.
He's like fine shrimp.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.461
I should've nicked
that Porsche I had my eye on.

12:42.495 --> 12:45.298
There's just enough room
for me, you and big sis.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.235
What?

12:48.268 --> 12:50.070
Would you give it a rest or--

12:50.102 --> 12:52.972
Or what, you're gonna
toss your cookies on my shoes?

12:53.005 --> 12:55.274
Or you can be
undead man walking.

12:55.307 --> 12:58.311
See how fast you can
hitch a ride with
a flaming thumb.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.312
Fine. Shrimp.

13:00.346 --> 13:02.349
(gagging)

13:05.518 --> 13:07.921
That guy is bloodsuckin'
the last nerve
right out of me.

13:07.955 --> 13:11.892
Well, Buffy has a point.
In a confrontation,
Spike may prove...

13:14.061 --> 13:15.995
useful.

13:16.028 --> 13:19.265
I don't know if Buffy's
thinking too clear
on that one...

13:19.298 --> 13:21.201
or anything else
right now.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.269
I've never seen her so--

13:23.302 --> 13:27.875
She's been through more than
her fair share of late.

13:27.908 --> 13:31.677
She just needs a chance
to catch her breath, regroup.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.212
GILES: She'll be all right.

13:33.245 --> 13:34.981
Yeah. She'll--

13:36.515 --> 13:38.551
XANDER: Yeah.

13:44.756 --> 13:46.994
Any luck?

13:47.027 --> 13:51.063
If you define luck
as the absence
of success, plenty.

13:51.097 --> 13:53.200
There's a couple
barrier spells,

13:53.232 --> 13:56.802
but they only work
on a fixed locus.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.871
I haven't found anything
that will work while
we're still moving.

13:58.971 --> 14:02.975
So pretty.
Can I have one?

14:03.009 --> 14:04.510
Oh, come on.

14:04.543 --> 14:06.513
Um, anyone hungry?

14:06.546 --> 14:08.148
ANYA:
Ooh! Snacks!

14:08.181 --> 14:11.250
The secret to any
successful migration.

14:14.221 --> 14:17.090
Who's up for some tasty
fried meat products?

14:18.557 --> 14:21.161
-Hey! Ow!
-Tara, no!

14:21.193 --> 14:23.196
-(Tara crying)
-WILLOW: What did I tell you?

14:23.230 --> 14:27.667
Shh. I'm sorry.
She didn't mean to.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.936
(Tara continues crying)

14:28.969 --> 14:32.338
- She doesn't know
what she's doing.
- We know.

14:32.371 --> 14:36.275
No biggie. Look, the skin's
already stopped smoking.

14:36.308 --> 14:40.379
You go ahead and play peekaboo
with Mr. Sunshine all you like.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.950
It keeps the ride
from getting boring.

14:42.982 --> 14:45.784
All the light's gone.

14:45.817 --> 14:50.222
No. Shh, baby.
The light's still outside, okay?

14:50.256 --> 14:53.961
All dark. All dark.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.628
-Dark.
-PATIENTS: Dark.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.529
-All dark.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.698
-Soon.
-Dark.

14:59.731 --> 15:02.434
-PATIENTS:
Soon. Soon.
-Dark. Dark.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.636
Soon. Soon.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.005
(Patients continue murmuring)
Soon. Dark.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.110
It's coming. The signs
are in alignment.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.711
Soon victory
will be in our grasp.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.381
All we need do
is seize the moment

15:15.414 --> 15:17.783
and squeeze
until it bleeds.

15:28.327 --> 15:30.998
DAWN:
Hey.

15:31.030 --> 15:32.966
I think Anya's
gonna try to cook.

15:35.201 --> 15:37.669
Wanna come watch the tears
and recriminations?

15:40.006 --> 15:41.874
Maybe later.

15:50.182 --> 15:52.052
Thanks.

15:53.885 --> 15:55.989
For what?

15:56.023 --> 15:59.859
You know.
Pretty much everything.

16:01.494 --> 16:04.464
Yeah. I'm doing a great job.

16:04.496 --> 16:05.697
You are.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.971
I'm the Slayer,
the Chosen One.

16:12.004 --> 16:14.474
All mythic and defendery.

16:14.506 --> 16:17.610
Evil nasties are supposed
to flee from me,

16:17.644 --> 16:19.546
not the other way around.

16:19.578 --> 16:21.713
You're not fleeing.

16:21.748 --> 16:24.616
You're...
moving at a brisk pace.

16:24.650 --> 16:28.888
Quaintly referred to
in some cultures as
the big scaredy runaway.

16:32.359 --> 16:36.062
It's the most amazing thing
anyone's ever done for me.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.601
It just keeps coming.

16:44.504 --> 16:48.341
Glory, Riley,

16:48.375 --> 16:51.943
Tara, Mom.

16:56.548 --> 16:59.152
I know,

16:59.186 --> 17:01.553
but there's a bright side.

17:01.587 --> 17:03.889
There is?

17:03.923 --> 17:07.492
At least things can't
get any crazier, right?

17:07.527 --> 17:09.560
-(arrow impacts)
-(gasps)

17:10.863 --> 17:12.798
You know this is your fault
for saying that.

17:15.434 --> 17:16.669
MAN:
Come out now!

17:16.702 --> 17:18.971
Bring up the ranks!
Advance!

17:20.707 --> 17:21.772
(man shouts)

17:21.807 --> 17:23.675
(sighs)

17:23.710 --> 17:24.611
(horses neigh)

17:31.284 --> 17:33.252
-Giles!
-I see them.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.586
SPIKE:
See who?

17:37.257 --> 17:38.290
(arrow whooshes)

17:38.325 --> 17:39.692
-XANDER: Arrows!
-SPIKE: Bloody hell!

17:39.726 --> 17:41.627
-They're throwing arrows.
-(arrow impacts)

17:44.797 --> 17:46.633
Dawn, get down under the table.

17:47.933 --> 17:50.302
-Horsies!
-(neighs)

17:50.336 --> 17:52.971
-Tara!
-(arrows impacting)

17:53.005 --> 17:56.276
-Weapons?
-Hello! You're driving one.

17:56.308 --> 17:57.977
Don't hit the horsies.

17:58.009 --> 17:59.479
We won't.

17:59.511 --> 18:01.012
Aim for the horsies.

18:18.096 --> 18:19.632
Did we shake 'em?

18:27.006 --> 18:30.176
Stay low! Watch out for--

18:31.109 --> 18:32.010
Oh!

18:34.846 --> 18:37.616
Now might be a good time
for something heroic.

18:40.686 --> 18:42.121
Xander, hatch!

18:44.523 --> 18:46.459
(grunts) Up!

19:35.875 --> 19:39.546
-Keep the pressure on.
-Always do, sweet bit.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.585
(screaming)

19:45.617 --> 19:47.220
(shouting)

19:55.261 --> 19:58.130
Not a piano, but hey.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.818
(exhales)

20:55.153 --> 20:56.588
Everyone all right?

21:03.128 --> 21:05.298
(grunts)

21:26.885 --> 21:29.255
XANDER:
We gotta find shelter.
SPIKE: Yeah. Right bloody quick.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.790
I'm burnin' up out here.

21:31.824 --> 21:35.894
(Giles groaning)

21:40.666 --> 21:44.604
BUFFY:
Careful. Spike?

21:44.636 --> 21:47.138
-Careful.
-Up.

21:47.173 --> 21:50.542
-Okay. Wil?
-I'm on it. Oh, careful!

21:58.718 --> 22:03.021
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Yeah, but Spike's hurt.

22:05.156 --> 22:07.359
-Ow! Easy with the delicates.
-They'll heal.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.563
Florence Bloody Nightingale
to the rescue.

22:12.531 --> 22:15.300
ANYA:
Um, you have
another plan, right?

22:15.334 --> 22:17.869
One that doesn't involve
pointy knives and a Winnebago?

22:17.903 --> 22:20.972
Well, we'll rest here
for a minute, but then
we have to keep moving.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.476
-Where?
-I don't know!

22:23.509 --> 22:27.012
Uh, we just-- we--
we can't-- We can't stay here.
It's too close to the wreck.

22:27.046 --> 22:28.580
-We're too easy to find.
-Buffy!

22:28.615 --> 22:29.915
Wil, how is he?

22:31.049 --> 22:32.084
BUFFY:
Wil?

22:32.117 --> 22:34.921
I think I've slowed
the bleeding, but--

22:36.122 --> 22:38.857
Okay. Okay, just--
just give me a minute.

22:40.792 --> 22:42.561
-Dawn, down!
-Oh!

22:47.266 --> 22:48.366
(whimpering)

22:51.804 --> 22:53.105
XANDER:
We got company.

22:54.272 --> 22:56.142
And they brought
a crusade.

22:58.076 --> 23:03.115
-(glass shattering)
-Yeah!

23:03.148 --> 23:05.817
-Willow!
-I'm working on it!

23:14.894 --> 23:16.429
Right!

23:16.462 --> 23:18.865
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!
Let's move it! Move it! Move it!

23:18.897 --> 23:20.132
(screams)

23:22.501 --> 23:23.836
Buffy!

23:45.423 --> 23:46.593
(indistinct shouting)

23:51.029 --> 23:52.664
The key.

24:02.642 --> 24:07.046
Enemies high and tall.
Circling arms, raise a wall.

24:10.182 --> 24:12.151
(angry chattering)

24:14.520 --> 24:16.522
(grunts)

24:16.556 --> 24:19.125
They have the general. Clerics!

24:26.164 --> 24:28.634
(chanting)

24:28.667 --> 24:32.971
Energy barrier.
A most powerful one.

24:33.005 --> 24:37.809
-Can it be breached?
-A witch's magic pales
to the might of our God.

24:37.844 --> 24:41.146
The infidels' wall
shall tumble before us.

24:42.548 --> 24:45.416
Wil, how long
will it hold?

24:46.586 --> 24:48.319
Half a day maybe.

24:52.592 --> 24:55.193
(chanting)

24:55.227 --> 24:58.396
Or until Heckle and Jeckle
punch a hole through it.

25:04.369 --> 25:09.275
So, what's the story
with these role-playing rejects?

25:10.710 --> 25:12.545
BUFFY:
Let's find out.

25:19.417 --> 25:22.421
You sure Scarface here
can hab the English?

25:22.453 --> 25:24.222
He understands me.

25:25.290 --> 25:26.424
Don't you?

25:27.727 --> 25:30.496
You were warned
we would return, Slayer.

25:30.528 --> 25:32.431
Took you long enough.

25:33.766 --> 25:36.535
What are you supposed to be,
some kind of chief?

25:37.869 --> 25:39.038
General.

25:40.038 --> 25:41.106
General.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.275
In charge of what,
getting captured?

25:44.977 --> 25:47.413
You do not
frighten me, child.

25:48.980 --> 25:51.416
The instrument of chaos
must be destroyed.

25:53.952 --> 25:59.592
Look at her that way again,
and she will be the last thing
you ever see.

25:59.625 --> 26:03.261
As I've been told,
you protect the key
of The Beast.

26:07.232 --> 26:09.736
-It's not that simple.
-Yes.

26:11.502 --> 26:15.273
The key has been
transformed,
given breath, life.

26:17.743 --> 26:20.311
Yet, this makes
no difference.

26:20.346 --> 26:23.249
The key is the link.
The link must be severed.

26:23.281 --> 26:25.217
Such is the will of God.

26:25.250 --> 26:29.320
She doesn't remember anything
about being this key
you're all looking for.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.824
The only thing
that she remembers

26:31.857 --> 26:35.662
is growing up with a mother
and a sister that love her.

26:35.694 --> 26:37.763
What kind of God
would demand her life

26:37.797 --> 26:40.199
for something that she
has no control over?

26:43.335 --> 26:45.537
We are not your enemy.

26:46.772 --> 26:49.040
Tell your men to stand down.

26:51.677 --> 26:58.317
No.
It is not her fault!
She's human now!

26:58.349 --> 27:02.954
The key is too dangerous
to be allowed to exist,

27:02.989 --> 27:06.692
no matter what form it
has been pressed into.

27:06.726 --> 27:09.194
-I will not let anyone tell me--
-(Tara cries)

27:09.228 --> 27:11.529
WILLOW:
Shh! Shh!

27:11.563 --> 27:14.200
-Shh. Shh. (shushing)
-What happened?

27:14.232 --> 27:15.801
I don't know.
She just went nuts.

27:15.835 --> 27:18.136
-(whimpering)
-Shh. Shh.

27:18.170 --> 27:21.339
Time! T-T-Time!

27:21.373 --> 27:23.275
WILLOW:
Tara. Tara.

27:23.308 --> 27:26.813
(grunting)

27:26.846 --> 27:28.847
Tara!

27:28.881 --> 27:31.150
We have to do something.

27:31.182 --> 27:35.487
She can't just stay this way.
Buffy.

27:35.520 --> 27:38.990
-Time, time, time.
-Shh.

27:39.025 --> 27:41.961
PATIENTS:
Time, time, time.

27:41.993 --> 27:45.497
Time, time, time.

27:45.530 --> 27:49.134
No, it's not time
for your meds.
Just lie back and--

27:49.167 --> 27:51.971
Time! Time! Time!

27:52.003 --> 27:54.707
Doctor!
Dr. McCarthy!

27:57.108 --> 28:00.011
Time. Time. Time.

28:00.046 --> 28:04.182
Time. Time. Time.

28:04.215 --> 28:08.755
Time. Time. Time. Time.

28:08.788 --> 28:11.923
-It's time. It's time.
-No, no. Shh.

28:11.958 --> 28:14.326
There's nothing to fear,
my brother.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.929
The Beast may have
taken your mind,

28:16.962 --> 28:19.030
but I swear to you,

28:19.065 --> 28:21.267
she will never know
the taste of your heart.

28:21.299 --> 28:23.201
(stabs)

28:29.240 --> 28:31.343
Clerics!

28:31.376 --> 28:36.015
I want the witch's
barrier down. Now!

28:36.048 --> 28:38.616
(chanting)

28:40.451 --> 28:41.686
I'm sorry.

28:41.720 --> 28:42.855
What for?

28:42.888 --> 28:45.590
We should've stayed.

28:45.624 --> 28:48.894
If we had, none of this
would've happened.
Don't.

28:51.998 --> 28:54.066
What you did...

28:54.099 --> 28:56.468
w-was necessary,

28:58.436 --> 29:00.372
what I've always admired.

29:00.405 --> 29:02.740
Uh, running away?

29:02.775 --> 29:06.846
Being able to place your heart
above all else.

29:11.951 --> 29:16.355
I'm so proud of you.
You've come so far.

29:18.857 --> 29:23.561
You're everything a Watcher--

29:23.595 --> 29:25.798
everything
I could have hoped for.

29:48.453 --> 29:50.221
Willow.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.791
Open a door.

30:10.076 --> 30:13.679
Speak.
One of my friends was hurt
when you attacked us.

30:13.711 --> 30:17.682
And 10 of my men are dead.
Honorable men.

30:17.715 --> 30:19.785
Shall we balance
the scale?

30:19.817 --> 30:23.221
Will you let someone come
and help him or not?

30:23.255 --> 30:26.125
Give quarter
to an agent
of The Beast?

30:26.157 --> 30:29.560
What madness
would move me
to such action?

30:29.595 --> 30:33.164
-I'm done asking.
-Whoa! Whoa, hey. Uh...

30:33.199 --> 30:36.667
This is war, isn't it?

30:36.701 --> 30:38.703
And if there's one thing
I've learned from
Sergeant Rock is...

30:38.737 --> 30:41.207
in war, there are rules.

30:41.240 --> 30:44.076
Or at least
there should be,

30:44.109 --> 30:46.913
if you're as honorable
as you think you are.

30:46.945 --> 30:49.847
Plus we do have your
General Forehead guy.

30:54.685 --> 30:57.123
Discharge and bring life.

31:02.060 --> 31:04.863
Handier than a Swiss knife.

31:04.896 --> 31:08.634
Look, the door to my crypt's
got this nasty squeak.
Maybe you could--

31:09.800 --> 31:13.204
Hey, uh, it's Buffy.

31:13.239 --> 31:16.075
I need to ask you
a really big favor.

31:36.561 --> 31:39.865
You, uh, forgot to mention
the costume party outside.

31:39.897 --> 31:43.701
Sorry. I didn't know
who else to call.

31:43.734 --> 31:45.304
No, it's okay.

31:45.336 --> 31:48.140
I mean, yeah,
not how I pictured
seeing you again,

31:48.173 --> 31:50.442
but, uh, I'll take
what I can get.

31:54.512 --> 31:57.282
Thank you... for coming.

31:57.316 --> 31:59.750
My pleasure.

32:11.529 --> 32:13.565
(panting)

32:13.598 --> 32:16.468
All right.
I think I got him stabilized,
but there's a lot of damage.

32:16.501 --> 32:18.836
We need to get him
out of here.

32:18.869 --> 32:21.973
Well, I think the guys
with the pointy swords
kinda have other ideas.

32:22.008 --> 32:24.009
Don't they always?

32:24.042 --> 32:27.846
Look, I know
this must seem extra
 Outer Limits to you.

32:27.878 --> 32:30.249
This? No, I've seen things
you wouldn't believe.

32:30.281 --> 32:35.287
You know, emergency room,
full moon on a Saturday night.

32:35.320 --> 32:39.758
Look, if this gets too weird,
just tell me. I'll understand.

32:39.790 --> 32:43.494
Don't worry about me.
I won't leave until
I've worn out my welcome.

32:47.732 --> 32:49.734
(panting)

33:01.880 --> 33:03.382
Ow.

33:10.756 --> 33:12.990
Thanks.

33:15.260 --> 33:16.994
You know those things
will kill you.

33:19.265 --> 33:21.700
Oh. Right.

33:24.369 --> 33:27.073
I mention today how much
I don't like you?

33:28.507 --> 33:31.742
You might have let it
slip in... once or twice.

33:35.280 --> 33:38.517
-How are your feelers?
-(sighs)

33:38.549 --> 33:41.052
It's nothing compared
to the little bits
we're gonna get chopped into

33:41.086 --> 33:44.190
when the Renaissance Faire
kicks the door in.

33:44.222 --> 33:46.857
And here we bloody sit.

33:46.892 --> 33:49.595
It's not like we got
much of a choice.
We could make a break for it.

33:50.596 --> 33:52.198
Use General Armor All
as a shield,

33:52.230 --> 33:54.766
-get to the doc's car, and--
-Great plan.

33:54.799 --> 33:57.935
and while all the hacking
and slashing's going on, what
are you gonna be doin', huh?

33:57.969 --> 34:01.207
Throwin' migraines at 'em?
Look, we stay here,
we all die.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.875
At least this way,
some of us might get--
BUFFY: No.

34:03.909 --> 34:06.577
We're all gonna make it.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.579
I'm not losing anyone.

34:11.117 --> 34:15.221
Check the supplies.
See if anyone's hungry.

34:21.559 --> 34:23.695
(General laughs)

34:23.728 --> 34:25.864
Dissension in the ranks.

34:25.896 --> 34:28.599
Seldom a harbinger
of glad tidings.

34:32.902 --> 34:33.938
Shut up.

34:37.342 --> 34:39.878
Poor, frightened girl.

34:39.911 --> 34:43.215
You've no idea
what you've gotten
yourself into.

34:43.248 --> 34:46.585
Why don't you tell me?
Would it make
a difference?

34:48.853 --> 34:51.456
What do you know
of The Beast?

34:51.489 --> 34:54.925
Strong, fast, hell-god.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.762
From a dimension
of unspeakable torment.

34:57.795 --> 35:00.931
A demon dimension.
I know.

35:00.965 --> 35:03.568
She ruled with
two other hell-gods, right?

35:03.601 --> 35:06.838
Along with The Beast,
they were a triumvirate
of suffering and despair,

35:06.871 --> 35:09.074
ruling
with equal vengeance.

35:09.106 --> 35:13.445
But The Beast's power
grew beyond even what
they could conceive,

35:13.478 --> 35:16.414
as did her lust
for pain and misery.

35:16.447 --> 35:20.818
They looked upon her,
what she had become,
and trembled.

35:22.521 --> 35:25.291
-A God afraid?
-Such was her power.

35:25.324 --> 35:30.094
They feared she would
attempt to seize their
dimension for herself...

35:30.128 --> 35:32.130
and decided
to strike first.

35:32.164 --> 35:35.132
A great battle erupted.

35:35.166 --> 35:38.936
In the end,
they stood victorious
over The Beast.

35:38.969 --> 35:41.206
Barely.
She was cast out,

35:41.239 --> 35:45.777
banished
to this lower plane
of existence,

35:45.811 --> 35:47.778
forced to live
and eventually die...

35:47.813 --> 35:51.282
trapped within
the body of a mortal,

35:51.317 --> 35:54.353
a newborn male
created as her prison.

35:54.385 --> 35:57.456
That is The Beast's
only weakness.

35:57.489 --> 36:01.527
Kill the man,
and the God dies.

36:01.559 --> 36:06.063
Unfortunately, the identity
of the human vessel has
never been discovered.

36:06.097 --> 36:10.369
I don't understand.
Now, I've seen Glory.

36:10.402 --> 36:12.838
Not a whole lot going on
in the hairy chest department.

36:12.871 --> 36:15.072
You have seen a glimpse
of the true beast.

36:15.106 --> 36:17.876
Her power was too great
to be completely contained.

36:17.909 --> 36:21.746
She's found a way to escape
her mortal prison
for brief periods

36:21.780 --> 36:24.148
before her energies
are exhausted

36:24.181 --> 36:28.487
and she's forced back
into her living cell
of meat and bone.

36:28.519 --> 36:31.922
What about me?
What about the key?

36:31.956 --> 36:34.925
-Dawn.
-I want to know.

36:34.960 --> 36:39.231
The key is almost as old
as The Beast itself.

36:39.264 --> 36:42.768
Where it came from,
how it was created,

36:42.800 --> 36:45.271
the deepest
of mysteries.

36:45.304 --> 36:49.275
All that is certain
is that its power
is absolute.

36:49.307 --> 36:51.342
Countless generations
of my people

36:51.376 --> 36:54.280
have sacrificed
their lives
in search of it

36:54.313 --> 36:57.114
to destroy it
before its wrath
could be unleashed.

36:57.148 --> 36:59.518
But the monks
found it first.

36:59.550 --> 37:02.920
Yes, and hid it
with their magics.

37:02.954 --> 37:05.757
Why didn't they just
destroy it? If the key
is as dangerous as--

37:05.791 --> 37:08.059
Because they were fools.

37:08.092 --> 37:10.862
They thought they could
harness its power for
the forces of light.

37:10.896 --> 37:13.699
They failed and paid
with their blood.

37:13.731 --> 37:18.737
What do I do?
What was I created for?

37:18.769 --> 37:23.342
You were created
to open the gates
that separate dimensions.

37:24.675 --> 37:27.579
The Beast
will use your power
to return home

37:27.612 --> 37:30.916
and seize control
of the hell
she was banished from.

37:30.949 --> 37:34.719
(laughs)
That's it?

37:34.753 --> 37:39.257
That's Glory's master plan?
To go home?

37:39.291 --> 37:43.961
You misunderstand.
Once the key is activated,

37:43.994 --> 37:46.231
it won't just open the gates
to The Beast's dimension.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.233
It's going to open
all the gates.

37:48.266 --> 37:52.003
The walls
separating realities
will crumble.

37:52.036 --> 37:54.440
Dimensions will
bleed into each other.

37:54.472 --> 37:58.677
Order will be overthrown,
and the universe will
tumble into chaos.

37:58.710 --> 38:01.847
All dark... forever.

38:04.382 --> 38:07.385
That is what you
were created for.

38:14.326 --> 38:16.126
Dawn.

38:17.862 --> 38:22.833
You think it's true...
what he said?

38:25.135 --> 38:27.005
(sighs)

38:32.177 --> 38:34.144
I don't know.

38:36.514 --> 38:38.182
Destroyer of the universe.

38:40.985 --> 38:44.289
I guess cutting school
doesn't seem so bad now, huh?

38:44.322 --> 38:47.992
It's not you.
You know that.

38:49.860 --> 38:52.197
But it's in me, isn't it?

38:53.498 --> 38:55.099
It's inside me.

39:01.072 --> 39:03.108
What are we gonna do?

39:06.911 --> 39:10.615
I won't let anything
happen to you.

39:12.451 --> 39:14.351
I promise.

39:17.456 --> 39:19.557
(sighs)

39:19.590 --> 39:22.661
Wriggling.

39:22.693 --> 39:26.231
Come on, Tara.
You have to eat something.
(whimpers)

39:26.264 --> 39:28.833
Want me to try?

39:28.867 --> 39:31.802
Don't know. I'm gettin'
used to pickin' fruit
outta my hair.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.407
You.

39:37.809 --> 39:41.112
You are not a part
of this, are you?

39:41.146 --> 39:45.250
-Just a friend of the family.
-Would you die for them?

39:47.284 --> 39:49.420
Because that is
what your future holds

39:49.454 --> 39:52.923
if you align yourself
with the Slayer and
her misguided people.

39:54.893 --> 39:57.728
It's my life, and I'll do
what I please with it.

39:57.762 --> 40:00.030
It's not just your life.

40:00.065 --> 40:04.168
Unimaginable legions
will perish,
including everyone here.

40:06.137 --> 40:08.072
You can stop this.

40:08.106 --> 40:12.443
You can save
all their lives
by ending one.

40:12.478 --> 40:17.047
The little girl. The key.

40:17.081 --> 40:20.217
Destroy it, and the will
of The Beast will be broken.

40:20.251 --> 40:25.155
She will fade,
a distant memory,

40:25.190 --> 40:27.793
and all of this madness
will end.

40:31.663 --> 40:34.264
(Giles panting)

40:36.166 --> 40:39.103
-(gasps)
-Sorry.

40:39.137 --> 40:43.440
Is-- Is he gonna be okay?

40:43.474 --> 40:45.811
He was hurt pretty bad, Dawn.

40:48.514 --> 40:49.947
It's because of me.

40:51.817 --> 40:53.684
It's all my fault.

40:53.719 --> 40:55.487
No, it isn't.

40:55.521 --> 40:58.623
You don't know
what's happening.

40:59.557 --> 41:01.527
I don't have to.

41:03.193 --> 41:08.032
I just know that sometimes
terrible things happen
to good people.

41:08.065 --> 41:10.902
It shouldn't, but it does.

41:11.969 --> 41:13.838
It's nobody's fault.

41:18.976 --> 41:21.746
That's just
the way life is.

41:25.416 --> 41:26.918
Is that gonna help?

41:29.420 --> 41:31.722
-(struggling breaths)
-Ben?

41:38.096 --> 41:40.364
-You have to let me out.
-Ben?

41:40.398 --> 41:43.034
You don't understand.
I gotta get out!
Open a door now!

41:43.068 --> 41:45.269
What happened?
I-I don't know.
He just freaked out.

41:45.369 --> 41:47.739
-Let me out!
-Okay. Wil, open a door.

41:47.773 --> 41:49.775
No! Ha!

41:57.615 --> 42:00.851
Well, what do you know?
Little Ben finally
did something right.

42:00.885 --> 42:04.556
-The Beast.
-Hey, it's Gregor.

42:10.195 --> 42:11.528
Now it's not.

42:12.864 --> 42:14.099
(yells)

42:25.242 --> 42:26.777
Buffy!

42:30.280 --> 42:32.117
MAN:
The Beast!
Prepare to attack!

42:34.485 --> 42:37.088
(swords clashing)

42:37.121 --> 42:40.490
-Dawn!
-(men screaming)

42:43.628 --> 42:47.297
Willow! Get it down now!

42:47.331 --> 42:51.737
Hear, hear my plea,
circling arms protecting me.

43:01.746 --> 43:03.447
We have to--

43:10.288 --> 43:11.989
The Beast.

43:16.827 --> 43:19.097
The car. Get the keys.

43:22.000 --> 43:26.304
Buffy. Buffy,
we have to find Dawn.
We can't let Glory--

43:27.472 --> 43:29.708
Buffy, Buffy.

43:31.141 --> 43:34.445
Buffy, you have to get up.
We need you.

43:39.550 --> 43:43.454
WILLOW:
Buffy, please! Buffy!

44:24.195 --> 44:25.731
Grr! Arrgh!
