11:21.931 --> 11:24.433
-wanted him to come over and rape her.
-What?

11:24.600 --> 11:26.894
He says he’s got correspondence
that’ll prove it.

11:27.103 --> 11:29.522
-We’re heading over to his place.
-Toss it good.

11:29.772 --> 11:30.856
Rita...

11:31.899 --> 11:34.527
will you look into this with Greg?
I got that 2:00 I need to get to.

11:34.610 --> 11:37.196
-No problem.
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)

11:37.321 --> 11:40.533
Fifteenth Squad. Oh, one moment, please.

11:41.492 --> 11:43.411
Florence George, Kelvin’s mother.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.664
Detective Sipowicz.

11:48.082 --> 11:51.377
(CLEARS THROAT) Okay, calm down.
You all right?

11:51.669 --> 11:53.963
-We’ll be right over there.
-What’s going on?

11:54.213 --> 11:56.841
Somebody just fired shots
into her apartment.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.028
-Any witnesses?
-Nothing solid.

12:18.112 --> 12:21.198
A couple people saw two white guys,
speeding off on a motorcycle.

12:21.323 --> 12:23.659
But nobody got the license plate
number or make of the bike.

12:23.784 --> 12:26.203
If I had been in the front room,
I’d be dead.

12:26.328 --> 12:28.914
-Has Kelvin contacted you yet?
-About five minutes ago.

12:29.039 --> 12:31.000
He swears he didn’t run over
no kids this morning.

12:31.208 --> 12:32.626
-Is he on his way in?
-No.

12:32.752 --> 12:33.753
Why not?

12:33.836 --> 12:36.547
(SIGHS) He’s got a warrant out
on a pot possession charge,

12:36.672 --> 12:38.090
and he knows y’all gonna put him in jail.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.009
Did you tell him
you almost got killed over this?

12:40.176 --> 12:41.927
He’s scared.
He don’t know what to do.

12:42.011 --> 12:45.139
Lady, your son is walking around out there
with a bull’s-eye on his chest.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.891
He didn’t do no hit-and-run.

12:46.974 --> 12:49.935
Fine, then he needs to get his ass
in right now and explain himself.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.812
As long as he’s on the street,
there’s nothing we can do for him.

12:52.062 --> 12:54.315
There sure as hell is, you could arrest
those Italians,

12:54.398 --> 12:56.150
that was parked
across the street this morning.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.943
For what? For parking across the street?

12:58.027 --> 12:59.904
Well, they’re probably the ones
who shot my apartment.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.864
All right, listen,
if you want your son to live,

13:01.989 --> 13:04.116
you need to get him to turn himself in.

13:04.658 --> 13:05.785
Damn!

13:10.372 --> 13:11.624
ROBERTA: You’re not married, correct?

13:11.707 --> 13:14.043
No, but I am involved
in a relationship with someone.

13:14.293 --> 13:17.129
-Are you heterosexual?
-(CHUCKLES) Yes, very much so.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.840
As a squad detective,
are those hours pretty regular?

13:19.924 --> 13:22.092
If it becomes an issue,
I can make alternate plans

13:22.176 --> 13:24.428
-to have someone look after Michael.
-Who?

13:24.720 --> 13:27.306
Well, my girlfriend,
who’s an assistant DA.

13:27.431 --> 13:30.434
Or, uh, fellow detectives,
who are parents also.

13:30.601 --> 13:33.103
I assume you have weapons
in the home.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.356
Um, just one,
and I’m usually attached to it.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.484
You have any experience
at raising children, Mr. Jones?

13:38.818 --> 13:42.446
I’ve been involved in a mentoring program
as you can see from my application.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.532
In terms of managing behavior
or discipline...

13:44.698 --> 13:46.617
No, I wasn’t given the impression
from you office

13:46.742 --> 13:48.953
that there a whole lot of people,
jumping at the chance to take Michael in.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.871
He’s not a stray dog, Mr. Jones.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.874
He’s a child
dealing with some very serious issues.

13:54.750 --> 13:57.711
I’ve known Michael Gorman
a couple of months now.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.214
I’ve been with him
through the death of his mom

14:00.297 --> 14:03.217
-and his dad getting locked up.
-Mm-hmm, I respect that.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.344
But I’ve worked hundreds of cases
like this.

14:05.469 --> 14:08.222
When someone who’s close to the child,
discovers that they’re ill-equipped

14:08.347 --> 14:11.267
to deal with bad behavior,
sometimes extreme behavior.

14:11.517 --> 14:14.019
They come back to me,
saying they can’t do it anymore,

14:14.311 --> 14:17.273
which leaves the child crushed
when they have to move out.

14:18.858 --> 14:22.444
I was raised by my grandma.
She got sick when I was 14,

14:22.653 --> 14:25.364
and I was basically on my own,
staying with friends.

14:26.323 --> 14:28.534
Now, this one buddy of mine,
his dad was a cop.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.286
I started having dinner
a lot at their home,

14:30.369 --> 14:33.956
and I... ended up moving in with them
until my grandma got better.

14:35.207 --> 14:39.253
But... my friend’s dad
was the only guy I could go to.

14:41.046 --> 14:44.008
The only guy I could confide in,
that I could trust.

14:44.174 --> 14:46.552
I’m not some do-gooder
with his head in the clouds.

14:46.635 --> 14:49.346
I’ve been there.
I know what Michael needs.

14:49.430 --> 14:52.600
And if you give me the opportunity,
I can provide that for him.

14:53.809 --> 14:55.686
We’ll schedule a visit to your home.

14:56.061 --> 14:58.647
Review your references
and the rest of your application.

14:59.940 --> 15:02.610
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

15:09.700 --> 15:10.951
Right this way.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.166
That’s, uh, Michelle Foster
from this morning.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.542
-The rape victim?
-Yeah.

15:18.792 --> 15:22.338
We checked into this, uh,
Norman Reese’s story.

15:22.922 --> 15:26.175
He’s got all kinds of documentation
showing that she invited him over.

15:26.342 --> 15:29.261
Any evidence that they spoke
on the phone beforehand, like he said?

15:29.345 --> 15:30.888
He gave us a number he called,

15:30.971 --> 15:33.140
and it was for a coffee place
in the East Village.

15:33.265 --> 15:36.393
And they said it’s not that unusual
for customers to take calls there.

15:38.145 --> 15:39.813
You run Reese with BCI?

15:39.939 --> 15:42.608
(SIGHS) No record.
Not even a parking ticket.

15:43.150 --> 15:44.526
See what she says.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.074
(DOOR CLOSING)

15:51.825 --> 15:54.745
So, Michelle, uh,
just a couple of questions for you.

15:55.579 --> 15:58.624
-Do you, uh, use the internet much?
-Sure.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.669
-You ever go into chat rooms?
-Um, sometimes.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.505
-What kind of chat rooms do you go into?
-Uh...

16:06.006 --> 16:08.634
I went into one about vacationing
in the Bahamas.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.511
RITA: Have you ever been in a chat room

16:10.636 --> 16:13.430
-called "Female for male rough play"?
-No.

16:13.555 --> 16:16.308
-Do you know a man named Norman Reese?
-No.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.936
You didn’t meet Mr. Reese
in the "rough play" room?

16:19.937 --> 16:22.731
I already told you I haven’t been
in that chat room.

16:22.898 --> 16:25.192
When you do go into rooms,
what’s the name you use?

16:25.442 --> 16:28.862
-"Michelle F."
-Have you ever used the name "Nasty girl"?

16:29.196 --> 16:31.323
What on earth are you talking about?

16:31.532 --> 16:35.035
The man who attacked you this morning,
he says that he met you in a chat room

16:35.119 --> 16:37.121
and that you invited him to come over.

16:37.830 --> 16:41.750
-That is outrageous.
-He has a lot of evidence to back it up.

16:41.959 --> 16:45.212
Including what he says, is a phone call
to you, confirming your interest.

16:45.504 --> 16:46.714
It’s a total lie.

16:46.922 --> 16:50.092
Michelle, is there any possibility
you went into a chat room...

16:50.175 --> 16:51.468
-No!
-...invited this guy over,

16:51.552 --> 16:54.680
-and it got out of hand?
-No! No! Absolutely not.

16:54.805 --> 16:57.641
I don’t know any... Norman Reese?

16:57.725 --> 17:00.352
And I have never been
in any "rough play" chat room.

17:00.477 --> 17:03.355
I answered my door for the cable company,
and I was raped!

17:03.480 --> 17:05.858
I cannot believe this is happening,

17:05.983 --> 17:08.277
and I can’t believe
you’re doing this to me!

17:08.360 --> 17:10.738
-We’ll look into it some more.
-You do that!

17:17.828 --> 17:21.874
-I tend to buy her story.
-Yeah, me too.

17:26.879 --> 17:29.214
We got more digging to do.
I’ll fill you in.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.591
All right.

17:31.842 --> 17:34.803
We got to get this Kelvin George in,
before those loony Italians kill him.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.806
We’re running guys
he’s been collared with.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.016
I’ll pitch in on that.

17:39.099 --> 17:42.144
Before you get going,
I have a quick announcement to make.

17:46.023 --> 17:48.567
Just wanna let you all know
that I’m putting in my papers

17:48.650 --> 17:50.486
for retirement. I’m leaving the job.

17:51.945 --> 17:53.030
When?

17:53.197 --> 17:55.824
I got my appointment
with the pension board in a few days,

17:55.949 --> 17:58.202
so soon after that. Uh, maybe a week.

17:58.744 --> 18:02.247
-You leaving to something?
-Security director job.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.750
-Which you accepted when?
-Andy.

18:05.125 --> 18:08.337
I interviewed for it last week.
I accepted yesterday.

18:09.797 --> 18:10.881
So...

18:11.632 --> 18:14.468
-Congratulations.
-Yeah, absolutely.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.304
CONNIE: We’ll miss you.

18:17.596 --> 18:20.682
As soon as my last day’s firmed up,
I’ll pass it on.

18:23.102 --> 18:26.855
-Well, how about that?
-Yeah. Well, we got work to do.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.670
Boss, we ran the screen name "Nasty girl,"

18:49.837 --> 18:52.756
through the internet provider.
It came back to a Courtney Bates.

18:52.923 --> 18:55.092
-Not Michelle Foster?
-Courtney Bates.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.052
That wasn’t something
we should have checked

18:57.177 --> 18:58.303
before leaning on the victim?

18:58.512 --> 19:00.597
The ISP was being a real pain
in the ass earlier,

19:00.681 --> 19:03.100
about opening their records
without a court order.

19:03.225 --> 19:06.061
-They finally relented.
-And it took some convincing.

19:06.353 --> 19:08.230
Maybe threatening’s a better word.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.816
I don’t wanna know.
Just get this Courtney Bates in.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.527
So, uh, boss?

19:14.361 --> 19:16.113
-Yeah?
-Any particular reason

19:16.238 --> 19:18.532
for the, uh, sudden departure?

19:18.740 --> 19:21.743
-I.. I... I know, the squad’s curious.
-Speak for yourself, Medavoy.

19:22.452 --> 19:24.288
It was time for me to go.

19:24.413 --> 19:27.082
GREG: Uh, the outcome of the trial,
did that factor in?

19:27.374 --> 19:29.376
Next, are you gonna ask him
to turn his head and cough?

19:29.626 --> 19:31.795
-It’s okay, Andy.
-No, it was time to go.

19:32.045 --> 19:33.088
You said it already.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.756
He don’t need to put you
under the hot light.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.758
I can’t say the trial didn’t factor in,

19:36.884 --> 19:39.845
but, uh, it’s just time for me to go.
Where you guys at?

19:40.512 --> 19:43.932
Uh, we're going to have a conversation
with Tony Grimaldi, the father of the DOA.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.935
See if he can get his boys to back off,
from hunting down Kelvin George.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.608
I was just curious.

19:52.816 --> 19:55.777
-You’re nosy.
-I’m just curious.

20:10.292 --> 20:13.503
Mr. Grimaldi,
you have our deepest sympathies.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.505
Thank you.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.174
I know this is the last thing
you wanna do,

20:17.299 --> 20:18.926
but we need to talk
to you about this morning.

20:19.176 --> 20:22.346
-Did you see what happened?
-No, I was in the kitchen.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.641
(CLEARS THROAT) We know people
in this neighborhood look up to you.

20:25.807 --> 20:28.560
Has anybody given you information
that could help us?

20:29.019 --> 20:30.479
We were out of coffee.

20:31.980 --> 20:34.274
So, I sent Theresa to get some
from the corner market.

20:34.441 --> 20:37.069
If I would have got up off
my lazy ass and done it myself,

20:37.236 --> 20:38.320
she’d still be alive.

20:39.696 --> 20:42.616
-We’re very sorry, sir.
-ANDY: Mr. Grimaldi...

20:43.575 --> 20:45.994
(CLEARS THROAT)
...there’s people out there right now.

20:46.286 --> 20:47.663
People associated with you,

20:47.871 --> 20:49.998
who are looking
for the driver of that car.

20:50.123 --> 20:52.417
They already fired shots
into his mother’s apartment.

20:52.626 --> 20:53.794
My daughter’s dead.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.255
You think I give a rat’s ass
about the son of a bitch who killed her?

20:56.338 --> 20:58.590
We know you care about the other guys
out there looking for him.

20:58.715 --> 21:01.260
We tried to let them know
if anything happens to our suspect,

21:01.385 --> 21:03.845
they’re going to jail,
but they’re not listening to us.

21:04.012 --> 21:06.390
Yeah? That’s ’cause they know
this son of a bitch

21:06.473 --> 21:09.518
-ain’t gonna do any real time.
-Oh, he absolutely will.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.812
Vehicular manslaughter,
possibly two counts,

21:11.937 --> 21:14.523
and fleeing the scene of an accident?
He’ll do time.

21:14.606 --> 21:17.818
Let us do our job and let each
of your guys stay out of jail.

21:18.777 --> 21:22.864
If this guy, don’t pay a fair price,
for taking my daughter’s life,

21:23.031 --> 21:26.159
when he hits the street again...
all bets are off.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.288
Yeah, we’ll take care of that.

21:30.330 --> 21:31.915
I’ll put out the word.

21:44.720 --> 21:48.015
-He’s right here. Don’t hang up.
-It’s Kelvin George.

21:48.181 --> 21:49.683
CONNIE: I’m putting him
on the phone, right now.

21:49.766 --> 21:52.269
No, it’s him. You have my word.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.980
Detective Sipowicz.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.942
It's fine, come in and tell me
where you were this morning.

21:59.568 --> 22:02.696
Kelvin, how can I say I believe you’re
not based on a phone conversation, huh?

22:02.863 --> 22:04.573
Don’t worry
about your damn pot possession.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.158
Worry about your mom, who got shot at.

22:06.241 --> 22:08.660
Worry about not getting killed
by that lynch mob,

22:08.744 --> 22:11.496
who’s out there looking for you,
right now, huh?

22:11.705 --> 22:13.206
Now, where can we meet you?

22:13.290 --> 22:15.667
I’m gonna get the car,
I’ll meet you in front.

22:16.877 --> 22:18.587
Yeah. Uh-huh.

22:18.670 --> 22:22.007
-Have a seat, Courtney.
-Okay. (SIGHS)

22:22.883 --> 22:26.094
-You a student?
-Yeah, but I’m taking a semester off.

22:26.303 --> 22:28.555
-(SIGHS) You know Michelle Foster?
-No.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.308
You didn’t go on the internet pretending
to be Michelle Foster?

22:31.391 --> 22:32.434
Pardon me?

22:32.684 --> 22:35.520
We got information that,
uh, you’ve been going into chat rooms

22:35.604 --> 22:39.691
under the moniker "Nasty girl"
and claiming to be Michelle Foster.

22:39.775 --> 22:42.319
Well, I, uh, don’t know that person.

22:42.402 --> 22:44.988
And I’ve never in my life
called myself "Nasty girl."

22:45.155 --> 22:48.700
(SIGHS) Michelle Foster
was raped this morning.

22:48.784 --> 22:52.120
By a guy, who thought
she was Inviting him over for rough sex.

22:52.496 --> 22:55.665
Because of what this "Nasty girl" said
in a chat room?

22:55.749 --> 22:56.958
There you go.

22:57.042 --> 23:00.712
Well, I’m sorry to hear that,
but I had nothing to do with it.

23:00.962 --> 23:03.256
Then how’s the name "Nasty girl"
get back to your account?

23:03.548 --> 23:07.386
I bought my computer, secondhand.
It was somebody else’s before that.

23:07.469 --> 23:10.305
I, um, sometimes lend it
to the space cadet down the hall.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.557
I mean, there’s a thousand ways
I could have been hacked.

23:12.766 --> 23:15.143
Yeah, all of which, we’ll be looking into.

23:15.268 --> 23:17.479
-Fine.
-We need your computer.

23:17.687 --> 23:19.398
GREG: And the name
of the space cadet down the hall

23:19.481 --> 23:21.149
and who you bought the computer from.

23:24.027 --> 23:25.237
So, let me get this straight, Kelvin.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.696
-You stole the car?
-Right.

23:26.780 --> 23:28.532
-But you didn’t do the hit-and-run?
-Exactly.

23:28.698 --> 23:31.868
-(SCOFFS) How’s that work?
-KELVIN: I’m walking down the street,

23:31.952 --> 23:34.579
and I see this white boy,
pull up in this dope SUV.

23:34.704 --> 23:36.456
And he hopped out
and headed around the corner.

23:36.748 --> 23:40.919
With the doors open, the keys in it.
It’s like he was asking me to steal it.

23:41.002 --> 23:42.003
So I did.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.673
And you were driving,
and these, uh, these Italians cut you off.

23:44.840 --> 23:48.468
And start beating the hell out of me.
I figure it’s ’cause I stole the truck.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.430
If you boosted this car
on Elizabeth Street, like you say,

23:51.513 --> 23:53.807
what were you doing
in Little Italy to begin with?

23:54.015 --> 23:55.934
-I was looking for my wallet.
-Yeah, huh?

23:56.184 --> 23:59.104
I’m at a bar down
in the village, last night... Tricky’s.

23:59.312 --> 24:01.481
I start talking to this white chick,
Anne Marie.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.400
She invites me back to her place.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.819
I’m thinking maybe she got the fever,
I don't know.

24:05.986 --> 24:08.447
But we get there,
and I’m already drunk as it is.

24:08.655 --> 24:11.658
But now she lights up
some weed... that was it.

24:11.783 --> 24:13.618
I passed out on the futon.

24:13.702 --> 24:16.204
-When’d you leave her place?
-About 5:00 a.m.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.373
It was still dark out,
which is gonna factor in later...

24:18.457 --> 24:19.458
All right, get to it, Kelvin.

24:19.541 --> 24:22.919
So I head home, but when I get there,
I realize I don’t have my wallet on me.

24:23.378 --> 24:25.755
So, I go all the way back to Anne Marie’s.

24:25.881 --> 24:29.092
The problem is, I don’t know
where she live exactly.

24:29.551 --> 24:33.138
’Cause it was dark out when I left,
and I was still half drunk anyhow.

24:33.889 --> 24:36.516
The next thing I see is the SUV,
with the keys in it.

24:36.725 --> 24:39.811
-What’s this Anne Marie’s Last name?
-I don’t know. I never got it.

24:40.353 --> 24:42.397
What are the cross streets
where Anne Marie lives?

24:42.522 --> 24:44.232
I don’t know that, either.
I wish to hell I did.

24:44.524 --> 24:46.693
But your wallet’s still gonna be
at this Anne Marie’s apartment.

24:46.985 --> 24:48.737
No, see, 'cause here’s the thing.

24:49.029 --> 24:51.364
After I got attacked
and when I was walking around

24:51.490 --> 24:52.908
trying to figure out what to do.

24:53.033 --> 24:55.118
I felt something in my jacket
in this pocket up here.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.746
-And it was my wallet.
-(SCOFFS) Amazing.

24:58.038 --> 25:01.291
See, I never put it there.
So I must’ve been drunk last night.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.877
So, in other words,
there’s no way of proving that story.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.379
-It’s the truth.
-I’m starting to think it ain’t, Kelvin.

25:06.463 --> 25:09.007
We got a witness, who puts you behind
the wheel of that SUV,

25:09.216 --> 25:10.217
at the scene f the accident.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.968
They got the wrong brother,
plain and simple.

25:12.052 --> 25:13.512
ANDY: ’Cause you’re just
an innocent by-stander,

25:13.762 --> 25:16.973
looking for a mystery apartment,
so you can find your lost wallet,

25:17.057 --> 25:19.476
which wasn’t really lost to begin with.

25:19.726 --> 25:21.144
Yo, is this a ride?

25:21.436 --> 25:23.855
Like, is this getting shoved down
my throat no matter what I say?

25:24.064 --> 25:25.899
Kelvin, you need to keep
in mind one thing.

25:26.024 --> 25:29.569
If you keep lying, the family
of that little girl, who got killed,

25:29.653 --> 25:31.821
are gonna stay pissed off at you.

25:31.947 --> 25:34.074
And we’re not gonna be there
to watch your back,

25:34.157 --> 25:35.450
every day, the rest of your life.

25:35.617 --> 25:39.287
So show remorse, admit what you did.
It’s the best way for you.

25:39.454 --> 25:41.206
ANDY: And if you don’t believe us, Kelvin,

25:41.289 --> 25:45.210
ask your mom, if those were real bullets
shot through her window this morning.

25:45.502 --> 25:47.837
I was looking for a girl
named Anne Marie...

25:47.921 --> 25:49.839
I don’t wanna hear
that bullshit story again.

25:50.090 --> 25:52.133
If did it, I’d tell you. But it wasn’t me.

25:52.217 --> 25:54.261
You’re making a big mistake, Kelvin.

25:54.469 --> 25:56.346
Only God can judge me.

25:56.513 --> 25:58.598
Well, you hold on to that.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.183
Hey.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.269
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

26:05.730 --> 26:08.400
-Kelvin George?
-He’s denying it. Big surprise.

26:08.525 --> 26:10.694
-We’ll go back at him in a bit.
-Good.

26:10.860 --> 26:11.945
(SIGHS)

26:15.490 --> 26:17.325
-What’s the story?
-Retiring?

26:17.617 --> 26:20.537
-No, your choice of tie.
-It’s just time.

26:20.829 --> 26:24.332
-Don’t go selling that weak crap to me.
-There’s no hoodwink here, Andy.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.960
-Is it Ortiz?
-What do you know about that?

26:27.127 --> 26:29.087
It was a hunch I had,
but you just confirmed it.

26:29.254 --> 26:32.132
There’s nothing going on,
but if it were, it’d be a private matter.

26:32.257 --> 26:35.010
And this, uh, security gig,
this guy you're working for,

26:35.176 --> 26:37.178
I’m sure he was real sweet
at the interview.

26:37.345 --> 26:39.973
But it’s just a matter of time
before you’re snapping up whores for him.

26:40.140 --> 26:41.141
(DRAWER CLOSING)

26:41.224 --> 26:44.853
Who knows? I’m already signed on, so...

26:45.520 --> 26:47.355
Then this is ’cause
you got dropped off the list

26:47.480 --> 26:48.565
for captain’s pay?

26:48.857 --> 26:51.109
It tells me I’m not getting
any further on the job.

26:51.192 --> 26:53.069
That’s a punk move.

26:53.737 --> 26:57.115
Never once in my life
have I punked out of anything.

26:57.240 --> 27:00.785
If you cared about this job,
If it had any meaning to you at all,

27:00.952 --> 27:03.455
-you’d turn it back on them and fight.
-I don’t wanna leave.

27:03.663 --> 27:06.541
But I gave the department
everything for 18 years.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.710
I took a bullet, and they let me down.

27:08.835 --> 27:10.003
(DOOR KNOCKING)

27:10.462 --> 27:13.798
Got a call from Bellevue.
Ray Espinoza, the guy on the bike,

27:13.965 --> 27:15.425
he’s in recovery and alert.

27:16.843 --> 27:17.927
(DOOR CLOSING)

27:20.722 --> 27:23.183
You still wanna be updated,
or did the bus already leave?

27:23.475 --> 27:26.853
Yes, I wanna be updated,
and don’t push me anymore.

27:34.277 --> 27:35.695
-Ray Espinoza?
-Yeah.

27:35.945 --> 27:38.073
ANDY: Detectives from the 15th Squad.

27:38.615 --> 27:39.741
You made it.

27:39.991 --> 27:42.077
You think I’m bad?
You should see the truck.

27:42.243 --> 27:43.411
(CHUCKLES)

27:43.495 --> 27:45.830
Well, you got a lot of family outside,
waiting to see you.

27:45.914 --> 27:47.248
ANDY: First, real quick, though,

27:47.332 --> 27:49.834
did you get a look at the guy driving
the SUV, before he hit you?

27:49.959 --> 27:51.544
-Yeah.
-All right.

27:51.753 --> 27:53.713
We got a photo array,
we’re gonna show you.

27:53.922 --> 27:56.341
Tell us if you recognize the guy, okay?

27:57.717 --> 27:59.010
Driver was a white guy.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.221
We’re talking about the driver
of the SUV, who hit you.

28:01.304 --> 28:04.808
Yeah, white guy, young, dark hair.

28:05.058 --> 28:06.685
-You’re sure?
-Positive.

28:06.768 --> 28:08.895
I looked right at him
when he was coming at me.

28:09.145 --> 28:10.647
Was there a black guy
in the car at all?

28:10.730 --> 28:12.232
No, not in the front.

28:12.315 --> 28:15.402
Only guy I saw was the driver,
and he was white.

28:15.568 --> 28:16.861
(SIGHS)

28:29.165 --> 28:32.085
I’d just like you to know that my wife
hasn’t stopped crying all day.

28:32.168 --> 28:33.545
GREG: We’re sorry to hear that.

28:33.753 --> 28:35.797
You know, there’s a lot of ways
to do things in the world.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.882
You got a case to solve, I respect that.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.301
But stomping on the victim?
You got a lot of balls.

28:40.468 --> 28:42.220
Tell us about Courtney Bates.

28:42.887 --> 28:44.472
You know what? I don’t think
you’re listening to me.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.599
-You know the name?
-I can’t place it.

28:46.683 --> 28:48.184
Courtney Bates, blond hair,

28:48.268 --> 28:50.311
called your office 19 times
the last two weeks.

28:50.437 --> 28:51.771
GREG: Place it now?

28:51.855 --> 28:55.900
-(CHUCKLES) All right, what’s going on?
-BALDWIN: You having an affair with her?

28:55.984 --> 28:58.653
How does this pertain to catching the guy,
who raped my wife?

28:58.820 --> 29:00.405
We got the guy,
who raped your wife.

29:00.697 --> 29:04.826
But, he was duped on-line
into thinking he had her consent.

29:04.993 --> 29:07.579
What we need to figure out now is,
who put him up to it.

29:07.704 --> 29:09.247
You and Courtney or Courtney alone?

29:09.497 --> 29:12.751
Well, now, thi... this guy thought
he had consent and you believe that?

29:13.001 --> 29:14.919
Mr. Foster, if you wanna
keep yourself out of jail,

29:15.044 --> 29:16.546
you need to stop slapping back
everything we say

29:16.713 --> 29:17.964
and just answer the questions.

29:18.381 --> 29:21.134
Are you screwing Courtney Bates?
Yes or no.

29:23.178 --> 29:25.513
It’s more of an emotional intimacy.

29:27.515 --> 29:29.851
What’d I just say about answering
the questions?

29:29.976 --> 29:31.436
Okay, yes, fine.

29:31.519 --> 29:33.563
But... but I had no idea she would do
something like this.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.065
-She ever shown crazy behavior before?
-No.

29:36.191 --> 29:37.650
Has she ever threatened to do harm

29:37.817 --> 29:39.277
-to your wife in any way?
-No.

29:39.486 --> 29:40.987
Did you put thoughts
into Courtney’s head about

29:41.070 --> 29:43.281
what life would be like
if your wife was out of the picture?

29:43.698 --> 29:46.910
-No, no way.
-You understand, if that were true,

29:47.118 --> 29:49.078
you’d be the first guy banging around
on his wife who didn’t.

29:49.204 --> 29:52.123
I swear to you, Courtney and I
had a mutual agreement,

29:52.248 --> 29:54.459
sex and nothing else.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.294
Look, I love my wife.

29:57.587 --> 30:00.757
-She’s just old-fashioned.
-As far as fidelity and what not?

30:01.049 --> 30:02.425
In the bedroom.

30:04.177 --> 30:06.221
She’s puritanical.

30:06.429 --> 30:09.682
But I never meant for her
to be raped, and... (SIGHS)

30:09.766 --> 30:12.143
...if Courtney had anything to do
with this, she can go to hell.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.729
All right, go be with your wife.

30:15.146 --> 30:18.691
But if we call and you’re not there,
she hears about Courtney.

-May I help you?

Afternoon, Detectives Clark and Sipowicz.
Have you been here all day?

30:35.124 --> 30:36.125
Yes.

30:36.209 --> 30:38.711
Uh, we’ve been told that there
was a car stolen this morning.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.797
A big, silver SUV,
from right out front here.

30:40.922 --> 30:41.965
Did you happen to see it?

30:42.048 --> 30:45.552
To stay in business in this neighborhood,
you got to mind your own business.

30:45.635 --> 30:48.221
See, uh, the thing is, ma’am,
the owner of the car,

30:48.346 --> 30:50.306
he’s an elderly man,
who bought it for his kids.

30:50.390 --> 30:53.184
And, uh, the insurance company
is refusing to pay

30:53.309 --> 30:55.687
because the story doesn’t add up, uh,

30:55.812 --> 30:58.147
he’s saying that a white kid stole it.

30:58.314 --> 31:01.234
But ultimately a black guy,
was found driving it.

31:01.317 --> 31:03.361
We’re just trying
to straighten everything out.

31:03.444 --> 31:06.114
So this has nothing to do with Tony
Grimaldi’s daughter being killed?

31:06.447 --> 31:08.700
(CLEARS THROAT) Uh, it might.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.368
Then why didn’t you just come out
and say it?

31:10.618 --> 31:12.829
Because everybody’s been lying
to us today.

31:13.121 --> 31:17.166
And if everybody keeps on lying,
an innocent guy is gonna get killed.

31:17.625 --> 31:20.920
A boy from the neighborhood.
Something of a hoodlum,

31:21.004 --> 31:23.590
parked it out front here,
and then he ran off.

31:23.673 --> 31:27.802
A minute or so later, a young black man
got in and drove away.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.221
The boy from the neighborhood,
what’s his name?

31:30.388 --> 31:33.474
The old man and his insurance...
you’re a good liar.

I apologize for not being
completely up front.

I’m gonna tell you what I know.

-But I’ll never talk about it again.
-Okay.

in a police station before this morning,

32:01.336 --> 32:02.462
-have you, Courtney?
-No.

32:02.879 --> 32:05.924
Then we’ll just chalk up
all the lying you did then,

32:06.007 --> 32:08.051
to, uh, an ignorance of the process.

32:08.259 --> 32:11.012
I’m sorry, but what are you talking about?

32:11.346 --> 32:13.848

you never brought up.

-What are you? Three years old?
-Well, you didn’t.

All right, we’ll make this simple then.
You choose between A,

you plotted Michelle Foster’s rape
and don’t give a damn.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.654
Or B, it was a prank
that got out of control.

32:29.489 --> 32:31.950
-B.
-How’d it start?

32:32.492 --> 32:36.579
Well, she’s controlling and manipulative,
and she uses the fact

32:36.663 --> 32:38.414
that he’s a decent guy
to get what she wants.

32:38.539 --> 32:40.708
You know all this
about a woman you’ve never met?

32:40.792 --> 32:42.669
-Jason told me.
-Got it.

32:42.752 --> 32:46.255
He’s a successful stock-broker,
and he needs to be in New York.

32:46.339 --> 32:48.633
But she keeps whining
about moving back to North Carolina.

32:49.050 --> 32:51.302
What else did Jason say about his wife?

32:51.886 --> 32:55.473
They, uh, stopped having sex
a month after getting married.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.810
She takes pills, drinks all the time.
He’s miserable.

32:58.893 --> 33:00.812
How’d you get the idea
of the rape chat room?

33:01.062 --> 33:03.022
One night I, um...

33:03.231 --> 33:05.733
I had too much sangria
with some girlfriends.

33:05.900 --> 33:08.736
And I just thought maybe a little scare,
might give her some motivation.

33:08.820 --> 33:11.614
So I went online. It was a joke.

33:11.906 --> 33:13.741
Did you discuss your joke with Jason?

33:13.866 --> 33:17.161
If it worked and she moved out,
I was gonna tell him.

33:17.537 --> 33:20.289
And then you’d, uh,
get married and be happy together?

33:20.456 --> 33:22.041
I don’t know. Maybe.

33:22.792 --> 33:27.088
I didn’t mean for her to get raped.
That was absolutely not my intention.

33:27.380 --> 33:29.590
Now, I’m sorry if it went too far.

33:29.674 --> 33:35.388
I’ll... do whatever you want me to do.
I’ll write a note, uh, apologize, okay?

33:35.596 --> 33:39.892
-Can I leave now?
-Courtney, you’re not going anywhere.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.645
-You’re under arrest.
-What?

33:43.104 --> 33:44.147

-GIO: Why?
-You his dad?

33:58.870 --> 34:00.204
Yeah. What do you need Danny for?

34:00.288 --> 34:02.331
We heard he might be a witness
to the hit-and-run.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.000
Yeah, he would’ve said something
to me if he did.

34:04.125 --> 34:05.710
We need to talk to your kid.

34:06.502 --> 34:07.587
Come in.

34:10.006 --> 34:11.799
GIO: Danny, get out here!

34:12.175 --> 34:14.469
-Heard you got Kelvin George in custody.
-JOHN: That’s right.

34:14.552 --> 34:16.179
Yeah, he better stay there
if he knows what’s good for him.

34:16.262 --> 34:17.472
Kelvin didn’t do the hit-and-run.

34:17.638 --> 34:19.807
Oh, here we go, what? Al Sharpton
have a protest march or something?

34:19.932 --> 34:21.267
DANNY: Yeah, Dad?

34:21.350 --> 34:22.393
GIO: You didn’t see that hit-and-run

34:22.477 --> 34:23.519
-this morning, did you?
-No.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.938
Been busted before, right, Danny?
Grand larceny auto?

34:26.022 --> 34:27.106
Oh, what’s that about?

34:27.190 --> 34:30.860
We got a witness saw you dump that SUV
on Broome off Lafayette this morning.

34:30.943 --> 34:32.862
Then Kelvin hopped in
and took it from there.

34:32.987 --> 34:35.740
But it was you that hit Theresa Grimaldi
and that guy on the bike.

34:35.990 --> 34:37.283
-Isn't that right?
-GIO: Don’t even think about

34:37.366 --> 34:39.702
pinning this on my son.
He didn't do nothing.

34:39.786 --> 34:41.871
-Danny, right?
-Right.

34:42.038 --> 34:44.707
Okay, then the next step
is running a lineup.

34:44.791 --> 34:47.460
Matching your son’s fingerprints
with what we got off the car,

34:47.543 --> 34:50.630
comparing DNO from hair
we got off the driver’s seat.

34:50.797 --> 34:54.050
-You’re gonna wanna avoid all that.
-Danny, you didn’t do this.

34:54.258 --> 34:56.177
He did do it, and all your
douchebag buddies,

34:56.260 --> 34:58.262
that you were going after
Kelvin George with,

34:58.346 --> 35:00.389
are gonna know Danny’s
who we’re looking at.

35:00.556 --> 35:03.643
So if he don’t come clean
and start protecting himself, right now,

35:03.810 --> 35:05.686
it’s gonna be open season.

35:08.481 --> 35:10.942
-It was an accident.
-Oh, my God.

35:11.067 --> 35:14.946
I was partying uptown with some guys.
And we took the car for fun.

35:15.321 --> 35:18.199
I was on my way home,
and I thought I saw a cop behind me.

35:18.282 --> 35:20.701
So I turned onto Broome and I gunned it.

35:21.035 --> 35:22.161
It was an accident.

35:22.286 --> 35:24.122
We’re gonna have to take him in,
Mr. Puglisi.

35:24.330 --> 35:26.124
What’s Mr. Grimaldi gonna do to me, Dad?

35:26.332 --> 35:27.959
I’ll talk to Tony.
I’ll make it right with him.

35:28.042 --> 35:30.086
Before he hears from someone else.

35:32.463 --> 35:35.133
Your son will be
at the 15th precinct, Mr. Puglisi.

-You have our word.

35:46.477 --> 35:49.814
Any question as to whether
Courtney Bates acted with malice?

35:49.897 --> 35:51.107
Going into that chat room,

35:51.190 --> 35:53.609
she absolutely expected
that something bad

35:53.693 --> 35:55.528
was going to happen to Michelle Foster.

35:55.611 --> 35:58.406
Then it’s conspiracy
to commit rape or rape by proxy.

35:58.489 --> 35:59.824
Either way, she’s a collar.

35:59.907 --> 36:01.826
Is it worth pursuing the husband
for putting the idea in her head?

36:01.909 --> 36:05.496
Sounds like he was telling
Courtney lies about his wife,

36:05.580 --> 36:09.000
to keep her in the sack. I mean,
he’s a dog, but it’s not criminal.

36:09.208 --> 36:11.377
What about the guy who did the rape?
Reese?

36:11.502 --> 36:13.880
I mean, this is a bad guy,
with bad instincts.

36:13.963 --> 36:16.674
Still, it boils down to consent.
And from everything you’re telling me,

36:17.008 --> 36:19.844
-Reese thought he had it.
-So, we get him on the next one?

36:20.094 --> 36:23.139
I’ll see that it’s put in front
of the grand jury with your statements.

36:23.306 --> 36:24.891
Still, he could walk.

36:25.308 --> 36:28.144

36:35.693 --> 36:37.403
I’ll have the warrant vacated.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.030
