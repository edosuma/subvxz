Now she is nasty.

20:59.202 --> 21:02.122
Either she has changed
or I have changed.

21:06.002 --> 21:07.922
She once loved you.

21:09.082 --> 21:10.722
Not anymore.

21:11.362 --> 21:13.002
Even I could see that much.

21:28.762 --> 21:30.962
I hate the forest.

21:42.202 --> 21:43.802
Where is your wife?

21:46.282 --> 21:48.722
I know you are married
to the lady Mildrith.

21:54.562 --> 21:57.162
She will have sought refuge...

21:58.722 --> 22:00.042
...with the church.

22:03.202 --> 22:05.362
She used to come to the nunnery.

22:07.402 --> 22:08.842
I would pray with her.

22:09.802 --> 22:12.322
I watched her as she changed.

22:17.442 --> 22:19.202
Why does a woman become a nun?

22:22.322 --> 22:24.802
Because of her love for God.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.482
God will never abandon her.

22:28.642 --> 22:31.642
You were being humped
against your will.

22:33.482 --> 22:35.282
Where was God?

22:38.362 --> 22:39.882
He sent you.

22:47.322 --> 22:51.442
- Is the king likely to have been killed?
- The king is not our concern.

22:51.602 --> 22:53.842
If the king is dead,
then Wessex is dead.

23:03.842 --> 23:06.962
- Where are you going?
- (ISEULT) I need darkness.

23:07.882 --> 23:09.922
She needs darkness for what?

23:11.482 --> 23:13.202
To see.

23:15.802 --> 23:17.202
(LEOFRIC CHUCKLES)

23:23.442 --> 23:25.282
(HILD) Leofric, where are we?

23:26.202 --> 23:29.642
(LEOFRIC) We are at the marshlands
of the Severn. The swamplands.

23:30.442 --> 23:32.802
I have never seen lands
like this before.

23:39.362 --> 23:42.442
(MAN) Hurry. They've seen us.
The boat won't wait.

23:42.602 --> 23:45.802
- Priests.
- (MAN) Come quickly, we need to leave.

23:48.002 --> 23:51.242
- In fear.
- (HILD) God preserve us.

23:51.402 --> 23:52.762
Time to fight, arseling.

23:57.682 --> 24:00.562
(VIKING SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)

24:00.762 --> 24:02.442
Unh!

24:07.442 --> 24:09.122
Ah!

24:15.282 --> 24:16.842
Uhtred!

24:17.042 --> 24:18.642
(HORSE NEIGHING)

24:27.402 --> 24:29.562
Arseling!

24:30.522 --> 24:32.562
(UHTRED) I have your sword.

24:42.722 --> 24:44.122
(VIKINGS YELLING INDISTINCTLY)

24:45.682 --> 24:47.802
(VIKING) We'll get you!

24:49.602 --> 24:53.682
I hope you're carrying silver, priest.
We've saved your life.

24:53.842 --> 24:57.162
(ALFRED)
I am saved by ghosts, it seems.

24:57.922 --> 24:59.722
Lord.

25:00.642 --> 25:03.522
- Thank God you are unhurt.
- (ALFRED) I was blessed.

25:03.682 --> 25:07.922
- And your family?
- Are safe, they are in the boat ahead.

25:08.082 --> 25:11.962
Hoping to find sanctuary
in these marshlands.

25:14.482 --> 25:17.162
At the palace, lord,
they came from nowhere.

25:18.442 --> 25:20.122
- They did.
- They came

25:20.282 --> 25:21.842
because they were allowed to.

25:22.402 --> 25:25.282
Where were your watchers?
Your spies?

25:25.722 --> 25:27.402
On their knees, no doubt.

25:27.562 --> 25:29.242
You should show respect.

25:29.402 --> 25:31.762
Wessex allows its warriors
to kill each other

25:31.922 --> 25:33.922
and spends too much time
on its knees.

25:34.082 --> 25:36.122
Too much money on its churches.

25:36.282 --> 25:39.602
If Guthrum were Christian
and not Pagan, there would be no war.

25:39.762 --> 25:42.962
- But he's not.
- You do well to remember I am king.

25:43.122 --> 25:46.962
- King of what? Look around you.
- He is our king.

25:47.122 --> 25:50.522
Like every kingdom before it,
Wessex has fallen.

25:50.682 --> 25:53.922
He's Alfred, a man.

25:54.082 --> 25:55.682
King of nothing.

26:52.322 --> 26:54.482
(EDWARD COUGHING AND CRYING)

27:01.322 --> 27:05.122
Lord God, allow your blessed oils
to penetrate

27:05.282 --> 27:09.482
and take away any
and all fever and sickness.

27:09.642 --> 27:13.402
Restore health and strength
to the child

27:13.562 --> 27:15.962
and to his ever watchful parents.

27:16.122 --> 27:18.082
- Amen.
- Amen.

27:18.242 --> 27:20.202
Amen.

27:20.962 --> 27:23.162
(AELSWITH) Shh-shh-shh.

27:23.322 --> 27:26.322
(EDWARD COUGHING AND CRYING)

27:47.842 --> 27:50.962
(ISEULT) Lord, I have prepared a tonic.
For the pain.

27:52.882 --> 27:54.842
For the pain you suffer here.

27:56.122 --> 27:58.202
You pass blood? From your arse?

28:05.402 --> 28:09.082
It is nothing more than what grows
from the earth, lord, drink it.

28:20.082 --> 28:23.362
- It is good?
- Oh, not at all.

28:26.242 --> 28:29.002
- Thank you.
- There will be more tomorrow.

28:38.402 --> 28:42.482
He will become lost, I guarantee it.

28:57.282 --> 29:00.202
Were you worried
that I would lose my way?

29:00.562 --> 29:03.162
One path looks like another.

29:03.322 --> 29:06.962
- You have explored?
- A little.

29:08.762 --> 29:12.242
What do you notice about this place?

29:13.602 --> 29:15.362
(UHTRED) It is Wet.

29:15.802 --> 29:17.242
(ALFRED) There are no horizons.

29:18.322 --> 29:21.202
No sense of something beyond.

29:22.522 --> 29:26.402
My priests have visited here
once or twice, to preach.

29:26.562 --> 29:29.442
The people are oblivious to God.

29:34.522 --> 29:36.282
You look tired.

29:37.162 --> 29:39.442
Sleep has been a rarity, yes.

29:42.402 --> 29:45.402
My wife would like us to take a ship
to Frankia.

29:45.562 --> 29:49.962
- To become another king in exile?
- So you admit I am still a king?

29:52.402 --> 29:54.562
We dare not travel.

29:55.682 --> 29:58.682
My son would never survive it.

30:06.322 --> 30:08.762
You should send out word
that you are alive,

30:08.922 --> 30:11.602
asking men to join you, to follow you.

30:11.762 --> 30:13.962
And then what? Fight?

30:14.402 --> 30:17.082
- Is that what you would do?
- It's what a king would do.

30:19.322 --> 30:22.042
I have given it thought,
of course I have,

30:22.522 --> 30:24.602
and this much I know:

30:25.362 --> 30:29.762
If I am to fight, it would have to be
a single battle and soon.

30:29.922 --> 30:32.242
Before yet more Danes arrive,

30:32.762 --> 30:34.362
before Wessex crumbles,

30:34.522 --> 30:37.562
skirmish by skirmish, raid by raid,
piece by piece.

30:37.722 --> 30:41.442
Therefore the first task would be

30:42.242 --> 30:46.122
to somehow convince the Danes
to hold

30:46.282 --> 30:49.242
one great and deciding moment.

30:51.362 --> 30:54.442
- A single defining battle.
- Yes.

30:55.442 --> 30:57.282
Who should I send?

30:57.442 --> 31:00.162
Out into the country
with the news I am here.

31:00.322 --> 31:02.962
It would be your priests, all of them,
each in a separate direction.

31:03.122 --> 31:04.802
Their prayers are needed here.

31:07.562 --> 31:10.882
Your son grows weaker despite
their prayers.

31:12.202 --> 31:14.202
For that I am sorry.

31:26.882 --> 31:29.642
(AELSWITH)
Every breath is an effort for him.

31:30.682 --> 31:33.402
I don't know whether to make him warm
or keep him cool.

31:33.562 --> 31:34.882
(EDWARD CRYING)

31:35.042 --> 31:37.562
- Shh.
- We Will...

Shh.

31:59.042 --> 32:02.282
(EDWARD COUGHING AND CRYING)

32:12.442 --> 32:14.682
(UHTRED) Will the child die?

32:17.762 --> 32:19.082
Can you save him?

32:23.162 --> 32:24.482
There is a way...

32:26.562 --> 32:28.922
...though it is not a good way.

32:30.842 --> 32:34.282
If it is the only way, then you must.

32:47.842 --> 32:50.162
You are feeling a little better, lord?

32:51.282 --> 32:52.842
I am.

32:57.162 --> 32:59.522
Iseult is a healer.

33:01.842 --> 33:03.842
She could help your son.

33:07.882 --> 33:09.202
Thank you.

33:16.882 --> 33:21.722
If you help, then you better succeed.
If the child dies, you will be blamed.

33:21.882 --> 33:25.242
- We cannot do nothing.
- (HILD) That is not what I am saying.

33:25.402 --> 33:30.002
Iseult is a pagan and a woman.
She will be blamed,

33:30.162 --> 33:32.482
regardless of her meaning well.

33:41.682 --> 33:44.202
If it is true that Alfred
is in the swampland,

33:44.362 --> 33:46.842
how long do we wait for him
to come out?

33:47.002 --> 33:49.962
If he is hiding in the Swampland,
we would be fools to go searching.

33:50.122 --> 33:52.362
Have you ever seen anything like this?

33:52.922 --> 33:56.162
- Monasteries keep words like this.
- No, no. Not like this.

33:56.322 --> 33:58.242
What does it all mean?

33:58.682 --> 34:03.762
- What does all this speak of?
- I cannot say I care.

34:03.922 --> 34:07.242
Whatever Alfred found out
about his enemies, he would write.

34:07.682 --> 34:12.242
- Yeah. It's magic. Yeah, it is.
- (BRIDA LAUGHS)

34:12.402 --> 34:15.081
- (GUTHRUM) You are laughing.
- It's a weak kind of magic.

34:15.242 --> 34:20.362
No, you are wrong.
This is words without sound.

34:20.522 --> 34:22.442
This is voices without people.

34:22.601 --> 34:25.641
I'm going to learn how to use
this magic.

34:25.802 --> 34:29.042
(RAGNAR)
If we took Alfred, he could teach you.

34:29.802 --> 34:34.362
Only a fool would march an army
into a swampland.

34:34.522 --> 34:36.562
Are you that fool?

34:42.922 --> 34:46.322
Are you that fool, Ragnar?

34:46.482 --> 34:48.282
No, I am not.

34:49.842 --> 34:51.601
Then we wait.

35:07.282 --> 35:09.362
We need to be closer.

35:13.762 --> 35:15.842
(ARROW THUMPS AND DEER YELPS)

35:39.202 --> 35:41.362
The water is rising.

35:50.642 --> 35:55.482
(ISEULT) Lord, you had one task.
(ALFRED) Oh, no. I am sorry.

35:55.842 --> 35:59.162
I've never cooked before,
and never again, I fear.

35:59.922 --> 36:02.762
- Are they burned?
- They are done well, lord,

36:02.922 --> 36:05.442
a challenge for your teeth
and stomach.

36:07.002 --> 36:09.322
I've seen a fleet on the Severn.

36:10.202 --> 36:11.922
They carry Skorpa's colours.

36:12.082 --> 36:15.162
- How many ships?
- (UHTRED) Twenty or more.

36:16.682 --> 36:19.402
(ALFRED) That's over 1000 men.

36:19.562 --> 36:22.602
- Guthrum will have the same.
- More.

36:22.762 --> 36:25.922
- God save us.
- We can save ourselves.

36:26.682 --> 36:28.202
We must believe it.

(SHUSHING)

36:31.362 --> 36:33.322
(EDWARD COUGHING AND CRYING)

36:35.402 --> 36:37.402
Will the lady be joining us, lord?

36:39.122 --> 36:40.802
No. She will not.

36:40.962 --> 36:44.522
She is angry with me still,
for sending away the priests.

36:45.002 --> 36:48.042
(UHTRED) Sending out the priests
was the right thing, lord.

36:48.522 --> 36:51.002
Let us pray you are correct.

36:51.762 --> 36:53.682
If you will excuse me.

36:57.482 --> 37:01.322
If the child dies, it will take the fight
from Alfred's bones...

37:02.322 --> 37:04.682
...and we will never save ourselves.

37:13.642 --> 37:16.402
(EDWARD WHEEZING AND COUGHING)

37:19.882 --> 37:21.202
Aelswith.

37:22.802 --> 37:25.442
You must end this silence.

37:27.162 --> 37:28.602
The priests will fetch men.

37:28.762 --> 37:33.442
Without men, safe passage to the south
and Frankia will be impossible.

37:35.002 --> 37:38.882
At best, our children
would be taken as slaves.

37:47.882 --> 37:49.962
You are eating meat.

37:50.242 --> 37:51.562
Why?

37:51.722 --> 37:53.762
These last few days,
the pains have abated.

37:53.922 --> 37:58.682
Meat does not agree.
I could not cope with further sickness.

38:04.362 --> 38:06.922
In the mind of Brother Asser,
she is a witch

38:07.722 --> 38:10.202
and yet you gladly drink her potions.

38:10.362 --> 38:12.442
- It is a tonic.
- I can read you.

38:12.602 --> 38:15.882
You wish to put our child
in the hands of the devil.

38:16.042 --> 38:18.282
Our prayers are not being answered.

38:18.442 --> 38:22.122
Is it any wonder we find ourselves
living in a muddy puddle?

38:23.922 --> 38:25.482

38:46.082 --> 38:48.682
Father, please.
Come and sit by the fire.

38:48.842 --> 38:51.282
I bring word. From the king.

38:59.682 --> 39:01.082
He lives?

39:02.242 --> 39:04.682
Wessex lives and breathes,
Wulfhere.

39:04.882 --> 39:06.522
Thank God.

39:24.322 --> 39:25.962
(AELSWITH) Oh, my goodness.

39:26.722 --> 39:29.522
She has the nerve to approach.

39:29.682 --> 39:31.082
She has helped me.

39:31.882 --> 39:34.522
(EDWARD CRYING)

39:34.682 --> 39:36.282
(ALFRED) Thank you.

39:38.122 --> 39:42.442
I for one do not wish
to hear your voice.

39:42.602 --> 39:44.562
Do not speak a word.

39:48.642 --> 39:51.442
Is there something
you wish to say, lseult?

39:52.522 --> 39:54.762
(EDWARD COUGHING)

39:54.922 --> 39:58.642
If you wish, lord,
I will try to help your child.

39:59.442 --> 40:02.442
- We do not wish.
- Tonight is a good night.

40:02.602 --> 40:05.202
We do not wish.

40:05.362 --> 40:09.362
- Tomorrow it will be too late.
- What kind of talk is that?

40:09.522 --> 40:12.962
What kind of talk is "too late"?

40:13.282 --> 40:15.242
Are you saying that my child
will die?

40:15.402 --> 40:18.282
- (ALFRED) Aelswith. Aelswith, please.
- Get her away from me.

40:18.442 --> 40:21.202
Get her away from me!
Get out of my sight!

40:21.362 --> 40:23.642
- (ALFRED) Stop.
- Get her out of my sight!

40:23.802 --> 40:25.122
She is offering help.

40:25.282 --> 40:27.162
My priests told me
that you are a witch

40:27.322 --> 40:28.602
- and they are correct!
- She is no witch!

40:28.762 --> 40:32.122
- (ALFRED) Aelswith, please, no more.
- No, please, no!

40:32.282 --> 40:35.242
You are upsetting yourself
and you are upsetting the children.

40:36.122 --> 40:38.882
(EDWARD CRYING)

40:41.802 --> 40:43.842
(AELSWITH) Please. No, no, no. No.

40:44.002 --> 40:45.522
Please.

40:54.122 --> 40:56.882
Iseult, you must prepare.

40:57.082 --> 40:59.282
(SHUSHING)

41:01.322 --> 41:03.202
Lord.

41:03.602 --> 41:05.842
It can only be tonight.

41:08.362 --> 41:10.282
She will be ready.

41:10.602 --> 41:12.762
(EDWARD CRYING)

41:13.842 --> 41:15.682
Shh-shh-shh.

41:35.642 --> 41:38.562
The child will pass from one chamber...

41:39.642 --> 41:41.202
...to the other.

41:42.002 --> 41:44.362
From near death to life.

41:46.762 --> 41:48.202
(ISEULT slel-ls)

41:51.482 --> 41:52.802
What is it?

41:54.602 --> 41:56.882
If this child is to live,

41:57.522 --> 42:00.162
then another, somewhere, must die.

42:03.282 --> 42:05.442
I will be taking a life,

42:06.122 --> 42:08.522
a stranger, an innocent.

42:09.242 --> 42:10.962
Iseult...

42:14.242 --> 42:16.162
...this must be done.

42:34.602 --> 42:36.162
Lady Aelswith?

42:37.762 --> 42:39.482
Leave me.

42:42.802 --> 42:44.522
Icannot

42:44.962 --> 42:47.682
- Leave me.
- Lady...

42:49.522 --> 42:51.602
You need comfort.

43:03.322 --> 43:05.762
When a child suffers...

43:07.882 --> 43:09.962
...the mother suffers.

43:11.882 --> 43:13.602
I know this.

43:14.962 --> 43:17.322
I know the pain you feel.

43:19.002 --> 43:21.362
It's almost unbearable.

43:22.762 --> 43:24.362
Even for a queen.

43:26.562 --> 43:29.362
I will stay only for as long
as you need me,

43:29.522 --> 43:32.682
for a moment or a year.

43:36.802 --> 43:39.362
He is dying.

43:40.962 --> 43:43.002
(sesame)

43:49.202 --> 43:51.562
She is a pagan.

43:52.682 --> 43:56.002
And yet she has helped the king.

43:57.522 --> 44:02.162
I am to trust a stranger with my child.

44:11.922 --> 44:15.202
There is good in lseult.

44:33.602 --> 44:35.482
I don't know what is worse,

44:36.402 --> 44:37.802
when he cries or when he is still.

44:37.962 --> 44:40.882
When he is still,
I feel the need to prod him awake.

44:43.162 --> 44:46.682
- It is retribution. God is punishing me.
- For what?

44:46.842 --> 44:49.002
For Aethelwold for taking his crown.

44:49.162 --> 44:52.402
Aethelwold is a fool,
he could never be king.

44:52.642 --> 44:54.122
Your God is testing you.

44:57.042 --> 44:59.282
Lord, give Edward to lseult.

45:01.562 --> 45:03.522
If God will not cure Edward,

45:03.682 --> 45:08.722
what makes you think that
he would allow a pagan to succeed?

45:25.122 --> 45:29.002
Who is to say that God is not working
through us all?

45:29.962 --> 45:31.802
Did he not make the pagans too?

45:34.082 --> 45:39.842
Beocca would tell me that
God's ways are known only to himself.

45:42.482 --> 45:45.082
You have been brought to the marshes
for a reason.

45:46.042 --> 45:49.002
You have this one chance
to save your son,

45:49.162 --> 45:51.762
and you will have one chance
to save your kingdom.

45:51.922 --> 45:54.722
The two are bound together.

45:56.322 --> 45:58.722
Edward is your heir.

46:00.162 --> 46:04.562
If he lives, I would say it is a sign...

46:06.242 --> 46:07.602
...Wessex will live.

46:07.762 --> 46:09.802
(EDWARD WHEEZING)

46:09.962 --> 46:11.362
Shh.

46:18.162 --> 46:21.162
There is barely a heartbeat.

46:23.202 --> 46:26.402
Let me give the child to lseult.

46:47.282 --> 46:50.362
May God have mercy on each of us.

47:12.762 --> 47:15.082
Where is he taking him?

47:15.682 --> 47:17.882
Am I allowed to know?

47:18.922 --> 47:20.722
To lseult.

47:22.602 --> 47:24.722
God is watching.

48:07.562 --> 48:09.162
(BEOCCA) Lord?

48:12.322 --> 48:13.842
Lord?

48:15.082 --> 48:16.722
Good morning, lord.

48:16.882 --> 48:19.842
We received your message
and came as quickly as we could.

48:21.362 --> 48:25.162
- Father Beocca? ls that you?
- Yes, lord.

48:26.842 --> 48:30.042
- You are here?
- I am, lord.

48:35.522 --> 48:40.122
- You have brought men. Wulfhere.
- Lord.

48:42.922 --> 48:47.282
- Well, how warming it is to see you all.
- It's good to see you again, lord.

48:47.442 --> 48:49.362
And many more are nearby.

48:49.522 --> 48:53.122
Guards, men,
even the brother, Asser, is here.

48:53.282 --> 48:57.242
We have all been saying prayers
for your health and safety.

48:58.682 --> 49:02.162
- Praying? Yes.
- (BEOCCA) And for Edward, of course.

49:02.322 --> 49:04.642
Every priest in the land
has been instructed

49:04.802 --> 49:06.602
to hold service for his recovery.

49:09.122 --> 49:11.602
For Edward, I am blessed.

49:12.722 --> 49:15.122
(BEOCCA) How is the boy, lord?

49:17.242 --> 49:18.562
Edward.

49:21.522 --> 49:23.162
Lord?

49:24.322 --> 49:26.002
What is it, lord?

49:30.802 --> 49:33.562
(ALFRED)
Oh, please, God, please, God, no.

49:34.362 --> 49:36.642
Say he has not been taken from me.

49:36.802 --> 49:39.882
No, lord, this is not his grave.

49:41.402 --> 49:43.642
(EDWARD coome)

49:46.802 --> 49:49.362
- He is well, lord.
- What?

49:49.522 --> 49:52.962
(ISEULT) And he is healed.
(ALFRED) Healed?

49:53.842 --> 49:56.282
Lord, what is this?

49:58.562 --> 50:02.522
- It's good news, Father. Rejoice.
- (ALFRED) He is well.

50:04.322 --> 50:05.882
(ALFRED CHUCKLES)

50:06.482 --> 50:07.882
Oh.

50:08.202 --> 50:09.962
(ALFRED CHUCKLING)

50:10.122 --> 50:13.082
He is well. It is true. He's...

50:14.042 --> 50:16.362
He is well. He is cool.

50:16.522 --> 50:18.922
He is well, Beocca.

50:20.242 --> 50:23.962
I can feel his heart beating strongly.

50:24.122 --> 50:27.722
- God has not forsaken you, lord.
- Fetch Aelswith, fetch his mother!

50:27.882 --> 50:30.762
The prayers of the whole of Wessex
have been answered.

50:30.922 --> 50:33.002
- (ALFRED) Indeed.
- Every mass, lord,

50:33.162 --> 50:36.762
every mass said by 100 priests
or more has been heard.

50:36.922 --> 50:42.162
- Look at him. Look at him, he is well.
- God is good. Praise him!

50:47.722 --> 50:51.202
Yes, praise him, Father Beocca.

51:00.082 --> 51:03.642
You did well. Why the tears?

51:08.442 --> 51:11.362
They are for the stranger's child.

51:12.482 --> 51:13.842
(sesame)

52:11.002 --> 52:13.842
- (LEOFRIC) You are wet, arseling.
- I am.

52:14.002 --> 52:17.202
Wet, tired, but I have a plan.

52:17.562 --> 52:21.842
Lord, the ships are guarded
by no more than 6O men.

52:22.002 --> 52:25.242
The rest of the army will be inland
looking for food.

52:25.402 --> 52:27.602
We kill the men, we burn the ships.

52:27.762 --> 52:29.762
You really believe Skorpa will then
go to Guthrum?

52:29.922 --> 52:33.522
I do. One army, one battle.
It's the only way, lord.

52:36.042 --> 52:40.002
It begins here, in these waters.

52:44.002 --> 52:46.682
You were brought here for this reason,
lord.

53:15.202 --> 53:19.202
They need to give chase and they
need to believe they can reach us.

53:20.042 --> 53:23.402
We stand our ground
until the very last moment.

53:23.842 --> 53:29.442
Then we stay on the safe path and let
the land half kill them before we attack.

53:30.682 --> 53:32.722
And if they do reach us?

53:38.482 --> 53:39.962
Ready?

53:56.162 --> 53:59.962
Remember, don't kill them,
just make them mad.

God has tested you, lord.

57:21.762 --> 57:25.442
He has put you into the fire,
as a smith would his steel.

57:25.602 --> 57:28.682
And like the steel,
you have emerged stronger.

- Praise him, lord.
