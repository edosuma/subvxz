01:36.280 --> 01:39.272
My Purge playlist.

01:39.480 --> 01:43.473
I put a lot of thought into it,
especially this final tune

01:43.960 --> 01:46.679
as it will be the last
song you'll ever hear.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.193
Tough choice.

01:48.440 --> 01:51.671
And then I thought,
George Clinton!

01:51.760 --> 01:55.036
The king of interplanetary
funkmanship.

01:55.760 --> 02:00.754
George's psychedelic rock will leave
you feeling funky, obviously.

02:01.200 --> 02:05.113
And soulful, which is
the least I can do.

02:05.520 --> 02:11.197
Now, we played a lot of Purge games
tonight, and we have just one more.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.791
It's simple,
yet effective.

02:13.880 --> 02:16.440
It's called "Mommy's Choice."

02:17.720 --> 02:22.840
Mommy, which one of you will
survive this year's Purge?

02:28.840 --> 02:30.910
No! No!

02:32.080 --> 02:33.080
No!

02:51.240 --> 02:54.198
This is just one of a
dozen protests around our capital

02:54.280 --> 02:57.909
after reports emerged claiming
that the New Founding Fathers

02:58.000 --> 03:01.834
had been using the Purge to
help their own economic agenda.

03:01.920 --> 03:05.959
Here's a recent statement by incendiary
Purge detractor Dante Bishop.

03:06.080 --> 03:09.675
For the past 20 years,
the NFFA has taken to legalized murder

03:09.760 --> 03:11.990
to decrease
the poor population,

03:12.080 --> 03:14.674
which in turn keeps the
government's spending down.

03:14.760 --> 03:18.355
Less welfare,
less healthcare, less housing.

03:18.760 --> 03:21.911
Recent polling suggests
that the growing anti-Purge sentiment

03:22.000 --> 03:25.879
may have a monumental effect on the
upcoming presidential election.

03:25.960 --> 03:29.509
Establishment NFFA candidate
Minister Edwidge Owens

03:29.600 --> 03:34.594
has been losing ground to wildcard
Independent candidate Senator Charlie Roan.

03:34.960 --> 03:39.670
Eighteen years ago, Roan was forced
to watch the brutal execution

03:39.760 --> 03:41.910
of her entire family
on Purge Night

03:42.000 --> 03:45.913
and entered the political arena
soon after with one goal in mind.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.434
To put an end to
the annual holiday.

03:48.520 --> 03:53.719
I have no doubt that the soul
of our country is at stake.

03:54.480 --> 03:57.074
The Purge has
to come to an end.

03:57.160 --> 04:01.870
Senator Roan is proving to
be the greatest threat to the NFFA regime

04:01.960 --> 04:04.838
since they first took
office 25 years ago...

04:20.959 --> 04:23.679
Is the cunt that close?

04:24.520 --> 04:26.511
All polls have her
a point behind.

04:27.760 --> 04:28.954
I'm sorry, Caleb,
I've done...

04:29.080 --> 04:31.878
No sorrys, Minister,
you're doing a great job.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.675
Let us put you
where you need to be.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.513
Thomas.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.915
We have our people out there countering
all this anti-NFFA bullshit.

04:43.720 --> 04:44.835
What else
can we do?

04:44.920 --> 04:48.515
We do
whatever it fucking takes!

04:52.920 --> 04:57.914
I have had it with all
these idealistic pigs.

04:59.360 --> 05:03.751
They want the impossible.
Everyone to have.

05:04.520 --> 05:06.909
Some cannot have.

05:07.160 --> 05:09.720
Not enough
to go around.

05:17.320 --> 05:21.313
It's time to do something
about all these cocksuckers,

05:21.520 --> 05:24.273
like that rat Bishop
and the cunt Senator

05:24.880 --> 05:29.032
trying to dismantle
everything we've built.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.358
We are going to use
this year's Purge

05:33.440 --> 05:36.750
to do some spring cleaning,
gentlemen.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.376
And where will you
be spending Purge Night, Minister?

05:51.400 --> 05:55.439
I will once again be presiding over
my party's Midnight Purge Mass

05:55.520 --> 05:56.794
because I still
believe in it.

05:56.880 --> 05:59.678
The Midnight
Purge Mass,

05:59.760 --> 06:04.197
where our great NFFA leaders gather
together and slaughter innocents.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.429
Is murder our
new religion?

06:05.520 --> 06:06.560
Senator.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.916
Murder is our new religion.
That's snappy.

06:09.280 --> 06:13.353
No, the Midnight Purge Mass where
NFFA leaders gather to celebrate

06:13.440 --> 06:16.716
the night that saved this
country from economic ruin.

06:16.800 --> 06:17.800
We have other ways.

06:17.880 --> 06:20.952
Now, America is
built upon sacrifice.

06:21.320 --> 06:24.392
From the Revolution
all the way to World War II.

06:24.640 --> 06:27.837
Our Lord God sacrificed
his only Son...

06:28.040 --> 06:29.632
Everybody look alive.

06:31.080 --> 06:32.456
Copy. We have
eyes on her, boss.

06:32.480 --> 06:34.789
That's why
we must sacrifice every year

06:34.880 --> 06:38.031
in order to rid
ourselves of hatred.

06:38.120 --> 06:41.157
Remember what I said.
She moves, we move.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.838
Now, the stats are undeniable.
There has been far less crime...

06:47.920 --> 06:49.976
This is crap.
Do I have to listen to this?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.056
Send me to the
Principal's office.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.399
I can't listen
to this anymore.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.256
Okay, we'll send you to
the Principal's office

06:54.280 --> 06:55.760
'cause you can't
keep your mouth shut.

06:55.840 --> 06:58.400
More low-income
people are killed

06:58.520 --> 07:00.715
during the Purge
than anyone else.

07:00.840 --> 07:02.990
The money
generated from the Purge

07:03.080 --> 07:06.117
lines the pockets of the NRA
and insurance companies.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.428
Don't listen to her!

07:07.520 --> 07:09.750
Any government system
that relies on violence

07:09.840 --> 07:11.114
to answer
its problems

07:11.240 --> 07:12.275
must be rebooted.

07:12.360 --> 07:13.793
She's doing good,
Leo.

07:15.320 --> 07:20.314
It is time to call upon the
better angels of our nature.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.236
He is going
to keep lying.

07:26.360 --> 07:28.794
Jesus Christ.
There she goes again.

07:28.880 --> 07:30.871
Secure the audience.
I'm on it.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.456
I'd like to talk to you guys.

07:33.480 --> 07:37.029
Put a leash on her, Chief.
She's no good to anyone dead.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.189
You got it, Leo.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.909
- Okay. We're on the move.
- Copy, boss.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.519
Thank you very much. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.114
Go sit down. I'm happy to stay
here for the rest of the night.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.031
Stay close to her.
Keep it tight.

07:51.440 --> 07:54.034
Go out. Purge and purify.
Purge and purify!

07:54.840 --> 07:56.671
Hi. Thank you again.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.111
As she's
done many times before,

08:03.200 --> 08:05.475
Senator Roan broke
security protocol,

08:05.560 --> 08:07.456
walking off the stage,
stepping into the audience.

08:07.480 --> 08:09.835
Tell you this much,
she got 'em little titties,

08:09.920 --> 08:12.275
but she got some
big-ass balls.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.471
She ain't got
a snowball's chance

08:14.560 --> 08:16.118
in a steam bath of
winning this thing,

08:16.200 --> 08:17.952
but she be taking on
them ol' white-haired

08:18.040 --> 08:19.678
George Washington
wannabe mofos

08:19.760 --> 08:20.760
all by herself.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.831
And to that,
I say bully for her.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.195
Oh, horseshit.
She's full of it too.

08:25.280 --> 08:26.872
Nothing'll ever change.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.234
Hey, Laney.
Laney, Laney?

08:28.360 --> 08:31.272
I think we've offended Marcos
with our anti-Senator talk.

08:32.840 --> 08:34.477
The Senator's
going to win.

08:34.559 --> 08:37.313
She's gonna make real changes too.
You'll see.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.913
All she needs
is Florida.

08:39.360 --> 08:43.751
She gets the 29 electoral votes from
Florida, that puts her over 270.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.711
- She can do it.
- Smartass.

08:47.280 --> 08:50.272
All that useless shit and can't
butter a damn bagel correctly.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.112
I could butter your bagel, boss.

08:53.240 --> 08:54.696
- Oh, you'd butter my bagel?
- Mmm...

08:54.720 --> 08:56.711
Well, you got jokes
over there.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.776
Yeah, you just be careful,
kid, with all that hope,

08:58.800 --> 09:00.153
'cause it can be
a bad thing.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.549
Hope can lead
to a lot of letdown.

09:02.640 --> 09:03.789
Tell him, Irish I.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.038
Excuse me, what?

09:06.520 --> 09:08.033
I'm not
paying attention.

09:08.440 --> 09:10.874
I'm thinking about
waffles and pussy.

09:10.960 --> 09:12.951
That's all I ever really
think about, actually.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.760
Mmm-mmm...
- Irish I, ladies and gentlemen.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.798
The fuck you laughing at?
I'm dead serious.

09:18.880 --> 09:19.880
Ah, fuck!

09:26.640 --> 09:29.757
The New Founding Fathers
believe in fairness.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.400
And we hear what
the people are saying.

09:31.880 --> 09:35.031
That the Purge benefits
the rich and the powerful.

09:35.120 --> 09:36.519
That was never the intention.

09:37.080 --> 09:40.675
From this point on,
no one is exempt.

09:41.320 --> 09:44.312
The rules protecting level 10
government officials have been revoked.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.512
Yeah. Come in.

09:46.600 --> 09:47.749
You seeing this?

09:47.840 --> 09:49.671
Yeah, NFFA is revoking
the Purge rule

09:49.760 --> 09:50.816
that protects
government officials

09:50.840 --> 09:52.671
of ranking 10
on Purge Night.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.593
Yeah, I'll secure a safe house and
full security detail on the night.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.875
No. I'm staying home
on Purge Night.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.871
Senator, I don't think
that's a good idea.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.678
If the voters get wind
that I'm hiding

10:01.760 --> 10:03.751
in a fortress like
some rich asshole,

10:03.840 --> 10:05.671
I lose votes
and the NFFA wins.

10:05.760 --> 10:08.797
I stay home like
99% of the population.

10:09.480 --> 10:12.199
Make it safe.
Whatever it takes.

10:14.880 --> 10:15.995
Right.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.709
Half price
on all masks.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.391
Come on inside.

10:37.280 --> 10:40.272
The Purge is
Halloween for adults!

10:43.560 --> 10:47.633
Hordes of young adults are arriving
from Spain, Denmark, South Africa.

10:47.720 --> 10:49.517
They're being called
Murder Tourists

10:49.600 --> 10:51.318
as they are here
for one reason.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.515
To Purge.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.676
We're here to
experience the Purge.

10:54.760 --> 10:57.479
To kill. Release all
the anger and hate.

10:57.560 --> 11:00.393
To be like Americans.
We're very excited.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.993
Foreigners coming
to our capital to kill.

11:07.080 --> 11:10.277
Murder tourism. It's the new booming
business in our country this year.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.312
Murder tourism.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.670
What's happened
to our country, Joe?

11:15.320 --> 11:17.834
Mrs. Sabian,
I wish I knew.

11:17.920 --> 11:20.115
But you take care
of yourself, Mrs. S.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.976
Next time you need something,
just give us a call.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.719
I'll have Marcos run it over
and save you the trip, okay?

11:24.960 --> 11:27.269
I come by
to flirt with you, Joe!

11:27.680 --> 11:28.680
What?

11:28.920 --> 11:31.275
No one's
gonna take that from me.

11:31.400 --> 11:34.296
Ah, you better get out of here. Get
on out of here.

11:34.320 --> 11:35.320
Yeah!

11:35.400 --> 11:36.799
Oh. Get out of here.

11:37.600 --> 11:38.874
Now she nasty.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.951
She... That's a nasty
woman, right there.

11:51.960 --> 11:53.791
Joe. Mira.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.472
Son of a bitch!

12:05.480 --> 12:08.916
Where's he going?
I never saw him move so damn fast.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.480
All right, girls, give it up.
I won't have to call the police.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.316
Get outta my face,
old man!

12:15.480 --> 12:19.234
Let's not do this the hard way, okay?
I'm giving you an out.

12:19.320 --> 12:22.232
All right, give up the candy or
I'll have to take it away from you.

12:24.320 --> 12:28.836
You touch me and I scream "rape,"
you cocksucking pig.

12:29.680 --> 12:30.795
Now walk away.

12:30.880 --> 12:31.880
Give it back.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.912
Who are you, bitch?
Better get out of my way!

12:37.000 --> 12:38.040
That's Laney Rucker,
Kimmy.

12:41.640 --> 12:42.834
Laney Rucker?

12:44.600 --> 12:45.828
Holy shit.

12:47.240 --> 12:48.832
OG Queen badass?

12:49.680 --> 12:52.831
Yo! They called
you Pequeña Muerte.

12:53.400 --> 12:54.515
Little Death.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.715
Yo, you're my
motherfucking hero.

12:59.080 --> 13:00.877
That makes me proud.

13:01.840 --> 13:03.876
Now give back
whatever you stole.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.991
And apologize.

13:08.680 --> 13:09.874
Oh, my God.

13:13.320 --> 13:16.710
Sorry, mister.
I was just playin'.

13:19.680 --> 13:23.673
So, Ms. Rucker,
what happened to you?

13:24.720 --> 13:27.518
You look all
whitish now.

13:30.480 --> 13:34.473
Later, Ms. Rucker.
Wish I met you back in the day.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.399
Excuse me.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.160
Well...

13:49.920 --> 13:53.435
You were a lot more respectful back
when you were shoplifting here.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.456
You know, I distinctly
remember one time,

13:55.480 --> 13:56.515
you called me "sir."

13:56.600 --> 13:57.919
Oh, bullshit.

13:58.200 --> 14:01.112
But listen, I just want
to say thank you.

14:01.960 --> 14:04.030
You're my family, Joe.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.998
I appreciate that.
Thank you, Laney.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.235
I want men in there.

14:17.320 --> 14:20.039
I want men in there.
I want a lot of men back there.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.918
She's got some security,
but I'm revamping the entire thing.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.558
We got new barricades
on all the doors,

14:24.640 --> 14:26.358
all the windows
back and front.

14:26.440 --> 14:27.555
Looks safe.

14:27.640 --> 14:29.256
Chief, if you tell me
it's safe one more time,

14:29.280 --> 14:30.759
I'm gonna throw you
down the steps.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.398
Please don't do that.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.514
Men here. Men here.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.716
We got a security monitor
system in this room.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.916
We got eyes and
ears on everything.

14:41.760 --> 14:44.194
This is her safe room.
She is not to leave her safe room.

14:44.320 --> 14:47.278
No one is to go inside her safe room.
Do we understand each other?

14:47.720 --> 14:49.616
This is a mess. She's not
gonna be happy about it.

14:49.640 --> 14:50.976
I don't care if
she's happy, Chief.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.356
And I want to go on record as
saying this is a bad idea.

14:54.440 --> 14:55.509
No matter what
we do here,

14:55.600 --> 14:58.433
this house and this Senator
are at risk on Purge Night.

14:58.520 --> 15:00.317
You understand me?
Duly noted.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.433
Let's lock it down.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.433
"Let's lock it down."

15:06.840 --> 15:08.114
It's just me
and you, pal.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.997
Tell me what you want
me to do. I'm there.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.896
Go downstairs, make sure
they take care of the doors.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.751
Keep an eye on that guy. Done.

15:18.920 --> 15:21.798
The NFFA has
created predatory capitalism

15:21.880 --> 15:25.077
where profit-making
is the essence of democracy.

15:26.480 --> 15:28.675
We've come to D.C.
to make some changes.

15:29.840 --> 15:33.150
That was Dante Bishop.
Like his predecessor Carmelo Johns...

15:33.360 --> 15:34.360
Joe's Deli.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.536
...Dante is suspected
of eliminating

15:35.560 --> 15:36.656
wealthy NFFA supporters
on Purge Nights.

15:36.680 --> 15:37.680
Excuse me?

15:38.840 --> 15:42.310
And many are wondering why he has
come to Washington this year.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.760
Wait, wait. Hold it.
Wait a minute.

15:43.880 --> 15:45.996
Why are you raising
my rates now? Today?

15:46.080 --> 15:47.672
Do you know
what today is?

15:47.880 --> 15:50.872
Yeah, but look, I...
Yeah... I can't afford that.

15:51.240 --> 15:52.832
What do you mean,
you're sorry?

15:52.920 --> 15:55.912
Yeah, I'm talking to you.
Let me speak to your... Your super...

15:56.720 --> 15:59.154
Son of a... Son of a bitch!

15:59.240 --> 16:00.309
Joe?

16:02.040 --> 16:03.109
What the hell's
going on?

16:03.200 --> 16:04.838
The damn
insurance company.

16:05.040 --> 16:08.510
They just raised the premium on
my Purge coverage. By thousands.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.670
The day before
the damn Purge.

16:10.760 --> 16:13.797
If I don't pay it by tomorrow,
I have no Purge coverage for this store.

16:13.880 --> 16:14.880
They can't do that.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.399
Yeah, well,
they just did it.

16:17.200 --> 16:18.474
Just lock the
place down, Joe.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.152
Yeah, but that's
not enough.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.515
If I have no insurance,
I am screwed.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.709
I'll just have to protect
this place myself.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.736
- Are you crazy?
- That's not a good idea, boss.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.120
Look, we love
this place, too, Joe.

16:32.160 --> 16:33.680
I've been coming here
since I was born.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.228
But it's just stuff.
It can be replaced.

16:36.440 --> 16:37.634
You can't be.

16:37.720 --> 16:39.995
Yeah, but what about what you
do on Purge Night, Laney?

16:40.080 --> 16:41.080
Huh?

16:41.760 --> 16:44.593
Is that not the pot calling
the kettle brown? No?

16:44.920 --> 16:46.990
That's different, Joe,
and you know that.

16:47.080 --> 16:49.435
I'm protected,
and you won't be.

16:52.760 --> 16:57.231
This is all I got, guys.
This is my slice of the pie.

16:59.760 --> 17:02.228
Man, I cannot,
I can't lose this place.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.038
I can't lose this place.

17:08.280 --> 17:10.669
Hold on, Joe.
Let's talk about this.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.072
Everything is in place.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.119
Team's in position.

17:44.440 --> 17:46.431
Ten minutes
to lockdown, boss.

18:32.480 --> 18:33.879
Hey, Mama.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.319
You ready?

18:37.400 --> 18:38.628
Yeah.

18:39.080 --> 18:40.399
Vaya con Dios.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.192
Okay, let's go.

18:49.320 --> 18:52.869
Okay. This is gonna be home
for the next 12 hours.

18:52.960 --> 18:55.315
You need anything,
you contact me and me only.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.879
Clear?
Clear.

18:57.240 --> 18:58.389
Let's begin.

19:24.440 --> 19:26.351
This is not a test.

19:26.440 --> 19:29.034
This is your Emergency
Broadcast System

19:29.120 --> 19:31.680
announcing the commencement
of the annual Purge

19:31.760 --> 19:33.751
sanctioned by the
U. S. government.

19:34.240 --> 19:38.358
Commencing at the siren,
any and all crime, including murder,

19:38.440 --> 19:41.000
will be legal for
12 continuous hours.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.399
Here we go.

19:43.080 --> 19:46.231
Police, fire and
emergency medical services

19:46.320 --> 19:50.154
will be unavailable until
tomorrow morning at 7 a. m.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.279
And, for the first time
since its inception,

19:53.360 --> 19:57.273
no one has been granted special
immunity from the Purge.

19:57.440 --> 20:00.113
No citizen or group
will be exempt.

20:00.320 --> 20:05.633
Blessed be our New Founding Fathers,
and America, a nation reborn.

20:06.120 --> 20:07.792
May God be with you all.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.831
I see you, Bobby.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.976
You know you
can relax now, right?

20:45.000 --> 20:47.070
No, I'll relax
in the morning.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.152
Am I interrupting?

20:52.120 --> 20:53.678
Senator, you should
be in the den.

20:55.640 --> 20:57.136
Eric, thank you for
being here tonight.

20:57.160 --> 20:58.195
My pleasure.

20:58.280 --> 20:59.759
Leo, have a drink
with me.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.038
You don't have a choice.

21:06.680 --> 21:07.999
Sounds serious.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.758
Don't say a word.

21:09.840 --> 21:11.239
Or I'll stick my
foot up your ass.

21:21.040 --> 21:22.109
Sit.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.313
It's water, Leo.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.479
Are you scared?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.399
I'm terrified.

21:46.560 --> 21:49.154
What made you apply
for this position?

21:50.120 --> 21:51.792
I like your politics.

21:51.880 --> 21:54.872
No. No bullshit.
I want a real answer.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.229
I lost my son
some years ago.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.239
He was killed.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.896
I almost did something on Purge Night
that would've destroyed a lot of lives.

22:10.920 --> 22:12.399
I want this night gone.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.752
I know you do, too.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.471
Especially after
what you lost.

22:19.560 --> 22:22.552
Yeah. Despite
all of that,

22:23.600 --> 22:25.795
you have a big problem
with how I do things.

22:26.600 --> 22:28.352
You take risks, Senator.

22:28.440 --> 22:31.796
My job is to eliminate
risks and keep you alive.

22:32.440 --> 22:33.919
You don't
make that easy.

22:35.240 --> 22:37.834
The soul of this country
is at stake, Leo.

22:37.960 --> 22:42.954
The only way that I can win is to risk
everything, and that includes my life.

22:56.280 --> 22:58.271
Peace, not Purge!

23:01.480 --> 23:02.799
You go, girls!

23:02.880 --> 23:04.711
Have a drink on us!

23:04.800 --> 23:06.552
Can't you see
we're working?

23:08.960 --> 23:11.838
Purge, motherfuckers!

23:13.480 --> 23:16.677
Just gonna wait right here
and see what happens.

23:17.320 --> 23:18.673
Purge!

23:20.600 --> 23:22.158
They probably won't
bother us, okay?

23:25.080 --> 23:28.470
Purge.
Purge. Purge.

23:30.280 --> 23:32.475
Go, go, go! Let's move!

23:59.680 --> 24:02.148
Help! Help! Please!

24:05.360 --> 24:08.511
Somebody help! Help! Help!

24:09.800 --> 24:11.358
Please! Please!

24:24.680 --> 24:27.114
Stop! Stop!
Please, stop!

24:27.200 --> 24:28.553
Please, help him!

24:29.080 --> 24:32.277
Something's going down. Hey, looks
like someone needs our services.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.436
Let's go.
Let's do this. Stop.

24:35.240 --> 24:38.152
I shot my husband!
I shot him. Oh, God!

24:38.240 --> 24:40.310
Okay. Calm down.
Tell me what happened.

24:41.520 --> 24:44.796
Oh, no! It was
a mistake! I'm sorry!

25:03.480 --> 25:05.755
Hey, boss!
It's me! It's me.

25:05.960 --> 25:07.279
Come on
outta there, boy.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.037
Good Lord, son.

25:12.400 --> 25:15.437
It's Purge Night. You don't
sneak up on black people.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.872
Good night,
blue cheese.

25:19.120 --> 25:22.237
Where the hell you going?
And why you carrying a chair?

25:22.440 --> 25:23.919
I like sitting.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.111
Yeah, well, you ain't
gonna be staying.

25:26.800 --> 25:30.076
Look, you know I appreciate you coming
out here to watch my back, but I'm good.

25:30.160 --> 25:31.354
I got this.
No.

25:31.880 --> 25:34.872
I'll stay.
Nothing else to do.

25:34.960 --> 25:37.030
Look, please don't
be a pain in the ass.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.792
I want you to go
home and be safe.

25:38.960 --> 25:42.635
I don't want you out here on
Purge Night, son. I got this!

26:26.320 --> 26:31.872
Purge Night, bitch! It's Purge
Night, bitch! It's Purge Night, bitch!

26:34.840 --> 26:36.831
Give me that shit. Let's go!

26:39.360 --> 26:41.351
Fuck you!

27:14.560 --> 27:15.560
Ooh!

27:17.560 --> 27:20.028
Happy Purge,
you old fuck!

27:21.720 --> 27:23.950
You better find
someplace else to go!

27:24.240 --> 27:27.630
I got a wicked
sweet tooth tonight.

27:27.720 --> 27:29.551
And I want my candy bar.

27:30.360 --> 27:31.554
And I'm gonna take it.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.590
You don't got the balls
to stop me.

27:36.920 --> 27:37.920
Fuck!

27:39.120 --> 27:40.314
I have the balls.

27:40.760 --> 27:41.909
Now go.

27:46.560 --> 27:49.313
I already took care
of my mom and dad tonight.

27:49.400 --> 27:50.753
You're next.

27:51.120 --> 27:53.680
I want my candy bar,
cocksucker.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.440
Come on!

28:18.600 --> 28:20.192
So, what's up with that?

28:21.280 --> 28:24.113
Every day in Juárez
was like the Purge.

28:24.320 --> 28:26.117
I know how
to shoot, boss.

28:29.600 --> 28:32.239
Son, I really wish
you'd stayed home.

28:52.520 --> 28:54.397
I don't know.
It's that time.

29:21.280 --> 29:22.280
Eric.

29:31.320 --> 29:33.576
What are you still doing up here?
You're on first floor duty.

29:33.600 --> 29:34.794
How was your chat?

29:35.720 --> 29:37.870
Enlightening. Go.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.873
Chief, find a bedroom.
I got it from here.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.433
All right, Leo.

30:33.120 --> 30:35.429
Boys. Why don't
you take a break?

30:35.680 --> 30:38.558
Go watch some TV, huh?
It's gonna be a long night.

30:38.640 --> 30:39.640
Yes, sir.

31:16.160 --> 31:18.151
I'm coming
outside, boys.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.677
How ya doing
out there, Bobby?

32:05.440 --> 32:07.032
Sniper One,
radio check.

32:11.320 --> 32:13.550
Bobby, radio check.

32:15.240 --> 32:16.593
Sniper Two,
radio check.

32:16.680 --> 32:18.033
Sniper Two.

32:43.840 --> 32:45.478
Someone is coming for you.

32:45.960 --> 32:47.439
What?
Put that on.

32:47.560 --> 32:49.630
Leo, the house is surrounded...
Move, move!

32:49.720 --> 32:50.760
I'm moving.
What are you...

32:51.520 --> 32:53.954
You said you had men on the roof.
You have snipers.

32:54.080 --> 32:55.816
Not anymore. Not anymore.
What do you mean, not anymore?

32:55.840 --> 32:56.989
Someone betrayed us.
What?

32:57.120 --> 32:59.156
I can't trust anyone.
Put on that vest.

33:03.960 --> 33:05.632
Listen to me!
This isn't a drill.

33:05.720 --> 33:08.109
Someone's coming to kill you.
You understand me?

33:08.200 --> 33:09.315
Move.

33:09.400 --> 33:10.719
Moving.

33:11.800 --> 33:12.800
What the...
Go!

33:12.880 --> 33:13.936
Okay, what
the hell is that?

33:13.960 --> 33:15.188
That's my little
secret. Move.

33:15.280 --> 33:17.555
One, two, three!

33:18.680 --> 33:19.680
Okay.

33:34.920 --> 33:36.831
Boss! It's just me!

33:39.560 --> 33:40.560
Fuck.

33:43.040 --> 33:45.110
Where the hell is she?
Jesus Christ.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.438
What the fuck is this?

34:31.760 --> 34:33.830
I don't know what
the fuck that is.

34:46.719 --> 34:49.280
Our mark may be
outside. Repeat.

34:49.360 --> 34:51.554
Your mark may be outside.

34:51.760 --> 34:53.351
Check your perimeters.

35:03.440 --> 35:05.431
No payment
unless we find her.

35:09.520 --> 35:10.520
Fuck.

35:10.560 --> 35:11.675
I see her!

35:39.640 --> 35:40.640
Down!

35:49.960 --> 35:50.960
Come here.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.397
Move. Go! Go!
Go! Go!

36:11.480 --> 36:12.708
Hey, Joe,
you up there?

36:12.800 --> 36:13.869
Is that Laney?

36:16.440 --> 36:17.589
Marcos!

36:18.640 --> 36:20.756
My guys!
How you all doing tonight?

36:21.320 --> 36:22.833
We're good. You?

36:22.920 --> 36:23.920
Ah...

36:24.000 --> 36:26.275
I just dropped
someone off at triage.

36:26.720 --> 36:31.236
His wife shot him because she couldn't
stand looking at his face anymore.

36:31.880 --> 36:36.590
She said Purging didn't make her feel
any better like they said it would.

36:37.120 --> 36:38.838
Just stay safe,
Lane.

36:39.320 --> 36:43.313
Anything happens, do not
hesitate to call us.

36:43.800 --> 36:45.791
Yeah, same goes for you.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.479
Okay?
All right.

36:47.720 --> 36:48.914
All right.

36:58.840 --> 37:01.354
God, I hate that she's
out there like that.

37:03.320 --> 37:05.788
Help me! Help me!

37:08.240 --> 37:09.912
Stop. Stop!

37:15.200 --> 37:17.509
What was that?
Some kind of homegrown militia?

37:17.600 --> 37:20.160
Those were skilled mercs with
a lot of money behind them.

37:20.240 --> 37:21.720
Enough to get to
someone on our staff.

37:21.880 --> 37:23.080
I'm guessing
it's the Minister.

37:23.160 --> 37:25.435
The Minister, the NFFA,
the whole fucking lot of them.

37:25.520 --> 37:26.999
I'm getting
too close.

37:37.080 --> 37:39.275
It's a lot of blood, Leo.
We should call someone.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.434
I don't know who to trust. We are
on our own. You understand me?

37:43.280 --> 37:46.113
Okay. Where do we go?

37:46.240 --> 37:49.391
East. Out of the city.
There are a lot of threats.

37:50.680 --> 37:52.033
There's a lot
of death.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.956
Purge
Sanitation Services.

38:08.640 --> 38:10.232
Death collection haul.

38:10.960 --> 38:13.952
Purge victim
removal and disposal.

38:14.160 --> 38:15.752
Keep Washington clean.

38:15.960 --> 38:16.960
It's okay.

38:19.240 --> 38:20.673
Death collection haul.

38:21.920 --> 38:23.911
This is how
it's gonna go now.

38:24.600 --> 38:28.309
Like you said, fate of
the country's at stake.

38:28.520 --> 38:31.637
Okay? It's my show now.

38:31.720 --> 38:33.392
Look, I'm not
an idiot.

38:33.720 --> 38:36.154
I know what you're capable of.
I'm the one who hired you.

38:36.240 --> 38:38.536
But if I see something I don't like,
I'm not gonna be quiet about it.

38:38.560 --> 38:39.675
It's not in my nature.

38:39.760 --> 38:43.389
Senator, I need you to follow me.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.275
Come on.

39:07.360 --> 39:08.395
It's Tommy, sir.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.556
He's in bad shape.
He's unconscious.

39:11.280 --> 39:12.952
Everyone else
up there is dead.

39:13.040 --> 39:15.838
Get him to the ground unit.
Get him stabilized.

39:15.920 --> 39:18.957
Then start street surveillance.
I'll search from above.

39:20.120 --> 39:23.317
We need her alive, so let's
find her before the crazies do.

39:23.400 --> 39:24.400
Sir.

39:34.880 --> 39:36.279
They're tracking us.

39:37.040 --> 39:39.713
Where? I'm not seeing them.
How are they seeing us?

39:45.200 --> 39:46.474
Mercenaries?

39:46.680 --> 39:50.434
No. That's a homemade
drone. Purgers.

39:54.200 --> 39:55.200
Now what?

39:56.880 --> 39:59.314
Run. Fast.

40:25.760 --> 40:27.113
Come, come, come!

40:41.240 --> 40:45.153
It's behind you, Leo.
Thirty-five yards back, 15 yards up.

41:23.120 --> 41:24.120
Down!

41:52.440 --> 41:56.672
Reason I'm so hard on you, son,
like I am is

41:56.760 --> 41:59.274
someday I'd like to
make you a partner.

42:00.160 --> 42:04.676
Yep. Oh, boy. Coming here from
another country like you did.

42:05.560 --> 42:07.551
Having your own business.

42:08.080 --> 42:10.640
American dream
is still alive.

42:12.160 --> 42:15.596
Whoo-hoo!

42:48.240 --> 42:51.676
We love you, America. America is
the greatest country in the world.

42:51.760 --> 42:53.557
We are gonna kill you.

43:09.040 --> 43:10.917
We will now Purge.

43:11.120 --> 43:13.953
We will torture you and violate
your flesh.

43:14.160 --> 43:17.630
Remove your skin and
share in your blood.

43:18.240 --> 43:19.958
This is the American way.

43:35.520 --> 43:36.669
Senator.

43:41.800 --> 43:43.199
Come with us.

44:03.600 --> 44:05.636
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa...

44:17.320 --> 44:18.799
Stay.
Yeah.

44:19.400 --> 44:20.400
Yeah.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.752
Well, this is my place.

44:26.920 --> 44:28.400
You can stay all night
if you want to.

44:29.960 --> 44:33.794
Now, I got to ask you 'cause
I'm just a nosey old dog.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.993
What in the Mississippi fuck was you
doing outside on Purge Night, Senator?

44:39.680 --> 44:40.874
Yeah.

44:40.960 --> 44:44.794
There was an assassination
attempt on me.

44:46.200 --> 44:49.476
I can't thank you enough, Mr...
I'm sorry, I know you told me.

44:49.600 --> 44:51.909
Dixon. You can call me Joe, Senator.
Yeah.

44:52.280 --> 44:53.952
Joe, I'm Charlie.

44:54.040 --> 44:55.155
Charlie.
Yeah.

44:55.240 --> 44:56.639
That's Marcos
right there.

44:57.680 --> 45:00.399
Marcos is...
He's a fan of yours.

45:01.120 --> 45:02.758
Hi, Marcos.
Hey, Senator.

45:02.800 --> 45:04.950
He actually think you can
win this thing. Oh, yeah?

45:05.760 --> 45:09.548
Shit! Tell her what
she need to do to win, Marcos.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.039
No, it's not
my place to say.

45:11.120 --> 45:15.238
Well, you saved my life, Marcos.
I'd like to hear it, please.

45:16.960 --> 45:19.076
Florida is the key.

45:19.880 --> 45:21.791
You have to get
the elders.

45:22.320 --> 45:23.753
That's smart.

45:24.200 --> 45:26.031
He's not wrong, Joe.
What do you think?

45:26.400 --> 45:28.391
I don't think you
got a damn chance.

45:28.880 --> 45:30.518
Well, have
a little faith.

45:30.720 --> 45:33.996
Well, I lost my faith in the system
a long time ago, Senator. Water?

45:34.520 --> 45:35.520
Thank you.

45:35.600 --> 45:39.832
Place is moderately secure. Cameras.
Maybe we stay here.

45:40.560 --> 45:43.358
"Maybe we stay here"? Where you going?
You going back out there?

45:43.440 --> 45:47.274
Joe, do you have a first aid kit?
Leo, my security, was shot.

45:47.360 --> 45:49.316
I'm fine.
You're not fine.

45:49.400 --> 45:51.470
I'm fine.
You're not. Sit.

45:54.520 --> 45:56.317
You want me
to take it off?

46:01.080 --> 46:02.433
It's okay.
It's nothing.

46:02.520 --> 46:04.238
Yeah? Doesn't
look like nothing.

46:07.160 --> 46:08.256
Let me see.
Let me see.

46:08.280 --> 46:10.400
I know a little bit about first aid.
I could help you.

46:14.800 --> 46:15.835
The bullet's deep.

46:16.080 --> 46:17.149
You need stitches.
Yeah.

46:17.240 --> 46:18.275
But we can't
do that here.

46:18.360 --> 46:20.476
Right. Clean it up. Patch it up.
Come on. Move.

46:21.440 --> 46:22.440
Okay.

46:23.040 --> 46:24.040
Fast. Come on.

46:27.240 --> 46:29.037
What about you guys?
Who are you?

46:29.240 --> 46:31.276
Is this necessary?
It's very necessary.

46:31.360 --> 46:32.873
You, what's your name?
Where you from?

46:32.960 --> 46:34.518
Marcos Dali.
Mexico City.

46:34.600 --> 46:36.795
But I've been an American
citizen for two years.

46:36.880 --> 46:38.279
You got a record?

46:38.360 --> 46:39.713
Not here.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.991
What did you do
in Mexico?

46:43.440 --> 46:45.431
I tried to survive.

46:45.840 --> 46:47.956
What are you doing
out on Purge Night?

46:48.040 --> 46:49.473
Protecting the deli
against looters

46:49.560 --> 46:51.835
because my boss lost his
Purge insurance yesterday.

46:51.920 --> 46:54.434
Yeah, that's something
you can look into, Senator.

46:54.520 --> 46:56.636
Insurance companies
screwing the working man.

46:56.720 --> 46:58.153
Yeah?

46:58.240 --> 47:00.071
What's your
name, pal?

47:00.160 --> 47:01.536
You know what,
Mr. Secret Service Man?

47:01.560 --> 47:03.560
You should be thanking my
black ass for helping you

47:03.600 --> 47:05.113
instead of
interrogating me.

47:05.200 --> 47:06.600
His name is Joe Dixon.

47:06.640 --> 47:08.016
- Joe Dixon, have I offended you?
- Yeah.

47:08.040 --> 47:09.096
Yeah, man,
just a little bit.

47:09.120 --> 47:10.176
Your feelings are
not a concern of mine.

47:10.200 --> 47:11.713
Little respect.
That's all I need.

47:11.800 --> 47:13.597
Everyone shut up,
please!

47:14.200 --> 47:15.428
What?
Look.

47:31.520 --> 47:33.431
You stupid
motherfucker!

47:33.600 --> 47:35.830
You should have let
us take the candy bar!

47:36.200 --> 47:40.830
Now, you're gonna fuckin' pay for it,
you stupid son of a bitch!

47:41.440 --> 47:42.953
Whoo!

47:43.520 --> 47:46.557
It's a good night
to Purge, isn't it?

47:47.920 --> 47:48.920
Oh, hell!

47:48.960 --> 47:50.234
Who the hell
is that?

47:50.560 --> 47:51.896
The looters I was
telling you about.

47:51.920 --> 47:53.956
Purge Night, Senator.
What did you expect?

47:56.200 --> 48:00.193
Hey, you old fuck!
I'm back.

48:02.600 --> 48:04.272
And I brought
some friends.

48:04.800 --> 48:06.518
And I'm gonna
get that candy bar.

48:06.600 --> 48:08.296
They have chainsaws
and they're coming inside.

48:08.320 --> 48:09.736
All right. I got to
get you outta here.

48:09.760 --> 48:11.318
Yeah, but they're
at both entrances.

48:11.400 --> 48:14.551
Then I'm gonna Purge by killing you
and burning this bitch to the ground!

48:14.640 --> 48:16.312
I gotta call her.

48:16.520 --> 48:17.520
Who?

48:17.600 --> 48:19.716
We have a friend out
there in a triage van.

48:20.080 --> 48:21.638
You trust this friend?

48:21.720 --> 48:24.234
Hey, you still
questioning my integrity.

48:24.320 --> 48:26.709
Boy, you are
a piece of work, man.

48:28.880 --> 48:30.080
Come on,
girl, pick up.

48:30.360 --> 48:32.396
Those motherfuckers
blindsided us, man.

48:32.520 --> 48:33.976
I gotta get back out there.
No, no, no.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.753
You're not going anywhere.
I told your mom I'd look after you.

48:36.840 --> 48:39.416
Just hurry up. Hurry up and bandage
me up so I can get back out there.

48:39.440 --> 48:41.096
Okay, you promised me you
were gonna stay home tonight.

48:41.120 --> 48:42.439
Well, I want
to Purge tonight.

48:42.520 --> 48:43.748
No.
I want to Purge.

48:43.840 --> 48:45.512
Laney, what? Laney!

48:46.640 --> 48:47.736
For real, Laney?

48:47.760 --> 48:48.875
Yeah. For real.

48:48.960 --> 48:50.757
You heard me right.
Senator Roan.

48:50.840 --> 48:53.638
Call me back, Lane.
We need you bad.

48:55.280 --> 48:56.793
She'll call back.

48:56.880 --> 48:59.633
We can't count on your friend.
These kids will be in here soon.

49:01.520 --> 49:02.635
What do we do?

49:04.200 --> 49:05.200
Okay.

49:05.520 --> 49:07.988
We're gonna work as a team
to protect this woman.

49:08.080 --> 49:10.355
You gentlemen understand
what's at stake here, yes?

49:10.800 --> 49:12.631
Yes? All right.
Yes.

49:13.080 --> 49:16.277
We are gonna
Purge today

49:16.360 --> 49:18.430
Purge today, Purge today

49:19.320 --> 49:25.190
We are gonna Purge today
Burn this bitch down

49:27.560 --> 49:28.629
Fuck!

49:28.720 --> 49:30.950
Okay, you take the back,
I'm gonna take the front.

49:31.040 --> 49:32.189
I'll take the front
with you.

49:32.320 --> 49:33.920
No, you're not gonna
be on the frontline.

49:33.960 --> 49:36.155
Are you crazy, Leo?
Give me a gun.

49:36.240 --> 49:39.056
I will give you a gun, but you're not
on the frontline. Over my dead body.

49:39.080 --> 49:40.433
Then you better
drop dead.

49:40.840 --> 49:42.558
I think
he's right, Senator.

49:42.640 --> 49:43.789
Thank you, Deli Man.

49:43.880 --> 49:47.077
Deli Man? I agree with you,
you still throwing attitude?

49:47.160 --> 49:49.594
Okay, enough!
Executive decision.

49:49.680 --> 49:52.069
I'm with Leo. We need as
many guns as we can get.

49:58.720 --> 49:59.720
Go, go, go!

50:00.080 --> 50:01.115
Move, move, move!

50:04.560 --> 50:05.560
Down.

50:07.080 --> 50:10.117
Just point and shoot.
Do not shoot me.

50:19.600 --> 50:22.831
If I want some candy,
I'll take some candy!

50:22.920 --> 50:25.309
I'll take whatever
the fuck I want!

50:25.800 --> 50:27.995
My mom's not
gonna like this!

50:28.240 --> 50:31.710
This is what the Purge is all about.
Me getting mine.

50:31.840 --> 50:34.434
You getting yours and
nobody stopping anybody!

50:34.880 --> 50:36.552
Bye-bye, motherfucker!

50:36.640 --> 50:40.110
Say goodnight, cocksucker.
Because here comes your candy girl!

50:46.120 --> 50:47.519
Here they come.

50:57.680 --> 50:59.400
Fucking asshole!

51:12.280 --> 51:13.315
Hold on!

51:32.160 --> 51:33.275
Wait here.

52:08.520 --> 52:11.239
Pequeña Muerte
is back, bitches.

52:15.960 --> 52:18.394
Hey, guys!
I got your message.

52:18.480 --> 52:19.480
Laney!

52:21.440 --> 52:23.715
This is our girl.
Go, go, go!

52:28.960 --> 52:30.837
Holy shit,
it really is you.

52:30.960 --> 52:31.995
Where do we go?
The van.

52:32.520 --> 52:33.520
Go.

52:34.400 --> 52:35.400
Come on, Joe.

52:35.440 --> 52:37.431
I'll be with you in a minute.
I'll be there.

52:42.960 --> 52:44.075
Joe, come on.

52:44.160 --> 52:46.390
You get out of here,
kid. I'm staying.

52:46.800 --> 52:47.800
They'll kill you.

52:47.880 --> 52:49.029
Go now!

52:51.600 --> 52:52.794
If you stay, I stay.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.228
Just leave.

52:54.600 --> 52:55.828
Joe, listen to me.

52:55.920 --> 52:58.136
For some reason, the Senator
ended up in our neighborhood,

52:58.160 --> 52:59.513
in your deli.

52:59.600 --> 53:01.955
Maybe it's our duty
to help protect her.

53:02.480 --> 53:06.109
We'll rebuild the deli.
Whatever it takes, you and me. I promise.

53:06.200 --> 53:08.077
Come on, guys. Now!

53:19.200 --> 53:21.156
Where we headed?

53:21.320 --> 53:23.595
Underground triage center
service in the community.

53:23.720 --> 53:25.312
It's completely secure.

53:42.160 --> 53:45.789
Expand our perimeter. They're on foot.
They can't be far.

53:46.360 --> 53:48.237
Earl, spoke
with the ground unit.

53:48.640 --> 53:50.517
Tommy regained
consciousness.

53:50.600 --> 53:53.034
Says he got a shot off
at the Senator's security.

53:53.120 --> 53:55.350
He thinks the bullet
is lodged in his shoulder.

54:19.880 --> 54:21.871
How the hell did
it get to this?

54:32.080 --> 54:33.080
Who is he?

54:33.720 --> 54:35.119
Why is he cuffed?

54:35.200 --> 54:39.591
Rondo. Two bullet holes delivered by
a rival gang, but he's a good kid.

54:40.200 --> 54:42.555
He's chained up because I didn't
want him Purging anymore.

54:45.240 --> 54:47.435
So, Senator...

54:47.520 --> 54:49.795
NFFA made a move
on your ass.

54:50.200 --> 54:51.838
Seems that way.

54:52.680 --> 54:57.674
Goddamn conniving, duplicitous,
crooked, cocksucking politicians.

54:58.240 --> 54:59.389
Agreed.

55:00.920 --> 55:02.433
We're not
all that bad.

55:04.640 --> 55:05.755
My experience, Senator?

55:05.840 --> 55:08.957
My people are on our own, no matter
what you all say or promise.

55:09.040 --> 55:12.237
I'm kinda confused here.
Who the hell is this lady?

55:14.080 --> 55:15.080
You big dope!

55:15.120 --> 55:17.429
You give people from the
neighborhood a bad name.

55:24.160 --> 55:25.878
Just some Purgers.

55:27.200 --> 55:28.792
That's crossfire.

55:29.560 --> 55:31.073
Not for us.

55:35.320 --> 55:37.231
You seem really close.

55:37.800 --> 55:39.199
How do you know
each other?

55:39.280 --> 55:42.272
Joe gave me a job seven years ago
when I first came here from Mexico.

55:43.880 --> 55:45.757
I've been working
for him ever since.

55:46.080 --> 55:47.274
And you?

55:48.040 --> 55:50.110
Joe's been looking out
for me since I was a kid.

55:50.440 --> 55:52.351
And he helped me
get out of the life.

55:53.760 --> 55:55.955
Sounds like Joe
is a saint.

55:56.200 --> 55:58.111
Yeah, well,
I ain't no saint.

55:58.440 --> 56:00.112
I'm just doing my part.

56:02.640 --> 56:06.394
Riding around in a van,
on Purge Night, helping people?

56:07.680 --> 56:09.352
It's pretty dangerous.

56:09.560 --> 56:12.472
Unwritten Purge rule is leave
the triage units alone.

56:12.960 --> 56:15.394
It's true,
for the most part.

56:16.600 --> 56:19.672
Seriously, Laney, who the
hell are these people?

56:20.120 --> 56:21.720
Do you read?

56:23.400 --> 56:24.594
Down! Everybody down!

56:29.400 --> 56:31.416
- Anybody hit?
- I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

56:31.440 --> 56:32.440
You sure?
Yes.

56:32.480 --> 56:34.152
Laney!
I'm okay.

56:34.840 --> 56:36.671
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Rondo is dead.

56:39.520 --> 56:40.800
What the fuck was that?

56:40.880 --> 56:42.920
They found us, Senator.

56:45.400 --> 56:48.198
I want you to turn left!
Go under the freeway.

56:48.280 --> 56:49.793
Move! Move!
Yes.

56:50.640 --> 56:51.755
Tonight,

56:52.200 --> 56:55.795
the gates of hell will
open and invite me in.

56:56.840 --> 57:00.037
It's survival of
the fucking fittest.

57:00.320 --> 57:02.117
Who's the fittest?

57:02.320 --> 57:04.754
I'm the fittest of them all!

57:10.920 --> 57:13.992
What the fuck? We're gonna
lose them under there.

57:15.920 --> 57:18.275
Ground unit,
get your asses moving

57:18.360 --> 57:20.476
and get here now.
We got them cornered.

57:48.640 --> 57:50.039
Turn here and stop.

58:02.480 --> 58:03.480
Do we just
wait here?

58:03.560 --> 58:06.757
No, they'll have units on the ground.
They're gonna be all over us.

58:07.040 --> 58:09.376
We all better figure it out fast
'cause I don't like it here.

58:09.400 --> 58:10.960
It doesn't make any sense.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.216
There was no way they could've
known we'd be in this van.

58:13.240 --> 58:15.549
Doesn't matter.
They did.

58:23.600 --> 58:24.828
You son of a bitch.

58:27.920 --> 58:29.035
Leo?

58:32.680 --> 58:33.680
Leo?
Move.

58:36.280 --> 58:37.280
Leo.

58:45.200 --> 58:46.553
Oh!

58:47.560 --> 58:49.471
Leo, what the hell
are you doing?

58:57.440 --> 58:58.440
Leo, what...

59:03.800 --> 59:06.872
Trace bullet.
That's how he found us.

59:07.120 --> 59:08.792
Just leave it
here and drive away.

59:08.880 --> 59:10.096
They'll never know
we left here.

59:10.120 --> 59:13.908
Yeah, well, I wish it were that simple.
You all need to see this.

59:19.360 --> 59:22.511
There's a whole bunch of
negroes coming right this way.

59:22.840 --> 59:23.840
And we sitting up here

59:23.920 --> 59:26.195
like a bucket of motherfucking chicken.

59:38.240 --> 59:39.753
What's your ETA?

59:40.800 --> 59:42.313
Two minutes, Earl.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.399
Open the door, now!

59:54.160 --> 59:55.309
What are we gonna do?

59:55.400 --> 59:56.496
They'll start
blasting if we move.

59:56.520 --> 59:57.919
They'll start blasting
if we don't.

59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.391
Open the door!
Open the door, now!

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.551
Open the goddamn doors!

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.315
What's the plan?

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.237
Yo, yo, yo!
Quiet down! Quiet down!

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.880
- What the hell is that?
- Quiet down!

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.960
I know what I heard.
I know what I heard.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:24.391
I told you I ain't no saint.
Everybody's got a past.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:27.278
That was a Crip whistle.
They just threw it back.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:30.352
If this is the right set,
we should be good.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.712
I know, I know
what I heard. I know.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.794
All right.

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:45.873
We're not gonna hurt you.
Just help my fuckin' boy. He's gonna die.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.158
We help you,

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.751
you do something
for us.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:58.896
They're still under the overpass,
but they're on the move.

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:00.797
Get your asses in there.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.436
They stopped.
Stop the truck.

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.199
We're going on foot.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:36.875
Clear!

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:54.636
Earl, we found the trace bullet,
but no sign of the target.

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:56.478
Yeah, we're heading back.

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:09.518
Ground unit, come in.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.472
Ground unit, come in.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:15.549
Come in, I need a fuckin' sitrep.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.760
Fuck you, motherfucker!

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:26.319
No one following.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.149
We're clear.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.237
We're a few blocks away.

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:34.196
I'm gonna call in and tell
them we have a special guest.

01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.235
Where are we?

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.029
You'll see.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.068
What is this place?

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.358
We call this
a Safe Zone.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.718
Senator, Dante Bishop.
Mr. Bishop.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.279
This is Angel.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.352
Dawn called. Told me you
guys were coming through.

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.794
So the NFFA came
at you tonight?

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.430
Can't say
I'm surprised.

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.913
Let me show you around,
get you settled in.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.753
You set all this
up, Mr. Bishop?

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.398
Yes, this is
my organization.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.157
We have doctors, and
nurses, EMTs, paramedics.

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:55.356
This is their way of
protesting this damn night.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.718
How many people
know about this place?

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:06.634
Just the volunteers, and the
homeless that we invite in.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.072
Look, these are the real
victims of the Purge.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.351
The people that the NFFA
are trying to eliminate

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:17.193
so that they don't have to
take care of them anymore.

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:22.271
These men that are armed,

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:24.635
you'll have them at all the
entrances and the rooftop?

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.109
Yes. My men will
keep you safe.

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:29.910
Or as safe as you
can be on Purge Night.

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.039
Appreciate it.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.028
Mr. Bishop.
Yeah.

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:41.793
Thank you, for all of this.
I am impressed.

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:45.272
Well, don't thank me.
Thank the volunteers.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:48.877
Mr. Bishop,
I've heard stories

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:53.550
of tactics that you
employ on Purge Night.

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.189
I can't say that
I agree with any of it.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.473
I'll tell you what.

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.069
You get elected,

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.438
you stop this night,

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:08.238
and I don't have
to do what I do anymore.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.159
Let's go, Angel.

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.388
Fair enough.

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.073
You hold down
the fort here.

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:30.153
Keep an eye on her. And keep her
and her people quiet. Okay?

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.713
All right,
let's go!

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.632
I want access to every
surveillance camera in the city.

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:14.110
We'll do a grid search
for that fucking triage van.

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.708
It's out there somewhere.
Find it.

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:24.520
Yeah.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:27.797
Your crew? Your guys?
They feel like family?

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:32.680
Boss.

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.638
We did the
right thing.

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:38.880
Yeah.

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.592
But it's time to go.

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.593
Gotta get back
to the deli.

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:48.836
What? No. Are you fucking crazy?
We're safe here.

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:51.070
Laney, you know I'll
walk back if I have to.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:54.031
Fine. I'll drive you.

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:57.512
But if we run into any problems,
we're coming right back here.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:58.600
Deal.

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.520
Really? Can you do that?

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:10.075
We'll see her
again, Marcos.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.358
And she's safe here.

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:14.674
Let's hit it.

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:21.757
I don't know, but I bet it
was really cool.

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:23.874
It is, it is.

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:28.078
Hey, you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:29.480
Good.

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:31.875
I'm gonna go take a look around.
Okay.

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:33.629
Stay here.

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.313
Okay, boss.

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:06.877
What are you
doing here?

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:10.075
Hand.
Why are you here?

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:21.073
What the hell's
going on here?

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:23.310
He was snooping around!
Hey, hey! Okay, okay, okay.

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:26.189
Hey! Hey.
It's all right. It's all right.

01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:28.754
Red, back up.
It's okay.

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:31.993
Just put the gun down, all right?
Everybody's okay.

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.149
Back up.

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:34.828
We're okay.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:38.470
All right?
All right?

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.634
We're good.
It's all good, okay?

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.392
I'm just getting
my weapon.

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:45.519
What's going on?

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.828
Just doing my job.

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:48.558
Senator, it's just
a misunderstanding.

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.517
Why don't we
go back outside?

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:51.988
Come on.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:56.936
Are you seeing this, Leo?

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.439
Yes, Senator.

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:00.113
Senator, why don't
we go outside...

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.200
Stop.

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:06.108
Those are the Minister's
biggest financial supporters.

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.038
The NFFA.

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:12.429
Our Lady of Sorrows.

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:18.034
Is that where the Minister is going
to be tonight for the Purge Mass?

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:20.111
- We believe so.
- You believe...

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.553
What is all this?

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.636
Why do you have all this?

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:36.597
You're gonna assassinate him.

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:42.472
You're gonna assassinate the
Minister tonight, aren't you?

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.840
You know, somebody's
got to say it out loud.

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:51.958
What in the fuck
happened tonight?

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.712
Nobody's gonna
believe it.

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:54.800
Mmm-hmm.

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:58.439
Irish Ike's gonna
be like, "Bullshit.

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:01.950
"Now where's my waffles and pussy?"
"...and pussy?"

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.238
He got that
one-track mind.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.436
That boy done
lost his mind.

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:09.589
Shit.

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:12.993
I hope he's
okay tonight.

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:15.915
Yeah.

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:23.192
Hold on, guys.
Look.

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:27.311
Those are
government trucks.

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:30.074
I saw them on YouTube
from last year's Purge.

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:32.915
And they're going straight
back towards the Safe Zone.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:37.555
You cannot do this. I need to win
this thing fair and fucking square.

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:40.950
They are not playing fair and fucking
square and neither should we.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:43.270
This church will be
locked up like Fort Knox.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.560
You'll never get through.
You're gonna get slaughtered.

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.950
Four churches were
built on that site.

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:51.316
The original by your boy George
Washington over 200 years ago.

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:54.233
The man liked to have escape tunnels
attached to all his structures.

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:55.639
They're all over D.C.

01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:57.517
The tunnel under
the original church

01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:59.750
has been closed up
since the '50s.

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:01.068
But we reopened it.

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:02.560
We're gonna walk
right through there

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:05.592
and into that church without
anybody even knowing it.

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:09.514
The original Founding Fathers are about
to fuck over the New Founding Fathers.

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.909
Now how you like
that for irony?

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:15.151
How do you know where
this mass is gonna be?

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:18.835
Because we do whatever it takes.
We did this for you, Senator.

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:21.576
No, it's not for me. Get your boss
on the phone. I need to talk to him.

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.830
He's not here.
Angel, listen to me.

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:25.035
You call him.

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:29.830
You tell him he does this and
the Minister becomes a martyr.

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:33.037
I cannot have my presidency
built on murder. You see that.

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:35.549
He will not leave
this to the voters.

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:37.676
He does not believe
in the American system.

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:39.296
Angel, believe in me.
I can make this happen.

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:41.096
We do. That's why we're
trying to pave a way for you

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.696
to the White House
so you can make changes.

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:44.056
You're gonna
cost me the White House.

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:46.640
It's Laney. She says there's
trucks approaching us.

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:47.720
What?

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.229
Who is that?

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:53.913
Government soldiers.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.356
That's the NFFA eliminating
all their enemies this year.

01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:00.352
They're here for Bishop,
but they will kill you.

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:02.776
You need to evacuate your people.
We can't move the injured.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:05.792
I need to get her out of here now.
There's a way out back.

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.074
Where does it
come out?

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:08.878
The alleyway down to
Third and Thompson.

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.640
Third and Thompson.
Give me the phone.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.634
Laney, I need you
at Third and Thompson now.

01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:15.312
Yeah, we'll meet
you there.

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:23.475
So, we're driving right
back into that war zone?

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.153
Stupid!

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.314
All these people.

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:42.879
We'll protect them.

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:44.837
Please, stop
the assassination.

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:47.394
It's too late. Now go.
Stay safe. Go!

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.713
So what we supposed to be, like
some superheroes or something?

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:54.915
That ain't what I do.

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.674
I hate this night!

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:03.832
Ah, shit. Hell with it.
Come on. Shit.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.678
Let's do it.
Let's go get 'em.

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:11.916
I can't believe
we're outside again.

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:14.359
I'm gonna get
you through this.

01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:27.756
My God, it's so close!

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:30.120
At your own risk now!

01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:32.398
Are you fucking
kidding me?

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.629
Ready?
Yeah.

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.358
- One.
- Go for it!

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:37.714
- Two.
- Try your luck!

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:39.315
Go!

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:43.389
Good luck out there!

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:50.189
Let me
hear you whisper

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:54.637
That you love me too

01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:01.670
Keep the love-light glowing
in your eyes so true

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:02.909
Let's go, let's go!

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.229
Come on, I got you.

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.474
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:11.835
Thank you. Again.

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:13.309
Where we headed?

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.391
Drive. Out of this city.
Get us out of here.

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:28.720
You okay, Senator?

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:32.874
No, Marcos. I'm not.

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.876
This night
corrupts everyone.

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.196
Senator.
I can't win like this.

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:47.350
It goes against everything
that I believe in.

01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:50.677
We need to focus on one thing
right now and that's survival.

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:52.910
I need to make sure you
get through this night.

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:56.713
I have to stop them
from killing the Minister.

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:57.800
What?

01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:01.475
If they assassinate him,
he becomes a martyr. We lose.

01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:05.228
Yeah. And how
do we do that?

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:06.958
I don't know.
We have to do something.

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:12.074
Do what? Do what? You're willing to
risk your life to save an assassin...

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:37.748
Everybody all right?

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:40.472
Joe, you okay?

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.114
I'll be okay.

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:43.514
Leo!

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.068
Gun!

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:11.876
I know where they're taking her.
I know why she's still alive.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:12.960
Where?

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:15.713
You find a safe place
to hide and you stay there.

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.711
No. No way.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:21.473
Whatever it is you plan on doing,
we're coming with you.

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:25.835
Let's go.

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:04.116
May the Purge
protect us. Keep us pure.

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:06.197
Purge and purify.

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:11.792
May the Purge cleanse us.
Keep us pure.

01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:14.839
Purge and purify.

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:19.513
May the Purge cleanse us.
Keep us pure.

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:22.674
Purge and purify.

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.796
Come on, guys,
that's enough.

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:29.197
We're getting paid to deliver
the package, not gift-wrap it.

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:34.199
Come on, let's go find a place to wait
out the rest of this fucking night, huh.

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:40.470
As we always do.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.231
Blessed be
the New Founding Fathers

01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:48.155
for letting us Purge
and cleanse our souls.

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:52.633
Blessed be America,
a nation reborn.

01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:59.271
Well, it's been
a long journey

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:02.955
to get away from the lies
and the self-deception

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:08.640
to this place of knowledge and
awareness of who we really are.

01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:13.029
People of flesh,
immensely flawed.

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:16.195
It's hard to see
the ugly truth.

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:19.829
But change can only
come from acceptance.

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:23.476
And change we must,
as it is our godly duty

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:26.399
to get rid of the fury
and the hatred

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:28.995
that poisons our souls,
makes us sick.

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.151
Makes us ugly.

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:33.755
Tonight,

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:37.876
we, the leaders of
this great country,

01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:43.268
will sin, scour, sanitize
and sterilize our souls

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:48.309
until we are free again, and this
country will be better for it.

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:53.595
We are not hypocrites!

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:57.919
We practice what we preach.

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:02.429
Purge and purify!
Say it with me.

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:07.152
Purge and purify!
Purge and purify!

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:11.836
Purge and purify!
Purge and purify!

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.230
Purge and purify!

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:16.311
Let us begin.

01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:19.154
All right, look, it's after midnight.
We need to move.

01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.798
I need a four-man
team in there.

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:23.110
I need three with me.
Got it? Go!

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:24.872
Bishop!

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:27.789
Bishop!

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:36.360
Bishop!

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:41.555
Bishop!

01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:47.359
I'm unarmed.

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:50.636
How well do you
know this Dante?

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:53.075
Not well. So keep
your eye on him.

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:56.075
Our boy is gonna
get himself killed.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:57.829
I'm unarmed.

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:01.591
You know this
lunatic, Dante?

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:04.677
Yeah. I do.

01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:07.394
Guns down.

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:11.152
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:14.196
Trying to get
yourself killed?

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:18.397
Is that the tunnel
for the cathedral?

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:21.590
How the fuck do you
know about the tunnel?

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:26.872
I asked you a question.

01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:36.879
This is no longer an assassination.
This is a rescue mission.

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:41.677
Jesus died for their sins.

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.790
And now,
our modern-day martyrs

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:50.235
will die for our trespasses.

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:57.118
Our martyr's name
is Lawrence.

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:02.677
A lifelong drug addict.
He wants to make amends.

01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:07.953
He wants to serve his God
and his government.

01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:11.950
Let's thank Lawrence
for his gift.

01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:13.792
Thank you, Lawrence.

01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:18.913
Thank you for your gift, Lawrence.
Thank you very much, Lawrence.

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.238
We love you,
Lawrence.

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:33.475
These weapons have been
cleansed with holy water,

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:38.476
and they are now
instruments of destruction.

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:42.680
Fuck!

01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:48.715
You all know
the loyal Harmon James.

01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:52.630
Worked with the NFFA
tirelessly for many years.

01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:57.070
Harmon will be the first
Purger of the evening.

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:09.516
I'm sorry. No, no, no. Please,
please, please, please. No, no, no.

01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:14.272
Please, no, no!
I'm sorry! No, please!

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:17.433
No! I'm sorry!
Please, no, no!

01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:19.559
Please, no!

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:24.035
Please! No!
Please, please!

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:25.758
I'm sorry!
Release, Harmon.

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:28.040
No!

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:33.560
No!

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:37.510
Release the violence
from your darkened heart!

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:40.637
Scour your soul.
Let the light in.

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:44.075
You are blood-baptized.

01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:47.715
And you are born again!

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:57.593
His light entered
your heart, Harmon.

01:25:58.920 --> 01:25:59.920
Yeah.

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:07.550
The power of Purging!

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:09.671
Purge and purify!

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.230
Purge and purify!

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:16.154
Purge and purify!
Purge and purify!

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:20.793
Purge and purify!

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:28.160
Psst.

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:31.519
No matter what happens,
we stay together.

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:37.148
All right, this takes us
to the mechanical room.

01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:39.470
From there, we can
access the cathedral.

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:51.478
Stay there.
Where do we go?

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:54.797
The church is above us.
So are 50 Secret Service agents.

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:57.189
You're gonna take the
staircase to the balcony.

01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:00.272
Me and my guys, we're gonna enter from
behind the altar and this side here.

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.960
Okay, good. Let's go
get our girl, yeah?

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:12.792
Before we get to our communal Purge,
the Holy Horde of Many Martyrs,

01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:16.474
I'd like to introduce
a guest

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:22.393
who's going to be the centerpiece of a
very special Purge ceremony tonight.

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.394
This person

01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:31.475
has threatened to
dismantle everything

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:34.592
that we, New Founding
Fathers, have done.

01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:41.955
We must rid ourselves

01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:49.875
of the negative emotions
that she has stirred inside.

01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:56.274
We must stop her from
poisoning our great country

01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:59.957
by taking away
our freedoms.

01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:04.360
Yes!

01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:21.034
I would like all the Founding
Fathers to come to the altar.

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:23.033
Join me, brothers,

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:26.712
as we eliminate evil

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:29.557
and Purge as one.

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:35.878
There is a fountain
filled with blood

01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:40.352
Drawn from Immanuel's veins

01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:46.911
And sinners,
plunged beneath that flood

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:53.395
Lose all their
guilty stains

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.599
Lord of Air,

01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:08.832
Lord of Earth,

01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:13.357
we ask that you receive this
child into your loving arms.

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:21.389
We are sinners.

01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:23.238
Let us release.

01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:27.228
Caleb, our leader,

01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:30.597
I invite you, sir,
to lead us in this Purging

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:34.709
as you have
and as you will.

01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:47.752
Blessed be our New Founding
Fathers for letting us Purge.

01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:05.716
Blessed be America,
a nation reborn.

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:07.389
Rifle!

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:06.678
She's alive.

01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:11.989
Down!

01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:39.958
Where you all at?

01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:47.071
The hell are you
all doing up there?

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:51.591
Bring your asses
down here.

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:56.794
My negro.

01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:59.035
Let's go.

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:12.952
- Thank you.
- I got you. I got you.

01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:23.720
Hi.

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:27.276
You okay?
Yeah.

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:31.116
Thank you. Again.

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:34.360
What was that?

01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:36.954
My men taking care of business.
Go cover me.

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:41.112
We're headed out.
Back exit. We have her.

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:43.877
And we have him.

01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:48.760
Move.

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:51.040
Hey!

01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:53.456
- Listen to me.
- Get off of me.

01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:55.550
- Mr. Bishop. Please.
- Watch our backs.

01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:57.358
Just take a second
and listen to me.

01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:00.074
It's on our way to the exit.
I can win without this.

01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:01.536
Please!
Cover our backs.

01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:03.755
You will win.
I'm gonna make sure that happens.

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:05.159
Open up!
Stop.

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:08.240
This is murder.
If you do this,

01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:10.231
you will be no
different than them.

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:11.320
Get her.

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.998
Nope! Don't.

01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:15.519
Listen to her.

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:16.999
She knows
what she's doing.

01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:19.591
We don't need to do this.

01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:21.432
Hang on, Dante.

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:23.192
Get the fuck
out of my way.

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:25.719
Wait, please!

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:35.998
Don't do this.

01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:39.790
If you do this, you will
be no different than them.

01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:44.872
We can't be like them.

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:50.634
Look at me.

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:04.275
Purge,

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:06.439
my son.

01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:09.071
Purge.

01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:12.710
It's your right
as an American.

01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:16.549
Kill me. Kill me.

01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:18.389
Purge.

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:20.717
You're a son of God.

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:25.552
God wants you to Purge.
Shut the fuck up!

01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:28.275
Coward.

01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:31.074
Purge!

01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:34.832
Do it! Do it! Yes! Yes!

01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:36.753
Kill me!

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:42.510
Now, I'm gonna tell you right
now, I like black people,

01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:45.994
but I ain't gonna let you all
shoot these white folks.

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:47.513
These are our white people.

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:48.600
Okay?

01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:51.915
So, let's put 'em down.

01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:05.872
You better fucking win.

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.231
Go. Go.

01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:15.475
Move!

01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:38.473
Oh, my God.

01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:43.674
You murderous pig.

01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:47.909
I am gonna beat the shit out
of you on election day.

01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:57.235
I'm not as politically
correct as the Senator.

01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:06.958
Good night,
blue cheese.

01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:11.438
Well played, Leo.

01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:12.714
Thanks, Joe.

01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:16.508
Come on, man.

01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:19.268
No, I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.032
We have to get
you out of there.

01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:22.872
Stay here,
we'll find a vehicle.

01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:24.440
What about these people?

01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:37.551
Back, back, back!
Get back!

01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:39.835
You got this.
You know I got this.

01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:46.913
How bad is it?
Not good.

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:52.752
Look, I got one more move in me.
Cover me. Go!

01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:32.389
Shh! Be quiet!

01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:34.914
Shut him up before he draws
the wrong kind of attention.

01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:15.717
You motherfucker!

01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:34.840
Get up.

01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:16.879
Motherfucker.

01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:23.873
Okay. No, it's okay. You're safe.
Thank you.

01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:27.111
I gotta get the fuck outta here!
Let me out! Let me out!

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:28.200
Stop him!

01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:21.280
Joe!

01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:23.600
Joe?

01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:25.835
You're gonna be okay,
Joe. Come on.

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:27.200
We gotta get you
somewhere, okay?

01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:29.037
You're gonna be okay.
I promise you.

01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:31.315
There's nowhere
to take me.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.753
You're gonna be fine.
That's what's important.

01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:40.119
She's gonna make sure of it.
Right, Senator?

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:42.028
Yeah.

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:52.953
You got this.

01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:57.394
I got this.

01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:02.315
Marcos...

01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:13.711
Joe, Joe, Joe.

01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:15.680
Breathe, Joe, breathe.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.000
No.

01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:22.478
Wake up, Joe.
Wake up!

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:24.160
Joe!

01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:56.440
That was
Senator Roan this morning,

01:41:56.520 --> 01:41:58.511
casting the first
vote of the day.

01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:00.636
It's been a great day
for the senator so far,

01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:03.149
having already won New York,
California, and...

01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:06.438
Wait, hold on, I am
getting word, right now,

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:09.159
that the Senator has
also taken Florida,

01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:13.552
which puts her well over the 270
electoral votes for the win.

01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:14.640
So that is it.

01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:19.032
It is now official, the next President of
the United States will be Charlie Roan.

01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:22.954
And President-elect Roan has already
stated that her first order of business

01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:26.794
will be taking executive action
to put an end to the Purge.

01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:27.880
Updates?

01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:30.468
It's a landslide.

01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:41.317
All right, I'll come by tomorrow.
We can get started on the ceiling.

01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:42.628
Sounds good.

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:56.229
This place is really
coming along, Marcos.

01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:00.038
Joe would be
really happy.

01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:05.157
I'll catch you
later, kid.

01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:24.877
We're just
now hearing reports

01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:27.235
about a few scattered
incidents around the country

01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:31.438
where NFFA supporters are reacting
violently to this defeat.

01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:36.674
They are burning cars, breaking windows,
looting, attacking police officers...
