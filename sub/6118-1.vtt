00:32.534 --> 00:35.196
Everyone, please take
your seats. You heard the bell.

00:35.270 --> 00:38.034
You know what it means.
Last week,

00:38.106 --> 00:45.376
the assignment was
to write an essay about your family.

00:45.447 --> 00:48.939
- Who they...
- Are!

00:49.017 --> 00:51.008
And what they...

00:51.086 --> 00:53.350
Mean to us!

00:53.421 --> 00:56.913
Excellent droning. So I want
everyone to take out their essays.

00:57.159 --> 01:01.596
We're going to read them aloud
to the class right up here.

01:02.364 --> 01:10.100
My mom says that me and my dad
have very healthy appetites.

01:10.172 --> 01:12.902
My mom and dad are very religious.

01:12.974 --> 01:17.707
When they're in their bedroom at night,
I always hear them yelling, “Jesus!”

01:17.779 --> 01:23.740
My mom says my dad's eyes are brown
because he is so full of sh...

01:23.818 --> 01:24.807
Brian!

01:25.921 --> 01:28.253
My brother Jack is in eighth grade.

01:28.323 --> 01:30.951
He told me to ask my dad
who he voted for...

01:31.026 --> 01:32.857
for... for President.

01:32.928 --> 01:35.988
I did and my Dad said
he's a total Bush-man.

01:36.064 --> 01:39.227
That made my brother laugh really hard.

01:40.302 --> 01:43.965
Whenever my Uncle Stu
comes over to play pool with my dad,

01:44.039 --> 01:49.170
my mom says the basement smells
like a Cheech and Chong movie.

01:49.244 --> 01:51.712
Well... it's like this.

01:51.780 --> 01:54.408
My dog ate my paper.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.473
I checked, but he didn't poop it out.

01:58.553 --> 02:00.487
What a lovely sentiment,
Mr. Etheridge.

02:00.555 --> 02:04.082
Maybe your dog can eat the zero
you'll be receiving too.

02:04.159 --> 02:07.993
- Aw, man!
- Harsh.

02:08.062 --> 02:11.226
Miss Trinke?
It's your turn now.

02:23.745 --> 02:27.181
My dad says life can be
split into two categories:

02:27.249 --> 02:30.377
New Jersey... and New York.

02:43.765 --> 02:46.063
My dad was a Jersey boy
who became the youngest

02:46.134 --> 02:49.262
and most successful music publicist
in New York City.

02:49.337 --> 02:53.467
By the time he was 27,
he had 100 people working for him.

02:53.541 --> 02:58.137
And even though they all loved him,
he loved them even more.

02:58.213 --> 03:01.671
My fellow flacks and spin doctors.

03:02.317 --> 03:03.841
Salud.

03:03.918 --> 03:08.412
Daddy loved his job,
but not as much as he loved my mom.

03:09.024 --> 03:12.482
Mommy was a book editor in
New York City when her and Daddy met.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.051
Daddy said their jobs
were kind of the same...

03:15.130 --> 03:17.894
they made slight corrections
for their clients.

03:17.966 --> 03:23.700
Because George Michael is a pimp
who is all about the ladies, my friend.

03:23.772 --> 03:27.264
Come on, “I Want Your Sex”?
That sound like he's singing to a guy?

03:28.143 --> 03:32.341
Daddy worked so much that sometimes
Mommy could only see him late at night.

03:33.114 --> 03:36.572
Daddy says that's why they
both loved the city so much...

03:36.651 --> 03:38.642
it never went to sleep.

03:40.922 --> 03:43.652
And neither did him and Mommy.

03:43.758 --> 03:46.386
But after a year of romance
in New York City,

03:46.461 --> 03:49.259
Daddy said it was time
to show Mommy where he came from.

03:50.365 --> 03:54.563
So he took her home to New Jersey
and put her through what he said

03:54.636 --> 03:58.299
was the biggest test
their love would ever face:

03:58.373 --> 04:00.841
“Introducing her to my pop. “

04:03.611 --> 04:05.602
- Hey, how are ya?
- How're ya doin'?

04:05.680 --> 04:08.046
- How're ya doin' yourself?
- This is Gertrude.

04:08.116 --> 04:10.846
Hi. Merry Christmas.

04:12.220 --> 04:16.656
- And what do you do, Mr. Trinke?
- Easy on the “Mr. Trinke”. It's Bart.

04:16.725 --> 04:18.851
I work for the borough,
for 30 years now.

04:18.927 --> 04:22.363
He's the only man in Highlands
licensed to operate the street sweeper.

04:22.430 --> 04:25.627
Oh, man, I always wanted
to ride in one of those things.

04:25.700 --> 04:29.659
Well, you continue seeing my son,
I can probably get you a turn at the wheel.

04:29.738 --> 04:33.640
I was only gonna sleep with him
a few more times and then dump him,

04:33.708 --> 04:35.335
but now, after an offer like that...

04:35.410 --> 04:37.970
Holy shit.
Listen to the mouth on this one!

04:38.046 --> 04:40.446
Oh, yeah, they don't make 'em
like Mom anymore, do they, Dad?

04:40.515 --> 04:43.848
- Now, listen, I'm goin' to the bar.
- What a shock.

04:43.918 --> 04:47.354
If you guys are gonna do anything while
I'm gone, stay the hell off of my bed.

04:47.422 --> 04:51.825
- You're going to a bar?
- Didn't he tell ya? I'm an alcoholic.

04:51.893 --> 04:55.727
- Well, I wanna go to the bar too.
- No, you don't wanna go to this bar.

04:55.797 --> 04:58.732
It's a bunch of old guys talkin' about
how good they had it under Kennedy.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.030
The man was a goddamn saint.

05:01.102 --> 05:04.936
I'm goin' to the bar with your dad.
You can come if you want.

05:05.006 --> 05:06.974
No, that's OK.
I'll stay here and do the dishes.

05:07.041 --> 05:08.941
I only cooked.
Why shouldn't I clean?

05:09.010 --> 05:11.740
Suit yourself.
But don't wash that pan.

05:11.813 --> 05:16.250
I got a layer of juice built up for the pork
roll, and I don't want you scrubbin' it off.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.285
That “juice” is called grease, Dad.

05:18.353 --> 05:20.446
It's bad for you.
It clogs your arteries.

05:20.522 --> 05:23.980
It's called juice.
And it greases a father's insides

05:24.058 --> 05:27.687
so that he can better swallow
the shit his son feeds him twice a year

05:27.762 --> 05:29.753
when he can be bothered
coming to visit him.

05:30.598 --> 05:33.761
So that night,
Daddy took Mommy to Pop's bar,

05:34.702 --> 05:37.262
where she got to meet
Pop's other children,

05:37.338 --> 05:39.806
his best friends Greenie and Block.

05:40.642 --> 05:43.304
Hey, your kid's cuttin' a rug.

05:47.882 --> 05:49.577
Who are you, Connie Chung?

05:51.152 --> 05:55.885
Daddy said, because Mommy
survived her first trip to Jersey,

05:55.957 --> 05:58.118
he knew she was a keeper.

06:03.031 --> 06:08.992
He said they celebrated their
engagement by going out for pizza.

06:09.971 --> 06:12.565
And that's how I got here.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.302
Do we have enough of these at home,
or should I steal some?

06:15.376 --> 06:18.209
If you're gonna steal something,
steal some rubber gloves.

06:32.627 --> 06:36.085
- Thank you!
- You're welcome!

06:37.098 --> 06:40.864
And with that,
everyone lived happily ever after.

06:41.536 --> 06:42.969
Almost.

06:43.037 --> 06:45.597
Look, you've got two minutes,
and then we have to go, OK?

06:45.673 --> 06:47.903
- Or I'm gonna leave.
- Would you stop rushing me?

06:47.976 --> 06:51.537
I don't understand how somebody who had
all day sitting around to get ready

06:51.613 --> 06:53.376
waits till 20 minutes
before we have to leave!

06:53.448 --> 06:55.678
You try getting anything accomplished
with this big gut in your way!

06:55.750 --> 06:59.049
This is one of the few days of the year
that I can be fired for being late!

06:59.120 --> 07:04.080
Anytime that you wanna carry this baby,
Ollie, you let me know! OK?

07:04.158 --> 07:07.321
I would be glad to go back to wearing
regular dresses instead of this tent!

07:07.395 --> 07:09.727
The dress looks fine.
It's gorgeous, OK? It's beautiful.

07:09.797 --> 07:12.061
Yeah, until I'm standing next to
Janet Jackson or Sheryl Crow.

07:12.133 --> 07:13.930
Then you'll see how not fine it looks.

07:14.002 --> 07:17.096
Gertie, I asked you, please,
to use your own brush, OK?

07:17.171 --> 07:19.036
- Can you just not use my brush?
- Don't start.

07:19.107 --> 07:20.870
It's just that
every time I wanna comb my hair

07:20.942 --> 07:25.470
I spend 15 minutes taking these
long, bushy hairs out of my brush.

07:25.547 --> 07:27.174
And I mean, you ask me to...

07:29.017 --> 07:30.416
I'm sorry.

07:30.485 --> 07:33.852
Baby, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

07:33.922 --> 07:37.551
You don't understand
what it's like to be this fat!

07:37.625 --> 07:40.594
I've always been thin,
and now I'm a disgusting pig!

07:40.662 --> 07:43.324
And it's my first time
going to the Video Music Awards

07:43.398 --> 07:47.562
and all the other girls are gonna be
skinny, and I'm gonna look like a whale!

07:47.635 --> 07:51.799
Baby, baby, they're just skinny
'cause they're all coked-out whores.

07:51.873 --> 07:54.341
I wanna be a coked-out whore!

07:54.409 --> 07:56.400
OK, you can be a coked-out whore too.

07:56.477 --> 07:59.913
You can be a coked-out, coked-out whore.

07:59.981 --> 08:02.882
- I'm sorry.
- I should be more sensitive. I'm sorry.

08:02.951 --> 08:05.545
I should be more sensitive, honey.
I know.

08:05.620 --> 08:07.315
- Yes.
- I know.

08:07.388 --> 08:10.448
- Baby, we have to go now, OK?
- OK.

08:10.525 --> 08:12.891
- I love you. We have to go now.
- OK.

08:12.961 --> 08:15.452
- I love you too.
- All right, let's go. OK?

08:15.530 --> 08:18.397
Just give me two minutes.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.791
- What time is it?
- 20 after.

08:20.868 --> 08:24.167
- She's gonna kill me!
- I need the quote for the Madonna release.

08:24.238 --> 08:29.870
OK. “Madonna trusts the public
will judge for itself that...

08:29.944 --> 08:33.345
this latest in a long line
of breakthrough music videos

08:33.414 --> 08:36.474
is not the tasteless sexploitation
it's accused of being.”

08:36.551 --> 08:40.749
- “It's artistic expression.”
- Of what?

08:40.822 --> 08:46.192
Of one woman's constant need
to show the world... her labia.

08:48.429 --> 08:51.557
Hey, can I use the word “labia”
in a press release?

09:11.252 --> 09:13.243
See you next week.

09:16.090 --> 09:19.958
One of these days, I'll get me one of
those husbands that show up for Lamaze.

09:20.028 --> 09:22.588
I'm sorry, babe. It was Madonna.

09:22.664 --> 09:25.792
So you were late
because of another woman. That's nice.

09:25.867 --> 09:29.496
- Come on. I still gotta do my job.
- And I still gotta do mine too.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.663
But I was at Lamaze on time.

09:34.409 --> 09:35.967
Look, all I'm saying is

09:36.044 --> 09:40.276
that guy who used to spend all night at the
office and barely live in his apartment?

09:40.348 --> 09:42.339
That's not you anymore.

09:42.417 --> 09:44.942
Now you have to be the guy
who's done by six

09:45.019 --> 09:48.978
and comes home
and hangs out with his family.

09:49.057 --> 09:51.389
That's the only way we're gonna work.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.492
OK?

09:56.898 --> 09:58.422
OK.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.731
- OK.
- OK.

10:00.802 --> 10:02.793
OK!

10:04.605 --> 10:05.902
- OK.
- OK.

10:11.312 --> 10:13.644
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

10:13.715 --> 10:16.548
My wife's water broke.
She's gonna have a baby.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.847
- You're gonna have to check in, hon.
- Check in?!

10:18.920 --> 10:22.879
Where, at the concierge desk?! Why
are you being so combative with me?!

10:22.957 --> 10:26.393
First of all,
take your hands off my uniform.

10:26.461 --> 10:29.919
And second,
I'm gonna need a patient here.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.829
This is my wife.
This is the belligerent nurse

10:35.903 --> 10:38.667
that's being so difficult with me,
giving me such a hard time.

10:38.740 --> 10:42.073
- I'm sorry. He's a little panicky.
- Can I get a wheelchair?

10:42.143 --> 10:43.838
- Let's get you up to delivery...
- OK.

10:43.911 --> 10:45.879
- ...and let him fill out the paperwork.
- OK.

10:45.947 --> 10:48.415
- If we can trust him with a pen.
- Here, sweetie.

10:48.483 --> 10:50.883
OK, just relax, breathe.
Remember, take it easy.

10:50.952 --> 10:53.045
I love you.
I'll be right there, OK? I love you.

10:53.121 --> 10:55.214
- I love you too.
- OK, I love you.

10:55.289 --> 10:59.248
We've practiced this 1,000 times.
It'll be great. How hard can it be?

11:00.728 --> 11:04.960
- Push! You're doing good.
- You're doing real good.

11:05.032 --> 11:07.796
- No, I can't! I can't do it!
- Take a breath.

11:07.869 --> 11:10.667
- It hurts!
- I know it hurts.

11:10.738 --> 11:13.798
It's OK, baby.
Push. You can do it.

11:13.875 --> 11:17.038
Take a deep breath.
In five, four...

11:17.111 --> 11:19.409
- OK? Here you go.
- ...three, two, one.

11:19.480 --> 11:22.972
Push. Push harder, Gertie.
Push harder.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.678
The baby's crowning. I can see her.
I just need one more push.

11:25.753 --> 11:28.221
- Can you see her?
- Holy shit! I can see the head!

11:28.289 --> 11:31.816
- One more. Breathe.
- Push! It's almost there, baby.

11:31.893 --> 11:33.918
Push! You're doing it. Push!

11:33.995 --> 11:36.156
Push!

11:38.032 --> 11:40.296
Here she comes! Here she comes!

11:40.368 --> 11:42.768
Here she is.

11:42.837 --> 11:45.362
- Do you wanna cut the cord, Dad?
- Yeah.

11:45.439 --> 11:46.838
Scissors, please.

11:46.908 --> 11:52.813
Yes! And she's got all ten fingers,
ten toes.

11:52.880 --> 11:57.408
We'll get her all cleaned up
and then we're gonna check...

11:57.485 --> 11:58.474
Gertie?

11:58.553 --> 12:00.453
- Baby, look.
- Gertie?

12:01.088 --> 12:02.419
Gertie!

12:03.424 --> 12:05.483
Gertie, can you hear me?

12:05.560 --> 12:09.087
- She's OK. Sweetheart?
- Nurse, get Dr. Mortimer right away!

12:09.163 --> 12:11.324
She's resting.
Who's Dr. Mortimer?

12:11.399 --> 12:12.388
Dr. Mortimer!

12:12.466 --> 12:14.400
- What's happening?
- She's unresponsive.

12:14.468 --> 12:16.163
- Gertie!
- Gertie! Gertie!

12:16.237 --> 12:19.206
Gertie, it's me! Gertie?

12:19.273 --> 12:21.503
Healthy baby. Unresponsive.

12:21.576 --> 12:24.010
- Respiratory arrest.
- Turn it around!

12:24.078 --> 12:27.605
- What's happening to my wife?
- Let's open that IV, please.

12:27.682 --> 12:31.413
Baby, are you OK?
Sweetheart, sweetheart, wake up!

12:31.485 --> 12:34.784
Please, someone take
Mr. Trinke outside. Please!

12:34.856 --> 12:36.881
I'm gonna have to intubate.

12:36.958 --> 12:39.222
Gertie, wake up, my love.
Wake up.

12:39.293 --> 12:41.386
Gertie, please. Wake up.

12:42.530 --> 12:45.090
Get off me! Gertie!

12:45.166 --> 12:48.499
I wanna stay with my wife!
Gertie! Gertie!

12:48.569 --> 12:50.560
What's happening?!

13:10.758 --> 13:13.659
- Ollie...
- If I don't get to go in there right now...

13:13.728 --> 13:15.195
- I swear to God!
- Ollie... Ollie, calm down.

13:15.263 --> 13:17.390
Fuck you, calm down! OK?!

13:17.465 --> 13:19.433
I got dragged out of there,
I haven't got to see my baby!

13:19.500 --> 13:22.799
Your baby is fine.
She's healthy, she's normal.

13:22.870 --> 13:26.601
- What's wrong with Gertie?
- I need you to calm down before I...

13:26.674 --> 13:29.336
Look, I'm calm! OK?!

13:33.314 --> 13:35.305
I'm calm.

13:36.417 --> 13:39.545
We think Gertie had an aneurysm.

13:41.856 --> 13:43.881
Is she OK?

13:46.227 --> 13:48.218
We lost her, Ollie.

13:49.597 --> 13:55.399
The strain of the contractions and the
pushing caused the aneurysm to rupture.

13:55.469 --> 13:58.438
There are rarely symptoms
for aneurysms...

You sure you're OK

15:44.145 --> 15:47.137
What, OK?
She's my granddaughter.

15:47.214 --> 15:51.480
Yeah, you can stay
with me anytime, can't you?

15:51.552 --> 15:53.349
Yes, you can.

15:53.421 --> 15:57.255
Until you're a teenager,
with the boys and a reefer.

15:57.324 --> 16:00.225
Then I don't wanna know about you.

16:00.761 --> 16:02.752
I wouldn't impose on you, you know.

16:02.830 --> 16:08.063
I just got a lot of work...
piled up from before and...

16:09.637 --> 16:13.937
- I'll be back late tonight, OK?
- Yeah, take your time.

16:17.912 --> 16:22.781
Your daddy really misses
your mommy, kid. I miss her too.

16:22.850 --> 16:24.943
Especially right now.

16:25.419 --> 16:27.944
Oh, Jesus!

16:36.430 --> 16:37.954
Yeah.

16:38.866 --> 16:41.699
- You wanted to see me, Ollie?
- Yeah, come on in.

16:43.571 --> 16:46.472
I didn't think you were gonna be in
this week. How you doin'?

16:46.540 --> 16:48.531
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

16:48.609 --> 16:51.942
Look, this piece in the Post.
Why didn't you call me when this broke?

16:52.012 --> 16:56.142
- I had to read about it in New Jersey.
- It's cool. The nurse is a fan.

16:56.217 --> 16:59.414
Will she still be a fan when the Enquirer
flashes a stack of 50s in her face?

16:59.487 --> 17:03.048
Listen, something like this breaks,
I'm not in the city,

17:03.124 --> 17:05.319
you find me or you find another job.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.053
Yeah, OK.

17:10.830 --> 17:12.093
OK.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.792
What else do we got?

17:15.869 --> 17:18.134
Will Smith.

17:18.204 --> 17:21.071
- Who?
- The Fresh Prince?

17:21.142 --> 17:23.576
“DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince”
Fresh Prince?

17:23.644 --> 17:25.236
- Yeah.
- What about him?

17:25.311 --> 17:28.406
You remember the first album,
the one with “Girls Ain't...

17:28.482 --> 17:30.746
- Rock the House. Yeah?
- Rock the House, right.

17:30.818 --> 17:35.755
You remember on the cover of the album
Jazzy Jeff is holding a model of a house?

17:35.823 --> 17:36.949
Vaguely.

17:37.024 --> 17:39.993
Will Smith is donating that house
to the Hard Rock Cafe.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.688
Well, stop the presses.
You put the word out yet?

17:42.763 --> 17:44.822
- Date pending, yeah.
- Anybody give a shit?

17:44.899 --> 17:49.632
- Every outlet wants in.
- You're kidding me?

17:49.703 --> 17:51.967
No.
Even US News and World Report.

17:52.540 --> 17:55.008
Why? It's an eight-year-old album.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.976
Doesn't matter. Everyone loves
that Fresh Prince TV show.

17:58.045 --> 18:01.776
He's got that movie coming out
in a couple of weeks, Independence Day.

18:01.849 --> 18:05.615
- Let the film division handle it.
- No, we can't.

18:05.686 --> 18:08.655
Will wants to keep his music career
separate from his movie career.

18:08.722 --> 18:12.988
Like the Fresh Prince of Bel Air
is ever gonna have a movie career.

18:14.094 --> 18:17.996
Get me everything you can. I'll put together
a press kit on him, and we'll just do it.

18:18.065 --> 18:18.554
OK.

18:18.632 --> 18:21.897
- Patty, get me Kirsch.
- Sure, Ollie.

18:21.969 --> 18:26.065
I can handle this Fresh Prince stuff
if you wanna take a couple of days...

18:26.140 --> 18:30.406
Hey, Arthur, I can do my job.
I'm all set, OK? You do your job. Go ahead.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.968
Patty, did you not hear me? I asked you
to please get Kirsch on the phone.

18:33.047 --> 18:34.344
- Ollie?
- I'm trying.

18:34.415 --> 18:35.677
What, man?

18:35.749 --> 18:39.241
I know I told you at the funeral,
but I'm really sorry...

18:39.320 --> 18:41.185
I'm fine.
OK, Arthur? I am fine!

18:41.255 --> 18:43.587
Please go do
what I asked you to do now.

18:43.657 --> 18:45.921
- Kirschner on one.
- OK! Put him on the phone then!

18:45.993 --> 18:48.553
- How's the baby?
- The baby is fine, Arthur!

18:48.629 --> 18:51.029
Forget about the baby!
I just wanna do my job!

18:51.599 --> 18:54.898
Jesus Christ, Ollie!
What the hell you screamin' about?

18:54.969 --> 18:58.268
Patty, was that...

19:09.583 --> 19:11.551
I'm working on that right now.
Don't worry.

19:11.619 --> 19:14.110
Just get there early
and deal with the menu. OK?

19:14.188 --> 19:17.624
Hey! Are you deaf?
The kid is cryin' up there.

19:17.758 --> 19:21.091
Can you deal with that? I'm doing
something important. OK? Thanks.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.220
What the hell could be more
important than your kid crying?

19:23.297 --> 19:25.788
I have a memorabilia donation
ceremony in the morning

19:25.866 --> 19:28.300
that my company is treating
like a royal wedding

19:28.369 --> 19:32.237
'cause apparently the client's the most
beloved American musician since Elvis.

19:32.306 --> 19:34.467
The kid's been screaming
for the last ten minutes.

19:34.541 --> 19:37.635
If it bothers you so much,
go up there and give her a bottle. OK?

19:37.711 --> 19:40.544
Sorry. It's a nightmare
trying to work at this house.

19:41.949 --> 19:44.247
Jesus! Let me call you back, OK?

19:45.219 --> 19:47.517
- What, Dad?
- Listen, kid.

19:47.588 --> 19:52.082
I lost a wife too, remember?
So I get how you're feelin'. But come on.

19:52.159 --> 19:54.992
You were married for what, 20 years?
I got about 20 minutes.

19:55.062 --> 19:57.895
So you don't “get”
how I'm feeling at all, OK?

19:57.965 --> 20:01.264
I'm sorry, Oliver, but that don't change
the fact that you're a goddamn father now

20:01.335 --> 20:03.735
and you haven't acted like it
since that kid got home from the hospital!

20:03.804 --> 20:08.138
I been calling in sick for a month to do
the things you're supposed to be doin'!

20:08.208 --> 20:11.609
Jesus Christ, if Gertie could see
the shit you've been pulling...

20:13.013 --> 20:17.143
Gertie doesn't see anything anymore,
Dad. She's dead.

20:17.918 --> 20:20.079
Yeah, she's dead.

20:23.257 --> 20:26.192
But you ain't.
And neither is that kid.

20:38.772 --> 20:40.967
Yeah. It's nothin'.

20:42.643 --> 20:45.373
All right, so I'm gonna do the kit.
It's almost finished.

20:45.446 --> 20:48.472
You can deal with the menu.
What time's Will getting there?

20:59.727 --> 21:02.355
Dad, the baby's up!

21:06.300 --> 21:08.825
Dad! The baby needs to be fed!

21:13.006 --> 21:14.337
Dad!

21:22.015 --> 21:24.006
What the hell...?!

21:26.153 --> 21:28.678
Are you nuts?
What, are you trying to get killed?!

21:28.756 --> 21:31.987
- What are you doing?
- Searching for Christ. What's it look like?

21:32.059 --> 21:34.857
It would have been nice if you'd told me
you were leaving the house!

21:34.928 --> 21:38.523
That way, I could've given you the baby
instead of driving all the way down here!

21:38.599 --> 21:42.228
- Now I'm gonna hit traffic!
- No, you ain't giving me the baby.

21:46.874 --> 21:49.035
Hey! Excuse me?

21:49.109 --> 21:51.202
I got uptown and downtown
to do this morning.

21:51.278 --> 21:55.146
- You're on your own with the kid today.
- What?! No!

21:55.215 --> 21:58.116
I have this press conference I have to do
this morning, Dad! You know that!

21:58.185 --> 22:02.087
- I got a job to do too.
- If I don't leave right now...

22:02.156 --> 22:04.249
- So leave!
- And do what with the baby?!

22:04.324 --> 22:07.020
- Take her with you!
- Goddamn it! I...

22:08.028 --> 22:11.020
Look, I know I haven't been
helping out that much with the baby...

22:11.098 --> 22:13.089
Listen to you, “Helping out
that much with the baby.”

22:13.167 --> 22:14.691
She's your daughter,
for Christ's sakes!

22:14.768 --> 22:19.501
- What am I supposed to do with her?!
- Try acting like her father, shithead!

22:20.974 --> 22:22.965
Goddamn it!

22:55.576 --> 22:57.066
Folks, I'm sorry.

22:58.679 --> 23:02.342
- Sorry. Steve.
- What the...?!

23:02.416 --> 23:05.476
- I ordered diapers. Did they get here yet?
- You mean baby diapers?

23:05.552 --> 23:07.884
Why didn't you start half an hour ago?
You shouldn't have waited for me!

23:07.955 --> 23:10.150
- We're waiting for Will.
- Will's not here?!

23:10.224 --> 23:12.692
- No.
- Are either of you guys Trinket?

23:12.759 --> 23:14.659
- Close enough. Where is he?
- We're not sure.

23:14.728 --> 23:17.458
Damn! That baby smells like shit.
You know that, right?

23:17.531 --> 23:19.294
It's a good thing
you finally showed up, man.

23:19.366 --> 23:22.665
- They're gettin' all rowdy out there.
- Oh, Mother of God!

23:22.736 --> 23:24.533
- What? Jesus...
- Ollie!

23:24.605 --> 23:28.234
Ollie, the guy from Rolling Stone...
Holy shit! What is that smell?

23:28.308 --> 23:31.505
Grow up, Susan! It's a dirty diaper.
What did the Rolling Stone guy say?

23:31.578 --> 23:33.569
If we don't start in five minutes,
they're leaving

23:33.647 --> 23:36.115
to go cover the Blues Traveler
signing at Tower.

23:36.183 --> 23:39.414
- Jesus Christ!
- Hey, you're doing that wrong.

23:39.486 --> 23:41.511
- What?
- You're doing that wrong.

23:41.588 --> 23:44.523
You're supposed to wipe front to back.
You're wiping back to front.

23:44.591 --> 23:47.924
You do that, you're just wiping
the poop into her...

23:47.995 --> 23:49.826
crevice.

23:50.497 --> 23:52.226
Get outta here! Beat it!

23:52.299 --> 23:54.665
Mark my words,
you're gonna give her the crotch-rot.

23:54.735 --> 23:56.828
- Would one of you do... You do this.
- Oh, not me. No.

23:56.904 --> 23:58.895
Will you do this
so I can go out there and calm them down?

23:58.972 --> 24:02.203
Why, because I'm a girl?
I've never even seen a naked baby. No!

24:02.276 --> 24:04.904
Fine. Thank you very much.
I'm gonna remember this.

24:04.978 --> 24:08.539
- How much of this am I supposed to use?
- Should I get that guy back?

24:08.615 --> 24:11.015
If it's for the smell,
I suggest you use a lot.

24:11.084 --> 24:15.578
You gotta turn... turn it.
You gotta turn the top!

24:15.656 --> 24:18.284
Oh! Direct it at the baby.

24:18.358 --> 24:22.795
Thank you! Go out there, please,
and tell them we're about to start!

24:27.768 --> 24:29.759
I'd say more.

24:34.841 --> 24:36.035
That's a lot.

24:39.012 --> 24:41.412
All right,
the Fresh Prince is almost here.

24:41.481 --> 24:44.575
Is that blow on your shirt?

24:44.651 --> 24:48.610
What do you think, Stretch?
This is show business, right?

24:48.689 --> 24:52.090
- That was a joke, people.
- Where's the Fresh Prince?

24:52.159 --> 24:54.491
The Fresh Prince is on his way.

24:54.561 --> 24:56.426
- It's crying. Will you take it?
- No! No.

24:56.496 --> 24:59.795
Is that Jazzy Jeff?

24:59.866 --> 25:02.027
This is bullshit!
Where's the Fresh Prince?

25:02.102 --> 25:04.798
Will someone please shut that girl up?

25:04.871 --> 25:07.669
Enough with the Romper Room, man!
Bring out the Fresh Prince!

25:07.741 --> 25:09.641
Fresh Prince! Fresh Prince!

25:10.711 --> 25:13.236
Please take her.

25:14.181 --> 25:15.739
I...

25:18.318 --> 25:22.721
Goddamn it! Christ!
Give her to me! Give me the baby.

25:33.767 --> 25:37.931
Would you people just shut the hell up
with the “Fresh Prince” already?!

25:38.005 --> 25:40.064
He's a two-bit TV actor...

25:40.140 --> 25:42.438
who won't be around any longer
than it takes for the ink to dry

25:42.509 --> 25:47.310
on the pages of the worthless rags
you jerk-offs write for!

25:50.984 --> 25:52.849
Shit.

25:55.322 --> 25:57.813

- That's a hell of a quote.

We'll be out of your hair
as soon as I get another job.

27:26.413 --> 27:29.211
I have some feelers out
to the other firms right now.

27:29.282 --> 27:32.342
As soon as this whole thing
blows over...

27:32.419 --> 27:37.083
It's OK to stay here as long as you need
to, till you get back on your feet.

27:37.157 --> 27:39.717
- I appreciate that.
- On one condition.

27:39.793 --> 27:44.287
- Here we go.
- You put the kid to bed every night.

27:44.364 --> 27:47.356
- That's it?
- For starters.

27:47.434 --> 27:50.528
And no whores.
I don't want no whores in my house.

27:51.271 --> 27:54.934
I'm not really a whoremonger, Dad.

27:55.008 --> 27:57.533
Here, the kid gets this.

27:57.611 --> 28:00.944
That's cute.
8:00, you both get a bottle.

28:01.014 --> 28:05.542
Just shut the hell up and go be a father,
would ya, please?

28:29.242 --> 28:31.233
No?

28:38.051 --> 28:42.613
Yeah, this is only temporary,
us... you know...

28:42.689 --> 28:45.317
living with your grandfather here.

28:47.027 --> 28:48.927
So...

28:50.497 --> 28:53.625
how about that Fresh Prince thing?

28:53.700 --> 28:55.930
It was quite a show.

28:56.570 --> 28:59.198
Your dad's one big horse's ass.

29:01.241 --> 29:04.233
Daddy's ex-bosses said
the guys who did PR for Hitler

29:04.311 --> 29:08.179
have a better chance of working in
this business again than Daddy does.

29:12.052 --> 29:14.384
So, OK...

29:15.822 --> 29:18.290
How're you doin'?

29:21.728 --> 29:25.960
Yeah... You know,
you kinda look like your mom.

29:26.032 --> 29:29.934
Like a squishier,
balder version of your mom.

29:35.809 --> 29:37.777
Man...

29:37.844 --> 29:41.177
I just wish you could've gotten
to meet your mom.

29:42.148 --> 29:47.051
I know she wanted to meet you...
in a big, bad way.

29:49.823 --> 29:52.087
In a big, bad way.

29:56.496 --> 30:01.126
Sometimes, Daddy wishes
he'd have died instead of Mommy.

30:02.002 --> 30:04.937
Because Mommy never would've...

30:05.005 --> 30:08.805
let work get in the way of...
getting to know you,

30:08.875 --> 30:13.608
like Daddy has for the last...
month or so.

30:16.683 --> 30:21.347
It's just that Daddy...
he didn't expect Mommy...

30:22.389 --> 30:24.914
to leave the way she did.

30:27.761 --> 30:33.165
It's just really hard on Daddy, who's been
trying to fill up his days with work,

30:33.233 --> 30:38.535
so he wouldn't have to think about
Mommy never being around again.

30:39.539 --> 30:42.440
I just loved your mom so much.

30:42.509 --> 30:44.500
You know?

30:45.478 --> 30:47.912
She really lit my world on fire.

30:50.450 --> 30:52.611
When that happens...

30:53.620 --> 30:59.581
you kinda think it'll go on like that
until one of you dies. You know?

30:59.659 --> 31:02.753
You just don't expect...

31:02.829 --> 31:06.094
I miss her so much. So, so much.

31:12.739 --> 31:17.472
And you're a little piece of Mommy. And
that makes you really special to Daddy.

31:30.490 --> 31:32.481
Just don't go anywhere.

31:32.559 --> 31:36.051
'Cause you're the next best thing
to Mommy, and I love you so much.

31:36.129 --> 31:38.393
And I'll always be here for you.

31:38.465 --> 31:41.662
And I'm sorry about
the way I've been acting.

31:41.735 --> 31:46.172
I promise you...
I'll be better now.

31:46.239 --> 31:49.572
I'm gonna be the best daddy
in the world.

31:49.642 --> 31:54.636
'Cause that's what Mommy wanted.
And that's what you deserve.

31:56.182 --> 31:58.616
And that's all I am now.

31:59.819 --> 32:02.287
I'm just your dad.

32:20.774 --> 32:23.902
Your dad likes to run off at the mouth
sometimes, I know.

32:28.415 --> 32:31.043
Your mother wasn't a fan, either.

32:32.886 --> 32:36.515
You wanna see a picture
of your mom? I have one.

32:38.258 --> 32:42.160
This was your mommy.
She was really pretty.

32:42.762 --> 32:45.253
OK. You can keep it.

32:46.900 --> 32:49.494
Daddy's got a bunch.

32:50.870 --> 32:53.361
There you go.

33:03.850 --> 33:06.580
Goodnight, Gertie.

33:31.811 --> 33:34.177
♪ Worlds...

33:35.448 --> 33:38.178
♪ They rise and fall

33:40.053 --> 33:40.815
Gertie!

33:40.887 --> 33:42.980
♪ Within her eyes

33:44.157 --> 33:46.751
Your chariot awaits, Princess.

33:46.826 --> 33:48.623
Let's go!

33:50.396 --> 33:53.331
We gotta go! Argh!

33:53.399 --> 33:55.697
♪ To fly in the sky

33:55.768 --> 33:57.668
- How was school, good?
- Mm-hm.

33:57.737 --> 33:59.329
- You have a nice time?
- Yep.

33:59.405 --> 34:02.238
Remember to put your seat belt on?
Know where to find it?

34:02.308 --> 34:02.797
Yep.

34:02.876 --> 34:08.337
Lock and load.
Comin' around. Get ready.

34:17.290 --> 34:20.123
- Ready?
- Punch it, Chewy!

34:23.196 --> 34:25.790
- Can we go see Cats?
- Absolutely not.

34:25.864 --> 34:26.922
Why?

34:27.000 --> 34:29.434
Cats was the second-worst thing
that ever happened to New York City.

34:29.502 --> 34:33.302
- Besides, Cats closed three years ago.
- We never do anything cool.

34:33.373 --> 34:37.002
You're ridin' in the Batmobile,
aren't ya? How cool is that?

34:37.076 --> 34:38.600
Oh, my God.

34:38.678 --> 34:41.476
Look, no one's more depressed than me
that driving the street sweeper

34:41.547 --> 34:43.880
is considered the height
of excitement in my life.

34:43.949 --> 34:45.781
I used to live in New York City.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.842
I could've gone to see Cats
three times a day.

34:47.920 --> 34:51.789
- It's not like I ever ask for anything.
- Oh-ho-ho!

34:51.858 --> 34:54.121
“And the Oscar goes to Gertie Trinke,

34:54.194 --> 34:57.357
for her performance in
Laying It On Thick For My Old Man.”

34:59.032 --> 35:01.000
What is it with you and Cats
all of a sudden?

35:01.067 --> 35:03.968
I wanna sing a Cats song
in the big show, like everybody else.

35:04.037 --> 35:06.835
- What big show?
- There's gonna be this big show at school.

35:06.906 --> 35:10.103
All the people have to sing a song
with people from their family.

35:10.176 --> 35:14.169
- Are you inviting me to this big show?
- Duh! Yeah, you and Pop too.

35:14.247 --> 35:17.683
Oh-ho! I'm sure that'll go over
huge with your pop.

35:17.750 --> 35:19.911
Can Uncle Greenie and Uncle Block
be in it too?

35:19.986 --> 35:23.387
Those men are not your uncles.
They're barely even your peers.

35:23.456 --> 35:24.514
Pee-ers?

35:24.591 --> 35:28.254
- When is this big show?
- Right before Thanksgiving break.

35:28.328 --> 35:30.091
Does it have to be something
from the Bible?

35:30.163 --> 35:32.723
I don't think so.
Is Cats in the Bible?

35:32.799 --> 35:35.427
The Satanic Bible, yes.

35:44.444 --> 35:47.106
- What?
- When you taking her to see the cats?

35:47.180 --> 35:49.546
Jesus, you too?

35:49.616 --> 35:51.379
Gertie!

35:53.019 --> 35:55.112
Do you even know what Cats is, Dad?

35:55.188 --> 35:59.022
- What, I don't read the papers?
- You don't read that paper.

35:59.092 --> 36:00.923
What are you doing with
a New York Times?

36:00.994 --> 36:02.518
They ran out of the Ledger.

36:02.595 --> 36:05.086
They don't have the Jumble
in the Times, Dad.

36:05.164 --> 36:07.462
Shit.

36:08.167 --> 36:10.226
- Where were you?
- I was in the bathroom.

36:10.303 --> 36:13.636
- Why didn't I hear the toilet flush?
- Oh. I forgot.

36:13.706 --> 36:16.470
OK, march your butt back upstairs
and flush that toilet.

36:16.542 --> 36:18.305
And when I say no about something,

36:18.378 --> 36:20.869
like, I don't know, Cats, maybe,
I mean no.

36:20.947 --> 36:22.209
OK?

36:22.282 --> 36:26.810
- Pop, you were supposed to be subtle!
- Why do you teach her words like that?

36:26.886 --> 36:29.377
You're gonna have to mow the park
for me tomorrow. I can't do it.

36:29.455 --> 36:32.424
- Why the hell not?
- I have an appointment in the city at 11:00.

36:32.492 --> 36:34.983
Jesus, kid,
why do you keep doin' it to yourself?

36:35.061 --> 36:37.120
How many of these interviews
you gotta go on

36:37.196 --> 36:38.595
before you get it through
your thick head

36:38.665 --> 36:40.997
they don't want you
in that business anymore?

36:41.067 --> 36:43.831
For Christ's sakes, you made fun
of that Prince Charles guy.

36:43.903 --> 36:45.894
Thank you.

36:45.972 --> 36:49.533
First of all, Dad,
I didn't “make fun” of anybody.

36:49.609 --> 36:53.010
I made one remark about Will Smith,
the Fresh Prince.

36:53.079 --> 36:55.172
Sooner or later,
everyone's gonna forget about that

36:55.248 --> 36:57.273
and I'm gonna go back to doing
what I'm really good at,

36:57.350 --> 37:00.945
instead of sweeping streets
and plowing snow and picking up garbage.

37:01.020 --> 37:02.351
OK?

37:02.422 --> 37:07.086
If you're going into the city anyway,
at least take the kid to see the cats.

37:08.861 --> 37:10.419
Oh, God...

37:10.496 --> 37:13.363
I'll tell you what,
since there is no more Cats,

37:13.433 --> 37:18.871
Gertie, why don't you come over here and
pick out another play that you wanna see?

37:18.938 --> 37:22.601
Look through here.
Anything you want. Go nuts.

37:22.675 --> 37:26.441
- Cats is a show?
- Yeah, you read the papers.

37:28.848 --> 37:30.679
You think you're slick,
don't ya, young lady?

37:30.750 --> 37:33.048
Next time you're lookin'
for a partner in crime,

37:33.119 --> 37:35.383
you're gonna have to aim higher
than your grandfather.

37:35.455 --> 37:38.947
- He's soft in the head.
- I heard that!

37:41.928 --> 37:44.192
Here. Can we go see this show?

37:44.263 --> 37:47.232
Sweeney Todd? Do you know
that this has a lot of singing?

37:47.300 --> 37:50.292
- It's still a play.
- OK. I'm just checking.

37:50.370 --> 37:53.703
Your dad one time lost a bet
with someone at his work,

37:53.773 --> 37:57.573
and he had to go see a singing play,
done by people on roller skates.

37:57.643 --> 38:00.578
- Cool!
- Your dad didn't think so.

38:00.880 --> 38:02.871
I handled primarily
recording artists

38:03.116 --> 38:06.882
but when I initially trained,
I trained in film PR, so I can do that too.

38:07.920 --> 38:13.153
I... took the last six or seven years off.
I was raising my daughter in New Jersey.

38:13.226 --> 38:17.595
But I kept abreast, so...
I'm pretty comfortable jumping back in.

38:17.663 --> 38:20.860
What else can I tell you guys?

38:20.933 --> 38:23.595
That's it.
I can start, you know, right away.

38:27.607 --> 38:31.168
You guys all right?

38:34.013 --> 38:38.677
Are you the Ollie Trinke? The one
who used to work at Mandell Kirschner?

38:40.553 --> 38:41.076
Yeah.

38:41.154 --> 38:44.954
- Son of a bitch!
- Yes! I told you, Reynolds! Pay up!

38:45.024 --> 38:47.424
- I got it.
- Am I missin' somethin'?

38:47.493 --> 38:50.326
Nah, nah, he just bet me
you were the Ollie Trinke,

38:50.396 --> 38:52.023
the one who pulled “The Fresh Prince”.

38:52.098 --> 38:54.362
- They named it?
- Of course!

38:54.434 --> 38:56.766
Are you kidding?
You're a legend, man!

38:56.836 --> 38:59.634
You did what every flack
only dreams about doing!

38:59.705 --> 39:01.673
- Which was what?
- You went apeshit!

39:01.741 --> 39:03.709
You trashed your client
back to the Stone Age.

39:03.776 --> 39:06.074
- Yeah.
- We bow to you, man.

39:06.145 --> 39:08.545
- You're like a god around here.
- Yep, exactly.

39:08.614 --> 39:11.981
- God enough to get a job?
- No.

39:12.051 --> 39:15.748
- What, are you insane?
- No chance, Trinke!

39:17.190 --> 39:20.353
- Pop, I'm home!
- Yeah, like I give a shit.

39:20.426 --> 39:22.223
You know, thanks a lot, Pop!

39:30.069 --> 39:33.129
- That's what it looks like?
- I guess.

39:33.206 --> 39:36.334
- What does yours look like?
- Not like that.

39:36.409 --> 39:38.172
Yeah? Let me see.

39:38.244 --> 39:40.235
All right.

39:41.414 --> 39:44.747
Gertie!
It's time for Bryan to go home.

39:54.894 --> 39:56.725
OK...

40:03.703 --> 40:06.672
What are your intentions?

40:06.739 --> 40:09.799
What are your intentions
with my daughter?

40:09.876 --> 40:13.835
- Do you plan on marrying her?
- I don't know.

40:13.913 --> 40:17.679
Well, only married boys and girls...

40:17.750 --> 40:20.150
show each other their...

40:20.219 --> 40:22.779
their, you know...

40:22.855 --> 40:25.221
parts.

40:25.291 --> 40:26.315
OK?

40:28.594 --> 40:33.293
OK, Bryan, you can go now.
If you come back, come back with a ring.

40:33.366 --> 40:35.197
Yes, Mr. Trinke.

40:35.268 --> 40:37.031
- Bye, Gertie.
- Bye.

40:37.103 --> 40:39.230
Goodbye, Bryan.

40:41.807 --> 40:43.434
OK.

40:44.377 --> 40:46.937
Do you have any...

40:48.147 --> 40:51.742
questions about what you...

40:51.817 --> 40:53.307
you know...

40:55.054 --> 40:57.921
you know, whatever, saw?

41:02.495 --> 41:04.690
Do you have what Bryan has?

41:08.801 --> 41:13.204
Yes, I have one... too.

41:15.775 --> 41:18.005
Is yours as big as his?

41:20.980 --> 41:23.039
Sadly, yes.

41:23.616 --> 41:26.278
- Can we rent a movie?
- Yes.

41:28.921 --> 41:32.914
- So they wouldn't give you a job?
- No. But apparently, Daddy's a legend.

41:32.992 --> 41:36.018
You don't need that job anyway.
You already got a job.

41:36.095 --> 41:39.360
Yes, well,
Daddy used to have a job

41:39.432 --> 41:41.730
where a nightly shower was an option,
not a necessity.

41:41.801 --> 41:43.996
- You know what job you should do?
- What's that?

41:44.070 --> 41:46.766
You should be a dance teacher,
like Johnny in Dirty Dancing.

41:46.839 --> 41:51.242
I should? Should I say,
“Nobody puts Baby in a corner”?

41:51.310 --> 41:53.175
Oh, can we rent
Dirty Dancing again?

41:53.245 --> 41:57.147
Dirty Dancing ranks one notch
below Cats in my book.

41:57.216 --> 41:59.741
Can you pick out something else?

42:01.721 --> 42:03.882
Can we rent this?

42:03.956 --> 42:07.653
Absolutely not. Go pick out something
from the children's section.

42:07.727 --> 42:11.493
- All those movies suck.
- Watch your language.

42:39.458 --> 42:41.926
Nah, that's...

42:41.994 --> 42:44.519
No, I guess that's it.
Yep, yep, that's it.

42:46.065 --> 42:49.193
I'll just take this
and whatever the kid's getting.

42:49.268 --> 42:52.795
Just go ahead and put it in the bag.
I'm all set.

42:52.872 --> 42:54.863
It's good.

42:57.209 --> 43:00.872
“Bi-Bi Guys, featuring Curious Jordie”?

43:02.782 --> 43:06.479
Interesting choice. Does the wife know
you're looking into your options?

43:06.552 --> 43:08.679
It's... I got the...

43:09.655 --> 43:11.885
- I got the wrong box by accident.
- Oh, right.

43:11.957 --> 43:15.120
Would you mind...
exchanging that for me for something...

43:15.194 --> 43:17.890
anything you can get your hands on
that's, you know...

43:17.963 --> 43:21.660
- So, then you want something...
- ...that's non-bi.

43:27.406 --> 43:29.203
Can I have your
membership card, please?

43:29.275 --> 43:31.072
Yeah, sure.

43:31.143 --> 43:34.579
Do you mind if I asked you a few questions
about your renting practices?

43:34.647 --> 43:36.581
Sure.

43:36.649 --> 43:38.412
Really?

43:38.484 --> 43:43.285
Do you always rent adult titles with your
daughter in tow, or is this the first time?

43:43.355 --> 43:44.253
Excuse me?

43:44.323 --> 43:47.656
When you rent porn, do you
usually do it with family around,

43:47.727 --> 43:50.525
or is this like a, you know,
special occasion?

43:51.731 --> 43:56.327
- Do I have to answer this?
- I'm a grad student, writing a thesis paper.

43:56.402 --> 44:01.237
“A Bird in the Hand: The Family Man
and the Pornographic Fixation”.

44:02.875 --> 44:05.207
OK. I would rather not take part.

44:05.277 --> 44:06.642
Really?

44:06.712 --> 44:09.909
Frank, is Bi-Bi Guys
a one or a two-night rental?

44:09.982 --> 44:14.009
- What are you getting, Daddy?
- Yeah, Daddy. Let's just take a look...

44:14.086 --> 44:16.054
Let's not, OK?

44:19.358 --> 44:23.317
Would you mind not asking me those
questions when my daughter's with me?

44:23.395 --> 44:25.920
How about when you bring these back?

44:25.998 --> 44:27.932
That's... Yeah.

44:28.000 --> 44:33.199
In an effort to get honest feedback,
leave the kid and the wife at home.

44:33.272 --> 44:36.537
My mom's dead.
She died when I was born.

44:36.609 --> 44:38.440
Oh, Jesus.

44:39.145 --> 44:41.443
Man, I'm sorry. I didn't...

44:41.514 --> 44:43.948
No, you didn't.

44:46.685 --> 44:48.414
Let's go.

44:50.456 --> 44:52.651
I'm sorry.

44:52.725 --> 44:54.750
Do I have to?

44:54.827 --> 44:59.958
Major Damage didn't have to go to bed
when he fought the Tiki Terrors!

45:00.032 --> 45:02.000
- Melvin!
- And do they...

45:02.067 --> 45:03.898
I'll get it.

45:03.969 --> 45:07.302
You will not. You're not even
supposed to be up this late.

45:07.373 --> 45:09.637
Watch your video.

45:09.708 --> 45:12.506
- But, Mom!
- Say, “OK, Mom.”

45:12.578 --> 45:15.240
Say, “OK, Mom.”

45:16.115 --> 45:17.480
Hi.

45:17.550 --> 45:19.780
Hey! You're the lady
from the video store.

45:20.719 --> 45:25.452
Let's not use that term too loosely, OK?
Go back and watch your video.

45:27.893 --> 45:29.121
Yes?

45:29.195 --> 45:31.186
I just wanted to come here

45:31.263 --> 45:35.029
and tell you that I'm really sorry
about earlier tonight.

45:35.100 --> 45:38.866
I feel like shit about what I said
and your daughter and everything.

45:38.938 --> 45:41.907
Well... you should.

45:41.974 --> 45:44.169
You know that kid was crying
in the car the whole way home?

45:44.243 --> 45:46.973
- Oh, no...
- No, I wasn't.

45:47.513 --> 45:51.176
- Get back inside and watch your video!
- Nice! Real nice.

45:51.250 --> 45:54.947
See, now you have to let me
interview you for my paper.

45:55.020 --> 45:56.544
Is that why you're here?

45:56.622 --> 45:59.557
I just think you'd make one hell of
an interesting case study.

45:59.625 --> 46:03.891
The sympathetic widower who doesn't have
time to date 'cause he's raising a kid,

46:03.963 --> 46:07.296
so he rents porn instead. I mean,
I think that's very interesting stuff.

46:07.366 --> 46:09.857
Jesus Christ!
You've got some nerve, lady.

46:09.935 --> 46:13.302
And besides,
I'd really like to make it up to you.

46:13.372 --> 46:16.364
For what I said,
and for embarrassing you before that.

46:16.442 --> 46:19.468
You're really having a banner evening.
You're batting a thousand tonight.

46:19.545 --> 46:22.981
You're Ollie, right?
I'm Maya Harding.

46:25.918 --> 46:27.909
“Hi, Maya. Nice to meet you.”

46:27.987 --> 46:28.976
Hi.

46:29.054 --> 46:31.716
Come on, why don't you let me
take you out one day this week?

46:31.790 --> 46:35.521
You do eat lunch when you're not
knee-deep in adult movies, right?

46:36.528 --> 46:39.622
I appreciate it, but...
no thanks.

46:39.698 --> 46:42.690
Ollie, come on,
you're ruining my karma level here.

46:42.768 --> 46:45.362
What, buying me one lunch
is gonna square you with Krishna?

46:45.437 --> 46:46.927
Hare Hare!

46:49.942 --> 46:52.240
Is Monday OK? Sound good?

46:52.311 --> 46:57.305
I mean, I was thinking nothing fancy.
I was thinking maybe, like, the diner.

46:57.383 --> 47:00.546
- Around noon?
- No!

47:02.021 --> 47:03.886
Noon it is!

47:03.956 --> 47:05.685
Oh...

47:05.758 --> 47:07.783
See you there. Bye!

47:10.529 --> 47:12.656
An incredibly strange woman.

47:22.541 --> 47:25.237
I did not hear the toilet flush.

47:30.249 --> 47:31.682
Thank you.

47:35.587 --> 47:38.852
- Can we get popcorn?
- This isn't the movies, sweetheart.

47:38.924 --> 47:44.260
They don't sell popcorn here.
This is Broadway. This is class.

47:44.330 --> 47:46.764
♪ And if you're beautiful

47:46.832 --> 47:47.821

48:15.427 --> 48:19.261
OK. You see that floor.
Now look three windows in from the right.

48:19.331 --> 48:23.199
See that window? That's where we
used to live before we lived with Pop.

48:23.268 --> 48:25.862
We'd still live there
if we lived in the city.

48:25.938 --> 48:28.873
- If Mommy was still alive?
- Yep.

48:29.775 --> 48:31.299
- Dad...
- Yes?

48:31.377 --> 48:33.845
Do you miss Mommy?

48:33.912 --> 48:36.710
I do. Every day.

48:37.449 --> 48:40.976
- What was she like?
- I've told you a million times.

48:41.053 --> 48:44.580
- I know, but I forget.
- No, I don't think you forget.

48:44.656 --> 48:47.454
I think you just like to hear me tell you.
Which is OK. It's all right.

48:47.526 --> 48:49.187
You can ask about your mommy
as much as you want.

48:49.261 --> 48:50.785
So tell me already.

48:50.863 --> 48:53.832
Well, she was pushy,
like you were right there.

48:53.899 --> 48:57.892
She was beautiful,
like you are right now.

48:57.970 --> 49:01.531
And she was... smart...

49:02.674 --> 49:05.507
and strong,
like you'll grow up to be one day.

49:05.577 --> 49:06.874
I'm smart now.

49:06.945 --> 49:09.470
I know. I wasn't impugning
your intelligence or anything.

49:09.548 --> 49:11.539
What's “impugning” mean?

49:11.617 --> 49:13.744
Oh, not so smart now, are you?

49:13.819 --> 49:16.447
- That's a big word.
- Yes, you're right, it is.

49:16.522 --> 49:19.150
Let's see.
To impugn means to criticize.

49:19.224 --> 49:23.558
So... Pop's always impugning you, right?

49:24.063 --> 49:25.553
Well, he thinks he is.

49:25.631 --> 49:27.997
But he's just talking
to make sure he's still alive.

49:28.067 --> 49:30.968
Pop is a very, very old man.

49:32.871 --> 49:34.862
What do you think?
You like the city?

49:35.040 --> 49:37.770
It's OK.
But I like Highlands better.

49:37.843 --> 49:39.435
- You do?
- Yeah.

49:39.511 --> 49:43.277
My school's there, and my friends...
And we can rent movies there.

49:43.348 --> 49:46.943
Well, if memory serves,
you can rent movies here too.

49:47.019 --> 49:50.113
Yeah, but not from that pretty lady
at the video store.

49:50.189 --> 49:52.555
- Oh, you think she's pretty, do you?
- Don't you?

49:52.624 --> 49:55.422
Isn't that why
you're taking her on a date?

49:55.494 --> 49:59.760
It's not a date.
The only girl I take on dates is you, OK?

49:59.832 --> 50:01.299
This is a date.
We're on a date.

50:01.366 --> 50:03.129
- We are?
- Mm-hm.

50:03.202 --> 50:06.467
- It doesn't feel like a date.
- It doesn't?

50:06.538 --> 50:09.336
Well, I can fix that.

50:11.276 --> 50:12.106
Sir!

50:30.863 --> 50:34.765
How often do you rent adult movies?

50:35.934 --> 50:39.301
- Do I really have to do this?
- You have nothing to be ashamed about.

50:39.371 --> 50:43.000
Interest in adult film can be healthy,
as long as it's not habitual.

50:43.075 --> 50:47.842
- So come on, how often?
- Three or four times a week.

50:48.614 --> 50:51.082
OK, maybe I was wrong.
You should be ashamed.

50:51.150 --> 50:53.516
You have a real talent
for making the subject feel open

50:53.585 --> 50:55.678
and comfortable
in a safe environment.

50:55.754 --> 50:58.848
So you're renting it presumably
to masturbate to, right?

50:58.924 --> 51:01.415
- Good God!
- Come on, don't be such a tight-ass.

51:01.493 --> 51:02.585
We're all adults here.

51:02.661 --> 51:04.458
I know I'm an adult.
How old are you, exactly?

51:04.530 --> 51:06.521
- I'll be 26 in March.
- 26?

51:06.598 --> 51:09.692
You still haven't learned some things
aren't polite to talk about in public?

51:09.768 --> 51:13.363
If it makes you feel any better,
I do it, like, twice a day.

51:13.772 --> 51:17.299
- Good God!
- What can I tell ya? I get bored easily.

51:17.376 --> 51:19.844
You're gonna get
carpal tunnel syndrome.

51:19.912 --> 51:23.439
Don't get all judgmental with me.
You're no slouch yourself.

51:23.515 --> 51:26.348
- Well, no, I...
- I just have a healthy sexual appetite.

51:26.418 --> 51:28.682
Why don't you go out
and get yourself a boyfriend?

51:28.754 --> 51:30.984
Why don't you just go out
and get yourself a girlfriend?

51:31.056 --> 51:33.149
I work all day,
I hang out with my kid all night.

51:33.225 --> 51:35.489
So you'd rather hang out with your kid
than get laid?

51:35.561 --> 51:40.555
- Yeah.
- Aw... that's kinda sweet.

51:41.700 --> 51:44.328
I'm kinda crushin' on
you right now, Trinke.

51:44.403 --> 51:46.564
OK. Can I go home now?

51:46.638 --> 51:49.505
No.
When was the last time you had sex?

51:50.909 --> 51:53.810
I would rather not
disclose that information.

51:53.879 --> 51:55.540
Oh, come on,
don't clam up on me now.

51:55.614 --> 51:57.809
You're gonna remain anonymous
in my paper.

51:57.883 --> 52:01.182
Ha! Anonymity doesn't concern me.
Embarrassment does.

52:01.253 --> 52:04.654
- Why would you be embarrassed?
- Because it's been a long time.

52:04.723 --> 52:08.056
- How long?
- A long time.

52:08.126 --> 52:11.061
Come on, champ. Own it.
Just put it out there.

52:11.129 --> 52:13.757
I swear I won't make
any editorial cracks about it.

52:13.832 --> 52:16.300
Not in front of you, at least.

52:19.438 --> 52:23.499
- Seven years.
- Seven years?

52:23.575 --> 52:26.305
Since my wife died, yeah.

52:27.379 --> 52:31.281
You know, a dumbfounded,
mouth-agape look of shock

52:31.350 --> 52:34.251
might be construed by some
as an editorial crack too.

52:34.653 --> 52:37.213
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK. It's fine.

52:37.289 --> 52:40.656
No, it's not.
I mean, it's not at all.

52:40.726 --> 52:44.890
With all due respect to your wife,
you've gotta get back on the horse, man.

52:44.963 --> 52:47.898
- No, I don't, actually.
- Yes, you do.

52:47.966 --> 52:51.265
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you... Get up.

52:51.336 --> 52:54.464
- Are we done?
- With this, for now. But come with me.

52:54.539 --> 52:56.473
Lord have mercy.

52:58.043 --> 53:00.102
- Where are we going?
- To your place.

53:00.178 --> 53:02.669
We're gonna have some sex.

53:04.916 --> 53:09.979
- What, did you forget something?
- No. Look, I appreciate the offer.

53:10.889 --> 53:14.484
I'm very flattered.
But I can't do this.

53:15.160 --> 53:17.060
What's the matter?
Don't you think I'm cute?

53:17.129 --> 53:19.597
- Of course I think you're cute.
- Well, then?

53:19.665 --> 53:22.634
Look, I'm not just celibate
because of my daughter.

53:22.701 --> 53:24.896
There are a lot of emotional
issues in it too.

53:24.970 --> 53:29.600
I mean, my wife may be dead.
I'm still very much in love with her.

53:29.675 --> 53:32.803
Hey, I respect that. I'm not telling you
to fall in love with me here,

53:32.878 --> 53:34.903
and I'm not trying to replace your wife.

53:34.980 --> 53:39.542
I'm just talking about two consenting
adults having some casual sex.

53:39.618 --> 53:44.180
Probably some really short casual sex,
with you being a little out of practice.

53:44.256 --> 53:47.191
- I can't do it, I'm sorry.
- What are you, a monk?

53:47.259 --> 53:49.955
God!
Let's look at this logically, OK?

53:50.028 --> 53:53.589
- You rent porn and touch yourself, right?
- Would you lower your voice?

53:53.665 --> 53:56.828
If you're not sweating how your wife
would feel about you and porn,

53:56.902 --> 54:01.100
then you shouldn't sweat what
I'm proposing 'cause it's the same thing.

54:01.173 --> 54:05.166
Only somebody else is doing the touching
and you're saving a $2 rental fee.

54:06.611 --> 54:11.105
Come on, stud.
Man cannot live on porn alone.

54:28.800 --> 54:30.529
Oh, God...

54:31.570 --> 54:33.834
I'm home!

54:33.905 --> 54:34.997
Pop?!

54:35.073 --> 54:39.373
- Oh, my God... What do I do?
- Get in the bathroom!

54:57.262 --> 55:00.857
- Pop?
- No, honey, it's me.

55:00.932 --> 55:03.924
Daddy? Why aren't you at work?

55:05.270 --> 55:08.831
Because I had to come home and do...
I had to...

55:08.907 --> 55:11.171
come home and take a shower.

55:12.177 --> 55:15.271
- Can we rent a movie?
- Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

55:15.347 --> 55:18.544
As soon as I get done up here
and dry off, I'll come down.

55:18.617 --> 55:20.414
OK.

55:22.821 --> 55:24.550
Oh, my God. That was so close.

55:24.623 --> 55:26.921
What do we do now? I'm wet.

55:33.999 --> 55:36.229
Sorry, Dad, I forgot again.

55:48.513 --> 55:50.037
Hi, honey.

55:50.115 --> 55:53.380
You remember Maya.
From the video store.

56:05.864 --> 56:09.766
- What are your intentions?
- Excuse me?

56:09.835 --> 56:11.894
What are your intentions
with my father?

56:11.970 --> 56:13.961
Like, do you plan on marrying him?

56:14.406 --> 56:16.169
I don't...

56:16.241 --> 56:20.143
Because I was taught that only married
girls show their girl parts to boys.

56:20.212 --> 56:25.275
- Right, Daddy?
- Right. Yes.

56:25.684 --> 56:27.413
Mm-hm.

56:27.486 --> 56:30.512
Can we rent all the movies we want
for free?

56:31.156 --> 56:32.145
What?

56:32.224 --> 56:34.749
Can we rent all the movies we want
for free?

56:34.826 --> 56:37.852
Yes! Yes, yes.
For God's sake, yes.

56:37.929 --> 56:42.229
If it means we're not, you know,
that we're not in trouble anymore.

56:42.300 --> 56:43.699
And... Right, Maya? Yes!

56:43.768 --> 56:45.963
Whatever you want.
It's on the house.

56:46.037 --> 56:48.835
Even Dirty Dancing?

56:54.312 --> 56:55.006
Yeah.

56:55.080 --> 56:57.776
And we can do Sweeney Todd
for the show at school?

56:57.849 --> 56:58.816
What?

56:58.884 --> 57:00.977
We can do Sweeney Todd
for the show at school?

57:01.052 --> 57:04.715
- No, honey, that's too grown-up.
- Really?

57:05.724 --> 57:09.421
Oh man, what am I gonna tell Pop
about you guys?

57:13.798 --> 57:16.494
Fine. We can do Sweeney Todd
for the show at school.

57:16.568 --> 57:18.399
OK!

57:19.070 --> 57:21.971
Would you shut the hell up already?
Christ, Greenie, you're always...

57:22.040 --> 57:23.473
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh!

57:23.542 --> 57:28.639
Christ Almighty.
You wearin' a... wearin' a towel?

57:30.148 --> 57:32.139
Just as long as you didn't do it
on my bed.

57:32.250 --> 57:36.653
Oh, Jesus Christ, it was one time in
high school! You wanna let it go already?

57:36.721 --> 57:40.851
I banged a broad
in my parents' bed once. It was nice.

57:41.593 --> 57:45.757
Terrific. Just so you know,
we didn't “bang”.

57:45.830 --> 57:47.821
- What, did ya get to third base?
- No!

57:47.899 --> 57:50.026
Not that it's any of your business,
but we didn't do anything.

57:50.101 --> 57:52.592
We lost our heads for a second,
then cooler heads prevailed

57:52.671 --> 57:55.231
and we stopped before we
did anything we'd both regret.

57:55.307 --> 57:58.105
- The kid busted in on 'em.
- Oh.

57:58.176 --> 58:00.610
Let's talk about something else
for a second, like this water main.

58:00.679 --> 58:02.977
- How bad is it?
- Definitely needs to be replaced.

58:03.048 --> 58:05.949
Jesus Christ. If we gotta shut down
Bay Avenue for that,

58:06.017 --> 58:08.008
this town is gonna throw a shit fit.

58:08.086 --> 58:09.314
I'm sure.

58:09.387 --> 58:13.323
Hey, kid, you haven't had to inconvenience
the taxpayers on the job yet.

58:13.391 --> 58:16.292
They get like animals.
Remember back in '88?

58:16.361 --> 58:17.794
South Peak Street.

58:17.862 --> 58:21.263
Holy shit, I thought they were gonna
crucify us upside down.

58:21.333 --> 58:25.736
- Like St Peter.
- Who are you, the Holy Father?

58:25.804 --> 58:29.433
Everybody knows I meant St Peter.
You don't have to explain my shit.

58:29.507 --> 58:30.872
I'm just saying...

58:30.942 --> 58:33.069
When I was down there,
how many cars did you wave around?

58:33.144 --> 58:34.133
Three or four.

58:34.212 --> 58:37.807
Three or four cars
for the whole half hour I was down there?

58:37.882 --> 58:39.110
Well, it was rush hour.

58:39.184 --> 58:42.517
Yeah, I don't think the legion of commuters
in the Highlands of New Jersey

58:42.587 --> 58:47.615
are gonna object to us closing down a
small portion of Bay Avenue for a few days.

58:47.692 --> 58:50.957
One at a time, please! One at a time!

58:52.731 --> 58:55.757
- We're doing the best we can.
- You were saying?

58:55.834 --> 59:00.294
Why doesn't somebody just go up there
and explain to them what's happening?

59:00.372 --> 59:02.932
Why don't you do it, Daddy?
Wasn't that your old job?

59:03.008 --> 59:06.409
Making people like singers
by saying nice things about 'em?

59:07.145 --> 59:10.842
- Yes, baby, but...
- No, the kid's got a point there.

59:10.915 --> 59:12.974
As a guy who used to
sling bullshit for a living,

59:13.051 --> 59:15.485
I nominate you to go up there
and say something.

59:15.553 --> 59:17.077
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah.

59:17.155 --> 59:19.953
- It can't hurt.
- Go ahead.

59:22.127 --> 59:24.357
Thanks, Pop.

59:26.097 --> 59:28.190
Control yourselves!

59:29.534 --> 59:31.525
He's goin' up there.

59:34.739 --> 59:38.038
Folks, one second.
Please. Folks.

59:38.109 --> 59:42.239
My name's Oliver Trinke
and I'm with the borough.

59:42.313 --> 59:45.282
So I guess that makes me
the least popular guy in the room.

59:51.856 --> 59:54.484
I want to assure you that...

59:54.559 --> 59:58.723
this Bay Avenue job will be
a very minimal inconvenience.

59:58.797 --> 01:00:00.788
It'll only take three days at the most.

01:00:00.865 --> 01:00:03.095
Bullshit! Bullshit!

01:00:11.976 --> 01:00:15.673
Folks, a little decorum!
A little decorum!

01:00:27.559 --> 01:00:29.322
Folks, one second.

01:00:29.394 --> 01:00:33.160
I just have one more thing
that I just want to add.

01:00:42.874 --> 01:00:45.968
I live in this town. I see you guys
headin' to work every day.

01:01:12.537 --> 01:01:14.061
I'm telling you,
it was amazing!

01:01:14.139 --> 01:01:19.270
And I get up there and I weave this
web of bullshit so profoundly mesmerizing,

01:01:19.344 --> 01:01:22.780
- I turn the entire place around!
- You silver-tongued devil, you.

01:01:22.847 --> 01:01:26.749
Everything I was saying
was just right on the money, you know?

01:01:26.818 --> 01:01:30.652
Maybe that's 'cause you weren't actually
slinging as much bullshit as you thought.

01:01:30.722 --> 01:01:33.987
“Get out there and play in the dirt”?
I mean, what... I made that up!

01:01:34.058 --> 01:01:36.754
Sounds pretty good to me.
Hey, Gert.

01:01:36.828 --> 01:01:41.128
The sad thing is, I had a greater sense of
accomplishment from the water-main thing

01:01:41.199 --> 01:01:43.190
than anything else I've done
in the past seven years.

01:01:43.268 --> 01:01:46.260
I get it. I mean, you set out
to do something and you did it.

01:01:46.337 --> 01:01:48.931
So you feel drunk with power now.
Makes sense.

01:01:49.007 --> 01:01:52.374
That's just it. I was the youngest flack
ever put in charge of its entire division...

01:01:52.443 --> 01:01:53.842
in the history of
Mandell Kirschner.

01:01:53.912 --> 01:01:55.846
- I know.
- That's an accomplishment.

01:01:55.914 --> 01:01:59.281
Convincing a town to approve something
that's already in their best interest?

01:01:59.350 --> 01:02:02.842
- That's just delayed common sense.
- Yeah, but that's your life now.

01:02:02.921 --> 01:02:06.448
I mean, being the youngest flack
in the history of blah, blah, blah...

01:02:06.524 --> 01:02:09.925
that's not you anymore.
I mean, that might never have been you.

01:02:09.994 --> 01:02:12.326
Oh, it was me.
It was me with my own apartment,

01:02:12.397 --> 01:02:14.661
me richer, me with more self-respect.

01:02:14.732 --> 01:02:16.962
Like it or not, this is you.

01:02:17.035 --> 01:02:21.369
I mean, forget about what you thought
you were and just accept who you are.

01:02:22.373 --> 01:02:26.241
- I guess I'll just get this.
- Gert, what are you doing?

01:02:26.311 --> 01:02:30.213
I distinctly remember your father telling
you you could get Dirty Dancing.

01:02:30.281 --> 01:02:34.115
- Oh, yeah! He did!
- Yeah.

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.485
Thanks for that, by the way.

01:02:37.555 --> 01:02:41.252
Incidentally, she's been asking me
when she's gonna grow boobies like yours.

01:02:41.326 --> 01:02:44.124
- Oh, my God!
- She's seven, OK?

01:02:44.195 --> 01:02:48.131
If you want, I can give her the old “boobie”
talk my mom gave me when I was a kid.

01:02:48.199 --> 01:02:50.997
Does that talk include
using the word “knockers”?

01:02:59.010 --> 01:03:03.709
I'm glad there's no, you know,
awkwardness between us.

01:03:03.781 --> 01:03:08.980
After the... well, the thing
that happened last week with...

01:03:09.053 --> 01:03:11.544
Ollie, I was gonna give you a mercy jump.

01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:15.785
The moment passed.
It's no big deal.

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:19.387
- Just friends, right?
- Yeah, friends.

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:25.967
“Mercy jump.”
Stay away from my kid.

01:03:33.912 --> 01:03:36.847
- No, that's too round.
- Shut up.

01:03:36.915 --> 01:03:40.681
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Just make it...

01:03:40.752 --> 01:03:44.244
- Would you shut the hell up?!
- All right!

01:03:44.322 --> 01:03:47.155
There's people gettin'
their throats cut in this thing.

01:03:47.225 --> 01:03:48.522
Yep.

01:03:48.593 --> 01:03:51.153
And your father said
you could do this for the show?

01:03:51.229 --> 01:03:52.662
Yep.

01:03:53.364 --> 01:03:56.595
Why the hell would he
OK you singing this shit?

01:03:56.668 --> 01:04:00.195
Because I saw him and Maya
naked in the shower.

01:04:00.271 --> 01:04:02.034
Oh, yeah.

01:04:02.106 --> 01:04:04.597
That'll do it.

01:04:26.698 --> 01:04:30.828
Can I speak with
an Arthur Brickman, please?

01:04:40.511 --> 01:04:42.877
- Ollie.
- Arthur.

01:04:42.947 --> 01:04:44.938
- Hey, man.
- How're you doin'?

01:04:45.016 --> 01:04:48.213
- Good. How are you?
- Good. Good to see you.

01:04:48.286 --> 01:04:52.347
You know, the town voted unanimously,
approved the water main, so...

01:04:52.423 --> 01:04:54.755
You were always great with a crowd.

01:04:54.826 --> 01:04:57.920
Well, except that...
that once, of course.

01:04:57.996 --> 01:05:01.329
But that's it. It was the polar opposite
of the Fresh Prince incident.

01:05:01.399 --> 01:05:07.235
It was like I was on the top of my game.
Which is why I wanted to see ya.

01:05:07.305 --> 01:05:11.139
- I wanna ask you a favor.
- Anything, man. What?

01:05:11.209 --> 01:05:15.373
Is there any way that you could
get me an interview with your firm?

01:05:19.417 --> 01:05:21.885
You're serious?

01:05:21.953 --> 01:05:24.285
I thought it was weird
that you wanted to eat here.

01:05:24.355 --> 01:05:27.381
- Oh, I know it's gonna be tough...
- Tough?

01:05:27.458 --> 01:05:32.054
Ollie, you called a roomful of press
a bunch of jerk-offs,

01:05:32.130 --> 01:05:34.997
and trashed a client who's one of
the biggest movie stars on the planet.

01:05:35.066 --> 01:05:37.534
- He wasn't big then.
- No, but he is now.

01:05:37.602 --> 01:05:40.435
You wanna know how big?
When I left Mandell Kirschner,

01:05:40.505 --> 01:05:43.702
there were some firms that wouldn't
even look at my resume because I...

01:05:43.775 --> 01:05:46.175
No offense,
but because I worked under you.

01:05:48.046 --> 01:05:51.743
I've only been at Angellotti a year now...

01:05:51.816 --> 01:05:55.217
You know what, man? Forget I asked.
Don't worry about it. Seriously.

01:05:55.286 --> 01:05:58.187
- It was stupid. I got carried away...
- No, let me finish.

01:05:58.256 --> 01:06:00.781
What I was gonna say was...

01:06:00.858 --> 01:06:06.990
I've been waiting years to be in a position
to be able to help you out, and now I am.

01:06:07.065 --> 01:06:09.898
It's not gonna be an easy sell, but...

01:06:09.967 --> 01:06:13.926
I think I can get you in a room
with Angellotti himself.

01:06:14.739 --> 01:06:17.503
- Thank you so much.
- Of course.

01:06:20.178 --> 01:06:22.339
You know, you're a lot more affectionate
than I remember.

01:06:22.413 --> 01:06:26.213
It's just...
I miss it so much, you know?

01:06:26.284 --> 01:06:28.775
It's the only thing
I was ever any good at.

01:06:28.853 --> 01:06:31.651
Oh, this is great.
I can move back here...

01:06:31.722 --> 01:06:35.123
I can put Gertie in a really good,
expensive private school...

01:06:35.193 --> 01:06:38.094
I can get her a nanny, you know?

01:06:38.162 --> 01:06:42.360
It'll be like that whole Fresh Prince thing
never even happened.

01:06:42.433 --> 01:06:47.632
I'll work on the old man when I get back to
the office and call you tonight if it's a go.

01:06:47.705 --> 01:06:49.036
Oh, great.

01:08:10.821 --> 01:08:14.814
I was just on the phone with an old friend
that I worked with at Mandell Kirschner.

01:08:14.892 --> 01:08:18.453
I had lunch with him and I asked him if
he'd get me an interview with his new firm.

01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:22.295
Jesus, another interview, Ollie?
Come on, when are you gonna learn?

01:08:22.366 --> 01:08:26.894
Well, smart guy, he just called me,
said he sat down with his boss,

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:29.166
sold me to his boss
like I was the cure for cancer.

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:33.370
It just so happens that a little spot
has opened up in their music department.

01:08:33.444 --> 01:08:36.174
Boom!
After six years of being a pariah,

01:08:36.247 --> 01:08:38.305
I'm gonna get back in!

01:08:38.381 --> 01:08:40.077
I'm talkin' about
no more street sweeper,

01:08:40.151 --> 01:08:42.618
no more picking up garbage,
and no more water main!

01:08:42.687 --> 01:08:45.622
I'm talking press lines,
I'm talking about parties!

01:08:45.689 --> 01:08:48.090
I'm talking about a Westside address,

01:08:48.158 --> 01:08:50.252
I'm talkin' about
a good school for Gertie!

01:08:50.328 --> 01:08:51.988
But I already go to a good school.

01:08:52.063 --> 01:08:56.830
Yes, honey, but you're gonna go to a
way, way better school in New York City.

01:08:56.901 --> 01:08:59.495
You're gonna be able to take the
subway to school. Won't that be fun?

01:08:59.569 --> 01:09:01.765
But the subway's full of junkies
and mole-men.

01:09:04.375 --> 01:09:06.502
- Well, they are.
- Don't listen to Pop.

01:09:06.577 --> 01:09:08.602
What do I tell you?
He makes things up!

01:09:08.679 --> 01:09:10.977
- You'll see. The subways are great.
- I don't wanna see.

01:09:11.048 --> 01:09:14.506
I don't wanna go to a school up in the city.
I wanna go to my school.

01:09:14.585 --> 01:09:17.109
Honey, it's gonna be too far of a drive
for me to come back down here

01:09:17.188 --> 01:09:19.019
to take you to school
in New Jersey every morning.

01:09:19.090 --> 01:09:22.024
So let's not move to the city.
Let's stay here with Pop.

01:09:22.093 --> 01:09:26.029
Sweetheart, I'm too old
to be living with my father.

01:09:26.096 --> 01:09:28.189
I need to get my own place.

01:09:28.265 --> 01:09:30.564
And Pop... I mean, look at him,
he's a mad-dog.

01:09:30.635 --> 01:09:33.296
He doesn't want us around here
getting in his way, crampin' his style...

01:09:33.371 --> 01:09:37.398
- Do you, Pop?
- That's all horseshit.

01:09:37.475 --> 01:09:38.965
You know... thanks, Pop.

01:09:39.042 --> 01:09:41.603
I don't wanna move to the city.
I like it here.

01:09:41.679 --> 01:09:44.477
Pop says you can live here
as long as you want.

01:09:44.548 --> 01:09:47.176
Baby, remember when I took you
to see Sweeney Todd?

01:09:47.251 --> 01:09:49.344
How much fun was that?
We had a good time, right?

01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:52.287
I mean, if we move to New York City,
we can do that every night!

01:09:52.356 --> 01:09:54.347
Except for the nights you're working,
of course.

01:09:54.425 --> 01:09:56.393
You know what? Why don't you
shut up for a second, OK?

01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:58.587
I'm trying to talk to my daughter.

01:09:58.663 --> 01:10:01.063
You love New York City.
You told me you loved the city.

01:10:01.132 --> 01:10:02.622
- No, I didn't.
- Oh!

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:04.691
- I said it was OK.
- Jesus Christ!

01:10:04.769 --> 01:10:08.899
I said I like Highlands better. Why would
you want some other job anyway, Dad?

01:10:08.973 --> 01:10:10.304
You get to ride the Batmobile!

01:10:10.374 --> 01:10:13.309
Baby, Daddy doesn't wanna
drive the Batmobile!

01:10:13.377 --> 01:10:16.312
Daddy wants to eat sushi!
Daddy wants to hail cabs!

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:18.473
Daddy wants to have a doorman!

01:10:18.549 --> 01:10:21.074
Daddy wants to lord it
over magazine editors!

01:10:21.152 --> 01:10:26.385
Daddy loved his old job, and he's missed it
every day since he's been gone.

01:10:26.457 --> 01:10:30.450
Daddy wants to do that job. Daddy doesn't
wanna pick up garbage forever!

01:10:30.528 --> 01:10:32.928
But you told everybody at the meeting
that your job's good

01:10:32.997 --> 01:10:34.828
because you don't have to
wear a suit.

01:10:34.899 --> 01:10:39.097
Yes, but Daddy was just saying that
to get them to say yes to a water main.

01:10:39.170 --> 01:10:41.434
So you were just lying to everybody?

01:10:42.573 --> 01:10:46.703
Look, OK, I'll tell you what.
I'll go to the meeting, all right?

01:10:46.777 --> 01:10:49.268
If I don't like what the man says,
then I won't take the job.

01:10:49.347 --> 01:10:50.678
Now you're lying to me!

01:10:50.748 --> 01:10:53.273
All right, look, young lady! I'm gonna
go to this job interview on Monday,

01:10:53.351 --> 01:10:54.477
whether you like it or not.

01:10:54.552 --> 01:10:55.644
Wait, this Monday?

01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:58.382
- Yes.
- Ollie, you can't go on Monday.

01:10:58.456 --> 01:11:01.118
- Why?
- Because that's the day of my show!

01:11:04.161 --> 01:11:08.621
Oh, shit. It is, isn't it?

01:11:08.699 --> 01:11:12.191
Well, it's at four,
so I can, you know, make it back in time.

01:11:12.269 --> 01:11:13.566
But my show's at five!

01:11:13.637 --> 01:11:15.901
On what planet are you gonna
get back here by five

01:11:15.973 --> 01:11:17.702
if you've got a meeting
in the city at four?

01:11:17.775 --> 01:11:19.902
Just lay off me for a second!
I forgot about the show.

01:11:19.977 --> 01:11:22.172
How could you forget?
What, are you stupid?

01:11:22.246 --> 01:11:24.510
Gertie, this job
is very important to Daddy.

01:11:24.582 --> 01:11:26.914
What about my show?
Isn't that important to you?

01:11:26.984 --> 01:11:28.884
Yes, honey,
that's even more important to me.

01:11:28.953 --> 01:11:32.753
Then don't go to your stupid meeting about
your stupid new job in the stupid city!

01:11:32.823 --> 01:11:35.883
- That's enough, young lady!
- I don't even want you in the show!

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.723
You're not even a good
Sweeney Todd anyway.

01:11:37.795 --> 01:11:41.026
Pop's way better. Even Uncle Greenie
and Uncle Block are better than you.

01:11:41.098 --> 01:11:42.929
Those men are not your uncles!

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.764
Oh, no, but we're good enough
to build sets for her show, right?

01:11:45.836 --> 01:11:48.327
Sorry, I didn't mean that.
Where are you going?

01:11:48.406 --> 01:11:51.933
I don't wanna be around you! I don't even
want you to come to the show to watch it.

01:11:52.009 --> 01:11:56.412
- Oh, come on!
- I don't! I don't even like you anymore!

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.938
Get back here, young lady!
Hey! I'm talkin' to you!

01:12:00.017 --> 01:12:02.611
Hey, young lady!
Get back here, young lady!

01:12:02.686 --> 01:12:05.314
No! You can't tell me what to do!
I don't have to do anything you say!

01:12:05.389 --> 01:12:06.583
- Yes, you do!
- Why?

01:12:06.657 --> 01:12:08.090
Because I'm your father, that's why!

01:12:08.159 --> 01:12:10.286
- So what?
- Don't you yell at me, Gertrude!

01:12:10.361 --> 01:12:11.385
I'll yell at you all I want!

01:12:11.462 --> 01:12:13.953
Blah, blah, blah!
I'm not moving to the stupid city!

01:12:14.031 --> 01:12:17.091
All right, that's it! You are moving to the city
and you're gonna like it, and that's the end.

01:12:17.168 --> 01:12:19.602
I hate you!
I wish you'd died, not Mommy!

01:12:19.670 --> 01:12:21.103
I hate you right back, you little shit!

01:12:21.205 --> 01:12:25.107
You and your mother took my
life away and I just want it back!

01:12:34.151 --> 01:12:36.176
God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I didn't mean...

01:12:36.253 --> 01:12:37.413
- Get off me!
- I'm sorry...

01:12:37.488 --> 01:12:39.479
Get off of me!

01:12:46.864 --> 01:12:49.458

What happened to you the other night?
You just sort of took off.

01:14:54.692 --> 01:14:57.217
It looked to me like you guys
needed a little privacy.

01:14:57.294 --> 01:14:59.592
What I really needed was a little backup.

01:14:59.663 --> 01:15:02.496
She's a kid, Ollie.
Kids don't weather change well.

01:15:02.566 --> 01:15:05.899
I mean, in a few years, you won't
be able to keep her out of Manhattan.

01:15:05.970 --> 01:15:08.871
But for now,
she just wants what she knows.

01:15:08.939 --> 01:15:09.928
So do I.

01:15:10.007 --> 01:15:12.202
Yeah, but is that even
what you know anymore?

01:15:12.276 --> 01:15:14.267
Oh, Jesus. You too?

01:15:14.345 --> 01:15:18.179
You want your old life back. Big-money job,
out of your old man's house...

01:15:18.248 --> 01:15:20.580
It's not like it doesn't make any sense.

01:15:21.452 --> 01:15:22.851
Yeah. So?

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.650
That's your life that you want back,
not theirs.

01:15:25.723 --> 01:15:29.682
I mean, this is their life. What you're
sort of saying to everybody who loves you

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:31.819
is that what we have
isn't good enough for you.

01:15:31.895 --> 01:15:34.489
So it's just upsetting everybody,
you know?

01:15:35.132 --> 01:15:37.794
- Everybody?
- Oh... What, me?

01:15:38.135 --> 01:15:42.071
I mean, it's not like we've got some
big romance going on or anything.

maybe someday it might...

01:15:50.514 --> 01:15:53.642
be more than that?

For about two seconds, before you
had me hiding in the shower from your kid.

01:15:59.790 --> 01:16:01.849
Look, Ollie, I like you, but...

01:16:01.925 --> 01:16:05.122
I'm not gonna be all heartbroken
'cause you're leaving town.

01:16:05.195 --> 01:16:06.492

Even if I took this job in the city,

01:16:08.932 --> 01:16:15.098
I'd still come back down here
and visit my old man. And you.

01:16:15.172 --> 01:16:20.337
Why? I mean, you think I'm gonna
stick around here for much longer?

01:16:20.411 --> 01:16:22.845
- Maya...
- Ollie...

01:16:24.214 --> 01:16:27.047

you get all settled up in the big city.

for yelling at you the other night.

I was wrong. And I didn't mean
any of the things that I said.

01:18:38.148 --> 01:18:41.140
I know. Neither did I.

Yes! He's expecting you, sir.

01:20:43.941 --> 01:20:48.401
He apologizes, but he's stuck in traffic
He's just a few blocks away.

01:20:48.478 --> 01:20:51.811
Why don't you just have a seat
and I'll let him know that you've arrived.

- Excuse me?
- They love to keep you waiting.

01:21:16.039 --> 01:21:19.008
Right. Yeah, yeah, they do.

01:21:19.076 --> 01:21:22.102
I think they think it gives them
a psychological edge, you know?

01:21:22.179 --> 01:21:24.739
Well, it's about to give 'em
the edge of my ass,

01:21:24.815 --> 01:21:28.080
'cause that's all they're gonna see
when I'm walkin' out that door.

01:21:28.151 --> 01:21:30.517
You know anything about these guys?

01:21:30.587 --> 01:21:33.055
Only that they're the fastest-growing...

01:21:33.123 --> 01:21:36.923
“...firm in the business.”
Yes, I read that article too.

01:21:36.994 --> 01:21:39.155
All right, well...
You know as much as I do.

01:21:39.229 --> 01:21:41.390
I guess that means
they know what they're doing.

01:21:41.465 --> 01:21:45.731
I suppose. Unless these publicists hire other
publicists to get the word out for 'em.

01:21:45.802 --> 01:21:49.203
Right. And then those publicists
hire their own publicists

01:21:49.272 --> 01:21:52.639
to help spin the good publicity
they created for these publicists.

01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:55.473
Of course, knowing publicists,
they probably hire publicists

01:21:55.545 --> 01:21:57.103
to promote the fact
that they spun the publicity

01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:00.946
that they hired the other publicists
to spin. So...

01:22:01.018 --> 01:22:03.851
- Oh man! So what do you do?
- I'm a publicist.

01:22:06.456 --> 01:22:10.153
I didn't realize I was sitting here
talking to an Angellotti man.

01:22:10.227 --> 01:22:13.822
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'm not an Angellotti man.

01:22:13.897 --> 01:22:16.229
At least not yet.
I'm here trying to get a job.

01:22:16.299 --> 01:22:21.327
These guys have been tryin' to steal me
from my publicist since my last flick.

01:22:21.405 --> 01:22:24.374
- Oh, the robot movie, right?
- Oh, yeah, you saw it?

01:22:24.441 --> 01:22:26.739
I haven't gotten around to it yet.
I'm gonna...

01:22:26.810 --> 01:22:29.210
Oh, yeah. Thanks a lot
for the support though, man.

01:22:29.279 --> 01:22:33.181
- I wanna see it...
- You know what? It's not that good.

01:22:33.250 --> 01:22:35.946
I have a kid. I don't get a chance
to get out and see movies

01:22:36.019 --> 01:22:38.180
unless they have singing crabs in 'em.

01:22:38.255 --> 01:22:40.951
Singing crabs? I saw that one.
That means you have a girl.

01:22:41.024 --> 01:22:42.491
That's right.

01:22:42.559 --> 01:22:44.618
- How old is she?
- She's seven.

01:22:44.694 --> 01:22:47.254
Yeah? Cool.
I got a girl and two boys.

01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:49.230
Three kids?

01:22:49.299 --> 01:22:52.029
God. How do you find time
to make all those blockbusters?

01:22:52.102 --> 01:22:53.626
Shoot, if I didn't have
all them damn kids,

01:22:53.703 --> 01:22:55.568
I wouldn't have to
make these blockbusters.

01:22:55.639 --> 01:22:57.334
Right.

01:22:57.407 --> 01:22:59.398
Oh, man.

01:23:00.010 --> 01:23:03.036
- It's cool, though, isn't it?
- Making blockbusters?

01:23:03.113 --> 01:23:06.776
- You tell me.
- Bein' a parent, funny man.

01:23:08.085 --> 01:23:10.553
It has its moments.

01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:12.986
- What's your daughter's name?
- Gertrude.

01:23:13.356 --> 01:23:15.916
Damn!
Why'd you do that to that girl, man?

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:19.128
- Did you lose a bet?
- No.

01:23:19.196 --> 01:23:23.462
- No, it was my wife's name.
- “Was”? OK, let me guess.

01:23:23.533 --> 01:23:27.902
She took you for half after she
saddled the kid with the name Gert?

01:23:27.971 --> 01:23:31.566
I can't blame it on her.
I saddled the kid with the name Gert.

01:23:31.641 --> 01:23:34.701
She died in childbirth. So...

01:23:36.446 --> 01:23:39.210
- No, no, no, it's...
- I feel like an asshole, man.

01:23:39.282 --> 01:23:42.683
- Don't worry about it.
- No, listen, I'm really sorry about that.

01:23:42.752 --> 01:23:47.212
I didn't see your movie,
so we're even. Trust me.

01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:51.283
This is exactly why people don't talk
to each other in waiting rooms, right?

01:23:51.361 --> 01:23:54.330
Probably.
Although, I gotta tell ya...

01:23:54.397 --> 01:23:58.697
the fact that the guy who wrote “Parents
Just Don't Understand” is now a parent

01:23:58.768 --> 01:24:01.168
completely makes up for it.

01:24:02.005 --> 01:24:03.563
Oh, man.
We don't though, do we?

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:05.835
- What's that?
- Understand.

01:24:05.909 --> 01:24:10.437
I mean, these kids today. From the
door, man, they got it all over us.

01:24:10.547 --> 01:24:14.313
My daughter has it all over me,
I can tell you that.

01:24:14.384 --> 01:24:15.908
Yeah, my middle one, my son?

01:24:15.986 --> 01:24:18.546
Every time I walk out of the house
in the morning

01:24:18.622 --> 01:24:20.954
he says,
“Daddy, how far you love me?”

01:24:21.024 --> 01:24:23.788
I always pick somewhere close.
“I love you to that table, man.”

01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:28.194
“No, you don't. You love me all the way
to the moon and back down to the dirt.”

01:24:29.666 --> 01:24:30.428
That's great.

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:33.594
It take everything I got
to walk out of that house.

01:24:34.671 --> 01:24:36.730
You get to spend time with them
on the set though, right?

01:24:36.806 --> 01:24:41.106
Oh, yeah. But if I was a smart man,
I wouldn't be sittin' here right now.

01:24:41.178 --> 01:24:44.841
I'd be at home
playing in the dirt with my kids.

01:24:46.650 --> 01:24:49.517
But we all know that I'm not famous
'cause of my brains.

01:24:49.586 --> 01:24:54.455
It's 'cause I'm, like,
strikingly handsome, crazy sexy.

01:24:54.524 --> 01:24:58.551
And I'm, like,
hung like it's ridiculous.

01:24:59.896 --> 01:25:04.924
Oh, man! But I'm definitely not
the sharpest spoon in the shed.

01:25:07.337 --> 01:25:09.862
You know...

01:25:09.940 --> 01:25:12.932
- It was really nice talking to you.
- Oh, hey, you too, man.

01:25:13.009 --> 01:25:15.671
- You out?
- I'm out.

01:25:15.745 --> 01:25:17.679
Hey, you recommend these guys?

01:25:17.747 --> 01:25:21.513
Only guy I can recommend
is named Arthur Brickman.

01:25:21.585 --> 01:25:23.644
Other than that,
I can't vouch for anybody.

01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:26.814
Hold on. You Brickman?

01:25:27.958 --> 01:25:32.588
No. I'm just a guy who'd rather play
in the dirt with his kid.

01:27:32.449 --> 01:27:34.474
You gotta be kidding me!

01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:54.466

could you, Gert?

01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:15.419
Honey, it's gonna be OK.

01:28:16.559 --> 01:28:20.051
You're next, Gertie.
Break a leg.

01:28:57.967 --> 01:29:02.336

- Bye, Uncle Greenie. Bye, Uncle Block.
- Bye, sweetheart.

01:33:26.569 --> 01:33:28.935
- I'm startin' to like show business.
- Yeah.

01:33:29.005 --> 01:33:34.033
Well, don't get caught up in the glory.
Tomorrow you're on shithouse duty.

01:33:34.110 --> 01:33:39.412
You know, sometimes I just wanna...

01:33:39.482 --> 01:33:42.713
I'm so tired of being your little geisha.

01:33:42.785 --> 01:33:45.618
You had me worried there for a minute.

01:33:45.688 --> 01:33:49.590
Yeah, who knew all those years
you were nursing a case of stage fright.

01:33:49.659 --> 01:33:53.459
Not about that, smart ass.
About the other thing.

01:33:54.030 --> 01:33:58.023
- About moving away.
- Come on, Dad.

01:33:58.101 --> 01:34:00.160
Don't you wanna live alone again?

01:34:01.104 --> 01:34:04.335
Not as much as
I don't wanna die alone.

01:34:13.583 --> 01:34:15.574
We're not going anywhere, Pop.

01:34:23.126 --> 01:34:24.889
You wanna go over there
and cheer up your pop?

01:34:24.961 --> 01:34:28.522
He's devastated about
missing his big singing debut.

01:34:28.598 --> 01:34:30.589
Aw!

01:34:30.666 --> 01:34:32.861
Pop!

01:34:35.705 --> 01:34:37.730
Hey, Princess!

01:34:38.641 --> 01:34:41.769
Look at you.
Mr. Big Hero of the Night.

01:34:41.844 --> 01:34:46.338
Yeah, well, it might take me
longer than some, but I...

01:34:46.415 --> 01:34:48.747
May I?

01:34:48.818 --> 01:34:50.809
OK.

01:34:52.388 --> 01:34:55.414
I like to think
I come around eventually.

01:34:55.491 --> 01:34:58.688
Well, you showing up
when you did like that?

01:34:58.761 --> 01:35:02.663
That was just about
the most romantic thing I've ever seen.

01:35:04.233 --> 01:35:06.633
Honestly.

01:35:06.702 --> 01:35:09.637
Well... stick around.

01:35:11.607 --> 01:35:14.098
It may get even
more romantic than that.

01:35:14.177 --> 01:35:16.907
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:35:20.449 --> 01:35:23.612
See? How was that for romance?

01:35:27.056 --> 01:35:29.684
I'll think about it.
