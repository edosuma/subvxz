00:43.840 --> 00:45.079
Awesome. 

00:50.600 --> 00:52.839
Hey, does Mom know
you drive like that?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.919
Whatever, OK. Can you get your
stuff? I'm missing 90210.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.999
You know, you're lucky you
have all that gear in your mouth,

00:58.080 --> 01:00.479
'cause they need your teeth
to identify your charred remains.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.199
- Shut up! You're such a dick!
- Bye, Nicole.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.319
- ...time apart, that's all.
- Where is this coming from?

01:08.400 --> 01:10.199
You can come, all right?
It's not...

01:10.360 --> 01:13.039
Never mind. You don't want me
to come, I'm not coming.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.719
- Fine, then I want you out. Bye!
- Am I a partner or am I not?

01:15.800 --> 01:17.679
You don't support me.
You don't support me and my band.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.039
I support the band.
I love the band.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.439
Just get in the car.

01:22.480 --> 01:23.639
Don't hurry back.

01:25.440 --> 01:26.399
Come on!

01:30.640 --> 01:31.839
You missed a spot right here.

02:22.320 --> 02:23.719
Can I clear these for you, sir?

02:25.320 --> 02:26.879
Will you be wanting
any more peanuts?

02:27.200 --> 02:28.999
I think they have another
crate in the galley.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.159
Thanks.

02:33.640 --> 02:38.199
Oh, dear. All right, then.
I'll just be getting you a towel.

02:38.360 --> 02:39.639
Oh, dear, I'm...
Oh, I'm so sorry.

02:39.800 --> 02:40.879
I'm sorry.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.319
I'm fine, thank you.

02:55.720 --> 02:57.919
There's towels in here.
So I don't really need...

03:52.520 --> 03:56.359
- Everything all right, sir?
- Yeah, everything's good.

04:11.880 --> 04:12.839
Your attention, please.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.039
There has been a luggage
carousel change for flight 640.

04:17.959 --> 04:20.358
It will now be on carousel 4.

04:22.320 --> 04:23.279
Don't.

04:25.160 --> 04:26.159
I'm Oliver.

04:26.320 --> 04:30.879
- I just thought we'd chat...
- Blah, blah, blah.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.639
- See, it's ruined.
- What's ruined?

04:36.360 --> 04:37.719
Our little secret.

04:39.800 --> 04:43.159
Actually, I think the stewardess
was kind of onto us, so...

04:44.520 --> 04:46.079
Well, she'll have to be killed.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.559
- I'm Oliver.
- You keep saying that.

04:53.880 --> 04:56.119
Wow, you don't make
it easy for a guy.

04:58.040 --> 05:00.839
I think I made it pretty
easy for you, Oliver.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.519
So, what's Bon Jovi do?

05:28.080 --> 05:30.039
- Who?
- The boyfriend.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.199
Ex-boyfriend.

05:33.640 --> 05:35.039
Yeah, I noticed that.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.679
So, what happened there?

05:40.360 --> 05:41.799
What, are we friends now?

05:44.680 --> 05:46.639
I'd say we're a little bit
more than friends.

05:51.960 --> 05:54.199
Bon Jovi get a big record
contract or something?

05:54.280 --> 05:55.879
His name's not Bon Jovi.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.359
He plays guitar.

06:01.920 --> 06:04.759
- Everyone plays guitar.
- You play guitar?

06:07.040 --> 06:08.159
No.

06:09.880 --> 06:13.959
- Strike two.
- Strike two?

06:15.320 --> 06:16.639
What was strike one?

06:35.040 --> 06:37.719
Would you like to sit
next to your girlfriend?

06:39.520 --> 06:41.559
Thank you very much,
I'd love to.

07:01.680 --> 07:05.919
So, what's your deal, Oliver?
You're in New York on business?

07:07.160 --> 07:11.199
Me? Oh, thank you for asking.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.359
No, actually I'm here
visiting my brother.

07:14.800 --> 07:17.879
He's going to be a lawyer.
He's in law school, so...

07:21.880 --> 07:25.239
- Is that what you wanna do, too?
- I don't know.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.519
I just finished school.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.079
Don't people usually
graduate in June?

07:31.840 --> 07:32.879
Yeah.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.399
It's almost a year ago.
You still don't have a job?

07:36.320 --> 07:37.719
What are you, my mom?

07:38.200 --> 07:40.799
I don't know, when you look at me,
do you see your mom?

07:56.440 --> 07:59.079
- What sign are you?
- What sign am I?

08:02.280 --> 08:03.599
Cancer.

08:04.360 --> 08:05.559
Strike three.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.039
Thanks.

08:11.640 --> 08:12.799
It's Emily.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.079
I'd have never guessed Emily.

08:17.520 --> 08:18.679
Don't get mugged.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.279
How was your trip?

08:46.880 --> 08:48.599
You know... it was alright.

08:50.520 --> 08:51.799
Who's that?

08:52.320 --> 08:53.439
Don't be shy. C'mere.

08:53.640 --> 08:54.679
Meet my brother.

08:54.880 --> 08:56.399
I thought you'd like to catch up.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.479
This is my girlfriend.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.599
Hi. I'm Oliver.

09:01.720 --> 09:02.679
Nice to meet you.

09:02.760 --> 09:05.999
Nice to meet you too, Oliver.
I'm Carol. I've heard a lot about you.

09:06.560 --> 09:08.599
I'm sorry, I thought you were...

09:08.800 --> 09:11.039
You thought she was deaf, huh?

09:11.120 --> 09:11.919
Yeah.

10:08.440 --> 10:09.799
Thank you very much.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.479
- Where'd it go?
- What?

10:27.640 --> 10:30.159
- My jacket, it was right there.
- What jacket?

10:36.200 --> 10:37.679
I have seen no jacket.

10:39.520 --> 10:40.559
What?

10:41.280 --> 10:42.639
What can I get for 20?

10:43.280 --> 10:45.839
20? Dollars?

11:33.560 --> 11:36.039
You know, kissing a smoker
is like licking an ashtray.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.199
Really?
What's screwing one like?

11:41.480 --> 11:43.839
- You stalking me?
- Yes.

11:47.800 --> 11:50.399
Oh, somebody stole my jacket.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.279
You wanna do something?

11:53.880 --> 11:55.479
What, are we friends now?

11:56.040 --> 11:57.479
Here she is.

11:57.960 --> 12:00.999
- I thought you were using the ladies'.
- I was, but...

12:01.680 --> 12:03.119
I just came out to get some air.

12:03.280 --> 12:06.679
- Hi, I'm Brent, Emily's father.
- Hi, Oliver.

12:07.040 --> 12:08.279
- Christine.
- My stepmother.

12:08.360 --> 12:09.999
Ready for some Guggenheim?

12:10.680 --> 12:13.519
You know what? Would you
mind if I skipped the museum?

12:13.720 --> 12:17.519
- Christine took off work.
- I know, I'm sorry, it's just...

12:19.520 --> 12:21.239
Would you mind if I tell them?

12:24.400 --> 12:26.319
No, not at all.
Go ahead.

12:27.760 --> 12:29.999
Oliver is getting
some test results back today,

12:30.160 --> 12:32.279
and he was wondering
if I could go with him.

12:33.720 --> 12:36.279
It's a scary time. It's okay.

12:38.160 --> 12:39.159
It won't take long.

12:39.320 --> 12:42.759
Don't worry about that.
You take as long as you need.

12:43.960 --> 12:46.079
I'm sure
everything will turn out fine.

12:46.720 --> 12:47.799
You'll see.

12:49.840 --> 12:50.999
Good luck.

12:52.160 --> 12:53.919
- I'll see you later?
- Okay.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.879
Stuff like that's not even funny.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.119
You only get a chance
to make a first impression.

13:03.520 --> 13:05.119
What do you care
what my dad thinks?

13:06.360 --> 13:08.799
What if we hit it off,
become a thing or something?

13:11.400 --> 13:14.199
- What was that?
- You and I would never become a thing.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.279
You think pretty highly
of yourself, don't you?

13:18.360 --> 13:20.199
First, why would I get
mixed up with a guy

13:20.280 --> 13:22.599
who will jump
into an airplane bathroom

13:22.680 --> 13:24.559
with the first girl
that comes a-knocking?

13:26.320 --> 13:27.599
That was with you!

13:28.880 --> 13:31.439
You won't get mixed up with me
because I slept with you?

13:31.600 --> 13:33.959
Second, you're not even close
to being my type.

13:35.920 --> 13:38.359
I'm not looking for a girlfriend
anyway, so...

13:38.640 --> 13:41.239
Third, it turns out
you might be gay!

13:42.520 --> 13:44.279
I mean, I want a girlfriend.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.439
Whatever.
First things first, you know?

13:49.600 --> 13:52.199
- What things?
- I don't know.

13:54.240 --> 13:56.679
Make a plan
and get all my ducks in line.

13:57.280 --> 13:58.839
You mean ducks in a row?

13:59.680 --> 14:02.519
- Yes, I mean ducks in a row.
- What ducks are those?

14:03.360 --> 14:09.159
Like the normal kind of ducks.
Like, job, career, house, future.

14:09.720 --> 14:12.399
And then the girl of your dreams
will come and find you?

14:14.120 --> 14:15.239
Yep.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.879
I'll find her.
We'll find each other.

14:21.120 --> 14:24.359
Don't worry about me and
girls, okay? I do all right.

14:26.000 --> 14:26.959
Here.

14:33.600 --> 14:34.999
What's that? Stop!

14:36.240 --> 14:37.799
You're not unattractive.

14:44.080 --> 14:46.439
You do know it's the middle
of the afternoon, right?

14:57.120 --> 14:58.119
Two more?

14:59.760 --> 15:02.439
- I've still got stuff to do today, so...
- So do I.

15:04.480 --> 15:06.519
You know what?
Make them doubles.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.039
They are doubles.

15:20.720 --> 15:23.279
- Twenty-six.
- I got it.

15:23.760 --> 15:26.159
- I know.
- You know.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.079
You know what?
I don't mind paying,

15:30.440 --> 15:33.039
but I hate the fact that
you assume that I'm paying.

15:33.280 --> 15:37.719
At least make a move,
make the reach for it or something.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.879
What if you don't get
your ducks in a row?

15:50.160 --> 15:52.839
I'll get my ducks in a row.
In a line.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.119
What if it takes 20 years?

15:57.280 --> 16:00.039
It's not gonna take 20 years,
It's gonna take 5.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.679
6, maybe. Max.

16:04.560 --> 16:08.199
You don't even have a job,
not even an inkling of a job!

16:08.360 --> 16:09.839
That's not true.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.759
I'm interested in all the stuff
about the Internet.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.479
That's good,
I hear that's gonna be huge.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.399
- It will be.
- I'm sure.

16:21.320 --> 16:23.239
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No!

16:24.800 --> 16:27.719
I think you're gonna be beating
away chicks with a stick.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.879
You really think that
6 years from now,

16:31.080 --> 16:37.119
a guy like me, with a job, a
house, a nice car, and a future,

16:37.200 --> 16:38.599
you think I'm gonna have a problem

16:38.680 --> 16:40.479
finding somebody
to fall in love with me?

16:40.560 --> 16:42.319
I think you're gonna have
a big problem.

16:42.920 --> 16:43.879
You...

16:46.960 --> 16:48.119
What are you doing?

16:48.440 --> 16:52.679
I am writing down
my parents' phone number.

16:53.040 --> 16:54.759
- You live with your parents?
- No...

16:55.040 --> 16:56.919
Yes, but in 6 years I won't.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.359
So, why 6 years?

16:58.520 --> 17:01.799
If you let me finish,
it's my whole point.

17:02.120 --> 17:04.919
6 years from now,
you call this phone number,

17:05.800 --> 17:08.398
my parents will answer.
You ask them how to reach me.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.999
They'll give you the number.
Then you call my house,

17:12.160 --> 17:14.559
and when my beautiful wife
answers the phone,

17:14.720 --> 17:17.118
you'll ask her where to send
the 20 bucks you owe me.

17:17.280 --> 17:20.398
20? I thought you were gonna be
some hotshot business guy!

17:22.160 --> 17:24.039
Fine. 50.

17:25.160 --> 17:27.358
- 50 big ones.
- 50 it is.

17:46.560 --> 17:47.999
Any time before Christmas.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.959
- I'm saving my film.
- For what?

17:54.960 --> 17:57.799
For your trip? This is your trip,
it's happening right now.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.279
Be careful,
I got it for Christmas, so don't...

18:05.920 --> 18:07.359
You're not shooting me!

18:09.480 --> 18:11.559
All the places I've traveled.
Nice.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.159
- Mom's gonna love that one.
- Look alive.

18:14.480 --> 18:16.759
Act really natural
in your surrounding.

18:19.160 --> 18:22.159
Look sexy.
Let's see Ollie being sexy.

18:25.720 --> 18:26.959
I like it.

18:28.400 --> 18:29.959
There you go, that's good.

18:30.520 --> 18:31.599
Yeah!

18:32.200 --> 18:34.679
Make love to the tree.
Yeah!

18:35.800 --> 18:37.919
Now give it to me,
give me the camera.

18:39.240 --> 18:40.759
Would you give me the camera?

18:41.480 --> 18:43.999
- Are you done?
- You're out of film.

18:44.800 --> 18:45.839
No.

18:48.320 --> 18:51.399
- How did you shoot a whole roll?
- You're very shootable.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.719
Did I not just say
I'm saving the film?

18:58.160 --> 18:59.119
Hey.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.079
- Did you get the right one?
- Don't know.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.279
- 400 speed?
- I don't know, I just got film.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.639
- Was there change?
- Shut up. Give me that.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.159
I've got to go.

19:28.240 --> 19:29.399
Okay.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.199
- So...
- Don't.

19:42.640 --> 19:43.919
You'll ruin it.

20:23.480 --> 20:25.199
That was...

20:26.480 --> 20:28.079
That was pretty good.

20:28.920 --> 20:33.399
- Pretty good?
- All right, awesome.

20:36.240 --> 20:37.519
Mind-blowing.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.359
Out of this world.
Is that working for you?

20:40.520 --> 20:42.279
- Yeah.
- Yeah? All right.

20:42.960 --> 20:47.239
- Where are you going?
- I've got to work, I'm sorry.

20:51.800 --> 20:54.679
Oh, my God, are you serious?
I thought I was terrible.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.159
Let me just get a pen, hold on.

20:59.720 --> 21:00.879
Honey...

21:04.920 --> 21:06.159
Okay, go ahead.

21:08.440 --> 21:11.039
Is that the Valley?
Okay.

21:12.120 --> 21:13.599
No, am I gonna be late?

21:14.240 --> 21:18.279
Okay, I will, thank you.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.399
Okay, bye.

21:21.040 --> 21:22.799
I got it!

21:22.960 --> 21:27.079
- What? You got the part?
- No, I got a callback, but still!

21:28.000 --> 21:31.599
It's one of those low-budget
independent films, but who cares?

21:33.560 --> 21:36.279
Sweetie, will you just run
my lines with me before I go?

21:46.360 --> 21:47.879
Okay, what do you think?

21:48.400 --> 21:50.759
I don't wanna look too desperate,
even though I am.

21:52.600 --> 21:53.999
What are you doing?

21:55.320 --> 21:56.919
I'm going.

21:58.200 --> 22:01.559
You don't have to go.
You can have 2 whole hours here.

22:02.320 --> 22:03.279
I mean...

22:06.200 --> 22:09.199
I'm going. I'm sorry.

22:18.120 --> 22:21.039
- Martin, please, listen to me.
- Let go, Alexa.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.439
It can't end this way, Martin,
not like this.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.359
You should've thought
of that before.

22:27.240 --> 22:30.239
Don't turn your back on me, Martin.
You owe me more than that.

22:30.320 --> 22:32.919
I don't have any more to give, Alexa.
You've taken it all.

22:35.200 --> 22:38.759
- I'm sorry... Look at me, Martin.
- Okay, thank you.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.559
Sorry, I just lost my place.

22:41.040 --> 22:43.319
Emily, it's very, very good.

22:43.480 --> 22:46.159
Just try and keep in mind
how much you love him.

22:46.840 --> 22:47.959
- Martin?      - Yeah.
- Okay.

22:48.040 --> 22:50.679
He's the love of her life,
so how would it make her feel,

22:50.760 --> 22:52.759
if he was leaving her?

22:53.920 --> 22:56.599
- Desperately unhappy?
- Exactly.

22:57.360 --> 23:01.799
One more thing.
Keep in mind she's a vampire.

23:02.560 --> 23:04.799
Okay, here we go.
And action.

23:08.960 --> 23:10.919
You're better off.
That's what I think.

23:11.240 --> 23:12.319
Of course she's better off.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.759
Dumps you right before
New Year's, that's awful!

23:14.960 --> 23:17.239
I didn't say anything
while you were seeing him,

23:17.320 --> 23:19.439
but it's always got to be
about him.

23:19.960 --> 23:22.639
I didn't see Peter that way at all.
He could be too nice.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.759
I guess you're right.
But she's still better off.

23:26.920 --> 23:29.999
- She is much better off.
- When it's over, it's over.

23:30.840 --> 23:32.759
- You're coming tomorrow, right?
- She is.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.959
How about a blind date?
I know someone.

23:36.360 --> 23:38.639
- You can't take a blind date to New Year's.
- Why?

23:39.360 --> 23:41.999
It's a blind date.
You don't roll the dice on New Year's.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.639
- You don't go alone either.
- Why not? I'm going alone.

23:44.720 --> 23:47.599
- Well, that's you.
- What does that mean?    - Just saying.

23:48.360 --> 23:52.159
The point is, it's New Year's,
and date or no date,

23:52.840 --> 23:54.559
you just don't spend
New Year's alone.

23:56.160 --> 23:57.679
Don't. She quit.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.759
Hi, is David there?

24:21.040 --> 24:22.479
Hi, is Chris there?

24:22.760 --> 24:24.759
Hi, I was looking for Frank.

24:29.680 --> 24:34.239
Yeah, most normal
people have plans,

24:34.320 --> 24:36.919
being that it's New Year's and all,
but thanks anyway.

24:38.400 --> 24:42.119
Do you happen to know
if he'll be back later or?

24:47.160 --> 24:48.439
What's your name?

25:30.040 --> 25:31.399
Hello, Martin residence.

25:33.800 --> 25:36.839
Hello?

25:37.000 --> 25:37.999
Hey, hello?

25:38.720 --> 25:40.759
Hi. Is Oliver there?

25:41.480 --> 25:43.679
Yes, just a second.
Oliver!

25:43.960 --> 25:46.759
- Yeah?
- Telephone!

25:49.840 --> 25:50.839
Hello?

25:51.680 --> 25:54.319
- Hello? Oliver?
- This is.

25:55.960 --> 26:00.079
This is Emily.
I don't know if you remember me.

26:00.360 --> 26:03.199
- New York Emily?
- Yeah.

26:03.720 --> 26:07.239
- Hello?
- I got it, Ellen.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.639
Okay, God.
I didn't know, sorry.

26:10.200 --> 26:13.479
What a goofball, huh?
You still there?

26:13.920 --> 26:15.199
Yeah, I'm here.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.639
So what's up?

26:17.920 --> 26:20.399
I was just wondering...

26:20.560 --> 26:22.519
I just came across your number
all of a sudden

26:22.680 --> 26:24.639
and I was thinking to myself...

26:26.080 --> 26:28.199
"I wonder what Oliver's doing."

26:28.800 --> 26:31.119
I know that you're
probably busy tonight,

26:31.280 --> 26:34.039
but maybe you want to grab
a coffee this afternoon.

26:36.640 --> 26:38.479
- Sure.
- Really?

26:38.760 --> 26:40.639
- Oliver.
- I'm on the phone, Ellen.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.839
When you getting off?
I'm expecting a call.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.079
- You've got a pager.
- I can't talk on a pager!

26:45.240 --> 26:48.719
- Ellen, get off the phone.
- You are such a dick!

26:48.880 --> 26:51.719
Get off the phone, Ellen! Mom,
tell Ellen to get off the phone.

26:51.880 --> 26:53.639
- Ellen!
- Hello?

26:54.520 --> 26:57.319
Sorry about that.
You still there?

26:58.080 --> 26:59.039
Yeah.

27:01.560 --> 27:03.479
Where are you?
I'll come over.

27:04.200 --> 27:07.559
- Now?
- Yes. Why don't I come over?

27:22.160 --> 27:23.799
- Hello?
- Hello, it's me.

27:24.120 --> 27:27.559
The gate's broken, so just
give it a jiggle and then push.

27:36.680 --> 27:38.639
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:43.560 --> 27:46.759
- I'm Emily.
- I'm Oliver.

27:47.200 --> 27:48.599
You're not Oliver.

27:51.760 --> 27:54.879
That's it? I thought
you'd at least invite him in.

27:55.080 --> 27:56.599
You owe me 10 dollars.

27:56.880 --> 27:59.159
I knew he wasn't you,
you're not that good-looking.

28:01.560 --> 28:03.679
She says you're not
that good looking.

28:04.320 --> 28:06.759
- She didn't say that.
- What did he tell you I said?

28:06.840 --> 28:08.759
- I said you were good-looking.
- Told you.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.759
That's what I said. You...

28:11.680 --> 28:13.519
She didn't say that.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.719
She's backpedaling.

28:16.840 --> 28:19.719
- He's a little...
- He's saying you're crazy.

28:19.880 --> 28:21.359
Yeah, I got that.

28:24.560 --> 28:25.839
Did she honk?

28:27.080 --> 28:28.319
Why?

28:29.480 --> 28:34.239
- My wife. I'm going. Bye.
- Bye.

28:34.320 --> 28:35.279
Thanks for the ride.

28:35.400 --> 28:36.479
Have fun.

28:41.240 --> 28:42.559
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:45.320 --> 28:46.959
- You look different.
- So do you.

28:47.120 --> 28:49.719
- But, good different.
- You, too. I like your hair.

28:49.920 --> 28:51.039
Thank you.

28:52.320 --> 28:53.559
I'm still signing.

28:54.720 --> 28:57.639
Why? I don't know.
I'm stopping, okay.

28:59.880 --> 29:01.919
Your brother screen
all your dates?

29:03.080 --> 29:04.559
This is a date?

29:24.440 --> 29:26.839
Can I get you anything to drink?
A tea or a soda?

29:27.000 --> 29:29.319
- I'm good, thanks.
- Just gonna grab a beer.

29:37.640 --> 29:40.359
I can't believe you assumed
this was what this was about.

29:45.200 --> 29:48.199
You can't believe I assumed
that what was about the what?

29:49.560 --> 29:51.999
Because I'm not the same girl
you met 3 years ago.

29:52.160 --> 29:55.879
I mean, I'm the same girl,
but it's not the same situation.

29:57.440 --> 29:58.399
I understand.

29:58.480 --> 30:00.279
I don't need to sleep
with someone

30:00.440 --> 30:03.879
after every stupid breakup
just to prove she's still got it. I...

30:04.320 --> 30:05.439
Yeah.

30:06.680 --> 30:07.959
What are you doing?

30:09.400 --> 30:12.799
I am looking
for your crazy pills.

30:13.560 --> 30:16.359
They have to be around here
for moments like these, right?

30:17.680 --> 30:21.359
That's not funny.
What if I really was crazy?

30:23.240 --> 30:24.919
Have you eaten today?

30:26.800 --> 30:28.999
How can you live in LA
and not have a car?

30:29.880 --> 30:34.199
I had a car, then I sold it.
I needed the capital for my business.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.479
That's right.
The plan! The ducks.

30:37.640 --> 30:38.999
It's all coming back to me now.

30:39.160 --> 30:43.159
Only two and a half more years
until you're rich.

30:43.440 --> 30:46.279
Is your wife gonna live in
your parents' basement with you?

30:46.480 --> 30:49.559
- I don't live with my parents.
- Just visiting?

30:49.840 --> 30:52.239
I was just picking some stuff up
'cause I'm moving.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.399
"Diaperrush. Com"?

30:55.680 --> 30:58.999
That's what it says.
We sell diapers on the Internet.

30:59.320 --> 31:01.759
I thought the whole Internet
thing was done already.

31:01.840 --> 31:04.959
- Just need a good business plan.
- Diapers?

31:06.440 --> 31:10.799
- How's Bon Jovi? Does he still rock?
- Who?

31:12.480 --> 31:15.439
Oh, him. He switched bands
and moved to Seattle.

31:15.600 --> 31:19.599
Nice. Hope he knows how to steam
milk and make chocolate shavings.

31:19.760 --> 31:21.399
Big talk coming from
a diaper salesman.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.039
Okay.

31:24.360 --> 31:27.999
And the latest breakup? What's he do?
Is he a baseball player, a cosmonaut?

31:28.080 --> 31:30.039
- Who said I had a breakup?
- You did.

31:30.880 --> 31:33.279
In your kitchen
during your hypoglycemic rant.

31:35.120 --> 31:38.359
- So? Spill it. Who's the guy?
- I'm not telling you.

31:41.240 --> 31:43.719
Did you dump him?
No. He dumped you.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.199
- I'm not gonna talk about it.
- Okay.

31:47.040 --> 31:50.079
- Then I'm not talking at all.
- You're not talking?

31:50.560 --> 31:53.479
- You aren't getting boo out of me.
- I'm not talking either.

34:19.159 --> 34:20.958
Okay, fine. I'll tell you.

34:22.719 --> 34:25.839
My brother's deaf,
I can go days without talking.

34:28.600 --> 34:29.839
Can we have the check, please?

34:35.040 --> 34:38.438
- I met him in class.
- Yeah? You went back to school?

34:39.360 --> 34:42.039
- Acting class.
- He's an actor!

34:43.040 --> 34:45.759
Wow, actors! That's
one rung up from musicians.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.759
He was a writer.
He is a writer.

34:48.960 --> 34:52.119
Hi. Could I get a coffee?
Just very black.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.279
- After you.
- Sorry, go ahead.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.518
- Frappuccino, please.
- All right.

34:58.480 --> 35:01.679
I believe the question was
who dumped whom?

35:03.320 --> 35:04.599
He left me.

35:06.720 --> 35:08.359
- I got it.
- No, I got it.

35:09.800 --> 35:11.759
No, but I appreciate the reach.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.959
The acting classes
are really paying off, but I got it.

35:15.040 --> 35:16.759
Shut up, I got it.

35:22.560 --> 35:24.039
What are your plans?

35:25.520 --> 35:28.759
- Plans for what?
- Tonight. It is New Year's.

35:31.320 --> 35:32.919
I'm not a really big New Year's guy.

35:33.480 --> 35:36.959
- Bunch of amateurs getting drunk.
- Yeah.

35:37.600 --> 35:43.599
- Cringy people wearing those party hats.
- The hats... Lame.

35:46.960 --> 35:49.039
- I know of a party.
- Really?    - Let's go.

35:55.160 --> 35:58.519
You've got more clothes in your trunk
than I've got in my whole closet.

35:59.760 --> 36:00.799
Try this.

36:01.440 --> 36:03.439
Nice. Is this Bon Jovi's?

36:04.320 --> 36:07.999
Should I act like I'm some big
Hollywood-producer type or something?

36:08.160 --> 36:09.559
Just be yourself.

36:10.360 --> 36:12.799
Except maybe don't mention
the whole diaper thing.

36:15.520 --> 36:17.879
Hey, Emily.
I've got to ask you something.

36:18.040 --> 36:19.839
- Do you mind?
- Sorry.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.599
What do you have to ask me?

36:24.160 --> 36:26.519
- What was strike one?
- What?

36:27.600 --> 36:31.159
In New York. Strike two was
that I didn't play guitar.

36:31.720 --> 36:36.039
Strike three was that I was born
under the wrong star sign.

36:38.840 --> 36:40.519
What was strike one?

36:40.680 --> 36:43.279
Strike one was
that I had to make the first move.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.399
I got strike one
before we even met?

36:47.600 --> 36:50.319
You can't get strike one
before you step up to the plate.

36:56.120 --> 36:57.239
You drive.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.439
- I introduced myself.
- What?

37:05.080 --> 37:08.119
In New York. I introduced myself.
That's not a move?

37:08.520 --> 37:11.639
- Who called who today?
- I didn't have your number.

37:12.080 --> 37:13.639
You never asked.

37:16.040 --> 37:19.599
You came!
And with a young man in tow.

37:20.200 --> 37:22.639
This is Michelle
and Michelle's fiancé, Michael.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.879
Hi. Oliver.

37:26.400 --> 37:27.799
I sell diapers.

37:29.360 --> 37:31.239
- Well, it's nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

37:32.600 --> 37:36.359
- Hello, ladies.
- Oh, my God! Look at you.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.279
- Get you a drink?
- I'm good, thanks.

37:44.120 --> 37:45.599
I think I'll get one.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.599
You are not getting off
that easy.

37:53.120 --> 37:54.479
He's an old friend.

37:54.640 --> 37:57.119
I wish I had an old friend like that.
He's gorgeous.

37:57.480 --> 37:59.039
Come on, give it up.

38:07.280 --> 38:10.439
Very carefully,
I want you to move backwards

38:10.960 --> 38:12.599
in the direction of the bar.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.839
- Hello?
- Ellen, it's me.

38:25.520 --> 38:26.679
What do you want, Oliver?

38:27.400 --> 38:29.799
I'm at this big Hollywood party

38:29.960 --> 38:33.279
and I just ran into
the white rapper guy you like.

38:33.560 --> 38:35.959
Eminem? No way!

38:36.120 --> 38:39.239
So I'm sitting at the bar, right?
And we're talking.

38:39.400 --> 38:43.359
And out of nowhere, he starts running
his hand up and down my leg.

38:46.400 --> 38:47.839
Happy New Year, Ellen.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.959
You're such a dick, Oliver!

38:51.600 --> 38:53.359
- Thank you.
- Eminem's here?

38:58.320 --> 38:59.999
Who's he talking to? Her?

39:00.520 --> 39:01.919
Some guy.

39:03.680 --> 39:06.279
- Now he's talking to her.
- She just kissed him.

39:06.440 --> 39:08.679
- Kissed who?
- Peter. She's kissing Peter.

39:08.840 --> 39:10.319
Is he kissing her back?

39:25.960 --> 39:29.279
Sorry, I couldn't hear you.
It think you said you sell diapers?!

39:29.440 --> 39:32.119
There you are! Come on.

39:53.320 --> 39:55.759
Put your hands on my ass.
That'll really get him.

40:04.160 --> 40:06.119
Do you want me
to put my hands on your ass?

40:12.600 --> 40:14.399
- You all right?
- Yeah.

40:14.560 --> 40:18.519
I'm gonna go to the ladies' room.
I'll be right back.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.519
Incredible!

40:37.240 --> 40:38.479
Let's go!

40:41.600 --> 40:42.639
Come on in here, you all!

40:42.920 --> 40:45.319
This is New Year's,
and you all know how this goes.

41:12.680 --> 41:13.999
Cheat on me and I kill you!

41:22.600 --> 41:24.999
Here we go,
time for the countdown.

41:25.480 --> 41:30.319
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

41:30.480 --> 41:35.279
five, four, three, two, one!

41:35.640 --> 41:39.159
Happy New Year!

41:59.440 --> 42:01.119
- Clearly...
- Shh!

42:01.280 --> 42:05.999
- Clearly, you're not a fan of...
- Shh!

42:06.840 --> 42:10.759
I'm serious. My neighbors are,
like, flip-out kind of people.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.879
- Okay, that's enough.
- Having a problem? Very serious.

42:17.400 --> 42:19.559
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

42:22.880 --> 42:23.839
Oliver...

42:25.160 --> 42:26.679
You've been robbed.

42:27.280 --> 42:29.479
- I'm moving.
- You are?

42:31.040 --> 42:33.639
- Yeah, I told you.
- You did?

42:35.560 --> 42:37.479
It's official, the power's off.

42:38.040 --> 42:39.479
When did you tell me?

42:41.440 --> 42:42.639
Earlier.

42:43.720 --> 42:46.479
My business.
It's in San Francisco.

42:47.880 --> 42:49.359
When are you leaving?

42:52.040 --> 42:53.239
Tomorrow.

43:01.760 --> 43:03.879
- Ollie...
- Yeah?

43:05.040 --> 43:06.519
Nice, thank you.

43:10.960 --> 43:12.439
Hey, I took this.

43:14.320 --> 43:15.719
Yeah, I know.

43:18.200 --> 43:19.639
You framed it.

43:20.920 --> 43:23.039
- Yeah, I liked it.
- You framed my picture.

43:24.760 --> 43:26.319
It's a good picture.

43:27.760 --> 43:29.039
Wow.

43:31.560 --> 43:34.159
Just when I'm starting to like
you, you're moving away.

43:44.760 --> 43:46.359
Can I tell you something?

43:51.320 --> 43:54.359
I think that... it's time that...

43:58.360 --> 44:00.359
I think it's time that I stop...

44:03.120 --> 44:04.679
being somebody's...

44:05.920 --> 44:07.319
girlfriend.

44:07.640 --> 44:10.039
Hold on one second.
Just one sec.

45:17.320 --> 45:25.919
Emily?

45:39.680 --> 45:40.799
You okay?

45:47.440 --> 45:48.799
You gonna throw up?

47:25.720 --> 47:27.999
Hey, baby. I'm home.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.039
Sorry I'm late.
I got hung up at the office.

47:31.240 --> 47:33.599
On the phone with some
bean-counters from Huggies.

47:33.840 --> 47:36.999
- Did you remember the wine?
- The what?   - The wine.

47:40.400 --> 47:43.159
I forgot. You know what?
I'll get it right now.

47:43.760 --> 47:45.399
Don't bother,
I already picked it up.

47:47.640 --> 47:49.239
Why'd you ask me
if I got it then?

47:49.400 --> 47:51.399
'Cause I knew
you wouldn't remember.

47:51.560 --> 47:53.039
I knew you'd forget it.

47:55.520 --> 47:59.359
Well, that's something of a
self-fulfilling prophecy then, huh?

47:59.840 --> 48:01.639
You know what, Oliver?
You're never here.

48:01.720 --> 48:04.239
And even when you are here,
you're still not here.

48:05.040 --> 48:06.439
I'm here right now.

48:07.640 --> 48:09.239
Have you seen my red shirt?

48:16.760 --> 48:19.839
- I can't do it anymore, Ollie.
- Can't do what?

48:21.320 --> 48:22.639
This.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.359
What are you trying to say?

48:31.360 --> 48:34.399
I don't know, Ollie,
I think we need to take a break.

48:59.520 --> 49:02.599
- Hi. Do you mind if I?
- I'm sorry.

49:02.840 --> 49:04.839
I was gonna get that.

49:06.840 --> 49:09.359
- Well, there's a bunch more.
- Right.

49:10.120 --> 49:14.199
- You wanna trade?
- No, thanks, I'm gonna take this one.

49:14.360 --> 49:16.319
So I see you knew
it was the import.

49:16.480 --> 49:20.199
- Very sneaky. Very sly.
- It's got the acoustic B-side.

49:20.360 --> 49:22.159
And a bonus track.
So you see my dilemma.

49:22.240 --> 49:24.919
I can't let you walk out
of this store with the last copy.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.279
I'm not gonna walk out,
I'm gonna pay for it first.

49:27.360 --> 49:28.999
Wait a minute.
Don't I know you?

49:29.160 --> 49:30.919
Jeez, spare me the pickup line.
Here.

49:31.080 --> 49:33.239
No, it wasn't a pickup line.
I do know you.

49:33.600 --> 49:35.159
Michelle Foster's wedding.

49:35.520 --> 49:38.599
- I went to school with her husband.
- Yeah, wait. Ben something.

49:38.680 --> 49:41.679
That's right.
Ben Miller. And you are...

49:43.840 --> 49:45.319
Emily.

49:46.080 --> 49:49.159
- Here.
- No, I couldn't.

49:49.320 --> 49:50.679
- Come on, take it.
- It's yours.

49:50.760 --> 49:53.879
- Just take it, seriously, I feel bad.
- It's yours.

49:54.680 --> 49:57.799
- You know you want it.
- I do want it.   - Take it.

49:58.960 --> 50:00.279
- Really?
- Yeah.

50:03.560 --> 50:05.199
Can't believe you just took it.

50:11.080 --> 50:13.199
Thanks for looking
those contracts over.

50:13.520 --> 50:15.719
I'm sorry about Bridget.

50:16.800 --> 50:17.999
I really liked her.

50:18.200 --> 50:19.439
Tell Carol, "Hi"...

50:19.640 --> 50:20.839
...and my nephew.

50:21.280 --> 50:22.279
Will do.

50:23.440 --> 50:25.199
- Airport.
- Yeah.

50:27.920 --> 50:30.879
Dude, this is what I want.
Exactly like this.

50:31.040 --> 50:33.279
- All black like Batman.
- Very cool.    - Yep.

50:33.480 --> 50:35.919
- What are you doing?
- Test-driving. Hop in the back.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.079
You should get one too,
like Batman and Robin,

50:38.240 --> 50:40.319
except without the tights.

50:40.480 --> 50:42.759
It's like...
Where you gonna park it?

50:43.080 --> 50:45.039
This thing?
Wherever I want.

50:47.720 --> 50:49.439
We're not in the money yet.

50:49.800 --> 50:53.759
You heard your brother, right?
We wow them in New York, it's a lock.

50:54.120 --> 50:55.519
Come on, hop in.

50:58.200 --> 51:01.559
I'm gonna stick around here
and finish some stuff up.

51:01.880 --> 51:03.519
Would you relax, please?

51:04.120 --> 51:06.719
Take a step back, man.
You're starting to depress me.

51:08.480 --> 51:11.039
Take a weekend off,
do something for yourself, okay?

51:51.480 --> 51:52.879
Beautiful.

51:54.280 --> 51:55.919
- Gorgeous.
- Come on, Hailey.

51:56.080 --> 51:57.319
Wait, Hailey!

51:58.200 --> 52:00.679
Hailey, hold on. Sweetie!

52:03.960 --> 52:06.879
Oh, my God, are you guys kidding?
Get a room.

52:08.640 --> 52:10.439
I can't help it, he's so hot.

52:10.800 --> 52:12.519
Hi, Emily.

52:12.680 --> 52:16.079
- Thank God you can't get pregnant
when you're pregnant.      - Hi.

52:16.840 --> 52:22.359
- So, you and Ben went on a little date?
- Yeah, we had lunch.

52:23.480 --> 52:24.759
It was nice.

52:26.200 --> 52:28.799
- That's all I'm gonna get out of you, isn't it?
- Yeah.

52:28.880 --> 52:30.879
Then I should probably
get back to work.

52:31.040 --> 52:32.679
- Bye, honey.
- Bye, sexy.

52:32.920 --> 52:34.279
- Bye.
- Bye.

52:36.200 --> 52:38.639
Lunch? What's the matter?
You don't like him?

52:38.920 --> 52:41.279
Why? Just 'cause we didn't jump
right into the sack?

52:41.440 --> 52:43.159
What's jumping in the sack?

52:44.760 --> 52:46.999
It's a game people play
at picnics, honey.

53:04.880 --> 53:05.959
Hey.

53:14.960 --> 53:20.039
I do weddings, head shots,
baby showers, for the money,

53:20.200 --> 53:22.199
but I met a girl at a party,
a gallery owner,

53:22.280 --> 53:25.239
and she said she might show
my work there, so...

53:25.720 --> 53:27.319
That's really cool.
How'd you do that?

53:27.480 --> 53:30.679
You leave the shutter open.
The hard part's staying still,

53:30.840 --> 53:33.799
otherwise you're just a blur,
like the cars in the background.

53:35.880 --> 53:38.719
I'm gonna go splash
some water on my face.

53:38.920 --> 53:40.519
So make yourself at home.

53:45.800 --> 53:49.279
Wait, he just landed on your
doorstep? Honey, that's perfect.

53:49.440 --> 53:51.839
Don't get excited,
he lives 400 miles away.

53:52.240 --> 53:53.879
Emily, let's not get picky.

53:54.080 --> 53:55.959
And I couldn't look less sexy.

53:56.120 --> 53:57.799
Stop it, you're gorgeous.

53:57.960 --> 54:00.559
- Has he put the moves on you yet?
- He's not the type.

54:00.640 --> 54:02.839
Someone's gonna have sex.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.519
Will you stop it?
I've got to go, wish me luck.

54:05.680 --> 54:07.439
You don't need it. Call me.

54:11.160 --> 54:13.319
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

54:18.840 --> 54:22.519
She owned a business, right?
Like, selling antiques.

54:22.600 --> 54:25.079
She used to work
for the mayor's office as an advisor.

54:25.160 --> 54:27.999
- But she said she didn't like it.
- Wow, two careers already.

54:28.160 --> 54:31.599
Yeah. So I thought
she would understand

54:31.760 --> 54:36.079
the kind of work you've got to put in
when you're first starting out, but...

54:39.480 --> 54:44.279
She said that she couldn't be
number 3 or number 4

54:44.680 --> 54:46.719
on someone's list of priorities.

54:48.360 --> 54:52.239
She said she could be number 2,
but not if number 1 was selling diapers.

54:53.920 --> 54:57.959
Hi, it's me calling to see
how things are going.

54:58.720 --> 55:00.639
This is... Hi. Hello?

55:00.800 --> 55:03.319
It's a work-related call.
I'll just be one second.

55:04.040 --> 55:05.239
Yes, can you get the?

55:05.480 --> 55:09.839
Please figure out if the negatives
are gonna be ready by tomorrow.

55:10.880 --> 55:12.679
- What?
- How's it going?

55:13.200 --> 55:15.519
- It's not.
- It'll be fine.

55:15.800 --> 55:18.279
As long as you're not wearing
that orange sweatshirt.

55:19.200 --> 55:20.599
Don't call back here.

55:24.080 --> 55:25.799
Sorry about that, I just...

55:27.880 --> 55:32.039
- Where are you going?
- What's your stance on pancakes?

55:35.240 --> 55:37.119
I'm pro pancakes.

55:42.800 --> 55:44.439
Do you know
what you're gonna have yet?

55:45.600 --> 55:46.839
I just can't...

55:50.280 --> 55:52.319
I can't decide what to get.

55:56.880 --> 55:59.279
Come on, Ollie,
you've got to just let it go.

55:59.920 --> 56:02.559
Smile.
You're here with me.

56:08.640 --> 56:10.359
There it is.
That's the one.

56:11.240 --> 56:12.319
Hi.

56:15.160 --> 56:18.919
- Gina, hi! How are you?
- I'm good, how are you?

56:19.080 --> 56:21.759
- Good. It's been such a long time.
- Really long, yeah.

56:21.920 --> 56:23.679
- I've been meaning to call you.
- Me too.

56:23.840 --> 56:27.399
I was hoping we could actually
get together and talk a bit.

56:27.680 --> 56:30.279
- Yeah, that would be great.
- It'd be good.

56:30.800 --> 56:33.159
Do you have a couple of bucks
for the waitress?

56:35.680 --> 56:37.519
Emily. Hi.

56:37.680 --> 56:40.799
- Hey.
- How's everything? How are you?

56:41.080 --> 56:43.319
- I'm good.
- Yeah? You're good?     - Yeah.

56:44.240 --> 56:45.959
- Great.
- I was gonna sneak on by

56:46.120 --> 56:49.079
but then I thought, "I saw you,
so you probably saw me and..."

56:49.760 --> 56:53.639
Yeah, it's good
that you both said hi.

56:54.480 --> 56:58.039
I knew that she'd be fine with it.
It's been a long time.

56:58.480 --> 57:00.239
Yeah, I'm glad you...

57:02.800 --> 57:05.439
- Hi. Oliver.
- Peter.

57:06.600 --> 57:08.639
- Oliver.
- Good to see you again.

57:11.040 --> 57:13.399
We should probably go
if we're gonna catch that...

57:13.480 --> 57:17.439
- You're right. Emily, take care.
- Take care, it was good to see you.

57:17.600 --> 57:19.519
- Bye.
- Nice meeting you!

57:23.160 --> 57:24.559
I'm starving.

57:26.160 --> 57:28.599
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.

57:34.840 --> 57:37.759
All right.
Come on. Let it go.

57:39.080 --> 57:41.039
Smile.
You're with me.

57:42.480 --> 57:43.519
Shut up.

57:50.480 --> 57:52.119
Get off the road, grandma!

57:57.200 --> 57:58.439
Come on.

57:59.680 --> 58:02.839
Let it go.
Smile, you're with me.

58:08.640 --> 58:09.719
Where are we going?

58:10.960 --> 58:12.119
We're heading north.

58:15.360 --> 58:18.519
I've been killing myself at work.
Nights, weekends.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.679
Even at home, Bridget's home.

58:23.200 --> 58:24.519
I moved in with her.

58:25.040 --> 58:26.999
That was my big mistake right there.

58:27.600 --> 58:30.799
I should have stuck with the plan.
The plan was working.

58:31.360 --> 58:34.839
The irony of it is that Bridget
actually loves plans.

58:35.280 --> 58:36.679
We used to go on these trips.

58:37.600 --> 58:41.519
She would plan everything
down to the very last detail.

58:41.920 --> 58:45.879
Including the gas station
that we were gonna stop at.

58:47.680 --> 58:49.079
I remember this one time,

58:50.080 --> 58:51.879
we were in Ashland, right?

58:52.360 --> 58:55.039
♪ Baby please don't go. ♪

58:55.120 --> 58:57.439

it was like torrential-downpour rain.

Did you buy the whole store?

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:45.999
Want some pie?

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.759

01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.719
Look at the moon.

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.599
Let's pull over.

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.519
- Did you love him?
- Peter?

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.119
No. Maybe a little.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.479
Do you love Bridget?

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.559
- I guess so.
- Do you or don't you?

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.199
I thought I did.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.679
If it wasn't love,
it was a lot like it.

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:45.199
Now I don't know. Sounds
stupid when I say it out loud.

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:50.199
If you're not willing to sound stupid,
you don't deserve to be in love.

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:54.719
- Take this.
- What?

01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.479
What was that?

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.679
- What?
- That.

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:04.959
I didn't hear anything.

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:07.959
Oh, my God!

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:13.159
Oh, my God.
Ollie, are you all right?

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.479
Okay, I'm freezing...

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.239
- Whoa, you just looked.
- No, I didn't.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.719
- You said you weren't gonna look.
- I didn't. Go.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.159
I looked.

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.519
- Looking good.
- Shut up.

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:42.279
Very nice.

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.439
You're just taking advantage of me,
come on!

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:49.479
Okay, the shutter's gonna stay open
for 40 seconds, keep still, okay?

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:50.879
Okay.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.559
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.999
It's cold.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:16.239
- Hi.
- No moving.

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:28.319
- You're moving.
- I can't help it.

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.719
Folks, can I talk to you
out here for a second?

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:36.519
Folks...

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.879
Folks, this is a national park.

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:03.359
Why don't you get back in your
clothes, back in your car

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:05.319
and back on the highway.

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:08.199
Have a nice day.

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.999
I've got to go.

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.239
Okay.

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:37.319
Anyway, we've got this big VC meeting
in New York.

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.879
Got to put on this big
dog and pony show.

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:44.919
- You know what VC is, right?
- No.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:50.039
It's venture capital.
It's like a big influx of cash,

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:54.919
to really help us grow our business.
- It sounds exciting.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:17.799
- I'll grab this.
- I got it.

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.599
Well...

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.639
You you've got my number.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.319
And you've got mine.

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:36.399
Yes, I do.

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:43.959
- I'll let you know how things go in New York.
- Yeah, good.

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.399
I've still got some...

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:56.319
feelings to sort through, about...

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.759
- Bridget?
- Yeah.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.959
I didn't forget.
It's Bridget.

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:06.359
- I... it's...
- It's okay.

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.999
- Is it?
- Yeah.

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.399
I met someone.

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:16.559
You met someone?

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:19.439
It's not like we're getting married
or anything, but...

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:22.679
Wait, I'm confused.

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.999
This is someone different?
Not the writer guy?

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.199
A different guy, a new guy.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:30.239
A different guy?

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:33.399
What?

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:38.399
I don't... You know, it's...

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:44.199
Thank you.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.519
So...

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.159
Don't.

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:05.519
You'll ruin it.

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:19.959
Get out of here, I'm sick of you!

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:38.599
Pitch and go, keep up the pace.
It's not a big deal. I'm sorry.

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:41.759
It actually is quite a big deal,
but don't go too fast.

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.719
You get really jittery
when you go fast.

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:46.319
Don't speed through the whole thing

01:08:46.479 --> 01:08:48.599
'cause nobody understands
what you're saying.

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:53.078
- We invested a lot of time...
- Jeety, I need you to shut up!

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.879
- This is exactly what I mean.
- You're driving me crazy.

01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.118
So...

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.158
the baby...

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.078
The...

01:09:08.359 --> 01:09:11.198
The client inputs the child's data

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:14.719
and the baby actually
tracks its growth.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:18.399
So when it's time
to move up to a bigger size...

01:09:21.279 --> 01:09:24.399
There it is.
Bam! Just on your doorstep.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.118
No hassle, no fuss.

01:09:29.279 --> 01:09:30.959
Does the baby have a name?

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.839
Does the baby have a name? Yes.

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:41.879
What were we saying
for the baby's name?

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.879
- Freddy.
- Freddy.

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:51.479
- Doesn't have to be Fred.
- Gabe was another choice we came up with.

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.759
Gabe the babe.

01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:01.199
My point is that there are
10,000 babies born every hour.

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:05.799
That's 254,000 babies a day.

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:09.519
And somebody's got to figure out
where to put all that shit.

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.919
I wanna be that guy.

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:21.559
10,000 babies an hour.
Wouldn't that be 240,000 babies a day?

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:30.719
Yes.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.359
It was good, Ollie.
You were great.

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:42.319
There was that one little thing,
but it wasn't a big deal.

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.159
How about you?
You think it was good?

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.039
It's mine.

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.279
- Hey, I'm Jeeter. How you doing?
- Hi.

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:52.639
- Hello?
- Ollie?

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:55.719
- Hi.
- Are you still in New York?

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.199
Yep. Can you hold on one second?
It's bad reception here.

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.439
Found it.

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:17.319
How does it look?

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:20.919
Looks good.

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:27.319
- She was young, huh?
- Yeah.

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.199
What kind of flowers
did you get?

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:36.319
Blue.

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.079
That's perfect.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.519
Today's her birthday.

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.319
Talk to me.

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:58.159
I don't know what to say.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.439
Doesn't matter.

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:06.399
All right.

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.959
There's...

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:16.239
There's this kid, okay?
And he's in his backyard

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:18.119
and he's digging a hole.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:25.199
And the neighbor lady
looks over the fence and says,

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:27.599
"What you doing over there,
little Johnny?"

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:32.999
The kid looks really sad
and he says, "My goldfish died,"

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:39.399
"so I'm having a funeral for it."
And the lady says,

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.959
"That's an awfully big hole
for a goldfish."

01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:45.199
And little Johnny says,

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.959
"That's because
he's inside your stupid cat."

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.679
You know, that's terrible.

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:05.239
Thank you.

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.959
Final call for flight 701
to Los Angeles.

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:23.039
This flight is now closing.

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:33.239
Excuse me, are you traveling with us
to Los Angeles, sir?

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:59.159
She lives in Los Angeles
and my work is in San Francisco, so...

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:06.599
That's... If this VC money comes in,
we're gonna be swamped anyway, so...

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:13.519
But it's like...
How can I be there for her

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:17.279
if I don't even have
my thing figured out? You know?

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.039
I can't.

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:24.239
I was clear with her
right from the top that...

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:28.439
The first day that we met
I told her that I had to have my things,

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:32.519
my work and stuff that...

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:43.479
So you won't be traveling with us
to Los Angeles then?

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:50.479
No.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.039
Okay.

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:16.999
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:18.639
- I'm Jeeter.
- I'm Natalie.

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:20.679
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you, too.

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:22.999
In about 24 hours
I'm gonna be rich.

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:25.759
- Really?
- Yeah. You from New York?

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:29.399
- No, I'm from LA.
- Okay. Did I mention I was gonna be rich?

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.999
- You did, actually.
- Yeah?    - You like that?

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:33.279
It's interesting.

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:36.319
Natalie, what would you do
with 6.2 million dollars?

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.479
- Should we check it?
- Check it.

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.039
Does it work?

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:52.559
There's a dial tone.

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.359
Maybe we should call them.

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:59.479
No. They said Friday afternoon.
It's still Friday afternoon.

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:01.559
It's not Friday afternoon
in New York.

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:04.559
- Seriously, we should call them.
- They'll call.

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:06.799
We don't wanna look desperate.

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:12.919
Hello? Diaper...

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:15.879
It's not... Which?

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:18.719
Hello? There.
Hello? Diaperush.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:20.799
This is Oliver speaking.

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:23.799
Yeah.

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.119
Right.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.999
Right. Okay, so...

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:37.079
We'll talk to you next week.

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.959
Thank you.

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.239
- We got it.
- We got it, baby!

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:54.719
We got it!

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:02.279
Yes!

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:19.839
That is one special lady.

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:22.959
I'm gonna miss her.

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.959
No one can say
we didn't try, right?

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.319
- Just need the keys.
- Yeah.

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:37.439
Hey, can I hang on to the key chain?

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:40.959
- They're, like, 25 bucks.
- You serious?

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:43.279
Yeah. Just keep it.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:46.319
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.439
You need a ride?

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.879
Just gonna clear some stuff
out of my office.

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:03.679
This was fun.

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:11.439
- Hey, you come to LA, give me a call.
- Yeah, definitely.

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.319
Does the artist ever come in here?

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:32.479
Most days.
You just missed her, actually.

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:11.399
Hi. Back again?

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:16.519
Yep.

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:50.959
Chris!

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:54.679
Not so far.
Just come back. There you go.

01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:02.119
You should get one.

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:05.079
That was the plan.

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:06.239
Instead,

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:08.239
I'm almost thirty,

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:10.359
unemployed,

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:12.639
and living with Mom and Dad.

01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:19.879
Oliver,

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:22.359
this is your life.

01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:23.999
Right now.

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:27.199

I know you like Bon Jovi, so...

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:32.879
I don't.

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:35.999
Emily...

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:38.799
I'm flat broke.

01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:43.959
I don't have a job.
I don't have a plan.

01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:47.479
And I know I'm...

01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:51.759
I know I'm probably
6 years too late,

01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.799
but will you give me strike one back?

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:03.679
You're married.

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:11.279
I'm engaged.

01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:19.119
Do you wanna come in?

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:25.599
No. I think I need the air.

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:32.599
I have to get the baby.
I'm sitting for Michelle.

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:37.359
You sound really good.

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:00.319
Well...

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:06.639
I guess when I'm an old man,
I'll never have to wonder,

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:10.119
"What if?".

01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:03.239
How long have you had
this place, Ben?

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:07.079
Going on 4 years,
but I still have a lot of plans for it.

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:10.079
I'm sure Em would be happy
to help you with those plans.

01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:11.639
I'm sure she will.

01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:11.599
This is a phase
I am glad you grew out of.

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:15.719
I don't even recognize you.
Oh, that skirt!

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:19.399
Those are great boots,
you still have those?

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:20.479
Not the boots.

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:22.119
What am I looking for here?
The guy?

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:24.479
- No, not the guy.
- Whatever happened to that guy?

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:27.639
The photos.
They're from before we met.

01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:30.359
- Before you and who met?
- Me and Oliver.

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:34.199
- What are you talking about?
- He took them before I even saw him,

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:36.599
so he did make the first move.

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:39.519
Kind of.

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:42.479
- You ready?
- I've got to go.

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.559
I'm gonna stop by tomorrow
to help you move.

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:46.999
- Where you going?
- Michael needs a new suit.

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:48.999
I can't let him shop alone.

01:28:58.320 --> 01:28:59.799
Tell me. Do I look fat?

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.879
Seriously. The pinstripes,
they make me look fat?

01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:05.199
This is the seventh suit
you've tried on today.

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.639
What should I say?
It's a suit.

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:11.399
- I need some give in the shoulders.
- Yeah, they do alterations. Move.

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.559
- Yeah.
- Shirts, huh?

01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:16.439
That's a nice shirt.
Look at this one.

01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:18.319
Shirts.

01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:20.359
Those legs,
they go all the way to the floor.

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:22.839
- Here.
- Socks. Yeah.

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:25.439
- About done here?
- Hold on now.

01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:29.359
We don't want our pants falling down
in the middle of "I do."

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:31.199
Nobody wants to see that.

01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:42.599
Thought you quit smoking.

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:46.279
I did.

01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:01.079
What's going on, Em?

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:14.239
What are you doing?

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:15.439
I'm hungry.

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:16.879
I don't care, you have to wait.

01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:18.079
- Mom!
- What?

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:20.519
- Have you seen my tie?
- Did you look in your room?

01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:23.839
- Yes. I don't know where it is.
- You better find it.

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:25.879
Is that my tie?

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:27.439
- Mom.
- What?

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:29.519
- Graham took my tie.
- Why did he take it?

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:32.279
I don't know.
Why? Give it to me.

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:36.279
Hi, I've tried this number all morning
and I wonder if you can find out

01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:39.239
if there's something wrong
with the line, if it's disconnected,

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:41.319
or if I can make
an emergency breakthrough.

01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:45.399
- She's sleeping.
- Okay. Thanks anyway.

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:47.159
Have you packed?
I brought the minivan.

01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:50.519
- I'm not moving.
- What's going on?

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:55.039
Ben and I broke up.

01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:57.639
Honey...

01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:00.079
Are you okay?

01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:03.519
Why didn't you call me?
What happened?

01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:05.519
I had to do this.

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:11.719
Okay. We are gonna sit down
and we are going to take a deep breath.

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:14.079
It's gonna be fine.

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:19.199
It is so natural to be nervous
before you get married. Remember me?

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:22.359
Don't worry,
Ben is gonna understand.

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:25.079
You just need to talk to him.
Just set a time to meet.

01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:27.119
Tell him you need a few days
to think it over.

01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:29.639
- I have to call Oliver.
- Oliver?

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:32.639
- Who doesn't have call waiting?
- Sweetie...

01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:35.119
I have to tell him
I'm not getting married.

01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:36.959
Stop. Give me the phone.

01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:40.519
- I saw him.
- You saw who?

01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:43.599
Oliver.

01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:46.919
Emily...

01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:49.799
he's getting married.

01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:54.519
When?

01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:08.079
Hi, I have a phone number
and I wonder

01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:10.599
if you could give me the address
that goes with it.

01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:11.799
What are you gonna say?

01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:14.199
That I broke it off with Ben.
Just the truth.

01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:16.599
No, I wasn't speaking to you, sorry.

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:19.119
Okay, you ready?
Here it is.

01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:22.079
I forgot the number.
Find the number.

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:24.759
- Hold on, I'm looking.
- She's looking.

01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:31.639
You look like shit.

01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:33.759
Thank you.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.039
Big day!

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:38.879
Are you ready, gentlemen?

01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:41.399
Ready? Yeah.

01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:44.719
- All right.
- Let's get started.

01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:14.479
Hello?

01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:44.279
Honey, are you okay?
Shall I call a doctor?

01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:46.959
I'll get somebody to help you.
Go get some help.

01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:50.159
Are you okay?

01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:53.439
- I got it. I got her.
- I'm sure there's a doctor...

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.279
- It's fine.
- Okay.

01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:58.559
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:02.399
- What are you doing here?
- I'm so sorry. I have to go.

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:04.199
Are you here with the ice?

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:07.479
How did you find me?

01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:11.119
I had your number, I called Information
and got your address.

01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:14.599
Wow. Information sure gives out
a lot of information.

01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:16.959
- I got this.
- All right.

01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:20.999
- Is your head okay?
- Ollie! We're waiting on you, son.

01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:22.359
Yes.

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:24.279
You should go.

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:26.399
I'm gonna go.

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:30.959
Oliver.

01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:33.999
Okay.

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:48.439
Emily...

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:01.559
It's too late. I'm too...

01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:07.799
Oliver!

01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:09.959
What's going on?

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:12.959
You're not too late.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.119
I'm not getting married,
my sister is.

01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:22.439
You're such a dick!

01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:31.599
Let's go. Let's start without him,
you guys. Come on.

01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:33.759
Don't.

01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:35.559
You'll ruin it.
