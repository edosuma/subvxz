WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:04.066
[Synclaire laughing]

00:06.100 --> 00:08.700
‐ Yeah. Here we are.
‐ Yay.

00:08.766 --> 00:10.666
Crossing the threshold
into the humble abode

00:10.733 --> 00:13.600
of Overton and Synclaire Jones,
the early years.

00:13.666 --> 00:16.800
‐ Mmm.
‐ Mmm.

00:16.866 --> 00:19.166
Man, come on.
Can you not do this every time?

00:19.233 --> 00:22.033
I'm luggin' 40 pounds
of trolls here.

00:22.100 --> 00:24.466
Alright, alright. Ease up, now.

00:24.533 --> 00:25.900
We're newlyweds.

00:25.966 --> 00:28.733
Facin' our brave,
new world together.

00:28.800 --> 00:32.232
Oh, stop the drama. You're down
one flight of stairs.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.866
(Trip)
'Ah.'

00:34.933 --> 00:36.800
‐ 'Hey!'
‐ Ooh.

00:37.433 --> 00:38.366
[grunting]

00:39.766 --> 00:41.500
You might wanna
wipe off his leg, uh..

00:41.566 --> 00:43.633
A dog got a little friendly
out in the alley.

00:43.700 --> 00:45.700
Oh, Trip, thank you so much
for pitching in.

00:45.766 --> 00:47.633
I take back all the nasty things
I said about you

00:47.700 --> 00:50.533
moving into my old room
and stealing all of my friends.

00:50.600 --> 00:51.866
My goodness.

00:51.933 --> 00:55.100
Oh, oh. I said that
behind your back, didn't I?

00:55.166 --> 00:56.400
Sorry.

00:56.466 --> 00:59.333
Oh God, this place
is depressing.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.306
Whoo, you sure
the old bag who lived here

01:01.373 --> 01:02.906
died of a heart attack?

01:02.973 --> 01:06.406
Maybe she just killed herself.
Ooh! Yuck.

01:06.473 --> 01:08.373
Hey, don't crack
on Miss Porchnick.

01:08.439 --> 01:09.873
Kinda hard keepin'
the house cheery

01:09.940 --> 01:11.873
when you're hooked up
to a iron lung.

01:14.406 --> 01:16.740
So this is how
Regine sees the world.

01:19.006 --> 01:20.640
Those are called feet, Max.

01:20.706 --> 01:22.973
Oh, you know,
those things that Kyle used

01:23.040 --> 01:24.906
to walk out of your life.

01:26.206 --> 01:28.540
Oh. Oh, and those feet
are just nasty.

02:07.713 --> 02:09.413
Now, what do you say,
we go down and hang

02:09.479 --> 02:12.946
with your buddy, Cedric Ceballos
and his long‐legged friends?

02:14.446 --> 02:16.280
‐ Oh, wow. Suns in town?
‐ Yes.

02:16.346 --> 02:18.213
Uh, Max, Kyle's gone a few weeks

02:18.279 --> 02:20.880
and already you are trampin'
around locker rooms?

02:20.946 --> 02:23.046
Have you no shame?
I'll answer that.

02:23.113 --> 02:25.680
Not a damn bit.

02:25.746 --> 02:28.780
Maxine Shaw
does not pine over the past.

02:28.846 --> 02:32.013
But if I can help you
satisfy your thing

02:32.080 --> 02:34.313
for Ced the teddy bear..

02:34.380 --> 02:35.646
...then everybody's the winner.

02:35.713 --> 02:38.346
What thing?
I don't have no thing.

02:38.413 --> 02:39.713
He is just a friend.

02:39.780 --> 02:42.346
A friend you flirt with
every time you interview him.

02:42.413 --> 02:43.913
I do not flirt with him.

02:43.980 --> 02:46.580
I just use my people skills
to get him to open up.

02:48.180 --> 02:50.413
Okay, it doesn't hurt that
I carry a little tape recorder

02:50.480 --> 02:52.946
in my cleave, you see..

02:53.013 --> 02:55.313
‐ Khadijah!
‐ What?

02:55.380 --> 02:58.313
God did not bless you
with boobage..

03:00.280 --> 03:03.620
...so that you could
carry office supplies.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.320
Girl, you better use
them things to get a date.

03:11.353 --> 03:14.053
Well, he is kind of sexy.

03:14.120 --> 03:17.686
I guess, I could, uh, approach
him about a follow‐up interview.

03:17.753 --> 03:19.986
Uh, no.
No, you will not, alright?

03:20.053 --> 03:21.386
That's the old Khadijah.

03:21.453 --> 03:22.853
Now, the new Khadijah

03:22.920 --> 03:26.086
needs to put down the notepad
and ask the brother out.

03:26.153 --> 03:28.020
The new Khadijah
needs to get some

03:28.086 --> 03:29.753
and tell us
all the dirty details.

03:31.886 --> 03:35.020
The new Khadijah sound like
a big‐mouthed hooker.

03:36.453 --> 03:37.986
(Max)
'Now, come on, Khadijah,
hurry up.'

03:38.053 --> 03:39.520
Gotta get in there before
they wash the sweat off.

03:39.586 --> 03:40.820
‐ Press.
‐ Alright.

03:40.886 --> 03:42.120
‐ Press.
‐ Alright.

03:42.186 --> 03:43.553
‐ Excuse me.
‐ Yes. Yes, sir.

03:43.620 --> 03:45.953
This looks like
a video rental card.

03:47.286 --> 03:50.220
Excuse me,
this is my writing partner.

03:50.286 --> 03:51.820
And I'm not goin'
in that room without her.

03:51.886 --> 03:53.953
The exit is to the left.

03:54.986 --> 03:56.786
See you later, Max.

03:56.853 --> 03:58.920
Oh, w‐w‐wait, oh..

03:58.986 --> 04:00.053
(Cedric)
'Oh, I knew we had the game won'

04:00.120 --> 04:01.426
when I saw Spike Lee courtside

04:01.493 --> 04:03.026
crying in his popcorn.

04:03.093 --> 04:04.793
So you're happy with the win
even though

04:04.860 --> 04:06.893
you didn't score
a single free throw all night?

04:06.960 --> 04:09.893
Oh, you'll have to excuse me.
My coach just arrived.

04:11.860 --> 04:14.960
Hiya, girl.
How you doin'?

04:15.026 --> 04:17.593
You here for some interviews or
just peep out a little flesh?

04:17.660 --> 04:20.160
[sighs]
Um, little bit of both.

04:20.226 --> 04:21.959
Hmm, well, I'm available
for a little

04:22.026 --> 04:23.660
one‐on‐one tomorrow night.

04:23.726 --> 04:25.960
Alright, well, how about dinner?

04:26.026 --> 04:28.660
Khadijah James,
did you just ask me out?

04:28.726 --> 04:30.060
Depends. You sayin' yes?

04:30.126 --> 04:32.526
Umm, yeah, if you're askin'.

04:32.593 --> 04:34.059
Alright.

04:34.126 --> 04:35.526
And just make sure
you wear that.

04:35.593 --> 04:37.059
Okay.

04:38.759 --> 04:40.393
Now you still have
that little crazy roommate?

04:40.460 --> 04:42.526
The one who had me sign
that Styrofoam wig‐head.

04:42.593 --> 04:44.093
‐ Oh.
‐ 'What was her name?

04:44.160 --> 04:46.626
‐ Max.
‐ That's Regine.

04:46.693 --> 04:49.160
Max is the sweet one.

04:49.226 --> 04:52.160
Oh, hello.
Oh, okay, wait a minute.

04:52.226 --> 04:54.493
[laughing]
Hey, partner.

04:55.926 --> 04:58.160
(male #1)
'Ow!'

04:58.226 --> 05:00.766
Well, if you don't like it,
cowboy, snap me back.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.500
[knock on door]

05:05.433 --> 05:07.733
Oh, hello.
I'm looking for Mary Porchnick.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.800
She does live here, doesn't she?

05:09.866 --> 05:11.866
Lives?

05:11.933 --> 05:13.866
Uh, uh, uh..

05:15.166 --> 05:17.966
Well, well‐well,
my name is Mr‐Mr. McLay.

05:18.033 --> 05:20.366
I'm a, I'm a friend of hers.

05:20.433 --> 05:23.166
‐ Is she up and about?
‐ Well, uh..

05:23.233 --> 05:26.933
Uh, uh, well,
she‐she‐she's‐she's moved on.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.066
M‐moving, moving, m‐moving on.

05:29.133 --> 05:30.866
Uh, wh‐wh‐where to?

05:32.200 --> 05:34.800
A better place.

05:34.866 --> 05:38.466
Oh, fiddlesticks. I'm‐I'm only
in town for a couple of days.

05:38.533 --> 05:40.666
And I‐I‐I'm desperate
to see her.

05:40.733 --> 05:43.766
Uh, will she,
will she be around later?

05:43.833 --> 05:46.300
In one form or another.

05:46.366 --> 05:48.500
Oh, tha‐thank you.
Uh, I‐I'll be back.

05:48.566 --> 05:51.600
And, uh, don't tell her.

05:51.666 --> 05:55.633
The old bird
just loves surprises.

05:55.700 --> 05:57.833
And she got
a pretty good one last month.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.573
Oh, yeah. Oh, buh‐bye.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.140
Uh, who was that, babe?

06:03.206 --> 06:05.073
Obie, it was this sweet old man.

06:05.140 --> 06:07.373
He was, he was looking
for Mary Porchnick.

06:07.440 --> 06:08.373
‐ Oh.
‐ Oh..

06:08.440 --> 06:09.606
A‐a‐and I think I gave him

06:09.673 --> 06:10.673
the impression that she was

06:10.740 --> 06:12.973
living and breathing
and would be here later.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.473
Oh. Oh, my.

06:15.540 --> 06:16.940
Well, uh, don't fret, baby.

06:17.006 --> 06:19.540
Uh, when he comes back,
I'll break the news to him.

06:19.606 --> 06:21.940
See, look here, girl.
We're a team now.

06:22.006 --> 06:23.406
And if one of us
fumbles the ball

06:23.473 --> 06:26.140
the other one picks it up,
runs it to the end zone

06:26.206 --> 06:29.273
and does the victory dance
in front of the whole dog pound.

06:29.340 --> 06:31.140
Hm.

06:31.206 --> 06:33.640
You still miss the Browns,
don't you?

06:33.706 --> 06:35.706
Like a toddler
misses the nipple.

06:43.506 --> 06:45.040
(Synclaire)
Okay!

06:45.106 --> 06:47.373
Cinderella's ready for the ball.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.773
[chuckles]
Cinderella's havin'
second thoughts

06:49.840 --> 06:53.173
about these
nose bleed stilettos.

06:53.240 --> 06:56.673
Nose bleeds go away.
Loneliness is forever.

06:58.173 --> 07:00.040
He's not even gonna
see my feet anyway.

07:00.106 --> 07:01.380
He's gonna be too busy
lookin' at this

07:01.446 --> 07:04.046
sweat moustache
over my upper lip.

07:04.113 --> 07:06.580
Just keep dabbin' it
with the bread. You'll be fine.

07:09.113 --> 07:10.980
What is wrong with me?

07:11.046 --> 07:12.913
Oh, Khadijah,
you look beautiful.

07:12.980 --> 07:14.346
Why are you so nervous?

07:14.413 --> 07:16.146
I'll tell you why.

07:16.213 --> 07:18.213
Old girl is out of practice.

07:18.280 --> 07:21.080
Hasn't had
a serious date in months.

07:21.146 --> 07:23.580
Regine, you been
tellin' my business?

07:23.646 --> 07:27.013
Khadijah, men have a sixth sense
about this sort of thing.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.713
I mean, we can feel
the desperation.

07:29.780 --> 07:31.713
And I gotta tell you,
it's a real turn off.

07:33.046 --> 07:34.280
‐ What?
‐ Alright, that's it.

07:34.346 --> 07:35.313
I'm not goin'.

07:35.380 --> 07:37.813
Let's get
somethin' straight, Ira.

07:37.880 --> 07:41.446
You are a man
living with women. Okay?

07:41.513 --> 07:44.780
There'll be moments
when you really don't belong.

07:46.713 --> 07:49.413
This is two of those moments
put together.

07:49.480 --> 07:50.580
Oh, I‐I understand.

07:50.646 --> 07:52.880
You know, I‐I grew up with,
uh, three sisters.

07:52.946 --> 07:54.846
I mean, you know, so let me
go on and get up out of here

07:54.913 --> 07:58.546
before one of y'all start
chasin' me with a hot comb.

07:58.613 --> 08:00.720
Look, when Cedric gets here,
why don't you just tell him

08:00.786 --> 08:03.086
that I slipped in the tub
and I broke my ankle.

08:03.153 --> 08:04.686
It's just a date.

08:04.753 --> 08:06.686
It does not have to end
with a picket fence

08:06.753 --> 08:09.086
and a freakin' dog
in your backyard, alright?

08:09.153 --> 08:10.320
Come on.

08:10.386 --> 08:12.320
For once in your life,
loosen up.

08:12.386 --> 08:14.420
Relax. Have some fun.

08:16.486 --> 08:18.753
Well, my head hurts
and I gotta vomit.

08:20.220 --> 08:21.486
Alright, I'll get you
some aspirin

08:21.553 --> 08:23.386
and a bucket, you big sissy.

08:24.486 --> 08:25.986
Come on, honey,
now you sit down.

08:26.053 --> 08:28.153
It's okay. You sit down.

08:28.220 --> 08:29.386
Now, look.

08:29.453 --> 08:32.620
If anybody should be nervous,
it's him.

08:32.686 --> 08:35.053
You are Khadijah James.

08:35.120 --> 08:38.553
You are different than
any other woman he's ever dated.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.120
That's true.

08:42.186 --> 08:45.286
I'm not 19, I'm not a model
and I'm not famous.

08:46.820 --> 08:50.386
Oh, Khadijah. Listen.

08:50.453 --> 08:52.720
Just let nature
take its course.

08:54.486 --> 08:56.620
Look at me and Obie,
it worked for us.

08:56.686 --> 08:58.920
It took over a year and a half
just to get up the nerve

08:58.986 --> 09:00.926
to ask you to the flea market.

09:02.460 --> 09:04.126
Good point,
stick your tongue in his throat

09:04.193 --> 09:06.126
the minute you see him, girl.

09:09.526 --> 09:10.626
Alright, how many do you want?

09:10.693 --> 09:11.793
Two will be fine.

09:11.860 --> 09:13.493
[knocking on door]

09:13.560 --> 09:15.226
Okay, give me two more.

09:15.293 --> 09:17.426
Give me four.
Come on, hurry now. Hurry up.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.860
Mr. Ceballos.

09:23.093 --> 09:24.760
Well, hello.

09:24.826 --> 09:26.493
I'm Synclaire. Remember me?

09:26.560 --> 09:27.860
Why don't you
just come right on in?

09:27.926 --> 09:29.393
Oh, look at me.
I can't invite you in.

09:29.460 --> 09:30.593
I don't live here anymore.

09:30.660 --> 09:32.293
But uninviting you in
would be rude.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.193
Pretend I was never here. Okay.

09:35.526 --> 09:37.093
‐ I'm sorry. Forgive me.
‐ That's alright.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.126
I kinda expect
that from your friends.

09:39.193 --> 09:41.926
Oh, so then you
must remember Max and Regine.

09:41.993 --> 09:43.393
We're getting late,
Antonio's not gonna hold

09:43.460 --> 09:45.393
those reservations, come on.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.293
[laughing]

09:52.226 --> 09:55.293
Hey, umm, wh‐wh‐what are you
doin' with that bottle?

09:55.360 --> 09:57.326
Well, I was going
to get the aspirin

09:57.393 --> 09:59.960
but this one said "For Regine's
professional use only"

10:00.026 --> 10:02.200
so I figured that
this was the good stuff..

10:02.266 --> 10:04.066
...that you were holdin' out
for yourself.

10:05.466 --> 10:08.366
Max, I keep my herbal
tranquilizers in that bottle.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.866
Tranquillizers.

10:11.933 --> 10:13.666
I offer them to my brides.

10:13.733 --> 10:14.866
Half if they're nervous

10:14.933 --> 10:16.866
and a whole one
if their husbands are ugly.

10:18.666 --> 10:21.266
I just gave Khadijah
four ugly husbands' worth.

10:22.666 --> 10:25.300
Ow, girl, why didn't
you just knock the girl

10:25.366 --> 10:27.266
on the head
with a baseball bat?

10:27.333 --> 10:29.033
We better get
to that restaurant.

10:29.100 --> 10:31.066
[mumbling]

10:32.366 --> 10:33.566
Where you goin'?

10:33.633 --> 10:36.166
Oh, you don't expect me
to go to Antonio's

10:36.233 --> 10:38.166
wearin' these rags, do you?

10:42.800 --> 10:45.266
[harp music]

10:45.333 --> 10:46.933
I can't believe
I'm sittin' across the table

10:47.000 --> 10:50.466
from Khadijah James and she's
not scribblin' on her notepad.

10:50.533 --> 10:51.800
Well, how do you know
I'm not hidin'

10:51.866 --> 10:54.500
a tape recorder somewhere?

10:54.566 --> 10:56.966
I see somebody tryin'
to get their flirt on.

10:57.033 --> 10:58.333
Well. Hey.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.540
You know, all work and no play
makes Khadijah..

11:04.406 --> 11:06.206
Wow!

11:10.540 --> 11:13.306
Did somebody
dim the lights in here?

11:13.373 --> 11:16.173
Hmm, I don't think so.
Are you alright?

11:16.240 --> 11:18.840
Mm, maybe I just need some food.

11:20.973 --> 11:22.906
How about a toast?

11:24.540 --> 11:28.406
To Ced, and of course to..

11:30.040 --> 11:31.406
Umm..

11:32.906 --> 11:35.773
Hey, that's funny
I can't remember my name.

11:37.473 --> 11:40.940
‐ Yeah.
‐ Good evening, name please.

11:41.006 --> 11:42.673
Oops.

11:45.373 --> 11:46.606
Thank you.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.606
Yes, we are joining
the Kitsan party.

11:48.673 --> 11:50.173
[whispering]
Kitsan, Kitsan.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.740
Right this way.

11:52.806 --> 11:56.340
Alright. Smooth move, you've
done this before, haven't you?

11:56.406 --> 11:59.073
Oh, Chuck E. Cheese.
Private party. I was six.

12:00.613 --> 12:03.013
Your table, ladies.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.546
[speaking in foreign language]

12:05.613 --> 12:09.046
Oh. This is great.

12:09.113 --> 12:11.113
Girl, where the hell
did you pick that up from?

12:11.180 --> 12:14.246
Baby Hannah's private party.
I was twelve.

12:14.313 --> 12:16.446
My doctor said my left foot

12:16.513 --> 12:18.513
is bigger than my right foot.

12:18.580 --> 12:20.913
Right? See? Now feet big.

12:20.980 --> 12:23.346
Why are my shoes the same size?

12:24.246 --> 12:27.013
You see what I'm sayin'?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.913
[cell phone ringing]

12:28.980 --> 12:30.146
Your purse.

12:30.213 --> 12:32.780
Oh, man, listen..

12:34.913 --> 12:36.880
Hello, I'm at dinner.

12:36.946 --> 12:38.480
(Max)
'Khadijah, it's Max.'

12:38.546 --> 12:40.980
Get your butt in the coat room.
We've gotta talk to you.

12:41.046 --> 12:43.780
Okay.

12:43.846 --> 12:46.380
Okay, look,
I gotta go talk to the coat.

12:47.546 --> 12:50.080
Ced, will you
just watch my shoes, okay?

12:53.480 --> 12:56.146
Hello, lady,
your hair look nice like that.

13:01.186 --> 13:04.486
Now, you know that's nasty.
I could tell by the way you eat.

13:04.553 --> 13:06.686
You're hardly eating.

13:09.253 --> 13:10.886
Okay.

13:10.953 --> 13:13.686
‐ Oh, Khadijah.
‐ Oh, my God.

13:13.753 --> 13:14.886
Wait, no, hold up.

13:14.953 --> 13:16.186
Now, they could've got y'all

13:16.253 --> 13:18.486
a better table than this.

13:18.553 --> 13:19.953
Alright, Khadijah,
Khadijah, Khadijah.

13:20.020 --> 13:21.486
Listen, I have to
tell you something

13:21.553 --> 13:24.486
and I want to preface
this by saying

13:24.553 --> 13:27.286
Regine didn't mean to hurt you.

13:28.386 --> 13:31.853
‐ Khadijah, Max drugged you.
‐ No‐‐

13:31.920 --> 13:32.853
‐ She.. Shut up.
‐ Okay.

13:32.920 --> 13:36.120
She gave you tranquillizers.

13:36.186 --> 13:37.453
Okay, you shut
your hole, midget.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.753
I mean, it was an accident.
It was an accident.

13:39.820 --> 13:42.520
You know tranquillizers,
Aspirins. To‐ma‐to, to‐mah‐to.

13:42.586 --> 13:44.286
No, y'all is trippin'.

13:44.353 --> 13:45.453
Oh.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.986
You think I don't know.
I know what's up.

13:48.886 --> 13:50.853
I know!

13:50.920 --> 13:52.953
Y'all just tryin' to be jealous.

13:53.020 --> 13:56.453
See, 'cause I'm gettin'
the man of your dreams.

13:56.520 --> 13:59.220
Okay, honey, honey,
if we were lyin'

13:59.286 --> 14:01.926
why is your size 12
on the table?

14:07.060 --> 14:09.393
Now, see,
I'm goin' back over to my table.

14:09.460 --> 14:11.593
Because my man is missin' me.

14:13.960 --> 14:17.960
M‐m‐my m‐m‐man m‐m‐missin' m‐me.

14:19.493 --> 14:22.193
That's a lot of M's in that.

14:22.260 --> 14:23.626
‐ I like M's. M's..
‐ O‐o‐okay, hold on.

14:23.693 --> 14:24.660
We should be goin' home.

14:24.726 --> 14:25.826
[clamoring]

14:25.893 --> 14:28.560
Back off y'all.
Back off, back off.

14:28.626 --> 14:30.626
Get off of me.

14:32.960 --> 14:35.493
Hey, y'all just
stay the hell away from me.

14:35.560 --> 14:38.160
Imma call security.

14:38.226 --> 14:40.160
Security.

14:42.960 --> 14:46.293
Okay. Well, so much
for your brilliant plan.

14:46.360 --> 14:49.226
I am going over there and I'm
telling Cedric what's goin' on.

14:49.293 --> 14:53.326
Pardon me, Mr. Ceballos did not
come to world famous Antonio's

14:53.393 --> 14:56.360
to be harassed
by common groupies.

14:56.426 --> 14:59.426
Groupies, uh,
th‐there's that word again.

14:59.493 --> 15:02.166
I got your.. Wa‐wa‐wait.

15:02.233 --> 15:03.866
‐ You don't wanna..
‐ Oh, wait! Wait a minute.

15:03.933 --> 15:06.366
‐ You don't wanna do this.
‐ Unhand me, you brute!

15:07.133 --> 15:09.066
I really like that.

15:11.733 --> 15:13.933
Well, I was cold.

15:17.533 --> 15:19.600
Oh, wingtips. Mr. McLay.

15:19.666 --> 15:22.400
Alright, look, bad news
is best delivered straight.

15:22.466 --> 15:23.933
Just like whiskey.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.033
Well, what if Mrs. Porchnick
was his one true love

15:26.100 --> 15:27.866
and he's travelled here
to find her?

15:27.933 --> 15:29.633
What if
"no mountains high enough

15:29.700 --> 15:30.866
"no valleys low enough

15:30.933 --> 15:33.900
no rivers wide enough"
to keep him away from her, yeah?

15:33.966 --> 15:35.600
What if he touched her
in the morning, I mean..

15:35.666 --> 15:37.566
'What's goin' on here?'

15:37.633 --> 15:40.000
No more Miss Ross
before bedtime. Okay?

15:44.066 --> 15:45.666
Hi, Mr. McLay.

15:45.733 --> 15:47.533
My husband, Overton,
has something to tell you. Come.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.633
Oh, don't tell me
Mary's not here again.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.733
That woman's
a, a whirling dervish.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.700
When I got back
from World War II

15:53.766 --> 15:55.800
it was months
before I found her.

15:55.866 --> 15:57.466
Oh, oh, so you were
in the big one, huh?

15:57.533 --> 15:58.500
‐ Yes.
‐ Yeah.

15:58.566 --> 16:00.006
I‐I bet you
learned to look death

16:00.073 --> 16:01.406
right in the eye
and laugh at it.

16:01.473 --> 16:02.706
‐ Ha!
‐ Never.

16:02.773 --> 16:06.273
Each loss is much more
painful than the last.

16:06.340 --> 16:10.106
Umm, well, Mrs. Porchnick'll
be back in the mornin'. Eh‐eh..

16:10.173 --> 16:12.006
Oh, my God, that‐that woman's

16:12.073 --> 16:14.373
harder to trace down
than a ghost.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.306
N‐n‐now you're gettin' it.

16:17.373 --> 16:21.106
Overton, if I fumble
and you fumble

16:21.173 --> 16:23.573
who picks up the ball?

16:23.640 --> 16:25.673
I guess we're gonna
have to have some kids, baby.

16:25.740 --> 16:28.673
We need a few more players
on this squad.

16:31.606 --> 16:34.206
My nana used to grate cheese
just like that.

16:37.740 --> 16:39.606
Oh, nana.

16:39.673 --> 16:42.373
[sobbing]

16:42.440 --> 16:44.940
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:45.006 --> 16:46.073
When did she pass?

16:46.140 --> 16:48.140
She's not dead, she in Jersey.

16:50.106 --> 16:52.006
Hey, what's wrong?
I kill your buzz?

16:52.073 --> 16:53.173
Well, come on.

16:53.240 --> 16:56.673
Come on. Let's dance,
Ced‐a‐doodle.

16:56.740 --> 16:58.273
They don't got
no dance floor here.

16:58.340 --> 17:01.313
Oh, please. Come on, now.

17:02.613 --> 17:05.445
Excuse me, harp lady.

17:05.512 --> 17:07.613
How about a little Wu Tang?

17:09.480 --> 17:11.413
How about a little Bach?

17:11.480 --> 17:13.813
Okay, kick it.

17:13.880 --> 17:16.813
[harp music]

17:18.546 --> 17:22.445
Khadijah, I think
it's time to take you home.

17:22.512 --> 17:24.380
Take me home?

17:24.445 --> 17:26.613
[chuckling]
Oh‐oh‐oh, somebody got

17:26.680 --> 17:29.380
a little crush on me, huh.

17:29.446 --> 17:31.213
Somebody need to sober up.

17:31.280 --> 17:33.013
Oh, please.

17:33.080 --> 17:36.680
Big guy like you..
Holdin' your liquor just fine.

17:44.346 --> 17:46.646
Okay, alright, I got it.

17:46.713 --> 17:48.880
What if I dress up
like Mrs. Porchnick?

17:48.946 --> 17:50.713
Then Mr. McLay will think that

17:50.780 --> 17:52.980
the woman he loves
is still alive.

17:53.046 --> 17:55.313
Now, was her hump
on the left or on the right?

17:56.613 --> 17:58.546
Look, baby, we can't
run from this forever.

17:58.613 --> 18:01.186
I mean, let's just face the man
like two mature adults, okay?

18:01.253 --> 18:02.220
[knock on door]

18:02.286 --> 18:03.786
‐ That's him. Hide.
‐ Hide.

18:03.853 --> 18:05.286
(Max)
'I know you're in there.'

18:05.353 --> 18:07.720
'Stop sneakin' that freak
and come open the door.'

18:08.686 --> 18:11.620
‐ It's Maxine.
‐ Yeah, thanks.

18:11.686 --> 18:14.053
Khadijah's got a hangover
and I gotta get some stuff

18:14.120 --> 18:15.720
to help her out, you know.

18:20.753 --> 18:22.153
Wait a minute, now.

18:22.220 --> 18:24.886
How's all that food
gonna help Khadijah's hangover?

18:24.953 --> 18:27.753
I'm much less abrasive
when I'm full.

18:27.820 --> 18:29.620
How many people live here?

18:29.686 --> 18:32.853
Uh, where can I
find Mary Porchnick?

18:32.920 --> 18:35.153
Got a shovel?

18:35.220 --> 18:37.786
That old prune
croaked weeks ago.

18:37.853 --> 18:39.286
Alright, y'all.
Thanks for the beef.

18:39.353 --> 18:41.253
(Obie)
'Alright.'

18:41.320 --> 18:42.753
Mary's dead?

18:42.820 --> 18:46.220
Sorry, Mr. McLay. We just
didn't know how to tell you.

18:46.286 --> 18:47.953
Woo‐woo‐woo.

18:49.386 --> 18:53.453
Mary's gone on to a fine
resting place at Pristine Hills.

18:53.520 --> 18:55.253
Her memory will live on forever.

18:55.320 --> 18:57.686
Oh, to Hades with her memory.

18:57.753 --> 19:01.293
That cheap old bag
owes me 500 bucks.

19:02.760 --> 19:03.926
‐ What?
‐ Yeah.

19:03.993 --> 19:05.260
She, she stiffed me

19:05.326 --> 19:08.360
a‐at a poker game ten years ago.

19:08.426 --> 19:10.793
I‐I'm half a mind to kill myself

19:10.860 --> 19:12.793
and get her on the other side.

19:16.326 --> 19:19.760
Last night was the most
humiliatin' night of my life.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.560
Do you think he'll call?

19:21.626 --> 19:23.893
Yeah, sure, girl.
I don't see why not.

19:26.493 --> 19:29.460
[chuckles]
What world are y'all livin' in?

19:29.526 --> 19:31.960
I mean, that brother
is never callin' again.

19:32.026 --> 19:34.160
I mean, I wouldn't be surprised
if he hasn't changed

19:34.226 --> 19:36.160
his phone number already.

19:39.760 --> 19:42.593
You are a first‐class
pain in the butt.

19:44.060 --> 19:47.026
I mean, ha‐ha‐have you ever
heard of a little thing

19:47.093 --> 19:49.260
called sparing
someone's feelings?

19:49.326 --> 19:50.993
But, uh, I‐I just did.

19:51.060 --> 19:53.760
I mean, I could've mentioned
how he's probably on the phone

19:53.826 --> 19:56.460
right now callin' up all
his NBA buddies and tellin' 'em

19:56.526 --> 19:58.793
how Khadijah James
do up on the maitre d'.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.933
Well, fine.
The truth is leavin' the room.

20:05.033 --> 20:07.400
[groans]

20:07.466 --> 20:09.866
Oh, forget Mars.

20:09.933 --> 20:12.500
That one is from Pluto.

20:12.566 --> 20:14.333
Well, at least he's
being straight with me.

20:14.400 --> 20:17.166
If this is what happens
when I put myself out there..

20:17.233 --> 20:19.966
I drink so much,
I don't even remember doin' it.

20:21.300 --> 20:22.266
Well, no more.

20:22.333 --> 20:23.833
Hey, cut yourself a break, girl.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.433
You didn't drink anything.

20:25.500 --> 20:28.233
It was those tranquillizers
that did you in.

20:28.300 --> 20:29.666
What tranquillizers?

20:31.366 --> 20:32.900
[grunts]

20:35.833 --> 20:38.933
You're right, girl.
You were pretty drunk.

20:41.500 --> 20:42.966
Oh, hold up, hold up.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.800
It's all comin' back to me now.

20:44.866 --> 20:47.233
That was your face
under the raccoon coat.

20:47.300 --> 20:48.800
Y'all drugged me.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.666
Is that really relevant?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.466
The important thing is..

20:55.533 --> 20:58.333
Is that you're back
in the dating game.

20:58.400 --> 20:59.466
Okay?

20:59.533 --> 21:02.073
Oh, I'm gettin' into it,
just without your help.

21:02.140 --> 21:04.273
Because for a few minutes
last night

21:04.340 --> 21:06.606
before the headache
and the sweating

21:06.673 --> 21:10.773
and the sudden coma,
I was really into it.

21:10.840 --> 21:12.840
I mean, that boy was cute.

21:12.906 --> 21:14.773
Khadijah, is there anything

21:14.840 --> 21:17.640
anything Max can do
to make this up to you?

21:18.606 --> 21:19.606
Yeah.

21:19.673 --> 21:22.406
You can call Cedric
and explain everything.

21:22.473 --> 21:24.640
Maybe at least
I can get my dignity back.

21:25.973 --> 21:27.606
And maybe another date.

21:27.673 --> 21:30.240
(Trip)
'That's a big, fat maybe!'

21:33.540 --> 21:35.640
Okay, we gotta teach
that brother how to lie.

21:40.873 --> 21:41.873
Now, hold on.

21:41.940 --> 21:43.906
Just take it easy
on Mrs. Porchnick.

21:43.973 --> 21:46.640
It's not easy to keep a house
cheery when you luggin' around

21:46.706 --> 21:47.773
a oxygen tank.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.773
Come on, lighten up
on Mrs. Porchnick.

21:49.840 --> 21:51.606
It's not easy
to keep a house cheery

21:51.673 --> 21:53.573
when the Grim Reaper's
at your doorstep.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.973
Come on now, don't‐don't
crack on Mrs. Porchnick.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.840
It's not easy
to keep a house cheery

21:57.906 --> 21:59.780
when you're fallin'
and you can't get up.

21:59.846 --> 22:01.813
Hey, don't crack on
Mrs. Porchnick.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.346
Kinda hard keepin'
the house cheery

22:03.413 --> 22:05.380
when you hooked up
to a iron lung.

22:07.046 --> 22:08.480
Y'all‐y'all got
to give me some love.

22:08.546 --> 22:11.013
Hey, I got the bat.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.680
<i>(female #1)</i>
<i>Woo‐hoo!</i>
