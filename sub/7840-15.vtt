00:30.542 --> 00:34.567
Okay, everyone,
straight ahead is my big surprise.

00:38.714 --> 00:39.998
Look out for the stairs.

00:40.033 --> 00:44.021
Whoa! Ooh.

00:47.002 --> 00:49.597
You redid the basement!

00:49.598 --> 00:53.120
Whoa... feel the pile
on this shag!

00:53.121 --> 00:55.410
Whoa, baby!

00:55.411 --> 00:57.160
Will you look
at that paneling?

00:57.161 --> 00:59.874
I feel like I'm back
in wooden times!

00:59.875 --> 01:01.560
Check out this pinball machine!

01:01.574 --> 01:03.641
"Chevy Chase in Foul Play."

01:03.643 --> 01:04.531
Pinball, eh?

01:04.531 --> 01:06.109
I've always wanted to try this.

01:08.159 --> 01:10.062
Wow, the graphics are amazing.

01:10.065 --> 01:12.102
That ball almost seems real!

01:12.177 --> 01:15.690
This basement is a wonderful
gift to the family.

01:15.697 --> 01:17.402
But how could you afford it?

01:17.418 --> 01:19.033
Marge, we're not going to have

01:19.037 --> 01:21.551
to worry about money ever again,

01:21.556 --> 01:24.270
because I've got a plan.

01:24.346 --> 01:26.830
I'd like to declare
bankruptcy, please.

01:27.058 --> 01:29.991
Mr. Simpson, do you understand
how bankruptcy works ?

01:30.005 --> 01:33.020
Yes I do. Under Chapter 13
of the fiscal code,

01:33.025 --> 01:34.051
an individual whose debts

01:34.065 --> 01:36.451
exceed his assets may
file for bankruptcy,

01:36.456 --> 01:39.163
thus protecting said assets.

01:39.206 --> 01:41.553
That was the old bankruptcy law.

01:41.567 --> 01:42.180
Huh?

01:42.195 --> 01:43.922
Under the new law, you have to

01:43.926 --> 01:45.792
pay your creditors everything.

01:45.798 --> 01:46.813
What the...? But I thought

01:46.816 --> 01:48.812
bankruptcy was the cool law!

01:48.817 --> 01:50.353
The one that says "Dude, don't

01:50.356 --> 01:52.330
worry about it. I got this."

01:52.518 --> 01:53.370
Mr. Simpson,

01:53.557 --> 01:55.242
I'm afraid this court
must appoint

01:55.247 --> 01:57.161
a financial officer to supervise

01:57.167 --> 01:58.952
repayment of your debts.

01:59.506 --> 02:00.343
Hmm...

02:00.347 --> 02:01.372
Permission to moan?

02:01.377 --> 02:02.410
I'll allow it.

02:07.658 --> 02:09.310
Mr. Simpson, among the expenses

02:09.316 --> 02:10.660
the court deems frivolous,

02:10.676 --> 02:13.090
you throw over $1,000 a month

02:13.097 --> 02:14.661
into local wishing wells.

02:14.688 --> 02:16.773
Of course, you idiot,

02:16.776 --> 02:18.843
'cause I'm wishing
for more money.

02:18.945 --> 02:19.481
Hm-hmm.

02:19.528 --> 02:20.702
Well, you're gonna have to make

02:20.705 --> 02:21.880
some serious cutbacks

02:21.897 --> 02:22.890
to your expenses.

02:22.897 --> 02:24.990
Three subscriptions
to Vanity Fair?

02:24.997 --> 02:27.203
I've got three bathrooms,
don't I?

02:27.217 --> 02:29.210
$500 a month

02:29.218 --> 02:30.762
to Totalpoker.com?

02:30.767 --> 02:31.733
Shut up!

02:31.735 --> 02:33.912
It's an instructional website!

02:33.917 --> 02:35.143
Shut up!

02:35.145 --> 02:37.430
Give it here, I'll
find some fat we can trim.

02:37.437 --> 02:39.102
Ah, here you go...

02:39.118 --> 02:41.653
a giant useless expense for something

02:41.655 --> 02:43.403
that no one is interested in.

02:46.158 --> 02:48.201
I don't want to leave!

02:48.206 --> 02:50.461
You promised me I could die here!

02:50.465 --> 02:52.620
No, no. This place is too expensive.

02:52.636 --> 02:57.111
I saw you doing a 500-piece jigsaw puzzle in there.

03:04.208 --> 03:06.751
Come on, Dad, I'm cutting back everywhere.

03:06.755 --> 03:09.460
To save gas, I'm Flintstone-ing the car.

03:12.795 --> 03:14.912
So... very...

03:27.665 --> 03:29.553
Scram, you two!

03:29.557 --> 03:31.282
This is my bedroom now!

03:31.286 --> 03:33.322
No way, this is our rec room!

03:33.325 --> 03:35.853
Not anymore.I already put my posters up.

03:35.858 --> 03:37.102

03:50.258 --> 03:52.272
Hey, Mr. Flanders,what'd you get?

03:52.276 --> 03:53.732
Some kind of bible garbage?

03:53.748 --> 03:54.841
Oh, I wish!

03:54.845 --> 03:57.433
No, these are complimentary boxes from the shipping company.

03:57.436 --> 03:59.041
Could a kid like me get these boxes,

03:59.046 --> 04:00.542
then use them for whatever he wanted?

04:00.996 --> 04:02.223
Only if he fibbed about

04:02.225 --> 04:05.621
his name, age, and occupation on this automated 800 number.

04:05.627 --> 04:07.460
Why don't you put this box by
your phone so you

04:07.466 --> 04:08.881
don't call the number by accident.

04:08.885 --> 04:10.361
Oh, I won't.

04:14.926 --> 04:18.310
Nothing like un-tossing a leftover salad.

04:18.327 --> 04:19.690
It'll be like new!

04:21.708 --> 04:24.910
Whoa.What the heck are these?

04:24.915 --> 04:26.780
Those are my medical samples!

04:26.787 --> 04:29.232
Hands off, you big blue Buttinski!

04:30.835 --> 04:32.852
Blood, bile, spinal fluid,

04:32.858 --> 04:34.442
blood, other, phlegm,

04:34.446 --> 04:36.013
miscellaneous ooze...

04:37.955 --> 04:40.761
Grampa's driving me crazy.

04:40.768 --> 04:43.023
Why are you telling me?He's your father-in-law.

04:43.026 --> 04:45.381
Can we at least get out of the house for an evening?

04:45.387 --> 04:48.691
Sure, but I think you're exaggerating the problem.

04:48.698 --> 04:49.853
I'm scared.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.603
Can I sleep across you?

04:54.846 --> 04:56.812
No!

04:59.868 --> 05:01.892
What are you doing here, Patty or Selma?

05:01.895 --> 05:04.132
I invited Selma here

05:04.137 --> 05:06.322
to watch Grandpa watch the kids.

05:06.328 --> 05:08.183
For some reason,she doesn't trust him.

05:08.188 --> 05:10.981
Maybe it's the bang-up job he did raising you.

05:10.985 --> 05:12.820
He was a great dad.

05:12.828 --> 05:14.770
Every year he got so mad

05:14.777 --> 05:16.913
when Santa didn't bring me presents.

05:19.716 --> 05:20.750
Um...

05:21.647 --> 05:23.123
lemon candy?

05:23.126 --> 05:24.012
No thanks.

05:24.028 --> 05:25.230
I brought my own.

05:43.905 --> 05:45.263
I know what you're wondering.

05:45.268 --> 05:47.760
How come a single woman with so much to offer

05:47.768 --> 05:49.703
is alone on a Saturday night.

05:49.707 --> 05:53.132
I assumed you were resting up for bingo tomorrow, like me.

05:53.938 --> 05:57.323
My numbers don't get called much these days.

05:57.338 --> 05:58.591
You're kidding.

05:58.596 --> 06:00.833
A sweet young thing like you?

06:00.835 --> 06:03.851
Wow, that's the first time anyone's ever

06:03.868 --> 06:06.561
put an adjective before calling me a thing.

06:17.135 --> 06:22.370
You know, I was voted best kisser in my P.O.W. camp.

06:22.445 --> 06:23.572
Hmm...

06:24.466 --> 06:26.690
Well, if he dies in my arms,

06:26.698 --> 06:28.833
I could meet a cute paramedic.

06:31.195 --> 06:33.731
All right, lips, man your kissing stations.

06:33.738 --> 06:35.132
This is not a drill.

06:40.757 --> 06:42.600
Well, here we are home early.

06:42.775 --> 06:45.963
Yeah, and the great prices at that new rib joint

06:45.965 --> 06:48.253
were the surprise of the evening.

06:50.495 --> 06:52.351
Ah! A bear is eating my father!

06:52.356 --> 06:53.610
I'm Selma.

06:53.848 --> 06:55.643
Ah! A talking bear is eating my father!

06:57.146 --> 06:59.741
You know what you were kissing?

06:59.927 --> 07:00.683
Do you?

07:00.907 --> 07:01.880
Do you?

07:01.965 --> 07:03.210
Yeah, I know who

07:03.216 --> 07:04.160
I was kissing,

07:04.168 --> 07:05.691
and I also know why.

07:05.696 --> 07:09.161
I'm a little shaky on when and where, but I got my theories.

07:09.167 --> 07:11.700
Well, I never, ever want to see that again.

07:11.804 --> 07:12.861
Ah, the hell with you.

07:12.863 --> 07:15.331
I just might ask that Selma girl out,

07:15.331 --> 07:17.479
and you can't tell me not to.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.543
My roof, my rules!

07:20.165 --> 07:22.921
Oh, why did I borrow that roof from him?

07:23.825 --> 07:27.731
So exactly what company am I giving these free boxes to?

07:27.736 --> 07:31.461
Uh... the name of the company is...

07:33.928 --> 07:34.501
Uh-huh.

07:34.698 --> 07:37.290
Are you run by dogs or for dogs?

07:37.296 --> 07:38.343
Actually, don't answer.

07:38.346 --> 07:39.771
I like not knowing.

07:40.565 --> 07:43.200
Now we just have to figure out what to do with these boxes.

07:43.206 --> 07:45.980
As always,I have some ideas.

07:46.576 --> 07:47.482
Hmm...

07:49.176 --> 07:50.330
"Build a fart."

07:50.845 --> 07:51.483
I love it.

07:51.485 --> 07:53.882
Fort.That's "build a fort."

07:53.886 --> 07:54.951
That might work, too.

07:58.486 --> 08:00.021
I'm glad you called.

08:00.025 --> 08:02.380
This is really going to drive Homer crazy.

08:02.386 --> 08:03.953
Well, actually,

08:03.955 --> 08:06.821
the real reason I asked you out is because I'm...

08:06.825 --> 08:08.773
well, I'm a little sweet on you.

08:08.778 --> 08:13.152
Oh, listen, Abe,the other night was fun, but...

08:13.157 --> 08:14.212
Ah, phooey on buts.

08:14.215 --> 08:16.333
At my age,and with your drawbacks,

08:16.348 --> 08:18.620
we can't afford to miss an opportunity.

08:18.627 --> 08:21.150
Why don't we just spend some time together

08:21.155 --> 08:22.980
and see where that takes us?

08:24.035 --> 08:25.952
Yeah, what the hell?

08:26.336 --> 08:28.430
Want to split a basket of garlic bread?

08:28.438 --> 08:30.023
Slow down, you hussy.

08:31.175 --> 08:35.190
<i>Is she really going out with him?</i>

08:35.597 --> 08:39.683
<i>Is she really gonna take him home tonight?</i>

08:39.684 --> 08:43.429
<i>Is she really going out with him?</i>

08:43.827 --> 08:47.961
<i>Is she really gonna take him home tonight?</i>

08:48.106 --> 08:51.063
<i>Is she really going out with him?</i>

08:51.075 --> 08:53.401
<i>'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me</i>

08:53.407 --> 08:56.671
<i>There's something going wrong around here.</i>

08:56.676 --> 09:00.880
Oh, look at Grampa and Selma frolicking in the water.

09:00.886 --> 09:02.031
It's not right.

09:02.036 --> 09:04.563
It's like an old sea turtle dating a suitcase

09:04.567 --> 09:05.771
that fell out of a plane.

09:05.775 --> 09:07.401
Be nice, Homer.

09:07.408 --> 09:10.690
Don't you see how great it is that they found each other?

09:10.695 --> 09:13.832
Like how the parts of a pig nobody wants combine

09:13.838 --> 09:15.661
to make a yummy hot dog.

09:15.665 --> 09:18.381
Oh, now you're dragging hot dogs into this.

09:18.386 --> 09:19.980
Real classy, Marge.

09:19.988 --> 09:21.323
Real classy.

09:21.335 --> 09:25.492
Hey, Homer, that garbage barge
is complaining about your smell.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.673
We wrote that joke in the water.
It wasn't all frolicking.

09:34.206 --> 09:36.391
How could my Dad go out with Selma ?

09:36.655 --> 09:40.072
Don't those two gargoyles know that love
is for good-looking young people ?

09:40.395 --> 09:41.570
Well, gee, Homer, you, uh,

09:41.746 --> 09:44.353
ain't exactly open-casket
material yourself.

09:45.035 --> 09:46.463
Words hurt, you know.

09:48.886 --> 09:49.892
They do.

09:51.615 --> 09:53.861
Stupid Selma and Grampa.

09:54.078 --> 09:55.951
How dare they find happiness.

09:56.178 --> 09:57.082
Psst! Over here.

09:57.287 --> 09:59.430
- It's me. Patty.
- Oh, great.

09:59.645 --> 10:01.442
Who are youin love with ?
Bart ?

10:01.708 --> 10:03.823
Look, if you want to break up
your father and Selma,

10:04.016 --> 10:06.320
I have a plan.
But it involves you.

10:06.557 --> 10:08.530
Okay, but I'm notgood at details.

10:08.765 --> 10:09.790
Or the big picture.

10:09.955 --> 10:11.903
I also show up late.
And drunk.

10:12.377 --> 10:14.760
I've got a goodfeeling about this.

10:16.707 --> 10:20.711
- Lower the drawbridge !
- What's the password ?

10:21.225 --> 10:22.833
I love my sister.

10:28.968 --> 10:30.641
Hey, you little brats.

10:30.916 --> 10:32.850
Get down from those battlements !

10:33.086 --> 10:34.673
Those boxes arefor shipping,

10:34.868 --> 10:37.440
not for creating a world
of pure imagination.

10:37.676 --> 10:38.670
Give them back.

10:38.837 --> 10:41.270
Not till we're bored with them.
Now, begone !

10:41.438 --> 10:42.622
I shall go,

10:42.898 --> 10:46.243
but I will return with
an army of my brethren

10:46.405 --> 10:48.980
and together we shall
take back what is ours

10:49.175 --> 10:52.210
and Hell will raindown up on you !

10:52.397 --> 10:53.570
What if we're not here ?

10:53.737 --> 10:56.712
We will come two more times,

10:56.866 --> 11:00.930
and then you'll have to come
to our customer center.

11:02.067 --> 11:04.631
It's near the airport,
where the old CrownBooks used to be.

11:11.487 --> 11:13.432
- Hello, Homer.
- Selma !

11:13.598 --> 11:15.342
Relax, it's just me, Patty.

11:15.985 --> 11:16.991
Patty !

11:17.466 --> 11:18.641
Do you have your disguise?

11:20.747 --> 11:23.572
Hola, I am Estebande la Sexface.

11:23.857 --> 11:25.322
That means
"Stephen of the Sexface."

11:25.487 --> 11:27.572
Okay, now let's prepare
our mental images

11:27.696 --> 11:30.171
so we can kiss each
other without barfing.

11:40.976 --> 11:42.572
Whoa-oa-oa !

11:51.585 --> 11:52.601
Mm! Yes!

11:53.617 --> 11:54.731
Oh, baby.

11:55.435 --> 11:56.431
What the...?

11:56.618 --> 11:58.300
Selma, how could you ?!

11:58.806 --> 12:00.452
Sorry, Abe, we're through.

12:00.605 --> 12:03.361
I thought we really had something.

12:04.645 --> 12:06.191
What the hell is going on here ?

12:07.128 --> 12:09.473
Dos Selmas?

12:13.587 --> 12:14.591

12:14.747 --> 12:16.672
Why would you try to break us up ?

12:17.016 --> 12:21.081
I guess I always dreamed that
my father would grow old alone.

12:21.375 --> 12:22.883
Well, nerts to both of ya !

12:23.246 --> 12:24.461

schemes could tear it apart !

12:28.246 --> 12:29.830
A thousand, eh?

12:30.156 --> 12:31.052
I love this woman

12:31.247 --> 12:33.913

she's in my life forever.

12:34.096 --> 12:35.700

12:50.526 --> 12:52.482
No!

12:59.745 --> 13:02.513
Dad, don't throw rice,
it makes the birds swell up !

13:02.756 --> 13:05.740
Oh, Lisa, that's one of those
rumors you get off the Internet.

13:09.858 --> 13:11.901
Hey, Selma, want some rice ?

13:16.346 --> 13:17.842
Pick a lane, freaks!

13:19.338 --> 13:23.671
Nothing solves everything
for ever like a wedding.

13:25.787 --> 13:26.901
