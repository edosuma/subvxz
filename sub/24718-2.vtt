33:11.264 --> 33:12.849
Unless you just broke up with a cowboy

33:12.885 --> 33:14.976
because that would just
bring up bad memories.

33:18.123 --> 33:20.891
I know what you were trying to do, and...

33:20.926 --> 33:23.393
well, it was actually kind of nice.

33:23.428 --> 33:25.262
See? I can do that sometimes.

33:25.297 --> 33:27.864
And it does feel good
to know that there are options

33:27.900 --> 33:30.400
out there... when I'm ready.

33:30.435 --> 33:33.703
You're gonna have no trouble
being with whoever you want.

33:33.739 --> 33:35.939
- Thanks.
- Excuse me, I was wondering

33:35.974 --> 33:38.408
if you're going to be here
at the restaurant

33:38.443 --> 33:41.411
- later tonight?
- Oh... um...

33:41.446 --> 33:44.614
It's really sweet of you to ask,

33:44.650 --> 33:46.550
but, um, I'm just not looking

33:46.585 --> 33:48.785
to be with anyone right now, so...

33:48.821 --> 33:51.760
Oh, no. I'm the repairman
for the ice machine.

33:51.796 --> 33:53.957
I just wanted to bring
the parts back later,

33:53.992 --> 33:56.348
- and get you running again.
- Oh...

33:56.383 --> 33:58.595
Right. Ice.

33:58.630 --> 34:01.492
- You know what? Tonight is great.
- Great. See you then.

34:01.527 --> 34:03.600
- I'm gonna see you then!
- Yup.

34:09.541 --> 34:11.507
Oh! I was just about to order

34:11.543 --> 34:13.610
- without you.
- Well, you might as well.

34:13.645 --> 34:15.779
I don't think I'll be eating a thing.

34:15.813 --> 34:17.781
Oh, here. I found this at Cassie's.

34:17.815 --> 34:19.850
It's so your heart doesn't explode.

34:19.885 --> 34:22.819
Thanks. Why is it pink?

34:22.855 --> 34:25.455
Apparently, it's healthier that way.

34:25.489 --> 34:27.424
This makes me think
about the time I dedicated

34:27.458 --> 34:30.793
- the Salt Creek Bridge.
- Yes, which is what has been

34:30.829 --> 34:32.629
on my mind all week.

34:32.664 --> 34:35.665
I'm supposed to rededicate it
this weekend.

34:35.701 --> 34:37.467
Really?

34:37.502 --> 34:39.335
Why didn't you mention that to me?

34:39.371 --> 34:41.638
Because I wanted to wait until
I could come up with something

34:41.672 --> 34:43.473
that was as memorable as what you said.

34:44.315 --> 34:45.507
When I was younger,

34:45.543 --> 34:48.478
I used to think that bridges
were built for going away,

34:48.945 --> 34:50.347
but now I know

34:50.382 --> 34:52.315
that what they're really
meant for is coming home.

34:52.351 --> 34:54.484
Now, you see? How on earth am I supposed

34:54.518 --> 34:56.485
to come up with something
as good as that?

34:56.521 --> 34:58.521
Because you already did.

34:59.372 --> 35:01.558
Martha, I got that line from you!

35:02.208 --> 35:03.627
I don't remember

35:03.662 --> 35:05.695
ever being that wise and sentimental.

35:05.731 --> 35:07.831
We were driving back
from a long weekend away.

35:08.465 --> 35:12.002
What you said gave me... my theme.

35:12.552 --> 35:14.671
I built my entire speech around that.

35:14.706 --> 35:17.574
So... I was your inspiration?

35:17.609 --> 35:21.511
Was, are and always will be.

35:21.546 --> 35:24.514
Well then, maybe I still have it in me!

Now I probably
won't be very good company,

35:26.585 --> 35:29.019
but now that I'm bursting
with brilliance,

35:29.054 --> 35:30.820
I've gotta write it all down.

35:30.856 --> 35:32.689
I am sure that whatever you say

35:32.724 --> 35:34.524
will be remembered for years to come.

35:34.559 --> 35:36.526
Oh, I just feel badly

35:36.561 --> 35:39.863
that no one will remember your
speech once they hear mine.

dinner." And then I realized,

Hmm. Yeah, I'm not sure that it is.

the other person to just know

have to tell them.
