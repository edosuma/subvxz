26:14.967 --> 26:16.133
MY HEART
GOES OUT TO YOU...

26:16.167 --> 26:20.600
BUT WE DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO,
RIGHT?

26:20.633 --> 26:24.933
I BARTEND AT THE BEAUTY BAR
ON CAHUENGA.

26:24.967 --> 26:27.533
OH, ISN'T THAT THE PLACE
WITH THE HAIR SALON CHAIRS?

26:27.567 --> 26:28.633
YEAH.

26:28.667 --> 26:31.233
YOU WANT CREAM, SUGAR,
IN YOUR COFFEE?

26:31.267 --> 26:32.833
OH, JUST
A LITTLE CREAM

26:32.867 --> 26:33.833
WOULD BE FINE.

26:33.867 --> 26:35.200
YEAH.

26:35.233 --> 26:36.967
YEAH, THE MONEY'S GREAT,

26:37.067 --> 26:38.967
SO I WORK THERE
A FEW NIGHTS A WEEK,

26:39.067 --> 26:40.200
AND...

26:41.467 --> 26:43.100
WHILE JARED'S IN SCHOOL,

26:43.133 --> 26:45.233
I DO TELEMARKETING FROM HOME.

26:45.267 --> 26:47.767
SO THE REST OF THE FREE TIME
WE SPEND TOGETHER.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.067
WELL...

26:49.067 --> 26:50.533
WE DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO,
RIGHT?

26:50.567 --> 26:52.267
WELL, SOME OF US DO,

26:52.300 --> 26:57.600
AND SOME OF US DON'T TAKE
ANY RESPONSIBILITY AT ALL.

26:57.633 --> 26:59.700
LIKE JARED'S FATHER.

27:01.067 --> 27:02.167
OH.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.900
UM...

27:03.933 --> 27:05.400
I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

27:05.433 --> 27:07.400
AH, I'M OVER IT.

27:07.433 --> 27:10.400
I'D BE HAPPY TO NEVER
FUCK ANOTHER MAN IN MY LIFE.

27:12.900 --> 27:14.700
THE CREAM WENT OFF.

27:16.200 --> 27:18.067
IT'S OKAY.

27:20.067 --> 27:21.533
I'M JUST SORRY FOR JARED...

27:21.567 --> 27:22.900
THAT'S ALL.

27:22.933 --> 27:24.800
HE WISHES HE HAD A DAD.

27:24.833 --> 27:28.833
WELL, HE'S GOT
A PRETTY INCREDIBLE MOM.

27:28.867 --> 27:30.900
[JARED AND SHAY CHATTERING
IN BACKGROUND]

27:32.567 --> 27:34.100
UM...

27:34.133 --> 27:35.767
BUT I'M GUESSING
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN, WHAT,

27:35.800 --> 27:37.067
16 WHEN YOU HAD HIM?

27:37.067 --> 27:40.200
18...

27:40.233 --> 27:43.567
BUT SOMETIMES I FEEL
LIKE I'M A MILLION YEARS OLD,

27:43.600 --> 27:46.333
AND BEFORE
YOU KNOW IT,

27:46.367 --> 27:49.700
I WILL BE TOO OLD AND WRETCHED
TO PICK UP THE PIECES.

27:49.733 --> 27:50.867
NO...

27:50.900 --> 27:52.700
PLEASE.
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

27:52.733 --> 27:55.633
I DON'T THINK
YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

27:57.833 --> 27:59.367
ARE YOU HITTING ON ME?

28:02.300 --> 28:02.800
UH...

28:02.833 --> 28:04.767
I WASN'T. UM...

28:04.800 --> 28:06.200
BUT I'M...

28:06.233 --> 28:08.900
I'M SORRY TO MAKE YOU
UNCOMFORTABLE, IF...

28:08.933 --> 28:10.767
IF YOU THINK I WAS.

28:13.100 --> 28:14.533
NO, NO.

28:14.567 --> 28:16.100
I'M SORRY.

28:16.133 --> 28:18.733
I WAS HOPING
YOU WERE.

28:22.233 --> 28:23.767
MOM, CAN I GO
TO THE BEVERLY CENTER NOW?

28:23.800 --> 28:25.700
I WANT TO SHOW SHAY
THE BIONICLES

28:25.733 --> 28:27.200
BEFORE THE MOVIE.

28:27.233 --> 28:28.233
YEAH, I SHOULD...

28:28.267 --> 28:29.567
I SHOULD
GET TO WORK, TOO.

28:29.600 --> 28:30.767
UH, YEAH.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.200
WHY DON'T YOU TWO
GO BACK TO THE POD

28:32.233 --> 28:33.200
AND PUT YOUR SHOES ON,

28:33.233 --> 28:34.233
AND THEN WE'LL GO.

28:38.067 --> 28:39.333
BRILLIANT TIMING.

28:39.367 --> 28:41.267
YEAH.

28:41.300 --> 28:43.500
YEAH, UM...

28:43.533 --> 28:45.733
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR THE COFFEE.

28:45.767 --> 28:49.167
I HOPE WE CAN
DO IT AGAIN.

28:49.200 --> 28:50.600
ME TOO.

28:50.633 --> 28:52.067
UH, THANK YOU

28:52.067 --> 28:53.400
FOR WATCHING SHAY
AS WELL.

28:53.433 --> 28:55.300
IT'S MY PLEASURE.

28:55.333 --> 28:57.767
TALK TO YOU LATER.

29:04.833 --> 29:06.433
OH, THAT LOOKS WONDERFUL.

29:06.467 --> 29:07.967
THANK YOU.

29:08.067 --> 29:09.633
SO I CALLED

29:09.667 --> 29:10.867
THE WOOD DELIVERY
PEOPLE.

29:10.900 --> 29:12.100
THEY'LL BE HERE
IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR.

29:12.133 --> 29:13.367
OH, THANK YOU, HONEY.

29:13.400 --> 29:15.800
OOH.

29:15.833 --> 29:17.067
GO SIT BY THE FIRE.

29:17.067 --> 29:18.433
YOU'RE GETTING UNDERFOOT.

29:18.467 --> 29:19.867
[KISS]

29:24.067 --> 29:26.667
THE PERILS OF BEING
THE EXECUTIVE VICE CHANCELLOR.

29:26.700 --> 29:29.667
SHE CERTAINLY MANAGES
TO SQUEEZE A LOT IN.

29:29.700 --> 29:32.100
YEAH, WELL, UP AT STANFORD,

29:32.133 --> 29:34.767
SHE CHAIRED
AT LEAST 15 COMMITTEES,

29:34.800 --> 29:36.500
AND SHE PRETTY MUCH
SINGLE-HANDEDLY

29:36.533 --> 29:37.900
RESURRECTED

29:37.933 --> 29:41.133
THE SCHOOL
OF ENGINEERING.

29:41.167 --> 29:44.233
THAT'S MY DEPARTMENT.

29:44.267 --> 29:45.467
YOU KNOW--

29:45.500 --> 29:47.600
OH, NO, LEONARD.
YOU CAN'T HAVE THEM.

29:47.633 --> 29:48.933
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN COOKED YET.

29:48.967 --> 29:53.533
WELL, UH, LET ME KNOW
IF I CAN HELP OR ANYTHING,

29:53.567 --> 29:55.100
ALL RIGHT?

29:58.400 --> 30:00.733
I WISH YOU WERE COMING TONIGHT.

30:00.767 --> 30:02.967
LEONARD IS JUST
IRRITATING THE HELL OUT OF ME.

30:03.000 --> 30:07.600
I DON'T KNOW WHY I ASKED HIM
TO COME DOWN FOR THIS.

30:07.633 --> 30:12.000
I HAD SUCH A WONDERFUL TIME
LAST NIGHT AND THIS MORNING.

30:12.033 --> 30:13.867
I MISS YOU.

30:13.900 --> 30:17.700
I LOVE YOU.

30:17.733 --> 30:18.700
CALL ME LATER.

30:18.733 --> 30:21.067
NO, DON'T CALL ME.
I'LL CALL YOU.

30:21.100 --> 30:23.867
WHEW.

30:23.900 --> 30:25.033
[KNOCKING]

30:25.067 --> 30:27.033
[SHANE, OPENING DOOR]:
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. WHAT?

30:27.067 --> 30:28.133
[ALICE]:
HELLO, HELLO.

30:28.167 --> 30:29.933
I LIKE YOUR OUTFIT.
I LIKE YOURS.

30:29.967 --> 30:30.800
I LIKE YOURS,
GREASED LIGHTNING.

30:30.833 --> 30:32.033
GREASED LIGHTNING.

30:32.067 --> 30:32.800
AND THE HAT'S CUTE TOO.

30:32.833 --> 30:33.733
THANKS. I JUST GOT IT.

30:33.767 --> 30:34.867
HEY, UH, JEN.

30:34.900 --> 30:35.700
WE'RE GOING TO HERE.
DO YOU WANT TO COME?

30:35.733 --> 30:37.233
MM-HMM.

30:37.267 --> 30:39.267
CAN I JUST FINISH MY DINNER
AND THEN GO GET CHANGED?

30:39.300 --> 30:40.367
YES.

30:40.400 --> 30:41.167
IF SHE'S GOING,
I'M NOT GOING.

30:41.200 --> 30:42.233
HUH?
WHAT?

30:42.267 --> 30:44.167
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

30:44.200 --> 30:45.400
JENNY, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

30:45.433 --> 30:47.100
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
ALICE?

30:47.133 --> 30:50.167
OH, NO, JUST CALL ME ALYSSE,
THE BISEXUAL FASHION VICTIM.

30:50.200 --> 30:51.167
I'M SORRY, IS MY HAT TOO MUCH?

30:51.200 --> 30:53.500
A LITTLE. WHAT?

30:53.533 --> 30:54.167
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

30:54.200 --> 30:55.467
JENNY WROTE A STORY.

30:55.500 --> 30:56.867
IT WAS PUBLISHED
IN THE NEW YORKER.

30:56.900 --> 30:58.567
WE'RE ALL VERY, VERY EXCITED
FOR YOU, JENNY.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.467
BUT WE'RE IN IT.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.633
WE'RE IN IT.

31:02.667 --> 31:04.067
OH...

31:04.067 --> 31:05.267
THANK YOU, ALICE,
FOR BEING SO GRACIOUS

31:05.300 --> 31:07.300
ABOUT MY ACCOMPLISHMENT

31:07.333 --> 31:08.867
OF BEING PUBLISHED
IN THE NEW YORKER,

31:08.900 --> 31:10.167
BUT, ALICE,

31:10.200 --> 31:11.500
IF YOU ACTUALLY READ
BEYOND THE COVER--

31:11.533 --> 31:12.600
OH, I READ IT.

31:12.633 --> 31:13.833
YOU DID?
YEAH.

31:13.867 --> 31:15.400
IT'S IN THE NEW YORKER,
FICTION ISSUE.

31:15.433 --> 31:16.567
THEREFORE, YOU'D SEE

31:16.600 --> 31:18.067
THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY
A WORK OF FICTION.

31:18.067 --> 31:19.800
OH, THAT'S BULLSHIT.

31:19.833 --> 31:21.367
I TAKE IT YOU HAVEN'T READ
THIS "STORY."

31:21.400 --> 31:23.067
CLEARLY NOT. NO.

31:23.100 --> 31:24.600
YOU READ IT. TELL HER.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.800
YEAH, I READ IT.

31:26.833 --> 31:29.200
I MEAN,
SHE CLAIMS THAT IT'S NOT YOU.

31:29.233 --> 31:30.633
IT'S NOT.

31:30.667 --> 31:32.333
I DRAW FROM
MY OWN LIFE,

31:32.367 --> 31:34.933
AND I USE MY FRIENDS
AND MY OWN EXPERIENCES

31:34.967 --> 31:36.433
AS INSPIRATION,

31:36.467 --> 31:37.933
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
IT'S FICTION.

31:37.967 --> 31:39.500
RIGHT. RIGHT.

31:39.533 --> 31:42.433
YEAH, THERE'S THIS CHARACTER
NAMED SHAUN, SHANE,

31:42.467 --> 31:43.767
AND SHE'S A MAKEUP ARTIST,
RIGHT?

31:43.800 --> 31:45.767
AM I CORRECT?
MM-HMM.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.767
YEAH, AND SHE SLEEPS
WITH A LOT OF GIRLS...

31:47.800 --> 31:48.533
THAT'S NOT BAD.

31:48.567 --> 31:49.833
HEY, ALICE.

31:49.867 --> 31:52.100
YOU KNOW, THERE'S THIS
CRAZY WEIRD THING THAT HAPPENS

31:52.133 --> 31:53.067
WHEN YOU WRITE.

31:53.067 --> 31:54.667
AS A WRITER--

31:54.700 --> 31:55.733
WAIT, IS THIS A LESSON?

31:55.767 --> 31:56.533
YEAH.
IN WRITING?

31:56.567 --> 31:58.067
FROM
JENNY SCHECTER?

31:58.067 --> 31:58.867
YEAH.

31:58.900 --> 32:00.067
OH, FUCK, LET ME GRAB A PEN.

32:00.067 --> 32:01.800
GET A PAD, TOO.

32:01.833 --> 32:03.200
SO THIS THING THAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU WRITE

32:03.233 --> 32:04.067
IS YOU DRAW FROM YOUR OWN LIFE,

32:04.067 --> 32:05.300
AND THEN, IN TURN,

32:05.333 --> 32:07.200
YOU TAKE THOSE EXPERIENCES

32:07.233 --> 32:10.300
AND YOU USE SOMETHING
CALLED IMAGINATION, ALICE.

32:10.333 --> 32:12.567
OH, IMAGINATION.

32:12.600 --> 32:13.867
GOD.

32:13.900 --> 32:15.067
SO THAT'S THE THING
YOU WERE LACKING

32:15.100 --> 32:17.100
WHEN YOU COULD BARELY
CHANGE OUR NAMES, HUH?

32:17.133 --> 32:17.967
HEY, JUST A SECOND.
YOU GUYS...

32:18.067 --> 32:20.933
DO YOU... DO YOU HEAR THAT?

32:20.967 --> 32:24.067
OH, MY GOD,
IT'S MONET.

32:24.100 --> 32:25.867
MONET
HAS COME BACK FROM THE DEAD,

32:25.900 --> 32:27.633
AND HE WANTS ME
TO GIVE YOU A MESSAGE.

32:27.667 --> 32:29.233
HE SAYS,
"I AM SO SORRY

32:29.267 --> 32:31.633
"FOR SITTING IN FRONT
OF MY POND IN FRANCE

32:31.667 --> 32:33.467
"AND SKETCHING
THOSE WATER LILIES

32:33.500 --> 32:35.133
"AND USING
THE WATER LILIES

32:35.167 --> 32:37.667
"AS ACTUAL INSPIRATION.

32:37.700 --> 32:39.100
SORRY TO OFFEND, ALICE."

32:39.133 --> 32:40.567
RIGHT, RIGHT.

32:40.600 --> 32:41.300
OH, WAIT.

32:41.333 --> 32:42.200
HE'S TALKING TO ME.

32:42.233 --> 32:44.133
SO WEIRD. IT'S CRA-- HUH?

32:44.167 --> 32:46.133
WHAT?

32:46.167 --> 32:48.667
OKAY, I'LL TELL HER.

32:48.700 --> 32:52.267
HE SAID DON'T EVER FUCKING
COMPARE YOURSELF TO HIM.

32:52.300 --> 32:54.300
[TOM INTERPRETING]:
I WAS SAYING,

32:54.333 --> 32:55.333
I'M NOT SURE

32:55.367 --> 32:57.067
WHERE I'M PUTTING THE SCULPTURE
YET.

32:57.067 --> 33:00.700
I DID MOVE A HAMMOCK IN, THOUGH.

33:00.733 --> 33:02.067
AT SOME POINT,

33:02.100 --> 33:05.667
I LIKE TO SLEEP AND WORK
IN THE SAME PLACE.

33:05.700 --> 33:08.133
SO I LIKE TO BE INTIMATE
WITH MY OBJECTS.

33:08.167 --> 33:09.933
AND THE OBJECTS BEING

33:09.967 --> 33:11.200
ALL OF THIS JUNK
YOU HAULED IN.

33:12.667 --> 33:13.733
THAT COULD SOUND
RUDE, WEB.

33:13.767 --> 33:16.200
HIS TONE--

33:16.233 --> 33:18.333
NO, NO, NO. I GOT HIS TONE.

33:18.367 --> 33:19.333
IT'S OKAY.

33:19.367 --> 33:20.833
SHE'S GOT MY TONE.

33:20.867 --> 33:22.200
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

33:25.300 --> 33:26.300
OH...

33:28.167 --> 33:29.867
HERE'S SOMEONE
I REALLY HAVE TO MEET.

33:29.900 --> 33:33.100
NICE TO, UH, MEET YOU.

33:33.133 --> 33:35.067
[SPEAKING SLOWLY AND LOUDLY]:
UH, WELL,

33:35.067 --> 33:37.833
IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU, DON.

33:37.867 --> 33:40.167
IT'S TOM.

33:40.200 --> 33:40.867
AND I'M NOT DEAF.

33:40.900 --> 33:42.733
AH. RIGHT.

33:42.767 --> 33:43.467
AND, UM...

33:43.500 --> 33:44.567
JODI.

33:44.600 --> 33:45.500
JODI.

33:45.533 --> 33:46.233
AND I'M DEAF.

33:46.267 --> 33:47.833
YES, OF COURSE.

33:47.867 --> 33:50.300
I MEAN, WELL YOU KNOW,
I'M GOING TO GO SEE MY FRIEND.

33:50.333 --> 33:50.933
BYE-BYE.

33:50.967 --> 33:51.533
TAKE CARE.

33:51.567 --> 33:55.400

34:04.133 --> 34:06.533
HELLO.

34:06.567 --> 34:11.300
MY, MY, YOU CLEAN UP NICE.

34:11.333 --> 34:13.867
THANKS.

34:13.900 --> 34:16.633
[TOM INTERPRETING]:
I CAN'T SAY THE SAME FOR YOU.

34:16.667 --> 34:19.933
TOM. SO NICE TO SEE YOU.

34:19.967 --> 34:22.467
THANK YOU.

34:22.500 --> 34:23.800
DID YOU JUST INSULT ME?

34:23.833 --> 34:27.067
NO.

34:27.067 --> 34:28.533
YOU'RE JUST ALWAYS
SO VERY CLEAN.

34:28.567 --> 34:31.633
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
YOU BEING DIRTY AT ALL.

34:31.667 --> 34:32.767
I'VE BEEN PLENTY DIRTY.

34:32.800 --> 34:36.600
OH. HMM.

34:36.633 --> 34:38.700
I HAVE A HARD TIME
PICTURING THAT.

34:38.733 --> 34:39.767
I'M SORRY, I JUST...

34:39.800 --> 34:42.433
I DON'T KNOW,

34:42.467 --> 34:45.600
MAYBE A FETCHING LITTLE SMUDGE
RIGHT ABOUT--

34:45.633 --> 34:47.100
DIRTIER.

35:04.900 --> 35:06.167
I DON'T ENVY YOU,

35:06.200 --> 35:09.467
TRYING TO RAISE MONEY
FROM CREEPS LIKE THOSE GUYS.

35:09.500 --> 35:10.667
IT'S NOT SO BAD.

35:14.800 --> 35:16.333
ACTUALLY,
IT'S A FUCKING NIGHTMARE.

35:17.733 --> 35:20.533
OH, GOD.

35:20.567 --> 35:20.633
UGH.

35:22.067 --> 35:23.500

35:24.700 --> 35:25.433
THEY'RE DICKS.

35:25.467 --> 35:28.700
YEAH, I DID.
I GOT THAT.

35:30.200 --> 35:31.933
LET'S GET STONED.

35:31.967 --> 35:33.567
THEN WE CAN LAUGH AT THEM.

35:33.600 --> 35:35.200
I CAN'T DO THAT.
OH, COME ON.

35:35.233 --> 35:36.300
I CAN'T,

35:36.333 --> 35:37.300
BUT THANK YOU
FOR THE INVITATION.

35:37.333 --> 35:40.200
BREAK SOME RULES, BETTE.

35:40.233 --> 35:41.700
IT WILL LIBERATE YOU.

35:41.733 --> 35:43.167
I CAN'T.

35:43.200 --> 35:45.533
COME ON.

35:45.567 --> 35:46.867
COME ON, DEAN.

35:46.900 --> 35:48.600

35:50.867 --> 35:54.067
ALL I'M SAYING
IS THAT YOU'VE DONE IT YOURSELF

35:54.067 --> 35:56.067
IN YOUR, LIKE,
FUCKING RADIO SHOW AND--

35:56.067 --> 35:57.500
THAT IS SO
DIFFERENT.

35:57.533 --> 35:58.733
WHY ARE YOU YELLING?

35:58.767 --> 35:59.433
DON'T YELL.

35:59.467 --> 36:01.167
ON TOP OF THAT,

36:01.200 --> 36:02.233
I JUST WANT TO MAKE
ANOTHER POINT.

36:02.267 --> 36:03.067
I JUST WANT
TO MAKE THE POINT

36:03.100 --> 36:04.600
THAT YOU
ARE SOMEHOW SAYING

36:04.633 --> 36:06.667
THAT I DON'T HAVE
ONE CREATIVE BONE IN MY BODY,

36:06.700 --> 36:07.567
AND THAT'S BULLSHIT.

36:07.600 --> 36:08.600
YEAH, WHATEVER.
WHATEVER.

36:08.633 --> 36:09.367

THAT BROUGHT IT UP.

36:12.233 --> 36:13.167
DO YOU KNOW
WHO MAKES THIS HAT?

36:13.200 --> 36:14.067
WHO?

36:14.100 --> 36:15.367
DO YOU KNOW?
NO.

36:15.400 --> 36:16.400
YOU DON'T KNOW.
I WOULD GUESS--

36:16.433 --> 36:18.067
I WOULD GUESS

36:18.067 --> 36:20.767

44:13.500 --> 44:14.400
THAT WOULD BE COOL.

44:15.400 --> 44:16.800
[CELLPHONE RINGS]

44:16.833 --> 44:17.967
OH, SHOOT. SORRY.

44:21.100 --> 44:22.333
HELLO?

44:22.367 --> 44:23.733
HEY, HELENA.

44:23.767 --> 44:25.700
YEAH. NO, I'M OUT.

44:25.733 --> 44:27.133
YEAH.

44:27.167 --> 44:28.500
YOU RAN INTO--

44:28.533 --> 44:30.067
I DON'T KNOW WHO
DOUGLAS CHIBI IS, NO.

44:32.567 --> 44:33.967
I-- WILL YOU SLOW DOWN?

44:34.067 --> 44:36.967
BECAUSE I CAN'T--
I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING YOU.

44:37.067 --> 44:38.733
WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO

44:38.767 --> 44:41.067
IS PLEASE GO TO PETROSSIAN,

44:41.067 --> 44:44.667
GET ME FIVE POUNDS
OF SEVRUGA CAVIAR.

44:44.700 --> 44:45.700
I'VE STILL GOT SOME BLINIS,

44:45.733 --> 44:47.967
I CAN CUT UP SOME EGGS AND--

44:48.067 --> 44:51.900
ALICE, I DON'T CARE
HOW MUCH IT IS, OKAY?

44:51.933 --> 44:54.700
IT'S THE ONLY WAY FOR ME
TO SALVAGE THIS FUCKING PARTY.

44:54.733 --> 44:59.633
THIS PARTY IS SO MUCH BETTER
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

45:06.600 --> 45:09.867
YOU ARE MUCH NAUGHTIER
THAN I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE.

45:18.833 --> 45:19.767
MORE.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.100
SHE ASKED ME

45:21.133 --> 45:23.900
IF I THINK YOU'VE EVER
BEEN REALLY DECADENT.

45:26.433 --> 45:28.700
ACTUALLY, I PREFER NOT
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

45:28.733 --> 45:31.233
I'D RATHER PRESERVE
MY VISION OF DEAN PORTER

45:31.267 --> 45:34.333
AS THE IMPENETRABLE
ICE QUEEN.

45:42.133 --> 45:44.267
THAT IS SO FUCKED UP.

45:44.300 --> 45:45.300
HERE.

45:45.333 --> 45:47.567
IT IS. IT IS!

45:47.600 --> 45:48.100
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

45:48.133 --> 45:49.333
I HAVE TO SAY,

45:49.367 --> 45:52.867
IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY USEFUL

45:52.900 --> 45:54.767
TO HAVE PEOPLE THINK
THAT YOU'RE IMPENETRABLE

45:54.800 --> 45:57.433
BECAUSE THEN
IT MAKES THEM WANT YOU,

45:57.467 --> 46:02.333
AND YOU GET ALL OF THESE
REALLY GREAT INVITATIONS.

46:02.367 --> 46:05.733
OH...

46:05.767 --> 46:07.900
TELL.

46:07.933 --> 46:09.767
TELL EVERYTHING.

46:12.500 --> 46:15.700
COME ON, DEAN.

46:15.733 --> 46:17.200
CAVIAR BLINIS?

46:17.233 --> 46:19.067
MARVELOUS TOUCH,
HELENA.

46:19.067 --> 46:20.233
I HAD NO IDEA
WE HAD IT IN THE BUDGET.

46:20.267 --> 46:21.167
SCREW THE BUDGET.

46:21.200 --> 46:22.367
I WANT YOU YOU
TO COME UP TO STANFORD

46:22.400 --> 46:23.767
AND CATER SOME PARTIES

46:23.800 --> 46:25.167
FOR THE DEPARTMENT
OF ENGINEERING.

46:25.200 --> 46:26.700
NO WAY.

46:26.733 --> 46:27.500
I'M NOT SHARING HER.

46:27.533 --> 46:30.200
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HAPPY, PHYLLIS.

46:30.233 --> 46:32.300
WELL, SHE'S USUALLY
VERY GENEROUS.

46:32.333 --> 46:34.933
SHE MUST ADORE YOU.

46:34.967 --> 46:37.067
HELENA, I'M--

46:37.067 --> 46:39.500
ALICE!

46:39.533 --> 46:41.600
I'M SORRY.

46:41.633 --> 46:43.367
I WAS JUST
DROPPING SOME STUFF OFF

46:43.400 --> 46:44.100
FOR HELENA,

46:44.133 --> 46:45.200
BUT I'M GOING TO GO.

46:45.233 --> 46:45.900
HI.

46:45.933 --> 46:46.300
I'M LEONARD...

46:46.333 --> 46:48.167
KROLL.

46:48.200 --> 46:49.500
I'M PHYLLIS' HUSBAND.

46:49.533 --> 46:50.167
GREAT. YEAH. ALICE.

46:50.200 --> 46:51.100
ALICE.

46:51.133 --> 46:52.600
I LOVE YOUR HAT.

46:52.633 --> 46:53.567
YOU DO?

46:53.600 --> 46:54.867
MM-HMM.
IT'S GREAT.

46:54.900 --> 46:57.167
I'M, UH, HELENA'S ROOMMATE.

46:57.200 --> 46:59.067
OH, WELL,
YOU'RE LUCKY.

46:59.067 --> 47:01.167
GREAT COOK.

47:01.200 --> 47:05.067
I DIDN'T EXACTLY COOK
THE CAVIAR.

47:05.100 --> 47:06.500
STILL GOOD.

47:06.533 --> 47:09.267
YOU MUST...EAT WELL.

47:09.300 --> 47:10.367
SO, CAN I GET YOU
A DRINK

47:10.400 --> 47:11.533
OR SOMETHING TO EAT?

47:11.567 --> 47:12.433
THE FOOD'S GREAT.

47:12.467 --> 47:13.233
NO, I'M GOOD.

47:13.267 --> 47:15.733
GOOD.

47:15.767 --> 47:17.233
WELL, WELCOME.

47:17.267 --> 47:18.200
THANK YOU.

47:18.233 --> 47:19.400
IT'S A REALLY,
REALLY BEAUTIFUL HOUSE.

47:19.433 --> 47:21.733
OH, THANK YOU.
WELL, WE LIKE IT.

47:21.767 --> 47:24.200
IT'S SNUG.

47:24.233 --> 47:25.733
ARE THOSE YOUR KIDS?

47:25.767 --> 47:28.267
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

47:28.300 --> 47:30.833
MOLLY IS A JUNIOR
AT VASSAR NOW,

47:30.867 --> 47:33.400
AND SOPHIA IS JUST
STARTING BENNINGTON.

47:33.433 --> 47:35.833
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY.

47:35.867 --> 47:38.233
YEAH, WE'RE VERY
PROUD OF THEM.

47:38.267 --> 47:40.667
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

47:40.700 --> 47:44.733
HOW OLD WERE YOU TWO HERE?

47:44.767 --> 47:45.767
WHAT WAS I?

47:45.800 --> 47:47.700
I WAS 36,
AND YOU WERE, UH...

47:47.733 --> 47:48.367
29.

47:48.400 --> 47:51.733
[LAUGHS]: 29...

47:54.967 --> 47:57.533
OKAY, WELL... BEAUTIFUL.

47:57.567 --> 47:58.400
BEAUTIFUL.

47:58.433 --> 47:59.067
THANK YOU.

47:59.067 --> 48:01.233
OKAY.

48:01.267 --> 48:03.167
ALL RIGHT,
IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU.

48:03.200 --> 48:04.133
NICE TO
MEET YOU TOO.

48:04.167 --> 48:05.300
OKAY. SEE YOU LATER.

48:05.333 --> 48:06.200
COME BY ANY TIME.

48:06.233 --> 48:07.067
OKAY.

48:07.100 --> 48:09.633
CUTE.

48:09.667 --> 48:12.467
WELL, THERE WAS THIS ONE TIME

48:12.500 --> 48:14.067
THAT TINA AND I

48:14.100 --> 48:16.867
WERE ON THIS REALLY
REALLY BIG YACHT,

48:16.900 --> 48:19.467
AND TINA AND I
WERE IN OUR STATEROOM,

48:19.500 --> 48:22.067
AND VALENTINO IS UP ON THE DECK,

48:22.067 --> 48:25.133
AND HE WAS, LIKE,
LITTLE BLACK SPEEDOS,

48:25.167 --> 48:28.100
AND THE SENATOR COMES IN

48:28.133 --> 48:31.333
TO THE ROOM...

48:31.367 --> 48:34.267
WITH THIS BONER.

48:37.967 --> 48:39.233
I'VE HEARD
HE'S GOT A COCK

48:39.267 --> 48:41.967
THE SIZE OF
A TINY LITTLE CIGAR.

48:42.067 --> 48:44.467
[BETTE]: IT'S MORE LIKE
A CIGARILLO, ACTUALLY,

48:44.500 --> 48:47.267
THAT'S BEEN IN SOMEONE'S POCKET
FOR FOUR DAYS.

48:47.300 --> 48:49.233
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

48:49.267 --> 48:51.233
SPARE ME THE DETAILS.

48:51.267 --> 48:53.467
DID HE WHIP IT OUT?

48:55.533 --> 48:57.067
OF COURSE HE DID,

48:57.100 --> 48:58.533
AND THEN I YELLED,

48:58.567 --> 48:59.733
AND TINA DOVE
UNDER THE COVERS,

48:59.767 --> 49:00.800
AND IT WAS JUST...

49:00.833 --> 49:03.200
IT WASN'T PRETTY.

49:03.233 --> 49:04.533
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY ALL THINK

49:04.567 --> 49:06.267
THEY CAN INVITE THEMSELVES
INTO OUR BED.

49:06.300 --> 49:08.067
I DON'T KNOW.

49:11.700 --> 49:12.667
SHE WANTS TO KNOW

49:12.700 --> 49:14.600
IF YOU KNOW HOW
TO SHOTGUN.

49:14.633 --> 49:17.700
WELL, YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO HAVE TO FIND OUT.

49:18.900 --> 49:23.633
[**]

49:23.667 --> 49:27.400
* ALL I WANT
IS FOR YOU TO STAY *

49:27.433 --> 49:32.400

* ALL I CRAVE
IS YOUR NUMBER... *

49:43.400 --> 49:45.567
SHIT.

49:47.400 --> 49:48.400
ALICE, WAIT.

49:50.500 --> 49:51.500
I WANT TO EXPLAIN.

49:51.533 --> 49:52.633
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

49:52.667 --> 49:54.567
HE'S YOUR HUSBAND.

49:54.600 --> 49:56.500
WE'RE NOT LIKE THAT.

49:56.533 --> 49:57.533
WE HAVEN'T HAD A PHYSICAL
RELATIONSHIP FOR YEARS.

49:57.567 --> 49:59.800
I MEAN, WE HAVEN'T...

49:59.833 --> 50:00.800
WE...

50:00.833 --> 50:02.200
WE DON'T F--

50:02.233 --> 50:03.200
ALICE...

50:03.233 --> 50:05.300
NO.

50:05.333 --> 50:07.633
WE DON'T FUCK, OKAY?

50:07.667 --> 50:09.033
IT'S NOT REALLY THAT.

50:09.067 --> 50:10.400
I THINK I'VE BEEN
A LITTLE SELFISH.

50:10.433 --> 50:12.167
[ALICE CONTINUES]:
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT FOR A SECOND

50:12.200 --> 50:13.867
THAT YOU HAVE A HUSBAND,
YOU HAVE A FAMILY,

50:13.900 --> 50:14.667
YOU HAVE KIDS...

50:14.700 --> 50:16.133
THAT'S NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

50:16.167 --> 50:16.967
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.233
I'M GOING TO HURT ANYBODY.

50:18.267 --> 50:19.433
I'M NOT SAYING THAT.

50:19.467 --> 50:20.767
I'M JUST SAYING,

50:20.800 --> 50:22.233
I DON'T THINK I FEEL COMFORTABLE
DOING THIS ANYMORE.

50:22.267 --> 50:24.500
ALICE, I'VE NEVER FELT
THIS WAY BEFORE

50:24.533 --> 50:25.600
ABOUT ANYONE.

50:25.633 --> 50:26.600
OKAY, LISTEN.

50:26.633 --> 50:27.567
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS
WITH HIM INSIDE.

50:27.600 --> 50:28.233
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

50:28.267 --> 50:29.633
I THINK I SHOULD GO.

50:29.667 --> 50:30.700
I REALLY DO.

50:30.733 --> 50:31.367
CAN YOU LET GO OF MY HANDS?
PLEASE?

50:31.400 --> 50:32.233
PLEASE?

50:32.267 --> 50:34.033
ALICE...

50:34.067 --> 50:36.667
CAN YOU LET GO OF MY HANDS?
PLEASE?

50:36.700 --> 50:37.867
I LOVE YOU.

50:37.900 --> 50:39.367
PLEASE?

50:39.400 --> 50:41.200
ALICE, PLEASE.
THANK YOU.

* I'LL GIVE TO YOU

51:19.567 --> 51:23.133
* TENDER LOVE

51:26.700 --> 51:32.333
* TAKE OFF YOUR COAT

51:32.367 --> 51:37.633
