00:32.500 --> 00:34.730
<i> ~ We meet at evening time ~</i>

00:34.940 --> 00:37.170
<i>~ This week at evening time ~</i>

00:37.380 --> 00:43.410
<i>~ To know I'll spend</i>
<i>an hour or two just with you ~</i>

00:43.620 --> 00:46.134
<i>~ Then when the hour grows late ~</i>

00:46.340 --> 00:48.979
<i>~ I love to hesitate ~</i>

00:49.180 --> 00:52.650
<i>~ The moment seems so fleeting ~</i>

00:52.860 --> 00:56.899
<i>~ While I am here repeating ~</i>

00:57.100 --> 01:00.376
<i>~ I stand and say good night ~</i>

01:00.580 --> 01:03.811
<i>~ It's grand to say good night ~</i>

01:04.019 --> 01:10.368
<i>~ Then stay and say it</i>
<i>over and over by your door ~</i>

01:10.580 --> 01:13.572
<i>~ The milk man hurries by ~</i>

01:13.780 --> 01:16.772
<i>~ But sweetheart, here am I ~</i>

01:16.980 --> 01:20.450
<i>~ Again I fondly hold you ~</i>

01:20.660 --> 01:26.018
<i>~ Repeating all I've told you ~</i>

01:28.260 --> 01:32.572
<i>~ Stars shining bright above you ~</i>

01:32.780 --> 01:37.058
<i>~ Night breeze</i>
<i>that seems to whisper I love you ~</i>

01:37.260 --> 01:41.048
<i>~ Birds singing in the sycamore tree ~</i>

01:41.260 --> 01:45.094
<i>~ Dream a little dream of me ~</i>

01:45.300 --> 01:49.373
<i>~ Say night, night, night and kiss me ~</i>

01:49.580 --> 01:53.255
<i>~ Just hold me tight</i>
<i>and tell me you'll miss me ~</i>

01:53.460 --> 01:57.373
<i>~ While I'm alone how blue I can be ~</i>

01:57.580 --> 02:01.619
<i>~ Dream a little dream of me ~</i>

02:01.820 --> 02:05.779
<i>~ Stars fading but I linger on, dear ~</i>

02:05.980 --> 02:10.053
<i>- ~ Still craving your kiss... ~</i>
- That's better.

02:23.599 --> 02:27.529
That's the best backhand I've ever seen
on Thorazine. Want another one?

02:28.930 --> 02:30.568
Time for group, William.

02:35.930 --> 02:39.684
You could lose your privileges
right there, Mr Caufield.

02:44.370 --> 02:46.645
I'll be consulting with Dr Weitzman.

02:53.810 --> 02:58.440
OK, Kenny. Put your game face on.
Here we go.

02:58.650 --> 02:59.844
Ready?

03:02.210 --> 03:04.644
I've played some of
the top Chinese guys.

03:04.850 --> 03:07.683
If you ever work up a serve
to go with that backhand,

03:07.890 --> 03:10.768
it's gonna be a dark day
in Peking, babe.

03:12.090 --> 03:14.888
Want to practise more?

03:15.090 --> 03:18.048
Here we go. Attaboy.

03:18.250 --> 03:21.606
Now focus, all right? Attaboy.

03:28.810 --> 03:30.243
Perfect.

03:30.450 --> 03:38.164
<i> ~ Does that</i>
<i>star-spangled banner yet wave... ~</i>

03:38.370 --> 03:46.527
- Ianuzzi.
<i>- ~ O'er the land of the free ~</i>

03:46.730 --> 03:50.405
<i>~ And the home ~</i>

03:50.610 --> 03:56.287
<i>~ Of the brave ~</i>

03:58.730 --> 04:01.403
<i> Holy cow, White,</i>
<i>what a great day for a game.</i>

04:01.610 --> 04:04.602
Holy cow, White,
what a great day for a game.

04:04.810 --> 04:06.801
Albert. Group.

04:08.050 --> 04:10.689
<i>Now the line-ups</i>
<i>for the Orioles and the Yankees.</i>

04:10.890 --> 04:14.280
<i>John Candeleria</i>
<i>and Jeff Ballard are pitching.</i>

04:14.490 --> 04:17.163
<i>Paul Baltimore leading off</i>
<i>playing left field,</i>

04:17.370 --> 04:19.600
<i>batting second, Billy Ripcon.</i>

04:19.810 --> 04:22.608
<i>- Cal Ripcon Jr...</i>
- Albert.

04:22.810 --> 04:25.244
That's Brian's cupcake.

04:53.770 --> 04:55.726
McDermott, time for group.

05:02.450 --> 05:04.964
That is a serious infraction
of hospital rules.

05:05.170 --> 05:09.607
This is the body and blood
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.085
And a damn fine Beaujolais.

05:19.290 --> 05:20.882
You're naked.

05:21.090 --> 05:24.127
We are all naked
in the eyes of the Lord.

05:24.330 --> 05:26.764
I'll include this
in my report to Dr Weitzman.

05:26.970 --> 05:30.280
Call not for a doctor
but for an elder of the church.

05:30.490 --> 05:32.799
Leviticus, 5-14.

05:37.370 --> 05:39.122
I told you.

05:48.410 --> 05:51.004
- Tortured soul.
- I know what you mean, Doc.

06:11.690 --> 06:13.885
There's a tendency
to limit medication.

06:14.090 --> 06:17.799
I've looked at the chart. The general
anxiety level in the Gomez case

06:18.010 --> 06:19.966
indicates minor dosage increase.

06:20.170 --> 06:22.889
I'm gonna say
25 milligrams Amitriptyline.

06:23.090 --> 06:26.002
25 milligrams won't make a dent
in Gomez. I'd go 50.

06:26.210 --> 06:29.168
He cried during <i>Family Feud</i> last night.

06:29.370 --> 06:32.123
- Shouldn't you be in group?
- I don't like it in there.

06:32.330 --> 06:36.005
- They're hostile towards authority.
- You better get in there.

06:36.210 --> 06:40.328
Oh, OK. I'll keep an eye on them.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.805
Henry.

06:43.010 --> 06:44.887
I'm not finished with that.

06:51.810 --> 06:54.005
Looked just like mine.

07:04.290 --> 07:06.645
These chairs are all wrong.

07:06.850 --> 07:11.287
I can't leave you guys alone for two
minutes. You're facing the wrong way.

07:11.490 --> 07:13.924
Nobody doesn't like Sara Lee.

07:14.130 --> 07:16.644
Don't you know what a semicircle is?

07:20.050 --> 07:23.725
I don't want him next to me.
He smells like tuna fish.

07:27.810 --> 07:30.005
Look what you did.

07:35.050 --> 07:37.120
Four minutes and 27 seconds.

07:37.330 --> 07:40.640
Some patients just make a therapist
want to shake his head.

07:44.210 --> 07:47.327
Straighten out that chair.

07:47.530 --> 07:52.081
Imagine this. My chair is straight and
all the other chairs are out of order.

07:52.290 --> 07:55.999
- There's a mind-bender for you.
- You're living in a fantasy world.

07:56.210 --> 07:58.519
Dr Weitzman is not gonna like this.

07:58.730 --> 08:01.449
Group will not start
until you straighten that chair.

08:01.650 --> 08:03.959
All right.
I didn't want to have to do this.

08:04.170 --> 08:06.843
I've been put in charge of this group.

08:07.050 --> 08:09.280
American Psychiatric Society.

08:09.490 --> 08:11.958
- Let me see that.
- No, sorry. It's classified.

08:12.170 --> 08:14.240
I know your fantasies when I hear them.

08:14.450 --> 08:17.965
If you don't straighten out that chair,
I'll straighten if out for you.

08:20.890 --> 08:23.199
All right.

08:27.690 --> 08:29.965
I'll straighten out the chair.

08:41.289 --> 08:44.202
Looks like one of our chairs
tried to make a break for it.

08:44.410 --> 08:47.561
Billy did it, Dr Weitzman.
It'll all be in my report.

08:48.810 --> 08:52.041
Look, you're all feeling
a little bit on edge these days.

08:52.250 --> 08:55.606
It's very normal
when you're coming off medication. Bill.

08:56.850 --> 09:01.082
But you've got to believe me.
These chairs are innocent.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.166
Hi, Albert. Sit down, Bill.

09:08.810 --> 09:10.402
Come on.

09:10.610 --> 09:12.840
OK, team.

09:13.050 --> 09:15.484
Henry, would you
take the jacket off, please?

09:17.010 --> 09:20.719
And put the clipboard away.
We're gonna be using my notes.

09:41.850 --> 09:44.523
Good. Thank you.

09:44.730 --> 09:47.403
OK. Who wants to start?

09:47.610 --> 09:50.204
Do you want to talk about
what just happened here?

09:53.050 --> 09:56.247
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I just flashed back to 'Nam.

09:56.450 --> 09:59.601
- You never made it to Vietnam.
- He was too violent for Vietnam.

09:59.810 --> 10:03.280
I wish you'd use
your imagination and write again.

10:03.490 --> 10:08.405
Doc, I get up, I take a shower, I put on
my clothes. What do you want from me?

10:08.610 --> 10:12.000
We talked about
trying to accept reality as it is,

10:12.210 --> 10:14.007
and not make it up as you go along.

10:14.210 --> 10:18.283
William can't expect to make any
progress. He never reads my reports.

10:18.530 --> 10:20.486
No wonder he's never done anything.

10:21.690 --> 10:23.681
I finished second at Daytona.

10:23.890 --> 10:26.529
Speeding tickets
don't make you a race car driver.

10:26.730 --> 10:29.164
You said you played
for the New York Rangers.

10:29.370 --> 10:31.486
Are you saying I didn't?

10:31.690 --> 10:34.488
Attacking a referee
doesn't make you a hockey player.

10:34.690 --> 10:38.842
- He had no right to be an NHL referee.
- But it did get you into our group.

10:39.050 --> 10:42.486
I say we skip him and move onto
someone of greater consequence.

10:42.690 --> 10:45.762
We'll be with you in a minute, Jack.
All right, Bill.

10:45.970 --> 10:48.404
Let's review some of our goals
from last time.

10:48.610 --> 10:50.840
OK.

10:51.050 --> 10:54.360
What about my new goal? Daryl Hannah.

10:57.570 --> 11:00.403
Can we just stay out of fantasy
for just a minute please?

11:00.610 --> 11:02.885
How about a relationship
with a regular girl?

11:03.090 --> 11:05.729
Let me out of here
so I can find a regular girl.

11:05.930 --> 11:08.205
Nurse Kremmel looks like Luca Brasi.

11:08.410 --> 11:12.608
- All God's creatures are beautiful.
- Not her.

11:14.250 --> 11:16.923
- No. Not her.
- Dr Weitzman.

11:17.130 --> 11:21.328
I think we should devote
this entire session to William.

11:21.530 --> 11:26.081
Can we take another vote on Henry's
lobotomy? Let me have a show of hands.

11:26.290 --> 11:28.360
That was never discussed, was it?

11:28.570 --> 11:30.845
- You can vote too.
- I'm not gonna vote.

11:31.050 --> 11:33.610
Put your hand down, Jack.

11:35.690 --> 11:37.965
We had a majority.

11:43.530 --> 11:46.488
OK. Jack. Last time
we had you set a goal for yourself.

11:46.690 --> 11:50.649
My original goal was to rid my agency
of Satan's influence,

11:50.850 --> 11:55.366
and to bring Jesus Christ back
into advertising, where he belongs.

11:56.410 --> 11:58.640
Yes, but the revised goal
we talked about

11:58.850 --> 12:01.410
was finding a position
for Jack McDermott.

12:01.690 --> 12:06.047
Dr Weitzman, he's still walking around
naked. He has a long way to go.

12:06.250 --> 12:08.400
He runs the universe but he's scared.

12:08.610 --> 12:10.487
That's my diagnosis too.

12:10.690 --> 12:12.999
You raised yourself
from the dead, right?

12:13.210 --> 12:16.919
Did the agency give you extra perks
with that or just those three days off?

12:17.130 --> 12:21.601
You weren't there.
I was pulling down 100 big ones a year

12:21.810 --> 12:25.086
when you and Satan
were out chasing Daryl Hannah.

12:25.290 --> 12:29.966
Do I sense some hostility here?
Maybe they should role-play this.

12:30.170 --> 12:34.800
- You want to talk about this, Jack?
- I was senior VP.

12:35.010 --> 12:39.128
I had a corner office.
But they crucified me.

12:40.850 --> 12:45.048
You're doing great, Jack.
It takes time but you're doing great.

12:46.610 --> 12:48.566
Yes, Henry.

12:49.970 --> 12:54.202
Great. I've been waiting for this
all morning. Dr Demento speaks.

12:57.250 --> 12:59.206
On the first Monday of every month,

12:59.410 --> 13:02.163
it is my intention to submit to you,
Dr Weitzman,

13:02.370 --> 13:05.646
a complete report
of all infractions of hospital rules.

13:06.970 --> 13:09.279
Particularly by these patients.

13:13.810 --> 13:16.688
Who's gonna do the report on you,
you jerk-off?

13:16.890 --> 13:19.768
- See what I'm up against?
- He's worse than I am.

13:19.970 --> 13:24.248
We're all in this together. That's
what this group is about. We're a team.

13:24.450 --> 13:27.169
Exactly. But these idiots
don't understand that.

13:27.370 --> 13:31.204
Yeah. Henry, would you mind
if I made a small observation?

13:31.410 --> 13:34.208
Just listen to it. Leave the clipboard.

13:34.410 --> 13:37.208
I know you're trying to be helpful,
and we appreciate it,

13:37.410 --> 13:42.279
but focusing on other people's problems
is just a way of avoiding your own.

13:42.490 --> 13:45.527
- Exactly.
- Fine. So let's talk about you.

13:45.730 --> 13:48.688
I have seven letters
from your wife in my office.

13:48.890 --> 13:51.120
She hasn't heard from you
in a year and a half.

13:51.330 --> 13:54.845
- I don't want to talk about that.
- It's safe in here.

13:55.050 --> 13:57.280
We're all here for you.

13:57.490 --> 14:00.368
Everything is so disorganised.
Such a mess.

14:00.570 --> 14:04.802
Reality is messy, Henry. But that's OK.
It's not for you to clean it up.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.399
Who else is gonna do it? Not these guys.

14:07.610 --> 14:11.319
It's tough to take orders
from a guy who irons his socks.

14:11.530 --> 14:14.044
Why don't you do me a favour, Henry?

14:15.410 --> 14:17.844
Uh-uh! I don't want you to pick it up.

14:18.050 --> 14:21.520
I don't want you to think about it.
It's not your responsibility.

14:28.370 --> 14:29.723
Good.

14:29.930 --> 14:33.525
Next week we'll work on leaving the rest
of the world's paper where it is.

14:33.730 --> 14:35.641
You're gonna find out that chaos is OK.

14:35.850 --> 14:37.761
Chaos is great.

14:41.730 --> 14:43.880
Can we go now?

14:44.090 --> 14:47.400
Every week you say that
and I say we haven't heard from Albert.

14:47.610 --> 14:50.727
Nobody has. I've had better
conversations with cheese.

14:50.930 --> 14:53.683
This is Albert's way
of dealing with things right now.

14:53.890 --> 14:56.688
- Sit down. Come on.
- This is not OK.

14:56.890 --> 15:00.087
- What's that?
- This is Brian's cupcake.

15:00.290 --> 15:04.044
Every day an innocent man is deprived
of his dessert and we do nothing.

15:04.250 --> 15:06.684
Ooh! You could
do some time for that, Big Al.

15:06.890 --> 15:10.963
Oh, boy! Brian's cupcake!
Let's beat the shit out of him.

15:11.170 --> 15:16.085
Guys, Brian isn't complaining,
so let's just drop it, all right?

15:16.290 --> 15:18.963
Don't worry about the cupcake.

15:19.170 --> 15:23.561
You were gonna work on saying the names
of the guys in the group. You wanna try?

15:23.770 --> 15:27.160
Billy, Henry, Jack, Dr Weitzman.
Do you want to try?

15:32.930 --> 15:35.649
Strike three, Doc.
There's no joy in Mudville.

15:35.850 --> 15:38.205
Three weeks ago,
before we came off medication,

15:38.410 --> 15:40.878
Albert wasn't trying to communicate.

15:41.090 --> 15:43.240
At least we now know
that he's listening.

15:43.450 --> 15:45.918
Yeah. To Phil Rizzuto.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.879
All right. Time's up.

15:51.090 --> 15:53.968
Jack, Henry, Billy, Albert. Come on.

15:58.810 --> 16:01.608
OK. Is this the week
that you guys finally break down

16:01.810 --> 16:03.926
and give each other a little hug?

16:04.130 --> 16:06.690
Huh, team? Huh?

16:11.410 --> 16:13.366
I don't think this is the week, Doc.

16:15.850 --> 16:18.364
I might have some good news
about our field trip.

16:18.570 --> 16:20.959
I put in for some passes
for the Yankee game

16:21.170 --> 16:23.286
and I'm gonna find out this afternoon.

16:25.010 --> 16:26.887
How does that sound?

16:30.530 --> 16:32.361
You were all excited before.

16:32.570 --> 16:35.960
Does that mean we're actually leaving
the hospital grounds?

16:36.170 --> 16:38.559
No, the Yankees
are gonna come here and play.

16:38.770 --> 16:42.080
They're gonna throw some lights up
in the rec room. What a stroker.

16:42.290 --> 16:46.920
Doc, is there any possibility that
Albert will actually get into the game?

16:47.130 --> 16:51.567
- See action, I mean.
- We'll keep you on the bench this time.

16:53.090 --> 16:54.682
Did my best.

16:55.050 --> 16:57.883
This is the group
that you want to take out tomorrow.

16:58.090 --> 17:00.206
You got some pretty chronic types here.

17:00.410 --> 17:02.480
I didn't pick the group out of a hat.

17:02.690 --> 17:05.840
- And I'm seeing progress.
- Like breaking windows?

17:06.050 --> 17:10.487
They're bickering. They're annoying
the hell out of each other. It's great.

17:10.690 --> 17:13.409
Throw four dogs in a room,
they'll fight.

17:13.609 --> 17:15.566
They're standing up for themselves.

17:15.770 --> 17:18.000
Their real identities
are creeping back.

17:18.210 --> 17:20.326
Jeff, some of the staff seem to feel

17:20.530 --> 17:22.680
this trip is more trouble
than it's worth.

17:22.890 --> 17:27.008
One of these patients has not been
outside an institution in twelve years.

17:27.210 --> 17:31.840
And Caufield is like a walking time
bomb. You can hear him ticking.

17:32.050 --> 17:36.760
You turn around and he'll be out
kicking dirt on an umpire.

17:36.970 --> 17:39.882
Why can't you just watch the game on TV
in the rec room?

17:40.090 --> 17:45.562
One more afternoon in the rec room, I'm
gonna have to go on Thorazine myself.

17:45.770 --> 17:48.125
You've got a sense of humour about this.

17:48.330 --> 17:50.764
I find it difficult to sanction this.

17:50.970 --> 17:54.167
It's a five-hour field trip.
We're not going up Everest.

17:54.370 --> 17:56.565
I think Jeff is over-dramatising this.

17:56.770 --> 17:58.601
Watching Albert dying is drama.

17:58.810 --> 18:01.404
- Oh, come on.
- Nobody's dying in here.

18:01.610 --> 18:06.684
Look, if these guys are gonna spend the
rest of their lives in an institution,

18:06.890 --> 18:09.927
I want to give them a chance
to taste a hot dog at Yankee Stadium

18:10.130 --> 18:12.519
or hear the crowd roar
when Mattingly hits one out.

18:12.730 --> 18:15.483
That's got to be worth
a couple of hours of my time.

18:18.250 --> 18:22.084
I'm not sure what the therapeutic value
of a ballpark frank is

18:22.290 --> 18:24.326
for four psychotics.

19:04.690 --> 19:06.203
Yes?

19:06.410 --> 19:09.447
Henry. We got it.

19:11.130 --> 19:13.963
Doctor, do you think
the other patients are ready?

19:14.170 --> 19:16.479
Sure.

19:16.690 --> 19:18.999
Is that the correct time?

19:20.770 --> 19:22.886
<i> We see a church that is weak,</i>

19:23.090 --> 19:25.240
<i>a church that has lost its way!</i>

19:25.450 --> 19:28.487
<i>We see Christians</i>
<i>who do not know who they are.</i>

19:32.370 --> 19:34.520
Box seats on the right field line.

19:34.730 --> 19:37.847
- Will the atheists be there?
- We'll all be there.

19:38.050 --> 19:39.881
All the faiths will be represented.

19:41.450 --> 19:43.805
It's gonna be great, Jack.

19:44.010 --> 19:46.843
<i>... they will suffer.</i>

19:47.050 --> 19:49.006
You are a lot better than that guy.

19:49.210 --> 19:51.485
Yeah.

19:54.530 --> 19:59.968
<i>A fella ain't got a soul of his own,</i>
<i>just a little piece of a big soul.</i>

20:00.170 --> 20:02.400
<i>The one big soul</i>
<i>that belongs to everybody.</i>

20:03.890 --> 20:07.360
<i>- Then...</i>
<i>- Then what, Tom?</i>

20:07.570 --> 20:09.720
<i>Then it don't matter.</i>

20:09.930 --> 20:13.127
<i>I'll be all around in the dark.</i>

20:13.330 --> 20:16.766
<i>I'll be everywhere.</i>
<i>Wherever you can look.</i>

20:18.410 --> 20:21.561
<i>Wherever there's a fight</i>
<i>so hungry people can eat,</i>

20:21.770 --> 20:23.726
<i>I'll be there.</i>

20:23.930 --> 20:27.002
Wherever there's a cop beating up a guy,

20:27.210 --> 20:29.280
I'll be there.

20:29.490 --> 20:32.163
That's one of my favourite scenes
of all time.

20:33.890 --> 20:36.529
Makes me want to puke.

20:36.730 --> 20:41.201
Come on. You were right there
in that dust bowl with them.

20:41.410 --> 20:44.527
You know, you are
one of the last of the great idealists.

20:44.730 --> 20:47.881
On this floor, that's really something.

20:51.130 --> 20:53.200
What brings you up here, Doc?

20:53.410 --> 20:55.605
Oh. Um... we're going
to the game tomorrow.

20:57.330 --> 20:59.525
- We're going with the veggies?
- Yeah.

21:01.370 --> 21:04.680
Oh, there's about 65,000 seats
up at that stadium.

21:05.770 --> 21:09.649
But don't get your hopes up,
because they're all screwed down.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.918
It's great to be young and insane.

22:01.330 --> 22:05.005
The kitchen made us some brownies.
You're in charge of passing them out.

22:05.210 --> 22:07.201
Then none for
the Bishop of Bullshit.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.560
Guys, a little pocket money.

22:09.770 --> 22:14.480
You each get $10
for hot dogs at the stadium.

22:14.690 --> 22:16.885
Alcohol for the unstable. I love it.

22:17.090 --> 22:19.081
No beer, Bill. Just sodas.

22:19.290 --> 22:21.929
Dr Weitzman, I think it's best
that I hold the money.

22:22.130 --> 22:26.089
We don't want any wild shopping spree
that might embarrass the hospital.

22:26.290 --> 22:29.646
I drove the money lenders from the
temple. I can handle a ten-spot.

22:29.850 --> 22:34.685
Now for the Yankees number ten,
Alexander Hamilton.

22:36.450 --> 22:40.159
If you want to eat yours before we get
to the stadium, that's your decision.

22:40.370 --> 22:42.964
But those dogs out there
are worth the wait.

22:45.570 --> 22:48.038
All right. Let's go.

22:50.330 --> 22:52.764
- I'm riding up front!
- I can't ride in the back!

22:52.970 --> 22:54.961
- I get carsick!
- Come on!

22:55.170 --> 22:58.048
I'm not going! That maniac took my seat!

22:59.890 --> 23:03.929
All right. Jack, I promised Henry
that he could navigate.

23:06.810 --> 23:10.598
OK. I'll let you ride up front
on the way back, all right?

23:10.810 --> 23:13.608
Thank you. OK? You all right?

23:13.810 --> 23:17.280
OK. Good. You all right?

23:31.010 --> 23:33.080
Come on, Rizzuto.

24:03.250 --> 24:06.526
Mileage at gate -
97,411 and 2/10ths miles.

24:06.730 --> 24:08.846
Thank you, Henry.

24:21.450 --> 24:23.918
Beautiful day for the game, guys.

24:26.370 --> 24:29.726
Don't get nervous. We've got
two wide lanes. Plenty of room.

24:29.930 --> 24:32.967
No worse than the cafeteria
at lunch time, huh, Albert?

24:33.170 --> 24:35.525
Close call, close call.

24:35.730 --> 24:39.086
When we get to the stadium, guys,
we're gonna use the buddy system.

24:39.290 --> 24:41.645
You might want to explain that to Henry.

24:41.850 --> 24:46.321
I don't need an explanation.
I just don't fraternise with patients.

24:46.530 --> 24:50.284
I didn't have any buddies when I was
on the cross. I don't need one now.

24:50.490 --> 24:55.518
Guys, let's lighten up. We're going
to a baseball game. Come on.

24:55.730 --> 25:00.679
Let's get down! OK, here we go.

25:00.890 --> 25:03.165
<i>~ Hit the road, Jack... ~</i>

25:03.370 --> 25:05.964
Everybody. Come on.

25:06.170 --> 25:10.402
<i>~ Hit the road, Jack,</i>
<i>and don't you come back no more ~</i>

25:10.610 --> 25:12.840
<i>~ What you say?</i>
<i>Hit the road, Jack ~</i>

25:13.050 --> 25:16.679
<i>~ And don't you come back</i>
<i>no more, no more, no more, no more ~</i>

25:16.890 --> 25:21.327
<i>~ Hit the road, Jack,</i>
<i>and don't you come back no more ~</i>

25:22.250 --> 25:24.764
<i>~ Oh, woman, oh, woman,</i>
<i>don't you treat me so mean ~</i>

25:24.970 --> 25:27.609
<i>~ You're the meanest old woman</i>
<i>that I ever have seen ~</i>

25:27.810 --> 25:32.088
<i>~ I guess if you say so,</i>
<i>I'll just pack my bags and go ~</i>

25:32.290 --> 25:34.201
<i>~ That's right, hit the road, Jack ~</i>

25:34.410 --> 25:38.085
<i>~ And don't you come back</i>
<i>no more, no more, no more, no more ~</i>

25:38.290 --> 25:42.169
<i>~ Hit the road, Jack,</i>
<i>and don't you come back no more... ~</i>

25:42.370 --> 25:44.679
There it is, guys. New York.

25:44.890 --> 25:47.199
Some kind of town.

25:47.410 --> 25:50.880
See those two towers over there?
World Trade Center.

25:51.090 --> 25:53.206
I was the architectural consultant.

25:53.410 --> 25:56.846
They just wanted to put up one.
I said, "Hey, throw the other one up."

25:57.050 --> 25:59.518
- Turned out nice, didn't it?
- Fantasy.

26:02.250 --> 26:05.003
- Holland Tunnel next right.
- Good work, Henry.

26:05.210 --> 26:10.842
<i>~ Well, I guess if you say so,</i>
<i>I'll have to pack my things and go... ~</i>

26:11.050 --> 26:13.883
We directly under
the Hudson River now.

26:14.090 --> 26:17.048
You guys see
all those individual tiles up there?

26:18.290 --> 26:21.327
Isn't it true that even one
of those tiles were to come loose

26:21.530 --> 26:24.488
millions of gallons of water
would come pouring down on us

26:24.690 --> 26:26.999
and squash us like tiny little bugs?

26:28.450 --> 26:32.728
- Is that a leak? They're leaking!
- All right, Bill.

26:32.930 --> 26:36.002
- I will hold back the water.
- Bill, cut it out.

26:40.010 --> 26:43.559
<i>~ Open the door, get on the floor</i>
<i>Everybody walk the dinosaur ~</i>

26:43.770 --> 26:47.524
<i>~ Open the door, get on the floor</i>
<i>Everybody walk the dinosaur ~</i>

26:47.730 --> 26:51.609
<i>~ Open the door, get on the floor</i>

26:51.810 --> 26:55.439
<i>~ Open the door, get on the floor</i>

26:55.650 --> 26:59.689

<i>Boom boom acka-lacka boom boom ~</i>

26:59.890 --> 27:02.882
<i>~ Boom boom acka-lacka lacka boom</i>
<i>Boom boom acka-lacka boom boom ~</i>

27:07.130 --> 27:11.282

27:11.490 --> 27:15.278

27:15.490 --> 27:18.926
<i>~ You fell asleep, I stayed awake</i>

27:19.130 --> 27:21.883

<i>~ Open the door, get on the floor</i>
<i>Everybody walk the dinosaur... ~</i>

27:47.490 --> 27:50.607
Albert's gotta go, Albert's gotta go.

27:50.810 --> 27:54.723
He's gonna piss all over the seat, Doc.
We'll need a canoe to float out.

27:54.930 --> 27:57.683
He drank a whole can
of Hawaiian punch before we left.

27:57.890 --> 27:59.926
Albert, do you think you can hold on?

28:00.130 --> 28:04.408
- Batter up. Batter up.
- I think that means no, Doc.

28:04.610 --> 28:08.523
Just hold on a second. Easy does it
till we find a place, all right?

28:22.610 --> 28:24.999
Excuse me. Can I have the key
to the men's room?

28:25.210 --> 28:26.768
<i>No habla InglÃ©s.</i>

28:26.970 --> 28:30.519
<i>Uh. Por favor, senor, los cles...</i>

28:30.730 --> 28:33.198
I don't speak Spanish either.
Piss in the alley.

28:33.410 --> 28:35.207
Come on, man. We'll just be a minute.

28:35.410 --> 28:38.129
The toilet's broke, alley works.

28:39.330 --> 28:41.446
Thank you. Have a nice day.

28:41.650 --> 28:43.880
Come on, Albert. Let's go.

28:51.690 --> 28:54.204
OK, come on.

28:54.410 --> 28:57.049
No ghost stories, OK, Billy?

28:57.250 --> 28:59.718
All right. Let's go. Come on.

29:02.370 --> 29:06.522
What the hell was that?
Did you guys hear that?

29:06.730 --> 29:09.290
Like a wild dog howling or something?

29:10.530 --> 29:13.681
Maybe it was me. I always get
really scared when I'm down here.

29:13.890 --> 29:16.245
Did you guys see <i>Wolfen?</i>
They filmed it here.

29:16.450 --> 29:19.806
That movie about those gigantic wolves
that come out at night

29:20.010 --> 29:22.319
and they eat people
and rip their guts open

29:22.530 --> 29:25.363
and they've got this shit
hanging out of their mouth.

29:25.570 --> 29:28.403
People would live,
like, for an hour later.

29:28.610 --> 29:32.285
They'd just lay there
and twitch and stuff.

29:33.690 --> 29:35.681
They shot it right down here.

29:35.890 --> 29:38.643
You know why?
This is exactly where it happened.

29:38.850 --> 29:42.206
That was a true story.
Those wolves actually happened.

29:52.490 --> 29:54.799
OK, champ. This is gonna have to do.

29:59.690 --> 30:01.681
Careful.

30:01.890 --> 30:04.279
How about right here? This is fine.

30:13.650 --> 30:15.527
What?

30:15.730 --> 30:19.166
OK. I won't look. I'm not looking.

30:34.130 --> 30:36.519
OK, Albert. Are you done yet?

30:40.730 --> 30:42.766
Albert?

30:45.810 --> 30:47.880
Al?

30:49.850 --> 30:51.283
Albert.

31:00.130 --> 31:02.360
You should have wised up, Alvarez.

31:02.570 --> 31:04.162
You're going to jail!

31:04.370 --> 31:06.964
- Nobody's going to jail.
- You bastard!

31:07.170 --> 31:09.240
Say good night.

31:09.450 --> 31:11.406
- Don't!
- You're a dead man, Alvarez.

31:15.290 --> 31:16.803
Albert!

31:17.010 --> 31:19.444
Hey! Who the hell are you?

31:19.650 --> 31:21.766
Stop that guy!

31:30.330 --> 31:32.685
Hey, what the hell's
going on down there?

31:36.050 --> 31:38.041
<i>Mira! Mira!</i>

32:02.930 --> 32:05.649
<i>... in</i> broad daylight,
you know what I'm saying?

32:11.730 --> 32:14.290
- What happened?
- He got the crap kicked out of him.

32:14.490 --> 32:16.481
- Is he gonna make it?
- Who knows?

32:54.450 --> 32:56.520
Where the hell did you go? Moscow?

32:56.730 --> 32:58.766
Where's Dr Weitzman, Albert?

32:58.970 --> 33:02.519
He'll be here in a minute.
We're on a very tight schedule.

33:05.410 --> 33:08.686
How do you like the game so far?
I'm having a ball.

33:09.970 --> 33:14.248
Good seats, huh? It's funny
the hot dog guy hasn't been around.

33:14.450 --> 33:16.406
Albert! Where's the doctor?

33:18.050 --> 33:20.723
- News At Eleven.
- Tell us now.

33:22.330 --> 33:23.922
Now...

33:25.530 --> 33:27.486
a word from our sponsor.

33:30.890 --> 33:33.802
We're waiting for a news update
from a catatonic.

33:34.010 --> 33:36.240
Maybe he didn't really want to take us.

33:36.450 --> 33:40.409
I wouldn't want to walk into a place
with a bunch of schizophrenics.

33:40.610 --> 33:43.170
I've never agreed with that diagnosis.

33:44.170 --> 33:46.161
Oh, really?

33:46.370 --> 33:50.488
Well, coming from a guy who carries
a picture of Norman Bates in his wallet,

33:50.690 --> 33:53.045
that doesn't mean too much.
Trust me on this one.

33:53.250 --> 33:55.081
You are nuts. You shut up!

33:55.290 --> 33:57.485
Don't touch it.

34:02.650 --> 34:06.563
What about dinner?
Who's gonna get us our dinner?

34:06.770 --> 34:10.319
Aren't you the same guy
that changed water into wine?

34:10.530 --> 34:11.929
Huh? JC?

34:12.130 --> 34:15.520
Isn't the son of God good for a burger?
You get us something.

34:15.730 --> 34:19.563
That's not funny.
You're a very disturbed young man.

34:19.770 --> 34:23.478
You don't know how disturbed I am. I'm
so disturbed I'm getting out of here.

34:23.690 --> 34:26.841
- You don't have permission.
- I'm giving myself permission.

34:27.050 --> 34:30.326
I'm the doctor
until the doctor comes back!

34:30.530 --> 34:35.001
Fine. You be the doctor and I'll be
the escaped mental patient, OK?

34:36.449 --> 34:41.649
I'm telling Dr Weitzman. And Dr Newald.

34:43.530 --> 34:47.125
One away. Next batter.

34:48.489 --> 34:52.880
Dr Newald's going to be very upset.
I'll have to make a full report.

34:53.090 --> 34:55.967
You're a sick man.
It's a sickness of the soul.

34:56.170 --> 34:58.889
Put this in your report.

34:59.090 --> 35:01.445
Foul ball.

35:01.650 --> 35:04.528
It's clear to me now. God is testing me.

35:04.730 --> 35:06.846
You can't go anywhere!

35:07.050 --> 35:09.280
You're having a psychotic episode.

35:09.490 --> 35:11.560
That automatically puts me in charge.

35:11.770 --> 35:17.049
I am the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not
have strange gods before me.

35:17.250 --> 35:19.480
Out of my way, asshole.

35:31.250 --> 35:34.003
I feel my doctor
may have been seized by the Romans!

35:59.690 --> 36:01.806
Who's gonna take us back?

36:02.010 --> 36:04.365
We're gonna be late for group.

36:05.410 --> 36:08.447
Albert, sit up straight.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.920
That's good.

36:14.130 --> 36:16.724
The doctor will be back any minute now.

36:16.930 --> 36:19.967
We've got a lot to talk about tonight.

36:23.690 --> 36:25.681
I better check
to see what's keeping him.

36:29.210 --> 36:32.247
Albert, keep this door locked.

37:13.530 --> 37:15.521
Give me a beer.

37:26.490 --> 37:29.766
She won't give us her phone number.
Should we refuse to pay?

37:29.970 --> 37:31.926
We can't until she does.

37:32.130 --> 37:34.166
We're just trying
to set you up for life.

37:34.370 --> 37:37.089
This man could have
any woman in the world.

37:37.290 --> 37:42.318
But tonight, maybe it's the moon, or
those cute little knockers you've got...

37:42.530 --> 37:45.408
Sorry. He only wants one thing.

37:45.610 --> 37:48.249
- Good. Here it is.
- Come on.

37:48.450 --> 37:51.726
Why don't you go out with a guy
who makes more than minimum wage?

37:51.930 --> 37:55.525
Listen, boys, this isn't Club Med.
Do you mind just paying the check?

37:55.730 --> 38:00.246
Whoa. Are you rejecting him?
You're gonna give this guy a complex.

38:00.450 --> 38:02.884
- Let go.
- Give me one good reason.

38:03.090 --> 38:06.127
- I'll give you a reason.
- What's your problem?

38:10.970 --> 38:14.883
They call it
a low frustration tolerance.

38:15.090 --> 38:18.366
- I hate paisley.
- Please don't. It's not worth it.

38:18.570 --> 38:20.640
Who the hell do you think you are?

38:25.170 --> 38:28.606
I'm an escaped mental patient
with a history of violence.

38:30.330 --> 38:31.604
Check, please.

38:36.610 --> 38:40.922
- Now pay the lady. OK?
- Sure.

38:45.930 --> 38:48.046
You've got something right here.

38:53.290 --> 38:57.363
Restaurant security. Just a minor
utensil violation. Enjoy your dinner.

39:01.570 --> 39:05.279
Sue, cover for me. I gotta go.

39:08.890 --> 39:10.482
Hey.

39:19.210 --> 39:21.929
- This is crazy.
- I can relate to that.

39:23.290 --> 39:27.761
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm out. It was a clerical mistake.

39:27.970 --> 39:30.643
They threw me a party and here I am.

39:30.850 --> 39:33.318
Billy, I haven't talked to you
in three months.

39:33.530 --> 39:35.839
Could we try a little reality here?

39:36.050 --> 39:38.962
OK. It's not my strength but...

39:58.330 --> 40:01.367
I could report this!
We have rules around here, buddy!

40:06.450 --> 40:08.725
My God!

40:22.410 --> 40:27.928
All right. Vehicle 9415.

40:29.690 --> 40:34.889
This is going to look
very, very, very good for you, my man.

40:59.130 --> 41:02.964
<i>~ Sun comes burning down,</i>
<i>sun comes burning ~</i>

41:07.330 --> 41:09.446

42:23.130 --> 42:26.088
Excuse me, sir.
I'm looking for a colleague of mine.

42:26.290 --> 42:30.408
Excuse me. I'm looking for my colleague,
Dr Jeffrey Weitzman.

42:30.610 --> 42:34.205
Excuse me.
Can you help me? I'm looking for a...

42:34.410 --> 42:38.926
Excuse me. I'm looking for my colleague,
Dr Jeffrey Weitzman.

42:39.130 --> 42:41.724
Never heard of him.

42:41.930 --> 42:46.003
Hey! I think we should
talk about this, don't you?

42:46.210 --> 42:48.246
Not really.

42:48.450 --> 42:51.328
Well, well, well.

42:51.530 --> 42:55.045
Don't say I didn't give you
every opportunity to tell your side.

43:17.530 --> 43:22.046
Two Rum Collins, two Jack Daniels,
one on the rocks, and a Heineken.

43:25.290 --> 43:26.518
What'll it be?

43:26.730 --> 43:30.803
Two Rum Collins, two Jack Daniels,
one on the rocks, and a Heineken.

43:32.370 --> 43:33.849
Please.

43:38.970 --> 43:41.040
Hi.

43:41.250 --> 43:44.686
What's the matter?
Are you afraid of me or something?

43:49.570 --> 43:52.038
Hey, baby, wanna have a good time?

43:59.930 --> 44:01.488
How're you doin'?

44:01.690 --> 44:03.681
Three and two. Bases loaded.

44:03.890 --> 44:07.246
<i>- Gotta make him swing.</i>
- Gotta make him swing.

44:07.450 --> 44:09.759
<i>- Leiter winds.</i>
- Leiter winds.

44:09.970 --> 44:14.998
<i>- Huckleberry went for a bad pitch.</i>
- Huckleberry went for a bad pitch.

44:15.210 --> 44:19.761
Leiter's unbelievable. Man could throw
a lamb chop past a goddamn wolf.

44:28.930 --> 44:31.524
Hey! Watch it!
What's the matter with you?

44:35.410 --> 44:37.526
Organisation is the key.

44:37.730 --> 44:41.928
US Postal Service. I handled one of
the toughest zip codes in the country.

44:42.130 --> 44:44.883
Ask anyone in 10021
about Henry Sikorsky.

44:48.650 --> 44:50.880
Would you mind cleaning up your area?

44:51.090 --> 44:53.888
No one likes a Mr Messy.

44:54.090 --> 44:56.604
Fuck you.

44:56.810 --> 45:00.439
- He refuses to clean up his area.
- Leave me alone, jerk-off.

45:02.290 --> 45:04.963
Do I sense some hostility here?

45:05.930 --> 45:10.401
Why don't we bring this up in group?
Or maybe we should just hug.

45:18.490 --> 45:21.448
Would someone please
take me back to my room?

45:28.690 --> 45:30.760
- My brothers and sisters.
- Yes!

45:30.970 --> 45:33.848
I want to give your soul a wake-up call!

45:34.050 --> 45:35.165
Yes!

45:35.370 --> 45:39.921
- I want to put Jesus... on the line.
- Yeah!

45:40.130 --> 45:43.202
- Don't hang up on him now.
- No!

45:43.410 --> 45:46.482
No. Pick up that phone
and say, "Hello."

45:46.690 --> 45:47.884
Hello!

45:48.090 --> 45:49.921
- Jesus!
- Yeah!

45:50.130 --> 45:54.248
He's listening.
Lord, I know he's listening.

45:54.450 --> 45:56.008
Yeah!

45:57.130 --> 45:59.246
- Can I get an amen?
- Amen!

45:59.450 --> 46:02.726
- Can I get an amen?
- Amen!

46:02.930 --> 46:06.127
We got the spirit tonight!

46:06.330 --> 46:08.764
Who is gonna witness for me?

46:08.970 --> 46:12.485
We got the Lord on the line!
Who is gonna take the call?

46:12.690 --> 46:14.840
Please don't leave God on hold!

46:16.050 --> 46:21.078
- You have called and I have answered!
- We have a witness!

46:32.010 --> 46:35.719
I came to tell you that I was once
a lover of the things of this world.

46:37.570 --> 46:39.526
I made $100,000 a year.

46:39.730 --> 46:43.120
I had a house in Scarsdale
with a big blue swimming pool!

46:44.770 --> 46:47.842
Yes, brothers,
I lived the white man's lie.

46:49.450 --> 46:54.888
But I was lost!
Yes, I was dancing with alcohol!

46:55.090 --> 46:57.285
I was loving drugs!

46:57.490 --> 46:59.720
- And there were women.
- Oh, yeah.

46:59.930 --> 47:04.287
Brothers and sisters,
oh, God, there were women.

47:04.490 --> 47:06.924
- Fine women!
- Yes!

47:07.130 --> 47:10.566
But I hadn't hit bottom yet. Oh, no.

47:10.770 --> 47:14.809
I just kept falling
right on through the floor.

47:15.010 --> 47:17.808
And that's when God found me.

47:20.770 --> 47:23.079
- You know what he said to me?
- What did he say?!

47:23.370 --> 47:26.840
And I've been persecuted
for speaking this truth.

47:27.050 --> 47:30.201
He said to me, "Son!"

47:30.410 --> 47:35.086
That's what he called me.
And I said, "Son?"

47:35.290 --> 47:39.602
And he said,
"Yes! Yes! You are the son of God!"

47:39.810 --> 47:42.802
That's blasphemy!

47:43.010 --> 47:45.365
I said, "What, Lord?"

47:45.570 --> 47:51.202
And he said, "It's time for you to leave
behind the things of this world."

47:51.410 --> 47:55.642
"The fine houses, the fancy cars,
the flashy clothes,

47:55.850 --> 48:00.082
because we are all naked
in the eyes of the Lord."

48:00.290 --> 48:02.008
Stop!

48:02.210 --> 48:05.202
This man is clinically insane!

48:05.410 --> 48:08.925
He is presently undergoing treatment
under my supervision!

48:13.010 --> 48:15.808
If I only saved one soul in there,
it was well worth it!

48:19.730 --> 48:24.042
So am I walking home with
an escaped mental patient or what?

48:24.250 --> 48:25.888
Nah, I got a weekend pass.

48:26.090 --> 48:28.479
I aced my Rorschach test.

48:28.690 --> 48:32.399
You got your shoes on.
You're not drooling.

48:32.610 --> 48:34.726
- I'm impressed.
- Thanks.

48:34.930 --> 48:39.048
- So you're still writing?
- I'm still making things up.

48:39.250 --> 48:44.005
I tell these guys my girlfriend's
an actress and we check out the soaps.

48:44.210 --> 48:47.998
Are you still acting?

48:49.650 --> 48:52.210
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm still acting.

48:52.410 --> 48:57.245
It's Linda in <i>A Skull For Sammy.</i> She
found her mother's head in the dryer.

48:57.450 --> 49:00.203
I read for it yesterday. Don't laugh.

49:00.410 --> 49:02.480
I'm not laughing.

49:02.690 --> 49:06.080
I think that's the same scream
your mother used when she met me.

49:06.290 --> 49:09.965
I'm red hot. I mean, six months ago,
I'm a nobody, right?

49:10.170 --> 49:13.606
Then my theatre group does this reading,
I meet this guy,

49:13.810 --> 49:17.644
he knows this agent
and it's inside-track time.

49:17.850 --> 49:19.920
I've been going up on commercials.

49:20.130 --> 49:22.849
I haven't been in one yet,
but my hand has.

49:23.050 --> 49:25.006
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

49:26.090 --> 49:28.650
I'm not gonna waitress forever, am I?

49:28.850 --> 49:32.843
No! You're great.
I've always told you you were great.

49:33.050 --> 49:35.723
Yeah. You did.

49:37.450 --> 49:40.248
- But then they locked you up.
- Yeah.

49:41.570 --> 49:43.561
So we pick up this kid.
It's 3:00am.

49:43.770 --> 49:48.002
He's walking down Fifth Avenue
with a brand-new, 21-inch colour TV.

49:48.210 --> 49:52.681
I asked him where he got it.
"Some dude. I never saw him before."

49:52.890 --> 49:57.725
"And this dude gave you a brand-new
colour TV in the middle of the night?"

49:57.930 --> 50:02.242
"Yes, that's right. I thought it was
pretty strange myself at the time."

50:04.370 --> 50:08.966
This is what's known in legal circles
as the "Mysterious Dude" defence.

50:14.090 --> 50:16.160
That story just keeps getting funnier.

50:16.370 --> 50:19.840
I remember when you first started
telling it. Right after the war.

50:20.050 --> 50:24.043
You know what I find fascinating?
Male vanity.

50:24.250 --> 50:28.323
You accept it in a peacock, but it's
harder to take from a putz like you.

50:29.610 --> 50:33.569
I gotta listen to this from a guy who
orders his pants through the mail?

50:33.770 --> 50:35.601
Did you guys log out with Alvarez?

50:35.810 --> 50:39.166
- Yeah, this morning.
- His wife's been calling.

50:39.370 --> 50:41.406
If you see him.

51:09.410 --> 51:13.961
Bingo. Very thorough.
Names, dates, dollar figures.

51:14.170 --> 51:16.843
For every sucker we ever shook down?

51:17.050 --> 51:20.201
This officially concludes
Mr Alvarez's investigation.

51:21.850 --> 51:23.522
We're looking good.

51:23.730 --> 51:26.164
We've got a dead cop
and we've got a witness.

51:26.370 --> 51:29.760
- Ergo we are not looking good.
- Speak English, asshole.

51:31.890 --> 51:34.529
A dead man is not a witness.

51:34.730 --> 51:37.449
It doesn't look bigger,
it just looks nicer.

51:38.570 --> 51:40.049
It does.

51:40.250 --> 51:43.560
- I'm home.
- This is where you live?

51:43.770 --> 51:46.284
- Yeah.
- Wow.

51:48.530 --> 51:52.842
Boy. Sane people get all the breaks.

51:54.810 --> 51:57.802
Look, I can't invite you up.

51:58.010 --> 52:01.844
Sure you can. You just say,
"Hey, Bill, you wanna come up?"

52:02.050 --> 52:05.201
No. This is my friend's place.

52:09.890 --> 52:12.723
Is this friend a guy?

52:12.930 --> 52:15.205
Yeah.

52:15.410 --> 52:17.640
Right.

52:20.770 --> 52:24.206
Look, Bill,
he's got a job and he pays his bills.

52:24.410 --> 52:27.925
I never had to bail him out of jail.
You know.

52:31.610 --> 52:34.727
A woman sometimes
finds that attractive in a man.

52:35.770 --> 52:36.885
Sounds dull.

52:37.090 --> 52:40.287
His name is Ed
and I told you all about him.

52:40.490 --> 52:43.209
You told me you were dating him.
This is serious.

52:43.410 --> 52:47.961
You've been gone for a year and a half.
How long did you expect me to wait?

52:48.170 --> 52:51.719
You want the truth?
There is no weekend pass.

52:54.130 --> 52:56.564
This doctor brings us in
to see a Yankee game

52:56.770 --> 52:58.601
then he disappeared on 48th Street.

52:58.810 --> 53:02.769
He took numbnuts down an alley
to take a pee and never came back.

53:04.570 --> 53:07.846
- So where are these other um...
- Nuts?

53:08.050 --> 53:10.280
- Right.
- I don't know.

53:10.490 --> 53:13.926
You gotta see these guys.
They're a couple of beauties.

53:14.130 --> 53:18.442
One guy barely speaks, one thinks he's
Jesus and the other is the craziest.

53:18.650 --> 53:21.562
- Reminds me of your brother Lenny.
- Oh, boy.

53:23.130 --> 53:26.964
- What's gonna happen to them?
- How the hell should I know?

53:27.170 --> 53:30.128
They're just a bunch of screwballs
from my group.

53:30.330 --> 53:32.890
- Group therapy?
- No, my fencing group.

53:33.090 --> 53:35.650
- Yeah, group therapy.
- Wait a minute.

53:35.850 --> 53:40.560
You and these guys share the most
intimate secrets of your lives,

53:40.770 --> 53:44.285
and then when there's a problem,
you just walk away and leave them?

53:47.850 --> 53:51.604
Fine. I'm totally irresponsible, right?

53:51.810 --> 53:53.766
OK? You satisfied?

53:54.930 --> 53:58.718
I see you haven't changed much.
You almost knocked that plant over.

54:01.570 --> 54:04.642
I can't believe you.

54:04.850 --> 54:08.081
- Have a nice life.
- Thanks, I will.

54:13.490 --> 54:15.560
Whoa!

54:17.690 --> 54:22.559
Stop! Who dares to tow the van
of the living Christ?

54:22.770 --> 54:25.079
The City of New York, Tarzan.

54:26.490 --> 54:30.324
50 for the violation, 75 for the tow

54:30.530 --> 54:32.600
and 20 bucks a day for storage.

54:32.810 --> 54:35.688
Thank you, officer.
I won't let you down.

54:35.890 --> 54:38.358
Father, forgive us, for we have sinned.

54:38.570 --> 54:41.084
We parked our car in a forbidden zone.

54:48.170 --> 54:50.161
Where the hell's Albert?

54:57.130 --> 55:00.122
- There's a guy back there.
- Bullshit.

55:02.210 --> 55:04.360
Jack, come here.

55:04.570 --> 55:07.243
Hey. You wanna move Beauregard here?

55:10.130 --> 55:13.042
Come on, Albert. You OK?

55:13.250 --> 55:17.687
- I mean, as OK as you get.
- Close call at second.

55:35.450 --> 55:38.044
Well, we just caught a major break.

55:38.250 --> 55:43.802
We could be back in the ward staring
at the walls right now, but we're not.

55:44.010 --> 55:48.561
Instead, what have we got, fellas?
We got a night on the town.

55:51.770 --> 55:54.842
This is God's way of telling us
we're going to die.

55:59.090 --> 56:01.285
They were due back at 11:30.

56:01.490 --> 56:04.562
- It's almost 1:00!
- I was against this thing.

56:04.770 --> 56:08.445
- Traffic? A flat tyre? Who knows?
- He should have phoned.

56:08.650 --> 56:12.006
I'll see if there have been
any accidents.

56:12.210 --> 56:15.839
Jeff's a responsible guy.
I'm sure everything is under control.

56:18.650 --> 56:22.962
- We should review our goals.
- We've got to find the doctor.

56:23.170 --> 56:25.479
Who put you in charge?
I'm in charge here!

56:25.690 --> 56:28.841
Read the New Testament.
You'll find out who's in charge.

56:29.050 --> 56:30.403
Get out of our way!

56:30.610 --> 56:34.125
Albert, you step on my foot again,
I'm gonna kill you.

56:34.330 --> 56:38.448
Why does a grown man
have to smell like tuna fish?

56:41.210 --> 56:43.770
- Is it left?
- Straight.

56:45.410 --> 56:49.119
Right. Now easy, easy.
Up, easy. Watch it.

56:49.330 --> 56:51.605
- Watch it.
- All yours, Bernie.

56:59.330 --> 57:01.605
How're you doin'?

57:03.530 --> 57:05.964
We want something casual
for the son of God.

57:06.170 --> 57:09.128
How much does
the Supreme Being want to spend?

57:09.330 --> 57:12.766
How about a nice Harris tweed
with a blue Oxford button-down

57:12.970 --> 57:15.404
and maybe a nice Countess Mara tie,
hey, sport?

57:15.610 --> 57:18.727
Why don't you guys go out
and browse around for a while?

57:22.170 --> 57:24.126
Browse!

57:27.770 --> 57:31.809
This is the nicest
Army and Navy store I've ever been in

57:32.010 --> 57:35.320
and I've been in every branch
of the services, so I know.

57:35.530 --> 57:38.044
Your friends look like
they've seen action too.

57:38.250 --> 57:41.048
- OK, you've noticed they're different.
- I've noticed.

57:41.250 --> 57:43.764
You want to know why?

57:43.970 --> 57:46.803
We're a special combat unit
with the US Marine Corps.

57:47.010 --> 57:48.966
We're tracking Libyan terrorists.

57:49.170 --> 57:52.845
We've got them trailed
to a bagel shop around the corner.

57:53.050 --> 57:56.759
- We need some pants for the colonel.
- Give me a break.

57:57.890 --> 58:01.485
- OK, we're four escaped lunatics.
- This I believe.

58:01.690 --> 58:04.921
You've got the large in here
with the extra large.

58:05.130 --> 58:06.961
I'm afraid to get into
the sock bin.

58:07.170 --> 58:09.525
Now, what do you want?

58:09.730 --> 58:12.881
You probably want us out of here
as quickly as possible, right?

58:13.090 --> 58:14.967
I'm prepared to carry you in my arms.

58:15.170 --> 58:17.525
Then stretch that clothing dollar.

58:17.730 --> 58:20.608
What kind of stretch
are we talking about?

58:20.810 --> 58:23.165
Twelve bucks.

58:28.290 --> 58:31.600
I'm telling you, it works.
It's a statement, man.

58:31.810 --> 58:34.165
You know who you are.

58:34.370 --> 58:36.486
No, he doesn't.

58:36.690 --> 58:39.204
Anything else
I can help you fellas with?

58:39.410 --> 58:43.926
Can you recommend a good clinical
psychiatrist? We've lost ours.

58:44.130 --> 58:49.045
We don't have one on staff,
but I do know a guy you could talk to.

58:49.250 --> 58:53.482
Now, this missing doctor.
We're all sure he really exists, right?

58:53.690 --> 58:57.842
Take a look at this guy.
Can you imagine him without a doctor?

58:58.050 --> 59:02.726
- OK. Just checking. Do you mind?
- Swing and a miss.

59:02.930 --> 59:07.367
Just give us as much attention as you
would one of your French fries, OK?

59:07.570 --> 59:11.358
- This guy's been gone for hours.
- A few hours is not a missing person.

59:11.570 --> 59:14.289
It's a guy that went to the movies.
Met a lady.

59:15.850 --> 59:19.445
A doctor doesn't leave four mental
patients to go cruise for chicks.

59:19.650 --> 59:24.246
Doctors can be strange characters.
One wiped out his whole family.

59:24.450 --> 59:28.159
- Dr Weitzman doesn't have any family.
- What did I tell you?

59:28.370 --> 59:31.282
- Oh, man.
- Hey, I'm kidding.

59:31.490 --> 59:33.845
Why don't you call your hospital?

59:34.050 --> 59:39.044
Because the doc would lose his job
and they'll have us back on medication.

59:40.090 --> 59:44.003
You've got this whole thing backwards.
You're the missing persons.

59:44.210 --> 59:48.044
Go back to 48th Street. If the guy
doesn't show, we're open 24 hours.

59:48.250 --> 59:50.844
- You don't understand.
- Vincente.

59:51.050 --> 59:53.564
- We're not done.
- It's been a pleasure.

59:53.770 --> 59:56.842
- We used to be taxpayers.
- Now that will get my attention.

59:57.050 --> 59:59.325
Get out or you got a night in jail.

59:59.530 --> 01:00:04.206
What kind of cop would send four mental
patients back out in the streets?

01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:12.526
It's not his fault.
He's not as competent as we are.

01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:18.690
Another episode
and you'll be out of the group.

01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:21.199
- Can I have that in writing?
- Wait a minute.

01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:24.129
I'm not going until
somebody gets me my dinner.

01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:26.924
Dinner? I've got to get
this report to Dr Newald.

01:00:27.130 --> 01:00:30.884
- Which way is Trenton?
- Straight ahead. 71 miles.

01:00:31.090 --> 01:00:34.639
If you don't stop for the litter
you could be back by Christmas.

01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:38.206
Exit 11, Henry! Pace yourself!

01:00:39.490 --> 01:00:41.446
Albert!

01:00:43.770 --> 01:00:47.285
- Do we have to put you on a leash?
- How do you get him to talk?

01:00:47.490 --> 01:00:51.802
- I don't advise over-stimulating him.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:55.889
- Is this to do with Weitzman?
- Did they take him in an ambulance?

01:00:58.130 --> 01:01:02.362
It's like a scene out of <i>Lassie.</i>
"Did he fall in the well, Lassie?"

01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:06.006
Did they take Weitzman away
in an ambulance?

01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:10.883
- Big inning.
- That's a definite yes.

01:01:11.090 --> 01:01:13.524
- He just said, "Big inning."
- But he nodded.

01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:18.406
- Big inning.
- See? You just need to speak Albert.

01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:21.522
No, Weitzman with a Z. Right.

01:01:21.730 --> 01:01:25.040
No, huh? Look, nurse. What's your name?

01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:27.286
Helen Grabosky? Hey.

01:01:27.490 --> 01:01:31.278
This is Billy Caufield. You treated me
for a scalp wound a couple of years ago.

01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:34.527
Yeah. Self-inflicted. Right.

01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:39.850
Well, it was a bet, you know. Yeah.
No, it healed up great.

01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:43.122
Look, do you have
any John Does over there?

01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:46.208
Really? OK, no. That's OK. Thanks.

01:01:53.090 --> 01:01:57.242
Not one hospital's got the doc.
Just a couple of John Does.

01:01:58.730 --> 01:02:02.245
Not John Doe. Dr Weitzman.
I'd better handle this.

01:02:05.130 --> 01:02:07.086
Look, Dr Freud,

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:10.566
if a guy checks into a hospital
and he's unconscious,

01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:13.045
they call him John Doe, all right?

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:16.322
We'll have to check
the hospitals ourselves.

01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:18.919
That's public property.

01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:24.409
Watch this. Public property.

01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:34.401
Private property.

01:02:35.290 --> 01:02:37.246
Vandal.

01:02:37.450 --> 01:02:40.248
- Do you all have to go in?
- Yes. We're the Doe brothers.

01:02:40.450 --> 01:02:43.886
Harriet, Dr Epson wants
Mrs Freeman's chart, OK?

01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:46.923
Your John Doe's in 409.
I'll be with you in a minute.

01:02:50.290 --> 01:02:53.965
Dear Lord, we humbly ask your mercy
for our dear departed.

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:56.081
You got it.

01:02:58.970 --> 01:03:03.282
We are never prepared for a death,
especially of one so loved.

01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:06.926
But let us find comfort
in knowing that he is at peace.

01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:10.247
Father, may I say a few words?

01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:16.481
I knew this man perhaps
better than anyone here.

01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:20.239
I pledge to continue his work
as long as I live.

01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:25.126
- Thought we were selling the car wash.
- He devoted his life to the insane.

01:03:25.330 --> 01:03:28.163
Uncle Phil? Did Martha know about this?

01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:36.762
- Henry, may I say a few words?
- Certainly, William.

01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:42.368
It's not him.

01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:46.279
Perhaps I'd better
bring my remarks to a close.

01:03:50.690 --> 01:03:54.160
I never knew there were
so many John Does in this world.

01:03:54.370 --> 01:03:56.440
It's hopeless.

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:04.439
Room 555? Thank you.

01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:33.599
Room 555.
For a John Doe, he's awfully popular.

01:04:33.810 --> 01:04:37.007
Pitcher's in trouble.
Pitcher's in trouble!

01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:47.685
What? What is it? What?

01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:50.726
Weitzman? Is it Weitzman?

01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:52.966
Come on.

01:05:15.490 --> 01:05:18.323
- Room 555?
- Just down the hall.

01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:32.160
The room's closed. Get lost.

01:05:32.370 --> 01:05:34.930
We already are lost. Thanks anyway.

01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:38.725
I said no one in that room.
Hospital security.

01:05:38.930 --> 01:05:41.524
You could lose a lot of privileges
for this.

01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:44.881
- I'll use this.
- I have died and been reborn.

01:05:45.090 --> 01:05:47.684
I can do it again, buster.

01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:51.678
- Are you guys crazy?
- Totally.

01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:57.287
What the hell are you doing?

01:05:59.130 --> 01:06:02.088
Holy shit. What is...

01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:06.478
Here, put this in.
Call a nurse or something.

01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:17.889
What the hell is going on?
Get out of my way.

01:06:18.090 --> 01:06:19.842
Is he gonna be all right?

01:06:23.090 --> 01:06:25.320
Call security.
Have these men arrested.

01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:29.489
- We didn't do anything.
- I'll have a full report!

01:06:39.570 --> 01:06:41.367
Stairs! Stairs! Come on!

01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:54.966
Stop those guys!

01:06:55.170 --> 01:06:57.161
They just tried to kill somebody.

01:06:57.370 --> 01:07:00.840
What are you talking about?
They're cops.

01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:02.768
They're what?

01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:07.043
- For you on three. It's them.
- Weitzman?

01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:09.127
No, them!

01:07:11.290 --> 01:07:13.679
Dr Newald, it's...

01:07:15.450 --> 01:07:18.089
- It's Billy Caufield. How are you?
- I'm fine.

01:07:18.290 --> 01:07:21.760
<i>- Good. Listen, do I sound calm to you?</i>
- Yes.

01:07:21.970 --> 01:07:24.928
Good. I'm really trying
to sound calm because...

01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:29.089
We ran into a little snag.
Somebody's trying to kill Dr Weitzman.

01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:31.281
Caufield lives in a fantasy world.

01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:34.084
He also has a real history of violence.

01:07:34.290 --> 01:07:36.246
Where are you calling from?

01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:38.805
A phone booth
on the corner of 61st and Park.

01:07:39.090 --> 01:07:41.081
Call the New York City police.

01:07:42.330 --> 01:07:45.481
Billy, where's Dr Weitzman now?

01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:48.409
In Mercy Hospital
but someone's trying to kill him.

01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:50.248
The Prince of Darkness!

01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:54.238
Jack McDermott.
Christ fixation. Megalomania.

01:07:54.450 --> 01:07:58.159
- Where was I?
- William, find a policeman...

01:07:58.370 --> 01:08:01.009
No! The police are in on this.

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:04.247
- In on what?
- It's Satan's plot!

01:08:04.450 --> 01:08:06.964
I'm trying to handle this,
you jerk-off. Shut up.

01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:10.321
Dr Newald, this is Henry Sikorsky,
Dr Weitzman's assistant.

01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:13.283
<i>- Tell these patients I'm in charge.</i>
- Assistant?

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:16.926
- Paranoid schizophrenic.
<i>- Keep away from the phone!</i>

01:08:17.130 --> 01:08:19.689
You're out of here.

01:08:19.890 --> 01:08:22.529
Look, Dr Newald, as I was saying.

01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:25.005
It's not a good idea to call the police.

01:08:25.210 --> 01:08:28.885
No, William. We won't call the police
if that makes you uncomfortable.

01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:30.966
It makes me really uncomfortable.

01:08:31.170 --> 01:08:34.719
<i>You just stay right where you are.</i>
<i>Everything is gonna be fine.</i>

01:08:34.930 --> 01:08:38.639
Say, I hear we're having
chicken chow mein tonight.

01:08:38.850 --> 01:08:43.162
That's one of my favourites.
Is that one of your favourites, William?

01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:52.167
A cop car just pulled alongside me
on the sidewalk!

01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:54.837
- Let's go. Move it.
- Honey! Honey!

01:08:55.050 --> 01:08:58.326
- Up against the wall. Let's go.
- Call my lawyer!

01:08:58.529 --> 01:09:00.122
Spread your legs. Let's go.

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:10.200
Hey! Plop, plop, fizz, fizz,
oh what a relief it is!

01:09:12.370 --> 01:09:14.406
Jack, it's me, Tom!

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:17.363
Right! Tom! Tom Canning!

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:21.358
I didn't know you were in town.
You coming back into the ad game?

01:09:21.569 --> 01:09:24.562
No immediate plans.
I'm wanted by the police right now.

01:09:24.770 --> 01:09:26.965
Bummer. Hassle with the IRS?

01:09:27.170 --> 01:09:29.843
- Attempted murder, Tom.
- That's not fun.

01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:34.407
- This guy. He never stops. Come on.
- These gentlemen are involved.

01:09:34.609 --> 01:09:38.125
Jack and I killed a few account people
in our day, too, didn't we?

01:09:38.330 --> 01:09:41.606
They tried to smother him.
His tubes got all pulled out.

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:45.928
Well, I got a 10:00 at Bristol.
Nice meeting you all.

01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:50.089
- We gotta do lunch, Jack.
- OK, fella. Give you a holler.

01:09:50.290 --> 01:09:53.600
- Let's get out of here.
- We should review our goals.

01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:58.083
Our goals? Look at this.

01:09:58.290 --> 01:10:01.999
We've gotta come up with 165 big ones.
We've gotta get the van.

01:10:02.210 --> 01:10:05.646
We've gotta get Weitzman
before those cops come back.

01:10:05.850 --> 01:10:07.806
How's that for a goal?

01:10:08.010 --> 01:10:10.524
You mean us? But we're crazy.

01:10:10.730 --> 01:10:15.520
Yeah. But we'd better get sane
real goddamn fast.

01:10:15.730 --> 01:10:18.244
Could we see that first group
of pictures again?

01:10:18.450 --> 01:10:22.568
Give me a break. Was this guy
in your store or on the goddamn moon?

01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:27.809
It appears we have
Mr and Mrs Helen Keller in here.

01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:33.368
- I'm gonna lock them up.
- Macguire. Gianelli. In here.

01:10:41.530 --> 01:10:46.684
They found Alvarez's body in a warehouse
on 47th with two .38 slugs in his head.

01:10:46.890 --> 01:10:48.448
Jesus Christ.

01:10:48.650 --> 01:10:51.289
It was the same alleyway
they found that shrink.

01:10:51.490 --> 01:10:53.526
He's still unconscious at Mercy Hospital

01:10:53.730 --> 01:10:56.927
and those four nuts who attacked him
are still rattling around.

01:10:57.130 --> 01:11:00.884
- They must have done Alvarez too.
- It's the only thing we got right now.

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:04.321
- There's an APB out on 'em.
- You got security on the room?

01:11:04.530 --> 01:11:08.205
Yeah. When this guy comes out of it,
he could put everything together.

01:11:11.690 --> 01:11:15.365
I have a feeling those psychos are
about to go after their doctor again.

01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:19.839
Hey. Watch it.

01:11:20.050 --> 01:11:23.247
Right. Go. Go. Come on.

01:11:38.490 --> 01:11:40.640
Billy. Tell me this is a bad dream.

01:11:42.290 --> 01:11:44.724
Actually, it's four bad dreams.

01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:47.888
Riley, this is Henry,
this is Jack and this is Albert.

01:11:48.090 --> 01:11:50.320
Billy, Ed is home.

01:11:50.530 --> 01:11:52.361
Really? Where?

01:11:52.570 --> 01:11:55.642
Look, Riles,
I got a real situation here.

01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:58.205
This report should answer any questions.

01:11:58.410 --> 01:12:00.924
- This better be good.
- OK. Come on.

01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:03.405
Come on, come on, come on.

01:12:04.810 --> 01:12:06.766
No breakage.

01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:15.487
Great. Breakfast. I'm starved.

01:12:15.690 --> 01:12:17.999
That's not ours. That's Ed's.

01:12:18.210 --> 01:12:21.520
Did Ed make the sun shine?
Did Ed make the wheat grow?

01:12:21.730 --> 01:12:23.846
I don't know the man.

01:12:29.370 --> 01:12:31.326
Good morning.

01:12:32.730 --> 01:12:37.121
- Hi, Ed.
- Hi. You friends of Riley?

01:12:37.330 --> 01:12:40.288
I'm a friend to all men.
We've come for your money, Ed.

01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:46.400
This is the breakdown, Ed.
50 for the fine, 75 for the tow.

01:12:48.690 --> 01:12:51.523
Wait a minute. Don't tell me.

01:12:51.730 --> 01:12:55.405
You guys must be
Riley's theatre group, right?

01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:58.124
Yes. This is our group, Ed.

01:12:58.330 --> 01:13:00.207
You guys had me going for a minute.

01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:03.527
You stand-up guys are something else.

01:13:03.730 --> 01:13:06.847
- Does Ed know I'm nuts?
- Let's not get into that.

01:13:08.770 --> 01:13:10.726
Ed. Hi.

01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:15.809
I see that you've met
Albert and Henry and Jack.

01:13:17.010 --> 01:13:19.888
- I'd like you to meet my friend Billy.
- Hi, Ed.

01:13:20.090 --> 01:13:22.399
Hey, Bill. What do you do?

01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:24.487
What do I do?

01:13:26.410 --> 01:13:29.720
Well, it kind of depends
on the circumstances, Ed.

01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:31.807
Oh, yeah?

01:13:32.010 --> 01:13:35.207
- You got some real nice things here.
- Oh, thanks.

01:13:35.410 --> 01:13:39.562
That's <i>Molten Venus.</i>
Do you know Loucka?

01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:43.365
You can't touch one of his nudes
for less than six figures these days.

01:13:43.570 --> 01:13:45.128
I believe you, Ed.

01:13:45.330 --> 01:13:48.163
This is a brilliant manipulation
of negative space.

01:13:48.370 --> 01:13:52.249
Post-modernist, neo-cubist.
Breathtaking.

01:13:52.450 --> 01:13:54.406
You really know your Loucka.

01:13:54.610 --> 01:13:58.046
You know why it's a brilliant
manipulation of negative space?

01:13:58.250 --> 01:14:03.278
- No. Why?
- Because Jesus wants it that way.

01:14:06.330 --> 01:14:10.039
You guys! You're always on,
aren't you? Right?

01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:14.926
- You comedy guys!
- Could I talk to you just for a minute?

01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:18.247
- Yeah, sure.
- Hey, there's Dr Newald.

01:14:18.450 --> 01:14:21.886
<i> Are these men dangerous?</i>
<i>Should the public be concerned?</i>

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:24.524
<i>On the basis of</i>
<i>two attacks on the doctor,</i>

01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:27.164
<i>I'm afraid I would have to say</i>
<i>yes, they are.</i>

01:14:27.370 --> 01:14:28.883
<i>Is this unusual?</i>

01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:31.365
<i>It is an irony that the therapist</i>

01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:35.040
<i>sometimes becomes the focus</i>
<i>for hostilities and transference.</i>

01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:37.844
<i>- Thank you.</i>
- The man's a giant in the field.

01:14:38.050 --> 01:14:40.803
<i>... for the</i> Morning Report.
<i>- Thank you, Donna.</i>

01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:45.447
<i>We have photographs of the patients</i>
<i>wanted in the attack on the doctor</i>

01:14:45.650 --> 01:14:49.086
<i>and for questioning in the murder</i>
<i>of a New York City police officer.</i>

01:14:49.290 --> 01:14:51.645
<i>The patients are William Caufield,</i>

01:14:51.850 --> 01:14:57.322
<i>Henry Sikorsky, Albert Ianuzzi</i>
<i>and Jack McDermott.</i>

01:14:57.530 --> 01:15:00.124
<i>- In local sports...</i>
- Who are you calling, Ed?

01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:03.402
911. Yeah, this is Ed Nivens.

01:15:03.610 --> 01:15:05.999
Yes, it's an emergency.
151 Central Park West.

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:08.804
Ed, could you let them...

01:15:09.010 --> 01:15:11.570
Does Ed go out the window?
Let's have a show of hands.

01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:15.240
- You can vote, too. This is America.
- You'll lose your privileges!

01:15:15.450 --> 01:15:18.760
You think they're going to let you out?

01:15:18.970 --> 01:15:21.325
Boy, I hope you appreciate
this woman, Ed.

01:15:23.130 --> 01:15:25.439
Come on. Come on.

01:15:39.290 --> 01:15:41.246
Come on!

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:50.563
Don't let them leave the building!
It's your job!

01:15:55.930 --> 01:15:58.842
Your attention, gentleman.
My name is Caesar.

01:15:59.050 --> 01:16:02.929
Mr Nivens asked me to stop you.
I must request you not move.

01:16:03.130 --> 01:16:05.690
Put that away.
You hold it like a goddamn doorman.

01:16:05.890 --> 01:16:08.324
I am the doorman.

01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:10.486
Then get us a cab.

01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:25.406
Holy cow.

01:16:34.170 --> 01:16:37.799
- Hold it right there!
- Freeze!

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:40.808
Put your hands behind your back!

01:16:44.130 --> 01:16:47.088
- Move it.
- Let him go!

01:16:49.970 --> 01:16:52.245
Hold it right there.

01:16:53.850 --> 01:16:56.967
Both of 'em. Let's go.

01:16:57.170 --> 01:16:59.365
Come on.

01:16:59.570 --> 01:17:02.482
Let's go. Let's go, I said! Move it!

01:17:04.490 --> 01:17:06.481
Come on.

01:17:06.690 --> 01:17:08.806
Billy!

01:17:09.010 --> 01:17:11.126
Stay right there.

01:17:11.730 --> 01:17:13.322
Turn to your right.

01:17:13.690 --> 01:17:15.248
Hold it.

01:17:15.850 --> 01:17:20.321
Face front. Chin up a bit.
Good. Good. Hold it.

01:17:22.050 --> 01:17:26.362
Look, I don't think I'm Elvis.
I don't talk to my dog.

01:17:26.570 --> 01:17:30.324
I never put on a dress and dance
around Time Square. None of that.

01:17:30.530 --> 01:17:32.600
Impressive credentials.

01:17:32.810 --> 01:17:36.439
Just believe me. There's two cops
and they could go back at any time.

01:17:36.650 --> 01:17:40.438
- It's a conspiracy.
- With the ghost of Lee Harvey Oswald?

01:17:47.050 --> 01:17:51.487
I lied. One time I did put on a dress
and have a dance around Time Square.

01:17:51.690 --> 01:17:54.284
But I was with Elvis
and my dog told me to do it,

01:17:54.490 --> 01:17:57.323
so you can't really blame me for that.

01:18:16.290 --> 01:18:19.566
- Your lunch date is here.
- Lunch date? It's 3:00.

01:18:19.770 --> 01:18:21.408
I don't think he cares.

01:18:22.330 --> 01:18:26.721
Memory lane, huh, Jack?
Nobody ever wrote copy like you did.

01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:30.559
The James Joyce of Chef Boyardee.
Remember that?

01:18:32.090 --> 01:18:34.046
Look, I'm desperate, Tom.

01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:37.083
I need money. The Lord sent me.

01:18:37.290 --> 01:18:41.681
I know last time I tried to throw
Murray and his Clios out the window.

01:18:41.890 --> 01:18:43.926
Let's be thankful Murray didn't fit.

01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:46.086
I think I came a long way, Tom.

01:18:46.290 --> 01:18:48.565
There's a doctor down there
who believes in me.

01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:51.523
We're talking about
giving Jesus his walking papers.

01:18:51.730 --> 01:18:54.119
But we've run into one complication.

01:18:56.370 --> 01:19:00.488
Murder.
I'm talking about murder, Tom.

01:19:00.690 --> 01:19:04.285
Someone is trying to kill my doctor.

01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:07.129
Hm, that is a problem.

01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:10.438
Murray. Look who I found.

01:19:10.650 --> 01:19:13.483
- Long time no see.
- Hi, Murray.

01:19:13.690 --> 01:19:16.409
We were just reminiscing.

01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:20.842
Tom, have you heard from Mitachi? We're
ready to commit hari-kari out here.

01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:23.200
- As soon as I hear, Murray.
- Right.

01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:30.286
Murray looks like he's under pressure.

01:19:30.490 --> 01:19:34.403
Well, let's say $30 million piece
of old Nippon, Jack.

01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:37.329
We're sweating out the call
from John Benson right now.

01:19:37.530 --> 01:19:39.885
Benson?
I used to think he was the devil.

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:44.082
Now I know he's just another bozo
trying to do business.

01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:48.920
Well, things haven't changed much
around here, Jack.

01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:51.166
That's him.

01:19:52.930 --> 01:19:55.364
Sorry, Jack.

01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:13.882
- Murray, congratulations.
- What are you talking about?

01:20:14.090 --> 01:20:17.321
Benson called.
You got the Mitachi account.

01:20:17.530 --> 01:20:20.169
- The Mitachi account!
- We got it?

01:20:20.370 --> 01:20:22.725
- Yeah.
- Really? We got it!

01:20:24.050 --> 01:20:28.202
We got Mitachi! We got Mitachi!

01:20:28.410 --> 01:20:30.446
- Murray.
- Yeah.

01:20:30.650 --> 01:20:32.606
Just kidding.

01:20:32.810 --> 01:20:35.370
Wah-wah-wah-wah.

01:21:17.610 --> 01:21:19.601
Who is it, dear?

01:21:26.490 --> 01:21:30.608
They called this afternoon. I told them
I hadn't heard from you in two years.

01:21:30.810 --> 01:21:34.439
Why didn't you answer my letters?

01:21:34.650 --> 01:21:37.847
I thought I lost you.
I was afraid to find out.

01:21:44.290 --> 01:21:46.360
They arrested those other patients.

01:21:46.570 --> 01:21:51.405
It's up to me now. I've got to get
the guys and the doctor out of there.

01:21:52.810 --> 01:21:55.244
I need some money.

01:21:56.770 --> 01:21:59.409
I know it sounds crazy.

01:22:04.810 --> 01:22:06.801
I believe you.

01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:11.208
I don't know why.
It's maybe because I want to so much.

01:22:24.370 --> 01:22:27.328
It's $170. It's all I have in the house.

01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:29.885
This means a lot.

01:22:32.730 --> 01:22:35.528
Do you really have to go?

01:22:35.730 --> 01:22:39.848
They laugh at me all the time,
but I know they need me now.

01:22:40.050 --> 01:22:43.645
Miss Ferguson gives you a star
when you colour it the right colour.

01:22:43.850 --> 01:22:47.684
Parrots are green
and canaries are yellow.

01:22:49.810 --> 01:22:52.404
Can I have that for my pictures?

01:23:12.410 --> 01:23:14.480
Thanks.

01:23:16.170 --> 01:23:18.365
You're very welcome.

01:23:22.530 --> 01:23:24.521
Daddy?

01:23:26.330 --> 01:23:30.243
When are you coming home
to live with us some more?

01:23:30.450 --> 01:23:32.884
Do you want me to?

01:23:33.090 --> 01:23:35.206
When you're ready.

01:23:51.010 --> 01:23:53.444
I hope they're ready to leave.

01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:55.606
I'm sure they are.

01:23:58.330 --> 01:24:01.288
- Your patients, Doctor.
- We'll just be a minute.

01:24:04.490 --> 01:24:07.243
- Is something wrong?
- Everything's fine, Doctor.

01:24:13.650 --> 01:24:15.606
Nice going, Doc.

01:24:15.810 --> 01:24:19.644
<i>Opposition leaders have threatened</i>
<i>continued violence and strikes,</i>

01:24:19.850 --> 01:24:21.806
<i>demanding new elections.</i>

01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:25.719
<i>In local news, the last of the patients</i>
<i>missing from Cedarbrook Hospital</i>

01:24:25.930 --> 01:24:28.000
<i>surrendered to police this afternoon.</i>

01:24:28.210 --> 01:24:32.761
<i>The four are believed to be responsible</i>
<i>for the attack on their doctor,</i>

01:24:32.970 --> 01:24:36.201
<i>and may be involved in the murder</i>
<i>of a New York police officer.</i>

01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:39.129
<i>The men have just been arraigned</i>
<i>at 100 Centre Street,</i>

01:24:39.330 --> 01:24:43.881
<i>where they entered pleas of not guilty</i>
<i>to assault and attempted murder.</i>

01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:47.287
Well, I guess that's the last
of the James Gang.

01:24:47.490 --> 01:24:50.084
Ed, leave it on.

01:24:51.930 --> 01:24:56.401
<i>... bizarre series of events.</i>
- Forget him, Riley. The guy's insane.

01:24:56.610 --> 01:24:59.602
At least he's not a schmuck.

01:24:59.810 --> 01:25:03.200
- Just one?
- You'll have to wait for my report.

01:25:03.410 --> 01:25:05.241
Let's go to the video tape.

01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:07.725
I shall rise again in three days.
Count on it.

01:25:07.930 --> 01:25:11.923
We came to town to see a ball game,
now they want to give us the chair.

01:25:12.130 --> 01:25:16.248
I love New York. Bring your kids.
Do some time in the Big Apple.

01:25:16.450 --> 01:25:19.726
- Our man is off the room.
- Great.

01:25:19.930 --> 01:25:23.081
The bad news is
the patient's starting to come around.

01:25:23.290 --> 01:25:25.406
We better get there quick.

01:25:26.690 --> 01:25:29.966
What kind of moron takes four mental
patients to a baseball game?

01:25:30.170 --> 01:25:33.924
Ceramics. That's more our speed.

01:25:34.130 --> 01:25:38.328
Making little ashtrays
with our fucking names on.

01:25:38.530 --> 01:25:40.919
We're the drool patrol.

01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:44.639
Are you gonna replace that mattress?

01:25:54.930 --> 01:25:58.206
I think we do your lobotomy
here and now. Scrub up, Albert.

01:25:58.410 --> 01:26:00.321
That does it. Electroshock.

01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:03.203
You'll be whistling
a different tune at 240 volts.

01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:09.642
You're not a doctor! You don't have the
medical background to squeeze a pimple!

01:26:09.850 --> 01:26:12.318
You ought to be cast into
the outer darkness.

01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:15.522
The rec hall will look pretty good
from the bowels of hell.

01:26:15.730 --> 01:26:18.085
Listen to me, you nut ball.
I got big news for you.

01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:21.168
You'll be the first supreme being
to make a license plate.

01:26:21.370 --> 01:26:23.326
Working with metal, next on <i>Mr. Fix-It.</i>

01:26:23.530 --> 01:26:26.761
And you, you're nothing.
You're not anything.

01:26:26.970 --> 01:26:30.201
You know what's going on, don't you?
You know.

01:26:30.410 --> 01:26:32.640
He probably speaks seven languages.

01:26:32.850 --> 01:26:35.523
And he sneaks off to call his broker.

01:26:35.730 --> 01:26:39.689
But we'll never know. You know why?
Cos you're a professional basket case.

01:26:41.250 --> 01:26:43.923
You're too damn scared
to be a real person.

01:26:45.010 --> 01:26:48.639
Go ahead.
Sing us the national anthem, you bozo.

01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:56.200
You got a lady here to see you.

01:27:24.730 --> 01:27:28.006
- Didn't this place used to be blue?
- That was the 15th Precinct.

01:27:28.210 --> 01:27:32.886
Oh, yeah. The smartest thing you can do
right now is walk out of here.

01:27:33.090 --> 01:27:36.605
- I wanna help you guys.
- Why? I don't even want to help us.

01:27:36.810 --> 01:27:39.085
- We're hopeless.
- What's hopeless?

01:27:39.290 --> 01:27:42.839
- Me? You? Those guys? What?
- Those guys are lab rats.

01:27:43.050 --> 01:27:45.325
You got arrested
for one of those lab rats.

01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:49.842
Hate to break it to you, Billy, but
you're not a street fighter any more.

01:27:50.050 --> 01:27:54.168
- You're a den mother.
- I'm a den mother in stir.

01:27:57.290 --> 01:28:00.362
Can you get to Mercy Hospital
and warn Dr Weitzman?

01:28:00.570 --> 01:28:03.482
There's two guys trying to kill him
and they're both cops.

01:28:03.690 --> 01:28:05.806
- Cops?
- Undercover cops.

01:28:06.010 --> 01:28:09.047
One guy's older, with grey hair,
and the other guy's younger.

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:11.286
Come on. They're moving you now.

01:28:11.490 --> 01:28:14.800
I swore this
wasn't gonna happen to me again.

01:28:16.410 --> 01:28:19.163
- What?
- You.

01:28:19.370 --> 01:28:21.759
It's awful.

01:28:48.610 --> 01:28:51.204
Come on. You're breaking my heart.

01:28:54.410 --> 01:28:57.288
You're bustin' my balls.

01:28:58.810 --> 01:29:00.960
How're you doin'?

01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:08.527
<i> Lieutenant Harrison</i>
<i>to the dispatch office.</i>

01:29:13.370 --> 01:29:17.443
- Where did you get this little beauty?
- That bust down on Canal Street.

01:29:17.650 --> 01:29:20.039
No serial number, no sales record.

01:29:20.250 --> 01:29:23.640
All it does is go "Ping".

01:29:33.490 --> 01:29:35.128
Missed you.

01:29:39.250 --> 01:29:44.199
Well, you boys look like
you're already back on Thorazine.

01:29:55.210 --> 01:29:57.405
What did he say?

01:29:57.610 --> 01:30:00.408
He called me a shithead.

01:30:00.610 --> 01:30:04.159
The guy called me a shithead.
I love it! I love it.

01:30:04.370 --> 01:30:06.930
You're right. I was a shithead.
I'm sorry.

01:30:07.130 --> 01:30:10.008
Albert, this might be
the highlight of my report.

01:30:10.210 --> 01:30:12.326
It's a goddamn miracle.

01:30:12.530 --> 01:30:16.409
It's not a miracle, Jack. It's not.
Weitzman knew what he was doing.

01:30:16.610 --> 01:30:18.202
Weitzman knew what he was doing.

01:30:18.410 --> 01:30:20.844
Albert told me where to get off.
That's progress.

01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:24.520
You went home, discovered you
weren't the department of sanitation.

01:30:24.730 --> 01:30:29.246
Jack, you remembered you're
a better copywriter than a messiah.

01:30:29.450 --> 01:30:31.486
I got news for you psychos.

01:30:34.050 --> 01:30:36.280
We're getting better.

01:30:36.490 --> 01:30:40.881
We're getting better and we won't
go back to finger-painting class.

01:30:42.250 --> 01:30:44.559
Are we gonna let those cops
bury Weitzman?

01:30:47.130 --> 01:30:49.086
Are we?

01:30:50.170 --> 01:30:52.126
Are we?

01:30:52.330 --> 01:30:54.480
Are we?

01:31:04.730 --> 01:31:07.244
- What's wrong with him?
- He's gotta take a leak.

01:31:07.450 --> 01:31:08.644
Tell him to hold it.

01:31:08.850 --> 01:31:11.808
OK, but it's gonna be like
driving in a litter box.

01:31:13.050 --> 01:31:15.359
Dr Talmer,
I'm gonna take one of them back in.

01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:24.887
Don't move. This man's insane.

01:31:25.090 --> 01:31:27.843
Get your ass over there.
Nice going, Albert.

01:31:28.050 --> 01:31:30.086
Another win for the Yankees.

01:31:31.090 --> 01:31:33.763
I'll take that, Albert.

01:31:33.970 --> 01:31:38.600
Henry, give the gun back to the guard.
I know I can count on you.

01:31:38.810 --> 01:31:42.689
I appreciate that. I hope this won't
affect my standing at the hospital.

01:31:42.890 --> 01:31:44.289
- Let me hold the gun.
- No.

01:31:44.490 --> 01:31:47.163
I let you sit in the front seat.

01:31:49.210 --> 01:31:53.408
Jack, Jesus Christ would never
point a gun at another human being.

01:31:53.610 --> 01:31:58.001
Stay out of my psychosis
and get your ass in that van.

01:32:01.210 --> 01:32:03.326
I hope these aren't too tight, fellas.

01:32:05.770 --> 01:32:08.568
I hope everyone got
the partners they wanted.

01:32:10.970 --> 01:32:13.245
Yeah!

01:32:13.450 --> 01:32:15.759
Come on!

01:32:18.930 --> 01:32:21.524
If we're not at Eastside Psychiatric
in 15 minutes,

01:32:21.730 --> 01:32:24.483
every policeman in this city
will be looking for you.

01:32:24.690 --> 01:32:26.840
Then that's where we're going.

01:32:34.810 --> 01:32:38.883
- They're getting pretty worked up.
- Try 25 milligrams of Thorazine.

01:32:39.090 --> 01:32:42.321
I don't know if 25 will do it.
We had to restrain one of them.

01:32:42.530 --> 01:32:45.408
Let's go for 50. Or 100. What the hell?

01:32:47.450 --> 01:32:49.918
- You're making a mistake!
- I'm a psychiatrist!

01:32:50.130 --> 01:32:53.122
I'm a doctor! I'm Dr Talmer!
You don't understand!

01:32:53.330 --> 01:32:56.447
Paranoid delusion.
They think they're doctors. Tragic.

01:32:56.650 --> 01:32:59.039
Go easy on them.
They've been through a lot.

01:33:20.490 --> 01:33:23.402
Weitzman?

01:33:25.890 --> 01:33:27.881
555. Thanks.

01:33:31.050 --> 01:33:33.359
Wait a second! Yo!

01:33:53.770 --> 01:33:55.726
Albert, sit up here.

01:33:57.970 --> 01:34:01.519
All I want you to do it sit here
and stay out of trouble, OK?

01:34:01.730 --> 01:34:04.244
You better give me that gun
for safekeeping.

01:34:11.050 --> 01:34:14.440
All I'm asking you for is
a couple of minutes of sanity in there.

01:34:14.650 --> 01:34:18.006
We're doctors, remember?
We're not wackos, OK?

01:34:18.210 --> 01:34:21.839
Not a peep out of the Messiah.
I'm not gonna make any death threats.

01:34:22.050 --> 01:34:25.929
Henry... Actually, Henry, do your stuff.

01:34:26.130 --> 01:34:28.121
Ready? Let's go.

01:34:40.370 --> 01:34:42.804
It's hard to believe
the patients could do this.

01:34:43.010 --> 01:34:45.649
The Lord will judge them,
Dr Bauer, not you.

01:34:45.850 --> 01:34:48.410
Sure. You know their pathology
better than I do.

01:34:48.610 --> 01:34:52.364
- That we do.
- Arise and walk, my son.

01:34:52.570 --> 01:34:56.324
Dr McDermott's a great believer in
the natural healing powers of the mind.

01:35:07.370 --> 01:35:09.759
This is Dr Meekum,
our chief neurologist.

01:35:09.970 --> 01:35:12.086
We have some reservations
about the move.

01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:16.522
The guy only weighs 150 pounds wet.
It's not like you're moving a piano.

01:35:16.730 --> 01:35:18.960
Excuse me,
do you have an extra stethoscope?

01:35:19.170 --> 01:35:21.479
Sure. Take this one.

01:35:21.690 --> 01:35:24.204
How about one of those ear lights.

01:35:27.370 --> 01:35:29.406
I love these things.

01:35:29.610 --> 01:35:31.999
Come on, Henry.

01:35:38.250 --> 01:35:40.400
- 555?
- Down on the right.

01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:45.921
The patient has a fractured ankle.

01:35:46.130 --> 01:35:49.202
But I'm more concerned
about the trauma of the parietal lobe.

01:35:49.410 --> 01:35:51.605
I'm concerned too. This chart is a mess.

01:35:51.810 --> 01:35:54.643
Smudges, poor penmanship,
no regard for margins.

01:35:54.850 --> 01:35:58.638
- Dr Verboven is a perfectionist.
- That's why he's a great diagnostician.

01:35:58.850 --> 01:36:01.489
Vital signs are good.
Zip code checks out.

01:36:01.690 --> 01:36:04.329
Dr Meekum, thank you.
You're my kind of neurologist.

01:36:04.530 --> 01:36:06.885
Fellas, let's do it.

01:36:14.890 --> 01:36:17.450
Hey, I know you. Yeah, Dwight, right?

01:36:17.650 --> 01:36:19.402
Yeah, you can read!

01:36:19.610 --> 01:36:24.525
- Yeah. You used to work at Lenox Hill.
- Maybe I did. You never know.

01:36:24.730 --> 01:36:26.960
We were just wondering

01:36:27.170 --> 01:36:30.287
why a good-Iooking guy like you
has stayed single for so long.

01:36:30.490 --> 01:36:34.005
Dwight Smith was born single
and Dwight Smith's gonna die single.

01:36:34.210 --> 01:36:38.726
Dwight Smith is gonna die unemployed
if he doesn't get that monitor to OR.

01:36:38.930 --> 01:36:41.080
- Bye, Dwight.
- See you.

01:36:46.130 --> 01:36:49.486
Billy. I think they're here.

01:36:52.650 --> 01:36:56.928
Well, we're going to lose you. Your
colleagues have come to take you home.

01:36:57.130 --> 01:36:59.769
I bet you didn't expect
to see us, did you?

01:36:59.970 --> 01:37:03.121
- Look who's here. Dr Verboven.
- Henry.

01:37:03.330 --> 01:37:05.924
Dr Henry Verboven. That's right.

01:37:06.130 --> 01:37:08.360
And Nurse McDermott made it as well.

01:37:10.970 --> 01:37:14.645
- They're very close.
- Quite a devoted staff, Dr Weitzman.

01:37:14.850 --> 01:37:17.159
We're under a bit of a time crunch here.

01:37:17.370 --> 01:37:21.079
Officer Ianuzzi is waiting
in an ambulance. So, shall we?

01:37:21.290 --> 01:37:24.327
Dr Bauer, could I have
a few moments with my colleagues?

01:37:24.530 --> 01:37:26.805
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

01:37:28.410 --> 01:37:30.970
- What, what, what?
- Hey.

01:37:36.210 --> 01:37:39.122
- Riley.
- Dr Riley?

01:37:39.330 --> 01:37:41.446
No, just Riley.

01:37:43.130 --> 01:37:45.166
I have a feeling it's time for group.

01:37:47.250 --> 01:37:50.003
I gave my clipboard to my daughter.

01:37:50.210 --> 01:37:54.567
I went back to the agency. If they get
Mitachi they'll need some good copy.

01:37:54.770 --> 01:37:56.886
I might have to let Murray go, though.

01:37:59.130 --> 01:38:01.564
- Get me security.
- Get him to the ambulance.

01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:06.725
Excuse me. Obscene phone calls
have been made from this extension.

01:38:06.930 --> 01:38:09.046
This isn't for personal use, girls.

01:38:09.250 --> 01:38:13.038
Come on. Next time you guys get
the urge, use a payphone, OK?

01:38:13.250 --> 01:38:16.003
Come on. Hey.

01:38:31.850 --> 01:38:34.364
Wait a minute.

01:39:00.850 --> 01:39:03.648
- Oh, God!
- Albert, are you OK?

01:39:03.850 --> 01:39:05.841
Safe at home.

01:39:10.130 --> 01:39:12.007
Henry! Do something!

01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:21.207
Damn. I really love these things.

01:39:36.330 --> 01:39:39.402
- Where are Riley and Weitzman?
- They went that way.

01:39:57.650 --> 01:39:59.720
- Oh!
- Game's over.

01:40:00.770 --> 01:40:02.806
- Wrong.
- Yes, Billy!

01:40:03.010 --> 01:40:05.570
- I'll shoot the girl.
- Go ahead.

01:40:05.770 --> 01:40:09.809
- I got lots of girlfriends.
- I'm a police officer. Drop the gun.

01:40:10.010 --> 01:40:12.524
I'm a mental patient. I'm not impressed.

01:40:13.890 --> 01:40:19.123
- You're not this crazy, are you?
- This is my idea of a good time.

01:40:19.330 --> 01:40:21.639
- I'm gonna count to three.
- Billy!

01:40:23.250 --> 01:40:26.765
I'm not even gonna count.
Give me the gun.

01:40:26.970 --> 01:40:30.485
Give me the gun!
Get your ass against the wall.

01:40:31.890 --> 01:40:35.485
- Come here.
- What's this about the girlfriends?!

01:40:35.690 --> 01:40:39.569
He thought I was gonna shoot!
You thought I was gonna shoot, right?

01:40:39.770 --> 01:40:43.206
See? Turn your ass around
or I'll blow your head off.

01:40:44.890 --> 01:40:47.723
Attaboy.

01:40:47.930 --> 01:40:50.569
<i>Statements from Dr Weitzman</i>
<i>and the four patients</i>

01:40:50.770 --> 01:40:54.683
<i>have resulted in the arrest of two</i>
<i>detectives from the 15th Precinct,</i>

01:40:54.890 --> 01:40:59.168
<i>who murdered Officer Alvarez</i>
<i>and attempted to murder Dr Weitzman.</i>

01:40:59.370 --> 01:41:02.248
<i>The four patients received high praise</i>
<i>from Captain Lewis</i>

01:41:02.450 --> 01:41:04.884
<i>and from Police Commissioner Warden.</i>

01:41:05.090 --> 01:41:09.447
<i> At the Bronx Zoo today,</i>
<i>officials welcomed two new pandas,</i>

01:41:09.650 --> 01:41:12.289
<i>a gift from</i>
<i>the People's Republic of China.</i>

01:41:12.490 --> 01:41:15.721
This is weird. All these cops around
and nobody's arresting me.

01:41:17.370 --> 01:41:20.123
- Do you miss it?
- No.

01:41:20.330 --> 01:41:23.367
The only thing I've missed
in the last year and a half is you.

01:41:25.090 --> 01:41:27.923
- Don't get too normal on me, OK?
- Not a chance.

01:41:29.450 --> 01:41:31.122
Hey, Doc.

01:41:32.770 --> 01:41:36.001
- Do you think he's ready to get out?
- Yes.

01:41:36.210 --> 01:41:39.486
- The prognosis looks pretty good.
- Henry, I'll field this one.

01:41:41.010 --> 01:41:43.843
I agree with my colleague.
It looks pretty good.

01:41:44.050 --> 01:41:47.042
Billy, we gotta go.
Are you sure you can drive this thing?

01:41:47.250 --> 01:41:49.525
Second at Daytona.

01:41:56.210 --> 01:41:59.646
- Where are Talmer and Verboven?
- Eastside Psychiatric.

01:41:59.850 --> 01:42:02.603
- What are they doing there?
- I had them committed.

01:42:02.810 --> 01:42:05.608
They were totally out of control, Doc.
Wacko.

01:42:05.810 --> 01:42:09.086
- You'd have done the same thing.
- Medication was indicated.

01:42:09.290 --> 01:42:13.681
I prescribed 100 milligrams
of Thorazine. It'll be in the report.

01:42:13.890 --> 01:42:16.484
I've had my differences
with Henry in the past,

01:42:16.690 --> 01:42:20.126
but I must say he impressed me
with his thorough professionalism.

01:42:34.170 --> 01:42:37.640
Thursday. Chicken Ã  la king.

01:42:37.850 --> 01:42:41.206
- TV.
- Ping pong with Kenny.

01:42:50.370 --> 01:42:52.565
Did Albert just talk to you?

01:42:52.770 --> 01:42:56.399
Yeah. He said they're playing two
tonight at the stadium.

01:42:56.610 --> 01:42:58.965
We still have $42 left.

01:43:01.130 --> 01:43:04.281
42 bucks would get us four
in the bleachers and a couple of dogs.

01:43:06.330 --> 01:43:08.924
Are you suggesting an unsupervised trip?

01:43:10.810 --> 01:43:13.449
You didn't do us a lot of good
on the last one, Doc.

01:43:37.943 --> 01:43:40.364
Hey, Bill.

01:43:41.610 --> 01:43:44.124
Bring me back a dog, would you?

01:43:48.330 --> 01:43:50.639
Hey, guys, is it time for a hug?

01:43:50.850 --> 01:43:53.808
- I don't think so.
- Maybe after the game.

01:43:54.010 --> 01:43:55.966
Play ball!

01:44:01.370 --> 01:44:07.161

01:45:52.770 --> 01:45:54.647

01:45:54.850 --> 01:45:56.727
<i>- You are ridiculous!</i>
<i>- What?</i>

01:45:56.930 --> 01:46:01.208
<i>Why don't you just pack your little</i>
<i>suitcases and go on back to Bogalusa?</i>

01:46:01.410 --> 01:46:03.526
<i>- Yeah!</i>
<i>- Well, I just may do that, baby.</i>

01:46:03.730 --> 01:46:06.847
<i>I just may go hit the road</i>
<i>and try to find myself.</i>

01:46:07.050 --> 01:46:10.963
<i>Find yourself!</i>
<i>Well, if you do, and when you do...</i>

01:46:11.170 --> 01:46:12.762
<i>- Get lost!</i>
<i>- Who, me?</i>

01:46:12.970 --> 01:46:15.279
