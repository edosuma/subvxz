WEBVTT

00:03.104 --> 00:05.104
Welcome, everyone, to Big
Dinner, where the news is big,

00:05.106 --> 00:06.705
and the dinner
is regular size.

00:06.707 --> 00:08.474
Not to be confused
with Big Supper,

00:08.476 --> 00:11.310
where we eat dinner
and we watch the movie<i> Big.</i>

00:11.312 --> 00:14.213
The movie about a grown woman
who has sex with a little boy?
What?

00:14.215 --> 00:15.981
She didn't know.
SCHMIDT:
Tonight we gather

00:15.983 --> 00:19.385
to celebrate Jess and I's final
weekend inside the chrysalis

00:19.387 --> 00:22.054
of professional
mediocrity before Monday,

00:22.056 --> 00:24.456
when we burst forth
in fully pupated positions.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.692
Principal Day.
Director of...

00:26.694 --> 00:28.894
Non-Television, Non-Radio
West Coast Marketing.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.295
And Principal Day.

00:30.297 --> 00:31.797
Sorry. I should have
waited till the end.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.132
What's "pupatated"?
SCHMIDT: Okay.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.533
It's time for the rites
of passage.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.201
Ding, ding, ding.
I have some Big Dinner

00:36.203 --> 00:37.970
news of my own.
SCHMIDT:
Winston, sit down!

00:37.972 --> 00:40.539
The topics for Big Dinner
have already been decided.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.975
As you all know, Aly and I
have recently become engaged.

00:42.977 --> 00:45.210
(whistling, applause)

00:45.212 --> 00:47.312
I receive all that love,
and then I give it right back.

00:47.314 --> 00:49.515
Anyway, as we were saying...
I got to finish this.
It's really important.

00:49.517 --> 00:51.016
In order to get married,

00:51.018 --> 00:53.152
I have commenced
divorce proceedings

00:53.154 --> 00:54.720
with my wife...

00:54.722 --> 00:55.988
Rhonda, yeah.
Rhonda.

00:55.990 --> 00:57.823
Ding, ding, ding, ding.
Real quick.

00:57.825 --> 00:58.857
I hate Rhonda.

00:58.859 --> 01:00.826
(growls):
Hey, that's my wife!

01:00.828 --> 01:02.027
Such a good Harrison Ford.

01:02.029 --> 01:03.328
Who you married as a prank.

01:03.330 --> 01:04.863
Which, for the record,
no one gets.

01:04.865 --> 01:06.231
NICK: Ding, ding, ding, ding.
What the hell is going on here?

01:06.233 --> 01:07.266
If everybody's jumping in,
I'm gonna jump in.

01:07.268 --> 01:08.534
Reagan says my room
looks stupid,

01:08.536 --> 01:11.503
like a teenager lives there.
She's correct.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.372
No one's authorized
to ding, ding, ding
except for Schmidt and I.

01:13.374 --> 01:14.907
And you you're not supposed
to say "ding, ding, ding"

01:14.909 --> 01:16.175
when you ding, ding, ding.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.276
SCHMIDT:
Guys, please.

01:17.278 --> 01:18.677
These are all common topics.

01:18.679 --> 01:22.448
This is why I proposed Common
Lunch, but nobody showed up.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.116
Don't yell at us
'cause you guys are freaking out

01:24.118 --> 01:25.851
about your new jobs.
I am not freaking out.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.286
I have been preparing
for this job

01:27.288 --> 01:29.254
ever since I was young
enough to believe

01:29.256 --> 01:30.789
(chuckles):
leprechauns were real.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.057
Leprechauns<i> are</i> real.

01:32.059 --> 01:33.392
Yeah, I caught one.
He caught one.

01:33.394 --> 01:34.793
We're not having the freaking
leprechaun debate

01:34.795 --> 01:36.195
right now;
we'll be here for hours.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.764
Leprechauns are real.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.299
Now, it's time for
the rites of passage.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.201
Finally.
("Pomp and Circumstance" plays)

01:42.203 --> 01:43.802
Oh.
Schmidt,

01:43.804 --> 01:47.639
I present to you a new set
of business cards.

01:47.641 --> 01:48.807
All right.

01:48.809 --> 01:49.708
So proud of you.

01:53.114 --> 01:55.280
Okay.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.783
That took a lot less time
than I thought it would.

01:57.785 --> 01:58.817
All right.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.452
And now the donning

02:00.454 --> 02:01.787
of the
principal's blazer.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.089
Oh, the principal's blazer.

02:04.091 --> 02:06.658
I remember when
you got that ten years ago

02:06.660 --> 02:08.127
and promised
you would never wear it

02:08.129 --> 02:10.028
till you were
actually principal.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.832
Principal Day.
(applause)

02:16.170 --> 02:18.137
You okay?
I don't think it fits.

02:18.139 --> 02:20.305
No, no, you look great.
Everything looks perfect to me.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.607
Looks great.
Are you okay, honey?

02:21.609 --> 02:23.075
I'm okay.

02:23.077 --> 02:24.476
(sewing machine whirring)

02:26.780 --> 02:27.913
It's the middle of the night.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.516
Yeah, just making a few,
uh, minor adjustments.

02:32.086 --> 02:33.418
Have you seen
my scissors?

02:33.420 --> 02:35.521
Never mind. I have
32 seam rippers right here.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.022
Are you okay?

02:41.362 --> 02:43.262
(chuckles)

02:43.264 --> 02:44.863
It's gonna be fine.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.534
♪ ♪

02:51.305 --> 02:53.705
Hey, Schmidt. Can I get
a second opinion on something?

02:53.707 --> 02:56.208
Oh, about your room? Reagan's
right. You need to redecorate.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.976
It looks like you live in
an abandoned day care.

02:57.978 --> 03:01.280
(chuckles): That is not what an
abandoned day care looks like.

03:02.149 --> 03:04.149
You can trust me.

03:04.151 --> 03:05.651
Hello?

03:05.653 --> 03:07.886
Can I take a nap now?

03:10.958 --> 03:13.659
Okay, we need to talk about that
a lot more later.

03:13.661 --> 03:14.960
I'm worried about Jess.

03:14.962 --> 03:17.129
I think she is
freaking out about work

03:17.131 --> 03:19.665
and she's channeling
all of it into her blazer.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.868
She's got a real
"cat in a bathtub" vibe.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.171
Hey, guys!

03:26.173 --> 03:27.806
I'm just blasting
some<i> Jock Jams,</i>

03:27.808 --> 03:30.142
getting my fashion on!

03:30.144 --> 03:32.177
What's the problem?
This is Jess at a six.

03:32.179 --> 03:34.313
SCHMIDT: Sorry there, Jess.
JESS: Mm-hmm.

03:34.315 --> 03:35.514
Nick here says
you're freaking out.

03:35.516 --> 03:36.515
What's going on, girl?

03:36.517 --> 03:39.151
I am so good.

03:39.153 --> 03:40.385
I am "saw" good.

03:40.387 --> 03:43.322
I am so "gawd."
So "gawd."

03:43.324 --> 03:46.358
We can't let her go to work
on Monday like that.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.660
Remember what I used to do
for you in college

03:48.662 --> 03:50.662
when you'd get nervous
about exams?

03:50.664 --> 03:52.598
What did I do for you?
What was that thing called?

03:52.600 --> 03:53.932
Boy ride!
Rumspringa!

03:54.935 --> 03:56.435
What?
Rumspringa.

03:56.437 --> 03:57.436
I said "Rumspringa."

03:57.438 --> 03:59.271
So did I.
No, you said "boy ride."

03:59.273 --> 04:01.506
No, I said "Rumspringa."
What's a boy ride, dude?

04:01.508 --> 04:03.842
Rumspringa, boy ride.
Boy ride saved my life.

04:03.844 --> 04:06.278
I would be freaking out,
and you would take me

04:06.280 --> 04:07.579
on these wild adventures.

04:07.581 --> 04:08.847
Bio exam?

04:08.849 --> 04:10.449
Casino time.
(chuckles) Yeah.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.217
Intro to
environmental feminism?

04:12.219 --> 04:13.852
I remember.
Corn maze.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.687
That was the day we found out
that corn is maize.

04:15.689 --> 04:16.788
(imitates explosion)

04:16.790 --> 04:19.224
Do we take Jess
on a little Rumspringa?

04:19.226 --> 04:20.392
CECE:
<i> Can you just give me, like,</i>

04:20.394 --> 04:22.094
a five-minute warning
before Rhonda gets here?

04:22.096 --> 04:24.229
I'd like to be... not here.

04:24.231 --> 04:26.198
Look, Rhonda shows up
when Rhonda shows up.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.532
I know. That's the problem.

04:27.534 --> 04:29.635
There's nothing I hate more
than women talking about

04:29.637 --> 04:31.069
their rings
in a high-pitched voice,

04:31.071 --> 04:32.204
(high-pitched):
but, oh, my God,

04:32.206 --> 04:33.939
I love my ring so much!
I love it!

04:33.941 --> 04:34.806
Aw.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.208
I love that ring
on your finger.

04:36.210 --> 04:37.409
I just want to
bite it off

04:37.411 --> 04:38.644
and swallow it,

04:38.646 --> 04:40.912
and then digest it properly.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.914
And then give it back to
you in a day and a half.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.483
Oh, my God,
I think I'm gonna cry.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.917
You guys have
such a weird dynamic.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.519
(both chuckle)
RHONDA: Hello, Winston.

04:48.822 --> 04:52.224
Hey, Rhonda.

04:52.226 --> 04:54.493
You wanted to sign
the divorce papers,

04:54.495 --> 04:57.829
and-and I thought this was...

04:57.831 --> 05:00.132
this was a good a time as any.

05:01.268 --> 05:05.237
But I know it's a shock, but...

05:05.239 --> 05:07.873
meet your son.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.678
Oh, my God.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.046
Um...

05:20.988 --> 05:22.354
(chuckles)

05:24.458 --> 05:25.957
Now, you listen to me, baby.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.459
(chuckles)

05:27.461 --> 05:29.461
My father walked out on me,
and I swear

05:29.463 --> 05:31.363
I will never do that to you.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.166
That's so sweet.

05:40.274 --> 05:43.141
(whispering):
You just got Rhonda'd.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.644
Rhonda'd.
(chuckles)

05:45.646 --> 05:48.313
(snickers)
No...

05:48.315 --> 05:49.314
Oh, my God!

05:49.316 --> 05:51.116
Did you just prank me
with a baby?

05:51.118 --> 05:52.117
(laughing):
A human baby.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.318
What the hell?

05:53.320 --> 05:56.655
That is amazing!
Oh, my God.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.790
Oh, I can feel my heartbeat
through the back of my head!

05:58.792 --> 06:00.125
You just took years off my life!

06:00.127 --> 06:01.626
You are the master!

06:01.628 --> 06:03.128
Where'd that
baby come from?

06:03.130 --> 06:04.196
Oh, he came
from Dave.

06:04.198 --> 06:06.498
Who's Dave?
Hi-yo!

06:06.500 --> 06:07.566
Dave, take a bow.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.034
Thank you.
Uh, thank you.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.036
RHONDA:
This is my cousin.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.904
I'm staying with him
while I'm in town.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.673
So he's your baby?

06:14.675 --> 06:15.741
(chuckles):
Oh, no.

06:15.743 --> 06:16.808
I'm an obstetrician.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.243
I just borrowed
this little guy.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.579
(laughter)

06:20.581 --> 06:22.214
Rhonda, I'm Aly,
Winston's fiancée.

06:22.216 --> 06:24.816
It's so nice to meet you,
I think.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.752
All of us are coming down
from this a little too quickly,

06:26.754 --> 06:28.720
'cause what that guy did
is a felony.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.155
Congrats on
your engagement.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.223
WINSTON:
Thank you.
No one cares.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.924
But you can't do
it without... these.

06:32.926 --> 06:33.825
Thank God.

06:33.827 --> 06:36.161
They 'bout to
be "soined"!

06:36.163 --> 06:37.662
(sighs)

06:37.664 --> 06:39.831
The end to one of
my best pranks.

06:39.833 --> 06:40.999
Oh, this feels good.

06:41.001 --> 06:41.900
Yeah.
(Winston laughs)

06:41.902 --> 06:43.235
That's it.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.836
That's it.
All right.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.505
Well, I better go.

06:46.507 --> 06:47.773
I really hope you two are happy.

06:47.775 --> 06:49.040
No prank.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.676
So until we cross
paths again...

06:56.617 --> 06:58.417
She's a lot.

06:58.419 --> 06:59.351
Understatement of the year.

06:59.353 --> 07:00.685
She is, but, you know,

the good news is,
is we never, ever

Okay.

I also know that my jacket

07:21.442 --> 07:22.941

when did I add

07:24.411 --> 07:25.710
a fourth sleeve?

First day jitters, Jess.
It's totally normal,

07:31.418 --> 07:32.918
and we have the answer.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.920
Rumspringa.
Boy ride.

07:34.922 --> 07:37.289
Rumspringa is
a hallowed Amish tradition,

07:37.291 --> 07:39.124
not a one-day buddy comedy.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.292
Second of all,

07:40.294 --> 07:42.127
I don't want to go to a casino

07:42.129 --> 07:44.229
or a sexual petting zoo.

Great Rumspringa, guys!
I'm gonna hit the road.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.777
I need to work on my blazer.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.278

all-day parking, so you're out

08:00.280 --> 08:01.980
of your mind
if you think we're leaving now.

08:01.982 --> 08:05.116
Jess, resistance is the
classic first stage.

08:05.118 --> 08:07.786
Just enjoy this!
It's so cool.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.988
Look at this sign.
Look at this sign.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.457
"When did it become a crime
to rhyme all the time?"

08:12.459 --> 08:14.793
(laughs)
So true.
(chuckles)

08:14.795 --> 08:16.795
And it's really funny.
Somebody just thought of that.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.630
Do you think a teenager
would hang this on his wall?

08:18.632 --> 08:20.632
No.
I don't either. I just got
a vision for my room.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.033
Excuse me.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.301
Okay, I got to go home,
and I got to work

08:23.303 --> 08:24.803
on my morning announcement
voice.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.638
(softly): "My morning
announcement voice."

08:26.640 --> 08:28.807
(cheerily):
"My morning announcement voice."

08:28.809 --> 08:30.375
I think the last one was close.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.377
I really think
you're overthinking this.

08:32.379 --> 08:35.213
Just do what I do--
exude confidence all the time.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.882
But you're the boss now.
You-you can't skate by

08:36.884 --> 08:38.483
on confidence alone.

08:38.485 --> 08:40.485
Who says I can't?
Well, I couldn't
get away with it.

08:40.487 --> 08:42.487
I'd always be worried that
someone would figure out

08:42.489 --> 08:44.055
I didn't know what I was doing.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.158
I'd be terrified as hell.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.794
Nah. I'm good.

08:49.796 --> 08:52.464
I'm so good.
Well, I'm not.

08:52.466 --> 08:53.965
I have to go home
and work on my blazer.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.467
So I found a bus
ticket back...
Well, hold on.

08:55.469 --> 08:57.636
I think there's somebody that
you would like to meet, Jess.

08:57.638 --> 09:00.472
MAN: Greetings,
yon settlers three!

09:00.474 --> 09:04.976
Are there folksy,
old-timey reenactors here?

09:04.978 --> 09:08.179
'Cause that would be, like,
a total freaking game changer.

09:08.181 --> 09:12.918
I am one of the founders
of this town of Solvang,

09:12.920 --> 09:14.553
Professor P.P. Hornsyld.

09:14.555 --> 09:15.554
Is this really
what you're into?

09:15.556 --> 09:18.056
And so begins
phase two, enjoyment.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.424
At your service.

09:19.426 --> 09:21.192
I have 87 questions for you.
When were you born?

09:21.194 --> 09:23.361
When did you die? Where were
you born? Where did you die?

09:23.363 --> 09:25.697
Are you a spirit? What
do you think of the modern era?

09:25.699 --> 09:26.898
What do you think of technology?

09:26.900 --> 09:29.000
Perhaps you'd like
to try some aquavit,

09:29.002 --> 09:30.835
a traditional drink
from the motherland.

09:30.837 --> 09:32.237
Perhaps you will enjoy
its humors

09:32.239 --> 09:33.738
more than you enjoy peppering me

09:33.740 --> 09:35.240
with this endless barrage
of questions.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.075
(laughs)
(chuckles)

09:37.077 --> 09:38.944
(laughs)

09:38.946 --> 09:41.746
I can't believe you fell for
the disappearing ink trick!

09:41.748 --> 09:43.381
Ah, ha, ha!

09:43.383 --> 09:45.584
That was Rhonda,
that was Rhonda.

09:45.586 --> 09:49.054
Rhonda? Grow up, stop acting
like Dennis the freaking Menace,

09:49.056 --> 09:51.523
and sign the papers.
The pranks stop right now.

09:51.525 --> 09:53.224
I just wish
I could've seen your face.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.126
You are being a turd.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.861
Aly hates pranks.
What?

09:56.863 --> 09:57.963
Yeah.
Like a normal person.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.264
No disrespect, Aly,

09:59.266 --> 10:01.032
but that's basic.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.934
Okay. That's very disrespectful.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.770
Winston, I'm worried
about you marrying her.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.607
Here's a prank. I'm, I'm gon...
I'm gonna kick you in the head.

10:08.609 --> 10:11.209
See, that's not a prank.
See? Winston, I'm worried.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.745
Stop being a turd!

10:13.747 --> 10:16.314
Now we're never
getting a divorce!
You're a crazy person.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.316
It's just gonna be
pranks for life!
What?

10:18.318 --> 10:20.285
Pranks at 50, pranks
at 60, pranks at 80.
Aly, ignore her.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.420
Pranks in the nursing home.
We'll figure something out.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.255
Hey, you're small.

10:24.257 --> 10:25.557
What?

10:25.559 --> 10:26.992
I'm looking for somebody small

10:26.994 --> 10:29.461
for a prank I'm cooking up.

10:29.463 --> 10:30.862
(exhales)

10:31.999 --> 10:34.499
Actually, I could
use all of you.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.134
WINSTON: Okay, look. Rhonda,
yeah. This won't work.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.336
Aly, you don't have to do this.

10:38.338 --> 10:41.239
RHONDA: If you do this for me,
I'll give you your divorce.

10:43.276 --> 10:46.311
If this is what I have to do
to marry you, then...

10:46.313 --> 10:48.279
Rhonda, the three of us
will do your prank.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.749
CECE: Wait, what? I have
in no way consented to this.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.617
Gonna do a group Rhonda!
That's awesome.

10:52.619 --> 10:55.987
Uh, how do you feel about having
a bunch of jelly on your head?

10:55.989 --> 10:57.656
Not good, Rhonda.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.290
Hey, Jess.
Mm.

10:59.292 --> 11:00.325
Could you make
a pillow out of this?

11:00.327 --> 11:01.593
You know damn
well I could make

11:01.595 --> 11:02.927
a pillow out of anything.

11:02.929 --> 11:05.296
Definite buy, bro. Aquavit me.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.132
I'm thinking of making
a throw pillow for my room.

11:07.134 --> 11:10.001
Uh, teenagers don't have
throw pillows, right?

11:10.003 --> 11:11.970
Whoa. Why you packing
up? It's only 4:30.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.838
Yeah, it's Sunday.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.640
Everything around here
closes pretty early.

11:15.642 --> 11:16.641
Sundays.

11:16.643 --> 11:18.677
I'm just getting my rum sprung!

11:18.679 --> 11:20.478
Stinks.
What am I gonna do, Nick?

11:20.480 --> 11:22.981
I don't...
Nick, I don't think I'm
ready for this new job.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.482
I'm freaking out. And there's
not enough aebleskivers

11:24.484 --> 11:26.151
in this whole place
to soothe me.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.520
It's not over. Give me a second.
Give me a second.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.657
I think I know
how to keep this party going

11:32.659 --> 11:34.693
just a little bit longer.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.363
Welcome to the distillery.

11:42.302 --> 11:46.705
I'm gonna, uh, make sure that,
that's okay.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.241
Oh, you know what?
It's, um, it's probably just

11:50.243 --> 11:51.843
an old-timey Danish door.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.979
You just need to jiggle
the, um, the<i> dorhandtag.</i>

11:54.981 --> 11:56.314
Yeah. I'm doing that.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.482
Maybe there's another door.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.484
(jiggling door knob)
No, that's it.

11:59.486 --> 12:00.485
Are we trapped?

12:00.487 --> 12:02.654
Wiggle the<i> dorhandtag!</i>

12:02.656 --> 12:04.556
It won't budge! It's locked!
I'll make a call!

12:04.558 --> 12:06.725
Oh, my God.
And there's no service!

12:06.727 --> 12:09.094
Let us out! We have a big day
tomorrow, we need to pupate.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.361
They don't know what that means.

12:10.363 --> 12:11.529
Say something more accessible.

12:11.531 --> 12:12.831
Help!

12:12.833 --> 12:13.932
They have Wi-Fi.
(Jess and Schmidt yelling)

12:13.934 --> 12:15.700
But I don't know the password!

12:15.702 --> 12:17.602
I'm on a real roller coaster
of emotions right now.

12:17.604 --> 12:19.337
Just slamming up
and crashing down!

12:23.777 --> 12:25.376
JESS: Come on, help us, Danes!
Unlike in World War II!

12:25.378 --> 12:26.611
Yeah, I brought it up!

12:26.613 --> 12:28.079
Darn it!
What are we gonna do?

12:28.081 --> 12:30.181
We've been stuck in here
for over an hour!

12:30.183 --> 12:32.851
Okay, yes. Our bodies are
trapped in this cellar,

12:32.853 --> 12:35.687
but our minds can go anywhere.

12:35.689 --> 12:37.455
We have to start
new jobs tomorrow.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.057
Don't you know who I am?
I'm the director of marketing

12:39.059 --> 12:40.859
for Associated Strategies!

12:40.861 --> 12:43.228
Hey, Schmidt. It seems like
you might need a Rumspringa.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.262
Want to go
to a casino?

12:44.264 --> 12:45.463
Pick a number.
Any number, kiddo.

12:45.465 --> 12:46.598
What?
Pick a number.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.133
I don't understand this... 23.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.801
That's wrong.
Fun, though, huh?

12:49.803 --> 12:51.102
How am I wrong?
Was it 19?

12:51.104 --> 12:52.937
It was...
He doesn't need a Rumspringa!

12:52.939 --> 12:55.473
He needs to get
out of this cellar.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.108
I think you're looking at it
wrong. There's still so much fun

12:57.110 --> 12:58.376
to be had in here.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.112
For example,

13:01.114 --> 13:05.083
in three minutes, a bird
is gonna pop out of that clock.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.585
A bird?
Just gonna pop its head out.

13:07.587 --> 13:08.787
Why wait?
What do you mean, why...

13:08.789 --> 13:10.455
(cuckoo clock chiming)
Son of a...

13:11.558 --> 13:13.792
Look, there. I got the bird.

13:13.794 --> 13:14.859
Isn't this fun?

13:16.963 --> 13:19.464
I told you
I didn't want a Rumspringa.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.932
This might've worked

13:20.934 --> 13:22.967
when you were 20,
but we're adults now,

13:22.969 --> 13:24.969
and you can't
handle adult problems

13:24.971 --> 13:26.838
by forgetting about them.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.309
You're right.

13:31.311 --> 13:34.879
Maybe I handle my problems
like a child.

13:36.983 --> 13:40.785
Maybe I decorate my room
like a child.

13:40.787 --> 13:43.121
I mean,
I even undress like a child.

13:43.123 --> 13:44.589
(grunting)

13:46.359 --> 13:48.760
Do you think that's what Reagan
was getting at about my room?

13:48.762 --> 13:51.763
Yeah.
Do you think Reagan thinks
I'm a child?

13:51.765 --> 13:53.364
Mm-hmm.
Okay, now I'm freaking out!

13:53.366 --> 13:55.300
And I'm usually the rock
of this group.

13:55.302 --> 13:59.971
Once you lose old Nicky Miller,
the whole thing falls apart.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.506
WINSTON:
Aah.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.707
Aah, okay.
CECE: She's gonna pop!

14:02.709 --> 14:04.475
How far apart are
the contractions?

14:04.477 --> 14:05.543
Who's asking?
I don't know.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.478
Let's take a look.
(screams)

14:07.480 --> 14:09.480
Wah. I'm a baby.

14:09.482 --> 14:10.682
Oh!

14:10.684 --> 14:12.483
I'm, I'm... coming out.

14:12.485 --> 14:13.484
Uh-uh.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.353
I, I know. I'm rattled, too.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.989
You just got Rhonda'd!

14:17.991 --> 14:20.291
That's for not coming
to the family reunion.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.193
I'm so sorry. We got Rhonda'd.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.996
Uh, Dave? Hello. I, for one,
would like to say I'm sorry.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.464
Did not want
to participate in this at all.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.199
(Rhonda and Dave laugh)
DAVE: You're crazy.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.301
You got me good!

14:30.303 --> 14:32.337
Oh, God. W-What's happening?

14:32.339 --> 14:33.371
My, my skin...

14:33.373 --> 14:35.206
It's burning.
What? What's going on?

14:35.208 --> 14:37.141
The goop, it's burning my skin.
What?

14:37.143 --> 14:39.177
Do something.
My skin's burning, you guys.
What? Baby, baby, you okay?

14:39.179 --> 14:41.546
What did you put on me?
Ow!
Okay. What did you
do to her, Rhonda?!

14:41.548 --> 14:44.148
She didn't want the jelly, so I
used a porcine birthing agent.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.516
What is that?!
I... I...

14:45.518 --> 14:47.986
Well, it's burning!
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.988
You're sorry?!
I...

14:49.990 --> 14:51.489
You should be...

14:51.491 --> 14:54.392
because, baby doll,
you just got Aly'd.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.161
Oh!

14:57.163 --> 14:59.664
Oh, oh!

14:59.666 --> 15:01.165
How you like that, Rhonda?

15:01.167 --> 15:03.101
Who's basic now?
What?

15:03.103 --> 15:05.003
Oh, my God.
Oh!

15:05.005 --> 15:06.170
WINSTON:
Oh, my God,

15:06.172 --> 15:07.906
I thought you were
about to die. My heart...

15:07.908 --> 15:08.773
I died.
She good.

15:08.775 --> 15:10.875
How could you...

15:10.877 --> 15:14.379
do something so amazing?!

15:14.381 --> 15:15.747
(Rhonda shouts)

15:15.749 --> 15:17.882
Just kind of thought
of it on the spot.

15:17.884 --> 15:23.054
Oh, now, not only will you get
a divorce, you have my blessing.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.689
Put your hands away.
Nobody's asking for it.

15:24.691 --> 15:25.757
We don't need that.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.393
(broken clock whirring)

15:28.395 --> 15:30.194
JESS:
Well...

15:30.196 --> 15:32.063
it's 4:00 a.m.
It's official.

15:32.065 --> 15:34.966
I'm missing my first day
as principal.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.736
Got a fresh toilet for you guys.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.638
(clears throat)
Ration them.

15:40.640 --> 15:41.606
Guys, don't give up hope.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.874
Well, I'm fine being trapped.

15:42.876 --> 15:44.409
I don't want to go to work.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.277
Look, we're gonna get
out of here, and when we do,

15:46.279 --> 15:48.313
I'm gonna start...
I'm gonna start growing up.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.114
You have grown up, Nick.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.417
I mean, you own a bar.

15:52.419 --> 15:53.952
You wrote a novel.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.653
I'm talking
about really growing up.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.755
There's still so much
I want to do, like...

15:57.757 --> 15:59.824
I want to try cilantro.
(Schmidt urinating)

15:59.826 --> 16:01.292
You haven't tried cilantro?

16:01.294 --> 16:02.827
I want to figure out
what NASDAQ means.

16:02.829 --> 16:04.128
You've never had salsa?

16:04.130 --> 16:06.464
I want to not shimmy
out of my pants.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.932
Feels good being empty.

16:07.934 --> 16:09.300
I'm sorry I kidnapped you, Jess.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.302
I just hated to see you
with first-day jitters.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.271
What is wrong with me?

16:13.273 --> 16:15.840
I've been preparing for this job
my entire life.

16:15.842 --> 16:19.043
I mean... maybe this'll help.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.814
A bottle of champagne.
(laughs)

16:22.816 --> 16:26.250
A toast to the new
principal, right? Should we?

16:26.252 --> 16:28.152
Is that a bottle of Krug Clos
d'Camaret-du-sur Mer?

16:28.154 --> 16:31.289
Yeah, it absolutely is a bottle
of "Klus Clos de Saminaire."

16:31.291 --> 16:32.957
Little known fact

16:32.959 --> 16:35.626
about the late '90s
Krug Clos d'Camaret-sur-Mer.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.462
According to my father,

16:37.464 --> 16:39.831
they have very strong wire
around the cork.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.299
Well, that anecdote's
ready to go.

16:41.301 --> 16:42.800
Uncork it, Nick.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.669
Go, go, go.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.441
Look at that.

16:50.443 --> 16:51.976
It's like a key.

16:51.978 --> 16:54.946
Almost exactly like a key.

16:54.948 --> 16:55.947
Uh-huh, yep.

16:55.949 --> 16:57.548
(wire jiggling)

16:57.550 --> 16:59.851
Okay.

16:59.853 --> 17:02.020
(latch clicks)

17:04.224 --> 17:06.491
I did it!
Oh.

17:06.493 --> 17:07.959
I didn't even need
to prepare for it.

17:07.961 --> 17:09.360
When Schmidt's back

17:09.362 --> 17:11.829
is up against the wall,
Schmidt shows up

17:11.831 --> 17:13.798
because I have
confidence and skill.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.666
Yeah, yeah, finish your
epiphany on the way.

17:15.668 --> 17:18.069
We got to go.
We got to go.
Let's go to Ass Strat.

17:18.071 --> 17:22.173
Okay, two more hours before...
morning announcements.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.408
I think we can still make it

17:23.410 --> 17:25.076
if we take zero
pee or snack breaks.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.377
Don't worry,
I have five toilets.

17:26.379 --> 17:27.879
I'm still too drunk.
I can't drive.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.747
All right, drunk check.
Drunk.
Drunk.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.649
Crap.
Crap.
Crap.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.084
I'm sure glad we exchanged
numbers yesterday.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.719
Really worked out, huh?

17:34.721 --> 17:36.687
Yeah. So, you guys can really
get me on<i> The Price Is Right.</i>

17:36.689 --> 17:37.688
<i> Ja.</i>

17:37.690 --> 17:39.223
Drew is a good friend.

17:39.225 --> 17:40.358
Road trip!

17:40.360 --> 17:41.826
Boy ride!
Boy ride!

17:41.828 --> 17:43.127
Boy ride!
(laughing): Oh.
Please, can we just go?

17:47.567 --> 17:48.933
The divorce papers are
finalized. Good news.

17:48.935 --> 17:50.435
There's no way this could
be disappearing ink, right?

17:50.437 --> 17:51.836
Well, I mean, the longest
disappearing ink on record

17:51.838 --> 17:53.671
is only 42 minutes,
so, no, we're good.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.873
Great.
I actually had a good
time pranking Rhonda.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.542
No, not you, too. Please.

17:57.544 --> 18:00.011
I mean it. I think
we can kind of

18:00.013 --> 18:01.612
get into this as a couple.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.915
We'll prank,
have some sex...

18:03.917 --> 18:06.084
Mm.
...prank people, have
some more sex, pet the cat.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.718
I'm okay with that life.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.221
I don't understand how
any human being could enjoy it.

18:10.223 --> 18:13.458
Well, because we are pranks,
don't you see?
Huh?

18:13.460 --> 18:17.061
In the Bible,
God created light and dark.

18:17.063 --> 18:19.964
And then separated
the heavens from the oceans.

18:19.966 --> 18:22.733
Then created plants,
then animals.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.769
And the animals, they thought
they had all this cool stuff

18:24.771 --> 18:30.441
to themselves, but then God
pranked the animals with us.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.943
And it was good.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.377
(whispering):
That was so sexy.

18:33.379 --> 18:34.579
Mm-hmm.
That was so sexy.

18:34.581 --> 18:35.913
WINSTON:
I know it was.

18:35.915 --> 18:37.248
Mm-hmm. You like that?

18:37.250 --> 18:38.783
I didn't know you
knew all that.
Mm-hmm.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.351
Trick's on me,
that's for sure.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.555
What? Why are there
adoption papers in here?

18:44.557 --> 18:45.556
Hmm?
What?

18:45.558 --> 18:47.125
There are adoption papers
in here.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.293
What? Let me see this.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.296
Oh, holy hell,

18:52.298 --> 18:54.899
Rhonda adopted Aly...
What?

18:54.901 --> 18:56.634
...in Liberia.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.102
In Liberia?

18:58.104 --> 18:59.270
No, no, this doesn't
make any sense.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.304
(groaning lightly)

19:00.306 --> 19:01.672
"Dear Aly,
please accept

19:01.674 --> 19:05.076
"these divorce papers
as an engagement gift

19:05.078 --> 19:06.911
from Mom."

19:06.913 --> 19:08.346
Ew. She said "Mom"?

19:08.348 --> 19:09.847
I mean, I guess
that's a good prank.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.516
You're my stepdad?

19:11.518 --> 19:12.683
I'm so confused
by what qualifies,

19:12.685 --> 19:13.951
I honestly can't weigh in.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.753
I hate my Liberian mom.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.122
Come here.
Okay, Winston.

19:18.124 --> 19:19.457
Uh-oh.
Not now.

19:19.459 --> 19:20.625
That's so crazy.
Let's just...
Winston.

19:20.627 --> 19:21.859
Okay.
Not now.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.295
JESS:<i> We made it,</i>
<i> and I didn't puke in the car.</i>

19:24.297 --> 19:25.530
(tires screech)

19:25.532 --> 19:27.198
Can we offer you any money
for the bus ride home?

19:27.200 --> 19:29.033
What about<i> The Price Is Right? </i>
We lied.

19:29.035 --> 19:30.501
We have no connection
to<i> The Price Is Right.</i>

19:30.503 --> 19:31.969
Nobody knows Drew.
He-He's a hermit.

19:31.971 --> 19:33.538
You watched me call my mom.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.239
How about $300
to get out of the car?

19:37.143 --> 19:38.209
It's a good deal.

19:38.211 --> 19:40.545
Shut up.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.847
All right, as soon as you
step out of this car, Jess,

19:42.849 --> 19:43.981
you're gonna be a principal.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.150
It's... holiday.
School's closed.

19:46.152 --> 19:48.219
Why are all the
kids going in?
Yeah.

19:48.221 --> 19:49.687
If it's... if the
school is closed,

19:49.689 --> 19:51.556
why are all these
little kids going in?
I agree.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.491
No, I'm asking you.
We should just go.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.825
What are you
talking about, Jess?

19:54.827 --> 19:56.561
It's... get out there,
you're gonna be late.

19:58.531 --> 20:01.165
Schmidt, can I get a...
a minute alone with Jess?

20:01.167 --> 20:03.367
Would you please take
the pee bottles with you?

20:03.369 --> 20:06.837
Sure. A grown man standing
around a bunch of ten-year-olds,

20:06.839 --> 20:08.306
holding bottles
of his own urine.

20:08.308 --> 20:09.574
What could go wrong?

20:14.147 --> 20:18.149
Well, I think I know what's
going on with you, Jess.

20:18.151 --> 20:20.151
I mean, you've always been
on this path,

20:20.153 --> 20:21.986
and now that
you're at the end of it,

20:21.988 --> 20:25.890
and you've reached the goal,
you know, it's a little scary.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.527
Yeah, it's pretty stupid, huh?

20:29.529 --> 20:31.495
No, I don't think it's stupid.

20:31.497 --> 20:35.499
And as a guy who has never had
a path like that,

20:35.501 --> 20:37.602
I'm personally
really excited

20:37.604 --> 20:39.237
to see what happens next.

20:44.277 --> 20:48.112
You know what? I'm gonna
get out of this car...

20:48.114 --> 20:50.181
and I'm gonna go be principal.

20:56.456 --> 20:59.457
Oh. I forgot my blazer.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.759
Way ahead of you, Jess.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.295
Oh. But you were gonna
make a pillow out of that.

21:04.297 --> 21:06.430
Ah, it won't fit in my room.

21:06.432 --> 21:07.898
It's not a good style for me.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.800
(chuckles)
It looks great on you.

21:09.802 --> 21:12.103
Thanks, it fits perfectly.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.473
And, Nick,

21:15.475 --> 21:18.709
I... I like your room
the way it is.

21:18.711 --> 21:22.513
It already has a style.
It's... it's you.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.750
Okay, get to class, kids!

21:25.752 --> 21:28.719
Only five minutes till...
morning announcements.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.254
Go get 'em, Principal Day!

21:30.256 --> 21:34.458
Morning announcements.
Morning announcements.

21:34.460 --> 21:35.960
Nailed it.

21:35.962 --> 21:39.030
<i> Morning announcements.</i>
<i> Morning.</i>
