WEBVTT

00:08.522 --> 00:10.831
Why does being a librarian
make her even hotter?

00:10.832 --> 00:11.968
They're keepers of knowledge.

00:11.969 --> 00:13.643
She holds the answers
to all of our questions,

00:13.644 --> 00:14.276
like, "will you marry me,"

00:14.277 --> 00:16.282
and "why are there still libraries."

00:16.283 --> 00:18.714
I wanna be a book. She can pick me up.

00:18.715 --> 00:19.852
Flip through my pages.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.969
Make sure nobody drew wieners in me.

00:23.086 --> 00:24.863
Hey, maybe if we're too loud,
she'll shush us.

00:24.864 --> 00:25.675
Okay.

00:26.040 --> 00:27.085
Books!

00:27.591 --> 00:28.938
Pretend like you're asleep.

00:32.865 --> 00:33.699
Jeff.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.112
What do you do when
you and your best friend

00:35.113 --> 00:36.834
wanna ask the same girl
to the Valentine's dance,

00:36.835 --> 00:37.987
but neither of you have dibs

00:37.988 --> 00:39.686
because you both fell in love
with her at first sight?

00:39.687 --> 00:42.074
Well, I don't believe in dibs
or love at first sight

00:42.075 --> 00:44.916
or love or best friends or doing things.

00:44.917 --> 00:46.052
But it's good you brought this to me.

00:46.053 --> 00:47.371
You're gonna have to open
your heart one day, Jeff.

00:47.372 --> 00:48.180
What happens if I don't?

00:48.181 --> 00:49.799
I miss the heart opening deadline?

00:49.800 --> 00:51.772
Valentine's Crapentine's.

00:52.745 --> 00:54.396
Opening my heart is on my list.

00:56.160 --> 00:56.750
Pierce?

00:56.751 --> 00:58.306
- Mm-hmm.
- What was that?

00:58.447 --> 01:00.292
- Gum.
- Why aren't you chewing?

01:00.293 --> 01:03.506
Because I'm using my mouth
for this dumb conversation.

01:07.674 --> 01:08.642
Bye.

01:09.470 --> 01:12.410
That's my friend page.
She's cool, but...Whatever.

01:12.535 --> 01:14.719
- She's cute.
- Oh, Troy.

01:14.878 --> 01:16.359
Before you go barking up that tree,

01:16.360 --> 01:18.764
I have to tell you that
she might not be interested.

01:18.765 --> 01:20.314
Why wouldn't she be...

01:20.635 --> 01:22.837
Oh! Is she...

01:23.722 --> 01:24.856
A friend of Ellen?

01:24.857 --> 01:27.095
Yes, Annie. But you can say the word.

01:27.096 --> 01:29.899
Page is a...Lesbian.

01:35.169 --> 01:37.569
Pierce, as someone who's been
calling me a lesbian

01:37.570 --> 01:38.819
for the last year and a half,

01:38.820 --> 01:40.790
I'm sure that you don't have
anything to say

01:40.791 --> 01:42.693
about me being friends with one.

01:43.034 --> 01:44.396
Nothing off the cuff.

01:44.721 --> 01:47.245
What I do have is a prepared statement.

01:58.783 --> 02:02.030
â™ª Give me some rope, time in a tree

02:02.031 --> 02:05.237
give me the hope to run out of steam

02:05.238 --> 02:08.461
somebody said we could be here

02:08.461 --> 02:12.662
we could be roped up,
tied up, dead in a year

02:12.663 --> 02:17.106
I can't count the reasons I should stay

02:17.647 --> 02:21.939
one by one they all just fade away

02:24.847 --> 02:27.057
"And in summation,

02:27.058 --> 02:28.142
"good luck...

02:29.050 --> 02:30.663
And bon appetit."

02:34.733 --> 02:36.410
Many, many paragraphs of that

02:36.411 --> 02:37.979
were oddly supportive.

02:37.980 --> 02:40.488
Wait till you hear the one
I have for you.

02:43.362 --> 02:45.329
Okay. I know that wasn't gum.

02:45.330 --> 02:48.395
You're right.
It was an awesome exit pill.

02:48.396 --> 02:50.626
Zip! Zop! Zooey!

02:51.830 --> 02:52.842

03:02.373 --> 03:04.198
We gotta do something about Pierce
and those pain killers.

03:04.199 --> 03:06.000
He's recovering

03:06.001 --> 03:08.221
dude can moonwalk!

03:08.222 --> 03:10.168
Now, I'm sure he's almost
through his prescription.

03:10.169 --> 03:11.540
Besides, he's a baby boom.

03:11.541 --> 03:12.577
They invented drugs.

03:12.578 --> 03:14.434
Yeah, they also invented TV.

03:14.435 --> 03:16.170
Have you seen him control one of those?

03:16.171 --> 03:18.135
Intervention. Intervention, intervention.

03:18.136 --> 03:19.793
- Count me out.
- We can't count you out.

03:19.794 --> 03:20.468
He listens to you.

03:20.469 --> 03:22.385
Well, he also listens
to the Barenaked Ladies.

03:22.386 --> 03:24.398
Go get their dumb asses to help you.

03:24.970 --> 03:26.189
- Back it up!
- Okay, Jeff.

03:26.190 --> 03:28.514
You are clearly in a bad space today.

03:28.515 --> 03:30.454
But Pierce is our friend,

03:30.455 --> 03:33.464
and the Barenaked Ladies
are triple platinum... Are you?

03:33.465 --> 03:35.888
Why does everyone leap
to defend that band

03:35.889 --> 03:37.327
so aggressively?

03:37.328 --> 03:39.303
And how much stuff do we have
to go through this year

03:39.304 --> 03:40.867
before my friendship
stops being questioned?

03:40.868 --> 03:42.037
Well, maybe friendship

03:42.038 --> 03:44.314
is about going through
a lot of stuff, Jeff.

03:44.315 --> 03:47.267
And maybe BNL has
two Billboard awards to your zero.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.675
Oh, okay. They're... they're BNL now.

03:49.676 --> 03:52.036
We use shorthand for the Barenaked Ladies.

03:52.037 --> 03:53.585
That's how fundamental they are.

03:53.586 --> 03:54.617
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

03:54.618 --> 03:57.243
You know what Pierce probably
needs more than anything?

03:57.244 --> 03:59.933
Some space. Maybe I do too.

03:59.934 --> 04:02.168
You know what?
Maybe we all need some space

04:02.169 --> 04:03.457
to pull the knife out of the back

04:03.458 --> 04:05.537
of the most celebrated Canadian
alt rock band

04:05.538 --> 04:08.122
of the mid-nineties,
you selfish, jaded ass!

04:08.123 --> 04:10.513
This...is a fight!

04:10.514 --> 04:12.461
We...are fighting!

04:14.634 --> 04:16.062
Jeff. Hello!

04:16.094 --> 04:17.738
I hear you're fighting
with your study group.

04:17.740 --> 04:19.427
- Correct.
- Now, you won't know this,

04:19.428 --> 04:22.330
being American, but tonight
Liverpool are playing...

04:22.331 --> 04:23.674
Manchester United.

04:23.675 --> 04:26.034
I am a stylish American, professor.

04:26.035 --> 04:28.264
I've been forcing myself
to be into soccer since 2004.

04:28.265 --> 04:29.889
Ah! Then it's destiny.

04:29.890 --> 04:33.199
God gave you a British friend
and a massive TV for a reason.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.998
Oh, it's Valentine's Day,
and even though we're fighting,

04:35.999 --> 04:38.158
I did promise the study group
I'd go to the dance...

04:38.159 --> 04:40.009
You promised the study group?
Whip, crack!

04:40.010 --> 04:41.774
I'll see you at precisely 6:30,

04:41.775 --> 04:44.497
or as the English call it,
gravedigger's biscuits.

04:44.498 --> 04:45.389
Okay?

04:53.458 --> 04:56.622
That moonwalk back there
was streets ahead, buddy.

04:56.629 --> 04:57.968
Hey, thanks, buddy.

04:58.263 --> 05:00.738
- Hey, Pierce!
- Hey, it's you!

05:00.894 --> 05:04.368
Yeah. The tiny man you see
when you take enough pills.

05:04.463 --> 05:06.505
We have a good time, don't we, Pierce?

05:06.506 --> 05:08.736
- I ain't hurtin'.
- And you wanna keep this going,

05:08.737 --> 05:10.829
right, 'cause... I'm sure you've noticed

05:10.830 --> 05:12.780
the prescription is almost done.

05:12.781 --> 05:15.057
Ah. Ha. I don't think the doctor...

05:15.058 --> 05:16.789
Doctor, you know, I know he won't...

05:16.790 --> 05:18.981
Pierce, if doctors are so smart,

05:18.982 --> 05:20.829
why are there millions of 'em?

05:22.218 --> 05:23.461
Look in your hand.

05:26.750 --> 05:28.654
It's Valentine's, buddy.

05:29.657 --> 05:30.676
Be mine.

05:35.241 --> 05:36.573
Mariah, my name is Abed Nadir.

05:36.574 --> 05:39.075
- My associate Troy Barnes.
- Charmed, I'm sure.

05:39.167 --> 05:40.486
Are you the guys that keep staring at me

05:40.487 --> 05:42.008
and intermittently yelling out, "books"?

05:42.009 --> 05:43.853
The very same.
We are both interested

05:43.854 --> 05:45.254
in taking you to the Valentine's dance,

05:45.255 --> 05:46.981
but we are also best friends
with each other.

05:46.982 --> 05:49.085
It is of utmost importance
we protect that friendship

05:49.086 --> 05:50.396
from the stresses of courting you,

05:50.397 --> 05:51.538
so we're trying to be as direct

05:51.539 --> 05:52.873
and aboveboard about this as possible.

05:52.874 --> 05:54.276
Will you go to the dance with one of us,

05:54.277 --> 05:56.085
and if so, which one?

05:56.978 --> 05:58.788
We need to get something straight first.

05:59.145 --> 06:01.362
This is the cutest thing
that's ever happened to me.

06:01.906 --> 06:04.825
But...I don't know either one of you.

06:04.826 --> 06:05.933
Give us a moment.

06:08.026 --> 06:09.734
Dude, I need to eat those tacos.

06:10.576 --> 06:12.078
New proposal: Get to know us at the dance

06:12.079 --> 06:14.293
and decide there which
of us you'd like to see again.

06:15.205 --> 06:16.418
Okay. Deal.

06:16.419 --> 06:17.378
Nice.

06:18.322 --> 06:19.542
What's in the briefcase?

06:19.937 --> 06:21.569
Oh. Tacos.

06:22.606 --> 06:23.665
You want one?

06:23.962 --> 06:24.414
No.

06:24.415 --> 06:26.480
Great. We really wanted them.

06:26.481 --> 06:27.863
Yeah. We're gonna eat them.

06:28.636 --> 06:31.712
So like...Would you change
clothes in front of her?

06:31.889 --> 06:34.193
Annie, I know your lack
of world experience

06:34.194 --> 06:36.473
creates curiosity, but questions like that

06:36.474 --> 06:38.448
can make you seem a little bit homophobic.

06:38.449 --> 06:40.032
It's homophobic to ask questions?

06:40.033 --> 06:42.721
If you have to ask
if it's homophobic to ask questions,

06:42.722 --> 06:45.021
haven't you already answered
your own question?

06:45.785 --> 06:46.389
Have I?

06:46.390 --> 06:48.728
Don't know. Not a homophobe.

06:50.518 --> 06:52.471
Oh. There's Page.

06:52.472 --> 06:55.837
Should I ask her 500 questions
about being a lesbian?

06:55.838 --> 06:58.052
Or should I just treat her
like a normal person?

06:58.053 --> 07:00.414
That's a question you can ask.

07:06.491 --> 07:08.096
- Hey.
- Hi.

07:09.955 --> 07:12.021
- I'm not a lesbian.
- Oh!

07:12.460 --> 07:14.052
- I'm not either.
- Oh.

07:14.450 --> 07:16.393
But it's cool that you're friends
with one.

07:16.514 --> 07:17.505
Oh.

07:17.890 --> 07:19.168
Page isn't a lesbian.

07:19.169 --> 07:20.559
She just likes hanging out with Britta,

07:20.560 --> 07:23.114
because it makes her feel cool
to have a lesbian friend.

07:23.367 --> 07:27.022
But...Britta's not a lesbian.
She thinks that Page is.

07:32.104 --> 07:33.492
Guess what, Annie.

07:33.512 --> 07:36.078
Page and I are going
to the dance together.

07:36.079 --> 07:38.529
Hope I stay straight, right?

07:39.987 --> 07:41.887
Oh, sorry. My friend's a tad homophobic,

07:41.888 --> 07:43.429
so I was doing a bit.

07:51.321 --> 07:52.864
Pretty exciting first half.

07:52.865 --> 07:55.119
Yeah, 0-0. Electrifying.

07:55.120 --> 07:57.662
Aw. Worried that your six-headed
ball and chain

07:57.663 --> 07:59.070
will be calling?

07:59.071 --> 08:00.083
Fine.

08:03.167 --> 08:05.786
That's better, you big slut.

08:13.086 --> 08:14.216
It's Chang!

08:14.217 --> 08:15.432
Chang? Why?

08:15.433 --> 08:16.230
I don't know!

08:16.231 --> 08:18.085
I can hear you guys.

08:18.288 --> 08:19.334
What are you doing here, Chang,

08:19.335 --> 08:20.714
and how do you know where I live?

08:20.715 --> 08:22.234
I can answer both of those questions

08:22.235 --> 08:24.464
by returning your driver's license.

08:28.408 --> 08:29.656
Ha!

08:29.657 --> 08:30.704
There it is!

08:30.705 --> 08:32.543
Man U. versus Liverpool!

08:32.544 --> 08:33.851
For God's sake, just let him in.

08:33.852 --> 08:36.500
He's wearing the right colors
and everything.

08:36.866 --> 08:38.804
- Come in.
- Don't mind if I Chang!

08:38.914 --> 08:41.408
Heh heh. Hey, man, check this out.

08:41.409 --> 08:42.475
Ya-haa!

08:43.937 --> 08:46.027
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

08:53.843 --> 08:55.581
Anyway, the thing I was going
to show you guys

08:55.582 --> 08:56.409
is pretty cool.

08:56.410 --> 08:58.306
I'm ignoring you and watching soccer.

08:58.307 --> 08:59.824
Just sit down, Chang.

08:59.825 --> 09:02.229
There's space for three fannies
on this sofa.

09:02.230 --> 09:04.698
Hey. In England,
fanny means vagina, right?

09:04.699 --> 09:07.119
In England, everything means vagina.

09:09.042 --> 09:10.342
I'm gonna make it up to you, Winger.

09:10.343 --> 09:13.572
Even though, like I said,
weird place to put a lamp.

09:13.775 --> 09:16.950
- But let me order a pizza.
- Ooh, I love pizza!

09:16.951 --> 09:19.376
In england we call them Italian fannies.

09:19.377 --> 09:20.581
I'm hookin' us up!

09:21.150 --> 09:22.855
- Cellie...
- Ah. Go use the landline.

09:22.856 --> 09:25.885
Landline? Okay, grandma Bell.

09:28.120 --> 09:30.822
Star-burns, it's Chang.

09:30.980 --> 09:32.639
Remember that pizza you owe me?

09:33.194 --> 09:34.828
Well, it's time to pay up.

09:35.441 --> 09:37.837
Party at Winger's. Tonight.

09:39.103 --> 09:40.500
Yeah, you can tell people.

09:40.732 --> 09:41.995
Cool. Cool.

09:43.138 --> 09:44.770
Hey, uh, wingding at Winger's.

09:46.072 --> 09:47.350
So Mariah, what you get with me

09:47.351 --> 09:48.736
is the complete package...

09:48.737 --> 09:51.152
HBO, Showtime, Starz, Starz black.

09:51.153 --> 09:52.313
Sounds expensive.

09:52.314 --> 09:53.711
With all due respect to my friend here,

09:53.712 --> 09:54.644
if you go with me,

09:54.645 --> 09:56.299
you can expect this on the dance floor.

10:01.302 --> 10:03.233
Go, go, go, go, go.

10:03.234 --> 10:05.519
Go, go, go, go, go!

10:09.099 --> 10:10.880
I feel like everyone's staring.

10:10.935 --> 10:11.704
Not that I care.

10:11.705 --> 10:13.761
Well, of course they're staring.

10:13.762 --> 10:14.720
They've probably never seen

10:14.721 --> 10:17.896
a straight girl and a lesbian
so comfortable together.

10:17.897 --> 10:19.177
Exactly.

10:20.657 --> 10:22.142
Those two were talking about us.

10:22.641 --> 10:25.046
Well, let's give them something
to really talk about.

10:26.370 --> 10:27.958
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

10:31.490 --> 10:32.566
- 'Scuse us.
- Hi.

10:32.567 --> 10:33.603
Hi. Sorry.

10:43.425 --> 10:44.924
Cool music, huh?

10:49.609 --> 10:51.266
Oh, nice call, ref!

10:51.267 --> 10:52.578
Bite my banger!

10:52.579 --> 10:55.607
Jeff, something's up
with your toothbrush, man.

10:55.608 --> 10:57.744
- What the hell?
- I had to get cleaned up.

10:57.745 --> 10:58.780
Why?

11:00.662 --> 11:02.239
Oh, yeah!

11:03.308 --> 11:04.548
Pizza time!

11:04.549 --> 11:06.776
- Leonard?
- Where are the white women at?

11:06.777 --> 11:08.511
No. There are no white
women here, Leonard.

11:08.512 --> 11:09.961
This is not a party!

11:09.962 --> 11:11.905
Don't tell that to Magnitude.

11:11.906 --> 11:13.133
Who's Magnitude?

11:13.134 --> 11:14.946
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

11:14.947 --> 11:15.990
Pop, pop!

11:15.991 --> 11:17.274
Pop, pop!

11:17.797 --> 11:18.882
Bam!

11:19.102 --> 11:20.142
Bam!

11:20.143 --> 11:22.051
Come on in. What's up, what's up?

11:22.052 --> 11:24.572
What's up? Looking good, looking good.

11:24.887 --> 11:27.619
That's my analysis of
the Saw movie franchise.

11:28.295 --> 11:29.186
That about does it,

11:29.187 --> 11:31.030
so I think it's time for you to choose.

11:35.008 --> 11:36.823
Abed, could you get us some punch?

11:36.824 --> 11:37.796
On it.

11:40.009 --> 11:41.708
You guys are really cute together.

11:42.616 --> 11:43.120
Thank you.

11:43.121 --> 11:45.578
But you know, having to...

11:45.870 --> 11:47.066
Actually choose, I...

11:47.067 --> 11:49.180
Hey. We both agreed to this.

11:49.181 --> 11:50.775
We're both very comfortable
with each other,

11:50.776 --> 11:52.713
- so I won't be...
- No. I choose you, Troy.

11:54.927 --> 11:55.829
Punch.

11:56.905 --> 11:58.544
- Hey, Abed.
- Hey.

11:58.689 --> 11:59.716
I, um...

11:59.793 --> 12:02.436
She...Just... She chose me.

12:04.001 --> 12:06.172
Cool. You can have this then.

12:06.376 --> 12:08.190
Thank you, Mariah. Have a great night.

12:16.286 --> 12:17.346
That's great!

12:17.669 --> 12:18.612
Pierce?

12:18.613 --> 12:20.282
You go straight to hell!

12:20.676 --> 12:21.649
Wh...

12:22.684 --> 12:23.559
Ha...

12:23.709 --> 12:24.635
Oh, I'm sorry, Annie.

12:24.636 --> 12:26.495
I...I've been... I don't know.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.879
I've been going through
all these mood swings lately.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.926
You understand we care about you, right?

12:31.787 --> 12:32.688
Okay?

12:33.346 --> 12:34.294
Okay.

12:36.481 --> 12:37.482
Well, look.

12:37.483 --> 12:38.706
Here's the deal.

12:38.707 --> 12:41.867
I am not sharing you with them.

12:41.868 --> 12:43.904
So before this goes further,

12:44.546 --> 12:46.799
you have a choice to make, my friend.

12:49.483 --> 12:52.120
Ha ha! Look at the lesbians.

12:55.499 --> 12:56.434
Lesbians!

12:56.435 --> 12:57.718
- Screw you!
- Screw you!

13:02.563 --> 13:03.220
No, no.

13:03.221 --> 13:05.497
- I don't care what they say.
- Oh, I don't either.

13:05.498 --> 13:07.539
I just wish it wasn't
such an issue for them.

13:07.540 --> 13:09.255
Yeah, but that starts with us.

13:10.809 --> 13:12.981
It starts...With us.

13:27.082 --> 13:29.213
- I've never done this before.
- Me neither.

13:29.482 --> 13:30.769
Wait! What?

13:33.651 --> 13:34.653
So...

13:35.642 --> 13:37.550
Curious about one thing.

13:38.335 --> 13:39.874
What was wrong with Abed?

13:39.887 --> 13:42.205
Well, I mean, he did talk
about the Saw movies

13:42.206 --> 13:43.269
for two hours.

13:43.270 --> 13:45.309
Yeah, but there are eight of them,

13:45.310 --> 13:46.858
and they're two hours apiece,

13:46.859 --> 13:48.865
and the first one did redefine
the genre, and...

13:48.866 --> 13:51.362
Troy, I would love to be his friend.

13:51.363 --> 13:52.720
I know you would. It's incredible.

13:52.721 --> 13:54.822
But romantically, he's...

13:56.407 --> 13:58.003
You know.

14:00.010 --> 14:02.450
I hate her, I hate her, I hate her,
I hate her!

14:04.075 --> 14:06.328
- What happened?
- She called you weird!

14:06.714 --> 14:08.480
- I am weird.
- Not as weird as her!

14:08.481 --> 14:10.477
Who the hell is Nicholas Nickleby?

14:10.530 --> 14:12.474
She wouldn't shut up about it.

14:12.475 --> 14:13.680
Mm. I know.

14:16.059 --> 14:17.647
There's someone out there for us.

14:19.665 --> 14:20.929
Happy Valentine's Day.

14:21.650 --> 14:22.710
It is now.

14:31.395 --> 14:33.159
- Ignore her.
- Okay.

14:36.868 --> 14:38.472
It's weird, but I've never heard
of Magnitude

14:38.473 --> 14:39.680
before tonight.

14:39.681 --> 14:41.602
He's a one-man party!

14:41.863 --> 14:43.724
You're always busy with your study group.

14:43.725 --> 14:45.388
Well, he's not with them tonight.

14:45.389 --> 14:47.608
Oh, yeah!

14:47.836 --> 14:49.401
I thought you quit drinking, Duncan.

14:49.402 --> 14:50.879
False alarm on that one.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.421
Oh, yeah!

14:52.809 --> 14:53.882
Pop, pop!

14:53.883 --> 14:55.899
Ha ho! Pop, pop!

14:55.900 --> 15:00.750
- Pop pop pop pop pop pop!
- Pop pop pop pop pop pop!

15:03.403 --> 15:04.941
I never said I was a lesbian.

15:04.942 --> 15:06.673
Why didn't you just ask me?

15:06.674 --> 15:08.610
Oh, what am I, a homophobe?

15:08.611 --> 15:10.360
I don't care about people's preferences.

15:10.361 --> 15:11.549
You so care.

15:11.550 --> 15:13.429
You are clearly just hanging out with me

15:13.430 --> 15:14.881
because you thought I was gay.

15:14.882 --> 15:17.149
So? What were you doing with me?

15:17.945 --> 15:19.354
Hey, what does it matter, you know?

15:19.355 --> 15:20.507
We're both just humans

15:20.508 --> 15:22.839
trying to make our way through
this crazy world.

15:23.214 --> 15:24.394
You're the worst!

15:24.395 --> 15:26.201
- What?
- And for the record,

15:26.202 --> 15:27.682
I never thought you were cool.

15:27.683 --> 15:29.757
I only thought you were a lesbian.

15:38.355 --> 15:39.560
Page is straight.

15:40.924 --> 15:41.895
Really?

15:43.256 --> 15:44.239
Well...

15:44.627 --> 15:45.814
When she was gay

15:46.370 --> 15:48.784
I thought it was really cool of you
to make out with her.

15:49.659 --> 15:51.038
Thanks, Annie.

15:53.038 --> 15:54.362
Kiss!

15:56.293 --> 15:57.249
Annie!

16:03.148 --> 16:05.085
Oh, thanks, man. Just leave those.

16:05.086 --> 16:07.410
- I'll get them in the morning.
- It's okay.

16:09.586 --> 16:10.927
Are you wearing my underwear?

16:11.198 --> 16:13.841
Oh. I just needed a pair while
I did some laundry here.

16:14.085 --> 16:15.528
I don't have a washing machine.

16:17.885 --> 16:19.041
What the hell?

16:19.075 --> 16:21.270
Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't get mad,
don't get mad!

16:23.224 --> 16:25.275
I'm homeless, Jeff, okay?

16:25.392 --> 16:26.831
When my wife found out
about Shirley and me,

16:26.832 --> 16:28.998
she kicked me out...
For good this time!

16:29.050 --> 16:32.164
My whole life is in this dishwasher, man!

16:32.642 --> 16:35.042
Well, some of it's also soaking
in your bathtub.

16:37.118 --> 16:37.569
Oh...

16:37.570 --> 16:39.436
So wasted and sleepy.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.857
I could probably just crash here
and, you know,

16:41.858 --> 16:44.302
I can start looking for a place
in the morning.

16:46.016 --> 16:48.873
What... You orchestrated
this entire party

16:48.874 --> 16:51.055
just so you could weasel
your way into staying here!

16:51.056 --> 16:52.237
You weren't even going to notice.

16:52.238 --> 16:53.733
Hey, Jeff, don't kill the messenger,

16:53.734 --> 16:56.731
but you have four hermit crabs
in your bathroom sink.

16:57.388 --> 16:59.637
You'll fall in love with them.
I named one Jeff.

16:59.638 --> 17:01.570
How long did you actually think
you were gonna stay here?

17:01.571 --> 17:04.679
Just a month. Three...Tops.

17:04.892 --> 17:07.088
I mean... how long is your lease?

17:16.330 --> 17:17.959
Way to go, idiots!

17:21.930 --> 17:23.992
All right, everybody out.

17:23.993 --> 17:25.111
I'm not kidding.

17:25.796 --> 17:27.001
It's been very interesting

17:27.002 --> 17:30.379
getting to know you all much, much better.

17:30.610 --> 17:33.067
Star-burns, Leonard, Magnitude.

17:33.068 --> 17:34.111
Pop, pop

17:34.531 --> 17:37.887
swizzle, scandalous, C Dubb, Tim.

17:37.954 --> 17:39.916
Mighty D. Glisten.

17:39.917 --> 17:41.592
Good night, everyone. Faster. Move it.

17:41.593 --> 17:42.557
Thank you.

17:43.472 --> 17:44.429
Well...

17:44.641 --> 17:46.653
I hope you found tonight therapeutic,

17:46.654 --> 17:49.458
because I would love to pretend
that that was my plan.

17:50.396 --> 17:51.364
Well, I actually started to have fun

17:51.365 --> 17:53.687
until that maniac tried to move in.

17:53.885 --> 17:57.065
What is it about me that makes
broken people flock to me?

17:57.206 --> 17:58.393
Is it my height?

17:58.500 --> 18:01.151
Do huddled masses mistake me
for the Statue of Liberty?

18:01.152 --> 18:02.094
I don't know.

18:02.095 --> 18:03.975
But being as how you're halfway through

18:03.976 --> 18:06.548
your second year at Greendale,
you may want to

18:06.549 --> 18:08.265
either stop resisting

18:08.679 --> 18:11.203
or admit that you're actually
starting to enjoy it.

18:11.204 --> 18:12.744
Well, you assume I enjoy it

18:12.745 --> 18:14.840
because you think you'd enjoy it.

18:14.841 --> 18:17.622
That's true. I am very lonely.

18:20.689 --> 18:23.001
You want a, uh, nice little taste

18:23.002 --> 18:24.648
of what you're missing in a relationship

18:24.649 --> 18:25.903
with six nutcases?

18:25.904 --> 18:27.903
- Yeah!
- Let's turn on my phone

18:27.904 --> 18:29.472
and listen to the 39 messages

18:29.473 --> 18:30.916
they left tonight.

18:31.506 --> 18:34.167
You have no new messages.

18:35.899 --> 18:38.135
Huh. That's...

18:39.571 --> 18:40.503
Huh.

18:41.266 --> 18:42.579
Since you've got it turned on,

18:42.580 --> 18:44.870
why don't you call me a cab
and then pay for it?

18:45.193 --> 18:46.823
Must have been some kind of trouble.

18:47.721 --> 18:48.722
Ah...

18:49.239 --> 18:50.955
What a relief that would be.

18:52.855 --> 18:54.023
Tell you what, if you need me,

18:54.024 --> 18:56.356
I'm gonna be waiting for my cab down here.

18:57.985 --> 18:59.492
Having a special nap.

19:10.666 --> 19:11.631
Oh!

19:27.367 --> 19:29.279
Thanks, bro. I'll be gone in the morning.

19:29.695 --> 19:31.282
Yeah. Whatever.

19:31.283 --> 19:33.384
Okay. Maybe I stay a while.

19:36.423 --> 19:38.699
- Thirsty.
- Don't push it.

19:38.967 --> 19:39.946
All right...

19:40.807 --> 19:43.161
It might not shock you guys
to hear the real reason

19:43.162 --> 19:44.738
we had a fight today...

19:46.089 --> 19:47.954
It wasn't about the Barenaked Ladies.

19:47.955 --> 19:50.338
Although I do have some
unresolved issues there.

19:51.097 --> 19:53.537
Caring about a person can be scary.

19:53.709 --> 19:57.520
Caring about six people can be
a horrifying embarrassing nightmare.

19:57.521 --> 19:58.743
At least for me.

19:59.418 --> 20:00.931
But if I can't say it today,

20:00.932 --> 20:02.473
when can I say it?

20:03.317 --> 20:04.690
I love you, guys.

20:05.384 --> 20:06.879
Oh, and, Pierce...

20:06.880 --> 20:08.385
Take it from an expert...

20:08.501 --> 20:11.057
These knuckleheads
are right outside your heart.

20:11.401 --> 20:12.721
Let them in.

20:13.469 --> 20:14.769
Before it's too late.

20:16.594 --> 20:18.024
Happy Valentine's Day.

20:25.067 --> 20:27.270
- Be mine?
- Right! Yes!

20:31.796 --> 20:33.494
- Love you.
- Amazing!

20:38.762 --> 20:39.754
You're cute?

20:40.722 --> 20:41.696
No, wait.

20:43.876 --> 20:46.226
- Kiss me.
- There has got to be a way

20:46.227 --> 20:48.188
to make money off of this!

20:51.826 --> 20:52.885
I've been cheating.

20:56.592 --> 20:59.203
No. It says email me.
