Ooh!

00:25.726 --> 00:27.261
- Mommy!
- Aaaaaaah!

00:27.327 --> 00:29.429
- Duncan!
- Duncan!

00:35.202 --> 00:37.337
You're strong, Daddy.
Break it!

00:37.371 --> 00:39.072
Oh, no.
That's just a gimmick

00:39.106 --> 00:40.440
to get suckers worked up

00:40.507 --> 00:42.342
so they buy a phone case
they don't need.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.944
If you can break it,
it's free.

00:43.977 --> 00:44.945
Gimme!

00:45.012 --> 00:46.380
Why won't you break?!

00:46.446 --> 00:48.382
I! Want! You!

00:48.448 --> 00:49.616
So! Bad!

00:49.683 --> 00:51.418
Ah, this could be a while.

00:51.485 --> 00:54.555
They actually let you camp out
in the store for three weeks?

00:54.621 --> 00:56.390
Well, I had to do
a little light vacuuming

00:56.456 --> 00:58.492
and help steal customer
data, but I'm first

00:58.559 --> 01:01.361
in line for the Distractor 12,
the last smartphone

01:01.428 --> 01:03.096
I'll ever need
for the next six months.

01:03.096 --> 01:05.399
I heard it has a new
texting and driving feature

01:05.499 --> 01:07.367
where the phone drives
while you text.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.802
I heard it lets you
talk to the dead.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.537
First of all,
I'm excited to say

01:10.604 --> 01:12.906
we received enough
phones for all of you.

01:12.940 --> 01:13.941
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

01:13.974 --> 01:15.375
I'm even more excited

01:15.442 --> 01:17.878
to announce that we sold
all but one to Russian bots!

01:17.945 --> 01:19.980
- Da!
- Boo!

01:20.047 --> 01:21.515
This is an outrage!

01:21.582 --> 01:23.250
I've been standing
next to a lady who peed

01:23.283 --> 01:24.618
in a bucket for three weeks!

01:24.651 --> 01:27.554
Hey, a little respect.
I'm still your mayor!

01:27.621 --> 01:30.257
To make this experience
even more annoying,

01:30.324 --> 01:31.859
we're randomly
sending out a code

01:31.925 --> 01:36.296
to one customer in line who will
receive the last Distractor 12.

01:36.363 --> 01:38.031
Bex,
you're a religious freak.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.867
Hit up your boy God for me!

01:39.933 --> 01:41.335
Almighty Lord,

01:41.368 --> 01:47.074
deliver thy pin code unto
Yangzi who art in line.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.475
I got it!

01:48.542 --> 01:49.877
I got the Distractor!

01:49.943 --> 01:51.478
I'm better than all y'all!

01:51.512 --> 01:53.747
- Aw!
- Congratulations, Yangzi!

01:53.780 --> 01:56.450
I know how much you wanted this.
- Yeah, dude, whatever.

01:56.517 --> 01:59.353
Wait.
I wasted a miracle on that?

01:59.386 --> 02:02.489
My youth pastor's
in the hospital!

02:03.323 --> 02:04.258
Aaaah!

02:04.291 --> 02:06.660
No mercy, Jing!
No mercy!

02:06.693 --> 02:08.095
Mom, look!

02:08.128 --> 02:09.763
Pop Sockets, Pop Sockets,
Pop Sockets!

02:09.830 --> 02:11.298
Sock puppets?
What are you saying?

02:11.331 --> 02:12.766
Slow down.
- A Pop Socket

02:12.833 --> 02:14.501
is an amazing invention
that helps you

02:14.568 --> 02:17.004
hold your phone for hours, even
after carpal tunnel sets in.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.338
I need one or I'll die!

02:18.372 --> 02:20.140
- Okay, get one.
- You're amazing.

02:20.174 --> 02:22.142
I love you forever. Thanks.

02:22.209 --> 02:23.744
No, I mean you pay for it.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.013
I hate you!
You make me sick!

02:26.046 --> 02:27.581
Hey! Enough, damn it.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.484
You want this damn crap, then
you need to get a damn job.

02:30.517 --> 02:32.853
That's right, I've been
binging old episodes

02:32.920 --> 02:34.354
of Bernie Mac again.

02:34.388 --> 02:37.524
America, I'm sick and tired
of these damn kids.

02:37.591 --> 02:40.260
If Kimberly keeps talking
about Pop Sockets,

02:40.327 --> 02:42.462
she's gonna get
popped in her socket.

02:42.529 --> 02:44.665
When I was your age,
I babysat all the time.

02:44.731 --> 02:48.268
I even made enough money to
buy a VHS tape of "No Way Out"

02:48.335 --> 02:51.572
starring Kevin Costner. Rrrrllll...

02:51.605 --> 02:53.307
Can't I get a job
more in my skill set,

02:53.340 --> 02:55.175
like guessing which pills
middle-aged women are on?

02:55.242 --> 02:57.277
You're babysitting,
and that is final.

02:57.344 --> 03:00.147
Geez, take your
benzos and estrogen.

03:00.214 --> 03:01.715
Benzos and estrogen?

03:01.782 --> 03:06.820
I'm gonna bend-zos kids over
and whip their ass-trogens.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.323
Quit it!
Kimberly, you psycho!

03:11.491 --> 03:14.228
Mom, Kimberly stuck her
Cinnabon in my hair!

03:14.261 --> 03:18.165
I'm acting out 'cause I don't
want to be a stupid babysitter!

03:18.265 --> 03:19.967
Duncan, just eat around it.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.403
I'm trying!

03:23.470 --> 03:25.639
Why does this always happen
on Sugar for Dinner night?

03:25.706 --> 03:29.910
Just plant 'em in front
of the TV and let 'em crash.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.144
- Hmm.
- Hi, Bradley.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.746
I shot a flamethrower today!

03:32.813 --> 03:35.115
I'm pwanting
an organic garden.

03:35.148 --> 03:36.783
- Hey, Patricia.
- Hello, Annie.

03:36.850 --> 03:39.186
Kids, huh?
- I know, we mom so hard,

03:39.219 --> 03:41.355
don't we, girl?
Welp, it's wine o'clock.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.222
Bye! Ha ha!

03:42.289 --> 03:46.560
Ha ha. It's 4:00, girl.

03:46.660 --> 03:47.861
<i>And check this out.</i>

03:47.928 --> 03:50.230
The Distractor 12
takes reverse selfies!

03:50.264 --> 03:52.099
Ba-lam!
Back of my head!

03:52.132 --> 03:53.400
How did it do that?

03:53.467 --> 03:55.869
Who cares?
Blam! CAT scan app!

03:55.936 --> 03:58.605
Damn, dude!
Your rotator cuff is shot!

03:58.672 --> 04:00.741
Who cares? I live so close
to the cell tower,

04:00.807 --> 04:02.809
my internal organs are
probably like fried chicken,

04:02.910 --> 04:06.113
but the signal's so good, I get
breaking WorldStar headlines.

04:06.146 --> 04:07.447
So? We all do.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.416
From tomorrow!

04:09.449 --> 04:10.617
all: Whoa!

04:10.684 --> 04:11.618
Damn!

04:11.718 --> 04:14.354
Dr. Fauci and Lizzo
announced they're dating!

04:14.421 --> 04:15.355
Say what?!

04:15.422 --> 04:16.590
Oh, no!

04:16.657 --> 04:18.125
They just called it quits.

04:18.158 --> 04:20.994
I thought Fizzo was forever.
I'm out.

04:21.028 --> 04:23.397
Hey, this is fun and all,
but it's 2:00 a. m.,

04:23.463 --> 04:25.832
and my mom's upset
we've been shouting "whoa"

04:25.866 --> 04:27.401
and "damn" so much.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.436
Yeah, I have to be up
5:00 a. m.

04:29.503 --> 04:32.472
to make my grandma
hard-boiled eggs. Good night.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.374
Your loss, 'cause
the clicks keep coming.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.076
"Soldier Reunites
With Favorite Stripper.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.911
You'll Cry Your Eyes Out. Like.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.780
"Serial Killer Faints

04:39.813 --> 04:40.948
Like.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.950
"Woman Stabs Sister

04:43.016 --> 04:45.352
Hmm.
Like and share.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.522
Class, you're in for a treat.

04:48.589 --> 04:51.358
I finally completed
my Hamilton-esque musical,

04:51.425 --> 04:52.993
but from England's
point of view.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.695
It's called "George."

04:54.761 --> 04:56.063
♪ I'm George, I'm George ♪

04:56.129 --> 04:57.431

Phone down!

05:04.972 --> 05:06.273
"Man Lucky To Be Alive

Like.
- What the hell?

05:09.543 --> 05:10.944

05:10.944 --> 05:12.613
"Meth Head Dressed As Santa

05:14.248 --> 05:15.048

05:15.082 --> 05:16.950
He just got the Distractor 12.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.619
He's been on it all night.

05:18.652 --> 05:22.723
Yeah, he accidentally sent
me a reverse nude this morning.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.525
Oh, no.
I had to attend a boring

05:24.591 --> 05:27.094
two-hour Zoom
conference about this.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.062
It's called "Scrolliosis."

05:29.129 --> 05:30.264
And it's hella fatal.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.332
Or somethin' bad.

05:32.366 --> 05:33.600
I turned my screen off
to eat cereal.

05:33.634 --> 05:36.103
Bottom line,
he's tweaked out on data,

05:36.136 --> 05:37.771
and I gotta take his phone.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.107
Duncan, Wolf, hold him down.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.109
Bex, put your book bag
over his head.

05:42.176 --> 05:44.077
The rest of you,
sign these NDAs.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.379
Okay, here we go.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.981
Mia, if he kills me,
you're the teacher.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.516
Yes!

05:51.385 --> 05:52.986
Dislike!

05:55.889 --> 05:57.257
Okay, Kimberly.

05:57.324 --> 05:58.659
All great babysitters
have one thing in common.

05:58.725 --> 06:01.261
Their moms are too cheap
to buy them a Pop Socket?

06:01.328 --> 06:02.896
No, they keep the kid alive.

06:02.963 --> 06:06.900
The number one threat
to any child...

06:06.967 --> 06:08.135
the deadly grape.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.570
Goo-goo, ga-ga.

06:09.603 --> 06:12.372
That grape looks too big
for my tiny throat,

06:12.439 --> 06:15.909
but I'm going to pop it
into my mouth anyway.

06:17.411 --> 06:18.545
I'm acting.

06:18.645 --> 06:21.648
Just remain calm,
take off the child's shoe,

06:21.682 --> 06:24.084
and tickle their foot
until they giggle it out.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.586
I'm pretty sure
you do the Heimlich.

06:25.686 --> 06:26.887
We'll see about that.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.989
Doodle-iddle-iddle...
- Ha ha ha ha!

06:31.959 --> 06:34.194
Tickle...feet!

06:34.228 --> 06:36.196
Ticky-tick-tick-ticky...

06:36.230 --> 06:38.699
Ooh--
- Why am I even doing this?

06:38.732 --> 06:40.267
No one's responded to my flyer.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.703
You put up one!
On a bee's nest!

06:42.769 --> 06:44.838
For people
who gather fresh honey.

06:47.708 --> 06:51.245
While gathering fwesh honey
for my herbal tea this morning,

06:51.311 --> 06:54.348
I noticed your advertisement.

06:54.381 --> 06:57.351
We require your services
this evening.

06:57.384 --> 06:59.052
Get out of here,
you little freak!

06:59.119 --> 07:00.587
You need a babysitter?

07:00.654 --> 07:03.757
My pwarents got tickets to
"This American Life on Ice,"

07:03.790 --> 07:07.794
and my regular sitter is
doing her dissertation at MIT.

07:07.828 --> 07:10.464
I don't know what any of
that means, but she'll take it!

07:10.531 --> 07:12.366
Mommy, no!

07:12.399 --> 07:15.302
I spent 36 hours
in labor with that child.

07:15.369 --> 07:18.305
She can spend a couple hours
doing some child labor!

07:18.372 --> 07:20.707
Damn, it's hard coming up
with these turns of phrase!

07:20.741 --> 07:24.378
Hey! I used to be able to
smoke these on this network!

07:24.411 --> 07:27.581
That's some bull,
Fox Standards!

07:31.451 --> 07:33.353
Okay, Kimberly,
we just have a few

07:33.387 --> 07:35.389
healthy boundaries
for Bradley.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.458
No screens, no sugar, no games
with chutes and/or ladders,

07:38.492 --> 07:41.161
no music after 1930,
and make sure

07:41.195 --> 07:43.730
he takes his
Mare of Easttown Vitamins.

07:44.231 --> 07:47.234
I like to eat
the ponytail first.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.069
I promise Bradley
will get my full attention.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.470
What's your Wi-Fi password?

07:50.571 --> 07:51.572
Oh, we don't have Wi-Fi.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.440
It turns your insides
to fried chicken.

07:53.540 --> 07:54.641
Come on, honey.

07:54.675 --> 07:57.144
I want to see Ira Glass
lace up his skates.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.347
Bonsoir, Patwicia.

08:00.380 --> 08:01.949
So what do we do

08:01.982 --> 08:03.016
for the next three hours?

08:03.116 --> 08:04.351
Play peek-a-boo or some crap?

08:04.418 --> 08:05.485
Heavens no.

08:05.552 --> 08:06.620
I have a snack--

08:06.653 --> 08:08.856
one gwape, cut safely
in half lengthwise,

08:08.922 --> 08:12.025
then tuck myself in
to read Dostoevsky.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.527
Good night.

08:13.594 --> 08:16.330
Wow, a whole night
to myself with...

08:17.364 --> 08:18.498
No Wi-Fi!

08:18.532 --> 08:22.636
Well, I do have a lot
of homework to do.

08:22.669 --> 08:26.406
"It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times."

08:26.473 --> 08:28.008
God, pick a lane.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.042
Screw this.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.944
I'm gonna snoop.

08:31.612 --> 08:35.315
ED? I thought her
husband's name was Tom.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.019
Oh, my God, it's huge!

08:39.086 --> 08:41.221
Who needs a tote bag this big?

08:41.255 --> 08:43.223
And why do they keep it
in their nightstand?

08:43.257 --> 08:46.126
Ugh!
This place is so boring.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.428
Huh? Oh, that's right.

08:48.462 --> 08:49.730
She's a therapist!

08:49.796 --> 08:53.534
Straitjackets and people's
private pain--yes, please.

08:58.472 --> 09:02.176
Wow.
The air is salty with tears.

09:03.410 --> 09:04.611
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.847
Of course, I'll have
to report what you told me

09:06.914 --> 09:07.981
to the authorities.

09:08.015 --> 09:08.982
Whee!

09:10.050 --> 09:11.685
Her secret files!

09:11.718 --> 09:13.053
Ugh.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.721
Eee!

09:16.423 --> 09:18.292
<i>No! No!</i>

09:18.358 --> 09:19.793
I'm not addicted to my phone.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.862
I just need something to keep
my hands busy at parties.

09:21.929 --> 09:22.863
Come on, guys.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.431
It's your boy!

09:24.498 --> 09:27.100
It's just an overnight
detox, dude.

09:27.134 --> 09:29.136
Your phone is killing you.

09:29.203 --> 09:30.871
And you're annoying
the hell out of us!

09:30.904 --> 09:34.174
Just let me see how Jason
Derulo's vacation is going.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.742
He needs engagement!

09:39.179 --> 09:41.315
He's Hulking the duct tape!

09:41.348 --> 09:42.316
Run!

09:42.349 --> 09:43.383
Aah!

09:44.952 --> 09:46.920
<i>Jason Derulo!</i>

09:46.987 --> 09:48.322
Ugh.
That is it.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.924
I am putting him
out of his misery.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.292
- Bex, no!
- What?

09:52.392 --> 09:54.962
I'd want you to
bash my brains in.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.830
I love babysitting!

09:56.864 --> 09:58.498
Home invasion!
Aah!

09:58.565 --> 09:59.566
I knew you'd love it!

09:59.600 --> 10:00.767
So what did you like most?

10:00.801 --> 10:03.237
A parent's trust?
A child's hug?

10:03.303 --> 10:05.239
Rubbing your bare feet
all over their carpet?

10:05.272 --> 10:07.174
That was always my favorite.
- I liked the part

10:07.241 --> 10:08.509
where I got the money
and it was over.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.444
They're even having me
back tomorrow night!

10:10.477 --> 10:13.247
More importantly, I learned so
much, like why Helen Diggins

10:13.280 --> 10:14.748
always smells like bananas.

10:14.781 --> 10:18.185
It's because she likes to
smear them all over her body!

10:18.218 --> 10:20.320
Gross!
And how do you know this?

10:20.354 --> 10:22.122
Patricia
is Helen's therapist.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.991
It was in her secret file.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.392
Kimberly,
you're in a position of trust.

10:25.492 --> 10:27.294
You're not supposed
to be snooping.

10:27.361 --> 10:28.896
So, you don't want to hear

10:28.929 --> 10:32.099
what Old Man Johnson can't stop
doing in a public bathroom?

10:32.132 --> 10:34.201
Let me get some wine.

10:34.234 --> 10:37.137
Aw, it's so sad that
Mr. Mitch never got

10:37.237 --> 10:38.739
the approval of Mee-maw Mitch.

10:38.772 --> 10:42.442
Here's one that'll pick us
up, "Mayor Jen's Hit and Run."

10:42.509 --> 10:44.244
Ooh.
"Annie Harris!"

10:44.311 --> 10:46.380
Let's see what this
psycho's up to!

10:46.413 --> 10:48.382
I'm not a patient
of Patricia's.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.984
"Annie Harris
is not my patient--"

10:51.051 --> 10:52.819
- See?
- "But she should be."

10:52.853 --> 10:55.189
Oh, why do I always
jump in so fast?

10:55.255 --> 10:57.424
"She parents her
children with TV,

10:57.491 --> 11:00.861
sugar, and unfettered access
to flamethrowers."

11:00.928 --> 11:02.296
One time!

11:02.362 --> 11:04.998
"She stresses out her
poor husband so much,

11:05.032 --> 11:07.601
"I once saw him eat
an entire sheet cake,

11:07.668 --> 11:10.437
"crouched in the bushes,
singing 'happy birthday to me,'

11:10.504 --> 11:11.538
while weeping."

11:11.572 --> 11:12.806
Candles and all.

11:12.873 --> 11:16.410
But it's not your fault.
I'm just powerless over cake.

11:16.476 --> 11:19.046
She's blaming me
for everything.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.014
I'm a damn fine matriarch.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.616
Cheers to that!

11:22.683 --> 11:23.350
Ah!

11:23.383 --> 11:25.419
Nobody judges my mom but me!

11:25.452 --> 11:27.521
No way I'm babysitting
for her tomorrow.

11:27.588 --> 11:29.056
Oh, yes, you are!

11:29.122 --> 11:30.991
Because
we're the bigger people.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.826
Right, honey?
- Hell no!

11:32.893 --> 11:34.461
While she's
babysitting, we're gonna

11:34.494 --> 11:38.198
snoop the crap out of Patricia's
house to get dirt on her.

11:38.232 --> 11:39.933
Don't you want to hear
about Coach Walters'

11:40.000 --> 11:41.869
alternate personality Kirk?

11:41.935 --> 11:43.804
Coach Walters is Kirk?

11:47.074 --> 11:49.076
He's not yelling anymore.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.678
Yo, Yangzi!
You dead?

11:55.449 --> 11:58.819
How long was I running
full-speed into the door?

11:58.886 --> 11:59.953
About 12 hours.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.255
Ah! What is that

12:01.288 --> 12:04.057
that giant fiery
ring light in the sky?

12:04.124 --> 12:05.325
Are you talking about
the sun?

12:05.392 --> 12:07.694
Wow.
Has that always been there?

12:07.728 --> 12:10.097
Whoa!
A flying emoji!

12:10.130 --> 12:11.498
No, that's just a butterfly.

12:11.565 --> 12:14.801
How did I not notice all
this dope stuff before?

12:14.902 --> 12:16.570
Because you were
too busy following

12:16.637 --> 12:19.206
the Twitter fight between Olivia
Rodrigo and Oscar the Grouch.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.874
He called her trash
and she didn't

12:20.941 --> 12:22.176
realize it was a compliment.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.311
Welp, I got bit by
a weird bug out here

12:24.344 --> 12:27.247
and I can't feel my leg,
so I'm going to urgent care.

12:27.281 --> 12:28.482
Later!

12:28.515 --> 12:31.618
- Super proud of you, Yangzi.
- See?

12:31.652 --> 12:34.488
I told you that serious
addiction is not that serious.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.323
All right, I'm just
gonna stay here and marvel

12:36.390 --> 12:38.158
at all the wonders around me!

12:38.258 --> 12:40.827
Real life is my
social media now.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.332
Hello, little emoji.

12:45.399 --> 12:46.667
I like you.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.669
Like, like...

12:48.702 --> 12:50.571
Like. Like.
Like. Like.

12:50.637 --> 12:53.407
Likelikelikelikelike.

12:56.243 --> 12:58.245
Okay. Bradley
made his chamomile tea,

12:58.312 --> 13:00.280
read me his one-act play,
and put himself to bed.

13:00.347 --> 13:01.882
Let's do some snooping.

13:01.949 --> 13:04.418
Annie, I'm not really
on board with this.

13:04.518 --> 13:07.955
Jack, this woman accused me
of ruining my family's life

13:07.988 --> 13:09.489
with my poor choices!

13:09.523 --> 13:12.359
Now help me ransack her
house, Jing's home alone.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.561
I turned on the stove
all by myself!

13:14.628 --> 13:16.330
I told you, I've already
been through this place.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.764
You're not gonna find anything.

13:17.831 --> 13:19.399
That's 'cause
you're an amateur!

13:19.466 --> 13:22.236
When I was babysitting,
I was the queen of snooping.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.805
I found Polaroids
in a bag of frozen peas

13:24.872 --> 13:25.939
that ended a marriage!

13:25.973 --> 13:27.241
Jack, pull up the carpet!

13:27.274 --> 13:29.209
Kimberly, those books
might be hollow!

13:29.243 --> 13:30.811
Crack one open
for once in your life!

13:30.844 --> 13:32.813
Jeez, Mom, you don't
have to get mean.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.147
Sorry, sorry!

13:34.214 --> 13:35.482
My heart is racing!

13:35.516 --> 13:37.584
Guys, I found something
under the carpet!

13:37.651 --> 13:39.286
Original hardwood floors!

13:39.353 --> 13:40.854
These are gorg!
What were they thinking?

13:40.921 --> 13:42.556
Why don't you go
home and watch Jing?

13:42.623 --> 13:46.460
My imaginary friend dared
me to jump from this window!

13:46.527 --> 13:48.562
Yep, yep, yep.

13:52.633 --> 13:54.501
There's gotta be an
ex-husband's corpse

13:54.568 --> 13:55.636
in these walls.

13:55.702 --> 13:57.838
Kimberly, use your little
hands and feel around.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.940
What are you doing?

14:01.308 --> 14:05.679
Kimberwy, Annie,
you twashed my house.

14:05.746 --> 14:09.016
America, I should have
bought her the damn Pop Socket.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.350
Or the damn sock puppet.

14:10.384 --> 14:12.319
Whatever the damn
thing's called.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.155
Sorry about all
the language tonight.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.694
Bradley, I'm begging you,
as your babysitter,

14:20.727 --> 14:22.095
don't tell your mom about this.

14:22.129 --> 14:23.297
Think of all the fun
we had together.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.998
Remember when I
let you go to bed?

14:25.032 --> 14:26.200
That was fun.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.202
Okay, my wips are sealed.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.771
For a pwice.

14:30.838 --> 14:32.739
There's one thing
I always dweam of doing,

14:32.773 --> 14:37.945
but mother always says no--late
night bweakfast at Danny's.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.947
Danny's? You mean that
Denny's type restaurant

14:39.980 --> 14:41.348
that's called Danny's?

14:41.381 --> 14:44.384
Late night at Danny's
is no place for a child!

14:44.451 --> 14:48.455
I want to experience the freak
show that is the weal America.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.191
And also try the
Choconana waffles.

14:51.258 --> 14:54.828
Or I tell mother
you ransacked our house.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.163
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

14:56.230 --> 14:58.198
Danny's, freaks,
waffles, and then home!

14:58.232 --> 15:01.435
Smart girl.

15:02.236 --> 15:03.070
Swish!

15:03.070 --> 15:04.905
Hey, yo, D. Check it out.

15:04.972 --> 15:07.574
I call it, Latte Registration.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.543
That's crazy.
That's crazy.

15:09.610 --> 15:11.345
Oh, Kanye. Ha. Cool.

15:11.378 --> 15:13.313
- Do you like it?
- It's cool.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.749
- Yeah, but do you like it?
- It's cool.

15:15.816 --> 15:18.619
Yeah.
But do you like it?!

15:18.685 --> 15:20.721
I like it!
Leave me alone!

15:20.754 --> 15:23.490
Thank you for your
validation!

15:23.557 --> 15:25.192
Support Black women!

15:25.259 --> 15:27.694
Get the hell out of my house!

15:27.761 --> 15:29.496
Yes!

15:31.398 --> 15:32.900
I'm just stopping
by to say don't

15:33.000 --> 15:35.769
let your haters get you down!
- I have haters?

15:35.802 --> 15:39.306
Oh, and could you go tell
some strangers what I just said?

15:39.339 --> 15:42.442
You want me to retweet
you in real life?

15:42.476 --> 15:44.178
And throw this
gif on there too!

15:44.211 --> 15:46.146
Yangzi.

15:46.213 --> 15:50.050
Oh! Print that out for me!

15:51.485 --> 15:54.388
Coming through.
Watch your feet.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.091
Hah! Hah! Hah!

15:58.158 --> 16:01.395
Wow.
It's as horrible as I dweamed.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.131
Okay, Bradley.
Please finish your waffles.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.500
That one-eyed guy
is maddogging me.

16:06.567 --> 16:09.736
And something just
crawled over my foot.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.705
Yup, it's an iguana.

16:11.772 --> 16:12.573
I'm out.

16:12.606 --> 16:16.443
Wait, I--I didn't
try boysenberry!

16:19.246 --> 16:21.181
Stay in school, little man.

16:25.052 --> 16:28.021
Oh, God, an improv
group after their show.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.189
We got out just in time.

16:29.223 --> 16:30.757
- Great yelling tonight!
- Yeah!

16:30.757 --> 16:34.094
Have you ever noticed the louder
we are, the funnier we are?

16:34.161 --> 16:36.363
Okay, Bradley.
Into your car seat.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.899
I've got to get you home
before your mother finds out.

16:38.966 --> 16:41.001
Scwew Patwicia!

16:41.068 --> 16:43.704
I've tasted fweedom and sywup!

16:43.737 --> 16:47.574
I want to listen to explicit
lyrics and stream Euphoria!

16:47.608 --> 16:51.245
My phone!
I'll kill you, you monster!

16:51.311 --> 16:56.116
I bewong to the niiiiight!

16:56.149 --> 16:57.551
That guy is good.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.887
- Aah!
- Ohh!

16:59.953 --> 17:01.421
Hear me, hear me!

17:01.488 --> 17:04.091
Marvel at my
uninformed opinions!

17:04.124 --> 17:06.159
That hat you're wearing, sir?
Mm-mm.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.227
That ain't it, chief!

17:07.294 --> 17:09.863
The salesman said it was it.

17:09.897 --> 17:11.732
Listen, Yangzi,
we're proud of you

17:11.798 --> 17:13.233
for kicking your
online addiction,

17:13.333 --> 17:15.302
but you just transferred it
to real life.

17:15.369 --> 17:17.604
I don't follow.
Follow. Follow.

17:17.638 --> 17:20.007
Yangzi, I'm gonna try
to be nice about this.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.276
You're acting like a psycho
and everyone hates you.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.178
Ah, I see your problem.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.646
You all still have your phones.

17:25.712 --> 17:29.249
You just need to get woke to
the dopeness of real life.

17:29.316 --> 17:33.387
Oh, the whole world does.

17:33.453 --> 17:35.222
Your eyes are
pinwheeling, man.

17:35.255 --> 17:36.490
I'm gonna knock
out that cell tower

17:36.557 --> 17:39.193
and get people off
their phones forever.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.395
♪DepowerTheTower!
Whoo!

17:41.461 --> 17:44.064
Damn it. We have to
follow him, don't we?

17:50.170 --> 17:51.405
Hello, stwange dog.

17:51.471 --> 17:54.174
I'm gonna pet you
and name you Foamy.

17:56.577 --> 17:58.011
Show's over, Stewie!

17:58.078 --> 18:00.013
Hee-yeah!

18:00.080 --> 18:01.748
Let's ride, Foamy!

18:01.815 --> 18:03.383
Ha ha ha ha!

18:03.450 --> 18:06.987
Oh, God,
he's riding a rabid dog.

18:07.087 --> 18:09.690
This is going poorly.

18:13.994 --> 18:16.563
I'm on top of the world!

18:16.663 --> 18:21.535
I'm staying here till my insides
turn to fwied chicken, Mother!

18:21.602 --> 18:23.003
Bradley, is that you?

18:23.070 --> 18:24.204
Yangzi, my word.

18:24.238 --> 18:25.839
What are you doing here?

18:25.906 --> 18:27.741
Destroying the demon
Wi-Fi that traps us

18:27.808 --> 18:29.443
in a technological dystopia.
You?

18:29.510 --> 18:31.845
I'm hopped up on sugar
and acting out.

18:31.912 --> 18:34.615
I'm tired of living
in Patricia's

18:34.681 --> 18:36.016
overpwotective bubble!

18:36.083 --> 18:38.352
Hey, little dude,
that don't look very safe.

18:38.385 --> 18:41.388
Stop twying to control--
uh-oh.

18:41.455 --> 18:44.791
Aaah!
- Oh!

18:44.825 --> 18:46.460
Oh my God!

18:46.493 --> 18:49.229
My phone!
It's gotta be so scared!

18:49.263 --> 18:51.865
Save me, Yangzi! <i>- Save me.</i>

18:51.965 --> 18:55.536
<i>I'll give you precious
likes and follows!</i>

18:55.602 --> 18:58.839
Likes and follows.

18:58.906 --> 19:00.774
Your eyes are weverse
pinwheeling, man.

19:00.807 --> 19:05.179
Don't worry, Bradley.
I'll save your livestream.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.813
Guess who's bizzack?
Ha-ha!

19:06.880 --> 19:09.650
It's ya boy Yangzi, hanging
with my main man Bradley,

19:09.716 --> 19:12.052
who's dangling for his life.
Say what up, B.

19:12.085 --> 19:13.854
Pwease, help me.

19:13.887 --> 19:15.522
As a brave sufferer
of Scrolliosis,

19:15.589 --> 19:18.225
I'm gonna use my remaining
strength to save this child.

19:18.258 --> 19:21.128
So smash that like button!
Here we go!

19:25.132 --> 19:29.169
Ha ha! Ahh...

19:29.236 --> 19:31.605
I'm getting so many likes,
we're floating

19:31.672 --> 19:33.974
to safety on my validation.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.075
- Aah!
- Oh, my God.

19:35.108 --> 19:36.176
They're plummeting!

19:36.243 --> 19:38.912
This is going poorly!

19:38.979 --> 19:43.217
- Aah!
- Aah!

19:43.250 --> 19:45.752
Thanks for calling 9-1-1.

19:45.819 --> 19:47.287
Yeah,
that's what a sane person

19:47.354 --> 19:49.323
does when someone's in trouble.

19:51.091 --> 19:53.560
Oh, thank God.

19:53.627 --> 19:57.030
You see what happens when you
break the healthy boundaries?

19:57.097 --> 19:58.932
This is exactly what
I was afraid of.

19:58.966 --> 20:00.501
I met a biker chick.

20:00.534 --> 20:02.936
You know, I think
what we learned tonight

20:03.003 --> 20:05.906
is that being a mom is hard,
and that's why women

20:05.939 --> 20:07.508
have to support each other.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.810
Get help, you lunatic.

20:09.877 --> 20:11.211
Oh, she's right.

20:11.245 --> 20:13.747
I'm a disaster of a mother.
- Whatever.

20:13.780 --> 20:16.250
You're a hardworking, frazzled,
fun mess who sometimes

20:16.250 --> 20:17.551
gives us donuts for dinner.

20:17.651 --> 20:19.987
And I'm glad 'cause
otherwise, I'd end up

20:20.020 --> 20:21.221
a weirdass kid like Bradley.

20:21.255 --> 20:22.656
Oh, yeah, I mean,
there's gonna

20:22.689 --> 20:24.658
be a disturbing documentary
about him someday.

20:24.725 --> 20:26.593
And I'm gonna tell Patricia
this was all my fault

20:26.693 --> 20:28.462
so she has to apologize to you.

20:28.529 --> 20:29.963
You mom hard, girl.

20:29.997 --> 20:31.565
Also, you're taking me
to the mall tomorrow

20:31.632 --> 20:34.835
and buying me whatever I want.
- Deal.

20:34.868 --> 20:37.171
Well, America,
is Annie Mac perfect?

20:37.237 --> 20:38.572
No.

20:38.605 --> 20:41.375
But as long as my kids love
me, I'm all right with that.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.210
Oh, and I took Kimberly
to the mall.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.112
I didn't buy her jack.

20:45.145 --> 20:46.847
My kids don't tell me
what to do.

20:46.914 --> 20:49.049
And neither do you,
Fox Standards.

20:49.116 --> 20:51.351
I'm smoking this damn thing!

20:51.418 --> 20:52.619
A carrot?!

20:52.686 --> 20:56.023
Which one of you
swapped my cigar for a carrot?

20:59.760 --> 21:01.995
I never thought this whole
ordeal would end with you

21:02.062 --> 21:03.363
being one of my patients.

21:03.430 --> 21:04.831
First day in therapy, people!

21:04.865 --> 21:06.733
She gonna fix my
head up real good.

21:06.767 --> 21:08.502
Mental health is mental wealth!

21:08.569 --> 21:10.470
Sit down and stop
quoting my coasters.

21:10.504 --> 21:12.439
What is meant for you
will not pass you by.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.007
Okay, I'm done.

21:14.074 --> 21:15.576
Save me, Patricia!

21:15.609 --> 21:17.244
I broke into a bakery!

21:17.277 --> 21:20.647
I ruined some poor
couple's wedding!

21:22.482 --> 21:25.519
Just turn a little
more my way.

21:25.586 --> 21:27.621
How's this?
