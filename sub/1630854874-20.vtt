YOU MAY REMEMBER, HE WAS DRUMMED

01:17.747 --> 01:19.313

02:32.355 --> 02:33.221
FACT HE CALLED IT "THE STOLEN

02:33.290 --> 02:34.422

02:34.491 --> 02:35.256
TERM "INTELLECTUAL ARCHITECT"

02:35.325 --> 02:36.991
FOR AN ARGUMENT THAT BASICALLY

02:37.060 --> 02:37.560
AMOUNTED TO "NUH-UH, I'M THE

02:37.627 --> 02:39.694
PRESIDENT."

02:39.763 --> 02:40.294
EVEN SET ASIDE HIS HAIR THERE,

02:40.363 --> 02:43.831

02:43.900 --> 02:44.899
OLDEST T-BIRD IN GREASE APPLYING

02:44.968 --> 02:46.701

02:46.770 --> 02:50.505
STEVE BANNON IS RIGHT.

JOHNSON LED THE AMICUS BRIEF IN

02:51.208 --> 02:52.039

02:52.108 --> 02:55.476
INVALIDATE THE ELECTION IN 2020.

02:55.545 --> 02:57.311

02:57.380 --> 02:58.579

02:58.648 --> 03:00.081

03:04.020 --> 03:05.419

03:07.390 --> 03:08.523

03:08.592 --> 03:08.892
DO YOU --

03:08.959 --> 03:10.024
>> BOOO!

03:10.093 --> 03:13.761
>> SHUT UP!

03:13.830 --> 03:15.663

03:15.732 --> 03:16.032
BUT "BOOOOOOO!

03:16.099 --> 03:17.765
SHUT UP!"

03:17.834 --> 03:20.935
IS NOT "NO."

03:21.004 --> 03:21.869

03:21.938 --> 03:23.237
FOXX THERE, REPEATEDLY YELLING

03:23.306 --> 03:24.572
"SHUT UP" IN THE SAME TONE AS A

03:24.641 --> 03:27.542
DRUNK GRANDMA AT THANKSGIVING

03:27.611 --> 03:28.676
BEING TOLD SHE CAN'T SNEAK THE

03:28.745 --> 03:29.744
DOG ANY MORE TURKEY SKIN.

03:29.813 --> 03:30.611
"SHUT UP!

03:30.680 --> 03:31.479
BOSCO LOVES IT!

03:31.548 --> 03:32.847
HE'S JUST HUNGRY!

03:32.916 --> 03:36.717
SHUT UP!"

03:36.786 --> 03:37.985
AND, IF THERE WAS ANY HOPE

03:38.054 --> 03:38.653
JOHNSON MIGHT MODERATE HIS VIEWS

03:38.722 --> 03:40.054
NOW THAT HE'S SPEAKER, THAT'S

03:40.123 --> 03:41.489
GONE.

03:41.558 --> 03:42.457
LAST WEEK, HE SENT A FUNDRAISING

03:42.526 --> 03:44.025
EMAIL EXPRESSING ALARM THAT HIGH

03:44.094 --> 03:49.266
SCHOOLERS INCREASINGLY

03:52.969 --> 03:53.534
SCHOOLERS INCREASINGLY IDENTIFY

03:53.603 --> 03:55.069
AS LGBTQ, AND ON TUESDAY,

03:55.138 --> 03:55.605
RECEIVED AN AWARD FROM THE

03:55.672 --> 03:57.004
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF

03:57.073 --> 03:57.772

03:59.676 --> 04:01.275
THREE TIMES WORSE THAN SMOKING."

04:01.344 --> 04:03.077
WHICH IS ABSURD.

04:03.146 --> 04:03.678
THE ONLY THING A SMOKING HABIT

04:03.747 --> 04:04.679
AND SOMEONE'S SEXUALITY HAVE IN

04:04.748 --> 04:06.147
COMMON IS THAT THEY COULD BOTH

04:06.216 --> 04:07.548
BE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THIS

04:07.617 --> 04:10.418

04:10.487 --> 04:11.052

04:11.121 --> 04:16.357
TAILORED TIGHT.

04:16.426 --> 04:16.958
HE'S NOT JUST SERVING HUMPS:

04:17.027 --> 04:19.193
HE'S CAUSING THEM.

04:19.262 --> 04:20.027

04:20.096 --> 04:21.195
VETTING BEFORE JOHNSON BECAME

04:21.264 --> 04:22.430
SPEAKER, WE KEEP DISCOVERING NEW

04:22.499 --> 04:24.132
UNSETTLING FACTS ABOUT HIM, LIKE

04:24.201 --> 04:25.166
THAT HE APPARENTLY USES AN APP

04:25.235 --> 04:27.168
THAT ALERTS HIM IF HIS SON LOOKS

04:27.237 --> 04:28.469
AT PORN ONLINE, AND VICE VERSA.

04:28.538 --> 04:31.272
>> IT SCANS ALL THE ACTIVITY ON

04:31.341 --> 04:33.040

04:33.109 --> 04:34.108

04:34.177 --> 04:37.011
YOU: WE DO ALL OF IT.

04:37.080 --> 04:37.547
IT SENDS A REPORT TO YOUR

04:37.614 --> 04:39.814
ACCOUNTABILITY PARTNER.

04:39.883 --> 04:40.681
MY ACCOUNTABILITY PARTNER RIGHT

04:40.750 --> 04:42.183
NOW IS JACK, MY SON.

04:42.252 --> 04:43.084
RIGHT?

04:43.153 --> 04:44.519
HE'S 17.

04:44.588 --> 04:45.753
SO, HE AND I GET A REPORT ABOUT

04:45.822 --> 04:46.921

04:46.990 --> 04:47.555

04:50.193 --> 04:50.758
IF ANYTHING OBJECTIONABLE COMES

04:50.827 --> 04:52.927

04:52.996 --> 04:54.762
GETS AN IMMEDIATE NOTICE.

04:54.831 --> 04:55.930
I'M PROUD TO TELL YOU, MY SON,

04:55.999 --> 04:57.231
HE'S GOT A CLEAN SLATE.

04:57.300 --> 05:00.501
>> John: OKAY.

05:00.570 --> 05:01.037
FIRST, OBVIOUSLY, IF MIKE

05:01.104 --> 05:03.037
JOHNSON'S SON IS WATCHING THIS,

05:03.106 --> 05:04.705
I'M REALLY SORRY.

05:04.774 --> 05:06.541
YOUR DAD SEEMS LIKE A LOT.

05:06.610 --> 05:07.208
AND, IF HE'S WATCHING THIS

05:07.277 --> 05:08.443

05:08.512 --> 05:09.811
PROBABLY IS, TOO.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.546
HI, MIKE!

05:11.615 --> 05:12.180

05:12.249 --> 05:13.748

05:20.590 --> 05:21.155
A REPORT OF HIS DAD'S INTERNET

05:21.224 --> 05:24.559
ACTIVITY, WHICH MIGHT BE WORSE.

05:24.628 --> 05:27.361
NOT JUST BECAUSE IT'S

05:27.430 --> 05:28.396
TRAUMATIZING TO LEARN YOUR DAD

05:28.465 --> 05:29.897
SEARCHED FOR "THE SEX STUFF,

05:29.966 --> 05:36.966
LIGHTS OFF, SHIRTS ON,"

05:37.107 --> 05:39.740
ITS THAT HAVING ACCESS TO YOUR

05:39.809 --> 05:46.809
DAD'S MOM PORN SEARCHES IS --

05:47.017 --> 05:49.050
"SHAMPOO FOR THINNING HAIR,"

05:49.119 --> 05:49.650
"KNEE CLICKING CANCER QUESTION

05:49.719 --> 05:50.685
MARK,"

05:50.754 --> 05:52.220
"IS VIAGRA CHRISTIAN,"

05:52.289 --> 05:52.854
THAT'S A DARK GLIMPSE INTO

05:52.923 --> 05:53.921
TOMORROW NO 17-YEAR-OLD WANTS.

05:53.990 --> 05:55.857
THE APP HE'S TALKING ABOUT IS

05:55.926 --> 05:56.891
CALLED "COVENANT EYES."

05:56.960 --> 05:57.959
AND, IF YOU'RE A COMPANY TRYING

05:58.028 --> 05:58.559
TO STOP PEOPLE FROM CONSTANTLY

05:58.628 --> 05:59.961
THINKING ABOUT SEX, MAYBE DON'T

06:00.030 --> 06:00.728
MAKE YOUR LOGO LOOK LIKE A

06:00.797 --> 06:01.896
TANTALIZING HOLE.

06:01.965 --> 06:03.931
THERE ARE EVEN ADS FOR THE APP,

06:04.000 --> 06:04.999
AND THEY'RE SPECTACULAR.

06:05.068 --> 06:05.800
>> SO, WHAT'S BETTER THAN JUST A

06:05.869 --> 06:06.667
PORN BLOCKER?

06:06.736 --> 06:07.502
USING A PORN BLOCKER WITH

06:07.571 --> 06:10.271
ACCOUNTABILITY.

06:10.340 --> 06:11.172
ACCOUNTABILITY ENABLES A TRUSTED

06:11.241 --> 06:12.507
FRIEND TO SEE HOW YOU'RE USING

06:12.576 --> 06:14.041
YOUR DEVICE.

06:14.110 --> 06:14.642
EVEN IF PORN SLIPS THROUGH THE

06:14.711 --> 06:15.877
CRACKS, SOMEONE ELSE KNOWS AND

06:15.946 --> 06:19.347
CAN HELP YOU GET BACK ON TRACK.

06:19.416 --> 06:20.081
THAT'S SOMETHING PORN BLOCKERS

06:20.150 --> 06:21.949
CAN NEVER DO.

06:22.018 --> 06:23.885
>> John: HOLD ON A SECOND.

06:23.954 --> 06:24.519
ARE WE ABSOLUTELY SURE THIS IS

06:24.588 --> 06:27.088
AN "ANTI-PORN" APP?

06:27.157 --> 06:27.590
BECAUSE, THESE TWO HAVE

06:27.657 --> 06:30.158
DEFINITELY FUCKED.

06:30.227 --> 06:30.360
"HEY!

06:30.427 --> 06:31.459
HOW'S IT GOING?

06:31.528 --> 06:34.962
WANT TO GET TOGETHER?"

06:35.031 --> 06:36.397
WHEN YOU KNOW SOMEONE IS

06:36.466 --> 06:37.131
MASTURBATING COULD JUST AS

06:37.200 --> 06:37.832
EASILY BE A TEXT THAT SAYS "U

06:37.901 --> 06:39.033

06:39.102 --> 06:40.268
SMILEY FACE TONGUE-OUT EMOJI."

06:40.337 --> 06:41.402

06:41.471 --> 06:42.203
I KNOW THE ANIMATED CHARACTERS

06:42.272 --> 06:43.638

07:10.700 --> 07:11.232
THAT'S ENOUGH TO GIVE ME THE

07:11.301 --> 07:12.400
EXTRA STRENGTH I NEED TO WIN THE

07:12.469 --> 07:14.335
FIGHT.

07:14.404 --> 07:15.269
>> John: NO!

07:15.338 --> 07:16.737
DO NOT BRING JEFF INTO THIS.

07:16.806 --> 07:18.840
HE'S AT WORK!

07:18.909 --> 07:19.640
HE DOESN'T NEED TO GET UP TO THE

07:19.709 --> 07:21.242
MINUTE NOTIFICATIONS ABOUT YOU

07:21.311 --> 07:23.344
SCRAPING YOUR APE TO

07:23.413 --> 07:26.514
"STEPSIBLING PORN, LONG LEGS."

07:26.583 --> 07:30.017
AGAIN, I FEEL LIKE THIS APP MAY

07:30.086 --> 07:31.385
BE HAVING THE OPPOSITE OF ITS

07:31.454 --> 07:32.687
INTENDED EFFECT.

07:32.756 --> 07:33.321
I'M JUST SAYING, IF I WERE THIS

07:33.390 --> 07:34.622
GUY'S WIFE, I'D WORRY LESS ABOUT

07:34.691 --> 07:35.556
THE PORN THING, AND MORE ABOUT

07:35.625 --> 07:37.191
THE JEFF THING.

07:37.260 --> 07:37.992
NOT ONLY ARE THEY SHARING THEIR

07:38.061 --> 07:39.627
PORN SEARCHES WITH EACH OTHER,

07:39.696 --> 07:40.163
THEY'RE ALSO GOING ON CUTE

07:40.230 --> 07:41.262
MUFFIN DATES: A LEVEL OF

07:41.331 --> 07:43.464
INTIMACY HIS WIFE CAN ONLY

07:43.533 --> 07:44.599
IMAGINE!

07:44.668 --> 07:45.199
AND, JUST LOOK HOW HAPPY JEFF

07:45.268 --> 07:46.567
SEEMS TO MAKE HIM!

07:46.636 --> 07:48.369
HE'S GLOWING!

07:48.438 --> 07:48.970
HIS WIFE BETTER OPEN HER EYES

07:49.039 --> 07:51.672
AND REALIZE THERE ARE THREE

07:51.741 --> 07:52.907
PEOPLE IN THIS MARRIAGE, AND

07:52.976 --> 07:55.510
SHE'S THE THIRD.

07:55.579 --> 07:56.144
AND LOOK: WHILE THIS IS FUN, A

07:56.213 --> 07:56.878
FEW THINGS.

07:56.947 --> 07:58.112
FIRST, IT'S PROBABLY NOT IDEAL

07:58.181 --> 07:59.280
FOR NATIONAL SECURITY, IF A GUY

07:59.349 --> 08:01.349
SECOND IN LINE TO THE PRESIDENCY

08:01.418 --> 08:02.683
HAS THAT APP ON HIS PHONE.

08:02.752 --> 08:03.518
BUT ALSO, THE STUFF PEOPLE ARE

08:03.587 --> 08:04.585
NOW UNEARTHING ABOUT MIKE

08:04.654 --> 08:05.887
JOHNSON EXTENDS BEYOND THE

08:05.956 --> 08:07.455
PERSONAL.

08:07.524 --> 08:08.856
JUST LAST WEEK, IT EMERGED HE'D

08:08.925 --> 08:10.124
BOTH PROMOTED AND WRITTEN THE

08:10.193 --> 08:11.626

08:11.695 --> 08:13.594
MANIFESTO," A BOOK BY A

08:13.663 --> 08:15.129
RIGHT-WING BLOGGER THAT, AMONG

08:15.198 --> 08:16.898
OTHER THINGS, GIVES CREDENCE TO

08:16.967 --> 08:18.533
UNFOUNDED CONSPIRACY THEORIES,

08:18.602 --> 08:20.601
INCLUDING THE 'PIZZAGATE' HOAX

08:20.670 --> 08:21.803
AND DISPARAGES POOR VOTERS AS

08:21.872 --> 08:22.837
"UNSOPHISTICATED AND SUSCEPTIBLE

08:22.906 --> 08:24.605
TO GOVERNMENT DEPENDENCY" WHO

08:24.674 --> 08:26.707
ARE "EASY TO MANIPULATE WITH

08:26.776 --> 08:27.542
"BLACK LIVES MATTER 'DEFUND THE

08:27.611 --> 08:28.843
POLICE' PANDERING."

08:28.912 --> 08:31.546
A PRETTY CLEAR DOG WHISTLE.

08:31.615 --> 08:32.115
NOW, A JOHNSON SPOKESPERSON

08:32.182 --> 08:33.381
INSISTS HE NEVER READ THOSE

08:33.450 --> 08:34.849
PASSAGES, WHICH HE STRONGLY

08:34.918 --> 08:36.651
DISAGREES WITH, AND THAT HE

08:36.720 --> 08:38.019
WROTE THE FOREWORD AS A FAVOR,

08:38.088 --> 08:39.520
NOT AS AN ENDORSEMENT OF ALL THE

08:39.589 --> 08:41.289
OPINIONS EXPRESSED.

08:41.358 --> 08:42.924
BUT, JOHNSON HIMSELF WOULD

08:42.993 --> 08:44.625
DISAGREE WITH THAT, GIVEN WHAT

08:44.694 --> 08:46.027
HE SAID LAST YEAR ON HIS OWN

08:46.096 --> 08:47.962
PODCAST.

08:48.031 --> 08:48.796
>> I OBVIOUSLY BELIEVE IN THE

08:48.865 --> 08:50.231
PRODUCT, OR I WOULDN'T HAVE

08:50.300 --> 08:51.032
WRITTEN THE FOREWORD.

08:51.101 --> 08:52.567
SO, I ENDORSE THE WORK.

08:52.636 --> 08:52.936
LOOK, I LOVE IT.

08:53.003 --> 08:54.569
I LOVE THE BOOK.

08:54.638 --> 08:55.403
EVERYBODY CAN GO AND GET THE

08:55.472 --> 08:56.337
BOOK.

08:56.406 --> 08:57.538
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.

08:57.607 --> 08:58.108
>> John: YEAH, TURNS OUT HIS

08:58.175 --> 08:59.740
ENDORSEMENT WAS PRETTY

08:59.809 --> 09:00.808
FULL-THROATED.

09:00.877 --> 09:01.609
WHICH, INCIDENTALLY, IS A GOOGLE

09:01.678 --> 09:03.478
IMAGE SEARCH STRICTLY OFF LIMITS

09:03.547 --> 09:04.745

09:04.814 --> 09:05.880
AND, I'M SURE THAT'S NOT THE

09:05.949 --> 09:06.647
LAST UPSETTING REVELATION WE'RE

09:06.716 --> 09:08.049
GOING TO GET ABOUT HIM.

09:08.118 --> 09:09.317
BUT, IT'S TOO LATE.

09:09.386 --> 09:10.785
HE'S ALREADY SPEAKER.

09:10.854 --> 09:11.652
FOR ALL THE FEAR OF A SECOND

09:11.721 --> 09:13.354
TRUMP TERM, IT'S WORTH

09:13.423 --> 09:14.455
REMEMBERING: OUR CURRENT SPEAKER

09:14.524 --> 09:16.190
OF THE HOUSE IS AN ANTI-LGBT

09:16.259 --> 09:17.558
BIGOT WHO BELIEVES IN MORE

09:17.627 --> 09:19.327
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR HIS SON'S

09:19.396 --> 09:20.361
PORN SEARCH HISTORY THAN HE DOES

09:20.430 --> 09:21.596
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO TRIED TO

09:21.665 --> 09:23.331
OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT.

09:23.400 --> 09:25.099
BUT THANKFULLY, THIS ISN'T

09:25.168 --> 09:26.534
INSURRECTION FOOTAGE: HE CAN'T

09:26.603 --> 09:28.035
BLUR HIS VIEWS AND HOPE NO ONE

09:28.104 --> 09:29.170
NOTICES.

09:29.239 --> 09:31.072
BECAUSE -- MUCH LIKE HIS SON --

09:31.141 --> 09:32.006
WE'RE ALL, UNFORTUNATELY, NOW

09:32.075 --> 09:32.342

10:51.521 --> 10:52.120
HOLY SMOKE.

10:52.189 --> 10:52.589
WHAT HAPPENED?

10:52.656 --> 10:53.387

10:53.456 --> 10:55.456
I DON'T KNOW, BUT THE WAY THAT

10:55.525 --> 10:57.492

10:57.561 --> 10:57.961

11:02.966 --> 11:03.531

11:03.600 --> 11:04.599

11:04.668 --> 11:05.168

11:09.172 --> 11:10.471
TRAINS AREN'T JUST A MODE OF

11:10.540 --> 11:11.105

11:11.174 --> 11:12.874

11:12.943 --> 11:13.508
LIKE "THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE" --

11:13.577 --> 11:14.842
EXCEPT, NOT THAT ONE.

11:14.911 --> 11:16.144

FRIGHTENED OF THE RAIN, AND

11:23.687 --> 11:24.519
WON'T COME OUT OF A TUNNEL.

11:24.588 --> 11:25.088
EVERYONE BEGS HIM, AND THEN

11:25.155 --> 11:26.654
YELLS AT HIM.

11:26.723 --> 11:27.755
THOMAS EVEN TRIES TO PHYSICALLY

11:27.824 --> 11:28.356

DRASTIC SOLUTION.

HERE FOR ALWAYS AND ALWAYS AND

11:39.169 --> 11:41.436
ALWAYS."

11:41.505 --> 11:42.537
THEY TOOK UP THE OLD RAILS AND

11:42.606 --> 11:44.038
BUILT A WALL IN FRONT OF HIM SO

13:40.090 --> 13:40.490
[TRAIN HORN]

13:40.557 --> 13:41.923
-- TRAINS ARE MUCH BETTER FOR

13:41.992 --> 13:42.990
THE ENVIRONMENT, AS THEY ONLY

13:43.059 --> 13:43.858
ACCOUNT FOR 2% OF US

13:43.927 --> 13:45.193
TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS.

13:45.262 --> 13:46.127
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, AS WE SAW

13:46.196 --> 13:46.894
EARLIER THIS YEAR, IN EAST

13:46.963 --> 13:47.495
PALESTINE, OHIO, WHEN FREIGHT

13:47.564 --> 13:48.863
TRAINS GO OFF THE RAILS, THEY

13:48.932 --> 13:50.665
CAN CAUSE IMMENSE DAMAGE.

13:50.734 --> 13:51.866
THAT CRASH INCURRED AN ESTIMATED

13:51.935 --> 13:53.801
COST OF AT LEAST $803 MILLION IN

13:53.870 --> 13:56.404
TOTAL DAMAGES, AND 80% OF

13:56.473 --> 13:58.072
RESIDENTS SURVEYED SAY THEY'VE

13:58.141 --> 13:59.607
EXPERIENCED HEADACHES, RASH,

13:59.676 --> 14:01.742
COUGHS, EYE IRRITATION AND

14:01.811 --> 14:02.977
DIARRHEA, AND ABOUT 40% SAID

14:03.046 --> 14:05.913
THEY SUFFER FROM PTSD.

14:05.982 --> 14:06.848
BUT, WHILE THAT WAS A

14:06.917 --> 14:08.549
PARTICULARLY NASTY DERAILMENT,

14:08.618 --> 14:09.183
THE TRUTH IS, IT SHOULDN'T HAVE

14:09.252 --> 14:11.385
BEEN THAT SURPRISING.

14:11.454 --> 14:12.620
LAST YEAR, THERE WERE MORE THAN

14:12.689 --> 14:14.255
1,000 TRAIN DERAILMENTS IN THE

14:14.324 --> 14:15.823
U.S.

14:15.892 --> 14:17.091
THAT MEANS AN AVERAGE OF THREE

14:17.160 --> 14:18.292
PER DAY.

14:18.361 --> 14:19.961
AND, WHILE MOST OCCUR IN RAIL

14:20.030 --> 14:20.928
YARDS AND AREN'T MAJOR

14:20.997 --> 14:22.263
INCIDENTS, THE ONES THAT OCCUR

14:22.332 --> 14:23.764
OUTSIDE OF THEM, CAN CAUSE A

14:23.833 --> 14:25.032
HUGE MESS.

14:25.101 --> 14:26.801
>> THE FLAMING FREIGHT TRAIN

14:26.870 --> 14:27.735
INFERNO OUTSIDE PHOENIX,

14:27.804 --> 14:28.903
ARIZONA, DERAILING ON A BRIDGE

14:28.972 --> 14:30.538
IN TEMPE.

14:30.607 --> 14:31.873
>> A RUNAWAY TRAIN DERAILING IN

14:31.942 --> 14:32.840
THE MOJAVE DESERT CAUSING A

14:32.909 --> 14:34.108
MANGLED MESS.

14:34.177 --> 14:35.977
>> TONIGHT, NEW DASH CAM VIDEO

14:36.046 --> 14:36.546
SHOWS THE MOMENT A NORFOLK

14:36.613 --> 14:38.646
SOUTHERN TRAIN DERAILED IN

14:38.715 --> 14:40.014
SPRINGFIELD, OHIO.

14:40.083 --> 14:40.982
>> FROM LIVE COPTER 3, AN

14:41.051 --> 14:42.049
EXCLUSIVE VIEW AT THE UNION

14:42.118 --> 14:44.051
PACIFIC TRAIN DERAILMENT.

14:44.120 --> 14:46.320
33 CARS TOTAL, 22 DERAILED.

14:46.389 --> 14:48.289
A RED SUBSTANCE WAS SPILLED, BUT

14:48.358 --> 14:48.890
OFFICIALS HAVE NOT CONFIRMED

14:48.959 --> 14:52.160
WHAT IT IS.

14:52.229 --> 14:53.628
>> John: NONE OF THAT IS GOOD,

14:53.697 --> 14:55.463
BUT THE PHRASE "A RED SUBSTANCE

14:55.532 --> 14:56.430
WAS SPILLED BUT OFFICIALS HAVE

14:56.499 --> 14:57.365
NOT CONFIRMED WHAT IT IS" IS

14:57.434 --> 14:59.500
TRULY CHILLING.

14:59.569 --> 15:00.935
IT SOUNDS LESS LIKE A LEGITIMATE

15:01.004 --> 15:01.836
NEWS REPORT AND MORE LIKE THE

15:01.905 --> 15:02.437
FIRST DRAFT OF A STEPHEN KING

15:02.506 --> 15:04.472
NOVEL.

15:04.541 --> 15:05.273
TRAIN DERAILMENTS HAPPEN A LOT,

15:05.342 --> 15:07.475
AND EXPERTS SAY THE REASON WE

15:07.544 --> 15:08.342
HAVEN'T HAD MASSIVE LOSS OF LIFE

15:08.411 --> 15:09.844
IN THIS COUNTRY AS A RESULT IS

15:09.913 --> 15:12.246
MORE LUCK THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

15:12.315 --> 15:13.080
>> THE RAILROADS ARE GOING TO

15:13.149 --> 15:14.782
KEEP FLIRTING WITH DANGER, KEEP

15:14.851 --> 15:16.250
FLIRTING WITH DISASTER, AS LONG

15:16.319 --> 15:20.924
AS PEOPLE ARE GETTING RICH

15:23.960 --> 15:24.427
AS PEOPLE ARE GETTING RICH

15:24.494 --> 15:25.460
I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT WE

15:25.529 --> 15:26.794
DODGED A BULLET IN EAST

15:26.863 --> 15:27.895
PALESTINE.

15:27.964 --> 15:28.496
BUT, THE NEXT ONE MAY BE IN A

15:28.565 --> 15:29.096
MAJOR URBAN AREA.

15:29.165 --> 15:30.364
IT MAY BE IN A DOWNTOWN CHICAGO.

15:30.433 --> 15:30.998
IT MAY BE IN A DOWNTOWN NEW YORK

15:31.067 --> 15:32.133
CITY.

15:32.202 --> 15:32.967
>> John: IT'S TERRIFYING TO

15:33.036 --> 15:34.135
THINK A TRAIN DISASTER LIKE EAST

15:34.204 --> 15:35.036
PALESTINE COULD HAPPEN IN NEW

15:35.105 --> 15:36.337
YORK.

15:36.406 --> 15:37.305
PARTLY BECAUSE I LIVE HERE, AND

15:37.374 --> 15:38.806
PARTLY BECAUSE NEW YORKERS ARE

15:38.875 --> 15:39.774
DEALING WITH ENOUGH DREAD AND

15:39.843 --> 15:43.611
PANIC AS IT IS.

15:43.680 --> 15:47.315
WE ARE A PERPETUAL TERROR

15:47.384 --> 15:48.483
TARGET, WE

15:48.552 --> 15:49.117
GOT THE COUNTRY'S FIRST BIG WAVE

15:49.186 --> 15:50.651
OF COVID, WE HAD A BIBLICAL

15:50.720 --> 15:52.186
PLAGUE OF LANTERNFLIES LAST

15:52.255 --> 15:52.820
SUMMER, AND THERE'S AN ARMY OF

15:52.889 --> 15:54.055
CREEPY ELMOS RUNNING RAMPANT IN

15:54.124 --> 15:55.423
TIMES SQUARE: WE DON'T HAVE THE

15:55.492 --> 15:56.791
ANXIETY BANDWIDTH TO ALSO WORRY

15:56.860 --> 15:57.360
ABOUT A GIANT TRAIN FULL OF

15:57.427 --> 15:58.893
POISON EXPLODING IN THE MIDDLE

15:58.962 --> 16:00.061
OF THE CITY.

16:00.130 --> 16:00.661
SO, IF FREIGHT TRAINS HAVE THE

16:00.730 --> 16:02.363
POWER TO CAUSE THAT MUCH DAMAGE,

16:02.432 --> 16:02.997
TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT THEM.

16:03.066 --> 16:04.265
AND, LET'S START WITH THE FACT

16:04.334 --> 16:05.133
THE FREIGHT RAIL INDUSTRY "USED"

16:05.202 --> 16:06.400
TO BE HEAVILY REGULATED.

16:06.469 --> 16:07.468
BUT, IN THE 1970S, AFTER THE

16:07.537 --> 16:08.569
INTERSTATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM CAME

16:08.638 --> 16:09.337
ALONG, AND RAIL SHIPPING LOST A

16:09.406 --> 16:10.872
LOT OF BUSINESS TO TRUCKING,

16:10.941 --> 16:11.939
THERE WAS PRESSURE TO DEREGULATE

16:12.008 --> 16:13.574
THE INDUSTRY SO IT COULD

16:13.643 --> 16:15.176
COMPETE.

16:15.245 --> 16:17.044
AND, IN 1980, A LOT OF THE

16:17.113 --> 16:17.678
CONTROLS WE'D HAD IN PLACE WERE

16:17.747 --> 16:19.647
REMOVED, ALLOWING FOR HUGE

16:19.716 --> 16:20.183
CONSOLIDATION OF RAILROAD

16:20.250 --> 16:21.516
COMPANIES, TO THE POINT WHERE --

16:21.585 --> 16:23.084
WHILE THERE USED TO BE OVER 100

16:23.153 --> 16:24.018
CLASS 1 RAILROADS IN NORTH

16:24.087 --> 16:27.088
AMERICA, THERE ARE NOW JUST SIX

16:27.157 --> 16:27.889
MASSIVE, EXTREMELY POWERFUL

16:27.958 --> 16:29.223
COMPANIES.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.892
AND, MUCH OF THE OVERSIGHT OF

16:30.961 --> 16:32.627
SAFETY IS LEFT TO THE FEDERAL

16:32.696 --> 16:34.028
RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION, WHICH

16:34.097 --> 16:35.630
IS A FAIRLY WEAK REGULATOR.

16:35.699 --> 16:36.597
AND, IT'S NOT JUST ME SAYING

16:36.666 --> 16:37.498
THAT: A GOVERNMENT REPORT FOUND

16:37.567 --> 16:39.534
THAT THE AGENCY ITSELF ESTIMATES

16:39.603 --> 16:40.568
ITS INSPECTORS HAVE THE ABILITY

16:40.637 --> 16:42.837
TO INSPECT LESS THAN 1% OF THE

16:42.906 --> 16:44.906
RAILROAD ACTIVITIES COVERED IN

16:44.975 --> 16:46.507
REGULATION.

16:46.576 --> 16:47.508
AND, AS A RESULT, RAILROADS

16:47.577 --> 16:49.343
THEMSELVES HAVE THE PRIMARY

16:49.412 --> 16:51.446
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SAFETY OF

16:51.515 --> 16:52.780
THE RAILROAD SYSTEM.

16:52.849 --> 16:54.515
AND, IF HISTORY HAS TAUGHT US

16:54.584 --> 16:58.619
ANYTHING, THAT'S NOT A FORMULA

16:58.688 --> 17:00.221
FOR GOOD OUTCOMES.

17:00.290 --> 17:00.922
IF ANYTHING, THE FORMULA IS

17:00.991 --> 17:02.790
"INDUSTRY PLUS DEREGULATION

17:02.859 --> 17:04.025
MINUS GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT

17:04.094 --> 17:04.594
EQUALS EPISODE OF "LAST WEEK

17:04.661 --> 17:06.494
TONIGHT"."

17:06.563 --> 17:08.629
AND, GUESS WHAT?

17:08.698 --> 17:08.965
HERE WE ARE!

17:09.032 --> 17:10.198
ALTHOUGH, I'LL GIVE THE FRA SOME

17:10.267 --> 17:12.233
CREDIT: IT DOES PRODUCE SOME

17:12.302 --> 17:13.100
SPECTACULAR RAILWAY-SAFETY

17:13.169 --> 17:14.035
VIDEOS TO SHOW YOU WHAT NOT TO

17:14.104 --> 17:18.439
DO AROUND TRAIN TRACKS.

17:18.508 --> 17:21.175
>> SHOOT.

17:21.244 --> 17:22.844
I THINK THE CAR JUST DIED.

17:22.913 --> 17:24.278
UGH.

17:24.347 --> 17:24.848
SERIOUSLY, THIS IS NOT

17:24.915 --> 17:25.913
HAPPENING.

17:25.982 --> 17:27.048
>> WHY DID WE STOP?

17:27.117 --> 17:28.082
WHAT HAPPENED?

17:28.151 --> 17:29.383
>> ARE WE STUCK?

17:29.452 --> 17:31.552
>> IT'S FINE.

17:31.621 --> 17:32.220
WE'LL JUST -- WE'LL SIT HERE FOR

17:32.289 --> 17:35.423
A MINUTE, AND I WILL CALL

17:35.492 --> 17:39.527
SOMEONE.

17:39.596 --> 17:40.161
>> BUT, WHAT IF THERE'S A TRAIN

17:40.230 --> 17:41.496
COMING?

17:41.565 --> 17:43.364
>> DON'T WORRY.

17:43.433 --> 17:43.998
THERE'S NEVER A TRAIN HERE, AND

17:44.067 --> 17:45.032
I'M SURE WE WOULD HEAR ONE

17:45.101 --> 17:49.270
COMING FROM PRETTY FAR AWAY.

17:49.339 --> 17:53.775
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:53.844 --> 17:54.344
IT'S HARD TO PICK A FAVORITE

17:54.411 --> 17:58.579
REACTION FROM THE WORLD'S

17:58.648 --> 17:59.180
CALMEST OR DUMBEST MOM -- "I

17:59.249 --> 18:00.782
THINK THE CAR JUST DIED" WHEN

18:00.851 --> 18:02.216
YOUR CAR 'CLEARLY' DIED IS AN

18:02.285 --> 18:03.718
OBVIOUS HALL OF FAMER -- BUT FOR

18:03.787 --> 18:04.287
MY MONEY, I'M GOING WITH THE

18:04.354 --> 18:05.753
ABSOLUTE BLIND CONFIDENCE OF

18:05.822 --> 18:06.387
"THERE'S NEVER A TRAIN HERE," A

18:06.456 --> 18:07.822
FACT SHE CANNOT KNOW AND DOESN'T

18:07.891 --> 18:09.290
SEEM TO TOTALLY BELIEVE HERSELF.

18:09.359 --> 18:10.258
ALSO -- AND THIS ISN'T HUGELY

18:10.327 --> 18:15.763
IMPORTANT -- BUT "I WILL CALL

18:15.832 --> 18:16.032
SOMEONE?"

18:16.099 --> 18:16.998
"WHO" EXACTLY DO YOU THINK YOU'D

18:17.067 --> 18:18.166
CALL?

18:18.235 --> 18:18.833
AND, HOW DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD

18:18.902 --> 18:19.867
GO?

18:19.936 --> 18:20.468
"HI, MY CAR BROKE DOWN ON SOME

18:20.537 --> 18:21.037
TRAIN TRACKS, I'M IN THE CAR

18:21.104 --> 18:22.703
WITH MY CHILDREN."

18:22.772 --> 18:23.638
"GET OUT OF THE CAR AND OFF THE

18:23.707 --> 18:24.505
TRACKS."

18:24.574 --> 18:25.139
"I'M PRETTY SURE THERE'S NEVER A

18:25.208 --> 18:26.107
TRAIN HERE."

18:26.176 --> 18:27.175
"REALLY?

18:27.244 --> 18:27.744
BECAUSE TRAINS GENERALLY GO

18:27.811 --> 18:28.476
WHERE THE TRACKS ARE.

18:28.545 --> 18:29.377
PUT ONE OF YOUR CHILDREN ON THE

18:29.446 --> 18:30.645
PHONE."

18:30.714 --> 18:31.813
"ARE YOU GOING TO SEND SOMEONE

18:31.882 --> 18:33.047
TO HELP ME, OFFICER?

18:33.116 --> 18:33.681
"LADY, I'M NOT EVEN THE POLICE,

18:33.750 --> 18:34.749
THIS IS JUST A NUMBER YOU

18:34.818 --> 18:35.883
CALLED, GET OFF THE FUCKING

18:35.952 --> 18:37.018
TRACKS."

18:37.087 --> 18:38.619
BUT, BACK TO THE FRA.

18:38.688 --> 18:39.253
AS I WAS SAYING, THE PROBLEM IS

18:39.322 --> 18:40.121
THAT THEY HAVE LIMITED INSIGHT

18:40.190 --> 18:41.122
INTO WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING

18:41.191 --> 18:42.457
ON THE RAILS.

18:42.526 --> 18:43.558
AND, NOT EVERY PROBLEM IS AS

18:43.627 --> 18:43.726
PAUL

18:43.793 --> 18:49.263
EASY TO SOLVE AS TAKING AWAY

18:49.332 --> 18:49.964
THIS WOMAN'S DRIVERS LICENSE

18:50.033 --> 18:51.732
FOREVER.

18:51.801 --> 18:52.366
AS WE LEARNED IN EAST PALESTINE,

18:52.435 --> 18:56.571
SOME TRAINS HAUL HAZARDOUS

18:56.640 --> 18:57.140
MATERIALS, AND THE TRUTH IS,

18:57.207 --> 18:59.073
NEITHER THE FRA NOR ANYONE ELSE

18:59.142 --> 18:59.941
KNOWS THEY'RE THERE, WHICH IS

19:00.010 --> 19:01.509
WILD.

19:01.578 --> 19:03.744
IT'S CRAZY THAT THE FAA KNOWS

19:03.813 --> 19:04.314
ABOUT THE EXACT LOCATION OF

19:04.381 --> 19:04.946
5,000 PLANES IN THE SKY, BUT THE

19:05.015 --> 19:05.546
FRA CAN'T TELL YOU WHERE MOST

19:05.615 --> 19:06.214
TRAINS ARE, OR WHAT THEY

19:06.283 --> 19:07.181
CONTAIN.

19:07.250 --> 19:08.616
IN FACT, IN THE NEW YORK AREA A

19:08.685 --> 19:09.484
WHILE BACK, PEOPLE GOT PRETTY

19:09.553 --> 19:11.319
ALARMED WHEN THEY LEARNED THAT

19:11.388 --> 19:12.487
VOLATILE CRUDE OIL WAS BEING

19:12.556 --> 19:13.056
TRANSPORTED, RIGHT ALONG THE

19:13.123 --> 19:14.789
HUDSON RIVER.

19:14.858 --> 19:15.423
>> THIS IS THE GREATEST THREAT

19:15.492 --> 19:16.390
TO THE HUDSON I'VE EXPERIENCED

19:16.459 --> 19:18.960
IN MY ENTIRE CAREER.

19:19.029 --> 19:20.862
THESE TRAINS THAT RUN FOR ALMOST

19:20.931 --> 19:24.298
50 MILES RIGHT NEXT TO THE RIVER

19:24.367 --> 19:27.201
CARRYING HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE CRUDE

19:27.270 --> 19:31.038
OIL IN RAIL CARS THAT WERE NOT

19:31.107 --> 19:33.107
DESIGNED FOR THIS, THAT SHEER ON

19:33.176 --> 19:35.009
IMPACT.

19:35.078 --> 19:36.677
>> 120 CARS ON SOME OF THESE

19:36.746 --> 19:38.546
TRAINS, 30,000 GALLONS OF FUEL

19:38.615 --> 19:41.082
PER CAR, VERY VOLATILE FUEL.

19:41.151 --> 19:42.583
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT, EACH

19:42.652 --> 19:45.253
OF THESE TRAIN CARS IS LIKE A

19:45.322 --> 19:50.658
ROLLING BOMB.

19:50.727 --> 19:53.227
>> John: IT'S TRUE, AND THAT

19:53.296 --> 19:55.663
IS NOT UNIQUE TO THE HUDSON

19:55.732 --> 19:58.099
RAIL LINE.

19:58.168 --> 19:58.699
TRAINS THAT CARRY COMBUSTIBLE

19:58.768 --> 20:00.468
CARGO ARE REGULARLY REFERRED TO

20:00.537 --> 20:00.970
BY RAIL WORKERS AS "BOMB

20:01.037 --> 20:02.103
TRAINS."

20:02.172 --> 20:03.571
WHICH IS TERRIFYING.

20:03.640 --> 20:04.205
"BOMB TRAIN" DOESN'T SOUND LIKE

20:04.274 --> 20:04.806
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD EVER BE

20:04.875 --> 20:06.140
ALLOWED ON A RAILWAY: IT SOUNDS

20:06.209 --> 20:06.908
LIKE THE TITLE OF A JASON

20:06.977 --> 20:08.443
STATHAM MOVIE THAT'S GOT 27%ON

20:08.512 --> 20:09.644
ROTTEN TOMATOES.

20:09.713 --> 20:12.580
BUT, "ROLLING BOMB" IS A PRETTY

20:12.649 --> 20:14.184
STATHAM MOVIE THAT'S GOT 27% ON

20:17.521 --> 20:18.085
BUT, "ROLLING BOMB" IS A PRETTY

20:18.154 --> 20:19.620
ACCURATE DESCRIPTION.

20:19.689 --> 20:20.190
JUST 22 TRAIN CARS CARRYING

20:20.257 --> 20:21.255
LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS HOLD THE

20:21.324 --> 20:21.856
EQUIVALENT BLAST ENERGY OF THE

20:21.925 --> 20:22.723
NUCLEAR BOMB DROPPED ON

20:22.792 --> 20:24.192
HIROSHIMA.

20:24.261 --> 20:25.226
AND, THERE'VE BEEN INCIDENTS

20:25.295 --> 20:26.594
WHERE TRAIN CARS FULL OF CRUDE

20:26.663 --> 20:27.728
OIL HAVE EXPLODED IN POPULATED

20:27.797 --> 20:28.329
AREAS.

20:28.398 --> 20:29.764
IN CANADA IN 2013, THERE WAS AN

20:29.833 --> 20:30.865
EXPLOSION IN THE AREA OF

20:30.934 --> 20:31.999
LAC-MEGANTIC THAT KILLED 47

20:32.068 --> 20:33.167
PEOPLE AND LEFT THE TOWN LOOKING

20:33.236 --> 20:34.235
LIKE THIS, WHICH MAY NOT SEEM SO

20:34.304 --> 20:35.536
ALARMING, UNTIL YOU SEE WHAT

20:35.605 --> 20:36.404
THAT EXACT SPOT LOOKED LIKE

20:36.473 --> 20:37.572
BEFORE THE BLAST.

20:37.641 --> 20:39.173
IT'S HARD TO TELL, BUT IF YOU

20:39.242 --> 20:40.308
LOOK VERY CLOSELY, YOU'LL NOTICE

20:40.377 --> 20:41.075
THAT THE "TOWN" PART OF THAT

20:41.144 --> 20:42.743
TOWN IS GONE.

20:42.812 --> 20:44.145
AND, THE NOTION THAT PROFITS

20:44.214 --> 20:45.246
MIGHT BE GETTING PRIORITIZED

20:45.315 --> 20:46.347
OVER SAFETY IS IN KEEPING WITH

20:46.416 --> 20:47.582
THE LARGER TREND SHAPING THE

20:47.651 --> 20:48.983
FREIGHT RAIL INDUSTRY.

20:49.052 --> 20:49.452
BECAUSE, LIKE MANY BIG

20:49.519 --> 20:50.985
COMPANIES, THESE GIANT RAILWAY

20:51.054 --> 20:52.253
FIRMS HAVE FELT INCREASING

20:52.322 --> 20:53.321
PRESSURE TO SQUEEZE MARGINS TO

20:53.390 --> 20:54.956
PLEASE INVESTORS.

20:55.025 --> 20:56.491
AND, THAT BRINGS US TO THE KEY

20:56.560 --> 20:57.658
TREND IN FREIGHT RAIL OVER THE

20:57.727 --> 21:00.094
PAST FEW DECADES: PRECISION

21:00.163 --> 21:04.332
SCHEDULED RAILROADING, OR PSR.

21:04.401 --> 21:04.966
IT'S THE BRAINCHILD OF THIS MAN:

21:05.035 --> 21:06.000
HUNTER HARRISON, SEEN HERE

21:06.069 --> 21:08.436
MID-COLONOSCOPY.

21:08.505 --> 21:09.237
UNTIL HIS DEATH SIX YEARS AGO,

21:09.306 --> 21:11.239
HARRISON WORKED AS A CEO AT FOUR

21:11.308 --> 21:12.907
MAJOR RAILROADS, AND HIS

21:12.976 --> 21:13.908
PHILOSOPHY OF PSR HAS NOW TAKEN

21:13.977 --> 21:16.277
OVER THE INDUSTRY.

21:16.346 --> 21:17.011
AND, IT'S ABOUT AGGRESSIVELY

21:17.080 --> 21:22.683
PURSUING EFFICIENCY.

21:22.752 --> 21:23.253
TO THAT END, RAILROADS HAVE

21:23.320 --> 21:25.186
CLOSED FACILITIES, RETIRED

21:25.255 --> 21:26.721
LOCOMOTIVES AND RAILCARS AND CUT

21:26.790 --> 21:28.089
WORKERS TO LOWER COSTS.

21:28.158 --> 21:29.190
AND, ALL OF THAT IS THE KIND OF

21:29.259 --> 21:29.991
STUFF THAT MAKES WALL STREET

21:30.060 --> 21:31.125
IDIOTS EXTREMELY HAPPY.

21:31.194 --> 21:33.027
IN FACT, HERE'S ONE OF THEM NOW!

21:33.096 --> 21:38.599
>> HUNTER HARRISON!

21:38.668 --> 21:43.004
THE NEW DARLING OF WALL STREET

21:43.073 --> 21:43.540
HARRISON WILL IMPLEMENT A

21:43.607 --> 21:45.940
STRATEGY THAT'S KNOWN AS

21:46.009 --> 21:46.607
PRECISION SCHEDULED RAILROADING.

21:46.676 --> 21:47.475
HE'S ALREADY CHANGED ROUTES AND

21:47.544 --> 21:50.011
SCHEDULES AND THE WAY THE

21:50.080 --> 21:50.547
COMPANY SORTS LONG TRAINS.

21:50.614 --> 21:51.212
HE ACTUALLY MAPS THEM OUT IN HIS

21:51.281 --> 21:52.146
OWN LIVING ROOM.

21:52.215 --> 21:54.115
I'M NOT KIDDING.

21:54.184 --> 21:55.283
THIS GUY'S THE REAL DEAL.

21:55.352 --> 21:56.651
THE GUY IS THE TRAIN WHISPERER.

21:56.720 --> 21:57.385
>> John: COOL!

21:57.454 --> 21:58.553
YOU KNOW A PERSON IS PRETTY

21:58.622 --> 21:59.187
AWESOME IF THEY GET A RINGING,

21:59.256 --> 22:00.655
SOUND-EFFECT-LADEN ENDORSEMENT

22:00.724 --> 22:01.589
ON AN ESTEEMED SHOW LIKE "BIG

22:01.658 --> 22:02.490
BUCKS WORD PUKE WITH CAPTAIN

22:02.559 --> 22:03.691
MONEY CLOWN."

22:03.760 --> 22:04.592
BUT, IT'S TRUE: HUNTER HARRISON

22:04.661 --> 22:05.993
WAS THE TYPE OF GUY WHO MAPPED

22:06.062 --> 22:07.862
TRAIN ROUTES OUT AT HOME.

22:07.931 --> 22:11.432
HE WAS ALSO THE TYPE OF GUY WHO

22:11.501 --> 22:12.300
LOOKED FOR EVEN THE SMALLEST

22:12.369 --> 22:13.901
WAYS TO CUT COSTS, FROM TEARING

22:13.970 --> 22:14.869
UP UNUSED TRACKS TO ELIMINATING

22:14.938 --> 22:15.937
OVERNIGHT STAYS FOR TRAIN CREWS.

22:16.006 --> 22:17.305
HE EVEN FLEW AROUND IN A

22:17.374 --> 22:18.306
CORPORATE JET WITH A TAIL NUMBER

22:18.375 --> 22:20.575
THAT READ OR59, HIS ASPIRATIONAL

22:20.644 --> 22:22.510
OPERATING RATIO.

22:22.579 --> 22:24.112
PRESUMABLY SOMETHING THAT MADE

22:24.181 --> 22:24.946
HIM SO HAPPY, HE SMILED LIKE

22:25.015 --> 22:26.647
THIS.

22:26.716 --> 22:28.916
BUT, THAT EFFICIENCY FOR THE

22:28.985 --> 22:30.184
COMPANIES HAS COME AT TREMENDOUS

22:30.253 --> 22:31.519
COST TO EVERYONE ELSE.

22:31.588 --> 22:36.457
AND, LET'S START WITH ONE OF THE

22:36.526 --> 22:38.926
THINGS THAT MYSPACE MIGHT BE

22:38.995 --> 22:39.496
LOIS

22:41.031 --> 22:41.131
--

22:41.198 --> 22:46.801
THINGS THAT MAY BE LESS OBVIOUS,

22:46.870 --> 22:47.370
BECAUSE A KEY COMPONENT OF

22:47.437 --> 22:48.903
PRECISION SCHEDULED RAILROADING

22:48.972 --> 22:49.472
IS RUNNING FEWER, BUT MUCH

22:49.539 --> 22:52.573
LONGER TRAINS -- AND I MEAN

22:52.642 --> 22:53.076
"MUCH" LONGER.

22:53.143 --> 22:54.542
SOME TRAINS NOW STRETCH NEARLY

22:54.611 --> 22:55.443
THREE MILES LONG.

22:55.512 --> 22:56.210
AND, THOSE LONGER TRAINS AREN'T

22:56.279 --> 22:56.978
JUST DANGEROUS WHEN THEY'RE

22:57.047 --> 22:57.678
MOVING: THEY CAN ALSO BE

22:57.747 --> 22:58.946
DANGEROUS WHEN THEY'RE NOT.

22:59.015 --> 22:59.580
TRAINS FREQUENTLY NEED TO STOP

22:59.649 --> 23:00.581
TO ALLOW OTHER TRAINS TO PASS,

23:00.650 --> 23:02.049
OR TO WORK ON MECHANICAL ISSUES.

23:02.118 --> 23:02.585
AND, TRACKS WERE BUILT TO

23:02.652 --> 23:04.152
ACCOMMODATE THIS, WITH SIDINGS

23:04.221 --> 23:04.752
ALONGSIDE THE MAIN LINE, WHERE

23:04.821 --> 23:05.887
TRAINS CAN PULL OVER.

23:05.956 --> 23:07.255
THE PROBLEM IS, THOSE SIDINGS

23:07.324 --> 23:08.790
WERE BUILT WHEN TRAINS WERE MUCH

23:08.859 --> 23:09.423
SHORTER, AND NOWADAYS, WHEN THEY

23:09.492 --> 23:10.758
ARE MULTIPLE MILES LONG, THEY

23:10.827 --> 23:12.426
CAN WIND UP STRETCHING BACK ONTO

23:12.495 --> 23:13.194
THE MAIN TRACK, AND POSSIBLY

23:13.263 --> 23:14.428
ACROSS ROADS, BLOCKING TRAFFIC.

23:14.497 --> 23:16.364
AND, THAT'S ONE REASON WHY THIS

23:16.433 --> 23:17.498
CAN HAPPEN.

23:17.567 --> 23:17.967
>> FOR SOME EAST END

23:18.034 --> 23:19.700
NEIGHBORHOODS, THIS HAS BECOME A

23:19.769 --> 23:21.736
WAY TOO UNWELCOME SOUNDTRACK.

23:21.805 --> 23:23.704
THE BELLS START, TRAFFIC STOPS,

23:23.773 --> 23:24.472
THIS DRIVER SLEEPS, THIS GUY

23:24.541 --> 23:25.706
CLIMBS OVER, THIS ONE, TOO,

23:25.775 --> 23:27.375
ANOTHER RIGHT UNDER.

23:27.444 --> 23:28.743
ALL OF IT WITHOUT A THOUGHT TO

23:28.812 --> 23:29.644
THE POTENTIALLY DEADLY

23:29.713 --> 23:30.978
CONSEQUENCES.

23:31.047 --> 23:34.949
THE WAIT JUST BECOMES TOO LONG.

23:35.018 --> 23:36.717
WELL, HOW OFTEN DOES THIS

23:36.786 --> 23:37.785
HAPPEN, LORENZO?

23:37.854 --> 23:39.754
>> UM, JUST ABOUT EVERY DAY.

23:39.823 --> 23:40.354
>> John: IT'S TRUE: IN CERTAIN

23:40.423 --> 23:41.656
TOWNS, TRAINS CAN BLOCK TRAFFIC,

23:41.725 --> 23:43.157
AND FOR HOURS.

23:43.226 --> 23:43.891
AND, IT'S NOT LIKE THEY CAN

23:43.960 --> 23:44.725
QUICKLY GET OUT OF THE WAY BY

23:44.794 --> 23:46.027
TURNING AROUND.

23:46.096 --> 23:46.861
TRAINS ARE LIKE LIAM PAYNE: THEY

23:46.930 --> 23:47.728
REALLY ONLY WORK IN ONE

23:47.797 --> 23:49.564
DIRECTION.

23:49.633 --> 23:51.766
LAST YEAR ALONE, THERE WERE MORE

23:51.835 --> 23:53.634
THAN 30,000 REPORTS OF BLOCKED

23:53.703 --> 23:55.470
TRAIN CROSSINGS ACROSS THE

23:55.539 --> 23:56.971
NATION, WITH NEARLY 1,000

23:57.040 --> 23:58.606
BLOCKED FOR MORE THAN A DAY.

23:58.675 --> 24:00.508
AND, THAT CAN MEAN PEOPLE WIND

24:00.577 --> 24:01.609
UP MAKING RISKY DECISIONS TO GET

24:01.678 --> 24:03.744
TO WORK -- OR EVEN TO SCHOOL.

24:03.813 --> 24:04.745
>> IT'S THE KIND OF MOMENT THAT

24:04.814 --> 24:06.514
TAKES YOUR BREATH AWAY.

24:06.583 --> 24:07.748
A LITTLE GIRL IN A BRIGHT RED

24:07.817 --> 24:08.850
COAT.

24:08.919 --> 24:10.118
TINY ARMS AND LEGS, WIGGLING

24:10.187 --> 24:11.352
UNDERNEATH A TRAIN CAR THAT

24:11.421 --> 24:13.688
COULD MOVE AT ANY MOMENT.

24:13.757 --> 24:15.156
IT'S QUIET AS SHE DUSTS HERSELF

24:15.225 --> 24:17.225
OFF, CASUALLY PICKS UP HER

24:17.294 --> 24:18.459
BOOKBAG AND A DROPPED WATER

24:18.528 --> 24:21.262
BOTTLE, AND CARRIES ON.

24:21.331 --> 24:23.164
>> John: THAT'S TOUGH TO WATCH,

24:23.233 --> 24:25.233
BUT IT'S KIND OF NICE FOR THE

24:25.302 --> 24:26.200
YOUNGER GENERATION TO HAVE AN

24:26.269 --> 24:27.769
IMMEDIATE COUNTER WHENEVER THEIR

24:27.838 --> 24:28.369
OLDER RELATIVES COMPLAIN ABOUT

24:28.438 --> 24:29.170
HOW THEY USED TO WALK TO SCHOOL

24:29.239 --> 24:30.304
IN THE SNOW.

24:30.373 --> 24:31.806
"OH, WAS IT COLD, GRAMPA?

24:31.875 --> 24:33.207
DIDYA GET CHILLY?

24:33.276 --> 24:34.442
GUESS I WASN'T REALLY THINKING

24:34.511 --> 24:37.145
ABOUT THE WEATHER WHEN I WAS

24:37.214 --> 24:39.013
CRAWLING UNDER A TRAIN THAT

24:39.082 --> 24:40.448
COULD CRUSH MY TINY ARMS AND

24:40.517 --> 24:41.215
LEGS' TO GET TO HOMEROOM ON

24:41.284 --> 24:42.517
TIME."

24:42.586 --> 24:43.651
AND, WHILE THAT GIRL,

24:43.720 --> 24:44.485
THANKFULLY, WAS OKAY, OTHERS

24:44.554 --> 24:50.925
HAVEN'T BEEN.

24:50.994 --> 24:51.461
PEDESTRIANS TRYING TO CUT

24:51.528 --> 24:52.827
THROUGH TRAINS HAVE BEEN

24:52.896 --> 24:54.162
DISFIGURED, DISMEMBERED AND

24:54.231 --> 24:55.363
KILLED, AFTER THE TRAINS

24:55.432 --> 24:56.697
SUDDENLY STARTED MOVING.

24:56.766 --> 24:57.331
ON TOP OF WHICH, BLOCKED TRAINS

24:57.400 --> 24:58.032
CAN ALSO SERIOUSLY DELAY

24:58.101 --> 24:59.667
EMERGENCY SERVICES, LIKE FIRE

24:59.736 --> 25:00.601
ENGINES OR AMBULANCES, AS THIS

25:00.670 --> 25:02.103
OKLAHOMA MAN KNOWS ALL TOO WELL.

25:02.172 --> 25:03.070
>> I THINK IT'S GONNA TAKE A

25:03.139 --> 25:04.806
MAJOR TRAGEDY FOR THE RAILROAD

25:04.875 --> 25:06.574
COMPANY TO WAKE UP AND DECIDE

25:06.643 --> 25:08.142
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO

25:08.211 --> 25:09.610
SOMETHING.

25:09.679 --> 25:10.244
>> THAT WAS ABOUT SIX AND A HALF

25:10.313 --> 25:12.814
YEARS AGO.

25:12.883 --> 25:13.383
CHAD BYRD COMPLAINING ABOUT

25:13.450 --> 25:15.149
THESE TRACKS NEAR THEIR HOME.

25:15.218 --> 25:16.484
AND, AT THE TIME, SITTING ON THE

25:16.553 --> 25:17.552
ONLY CROSSING TO GET TO THEIR

25:17.621 --> 25:19.120
HOME.

25:19.189 --> 25:19.854
>> I THINK THE MAJOR CONCERN IS,

25:19.923 --> 25:21.322
IF SOMEBODY'S INJURED, TRYING TO

25:21.391 --> 25:23.191
GET AN AMBULANCE TO THAT SIDE.

25:23.260 --> 25:23.991
>> FAST FORWARD TO EARLY

25:24.060 --> 25:25.893
SEPTEMBER OF 2020.

25:25.962 --> 25:26.694
CHAD'S PREMONITIONS BECOMING

25:26.763 --> 25:27.962
REALITY.

25:28.031 --> 25:29.297
HIS FATHER, LARRY GENE BYRD,

25:29.366 --> 25:31.699
DYING FROM A HEART ATTACK, AND

25:31.768 --> 25:32.667
EMERGENCY VEHICLES WERE STUCK

25:32.736 --> 25:33.501
BEHIND A TRAIN ON THOSE SAME

25:33.570 --> 25:35.002
TRACKS.

25:35.071 --> 25:35.937
WHEN EMERGENCY CREWS ARRIVED,

25:36.006 --> 25:37.105
POLICE ASKED THE CONDUCTOR IF IT

25:37.174 --> 25:38.806
COULD BE MOVED.

25:38.875 --> 25:40.074
HE SAID NO.

25:40.143 --> 25:40.775
THE LAWSUIT ADDING THAT HE

25:40.844 --> 25:42.110
QUOTE, "CLOSED THE LOCOMOTIVE'S

25:42.179 --> 25:45.713
WINDOW AND WOULD NOT RESPOND TO

25:45.782 --> 25:47.381
ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS."

25:47.450 --> 25:47.982
>> John: THAT'S AWFUL.

25:48.051 --> 25:49.317
AND, WHILE IT'S NOT THE MOST

25:49.386 --> 25:52.253
IMPORTANT THING, ARE WE ALL

25:52.322 --> 25:52.789
ALLOWED TO JUST CLOSE OUR

25:52.856 --> 25:53.855
WINDOWS AND NOT TALK TO COPS?

25:53.924 --> 25:54.424
OR, IS THAT ONLY FOR TRAIN

25:54.491 --> 25:55.723
CONDUCTORS?

25:55.792 --> 25:56.691
BECAUSE IF SO, I WILL BUY ONE OF

25:56.760 --> 25:58.326
THOSE STUPID LITTLE HATS

25:58.395 --> 25:59.827
TOMORROW.

25:59.896 --> 26:00.895
BUT ALSO, I WOULDN'T CALL HIS

26:00.964 --> 26:02.396
PREDICTION A "PREMONITION."

26:02.465 --> 26:03.431
IT WAS AN EASILY FORESEEABLE

26:03.500 --> 26:05.800
CONSEQUENCE OF POOR POLICY.

26:05.869 --> 26:07.268
AND, THAT'S NOT A ONE-OFF: THERE

26:07.337 --> 26:08.402
HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE SIMILAR

26:08.471 --> 26:09.837
STORIES OF PEOPLE DYING AND

26:09.906 --> 26:11.139
HOUSES BURNING DOWN AFTER

26:11.208 --> 26:12.140
EMERGENCY VEHICLES WERE DELAYED

26:12.209 --> 26:13.775
AT CROSSINGS.

26:13.844 --> 26:15.643
BUT, LONGER STOPPED TRAINS ARE

26:15.712 --> 26:16.611
JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE ISSUES

26:16.680 --> 26:19.714
WITH PSR.

26:19.783 --> 26:20.348
THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE OF WHAT

26:20.417 --> 26:22.183
THE RELENTLESS DRIVE FOR SAVINGS

26:22.252 --> 26:22.850
DOES TO WORKERS.

26:22.919 --> 26:24.652
EVEN AS TRAINS GOT LONGER,

26:24.721 --> 26:25.553
STAFFING HAS BEEN CUT TO

26:25.622 --> 26:27.221
RIDICULOUSLY LOW LEVELS.

26:27.290 --> 26:29.090
JUST WATCH AS A UNION LEADER

26:29.159 --> 26:29.757
EXPLAINS TO A FLABBERGASTED NEWS

26:29.826 --> 26:31.058
ANCHOR, RIGHT AFTER EAST

26:31.127 --> 26:32.660
PALESTINE, JUST HOW LOW THESE

26:32.729 --> 26:34.796
LEVELS HAD BECOME.

26:34.865 --> 26:36.931
>> LOOK, IF YOU ADD MORE AND

26:37.000 --> 26:37.965
MORE CARS TO THESE TRAINS,

26:38.034 --> 26:39.834
YOU'RE INTRODUCING MORE AND MORE

26:39.903 --> 26:41.903
POINTS OF POTENTIAL FAILURE.

26:41.972 --> 26:43.104
AND, THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY

26:43.173 --> 26:44.439
ALARMING THAT THE RAILROAD

26:44.508 --> 26:46.174
INDUSTRY ACTUALLY WANTS TO CUT

26:46.243 --> 26:48.276
BACK THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

26:48.345 --> 26:48.876
OPERATING ON A TRAIN FROM TWO,

26:48.945 --> 26:49.677
AS IS THE CURRENT STANDARD, TO

26:49.746 --> 26:50.611
ONE.

26:50.680 --> 26:52.046
>> I'M SORRY, HOLD ON.

26:52.115 --> 26:53.181
ARE YOU SAYING THAT AS OF NOW, A

26:53.250 --> 26:55.016
TRAIN WITH 150 CARS AND THAT IS

26:55.085 --> 26:57.118
CARRYING HAZARDOUS MATERIAL --

26:57.187 --> 26:59.554
VINYL CHLORIDE, WHATEVER -- AS A

26:59.623 --> 27:00.588
STANDARD, ONLY, -- ONLY HAS TWO

27:00.657 --> 27:01.789
PEOPLE OPERATING IT?

27:01.858 --> 27:04.225
JUST TWO FOR THAT ENTIRE TRAIN?

27:04.294 --> 27:04.826
>> YEAH, THAT'S CORRECT.

27:04.895 --> 27:06.260
ONE CONDUCTOR, ONE ENGINEER.

27:06.329 --> 27:06.994
>> AND, THEY WANT TO CUT IT DOWN

27:07.063 --> 27:08.129
TO ONE.

27:08.198 --> 27:10.498
>> YES.

27:10.567 --> 27:11.899
>> John: RIGHT, ONE PERSON.

27:11.968 --> 27:13.034
WHICH IS ABSURD.

27:13.103 --> 27:14.735
TRAINS NEED AN ENGINEER TO DRIVE

27:14.804 --> 27:15.803
THE TRAIN AND A CONDUCTOR FOR

27:15.872 --> 27:16.704
THE REST OF IT.

27:16.773 --> 27:17.738
IT'S NOT ONE OF THOSE JOBS WHERE

27:17.807 --> 27:19.774
WE HAVE TWO PEOPLE DO IT, EVEN

27:19.843 --> 27:20.808
THOUGH IT CLEARLY ONLY REQUIRES

27:20.877 --> 27:22.877
ONE, LIKE ANCHORING THE NEWS OR

27:22.946 --> 27:24.412
RENOVATING A HOME, OR HOSTING

27:24.481 --> 27:27.215
THE 2011 OSCARS.

27:27.284 --> 27:28.583
AND, PEOPLE WHO WORK ON THESE

27:28.652 --> 27:29.917
TRAINS WILL TELL YOU, EVERY PART

27:29.986 --> 27:32.653
OF THEIR JOB IS EXHAUSTING NOW.

27:32.722 --> 27:35.456
FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THERE IS A

27:35.525 --> 27:37.291
MECHANICAL OR OTHER PROBLEM THAT

27:37.360 --> 27:39.227
CAUSES A TRAIN TO STOP, THE

27:39.296 --> 27:40.194
CONDUCTOR MAY HAVE TO WALK FROM

27:40.263 --> 27:40.730
THE LEAD LOCOMOTIVE TO THE

27:40.797 --> 27:42.396
PROBLEM AREA AND BACK AGAIN,

27:42.465 --> 27:44.866
WHICH COULD MEAN WALKING 4 MILES

27:44.935 --> 27:45.500
TO THE END AND BACK ON A 2-MILE

27:45.569 --> 27:46.934
LONG TRAIN.

27:47.003 --> 27:47.735
WORKERS ARE BEING STRETCHED SO

27:47.804 --> 27:49.203
THIN THAT THEY'RE NOW WORKING

27:49.272 --> 27:50.905
RIDICULOUS HOURS AND REQUIRED TO

27:50.974 --> 27:51.973
BE ON CALL, FORCING THEM TO PICK

27:52.042 --> 27:54.375
AND CHOOSE BETWEEN WORK AND

27:54.444 --> 27:56.644
THEIR FAMILIES, AND EVEN MEDICAL

27:56.713 --> 27:58.079
APPOINTMENTS.

27:58.148 --> 27:59.413
UNTIL RECENTLY, WHEN WORKERS

27:59.482 --> 28:00.948
WANTED TO TAKE A SICK DAY AT

28:01.017 --> 28:01.716
BNSF -- THE LARGEST FREIGHT

28:01.785 --> 28:03.284
RAILROAD IN THE US -- THEY HAD

28:03.353 --> 28:04.318
TO SCHEDULE THEM A MONTH IN

28:04.387 --> 28:05.286
ADVANCE, AND ONLY FOR TUESDAY,

28:05.355 --> 28:08.256
WEDNESDAY, OR THURSDAY.

28:08.325 --> 28:09.357
AND, I DON'T KNOW HOW BNSF

28:09.426 --> 28:11.025
THINKS ILLNESSES WORK, BUT THE

28:11.094 --> 28:12.827
FLU DOESN'T HAVE A MICROSOFT

28:12.896 --> 28:14.295
OUTLOOK CALENDAR WHERE YOU CAN

28:14.364 --> 28:15.763
LOOK AT ITS SCHEDULE AND BOOK

28:15.832 --> 28:17.064
YOUR INFECTION AT A TIME THAT

28:17.133 --> 28:18.933
WORKS FOR BOTH OF YOU.

28:19.002 --> 28:19.600
AND, WHILE BNSF CHANGED THAT

28:19.669 --> 28:21.269
POLICY THIS FALL, IT'S STILL IN

28:21.338 --> 28:24.038
EFFECT AT OTHER MAJOR RAILROADS.

28:24.107 --> 28:25.807
A FORMER UNION HEAD SUMS UP THE

28:25.876 --> 28:28.142
SITUATION LIKE THIS.

28:28.211 --> 28:29.177
>> AS WE SAY, YOU EITHER GO TO

28:29.246 --> 28:30.845
WORK SICK AND TIRED OR YOU GET

28:30.914 --> 28:32.713
FIRED.

28:32.782 --> 28:33.347
THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS HAS COME

28:33.416 --> 28:34.615
DOWN TO.

28:34.684 --> 28:36.684
>> John: IT'S NEVER A GOOD SIGN

28:36.753 --> 28:37.585
WHEN CONDITIONS ARE SO BLEAK,

28:37.654 --> 28:39.086
YOU'VE COME UP WITH A CATCHY

28:39.155 --> 28:40.721
LITTLE RHYME FOR IT.

28:40.790 --> 28:41.589
ALSO, NO ONE SHOULD GET FIRED

28:41.658 --> 28:44.125
FOR BEING SICK.

28:44.194 --> 28:45.159
AS FAR AS PUNISHMENTS GO FOR NOT

28:45.228 --> 28:46.494
BEING ABLE TO WORK ONE DAY, IT'S

28:46.563 --> 28:47.995
RIGHT UP THERE WITH BEING

28:48.064 --> 28:48.696
ENTOMBED IN THE TUNNEL OF

28:48.765 --> 28:51.132
PUNISHMENT.

28:51.201 --> 28:52.366
AND, HAVING SICK, TIRED WORKERS

28:52.435 --> 28:54.302
IS BAD ACROSS THE BOARD, BUT IT

28:54.371 --> 28:55.303
GETS MUCH WORSE WHEN YOU REALIZE

28:55.372 --> 28:57.872
SOME OF THOSE WORKERS ARE THE

28:57.941 --> 28:58.473
ONES WHO INSPECT THE TRAINS TO

28:58.542 --> 29:00.975
KEEP THEM SAFE.

29:01.044 --> 29:02.176
AND, THE TIME ALLOTTED FOR THAT

29:02.245 --> 29:03.644
KEEPS SHRINKING.

29:03.713 --> 29:05.780
ONE FORMER RAILROADER SAYS

29:05.849 --> 29:07.648
NORFOLK SOUTHERN'S INSPECTORS

29:07.717 --> 29:08.916
USED TO HAVE 5-8 MINUTES TO

29:08.985 --> 29:10.551
CHECK A TRAIN CAR'S WHEELS FOR

29:10.620 --> 29:12.153
PROBLEMS, LIKE LEAKY BEARINGS OR

29:12.222 --> 29:14.455
DAMAGED COMPONENTS.

29:14.524 --> 29:16.257
NOW, IT'S OFTEN BETWEEN

29:16.326 --> 29:18.025
30-SECONDS AND A MINUTE.

29:18.094 --> 29:18.659
AND, WORSE STILL, EMPLOYEES FEEL

29:18.728 --> 29:20.294
LIKE THEY CAN'T SPEAK OUT, AS A

29:20.363 --> 29:21.729
RESULT OF A PATTERN OF

29:21.798 --> 29:23.131
RETALIATION AGAINST WORKERS WHO

29:23.200 --> 29:24.232
REPORT SAFETY VIOLATIONS OR

29:24.301 --> 29:25.766
INJURIES.

29:25.835 --> 29:26.567
ONE WHISTLEBLOWER EVEN SUED HIS

29:26.636 --> 29:28.069
COMPANY, AND HAD SOME PRETTY

29:28.138 --> 29:30.438
COMPELLING EVIDENCE ON HIS SIDE.

29:30.507 --> 29:32.673
>> DON SANDERS, A FORMER BNSF

29:32.742 --> 29:35.276
TRACK INSPECTOR IN MINNESOTA,

29:35.345 --> 29:37.445
SECRETLY RECORDED CALLS WITH HIS

29:37.514 --> 29:39.680
SUPERVISOR BACK IN 2015.

29:39.749 --> 29:40.314
IN THIS RECORDING, OBTAINED BY 5

29:40.383 --> 29:41.482
INVESTIGATES, YOU'LL HEAR WHAT

29:41.551 --> 29:43.684
HAPPENED WHEN THE BOSS FOUND OUT

29:43.753 --> 29:44.418
SANDERS CALLED THE FEDERAL

29:44.487 --> 29:47.355
RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION.

29:47.424 --> 29:49.123
>> WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD WE

29:49.192 --> 29:52.260
EVER CALL FRA ABOUT ANYTHING?

29:52.329 --> 29:53.461
UNLESS I'M ABSOLUTELY BLATANTLY

29:53.530 --> 29:55.863
TELLING YOU TO BREAK RULES, OR

29:55.932 --> 30:00.067
DON'T DO SOMETHING.

30:00.136 --> 30:00.668
>> IS THAT AGAINST THE COMPANY

30:00.737 --> 30:02.203
RULES?

30:02.272 --> 30:03.638
>> IT'S NOT GOOD.

30:03.707 --> 30:04.505
>> I CALLED HIM AND ASKED HIM A

30:04.574 --> 30:05.573
QUESTION, KEITH.

30:05.642 --> 30:06.541
I DON'T UNDERSTAND --

30:06.610 --> 30:08.276
>> I DON'T WANT YOU DOING THAT.

30:08.345 --> 30:08.745
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S

30:08.812 --> 30:09.944
AUTOMATICALLY SUSPICIOUS.

30:10.013 --> 30:10.711
IF YOU WORK AT A RESTAURANT AND

30:10.780 --> 30:11.879
YOUR BOSS TELLS YOU THAT, UNDER

30:11.948 --> 30:13.214
NO CIRCUMSTANCES, SHOULD YOU

30:13.283 --> 30:14.449
EVER CALL THE HEALTH INSPECTOR,

30:14.518 --> 30:16.017
BEST CASE SCENARIO: HE IS BEING

30:16.086 --> 30:21.255
RATATOUILLED.

30:21.324 --> 30:21.889
THAT INSPECTOR WAS LATER FIRED,

30:21.958 --> 30:23.791
IN WHAT A JURY LATER AGREED WAS

30:23.860 --> 30:24.926
RETALIATION FOR REPORTING TOO

30:24.995 --> 30:26.961
MANY TRACK DEFECTS.

30:27.030 --> 30:27.595
AND, ANOTHER RAIL WORKER SUMS IT

30:27.664 --> 30:33.334
ALL UP LIKE THIS

30:33.403 --> 30:34.035
>> THE RAILROAD, PROBABLY 100

30:34.104 --> 30:35.069
YEARS AGO, CAME UP WITH SAFETY

30:35.138 --> 30:36.671
FIRST.

30:36.740 --> 30:37.872
WHEN PRECISION SCHEDULED

30:37.941 --> 30:39.774
RAILROADING CAME OUT, THEY GAVE

30:39.843 --> 30:40.741
US A LIST OF PRIORITIES THAT WE

30:40.810 --> 30:42.310
WERE TO WORK BY.

30:42.379 --> 30:44.412
SAFETY'S FOURTH.

30:44.481 --> 30:45.146
>> John: HERE'S THE THING:

30:45.215 --> 30:46.547
THAT'S TRUE!

30:46.616 --> 30:48.049
SAFETY IS FOURTH!

30:48.118 --> 30:49.851
HE'S NOT EMBELLISHING THERE.

30:49.920 --> 30:50.852
HUNTER HARRISON WOULD FREQUENTLY

30:50.921 --> 30:52.053
RUN DOWN A NUMBERED LIST OF HIS

30:52.122 --> 30:53.154
GUIDING PRINCIPLES, WHICH

30:53.223 --> 30:54.655
STARTED WITH "SERVICE," THEN

30:54.724 --> 30:55.890
"COST CONTROL," THEN "ASSET

30:55.959 --> 30:57.125
UTILIZATION," AND THEN, AND ONLY

30:57.194 --> 30:59.627
THEN, "SAFETY."

30:59.696 --> 31:00.428
IT WAS LITERALLY FOURTH ON THE

31:00.497 --> 31:03.164
LIST.

31:03.233 --> 31:04.031
AND, ONCE YOU GET PAST THREE

31:04.100 --> 31:05.266
ITEMS ON A PRIORITY LIST,

31:05.335 --> 31:06.567
ANYTHING AFTER THAT ISN'T A

31:06.636 --> 31:08.636
PRIORITY, BY DEFINITION.

31:08.705 --> 31:09.570
IT'S LIKE RANKING YOUR FAVORITE

31:09.639 --> 31:10.538
BEATLES: THERE ARE THREE YOU

31:10.607 --> 31:12.507
CARE ABOUT, AND ONE AFTERTHOUGHT

31:12.576 --> 31:13.174
WHO NARRATES SADISTIC CHILDREN'S

31:13.243 --> 31:16.844
SHOWS ABOUT ABUSED TRAINS.

31:16.913 --> 31:18.412
AND, AT ONE HEARING, WHEN

31:18.481 --> 31:20.081
HARRISON WAS RUNNING THROUGH HIS

31:20.150 --> 31:21.282
LIST AND EVENTUALLY GOT TO

31:21.351 --> 31:23.651
"SAFETY," HE WOUND UP MAKING A

31:23.720 --> 31:25.553
PRETTY STRIKING CONFESSION.

31:25.622 --> 31:31.058
>> THE FOURTH PORTION OF THIS --

31:31.127 --> 31:32.994
IS WHICH WE SOMETIMES DON'T PAY

31:33.063 --> 31:34.529
THE APPROPRIATE ATTENTION TO --

31:34.598 --> 31:35.196
IS JUST SIMPLY DON'T GET ANYBODY

31:35.265 --> 31:37.298
HURT WHILE YOU'RE DOING THIS.

31:37.367 --> 31:37.999
NOW, WE CAN BE VERY

31:38.068 --> 31:39.801
SOPHISTICATED, AND WE CAN TALK

31:39.870 --> 31:42.270
ABOUT RISK MANAGEMENT AND LOSS

31:42.339 --> 31:44.472
OF CONTROL AND PROGRAMS AND

31:44.541 --> 31:47.442
PROCESSES AND SO FORTH.

31:47.511 --> 31:50.845
I GOT BLOOD ALL OVER MY HANDS

31:50.914 --> 31:52.847
FROM INJURIES IN THIS INDUSTRY

31:52.916 --> 31:55.950
THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN AVOIDABLE.

31:56.019 --> 31:57.385
>> John: WOW.

31:57.454 --> 31:58.286
I GOTTA SAY, AFTER 10 SEASONS OF

31:58.355 --> 32:00.188
SHOWING YOU EXECUTIVES DENYING

32:00.257 --> 32:01.889
THEIR NEGLECT, THAT'S ALMOST

32:01.958 --> 32:03.424
REFRESHING.

32:03.493 --> 32:04.459
IT'S THE KIND OF HONESTY YOU

32:04.528 --> 32:06.127
ONLY USUALLY GET FROM A GUY LIKE

32:06.196 --> 32:08.029
THAT AFTER HE'S BEEN VISITED BY

32:08.098 --> 32:09.697
THE GHOSTS OF CHRISTMAS.

32:09.766 --> 32:11.032
AND LOOK: RAILWAY COMPANIES WILL

32:11.101 --> 32:13.201
TELL YOU THAT SAFETY HAS ALWAYS

32:13.270 --> 32:15.436
BEEN IMPORTANT TO THEM.

32:15.505 --> 32:16.005
AND, THEY'LL POINT OUT THAT

32:16.072 --> 32:16.904
DERAILMENTS HAVE FALLEN BY 44%

32:16.973 --> 32:20.408
SINCE 2000.

32:20.477 --> 32:22.076
WHICH IS TRUE, ALTHOUGH I'LL

32:22.145 --> 32:22.677
POINT OUT THAT SOME OF THAT IS

32:22.746 --> 32:24.278
BECAUSE WE'RE RUNNING FAR FEWER

32:24.347 --> 32:25.379
TRAINS SINCE THEN.

32:25.448 --> 32:27.081
ALSO, THE RATE OF DERAILMENTS

32:27.150 --> 32:28.316
FOR LARGE RAILROADS HAS BEEN

32:28.385 --> 32:29.717
CREEPING UP AGAIN IN RECENT

32:29.786 --> 32:31.185
YEARS.

32:31.254 --> 32:32.253
ONE RAILWAY VETERAN DESCRIBES A

32:32.322 --> 32:33.888
MAJOR CRASH AS JUST A MATTER OF

32:33.957 --> 32:35.590
TIME, FEARING "THERE'S GOING TO

32:35.659 --> 32:37.058
BE A FREIGHT CAR THAT HASN'T

32:37.127 --> 32:38.726
BEEN INSPECTED IN 90,000 MILES

32:38.795 --> 32:40.495
THAT COMES OFF THE TRACK, AND

32:40.564 --> 32:41.262
EITHER EXPLODES OR LEAKS

32:41.331 --> 32:42.897
POISONOUS GAS OUT.

32:42.966 --> 32:44.065
IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOMETHING

32:44.134 --> 32:45.366
LIKE THAT, AND A LOT OF DEATHS,

32:45.435 --> 32:47.168
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN

32:47.237 --> 32:49.003
EVERYBODY'S GOING TO CARE."

32:49.072 --> 32:49.837
YOU'VE NOW HEARD THAT EXACT

32:49.906 --> 32:51.739
SENTIMENT MULTIPLE TIMES IN THIS

32:51.808 --> 32:57.578
PIECE, AND HE'S PROBABLY RIGHT.
