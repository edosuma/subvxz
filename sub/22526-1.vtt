00:56.554 --> 00:57.756
Welcome back.

00:57.789 --> 01:00.292
We are broadcasting live
from Seattle

01:00.326 --> 01:01.727
to give you the moment
you've been waiting for

01:01.759 --> 01:03.195
all summer long.

01:04.763 --> 01:06.099
Two contestants remain,

01:06.132 --> 01:08.501
but only one will be.

01:08.534 --> 01:10.837
<i>Married to a Millionaire.</i>

01:12.337 --> 01:13.738
Well, it was just a couple
of months ago

01:13.772 --> 01:16.375
that I asked your ten suitors
one question.

01:16.408 --> 01:18.578
How far would you go
for the one you love?

01:20.146 --> 01:22.448
Who do you want to spend
the rest of your life with?

01:22.480 --> 01:25.184
Brandi or Jessica?

01:26.284 --> 01:28.787
Jessica, we're just not made
for each other.

01:28.820 --> 01:30.222
I've decided to go with Brandi!

01:30.256 --> 01:31.524
Brandi!

01:31.557 --> 01:33.192
It's Brandi!

01:34.325 --> 01:36.228
I am the happiest man alive.

01:36.262 --> 01:37.829
And I'm the luckiest girl.

01:37.862 --> 01:39.364
We'll take you down
to the church,

01:39.397 --> 01:41.233
where both of your families
are waiting for you.

01:41.266 --> 01:42.634
Come on.

01:47.572 --> 01:48.573
No, no, no, no!

01:50.209 --> 01:51.811
You slut!

01:51.843 --> 01:53.646
What'd you do?
Suck his small dick?

01:53.679 --> 01:54.647
No, hey!

01:54.680 --> 01:56.449
Move!
- I'm not gonna do that!

01:57.683 --> 01:59.719
Put the gun down.
Put it down!

01:59.751 --> 02:01.620
Oh, my God!

02:01.653 --> 02:03.789
Somebody get over here!

02:05.623 --> 02:07.492
<i>...not sure
what happened there.</i>

02:07.525 --> 02:09.360
<i>We will, of course, let you
know as soon as we find out.</i>

02:09.395 --> 02:12.365
<i>Alex Jones here, reporting on the tragic
shooting death live on television.</i>

02:12.397 --> 02:14.667
<i>Tragic news. BC's Married</i>
- to a Millionaire.

02:14.699 --> 02:17.202
<i>- Two are reported dead...
- ...gunned down in front...</i>

02:17.235 --> 02:20.338
<i>...Adam Rogers dove on top
to shield, an act of heroism...</i>

02:20.372 --> 02:22.608
<i>...host Adam Rogers displayed
unbelievable bravery...</i>

02:22.640 --> 02:24.276
<i>I'm remorseful, she was sick.</i>

02:24.310 --> 02:27.513
Yeah, can you say it like
you mean it, please?

02:27.545 --> 02:29.481
I'm sorry.

02:29.514 --> 02:31.183
I'm remorseful, she was sick.

02:31.217 --> 02:33.586
Nobody knew it.
- Good. You're a hero.

02:33.618 --> 02:34.819
All right.
- You'll be fine.

02:34.853 --> 02:37.557
Please welcome Adam Rogers.

02:37.590 --> 02:39.893
Take your
hands out of your pockets!

02:41.492 --> 02:45.364
How does it feel to be
a national hero?

02:45.396 --> 02:49.868
Oh, uh... no,
I...

02:49.901 --> 02:51.269
I'm no hero, I was just...

02:51.304 --> 02:53.906
I was just doing what anybody would
have done under those circumstances.

02:53.938 --> 02:56.241
Well, most people
would have ducked.

02:57.508 --> 02:59.477
Now, what was going
through your mind

02:59.510 --> 03:03.615
when you first heard
the gunshots?

03:03.649 --> 03:04.717
Honestly?

03:04.750 --> 03:06.252
Yes, honestly.

03:06.284 --> 03:08.820
<i>We're all about honesty
on Morning Show USA.</i>

03:12.890 --> 03:17.295
Honestly, I was thinking about...
my job,

03:17.329 --> 03:19.866
and what a giant mess this
was gonna cause our network.

03:21.667 --> 03:24.637
Here I was, lying next to a man
that had just been murdered

03:24.669 --> 03:26.972
and all I could think
about was myself.

03:27.006 --> 03:28.007
It was not your fault.

03:28.039 --> 03:30.709
Actually, it was my fault.

03:30.742 --> 03:33.912
And... it was your fault,

03:33.945 --> 03:35.213
and it was our network's fault,

03:35.247 --> 03:39.618
and it was the millions of people
who tune in each week's fault.

03:39.651 --> 03:43.256
...bring us to top five
Tuesdays through Fridays.

03:43.288 --> 03:45.590
I know you want to see
the numbers for your ads, so--

03:45.623 --> 03:48.561
There's a problem.

03:48.593 --> 03:49.794
Excuse me for a moment.

03:49.828 --> 03:50.997
Rogers is going rogue.

03:51.030 --> 03:53.899
Director wants permission
to pull the plug.

03:53.931 --> 03:57.335
We're sitting here
celebrating me...

03:57.368 --> 04:00.973
trying to cover the fact that we
pitted two women against each other

04:01.006 --> 04:03.808
like a couple of fucking dogs.

04:03.842 --> 04:05.278
Uh, right.

04:06.878 --> 04:08.881
<i>What happened on my show,
that was not an accident.</i>

04:08.913 --> 04:10.615
<i>That was...
that was inevitable.</i>

04:10.649 --> 04:12.350
Okay, my little man.

04:12.383 --> 04:14.887
Shh, quiet!

04:14.919 --> 04:18.024
<i>There it is, a desperate rage
festering in this country</i>

04:18.057 --> 04:19.824
<i>and we're too afraid
to show it to you.</i>

04:19.858 --> 04:21.394
<i>Instead we numb ourselves</i>

04:21.427 --> 04:23.796
<i>with our stupid fucking
morning shows</i>

04:23.829 --> 04:27.800
<i>and soap operas
and reality shows.</i>

04:27.833 --> 04:29.602
<i>- It's disgusting.
- Holy crap.</i>

04:29.634 --> 04:31.504
Isn't that your brother?

04:31.536 --> 04:34.606
<i>I'm going to have to stop
you now, ok? That was--</i>

04:34.639 --> 04:37.075
<i>I was told to come out here and
say that Jessica was sick...</i>

04:37.108 --> 04:39.444
<i>Yes. - And that it was just
a game, but I can't do that.</i>

04:39.478 --> 04:40.745
<i>Jessica was not sick.</i>

04:40.778 --> 04:42.781
She was a beautiful human being

04:42.814 --> 04:46.351
under an incredible amount
of pressure and personal debt

04:46.384 --> 04:49.288
and we played with her heart
for our own financial gain.

04:51.122 --> 04:53.091
<i>Okay, Adam, you know what?
That was great--</i>

04:53.125 --> 04:55.060
<i>- Let it play out.
- I have to stop you now, okay?</i>

04:55.093 --> 04:56.896
And I'm glad that
people saw that.

04:56.928 --> 05:00.332
That is the most reality
reality TV has ever shown

05:00.365 --> 05:01.866
and I hope that we
show more of it.

05:01.899 --> 05:04.402
Well, I guess you're
in the minority there.

05:04.435 --> 05:07.339
We should show more of that.
- Okay, are we-- are we still live?

05:07.372 --> 05:10.642
All right, we'll be right
back after these messages

05:10.675 --> 05:13.378
with America's cutest puppies.

05:13.411 --> 05:14.479
Thank you.

05:18.083 --> 05:20.786
What the fuck, man?
- I'm sorry.

05:20.819 --> 05:22.655
What he fuck are you doing?
- It was nice to meet you.

05:47.446 --> 05:49.882
Hey.
- Hey.

05:49.915 --> 05:51.817
I am so fucking fired.

05:51.850 --> 05:53.052
Good.

05:53.084 --> 05:54.120
You're too good for that job.

05:54.153 --> 05:56.088
You should go back to school.
I'll help you study.

05:56.120 --> 05:58.022
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

05:58.055 --> 06:01.159
You got me back on my feet,
I'll get you back on your feet.

06:01.192 --> 06:03.895
Yeah, I don't think so.

06:03.928 --> 06:06.564
What the hell did I do?

06:06.598 --> 06:07.699
What did I do?

06:11.670 --> 06:13.139
You know what you did?

06:13.172 --> 06:15.408
You told the truth, Adam.

06:17.576 --> 06:19.945
I haven't seen that guy
in a long time.

06:19.978 --> 06:21.913
I am proud of you.

06:21.947 --> 06:23.716
Mom and dad would have
been proud of you, too.

06:23.749 --> 06:26.752
Yeah, I bet mom and dad
would have been real proud.

06:26.785 --> 06:29.155
A TV hack and a
recovering pill-head.

06:29.187 --> 06:30.757
It's Nurse Pill-Head
to you.

06:32.089 --> 06:34.125
I'm going back to the hospital.
- I'm sorry.

06:34.158 --> 06:36.161
It's okay, it's okay.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Hey.

06:38.463 --> 06:39.865
How're you doing?
- I'm good.

06:39.898 --> 06:42.568
Good.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.737
Let me grab your...

06:46.538 --> 06:47.739
What? No.
No, no, no.

06:47.773 --> 06:50.475
Adam, that's not what I'm here for.
- We had a deal.

06:50.509 --> 06:52.845
You pay off your debt
and I pay your expenses.

06:52.877 --> 06:54.079
Hold on.
- No. Nope, not cool.

06:54.112 --> 06:56.115
Hey, a deal's a deal. Come
here, come here, come here.

06:56.148 --> 06:57.417
Take it.

07:01.954 --> 07:03.189
Thank you.

07:03.221 --> 07:04.656
You're welcome.
- I love you.

07:04.689 --> 07:06.826
I love you, too, honey.

07:09.728 --> 07:10.896
You're okay.

07:12.764 --> 07:14.133
Say it again.

07:15.766 --> 07:19.538
You're okay, Adam Rogers.
All right.

07:25.244 --> 07:27.613
<i>Hey, this is Adam.
Leave a message please.</i>

07:27.646 --> 07:29.215
<i>Ilana Katzenberg here.</i>

07:29.247 --> 07:30.415
<i>Nice rant this morning.</i>

07:30.449 --> 07:33.586
<i>Be at the network office
tomorrow, 9am sharp--</i>

07:42.827 --> 07:46.197
It seems like we're working the
same hours, Miss Katzenberg.

07:46.230 --> 07:49.634
Yeah, except I start
at 8:30 again.

07:51.536 --> 07:54.039
Shoot.
Yeah, me too.

07:56.173 --> 07:57.175
What's your name again?

07:58.610 --> 08:01.146
Um, Mason.

08:01.178 --> 08:03.048
Mason Washington, ma'am.

08:03.081 --> 08:05.584
Two jobs.
- Yeah.

08:05.617 --> 08:07.620
And looking for a third.

08:07.653 --> 08:10.289
You aren't hiring an appliance
salesman by any chance, are you?

08:10.322 --> 08:11.423
No.

08:11.456 --> 08:13.259
I was number one in the
South Bay, 15 years over.

08:13.291 --> 08:14.926
"House to fill?
Just call Bill at--."

08:14.959 --> 08:17.061
You worked at Angel
City Appliance!

08:17.095 --> 08:19.799
You know it?
- I bought my fridge and stove there.

08:21.699 --> 08:23.902
I was there for three decades.

08:23.935 --> 08:26.838
Then online shopping came along,

08:26.872 --> 08:28.607
and then the recession,

08:28.639 --> 08:30.108
and now it seems that
nobody wants to hire

08:30.141 --> 08:33.211
a 55-year-old
with insufferable charm.

08:33.245 --> 08:34.913
I don't know why.

08:36.615 --> 08:38.817
Uh, I should get back to work.

08:42.187 --> 08:44.056
Do you watch television, Mason?

08:44.089 --> 08:45.791
Me?

08:45.823 --> 08:47.692
Oh, uh... no,
not much, honestly.

08:47.725 --> 08:49.260
<i>How about Married
to a Millionaire?</i>

08:49.293 --> 08:50.361
No, ma'am.

08:50.394 --> 08:54.567
<i>But my son did show me the
video on Morning USA.</i>

08:54.600 --> 08:55.935
Oh, so you know what happened?

08:55.967 --> 08:57.536
Yeah.
- So what do you think?

08:58.803 --> 09:00.305
You can't fire me, can you?

09:00.339 --> 09:03.309
Probably.
But I won't.

09:04.875 --> 09:07.312
I think he was
speaking the truth.

09:07.346 --> 09:09.749
You don't see too much
of that lately.

09:11.783 --> 09:13.019
I agree.

09:20.958 --> 09:22.360
Jerry.

09:22.394 --> 09:23.629
Jerry, please.
Look. Look.

09:23.662 --> 09:25.163
I know we talked about this,

09:25.197 --> 09:27.231
but I'm four hours away
from being full-time.

09:27.264 --> 09:29.516
I can do the hours
anywhere you want.

09:29.517 --> 09:32.037
West end, downtown, Valley,
Orange County, I don't care.

09:32.070 --> 09:34.340
You know how badly my family
needs the health benefits.

09:34.373 --> 09:36.742
I'm sorry, but I've got
no more hours to give.

09:36.774 --> 09:38.343
All right?
We're stretched thin.

09:38.376 --> 09:40.579
We can't be stretched that thin.

09:45.017 --> 09:46.719
All right.

09:46.751 --> 09:48.120
G'night.

10:32.330 --> 10:33.699
Shit.

10:47.446 --> 10:49.148
<i>How about this Adam Rogers?</i>

10:49.181 --> 10:50.682
<i>What a story, I tell you--</i>

10:54.385 --> 10:55.820
Daddy!

10:55.854 --> 10:57.855
'Morning, angel.

10:57.889 --> 10:59.191
Did you get
a good night's sleep?

10:59.224 --> 11:00.392
Did you eat your breakfast?

11:00.424 --> 11:01.826
Did you brush your teeth?

11:01.860 --> 11:04.329
Oooh...
Uh-uh, you fibber!

11:04.361 --> 11:08.166
Hey, go brush your teeth. Daddy
will drive you to school.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.169
Hey, watch yourself,
you little twerp.

11:10.201 --> 11:11.403
Derrick called me a twerp!

11:11.436 --> 11:13.673
Yeah, I heard him.
He'll apologize.

11:15.139 --> 11:17.775
'Morning, slugger.

11:17.808 --> 11:20.445
Who were those suits
at the door?

11:20.479 --> 11:21.980
Derrick, grab your breakfast.

11:22.013 --> 11:25.850
Your dad will drive you
to school.

11:53.144 --> 11:56.781
What happened on your show
this week was disastrous.

11:56.815 --> 11:58.917
But-- but,

11:58.950 --> 12:02.287
from a legal standpoint,
surprisingly neither the network

12:02.320 --> 12:05.424
nor the producers
could be held liable.

12:05.456 --> 12:07.960
Yeah, I know.
But here's the thing.

12:07.993 --> 12:11.430
When it comes to the murder,
the FCC allows live broadcasts

12:11.462 --> 12:14.098
to air unforeseen
criminal content

12:14.131 --> 12:17.001
as long as it wasn't planned,
there was security in place,

12:17.034 --> 12:19.270
and every effort was made
to kill the feed.

12:19.303 --> 12:20.505
All of which we can prove.

12:20.538 --> 12:22.473
When it comes to the suicide,

12:22.506 --> 12:23.942
that's where it gets
a little interesting.

12:25.210 --> 12:27.846
Oh, I'm sorry.
- I must have the wrong-- - Sit, Sylvia.

12:27.879 --> 12:29.214
Everyone, this is
Sylvia Rowland,

12:29.246 --> 12:32.850
three-time Emmy-winning producer
of our live broadcast

12:32.884 --> 12:35.486
<i>of Snow White, Peter Pan
and The Wizard.</i>

12:35.519 --> 12:37.456
Sylvia, everyone.
Continue.

12:37.489 --> 12:40.793
As I was saying, when it
comes to Jessica's suicide,

12:40.826 --> 12:41.927
a case could be made

12:41.961 --> 12:43.861
that no one tried to stop her
from killing herself.

12:43.894 --> 12:46.965
A small one, I know,
but a case nonetheless.

12:46.998 --> 12:48.867
But unlike murder,

12:48.899 --> 12:51.336
suicide is not a felony
in the United States.

12:51.369 --> 12:55.340
So therefore, if we can prove
that no one did anything

12:55.373 --> 12:57.376
to aid or abet her
in her actions,

12:57.408 --> 13:00.144
we are off the hook.

13:00.177 --> 13:01.980
I, uh-- I have a question,
Bernie.

13:02.013 --> 13:04.283
Forget the murder for a second.

13:04.316 --> 13:06.185
What if we hypothetically knew

13:06.217 --> 13:08.486
Jessica was gonna
commit suicide on air?

13:08.519 --> 13:12.024
Well, hypothetically, if we knew
she was gonna kill herself

13:12.057 --> 13:14.860
and no one did anything
to aid or abet her--

13:14.893 --> 13:17.329
You mean by handing her the gun?

13:17.361 --> 13:18.629
Yeah, correct.

13:18.663 --> 13:21.533
Unless, of course, there was a
physician on hand doing it.

13:21.566 --> 13:22.434
Well, yes.

13:22.466 --> 13:25.870
Suicide law is
a state-by-state issue.

13:25.903 --> 13:28.539
I mean, in California
the End of Life Option Act

13:28.572 --> 13:31.275
allows physicians
to supervise people

13:31.308 --> 13:34.379
who are deemed mentally sound to
take their own lives.

13:34.412 --> 13:36.248
At first it was just
for the terminally ill,

13:36.280 --> 13:37.315
but...
- But?

13:37.349 --> 13:40.018
But there was a constitutional
challenge this year.

13:40.051 --> 13:42.421
Proposition 426.

13:42.453 --> 13:45.122
Now all you have to be
is mentally sound

13:45.155 --> 13:47.191
and you can kill yourself
any way you deem fit.

13:47.225 --> 13:48.393
So, theoretically,

13:48.426 --> 13:51.028
if we had a show on air where
people committed suicide,

13:51.062 --> 13:53.465
and we had a doctor, let's say
a psychiatrist, on hand,

13:53.498 --> 13:55.234
we wouldn't be breaking the law.

13:55.267 --> 13:56.335
Are you actually being
serious right now?

13:56.368 --> 13:58.637
All right, I'm sorry,
but can I ask why I'm here?

13:58.669 --> 14:01.906
Ilana, are we talking
theoretics here or actual?

14:01.940 --> 14:04.076
Because if we're talking actual,

14:04.109 --> 14:07.079
as your legal counsel I strongly
advise you against pursuing this.

14:07.111 --> 14:09.514
I mean, the FCC
will have a field day!

14:09.547 --> 14:12.183
Not if you put it on
after 10 o'clock, right?

14:12.216 --> 14:13.552
Jesus Christ.

14:13.585 --> 14:15.254
I thought I was coming here
to get fired today.

14:15.287 --> 14:17.189
Yeah, and I thought I was
coming here to pitch a show.

14:17.221 --> 14:20.292
Everyone, go.
Adam, Sylvia, stay.

14:21.458 --> 14:22.460
Thank you, Bernie.

14:24.395 --> 14:25.630
All right, let's go.

14:27.197 --> 14:29.134
All right, I'm sorry, but
you can't be serious.

14:29.167 --> 14:30.569
I guess I shouldn't
be surprised.

14:30.601 --> 14:34.639
Adam, you caused quite a
stir in this country.

14:34.673 --> 14:38.043
Your heroics combined with
your oratorical prowess

14:38.076 --> 14:39.610
made us the number one network

14:39.644 --> 14:42.246
for the first time
in two decades.

14:42.279 --> 14:43.380
As president of
network programming,

14:43.414 --> 14:46.384
it's my job to make sure you
aren't a flash in the pan.

14:47.485 --> 14:49.520
By watching people
kill themselves on national TV?

14:51.155 --> 14:52.690
Are you out of your mind?
- Thank you!

14:52.724 --> 14:56.228
And Sylvia, you are the best
live producer in the world.

14:56.260 --> 15:00.164
We are fortunate enough to contractually
have you for one more show.

15:00.197 --> 15:02.167
Yes, a live theatrical show.

15:02.200 --> 15:03.669
Not a live death porn show.

15:03.701 --> 15:05.570
Well, actually your
contract defines "show"

15:05.602 --> 15:07.338
as single or event series.

15:07.371 --> 15:10.074
This qualifies
as an event series.

15:10.107 --> 15:11.542
Oh, I'm sorry, but...

15:11.576 --> 15:15.279
Fuck you, and fuck this.

15:15.312 --> 15:17.649
You're under contract, Sylvia.

15:17.682 --> 15:20.018
What are you doing?

15:20.051 --> 15:23.522
Don't worry about her,
she'll come around.

15:23.554 --> 15:25.156
The question is:
Will you?

15:25.190 --> 15:28.126
You're too good for this
network, Adam, I know.

15:28.158 --> 15:32.096
<i>We're in the shmattah business
and you're done with that.</i>

15:32.129 --> 15:34.298
I also realize that on the
surface this sounds like a--

15:34.331 --> 15:35.701
Like a gimmick.

15:35.734 --> 15:37.302
But I want you to know

15:37.335 --> 15:40.405
that everything you said
yesterday was true.

15:40.437 --> 15:43.574
People are angry.
They're fed up.

15:43.607 --> 15:45.443
They wanna see something real.

15:45.476 --> 15:49.380
So, let's show them
something real.

15:52.384 --> 15:55.387
I just watched two people
die in front of me.

15:55.419 --> 15:57.621
I prefer not to see
any more of that.

15:57.654 --> 15:59.158
Have a nice day.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.402
How'd the interview go?

16:16.041 --> 16:17.275
Extraordinary.

16:17.307 --> 16:19.444
They hired a 20-year-old.

16:21.479 --> 16:23.014
Oh, Mason.

16:23.048 --> 16:25.049
Oh, you know, it's all right.

16:25.082 --> 16:27.318
I mean, it wasn't meant
for me anyway.

16:27.351 --> 16:28.687
Those men that came
to the house.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.622
They're from the bank.

16:30.654 --> 16:33.125
You told me we were a bit
behind on the mortgage,

16:33.158 --> 16:36.728
but you didn't tell me
we were five months behind.

16:36.760 --> 16:39.331
They can come and take our
house any time they want,

16:39.364 --> 16:40.232
you know that, right?

16:40.264 --> 16:42.167
Rebecca--
- And it's not just them.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.269
Collectors been calling
every day, Mason.

16:44.302 --> 16:46.204
So don't pick up.
- I'm not pickin' up!

16:46.236 --> 16:47.371
Look, what do you
want me to say?

16:47.404 --> 16:49.707
I'm paying the water bills,
I'm paying the electric bills,

16:49.740 --> 16:51.509
I'm payin' for gas,
I'm payin' for insurance,

16:51.543 --> 16:53.245
I'm trying to pay
for Derrick's medical,

16:53.278 --> 16:54.678
and I'm payin' for groceries.

16:54.711 --> 16:56.581
Are you done?

16:56.614 --> 16:59.418
'Cause I gotta go to work to
help pay for everything else.

16:59.451 --> 17:02.388
The clothing, the books,
the birthday presents.

17:06.490 --> 17:08.826
We worked so hard
to get our kids

17:08.858 --> 17:11.529
into a good neighborhood
with a good school district.

17:13.431 --> 17:16.567
<i>I am not gonna let that
be taken away from them.</i>

17:26.510 --> 17:29.247
<i>...more than Indiana,
the condition of compuls--</i>

17:29.279 --> 17:31.549
<i>...go back to France, because 99
percent of the country hates you!</i>

17:31.583 --> 17:32.817
<i>...accept that,
that's fine.</i>

17:32.851 --> 17:35.120
<i>I think it's stupid
what you're saying.</i>

17:35.153 --> 17:37.655
<i>So what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to accept it.</i>

17:37.689 --> 17:38.990
<i>But FOX News has been right!</i>

17:39.023 --> 17:40.625
<i>Yeah, I just didn't
think people wanted a dialogue.</i>

17:40.659 --> 17:44.129
<i>No, no, no. That's fine, right?
I mean, am I right?</i>

17:44.162 --> 17:47.164
<i>Are we at the presidential
level, or is he punching down?</i>

17:47.198 --> 17:49.367
<i>Welcome to the season premiere
of Married to a Millionaire.</i>

17:49.400 --> 17:50.401
<i>My name is Adam Rogers</i>

17:50.434 --> 17:53.337
<i>and we have just met
our wealthy man.</i>

17:53.371 --> 17:56.208
<i>Why don't we meet our suitors?
Hi, what's your name?</i>

17:56.240 --> 17:59.677
<i>Hi, I'm Jessica,
I'm a dental hygienist.</i>

17:59.711 --> 18:03.615
<i>I love writing, swimming,
and romantic dinners.</i>

18:03.647 --> 18:06.750
<i>- Okay. And your name?
- Hi, I'm Brandi, I'm a physiotherapist.</i>

18:06.784 --> 18:09.488
<i>I like traveling, surfing,
and hot dogs.</i>

18:09.520 --> 18:12.890
<i>Okay. Hot dogs.
I like hot dogs.</i>

18:12.923 --> 18:14.625
<i>- Only vegan.
- Okay.</i>

18:14.659 --> 18:15.927
<i>Brandi, Jessica,</i>

18:15.961 --> 18:18.730
<i>do you feel like you're
marriage material for John?</i>

18:18.762 --> 18:21.532
<i>- Hell yeah!
- Fuck.</i>

18:34.311 --> 18:35.546
<i>Brandi!</i>

18:40.617 --> 18:41.619
<i>Move!</i>

20:17.015 --> 20:18.416
How are you?

20:18.449 --> 20:21.720
Uh, she can't see you right now.

20:21.752 --> 20:24.021
Uh, look. She's--
Hey. Cut me a break, man.

20:24.055 --> 20:25.789
I can't let you in there--
- Just give me a second.

20:25.823 --> 20:28.393
I'm telling you,
you can't--

20:30.528 --> 20:33.431
I'm done exploiting people
for the sake of ratings,

20:33.463 --> 20:35.933
and I am done being the
mouthpiece for garbage.

20:35.967 --> 20:36.935
<i>Excuse me?</i>

20:36.968 --> 20:38.903
<i>Ilana, what's going on
over there?</i>

20:38.935 --> 20:40.605
I'm on a call with our entire
board of directors.

20:40.637 --> 20:41.807
Can this wait?

20:46.411 --> 20:49.581
I don't wanna do a show
that affirms death.

20:49.614 --> 20:50.682
We gotta do better than that.

20:50.714 --> 20:52.283
I wanna do a show
that affirms life,

20:52.317 --> 20:53.919
that challenges people,
that stands for something.

20:55.619 --> 20:57.421
Okay.

20:57.454 --> 21:00.357
But people will die if we go
ahead with this, you know.

21:00.391 --> 21:01.459
Yeah, I know.

21:01.491 --> 21:04.561
But I don't want them
dying in vain.

21:04.595 --> 21:07.432
Now if...
if I do this show,

21:07.464 --> 21:09.900
and if people are
actually going to die,

21:09.933 --> 21:11.502
I want them to die
for a good reason,

21:11.536 --> 21:12.703
a higher purpose.

21:12.737 --> 21:15.774
I want this show to teach
people how to live,

21:15.807 --> 21:17.608
to appreciate what we've got,

21:17.642 --> 21:20.312
to foster empathy.

21:20.345 --> 21:22.579
And it's not gonna be
about fame or money,

21:22.613 --> 21:25.583
and we are not gonna be
bribing guests to come on.

21:25.615 --> 21:27.585
They will come
of their own volition.

21:27.617 --> 21:29.486
And if that doesn't work?

21:29.519 --> 21:31.990
Everybody has a story,
they just...

21:32.022 --> 21:34.625
they just want to be heard.

21:34.659 --> 21:36.728
What do you want?

21:36.760 --> 21:39.530
I want a say in set design
and show structure,

21:39.564 --> 21:41.599
and I want complete control
of the message--

21:41.632 --> 21:44.736
Adam--
- It's non-negotiable.

21:44.769 --> 21:46.938
You're using me.

21:46.971 --> 21:49.574
And I want to be perfectly clear

21:49.606 --> 21:51.710
that I'm gonna be
using you, too.

21:53.377 --> 21:55.879
You need ratings.
I need a platform.

21:55.913 --> 21:58.950
This is not gonna be
a circus act, Ilana.

21:58.982 --> 22:00.951
This is gonna be shocking.

22:00.984 --> 22:03.687
And real.

22:03.721 --> 22:05.390
And it'll probably
get us both fired.

22:08.859 --> 22:10.695
Sounds good to me.

22:12.730 --> 22:13.832
Okay.

22:15.799 --> 22:19.604
Let's move these LED walls
downstage and put in the stairs,

22:19.636 --> 22:22.374
and bring the five-line
up in the service.

22:24.875 --> 22:29.646
And hey, let's-- let's bring
these seats all the way...

22:29.680 --> 22:30.781
all the way up to here.

22:30.815 --> 22:32.817
I wanna feel the audience
right on top of the stage.

22:32.849 --> 22:35.119
Where will the cameras go?

22:36.586 --> 22:37.922
I'm gonna need at least ten feet

22:37.954 --> 22:40.424
for three operators
and a jib arm.

22:40.458 --> 22:42.694
Plus do you think they're gonna let
someone walk on stage with a gun,

22:42.727 --> 22:44.496
no barrier
to the audience? No.

22:44.528 --> 22:46.765
You're gonna need a bullet-proof
partition built around the stage

22:46.798 --> 22:48.633
and I want separate entrances
from the parking lot,

22:48.665 --> 22:50.934
so no one behind that wall
can get into the audience.

22:50.968 --> 22:53.037
Who is in charge here?
You or him?

22:53.069 --> 22:55.773
I am.

22:55.807 --> 22:56.908
I am.

22:56.942 --> 22:59.109
It's not about death,
but it is about ratings.

22:59.143 --> 23:02.646
The idea here is
to have people wake up.

23:05.549 --> 23:06.717
He looks like a serial killer.

23:06.750 --> 23:08.086
Do we need serial killer?

23:08.118 --> 23:09.586
Well, he can serial
kill himself.

23:09.619 --> 23:11.855
We're making this
network relevant.

23:11.888 --> 23:12.656
You cannot forget.

23:12.690 --> 23:14.692
Can we order some pizza, please?

23:14.724 --> 23:18.663
This is where I wanna start,
what's next... nope.

23:18.695 --> 23:20.932
And we're gonna need to work
on these screens here, right?

23:36.180 --> 23:38.716
What are we doing here?

23:38.749 --> 23:40.151
What are we doing here?
- Mm-hmm.

23:40.183 --> 23:43.721
Uh... we're making a show.

23:43.753 --> 23:45.589
You know what I mean.

23:47.491 --> 23:49.493
We're giving television the
kick in the ass that it needs.

23:49.527 --> 23:50.694
That's what we're doing here.

23:50.728 --> 23:53.131
We're challenging people to get
up and stand for something.

23:53.163 --> 23:54.499
And what is that? Death?

23:54.531 --> 23:57.868
No. No, Sylvia.
Life.

24:00.738 --> 24:03.641
It's not just a show
about death.

24:03.673 --> 24:05.943
<i>You do know that no one
at the network</i>

24:05.977 --> 24:09.147
gives a shit about your message, right?
- Yeah.

24:09.180 --> 24:13.116
They just want shock and awe
and blood and pyrotechnics.

24:13.150 --> 24:14.384
Yeah, I know. I know,

24:14.417 --> 24:18.756
but I think that we can create a
scenario where everybody wins.

24:20.590 --> 24:22.526
God, I want to believe you.

24:22.559 --> 24:23.861
You know, for a reality
show veteran,

24:23.894 --> 24:26.698
you are impressively naive.

24:26.730 --> 24:31.502
Yeah? Well, for a woman who
tells fairytales for a living,

24:31.536 --> 24:33.671
your lack of imagination
is quite sad.

24:37.807 --> 24:38.977
Knock 'em dead, kiddo.

24:40.978 --> 24:42.779
Really?

24:42.813 --> 24:44.215
Let's have a good show,
everybody.

24:44.248 --> 24:46.518
Stand by VTU.

24:48.885 --> 24:52.057
On in five, four, three...

24:55.159 --> 24:56.895
Cue graphics and music.
Cue camera one.

24:58.095 --> 25:02.600
<i>Live from Los Angeles,
This Is Your Death!</i>

25:02.633 --> 25:06.738
<i>And now, your host, Adam Rogers!</i>

25:09.773 --> 25:13.577
Ladies and gentlemen...

25:13.611 --> 25:16.281
What you're about to see tonight

25:16.314 --> 25:18.917
is unlike anything you've seen
on television before.

25:20.617 --> 25:24.655
But let me be clear about
one thing straight off the top.

25:24.689 --> 25:28.660
This is not a stunt,
this is not a joke-

25:28.692 --> 25:29.993
He's off script.
Hold the prompter.

25:30.027 --> 25:32.197
This is not a prank.

25:34.699 --> 25:39.304
And this will probably
shock you, and that's okay.

25:39.336 --> 25:42.307
Because on this show
we're all about transparency.

25:44.008 --> 25:46.210
Now, despite what most
networks want you to believe,

25:46.242 --> 25:48.745
your television is not there to
coddle you,

25:48.778 --> 25:50.847
nor is it there to provide
mindless escapism.

25:50.881 --> 25:53.317
What is going on?
- He's ad-libbing, is what's going on.

25:53.351 --> 25:55.687
Is this a surprise?
- All right, get me in his ear.

25:57.954 --> 25:59.691
Adam, get on script.

25:59.723 --> 26:02.759
<i>It's a liability issue and we
signed off on the warning.</i>

26:02.792 --> 26:03.960
Long before the Internet...

26:03.993 --> 26:06.063
Okay, he's moving. Let's follow him.
- Your TV...

26:06.096 --> 26:09.267
Son of a bitch.
- Was invented to connect us,

26:09.299 --> 26:10.335
to bring us together,

26:10.367 --> 26:13.771
to create a shared communal
experience, and now...

26:15.940 --> 26:18.043
<i>now all it does is lie to you.</i>

26:20.010 --> 26:21.778
<i>But we're about to change
that tonight.</i>

26:21.811 --> 26:27.217
Cue audience applause.

26:30.253 --> 26:34.024
I could explain to you what's
gonna happen next, but it's...

26:34.057 --> 26:35.859
it's probably best
just to show you.

26:35.893 --> 26:39.230
Introducing our first guest
ever...

26:39.262 --> 26:41.198
<i>- This is Sara Hickey.
- Cue VCR.</i>

26:41.231 --> 26:43.267
From Hope Township, New Jersey.
Have a look.

26:43.299 --> 26:46.870
<i>Stage lights.</i>

26:46.903 --> 26:50.107
<i>I married Bill
when I was very young.</i>

26:50.141 --> 26:53.076
<i>He was sweet and charming,</i>

26:53.109 --> 26:55.979
<i>told funny jokes.</i>

26:56.012 --> 26:58.148
<i>He reminded me of my father.</i>

26:59.983 --> 27:02.086
<i>Which was probably a bad thing.</i>

27:03.386 --> 27:07.024
<i>It wasn't long before Bill
became violent towards me.</i>

27:09.125 --> 27:10.961
<i>But things got much worse...</i>

27:14.464 --> 27:19.303
<i>when Bill began
molesting Emily...</i>

27:21.806 --> 27:23.842
<i>our daughter.</i>

27:25.076 --> 27:29.146
<i>I tried leaving him, trust me.</i>

27:30.948 --> 27:33.018
<i>It's impossible when there's
no money for a new life.</i>

27:35.786 --> 27:38.789
<i>But I'll know that
I made an effort</i>

27:38.823 --> 27:41.926
<i>to rescue my little girl.</i>

27:41.959 --> 27:44.229
<i>How will
your suicide rescue her?</i>

27:46.130 --> 27:47.399
<i>You'll see.</i>

27:48.833 --> 27:50.902
<i>Cue applause.</i>

27:52.936 --> 27:55.072
Ladies and gentlemen.

27:55.105 --> 27:57.942
After tonight,

27:57.974 --> 28:00.844
Sara Hickey ill never have
a chance at a new life.

28:04.815 --> 28:06.250
But her daughter could.

28:08.885 --> 28:10.221
With your aid.

28:11.955 --> 28:15.959
If you'd like to donate money
to Emily Hickey,

28:15.992 --> 28:18.829
please text the number that
will soon appear on your screen.

28:18.863 --> 28:21.265
Number? We don't-- we don't have a number.
We never discussed this.

28:21.298 --> 28:24.067
Relax, we got a text system
set up for our talent shows.

28:24.101 --> 28:25.002
Call the networks.

28:25.036 --> 28:27.071
Tell them to turn on premium.
- Copy that.

28:27.104 --> 28:30.208
All proceeds will be matched
by the WBC network

28:30.240 --> 28:32.809
up to $100,000.

28:34.211 --> 28:35.980
Fuck off!
That's not true!

28:36.012 --> 28:37.081
It is now.

28:38.949 --> 28:40.284
Ladies and gentlemen,

28:40.317 --> 28:43.354
let's show Sara Hickey
that her sacrifice tonight

28:43.386 --> 28:46.022
won't be in vain.

28:52.896 --> 28:54.499
Cue on one.
- Yes, sir.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.201
House lights fade.

29:34.471 --> 29:35.839
Yeah.

29:35.873 --> 29:37.575
What if she chickens out?

29:37.607 --> 29:39.810
<i>We play as a redemption story,</i>

29:39.844 --> 29:43.014
okay? Oh, and by the way,
great work on that video.

29:43.047 --> 29:44.414
All right, now please
let me watch this.

29:54.525 --> 29:56.326
It is lights out, my prince.

30:31.996 --> 30:33.998
What the fuck?

31:23.547 --> 31:24.515
Oh, come on.

31:24.548 --> 31:25.883
Keller, play the emotions.

31:25.915 --> 31:28.051
Zack, how much money did we raise so far?
- Start on three.

31:28.085 --> 31:29.519
$29...
no, $30,000.

31:36.593 --> 31:37.561
Show me the audience.

31:37.594 --> 31:38.662
Give me a close-up on 2.
- $45,000.

31:38.694 --> 31:41.097
Should I play redemptive music?
- No. Adam,

31:41.131 --> 31:42.500
<i>don't come out yet.</i>

31:42.532 --> 31:44.334
Okay, okay.
Okay, I'll wait.

31:44.367 --> 31:47.337
Emily.

31:47.371 --> 31:49.373
I'm doing this for you.

31:49.405 --> 31:50.642
I'm sorry.

31:52.343 --> 31:54.979
I don't want to rot in jail
for the rest of your life.

31:58.115 --> 32:01.986
They'll find your dad's body
in our garage.

32:07.624 --> 32:10.327
Oh!

32:11.362 --> 32:13.564
She did it.
Good girl.

32:13.596 --> 32:15.432
Pull out! Jesus
Christ, pull out!

32:15.465 --> 32:16.967
Flicker the lights.

32:51.367 --> 32:54.504
<i>Thank you for watching
This Is Your Death.</i>

32:56.339 --> 32:58.708
Life is precious.

32:58.741 --> 33:01.077
Make the most of it.

33:01.111 --> 33:02.380
See you next week.

33:26.670 --> 33:29.673
And... cut to commercial.

33:43.519 --> 33:44.754
Everyone's phones still off?

33:44.788 --> 33:47.223
Yeah.

33:47.257 --> 33:48.558
Congratulations.

33:48.592 --> 33:51.295
You just cost the
network $100,000.

33:51.327 --> 33:52.328
We raised $100,000?

33:52.362 --> 33:54.298
$200,000 actually.

33:54.330 --> 33:56.132
But we only had to
match up to $100,000.

33:56.165 --> 33:59.803
Wait, wait, wait. So we just
gave that girl $300,000?

33:59.836 --> 34:02.440
Yes.
- Wow!

34:02.472 --> 34:03.574
That's good!

34:03.606 --> 34:06.309
Is this show now about money?

34:06.343 --> 34:09.547
No, this is a show about giving
girls like that a future.

34:09.579 --> 34:11.181
By killing her mother.

34:11.215 --> 34:12.681
Sara died of her own volition

34:12.715 --> 34:15.219
after consulting a trained
psychiatrist and physician,

34:15.251 --> 34:17.822
and, because of it, she bettered
the life of her daughter.

34:17.855 --> 34:19.422
That's right.

34:19.456 --> 34:20.422
By killing herself.

34:20.456 --> 34:22.559
No, by showing people
that not everybody on TV

34:22.592 --> 34:25.395
is rich and pretty
and living the American dream.

34:25.429 --> 34:27.164
By killing herself.

34:27.197 --> 34:29.467
Yes, Sylvia, by killing herself.

34:29.500 --> 34:32.369
Look, not everything in this
world deserves a happy ending.

34:32.402 --> 34:35.139
Sophocles knew this.
Euripides knew this.

34:35.172 --> 34:37.108
Shakespeare knew this.
Milton, Beckett...

34:37.141 --> 34:38.842
What-- what're you doing?

34:38.876 --> 34:40.011
Looking to see

34:40.043 --> 34:42.480
if you secretly have Wikipedia
open on your phone.

34:46.916 --> 34:48.184
Uh, shots anyone?

34:48.217 --> 34:49.219
Yes.
- Yeah.

34:56.460 --> 34:58.528
Hey, good news.
I found you more hours.

34:58.561 --> 35:00.563
Really?
Thank you.

35:00.597 --> 35:02.600
Hey, I appreciate it.
- Yeah, no problem.

35:02.632 --> 35:05.869
It's three hours a night in Riverside.
It starts at 2:30am.

35:05.902 --> 35:07.770
Woah, Jerry, wait.
2:30?

35:07.804 --> 35:09.673
I-I finish here at 2:00.

35:09.706 --> 35:12.376
I can't make it from Century
City to Riverside in 30 minutes.

35:12.409 --> 35:13.744
It takes 75 minutes, no traffic.

35:13.777 --> 35:15.713
Sorry, man.
Take it or leave it.

35:15.746 --> 35:16.881
No, no--
Woah, woah, woah.

35:16.914 --> 35:19.450
Jerry, if I take it and I'm
late, you're gonna fire me.

35:19.483 --> 35:20.985
Hey, look.
I'll tell you what.

35:21.018 --> 35:23.220
Why don't I get there at 3:00 and I go
till 6:00? I'll speed as fast as I can.

35:23.253 --> 35:24.922
No. No can do.
It's a finance office.

35:24.954 --> 35:26.489
They come into work at 5:30.

35:26.523 --> 35:30.361
Well, I'm sorry, then.
I can't take it.

35:33.429 --> 35:35.698
Well, I, too, am sorry.

35:35.731 --> 35:39.536
QMB Janitorial Corporation will
no longer need your services.

35:39.570 --> 35:41.739
We'll send you your final
two paychecks by mail.

35:41.771 --> 35:43.740
Wait-- no, no--
Come on, Jerry!

35:43.773 --> 35:44.875
Look, come on, I'm never late,

35:44.907 --> 35:46.442
I work harder than
everyone else!

35:46.476 --> 35:47.612
Why are you settin' me up?

35:48.978 --> 35:50.547
Is this about the benefits?

35:50.581 --> 35:52.316
Look-- look, forget
I even asked.

35:52.349 --> 35:54.852
Look, I don't care about the benefits.
Forget it.

35:54.885 --> 35:57.788
Jerry? Jerry! Jerry!

36:09.967 --> 36:11.335
What you're doing is barbaric.

36:13.469 --> 36:15.772
I thought you stood
for something.

36:15.806 --> 36:18.576
Thank you.
I appreciate your...

36:18.608 --> 36:21.511
input. Asshole.

36:23.981 --> 36:26.317
Oh, no. Did you turn on
your phone?

36:26.349 --> 36:29.987
Uh, no. No, I'm, uh... I'm good.

36:30.019 --> 36:31.722
Uh, why don't we get outta here?

36:31.755 --> 36:33.423
Ah, yeah.

36:33.456 --> 36:36.359
I'm not like that, okay?
I'll drop you off.

36:36.393 --> 36:38.896
That's okay, I can get
my own Uber. Thank you.

36:38.929 --> 36:40.831
We can Uber together.
Let's Uber pool.

36:40.864 --> 36:43.601
It's cheap, and we may not
have jobs tomorrow, so...

36:43.634 --> 36:45.336
You know nothing about me.

36:45.369 --> 36:46.604
That's not true!

36:46.637 --> 36:47.838
I know you're from Cleveland.

36:47.871 --> 36:48.639
Oh.

36:48.672 --> 36:50.907
And I know you're an only child.

36:50.940 --> 36:53.576
And I know that you would
rather be living in New York,

36:53.610 --> 36:56.947
but Broadway is your
ex-husband's domain,

36:56.980 --> 36:59.250
so here you are,
slumming it on TV.

36:59.282 --> 37:01.951
Well, my, uh, my panties
are sopping wet.

37:01.985 --> 37:03.153
I'm not finished.

37:03.186 --> 37:05.556
I know that you eat too much
kale for your own good,

37:05.588 --> 37:08.791
and I know that you think that
real men don't drink white wine,

37:08.824 --> 37:11.294
but I don't really give
a shit because I love it.

37:15.666 --> 37:19.704
And I also know that, like me...

37:21.405 --> 37:25.776
you just want to make
something meaningful and lasting

37:25.809 --> 37:28.479
in this screwed up,

37:28.512 --> 37:32.816
swipe right, shit-for-brains
world we live in.

37:32.849 --> 37:33.884
How am I doing?

37:37.086 --> 37:40.423
You might just be the smartest
idiot that I've ever met.

37:40.456 --> 37:41.391
Really?
- Mm-hmm.

37:41.425 --> 37:42.826
Yeah, well, I did go
to Yale for two years.

37:42.858 --> 37:43.826
Did you?
- Yeah.

37:43.860 --> 37:45.829
Why did you drop out?

37:47.097 --> 37:49.700
Wouldn't you like to know?
- Mm-hmm.

37:51.400 --> 37:52.536
Let's go.

37:52.568 --> 37:53.871
This is not a yes.

37:53.903 --> 37:56.507
I never said it was a yes.

37:56.539 --> 37:57.842
O... kay.

38:10.686 --> 38:12.088
Excuse me, sir.

38:12.121 --> 38:15.826
Uh, the dishwasher
you've got, the old guy?

38:15.858 --> 38:16.994
He's a real dick.

38:18.561 --> 38:20.630
Him.

38:20.664 --> 38:23.334
<i>A new show aired
on the WBC network last night.</i>

38:23.367 --> 38:27.403
The incredible thing is the show
seemingly came out of nowhere.

38:27.436 --> 38:30.007
No press, no advertising, nada.

38:30.039 --> 38:32.675
<i>Now, if it turns out to be real,</i>

38:32.708 --> 38:35.978
<i>WBC is gonna have a lot
to answer for.</i>

38:36.012 --> 38:37.881
Just take a look
at our Facebook page.

38:37.914 --> 38:40.384
People are enraged.

38:40.416 --> 38:43.653
<i>I'm taking callers.
First up, Ne--</i>

38:46.856 --> 38:49.625
Holy shit.

38:51.628 --> 38:53.530
Okay, okay!

38:53.563 --> 38:56.400
Hey, hey, hey!

38:56.432 --> 38:57.434
Karina, what the f-

38:57.467 --> 38:59.435
Now I know why you've
been hiding from me.

38:59.469 --> 39:00.804
Uh, can we talk about
this later, please?

39:00.836 --> 39:02.739
You told me that you
were getting out.

39:02.773 --> 39:04.675
I did get out. This is
not a reality show.

39:04.708 --> 39:05.843
No shit, it's worse.

39:05.876 --> 39:07.644
Can we-- can we-- seriously.
- No, no, no, no.

39:07.677 --> 39:09.445
Everybody at work knows
that I'm your sister.

39:09.478 --> 39:12.715
I don't-- you-- you can't
fucking do this to me!

39:12.748 --> 39:14.884
What? I'm not-- this is not about you.
- Are you kidding me?

39:14.918 --> 39:16.086
Adam, have you got my phone?

39:16.119 --> 39:18.789
Oh, I'm... sorry.

39:18.822 --> 39:22.826
Hey. Uh, uh, Sylvia, this is
my sister, Karina.

39:22.858 --> 39:24.460
Karina, Sylvia.

39:24.494 --> 39:25.496
Hi.

39:26.530 --> 39:28.732
Hi. Girlfriend?

39:28.764 --> 39:29.732
Yeah.
- No.

39:29.766 --> 39:32.970
No, no.
I am his producer

39:33.003 --> 39:37.408
and this was a drunken decision.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.643
Come on.
Transparency, right?

39:39.675 --> 39:41.177
Sylvia, I don't like your show.

39:41.210 --> 39:42.645
Oh, neither do I.

39:42.679 --> 39:43.914
Trust me.

39:45.548 --> 39:47.751
Okay.

39:47.784 --> 39:50.153
I like her, Adam.
Don't fuck it up.

39:50.186 --> 39:51.788
Thanks for your input.

39:54.623 --> 39:55.625
Shut up.

39:55.659 --> 39:57.494
<i>Our country has never been</i>

39:57.527 --> 39:59.195
<i>more politically
or socially fractured.</i>

39:59.228 --> 40:02.465
<i>People watch and read
the news they agree with.</i>

40:02.498 --> 40:05.501
<i>There's no dissenting
opinion anymore.</i>

40:05.534 --> 40:08.538
<i>There's no honest debate.
It's just theatrics.</i>

40:08.572 --> 40:09.974
<i>This whole show is theatrics.</i>

40:10.007 --> 40:12.842
<i>Wait a second. Are you
talking about our show or theirs?</i>

40:12.876 --> 40:15.446
Hi, daddy.
How was work?

40:15.478 --> 40:17.747
It was fantastic.
How was your sleep?

40:17.780 --> 40:20.049
They cut our cable
and internet last night.

40:20.083 --> 40:21.218
I see.

40:21.251 --> 40:24.488
Well, more time to read, hit
the books and study, right?

40:24.521 --> 40:25.489
Dad, is everything o--

40:25.521 --> 40:27.824
Hey, you got any tests today?

40:30.827 --> 40:32.563
History.
- Are you ready?

40:32.596 --> 40:33.630
Of course, but can we--

40:33.664 --> 40:35.899
Who was the 16th president
of the United States?

40:35.931 --> 40:37.000
Abe Lincoln, but--

40:37.032 --> 40:38.534
And who was the 17th?

40:38.568 --> 40:41.071
I don't know. My test
is on the Civil War.

40:41.103 --> 40:42.304
So what?

40:42.338 --> 40:45.107
The future president's gotta know
all his predecessors, right?

40:45.141 --> 40:48.711
I guess so.

40:51.081 --> 40:54.617
<i>...salacious,
and downright unconscionable.</i>

40:54.650 --> 40:56.219
<i>Not only should it be taken
off the air,</i>

40:56.253 --> 40:57.888
<i>the creator should be jailed!</i>

40:57.920 --> 40:59.088
<i>Oh, come on now.</i>

40:59.121 --> 41:01.692
<i>It's provocative, yes,</i>

41:01.724 --> 41:05.027
<i>but what if we take Adam Rogers
seriously for a moment?</i>

41:05.061 --> 41:06.028
<i>What if he's right?</i>

41:06.061 --> 41:09.599
<i>What if this show is exactly
what we need--</i>

41:09.632 --> 41:11.134
All right, little man.

41:11.166 --> 41:12.668
I'm gonna prep you for surgery.

41:12.702 --> 41:15.038
Last check-up before I go.

41:15.070 --> 41:17.507
How are you feeling?
You still nauseous?

41:17.541 --> 41:19.776
I'm fine, but the news
has been crapping

41:19.809 --> 41:22.546
all over your brother
this morning.

41:22.579 --> 41:24.715
I don't want you watching that garbage.
You're too young.

41:24.748 --> 41:27.684
Please.
I'm as mature as you.

41:27.717 --> 41:28.719
Funny man, huh?

41:32.322 --> 41:35.259
You're not gonna worry, right?
Routine procedure.

41:35.291 --> 41:37.860
That's what they always say.

41:37.893 --> 41:40.696
You're gonna be just fine.
- That too.

41:40.730 --> 41:44.934
But my favorite one
is "you're so strong".

41:49.606 --> 41:51.975
It's the water commission.

41:52.007 --> 41:53.943
They call at 9:00,
right after the cable company,

41:53.976 --> 41:56.980
who won't be calling no more
'cause it's shut down.

41:57.012 --> 41:59.083
I lost my job.

42:00.951 --> 42:01.985
Which one?

42:03.586 --> 42:04.588
Both of them.

42:07.356 --> 42:09.293
Dare I ask why?

42:09.326 --> 42:10.661
Does it matter?

42:13.896 --> 42:17.134
Okay. Okay, I can
pick up the slack.

42:18.601 --> 42:20.170
I'll try to get some
more hours at the hotel

42:20.202 --> 42:21.838
and I'll join Mary Kay.

42:21.871 --> 42:23.240
I can sew--
- Rebecca.

42:23.273 --> 42:25.842
I can sell Tupperware,
I can sell vitamins--

42:25.875 --> 42:28.110
Rebecca, I'm not giving up.
- I know.

42:28.143 --> 42:30.947
But I don't think you
understand what I'm saying.

42:34.117 --> 42:37.754
You lose this house
and you lose us.

42:43.226 --> 42:46.663
Hello, this is Mason Washington.
The money's coming.

42:46.695 --> 42:48.764
I appreciate your patience.
Thank you.

42:50.132 --> 42:53.636
We quintupled our audience twice
over from beginning to end,

42:53.670 --> 42:55.938
and that's not even counting
plus three and plus five.

42:55.972 --> 42:58.075
Does this mean that we're number--
- Number three.

42:58.108 --> 43:00.911
Behind NBC and CBS, but still.

43:00.943 --> 43:03.313
With no press, no promotion?
Not bad.

43:03.346 --> 43:04.947
We're gonna be
number one next week.

43:04.981 --> 43:06.683
That's a ten million
viewer jump.

43:06.715 --> 43:08.652
Yeah, I understand
ratings share.

43:09.753 --> 43:11.788
Holy shit.
- All right, hot shot.

43:11.820 --> 43:12.956
Here's my concern.

43:14.157 --> 43:17.627
People are going to tire of
giving contestants pity money.

43:17.661 --> 43:19.028
Okay, first of all,
they're not contestants,

43:19.061 --> 43:20.896
and it's not pity money.
- Oh, you know what I mean.

43:20.929 --> 43:23.666
We are giving our audience
the power to enact change,

43:23.699 --> 43:26.068
to empathize with the
people they relate to.

43:26.101 --> 43:27.403
It's not gonna get
too old, too fast.

43:27.436 --> 43:29.172
Oh, yeah, it will.
Trust me.

43:29.204 --> 43:32.241
You created an event.
We need a show.

43:32.275 --> 43:34.177
We'll just bring
more people on each week.

43:34.210 --> 43:35.746
We'll pick up the pace.
- Done.

43:35.778 --> 43:38.047
But that doesn't address
my main concern.

43:38.081 --> 43:39.048
Which is what?

43:39.081 --> 43:41.719
You need this audience
as much as I do, Adam.

43:44.387 --> 43:45.956
I'll keep them invested.

44:01.905 --> 44:07.044
Last week an American
ended her life

44:07.077 --> 44:09.913
right in front of you
on national television.

44:09.945 --> 44:12.081
It was shocking.

44:12.114 --> 44:16.085
Some say it was appalling...

44:16.119 --> 44:17.387
but it was real.

44:21.123 --> 44:24.927
We changed a young girl's
life for the better.

44:24.960 --> 44:26.962
Now, if you don't like
what we're doing here,

44:26.996 --> 44:29.298
please, change the channel.

44:29.331 --> 44:32.234
Close your browser,
file a complaint,

44:32.268 --> 44:34.271
or simply turn it off.

44:34.304 --> 44:36.873
Will this fellow ever
follow the script?

44:36.905 --> 44:40.844
But I'm willing to bet
that you won't.

44:40.876 --> 44:43.012
Because, deep down, you know

44:43.045 --> 44:45.748
that what we're doing here
is important.

44:47.182 --> 44:48.951
You're angry.

44:48.985 --> 44:51.887
You want change.

44:51.920 --> 44:56.259
You believe in the value
of life.

44:56.291 --> 44:58.394
Well, guess what?
So do I.

44:58.427 --> 45:00.130
And so do our three guests
tonight.

45:00.163 --> 45:01.197
Cue applause.

45:07.936 --> 45:10.139
It seems my producers want
me to get on with the show.

45:10.172 --> 45:11.808
Cue applause.

45:24.387 --> 45:27.457
Friends...

45:27.489 --> 45:31.861
last week you also changed
a young girl's life.

45:31.894 --> 45:37.067
$300,000 was raised
for Emily Hickey.

45:37.099 --> 45:40.269
$300,000!

45:40.302 --> 45:43.873
Over 100 of you even called in
offering to be her foster parent.

45:45.909 --> 45:52.750
And because of you, and you,
and you, and you...

45:54.951 --> 45:56.920
Emily will find a safe home.

45:58.021 --> 46:01.525
She'll go to college, she'll get
a degree

46:01.557 --> 46:03.994
and fulfill her mother's dreams.

46:12.302 --> 46:15.905
You have all lead by example,

46:15.938 --> 46:19.275
and the WBC network
heard you loud and clear.

46:19.309 --> 46:23.547
So from here on in...

46:23.579 --> 46:26.949
we will be donating $250,000

46:26.983 --> 46:29.586
to the guest that you believe
deserves it the most.

46:29.619 --> 46:32.255
All you have to do is vote.

46:35.123 --> 46:36.326
We go from one death to three,

46:36.358 --> 46:37.927
and now we're doing
death of the week?

46:37.960 --> 46:39.929
Was this your idea?

46:39.963 --> 46:41.265
He's flying solo, but I like it.

46:41.297 --> 46:44.466
I just have to convince our board
of directors to play along.

46:44.500 --> 46:46.436
He's gonna get himself fired.

46:46.469 --> 46:49.873
Yeah, or make himself
indispensable.

46:49.905 --> 46:51.507
All right, put me in his ear.

46:53.976 --> 46:56.612
Adam, you crazy son of a bitch.

46:56.646 --> 46:58.849
<i>We're a go.</i>

47:06.989 --> 47:10.292
<i>Please welcome Adam Rogers!</i>

47:10.326 --> 47:11.894
Let's get started.

47:11.927 --> 47:14.431
Introducing Timothy Reyes.

47:14.463 --> 47:17.099
Timothy was diagnosed with ALS

47:17.132 --> 47:20.369
and has come to share
his last moments with us.

47:39.322 --> 47:41.490
Please welcome Ellen Black.

47:41.523 --> 47:43.460
Ellen wants to donate
her potential winnings

47:43.492 --> 47:45.895
to aid Syrian refugees.

48:07.617 --> 48:10.487
<i>This is David Williams.</i>

48:10.519 --> 48:13.657
David's wife needs
a heart transplant.

48:13.690 --> 48:17.461
With no donors in sight,
he's giving his own.

48:24.400 --> 48:25.367
Do it already!

48:25.400 --> 48:27.503
Ah!

48:39.282 --> 48:40.583
Don't you think it's horrible?

48:40.615 --> 48:42.652
I do.
- So why do you do it?

48:42.684 --> 48:44.586
Because I saw somebody die,

48:44.619 --> 48:47.156
murdered, right in front
of me, not too long ago.

48:47.190 --> 48:50.025
It was a senseless
waste of life,

48:50.059 --> 48:51.995
but the deaths
on my show are not.

48:52.027 --> 48:55.397
The number one show in
the United States of America.

48:56.798 --> 48:59.101
<i>But you're profiting
off of other people's misery.</i>

48:59.135 --> 49:02.539
Isn't everybody profiting off
of other people's misery, Mark?

49:02.572 --> 49:04.307
The churches profit,
the banks profit,

49:04.340 --> 49:06.276
the fast food companies profit.

49:06.309 --> 49:07.711
Journalists
just like you profit.

49:07.744 --> 49:10.512
Don't think that you're above
this, because you're not.

49:10.545 --> 49:13.415
Besides, I'm not doing
this for the money.

49:13.449 --> 49:14.717
What are you doing it for then?

49:14.751 --> 49:17.420
I'm doing it because television
needs a wake-up call, that's why.

49:17.452 --> 49:18.688
<i>We're in pain.
We're alone.</i>

49:21.623 --> 49:22.759
<i>We need to connect again.</i>

49:22.791 --> 49:25.996
<i>We need to bridge the social,
racial and political divide,</i>

49:26.028 --> 49:28.664
<i>and I think--
Actually, I believe</i>

49:28.697 --> 49:30.699
that we are the catalyst for
that change.

49:32.367 --> 49:34.538
Adam Rogers for president!

49:55.791 --> 49:58.560
I can almost guarantee you
number one all across the world.

49:58.594 --> 49:59.862
What do you guys say?

49:59.896 --> 50:02.532
Oh, I love to hear it. I love to hear it.
Thank you so much.

50:04.500 --> 50:05.501
Try one with a smile.

50:09.172 --> 50:11.074
<i>When will it be enough?</i>

50:11.106 --> 50:13.143
That's a good question.
I don't know.

50:13.175 --> 50:14.677
When people stop watching,
I guess.

50:14.710 --> 50:17.679
When they don't need us anymore.

50:17.713 --> 50:19.816
But right now they do.

50:38.835 --> 50:42.105
Oh!

50:42.137 --> 50:46.175
<i>This Is Your Death!
This Is Your Death!</i>

50:46.208 --> 50:48.744
<i>This Is Your Death!</i>

50:48.777 --> 50:51.747
<i>This Is Your Death!</i>

50:51.780 --> 50:54.349
<i>This Is Your Death!</i>

50:58.887 --> 51:00.222
Sylvia.

51:02.425 --> 51:03.793
I owe you a drink.

51:05.894 --> 51:08.164
Look, we're a team
and I feel like...

51:09.632 --> 51:12.268
I-I guess I feel like I could
be keeping you in the loop

51:12.300 --> 51:14.436
more than I have been.

51:14.469 --> 51:16.138
And a drink is gonna solve that?

51:16.172 --> 51:17.773
No, but four might.

51:19.375 --> 51:20.510
All right.
Good night.

51:20.543 --> 51:22.811
Hey.
You can hate me,

51:22.844 --> 51:24.179
you can hate
what we're doing here,

51:24.213 --> 51:25.849
but you can't deny
that we're a good team.

51:25.882 --> 51:27.617
We're not a team.
- Yes, we are!

51:27.650 --> 51:29.485
No! No, come on.

51:29.518 --> 51:32.187
You just do whatever you want
and I clean up your messes.

51:32.221 --> 51:33.322
Right.

51:33.356 --> 51:36.392
One of these days
I will stop, though.

51:36.425 --> 51:38.528
We have the number one show
on television.

51:38.561 --> 51:40.797
I made you rich.

51:40.829 --> 51:42.699
I mean, what else do you want?

51:44.400 --> 51:45.501
<i>What else do you want?</i>

51:45.534 --> 51:47.536
I want a drink.

51:47.570 --> 51:49.239
Maybe a sleepover.

51:50.907 --> 51:52.209
Good night, Adam.

51:57.313 --> 51:59.148
I'll take you up on that drink.

52:04.387 --> 52:06.789
You Washington?
- Yeah.

52:06.822 --> 52:08.590
You the foreman?
- Yep.

52:08.623 --> 52:12.261
It's nice to see you.
I've got you my résumé.

52:14.429 --> 52:16.365
Oh, uh, you think about dyin'?

52:16.398 --> 52:18.400
Excuse me?

52:18.434 --> 52:19.869
Oh yeah, that.

52:19.902 --> 52:21.737
Yeah, that's the truth.

52:21.771 --> 52:22.906
You gotta see it.

52:24.606 --> 52:27.943
Anyhow, this is a union job.

52:27.976 --> 52:30.712
How do you have so much
experience with no union card?

52:30.746 --> 52:34.951
Oh, well, I was, uh... a
temp filler over in Chicago,

52:34.983 --> 52:37.519
and it kinda, you know, basically
turned into a full-time job.

52:37.552 --> 52:38.654
Fuckin' Chicago.

52:38.688 --> 52:41.291
Yeah, well, you got that right.

52:41.324 --> 52:46.896
Well, we're looking to fill
the 8:00 to 6:00 spot.

52:46.929 --> 52:48.831
That's pm to am.

52:48.864 --> 52:50.666
You'll need to join the
longshoremen's union, too,

52:50.699 --> 52:52.768
so there'll be some upfront
costs there, as well.

52:52.802 --> 52:54.871
Hey, no problem.
I get benefits, right?

52:54.903 --> 52:57.940
Oh, yeah, yeah.

52:57.974 --> 52:59.843
It happens
all the time. Look.

53:01.577 --> 53:03.780
Now I'm gonna need to see

53:03.813 --> 53:06.383
your forklift certification
for ocean.

53:10.418 --> 53:11.554
Is there a problem?

53:12.554 --> 53:14.456
Listen, I need this job bad.

53:14.489 --> 53:15.991
Now, I can do anything
your guys can do,

53:16.025 --> 53:18.728
I just don't have any forklift
experience, but I'm a quick study.

53:18.760 --> 53:21.431
Trust me.
- Can you lash a ship?

53:21.463 --> 53:23.299
Of course.
- What's lashing, then?

53:24.500 --> 53:27.971
I'm sorry, Mr. Washington.

53:28.003 --> 53:29.438
We don't have the time
or resources

53:29.472 --> 53:31.007
to be training greenhorns
right now,

53:31.039 --> 53:32.442
especially someone
as old as you.

53:32.474 --> 53:33.576
Please, sir.
Look, I got a family,

53:33.610 --> 53:35.878
I got two kids, I got a
house I'm about to lose.

53:35.911 --> 53:37.646
I'll do anything you ask.

53:37.679 --> 53:40.916
Brunt labor, overtime,
janitorial.

53:40.949 --> 53:43.685
You wanna go clean toilets?
Go talk to the port.

53:43.719 --> 53:45.588
Wait, no, no, wait, wait,
wait! Hold on, man.

53:45.621 --> 53:47.356
Don't-- don't turn
your back on me.

53:47.389 --> 53:48.590
Look, I'm out of options!

53:48.623 --> 53:50.025
Get out of my way, son!

53:51.427 --> 53:52.961
You usually call
your elders "son"?

53:55.597 --> 53:57.266
Go fuck yourself!

53:59.869 --> 54:01.238
Aaargh!

54:02.672 --> 54:04.840
Time to call the janitor, boss!

54:17.385 --> 54:19.422
Jesus.
- Move forward. Right there.

54:19.454 --> 54:20.690
Ah...

54:26.429 --> 54:29.532
Holy shit.
- Yeah. Yeah, right?

54:29.565 --> 54:30.900
Look at this.
My favorite part.

54:30.932 --> 54:32.302
Come here, come here, come here.

54:34.536 --> 54:36.438
See that casita back there?

54:36.472 --> 54:39.709
Two bedrooms, full kitchen,
and it's got your name on it.

54:39.742 --> 54:42.345
I can't afford that.

54:42.378 --> 54:44.447
You really think I'm
gonna make you pay rent?

54:44.480 --> 54:47.317
You can stay there for free
as long as you want.

54:47.349 --> 54:50.353
Okay? All you gotta do is, you
know, save up for your own place.

54:50.385 --> 54:52.788
Adam, I got six-figure
credit card debt to pay off

54:52.822 --> 54:54.356
before I can even think
about buying a house.

54:54.389 --> 54:55.391
Right, right, right.

54:55.423 --> 54:58.894
Right?
- That reminds me.

54:59.994 --> 55:01.431
Come on.

55:06.501 --> 55:09.971
I'm not making you rich, I'm
just putting you back to zero.

55:10.005 --> 55:12.474
No. Adam, I can't.

55:12.507 --> 55:14.009
I-I haven't seen you
in three months,

55:14.043 --> 55:15.778
you know you're my only friend.

55:15.811 --> 55:17.880
I-I know, I know.
And I'm sorry.

55:17.913 --> 55:20.083
I've just been...
I've been really busy.

55:21.751 --> 55:24.019
Would you look at yourself?

55:24.052 --> 55:25.621
Would you look at this house?

55:25.653 --> 55:28.623
This is sick.
- Yeah.

55:28.657 --> 55:30.727
Yeah, you mean sick like cool?

55:30.760 --> 55:31.994
Because...
- No.

55:32.027 --> 55:34.364
Because I agree.
- No, Adam, I'm not joking,

55:34.396 --> 55:35.864
and I do not want
your blood money.

55:37.065 --> 55:41.002
You're my sister and I love you,
and you've been doing so well

55:41.036 --> 55:42.838
and I promised that I was
gonna take care of you.

55:42.871 --> 55:45.674
At what cost, Adam?
- What do you mean, at what cost?

55:45.708 --> 55:49.144
How many people had to
die for this house?

55:49.177 --> 55:51.646
For that check?

55:51.679 --> 55:54.916
Ten? 30? 50?

55:54.949 --> 55:56.718
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Don't be ridiculous.

55:56.751 --> 55:57.987
Is death ridiculous to you now?

55:58.019 --> 55:59.121
No, it isn't--
- Do you know what I do?

55:59.155 --> 56:02.024
No, it's not ridiculous,
and if you watched my show,

56:02.056 --> 56:04.593
you'd know that I take
my job very seriously.

56:04.626 --> 56:06.695
By showing death,
I am single-handedly

56:06.728 --> 56:08.130
changing people's
approach to life.

56:08.164 --> 56:09.565
The world's finally waking up.

56:09.597 --> 56:11.634
You are a fucking game
show host, Adam!

56:11.666 --> 56:14.503
And that is all!

56:14.536 --> 56:16.505
Wake up!

56:29.885 --> 56:32.822
<i>And now, your host, Adam Rogers!</i>

56:36.625 --> 56:37.827
Thank you.

56:43.798 --> 56:49.538
So I had an interesting and sobering
conversation with my sister today,

56:49.572 --> 56:51.641
and in the name of transparency,

56:51.673 --> 56:53.175
I thought I would
share it with you.

56:53.208 --> 56:54.309
Oh, no.

56:54.344 --> 56:59.715
She thinks that what we're
doing here is abominable.

57:02.217 --> 57:04.519
No, no, no. It's okay.
It's okay.

57:04.552 --> 57:07.589
Camera one.
- Dissenting opinion is okay.

57:07.623 --> 57:08.858
Camera three.

57:08.891 --> 57:11.693
But what really got me was when
she called it a game show,

57:11.726 --> 57:12.994
as if--

57:13.028 --> 57:16.766
Yeah, yeah, as if all that was
at stake here is the money.

57:16.798 --> 57:19.001
Cut to one.

57:19.034 --> 57:21.103
Yeah, I know.
It hurt me, too.

57:21.135 --> 57:23.873
<i>It was ignorant.</i>

57:23.905 --> 57:25.574
<i>And insensitive.</i>

57:27.775 --> 57:28.976
<i>Not to me, but to the folks</i>

57:29.010 --> 57:33.148
<i>who have literally given
their lives for a higher cause.</i>

57:33.181 --> 57:35.517
<i>And the fact that it came
from my own sister,</i>

57:35.550 --> 57:39.221
<i>the only family member
that I have left in this world.</i>

57:41.023 --> 57:42.892
<i>I guess that just made it hurt
even worse.</i>

57:47.295 --> 57:48.931
We'll be back
after these messages

57:48.963 --> 57:50.866
<i>with more This Is Your Death.</i>

57:58.673 --> 58:00.509
<i>- What?
- Hi, Karina?</i>

58:00.543 --> 58:02.612
It's Sylvia. He really doesn't
mean what he's saying.

58:02.644 --> 58:03.612
How did you get my number?

58:03.646 --> 58:04.914
<i>You're Adam's emergency contact.</i>

58:04.947 --> 58:07.148
<i>- Fuck him.
- I'm sorry I'm calling you, but I--</i>

58:07.181 --> 58:09.050
Fuck you.
- I agree.

58:09.083 --> 58:11.152
Fuck both of us. Just please,
please don't blame yourself.

58:11.186 --> 58:15.557
<i>Uh, Adam told me a little bit
about your history and...</i>

58:15.590 --> 58:19.728
<i>I really don't mean to pry but I think
it might be a good idea to call someone.</i>

58:19.762 --> 58:21.230
I don't need a fucking
therapist right now.

58:21.262 --> 58:23.098
I need to relax.

58:23.132 --> 58:27.202
What happened to my brother?!!

58:27.235 --> 58:29.771
I don't know.

58:29.804 --> 58:32.541
I really don't know.

58:32.574 --> 58:33.708
I'm so sorry.

58:43.619 --> 58:44.987
On in 25.

58:45.019 --> 58:47.989
Listen, I-- I have
to keep running this show,

58:48.023 --> 58:49.925
but I'm not getting
off the phone

58:49.958 --> 58:51.960
until you tell me
you're gonna be okay.

59:01.269 --> 59:03.739
Okay, I'll call.

59:04.773 --> 59:06.209
I owe you one.

59:08.911 --> 59:10.046
Stay on.

59:12.947 --> 59:14.817
In time.

59:14.849 --> 59:18.820
On in five, four, three...

59:22.724 --> 59:24.326
Standby VTR.

59:24.360 --> 59:26.762
Ladies and gentlemen,
what are we here to do?

59:26.795 --> 59:29.298
To change.

59:29.331 --> 59:31.834
And what are we gonna change?
- The world!

59:31.867 --> 59:34.202
<i>- I'm sorry, what are we gonna change?
- Adam's on here next.</i>

59:34.235 --> 59:36.004
<i>- The world!
- What're you guys watching?</i>

59:36.038 --> 59:39.641
Derrick made an antenna.
We got basic cable back.

59:39.675 --> 59:42.178
<i>- What're we here to do?
- Don't watch this trash.</i>

59:42.210 --> 59:44.947
It ain't trash, pops.
It's people like us.

59:47.715 --> 59:49.317
Dad!
- Mason!

59:49.351 --> 59:52.121
Those people are not like us.

59:52.153 --> 59:53.556
They're poor and desperate.

59:53.588 --> 59:56.891
They're sacrificing themselves for
the betterment of their families.

59:56.925 --> 59:59.061
Do these four walls look
poor and desperate to you?

59:59.094 --> 01:00:00.262
Mason.
- No!

01:00:00.295 --> 01:00:02.999
Do you know how hard I worked
to get you into a good school

01:00:03.032 --> 01:00:04.834
so you could do things I
could never dream of doing?

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:06.869
Yeah, dad, I do.

01:00:06.902 --> 01:00:10.039
And I also know that we're
about to lose it all.

01:00:10.072 --> 01:00:12.008
What? You think
I'm dumb?

01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:15.978
You think I don't hear you
and mom arguing every night?

01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:18.648
I tried talking to you
like a million times,

01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:22.050
and every time you shut
me down like I'm a kid.

01:00:22.083 --> 01:00:24.886
But I'm not.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:28.257
My crutches are six
inches too small,

01:00:28.289 --> 01:00:30.659
but I don't say nothing,

01:00:30.693 --> 01:00:33.663
'cause I know that you
can't afford to fix it.

01:00:33.695 --> 01:00:35.797
So you want to deal
with this by yourself?

01:00:35.831 --> 01:00:38.668
Then fucking deal with it, okay?

01:00:53.382 --> 01:00:55.818
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome our next guest.

01:00:55.851 --> 01:00:58.688
This is Meg Waters,
here to remind us

01:00:58.721 --> 01:01:03.358
that not all soldiers are ordered
to fight the good fight.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:21.143
Not all soldiers are ordered
to fight the good fight, huh?

01:01:21.175 --> 01:01:22.277
That includes us.

01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:23.979
Yeah, no, I understand metaphor.

01:01:24.012 --> 01:01:25.247
You fucking prick.
- I'm sorry,

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.283
was that a metaphor or a simile?

01:01:27.315 --> 01:01:31.019
It's a statement.
Hey, call your sister.

01:01:31.052 --> 01:01:33.088
She saw what you said and
she's having a breakdown.

01:01:33.121 --> 01:01:34.824
Well, that's not the first time.

01:01:34.856 --> 01:01:36.092
I'll call her after the show.

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:39.461
Adam--
- After the show, Sylvia.

01:01:39.494 --> 01:01:42.130
She's why you quit Yale,
isn't she?

01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:50.972
We're losing the audience.
They can't see.

01:01:51.005 --> 01:01:52.774
This is a bad idea.

01:01:52.807 --> 01:01:54.409
Cue the heartbeats.

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:07.823
I-I-- Is she passed out?

01:02:07.856 --> 01:02:09.759
Can I get the interior car view?

01:02:09.791 --> 01:02:10.925
Cue camera one.

01:02:10.958 --> 01:02:13.495
Stand by, car cam 2.

01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:17.333
Guys, I can't see shit.

01:02:17.365 --> 01:02:19.534
<i>- Is she dead?
- Her heart monitor says no,</i>

01:02:19.568 --> 01:02:21.203
but it shouldn't be more
than two minutes.

01:02:21.235 --> 01:02:22.871
Put up the facts about the CO2.

01:02:22.905 --> 01:02:24.507
<i>- Insert CO2 details.
- She's not dying!</i>

01:02:27.108 --> 01:02:28.277
She's not dying!

01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:30.112
We're losing our audience.

01:02:30.144 --> 01:02:32.815
Come on, get
your shit together out there.

01:02:32.847 --> 01:02:34.983
This is fucking boring.
Kill it.

01:02:35.016 --> 01:02:37.285
We can't fake a death!
Adam, back me up here.

01:02:37.318 --> 01:02:39.154
<i>We are all about
transparency, am I right?</i>

01:02:39.188 --> 01:02:41.490
<i>We're not faking a death.</i>

01:02:41.523 --> 01:02:43.760
She can die backstage
for all I care.

01:02:50.298 --> 01:02:51.601
Let her finish backstage.

01:02:51.634 --> 01:02:54.269
<i>- Adam, I really don't think that's--
- Just do it.</i>

01:02:59.173 --> 01:03:01.143
Okay, slow down the heartbeat.

01:03:01.175 --> 01:03:03.045
Slower.

01:03:03.077 --> 01:03:05.181
Slower.

01:03:05.213 --> 01:03:07.449
And kill it.

01:03:18.059 --> 01:03:21.864
Ladies and gentlemen, Meg Waters.

01:03:21.896 --> 01:03:23.498
Come on, people, Meg Waters.

01:03:26.001 --> 01:03:27.269
There we go.

01:03:31.572 --> 01:03:35.243
<i>We'll be back with more This
Is Your Death right after this.</i>

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.248
Whoa, did you see that?

01:03:41.884 --> 01:03:43.552
She's not dead!
Did anyone see that?

01:03:44.952 --> 01:03:45.987
Damn.

01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:49.192
Fuck.

01:03:52.628 --> 01:03:53.996
Excuse me.

01:04:03.572 --> 01:04:05.575
Hello!
Thank you. Yeah.

01:04:11.346 --> 01:04:12.882
She isn't out yet.
Can I get her out?

01:04:12.914 --> 01:04:14.983
No, no, no. Don't touch
it, don't touch it.

01:04:15.016 --> 01:04:17.485
If we pull her out and
she dies, it's on us.

01:04:21.222 --> 01:04:23.226
Give me that. Okay.
- Yeah.

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:33.469
Shit.

01:04:35.536 --> 01:04:38.172
Okay. Okay, everything's
gonna be okay.

01:04:38.206 --> 01:04:40.009
Jesus Christ!

01:04:43.411 --> 01:04:44.980
No, no, no. No!
- Let me out, please!

01:04:58.492 --> 01:05:00.630
The world is a better place
because of our show.

01:05:02.297 --> 01:05:05.134
To heal, we need to see pain,

01:05:05.166 --> 01:05:06.969
and our cause is too important

01:05:07.001 --> 01:05:10.172
to be hijacked by a woman
who had second thoughts!

01:05:10.204 --> 01:05:12.208
She chose this!

01:05:14.342 --> 01:05:17.045
She chose this. Hey.

01:05:22.516 --> 01:05:25.587
Jesus Christ.
Die already.

01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:30.726
Okay. Just let me
handle this.

01:05:30.759 --> 01:05:32.661
Just let me handle this.

01:05:32.693 --> 01:05:35.331
Good work.
Good work.

01:05:50.679 --> 01:05:52.181
It's okay!

01:06:32.253 --> 01:06:33.521
Take care of it.

01:06:37.059 --> 01:06:40.162
All right, people,
we're back in 15 seconds.

01:07:01.449 --> 01:07:03.351
They think we faked her death.

01:07:04.652 --> 01:07:07.255
What happened in the car, Adam?

01:07:08.489 --> 01:07:12.160
Ilana told me our
numbers are down.

01:07:12.193 --> 01:07:14.563
I think people
are getting bored.

01:07:14.596 --> 01:07:15.764
We need to up the stakes.

01:07:15.797 --> 01:07:17.800
What happened in the car, Adam?

01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:21.570
Nothing.

01:07:21.603 --> 01:07:24.240
Turns out she died
on stage, after all.

01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:33.347
No more staging
anti-climactic deaths.

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:35.716
We need "boom."

01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:37.652
What about their
reasons for dying?

01:07:37.686 --> 01:07:41.423
Isn't that the most
important thing?

01:07:41.456 --> 01:07:43.059
Hmm?

01:07:45.226 --> 01:07:47.528
Nothing.

01:07:47.561 --> 01:07:49.730
Ilana.
- All right. Get going.

01:07:49.764 --> 01:07:52.634
Excuse me.
I have an idea.

01:07:52.666 --> 01:07:55.403
We need to make a splash if we're gonna
get renewed for a second season,

01:07:55.436 --> 01:07:56.838
am I right?
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:56.871 --> 01:07:58.873
Right. $250,000
is not gonna cut it

01:07:58.907 --> 01:08:00.609
if we want to attract
the best contestants.

01:08:00.641 --> 01:08:03.277
I thought they
weren't contestants.

01:08:03.311 --> 01:08:05.514
Are you finished?

01:08:05.547 --> 01:08:08.449
I'm thinking $1 million.
- A million?

01:08:08.483 --> 01:08:12.488
$1 million for the death of the
year on the season finale.

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:15.590
We get the audience involved,

01:08:15.623 --> 01:08:17.559
we plaster billboards
all over the country,

01:08:17.591 --> 01:08:19.327
and the next thing you know
we're back on top,

01:08:19.359 --> 01:08:20.563
just like that.
Say yes.

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:26.268
I'll talk to the network.
- No, no, no.

01:08:26.301 --> 01:08:27.703
I need a yes or a no.

01:08:29.904 --> 01:08:32.240
I'll convince them.
- Thank you.

01:09:33.902 --> 01:09:35.337
Hey.
- Hi.

01:09:35.368 --> 01:09:37.337
Uh, I forgot my run-down
for next week.

01:09:37.372 --> 01:09:40.709
You wouldn't happen to have
an extra one, would you?

01:09:40.742 --> 01:09:41.841
Oh.
- Yeah.

01:09:41.876 --> 01:09:44.444
Perfect. Thank you.

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:46.182
Good night.
- Good night.

01:10:00.996 --> 01:10:03.632
Little man,
I've got a quest--

01:10:09.837 --> 01:10:10.872
Hey, where's Elliot?

01:10:10.905 --> 01:10:12.673
He was transferred to
palliative last night.

01:10:12.707 --> 01:10:15.244
What?

01:10:19.881 --> 01:10:20.849
Sorry.

01:10:20.881 --> 01:10:22.283
Excuse me.

01:10:24.685 --> 01:10:26.322
Oh, no.

01:10:28.756 --> 01:10:30.291
What are you doing here?

01:10:31.826 --> 01:10:36.265
No, no, oh, no.
No. You get out.

01:10:36.297 --> 01:10:37.765
Please, can I just say goodbye?
- No.

01:10:37.798 --> 01:10:41.802
No, you cannot. I told them
to keep you away from him.

01:10:41.836 --> 01:10:43.639
Don't you think you have
done enough to screw up

01:10:43.671 --> 01:10:47.041
the last few weeks
of my son's life?

01:10:47.074 --> 01:10:49.344
He is 11 years old,
for God's sake.

01:10:49.377 --> 01:10:51.313
You had him talking
about nothing but death.

01:10:51.345 --> 01:10:53.481
That wasn't me, I promise you. I
tried to stop him from watching--

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:57.352
Fuck you! Fuck you,
you Satanist bitch!

01:10:57.385 --> 01:10:59.488
You brainwashed my son!

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:00.988
<i>- Please...
- You stole his innocence.</i>

01:11:01.021 --> 01:11:03.958
I love your son. I just want
to say goodbye to him--

01:11:03.992 --> 01:11:06.528
Get out! You get out!
You get out!

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.296
Get her out of here before I do!

01:11:08.329 --> 01:11:09.797
I'm sorry.

01:11:40.761 --> 01:11:41.764
Mr. Curtis?

01:11:43.265 --> 01:11:45.534
I spoke to a friend and he told me
you were a man who gets things done.

01:11:47.702 --> 01:11:50.639
I know you.
Mr. Washington, right?

01:11:50.671 --> 01:11:53.375
Yeah, you used to live
a few blocks away from here.

01:11:53.408 --> 01:11:56.712
Pretty wife, good job, a kid.

01:11:56.744 --> 01:11:59.414
Two now.
No job.

01:12:00.582 --> 01:12:01.883
You don't want
to be messing with me.

01:12:01.916 --> 01:12:03.518
No, no, no.
I don't want drugs.

01:12:03.551 --> 01:12:08.123
I hear that you loan money
to people in need sometimes.

01:12:08.155 --> 01:12:09.890
Not to people like you.

01:12:09.923 --> 01:12:11.726
Look, it's just a few thou.

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:15.063
I'll pay you back, man.
I promise.

01:12:15.095 --> 01:12:16.931
And what happens if you don't?

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:21.670
The streets ain't
for you no more.

01:12:21.703 --> 01:12:22.838
Drive.

01:12:47.828 --> 01:12:50.731
You're an abomination!

01:12:58.672 --> 01:13:02.676
Life is a gift!

01:13:02.710 --> 01:13:05.881
This is not the American way!

01:13:05.913 --> 01:13:08.849
Stop this madness!

01:13:13.454 --> 01:13:15.689
This is so wrong!

01:13:21.095 --> 01:13:23.899
<i>I'm here at the scene of
auditions for This Is Your Death.</i>

01:13:23.931 --> 01:13:25.900
There's a $1,000,000 prize.
But however,

01:13:25.934 --> 01:13:30.439
there are also allegations of faking
a death on a previous episode.

01:13:30.471 --> 01:13:31.939
We're hoping to find out
more today.

01:13:31.974 --> 01:13:34.676
As you know, we're running these
auditions throughout the country today,

01:13:34.708 --> 01:13:37.878
so there's no guarantee that
any of you will be selected.

01:13:37.912 --> 01:13:40.715
Our casting criteria
changes show by show,

01:13:40.747 --> 01:13:44.018
so all you need to do
is be yourselves

01:13:44.051 --> 01:13:47.154
and prove your willingness to go
through with your suicide on stage.

01:13:47.188 --> 01:13:49.658
Now, we're gonna set you up
with one of our psychiatrists

01:13:49.690 --> 01:13:52.126
who are gonna run you through
some questions. Cool?

01:13:55.930 --> 01:13:58.533
Gentlemen, the FBI can ask
questions all day long,

01:13:58.565 --> 01:14:00.702
but neither Sylvia nor Adam
nor any of the crew

01:14:00.734 --> 01:14:03.771
are gonna talk until charges,
if any, are pressed.

01:14:03.805 --> 01:14:05.106
Are we clear?

01:14:08.576 --> 01:14:10.212
You'll be hearing from us.

01:14:10.244 --> 01:14:11.979
Thank you, guys.

01:14:17.985 --> 01:14:20.154
What the fuck was that?!

01:14:34.801 --> 01:14:37.139
Well, this is awkward.

01:14:39.274 --> 01:14:40.576
Adam, can I talk to you?

01:14:40.609 --> 01:14:43.011
<i>Uh, no. I'm late for my New
York Standard interview.</i>

01:14:43.043 --> 01:14:45.646
I know that you lied to me
about that woman in the car.

01:14:47.081 --> 01:14:49.518
I lied to you?
Uh, no, I didn't.

01:14:49.551 --> 01:14:50.652
She died on stage.

01:14:51.886 --> 01:14:53.889
The car cameras were
still rolling.

01:14:56.591 --> 01:14:58.227
I saw the tape.

01:15:01.029 --> 01:15:02.498
I know that you killed her.

01:15:05.699 --> 01:15:09.203
Yet you didn't report me, which
makes you an accomplice.

01:15:11.573 --> 01:15:14.309
Jesus.
What happened to you?

01:15:14.341 --> 01:15:17.211
I built this show, Sylvia.

01:15:17.244 --> 01:15:18.613
And I'm not gonna let it die

01:15:18.645 --> 01:15:22.317
because some pussy
had second thoughts.

01:15:22.350 --> 01:15:23.886
Now...

01:15:26.087 --> 01:15:28.023
Did you delete the footage?

01:15:30.291 --> 01:15:31.592
Of course.

01:15:32.827 --> 01:15:36.297
Good. Good.
Adam, call for you on two.

01:15:36.331 --> 01:15:39.134
Take a message.
- It's your sister.

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:41.603
Then definitely take a message.

01:15:41.636 --> 01:15:43.238
It sounds bad, man.

01:15:56.283 --> 01:15:58.619
Karina, what is it?

01:15:58.653 --> 01:16:01.590
<i>Do you remember when
we were kids</i>

01:16:01.622 --> 01:16:05.159
and you
pretended to be a monster?

01:16:05.193 --> 01:16:07.061
What?

01:16:07.095 --> 01:16:09.798
<i>One minute you were
my big brother.</i>

01:16:09.831 --> 01:16:13.301
<i>You were my hero.
And then you--</i>

01:16:13.333 --> 01:16:18.072
You were possessed
and I was so scared.

01:16:19.239 --> 01:16:22.710
I was so scared...

01:16:22.743 --> 01:16:24.878
and I cried and cried and cried.

01:16:24.912 --> 01:16:26.113
Okay, Karina.

01:16:26.146 --> 01:16:28.716
Karina, I have to get to an
interview right now, okay?

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:29.818
I'll talk to you later.

01:16:29.850 --> 01:16:31.853
I got fired today.

01:16:31.886 --> 01:16:33.688
<i>- What?
- Don't be mad.</i>

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:35.155
What-- what'd you do?

01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:39.159
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.

01:16:39.193 --> 01:16:41.063
I just wanted to relax.

01:16:43.831 --> 01:16:45.967
<i>You're high right now, aren't you?</i>

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.270
Goddammit. Sis,
those kids needed you!

01:16:49.302 --> 01:16:51.206
<i>You needed them.</i>

01:16:51.238 --> 01:16:53.641
The kids didn't need me.

01:16:53.675 --> 01:16:58.680
<i>I was the stupid sister
of a satanic TV host.</i>

01:16:58.712 --> 01:17:02.182
<i>- That's you. You're satanic.
- Okay.</i>

01:17:02.216 --> 01:17:05.020
Okay, sober up.

01:17:05.052 --> 01:17:07.389
Call your sponsor,
and then your therapist,

01:17:07.421 --> 01:17:09.156
and then we'll talk
about this together,

01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:11.792
after the finale, all right?

01:17:11.826 --> 01:17:13.127
Yeah.

01:17:15.829 --> 01:17:17.731
Dammit!

01:17:17.765 --> 01:17:19.868
Perfect.

01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:24.139
Uh, I'm not sure
we can do this on stage.

01:17:24.171 --> 01:17:25.739
One sec.

01:17:25.773 --> 01:17:27.141
Yeah, I need to talk to Sylvia.

01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:32.180
Hi, Zach.

01:17:32.212 --> 01:17:34.381
He wants to what?

01:17:34.414 --> 01:17:36.083
Adam, we need to talk
about the season finale.

01:17:36.117 --> 01:17:37.318
It can wait.

01:17:37.351 --> 01:17:42.791
Uh, no, it can't wait because
it is the season finale.

01:17:42.823 --> 01:17:44.692
Adam!
- Sylvia, it can wait.

01:17:44.725 --> 01:17:46.894
No, it can't. We are about
to interview call-backs

01:17:46.927 --> 01:17:48.095
and I need your input.

01:17:48.128 --> 01:17:50.064
I'm sorry, what's your title again?
It's producer, right?

01:17:50.097 --> 01:17:52.199
So why don't you
fucking produce?

01:17:52.233 --> 01:17:53.802
You know where we stand
in the ratings,

01:17:53.835 --> 01:17:55.837
you know what we need
to do, now get it done.

01:18:16.323 --> 01:18:18.025
<i>- L'chaim.
- Wh--</i>

01:18:19.894 --> 01:18:22.262
What?

01:18:22.296 --> 01:18:25.432
It's-- it's what the
Jewish kids say at school.

01:18:25.466 --> 01:18:27.902
It means "to life".

01:18:27.935 --> 01:18:29.437
I like it.

01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:31.472
<i>- L'chaim, then.
- L'chaim.</i>

01:18:34.942 --> 01:18:35.976
Mmm!

01:18:36.010 --> 01:18:37.746
Just a sip now, Derrick.

01:18:37.779 --> 01:18:39.414
I'm cool, ma.
I'm cool.

01:18:39.447 --> 01:18:42.016
Daddy, what's your job?

01:18:42.048 --> 01:18:44.252
Go on, explain it to her, honey.

01:18:44.284 --> 01:18:46.186
Yeah, I'm junior head of sales

01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:48.757
for Southern California
Whirlpool.

01:18:48.789 --> 01:18:51.126
Doesn't that sound so good?
- Yeah.

01:18:51.158 --> 01:18:54.061
It's gonna be just like
the good old days.

01:18:54.095 --> 01:18:56.231
Except even better.

01:18:58.365 --> 01:18:59.900
Excuse me a minute.

01:19:42.176 --> 01:19:44.145
Hey. Uh, Adam's gone.

01:19:44.177 --> 01:19:47.015
That's okay, I wanted
to talk to you.

01:19:47.047 --> 01:19:50.050
Oh, okay.
What's up?

01:19:50.083 --> 01:19:53.354
<i>I've made a decision
and I need your help.</i>

01:19:53.386 --> 01:19:56.023
<i>But I need you to promise
this stays between us.</i>

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.369
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

01:20:08.402 --> 01:20:09.570
I knew you were trying your best

01:20:09.604 --> 01:20:11.372
while I was just
working part time.

01:20:11.404 --> 01:20:14.442
Oh, please. Please.

01:20:14.475 --> 01:20:18.179
You were just raising
a beautiful family.

01:20:18.212 --> 01:20:21.449
You're doing a great job
with these children.

01:20:21.481 --> 01:20:25.286
You know that's more important
than any job out there.

01:20:25.319 --> 01:20:27.055
I mean it.

01:20:27.087 --> 01:20:29.256
Eve, come here.
They're in here.

01:20:30.658 --> 01:20:31.993
Ta-da!

01:20:35.029 --> 01:20:38.533
Is this like an all-expenses
paid business trip, pops?

01:20:38.565 --> 01:20:40.902
Yes, sir.

01:20:40.935 --> 01:20:43.571
I gotta go get trained up.

01:20:43.604 --> 01:20:46.908
I gotta catch up on
the new technologies.

01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:48.309
Now, you, um...

01:20:48.341 --> 01:20:51.945
you listen to your mother
while I'm gone, all right?

01:20:51.979 --> 01:20:55.283
And you both work hard,
especially you.

01:20:55.315 --> 01:20:57.853
You hear?
- We hear.

01:21:03.224 --> 01:21:05.126
Hey, Dad.

01:21:05.158 --> 01:21:08.629
I forgot to tell you, the 17th
president of the United States was,

01:21:08.662 --> 01:21:10.598
um, Andrew Johnson.

01:21:12.533 --> 01:21:16.438
That's right, son.
Good job.

01:21:40.394 --> 01:21:41.997
Hey, guys, start rolling.

01:21:45.365 --> 01:21:48.336
Mr. Washington, hi.
I'm Sylvia.

01:21:48.368 --> 01:21:49.938
I'm the show's producer.

01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:52.439
Pleased to meet you,
Miss Sylvia.

01:21:52.472 --> 01:21:55.976
Are you ready?

01:21:56.010 --> 01:22:00.381
You know, I'd be lying
if I said yes.

01:22:00.413 --> 01:22:02.250
I know what I gotta do.

01:22:03.317 --> 01:22:05.653
Let's take a walk.

01:22:05.685 --> 01:22:07.354
You're from L.A.,
right?

01:22:07.387 --> 01:22:08.389
Yeah.

01:22:08.422 --> 01:22:11.091
Yeah, I grew up a few
blocks from here, actually.

01:22:11.125 --> 01:22:13.694
Oh.

01:22:13.728 --> 01:22:16.463
I used to play on
these tracks as kids.

01:22:37.184 --> 01:22:39.087
Two and three I want you
bouncing off each other.

01:22:39.119 --> 01:22:40.988
One on cue,
stay right under the jib.

01:22:41.021 --> 01:22:42.023
FBI.

01:22:42.056 --> 01:22:44.524
We have a warrant to obtain
footage immediately.

01:22:44.557 --> 01:22:46.094
We're on air in 30 minutes.

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:47.462
Can this wait until
after the show?

01:22:47.494 --> 01:22:48.628
I'm afraid not.

01:22:48.662 --> 01:22:50.698
We need all camera feeds
from episode 119.

01:22:50.730 --> 01:22:52.233
That's five terabytes.

01:22:52.265 --> 01:22:53.734
You're talking about
at least two hours.

01:22:53.768 --> 01:22:55.136
There's a waiting area
in the hallway.

01:22:55.170 --> 01:22:57.704
Why don't you gentlemen make
yourselves comfortable over there?

01:22:57.738 --> 01:23:00.108
Thank you so much.
Appreciate it.

01:23:03.743 --> 01:23:05.313
What the fuck was that
about, Ilana?

01:23:05.345 --> 01:23:06.546
That was the car
exhaust episode.

01:23:06.579 --> 01:23:08.283
Don't worry about it.
We're fine.

01:23:14.255 --> 01:23:16.324
...55, 54,

01:23:16.356 --> 01:23:18.158
53...

01:23:18.192 --> 01:23:21.061
Hurrah!
Let's make a change!

01:23:21.095 --> 01:23:22.296
Hurrah!

01:23:22.328 --> 01:23:23.530
Let's make a change!

01:23:23.564 --> 01:23:25.066
Hurrah!

01:23:25.099 --> 01:23:26.434
Let's make a change!

01:23:32.338 --> 01:23:34.609
You still have time
to change your mind.

01:23:42.582 --> 01:23:45.185
Chiro?
It's time.

01:23:55.095 --> 01:23:57.531
And Mason, we're gonna
need you ready in 10.

01:24:25.725 --> 01:24:28.429
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

01:24:28.462 --> 01:24:29.697
<i>Honey, who is it?</i>

01:24:29.729 --> 01:24:32.599
<i>I don't know,
I can't tell. Hello?</i>

01:24:32.632 --> 01:24:35.269
<i>- Derrick, get the phone from your sister.
- What up?</i>

01:24:35.301 --> 01:24:37.704
<i>Do not answer the phone
"what up".</i>

01:24:37.738 --> 01:24:39.440
<i>I thought I taught you
better than that.</i>

01:24:39.472 --> 01:24:40.875
<i>There's no one there.</i>

01:24:40.908 --> 01:24:44.112
<i>- Yes, there is.
- No, there isn't.</i>

01:24:44.145 --> 01:24:46.414
<i>Mom, there's no one there.
Eve's just playing.</i>

01:24:46.447 --> 01:24:48.615
<i>No, I'm not.
Don't call me a liar.</i>

01:24:48.649 --> 01:24:52.887
<i>- I'm not a liar, I promise.
- Okay, okay, sis, relax.</i>

01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:56.257
<i>Go brush your teeth and I'll
read you a story, a'ight?</i>

01:24:56.289 --> 01:24:59.226
<i>All right, not a'ight.</i>

01:26:23.877 --> 01:26:25.446
Didn't I tell you
this was going to be

01:26:25.479 --> 01:26:27.548
the most memorable show ever?

01:26:27.581 --> 01:26:30.851
<i>You just witnessed
a traditional Hari Kari,</i>

01:26:30.884 --> 01:26:32.819
and that was just the beginning.

01:26:32.853 --> 01:26:34.322
<i>Stay with us.</i>

01:26:53.673 --> 01:26:56.911
I'm Karina.
I'm up next.

01:27:01.849 --> 01:27:03.418
Mason Washington.

01:27:08.354 --> 01:27:09.957
And I'm scared as hell.

01:27:13.527 --> 01:27:14.695
Yeah.

01:27:17.765 --> 01:27:22.270
Don't worry.
It'll be over soon.

01:27:39.019 --> 01:27:41.655
Mason, can I ask why
you're doing this?

01:27:47.328 --> 01:27:51.766
I'm trying to save my family.

01:27:51.798 --> 01:27:52.934
And you?

01:27:53.966 --> 01:27:55.034
Same.

01:27:58.471 --> 01:28:00.907
Karina, we are ready for you.

01:28:17.524 --> 01:28:19.927
All right, people, we got a
public hanging coming up next.

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:22.630
So I want lots of-- -
We are tracking off the charts.

01:28:22.662 --> 01:28:24.831
The network is calling
you my protégé.

01:28:24.864 --> 01:28:26.367
I'm proud of you, kiddo.

01:28:26.399 --> 01:28:27.868
I would hold that sentiment.

01:28:29.636 --> 01:28:31.472
All right, guys, we've got
a change of plans tonight.

01:28:31.505 --> 01:28:32.806
The hanging man dropped out.

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.007
Oh.

01:28:34.041 --> 01:28:37.445
And you didn't think to tell me
until one minute beforehand?

01:28:37.478 --> 01:28:38.779
Well, I did,
but I decided not to.

01:28:38.811 --> 01:28:40.381
It will not be a lot
of movement,

01:28:40.413 --> 01:28:44.050
just center stage and here's
Adam's prompter script.

01:28:44.083 --> 01:28:45.485
Should I be concerned?

01:28:45.519 --> 01:28:47.088
You probably should be, yeah.

01:28:47.121 --> 01:28:49.523
<i>Welcome back
to the season finale</i>

01:28:49.555 --> 01:28:52.025
<i>of This Is Your Death!</i>

01:28:52.059 --> 01:28:55.896
<i>Your host, Adam Rogers!</i>

01:28:55.929 --> 01:28:58.565
<i>Here, on This Is Your Death,</i>

01:28:58.599 --> 01:29:00.768
we have been on a mission
all season long,

01:29:00.801 --> 01:29:04.004
a mission to wake this country
out of its complacency,

01:29:04.037 --> 01:29:05.539
out of its slumber,

01:29:05.572 --> 01:29:08.676
to experience the
reality of the real,

01:29:08.708 --> 01:29:10.677
and tonight is no exception.

01:29:14.715 --> 01:29:17.451
Please welcome our next
brave guest,

01:29:17.484 --> 01:29:21.088
Karina R-- What?

01:29:21.121 --> 01:29:24.759
Keller, cue this video.

01:29:24.792 --> 01:29:26.927
Don't.
- Cue the video, Keller.

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:28.662
<i>This is my crew
and it is my show.</i>

01:29:28.694 --> 01:29:31.164
If you cue that video, Keller,
there will be no show!

01:29:31.198 --> 01:29:33.501
No season two, no syndication,

01:29:33.533 --> 01:29:35.835
no international sales, nothing!

01:29:35.868 --> 01:29:38.805
Good! May I remind everyone
that we are still live?

01:29:38.838 --> 01:29:40.807
<i>Keller? -
This is a joke, right?</i>

01:29:40.841 --> 01:29:42.843
<i>Somebody tell me
what's going on.</i>

01:29:44.011 --> 01:29:46.046
<i>- Goddammit.
- My name is...</i>

01:29:46.078 --> 01:29:48.416
<i>- Uh, Karina Rogers.
- Are you kidding me?</i>

01:29:48.448 --> 01:29:50.650
<i>I'm the little sister
of Adam Rogers,</i>

01:29:50.684 --> 01:29:53.855
<i>the host and co-creator
of the show.</i>

01:29:55.456 --> 01:29:57.992
<i>- What is this?
- Adam and I were closer than most siblings,</i>

01:29:58.024 --> 01:29:59.926
<i>I think, growing up.</i>

01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:02.061
<i>Um, our parents were killed
by a drunk driver</i>

01:30:02.095 --> 01:30:04.865
<i>- when I was 15 and Adam was 20.
- Karina? Karina, no.</i>

01:30:04.898 --> 01:30:08.502
<i>- Adam just dropped everything to take care of me.
- No! Kar-- hey.</i>

01:30:08.534 --> 01:30:10.537
<i>- Sylvia!
- I developed...</i>

01:30:10.570 --> 01:30:13.606
<i>- Karina!
- ...clinical depression.</i>

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:16.477
<i>- It sucks.
- Karina! Karina!</i>

01:30:16.510 --> 01:30:18.679
You're a monster.
- Sylvia!

01:30:18.712 --> 01:30:20.948
No, I'm your protégé, remember?

01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:24.217
What, Bernie?

01:30:24.251 --> 01:30:26.753
Listen to me, I got the entire
board on the line here.

01:30:26.787 --> 01:30:29.623
Please, God, tell me
this is a joke.

01:30:29.655 --> 01:30:32.827
<i>...believing he could
change the world.</i>

01:30:32.859 --> 01:30:35.028
<i>He did, I guess.</i>

01:30:35.061 --> 01:30:39.934
<i>Just not the way he intended.</i>

01:30:39.966 --> 01:30:41.801
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

01:30:41.835 --> 01:30:43.971
<i>- Stop this! Stop her!
- I'm doing this for myself.</i>

01:30:44.003 --> 01:30:46.506
<i>- Hey!
- And I'm doing it for Adam.</i>

01:30:46.539 --> 01:30:49.109
<i>And I'm doing it for all of you.</i>

01:30:49.141 --> 01:30:54.747
<i>None of you are watching me
to feel empathy,</i>

01:30:54.780 --> 01:31:00.887
<i>or to be shocked back
into reality.</i>

01:31:00.921 --> 01:31:05.592
<i>You're watching me to see
how I'll off myself.</i>

01:31:05.626 --> 01:31:08.596
I hope I'm the last one.

01:31:08.628 --> 01:31:11.131
Karina! Hey!

01:31:11.163 --> 01:31:13.567
Somebody back there, stop her!

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:15.803
Hey! Hey!

01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:18.472
Don't let her do it!

01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:31.618
Back up!

01:31:46.065 --> 01:31:48.202
No! No!

01:31:48.234 --> 01:31:51.771
What're you doing?
What're you doing?

01:31:51.805 --> 01:31:54.842
Somebody call 911!

01:31:54.875 --> 01:31:57.545
Please...
- Tell me, what are you doing?!

01:31:57.578 --> 01:31:59.647
Somebody call 911!

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:03.584
Look... I'm gonna miss you.
- You're all I have left.

01:32:03.617 --> 01:32:05.085
You're the only person
in this world I got left.

01:32:05.118 --> 01:32:07.555
I'm gonna miss you. You're okay.
- What're you doing?

01:32:07.587 --> 01:32:10.224
You're gonna be okay.
- No, no, no!

01:32:10.256 --> 01:32:12.192
No, no, no, no, no!

01:32:12.225 --> 01:32:15.096
No! No!

01:32:29.676 --> 01:32:32.146
Karina. Karina.

01:32:44.890 --> 01:32:47.027
Are you happy now?!

01:32:47.060 --> 01:32:49.330
Did you get what you wanted?!

01:32:49.363 --> 01:32:51.666
Are you happy now?!

01:32:54.734 --> 01:32:56.836
Get her out of here.

01:32:56.869 --> 01:32:58.671
I'm going on my own.

01:32:58.704 --> 01:33:02.175
Keller, you are in charge.

01:33:02.208 --> 01:33:04.845
Don't say anything, just do
your job and finish this, okay?

01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:12.585
Cue the VO and cut
to commercial.

01:33:14.253 --> 01:33:16.689
<i>We'll be right back
after these messages</i>

01:33:16.722 --> 01:33:21.028
<i>for the grand finale
of This Is Your Death!</i>

01:33:32.305 --> 01:33:34.041
It's time.

01:34:08.007 --> 01:34:09.777
Let me go with her!

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:11.412
Let me go with--
What are you doing?

01:34:16.949 --> 01:34:19.086
<i>This next act
involves explosives,</i>

01:34:19.118 --> 01:34:23.023
<i>so everyone please
insert your earplugs.</i>

01:34:23.055 --> 01:34:24.824
We're on in five seconds.

01:34:24.858 --> 01:34:25.926
Four.

01:34:25.958 --> 01:34:27.127
Three.

01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:32.966
<i>I grew up a few
blocks from here, actually.</i>

01:34:32.998 --> 01:34:35.969
<i>We used to play
on these tracks as kids.</i>

01:34:38.305 --> 01:34:40.807
<i>I knew all the steam engines.</i>

01:34:40.841 --> 01:34:42.076
<i>I remember one day
in particular,</i>

01:34:42.109 --> 01:34:44.411
<i>an old JB-36 steam engine
was rolling through...</i>

01:34:44.444 --> 01:34:45.880
Mason.

01:34:48.215 --> 01:34:49.350
You know him?

01:34:51.118 --> 01:34:53.754
He used to clean
our offices, yeah.

01:34:59.059 --> 01:35:01.762
<i>That's what we did to have fun.</i>

01:35:01.795 --> 01:35:03.497
<i>And my childhood was
the kind you lived through</i>

01:35:03.529 --> 01:35:05.965
<i>without ever thinking
there was a way out.</i>

01:35:13.539 --> 01:35:15.208
The point is,

01:35:15.242 --> 01:35:17.277
I made a promise

01:35:17.310 --> 01:35:20.013
<i>that if I were to ever
have kids,</i>

01:35:20.046 --> 01:35:22.015
<i>someone to be responsible for,</i>

01:35:22.047 --> 01:35:24.484
<i>they wouldn't have to grow up
in a place like this.</i>

01:35:27.119 --> 01:35:28.823
<i>You know what?</i>

01:35:30.923 --> 01:35:33.260
<i>I did it.
I found a job.</i>

01:35:35.462 --> 01:35:38.165
<i>Got my wife and kids
into a good neighborhood,</i>

01:35:38.198 --> 01:35:42.168
<i>and then that job evaporated
with the economy,</i>

01:35:42.202 --> 01:35:45.038
<i>and I haven't been able
to land anything just to--</i>

01:35:45.070 --> 01:35:49.009
Just to make ends meet,
you know?

01:35:53.246 --> 01:35:57.851
All I want to do is work,
be a good father...

01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:03.323
a good husband...

01:36:03.355 --> 01:36:06.426
but I... I'm out of ideas.

01:36:07.927 --> 01:36:09.930
I'm at the end of my rope.

01:36:11.398 --> 01:36:13.367
<i>And I made a promise.</i>

01:36:16.168 --> 01:36:18.005
<i>So I'm here.</i>

01:37:51.931 --> 01:37:53.300
No!

01:37:53.332 --> 01:37:56.036
I'm sorry, I can't do it!

01:37:56.069 --> 01:37:58.472
I can't do it.

01:37:58.505 --> 01:38:01.442
I don't want your money.

01:38:03.009 --> 01:38:07.081
Wha-- what am I doing?

01:38:10.684 --> 01:38:13.554
I love my family.

01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:17.358
I love my life.

01:38:18.358 --> 01:38:19.960
I won't do it.

01:38:19.993 --> 01:38:22.195
I won't.

01:38:22.228 --> 01:38:24.030
What are you doing?

01:38:24.064 --> 01:38:27.935
What-- what are you watching?

01:38:29.234 --> 01:38:31.570
I just--
I just wanna go home.

01:38:34.207 --> 01:38:36.510
<i>Can't we just turn it off?</i>

01:38:37.711 --> 01:38:41.181
Can't we all just go home?

01:38:53.659 --> 01:38:55.729
We love you, Mason!

01:38:55.761 --> 01:38:57.630
Yeah!

01:39:08.307 --> 01:39:09.243
Cue the final music.

01:39:09.275 --> 01:39:11.545
Let's get this fucking
show over with.

01:39:11.578 --> 01:39:13.681
Mason! Mason! Mason!

01:39:30.596 --> 01:39:33.500
Just give me a second.

01:39:33.533 --> 01:39:35.202
It's all on there.

01:39:35.234 --> 01:39:37.670
He threatened me if I spoke,
but it doesn't matter anymore.

01:40:07.533 --> 01:40:09.135
There he is!
There's Mason!

01:40:09.168 --> 01:40:10.537
Hey, Mason!

01:40:13.172 --> 01:40:16.609
Right here!
Right here, Mason!

01:40:16.643 --> 01:40:19.413
You let this--

01:40:23.850 --> 01:40:25.285
It's you.

01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:50.342
Please stop.

01:40:50.376 --> 01:40:52.412
Get your cameras out of my face.

01:40:52.444 --> 01:40:53.412
Please, stop it!

01:40:53.445 --> 01:40:55.815
Shut it off!

01:40:55.849 --> 01:40:58.518
Shut it off!

01:40:58.551 --> 01:41:00.187
What is wrong with you?

01:41:05.492 --> 01:41:07.627
You're animals!

01:41:07.659 --> 01:41:09.128
You're fucking animals!

01:41:09.162 --> 01:41:11.664
Shut off your cameras!
Shut them off!

01:41:13.132 --> 01:41:14.467
Shut them off!
- Let's go!

01:41:14.501 --> 01:41:16.103
Shut them off!
