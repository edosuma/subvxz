00:07.007 --> 00:09.218
(thunder rumbles)

00:11.094 --> 00:12.763
(Max coos)

00:35.035 --> 00:37.287
(Max wailing)

00:49.174 --> 00:51.760
(shushes)

00:53.136 --> 00:54.471
Dad will be back soon.

00:54.471 --> 00:57.474
(shushes continues)

00:57.474 --> 00:58.684
(crying)

00:58.684 --> 01:01.603
(humming)

01:13.156 --> 01:15.576
(crying continues)

01:23.917 --> 01:25.210
Please, Maxy.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.504
Maxy, for mommy, please?

01:28.130 --> 01:29.214
Please, Max.

01:31.008 --> 01:33.594
(screams)

01:33.594 --> 01:36.555
(Maxy wailing)

01:46.607 --> 01:48.609
(muffled cry)

01:51.069 --> 01:53.280
(breathes shakily)

01:55.782 --> 01:56.867
(gasps)

01:56.867 --> 01:58.201
WOMAN: Watch where you're going!

01:59.494 --> 02:01.622
(breathes heavily)

02:02.748 --> 02:04.750
(dramatic music playing)

02:13.634 --> 02:14.926
(panting)

02:15.594 --> 02:16.720
MAN: What's he doing?

02:19.097 --> 02:20.057
(grunts)

02:21.975 --> 02:23.018
(grunts)

02:24.144 --> 02:27.856
- (drill whirring)
- (siren wails in distance)

02:29.566 --> 02:30.692
WAYNE: Maxine?

02:31.318 --> 02:32.569
Maxine!

02:33.779 --> 02:34.946
(glass shatters)

02:35.989 --> 02:36.990
(tool clanks)

02:38.742 --> 02:40.661
Maxine, here we go.

02:40.994 --> 02:41.995
Stay.

02:43.413 --> 02:46.041
- (tires screech)
- (siren blaring)

02:48.627 --> 02:50.087
(door opens, closes)

02:51.922 --> 02:53.090
WAYNE: She's not moving.

02:56.468 --> 02:57.552
I'll follow you.

03:00.389 --> 03:02.599
(dramatic music playing)

03:12.317 --> 03:15.278
(theme music playing)

03:43.390 --> 03:44.474
(knife clanks)

03:48.562 --> 03:50.689
Billy, are you dressed yet?

03:55.485 --> 03:57.612
BILLY: Mom, there's a man outside.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.159
Stay away from the windows.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.496
What are you doing on my property?

04:06.496 --> 04:07.539
Hi, I'm Devon.

04:07.539 --> 04:09.958
We tried going through the agent,
but they never called back.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.210
We're just wondering,
could we measure the second bedroom?

04:14.337 --> 04:16.715
I'm sorry, who, who are you?

04:16.923 --> 04:17.966
Devon.

04:17.966 --> 04:21.094
- Oh, sorry, we're the new owners.
- Hi, I'm Lou.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.096
Yeah, we know settlement
is not for another 90 days.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.973
LOU: We have to buy furniture
for the nursery.

04:24.973 --> 04:27.225
Yeah, the agent forgot to put
the dimensions on the floorplan.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.518
We'll be really, really quick.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.897
Leave now, or I'm calling the cops.

04:33.607 --> 04:34.441
(door slams)

04:34.441 --> 04:36.359
BILLY: Mom, who are those people?

04:37.736 --> 04:41.406
Um, they just had
the wrong house, sweetheart.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.036
Grab your bag, Billy.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.753
Why are we here so early?

04:54.753 --> 04:55.796
Sylvie!

04:56.254 --> 04:57.672
- Hi.
- Hi, Freya.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.549
- Hi, Billy.
- Hi.

04:59.549 --> 05:02.385
Hey, can Billy wait with you
in the classroom until the bell goes?

05:02.385 --> 05:03.470
I have an urgent appointment,

05:03.470 --> 05:06.097
and I really don't want him
in the playground on his own.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.517
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay, great.

05:08.517 --> 05:11.478
Um, also, I'm the only one authorized
to pick him up, right?

05:11.478 --> 05:14.648
Yes. It's all on file
in your Parental Authority form.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.316
- Okay, great.
- Yeah.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.776
(smooches)
Have a great day.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.361
Okay, thanks.

05:19.361 --> 05:20.612
Right, come on Billy.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.573
HENRIK (on phone): Why did you call me?

05:23.573 --> 05:25.575
ADRIENNE: I always look after my own.

05:26.284 --> 05:30.705
The light shines brightest on those
who walk through darkness, Henrik.

05:31.540 --> 05:32.541
I have to go.

05:32.541 --> 05:33.708
The nurse is here.

05:34.084 --> 05:35.669
- Stay strong.
- Maitreya...

05:38.588 --> 05:41.967
- Did you sell my house?
- Oh, it's only you.

05:41.967 --> 05:44.678
- Did you sell it?
- I think you mean my house.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.847
Why was there a man in my front yard
with a tape measure

05:46.847 --> 05:48.431
wanting to turn Billy's room
into a nursery?

05:48.431 --> 05:51.184
I have no idea what you're talking about.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.353
(knocking)

05:53.353 --> 05:55.647
MO: Knock-knock! Mrs. Beaufort!

05:55.647 --> 05:57.566
I believe that's my cue.

05:59.985 --> 06:00.861
HANNAH: And...

06:02.320 --> 06:07.450
one, two, three, four, five, six...

06:07.450 --> 06:09.077
(retching)

06:09.828 --> 06:11.329
HANNAH: The rest of you keep going.

06:11.830 --> 06:15.333
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.376
Change.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.421
Amy, how'd it go?

06:20.088 --> 06:21.715
- Your clearing?
- HANNAH (shouts): Anton!

06:23.258 --> 06:25.093
(car approaching)

06:30.265 --> 06:31.641
I can't remember any of it.

06:32.309 --> 06:33.602
But you did go through, right?

06:34.394 --> 06:35.395
I think so.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.730
You'd know if you did.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.483
Anton, what happens if it didn't work?

06:40.483 --> 06:42.527
Then you have to keep doing it over again
until it does.

06:42.527 --> 06:43.653
(car door closes)

06:43.653 --> 06:46.197
It took me three goes
but it was worth it to change my life.

06:46.823 --> 06:47.741
How?

06:47.741 --> 06:49.826
(soft dramatic music)

07:01.338 --> 07:02.255
ADAM: Where's Asha?

07:02.255 --> 07:03.715
Asha was never one of us.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.136
(soft dramatic music)

07:20.315 --> 07:22.317
(birds chirping)

07:30.784 --> 07:31.868
FREYA: Hello?

07:37.707 --> 07:38.792
Dr. Latham?

07:44.714 --> 07:46.716
(ominous music)

07:53.848 --> 07:54.808
Hello?

07:56.309 --> 07:57.268
Bryce?

07:58.144 --> 07:59.020
Anyone here?

08:03.608 --> 08:06.569
KIDS (singing):
♪ Close the door, light the light ♪

08:06.569 --> 08:09.072
♪ We're staying home tonight ♪

08:09.072 --> 08:13.618
ADRIENNE: These children
are our Kindred, all of us.

08:15.161 --> 08:19.290
KIDS: Mother, your love binds us together
as one family.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.217
(foreboding music)

09:03.293 --> 09:05.837
"Suffer the little children
to come unto me.

09:06.504 --> 09:12.552
History beckons and must be rewritten
over and over again."

09:13.178 --> 09:15.180
(ominous music)

09:25.815 --> 09:26.775
(Freya gasps)

09:26.775 --> 09:28.610
Well, this is a surprise.

09:31.154 --> 09:34.532
Twenty thousand students
passed before me, Amy.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.035
It's astounding, isn't it?

09:38.578 --> 09:40.663
All those impressionable young minds.

09:41.164 --> 09:42.832
My name is not Amy anymore.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.048
We can't change who we are.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.300
Why did you sell my house?

09:52.884 --> 09:53.885
Your house?

09:53.885 --> 09:56.429
You have power of attorney for Adrienne.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.850
You sold the house
where I live with my son.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.521
You mustn't allow possessions
to possess you, my dear.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.573
The material world is illusory.

10:16.908 --> 10:17.992
We know this.

10:19.244 --> 10:22.664
The nature of existence is spiritual.

10:24.499 --> 10:27.585
The change that is called death

10:28.795 --> 10:30.088
is coming to us all.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.508
But only some of us will survive it.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.343
She gave me that house.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.097
It's Billy's home.

10:40.557 --> 10:41.599
It's all he knows.

10:44.185 --> 10:47.230
- Where are we supposed to go?
- You think money grows on trees?

10:48.898 --> 10:50.233
We have expenses.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.987
Maitreya must be kept in the manner
to which she is accustomed.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.446
Why didn't anyone tell me?

10:58.825 --> 11:01.494
You must have known
this day was coming, Amy.

11:02.537 --> 11:05.081
You can't suck on Mommy's teat forever.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.586
(dramatic music playing)

11:20.096 --> 11:21.139
(bell clinging)

11:21.139 --> 11:23.474
I MISS ASHA. LAST NIGHT

11:32.650 --> 11:35.278
- (door opens)
- (key clanking)

11:39.073 --> 11:40.408
Didn't you hear the bell?

11:40.742 --> 11:41.743
Sorry, Aunty.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.042
(plates clanking)

11:57.050 --> 11:58.885
Do you know what Asha's doing
at home right now?

12:02.305 --> 12:04.182
Going to the fridge whenever she likes.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.561
When she feels hungry,
she just makes a sandwich.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.439
- Can she have biscuits?
- Or fruit.

12:12.023 --> 12:13.524
Whatever she likes.

12:23.660 --> 12:24.786
Get out.

12:25.203 --> 12:27.914
Get out!

12:28.581 --> 12:30.583
(dramatic music)

12:35.880 --> 12:37.340
(Amy grunts)

12:45.348 --> 12:47.350
(dramatic music continues)

12:50.603 --> 12:53.022
(birds chirping)

13:01.030 --> 13:02.490
I know the truth about Asha.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.203
Do you now?

13:09.998 --> 13:11.416
I know that you took her home.

13:12.333 --> 13:13.793
To a better place than this.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.381
I would be careful if I was you.

13:20.591 --> 13:22.343
You know, saying such things as this.

13:24.178 --> 13:25.263
Hmm.

13:42.780 --> 13:47.327
Henrik, when you took her back,
was the house really nice like she said?

13:50.163 --> 13:51.331
It was dark.

13:53.249 --> 13:56.085
We left her asleep on the doorstep.

13:58.463 --> 13:59.922
Do you think she's happy now?

14:07.347 --> 14:09.932
Asha made the wrong choice.

14:19.776 --> 14:22.403
LEILA: Mom, he keeps kicking me
under the table!

14:22.403 --> 14:24.030
DINA: That's enough, you two!

14:24.572 --> 14:26.115
- Yusuf!
- LEILA: Dude, don't!

14:26.949 --> 14:28.159
DINA: Dinner's on the table.

14:28.743 --> 14:31.454
PAUL: No, you always do this.
You always blame me for it.

14:31.871 --> 14:32.872
DINA: Yusuf!

14:38.503 --> 14:40.046
PAUL: She's pushing me around!

14:41.381 --> 14:44.425
- (in Arabic) Yusuf? We're waiting.
- Start without me.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.223
(breathes deeply)

14:53.643 --> 14:56.813
JOE (in English): One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.946
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

15:09.784 --> 15:12.745
- (bell dings)
- (horn honks)

15:13.788 --> 15:15.331
(telephone ringing)

15:16.290 --> 15:17.333
Inspector!

15:18.418 --> 15:20.420
The Kindred have got the Woodfield girl.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.546
We need to go in now.

15:22.213 --> 15:23.548
WILKES: You know, you're starting
to piss me off, Saad--

15:23.548 --> 15:24.590
JOE: Look.

15:25.216 --> 15:26.926
One new kid. Right age.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.010
It has to be her.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.887
We need that warrant.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.392
Pretty fucking blurry.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.272
(telephone ringing)

15:42.650 --> 15:43.943
(sighs)

15:49.907 --> 15:51.909
(dramatic music continues)

16:15.433 --> 16:18.060
(car approaching)

16:28.488 --> 16:29.572
ADRIENNE: Hello, Colin.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.324
Maitreya.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.658
What are you doing here?

16:33.075 --> 16:34.577
I thought you should know.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.331
They think we've got the McFetridge girl.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.209
But we don't, right?

16:42.752 --> 16:45.296
Detective Saad has an unhealthy fixation.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.300
You've done the right thing, Colin.

16:50.635 --> 16:51.594
Window.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.681
(gate creaks)

17:14.951 --> 17:17.370
(chain rattles)

17:30.424 --> 17:31.634
ADRIENNE: You've read this?

17:34.303 --> 17:35.638
It's very detailed.

17:37.265 --> 17:39.016
- If it were to get out, it would...
- Yes.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.232
Why was Colin Garrison here?

17:47.358 --> 17:48.401
Are they coming?

17:49.777 --> 17:51.028
The Blue Devils?

17:52.989 --> 17:54.532
(exhales deeply)

17:55.366 --> 17:57.660
Do you remember your first clearing,
Tamsin?

17:58.661 --> 18:01.956
You were a mousy housewife
with a very odd doll collection,

18:01.956 --> 18:04.458
living in your brilliant husband's shadow.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.338
Who taught you to fend for yourself?

18:10.006 --> 18:12.091
To study nursing? Get a job?

18:12.717 --> 18:14.635
Pay for the roof over your own head?

18:15.761 --> 18:17.388
Why do you think I brought you here?

18:18.389 --> 18:19.390
To grow.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.394
To learn how to give more and want less.

18:24.437 --> 18:27.064
To surround you
with the children you couldn't have.

18:27.064 --> 18:28.232
(sobs)

18:29.150 --> 18:31.027
And look how you've repaid me.

18:32.945 --> 18:33.863
(sighs)

18:37.658 --> 18:39.744
Perhaps I should turn you over
to the Devils.

18:39.744 --> 18:40.911
(gasps)

18:40.911 --> 18:42.830
Tell them you abducted Asha.

18:43.372 --> 18:46.292
That you were the midwife
who stole those newborns.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.920
That it's your signature
on the adoption papers.

18:50.379 --> 18:51.589
(shaky breathing)

18:58.179 --> 19:01.349
Now, now, now, now.

19:01.349 --> 19:05.436
- (Tamsin sobbing)
- (shushes)

19:11.150 --> 19:13.319
There will be a reckoning, Tamsin.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.739
One day I will come for you,

19:17.865 --> 19:22.453
and I will call in all the favors
I have bestowed upon you.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.000
Now send Amy in.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.170
Yes, Maitreya.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.257
(light music playing)

19:56.237 --> 19:58.447
(kids laugh in distance)

20:17.508 --> 20:18.718
(handbrake rattles)

20:23.097 --> 20:25.307
(ominous music)

20:35.109 --> 20:36.193
Hey!

20:36.694 --> 20:38.279
What are you doing?

20:38.279 --> 20:40.364
(panting)

20:40.364 --> 20:41.449
No!

20:41.449 --> 20:43.576
(car engine revs)

20:46.871 --> 20:49.707
- Why do I have to go early?
- Because I said so.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.960
(foreboding music playing)

21:20.905 --> 21:22.364
(exhales deeply)

21:30.372 --> 21:31.290
Why are we stopping?

21:31.957 --> 21:32.958
Wait here.

21:38.255 --> 21:39.507
- Listen...
- No, you listen to me.

21:39.507 --> 21:40.841
Do you want me to call the cops?

21:40.841 --> 21:42.885
- Amy, I just want to talk...
- I'm not Amy.

21:43.677 --> 21:44.637
Sorry.

21:45.262 --> 21:47.389
- Freya.
- How did you find me?

21:47.389 --> 21:49.642
- Christine said she saw you...
- Oh! Fucking Christine!

21:49.642 --> 21:50.768
Don't blame her.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.104
I checked her car GPS
and I found the school.

21:54.104 --> 21:55.731
Did you break into her car?

21:55.731 --> 21:57.691
No, I'm staying with her.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.945
You're staying with Christine?

22:01.654 --> 22:02.738
She offered.

22:03.781 --> 22:05.950
I could have you charged for stalking.

22:06.784 --> 22:07.952
You blocked my phone.

22:08.244 --> 22:09.286
What choice did I have?

22:09.286 --> 22:10.704
- Leave me alone.
- I can't.

22:11.747 --> 22:12.998
It's Max.

22:16.252 --> 22:17.294
We had a fight.

22:19.129 --> 22:21.674
She's taken off from school
and run off with her cousin's van.

22:21.966 --> 22:25.886
I thought maybe she's crossed the border,
gone looking for her mom.

22:29.515 --> 22:30.975
Has she been in contact?

22:34.728 --> 22:36.021
You'd tell me if she had?

22:42.778 --> 22:44.029
What was the fight about?

22:45.489 --> 22:46.574
What'd you do to her?

22:48.784 --> 22:50.202
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

22:50.202 --> 22:52.413
- After what you did?
- After what I...

22:54.206 --> 22:56.292
You're the one who left her
in the fucking car.

22:58.335 --> 22:59.795
And you still haven't learnt your lesson.

23:01.922 --> 23:02.923
You got a kid now?

23:02.923 --> 23:05.259
I won't let you ruin things for me, Wayne.

23:06.135 --> 23:08.512
I have moved on with my life.

23:10.723 --> 23:11.765
Is he mine?

23:13.100 --> 23:14.935
Think you're the only man I've been with?

23:14.935 --> 23:16.103
How old is he?

23:16.812 --> 23:18.397
You're not gonna get him.

23:23.152 --> 23:24.904
(exhales deeply, sniffles)

23:26.947 --> 23:28.115
Who was that?

23:30.868 --> 23:34.788
Billy, your friend at the school fence,
did she tell you her name?

23:36.749 --> 23:37.958
(sighs)

23:41.503 --> 23:43.505
(classical music playing)

23:56.602 --> 23:59.521
(chair screeches)

24:05.986 --> 24:07.071
What did Mommy want?

24:12.534 --> 24:14.119
I knew you hadn't gone through.

24:16.038 --> 24:17.665
She'll make you do it again for sure.

24:22.211 --> 24:23.170
Up, please.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.633
Hello, children.

24:28.384 --> 24:29.885
CHILDREN: Hello, Mommy.

24:30.427 --> 24:35.349
Today, because the sun is shining,
the birds are singing and Mommy loves you,

24:35.599 --> 24:37.977
we are all going on an excursion.

24:39.019 --> 24:41.021
A picnic by the lake!

24:41.772 --> 24:42.856
Won't that be fun?

24:55.744 --> 24:57.746
(birds whistling)

25:00.416 --> 25:01.750
ANGELA: What's a picnic?

25:02.209 --> 25:04.503
You sit on a blanket outside and eat food.

25:04.503 --> 25:05.713
- With Mommy?
- (shushes)

25:06.255 --> 25:07.673
Do you want her to change her mind?

25:08.465 --> 25:10.092
Why a picnic all of a sudden?

25:11.260 --> 25:12.678
Is she going away again?

25:14.930 --> 25:17.933
(Adrienne singing)

25:19.351 --> 25:20.644
Look over here.

25:32.823 --> 25:35.034
(singing continues)

25:39.496 --> 25:40.873
GIRL: Come over here.

25:45.210 --> 25:47.421
(humming)

25:49.548 --> 25:51.091
Isn't this divine?

25:52.593 --> 25:54.303
- BOY 1: That was good. That was good.
- BOY 2: Good.

25:54.636 --> 25:56.513
HENDRIK: Here. There you go.

25:56.513 --> 25:58.474
- ANABELLE: Ow.
- Yeah, that's it.

25:58.474 --> 26:00.017
Annabelle, are you all right?

26:00.017 --> 26:01.852
TAMSIN: Are you all right, Annabelle?
Get up!

26:02.227 --> 26:03.270
ADRIENNE: She's all right.

26:03.270 --> 26:04.521
- GIRL 2: Are you all right?
- ANNABELLE: Don't...

26:04.521 --> 26:06.565
- GIRL 3: Show me where it hurt.
- HANNAH: Dust her off.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.484
- BOY 1: Come on, get up.
- BOY 2: You slipped?

26:08.484 --> 26:10.694
(vocalizing)

26:10.694 --> 26:12.404
- GILR 4: Are you all right? Are you?
- TAMSIN: She's fine.

26:29.505 --> 26:31.507
(suspenseful music playing)

26:32.633 --> 26:34.134
(clacking and whirring)

27:10.921 --> 27:12.548
(pants)

27:14.341 --> 27:15.300
Three, four, five,

27:15.300 --> 27:16.844
- six, seven, eight, nine.
- What are you doing?

27:16.844 --> 27:17.928
There's one missing.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.013
- What do you mean?
- There should be 10.

27:21.390 --> 27:22.432
Tamsin.

27:23.559 --> 27:24.685
There's one missing.

27:28.063 --> 27:29.648
Children, come here!

27:29.648 --> 27:31.775
(bell ringing)

27:31.775 --> 27:33.318
HENRIK: Up, up. Let's go.

27:33.318 --> 27:34.528
What's going on?

27:35.028 --> 27:36.196
TAMSIN: There's one missing.

27:36.196 --> 27:37.823
HANNAH: It's probably nothing, Maitreya.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.741
Two lines in front of me, now.

27:40.909 --> 27:43.579
- It's Amy.
- She's in so much trouble.

27:43.954 --> 27:46.206
Hannah, did she go back to the house?

27:46.707 --> 27:47.666
I didn't see her.

27:47.666 --> 27:48.792
You were supposed to be watching her.

27:48.792 --> 27:50.335
- I was. I didn't--
- ADRIENNE: Find her.

27:51.962 --> 27:53.881
Tamsin, take the others back
to the house at once.

27:54.590 --> 27:55.591
Come with me.

27:56.550 --> 27:57.593
HENRIK: Amy!

27:58.218 --> 27:59.219
HANNAH: Amy!

28:01.597 --> 28:02.639
Amy!

28:03.265 --> 28:05.267
(ominous music playing)

28:12.107 --> 28:13.358
HENRICK: Amy!

28:14.693 --> 28:15.694
HANNAH: Amy!

28:21.742 --> 28:24.161
(car engine revs)

28:26.496 --> 28:28.081
- Amy!
- Amy!

28:33.128 --> 28:35.547
What if she fell in the water?
She can't swim.

28:42.221 --> 28:43.513
Amy!

28:44.473 --> 28:47.851
Amy, you can come out now!
You're not gonna get in trouble!

28:52.773 --> 28:53.899
HENRIK: Amy!

28:57.027 --> 28:58.111
Amy!

28:58.111 --> 29:00.197
(crickets creaking)

29:01.907 --> 29:04.117
(humming)

29:25.931 --> 29:26.890
(humming stops)

29:36.066 --> 29:38.068
(classical music playing)

29:54.793 --> 29:56.795
(classical music continues playing)

29:58.505 --> 29:59.506
(clanks)

30:32.664 --> 30:34.958
(whirring)

30:41.173 --> 30:43.592
AMY: I am the chosen one.
The light shines on me.

30:46.011 --> 30:48.472
I am the chosen one.
The light shines on me.

30:49.556 --> 30:52.017
I am the chosen one.
The light shines on me.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.228
I am the chosen one.
The light shines on me.

30:55.228 --> 30:56.772
I am the chosen...

30:58.857 --> 31:00.859
(suspenseful music playing)

31:01.526 --> 31:04.154
(Amy panting)

31:17.542 --> 31:19.544
(rustling)

31:20.921 --> 31:22.923
- DEREK: Oi, get away from the bins!
- (gasps)

31:29.638 --> 31:31.848
You're one of those kids
from down round the lake.

31:35.811 --> 31:36.770
Come on.

31:38.814 --> 31:40.023
I got food.

31:40.941 --> 31:42.943
(ominous music playing)

31:53.745 --> 31:55.622
(door creaks close)

31:55.622 --> 31:57.165
(line ringing)

31:57.791 --> 32:01.253
- Hello?
- FREYA: Hey. Sorry, I know it's late.

32:01.253 --> 32:02.421
Everything okay?

32:02.754 --> 32:04.381
I know who's driving the white van.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.093
Freya, not this again.

32:08.093 --> 32:09.219
It's Max.

32:10.387 --> 32:11.346
Your Max?

32:13.557 --> 32:14.516
Yeah.

32:15.642 --> 32:16.768
You've spoken to her?

32:17.227 --> 32:18.270
How can I?

32:18.937 --> 32:20.647
After what I did, what would I say?

32:21.606 --> 32:24.192
She's come looking for you.

32:24.901 --> 32:26.027
Means she's ready.

32:32.033 --> 32:34.077
Joe, if Henrik wanted to collect
on his debt,

32:34.077 --> 32:36.329
you reckon they'd sell one
of their properties to pay him out?

32:36.329 --> 32:39.499
Freya, you mustn't worry about Henrik.

32:41.334 --> 32:43.211
It's because of me he was put away.

32:45.922 --> 32:47.382
He's an old man now.

32:49.759 --> 32:51.178
It was a long time ago.

32:53.096 --> 32:54.723
All right, night, Joe.

32:56.349 --> 32:57.267
Night.

32:58.268 --> 32:59.478
(cell phone beeps)

32:59.478 --> 33:01.563
(sombre music playing)

33:41.978 --> 33:43.146
How old are you, love?

33:48.193 --> 33:49.653
You're lucky to find me.

33:51.071 --> 33:52.989
There's no one else around here for miles.

33:54.658 --> 33:55.867
(knocking)

34:02.165 --> 34:03.500
Just sit tight, love.

34:05.502 --> 34:07.629
(door creaks open)

34:08.213 --> 34:09.965
DEREK: Yeah, gidday, I found this kid.

34:10.715 --> 34:13.760
Yeah, I think down by the lake.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.679
- POLICE: Can we come in? Yeah? Okay.
- DEREK: Yeah, come in.

34:16.304 --> 34:17.430
Blue Devils.

34:18.807 --> 34:20.433
POLICE: Easy now, okay?

34:20.433 --> 34:23.186
No one wants to hurt you, okay?

34:27.566 --> 34:28.858
(Amy pants)

34:30.694 --> 34:32.070
POLICE: Come back here!

34:32.821 --> 34:34.948
We want to help you!

34:34.948 --> 34:37.576
(panting continues)

34:42.914 --> 34:44.124
(grunts)

34:46.585 --> 34:47.919
(key clanking)

34:53.425 --> 34:55.427
(video tape whirs)

35:20.660 --> 35:21.870
(soft grunt)

35:35.967 --> 35:39.929
ADRIENNE:
You are my Kindred, the chosen ones,

35:39.929 --> 35:42.807
sent forth on a path to perfection.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.060
Take my hands.

35:46.811 --> 35:48.104
What time is it?

35:49.856 --> 35:52.609
Um... It's well after 9:00.

35:53.568 --> 35:54.819
Mo should be here.

35:54.819 --> 35:57.572
Oh, no, he said he'd be a little late.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.825
He's buying me another jigsaw puzzle.

36:01.409 --> 36:03.036
Three thousand pieces.

36:03.578 --> 36:04.871
Kill me now.

36:07.248 --> 36:08.541
Why were you watching this?

36:09.250 --> 36:13.338
Oh, just a little trip down memory lane.

36:17.425 --> 36:18.968
Go on, help your mother up.

36:23.473 --> 36:24.766
Ooh.

36:26.059 --> 36:27.102
I saw Wayne.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.979
He says that Max has been looking for me.

36:30.814 --> 36:34.317
Oh, mothers and daughters.

36:35.443 --> 36:37.529
Nothing can come between them.

36:41.866 --> 36:43.535
Don't you worry about the house.

36:44.202 --> 36:47.455
We'll find something just right
for you and Billy.

36:51.251 --> 36:53.169
(door creaks)

36:57.549 --> 36:58.550
JOE: Amy.

36:59.718 --> 37:00.719
Amy.

37:02.637 --> 37:04.139
There she is.

37:05.014 --> 37:06.057
Welcome back.

37:07.016 --> 37:08.184
My name is Joe.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.354
How's the head, Amy?

37:13.440 --> 37:14.566
That was quite a bump.

37:14.816 --> 37:16.276
How do you know my name?

37:17.944 --> 37:18.903
I took a chance.

37:19.863 --> 37:20.864
Is this your diary?

37:22.532 --> 37:23.908
Are you a Blue Devil?

37:26.369 --> 37:28.288
Well, I tend to wear grey.

37:28.997 --> 37:30.999
It's like my personality, my wife says.

37:34.669 --> 37:38.131
"Henrik took the van
to collect our new sister

37:38.131 --> 37:40.258
and bring her home to us today."

37:42.427 --> 37:43.595
Did you write that, Amy?

37:46.806 --> 37:51.478
And your new sister is Asha.

37:52.061 --> 37:53.146
Is that right?

37:55.398 --> 37:59.068
Did Asha ever mention having
any other name?

38:01.279 --> 38:02.447
(knocking)

38:04.032 --> 38:04.991
You ready?

38:06.451 --> 38:08.995
This is my colleague, Colin.

38:10.789 --> 38:11.790
Get some sleep.

38:12.957 --> 38:13.958
JOE: I'll be back.

38:13.958 --> 38:16.044
(machine beeping)

38:30.225 --> 38:31.226
Mom!

38:33.061 --> 38:34.479
BILLY: What are you doing here?

38:35.313 --> 38:36.523
MAX: Hey, Billy.

38:40.568 --> 38:42.570
(birds chirping)

38:48.201 --> 38:49.244
Hey.

38:52.747 --> 38:53.998
(sighs)

38:56.376 --> 38:58.586
(sombre music playing)

39:07.428 --> 39:08.930
When was the last time you ate?

39:16.020 --> 39:17.188
It's good to see you.

39:23.820 --> 39:24.988
I'll get you another one.

39:27.949 --> 39:31.536
- BILLY: Can I show you my pictures?
- Yeah.

39:31.536 --> 39:34.789
This is Octopus Man,
and he only has seven arms.

39:35.248 --> 39:36.499
What happened to his other one?

39:36.958 --> 39:39.085
- It fell off in a fight.
- (slurps)

39:39.627 --> 39:40.670
Cool.

39:43.006 --> 39:44.507
MAX: What about him? What does he do?

39:45.758 --> 39:48.052
BILLY: This is Tricerasnake.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.470
- MAX: Hm.
- BILLY: He does this.

39:50.847 --> 39:51.806
And this.

39:52.849 --> 39:53.933
MAX: Can I touch him?

39:54.934 --> 39:55.852
BILLY: Mm-mm.

39:56.477 --> 39:57.520
MAX: Where'd you get him?

39:58.438 --> 39:59.314
BILLY: At a store.

40:02.066 --> 40:03.318
MAX: Nice dinosaurs, hey.

40:05.904 --> 40:06.905
What does he do?

40:20.460 --> 40:23.421
(melancholic music)

40:26.049 --> 40:28.134
MAX: You never put the return address
on any of them.

40:32.764 --> 40:34.307
So how did you find me?

40:38.603 --> 40:43.107
You know, Dad told me that you left me
because you didn't know how to be a mom.

40:45.735 --> 40:47.195
I've been watching you. You...

40:49.364 --> 40:50.949
You know how to be a mom.

40:55.828 --> 40:58.373
So why did you leave me?

41:05.672 --> 41:07.382
I just wanted you to be safe.

41:08.591 --> 41:09.592
From you?

41:21.854 --> 41:23.189
(brakes creaks)

41:34.492 --> 41:36.077
Max? Bub, come here.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.205
I've been going out of my mind.

41:40.707 --> 41:41.958
- You okay?
- Yeah.

41:45.253 --> 41:46.421
Is that her dad?

41:48.923 --> 41:50.883
Billy, I told you to wait inside.

41:55.513 --> 41:56.848
You wanna introduce us?

41:58.641 --> 42:00.101
No. Not now.

42:00.101 --> 42:01.894
Freya, he needs to know who his father is.

42:01.894 --> 42:03.062
FREYA: I'm not ready.

42:04.439 --> 42:05.857
You kept him from me.

42:05.857 --> 42:07.608
Whether you're ready or not is irrelevant.

42:08.317 --> 42:10.611
You don't get to come to my house
and threaten me, Wayne.

42:11.738 --> 42:13.364
I missed eight years.

42:14.991 --> 42:16.576
I missed more than that.

42:28.713 --> 42:30.131
WAYNE: Come on, let's go.

42:31.007 --> 42:33.092
- Where's the van?
- MAX: Cops took it.

42:45.354 --> 42:47.565
(suspenseful music playing)

42:54.322 --> 42:56.741
(indistinct radio chatter)

43:24.769 --> 43:27.396
(kids indistinct shouting)

43:30.066 --> 43:31.067
(car door closes)

43:32.151 --> 43:34.362
(kids clamouring)

43:35.988 --> 43:37.365
- No! No!
- Let him go!

43:38.783 --> 43:40.326
GIRL: Mommy, where are you?

43:43.496 --> 43:45.206
- GIRL: Mommy!
- POLICE 1: Come on, let's go.

43:45.998 --> 43:47.917
POLICE 2: It's okay.
You're gonna be all right.

43:49.669 --> 43:51.379
- BOY 1: Get off me!
- BOY 2: No!

43:53.548 --> 43:55.758
(kids shouting)

44:02.390 --> 44:04.600
(sombre music playing)

44:19.866 --> 44:22.076
(indistinct chatter)

44:27.373 --> 44:28.374
How many you got?

44:29.041 --> 44:30.084
Nine.

44:30.710 --> 44:31.669
Yeah.

44:32.587 --> 44:33.504
One short.

44:38.259 --> 44:39.218
I'll check the shed.

44:39.218 --> 44:40.303
(car door closes)

44:49.187 --> 44:51.397
(suspenseful music playing)

45:21.052 --> 45:22.678
(breathes heavily)

45:34.774 --> 45:36.192
(creaks)

45:36.817 --> 45:37.777
Sara!

45:38.444 --> 45:39.487
Sara!

45:47.078 --> 45:48.829
- (crickets creaking)
- (sighs deeply)

45:50.081 --> 45:51.374
Adrienne must have her.

45:57.713 --> 45:58.673
Where is she?

46:01.592 --> 46:02.927
Where's Adrienne?

46:05.513 --> 46:06.597
Where is she?

46:08.683 --> 46:10.685
(sombre music playing)

46:15.648 --> 46:17.858
(gentle music playing)

46:18.442 --> 46:19.360
(PA system chimes)

46:19.360 --> 46:23.406
(indistinct PA announcement)

46:23.406 --> 46:26.158
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Please proceed to Gate 14 immediately.

46:35.167 --> 46:37.378
(gentle music continues playing)

46:44.468 --> 46:46.679
(panting)

46:54.603 --> 46:57.023
(gentle music playing on radio)

47:01.235 --> 47:02.403
(keys jingle)

47:04.113 --> 47:04.947
(music stops)

47:07.658 --> 47:10.870
(dog barking in distance)

47:16.375 --> 47:18.336
(foreboding music)

47:25.468 --> 47:27.470
(doorbell rings)

47:40.733 --> 47:42.068
Anton.

47:44.653 --> 47:45.696
Hello, Mommy.

47:51.452 --> 47:53.454
(closing theme music playing)
