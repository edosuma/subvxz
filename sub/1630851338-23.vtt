WEBVTT

00:02.737 --> 00:04.502
(mysterious music)

00:45.679 --> 00:48.547
- Oh! How lovely!

00:48.549 --> 00:50.816
- Another gift
for susannah, ma'am?

00:50.885 --> 00:53.485
- Yes. This one is from
my sister, ruby.

00:53.521 --> 00:56.421
- So many gifts. We'll have
to stop accepting them soon.

00:56.424 --> 00:57.623
- William.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.358
- My mother always says
that a gift is a way

00:59.360 --> 01:01.359
For a loved one
to be with you from afar.

01:01.429 --> 01:04.696
- Oh, how fitting.
It plays oh! Susannah.

01:04.832 --> 01:06.030
(chuckling)

01:06.834 --> 01:08.834
- Postcard from dr. Emily grace.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.302
She says congratulations
on the baby.

01:10.437 --> 01:14.173
- How thoughtful. She says
we should expect a surprise.

01:14.175 --> 01:16.708
- What kind of surprise?
- She doesn't say.

01:17.911 --> 01:21.113
- Is she aware that george
is to be married soon?

01:21.248 --> 01:23.115
- I think I may have
mentioned it, yes.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.983
- Ah, right.

01:24.985 --> 01:26.952
Well, I'd best be off.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.787
- Say goodbye to daddy.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.055
(baby babbling)

01:30.190 --> 01:31.222
(chuckling)

01:36.097 --> 01:37.095
- Lovely.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.534
(indistinct chattering)

01:42.669 --> 01:46.205
- Oh, the seamstress mentioned
that my dress is finished,

01:46.340 --> 01:49.207
But I can see you are wholly
not interested in that.

01:50.010 --> 01:52.678
- Oh, eh, I apologize, effie.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.881
I'm still struggling with who
to ask to be my best man

01:56.016 --> 01:58.016
For the wedding,
detective murdoch, or henry.

01:58.085 --> 02:00.118
- Will henry even
be back in time?

02:00.154 --> 02:03.288
Ruth was going on and on about
that kellogg health retreat

02:03.290 --> 02:04.823
They're attending in michigan.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.358
She threatened never to leave.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.160
- Mm. Well, in any case,

02:08.295 --> 02:10.094
I'm looking forward to finally
meeting your parents.

02:10.131 --> 02:12.030
- Hm, yes.

02:12.166 --> 02:13.632
I suppose that
has to happen, doesn't it?

02:13.767 --> 02:15.634
- Effie, it'll be just fine.
Parents adore me.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.302
And I'm sure wexford
is beautiful.

02:17.338 --> 02:20.505
- That would hardly be my first
choice of descriptor.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.373
We do have the wexford wonder,
though.

02:22.409 --> 02:25.043
- What's that?
- Just a local legend.

02:25.112 --> 02:26.912
- Well, you can't bring it up
and not tell me.

02:27.982 --> 02:30.515
- When I was a girl,
strange occurrences

02:30.584 --> 02:32.718
Started happening in the woods
near our house.

02:32.853 --> 02:35.053
- Occurrences?
- Blinding lights,

02:35.189 --> 02:38.556
Eerie sounds,
unexplained phenomena.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.459
- Did you ever
find out what it was?

02:40.461 --> 02:42.527
- We called it
the wexford wonder,

02:42.530 --> 02:45.463
But what it was
is still a matter of debate.

02:45.499 --> 02:48.466
My father believes
it's evidence of creatures
from another planet.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.801
- Aliens?

02:49.870 --> 02:52.304
- That is what they call
creatures from another planet,

02:52.439 --> 02:53.972
Isn't it?
- Don't be smart.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.675
What on earth would they be
doing visiting wexford?

02:56.677 --> 02:58.877
I mean, nothing against wexford,

02:58.879 --> 03:01.079
But surely there are places
more stimu--

03:01.081 --> 03:02.748
- I don't know, george.
Aliens visit where...

03:03.918 --> 03:06.317
Say, isn't that the detective?

03:07.287 --> 03:09.887
- Morning, sir. Sir?

03:10.891 --> 03:13.292
(gunshot)
what the devil was that?

03:13.427 --> 03:14.660
- I think it was a gunshot.

03:14.795 --> 03:15.961
(screaming)

03:15.963 --> 03:17.028
(woman 1): Is he all right?

03:17.097 --> 03:18.196
(woman 2): What happened?!

03:20.634 --> 03:21.833
- Good lord!

03:26.574 --> 03:28.173
Are you all right?

03:28.308 --> 03:30.575
- Good god. Is he...
- Effie, stay back.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.978
(grunting)

03:34.982 --> 03:38.316
Oh, thank god. It's not him.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.922
- What have you, george?

03:43.924 --> 03:45.257
- Sir, you.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.759
Or at least
a reasonable facsimile.

03:47.795 --> 03:50.262
I nearly died when I saw him
on the ground there, sir.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.530
I thought you were...

03:51.665 --> 03:55.867
- Same homburg hat,
coat, suit...

03:56.837 --> 03:58.336
Bicycle.

03:59.473 --> 04:00.872
Do you have the victim's
identification, george?

04:00.941 --> 04:02.607
- Sir, he didn't have
anything on him.

04:03.543 --> 04:04.943
What do you
suppose it means?

04:06.480 --> 04:08.313
- I have absolutely no idea.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.888
- Coincidence?

04:17.992 --> 04:20.492
- His suit was from
the tailor I employ.

04:20.494 --> 04:23.362
- Your wardrobe is
the envy of many, sir.

04:23.364 --> 04:26.832
- He was shot in the chest.
Hardly feels like a compliment.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.701
- You think someone was after
you, but killed him by mistake?

04:31.905 --> 04:35.440
- I certainly hope not,
but it's possible.

04:35.476 --> 04:39.577
- Sirs, I hate to leave during
such a puzzling case,

04:39.613 --> 04:41.513
But I do have to catch
a train to wexford.

04:41.582 --> 04:44.916
- Ah, yes. Meeting the in-laws
for the first time.

04:44.985 --> 04:47.919
Are you nervous?
- Not particularly. Should I be?

04:47.921 --> 04:50.055
- When I met my in-laws, I said,

04:50.190 --> 04:52.324
"the casserole could use
a pinch of salt."

04:52.326 --> 04:53.792
They never let me forget that.

04:53.861 --> 04:56.194
Remind me every bloody
christmas. But it did.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.997
- You'll do fine. You look nice.

05:00.034 --> 05:01.300
- Thank you, sir.

05:01.435 --> 05:02.768
- Crabtree, have you
seen today's news?

05:03.771 --> 05:05.137
- What news?

05:05.139 --> 05:07.405
- Coppers in niagara
have found edna garrison,

05:07.441 --> 05:09.074
Your previous bride-to-be.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.342
- Good lord.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.945
- The crown has decided
not to charge her or her son

05:13.981 --> 05:15.246
For her husband's murder.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.216
- Well, that's good news.

05:18.352 --> 05:19.985
- Perhaps you can invite
her to the wedding?

05:20.120 --> 05:21.320
(chuckling)
- sir...

05:21.455 --> 05:23.054
- That was a joke, murdoch.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.556
Go on, crabtree. Get off
with ya. Good luck.

05:25.592 --> 05:26.825
- Sirs.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.295
- Dodged a bullet there,
murdoch.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.697
That edna garrison;
dull as dishwater.

05:32.766 --> 05:35.867
- Well, she was the spokesperson
for white bread.

05:36.537 --> 05:37.569
- Is that a joke?

05:39.239 --> 05:40.839
(indistinct chattering)

05:43.744 --> 05:45.777
- 7.65 millimetres.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.913
- So, a rifle.
- Indeed.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.981
The bullet travelled
in a downward trajectory,

05:50.017 --> 05:52.617
Penetrating the man's chest
and killing him instantly.

05:52.753 --> 05:55.520
- Were you able to find any
other distinguishing features?

05:55.522 --> 05:58.322
Scars? Birthmarks?
- Nothing.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.925
I did take the liberty
of contacting the tailor.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.795
It seems this gentleman came
in with a list of exactly

06:03.831 --> 06:05.530
What he wanted and paid in cash.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.466
Other than that,
he knew nothing about him.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.667
(door opening and closing)

06:09.669 --> 06:10.802
- Thank you. Let us know

06:10.871 --> 06:13.004
If you find anything else
of interest, mrs. Hart.

06:13.006 --> 06:14.139
- Thank you.

06:17.177 --> 06:18.143
- Gentlemen.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.946
Hello, violet.
- Maurice.

06:22.682 --> 06:24.416
What a pleasant surprise.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.487
I will have my final report
submitted in the next hour.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.422
- Of course.
Thank you, mrs. Hart.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.360
- What are you doing here?

06:36.964 --> 06:38.029
- Now, now.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.565
I thought I taught you
better manners than that.

06:40.634 --> 06:44.102
- The only thing you ever taught
me was to keep my distance.

06:45.272 --> 06:48.306
- Well, that's about to change.

06:48.308 --> 06:50.108
I'm a reformed man, my dear,

06:50.110 --> 06:52.844
And if you'll let me,
I'll prove it.

06:54.314 --> 06:56.247
Now come give your father a hug.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.721
(mysterious music)

07:03.757 --> 07:06.057
(indistinct chattering)

07:06.894 --> 07:09.160
- So, the body was found here?

07:10.130 --> 07:11.062
- Yes.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.799
And given that
he was in motion,

07:14.868 --> 07:17.202
And the downward trajectory
of the bullet,

07:17.337 --> 07:20.672
I'd estimate the shot came
from at least the second floor.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.207
- That building there?

07:29.216 --> 07:31.483
(knocking)
- police.

07:40.194 --> 07:41.359
Clear shot.

07:42.963 --> 07:46.597
- Looks like a match
to the bullet retrieved
from the victim's body.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.169
- Look at these.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.707
- The gouges look recent.

07:55.842 --> 07:57.509
- They certainly do.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.512
Let's have a constable take
proper photographs of these.

08:00.514 --> 08:01.445
- Of course.

08:07.754 --> 08:11.323
- Ah, mrs. Newsome, it's
a pleasure to finally meet you.

08:11.325 --> 08:13.057
- Charmed.
- Effie, my dear,

08:13.093 --> 08:14.726
You are glowing.
- Ooh!

08:14.795 --> 08:15.927
(laughing)

08:15.963 --> 08:18.663
- George, this is my father,
peregrine newsome.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.665
- George crabtree.
It's a pleasure, sir.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.801
- Call me perry.
And the pleasure is all mine.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.869
I look forward to meeting
your folks one day, as well.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.204
- And I hope you will.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.807
My father is hoping to attend
the wedding. Fingers crossed.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.508
- What about mrs. Crabtree?

08:30.511 --> 08:32.744
- Actually, my parents
were never married.

08:32.746 --> 08:35.413
- There she is! The bride-to-be!

08:35.549 --> 08:38.550
- Oh! Oh, millie!

08:38.685 --> 08:40.819
George, this is my best friend

08:40.821 --> 08:43.021
In the entire world,
millie montgomery.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.956
- A pleasure.
- It's nice to meet you,

08:44.992 --> 08:48.226
You lucky, lucky man. He's cute!

08:48.228 --> 08:51.829
- I understand you're to be
effie's maid of honour.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.899
- And an honour
it will truly be.

08:54.902 --> 08:57.635
But now, I'm off again.
I'm catching a train

08:57.771 --> 08:59.170
To uxbridge this afternoon.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.239
I just wanted to come by
and say hello.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.408
- No! What? This afternoon?
Whatever for?

09:05.312 --> 09:07.579
- It's a surprise.
But don't worry,

09:07.648 --> 09:09.314
I'll be back in plenty of time
for the wedding.

09:09.316 --> 09:11.115
- Well, you must let george
and I accompany you

09:11.184 --> 09:12.517
To the train station.

09:12.586 --> 09:16.187
- That would be lovely.
Meet me at my house at three.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.726
- Ah, may I help you with that?
- You may not.

09:25.932 --> 09:28.533
- So, I admit, I've not spent
much time in wexford,

09:28.668 --> 09:31.469
But I do hear
it's full of wonders.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.205
- Wexford? How so?

09:35.475 --> 09:38.142
- Well, specifically,
the-the-the wexford wonder.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.144
The--
- you know of it?

09:40.180 --> 09:43.147
- Just what effie's told me,
but I find it fascinating.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.683
I have my own theory
about aliens, you know,

09:45.819 --> 09:47.018
Specifically, venusians.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.220
- We don't talk nonsense
in this house.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.356
Isn't that right, peregrine?

09:51.425 --> 09:54.092
- Y-yes, dear. Quite right.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.365
- Mrs. Hart.

10:00.367 --> 10:03.167
- Inspector.
What can I do for you?

10:03.203 --> 10:05.236
- The man who was visiting you
this morning.

10:05.372 --> 10:06.904
He looked familiar.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.472
I'm not sure where
I know him from,

10:08.508 --> 10:10.574
But I think he might be
a... A criminal.

10:10.611 --> 10:13.244
- He is a criminal.
Reformed, as he says.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.913
He also happens to be my father.

10:15.915 --> 10:18.516
- Ah, I take it
you're not close?

10:18.518 --> 10:20.251
- We are not.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.786
- What does he want?

10:21.788 --> 10:23.388
- Absolution, I suppose.

10:23.523 --> 10:25.056
He's been absent
for my entire life,

10:25.092 --> 10:26.624
And now, he wants
to make up for it.

10:26.693 --> 10:28.192
- How are you faring with that?

10:29.229 --> 10:30.528
- I've survived this long
without a father.

10:30.564 --> 10:31.996
I certainly don't need one now.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.365
- Hm. I see. Right, then.

10:35.569 --> 10:37.268
Not that it's
any of my business,

10:37.337 --> 10:39.937
But you might not want
to write him off completely.

10:39.939 --> 10:42.206
Sometimes, parents deserve
a second chance.

10:47.814 --> 10:51.082
(door opening and closing)

10:51.885 --> 10:53.418
(knocking)

10:53.553 --> 10:55.153
- Your mother didn't take to me

10:55.155 --> 10:56.988
As enthusiastically
as I'd hoped.

10:57.123 --> 10:59.156
But your father seems
an affable sort.

10:59.192 --> 11:02.227
- Millie's not answering.
- Maybe she's already left.

11:02.229 --> 11:05.096
- Why would she tell us to meet
her here if she's already left?

11:05.098 --> 11:07.298
- Well, I don't know.
She's your friend.

11:08.568 --> 11:09.901
- George, look.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.304
- Oh, my goodness.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.372
- What on earth could
have made those?

11:16.643 --> 11:20.244
- Effie, I don't think anything
from earth made these.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.313
- So...

11:23.517 --> 11:25.316
- So, I think your friend
may have had an encounter

11:25.318 --> 11:26.718
With the wexford wonder!

11:35.128 --> 11:37.662
- This casing is a match for the
bullet that killed the victim.

11:37.797 --> 11:39.531
We've checked
the fingermarks on it,

11:39.666 --> 11:41.800
But they don't match anyone
we have on record.

11:41.802 --> 11:42.867
- Witnesses?

11:42.869 --> 11:45.035
- We've scoured
the neighbourhood. Nothing.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.940
- If he was set up
in that window,

11:48.942 --> 11:51.276
The shooter would have known
that the rider

11:51.411 --> 11:54.178
Would go down that street
at that time.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.514
It's a route I take often.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.182
- All to send you a message?

11:58.985 --> 12:00.952
- A veiled one at that.

12:00.954 --> 12:04.088
- Or it could have been
completely coincidental.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.357
The only reason we think
this may be a message

12:06.359 --> 12:08.093
Is the victim was dressed
like you?

12:09.896 --> 12:12.029
- What are the odds
that the man would be wearing
murdoch's exact outfit?

12:12.065 --> 12:15.233
- In the random chaos
of hundreds of thousands

12:15.235 --> 12:19.036
Of sartorial decisions
made each morning in this city,

12:19.072 --> 12:22.640
It's inevitable two men
may make the same...

12:22.709 --> 12:25.777
Uninspired decision
on the same day.

12:25.846 --> 12:29.047
- How many of those men
would have been shot
by a bloody sniper?

12:29.049 --> 12:31.048
We've been down this road
before, watts:

12:31.084 --> 12:32.717
If it seems like someone's
after murdoch,

12:32.786 --> 12:34.418
Someone's after murdoch.
- All right.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.254
- What's this?

12:37.591 --> 12:40.725
- I believe they're the marks
left behind by a gunrest.

12:40.860 --> 12:43.327
- So, a professional job.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.597
- We've taken measurements
hoping to compare it

12:46.633 --> 12:47.932
To a make and model.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.600
- I'll get right on it.

12:50.804 --> 12:53.337
- Father, you won't believe
this but millie's been--

12:53.406 --> 12:55.039
(laughing)
roderick?

12:55.041 --> 12:58.209
- Oh, hello, fiona.
- What are you doing here?

12:58.245 --> 13:02.413
- Roderick frequently drops by.
He's such delightful company.

13:02.549 --> 13:03.681
(chuckling)

13:03.683 --> 13:05.683
I do think you and he should try
to patch up things.

13:05.819 --> 13:09.486
- Now, the better man won,
mrs. Newsome.

13:09.523 --> 13:13.157
Congratulations on
your impending nuptials,
mr. Crabtree.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.227
I should have never let her
get away from me.

13:16.263 --> 13:19.163
- You never let me do anything.
- What is this about millie?

13:19.166 --> 13:21.699
- She seems to have disappeared.
- We went around to collect her,

13:21.701 --> 13:23.167
But she was nowhere
to be found.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.936
And then, outside the house
were these strange footprints.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.505
- Strange footprints?

13:30.176 --> 13:31.976
- Unlike anything
I've ever seen before.

13:33.013 --> 13:35.179
- Four-toed? Like those
of a giant frog?

13:35.215 --> 13:36.280
- Yes!

13:37.116 --> 13:38.583
- I knew they'd be back.

13:38.718 --> 13:40.118
- What, creatures
from another planet?!

13:40.253 --> 13:41.853
- Oh, good lord, not this again.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.520
- The same thing happened
to billy mumphries.

13:43.557 --> 13:44.855
I saw it before my very eyes.

13:44.891 --> 13:47.859
- Peregrine, you agreed to leave
this nonsense behind.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.127
- I saw billy mumphries
walk into the woods

13:50.197 --> 13:52.330
By the marlowe settlement
the very night he disappeared.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.798
- Oh, good lord.
- Everyone in wexford knows

13:54.835 --> 13:56.935
Billy mumphries left town,
mr. Newsome.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.802
I personally saw him
get on the train.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.607
- I have something to show you.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.544
- Aren't you keeping someone
else's mother waiting?

14:10.283 --> 14:13.751
- Ten years ago, I was
conducting an experiment
on the portal,

14:13.820 --> 14:16.621
Which I believe is a passageway
to other dimensions

14:16.690 --> 14:18.555
As real as our own.

14:18.592 --> 14:21.092
Are you familiar with the
scientist albert einstein?

14:21.161 --> 14:23.962
- Familiar? George and
mr. Einstein are pen pals!

14:23.964 --> 14:26.363
- He writes me incessantly.
- He likes you.

14:26.399 --> 14:29.167
- I don't know.
Sometimes, I think he's
using me for my mind.

14:29.169 --> 14:33.304
- Regardless,
einstein's theories articulate
what I have always believed,

14:33.439 --> 14:36.441
That there are other planes
of existence beyond our own.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.576
- Like another world?
- Indeed.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.179
But a world not accessed
through space,

14:41.181 --> 14:43.781
But through a portal of sorts.

14:43.850 --> 14:47.385
A gate that crosses
time and place.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.853
- Have you seen this portal?

14:49.890 --> 14:53.858
- No. It only opens
under certain conditions.

14:53.860 --> 14:54.992
- Such as?

14:56.162 --> 14:58.997
- An alignment, an increase
in sunspot activity

14:59.132 --> 15:01.598
And a very specific part
of the lunar cycle.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.467
When the moon is at perigee--

15:03.503 --> 15:05.903
- Its closest point to earth.
- Correct.

15:07.107 --> 15:10.274
At perigee, the moon's tidal
pull reaches its peak

15:10.277 --> 15:12.476
And I believe it works
in conjunction with the sunspots

15:12.512 --> 15:14.879
To alter the earth's
magnetic field,

15:15.014 --> 15:17.181
Allowing for an opening
in the portal

15:17.183 --> 15:20.551
To a realm that is beyond
the veil of human perception.

15:20.587 --> 15:21.919
(sighing)

15:22.789 --> 15:23.888
- Tell george what happened

15:23.890 --> 15:25.522
The night billy mumphries
disappeared.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.426
- I was measuring
the magnetic flux

15:28.495 --> 15:30.461
In the woods down
by the marlowe settlement.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.897
I saw mumphries there,
but before I could say hello,

15:33.934 --> 15:36.968
There was an intense flash
of light and a sound

15:37.103 --> 15:39.170
Like the sky was tearing apart.
And in that moment...

15:39.172 --> 15:40.237
(snaps fingers)

15:40.941 --> 15:41.973
...Mumphries vanished.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.174
- Sucked into the portal.

15:44.210 --> 15:46.543
- Or dragged in
by an alien visitor.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.714
- Well, perhaps millie
is still in there.

15:49.783 --> 15:52.116
- Well, we can only hope.
- And pray.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.221
(birds chirping)

16:01.328 --> 16:02.860
- How innovative.

16:02.996 --> 16:06.263
A device that controls the
temperature in the entire home.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.933
- Thank you. And you are?

16:08.935 --> 16:12.336
- William, you're home.
This is father rockford.

16:12.405 --> 16:15.806
- Ah. Father, please come in.

16:15.842 --> 16:17.208
- Oh, thank you.

16:17.343 --> 16:19.210
I've decided to come and call

16:19.212 --> 16:22.480
On the local parishioners
to introduce myself.

16:22.482 --> 16:26.250
- I see. What's happened
to father harris?

16:26.319 --> 16:29.487
- Oh, he suffered a fall, and he
needs to rest for several weeks.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.089
- Wow. Thank you for coming.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.891
Sunday is such
a special day for us.

16:33.893 --> 16:37.161
- Yes, I've heard
there's to be a christening.

16:37.296 --> 16:39.230
- Our daughter, susannah.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.166
- Perhaps we could wait
for father harris

16:42.301 --> 16:43.967
To take the time he needs...
- Nonsense.

16:44.004 --> 16:48.239
One must never wait to welcome
a child of god into the church.

16:49.442 --> 16:52.243
- What parish did you say
you were coming from?

16:52.245 --> 16:54.912
- William, father rockford
has a lot of other calls

16:54.914 --> 16:56.247
To make today.
We shouldn't keep him.

16:56.382 --> 16:57.215
- Indeed.

16:58.051 --> 16:59.384
I'll let myself out.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.792
(door opening and closing)

17:07.861 --> 17:09.794
- I may make a call
to the parish

17:09.796 --> 17:12.263
To see what they know
about this father rockford.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.398
- William, you don't trust him?

17:16.770 --> 17:20.471
- Julia, a man was shot
and killed today.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.340
He wore a suit and hat
just like mine

17:23.410 --> 17:26.877
And rode a bicycle along
my route to the station house.

17:26.946 --> 17:30.414
I can't help but think that it
was meant as a message to me.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.683
- How curious.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.219
But a priest, william?

17:35.221 --> 17:36.954
The only people
that I can think of

17:37.023 --> 17:39.157
That would want you dead
are dead themselves.

17:39.159 --> 17:42.526
Eva pearce, ralph fellows,
james gillies.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.495
- Well, I can think of...

17:46.800 --> 17:49.300
I'll be back shortly.
Lock the door.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.535
- William, we never
lock the door.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.036
- We do now.

17:57.143 --> 17:59.309
- This is one of the first
places I took violet.

17:59.345 --> 18:01.846
- Oh, something sure to sweep
any girl off her feet.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.314
- Oh, please.

18:03.449 --> 18:06.517
- I thought the same.
So, I bought it for her.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.252
- You bought it?
- That I did.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.554
- On a whim?

18:09.689 --> 18:12.422
- Nothing whimsical about
courting miss violet hart,

18:12.459 --> 18:14.057
I can assure you of that.
(chuckling)

18:15.061 --> 18:16.793
- You must do well,
mr. Carmichael.

18:16.830 --> 18:17.995
- I'm comfortable.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.864
And getting even more so
with your daughter

18:19.866 --> 18:21.332
In charge of our finances.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.734
She is something
of a miracle worker.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.671
- Is that so?
- That's quite enough, arthur.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.005
No need for all that.

18:28.007 --> 18:29.807
- She hates it
when I talk about money.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.475
(laughing)

18:31.544 --> 18:33.945
- Pardon me, I must go
find the powder room.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.679
(indistinct background chatter)

18:37.416 --> 18:40.351
- So, how long are you planning
on staying in toronto?

18:40.353 --> 18:42.954
- I, uh... I'd never want
to impose,

18:43.089 --> 18:46.757
But my itinerary
has been interrupted
by a lack of funds.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.325
Perhaps, with a little help...

18:48.394 --> 18:50.628
- Will a $1,000 be enough
to be rid of you?

18:50.763 --> 18:53.564
- Darling, how generous of you.

18:53.566 --> 18:56.033
- All right. Consider it done.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.302
(metal gate squeaking)

18:59.172 --> 19:00.638
- Good afternoon, mr. Rhodes.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.106
- Detective.

19:03.576 --> 19:06.977
I assume you're here to
apologize before they hang me.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.046
- I'm not.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.783
What can you tell me
about this man?

19:14.020 --> 19:16.120
- Looks like a man who got
what was coming to him.

19:17.623 --> 19:20.858
- So, you know him.
- Might. Might not.

19:21.460 --> 19:22.859
(tense music)

19:23.997 --> 19:26.197
- He was shot and killed
in the street

19:26.266 --> 19:30.401
And dressed to look like
a copy of me. Same hat, suit.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.436
- No accounting for taste.

19:33.806 --> 19:36.407
So, what, you think
I sent someone to kill you,

19:36.476 --> 19:38.409
But they got him instead?

19:40.346 --> 19:42.680
- I believe he was killed
as a message.

19:43.917 --> 19:46.650
- Well, don't you have
a high opinion of yourself?

19:47.820 --> 19:49.286
Why would I do that?

19:50.423 --> 19:52.022
- To torment me.

19:53.426 --> 19:58.528
To lure me here to see you one
last time before you kill me.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.034
- I'm hardly
that interested in you.

20:03.036 --> 20:04.501
(grunting)

20:04.503 --> 20:08.305
I am simply biding my time
before I meet my maker.

20:10.109 --> 20:12.576
- So, you hold
no ill will against me?

20:14.080 --> 20:17.381
- I've come to realize that
I deserve my punishment.

20:20.186 --> 20:22.319
All men get
what they deserve.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.790
- I deserve nothing
for lying to you?

20:26.859 --> 20:27.924
- You tell me.

20:29.595 --> 20:31.929
Do you have a guilty conscience?

20:33.800 --> 20:35.399
- Goodbye, mr. Rhodes.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.737
(whistling "oh! Susannah")

20:47.413 --> 20:49.212
Aughing)

20:49.249 --> 20:52.149
- Well, despite being unable to
find susannah's favourite doll,

20:52.218 --> 20:53.684
I've managed to get her
to sleep...

20:55.188 --> 20:57.488
Georges! What a surprise!

20:57.557 --> 20:59.156
- A happy one, I hope.

20:59.158 --> 21:02.426
- Yes, yes, of course.
I see you've met julia.

21:02.462 --> 21:05.029
- In fact, he's been charming me
for the last half an hour.

21:05.031 --> 21:08.231
- No doubt.
What brings you here?

21:08.268 --> 21:10.967
- Police business. I'm looking
for a man who's gone missing.

21:11.004 --> 21:12.770
We believe he is in toronto.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.371
But I heard you had a daughter,

21:14.407 --> 21:16.907
So I had to come and offer
my congratulations.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.709
- Thank you. Thank you.

21:18.745 --> 21:21.245
But I'm afraid you've come
at a very busy time.

21:21.247 --> 21:23.580
- Susannah is due
to be baptized.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.783
- Ah, that's wonderful.
(chuckling)

21:25.852 --> 21:28.652
- Well, actually,
would you like to attend?

21:28.721 --> 21:30.388
We don't have a lot
of family here.

21:30.390 --> 21:33.123
- I would be honoured.
Detective?

21:34.193 --> 21:36.794
- Yes, of course.
It would be our honour.

21:36.863 --> 21:40.130
- Thank you.
I will be off.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.133
Doctor.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.873
(door opening)
- is everything all right?

21:50.476 --> 21:51.508
(door closing)

21:53.412 --> 21:56.546
- Julia, when I was
at the don jail,

21:57.616 --> 22:00.484
Frank rhodes was whistling
oh! Susannah.

22:00.619 --> 22:02.953
- Yes, william, you told me.

22:03.089 --> 22:05.089
I don't think there's
anything to worry about.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.957
It's a very
popular song nowadays.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.092
I hear it everywhere.

22:08.795 --> 22:10.294
(tense music)

22:11.964 --> 22:14.631
- Have you, by chance,
touched anything on my desk?

22:14.701 --> 22:15.633
- No.

22:16.769 --> 22:17.701
I haven't been anywhere
near your desk.

22:17.737 --> 22:20.571
I know how particular
you are. Why?

22:21.407 --> 22:22.806
- My keys have been moved.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.509
I always leave my keys

22:25.511 --> 22:27.378
Horizontally on the left side
of this desk.

22:27.513 --> 22:30.380
They are now
in a pile on the right.

22:31.451 --> 22:33.517
- Well, no one else
has been in the house.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.720
- Father rockford, the nanny.

22:36.789 --> 22:39.189
- Both very trustworthy people.

22:39.258 --> 22:41.392
In fact, I called
about father rockford.

22:41.461 --> 22:43.594
He is filling in
for father harris.

22:43.663 --> 22:46.130
You may need to consider
that the dead man

22:46.199 --> 22:49.333
Wearing your suit was...
Was just a coincidence.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.404
(indistinct chattering)

22:56.776 --> 22:59.810
- I've been able to ascertain
that the divots

22:59.879 --> 23:02.413
Left by the sniper
on the windowsill were made

23:02.415 --> 23:04.981
By a german army
issue mauser gunrest.

23:06.319 --> 23:09.353
- Canvas all the gun stores,
see if anyone bought one lately.

23:09.355 --> 23:11.688
- A task already completed.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.424
- And?
- Nothing.

23:13.559 --> 23:16.694
It's possible the shooter
brought it to toronto with him.

23:19.365 --> 23:20.130
(snaps fingers)

23:21.033 --> 23:23.567
Inspector, you seem
distracted.

23:24.637 --> 23:27.371
- I met this chap.
Mrs. Hart's father.

23:27.373 --> 23:29.373
- Oh.
- I seem to think I've met him

23:29.508 --> 23:31.242
Somewhere before,
but I can't remember where.

23:31.377 --> 23:34.712
- Do you recall it being
a pleasant encounter?

23:34.847 --> 23:36.213
- I don't think so.

23:38.551 --> 23:40.651
(high-pitched radio frequency)

23:40.720 --> 23:42.253
- This is more complicated

23:42.255 --> 23:43.987
Than one of the detective's
contraptions.

23:44.023 --> 23:47.191
- Well, my father
is a strangely brilliant man.

23:48.527 --> 23:50.060
- It's definitely on,
but it's not getting a reading.

23:50.062 --> 23:52.263
There must not be much
activity right now.

23:52.398 --> 23:55.065
- Are you sure about that?
- Oh, good lord.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.701
- My father and I would--
- effie, sh-sh-sh-shh!

23:59.071 --> 24:01.605
- Do not shush me. That is not
a habit I will ever encourage.

24:01.607 --> 24:04.074
- I think I see something.
- What is it?

24:04.076 --> 24:07.611
- Some sort of hideous
creature with a thick neck

24:07.613 --> 24:10.747
And large, glassy head.
- Good lord!

24:10.783 --> 24:12.082
- I'm going to try
to get closer.

24:12.218 --> 24:13.884
- I'm coming with you.
- Effie, no.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.352
We don't know
how dangerous it could be.

24:15.488 --> 24:17.821
- Well, exactly.
That's why I'm not letting you
go over there alone.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.690
- All right, fine,
but be careful.

24:23.062 --> 24:25.229
We come in peace!

24:27.266 --> 24:30.000
Stop! Uh, freeze!

24:31.337 --> 24:33.270
(tense music)

24:34.773 --> 24:36.373
Wait! Stop.

24:36.509 --> 24:38.208
We mean you no harm.

24:39.412 --> 24:40.344
Stop right there.

24:42.114 --> 24:43.547
Toronto constabulary!

24:48.354 --> 24:49.653
What on earth?!

24:50.389 --> 24:52.188
- Let go of me!

24:52.225 --> 24:53.456
- Who are you?

24:53.493 --> 24:54.891
And what were you doing
wearing that mask?

24:54.927 --> 24:56.126
- Harriet townsend.

24:56.195 --> 24:57.594
I was welding
in my family's shed

24:57.663 --> 24:59.462
When I saw you people
lurking out here.

24:59.499 --> 25:01.265
- We weren't lurking.
- Were too.

25:01.267 --> 25:04.234
- We thought you could be the
wexford wonder, for pete's sake.

25:05.604 --> 25:07.504
- It's back?
- It may be.

25:07.639 --> 25:09.073
It may have kidnapped
a friend of ours.

25:09.075 --> 25:10.941
- Oh, no. Not again.

25:10.977 --> 25:12.209
- Again?

25:12.278 --> 25:13.877
What are you talking about?

25:15.181 --> 25:16.246
- Come with me.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.751
(mysterious music)

25:23.422 --> 25:27.558
They say billy mumphries
left town, but I know better.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.159
He was taken.

25:29.161 --> 25:31.495
- I heard he was set to be wed,
but got cold feet.

25:31.630 --> 25:33.564
- That's not true.
He loved my sister!

25:33.633 --> 25:35.098
He never would have left her.

25:35.735 --> 25:36.967
- Your sister?

25:37.036 --> 25:39.669
- What are you two doing
out here disturbing us?

25:41.173 --> 25:44.508
- We're investigating
the mysterious disappearance
of a young lady.

25:44.643 --> 25:46.710
- He thinks aliens
might be involved.

25:46.712 --> 25:48.112
Same as billy's disappearance.

25:48.114 --> 25:51.048
- Don't start with that crazy
newsome stuff again.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.516
He left and never came back

25:52.518 --> 25:54.618
On account he didn't want
to marry your sister!

25:54.620 --> 25:56.252
- He did, too, want to marry me!

25:56.289 --> 25:57.520
You drove him away!

25:57.557 --> 26:00.323
He was never good enough
for you. But he loved me!

26:04.129 --> 26:06.096
- Now you see
what you've all stirred up?

26:07.300 --> 26:08.399
You happy?

26:08.935 --> 26:09.866
Get out.

26:12.171 --> 26:13.037
Get out!

26:16.609 --> 26:18.441
- Thank you for your help, sir.
- Get!

26:22.081 --> 26:23.947
(mysterious music)

26:26.419 --> 26:27.484
(gasps)
- william!

26:29.755 --> 26:31.889
- Ah-ha! I found it.

26:32.024 --> 26:35.626
- Oh, there it is.
That's her favourite doll.

26:35.628 --> 26:37.561
It must have fallen
out of the bassinet.

26:37.696 --> 26:38.829
Perhaps she threw it!

26:38.964 --> 26:42.433
- I doubt she has the physical
capability to do that yet.

26:42.435 --> 26:45.101
It's been broken clean off.

26:45.137 --> 26:48.304
- What, so you think that
someone broke in and did it?

26:49.275 --> 26:51.308
Or it was someone we let in.

26:51.377 --> 26:52.575
(scoffing)

26:52.612 --> 26:54.545
(ragtime music)

27:01.587 --> 27:02.919
- That will be quite the show.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.588
- You're familiar with
miss bloom, inspector?

27:05.625 --> 27:08.392
- Not as well as some, but
I have made her acquaintance.

27:08.394 --> 27:10.127
- A well-travelled man.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.062
- I am indeed, miss bright.

27:12.064 --> 27:13.930
You can say I have been
around the block.

27:13.932 --> 27:15.165
- No doubt.

27:17.536 --> 27:18.735
- Ah.

27:18.804 --> 27:20.737
Well now, that's something
that'll get the heart pumping.

27:22.541 --> 27:25.476
Mind if I sit down?
- Evening, mr. Hart.

27:25.611 --> 27:28.545
- Oh, I may be violet's father,
but my last name's not hart.

27:28.614 --> 27:29.879
- Oh?

27:29.915 --> 27:31.281
- Do you remember yet?

27:31.283 --> 27:32.615
Where you know me from?

27:33.319 --> 27:34.551
- I'm afraid not.

27:35.621 --> 27:38.355
- My last name is majors.
Maurice majors.

27:38.490 --> 27:39.890
- Do I get another clue?

27:39.892 --> 27:41.224
- I'm surprised you need one.

27:42.628 --> 27:44.027
Let me buy you a drink.

27:44.964 --> 27:45.962
Excuse me, if you would be
so kind,

27:45.998 --> 27:47.431
A couple of scotches
over here.

27:52.438 --> 27:54.438
- Yes, he's usually out all day.

27:54.573 --> 27:55.906
But he's home right now.

27:55.975 --> 27:59.443
Dr. Ogden is going out tomorrow
afternoon, I know that.

27:59.512 --> 28:01.277
I have to go. Goodbye.

28:04.250 --> 28:07.050
- Were you just telling someone
when we'd be out of the house?

28:07.053 --> 28:10.587
- Well, yes, but--
- who were you speaking with?

28:10.589 --> 28:12.088
- That's private, sir.

28:14.827 --> 28:17.127
- Did you go through
my desk earlier?

28:17.262 --> 28:18.361
- Sir?

28:20.733 --> 28:23.600
- Do you know who broke
susannah's doll?

28:23.669 --> 28:25.469
- No, of course not!

28:26.439 --> 28:28.739
- Is that the truth?
- Yes, it is.

28:28.874 --> 28:32.008
You're being very unreasonable.
Good day.

28:32.010 --> 28:34.010
- What's going on?
Why are you leaving?

28:34.046 --> 28:35.546
- Your husband is being rude

28:35.681 --> 28:37.814
And prying into my private
matters and accusing me

28:37.950 --> 28:41.485
Of all sorts of misdeeds.
You can forward my pay.

28:46.325 --> 28:47.190
- William.

28:52.297 --> 28:55.098
- The readings were high,
between eight and ten.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.835
But then, I mistook
a young woman in a welding mask

28:57.837 --> 29:00.570
To be the alien,
and actually ended up
meeting her family,

29:00.639 --> 29:01.905
Who were a bit...

29:02.908 --> 29:04.742
In any case, we went back
to the same area

29:04.877 --> 29:06.309
Looking for the readings again.
Nothing.

29:06.979 --> 29:08.111
- Well, that's good.

29:08.114 --> 29:10.247
It means the portal
could still be open.

29:11.650 --> 29:13.584
Although it's surprising you
were getting such high levels.

29:14.453 --> 29:15.819
This thing could be broken.

29:17.356 --> 29:20.456
Anyway, your best chance at
finding the portal is tonight.

29:20.493 --> 29:21.658
- Tonight?

29:21.660 --> 29:22.926
- My knee's been acting up.

29:23.061 --> 29:24.728
Means a storm's coming.

29:24.730 --> 29:27.731
And tonight,
the moon reaches perigee.

29:27.866 --> 29:30.200
If you're ever going to find
that portal, now's the time.

29:30.202 --> 29:33.269
- We still have a chance
to find millie and save her.

29:33.305 --> 29:35.071
Are you up for it?
- Of course.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.541
- Oh, blast, I'm going
to miss my train.

29:37.543 --> 29:40.010
- George.
- I'll be back before nightfall.

29:40.079 --> 29:41.878
- Where are you off to?
- Toronto.

29:42.681 --> 29:44.081
- George is to be a godfather.

29:45.818 --> 29:48.418
(indistinct chattering)

29:50.523 --> 29:52.488
- How did you convince
her to stay on?

29:52.525 --> 29:56.426
- How do you think? Assurances,
apologies. And money.

29:56.428 --> 29:58.628
- A lot?
- Enough.

29:59.498 --> 30:01.632
- Uh, dr. Ogden, a moment?

30:01.767 --> 30:02.833
- Of course.

30:04.637 --> 30:06.569
- Sir, I'm sorry I'm late.

30:06.605 --> 30:08.572
- It's all right.
We haven't begun yet.

30:08.574 --> 30:10.173
- Is the inspector not here yet?

30:10.176 --> 30:12.109
- Um, he's slipped out for a...

30:12.111 --> 30:14.177
- Sir, you're not going
to believe what's happening
in wexford.

30:14.180 --> 30:16.446
This is going
to sound fantastical,

30:16.515 --> 30:19.983
But I am within a hair's breadth
of making a true,

30:19.985 --> 30:23.120
Verifiable sighting of creatures
from another planet.

30:23.255 --> 30:24.520
- Aliens?

30:25.257 --> 30:26.923
From what planet?

30:28.027 --> 30:30.426
- Well, I-I-I-I don't
yet know, but...

30:32.097 --> 30:34.798
I've always thought mars
to be a much less likely place
of origin than--

30:34.933 --> 30:36.399
(both): Venus!
- Yes.

30:36.435 --> 30:38.201
- Why, you must be
george crabtree.

30:38.270 --> 30:39.836
I have heard about you.

30:39.839 --> 30:42.606
- Yes, and I have you, mister...

30:42.741 --> 30:44.274
- Constable georges fournier.

30:44.310 --> 30:48.111
- Uh, yes. George, georges,
georges, george.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.014
If you'll excuse me a moment.

30:52.218 --> 30:54.218
- Where did you see
these aliens?

30:54.353 --> 30:58.187
- Well, I haven't seen
them yet, per se.

30:59.158 --> 31:00.690
- Is everything all right?

31:00.759 --> 31:03.159
- Oh, yes, why wouldn't it be?

31:03.229 --> 31:04.427
- Uh...

31:06.165 --> 31:08.565
(speaking latin)

31:22.748 --> 31:24.514
(all): Amen.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.183
(speaking latin hesitantly)

31:44.136 --> 31:45.969
(whispering): He doesn't know
the rites.

31:46.605 --> 31:47.904
- Perhaps he's new.

31:49.341 --> 31:51.407
- Bloody hell, this is taking
longer than the birth.

31:51.443 --> 31:52.676
- Shh!

31:52.678 --> 31:55.345
(speaking latin)

32:04.023 --> 32:05.756
- Wait, wait!
What are you doing?

32:05.891 --> 32:06.856
- The baptism.

32:09.094 --> 32:11.561
- Get away from my daughter.
I don't want you touching her.

32:11.697 --> 32:13.529
- All right. Okay.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.431
You can hold her.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.034
May I continue?

32:22.274 --> 32:23.139
- Uh...

32:25.210 --> 32:28.011
Y-yes, I'm sorry.
Please continue.

to see you too, my dear.

32:46.264 --> 32:48.731
- I thought you would have used
some of your newfound resources

32:48.767 --> 32:50.099
To resume your travels.

32:51.103 --> 32:52.869

I thought so too, but I...

32:52.871 --> 32:55.238

Seems like it might be time

33:06.551 --> 33:08.151

33:08.286 --> 33:10.020
- This isn't your home, sir.

33:10.155 --> 33:11.554
Who is this man?

33:11.590 --> 33:13.090
- My father.

33:13.092 --> 33:15.224
- Maurice majors, miss...

33:16.094 --> 33:18.661
- Get out from behind my bar.

33:19.932 --> 33:21.764
- I'll just finish
pouring my drink.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.266
- I don't think
I'm comfortable with that.

33:23.268 --> 33:24.701
- Well, I suggest
you get comfortable.

33:25.971 --> 33:27.904
- Maybe you are confused.

33:28.707 --> 33:31.041
This is my salon.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.443
- Is that so? Mm.

33:33.445 --> 33:38.147
You know, I'd love to have
a place just like this one day.

33:39.451 --> 33:41.518
Maybe this very place indeed.

33:42.254 --> 33:44.588
Ha! Let's sing.

33:44.723 --> 33:46.056
(laughing)

33:46.191 --> 33:48.191
(humming)

33:51.563 --> 33:52.829
(door closing)

33:53.465 --> 33:55.865
- Hello? Julia?

33:57.803 --> 33:58.601
Miss huff?

34:00.939 --> 34:02.205
Julia?

34:09.148 --> 34:11.147
(baby babbling)
- yes...

34:12.851 --> 34:14.517
- Stop! What are you...

34:15.854 --> 34:19.156
- The nanny let me in. I was
putting a present in her crib.

34:19.158 --> 34:20.891
What on earth has happened?

34:20.893 --> 34:22.159
(baby crying)
- I-I-I'm so sorry.

34:23.362 --> 34:26.262
I saw a man and I panicked.
I-I'm sorry.

34:27.066 --> 34:29.499
- You seem disturbed, detective.

34:29.634 --> 34:32.502
Is there something
you need to confess?

34:37.409 --> 34:39.776
- I had no reason to suspect him

34:39.845 --> 34:42.779
Beyond inexperience
at performing rites.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.314
And I attacked him.

34:46.318 --> 34:48.852
Whoever is doing this
has me second-guessing

34:48.987 --> 34:52.055
Every person I meet,
every thought I have.

34:52.124 --> 34:55.258
- Trust yourself, murdoch.
It never fails for me.

34:55.393 --> 34:58.728
We'll catch whoever
shot the man on the bicycle
and put this to rest.

34:59.832 --> 35:02.399
- Any word on his identity yet?
- Nothing.

35:02.534 --> 35:04.467
Nothing on the clothes, either.

35:04.470 --> 35:06.203
All we have to go on
is the gunrest.

35:06.939 --> 35:07.804
- And?

35:07.939 --> 35:09.739
- Watts is following up
on some names.

35:09.875 --> 35:12.008
I'll let you know
if he finds anything.

35:12.077 --> 35:15.812
But for now, go home,
get some rest.

35:15.814 --> 35:17.580
I'm going to put the kettle on.

35:20.352 --> 35:23.819
- Well, let me tell you,
this device measures

35:23.856 --> 35:27.290
Electromagnetic activity,
which is a crucial indicator

35:27.359 --> 35:29.292
That an alien portal is nearby.

35:29.427 --> 35:31.628
- Mon dieu, this is remarkable.

35:31.697 --> 35:34.464
- Interesting device, george.
Does it work?

35:34.466 --> 35:36.032
- Oh, sir.

35:36.101 --> 35:39.703
Absolutely. I very nearly
found the aliens.

35:39.705 --> 35:40.870
- Oh.

35:42.241 --> 35:44.273
Who gave you this?
- Effie's father.

35:45.777 --> 35:48.311
- Well, that's quite
the interesting family
you're marrying into.

35:48.380 --> 35:49.846
- Indeed it is, sir.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.914
In fact, effie's probably
waiting for me now

35:51.950 --> 35:53.783
Back in wexford.
I'd best be off.

35:53.852 --> 35:56.019
- I would love to join you
on this adventure,

35:56.021 --> 35:57.987
But I have a man to find.

35:59.391 --> 36:01.124
- And I have a family
to tend to.

36:04.663 --> 36:07.731
- Uh, georges, before I go,

36:07.866 --> 36:09.765
Can I ask you
for a spot of advice?

36:09.801 --> 36:10.900
- But of course.

36:10.969 --> 36:13.336
- I need to choose a best man
for my wedding.

36:13.471 --> 36:15.671
It's between the detective
and my friend, henry.

36:15.707 --> 36:18.408
- Who is this henry?
- A fellow constable.

36:18.543 --> 36:22.011
That's his desk, in fact.
A good chap, if a bit lazy.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.613
Right now, he's off enjoying

36:23.748 --> 36:25.348
A series of electric
shock therapies

36:25.384 --> 36:26.549
At the behest of his wife.

36:26.618 --> 36:28.384
- This is his desk?

36:28.420 --> 36:29.819
- That's right.

36:29.821 --> 36:33.223
- I did not mean to intrude,
but whilst looking for a pen,

36:33.225 --> 36:36.659
I did find, um, this.

36:38.063 --> 36:39.896
- Well, yes,
that's likely henry.

36:40.832 --> 36:42.632
But he is a loyal friend.

36:43.869 --> 36:46.235
- You are telling me
that your choice of best man

36:46.271 --> 36:49.773
Is between the great
detective murdoch and this?

36:49.908 --> 36:51.374
(scoffing)

36:51.376 --> 36:54.076
The decision is obvious, no?

36:57.115 --> 36:59.515
- All right. That'll be all.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.719
- Who's next?

37:02.721 --> 37:05.054
- Uh, two more names
on the list.

37:05.090 --> 37:06.590
One's just down here.

37:06.725 --> 37:09.458
But you needn't follow me
around in the cold.

37:09.494 --> 37:11.995
I can handle this.
- It's my pleasure.

37:11.997 --> 37:14.931
And, perhaps,
after those two names
are crossed off,

37:15.066 --> 37:17.667
We can... Get warm.

37:18.537 --> 37:21.271
- Well, I don't know about that.

37:22.541 --> 37:25.675
How do things stand with you
and... What was his name?

37:25.810 --> 37:26.942
- Which one?

37:26.979 --> 37:28.878
(scoffing)
- don't be unkind.

37:28.947 --> 37:31.614
- I'm being honest.
- Yes, well, I suppose

37:31.683 --> 37:36.352
It doesn't matter who.
What matters is it's not
the two of us alone.

37:36.388 --> 37:37.820
- It is right now.

37:38.890 --> 37:40.022
- You know what I mean.

37:41.193 --> 37:43.293
- I care for you tremendously,
llewellyn.

37:43.428 --> 37:46.629
But to be with only you
would be to change who I am.

37:48.099 --> 37:52.235
- It's not who you are,
it's just what you want.

37:52.304 --> 37:54.771
A greed you refuse
to temper even if it means

37:54.906 --> 37:56.773
You'll lose something beautiful.

37:57.576 --> 37:59.442
- Now who's being unkind?

38:00.645 --> 38:02.312
I think I've had enough
of this discussion.

38:03.081 --> 38:04.547
- Wait, milo.

38:04.583 --> 38:07.717
I'm going to look into
the scene of the crime again.

38:07.753 --> 38:09.985
Please, wait.

38:17.562 --> 38:19.729
- You're giving away
your stake in the salon?

38:19.765 --> 38:21.297
- I'm considering it.

38:22.267 --> 38:24.000
Besides, you'll still
run the place.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.402
What does it matter
who your silent partner is?

38:26.538 --> 38:28.605
- It's your father, isn't it?

38:30.142 --> 38:32.441
Violet. Don't do this.

38:33.945 --> 38:35.478
- I have no choice.

38:36.615 --> 38:39.349
- What kind of hold
does that man have on you?

38:39.351 --> 38:41.284
(eerie music)

38:53.031 --> 38:55.898
- Toronto constabulary.
Is someone in there?

38:57.069 --> 38:57.900
Hello?

38:59.638 --> 39:00.837
Open up.

39:14.386 --> 39:16.552
- I know you're the one
behind all of this.

39:17.488 --> 39:18.721
- Of course you do.

39:19.524 --> 39:21.057
You're the great detective.

39:23.661 --> 39:24.927
- But it can't be you.

39:25.663 --> 39:27.096
You're in here.

39:28.266 --> 39:30.466
Unless you have an accomplice.

39:30.502 --> 39:31.901
- Perhaps I do.

39:33.071 --> 39:34.303
Perhaps I don't.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.541
- Just leave me
and my family alone.

39:41.679 --> 39:42.878
- You lied to me.

39:44.082 --> 39:45.815
Broke a promise you made.

39:46.952 --> 39:49.952
What is happening to you
is your doing, not mine.

39:49.988 --> 39:51.688
(indistinct shouting)

39:51.690 --> 39:54.290
- Why is it so warm in here?

39:54.292 --> 39:57.427
- It's warm in hell.
That's why.

39:59.097 --> 40:00.663
You betrayed me.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.968
And a sin against the devil
himself is a sin, nonetheless.

40:07.973 --> 40:11.240
It was your god
who sent me, william.

40:12.310 --> 40:16.112
And it is your god
who will punish you.

40:18.950 --> 40:20.450
(laughing)

40:23.288 --> 40:25.187
(panting)

40:47.612 --> 40:49.512
(air hissing)

41:03.027 --> 41:05.261
(ticking)

41:14.306 --> 41:15.905
(ticking stops)

41:15.974 --> 41:18.107
- William?
Is everything all right?

41:18.176 --> 41:19.709
It's awfully hot in here.

41:19.778 --> 41:21.177
(baby babbling)

41:23.515 --> 41:24.848
- We can't stay here.

41:26.384 --> 41:28.284
Gather your things.
We're leaving.

41:37.896 --> 41:39.795
- I need to renegotiate
our terms.

41:39.865 --> 41:42.999
I'm willing to give you $3,000,
but I am keeping my salon.

41:43.134 --> 41:45.601
That is my only
and final offer.

41:45.637 --> 41:47.203
(chuckling)

41:48.540 --> 41:50.406
- You seem to misunderstand
the predicament you're in.

41:51.743 --> 41:54.944
I want that club.
Either you give it to me,

41:55.013 --> 41:56.812
Or I'll tell everyone about you.

41:56.848 --> 41:58.214
- Don't threaten me.

41:58.283 --> 41:59.749
I'm not a scared
little girl anymore.

41:59.818 --> 42:01.016
- Oh, is that so?

42:02.387 --> 42:03.953
You look scared to me.

42:04.022 --> 42:05.354
- Get your hands off me!

42:05.390 --> 42:07.289
- You do what I say...

42:07.325 --> 42:09.158
Or everything you have
will be gone

42:09.160 --> 42:12.161
When I tell your husband that
you're already a married woman.

42:12.163 --> 42:14.096
- Let me go!

42:14.132 --> 42:16.031
- That's right, mrs. Meadows.

42:17.269 --> 42:21.504
You give me what I want,
or your perfect life is over.

42:38.456 --> 42:42.058
(door opening and closing)

42:44.930 --> 42:46.462
- Milo...
- Hm?

42:46.498 --> 42:47.797
- Thank you for waiting.

42:47.799 --> 42:49.198
- Did you find what you
were looking for?

42:49.234 --> 42:51.267
- Uh, no.

42:51.402 --> 42:53.403
- Llewellyn, we need to finish
our conversation.

42:53.538 --> 42:54.671
- Good.
(gunshot)

42:54.806 --> 42:55.538
(grunts)

42:56.274 --> 42:57.273
- Llewellyn!

42:58.610 --> 42:59.542
Llewellyn!

43:06.017 --> 43:07.950
- The windows are secure.

43:07.953 --> 43:09.686
We should be safe here.

43:09.821 --> 43:11.621
- William, what is going on?

43:11.756 --> 43:13.122
(baby crying)

43:14.059 --> 43:16.292
- Frank rhodes intends
to kill me.

43:17.295 --> 43:19.762
And I plan on not
letting that happen.

43:20.565 --> 43:22.164
- How did it come to this?

43:24.369 --> 43:25.902
- I made a deal with the devil.

43:27.872 --> 43:29.338
And then I broke it.

43:29.908 --> 43:32.508
(dramatic music)

43:41.719 --> 43:43.385
Subtitling: Difuze
