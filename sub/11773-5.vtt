00:17.400 --> 00:19.333
OH!

00:19.367 --> 00:21.933
OH MY GOD!

00:21.967 --> 00:25.100

- OH, GOD, LOOK AT THIS.

00:25.133 --> 00:26.967
LOOK AT THAT.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.767
- WHAT IS THIS?
- IT'S A BOOK ABOUT FREAKS.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.600
- IS THIS TED'S GIFT?
- YEAH.

00:31.633 --> 00:33.700
- THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GIVING
HIM FOR HIS BIRTHDAY?
- YEAH.

00:33.733 --> 00:36.233
- OKAY, YEAH.

00:36.267 --> 00:39.833

00:44.367 --> 00:45.767
I SEE THAT.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.433
I THINK WE REALLY OVERPAID
FOR THOSE PLOTS.

00:47.467 --> 00:49.700
- ( doorbell rings )
- IT'S TOO LATE, AND
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SITE.

00:49.733 --> 00:53.867
HOLD ON. THIS HAS
TO BE THE CAR SERVICE.

00:53.900 --> 00:55.400
- HI, GOOD EVENING,
MISS DAVID?
- YES.

00:55.433 --> 00:57.067
- YOUR CAR'S HERE.
- THANK YOU.
WE'LL BE RIGHT OUT.

00:57.100 --> 01:00.067
- WE'LL BE RIGHT OUT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- OKAY.

01:00.067 --> 01:03.700
- OH, OH, JESUS!
OH, JESUS!
- LARRY, OUR CAR'S HERE.

01:03.733 --> 01:05.767
- OKAY.
- THIS ISN'T FOR YOU,
ACTUALLY.

01:05.800 --> 01:08.367
LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THIS GUY.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.833
LET'S PUT IT AWAY.
WE'RE GOING TO A PARTY.

01:09.867 --> 01:12.533
WE HAVE A CAR.
WE CAN DRINK.
WE CAN HAVE MARGARITAS.

01:12.567 --> 01:14.667
WE CAN HANG OUT,
BE NORMAL.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.533
GREAT IDEA,
THE CAR SERVICE,
GREAT IDEA.

01:22.933 --> 01:25.700
Cheryl:
OKAY, SO WE'LL JUST CALL
YOU IN A FEW HOURS OR SO.

01:25.733 --> 01:28.567
GOOD. WE'LL SEE YOU

A GREAT NIGHT, FOLKS.

01:28.600 --> 01:31.800
Larry:
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
- I'M GONNA BE HERE.

01:31.833 --> 01:37.167
- GOT SOMETHING TO READ?
- NO NO NO, I'LL BE FINE.
I'LL BE FINE. TAKE CARE.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.167
ALL RIGHT.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.067
NO BOOK? NO PAPER?

01:40.067 --> 01:42.533
- NOTHING? A PUZZLE, HUH?
- NO, I--

01:42.567 --> 01:45.433
YOU FOLKS HAVE
A GREAT NIGHT, THOUGH.
HAVE A GREAT PARTY.

01:45.467 --> 01:47.567
I DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT YOU IN THERE?
YOU'LL BE OKAY?

01:47.600 --> 01:49.667
- I'M GREAT.
- OKAY, FINE.

01:49.700 --> 01:53.167
I'LL BE RIGHT HERE
WHEN YOU GET OUT
AND HAVE A GREAT PARTY.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.533
- OKAY.
- THANK YOU.

01:54.567 --> 01:56.967
( mutters ) I COULDN'T
BE ALONE WITH MYSELF
FOR 15 MINUTES.

01:57.067 --> 01:58.433
MY BRAINS WOULD MELT.

01:58.467 --> 02:01.067
HE'S GONNA SIT HERE
FOR THREE HOURS
AND NOT GONNA READ.

02:01.100 --> 02:04.600
NO LADY OR NOTHING.
NO DISTRACTIONS.

02:07.067 --> 02:09.533
BIG NEWS:
THE CEMETERY PLOTS
CAME THROUGH.

02:09.567 --> 02:12.867
SO IT'S JEFF AND SUSIE
AND YOU AND CHERYL AND
ME AND TED

02:12.900 --> 02:14.400
BURIED NEXT TO
EACH OTHER FOREVER.
OH MY GOD.

02:14.433 --> 02:15.867
YEAH, RIGHT.
ISN'T THAT SOMETHING?

02:15.900 --> 02:17.267
- YEAH.
- THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING.

02:17.300 --> 02:20.167
- YEAH, I DON'T WANT--
NOT TOO SOON.
- YEAH, NO.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.833
IT'S TRUE.
WHEN YOU START
TO THINK ABOUT IT,

02:22.867 --> 02:24.833
SOMEBODY'S GOTTA
GO FIRST, I GUESS.

02:24.867 --> 02:28.600
WELL, IT'S NOT GONNA BE ME
AND PROBABLY NOT TED.
WE'RE VERY HEALTHY.

02:28.633 --> 02:30.333
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

02:30.367 --> 02:32.700
- NICE PARTY, HUH?
- THIS IS VERY NICE.

02:32.733 --> 02:35.300
- I DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE
MOST OF THESE PEOPLE.
- REALLY?

02:35.333 --> 02:36.800
YOU KNOW THE RIZMANS.

02:36.833 --> 02:39.933
YEAH YEAH, I'M NOT
THAT CRAZY ABOUT THEM,

02:39.967 --> 02:41.233
FRANKLY, YOU KNOW.

02:41.267 --> 02:43.433
YOU DON'T LIKE
ARNIE RIZMAN?

02:43.467 --> 02:46.167
JUST 'CAUSE THE PERSON'S
BALD DOESN'T MEAN I
HAVE TO LIKE THEM.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.100
OKAY, FORGET IT.
I'M SURE THERE'S SOMEONE
HERE THAT YOU LIKE.

02:49.133 --> 02:50.767
- I'M GONNA GET A DRINK.
- OKAY, ENJOY YOURSELF.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.367
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

02:54.067 --> 02:55.800
- GOOD EVENING.
- GOOD EVENING TO YOU.

02:55.833 --> 02:58.900
- HOW YOU DOING?
- I AM DOING...

02:58.933 --> 03:01.567
PRETTY GOOD.

03:01.600 --> 03:03.800
PRETTY, PRETTY GOOD.

03:03.833 --> 03:07.300
- WHAT CAN I GET YOU?
- YOU GOT A LITTLE BOW TIE
THERE, HUH?

03:07.333 --> 03:10.167
GOT A LITTLE BOW TIE.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.933
THAT'S YOUR IDEA?

03:11.967 --> 03:13.200
NO. NO, IT'S NOT.

03:13.233 --> 03:17.467
YOU KNOW, WE'RE ASKED
TO WEAR IT SOMETIMES.

03:17.500 --> 03:20.700
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN SOMETIMES?
- WELL, WE'RE GIVEN
A WORK-ORDER FORM

03:20.733 --> 03:24.567
WITH A SPECIAL REQUEST,
AND IN THIS CASE,
THERE WAS A REQUEST

03:24.600 --> 03:26.433
FROM MR. DANSON
TO WEAR THE BOW TIE.

03:26.467 --> 03:29.933
- YOU'RE KIDDING.
- NO.

03:29.967 --> 03:33.867
TED DANSON SPECIFICALLY
REQUESTED THAT YOU WEAR
A BOW TIE?

03:33.900 --> 03:34.967
ARE YOU JOKING?

03:35.067 --> 03:36.267
TO DISTINGUISH,
I BELIEVE,

03:36.300 --> 03:40.933
BETWEEN THE GUESTS
AND THE STAFF.

03:40.967 --> 03:43.667
WELL, LOOKS LIKE I'M
GONNA HAVE TO HAVE
A LITTLE TALK

03:43.700 --> 03:45.667
WITH MR. DANSON.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.900
NO NO NO NO,
THAT'S TOTALLY--

03:47.933 --> 03:49.700
THAT'S OKAY.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

03:49.733 --> 03:51.233
- I WANNA SAY A LITTLE
SOMETHING TO HIM.
- PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T.

03:51.267 --> 03:52.967
- I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO.
- YOU DON'T. YOU DON'T.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.333
- HONESTLY, IT'S--
- I DO. I REALLY DO.
THIS IS WRONG.

03:55.367 --> 03:57.067
- IT'S JUST WRONG.
- IT'S UNNECESSARY.

03:57.067 --> 03:59.867
WE'RE ASKED SOMETIMES.
IT'S FINE. IT'S PART
OF THE JOB.

03:59.900 --> 04:01.367
LISTEN, I'M DOING THIS
FOR YOU.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.067
WELL, IF YOU'RE DOING
IT FOR ME, THEN DON'T.

04:04.067 --> 04:06.433
- PLEASE.
- OKAY, I'M DOING IT
FOR ME.

04:06.467 --> 04:08.067
ALSO, PLEASE
DON'T THEN.

04:08.067 --> 04:10.767
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW I OPERATE, OKAY?

04:10.800 --> 04:13.200
- MAYBE NOT, BUT--
- I WILL NOT GET YOU
IN TROUBLE.

04:13.233 --> 04:15.167
I'LL TALK TO HIM.
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

04:15.200 --> 04:18.833
IT WOULD PROBABLY
IMPLICATE ME IN SOME WAY,
AND IT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT.

04:18.867 --> 04:19.833
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- JAMIE.

04:19.867 --> 04:21.833
- JAMIE, OKAY.
- YEAH.

04:21.867 --> 04:24.367
- JAMIE, NICE TO MEET YOU.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.067
I'M GONNA GO SAY
A LITTLE SOMETHING
TO MR. DANSON.

04:26.067 --> 04:27.333
PLEASE DON'T--

04:27.367 --> 04:29.733
IN A FEW MINUTES,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BE WEARING A BOW TIE.

04:29.767 --> 04:32.133
I DON'T MIND
WEARING IT THAT MUCH.
I'D RATHER YOU DON'T.

04:32.167 --> 04:34.400
YOU'RE GONNA SAY,
"LARRY, THANK YOU FOR
GETTING RID OF MY BOW TIE."

04:34.433 --> 04:38.300
I THANK YOU, LARRY,
TO NOT SAY ANYTHING
TO MR. DANSON.

04:38.333 --> 04:42.433
JAMIE, I GOTTA
SAY SOMETHING.

04:42.467 --> 04:44.067
YOU DON'T.

04:44.067 --> 04:46.667
- I HAVE TO.
I COULDN'T LIVE WITH MYSELF.
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.233
JUST TRUST ME.
I KNOW HOW TO TALK
TO PEOPLE.

04:48.267 --> 04:50.733
- I DO TRUST YOU,
BUT PLEASE DON'T.
- THAT'S GOTTA GO.

04:50.767 --> 04:53.133
- THAT'S GOTTA GO, JAMIE.
- IT DOESN'T HAVE TO.

04:53.167 --> 04:56.333
- PLEASE, PLEASE.
- NAH-AH-AH.

04:58.433 --> 05:00.733
- HEY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
- HEY.

05:00.767 --> 05:03.133
YEAH, YEAH, I'D HUG YOU,
BUT I KNOW YOU GOT A PHOBIA.

05:03.167 --> 05:06.367
YEAH, WE DON'T NEED
TO GO THAT FAR,
YOU KNOW?

05:06.400 --> 05:07.867
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
- YEAH.

05:07.900 --> 05:09.433
WHY'D YOU MAKE
THIS POOR KID

05:09.467 --> 05:12.933
- WEAR A BOW TIE?
BARTENDER?
- OH!

05:12.967 --> 05:14.933
Larry:
GOT HIM IN A BOW TIE?
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

05:14.967 --> 05:18.067
WE HAD A CHOICE.
NO BOW TIE, BOW TIE.
WE WENT WITH BOW TIE.

05:18.067 --> 05:20.967
- CLASSES UP THE PARTY
A LITTLE BIT, I THINK.
- REALLY?

05:21.067 --> 05:23.733
MAKES ME A LITTLE
UNCOMFORTABLE SEEING
A GUY LIKE THAT,

05:23.767 --> 05:26.600
HAVE TO STAND THERE,
WEAR A BOW TIE
THE WHOLE NIGHT.

05:26.633 --> 05:28.933
- THAT'S NOT COOL.
- IT LOOKS ELEGANT.

05:28.967 --> 05:31.067
FEEL LIKE YOU'RE PUTTING
ON AIRS OR SOMETHING,
YOU KNOW?

05:31.067 --> 05:33.200
- I'M PUTTING ON AIRS?
- A LITTLE BIT, YEAH.

05:33.233 --> 05:36.067
YOU KNOW, WHAT IS IT?
SO YOU FEEL GOOD?

05:36.067 --> 05:37.533
HE'S GOTTA FEEL BAD
SO YOU CAN FEEL GOOD?

05:37.567 --> 05:38.900
IS THAT HOW THE WORLD
WORKS FOR YOU?

05:38.933 --> 05:41.500
- DID HE SAY SOMETHING
TO YOU?
- NO, HE DIDN'T.

05:41.533 --> 05:42.900
- HE DID, DIDN'T HE?
- NO, HE DID NOT.

05:42.933 --> 05:45.733
- WHAT DID HE SAY?
- HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

05:45.767 --> 05:47.300
- BULLSHIT.
- HE SAID HE'D RATHER
I WOULDN'T TALK TO YOU,

05:47.333 --> 05:49.500
THAT'S WHAT
HE SAID, BUT...

05:49.533 --> 05:50.933
- CAN'T TAKE
THE BOW TIE OFF?
- NO.

05:50.967 --> 05:53.267
- THAT'S YOUR FINAL ANSWER?
- THAT'S MY FINAL ANSWER.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.367
- FINAL ANSWER?
- YEAH, NO DEAL.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.633
PFFT! WHATEVER
YOU WANT, YOU KNOW?

05:56.667 --> 05:59.267
- COME ON, LARRY, PLEASE.
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

05:59.300 --> 06:02.167
I FEEL LIKE A JERK
'CAUSE I KIND OF
PROMISED HIM.

06:02.200 --> 06:05.267
WELL, TOO BAD.
GO BACK AND SAY
YOU FAILED.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.833
OKAY, I WILL.
ONE MORE THING:

06:07.867 --> 06:10.400
I GOT A DRIVER
OUT THERE.

06:10.433 --> 06:12.333
I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD
BRING HIM IN THE HOUSE.

06:12.367 --> 06:16.567
HE'S SITTING OUT THERE.
HE'LL BE OUT THERE
FOR THREE HOURS.

06:16.600 --> 06:17.767
DO YOU MIND
IF I BRING HIM IN?

06:17.800 --> 06:20.067
WHY DON'T WE JUST SEND
SOME COFFEE OUT TO HIM?

06:20.067 --> 06:22.767
SEND COFFEE OUT TO HIM?
COME ON, WHAT IS THAT?

06:22.800 --> 06:25.533
LET ME BRING HIM IN.
HE'LL SIT IN A CORNER.
HE WON'T BOTHER ANYBODY.

06:25.567 --> 06:27.233
IT'S HIS JOB TO SIT
IN THE CAR AND WAIT
WHILE YOU HAVE FUN.

06:27.267 --> 06:30.067
I KNOW IT'S HIS JOB,
BUT LISTEN, I USED TO DRIVE.

06:30.100 --> 06:32.433
I KNOW HOW IT FEELS
TO SIT IN A CAR
FOR THREE HOURS

06:32.467 --> 06:35.933
AND DO NOTHING
AND FREEZE AND NOT BE
ABLE TO PUT THE RADIO ON

06:35.967 --> 06:38.467
OR THE LIGHTS.
YOU CAN'T READ.
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.833
- YOU DROVE LIMOS?
- YEAH, I DID DRIVE LIMOS.

06:40.867 --> 06:42.267
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

06:42.300 --> 06:44.500
- DID YOU WEAR
A LITTLE BOW TIE?
- NO, I DID NOT.

06:44.533 --> 06:46.833
THE WOMAN WAS BLIND
AND COULDN'T SEE.

06:46.867 --> 06:49.100
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

06:49.133 --> 06:50.533
I DIDN'T EVEN
WEAR THE UNIFORM.

06:50.567 --> 06:52.267
- REALLY?
- YEAH, SHE COULDN'T
SEE A THING.

06:52.300 --> 06:54.333
THE CAR WAS FILTHY,
BUT ANYWAY, THAT'S
ANOTHER STORY.

06:54.367 --> 06:56.933
BRING HIM IN.
I DON'T CARE.
PUT HIM IN THE BACK.

06:56.967 --> 07:00.200
- REALLY? THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.
- YEAH. YOU'RE WELCOME.

07:00.233 --> 07:02.567
- YOU HAPPY NOW?
- I'M HAPPY.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.100
- STILL NO ON THE...
- NO.

07:04.133 --> 07:06.533
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA
GO GET HIM. THANKS, MAN.
- OKAY.

07:09.133 --> 07:12.067
- WHO'S THIS FROM AGAIN?
- BARNEY AND ELLEN.

07:12.100 --> 07:14.267
OH, LOOK AT THAT.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.533
- Ted: THANK YOU!
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- IT'S NICE.

07:16.567 --> 07:19.233
- WHO THIS?
DOESN'T HAVE A NAME?
- NANCY AND GEORGE.

07:19.267 --> 07:21.467
YOU EXCITED
ABOUT TOMORROW NIGHT?

07:21.500 --> 07:23.667
- WHAT'S TOMORROW NIGHT?
- THE McCARTNEY CONCERT.

07:23.700 --> 07:26.600
- OH, YEAH, RIGHT.
- HOW OFTEN DO YOU
GO TO CONCERTS?

07:26.633 --> 07:29.267
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I AM EXCITED.
- YEAH, I AM TOO.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.467
- WE'LL GO OUT TO DINNER.
IT'LL BE FUN.
- YEAH, IT'LL BE FUN.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.433
- THIS IS GREAT.
THESE DO A LOT OF GOOD.
- YEAH.

07:33.467 --> 07:35.067
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS,
EVERYBODY?

07:35.067 --> 07:37.633
- Jeff: OH, THE BONO PHONE.
- Larry: OH, THAT'S GREAT.

07:37.667 --> 07:40.700
- GIVES MONEY TO AIDS
IN AFRICA.
- Ted: OH, THAT'S SO GREAT.

07:40.733 --> 07:43.333
THAT DOESN'T AFFECT
HETEROSEXUALS, RIGHT?

07:45.100 --> 07:47.067
- Jeff: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- THE GUY'S IMPOSSIBLE.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.767
- Ted: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- IT'S NOT FUNNY.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.833
IT'S A JOKE, PEOPLE.
IT'S A JOKE, COME ON.

07:50.867 --> 07:53.600
- OKAY.
- I'M NOT SURE.

07:53.633 --> 07:56.700
WHAT IS THAT?
OH, THAT'S MINE.
HEY!

07:56.733 --> 07:58.600
- Ted: THIS IS THE ONE
YOU TOLD ME ABOUT?
- THAT'S IT, YEAH.

07:58.633 --> 08:01.467
- "MONDO..."
- "MONDO FREAKS."

08:01.500 --> 08:03.267
Larry: "MONDO FREAKS."

08:04.800 --> 08:07.067
LEAF THROUGH IT.

08:11.433 --> 08:13.767
HUH?
ARE YOU LOVING THAT?

08:13.800 --> 08:16.133
WELL, THANK YOU, LARRY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

08:16.167 --> 08:18.200
YOU'RE WELCOME.
IT'S A GREAT
COFFEE-TABLE BOOK.

08:18.233 --> 08:19.733
OH, YEAH, WAIT.

08:19.767 --> 08:22.300
I WANNA JUST SHOW IT
TO JEFF, OKAY?

08:22.333 --> 08:25.067
YEAH, THANKS.

08:25.067 --> 08:27.533
ALL RIGHT, WHAT HAVE
WE GOT NEXT HERE?

08:27.567 --> 08:29.767
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.367
- Ted: OH OH, YEAH.
- ( laughing )

08:37.567 --> 08:39.467
OKAY--

08:43.900 --> 08:46.667
- IT'S PETE PETERSON.
- Ted: ALL RIGHT,
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?

08:46.700 --> 08:50.367
Jeff:
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.567
- WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?

08:54.200 --> 08:57.100

09:05.633 --> 09:07.300
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BECKER.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.333
( laughing )

09:12.833 --> 09:14.867
OH, JESUS.

09:17.533 --> 09:20.400
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
WHO IS HE?

09:20.433 --> 09:23.500
- DOES ANYONE KNOW?
- Larry: UM...

09:23.533 --> 09:26.300
- I THINK THAT'S MY DRIVER.
- THAT'S YOUR DRIVER?

09:26.333 --> 09:28.467
THIS IS THE GUY
YOU BROUGHT INTO
MY HOUSE?

09:28.500 --> 09:32.433
- I'M SORRY, MAN.
- YOU'RE SORRY?
THAT GUY'S PLASTERED.

09:32.467 --> 09:34.767
- IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
HE DIDN'T DO IT ON PURPOSE.
- Mary: GET OFF ME!

09:34.800 --> 09:36.567
GOD, GET--

09:36.600 --> 09:39.533

09:44.900 --> 09:47.900

09:47.933 --> 09:49.567
- I DON'T BELIEVE HIM.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.933

YOU'RE OUT OF HERE.
GO ON.

09:51.967 --> 09:53.367

09:53.400 --> 09:55.367

09:55.400 --> 09:57.933
- WHAT? IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

09:57.967 --> 10:00.567

10:00.600 --> 10:04.633
HE GROPES MY WIFE,
AND HE BREAKS--
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!

10:04.667 --> 10:06.133
- FINE, FINE, I'M LEAVING!
- GO ON.

10:06.167 --> 10:09.200
FINE. HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.833
- I'M SORRY.
- OH CHERYL,

10:11.867 --> 10:13.267
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

10:13.300 --> 10:15.400
- Driver: THAT WAS
A BULLSHIT PARTY.
- Larry: YEAH.

10:15.433 --> 10:17.333
Driver:
LET'S GET OUT
OF HERE. GET IN.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.900
- NO, YOU'RE
NOT DRIVING.
- I'M TOTALLY FINE.

10:19.933 --> 10:22.300
- ARE YOU CRAZY?
YOU'RE NOT DRIVING.
- I'M NOT THAT DRUNK.

10:22.333 --> 10:24.000
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- HEY, I KNOW.

10:24.033 --> 10:25.667
I'M JUST JOKING AROUND.
BUT SERIOUSLY,

10:25.700 --> 10:27.433
YOU TWO, GET IN.
I'M DRIVING.

10:27.467 --> 10:29.133
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
YOU CAN'T DRIVE.
YOU'RE DRUNK.

10:29.167 --> 10:32.200
YOU ARE NOT
GONNA DRIVE US HOME.
NOBODY IN THEIR RIGHT MIND

10:32.233 --> 10:33.867
- WOULD GET IN A CAR
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.
- COME ON, GET IN THE CAR.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.467

10:36.500 --> 10:38.133
DON'T FORGET ME, BUD.

10:38.167 --> 10:40.567

TO DRIVE A LIMO?
- I DON'T KNOW.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.033
- HEY, CHARLIE.

10:42.067 --> 10:44.167

COMPARTMENT.

11:34.300 --> 11:36.467
HUH? YOU PARTY

11:36.500 --> 11:38.633
NO, WE WEREN'T PARTYING.

11:38.667 --> 11:40.467
NO, HE WAS DRIVING US.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.433
AND HE HAD
TOO MUCH TO DRINK,
SO WE THOUGHT...

11:43.467 --> 11:45.200

11:45.233 --> 11:48.733

11:51.733 --> 11:54.933

11:54.967 --> 11:57.600
THIS IS THE SHITSTORM
OF MY LIFE. IT'S SHIT.

11:57.633 --> 12:00.433
YEAH, IT DOESN'T
LOOK THAT GREAT.

12:00.467 --> 12:02.800
NO, IT ISN'T.
AREN'T YOU PRETTY?

12:02.833 --> 12:03.900
- DON'T YOU LOOK NICE?
- YOU'RE PRETTY.

12:03.933 --> 12:06.133
- YOU'RE PRETTY.
- VERY ATTRACTIVE.

12:06.167 --> 12:08.967
- Dad: TELL 'EM TO STOP
PLAYING THE MUSIC.
- SHUT UP!

12:09.067 --> 12:11.233
WE HAVE NO WAY
TO GET HOME TONIGHT
BECAUSE--

12:11.267 --> 12:12.733
NO, CLEARLY
HE CAN'T DRIVE.

12:12.767 --> 12:14.700
I WOULD OFFER YOU
THE UPSTAIRS ROOM, BUT
MY DAD IS A FUCKING MESS.

12:14.733 --> 12:17.067
CAN WE TAKE
THE LIMO HOME?

12:17.100 --> 12:18.233
I'LL BRING IT BACK
TOMORROW. I PROMISE.

12:18.267 --> 12:20.400
Charlie: YOU GOTTA
BRING IT BACK, MAN.

12:20.433 --> 12:22.067
I DON'T
NEED YOU

12:22.067 --> 12:24.233
- THANK YOU.
- I'M SORRY I COULDN'T
INVITE YOU IN FOR A SNACK.

12:24.267 --> 12:26.167
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THERE'S NOTHING
IN THE CUPBOARD.

12:26.200 --> 12:29.333
- Dad: I DON'T WANT THAT DOG
SHITTING IN MY YARD!
- DADDY, SO HELP ME!

12:30.800 --> 12:33.900
Cheryl:
THIS IS GONNA BE SO FUN.

12:33.933 --> 12:35.367
I'M SO LOOKING FORWARD
TO THIS CONCERT.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.300
H, MY GOSH,
YOU'RE WEARING A SUIT.

12:37.333 --> 12:39.067
THIS IS LIKEA REAL DATE.

12:39.067 --> 12:41.933
GONNA GO TO DINNER
AND GO TO A CONCERT
AND HANG OUT.

12:41.967 --> 12:43.233
OH MY GOD.
YOU KNOW WHAT I HEARD?

12:43.267 --> 12:47.067
I HEARD THAT HEATHER MILLS
AND PAUL McCARTNEY

12:47.067 --> 12:48.267
MIGHT BE GETTING
BACK TOGETHER.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.200
- OH, HOW EXCITING.
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

12:50.233 --> 12:52.733
- I'M A ALL ATWITTER.
- SHE MIGHT EVEN
BE THERE TONIGHT.

12:52.767 --> 12:55.800
- REALLY?

12:55.833 --> 12:58.067
YOU KNOW,
I GOTTA TELL YA,

12:58.067 --> 13:00.633
- I'M THINKING ABOUT
THIS TED DANSON THING.
- YEAH.

13:02.667 --> 13:04.600
I DON'T THINK I
WANNA BE BURIED
NEXT TO THIS GUY.

13:04.633 --> 13:06.633
THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

13:06.667 --> 13:08.967
SO I WAS THINKING
MAYBE...

13:09.067 --> 13:12.733
MAYBE YOU'LL SWITCH PLOTS
WITH ME, SO YOU'LL BE
BETWEEN US.

13:12.767 --> 13:14.700
I DON'T CARE.

13:14.733 --> 13:17.933
BUT YOU KNOW THAT MEANS THAT
YOU'LL BE NEXT TO SUSIE.

13:17.967 --> 13:19.433
SO YOU'RE GONNA NEED
HER PERMISSION.

13:19.467 --> 13:21.533
- I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU DO.
- ( doorbell rings )

13:21.567 --> 13:23.933
OH, HEY, THAT'S THEM.

13:23.967 --> 13:26.300
OH, I'LL GET IT.

13:26.333 --> 13:28.633

13:28.667 --> 13:31.133

13:31.167 --> 13:34.467
HEY, GUYS.
HEY, YOU LOOK GREAT.
OH, LOOK, A SUIT TOO.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.167
- I KNOW.
ISN'T THAT NICE?
- YEAH, YOU DO LOOK GOOD.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.067
- I LOVE THIS OUTFIT.

13:39.067 --> 13:41.533
OH, YEAH, IT'S GREAT--
THE PINK. I LOVE
THIS STUFF.

13:41.567 --> 13:43.067
WOW, GLAD YOU LIKE IT.

13:43.067 --> 13:45.667
- Larry: REALLY NICE, YEAH.
- Susie: IT'S A ROCK STARTHING.

13:45.700 --> 13:48.500
- GREAT COMBO.
YEAH, LOOKS TERRIFIC.
- GLAD YOU LIKE IT.

13:48.533 --> 13:51.700
- YOU WANT SOME WINE, CHEESE?
- I'D LOVE SOME WINE.
THAT'D BE GREAT.

13:51.733 --> 13:54.267
WHERE'S THE FREAK BOOK?

13:54.300 --> 13:56.067
- LEFT IT IN THE CAR.
- OH, MAN, ALL RIGHT.

13:56.100 --> 13:57.500
- I'M SORRY.
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

13:57.533 --> 14:00.400
HOW ABOUT A TOAST?
TO GOOD FRIENDS,
GOOD FRIENDSHIP.

14:00.433 --> 14:03.733
- NICE, VERY NICE,
VERY NICE.
- TO FRIENDSHIP?

14:03.767 --> 14:06.300
YOU KNOW, YOU WEREN'T
THERE LAST NIGHT.

14:06.333 --> 14:08.600
- NO, I HEARD.
- TED DANSON,

14:08.633 --> 14:10.267
I HAVE HAD IT
WITH THIS GUY.

14:10.300 --> 14:13.133
- HE'S A LITTLE POMPOUS
LATELY, I NOTICE.
- SO FULL OF HIMSELF.

14:13.167 --> 14:16.700
LET ME JUST SAY THIS, OKAY?
I DON'T WANNA BE BURIED
NEXT TO THIS GUY.

14:16.733 --> 14:18.300
I REALLY DON'T.
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT IT.

14:18.333 --> 14:19.933
I WAS TALKING TO CHERYL,
AND I ASKED CHERYL

14:19.967 --> 14:22.200
IF SHE'D SWITCH PLOTS
WITH ME, AND SHE AGREED.

14:22.233 --> 14:24.200
- SO NOW I'LL BE BURIED
NEXT TO YOU.
- NEXT TO ME?

14:24.233 --> 14:26.533
YEAH, NEXT TO YOU,
SO THAT'S THAT.

14:26.567 --> 14:29.567
I DON'T REALLY LIKE
THAT, LAR. I DON'T
LIKE THAT.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.533
- WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE I LIKED IT
THE WAY IT WAS.

14:31.567 --> 14:33.400
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

14:33.433 --> 14:35.933
BECAUSE, LARRY, HONESTLY,
I DON'T WANNA BE NEXT
TO YOU FOR ETERNITY.

14:35.967 --> 14:37.267
MAY I BE SO BOLD?

14:37.300 --> 14:39.200
YOUR BEST SELF EMERGES
AFTER YOU'RE DEAD.

14:39.233 --> 14:41.767
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
FOR A FACT.
- I DO KNOW. I CAME BACK.

14:41.800 --> 14:45.067
GUESS WHAT. EVEN YOUR
BEST SELF, I'M NOT
INTERESTED FOR ETERNITY.

14:47.567 --> 14:49.333
I TAKE BACK MY TOAST.

14:49.367 --> 14:50.867
- GOOD FRIENDS?
- FINE, TAKE BACK YOUR TOAST.

14:50.900 --> 14:54.067
I TAKE BACK THE TOAST,
AND I TAKE BACK WHAT
I SAID ABOUT YOUR OUTFIT.

14:54.100 --> 14:56.567
WELL, YOU ONLY SAID IT
'CAUSE YOU HAD THIS
IN MIND

14:56.600 --> 14:58.567
TO GET ME TO SWITCH PLOTS.
THERE'S ALWAYS AN ULTERIOR
MOTIVE.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.867
IF YOU WERE MARRIED TO ME,
I NEVER WOULD HAVE LET YOU
OUT OF THE HOUSE WITH THAT.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.233
THAT'S FINE.
I'M NOT MARRIED TO YOU.

15:02.267 --> 15:04.433
AND I'M NOT GONNA BE
NEXT TO YOU FOREVER
AND EVER AND EVER.

15:04.467 --> 15:06.933
- I WANT SOME PEACE
AND QUIET.
- OKAY, FINE.

15:06.967 --> 15:09.667
HOW ABOUT THIS?
I'LL SWITCH WITH CHERYL,

15:09.700 --> 15:11.200
BUT THEN YOU SWITCH
WITH JEFF.

15:11.233 --> 15:13.800
- I CAN'T DO THAT.
I NEED TO BE ON THE END.
- THAT'S TRUE.

15:13.833 --> 15:17.067
Jeff:
I'M CLAUSTROPHOBIC. I CAN'T
BE ANYWHERE BUT THE END.

15:17.067 --> 15:18.633
HE HYPERVENTILATES.
HE HAS TO BE ON THE END.

15:18.667 --> 15:22.100
- YEAH, IT'S NOT GOOD.
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S
NOT GOOD, OKAY?

15:22.133 --> 15:23.900
THE SELFISHNESS
THAT'S GOING ON HERE.

15:23.933 --> 15:27.433
NO, I WANNA BE NEXT TO
MY GODDAMN HUSBAND FOR
ETERNITY, NOT TED DANSON.

15:27.467 --> 15:30.700
- THAT'S THE WAY WE LAY THERE.
I MADE A VOW TO HIM, LARRY.
- OKAY, FINE, WE'RE LEAVING.

15:30.733 --> 15:33.433
WE'RE LEAVING THIS CEMETERY.
WE'RE GETTING ANOTHER PLOT.

15:33.467 --> 15:36.267
- NO, WE'RE NOT.
NO, WE ARE NOT.
- YES, WE ARE! YES, WE ARE!

15:36.300 --> 15:38.167
NOBODY'S SWITCHING?
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING TO ME?

15:38.200 --> 15:39.767
WE SHOULD KEEP IT
THE WAY IT IS.

15:39.800 --> 15:43.433
YOU'RE GONNA KEEP IT
THE WAY IT IS? FINE, FINE.
ENJOY YOUR EVENING, OKAY?

15:43.467 --> 15:46.300
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
- I'M GOING. I'M GOING.

15:46.333 --> 15:48.067
YOU DON'T WANNA BE BURIED
NEXT TO ME WHEN YOU'RE DEAD,

15:48.100 --> 15:50.667
I CAN ASSUME YOU DON'T
WANNA BE NEXT TO ME
WHEN YOU'RE ALIVE.

15:50.700 --> 15:53.067
I'LL SEE YOU
AT THE CONCERT.

15:53.100 --> 15:55.967
- HE'S A DRAMA QUEEN.
HE'S OVERREACTING.
- I DON'T KNOW.

15:56.067 --> 15:58.167
LIKE A LITTLE GIRL. WHAT WAS
THAT? THAT WAS NOTHING.

15:58.200 --> 16:01.600
- WHERE'S THE CAR?
- LEON TOOK IT.

16:01.633 --> 16:03.800
HE DIDN'T ASK ME.

16:03.833 --> 16:06.167
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I'M TAKING THE LIMO.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.967
- LIMO?
- HE'S OUT OF HIS MIND.

16:08.067 --> 16:09.400
HE'S DRIVING A LIMO?

16:18.833 --> 16:19.867
( crash )

16:26.100 --> 16:27.767
Larry: OH! OH, FUCK!

16:48.833 --> 16:50.433
( cell phone rings )

16:53.067 --> 16:56.967
- HELLO.
- LARRY, HEY, IT'S CHARLIE,
THE LIMO DRIVER.

16:57.067 --> 16:58.867
- HELLO, CHARLIE.
- I'm sorry about last night.

16:58.900 --> 17:00.833
YEAH, BOY OH BOY,
YOU SHOULD BE.

17:00.867 --> 17:03.967
- YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD
TO GO THROUGH THAT.
- Yeah, that was pretty bad.

17:04.067 --> 17:07.133
I didn't mean
to get that drunk.
I just got out of hand.

17:07.167 --> 17:10.133
I DID YOU A FAVOR.
I LET YOU IN THE HOUSE.
IT WAS PRETTY AWFUL.

17:10.167 --> 17:13.733
I'M SO-- I'M SO--
OH, GOD, I'M SO SORRY.

17:13.767 --> 17:15.667
GUESS WHAT.
I'M IN THE LIMO RIGHT NOW.
DO YOU WANT ME TO RETURN IT?

17:15.700 --> 17:17.567
Look, man,
you gotta do me a huge favor.

17:17.600 --> 17:19.900
I GOTTA PICK SOMEBODY UP
IN 30 MINUTES AT THE AIRPORT.

17:19.933 --> 17:23.200
HE'S THIS HUGE VIP CLIENT,
AND I CAN'T GET THERE, MAN.

17:23.233 --> 17:24.800
They just called.
You gotta go pick him up.

17:24.833 --> 17:27.067
- WHAT ARE YOU, KIDDING ME?
- No, please, seriously.

17:27.100 --> 17:30.167
I'M NOT GONNA GO PICK
SOMEBODY UP AT THE AIRPORT.

17:30.200 --> 17:31.967
If I don't get this,
I lose my job, man.

17:32.067 --> 17:33.900
AND MY WIFE IS
GONNA LOSE HER HEALTH CARE.

17:33.933 --> 17:36.200
WE'RE GONNA LOSE
EVERYTHING, MAN.
THE HOUSE GOES TOO.

17:36.233 --> 17:38.133
I CAN'T PICK SOMEBODY UP
AT THE AIRPORT.

17:38.167 --> 17:40.967
- ARE YOU INSANE?
- LARRY, DO ME A FAVOR.
COME ON, MAN.

17:41.067 --> 17:43.233
- OH, JESUS.
- Please, Larry,

17:43.267 --> 17:44.900
FOR GOD'S SAKE--
FOR MY FAMILY.

19:30.300 --> 19:31.867
LIKE, I WAS SHY
WHEN I WAS A KID.

19:31.900 --> 19:34.833
PEOPLE ALWAYS SAYING,
"DON'T BE SHY. DON'T BE SHY."

19:34.867 --> 19:36.567
WHAT, DO YOU THINK
YOU HAVE CONTROL
OF BEING SHY?

19:36.600 --> 19:38.800

PING PONG'S MY GAME.
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING:

19:42.233 --> 19:44.700
I THINK IT'S A LOT
HARDER THAN TENNIS,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT.

19:44.733 --> 19:46.933
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE
WITH THAT, CHARLIE.

19:46.967 --> 19:50.500
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR FUN?
HOW DOES A JOHN McENROE
HAVE FUN?

19:50.533 --> 19:53.933
I LIKE TO BE QUIET NOW,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

19:53.967 --> 19:57.500
- YOU WATCH A LOT OF TV?
- LOT OF SPORTS.

19:57.533 --> 19:58.767
- YOU HAVE ALLERGIES?

19:58.800 --> 20:01.567
DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD,

20:05.133 --> 20:08.100
- YOU LIKE LIFE?
- YEAH, I LIKE LIFE!

20:08.133 --> 20:10.800
- DO YOU GARDEN?
- I DON'T GARDEN, OKAY?

20:10.833 --> 20:14.133
IF YOU TALK TO PEOPLE
WHO GARDEN, THEY'LL ALL
TELL YOU THE SAME THING:

20:14.167 --> 20:16.733
THEY FIND IT VERY RELAXING
AND MEDITATIVE.

20:16.767 --> 20:19.433
AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT.
I ADMIT IT. I'M JEALOUS
OF THE GARDENER.

20:19.467 --> 20:22.300
- HAVE YOU EVER BEEN JEALOUS
OF A GARDENER?
- NO, I HAVEN'T, ACTUALLY.

20:22.333 --> 20:23.933

20:30.200 --> 20:32.667
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL
TO TALK ABOUT THAT?

20:32.700 --> 20:34.833
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
I HAVE SEX ONCE A WEEK--

20:34.867 --> 20:37.000
GOOD WEEK, TWICE.
BUT I CAN GO MORE

20:37.033 --> 20:39.400
HEY, THAT'S REALLY

20:39.433 --> 20:41.467
Larry: OH MY GOD.

20:41.500 --> 20:44.500
FOR TWO MINUTES--
WOULD THAT BE OKAY--
AT THIS CEMETERY?

20:44.533 --> 20:47.033
- IN THIS CEMETERY?
- YEAH, IT'S RIGHT HERE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

20:47.067 --> 20:49.167
I JUST NEED

21:01.800 --> 21:04.167
HEY, CHARLIE,

21:08.900 --> 21:10.533
- GREAT. LOOKS WONDERFUL.
- IT'S A LOT OF FUN.

21:10.567 --> 21:13.067
CHECK OUT THE FREAKS,
MR. McENROE.

21:20.367 --> 21:23.900
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU HAD.
WHAT YOU HAD WAS THE BEST
WE HAVE TO OFFER.

21:23.933 --> 21:25.933
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY
SPECTACULAR.

21:25.967 --> 21:28.200
YEAH, WELL,
I'M DONE WITH THAT ONE.

21:28.233 --> 21:30.867
HOWEVER,
THIS IS NOT BAD.

21:30.900 --> 21:32.967
YOU HAVE A NICE CLASS

21:33.067 --> 21:34.567

21:37.500 --> 21:40.433
CAN I GET A REFUND
ON THE OTHER PLOT?

21:40.467 --> 21:42.367
NO, I CAN'T DO THAT,

21:42.400 --> 21:45.067
BUT YOU CAN SELL IT
PRIVATELY IF YOU LIKE.

21:45.067 --> 21:46.567
OKAY, THAT'S FAIR.
OKAY.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.467
I'LL TAKE IT.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.567
NO NO NO NO NO,

22:40.600 --> 22:43.300
THIS IS NOT YOUR LIMO.

22:43.333 --> 22:46.267
I PAY YOU. I DO WHATEVER.
JUST TAKE MY SISTER HOME.

22:46.300 --> 22:48.867

22:57.900 --> 23:00.500
JUST GET OUT.

23:00.533 --> 23:02.200
THEY THINK IT'S THEIR CAR.
I DON'T KNOW.

23:02.233 --> 23:03.833
- GET IN, GET IN.
- WHAT IS THIS?

23:03.867 --> 23:06.067
WHY IS HE COMING IN?
WHY ARE YOU--

23:06.067 --> 23:08.367

23:08.400 --> 23:10.800

23:44.067 --> 23:47.300
WE ARE NOWHERE NEAR--
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
THIS PLACE IS.

23:47.333 --> 23:48.900
- I CAN'T FIND THIS PLACE.
- ( woman speaks Spanish )

23:48.933 --> 23:51.067
- WHAT?
- YOU HAVE TO
JUST MAKE A LEFT TURN.

23:51.100 --> 23:52.533
NO, THIS ISN'T CLOSE.

23:52.567 --> 23:55.800
YOU SAID 8th STREET, RIGHT?
THIS IS NOT 8th STREET.

23:55.833 --> 23:57.433
CHARLIE, I DIDN'T PAY
FOR THIS. COME ON!

23:57.467 --> 24:00.067
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS MAKE A LEFT TURN.

24:00.100 --> 24:03.533
YOU TOLD ME TO GO THIS WAY.
I WENT COMPLETELY
THE WRONG WAY.

24:03.567 --> 24:06.533
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE A DRIVER.
- IT'S THE OTHER WAY, I THINK.

24:06.567 --> 24:09.067
OKAY, YOU JUST SAID
THE WORD, "I THINK."
DON'T THINK.

24:09.100 --> 24:10.633

24:21.500 --> 24:23.633
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S IT!

24:23.667 --> 24:26.433
THAT'S IT.
I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE!

24:26.467 --> 24:28.867
CHARLIE,

( crowd shushes )

26:09.867 --> 26:13.267
Heather:

26:13.300 --> 26:14.933
WHY WOULD I CALL

26:14.967 --> 26:16.333

27:25.400 --> 27:28.133
