By the way, you left your

17:26.045 --> 17:27.672
- What? I did not.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.857
didn't take my keys.

17:45.899 --> 17:47.942
I told you so.

Will you forgive me and

17:47.984 --> 17:50.486

Girls, it's not what you think.

Karen and I have decided

18:16.470 --> 18:18.848
we're just gonna be friends.

18:18.890 --> 18:21.475
Oh, I'm sorry, Dad.

But don't worry.

Steph, that's a man.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.240
It is?

18:37.533 --> 18:40.787
So, Danny, what excuse

18:37.533 --> 18:40.787
did you use this time?

18:40.828 --> 18:41.871
What do you mean?

18:41.913 --> 18:43.289
I mean, you find something wrong

18:43.330 --> 18:45.332
with every girl you go out with.

18:45.374 --> 18:47.209
I don't know what

18:45.374 --> 18:47.209
you're talking about.

Come on, Michelle. Let's finish

18:47.251 --> 18:49.879
that Popsicle in the kitchen.

18:49.921 --> 18:51.464
I'll see you, Jojo.

Oh, come on, Jess.

18:51.505 --> 18:53.382
You gotta help me with Danny.

18:53.424 --> 18:55.969
- I gotta go to my rehearsal.

18:53.424 --> 18:55.969
- You're already six hours late.

18:56.010 --> 18:57.553
What's a couple more minutes?

19:05.770 --> 19:07.897
Alright, Danny, what happened?

19:07.939 --> 19:10.357
We had a great time. We, uh,

19:07.939 --> 19:10.357
went out for Chinese food.

19:10.399 --> 19:13.820
Then we sang on the ferry and

19:10.399 --> 19:13.820
then we went to her apartment.

19:13.861 --> 19:16.781
Her apartment? Oh, yeah.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.033
Well, it was then that

19:16.823 --> 19:19.033
I found out that I had spent

19:19.075 --> 19:22.036
the entire day kissing...a slob.

19:22.078 --> 19:24.413
(together)

19:22.078 --> 19:24.413
Oh! No!

19:25.372 --> 19:27.207
Her place was a pigsty.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.376
There were clothes everywhere.

19:29.418 --> 19:31.712
I thought her hamper exploded.

Oh, why is it every

19:31.754 --> 19:33.631
girl I go out with

19:33.673 --> 19:35.591
has something wrong with her?

19:35.633 --> 19:37.802

19:37.844 --> 19:38.928
Maybe it's fate.

How could it be me?

19:42.306 --> 19:43.724
Danny, you're making yourself

19:43.766 --> 19:45.225
nuts looking for

19:43.766 --> 19:45.225
the perfect woman.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.937
There's no such thing

19:45.267 --> 19:47.937
as the perfect woman.

19:47.979 --> 19:50.982
Yes, there is.

19:47.979 --> 19:50.982
I was married to her.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.984
Hey, Pam was my sister.

19:53.026 --> 19:55.111
And I loved her very very much.

19:55.153 --> 19:56.821
But come on, man.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.197
She was always late.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.616
She spent way too much

19:58.238 --> 20:00.616
time in the bathroom.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.035
When I was little,

20:00.658 --> 20:02.035
she used to hold me down

20:02.076 --> 20:04.620
and stick carrots up my nose.

20:04.662 --> 20:06.747
Trust me, she wasn't perfect.

20:06.789 --> 20:09.792
Danny, she seemed perfect

20:06.789 --> 20:09.792
to you because you loved her.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.044
And the bottom line here is that

you're afraid to get

20:11.085 --> 20:12.879

for what's right in people.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.224

Am I in the right apartment?

Yes, Danny. Believe it or not,
