In New York City's war on crime,

00:05.070 --> 00:08.016
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:08.016 --> 00:10.021
of the Major Case Squad.

00:10.021 --> 00:12.155
These are their stories.

00:14.878 --> 00:18.805

00:39.365 --> 00:40.780
I'm new. I'm afraid l...

00:40.780 --> 00:43.322
Relax. Nobody's watching.

00:43.322 --> 00:45.019
I don't think l... / Don't.

00:45.019 --> 00:48.078
Don't think.
Just follow my lead.

00:51.121 --> 00:53.876
There, you see.
You're very good.

00:53.876 --> 00:54.959
I'm not.

00:54.959 --> 00:57.462
Trust me. You're perfect.

01:02.675 --> 01:04.471
We're in business.

01:05.885 --> 01:08.058
It's tailor-made.

01:08.058 --> 01:09.848
I'm kind of backed up.

01:10.097 --> 01:11.186
Uh-huh.

01:12.146 --> 01:14.192
Hey, you know,
about what you said last night

01:14.192 --> 01:17.483
you put your neck out,
you deserve a bigger cut.

01:17.483 --> 01:19.608
Unless, you're still backed up.

01:19.608 --> 01:23.776
No. Well, I'll work it out.

01:24.572 --> 01:26.701
To playing hooky.

01:29.077 --> 01:31.162
If anybody knew we were here...

01:31.162 --> 01:32.915
Don't tell 'em.

01:33.163 --> 01:36.543
Oh, some green tea, please,
and an ashtray.

01:36.543 --> 01:38.711
I'm sorry, sir.
You have to smoke outside.

01:38.711 --> 01:40.538
Bloomberg rules.

01:41.924 --> 01:43.466
Come with?

01:46.387 --> 01:47.848
I didn't know you smoked.

01:47.848 --> 01:50.139
I don't. We're cutting out.

01:50.139 --> 01:51.683
What? You're not serious.

01:51.683 --> 01:54.522
Serious as cancer.

02:04.487 --> 02:06.655
Let me get a hot chocolate.

02:15.203 --> 02:18.456
This one. / Oh.

02:19.670 --> 02:21.503
It's, um...

02:22.762 --> 02:26.468
Oh, it's too expensive.
I can't let you buy this for me.

02:26.468 --> 02:30.305
- I wasn't going to.
- Well...

02:30.968 --> 02:33.516
Oh, Donny. No, I can't.

02:33.516 --> 02:38.107
You can do anything.
Just follow me.

02:43.407 --> 02:46.156
Please, just do what the note says.

03:00.669 --> 03:01.918
Police.! Freeze.!

03:01.918 --> 03:03.132
Hands up now.!

03:03.132 --> 03:04.341
Don't shoot!

03:04.341 --> 03:06.089
- They got me wired!
- Step out!

03:06.089 --> 03:07.174
Keep your hands up!

03:07.174 --> 03:10.721
Please, help me.
They put a timer on me.

03:11.384 --> 03:13.559
They said they'd...

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2004/02/15

04:07.566 --> 04:09.359
He shows the device.
Goes,

04:09.359 --> 04:11.072
"Don't shoot. They wired me."

04:11.072 --> 04:13.778
- Then he blows.
- Anyone else hurt?

04:13.778 --> 04:15.995
No. And we were close.

04:15.995 --> 04:18.289
No keys, no wallet, no phone.

04:18.289 --> 04:20.120
You guys track him from the bank?

04:20.120 --> 04:22.417
We were on regular patrol
when we got the call.

04:22.417 --> 04:25.627
- Saw him hop down those stairs.
- He hopped down?

04:25.627 --> 04:27.046
Right. Then he headed over here.

04:27.046 --> 04:28.674
Anybody in the coffee shop know him?

04:28.674 --> 04:31.468
Not that they remember.
Here's his note.

04:33.887 --> 04:37.557
"There's a bomb. Put the money
in the bag. No dye packets."

04:37.557 --> 04:39.976
- It fits a coercion scenario.
- And the M.O.

04:39.976 --> 04:42.149
Of three other bank jobs
in the last six weeks:

04:42.149 --> 04:45.191
Male perp claiming somebody
wired him with a bomb.

04:45.191 --> 04:46.902
Looks like this one had a day job.

04:46.902 --> 04:48.945
Shoes are creased.

04:48.945 --> 04:52.196
His pant knees are shiny from kneeling.

04:52.196 --> 04:53.364
And his forearms.

04:53.364 --> 04:55.205
Looks like old burn scars.

04:55.205 --> 05:00.747
His fingers, stained with, uh, ink.

05:01.829 --> 05:04.376
Maybe a copy repairman?

05:06.376 --> 05:08.381
Citrus.

05:12.302 --> 05:14.425
Some kind of solvent.

05:14.969 --> 05:17.013
He was probably on the job this morning.

05:17.013 --> 05:20.073
So where's his repair case?

05:27.024 --> 05:28.234
He'd need a stash,

05:28.234 --> 05:31.320
maybe change back into his street clothes,
head out that way.

05:31.320 --> 05:32.560
Excuse me.

05:32.713 --> 05:35.092
Uh, bathroom key, please.

05:49.505 --> 05:53.389
- I'm gonna get the bomb guys.
- There's an I.D. Tag on the handle.

05:54.259 --> 05:56.092
It's B&C Copier Systems.

05:56.092 --> 05:58.514
Ernie Dominguez.

05:58.722 --> 06:01.264
It's so nice to be back.

06:02.564 --> 06:04.766
Apartment Of Ernie Dominguez
371 11th Avenue
Tuesday, January 6

06:04.766 --> 06:07.517
Racing forms, O.T.B. Chits.

06:07.517 --> 06:10.065
Bets on long shots.

06:10.065 --> 06:11.820
No wonder why he had to rob banks.

06:11.820 --> 06:14.444
Four black pants, four white shirts.

06:14.444 --> 06:17.163
Three ties... clip-ons.

06:17.163 --> 06:19.993
In case they get caught
in the rollers of the copier.

06:20.827 --> 06:21.871
He's careful.

06:21.871 --> 06:24.446
He should have worn a clip-on bomb.

06:29.628 --> 06:31.963
It's an insurance policy.

06:33.307 --> 06:36.468
One month ago... 50,000.

06:36.468 --> 06:40.472
Beneficiaries... Angel Dominguez.

06:40.472 --> 06:42.055
- His wife.
- Oh, ex-wife.

06:42.055 --> 06:45.519
Unless this is your idea of
a woman's touch.

06:48.106 --> 06:49.438
Bingo.

06:50.481 --> 06:53.027
Ernie's our bomb maker.

06:56.112 --> 06:57.780
In case he gets caught.

06:57.780 --> 07:01.200
Doesn't wanna go to jail,
so he straps on a live bomb.

07:01.200 --> 07:04.745
Pretends somebody made him do it
so his wife can collect the insurance.

07:04.745 --> 07:07.070
He's very considerate.

07:08.082 --> 07:10.878
He packed black powder
into a used ink cartridge.

07:10.878 --> 07:12.795
He recycles.
What a good boy.

07:12.795 --> 07:16.047
Put the cartridge in here with
the open side against his chest.

07:16.047 --> 07:18.095
To limit the field of damage.

07:18.095 --> 07:21.719
The timer was preset for 20 minutes.
That's what set off the device.

07:21.719 --> 07:23.557
He set the timer.

07:23.557 --> 07:26.935
He had 20 minutes to get to the coffee shop.

07:26.935 --> 07:30.023
Ah, he would have made it
if he hadn't been stopped.

07:30.732 --> 07:36.193
He was playing Russian roulette
with a bomb instead of a gun.

07:36.524 --> 07:39.487
There's... There's no way
my husband did this to himself.

07:39.487 --> 07:41.281
Somebody must have forced him.

07:41.281 --> 07:43.119
Your ex-husband, right?

07:43.119 --> 07:45.919
We still cared about each other.

07:45.919 --> 07:49.501
He was always all happy.
How could somebody do this to him?

07:49.501 --> 07:52.167
The ring. You remarried?

07:52.377 --> 07:53.833
Engaged.

07:53.833 --> 07:59.010
That had to be tough on Ernie.
Did he get all depressed?

07:59.010 --> 08:02.476
No, no, no.
He wouldn't suicide himself.

08:02.476 --> 08:04.838
He was so happy always.

08:05.305 --> 08:08.351
Someone tell you that if Ernie suicided,

08:08.351 --> 08:11.898
you can't collect on the insurance?

08:12.226 --> 08:15.192
Why shouldn't I get the money?
I never got nothing from Ernie.

08:15.192 --> 08:18.872
What'd you get from your fiance?

08:18.872 --> 08:21.617
Those scars around your eye?

08:23.955 --> 08:26.326
That was a car accident.

08:29.288 --> 08:32.876
Frank was a little drunk.
He ran into a parked car.

08:34.208 --> 08:36.462
And you got bills.

08:36.462 --> 08:39.422
Frank's gotta pay restitution.

08:39.422 --> 08:41.217
And Ernie knew?

08:41.924 --> 08:43.552
Yeah.

08:44.179 --> 08:46.977
Someone else must have bought
the insurance in Ernie's name.

08:46.977 --> 08:49.393
Someone who didn't know the money
was gonna go to Angel's fiance.

08:49.393 --> 08:51.393
Maybe an accomplice.
If Ernie got killed,

08:51.393 --> 08:55.974
we'd find the policy and think Ernie
was acting alone... case closed.

08:59.192 --> 09:01.862
The jury just came in.
Harland's over there.

09:02.030 --> 09:05.282
I hope Nicole likes the scones
at Bedford Prison.

09:05.282 --> 09:06.533
Okay. Thanks.

09:10.079 --> 09:13.083
Not guilty on all counts.

09:15.417 --> 09:18.380
She's got her husband's money to thank.

09:18.380 --> 09:21.424
- That's too easy.
- These came in.

09:23.051 --> 09:26.474
The other bomb jobs.
Tapes and photos on the way.

09:28.138 --> 09:30.557
Is that Ernie? / Yeah.

09:30.557 --> 09:33.976
He enters the bank from the lobby.

09:34.939 --> 09:36.482
Watch his hands.

09:37.522 --> 09:40.484
- He's playing with his watch.
- The people behind him,

09:40.484 --> 09:43.200
they're adjusting their belts,
fixing their watches.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.535
Metal detector?
Just to get into a bank?

09:46.535 --> 09:50.911
Or into the building the bank's in.

09:51.453 --> 09:53.621
Ernie hit this bank three weeks ago.

09:53.621 --> 09:56.837
It's in the same building that
houses the Israeli bond office.

09:56.837 --> 09:59.339
To get in the lobby, you have to
go through a metal detector,

09:59.339 --> 10:00.839
which Ernie did.

10:00.839 --> 10:03.674
And the bomb that killed him
had metal plates, wires.

10:03.674 --> 10:07.553
If he was wearing it here,
it would have set off the detector.

10:07.553 --> 10:09.097
So this bomb here was a fake.

10:09.097 --> 10:11.934
Yeah. Now, he was seen
hopping down stairs.

10:11.934 --> 10:14.270
That's not the way somebody behaves

10:14.270 --> 10:16.062
when they know they're
wearing a live bomb.

10:16.062 --> 10:17.313
His partner set him up.

10:17.313 --> 10:20.066
Three fake bombs, then a real one.

10:20.066 --> 10:21.775
Then blew him up.

10:22.234 --> 10:26.197
Maybe to get a fresh start,
a new partner.

10:29.990 --> 10:35.540
Please, no alarm. And hurry,
before he blows us all up.

10:45.839 --> 10:48.344
The bank has the same layout
as the ones Ernie hit.

10:48.344 --> 10:52.976
And it's next door to a coffee shop
with a bathroom with a locking door.

10:53.147 --> 10:56.103
Okay, so it's not a copycat.

10:57.104 --> 11:01.322
Our guy finds people, people like Ernie,
with no priors,

11:01.322 --> 11:03.149
and what, turns them into
John Dillingers?

11:03.149 --> 11:07.195
Yeah, our guy saw potential in Ernie.

11:08.947 --> 11:12.828
Maybe he saw something
in this woman.

11:12.828 --> 11:16.022
Well, it's a good bet the clock's
ticking on her too.

11:16.022 --> 11:17.614
Let's not lose her.

11:19.168 --> 11:21.005
The morning of each robbery,

11:21.005 --> 11:25.426
Ernie's work sheet...had him on
a maintenance call near the target bank.

11:25.426 --> 11:28.433
The calls were booked just four days
in advance.

11:28.433 --> 11:32.845
So Ernie's schedule didn't leave him
enough time to case each bank.

11:32.845 --> 11:35.640
Meaning the partner did it.

11:37.265 --> 11:41.825
We'll need tapes of the four days
before each robbery.

11:46.487 --> 11:48.559
There he is again.

11:52.245 --> 11:55.536
- The same guy.
- He's quick on his feet.

11:55.916 --> 12:00.145
See, he's taking photos of
the tellers with his phone.

12:00.145 --> 12:02.333
It's hard to make out his face.

12:02.333 --> 12:04.397
He knows where the cameras are.

12:04.397 --> 12:07.336
His case is too thin to be a briefcase.

12:07.336 --> 12:10.675
You see the hinges
on the top and the bottom?

12:10.675 --> 12:12.808
It's open on both sides.

12:12.808 --> 12:14.493
It's got four folding panels.

12:14.493 --> 12:16.406
Sample case for a salesman.

12:16.406 --> 12:19.367
Yeah, the samples...
carpeting, flooring.

12:24.173 --> 12:26.531
Or linoleum.

Apartment Of Ernie Dominguez

Monday, January 12

12:29.035 --> 12:31.182
The super said the building
didn't install it,

12:31.182 --> 12:35.643
but if we wreck it,
we have to pay for it.

12:39.780 --> 12:43.508
The material, it's, uh, springy.

12:43.793 --> 12:46.070
Like they use at my gym.

12:46.070 --> 12:47.527
That's what he does.

12:47.527 --> 12:49.062
He sells flooring.
That's how we find him.

12:49.062 --> 12:53.350
Just what I've been dying to do...
shop for a new floor.

12:56.147 --> 12:59.853
This one's on its own private bay.

13:04.368 --> 13:05.939
There they are.

13:08.469 --> 13:11.131
1:11.

13:17.635 --> 13:21.032
They won't stay more than
three minutes. Watch.

13:21.032 --> 13:23.116
Are you gonna be there on Friday?

13:23.116 --> 13:26.395
I'll try. Got a lot left to do.

13:27.301 --> 13:30.002
I've never even been to Mexico.

13:30.002 --> 13:32.977
Let's keep our eyes on the prize.

The Floor Shop

Wednesday, January 14

13:37.035 --> 13:40.614
Gray-black, reversible,
semi-sprung calendered vinyl.

13:40.614 --> 13:42.569
- Very nice.
- Yeah, well, it came with the place.

13:42.569 --> 13:43.982
In the kids' room.

13:43.982 --> 13:46.503
We've been all over town trying to match it.

13:46.503 --> 13:48.524
Next time start with the best.

13:48.524 --> 13:50.531
We just did a big install
of this at Juilliard.

13:50.531 --> 13:52.567
Juilliard. You hear that, honey?

13:52.567 --> 13:54.906
What I hear is our budget going
out the window.

13:54.906 --> 13:57.830
Top-rated flooring is always expensive.

13:57.830 --> 13:59.934
But those big jobs?

13:59.934 --> 14:02.916
Sometimes there's some overage.

14:03.932 --> 14:05.959
Oh, you mean, like it fell out of
a truck or something.

14:05.959 --> 14:09.732
Easy. My boss doesn't need
to hear the details.

14:09.732 --> 14:12.299
Which are, you pay cash,

14:12.299 --> 14:15.675
no invoice, no sales tax.

14:15.845 --> 14:20.753
I mean, it's not like we'd be the first
ones in on a deal like this, right?

14:20.753 --> 14:23.417
Good to know who wears the pants
in the family.

14:23.874 --> 14:26.572
I just wear the badge.

14:30.747 --> 14:33.182
Uh, it's not really no sales tax.

14:33.182 --> 14:34.425
Whatever.

14:34.425 --> 14:36.586
You sell any to this guy?

14:37.329 --> 14:38.937
Johnny?

14:38.937 --> 14:40.135
He's a jobber.

14:40.135 --> 14:42.516
Buys odd lots for resale.

14:42.516 --> 14:44.297
He walked in a couple of months ago.

14:44.297 --> 14:46.539
Said he was looking for some Marley floor.

14:46.539 --> 14:50.080
Marley floor.
That's what he called it?

14:50.080 --> 14:53.206
Uh, that's a dance term, isn't it,
for this type of springy floor?

14:53.206 --> 14:54.490
Th-That's his angle.

14:54.490 --> 14:57.610
He said he goes to dance studios,
takes a couple of lessons,

14:57.610 --> 15:00.003
sells them a new floor.

15:00.277 --> 15:03.084
I have 12 studios.
Have you tried across the street?

15:03.084 --> 15:04.638
We've been everywhere.

15:04.878 --> 15:08.554
He might have tried to sell you a Marley floor.

15:09.073 --> 15:12.124
Oh, Johnny, the floor guy.

15:12.124 --> 15:13.183
Nice man.

15:13.183 --> 15:16.181
He comes in a couple of times
a week to take rumba or tango.

15:16.181 --> 15:17.763
Same time each week?

15:17.763 --> 15:19.619
Anytime between 12:00 and 3:00.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.247
Wednesdays and Fridays usually.

15:21.247 --> 15:23.999
Fridays? Like today.

15:27.206 --> 15:31.448
Okay, everyone.
?????

15:31.780 --> 15:34.040
- May I have the honors?
- Thank you.

15:59.297 --> 16:01.793
Just, um, one dance before you go?

16:01.793 --> 16:04.923
Oh, I'm... I'm supposed to meet someone.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.737
So is everyone.

16:06.737 --> 16:10.226
Who you waiting for,
Prince Charming or Valiant?

16:11.424 --> 16:13.137
Come on. Just until he comes.

16:13.137 --> 16:15.642
I've been looking forward to
dancing all day.

16:18.796 --> 16:20.031
Great.

16:30.357 --> 16:31.621
I'm Robert.

16:31.621 --> 16:34.499
I'm Margie.
Oops, I'm clumsy today.

16:34.499 --> 16:37.157
No, you're doing good, Margie.

16:39.021 --> 16:43.665
I guess you've been coming here
for a while, you and your prince.

16:43.665 --> 16:46.545
I try to take a class or two a week.

16:46.545 --> 16:48.485
I don't have the time.

16:49.512 --> 16:50.361
I'm on the clock.

16:50.361 --> 16:53.250
If my boss found out I was here,
I'd be fired.

16:53.250 --> 16:54.943
Then don't tell him.

16:55.583 --> 16:57.726
You know, you're right.

16:58.262 --> 16:59.414
Here we go.

16:59.842 --> 17:01.083
Ooh. Ooh.

17:02.390 --> 17:05.040
Oh, don't make me dizzy.

17:05.556 --> 17:07.317
Is it dizzier than
when you dance with your friend?

17:07.317 --> 17:10.300
It's all I can do to follow his lead.

17:10.300 --> 17:11.540
It's not so hard.

17:11.540 --> 17:12.702
You just do what he does.

17:12.702 --> 17:15.551
Yeah, and backwards and in high heels.

17:20.708 --> 17:23.720
I'm jealous of your prince.

17:23.720 --> 17:25.431
Well, tell me his name?

17:25.431 --> 17:28.574
At least I should know
who my competition is.

17:31.313 --> 17:36.060
Ah, whatever his name is,
he's a lucky man.

17:36.060 --> 17:37.968
Another dance. Come on.

17:37.968 --> 17:42.024
- Or a coffee?
- Um, I'd... I'd better go.

17:42.024 --> 17:44.699
Oh, well, thank you, Margie.

17:50.075 --> 17:51.554
Well, it's her.

17:51.554 --> 17:53.989
Right height, right build.

17:54.652 --> 17:57.440
And she follows you wherever you lead her.

17:58.107 --> 18:01.859
That would be what Johnny liked best.

18:04.177 --> 18:05.847
Ms. Marjorie Timmons.

18:05.847 --> 18:10.215
Two kids and a husband who got home
at 8:00 from his job in Connecticut.

18:10.215 --> 18:13.049
Where does she find time to rob banks?

18:13.049 --> 18:15.090
The Kiddie Gym said she used to
drop her kid off

18:15.090 --> 18:16.522
Monday and Wednesday mornings.

18:16.522 --> 18:19.767
Then a month ago, she switched to
Wednesday and Friday afternoons.

18:19.767 --> 18:25.714
Which gives her enough time to meet
the Marley floor man at a class or a bank.

18:25.714 --> 18:27.352
This woman has no record?

18:27.352 --> 18:29.319
Just a half dozen parking tickets.

18:29.319 --> 18:32.440
No one upstairs is buying
"the soccer mom bandit" angle.

18:32.440 --> 18:33.540
I need something solid.

18:33.540 --> 18:35.316
Well, we don't have anything solid.

18:35.316 --> 18:37.160
Just the way she dodged my small talk.

18:37.160 --> 18:41.660
The way she tensed up
when I mentioned her partner.

18:42.629 --> 18:47.301
The way she, uh, you know,
followed my lead when we danced.

18:48.374 --> 18:53.074
Detectives,
I'm sorry about Nicole Wallace.

18:53.074 --> 18:57.254
But l-I'd hate to see us compensate
by hounding an innocent woman.

18:57.254 --> 19:01.720
We are not hounding Marjorie Timmons.

19:02.282 --> 19:04.621
You know, we're trying to save her life.

19:04.621 --> 19:08.757
Bring me probable cause and
I will try with you.

19:15.842 --> 19:19.459
You know I'm good for the ride, Bobby,
but I saw her,

19:19.459 --> 19:22.197
and I'm not sure either.

19:26.110 --> 19:31.181
Her parking tickets,
four Mondays in a row last month.

19:31.181 --> 19:34.067
She used to drop her kid off at 
the Kiddie Gym on Monday mornings.

19:34.067 --> 19:35.962
In Madison.

19:35.962 --> 19:39.507
These tickets are all
on the same street in Fort Lee.

19:39.507 --> 19:42.899
Well, maybe that's
where the Marley floor gets laid.

19:43.190 --> 19:45.346
U Can Paint!
Fort Lee, New Jersey
Monday, January 19

19:45.346 --> 19:47.232
Um, Margie.

19:47.232 --> 19:50.058
Sure. She used to take
the Monday class.

19:50.734 --> 19:52.359
- Is she all right?
- She's fine.

19:52.359 --> 19:55.579
She collected a bunch of parking
tickets outside your studio.

19:55.579 --> 19:57.869
Well, I hope she thought it was worth it.

19:57.869 --> 20:02.722
No, see, your class ended at 11:00,
and she was ticketed around 11:30.

20:02.722 --> 20:06.678
Okay. Maybe I encouraged her
to stay behind.

20:06.678 --> 20:08.218
But nothing happened.

20:08.218 --> 20:11.614
She was like a statue waiting
to be brought to life.

20:11.614 --> 20:13.792
Did she leave any of her paintings behind?

20:13.792 --> 20:15.870
She left them all here.

20:16.420 --> 20:20.326
Probably because she
never finished any of them.

20:23.775 --> 20:25.776
This is interesting.

20:25.966 --> 20:30.704
The bag, it's... it's almost fauvist.

20:30.704 --> 20:32.363
- Your suggestion?
- No.

20:32.363 --> 20:35.200
That's the bag she carries everywhere.

20:35.846 --> 20:40.582
Looks like she gave up the bag
in the painting for this one.

20:41.398 --> 20:44.474
Looks like you'd practically have
to rob a bank to afford it.

20:44.474 --> 20:47.934
Depending how she got it,
might give us probable cause.

20:48.847 --> 20:50.933
B&C Equities Stamford, Connecticut
Tuesday, January 20

20:50.933 --> 20:52.906
Uh, a handbag?

20:52.906 --> 20:57.121
My-My wife just has the same purse
she's always had for years.

20:57.121 --> 21:00.513
This would be a newer bag
tan leather with gold trim,

21:00.513 --> 21:02.812
made by Malespeina.

21:03.865 --> 21:06.022
No, l-I've never seen this.

21:06.022 --> 21:07.272
Why are you asking?

21:07.272 --> 21:10.393
Your license plate came up
in our surveillance

21:10.393 --> 21:13.508
of a stolen designer goods ring.

21:15.213 --> 21:18.704
Marg... Margie wouldn't buy stolen things.

21:18.704 --> 21:23.015
The person who sold it to her said
they met her at a dance class.

21:23.772 --> 21:25.190
Dance class?

21:25.190 --> 21:26.725
Uh, Margie doesn't dance.

21:26.725 --> 21:28.648
Yeah, Midtown.

21:28.648 --> 21:30.624
Wednesday, Fridays.

21:30.624 --> 21:34.463
L... And I don't know what
you're imagining about Margie,

21:34.463 --> 21:38.012
but, you know, she was a high school
chemistry teacher, for God's sake.

21:38.012 --> 21:40.640
- Our mistake.
- Yeah.

21:42.617 --> 21:44.848
Not that Malespeina bag.

21:44.848 --> 21:46.623
You found it?

21:46.815 --> 21:48.487
It was stolen.

21:48.487 --> 21:50.903
We filed a report three weeks ago.

21:50.903 --> 21:52.620
Do you recognize them?

21:52.620 --> 21:54.499
Yes.

21:55.403 --> 21:57.499
It's never the ones you think.

21:57.499 --> 21:58.984
Y-You watched them?

21:58.984 --> 22:02.272
You saw how they acted together?

22:02.618 --> 22:04.932
He seemed to be calling the shots.

22:04.932 --> 22:06.339
She didn't seem to mind.

22:06.339 --> 22:08.172
Calling the shots.

22:08.172 --> 22:09.210
He picked out the bag.

22:09.210 --> 22:10.750
And made her try it on.

22:10.750 --> 22:12.968
And then I had to answer the phone.

22:12.968 --> 22:14.767
Excuse us.
They hit another bank.

22:14.767 --> 22:19.471
Female, white, dark wig, sunglasses,
bomb strapped to her chest.

22:20.048 --> 22:21.865
I don't know where Margie is.

22:21.865 --> 22:23.032
L-I got a call at work.

22:23.032 --> 22:24.668
She didn't show to pick up Phoenix
at Kiddie Gym.

22:24.668 --> 22:26.919
- Your wife's dresser?
- Ri-Right here.

22:26.919 --> 22:29.731
I tried her on her cell,
but no answer.

22:30.245 --> 22:33.673
Did you tell her about the conversation
we had last night?

22:34.519 --> 22:37.364
Hey, why don't you go and
watch videos with your brother, okay?

22:39.407 --> 22:41.145
I just asked her about the bag.

22:41.145 --> 22:43.931
She told me she got it at a church sale.

22:44.493 --> 22:46.859
Are... Are you gonna tell me
what's happened to Margie?

22:46.859 --> 22:48.608
We're not sure.

22:50.789 --> 22:52.313
She always keep the closet this neat?

22:52.313 --> 22:54.866
Yeah, she's compulsive about it.

22:55.841 --> 22:58.581
Hey, th-that's not how it's supposed to be.

22:58.581 --> 23:00.057
This drawer is empty.

23:00.057 --> 23:01.779
Does your wife have an overnight bag?

23:01.779 --> 23:03.563
Yeah, it's up on the shelf.

23:04.906 --> 23:06.558
Oh, God.

23:10.342 --> 23:12.716
This was in the bottom drawer.

23:12.716 --> 23:15.399
Sketchbook and these.

23:15.399 --> 23:17.182
You planning a trip to Mexico?

23:17.182 --> 23:21.992
No. I mean, Margie used to talk about it,
but we can't afford it.

23:22.189 --> 23:24.469
What is happening?

23:24.794 --> 23:27.815
We're gonna need to look in your car.

23:28.807 --> 23:30.999
She's running away with him.

23:30.999 --> 23:34.303
That doesn't sound like Johnny's M.O.

23:39.264 --> 23:40.658
Dollar coins.

23:40.658 --> 23:43.415
There must be $50, $60 in here.

23:43.415 --> 23:45.022
Mr. Timmons,

23:45.022 --> 23:48.291
do you or Margie ever play
video poker or slot machines?

23:48.291 --> 23:51.404
What, you mean gamble? No.

23:51.404 --> 23:54.125
Your kids ever have a cat back here?

23:54.125 --> 23:56.044
What? A cat? No.

23:56.972 --> 23:59.305
Smells like ammonia.

23:59.305 --> 24:03.262
It smells strongest over here.

24:15.224 --> 24:18.079
It's ammonia and calcium carbide.

24:20.476 --> 24:26.737
He used this to make silver acetylide.
It's a primary explosive.

24:28.119 --> 24:31.697
He planted this here and the coins...

24:31.697 --> 24:33.782
to, uh, tell us a story.

24:33.782 --> 24:36.568
The bomb-building bank robber
with a gambling problem.

24:36.568 --> 24:39.361
- Same plot as Ernie.
- Only Margie gave it a twist.

24:39.361 --> 24:42.843
She packed her bags and left her husband.

24:47.771 --> 24:50.106
She wasn't supposed to do that.

24:50.106 --> 24:52.778
And we weren't supposed to find this stuff

24:52.778 --> 24:54.523
until after the next job.

24:54.523 --> 24:57.218
The job that ends with a bang.

25:02.138 --> 25:03.808
All these sketches, they tell a story.

25:03.808 --> 25:08.181
She draws a picture of her daughter.
She leaves the face blank.

25:08.181 --> 25:12.093
A landscape, it's mostly clouds.

25:12.093 --> 25:14.626
She's depressed.

25:14.626 --> 25:17.981
Numb, you know.
She wants to feel something.

25:18.264 --> 25:22.033
You know, these sketches
at the end of the book here...

25:23.578 --> 25:28.345
a man's hand around a mug,
salt and pepper shaker, napkin holder.

25:28.345 --> 25:29.912
From a coffee shop.

25:29.912 --> 25:33.983
And this letter "F," followed by
these numbers... 1/11, 1/15, 2/37.

25:33.983 --> 25:36.997
- These could be times.
- "F" could be Friday.

25:36.997 --> 25:41.888
These could be scheduled deliveries,
armored car deliveries.

25:41.888 --> 25:44.810
He'd wanna hit the bank after they leave.

25:44.810 --> 25:48.153
We've got till Friday to match
a bank to those numbers.

25:49.221 --> 25:51.486
The Sandwich Store
52 West 51st Street
Friday, January 23

25:51.486 --> 25:54.937
Yeah, sure, the, uh, sketchbook.
She was here.

25:54.937 --> 25:56.907
She was a decaf latte.

25:56.907 --> 25:59.719
He was a Chai tea with soy.
They were here together last week.

25:59.719 --> 26:03.388
And then he was here a couple of
days ago and sat by the window.

26:03.388 --> 26:06.373
The Chai with the soy,
he ask for the bathroom key?

26:06.373 --> 26:08.770
Mm, yeah. A lot.

26:10.877 --> 26:12.514
Margie could put her disguise on in here,

26:12.514 --> 26:15.983
but this is too small to stash her
street clothes in.

26:15.983 --> 26:19.375
Uh, this tile here is loose
from its bracket.

26:26.527 --> 26:28.669
Well, there's plenty of room up here.

26:29.305 --> 26:32.813
We need to post teams at other
restaurants in the area, just in case.

26:32.813 --> 26:36.982
Now we need to intercept her
before she straps on that bomb.

26:40.378 --> 26:42.546
There goes the last delivery.

26:42.546 --> 26:44.359
Bank closes in 20 minutes.

26:44.359 --> 26:45.488
If they were gonna make their move,

26:45.488 --> 26:49.400
Margie'd be in the john changing
her clothes by now.

26:58.840 --> 27:03.584
Clothing store.
Changing rooms.

27:04.173 --> 27:05.866
You get the bank.

27:24.260 --> 27:25.877
Margie?

27:25.877 --> 27:28.411
Donny, is that you?

27:36.389 --> 27:40.295
- No, no, let me go.
- No, you stop it. It's over.

27:40.762 --> 27:42.310
Where is he, Margie?

27:42.310 --> 27:45.259
It's not real.
It was never real.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.000
Police.!
Put your hands up.!

27:54.569 --> 27:56.437
- I didn't do anything.
- Put the case down.

27:56.437 --> 27:59.610
And take your hand out of your pocket now.

28:01.139 --> 28:03.271
Good boy.
Now the other hand.

28:03.271 --> 28:06.009
- I have something for you.
- Let it go.

28:06.757 --> 28:09.031
- I said let it go!
- Donny.!

28:09.031 --> 28:11.181
We've got Margie.

28:11.636 --> 28:12.650
Gun.!

28:13.975 --> 28:16.654
- Move in. Go! Go!
- Take his hands!

28:22.307 --> 28:23.444
A starter's pistol.

28:23.444 --> 28:27.431
I was gonna shoot him over a starter's
pistol. / Hey, are you okay?

28:29.361 --> 28:32.909
What are they doing here?
They weren't on the schedule.

28:35.767 --> 28:39.944
Maybe not on a bank schedule,
but the O.T.B.'s.

28:39.944 --> 28:42.684
Great. More guys with guns.

28:44.132 --> 28:46.036
Well, I told you it wasn't real.

28:46.036 --> 28:48.699
It's Play-Doh.
I made it myself.

28:48.699 --> 28:51.475
I, uh, saw that other guy on the news,

28:51.475 --> 28:54.179
and I thought, "How hard is that?"

28:55.074 --> 28:59.603
Margie, we know that you had an accomplice.

28:59.603 --> 29:01.313
You called me by his name... Donny.

29:01.313 --> 29:03.231
No, no, no. He's just a friend.

29:03.231 --> 29:06.819
We took a dance class, and then
he walked me to the clothing store.

29:06.819 --> 29:08.848
He has nothing to do with this.

29:08.848 --> 29:10.034
Are you in love with him?

29:10.034 --> 29:11.268
L...

29:11.268 --> 29:12.806
Well, l-I don't know.

29:12.806 --> 29:17.274
I care about him.
We care about each other.

29:17.516 --> 29:20.155
Left your husband to be with him.

29:21.870 --> 29:25.142
You, uh, wanted to...

29:25.142 --> 29:27.591
run away with him.

29:28.589 --> 29:31.574
That's between me and my husband.

29:33.982 --> 29:35.712
Margie,

29:38.030 --> 29:42.974
let me, uh, show you what this man is like.

29:42.974 --> 29:44.951
This man who's become your lover.

29:44.951 --> 29:47.906
No, we are... Donny is a gentleman.

29:47.906 --> 29:49.548
We're not lovers.

29:49.548 --> 29:51.582
And I believe you.

29:53.945 --> 29:55.778
Now here.

29:56.897 --> 30:00.371
It's Donald DePalma. Right?

30:01.212 --> 30:04.192
He's been in prison five times...

30:04.192 --> 30:05.546
for bank robbery.

30:05.546 --> 30:08.562
He always works with a partner.

30:08.895 --> 30:13.050
You know, the first time that
he danced with you,

30:14.333 --> 30:19.201
he saw how numb you felt inside.

30:20.422 --> 30:23.798
That you were ready to try anything.

30:24.125 --> 30:26.589
The handbag that he helped
you steal, that was a test.

30:26.589 --> 30:30.540
Mm-mmm. You're wrong about Donny.

30:37.084 --> 30:38.163
You were a chemistry teacher.

30:38.163 --> 30:42.590
Now, what can you make with these things?

30:42.590 --> 30:45.804
We found these in your minivan.

30:46.480 --> 30:49.094
Yeah, he put them there.

30:49.094 --> 30:52.382
So that when he switched the
Play-Doh with the real thing...

30:52.382 --> 30:56.204
and blew you up,

30:57.916 --> 31:02.437
everyone would think that
you made the bomb yourself.

31:04.717 --> 31:07.084
No. This is all lies.

31:07.084 --> 31:09.380
You put these things in my car.

31:09.380 --> 31:11.474
Margie, come on.

31:11.720 --> 31:13.929
Don't throw your life away for this guy.

31:13.929 --> 31:15.979
No, Donny didn't do it.

31:15.979 --> 31:18.236
I did. L-I planned everything.

31:18.236 --> 31:20.352
Uh, everything. Like today.

31:20.352 --> 31:23.542
Waiting until closing time to hit the bank?

31:23.542 --> 31:25.929
Huh? When the place was filled?
That was your bright idea?

31:25.929 --> 31:30.922
But there was an armored car,
and I had to wait for them to leave.

31:32.352 --> 31:36.463
Well, then you could have gone in earlier.

31:36.463 --> 31:41.482
L-I was going to, but then
Donny was late for our dance class,

31:41.482 --> 31:44.228
so I had to change my plans.

31:45.292 --> 31:48.952
Ms. Timmons, this is Ms. Shapiro.
She's your attorney.

31:48.952 --> 31:50.718
I didn't ask for a lawyer.

31:50.718 --> 31:53.237
Your husband hired me.

31:53.237 --> 31:55.960
- My client's done talking.
- Breaking news, counselor.

31:55.960 --> 32:01.002
She's admitted sole responsibility
for two bank robberies.

32:02.776 --> 32:05.595
I was just trying to get
my hand out of my pocket.

32:05.595 --> 32:07.547
I wasn't gonna do anything stupid.

32:07.547 --> 32:10.048
I carry the thing because...
for protection.

32:10.048 --> 32:12.905
- I work in a lot of bad neighborhoods.
- That's funny.

32:12.905 --> 32:15.220
You're outside a bank with a fake gun.

32:15.220 --> 32:18.529
Margie's across the street
with a fake bomb.

32:18.529 --> 32:21.628
A-A bomb? Margie?

32:21.628 --> 32:22.893
Come on.

32:23.904 --> 32:26.534
Look. Margie and I have been
having an affair.

32:26.534 --> 32:28.730
Th-That's all. Okay?

32:29.392 --> 32:31.551
Now can I go to the john?

32:31.551 --> 32:33.285
Don't fall in.

32:38.706 --> 32:41.234
The Play-Doh bomb.

32:41.234 --> 32:43.923
Looks like you've been thrown
a curve, Detective.

32:43.923 --> 32:46.298
Look. He planned on killing her.

32:46.298 --> 32:49.523
He would have no other reason to
put the chemicals in her car.

32:49.523 --> 32:51.703
Maybe he changed his mind...

32:51.703 --> 32:53.755
after she left her husband.

32:53.755 --> 32:57.849
I guess up until Ernie's death,
he never had a history of violence.

32:57.849 --> 32:59.714
Never used a weapon.
Never hurt anyone.

32:59.714 --> 33:03.341
Now all of a sudden, he's strapping
live explosives on his partners.

33:03.341 --> 33:07.170
All those hours they spent
staking out the bank,

33:07.170 --> 33:09.026
you know, making notes
on the armored car deliveries,

33:09.026 --> 33:13.389
then he almost walks her into
the delivery at the O.T.B.

33:13.389 --> 33:15.655
And tries to pull a starter's pistol on me.

33:15.655 --> 33:17.101
Now, he said that they had an affair,

33:17.101 --> 33:20.631
but she denies that they were ever lovers.

33:21.188 --> 33:22.468
She calls him a gentleman.

33:22.468 --> 33:25.465
All the trips to the john,
the soy milk, the green tea.

33:25.465 --> 33:28.227
The insurance he took out for Ernie.

33:28.227 --> 33:32.979
He would have had to submit
a blood sample when he applied.

33:32.979 --> 33:35.090
He would have used his own blood.

33:35.090 --> 33:37.029
What are you suspecting?

33:37.029 --> 33:39.281
Uh, well, we thought...

33:39.281 --> 33:41.744
Ernie was suicidal.

33:41.744 --> 33:44.869
Right pathology, wrong man.

33:47.877 --> 33:50.857
He must have got lost on a doughnut run.

33:51.553 --> 33:52.769
I heard that.

33:55.659 --> 34:00.016
Actually, we were just getting
a statement from your girlfriend.

34:00.387 --> 34:04.770
Now we just need to check
a few things with you.

34:04.770 --> 34:07.513
And then, well,

34:09.237 --> 34:11.690
we'll do that doughnut run.

34:12.545 --> 34:15.333
My client's not gonna respond
to a statement he hasn't seen.

34:15.333 --> 34:17.612
He doesn't have to respond.

34:19.860 --> 34:24.556
Did you ever see these in her car?

34:28.570 --> 34:30.562
No.

34:31.875 --> 34:33.933
Do you know what they are?

34:37.053 --> 34:39.735
I can read labels.

34:40.790 --> 34:44.757
- How 'bout what they're for?
- Ammonia?

34:45.502 --> 34:48.147
Cleaning pools.

34:50.183 --> 34:52.322
Not this stuff.

34:53.799 --> 34:57.834
That's why there's a skull and
bones on the label.

34:58.161 --> 35:02.407
She has a perfectly serviceable
30-something husband at home,

35:02.407 --> 35:09.996
and you're, what, 55?

35:11.392 --> 35:14.177
I'm more than just serviceable.

35:14.177 --> 35:16.808
You know how to...

35:16.808 --> 35:22.578
unlock those, uh, pent-up
suburban passions.

35:22.578 --> 35:28.238
I helped Margie rediscover
parts of herself.

35:31.799 --> 35:33.910
Okay.

35:34.758 --> 35:38.386
Just, uh, gimme a minute.

35:42.835 --> 35:46.045
Did you hear what he said, Margie?

35:46.731 --> 35:49.664
Is that what you mean by a gentleman?

35:49.664 --> 35:52.846
I don't know why he said that.
We never...

35:52.846 --> 35:55.675
We were never intimate.

35:55.675 --> 35:57.887
It just didn't matter.

35:58.115 --> 36:03.536
I mean, why would he need to lie about it?

36:03.536 --> 36:06.337
What's he hiding?

36:09.524 --> 36:12.628
Wouldn't you like to ask him?

36:16.158 --> 36:20.028
Margie. Are you all right?

36:20.028 --> 36:24.139
I mean, they told me some cockamamy
story about a bomb.

36:24.139 --> 36:25.939
You should hear the one she told us,

36:25.939 --> 36:27.932
about the soccer mom bandit,

36:27.932 --> 36:33.572
who robs banks and makes her getaway
in a minivan with a baby seat.

36:33.572 --> 36:36.529
I didn't tell you because
I didn't want to involve you.

36:36.529 --> 36:38.530
But he was involved.

36:38.998 --> 36:40.017
No, I wasn't.

36:40.017 --> 36:42.609
Oh, sure you were.

36:42.609 --> 36:44.504
Uh, if you hadn't...

36:44.504 --> 36:46.954
How'd you put it? Um...

36:47.948 --> 36:52.043
helped her rediscover parts of
herself, well, then,

36:52.043 --> 36:56.452
she wouldn't have had the confidence
to pull it off.

36:56.452 --> 36:58.253
I just offered her my friendship.

36:58.253 --> 37:00.044
Friendship.

37:00.289 --> 37:03.680
Y-You mean, um, a-a new life,

37:03.680 --> 37:06.631
the moment that you took her
into your arms.

37:06.631 --> 37:10.068
You know, I'd like to see
how you did that.

37:10.068 --> 37:12.045
Can you show me?

37:12.045 --> 37:14.904
- Get outta here.
- No, come on, show me.

37:17.178 --> 37:20.575
L-I wanna learn your dance technique.

37:20.575 --> 37:21.964
S-So you took her hand,

37:21.964 --> 37:24.853
and what'd you do with it?
You held her hand, right?

37:24.853 --> 37:26.719
Her palm snug in yours, right?

37:26.719 --> 37:30.325
And then what?
What did you do?

37:30.325 --> 37:33.169
Did you put it against
the small ofher back? Huh?

37:33.169 --> 37:34.898
You hold her tight against you?

37:34.898 --> 37:36.646
Quit it. / Tighter?

37:36.646 --> 37:39.346
So she could feel your life
flowing into her?

37:39.346 --> 37:40.785
Filling her up.

37:40.785 --> 37:42.737
Except it wasn't life.

37:42.737 --> 37:44.429
Was it, Donny?

37:45.080 --> 37:48.020
It was sickness. Hmm?

37:48.020 --> 37:51.311
Come on. Your sickness, right?

37:53.082 --> 37:56.512
This dance, was it a dance of death?

37:56.512 --> 37:58.575
Get away from me!

37:59.052 --> 38:00.403
You don't know
what you're talking about.

38:00.403 --> 38:03.017
Blood doesn't lie, Donny.

38:03.017 --> 38:06.200
The sample you gave when
you got Ernie's insurance,

38:06.200 --> 38:10.214
they found high levels of
prostate-specific antigen.

38:10.214 --> 38:12.388
In a young guy, that might mean
he just had sex,

38:12.388 --> 38:15.357
or he has extra testosterone.

38:15.357 --> 38:17.094
A man...

38:17.817 --> 38:20.792
Donny's age...

38:20.792 --> 38:22.392
usually means one thing.

38:22.392 --> 38:26.981
Especially with all the green tea,
the trips to the john, the soy milk.

38:26.981 --> 38:30.750
Stage four prostate cancer.

38:31.932 --> 38:35.534
That's probably already
spread to his kidneys.

38:35.719 --> 38:37.738
It's a lot of crap, Margie.

38:37.738 --> 38:41.002
Even if you had wanted him to
make love to you, he couldn't.

38:41.002 --> 38:43.403
But he can't accept that.

38:43.403 --> 38:45.353
He can't admit it.

38:45.656 --> 38:51.022
That's, um, probably why
he lied about having an affair with you.

38:51.907 --> 38:53.970
Why didn't you tell me?

38:53.970 --> 38:56.555
That would have spoiled his plans.

38:57.740 --> 39:02.104
I mean, he didn't care that you were...

39:02.104 --> 39:06.528
Iovely and special.

39:08.039 --> 39:13.831
He cared that he could use you
and discard you.

39:15.560 --> 39:17.290
You see?

39:17.290 --> 39:19.451
That's why he planted these chemicals.

39:19.451 --> 39:24.321
But then you dumped your husband
for a new life with Dancing Donny.

39:24.321 --> 39:27.373
No clean get away this time.

39:27.373 --> 39:28.456
New plan.

39:28.456 --> 39:32.723
Two days ago, he went back
to stake out the bank without you.

39:32.723 --> 39:37.422
That's when he saw there was an
armored car delivery to the O.T.B. Next door.

39:37.422 --> 39:41.525
The delivery that you didn't know about.

39:42.197 --> 39:44.236
And that's why he changed the time,

39:44.236 --> 39:47.230
so you would run right into
those armed guards.

39:47.230 --> 39:50.861
And he would have been right there
with his starter's pistol.

39:50.861 --> 39:53.153
The two of you wouldn't have
stood a chance.

39:53.153 --> 39:56.427
It's called "suicide by cop."

39:58.730 --> 40:01.909
The big finale.

40:02.623 --> 40:04.610
You see, he's looking at a bad death.

40:04.610 --> 40:07.264
But he can't face it,
because he's a coward.

40:07.264 --> 40:14.228
I mean, who else is gonna send
a mother of two to rob a bank for them?

40:15.567 --> 40:17.127
Not a word of it, Margie.

40:17.127 --> 40:20.385
Not a word of it is true.
I'm not suicidal.

40:20.385 --> 40:22.538
Margie, don't believe him.

40:22.538 --> 40:24.766
If you let him walk outta here,

40:24.766 --> 40:28.859
he's just gonna find someone else
to fill his dance card.

40:28.859 --> 40:32.546
Someone... like you.

40:32.874 --> 40:35.687
Unless you stop him.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.448
Come on!

40:53.506 --> 40:55.252
I don't believe them.

40:55.252 --> 40:57.493
I just don't believe them.

40:57.493 --> 40:59.203
All right.

41:01.198 --> 41:05.168
Let's get Donny back to his holding cell.

41:05.670 --> 41:09.707
You deserve better, Margie, you know.

41:10.143 --> 41:14.163
But we can't twist your arm, right?
But you deserve better.

41:18.531 --> 41:21.094
Hold on a second.

41:24.286 --> 41:28.355
There were 17 tablets here.
Now there's only 13.

41:28.355 --> 41:31.400
I don't see 'em.

41:32.455 --> 41:34.920
Don't look at me.

41:34.920 --> 41:37.738
- Empty your pockets.
- I didn't take 'em.

41:38.205 --> 41:40.727
Four is more than a lethal dose.
E-Empty your pockets.

41:40.727 --> 41:42.030
This is bull.

41:42.030 --> 41:42.963
All right.

41:42.963 --> 41:45.518
Now search him.

41:55.795 --> 41:57.065
It's a trick, Margie.

41:57.065 --> 41:59.756
- L-I didn't take those.
- You see?

42:00.099 --> 42:04.237
Huh? When we were all just sitting here,

42:04.237 --> 42:06.072
see what he was thinking about?

42:06.072 --> 42:12.126
- I'm not crazy and I'm not suicidal.
- But he's dying.

42:12.354 --> 42:17.093
And all he wants to do is to kill,
to be killed.

42:17.093 --> 42:20.180
Kill himself.

42:24.191 --> 42:27.134
Oh, my God.
What have I done?

42:27.134 --> 42:28.962
- Donny, you really were going to...
- Shut up!

42:28.962 --> 42:31.742
You really were going to kill us both.

42:31.742 --> 42:33.831
You were going to kill me?

42:36.412 --> 42:39.054
You have no idea what it's going
to be like for me, do you?

42:39.054 --> 42:41.774
I don't deserve this!

42:50.410 --> 42:56.489
Whenever you're ready, my client's
willing to make a statement against Mr. DePalma.

43:03.375 --> 43:05.611
It's Vitamin "C."

43:07.330 --> 43:09.458
I watched you very carefully, Detective,

43:09.458 --> 43:12.581
but I missed you slipping them into his pocket.

43:12.581 --> 43:16.272
Maybe because you watched
the wrong detective?
