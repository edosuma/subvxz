WEBVTT

00:01.727 --> 00:03.502
(train bell chiming)

00:11.661 --> 00:13.345
- The door's locked
from the inside?

00:13.497 --> 00:14.138
- Yes, ma'am.

00:16.183 --> 00:16.974
- Key, please.

00:19.428 --> 00:22.429
My uncle is an invalid, he
requires absolute privacy.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.647
Do you understand?

00:25.342 --> 00:26.859
See to it.

00:27.086 --> 00:29.862
(suspenseful music)

00:57.132 --> 00:59.391
- We'll take a special
overnight train.

00:59.618 --> 01:01.709
I've cleared the tracks and
had the telegraph lanes cut

01:01.804 --> 01:03.637
from here to Baltimore.

01:03.731 --> 01:06.523
These men intend to kill you.

01:17.912 --> 01:20.412
You can't risk being recognized.

01:30.149 --> 01:33.258
(train whistle blowing)

01:36.155 --> 01:38.931
(suspenseful music)

01:55.674 --> 01:57.524
- Now

01:57.618 --> 02:00.035
- This is not how I planned
to get to Washington.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.292
- [Man] Ladies and gentlemen,

02:07.444 --> 02:10.187
some of you may
have heard of him.

02:10.205 --> 02:11.613
- [Woman] His story
has been passed down

02:11.632 --> 02:13.615
from one generation to the next.

02:13.709 --> 02:16.526
- Four score and
seven years ago.

02:16.545 --> 02:19.546
- He felt that democracy
in its purest form

02:19.640 --> 02:21.865
is for all people.

02:21.958 --> 02:24.034
- [Lincoln] All
persons held as slaves

02:24.052 --> 02:27.371
shall be thence forward
and forever free.

02:27.464 --> 02:30.891
- But there's something
deeper than what he did.

02:30.985 --> 02:32.967
It's about who he was.

02:32.987 --> 02:35.395
- Lincoln grew up in poverty.

02:35.547 --> 02:36.563
- Haven't done anything

02:36.657 --> 02:37.898
to make anyone remember
that I ever lived.

02:38.050 --> 02:39.158
- He's living proof

02:39.309 --> 02:42.161
that Americans can rise
from obscurity to power.

02:42.312 --> 02:45.664
- With that wit and that
charm and that intellect.

02:45.815 --> 02:48.149
- It's better to stay
silent and be thought a fool

02:48.243 --> 02:49.835
than to speak up and
remove all doubt.

02:49.986 --> 02:52.245
- He has this deep
sense of empathy.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.398
- [Christy] He takes the
Declaration of Independence.

02:54.416 --> 02:56.175
- All men are created equal.

02:56.326 --> 02:59.994
- And turns it into a
nation's moral compass.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.421
(glass shattering)

03:01.515 --> 03:03.073
(mob shouting)

03:03.091 --> 03:05.833
- As the country is breaking
apart, there's a turning point

03:05.928 --> 03:07.244
where he's gonna
have to take a stand.

03:07.337 --> 03:08.836
- Charge!
(guns banging)

03:08.856 --> 03:10.338
- Blood will be on your hands!

03:10.432 --> 03:12.691
- Blood is already on my hands!

03:12.918 --> 03:14.693
- You have to learn how to
be a Commander in Chief.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.586
- I can't have a
war on two fronts.

03:16.605 --> 03:20.257
- He was willing to admit
he was wrong and to change.

03:20.275 --> 03:21.533
- We can attack immediately.

03:21.685 --> 03:23.777
- [Doris] He was the right
person at the right time.

03:23.929 --> 03:26.038
- If we let this stand
for one minute longer,

03:26.265 --> 03:27.447
(gun bangs)

03:27.599 --> 03:29.208
We might as well say
goodbye to the whole thing.

03:30.285 --> 03:32.169
Union, democracy,

03:33.863 --> 03:34.880
all of it.

03:35.031 --> 03:37.716
(dramatic music)

03:45.133 --> 03:47.893
(hammer thudding)

03:57.980 --> 04:00.364
- Abe, come here.

04:13.662 --> 04:14.586
Hold it steady.

04:26.174 --> 04:29.993
(hammer thudding)

04:30.086 --> 04:33.272
- You think anyone will
know mom is in there?

04:35.091 --> 04:39.002
- God will know.

04:39.095 --> 04:42.839
- We should put a marker,
write her name on it.

04:42.858 --> 04:43.615
- Leave it alone.

04:45.769 --> 04:48.695
- When Lincoln's mother
died, she had said to him,

04:48.847 --> 04:53.533
Abraham, I'm going away from
you now and I shall not return.

04:53.685 --> 04:56.944
Death was a common traveler
during that period of time.

04:57.039 --> 04:59.631
- Lincoln's childhood was hard.

04:59.783 --> 05:02.876
Lincoln's father was a
carpenter some of the time,

05:02.970 --> 05:05.119
farmer some of the time.

05:05.213 --> 05:07.222
He wasn't good at making money.

05:11.219 --> 05:13.887
- Abraham Lincoln
had a hard scrabble,

05:14.039 --> 05:16.873
poverty ridden existence.

05:16.892 --> 05:18.892
- They lived on the frontier

05:18.986 --> 05:21.987
in a one room cabin
that had a dirt floor.

05:23.549 --> 05:24.731
- [Doris] There were
times when he fell into

05:24.883 --> 05:27.159
an extreme sense of
sadness and melancholy,

05:27.386 --> 05:29.328
that would stay with him
the rest of his life.

05:31.740 --> 05:33.390
- [Harold] After the
death of his mother,

05:33.408 --> 05:35.149
his father traveled
to civilization

05:35.243 --> 05:37.002
looking for a replacement wife.

05:38.730 --> 05:41.081
And he was left alone
with his older sister

05:41.175 --> 05:42.257
for months and months.

05:44.345 --> 05:46.970
(somber music)

05:58.750 --> 06:00.007
- [Doris] How the
children survived

06:00.027 --> 06:03.320
that time alone on the
frontier is hard to imagine.

06:04.606 --> 06:06.681
They were foraging for food.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.367
They looked like wild animals.

06:14.433 --> 06:17.450
- In the early 1800s
Lincoln is at the edge of

06:17.544 --> 06:19.936
what is the American frontier.

06:19.955 --> 06:23.289
- It's just six years after
the Louisiana Purchase.

06:23.442 --> 06:26.943
The nation expands all the way
over to the Mississippi River

06:27.036 --> 06:30.130
and parts of the northwestern
and plains areas.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.372
- We can trace

06:31.392 --> 06:32.966
the movement of the
American population

06:33.060 --> 06:34.300
across the continent.

06:34.395 --> 06:36.970
And the Lincoln family is
exemplifying that trend

06:37.122 --> 06:39.380
and they moved
steadily westward.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.400
- Frontier life is dangerous,

06:41.551 --> 06:44.127
and consists of a
lot of hard labor.

06:44.220 --> 06:45.812
Clearing the land,
chopping down trees,

06:45.906 --> 06:47.964
removing tree stumps.

06:47.983 --> 06:49.466
Lincoln is a hard worker,

06:49.484 --> 06:50.967
but he doesn't like
physical labor.

06:51.060 --> 06:52.994
He's not someone
who enjoys farming.

07:00.737 --> 07:02.312
(horse neighing)

07:02.330 --> 07:03.980
- [Ted] After a few months,

07:04.073 --> 07:06.650
Lincoln's father
remarried a woman

07:06.743 --> 07:08.677
named Sarah Bush Johnston.

07:10.597 --> 07:11.680
- Hey, there you are.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.683
Come on.

07:23.944 --> 07:24.776
Go on.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.209
- You can read, Abraham?

08:06.228 --> 08:07.277
- Sorry, ma'am.

08:15.570 --> 08:16.828
- It's all right.

08:23.061 --> 08:24.503
- There's plenty
of work out there.

08:25.339 --> 08:26.254
Come on.

08:35.574 --> 08:38.332
- We're used to reading
about evil stepmothers,

08:38.352 --> 08:40.243
Lincoln had a good stepmother.

08:40.262 --> 08:42.595
She brought a little
library of books.

08:42.689 --> 08:45.190
She couldn't even read them
herself, but she had them.

08:45.341 --> 08:49.528
- And she forges an
extraordinary bond with Abraham.

08:49.679 --> 08:54.699
She understood him, she
sympathized with him.

08:54.926 --> 08:57.184
She would encourage
him about reading

08:57.279 --> 08:59.445
and education and ambition.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.355
- He's basically self-taught.

09:01.449 --> 09:04.191
He read some of the best
writing in the English language.

09:04.286 --> 09:07.604
The King James Bible,
Shakespeare, and Greek classics,

09:07.622 --> 09:09.455
and a few other
adventure books thrown in

09:09.550 --> 09:10.790
like Robinson Crusoe.

09:10.942 --> 09:16.112
He was drawing from this
incredibly rich fountain.

09:16.631 --> 09:18.631
- He went to a primitive school
for less than one full year

09:18.784 --> 09:20.133
where he stood out.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.467
One of his friends said,

09:21.620 --> 09:24.287
his ambition soared
beyond all the rest of us.

09:24.306 --> 09:26.122
That while we were playing,

09:26.215 --> 09:28.625
he was reading and
rereading his books.

09:28.718 --> 09:30.293
- [Harold] The most
impressive thing

09:30.386 --> 09:31.403
about Lincoln's ability
to teach himself

09:31.630 --> 09:35.148
is his mastery of Euclid,
he loved geometry.

09:35.300 --> 09:36.908
- [Doris] He's reading
about George Washington.

09:37.135 --> 09:38.985
He's reading about
the founding fathers.

09:39.137 --> 09:41.471
- He is reading that all
men are created equal.

09:41.564 --> 09:43.230
It's the most
revolutionary statement

09:43.250 --> 09:46.585
ever articulated by
any founding country.

09:46.736 --> 09:48.545
That is a mindblowing
proposition.

09:52.651 --> 09:54.317
- Where'd you get that?

09:54.410 --> 09:57.670
- I borrowed it
from Mr. Crawford.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.264
- Put it away and get to bed.

09:59.491 --> 10:00.673
I'm gonna need you
to dig out them rocks

10:00.767 --> 10:01.766
first thing tomorrow.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.090
- His father didn't understand

10:09.109 --> 10:13.094
why Abraham chose to read
instead of to work on the farm.

10:13.188 --> 10:15.780
He thought it was
a sign of laziness.

10:16.007 --> 10:18.450
But Abraham had a
different set of ambitions.

10:18.677 --> 10:21.527
Through everything he
read, he began to imagine,

10:21.622 --> 10:23.680
to envision another way of life.

10:23.698 --> 10:26.458
(thunder booming)

11:05.724 --> 11:06.498
- It rained last night.

11:10.578 --> 11:13.396
- This is worth 75 cents.

11:13.415 --> 11:15.799
- I'll work it up, I
swear, Mr. Crawford.

11:18.995 --> 11:20.845
- Three days
working in my fields.

11:25.577 --> 11:27.811
(Abe grunts)

11:32.267 --> 11:34.175
- [Doris] This kid
doesn't share the values

11:34.194 --> 11:35.944
of physical labor
with his father.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.013
He yearns to fight his way out

11:39.107 --> 11:40.699
of that daily
struggle for survival.

11:48.357 --> 11:50.709
- [Sue] Crawford
ought to be ashamed.

11:50.860 --> 11:52.693
- Ouch.
- Stay still.

11:52.713 --> 11:56.289
- Three days work,
nothing to show for it.

11:56.441 --> 11:58.049
- I get to keep the book.

11:58.201 --> 11:59.175
It's mine now.

12:01.370 --> 12:03.279
- But despite the
tension between them,

12:03.372 --> 12:06.373
Abe got his storytelling
talent from his father,

12:06.468 --> 12:08.451
who did have a great
sense of humor.

12:08.544 --> 12:09.969
- So this preacher
starts his sermon

12:10.063 --> 12:13.898
by saying to the congregation,
today I represent the Christ.

12:14.125 --> 12:17.902
Just then this little blue
lizard runs up his pants

12:18.129 --> 12:22.741
and he starts to kick
them pants off. (laughs)

12:22.968 --> 12:25.985
- A little blue lizard
runs up the preachers leg.

12:26.137 --> 12:28.654
Off come his pants.

12:28.749 --> 12:30.731
The lizard runs under his shirt.

12:30.825 --> 12:32.825
Well, that comes off too.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.253
One little old lady
from the congregation

12:35.480 --> 12:36.737
can't take anymore.

12:36.831 --> 12:37.922
She shouts to the preacher,

12:38.149 --> 12:41.075
who's standing there,
no pants, no shirt on.

12:41.169 --> 12:45.096
If you represent the Christ
I am done with the Bible!

12:46.767 --> 12:48.674
- That yarn of a lie
when your Pa told it,

12:48.769 --> 12:49.659
and it's still a lie.

12:49.677 --> 12:51.394
- It's a mighty good lie though.

12:53.164 --> 12:56.332
- Gentlemen, names
Dennis Offutt,

12:56.351 --> 12:58.276
looking for Mr. John Hanks.

12:58.503 --> 12:59.068
- That's me.

13:01.764 --> 13:03.764
- Need some men to
build me a flatboat,

13:03.858 --> 13:06.100
take some barrels
down to New Orleans.

13:06.194 --> 13:07.693
I heard you're a river man.

13:07.788 --> 13:08.787
- New Orleans?

13:10.290 --> 13:13.107
- I can't be gone that long,
got a family to tend to.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.518
- I'll pay you a decent wage.

13:15.611 --> 13:17.186
- Well, I could go
for you, Mr. Offutt.

13:17.205 --> 13:19.038
I made a trip to New Orleans

13:19.132 --> 13:20.632
with cousin John here
a couple years back.

13:20.783 --> 13:22.375
- This ain't a job
for a jokester.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.426
Serious work.

13:28.291 --> 13:29.474
I'll take the group of ya.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.052
- Whaddya say?

13:33.146 --> 13:35.146
John, this could be my chance.

13:35.373 --> 13:36.797
- All right.

13:36.891 --> 13:37.982
- Got a deal then, huh?

13:40.987 --> 13:41.986
- Thank you, Mr. Offutt.

13:42.138 --> 13:43.071
-Pleasure sir.

13:46.051 --> 13:47.900
- He could read about
other people's adventures,

13:47.994 --> 13:50.161
but now this was an
adventure of his own.

13:50.313 --> 13:52.722
He begins to create
that wider world

13:52.815 --> 13:55.074
that he's dreamed of
since he was a little kid.

13:55.226 --> 13:58.744
- He took his flatboat journey
down the Mississippi River

13:58.839 --> 14:03.566
to New Orleans and there
he saw the big city.

14:03.659 --> 14:05.918
He saw what a new
world might look like

14:06.071 --> 14:08.137
beyond the remote farm.

14:09.924 --> 14:12.075
- And during the
course of that visit,

14:12.168 --> 14:14.477
he saw more than
he had ever seen.

14:16.172 --> 14:18.264
New Orleans was the
largest slave trading port

14:18.358 --> 14:20.191
in the United States.

14:20.418 --> 14:24.511
- He saw human beings
with hearts and minds

14:24.606 --> 14:28.324
being sold like chattel,
like animals, like furniture.

14:29.944 --> 14:32.996
And it left a lasting and
haunting impression on him.

14:38.194 --> 14:39.936
- When he comes back home,

14:40.029 --> 14:42.121
there was a law in
Illinois at the time

14:42.273 --> 14:45.291
that you had to give
your wages to your father

14:45.385 --> 14:48.553
until you reached the age
of majority, which was 21.

14:48.780 --> 14:52.298
He's now 21, so he can
strike out on his own.

14:52.450 --> 14:55.226
Offutt offers him a job to be
a clerk in his general store.

14:58.139 --> 14:59.230
- You'll be back by winter.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.718
- I'm gonna be a clerk
now, in a new store.

15:04.812 --> 15:05.987
- Stores go under every day.

15:07.056 --> 15:07.864
- So do farmers.

15:10.059 --> 15:12.076
I'm gonna keep
studying, be ready.

15:14.656 --> 15:15.538
- You'll do fine.

15:21.737 --> 15:22.503
- Bye, Pa.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.841
(somber music)

15:48.597 --> 15:52.116
(fighters grunting)

15:52.268 --> 15:53.434
- [Man] That your new man?

15:53.528 --> 15:55.286
- Yeah, that's Lincoln.

15:55.513 --> 15:58.439
- [Bystander] That's
an illegal hold!

15:58.533 --> 16:00.366
(fighters grunting)

16:00.518 --> 16:02.943
- I've never seen
Armstrong lose.

16:03.037 --> 16:04.203
How long they been at it?

16:04.355 --> 16:06.780
- About an hour. (laughs)

16:06.874 --> 16:08.874
(fighters grunting)

16:09.027 --> 16:11.636
- Armstrong, preventing
this will fail.

16:11.787 --> 16:13.304
- It ain't over til I win.

16:14.882 --> 16:15.640
- Call it a draw.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.142
Then we both win.

16:22.816 --> 16:25.483
(crow murmuring)

16:27.470 --> 16:28.152
- It's a draw.

16:33.976 --> 16:35.735
- New Salem was a tough town.

16:35.887 --> 16:40.056
There was a gang led by a
tough guy named Jack Armstrong.

16:40.074 --> 16:44.076
Newcomers had to prove
themselves or be on the outs.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.395
- New Salem itself is
yet another one of these

16:46.489 --> 16:48.731
just emerging frontier towns.

16:48.750 --> 16:51.584
It's very small, just
a few hundred people.

16:51.736 --> 16:54.420
- But for Lincoln, it seems
like a bustling metropolis.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.572
There's a post office,
there's three general stores,

16:56.591 --> 16:58.241
there's a blacksmith's shop.

16:58.259 --> 16:59.925
- It had an
intellectual community,

17:00.078 --> 17:02.169
it had a little
debating society,

17:02.188 --> 17:05.356
it had a teacher who
loaned him books.

17:05.583 --> 17:07.600
- He's demonstrated
his physical prowess.

17:07.752 --> 17:08.751
He's a hard worker.

17:08.770 --> 17:11.362
He's also known for
his intelligence.

17:11.514 --> 17:14.106
- And he will have the
funniest stories to tell.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.927
He will have you and
your friends in stitches.

17:17.945 --> 17:20.187
- And Lincoln has to
learn how to hustle.

17:20.206 --> 17:24.709
He's a store owner, he's a
land surveyor, a shopkeeper.

17:24.860 --> 17:29.455
- Eventually Lincoln became
a grocer and he sold whiskey.

17:29.607 --> 17:32.291
He also becomes the
village postmaster,

17:32.443 --> 17:35.795
and that's where he first
got news beyond Illinois.

17:35.947 --> 17:39.557
Reading about issues far
beyond his limited sphere.

17:39.708 --> 17:41.059
- Everybody would
come to the store,

17:41.286 --> 17:44.303
they'd debate issues, they'd
stay around and talk politics.

17:44.455 --> 17:46.731
- He was always
interested in politics.

17:47.975 --> 17:48.733
He loved politics.

17:50.628 --> 17:52.628
- In little towns
like New Salem,

17:52.647 --> 17:55.222
politicians running for office
would come on Saturdays.

17:55.316 --> 17:56.315
And gives speeches.

17:56.467 --> 17:58.984
- Illinois needs railroads.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.971
You got a railroad, you can
get your goods to market.

18:02.064 --> 18:04.323
Y'all elect me to state assembly

18:04.475 --> 18:07.568
and I swear I'll bring
the railroad right

18:07.587 --> 18:08.994
here to New Salem.

18:09.147 --> 18:12.090
(audience applauds)

18:12.241 --> 18:15.000
- No, you won't.
- I beg your pardon?

18:15.095 --> 18:16.577
Who said that?

18:16.596 --> 18:17.261
- I did.

18:18.673 --> 18:20.840
See, the way I figure it,

18:20.992 --> 18:23.993
if they do build that railroad
it'll be near Springfield.

18:24.086 --> 18:26.104
I saw as much in the paper.

18:26.255 --> 18:27.271
And how far are we
from Springfield?

18:27.423 --> 18:29.590
About what, 20 miles?

18:29.609 --> 18:31.258
That won't do us a lick of good.

18:31.277 --> 18:32.426
See, this fella,
he's right about us

18:32.520 --> 18:33.853
needing to get to market,

18:34.005 --> 18:36.839
but what we need in New
Salem is to widen the river

18:36.858 --> 18:38.858
so the steamships can get here.

18:39.010 --> 18:40.434
Then this town will take off,

18:40.453 --> 18:42.603
like a rabbit in front
of a pack of wolves.

18:42.697 --> 18:45.456
- Well, I could vote for both,
waterway and the railroad.

18:46.609 --> 18:48.442
- I don't think so, mister.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.703
How much that
railroad gonna cost?

18:50.797 --> 18:52.021
A lot, right?

18:52.039 --> 18:53.280
See, this fella, he
might be able to talk

18:53.374 --> 18:55.282
the hind leg off a donkey,

18:55.301 --> 18:56.783
but if they build that railroad,

18:56.803 --> 19:00.045
there won't be a dime left
of tax money for our river.

19:00.198 --> 19:02.698
Then we'll just be like the,
like the runt of the litter,

19:02.717 --> 19:05.885
left behind squinting for a
meal when there's nothing left.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.721
(audience cheers and applauds)
- Tell 'em Abe.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.482
- There was something about
the way Lincoln spoke.

19:11.709 --> 19:13.800
He was able to
translate complex issues

19:13.820 --> 19:15.319
into something simple,

19:15.471 --> 19:17.655
terms of the daily
life of the people.

19:17.806 --> 19:20.324
Within eight months of
his being in New Salem,

19:20.476 --> 19:22.994
the residents wanted him to
run for the state legislature.

19:24.739 --> 19:26.572
- At the time we have
a two party system

19:26.724 --> 19:29.074
with the Democrats
and the Whigs.

19:29.227 --> 19:32.912
And the Whig Party
was most interested in

19:33.006 --> 19:35.489
infrastructure that would
help the country grow.

19:35.583 --> 19:38.067
- Lincoln very much defines
himself initially as a Whig.

19:38.085 --> 19:39.677
An ardent advocate for
the federal government

19:39.828 --> 19:41.662
taking a particularly
active role

19:41.681 --> 19:44.515
in promoting improved
railroads or turnpike networks,

19:44.667 --> 19:46.500
and navigable rivers.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.078
- In Lincoln's day, if you
wanted to run for office,

19:49.171 --> 19:51.189
you simply put out a handbill

19:51.340 --> 19:54.341
telling what your promises
were and what you stood for.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.253
So at 23 years old he
writes this handbill

19:57.271 --> 19:59.513
and it's an
extraordinary document.

19:59.607 --> 20:02.425
First of all, most politicians
put out a short document.

20:02.443 --> 20:06.520
His is 2,000 words long,
and it's very personal.

20:06.539 --> 20:09.707
It starts saying, every man
has his peculiar ambition.

20:09.858 --> 20:12.543
Mine is to be esteemed
by my fellow man.

20:12.695 --> 20:15.529
And what he means by that is
to accomplish something worthy

20:15.623 --> 20:17.773
so my story will be told.

20:17.792 --> 20:19.959
- In that same time, he
talks about how he grew up.

20:20.111 --> 20:21.627
I was born, I've ever remained

20:21.779 --> 20:24.129
in the most humble
walks of life.

20:24.224 --> 20:27.892
If you elect me, I'm still
gonna be this humble guy.

20:28.119 --> 20:29.894
I'm not gonna become
somebody different.

20:30.121 --> 20:31.896
- [Doris] And then he
says, I promise you,

20:32.047 --> 20:35.566
I will do everything I can to
make my promises come true.

20:35.718 --> 20:37.551
- He's a young man
on the make, right?

20:37.570 --> 20:39.478
And then he wasn't
shy about it either.

20:39.630 --> 20:42.798
Lincoln seems to emerge
out of the roughness

20:42.891 --> 20:45.317
and ambition and the hunger

20:45.470 --> 20:48.061
of what was certainly
a very young country.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.731
He had pulled himself
out of poverty.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.233
There was no shame in
saying, I want to be famous.

20:53.253 --> 20:55.494
He's unembarrassed
about forging alliances

20:55.646 --> 20:57.162
with people who can help him.

20:57.315 --> 20:59.072
He wants to make
people like him.

20:59.166 --> 21:01.092
He is a politician.

21:01.319 --> 21:03.669
- I'm from New Salem,
Abraham Lincoln.

21:03.821 --> 21:04.762
I'm running for state assembly.

21:06.841 --> 21:09.100
I'll tell you what, if I can
toss this thing past yours,

21:09.251 --> 21:09.934
you take a look at this?

21:10.161 --> 21:12.495
It'll tell you where I stand.

21:12.513 --> 21:15.106
- Hell, you toss this
ball farther than me,

21:15.257 --> 21:15.940
I'll vote for you.

21:17.685 --> 21:18.442
- All right.

21:21.114 --> 21:23.114
What about you boys?
- You get all our votes.

21:30.515 --> 21:32.790
(Abe grunts)

21:34.777 --> 21:38.037
- In 1834 Abraham
Lincoln is elected

21:38.189 --> 21:40.856
to the Illinois state
legislature as a Whig,

21:40.949 --> 21:42.300
a new political
party established

21:42.527 --> 21:44.543
by United States
Senator, Henry Clay,

21:44.695 --> 21:48.121
to promote infrastructure, a
national bank, and tariffs.

21:48.141 --> 21:53.035
And he becomes one of the
Long Nine of Sangamon County,

21:53.704 --> 21:57.039
- The Long Nine were a
group of Whig legislators,

21:57.058 --> 21:58.965
including Lincoln,
who got their name

21:58.985 --> 22:01.819
because they were all
over six feet tall.

22:02.046 --> 22:03.804
They advocated for
internal improvements

22:03.898 --> 22:04.989
for the state of Illinois,

22:05.140 --> 22:07.641
that they wanted to
move the state Capitol

22:07.660 --> 22:10.402
from the sleepy little
town of Vandalia

22:10.555 --> 22:11.495
to Springfield, Illinois.

22:14.334 --> 22:17.168
- We gotta move the capital
from Vandalia to Springfield.

22:17.319 --> 22:20.153
- But the Democrats will do
whatever they can to stop us.

22:20.173 --> 22:22.898
They're already trying to
redraw Sangamon County lines.

22:22.991 --> 22:24.342
That means two
less seats for us.

22:25.994 --> 22:27.920
- We want the capital
in Springfield,

22:28.072 --> 22:30.014
in Sangamon, in our county.

22:30.241 --> 22:31.331
Why?

22:31.425 --> 22:32.424
- Because there's value
to having the power

22:32.577 --> 22:34.018
in our own backyard.

22:34.245 --> 22:36.595
- So, if it's valuable,
shouldn't there

22:36.689 --> 22:39.915
be a cost for it?

22:39.934 --> 22:40.691
There's a spending
bill coming up, right?

22:40.918 --> 22:41.525
- Right.

22:43.087 --> 22:45.029
- What if we tack
on an amendment

22:45.256 --> 22:48.257
that says whatever
city gets the capital

22:48.275 --> 22:50.701
will have to pay the state
of fee for that privilege.

22:51.871 --> 22:55.280
A large fee, $50,000.

22:55.433 --> 22:57.041
Vandalia could
never afford that.

22:57.952 --> 22:59.043
But Sangamon could.

23:00.104 --> 23:02.046
That's what I'm thinking.

23:02.197 --> 23:06.275
- Lincoln was immediately
perceived as different, unique,

23:06.293 --> 23:08.201
wily and smart.

23:08.221 --> 23:10.613
Taller than everyone else,
funnier than everyone else,

23:10.706 --> 23:12.781
stronger than everyone else.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.207
He was a magnetic person.

23:14.301 --> 23:17.786
He was always making friends
and they gravitated to him.

23:17.805 --> 23:20.623
And he meets John T.
Stewart who advises him

23:20.716 --> 23:22.716
that he should study the law.

23:22.735 --> 23:25.236
- He had to study it
all on his own, however.

23:25.387 --> 23:27.405
He would have to borrow
books from John Stewart,

23:27.556 --> 23:28.814
who was 20 miles away.

23:28.966 --> 23:31.575
He'd have to walk those
20 miles, borrow the book,

23:31.802 --> 23:33.894
come back, read the
book, return the book,

23:33.988 --> 23:34.912
and then get another one.

23:35.063 --> 23:36.229
But he passed the bar.

23:36.249 --> 23:39.158
- He's now on his way,
he's taken another step.

23:39.252 --> 23:42.920
He's gonna be around people
who make things happen.

23:43.071 --> 23:45.256
- He would in fact,
serve four terms

23:45.483 --> 23:47.407
in the Illinois
state legislature.

23:47.501 --> 23:51.411
And with each term, his profile
and his prestige would grow.

23:51.431 --> 23:54.098
He promotes roads,
he promotes canals.

23:55.417 --> 23:56.825
- The American economy
is transforming

23:56.844 --> 23:59.178
in the early decades
of the 19th century.

23:59.330 --> 24:02.498
The transportation
revolution is so crucial

24:02.591 --> 24:04.516
to moving goods and people,

24:04.610 --> 24:07.503
factories which are using
new steam technology

24:07.521 --> 24:10.096
makes cotton profitable in
a way that it hadn't been.

24:10.191 --> 24:12.024
Makes it the boom crop.

24:12.176 --> 24:13.676
Changes the Southern economy,

24:13.694 --> 24:16.954
where slave based agriculture
becomes enormously profitable.

24:18.683 --> 24:20.774
- The entire United States
benefits from slavery,

24:20.793 --> 24:23.519
even if they want to
argue that they don't.

24:23.537 --> 24:26.112
Northern cotton mills
are reliant upon

24:26.207 --> 24:29.282
the cotton produced by
enslaved laborers in the south.

24:29.302 --> 24:31.469
The insurance industry
in New York City

24:31.620 --> 24:33.545
is where slave holders
bought policies

24:33.639 --> 24:36.456
to protect the bodies of
their enslaved men and women.

24:36.476 --> 24:38.367
Merchants, bankers, the brokers,

24:38.460 --> 24:40.552
the people who extended loans,

24:40.646 --> 24:45.131
they are all tied up in
the institution of slavery.

24:45.151 --> 24:46.892
- It's this global enterprise.

24:47.044 --> 24:49.135
In key areas of the deep south,

24:49.155 --> 24:50.713
you're talking about communities

24:50.806 --> 24:54.641
that are 60 to 70% enslaved.

24:54.660 --> 24:57.886
So the use of
terror and violence

24:57.980 --> 25:00.572
have been the method of control.

25:00.666 --> 25:02.500
- [Caroline] But there
certainly were white northerners

25:02.727 --> 25:05.503
who believed that
slavery is morally wrong.

25:05.654 --> 25:07.505
They are abolitionist.

25:07.732 --> 25:10.841
- And at the heart of
all of these things

25:11.068 --> 25:12.568
is the story of
Abraham Lincoln himself

25:12.586 --> 25:14.753
and his own transformation.

25:14.847 --> 25:18.665
- At the time, Lincoln
was an anti-slavery man.

25:18.759 --> 25:20.743
He didn't like slavery,

25:20.761 --> 25:23.503
but that didn't mean that
he was an abolitionist.

25:23.523 --> 25:25.839
- He thought that eventually
slavery would die away

25:25.933 --> 25:27.266
and rot on the vine.

25:27.360 --> 25:30.694
But as a politician, he had
to be very, very cautious

25:30.921 --> 25:34.031
in expressing his
anti-slavery views.

25:36.202 --> 25:39.094
- Once the capital gets
moved to Springfield,

25:39.113 --> 25:41.205
he arrives in
Springfield on a horse

25:41.356 --> 25:44.283
and two saddlebags with all
of his possessions, that's it.

25:44.435 --> 25:46.693
And he gets an offer to
have a junior partnership

25:46.787 --> 25:50.530
in a law practice with John
Stewart, his fellow legislator.

25:50.624 --> 25:54.960
- He moved to Springfield,
Illinois on April 15th, 1837.

25:55.054 --> 25:58.280
I always find that to be
bizarrely coincidental.

25:58.373 --> 26:00.391
He was 28 years
old when he moved

26:01.727 --> 26:05.062
and he had 28 years more
to live to the very day.

26:06.399 --> 26:09.233
(patrons laughing)

26:14.965 --> 26:16.073
- [Shopkeep] You can
try it on if you like.

26:16.300 --> 26:18.300
- Oh no, thank you,
I'm only looking.

26:18.319 --> 26:18.909
- Can I help you?

26:20.228 --> 26:21.912
- How much would a bed cost?

26:23.140 --> 26:24.415
Well, I can sell
you one for $17.

26:26.419 --> 26:27.251
- 17.

26:28.479 --> 26:29.253
I see.

26:29.404 --> 26:30.087
Thank you.

26:36.670 --> 26:37.911
Here's the thing, mister.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.097
- Joshua, Joshua Speed.
- Oh, Abraham Lincoln.

26:41.992 --> 26:45.828
I'm newly arrived and I'm
a freshly minted lawyer

26:45.846 --> 26:47.605
and it's not certain
I will succeed.

26:47.756 --> 26:49.331
- Jury's still out, is it?

26:49.350 --> 26:51.442
- (chuckles) Jury hadn't
even been chosen yet.

26:53.095 --> 26:56.763
The thing of it is is I
don't have money for the bed,

26:56.782 --> 26:57.448
not yet.

26:58.767 --> 27:00.676
- Do you have any prospects?

27:00.694 --> 27:02.786
- Yes, I'm partnering
with John Stewart.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.122
He's well-established.

27:06.626 --> 27:08.775
- I've got a room upstairs
with a bed in it, you know,

27:08.794 --> 27:10.202
if you're looking for a share.

27:10.296 --> 27:12.371
Come on, take a look
and see if you like it.

27:12.523 --> 27:13.538
- Yeah.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.524
- [Joshua] These are
the boys, by the way.

27:15.542 --> 27:17.450
- Hi, gentlemen.
- Abe Lincoln.

27:17.470 --> 27:19.637
- The man managing the
store is a young man

27:19.788 --> 27:21.196
named Joshua Speed.

27:21.289 --> 27:23.215
Speed and Lincoln take an almost

27:23.367 --> 27:25.033
instant liking to each other.

27:25.052 --> 27:28.294
The two are about as close
as anyone really gets

27:28.389 --> 27:29.554
to Abraham Lincoln,

27:29.707 --> 27:32.465
who was otherwise a very,
very private person.

27:32.485 --> 27:35.544
- For the next four years,
they lived in the same room,

27:35.562 --> 27:37.229
they slept in the same bed.

27:37.381 --> 27:40.140
There were more people
than beds in those days.

27:40.159 --> 27:42.567
- When business was over
with the store for the day,

27:42.662 --> 27:43.994
in the back room

27:44.146 --> 27:48.407
all the young political,
ambitious types would gather.

27:48.559 --> 27:50.409
- [Doris] It's there that
he meets Stephen Douglas,

27:50.561 --> 27:51.894
the Little Giant as he's called

27:51.912 --> 27:55.488
because he's short of stature,
but huge in personality.

27:55.582 --> 27:58.233
And as a Democrat, he's
opposed to government support

27:58.326 --> 28:00.160
for infrastructure projects.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.420
- [Harold] And Douglas
becomes Lincoln's

28:01.572 --> 28:03.347
lifelong political rival.

28:04.909 --> 28:07.685
- And then in 1837,
a sustained recession

28:07.836 --> 28:09.353
hit the state of Illinois.

28:09.504 --> 28:10.929
Up til that point,

28:11.081 --> 28:14.082
Lincoln had been the champion
of infrastructure projects.

28:14.176 --> 28:15.934
- The economy is a disaster

28:16.028 --> 28:18.770
and funding for those
damn improvement bills,

28:18.923 --> 28:20.698
it's as dead as that bear
under your feet, Lincoln.

28:20.849 --> 28:22.199
And if you keep going,

28:22.426 --> 28:24.776
your career will soon
enjoy the same fate.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.446
- A bad economy doesn't
mean that improvements

28:27.598 --> 28:30.282
to roads and waterway
should stop, Douglas.

28:30.434 --> 28:32.617
If anything, they
should be built faster.

28:32.712 --> 28:33.860
- Faster?

28:33.954 --> 28:35.120
Now you've lost me.

28:35.272 --> 28:37.530
- If it's raining, do
you stop building a roof

28:37.624 --> 28:40.217
and stand there getting wet,
or do you build a double quick?

28:42.129 --> 28:45.205
Building faster will bring
back business and trade.

28:45.224 --> 28:46.223
- It doesn't make sense.

28:46.374 --> 28:48.392
- No, it's delusional.

28:48.543 --> 28:50.969
- I made a promise to look out
for the people of Sangamon.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.471
- Well, you wouldn't
be the first politician

28:52.623 --> 28:53.622
to break a promise.

28:53.640 --> 28:55.807
- Or the last. (laughs)

28:55.901 --> 28:58.293
- I'm telling my Whigs
to vote for more funding.

28:58.312 --> 29:00.812
You should tell your
Democrats to do the same.

29:00.906 --> 29:03.465
It takes a little courage
to do what's right.

29:03.484 --> 29:06.485
- Was it a courageous man
who digs his own grave?

29:06.579 --> 29:07.244
Or just a fool.

29:09.807 --> 29:11.656
- You know, I heard
a fella say once,

29:11.809 --> 29:14.251
it's better to stay silent
and be thought a fool

29:14.478 --> 29:16.253
than to speak up and
remove all doubt.

29:18.591 --> 29:21.258
- Spin all the country
wisdom you like, Lincoln.

29:21.409 --> 29:22.426
It won't make you right.

29:26.156 --> 29:28.932
(suspenseful music)

29:32.754 --> 29:34.605
(guests chattering)

29:38.669 --> 29:40.944
- You planning on pouring that?

29:50.514 --> 29:51.288
- Thank you.

29:53.350 --> 29:55.275
- I didn't expect to
see you here, Lincoln.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.126
- Oh.

29:58.130 --> 30:01.189
- Mr. Douglas, you haven't
introduced your friend.

30:01.208 --> 30:04.450
- Ms. Mary Todd, this
is Mr. Abraham Lincoln.

30:04.545 --> 30:07.095
- Ms. Todd, I am honored.

30:08.699 --> 30:10.882
- Mr. Lincoln's a stubborn Whig,

30:11.035 --> 30:13.385
determined to drop his
carriage over a cliff

30:13.537 --> 30:16.462
when everyone else has
reigned in their horses.

30:16.482 --> 30:17.722
- Perhaps Mr.
Lincoln sees a road

30:17.875 --> 30:18.941
where you don't, Mr. Douglas.

30:22.321 --> 30:26.490
- Ms. Todd, I would like to
dance with you in the worst way.

30:40.673 --> 30:43.507
(classical music)

30:48.422 --> 30:50.997
- [Allen] Lincoln had a
great passion for women.

30:51.016 --> 30:52.924
He was very bashful,
he was very shy,

30:53.077 --> 30:54.242
but that didn't mean

30:54.261 --> 30:57.145
that he was not always
thinking about women.

30:58.506 --> 31:00.582
- Mary Todd was the
Belle of the town.

31:00.675 --> 31:03.251
She was beautiful,
she was witty.

31:03.270 --> 31:05.178
She attracted many suitors.

31:05.197 --> 31:09.867
She was actually courted by
Stephen Douglas, among others.

31:10.018 --> 31:13.519
She was educated, she came
from a long line of diplomats,

31:13.614 --> 31:15.372
ambassadors, governors.

31:15.599 --> 31:17.782
She was very
interested in politics.

31:17.935 --> 31:21.527
- She was from a prominent
Whig political family.

31:21.547 --> 31:23.380
Her father was a slave holder,

31:23.607 --> 31:25.790
but he was also a Whig
who knew Henry Clay,

31:25.943 --> 31:28.293
who was Lincoln's
political hero.

31:28.445 --> 31:31.296
- I myself am a great
admirer of Henry Clay.

31:31.448 --> 31:32.222
- Really?

31:33.726 --> 31:36.801
Wow, I didn't think that a
lady like yourself would be-

31:36.954 --> 31:38.061
- Interested in politics?

31:39.790 --> 31:42.065
I hope you'll find I'm not
like other ladies, Mr. Lincoln.

31:43.143 --> 31:44.568
(Chuckling)

31:45.312 --> 31:47.129
Now tell me,

31:47.147 --> 31:49.865
what is this cliff you're
determined to drive over?

31:51.911 --> 31:53.652
- Lincoln felt an
instant connection to

31:53.804 --> 31:55.746
her and she, to him.

31:55.897 --> 31:57.748
She saw something
in him right away.

32:04.648 --> 32:05.905
- Well, Mr. Lincoln,

32:05.925 --> 32:07.573
you said you wanted to dance
with me in the worst way

32:07.593 --> 32:08.425
and you certainly did.

32:10.262 --> 32:13.263
- Oh, well.
- Don't look so wounded.

32:14.916 --> 32:16.767
It's not your dancing
skills I'm interested in.

32:23.609 --> 32:26.926
- Finally, it seems like
all those pieces of his life

32:26.946 --> 32:28.928
came together to
allow him to rise

32:28.948 --> 32:30.338
beyond the adverse circumstances

32:30.357 --> 32:31.907
of his childhood
on the frontier.

32:33.619 --> 32:36.361
- At the time, like Lincoln,
there's another young man

32:36.513 --> 32:37.788
who was trying to rise up

32:38.015 --> 32:41.124
through education and
literacy to escape.

32:41.276 --> 32:43.868
Frederick Douglass had
been born into slavery,

32:44.021 --> 32:45.445
he was separated from his mother

32:45.464 --> 32:47.613
when he was about a year old.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.615
He was chosen when he was
about eight or nine years old

32:49.635 --> 32:51.359
to go to Baltimore

32:51.378 --> 32:54.137
to be the house servant
for his master's family.

32:54.364 --> 32:56.364
His mistress had never
had a slave before

32:56.383 --> 32:58.124
and didn't know that it
was illegal to teach him

32:58.143 --> 32:59.142
to read and write.

32:59.369 --> 33:01.127
And so out of the
goodness of her heart

33:01.146 --> 33:04.372
she began to teach young
Frederick his ABCs.

33:04.391 --> 33:07.726
- And the more he reads,
it's a fire in his belly.

33:07.878 --> 33:09.711
This is why they don't
want to educate the Negro,

33:09.730 --> 33:12.731
because when we become
aware, when we understand,

33:12.883 --> 33:14.992
we can no longer be enslaved.

33:15.143 --> 33:16.718
- [Kenneth] And Frederick
knew that he would one day

33:16.737 --> 33:18.662
make his attempt to escape.

33:18.813 --> 33:22.057
(horse neighing)

33:22.075 --> 33:22.833
- Fred?

33:24.003 --> 33:24.668
Fred!

33:28.656 --> 33:30.065
- You got the ticket?

33:30.083 --> 33:32.634
- Had to show em my papers
before they'd sell it to me.

33:35.072 --> 33:37.014
Straight through to
Newark, then a ferry.

33:38.759 --> 33:42.744
Listen, that's where you
have to be extra careful.

33:42.763 --> 33:45.171
They slave catches
on the lookout there.

33:45.265 --> 33:46.690
- Anna, I'll be all right.

33:48.009 --> 33:48.859
- You don't know that.

33:53.273 --> 33:56.158
Let me see your
sailor's pass again.

34:03.283 --> 34:05.876
They catch you this time
they gonna sell you south.

34:08.955 --> 34:09.713
- I have to go.

34:23.729 --> 34:27.622
- Douglass was helped by my
great, great, great grandmother,

34:27.641 --> 34:30.141
Anna Murray, who was
the first in her family

34:30.235 --> 34:31.476
to be born free.

34:31.570 --> 34:35.146
She sold a feather bed to
help finance his escape.

34:35.299 --> 34:38.075
She sold the sailors
disguise that he would wear,

34:38.226 --> 34:41.060
and he carried with him
seaman's protection papers

34:41.080 --> 34:42.704
that he had borrowed
from a friend.

34:44.399 --> 34:46.566
- [Christy] It's dangerous
because there's slave patrols

34:46.585 --> 34:48.310
looking for runaways.

34:48.403 --> 34:49.902
- There were lots
of consequences

34:49.922 --> 34:51.904
for people that
attempted to run away

34:51.998 --> 34:53.423
and that were recaptured.

34:53.575 --> 34:57.502
People would have their feet
cut off, other limbs cut off.

34:57.654 --> 34:58.837
They would have to wear

34:58.989 --> 35:01.990
these grotesque contraptions
around their necks.

35:02.083 --> 35:04.083
- Severe whipping
with a bullwhip,

35:04.103 --> 35:06.419
cutting your Achilles tendon.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.605
You can still work, can't run.

35:09.942 --> 35:11.942
And the ultimate
punishment is death.

35:19.343 --> 35:22.285
(suspenseful music)

35:59.641 --> 36:03.067
- He successfully escaped on
that train and then by boat.

36:03.220 --> 36:05.220
And he would taste
freedom for the first time

36:05.238 --> 36:06.646
in New York City.

36:06.740 --> 36:09.666
Anna would join him two weeks
later and become his wife.

36:11.670 --> 36:15.397
- In Springfield, Abraham and
Mary courted for two years.

36:15.415 --> 36:17.899
But they had kind of
a stormy courtship.

36:17.918 --> 36:19.083
Opposites attract

36:19.236 --> 36:21.419
and they were definitely
opposite in temperament.

36:21.571 --> 36:23.346
He was laconic and laid back,

36:23.573 --> 36:26.257
she was mercurial,
she was temperamental.

36:26.410 --> 36:29.001
But they decided to get married.

36:29.021 --> 36:32.522
- Meanwhile, because of the
sustained recession in Illinois,

36:32.674 --> 36:35.433
the state legislature
can't finish these projects

36:35.585 --> 36:38.436
that Lincoln has promised his
constituents he will deliver.

36:38.530 --> 36:41.180
And he shouldered the blame
and he actually said then

36:41.200 --> 36:42.257
that and that he would not run

36:42.275 --> 36:43.683
for the legislature
the next time.

36:43.777 --> 36:47.037
So it seemed like it was the
end of his political career.

36:47.188 --> 36:48.872
- Abraham and Mary were
supposed to be married

36:49.023 --> 36:53.877
on January 1st, 1841, but
Lincoln got cold feet.

36:54.713 --> 36:58.381
They broke up, he called it
the fatal 1st of January.

36:59.701 --> 37:01.943
- And now he'd
broken two promises.

37:01.962 --> 37:03.887
He broke the promise
to his constituents

37:04.038 --> 37:06.872
and he'd broken his
promise to Mary.

37:06.892 --> 37:10.285
And he said at the time that
the chief gem of his character

37:10.378 --> 37:12.395
was his ability
to keep his word,

37:12.547 --> 37:15.232
and now that he was no longer
confident he could do that,

37:15.383 --> 37:17.809
he wasn't sure he
could do anything.

37:17.903 --> 37:20.720
That's what led him into
this most profound depression

37:20.814 --> 37:22.130
that he had ever suffered.

37:22.148 --> 37:24.799
His friends worried
that he might take his life.

37:24.818 --> 37:26.818
- Joshua's Speed, his roommate,

37:26.970 --> 37:30.062
actually hides all of Lincoln's
knives and razorblades.

37:30.082 --> 37:31.748
- Meanwhile, Joshua
Speed announces

37:31.975 --> 37:33.825
that he's closing up
shop in Springfield

37:33.977 --> 37:35.493
and moving back to Kentucky.

37:35.645 --> 37:37.420
Lincoln loses his
closest friend.

37:39.258 --> 37:40.048
- You're off then?

37:42.744 --> 37:43.551
- What will you do?

37:45.989 --> 37:49.099
- I'll be better or
I'll be dead. (chuckles)

37:51.252 --> 37:52.602
Don't worry, Speed, I won't die.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.088
Haven't done anything

37:56.182 --> 37:57.899
to make anyone remember
that I ever lived.

37:58.777 --> 38:02.112
(Abe and Joshua chuckle)

38:04.524 --> 38:06.950
(soft music)

38:32.477 --> 38:35.703
- [Greg] Lincoln isn't in
such a state of depression,

38:35.797 --> 38:37.564
he can barely drag
himself out of bed.

38:39.543 --> 38:41.818
- He had been going on
such a high, in a sense,

38:41.969 --> 38:46.323
going from the fields to
political office, a lawyer,

38:46.550 --> 38:50.051
to about to marry a woman
from a very elite family.

38:50.070 --> 38:51.411
And it all comes apart.

38:52.480 --> 38:54.389
- But that drive that he'd had

38:54.407 --> 38:57.575
ever since he was a little kid,
ever since his mother died,

38:57.669 --> 39:00.895
to create something that would
allow his story to be told,

39:00.988 --> 39:02.564
saved him.

39:02.657 --> 39:04.824
He finished his term in
the state legislature.

39:04.843 --> 39:07.085
He went back to his
practice of law.

39:07.179 --> 39:09.995
He and Mary had stayed
apart for an entire year.

39:10.090 --> 39:13.741
And then finally in 1842 friends
brought them back together

39:13.760 --> 39:16.102
and they renewed their
engagement, they got married.

39:17.689 --> 39:21.265
- His ambition provided
the fuel of energy for him

39:21.418 --> 39:24.527
and his aim will next be for
the United States Congress.

39:26.514 --> 39:29.607
He is elected to
Congress as a Whig

39:29.759 --> 39:34.095
and the Whigs were bitterly
critical of the Mexican War.

39:34.114 --> 39:35.930
(horses neighing)

39:36.023 --> 39:38.950
Mexican War broke out in 1846

39:39.102 --> 39:41.603
and was widely viewed
as the pet project

39:41.696 --> 39:44.455
of democratic president
James Knox Polk.

39:44.608 --> 39:47.291
War with Mexico could
open new territory

39:47.386 --> 39:49.511
for the extension of slavery.

39:52.373 --> 39:53.781
- Going through with
that speech today?

39:53.800 --> 39:54.891
- I am.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.060
- What speech?

39:57.287 --> 39:59.044
- Lincoln wants to put
our president in his place

39:59.064 --> 40:00.230
over the Mexican War.

40:03.126 --> 40:06.736
(chains clattering)

40:06.963 --> 40:09.656
- I wouldn't do that,
the president's popular.

40:12.152 --> 40:13.159
Don't poke the bear.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.971
- But what if the bear is wrong.

40:17.064 --> 40:18.489
President Polk provoked this war

40:18.642 --> 40:20.232
'cause he wants California
and the whole west

40:20.252 --> 40:21.993
and he wants them
as slave states.

40:22.087 --> 40:24.328
(horses neighing)

40:24.481 --> 40:26.664
Slave power's got
to be reigned in.

40:26.758 --> 40:27.424
That's the end of it.

40:27.651 --> 40:28.550
- We agree.

40:29.986 --> 40:31.819
But if you make a speech
against the president

40:31.838 --> 40:34.597
before the fighting's even
over, you'll be crucified.

40:35.583 --> 40:36.558
And for what?

40:41.422 --> 40:43.681
- Lincoln makes a
speech in Congress

40:43.833 --> 40:45.667
denouncing President Polk

40:45.685 --> 40:49.612
for a triggering the Mexican
War on false pretenses.

40:49.764 --> 40:52.282
- The war was
incredibly popular.

40:52.509 --> 40:54.433
The United States won
a huge amount of land,

40:54.453 --> 40:57.269
including future
states of California

40:57.363 --> 40:59.530
and New Mexico and Arizona.

40:59.683 --> 41:01.699
So the Democrats use
that against Lincoln

41:01.793 --> 41:04.961
to basically try and paint
him as not being patriotic.

41:05.188 --> 41:07.522
- [Allen] The speech
backfired on Lincoln

41:07.540 --> 41:09.090
and he suffered for it.

41:10.360 --> 41:12.719
(soft music)

41:20.370 --> 41:21.644
- Can't have been so bad.

41:31.323 --> 41:32.739
- I won't talk about it.

41:45.395 --> 41:47.587
(Abe sighs)

41:49.174 --> 41:52.567
- It might not have been wise
to have made that speech,

41:52.585 --> 41:53.635
but it needed to be said.

41:55.739 --> 41:57.496
Presidents can just go to
war because they want to,

41:57.516 --> 41:58.640
it's outrageous.

42:00.352 --> 42:01.309
- Well

42:03.170 --> 42:06.105
- I'm afraid this might
be my one and only term.

42:08.175 --> 42:09.776
- You'll make other speeches.

42:10.920 --> 42:13.112
(Abe sighs)

42:16.701 --> 42:17.534
I know you will.

42:19.095 --> 42:22.038
(soft music)

42:22.189 --> 42:24.857
- At the end of 1849,
he's a lame duck,

42:24.951 --> 42:27.101
he comes back to
Springfield, Illinois,

42:27.120 --> 42:30.696
very dispirited,
he's out of politics.

42:30.715 --> 42:33.941
- He felt like a failure,
he wasn't popular.

42:33.960 --> 42:35.868
He embarrassed himself.

42:35.962 --> 42:38.446
- [Harold] So he
turns back to the law,

42:38.464 --> 42:41.724
traveling the big eighth
judicial circuit in Illinois.

42:43.061 --> 42:45.970
- He was quite happy
early in his marriage.

42:46.064 --> 42:49.307
They had a nice home on
Jackson Street in Springfield.

42:49.401 --> 42:53.294
He had two children at that
time, Robert and Edward.

42:53.387 --> 42:55.129
- And as Lincoln
is practicing law

42:55.148 --> 42:57.056
and making a reputation
for himself,

42:57.150 --> 43:00.910
the country is increasingly
having to deal with slavery.

43:02.322 --> 43:05.139
- [Christy] The issue
is dividing the nation.

43:05.158 --> 43:07.083
- The slave holding south

43:07.310 --> 43:09.811
wants to to not only
maintain slavery,

43:09.904 --> 43:12.496
but also be able
to expand it west

43:12.591 --> 43:14.498
into those territories
that have been acquired

43:14.651 --> 43:16.334
through the war with Mexico.

43:16.486 --> 43:18.986
- And then the Fugitive
Slave Act of 1850

43:19.080 --> 43:21.413
says northern states
have an obligation

43:21.507 --> 43:24.083
to return slaves that have fled

43:24.102 --> 43:26.085
from the south into the north.

43:26.104 --> 43:28.996
And the north is up in arms,
they are absolutely livid.

43:29.090 --> 43:30.498
- People are being kidnapped,

43:30.591 --> 43:32.609
bounty hunters are
going into the north

43:32.760 --> 43:34.277
and capturing free people,

43:34.504 --> 43:36.354
whether they've been free
for generations or not,

43:36.506 --> 43:38.522
it just is if you got
a random black person

43:38.617 --> 43:41.767
and I can get to 'em, I can
capture them and take them away.

43:41.786 --> 43:43.435
Lincoln is aware of all this.

43:43.529 --> 43:44.787
- At the same time,

43:45.014 --> 43:47.606
the abolitionists they're
agitating against slavery

43:47.700 --> 43:49.792
through the formation
of societies,

43:49.944 --> 43:52.019
publication of newspapers,

43:52.038 --> 43:54.446
the lecturers that are
going about the country,

43:54.466 --> 43:56.966
whipping folks up
against slavery.

43:57.118 --> 43:58.951
- The most important
abolitionists

43:59.045 --> 44:00.970
are formerly enslaved
men and women.

44:01.197 --> 44:04.715
What better way to
describe slavery

44:04.868 --> 44:06.884
than someone like a
Frederick Douglass.

44:06.978 --> 44:08.703
- After escaping from slavery,

44:08.721 --> 44:11.389
Frederick Douglass wrote
his first autobiography.

44:11.483 --> 44:14.208
It became a bestseller,
made him a household name.

44:14.301 --> 44:16.377
It made him an
instant celebrity,

44:16.470 --> 44:18.905
and he joined the
anti-slavery lecture circuit.

44:21.718 --> 44:27.163
- What to the American
slave is your 4th of July?

44:29.893 --> 44:33.561
I answer, a day
that reveals to him

44:33.579 --> 44:36.321
more than all other
days in the year,

44:36.416 --> 44:39.917
the gross injustice and cruelty

44:40.069 --> 44:43.328
to which he is the
constant victim.

44:43.348 --> 44:46.832
To him, your
celebration is a sham.

44:46.851 --> 44:52.939
Your shouts of liberty and
equality, hollow mockery.

44:53.858 --> 44:55.841
Your sermons and Thanksgivings

44:55.860 --> 44:58.861
with all their religious
parade and solemnity

44:59.088 --> 45:03.274
are to him mere, bombast,
fraud, deception,

45:03.368 --> 45:05.451
impiety and hypocrisy.

45:06.687 --> 45:08.779
A thin veil to cover up crimes

45:08.932 --> 45:12.024
which would disgrace
a nation of savages.

45:12.043 --> 45:15.194
There's not a
nation on this earth

45:15.213 --> 45:19.198
guilty of practices
more shocking and bloody

45:19.217 --> 45:22.293
than are the people
of these United States

45:22.387 --> 45:24.870
at this very hour.

45:24.889 --> 45:27.724
(dramatic music)

45:27.951 --> 45:30.852
(audience applauds)

45:40.313 --> 45:41.979
- If it's all right by you,

45:42.131 --> 45:43.072
I'll just remind you of a few
of the facts of this case.

45:44.150 --> 45:45.891
Poor Mr. Fleming,

45:45.910 --> 45:48.745
he almost got burnt in a fire,

45:48.896 --> 45:51.414
and his legs, they were
broken, getting away.

45:53.067 --> 45:56.327
Now, Mr. Fleming, he begged
the doctor to fix him up

45:56.479 --> 45:58.996
and well, my client obliged.

45:59.090 --> 46:01.482
But now Fleming is complaining

46:01.501 --> 46:03.667
that one of his
legs didn't straight

46:03.820 --> 46:05.344
and that it's the
doctor's fault.

46:06.931 --> 46:10.749
And I do, I reckon that's his
right, to complain, I mean.

46:10.769 --> 46:13.252
- Lincoln was an
extraordinarily good lawyer.

46:13.346 --> 46:15.420
When he was in front of a jury,

46:15.440 --> 46:18.274
he sort of was just having
a conversation with them.

46:18.425 --> 46:22.003
- Usually judge David Davis
was the presiding judge.

46:22.096 --> 46:23.762
He became a good
friend of Lincoln's.

46:23.782 --> 46:26.115
- Your honor, may I
perform a demonstration?

46:30.604 --> 46:32.789
This is the bone
of a young chicken.

46:38.797 --> 46:39.629
Pretty flexible.

46:41.633 --> 46:43.299
Probably heal pretty
good if injured.

46:45.637 --> 46:48.471
Now this is the bone of one
that's done some living.

46:52.977 --> 46:55.536
(audience murmurs)

46:55.629 --> 46:57.721
Your honor, may I ask
the plaintiff to stand?

46:57.874 --> 46:58.648
- [Judge] Stand up.

47:02.153 --> 47:03.319
- Gentlemen of the jury,

47:05.639 --> 47:09.408
I think you'll all agree
that Mr. Fleming here is,

47:10.811 --> 47:12.219
well, he's no spring chicken.

47:12.238 --> 47:15.556
(audience laughs)

47:15.649 --> 47:18.000
- I ain't none kinda chicken.

47:18.152 --> 47:20.152
- But you are complaining
that you now have a limp

47:20.246 --> 47:22.004
and you want some money for it.

47:22.231 --> 47:23.564
Now, if it were me,

47:23.583 --> 47:27.176
I'd get down on my knees and
thank my heavenly father.

47:27.403 --> 47:32.014
And also this doctor for
legs to stand on at all.

47:32.758 --> 47:35.017
(crowd murmurs)

47:36.503 --> 47:38.187
Thank you, judge,
nothing further.

47:40.750 --> 47:44.176
- Lincoln is so good
at persuading a jury,

47:44.195 --> 47:46.253
he's almost imagining
that he's really had

47:46.347 --> 47:49.273
his political game for his life.

47:49.425 --> 47:51.592
It's about as far as
he's likely to get.

47:51.685 --> 47:53.369
- He was very well-respected.

47:53.596 --> 47:56.188
He established the most
successful law practice

47:56.282 --> 47:57.540
in central Illinois.

47:57.691 --> 48:01.210
- Lincoln's able to make
a good living, ride circuit,

48:01.437 --> 48:03.771
and tell tall tales
and tell funny stories.

48:03.789 --> 48:07.199
He's got this self-deprecating
humor and folksy charm

48:07.293 --> 48:09.368
combined with a high intellect.

48:09.462 --> 48:10.720
That's a pretty
potent combination.

48:10.871 --> 48:12.221
- He's reading philosophy,

48:12.448 --> 48:13.797
he's reading history
and literature.

48:13.892 --> 48:15.558
He's growing his mind.

48:15.709 --> 48:17.451
- And then
Stephen A. Douglas,

48:17.544 --> 48:18.895
Lincoln's long time rival,

48:19.122 --> 48:20.971
United States,
Senator from Illinois,

48:21.065 --> 48:24.233
introduced a law in 1854

48:24.385 --> 48:28.220
that he thought would end
slavery agitation forever.

48:28.239 --> 48:30.814
And it was called the
Kansas Nebraska Act.

48:30.967 --> 48:33.058
- The Kansas Nebraska Act

48:33.077 --> 48:36.153
says the new territories
of Kansas Nebraska,

48:36.247 --> 48:37.413
when they come into the union

48:37.640 --> 48:40.658
can choose themselves
by popular sovereignty

48:40.810 --> 48:41.825
whether they want to come in

48:41.978 --> 48:44.253
as a free state
or a slave state.

48:44.405 --> 48:45.588
- With this act,

48:45.739 --> 48:48.090
the balance between free
states and enslave states

48:48.317 --> 48:50.484
is going to be
thrown into jeopardy.

48:50.577 --> 48:52.820
Since the Missouri
Compromise of 1820,

48:52.913 --> 48:55.247
northerners thought
slavery will never

48:55.266 --> 48:57.992
be north of the southern
border of Missouri.

48:58.010 --> 49:01.845
Now, potentially there could
be even more slave states

49:01.998 --> 49:04.165
and they will have
even more power.

49:04.183 --> 49:06.425
- And that's just
unacceptable, to Lincoln.

49:06.444 --> 49:08.945
Rather than reduce and
ultimately eliminate

49:09.172 --> 49:11.021
the existence of slavery
in this country over time,

49:11.174 --> 49:12.597
which is how
Lincoln imagined it,

49:12.692 --> 49:15.034
this might allow
slavery's power to grow.

49:16.437 --> 49:18.512
- [Harold] But he's
out of politics.

49:18.531 --> 49:21.031
He's still on the road
throughout his judicial circuit,

49:21.184 --> 49:24.185
making friends
and telling jokes.

49:24.278 --> 49:26.203
- So we stayed
with this old lady.

49:26.297 --> 49:27.446
Now, this fella',

49:27.540 --> 49:30.024
he loved anything to
do with our revolution

49:30.042 --> 49:32.860
and he venerated any
artifacts he found.

49:32.878 --> 49:35.454
So when he had heard
that this old woman

49:35.473 --> 49:37.622
still had a dress that
she'd worn during that time,

49:37.642 --> 49:40.701
oh, he begged her
to bring it out.

49:40.720 --> 49:44.796
Well, the lady, she takes out
this dusty dress from a trunk

49:44.890 --> 49:47.708
and this fella is so excited

49:47.801 --> 49:49.735
that he oh so
tenderly kisses it.

49:51.380 --> 49:54.306
Well, he old woman
watches this and she says,

49:54.325 --> 49:56.826
mister, if you want
to kiss something old,

49:56.977 --> 49:58.810
why don't you kiss my ass?

49:58.830 --> 50:01.572
It's 16 years older
than that dress.

50:01.666 --> 50:04.417
(friends laughing)

50:06.504 --> 50:10.064
- Evening edition, the
Kansas Nebraska Act,

50:10.082 --> 50:10.840
they passed it.

50:13.344 --> 50:15.586
- There goes the compromise.
- Good riddance.

50:15.680 --> 50:17.179
- No, Douglas is a fool!

50:18.182 --> 50:19.423
- Let the people decide.

50:19.575 --> 50:22.243
- You're talking rubbish!
- This is a democracy!

50:22.261 --> 50:25.021
(friends arguing)

50:26.415 --> 50:29.083
- [Harold] Lincoln
was outraged by this.

50:29.176 --> 50:31.252
- There comes a point for him

50:31.270 --> 50:35.865
when morality and the idea of
the expansion of human dignity

50:37.610 --> 50:38.868
takes the fore.

50:42.874 --> 50:43.789
- Abe?

50:47.027 --> 50:51.047
- Judge, you say that A
is white and B is black.

50:52.550 --> 50:55.551
So, it's color that
dictates that hierarchy?

50:58.056 --> 51:00.631
- Abe, it's five in the morning.

51:00.783 --> 51:01.891
You've been up all night?

51:03.210 --> 51:04.285
- I've got to start
at the beginning

51:04.378 --> 51:06.395
in order to see this
through to the end.

51:08.624 --> 51:10.066
That's what this is
all about, isn't it?

51:11.736 --> 51:14.070
A lighter man having the
right to enslave the darker?

51:16.148 --> 51:20.150
By that rule, you oughta be
slave to the first man you meet

51:20.303 --> 51:22.078
with a fairer skin
than your own.

51:22.305 --> 51:24.305
- That's not all there is
to it, and you know it.

51:24.398 --> 51:25.989
- So it's not just
color that justifies

51:26.142 --> 51:27.991
one man owning another?

51:28.086 --> 51:31.236
- There are other ways a man
might be superior to another.

51:31.330 --> 51:34.148
- You're saying that whites
are intellectually superior?

51:34.166 --> 51:36.741
And so they have a
right to enslave blacks?

51:36.761 --> 51:38.652
Follow that rule and
you're bound to be slave

51:38.745 --> 51:40.930
to the first man you meet
that's smarter than you.

51:42.491 --> 51:44.082
- Well, then I'm your
slave, Abe. (chuckles)

51:44.102 --> 51:45.008
- No.

51:45.161 --> 51:46.327
- Unless you are fool enough

51:46.420 --> 51:48.938
to think you can figure
it all out in one night.

51:50.333 --> 51:51.941
- But it has got
to be figured out.

51:55.262 --> 51:56.028
Can't you see?

51:58.282 --> 51:59.281
This, this Kansas Act,

52:01.268 --> 52:03.619
just opened the door to
slavery in every single state.

52:05.681 --> 52:07.790
Gonna be a big argument
in this country, judge.

52:09.368 --> 52:10.626
I intend to be ready for it.

52:12.797 --> 52:14.946
(crowd shouting)

52:14.966 --> 52:17.716
(dramatic music)

52:32.483 --> 52:35.234
(crowd shouting)

52:39.806 --> 52:42.641
(glass shattering)

52:42.660 --> 52:43.576
(blows thudding)

52:47.498 --> 52:47.830
(blows thudding)

52:52.912 --> 52:57.798
(crowd shouting)
(blows thudding)

53:00.678 --> 53:01.468
Get him!

53:06.667 --> 53:08.517
- Call it Bleeding Kansas.

53:08.669 --> 53:10.835
That Kansas Nebraska
Act kicks open

53:10.930 --> 53:13.355
the door to slavery
existing anywhere

53:13.507 --> 53:16.192
and that leads to
serious bloodshed.

53:16.343 --> 53:19.361
- Most settlers want
Kansas to be a free state,

53:19.513 --> 53:21.271
but border ruffians
from Missouri,

53:21.365 --> 53:26.202
which was a slave state, invade
Kansas and steal elections

53:27.187 --> 53:28.687
to try to make it a slave state.

53:28.781 --> 53:30.873
There's a full
fledged war going on.

53:32.710 --> 53:34.693
- For Lincoln, the young lawyer,

53:34.787 --> 53:38.863
there's this series of
events from 1850 through 1860

53:38.958 --> 53:41.217
that are going to sharply shape

53:41.444 --> 53:43.777
his thinking about what's
happening to his country.

53:43.870 --> 53:45.629
- There's the
fugitive slave law,

53:45.723 --> 53:47.706
there's the Kansas Nebraska Act,

53:47.725 --> 53:50.284
there's the Dred Scott decision.

53:50.302 --> 53:53.136
- Dred Scott is an
enslaved man in Missouri

53:53.289 --> 53:56.640
who was taken to a free state,
so he sues for his freedom

53:56.792 --> 53:59.643
on the basis of having
been in a free state.

53:59.737 --> 54:01.403
And this case goes all the way

54:01.555 --> 54:03.797
to the United States
Supreme Court.

54:03.890 --> 54:06.316
- The Dred Scott decision
essentially says that,

54:06.410 --> 54:09.912
black Americans, if they're
enslaved their property, period,

54:10.139 --> 54:12.639
and therefore they don't
have a right to suit.

54:12.658 --> 54:15.066
- The Supreme Court
ruled that black people

54:15.160 --> 54:17.902
had never been and could not be

54:17.922 --> 54:19.997
citizens of the United States.

54:20.149 --> 54:21.573
So blacks have no rights,

54:21.667 --> 54:24.743
which white men are
bound to respect.

54:24.837 --> 54:27.245
- Which leads us to John Brown.

54:27.265 --> 54:30.674
John Brown is an
abolitionist zealot.

54:30.768 --> 54:34.770
He settled in Kansas and he
believes through his faith

54:34.997 --> 54:38.499
that it is his calling and
his purpose in this life

54:38.517 --> 54:44.171
to end the atrocity of
slavery in the United States,

54:44.264 --> 54:46.356
because it's an
antithesis to God.

54:46.509 --> 54:50.861
- John Brown was either
a maniac or a saint.

54:50.955 --> 54:55.106
He was a white man who cared
enough about black freedom

54:55.126 --> 54:59.277
to try to start a revolution.

54:59.297 --> 55:02.372
And in Kansas, John
Brown hacked to death

55:02.466 --> 55:04.591
five pro slavery men.

55:06.362 --> 55:08.378
- Lincoln saw that all
these series of events

55:08.531 --> 55:10.380
divided the country.

55:10.533 --> 55:12.199
It divided every party.

55:12.217 --> 55:15.202
The Whig Party divides
between the anti-slavery Whigs

55:15.295 --> 55:16.461
and the pro-slavery Whigs.

55:16.555 --> 55:17.813
The Democratic Party divides

55:17.964 --> 55:19.556
between the
anti-slavery Democrats

55:19.650 --> 55:21.375
and the pro-slavery Democrats.

55:21.393 --> 55:22.967
The Whig Party eventually
is gonna collapse

55:23.062 --> 55:24.227
as a result of this.

55:24.322 --> 55:26.655
And out of this comes
the New Republican Party.

55:28.308 --> 55:30.717
- This new party,
this Republican Party,

55:30.811 --> 55:33.662
begins in earnest
in the early 1850s

55:33.814 --> 55:36.239
and its platform
isn't anti-slavery,

55:36.334 --> 55:40.002
it's no extension of slavery
into the western territories.

55:40.229 --> 55:42.896
- But there are radical
Republicans who say,

55:42.915 --> 55:47.826
slavery is vile, evil, we
need to get rid of slavery.

55:48.571 --> 55:51.071
- In the late 1850s, the
rhetoric within Congress

55:51.164 --> 55:53.832
was becoming increasingly hot.

55:53.926 --> 55:56.093
Charles Sumner of Massachusetts

55:56.187 --> 55:59.671
was one of the radical wing
of the Republican Party.

55:59.690 --> 56:02.933
He had made a speech called
"The Crime against Kansas"

56:03.085 --> 56:04.585
on the floor of Congress,

56:04.603 --> 56:07.178
where he used very
salacious language

56:07.272 --> 56:10.366
about a US Senator from South
Carolina named Andrew Butler.

56:11.777 --> 56:12.868
- Senator Sumner,

56:14.372 --> 56:18.207
you have impugn the honor of
my cousin, Senator Butler.

56:19.602 --> 56:23.712
- All I've done is told
the world the truth,

56:23.939 --> 56:27.007
that your cousin backs
the hideous Kansas Act

56:28.719 --> 56:32.721
and he has a mistress who
he obeys without question.

56:36.209 --> 56:41.230
An ugly mistress,
whose name is slavery.

56:46.070 --> 56:48.737
(blows thudding)

57:04.480 --> 57:06.255
- Sumner's carried
out unconscious,

57:06.482 --> 57:08.590
unable to return to the
Senate for three years.

57:09.835 --> 57:11.334
After the caning of Sumner,

57:11.429 --> 57:13.929
in the north there is
a visceral reaction

57:14.080 --> 57:16.673
to an attack right
in the Capitol.

57:16.825 --> 57:18.175
Rallies are formed,

57:18.269 --> 57:21.511
mass numbers of people begin
to join the Republican Party.

57:21.664 --> 57:23.013
Meanwhile, in the
south, however,

57:23.165 --> 57:25.107
Preston Brooks
has become a hero.

57:25.258 --> 57:27.091
People start
carrying canes around

57:27.111 --> 57:28.927
as if they're gonna
attack somebody.

57:28.946 --> 57:30.671
The split between the
north and the south

57:30.764 --> 57:32.597
goes deeper and
deeper and deeper.

57:32.616 --> 57:34.841
- Lincoln's so unsettled
by what's happening

57:34.935 --> 57:37.286
that he decides, I need
to be a part of this.

57:37.513 --> 57:40.438
This is an ambition he
had since he was young

57:40.458 --> 57:43.684
to be a part of something
that was bigger than himself.

57:43.702 --> 57:46.128
- He may have been somewhat
content being a lawyer,

57:46.355 --> 57:48.538
but he obviously still
had the political bug.

57:48.632 --> 57:50.040
He still had the itch.

57:50.134 --> 57:52.542
- Lincoln helped form the
Republican Party in Illinois.

57:52.636 --> 57:55.378
And he becomes the
leading candidate in 1858

57:55.473 --> 57:57.121
for the next Senate run,

57:57.141 --> 57:59.533
running against Stephen Douglas,

57:59.626 --> 58:02.536
who was not only now
already a Senator,

58:02.554 --> 58:05.296
but he's the presumptive
presidential candidate in 1860

58:05.390 --> 58:07.465
for the Democratic Party.

58:07.485 --> 58:09.226
- Lincoln gives an
acceptance speech

58:09.320 --> 58:12.136
and it's the most radical
thing he's ever said.

58:12.231 --> 58:14.898
And his friends,
hearing him rehearse it,

58:14.992 --> 58:17.384
had begged him not to
deliver that speech.

58:17.477 --> 58:19.886
They thought it
would end his career.

58:19.905 --> 58:22.889
- Lincoln's speech
uses a biblical phrase

58:22.908 --> 58:27.669
from the book of Mark, calling
America a house divided.

58:27.896 --> 58:31.006
- He declares, a house
divided shall not stand.

58:31.157 --> 58:33.750
We can't have a nation that's
half slave and half free.

58:33.902 --> 58:36.828
It does mark a turning
point in his mind.

58:36.847 --> 58:39.831
He recognizes that in
his political life,

58:39.850 --> 58:41.683
he's gonna have to
object to slavery

58:41.835 --> 58:44.520
in a way that is tougher
and more controversial.

58:46.172 --> 58:48.582
- Lincoln begins to
campaign through the state

58:48.600 --> 58:52.010
and invites Douglas to a
series of joint debates.

58:52.029 --> 58:53.270
Douglas writes back and says,

58:53.364 --> 58:55.864
I'm under no obligation
to meet jointly with you.

58:56.016 --> 58:57.424
I'm the incumbent Senator,

58:57.517 --> 59:01.444
I'm the most famous politician
in America at this moment.

59:01.539 --> 59:04.614
Why am I going to give you
space on a platform with me?

59:04.767 --> 59:05.832
But Douglas can't resist.

59:06.877 --> 59:09.211
(audience cheers and applauds)

59:09.362 --> 59:11.955
- How you doing, everyone?

59:12.107 --> 59:14.365
Thank you so much
for coming out.

59:14.459 --> 59:15.551
I Appreciate you.

59:15.778 --> 59:17.778
- [Doris] Douglas comes
in as the champion.

59:17.871 --> 59:20.538
He comes in to train with
a special car decorated.

59:20.558 --> 59:22.465
He comes with servants
and his secretaries.

59:22.618 --> 59:25.727
- Mayor, good to see you.

59:25.879 --> 59:26.953
- [Doris] And
Lincoln has to walk

59:26.972 --> 59:28.355
from one debate to another.

59:29.975 --> 59:32.459
The reputation of
Lincoln and Douglas

59:32.477 --> 59:33.694
were both on the line here.

59:35.314 --> 59:36.888
- [Christy] They
literally are setting up

59:36.982 --> 59:39.741
the conflict in the nation.

59:39.893 --> 59:42.369
(bright music)

59:51.422 --> 59:54.089
- Now I've known Lincoln from
when we were both young men,

59:54.316 --> 59:57.500
and no one can compete
with him in wrestling,

59:57.595 --> 1:00:03.156
or a foot race or on whiskey
in his grocery store.

1:00:03.175 --> 1:00:05.434
(audience laughs)

1:00:05.661 --> 1:00:08.419
We served on the state
legislature together.

1:00:08.439 --> 1:00:12.757
And then Mr. Lincoln
submerged for a time,

1:00:12.776 --> 1:00:17.354
until he reappeared in the
hallowed halls of Congress,

1:00:17.448 --> 1:00:19.948
where he distinguished himself

1:00:20.175 --> 1:00:24.102
by his opposition to
the war with Mexico.

1:00:24.196 --> 1:00:28.915
Taking the side of the common
enemy against his own country.

1:00:29.868 --> 1:00:31.701
(audience boos)

1:00:31.854 --> 1:00:33.587
And he, again, submerged.

1:00:34.857 --> 1:00:38.358
He came up again in 1854,

1:00:38.451 --> 1:00:41.452
this time in cahoots
with Fred Douglass

1:00:41.472 --> 1:00:44.214
and his abolitionist friends,

1:00:44.308 --> 1:00:49.627
just in time to create this
black Republican platform.

1:00:49.721 --> 1:00:51.221
(audience boos)

1:00:51.373 --> 1:00:54.298
- That's right,
Douglas, hit him again.

1:00:54.393 --> 1:00:55.542
- Lincoln you're two faced!

1:00:55.560 --> 1:00:57.878
(audience laughs)

1:00:57.896 --> 1:01:00.730
- If I had two faces you
think I'd be wearing this one?

1:01:00.824 --> 1:01:04.660
(audience laughs and applauds)

1:01:06.388 --> 1:01:08.738
- [Doris] This old
rivalry has come to roost.

1:01:08.891 --> 1:01:10.148
- Very good, very good.

1:01:10.242 --> 1:01:12.742
- Lincoln felt that his
life had been a flat failure

1:01:12.836 --> 1:01:14.227
compared to Douglas's.

1:01:14.320 --> 1:01:16.579
Douglas had gotten
further than he had,

1:01:16.674 --> 1:01:19.900
and now they're running against
each other for the Senate.

1:01:19.918 --> 1:01:22.994
- Now, I am no giant
like judge Douglas.

1:01:23.088 --> 1:01:24.421
(audience laughs)

1:01:24.515 --> 1:01:25.263
I'm a mere mortal.

1:01:26.909 --> 1:01:29.643
No, his ambition, it
far exceeds my own.

1:01:31.355 --> 1:01:33.522
His party, they all expect
him to be president one day.

1:01:34.099 --> 1:01:35.582
(Crowd agreeing)

1:01:35.675 --> 1:01:37.859
And then they will all reap
the benefits of his greatness.

1:01:38.011 --> 1:01:39.269
(Crowd agreeing)

1:01:39.421 --> 1:01:43.273
But nobody has ever looked
at my lean, lank face

1:01:43.367 --> 1:01:45.516
and expected me to be president.

1:01:45.610 --> 1:01:46.426
(audience laughs)

1:01:46.519 --> 1:01:47.594
- People come to these debates

1:01:47.687 --> 1:01:50.521
with all the fervent
love and attention

1:01:50.541 --> 1:01:53.767
that they would bring to a
giant sporting event today.

1:01:53.860 --> 1:01:54.859
But these were more important

1:01:54.953 --> 1:01:57.454
than any sporting
event could have been.

1:01:57.606 --> 1:02:00.790
- I am here to talk
about basic principles.

1:02:00.884 --> 1:02:02.609
(Crowd agreeing)

1:02:02.627 --> 1:02:04.845
Now, if the Negro is a man,

1:02:06.131 --> 1:02:07.705
while then my ancient
faith teaches me

1:02:07.799 --> 1:02:09.132
that all men are created equal,

1:02:09.226 --> 1:02:10.283
(Crowd agreeing)

1:02:10.376 --> 1:02:13.544
And that there can
be no moral right

1:02:13.638 --> 1:02:16.881
in connection with one man
making a slave of another.

1:02:16.900 --> 1:02:20.694
(audience cheers and applauds)

1:02:22.481 --> 1:02:25.073
- Now let's talk
about principle.

1:02:26.744 --> 1:02:31.037
I care more for the great
principle of self government,

1:02:32.065 --> 1:02:33.415
the right of the people to rule,

1:02:33.566 --> 1:02:36.993
than I do for all the
Negros in Christiandom.

1:02:37.087 --> 1:02:38.569
(Audience applauding)

1:02:38.663 --> 1:02:42.816
- When a white man governs
himself, that is self-governed.

1:02:42.834 --> 1:02:44.742
But when he governed himself

1:02:44.762 --> 1:02:47.245
and he also governs another man,

1:02:47.264 --> 1:02:50.657
that is more than self
government, there is despotism.

1:02:50.750 --> 1:02:52.842
(audience cheers and applauds)

1:02:52.995 --> 1:02:58.498
- Mr. Lincoln and his ilk want
Negro equality in all things.

1:02:58.517 --> 1:02:59.516
(audience boos)

1:02:59.610 --> 1:03:02.110
If they get their way,

1:03:02.262 --> 1:03:06.673
Negroes and whites will
be permitted to marry.

1:03:06.691 --> 1:03:07.507
(audience boos)

1:03:07.600 --> 1:03:11.011
Negroes will serve on juries.

1:03:11.029 --> 1:03:12.362
(audience boos)

1:03:12.456 --> 1:03:14.347
Negroes will vote.

1:03:14.366 --> 1:03:16.182
(audience boos)

1:03:16.201 --> 1:03:17.292
- During these debates,

1:03:17.443 --> 1:03:21.204
Lincoln's not an
abolitionist by any stretch,

1:03:21.356 --> 1:03:24.541
but he's inadvertently
making their arguments

1:03:24.693 --> 1:03:28.528
as he's looking for logic

1:03:28.621 --> 1:03:31.473
in the constitutionality
of all this.

1:03:31.700 --> 1:03:35.143
- And he goes way
back to Euclid.

1:03:35.370 --> 1:03:37.795
Euclid is very much about
how you prove something

1:03:37.815 --> 1:03:40.540
beyond any shadow of a doubt.

1:03:40.559 --> 1:03:44.727
And he's working toward crushing
the fallacious arguments

1:03:44.822 --> 1:03:45.987
on behalf of slavery.

1:03:47.473 --> 1:03:49.473
- But like most
people of the day,

1:03:49.493 --> 1:03:51.809
he absolutely fervently believes

1:03:51.903 --> 1:03:53.720
that black people are inferior,

1:03:53.813 --> 1:03:55.497
and whether they're
enslaved or freed.

1:03:57.167 --> 1:04:00.560
- Just because I believe
the Negro should be free,

1:04:00.653 --> 1:04:03.396
does not mean that
I want to marry one.

1:04:03.415 --> 1:04:05.656
(audience laughs)

1:04:05.676 --> 1:04:09.660
As a nation, we
began by declaring

1:04:09.754 --> 1:04:11.680
that all men are created equal.

1:04:13.758 --> 1:04:17.410
We now practically read it
all men are created equal,

1:04:17.429 --> 1:04:19.429
except Negroes.

1:04:19.581 --> 1:04:23.007
Soon it will read, all
men are created equal

1:04:23.026 --> 1:04:26.436
except Negroes and
foreigners and Catholics.

1:04:26.530 --> 1:04:28.679
(Crowd agreeing)

1:04:28.699 --> 1:04:31.324
Negroes, like many other men,

1:04:32.611 --> 1:04:35.203
may not be equal in all things.

1:04:35.430 --> 1:04:37.521
But if they are men,

1:04:37.541 --> 1:04:40.375
they are entitled to their right

1:04:40.526 --> 1:04:43.861
to life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness.

1:04:43.881 --> 1:04:47.716
(audience cheers and applauds)

1:04:50.888 --> 1:04:54.297
The real issue, which
will last long after

1:04:54.449 --> 1:04:57.133
the tongues of judge
Douglas and I are silent,

1:04:57.227 --> 1:05:00.896
is the eternal struggle
between these two principles,

1:05:01.732 --> 1:05:05.141
between right and wrong.

1:05:05.235 --> 1:05:09.070
(audience cheers and applauds)

1:05:14.894 --> 1:05:16.803
- What Lincoln
does so brilliantly

1:05:16.896 --> 1:05:19.414
is he takes that core language

1:05:19.565 --> 1:05:21.658
of the Declaration
of Independence

1:05:21.810 --> 1:05:25.253
and turns it into a
nation's moral compass.

1:05:26.815 --> 1:05:29.315
And he couples that
with constitutionality.

1:05:29.334 --> 1:05:31.651
And he couples that
with scripture,

1:05:31.744 --> 1:05:34.763
he has a really
powerful argument.

1:05:36.174 --> 1:05:38.249
- This is where
Lincoln makes his name.

1:05:38.343 --> 1:05:40.510
One debate after another.

1:05:40.604 --> 1:05:43.754
Everything had prepared him
for the repertoire of talents

1:05:43.774 --> 1:05:45.848
that he was able to
show in these debates.

1:05:46.001 --> 1:05:48.610
He's telling
stories, he's funny.

1:05:48.761 --> 1:05:51.446
He can talk philosophically,
he can talk politically.

1:05:52.932 --> 1:05:54.524
- The Lincoln Douglas
debates helped Lincoln,

1:05:54.618 --> 1:05:58.511
it raised his profile,
lifted him up a lot.

1:05:58.604 --> 1:06:00.080
But he loses the election.

1:06:02.108 --> 1:06:04.608
- One of the things about
Lincoln that's amazing

1:06:04.628 --> 1:06:08.755
is that he loses a lot,
but the great ones in life

1:06:10.041 --> 1:06:12.968
take a loss and they come back.

1:06:14.454 --> 1:06:16.787
- Even though he
loses this election,

1:06:16.881 --> 1:06:21.292
once again the loss becomes
a platform for him to grow.

1:06:21.311 --> 1:06:24.646
Underlying it all is there's
a passion that he has,

1:06:24.873 --> 1:06:27.315
a passion for that
cause of antislavery,

1:06:27.467 --> 1:06:29.300
which is coming to a head.

1:06:29.319 --> 1:06:32.112
(dramatic music)

1:06:35.900 --> 1:06:40.829
- In 1859, John Brown,
who left Kansas.

1:06:41.723 --> 1:06:44.315
He and his small band of
people, blacks and whites,

1:06:44.334 --> 1:06:46.059
many of them his own children,

1:06:46.077 --> 1:06:48.986
went into what was
then Western Virginia

1:06:49.006 --> 1:06:50.654
to a town called Harper's Ferry,

1:06:50.674 --> 1:06:54.175
which was a federal armory,
to attack the arsenal.

1:06:55.345 --> 1:06:57.403
He's trying to organize an
army of interracial folks

1:06:57.497 --> 1:07:00.331
to go into the south,
arm the slaves,

1:07:00.350 --> 1:07:02.684
and destroy the slave system.

1:07:02.911 --> 1:07:05.669
- Those who would not join
him, like Frederick Douglass,

1:07:05.689 --> 1:07:09.916
gave him moral support
and gave him funds.

1:07:10.009 --> 1:07:12.268
- [Richard] The
attack was a disaster.

1:07:12.362 --> 1:07:15.530
- [Edna] John Brown was
captured and executed

1:07:15.681 --> 1:07:17.699
and he sacrificed
two of his sons.

1:07:20.262 --> 1:07:23.371
- In the south there
is an absolute fear

1:07:23.523 --> 1:07:26.432
that there are more John
Browns out there lurking.

1:07:26.526 --> 1:07:29.269
The thought of a
massive slave rebellion

1:07:29.287 --> 1:07:31.287
unhinged white southerners.

1:07:31.381 --> 1:07:34.865
And so we start to see
more talks about secession.

1:07:34.959 --> 1:07:38.461
Meanwhile, many people in
the north celebrated Brown.

1:07:38.613 --> 1:07:39.888
Church bells are tolling.

1:07:40.039 --> 1:07:41.723
People thought that
what he had done

1:07:41.874 --> 1:07:43.283
was the right thing to do.

1:07:43.376 --> 1:07:45.802
Using violence to end slavery

1:07:45.896 --> 1:07:48.045
in a way that most
Republican politicians,

1:07:48.065 --> 1:07:49.305
including Lincoln,

1:07:49.457 --> 1:07:52.475
were not willing to even
consider at this point.

1:07:52.569 --> 1:07:55.236
And the reaction to
Brown is so important

1:07:55.463 --> 1:07:58.031
in setting up the
election of 1860.

1:07:59.150 --> 1:08:01.242
- In 1860, the Republican Party

1:08:01.469 --> 1:08:03.986
was only running a second
presidential candidate.

1:08:04.081 --> 1:08:06.581
Many Republicans assumed
that the famous New Yorker,

1:08:06.732 --> 1:08:10.401
William Henry Seward, would
be the Republican nominee.

1:08:10.495 --> 1:08:12.736
- Seward had carried the banner

1:08:12.756 --> 1:08:14.664
of the anti-slavery
movement for a decade,

1:08:14.758 --> 1:08:16.574
he was a great orator,

1:08:16.593 --> 1:08:19.502
and beloved in large
sections of the north.

1:08:19.596 --> 1:08:23.823
- But Dred Scott, Kansas
Nebraska Act, John Brown,

1:08:23.842 --> 1:08:26.267
all these things have been
ripping the country apart.

1:08:26.419 --> 1:08:27.585
Seward was not a candidate

1:08:27.604 --> 1:08:30.163
who people saw as could
bring that together.

1:08:30.181 --> 1:08:32.181
- So Republican
leaders in the east

1:08:32.275 --> 1:08:35.926
began looking around for
other possible alternatives.

1:08:35.946 --> 1:08:38.855
- [Harold] The Young
Men's Republican Union

1:08:38.949 --> 1:08:43.868
decides to organize a series
of lectures in New York.

1:08:45.271 --> 1:08:46.788
- Lincoln accepted the
invitation immediately.

1:08:47.015 --> 1:08:49.124
He was relatively
unknown in the east.

1:08:49.351 --> 1:08:50.941
If he can make an
impression there,

1:08:50.961 --> 1:08:53.536
then he can leave an
impression nationwide.

1:08:53.688 --> 1:08:55.855
The day of the speech he
had his photograph taken

1:08:55.874 --> 1:08:57.540
by Matthew Brady.

1:08:57.692 --> 1:08:58.708
That's an awareness

1:08:58.860 --> 1:09:01.094
that he's making himself
a national figure.

1:09:02.806 --> 1:09:04.197
- I'd like to
start by expressing

1:09:04.215 --> 1:09:06.866
my sincere gratitude to the

1:09:06.959 --> 1:09:08.810
Young Men's Central
Republican Union

1:09:09.037 --> 1:09:10.311
for all the work they've
done to publicize-

1:09:10.463 --> 1:09:12.221
- [Doris] By the time
he got to Cooper Union,

1:09:12.374 --> 1:09:15.057
even though he's gotten a new
suit, it's badly wrinkled,

1:09:15.152 --> 1:09:16.726
his hair was disheveled.

1:09:16.820 --> 1:09:17.944
He does look awkward.

1:09:19.898 --> 1:09:21.881
- That's Lincoln?

1:09:21.974 --> 1:09:23.658
Looks like he slept in a barn.

1:09:27.831 --> 1:09:30.147
- Mr. Lincoln, is there
anything you need?

1:09:30.241 --> 1:09:31.833
- No, Mr. McCormick.

1:09:33.895 --> 1:09:36.320
I reckon if I needed
anything, it's too late now.

1:09:36.339 --> 1:09:38.822
- [Announcer] Eminent
citizen of the west,

1:09:38.917 --> 1:09:43.069
ladies and gentlemen, Mr.
Abraham Lincoln of Illinois.

1:09:43.162 --> 1:09:47.015
(audience cheers and applauds)

1:10:00.697 --> 1:10:03.256
- Mister chairman and
citizens of New York.

1:10:03.274 --> 1:10:04.824
The facts I will deal with,

1:10:06.369 --> 1:10:10.038
the facts I will deal with
tonight are nothing new to you.

1:10:11.208 --> 1:10:13.691
If there shall be any novelty,

1:10:13.710 --> 1:10:15.710
it may be in the mode

1:10:15.937 --> 1:10:18.713
of presenting the
facts and observations.

1:10:18.864 --> 1:10:20.864
- Sounds like an
out of tune fiddle.

1:10:20.959 --> 1:10:22.550
- Give him a chance.

1:10:23.628 --> 1:10:24.794
- Lincoln comes out

1:10:24.888 --> 1:10:28.205
with his Indiana hick
accent filling the air.

1:10:28.299 --> 1:10:30.283
A man taking notes writes,

1:10:30.301 --> 1:10:33.544
this is New York,
this will never do.

1:10:33.638 --> 1:10:36.956
- And now if they would listen,
as I suppose they will not,

1:10:36.975 --> 1:10:40.068
I would address a few words
to the southern people.

1:10:40.219 --> 1:10:44.405
You have a specific and
well understood illusion

1:10:44.557 --> 1:10:46.574
to an assumed
constitutional right

1:10:48.136 --> 1:10:49.893
to take slaves into
federal territories

1:10:49.913 --> 1:10:51.537
and hold them there as property.

1:10:52.657 --> 1:10:53.748
But no such right

1:10:53.975 --> 1:10:55.917
is specifically written
in the Constitution.

1:10:57.312 --> 1:10:59.087
Your purpose then,
plainly stated,

1:10:59.314 --> 1:11:02.257
is that you will
destroy the government

1:11:02.408 --> 1:11:04.650
unless you be
allowed to construe

1:11:04.744 --> 1:11:06.594
and enforce the
Constitution as pleased.

1:11:08.156 --> 1:11:12.583
You will rule or
ruin in all events.

1:11:12.602 --> 1:11:15.061
- Something happens
around 10 minutes in.

1:11:16.606 --> 1:11:21.334
His voice relaxes, its
high pitch tininess melts

1:11:21.352 --> 1:11:24.112
into something more
endurable, more bearable.

1:11:24.263 --> 1:11:26.672
His eyes begin to flash.

1:11:26.691 --> 1:11:29.525
- Wrong as we think slavery is,

1:11:29.677 --> 1:11:32.936
we can yet afford to let
it alone where it is.

1:11:33.031 --> 1:11:35.957
But can we allow it to spread
into the national territories

1:11:36.184 --> 1:11:37.792
and overrun us here
in the free states?

1:11:39.854 --> 1:11:43.113
If our sense of
duty forbids this,

1:11:43.133 --> 1:11:48.469
then let us stand by our duty,
fearlessly and effectively.

1:11:50.198 --> 1:11:54.934
Let us have faith that
right makes might.

1:11:56.371 --> 1:11:59.981
And in that faith,
let us to the end,

1:12:00.208 --> 1:12:03.300
dare to do our duty
as we understand it.

1:12:03.320 --> 1:12:07.989
(audience cheers and applauds)

1:12:08.216 --> 1:12:10.716
- Here here!

1:12:10.810 --> 1:12:12.994
What do you think
of Lincoln now?

1:12:17.167 --> 1:12:18.724
- I appreciate that very much.

1:12:18.818 --> 1:12:21.002
I appreciate that very much.

1:12:24.232 --> 1:12:25.798
- [Harold] He
mesmerized this crowd.

1:12:27.418 --> 1:12:31.346
- After the Cooper Union speech,
he was all over the media.

1:12:31.573 --> 1:12:33.497
If it had been on
the internet today,

1:12:33.591 --> 1:12:35.591
it would have gone viral.

1:12:35.685 --> 1:12:38.519
- The next morning, every
newspaper in New York City

1:12:38.671 --> 1:12:40.838
carried an account
of this speech.

1:12:40.932 --> 1:12:44.525
And it's reprinted in Detroit,
in Washington, in Chicago,

1:12:44.677 --> 1:12:47.920
even a German language
version of this speech.

1:12:48.013 --> 1:12:49.939
- Invitations poured into him

1:12:50.033 --> 1:12:53.034
to go on further speeches
all throughout New England.

1:12:53.261 --> 1:12:55.870
- You have the 1860
election coming up.

1:12:56.021 --> 1:12:58.039
There are some
Republicans who see

1:12:58.190 --> 1:13:00.600
this guy in Lincoln
that is fresh,

1:13:00.618 --> 1:13:03.527
he's folksy, he's moderate.

1:13:03.546 --> 1:13:06.864
- He does seem to not be as
radical as William Seward,

1:13:06.883 --> 1:13:09.533
the absolute front runner
or Salmon Chase,

1:13:09.552 --> 1:13:11.277
the governor of Ohio.

1:13:11.295 --> 1:13:13.462
He's not as conservative
as Edward Bates,

1:13:13.615 --> 1:13:15.948
a judge, former
Congressman, from Missouri.

1:13:15.967 --> 1:13:19.468
Those are the three main
contenders for the nomination.

1:13:19.621 --> 1:13:22.045
So step-by-step, he's
accepting the fact that,

1:13:22.065 --> 1:13:25.566
I'm really running for the
president of the United States.

1:13:25.718 --> 1:13:27.885
And then he had this
extraordinary team

1:13:27.904 --> 1:13:30.738
headed by judge Davis going
to be his representative

1:13:30.965 --> 1:13:32.890
at the Republican
National Convention.

1:13:32.984 --> 1:13:34.224
And they loved him.

1:13:34.318 --> 1:13:36.226
They wanted to do everything
they could for him.

1:13:36.320 --> 1:13:40.489
- Now judge, you've got to
make sure that everyone knows

1:13:40.642 --> 1:13:41.732
which delegation
they're supposed

1:13:41.751 --> 1:13:43.142
to make friends with in Chicago.

1:13:43.235 --> 1:13:45.661
- I've drawn up a list
for our people to look after.

1:13:45.813 --> 1:13:49.315
- Tell them not to press
too hard or fuss too much.

1:13:49.408 --> 1:13:51.759
- We have to make some fuss.

1:13:51.911 --> 1:13:53.261
There'll be a lot of
New York men there

1:13:53.412 --> 1:13:55.337
pushing hard for Seward.

1:13:55.490 --> 1:13:58.157
If he takes it on the
first ballot we're licked.

1:13:58.250 --> 1:14:00.101
- He won't.
- He might.

1:14:02.605 --> 1:14:05.347
I understand that I'm
not anybody's first love,

1:14:05.500 --> 1:14:06.774
but I could be people's second.

1:14:11.673 --> 1:14:13.856
If I'm the second biggest
frog in that puddle,

1:14:13.950 --> 1:14:16.784
I got a fighting chance to
jump over the biggest one.

1:14:17.954 --> 1:14:19.436
- What we've got to do

1:14:19.456 --> 1:14:22.957
is get the delegates from
Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Ohio

1:14:24.461 --> 1:14:25.793
to go Lincoln.

1:14:25.945 --> 1:14:28.037
- Isn't Ohio just
gonna go to Chase?

1:14:28.189 --> 1:14:30.039
- Yeah, and Pennsylvania'll
be solid Cameron.

1:14:30.191 --> 1:14:31.632
- That's just the first ballot.

1:14:31.859 --> 1:14:33.968
They're gonna have to
switch to somebody.

1:14:35.454 --> 1:14:38.306
But we're gonna have to
promise them something,

1:14:39.642 --> 1:14:40.791
to make it worth their while.

1:14:40.810 --> 1:14:42.143
- No.

1:14:42.294 --> 1:14:43.644
No, judge.

1:14:45.648 --> 1:14:47.648
Don't make any pledges
that will tie me up.

1:14:50.878 --> 1:14:51.652
Okay?

1:14:53.214 --> 1:14:55.781
I can't be there so you've
got to do as I would do.

1:15:07.895 --> 1:15:09.228
- [Allen] The Republican
National Committee

1:15:09.321 --> 1:15:12.507
meets in May, 1860 in Chicago.

1:15:13.901 --> 1:15:15.176
- [Doris] It's a
very exciting thing,

1:15:15.403 --> 1:15:17.345
the Republican Party
is feeling its oats.

1:15:19.516 --> 1:15:22.074
- The presidential nominee
for the Republican Party,

1:15:22.093 --> 1:15:25.186
needs 233 votes to win.

1:15:26.689 --> 1:15:28.264
- [Allen] So while
Lincoln is in Springfield,

1:15:28.358 --> 1:15:31.433
he has his friends on
the ground in Chicago,

1:15:31.528 --> 1:15:36.197
headed by Judge Davis,
organizing as busily as beavers.

1:15:36.866 --> 1:15:38.015
(gavel thuds)

1:15:38.034 --> 1:15:38.991
- Order!

1:15:40.428 --> 1:15:45.114
Fellow Republicans, please
join your delegations.

1:15:45.266 --> 1:15:46.782
- [Doris] His team knows
that the importance is

1:15:46.934 --> 1:15:48.543
to win the battleground states,

1:15:48.694 --> 1:15:51.379
Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, Indiana.

1:15:51.530 --> 1:15:54.382
- We're about to begin
the first ballot.

1:15:56.961 --> 1:15:59.945
- I know you're gonna vote
Cameron in the first ballot.

1:16:00.039 --> 1:16:01.947
What about Lincoln
in the second?

1:16:01.966 --> 1:16:03.558
Can you swing
Pennsylvania our way?

1:16:04.786 --> 1:16:05.726
- That's a big ask.

1:16:06.804 --> 1:16:07.895
- What's it gonna take?

1:16:09.807 --> 1:16:10.565
- What've you got?

1:16:15.405 --> 1:16:17.238
- [Greg] As the first
round of voting goes,

1:16:17.465 --> 1:16:20.408
Seward, as expected,
gets the most votes.

1:16:20.635 --> 1:16:21.725
- [Doris] The
extraordinary thing is

1:16:21.744 --> 1:16:23.744
that Lincoln comes in second.

1:16:23.971 --> 1:16:25.971
- Seward might
have some problems.

1:16:25.990 --> 1:16:27.973
He's too radical.

1:16:27.992 --> 1:16:29.825
The backdrop of all of this

1:16:29.977 --> 1:16:32.311
is we've just dealt with
an execution of John Brown

1:16:32.404 --> 1:16:34.814
and the fever around John Brown.

1:16:34.832 --> 1:16:36.757
You've got this
relatively new party

1:16:36.984 --> 1:16:40.744
talking about holding
slavery where it is,

1:16:40.763 --> 1:16:43.264
but you also know that people
who have aligned themselves

1:16:43.491 --> 1:16:46.416
with Republicans are
saying, end it now.

1:16:46.436 --> 1:16:49.511
- And so the Republican Party
has to make a determination,

1:16:49.606 --> 1:16:50.438
principle

1:16:52.275 --> 1:16:53.349
electability.

1:16:53.443 --> 1:16:56.444
- We're about to begin
the second ballot.

1:16:57.447 --> 1:16:59.688
- So, what did Pennsylvania say?

1:16:59.841 --> 1:17:01.949
- They want treasury
for Cameron.

1:17:02.101 --> 1:17:03.784
- Abe said, make no
pledges, remember?

1:17:05.363 --> 1:17:05.953
- Abe's not here.

1:17:07.865 --> 1:17:09.123
- So what did you tell them?

1:17:15.706 --> 1:17:18.858
- [Doris] Lincoln is in
Springfield the entire time.

1:17:18.876 --> 1:17:21.093
- Mr. Lincoln, good
luck for today.

1:17:22.121 --> 1:17:24.363
- I appreciate that, Mr. Hay.

1:17:24.382 --> 1:17:26.140
- Don't you have
anything for us?

1:17:28.369 --> 1:17:31.812
- All I have is this
message from Judge Davis,

1:17:33.207 --> 1:17:35.650
I'm very hopeful,
don't be excited.

1:17:37.061 --> 1:17:38.319
Any idea what that means?

1:17:39.897 --> 1:17:42.990
- After the second ballot,
Seward gains a few more votes,

1:17:44.235 --> 1:17:45.718
Lincoln gains many more

1:17:45.736 --> 1:17:48.645
as delegations now
switch to Lincoln.

1:17:48.665 --> 1:17:50.055
They call for a third ballot.

1:17:50.074 --> 1:17:52.725
- That idea that I would
like to be your second love

1:17:52.818 --> 1:17:54.484
if I can't get your first love

1:17:54.578 --> 1:17:56.837
means that people who might've
gone for Chase or Bates

1:17:56.989 --> 1:17:58.339
now are going for Lincoln.

1:17:58.490 --> 1:18:00.174
- That concludes
the third ballot.

1:18:01.511 --> 1:18:04.804
And as yet, no candidate
has the majority.

1:18:05.923 --> 1:18:07.907
So we will now reconvene.

1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:10.259
- So on the final
round of voting,

1:18:10.411 --> 1:18:14.355
Lincoln has 231
and a half votes.

1:18:14.506 --> 1:18:17.358
All he needs is another
one and a half votes.

1:18:18.695 --> 1:18:21.362
(gavel thuds)

1:18:21.589 --> 1:18:22.196
- Order.

1:18:23.533 --> 1:18:24.365
Order!

1:18:27.428 --> 1:18:32.039
The state of Ohio wishes
to change its vote.

1:18:33.525 --> 1:18:36.043
Ohio, what is your final vote?

1:18:37.714 --> 1:18:40.881
Ohio, give me a vote now,
what is your final vote?

1:18:42.385 --> 1:18:45.052
(dramatic music)

1:18:53.396 --> 1:18:55.563
The state of Ohio wishes
to change its vote.

1:18:56.899 --> 1:19:01.402
It wishes to switch four
votes from Mr. Chase

1:19:04.148 --> 1:19:08.909
to Mr. Lincoln.

1:19:10.580 --> 1:19:15.249
(audience cheers and applauds)
- We've won.

1:19:18.829 --> 1:19:22.590
- Send a telegram to
Springfield, straight away!

1:19:26.153 --> 1:19:27.319
Yes!

1:19:27.412 --> 1:19:29.079
(audience cheers and applauds)

1:19:29.098 --> 1:19:31.599
Yes, yes, yes, Lincoln, Lincoln!

1:19:34.586 --> 1:19:36.437
- The gentlemen walks
into the theater,

1:19:36.664 --> 1:19:39.089
and sets his stovetop
hat down beside him.

1:19:39.108 --> 1:19:41.091
Well, he gets so
wrapped up in the drama

1:19:41.110 --> 1:19:43.778
that he didn't realize
that old stout woman

1:19:44.005 --> 1:19:45.504
come and sit down
right next to him.

1:19:45.523 --> 1:19:46.280
Yes?

1:19:50.361 --> 1:19:51.118
It's from Chicago.

1:19:59.186 --> 1:20:02.187
(advisors clapping)

1:20:02.206 --> 1:20:04.948
- Congratulations, sir.

1:20:04.967 --> 1:20:08.210
- Mr. Hay, thank you.

1:20:08.362 --> 1:20:10.029
Thank you, gentlemen.
- Congratulations.

1:20:10.047 --> 1:20:11.621
- Thank you, gentlemen.

1:20:11.641 --> 1:20:14.366
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1:20:14.385 --> 1:20:14.975
Wow.

1:20:16.220 --> 1:20:20.648
Well, thank you. gentlemen.

1:20:22.467 --> 1:20:23.150
If you'll excuse me,

1:20:24.879 --> 1:20:26.045
there's a little
woman on Eighth Street

1:20:26.138 --> 1:20:27.729
who will be glad
to hear the news.

1:20:27.824 --> 1:20:28.972
- Yes she will.

1:20:29.066 --> 1:20:31.992
(advisors clapping)

1:20:36.315 --> 1:20:38.332
- Lincoln's nomination
shocked people.

1:20:39.393 --> 1:20:41.393
They had expected Seward to win,

1:20:41.412 --> 1:20:43.245
but this new guy had won.

1:20:43.339 --> 1:20:46.398
And there's an excitement
and they rally around him.

1:20:46.417 --> 1:20:49.418
- When Lincoln gets the
nomination in May of 1860

1:20:49.570 --> 1:20:53.238
in the north, he's
the surprise nominee.

1:20:53.257 --> 1:20:56.575
He doesn't have that much
experience running anything.

1:20:56.594 --> 1:20:58.594
He's not that well known.

1:20:58.688 --> 1:21:01.246
- Frederick Douglass and
other African-Americans

1:21:01.340 --> 1:21:03.749
were not too sure of Lincoln.

1:21:03.842 --> 1:21:05.601
Just because he was a Republican

1:21:05.695 --> 1:21:08.028
doesn't mean that this
man is an abolitionists

1:21:08.255 --> 1:21:10.680
or that he's going
to do us any good.

1:21:10.700 --> 1:21:13.850
- At the same time,
he's hated in the south,

1:21:13.870 --> 1:21:17.705
and it was pretty
clearly a racist hatred.

1:21:17.856 --> 1:21:20.616
There were accusations
that he had African blood

1:21:20.710 --> 1:21:22.692
or his wife did.

1:21:22.712 --> 1:21:25.621
Southern newspapers
call him terrible names,

1:21:25.773 --> 1:21:28.273
he's a baboon, he's a gorilla.

1:21:28.292 --> 1:21:30.718
He's illiterate, he's a tyrant.

1:21:32.054 --> 1:21:34.204
- But going into the
general election,

1:21:34.223 --> 1:21:37.282
there's a great possibility
that the Republicans will win,

1:21:37.301 --> 1:21:39.393
because the Democratic
Party has split apart.

1:21:41.063 --> 1:21:44.306
- There are four candidates
in the election of 1860.

1:21:44.458 --> 1:21:46.808
Of course, Lincoln for
the Republican Party.

1:21:46.903 --> 1:21:49.052
Meanwhile, the Democratic
Party has split itself

1:21:49.146 --> 1:21:50.312
into two factions.

1:21:50.464 --> 1:21:51.572
You have John Breckenridge,

1:21:51.723 --> 1:21:54.557
who's representing the
white slaveholding south.

1:21:54.577 --> 1:21:58.303
You have Stephen Douglas
representing white northerners.

1:21:58.322 --> 1:22:01.490
And then you have the Union
Party led by John Bell.

1:22:01.584 --> 1:22:04.251
- This is one of the
most exciting elections

1:22:04.403 --> 1:22:06.979
in American history
to that point.

1:22:06.997 --> 1:22:08.997
- The future of the nation,

1:22:09.091 --> 1:22:12.742
the future of the democracy
really seemed at stake.

1:22:12.762 --> 1:22:16.338
In Europe during this time,
some experiments in democracy

1:22:16.490 --> 1:22:19.266
in France and Germany had failed

1:22:19.418 --> 1:22:23.011
and had gone back to being
monarchies and dictatorships.

1:22:23.105 --> 1:22:25.606
This great American
experiment in democracy

1:22:25.757 --> 1:22:27.775
was so new and so fragile.

1:22:29.594 --> 1:22:32.020
- Meanwhile, Lincoln's
at home in Springfield.

1:22:32.114 --> 1:22:34.856
It was not considered
proper for a candidate

1:22:35.009 --> 1:22:37.785
to really campaign for
himself in those days.

1:22:37.936 --> 1:22:39.269
- But during the election,

1:22:39.288 --> 1:22:42.030
Matthew Brady's
photograph of Lincoln

1:22:42.124 --> 1:22:45.793
was so widely reproduced,
that picture was everywhere.

1:22:45.944 --> 1:22:47.277
It was in illustrated
newspapers,

1:22:47.371 --> 1:22:49.630
engravings for display,

1:22:49.781 --> 1:22:51.799
pins you could
wear on your lapel.

1:22:53.452 --> 1:22:55.636
- A few weeks
before the election,

1:22:55.787 --> 1:22:58.138
Lincoln's receiving letters
from people and reading them.

1:22:58.290 --> 1:23:01.383
And he receives a letter
from an 11 year old girl.

1:23:01.535 --> 1:23:04.052
She asked him to grow a beard.

1:23:04.146 --> 1:23:06.463
She said that she thought
he would look better

1:23:06.557 --> 1:23:09.891
and Lincoln does grow a beard
and it looks good on him.

1:23:10.044 --> 1:23:11.652
He's listening to
his constituency.

1:23:13.305 --> 1:23:14.546
- The day of the
general election,

1:23:14.639 --> 1:23:16.473
he's restless all day long.

1:23:16.492 --> 1:23:18.900
He's been so familiar
with disappointment

1:23:18.995 --> 1:23:22.221
that he just fears
something bad will happen.

1:23:22.239 --> 1:23:24.665
About nine o'clock he and
Judge Davis and the friends

1:23:24.816 --> 1:23:27.984
go to the Telegraph office to
hear the returns coming in.

1:23:28.078 --> 1:23:29.561
Finally at midnight,

1:23:29.580 --> 1:23:30.487
the word comes in

1:23:30.506 --> 1:23:32.506
that New York has
gone Republican.

1:23:32.657 --> 1:23:35.676
Then the church bells ring,
people gather in the streets.

1:23:35.827 --> 1:23:36.844
This new guy had won.

1:23:40.999 --> 1:23:42.424
And then he runs
home, as he says,

1:23:42.576 --> 1:23:47.021
to tell Mary and famously says,
Mary Mary, we are elected.

1:23:47.248 --> 1:23:49.672
Mary always believed
that he had a destiny.

1:23:49.767 --> 1:23:50.691
She surely believed in him

1:23:50.842 --> 1:23:52.417
at the lowest
moments of his life.

1:23:52.436 --> 1:23:54.361
And now his great
moment has arrived.

1:23:57.033 --> 1:23:59.867
- But Lincoln, our
most beloved president,

1:24:00.094 --> 1:24:03.612
won with the second
worst popular vote.

1:24:03.764 --> 1:24:08.450
He only got 39.8% of the
vote, which is very small.

1:24:08.602 --> 1:24:11.045
We now get worried if
someone has less than 50%,

1:24:11.196 --> 1:24:13.605
he had less than 40%.

1:24:13.624 --> 1:24:15.274
In the electoral college he

1:24:15.292 --> 1:24:17.534
got more than half, got 180,

1:24:17.628 --> 1:24:19.202
but still it was not

1:24:19.221 --> 1:24:20.721
a resounding victory.

1:24:20.872 --> 1:24:24.040
- Southern states have been
saying, if this man is elected,

1:24:24.060 --> 1:24:26.376
we will have no
choice but to secede.

1:24:26.395 --> 1:24:28.303
And as soon as he is elected,

1:24:28.397 --> 1:24:32.307
South Carolina decided to
have a secession convention

1:24:32.459 --> 1:24:36.236
and by December of 1860, they
decide to leave the Union.

1:24:37.798 --> 1:24:42.301
- In February of 1861,
seven US states seceded.

1:24:42.394 --> 1:24:44.319
The Confederate
government formed

1:24:44.471 --> 1:24:47.806
and puts Jefferson Davis
in place as president.

1:24:47.825 --> 1:24:50.400
- They're seceding, for one
thing and one thing only,

1:24:50.419 --> 1:24:53.645
and that is the preservation
of slavery and its expansion.

1:24:53.664 --> 1:24:56.815
Anybody who says its'
states' rights, it's tariffs,

1:24:56.834 --> 1:24:58.500
this is nonsense.

1:24:58.594 --> 1:25:00.485
You have not read the
articles of secession

1:25:00.579 --> 1:25:02.579
that every single
state laid out.

1:25:02.598 --> 1:25:05.432
And in every single one of
them they've made very clear

1:25:05.584 --> 1:25:07.267
why they are seceding.

1:25:07.419 --> 1:25:09.937
And it is to preserve the
institution of slavery

1:25:10.164 --> 1:25:13.440
to control that financial
interest forever.

1:25:14.777 --> 1:25:17.519
- Lincoln believed
over optimistically,

1:25:17.671 --> 1:25:18.687
that there was a way

1:25:18.781 --> 1:25:20.839
to get these southern
slave holding states

1:25:20.858 --> 1:25:23.951
back in the Union once he
actually got to Washington.

1:25:25.179 --> 1:25:27.028
But before he left Illinois,

1:25:27.123 --> 1:25:30.106
Lincoln decided to visit his
stepmother one more time.

1:25:30.126 --> 1:25:33.109
He had refused to visit his
father on his death bed,

1:25:33.129 --> 1:25:35.462
so his father died without
Lincoln seeing him again.

1:25:36.615 --> 1:25:38.132
- If it were up to me,

1:25:38.359 --> 1:25:39.967
you'd have no part
in being a president.

1:25:41.712 --> 1:25:45.806
The way folks talk, I can't
help but worry about you.

1:25:46.033 --> 1:25:47.975
- Oh, stop your
worrying, I'll be fine.

1:25:55.467 --> 1:25:56.650
Gotta get him a proper stone.

1:25:59.229 --> 1:26:00.654
- He'd be proud of you.

1:26:05.886 --> 1:26:08.162
- You always see the
best in folks, momma.

1:26:14.503 --> 1:26:17.671
We'll see each other
again, I promise.

1:26:28.091 --> 1:26:31.243
- On February 11th, 1861,

1:26:31.261 --> 1:26:35.580
Lincoln begins the train
journey to Washington D.C.

1:26:35.599 --> 1:26:37.766
It would have been nice to
take the shortest route,

1:26:37.918 --> 1:26:41.028
but he couldn't go through
Kentucky, the state he was born,

1:26:41.255 --> 1:26:43.588
or Virginia, because
it was too dangerous.

1:26:43.682 --> 1:26:44.698
He wrote a letter to a friend

1:26:44.849 --> 1:26:46.867
that he was worried
he might be lynched.

1:26:47.018 --> 1:26:49.536
So he has to go in this very
winding roundabout route

1:26:49.688 --> 1:26:51.780
over 1900 miles.

1:26:51.932 --> 1:26:53.782
Whenever Lincoln
comes in anywhere,

1:26:53.934 --> 1:26:56.101
everybody comes out to see him.

1:26:56.119 --> 1:26:59.788
- There's hope, but
there's also this fear.

1:26:59.940 --> 1:27:00.863
People would have known

1:27:00.958 --> 1:27:03.108
that the southern
states have seceded.

1:27:03.126 --> 1:27:04.626
These are difficult times

1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:06.461
and there are credible
assassination threats

1:27:06.555 --> 1:27:08.280
against Lincoln.

1:27:08.298 --> 1:27:09.872
- [Harold] There was
intelligence of a

1:27:09.892 --> 1:27:11.299
massive conspiracy

1:27:11.452 --> 1:27:13.560
to try to assassinate him as
he came through Baltimore.

1:27:15.231 --> 1:27:19.066
The leader of the plot had
a system of drawing lots,

1:27:19.217 --> 1:27:22.461
pieces of paper with
a red dot on them.

1:27:22.479 --> 1:27:25.405
And those who got a red dot
would try to kill Lincoln

1:27:25.632 --> 1:27:29.801
with guns and
knives and grenades.

1:27:29.820 --> 1:27:33.247
But Allen Pinkerton, who
was a railroad detective,

1:27:33.398 --> 1:27:36.416
penetrated the conspiracy
with operatives.

1:27:43.667 --> 1:27:45.425
- Davis?
- Mr. Pinkerton.

1:27:47.096 --> 1:27:47.928
It's all true.

1:27:50.599 --> 1:27:53.100
Anyone who picked one with
a red dot is an assassin.

1:27:54.344 --> 1:27:56.419
- How many have red dots?

1:27:56.438 --> 1:27:57.104
- Eight.

1:27:58.348 --> 1:28:00.440
- It's worse than I thought.

1:28:04.780 --> 1:28:07.447
(dramatic music)

1:28:14.681 --> 1:28:16.623
(train bell ringing)

1:28:20.521 --> 1:28:22.111
- The door's locked
from the inside?

1:28:22.131 --> 1:28:22.963
- Yes, ma'am.

1:28:24.967 --> 1:28:25.632
- Key, please.

1:28:28.211 --> 1:28:31.287
My uncle is an invalid, he
requires absolute privacy.

1:28:31.307 --> 1:28:33.289
Do you understand?

1:28:33.383 --> 1:28:36.310
(suspenseful music)

1:28:51.735 --> 1:28:53.718
- We'll take a special
overnight train.

1:28:53.737 --> 1:28:55.220
I've cleared the tracks

1:28:55.238 --> 1:28:57.814
and had the telegraph lanes
cut from here to Baltimore.

1:28:57.908 --> 1:29:00.983
These men intend to create
a diversion with the police

1:29:01.003 --> 1:29:03.152
and stab you to death.

1:29:03.172 --> 1:29:04.654
- That's all?

1:29:04.748 --> 1:29:06.489
Like Julius Caesar.

1:29:06.508 --> 1:29:08.675
- You need to take
this seriously, Abe.

1:29:08.827 --> 1:29:10.010
You have fierce enemies.

1:29:11.405 --> 1:29:14.239
- If I sneak into the
Capitol with fear,

1:29:14.257 --> 1:29:16.833
I'm showing good people
there's reason to fear.

1:29:16.852 --> 1:29:20.020
- Sir, the worst thing
that could happen

1:29:20.247 --> 1:29:22.022
is you don't make it
to Washington at all.

1:29:23.417 --> 1:29:25.192
You can't risk being recognized.

1:29:32.350 --> 1:29:33.033
- Take care of it.

1:29:35.779 --> 1:29:38.705
(suspenseful music)

1:29:59.636 --> 1:30:02.729
(train whistle blowing)

1:30:17.562 --> 1:30:19.971
- This is my associate,
Mrs. Kate Warne.

1:30:20.064 --> 1:30:22.899
- Mr. Lincoln, it's an honor.

1:30:22.993 --> 1:30:27.162
- Mrs. Warne, I am far to
plain to pass for your uncle.

1:30:27.314 --> 1:30:28.813
- [Kate] Not at all, sir.

1:30:28.832 --> 1:30:29.831
- I take comfort in the idea

1:30:29.983 --> 1:30:32.092
that common folk are
the best lookin'.

1:30:32.319 --> 1:30:34.911
That's why the lord
made us so many.

1:30:35.005 --> 1:30:38.098
(train whistle blowing)

1:30:42.012 --> 1:30:44.604
(Lincoln sighs)

1:30:48.835 --> 1:30:49.734
Well

1:30:51.095 --> 1:30:54.096
this is not how I planned
to get to Washington.

1:30:54.191 --> 1:30:56.691
(suspenseful music)

1:30:56.843 --> 1:30:59.101
(train whistle blowing)

1:30:59.121 --> 1:31:01.938
- Lincoln goes from
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

1:31:01.957 --> 1:31:06.626
to Philadelphia, to
Baltimore, to Washington

1:31:06.778 --> 1:31:10.630
at night in secret
wearing a disguise.

1:31:10.782 --> 1:31:14.468
He arrives in Washington,
six A.M., unannounced,

1:31:14.695 --> 1:31:16.878
and he was attacked
in the press,

1:31:16.972 --> 1:31:20.623
depicted in these crazy
disguises, including kilts,

1:31:20.642 --> 1:31:23.143
doing the McLincoln
Highland Fling,

1:31:23.294 --> 1:31:24.886
and just ridiculed.

1:31:25.038 --> 1:31:26.888
Not a good thing for a president

1:31:27.040 --> 1:31:29.649
who was coming to Washington
to exhibit courage.

1:31:29.801 --> 1:31:30.892
Frederick Douglass says,

1:31:31.044 --> 1:31:34.136
at least now Mr. Lincoln
knows what it's like

1:31:34.156 --> 1:31:35.822
to travel on the
Underground Railroad.

1:31:37.308 --> 1:31:39.326
- When Lincoln ascends
to the presidency

1:31:39.553 --> 1:31:42.662
and he issues his first
inaugural address,

1:31:42.814 --> 1:31:45.240
African-Americans are
waiting in anticipation

1:31:45.392 --> 1:31:46.908
to see what he's going to say.

1:31:47.060 --> 1:31:48.668
Because by this time

1:31:48.820 --> 1:31:52.154
seven states have
seceded from the Union

1:31:52.174 --> 1:31:54.657
and African-Americans
are thinking,

1:31:54.676 --> 1:31:55.842
this is our opportunity.

1:31:56.069 --> 1:31:59.179
You know, this is the
time to end slavery.

1:31:59.406 --> 1:32:01.831
You got this
Republican who has won,

1:32:01.925 --> 1:32:03.350
he's not an abolitionist,

1:32:03.577 --> 1:32:05.018
but you've got enough
Republicans

1:32:05.169 --> 1:32:07.336
who are ready to move

1:32:07.430 --> 1:32:10.915
on these people who are seen
as traitors to the country.

1:32:11.009 --> 1:32:13.360
- His first inaugural address

1:32:13.511 --> 1:32:16.421
is a moment fraught
with tension.

1:32:16.514 --> 1:32:17.364
- [Harold] There were still

1:32:17.591 --> 1:32:21.017
very serious fears
of assassination.

1:32:21.036 --> 1:32:24.371
- Fellow citizens of
the United States,

1:32:25.932 --> 1:32:30.377
in your hands my dissatisfied
fellow countrymen,

1:32:32.047 --> 1:32:37.125
and not in mine, is the
momentous issue of Civil War.

1:32:38.111 --> 1:32:40.720
- Lincoln wanted the
speech to be strong

1:32:40.872 --> 1:32:42.280
without being threatening,

1:32:42.299 --> 1:32:45.058
to try to stem the
tide of secession.

1:32:45.209 --> 1:32:47.894
- The government
will not assail you.

1:32:49.565 --> 1:32:51.790
You can have no conflict

1:32:51.808 --> 1:32:55.235
without yourselves
being the aggressors.

1:32:55.386 --> 1:32:59.297
- He says federal forts and
armories would be protected.

1:32:59.316 --> 1:33:01.983
And at the same time, he
says, I'm not a threat.

1:33:02.135 --> 1:33:06.746
And he promised to enforce
the hated fugitive slave law.

1:33:07.916 --> 1:33:11.251
- We are not
enemies, but friends.

1:33:12.829 --> 1:33:14.588
We must not be enemies.

1:33:16.741 --> 1:33:19.426
Though passion
may have strained,

1:33:20.987 --> 1:33:24.097
it must not break our
bonds of affection.

1:33:25.434 --> 1:33:27.325
- Lincoln had shown this
speech to William Seward

1:33:27.418 --> 1:33:29.494
and Seward made corrections.

1:33:29.512 --> 1:33:31.830
And then Seward looked at
the ending of the draft

1:33:31.848 --> 1:33:34.666
and it says, it's your choice,
my friends in the south,

1:33:34.759 --> 1:33:38.094
will it be peace or a sword?

1:33:38.113 --> 1:33:40.338
And Seward says, you
can end it like this.

1:33:40.357 --> 1:33:43.358
So Seward writes out
a really good idea.

1:33:43.510 --> 1:33:45.193
Lincoln looks at the suggestion

1:33:45.287 --> 1:33:49.030
and displaying as much
brilliance as an editor

1:33:49.182 --> 1:33:51.366
as he showed as a writer,

1:33:51.518 --> 1:33:54.794
he recast Seward's
proposal into poetry.

1:33:56.131 --> 1:33:59.040
- The mystic chords of memory,

1:33:59.134 --> 1:34:03.211
stretching from every
battlefield and patriot grave

1:34:03.305 --> 1:34:06.806
to every heart and hearthstone
all over this broad land

1:34:08.292 --> 1:34:10.477
will yet swell the
chorus of the Union

1:34:11.813 --> 1:34:15.315
when again touched, as
surely they will be,

1:34:16.877 --> 1:34:20.153
by the better angels
of our nature.

1:34:22.974 --> 1:34:26.826
(audience cheers and applauds)

1:34:36.838 --> 1:34:40.248
- This beautifully
crafted final paragraph

1:34:40.342 --> 1:34:45.253
steps away from threats
and just says, remember,

1:34:45.405 --> 1:34:47.405
we are all part of
the same country

1:34:47.424 --> 1:34:52.001
with equally valid
memories of the revolution

1:34:52.020 --> 1:34:53.687
that not only gave
us our independence,

1:34:53.838 --> 1:34:56.022
but created a new
kind of country.

1:34:58.176 --> 1:35:00.360
- But Lincoln was
totally disappointing

1:35:00.511 --> 1:35:03.196
to Frederick Douglass and
other black men and women.

1:35:03.423 --> 1:35:06.199
Because in that first
inaugural address,

1:35:06.350 --> 1:35:11.037
Lincoln talked about the fact
that he had no inclination,

1:35:11.189 --> 1:35:14.766
no right, to actually do
anything about slavery,

1:35:14.784 --> 1:35:16.209
where it already existed.

1:35:17.695 --> 1:35:19.528
- But he's also
telling the south,

1:35:19.548 --> 1:35:23.441
he will not permit
an illegal rebellion

1:35:23.534 --> 1:35:26.702
to happen without a response.

1:35:26.796 --> 1:35:31.558
- Lincoln has an immediate
military problem on his plate.

1:35:32.452 --> 1:35:34.043
- When those states
in the south secede,

1:35:34.062 --> 1:35:36.879
they take over many of the
federal arsenals and forts.

1:35:36.898 --> 1:35:38.306
That leaves the United States

1:35:38.400 --> 1:35:40.549
with just a few federal
ports that it keeps,

1:35:40.569 --> 1:35:43.719
including Fort Sumter in
Charleston, South Carolina.

1:35:43.739 --> 1:35:45.721
- The first day after
his inauguration,

1:35:45.815 --> 1:35:48.816
he receives a message from
Major Anderson at Fort Sumter,

1:35:48.969 --> 1:35:51.319
telling him that they are
running out of supplies

1:35:51.413 --> 1:35:53.805
and unless an expedition
can bring them relief,

1:35:53.898 --> 1:35:54.748
they will have to evacuate.

1:35:56.734 --> 1:35:58.476
- Lincoln and the federal
government maintained

1:35:58.495 --> 1:36:02.830
that all federal property
still belongs to the Union.

1:36:02.983 --> 1:36:05.091
- So he meets with his cabinet.

1:36:05.243 --> 1:36:06.575
The night Lincoln
won the election

1:36:06.669 --> 1:36:09.429
he had made a decision that
will define his presidency

1:36:09.580 --> 1:36:11.489
to put each of his
chief three rivals,

1:36:11.508 --> 1:36:12.932
Seward and Chase and Bates,

1:36:13.084 --> 1:36:15.084
into the top positions
of the cabinet.

1:36:15.103 --> 1:36:17.419
William Seward as
Secretary of State.

1:36:17.439 --> 1:36:19.514
Salmon Chase, Secretary
of the Treasury,

1:36:19.666 --> 1:36:22.000
Edward Bates, Attorney General.

1:36:22.018 --> 1:36:23.443
Each one of those
three rivals thought

1:36:23.594 --> 1:36:26.187
he should have been president
instead of Abraham Lincoln.

1:36:26.281 --> 1:36:28.782
And they think that Lincoln's
rather unremarkable,

1:36:29.009 --> 1:36:31.692
but Lincoln realized
the country is in peril.

1:36:31.787 --> 1:36:33.694
These are the most able
men in the country.

1:36:33.789 --> 1:36:35.955
They each represented a
different point of view,

1:36:36.182 --> 1:36:38.274
the moderate,
conservative, and radical.

1:36:38.368 --> 1:36:39.793
I need them by my side.

1:36:41.371 --> 1:36:43.279
President Lyndon Johnson
might've talked about that issue

1:36:43.373 --> 1:36:44.689
in less noble terms.

1:36:44.782 --> 1:36:46.858
He liked to say, it's
better to have your enemies

1:36:46.951 --> 1:36:48.526
inside the tent pissing out

1:36:48.545 --> 1:36:50.970
than outside the
tent pissing in.

1:36:51.197 --> 1:36:52.864
- General Scott
says we have no hope

1:36:52.957 --> 1:36:55.791
but to surrender Fort Sumter.

1:36:55.811 --> 1:36:56.309
- Yes.

1:36:58.721 --> 1:37:00.555
And I think he's right.

1:37:00.707 --> 1:37:02.798
- But Mr. Seward,
only yesterday,

1:37:02.892 --> 1:37:07.654
I gave my solemn vow to hold,
occupy, and possess our forts.

1:37:08.323 --> 1:37:10.381
I believe you helped
me craft that passage.

1:37:10.474 --> 1:37:12.325
- The situation
has changed, sir.

1:37:14.070 --> 1:37:17.313
Fort Sumter can't hold
out, not without supplies.

1:37:17.407 --> 1:37:18.556
And the South Carolinians

1:37:18.575 --> 1:37:21.000
have made their intentions
more than clear.

1:37:22.228 --> 1:37:22.836
I advise withdrawal.

1:37:24.898 --> 1:37:26.155
It'll make it seem
like our idea,

1:37:26.174 --> 1:37:28.508
not that this a secessionists
have forced us out.

1:37:28.659 --> 1:37:30.510
- It seems the most
reasonable course.

1:37:32.514 --> 1:37:33.346
- No.

1:37:34.574 --> 1:37:36.850
I'd be encouraging
their rebellion.

1:37:37.001 --> 1:37:38.409
The country would crumble.

1:37:38.428 --> 1:37:39.927
- It's already crumbling.

1:37:40.080 --> 1:37:42.504
We need time to
shore it back up.

1:37:42.524 --> 1:37:43.672
Wait for cooler hands.

1:37:43.766 --> 1:37:45.525
- We must send more ships.

1:37:47.028 --> 1:37:50.755
A fleet carrying
reinforcements and long guns.

1:37:50.773 --> 1:37:53.774
I'll bet a bombardment will
force them to back off.

1:37:53.927 --> 1:37:57.036
- Since when were you
a Navy man, Blair?

1:37:57.188 --> 1:37:58.596
I say, we withdraw.

1:37:58.615 --> 1:38:02.691
- Mr. President, look where
compromise has gotten us.

1:38:02.711 --> 1:38:06.195
We have to crush them now
before they grow stronger.

1:38:06.214 --> 1:38:09.048
- I will not be the first
to fire on my country men.

1:38:10.443 --> 1:38:11.718
I told them that my speech too.

1:38:13.388 --> 1:38:15.054
- That leaves no alternative.

1:38:20.954 --> 1:38:22.395
- How long can
Sumter, hold out for?

1:38:24.290 --> 1:38:26.232
- General Scott thinks 26 days.

1:38:30.554 --> 1:38:33.239
- How many of you
say give up the fort?

1:38:39.305 --> 1:38:41.973
- You have to give up the fort,

1:38:41.991 --> 1:38:43.583
or we'll bring this
country to war.

1:38:49.090 --> 1:38:51.758
(dramatic music)

1:38:58.341 --> 1:39:01.750
- [Doris] Those weeks of
anticipation before Fort Sumter,

1:39:01.770 --> 1:39:03.269
where the hardest weeks for him.

1:39:04.940 --> 1:39:07.331
He's still hoping that
maybe there'd be some way

1:39:07.350 --> 1:39:08.441
to prevent a war.

1:39:25.794 --> 1:39:26.459
- Look.

1:39:28.779 --> 1:39:29.704
All the papers want to know

1:39:29.798 --> 1:39:31.464
what you're gonna
do about that fort.

1:39:32.634 --> 1:39:34.300
- Well, so do I.

1:39:42.978 --> 1:39:43.977
- Huh.

1:39:48.984 --> 1:39:52.151
You have done a fine job
with this scrapbook, Willie.

1:39:55.657 --> 1:39:58.382
- He's thinking, if I
provision Fort Sumter,

1:39:58.476 --> 1:39:59.826
it might bring about a war.

1:40:00.887 --> 1:40:02.311
If I don't do that,

1:40:02.330 --> 1:40:03.721
then maybe we're gonna look like

1:40:03.814 --> 1:40:05.072
we're so emboldening the south

1:40:05.166 --> 1:40:08.317
that it will make the
secession even more permanent.

1:40:08.411 --> 1:40:11.004
There's division in the cabinet
as to what he should do.

1:40:12.340 --> 1:40:15.233
- Seward is talking
to South Carolina.

1:40:15.251 --> 1:40:18.586
He's having discussions with
the secessionist leaders.

1:40:18.738 --> 1:40:20.996
Basically suggesting that
this can be negotiated,

1:40:21.090 --> 1:40:22.998
things can be worked out.

1:40:23.018 --> 1:40:26.352
And he's doing so without
Lincoln's knowledge or approval.

1:40:28.839 --> 1:40:30.097
- If we send troops down south

1:40:30.191 --> 1:40:34.527
we'll lose Virginia, Arkansas,
all the border states.

1:40:36.105 --> 1:40:37.196
Time is running out.

1:40:38.591 --> 1:40:41.108
Abandoning the
fort is inevitable.

1:40:41.261 --> 1:40:44.853
We can't let the rebels
humiliate us by overrunning it.

1:40:44.873 --> 1:40:47.206
The sooner we leave on
our own, the better.

1:40:49.952 --> 1:40:52.045
Now we have a clear cut
majority in agreement,

1:40:53.715 --> 1:40:54.547
so it's decided.

1:41:04.117 --> 1:41:08.302
- No, it's not decided,
Secretary Seward.

1:41:08.454 --> 1:41:10.563
It's not decided
until I decide it.

1:41:18.907 --> 1:41:20.889
(Clears throat)

1:41:20.909 --> 1:41:24.819
- Mr. President.

1:41:24.971 --> 1:41:28.897
- Now, I reckon that everything

1:41:28.917 --> 1:41:30.416
Secretary Seward says is true.

1:41:31.978 --> 1:41:33.920
But there are also other
things that are true.

1:41:35.815 --> 1:41:38.424
One of them bein' that I'm not
willing to go back on my word

1:41:39.761 --> 1:41:41.761
and I'm also not
ready to give up.

1:41:43.172 --> 1:41:43.930
The way I see it,

1:41:45.266 --> 1:41:47.600
is that surrender would
be ruinous to the Union

1:41:48.995 --> 1:41:50.661
by discouraging
the folks at home

1:41:50.754 --> 1:41:52.921
and encouraging our adversaries.

1:41:52.941 --> 1:41:54.665
And it might get this
illegal confederacy

1:41:54.758 --> 1:41:56.109
recognized by foreign powers.

1:41:57.595 --> 1:41:59.779
I have talked to a Navy man

1:42:00.006 --> 1:42:02.598
who's got a plan to
send supplies by sea

1:42:02.692 --> 1:42:03.783
backed by a warship.

1:42:06.696 --> 1:42:07.954
And I have decided to do it.

1:42:15.538 --> 1:42:18.356
- Lincoln's response
was brief and firm.

1:42:18.374 --> 1:42:20.800
That puts Seward pretty
firmly in his place

1:42:21.027 --> 1:42:23.711
and it is something
of a tribute to Seward

1:42:23.863 --> 1:42:26.955
that he understood that
Lincoln was the boss

1:42:26.975 --> 1:42:28.883
and that there was
more to Abraham Lincoln

1:42:29.035 --> 1:42:30.643
than he had originally thought.

1:42:32.038 --> 1:42:33.220
- Lincoln doesn't
want to create war.

1:42:33.373 --> 1:42:36.056
So he tries to, again,
thread the needle on this.

1:42:36.151 --> 1:42:38.709
And he says to the
governor of South Carolina,

1:42:38.728 --> 1:42:41.136
look, I will just
send food and water.

1:42:41.230 --> 1:42:43.156
I won't send one more man,
not one more grain of powder,

1:42:43.383 --> 1:42:44.732
not one more bullet
to Fort Sumter.

1:42:44.884 --> 1:42:46.050
You couldn't be against someone

1:42:46.143 --> 1:42:47.827
getting food or
water, could you?

1:42:47.978 --> 1:42:49.829
He puts the
Confederacy in a vine.

1:42:49.980 --> 1:42:52.573
If they allow the ship to come
in, the stalemate continues.

1:42:52.725 --> 1:42:54.483
If they fire, well then
the Confederacy has fired

1:42:54.577 --> 1:42:55.743
the first shot of the war.

1:42:55.837 --> 1:42:58.820
- The Confederates decide
to ask Major Anderson

1:42:58.840 --> 1:42:59.839
to surrender the fort.

1:43:00.917 --> 1:43:03.250
Anderson says, no.

1:43:03.403 --> 1:43:04.568
- Fire!

1:43:04.587 --> 1:43:07.346
(cannons booming)

1:43:12.353 --> 1:43:15.671
- [Caroline] The Confederates
fire for 36 hours

1:43:15.690 --> 1:43:18.082
until finally the
United States flag

1:43:18.175 --> 1:43:19.859
is lowered within Fort Sumter.

1:43:21.029 --> 1:43:23.696
(dramatic music)

1:43:30.354 --> 1:43:33.039
- Is there any word
on the Powhatan?

1:43:35.101 --> 1:43:37.376
I need to know the minute
Fort Sumter's resupplied.

1:43:42.124 --> 1:43:43.049
- This is for you.

1:43:46.112 --> 1:43:48.888
(suspenseful music)

1:44:10.245 --> 1:44:11.410
- We're at war.

1:44:46.430 --> 1:44:48.114
- [Soldier] Charge!

1:44:48.265 --> 1:44:50.190
(soldiers shouting)

1:44:50.343 --> 1:44:51.933
- I hope you boys all reenlist.

1:44:51.953 --> 1:44:53.101
- [Soldiers] Yeah.

1:44:53.121 --> 1:44:54.120
- 'Cause I need every
single one of you.

1:44:54.271 --> 1:44:55.604
- What can I do for you?

1:44:55.623 --> 1:44:57.848
- It's about that army of yours.

1:44:57.867 --> 1:45:00.518
Came by to find out when you
were intending to use it again?

1:45:00.536 --> 1:45:03.612
- Why don't you leave military
matters to military men?

1:45:03.631 --> 1:45:05.798
- This war has nothing
to do with generals.

1:45:06.025 --> 1:45:08.025
- The rebels fight
on their own land.

1:45:08.118 --> 1:45:09.376
- There's something else too.

1:45:09.529 --> 1:45:11.470
- Make this a war for abolition

1:45:11.697 --> 1:45:14.198
and we'll drive
Kentucky to the rebels.

1:45:14.216 --> 1:45:16.291
It'll lead to
insurrection in the north,

1:45:16.311 --> 1:45:18.794
massacre in the streets.

1:45:18.813 --> 1:45:21.555
And the rebels will
only fight harder.

1:45:21.707 --> 1:45:23.390
Blood will be on your hands.

1:45:23.543 --> 1:45:25.484
- Blood is already on my hands!
