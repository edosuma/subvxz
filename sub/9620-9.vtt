00:01.968 --> 00:03.002
<i>TRUE JACKSON, VP...</i>

00:03.069 --> 00:03.803
[BOOM]

00:03.870 --> 00:06.840
[SCREAMING]

00:06.906 --> 00:08.541
JIMMY.

00:08.608 --> 00:09.309
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

00:09.376 --> 00:10.009
I SHOULDN'T BE JUMPING

00:10.076 --> 00:10.910
INTO YOUR ARMS LIKE THAT.

00:10.977 --> 00:11.778
&gt;&gt; IT'S OKAY.

00:11.845 --> 00:12.479
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT OKAY.

00:12.545 --> 00:16.149
I MEAN, WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

00:16.216 --> 00:20.153
&gt;&gt; TRUE.

00:20.220 --> 00:21.688
&gt;&gt; YES?

00:21.755 --> 00:22.288
&gt;&gt; I DON'T WANNA BE

00:22.355 --> 00:24.691
JUST FRIENDS.

00:24.758 --> 00:28.528
&gt;&gt; OH.

00:28.595 --> 00:29.562
<i>TRUE JACKSON, VP</i>

00:29.629 --> 00:30.363
WAS FILMED IN FRONT

00:30.430 --> 00:32.866
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:32.932 --> 00:36.336
JIMMY, JIMMY, JIMMY.

00:36.403 --> 00:36.936
[LOUD BANG]

00:37.003 --> 00:38.972
JIMMY!

00:39.038 --> 00:41.040
&gt;&gt; HEY, TRUE.

00:41.107 --> 00:42.075
&gt;&gt; HOW'S IT GOING?

00:42.142 --> 00:42.675
&gt;&gt; GOOD.

00:42.742 --> 00:43.276
WHAT'S ALL THE JUNK

00:43.343 --> 00:44.077
IN THE RECEPTION AREA?

00:44.144 --> 00:44.944
&gt;&gt; WE GOT PRANKED BY

00:45.011 --> 00:46.079
SIMON CHRISTINA LAST NIGHT.

00:46.146 --> 00:47.280
HE FILLED THE RECEPTION AREA

00:47.347 --> 00:48.081
WITH MANNEQUINS AND HUNG

00:48.148 --> 00:49.649
A BUNCH OF PURPLE DRAPERY.

00:49.716 --> 00:50.183
&gt;&gt; UNCLE MAX HATES

00:50.250 --> 00:51.117
PURPLE DRAPERY.

00:51.184 --> 00:53.086
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.

00:53.153 --> 00:56.689
&gt;&gt; SO...PRETTY FUN DANCE

00:56.756 --> 00:58.024
THE OTHER NIGHT.

00:58.091 --> 00:59.492
&gt;&gt; YEAH, PRETTY FUN.

00:59.559 --> 01:00.193
&gt;&gt; PUNCH WAS GOOD.

01:00.260 --> 01:00.560
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

01:00.627 --> 01:01.294
&gt;&gt; MUSIC WAS KICKIN'.

01:01.361 --> 01:01.795
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

01:01.861 --> 01:02.595
&gt;&gt; AND THEN THERE WAS THAT PART

01:02.662 --> 01:03.363
WHERE YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO BE

01:03.430 --> 01:03.897
MORE THAN FRIENDS.

01:03.963 --> 01:06.132
REMEMBER THAT PART?

01:06.199 --> 01:08.601
&gt;&gt; YEAH. ABOUT THAT,

01:08.668 --> 01:09.769
I WAS THINKING

01:09.836 --> 01:10.637
MAYBE WE COULD GET SOMETHING

01:10.703 --> 01:11.871
TO EAT SOMETIME.

01:11.938 --> 01:12.639
&gt;&gt; OH, I DON'T KNOW,

01:12.705 --> 01:14.841
BUT I'M FREE TONIGHT!

01:14.908 --> 01:16.576
&gt;&gt; AWESOME, SO AM I.

01:16.643 --> 01:17.477
&gt;&gt; THEN, IT'S A DATE?

01:17.544 --> 01:19.813
&gt;&gt; IT'S A DATE

01:19.879 --> 01:21.247
&gt;&gt; SO!

01:21.314 --> 01:22.649
WHERE DO YOU WANNA GO?

01:22.715 --> 01:23.183
&gt;&gt; I WAS THINKING

01:23.249 --> 01:23.950
WE'D HIT WHISKERS.

01:24.017 --> 01:24.784
&gt;&gt; WHISKERS?

01:24.851 --> 01:25.385
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THAT NEW

01:25.452 --> 01:26.553
CAT-THEME RESTAURANT.

01:26.619 --> 01:27.153
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU DO,

01:27.220 --> 01:28.354
DRINK FROM SAUCERS?

01:28.421 --> 01:29.656
&gt;&gt; UH-HUH.

01:29.722 --> 01:30.690
AND SIT ON SCRATCHING POSTS

01:30.757 --> 01:31.624
WHILE CATS RUB THEIR FACES

01:31.691 --> 01:32.659
AGAINST YOUR LEGS.

01:32.725 --> 01:33.760
AND ONCE AN HOUR THEY LOWER

01:33.827 --> 01:35.061
AN ENORMOUS BALL OF YARN

01:35.128 --> 01:35.829
FROM THE CEILING.

01:35.895 --> 01:39.332
THE PLACE GOES CRAZY.

01:39.399 --> 01:41.100
&gt;&gt; SOUNDS GREAT.

01:41.167 --> 01:42.702
&gt;&gt; OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

01:42.769 --> 01:43.837
HERE'S YOUR MAIL.

01:43.903 --> 01:45.171
&gt;&gt; IS THIS MY NEW TRAMPOLINE?

01:45.238 --> 01:46.172
&gt;&gt; YEP.

01:46.239 --> 01:46.973
I LOVE TRAMPOLINES.

01:47.040 --> 01:47.874
WHEN I WAS A KID,

01:47.941 --> 01:48.875
MY BROTHER AND I INVENTED A GAME

01:48.942 --> 01:49.909
CALLED BASKETLEEN.

01:49.976 --> 01:50.510
IT'S A COMBINATION

01:50.577 --> 01:51.277
OF TRAMPOLINE--

01:51.344 --> 01:51.845
&gt;&gt; BASKETBALL.

01:51.911 --> 01:54.347
&gt;&gt; BASKET WEAVING.

01:54.414 --> 01:55.448
ALTHOUGH NOW THAT YOU SAY IT,

01:55.515 --> 01:56.115
BASKETBALL WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:56.182 --> 01:57.917
PRETTY COOL TOO.

01:57.984 --> 01:58.685
&gt;&gt; HEY, TRUE, STAFF MEETING

01:58.751 --> 02:00.220
IN FIVE MINUTES.

02:00.286 --> 02:00.687
HOW'D IT GO?

02:00.753 --> 02:01.154
&gt;&gt; GREAT.

02:01.221 --> 02:02.589
JIMMY ASKED ME OUT ON A DATE.

02:02.655 --> 02:03.456
&gt;&gt; NOT EVEN!

02:03.523 --> 02:04.390
&gt;&gt; I KNOW, RIGHT?

02:04.457 --> 02:05.859
&gt;&gt; WOW, YOU AND JIMMY,

02:05.925 --> 02:06.826
MORE THAN JUST FRIENDS.

02:06.893 --> 02:07.894
THAT'S HUGE.

02:07.961 --> 02:08.394
&gt;&gt; I KNOW.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.596
&gt;&gt; I JUST HEARD THE NEWS.

02:09.662 --> 02:10.230
I'VE WISHED FOR THIS

02:10.296 --> 02:11.698
MY WHOLE LIFE.

02:11.764 --> 02:12.866
&gt;&gt; YOU WISHED JIMMY AND I

02:12.932 --> 02:14.267
WOULD GO ON A DATE?

02:14.334 --> 02:15.602
&gt;&gt; WHAT? NO.

02:15.668 --> 02:16.169
I WISHED I'D GET

02:16.236 --> 02:16.703
AN AUDITION TO BE

02:16.769 --> 02:18.304
IN THE JUNIOR MAGICIANS' CLUB.

02:18.371 --> 02:22.609
THE J.M.C., Y'ALL!

02:22.675 --> 02:24.043
WHAT'S IN THE BOX?

02:24.110 --> 02:25.311
&gt;&gt; BRAND-NEW TRAMPOLINE.

02:25.378 --> 02:26.412
I KNOW YOU LOVE JUMPING.

02:26.479 --> 02:31.718
&gt;&gt; OH, YOU KNOWS IT.

02:31.784 --> 02:32.552
&gt;&gt; NICE GIVE.

02:32.619 --> 02:36.489
THIS ONE'S A KEEPER.

02:36.556 --> 02:38.258
&gt;&gt; AS YOU CAN SEE BY THIS CHART,

02:38.324 --> 02:39.792
WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT GAINS

02:39.859 --> 02:42.795
IN OUR THIRD CARROT.

02:42.862 --> 02:44.297
&gt;&gt; DID HE JUST SAY CARROT?

02:44.364 --> 02:45.932
&gt;&gt; HOWEVER, OUR COUTURE LINE

02:45.999 --> 02:46.566
HAS EXPERIENCED

02:46.633 --> 02:48.034
A DECRIBBITZ IN SALES.

02:48.101 --> 02:49.869
DECRIBBITZ?!

02:49.936 --> 02:51.004
THIS REPORT IS RIDDLED

02:51.070 --> 02:53.206
WITH TYPOS AND MADE-UP WORDS.

02:53.273 --> 02:54.107
&gt;&gt; UH, MAX, I BELIEVE

02:54.173 --> 02:55.608
I CAN OFFER AN EXPLANATION.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.176
ELLA IN ACCOUNTING BROKE UP

02:57.243 --> 02:59.412
WITH JOSE IN PROOFREADING.

02:59.479 --> 03:00.013
&gt;&gt; THAT WOULD EXPLAIN

03:00.079 --> 03:01.347
WHY OUR EXPANSION HAS DOOPLED

03:01.414 --> 03:03.516
IN FOREIGN MEERKATS.

03:03.583 --> 03:04.183
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION

03:04.250 --> 03:04.884
WE HAD AN OFFICE

03:04.951 --> 03:06.553
NO-DATING POLICY.

03:06.619 --> 03:07.487
&gt;&gt; I DON'T BELIEVE SO.

03:07.554 --> 03:08.821
&gt;&gt; YES. WE INSTITUTED IT

03:08.888 --> 03:10.223
AFTER YOU ASKED THAT INTERN

03:10.290 --> 03:11.491
TO LOAD BOXES INTO YOUR CAR

03:11.558 --> 03:14.427
AND THEN TOOK HIM TO MEXICO.

03:14.494 --> 03:15.495
&gt;&gt; I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA

03:15.562 --> 03:18.131
HE'D FALLEN INTO THE TRUNK.

03:18.197 --> 03:18.898
AND BESIDES, I DON'T BELIEVE

03:18.965 --> 03:20.500
A MEMO EVER WENT OUT.

03:20.567 --> 03:21.968
&gt;&gt; MAYBE BECAUSE BENITA IN LEGAL

03:22.035 --> 03:23.636
STARTED DATING JIM IN MEMOS.

03:23.703 --> 03:24.504
&gt;&gt; THAT'S IT!

03:24.571 --> 03:25.471
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY,

03:25.538 --> 03:27.040
ALL EMPLOYEES ARE BANNED

03:27.106 --> 03:38.985
FROM DATING EACH OTHER.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.320
&gt;&gt; MR. MADIGAN, I'M JUST A KID,

03:40.386 --> 03:41.020
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE

03:41.087 --> 03:41.988
A COMPANY CAN'T TELL YOU

03:42.055 --> 03:43.289
WHO WE CAN AND CAN'T DATE.

03:43.356 --> 03:44.457
&gt;&gt; FUNNY YOU MENTION THAT, TRUE.

03:44.524 --> 03:45.558
YES, WE CAN.

03:45.625 --> 03:47.393
AND IF ANYONE BREAKS THE RULE,

03:47.460 --> 03:48.494
THEY WILL BE FIRED.

03:48.561 --> 03:49.095
NOW, TO THE NEXT ORDER

03:49.162 --> 03:49.896
OF BUSINESS,

03:49.963 --> 03:51.831
OUR NEW LINE OF EVENING GOONS.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.968
AAH! THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

03:55.034 --> 03:58.972
MEETING ADJOURNED.

03:59.038 --> 03:59.672
&gt;&gt; HEY, TRUE,

03:59.739 --> 04:00.607
I CAN'T WAIT FOR OUR DATE.

04:00.673 --> 04:01.207
&gt;&gt; DATE NUT BREAD

04:01.274 --> 04:02.675

&gt;&gt; MAIL. AHEM, MAIL.

05:01.901 --> 05:02.935
&gt;&gt; SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

05:03.002 --> 05:03.436
&gt;&gt; WE SHOULD GO

05:03.503 --> 05:04.170
TO A SECRET PLACE.

05:04.237 --> 05:05.838
&gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT WHERE?

05:05.905 --> 05:06.706
&gt;&gt; A SECRET PLACE.

05:06.773 --> 05:07.306
IT'S A RESTAURANT

05:07.373 --> 05:08.641
ON 94th STREET.

05:08.708 --> 05:09.275
DON'T LOOK FOR A SIGN

05:09.342 --> 05:10.977
ABOVE THE DOOR

05:11.044 --> 05:15.281
OR A DOOR.

05:15.348 --> 05:16.215
&gt;&gt; HEY, TRUE, HERE'S THE DRESSES

05:16.282 --> 05:17.450
FOR YOUR FASHION-RELATED

05:17.517 --> 05:19.152
WORK FUNCTION.

05:19.218 --> 05:19.952
THEY'RE REALLY FOR YOUR DATE.

05:20.019 --> 05:21.587
THAT WAS JUST CODE.

05:21.654 --> 05:22.588
&gt;&gt; I KNOW, I CRACKED THAT CODE

05:22.655 --> 05:23.056
WHEN I SAW YOU

05:23.122 --> 05:25.158
GETTING ALL WINKY.

05:25.224 --> 05:26.159
THESE ARE PRETTY NICE.

05:26.225 --> 05:27.293
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THE BLUE ONE SAYS,

05:27.360 --> 05:27.927
"HEY, WHAT'S UP?"

05:27.994 --> 05:28.895
AND THE RED ONE'S ALL,

05:28.961 --> 05:29.429
"YOU WANNA DANCE?"

05:29.495 --> 05:30.530
AND THE BLACK ONE SAYS,

05:30.596 --> 05:31.497
"FIX ME."

05:31.564 --> 05:32.799
&gt;&gt; FIX ME?

05:32.865 --> 05:33.466
&gt;&gt; THE ZIPPER'S BROKEN.

05:33.533 --> 05:35.168
THERE'S A NOTE ON THE BACK.

05:35.234 --> 05:35.768
&gt;&gt; I THINK I'LL GO

05:35.835 --> 05:37.570
WITH THE RED ONE.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.138
&gt;&gt; WHO WANTS TO SEE A TRICK?

05:39.205 --> 05:39.806
&gt;&gt; IF IT INVOLVES YOU

05:39.872 --> 05:40.573
MAKING NASTY SOUNDS

05:40.640 --> 05:41.541
WITH YOUR HAND AND YOUR ARMPIT,

05:41.607 --> 05:43.943
WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN IT.

05:44.010 --> 05:44.844
&gt;&gt; IT DOES NOT,

05:44.911 --> 05:46.879
ALTHOUGH THAT REMAINS A CLASSIC.

05:46.946 --> 05:48.047
&gt;&gt; PRESTO BRAND MAGIC HANDCUFFS.

05:48.114 --> 05:49.415
ONLY 49 CENTS.

05:49.482 --> 05:50.116
&gt;&gt; WHERE'D YOU GET THEM?

05:50.183 --> 05:51.350
&gt;&gt; 49 CENTS STORE.

05:51.417 --> 05:52.485
&gt;&gt; THAT PLACE IS THE WORST.

05:52.552 --> 05:53.019
MY MOM ONCE BOUGHT

05:53.086 --> 05:54.053
A KNOCK-OFF VALENTINE McDOUGAL

05:54.120 --> 05:54.987
T-SHIRT THERE.

05:55.054 --> 05:57.256
IT SAID "VALENPINE McSHMOUGAL."

05:57.323 --> 05:57.857
&gt;&gt; STILL, YOU CAN GET

05:57.924 --> 05:58.891
SOME GREAT BARGAINS.

05:58.958 --> 06:01.728
CHECK OUT MY NEW ROLLER SKATES.

06:01.794 --> 06:02.729
&gt;&gt; THOSE ARE SNEAKERS.

06:02.795 --> 06:04.530
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THE WHEELS FELL OFF.

06:04.597 --> 06:05.098
&gt;&gt; THAT REMINDS ME.

06:05.164 --> 06:05.798
DID YOU READ THAT CHAPTER

06:05.865 --> 06:06.933
FOR HISTORY CLASS?

06:06.999 --> 06:07.800
&gt;&gt; HOW DOES THAT REMIND YOU

06:07.867 --> 06:09.135
OF HISTORY CLASS?

06:09.202 --> 06:09.702
&gt;&gt; WE'RE STUDYING

06:09.769 --> 06:10.737
HISTORY'S GREATEST MORONS.

06:10.803 --> 06:12.605
&gt;&gt; HA HA, GOOD ONE.

06:12.672 --> 06:14.207
&gt;&gt; NO, WE REALLY ARE.

06:14.273 --> 06:14.841
THIS WEEK'S CHAPTER IS

06:14.907 --> 06:16.142
ON COUNT FREDERICK THE IMBECILE.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.777
&gt;&gt; HE TRIED TO MARRY A CHICKEN.

06:17.844 --> 06:18.344
&gt;&gt; I HAVEN'T READ

06:18.411 --> 06:18.978
THAT CHAPTER YET

06:19.045 --> 06:19.746
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN SO BUSY

06:19.812 --> 06:20.580
WITH WORK.

06:20.646 --> 06:21.147
I'LL GET TO IT

06:21.214 --> 06:23.015
RIGHT AFTER MY DATE.

06:23.082 --> 06:24.117
&gt;&gt; DATE?

06:24.183 --> 06:25.785
&gt;&gt; DATE NUT BREAD.

06:25.852 --> 06:26.719
I WAS TALKING ABOUT

06:26.786 --> 06:27.353
DATE NUT BREAD

06:27.420 --> 06:28.221
IN THE BREAK ROOM.

06:28.287 --> 06:29.155
&gt;&gt; I LOOKED IN THE BREAK ROOM.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.256
THERE WAS NO DATE NUT BREAD.

06:30.323 --> 06:30.757
&gt;&gt; DID YOU LOOK

06:30.823 --> 06:31.290
IN THE BREAK ROOM?

06:31.357 --> 06:33.025
&gt;&gt; I JUST SAID I DID.

06:33.092 --> 06:33.993
ANYWAY, THE FACTORY IS READY

06:34.060 --> 06:35.528
FOR YOUR FINAL FABRIC APPROVAL.

06:35.595 --> 06:36.729
&gt;&gt; THAT'S TODAY?

06:36.796 --> 06:37.897
CAN YOU DO IT FOR ME?

06:37.964 --> 06:38.531
&gt;&gt; AS MUCH AS I'D LOVE

06:38.598 --> 06:39.632
TO DO YOUR WORK,

06:39.699 --> 06:40.900
I'M TOO BUSY PLANNING MY WEDDING

06:40.967 --> 06:42.635
TO PERU'S GREATEST SHORTSTOP,

06:42.702 --> 06:43.302
BROCK CHAMPION.

06:43.369 --> 06:44.504
WHY CAN'T YOU DO IT?

06:44.570 --> 06:45.404
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE I'M DOING SOMETHING.

06:45.471 --> 06:46.439
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

06:46.506 --> 06:48.975
&gt;&gt; UM, NOTHING.

06:49.041 --> 06:49.909
&gt;&gt; JUST TO RECAP,

06:49.976 --> 06:50.910
YOU CAN'T GO TO THE FACTORY

06:50.977 --> 06:51.778
BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO BUSY

06:51.844 --> 06:52.979
NOT DOING ANYTHING.

06:53.045 --> 06:53.846
&gt;&gt; OH, THAT'S CORRECT.

06:53.913 --> 06:54.547
&gt;&gt; MAKES SENSE TO ME.

06:54.614 --> 06:55.982
&gt;&gt; ME TOO.

06:56.048 --> 06:58.151
&gt;&gt; HAVE FUN AT THE FACTORY, YES?

06:58.217 --> 06:59.018
&gt;&gt; LULU, CAN YOU COME

06:59.085 --> 06:59.886
TO THE FACTORY WITH ME

06:59.952 --> 07:00.386
JUST IN CASE

07:00.453 --> 07:01.454
THERE'S A LOT OF PAPERWORK.

07:01.521 --> 07:02.188
AND, RYAN, TELL JIMMY

07:02.255 --> 07:03.823
I'LL MEET HIM AT A SECRET PLACE.

07:03.890 --> 07:04.657
&gt;&gt; WHERE?

07:04.724 --> 07:05.491
&gt;&gt; A SECRET PLACE.

07:05.558 --> 07:06.492
&gt;&gt; WHERE?

07:06.559 --> 07:07.193
&gt;&gt; THE RESTAURANT'S CALLED

07:07.260 --> 07:08.127
A SECRET PLACE.

07:08.194 --> 07:09.495
&gt;&gt; OH, I'VE BEEN THERE.

07:09.562 --> 07:10.363
IT WAS AWFUL.

07:10.429 --> 07:10.963
&gt;&gt; LULU!

07:11.030 --> 07:11.664
&gt;&gt; NO, IT USED TO BE

07:11.731 --> 07:12.832
CALLED AWFUL.

07:12.899 --> 07:13.366
I WONDER WHY THEY

07:13.432 --> 07:20.506
CHANGED THE NAME?

07:20.573 --> 07:21.374
&gt;&gt; HEY, JIMMY,

07:21.440 --> 07:21.974
TRUE NEEDS TO MEET YOU

07:22.041 --> 07:23.142
AT A SECRET PLACE.

07:23.209 --> 07:24.076
IT'S A RESTAURANT.

07:24.143 --> 07:25.545
&gt;&gt; I KNOW. THANKS.

07:25.611 --> 07:26.879
&gt;&gt; WOW, NICE TIE.

07:26.946 --> 07:27.480
&gt;&gt; IT'S THE MADIGAN

07:27.547 --> 07:28.147
FIRST DATE TIE.

07:28.214 --> 07:28.915
IT'S BEEN IN OUR FAMILY

07:28.981 --> 07:30.550
FOR SEVEN GENERATIONS.

07:30.616 --> 07:31.284
&gt;&gt; I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE

07:31.350 --> 07:32.485
KETCHUP ON IT.

07:32.552 --> 07:33.119
&gt;&gt; NOPE, THAT'S BLOOD

07:33.186 --> 07:34.821
FROM THE CIVIL WAR.

07:34.887 --> 07:35.988
&gt;&gt; YOU WANNA SEE A MAGIC TRICK?

07:36.055 --> 07:36.756
I GOT A BIG AUDITION

07:36.823 --> 07:37.456
TO BE IN THE J.M.C.

07:37.523 --> 07:37.990
I NEED TO KNOW

07:38.057 --> 07:39.225
IF THIS TRICK IS CONVINCING.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.226
&gt;&gt; OKAY, MAKE IT QUICK.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.394
I'M IN A HURRY.

07:41.460 --> 07:41.928
&gt;&gt; GOOD EVENING,

07:41.994 --> 07:44.130
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

07:44.197 --> 07:45.565
HOW ARE WE ALL DOING TONIGHT?

07:45.631 --> 07:47.099
&gt;&gt; TERRIFIC.

07:47.166 --> 07:48.034
&gt;&gt; LEGEND HAS IT

07:48.100 --> 07:49.035
THAT A WIZARD NAMED ELGOR--

07:49.101 --> 07:51.871
&gt;&gt; PICK IT UP.

07:51.938 --> 07:56.943
&gt;&gt; ABRACADABRA ALAN KAZAM!

07:57.009 --> 07:58.444
&gt;&gt; PRETTY COOL.

07:58.511 --> 08:02.782
BUT WHAT'S THE TRICK?

08:02.849 --> 08:04.217
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

08:04.283 --> 08:05.484
&gt;&gt; MAGIC, MY FRIEND.

08:05.551 --> 08:06.285
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.

08:06.352 --> 08:07.253
NOW WHERE'S THE KEY?

08:07.320 --> 08:08.120
&gt;&gt; OH, THERE IS NO KEY.

08:08.187 --> 08:08.721
YOU JUST TUG ON 'EM

08:08.788 --> 08:15.127
AND THEY OPEN.

08:15.194 --> 08:17.496
&gt;&gt; SERIOUSLY?

08:17.563 --> 08:21.801
NOT THE TIE, NOT THE TIE.

08:21.868 --> 08:22.602
&gt;&gt; OKAY, YOU GO THAT WAY,

08:22.668 --> 08:24.270
I'LL GO THIS WAY.

08:24.337 --> 08:28.808
&gt;&gt; OOH!

08:28.875 --> 08:29.375
&gt;&gt; SO THAT'S WHY

08:29.442 --> 08:30.743
THEY WERE 49 CENTS.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.111
&gt;&gt; I'M GONNA KILL YOU.

08:32.178 --> 08:32.511
&gt;&gt; RELAX.

08:32.578 --> 08:33.613
WE'LL JUST GO BACK TO THE STORE

08:33.679 --> 08:34.213
AND HAVE THEM FREE US

08:34.280 --> 08:35.882
BEFORE YOUR DATE.

08:35.948 --> 08:36.349
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

08:36.415 --> 08:37.483
&gt;&gt; LET ME JUST HIT THE CAN.

08:37.550 --> 08:38.117
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING

08:38.184 --> 08:39.452
ON DOING THERE?

08:39.518 --> 08:48.227
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE IT.

08:48.294 --> 08:48.794
&gt;&gt; THANKS FOR COMING

08:48.861 --> 08:49.295
WITH ME, LULU.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.062
&gt;&gt; NO PROBLEM.

08:50.129 --> 08:50.897
&gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH WE'RE IN A HURRY,

08:50.963 --> 08:51.530
WE SHOULD TAKE OUR TIME

08:51.597 --> 08:52.431
PICKING OUT JUST

08:52.498 --> 08:53.366
THE RIGHT FABRIC,

08:53.432 --> 08:54.800
THESE THINGS CAN'T BE RUSHED.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.036
THE RED ONE, LET'S GO.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.337
&gt;&gt; HELLO, LADIES.

08:58.404 --> 08:59.572
&gt;&gt; MR. MADIGAN?!

08:59.639 --> 09:00.373
&gt;&gt; HOW'S THE FABRIC APPROVAL

09:00.439 --> 09:01.073
GOING?

09:01.140 --> 09:02.308
&gt;&gt; GREAT. I JUST FINISHED.

09:02.375 --> 09:02.875
&gt;&gt; OH, GOOD.

09:02.942 --> 09:03.976
WELL, AS LONG AS YOU'RE HERE,

09:04.043 --> 09:05.144
YOU CAN HELP ME PICK OUT BUTTONS

09:05.211 --> 09:05.778
FOR A BLAZER

09:05.845 --> 09:07.013
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON.

09:07.079 --> 09:08.114
&gt;&gt; WE'D LOVE TO.

09:08.180 --> 09:14.220
&gt;&gt; THESE ARE MY TOP 1,000.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.956
&gt;&gt; YOU SAID WHAT NOW?

09:17.023 --> 09:17.456
&gt;&gt; I'M SORRY.

09:17.523 --> 09:18.624
ARE YOU IN A HURRY?

09:18.691 --> 09:19.825
&gt;&gt; KIND OF.

09:19.892 --> 09:20.826
LULU AND I ARE JUST HEADED OUT

09:20.893 --> 09:21.527
TO GET SOME DINNER.

09:21.594 --> 09:24.096
&gt;&gt; OH, FABULOUS, I'LL COME WITH.

09:24.163 --> 09:24.797
&gt;&gt; SHOULDN'T YOU GO HOME

09:24.864 --> 09:25.965
AND HAVE DINNER WITH YOUR WIFE?

09:26.032 --> 09:26.999
&gt;&gt; WELL, DORIS IS SPENDING

09:27.066 --> 09:27.533
ANOTHER NIGHT OUT

09:27.600 --> 09:28.534
WITH THE GIRLS.

09:28.601 --> 09:29.201
IT'S A LITTLE ANNOYING,

09:29.268 --> 09:30.403
BUT SHE'S JUST TOO CUTE

09:30.469 --> 09:31.470
TO GET MAD AT.

09:31.537 --> 09:32.238
NOW, WHERE ARE WE GOING

09:32.305 --> 09:33.339
FOR DINNER?

09:33.406 --> 09:34.140
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK YOU'D LIKE

09:34.206 --> 09:35.041
WHERE WE'RE GOING.

09:35.107 --> 09:36.142
&gt;&gt; SURE, I WOULD.

09:36.208 --> 09:37.176
&gt;&gt; THAT NEW PLACE, WHISKERS,

09:37.243 --> 09:38.110
THE CAT RESTAURANT.

09:38.177 --> 09:38.778
&gt;&gt; I'M SORRY,

09:38.844 --> 09:39.378
IT ALMOST SOUNDED LIKE

09:39.445 --> 09:40.746
YOU SAID "CAT RESTAURANT."

09:40.813 --> 09:41.881
&gt;&gt; IT'S KIND OF A GIMMICK.

09:41.948 --> 09:42.682
THEY HAVE A HUNDRED CATS

09:42.748 --> 09:43.449
RUNNING AROUND,

09:43.516 --> 09:45.351
CLIMBING ALL OVER YOUR FOOD.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.686
YOU DRINK FROM SAUCERS.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.154
&gt;&gt; SWEET CAESAR'S BUCKET.

09:48.220 --> 09:50.623
&gt;&gt; SOUNDS GROSS, RIGHT?

09:50.690 --> 09:52.024
&gt;&gt; NO. IT SOUNDS FANTASTIC.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.159
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO EAT

09:53.225 --> 09:53.993
LIKE A CAT.

09:54.060 --> 09:54.860
I'LL GET MY COAT.

09:54.927 --> 10:04.904
&gt;&gt; WE'LL WAIT RIGHT HERE.

10:04.971 --> 10:05.738
&gt;&gt; IS THERE A REASON YOU CLIMBED

10:05.805 --> 10:06.639
OVER THE TURNSTILE

10:06.706 --> 10:07.907
INSTEAD OF PAYING?

10:07.974 --> 10:09.542
&gt;&gt; NO ONE PAYS FOR THE SUBWAY.

10:09.608 --> 10:10.843
IT'S JUST A SUGGESTED DONATION,

10:10.910 --> 10:12.645
LIKE WHEN YOU GO TO A MUSEUM

10:12.712 --> 10:14.513
OR THE MOVIES.

10:14.580 --> 10:15.614
&gt;&gt; IF WE WEREN'T IN SUCH A HURRY

10:15.681 --> 10:16.515
I'D EXPLAIN ALL THE THINGS WRONG

10:16.582 --> 10:17.583
WITH THAT SENTENCE.

10:17.650 --> 10:18.351
&gt;&gt; TAKE IT EASY.

10:18.417 --> 10:19.018
WHAT'S THE WORST

10:19.085 --> 10:20.152
THAT COULD HAPPEN?

10:20.219 --> 10:23.322
&gt;&gt; HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

10:23.389 --> 10:24.190
&gt;&gt; LET ME HANDLE THIS.

10:24.256 --> 10:25.691
&gt;&gt; I WISH YOU WOULDN'T.

10:25.758 --> 10:26.425
&gt;&gt; THOUGHT YOU COULD GET AWAY

10:26.492 --> 10:28.060
WITHOUT PAYING, HUH?

10:28.127 --> 10:28.861
&gt;&gt; NOT AT ALL.

10:28.928 --> 10:29.528
MY FRIEND PAID

10:29.595 --> 10:30.529
AND SINCE WE'RE ESSENTIALLY

10:30.596 --> 10:32.231
ONE PERSON,

10:32.298 --> 10:34.266
WE ONLY HAVE TO PAY ONE FARE.

10:34.333 --> 10:34.967
&gt;&gt; I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT

10:35.034 --> 10:36.969
LIKE THAT.

10:37.036 --> 10:38.004
YOU CAN GO.

10:38.070 --> 10:38.771
&gt;&gt; REALLY?

10:38.838 --> 10:40.172
&gt;&gt; NO.

10:40.239 --> 10:41.907
I'M TAKING YOU BOTH DOWNTOWN.

10:41.974 --> 10:42.641
&gt;&gt; GREAT. CAN THIS DAY

10:42.708 --> 10:43.576
GET ANY WORSE?

10:43.642 --> 10:45.144
&gt;&gt; OOH, I GOTTA HIT THE CAN

10:45.211 --> 10:55.021
BEFORE WE GO.

10:55.087 --> 10:55.821
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T THINK IT WAS WRONG

10:55.888 --> 10:57.423
WE DITCHED MR. MADIGAN, DO YOU?

10:57.490 --> 10:58.991
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE I DO.

10:59.058 --> 10:59.725
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS NOT THE ANSWER

10:59.792 --> 11:01.193
I WAS LOOKING FOR.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.729
&gt;&gt; I MEAN, NOT AT ALL.

11:03.796 --> 11:04.697
RIGHT NOW THE MOST IMPORTANT

11:04.764 --> 11:05.297
THING IS TO GET YOU

11:05.364 --> 11:06.165
TO YOUR DATE WITH JIMMY.

11:06.232 --> 11:07.800
&gt;&gt; STILL, I FEEL KINDA BAD.

11:07.867 --> 11:08.601
POOR MR. MADIGAN,

11:08.667 --> 11:09.568
ALL ALONE IN THE FACTORY,

11:09.635 --> 11:11.404
WONDERING WHERE WE WENT.

11:11.470 --> 11:13.839
&gt;&gt; AH! THERE YOU GIRLS ARE.

11:13.906 --> 11:15.174
NOW, WHO'S READY TO GO

11:15.241 --> 11:16.509
TO WHISKERS?

11:16.575 --> 11:18.544
I KNOW I AM.

11:18.611 --> 11:21.113
PURR.

11:21.180 --> 11:21.881
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN WAIT

11:21.947 --> 11:22.882
FOR THE RESTAURANT.

11:22.948 --> 11:24.717
I'M REALLY HUNGRY FOR A PRETZEL.

11:24.784 --> 11:25.518
&gt;&gt; THERE'S A PRETZEL STAND

11:25.584 --> 11:26.552
UPSTAIRS.

11:26.619 --> 11:26.952
&gt;&gt; REALLY?

11:27.019 --> 11:28.154
YOU'LL GET ONE FOR ME?

11:28.220 --> 11:40.132
&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T SAY THAT, BUT OKAY.

11:40.199 --> 11:42.168
&gt;&gt; HELLO? IS ANYBODY HERE?

11:42.234 --> 11:42.968
&gt;&gt; DORIS?

11:43.035 --> 11:44.370
&gt;&gt; WHERE IS EVERYONE?

11:44.437 --> 11:46.572
&gt;&gt; THE WORKDAY IS OVER, DORIS.

11:46.639 --> 11:47.640
FEEL FREE TO MENTION TO MAX

11:47.706 --> 11:48.674
I WAS WORKING LATE,

WHERE WOULD YOU GET THAT?

17:57.576 --> 17:58.510
I'M HERE WITH YOU AND LULU,

17:58.577 --> 17:59.278
AND JIMMY'S WITH RYAN

17:59.344 --> 18:00.913
AND THAT GUY.

18:00.979 --> 18:03.182
&gt;&gt; OFFICER JAKE HOOLEY.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.616
&gt;&gt; IT JUST SEEMS SUSPICIOUS

18:04.683 --> 18:05.384
THAT YOU WOULD MENTION JIMMY

18:05.451 --> 18:06.151
AND THEN A MOMENT LATER,

18:06.218 --> 18:07.085
HE'D WALK IN,

18:07.152 --> 18:08.253
EVEN IF HE IS WITH RYAN

18:08.320 --> 18:09.388
AND THAT GUY.

18:09.455 --> 18:11.990
&gt;&gt; OFFICER JAKE HOOLEY.

18:12.057 --> 18:12.691
&gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT ON A DATE,

18:12.758 --> 18:13.525
UNCLE MAX.

18:13.592 --> 18:14.293
I'M JUST OUT WITH MY BUDDIES,

18:14.359 --> 18:15.327
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS

18:15.394 --> 18:16.829
RESTAURANT'S THREE-FOR-ONE DEAL.

18:16.895 --> 18:17.529
&gt;&gt; THEN WHY ARE YOU WEARING

18:17.596 --> 18:19.598
THE MADIGAN DATING TIE?

18:19.665 --> 18:20.299
&gt;&gt; THIS ISN'T THE MADIGAN

18:20.365 --> 18:22.067
DATING TIE.

18:22.134 --> 18:22.534
&gt;&gt; SURE IT IS.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.770
IT HAS CIVIL WAR KETCHUP ON IT.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.105
[TRUE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]

18:27.172 --> 18:28.440
&gt;&gt; WELL, SINCE WE'RE ALL HERE,

18:28.507 --> 18:29.875
DO YOU GUYS WANNA SIT WITH US?

18:29.942 --> 18:35.848
&gt;&gt; SOUNDS GREAT.

18:35.914 --> 18:36.782
&gt;&gt; ARE THOSE PRESTO BRAND

18:36.849 --> 18:37.883
HANDCUFFS?

18:37.950 --> 18:39.485
I USED TO OWN A PAIR OF THOSE.

18:39.551 --> 18:40.486
&gt;&gt; DID THEY WORK?

18:40.552 --> 18:42.054
&gt;&gt; NO. I SPENT THE BETTER PART

18:42.120 --> 18:42.921
OF LAST WINTER

18:42.988 --> 18:44.122
CUFFED TO MY RADIATOR.

18:44.189 --> 18:45.924
I SURVIVED OFF A SINGLE SLEEVE

18:45.991 --> 18:47.326
OF CRACKERS.

18:47.392 --> 18:50.996
I LOST 40 POUNDS.

18:51.063 --> 18:51.864
&gt;&gt; CAN I START YOU FOLKS

18:51.930 --> 18:52.698
WITH SOMETHING?

18:52.764 --> 18:53.499
&gt;&gt; YEAH, WE'D LIKE

18:53.565 --> 18:54.666
A PLATE OF NACHOS,

18:54.733 --> 18:55.634
SOME SELTZER WATER,

18:55.701 --> 18:57.002
AND A HATCHET.

18:57.069 --> 19:03.842
&gt;&gt; ONE NUMBER SIX, COMING UP.

19:03.909 --> 19:05.043
&gt;&gt; BROCK WANTS A BASEBALL THEME

19:05.110 --> 19:05.677
FOR THE WEDDING,

19:05.744 --> 19:06.478
AND I WAS THINKING

19:06.545 --> 19:07.045
MORE ALONG THE LINES

19:07.112 --> 19:10.616
OF NO BASEBALL THEME WHATSOEVER.

19:10.682 --> 19:12.184
&gt;&gt; AMANDA, WEDDINGS ARE MADE UP

19:12.251 --> 19:13.752
OF IDEAS THAT ARE DIFFERENT,

19:13.819 --> 19:15.087
BUT BLEND TOGETHER.

19:15.153 --> 19:16.688
IT'S LIKE HE'S PEANUT BUTTER

19:16.755 --> 19:17.756
AND YOU'RE SARDINES.

19:17.823 --> 19:18.824
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

19:18.891 --> 19:21.860
&gt;&gt; YEAH. NO.

19:21.927 --> 19:23.028
&gt;&gt; TWO THINGS THAT DON'T SOUND

19:23.095 --> 19:23.729
LIKE THEY'RE GONNA TASTE

19:23.795 --> 19:24.396
GOOD TOGETHER,

19:24.463 --> 19:25.764
BUT THEN ONCE YOU TRY THEM,

19:25.831 --> 19:26.832
IT'S ALL YOU EVER WANT TO EAT

19:26.899 --> 19:28.133
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

19:28.200 --> 19:28.667
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU SAYING

19:28.734 --> 19:30.068
THAT'S ALL YOU EAT,

19:30.135 --> 19:31.503
PEANUT BUTTER AND SARDINES?

19:31.570 --> 19:35.007
&gt;&gt; UH-HUH, AND CHEESE.

19:35.073 --> 19:38.610
OH, THIS IS GOOD.

19:38.677 --> 19:39.177
CHEESE BRAIN?

19:39.244 --> 19:39.578
&gt;&gt; MM-MM.

19:39.645 --> 19:40.012
&gt;&gt; YOU MUST.

19:40.078 --> 19:40.479
&gt;&gt; I'LL PASS.

19:40.546 --> 19:42.281
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.415
&gt;&gt; THANKS FOR DINNER, UNCLE MAX.

19:43.482 --> 19:43.982
AND YOU WERE RIGHT.

19:44.049 --> 19:44.917
THE SWEETHEART DESSERT FOR TWO

19:44.983 --> 19:48.287
WAS MUCH BETTER SPLIT SIX WAYS.

19:48.353 --> 19:49.721
&gt;&gt; I GUESS I'LL BE HEADING HOME.

19:49.788 --> 19:51.456
&gt;&gt; I'M GOING THAT DIRECTION.

19:51.523 --> 19:52.424
I'LL WALK YOU.

19:52.491 --> 19:53.892
&gt;&gt; THAT'D BE GREAT.

19:53.959 --> 19:54.993
&gt;&gt; I NEED TO WALK OFF DINNER.

19:55.060 --> 19:57.963
I'LL COME WITH.

19:58.030 --> 20:05.737
I JUST HAVE TO WASH MY HANDS.

20:05.804 --> 20:07.706
&gt;&gt; WE'RE FINALLY ALONE.

20:07.773 --> 20:08.340
&gt;&gt; THAT HAD TO HAVE BEEN

20:08.407 --> 20:09.875
THE WORLD'S WORST FIRST DATE.

20:09.942 --> 20:10.542
&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT MY PARENTS'

20:10.609 --> 20:11.610
FIRST DATE WAS BAD.

20:11.677 --> 20:12.311
THEY GOT STUCK ON TOP

20:12.377 --> 20:13.178
OF A FERRIS WHEEL

20:13.245 --> 20:13.879
AND MY MOM WAS ALL,

20:13.946 --> 20:16.381
"CLIMB DOWN AND SAVE US, LARRY!"

20:16.448 --> 20:16.915
THAT WAS THE NIGHT

20:16.982 --> 20:19.585
MY DAD BROKE BOTH HIS LEGS.

20:19.651 --> 20:20.085
&gt;&gt; WE CAN STILL

20:20.152 --> 20:21.053
TURN THIS NIGHT AROUND.

20:21.119 --> 20:23.088
YOU WANNA GO TO HAPPYBERRY?

20:23.155 --> 20:24.256
&gt;&gt; I SHOULD PROBABLY GET HOME.

20:24.323 --> 20:25.824
I'VE GOT SCHOOL TOMORROW.

20:25.891 --> 20:26.858
OH, NO. I STILL HAVE

20:26.925 --> 20:28.293
A WHOLE CHAPTER TO READ.

20:28.360 --> 20:28.961
&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH, AND I HAVE TO

20:29.027 --> 20:29.695
GET BACK TO THE OFFICE

20:29.761 --> 20:30.495
AND FINISH THE MAIL RUN

20:30.562 --> 20:31.330
I SKIPPED 'CAUSE I WAS

20:31.396 --> 20:33.231
GETTING READY FOR TONIGHT.

20:33.298 --> 20:33.899
&gt;&gt; THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST

20:33.966 --> 20:35.767
EXHAUSTING NIGHT OF MY LIFE.

20:35.834 --> 20:36.735
&gt;&gt; TRUE.

20:36.802 --> 20:37.936
&gt;&gt; YES?

20:38.003 --> 20:38.971
&gt;&gt; OH, NO, I WAS AGREEING.

20:39.037 --> 20:40.038
I SHOULD HAVE JUST SAID "YEAH."

20:40.105 --> 20:43.175
SORRY.

20:43.241 --> 20:47.879
WE CAN TRY AGAIN TOMORROW NIGHT.

20:47.946 --> 20:49.948
&gt;&gt; JIMMY, I DON'T KNOW

20:50.015 --> 20:54.653
IF I'M READY TO DO THIS.

20:54.720 --> 20:55.387
AND I LIKE YOU TOO MUCH

20:55.454 --> 20:56.488
TO MESS UP WHAT WE COULD HAVE

20:56.555 --> 20:59.758
BECAUSE I COULDN'T GIVE US 100%.

20:59.825 --> 21:01.460
&gt;&gt; THEN MAYBE WE SHOULD WAIT.

21:01.526 --> 21:03.729
YOU KNOW, UNTIL A BETTER TIME.

21:03.795 --> 21:05.697
&gt;&gt; IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU?

21:05.764 --> 21:06.131
&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY,

21:06.198 --> 21:07.599
I'M KIND OF RELIEVED.

21:07.666 --> 21:08.166
MY STOMACH'S BEEN

21:08.233 --> 21:08.700
IN KNOTS ALL DAY

21:08.767 --> 21:10.035
ABOUT LYING TO UNCLE MAX.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.003
&gt;&gt; YEAH, IT'S PRETTY AMAZING

21:11.069 --> 21:12.871
WE WERE ABLE TO FOOL HIM.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.940
&gt;&gt; HI, KIDS.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.241
YOU TWO AREN'T ON A DATE,

21:16.308 --> 21:17.809
ARE YOU?

21:17.876 --> 21:21.546
&gt;&gt; NO, WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.181
&gt;&gt; GOOD FRIENDS.

21:23.248 --> 21:24.449
&gt;&gt; WELL, THIS HAS BEEN

21:24.516 --> 21:34.226
A FUN NIGHT.

21:34.292 --> 21:35.594
&gt;&gt; OKAY, OKAY, OKAY,

21:35.661 --> 21:36.428
BEFORE WE PLAY OUR FIRST GAME

21:36.495 --> 21:37.329
OF BASKETLEEN,

21:37.396 --> 21:38.096
I WANNA THANK JIMMY

21:38.163 --> 21:41.566
FOR WEAVING THE BASKET.

21:41.633 --> 21:42.167
OOH.

21:42.234 --> 21:43.835
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

21:43.902 --> 21:45.804
&gt;&gt; KIDS, HAVE YOU SEEN MAX?

21:45.871 --> 21:46.838
&gt;&gt; NO.

21:46.905 --> 21:48.640
&gt;&gt; AND WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

21:48.707 --> 21:50.709
&gt;&gt; YOU LIKE IT?

21:50.776 --> 21:51.476
I'M JUST PLAYING

21:51.543 --> 21:52.310
WITH SOME NOTIONS

21:52.377 --> 21:53.278
FOR MY WEDDING DRESS.

21:53.345 --> 21:53.812
WE'RE THINKING

21:53.879 --> 21:56.014
OF AN UPSCALE BASEBALL THEME.

21:56.081 --> 21:56.848
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU SERVING,

21:56.915 --> 21:58.450
HOT DOGS AND CAVIAR?

21:58.517 --> 21:59.084
&gt;&gt; NOW WE ARE.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.720
SOMEONE WRITE THAT DOWN.

22:01.787 --> 22:02.521
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T WANT US

22:02.587 --> 22:04.189
TO BE BRIDESMAIDS, DO YOU?

22:04.256 --> 22:05.791
&gt;&gt; HA! [SNORTS] OF COURSE NOT.

22:05.857 --> 22:06.892
UNLESS YOU WANT TO.

22:06.958 --> 22:13.865
&gt;&gt; WE'D LOVE TO.

22:13.932 --> 22:14.933
&gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO BRAG,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.936
BUT MY HEAD IS DELICIOUS.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.638
HERE, HAVE THE REST.

22:19.705 --> 22:20.605
&gt;&gt; TRUE, DID YOU SPEND

22:20.672 --> 22:21.206
COMPANY MONEY

22:21.273 --> 22:24.142
TO BUY A TRAMPOLINE?

22:24.209 --> 22:24.810
&gt;&gt; YES.

22:24.876 --> 22:26.378
&gt;&gt; GREAT IDEA!

22:26.445 --> 22:29.014
I WANT ONE FOR MY OFFICE.

22:29.081 --> 22:30.649
&gt;&gt; NOW, LET ME SHOW YOU KIDS

22:30.716 --> 22:31.883
THE MOVES THAT GOT ME ONTO

22:31.950 --> 22:42.961
THE VARSITY BASKETLEEN TEAM.
