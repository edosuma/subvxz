00:04.041 --> 00:05.041
Previously on E. R.

00:05.042 --> 00:08.577
No, you cannot leave. Fainting can be a
warning sign for heart attack, for stroke.

00:08.612 --> 00:09.638
I'll take my chances.

00:09.739 --> 00:11.245
- Luka got me a job.
- Oh, he did?

00:11.346 --> 00:13.161
Is she, like, your girlfriend now?

00:14.093 --> 00:15.577
I got her a job, that's all.

00:15.578 --> 00:17.920
What was I thinking
when I said I'd come back?

00:17.921 --> 00:18.721
You weren't.

00:18.722 --> 00:20.385
Reece has one father,
and that's me.

00:20.586 --> 00:22.416
We both know that's not true,
don't we?

00:22.617 --> 00:26.201
Four people are dead. I was their doctor,
and I can't explain what happened.

00:26.576 --> 00:29.357
Well, the answer certainly isn't
that you were euthanizing people.

00:29.458 --> 00:30.926
Am I being accused of something here?

00:31.027 --> 00:34.336
You wouldn't be the first angel
of mercy to help end patients' suffering.

00:54.298 --> 00:55.542
- Sign in.
- Actually-

00:55.714 --> 00:57.870
- Where are our T-sheets?
- I'm a new med student.

00:58.047 --> 00:59.226
Congratulations.

00:59.305 --> 01:01.163
You said that yesterday.

01:01.337 --> 01:03.660
- Check in with the docs.
- Okay, thanks.

01:03.837 --> 01:07.082
- Do you guys have a lost-and-found box?
- Somebody stole it.

01:09.668 --> 01:11.705
Excuse me, ma'am.
Are you Dr. Carter?

01:11.876 --> 01:15.157
Lewis. I don't think he's in yet.
And I'm not old enough to be a ma'am.

01:15.333 --> 01:18.827
- I'm supposed to meet him around 8.
- You're a tad early.

01:18.998 --> 01:21.829
Yeah, it's my first day.
I guess I was a little excited.

01:21.997 --> 01:24.070
You'll get over it.

01:24.246 --> 01:27.824
So Mr. Hopper,
what seems to be the problem?

01:27.995 --> 01:31.608
I can't eat. I can't sleep.
I just don't feel like myself.

01:31.785 --> 01:35.150
- How long has this been going on?
- A few weeks.

01:35.534 --> 01:39.230
Any stress? Family? Work?

01:39.408 --> 01:42.855
All my problems started when
I met this girl at an after-hours bar.

01:43.032 --> 01:45.697
- She bit me.
- She bit you where?

01:45.864 --> 01:47.356
In the alley outside the club-

01:47.530 --> 01:50.811
- No, where on your body?
- My neck.

01:51.362 --> 01:53.814
I'm pretty sure she was a vampire.

01:54.111 --> 01:55.390
That's a hickey.

01:55.569 --> 01:58.021
- Is that a zygoma fracture?
- Maybe.

01:58.193 --> 02:00.562
- Are you Dr. Carter?
- Nope, Greene.

02:00.734 --> 02:03.980
I'm Michael Gallant.
I'm supposed to be meeting Dr. Carter.

02:04.149 --> 02:06.104
You found the ER.
That's half the battle.

02:06.274 --> 02:08.643
- You called for surgical consult!
- I changed my mind.

02:08.814 --> 02:10.058
After I got down here.

02:10.146 --> 02:12.267
He has rectal pain. Probably prostatitis.

02:12.438 --> 02:14.014
That's why I need to examine him.

02:14.188 --> 02:16.805
If it is an appy,
he's probably going to need surgery.

02:16.978 --> 02:18.767
- Somebody need a second opinion?
- Nope.

02:18.936 --> 02:22.300
Yes! He has a 22-year-old
male with right-sided tenderness.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.632
Who also says it burns when he pees.

02:24.809 --> 02:27.095
- What's his urine and white count?
- Still waiting.

02:27.266 --> 02:29.470
Usually you won't even come
till labs are back.

02:29.641 --> 02:32.128
Fine. When it bursts, you can operate.

02:32.306 --> 02:34.047
- Hey, Dr. Carter?
- Kovac.

02:34.222 --> 02:36.094
- Dr. Kovac.
- Hold on. Elizabeth!

02:36.305 --> 02:37.584
What's going on?

02:37.763 --> 02:38.959
- Isn't it obvious?
- No.

02:39.137 --> 02:41.707
He calls for a surgical consult,
then changes his mind...

02:41.886 --> 02:45.464
- ... the moment he sees it's me!
- That's a bit egocentric, don't you think?

02:45.635 --> 02:47.424
They're afraid to have me
treat their patients.

02:47.634 --> 02:48.831
You're being paranoid.

02:49.009 --> 02:50.631
Am I?

02:51.050 --> 02:53.538
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Do you know where Dr. Carter is?

02:53.716 --> 02:56.362
- He should be here in a few minutes.
- Listen, I know you're really busy.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.951
- If you say where he is, I could find him.
- I don't know. Sorry.

02:59.130 --> 03:01.499
- How come there aren't any doughnuts?
- No petty cash.

03:01.671 --> 03:03.460
There was 50 bucks in there
yesterday.

03:03.629 --> 03:06.993
I need a psych consult.
My patient thinks he's a vampire.

03:07.169 --> 03:09.574
Count Fred? Where is he?

03:09.793 --> 03:11.665
- Exam 2.
- Is there a nurse in with him?

03:11.834 --> 03:14.582
- No, why?
- He's a vampire.

03:14.750 --> 03:17.320
- What do you mean?
- I mean, he drinks people's blood.

03:17.499 --> 03:19.324
You're kidding, right?

03:23.664 --> 03:25.737
That's nasty.

04:16.838 --> 04:20.586
But I volunteered to drive to the
Royal Botanical Gardens fundraiser.

04:20.757 --> 04:23.297
I'm sorry, but there's just
not much I can do about it.

04:23.470 --> 04:25.378
You can stop lying to me.

04:25.555 --> 04:27.464
- Good morning.
- Dr. Carter.

04:28.725 --> 04:31.761
- Did I miss something?
- Yes, breakfast.

04:31.936 --> 04:34.724
Your grandmother's upset
because the Jaguar's being serviced.

04:34.897 --> 04:36.143
For a week!

04:36.316 --> 04:39.068
- What's wrong with it?
- Yes, Alger. What's wrong with it?

04:39.235 --> 04:41.275
- They're waiting for a part.
- What part?

04:41.446 --> 04:45.490
- The ignition coil.
- Liar. He's holding me hostage.

04:45.658 --> 04:49.987
- What's the matter with the Town Car?
- I don't drive the Town Car.

04:50.162 --> 04:52.832
You shouldn't be driving anyway.
That's why we have Alger.

04:52.999 --> 04:55.454
Having a driver
was your grandfather's idea.

04:55.627 --> 04:59.494
Now that he's gone,
it seems an unnecessary expense.

04:59.672 --> 05:01.629
He's just trying to look out for you.

05:01.716 --> 05:04.670
I'm a big girl. I don't need a chaperone.

05:04.844 --> 05:08.343
Oh, John, are you still planning
to come with me to-?

05:10.349 --> 05:11.630
Gamma!

05:13.352 --> 05:15.677
- Nurses do most of the triaging, right?
- Right.

05:15.855 --> 05:17.894
So maybe you could sneak me
some minor cases.

05:18.066 --> 05:20.817
Maybe you could sit down...

05:21.485 --> 05:25.317
...read your orientation kit,
and wait for Dr. Carter.

05:25.530 --> 05:28.200
- What's going on?
- Teaching Nicole to take blood pressure.

05:28.367 --> 05:30.027
- Why?
- It's part of her training.

05:30.203 --> 05:32.954
- What training?
- I'm learning to be a nurse's aide.

05:33.122 --> 05:34.402
- Really?
- Abby?

05:34.582 --> 05:36.539
No helmet.
Alert at the scene. GCS-14.

05:36.708 --> 05:38.286
- Any blood loss or seizure?
- No.

05:38.461 --> 05:40.916
Okay, let's get him in Trauma 1.
Nicole, come on.

05:41.088 --> 05:44.374
- Me?
- Yeah, it'll be good for you to watch.

05:47.052 --> 05:48.962
Must've taken a header
off the skateboard.

05:49.138 --> 05:51.510
Bad scalp lac, hematoma,
right peritemporal.

05:51.682 --> 05:54.138
Abby, show Nicole
how to take a pulse ox.

05:58.022 --> 05:59.301
Put some gloves on.

06:03.277 --> 06:05.186
- Can I watch?
- Why don't we sell tickets?

06:05.362 --> 06:07.153
- You a med student?
- Michael Gallant.

06:07.322 --> 06:08.651
- Dr. Finch.
- Nice to meet you.

06:08.824 --> 06:11.778
- Road rash all the way down the chest.
- Big abdominal bruise.

06:12.452 --> 06:14.492
BP's 90 over 60.
Pulse, 115.

06:14.663 --> 06:17.236
Full trauma panel, lateral C-spine,
chest and pelvis.

06:17.416 --> 06:19.242
Jeremy, do you remember
what happened?

06:19.417 --> 06:21.909
Right pupil is sluggish,
slightly larger than the left.

06:22.087 --> 06:23.546
18 gauge in the right AC.

06:23.714 --> 06:25.955
- What's his pulse ox?
- I can't get it.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.294
Abby?

06:29.636 --> 06:32.756
Make sure the fingernail has contact
with that red light.

06:34.224 --> 06:36.015
No CSF or blood from the ears.

06:36.185 --> 06:38.758
100 of fentanyl and page Benton
and Neurosurg.

06:38.937 --> 06:40.930
Read the number off of this monitor.

06:41.106 --> 06:43.264
Decreased breath sounds on the right.

06:43.441 --> 06:45.481
-78.
- What?

06:47.028 --> 06:49.982
Pulse ox is 78 on 15 liters.

06:52.492 --> 06:54.284
Okay. Good job.

06:56.370 --> 06:58.612
- What do you think?
- Hyper-resonant on the right.

06:58.790 --> 07:00.949
Decreased breath sounds,
low sats, hypotension.

07:01.126 --> 07:02.668
Tension pneumothorax, right?

07:04.629 --> 07:06.123
Yeah.

07:07.716 --> 07:10.502
I had a fainting spell, John.
It happens.

07:10.677 --> 07:12.005
But it shouldn't happen.

07:12.179 --> 07:16.306
In my day, it was quite acceptable
for a lady to swoon.

07:16.474 --> 07:19.345
- There's a med student looking for you.
- I'm a little busy.

07:19.518 --> 07:22.354
- Oh, hello, Mrs. Carter.
- Hello.

07:22.521 --> 07:26.270
Hi, Evan. Your mother's on her way.
She found your inhaler in the laundry.

07:26.443 --> 07:29.527
Gam, will you sit up for me,
put your legs over the end of the bed?

07:29.696 --> 07:31.439
Yes, John.

07:31.614 --> 07:34.531
You're not gonna make me
do pushups, are-?

07:34.701 --> 07:38.864
Gam? Gamma? Gamma? Susan.
Gamma, can you hear me?

07:40.539 --> 07:42.033
John?

07:42.375 --> 07:44.451
Okay. You're okay.

07:45.044 --> 07:47.749
I need to step out for a minute.
I'll be right back.

07:52.969 --> 07:54.380
- Checking orthostatics?
- Yeah.

07:54.553 --> 07:57.389
- Is she anemic?
- I don't know.

07:57.556 --> 07:59.383
I'm sending her up for a tilt test.

07:59.559 --> 08:02.560
She might be dehydrated,
it's probably nothing.

08:04.313 --> 08:06.685
- Can I intubate?
- Maybe next time.

08:06.899 --> 08:08.179
What am I looking at?

08:08.358 --> 08:11.526
Teenage skateboarder, tension pneumo
on the left, with a head injury.

08:11.696 --> 08:13.320
Needs a central line.

08:13.489 --> 08:15.944
He's anterior.
I can see the cords. I'm in.

08:16.117 --> 08:17.528
Okay, bag him, Nicole.

08:17.702 --> 08:20.537
Come on.
One, two, three, squeeze.

08:20.705 --> 08:22.199
He did all this on a skateboard?

08:22.373 --> 08:24.910
- Trying a crazy stunt, no doubt.
- Good breath sounds.

08:25.084 --> 08:27.041
Probably has
a depressed skull fracture.

08:27.210 --> 08:29.536
That's what they used to call
a ping-pong fracture?

08:29.713 --> 08:31.920
- Neurosurg is on the way.
- Pressure's dropping.

08:32.091 --> 08:33.549
Okay, he's bleeding somewhere.

08:33.717 --> 08:34.998
How much out in the chest tube?

08:35.094 --> 08:37.217
Less than a liter. First HemoCue is nine.

08:37.346 --> 08:40.133
Let's hang the O-neg. Get him to O.R.
Has he had Dilantin?

08:40.307 --> 08:41.885
Yeah. And 70 grams of mannitol.

08:42.058 --> 08:43.553
What about his head?

08:43.727 --> 08:46.562
- Who are you?
- Michael Gallant. You a trauma surgeon?

08:46.730 --> 08:48.438
- You a med student?
- Yes, sir.

08:48.607 --> 08:52.935
Why don't you find something to do, all
right? Let's get him ready to go. I'm in.

08:53.111 --> 08:56.652
- I'll learn more here.
- You'll learn more with your eyes open...

08:56.687 --> 08:58.570
- ... and your mouth shut, okay?
- He's got a point.

08:58.742 --> 09:00.332
- What about his head?
- Won't make a difference...

09:00.367 --> 09:03.644
if he bleeds out in his chest first.
Okay, let's move.

09:09.044 --> 09:11.914
- You did good.
- Really? I was so scared.

09:12.088 --> 09:15.125
- You get used to it.
- I don't know.

09:15.592 --> 09:18.795
- You saved his life.
- Yeah, I hope so.

09:19.346 --> 09:22.133
Me too. I better go back to work.
I'll see you later.

09:22.307 --> 09:23.801
Okay.

09:25.936 --> 09:27.762
What are you doing?

09:27.937 --> 09:29.479
- What?
- What?

09:29.648 --> 09:32.684
This morning she was learning to take
a BP, now she's in a trauma?

09:32.859 --> 09:35.267
- Yeah, she's learning.
- To be an aide, not a nurse.

09:35.445 --> 09:38.612
- I know you don't like her, but-
- That has nothing to do with this.

09:38.782 --> 09:41.284
It's inappropriate that she be
in trauma and you know it.

09:41.319 --> 09:45.157
- I just asked you to help her.
- That's not my job, Luka.

09:45.330 --> 09:47.821
Do you even realize
what I do in there?

09:48.791 --> 09:51.461
You're not the only one
trying to save that kid's life.

09:52.462 --> 09:55.463
- I'm gonna go ahead and scrub in.
- I'll page Neurosurg again.

09:55.631 --> 09:56.960
- Dr. Benton?
- Yeah?

09:57.133 --> 09:58.793
- Yeah, are you Peter Benton?
- Yeah.

09:58.969 --> 10:01.637
Consider yourself served.
Have a nice day.

10:04.807 --> 10:07.477
What was that about? Peter?

10:07.643 --> 10:11.143
- I'm being subpoenaed.
- For what case?

10:11.314 --> 10:13.520
Reece. Roger's suing for custody.

10:14.358 --> 10:17.645
So how extensive do you think
his brain injury is?

10:17.862 --> 10:20.982
- It's too early to tell.
- How is he?

10:21.157 --> 10:23.196
The skateboarder.
Is he gonna be okay?

10:23.367 --> 10:24.399
Are you his father?

10:24.494 --> 10:26.450
No. I'm David Hilliker. I called 911.

10:26.621 --> 10:27.865
Did you see what happened?

10:28.038 --> 10:31.242
Screwing around in the mall with
buddies. Looked like he hit his head.

10:31.417 --> 10:35.118
- Yeah. He wasn't wearing a helmet.
- Wouldn't be cool. Don't need helmets...

10:35.296 --> 10:37.869
...to drive a motorcycle in this state.
Why a skateboard?

10:38.049 --> 10:39.757
- You got a little limp.
- Oh, yeah.

10:39.925 --> 10:42.595
I twisted it chasing him
and his buddy out of the mall.

10:42.762 --> 10:47.174
- You should let us look at it. Come on.
- Ice pack and a couple beers, I'll be fine.

10:47.349 --> 10:49.092
Sit down.

10:49.268 --> 10:52.850
- We just need to change the dressing.
- But Dr. Carter usually does that.

10:53.022 --> 10:55.560
I'm aware of that,
but Dr. Carter's not here right now.

10:55.733 --> 10:58.189
- We'll wait.
- I don't know when he'll be in.

10:58.361 --> 11:00.353
- I'm very patient.
- Look, Sister.

11:00.530 --> 11:02.024
Helen.

11:02.198 --> 11:05.481
- The sooner I change the bandage...
- I'm Monica.

11:05.868 --> 11:09.782
...the sooner you guys can get out of
here and get back to doing your stuff.

11:09.955 --> 11:12.529
And, quite frankly, I need the bed.

11:13.125 --> 11:16.328
Perhaps if you told Dr. Carter
we were here?

11:19.548 --> 11:22.917
- Your fans are getting restless.
- What is it with you and nuns, Carter?

11:23.093 --> 11:24.373
It's almost kinky.

11:24.553 --> 11:26.961
- Can you take care of them for me?
- They're looking for you.

11:27.139 --> 11:28.550
My grandmother had a...

11:28.724 --> 11:31.476
She passed out this morning.
Having Cardiology work her up.

11:31.643 --> 11:34.514
- Is she okay?
- I don't know.

11:34.730 --> 11:36.058
- Are you?
- Me? I'm fine.

11:36.231 --> 11:38.805
- Just wanna see she gets settled.
- I'll take care of it.

11:38.984 --> 11:40.478
- Thank you.
- Come on, ladies.

11:40.652 --> 11:44.946
Tequila Willie is still in Exam 1, covered
in puke and assorted body fluids.

11:45.115 --> 11:47.950
- He's making this whole place reek.
- This place always reeks.

11:48.118 --> 11:51.238
- Yeah. And it's Abby's turn.
- Oh, come on.

11:51.412 --> 11:53.739
I did him last time. You're up.

11:53.916 --> 11:55.195
Fine.

11:55.375 --> 11:57.414
- Nicole.
- You need something?

11:57.586 --> 12:01.418
Yeah, grab some gloves. I'm gonna
show you how to bathe a patient.

12:03.133 --> 12:04.414
Robert!

12:04.593 --> 12:07.796
I was scrubbing in when
I discovered Dale's doing my Whipple.

12:07.971 --> 12:09.947
Yeah, he's an arrogant ass,
but he's becoming a decent surgeon.

12:10.024 --> 12:12.263
- I thought I was back on service today.
- No, not yet.

12:12.433 --> 12:15.601
Why not? I've complied with every
insulting, demeaning request.

12:15.770 --> 12:17.929
Even volunteered for a lie detector test.

12:18.023 --> 12:21.025
But we have to wait for the CDC
to finish with their bug hunt.

12:21.109 --> 12:23.481
But the criminal investigation
is essentially over.

12:23.653 --> 12:25.610
- Couldn't find anything.
- What's that mean?

12:25.780 --> 12:28.734
"We think you're killing your patients,
we just can't prove it?"

12:28.908 --> 12:33.571
- This has nothing to do with you.
- Then why am I not in surgery?

12:34.331 --> 12:38.245
I'm sorry. I know this is frustrating. But
what choice does either one of us have?

12:38.418 --> 12:40.690
Take the opportunity to catch up
with your dictation.

12:40.762 --> 12:43.038
Spend time with your baby.
Enjoy the downtime.

12:43.965 --> 12:45.709
- What are you doing?
- Excuse me?

12:45.884 --> 12:47.461
- That's my patient.
- Drawing blood.

12:47.635 --> 12:49.960
No, you were injecting something
into her central line.

12:50.138 --> 12:51.798
I couldn't get a draw.
It's clogged.

12:51.973 --> 12:53.966
- What did you inject into my patient?
- I didn't.

12:54.142 --> 12:56.632
- Don't lie to me! I saw you!
- Is there a problem here?

12:56.811 --> 12:58.969
- No, I was-
- Yes. She was injecting my patient.

12:59.147 --> 13:02.098
Urokinase to bust the clot in her line.

13:02.291 --> 13:03.771
Let me see it.

13:05.611 --> 13:07.521
Where's the vial?

13:08.782 --> 13:10.275
Elizabeth.

13:18.958 --> 13:20.239
Sorry.

13:20.418 --> 13:22.621
Excuse me.

13:24.363 --> 13:28.907
Twenty-six years with the Chicago P.D.
Never fired my gun once.

13:29.077 --> 13:30.904
That's good.

13:32.581 --> 13:34.871
These are different times.

13:37.879 --> 13:40.667
Try and stay off your ankle
and keep it elevated.

13:40.841 --> 13:44.257
- Dr. Kovac, Jeremy's mother's here.
- Okay.

13:45.305 --> 13:48.840
I'll have one of the nurses
give you a lesson on using the crutches.

13:55.608 --> 13:56.937
Mrs. Norris?

13:57.111 --> 14:01.025
Hi. I'm Dr. Kovac.
I was the first doctor to treat your son.

14:01.198 --> 14:03.986
- How is he?
- He suffered a hemothorax.

14:04.160 --> 14:07.612
That's when blood collects
in the chest cavity and collapses a lung.

14:07.790 --> 14:10.281
- But it's been repaired.
- Can I see him?

14:10.459 --> 14:13.627
- He's been taken up to the O.R.
- But he's gonna be okay.

14:13.796 --> 14:16.288
There was evidence of a head injury.

14:17.300 --> 14:18.581
Is he in a coma?

14:18.760 --> 14:22.462
I'm afraid we won't know until he's out
of surgery and the anesthesia wears off.

14:22.640 --> 14:25.048
There's the idiot who was chasing him,
right there.

14:25.226 --> 14:27.469
- Are you the boy's mother?
- What did you do?

14:27.646 --> 14:30.517
- Nothing. I'm sorry-
- He threw his stick at him.

14:30.691 --> 14:32.518
- What?
- You should get back in bed.

14:32.693 --> 14:34.983
No, he's the one
who made Jeremy wipe out.

14:35.155 --> 14:37.776
Your boy was riding in the mall.
I asked him to leave.

14:37.949 --> 14:40.275
- You knocked him off his skateboard!
- I didn't!

14:40.452 --> 14:41.698
- You attacked my son?
- No!

14:41.912 --> 14:43.870
- You did!
- Can you put him in the room?

14:44.082 --> 14:45.327
- What'd you do?
- Nothing!

14:45.500 --> 14:47.243
- I called the ambulance!
- Where is it?

14:47.419 --> 14:48.997
Last door on the right.

14:49.171 --> 14:51.045
- He hurt my son?
- I don't know, ma'am.

14:51.215 --> 14:54.501
He's the reason Jeremy's here.
He should be arrested or something!

14:54.678 --> 14:57.216
I just wanna see Jeremy.
I just wanna be with my son.

14:57.389 --> 15:00.426
I'll get an update and find out
when you can go to see him, okay?

15:00.601 --> 15:02.511
- I think he's having a heart attack!
- Good!

15:02.687 --> 15:05.723
He started hyperventilating
and complaining of chest pain.

15:07.860 --> 15:11.064
- What's going on, Mr. Hilliker?
- I don't feel so good.

15:11.239 --> 15:14.573
- Chest hurts?
- Yeah. Head is spinning.

15:14.743 --> 15:17.863
Okay, put him on oxygen, aspirin
and let's get an EKG.

15:18.038 --> 15:22.784
I didn't mean to upset the mother. I was
just trying to offer my condolences.

15:22.961 --> 15:24.241
Just relax.

15:25.589 --> 15:27.416
He rode by me. He stole my hat.

15:27.592 --> 15:32.468
He was tossing it back and forth,
threatening to throw it in the fountain.

15:32.639 --> 15:35.925
- They were terrorizing the mall.
- Did you throw your nightstick at him?

15:38.437 --> 15:40.762
Okay. Okay. Just relax.

15:46.989 --> 15:49.361
- Dr. Zogoiby.
- Dr. Corday.

15:49.534 --> 15:50.862
I've been reviewing charts...

15:51.035 --> 15:53.953
...and I have a question about a patient
you worked on with me.

15:54.123 --> 15:57.954
- Yes?
- It was a few weeks ago. A Mrs. Taylor?

15:58.127 --> 16:01.211
I'm having a little difficulty
reading your notes.

16:01.381 --> 16:04.086
- You put in a central line.
- No, I was called away.

16:04.259 --> 16:07.177
That was the day my son fell off
the monkey bars at school.

16:07.346 --> 16:09.671
The on-call anesthesiologist
stepped in for me.

16:09.848 --> 16:12.886
- And who was that?
- Babcock.

16:13.061 --> 16:15.683
- Babcock.
- Hope this wasn't a waste of time.

16:15.856 --> 16:18.526
- Think this kid'll ever wake up?
- I don't know.

16:18.693 --> 16:21.363
You're scaring me.
You're not your usual jolly self today.

16:21.529 --> 16:24.989
Haven't developed a drug addiction
or drinking problem like your buddies...

16:25.159 --> 16:26.653
- ... in the ER, have you?
- No.

16:26.827 --> 16:28.072
Give it time.

16:28.245 --> 16:30.488
- Jeremy's mother is in the waiting room.
- Great.

16:30.665 --> 16:32.623
Jacy, have you tracked down
my sister yet?

16:32.792 --> 16:34.869
- I left another message.
- All right. Thanks.

16:35.046 --> 16:37.371
- You want me to talk to her?
- No.

16:37.548 --> 16:39.043
Good.

16:45.224 --> 16:46.766
Mrs. Norris.

16:46.934 --> 16:50.434
Hi. I'm Dr. Benton. I'm one
of the surgeons that was with Jeremy.

16:50.605 --> 16:52.848
- How is he?
- We tied off the bleeding vessels...

16:53.025 --> 16:57.486
...in the chest, but there's swelling in
the brain. He's with a neuro team now.

16:58.198 --> 17:01.282
With an injury like this,
it becomes a...

17:01.451 --> 17:05.200
- A waiting game.
- Waiting? To see if he wakes up?

17:05.373 --> 17:07.945
Waiting to see if he's a vegetable?
What?

17:08.960 --> 17:10.454
All of that.

17:10.628 --> 17:13.202
They've got to be able
to do something.

17:13.382 --> 17:15.208
He's all I've got.

17:17.512 --> 17:18.839
Yeah.

17:19.012 --> 17:22.015
- Ever gotten an erythropoietic porphyria?
- No.

17:22.184 --> 17:25.553
- What about porphyria cutanea tarda?
- No.

17:25.729 --> 17:27.888
The most unusual medical case
you've ever seen?

17:28.066 --> 17:31.067
I had a guy with a live bullfrog
in his ass once.

17:31.570 --> 17:34.275
Ever seen a patient scratch through
the skin into the bone?

17:34.449 --> 17:37.698
- Are you serious?
- Figure he'll hit gray matter by spring.

17:37.869 --> 17:41.285
Mr. Eldon, could you show
a young med student your itch?

17:41.456 --> 17:42.915
- Save me.
- What?

17:43.084 --> 17:45.491
I have a med student who
is in need of a home.

17:45.670 --> 17:48.588
- No, thanks. But he seems nice.
- Oh, yeah. Of course he does.

17:48.756 --> 17:52.541
That's how they all start, till they
grow up to become Residents like Carter.

17:52.719 --> 17:54.000
I wish.

17:54.221 --> 17:55.550
- What?
- "I wish"?

17:55.723 --> 17:57.597
He turned into a good doctor.

17:57.767 --> 17:59.048
- He is.
- You and Carter...?

17:59.227 --> 18:04.055
Dr. Greene, can I ask you something?
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?

18:04.275 --> 18:05.520
Not at all.

18:05.693 --> 18:08.102
You don't mind me asking
all these questions, do you?

18:08.280 --> 18:11.281
Of course not. This is a
teaching hospital. This is how you learn.

18:11.450 --> 18:12.944
Bye.

18:15.037 --> 18:19.201
Oh, hi. I was just talking about you.
How's your grandmother? What is it?

18:20.377 --> 18:22.951
- Looks like Shy-Drager.
- I'm sorry.

18:23.631 --> 18:27.416
They've been having a lot of success
with fludrocortisone and desmopressin.

18:27.719 --> 18:29.758
- How'd she take it?
- I haven't told her yet.

18:29.930 --> 18:31.888
They're still running some tests.

18:32.058 --> 18:33.967
- Anything I can do?
- I don't think so.

18:34.143 --> 18:35.803
- Let me know.
- I will.

18:35.979 --> 18:39.763
Carter! Dr. John Carter, this is
your new med student, Michael...

18:39.942 --> 18:41.436
- Gallant.
- Hi.

18:41.610 --> 18:45.823
Go get the orientation package,
when you're finished just come find me.

18:45.990 --> 18:49.111
I did that while I was waiting.
I try to keep busy.

18:49.286 --> 18:52.371
- Yeah. I had a family emergency.
- Nothing serious, I hope.

18:52.540 --> 18:54.200
You wanna talk about it?

18:54.376 --> 18:58.326
Okay. Well, I watched a trauma already
and helped Dr. Kovac with a possible Ml.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.165
Both of which were very interesting.

19:00.341 --> 19:03.425
But I was hoping that once you got here
I could start working up...

19:03.595 --> 19:05.920
...some of my own cases.

19:06.097 --> 19:08.470
He stepped into the men's room.

19:08.683 --> 19:10.760
His grandmother's sick.

19:11.562 --> 19:14.267
Do you want to see if we can go
find you a case to work up?

19:14.440 --> 19:15.935
Yeah.

19:18.987 --> 19:20.482
Kit.

19:20.697 --> 19:25.159
I want to apologize for my behavior
earlier. It was completely unprofessional.

19:25.412 --> 19:28.746
I know it's not an excuse, but I have
been under a lot of stress lately.

19:28.916 --> 19:30.291
I understand.

19:30.459 --> 19:35.086
That said, I also have a couple
of questions about some recent cases.

19:35.256 --> 19:38.423
- Do you remember a Mr. Durning?
- Diverticulitis?

19:38.593 --> 19:42.633
No, he was an elderly gentleman, came
in for a hemicolectomy for colon cancer.

19:42.807 --> 19:45.096
- With all the faded Navy tattoos.
- Yes, yes.

19:45.268 --> 19:47.806
You took out his central line
on October the 16th.

19:47.980 --> 19:53.271
Yes. Well, no. It came out on the 16th.
But we didn't do it. Babcock did.

19:53.736 --> 19:55.231
Babcock?

19:55.530 --> 19:57.404
- Why Babcock?
- I don't know. He just did.

19:57.574 --> 20:01.952
Sometimes he likes to pull his own lines.
In fact, occasionally he insists on it.

20:03.414 --> 20:06.166
So Mrs. Reynolds,
how long have you had the spots?

20:06.334 --> 20:08.458
- About a week.
- I gave her some penicillin.

20:08.629 --> 20:10.622
- Oh, for what?
- I got a cold.

20:10.798 --> 20:13.254
Cough, sore throat, headaches.

20:14.010 --> 20:15.255
Antibiotics won't help.

20:15.428 --> 20:17.718
- I told you.
- Where'd you get the penicillin?

20:17.890 --> 20:20.464
The medicine cabinet.
Left over from an ear infection.

20:20.643 --> 20:23.051
Oh, yeah, you should never
share prescriptions.

20:23.229 --> 20:26.350
- If you're given one, try to use all of it.
- What's wrong?

20:26.525 --> 20:30.903
She's experiencing hypersensitivity
vasculitis. It's from the antibiotics.

20:31.072 --> 20:32.981
Thank you, Dr. Kevorkian.

20:33.157 --> 20:34.700
- Is it treatable?
- Absolutely.

20:34.868 --> 20:39.281
We'll get some medicine for you
and have you feeling as good as new.

20:44.254 --> 20:47.421
- You might wanna get a CBC.
- I beg your pardon?

20:47.591 --> 20:50.795
Her history. It could be indicative
of undiagnosed thrombocytopenia.

20:50.970 --> 20:53.640
- You know, low platelets.
- And you are...?

20:53.806 --> 20:56.298
Grace.
I'm a second-year med student.

20:56.769 --> 20:59.639
Ask if she has any unusual bleeding
when she brushes her teeth.

20:59.813 --> 21:02.139
- Are you a med student at this hospital?
- No.

21:02.316 --> 21:04.986
I'd appreciate it if you kept
your comments to yourself.

21:05.154 --> 21:06.398
Hello.

21:06.572 --> 21:08.565
- Is he your student?
- Excuse me?

21:08.741 --> 21:12.324
She's a second-year med student who
thinks she can diagnose my patients.

21:12.496 --> 21:14.322
He takes a lousy history.

21:14.498 --> 21:17.534
I will bet your lunch money
she's got thrombocytopenia.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.833
She's right. Low platelets.

21:20.004 --> 21:23.172
Needs additional labs,
head CT and admission.

21:23.508 --> 21:25.335
I'll take care of it.

21:26.136 --> 21:27.761
You're welcome.

21:27.972 --> 21:29.597
So do you do self-diagnosis too?

21:30.516 --> 21:33.602
As a matter of fact, I do.
I've let myself get a little rundown...

21:33.770 --> 21:37.021
...and I can feel the flu coming on.
I can't afford to be sick now.

21:37.191 --> 21:39.765
I was hoping you'd get me
a little Relenza or Tamiflu.

21:39.944 --> 21:41.901
We can manage that.
What school are you in?

21:42.071 --> 21:45.108
Western and Binville. I'm getting
my law degree simultaneously.

21:45.283 --> 21:46.529
Really?

21:46.702 --> 21:48.826
My parents didn't want me
to go to med school.

21:48.996 --> 21:50.906
I know that feeling.

21:52.250 --> 21:55.702
Excuse me. Can you get a head CT
for Mrs. Reynolds in Curtain 2?

21:55.879 --> 21:58.751
I'm not a nurse.
I'm just training. I'm sorry.

21:58.925 --> 22:01.416
That's okay.
I'm sort of in training myself.

22:01.595 --> 22:04.382
- I'm a new med student, Michael.
- Nicole.

22:04.556 --> 22:07.392
- How are you doing?
- Oh, okay.

22:07.560 --> 22:10.052
- Everybody helping you?
- Abby showed me how to bathe...

22:10.230 --> 22:11.688
- ... a homeless man. It was a little-

22:11.773 --> 22:14.347
Abby is pretty busy.
Stick with Malik and Haleh.

22:14.527 --> 22:16.852
- Is this Mr. Hilliker's 12-lead?
- Yeah.

22:17.029 --> 22:18.061
Did he have an MI?

22:18.156 --> 22:20.694
No. Probably just an anxiety attack.

22:20.867 --> 22:22.860
- Want to give him the good news?
- Can I?

22:23.036 --> 22:25.113
Yeah. I've got a trauma coming in.

22:25.289 --> 22:27.994
We're gonna need some IV saline.
It's in the suture room.

22:28.167 --> 22:29.412
Okay.

22:29.585 --> 22:32.871
- It can get a little crazy here.
- Yeah, I know. It's only my first day.

22:33.048 --> 22:35.088
- Are you liking it?
- So far, so good.

22:39.681 --> 22:42.884
- Oh, my God.
- Go! Go and get somebody!

22:44.937 --> 22:47.773
Take a breath, Mr. Hilliker.
Somebody help me!

22:57.451 --> 22:59.907
Somebody help me!

23:09.674 --> 23:12.292
Hang on. Hang on.

23:24.412 --> 23:26.654
Hey, Gam.
Sorry this is taking so long.

23:27.624 --> 23:30.328
- Did you get some lunch?
- No. I didn't get anything.

23:30.502 --> 23:32.993
That cardiologist has never
been back to see me.

23:33.171 --> 23:35.709
Yeah. It's because I asked
to speak to you first.

23:36.007 --> 23:37.418
Why?

23:38.970 --> 23:41.805
It's the least I can do,
since you've been stuck here all day.

23:41.973 --> 23:44.594
John, don't beat around the bush.

23:48.020 --> 23:50.428
You have what's called
Shy-Drager Syndrome.

23:50.607 --> 23:53.442
It's a progressive disease
that affects your blood pressure...

23:53.651 --> 23:57.021
...and could put you at a greater risk
for a heart attack or stroke.

23:58.532 --> 23:59.942
Is it gonna kill me?

24:01.577 --> 24:03.736
Most people die within 10 years.

24:06.582 --> 24:10.710
Ten years? I'm not even sure I want
to be around 10 more years.

24:10.879 --> 24:14.497
Ten days, now, that might
have put a kink in my plans.

24:14.674 --> 24:16.833
- Gam-
- Can I go home?

24:19.178 --> 24:24.055
- I think they want you to stay overnight.
- John, I want to go home.

24:51.630 --> 24:54.584
- You on a break?
- No.

24:56.385 --> 25:00.217
- Can I get you a coffee?
- No, thanks.

25:03.185 --> 25:05.261
Do you want to talk?

25:08.440 --> 25:10.350
Is he going to die?

25:11.360 --> 25:13.851
The guy that hung himself? No.

25:14.029 --> 25:18.739
Well, not today. He's lucky you
and that med student walked in.

25:22.121 --> 25:24.114
Try not to let it upset you too much.

25:24.290 --> 25:27.624
Once in a while some freak tries
to off himself in the hospital.

25:27.794 --> 25:29.787
I wish they would just do it at home.

25:33.508 --> 25:36.629
My father hung himself.
I was only 8.

25:36.804 --> 25:39.378
He'd lost another job.
I found him in the kitchen.

25:40.016 --> 25:42.341
I was too little to do anything.

25:42.977 --> 25:46.180
- Oh, God. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

25:49.442 --> 25:52.693
- Does Luka know this?
- No. I never told him.

25:52.863 --> 25:57.110
I never told anyone.
I don't think I can do this.

25:57.409 --> 26:01.822
- Well, it's not always this bad.
- Look at me. I'm crying like a baby.

26:03.582 --> 26:07.912
We've all cried. Sometimes
it's the only thing you can do.

26:10.339 --> 26:12.913
I went through my charts.
I found another commonality...

26:13.092 --> 26:15.215
...to all my post-op infection mortalities.

26:15.303 --> 26:16.335
What am I looking for?

26:16.513 --> 26:18.921
- I highlighted his name.
- Babcock?

26:19.099 --> 26:21.554
Yeah. He was in every case.
I only missed it before...

26:21.727 --> 26:25.227
...because he stepped in for Dr. Zogoiby,
whose handwriting is illegible.

26:25.398 --> 26:29.526
Dr. Babcock is gonna have a date with
your friend from the health department.

26:29.694 --> 26:32.185
- Phone call, Dr. Greene.
- Take a message.

26:32.364 --> 26:36.029
He knew I was being investigated. Why
didn't he step forward, say something?

26:36.201 --> 26:39.535
Maybe he didn't want to be probed
or forced to give stool samples.

26:39.704 --> 26:42.705
I'm being serious. Who knows
what he's working with in his lab.

26:42.874 --> 26:45.959
I'm sorry. That's Rachel's school.
They need you to pick her up.

26:46.128 --> 26:48.286
- Is she all right?
- She got suspended.

26:48.463 --> 26:51.251
- For what?
- I don't know. That's not my business.

26:51.426 --> 26:53.549
- Suspended?
- It must be some kind of mistake.

26:53.720 --> 26:57.504
- Probably drug-related.
- You better go. I'll deal with this.

26:59.935 --> 27:03.101
- How's he doing?
- Pulse ox is 98 on 50%.

27:03.271 --> 27:08.397
Good. Mr. Hilliker, we had to put a tube
down your throat to help you breathe.

27:08.569 --> 27:10.894
I'm gonna take it out now, okay?

27:11.071 --> 27:13.741
I want you to take some deep breaths.

27:14.283 --> 27:19.242
When I say blow, I want you to blow
as hard as you can. Ready? Okay, blow.

27:24.502 --> 27:26.081
I'm sorry.

27:26.254 --> 27:29.172
Try not to speak, Mr. Hilliker.
Take some deep breaths.

27:32.427 --> 27:35.001
- Tell him.
- Okay, Mr. Hilliker. Just relax.

27:35.222 --> 27:36.681
Just relax.

27:38.434 --> 27:42.432
He doesn't want us to tell the police.
He's still got buddies on the force.

27:42.605 --> 27:44.563
I'm afraid we have to.

27:50.948 --> 27:55.526
It's gonna be okay, Mr. Hilliker.
It's gonna be okay.

28:03.628 --> 28:06.083
- His wife died last year.
- What?

28:06.255 --> 28:08.295
Breast cancer.

28:11.970 --> 28:14.805
He was a respected
and decorated police officer.

28:14.973 --> 28:18.841
Only reason he took the job at the mall
was so that he could still help people.

28:19.019 --> 28:23.147
- Why are you telling me this?
- I just thought you should know.

28:29.655 --> 28:32.906
Keep an eye on his vitals
and call for a psych consult.

28:38.164 --> 28:40.621
-100.8.
- Feels like 108.

28:40.792 --> 28:45.336
BP is 140 over 80. And your white
count is 14,000. You're a little anemic.

28:45.506 --> 28:47.499
40% of menstruating women
are anemic.

28:47.675 --> 28:51.542
My diagnosis is you're a little rundown.
Maybe it's time to pick a career.

28:51.721 --> 28:53.346
Medicine beats law any day.

28:53.514 --> 28:56.468
My parents will only pay for med school
if I graduate law school.

28:56.642 --> 29:00.557
If your parents are both attorneys, why
don't you have any health insurance?

29:00.730 --> 29:05.476
I have a sad and complicated relationship
with them that you couldn't understand.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.695
I might surprise you.

29:07.863 --> 29:10.021
You need to take better care
of yourself, Grace.

29:10.199 --> 29:13.532
You need to eat right, get plenty
of sleep and lay off the caffeine-

29:13.703 --> 29:16.870
I would if I could. I haven't had
eight hours' sleep in months.

29:17.039 --> 29:19.198
Do you think you could
get me some Halcion?

29:19.709 --> 29:23.624
- I don't think so.
- Just one dose. I mean...

29:23.797 --> 29:27.581
Today is shot for me. If I could
just go home and crash. Please?

29:28.969 --> 29:31.175
I diagnosed your student's patient.

29:32.807 --> 29:35.344
This is a one-time special treatment...

29:35.517 --> 29:38.934
...and only if you promise to do
the other things we talked about.

29:40.064 --> 29:41.855
Cross my heart.

29:42.025 --> 29:44.397
What are the EKG findings
for hyperkalemia?

29:44.569 --> 29:46.942
Peaked T waves, prolonged PR
and short QT intervals.

29:47.114 --> 29:48.940
You're good.

29:50.408 --> 29:53.943
- Hey. Your day getting any better?
- Not yet.

29:54.121 --> 29:56.909
Did you talk to your grandmother?
How did she take it?

29:57.083 --> 29:58.957
It didn't bother her.
She went home.

29:59.127 --> 30:01.534
- You let her drive?
- No. Her driver picked her up.

30:01.712 --> 30:04.168
- You have to notify the DMV.
- I didn't tell her that.

30:04.340 --> 30:06.914
Dying's one thing.
Not driving is another story.

30:07.093 --> 30:10.177
- You have to mail in the notice.
- I didn't see her as an ER patient.

30:10.347 --> 30:11.806
- I brought her in.
- It's the law.

30:11.973 --> 30:15.343
- I can't rat out my own grandmother.
- You want me to? She doesn't like me.

30:15.519 --> 30:17.476
Carter!
Your patient went down.

30:19.565 --> 30:21.438
- What happened?
- She must have vagalled.

30:21.609 --> 30:23.187
All right. Let's get the gurney.

30:24.737 --> 30:26.113
Whoa...

30:27.407 --> 30:28.438
All right, come on.

30:28.616 --> 30:31.190
- I need to talk.
- Somebody took target practice...

30:31.369 --> 30:33.527
...on a crossing guard.
I gotta plug her up.

30:33.705 --> 30:36.410
- It's rather important.
- Well, give me the Cliff Notes.

30:38.210 --> 30:39.787
I'm listening.

30:42.840 --> 30:46.423
- I'd prefer to have your full attention.
- Suit yourself.

30:46.594 --> 30:48.385
Are you joining us, Elizabeth?

30:49.054 --> 30:50.964
No. I'm afraid not.

30:51.140 --> 30:55.803
If you could have your assistant
page me when you're done, please?

31:02.444 --> 31:05.481
- Hey. Thanks for coming.
- Want something to eat?

31:05.656 --> 31:07.898
No, no. So, what did he say?

31:08.075 --> 31:11.279
I talked to Mitch and Sophie, my friend
that works in the courthouse.

31:11.454 --> 31:12.485
And?

31:12.664 --> 31:15.154
They said the worst thing to do is fight.

31:15.332 --> 31:18.952
- I can fight it if I want to?
- It looks like you got something to hide.

31:19.129 --> 31:21.666
What if I'm just offended
by the whole principle?

31:21.840 --> 31:25.459
Peter, you go in. You get swabbed.

31:25.636 --> 31:29.681
They run the DNA. And you can prove
once and for all that Reece is your son.

31:31.558 --> 31:35.806
- What if he's not, Jackie?
- Is that really a possibility?

32:45.763 --> 32:48.967
- What are you doing?
- You're out of surgery.

32:49.308 --> 32:53.259
The patient coded before we even got
started. What are you doing down here?

32:56.524 --> 32:59.276
I wanted to ask you
about a couple of cases.

33:02.864 --> 33:08.738
You know, it doesn't matter anyway.
It'll have to wait. I've just been paged.

33:10.707 --> 33:12.285
Elizabeth.

33:13.501 --> 33:15.161
Aren't you forgetting something?

33:17.464 --> 33:19.041
I believe those are mine.

33:22.594 --> 33:24.172
Thank you.

33:26.807 --> 33:31.392
I must be dehydrated. All I've had
is coffee and a muffin since last night.

33:32.772 --> 33:34.515
You want to tell us about the scars?

33:37.235 --> 33:38.812
I used to be a cutter.

33:38.986 --> 33:42.771
My parents fought a lot when I was
a kid, and I was a geek in school.

33:43.825 --> 33:48.535
I developed an eating disorder.
It was my way of dealing with stress.

33:48.830 --> 33:50.658
Did you ever see anybody about it?

33:52.292 --> 33:55.294
The only people who seemed
to care were the doctors and nurses.

33:55.463 --> 33:59.212
- Probably why I'm in med school.
- What about now? Are you still cutting?

33:59.467 --> 34:01.175
No.

34:02.471 --> 34:05.388
- Show me your arm.
- You don't believe me?

34:11.855 --> 34:14.263
You have a fever and
a borderline white count.

34:14.442 --> 34:16.849
Maybe from an infection,
or using a dirty blade.

34:17.027 --> 34:20.355
- I told you I haven't eaten.
- So the eating disorder continues?

34:22.284 --> 34:25.783
- No. I've just been cramming.
- Pull up your skirt.

34:27.080 --> 34:29.951
- Pardon me? I don't think so.
- Let me see your thigh.

34:30.708 --> 34:32.500
- You ass!
- You're still cutting.

34:32.710 --> 34:35.002
- We just want to help you.
- Okay, hold on. Grace.

34:35.080 --> 34:37.539
- I have a pathology final.
- If you don't stay...

34:37.716 --> 34:39.259
...I'll put you on psych hold.

34:39.342 --> 34:41.359
- On what grounds?
- Danger to self.

34:41.494 --> 34:42.795
- That's not true.
- Grace, Grace, wait.

34:42.806 --> 34:44.050
Stop!

34:44.764 --> 34:47.339
You're blowing this
way out of proportion!

34:49.521 --> 34:52.391
- Why are you doing this?
- I know what it's like to need help...

34:52.565 --> 34:53.976
...when you least want it.

34:54.568 --> 34:57.141
- Please just leave me alone.
- I can't.

34:59.115 --> 35:02.531
What are you staring at? You couldn't
even diagnose thrombocytopenia.

35:02.702 --> 35:05.738
- Get five of droperidol.
- No! No, stop! Stop! I don't need that!

35:05.913 --> 35:08.748
- Okay. Get back into bed now.
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

35:08.917 --> 35:11.206
Please. Please. Please.

35:11.377 --> 35:13.619
- Take it easy. It's okay.
- You'll ruin everything.

35:13.796 --> 35:16.632
Please, you'll ruin everything.

35:17.008 --> 35:21.387
No, please, stop. Don't.
No, don't- Don't, please.

35:21.622 --> 35:23.812
Can't you just...?

35:34.249 --> 35:36.866
- I had to get a doctor to cover for me.
- I'm sorry.

35:37.002 --> 35:39.672
- Scissors, Rachel?
- It's not like they said.

35:39.838 --> 35:41.582
Did you threaten this girl?

35:41.757 --> 35:44.759
It was Natalie. I threatened
to cut her dreadlocks, not stab her.

35:44.928 --> 35:46.470
Why?

35:46.639 --> 35:50.721
She tried to steal Andrew away from me.
She keeps on sending notes in class...

35:50.893 --> 35:54.392
- ... and asking him over to study.
- This is over a boy.

35:54.565 --> 35:58.272
- It's no big deal, Dad.
- Then why aren't you in gym class now?

35:58.444 --> 36:01.018
Maybe because they stopped
teaching gym in the '70s.

36:01.197 --> 36:02.822
Don't get smart. This is serious.

36:02.990 --> 36:06.775
You've been suspended. Next time
you will be expelled permanently.

36:06.953 --> 36:08.234
There won't be a next time.

36:08.331 --> 36:10.738
Right. Because now we have
a new set of rules.

36:10.916 --> 36:12.957
- Like what?
- No more rides to school...

36:13.128 --> 36:14.871
...unless it's with Elizabeth or me.

36:14.964 --> 36:16.671
No more going out on weeknights...

36:16.840 --> 36:19.877
...or weekends for that matter,
for at least a month.

36:20.052 --> 36:22.509
- Why don't you send me to a convent?
- I would.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.172
But I need you around the house
to do all your chores.

36:25.350 --> 36:26.382
I have chores now?

36:26.602 --> 36:29.058
Yep. Think of yourself as Cinderella...

36:29.230 --> 36:32.185
- ... and I'm your evil stepmother.
- I've already got one of those.

36:32.359 --> 36:34.897
Keep it up. You'll find
yourself back in St. Louis.

36:35.488 --> 36:39.901
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Don't know. Maybe because I love you?

36:40.076 --> 36:41.736
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really.

36:41.911 --> 36:44.485
Do you know how many
messed-up teenagers I see?

36:44.665 --> 36:48.616
Drug addicts, suicides, 10-year-old
homeless girls who've been raped...

36:48.795 --> 36:52.164
...because nobody gave a damn about
them? Well, I give a damn about you.

36:52.340 --> 36:55.924
You may not like it now.
Hell, you may never like it.

36:56.095 --> 36:58.337
This is how it's gonna be.

36:59.224 --> 37:00.932
Get in.

37:10.153 --> 37:14.198
- Need any help?
- Hey. Did you page me?

37:14.366 --> 37:19.029
No, but I figured I might find you in here.
Hi, Reece. How are you?

37:20.540 --> 37:21.951
Good.

37:22.334 --> 37:24.411
Did you talk to Jackie?

37:25.046 --> 37:27.003
Yeah.
She thinks I should take the test.

37:31.553 --> 37:36.300
So, what happens
if you're not a genetic match?

37:38.311 --> 37:41.645
Well, I guess it makes it easier
for Roger to fight me for custody.

37:43.317 --> 37:45.309
Nothing's changed, Peter.

37:45.820 --> 37:47.813
You're still his father.

37:49.574 --> 37:52.991
So what are you two
doing for dinner?

37:53.161 --> 37:54.787
Why don't you come to my place?

37:54.956 --> 37:57.743
I have those fish sticks in the freezer
Reece likes.

37:59.168 --> 38:01.376
Hey, hey! Take it easy.

38:01.547 --> 38:05.379
- Someone's getting a little frustrated.
- He's tired. He wants to go home.

38:07.803 --> 38:12.182
Daddy can't take you home.
I have to work.

38:15.020 --> 38:16.895
What's he saying?

38:19.151 --> 38:22.022
He wants his other daddy
to come take him home.

38:22.196 --> 38:26.693
Gamma, because you cannot drive.
Because you could black out.

38:27.169 --> 38:33.022
No, I'm- Hey, I'm sorry.
No, I'm not. No, I am not.

38:36.546 --> 38:39.002
- She won't stop driving?
- She's calling from the car.

38:39.174 --> 38:42.128
She's been driving around
for two hours just to prove me wrong.

38:42.636 --> 38:46.256
It's not funny. She could hurt
herself or somebody else.

38:47.392 --> 38:49.634
- What are you gonna do?
- What am I gonna do?

38:49.811 --> 38:52.220
What am I gonna do?
Call the cops on my grandmother?

38:52.398 --> 38:56.063
- You already made me call the DMV.
- Me? Don't make me the bad guy.

38:56.987 --> 39:00.570
- I should go home, wait for her.
- I can wait with you.

39:01.575 --> 39:04.149
- Yeah?
- I mean, yeah, if you want.

39:08.500 --> 39:09.875
Enter!

39:10.544 --> 39:13.213
I was just about to page you.
Have a seat.

39:20.180 --> 39:22.257
So, Elizabeth.

39:22.433 --> 39:25.102
Dr. Babcock says that you
were trespassing in his office...

39:25.270 --> 39:27.595
...and his research area.
Care to elaborate?

39:28.899 --> 39:32.518
- I wanted to talk to him.
- You knew I was in surgery.

39:37.159 --> 39:41.945
He's worked on every one of my cases
that died from a post-operative infection.

39:42.832 --> 39:45.750
- Is this true?
- Yes. It's true.

39:45.919 --> 39:48.493
- And I have evidence to prove it.
- So what?

39:49.464 --> 39:52.170
You have made it clear
on more than one occasion...

39:52.343 --> 39:54.383
...you are not opposed to euthanasia.

39:54.471 --> 39:56.464
I can't imagine a humane doctor who is.

39:56.640 --> 39:59.807
- I have four bodies in the morgue!
- That's not my fault.

39:59.977 --> 40:02.812
You need to take responsibility
for your gross misjudgment!

40:02.981 --> 40:05.021
- Time out!
- This is a load of crap.

40:05.567 --> 40:09.526
You allow her to operate on elderly lost
souls who should never be in surgery.

40:09.697 --> 40:12.104
And then when they die,
which they inevitably will...

40:12.283 --> 40:14.241
...she comes looking
for someone to blame!

40:14.411 --> 40:17.411
They didn't die from surgery.
They died from post-op infection.

40:17.581 --> 40:19.621
- The key word there being "post-op. "
- Okay.

40:19.792 --> 40:22.118
If you hadn't operated, they'd be alive.

40:22.212 --> 40:23.242
Okay! Enough!

40:23.379 --> 40:25.668
This whole thing
has gotten out of hand.

40:27.551 --> 40:30.221
The health department has
yet to conclude its investigation.

40:30.387 --> 40:33.175
Until they do,
neither one of you is in the O.R. Happy?

40:33.350 --> 40:34.892
- No.
- That's not a solution.

40:35.184 --> 40:36.810
It works for me.

40:37.062 --> 40:39.849
- I'm not doing another case with her.
- You certainly aren't.

40:40.232 --> 40:43.186
Get out, both of you.
You're giving me a headache. Go.

40:44.529 --> 40:46.024
God is love.

40:47.574 --> 40:49.567
You can go home, Gallant.
Carter signed out.

40:49.743 --> 40:53.528
Oh, yeah, I know.
I think I'm gonna stay and study.

40:53.706 --> 40:54.994
Here?

40:55.429 --> 40:57.876
Maybe I'll pick up stuff by osmosis.

40:58.045 --> 40:59.705
You'll pick up something.

41:04.218 --> 41:07.006
Hi. Feeling better?

41:07.932 --> 41:09.556
What do you want?

41:09.892 --> 41:11.968
I heard you talking
about your pathology exam.

41:12.144 --> 41:14.517
I thought you might like
to take a look at Robbins.

41:18.819 --> 41:20.231
Thanks.

41:22.740 --> 41:25.576
I'm sorry about some
of the crap I said to you.

41:25.827 --> 41:29.494
- I think I was just a little stressed.
- I know what that's like.

41:29.999 --> 41:33.203
So you obviously know
your vasculitidies.

41:34.129 --> 41:37.332
How are you with your
glycogen-storage diseases?

41:39.594 --> 41:43.342
- Not so good.
- Yeah. Me neither.

41:47.561 --> 41:53.102
Mr. Benton? I am Asha.
You're here for a DNA test?

41:53.277 --> 41:54.688
Yeah.

41:57.114 --> 42:00.650
Okay. Don't worry, it's painless.

42:00.827 --> 42:03.994
I'm just gonna use this swab
to wipe the inside of your cheek. Okay?

42:04.164 --> 42:06.490
- Yeah.
- Say "ah. "

42:11.298 --> 42:13.041
Okay, all done.

42:13.967 --> 42:15.842
That wasn't so bad, now, was it?

42:21.392 --> 42:24.762
- I can't believe it.
- I didn't believe it either.

42:27.692 --> 42:29.269
Fentanyl.

42:29.443 --> 42:32.315
If you're gonna abuse drugs,
abuse a good one.

42:32.489 --> 42:36.154
- Wow.
- I've been clean and sober for a year.

42:37.078 --> 42:39.284
You got it out of your system.

42:40.248 --> 42:42.241
I wouldn't say that.

42:46.380 --> 42:47.756
What?

42:48.258 --> 42:49.538
Nothing.

42:50.844 --> 42:55.174
- Disappointed in me?
- No! No. I'm just...

42:57.351 --> 42:59.260
You were stabbed.

43:00.105 --> 43:02.892
Twice. I don't recommend it.

43:06.904 --> 43:09.360
- Can I see your scar?
- What?

43:09.532 --> 43:11.027
- Show me your scar.
- No.

43:11.200 --> 43:14.618
- Why not? Don't be bashful.
- Why? Get your own.

43:18.376 --> 43:21.876
Why do I feel like a school kid
sitting out here?

43:25.218 --> 43:27.625
Must be
the adolescent sexual tension.

43:30.223 --> 43:31.932
That's it.

43:35.396 --> 43:37.887
You know,
I used to have a crush on you.

43:39.109 --> 43:42.443
- Used to?
- It's all coming back to me now.

43:43.781 --> 43:46.272
- I used to have a crush on you too.
- Liar.

43:46.534 --> 43:49.738
I did! You were cute.

43:50.414 --> 43:52.121
- Real cute. But-
- But?

43:52.291 --> 43:55.494
Well, you were a med student,
I was a Resident...

43:55.670 --> 43:57.496
I'm a Resident now.

43:58.798 --> 44:01.087
- Chief Resident.
- That's right.

44:08.601 --> 44:10.891
Glad you came back.

44:12.397 --> 44:13.940
Me too.

44:19.656 --> 44:21.445
Gamma's home.
