11:52.680 --> 11:56.120
Like I said, come to me
when you're sticking to protocol.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.480
Can you believe Adam Groff threw poo
out of the coach window?

12:00.560 --> 12:02.360
I always knew he was deranged.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.760
[gasps] Oh my God, Mark!

12:08.840 --> 12:10.640
[chuckles] You scared me.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.080
Why are we in the paper again?

12:13.160 --> 12:15.880
And why have I been
fielding complaints from parents

12:15.960 --> 12:17.760
telling me their children
went on a school trip

12:17.840 --> 12:20.680
which involved missing students
and human feces?

12:21.600 --> 12:23.120
-I'll look into it.
-Hm.

12:24.200 --> 12:27.920
I told our investors
and the rest of the school board

12:28.000 --> 12:31.080
that you were going to turn
the narrative around.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.160
Yes.

12:32.240 --> 12:35.240
And our upcoming open day
will nip this in the bud.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.400
We'll be announcing
the rebrand to the press--

12:37.480 --> 12:39.000
[Mark] A rebrand isn't enough.

12:39.640 --> 12:42.680
You need to show them
that this place has changed.

12:42.760 --> 12:46.720
If we don't get the next round of money,
we are screwed. Do you understand?

12:47.320 --> 12:50.640
Yes. I will not let you down.

12:50.720 --> 12:53.680
Good. I've got a meeting to get to.

12:53.760 --> 12:54.880
Of course.

12:56.280 --> 12:57.440
Of course you do.

12:57.960 --> 12:58.880
Thank you.

12:59.400 --> 13:02.480
Thank you so much
for that encouraging pep talk.

13:03.480 --> 13:04.680
So supportive.

13:04.760 --> 13:06.880
[whimsical music playing]

13:06.960 --> 13:09.960
-Gentle. Fucking fucklord--
-Hi, Hope.

13:10.480 --> 13:11.960
-Hi.
-Sorry, I can come back--

13:12.040 --> 13:15.320
No, absolutely not.
Um, how can I help you?

13:16.800 --> 13:20.040
Um, okay, so I got onto the GTIP.

13:20.120 --> 13:21.560
-Oh. Well done.
-Um…

13:21.640 --> 13:24.880
So I was wondering if you'd managed
to get that funding we talked about.

13:25.840 --> 13:28.320
-I spoke to the school board.
-Mm-hmm.

13:28.400 --> 13:33.320
And unfortunately,
things are a bit tight at the moment.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.360
And so, they said no.

13:36.440 --> 13:37.520
[inhales deeply]

13:38.240 --> 13:39.200
Yeah.

13:39.280 --> 13:40.600
I'm so sorry, Maeve.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.200
No, it's fine.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.640
Hopefully, your family can find the money.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.240
Yeah, yeah.

13:49.320 --> 13:50.480
-[sighs]
-Okay.

13:53.360 --> 13:54.240
[door closes]

13:54.320 --> 13:56.320
[emotional music playing]

14:06.200 --> 14:08.200
[whimsical music playing]

14:24.120 --> 14:26.080
-[Aimee] Enjoy!
-[girl] Thank you.

14:26.160 --> 14:27.320
Free vulva cupcake?

14:27.400 --> 14:28.760
Ew, they're so ugly.

14:28.840 --> 14:33.120
I thought so, too, at first,
but every vulva is unique and beautiful

14:33.200 --> 14:35.000
and deserves to be cherished.

14:35.080 --> 14:36.000
Cherish it.

14:39.560 --> 14:41.240
[mouth full] Mm, this is so good.

14:43.760 --> 14:45.400
Why don't you just speak to her?

14:45.920 --> 14:47.600
'Cause I'm still pissed off.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.880
-Hey.
-Hi.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.480
-How are you?
-Good.

14:57.280 --> 14:59.360
I just got into
the Gifted & Talented Program.

14:59.880 --> 15:02.160
That's amazing! Oh, congrats, Maeve.

15:02.240 --> 15:06.120
Thanks. Don't think I have
the money to go, but, you know…

15:09.320 --> 15:10.200
So,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.280
I can tell you are ignoring my texts,

15:14.360 --> 15:17.680
which, under the circumstances,
is quite a point of vulnerability.

15:17.760 --> 15:19.960
Yeah. I'm sorry.

15:21.400 --> 15:22.280
Mm…

15:23.320 --> 15:27.880
It's just… I just wasn't expecting
what happened between us to happen.

15:29.480 --> 15:30.560
-Yeah.
-And, um…

15:32.520 --> 15:33.760
I like Isaac.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.400
You know, I think we have something good.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.000
So, uh…

15:46.280 --> 15:48.160
What, we should just forget about it?

15:51.920 --> 15:53.040
I think so.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.440
[announcement chime]

15:54.520 --> 15:57.200
[over PA] All students
to the assembly hall, please.

16:03.760 --> 16:07.480
[indistinct chatter]

16:11.000 --> 16:12.240
[phone chimes]

16:16.520 --> 16:18.840
[suspenseful music playing]

16:22.560 --> 16:24.040
[microphone feedback]

16:24.960 --> 16:26.400
I've asked you all here

16:27.080 --> 16:29.920
to announce
a new direction for your school.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.080
A fresh start.

16:33.840 --> 16:38.040
Moordale Secondary
will soon be known as Sparkside Academy.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.880
[students chattering]

16:40.480 --> 16:42.920
[Hope] I'm sure
you will have many questions,

16:43.000 --> 16:45.840
but our goals for Sparkside
will be made clear

16:45.920 --> 16:48.280
at our upcoming open day.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.720
We will also be inviting the press

16:53.800 --> 16:56.920
to show them
that "Sex School" is a thing of the past.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.520
And speaking of press,

16:59.600 --> 17:01.600
I'm sure you're all aware

17:01.680 --> 17:05.080
that our school
once again made the news today.

17:05.680 --> 17:07.240
Take me now, Lord Vanon!

17:07.320 --> 17:08.760
[students laughing]

17:08.840 --> 17:11.920
Yes, it was very funny, wasn't it?

17:12.960 --> 17:17.120
However, the part where they called us
an "institution full of sexual deviants"

17:18.040 --> 17:19.240
was not very funny at all.

17:20.680 --> 17:23.560
It seems that there are some students here

17:23.640 --> 17:28.080
who get a kick
out of giving us a bad name.

17:28.160 --> 17:30.160
And it has to stop.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.680
So, Lily Iglehart, Cal Bowman,

17:34.760 --> 17:37.800
and Adam Groff, come to the stage, please.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
[students whispering]

17:56.360 --> 17:58.880
[both mouthing]

17:59.600 --> 18:00.840
[Hope] Take a seat, please.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.280
From now on, punishment will be
dealt with differently on this campus.

18:10.160 --> 18:11.920
Will you read that out, please, Cal?

18:16.320 --> 18:18.120
"I am a slovenly troublemaker--"

18:18.200 --> 18:19.800
A little louder, please.

18:19.880 --> 18:20.800
[scoffs]

18:22.680 --> 18:25.480
"I am a slovenly troublemaker
who doesn't care about my peers!"

18:25.560 --> 18:28.080
-This is fucked up!
-Sit down, Jackson.

18:30.520 --> 18:31.840
Put the sign on, Cal.

18:35.720 --> 18:36.640
[tuts]

18:44.280 --> 18:46.480
I don't think my story was dirty.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.760
Then why is everyone laughing at you?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.600
[whispering]

18:58.320 --> 18:59.160
Read it.

18:59.240 --> 19:01.240
[somber music playing]

19:02.480 --> 19:03.400
"I wrote

19:04.200 --> 19:08.040
dirty and disgusting words
which have brought shame on my peers."

19:19.320 --> 19:22.000
Um, I can't read that word.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.960
It says that you are unhygienic.

19:26.480 --> 19:30.200
Because what you did in France
was filthy and put your peers at risk--

19:30.280 --> 19:31.160
Enough!

19:31.240 --> 19:32.200
Sit down.

19:32.280 --> 19:35.440
It's supposed to be school,
not somewhere we should be afraid.

19:35.520 --> 19:37.320
Okay, you're suspended.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.640
-What?
-[Hope] Leave.

19:38.720 --> 19:39.600
[students] What?

19:42.360 --> 19:43.680
I said, leave!

19:56.520 --> 20:02.280
"I am unhygienic
and put my peers at risk."

20:06.320 --> 20:09.040
You will not be allowed your phones
for the remainder of the week.

20:15.880 --> 20:18.400
No one is to speak to these students.

20:21.160 --> 20:24.360
And you will not be allowed
to remove your sign until I say so.

20:25.800 --> 20:26.800
[scoffs]

20:28.560 --> 20:30.680
You better shut your cake stall down.

20:32.280 --> 20:34.120
Okay. Back to class.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.040
[microphone thud, feedback]

20:38.200 --> 20:40.200
[somber music continues]

20:44.320 --> 20:46.640
[breathes deeply]

20:50.400 --> 20:52.600
-[Maeve] Hey.
-[phone ringing]

20:54.600 --> 20:56.800
-Hello, what's going on?
-[Isaac] The police are here.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.600
-They're looking for Elsie--
-[splutters] Slow down, Isaac. What?

20:59.680 --> 21:02.480
Your mum took Elsie for a walk
at her visitation. She didn't come back.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.400
-They think she's kidnapped her.
-What?

21:04.480 --> 21:05.840
They're heading to Anna's now.

21:05.920 --> 21:06.960
They wanna talk to you.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.120
Um, okay, I'll meet them there.

21:10.520 --> 21:11.480
You okay?

21:11.560 --> 21:12.400
No.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.800
Um, I need to go to Anna's.
There's an emergency.

21:14.880 --> 21:16.680
[tense music playing]

21:17.480 --> 21:19.160
-Do you wanna borrow my bike?
-[sobs] No.

21:19.240 --> 21:21.240
-It's quicker!
-I can't ride a bike, Otis.

21:21.320 --> 21:24.160
-What do you mean you can't--
-No one ever fucking taught me! Okay?

21:24.680 --> 21:25.560
Fuck!

21:28.800 --> 21:30.800
[indistinct chattering]

21:31.600 --> 21:33.160
When will you get married, Eric?

21:33.240 --> 21:35.240
He's 17, Mummy!

21:35.320 --> 21:39.440
I got married at 18. Young people
are getting married very old now.

21:40.080 --> 21:42.680
-It's foolish! Why wait?
-[laughing]

21:43.400 --> 21:45.720
Listen, Eric,
don't get married until you have to.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.840
Have fun while you can.

21:47.920 --> 21:48.800
Ow! Hey!

21:49.360 --> 21:52.280
Atinuke, I told you
you are not in this photo.

21:52.360 --> 21:54.560
-Uh-uh.
-What if you and Jimoh break up?

21:55.200 --> 21:57.160
-Out!
-[Beatrice laughs]

21:57.840 --> 21:59.760
[laughter]

21:59.840 --> 22:01.600
[whimsical music playing]

22:04.000 --> 22:05.920
-Have you got a girlfriend, Eric?
-He hasn't--

22:06.000 --> 22:08.560
Eric doesn't have time for girlfriends.

22:08.640 --> 22:10.920
He's too busy focusing on his school work.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.280
-Mm-hmm.
-[Beatrice] Yeah.

22:12.360 --> 22:14.000
-Don't wait too long.
-[chuckles]

22:14.080 --> 22:15.400
I'll pray every day

22:15.480 --> 22:19.360
that you meet a good Christian woman
and have a big wedding in Nigeria…

22:19.440 --> 22:20.280
[group] Yes!

22:20.360 --> 22:21.200
…before I die.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.320
[photographer] Okay.
Everybody, bunch together!

22:24.320 --> 22:26.720
Okay, on three, and then smile.

22:27.360 --> 22:30.200
One, two, three, smile!

22:30.280 --> 22:31.280
[camera shutter clicks]

22:32.440 --> 22:33.560
[tuts]

22:33.640 --> 22:34.880
Hey, you.

22:35.920 --> 22:38.520
You. Why are you not smiling?
You're ruining my picture.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.400
-[all clamoring]
-Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry!

22:41.520 --> 22:45.760
-[Eric] Sorry!
-Okay. One, two, three, smile.

22:46.600 --> 22:47.560
[camera shutter clicks]

22:48.520 --> 22:49.480
Just here.

22:54.280 --> 22:55.480
-[Maeve] Hi.
-[Isaac] Hi.

22:56.240 --> 22:58.880
-I wanted to make sure you're okay.
-[Maeve] Thank you.

22:59.960 --> 23:01.040
[Anna] You all right, Maeve?

23:01.120 --> 23:03.200
-What's he doing here?
-She needed a lift.

23:04.440 --> 23:05.400
That's convenient.

23:06.160 --> 23:08.680
Well, I'd better go inside and help,

23:08.760 --> 23:11.440
but thank you for dropping Maeve off.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.160
You know, I'm gonna come help too.

23:14.240 --> 23:15.680
[whimsical music playing]

23:20.680 --> 23:21.760
[clattering]

23:22.320 --> 23:24.120
[woman] Can you
tell me about this morning?

23:24.200 --> 23:25.440
[Anna] She seemed okay.

23:25.520 --> 23:28.840
-Her appeal for custody failed last month.
-[Otis whispers] There you go.

23:28.920 --> 23:31.920
She'd never been happy
about the supervised visits. Thank you.

23:33.080 --> 23:35.040
She didn't seem distracted?

23:35.120 --> 23:36.720
Yes, did she seem on edge at all?

23:36.800 --> 23:39.320
How about I ask the questions, boys? Hm?

23:40.440 --> 23:44.000
[clears throat]
So, how did Erin seem this morning?

23:44.080 --> 23:46.240
She wanted to take Elsie
to the playground.

23:46.320 --> 23:47.800
I had never imagined--

23:47.880 --> 23:49.480
Will my mum be in any trouble?

23:49.560 --> 23:52.960
This is serious. She could face
prison time when we find her.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.720
It's gonna be all right.

23:54.800 --> 23:58.400
[woman] She used a cashpoint
on Barrow Street at 10:17 a.m.,

23:58.480 --> 24:01.760
but that doesn't give us any indication
as to her whereabouts now.

24:02.360 --> 24:06.000
She's probably left Moordale.
Have you checked CCTV at the station?

24:06.640 --> 24:07.960
Yeah, we have.

24:08.040 --> 24:10.600
-And what about buses?
-[woman] We thought about buses too.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.000
And you can tap her phone.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.720
Sorry, how are you both connected
to the case again?

24:14.800 --> 24:18.280
I'm Maeve's friend.
He is her complicated love interest.

24:18.360 --> 24:22.160
You used to be her friend
until you were an arsehole at that party.

24:22.240 --> 24:25.560
The only arsehole is the man who deleted
my voice mail without telling her!

24:25.640 --> 24:27.120
Outside, both of you.

24:29.160 --> 24:31.720
-Outside. Yep.
-Okay.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.080
[Isaac] Always popping up
where people don't want you.

24:35.160 --> 24:37.000
-Just go home, man!
-You… you don't know me.

24:37.080 --> 24:39.400
-Always making things worse.
-What are you even doing--

24:39.480 --> 24:42.680
Shut up! The pair of you!
My sister is missing.

24:42.760 --> 24:45.120
This is not an opportunity for you
to swing your dicks around!

24:45.200 --> 24:47.440
Dunno how you can even think
of choosing this guy over me.

24:47.520 --> 24:50.600
Choosing? What are you talking about?
You're so deluded!

24:57.480 --> 24:58.360
[Isaac] Oh right.

24:59.640 --> 25:02.240
Did something happen
between you guys on the trip, then?

25:04.760 --> 25:05.680
Yeah, yeah.

25:07.360 --> 25:08.760
But it doesn't mean anything.

25:09.280 --> 25:11.760
I mean… I do… I don't know what it means.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.280
Elsie's missing.
That's all I care about right now.

25:16.160 --> 25:17.720
Well, good luck finding her, Maeve. Um…

25:18.320 --> 25:19.520
Isaac, don't go.

25:21.840 --> 25:23.000
[Maeve] Oh fuck.

25:23.080 --> 25:25.960
-Thanks, Otis.
-I think I should stay and help.

25:26.040 --> 25:27.200
No, I don't think you should.

25:27.280 --> 25:29.400
-You'd make things worse!
-What do you mean?

25:29.480 --> 25:32.440
Since you stopped the clinic, you stopped
caring about anyone but yourself.

25:32.520 --> 25:34.000
No, that's not true.

25:34.080 --> 25:36.880
It… it's just not my responsibility.

25:36.960 --> 25:38.440
I think you should go.

25:38.520 --> 25:40.360
I don't wanna see you anymore.

25:40.440 --> 25:41.480
Maeve.

25:43.640 --> 25:44.520
[door closes]

25:48.520 --> 25:49.480
[Jean] Jakob!

25:50.720 --> 25:51.760
Jakob!

25:54.200 --> 25:56.920
I think we need to work out
what we're going to tell the kids

25:57.000 --> 25:59.200
about why we're sleeping in separate beds.

25:59.960 --> 26:03.000
I don't think they need to know.
It's private between you and me.

26:03.080 --> 26:04.400
[Jean] Well, I disagree.

26:04.480 --> 26:07.360
Open dialogue is important with teenagers.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.520
Okay, you go ahead and tell them.

26:13.480 --> 26:15.200
[distant clattering]

26:16.920 --> 26:18.200
[clattering]

26:29.120 --> 26:31.480
I was just dropping off your book.

26:32.680 --> 26:34.560
[Jakob continues hammering]

26:34.640 --> 26:36.920
[whimsical music playing]

26:40.840 --> 26:42.600
Would you like to come in for a chat?

26:45.520 --> 26:47.520
[Jakob continues hammering]

26:49.000 --> 26:50.280
Have a seat. [sighs]

26:58.200 --> 26:59.040
So,

27:00.600 --> 27:03.360
why did you decide to return my notebook?

27:05.240 --> 27:06.680
I thought you should have it.

27:09.320 --> 27:13.080
So I assume it was also you
who made the photocopies last term.

27:13.840 --> 27:14.720
Yes, it was.

27:15.240 --> 27:16.720
[exhales]

27:17.440 --> 27:19.040
And I'm ashamed of my behavior.

27:28.880 --> 27:29.880
Um…

27:31.320 --> 27:34.200
I keep reading the things
Maureen said about me to you.

27:37.040 --> 27:38.360
And I think they're all true.

27:38.440 --> 27:40.360
[emotional music playing]

27:42.440 --> 27:44.000
But I don't know how to change.

27:48.600 --> 27:51.880
Come and voice your opinion
at the Student Forum tonight. Thank you.

27:51.960 --> 27:53.880
Viv, listen, I've had an idea.

27:53.960 --> 27:57.680
Let's use the forum to ask people
how they feel about Hope's new values.

27:57.760 --> 28:00.800
If enough people don't like
what she's doing, we can change things.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.680
-I can't do that.
-I don't get it.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.880
Why are you trying to help her?
She's bad news, Viv!

28:05.960 --> 28:09.320
Jackson, I'm not an idiot, okay?
I need to get into a good university.

28:09.400 --> 28:12.120
It's not just my dream.
It's important to my whole family.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.280
And I do not have the privilege
to fuck up school.

28:14.360 --> 28:18.120
Viv, I know you're not an idiot.
You're the smartest person I know.

28:18.200 --> 28:21.040
You're kidding yourself
if you think she cares about your dreams.

28:21.120 --> 28:23.840
[announcement over PA] Vivienne Odusanya
to Hope's office, please.

28:26.320 --> 28:27.280
Think about it.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.160
[door closes]

28:35.800 --> 28:38.800
I asked you to keep an eye on your peers
during this trip.

28:39.560 --> 28:42.040
And then I hear rumors,
and I'm left feeling confused

28:42.120 --> 28:46.920
because when I asked you
how the trip was going, you said,

28:47.000 --> 28:47.880
"Great!"

28:48.600 --> 28:50.320
So help me out here, Viv.

28:51.440 --> 28:53.560
I didn't wanna get anyone into trouble. I…

28:54.560 --> 28:56.720
-I felt in the middle.
-Right.

28:57.720 --> 28:58.760
[inhales]

28:58.840 --> 29:00.280
When I first met you,

29:00.880 --> 29:01.880
I thought,

29:02.600 --> 29:04.160
"This girl's going somewhere."

29:04.240 --> 29:07.840
You know, "She's driven. She's focused."

29:08.600 --> 29:10.240
But I don't know
how far you're going to go

29:10.320 --> 29:12.080
if you can't
keep your head above the parapet.

29:12.160 --> 29:14.320
I'm sorry. I… I should have been honest.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.280
Don't apologize to me.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.320
Apologize to yourself.

29:18.400 --> 29:20.760
I would hate
to see you lose out on opportunities

29:20.840 --> 29:22.440
because of a need to play nice.

29:23.040 --> 29:26.160
It's a very female trait,
and it holds us back.

29:26.240 --> 29:27.760
It will not happen again.

29:27.840 --> 29:28.840
It better not.

29:31.760 --> 29:34.520
Oh, one more thing, Vivienne.

29:38.480 --> 29:40.640
I want you to make
a presentation to the press

29:40.720 --> 29:43.440
and prospective students
on our upcoming open day.

29:43.520 --> 29:44.640
Even after this?

29:44.720 --> 29:47.240
Yes. You're our head girl.

29:47.320 --> 29:51.160
And having a strong, smart,
young woman of color leading the way

29:51.240 --> 29:53.440
shows how progressive we are as a school.

29:55.640 --> 29:57.280
So it's about how it looks.

29:58.520 --> 29:59.720
Of course it is.

30:01.560 --> 30:05.480
Here's the video
and the slides for you to prepare with.

30:20.160 --> 30:22.480
Uh, will you be
coming to the Student Forum?

30:23.000 --> 30:26.280
Perhaps there'll be some interesting ideas
I can add to the presentation?

30:26.920 --> 30:30.320
Why would I want to come and listen
to a bunch of teenagers whinging on

30:30.400 --> 30:33.640
about their insignificant problems
for an hour? No, thank you.

30:33.720 --> 30:36.560
[sighs] I've had quite enough
of this navel-gazing,

30:36.640 --> 30:38.800
identity-obsessed hysteria for one day.

30:39.520 --> 30:42.760
The quicker you and your fragile,
petty little peers realize

30:42.840 --> 30:44.320
that you're not that special

30:44.400 --> 30:49.240
and that the real world doesn't care
about your supposed issues, the better.

31:07.800 --> 31:10.320
I'd like to ask you
about your childhood, Michael.

31:12.320 --> 31:13.640
Can you tell me about your mother?

31:15.480 --> 31:16.640
She was quiet.

31:18.120 --> 31:19.120
And gentle.

31:21.360 --> 31:22.560
And she loved to cook.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.760
And she always smelled rather lovely…

31:28.760 --> 31:29.800
of shampoo.

31:34.440 --> 31:36.720
[sentimental music playing]

32:03.200 --> 32:04.240
And your father?

32:05.240 --> 32:06.400
Dad. Well, he…

32:08.640 --> 32:10.400
he was just different from my mum.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.160
[laughing]

32:19.200 --> 32:22.160
-Terrible, Dad, terrible.
-You're supposed to stop it.

32:23.280 --> 32:25.120
I think Michaela's crying, Dad!

32:25.200 --> 32:26.480
What?

32:27.000 --> 32:28.200
Why are you crying?

32:28.800 --> 32:30.440
Stop it! You're a boy!

32:31.480 --> 32:34.000
Boys don't cry.

32:38.600 --> 32:39.520
Hm.

32:40.560 --> 32:42.560
When was the last time you cried?

32:44.080 --> 32:45.880
Can't remember. [sniffles]

32:46.520 --> 32:48.360
Not even after your separation?

32:54.840 --> 32:56.680
And what do you do
that brings you pleasure?

32:58.120 --> 32:59.400
Are you suggesting I…

33:00.720 --> 33:01.640
masturbate?

33:02.360 --> 33:03.280
No.

33:05.120 --> 33:08.640
Believe it or not, Michael, I don't think
everything comes back to sex.

33:08.720 --> 33:09.720
[chuckles]

33:11.080 --> 33:12.640
What I'm asking is,

33:14.360 --> 33:17.400
what do you do that makes you feel joy?

33:21.400 --> 33:23.000
I don't think I feel that emotion.

33:23.520 --> 33:25.400
[emotional music playing]

33:25.480 --> 33:30.080
Very often, Michael,
when children are bullied by a parent,

33:30.720 --> 33:35.000
they falsely learn
that emotions are a sign of vulnerability,

33:35.080 --> 33:36.640
and so they shut them off.

33:38.480 --> 33:40.160
What I'd like you to do

33:41.480 --> 33:43.080
is to find something

33:44.240 --> 33:45.480
that makes you happy.

33:48.680 --> 33:49.640
[door opens]

33:51.800 --> 33:54.040
Um, thank you.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.960
And I'm sorry I said that thing about…

33:59.040 --> 33:59.960
masturbation.

34:01.080 --> 34:02.520
That's really okay.

34:03.720 --> 34:06.400
However, in your case, Michael,

34:07.080 --> 34:09.600
masturbation might not be such a bad idea.

34:15.880 --> 34:16.720
[Jean] You okay?

34:19.160 --> 34:20.040
What happened?

34:20.840 --> 34:24.480
Oh, well,
I just messed everything up. Again.

34:25.040 --> 34:27.920
'Cause I am clearly incapable

34:28.000 --> 34:30.280
of forming healthy relationships
with anyone.

34:31.720 --> 34:32.800
[Otis sighs]

34:32.880 --> 34:34.640
Is this about Maeve?

34:38.320 --> 34:40.200
I've never told you about Maeve.

34:40.280 --> 34:42.280
[mischievous music playing]

34:43.480 --> 34:47.000
Aimee mentioned,
just briefly, in her session with me

34:47.080 --> 34:50.600
that you'd had a romantic tension
with someone called Maeve,

34:50.680 --> 34:53.840
and something happened
at the party that you had here,

34:53.920 --> 34:55.760
and you fell out over something you said.

34:55.840 --> 34:57.280
Do you want to talk about it?

34:57.800 --> 34:59.880
No, I don't want to talk about it.

35:00.560 --> 35:05.920
Jealousy can make us act out of character
and say things we don't mean.

35:06.640 --> 35:09.720
-Was there another boy on the scene?
-You're doing it!

35:09.800 --> 35:10.720
Again!

35:11.640 --> 35:15.640
I can't believe you had the audacity
to tell me to stop giving out advice

35:15.720 --> 35:17.640
because I was being unethical.

35:17.720 --> 35:20.040
You are the most unethical woman
in the world!

35:20.120 --> 35:22.720
-Why won't you let me help you, Otis?
-Help me?

35:23.360 --> 35:25.440
How could you possibly help me?

35:25.520 --> 35:28.160
You push every man
you come into contact with away.

35:28.840 --> 35:32.560
-You literally suck at relationships.
-Where is this coming from, Otis?

35:33.760 --> 35:38.080
You brought Jakob into my life.
You make me live with Ola like a sister.

35:38.160 --> 35:41.800
And I like having them around.
It feels normal, for once.

35:43.200 --> 35:44.200
But that's over,

35:45.120 --> 35:46.160
isn't it?

35:50.040 --> 35:51.440
Yeah, that's what I thought.

35:51.520 --> 35:53.960
[emotional music playing]

35:56.760 --> 35:57.760
Shit.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.240
-[Anna] Thank you.
-[Maeve] My pleasure.

36:02.200 --> 36:04.840
This is my fault.
I should've told you what my mum is like.

36:04.920 --> 36:07.000
Maeve, this is not your fault.

36:07.080 --> 36:09.880
You're 17. You shouldn't have
to deal with stuff like this anyway.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.160
It's too much.

-Auntie Beryl!

[laughs] It's good!
It's good, you know. I think?

-Ah. You will go to more.

when Beatrice didn't marry him.

37:19.720 --> 37:21.440
-Why?
-[Beryl] Hm.

37:21.520 --> 37:22.720
His family is good.

37:23.400 --> 37:24.720
Very wealthy!

37:25.240 --> 37:28.120
Ah! He would have
given your mother the world.

37:28.200 --> 37:30.000
Uh, and what about my dad?

37:30.080 --> 37:32.400
-Your father? [chuckles]
-Uh-huh.

37:32.480 --> 37:36.520
[tuts] He was a very local guy! So bush!

37:36.600 --> 37:38.080
Hm. You see?

37:38.160 --> 37:40.640
Mummy didn't even think
he had any prospects.

37:40.720 --> 37:42.040
Wow, wow.

37:42.120 --> 37:45.240
-But he's proven us all wrong.
-[chuckles]

37:45.320 --> 37:48.640
And he has made a name
for himself in England.

37:48.720 --> 37:49.640
Mm.

37:50.160 --> 37:51.080
Ah!

37:53.360 --> 37:55.560
They barely gave me any stew!

37:55.640 --> 37:57.720
-Auntie.

38:24.880 --> 38:25.840
[Ola] Hey.

38:26.880 --> 38:28.760
I'm so sorry she did this to you.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.120
I was happy not having any friends.

38:34.120 --> 38:38.920
And then you came along and made me feel
like I wasn't so strange after all,

38:40.240 --> 38:41.360
but it was just a lie.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.800
You told me not to submit my story
because you said it was weird,

38:44.880 --> 38:46.160
and then you judged me.

38:47.120 --> 38:49.080
I was only trying to protect you.

38:51.760 --> 38:53.600
You shouldn't be speaking to me.

-Hey.

Thanks for sticking up for me.
What Hope did was complete bullshit.

-I know.
-And I think we should fight this.

-All right. Let's do it.
-[phone chimes]
