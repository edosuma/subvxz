"The Sorkin Notes"

01:21.297 --> 01:23.114
Eric Murphy's office.

01:23.132 --> 01:25.250
Hey, could you hold on one second?

01:26.619 --> 01:30.422
<i>I'd love to sit down with you,
tell you what I'm doing over here.</i>

01:30.456 --> 01:33.458
- I've got Sloan McQuewick.
- Maybe we could find some business to do together.

01:33.476 --> 01:35.293
<i>- Sure.
- Want to call back?</i>

01:35.311 --> 01:36.478
<i>- That'd be great.
- You got it.</i>

01:36.512 --> 01:38.463
<i>- All right, take care.
- Bye.</i>

01:39.983 --> 01:42.067
- Yeah, put her through.
- You never called her back.

01:42.101 --> 01:43.518
I know.

01:48.658 --> 01:51.660
- Hey.
- Are you seriously not calling me back?

01:51.694 --> 01:53.996
And don't tell me you've
been too busy with work

01:54.030 --> 01:56.682
Because I left you a message
before you even started the job.

01:56.716 --> 01:58.183
What, you didn't get it?

01:58.217 --> 02:00.836
Oh, I got your message. And
so did my sort-of girlfriend.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.704
Oh, sorry.

02:02.755 --> 02:05.791
Sorry that I've sort of have a girlfriend
or sorry that she got the message?

02:05.825 --> 02:07.909
I didn't know you sort of had a girlfriend.

02:07.944 --> 02:10.929
I don't anymore, so I guess you didn't
need to know that in the first place.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.931
Look, Eric, I'm
sorry. I just--

02:12.966 --> 02:14.599
No, I know. It's not your fault.

02:14.634 --> 02:17.269
I was gonna call you back too.
Things just-- they've been crazy.

02:17.303 --> 02:20.305
- Why, what happened?
- We think Vince has a stalker.

02:20.340 --> 02:22.691
God, really? What are you gonna do?

02:22.725 --> 02:25.560
- Ari's got us meeting with some security experts.
- Ari on your cell.

02:25.611 --> 02:28.714
<i>- That's good.
- Uh, yeah, I have to go meet Vince now.</i>

02:28.748 --> 02:30.315
So I've kinda gotta take off.

02:30.349 --> 02:32.401
Okay.  Um...

02:32.452 --> 02:33.802
I'll let you go then.

02:33.836 --> 02:36.121
- Okay.
- Okay.

02:36.155 --> 02:40.993
Eric, I was calling you because I wanted
to make sure you weren't mad at me.

02:41.027 --> 02:43.328
<i>- Sloan, I'm not mad at you.
- Okay, good.</i>

02:43.362 --> 02:45.731
<i>- We'll talk soon.
- Okay, I'll talk to you later.</i>

02:45.765 --> 02:47.749
- Bye.
- Bye.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.803
- Yo.
- Keep me on hold longer.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.056
<i>Sorry, I actually have to work nowadays.</i>

02:54.090 --> 02:56.425
I'm glad you finally admit the
last five years of your life

02:56.476 --> 02:58.593
- Were all a fantasy provided by me.
- What's up?

02:58.644 --> 03:01.212
- Aren't I seeing you in a few minutes?
- I'm not going to make it.

03:01.230 --> 03:02.898
I just wanted to assure you as I
did Vince

03:02.932 --> 03:05.050
<i>Aaron Cohn knows what's what. Trust him,</i>

03:05.084 --> 03:07.652
Listen to him, this is serious business.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.988
<i>- No, I understand.
- Call me right after.</i>

03:10.023 --> 03:12.107
- I will. -
I gotta-- go.

03:14.177 --> 03:17.162
What the hell's going
on? Huh?  What the--

03:17.196 --> 03:19.431
Don't worry, Mr. Gold, he's not dead.

03:19.465 --> 03:21.700
- I felt for a pulse.
- Everyone get out of here!

03:21.734 --> 03:24.669
Or I'm going to be checking
all of you for a pulse

03:24.704 --> 03:27.005
And not finding one!

03:27.040 --> 03:28.924
How long has he been like this?

03:28.958 --> 03:31.043
He hasn't moved in the
20 minutes I've been here.

03:31.077 --> 03:32.427
Jesus Christ. Barbara here?

03:32.462 --> 03:34.546
It's before noon, Ari. She's not here yet.

03:34.580 --> 03:36.314
I mean "Mr. Gold." It's before noon!

03:36.349 --> 03:38.467
- Vanish!
- Yes, sir.

03:41.404 --> 03:43.372
Wake up!

03:43.406 --> 03:45.557
What time is it?

03:45.591 --> 03:48.276
It's time for you to wake up and tell
me why you think this is a Holiday Inn.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.978
God.

03:50.029 --> 03:52.364
I didn't sleep last night
at all. I'm in a daze.

03:52.398 --> 03:56.051
I'm sorry I'm in your
office, but my couch sucks.

03:56.085 --> 03:57.936
- Are you on drugs?
- Drugs?!

03:57.954 --> 03:59.988
- Coke, dust, smack...
-Ari, no!

04:00.039 --> 04:01.790
No, I took a sleeping pill.

04:01.824 --> 04:04.993
- Or maybe two.
- Why didn't you take it at home?

04:05.044 --> 04:07.079
I don't have a home anymore, officially.

04:07.113 --> 04:09.614
- Why, what did you do now?
- It wasn't me, it was my wife.

04:09.632 --> 04:12.167
- I spoke to her. She forgave you.
- No!

04:12.218 --> 04:14.886
She can't forgive me-- she won't.
She told me I can't live there.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.600
- You can't live here!
- This all happened late last night.

04:17.620 --> 04:20.170
I was going to go to you house
but I thought this would be better.

04:20.250 --> 04:22.600
- A hotel would have been better.
- I don't have any money.

04:22.628 --> 04:24.840
I told you, she controls all of it.

04:24.845 --> 04:26.798
She turned off all of my
credit. I had my company cards,

04:26.816 --> 04:29.067
But I thought I didn't want to
use it for personal expenses.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.687
- Good thinking.
- And I set my Berry alarm for 5:30.

04:32.738 --> 04:36.358
- I didn't expect to sleep...
- How are you going to handle Sorkin today?

04:36.409 --> 04:39.310
<i>The same way that I have been handling him.</i>

04:39.328 --> 04:42.063
I'm fine, Ari. Aaron Sorkin will be

04:42.098 --> 04:44.315
Signed, sealed and delivered

04:44.333 --> 04:45.851
To this agency today,

04:45.885 --> 04:48.587
If I have to finance every
future project of his myself.

04:48.621 --> 04:51.790
- With what money?
- I'm prepared for this. I just need to wake up.

04:51.824 --> 04:54.459
And change.

04:54.493 --> 04:56.845
Yes! And change.

05:06.439 --> 05:09.224
Who just walked through my
lobby in a robe and pajamas?

05:09.275 --> 05:12.110
- Andrew Klein.
- Where the fuck is Ari?

05:13.529 --> 05:15.447
Is this guy mossad or what?

05:15.481 --> 05:16.715
Aren't all israelis?

05:16.733 --> 05:18.650
I'll bet he's observing us right now.

05:18.685 --> 05:21.103
He's gonna come in and
grade us on our vigilance.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.655
What do you think Turtle's
face in a bong'll earn us?

05:23.690 --> 05:25.574
An "A" for calmness under pressure.

05:25.608 --> 05:28.226
I'm not gonna have to walk around
with a giant dude from now on, am I?

05:28.244 --> 05:30.462
Ari says we gotta listen to
this guy, so whatever it takes.

05:30.496 --> 05:33.415
E's all about following orders nowadays.

05:33.449 --> 05:35.734
- Hardy-har-har. -
Well, it worked for him.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.452
He listened to his long-lost love

05:37.503 --> 05:39.738
And now he's got a sweet
house and a swanky job.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.140
- Yeah, but he lost Ashley.
- Oooh, I miss Ashley.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.710
- She was spunky.
- He should call her.

05:44.744 --> 05:46.578
- Ashley or Sloan?
- Either.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.297
You guys don't think it's weird that you have

05:48.348 --> 05:50.682
- Conversations about me right in front of me?
- I don't.

05:50.717 --> 05:52.467
Sloan called today. I
was actually kind of rude.

05:52.518 --> 05:53.852
- Oh yeah?  Why?
- I don't know.

05:53.887 --> 05:56.605
I got it.

06:00.193 --> 06:03.395
- Hey.
- I'm Aaron Cohn.

06:03.429 --> 06:04.980
Eric Murphy. Come on in.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.532
Hey, Vince, how are you doing?

06:07.567 --> 06:09.768
I'm great considering
I'm surrounded by people

06:09.786 --> 06:12.037
Who are making me more
and more paranoid each day.

06:12.071 --> 06:14.272
Nobody should make you paranoid.

06:14.290 --> 06:17.910
- Now who are they?
- I'm Turtle.

06:17.944 --> 06:20.462
- I'm safe.
- I'll be the judge of that.

06:20.496 --> 06:22.547
- Hi. Aaron.
- I'm aware,

06:22.582 --> 06:24.700
As I'm sure you're aware I'm Johnny Chase.

06:24.734 --> 06:27.869
So you use no alarm system at all?

06:27.904 --> 06:31.006
Just our trusty attack dog.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.894
Well, we'd better reinforce the windows.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.997
- With what?
- Steel frame around the edges,

06:39.032 --> 06:41.099
Bulletproof glass.

06:41.133 --> 06:43.268
I don't want anything coming through these.

06:43.302 --> 06:46.488
<i>- Nothing gets in, nothing gets out.
- What if there's a fire?</i>

06:46.522 --> 06:48.974
Get a hose. Vince, here's
what we're gonna do.

06:48.992 --> 06:51.076
We're gonna turn this
house into Fort Knox..

06:51.110 --> 06:54.112
Armored Windows, Hi-Res
Cameras and Around-The-Clock

06:54.146 --> 06:57.866
Vip Protection from the finest
trained predators on God's planet.

06:57.917 --> 07:01.036
- Is all this really necessary?
- Is it really necessary

07:01.087 --> 07:02.955
To waste my time with stupid questions?

07:02.989 --> 07:04.790
That's not nice. Is that nice?

07:04.824 --> 07:08.293
I'm talking a real
Multi-Layered Security System.

07:08.327 --> 07:12.664
We have a specific threat. We have an
individual who's already crossed the line.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.000
You'll have three to five men
stationed here in the house

07:15.018 --> 07:17.002
And two will follow you wherever you go.

07:17.020 --> 07:20.138
- How much is this gonna cost?
- I take a $100,000 retainer

07:20.172 --> 07:23.775
And then I'll put together the budget
for getting your full system put in place.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.027
- Jesus.
- Wow.

07:25.061 --> 07:27.646
There's 600 grand sitting in your driveway.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.132
Tell me what's worth more--
your cars or your head?

07:32.735 --> 07:34.286
- I'm not gonna fire him!
- Then I will.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.772
On what grounds? That he
wore his pajamas to work?

07:36.806 --> 07:38.940
On the grounds that he is
a distraction and a mess.

07:38.975 --> 07:42.828
He's having some domestic disturbances.
Christ, how many have you had?

07:42.862 --> 07:45.847
- Show some sympathy.
- I have zero for him,

07:45.882 --> 07:48.300
- And zero for you.
- I don't need any.

07:48.334 --> 07:50.302
Oh yes, you do.

07:50.336 --> 07:53.505
Because your failed experiment
from the Valley is a complete bust.

07:53.539 --> 07:55.424
Everybody knows it and look at you!

07:55.475 --> 07:57.426
You're still hanging on for dear life!

07:57.477 --> 08:00.712
Listen, has the Collagen seeped
into your brainstem, babs?

08:00.730 --> 08:03.281
He is not a bust. He is killing it for us.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.268
He is just about to sign Aaron Sorkin.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.236
I've been hearing that for two months now.

08:08.271 --> 08:10.789
- Well, today is the day he's coming in.
- Bullshit.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.290
He's on the books. Go check.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.610
He's making us a laughingstock, Ari!

08:15.661 --> 08:18.730
People all over town are hearing
all about these little instances.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.733
Go tell them today is pajama
Wednesday; we're industry leaders.

08:21.751 --> 08:25.303
If he doesn't sign Aaron Sorkin today,

08:25.338 --> 08:29.007
You're firing
him-- or I am.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.797
Lloyd!

08:37.433 --> 08:40.385
- Yes, sir, Mr. Gold.
- Get Andrew Alein in here right now.

08:43.756 --> 08:45.974
<i>Go!</i>

08:59.489 --> 09:02.491
Let's run it again.
I need to shave off 5 seconds.

09:08.247 --> 09:11.249
How was that? Did I seem
like I was in real jeopardy?

09:11.283 --> 09:13.201
I thought you were a little over the top.

09:13.236 --> 09:15.253
Maybe you should play Vince next time.

09:15.287 --> 09:17.889
Drama, you're flesh and blood--
it makes it more realistic.

09:17.924 --> 09:20.291
- Well, not really.
- Reset!  Drama.

09:20.309 --> 09:23.028
- I think I'm gonna sit this one out.
- Pussy.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.313
I need a visiting girlfriend this time.

09:25.348 --> 09:27.649
Turtle.

09:29.185 --> 09:31.636
- Oh, come on, Vin!
- I'd really hate to be unprepared.

09:31.671 --> 09:33.655
Let's go, bitch.

09:33.689 --> 09:36.191
- Yo,Turtle, let me get that camera.
- Yo, E, no.

09:36.242 --> 09:39.528
I've got the room wired. You can
watch it downstairs on the monitors.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.446
- Come on, let's go.
- Enjoy!

09:44.117 --> 09:46.585
- Turtle?
- Yeah, Drama?

09:46.619 --> 09:48.487
Tell me a story.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.488
I know I should be worried,

09:50.506 --> 09:52.674
But this is not a bad way to start out a day.

09:52.708 --> 09:54.509
- No.
- How's your day?

09:54.544 --> 09:56.094
- It's okay.
- Just okay?

09:56.129 --> 09:58.463
- Come on, are you all right?
- Yeah, totally.

09:58.497 --> 10:00.182
- Sloan in your head?
- No!

10:00.216 --> 10:02.050
E, you're very easy to read.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.636
<i>- Go! - You're right-- Sloan's
in my head, so is Ashley.</i>

10:04.670 --> 10:07.072
It's not a bad head.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.674
- Oh, shit.
- Jesus.

10:09.709 --> 10:12.343
I don't know, I was kind of
rude to Sloan this morning.

10:12.361 --> 10:14.613
So call her back. She's
been calling you for days.

10:14.647 --> 10:16.431
She obviously wants to talk.

10:16.466 --> 10:18.400
Yeah.

10:18.434 --> 10:21.119
Yeah, you're right.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.488
I'm gonna call her.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.375
<i>Hello?</i>

10:27.410 --> 10:28.894
- Hey.
- Eric?

10:28.928 --> 10:30.745
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey.</i>

10:30.780 --> 10:33.165
<i>- Hey.
- What's up?</i>

10:33.199 --> 10:37.369
- Just calling to say hi.
- Oh. Hi.

10:37.403 --> 10:39.304
I'm sorry if I was a little rude earlier.

10:39.338 --> 10:41.840
No...No.

10:41.874 --> 10:44.476
<i>- I shouldn't have been.
- Well, probably not.</i>

10:44.510 --> 10:46.294
<i>- Why were you?
- I don't know.</i>

10:46.329 --> 10:48.346
And I never said thank you
for helping me get the job.

10:48.380 --> 10:50.215
I'm loving the place so far, so thank you.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.267
<i>- You're welcome.
- Thanks.</i>

10:52.318 --> 10:57.355
Um, do you want to grab a drink later
and you can tell me all about the new job?

10:57.389 --> 10:59.891
<i>- A drink?
- Yeah, a friendly drink.</i>

10:59.909 --> 11:03.195
- I thought you didn't want to be friends anymore?
- Eric, that was weeks ago.

11:03.229 --> 11:05.280
- We can have a drink.
- Are you seeing anyone?

11:05.331 --> 11:07.532
<i>- I said a friendly drink.
- I heard you.</i>

11:07.566 --> 11:10.619
I was just curious if you were seeing
anyone. I told you I was seeing someone.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.704
I am seeing someone.

11:14.290 --> 11:17.075
<i>- So you have a boyfriend.
- We haven't put a label on it.</i>

11:17.093 --> 11:19.377
- Who is he?
- Look, let's just meet for a drink

11:19.411 --> 11:21.263
And we can catch up on everything, okay?

11:21.297 --> 11:23.581
<i>- Yeah, sure.
- How's 7:00</i>

11:23.599 --> 11:26.167
At the bazaar at the SLS Hotel?

11:26.202 --> 11:28.270
<i>- Sounds good.
- Okay, perfect.</i>

11:28.304 --> 11:29.971
I'll see you then. Bye.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.927
Why the hell is Andrew
Klein still not in my office?

11:35.945 --> 11:39.147
- His office is trying to locate him.
- What the hell does that mean?

11:39.198 --> 11:40.899
He's got Sorkin!

11:47.156 --> 11:49.708
Andrew Klein's office.

11:49.742 --> 11:52.410
- Where the hell is he?
- Ari, Ari!  He's gone missing.

11:52.444 --> 11:54.379
He's got Sorkin in 13 minutes.

11:54.413 --> 11:56.881
- I know, we were supposed to have a premeeting.
- Did you call him?

11:56.916 --> 11:59.284
- Of course. There's no answer.
- Did you call his house?

11:59.302 --> 12:02.237
- No, Ari, I didn't call his house!
- Don't get snide with me.

12:02.271 --> 12:04.089
You're the reason why you can't try his house

12:04.123 --> 12:07.125
And you're the reason no one seems
to know where he is. But I do know

12:07.143 --> 12:10.262
That we've got Aaron Sorkin coming
in and he'd better be signed today

12:10.296 --> 12:11.846
- For your sake.
- Got it.

12:11.897 --> 12:14.182
- Lloyd!
- Yes, sir, Mr. Gold.

12:14.233 --> 12:17.269
Call Andrew Klein from my
cell so my number comes up.

12:17.303 --> 12:19.638
Unless he's dead, he'll pick up.

12:19.672 --> 12:21.489
Everything okay, Ari?

12:21.524 --> 12:23.191
Why wouldn't it be?

12:25.745 --> 12:28.663
Come on, Marlo! Just open the damned door.

12:28.698 --> 12:30.982
<i>Go fuck yourself!</i>

12:31.000 --> 12:32.917
Who's that? Your little whore calling?

12:32.952 --> 12:36.288
- No, it's Ari.
- Tell him to go fuck himself too.

12:36.322 --> 12:39.257
- Hey, Ari.
- Where are you?

12:39.292 --> 12:41.543
- I'm at my house.
- Why, when you have

12:41.594 --> 12:43.461
A meeting with Aaron Sorkin in 10 minutes?

12:43.496 --> 12:46.331
I'm trying to get my notes for the
meeting but Marlo won't give them to me!

12:46.349 --> 12:48.500
You should have tattooed them
on your little whore's ass!

12:48.534 --> 12:50.185
- You let me in, Marlo!
- Fuck you.

12:50.219 --> 12:53.888
<i>- Whatever's in this house is now mine.
- Andrew!</i>

12:53.923 --> 12:56.975
- Come back to the office.
- Not without my notes, Ari.

12:57.009 --> 12:58.727
I can't do this meeting without them.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.062
That's because you are a loser.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.315
You're not smart, you're not funny

13:03.349 --> 13:04.733
And you can't fuck for shit.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.901
Do you hear this, Ari? She's unreasonable.

13:06.952 --> 13:09.020
<i>Andrew, hear this, focus on it:</i>

13:09.038 --> 13:12.574
This is the most important
meeting of your entire life.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.493
I have stuck my neck out for
you over and over and over,

13:15.527 --> 13:17.362
But if this does not go well,

13:17.380 --> 13:18.696
You are done here.

13:18.714 --> 13:21.232
- What, you're gonna fire me?!
- Barbara is.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.551
That's great. That's just
great. You hear that, Marlo?

13:23.586 --> 13:25.470
- Ari's gonna fire me.
- And why should I care?

13:25.504 --> 13:27.589
<i>Because even if we don't get back together,</i>

13:27.640 --> 13:30.141
- You need me to make money!
- Get back together?!

13:30.176 --> 13:33.378
I'd fuck Hamas before I would fuck you again.

13:33.412 --> 13:35.897
And you need to make money, my friend,

13:35.931 --> 13:38.216
Because I'm gonna take all you have!

13:38.234 --> 13:40.985
You open the goddamned door, Marlo!

13:41.020 --> 13:43.271
Andrew, you need to get in your car

13:43.322 --> 13:45.090
And drive back here right now.

13:45.124 --> 13:47.776
Not without my notes, Ari. I
have worked on them for a month.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.527
It is the key to me signing Sorkin.

13:49.561 --> 13:52.947
You don't need your notes. You
need to walk over to your car,

13:52.998 --> 13:55.400
<i>Get in and drive here right now.</i>

13:55.418 --> 13:59.671
If you do that, I promise you will be okay.

14:05.277 --> 14:06.711
Okay, fine.

14:08.547 --> 14:10.682
She is such a bitch, Ari.

14:10.716 --> 14:12.417
<i>She asked me to come back and I did.</i>

14:12.435 --> 14:14.602
- I know.
- I did everything I could.

14:14.637 --> 14:17.305
<i>- You're gonna be okay.
- She's a goddamned bitch.</i>

14:19.625 --> 14:22.610
You want your notes, motherfucker?

14:22.645 --> 14:25.313
Here they are!

14:25.364 --> 14:28.199
Don't you dare burn my Sorkin notes.

14:29.935 --> 14:32.620
- Andr...
- What do you think of that, you piece of shit?

14:32.655 --> 14:34.739
She's burning my Sorkin notes.

14:43.099 --> 14:45.817
What the fuck?

14:45.851 --> 14:47.852
- Jesus!
- Andrew!

14:56.479 --> 14:59.063
Andrew? Andrew!

14:59.098 --> 15:02.817
- Andrew!
- Aaron Sorkin's here.

15:04.403 --> 15:07.222
- Put him in the conference room.
- Andrew's not here yet.

15:07.256 --> 15:09.274
- I'll be in in five.
- Sorkin hates your guts.

15:09.308 --> 15:13.278
And I hate yours, but right now
we're all gonna have to find a way to get along.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.298
She has a boyfriend.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.250
She said they don't have a label on it.

15:19.285 --> 15:21.319
Let's just hope he puts a rubber on it.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.204
- Jesus!
- Sorry, E.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.606
You're right. The truth is

15:24.640 --> 15:27.058
The thought of her with
somebody else is making me sick.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.877
E, you haven't been with her for two years.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.146
- What did you think?
- A) I try not to think about it.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.965
And B) since I took this
job and this house for her...

15:33.999 --> 15:35.967
Aha! He admits it.

15:36.001 --> 15:37.936
I haven't been hiding it.
Since I did...

15:37.970 --> 15:40.104
I didn't think she'd go and
get a possible boyfriend.

15:40.139 --> 15:41.556
You had a possible girlfriend.

15:41.590 --> 15:43.641
I know, and I liked her and I'm
not with her because of Sloan.

15:43.675 --> 15:46.728
Sloan is all-powerful. She
stops him from getting pussy

15:46.779 --> 15:49.814
- And she won't give him any.
- I know. I should be pissed, right?

15:49.848 --> 15:51.316
- I'd be.
- I am!

15:51.350 --> 15:53.535
- What does she want from me?
- You'll have to ask her.

15:53.569 --> 15:57.205
Vince, any chance this could be
an Ex you had a bad break-up with?

15:57.239 --> 16:00.792
- Uh, I don't think so.
- We just found all these photos.

16:00.826 --> 16:03.761
If it's not a random psycho,
it could be someone you know.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.763
- That's not her.
- She's with him.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.199
- Really?
- No, not really.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.468
I obviously left them here when I moved out.

16:10.503 --> 16:13.421
- She have an axe to grind?
- No, but he does.

16:13.472 --> 16:14.889
Heh!

16:14.924 --> 16:16.591
There he is.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.776
Oh, come on. Where's Andrew Klein?

16:18.811 --> 16:21.479
- He's feeling a little under the weather.
- So he sent you?

16:21.514 --> 16:22.713
- Yes!
- But I hate you.

16:22.731 --> 16:23.998
Aaron, come on. It's been years.

16:24.033 --> 16:25.884
I'm not over it. Is Andrew coming or not?

16:25.918 --> 16:28.203
I...am confident that we can
do everything for you here.

16:28.237 --> 16:31.005
- Everything...better than anyone else in town.
- Hello, Aaron.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.641
- This is a waste of my time.
- How are you?

16:33.676 --> 16:36.177
Great, but I think you know I'm not
a big fan of yours either, Barbara.

16:36.212 --> 16:40.532
I think you'll find that whatever un-happiness you had
in the past we can change.

16:40.566 --> 16:43.868
- And now make you happy.
- Look, I like Andrew Klein.

16:43.902 --> 16:47.121
I've been talking to him for a couple of
months. He said he had the keys to my kingdom.

16:47.172 --> 16:49.240
He was going to bring me
ideas. I was going to hear them.

16:49.275 --> 16:51.175
I'm confident I can relay
those ideas to you right now.

16:51.210 --> 16:53.211
- Mr. Gold!
- I'm in the middle of a meeting.

16:53.245 --> 16:55.246
<i>- Are you kidding me?
- The meeting's over.</i>

16:55.281 --> 16:57.549
- I'm just flirting with her.
- This is an emergency.

16:57.583 --> 16:59.901
- Andrew Klein is on the phone.
- Oh good, where is he?

16:59.935 --> 17:01.286
Uh...

17:01.320 --> 17:03.738
You can speak.

17:03.772 --> 17:06.190
He's in jail.

17:16.367 --> 17:19.770
Thanks, man. I appreciate that.

17:19.788 --> 17:21.705
Hello?

17:21.740 --> 17:24.108
<i>- Hello!
- It's Ashley.</i>

17:24.126 --> 17:26.144
Hey! How are you?

17:26.178 --> 17:28.378
<i>- I'm okay, I'm fine.
- Are you sure?</i>

17:29.582 --> 17:30.848
No.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.151
Uh, I mean...

17:33.185 --> 17:35.086
I'm sorry.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.754
Why? Look, I was the asshole.

17:36.788 --> 17:37.989
<i>Yes, you were.</i>

17:38.023 --> 17:39.790
But I asked for it.

17:39.808 --> 17:41.843
I wanted you to tell me
the truth and you did.

17:41.894 --> 17:45.063
<i>- I should respect that.
- Well, I appreciate it.</i>

17:45.097 --> 17:47.365
And...I miss you.

17:49.652 --> 17:52.136
<i>Hello? Is that weird to say?</i>

17:52.154 --> 17:53.971
Uh, no! Not at all.

17:53.989 --> 17:55.940
I'm just a little surprised, that's all.

17:55.974 --> 17:57.659
I'm a freak.
I know, but...

17:57.693 --> 18:01.029
I've been thinking and I can
understand why you're not over your Ex.

18:01.063 --> 18:04.282
<i>- But if you tell me you're not together...
- We're not together.</i>

18:04.316 --> 18:06.367
We haven't been together for a long time.

18:06.418 --> 18:09.771
I was just scared that I was
some naive chick getting used.

18:09.805 --> 18:11.506
No, you weren't being used. I liked you.

18:11.540 --> 18:14.008
<i>- Still?
- Yeah, of course I still do.</i>

18:14.043 --> 18:15.093
Good. Come over.

18:15.127 --> 18:17.345
<i>- Uh, right now?
- Yeah, I want to see you.</i>

18:17.379 --> 18:19.097
<i>- Uhhh...
- It's okay if you can't.</i>

18:19.131 --> 18:21.332
<i>- I understand.
- Can I call you back in a bit?</i>

18:21.350 --> 18:24.102
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay, thanks.

18:24.136 --> 18:26.137
- Hey!
- Hello.

18:26.171 --> 18:27.722
Is everything okay?

18:27.773 --> 18:30.975
- Yeah yeah.
- All right, buddy.

18:31.009 --> 18:33.394
Let's go get that drink.

18:33.445 --> 18:36.180
You know what, Sloan?

18:36.198 --> 18:38.866
I don't feel like drinking.

18:38.901 --> 18:41.536
What do you feel like doing?

18:43.322 --> 18:45.039
- I think I should go.
- Where?

18:45.074 --> 18:48.042
Hey, buddy. Will you
hold that car up, please?

18:48.077 --> 18:49.994
You know, this was a...
This was a bad idea.

18:50.028 --> 18:51.546
I gotta go. I'm sorry.

18:51.580 --> 18:53.030
E, what the fuck?!

18:53.048 --> 18:55.166
Well, what's the point to this?

18:55.200 --> 18:57.001
<i>- The point to what?
- This!</i>

18:57.036 --> 18:59.537
First you want to be friends,
then you don't want to be friends,

18:59.555 --> 19:01.889
Now you want friendly cocktails.
You don't know what you want

19:01.924 --> 19:04.425
And I don't want to fuck it up
with a girl that I kinda like.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.911
- I'm sorry about that, man. Sorry.
- E!

19:06.945 --> 19:10.181
E! I am doing the best I can.

19:10.215 --> 19:13.685
<i>I do miss you, but I just need time.</i>

19:13.719 --> 19:16.688
You've had plenty of time, all right?
And in that time, I've found someone else.

19:16.722 --> 19:19.424
I don't want to mess it up while you're
trying to figure out what you want.

19:19.458 --> 19:22.326
Is it that girl? The young
one from the premiere?

19:22.361 --> 19:25.079
- She's 24.
- Yeah.

19:25.114 --> 19:26.531
So that's it?

19:26.565 --> 19:28.666
Yeah, I guess it is.

19:52.091 --> 19:54.692
Aaron, you didn't really
need to come down here.

19:54.727 --> 19:57.261
I tell you, Andrew. I was
so eager to hear your ideas...

19:57.279 --> 19:58.780
I would have gone anywhere.

19:58.814 --> 20:00.948
Go ahead, Andrew. Give them to him.

20:00.983 --> 20:02.700
Give them to him.

20:07.439 --> 20:10.842
Uh...

20:10.876 --> 20:13.778
Look, Aaron. You write...

20:13.812 --> 20:18.116
You produce...um...in TV and in Film.

20:18.150 --> 20:20.701
But I...

20:20.736 --> 20:24.856
I think it's time to...

20:24.890 --> 20:27.959
To conquer that
last frontier...

20:27.993 --> 20:29.393
Directing.

20:29.428 --> 20:33.064
I don't want to direct. I'm a writer.

20:33.098 --> 20:36.067
I like writing. I could have
directed years ago if I wanted to...

20:36.101 --> 20:38.669
He...he...he has more
actually. You have more...

20:38.704 --> 20:41.839
Right, Andrew?

20:41.874 --> 20:45.243
Uh...

20:45.277 --> 20:47.612
Act as if you have faith

20:47.646 --> 20:49.580
And faith shall be given to you.

20:50.866 --> 20:53.034
- Jesus, that's pathetic.
- No, he's quoting me.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.670
It's "The West Wing,"
the assassination episode.

20:55.704 --> 20:57.588
I had a lot more of your quotes written down

20:57.623 --> 21:01.392
And I had a lot of amazing
ideas, brilliant ideas,

21:01.426 --> 21:03.261
But I couldn't get into my house.

21:03.295 --> 21:06.330
My wife wouldn't let me get
them. I blew that chance.

21:06.365 --> 21:10.168
I blew my marriage, and
if I blow this with you...

21:10.202 --> 21:12.637
I've blown my career too.

21:12.671 --> 21:13.938
I'm sorry, Aaron.

21:13.972 --> 21:16.824
I drove into my own house for you, Aaron,

21:16.859 --> 21:18.359
My own...

21:18.393 --> 21:21.963
Under-Insured Over-Priced
Beverly Hills motherfucking home.

21:21.997 --> 21:25.066
I took my car and I put it in gear...

21:25.117 --> 21:28.953
And I drove right into my
own goddamn living room.

21:31.957 --> 21:35.810
For you. Who else would do that?

21:44.386 --> 21:48.973
- I'm sorry.
- I had a rough divorce too.

21:49.007 --> 21:51.592
I get it.

21:53.045 --> 21:55.046
We'll give it a shot.

21:56.715 --> 22:00.234
- Really?
- Yeah. But if he ever calls me, I'm gone.

22:31.583 --> 22:33.718
- Oh, don't you dare.
- What? I have to get it.

22:33.752 --> 22:35.469
- Why?
- Because it could be Vince.

22:35.520 --> 22:38.689
Vince is a big boy. Come
on, I need my Eric fix.

22:38.724 --> 22:42.259
Listen, Vince has a stalker and
something might have happened.

22:42.277 --> 22:44.528
- Seriously?
- Yes.

22:45.564 --> 22:47.448
Yo, everything cool?

22:47.482 --> 22:49.533
Mmm, yeah. Totally.

22:49.568 --> 22:51.836
You still with Sloan? We're
going a little stir-crazy.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.071
We're gonna take big Yoni out for some fun.

22:54.106 --> 22:56.741
<i>- I'm at Ashley's.
- Ashley's? How?</i>

22:56.775 --> 22:58.542
She's great. We're great.

22:58.577 --> 23:00.745
Uh-huh, okay.
Have fun.

23:00.779 --> 23:03.748
I will. You are gonna get me in trouble.

23:03.782 --> 23:06.116
- Where was he?
- Ashley's.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.085
- At Sloan's.
- Ashley's.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.922
- Interesting.
- Vince, you know

23:10.956 --> 23:12.456
A Curtis Tucker?

23:12.491 --> 23:14.642
- Nope.
- Well, he knows you.

23:14.676 --> 23:17.461
- Found this in the couch.
- What does that mean?

23:17.479 --> 23:20.715
It means that we may have found our stalker.
