01:27.000 --> 01:28.560
You're leaving?

01:28.640 --> 01:31.440
But I thought you and I were forever?

01:33.080 --> 01:34.600
I want you so badly.

01:34.680 --> 01:39.400
- Morgan! - But so does the Port Royal governor.

01:39.440 --> 01:43.680
He will pay well for the capture of Morgan Adams, the pirate.

01:43.760 --> 01:46.920
- You knew who I was? - All along.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.520
Morgan! Where are you?

01:49.600 --> 01:51.440
You are heartless, Lieutenant.

01:51.520 --> 01:54.440
My apologies, senorita.

01:56.160 --> 01:58.120
But you are right.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.600
I thought it was much more amusing this way also...

02:01.680 --> 02:04.360
since I knew that you knew.

02:04.440 --> 02:06.600
By the way, that won't work.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.680
See? I took your balls.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.320
What happened?

02:48.400 --> 02:51.000
Your father sent for you two days ago.

02:51.080 --> 02:52.240
I know. I was coming.

02:52.320 --> 02:55.440
He did not know this. He went looking for you.

02:55.480 --> 02:58.760
That's when Dawg grabbed him. Lord knows what he does with him.

04:43.760 --> 04:46.600
I took this from our brother Richard last week.

04:46.680 --> 04:50.160
Unwillingly. That's his blood on the borders.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.880
With your piece, all I need is Mordachai's.

04:52.960 --> 04:56.080
You're out of luck. I don't have it.

04:56.120 --> 04:58.760
Where is it? With Morgan?

04:58.840 --> 05:00.960
I haven't seen her.

05:03.920 --> 05:06.160
I think you lie, Harry.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.400
I hid it.

05:16.480 --> 05:19.400
Progress. Where?

05:20.440 --> 05:22.120
Up here.

05:23.280 --> 05:27.240
I always thought there was nothing in your head.

05:27.280 --> 05:32.240
Come back on board. I'm going to split you wide open.

05:32.320 --> 05:34.000
Mr. Snelgrave.

05:35.320 --> 05:37.040
I'll see ya in hell.

05:44.120 --> 05:45.520
Father!

05:47.280 --> 05:49.280
- Father, I've got you! - Let go! Let go!

05:49.360 --> 05:51.240
Hold onto me!

05:52.720 --> 05:55.680
- Let go! - Never!

05:59.360 --> 06:00.360
No! Father!

06:02.320 --> 06:04.200
Father!

06:06.360 --> 06:08.080
Someone get a grappling hook!

06:37.920 --> 06:40.200
Launch the cutter.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.080
Heave!

07:14.920 --> 07:18.120
Oh, Lord, what did I do in my life to get you?

07:18.200 --> 07:20.160
Dawg will pay for this, I swear.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.560
You leave Dawg be.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.600
I will fly his bloody head as my banner!

07:23.640 --> 07:27.120
You'll leave Dawg well to leeward.

07:27.160 --> 07:29.040
There will be time for him.

07:30.680 --> 07:32.560
Find your Uncle Mordachai.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.720
Take my crew. Make them yours.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.240
Father, don't talk now. I'll get you back to the ship.

07:37.320 --> 07:40.840
I'll not see my ship again. The Morning Star is yours.

07:40.920 --> 07:44.560
Don't say that. I've patched you with worse.

07:44.600 --> 07:48.800
Get your knife. Shave my head.

07:48.880 --> 07:52.320
- What? - Shave my head.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.600
For once in your life, Morgan...

07:55.640 --> 07:57.600
do as I tell you.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.760
Lieutenant.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.760
What is your name again? Plopper? Squinter?

08:30.800 --> 08:33.240
Trotter, Your Excellency.

08:33.320 --> 08:36.960
Miss Mandy Rickets is standing alone.

08:38.320 --> 08:41.480
Her father brings a fortune in investments to the colony.

08:41.559 --> 08:43.720
Dance with her.

08:47.280 --> 08:49.200
She's rather homely, sir.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.560
And you are not?

08:57.720 --> 09:00.840
There you are. You see? Too late. Some other fellow has taken the plunge.

09:01.840 --> 09:05.320
There's every reason why I should be alone tonight...

09:05.400 --> 09:06.960
being a stranger here...

09:07.960 --> 09:10.800
but a woman with grace such as yours...

09:10.840 --> 09:12.720
should never be unattended.

09:19.720 --> 09:22.560
My name is Shaw. William Shaw.

09:22.640 --> 09:25.120
But my friends call me Willy.

09:25.200 --> 09:28.000
Do we know him, sir?

09:29.040 --> 09:31.040
We do not.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.800
Are you at leisure, Mr. Shaw, or do you follow a profession?

09:33.840 --> 09:37.520
Most serious one, ma'am. I'm a medical man, a doctor.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.480
Oh, my!

09:39.560 --> 09:43.440
I studied at Leyden, then higher anatomy with Dreyfuss at Leipzig.

09:43.520 --> 09:46.760
With higher anatomy, you must know a great deal about the human body.

09:46.840 --> 09:49.480
Indeed, madam. Every bit of it.

09:49.520 --> 09:51.760
All the ins and outs.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.400
In medicine, it's our obligation to probe to the very bottom of things.

10:02.240 --> 10:05.320
We must, in fact, explode ancient superstitions...

10:05.400 --> 10:08.680
shake truths violently from the body.

10:24.120 --> 10:27.480
You, sir! Forgive my rudeness.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.960
Trotter's the name. I'm with the regiment.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.960
William Shaw. Dr. Shaw, in fact.

10:33.040 --> 10:37.120
Most happy. What ship did you come in on, Doctor?

10:37.200 --> 10:39.840
Was it the Bristol packet?

10:39.920 --> 10:41.760
Bristol packet? Bristol packet?

10:41.840 --> 10:43.680
I believe that was it, although I can't be sure.

10:43.760 --> 10:45.640
I'm all at sea when it comes to things nautical.

10:47.360 --> 10:50.640
Very good. No, the reason I asked...

10:50.680 --> 10:54.320
is the Bristol packet don't arrive until a week Wednesday.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.920
That's him! That man stole my diamond comb!

10:58.000 --> 11:00.200
My pearls! My pearl dangles!

11:00.280 --> 11:01.600
My ruby necklace!

11:01.680 --> 11:04.360
- Sergeant of the guard! - Women!

11:04.400 --> 11:06.480
Sergeant of the guard!

11:14.560 --> 11:17.320
Good night, ladies!

11:20.080 --> 11:21.960
Excuse me. Pardon me.

11:30.840 --> 11:32.720
His name's Shaw, sir.

11:32.760 --> 11:36.520
I trust you'll enjoy life as a slave, Mr. Shaw.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.440
Whoever you are.

11:48.280 --> 11:50.400
That's good. Tie it off!

11:54.320 --> 11:57.520
Morgan, think of the freedom.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.720
You can do anything you want now.

11:59.760 --> 12:04.720
Come to London with me. Come to London with me.

12:04.800 --> 12:09.520
There are dukes there. There are earls and parties.

12:09.600 --> 12:12.120
It'll be fun. Think of how much fun it'd be.

12:12.200 --> 12:15.040
Besides, these men aren't gonna take orders from you.

12:15.120 --> 12:18.800
They will! Watch. You there.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.080
Stand to. Hoist my pennant.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.040
Bring it here.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.520
Mutiny, will ya?

12:38.040 --> 12:40.480
I was hoping to find you sober.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.880
I was hoping to be passed out by now, Mr. Glasspoole.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.840
Important things go on overhead.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.800
Morgan, you should be there.

12:59.440 --> 13:02.160
Men, Black Harry is gone.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.400
I'm not one to speak ill of the dead...

13:04.480 --> 13:06.800
but for months he brought us nothing.

13:06.880 --> 13:10.440
So now we can either sell this rotten bark and divvy up...

13:10.520 --> 13:12.800
or you can choose me captain.

13:17.440 --> 13:18.800
I stand for captain.

13:20.480 --> 13:21.840
My father wished it.

13:21.920 --> 13:25.840
As he died, he gave me this.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.080
He left it for all of you.

13:30.160 --> 13:32.000
That's his bloody scalp.

13:33.240 --> 13:36.360
It's a map to Cutthroat Island...

13:36.440 --> 13:39.040
the buried treasure of a Spanish gold ship.

13:39.120 --> 13:41.960
More gold, jewels and plunder than you've ever dreamed of.

13:42.040 --> 13:44.000
What does it say?

13:44.080 --> 13:45.800
Aye.

13:46.840 --> 13:48.560
It says--

13:50.800 --> 13:52.160
You read it.

13:59.320 --> 14:01.640
- I can't. - Why not?

14:01.680 --> 14:03.440
It's Latin.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.040
Then I will have it translated at once.

14:07.120 --> 14:09.960
There must be someone who knows Latin at Port Royal.

14:10.040 --> 14:13.480
My Uncle Mordachai holds a second piece at Spittlefield.

14:13.560 --> 14:15.080
There's more than one piece?

14:15.960 --> 14:17.600
Actually, there are three.

14:17.680 --> 14:21.800
- Where's the third? - Dawg Brown has it.

14:21.840 --> 14:25.640
Oh, well! It's practically in our pocket.

14:25.720 --> 14:28.280
We'll fight him for it. We'll join with Mordachai.

14:28.360 --> 14:30.560
Two ships against one. You should like them odds.

14:30.640 --> 14:33.480
Ask yourselves. What would Harry have done?

14:33.560 --> 14:36.880
This is our chance to seek some real fortune...

14:36.920 --> 14:38.920
and to pay back Dawg what we owe him.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.680
What could be better than that?

14:41.760 --> 14:46.320
Mr. Blair, you are quartermaster.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.880
You decide.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.600
Two days is all I need.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.720
One to Port Royal, one to Spittlefield.

14:55.760 --> 15:00.040
If Harry picked you, I'll give you a chance.

15:06.480 --> 15:09.280
Let any man who would challenge me draw that.

15:16.880 --> 15:19.360
I found him. He's a prisoner inside. He speaks Latin.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.280
Good. Let's break him out.

15:21.360 --> 15:25.120
Unfortunately, Captain-- I mean, ma'am, he's about to be sold as a slave.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.680
A slave.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.760
They're hanging the pirates. They're gonna find you out.

15:29.840 --> 15:31.760
You worry too much. Don't I look right?

15:31.840 --> 15:33.280
You look beautiful.

15:33.360 --> 15:35.760
It's just that I'm the only person here who has the slightest inkling...

15:35.840 --> 15:38.760
of how to act like a gentleperson, so I have to go with you.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.440
- Then you shall come. - But, unfortunately, I can't.

15:41.520 --> 15:45.520
I have pressing business with my bookseller.

15:45.560 --> 15:47.840
- The fat man is right. - I'll see you at Spittlefield.

15:47.920 --> 15:49.960
You must be at your best behavior.

15:50.040 --> 15:54.160
Then, gallant sir, escort me thither.

16:05.720 --> 16:07.560
Turn around.

16:13.680 --> 16:17.000
- You. On your feet. - Ask me politely.

16:19.440 --> 16:22.800
You anticipate too much. It's more like a fencing move.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.080
Any fool can do it.

16:28.440 --> 16:31.640
I hope you enjoy pain, slave.

16:31.720 --> 16:34.960
Because I intend to buy you.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.600
Good morning, madam.

16:48.680 --> 16:53.120
As you can see, I'm young, in fine health.
I know horsemanship.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.040
I write a fine hand.

16:55.120 --> 16:57.360
I have it on authority that you are fluent in Latin.

16:58.280 --> 17:00.600
Ah, Latin, the Romance language.

17:00.680 --> 17:03.200
I can speak Latin like I was born in the ancient Senate.

17:03.280 --> 17:05.520
A regular Cicero. Why? Do you have children who wish to learn?

17:05.599 --> 17:08.400
I'd make a first-class teacher in a tasteful country house.

17:08.480 --> 17:11.680
I can do most arithmetic,
though I confess a weakness in long division.

17:11.760 --> 17:14.000
Stop your chatter and say something Latinish.

17:29.920 --> 17:31.280
What did you say?

17:32.080 --> 17:36.120
You're a very beautiful woman. I'd like to wash your feet.

17:39.320 --> 17:42.320
You like to wash things, do you?

17:42.400 --> 17:44.240
Start with your mouth.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.440
Ten pounds?

17:52.520 --> 17:55.040
Five pounds? What? No offers at all?

17:55.120 --> 17:57.000
Take him away and hang him.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.440
Next!

17:59.480 --> 18:02.240
Please! Don't hang me!

18:05.280 --> 18:06.560
Next!

18:07.600 --> 18:09.720
Lot 22!

18:09.800 --> 18:12.880
A colonist. A doctor.

18:12.920 --> 18:16.640
Being of value, I start the bidding at five pounds.

18:16.720 --> 18:20.360
- I bid five pounds. - Five pounds, sir.

18:20.440 --> 18:22.640
Go on. Any advance on five pounds?

18:22.720 --> 18:24.560
He's of good physique.

18:24.640 --> 18:27.480
- Ten pounds. - Ten pounds!

18:27.560 --> 18:29.920
- Any advance on ten pounds? - Fifteen.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.800
- Fifteen pounds, sir. - Twenty pounds.

18:33.880 --> 18:38.920
- Twenty pounds is the bid. - Sir, a word to the wise.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.760
- Let the young lady win. - You won't get one like this.

18:41.840 --> 18:46.480
- Being a doctor, he's-- - Go away! That one is mine.

18:46.520 --> 18:49.840
- Twenty-five pounds. - Twenty-five pounds, sir.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.160
Good teeth.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.840
- Thirty pounds! - Thirty pounds!

18:53.920 --> 18:58.000
Madam, I will have this man at any price.

18:58.080 --> 19:02.040
If you are buying him purely for pleasure...

19:02.120 --> 19:06.280
I will offer to do the same for you at no cost.

19:06.320 --> 19:08.760
A doctor!

19:09.760 --> 19:12.920
- Thirty-five pounds! - Thirty-five pounds, sir.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.040
A sensible choice, indeed. Go on.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.360
Captain, no!

19:17.400 --> 19:19.440
Where's your sense of competition?

19:35.680 --> 19:37.360
Come on! Someone give me more than 35!

19:37.400 --> 19:39.520
You, sir, you haven't bid.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.480
Look at him. Look at the quality.

19:41.560 --> 19:45.360
And you, madam, another bid? Any advance on 35.

19:45.400 --> 19:48.400
I hope the lady is prepared to be a good loser.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.480
What gave you the idea I was a lady?

19:52.960 --> 19:57.520
Another bid, sir? I see your lips moving. Yes?

19:57.600 --> 19:59.440
Are you trying to kill me, madam?

19:59.520 --> 20:01.560
Yes, that's why I'm aiming where your brains are.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.840
Now leave this place and go far away.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.440
Don't retreat now, sir. Where are you going?

20:09.520 --> 20:12.440
- Don't surrender this opportunity. - Forty pounds to end the bidding.

20:12.520 --> 20:15.280
Sold to the lady with the monkey.

20:15.320 --> 20:17.680
Take him away.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.800
Go on! Move!

20:23.960 --> 20:27.840
Of course, I'm grateful, madam. You picked a bargain.

20:27.920 --> 20:30.360
I'm connected to all the great families of Europe.

20:30.440 --> 20:32.280
- I have a natural pitch for music... - Quiet!

20:32.360 --> 20:33.880
and a perfect taste in wine.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.840
Enemy to leeward, Captain.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.120
Starboard as well, Captain.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.280
Time to leave.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.080
You draw them away. We'll meet at Dingley Crossroads.

20:47.160 --> 20:49.920
- Take King Charles. Come on. - Aye.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.800
It's Morgan Adams! She's at the auction!

21:11.760 --> 21:13.360
Shoot to kill!

21:32.320 --> 21:36.440
If I am in some way the cause of all this, I apologize at once.

21:38.920 --> 21:42.160
Here. Come here. Hold on there. Hold on tight.

21:42.240 --> 21:44.560
Try to keep up with me.

21:50.760 --> 21:52.720
I am not fond of heights!

21:52.800 --> 21:54.440
Then let go!

22:06.920 --> 22:09.040
Lieutenant Trotter!

22:09.120 --> 22:11.480
What's going on?

22:11.560 --> 22:13.400
Something with Mr. Shaw, I believe.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.880
I'm in favor of exercise, but you owe me an explanation.

22:30.520 --> 22:32.720
Come here. Come on. We have to climb down here.

22:33.600 --> 22:34.480
Fast!

22:43.120 --> 22:44.520
- Where'd they go? - There!

22:44.600 --> 22:46.480
Was that fast enough?

22:55.400 --> 22:56.960
Come on!

23:03.560 --> 23:06.280
Get the reins! Grab them!

23:06.320 --> 23:07.760
Come on! Go!

23:18.800 --> 23:20.320
Mr. Trotter!

23:21.360 --> 23:23.400
That's my bloody carriage.

23:23.480 --> 23:25.920
I'll have it back, if you please. You, off.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.760
Yes, sir. Don't worry, sir. He won't get far.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.920
Reload!

23:36.000 --> 23:39.240
It's hard to imagine what part of your life would require Latin!

23:39.320 --> 23:40.840
Reload!

23:49.080 --> 23:50.880
- We've taken a passenger! - Here!

24:03.360 --> 24:05.600
You're hitting a woman!

24:23.640 --> 24:26.680
Captain Perkins, sir!

24:26.760 --> 24:29.600
- Yes? - It's her! Morgan Adams!

24:32.640 --> 24:35.440
You're more active than other women I've known.

25:19.080 --> 25:22.120
Morgan! Watch your head!

25:28.880 --> 25:30.400
Charge!

25:53.840 --> 25:56.080
Excuse me!

25:58.120 --> 25:59.960
Excuse me!

26:09.360 --> 26:12.120
Stop them!

26:12.200 --> 26:14.960
I must visit that shop again when I have more time.

26:16.600 --> 26:20.160
- Master gunner, fire at will. - Run 'em up!

26:21.720 --> 26:23.120
Fire!

26:33.840 --> 26:35.160
A ship!

26:35.240 --> 26:38.360
I find myself being fired upon by an entire ship!

26:55.520 --> 26:56.720
Oh, my God.

26:56.800 --> 26:59.920
You certainly left your mark on this town.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.880
Hold on! Whoa!

27:03.920 --> 27:09.240
Trotter, do you want to spend the rest of your days on this poxy island?

27:09.320 --> 27:12.240
- Who was that woman? - Morgan Adams, sir.

27:12.320 --> 27:14.240
You've 100 pounds on her head.

27:14.320 --> 27:15.920
Black Harry's girl.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.760
Well, well. She's made a proper fool of me, hasn't she?

27:21.200 --> 27:24.440
Two hundred pounds and a captaincy for you
if you find her for me.

27:25.720 --> 27:27.120
Sir!

27:34.680 --> 27:36.560
- Any difficulties? - Nothing unusual.

27:36.600 --> 27:39.080
Here. Step down into the carriage.

27:39.160 --> 27:41.640
- Will you take the reins? - Aye.

27:41.720 --> 27:44.400
We should make Spittlefield by dark.

27:46.080 --> 27:47.840
What is your name anyway, slave?

27:47.920 --> 27:50.680
Shaw. William Shaw. Dr. Shaw, actually.

27:50.760 --> 27:54.360
Slave, I'm about to show you something.

27:54.440 --> 27:58.200
Reveal it to any other man, and you will wish you were back at Port Royal...

27:58.280 --> 28:01.080
with your head on the block and the ax in the air.

28:01.160 --> 28:03.680
Thank you, but I've seen one before.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.960
What is this? A pigskin?

28:14.000 --> 28:15.440
Translate what is written there.

28:17.160 --> 28:20.680
Let's discuss terms first. I do so, and you set me free.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.880
That's tender.

28:29.960 --> 28:31.880
It's about to become more tender.

28:33.560 --> 28:34.680
They're backwards.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.680
I assure you, ma'am, they're normal in every respect.

28:38.760 --> 28:41.280
No, the words. They're written backwards.

28:41.360 --> 28:43.280
Look. Can you see?

28:43.360 --> 28:46.960
''Cliffs of blood.'' Bless me.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.400
You're right.

28:50.720 --> 28:55.040
You tell Mr. Squeakum's that I will send him a new chapter every month.

28:55.120 --> 28:59.720
- Now, what's this all about? - He's a great admirer of your books.

28:59.800 --> 29:03.920
That makes me happy. Which books has he read? Did he mention?

29:03.960 --> 29:08.200
His Excellency Governor Ainslee, John Reed, the author...

29:08.240 --> 29:10.000
currently the chronicler of piracy.

29:10.040 --> 29:13.720
Step up, sir. Always a pleasure to meet a literary man.

29:13.800 --> 29:16.760
- I'd just as soon walk. - I insist.

29:16.840 --> 29:18.840
I can do that, you know.

29:20.320 --> 29:23.600
''When the earth and all its people quake-- Psalm, number 75.

29:23.640 --> 29:27.680
My bones suffer mortal agony. Number 42.''

29:27.760 --> 29:29.600
- And? - That's all.

29:30.800 --> 29:33.160
- No position? No parallel? - I swear it, ma'am.

29:33.240 --> 29:34.960
That's all that's here.

29:38.560 --> 29:41.920
Piracy, Mr. Reed, is the scourge of these plantations.

29:42.000 --> 29:47.320
I, therefore, give rather large rewards for the capture of pirates...

29:47.400 --> 29:49.440
including Morgan Adams.

29:50.240 --> 29:52.080
I don't know who she is.

29:52.160 --> 29:56.240
Trotter tells me that you move throughout the pirate world...

29:56.320 --> 29:58.160
collecting your little tales.

29:59.920 --> 30:01.640
Dangerous.

30:01.720 --> 30:06.040
If by some chance you come across her,
you might tell her on my behalf...

30:06.120 --> 30:08.480
that I offer her two alternatives.

30:08.560 --> 30:13.200
One, an ignominious death on the gallows
like these poor fellows here.

30:13.240 --> 30:18.320
Please bear in mind that I could decide you're a pirate as well.

30:19.640 --> 30:21.520
And the alternative?

30:22.560 --> 30:25.000
She might cut me in for a share...

30:25.080 --> 30:27.600
of her grandfather's treasure...

30:27.680 --> 30:30.800
or she ends up as dinner for crows.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.480
Pull up!

30:34.600 --> 30:38.320
Good day, Mr. Reed. Do you understand me, sir?

31:06.400 --> 31:09.040
Here. Here's a good one.

31:09.080 --> 31:11.280
You blackguard!

31:11.360 --> 31:13.560
Can you spare a little, lady?

31:39.720 --> 31:41.600
Mordachai's up there, scared as a goose.

31:41.680 --> 31:44.080
He's surrounded by guards, back to the wall, pistols out.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.320
He's expecting Dawg.

31:46.400 --> 31:49.960
If there are any of Dawg's men around, they will see you.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.360
Mordachai's guards won't let you get close.

31:57.680 --> 31:59.200
Wait a minute.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.240
Excuse me. Excuse me.

32:02.480 --> 32:03.760
How much?

32:04.560 --> 32:07.160
- What? - Come with me.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.720
You stay put.

32:28.040 --> 32:29.880
Where do you think you're going?

32:29.960 --> 32:33.480
Tapster sent me. Said the old turtle has his needs.

32:33.560 --> 32:34.920
Shake her down.

32:45.360 --> 32:48.600
- Sweetheart, all that costs money. - I have money.

32:48.680 --> 32:52.120
I promise. I will take care of you later.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.080
Follow me.

32:56.080 --> 32:58.040
You too.

32:59.160 --> 33:01.560
Captain, you in the mood for a whore?

33:02.840 --> 33:04.200
Show her in.

33:08.200 --> 33:12.080
Wait a minute. I recognize you.

33:12.160 --> 33:14.040
You're not a whore.

33:15.240 --> 33:18.000
Call your men, and it's the last sound you make.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.320
You're Harry's girl.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.080
You always were trouble. Blast ya.

33:28.160 --> 33:30.120
What do you want here, eh?

33:35.520 --> 33:37.600
I've brought my father's map.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.120
You have the map?

33:40.640 --> 33:43.360
- What about the Morning Star, the ship? - She's mine.

33:43.440 --> 33:46.040
Here. Look what I'm doing.

33:47.560 --> 33:51.160
Holy Virgin. Harry's blessed head.

33:51.240 --> 33:54.160
See? Is that not fine?

33:54.240 --> 33:57.360
That's handsome of ya. Mighty handsome.

33:57.400 --> 34:01.080
But with you here, you bet your life Dawg's around somewhere.

34:01.160 --> 34:04.280
I'm not afraid of Dawg. I'm half your age and nowhere near the sailor.

34:04.360 --> 34:08.280
You shame me, lass. I don't like that.

34:08.360 --> 34:10.120
Then get up and fight! Prove me wrong.

34:10.159 --> 34:15.440
I've heard of Cutthroat Island. I always thought it was a sailor's yarn.

34:15.520 --> 34:19.920
Piles of skulls. Reefs of sailors' drowned bones.

34:20.000 --> 34:24.159
This treasure is ours. Or would be...

34:25.080 --> 34:27.440
if you were an Adams.

34:28.440 --> 34:31.280
There's no water in Adams blood.

34:32.280 --> 34:35.080
I'll do it. I'll join with ya.

34:47.080 --> 34:49.440
Just like Harry, mine's well hid.

35:03.160 --> 35:06.600
Unfinished business from the other night, Morgan.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.200
Let her stand, Mr. Snelgrave.

35:37.680 --> 35:42.000
Morgan, what a woman you've become.

35:43.560 --> 35:45.840
I knew you'd bring him here, Morgan. Blast ya!

35:45.920 --> 35:47.120
Hello, brother Mordachai.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.600
Morgan, in sweet memory...

35:57.680 --> 36:00.640
of bouncing you on my knee as a little girl...

36:00.720 --> 36:05.320
I'm going to ask you just once for your daddy's piece of the map.

36:05.360 --> 36:08.240
Would you settle for the point of my cutlass?

36:08.320 --> 36:11.560
Somehow I knew you would say something like that.

36:11.600 --> 36:15.320
And then we'd fall to oaths and threats.

36:15.400 --> 36:18.320
Let's cut through the talk, shall we?

36:20.880 --> 36:24.000
I have just the thing for you, little niece.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.680
This says it all, Morgan.

36:43.760 --> 36:48.160
Pain. Viciousness. Mutilation.

36:48.240 --> 36:51.440
All the good things in life. My coat of arms.

36:52.880 --> 36:54.960
Ugly, slippery and foul smelling.

36:55.040 --> 36:56.600
- It does say it all. - Yes.

36:56.680 --> 36:58.360
- And it looks like you. - Thank you.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.440
We stay close together. We're family.

37:17.480 --> 37:19.320
- Captain! - Bowen! Get back to the ship!

37:19.400 --> 37:21.000
Bring the men!

37:27.640 --> 37:30.920
You think you might unlock these now?
Given the circumstances.

37:30.960 --> 37:32.240
I don't have the key here.

37:32.320 --> 37:34.680
- Where is it? - They never gave me one.

37:34.760 --> 37:36.200
What?

37:43.920 --> 37:46.880
The map. Tell me where it is, or I'll run you through!

38:01.960 --> 38:05.400
Hey! You killed my brother!

38:30.000 --> 38:32.400
I saw that, little niece.

38:32.480 --> 38:34.600
I remember when you were a little girl.

38:34.680 --> 38:37.480
Always flinched when you saw your Uncle Douglas, didn't ya?

38:37.520 --> 38:40.280
Give me the map! Where's the map?

38:40.360 --> 38:41.800
Give me the map!

39:27.760 --> 39:30.560
Sweetheart, I promised I'd take care of you.

39:37.840 --> 39:39.800
- Very pretty, Mr. Shaw. - Thank you, ma'am.

39:39.880 --> 39:42.640
I had the good fortune to study with a grand master in Vienna.

39:45.920 --> 39:48.400
Stop diddling and kill the man.

39:48.480 --> 39:51.240
Kill him? Bless me. We never got to that.

39:51.280 --> 39:52.680
I see.

39:56.040 --> 39:58.240
Come on!

40:05.560 --> 40:07.440
I believe you have something of mine, Mr. Shaw.

40:07.480 --> 40:10.360
Ma'am, I don't know what you're talking about.

40:26.800 --> 40:29.880
- Blair! - This way, Morgan!

41:11.080 --> 41:13.880
This does you no good on the ground, Mr. Bowen.

41:19.240 --> 41:20.360
The numbers.

41:23.120 --> 41:26.160
- What were the numbers? - What numbers?

41:26.240 --> 41:30.400
- The Psalms. - 11, 75 and 42.

41:31.720 --> 41:34.920
I figured it out. It's the longitude.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.320
- We must leave now. - It's the longitude.

41:41.840 --> 41:43.040
- Back to the ship. - Move!

41:44.880 --> 41:46.360
Hurry!

41:52.240 --> 41:53.520
Come along, men.

41:53.560 --> 41:56.680
Congratulations, madam. There's another town you've destroyed.

42:05.840 --> 42:07.440
Get along lively!

42:13.360 --> 42:15.000
Heave!

42:17.800 --> 42:19.680
Heave!

42:21.360 --> 42:23.080
You've been in a fight. You all right?

42:23.120 --> 42:26.320
It's just a scratch. Somebody, cut off his chains.

42:26.360 --> 42:27.720
Nice ship.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.240
Why aren't I moving?

42:58.120 --> 43:01.400
Did you hear me, Mr. Bishop? I said, why aren't I moving?

43:01.480 --> 43:03.280
- The anchors fouled, Captain. - Cut it loose.

43:03.360 --> 43:05.240
Aye, aye, sir. Quickly.

43:05.320 --> 43:08.840
We can't leave yet, Captain. We haven't put enough food on board.

43:08.880 --> 43:11.160
We need less mouths.

43:14.680 --> 43:16.960
Does no one hear me on this ship?

43:17.040 --> 43:20.640
I distinctly said... cut it loose!

43:44.040 --> 43:45.520
75...

43:46.400 --> 43:49.160
42... 11.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.200
Keep her full!

44:32.240 --> 44:34.600
Let me show you the chart.

44:36.840 --> 44:41.160
The line I plotted runs here, through Crooked Man Keys.

44:42.200 --> 44:45.120
Cutthroat can't be far off. Look at the chart.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.880
''Reef and coral heads.''

44:48.920 --> 44:51.200
Dawg outguns us, yes. He's bigger.

44:51.280 --> 44:53.720
But that means he's heavier, don't it? He draws more water.

44:53.800 --> 44:57.680
We lure him into the keys and run him aground on the coral heads.

44:57.760 --> 45:01.520
We'll kill him there and take his map.

45:07.040 --> 45:10.560
She has a wound. We must get her below to the cabin.

45:24.080 --> 45:25.920
It's festering. That's why.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.040
- Can you take the ball out? - Hard to say.

45:28.120 --> 45:29.960
Best I seal her side with this hot poker.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.320
That's what we always do in such cases.

45:34.520 --> 45:36.400
No offense, gentlemen, but given the circumstances...

45:36.480 --> 45:39.720
don't you think this calls for a professional?

45:41.200 --> 45:42.440
It's all right.

45:42.480 --> 45:46.440
Let him go. He is a doctor.

45:47.880 --> 45:51.840
I'll need surgeon's tools, hot water, sulfur and clean packing.

45:51.920 --> 45:54.560
- Some rum might help her pain. - Aye.

45:58.400 --> 46:00.640
You as well, John.

46:25.240 --> 46:27.120
- You clumsy swab! - Sorry.

46:27.160 --> 46:29.040
I was supposed to torture you.

46:30.320 --> 46:31.360
Sorry.

46:31.440 --> 46:32.960
- Do you see it yet? - Close.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.440
Another minute.

46:40.600 --> 46:44.720
Your father and two uncles each had pieces of the map.

46:44.800 --> 46:47.480
The treasure, it's large, I take it.

46:47.560 --> 46:50.640
Largest ever taken. Spanish gold ship.

46:51.680 --> 46:53.800
Sorry.

46:53.840 --> 46:56.640
And a third uncle, he chases you.

46:56.720 --> 46:58.920
An unusual family.

47:03.120 --> 47:04.200
Success.

47:22.960 --> 47:25.480
I've treated you cruel, haven't I?

47:27.200 --> 47:29.080
You've had a lot on your mind.

47:29.160 --> 47:31.520
And you did help me at the prison.

47:31.600 --> 47:33.280
The tavern.

47:35.840 --> 47:38.520
Let's say, between us, just for argument's sake...

47:38.600 --> 47:40.680
that you have Mordachai's map.

47:40.720 --> 47:42.800
But I don't.

47:42.880 --> 47:46.000
No, I know that, but pretend that you do.

47:46.040 --> 47:48.720
I was willing to go halves with him and his.

47:48.800 --> 47:51.640
I will do the same with you and yours.

47:52.880 --> 47:55.080
You're saying...

47:55.160 --> 47:58.720
that if I show you mine, you'll share yours with me?

48:03.240 --> 48:05.600
Give me the map.

48:07.280 --> 48:09.600
Give me a kiss first.

48:37.200 --> 48:38.600
Sorry.

48:40.120 --> 48:41.520
Map now.

48:42.280 --> 48:44.400
You see, the thing is...

48:44.480 --> 48:46.360
I don't have it.

48:48.160 --> 48:50.720
But that doesn't mean we can't keep talking about it.

48:50.800 --> 48:53.680
Mr. Blair's respects, Captain.

48:53.760 --> 48:56.280
Talk to yourself. Yes, Mr. Bowen?

48:56.360 --> 48:58.840
The Reaper's five miles off and closing.

48:58.920 --> 49:00.560
You should stay down.

49:04.880 --> 49:08.960
Mr. Bowen, see that Mr. Shaw gets a change of clothes.

49:09.040 --> 49:12.440
- He's beginning to stink. - Aye, Captain.

49:25.040 --> 49:26.720
He has it.

49:42.560 --> 49:44.440
She makes for Crooked Man's Passage.

49:44.520 --> 49:47.200
Yes. She hopes to tear up our bottom on the coral.

49:47.280 --> 49:50.560
Looks like we're in for a blow. Shall we attack her now?

49:50.640 --> 49:53.800
No. We'll go around the islands in the dark.

49:53.840 --> 49:56.320
We'll ambush her on the other side at daybreak.

49:56.400 --> 49:59.040
You are clever, Morgan, but I will catch you.

49:59.120 --> 50:02.280
Uncle Dawg will have his day.

50:35.720 --> 50:38.800
First Ainslee's chasing us. Now your uncle is chasing us.

50:38.880 --> 50:42.680
Now, everybody's chasing us. I'm not so happy about this.

50:42.760 --> 50:47.040
I mean, I'm using this piratical stuff to write a best-selling book.

50:47.120 --> 50:49.800
I didn't want to put myself in any physical danger.

50:49.880 --> 50:52.480
Put a stow in that sail, Mr. Blair. We don't want to lose her.

50:52.560 --> 50:55.400
- Break fast the foresail! - Aye, sir!

50:55.440 --> 50:59.440
I cannot see the horizon. There is a storm headed our way from the island.

50:59.520 --> 51:01.360
- We'll hold this course. - Aye.

51:01.440 --> 51:04.880
- Put an extra man on the helm. - Coxswain, up helm!

51:26.160 --> 51:29.160
''May cruel death leave victims immortal.''

51:44.120 --> 51:47.240
M-C-D-L-V-l.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.840
14-56.

51:53.280 --> 51:55.440
1-4-5-6.

51:56.280 --> 51:58.160
Fourteen degrees latitude...

51:58.200 --> 52:00.600
five minutes, six seconds north.

52:01.680 --> 52:03.040
There's nothing there.

52:05.280 --> 52:08.480
No, you were right. It's not on any chart.

52:08.560 --> 52:11.200
Where did you have it hidden?

52:11.280 --> 52:13.960
In the boat, under the seaty thing.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.680
I knew you'd wind up here at some point...

52:16.760 --> 52:19.920
that being the cheese and you being the rat.

52:20.960 --> 52:24.000
The thing is, ma'am, I'm basically a shallow man.

52:27.520 --> 52:29.720
And no doctor. Am I wrong?

52:29.800 --> 52:31.800
No, not really.

52:31.880 --> 52:34.000
I'm surprised you let me fiddle with your hip.

52:34.040 --> 52:36.200
And no gentleman either.

52:36.240 --> 52:37.840
I wanted to be.

52:37.920 --> 52:39.960
The thing is, I was born poor.

52:40.040 --> 52:43.480
My only choice was to become a thief and a liar.

52:46.640 --> 52:50.240
Then since you lie so easily and are so shallow...

52:51.920 --> 52:55.000
I shall lie you in a shallow grave.

52:55.080 --> 52:56.280
Mr. Blair!

52:56.360 --> 52:58.440
Have you no charity, ma'am?

52:58.520 --> 53:01.000
I brim with charity, Mr. Shaw.

53:01.080 --> 53:02.960
I am charity's very soul.

53:04.760 --> 53:08.880
Success, Mr. Blair. My slave has found Cutthroat Island.

53:08.960 --> 53:11.880
Mark it on the chart.

53:14.400 --> 53:16.320
And since I am so charitable...

53:16.400 --> 53:19.400
I will maroon you on a rock the size of this table...

53:19.440 --> 53:22.760
instead of splattering your brains across my bulkhead,
as you deserve.

53:23.640 --> 53:25.680
Let's take him below.

53:26.720 --> 53:28.120
Pull!

53:30.520 --> 53:31.960
Going up!

53:38.400 --> 53:40.840
Pull the line, mate! Tie it down!

53:40.920 --> 53:42.280
Aye, aye, sir!

53:54.040 --> 53:55.920
Tie it off!

54:52.560 --> 54:54.760
Batten down the hatches!

54:57.720 --> 54:58.920
Hold on!

55:03.000 --> 55:05.600
I found it, Mr. Glasspoole! I've fixed the island.

55:05.680 --> 55:08.680
I know where it is. It lies through the storm.

55:08.720 --> 55:10.640
You risk the ship if you head for it.

55:10.720 --> 55:14.760
I risk Dawg if I turn back. Shorten sail all you want, Mr. Blair.

55:14.840 --> 55:16.840
We head straight through it.

55:21.560 --> 55:23.280
Hold your course, men!

55:31.240 --> 55:33.280
Have you ever seen anything like this?

55:33.360 --> 55:34.920
Not so I'd remember.

55:41.400 --> 55:44.240
I won't run! Look how close we are!

55:59.560 --> 56:02.600
The rig, Morgan! It can't take it!

56:02.640 --> 56:05.680
It can ! We've been through worse with Harry.

56:05.760 --> 56:08.640
Have faith, Mr. Blair! Trust the ship!

56:15.360 --> 56:16.840
We'll try it.

56:28.800 --> 56:30.160
What is this?

56:31.280 --> 56:34.120
I'll not die in a storm for your pleasure.

56:36.680 --> 56:39.720
There are too many of them!

56:43.520 --> 56:46.960
Tom Scully, there's no great love between us, but don't do this.

56:47.040 --> 56:49.440
Not this close. Look! There's the island!

56:50.440 --> 56:52.960
It can't be more than two or three leagues off.

57:12.320 --> 57:13.720
Away the longboat.

57:20.760 --> 57:22.160
Clear the sweep!

57:23.240 --> 57:25.280
Give us a compass, Scully!

57:25.360 --> 57:29.000
You'll have no need of a compass where you're going!

57:29.040 --> 57:31.840
You're going nowhere but down!

57:58.520 --> 57:59.920
Pull!

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Put your backs into it!

58:06.160 --> 58:08.200
Take up the stroke!

58:08.280 --> 58:11.400
Somebody grab that bastard!

58:11.480 --> 58:14.640
No! Parkins! Stop him!

58:20.960 --> 58:23.000
Row hard! It's our one hope!

58:23.080 --> 58:25.400
Put your backs into it, men!

58:34.000 --> 58:36.280
Pull!

58:36.360 --> 58:37.800
Row hard, men!

58:47.560 --> 58:49.320
Reef, men! Reef!

58:49.360 --> 58:51.360
White water ahead!

58:55.120 --> 58:56.600
Row, men, row!

59:12.080 --> 59:14.360
Bowen! Bowen!

59:50.320 --> 59:53.120
- Glasspoole, are you all right? - Aye, Morgan.

59:54.320 --> 59:56.080
- Bowen? - Yes.

59:56.160 --> 59:57.520
- Blair? - Aye.

59:58.960 --> 01:00:00.800
We've lost Hewitt and Ames.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.800
Look! Look!

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:16.680
The cliffs of blood! It's Cutthroat! It must be!

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.000
We are truly blessed.

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:22.640
We made it, Scully!

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.600
- We found it! - We made it!

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.880
We found Cutthroat Island!

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.440
We need to find this trail.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:57.440
- Can you tell where it begins? - Not without the third piece.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:00.680
We'll make for the high ground, get our bearings.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.920
Mr. Bowen, bring that lizard. We'll have it for dinner.

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:04.680
Gentlemen, we must thank Mr. Scully...

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.840
for bringing us the chart.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:11.680
But this piece is the only piece of the map...

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.680
that shows the treasure site.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.360
My piece.

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.760
- The Reaper. - And the Morning Star.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.560
She still swims.

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:29.200
Dawg must've caught Scully when he bore up in the storm.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.960
That scoundrel must've made a deal with Dawg.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.920
He betrayed my crew. No sign of Shaw.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:43.560
Spread out. Search the whole island.

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:47.280
Find me this cove, these cliffs.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.000
I'll wait ashore.

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.600
Go!

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:56.080
He makes to go ashore.

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:01.160
We'll follow him, get the map and find the treasure.

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:06.680
Find me a suitable campsite.

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.600
- I'm grateful to you, Mr. Scully. - My pleasure.

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:18.400
But if you ever are disloyal to me the way you were to Morgan...

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.240
it'll be my pleasure...

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.360
to cook you alive and eat you.

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:24.760
Now get out of my eyes.

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:55.440
Morgan's here!

01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.720
Bitch stole my map!

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:03.040
Find her, or you're all dead!

01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:20.360
Spread out. If he makes it out, we'll grab him.

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:02.480
I know you're out there, Morgan. I can smell you.

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:33.520
Where are you? Damn you.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.080
- Where? - Help.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.520
There he is.

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:45.000
Wait. You wanna be careful. It's quicksand.

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.760
Did you get Dawg's map, you bastard?

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:54.320
Hand it over, or you're a dead man.

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.720
Did you ever think that I might've taken it to give to you?

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:00.160
Not for a second.

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.560
Sinking up to your waist, and still all you can do is lie.

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:05.960
It's completely true. I could no longer stand your opinion of me.

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:09.560
- Then give it over. - I will, with all my heart...

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:11.880
if you'd get me out first.

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:14.240
Do you think I was born last Wednesday?

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.960
Give it here, and then we will talk about rescue.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
I see your point of view...

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:23.280
but it works better for me if I'm on hard land first.

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.880
You're up to your chest.

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.480
What if I give it to you and you leave me here?

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:40.520
You spoke not long ago of marooning me.

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:43.040
What if I pull you out and you swallow it or run away?

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:44.840
You're beyond trusting.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.320
That's the problem with being a thief.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.400
Nobody knows when you're telling the truth.

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:58.000
Give me the tip of your dagger.

01:07:58.080 --> 01:07:59.560
What for?

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:02.320
Give it to me. Don't argue.

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:07.200
There.

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:10.400
It's no Valentine, but it will have to do.

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:14.440
Now you have it all and I have nothing.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:17.120
I'm in your command, Morgan.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.720
Do with me what you will.

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:22.279
Quickly.

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.200
Well...

01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:29.760
good luck.

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:37.200
Fish him out.

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.840
Hold tight.

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:52.520
That was quite a storm, wasn't it, boys?

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.520
We need to get around these hills...

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:21.640
through this forest near the coast.

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:23.240
There.

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.760
There's our treasure.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:28.359
Well, shall we?

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:55.600
What are the instructions from here?

01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:57.800
Seventy-five paces from this pillar.

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.600
- Twelve. - Twelve?

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:03.440
- Thirteen. - Thirteen?

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:05.360
Fourteen.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.360
Fifteen.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.560
Sixteen.

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.320
Seventeen.

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:13.200
Eighteen.

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:14.920
Nineteen.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.720
- Twenty. - Look!

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.960
- Seventy-five? - That's what the map says.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.920
- Well, you misread it. - No, it's very clear.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.960
''Seventy-five paces from the rock pillar.''

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:36.560
- Then the other 55 are out there. - Or...

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:00.600
Look!

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.320
That could be the other 55 paces.

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:07.280
We found a cave in the cliff!

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.320
Aye!

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:44.960
If they catch us here, they'll find Morgan.

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.320
We must leave.

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.920
Dead men tell no tales.

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:11.080
What does it say?

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:16.560
''Mouth of darkness, teeth of stone...

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.880
down the throat to the belly of gold...

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.280
guarded by those who never grew old.''

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:26.280
Well.

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:28.240
Watch your head here.

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.080
Here.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.280
Don't do that!

01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:08.880
Let's try this way.

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.440
Uh, but--

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:39.720
Down the throat to the belly of gold!

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.320
Hey!

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:45.200
Down the throat to the belly of gold!

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:02.720
Harry, I found it.

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.960
''Guarded by those who never grew old.''

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.800
And your grandfather was the only one that came back.

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:52.800
We're rich! Rich!

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:57.160
We'd best get these out. Dawg can't be far behind.

01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:00.320
Fetch the others. I'll start hauling this to the entrance.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.320
Right.

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:03.840
Wait.

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:10.080
All right. I'm going. But no tricks. And hurry.

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:10.640
Anybody up there?

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:30.720
Morgan! Lucky me.

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:34.640
We were lookin' all over for you.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.680
That's your young friend from Spittlefield.

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:56.800
- What have you got there? - Treasure! Bags of it!

01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:59.720
Be careful what you do! You could lose a lot!

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:01.840
Put a ball between his eyes.

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:07.200
Go ahead! It's about four million pounds!

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:08.360
No, wait!

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:11.880
That's a guess, but I can't be off by more than a million pounds.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.160
Cut the rope, William! Get away!

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:18.280
William! Let's make a deal. I can be reasonable.

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.760
Send Morgan down!

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:23.080
I'll send the treasure up, and we'll both have what we want!

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:26.400
All right, William. We have a deal.

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:28.000
Here she comes.

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:45.520
I wish I'd never learned Latin.

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:49.480
Now we have both. Haul them in.

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:51.200
Don't watch me fall.

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:54.720
- I'm coming with you. - Don't be mad. Why?

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:57.800
Don't argue. Let's agree upon something for once.

01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:00.320
All right. On the count of three, then?

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:04.160
Come to me, Morgan.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.720
- One more thing. - What?

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:10.120
Considering everything, I really think that from now on...

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:12.160
we should be full partners.

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:13.480
What do you say?

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:20.560
- Sixty-forty. - Fifty-fifty. Full partners.

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:22.400
Very well.

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:25.000
They have a lot to say to each other, don't they?

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:29.160
- Are you ready now? - Ready.

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:31.760
One.

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:34.400
Two.

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:38.520
Now!

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:51.920
Love.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.560
Who can explain it?

01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:55.320
Come on. Heave!

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:58.000
This is your future, man. Heave!

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:47.640
- Have you seen Morgan? - Yes, I did.

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:50.320
She helped me ashore, then sent me to find you.

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:53.400
Thank God she's alive. Where is she?

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.520
Where Dawg can't find her.

01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:00.000
It's this way. Follow me.

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:06.200
- How'd you get off Morgan's ship? - Same as you, I jumped.

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.280
Fortunately, I'm an excellent swimmer.

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:16.680
- This seems rather far. - It's just a few more feet.

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:18.440
Raise muskets! Aim!

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.120
Splendid.

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:29.760
Before we hang you in Port Royal, you've time to witness...

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:31.360
an historic alliance.

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:36.560
Where's Morgan?

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:39.680
I don't think she made it.

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:45.680
Perhaps you're wondering how I come to be here.

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:47.720
A little bird told me.

01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:51.120
Plump pigeon. Courtesy of Mr. Reed.

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:01.160
All right, get up!

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:03.920
All right, you. Come on!

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:09.480
There, sir!

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:53.200
Trotter!

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:55.520
Discretion dictates that I shall not
load the treasure...

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:57.480
out of the British man-of-war.

01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:00.720
I shall go back to Port Royal with Captain Dawg.

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.800
But, sir--

01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:07.440
You don't have much feel for these things.

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:09.080
One day, perhaps.

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:10.920
I hope so, sir.

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:33.320
That's it! Got it!

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:37.000
Take a few of the men and follow in the other pirate ship.

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:39.920
You'll get a share of the prize money-- a little here, a little there.

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:42.480
- It all adds up. - Yes, sir!

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:45.560
Now, sir, I shall go presently...

01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:48.000
and write for your royal pardon.

01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:49.920
Privateer for the Crown.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.800
Sounds so much better than ''pirate,'' don't you think?

01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:03.360
Why do you let that preening swab live?

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:05.000
I study him.

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.280
When I become governor of Jamaica...

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:10.320
I will need a certain... style.

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:14.240
Trotter.

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:28.640
Lock them below with the others. They hang at Port Royal.

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.960
With pleasure, Your Honor.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.640
- Welcome aboard my ship, gentlemen. - Move along!

01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:36.560
I trust you'll find your quarters to my liking.

01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:44.200
Move on! Below with ya! Let's get down there!

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:47.280
We'll weigh anchor. Rouse the watch forward.

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:16.440
There we go.

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.520
Square away the breakers!

01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:23.480
- Stand by! - Come on now.

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:25.400
Push!

01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:26.880
Let go the footing!

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:54.160
I thought I should never see you again.

01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:56.680
Yes, Mr. Glasspoole, it's me.

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:59.440
What do you say? Shall we take back our ship?

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:01.040
On your word, Captain.

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:05.800
Tackle's all right. Cover it up.

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.880
The next one.

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:09.920
Mr. Coller!

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.640
I believe we can ease the main sheet a foot or two.

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:15.520
- Aye, sir! - It'll draw better for it.

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:17.640
Are you a good swimmer, Mr. Scully?

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:31.560
Let's find out, shall we?

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:41.080
Do you wish a compass, Scully?

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:44.640
Take your closest friends with you! There are islands close by!

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:46.880
You can make it if you swim slowly!

01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:48.800
I'll get you!

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:53.000
I'll be back, Morgan, if it's the last thing I do!

01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.000
King Charles?

01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.720
Ease your topsail!

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:06.560
Are you in there?

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:16.920
Well, you've seen what another captain's like.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.880
Will you take my orders now?

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:24.520
Smile, Mr. Trotter.

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:30.680
Good, Trotter.

01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:40.960
Give me some more shot here.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.120
We'll edge towards them, Mr. Blair.

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.160
Not so fast to alarm them.

01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:51.960
Two points to starboard, and keep her steady.

01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:54.360
Two points starboard. Keep her steady.

01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:12.880
Trotter's closing on us.

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:14.440
Is that so?

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:17.720
Doubtless wants advice.

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:20.160
Poor fool can't tie his shoelaces without instruction.

01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:22.760
Let's let him catch us.

01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:33.160
I hope Mr. Shaw's still alive.

01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:51.840
General quarters, Mr. Snelgrave.

01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:54.960
Powder to the guns, but softly.

01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:56.480
What's going on?

01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:58.400
Do what I tell you.

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:01.800
Governor. Oblige me.

01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:06.920
Let me hang Mr. Shaw now from my yardarm.

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:10.880
- This minute? - Yes.

01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:12.360
Might be rather amusing.

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.920
One doesn't often get the chance to see a hanging at sea.

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:24.240
Come on, you.

01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:35.240
Present arms!

01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:51.680
It
