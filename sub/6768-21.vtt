00:03.002 --> 00:04.587
ATTORNEY KAY:
<i>So, when you came to,</i>

00:04.671 --> 00:06.423
{\an1}you realized you'd
been drugged.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.341
{\an1}Correct?
Yes.

00:08.425 --> 00:11.052
Beverly Hills police
confirmed positive

00:11.136 --> 00:12.595
for Rohypnol in your blood.

00:12.679 --> 00:13.763
That's right.

00:13.847 --> 00:18.017
Rohypnol-- isn't that what's
known as the date rape drug?

00:18.101 --> 00:18.935
Yes, it is.

00:19.018 --> 00:23.231
So, in slang terms,
you'd been roofed.

00:23.314 --> 00:24.983
{\an3}The drug had been
slipped into your drink.

00:25.066 --> 00:26.401
Yes.

00:26.484 --> 00:28.445
{\an3}Well, how did this
make you feel?

00:28.528 --> 00:30.113
Um... woozy?

00:30.196 --> 00:32.824
I was completely disoriented.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.786
So, tell us, Ms. Malone,

00:36.870 --> 00:38.747
after the Rohypnol wore off,

00:38.830 --> 00:42.500
how did you become aware

00:42.584 --> 00:44.002
that you had been raped?

00:44.085 --> 00:46.337
{\an3}Objection!
I'll rephrase.

00:46.421 --> 00:47.213
Go on.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.257
{\an1}When you came to
in Noah Hunter's office,

00:49.340 --> 00:51.468
were your clothes on

00:51.551 --> 00:53.887
{\an1}or off?
They were off.

00:53.970 --> 00:56.014
And who was next to you
getting dressed?

00:56.097 --> 00:57.599
Noah Hunter.

00:57.682 --> 01:00.769
{\an6}Is he here in this
courtroom today?
Yes, he is.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.395
Would you point him out
to us, please?

01:05.063 --> 01:07.066
And the person who admitted

01:07.150 --> 01:08.651
{\an1}to having sex
with you that night,

01:08.735 --> 01:10.487
is he here in the
courtroom today?

01:10.570 --> 01:11.488
{\an3}VALERIE:
Yes.

01:11.571 --> 01:12.822
Would you identify him, please?

01:12.906 --> 01:15.408
The defendant, Noah Hunter.

01:17.994 --> 01:20.705
No further questions.

01:22.415 --> 01:23.583
Miss Evans, your witness.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.509
Miss Malone,

01:32.592 --> 01:34.177
have you ever faked a pregnancy?

01:34.260 --> 01:37.013
{\an1}Objection!
Argumentative.

01:37.096 --> 01:38.181
Overruled.

01:38.264 --> 01:39.682
Have you, Miss Malone?

01:41.643 --> 01:44.562
Well, uh, once, sort of.

01:44.646 --> 01:46.314
"Once, sort of."

01:46.397 --> 01:48.650
And this fake pregnancy,

01:48.733 --> 01:49.984
wasn't it part of

01:50.068 --> 01:51.694
a failed blackmail scheme?

01:52.737 --> 01:54.697
Yes.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.866
To get money from a man with
whom you were having an affair?

01:56.950 --> 01:58.034
Yes.

01:58.117 --> 02:00.495
And weren't you also arrested

02:00.578 --> 02:02.664
"once, sort of" for bookmaking?

02:02.747 --> 02:04.165
Yes.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.708
And wasn't this also a scheme

02:05.792 --> 02:07.377
to gain money
through illegal means?

02:07.460 --> 02:08.711
Yes.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.380
{\an3}EVANS:
I see.

02:10.463 --> 02:11.673
{\an3}Tell me,
Miss Malone,

02:11.756 --> 02:14.133
were you and Mr. Hunter
ever lovers?

02:16.803 --> 02:18.555
For a short time.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.765
{\an1}You were in love
with him, correct?

02:25.353 --> 02:27.605
Maybe... yes.

02:28.857 --> 02:31.526
{\an6}EVANS:
Is that why you
struck Mr. Hunter?

02:31.609 --> 02:32.318
Pardon me?

02:32.402 --> 02:34.779
After Mr. Hunter
broke up with you,

02:34.863 --> 02:36.114
you slapped him
across the face.

02:36.197 --> 02:38.283
{\an1}Why?
Well, he lied to me.

02:38.366 --> 02:40.243
He lied to you?

02:40.326 --> 02:42.996
About what?

02:43.079 --> 02:47.292
Well, he told me he was broke
and I found out he had money.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.752
I see.
So, that angered you.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.754
Yes.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.089
EVANS: But while you
were still together

02:53.173 --> 02:54.799
{\an3}and you thought
Mr. Hunter had no money,

02:54.883 --> 02:56.801
you cheated on him
with a rich man--

02:56.885 --> 02:58.761
a Cooper Hargrove.

02:58.845 --> 03:03.725
{\an3}Well, yes... but I-I only
saw Cooper a few times.

03:03.808 --> 03:05.935
But when Mr. Hunter
learned about the liaison,

03:06.019 --> 03:07.270
what happened?

03:07.353 --> 03:08.730
He broke up with me.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.481
So, as you said,

03:10.565 --> 03:12.066
{\an1}shortly thereafter
you found out

03:12.150 --> 03:14.777
{\an1}Mr. Hunter was rich
and that angered you.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.113
In fact, weren't you
furious, Miss Malone?

03:17.196 --> 03:19.115
No.

03:19.198 --> 03:21.910
That you had once again missed
your chance at the big score?

03:21.993 --> 03:23.828
Objection! Argumentative.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.997
Just like you missed your chance
with the faked pregnancy.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.624
Just like you had
missed your chance

03:27.707 --> 03:28.917
when you were arrested
for bookmaking.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.001
{\an4}No!
JUDGE:
Miss Evans!

03:30.084 --> 03:32.420
She won't even let her finish!

03:32.503 --> 03:33.755
Isn't that why you consented

03:33.838 --> 03:36.257
{\an1}to have sex with
Mr. Hunter that night?

03:36.341 --> 03:39.135
Because he had spurned you,

03:39.218 --> 03:40.470
because you had contrived a way

03:40.553 --> 03:42.263
{\an4}to get back at him?
JUDGE:
Miss Evans,

03:42.347 --> 03:43.723
that is enough.

03:43.806 --> 03:45.433
Because you want revenge.

03:45.516 --> 03:46.768
No, he raped me!

03:46.851 --> 03:48.603
Did he, Miss Malone?

03:49.896 --> 03:51.356
Did he really?

03:59.030 --> 04:01.908
♪ ♪

04:25.056 --> 04:29.102
♪ ♪

04:53.793 --> 04:55.461
♪ ♪

05:43.092 --> 05:45.261
I thought you were keeping
an open mind about this.

05:45.344 --> 05:47.597
I was until Noah's
attorney shut it.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.140
Valerie should've settled.

05:49.223 --> 05:50.600
{\an3}For 200,000
when she thought

05:50.683 --> 05:52.852
{\an3}she could have 10 million?
Not our Val.

05:52.935 --> 05:54.979
I just can't believe
she's doing this for money.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.481
Brandon, didn't you
hear the testimony?

05:56.564 --> 05:57.774
The lies, the scams.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.609
Yeah, I heard it and
it's beside the point.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.278
{\an3}Why are you so blind when
it comes to this girl?

06:02.361 --> 06:03.529
This isn't about her.

06:03.613 --> 06:04.530
It's about him.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.074
Last time I checked,

06:06.157 --> 06:07.617
{\an6}Noah was the
one on trial.
Really?

06:07.700 --> 06:08.826
Could've fooled me.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.661
You know, the jury
couldn't stop drooling

06:10.745 --> 06:13.414
{\an1}over Valerie's past.
Valerie's no nun, David.

06:13.498 --> 06:14.957
Her character isn't
the issue here, Steve.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.293
{\an3}Guys, why don't we just
stick to the facts, okay?

06:17.376 --> 06:19.045
{\an4}The DA didn't file
criminal charges.
Because

06:19.128 --> 06:20.797
he couldn't get a conviction,
not because it didn't happen.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.299
Okay, so you're
on Valerie's side.

06:23.382 --> 06:25.301
No, I'm just saying, I think--
Look, Brandon,

06:25.384 --> 06:26.511
in a situation like this,
if you're

06:26.594 --> 06:27.512
not with her,
you're against her.

06:27.595 --> 06:28.846
I don't think so.

06:28.930 --> 06:29.931
I do.

06:30.014 --> 06:31.015
But at least I know

06:31.099 --> 06:32.141
what side you're on now.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.601
Don't twist what I said, Val.

06:33.684 --> 06:35.603
{\an3}Why? Everybody's
mangling what I say.

06:36.562 --> 06:37.605
Okay.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.485
You know what? He has always
been there for you.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.278
He's the one who defends you.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.656
More than I can say
for the rest of you guys.

06:46.739 --> 06:47.907
But it's not enough.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.009
{\an3}Hey, come on, don't let her
get to you, all right?

07:07.093 --> 07:09.137
{\an1}So, what do you think,
is the jury with me?

07:09.220 --> 07:10.096
What, are you kidding?

07:10.179 --> 07:11.973
{\an3}After the way your attorney
carved her up?

07:12.056 --> 07:13.808
{\an3}No question.
Let's go.

07:19.355 --> 07:21.482
These painkillers--
aren't you overdoing it?

07:21.566 --> 07:22.483
My back's killing me.

07:22.567 --> 07:23.568
Besides,
they're not painkillers.

07:23.651 --> 07:26.821
{\an3}Yeah, I gave Donna a couple
of my D-amphetamines.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.322
{\an3}One time, man.
No big deal.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.992
No big deal, huh?
These are prescription drugs.

07:31.075 --> 07:33.911
{\an6}I took a couple uppers
to stay awake, okay?
Look, I know.

07:33.995 --> 07:35.746
I'm just saying,
even with the pressures at work,

07:35.830 --> 07:36.789
you gotta go easy.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.208
Did I ask for your advice or...?

07:39.292 --> 07:41.210
{\an3}Okay...
I'll tell you what,

07:41.294 --> 07:42.795
{\an3}I'll catch you later,
huh, Noah?

07:44.922 --> 07:46.674
Look, I know the trial's
upsetting you.

07:46.757 --> 07:47.842
And your concern,

07:47.925 --> 07:49.719
it really is very touching.

07:49.802 --> 07:50.803
{\an1}But if you think
I'm gonna sit

07:50.887 --> 07:52.889
in there and listen to the trash
they're talking...

07:52.972 --> 07:53.931
Look, I'm not a rapist.

07:54.015 --> 07:55.391
{\an3}And there's no other
way to prove it.

07:55.474 --> 07:56.559
Your lawyers

07:56.642 --> 07:59.437
are making Valerie out to--
to be some kind of tramp.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.063
She's just trying
to convince the jury

08:01.147 --> 08:02.315
that Valerie's a schemer.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.317
Yes, she is a schemer.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.110
And you slept with her,
didn't you?

08:07.486 --> 08:09.405
Look, I got a job to do.

08:09.488 --> 08:11.073
When court resumes
this afternoon,

08:11.157 --> 08:12.533
don't expect me to be here.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.585
There's gotta be
a way of, like...

08:22.668 --> 08:23.920
{\an3}We gotta rearrange
this whole...

08:24.003 --> 08:25.922
{\an1}If we-- okay,
if we move the bridge--

08:26.005 --> 08:27.256
Um, who's the suit?

08:27.340 --> 08:28.591
{\an3}JASPER:
I have no idea,

08:28.674 --> 08:30.259
{\an3}but I think we're about
to find out.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.844
MAN: Sounds like
a winner, guys.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.136
Frank Saunders.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.388
Q5's senior VP for production.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.182
{\an3}I thought that was
Lola's job.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.808
They haven't told you yet?

08:37.892 --> 08:39.769
{\an1}There's been a bit
of a shake-up.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.102
There's a new team in place now.

08:41.187 --> 08:44.273
{\an1}And let me guess, uh...
she's not on it.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.608
We're going for a new sound.
A new approach.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.443
{\an3}Lola was a big
supporter of ours.

08:47.526 --> 08:49.445
She thought you both were
very talented--

08:49.528 --> 08:50.488
{\an1}yes.

08:50.571 --> 08:51.864
Would you excuse me?

08:51.948 --> 08:53.324
{\an3}I'm gonna give
her a call.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.326
Absolutely.

08:55.409 --> 08:58.329
Look, um...

08:58.412 --> 08:59.997
this new sound...

09:00.081 --> 09:01.165
Don't worry, David--

09:01.249 --> 09:03.584
the new sound, it's yours.

09:03.668 --> 09:04.669
It is?

09:04.752 --> 09:05.795
Great, okay.

09:05.878 --> 09:06.963
Great, I mean,

09:07.046 --> 09:09.465
{\an4}this is huge opportunity
for us, you know...
David, David--

09:09.548 --> 09:12.301
I'm sorry, it's-it's
<i>your</i> sound, David.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.136
It's not Jasper's.

09:15.179 --> 09:16.681
Um...

09:18.224 --> 09:20.559
...the name of the band is
Jasper's Law.

09:20.643 --> 09:21.602
{\an1}Maybe.

09:21.686 --> 09:24.146
But the guy we're
interested in...

09:24.230 --> 09:25.231
is you.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.156
GWINNET:
<i>The good news is</i>

09:34.240 --> 09:36.826
Remmington loves Donna's
Child's Play collection.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.995
{\an3}They've committed to
some big numbers.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.163
{\an1}They've got the whole crew
working nonstop

09:41.247 --> 09:43.291
to fill the order.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.669
You feeling all right,
Donna?

09:46.752 --> 09:48.671
{\an1}No residual back pain
from the accident?

09:48.754 --> 09:50.673
{\an1}Oh, tell me
about back pain.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.508
No, I'm fine. Why?

09:52.591 --> 09:54.844
{\an3}I just noticed the way you
eased into the chair.

09:54.927 --> 09:57.680
Oh, well, I didn't want
to spill my coffee.

09:57.763 --> 09:58.723
{\an1}Anyway,
the bad news

09:58.806 --> 10:01.517
is that Remmington wants
to do another gig with us.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.853
{\an1}Bad news?
Yeah,

10:03.936 --> 10:05.521
they need the prelims
day after tomorrow.

10:05.604 --> 10:07.982
{\an1}What?
That gives us no time.

10:08.065 --> 10:09.150
What kind of line
are we talking about?

10:09.233 --> 10:10.359
Kids' sleepwear.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.861
Uh, fleece nighties,

10:11.944 --> 10:13.070
{\an3}one-piece pajamas,
the whole deal.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.114
Look, if your back
is killing you...

10:15.197 --> 10:17.074
(chuckles)

10:17.158 --> 10:19.910
Why is everyone
so concerned about...

10:21.120 --> 10:22.163
Excuse me.

10:22.246 --> 10:23.706
(clears throat)
Anyway,

10:23.789 --> 10:25.374
Remmington's turning
into a real cash cow

10:25.458 --> 10:26.792
{\an1}for us.

10:26.876 --> 10:27.752
{\an3}The clock's gonna
be ticking,

10:27.835 --> 10:29.712
pressure'll be on.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.756
No problem. I'm on top of it.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.049
Danielle?

10:33.132 --> 10:34.091
{\an3}I said

10:34.175 --> 10:35.509
that I'll handle it.

10:35.593 --> 10:36.677
Okay.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.512
It's your call.

10:38.596 --> 10:39.722
{\an3}I'm gonna need
sketches

10:39.805 --> 10:40.931
in 36 hours.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.975
{\an1}Any other

10:43.059 --> 10:44.518
{\an3}business?

10:44.602 --> 10:45.770
{\an1}Good.

10:45.853 --> 10:47.897
I'm starving.

11:00.701 --> 11:03.079
Yeah, Josh Hunter.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.914
Josh, hey, it's Donna.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.791
Listen, you-you mentioned
before that

11:06.874 --> 11:08.167
you had some painkillers also?

11:08.250 --> 11:10.795
And, uh, my prescription
just ran out,

11:10.878 --> 11:11.962
and I thought...
Donna, look,

11:12.046 --> 11:15.091
I told you like five phone calls
ago, I am not a pharmacy.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.843
Look, I'm on the other line.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.595
You think maybe
I could get back to you?

11:19.678 --> 11:22.640
Yeah, um, you know, I thought
maybe you could just

11:22.723 --> 11:24.600
give me something to get
over the hump, you know?

11:24.683 --> 11:27.436
I am really, really
not comfortable

11:27.520 --> 11:28.479
about this conversation.

11:28.562 --> 11:30.272
Come on, Josh.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.775
Feels like my filling's
are gonna scream here, okay?

11:32.858 --> 11:35.319
Donna, look, my other
phone call, it's about Noah.

11:35.403 --> 11:36.404
Do you remember him?

11:36.487 --> 11:37.405
He's your boyfriend?

11:37.488 --> 11:39.573
I can meet you at the
courthouse, if you want.

11:39.657 --> 11:42.576
Yeah, well, I'm kinda focused
on the trial right now.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.954
Maybe you should be, too.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.914
(dial tone)

11:52.211 --> 11:53.254
{\an1}David.
Hey.

11:53.337 --> 11:54.463
Hey. How are you?

11:54.547 --> 11:56.966
{\an3}You know, it's funny--
I meant to tell you.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.634
You look really familiar.

11:58.717 --> 11:59.635
Like I've met you before.

11:59.718 --> 12:02.430
{\an1}Yeah. I was in promotions
before heads rolled.

12:02.513 --> 12:05.599
{\an1}I had a lot to do with
getting your song airplay.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.643
And I do mean your song.

12:08.686 --> 12:11.313
Well, uh, Jasper
and I are a team.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.858
He's pulling you down.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.736
Um, I don't think so.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.989
Hey, like you said,
I'm new on the job.

12:20.072 --> 12:23.159
{\an1}Maybe I should take
a second listen.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.326
That song
you were playing earlier--

12:24.410 --> 12:25.327
could I hear it again?

12:25.411 --> 12:27.329
Yeah, sure,

12:27.413 --> 12:29.331
{\an3}as soon as Jasper
gets here.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.666
Of course.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.501
Thing is, I have
got this meeting

12:32.585 --> 12:34.003
that I've gotta get to and...

12:34.086 --> 12:35.504
Really.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.839
Hey, look, David,

12:36.922 --> 12:39.383
{\an3}I said I would give Jasper
his due and I will.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.010
Now, how about it?
Come on.

12:41.093 --> 12:43.220
One song?

12:43.304 --> 12:44.763
For my ears only.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.309
Fine.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.811
{\an3}But then we wait.
Hey,

12:50.895 --> 12:52.897
{\an3}you're the star, okay?
Okay.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.952
Record this on DAT for me.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.834
Excuse me. Hello?

13:13.918 --> 13:14.877
Excuse me.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.170
{\an1}I'm sorry, miss,
we're closed.

13:16.253 --> 13:17.505
No, you don't understand.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.006
I need my prescription refilled.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.513
No allowance here for refills.

13:25.596 --> 13:27.014
What do you mean, no allowance?

13:27.097 --> 13:29.266
I'll need Dr. Martin's
signature.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.518
He's away.

13:30.601 --> 13:31.602
I-I can't get his signature.

13:31.685 --> 13:34.063
{\an3}He's away...
Wait, that's it?!

13:34.146 --> 13:34.855
You can't just leave!

13:34.939 --> 13:36.398
{\an1}I need my prescription
refilled now.

13:36.482 --> 13:37.942
{\an3}Please!
Miss...

13:38.025 --> 13:40.027
{\an3}Miss, your prescription was
to last you two weeks.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.154
You've gone through 60 pills
in less than one.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.114
{\an1}Yes, I-I was
in an accident

13:44.198 --> 13:45.115
and I hurt my back.

13:45.199 --> 13:46.242
My hands are tied.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.451
Now if you'll excuse me,

13:47.535 --> 13:48.744
I'm late for my daughter's
birthday.

13:48.827 --> 13:50.246
Wait, I'm in pain!

13:50.329 --> 13:52.373
I'm... in pain!

14:03.133 --> 14:04.635
VALERIE:
<i>You're kidding me!</i>

14:04.718 --> 14:05.594
Noah's calling you

14:05.678 --> 14:07.054
(detector beeping)
as a character witness?

14:07.137 --> 14:08.389
Sir.
On his behalf?

14:08.472 --> 14:09.807
{\an1}I mean, I know everybody
was subpoenaed,

14:09.890 --> 14:10.808
but this is ridiculous.

14:10.891 --> 14:12.101
Yeah, and if you
think about it,

14:12.184 --> 14:13.060
{\an3}it's the smart
thing to do.

14:13.143 --> 14:14.937
{\an3}Look, Val, if I say anything
bad about Noah,

14:15.020 --> 14:16.480
his lawyer's gonna
point out the fact

14:16.564 --> 14:18.315
{\an6}that you and I
are together.
So?

14:18.399 --> 14:20.317
{\an3}So, I'm your
boyfriend.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.694
Anything negative
I say about Noah

14:21.777 --> 14:23.654
is gonna be immediately
discredited by the jury.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.322
(chuckles)

14:25.406 --> 14:26.782
{\an4}Oh, so what, you think
this is funny?
No.

14:26.865 --> 14:27.950
{\an1}You think this is
amusing, David?

14:28.033 --> 14:29.952
{\an6}No, it frustrates the
hell out of me.
Okay, Val?

14:30.035 --> 14:32.788
Look, with Noah, I'm being asked
to help someone who hurt me,

14:32.871 --> 14:34.331
and with Jasper,
I'm being set up

14:34.415 --> 14:36.000
to hurt someone who helped me.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.167
Oh, that's very poignant.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.502
Very reflective, David.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.004
{\an4}You know what?
Cool off.
No, you know what?

14:40.087 --> 14:41.255
I'm not gonna cool off.

14:41.338 --> 14:44.049
I want to clear my name.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.138
{\an1}Kel?
Hi.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.140
{\an1}Hey, uh,
is my dad around?

14:51.223 --> 14:53.601
Yeah, yeah, you
look exhausted.

14:53.684 --> 14:55.144
Thanks.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.021
{\an1}Did you just come from court?
No,

14:57.104 --> 14:58.480
I'm-I'm not going back.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.482
Besides I-I have a deadline
at work.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.401
Is there anything I can do?

15:02.484 --> 15:03.861
No, it's just...

15:03.944 --> 15:05.654
my back's still completely
out of whack.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.114
I really need

15:07.197 --> 15:08.324
to see my dad now...

15:08.407 --> 15:09.325
{\an3}Okay.

15:09.408 --> 15:10.451
{\an3}I'll go see if he's
almost done.

15:10.534 --> 15:12.536
Thanks.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.957
(knocking)

15:17.041 --> 15:18.959
Hey, Dr. Martin.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.794
{\an3}Uh...

15:35.100 --> 15:36.185
Hi, sweetheart.

15:37.478 --> 15:38.937
How you feeling?

15:39.021 --> 15:41.815
Dad, uh, pretty bad, actually.

15:41.899 --> 15:43.984
Is it your back?

15:44.068 --> 15:46.904
{\an3}Yeah, I-I did what-what
the neurologist said,

15:46.987 --> 15:48.197
I've done
what the orthopedist said...

15:48.280 --> 15:50.866
Honey,
they recommended bed rest.

15:50.949 --> 15:53.702
I'm under a lot of pressure
at work right now.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.079
{\an1}Work's just gonna
have to wait.

15:55.162 --> 15:57.456
It can't wait.

16:00.959 --> 16:03.837
I have, like,
eight million sketches

16:03.921 --> 16:05.839
that are due tomorrow;

16:05.923 --> 16:08.217
{\an3}I have a boss that is
depending on me;

16:08.300 --> 16:11.011
and I can't get any of it done
because my back is in spasms

16:11.095 --> 16:12.721
and I am completely
out of pain pills.

16:13.764 --> 16:15.599
What happened to the pills

16:15.683 --> 16:17.351
that I prescribed
for you last week?

16:17.434 --> 16:20.020
I was taking them
in the kitchen,

16:20.104 --> 16:21.605
{\an3}I knocked the
bottle over

16:21.689 --> 16:23.357
and I spilled them all
down the drain.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.027
Dad, hello?

16:27.111 --> 16:28.696
It's me.

16:28.779 --> 16:29.863
{\an1}I'm in pain and I need help.
All right.

16:29.947 --> 16:33.117
Okay. How about if I give you
enough pills to last you

16:33.200 --> 16:34.451
a few days,
all right?

16:34.535 --> 16:36.578
{\an3}Then...

16:38.872 --> 16:41.917
...you'll take just
four per day, okay?

16:45.045 --> 16:47.256
{\an3}So, you haven't said
anything about the trial.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.299
It's all kind of a mess
right now.

16:49.383 --> 16:52.094
Uh, well, I-I think it's very
smart for you to stay away.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.138
{\an3}Thanks for the refill.
Yeah.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.682
Sure.
Donna... Well, if...

16:56.765 --> 16:58.851
if you're still having pain
when you're done with those,

16:58.934 --> 17:01.979
then I want
to see you again, okay?

17:02.062 --> 17:03.647
Go, go, go. Be brilliant.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.760
EVANS:
<i>And isn't it true</i>

17:32.843 --> 17:34.636
that Noah Hunter bailed you out
with a loan shark?

17:34.720 --> 17:36.972
Yeah.

17:37.055 --> 17:38.974
{\an3}And later he bought the
building you rent

17:39.057 --> 17:41.185
space in to keep you
from being evicted?

17:43.604 --> 17:44.980
Yes.

17:45.063 --> 17:46.690
So you'd been

17:46.774 --> 17:50.235
{\an1}shot and needed a rare AB
negative blood transfusion.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.196
{\an1}What exactly did
Mr. Hunter do?

17:52.279 --> 17:55.824
He donated his own
AB negative blood.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.826
He helped save my life.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.495
So, after tumbling

17:59.578 --> 18:01.830
down the hillside,
Mr. Silver found himself

18:01.914 --> 18:03.332
unable to swim out of the river?

18:03.415 --> 18:05.459
{\an1}Yes.
And you

18:05.542 --> 18:06.835
and Mr. Hunter pulled him

18:06.919 --> 18:08.212
{\an1}to safety?

18:08.295 --> 18:09.046
Yeah.

18:09.129 --> 18:12.007
{\an1}So, you and Mr. Hunter
saved his life?

18:12.090 --> 18:14.551
Yeah.

18:40.744 --> 18:42.329
Wow, great stuff.

18:43.330 --> 18:45.165
Come on, you're
just saying that.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.167
No, really.

18:47.251 --> 18:48.252
Has anyone seen these?

18:49.628 --> 18:51.547
{\an3}It was just something
I was fooling with

18:51.630 --> 18:53.090
{\an3}for this job
interview

18:53.173 --> 18:54.341
I've got later on.

18:54.424 --> 18:56.343
Um, they're just
doodles, really.

18:56.426 --> 18:58.428
Another time maybe?

19:01.265 --> 19:03.433
Yeah, some other time.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.232
Donna, don't mean to
put on the pressure,

19:10.315 --> 19:12.025
{\an3}but I'm putting on
the pressure.

19:12.109 --> 19:14.027
{\an3}How's my sleepwear?
Uh, fine.

19:14.111 --> 19:17.114
Your, uh, your sketches
will be ready tomorrow.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.916
♪ Don't know how
to say good-bye ♪

19:28.000 --> 19:32.754
♪ Don't know how to keep her
satisfied... ♪

19:32.838 --> 19:35.757
{\an3}So, uh, did you
talk to him?

19:35.841 --> 19:38.427
Yeah, I did.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.428
And...?

19:39.511 --> 19:40.971
The blunt truth?

19:41.054 --> 19:44.057
Jasper went nuts,
threw a tantrum, then quit.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.058
Quit?

19:45.142 --> 19:46.059
Yeah.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.728
(scoffs)

19:47.811 --> 19:49.229
No way.

19:50.397 --> 19:53.358
Wha-- the-the band is his life.

19:53.442 --> 19:54.985
I mean, if-if he walks,
they'll walk.

19:55.068 --> 19:58.655
David, don't you see
how they look at you?

19:58.739 --> 20:00.824
{\an1}How everyone looks
at you?

20:00.908 --> 20:02.451
Nobody's walking anywhere.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.620
You've got it, man.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.622
You are going to be
a very big star.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.624
Yeah...

20:08.707 --> 20:10.959
I mean, Jasper, he...

20:11.043 --> 20:13.086
he stood by me from day one.

20:14.212 --> 20:16.840
Do you think the record trade is
about nice guys?

20:16.924 --> 20:18.133
{\an1}Huh?

20:18.216 --> 20:19.301
It's a business.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.428
Now, Jasper is history,

20:21.511 --> 20:23.472
and you're gonna have to
get over that.

20:23.555 --> 20:26.308
David, opportunities
like this come along

20:26.391 --> 20:27.601
{\an1}but once
in a lifetime.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.311
Now, you have to decide:

20:29.394 --> 20:31.313
either you're here
to be a nice guy

20:31.396 --> 20:34.608
or be on the cover
of <i> Rolling Stone,</i> man.

20:34.691 --> 20:36.068
It's that simple.

20:38.195 --> 20:40.656
{\an3}Hey, this trial
is far from over.

20:40.739 --> 20:43.325
{\an1}And after my so-called
friends' testimony today...

20:43.408 --> 20:44.826
{\an3}Well, there's no
denying it.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.329
{\an3}They got in a few shots
about your character.

20:47.412 --> 20:49.331
{\an1}More like Noah's
a Boy Scout.

20:49.414 --> 20:50.832
Look, the facts
haven't changed.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.334
{\an3}You're still the
victim here, Valerie.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.127
{\an3}You were roofed and
you were raped.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.629
{\an1}And Noah?

20:55.712 --> 20:57.631
{\an3}Oh, well, poor
little rich boy.

20:57.714 --> 20:58.799
{\an3}Got drunk.

20:58.882 --> 21:00.342
Admitted to having sex.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.885
{\an3}Guilty.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.012
Don't worry so much.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.101
{\an3}Go to hell.
I'm already there.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.735
How's it comin'?

21:18.819 --> 21:20.737
{\an1}Good.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.573
Well, you've got the rest
of the night to go crazy.

21:23.657 --> 21:24.992
Hope you score.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.670
What a day.

22:18.754 --> 22:21.131
You can bet Valerie won't be
talking to me anytime soon.

22:21.214 --> 22:22.049
It's a moot point.

22:22.132 --> 22:24.134
{\an1}No matter who wins this case,
we all lose.

22:24.217 --> 22:27.137
If Valerie wins,
Noah's a rapist.

22:27.220 --> 22:30.140
{\an1}Doubt he'd stick
in town after that.

22:30.223 --> 22:31.600
And if Noah wins...?

22:31.683 --> 22:33.602
{\an1}Then Valerie's the one
catching the bus.

22:33.685 --> 22:35.604
{\an3}Ah, and you said there wasn't
a win-win situation.

22:35.687 --> 22:38.273
For once could we not argue
about this,

22:38.356 --> 22:39.775
{\an1}please?
I'm not arguing.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.651
I would just be happy
to see her go.

22:41.735 --> 22:43.987
Kel, we've only been back
together two weeks;

22:44.071 --> 22:45.322
{\an1}this is all
we've talked about.

22:45.405 --> 22:47.240
I'm open to a suggestion.

22:48.241 --> 22:50.285
She's my friend.

22:50.368 --> 22:52.454
And I think she's evil.

22:52.537 --> 22:53.622
Agree to disagree?

22:53.705 --> 22:55.874
Fine.

23:14.684 --> 23:17.145
We're not ready for this,
are we?

23:19.106 --> 23:20.524
No.

23:22.526 --> 23:24.402
Is it just the trial?

23:26.404 --> 23:27.739
I hope so.

23:29.741 --> 23:30.909
But you're not sure.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.665
Maybe you should just go.

23:41.711 --> 23:43.922
Yeah.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.642
♪ She's lonely ♪

23:55.725 --> 23:59.312
♪ Oh, the road is long... ♪

23:59.396 --> 24:01.648
Yeah, I'd, uh,

24:01.731 --> 24:03.692
I'd like to accept this Grammy
and give props

24:03.775 --> 24:06.695
{\an3}to the whole hip-hop nation
for keepin' it real.

24:06.778 --> 24:08.363
{\an3}Word up.

24:10.740 --> 24:12.659
Mick. Hey.

24:12.742 --> 24:14.703
How you doin'? David Silver,
good to meet you.

24:14.786 --> 24:16.997
Oh, huge, huge fan,
are you kidding me?

24:17.080 --> 24:18.874
Yeah, well,
my album went, you know,

24:18.957 --> 24:20.750
a couple times platinum;
it was no big deal.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.335
Oh, Bob Dylan!

24:22.419 --> 24:24.004
{\an3}I know Bob Dylan,
you kidding me?

24:24.087 --> 24:26.089
It's the same era of music,
we did the same thing.

24:26.173 --> 24:28.008
{\an3}You-you've never
met Bob?

24:28.091 --> 24:30.218
Bob, hey, come...

24:34.264 --> 24:36.433
Um...

24:38.185 --> 24:40.437
...I, uh-- I was...

24:40.520 --> 24:43.732
You were just, uh, pretending
to be somebody else?

24:46.193 --> 24:48.778
Do you think maybe I could play?

24:48.862 --> 24:50.822
{\an3}Sure.
Mmm.

24:50.906 --> 24:52.782
(chuckles)

24:52.866 --> 24:55.118
Um... listen,

24:55.202 --> 24:57.120
{\an3}about, uh, about this
whole testimony

24:57.204 --> 24:59.122
{\an3}thing...
David, look...

24:59.206 --> 25:01.124
I know it's not your fault.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.585
I just didn't realize
how much it was gonna hurt,

25:03.668 --> 25:05.170
okay?

25:05.253 --> 25:06.796
So I'll see you later...

25:06.880 --> 25:08.465
Puff Daddy?

25:08.548 --> 25:10.592
{\an6}(playful groan)
Oh, there's somebody
here to see you, too.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.317
Want to play games?

25:27.400 --> 25:29.069
Let's play games.

25:29.152 --> 25:30.445
You sold me out.

25:30.528 --> 25:31.613
No, no...

25:31.696 --> 25:32.656
Jasper, you quit.

25:32.739 --> 25:34.115
My own band?

25:34.199 --> 25:35.242
{\an3}Get real.

25:36.159 --> 25:39.246
Look, Frank told me
the whole thing...

25:39.329 --> 25:40.705
It's not about Frank.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.458
This is about you recording
our material.

25:43.541 --> 25:46.002
{\an6}What?!
Don't even try
and deny it.

25:46.086 --> 25:47.754
{\an3}The suit played
me the tape.

25:50.173 --> 25:52.300
Jasper, he just asked me to sing
the song, all right?

25:52.384 --> 25:53.927
I didn't know

25:54.010 --> 25:55.762
{\an4}he was recording it.
You know, for God's sakes,
I made you.

25:55.845 --> 25:57.097
If it wasn't for me,

25:57.180 --> 25:59.099
you'd still be moppin' Mercedes
at the car wash.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.810
This is business,

26:01.893 --> 26:02.894
{\an1}okay?

26:02.978 --> 26:05.772
That makes it okay
to double-cross your friends?

26:05.855 --> 26:08.316
He keeps selling me
on this whole star thing.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.859
{\an3}No, no!

26:09.943 --> 26:11.861
You're letting him sell you
the star thing.

26:11.945 --> 26:13.613
It's a snow job, David.

26:13.697 --> 26:16.324
{\an3}You can't be stars unless
you pay your dues.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.285
You gotta have the goods
to back it up.

26:18.368 --> 26:20.161
{\an3}You gotta have the
music first.

26:20.245 --> 26:21.329
No music, no band.

26:21.413 --> 26:22.872
And no band, no stars.

26:25.292 --> 26:27.544
(quiet knocking on door)

26:29.879 --> 26:31.840
Look, I'll work it out, okay?

26:31.923 --> 26:33.466
{\an3}Let me work
it out.

26:33.550 --> 26:34.634
{\an3}Yeah.
David Silver?

26:34.718 --> 26:35.969
Yeah.
Today's your lucky day.

26:36.052 --> 26:37.679
{\an3}Q5 Records is giving you
a Porsche for a week.

26:37.762 --> 26:39.180
All you've got to do

26:39.264 --> 26:40.682
{\an3}is sign on the
dotted line,

26:40.765 --> 26:41.891
{\an3}and pick up the car
this afternoon.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.893
You're kidding me.

26:43.977 --> 26:45.687
Do me a favor--

26:45.770 --> 26:47.647
when you crash and burn,
don't call.

26:49.774 --> 26:51.484
Sir, are you
gonna sign?

26:56.740 --> 26:58.658
{\an6}Hi, guys.
Hi.
Hi.

26:58.742 --> 27:00.160
{\an3}Listen, deadline's
approaching.

27:00.243 --> 27:02.203
{\an6}So, I need you to approve
this ad copy.
Okay.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.872
{\an3}And, uh, the Dog Days
spot fell out.

27:03.955 --> 27:05.165
{\an4}(groans)
What about West
Beverly High?

27:05.248 --> 27:06.249
{\an3}The Reunion
Committee's

27:06.333 --> 27:09.336
in for a full page ad every
other week until April.

27:09.419 --> 27:10.670
That's good.

27:10.754 --> 27:11.838
They still want to run
your current pics

27:11.921 --> 27:12.839
against your yearbook photos,

27:12.922 --> 27:16.343
but they need your submissions,
like, yesterday.

27:16.426 --> 27:17.886
{\an3}So, you left this
on your desk.

27:17.969 --> 27:19.554
It's pictures of when
you guys were kids.

27:19.637 --> 27:21.890
Just choose the ones you like
and, um, I'll submit 'em.

27:21.973 --> 27:23.058
{\an1}Great.

27:23.141 --> 27:24.184
{\an1}Just, uh, don't say it
so loud,

27:24.267 --> 27:26.061
{\an1}we don't want anyone to know
who really runs the paper.

27:26.144 --> 27:28.938
Hmm, well, maybe someday
it'll reflect in my paycheck.

27:29.981 --> 27:31.733
Is her contract
up for renewal?

27:31.816 --> 27:33.401
{\an6}We should give
her a raise.
Wha...?

27:33.485 --> 27:34.444
{\an3}VALERIE:
Well, look who it is.

27:34.527 --> 27:36.196
My so-called life.

27:37.197 --> 27:39.115
Valerie,

27:39.199 --> 27:40.784
about yesterday--

27:40.867 --> 27:42.202
{\an3}the lawyers were really
gunning for bear.

27:42.285 --> 27:43.244
{\an3}VALERIE:
Were they?

27:43.328 --> 27:45.747
{\an1}Well, it seems to me,
for every bad thing Noah did,

27:45.830 --> 27:47.082
you countered with
seven good things.

27:47.165 --> 27:49.042
{\an1}We could only
answer questions,

27:49.125 --> 27:50.085
we couldn't
make 'em up.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.419
You know, it's bad enough

27:51.503 --> 27:53.421
that my own boyfriend was
called on Noah's behalf.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.798
{\an1}But I know
what side he's on.

27:54.881 --> 27:56.424
What irks me
is how much

27:56.508 --> 27:57.926
{\an1}you seemed to relish
the opportunity

27:58.009 --> 27:59.552
to make me out
to be a liar.

27:59.636 --> 28:02.097
{\an3}Hey, nobody relished
anything, Valerie.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.765
And you--

28:03.848 --> 28:05.600
{\an3}I've seen some
heartfelt monologues

28:05.683 --> 28:07.769
before, but they're usually
sticking out in bad plays.

28:07.852 --> 28:10.105
I was under oath,
I told the truth.

28:10.188 --> 28:11.272
{\an3}VALERIE:
You know what's funny?

28:11.356 --> 28:12.732
I'm the one
who's usually attacked

28:12.816 --> 28:13.817
for betraying our friendships.

28:15.193 --> 28:16.653
Now, who's betraying whom?

28:28.039 --> 28:30.625
{\an3}I know this must be
very difficult for you.

28:30.708 --> 28:33.169
{\an1}Yes, the, uh, defendant
is my brother.

28:33.253 --> 28:35.505
And you are a key eyewitness

28:35.588 --> 28:37.215
to the events of the night
in question.

28:37.298 --> 28:40.802
In fact, with Mr.
Hunter intoxicated

28:40.885 --> 28:42.554
and Miss Malone drugged,
you may be the only one

28:42.637 --> 28:45.140
{\an3}who knows exactly what
happened that night.

28:45.223 --> 28:46.850
So, I remind you,

28:46.933 --> 28:48.351
you are under oath.

28:52.355 --> 28:54.983
I swore to tell the truth,
that's what you'll get.

28:55.066 --> 28:57.026
Good.
All right, then...

28:57.110 --> 28:59.279
{\an1}(clears throat) ...let's go
back to the beginning.

28:59.362 --> 29:03.116
{\an1}That night-- who was sitting
with you at the bar?

29:03.199 --> 29:06.119
I was sitting with, uh, Val--

29:06.202 --> 29:09.664
er, Miss Malone, and my brother
Noah was behind the bar.

29:09.747 --> 29:13.334
{\an5}KAY:
<i>And Noah is the one who brought</i>
<i>Ms. Malone her drink.</i>

29:13.418 --> 29:14.335
JOSH:
<i>Yes.</i>

29:14.419 --> 29:16.004
Did she drink it right away?

29:16.087 --> 29:17.505
No.

29:17.589 --> 29:21.009
{\an5}KAY:
<i>Did you see Noah</i>
<i>handle the drink?</i>

29:21.092 --> 29:23.011
<i>Move it? Swirl it?</i>

29:23.094 --> 29:25.180
{\an5}JOSH:
<i>Yeah, well, uh, when I was</i>
<i>paying attention, yes.</i>

29:25.263 --> 29:26.514
I'm sorry.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.475
When you were paying attention?

29:28.558 --> 29:30.143
Yes, I received a phone call

29:30.226 --> 29:31.352
on my cell phone

29:31.436 --> 29:32.520
{\an1}from my fiancée
in France.

29:32.604 --> 29:33.855
{\an1}KAY:
So then what?

29:33.938 --> 29:35.690
You, uh, turned away to take it?

29:35.773 --> 29:36.983
Yes, that's correct.

29:37.066 --> 29:39.402
So, when you answered your call,

29:39.486 --> 29:41.905
{\an1}Miss Malone had not yet
sipped her drink.

29:41.988 --> 29:44.657
No, I-I think that you're
jumping to a conclusion.

29:44.741 --> 29:45.867
Um, Noah

29:45.950 --> 29:47.869
{\an3}wasn't alone with Valerie
for very long

29:47.952 --> 29:49.204
when I took that call.

29:49.287 --> 29:50.872
Well, how long are we talking?

29:50.955 --> 29:52.832
Well, I...

29:52.916 --> 29:54.334
<i>I don't know-- I'd say</i>
<i>a few minutes maybe.</i>

29:54.417 --> 29:57.337
{\an5}See ya later!
KAY:
<i>What? Two, three, four...?</i>

29:57.420 --> 29:58.671
Uh, four.

29:58.755 --> 30:00.381
Yeah, I'd venture four.

30:00.465 --> 30:01.758
You'd venture four minutes.

30:01.841 --> 30:05.595
{\an3}Well, gee, that's a
pretty long time.

30:05.678 --> 30:08.348
Not really, no.
No?

30:10.475 --> 30:12.519
Well, um...

30:12.602 --> 30:16.231
how long would you say

30:16.314 --> 30:20.151
{\an3}it would take
for this paper clip

30:20.235 --> 30:22.111
to drop to the floor?

30:22.195 --> 30:23.655
A second.

30:23.738 --> 30:24.906
{\an3}A second.

30:24.989 --> 30:28.409
Well, then, don't you think
it's possible

30:28.493 --> 30:31.412
that in those four minutes,

30:31.496 --> 30:33.790
{\an3}Noah could have
dropped a capsule

30:33.873 --> 30:35.375
<i>in Miss Malone's drink?</i>

30:35.458 --> 30:37.460
{\an5}JOSH:
<i>Yeah, well, I guess</i>
<i>it's possible.</i>

30:37.544 --> 30:40.213
<i>I mean, anything's possible.</i>

30:40.296 --> 30:41.923
{\an3}Okay.

30:42.006 --> 30:43.091
After your phone call,

30:43.174 --> 30:46.219
{\an3}where did you next see
Miss Malone and your brother?

30:46.302 --> 30:48.096
They were going up the stairs.

30:48.179 --> 30:50.723
{\an3}I'm sorry,
I didn't quite catch that.

30:51.891 --> 30:53.601
They were heading up the stairs

30:53.685 --> 30:55.270
towards Noah's office.

30:55.353 --> 30:58.565
And was Miss Malone
drinking her drink?

30:59.899 --> 31:03.611
{\an3}Josh, was she
drinking her drink?

31:07.907 --> 31:09.117
No.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.243
She'd already finished it.

31:12.870 --> 31:16.291
{\an3}All right, then,
let me see if I have

31:16.374 --> 31:17.292
all of this straight.

31:17.375 --> 31:21.462
That night, Miss Malone
ordered only one drink.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.548
{\an1}No one was with her
but you and Noah.

31:23.631 --> 31:25.466
Noah swirled her drink.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.302
And then when you
answered your call

31:27.385 --> 31:28.803
from your fiancée,

31:28.886 --> 31:31.347
Miss Malone had started
to drink her drink.

31:31.431 --> 31:33.224
{\an1}And then when you were
on your call,

31:33.308 --> 31:34.767
she finished her drink

31:34.851 --> 31:36.811
and went upstairs
with Noah.

31:36.894 --> 31:39.272
Yes.
Yes, that's correct.

31:39.355 --> 31:42.025
Then, Mr. Hunter...

31:42.108 --> 31:46.821
who else could have put
Rohypnol in her glass?

31:46.904 --> 31:49.198
{\an3}Objection!
Withdrawn.

31:49.282 --> 31:50.742
We already know the answer.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.128
I love this.

32:02.211 --> 32:03.838
{\an1}Donna, you are
pure talent.

32:03.921 --> 32:05.006
I'm glad you like it.

32:05.089 --> 32:06.591
{\an3}Like it?
Remmington

32:06.674 --> 32:08.343
{\an1}is gonna flip.
Danielle,

32:08.426 --> 32:09.677
{\an3}did you see
this work?

32:09.761 --> 32:11.012
Has definite flair.

32:11.095 --> 32:12.472
{\an1}All right, now,
for you, Miss Martin,

32:12.555 --> 32:14.015
{\an3}you've been up all night
and you're punchy.

32:14.098 --> 32:15.642
Now get outta here
and get some rest.

32:15.725 --> 32:17.727
Thank you.

32:24.400 --> 32:27.028
You stole my designs.

32:27.111 --> 32:29.197
I'm sorry, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.239
You ripped them off,

32:30.323 --> 32:32.575
you wove them into your work
and I can prove it.

32:32.659 --> 32:34.577
Well, if that's true,

32:34.661 --> 32:36.329
why didn't you say anything?

32:36.412 --> 32:38.498
Because one of us
would've gotten fired.

32:38.581 --> 32:39.999
You know the
worst part?

32:40.083 --> 32:41.876
When you started working here,
I felt threatened.

32:41.959 --> 32:44.128
{\an3}I thought you were
better than me.

32:44.212 --> 32:46.798
I was wrong.

33:00.144 --> 33:02.063
It's getting
kinda late.

33:02.146 --> 33:04.107
Yeah, kinda.

33:04.190 --> 33:06.150
Jury's deliberating.

33:06.234 --> 33:08.111
Fate in the balance.

33:08.194 --> 33:09.779
Can't be easy for you.

33:09.862 --> 33:11.614
Kelly, it was never easy.

33:11.698 --> 33:12.740
None of this.

33:15.326 --> 33:17.870
I'm trying to apologize here.

33:17.954 --> 33:20.206
I don't know how much simpler
I can say it.

33:21.207 --> 33:22.083
But hearing Josh

33:22.166 --> 33:25.211
in court today made me
see things differently.

33:25.294 --> 33:27.213
So you think I'm telling
the truth?

33:27.296 --> 33:28.756
{\an3}Yeah.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.551
{\an3}I do.

33:31.634 --> 33:33.720
{\an1}You know,
if the case goes my way,

33:33.803 --> 33:35.555
{\an1}do you think
it'll have been worth it?

33:36.556 --> 33:37.974
You'll be vindicated.

33:38.057 --> 33:39.600
You will have won.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.602
But what will I have lost?

33:46.858 --> 33:48.568
Hey.

33:48.651 --> 33:50.903
Noah, look...

33:50.987 --> 33:52.613
about my testimony--
the last thing

33:52.697 --> 33:54.532
I want to do
is make you look bad.

33:54.615 --> 33:55.616
Don't worry about it.

33:55.700 --> 33:56.951
What's done is done
in there, okay?

33:57.034 --> 33:59.287
I know, man, it's just...

33:59.370 --> 34:00.955
you're my only brother,

34:01.038 --> 34:03.040
{\an1}you know, and I don't
know how things

34:03.124 --> 34:04.250
are going to turn out.

34:04.333 --> 34:05.960
{\an3}And I thought...
Josh, listen.

34:06.043 --> 34:08.170
However the verdict
goes, I don't care.

34:08.254 --> 34:11.632
I'm glad you're
with me, okay?

34:11.716 --> 34:13.134
All right.
(pats shoulder)

34:15.344 --> 34:17.179
(gavel pounding)

34:17.263 --> 34:18.848
Mr. Foreman, has the jury
reached a verdict?

34:19.891 --> 34:21.934
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.074
Please read it to the court.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.369
We the jury,
in the charge

34:40.453 --> 34:43.331
{\an1}of sexual battery
against Valerie Malone,

34:43.414 --> 34:44.998
find for the plaintiff.

34:45.081 --> 34:46.542
(sighs)

34:46.626 --> 34:48.002
{\an1}DAVID:
Yes.

34:49.085 --> 34:50.505
{\an1}VALERIE:
Thank you.

34:50.588 --> 34:51.839
{\an1}Congratulations.
Thank you so much.

34:51.922 --> 34:52.840
(chuckling)

34:52.924 --> 34:54.132
(sighs)

34:54.217 --> 34:55.510
Yes.

34:55.592 --> 34:57.011
(yelps happily)

34:57.094 --> 34:58.721
Congratulations.
Thank you.

35:01.432 --> 35:03.100
Hey, thank you.

35:15.071 --> 35:16.322
VALERIE:
<i>Did you see them, David?</i>

35:16.405 --> 35:17.990
{\an1}I mean, did you see them
looking at me?

35:18.074 --> 35:19.200
{\an1}I-I'm walking out
of the court,

35:19.283 --> 35:20.993
{\an5}and everybody
was practically...
Yeah, they were gawking.

35:21.077 --> 35:22.036
I know.
Gawking, yeah.

35:22.119 --> 35:23.496
{\an1}I mean, one minute,
I'm a slut.

35:23.579 --> 35:24.914
The next minute,
I'm Joan of Arc.

35:24.997 --> 35:26.999
{\an3}You know, definitely
no more wagging tongues.

35:27.083 --> 35:28.709
No more smirks.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.336
No more...
Uh, skepticism?

35:30.419 --> 35:31.587
That-- skepticism.

35:31.671 --> 35:32.672
Yes.

35:32.755 --> 35:35.174
{\an1}I mean, Noah roofed me--
I proved it-- end of story.

35:35.258 --> 35:37.343
{\an3}Yep, you did it.
You won.

35:37.426 --> 35:40.304
{\an1}Then why do I feel
so awful?

35:52.859 --> 35:55.278
(sighs)

35:55.361 --> 35:57.530
You know, you barely
mentioned this car.

35:57.613 --> 36:00.074
{\an3}Yeah.

36:00.157 --> 36:01.909
{\an3}The car is stupid.
It's gross.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.412
{\an1}Can't live
with your success?

36:06.163 --> 36:08.249
I don't know. I...

36:08.332 --> 36:10.418
Isn't this what I've been
chasing? Success?

36:10.501 --> 36:11.419
I mean,

36:11.502 --> 36:13.087
look at us, Val,

36:13.170 --> 36:14.672
we're literally
on top of the world.

36:14.755 --> 36:16.424
I mean,
you with your court win and...

36:16.507 --> 36:18.134
me being music's

36:18.217 --> 36:21.262
next big whatever...

36:22.722 --> 36:24.098
That's nothing but blue skies

36:24.181 --> 36:26.100
and-and green lights,
you know, only...

36:26.183 --> 36:27.894
Jasper McQuade.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.567
I feel like
I ditched out on him.

36:35.568 --> 36:37.320
What else were you
supposed to do?

36:39.030 --> 36:41.365
David, you believed in me.

36:42.867 --> 36:44.911
You gotta start
believing in yourself.

37:02.136 --> 37:03.638
Damn it!

37:11.562 --> 37:12.605
Yes.

37:12.688 --> 37:15.483
Here's... one to take me down,

37:15.566 --> 37:17.318
one to bring me up.

37:17.401 --> 37:20.029
What?

37:20.112 --> 37:22.156
(approaching footsteps)

37:24.951 --> 37:26.494
Well, well, well...

37:26.577 --> 37:28.496
Donna...

37:28.579 --> 37:30.498
you know, it's considered polite
to call first

37:30.581 --> 37:32.333
before you rob
your boyfriend's brother.

37:32.416 --> 37:35.336
I told you I was in pain,
and you didn't give a damn!

37:35.419 --> 37:37.672
Oh, so that makes
breaking and entering okay?

37:37.755 --> 37:39.840
{\an1}Is that a new law
or is that your own?

37:39.924 --> 37:41.634
Hey, you're practically
a walking drugstore yourself.

37:41.717 --> 37:43.511
I heard what you did
for Noah in court.

37:43.594 --> 37:44.887
That's so brotherly of you.

37:44.971 --> 37:46.639
Oh, is that right?

37:46.722 --> 37:49.308
{\an1}Josh, you parked
in a handicap zone.

37:52.603 --> 37:54.146
What's going on here?

37:54.230 --> 37:55.189
Burglary in progress.

37:55.272 --> 37:57.149
{\an1}Seems your little
chickadee here

37:57.233 --> 37:58.818
{\an3}is strung out
on painkillers.

37:58.901 --> 38:00.820
{\an3}She likes to pop them
four at a time.

38:00.903 --> 38:01.862
Chucks in speed

38:01.946 --> 38:03.823
{\an1}for flavor.
Your brother set you up.

38:03.906 --> 38:05.658
You shut up.

38:05.741 --> 38:06.993
{\an3}Here.

38:07.076 --> 38:08.744
{\an3}Oh, yeah.

38:08.828 --> 38:09.912
You see here?

38:09.996 --> 38:11.038
D-amphetamine.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.373
{\an3}Oh, yeah, sure,
I gave her

38:12.456 --> 38:13.833
{\an3}a few once,
you know,

38:13.916 --> 38:15.334
to woo her off the painkillers,

38:15.418 --> 38:16.585
to wake her up
a little bit,

38:16.669 --> 38:18.004
{\an3}but now she's
gone yo-yo.

38:18.087 --> 38:19.505
First uppers, then downers.

38:19.588 --> 38:20.715
I had no idea, man.

38:20.798 --> 38:22.174
Is this true?

38:24.593 --> 38:25.970
You want truth?

38:26.053 --> 38:27.513
{\an3}Read it.

38:27.596 --> 38:29.015
Your brother's the one
that roofed Valerie.

38:29.098 --> 38:30.391
Not a stranger-- it was Josh.

38:38.441 --> 38:40.359
This has got your name
on it, man.

38:42.194 --> 38:43.946
Noah, I can explain that.

38:44.030 --> 38:47.241
I was in Paris;
I had insomnia.

38:47.324 --> 38:48.909
{\an1}Why?!

38:48.993 --> 38:49.952
I never intended this.

38:50.036 --> 38:52.038
Come on, you walked
up the stairs with Valerie.

38:52.121 --> 38:53.831
{\an3}It wasn't supposed to
turn out this way.

38:53.914 --> 38:55.041
You could've come forward.

38:55.124 --> 38:56.792
I got scared, Noah.

38:56.876 --> 38:58.377
I got scared!

38:58.461 --> 38:59.962
I mean, jail time?
Come on, you see me

39:00.046 --> 39:01.589
in jail?
I couldn't do it, man.

39:01.672 --> 39:02.715
I would die.

39:02.798 --> 39:03.758
I couldn't do it.

39:03.841 --> 39:04.925
You are pathetic.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.469
I know that, man.

39:06.552 --> 39:08.387
I know that about myself,
but listen.

39:08.471 --> 39:09.847
The only course
of action we have

39:09.930 --> 39:10.931
is to forget
about this.

39:11.015 --> 39:12.099
{\an3}It is over.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.309
It is a done deal.

39:13.392 --> 39:15.102
We pay... I'll...
I'll pay Valerie off

39:15.186 --> 39:16.437
and we move on.

39:16.520 --> 39:17.563
No.

39:17.646 --> 39:19.440
This is about the family, man.

39:19.523 --> 39:21.442
{\an3}This is about
flesh and blood.

39:21.525 --> 39:22.610
You wouldn't turn in your own

39:22.693 --> 39:23.986
flesh and blood,
would you, Noah?

39:25.696 --> 39:27.239
Would you?

39:34.205 --> 39:36.123
Uh, Valerie, I see
you got your mail.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.417
Yeah, it's been stacking up
ever since the trial began.

39:38.501 --> 39:39.627
At the <i> Beat,</i>
we've been ignoring

39:39.710 --> 39:41.087
a pile of bills
twice that high.

39:41.170 --> 39:42.296
Hmm.

39:42.379 --> 39:43.964
{\an3}Well, I guess my lawsuit's
taken its toll.

39:44.048 --> 39:45.466
{\an1}STEVE: Is that your
Porsche outside?

39:45.549 --> 39:46.967
No, it's David's.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.594
{\an3}If he makes rock star
by Monday,

39:48.677 --> 39:50.304
he can keep it
another week.

39:50.387 --> 39:52.932
{\an1}Hey, you know what,
I got these the other day.

39:53.015 --> 39:54.308
Brandon's been holding on

39:54.391 --> 39:56.018
{\an1}to some old pictures
of us.

39:57.061 --> 39:57.978
Oh, my gosh.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.314
{\an3}I must have been
like five years old.

40:00.397 --> 40:01.607
Six, actually.

40:01.690 --> 40:03.150
{\an3}(goofy accent):
You remember Mrs. Swenson's

40:03.234 --> 40:05.111
{\an1}first grade class
in Minnesota?

40:05.194 --> 40:07.446
{\an3}I don't know whether
to laugh or cry.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.949
{\an1}Well, earlier today,
I would have agreed with that.

40:10.032 --> 40:11.617
{\an1}This is a completely
different girl.

40:11.700 --> 40:12.993
{\an3}What do you mean,
my nose?

40:13.077 --> 40:14.328
No, the eyes.

40:14.411 --> 40:15.996
{\an1}I looked
a little closer,

40:16.080 --> 40:18.457
{\an1}and I saw something
I completely forgot about.

40:18.541 --> 40:20.751
Something decent.

40:21.752 --> 40:23.087
Welcome back, Val.

40:24.088 --> 40:25.131
{\an3}Thanks.

40:25.214 --> 40:26.841
Welcome home.
Thanks, babe.

40:26.924 --> 40:29.969
(doorbell ringing)

40:33.597 --> 40:34.515
{\an1}Noah.

40:34.598 --> 40:35.641
Can I come in?

40:37.101 --> 40:38.394
No, you can't.

40:40.479 --> 40:41.730
Look, if this is
about the money,

40:41.814 --> 40:42.523
{\an3}I could really
care less.

40:42.606 --> 40:44.316
I hate you
for what you did to me.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.359
{\an3}Maybe you should
just go, man.

40:45.442 --> 40:46.527
No, wait.

40:46.610 --> 40:48.320
Josh roofed your drink;
it wasn't me.

40:49.780 --> 40:51.365
Donna found this Rohypnol

40:51.448 --> 40:52.825
in Josh's briefcase.

40:52.908 --> 40:54.243
{\an1}Now, if you don't
believe me,

40:54.326 --> 40:55.411
just call her.

40:59.331 --> 41:01.500
I don't forgive you.

41:02.501 --> 41:03.836
Look, I'm sorry you were hurt.

41:03.919 --> 41:05.004
Now, if you
file charges

41:05.087 --> 41:06.380
{\an1}with the DA
against my brother,

41:06.463 --> 41:08.382
I'll support you any way I can.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.058
You all right?

41:18.142 --> 41:19.643
{\an3}Um...

41:19.727 --> 41:21.520
Steve, I-I'm supposed
to go pick up David.

41:21.604 --> 41:22.563
Do you mind taking me?

41:22.646 --> 41:23.856
{\an1}I really don't feel
like driving.

41:23.939 --> 41:25.649
Yeah, I'll take you.
Thanks.

41:27.401 --> 41:29.820
See you, guys.

41:29.904 --> 41:31.739
"And the truth
shall set you free."

41:31.822 --> 41:33.449
Yeah... well, I think

41:33.532 --> 41:36.285
that Noah and Donna are
going to need some time.

41:36.368 --> 41:39.121
{\an3}I don't really feel
like going home.

41:39.205 --> 41:40.998
{\an3}Can I stay?

41:41.081 --> 41:43.417
Mmm... sure.

41:53.552 --> 41:55.262
(doorbell ringing)

41:56.513 --> 41:57.598
Hello?

41:57.681 --> 41:58.974
Donna, it's me.

41:59.058 --> 42:00.726
You there?

42:03.020 --> 42:04.688
Hello?

42:07.399 --> 42:09.568
Donna!

42:29.004 --> 42:30.965
I have an emergency here.

42:31.048 --> 42:32.633
I need an ambulance.

42:32.716 --> 42:34.260
Drug overdose.

42:34.343 --> 42:35.844
I don't... I don't know.

42:35.928 --> 42:37.638
{\an1}I think they
were painkillers.

42:37.721 --> 42:39.181
I don't know.

42:39.265 --> 42:40.307
Her name is Martin.

42:40.391 --> 42:41.725
Donna Martin.

42:41.809 --> 42:44.019
Yeah... yeah.
