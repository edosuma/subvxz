I'm kinda beat, I came
straight from work to get you.

08:47.862 --> 08:51.130
- Okay, well, maybe tomorrow we
can go.

08:51.132 --> 08:53.999
- Yeah, yeah, I'll call in sick.

08:54.001 --> 08:57.336
- No, you don't have to
do that for me. (laughs)

08:57.338 --> 08:58.873
- They won't mind.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.212
Are you hungry?

09:07.214 --> 09:09.016
You want some Chinese?

11:32.459 --> 11:33.794
I'm good at it.

11:35.429 --> 11:36.230
- It's funny,

11:38.032 --> 11:40.301
I always thought you'd be a rock
star.

11:41.503 --> 11:42.736
- Since when?

11:44.205 --> 11:46.941
- Well, since I bought you that
guitar.

11:51.045 --> 11:52.379
You still play it?

11:53.981 --> 11:55.783
- Not so much anymore.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.085
How about these?

12:00.087 --> 12:02.955
- No, I'll get this, I'll get
this.

12:02.957 --> 12:03.922
- It's fine.

12:03.924 --> 12:07.328
- I don't need my son buying me
underwear.

12:08.495 --> 12:11.964

Did you call your grandma?

12:24.845 --> 12:25.479
- Yeah.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.248
- I knew you would.

12:29.250 --> 12:31.817
- I told her we were having a
nice day, that you were good!

12:31.819 --> 12:33.352
- Did she tell you you're a
liar?

12:33.354 --> 12:35.956
(James laughs)

12:37.191 --> 12:39.825
- So what's your plan?

12:39.827 --> 12:43.962
- I don't know, I'll
spend some time with you.

12:43.964 --> 12:48.102
Why? You want me to get
out of here already?

12:49.571 --> 12:52.137
- What about going home?

12:52.139 --> 12:54.873
- To mom and dad? Are
you out of your mind?

12:54.875 --> 12:55.543
- No, home.

12:57.478 --> 12:59.446
- Oh, to Dutch and Nancy.

13:01.382 --> 13:05.350
No, they're the reason I am the
way I am.

13:05.352 --> 13:06.186
No.

13:08.322 --> 13:11.023
Hey, you wanna go to the zoo?

13:11.025 --> 13:13.392
- The zoo? Those places are
terrible.

13:13.394 --> 13:15.427
- I used to take you all time.

13:15.429 --> 13:16.495
- Animals are meant to be in the
wild

13:16.497 --> 13:18.363
and we put them in cages.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.465
How'd you like it if people
stood around

13:20.467 --> 13:21.534
watching you suffer?

13:21.536 --> 13:23.201
- They do.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.105
- Then don't go to zoos.

13:26.407 --> 13:28.206
(James scoffs)
(Leslie grunting)

13:28.208 --> 13:29.544

13:30.944 --> 13:32.578
Stop! (laughs)

13:32.580 --> 13:34.148
What are you doing?

13:35.849 --> 13:38.483
- You on one of them dating
apps?

13:38.485 --> 13:42.524
Picking out girls like
youse fishing with dynamite?

13:43.991 --> 13:45.457
- I don't have time for that.

13:45.459 --> 13:47.259
- [Leslie] Don't have time to
have fun?

13:47.261 --> 13:50.429
- I'm working, trying to put
back.

13:50.431 --> 13:53.298
- Ah, you're trying to
do what I didn't do.

13:53.300 --> 13:56.303
Well, I'm glad I taught you
something.

14:11.452 --> 14:15.053
- Before I leave, I wanna
go over some ground rules.

14:15.055 --> 14:15.923
- Oh, okay.

14:18.292 --> 14:21.960
- You can stay here as long
as you need to make a plan.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.129
Long as you need.

14:24.131 --> 14:26.066
But you can't live here.

14:27.401 --> 14:28.603
You need a plan.

14:30.638 --> 14:31.472
- Okay.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.140
- And no drinking.

14:35.142 --> 14:37.075
- Baby, I don't drink no more.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.343
- [James] We can smoke
pot, that's fine, but-

14:38.345 --> 14:42.983
- Baby, I don't drink like I
used to.

14:47.689 --> 14:52.259

15:01.569 --> 15:02.604
- Good night.

15:05.707 --> 15:06.606
(birds chirping)

15:06.608 --> 15:07.507
- I'll be home around 6:00.

15:07.509 --> 15:10.645
Just, we can take a walk or
something.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.590

17:13.835 --> 17:15.535
- She passed away.

17:15.537 --> 17:16.702
- [Leslie] I'm sorry.

17:16.704 --> 17:17.703
- Yeah, life sucks.

17:17.704 --> 17:18.771
(James laughs)

17:18.772 --> 17:21.474
- Don't you laugh at him, he's
sad.

17:24.176 --> 17:25.310
- You like to be around James?

17:25.311 --> 17:28.246
- [Leslie] Oh, I love it.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.716
- When's the last time
you all saw each other?

17:30.718 --> 17:32.752
- It must been six years.

17:32.754 --> 17:35.721
- [Darren] Damn, six years? How
come?

17:35.723 --> 17:37.823
- Hey, will you mind
your own business? Jesus.

17:37.825 --> 17:38.760
- He's fine.

17:40.695 --> 17:43.763
He don't need me riding him
the way my mama rode me.

17:43.765 --> 17:46.264
- That's James's grandma?

17:46.266 --> 17:47.467
What's she like?

17:49.804 --> 17:51.236
- Baptist.

17:51.238 --> 17:56.174
- (laughs) She said, "Baptist."

17:56.176 --> 17:58.778
(all laugh)

17:58.780 --> 18:00.480
- You two are funny.

18:01.516 --> 18:04.115
- I mean, what's wrong with
going to Dutch and Nancy's?

18:04.117 --> 18:06.652
- Those people are evil.

18:06.654 --> 18:08.253
- They're fine.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.388
- You don't know 'em like I do.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.727
- You don't know 'em like I do.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.734
Are you good in here?

18:24.204 --> 18:24.839
What?

18:32.513 --> 18:34.816
- I'm just stoned, is all.

18:38.519 --> 18:40.253
Night night, sweetie.

18:41.789 --> 18:42.790
- Good night.

19:06.213 --> 19:08.683
(Leslie groans)

19:22.964 --> 19:25.833
(machine whirring)

19:44.719 --> 19:47.653
(door opens)
(door closes)

19:47.655 --> 19:48.488
Mom?

19:59.600 --> 20:00.635
Motherfucker.

20:03.470 --> 20:07.338
(door bangs)
(loud music)

20:07.340 --> 20:09.744
(James knocks)

20:12.013 --> 20:13.579
Hey, you seen my mom?

20:13.581 --> 20:14.613
- No, everything okay?

20:14.615 --> 20:16.281
- Chris? Nothing?

20:16.283 --> 20:17.016
- No.

20:17.018 --> 20:17.883
- Everything alright?

20:17.885 --> 20:19.854
- Just call me if you do.

20:23.558 --> 20:28.462
(door closes)
(car horn honks)

20:31.866 --> 20:32.765
(group cheering)

20:32.767 --> 20:35.300
(man faintly speaking)

20:35.302 --> 20:36.301
- [Group] Yeah.

20:36.303 --> 20:37.002
- [Man] That's right, okay.

20:37.004 --> 20:38.504
Now, (faintly speaking).

20:38.506 --> 20:41.372
(footsteps pattering)

20:41.374 --> 20:42.608
- Where have you been?

20:42.610 --> 20:43.542
(door shuts)

20:43.544 --> 20:44.677
- Well, you're home early!

20:44.679 --> 20:47.546
- I've been all over town
looking for you.

20:47.548 --> 20:49.380
- I was here, baby, watching TV.

20:49.382 --> 20:50.850
- Mom?!

20:50.852 --> 20:53.485
- I was here and I went for a
walk

20:53.487 --> 20:57.625
'cause I've been cooped up in
here.

20:58.860 --> 21:03.461
So I went looking for a job.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.731
- [James] A job?
- Yeah.

21:05.733 --> 21:09.003
Gonna get my plan - you
know, figure out my plan.

21:12.439 --> 21:14.876
Hey, what's wrong? Are you okay?

21:16.376 --> 21:18.677
Honey, are you okay?

21:18.679 --> 21:20.613
- What kind of job?

21:20.615 --> 21:21.680
- What kind?

21:21.682 --> 21:25.416
(laughs) Any kind!

21:25.418 --> 21:28.288
(laughs) Any kind.

21:29.690 --> 21:31.424
- Were you next door?

21:32.860 --> 21:35.561
(Leslie scoffs)

21:35.563 --> 21:37.530
Jesus fucking Christ!

21:37.532 --> 21:40.735
- Baby, baby, baby!

21:42.335 --> 21:45.403
Baby? Oh!

21:45.405 --> 21:48.373
(James knocks)

21:48.375 --> 21:49.708
- [James] Was she in here-

21:49.710 --> 21:50.576
- [Will] Hey, man, look-
- When I was talking to you?

21:50.578 --> 21:51.476
- [Will] We was just having a
beer.

21:51.478 --> 21:52.443
- You were having a beer with my
mother?

21:52.445 --> 21:53.344
- [Will] I didn't know that was
a problem.

21:53.346 --> 21:55.413
- [James] No? Then why'd you lie
about it?

21:55.415 --> 21:56.481
- [Will] Because she
freaked when she heard you.

21:56.483 --> 21:57.550
Okay, I don't know what's
going on between you two-

21:57.552 --> 21:59.752
- Don't talk to her again!
Don't talk to her again!

21:59.754 --> 22:00.986
- Dude, you need to calm down!

22:00.988 --> 22:03.055
- Oh, come on!
- Come on, come on!

22:03.057 --> 22:05.526
(indistinct)

22:07.995 --> 22:10.497
(indistinct)

22:15.468 --> 22:16.969
(indistinct)

22:16.971 --> 22:19.370
- Baby? Baby, baby.

22:19.372 --> 22:20.873
Baby, please, I went out.

22:20.875 --> 22:22.608
I was just trying to have
some fun, 'cause it's-

22:22.610 --> 22:24.877
- You stole money from Darren.

22:24.879 --> 22:25.811
- What?

22:25.813 --> 22:26.645
- You stole money from Darren.

22:26.647 --> 22:27.613
- I didn't steal.

22:27.615 --> 22:28.848
Did he tell you that?

22:28.850 --> 22:31.083
- Come on, lie to me
again. Lie to me again!

22:31.085 --> 22:34.452
- I'm your mother, I would
not steal money from you.

22:34.454 --> 22:35.386
What are you doing?

22:35.388 --> 22:38.526
Get off of me. (groans)

22:39.492 --> 22:41.428
- Un-fucking-believable!

22:42.997 --> 22:45.099
- You fucking chicken shit!

22:46.033 --> 22:46.868
Hey! Baby?

22:48.903 --> 22:51.804
Hey, hey.

22:51.806 --> 22:53.873
- What did I say?! No drinking!

22:53.875 --> 22:55.608
(bottle clatters)

22:55.610 --> 22:56.809
- I'm your mother, you cannot
talk to me this way, James.

22:56.811 --> 22:58.510
- Mother? Mother?!

22:58.512 --> 22:59.511
- Yes, your momma

22:59.513 --> 23:01.115
stop it.
- You're a drunk!

23:02.617 --> 23:03.584
- I am sick.

23:07.755 --> 23:10.189
- I'm not gonna do this again,
I'm not.

23:10.191 --> 23:11.893
- You? What about me?

23:14.494 --> 23:16.427
We were supposed to have a good
life.

23:16.429 --> 23:17.830
I didn't want this for you.

23:17.832 --> 23:20.666
- I had a good life until you
showed up.

23:20.668 --> 23:22.568
I'm not even 20.

23:22.570 --> 23:23.468
I can't even drink yet,

23:23.470 --> 23:24.839
and I have to take care of my
mother?

23:25.940 --> 23:28.042
I have to take care of you?

23:29.076 --> 23:30.976
I made one rule, no drinking,

23:30.978 --> 23:33.814
and you couldn't last a fucking
day!

23:37.184 --> 23:39.186
- I'm sad.

23:43.090 --> 23:44.525
I can't help it.

23:46.627 --> 23:48.627
But I wanna be a good momma.

23:48.629 --> 23:51.597
I wanna be a good momma again.

23:51.599 --> 23:54.199
Baby, I wanna be a good momma, I
do.

23:54.201 --> 23:56.170
I love you so much, baby.

23:57.538 --> 23:59.238
Who are you calling?

23:59.240 --> 24:01.175
Are you calling grandma?

24:02.209 --> 24:04.109
You do not call my mother!

24:04.111 --> 24:05.544
She is my mother!

24:05.546 --> 24:07.581
You do not call my mother!

24:11.986 --> 24:14.221
You leave her out of this!

24:25.666 --> 24:28.468
(car engine revs)

24:43.651 --> 24:45.951
What are you doing? Why are they
here?

24:45.953 --> 24:48.020
- Taking you to the bus station.

24:48.022 --> 24:48.856
- No baby.

24:55.162 --> 24:57.062
I will not go out again, baby.

24:57.064 --> 24:58.532
- I called Dutch.

25:01.702 --> 25:03.102
- Dutch?

25:03.104 --> 25:06.807
- He's gonna pick you
up when you get to town.

25:07.975 --> 25:10.778
- Baby don't make me go back
there.

25:12.279 --> 25:14.148
No, no.

25:19.220 --> 25:21.722
You're just like your grandma!

25:30.164 --> 25:30.998
Baby

25:36.804 --> 25:38.105
I love you so much.

25:40.307 --> 25:41.909
I love you so much.

25:43.310 --> 25:44.979
Don't do this to me.

25:48.082 --> 25:50.317
- I hope that fills your cup.

25:52.253 --> 25:55.220
(door opens)
(door shuts)

25:55.222 --> 25:57.725
(soft music)

25:58.826 --> 26:01.595
(birds chirping)

26:04.698 --> 26:07.835
(soft music continues)

26:18.946 --> 26:21.949
(bus engine revving)

26:33.260 --> 26:36.030
(car horn honks)

26:40.801 --> 26:41.635
- Hi.

26:51.112 --> 26:53.745
(car door shuts)

26:53.747 --> 26:56.750
(car engine revving)

27:06.994 --> 27:09.730
(birds chirping)

27:19.373 --> 27:20.439
(car door shuts)

27:20.441 --> 27:23.711
(footsteps pattering)

27:47.201 --> 27:51.336
Yeah, it's just putting money
down on two different places

27:51.338 --> 27:53.305
and never got that back.

27:53.307 --> 27:57.178
My car got fucking stolen
and shit just piled up.

27:58.946 --> 28:00.412
- All that time, you weren't
working?

28:00.414 --> 28:01.248
- I was.

28:09.123 --> 28:13.460
Well, how are you doing, Nance?

28:17.498 --> 28:18.465
- Alright.

28:20.768 --> 28:22.937
James told us what happened.

28:31.445 --> 28:32.279
Stop!

28:35.249 --> 28:37.316
Go on, go ahead.

28:37.318 --> 28:38.152
Go ahead.

28:41.922 --> 28:43.123
- Help yourself.

28:44.925 --> 28:45.993
You always do.

28:52.199 --> 28:57.002
- The only reason we agreed
to put you up is that boy,

28:57.004 --> 28:58.003
and what you did for us.

28:58.005 --> 28:59.438
- Don't you give her that!

28:59.440 --> 29:00.372
- Do you want to do this?

29:00.374 --> 29:02.007
- We put a helluva lot more to
this place

29:02.009 --> 29:04.409
than what she gave us.

29:04.411 --> 29:05.545
- The only reason you're here

29:05.547 --> 29:07.846
is James.

29:07.848 --> 29:10.849
But there will be none of
that shit you pulled on him.

29:10.851 --> 29:14.286
This is my house, you
will follow my rules.

29:14.288 --> 29:16.321
- Dutch, don't talk like that.

29:16.323 --> 29:19.927
- I ain't fucking around,
Lee, I'll put you on the curb!

29:21.395 --> 29:22.863
- Dutch, it's me.

29:36.010 --> 29:39.280
What y'all doing tonight?

29:41.415 --> 29:43.183
- We're having a fire.

29:44.485 --> 29:45.817
- Would you do me favor

29:45.819 --> 29:48.789
and you just don't tell anyone
I'm here?

29:50.090 --> 29:52.592
- Nance already did.

29:52.594 --> 29:55.260
You're welcome to join, but
you will be painting tomorrow,

29:55.262 --> 29:59.464
so you might wanna think
about getting some rest.

29:59.466 --> 30:00.499
- I'm painting?

30:00.501 --> 30:02.535
- Yeah, yeah, to start with.

30:02.537 --> 30:04.936
This ain't a charity, Lee.

30:04.938 --> 30:06.238
We ain't them derelicts you spit
on,

30:06.240 --> 30:09.174
and we ain't partying no more.

30:09.176 --> 30:12.210
We work, when we come
home, we work some more.

30:12.212 --> 30:14.379
So don't expect a repeat.

30:14.381 --> 30:19.318
Ain't no one taking your shit
a second time, you got it?

30:19.320 --> 30:22.555
- Is that you talking or
is that Nancy talking?

30:22.557 --> 30:27.094
- (laughs) You know where the
door is.

30:32.466 --> 30:34.132
Are you fucking kidding me?

30:34.134 --> 30:35.067
- No.
- Man, she was a fish.

30:35.069 --> 30:37.035
- (indistinct) Yeah.
- You remember that?

30:37.037 --> 30:38.003
- Yeah.
- She could drink

30:38.005 --> 30:39.237
all of ya'll under the table.

30:39.239 --> 30:40.472
(group laughs)

30:40.474 --> 30:41.607
- [Man] Hell yeah.

30:41.609 --> 30:43.442
(Nancy laughs)

30:43.444 --> 30:45.545
- She just blew all that money?

30:45.547 --> 30:47.112
- Yeah.
- Yeah. (laughs)

30:47.114 --> 30:48.246
- Yeah.

30:48.248 --> 30:49.381
- Where's she been?

30:49.383 --> 30:51.249
- Well, why don't we ask her?

30:51.251 --> 30:52.117
- Yeah.

30:52.119 --> 30:52.918
- [Group] Go.

30:52.920 --> 30:56.188
- Leslie?
- No, don't (indistinct).

30:56.190 --> 30:58.323
Pete, no, don't you call her
out!

30:58.325 --> 31:01.126
(speakers faintly speaking)

31:01.128 --> 31:01.962
- Leslie?

31:04.331 --> 31:05.165
Leslie?

31:06.367 --> 31:07.401
Leslie

31:08.636 --> 31:10.003
I know you're in there

31:18.912 --> 31:20.447
- That was breakfast.

31:26.621 --> 31:31.593
(bushes rattling)
(chain jingling)

31:32.059 --> 31:37.097
(can crackling)
(bushes rattling)

31:40.702 --> 31:45.573
(car door shuts)
(car engine revving)

31:47.441 --> 31:50.377
(crickets chirping)

31:55.449 --> 31:56.948
(speakers faintly speaking)

31:56.950 --> 31:58.518
- Oh my God, lower your fucking
voice!

31:58.520 --> 31:59.418
- I don't care.

31:59.420 --> 32:00.152
- She fucking hears that.

32:00.154 --> 32:01.687
- I can give two fucking shits!

32:01.689 --> 32:02.954
I hope she fucking does!

32:02.956 --> 32:05.490
- What do you want! You want
me to knock her around for you?

32:05.492 --> 32:06.659
Pop her in the mouth?

32:06.661 --> 32:09.327
- No, I want her out of my
fucking house!

32:09.329 --> 32:10.228
- Who's fucking stopping you!

32:10.230 --> 32:13.165
- You're the one who let her in
here!

32:13.167 --> 32:15.100
- He called me crying, he
was begging on the phone.

32:15.102 --> 32:16.602
What the fuck was I supposed to
do

49:05.479 --> 49:08.081
and help guests with their bags.

49:09.049 --> 49:09.684
- That it?

49:11.351 --> 49:14.219
- That is it, really,
pretty much it, right.

49:14.221 --> 49:15.721
- Okay.

49:15.723 --> 49:17.690
- [Sweeney] And nothing
tonight, we'll start tomorrow.

49:17.692 --> 49:20.125
- Okay! (laughs)

49:20.127 --> 49:20.961
- Okay.

49:23.030 --> 49:24.564
Royal, the other one of us,

49:24.566 --> 49:26.064
we're about to have supper,

49:26.066 --> 49:28.433
if you wanna join us,
you're more than welcome.

49:28.435 --> 49:30.268
- Thank you.

49:30.270 --> 49:33.305
I think I'm gonna settle in.

49:33.307 --> 49:36.174
- Right, of course, I'll leave
you to it.

49:36.176 --> 49:37.543
- Alright. Hey?

49:37.545 --> 49:39.144
- Yeah.
(Leslie clears throat)

49:39.146 --> 49:40.479
- When do I get paid?

49:40.481 --> 49:44.382
- (laughs) Right, of course,
that's pretty important.

49:44.384 --> 49:45.587
End of the week.

49:48.088 --> 49:52.727
But if you needed an
advance, I could probably...

49:53.093 --> 49:54.594
- It would help.

49:54.596 --> 49:55.663
- Right, okay.

49:57.632 --> 49:58.700
Not a problem.

50:00.668 --> 50:03.068
How's 50? Is that...

50:03.070 --> 50:04.037
- No, God.

50:07.474 --> 50:08.541
Thank you!

50:08.543 --> 50:11.679
- Okay, alright. So, great.

50:14.281 --> 50:15.715
Well, good night then.

50:15.717 --> 50:17.517
- Good night, I'll see you
tomorrow.

50:17.519 --> 50:19.417
- Yes, you will, you will.

50:19.419 --> 50:22.487
Sleep well. Yeah, good night.

50:22.489 --> 50:25.025
(door closes)

50:27.160 --> 50:28.761
(Leslie sighs)

50:28.763 --> 50:33.701
(Leslie snores)
(birds chirping)

50:34.134 --> 50:36.268
- Damn clock didn't go off.

50:36.270 --> 50:37.737
- Hey, look, it's okay.

50:37.739 --> 50:39.471
You didn't know, I didn't tell
you,

50:39.473 --> 50:42.642
but we start at 8:00 AM around
here.

50:42.644 --> 50:43.543
- Good to know.

50:43.545 --> 50:45.243
- Alright. You know what?

50:45.245 --> 50:49.149
Let me get you a key so you
can get into the other rooms.

50:51.285 --> 50:53.385
Oh, come on, come on.

50:53.387 --> 50:54.286
- Thank you.
- Why don't you take that.

50:54.288 --> 50:55.721
- Thank you.

50:55.723 --> 50:58.793
Hi, Royal! You remember me?

51:00.695 --> 51:01.529
- (sniffles)

51:03.297 --> 51:04.131
I do.

51:06.333 --> 51:08.199
- How you doing?

51:08.201 --> 51:10.772
(indistinct)
Okay.

51:11.873 --> 51:14.707
Well, I'll get to it.

51:14.709 --> 51:15.575
- Okay.
- Bye.

51:15.577 --> 51:17.677
- If you need anything, let me
know.

51:17.679 --> 51:18.513
- Sure.

51:23.216 --> 51:25.687
(Sweeney sighs)

51:30.758 --> 51:35.563
- Hey, Royal, you seen a
pink suitcase about so big?

51:44.539 --> 51:47.542
(car engine revving)

51:58.318 --> 51:59.384
(door closes)
- Hey, she'll get

51:59.386 --> 52:01.621
the hang of it, man.

52:01.623 --> 52:02.888
- Cleaning the room.

52:02.890 --> 52:04.857
Real mountain to climb.

52:04.859 --> 52:07.662
(car engine revs)

52:10.330 --> 52:15.202
(soft music)
(washing machine whirring)

52:24.277 --> 52:26.277
- A good way is to use your
finger, okay?

52:26.279 --> 52:28.814
And if there's guck on it,
then you need to do it again.

52:28.816 --> 52:29.548
I mean, I don't wanna

52:29.550 --> 52:31.182
be a hard-ass, Leslie-
- No.

52:31.184 --> 52:32.350
- But clean is clean.

52:32.352 --> 52:33.819
- Yeah, yeah,

52:33.821 --> 52:35.821
I guess I'm just getting used to

52:35.823 --> 52:37.422
how things work around here.

52:37.424 --> 52:39.692
- Yeah, we do it right
the first time around.

52:39.694 --> 52:40.860
- Okay, yes, sir.

52:40.862 --> 52:42.828
- Okay, alright then.

52:42.830 --> 52:44.730
Well, good night.

52:44.732 --> 52:46.734
- Hey, hey, hey, can I...

52:48.468 --> 52:50.836
Could I have the other
half of that advance

52:50.838 --> 52:52.370
that you gave me?

52:52.372 --> 52:54.940
'Cause I spent the first
half on groceries, and I

52:54.942 --> 52:55.775
was thinking it'd be so nice

52:55.777 --> 52:58.811
to have some flowers for the
room.

52:58.813 --> 52:59.714
- Uh huh.

53:03.417 --> 53:04.282
There you go.

53:04.284 --> 53:05.851
(Leslie chuckles)

53:05.853 --> 53:08.623
(engine revving)

53:09.991 --> 53:11.389
- [Leslie] Thank you.

53:11.391 --> 53:12.825
- Alright.

53:12.827 --> 53:17.699
(crickets chirping)
(car engine revving)

53:22.537 --> 53:26.607
(Nancy laughs)

53:35.717 --> 53:37.552
- Where's Dutch, Nance?

53:38.586 --> 53:39.752
What, you got the balls to

53:39.754 --> 53:40.986
throw me out you fucking house,

53:40.988 --> 53:42.655
but you can't look at me?

53:42.657 --> 53:44.890
- Little girl, you need to look
around.

53:44.892 --> 53:46.625
- Little girl?

53:46.627 --> 53:47.895
You fucking wish.

53:50.497 --> 53:51.664
You don't gotta worry about me

53:51.666 --> 53:56.336
because despite your best
effort, I ain't going nowhere.

53:57.805 --> 53:58.973
I got me a job.

53:59.874 --> 54:03.042
I got a place to stay,
so you better watch out.

54:03.044 --> 54:04.677
Bang, bang.

54:04.679 --> 54:05.845
- Y'all remember, Leslie, don't
you?

54:05.847 --> 54:07.980
Helen and Raymond's little girl?

54:07.982 --> 54:11.584
- That's right, our lucky lotto
winner!

54:11.586 --> 54:13.819
- You remember the Brickmans?

54:13.821 --> 54:15.788
Mr. and Mrs. Brickman and Warren
Parnell.

54:15.790 --> 54:18.824
He used to play Sunday Oregon.

54:18.826 --> 54:21.326
I'm sure they'd love to hear
what's going on in your life.

54:21.328 --> 54:23.529
Why don't you pull up a seat?

54:23.531 --> 54:24.632
- How are you?

54:25.767 --> 54:27.666
You disappeared on us.

54:27.668 --> 54:31.036
- Me? I'm fine.

54:31.038 --> 54:34.039
- And your folks? I do miss
them.

54:34.041 --> 54:35.941
- Yeah, they're well.

54:35.943 --> 54:37.879
They're down in Florida.

54:39.547 --> 54:42.748
- Next time you speak to 'em,
tell 'em I'm thinking of 'em.

54:42.750 --> 54:43.751
- Oh, I will.

54:44.852 --> 54:45.851
- You know, Leslie,

54:45.853 --> 54:48.319
we still pray for you.

54:48.321 --> 54:50.388
No matter what's been done,

54:50.390 --> 54:52.860
the church is still here for
you.

54:54.095 --> 54:55.830
I hope you know that.

55:00.868 --> 55:05.673
- Well, sorry for the
interruption.

55:07.775 --> 55:12.547
And I hope you all have a
good night and God bless.

55:16.083 --> 55:17.450
And ya know,

55:18.786 --> 55:22.387
I'm just gonna be over
here enjoying myself,

55:22.389 --> 55:25.758
if you get tired of ole saddle
bags here.

55:25.760 --> 55:27.059
- See you around, Lee.

55:27.061 --> 55:28.529
- Yeah, you will.

55:29.564 --> 55:31.096
- I apologize.

55:31.098 --> 55:35.937

Royal, will you tell him
my alarm didn't go off?

Is that where you put your tree?

01:02:10.164 --> 01:02:13.065

out.

I haven't been myself late-.

01:06:19.012 --> 01:06:20.380

01:06:21.616 --> 01:06:26.017
And this is a good job, I
understand that.

01:06:26.019 --> 01:06:28.121
And I messed up, I'm sorry.

01:06:30.357 --> 01:06:33.225
- If you got people,
I can take you to 'em.

01:06:33.227 --> 01:06:34.159
- If I had,

01:06:34.161 --> 01:06:35.329
I'da called 'em last night.

01:06:36.363 --> 01:06:38.096
- I might look stupid to you
but-

01:06:38.098 --> 01:06:39.799
- You don't.

01:06:39.801 --> 01:06:42.668
- Yeah, well, I ain't one for
letting people get over on me.

01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:45.205
- You could've fooled me there.

01:06:49.276 --> 01:06:50.442
Look, it might not be obvious to
you,

01:06:50.444 --> 01:06:54.214
but I'm asking to stay.

01:07:06.628 --> 01:07:11.263
- When you finish that,
go check in with Royal.

01:07:11.265 --> 01:07:15.302
There's some crap behind
16, he needs help sorting.

01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:33.853
(cup clanks)
(vacuum cleaner whirring)

01:07:33.855 --> 01:07:35.322
(door closes)

01:07:52.807 --> 01:07:57.679
(vacuum cleaner whirring)
(door closes)

01:08:07.722 --> 01:08:12.594
(Leslie vomits)
(Leslie coughs)

01:08:16.263 --> 01:08:18.863
(water running)

01:08:18.866 --> 01:08:21.803
(crickets chirping)

01:08:30.678 --> 01:08:35.550
(Royal howls)
(Sweeney chuckles)

01:08:37.585 --> 01:08:40.586
- Royal. We like to keep him
around.

01:08:40.587 --> 01:08:45.392
Something for the kids to
poke a stick at. (laughs)

01:08:48.863 --> 01:08:50.330
How long you been drinking?

01:08:52.432 --> 01:08:54.736
Okay, mind my business?

01:08:56.604 --> 01:08:57.470
Sure thing.

01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:13.385
Royal, that's not even the
weirdest thing he does.

01:09:13.386 --> 01:09:14.787
You'll see in time.

01:09:14.788 --> 01:09:15.688
You'll see for yourself.

01:09:15.689 --> 01:09:18.924
He'll get butt-naked and run
that field

01:09:18.926 --> 01:09:21.192
just screaming like a damn wild
man.

01:09:21.194 --> 01:09:24.697
(laughs) It's crazy, man!

01:09:24.698 --> 01:09:29.537
He'll just go, just running
naked, crazy!

01:09:30.138 --> 01:09:31.837
You wait till you'll see it.

01:09:31.839 --> 01:09:35.608
Oh, man, the cops don't even
bother with him anymore.

01:09:35.609 --> 01:09:37.843
He does it so damn much.

01:09:37.845 --> 01:09:39.546
Crazy son of a bitch.

01:09:41.983 --> 01:09:43.849
You know...

01:09:43.850 --> 01:09:47.955
quitting cold turkey, it's a
good way to shock your system.

01:09:51.224 --> 01:09:54.361
- Well, I don't got a choice.

01:09:55.897 --> 01:09:57.932
- Someone making you quit?

01:10:03.871 --> 01:10:06.237
(Royal howls)

01:10:06.239 --> 01:10:09.775
Alright, well, you don't
seem like you wanna talk

01:10:09.777 --> 01:10:12.477
and that's okay,
(Royal howls)

01:10:12.479 --> 01:10:14.412
but we're trying to eat dinner
here

01:10:14.414 --> 01:10:15.413
and I don't wanna listen to
that.

01:10:15.415 --> 01:10:19.484
So is there some music
you'd like me to put on?

01:10:19.486 --> 01:10:20.621
- You can pick.

01:10:21.956 --> 01:10:25.891
- Okay, why don't we just play

01:10:25.893 --> 01:10:28.495
whatever Royal's got on there?

01:10:31.866 --> 01:10:33.298
Just let ol'

01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:34.902
D.J. Royal spin it

01:10:39.874 --> 01:10:42.342

- [Sweeney] Hey, do you need
anything?

01:12:20.041 --> 01:12:22.007
I can bring you something to
eat.

01:12:22.009 --> 01:12:23.811
Something to throw up.

01:12:25.378 --> 01:12:27.849

01:12:29.016 --> 01:12:29.882
I'll give you time,

01:12:29.884 --> 01:12:31.650
but three and four need to be
turned

01:12:31.652 --> 01:12:34.452
and the sheets need folding.

01:12:34.454 --> 01:12:36.822
- Can't you give me a fucking
break?

01:12:36.824 --> 01:12:39.792
- [Sweeney] Hey, don't be
yelling at me.

01:12:39.794 --> 01:12:40.928
Three and four.

01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:44.699
- Three and four.

01:12:49.770 --> 01:12:52.372
(Leslie sighs)

01:12:57.812 --> 01:13:01.747

(door closes)

01:13:02.650 --> 01:13:04.752
- I folded all them sheets.

01:13:06.153 --> 01:13:07.920
- I'm a one man parade.

01:13:07.922 --> 01:13:10.823
- (laughs) What is that?

01:13:10.825 --> 01:13:13.692
- I got Salisbury steak
with mashed potatoes

01:13:13.694 --> 01:13:17.162
and roast turkey breast and
stuffing.

01:13:17.164 --> 01:13:19.965
What would you like to eat?

01:13:19.967 --> 01:13:23.168
- I'll have a Salisbury steak.

01:13:23.170 --> 01:13:25.804
- [Sweeney] Yes, ma'am. How
would you like that cooked?

01:13:25.806 --> 01:13:28.576
How about just hot?

01:13:30.477 --> 01:13:31.476
(oven beeps)

01:13:31.478 --> 01:13:34.914
- Thank you.
(oven whirring)

01:13:34.916 --> 01:13:38.019
- So did you want me to stay
here again?

01:13:43.991 --> 01:13:44.825
Okay.

01:13:54.201 --> 01:13:55.801
- Did you eat something?

01:13:55.803 --> 01:13:57.204
- I did, thank you.

01:14:04.178 --> 01:14:05.110
- Ya know?

01:14:05.112 --> 01:14:08.479
I think you'd better leave.

01:14:08.481 --> 01:14:10.950
- Oh, come on, I been
hearing you all week.

01:14:10.952 --> 01:14:12.084
- It's the other end.

01:14:12.086 --> 01:14:13.752
- Oh, geez, alright.

01:14:13.754 --> 01:14:15.754
Well, if you need anything, let
me know.

01:14:15.756 --> 01:14:16.622
- Yeah.

01:14:16.624 --> 01:14:19.193
- Okay.

01:14:20.227 --> 01:14:21.126
(door shuts)

01:14:21.128 --> 01:14:25.132
(quiet movie playing)

01:14:45.619 --> 01:14:48.220
(Sweeney knocks)

01:14:48.222 --> 01:14:50.889
- Go away or I'll call the
police.

01:14:50.891 --> 01:14:52.460
- How's your tummy?

01:14:58.599 --> 01:15:02.169
- You know, I don't really
wanna talk about that with you.

01:15:03.304 --> 01:15:04.937
But thank you for the pills.

01:15:04.939 --> 01:15:06.805
- That was Royal's idea.

01:15:06.807 --> 01:15:09.243
- Well, I'll thank him tomorrow.

01:15:11.178 --> 01:15:12.911
Couldn't sleep, huh?

01:15:12.913 --> 01:15:17.049
- Nope, and I wanted to tell you

01:15:17.051 --> 01:15:19.651
that you're doing good work.

01:15:19.653 --> 01:15:22.823
The place looks real clean
and the guests are real happy.

01:15:24.592 --> 01:15:27.326
- Thank the Lord, I did it. I'm
a maid.

01:15:27.328 --> 01:15:30.295
(Sweeney laughs)

01:15:30.297 --> 01:15:33.198
- Yeah, so when Royal's daddy
died

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:36.835
and left him the place, I
was already staying here.

01:15:36.837 --> 01:15:39.738
So he asked me if I would help
him run it.

01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:41.974
- Wait, this is Royal's motel?

01:15:41.976 --> 01:15:43.575
- It is.

01:15:43.577 --> 01:15:45.711
Didn't you grow up together?

01:15:45.713 --> 01:15:48.280
- Damn, we ain't run in the same
circles.

01:15:48.282 --> 01:15:49.348
- Well, that's probably better
off,

01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:51.650
'cause somehow he did so much
LSD

01:15:51.652 --> 01:15:54.153
that it permanently rewired his
brain.

01:15:54.155 --> 01:15:56.255
(Leslie laughs)
I'm serious.

01:15:56.257 --> 01:15:58.993
I mean, he can function, but
man,

01:16:00.061 --> 01:16:02.963
you ask him to remember to pay a
bill?

01:16:04.198 --> 01:16:06.934
So, I get a room and a small
wage.

01:16:08.602 --> 01:16:11.070
- And what'd you do before this?

01:16:11.072 --> 01:16:12.640
- I never did much.

01:16:14.308 --> 01:16:18.345
I worked the oil field and got
divorced.

01:16:19.713 --> 01:16:21.080
So run a motel?

01:16:21.082 --> 01:16:22.848
Sure, I'll do it.

01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:26.385
- And that picture you
keep, is that your ex-wife?

01:16:26.387 --> 01:16:29.221
- No, that is my daughter,
Bernice and her baby.

01:16:29.223 --> 01:16:32.026
(Leslie chuckles)

01:16:34.028 --> 01:16:36.261
- Did you leave them?

01:16:36.263 --> 01:16:38.030
- No, I left my wife.

01:16:38.032 --> 01:16:39.798
I see them as much as possible.

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:42.367
They live about an hour away
from here.

01:16:42.369 --> 01:16:44.738
- Just didn't work out, huh?

01:16:46.373 --> 01:16:48.242
- Well, she drank.

01:16:51.679 --> 01:16:54.381
And she beat the drinking.

01:16:56.851 --> 01:17:01.687
And the church that helped
her, I did not care for.

01:17:01.689 --> 01:17:05.057
And she liked the church
and like the pastor more.

01:17:05.059 --> 01:17:07.392
- No (chuckles).
- Yes (chuckles).

01:17:07.394 --> 01:17:09.128
Preacher stole my wife.

01:17:09.130 --> 01:17:10.762
- That's a gold record right
there.

01:17:10.764 --> 01:17:11.964
- You think Willie would sing
it?

01:17:11.966 --> 01:17:12.965
- I think he sang about it.

01:17:12.967 --> 01:17:16.103
- (laughs) Yeah, I think he did.

01:17:18.172 --> 01:17:19.406
- And your girl?

01:17:20.441 --> 01:17:21.642
- A good kid.

01:17:23.077 --> 01:17:26.178
Had troubles with men, like
y'all do,

01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:28.782
but she turned out good, though.

01:17:31.085 --> 01:17:32.918
Hey, I didn't mean nothing

01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:36.355
by saying her drinking led to
our divorce.

01:17:36.357 --> 01:17:38.790
It did, but she ain't you

01:17:38.792 --> 01:17:42.194
and things don't go the
same way for any two people.

01:17:42.196 --> 01:17:45.130
And I don't think any less of
you

01:17:45.132 --> 01:17:47.701
for having the problems you do.

01:17:56.710 --> 01:18:01.713
So, hey, I wanted to ask you

01:18:01.715 --> 01:18:05.751
if you wanted to join
me and Royal at a dance.

01:18:05.753 --> 01:18:07.486
- Now you don't wanna ask me no
more?

01:18:07.488 --> 01:18:12.393
- No, I am, I'm asking
you, but it's a town thing.

01:18:12.661 --> 01:18:14.493
It's-
- A town thing?

01:18:14.495 --> 01:18:16.094
- Yeah, right.

01:18:16.096 --> 01:18:18.732
Meaning, everyone will be there.

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:21.302
The whole town and...

01:18:22.937 --> 01:18:24.205
- Oh,

01:18:27.808 --> 01:18:28.842
Yeah, no thank you.

01:18:30.010 --> 01:18:34.949
- I'm just saying that it's your
home too.

01:18:35.282 --> 01:18:37.249
And if you're planning on doing
something

01:18:37.251 --> 01:18:41.453
other than eating TV dinners
with me and the space cadet,

01:18:41.455 --> 01:18:44.391
maybe you oughta venture out a
bit.

01:18:45.392 --> 01:18:47.294
That's all I'm thinking.

01:18:56.370 --> 01:18:59.039
(country music)

01:19:01.842 --> 01:19:04.378
(people cheering)
(food sizzling)

01:19:25.232 --> 01:19:27.901
(country music)

01:19:36.243 --> 01:19:37.209
- Paw-paw!

01:19:37.211 --> 01:19:39.444
- Oh, who's that yelling at me?

01:19:39.446 --> 01:19:42.114
Hey, Betsey-girl, how you doing?

01:19:42.116 --> 01:19:43.482
- Mom said we can play games.

01:19:43.484 --> 01:19:45.017
- Oh, she did, did she?

01:19:45.019 --> 01:19:45.984
- (laughs) Hey, dad.

01:19:45.986 --> 01:19:47.819
- Hey, how you doing? Is your
mom coming?

01:19:47.821 --> 01:19:49.388
- No, it's Sunday.

01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:51.290
Lord forbid she have some
fun with her granddaughter.

01:19:51.292 --> 01:19:53.158
- That's okay, more for me!

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.595
- (laughs) I told Betsey
you'd play games with her.

01:19:55.597 --> 01:19:56.428
- Where are you going?

01:19:56.430 --> 01:19:57.329
- Nowhere.

Hey Bernice, this is Leslie.

01:20:00.401 --> 01:20:02.167
Royal hired her on at the hotel,
to host.

Bernice,

01:25:23.725 --> 01:25:26.659
You blew 180,000, you dumb
bitch.

01:25:26.661 --> 01:25:30.696
- 190, and it ain't that much.

01:25:30.698 --> 01:25:31.664
And what about you, Pete?

01:25:31.666 --> 01:25:33.532
When I first met you, you were
fucking 18.

01:25:33.534 --> 01:25:35.935
You were ready to see the world.

01:25:35.937 --> 01:25:38.403
Look at you now.

01:25:38.405 --> 01:25:42.844
You could've did anything,
Pete, but you fucking did this.

01:25:44.879 --> 01:25:46.912
So don't give me your shit.

01:25:46.914 --> 01:25:48.547

just go back

01:25:48.549 --> 01:25:49.414

01:25:49.416 --> 01:25:50.583

- You know what she did,
Sweeney?

01:25:52.319 --> 01:25:53.451
- It's not my business,

01:25:53.453 --> 01:25:54.452
it's not yours to be doing this
here.

01:25:54.454 --> 01:25:55.788
I mean, have some sense,
alright?

01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:58.256
I mean, we're having fun.

01:25:58.258 --> 01:26:01.694
- You oughta know if you're
gonna be laying down with her.

01:26:01.696 --> 01:26:02.728
- Where's Dutch?

01:26:02.730 --> 01:26:03.829
Someone needs to take her home.

01:26:03.831 --> 01:26:06.199
- You know she left her kid?

01:26:08.301 --> 01:26:09.802
- He don't know anything.
- Hey.

01:26:09.804 --> 01:26:11.336
- Hey, hey, hey, no, no,
don't get mad at Royal.

01:26:11.338 --> 01:26:13.238
He's just trying to help you
out.

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:15.407
Did she tell you she
drank all that money away?

01:26:15.409 --> 01:26:17.409
Had every chance, pissed
it down the gutter,

01:26:17.411 --> 01:26:18.110
and her son-
- Nancy.

01:26:18.112 --> 01:26:19.912
- Left him, no note, nothing.

01:26:19.914 --> 01:26:21.747
That boy was 13.

01:26:21.749 --> 01:26:23.716
Ain't have food, he's just
scared.

01:26:23.718 --> 01:26:25.618
He's all alone without his mama.

01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:28.386
Just so you could go out
drinking,
thinking you're hot shit.

01:26:28.388 --> 01:26:29.320
- That ain't fucking true.

01:26:29.322 --> 01:26:31.289
- Good Christian people raised
you right.

01:26:31.291 --> 01:26:33.358
And you ruined that sweet boy's
life.

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:36.261
- And what did you do to fucking
stop me?!

01:26:36.263 --> 01:26:39.732
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:26:39.734 --> 01:26:41.903
- Get her outta here. Bitch.

01:26:48.876 --> 01:26:50.876
- Hey, hey, was all that true?

01:26:50.878 --> 01:26:52.912
- So what? You wanna fire me?

01:26:52.914 --> 01:26:54.580
- Leslie.

01:26:54.582 --> 01:26:55.480
- I don't blame you.

01:26:55.482 --> 01:26:56.347
It's fine. You tried.

01:26:56.349 --> 01:26:57.516
- Just stop.
- I don't blame anyone.

01:26:57.518 --> 01:26:58.853
- Just stop.
- Why?

01:27:00.253 --> 01:27:01.620
I was happy to have a break.

01:27:01.622 --> 01:27:06.025
Okay, I partied and I
didn't mean to spend it all.

01:27:06.027 --> 01:27:08.661
I lost everything and I
had to file for bankruptcy.

01:27:08.663 --> 01:27:10.295
- Okay.
- Fucking everyone hated me.

01:27:10.297 --> 01:27:11.764
I lost my place.

01:27:11.766 --> 01:27:14.567
And so yeah, I left him.

01:27:14.569 --> 01:27:15.568
- [Sweeney] Okay.

01:27:15.570 --> 01:27:16.902
- I left him.

01:27:16.904 --> 01:27:20.271
- Okay, let me just say
bye and I'll drive you.

01:27:20.273 --> 01:27:21.339
[Sweeney] Yeah.

01:27:21.341 --> 01:27:23.878
- Hey, it's fine.

01:27:24.879 --> 01:27:29.550

should be alone, Leslie.

- What's that?

01:28:27.642 --> 01:28:30.876
- Do you mind if I lift your
spirits?

01:28:30.878 --> 01:28:33.378
Got a buddy who works down at
the station,

01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:35.016
and he dug this up for me.

01:28:37.417 --> 01:28:38.684
- [Newsman] And it was
here at Obe's honky ton-

01:28:38.686 --> 01:28:39.752
- Look at you.

01:28:39.754 --> 01:28:41.887

picked the winning numbers

01:28:41.889 --> 01:28:44.455
which after taxes, will
be sending her home

01:28:44.457 --> 01:28:45.825
with a life-changing sum of
money.

01:28:45.827 --> 01:28:48.994
- Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

01:28:48.996 --> 01:28:51.096
- Leslie, how does it feel?
(Sweeney laughs)

01:28:51.098 --> 01:28:54.432
- Well, I feel helluvalot
better than yesterday. (laughs)

01:28:54.434 --> 01:28:56.068
- I understand that you had a
little help

01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:56.936
picking the winning numbers?

01:28:56.938 --> 01:28:59.104
- I picked the same ones I
always do.

01:28:59.106 --> 01:29:00.405
- [Newsman] And that
was your son's birthday?

01:29:00.407 --> 01:29:01.640
- Yeah, James, my son James.

01:29:01.642 --> 01:29:02.541
You wanna meet him?

01:29:02.543 --> 01:29:03.374
- [Newsman] Sure.
- Okay.

01:29:03.376 --> 01:29:05.044
James! Come here.

01:29:05.046 --> 01:29:06.545
This is my boy.

01:29:06.547 --> 01:29:08.647
Yeah, he's twice as lucky, half
as cute.

01:29:08.649 --> 01:29:09.480
- [Newsman] And what do you plan
to do

01:29:09.482 --> 01:29:11.917
with 190,000 smackeroos?

01:29:11.919 --> 01:29:12.985
- God, I don't know.

01:29:12.987 --> 01:29:17.056
Maybe by a house, buy
something nice for my boy.

01:29:17.058 --> 01:29:18.824
Just have a better life!

01:29:18.826 --> 01:29:19.758
- [Nancy] Hey, Lee, what about
us?

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:20.860
- [Friends] What about us?

01:29:20.862 --> 01:29:22.460
- Drinks are on me!

01:29:22.462 --> 01:29:24.763
(crowd cheers)

01:29:24.765 --> 01:29:26.665
- [Newsman] And you James,
is there something special

01:29:26.667 --> 01:29:28.100
that momma owes you now?

01:29:28.102 --> 01:29:29.969
- What? Being born ain't enough?

01:29:29.971 --> 01:29:32.137
- A guitar, so I can be the next
Waylon.

01:29:32.139 --> 01:29:33.839
- [Friends] Oh, yeah.

01:29:33.841 --> 01:29:36.041
(Leslie cheers)

01:29:36.043 --> 01:29:38.544
- And I want her to open a
diner.

01:29:38.546 --> 01:29:39.745
She always wanted a diner.

01:29:39.747 --> 01:29:42.014
- Hey, well, would you call it
Leslie's?

01:29:42.016 --> 01:29:43.549
(Leslie scoffs)

01:29:43.551 --> 01:29:45.651
Well, I hope to be there on
opening day.

01:29:45.653 --> 01:29:49.622
- Well, we're looking
forward to ya. (cheers)

01:29:49.624 --> 01:29:52.758
- Alright, well, from all
of us at Channel 10 News;

01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:54.026
here's to Leslie!

01:29:54.028 --> 01:29:56.128
We wish you all the best.

01:29:56.130 --> 01:29:58.165
(Leslie cheers)

01:30:00.534 --> 01:30:01.901
- Oh, I'm gonna watch that
again, you look so good!

01:30:01.903 --> 01:30:03.669
- No, no.

01:30:03.671 --> 01:30:05.204
- Just gonna rewind it.

01:30:05.206 --> 01:30:08.540
- I said I don't wanna
watch it again, goddammit.

01:30:08.542 --> 01:30:10.042
I said no, if you just
listened the first time,

01:30:10.044 --> 01:30:12.912
then you wouldn't get your
feelings hurt.

01:30:12.914 --> 01:30:14.414
- I just thought it'd be nice
to...

01:30:17.151 --> 01:30:19.084
- Get out.

01:30:19.086 --> 01:30:20.052
- Hey, come on, I just
thought it'd be nice

01:30:20.054 --> 01:30:22.888
if we watch it together just to
remind you

01:30:22.890 --> 01:30:24.590
that you're not the piece of
shit

01:30:24.592 --> 01:30:26.191
that everybody says you are.

01:30:26.193 --> 01:30:29.762
Right, what I saw was a
good mama loving on her boy,

01:30:29.764 --> 01:30:31.230
but I guess I wasn't thinking.

01:30:31.232 --> 01:30:33.666
- No, you weren't thinking.

01:30:33.668 --> 01:30:37.836
You're shoving your way into
my life and you know what?

01:30:37.838 --> 01:30:40.808
It's my life.

01:30:42.977 --> 01:30:45.811
Jesus Christ, this fucking week!

01:30:45.813 --> 01:30:47.246
- Well, I'm sorry I got
the fucking tape thing.

01:30:47.248 --> 01:30:49.884
- Don't you fucking swear at me!

01:31:01.929 --> 01:31:02.763
He --

01:31:04.031 --> 01:31:06.701
He ain't never gonna speak to me
again.

01:31:08.769 --> 01:31:10.803
My folks don't wanna fucking
speak to me,

01:31:10.805 --> 01:31:15.643
and everyone in town tries
to avoid me like the plague,

01:31:16.143 --> 01:31:20.179
and my boy doesn't wanna see me.

01:31:20.181 --> 01:31:22.781
And I'm fucking stuck
here with you and Royal,

01:31:22.783 --> 01:31:27.186
pair of fucking hilljacks
like the shit icing

01:31:27.188 --> 01:31:28.954
on my shit fucking life.

01:31:28.956 --> 01:31:30.689
Ya know?

01:31:30.691 --> 01:31:32.591
- Me and Royal are the best
thing that happened to you.

01:31:32.593 --> 01:31:34.228
So don't call us names.

01:31:35.696 --> 01:31:37.162
And your family won't talk to
you

01:31:37.164 --> 01:31:41.000
because they shouldn't after
what you did.

01:31:41.002 --> 01:31:42.970
But you're living, right?

01:31:44.839 --> 01:31:45.771
(Leslie laughs)

01:31:45.773 --> 01:31:48.273
I'm sorry it ain't a fairy tale.

01:31:48.275 --> 01:31:50.175
We all should have done
things differently.

01:31:50.177 --> 01:31:54.715
But you're what's wrong with
your life, not anyone else.

01:32:00.187 --> 01:32:01.088
- Fuck you.

01:32:02.757 --> 01:32:03.591
- Okay

01:32:05.259 --> 01:32:07.960
Alright, just sit down, Leslie.

01:32:07.962 --> 01:32:09.628
Fuck you.

01:32:09.630 --> 01:32:12.166
Come on, let's just talk about
it.

01:32:14.602 --> 01:32:16.602
Where are you gonna go?
What are you gonna do?

01:32:16.604 --> 01:32:18.103
I know where you're gonna go.

01:32:18.105 --> 01:32:19.671
And everything you did to get
better

01:32:19.673 --> 01:32:21.242
is just gonna be gone.

01:32:22.576 --> 01:32:25.012
- Well, it ain't you're concern.

01:32:28.215 --> 01:32:29.984
'Cause I fucking quit!

01:32:45.666 --> 01:32:47.568
(coin into slot)

01:32:50.204 --> 01:32:52.139
(touchtones)

01:32:57.812 --> 01:33:00.314
(phone ringing)

01:33:05.786 --> 01:33:07.619
- [Operator] Hello, no one is
available

01:33:07.621 --> 01:33:09.221
to take your call at this time.

01:33:09.223 --> 01:33:11.123
Please leave a message after the
tone.

01:33:11.125 --> 01:33:13.025
(phone beeps)

01:33:13.027 --> 01:33:14.295
- James, it's me.

01:33:19.266 --> 01:33:22.868
I'm so sorry for what I did to
you.

01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:25.172
I love you so much, and uh...

01:33:34.248 --> 01:33:36.083
I love you sweetie.

01:33:59.206 --> 01:34:01.876
(country music)

01:34:11.185 --> 01:34:13.654
(latin music)

01:34:25.332 --> 01:34:27.968
(rock music)

01:34:34.808 --> 01:34:37.278
(country music)

01:34:47.188 --> 01:34:48.022
How much?

01:34:49.456 --> 01:34:53.027
- [Bert] Seven, but for
you we'll say seven.

01:35:01.769 --> 01:35:04.872
- I think drinking alone's a
mortal sin.

01:35:09.410 --> 01:35:11.378
We toasting to something?

01:35:12.746 --> 01:35:13.881
- Nothing good.

01:35:21.755 --> 01:35:22.389
(laughs)

01:35:24.959 --> 01:35:28.429
You are gorgeous.

01:35:31.232 --> 01:35:32.933
- I'll drink to that.

01:35:34.935 --> 01:35:35.803
- Go ahead.

01:35:37.137 --> 01:35:39.807
(glasses clink)

01:35:44.011 --> 01:35:46.046
Why did you come and talk to me?

01:35:48.782 --> 01:35:50.449
- What do you mean?

01:35:50.451 --> 01:35:52.884
- Did you see something in me
you like?

01:35:52.886 --> 01:35:56.156
- I do. Me, in about an hour.

01:35:58.892 --> 01:36:00.227
- Oh, that's good.

01:36:04.498 --> 01:36:08.202
- If you ain't interested,
you just say so, lady.

01:36:09.169 --> 01:36:10.771
- Come on, tell me.

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:16.542
Did you see something special in
me?

01:36:16.544 --> 01:36:18.912
Or did you see a sure thing?

01:36:20.281 --> 01:36:21.882
- I think you're...

01:36:24.285 --> 01:36:28.053
I think I'm waiting on someone
else.

01:36:28.055 --> 01:36:32.159
- Lots of fun until I got
something on my mind, huh?

01:36:37.164 --> 01:36:40.899
- I guess, I can talk to you if
you want.

01:36:40.901 --> 01:36:42.568
- Oh, I bet you can talk real
good.

01:36:42.570 --> 01:36:45.973
I bet you can tell me how
beautiful I am.

01:36:47.609 --> 01:36:49.276
- If you want.

01:36:56.317 --> 01:36:58.152
- Tell me I'm good.

01:37:12.399 --> 01:37:14.902
Tell me I ain't a piece of shit.

01:37:17.938 --> 01:37:19.206
- You ain't.

01:37:21.208 --> 01:37:22.577
You're good.

01:37:27.948 --> 01:37:30.516
- You got a car, mister?

01:37:30.518 --> 01:37:33.521
(car engine revving)

01:37:46.568 --> 01:37:48.066
- Well, where did she go?

01:37:48.068 --> 01:37:50.102
- How the hell I know, Sweeney?

01:37:50.104 --> 01:37:51.038
- Goddammit!

01:37:52.106 --> 01:37:54.272
- Sweeney, how are you?

01:37:54.274 --> 01:37:55.608
- Get out of my way.

01:37:55.610 --> 01:37:57.008
- If you're looking for
Lee, this is the place.

01:37:57.010 --> 01:37:58.310
- What is wrong with you, woman?

01:37:58.312 --> 01:38:01.146
- You ain't gonna change her.

01:38:01.148 --> 01:38:02.615
- Just get out of my way, Pete.

01:38:02.617 --> 01:38:04.684
- Why don't you get out of my
way?

01:38:04.686 --> 01:38:05.951
- Watch it, boy.

01:38:05.953 --> 01:38:07.520
- This boy'll whoop your ass.

01:38:07.522 --> 01:38:09.955
(men grunting)

01:38:09.957 --> 01:38:11.990
- Hit him!
- Goddammit!

01:38:11.992 --> 01:38:13.561
- Hit him, Pete. Hit him.

01:38:14.928 --> 01:38:16.261
- Damn it, get!

01:38:16.263 --> 01:38:18.997
Shit! I'll kill him!

01:38:18.999 --> 01:38:20.465
- You ain't gonna do
shit, you little pissant.

01:38:20.467 --> 01:38:21.701
Sit down and shut up.

01:38:21.703 --> 01:38:23.168
- Fuck you!

01:38:23.170 --> 01:38:25.070
Fuck all y'all, I was
standing up for y'all

01:38:25.072 --> 01:38:26.371
- Guess what y'all? Next round's
on Pete!

01:38:26.373 --> 01:38:27.707
(people cheering)

01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:30.976
- Yeah, drink your Coors
Light on me, assholes!

01:38:30.978 --> 01:38:32.212
- Hey Bert,

01:38:33.347 --> 01:38:35.113
if she ain't coming back,

01:38:35.115 --> 01:38:38.952
you mind if I give these
lovely children a home?

01:38:56.370 --> 01:38:59.940
(howling)

01:39:07.181 --> 01:39:09.483
(soft music)

01:39:28.101 --> 01:39:30.672
(fast breathing)

01:39:37.478 --> 01:39:40.481
(car engine revving)

01:40:01.268 --> 01:40:04.004
(car door shuts)

01:40:15.650 --> 01:40:18.385
(Sweeney knocks)

01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:42.677
(birds chirping)

01:41:01.461 --> 01:41:04.331
(car horn honking)

01:41:10.872 --> 01:41:13.238
Goddamn it, woman!

01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:14.406
- Have you been drinking?

01:41:14.408 --> 01:41:15.841
- No.

01:41:15.843 --> 01:41:16.809
- Well, I don't even know
what you think you're doing

01:41:16.811 --> 01:41:18.611
because there's no conversation
between us

01:41:18.613 --> 01:41:19.712
till you start apologizing.

01:41:19.714 --> 01:41:21.881
- I want the ice cream shop.

01:41:21.883 --> 01:41:23.481
- What? That?

01:41:23.483 --> 01:41:24.784
[Leslie] Mmhmm

01:41:24.786 --> 01:41:26.184
- I spent too much of my life

01:41:26.186 --> 01:41:27.352
hiding with people I don't even
know.

01:41:27.354 --> 01:41:28.320
And I'm done with hiding

01:41:28.322 --> 01:41:31.759
and I'm sure as shit
done with being run off.

01:41:33.828 --> 01:41:35.528
- So you're gonna live in there?

01:41:35.530 --> 01:41:38.129
- I'm gonna make something out
of it and you're gonna help!

01:41:38.131 --> 01:41:39.065
- Why are you yelling at me?

01:41:39.067 --> 01:41:42.467
- Because I'm excited! Get me a
hammer!

01:41:42.469 --> 01:41:43.536
- Wait, you think you can
just tell me what to do

01:41:43.538 --> 01:41:44.369
after you called me names-

01:41:44.371 --> 01:41:45.671
- Get me a hammer.

01:41:45.673 --> 01:41:46.507
- Okay.

01:41:49.242 --> 01:41:53.512
(door opens)
(door closes)

01:41:53.514 --> 01:41:56.716
- (grunts) Watch out!

01:41:56.718 --> 01:41:59.652
- [Sweeney] Oh, watch out for
nails.

01:41:59.654 --> 01:42:01.754
- Alright, this is it.

01:42:01.756 --> 01:42:02.688
- [Sweeney] You need help?

01:42:02.690 --> 01:42:06.592
- No, I got it. (sighs)

01:42:06.594 --> 01:42:08.594
You know this is Royal's
daddy's, right?

01:42:08.596 --> 01:42:09.695
- [Sweeney] Yeah.
- He thought it'd

01:42:09.697 --> 01:42:12.898
be a real hit with the
kids, but didn't work out.

01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:15.200
Now it's just been sitting
here, like, 40 years

01:42:15.202 --> 01:42:17.369
just waiting for someone to give
it shot.

01:42:17.371 --> 01:42:20.673
- Yeah, like a tetanus
shot or a hepatitis shot.

01:42:20.675 --> 01:42:23.676
(both laugh)

01:42:23.678 --> 01:42:27.780
Look, I saw that video and I
know you're excited about this,

01:42:27.782 --> 01:42:29.949
but I mean, what do you know

01:42:29.951 --> 01:42:32.217
about running a place like this?

01:42:32.219 --> 01:42:34.954
- Well, what'd you know
about running a motel?

01:42:34.956 --> 01:42:36.221
- No, I'm serious, alright?

01:42:36.223 --> 01:42:37.923
I mean, unless you're hiding
some

01:42:37.925 --> 01:42:39.558
other jackpot somewhere,

01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:42.193
I mean, you gotta get a
fryer, you gotta get a grill.

01:42:42.195 --> 01:42:43.663
That's expensive.

01:42:43.665 --> 01:42:47.232
And then you gotta hire a
cook and you gotta make menus,

01:42:47.234 --> 01:42:48.266
you gotta get a soda
machine, you gotta get-

01:42:48.268 --> 01:42:52.470
- Hey, that's very good,
do you wanna work here?

01:42:52.472 --> 01:42:55.841
- All right. I mean, I
understand that you're excited,

01:42:55.843 --> 01:42:58.577
but honestly, how are you
planning on paying for this?

01:42:58.579 --> 01:43:00.846
I mean, you can't ask us
for a raise 'cause we can't,

01:43:00.848 --> 01:43:03.250
we don't have it.

01:43:04.919 --> 01:43:05.753
What?

01:43:07.354 --> 01:43:09.590
- I'm gonna move in with you.

01:43:11.659 --> 01:43:12.527
I can save.

01:43:14.494 --> 01:43:16.329
I can work on weekends.

01:43:18.666 --> 01:43:22.302
Hey, it might take 10
years, but let's do it.

01:43:26.306 --> 01:43:26.941
- Okay.

01:43:30.745 --> 01:43:32.812
- Yeah? (laughs)

01:43:32.814 --> 01:43:34.816
- Well, I mean, I gotta ask
Royal.

01:43:37.985 --> 01:43:40.586
- But you gonna ask him?

01:43:40.588 --> 01:43:43.791
- Yeah, yeah, I'll ask him.

01:43:46.293 --> 01:43:47.562
- Damn

01:43:49.496 --> 01:43:51.431
Why are you so good to me?

01:43:52.633 --> 01:43:53.968
- Well

01:43:55.603 --> 01:43:59.272
I think it's pretty obvious by
now.

01:44:08.616 --> 01:44:10.783
(soft music)

01:44:10.785 --> 01:44:12.952
Okay.
(Leslie chuckles)

01:44:12.954 --> 01:44:14.820
So we got work to do?

01:44:14.822 --> 01:44:17.288
- Later.
- Okay. (laughs)

01:44:17.290 --> 01:44:20.427
(soft music continues)

01:44:21.461 --> 01:44:23.998
(birds chirping)

01:44:25.398 --> 01:44:27.969
(train chugging)

01:44:46.386 --> 01:44:48.888
Alright, floors are lookin'
good.

01:44:48.890 --> 01:44:50.823
- I don't know, I think
we should mop em again.

01:44:50.825 --> 01:44:52.091
- Oh, you're stalling.

01:44:52.093 --> 01:44:53.893
Royal, we're doing this!

01:44:53.895 --> 01:44:56.629
- I'm shakin' like a goddamn
leaf.

01:44:56.631 --> 01:44:58.898
- Still think we shoulda
called the place "Royal's."

01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:01.000
Put on some costumes, do it up
big.

01:45:01.002 --> 01:45:03.836
- I ain't dressing up
like a goddamn princess.

01:45:03.838 --> 01:45:05.638
- I know, a couple of
knights and a bridge troll.

01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:06.705
I like it.

01:45:06.707 --> 01:45:07.673
- People like themes.

01:45:07.675 --> 01:45:09.440
- I said no, okay? Shut up.

01:45:09.442 --> 01:45:12.578
(Sweeney laughs)

01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:14.982
(door unlocks)

01:45:17.552 --> 01:45:20.351
(all cheering)

01:45:20.353 --> 01:45:21.854
- (claps) Here we go.

01:45:21.856 --> 01:45:22.721
- Order up!

01:45:22.723 --> 01:45:23.589
- Here we go.

01:45:23.591 --> 01:45:24.523
(Royal laughs)

01:45:24.525 --> 01:45:27.458
- Well, it's pretty quiet.

01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:28.527
- We've been open a minute,

01:45:28.529 --> 01:45:29.362
not even.

01:45:30.363 --> 01:45:33.100
(crickets chirping)

01:45:37.839 --> 01:45:38.673
Fuck 'em.

01:45:40.608 --> 01:45:42.508
- Well, I don't know why
I'm doing this, anyway.

01:45:42.510 --> 01:45:44.045
Why it even matters.

01:45:45.012 --> 01:45:47.012
- They're just being mean.

01:45:47.014 --> 01:45:48.747
They'll have to eat.

01:45:48.749 --> 01:45:50.785
They'll come, they'll see.

01:45:52.019 --> 01:45:55.790
- (sighs) I need a cigarette.

01:46:22.717 --> 01:46:25.684
(door opens)
(door closes)

01:46:25.686 --> 01:46:28.623
(crickets chirping)

01:46:32.126 --> 01:46:33.661
(taps flask)

01:47:00.888 --> 01:47:02.690
(inhales deeply)

01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:07.795
(exhales)

01:47:43.130 --> 01:47:45.166
(door opens)
(door closes)

01:47:51.605 --> 01:47:52.571
We're closing up!

01:47:52.573 --> 01:47:54.907
What the...

01:47:54.909 --> 01:47:58.077
(car engine revving)

01:47:58.079 --> 01:48:00.746
- Oh, here we go, it's about
time.

01:48:00.748 --> 01:48:02.581
Royal, we got one.

01:48:02.583 --> 01:48:04.049
- [Leslie] Well, tell 'em we're
closed.

01:48:04.051 --> 01:48:05.584
- Lee, it's a customer.

01:48:05.586 --> 01:48:09.254
- No, they've had all day, I'm
going home.

01:48:09.256 --> 01:48:11.590
- Hey, Lee.
- What?

01:48:11.592 --> 01:48:13.995
- Maybe you oughta slip out the
back.

01:48:20.001 --> 01:48:21.734
I'll take care of it.

01:48:21.736 --> 01:48:22.835
- You go to the back.

01:48:22.837 --> 01:48:24.236
- No, I got it, it's fine.

01:48:24.238 --> 01:48:26.572
- Go on.
- [Sweeney] No, I got it.

01:48:26.574 --> 01:48:27.208
Go on.

01:48:28.642 --> 01:48:29.308
- Okay.

01:48:29.310 --> 01:48:30.277
- Take this.

01:48:36.650 --> 01:48:39.251
Welcome to Lee's, how can I help
you?

01:48:39.253 --> 01:48:40.753
(door closes)

01:48:40.755 --> 01:48:42.321
- Two please.

01:48:42.323 --> 01:48:43.858
- Just right here.

01:48:44.992 --> 01:48:46.692
- What's wrong with a table?

01:48:46.694 --> 01:48:49.563
- Well, that's reserved. For
members.

01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:55.834
So will Dutch be joining you
tonight?

01:48:55.836 --> 01:48:57.136
- No.
- Okay.

01:48:57.138 --> 01:48:59.038
Well, I'll just get a menu for
you then

01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:00.274
I'll just...

01:49:02.743 --> 01:49:05.244
You're a little late,
so you wanna be quick

01:49:05.246 --> 01:49:06.245
before we close the grill.

01:49:06.247 --> 01:49:10.783
- Lee, you wanna pull
it back just a little?

01:49:10.785 --> 01:49:12.253
- You did it, Nance.

01:49:13.687 --> 01:49:15.821
No one came.

01:49:15.823 --> 01:49:18.824
Congratulations, you
sure fucking showed me.

01:49:18.826 --> 01:49:19.558
- Little girl-

01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:21.593
- I mean, Jesus fucking Christ,

01:49:21.595 --> 01:49:23.629
couldn't you done this like a
year ago?

01:49:23.631 --> 01:49:24.963
You watched me do all this

01:49:24.965 --> 01:49:28.667
knowing you're gonna take it
away from me.

01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:30.704
We was family.

01:49:34.742 --> 01:49:37.778
How fucking mean are you?

01:49:44.318 --> 01:49:46.821
- I'm sorry for what happened.

01:49:49.790 --> 01:49:52.259
Do you hear me? I'm sorry.

01:49:55.396 --> 01:49:59.033
And you were right, I
could have stopped you.

01:50:00.868 --> 01:50:02.367
I saw what was happening,

01:50:02.369 --> 01:50:04.872
I could have stopped it and I
didn't.

01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:08.375
'Cause I was having fun.

01:50:12.413 --> 01:50:15.247
But for all the nights you
made me hold that little boy,

01:50:15.249 --> 01:50:18.050
all the times you made a liar
out of me

01:50:18.052 --> 01:50:19.852
when I was the only one telling
him,

01:50:19.854 --> 01:50:21.086
"Don't you listen to them
people.

01:50:21.088 --> 01:50:22.354
I know your mama.

01:50:22.356 --> 01:50:25.924
She loves you too much
to do you like this."

01:50:25.926 --> 01:50:27.426
You shouldn't have left.

01:50:27.428 --> 01:50:30.195
I don't care how bad you fucked
up, how stupid you looked,

01:50:30.197 --> 01:50:31.396
that little boy loved you.

01:50:31.398 --> 01:50:32.299
We all did.

01:50:36.270 --> 01:50:38.237
I ain't never gonna forgive you
for that.

01:50:38.239 --> 01:50:40.672
And I don't ask you to forgive
me,

01:50:40.674 --> 01:50:43.644
but I think we've all
done enough suffering.

01:50:52.019 --> 01:50:52.953
- Thank you.

01:50:58.092 --> 01:50:58.926
- Yeah.

01:51:04.698 --> 01:51:06.265
Now

01:51:06.267 --> 01:51:08.102
wipe your face and

01:51:10.037 --> 01:51:10.838
turn your head.

01:51:12.406 --> 01:51:13.240
- What?

01:51:21.148 --> 01:51:22.917
Oh my God.

01:51:24.018 --> 01:51:25.717
I'll take two of them specials
and

01:51:25.719 --> 01:51:27.953
I'd appreciate it if
you didn't spit in 'em.

01:51:27.955 --> 01:51:30.055
- Two specials, hold the spit.

01:51:30.057 --> 01:51:30.923
- Are you okay?

01:51:30.925 --> 01:51:32.191
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:51:32.193 --> 01:51:34.461
(door opens)

01:51:41.068 --> 01:51:42.935
(door closes)

01:51:42.937 --> 01:51:44.405
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:51:54.248 --> 01:51:55.914
- I guess I'll sit here.

01:51:55.916 --> 01:51:57.318
- Sure, yeah.

01:52:02.356 --> 01:52:03.855
(door swings opens)

01:52:03.857 --> 01:52:05.359
- Hey, how you doing?

01:52:06.327 --> 01:52:08.093
Sweeney.

01:52:08.095 --> 01:52:09.428
- James, nice to meet you.

01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:11.398
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

01:52:13.234 --> 01:52:16.868
So did you drive all the way
down here?

01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:17.504
- I did.

01:52:20.407 --> 01:52:21.242
- Okay.

01:52:23.143 --> 01:52:25.010
Are you hungry?

01:52:25.012 --> 01:52:26.011
- I am.

01:52:26.013 --> 01:52:27.479
Okay, alright.

01:52:27.481 --> 01:52:31.316
Well, I'm just gonna fix this
fryer,

01:52:31.318 --> 01:52:32.985
but maybe we can chat it up
later.

01:52:32.987 --> 01:52:34.152
What do you think?

01:52:34.154 --> 01:52:35.523
- Yeah.
- Alright.

01:52:36.824 --> 01:52:38.190
Just made that pot of coffee.

01:52:38.192 --> 01:52:39.326
- Okay, thanks.

01:52:44.131 --> 01:52:45.565
- Well, would you like some
coffee?

01:52:45.567 --> 01:52:49.001
- Please.
- Yeah, okay.

01:52:49.003 --> 01:52:51.136
It's nice and hot.

01:52:51.138 --> 01:52:52.406
Makes it good.

01:52:54.908 --> 01:52:56.041
Sugar's here.

01:52:56.043 --> 01:52:58.277
- Alright, thanks.

01:52:58.279 --> 01:52:59.144
- Thank you.

01:52:59.146 --> 01:53:01.815
(Leslie laughs)

01:53:07.121 --> 01:53:07.953
(bell chimes)

01:53:07.955 --> 01:53:10.858
- Okay, two specials comin' in
hot.

01:53:12.459 --> 01:53:14.194
- Okay, pasta fazool.

01:53:24.305 --> 01:53:25.337
- You got any silverware?

01:53:25.339 --> 01:53:26.440
- Oh God, yes.

01:53:30.144 --> 01:53:30.978
Got it.

01:53:35.550 --> 01:53:37.182
I'll just leave you to it.

01:53:37.184 --> 01:53:38.984
This is salt and pepper.

01:53:38.986 --> 01:53:40.120
- Yeah, thanks.

01:54:07.414 --> 01:54:08.248
Mom.

01:54:09.483 --> 01:54:10.317
- Yeah?

01:54:12.654 --> 01:54:13.887
- It's great.

01:54:28.536 --> 01:54:30.104
I missed you, baby...

01:54:32.574 --> 01:54:34.406
I've got pasta on my shirt.

01:54:34.408 --> 01:54:37.309
(both laugh)

01:54:37.311 --> 01:54:39.378
Oh, God, I missed you.

01:54:39.380 --> 01:54:40.613
(soft guitar music)

01:54:40.615 --> 01:54:41.448
- Yeah.

01:54:42.983 --> 01:54:44.216
- Oh, baby.

01:54:44.218 --> 01:54:47.988
(soft guitar music continues)

01:54:54.194 --> 01:54:56.995
