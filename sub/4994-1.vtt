even add Huntsville.

<i>So you got to put</i>
<i>something else in it.</i>

11:55.580 --> 11:59.710
The blues is not about
people knowing you.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.980
It's about
you knowing people.

12:02.250 --> 12:06.550
<i>(Train whistle blowing)</i>

12:06.750 --> 12:07.720
(patting)

12:18.900 --> 12:20.670
Who done that
to you, huh?

12:21.000 --> 12:23.970
Big old girl like you
letting folks beat on you.

12:26.240 --> 12:28.070
This look like
it might stay forever.

12:28.310 --> 12:30.810
<i>(Liquid pouring)</i>

12:31.150 --> 12:32.910
What you doing fanning yourself around here for?

12:33.250 --> 12:35.180
Shut the door good
on your way out.

12:36.450 --> 12:38.080
Where you going without my sugar, though?

12:44.990 --> 12:46.830
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

12:47.130 --> 12:48.760
What you grinning about,
Blue Goose?

12:49.000 --> 12:50.030
What you know about it?

12:50.260 --> 12:52.060
Same thing you know.

12:52.270 --> 12:54.500
(Chuckles)

12:54.800 --> 12:57.140
What's your name,
pretty lady?

12:57.340 --> 12:58.900
Bessie Smith.

12:59.140 --> 13:00.840
Miss Bessie Smith.

13:02.380 --> 13:03.710
<i>(Music playing)</i>

13:04.110 --> 13:06.180
- So, like we said--
- How many seats in the house?

13:06.450 --> 13:07.980
- 200.
- I counted 250.

13:08.320 --> 13:11.620
Ah, I meant 200 plus,
give or take.

13:11.890 --> 13:13.550
And you sure
eager to take.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.760
- She need to be here?
- Ma: She needs to understand

13:16.120 --> 13:17.620
why TOBA stands
for "Tough On Black Asses."

13:18.060 --> 13:21.760
Actually, it stands for Theater
Owners Booking Association, T-O-B--

13:22.060 --> 13:23.130
- What's the cover?
- <i>A nickel.</i>

13:23.400 --> 13:26.000
Hmm, newspaper ad
say a dime.

13:26.330 --> 13:28.330
- Well, we don't always--
- $12.50.

13:28.700 --> 13:31.070
- Pardon me?
- That's 10 cents times 250 seats.

13:31.370 --> 13:32.840
Our contract
is 50-50 per head.

13:33.140 --> 13:35.470
$12.50 in advance
every night.

13:35.810 --> 13:37.980
(Laughing)
We have no way of knowing

13:38.350 --> 13:39.710
how many people
are actually gonna show up.

13:39.980 --> 13:41.150
We'll refund
your no-shows.

13:41.480 --> 13:43.250
Bessie will be counting
the empty seats.

13:43.420 --> 13:45.220
$12.50.

13:48.690 --> 13:49.990
(Chuckling)

13:50.320 --> 13:51.860
Boy, aren't you getting
a hell of a deal?

13:53.190 --> 13:54.690
Now let's talk about
the bar.

14:03.540 --> 14:05.400
What you standing
way back here for?

14:05.610 --> 14:07.010
Keep on going.

14:11.180 --> 14:13.050
I ain't said stop.

14:17.050 --> 14:18.280
A little bit more.

14:21.220 --> 14:23.090
- Ma.
- <i>That's about right.</i>

14:24.090 --> 14:25.060
Now how that feel?

14:25.290 --> 14:26.930
Like I'm about to fall.

14:27.260 --> 14:29.200
That's how it should feel every night.

14:29.460 --> 14:31.200
If you're not
risking nothing,

14:31.430 --> 14:32.930
neither will they.

14:33.270 --> 14:36.300
Now where's that heifer
that stole your man?

14:36.600 --> 14:39.870
- Ain't nobody here.
- Pick somebody.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.040
Right there.
How about her?

14:42.310 --> 14:44.540
Three rows back
on the left.

14:48.050 --> 14:50.450
- Mm-mmm.
- Yeah.

14:51.950 --> 14:53.050
Yeah, that look
like her.

14:53.390 --> 14:54.790
And what you gotta
say to that bitch?

14:54.990 --> 14:56.420
<i>And right there.</i>

14:56.820 --> 15:00.160
Oh, there's that pinched-back
man that stole all your money.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.230
Yeah, that's him.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.470
Tell them about theyselves.
Go on, baby.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.640
- Bess? We're rehitching.
- Okay.

15:14.840 --> 15:16.240

16:12.130 --> 16:13.900
<i>(Coins clink)</i>

16:14.140 --> 16:15.870
Gin'll make you crazy.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.840
Why don't you let me buy you a whiskey instead?

16:20.880 --> 16:22.810
That "stand and shout" shit
might work back home,

16:23.240 --> 16:27.050
but you got to bring some hoop-de-doo
to get these silly folk attention.

16:27.350 --> 16:28.950
Don't nobody care
what you think.

16:29.250 --> 16:30.920
You don't know nothin'
from nothin'.

16:31.250 --> 16:34.420
Oh, I ain't trying to fuss with you, gorgeous.

16:34.760 --> 16:35.990
Just 'cause you got
a little sport in your strut

16:36.260 --> 16:37.420

no authority.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.990
I was just giving you
my opinion, that's all.

16:41.230 --> 16:42.700

25:17.510 --> 25:19.540
Bessie's doing
big things, man, and...

25:19.850 --> 25:21.380
<i>you on bass,</i>
<i>you on horn.</i>

25:21.780 --> 25:26.350
Next, we have Doreen Dupree
from Hattiesburg, Mississippi.

25:29.120 --> 25:30.920
Is that a real name
or a made-up one?

25:31.260 --> 25:33.090
- Hattiesburg is a real--
- Not Hattiesburg.

25:33.430 --> 25:34.890
I know where in the hell Hattiesburg is.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.100
I'm talking about
"Doreen Dupree."

25:37.460 --> 25:39.500
That sound like some made-up,
store-bought shit to me.

25:39.900 --> 25:41.830
Don't that sound like some old vaudeville mess to you?

25:42.270 --> 25:44.440
Who mama and daddy gonna name
'em something go together like that?

25:44.770 --> 25:46.570
You pick that out of a magazine or something?

25:46.870 --> 25:48.240
It's on
my birth certificate.

25:48.610 --> 25:52.480
They have birth certificates
in Hattiesburg, Mississippi?

25:52.780 --> 25:54.010
And take that damn gum
out your mouth.

25:54.410 --> 25:57.150
Don't nobody wanna see you
up there chewing like a cow.

25:57.580 --> 26:01.090
- Where do I put it?
- Hold it in your damn hand, Hattiesburg.

26:04.090 --> 26:06.930
(Whispers)
Five, six, seven, eight.

26:07.230 --> 26:09.290
Wait, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

26:09.500 --> 26:11.530
What is that?

26:11.770 --> 26:13.270
Um, I'm dancing, ma'am.

26:13.630 --> 26:15.070
- <i>I wanna--</i>
- You better sing something first.

26:15.440 --> 26:17.340
<i>(Stammering)</i>
<i>I don't know how to sing.</i>

26:17.600 --> 26:19.910
You don't know
how to sing?

26:20.270 --> 26:22.510
You wanna be in my show,
you have to be able to sing,

26:22.810 --> 26:25.110
dance, and tell
a damn joke or two.

26:27.750 --> 26:29.550
(Clears throat)

26:29.850 --> 26:31.150
¶ Well, I woke up
this morning-- ¶

26:31.490 --> 26:34.290
That's enough.
Clarence, give her the bag test.

26:37.020 --> 26:38.460
What you grinning for?

26:38.660 --> 26:40.030
You failed.

26:40.430 --> 26:43.200
You must be darker than the bag to be in my show.

26:43.530 --> 26:45.360
Now get going with
your high-heeled ass.

26:45.800 --> 26:49.070
- Next!
- Clarence: <i>Etta Johnson, Bell Buckle, Tennessee.</i>

26:49.300 --> 26:50.940
Bell Buckle?
Lord!

26:51.170 --> 26:53.240
No yellow bitches.

26:53.470 --> 26:55.170
- (Yelps)
- Next!

26:55.540 --> 26:58.980
- Next!
- What if I didn't pass your bag test?

26:59.380 --> 27:03.150
- I never give you no test.
- Oh, you test me... daily.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.290
No, you--
you tell me.

27:08.490 --> 27:10.560
Come on, Lucy.

27:10.720 --> 27:13.330
No.

27:13.530 --> 27:16.260
I wanna know.

27:16.530 --> 27:19.330
Would you still
love me?

27:19.570 --> 27:21.170
You'd still be you.

27:21.470 --> 27:23.170
And how would you
know that?

27:23.400 --> 27:25.570
You know how I feel.

27:29.180 --> 27:30.540
Then I need you
to say it.

27:30.840 --> 27:32.610
- You know.
- No, I don't know.

27:32.810 --> 27:34.250
You know.

27:35.580 --> 27:37.050
Then say it.

27:39.190 --> 27:40.820
It wouldn't matter.

27:41.090 --> 27:42.150
It wouldn't matter,
what?

27:42.490 --> 27:44.520
It wouldn't matter
about your color.

27:47.590 --> 27:49.260
And?

27:49.430 --> 27:51.230
And?

27:53.530 --> 27:54.930
You know what?

28:01.280 --> 28:03.170
I cares for you.

28:04.880 --> 28:07.080
(Chuckles)

28:07.280 --> 28:09.180
You cares for me?

28:10.880 --> 28:13.050
You cares for me.
Is that all?

28:13.290 --> 28:13.990
No, that ain't all.

28:14.350 --> 28:17.360
What-- why you
acting up today?

28:17.620 --> 28:20.230
I need you
to tell me something.

28:20.630 --> 28:24.360
- I'm gonna show you something instead.
- (Laughing)

28:27.200 --> 28:29.100
Clarence: <i>You can make this bigger.</i>
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

28:29.440 --> 28:30.970
<i>It's got to say,</i>
<i>"This is Bessie Smith,"</i>

28:31.440 --> 28:34.540
<i>so make this bigger and this a little bit smaller like that.</i>

28:37.280 --> 28:39.410
Now, that's what-- that's what I'm talkin' about,
right there.

28:39.610 --> 28:41.710
(Chatter)

28:46.050 --> 28:48.120
Clarence:
Come on. All right.

28:50.590 --> 28:51.990
Clarence:
<i>Open your eyes!</i>

28:53.960 --> 28:57.030
- Hey now!
- Clarence: <i>That's right.</i>

28:57.330 --> 28:59.430
<i>Bessie Smith</i>
<i>and Her Down Home Trio.</i>

29:01.840 --> 29:04.340
- Ho-ho, now!
- That's right.

29:04.740 --> 29:06.810
- ¶ I was with you, baby... ¶
- <i>(crowd cheering)</i>

29:07.110 --> 29:11.610
¶ When you didn't
have a dime ¶

29:16.250 --> 29:18.920
¶ I was with you,
baby ¶

29:19.190 --> 29:23.320
¶ When you didn't
have a dime ¶

29:27.460 --> 29:31.230
<i>¶ Now, since you got</i>
<i>plenty of money ¶</i>

29:31.600 --> 29:35.770
¶ You have throwed
your good gal down... ¶

29:36.000 --> 29:38.200
<i>(crowd cheering)</i>

29:41.140 --> 29:43.240
<i>(overlapping voices) This is A.R.</i>
<i>Knight from the "Chicago Defender,"</i>

29:43.610 --> 29:44.640
<i>and I'm here to tell you</i>
<i>that Bessie Smith</i>

29:45.010 --> 29:47.050
<i>is the locomotive</i>

29:47.450 --> 29:49.750
<i>This is W. Alexander</i>
<i>from the "Boston Guardian."</i>

29:50.050 --> 29:51.550
<i>Talk about</i>
<i>"Chattanooga Choo-Choo,"</i>

29:51.950 --> 29:54.490
<i>Bessie Smith is the biggest thing since Ma Rainey.</i>

29:54.960 --> 29:57.560
<i>This is J. Anderson reporting for</i>
<i>the "New York Amsterdam News."</i>

29:58.020 --> 30:00.020
<i>If you haven't got your tickets, folks,</i>
<i>you're not gonna get 'em,</i>

30:00.330 --> 30:01.630
<i>'cause it's already</i>
<i>sold out.</i>

30:01.860 --> 30:03.330
<i>(Knocking on door)</i>

30:11.840 --> 30:13.810
<i>(knocking continues)</i>

30:14.010 --> 30:15.510
Who is it?

30:15.880 --> 30:17.380
Man: <i>I'm here to audition for Miss Bessie Smith.</i>

30:17.810 --> 30:19.810
I didn't ask you what you want,
I asked you who you are.

30:20.150 --> 30:22.150
Man: <i>Open the door and see me,
big man.</i>

30:33.730 --> 30:35.930
My name is Jack Gee, ma'am,
and I'm 32 years old

30:36.360 --> 30:38.760
from Titustown, Virginia,
and I schooled till the 10th grade.

30:39.100 --> 30:40.730
I'm nobody's husband
and I'm nobody's daddy.

30:41.200 --> 30:46.300
I make $13.75 a week working as a
security guard at the five and dime.

30:46.670 --> 30:49.240
Another $2.80 on the weekend at the Top Hat.

30:49.580 --> 30:50.680
<i>I got my own</i>
<i>two-bedroom apartment</i>

30:51.040 --> 30:53.950
<i>and I drive a brand-new</i>
<i>1921 Davis Touring.</i>

30:54.350 --> 30:56.150
Now, I don't believe in church,
but I do believe in God,

30:56.520 --> 30:58.150
and I know it to be
the God's honest truth

30:58.450 --> 30:59.750
that you're
the most beautiful woman

31:00.090 --> 31:05.590
ever sing the blues,
or any woman, period.

31:06.060 --> 31:08.960
And I'm very pleased to make your
acquaintance this fine afternoon.

31:09.230 --> 31:10.730
- Can you sing?
- Oh, yes.

31:10.960 --> 31:12.530
- Can you dance?
- Oh, yes.

31:12.800 --> 31:14.230
Auditions for the show
are over.

31:14.530 --> 31:16.630
I ain't auditioning
for no show.

31:16.940 --> 31:18.640
I'm auditioning
to be your man.

31:18.940 --> 31:20.610
(Scoffs)
You look a little small.

31:20.940 --> 31:23.140
- Baby, I'm built for speed.
- Really, now?

31:23.440 --> 31:25.580
Well, maybe you only
auditions women.

31:26.980 --> 31:30.880
I auditions
whosoever I please.

31:31.220 --> 31:32.680
I can give it
as hard as I can take it,

31:32.950 --> 31:35.920
and I don't mind
going to jail.

31:46.000 --> 31:52.500
- Jack: <i>Mm-mm-mm.</i>
- Woman: <i>¶ Whoa, gone away, baby ¶</i>

31:52.810 --> 31:55.910
<i>¶ Won't be back</i>
<i>till fall ¶</i>

31:56.140 --> 31:58.180
<i>¶ Lord, Lord, Lord ¶</i>

31:58.510 --> 32:02.280
<i>¶ Gone away, baby,</i>
<i>won't be back... ¶</i>

32:02.620 --> 32:04.480
Bottle of gin for the lady
and a glass for me.

32:08.520 --> 32:12.520
<i>¶ If I find me</i>
<i>a good man ¶</i>

32:12.830 --> 32:16.160
<i>¶ I won't be</i>

32:16.500 --> 32:19.200
- (men chuckling)
- Oh, she fine. Man.

32:21.100 --> 32:22.500
Man:
<i>Watch this.</i>

32:24.700 --> 32:27.840
- The lady don't smoke.
- The hell she don't.

32:28.040 --> 32:29.310
(Chuckles)

32:31.980 --> 32:33.580
So that's your man
or what?

32:33.850 --> 32:35.650
No, he's still auditioning.

32:35.850 --> 32:37.820
(Men laughing)

32:38.120 --> 32:40.390
Can I have
this dance, baby?

32:40.720 --> 32:42.450
Touch her hand, Charlie,
and draw back a nub.

32:42.690 --> 32:44.460
And what if I touch his?

32:44.790 --> 32:46.160
- (Knife clicks)
- (Bessie gasps)

32:46.460 --> 32:47.390
- <i>(women scream)</i>

32:53.300 --> 32:54.430
Man:
<i>Hey! Yeah, come here!</i>

32:54.800 --> 32:56.570
- Jack: Come on, girl.
- (Bessie laughing)

32:56.970 --> 32:58.540
- Let's go get 'em, okay?
- Get that motherfucker!

32:58.870 --> 33:00.970
- <i>(Tires screeching)</i>
- (Bessie laughing)

33:01.340 --> 33:03.210
- Chump!
- Bessie: <i>You were so brave, papa!</i>

33:03.510 --> 33:05.180
See how crazy I am
about you, girl!

33:07.980 --> 33:10.250
- Your audition ain't over yet.
- (Honking)

33:10.480 --> 33:11.350

<i>¶ Just when you think</i>
<i>that he's your pal... ¶</i>

33:25.330 --> 33:27.200
Say, we still
$15 short.

33:27.600 --> 33:30.570
- 10 is what everybody gets.
- But we had a contract, sir.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.740
Contract?
You must be one of them old country niggers.

33:33.010 --> 33:34.840
(Chuckling)
Contra--

33:35.110 --> 33:36.980
I'll cut you
every way but loose.

33:37.380 --> 33:40.180
<i>¶ Hug him in the morning,</i>

33:45.750 --> 33:47.550
Bessie: And remember when we
did that show at Don's place?

33:48.020 --> 33:49.520
- Clarence: Ah, you don't remember that.
- Bessie: Oh, lookit.

33:49.790 --> 33:51.620
Lookit, J.G.
That's our corner.

33:52.060 --> 33:54.590
- That's our corner.
- Clarence: A penny a song. (Laughs)

33:55.060 --> 33:56.960
- Woman: I love you, Bessie!
- You see that gin joint right there?

33:57.300 --> 33:59.030
That's where I made
my first whole dollar.

33:59.530 --> 34:02.500
- Spent it, too.
- <i>¶ Hug him in the morning, kiss him every night ¶</i>

34:02.900 --> 34:05.470

Hold out your hand

34:44.340 --> 34:46.409
Keep singing.

34:46.750 --> 34:49.650
Make sure all
you're doing is singing.

34:52.850 --> 34:55.920

35:19.310 --> 35:21.650
Hey y'all. How you doing?
How you doing?

35:42.740 --> 35:47.640
Well, I guess you think
you're something.

35:50.180 --> 35:51.910
How are you?

35:52.080 --> 35:53.680
You care?

35:54.050 --> 35:58.880
I think I'm gonna go show
Jack and Lucille around.

36:12.270 --> 36:13.500
That's your man?

36:16.370 --> 36:18.540
You got something
to eat?

36:18.840 --> 36:22.110
- Drink?
- Oh, city gal, huh?

36:22.510 --> 36:25.940
Can't stand to be in regular
folks' houses no more.

36:33.550 --> 36:34.890
You still keeps
the food locked up.

36:35.090 --> 36:37.290
That's right.

36:37.560 --> 36:40.220
Y'all was like
little rats.

36:40.590 --> 36:42.530
How else was I supposed to
keep the food in the house

36:42.860 --> 36:45.900
- and feed six people?
- Come here.

36:46.230 --> 36:48.700
Go get a case of Coca-Cola
and a lot of ice.

36:49.070 --> 36:52.040
As many potato chips
and peanuts as you can get.

36:52.240 --> 36:55.910
Oh, golly. Mm.

36:56.210 --> 36:59.210
A whole case
of Coca-Cola.

36:59.550 --> 37:03.580
After 10 years,
ain't you a saint?

37:10.260 --> 37:11.390
Don't drink it all up.

37:11.620 --> 37:13.190
You're one to talk.

37:13.590 --> 37:14.960
Well, you're the one still
keeps the food locked up.

37:15.300 --> 37:16.890
Don't look like you're
missing no meals.

37:17.230 --> 37:19.400
Well, I sure didn't
get 'em here, did I?

37:25.170 --> 37:28.170
I got some tickets
for the show tonight.

37:28.470 --> 37:29.540
You want to bring
the family...

37:29.810 --> 37:30.910
I got someplace
else to be.

37:46.190 --> 37:48.660
You been by
Mama's grave yet?

38:04.980 --> 38:07.810
Lucy: No street signs,
no lights, no nothing.

38:08.180 --> 38:09.810
Bessie: Told ya, Mama,
this is Blue Goose Hollow.

I know you remember...

Woman: Easy, papa.
Leave room for the Holy Ghost, now.

38:46.420 --> 38:48.450
Man: Good times with you two.

38:48.820 --> 38:50.690
Woman #2: Girl,
you gotta get your man.

38:50.990 --> 38:53.490
- Hey.
- Leave them gals be.

38:53.730 --> 38:55.860
- Yeah.
- Get off of me.

38:56.230 --> 38:58.160
- What do you think this is?
- I said leave 'em be!

38:58.400 --> 39:00.830
Shut up, fat bitch.

39:01.200 --> 39:02.930
- What'd that fucker say to me?
- I said--

39:03.200 --> 39:04.040
- (thuds)
- (man yells)

39:08.440 --> 39:10.410
- (whistling)
- (cheering)

39:12.010 --> 39:14.450
- (applause)
- Don't nobody try her.

39:14.710 --> 39:17.520
She's in her gin, y'all.

39:33.900 --> 39:36.570
...your little dancer

39:36.870 --> 39:40.000
decided to come along
for the ride.

39:40.240 --> 39:43.340
Y'all know how to ball!

39:43.640 --> 39:46.310
And we're gonna
ball again tomorrow.

39:54.650 --> 39:56.450
Woman:
<i>Clarence, help us.</i>

39:59.090 --> 40:02.130
- Where's a doctor?
- Clarence: <i>Get somebody!</i>

40:04.500 --> 40:07.060
- Get somebody! Hurry up.
- Baby, look at me. Look at me.

40:07.270 --> 40:08.670
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

40:08.840 --> 40:10.370
<i>Help!</i>

Where's Mama?

Jack: <i>It's okay.</i>
<i>It's okay, baby.</i>

- Baby, it's okay.
- Get off of me! Get off of me!

40:53.210 --> 40:55.050
- Get off of me!
- She's okay. She's okay.

40:57.380 --> 40:58.920
- Why did you--
- I'm right here, baby.

40:59.320 --> 41:01.450
- You let her get me.
- I ain't going nowhere, I love you.

41:01.850 --> 41:03.590
Jack <i>You gotta let that heal.</i>
<i>You gotta let that heal.</i>

41:03.990 --> 41:05.990
- Bess, you gotta let that heal.
- We got a show to do.

41:06.360 --> 41:06.990
Clarence: No, no,
ain't no show. Ain't no show.

Lucy: Bess!

<i>(crowd cheering)</i>

41:26.680 --> 41:28.250
How much y'all pay
to get in here?

41:28.510 --> 41:31.920
- Crowd: 25 cents.
- 25 cent?

41:32.290 --> 41:35.790
Hmm, I wouldn't pay 25 cent
to go nowhere.

41:41.530 --> 41:44.230
Well, I guess I better
sing something, huh?

41:44.530 --> 41:47.930
'Cause y'all spent
all that money.

<i>I'm a great admirer</i>

<i>having seen you perform</i>

42:31.740 --> 42:35.050
<i>at the Royal Theater</i>
<i>in Philadelphia.</i>

42:35.410 --> 42:38.180
<i>News of your great talent</i>
<i>continues to precede you</i>

42:38.550 --> 42:40.650
<i>and we would like to invite you</i>
<i>to an audition</i>

42:41.050 --> 42:43.250
<i>at our offices in Times Square,</i>
<i>New York City,</i>

42:43.720 --> 42:47.060
to be our first recording artist
signed to the Black Swan label!

42:47.360 --> 42:49.030
- Hoo!
- Well, this is it.

42:49.430 --> 42:51.300
I always wanted to live in New York City,
you know.

42:51.700 --> 42:52.630
You're gonna be the biggest
thing since Mamie Smith.

42:53.030 --> 42:53.960
You know how many records
she sold last year?

42:54.300 --> 42:56.470
- Bessie: A million.
- A colored outfit?

42:56.770 --> 42:58.370
Ain't nobody heard of
no Black Swan.

42:58.740 --> 43:00.970
<i>What you need is a national label.</i>
<i>Big-time.</i>

43:01.370 --> 43:03.040
W.E.B. Du Bois' company
wants to record you, sis.

43:03.280 --> 43:04.980
This is the big time!

43:05.380 --> 43:07.510
- So? I read his book.
- I doubt you read his book.

43:07.750 --> 43:09.350
I read the damn book.

43:09.780 --> 43:12.150
- What's that got to do with music?
- This is the big ticket.

43:12.550 --> 43:14.590
Bessie, this is what they're
calling Pan-Africanism.

43:14.890 --> 43:16.090
Well, what about
Pan-Americanism?

43:16.460 --> 43:18.660
Can she sell more tickets?
That's what I wanna know.

43:18.960 --> 43:20.890
"The only genuine
colored records.

43:21.230 --> 43:23.390
The others are only
passing for colored."

43:23.730 --> 43:25.460
- That's their motto.
- I like that.

43:25.670 --> 43:26.930
I like it, too.

43:27.270 --> 43:30.470
"Yours in negritude,
Harry Herbert Pace."

43:30.740 --> 43:32.170
The fuck is negritude?

43:32.470 --> 43:35.070
That means they're real,
real black.

43:35.310 --> 43:36.740
My kind of people.

43:41.010 --> 43:42.980
Talk about passing.

43:43.320 --> 43:45.380
Y'all is fried, dyed,
and laid to the side.

43:45.750 --> 43:47.750
Well, and we are very
excited to be here.

43:48.250 --> 43:50.520
- <i>Very excited.</i>
- We were surprised you could schedule the audition

43:50.860 --> 43:52.190
so quickly given your
busy tour schedule.

43:52.530 --> 43:55.760
We canceled the rest of
our tour to be here.

43:56.200 --> 43:59.000
- Well, that's, uh--
- Well, y'all wanna hear me sing, right?

43:59.270 --> 44:01.570
Yes. Yes, yes,
of course.

44:01.870 --> 44:03.700
Is there anything else
that you need?

44:04.000 --> 44:05.470
I need a little something
for this tea.

44:05.710 --> 44:08.210
Honey, sugar, milk?

44:08.510 --> 44:11.110
Splash of Old Tom
will be just fine.

44:11.340 --> 44:13.710
- "Old Tom"?
- Gin?

44:13.950 --> 44:15.750
I'm sorry, I-- I--

44:16.150 --> 44:19.620
I don't know that we have any
or where we could find any.

44:19.850 --> 44:21.990
You see, it's, ah...

44:22.360 --> 44:24.050
- I mean, it's illegal.
- Never mind. It's okay.

44:24.290 --> 44:26.060
No, it ain't okay.

44:27.630 --> 44:31.100
You want her at her best,
then give her what she needs.

Oh, it's okay, papa.

45:16.380 --> 45:19.840
while we appreciate your
downhome sound,

45:20.150 --> 45:21.810
we do not feel
that it is a fit

45:22.050 --> 45:23.710
for Black Swan Records.

45:24.020 --> 45:25.320
We have chosen
to record instead

45:25.650 --> 45:28.620
<i>a young lady who</i>
<i>we unanimously agree</i>

45:28.890 --> 45:31.890
<i>has a more</i>
<i>compatible sound</i>

45:32.190 --> 45:33.720
<i>and is a bright,</i>
<i>shining example</i>

45:34.130 --> 45:36.390
<i>of the Harlem Renaissance</i>
<i>and an uplift to the race.</i>

45:36.660 --> 45:38.500
<i>We hope you can appreciate</i>

45:38.800 --> 45:40.160
<i>the difficulty</i>
<i>of our decision</i>

45:40.500 --> 45:42.030
<i>and the choices</i>
<i>that must be made</i>

45:42.300 --> 45:44.270
<i>in the name of progress.</i>

45:44.570 --> 45:46.070
<i>We remain admirers</i>
<i>of your work</i>

45:46.410 --> 45:47.840
<i>and hope that you will</i>
<i>keep us in mind</i>

<i>for your</i>
<i>future recordings.</i>

- Pour me another glass of this corn.

45:53.880 --> 45:55.210
- Ain't nobody crying.
- It was a good meeting, man.

45:55.510 --> 45:57.150
<i>Hey, baby, look here.</i>
<i>Never again.</i>

45:57.520 --> 45:58.980
Damn fools don't know nothing
about no talent.

45:59.320 --> 46:00.720
I'm gonna get you
a real record deal!

46:01.050 --> 46:01.920
I said I don't wanna
hear no more about it.

46:02.250 --> 46:03.150
<i>What the hell you know</i>
<i>about anything?</i>

46:03.420 --> 46:04.590
We've been in
this business

46:04.990 --> 46:06.360
- before you were wiping your own ass.
- Look it here.

46:06.760 --> 46:09.190
It's about damn time she started
taking advice from a nigger

46:09.500 --> 46:12.060
that don't wear no
stage makeup!

46:13.770 --> 46:15.300
Listen--

46:15.570 --> 46:16.930
Give me some more
of this!

46:17.240 --> 46:18.770
Give me some more
of all this stuff!

46:52.610 --> 46:53.800
It'll pass.

47:15.930 --> 47:16.790
...a couple of them
myself, too.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.460
Are you sure?

47:18.660 --> 47:21.400
(Chattering)

47:21.600 --> 47:23.730
(laughs)

47:23.970 --> 47:24.970
Jack: <i>Hey, Bessie.</i>

47:26.470 --> 47:28.240
This here Mr. Walker--
want to meet you.

47:29.780 --> 47:31.580
The hell you bring
him here for?

47:31.810 --> 47:33.040
<i>You remember him.</i>

47:33.350 --> 47:34.210
Brought him by a couple
of your shows.

47:34.580 --> 47:36.310
He wants to talk
to you about a record deal.

47:36.650 --> 47:38.280
- A real recording contract.
- Miss Smith,

47:38.650 --> 47:40.550
<i>I'd like to record</i>
<i>you for Columbia Records</i>

47:40.850 --> 47:42.290
<i>for our new</i>
<i>Race Records division.</i>

47:46.030 --> 47:48.430
What is a Race Record?
The one where they put a coon on the front?

47:48.660 --> 47:51.300
What? Um, no, ma'am.

47:51.660 --> 47:53.700
We at Columbia are taking
a different approach.

47:55.300 --> 47:57.430
I'm not interested
in your Race Records.

47:57.870 --> 48:01.710
And I'm not interested in wasting my
time singing no store-bought blues.

48:01.970 --> 48:03.140
<i>But we want your sound.</i>

48:03.440 --> 48:05.340
We want
the Bessie Smith sound.

48:05.640 --> 48:07.010
And it would be
your face on the ad,

48:07.450 --> 48:08.280
- nothing like those other records.
- I already sell out

48:08.550 --> 48:11.280
every show from
Philly to Chicago.

48:11.620 --> 48:13.280
Ain't nobody doing it
like I'm doing it.

48:13.620 --> 48:16.120
You'd attract
a broader audience.

48:16.460 --> 48:18.020
I've been doing
just fine without 'em.

48:18.320 --> 48:19.760
I can offer you
50 dollars a side.

48:19.990 --> 48:21.590
No royalties, of course.

48:21.790 --> 48:23.490
(Scoffs)

48:35.010 --> 48:37.170
Don't play with me now.

48:43.580 --> 48:45.220
J.G.

48:52.320 --> 48:54.990
Now, you want
what's in my jacket

48:55.190 --> 48:57.390
or in my pocket?

48:57.730 --> 49:00.930
(Scoffs) I already know what's in your pocket.

49:01.200 --> 49:02.800
Maybe you do,
maybe you don't.

49:03.040 --> 49:04.540
Now, what do you want?

49:04.740 --> 49:06.740
This or this?

49:07.010 --> 49:09.540
I want another velvet box.

49:16.720 --> 49:18.080
Marry me.

49:28.130 --> 49:29.790
You ou can't be
putting me upon no shelf.

49:30.100 --> 49:32.160
I ain't no
henpecked man, either.

49:36.100 --> 49:37.200
Take the chance on me.

49:51.820 --> 49:53.380
Come here, girl.

49:59.160 --> 50:00.660
Now, what's in
that other pocket?

50:00.860 --> 50:03.890
Oh. (Chuckles)

50:04.160 --> 50:08.500
Uh, just
a recording contract

50:08.730 --> 50:10.370
from Columbia Records.

50:10.570 --> 50:12.970
<i>125 a side.</i>

50:13.310 --> 50:15.040
That's double
what that man said.

50:15.370 --> 50:17.910
That's 'cause I'm fighting
for you now, baby.

50:19.510 --> 50:21.210
Well, maybe we should
tell Clarence.

50:21.510 --> 50:24.680
Uh-uh. This here is
me and you now.

50:34.260 --> 50:35.490
Man:
<i>All set. Let 'em know.</i>

50:35.890 --> 50:37.890
Man #2:
<i>Let's hope she knows what she's doing.</i>

50:38.200 --> 50:39.660
Man #3:
<i>They tell me she does.</i>

50:40.000 --> 50:42.300
<i>Take a listen.</i>
<i>This always takes...</i>

50:42.570 --> 50:44.670
Everything all right,
Bessie?

50:45.000 --> 50:45.900
Yeah, as soon as y'all
move this thing

50:46.170 --> 50:47.600
out the way,
I'm ready to go.

50:47.910 --> 50:49.370
Well, no, that's
the recording apparatus.

50:49.780 --> 50:51.710
- I know it's bigger than what--
- It's crowding me.

50:52.010 --> 50:53.580
(Stammering)
Well, we need it to--

50:53.910 --> 50:55.010
- I don't need it.
- Look, Bess, you got to--

50:55.280 --> 50:58.720
Hey, hey.
I'll help her.

50:58.920 --> 51:00.220
What's wrong?

51:02.420 --> 51:04.290
It's gonna be just like
the last time.

51:04.620 --> 51:07.390
- No, it's not.
- It ain't gonna go, J.G.

51:07.690 --> 51:08.890
It ain't gonna go, J.G.
I know it.

51:09.130 --> 51:10.260
I know how they do it.

51:10.700 --> 51:13.560
They act like they're your pal,
and then it all comes loose.

51:13.930 --> 51:16.100
You can't make no silk purse out of no sow's ear

51:16.470 --> 51:19.070
- just like Viola always said--
- Damn Viola.

51:19.300 --> 51:20.900
You hear me? Damn her.

51:21.110 --> 51:22.670
Damn Black Swan.

51:22.940 --> 51:24.810
Damn these crackers
in here.

51:25.040 --> 51:27.080
Let's just go home.

51:29.820 --> 51:34.480
Okay, we're going.
We're going now. Right now.

51:34.750 --> 51:37.020
But sing one song,
honey.

51:37.260 --> 51:39.520
The way you like it.

51:39.830 --> 51:43.060
Don't sing it for me,
them, nobody.

51:43.330 --> 51:45.060
You sing it
for yourself.

51:48.100 --> 51:49.430
Now what you say?

51:57.180 --> 51:59.610
Mr. Walker:
<i>Okay, here we go, Bessie.</i>

52:00.010 --> 52:01.910
<i>Mr. Gee, if you could just</i>
<i>step away from the cone--</i>

52:02.150 --> 52:03.380
He's staying right here.

52:03.580 --> 52:06.350
Um, okay.

Seems I done traced the lightning back to her source.

Man:
<i>Hey, boss. One more.</i>

55:00.460 --> 55:01.860
What's your name?

55:04.460 --> 55:06.500
Ain't too smart to give out names in my business.

55:09.170 --> 55:12.500
Just call me your bootlegger.
And what do I call you?

55:12.770 --> 55:14.970
You don't know who I am?

55:16.280 --> 55:18.810
Oh, I know
who you are.

55:20.880 --> 55:23.310
But what do you want me
to call you?

55:26.290 --> 55:27.920
Oh, yes. Yeah!

55:28.190 --> 55:29.990

Well, why is your

56:14.530 --> 56:16.900
Told you six months ago

56:17.200 --> 56:19.840
Look here,
we're saving money now.

56:20.270 --> 56:23.710
Ain't never have to go through

That's what I told you!

56:25.280 --> 56:27.780
Yeah, well, some are talkers
and some are doers.

56:29.610 --> 56:31.750

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.560
Hit it again.

Man: <i>New York is celebrated</i>

01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:28.870
<i>During the current season,</i>

01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:30.510
Miss Smith, so wonderful
you could join us.

01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:32.740
You're one of our
last guests to arrive.

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.040
Edgar! Mr.
Van Vechten, 4th floor.

01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:42.990
Soon, doubtless, the homely
Negro songs of lovesickness

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:47.720
<i>known as "the blues"</i>
<i>will be better known</i>

01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:50.530
<i>and appreciated by</i>
<i>white audiences.</i>

01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:52.830
It's a little tight,
don't you think?

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.440
Bessie:
<i>Ooh, yeah!</i>

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.110
Man:
<i>Bessie Smith is here!</i>

01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:09.510
Oh, you look fabulous!
I heard that you were wild.

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:11.580
Get the fuck off me.

01:03:11.850 --> 01:03:13.050
Now, where's the good music,

01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:14.750
the good food,
and the good liquor?

01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:16.790
(Chattering)

01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:20.160
Langston Hughes is the greatest Negro poet of our time.

01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:23.260
Oh. Who's the best
regular poet?

01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:25.230
(Laughing)

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.400
Van Vechten: Langston,
how about a little poem?

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:28.430
Langston: I'm not feeling up to it.

01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:29.730
Well, I'll sing
a note or two.

01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:31.030
Ladies and gentlemen,
quiet, please.

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.030
Go, girl.

01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:35.100
Miss Smith. Miss Smith,
I should warn you.

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:37.140
This crowd isn't...

01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:41.180
Van Vechten: <i>I have a treat.</i>
<i>I have a special treat.</i>

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.710
<i>The incomparable Bessie Smith</i>

01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:45.550

sing us a song.

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:47.650
(Faint applause)

01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:54.260
¶ Everybody's cryin' ¶

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:57.990
<i>¶ The workhouse blues,</i>
<i>all day ¶</i>

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.430

01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:04.500
¶ Oh, Lord ¶

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:08.770
¶ The work is so hard ¶

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:12.180
¶ Thirty days is so long ¶

¶ I can't plough ¶

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:22.790
¶ I can't cook ¶

01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:28.690
<i>¶ If I'd run away,</i>
<i>wouldn't that be good? ¶</i>

01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:33.660
¶ Well, I'm goin'
to the nation ¶

01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:39.100

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:45.340

Mmm.

Where the drinks at
around here?

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:09.870
Let me get
a little something.

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.270
You are a treasure.

01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:18.610
That was so beautiful
and so soulful,

01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:22.780
and, frankly,
exactly the kind of dusky pathos

01:05:23.050 --> 01:05:23.880
that I'm looking to capture

01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.880
for my new book
"Nigger Heaven"--

01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:27.150
- Say what?
- "Nigger Heaven," it--

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:31.850
You know
the only difference

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:33.260
between white folks
in the North

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:34.690
and white folks
in the South?

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:37.260
White folks in the South
don't care how close you get

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:39.800
as long as you don't
get too big.

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:43.400
And white folks in the North
don't care how big you get

01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:46.270
as long as you don't
get too close.

01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:51.610
(Chuckles)

01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:54.410
- Man: <i>Are you all right?</i>
- Van Vechten: <i>If Bessie Smith is crude and primitive,</i>

01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:57.350
<i>she reflects the true</i>
<i>folk spirit of her race.</i>

01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:16.370
Man:
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.100
<i>Morning, Gee!</i>

01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:21.500
I got something for you.

01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:29.410
Got somebody I want
you to meet.

01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:31.410
This here is Gertrude.

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:34.180
She's a singer.
Writes songs, too.

01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:41.690
You know Claudine
dropped out in Cincinnati.

01:06:41.890 --> 01:06:42.990
Got pregnant.

01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:44.730
So I hired Gertrude
here to replace her.

01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:47.130
What the fuck you showing her
to me for?

01:06:48.330 --> 01:06:49.570
I don't know.

01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:51.770
Thought maybe you might
have something to say.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.200
Sort of like "welcome."

01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:56.070
What kind of fucked-up name
is Gertrude?

01:06:56.410 --> 01:06:57.840
- You a half-breed?
- Excuse us, please.

01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:00.140
Go on and get yourself
something to eat, baby.

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:04.150
What the hell
is wrong with you?

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:05.580
I know you got your
side pieces,

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:07.280
but why you gotta
rub 'em in my face?

01:07:07.550 --> 01:07:08.320
I'm just trying
to build a--

01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:09.650
You want me to
sniff her for you, too?

01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.950
I'm just trying to build
a show here, Bessie.

01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:13.590
You got her
wearing my things.

01:07:13.890 --> 01:07:15.090
I know you think
<i>I'm big and ugly.</i>

01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:16.530
You think I'm blind
and dumb, too?

01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:19.730
It ain't-- it ain't like you
ain't been tipping out, too.

01:07:20.030 --> 01:07:22.100
I know it.
Tell me different.

01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:35.540
Look.

01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:38.880
Baby, I promise.
Cross my heart.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:41.350
I don't love
nobody else but you.

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:43.050
And you don't love
nobody else but me,

01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:45.960
<i>so the rest really don't</i>
<i>matter now, do they?</i>

01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:49.790
<i>You know I don't think</i>
<i>what you said.</i>

01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:52.900
You're my fine woman.

01:07:59.970 --> 01:08:01.100
Look.

01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:04.440
Let's start over, huh?

01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:07.410
Let's me and you both
clean house.

01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:14.480
Come on.

01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:17.890
Let's try.

01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:40.210
They said you had
your own train.

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:42.109
I didn't believe 'em.

01:08:42.310 --> 01:08:45.450
But goddamn, sis.

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:48.880
You a high post
now, huh?

01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:51.290
You ain't tell me
about all this.

01:08:53.319 --> 01:08:55.760
- You get that money I sent you?
- Oh, yeah.

01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:58.630
I get them little wires
you've been sending.

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:03.270
They're nice,
feeding four kids and all.

01:09:16.979 --> 01:09:18.609
Okay, look.

01:09:18.979 --> 01:09:23.290
I know you and I bump heads
most of the time,

01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:26.160
but I'm just here
to show my support.

01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:32.060
Mmm, real nice.

01:09:32.330 --> 01:09:34.700
This is from Europe and...

01:09:36.729 --> 01:09:38.330
what have you.

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:50.149
I got you something.

01:09:51.850 --> 01:09:54.580
Probably not fancy enough
for you now, but...

01:09:56.690 --> 01:09:58.150
I thought you'd like it.

01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:27.050
I'm proud of you.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.590
I'm so proud of you.

01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:50.210
You gonna stay around
for a while?

01:10:52.210 --> 01:10:53.710
Think Clarence could
get me tickets?

01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:58.550
He's in the box office.

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:05.490
Thank you.

01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:45.660
Bessie: Come on.
Come on and see.

01:11:47.130 --> 01:11:47.860
Come on in here.

01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:50.630
Come on.

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:52.330
- Come on, y'all.
- Get inside.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:53.600
The paint already fading.

01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:55.100
Bessie:
<i>Take a look around.</i>

01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:56.770
(Chattering)

01:11:57.010 --> 01:11:58.440
Man:
<i>Lord have mercy.</i>

01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:00.580
Bessie: <i>Look around,</i>
<i>breathe it in.</i>

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:03.050
Lucy: <i>This is</i>
<i>something, Bessie.</i>

01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:04.050
Smell different, don't it?

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:06.150
Listen here, Bessie.

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:08.120
We ain't talk about
getting no house.

01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:10.150
I ain't see your name
on my bank book.

01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:18.230
I mean,
I did it for us, papa.

01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:20.900
- I knew you'd like it.
- Man: <i>How the upstairs look?</i>

01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:24.530
But if you did it for us,
why all of them got to move in here for?

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.640
And especially
why is she here?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.300
Baby, she's gonna be all the way back in the house.

01:12:28.570 --> 01:12:29.870
You ain't hardly
gonna see her.

01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:34.180
I don't know why certain people's got they lip turned up.

01:12:34.410 --> 01:12:36.110
Must be smelling something.

01:12:36.410 --> 01:12:38.550
Damn right,
I'm smelling something.

01:12:38.850 --> 01:12:40.850
Must be a dead rat
in the wall.

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:42.280
Must be.

01:12:42.490 --> 01:12:45.120
Baby, stop.

01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:47.060
Why you ain't
ask me first?

01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:50.290
- See if I was ready?
- Well, I'm ready.

01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:53.330
I want a real family,
not no road family.

01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:55.330
I want the whole thing,
you know?

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.100
A big house
and everybody in it.

01:12:57.670 --> 01:13:01.070
Well, everybody ain't gonna be in it if you
don't start showing me some respect!

01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:09.450
I'm gonna put a big piano
right here,

01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:11.910
<i>a big dining room table</i>
<i>is gonna go here.</i>

01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:14.480
I'm gonna get me a nice rug
for that parlor.

01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:15.680
And I'm gonna get me
a baby, too,

01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:16.850
and I'm gonna put him
right in there.

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:18.090
- A what?
- Come see the-- a baby.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.260
Come on, see the kitchen.

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:41.740
Always a pleasure.

01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:47.280
Bess?

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:50.490
You're gonna have to start delivering.
I'm a married woman now.

01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:52.450
I can't keep doing
these pick-ups.

01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:54.860
No problem, ma'am.

01:13:55.090 --> 01:13:56.730
What do you want?

01:13:57.090 --> 01:14:00.460
I'll follow you home just like this.
(Chuckles)

01:14:00.930 --> 01:14:04.400
You trot yourself out there swinging and dangling.
See what happens.

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.640
Yeah, suits me fine.

01:14:06.970 --> 01:14:09.540
I don't want you for
no customer anymore, nohow.

01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:10.840
Why not?

01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:16.980
Every man in your life
is a business relationship.

01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:20.320
Your brother's your partner,
your man's your manager,

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:23.690
and your woman
is your dancer.

01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:25.850
And you're my
bootlegger.

01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:30.730
Not no more.

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:34.960
Matter of fact,
I'm giving you a full 100 % refund.

01:14:41.770 --> 01:14:44.270
- Richard.
- Look...

01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:50.980
I don't wanna be
in business with you.

01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:55.720
I want to be
in love with you.

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:06.560
I'll take the shine.

01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:10.530
Fine, take it.
I'm giving it to you.

01:15:10.730 --> 01:15:12.730
Not selling it.

01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:21.080
I oughta get home to J.G.

01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:24.380
Bess.

01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:27.320
You don't have to pay
for something

01:15:27.650 --> 01:15:29.420
that I'm already
offering for free.

01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:38.530
- <i>(Door opens)</i>
- I'm gonna spend it on you anyhow.

01:15:38.730 --> 01:15:40.360
<i>(Door shuts)</i>

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:43.230
Shit.

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:45.730
<i>(Chatter, laughter)</i>

01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:50.470
Bessie: Everybody!

01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:53.580
I want you to meet
Jack, Jr.

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.680
Junior, this is my family.

01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:58.910
Your new family.

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:02.420
That's your Uncle Clarence.
There's your Aunt Viola.

01:16:06.290 --> 01:16:09.790
And this is your
new daddy, Jack.

01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:19.770
<i>J.G., come meet your son, Jack, Jr.</i>

01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:33.550
How old are you, boy?

01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:35.920
Seven years old, sir.

01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:38.790
Where are you from?

01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:43.460
Shelby County
Children's Home, sir.

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:47.200
- An orphanage?
- Mm, mm, mm!

01:16:47.530 --> 01:16:49.100
Jack, Jr:
<i>I don't know about that, sir,</i>

01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:53.040
<i>but that's what</i>
<i>she told me to say.</i>

01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:55.770
Well, what's your
real name?

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:58.640
My name is
Jack Gee, Jr., sir.

01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:02.180
- Viola: Oh!
- (All laughing)

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:24.530
Come on over here
and give your daddy a hug.

01:17:29.410 --> 01:17:30.670
Bessie: <i>Whoo!</i>

01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:32.610
<i>Smells good in here.</i>

01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:34.610
<i>Eat as much</i>
<i>as you want, Jack Jr.</i>

01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:37.380
- Viola: <i>Mmm!</i>
- Happy Thanksgiving.

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:39.510
Jack: What you
looking at, Viola?

01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:40.680
Come on, sit down here.

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:43.650
With that fork there.

01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:46.020
- Know how to use a knife?
- Yes, sir.

01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:48.020
Jack: <i>That piece of chicken right there.</i>

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:50.990
(Chattering)

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:56.300
Clarence: <i>You want some of this dressing here?</i>

01:17:56.530 --> 01:18:00.270
(Chatter continues)

01:18:06.610 --> 01:18:08.110
Clarence:
<i>Wait till I'm finished.</i>

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:16.350
<i>(Woman vocalizing)</i>

01:18:30.370 --> 01:18:32.100
(giggling)

01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:35.900
Come here!

01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:59.430
Jack:
<i>Bessie, where you at, baby?</i>

01:18:59.630 --> 01:19:00.730
<i>Put 'em up.</i>

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:01.960
Yeah, guard yourself. Bam!

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:03.030
I'll knock you out.

01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:04.400
Guard that face.
Bam, bam!

01:19:04.770 --> 01:19:06.230
Come one, you ain't gonna
whup nobody like that.

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:08.270
Now, you gotta get in there,
baby. Come on. Pop!

01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:09.600
- Oh.
- There you go. Pop!

01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:11.070
There you go.
Get in there on him.

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:12.910
You can't get him if you're afraid to take one.

01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:14.880
Block him.
Block now. Block!

01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:16.510
What you trying
to do, huh?

01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:17.550
What you trying
to do?

01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:19.680
Get him, Mama!
Yeah, get him!

01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:22.950
You gonna beat
your old man, huh?

01:19:50.850 --> 01:19:52.980
Louis and I
are getting married.

01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:56.320
You and who?

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.190
I can't no more.

01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:08.230
I want a family.

01:20:09.730 --> 01:20:11.530
Like you.

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:18.140
Showbiz life
can't last forever.

01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:22.510
I just want
a normal life.

01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:49.870
Thank you.

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:08.520
<i>(Applause)</i>

You know,

Bessie, I wanna produce
your comeback tour.

And this is only the beginning.
You see, I'm putting together

No color lines,
no balconies.

Everyone under one roof
just swingin'.

01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:54.000
You're dreaming, John.

I just wanna be
a part of it.

We'll see.

01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:18.160
Give me a call?
Throw me a line?

Get tea.

01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:52.590

Chu Berry,

Well, well.

I didn't know
where you wanted to start,

01:43:15.050 --> 01:43:19.450
