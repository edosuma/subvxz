00:06.868 --> 00:08.698
[projector whirring]

00:08.732 --> 00:11.080
[mellow music]

00:11.114 --> 00:13.358
[Fergus]Countess Frankenburg,
I presume.

00:16.257 --> 00:18.535
Rex Lanson,

00:18.570 --> 00:20.296
at your service.

00:20.330 --> 00:24.300
The American moving
picture actor.

00:24.334 --> 00:27.820
You're even more
handsome in person.

00:27.855 --> 00:30.168
[Lola]Crikey! I'll say!

00:31.755 --> 00:33.619
Alicia Dumont.

00:33.654 --> 00:36.795
I must say, I prefer
planes to boats.

00:36.829 --> 00:38.417
Terribly slow, aren't they?

00:40.212 --> 00:42.214
[all laughing]

00:45.735 --> 00:47.426
Have either of you
thought about the fact

00:47.461 --> 00:50.326
that you're taking the weekend
off from solving murders

00:50.360 --> 00:53.156
to attend
a murder-mystery party?

00:53.191 --> 00:55.331
Fake murders are fun!

00:55.365 --> 00:58.541
Plus, the chef has
two Michelin stars.

00:58.575 --> 01:03.339
Apparently, his black pudding
souffle is to die for.

01:05.168 --> 01:07.136
[laughing]

01:07.170 --> 01:08.551
[Fergus]
Yeah.

01:10.553 --> 01:13.211
[Italian opera music on stereo]

01:18.181 --> 01:20.149
[burner hissing]

01:42.516 --> 01:43.620
[thudding]

01:43.655 --> 01:45.105
[clattering]

01:47.521 --> 01:49.902
[theme music]

02:09.405 --> 02:11.131
[seagulls squawking]

02:12.580 --> 02:14.927
[Fergus]It doesn't look
much like a castle.

02:14.962 --> 02:16.377
"The house of every
one is to him

02:16.412 --> 02:18.552
as his Castle and Fortress."

02:18.586 --> 02:20.933
Yeah, I was going
to say that, too,

02:20.968 --> 02:23.971
but, er, just looks
like a big ugly house.

02:25.731 --> 02:26.905
Oh, yoo-hoo!

02:26.939 --> 02:28.009
[laughs]

02:28.044 --> 02:29.356
That's Lizzie's mum.

02:29.390 --> 02:31.358
Oh, hello, Lola dear!

02:31.392 --> 02:33.222
- Hi, Mrs. Byrne.
- Mwah!

02:33.256 --> 02:35.189
This is my granny, Harry,

02:35.224 --> 02:37.847
and this is Fergus.
My boyfriend.

02:37.881 --> 02:40.263
Ooh!

02:40.298 --> 02:42.576
Mrs. Byrne, how kind of you
to invite us.

02:42.610 --> 02:45.337
Call me Helen. Or Hels.

02:45.372 --> 02:47.684
I don't mind.
I answer to both.

02:47.719 --> 02:50.722
And you are saving my bacon.

02:50.756 --> 02:53.552
I had another guest
of honour all lined up

02:53.587 --> 02:55.727
and he dropped out at
the eleventh hour.

02:55.761 --> 02:57.280
[laughs]

02:57.315 --> 02:59.317
The eleventh hour,
mind I almost

02:59.351 --> 03:01.042
shit a kitten, I kid you not.

03:01.077 --> 03:03.597
- A whole kitten?
- Yeah, anyway, come on in.

03:03.631 --> 03:06.289
Everyone else is here.
You're the last ones.

03:06.324 --> 03:08.049
He was an author.

03:08.084 --> 03:09.879
The one who dropped out
at the eleventh hour.

03:09.913 --> 03:12.019
Couldn't believe it.

03:12.053 --> 03:14.021
[Helen]
I hope it goes well.

03:14.055 --> 03:15.540
I'm sure it will.

03:16.782 --> 03:19.026
Who was it?
Anyone we would've heard of?

03:19.060 --> 03:20.924
Oh, er, curious choice,
actually.

03:20.959 --> 03:22.616
Chaney Dunkirk.

03:22.650 --> 03:25.066
Mm. That is an odd choice.

03:25.101 --> 03:27.897
He's a terrible writer,
hasn't been published in years.

03:27.931 --> 03:30.002
I know! That's what I thought.

03:30.037 --> 03:31.349
I mean, Dublin's home to

03:31.383 --> 03:32.350
the best crime writers
in the world,

03:32.384 --> 03:33.730
why would you pick him?

03:33.765 --> 03:36.837
But I just got a guest list
from the client.

03:36.871 --> 03:38.010
Mm-hm.

03:38.045 --> 03:39.840
How quaint.

03:39.874 --> 03:42.429
It's a work-in-progress.

03:42.463 --> 03:45.052
This is Jenny, our manager.

03:46.087 --> 03:48.366
Welcome to The Glenrae.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.714
Our chain has only
just acquired this place.

03:51.748 --> 03:54.475
Come back in a year,
and you won't recognise it.

03:54.510 --> 03:55.683
The other guests
are in the bar.

03:55.718 --> 03:56.960
If you want to leave
your bags there,

03:56.995 --> 03:58.376
I'll take them up
to your rooms.

03:58.410 --> 04:00.032
- Shall we?
- Yes.

04:09.559 --> 04:12.355
This is Siddharth.

04:14.081 --> 04:16.290
He'll keep you lubricated.

04:16.325 --> 04:18.568
And this is fellow
contestant, Aine.

04:18.603 --> 04:21.053
This is Harry
and Lola and Fergus.

04:21.088 --> 04:23.055
Our replacements.

04:23.090 --> 04:24.402
Replacements?

04:25.403 --> 04:27.094
Chaney Dunkirk pulled out.

04:27.128 --> 04:29.545
- He did?
- Mhm.

04:29.579 --> 04:31.719
Oh. Are you writers too?

04:31.754 --> 04:35.378
They're private detectives.
Real life ones.

04:35.413 --> 04:37.000
Does that not give
you an advantage

04:37.035 --> 04:39.071
in a murder mystery game?

04:39.106 --> 04:41.384
I guess we'll find
out about that.

04:41.419 --> 04:43.559
Well, the more
the merrier, I say.

04:43.593 --> 04:46.458
But I'm not Aine.
I'm Clare Carter,

04:46.493 --> 04:48.702
heiress to
the Carter Oil Company.

04:48.736 --> 04:49.910
[laughing]

04:49.944 --> 04:51.946
Let me introduce you
to the others.

04:53.189 --> 04:54.846
- This is...
- Finn Kinsella?

04:54.880 --> 04:55.916
Who?

04:55.950 --> 04:57.400
[Finn]
Er, ex-rugby player.

04:57.435 --> 04:58.643
[gasps]

04:58.677 --> 05:00.921
You're, like, my dad's
favourite player ever.

05:00.955 --> 05:02.509
Aww.

05:02.543 --> 05:04.407
Well, you or Brian O'Driscoll.

05:05.408 --> 05:07.652
Ah. Er... Roy Reilly,

05:07.686 --> 05:09.619
war correspondent,
at your service.

05:10.827 --> 05:14.900
Ah, over here,
this is Richard Bainbridge,

05:14.935 --> 05:18.041
Dublin's very own
Donald Trump.

05:18.076 --> 05:20.630
Ah, Helen, you tease,
you flatter me.

05:20.665 --> 05:23.081
A great man, a great man.

05:23.115 --> 05:26.015
Jay Cameron,
theatre impresario.

05:26.049 --> 05:27.465
[chuckling]

05:29.674 --> 05:31.365
Stick with me, ladies.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.712
I'll make stars
out of the both of you.

05:34.817 --> 05:36.370
Oh, oh...

05:36.405 --> 05:39.408
[Helen]And, er,
last but by no means least,

05:39.442 --> 05:42.756
newsreader extraordinaire,
Amanda Hinds.

05:42.790 --> 05:44.965
Tulip Hart, showgirl.

05:44.999 --> 05:46.760
[laughing]

05:46.794 --> 05:48.037
Right, well,
now that we're all here,

05:48.071 --> 05:50.211
let's get started, shall we?
Jenny?

05:50.246 --> 05:53.180
Yes. Our illustrious
Chef Auger has

05:53.214 --> 05:55.769
created some little
treats for you all.

05:55.803 --> 05:57.080
Sid, is he up yet?

05:57.115 --> 05:58.979
I haven't seen him.

06:03.915 --> 06:06.435
Chef. We're ready for you.

06:06.469 --> 06:08.506
Looking forward to your
nibbles up at the bar.

06:13.614 --> 06:15.167
[clears throat]

06:15.202 --> 06:16.583
You know what, I'll just
go and hurry him up.

06:16.617 --> 06:18.654
[laughs]

06:18.688 --> 06:22.968
Erm, well, while we're waiting,
why don't we kick off?

06:25.730 --> 06:28.008
If you'd like to follow me
to the residents' lounge,

06:28.042 --> 06:29.699
I have an envelope
for each of you,

06:29.734 --> 06:31.701
that will tell you a little bit
more about your characters.

06:33.462 --> 06:35.049
This way.

06:35.084 --> 06:36.637
After you.

06:36.672 --> 06:37.949
Ladies first.

06:39.985 --> 06:41.504
If you'd like to follow me.

06:42.885 --> 06:44.127
Okay...

06:45.715 --> 06:47.579
Are we ready?

06:47.614 --> 06:51.894
Erm... Mr. Cameron.

06:51.928 --> 06:53.620
Thank you.

06:53.654 --> 06:56.001
Mr. Reilly.

06:58.072 --> 06:59.177
Mr. Lans...

06:59.211 --> 07:01.110
[man coughing]

07:03.492 --> 07:04.700
What the...

07:04.734 --> 07:06.218
[coughing]

07:08.324 --> 07:10.119
[Helen]
What the...

07:10.153 --> 07:12.017
Just a little snifter, please?

07:12.915 --> 07:14.468
Mr. Dunkirk?

07:15.262 --> 07:17.609
What are you doing here?

07:17.644 --> 07:18.990
I was invited.

07:21.993 --> 07:24.202
But you...
But you cancelled.

07:24.236 --> 07:26.963
What? When? Never!

07:26.998 --> 07:29.656
Chaney Dunkirk never
disappoints his public.

07:29.690 --> 07:31.278
I'll sign autographs
in due course.

07:31.312 --> 07:32.969
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.

07:33.004 --> 07:34.074
You called me on Wednesday,

07:34.108 --> 07:35.834
and you said you
weren't coming.

07:35.869 --> 07:37.940
Wednesday? Did I?

07:37.974 --> 07:40.321
Hmm, yes.

07:40.356 --> 07:41.599
Went on a bit of a bender.

07:41.633 --> 07:43.152
You must never
take me seriously

07:43.186 --> 07:46.086
when I have my drink on.
I say the silliest things.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.225
This one time in Morocco I...

07:47.259 --> 07:48.778
[Jenny screaming]

07:48.813 --> 07:50.055
Ah! The game is afoot.

07:50.090 --> 07:51.609
Oh, goodie!

07:51.643 --> 07:53.231
I think that came
from the kitchen.

07:53.265 --> 07:55.716
- Oh, where is that?
- I'll show you.

07:57.787 --> 07:59.168
So exciting!

07:59.202 --> 08:00.928
[Helen]
It is, actually.

08:00.963 --> 08:01.929
[laughing]

08:01.964 --> 08:03.310
Oh, Jesus.

08:05.070 --> 08:06.762
[Helen]
Excuse me, erm...

08:06.796 --> 08:09.661
Exhilarating! Go this way...

08:09.696 --> 08:12.077
[Richard] Yeah, I think
it's through there. Yeah.

08:14.390 --> 08:15.529
Oh, nice!

08:15.564 --> 08:17.186
That's bloody impressive
makeup there.

08:17.220 --> 08:19.188
Woo! It's even got little
bits of brain in it.

08:19.222 --> 08:20.741
Are we meant to look for clues?

08:20.776 --> 08:22.225
[gasps]
Oh, my God!

08:23.779 --> 08:25.090
[shrieks]

08:27.990 --> 08:29.923
This isn't part of the game.

08:29.957 --> 08:32.546
You mean, he's...
Oh, Jesus!

08:32.581 --> 08:34.928
I, I was just down with him
before you arrived.

08:34.962 --> 08:36.654
He was fine.

08:38.690 --> 08:40.934
Can you lock the door
until the Guards get here?

08:40.968 --> 08:42.591
Yes, I have a key. Yes.

08:43.661 --> 08:44.662
[Helen sighs]

08:44.696 --> 08:45.939
There's no signal.

08:45.973 --> 08:47.768
Odd. There is usually
one down here.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.600
[ominous music]

09:00.332 --> 09:01.368
What is it?

09:01.402 --> 09:03.404
I...

09:03.439 --> 09:04.578
The phone is dead.

09:04.613 --> 09:05.406
- Dead?
- What?

09:05.441 --> 09:06.856
What do you mean, "It's dead?"

09:06.891 --> 09:08.996
The Wi-Fi is gone too.
I-I don't understand.

09:09.031 --> 09:11.378
This was all working
ten minutes ago.

09:11.412 --> 09:13.760
So, how do we get
the launch back?

09:13.794 --> 09:15.037
We can't. We don't.

09:15.071 --> 09:16.348
It's not due back
until tomorrow morning

09:16.383 --> 09:18.937
when it brings a couple
of chambermaids in.

09:18.972 --> 09:20.283
So, we're stuck here?

09:20.318 --> 09:22.665
It's only a few hours.
Could be worse.

09:22.700 --> 09:25.150
Except Helen said
she was with Chef Auger

09:25.185 --> 09:26.980
just before meeting us,

09:27.014 --> 09:28.982
and we were on the last ferry.

09:31.985 --> 09:33.642
So no one left.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.300
It means the killer's
still on the island.

09:38.923 --> 09:39.958
- Jesus!
- Oh, God.

09:39.993 --> 09:41.442
Oh, my God!

09:41.477 --> 09:42.789
I, I have a gun.

09:42.823 --> 09:43.893
In the safe. Here.

09:43.928 --> 09:45.757
[laughs]
A gun?

09:45.792 --> 09:47.034
[locker beeping]

09:48.795 --> 09:49.968
[door opens]

09:51.660 --> 09:53.213
It's gone.

09:53.247 --> 09:54.939
It, it was here earlier.

09:54.973 --> 09:56.319
Who else has the combination?

09:56.354 --> 09:59.184
It's just me
and the assistant manager...

10:00.289 --> 10:02.981
who is in Fiji
on his honeymoon.

10:04.465 --> 10:06.019
Fiji?

10:08.815 --> 10:10.368
[Finn]I've a hundred and ten
caps for Ireland,

10:10.402 --> 10:13.854
I think I can manage a,
what, mile-long swim.

10:13.889 --> 10:15.200
[Jenny] Well, there's
a dangerous undercurrent

10:15.235 --> 10:16.926
between here and the mainland.

10:16.961 --> 10:18.238
It'll drag you under.

10:18.272 --> 10:20.240
There's a warning
in the brochure about it.

10:20.274 --> 10:21.931
Surely, there must be
a boat somewhere.

10:21.966 --> 10:23.243
It's an island.

10:23.277 --> 10:25.314
Usually, there's a dinghy
down by the jetty

10:25.348 --> 10:28.041
but it was vandalised
the other day.

10:28.075 --> 10:30.422
It's away to be fixed.

10:30.457 --> 10:33.771
Somebody really doesn't want
us to leave the island.

10:33.805 --> 10:35.773
Except it isn't you, is it?

10:37.153 --> 10:39.708
You weren't meant to be here.

10:39.742 --> 10:42.745
Somebody doesn't want us
leaving the island.

10:48.717 --> 10:50.960
[Fergus]Any of them
could be the killer.

10:50.995 --> 10:53.929
I don't think Lizzie's mam is.
I've known her since infants.

10:53.963 --> 10:56.034
Okay, fair enough.
With the exception of Helen,

10:56.069 --> 10:57.346
anyone in there could be
the killer.

10:57.380 --> 10:59.141
And I'm not sure they
don't know each other.

10:59.175 --> 11:00.487
I mean, that Donald Trump one,

11:00.521 --> 11:02.006
I'm pretty sure
he recognised the dead chef.

11:02.040 --> 11:03.248
And the woman on the news

11:03.283 --> 11:04.767
definitely recognised
Chaney Dunkirk.

11:04.802 --> 11:06.873
Wait, you're saying these
people know each other

11:06.907 --> 11:08.875
but they're pretending not to?

11:08.909 --> 11:10.117
[sighs]

11:10.152 --> 11:12.154
God, this is why I love
going places with you.

11:12.188 --> 11:14.466
Stuff like this always happens.
It's mental.

11:14.501 --> 11:15.813
Well, I blame Harry.

11:15.847 --> 11:17.262
Stuff like this never
used to happen to me.

11:17.297 --> 11:18.401
Hold on.

11:20.541 --> 11:22.543
Huh...

11:22.578 --> 11:24.200
Cleaner's master key.

11:24.235 --> 11:25.961
Let's us into any room.

11:25.995 --> 11:27.169
[chuckles]

11:27.203 --> 11:28.722
Shall we take a look around?

11:30.310 --> 11:32.381
[sighs]
I need to use the rest room.

11:36.350 --> 11:38.490
I've just got to
change the barrel.

11:38.525 --> 11:40.458
Oh, okay.

11:40.492 --> 11:42.702
I'm going for a vape outside.
Okay?

11:44.531 --> 11:46.153
If you don't mind.

11:47.292 --> 11:49.191
Helen...

11:49.225 --> 11:51.296
how did this job come up?

11:51.331 --> 11:56.508
Oh, erm, I got a call from
a fella called Peter Travis,

11:56.543 --> 11:59.373
said he was magazine publisher
and he wanted to organise

11:59.408 --> 12:02.929
an event to promote
his new one,

12:02.963 --> 12:04.275
a crime fiction magazine.

12:04.309 --> 12:08.348
- Mm. So you never met him?
- No.

12:08.382 --> 12:11.903
What did he sound like
on the call?

12:11.938 --> 12:14.423
Oh, erm... English.

12:15.320 --> 12:16.770
I mean, it was hard to tell.

12:16.805 --> 12:19.221
He didn't sound old
and he didn't sound young.

12:19.255 --> 12:21.085
Just, you know, average.

12:21.119 --> 12:22.880
Oh...

12:22.914 --> 12:24.329
How come he's not here?

12:25.399 --> 12:27.229
No one from the magazine is.

12:28.333 --> 12:30.163
I'm going to find Finn.

12:31.578 --> 12:33.131
[door opens]

12:33.166 --> 12:34.788
[door closes]

12:38.343 --> 12:40.138
And then there were four.

12:42.347 --> 12:43.383
[sighs]

12:43.417 --> 12:44.591
Hmm.

12:48.181 --> 12:50.148
So, what are we looking for?

12:50.183 --> 12:51.287
A signed confession.

12:51.322 --> 12:53.531
Photos of him
murdering the guy.

12:53.565 --> 12:56.430
Ah, being a detective
doesn't sound that hard.

12:58.018 --> 12:59.019
[footsteps approaching]

12:59.054 --> 13:00.538
[keys jangling]

13:00.572 --> 13:01.988
Psst

13:09.996 --> 13:12.377
[suspenseful music]

13:15.001 --> 13:16.002
[door closes]

13:16.036 --> 13:17.382
[whispers]
Okay.

13:20.627 --> 13:22.353
[Lola]
Richard Bainbridge.

13:23.941 --> 13:25.080
"Excelsior"?

13:25.114 --> 13:26.598
Hmm.

13:26.633 --> 13:27.668
[keys jangling]

13:27.703 --> 13:29.291
Fancy some more snooping?

13:32.190 --> 13:34.572
Why so little staff?

13:34.606 --> 13:37.161
Oh, that was Mr. Travis.
He wanted the minimum.

13:37.195 --> 13:39.646
Just, just a chef and a barman.

13:41.027 --> 13:42.649
He didn't actually want me,

13:42.683 --> 13:44.340
but someone has
to be in charge.

13:44.375 --> 13:45.445
[chuckles]

13:45.479 --> 13:48.275
So, what can you tell me
about Chef Auger?

13:49.518 --> 13:51.589
Not much.

13:51.623 --> 13:54.316
He, he's been here
a couple of months.

13:54.350 --> 13:56.145
He wasn't a very sociable type.

13:56.180 --> 13:58.285
I didn't really get to
know him that well.

14:00.598 --> 14:03.325
I suppose it doesn't really
matter, me saying this now,

14:03.359 --> 14:05.327
but he was a bit of a drinker.

14:05.361 --> 14:07.225
We didn't know it
when we hired him.

14:08.917 --> 14:10.573
Do you have a CV for him?

14:10.608 --> 14:14.232
Yes, I do. It's in my office.
I'll get it.

14:14.267 --> 14:16.234
[door opens]

14:16.269 --> 14:17.960
[door closes]

14:17.995 --> 14:21.205
So, did any of you
know Chef Auger?

14:28.177 --> 14:29.523
Mr. Bainbridge?

14:31.180 --> 14:32.561
Did you recognise him?

14:33.976 --> 14:37.152
Why... Why would I know him?

14:37.186 --> 14:39.188
I could've sworn
that you recognised him

14:39.223 --> 14:41.363
when you saw him
in the kitchen.

14:41.397 --> 14:43.158
You're mistaken.

14:43.192 --> 14:45.574
So you did not know him, then?

14:46.989 --> 14:49.164
Are you interrogating us?

14:49.198 --> 14:50.682
No, no. I'm interrogating you.

14:50.717 --> 14:54.376
I'm curious because you can't
seem to answer my question.

14:55.273 --> 14:57.482
I believe I did answer.

14:57.517 --> 14:58.690
No, you didn't.

15:00.313 --> 15:02.246
Who put you in charge, hey?

15:03.523 --> 15:05.111
I did.

15:12.187 --> 15:14.534
Give me another drink.

15:14.568 --> 15:17.019
Unforgivable to let
a man drink alone.

15:17.709 --> 15:20.195
[pensive music]

15:31.551 --> 15:33.346
- Chef Auger's CV.
- Thank you.

15:34.450 --> 15:36.418
Hm...

15:36.452 --> 15:41.009
Head chef...
Head chef... Hmm.

15:41.043 --> 15:42.527
Ah, nothing stands out.

15:43.666 --> 15:45.979
He worked all over the world.

15:46.014 --> 15:48.154
Maybe I should take a look.

15:48.188 --> 15:50.259
I've killed more people
than I could count.

15:50.294 --> 15:53.780
In my writing, of course.
Solved more murders too.

15:53.814 --> 15:55.540
Murders of your own devising.

15:56.679 --> 15:58.060
Ah...

16:03.376 --> 16:04.998
Where have you two been?

16:05.033 --> 16:07.518
- Searching the rooms.
- What?!

16:07.552 --> 16:08.553
And we found something.

16:10.107 --> 16:12.281
Look, someone put
those in their rooms.

16:13.731 --> 16:15.388
Excelsior?

16:16.285 --> 16:17.700
I remember that name.

16:17.735 --> 16:19.323
[Fergus]Look, it was one
thing to take them,

16:19.357 --> 16:22.050
but we didn't know whether
we should open them.

16:23.292 --> 16:25.432
Hold on to them, Lola.

16:25.467 --> 16:27.503
We'll decide in due course.

16:30.851 --> 16:32.819
Erm...

16:32.853 --> 16:34.510
Has anyone here ever been on

16:34.545 --> 16:37.582
a cruise ship called
the Excelsior?

16:40.378 --> 16:41.793
No.

16:41.828 --> 16:44.175
Ah.

16:44.210 --> 16:48.214
I see the name means
something to some of you.

16:48.248 --> 16:50.078
According to his CV,

16:50.112 --> 16:51.872
five years ago, Chef Auger

16:51.907 --> 16:55.566
worked on a luxury cruise ship
called the Excelsior.

16:57.292 --> 16:58.672
And nobody's heard of it?

17:01.330 --> 17:03.574
[Aine]
It sailed from Marseilles.

17:03.608 --> 17:06.094
You know what
she's talking about?

17:07.543 --> 17:09.614
There's something I've never
told you about my past.

17:10.891 --> 17:13.204
I knew something was up
when I saw those two.

17:14.723 --> 17:16.518
I've never seen you
before in my life.

17:17.933 --> 17:22.869
Then Chaney, then Chef Auger.
It's not a coincidence.

17:22.903 --> 17:24.905
[Amanda]
You're mistaken.

17:24.940 --> 17:27.184
I get that a lot because
I'm in the public eye.

17:27.218 --> 17:29.531
People think they know me.

17:29.565 --> 17:31.878
I'm not surprised you
don't remember me.

17:31.912 --> 17:35.364
I looked very different, and
you were trollied every night.

17:35.399 --> 17:38.333
Well, there's your proof.

17:38.367 --> 17:40.852
I don't drink or do drugs.

17:40.887 --> 17:43.510
Not now maybe, but back then

17:43.545 --> 17:45.098
it was like you were
trying to break

17:45.133 --> 17:46.686
a record for how many
different things

17:46.720 --> 17:48.377
you could put in your body.

17:50.655 --> 17:52.347
And you...

17:52.381 --> 17:54.694
only ever looked at
my tits and my arse.

17:56.799 --> 17:59.802
It was a 14-day
round trip out of Marseilles.

17:59.837 --> 18:01.528
North Africa, Tangier,

18:01.563 --> 18:05.153
then up to Sicily
and the Greek islands.

18:05.187 --> 18:06.533
I was a dancer.

18:06.568 --> 18:09.605
Amanda and Richard
were both VIP guests,

18:09.640 --> 18:12.884
and Chaney was
a children's entertainer.

18:12.919 --> 18:14.886
I ran a literary masterclass.

18:14.921 --> 18:17.096
For five to 11-year-olds.

18:19.477 --> 18:21.410
All the dancers knew Richard.

18:22.446 --> 18:23.895
Knew not to be alone with him.

18:25.173 --> 18:26.588
Very handsy.

18:26.622 --> 18:28.590
That is a heinous lie!

18:28.624 --> 18:31.213
Something terrible
happened on the ship.

18:32.559 --> 18:35.907
What happened was
nothing to do with me.

18:35.942 --> 18:40.188
To say anything
different is slander!

18:40.222 --> 18:41.637
We're all to blame.

18:44.916 --> 18:46.366
What're you saying, babe?

18:47.471 --> 18:50.508
Something terrible
happened then...

18:52.372 --> 18:53.753
and it's happening again now.

18:55.237 --> 18:56.928
We all have to pay a price.

18:56.963 --> 18:59.241
[scoffs]
Nonsense.

18:59.276 --> 19:01.140
She's talking nonsense.

19:04.212 --> 19:06.455
I failed my friend.

19:06.490 --> 19:08.630
I should have looked after her.

19:08.664 --> 19:09.941
I should have...

19:10.908 --> 19:12.392
I need some air.

19:13.773 --> 19:15.464
[tense music]

19:17.017 --> 19:18.985
[panting]

19:19.019 --> 19:20.573
There's someone out there.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.024
You...

19:24.059 --> 19:25.371
[gunshot]

19:25.405 --> 19:27.545
[Finn]
Aine, oh, no... Aine!

19:28.650 --> 19:29.892
Madam! Madam!

19:29.927 --> 19:31.894
[Finn] What happened?
What happened?!

19:31.929 --> 19:34.242
Quickly! Hand me those towels.

19:34.276 --> 19:36.036
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

19:36.071 --> 19:38.384
Madam, madam, look at me!
Madam...

19:38.418 --> 19:40.006
[Helen]
Somebody do something!

19:40.040 --> 19:41.594
[Siddharth]
Oh!

19:41.628 --> 19:44.666
Oh, God! Madam, madam...

19:44.700 --> 19:46.633
I can't stand
the sight of blood!

19:46.668 --> 19:48.290
Some rugby player!

19:48.325 --> 19:50.189
It's a medical condition!

19:56.333 --> 19:59.198
I'm sorry. She's dead.

20:27.916 --> 20:30.401
I should lock this room
and go clean up.

20:33.370 --> 20:35.924
[suspenseful music]

20:43.103 --> 20:44.381
[door closes]

20:47.832 --> 20:49.627
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:49.662 --> 20:52.078
Just, you know
that feeling when

20:52.112 --> 20:53.562
you think you've
seen something

20:53.597 --> 20:55.461
but you don't know what
you've seen?

20:56.013 --> 20:57.359
I've got that.

20:57.394 --> 20:58.912
[Lola]
Hmm.

20:58.947 --> 21:00.466
Something to do with Aine?

21:02.847 --> 21:05.125
Had you known each other long?

21:05.160 --> 21:07.542
Almost a year.

21:07.576 --> 21:08.715
[Dunkirk]I've suffered
through the loss of

21:08.750 --> 21:10.717
many people I love in my life.

21:10.752 --> 21:12.478
It never gets easier.

21:12.512 --> 21:13.720
Are you talking about
the characters

21:13.755 --> 21:15.343
in your books again?

21:15.377 --> 21:16.620
[Dunkirk]A little piece of me
dies every time

21:16.654 --> 21:18.656
I'm forced to bump
one of them off.

21:20.624 --> 21:23.937
We need to talk about
the Excelsior.

21:25.767 --> 21:27.907
I don't know anything about it.

21:27.941 --> 21:30.944
[Harry]Oh, well,
as Amanda pointed out,

21:30.979 --> 21:32.463
whoever's out there

21:32.498 --> 21:35.121
is looking out for one
of you guys, not us.

21:36.605 --> 21:37.951
[sighs]

21:40.816 --> 21:42.680
Everything Aine said was true.

21:44.648 --> 21:46.339
Richard and I didn't
know each other

21:46.374 --> 21:47.823
but we were both
in first class,

21:47.858 --> 21:51.620
which meant there were places
on board only open to us.

21:53.691 --> 21:57.005
One of those places
was a VIP bar.

21:59.594 --> 22:01.665
It wasn't that busy.

22:01.699 --> 22:05.082
There were only a dozen of us
that night, including staff.

22:05.116 --> 22:06.601
And there were dancers.

22:08.085 --> 22:09.742
Aine was one of them.

22:12.123 --> 22:15.195
She's right,
I-I didn't remember her.

22:15.230 --> 22:18.475
They wore a tonne of make-up,
their hair pulled back.

22:19.614 --> 22:20.925
And one of
the other dancers was

22:20.960 --> 22:23.928
a Greek girl called Kassie.

22:24.860 --> 22:26.137
Kassandra.

22:27.794 --> 22:30.832
She was named after someone
in Greek mythology.

22:30.866 --> 22:32.627
Hm.

22:32.661 --> 22:34.111
A Trojan priestess...

22:35.423 --> 22:37.666
given the power
of prophecy by Apollo

22:37.701 --> 22:40.566
and then cursed never
to be believed.

22:41.981 --> 22:43.707
She was Aine's friend.

22:45.122 --> 22:47.366
And one night, she fell
overboard and drowned.

22:48.781 --> 22:50.610
Well, sounds like an accident.

22:51.542 --> 22:52.716
Exactly.

22:54.442 --> 22:57.790
Except one of
the other passengers

22:57.824 --> 23:02.173
saw her go out onto the private
VIP deck with someone else.

23:02.208 --> 23:04.590
And whatever
happened that night,

23:04.624 --> 23:07.213
Kassie never came back.

23:08.973 --> 23:10.596
Her body washed up
a few days later.

23:11.907 --> 23:14.945
She had been struck
before she went overboard.

23:14.979 --> 23:17.257
No way of knowing that.

23:17.292 --> 23:19.777
She might have hit her
head on the way down.

23:19.812 --> 23:21.607
Hit it on a rock.

23:21.641 --> 23:23.263
Or a dolphin.

23:23.298 --> 23:24.713
A dolphin?

23:26.508 --> 23:28.441
[Amanda]She was dead before
she hit the water.

23:29.546 --> 23:31.202
They can tell things like that.

23:32.583 --> 23:34.482
We were all questioned
by the Greek authorities

23:34.516 --> 23:36.587
but no one was ever arrested.

23:36.622 --> 23:39.521
So whoever went out on
deck with Kassie

23:39.556 --> 23:41.454
was someone who was
in the bar that night?

23:42.628 --> 23:44.940
Lola, the envelopes.

23:49.117 --> 23:52.741
Somebody left these
in your rooms earlier.

23:52.776 --> 23:55.261
There's one here for Aine,

23:55.295 --> 23:59.023
and one for you, Amanda,
and one for you, Richard.

23:59.058 --> 24:01.094
And, Mr. Dunkirk,
you don't have a room yet,

24:01.129 --> 24:02.958
but presumably once you do,

24:02.993 --> 24:05.236
you will have one
of these too.

24:05.271 --> 24:08.136
And how did you know
they were in the rooms?

24:10.172 --> 24:15.281
So, er, this one for Aine.

24:15.315 --> 24:19.768
Does anyone speak Japanese?
I only know one phrase.

24:19.803 --> 24:21.460
[Jenny]
Yes, I do.

24:22.771 --> 24:24.221
We have a hotel in Kyoto.

24:24.255 --> 24:25.947
I did my training there.

24:28.777 --> 24:32.747
This is about a businessman
named Kiyoshi Kajiwara.

24:32.781 --> 24:34.265
It's about six months old.

24:34.300 --> 24:37.855
He... he fell
or was pushed under

24:37.890 --> 24:39.788
a subway train
in Tokyo and died.

24:41.100 --> 24:42.688
There's a photo of him.

24:45.207 --> 24:48.176
Er, you're up next, Ms. Hinds.

24:48.210 --> 24:52.836
Oh, this one is
about, er, Gareth Mead

24:52.870 --> 24:54.769
from Bodmin in Cornwall.

24:54.803 --> 24:57.081
He was killed in a
hit-and-run two months ago.

25:02.846 --> 25:07.022
Hmm. You, er, speak German,
Mr. Bainbridge?

25:08.334 --> 25:10.163
No.

25:10.198 --> 25:11.993
I'm doing it at school.

25:13.926 --> 25:18.931
It's from three months ago.
A man died in a... feuer?

25:18.965 --> 25:21.002
Fire! House fire in Munich.

25:22.279 --> 25:23.970
There's no photo.

25:24.005 --> 25:26.835
You seemed to recognise
the first two?

25:26.870 --> 25:30.977
Yes, the Japanese man
was in first-class with us.

25:32.634 --> 25:37.018
And, and the Brit,
he was the DJ.

25:37.052 --> 25:40.124
The German, I'm guessing,
was the barman.

25:40.159 --> 25:42.126
He was the only German
there that night.

25:43.369 --> 25:46.337
So, three deaths,
three different countries

25:46.372 --> 25:47.994
over the last six months.

25:48.029 --> 25:49.409
Yeah, but now it's five deaths.

25:49.444 --> 25:52.654
Mm. And three more
potential victims.

25:55.208 --> 25:58.280
Someone is avenging
Kassie's murder...

25:59.799 --> 26:01.111
and since they have no way of

26:01.145 --> 26:03.872
finding out
who the real killer is...

26:03.907 --> 26:06.944
they're going to kill everyone
that was there that night.

26:06.979 --> 26:10.603
Eleven innocents die, so one
guilty person is punished.

26:10.638 --> 26:12.950
[sniggers] Well, that's
not fair. I didn't kill her.

26:12.985 --> 26:14.607
I didn't either.

26:14.642 --> 26:15.850
No, it's not fair.

26:15.884 --> 26:17.783

to understand that

26:30.485 --> 26:32.729
description of you
from way back when.

26:34.213 --> 26:38.044
Yes, well, I've changed
a lot since then.

26:38.079 --> 26:42.704
I... I come from money, you see,
so I could do whatever I wanted

26:42.739 --> 26:45.707
and Daddy would
always bail me out.

26:45.742 --> 26:46.777
[Amanda scoffs]

26:46.812 --> 26:49.400
I was a silly little rich girl.

26:49.435 --> 26:53.301
Then he lost everything and
I had to grow up and get a job.

26:53.335 --> 26:56.373
And your first job was
as a newsreader on RTA?

26:56.407 --> 26:59.203
Yes, well, my father
still had contacts. So...

26:59.238 --> 27:03.691
Wait a minute, is your
father not Jack Hinds?

27:03.725 --> 27:06.003
He's still one of
the richest men in Ireland.

27:06.038 --> 27:07.004
Okay, he might've
had to downgrade

27:07.039 --> 27:08.419
from three jets to two,

27:08.454 --> 27:10.180
but I'd hardly say that
he lost everything.

27:10.214 --> 27:11.871
Yes, well,
it's hard to understand

27:11.906 --> 27:13.804
if you're not from that world.

27:13.839 --> 27:15.150
Oh, really?

27:15.185 --> 27:16.807
It was a wake-up call.

27:18.740 --> 27:20.293
No one can get in.

27:20.328 --> 27:22.295
Right, we'll all be safe
here till the boat arrives

27:22.330 --> 27:24.297
as long as we don't
leave this room.

27:24.332 --> 27:25.989
[fire alarm ringing]

27:26.023 --> 27:27.059
What?

27:27.093 --> 27:28.267
If the killer is
willing to kill

27:28.301 --> 27:30.131
eleven innocents
to punish one guilty

27:30.165 --> 27:31.684
then they probably
won't baulk at burning

27:31.719 --> 27:33.479
the whole place down
to kill all of us.

27:47.286 --> 27:48.943

27:56.536 --> 27:58.918
Well done, Lola.
That was impressive.

27:58.953 --> 28:01.403
We had a training session at
school with the Fire Brigade.

28:03.129 --> 28:06.063
This... this was just
a distraction.

28:33.228 --> 28:34.782
So, what's the plan?

28:34.816 --> 28:36.197
I mean, it's clear
the killer's not going to

28:36.231 --> 28:38.958
let us just hide
in here till morning.

28:38.993 --> 28:40.995
There has to be
a boat somewhere.

28:41.029 --> 28:42.824
Hidden, I mean.

28:42.859 --> 28:46.138
The killer'll need to leave
before the Guards come. Right?

28:46.172 --> 28:48.796
Smart thinking.
What about it, Jenny?

28:48.830 --> 28:52.800
Where could the killer
hide their getaway dinghy?

28:52.834 --> 28:54.974
Well, I mean,
there's tonnes of inlets.

28:55.009 --> 28:57.218
There's even a bunch of
caves up on the north side.

28:57.252 --> 28:58.598
They're not very big now,

28:58.633 --> 29:00.980
but they might be big
enough for a small boat.

29:01.015 --> 29:04.121
But finding them now
would be impossible.

29:04.156 --> 29:07.055
We would have to wait
till the first light.

29:07.090 --> 29:09.057
Where exactly are
you from in India?

29:10.403 --> 29:11.922
I mean, you don't
look very Indian.

29:11.957 --> 29:13.165

29:13.199 --> 29:15.892
There are over a billion
people in India, madam,

29:15.926 --> 29:17.410
we don't all look the same.

29:17.445 --> 29:19.965
I'm from the Punjab
in the north.

29:19.999 --> 29:21.414
We're lighter
skinned up there.

29:21.449 --> 29:22.622
Mm.

29:22.657 --> 29:24.279

I find myself in need

29:27.524 --> 29:30.527
Lola, I need you
to do something for me.

29:30.561 --> 29:34.462
I need you to repeat something
exactly how I say it.

29:35.635 --> 29:37.189
Who am I repeating it to?

29:39.053 --> 29:41.331
[Harry]It's a vital tool
for all travellers

29:41.365 --> 29:43.471
and I want to see
what his reaction is.

29:43.505 --> 29:45.093
Okay. What do I say?

29:45.991 --> 29:48.027

you're old enough.

It's a vital tool
for any traveller.

30:20.059 --> 30:22.234
Okay, what did I just say?

30:23.994 --> 30:26.686
You just asked for a
large glass of red wine.

30:26.721 --> 30:28.205
In Greek.

30:28.240 --> 30:29.862
How d'you know how to say that?

30:29.897 --> 30:31.001
Oh, I know that sentence in

other languages.

30:32.692 --> 30:33.866

So what did it prove?

30:35.626 --> 30:37.352
Ah, nothing yet,

30:37.387 --> 30:39.044
but I don't think he's Indian.

30:39.078 --> 30:42.288
Well, he was right,
that's a bit racist.

30:42.323 --> 30:45.153
Well, it's not racist
if I'm right.

30:45.188 --> 30:46.292
We need to wait a bit

30:46.327 --> 30:48.225

to forget about

A distraction
that would speed things up.

30:56.061 --> 30:59.340
Sorry, hold on. He, he
couldn't have shot Aine.

30:59.374 --> 31:02.584
I mean, he was in plain
sight of all of us.

31:02.619 --> 31:04.138
And he was standing
right next to us

31:04.172 --> 31:05.346

31:05.380 --> 31:07.106
so he couldn't have
harpooned Richard.

No, no, that's a point, but...

31:09.074 --> 31:10.454

31:10.489 --> 31:12.111
He could be working
with the killer.

31:12.146 --> 31:14.217
Yeah, but to what end?

31:15.494 --> 31:17.945
He's not doing anything
to help the killer.

31:17.979 --> 31:19.153
Or is he?

31:20.430 --> 31:22.328
I need to slip out
and check on a theory.

31:22.363 --> 31:24.468

to the kitchen.

bound to collect experience.

34:59.407 --> 35:01.306
My old granny used
to swear by it.

35:01.340 --> 35:02.928
Nothing like a "good punch in
the balls," she always said.

35:02.962 --> 35:04.378
She was right.

35:04.412 --> 35:06.897
Oh, you need a drink.
I'll get you a drink.

35:06.932 --> 35:08.727
It's a free bar. Allow me.

35:12.420 --> 35:14.215
Drinks for everyone, Sid.

35:17.011 --> 35:20.532
Ki minnu wine da
ek glass mil sakda hai?

35:21.498 --> 35:22.948
[laughs]

35:22.982 --> 35:27.366
Ki minnu wine da
ek glass mil sakda hai?

35:27.401 --> 35:30.300
I, I don't know
what you're saying.

35:30.335 --> 35:33.752
Oh, that's funny. I just asked
for a large glass of red wine...

35:34.891 --> 35:37.169
in Punjabi.

35:37.204 --> 35:38.550
Which, of course,
you ought to understand

35:38.584 --> 35:41.311
because you come
from Northern India.

35:41.346 --> 35:45.488
Oh, trust me,
my pronunciation's perfect.

35:45.522 --> 35:49.492
I find it kind of odd
that you understand Greek,

35:49.526 --> 35:50.734
but not Punjabi.

35:52.219 --> 35:55.532
You're no more
Indian than I am.

35:55.567 --> 36:00.434
I guess that you were connected
in some way with Kassandra.

36:01.883 --> 36:05.301
Husband? Boyfriend? Brother?

36:07.751 --> 36:10.478
Aah, her brother!

36:12.031 --> 36:14.206
She was more than
just my sister.

36:14.241 --> 36:15.518
She was my twin.

36:16.760 --> 36:19.936
Do you know what it feels
like to lose a twin?

36:20.799 --> 36:21.765
It's like losing a limb.

36:21.800 --> 36:23.353
It was you! You shot my Aine!

36:23.388 --> 36:24.527
[Dunkirk]
He couldn't have shot her.

36:24.561 --> 36:26.736
He was in here
with the rest of us.

36:29.359 --> 36:30.912
[Fergus]How can you
afford all of this?

36:30.947 --> 36:34.019
Hiring out the hotel,
hiring Helen?

36:34.053 --> 36:36.401
Flying around
the world to kill people.

36:36.435 --> 36:37.643
Ethniko.

36:39.749 --> 36:41.923
The Greek national lottery.

36:41.958 --> 36:45.893
Seven months ago, I won
the top prize, a million euro.

36:45.927 --> 36:48.999
And you thought, "I know just
how to spend this money."

36:49.897 --> 36:52.037
It was a sign, you see.

36:52.071 --> 36:54.384
I had used
Kassie's lucky number.

36:54.419 --> 36:57.456
Then who? Who shot my Aine?

36:58.526 --> 37:00.010
No one.

37:00.045 --> 37:01.529
What?

37:01.564 --> 37:02.910
[gunshot]

37:03.980 --> 37:05.706
[Fergus]
Sound effect.

37:05.740 --> 37:07.017
[sighs]

37:09.503 --> 37:13.058
This speaker used to be outside
the fire escape in the bar.

37:13.092 --> 37:14.542
[gunshot]

37:14.577 --> 37:15.992
Don't you move!

37:17.580 --> 37:19.789
But she was bleeding
like anything.

37:19.823 --> 37:22.067
Sound effect and a blood bag.

37:22.101 --> 37:24.380
She brought a bag
of blood with her?

37:24.414 --> 37:25.933
I'll have to remember
that for my next book.

37:26.761 --> 37:28.522
She didn't need to.

37:28.556 --> 37:30.593
Bags were in
the fridge already

37:30.627 --> 37:35.080
for Chef Auger's world-famous
black pudding souffle.

37:35.114 --> 37:37.876
There were three bags earlier.
Now only two.

37:37.910 --> 37:41.776
I... still don't understand.
Who harpooned Richard?

37:41.811 --> 37:43.295
What happened to the...

37:45.987 --> 37:47.644
I'm sorry, Finn.

37:47.679 --> 37:49.059
I really am.

37:49.819 --> 37:51.924
It was a necessary evil.

37:51.959 --> 37:53.409
[Finn]
Why?

37:54.858 --> 37:56.446
I thought you were dead.

37:57.758 --> 37:59.553
How could you...

37:59.587 --> 38:01.589
Woah, hey!

38:01.624 --> 38:03.729
[Aina]
That's the gun from the safe.

38:03.764 --> 38:05.628
I'll make this simple.

38:05.662 --> 38:07.733
We brought you here
to kill you.

38:07.768 --> 38:09.942
Four birds with one stone.

38:11.392 --> 38:13.394
Two birds are dead.

38:13.429 --> 38:15.327
Now, you can both die

38:15.362 --> 38:18.675
or if one of you wants
to confess, now's the time.

38:20.643 --> 38:22.886
Just so you know...

38:22.921 --> 38:24.578
what happened to Kassie
was just as

38:24.612 --> 38:27.339
life-changing to
the person responsible.

38:27.374 --> 38:29.652
You know who it is?

38:29.686 --> 38:31.343
Then tell me!

38:31.378 --> 38:34.035
I swear I'll shoot all of you
if you don't tell me.

38:35.589 --> 38:36.935
She's serious.

38:38.833 --> 38:42.112
Do you really want to let
everyone in this room die

38:42.147 --> 38:44.356
rather than own up
to what you did?

38:45.668 --> 38:47.394
Who are you talking to?

38:48.740 --> 38:51.121
[suspenseful music]

38:56.610 --> 38:58.612
It was an accident.

38:58.646 --> 39:00.096
I'm so sorry.

39:02.201 --> 39:03.962
Your father didn't
lose everything.

39:05.066 --> 39:08.553
Something else,
just as momentous,

39:08.587 --> 39:11.383
made you change your life,
made you sober up...

39:12.695 --> 39:14.386
get a real job.

39:14.421 --> 39:15.698
I was a spoilt little brat

39:15.732 --> 39:18.010
who was used to getting
everything she wanted.

39:21.220 --> 39:24.362
And that night,
I wanted the German barman.

39:26.122 --> 39:28.089
I'd been flirting
with him all evening

39:28.124 --> 39:32.784
and... he only had
eyes for Kassie.

39:32.818 --> 39:37.616
We, we went out on the deck
and I told her to back off.

39:37.651 --> 39:39.169
That he was mine.

39:39.204 --> 39:41.137
The thing is, I don't think
she was even into him

39:41.171 --> 39:45.072
but I was... off my face.

39:47.005 --> 39:49.421
She laughed and said,
"Have him,"

39:49.456 --> 39:51.527
but I thought she was laughing
at me and...

39:52.769 --> 39:54.737
I got so angry.

39:54.771 --> 39:56.773
Then I hit her.

39:56.808 --> 40:01.502
Just once, but I used to wear
these big, chunky rings.

40:01.537 --> 40:03.953
And I, I hit her
harder than I meant to...

40:05.299 --> 40:07.508
She fell backwards
and the momentum took her

40:07.543 --> 40:09.165
over the railings and then...

40:10.615 --> 40:12.064
she was just gone.

40:12.996 --> 40:14.550
The water was pitch black.

40:15.792 --> 40:17.553
I-I couldn't see anything.

40:19.313 --> 40:21.798
I took off my rings
and threw them overboard.

40:24.283 --> 40:25.595
Kill me.

40:27.839 --> 40:28.874
I deserve it.

40:28.909 --> 40:30.497
[breathes heavily]

40:31.843 --> 40:34.259
- Do it.
- Okay.

40:34.293 --> 40:35.985
- Woah! Woah! Woah, woah!
- Jesus!

40:36.019 --> 40:37.676
Aine, don't!

40:37.711 --> 40:40.092
[grunting]

40:41.611 --> 40:42.819
Oh, my...

40:42.854 --> 40:44.269
[grunting]

40:46.098 --> 40:47.065
[gunshot]

40:47.099 --> 40:48.618
- Ugh!
- Oh, God!

40:51.000 --> 40:52.484
[Harry]Chaney!

40:53.554 --> 40:54.382
The pain!

40:54.417 --> 40:55.625
[Jenny]Has he been shot?

40:55.660 --> 40:56.937
I think so.

40:56.971 --> 40:58.041
Where?!

40:58.076 --> 40:59.629
I see a light!

41:00.906 --> 41:05.739
Mother? Oh, so cold...

41:05.773 --> 41:06.947
[sighs]

41:06.981 --> 41:09.121
Into the greatest
adventure I go.

41:10.916 --> 41:12.746
Chaney?

41:12.780 --> 41:13.988
Chaney!

41:15.956 --> 41:17.647
Chaney, you've been
shot in the foot.

41:21.202 --> 41:24.620
Oh... I liked those shoes.

41:24.654 --> 41:25.793
[groans]

41:25.828 --> 41:29.625
Oh. No more
murder-mystery weekends.

41:30.971 --> 41:33.076
It's good to be back
to normality.

41:33.905 --> 41:35.320
Ah, um...

41:36.355 --> 41:38.012
[Glenn]Usual, Harry?

41:38.910 --> 41:40.014
Thanks, Glenn.

41:40.049 --> 41:41.291
Right you are.

41:42.845 --> 41:44.122
[sighs]

41:49.299 --> 41:51.750
There's a lot to be
said for normality.

41:53.303 --> 41:55.340
You said a mouthful
there, girl.

41:58.032 --> 41:59.689
Mm...

41:59.724 --> 42:02.105
[theme music]
