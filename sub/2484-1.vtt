<i>In the beginning was the Word...</i>

01:01.561 --> 01:05.630
<i>and the Word was with God...</i>

01:05.632 --> 01:08.933
and the Word was God.

01:08.935 --> 01:11.502
He was with God...

01:11.504 --> 01:13.671
in the beginning.

01:19.144 --> 01:22.613
<i>He was there, in Paradise...</i>

01:22.615 --> 01:24.615
with Adam and Eve.

01:31.457 --> 01:34.425
He was there with Noah...

01:34.427 --> 01:35.727
in the great flood.

01:41.066 --> 01:44.369
<i>He was there with Abraham
when he was chosen.</i>

01:44.371 --> 01:49.674
<i>Abraham, I will make you a
father of many nations.</i>

01:53.879 --> 01:55.546
<i>He was there when Moses</i>

01:55.548 --> 01:57.815
<i>led our people out of Egypt.</i>

01:57.817 --> 02:01.352
<i>I will be with you.</i>

02:01.354 --> 02:02.720
Moses!
Moses!

02:04.958 --> 02:06.591
Lord!

02:08.827 --> 02:11.629
God is with us!

02:11.631 --> 02:13.364
<i>In the struggle for
the Promised Land...</i>

02:15.635 --> 02:18.870
<i>He was always by our side.</i>

02:25.812 --> 02:27.311
Jerusalem.

02:27.313 --> 02:30.014
Our new home.

02:32.584 --> 02:37.588
<i>He was the light shining
in the darkness.</i>

02:38.757 --> 02:42.527
<i>Then He came into the world.</i>

02:50.869 --> 02:54.739
A star shall come out of Jacob

02:54.741 --> 02:58.376
and a scepter shall
rise out of Israel.

03:00.313 --> 03:04.082
<i>The Word became flesh...</i>

03:05.784 --> 03:10.321
Look.
<i>...and made His dwelling among us.</i>

03:17.363 --> 03:19.263
Our son.

03:38.350 --> 03:41.652
Lady, I believe your son

03:41.654 --> 03:44.088
is the promised King of His people.

03:45.124 --> 03:47.258
What is His name?

03:49.995 --> 03:52.230
Jesus.

03:54.266 --> 03:56.834
His name is Jesus.

04:16.488 --> 04:19.824
I am John...

04:19.826 --> 04:22.226
<i>and I was one of His followers.</i>

04:23.662 --> 04:26.697
After what I saw...

04:26.699 --> 04:28.866
how could I not be?

04:40.712 --> 04:42.780
Jewish land.

04:44.551 --> 04:47.685
Jewish people.

04:48.554 --> 04:51.656
Our Jewish nation...

04:52.524 --> 04:54.859
under Roman rule.

04:57.696 --> 04:59.664
In the name of Rome,

04:59.666 --> 05:02.466
taxes are owed.

05:02.468 --> 05:04.669
So just pay up.

05:04.671 --> 05:07.071
- Get in line.
- That'll do.

05:07.073 --> 05:10.007
- Times are tough!
- Put it there... all of it.

05:10.009 --> 05:11.776
- Get out of the way.
- Get back.

05:11.778 --> 05:15.313
<i>Occupied... and oppressed.</i>

05:17.383 --> 05:18.583
Those who spoke out...

05:21.588 --> 05:23.254
were crushed.

05:26.291 --> 05:28.960
We craved a savior.

05:30.028 --> 05:32.029
A messiah.

05:55.187 --> 05:58.789
<i>But instead we got a
new Roman governor.</i>

06:00.727 --> 06:03.461
Pontius Pilate.

06:06.064 --> 06:07.865
Halt!

06:07.867 --> 06:09.934
What's going on?

06:09.936 --> 06:13.537
- I can't lift it. It's too heavy.
- You're in the way!

06:13.539 --> 06:14.672
Let me help.

06:14.674 --> 06:16.140
You need to be quick.
I know.

06:22.848 --> 06:24.415
Prefect.

06:24.417 --> 06:26.684
What's the delay this time?

06:26.686 --> 06:28.853
It's a broken cart, sir.

06:28.855 --> 06:30.254
Well, what are you waiting for?

06:30.256 --> 06:32.290
Get it off the road.

06:32.292 --> 06:33.557
Let's get it moved.

06:33.559 --> 06:36.093
Will it be much longer?

06:38.197 --> 06:40.131
Very soon, my love.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.567
Come on, move.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.369
Move!

06:48.241 --> 06:51.642
- The governor needs to pass.
- I'm doing all I can.

06:51.644 --> 06:54.712
Pilate won't wait.

06:54.714 --> 06:56.814
- Wait, I can fix it.
- Move it!

06:56.816 --> 06:59.350
No, my son.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.619
Move!
No, my son.

07:03.189 --> 07:04.455
Father.

07:15.467 --> 07:18.035
Son. My son!

07:24.210 --> 07:26.177
Come on.

08:36.481 --> 08:37.948
Nothing here.

08:49.961 --> 08:51.962
Do you need help?

08:51.964 --> 08:54.165
I'm not looking for any
help, and besides,

08:54.167 --> 08:58.235
there's nothing to help with.

09:14.886 --> 09:18.622
Hey, you can't just
climb into my boat.

09:18.624 --> 09:20.357
Yeah, you're right.

09:20.359 --> 09:23.160
Give me a helping hand.

09:41.112 --> 09:43.814
What do you think you're doing?

09:43.816 --> 09:45.182
We're going fishing.

09:45.184 --> 09:47.218
There are no fish out
there this time of day.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.853
In fact, there are no fish out here

09:48.855 --> 09:51.021
any time of day.
Peter...

09:52.591 --> 09:55.926
just give me an hour,

09:55.928 --> 09:58.462
and I will give you
a whole new life.

10:01.066 --> 10:03.234
Who says I want one?

10:08.406 --> 10:10.374
I'm telling you...

10:13.144 --> 10:15.479
there's no fish out there.

11:13.872 --> 11:15.472
There's fish.

11:43.101 --> 11:45.736
How did this happen?

11:47.939 --> 11:49.740
What did you do?

11:49.742 --> 11:53.744
I'm giving you the chance
to change your life.

11:57.649 --> 12:00.584
Peter...

12:00.586 --> 12:03.320
come with me.

12:03.322 --> 12:06.857
Give up catching fish,
and I will make you

12:06.859 --> 12:09.126
a fisher of men.

12:09.128 --> 12:11.362
What are we going to do?

12:15.200 --> 12:17.635
Change the world.

12:26.378 --> 12:28.646
<i>When Jesus spoke to me...</i>

12:28.648 --> 12:31.382
I followed.

12:33.785 --> 12:35.786
Others joined us.

12:37.856 --> 12:41.625
Soon our numbers grew.

12:43.228 --> 12:45.229
And all who heard Him

12:45.231 --> 12:48.799
felt His power.

12:59.911 --> 13:01.211
No, it's my turn.

13:02.748 --> 13:07.284
Put the Lord your God to the test.

13:07.286 --> 13:11.889
You shall untiringly
keep the Commandments

13:11.891 --> 13:13.757
of the Lord your God

13:13.759 --> 13:16.860
and His statutes which He

13:16.862 --> 13:18.862
has commanded you.

13:18.864 --> 13:21.031
You shall do what is right

13:21.033 --> 13:24.902
and what is good in
sight of the Law.

13:24.904 --> 13:26.937
Look, can you see?

13:26.939 --> 13:28.138
Over there.

13:32.978 --> 13:35.813
So the Lord commanded us

13:35.815 --> 13:38.882
to observe all these statutes.

13:38.884 --> 13:41.719
It's Jesus!

13:58.636 --> 13:59.703
This way, John.

13:59.705 --> 14:01.171
Keep everyone moving.

14:06.911 --> 14:08.979
Welcome, Jesus.

14:35.106 --> 14:37.975
How shall we picture
the Kingdom of God?

14:40.779 --> 14:43.113
It is like a mustard seed

14:43.115 --> 14:47.284
which a man took and
sowed in his field.

14:50.156 --> 14:54.291
The smallest seed in the world...

14:54.293 --> 14:57.361
yet, when planted...

15:07.373 --> 15:09.573
it grows up.

15:10.708 --> 15:12.476
Rabbi.

15:17.749 --> 15:20.017
He's paralyzed.

15:43.541 --> 15:47.344
Your sins are forgiven, my son.

15:49.881 --> 15:51.715
Did you hear that?

15:54.118 --> 15:56.453
He has forgiven his sins.

15:58.156 --> 16:00.090
I thought only God could do that.

16:00.092 --> 16:02.693
Isn't that blasphemy?

16:02.695 --> 16:04.328
He knows.

16:04.330 --> 16:05.863
It is blasphemy.

16:07.098 --> 16:09.499
Is that your wish, my friend?

16:12.704 --> 16:15.172
Well, answer me.

16:15.174 --> 16:17.608
Tell me which is easier.

16:19.577 --> 16:22.145
To say his sins are forgiven...

16:24.082 --> 16:26.683
or say...

16:29.220 --> 16:32.623
get up and walk.

16:59.751 --> 17:00.784
Wait.

17:02.287 --> 17:04.354
The Son of Man

17:04.356 --> 17:07.457
has authority to forgive sin.

17:15.133 --> 17:17.099
Friends.

17:18.169 --> 17:20.270
What is this about?

17:20.271 --> 17:22.239
Not even Moses himself
would have thought

17:22.241 --> 17:23.507
he could forgive sin.

17:23.509 --> 17:25.275
You heard what our teacher said.

17:25.277 --> 17:26.443
On what authority

17:26.444 --> 17:28.244
does he think he can do this?

17:28.247 --> 17:29.947
On His authority.

17:30.982 --> 17:33.016
That is blasphemy.

17:33.018 --> 17:36.119
Only God can forgive sin,

17:36.121 --> 17:37.988
and your friend...

17:37.990 --> 17:42.592
could be stoned for a
false claim like this.

17:42.594 --> 17:44.962
This is just the beginning.

17:46.164 --> 17:48.131
Let's go.

18:22.333 --> 18:24.901
Greetings, Prefect.

18:24.903 --> 18:26.703
Welcome to Judaea.

18:26.705 --> 18:29.172
I hope your time here
will be prosperous

18:29.174 --> 18:30.307
and peaceful.

18:30.309 --> 18:33.210
I intend to make sure it is.

18:33.212 --> 18:34.478
From Caesar.

18:34.480 --> 18:37.214
Disorder will not be tolerated.

18:44.122 --> 18:45.956
Next.

18:47.892 --> 18:49.192
Is that all?

18:49.194 --> 18:50.327
Next.

18:50.329 --> 18:53.997
All taxes must be paid in full!

18:56.034 --> 18:58.935
It's all I have. Get out of here.
Take it away.

18:58.937 --> 19:01.038
No.

19:03.107 --> 19:04.908
We're all Jews.

19:04.910 --> 19:07.210
Our own people working for Rome.

19:07.212 --> 19:09.346
Makes me sick.

19:09.348 --> 19:10.614
Collaborators.

19:10.616 --> 19:12.249
Let's move on.

19:17.622 --> 19:19.790
They're stinking vermin.

19:21.359 --> 19:23.627
You should keep your
distance from them.

19:26.230 --> 19:28.198
Two men...

19:30.301 --> 19:32.069
went to the Temple to pray.

19:34.105 --> 19:36.273
One a Pharisee

19:36.275 --> 19:38.909
and the other one...

19:40.611 --> 19:42.779
a tax collector.

19:45.016 --> 19:47.217
The Pharisee prayed,

19:47.219 --> 19:52.122
"God, I thank you that
I'm not like other men."

19:53.524 --> 19:58.261
"Thieves... adulterers...

19:58.263 --> 20:02.065
or this tax collector."

20:06.671 --> 20:09.306
But the tax collector

20:09.308 --> 20:12.876
didn't even look up to Heaven.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.045
He said,

20:15.047 --> 20:17.914
"God...

20:17.916 --> 20:21.518
"have mercy on me.
Have mercy on me.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.787
I'm a sinner."
I'm a sinner.

20:29.827 --> 20:34.030
God blessed the tax collector,

20:34.032 --> 20:36.933
not the Pharisee.

20:38.536 --> 20:41.404
Anyone who praises himself

20:41.406 --> 20:44.107
will be humbled...

20:45.977 --> 20:48.178
and anyone who humbles himself

20:48.180 --> 20:51.448
will be praised.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.416
Matthew...

20:54.886 --> 20:56.853
come.

21:12.637 --> 21:14.638
See...

21:14.640 --> 21:17.440
now he even calls the
sinners to follow him.

21:17.442 --> 21:21.211
One has to wonder of
the sins committed

21:21.213 --> 21:23.180
by his other followers.

21:25.216 --> 21:27.217
Alms.

21:33.524 --> 21:35.692
Tax collectors.

21:37.662 --> 21:39.729
There's not a thread of
good in any of them.

21:39.731 --> 21:43.266
Thomas, Jesus has not
come for the good

21:43.268 --> 21:44.768
but for the sinners.

21:44.770 --> 21:47.337
He gives people a second chance.

21:47.339 --> 21:50.707
We should, too.

21:52.543 --> 21:54.544
<i>Blessed are the poor,</i>

21:54.546 --> 21:57.280
<i>for theirs is the
Kingdom of Heaven.</i>

21:57.282 --> 21:59.616
Blessed are the meek,

21:59.618 --> 22:02.919
<i>for they shall inherit the earth.</i>

22:02.921 --> 22:04.921
Blessed are the pure in heart,

22:04.923 --> 22:07.991
for they shall see God.

22:07.993 --> 22:12.162
Pray to Him and He will listen.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.197
And how should we pray?

22:20.171 --> 22:22.138
Like this.

22:25.576 --> 22:27.577
Our Father who is in Heaven,

22:27.579 --> 22:30.380
hallowed be Your name...

22:31.415 --> 22:34.417
Your Kingdom come,

22:34.419 --> 22:36.653
Your will be done

22:36.655 --> 22:39.689
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

22:39.691 --> 22:42.392
<i>Give us this day our daily bread</i>

22:42.394 --> 22:44.294
and forgive us our trespasses,

22:44.296 --> 22:48.331
<i>as we forgive those who
trespass against us.</i>

22:50.836 --> 22:53.536
Stone her!

22:53.538 --> 22:55.338
She's a whore!

22:55.340 --> 22:58.475
No! Mother!

23:01.512 --> 23:02.779
Mother!

23:02.781 --> 23:04.948
- Please!
- Adulteress!

23:06.798 --> 23:08.318
- Here.
- Come away.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.719
Mary, over here.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.855
The Law commands us

23:11.857 --> 23:14.491
to stone such a woman.

23:18.629 --> 23:20.563
What do you say?

24:17.688 --> 24:19.856
I'll give my stone...

24:22.026 --> 24:24.361
to the first man who tells me...

24:26.397 --> 24:29.299
that he has never sinned.

25:07.405 --> 25:09.406
Go...

25:09.408 --> 25:12.208
and sin no more.

25:13.077 --> 25:16.079
Thank you. Thank you.

25:29.827 --> 25:31.828
<i>This cannot continue.</i>

25:31.830 --> 25:35.732
He ridicules our laws...

25:35.734 --> 25:38.701
insults the traditions
of our fathers.

25:40.137 --> 25:43.807
Everything we have
fought so hard for.

25:43.809 --> 25:48.278
Our faith, our communities.

25:50.014 --> 25:52.949
Everything God has given.

25:55.786 --> 25:58.455
You have heard it said,

25:58.457 --> 26:00.857
"Do not commit adultery."

26:00.859 --> 26:02.325
Why don't you join us?

26:02.327 --> 26:04.360
But I tell you that any man

26:04.362 --> 26:05.829
who even looks at a
woman with lust...

26:05.831 --> 26:07.197
You're welcome, brother.

26:09.033 --> 26:11.134
Has already committed adultery.

26:11.136 --> 26:13.770
Why do you follow him?

26:13.772 --> 26:16.806
He is leading us to
something greater.

26:16.808 --> 26:18.775
Open your eyes.

26:18.777 --> 26:22.045
This is a dangerous man.

26:34.459 --> 26:39.362
High Priest, Nicodemus
is here to see you.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.801
Caiaphas.

26:44.803 --> 26:47.237
Nicodemus.

26:48.639 --> 26:50.840
I've had reports of
a young prophet,

26:50.842 --> 26:53.142
a Jesus of Nazareth.

26:53.144 --> 26:55.345
He has a big following in Galilee.

26:55.347 --> 26:57.547
It's rumored he'll
come to Jerusalem.

26:57.549 --> 26:59.682
Galilee?

26:59.684 --> 27:00.950
He works miracles.

27:00.952 --> 27:02.819
They all do.

27:05.022 --> 27:07.190
Nicodemus, don't worry.

27:07.192 --> 27:09.926
Nothing important ever
came from Galilee.

27:12.663 --> 27:15.498
A miracle worker from Galilee.

27:35.586 --> 27:38.054
Jesus! Jesus!

27:38.923 --> 27:41.558
Looks like a quiet place.

27:50.701 --> 27:53.102
Pull. That's it.

27:53.871 --> 27:55.672
Take a rope.

27:55.674 --> 27:56.873
Lock it off.

27:56.875 --> 27:58.841
Rabbi, let me help you.

28:12.723 --> 28:16.426
Look, it's him.

28:18.729 --> 28:21.598
Look, it's Jesus!

28:22.733 --> 28:24.734
There he is.

28:39.183 --> 28:41.517
They've come a long way.

28:41.519 --> 28:43.586
They're hungry.

28:43.588 --> 28:44.787
Give them food.

28:44.789 --> 28:46.155
But how?

28:46.157 --> 28:47.390
We have nothing.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.792
Just a few fish and some bread.

28:50.861 --> 28:53.196
Bring them to me.

29:11.682 --> 29:13.683
Thank you, Father,

29:13.685 --> 29:17.153
for what You bring us.

29:27.264 --> 29:31.067
Our Father in Heaven feeds

29:31.069 --> 29:33.102
the birds of the air.

29:33.104 --> 29:37.940
How much more will He give to you?

30:01.031 --> 30:04.667
Don't worry about daily needs.

30:04.669 --> 30:07.570
God will provide.

30:07.572 --> 30:11.140
Put God first and everything
else will follow.

30:13.144 --> 30:16.412
If you hunger for righteousness,

30:16.414 --> 30:21.184
you will be filled through me.

30:21.186 --> 30:23.186
He said ask...

30:26.156 --> 30:28.157
and it will be given.

30:29.461 --> 30:31.828
John, we can feed them all.

30:37.167 --> 30:38.701
From God.

30:41.939 --> 30:43.473
It's from God.

30:43.475 --> 30:45.942
Messiah! Messiah!

30:45.944 --> 30:51.080
Messiah! Messiah! Messiah!

30:59.189 --> 31:00.757
They want you to be

31:00.759 --> 31:01.924
their King.

31:01.926 --> 31:03.559
King of the Jews.

31:03.561 --> 31:05.328
You can lead us like an army.

31:05.330 --> 31:06.863
We're strong enough
to beat the Romans!

31:06.865 --> 31:08.464
No.

31:08.466 --> 31:10.366
No, this is not the way.

31:10.368 --> 31:12.735
Not by force.

31:18.442 --> 31:19.642
Peter!

31:19.644 --> 31:21.944
Where is he going?
What's wrong?

31:29.353 --> 31:31.721
5,000 came to see him.

31:31.723 --> 31:34.791
5,000.

31:34.793 --> 31:37.660
Now they shout "Messiah."

31:51.542 --> 31:54.143
The people today,

31:54.145 --> 31:57.513
they called you "King."

31:57.515 --> 31:59.682
They think you are a messiah.

31:59.684 --> 32:02.919
But you seemed to ignore them.

32:09.159 --> 32:11.494
Aren't you going to be our king?

32:13.797 --> 32:15.832
Who do you think I am?

32:20.938 --> 32:23.639
You are the Son of God.

32:29.980 --> 32:32.048
You can't have known this

32:32.050 --> 32:34.717
by what you know of me, Peter.

32:34.719 --> 32:37.787
It has been revealed to you by God.

32:40.457 --> 32:42.391
You are Peter,

32:42.393 --> 32:44.660
and on this rock...

32:45.495 --> 32:47.897
I will build my church.

32:53.103 --> 32:54.303
Tomorrow...

32:54.305 --> 32:56.105
I will meet you on the other shore.

33:07.751 --> 33:11.687
Why did he walk away just
when we're getting strong?

33:13.457 --> 33:16.192
Surely a messiah wouldn't
leave us like this.

33:16.194 --> 33:18.194
A messiah should be a...

33:18.196 --> 33:20.696
a warrior, a conqueror like David.

33:20.698 --> 33:22.231
Judas,

33:22.233 --> 33:25.201
force is not the way.

33:25.203 --> 33:27.103
So tell me what the way

33:27.105 --> 33:28.271
of the Messiah is.

33:28.273 --> 33:29.739
He's different.

33:29.741 --> 33:31.774
But, Mary, what if
he's not the one?

33:31.776 --> 33:33.876
We're risking our lives, for what?

33:33.878 --> 33:35.344
Thomas!

33:35.346 --> 33:36.579
He has shown us his power.

33:36.581 --> 33:38.514
We must have faith in him.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.449
He said he'd meet us
on the other side.

33:40.451 --> 33:42.818
Let's go!

34:08.411 --> 34:11.112
Bring the sail down!

34:11.114 --> 34:12.882
Tie everything down!

34:28.732 --> 34:30.065
This is too dangerous!

34:30.068 --> 34:32.568
We should turn back
while we still can.

34:32.570 --> 34:35.571
You heard what he said.

34:35.572 --> 34:37.706
He wants us to cross.

34:38.442 --> 34:41.310
What is that?

34:41.312 --> 34:43.612
What's that?

34:49.987 --> 34:51.721
It's a ghost!

34:54.058 --> 34:55.891
No, Thomas,

34:55.893 --> 34:57.927
it's Jesus!

35:00.464 --> 35:02.832
He is the Messiah.

35:03.867 --> 35:06.769
Peter.

35:14.611 --> 35:17.646
Peter, what are you doing?

35:24.254 --> 35:26.222
Don't be afraid.

35:27.424 --> 35:29.558
Come.

35:58.522 --> 36:00.122
Peter!

36:04.127 --> 36:05.127
Peter!

36:06.163 --> 36:08.330
<i>Peter.</i>

36:08.332 --> 36:11.400
You of little faith.

36:11.402 --> 36:14.170
Why did you doubt?

36:15.305 --> 36:17.640
Who do you think I am?

36:17.642 --> 36:20.443
<i>The Son of God.</i>

36:29.052 --> 36:32.888
Make way for the High Priest.

36:34.691 --> 36:37.626
Make way for the High Priest!

36:38.830 --> 36:40.796
Mama, they're coming!

36:40.798 --> 36:41.864
Mommy!

36:44.167 --> 36:46.936
Malchus? Malchus?

36:46.938 --> 36:49.071
Malchus! What's happening?

36:49.073 --> 36:51.407
It's another protest, High Priest.

36:55.579 --> 36:57.279
We need to get you out of here.

36:57.281 --> 36:58.514
It's turning into a riot.

36:58.516 --> 37:00.449
Get the master back
to his residence

37:00.451 --> 37:02.017
quick as you can!

37:03.787 --> 37:06.021
What is all this about?

37:06.023 --> 37:07.023
The aqueduct.

37:07.024 --> 37:08.491
People are furious that the Romans

37:08.493 --> 37:10.025
used the Temple funds to build it.

37:10.027 --> 37:11.894
Hundreds are heading
to complain to Pilate.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.496
What?

37:13.498 --> 37:17.299
He'll have them cut down before
they can get anywhere near him.

37:24.374 --> 37:25.441
Thieves!

37:35.986 --> 37:38.354
Jerusalem needs water.

37:38.356 --> 37:40.422
You think your God brings it?

37:40.424 --> 37:42.224
No, He does not.

37:42.226 --> 37:44.627
Rome does.

37:44.629 --> 37:46.662
It's time you understood

37:46.664 --> 37:49.899
what your masters do for you!

38:50.327 --> 38:53.128
There's nothing Pilate
won't do to keep control.

39:16.854 --> 39:19.188
Martha,

39:19.190 --> 39:21.457
what's wrong?

39:25.328 --> 39:27.296
My brother is dead.

39:28.565 --> 39:31.233
Show me the tomb.

39:51.888 --> 39:54.223
He's been there four days.

40:10.573 --> 40:12.941
Lazarus.

40:16.780 --> 40:19.315
I am...

40:19.317 --> 40:21.283
the resurrection...

40:23.920 --> 40:26.088
and the life.

40:28.358 --> 40:31.360
Anyone who believes in me...

40:34.431 --> 40:36.398
even if he dies...

40:39.903 --> 40:42.338
he will still have life.

41:09.766 --> 41:11.934
Lazarus!

41:30.253 --> 41:31.653
My brother!

41:35.725 --> 41:38.494
Whoever believes in me...

41:39.529 --> 41:41.530
shall never die.

41:41.532 --> 41:43.665
Believe in me,

41:43.667 --> 41:46.869
and you will see

41:46.871 --> 41:49.471
the glory of God.

41:53.510 --> 41:55.944
<i>I knew that word of such a miracle</i>

41:55.946 --> 41:57.546
would spread fast.

41:57.548 --> 42:00.349
No one could ignore it.

42:00.351 --> 42:03.519
<i>Least of all, the authorities.</i>

42:07.457 --> 42:08.457
Caiaphas.

42:11.728 --> 42:15.564
They say this Jesus has
raised a man from the dead.

42:15.566 --> 42:16.965
What?

42:16.967 --> 42:19.468
He-he could come here

42:19.470 --> 42:20.869
to Jerusalem for Passover.

42:20.871 --> 42:22.037
No.

42:22.039 --> 42:23.639
But if he comes

42:23.641 --> 42:25.307
with thousands of supporters,

42:25.309 --> 42:26.308
the city will already be breaking

42:26.310 --> 42:27.843
at the seams with those arriving

42:27.845 --> 42:30.479
for the festival.
Nicodemus, you are right.

42:30.481 --> 42:33.582
The Romans will step in.

42:33.584 --> 42:34.917
We...

42:34.919 --> 42:37.419
must not allow this miracle man,

42:37.421 --> 42:39.822
this <i> fraud,</i>

42:39.824 --> 42:41.990
to disrupt Passover.

42:43.059 --> 42:45.194
Does Pilate know?

42:47.263 --> 42:49.097
Hmm.

42:55.873 --> 42:57.072
Where's my wife?

42:57.074 --> 42:58.774
It's late.

43:02.980 --> 43:05.247
Claudia, what?

43:05.249 --> 43:06.715
I...

43:06.717 --> 43:09.218
I saw a man...

43:10.954 --> 43:12.821
in a dream.

43:12.823 --> 43:15.824
A man being beaten

43:15.826 --> 43:17.559
and killed.

43:17.561 --> 43:20.362
An innocent man.

43:21.698 --> 43:24.433
A holy man.

43:26.503 --> 43:28.470
A good man.

43:31.107 --> 43:32.541
Help your lady back to bed.

43:32.543 --> 43:34.643
No!

43:34.645 --> 43:37.045
It was a warning.

43:39.983 --> 43:43.151
It was you who killed him.

44:08.811 --> 44:11.213
Mary, he's here!

44:11.215 --> 44:12.215
Who?

44:12.216 --> 44:15.684
Jesus!
He's back at last!

44:15.686 --> 44:17.619
<i>Lady,</i>

44:17.621 --> 44:19.321
I believe your son

44:19.323 --> 44:21.523
is the promised King of His people.

44:21.525 --> 44:23.759
What is His name?

44:23.761 --> 44:26.728
<i>His name is Jesus.</i>

45:01.364 --> 45:04.633
Amen.

45:04.635 --> 45:07.069
Amen.

45:07.071 --> 45:10.505
Jesus will now read from Isaiah.

45:12.375 --> 45:14.543
The spirit of the Lord...

45:16.446 --> 45:18.080
is upon me

45:18.082 --> 45:21.049
because He...

45:21.051 --> 45:23.352
has anointed me

45:23.354 --> 45:26.455
to preach good news to the poor.

45:27.991 --> 45:31.760
He has sent me...

45:31.762 --> 45:33.028
to declare freedom

45:33.030 --> 45:35.364
for the captives

45:35.366 --> 45:38.433
and recovery of sight
for the blind.

45:39.469 --> 45:42.371
To set free...

45:42.373 --> 45:44.906
those who are oppressed.

45:50.446 --> 45:52.748
Today...

45:58.721 --> 46:01.657
this Scripture...

46:01.659 --> 46:03.992
is fulfilled.

46:07.131 --> 46:08.730
What are you saying?!

46:15.004 --> 46:16.972
What are you saying?

46:16.974 --> 46:18.774
That you have achieved all this?

46:18.776 --> 46:20.242
That you are the Messiah?

46:20.244 --> 46:23.578
The Chosen One sent by God? No!

46:23.580 --> 46:26.915
I'm saying you must
accept God's Word.

46:26.917 --> 46:28.116
How dare you.

46:28.118 --> 46:29.317
That is sacrilege.

46:29.319 --> 46:32.354
He has never studied the Law.

46:32.356 --> 46:34.056
This man knows nothing!

46:34.058 --> 46:36.558
His healing is the work of demons.

46:37.593 --> 46:39.728
It has begun.

46:43.666 --> 46:46.401
He undermines our faith!

46:48.204 --> 46:49.805
He recruits adulterers!

46:49.807 --> 46:52.174
Peter!

46:52.176 --> 46:54.543
Turn the other cheek.

46:54.545 --> 46:56.445
You'll pay the price for this!

46:56.447 --> 46:59.481
Like your friend, John the Baptist!

46:59.483 --> 47:02.017
You haven't heard, have you?

47:02.019 --> 47:05.420
He was executed! Beheaded!

47:21.204 --> 47:22.437
He was a good man.

47:25.942 --> 47:28.009
<i>Baptize me.</i>

47:37.254 --> 47:39.888
John was the greatest
teacher I ever knew.

47:42.558 --> 47:44.326
He was more than a prophet.

47:50.733 --> 47:52.667
Our work goes on.

47:54.403 --> 47:56.571
Soon we go to Jerusalem.

48:03.980 --> 48:05.981
Jerusalem?

48:05.983 --> 48:07.749
It's too soon.

48:07.751 --> 48:09.718
It's too dangerous.

48:09.720 --> 48:11.119
We're not ready.

48:11.121 --> 48:13.188
Judas,

48:13.190 --> 48:15.891
why are we all here?

48:15.893 --> 48:18.527
To take the easy path?

48:18.529 --> 48:20.996
We must take the
message to Jerusalem.

48:20.998 --> 48:23.031
Right to the heart

48:23.033 --> 48:25.934
of power.

48:34.710 --> 48:36.912
<i>We set out for Jerusalem.</i>

48:36.914 --> 48:39.247
<i>Thousands were heading there</i>

48:39.249 --> 48:41.316
<i>for the festival of Passover.</i>

48:51.327 --> 48:53.695
The Messiah! Bring your palm!

48:53.697 --> 48:55.330
Messiah! Messiah!

48:55.332 --> 48:57.065
Bring your palm leaves!

49:08.811 --> 49:11.646
This way! This way!

49:19.856 --> 49:21.823
Look at this!

49:24.427 --> 49:25.994
Messiah! Messiah!

49:25.996 --> 49:28.029
Messiah.

49:39.375 --> 49:40.542
Where is he now?

49:40.544 --> 49:42.210
He's just entered the city

49:42.212 --> 49:43.845
on a donkey.

49:44.680 --> 49:47.682
"See, your King comes to you

49:47.684 --> 49:50.385
"righteous and victorious,

49:50.387 --> 49:51.920
"humble

49:51.922 --> 49:54.155
and riding on a donkey."

49:54.157 --> 49:56.091
Where's he headed?

49:56.093 --> 49:58.593
Towards the Temple.

49:58.595 --> 50:03.298
He must not interfere
with Passover.

50:03.300 --> 50:04.666
God...

50:04.668 --> 50:07.636
will bring His wrath
down upon all of us,

50:07.638 --> 50:09.304
and...

50:09.306 --> 50:11.439
who knows what Pilate will do

50:11.441 --> 50:14.175
if the crowds run out of control?

50:14.177 --> 50:16.311
Nicodemus, go with Malchus.

50:16.313 --> 50:18.446
If he enters the Temple,

50:18.448 --> 50:19.915
watch him.

50:19.917 --> 50:21.316
Do not blink.

50:21.318 --> 50:23.018
Go.

50:52.181 --> 50:53.882
The Kingdom is coming!

50:53.884 --> 50:55.116
Jesus!

50:55.118 --> 50:57.752
The Kingdom is coming!

50:57.754 --> 50:59.087
Messiah!

50:59.089 --> 51:00.622
It's Barabbas.

51:00.624 --> 51:02.490
- Messiah!
- Messiah!

51:02.492 --> 51:04.659
King of Israel!

51:04.661 --> 51:07.128
Why don't you make us free?

51:07.130 --> 51:09.698
Save us from the Romans, Lord!

51:22.144 --> 51:24.112
We come in peace, Barabbas.

51:37.727 --> 51:40.996
- Get out of the way!
- Get back!

51:46.403 --> 51:48.603
It's Jesus.

52:05.956 --> 52:09.524
He's going into the Temple!

52:36.686 --> 52:38.553
- Do you exchange money here?
- Yes!

52:40.957 --> 52:44.459
Change your money here!

52:44.461 --> 52:46.261
Two and a five.
I give you one.

52:49.866 --> 52:51.599
Very best rates...

52:51.601 --> 52:54.402
- Don't like the look of this.
- Exchange here!

53:05.981 --> 53:07.215
Jesus...

53:12.421 --> 53:14.522
What are you doing?

53:14.524 --> 53:17.125
Jesus,

53:17.127 --> 53:18.359
please...

53:18.361 --> 53:20.061
please.

53:20.063 --> 53:21.896
Is it not written?

53:21.898 --> 53:23.865
Wait.

53:25.201 --> 53:27.335
Is it not written?

53:27.337 --> 53:29.971
My house!

53:30.840 --> 53:33.308
My house shall be called

53:33.310 --> 53:36.678
a house of prayer?

53:36.680 --> 53:39.514
But you... you have made it

53:39.516 --> 53:41.516
a den of thieves!

53:41.518 --> 53:44.319
Who are you to tell us this?

53:52.761 --> 53:54.863
We teach the Law,

53:54.865 --> 53:56.431
not you.

53:57.500 --> 54:00.034
You pray lofty prayers...

54:00.036 --> 54:02.036
and love

54:02.038 --> 54:04.739
your shows of piety in the Temple.

54:09.278 --> 54:11.713
Hypocrites.

54:34.503 --> 54:36.671
This is outrageous.

54:36.673 --> 54:38.806
And you were little help.
He's clever.

54:38.808 --> 54:41.876
The crowd worship him.

54:41.878 --> 54:43.878
There is something...

54:43.880 --> 54:45.880
unusual about him.

54:45.882 --> 54:47.582
There is nothing unusual about him

54:47.584 --> 54:50.385
apart from his ability
to cause havoc.

54:50.387 --> 54:53.188
If he returns,

54:53.190 --> 54:54.322
challenge him.

54:54.324 --> 54:56.191
Make his supporters
see their "Messiah"

54:56.193 --> 54:58.459
for the simple-minded
peasant that he is.

55:04.633 --> 55:06.301
Sir.

55:06.303 --> 55:08.036
We're eating.

55:08.038 --> 55:13.007
Sir, a Jew has been causing
trouble in the Temple.

55:13.009 --> 55:14.542
So?

55:14.544 --> 55:17.178
He has a large number
of supporters.

55:19.715 --> 55:21.683
What's his name?

55:21.685 --> 55:23.384
They call him Jesus of Nazareth.

55:24.453 --> 55:27.422
My servants talk about him.

55:27.424 --> 55:29.224
He's Caiaphas's business.

55:29.226 --> 55:31.659
But you keep an eye on the crowds.

55:31.661 --> 55:33.094
If they start to get out of hand,

55:33.096 --> 55:35.496
I'll shut the Temple... festival

55:35.498 --> 55:37.565
or no festival.

55:43.372 --> 55:45.907
Thank you very much.

55:45.909 --> 55:47.809
You're very kind.

55:47.811 --> 55:49.744
Where's Judas?

55:49.746 --> 55:51.679
Have you seen him?

55:51.681 --> 55:53.381
No.

56:08.497 --> 56:09.998
<i>I'm worried.</i>

56:10.000 --> 56:12.667
<i>Things are getting out of control.</i>

56:12.669 --> 56:15.270
Come to me when you need...

56:15.272 --> 56:17.305
assistance.

56:35.557 --> 56:37.258
Alms for the poor.

56:37.260 --> 56:38.426
God bless you.

56:45.067 --> 56:47.268
Be quiet, be quiet.

56:47.270 --> 56:49.270
It is much harder...

56:49.272 --> 56:50.738
for a rich person

56:50.740 --> 56:53.441
to enter the Kingdom of God

56:53.443 --> 56:55.243
than it is...

56:55.245 --> 56:58.446
for a camel to go through
the eye of a needle.

56:58.448 --> 57:00.982
The most important thing

57:00.984 --> 57:03.718
is that you should
love your neighbor

57:03.720 --> 57:05.787
as you love yourself.

57:05.789 --> 57:07.155
Teacher!

57:09.893 --> 57:11.893
They say you are learned.

57:11.895 --> 57:13.995
So tell us,

57:13.997 --> 57:17.298
should we pay taxes to the Romans?

57:17.300 --> 57:19.033
No! No!

57:27.676 --> 57:30.345
Well, teacher...

57:30.347 --> 57:31.846
should we...

57:31.848 --> 57:33.981
pay the Romans taxes?

57:33.983 --> 57:35.983
- Or...
- Not pay!

57:35.985 --> 57:39.253
Not pay! Not pay!

57:43.760 --> 57:46.260
Israel! Israel!

57:46.262 --> 57:50.164
Israel! Israel!

57:50.166 --> 57:51.766
Tell him.

57:51.768 --> 57:54.402
Whose face is on the coin?

57:55.471 --> 57:57.138
Caesar's.

58:02.644 --> 58:05.179
Then give to Caesar...

58:06.482 --> 58:09.817
what is Caesar's.

58:09.819 --> 58:12.520
And give to God...

58:12.522 --> 58:14.021
what is God's.

58:41.483 --> 58:42.683
High Priest...

58:42.685 --> 58:44.619
that man, there,

58:44.621 --> 58:46.921
with Jesus...

58:46.923 --> 58:48.556
he wants to help us.

58:48.558 --> 58:50.024
Really?

58:50.026 --> 58:52.393
That could be useful.

59:07.810 --> 59:11.546
You let him get the better of you.

59:13.215 --> 59:17.351
Yet I may have found a
way to deal with him.

59:31.533 --> 59:33.701
Do you see all these...

59:33.703 --> 59:36.003
great buildings?

59:36.005 --> 59:39.440
Not one stone of this place...

59:39.442 --> 59:42.210
not one stone...

59:42.212 --> 59:44.645
will be left standing.

59:57.727 --> 01:00:00.561
<i>He said what?</i>

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:04.332
Not one stone will
be left standing.

01:00:07.369 --> 01:00:10.505
He threatens to destroy the Temple.

01:00:13.008 --> 01:00:16.611
We must move swiftly but softly.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:21.949
We cannot arrest him openly,
or his supports will run riot.

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:24.485
No, not at Passover, no!

01:00:24.487 --> 01:00:25.853
No.

01:00:29.324 --> 01:00:31.659
We must bring him in...

01:00:31.661 --> 01:00:34.395
quietly, at night,

01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:36.030
before Passover.

01:00:36.032 --> 01:00:39.033
Malchus, what was
the name of that...

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:41.936
follower of his that
you pointed out to me?

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:43.471
Judas, High Priest.

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:45.439
Judas. Yes.

01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:49.744
Bring him to me.

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:51.312
Here.

01:01:32.588 --> 01:01:34.488
Prefect,

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:36.090
you're needed.

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:38.859
There's trouble.

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:41.028
Roman scum! Roman thieves!

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:42.730
Let's show them!

01:01:42.732 --> 01:01:43.931
Roman thieves!

01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:47.568
Scum!

01:01:49.237 --> 01:01:51.505
Roman thieves! Roman scum!

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:55.343
<i>Since I've been prefect...</i>

01:01:55.345 --> 01:01:57.712
you Jews

01:01:57.714 --> 01:02:00.715
have tested my patience
to breaking point.

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:01.882
Now I'm beyond it.

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:03.150
Yes, but, Prefect...

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:06.153
I'm speaking!

01:02:06.155 --> 01:02:08.756
If the disturbances
that took place today

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:12.426
are repeated tomorrow, I will
shut the Temple immediately.

01:02:12.428 --> 01:02:14.562
There will be no Passover.

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:16.464
I will put this city under curfew.

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:19.433
I will crush any rebellion.

01:02:20.435 --> 01:02:23.771
Do I make myself absolutely clear?

01:02:43.425 --> 01:02:45.760
What are you preparing, Mary?

01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:09.250
Rabbi.

01:03:15.957 --> 01:03:17.558
Welcome.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.493
I come here of my own accord.

01:03:19.495 --> 01:03:23.264
The High Priest knows
nothing of this.

01:03:26.935 --> 01:03:29.837
What's he doing here?

01:03:44.486 --> 01:03:45.820
Judas.

01:03:54.396 --> 01:03:56.964
Your friend from Galilee

01:03:56.966 --> 01:03:59.300
has caused quite a stir.

01:04:09.144 --> 01:04:11.645
One cannot deny

01:04:11.647 --> 01:04:13.581
that he has followers,
especially amongst

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:17.318
the less well-educated element.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.487
But you, Judas...

01:04:20.388 --> 01:04:23.591
I'm intrigued.

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:25.626
He...

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:27.228
he has a power.

01:04:28.498 --> 01:04:31.132
It's hard for me to put into words.

01:04:31.134 --> 01:04:32.900
A power

01:04:32.902 --> 01:04:34.769
to cause trouble,

01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:37.037
to stir things up.

01:04:41.042 --> 01:04:43.410
Attacking money changers...

01:04:44.312 --> 01:04:46.347
threatening

01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:49.483
to destroy the Temple...

01:04:49.485 --> 01:04:51.752
the holy of holies.

01:04:53.855 --> 01:04:55.856
If he were

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:59.660
the Son of God...

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:01.195
if...

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:04.565
would he abuse the House of God?

01:05:07.903 --> 01:05:10.070
The true Messiah

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:12.106
will unite Israel,

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:14.208
not divide it.

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:17.344
What do you want with him?

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:19.446
Just to talk.

01:05:20.348 --> 01:05:23.317
If the Romans step in,

01:05:23.319 --> 01:05:27.087
can you imagine the slaughter?

01:05:27.089 --> 01:05:30.958
It will mean the end
of the Temple...

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:34.161
the end of our faith...

01:05:34.163 --> 01:05:36.697
the end of our nation.

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:40.701
Is that what you want, Judas?

01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:43.470
Judas...

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:46.373
you are his friend.

01:05:46.375 --> 01:05:49.677
Bring him here, discreetly.

01:05:51.179 --> 01:05:54.448
Let us try to stop this

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:56.917
while we still can.

01:06:01.656 --> 01:06:04.124
And what's in it for me?

01:06:15.837 --> 01:06:17.972
Good.

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:21.742
We shall expect to hear
from you presently.

01:06:24.279 --> 01:06:26.714
They say you can perform miracles.

01:06:27.849 --> 01:06:31.151
That you have seen
the Kingdom of God.

01:06:33.355 --> 01:06:35.856
You can see the Kingdom of God.

01:06:39.227 --> 01:06:41.795
But you must be born again.

01:06:42.797 --> 01:06:45.766
Born again? How can you be...

01:06:45.768 --> 01:06:47.201
born again?

01:06:49.204 --> 01:06:51.906
You must be reborn...

01:06:51.908 --> 01:06:54.308
not in the flesh...

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:56.677
but in a spirit.

01:07:13.728 --> 01:07:16.931
The wind blows where it wishes.

01:07:16.933 --> 01:07:20.200
You don't know where
it comes from...

01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:23.504
or where it goes.

01:07:24.973 --> 01:07:29.209
And so it is when the
spirit enters you.

01:07:30.845 --> 01:07:32.379
God...

01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:35.983
so loved the world...

01:07:35.985 --> 01:07:39.787
that He gave His one and only Son.

01:07:41.856 --> 01:07:44.625
Believe in Him...

01:07:44.627 --> 01:07:47.161
and you will have eternal life.

01:08:01.376 --> 01:08:05.245
Malchus, any word from Judas?

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:08.415
Nothing, High Priest.

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:12.453
I won't wait any longer.

01:08:12.455 --> 01:08:14.655
We arrest this false
prophet tonight.

01:08:14.657 --> 01:08:17.457
How do we know

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:19.859
he is a false prophet?

01:08:20.962 --> 01:08:23.063
Has he fulfilled...

01:08:23.064 --> 01:08:27.368
<i>any</i> of the signs of a
true messiah as written

01:08:27.370 --> 01:08:30.837
in our Scriptures?

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:37.243
He will be tried
according to our Law.

01:08:38.313 --> 01:08:40.413
We remove this man,

01:08:40.416 --> 01:08:43.017
or the Romans destroy everything.

01:08:43.019 --> 01:08:44.283
Remove?

01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:46.687
Yes, Nicodemus.

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:49.423
The life of one peasant

01:08:49.425 --> 01:08:52.091
for the future of God's nation.

01:09:01.903 --> 01:09:06.807
- What does he want us for?
- To take supper.

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:09.243
Just supper?

01:09:22.323 --> 01:09:23.823
Whose is it?

01:10:04.399 --> 01:10:06.500
We thank You, Lord,

01:10:06.502 --> 01:10:11.004
by whose Word
everything comes to be.

01:10:11.006 --> 01:10:14.374
Amen.

01:10:24.419 --> 01:10:26.120
John.

01:10:34.295 --> 01:10:37.131
This is our last meal together.

01:10:40.301 --> 01:10:42.469
Before I die.

01:10:50.311 --> 01:10:52.880
What do you mean?

01:10:54.549 --> 01:10:58.018
I'm going to be betrayed
to my enemies...

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.288
arrested...

01:11:03.291 --> 01:11:06.126
and condemned to death.

01:11:15.737 --> 01:11:18.772
Don't be afraid.

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:21.542
Trust in God.

01:11:23.144 --> 01:11:25.145
Trust in me, also.

01:11:26.247 --> 01:11:29.683
You know the way to
where I'm going.

01:11:29.685 --> 01:11:31.418
We don't know where you're going.

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.220
How can we know the way?

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:35.923
I am the way...

01:11:38.126 --> 01:11:40.294
the truth...

01:11:41.362 --> 01:11:44.264
and the life.

01:11:54.442 --> 01:11:56.310
Take it.

01:12:00.515 --> 01:12:02.716
Eat.

01:12:15.129 --> 01:12:17.764
This...

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:19.766
this is my body.

01:12:37.218 --> 01:12:39.286
This is my blood.

01:12:46.494 --> 01:12:49.830
Remember me...

01:12:49.832 --> 01:12:53.133
by doing this.

01:12:53.135 --> 01:12:55.135
I'm going to the Father...

01:12:57.105 --> 01:13:00.374
but I will always be with you.

01:13:03.978 --> 01:13:07.848
Now I must tell you

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:11.018
that one of you here...

01:13:11.853 --> 01:13:15.022
will betray me.

01:13:17.458 --> 01:13:18.558
Who?

01:13:30.505 --> 01:13:32.572
Whoever eats this.

01:13:33.875 --> 01:13:36.743
I will not.

01:13:36.745 --> 01:13:39.379
I will not betray you.

01:13:50.958 --> 01:13:53.093
Do it quickly.

01:14:01.002 --> 01:14:03.437
Let him go.

01:14:42.543 --> 01:14:45.145
You will all fall away.

01:15:05.833 --> 01:15:07.534
Rabbi.

01:15:09.737 --> 01:15:13.006
I will not fall away.

01:15:16.711 --> 01:15:19.679
I will lay down my life for you.

01:15:19.681 --> 01:15:22.249
Will you?

01:15:22.251 --> 01:15:24.785
I will.

01:15:43.738 --> 01:15:45.172
Peter...

01:15:46.007 --> 01:15:48.809
I tell you...

01:15:48.811 --> 01:15:51.645
before dawn...

01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:55.315
you will deny me three times.

01:16:28.382 --> 01:16:30.517
Judas.

01:16:30.519 --> 01:16:32.919
Where is he?

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:36.756
I-I...
Do you know where he is now?

01:16:37.792 --> 01:16:40.126
I know where he's going.

01:16:41.028 --> 01:16:43.230
Lead my servant to him.

01:17:17.798 --> 01:17:21.868
Wake up, and keep awake.

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:23.270
The time has come.

01:17:24.472 --> 01:17:27.807
The spirit is willing,
but the flesh...

01:17:27.809 --> 01:17:29.376
is weak.

01:17:32.446 --> 01:17:34.414
I must pray.

01:17:40.855 --> 01:17:42.856
<i>Father...</i>

01:17:46.894 --> 01:17:50.597
I know...

01:17:50.599 --> 01:17:54.000
it must be...

01:17:54.002 --> 01:17:56.136
as You will it.

01:17:56.138 --> 01:17:58.738
Father...

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:00.974
take this from me.

01:18:00.976 --> 01:18:03.276
Spare me.

01:18:05.379 --> 01:18:09.883
Lord, I know you are
pleased with me,

01:18:09.885 --> 01:18:13.420
for You sustain me in sincerity.

01:18:13.422 --> 01:18:16.756
We thank you, our ancestors,

01:18:16.758 --> 01:18:19.192
for watching over us.

01:18:20.061 --> 01:18:22.329
Father...

01:18:23.464 --> 01:18:25.932
<i>Praise the Lord...</i>

01:18:26.934 --> 01:18:30.303
God of Israel,

01:18:30.305 --> 01:18:34.174
everlasting and everlasting.

01:18:34.176 --> 01:18:38.011
Amen and amen.

01:18:50.791 --> 01:18:53.893
If You will it, Father...

01:18:59.667 --> 01:19:01.835
if You will it...

01:19:03.904 --> 01:19:07.707
Your will...

01:19:07.709 --> 01:19:09.809
is mine.

01:19:37.872 --> 01:19:40.306
Do what you came for.

01:19:49.083 --> 01:19:50.817
Traitor!

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:55.455
Take him!

01:20:01.496 --> 01:20:04.330
Run, Jesus, run!

01:20:08.736 --> 01:20:10.970
Run, Jesus!

01:20:17.012 --> 01:20:20.046
Run, Jesus, run!

01:20:20.048 --> 01:20:23.183
- Run, Jesus! Run!
- Peter.

01:20:23.185 --> 01:20:24.517
Peter.

01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:29.456
He who lives by the sword...

01:20:29.458 --> 01:20:31.624
dies by the sword.

01:21:18.306 --> 01:21:20.073
Run.

01:21:20.075 --> 01:21:23.209
Come on, you, move!
Move it!

01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:24.444
Take him back.

01:21:24.446 --> 01:21:26.079
What about this one?

01:21:26.081 --> 01:21:28.681
Get out of here!

01:21:34.022 --> 01:21:35.889
Come on.

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:38.525
- I won't leave him. Come on!
- Peter!

01:21:40.127 --> 01:21:41.694
Come on, Mary.

01:21:50.204 --> 01:21:52.005
Quickly!

01:21:55.644 --> 01:21:58.344
Keep him moving.

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:01.714
Quickly!

01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:14.561
- Tell Caiaphas we have Jesus.
- Yes, sir.

01:22:15.996 --> 01:22:17.430
Not you.

01:23:27.868 --> 01:23:30.303
You cannot go through with this.

01:23:30.305 --> 01:23:32.305
It is not legal.

01:23:32.307 --> 01:23:34.340
Our scholars say it
must be in court,

01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:36.476
in daylight, in public.
It is necessary.

01:23:36.478 --> 01:23:37.844
Why the rush?

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:39.345
You know why.

01:23:39.347 --> 01:23:42.415
Pilate will close the Temple.

01:23:42.417 --> 01:23:45.218
We must be rid of this Jesus.

01:23:47.054 --> 01:23:50.356
But what if he really
is who they say he is?

01:23:50.358 --> 01:23:53.326
We are to decide precisely that,

01:23:53.328 --> 01:23:56.129
now, with God's guidance.

01:23:56.131 --> 01:23:57.630
God demands we obey the Law!

01:23:57.632 --> 01:24:00.166
Let me remind you
what the Law says!

01:24:00.168 --> 01:24:05.071
"Anyone... who shows contempt
for the judge or for the priest

01:24:05.073 --> 01:24:06.940
shall be put to death."

01:24:08.008 --> 01:24:09.542
Anyone.

01:24:19.053 --> 01:24:23.289
Brothers... thank you for coming

01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:24.824
at this hour.

01:24:24.826 --> 01:24:27.593
You know I would not have asked you

01:24:27.595 --> 01:24:30.463
if it were not so serious.

01:24:31.866 --> 01:24:33.132
Ah.

01:24:47.549 --> 01:24:49.749
Get him up.

01:24:54.621 --> 01:24:57.490
Jesus of Nazareth...

01:24:57.492 --> 01:25:00.426
you are charged

01:25:00.428 --> 01:25:02.729
with blasphemy.

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:28.388
Mary?

01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:30.356
Mary.

01:25:32.226 --> 01:25:33.993
Oh!
Oh!

01:25:35.397 --> 01:25:38.331
What has happened?
Where is my son?

01:25:38.333 --> 01:25:41.134
- Jesus has been arrested.
- Arrested?

01:25:41.136 --> 01:25:44.604
But we don't know where
they have taken him.

01:25:44.606 --> 01:25:46.572
Arrested?

01:25:46.574 --> 01:25:48.341
At night?

01:25:48.343 --> 01:25:50.410
They want to keep it secret.

01:25:50.412 --> 01:25:52.545
They don't want any protests.

01:25:52.547 --> 01:25:54.914
He...

01:25:54.916 --> 01:25:56.983
has employed

01:25:56.985 --> 01:26:00.420
demons to heal.

01:26:00.422 --> 01:26:02.021
He...

01:26:02.023 --> 01:26:03.489
has threatened

01:26:03.491 --> 01:26:06.159
to destroy the Temple

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:09.729
of our Lord!

01:26:09.731 --> 01:26:12.331
But, brothers, we must listen

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:15.034
before we judge.

01:26:16.737 --> 01:26:19.205
And so I invite...

01:26:19.207 --> 01:26:21.140
the prophet

01:26:21.142 --> 01:26:23.509
to speak.

01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:27.947
Tell us the message
you bring from God.

01:26:31.752 --> 01:26:34.821
Nothing?

01:26:34.823 --> 01:26:38.691
Nothing to say?
Surely...

01:26:38.693 --> 01:26:41.961
Tell us this:

01:26:41.963 --> 01:26:44.530
Are you

01:26:44.532 --> 01:26:47.533
the Chosen One?

01:26:47.535 --> 01:26:50.203
Are you the Son of God?

01:26:54.608 --> 01:26:56.309
I am.

01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:05.918
And you will see me coming

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:08.054
with the clouds of Heaven,

01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:11.257
sitting at the right hand of God.

01:27:11.259 --> 01:27:13.326
This is repulsive!

01:27:13.328 --> 01:27:14.694
With God?!

01:27:14.696 --> 01:27:16.295
Imposter!

01:27:16.297 --> 01:27:18.097
Fool! Blasphemer!

01:27:24.571 --> 01:27:27.306
We have heard enough.

01:27:27.308 --> 01:27:30.877
There is only one verdict.

01:27:32.346 --> 01:27:34.013
Guilty.

01:27:44.992 --> 01:27:46.926
This is wrong!

01:27:46.928 --> 01:27:51.564
This brings shame on our council.

01:27:51.566 --> 01:27:53.332
Does it not?

01:28:20.827 --> 01:28:22.728
Let it be known,

01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:26.032
Jesus of Nazareth has been tried

01:28:26.034 --> 01:28:29.902
by the Supreme Court of Elders,

01:28:29.904 --> 01:28:31.604
and he has been found guilty

01:28:31.606 --> 01:28:34.006
of blasphemy

01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:38.811
and of threatening to
destroy the Temple.

01:28:38.813 --> 01:28:42.548
The sentence...

01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:43.583
is death!

01:28:45.553 --> 01:28:47.453
You!

01:28:47.455 --> 01:28:51.224
Take back your money!

01:29:04.304 --> 01:29:06.205
You.

01:29:07.741 --> 01:29:10.376
I've seen you before.
You know him.

01:29:16.451 --> 01:29:18.017
No.

01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:20.453
I don't know him.

01:29:20.455 --> 01:29:21.654
You called him Rabbi.

01:29:21.656 --> 01:29:23.522
He has nothing to do with me.

01:29:23.524 --> 01:29:27.026
- You know him.
- I've seen you with him.

01:29:29.029 --> 01:29:32.064
I don't know him.

01:29:36.703 --> 01:29:38.671
<i>Peter...</i>

01:29:38.673 --> 01:29:41.907
<i>you will deny me three times.</i>

01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:49.048
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:51.884
Take him to Pilate.

01:30:06.833 --> 01:30:08.901
Sir, the High Priest Caiaphas

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:11.504
and his elders are here to see you.

01:30:17.277 --> 01:30:20.212
Prefect, good morning.

01:30:22.784 --> 01:30:25.951
Prefect, we need your help.

01:30:27.187 --> 01:30:31.357
We have convicted a
dangerous criminal.

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:34.327
So? Execute him.

01:30:34.329 --> 01:30:36.729
We cannot.

01:30:36.731 --> 01:30:42.034
This is a tense time,
when my people

01:30:42.036 --> 01:30:47.139
celebrate their deliverance
from past oppressors.

01:30:47.141 --> 01:30:50.843
He claims to be our king...

01:30:50.845 --> 01:30:54.213
and is whipping up the
crowds into a rebellion,

01:30:54.215 --> 01:30:58.084
a rebellion that could
tear Jerusalem apart.

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:03.255
Caesar would not be pleased.

01:31:07.627 --> 01:31:09.662
His name?

01:31:09.664 --> 01:31:13.299
Jesus of Nazareth.

01:31:15.035 --> 01:31:18.337
You better not be wasting my time.

01:31:19.906 --> 01:31:23.042
I'll see the prisoner.

01:31:39.025 --> 01:31:40.760
So...

01:31:40.762 --> 01:31:42.561
tell me who you are.

01:31:43.797 --> 01:31:46.732
Are you the King of the Jews?

01:31:46.734 --> 01:31:49.235
Are you asking...

01:31:49.237 --> 01:31:52.371
or is it a question
coming from others?

01:31:55.108 --> 01:31:57.243
Are you a king?

01:31:57.245 --> 01:31:59.512
That's what your own people

01:31:59.514 --> 01:32:04.083
and Chief Priest tell
me you claim to be.

01:32:04.085 --> 01:32:07.486
My Kingdom...

01:32:07.488 --> 01:32:09.855
is not of this world.

01:32:09.857 --> 01:32:12.858
If it were,

01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:16.262
my servants would fight my arrest.

01:32:21.768 --> 01:32:25.171
My Kingdom is from another place.

01:32:45.026 --> 01:32:47.126
You are a king, then?

01:32:47.128 --> 01:32:49.562
You say that I am a king.

01:32:49.564 --> 01:32:53.833
I have been born and
come into the world

01:32:53.835 --> 01:32:55.768
to testify to the truth.

01:32:56.937 --> 01:32:59.772
Everyone on the side of truth...

01:33:00.841 --> 01:33:03.642
listens to me.

01:33:03.644 --> 01:33:05.578
Truth?

01:33:06.646 --> 01:33:08.614
What is truth?

01:33:24.665 --> 01:33:27.299
That's him.

01:33:27.301 --> 01:33:30.369
The man I saw in the
dream, that's him.

01:33:33.673 --> 01:33:35.774
They want him executed.

01:33:35.776 --> 01:33:37.009
You can't.

01:33:37.011 --> 01:33:39.545
They say he could
start a revolution.

01:33:39.547 --> 01:33:40.713
You mustn't!

01:33:40.715 --> 01:33:42.014
If I don't,

01:33:42.016 --> 01:33:45.184
Caiaphas will blame
any rebellion on me.

01:33:45.186 --> 01:33:47.753
And Caesar will see
it as my failure.

01:33:47.755 --> 01:33:52.324
He's warned me once; he's
not going to warn me again.

01:33:52.326 --> 01:33:54.293
I'll be finished.

01:33:56.963 --> 01:33:59.365
We'll be finished.

01:34:13.179 --> 01:34:16.916
He's guilty of nothing
more than being deluded.

01:34:16.918 --> 01:34:19.585
He has... broken the Law.

01:34:19.587 --> 01:34:21.253
Your law...

01:34:21.255 --> 01:34:22.821
not Caesar's.

01:34:24.658 --> 01:34:26.325
Prefect...

01:34:26.327 --> 01:34:29.862
we cannot be held responsible

01:34:29.864 --> 01:34:32.298
for what the people may do

01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:37.069
today, with their eyes on God,

01:34:37.071 --> 01:34:39.471
if you release a man

01:34:39.473 --> 01:34:43.309
who has broken our sacred laws.

01:34:44.210 --> 01:34:46.412
The people?

01:34:49.349 --> 01:34:51.584
Caesar decrees...

01:34:51.586 --> 01:34:54.353
I can release a
prisoner at Passover.

01:34:56.723 --> 01:34:58.424
Let the people decide

01:34:58.426 --> 01:35:02.061
which of the prisoners I
hold will be executed.

01:35:18.778 --> 01:35:20.179
Get him out

01:35:20.181 --> 01:35:22.047
and teach him some respect.

01:35:22.049 --> 01:35:23.549
40 lashes.

01:35:31.725 --> 01:35:35.327
Peter! Peter!

01:35:35.329 --> 01:35:37.429
What's happened?
Where's Jesus?

01:35:39.132 --> 01:35:41.500
Peter... Peter, where's my son?

01:35:44.804 --> 01:35:47.473
They've condemned him.

01:35:47.475 --> 01:35:50.009
- Peter, stop.
- Where are you going?

01:35:52.812 --> 01:35:54.813
I denied him.

01:35:54.815 --> 01:35:57.349
Three times.

01:36:12.699 --> 01:36:13.966
Come on!

01:36:20.207 --> 01:36:22.741
What have they done to him?

01:36:35.255 --> 01:36:37.423
They're going to kill him.

01:37:05.418 --> 01:37:08.020
It's as if he knows

01:37:08.022 --> 01:37:09.388
this must happen.

01:37:53.066 --> 01:37:55.334
<i>One of you here...</i>

01:37:57.171 --> 01:37:59.638
will betray me.

01:38:57.230 --> 01:38:58.463
Get up!

01:39:51.151 --> 01:39:53.518
So you're a king?

01:39:55.588 --> 01:39:58.891
Every king needs a crown.

01:40:01.327 --> 01:40:03.462
Get up.

01:40:07.166 --> 01:40:08.800
Come on!

01:40:10.037 --> 01:40:11.470
You...

01:40:11.472 --> 01:40:13.438
- Yes, you, yes.
- You and you. You.

01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:14.840
Go on.

01:40:14.842 --> 01:40:15.741
- Yes.
- You.

01:40:15.743 --> 01:40:17.876
No followers of Jesus!

01:40:17.878 --> 01:40:19.077
Stop. No, not you.

01:40:19.079 --> 01:40:20.545
Back, back.

01:40:20.547 --> 01:40:22.180
No.
Back!

01:40:22.182 --> 01:40:23.382
Step back.
Not you.

01:40:23.384 --> 01:40:25.050
Back!

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:27.320
Let me through!

01:40:27.321 --> 01:40:28.654
Back!
Oh!

01:40:35.028 --> 01:40:37.262
Close the gates!

01:40:39.667 --> 01:40:42.034
Hey, Mary!

01:40:42.036 --> 01:40:43.468
Mary, move.

01:40:43.470 --> 01:40:45.570
Move. Let's go.

01:40:53.613 --> 01:40:56.448
Today Passover begins,

01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:59.985
and your emperor, Tiberius
Caesar, makes you

01:40:59.987 --> 01:41:02.120
a gesture of goodwill.

01:41:02.122 --> 01:41:04.256
The release of a prisoner...

01:41:06.093 --> 01:41:08.961
chosen by you.

01:41:08.963 --> 01:41:11.596
I give you a choice.

01:41:11.598 --> 01:41:16.001
Barabbas, a dangerous agitator.

01:41:19.105 --> 01:41:20.672
Or this preacher...

01:41:22.141 --> 01:41:25.410
who claims to be your king.

01:41:29.615 --> 01:41:32.384
He is not our king!

01:41:38.224 --> 01:41:42.127
We have no king but Caesar.

01:41:44.097 --> 01:41:45.397
You must decide.

01:41:50.203 --> 01:41:52.604
Barabbas.

01:41:52.606 --> 01:41:54.906
Barabbas.

01:41:56.642 --> 01:41:58.643
- Barabbas!
- Free Barabbas!

01:42:00.447 --> 01:42:02.180
Give us Barabbas!

01:42:02.182 --> 01:42:03.715
Release Barabbas!

01:42:08.021 --> 01:42:10.789
Jesus! Jesus!

01:42:15.828 --> 01:42:18.030
You choose a murderer?

01:42:19.532 --> 01:42:21.266
Do it.

01:42:24.438 --> 01:42:26.772
Free Barabbas!

01:42:27.807 --> 01:42:29.775
Do it.

01:42:38.618 --> 01:42:41.086
And the prophet?

01:42:41.088 --> 01:42:45.857
How could this
blasphemer be our king?

01:42:49.695 --> 01:42:51.863
He's a false prophet!

01:42:51.865 --> 01:42:54.866
Crucify him!
Crucify him!

01:42:58.639 --> 01:43:00.005
Spare him!

01:43:00.007 --> 01:43:01.406
Save him!

01:43:02.475 --> 01:43:04.109
Kill him!

01:43:04.111 --> 01:43:06.311
Crucify him.

01:43:18.257 --> 01:43:21.493
Crucify him!
Crucify him!

01:43:24.897 --> 01:43:29.601
Crucify him!
Crucify him!

01:43:29.603 --> 01:43:34.639
Crucify him! Crucify him!

01:43:34.641 --> 01:43:36.808
Very well.

01:43:39.412 --> 01:43:40.979
Crucify him.

01:43:42.483 --> 01:43:43.515
No!

01:43:51.657 --> 01:43:53.859
No!

01:44:06.405 --> 01:44:08.006
You, go back!

01:44:11.044 --> 01:44:13.311
Back!

01:45:03.663 --> 01:45:04.763
Move!

01:45:25.651 --> 01:45:27.986
John, I need to see him.

01:45:27.988 --> 01:45:30.522
- I need to see my son.
- Get back!

01:45:30.524 --> 01:45:32.991
Get back! Get back!

01:46:20.906 --> 01:46:23.708
Somebody help him!

01:46:23.710 --> 01:46:25.577
Show him mercy!

01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:28.680
No!

01:46:28.682 --> 01:46:30.782
Get back!

01:46:30.784 --> 01:46:31.916
Stay back!

01:46:34.254 --> 01:46:36.154
My son.

01:46:36.989 --> 01:46:38.857
Don't be afraid.

01:46:38.859 --> 01:46:41.826
Everything is possible

01:46:41.828 --> 01:46:44.562
with God.

01:46:47.967 --> 01:46:51.569
That's it, pull her back!

01:47:03.549 --> 01:47:04.883
Move forward!

01:47:04.885 --> 01:47:07.319
Oh, Jesus.

01:47:07.321 --> 01:47:08.953
Jesus.

01:47:08.955 --> 01:47:10.188
Please, she's his mother!

01:47:28.641 --> 01:47:30.608
Get back!

01:47:37.450 --> 01:47:39.651
Get back!

01:47:39.653 --> 01:47:41.119
Please!

01:47:41.121 --> 01:47:42.754
You!

01:47:44.657 --> 01:47:46.591
You!

01:47:46.593 --> 01:47:48.493
Help him carry the cross.

01:47:48.495 --> 01:47:50.462
Move!

01:47:55.634 --> 01:47:57.569
My Lord.

01:48:46.952 --> 01:48:51.856
What will the sign on
his cross say, Prefect?

01:48:55.094 --> 01:48:58.129
Put in Aramaic, Latin and Greek,

01:48:58.131 --> 01:49:00.799
"Jesus of Nazareth,

01:49:00.801 --> 01:49:02.801
the King of the Jews."

01:49:02.803 --> 01:49:04.702
He was never our king.

01:49:04.704 --> 01:49:06.671
It must read,

01:49:06.673 --> 01:49:08.306
"This man said,

01:49:08.308 --> 01:49:11.776
'I am the King of the Jews.'"

01:49:11.778 --> 01:49:13.311
It stays as I've commanded:

01:49:13.313 --> 01:49:16.414
"The King of the Jews."

01:49:33.232 --> 01:49:35.099
This is unjust!

01:49:35.101 --> 01:49:36.835
Help him!

01:49:49.815 --> 01:49:52.150
Release him!

01:49:52.152 --> 01:49:54.719
Get away!

01:49:54.721 --> 01:49:56.421
Get away from him!

01:50:17.977 --> 01:50:19.477
Bless you.

01:50:19.479 --> 01:50:21.679
Thank you.

01:50:40.033 --> 01:50:42.400
Come on!

01:50:44.637 --> 01:50:46.838
Come on, move!
Come on.

01:50:53.879 --> 01:50:54.946
Move!

01:50:54.948 --> 01:50:56.548
Come on, hey!

01:50:58.517 --> 01:51:01.486
Come on!

01:51:22.174 --> 01:51:24.676
You!

01:51:24.678 --> 01:51:27.445
Leave! Leave!

01:51:27.447 --> 01:51:28.580
Move!

01:51:31.817 --> 01:51:33.851
Come on, King!

01:51:33.853 --> 01:51:36.821
Come on!

01:51:39.526 --> 01:51:41.326
Come on!

01:51:47.199 --> 01:51:48.833
Look at him!

01:51:56.809 --> 01:51:59.210
Pin him up on the cross!

01:52:02.681 --> 01:52:04.682
Come on!

01:52:04.684 --> 01:52:06.751
No further.

01:52:38.917 --> 01:52:40.885
Secure the ropes!

01:53:41.447 --> 01:53:44.315
You'll live to regret this.

01:53:44.317 --> 01:53:47.051
Hardly the first Jew we've killed.

01:53:47.053 --> 01:53:49.387
He was different.

01:53:49.389 --> 01:53:53.191
He was chosen by the gods.

01:53:53.193 --> 01:53:55.026
He thought he was.

01:53:56.161 --> 01:53:59.664
He'll be forgotten in a week.

01:54:09.274 --> 01:54:10.975
Lift! Get him up there!

01:54:13.946 --> 01:54:15.079
Steady.

01:54:27.226 --> 01:54:28.860
Steady!

01:55:30.422 --> 01:55:32.590
My son...

01:55:37.396 --> 01:55:39.263
King of the Jews!

01:55:39.265 --> 01:55:42.166
Can you see the Temple from there?

01:55:42.168 --> 01:55:44.468
Leave him!

01:55:46.606 --> 01:55:49.473
Father...

01:55:49.475 --> 01:55:52.310
Father...

01:55:52.312 --> 01:55:54.645
forgive them.

01:55:57.449 --> 01:56:00.284
For they know not what they do.

01:56:39.291 --> 01:56:41.492
Aren't you the Messiah?

01:56:41.494 --> 01:56:45.630
Why don't you save yourself and us?

01:56:46.765 --> 01:56:50.568
Our punishment is just,

01:56:50.570 --> 01:56:53.070
but this man

01:56:53.072 --> 01:56:55.873
has done nothing wrong.

01:56:56.775 --> 01:56:59.644
Remember me when you come

01:56:59.646 --> 01:57:01.812
into your Kingdom.

01:57:02.648 --> 01:57:05.016
Truly, I say to you,

01:57:05.018 --> 01:57:07.485
today...

01:57:07.487 --> 01:57:10.655
you will be

01:57:10.657 --> 01:57:13.257
with me in Paradise.

01:57:29.074 --> 01:57:31.042
Mother...

01:57:33.145 --> 01:57:35.680
this is your son.

01:57:36.515 --> 01:57:38.316
John...

01:57:38.318 --> 01:57:40.818
this is your mother.

01:57:47.092 --> 01:57:49.060
My God.

01:57:52.030 --> 01:57:53.965
My God.

01:57:55.801 --> 01:57:58.402
Why have You forsaken me?

01:58:07.512 --> 01:58:09.747
I thirst.

02:00:15.474 --> 02:00:18.242
It's finished.

02:01:11.196 --> 02:01:13.931
Father...

02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:18.536
into Your hands...

02:01:20.540 --> 02:01:22.606
I commend my spirit.

02:01:43.261 --> 02:01:44.461
Claudia!

02:01:44.463 --> 02:01:46.297
This is an omen!

02:04:58.690 --> 02:05:00.758
Where were you?

02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:03.594
You were supposed to be his rock.

02:05:05.797 --> 02:05:07.765
I failed him.

02:05:11.169 --> 02:05:14.338
Now I can't ask him to forgive me.

02:06:06.291 --> 02:06:08.792
Who are you looking for?

02:06:11.363 --> 02:06:13.464
If you've taken him,
tell me where he is.

02:06:14.532 --> 02:06:16.667
Mary.

02:06:20.972 --> 02:06:22.372
Teacher?

02:06:22.374 --> 02:06:24.942
Go and tell our brothers...

02:06:24.944 --> 02:06:27.644
I am here.

02:06:36.855 --> 02:06:40.123
Peter! Peter!

02:06:40.125 --> 02:06:41.625
Everyone!

02:06:41.627 --> 02:06:43.060
The tomb is open.

02:06:43.062 --> 02:06:44.728
- He's alive.
- What?

02:06:44.730 --> 02:06:46.630
That's not possible.

02:06:46.632 --> 02:06:49.967
I saw him.
Mary, maybe it was someone else.

02:06:49.969 --> 02:06:52.736
You think I'm mad.

02:06:52.738 --> 02:06:54.338
Peter...

02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:56.707
see the tomb for yourself.

02:07:14.826 --> 02:07:17.794
Now do you believe me?

02:07:25.570 --> 02:07:28.405
But he's gone.

02:07:28.407 --> 02:07:29.907
Gone?

02:07:31.476 --> 02:07:32.876
No.

02:07:35.814 --> 02:07:37.447
He's back.

02:07:46.057 --> 02:07:47.925
Thank you.

02:07:50.862 --> 02:07:53.864
A cup. I need a cup and some wine.

02:07:54.999 --> 02:07:56.900
What happened?

02:07:56.902 --> 02:07:58.569
His body.

02:08:03.575 --> 02:08:04.675
His blood.

02:08:12.650 --> 02:08:14.318
"I am the way...

02:08:16.721 --> 02:08:18.722
"...the truth...

02:08:18.724 --> 02:08:21.291
and the life."

02:08:34.672 --> 02:08:36.473
No.

02:08:38.242 --> 02:08:40.777
No, this isn't real.

02:08:57.962 --> 02:08:59.529
Thomas.

02:09:02.300 --> 02:09:05.369
Stop doubting.

02:09:24.188 --> 02:09:27.791
And believe.

02:09:29.961 --> 02:09:32.329
It is you.

02:09:32.331 --> 02:09:34.865
Because you see me,

02:09:34.867 --> 02:09:37.100
you believe.

02:09:37.102 --> 02:09:39.002
Blessed are those

02:09:39.004 --> 02:09:43.006
who have not seen me...

02:09:43.008 --> 02:09:45.108
and yet...

02:09:45.110 --> 02:09:47.611
have believed.

02:10:05.229 --> 02:10:08.498
When the Holy Spirit comes to you,

02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:11.168
you'll receive power.

02:10:11.170 --> 02:10:15.572
The power of the Holy Spirit

02:10:15.574 --> 02:10:19.509
can be with you all
wherever you are.

02:10:19.511 --> 02:10:22.312
Go into the world

02:10:22.314 --> 02:10:25.482
and preach the Gospel
to all creation.

02:10:28.219 --> 02:10:30.721
Peace be with you.

02:10:55.813 --> 02:10:58.482
My brothers, my sisters...

02:10:58.484 --> 02:11:00.784
we have work to do.

02:11:15.868 --> 02:11:18.735
<i>With Peter as our leader,</i>

02:11:18.737 --> 02:11:23.006
<i>we spread the Word of Jesus
throughout the world,</i>

02:11:23.008 --> 02:11:25.041
shining the light

02:11:25.043 --> 02:11:27.844
on all creation.

02:11:39.323 --> 02:11:41.558
But in the light,

02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:44.461
there was darkness.

02:11:44.463 --> 02:11:46.997
<i>Persecuted for our preaching,</i>

02:11:46.999 --> 02:11:50.600
<i>all of the disciples
died for our cause...</i>

02:11:52.537 --> 02:11:54.571
except one.

02:11:56.741 --> 02:12:00.043
<i>I must live out my days in exile...</i>

02:12:01.078 --> 02:12:03.046
alone.

02:12:07.819 --> 02:12:09.586
One day...

02:12:09.588 --> 02:12:13.356
<i>I hope to see my friends again...</i>

02:12:13.358 --> 02:12:16.927
for they are with Our Lord.

02:12:21.966 --> 02:12:24.334
The people today...

02:12:24.336 --> 02:12:26.803
they called you "King."

02:12:26.805 --> 02:12:29.039
They think you are the Messiah.

02:12:29.041 --> 02:12:32.342
Who do you think I am?

02:12:32.344 --> 02:12:34.778
You are the Son of God.

02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:36.546
What if he's not the one?

02:12:36.548 --> 02:12:39.149
We're risking our lives, for what?

02:12:39.151 --> 02:12:41.685
He has shown us his power;
we must have faith in him.

02:12:41.687 --> 02:12:44.921
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

02:12:46.424 --> 02:12:49.192
Trust in God.

02:12:50.461 --> 02:12:53.296
Trust in me, also.

02:12:56.033 --> 02:12:59.669
<i>You know the way to
where I'm going.</i>

02:13:01.305 --> 02:13:04.140
We don't know where you're going...
how can we know the way?

02:13:04.142 --> 02:13:06.576
I am the way...

02:13:06.578 --> 02:13:08.612
the truth...

02:13:08.614 --> 02:13:11.114
and the life.

02:13:13.017 --> 02:13:15.619
I am the Alpha...

02:13:15.621 --> 02:13:18.188
and the Omega,

02:13:18.190 --> 02:13:20.357
the first...

02:13:20.359 --> 02:13:22.826
and the last...

02:13:26.632 --> 02:13:29.900
the beginning...

02:13:29.902 --> 02:13:31.635
and the end.

02:13:31.637 --> 02:13:34.704
I knew it!

02:13:34.706 --> 02:13:36.973
I've been expecting death to come.

02:13:36.975 --> 02:13:39.242
There will be no more death...

02:13:40.311 --> 02:13:43.213
or mourning...

02:13:43.215 --> 02:13:44.748
or crying...

02:13:46.384 --> 02:13:48.318
or pain.

02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:51.254
I am making everything new.

02:13:52.791 --> 02:13:54.291
Yes.

02:13:56.460 --> 02:13:58.628
I am coming soon.

02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:04.567
May the grace of the Lord

02:14:04.569 --> 02:14:07.938
be with all God's people.

02:14:10.141 --> 02:14:12.409
Amen.
