M_I_SForEver

01:37.592 --> 01:39.026
Yeah.

01:39.059 --> 01:40.559
Michael.

01:40.592 --> 01:43.592
What did I say about flying
out-of-bounds during recess?

01:43.625 --> 01:46.027
Let's keep it below
ten feet, mister.

01:46.060 --> 01:47.094
Sorry, miss.

02:00.026 --> 02:04.392
Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six...

02:04.425 --> 02:06.027
I see you, Daniel Furbank.

02:06.426 --> 02:07.994
Eyes closed.

02:08.026 --> 02:09.491
I wasn't peeking.

02:09.525 --> 02:10.693
Yes, you were.

02:10.726 --> 02:12.159
Start again, please.

02:14.593 --> 02:16.994
Ten, nine...

02:17.026 --> 02:18.660
You better get moving,
Mr. Burrows.

02:36.459 --> 02:38.227
Hide somewhere else.

02:39.626 --> 02:41.260
Nope, not here.

02:42.026 --> 02:43.593
Spot's taken, new kid.

02:51.293 --> 02:56.627
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

02:57.727 --> 03:02.492
...six, five, four,

03:02.526 --> 03:08.326
three, two, one.

03:10.092 --> 03:12.193
Ready or not,
here I come.

03:14.325 --> 03:15.660
Morning, team.

03:15.692 --> 03:18.359
I hope everyone is
rested and ready to dig.

03:18.392 --> 03:20.492
Today, we are
starting construction

03:20.526 --> 03:22.661
on a very important project.

03:25.093 --> 03:27.527
Teddy, the blueprints, please.

03:27.560 --> 03:28.693
Right, let's see...

03:30.593 --> 03:32.659
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

03:32.693 --> 03:34.226
These seem to be in order.

03:34.258 --> 03:36.326
Time to check
our safety signs.

03:40.592 --> 03:43.694
Mmm-hmm,
everything seems to be up to code.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.225
Wait.

03:46.258 --> 03:48.992
We're missing
the most important sign.

03:55.992 --> 03:57.960
"No boys allowed."

03:57.993 --> 03:59.360
Perfect.

04:02.226 --> 04:03.327
Huh?

04:08.359 --> 04:09.992
What are you doing in here?

04:11.625 --> 04:13.059
I'm hiding.

04:13.092 --> 04:15.125
You can't hide in here.

04:15.158 --> 04:16.660
Didn't you read the sign?

04:17.524 --> 04:19.959
Uh, what sign?

04:23.392 --> 04:25.292
This is a supersecret fort.

04:25.325 --> 04:28.992
But it's not super-secret
if you know about it.

04:29.493 --> 04:31.026
I, uh...

04:31.058 --> 04:33.493
I'm sorry,
I just moved here.

04:33.525 --> 04:35.092
It's my first day.

04:36.992 --> 04:39.293
So, are you staying
here for long?

04:39.325 --> 04:42.359
Well, my parents really
like Sanctuary City.

04:42.393 --> 04:44.661
So, hopefully for a while.

04:46.058 --> 04:47.427
I mean in my fort.

04:48.325 --> 04:50.026
Oh. Right.

04:50.559 --> 04:52.093
That's okay.

04:52.126 --> 04:54.127
I can find
somewhere else to hide.

04:55.559 --> 04:59.493
Well, I guess it is a waste
of a good hiding spot.

05:00.258 --> 05:02.326
We've decided you can stay.

05:09.760 --> 05:13.460
Besides, we could always use
another worker on the team.

05:14.660 --> 05:16.193
Maggie Diggins.

05:17.058 --> 05:19.393
I kinda run things
around here.

05:21.460 --> 05:22.494
Bradley Burrows.

05:27.293 --> 05:29.293
Can I go on
lunch now, boss?

05:29.325 --> 05:31.326
Mmm, sure.

05:33.326 --> 05:35.026
What's that?

05:35.059 --> 05:38.293
Uh, it's a Bush Bar.
Would you like some?

05:38.325 --> 05:41.260
- Ew.
- Come on. You'll love it.

05:42.293 --> 05:43.559
We can share.

05:43.592 --> 05:44.627
Okay.

05:47.259 --> 05:48.294
Um...

05:50.492 --> 05:53.693
Maybe we can
share one bar.

06:47.059 --> 06:51.260
All right.
All done here. So...

06:51.293 --> 06:53.193
What should we
hang here next?

06:53.226 --> 06:55.393
Hmm...

06:55.426 --> 06:58.160
A photo of us
eating Bush Bars?

06:58.193 --> 07:00.060
Good idea.
Keeps things fresh.

07:05.325 --> 07:07.126
I'm just happy
that we finally have

07:07.159 --> 07:10.193
our own
super-secret fort.

07:12.126 --> 07:14.260
Speaking of,
I better get to work

07:14.292 --> 07:17.025
if we wanna keep
this fort over our heads.

07:17.058 --> 07:21.292
My boss is very strict
when it comes to tardiness.

07:22.693 --> 07:25.060
I'm sure
she'll give you a pass.

07:26.092 --> 07:27.560
I'll race you
to the job site?

07:27.592 --> 07:29.359
Loser has to cook dinner.

07:32.026 --> 07:33.527
We didn't say go yet!

07:35.059 --> 07:38.027
Hope you like
deep-fried Bush Bars!

07:55.492 --> 07:56.526
Hurry up!

07:58.193 --> 07:59.993
Bring in Cuddly Cub.

08:09.525 --> 08:12.393
So, what are you cooking
for dinner tonight?

08:15.092 --> 08:16.660
Watch out!

08:25.758 --> 08:29.126
Is it me,
or do those guys seem to be...

08:29.159 --> 08:31.060
Terrible at their job?

08:31.092 --> 08:34.226
I was gonna
say "inexperienced",

08:34.258 --> 08:37.259
but, yes, that'll work too.

08:45.559 --> 08:48.092
Bradley, did you feel that?

08:48.659 --> 08:49.992
I felt it.

09:03.059 --> 09:05.294
Maggie, sweetheart,
we need to leave.

09:13.759 --> 09:15.627
This way. Quickly.

09:23.992 --> 09:27.592
Bradley, no! We're...
Bradley, we're trapped!

09:27.626 --> 09:30.659
There's no way out!
What are we gonna do Bradley?

09:30.691 --> 09:32.992
We just have
to think with our claws.

09:33.026 --> 09:34.092
Trust me.

09:35.259 --> 09:36.359
Uh.

09:40.691 --> 09:42.459
Ah! I have a plan!

10:07.293 --> 10:08.693
Mags, through here!

10:10.526 --> 10:12.494
Go! I'm right behind you!

10:15.225 --> 10:18.192
Bradley, I'm stuck!
I can't get through.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.060
Hang on!

11:01.492 --> 11:03.526
No, no. Bradley?

11:03.559 --> 11:04.693
Bradley.

11:04.726 --> 11:08.026
Bradley, where are you?

11:08.059 --> 11:09.394
No, Bradley.

11:11.192 --> 11:13.026
Over here!

11:13.059 --> 11:14.625
I've got another one!

11:14.659 --> 11:17.326
No, let go of me!

11:17.359 --> 11:20.427
Miss, I... I need you to
relax while I save you.

11:20.460 --> 11:22.427
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no.

11:22.460 --> 11:23.492
Bradley?

11:26.292 --> 11:27.460
Bradley!

11:27.493 --> 11:29.226
No!

11:29.259 --> 11:31.460
We've got a hyperventilating
wombat here.

11:31.493 --> 11:32.526
We need oxygen!

11:32.559 --> 11:34.092
Let go of me!

11:34.126 --> 11:35.993
I don't need oxygen!
I need to...

11:36.026 --> 11:37.559
I need to find my husb...

11:37.592 --> 11:40.259
Don't worry, ma'am,
you're safe now.

11:40.293 --> 11:42.525
You've got the Flightless
Feather to thank for that.

11:42.559 --> 11:44.125
Where are we
with that oxygen?

11:44.159 --> 11:46.494
I don't need ox...

11:49.226 --> 11:51.060
It's okay, madam.

11:51.093 --> 11:52.227
You're safe now.

12:02.159 --> 12:05.260
<i>Are you sick of being bullied
with the taunt, "chicken legs, chicken legs,</i>

12:05.292 --> 12:06.659
<i>check out his chicken legs"?</i>

12:06.692 --> 12:09.225
<i>Well, down some
Cass Mass Protein Powder</i>

12:09.259 --> 12:12.093
<i>and you'll have the calves
of a Cassowary King.</i>

12:13.293 --> 12:15.260
<i>Cass Mass Protein Powder.</i>

12:25.026 --> 12:26.659
<i>Breaking news this morning.</i>

12:33.293 --> 12:36.693
<i>Flightless
Feather saves the day once again.</i>

13:29.226 --> 13:30.226
Huh?

13:30.658 --> 13:31.926
Brad?

13:32.559 --> 13:33.660
Bradley?

13:35.058 --> 13:36.092
Bradley?

13:39.058 --> 13:40.092
Huh?

13:49.193 --> 13:50.259
Ah.

13:57.159 --> 13:58.260
Pizza!

14:04.125 --> 14:07.059
I can't believe you, Maggie.

14:07.093 --> 14:09.559
Unlawful entry. Property damage.

14:09.591 --> 14:11.358
Digging without
a safety permit.

14:12.193 --> 14:13.927
What's this?

14:14.492 --> 14:16.226
Theft?

14:16.258 --> 14:18.992
I may have eaten
a slice of their pizza.

14:22.326 --> 14:25.993
What's it gonna take
for you to stop searching?

14:26.391 --> 14:28.359
Finding him.

14:28.392 --> 14:32.159
Maggie! I know this is incredibly
difficult for you to accept, but...

14:33.591 --> 14:35.725
Look, I just...

14:35.758 --> 14:37.425
I don't know what else
can be done.

14:42.092 --> 14:43.359
I wanna read the case file.

14:43.392 --> 14:45.992
This again.

14:46.025 --> 14:48.259
I dug those tunnels,
and I don't make mistakes.

14:48.292 --> 14:50.358
There's gotta be
something in there.

14:50.391 --> 14:53.292
You have photographs,
witness statements.

14:53.325 --> 14:55.558
It was an accident, Maggie!

14:55.592 --> 14:59.492
Regardless, those files are
for law enforcement only.

14:59.525 --> 15:01.393
And the Flightless Feather?

15:04.225 --> 15:05.259
Uh...

15:05.293 --> 15:07.260
He's a superhero,
Maggie!

15:07.293 --> 15:09.093
He enforces the law.

15:09.126 --> 15:11.592
If he was such a hero,
Bradley would still be here.

15:11.624 --> 15:13.526
And I wouldn't be
getting a lecture from you!

15:13.559 --> 15:16.526
This isn't a lecture!

15:17.425 --> 15:20.492
It's a friendly chat. Huh?

15:20.524 --> 15:23.125
Friendly chats
don't involve handcuffs.

15:23.158 --> 15:25.591
Ha! You know very well
those handcuffs

15:25.624 --> 15:27.125
are so you don't eat
my din...

15:27.158 --> 15:29.160
Huh?

15:35.725 --> 15:37.693
You were right
to use the handcuffs.

15:40.192 --> 15:42.325
When are you gonna find
another job, hmm?

15:43.726 --> 15:45.226
There's plenty out there.

15:45.258 --> 15:48.226
I don't need
to find another job.

15:48.257 --> 15:50.391
I need to find Bradley.

15:50.425 --> 15:52.626
It's been six months, Maggie!

15:52.659 --> 15:54.993
What are you
really hoping to find?

15:57.225 --> 15:58.392
My life.

16:00.591 --> 16:02.658
<i>Good evening.
I'm Regina Rogers.</i>

16:02.692 --> 16:05.160
<i>Tonight's top story,
the Flightless Feather</i>

16:05.192 --> 16:08.458
<i>has once again foiled another
brazen robbery attempt,</i>

16:08.491 --> 16:12.458
<i>this time at Marsoupial
Kitchen in the city's south.</i>

16:12.491 --> 16:14.459
<i>It's the fifth incident
this month</i>

16:14.492 --> 16:18.259
<i>by the group being dubbed
the Bushy Tail Bandits.</i>

16:18.292 --> 16:22.126
<i>We've identified their calling
card, which is a hair ball.</i>

16:22.159 --> 16:23.591
<i>Mmm, gross.</i>

16:23.624 --> 16:26.959
<i>We spoke with local possum
earlier today,</i>

16:26.992 --> 16:29.125
<i>who was present during
the attempted robbery.</i>

16:29.158 --> 16:32.225
<i>Well, uh, I was getting
the soup of the day bro</i>

16:32.258 --> 16:34.291
<i>and these robbers
burst into the kitchen.</i>

16:34.325 --> 16:36.093
<i>But they...</i>

16:36.126 --> 16:39.526
<i>But they didn't realize
that this soup, a hero,</i>

16:39.559 --> 16:41.392
<i>was on the menu. Mmm-hmm.</i>

16:41.424 --> 16:44.591
<i>Another verbal treat
for our viewers at home.</i>

16:44.624 --> 16:47.625
<i>Well, you know what
else is a treat, Reggie?</i>

16:47.658 --> 16:51.391
<i>Zoom Plume, for keeping my
feathers smooth and aerodynamic.</i>

16:52.759 --> 16:54.992
I'm so sick
of your stupid face.

17:21.657 --> 17:24.358
Well, this won't
get me through the night.

17:27.325 --> 17:31.025
Oh, no!
We are being robbed!

17:31.059 --> 17:32.226
Somebody help us!

17:33.591 --> 17:36.125
- <i>Cassowary Kick.</i>
- Oh, my sugar drops.

17:36.158 --> 17:37.626
Oh, my sugar drops!

17:37.659 --> 17:39.126
It's Flightless Feather!

17:39.158 --> 17:41.025
He came to save us!

17:41.059 --> 17:42.526
It's your arch nemesis...

17:42.559 --> 17:44.592
Monsieur Peabody!

17:44.625 --> 17:50.693
Monsieur Flightless, it's
time for you to rest in "peas."

17:53.291 --> 17:55.625
How will Flightless
Feather get out of this one?

17:55.659 --> 17:58.093
Bingo, bango,
that's my mango.

17:59.025 --> 18:00.658
Oh, well, fear not.

18:00.692 --> 18:04.259
Here comes his trusty sidekick,
the Gallant Glider,

18:04.291 --> 18:05.692
to offer support
from the sky.

18:05.726 --> 18:06.959
Whoosh!

18:06.993 --> 18:08.559
Super speed engaged.

18:08.591 --> 18:10.025
Dun-na-na-na!

18:10.059 --> 18:12.592
End of the line, bandit scum!

18:25.292 --> 18:26.393
Ow!

18:35.225 --> 18:37.060
Hello!

18:39.324 --> 18:42.125
Please no small talk, please no small
talk, please no small talk.

18:42.157 --> 18:45.959
Welcome to Owlways Open,
where our prices are hooting mad.

18:45.993 --> 18:47.092
Hoot may I help you?

18:47.125 --> 18:49.459
Oh.

18:49.492 --> 18:53.225
Well, we have lots of hoot, hoot,
hooting deals going on at Owlways Open.

18:53.258 --> 18:55.359
We've got two-for-one
Flightless Featherade,

18:55.391 --> 18:57.426
hooty percentage off
Flightless Candy Bars.

18:59.425 --> 19:01.392
Hoot.

19:01.424 --> 19:04.391
Can I at least interest you
in some new Flightless Chili?

19:08.993 --> 19:09.992
Oh!

19:10.625 --> 19:13.027
All righty, just a moment.

19:14.525 --> 19:16.626
Drop bears!

19:17.425 --> 19:18.960
No!

19:18.992 --> 19:21.491
Aren't you three
just the cutest?

19:21.525 --> 19:24.092
How can I help you?

19:27.524 --> 19:29.959
Aw, you're thirsty.

19:29.992 --> 19:32.325
Oh, look, they're thirsty.

19:32.359 --> 19:33.392
Isn't that cute?

19:36.625 --> 19:39.592
You know, people used
to call me cute.

19:39.625 --> 19:42.226
That was before
I got my glasses.

19:47.458 --> 19:49.658
They say carrots are really
good for your eyesight.

19:49.692 --> 19:52.592
I can't eat carrots
because they hurt my teeth.

20:01.558 --> 20:04.659
Well, that wasn't so cu...

20:09.325 --> 20:10.392
That definitely isn't cute!

20:23.324 --> 20:24.692
Do you need a hand with...

20:25.723 --> 20:27.125
I'll be with you
in just a moment.

20:27.658 --> 20:28.959
Okay, uh...

20:28.991 --> 20:30.125
Ow, ow!

20:37.592 --> 20:39.726
Hey, hey, little drop bear?

20:39.758 --> 20:42.658
Get down from there! No, no, no.
You're not allowed to do that.

20:42.691 --> 20:46.091
No, no, please don't eat the chips!
No! No, no!

20:46.125 --> 20:48.025
Not my hat!
You've crossed the line!

20:48.057 --> 20:49.558
Please, please give me
my hat back!

20:49.592 --> 20:50.992
I love that hat!

20:51.024 --> 20:53.458
Aha! Gotcha! See?

20:53.492 --> 20:55.459
Everything is under control!

20:55.492 --> 20:57.625
Wait, what?

20:57.659 --> 20:59.992
Stop wriggling!

21:24.392 --> 21:26.693
Well, that's an unfortunate
turn of events.

21:32.656 --> 21:34.091
I was just saying
that Mr. Owlett

21:34.125 --> 21:37.359
wouldn't be very happy giving
away his food for free?

21:37.392 --> 21:40.024
Let me call head office
and I'll...

21:40.058 --> 21:41.526
No, no, no!

21:41.559 --> 21:43.192
Please don't eat me.

21:43.224 --> 21:45.326
Please don't eat me!
Please don't eat me!

21:45.358 --> 21:48.025
Let go of the Bush Bars!

21:49.425 --> 21:53.492
And the kid too, I guess.
You should probably put him down too.

21:54.592 --> 21:56.026
Huh?

22:01.591 --> 22:04.058
Ooh, Eucalyptus!

22:14.258 --> 22:16.391
Oi, buddy!

22:16.424 --> 22:18.425
How ya doin'?

22:19.058 --> 22:20.326
Uh-oh.

22:34.691 --> 22:39.258
That was awesome!

22:43.157 --> 22:44.659
I am so fired.

22:54.124 --> 22:55.291
Oh, my sugar drops!

22:55.324 --> 22:58.024
You were so, so cool!

22:58.058 --> 22:59.726
You were like,
whoosh, whoosh.

22:59.759 --> 23:02.492
Oh, and then, he tried
to slice you, shoo, shoo.

23:02.525 --> 23:04.459
Yeah, yeah, I remember.

23:04.491 --> 23:07.124
But you were just like,
"I don't think so.

23:07.158 --> 23:09.392
My butt, your face."

23:09.425 --> 23:10.591
Pwah!

23:10.625 --> 23:14.059
Yes, I'm aware.
I was there too.

23:15.359 --> 23:16.992
I'm Sweetie, by the way.

23:17.024 --> 23:18.426
Sweetie?

23:18.458 --> 23:20.024
That's what
my parents call me.

23:20.058 --> 23:22.058
You know like,
"Good night, Sweetie."

23:22.092 --> 23:24.192
My friends call me
Sweetie as well.

23:24.225 --> 23:27.091
Oh, well,
that is if I had friends.

23:28.591 --> 23:30.391
So...

23:30.424 --> 23:32.191
What's your name?

23:32.225 --> 23:34.226
Uh... Babushka!

23:35.091 --> 23:37.492
Babushka the Wombat.

23:37.524 --> 23:39.259
No!

23:39.291 --> 23:42.526
Shh! No, no, no.
I meant your alias, Babushka.

23:42.558 --> 23:46.191
A superhero should never
reveal their true name.

23:46.224 --> 23:48.592
Yeah, I'm not
a superhero, kid.

23:50.157 --> 23:52.291
But you saved the day,
Babushka.

23:52.324 --> 23:54.525
Yeah, really regretting
that name choice now.

23:56.157 --> 23:58.525
But that's what
superheroes do. See?

23:58.559 --> 24:03.325
Step 16 to being a superhero:
Save the day!

24:03.359 --> 24:05.225
That's what you did!

24:05.257 --> 24:08.458
Okay, so I intervened,
but that doesn't make me a superh...

24:08.491 --> 24:11.491
But having a superhero name
is the most important step.

24:11.525 --> 24:13.693
You can't be a superhero
without a name.

24:13.726 --> 24:16.392
Not a superhero.
Don't need a name.

24:16.425 --> 24:17.725
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

24:17.758 --> 24:20.159
How about Butt Woman?

24:20.191 --> 24:22.391
Oh. No.

24:22.425 --> 24:26.592
Or Super-Incredibly-Strong-Butt
Wombat!

24:26.625 --> 24:28.726
No, no, that's too long.

24:28.758 --> 24:32.492
Oh! But Flightless says you need a
name that should match your powers,

24:32.525 --> 24:35.391
so we need something for
those awesome butt moves.

24:35.425 --> 24:37.192
I've got it!

24:37.224 --> 24:39.959
I've got it. I've got it!
This is it. This is it.

24:39.991 --> 24:41.258
Da-na-na-na!

24:41.292 --> 24:44.359
Combat Wombat!

24:44.391 --> 24:46.724
Well,
this is me right here.

24:46.758 --> 24:48.926
Nice meeting you. Bye.

24:50.659 --> 24:52.158
Is this really your house?

24:52.191 --> 24:53.525
Yes.

24:55.192 --> 24:58.025
Babushka...

24:58.057 --> 25:00.125
My name isn't even Babushka!

25:00.659 --> 25:02.025
It's Maggie!

25:02.425 --> 25:04.492
Ooh!

25:04.524 --> 25:06.625
A secret identity.

25:06.658 --> 25:10.291
Anyway, I realized that
you don't have a sidekick.

25:10.324 --> 25:11.958
And I'd make a great one.

25:11.992 --> 25:13.658
Ready for the name?
Ready for the name?

25:13.691 --> 25:17.426
The Gallant Glider!

25:18.325 --> 25:19.659
Say what?

25:19.690 --> 25:22.024
We should hit
the streets later.

25:22.058 --> 25:24.725
Me soaring through the sky,
keeping an eye on you from above.

25:24.758 --> 25:26.526
What do you say?

25:26.558 --> 25:29.159
I'm not going out
looking for trouble.

25:29.191 --> 25:32.492
And neither should you.
You're too young for that.

25:32.524 --> 25:34.291
Too young?

25:34.325 --> 25:36.259
In case you haven't noticed,
I have a mustache!

25:40.725 --> 25:44.291
Flightless says
anyone can be a hero. See?

25:44.325 --> 25:45.526
Chapter fiftee...

25:45.558 --> 25:47.159
Well, I'm closing
this chapter.

25:47.191 --> 25:49.025
And by that I mean,
our brief...

25:49.057 --> 25:50.325
whatever this has been.

25:50.359 --> 25:51.692
Oh.

25:51.724 --> 25:54.158
See ya round.
Or, you know...

25:55.025 --> 25:56.059
hopefully not.

25:56.092 --> 25:58.225
But... But wait! Wait!

25:58.257 --> 25:59.958
You are a superhero!

25:59.992 --> 26:01.326
You just don't know it yet.

26:01.359 --> 26:04.291
And you will meet
your archenemy one day!

26:06.991 --> 26:09.458
Sooner than you think.

26:15.258 --> 26:17.292
Gerald?

26:17.324 --> 26:20.458
What have I told you about looking
at the neighbors sinisterly?

26:20.492 --> 26:21.625
Get inside!

26:21.657 --> 26:23.358
Sorry, Mum!

26:33.758 --> 26:35.992
Oh.

26:36.025 --> 26:38.158
"Anyone can be a hero."

26:38.191 --> 26:39.624
I wish you were right.

26:39.657 --> 26:41.625
Stop, thief!

26:47.658 --> 26:50.326
Watch out!
Here's Ibis!

26:52.624 --> 26:53.725
Masks!

26:53.758 --> 26:55.092
Bushy tails!

26:55.124 --> 26:57.624
Bandit-like behavior!

26:59.058 --> 27:01.058
The Bushy Tail Bandits!

27:01.091 --> 27:03.058
Oh, Flightless,
what should I do?

27:03.092 --> 27:05.326
"In case of a chase sequence"

27:05.359 --> 27:07.492
do nothing?

27:07.524 --> 27:09.125
"Wait for the hero
to arrive"?

27:09.157 --> 27:10.525
What?

27:10.559 --> 27:13.258
Flightless Feather,
coming through!

27:14.158 --> 27:16.992
Oh, my gumdrops!

27:17.024 --> 27:19.024
It's flightless!

27:19.058 --> 27:20.326
Hey, it's me, it's me!

27:20.358 --> 27:21.691
It's your number one fan!

27:21.724 --> 27:25.091
And your trusty sidekick,
the Gallant...

27:27.425 --> 27:30.058
All right, yeah, you...
go take the lead.

27:30.091 --> 27:31.192
You take the lead.

27:39.091 --> 27:41.491
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

27:41.525 --> 27:42.725
This can't be happening!

27:42.757 --> 27:45.391
Flightless, he's getting away!

27:45.425 --> 27:48.425
Come on, Sweetie,
it's your time to shine.

27:48.459 --> 27:49.493
Anyone can be a hero.

27:50.325 --> 27:52.159
- Hey, hey, you! You!
- What?

27:52.191 --> 27:54.992
Stop in the name
of Flightless!

27:55.024 --> 27:56.091
Hmm.

27:56.125 --> 27:57.592
Come back!

28:15.324 --> 28:17.191
Parkour!

28:17.224 --> 28:19.192
Wow. Impressive.

28:27.624 --> 28:30.359
Don't look down.
Don't look down.

28:34.391 --> 28:35.958
I looked down!

28:46.459 --> 28:48.292
You can do this, Sweetie.

28:48.325 --> 28:50.592
You can do this.
Don't look, don't look.

29:01.524 --> 29:05.291
Ha-ha! End of the line,
bandit scum.

29:05.325 --> 29:06.959
If only you could fly.

29:06.991 --> 29:08.525
Ha-ha-ha.

29:08.557 --> 29:12.124
- Oh.
- See ya, sucker!

29:12.158 --> 29:13.658
No!

29:15.558 --> 29:18.292
Come on, Sweetie.
You can still catch him!

29:18.325 --> 29:20.293
Careful, careful.

29:21.491 --> 29:23.226
Okay, okay.
Easy now.

29:25.192 --> 29:27.326
You can do this, Sweetie,
you can do this!

29:27.358 --> 29:29.925
All you've got to do
is glide.

29:32.558 --> 29:35.159
Or I could just walk.

29:35.192 --> 29:38.025
I'll just walk.
Walking's just as fast as flying.

29:38.057 --> 29:40.124
Can't skip leg day.

29:40.158 --> 29:44.392
Oh, no. Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, don't close! Don't close!

29:50.024 --> 29:53.192
It's okay, Sweetie.
Everything is gonna be okay.

29:53.224 --> 29:56.392
Just hold on tight
and don't look down.

29:56.423 --> 29:58.292
Don't...

29:59.491 --> 30:01.126
Why do I always look down?

30:14.391 --> 30:17.390
Somebody do something!

30:17.423 --> 30:19.390
We need a hero!

30:19.424 --> 30:21.491
I will save him!

30:21.523 --> 30:22.991
Duh-duh-da-da!

30:31.724 --> 30:33.025
Mmm-hmm.

30:37.457 --> 30:39.425
Yeah!

30:39.457 --> 30:41.124
<i>When I
sip on gumnut coffee,</i>

30:41.157 --> 30:44.258
<i>it gives me
my daily Cassowary Kick!</i>

30:44.291 --> 30:46.024
<i>Things are tense here, folks.</i>

30:46.057 --> 30:48.024
<i>It appears
the young sugar glider</i>

30:48.058 --> 30:51.059
<i>is unwilling or unable
to glide to safety.</i>

30:51.091 --> 30:53.390
<i>He better fly soon or he will become...</i>

30:53.423 --> 30:56.124
<i>...a "sugar faller"
instead.</i>

30:56.158 --> 30:58.158
Oh! I knew it!

30:58.192 --> 31:00.259
I knew he would get himself
into trouble.

31:02.624 --> 31:05.058
Well, what would you do
in this situation?

31:07.292 --> 31:09.224
You would...

31:09.258 --> 31:11.992
let the authorities deal with
it and not get in their way.

31:15.025 --> 31:18.091
Why do you have
to be such a good guy?

31:21.357 --> 31:24.191
Well, it looks like it's gonna rain
anyway, so I can't go out.

31:30.590 --> 31:32.357
Who even took these photos?

31:34.358 --> 31:39.026
Oh, fine, fine, I'm going, I'm going!
Mmm-hmm.

31:41.192 --> 31:43.557
I can't go out
looking like this.

31:45.558 --> 31:47.226
Unless...

31:47.992 --> 31:50.092
nobody knows it's me.

31:52.991 --> 31:55.224
Need bigger hands!

31:57.624 --> 31:59.358
Just let go and glide!

31:59.391 --> 32:00.926
You'll be okay!

32:10.057 --> 32:11.191
Hmm!

32:16.590 --> 32:18.192
Did she just crawl
out of bed?

32:18.224 --> 32:19.691
Is that a onesie?

32:29.591 --> 32:32.725
<i>And we're back, live in
downtown Sanctuary City</i>

32:32.757 --> 32:34.490
<i>where an unidentified wombat</i>

32:34.523 --> 32:37.258
<i>is attempting to save
the young sugar glider.</i>

32:42.256 --> 32:44.291
Oh, no!

32:44.323 --> 32:45.457
The plug!

33:33.157 --> 33:34.424
Woo-hoo!

33:34.457 --> 33:36.190
Sweetie, get off me!

33:36.223 --> 33:37.457
Oh, yeah.

33:38.423 --> 33:40.691
What does it feel like
to be a hero?

33:40.725 --> 33:42.224
Can we get a name?

33:47.158 --> 33:49.025
Go on. Tell them.

33:51.158 --> 33:52.158
Combat.

33:52.590 --> 33:54.126
Combat Wombat.

33:55.758 --> 33:58.124
Combat, is there
anything you want to say

33:58.158 --> 34:00.059
to the animals
of Sanctuary City?

34:01.091 --> 34:02.324
Yeah.

34:02.357 --> 34:03.692
I'm going back to bed.

34:07.623 --> 34:12.059
He can do anything,
darling. He's a chameleon.

34:12.091 --> 34:17.724
No, darling, he's a cassowary,
but he can promote anything.

34:17.757 --> 34:20.190
Who cares if your product
is for fish.

34:20.224 --> 34:23.290
We'll slap some gills on him and
you won't know the difference.

34:23.324 --> 34:26.391
Okay. Bye-bye.

34:28.524 --> 34:33.058
I don't understand, CeCe. I'm not
seeing my name in this article anywhere.

34:34.255 --> 34:36.657
Oh, you may have to
turn the page, darling.

34:36.690 --> 34:39.658
Turn the page?
What do you m...

34:41.489 --> 34:44.357
Page two?

34:44.391 --> 34:46.925
I didn't even know
newspaper's had a second page.

34:48.255 --> 34:49.357
Ugh!

34:52.456 --> 34:55.123
I stopped five robberies.

34:55.157 --> 34:57.591
All she did was
dig a little hole.

34:57.624 --> 34:59.224
I do that all the time.

34:59.256 --> 35:01.157
I dig, like,
seven holes a day to poop!

35:01.191 --> 35:04.191
You poop seven times a day?

35:04.224 --> 35:06.258
Well, I...

35:06.291 --> 35:09.024
I'm a page two superhero who's been
under a lot of stress lately.

35:09.057 --> 35:10.424
Relax, my dear.

35:10.457 --> 35:12.524
It's one measly little article.

35:12.558 --> 35:16.191
It'll be old news by tomorrow.
Nobody will even notice.

35:28.992 --> 35:31.425
Good morning!

35:31.458 --> 35:32.491
Are you all right?

35:32.524 --> 35:34.091
How'd you get in here?

35:34.123 --> 35:37.524
Well, first,
I created an alias

35:37.557 --> 35:40.657
and convinced your neighbors I
was your new roomie. Beep-boop.

35:40.690 --> 35:42.157
Then, I had to...

35:42.191 --> 35:44.025
I left the door
unlocked didn't I?

35:44.057 --> 35:45.692
- Yep.
- Damn it.

35:45.725 --> 35:48.425
Actually, it wasn't even closed.
It was wide open.

35:48.457 --> 35:51.391
Well, that doesn't mean
you can just stroll on in!

35:51.423 --> 35:52.991
Oh, sorry.

35:55.090 --> 35:57.291
Wow! Oh!

36:00.024 --> 36:02.057
Oh, I knew it!
I knew it!

36:02.090 --> 36:04.190
Oh! You are a superhero!

36:04.224 --> 36:07.625
Oh! This is a map of all
the crimes you've solved.

36:07.657 --> 36:09.024
Flightless has one
just like it.

36:09.056 --> 36:10.357
No! Just...

36:10.390 --> 36:12.025
It's nothing.

36:12.056 --> 36:14.223
You can see
the whole city from here.

36:14.257 --> 36:15.692
Ooh, ooh,
this is where I live.

36:15.725 --> 36:17.692
- Stop touching that!
- And that's where I work.

36:17.725 --> 36:20.325
Ooh, and this is where I
take air saxophone lessons.

36:20.358 --> 36:22.158
What?

36:22.191 --> 36:25.157
I knew it! I knew it,
I knew it, I knew it!

36:25.190 --> 36:29.691
And it's your archenemy.
Dun-dun-da!

36:30.991 --> 36:33.124
That's not my archenemy!

36:33.157 --> 36:35.425
Um, then why is he
dressed like that?

36:35.457 --> 36:36.958
It was Halloween!

36:36.991 --> 36:38.057
Hallo-what?

36:38.090 --> 36:39.959
What do you want, Sweetie?

36:39.991 --> 36:41.692
Oh, yes, yes!

36:41.725 --> 36:44.191
I brought you the paper.
Look.

36:44.224 --> 36:45.324
You made front page!

36:47.123 --> 36:48.990
Why are you
so grumpy today anyway?

36:49.023 --> 36:52.658
Oh, I'm a little tired
from saving somebody!

36:52.690 --> 36:56.657
Well, that's the life
we live as superheroes.

36:56.690 --> 36:58.657
Oh, do we?

36:58.690 --> 37:01.057
So tell me, Gallant Glider,

37:01.091 --> 37:04.490
any reason why you couldn't glide
yourself to safety last night?

37:04.524 --> 37:05.991
I...

37:06.024 --> 37:08.325
I needed to save my energy.

37:08.357 --> 37:12.457
Obsessed with superheroes
soaring through the sky

37:12.491 --> 37:13.692
and you can't even fly.

37:13.725 --> 37:15.491
I can so fly!

37:15.524 --> 37:18.158
Maybe in your little make-believe
world, Gallant Glider.

37:18.191 --> 37:20.091
It's not make-believe!

37:20.124 --> 37:23.224
Seriously, how come you never
learned how to glide, huh?

37:23.257 --> 37:24.991
Because!

37:25.023 --> 37:27.090
You're a sugar glider.

37:27.123 --> 37:30.524
Because I never had
anyone to teach me.

37:35.725 --> 37:37.458
I was going to learn but...

37:42.124 --> 37:43.558
<i>Come on, Sweetie.</i>

37:43.590 --> 37:45.157
<i>Oh, we love you, Sweetie.</i>

37:45.724 --> 37:47.425
But I...

37:47.458 --> 37:49.991
I never got to fill out the rest
of the pages with them.

37:55.156 --> 37:56.224
Oh.

37:59.190 --> 38:01.957
All I wanted was to put
one story in my book.

38:12.324 --> 38:13.558
Bradley.

38:16.324 --> 38:18.224
My archenemy in the picture.

38:19.056 --> 38:20.358
He's actually my husband.

38:21.290 --> 38:23.691
- Oh.
- Tunneling accident.

38:23.724 --> 38:26.257
He went missing
and I can't find him.

38:28.190 --> 38:32.957
I lost my job and the love
of my life on the same day.

38:35.256 --> 38:37.624
So, I, uh...

38:37.658 --> 38:42.225
I know you said no more drop-ins, but
I thought I'd drop-in and say thanks...

38:43.023 --> 38:44.524
for last night.

38:44.558 --> 38:46.324
Sanctuary City needs
heroes like you.

38:47.590 --> 38:49.357
Thanks.

38:49.390 --> 38:52.025
But they've already got a hero.
They don't need another.

38:53.624 --> 38:55.390
Well, maybe
it's what you need.

38:55.424 --> 38:57.257
What do you mean?

38:57.290 --> 38:59.390
Maybe it's what you need to get
back out and live your life.

38:59.424 --> 39:01.124
I live my life!

39:06.658 --> 39:08.491
Okay.
Maybe you have a point.

39:08.523 --> 39:10.424
Well, it's better than
sitting at home all day.

39:10.458 --> 39:13.158
Besides, you said
you lost your old job,

39:13.191 --> 39:17.292
so maybe being a superhero
could be your new job?

39:17.725 --> 39:19.525
Superhero?

39:19.558 --> 39:23.291
<i>Those files
are for law enforcement only.</i>

39:24.091 --> 39:27.591
I'd be law enforcement.

39:29.191 --> 39:30.458
You could be
just like Flightless!

39:30.491 --> 39:32.590
Ahh! Saving citizens.

39:32.623 --> 39:33.724
Stopping the bad guys.

39:33.757 --> 39:36.492
Or accessing files.

39:37.523 --> 39:39.957
Your file. Uh...

39:39.990 --> 39:41.291
Huh?

39:42.191 --> 39:43.358
Nothing.

39:43.391 --> 39:46.190
Tonight will go down
in history.

39:46.223 --> 39:48.390
Defender of Sanctuary City,

39:48.424 --> 39:51.558
Combat Wombat!

39:54.758 --> 39:56.391
Except,

39:56.423 --> 39:58.590
you're a little rough
around the edges.

39:58.624 --> 40:01.057
What you need is a sidekick.

40:01.090 --> 40:03.990
Yeah, you weren't gonna let that
opportunity fly past, were you?

40:04.024 --> 40:08.525
A sidekick who can teach you
how to be a true superhero.

40:10.257 --> 40:11.424
Yes!

40:11.457 --> 40:14.424
Oh! Oh! Side kick!

40:14.457 --> 40:16.991
- What was that?
- A side kick.

40:17.023 --> 40:19.657
You know, cause I'm your side...

40:19.690 --> 40:21.990
I'm already regretting this.

40:23.691 --> 40:25.991
All we need to do
is carefully follow

40:26.023 --> 40:29.357
every step in Flightless's
<i>How to Hero</i> book,

40:29.390 --> 40:31.691
and you will be
a superhero in no time.

40:31.725 --> 40:33.558
It's simple science.

40:35.223 --> 40:38.357
Step one:
create your costume.

40:46.090 --> 40:47.158
Ta-da!

40:49.024 --> 40:52.490
Ugh!

40:52.523 --> 40:55.590
Step Two:
perfect the pose.

40:55.623 --> 40:59.592
If we're gonna be heroes,
we need to pose like heroes.

41:08.324 --> 41:11.125
Step three:
get in superhero shape!

41:20.223 --> 41:21.257
Mmm.

41:23.057 --> 41:26.625
Step four: find your superpower!

41:26.657 --> 41:29.257
Cassowary Kick!

41:35.324 --> 41:36.458
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

41:37.123 --> 41:38.590
Butt Power!

41:38.623 --> 41:44.257
Step five: find your
civilian love interest.

41:44.291 --> 41:48.658
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
I already have a love interest!

41:48.690 --> 41:51.090
His name is Bradley.

42:03.223 --> 42:05.057
<i>So now that you've mastered
basics,</i>

42:05.091 --> 42:08.191
<i>it's time to move on to something
a little more interesting.</i>

42:12.423 --> 42:15.657
Come on. Harder.

42:15.689 --> 42:18.190
Faster.

42:20.658 --> 42:22.123
Butt smash!

42:22.157 --> 42:23.525
Butt stomp!

42:23.557 --> 42:25.557
Butt power!

42:37.423 --> 42:39.425
Wow!

42:39.457 --> 42:41.258
Woo-hoo!

42:41.290 --> 42:43.325
Combat Wombat!

42:47.424 --> 42:50.191
Well, I thought
this would be more exciting.

42:50.224 --> 42:53.157
And we haven't even
done anything super yet.

42:53.190 --> 42:56.057
Furbanks will
never call us superheroes.

42:56.091 --> 42:59.258
Well, all we need
is a citizen in need.

43:01.124 --> 43:04.623
I'm a citizen in need!

43:10.191 --> 43:12.290
Well, that's
extremely convenient.

43:23.024 --> 43:25.657
And three, two, one.

43:28.524 --> 43:30.124
Oh, I'm helping!

43:30.156 --> 43:31.591
I'm helping!

43:37.291 --> 43:38.558
You did it, Combat!

43:41.124 --> 43:44.557
Combat! Woo-hoo!

43:44.589 --> 43:45.724
Yeah!

43:45.756 --> 43:47.524
<i>♪ Combat Wombat, yeah ♪</i>

43:47.558 --> 43:49.224
<i>♪ Here to save the day ♪</i>

43:49.257 --> 43:50.990
<i>♪ Combat Wombat here ♪</i>

43:51.023 --> 43:52.457
<i>♪ With her
Best friend Sweetie ♪</i>

43:56.090 --> 43:57.258
Is that my...

44:00.023 --> 44:01.057
Uh-huh.

44:01.091 --> 44:03.324
It's just...

44:03.357 --> 44:05.223
so big.

44:05.257 --> 44:06.491
It's meant to be.

44:06.524 --> 44:08.458
- It's your butt!
- Hmm.

44:12.424 --> 44:14.158
Superhero montage!

44:17.623 --> 44:19.590
Air saxophone solo!

44:49.589 --> 44:50.690
Butt power!

44:58.656 --> 45:00.458
Sweetie?

45:00.490 --> 45:03.158
<i>Look out, Sanctuary City.</i>

45:03.190 --> 45:07.924
<i>Combat Wombat has resurfaced, and
she's not afraid to get her paws dirty.</i>

45:16.689 --> 45:18.157
Yippee!

45:26.390 --> 45:27.657
Bradley?

45:30.557 --> 45:32.524
Oh, my sugar drops!

45:32.557 --> 45:33.724
Look, Combat!

45:33.757 --> 45:36.524
She dressed up as you!

45:40.556 --> 45:44.357
Why, hello there,
young crime fighter.

45:44.390 --> 45:46.489
How are you today?

45:46.523 --> 45:50.657
You've inspired me to give up
my dreams of becoming a doctor

45:50.689 --> 45:52.990
to become a superhero!

45:53.024 --> 45:55.357
- Aw!
- My dad dressed up too.

45:59.056 --> 46:02.623
Aw. Very nice.

46:02.657 --> 46:04.658
We should talk, darling.

46:20.124 --> 46:22.490
Wow! Oh, wow!

46:22.523 --> 46:25.024
Sweetie, why are we even here?

46:25.056 --> 46:29.990
Well, because even Combat
Wombat needs powerful allies.

46:30.023 --> 46:31.390
Can you believe this?

46:31.422 --> 46:33.957
- Look at all this. It's so...
- Pretentious?

46:33.990 --> 46:35.691
Yes!

46:35.724 --> 46:37.291
Preten...

46:37.323 --> 46:39.723
nentionous.

46:41.357 --> 46:44.290
Oh, my Flightless!
Oh, my Flightless!

46:44.323 --> 46:45.990
Oh, what now?

46:46.024 --> 46:50.058
It's
the Sanctuary City Peace Idol!

46:50.090 --> 46:51.991
The symbol of unity
in our city.

46:52.023 --> 46:54.157
This was awarded
to CeCe and Flightless

46:54.190 --> 46:56.957
as a symbol
of eternal gratitude.

46:56.991 --> 46:59.358
Only the greatest
superheroes get one of these.

46:59.390 --> 47:03.024
You, my dear, are no superhero.

47:03.056 --> 47:06.023
You're a superstar!

47:06.056 --> 47:08.724
And what should
all superstars have?

47:08.756 --> 47:11.690
A mansion made out
of strawberry ice cream?

47:11.724 --> 47:14.358
Um, before that, darling.

47:15.323 --> 47:16.656
Um...

47:16.690 --> 47:19.157
A sponsorship deal!

47:19.589 --> 47:21.224
Oh.

47:21.257 --> 47:23.489
CeCe, what's this all about?

47:23.522 --> 47:26.158
It's about you taking
this opportunity

47:26.190 --> 47:29.723
and squeezing it
for all it's worth!

47:29.757 --> 47:31.590
Starting with...

47:32.224 --> 47:34.424
Bush Bars!

47:34.457 --> 47:35.691
Wow.

47:35.724 --> 47:38.424
Where'd they get
the pic of you smiling?

47:38.456 --> 47:42.191
Bush Bars will be the first
building block of your empire.

47:42.223 --> 47:47.489
I want your face to be
everywhere in Sanctuary City.

47:47.523 --> 47:52.457
I'm talking advertising,
sponsorships, merchandise, the works!

47:52.489 --> 47:56.389
And with the Flightless Feather
as your sidekick.

47:56.422 --> 47:58.690
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

47:58.724 --> 48:00.024
Sidekick?

48:00.057 --> 48:02.258
She's already got a sidekick...

48:02.290 --> 48:04.057
The Gallant Glider.

48:04.091 --> 48:08.090
That name means nothing to me.
Who is that?

48:08.123 --> 48:10.058
Me!

48:10.090 --> 48:12.291
Well, I guess
that could work too.

48:12.323 --> 48:14.723
Look, the point is,
Flightless is out, darling.

48:14.757 --> 48:17.624
You're the next big thing!

48:18.456 --> 48:21.157
However, I will need you to...

48:21.190 --> 48:23.323
how to say this...

48:23.357 --> 48:26.023
cut back on
the hero side of the job

48:26.056 --> 48:28.058
in order
to attend photo shoots,

48:28.090 --> 48:30.591
product promotions,
that sort of thing.

48:31.490 --> 48:34.290
So, what do you say, darling?

48:34.322 --> 48:36.290
<i>You know
what else is a treat?</i>

48:36.322 --> 48:39.489
<i>Featherade's
new savior flavor.</i>

48:39.522 --> 48:41.090
<i>When I sip
on gumnut coffee,</i>

48:41.124 --> 48:43.524
<i>it gives me
my daily Cassowary Kick!</i>

48:50.689 --> 48:53.023
To be honest, CeCe,

48:53.056 --> 48:55.356
I'm not really
interested in the whole

48:55.390 --> 48:57.324
business of being
a superhero.

48:57.357 --> 48:59.490
I appreciate the offer,

48:59.522 --> 49:02.556
but I have another reason
for wanting to do good.

49:04.756 --> 49:08.624
Do you know what this
sponsorship even means, darling?

49:09.690 --> 49:14.389
Free Bush Bars for life!

49:14.422 --> 49:15.657
What?

49:16.991 --> 49:18.324
For life?

49:18.356 --> 49:23.290
Any flavor you want,
it's yours.

49:23.322 --> 49:28.589
And for your sidekick,
Mr. Gallant Glider,

49:28.622 --> 49:30.289
well, who knows?

49:30.323 --> 49:33.490
We might even have
a costume for him.

49:33.522 --> 49:35.557
A costume? Oh!

49:37.723 --> 49:44.223
I'm afraid my answer is still no.
I wanna do this for the right reasons.

49:45.623 --> 49:51.190
How could I be angry
when you're so honest with me?

49:52.124 --> 49:53.589
And to be honest myself,

49:53.622 --> 49:56.623
I actually wish Flightless
was more like you.

49:56.657 --> 49:59.457
Oh, the ego on
that cassowary.

49:59.489 --> 50:03.157
You're a real superhero,
Combat.

50:03.657 --> 50:05.658
Don't ever change.

50:15.023 --> 50:17.123
<i>Breaking news this morning.</i>

50:17.157 --> 50:19.158
<i>Are the Bushy Tail Bandits
back in action?</i>

50:23.222 --> 50:25.324
It has to be them!

50:25.356 --> 50:28.656
The Pawlice found the group's calling
card at each of the locations.

50:28.690 --> 50:34.190
So Flightless wasn't around
to stop any of the robberies.

50:34.222 --> 50:38.423
As much as I hate the guy, he'd done
a good job of stopping them so far.

50:41.057 --> 50:42.524
Uh...

50:42.557 --> 50:44.156
Oh, oh, oh!

50:44.189 --> 50:46.490
Oh, my God. Oh.

50:50.091 --> 50:51.125
Ooh!

50:57.357 --> 51:00.058
- It's for you.
- Ugh!

51:00.090 --> 51:01.257
What's it say?

51:07.356 --> 51:10.556
"Welcome to the world
of crime fighting,

51:10.590 --> 51:12.590
Combat Wombat and friend."

51:12.623 --> 51:14.423
It says friend!

51:16.289 --> 51:19.290
- Keep reading.
- Ahh.

51:19.322 --> 51:21.222
If you've been
watching the news,

51:21.255 --> 51:23.958
you'll know we've been
quite busy of late.

51:24.589 --> 51:26.256
Since you're new to the game,

51:26.290 --> 51:28.657
we thought we'd give
you a fighting chance.

51:28.690 --> 51:32.624
Let's see if you really
are koala-fied for the job.

51:32.657 --> 51:36.189
Koala.
Oh.

51:36.222 --> 51:40.423
Our next target
is the Koalaty PR Agency.

51:40.457 --> 51:42.723
We're looking
to book in a powwow

51:42.756 --> 51:45.289
with your little friend, CeCe.

51:45.323 --> 51:50.291
Regards, your new sworn
enemies, the Bushy Tail Bandits!

51:55.322 --> 51:57.324
This is our moment, Sweetie!

51:57.357 --> 51:59.657
If we can take down
the Bushy Tail Bandits,

51:59.690 --> 52:03.157
Furbank will have to
officially make us superheroes.

52:03.189 --> 52:06.424
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

52:06.456 --> 52:09.058
Now from the note,
it looks like the bandits

52:09.089 --> 52:13.524
are planning to steal the Sanctuary
City Peace Idol from CeCe's office.

52:13.556 --> 52:17.389
Remember the time they said "Combat
Wombat and friend" in the note?

52:17.422 --> 52:18.924
Good times.

52:19.356 --> 52:20.457
Ready?

52:21.190 --> 52:22.290
Ready!

52:23.456 --> 52:25.256
Ready!

52:25.289 --> 52:26.556
Frogman?

52:26.590 --> 52:28.257
What are you doing here?

52:28.289 --> 52:30.190
Shoo, shoo, go on,
get outta here!

52:30.222 --> 52:33.623
We're gonna burrow inside
for a surprise attack,

52:33.656 --> 52:36.356
give them no chance
to escape this time.

52:36.390 --> 52:38.223
Wait. Wait.

52:38.256 --> 52:40.324
We are going to burrow?

52:44.589 --> 52:48.156
<i>Our office hours are
9:00 till 5:00, Monday through Friday.</i>

52:48.190 --> 52:49.223
<i>Please call back...</i>

52:53.522 --> 52:54.590
Ow!

52:54.622 --> 52:55.991
My bum!

52:56.022 --> 52:57.423
Shh!

53:04.357 --> 53:06.424
Maggie.
Hey, Maggie.

53:06.456 --> 53:08.623
- Psst! Maggie. Maggie.
- What?

53:08.657 --> 53:11.524
Let's go back-to-back.
It'll look so cool!

53:11.556 --> 53:13.623
Back to... What? Why?

53:13.656 --> 53:15.589
All superheroes do it.

53:15.623 --> 53:18.491
Wha... We are not doing...

53:20.422 --> 53:22.189
Back-to-back.

53:24.190 --> 53:25.290
Here he comes.

53:25.323 --> 53:26.991
The Gallant Glider.

53:30.122 --> 53:32.090
You like sugar drops?

53:32.122 --> 53:34.523
How about a Glider-rang?
Zoom!

53:37.356 --> 53:38.957
The Peace Idol.

53:58.089 --> 53:59.690
- A Bush Bar?
- Huh?

53:59.724 --> 54:01.956
What's going on Combat?

54:01.989 --> 54:04.656
Sweetie?
I think we've been set up.

54:04.690 --> 54:06.691
But why?

54:06.724 --> 54:08.291
Who would do that?

54:15.155 --> 54:16.524
Flightless!

54:16.556 --> 54:19.590
Hey! What are you
doing in here?

54:19.622 --> 54:22.357
Um, I, uh...

54:22.389 --> 54:24.389
left my glasses
here somewhere.

54:24.422 --> 54:27.122
Oh, no!

54:27.156 --> 54:28.956
Can't see without
my glasses.

54:28.989 --> 54:30.222
Hmm, but...

54:30.256 --> 54:33.090
you were just
wearing glasses.

54:33.123 --> 54:34.658
They were on your face!

54:37.557 --> 54:40.157
Hey! Where's the Peace Idol?

54:40.190 --> 54:44.090
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
This is all a big mistake.

54:44.123 --> 54:45.324
No need to panic.

54:51.023 --> 54:52.424
Sweetie!
We've gotta go!

54:55.690 --> 54:57.222
Shots fired!

54:57.256 --> 54:58.457
Send me backup!

55:00.123 --> 55:02.124
I can't find
my glasses, Maggie!

55:10.022 --> 55:12.256
- Come on, Sweetie!
- Oh, found them!

55:12.290 --> 55:14.123
Found my glasses.

55:14.156 --> 55:16.524
Let me just adjust them and...

55:16.556 --> 55:19.589
Uh, Maggie, the exit
is on the other side.

55:19.622 --> 55:21.456
Just trust me!

55:29.056 --> 55:31.691
Yippee!

55:31.724 --> 55:34.357
Oh, Gallant Glider,
teach me how to fly!

55:40.023 --> 55:42.657
Combat Wombat, did you
just rob that building?

55:42.690 --> 55:45.022
What do you have
to say for yourself?

55:45.056 --> 55:50.557
Uh, Combat. We might have a
little, tiny bit of a big problem.

55:50.589 --> 55:52.256
Yeah, you think?

56:06.390 --> 56:10.657
How could I have been so stupid?
How did I fall for that?

56:10.689 --> 56:14.623
I knew Flightless Feather was
hiding something. It was always him.

56:14.656 --> 56:18.690
<i>Little one, can you tell me your
thoughts on your "hero," Combat Wombat?</i>

56:18.724 --> 56:22.524
<i>Combat Wombat taught me that
if you believe in yourself,</i>

56:22.557 --> 56:24.290
<i>you can do anything.</i>

56:24.323 --> 56:28.357
<i>I guess that anything
includes robbing people.</i>

56:28.390 --> 56:30.656
<i>You let me down, Combat!</i>

56:33.055 --> 56:35.456
<i>Flightless, have you got
anything to say to Combat Wombat?</i>

56:35.490 --> 56:37.390
<i>Yeah.</i>

56:37.423 --> 56:41.190
<i>You just robbed your
life of freedom, punk.</i>

56:41.223 --> 56:43.123
<i>There you have it, folks.</i>

56:43.156 --> 56:45.623
<i>Combat Wombat
isn't a superhero.</i>

56:45.656 --> 56:47.323
<i>She's a thief.</i>

56:47.357 --> 56:50.491
<i>I'm Regina Rogers,
Sanctuary City News.</i>

56:51.322 --> 56:52.657
You want me to be a thief?

56:53.256 --> 56:54.491
I'll be a thief.

57:29.389 --> 57:31.222
How you...
How you holdin' up?

57:31.256 --> 57:32.724
Sweetie! What...

57:32.756 --> 57:34.457
What are you doing here?

57:34.489 --> 57:36.389
I was worried about you.

57:36.422 --> 57:39.056
They're saying some terrible
things about you on TV.

57:40.090 --> 57:41.524
- Wait, what's that?
- Nothing!

57:41.556 --> 57:43.424
It's none of your business.

57:43.456 --> 57:46.057
<i>Another break-in has
taken place this morning,</i>

57:46.089 --> 57:48.589
<i>this time in
the most unlikely of places:</i>

57:48.622 --> 57:50.289
<i>The Sanctuary City
Pawlice Station.</i>

57:50.323 --> 57:51.356
Huh?

57:51.390 --> 57:53.123
That's... You...

57:53.155 --> 57:54.523
You stole that?

57:55.722 --> 57:57.123
Why?

57:58.557 --> 58:00.290
So I can find my husband.

58:00.323 --> 58:01.990
That's...

58:02.022 --> 58:04.323
That's not something
a superhero would do.

58:04.356 --> 58:06.722
- That's not something you would do.
- Grow up, Sweetie!

58:06.755 --> 58:10.056
This is the only reason I became
a superhero to begin with.

58:10.089 --> 58:13.523
So I could get the information
in this file.

58:15.722 --> 58:18.523
So you never even cared
about any of this?

58:18.557 --> 58:21.223
Why would I?
Look where it's got me.

58:21.255 --> 58:23.957
Or should I say,
look where you've got me.

58:23.990 --> 58:25.324
What does that mean?

58:25.356 --> 58:27.423
None of this
would have happened

58:27.456 --> 58:30.490
if you didn't get me involved in all
of this superhero mess to begin with!

58:32.090 --> 58:33.457
You think this is my fault?

58:34.222 --> 58:36.023
Well, you tell me.

58:36.056 --> 58:38.657
I was doing just fine
when I was by myself.

58:38.688 --> 58:40.557
The way it should be.

58:43.056 --> 58:46.591
You know, you may not want other
animals in your life, but...

58:49.323 --> 58:50.524
some animals...

58:52.290 --> 58:53.624
they need you in theirs.

59:54.289 --> 59:57.089
I really wish
you were here right now.

01:00:03.055 --> 01:00:06.391
Do you really have to
make such a mess all the time?

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:12.089
You mean of the living room
or just my life in general?

01:00:13.622 --> 01:00:14.990
Both.

01:00:16.222 --> 01:00:17.490
He's a good kid.

01:00:19.222 --> 01:00:21.257
I know.

01:00:21.289 --> 01:00:24.357
You're gonna have to do that thing
you hate doing more than cleaning now.

01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:26.090
Apologize?

01:00:26.588 --> 01:00:28.290
Mm-hmm.

01:00:28.322 --> 01:00:30.389
But don't beat yourself
up about the floor.

01:00:30.423 --> 01:00:33.090
Sometimes you need to
make a mess of things

01:00:33.123 --> 01:00:35.291
before you can make
sense of things.

01:00:36.588 --> 01:00:38.124
What does that mean?

01:00:44.756 --> 01:00:46.157
What?

01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:49.491
Mm-hmm.

01:00:57.456 --> 01:00:59.957
<i>We have a witness
at Sanctuary Plaza,</i>

01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:03.723
<i>where it seems the town's
beloved superhero, Combat Wombat,</i>

01:01:03.755 --> 01:01:06.722
<i>has not been so super.</i>

01:01:06.756 --> 01:01:11.056
<i>Excuse me, sir.
Sir, can you tell me what you saw?</i>

01:01:11.089 --> 01:01:13.456
<i>Well, we all came out
when we heard the alarm,</i>

01:01:13.489 --> 01:01:17.356
<i>and that's when Combat literally
flew out of the building.</i>

01:01:17.389 --> 01:01:20.356
<i>She thought she'd gotten
away with it, but she...</i>

01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:23.256
- Huh?
- <i>Hey, do I get paid for this interview?</i>

01:01:35.555 --> 01:01:36.589
Huh.

01:02:00.655 --> 01:02:04.089
It's the same guy every time!

01:02:13.555 --> 01:02:14.690
Bingo!

01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:21.157
Sweetie?

01:02:26.489 --> 01:02:29.656
Uh, do you need a hand?

01:02:29.689 --> 01:02:31.522
Don't worry about it!

01:02:31.555 --> 01:02:35.622
I know "helping others"
isn't really your thing now.

01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:39.456
Sweetie...

01:02:40.756 --> 01:02:43.223
I'm sorry for
what I said earlier.

01:02:43.256 --> 01:02:44.989
I was way out of line.

01:02:48.189 --> 01:02:50.656
You said that I don't want
other animals in my life,

01:02:51.389 --> 01:02:52.390
but I do.

01:02:53.023 --> 01:02:54.990
I just...

01:02:55.023 --> 01:02:57.924
I can't afford to lose
anyone else that I love.

01:03:01.722 --> 01:03:04.291
Hopefully we can...

01:03:05.722 --> 01:03:10.157
save the day
one more time together.

01:03:25.622 --> 01:03:28.190
Every superhero
needs a costume.

01:03:30.389 --> 01:03:33.057
I didn't have much material
left, so it's, you know...

01:03:39.389 --> 01:03:40.957
Thank you.

01:03:43.089 --> 01:03:46.122
And you were right,
we should save the day!

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:47.956
And I know just how to do it.

01:03:48.489 --> 01:03:51.057
But I need my side-kick!

01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:53.123
No way!

01:03:53.155 --> 01:03:54.989
You did a side-kick!

01:03:55.522 --> 01:03:57.723
Come on, Gallant Glider.

01:03:57.755 --> 01:03:59.722
Let's go get this guy!

01:04:01.022 --> 01:04:04.056
Please, no!

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:07.257
If you have any sense of
compassion...

01:04:09.322 --> 01:04:13.589
If you have any sense of
mercy, you'll let us go.

01:04:13.621 --> 01:04:17.323
I am a loving brother,
a son, an uncle.

01:04:18.123 --> 01:04:19.257
No, wait.

01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:21.123
Wait. That's not right.

01:04:21.156 --> 01:04:24.291
That doesn't hold
enough gravitas.

01:04:26.090 --> 01:04:28.623
I have a family!

01:04:28.655 --> 01:04:32.323
And I cannot bear the thought
of never seeing little...

01:04:33.989 --> 01:04:36.488
What's a cute name...
something lispy.

01:04:36.522 --> 01:04:39.523
Uh, Erica, Lily, Lilith.

01:04:39.556 --> 01:04:40.723
Lilith!

01:04:40.756 --> 01:04:42.522
That's perfect.

01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:50.623
I cannot bear the thought of never
seeing little Lilith's face ever again.

01:04:52.689 --> 01:04:54.556
And scene.

01:05:03.056 --> 01:05:04.623
I'm the Gallant Glider.

01:05:06.055 --> 01:05:09.422
Boo!

01:05:11.255 --> 01:05:14.488
Why are you doing this to me?

01:05:14.521 --> 01:05:16.156
You set me up.

01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:18.323
What are you talking about?

01:05:18.355 --> 01:05:20.455
I didn't set up nobody.

01:05:20.489 --> 01:05:24.656
I got a note saying CeCe's
office was being robbed!

01:05:24.688 --> 01:05:26.455
You were behind it.

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:30.156
I promise!
I never set up nobody!

01:05:30.189 --> 01:05:34.223
I'm just an actor!

01:05:35.456 --> 01:05:37.590
What?
What did you just say?

01:05:38.522 --> 01:05:41.656
I don't know nothin'
about no setup.

01:05:41.689 --> 01:05:47.389
Now would you please, please just remove
your butt from my very delicate spine?

01:05:47.421 --> 01:05:50.255
Hmm.

01:05:51.621 --> 01:05:54.522
My name is Perry Poslowski.

01:05:55.355 --> 01:05:57.189
I'm part of a group of actors

01:05:57.223 --> 01:06:01.190
hired to make Flightless
look like a real superhero.

01:06:01.223 --> 01:06:04.356
Uh, we all play different
roles in his heroic acts.

01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:08.190
So it's all just...

01:06:08.223 --> 01:06:09.556
make-believe?

01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:13.356
Wait, he's not
really a superhero?

01:06:13.389 --> 01:06:15.389
Nah, it's all fake, lady.

01:06:15.422 --> 01:06:17.956
But it's great dramatic
training for us actors.

01:06:19.322 --> 01:06:21.655
Oh, Flightless,
please help me!

01:06:21.689 --> 01:06:23.990
I was just robbed!

01:06:24.022 --> 01:06:27.190
Much like I was robbed of
my youth as a young possum,

01:06:27.221 --> 01:06:31.956
growing up in a broken family
in urban Sanctuary City.

01:06:31.989 --> 01:06:33.221
Wow. Yeah.

01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:35.089
That is just really,
really good acting,

01:06:35.122 --> 01:06:37.189
but we're a bit pressed
for time here.

01:06:37.222 --> 01:06:39.090
Backstory is important.

01:06:39.123 --> 01:06:40.356
So, what about the criminals?

01:06:40.389 --> 01:06:41.723
Yeah, the Bushy Tail Bandits.

01:06:41.756 --> 01:06:45.090
You mean the Bushy Tail
Criminal Group?

01:06:45.123 --> 01:06:46.655
They're all actors.

01:06:46.688 --> 01:06:50.122
Very talented thespians,
if I do say so myself.

01:06:50.156 --> 01:06:52.323
I'm doing a show
with these fellas this week

01:06:52.356 --> 01:06:54.221
at the Sanctuary City
Community Theatre.

01:06:54.254 --> 01:06:56.256
You guys should come along.

01:06:56.288 --> 01:06:59.356
<i>Regina Rogers reporting to you
live from the Bird Borough.</i>

01:06:59.388 --> 01:07:02.690
<i>Now, we thought we'd seen the
last of the Bushy Tail Bandits,</i>

01:07:02.722 --> 01:07:06.255
<i>but they've resurfaced in
a daring daylight robbery</i>

01:07:06.289 --> 01:07:08.056
<i>of The Bank
of Shiny Things...</i>

01:07:09.288 --> 01:07:11.188
<i>That sound you're hearing</i>

01:07:11.221 --> 01:07:13.322
<i>is the crowd cheering
the arrival of Flightless,</i>

01:07:13.356 --> 01:07:17.256
<i>who will hopefully bring this
event to a speedy conclusion.</i>

01:07:20.055 --> 01:07:22.288
Hey, wait!
You wanna take a few flyers,

01:07:22.322 --> 01:07:24.957
pass 'em out to ya friends
for the show this week?

01:07:27.388 --> 01:07:29.322
We need the numbers.

01:07:31.389 --> 01:07:32.957
All right,
beaks on the floor!

01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:34.556
Don't play anything smart on me!

01:07:34.589 --> 01:07:36.989
I'm very smart!
I'm smarter than all of you!

01:07:37.022 --> 01:07:39.355
Beaks on the floor!
Nests out!

01:07:39.388 --> 01:07:42.989
No, I don't think so.
Beaks off the floor, I say.

01:07:49.456 --> 01:07:52.189
Oh, you're going down,
Flightless!

01:07:52.221 --> 01:07:54.323
That's right.
I am going down.

01:07:54.355 --> 01:07:56.556
Downtown with you
in handcuffs.

01:07:56.589 --> 01:07:58.322
Let's fight!

01:08:03.288 --> 01:08:05.589
Cassowary Kick!

01:08:09.521 --> 01:08:12.455
I have been defeated!

01:08:12.489 --> 01:08:14.723
He killed the panda!

01:08:33.154 --> 01:08:34.188
You...

01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:36.421
Me? You!

01:08:36.456 --> 01:08:38.089
No, you.

01:08:38.121 --> 01:08:40.087
I'm taking you in!

01:08:40.122 --> 01:08:43.589
No, no, no, no, no, I'm taking them
in, and then I'm taking you in.

01:08:43.621 --> 01:08:45.287
Let's fight!

01:08:45.322 --> 01:08:46.657
Cassowary Kick!

01:08:54.988 --> 01:08:59.287
Not so convincing when you
have to fight a real hero, huh?

01:08:59.322 --> 01:09:02.189
Oh, you're not a real hero!
You're a criminal!

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:03.455
You're a criminal!

01:09:03.488 --> 01:09:06.256
- You set me up!
- I set you up?

01:09:06.287 --> 01:09:08.121
I never set you up.

01:09:08.154 --> 01:09:11.022
Hey, mate.
Was there an update to the script?

01:09:11.055 --> 01:09:12.122
I don't know!

01:09:12.154 --> 01:09:13.990
I am completely lost!

01:09:14.022 --> 01:09:16.322
Oh, sure,
just like you never set up

01:09:16.354 --> 01:09:18.087
all of the crime
you've thwarted.

01:09:18.121 --> 01:09:20.389
What are you talking about?

01:09:20.421 --> 01:09:22.189
I never set up anything.

01:09:22.221 --> 01:09:25.323
Now for the love of Flightless,
if you don't let me go,

01:09:25.354 --> 01:09:27.654
the Bushy Tail Bandits
are gonna get away.

01:09:27.688 --> 01:09:32.087
Nobody is getting away
because none of this is real!

01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:34.990
What? What are you
talking about?

01:09:35.022 --> 01:09:37.256
What? Can't you see?

01:09:37.288 --> 01:09:39.156
They're not real criminals.

01:09:39.188 --> 01:09:40.956
They're just actors.

01:09:43.154 --> 01:09:44.388
What do you mean?

01:09:44.421 --> 01:09:46.654
It's all fake, Flightless.

01:09:46.689 --> 01:09:50.721
No, that can't be.

01:09:50.756 --> 01:09:53.156
So, this is all
just make-believe?

01:09:53.188 --> 01:09:56.055
You really didn't know?

01:10:00.756 --> 01:10:03.022
Wait a minute...

01:10:03.054 --> 01:10:08.588
Flightless, if you didn't know about
any of this, then that means...

01:10:08.622 --> 01:10:12.356
You just couldn't
leave well enough alone,

01:10:12.388 --> 01:10:15.221
could you, darling?

01:10:15.255 --> 01:10:17.022
Wow.

01:10:17.055 --> 01:10:18.988
It's really dark
over in that corner.

01:10:19.022 --> 01:10:20.555
Out!

01:10:20.589 --> 01:10:22.489
All of you!

01:10:30.588 --> 01:10:32.021
CeCe,

01:10:32.055 --> 01:10:33.523
why did you set me up?

01:10:33.555 --> 01:10:37.022
You were constantly
taking the spotlight

01:10:37.054 --> 01:10:42.488
away from Flightless,
ruining my business in the process!

01:10:42.522 --> 01:10:48.522
Do you know how many sponsors dropped
out after you came on the scene?

01:10:49.622 --> 01:10:52.121
You know, it didn't have
to be this way, Combat.

01:10:52.155 --> 01:10:54.556
We could have made a lot
of money together.

01:10:54.588 --> 01:11:00.188
But, no, you just wanted to be
a hero for the right reasons.

01:11:00.222 --> 01:11:03.189
Uh, so did I.

01:11:03.221 --> 01:11:06.288
Ugh, you got what you wanted.

01:11:06.321 --> 01:11:09.488
I fake a few crimes,
you get to stroke your ego,

01:11:09.522 --> 01:11:13.355
and sponsorship deals
keeping rolling in.

01:11:13.389 --> 01:11:15.956
I may be vain,
but I actually thought

01:11:15.989 --> 01:11:18.056
that I was doing some good
in the world.

01:11:18.089 --> 01:11:21.088
But you were, darling.

01:11:21.122 --> 01:11:23.690
You're a celebrity!

01:11:23.723 --> 01:11:27.989
You gave everyday nobodies
something to look up to.

01:11:29.556 --> 01:11:32.022
Now, you're going
to do your job

01:11:32.054 --> 01:11:34.389
like the good little
superhero boy that you are

01:11:34.422 --> 01:11:38.590
and convince everyone that
you've saved the day once again.

01:11:49.155 --> 01:11:51.423
Mr. Flightless.
Mr. Flightless.

01:11:53.589 --> 01:11:55.490
I was a nobody once.

01:11:56.689 --> 01:11:59.422
But you made me feel
like a somebody.

01:12:03.289 --> 01:12:04.956
You want a hero, CeCe?

01:12:05.622 --> 01:12:06.657
You've got it.

01:12:07.688 --> 01:12:10.055
Cassowary Kick!

01:12:12.455 --> 01:12:13.489
Hmm.

01:12:15.255 --> 01:12:16.555
Flightless!

01:12:16.589 --> 01:12:19.323
Well, well.

01:12:19.355 --> 01:12:23.456
Who knew you
could actually fly?

01:12:23.489 --> 01:12:28.289
You would be
nothing without me!

01:12:28.322 --> 01:12:34.121
I even collapsed an entire
stadium so you could be the hero.

01:12:34.155 --> 01:12:37.956
- Where is my thanks?
- You?

01:12:44.621 --> 01:12:47.255
You killed my husband!

01:12:49.321 --> 01:12:51.723
Oh, it's not personal darling.

01:12:51.755 --> 01:12:54.088
It's strictly business.

01:12:54.655 --> 01:12:56.989
You're a monster!

01:13:03.622 --> 01:13:06.255
You know, it's funny.

01:13:06.289 --> 01:13:10.590
I've made a fortune representing
those who wear masks.

01:13:13.322 --> 01:13:16.490
But I suppose I've been
wearing one myself all along.

01:13:18.154 --> 01:13:21.389
But now that
you've ruined that,

01:13:21.422 --> 01:13:26.657
I guess it's time to
start being myself again!

01:13:28.356 --> 01:13:29.956
CeCe's a Drop Bear!

01:13:32.656 --> 01:13:35.656
Combat, what's the plan?

01:13:35.689 --> 01:13:38.222
Run.
Definitely run!

01:13:40.456 --> 01:13:42.223
Flightless!

01:13:42.621 --> 01:13:44.122
I'm a fraud.

01:13:44.154 --> 01:13:46.155
I don't even know
how to tie my own shoes.

01:13:46.188 --> 01:13:47.722
Flightless!

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:49.156
Run!

01:13:54.322 --> 01:13:55.956
Come on,
Mr. Flightless.

01:14:13.422 --> 01:14:15.523
Run!

01:14:15.555 --> 01:14:17.655
Okay, give me a rundown.

01:14:17.688 --> 01:14:20.622
Chief, I need you to
get Sweetie to safety.

01:14:20.656 --> 01:14:22.289
It's too dangerous here.

01:14:22.321 --> 01:14:24.422
No! No way, no way!
I'm not leaving you!

01:14:24.456 --> 01:14:25.956
I can't risk you getting hurt.

01:14:25.989 --> 01:14:27.588
I'll lead her away
from everyone.

01:14:27.622 --> 01:14:29.988
Flightless, follow me.

01:14:30.022 --> 01:14:32.189
Time to be a real hero.

01:14:44.556 --> 01:14:46.956
Come on!
We're almost there.

01:14:59.689 --> 01:15:01.689
Okay, what's the plan?
The plan, what is it?

01:15:01.722 --> 01:15:03.989
Have we got one?
You've got a plan haven't you?

01:15:04.021 --> 01:15:06.089
I haven't, so if you've got a
plan, a plan would be great.

01:15:06.121 --> 01:15:07.155
Bring it out now.

01:15:13.122 --> 01:15:14.456
All right,
listen up, Flightless.

01:15:14.488 --> 01:15:17.055
When I say so,
get ready to move.

01:15:23.089 --> 01:15:24.123
Almost there.

01:15:29.989 --> 01:15:31.155
Yes!

01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:33.956
End of the line,
bandit scum!

01:15:35.588 --> 01:15:37.656
That was
a really bad idea.

01:15:37.687 --> 01:15:39.355
Sweetie, get out of here!

01:16:05.155 --> 01:16:06.523
We're running out of time!

01:16:24.588 --> 01:16:26.022
Sweetie.

01:16:26.054 --> 01:16:28.422
You're going
to have to let go!

01:16:28.455 --> 01:16:30.356
Wait, what?
Let go?

01:16:30.389 --> 01:16:32.289
Oh, I can't do this, Maggie.

01:16:32.321 --> 01:16:35.322
You know what you need
to do, Flightless Feather.

01:16:41.289 --> 01:16:42.689
You can do this!

01:16:42.721 --> 01:16:44.423
I believe in you!

01:16:44.455 --> 01:16:48.955
No! No, no, no, no, no!
Wait! Wait, wait!

01:16:48.989 --> 01:16:51.456
- Cassowary Kick!
- Butt Power!

01:16:54.088 --> 01:16:56.055
Sweetie, jump!

01:17:19.687 --> 01:17:22.621
Oh, I did it!
I actually did it!

01:17:23.221 --> 01:17:25.088
I'm flying!

01:17:25.489 --> 01:17:28.355
Woo-hoo!

01:17:32.588 --> 01:17:34.089
Wing-suit engaged.

01:17:35.288 --> 01:17:38.088
Yes, yes!
Woo-hoo!

01:17:38.121 --> 01:17:40.488
Nice work,
Flightless Feather.

01:17:40.521 --> 01:17:43.121
Oh, Gallant
Glider, you are so cool.

01:17:43.155 --> 01:17:45.088
I want to be like you.

01:17:45.122 --> 01:17:46.622
Woo-hoo!

01:18:06.021 --> 01:18:07.155
What?

01:18:14.388 --> 01:18:15.521
Huh?

01:18:20.355 --> 01:18:22.055
Please don't tell me
that's a...

01:18:22.089 --> 01:18:23.490
It's a butt!

01:18:26.089 --> 01:18:27.522
It's just...

01:18:27.555 --> 01:18:29.288
so big.

01:18:29.322 --> 01:18:30.655
It's meant to be.

01:18:30.688 --> 01:18:32.123
It's your butt.

01:18:33.688 --> 01:18:35.621
Combat!

01:18:35.655 --> 01:18:38.555
We've actually forget to tick
off one last step in the book.

01:18:38.587 --> 01:18:42.088
Step 21: Epil...

01:18:42.122 --> 01:18:45.289
Epi-low... Epi-logue...

01:18:45.321 --> 01:18:46.487
Epilogue!

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:48.554
All right.
I think I can do this one.

01:18:50.587 --> 01:18:53.155
My name is Maggie Diggins.

01:18:53.188 --> 01:18:57.455
I like sleeping in,
Bush Bars, and bad TV.

01:18:57.487 --> 01:18:59.622
I also like to dress up
in a ridiculous costume

01:18:59.654 --> 01:19:01.621
and save animals
from time to time.

01:19:02.722 --> 01:19:07.255
But this mask
isn't what makes me a hero.

01:19:07.289 --> 01:19:11.423
Being a hero is about putting the
needs of others above your own.

01:19:12.588 --> 01:19:17.189
It's being brave
and overcoming your fears.

01:19:17.222 --> 01:19:21.222
It's being the very best
version of yourself.

01:19:21.254 --> 01:19:25.488
And I don't know why anyone would
want to hide that behind a mask.

01:19:28.322 --> 01:19:29.356
Huh.

01:19:40.254 --> 01:19:41.688
I love you, Bradley.

01:19:42.487 --> 01:19:43.989
Thank you.

01:19:44.021 --> 01:19:45.122
For everything.

01:19:50.154 --> 01:19:51.290
Ready?

01:19:52.121 --> 01:19:53.454
Ready.

01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:09.216
