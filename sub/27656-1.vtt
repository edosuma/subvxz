WEBVTT

00:14.615 --> 00:16.014
- Hey have you seen my wallet?

00:16.016 --> 00:17.816
- Yeah I think it's
in our bathroom.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.083
- Oh okay.

00:19.085 --> 00:21.486
- I'm sorry, I didn't
know we had company.

00:21.622 --> 00:22.754
- What?

00:22.757 --> 00:26.759
- Your friend, tank top,
or is it Mr. Tank Top.

00:26.894 --> 00:29.093
I don't know why
I'm being so formal.

00:29.095 --> 00:32.297
I'm just a little flustered,
we hadn't been introduced.

00:32.433 --> 00:35.200
- Okay, yes I bought a tank top.

00:36.370 --> 00:39.371
- I mean how long has
this been going on?

00:39.506 --> 00:41.706
- I bought it when we
went to Santa Barbara.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.842
- Wow, I guess, you
know, the beach culture

00:43.844 --> 00:45.243
can be very seductive.

00:45.378 --> 00:48.246
- Okay, do you
want me to change?

00:48.381 --> 00:50.482
- I don't know, suns
out guns out right?

00:51.452 --> 00:52.250
(sighs)

00:52.385 --> 00:53.918
Yes I would like you to change.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.587
- [Mike] Okay, alright good.
- Two things though.

00:55.589 --> 00:58.323
Should I change our dinner
reservation to three,

00:58.459 --> 01:02.327
and are you the reason
Megan's law is in existence?

01:02.463 --> 01:03.195
- Oh my god.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.596
- Thank you.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.198
Important question though,
are you all about that

01:06.200 --> 01:07.733
he said she said bullshit?

01:09.670 --> 01:11.603
Don't drink too
much Mountain Dew.

01:11.739 --> 01:14.306
(upbeat music)

01:30.224 --> 01:32.090
- Mommy, can I have
a string cheese?

01:32.225 --> 01:33.358
I'm starving.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.027
- You're starving?

01:35.162 --> 01:38.096
Wow, I would of thought
that the seven meals

01:38.231 --> 01:41.633
that I provided with you today
would of staved that off.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.836
Oh, disaster averted.

01:45.305 --> 01:46.971
Lovey, we are going to have
to head home soon though,

01:46.973 --> 01:50.676
'cause a someone is
starting school tomorrow.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.512
- We have a kindergartner
in our family, what?

01:53.514 --> 01:54.847
How is that possible?

01:54.849 --> 01:56.915
- Grammy, can we
swim before we go?

01:57.050 --> 01:59.984
- Oh sure, come on, let's do it.

02:00.121 --> 02:03.856
- Oh, your majesty,
please allow me.

02:03.858 --> 02:05.924
Wow.

02:09.797 --> 02:10.929
- I still can't believe
she's gonna start

02:11.064 --> 02:12.064
kindergarten tomorrow.

02:12.199 --> 02:15.534
- I know, she is old as fuck.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.602
Seriously though, this
is like a big deal,

02:17.738 --> 02:19.804
this is like real school now.

02:19.940 --> 02:23.075
- She's gonna be doing
homework and book reports,

02:23.210 --> 02:24.276
and.

02:24.411 --> 02:26.945
- Uh, what's going
on over there?

02:27.080 --> 02:29.214
Someone's enjoying their day.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.750
- Oh, they are
enjoying their day.

02:31.752 --> 02:35.020
- I wish we could enjoy
our day like that, right?

02:36.957 --> 02:41.927
Wait, are those women a couple,
or are those prostitutes?

02:42.830 --> 02:44.563
- They are not prostitutes.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.565
- Uh, those are prostitutes.

02:46.567 --> 02:49.234
And we just witnessed an
exchange of money for goods,

02:49.370 --> 02:52.370
and very filthy services.

02:52.372 --> 02:54.172
I'm not gonna lie, I'm
feeling a little bit

02:54.174 --> 02:55.507
of a rush right now.

02:55.642 --> 02:58.310
I've just never seen that
transaction in nature.

02:58.445 --> 03:00.044
- They were just going
at it right there.

03:00.181 --> 03:01.980
- They got to
display their wares,

03:01.982 --> 03:06.518
they gotta move the product,
and that product is ass.

03:06.653 --> 03:08.320
- Honey do you have
Emilia's towel?

03:08.322 --> 03:09.488
- Yeah, it's right here.

03:11.058 --> 03:11.856
Mom, your nipple's out.

03:11.992 --> 03:13.658
- Oh, sorry.

03:13.660 --> 03:14.793
Must of shifted in the pool.

03:14.928 --> 03:18.330
- Don't apologize to me,
apologize to my husband.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.664
Look at his face.
- It's fine.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.199
- He can't even look at you.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.801
- [Grandma] Really,
I'm sorry Mike.

03:22.803 --> 03:26.004
- Be honest, do you see
a family resemblance

03:26.139 --> 03:28.273
in the nipples, because
I've always thought

03:28.275 --> 03:29.942
I took after my
father in that way.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.410
- I'm not answering that.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.812
- Mike, it's just a
nipple, everyone has them.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.680
Even you.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.216
- Alright Sharon please
don't mention my nipples now.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.217
- I'm gonna mention
your nipples.

03:39.352 --> 03:40.685
- Please don't.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.754
- Wow, I actually have a podcast
called Mike's Nipples so.

03:42.757 --> 03:44.690
I'd love to have
you guest one time.

03:46.493 --> 03:50.829
I just feel like if my nipple
was out in the open air,

03:50.964 --> 03:52.631
I would feel it, I would know.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.767
- Yeah, but hers are older,
I mean maybe they're not

03:54.902 --> 03:56.168
as sensitive.

03:56.303 --> 03:57.702
Oh, why am I talking about this.

03:57.838 --> 04:00.705
- Did you just call
my mom's nipples old.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.040
- Yeah.

04:02.042 --> 04:04.509
- Wow, she is not gonna
be happy when I have to

04:04.511 --> 04:06.378
100% tell her you said that.

04:06.513 --> 04:07.179
- No you won't.

04:07.314 --> 04:08.847
- Yes I will.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.248
- You won't tell her that
I said her nipples are old.

04:10.383 --> 04:11.784
- You know that I will though.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.118
- Stop it.

04:13.254 --> 04:14.386
What time are we setting
the alarm for tomorrow?

04:14.521 --> 04:16.789
- 6:30 A.M.

04:16.924 --> 04:20.925
Why does kindergarten
have to start so early?

04:20.927 --> 04:22.260
- I don't know.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.595
- That was one of the things
I loved about preschool

04:23.597 --> 04:25.730
is that it technically
started at nine

04:25.866 --> 04:27.065
but that was more of a
vague recommendation.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.201
- I wonder what teacher
she's gonna get.

04:29.336 --> 04:31.804
- I mean Mr. Castelottis
supposed to be great,

04:31.806 --> 04:32.871
I'm sure they're all good.

04:32.873 --> 04:33.738
- Yeah, yeah yeah.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.675
- This is like, really a thing.

04:36.677 --> 04:37.742
- Big deal.

04:37.744 --> 04:39.244
- She's gonna have so much fun.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.948
How much money do you
think I would make

04:43.950 --> 04:45.617
as a prostitute?

04:45.619 --> 04:47.019
- Oh boy, I knew it.

04:47.154 --> 04:48.553
- Of course you knew it.

04:48.689 --> 04:51.356
But seriously, like I just
want to know my market value,

04:51.358 --> 04:52.825
like for real.

04:52.827 --> 04:54.158
- I have no idea, I'm not
familiar with the average

04:54.160 --> 04:56.294
day rate of a prostitute.

04:56.430 --> 04:59.364
- I think you could guesstimate
what I might go for.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.565
I'd love a number please.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.167
- I don't want to half ass it.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.368
Why don't I go out there
and do a little research,

05:03.370 --> 05:04.969
and uh.
- Ooh.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.238
- Get back here.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.973
- Like, as in hire a
prostitute or Google something?

05:09.110 --> 05:10.108
- I'll probably just Google it.

05:10.243 --> 05:11.376
- Of course.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.512
Alright, I appreciate
your attention to detail

05:13.514 --> 05:14.713
and I look forward
to the number,

05:14.715 --> 05:17.782
however you research
it, and get back to me.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.317
- Wow.
- Yeah.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.887
- Are you looking to work
hard for the money right now?

05:24.391 --> 05:28.326
- Oh, eyebrows, not
loving that working John.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.661
- Yep, you're a mean prostitute.

05:29.664 --> 05:31.930
- You haven't let me
just play my wares.

05:32.065 --> 05:32.931
- Oh wait there's wares?

05:33.066 --> 05:34.132
I'll see a display of wares.

05:34.267 --> 05:35.400
- You'll sample the wares?

05:35.536 --> 05:36.735
- Sure.
- Alright.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.403
- I'll sample.

05:38.405 --> 05:40.605
- You will need to bring a
coupon to do that though.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.674
- What?
- Yeah.

05:42.677 --> 05:45.077
- Wait you're a
prostitute with coupons?

05:45.212 --> 05:45.944
- Yeah.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.212
- That's not good.

05:47.214 --> 05:48.080
(laughing)

05:48.082 --> 05:49.347
- How are we running late.

05:49.483 --> 05:50.482
We rose with the sun.

05:50.617 --> 05:51.917
Emilia, come on, let's go.

05:53.887 --> 05:54.653
- Mommy.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.756
- How are you not dressed?

05:57.891 --> 06:00.759
What have you been doing
for the past 30 minutes?

06:00.761 --> 06:02.827
- I didn't know if it
will be hot or cold today.

06:02.963 --> 06:05.964
- Oh my god, just
put on clothes.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.766
Go, go, go!

06:07.901 --> 06:09.768
- Can I wear my cat ears?

06:09.770 --> 06:11.236
- Yes, wear whatever you want.

06:11.372 --> 06:14.373
Just wear something,
we have to go.

06:15.710 --> 06:17.242
What the fuck.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.745
(upbeat music)

06:20.715 --> 06:23.115
Lovey, you got Mr. Castelottis.

06:23.117 --> 06:24.116
- [Mike] Oh hey,
I hear he's great.

06:24.118 --> 06:25.784
- Hey we got Mr.
Castelottis too.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.452
I'm Beth, this is
my daughter Sophie.

06:27.454 --> 06:30.455
- Hi, I'm Andrea, this is Mike,
this is our daughter Emilia.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.390
- I love your cat ears Emilia.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.726
- Do you want to play fairies?

06:33.861 --> 06:35.460
- Sure.

06:35.596 --> 06:36.461
- Oh my god.

06:36.597 --> 06:37.396
- That was quick.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.331
That was like a dream come true.

06:39.333 --> 06:42.066
- It's a really great line,
I used to use it in bars.

06:42.068 --> 06:45.137
- Do you want to play fairies,
that was your pickup line?

06:45.139 --> 06:46.004
- Killed.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.339
- Oh my god.

06:47.474 --> 06:48.540
- Mike, be honest, how
many times were you amazed

06:48.542 --> 06:49.674
before you met me?

06:49.676 --> 06:50.342
13?

06:50.477 --> 06:51.476
- We just met her, so.

06:51.612 --> 06:52.544
- Did you want to try it on?

06:52.546 --> 06:54.012
Do you need me to step away?

06:54.014 --> 06:55.547
- Oh I can act like I didn't
hear it the first time

06:55.682 --> 06:56.415
if that's.
- I think that would help you.

06:56.550 --> 06:57.549
- Hey guys.

06:57.684 --> 06:59.083
- What, hi.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.753
- How you Mike.
- This is Beth.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.955
Beth, Brian.

07:02.957 --> 07:05.223
- So Izzy got Ms. Reamus.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.492
- No, we got Mr. Castelottis.

07:07.494 --> 07:09.227
- Oh, I'm sorry, don't
hit me over there.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.829
- Well I'm very very mad.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.965
Although Ms. Reamus
looks delightful.

07:12.967 --> 07:14.699
- [Beth] I heard all
teachers are great.

07:14.701 --> 07:16.701
- They'll have recess, they'll
be able to still hang out.

07:16.837 --> 07:20.639
- Hello, good morning,
I'm Mr. Castelottis,

07:20.774 --> 07:23.409
everyone in my class, let's
line up and head inside.

07:25.646 --> 07:26.378
- Wow.

07:27.514 --> 07:29.014
- That's their
kindergarten teacher?

07:30.785 --> 07:35.220
- Good luck, he looks
like he gives great hugs.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.590
- Brian stop smiling.

07:38.592 --> 07:39.491
- It's, okay.

07:44.999 --> 07:47.332
- Yeah, her kindergarten
teacher is balding,

07:47.334 --> 07:50.202
wears a suit, has
a full mustache.

07:50.337 --> 07:52.204
This is what I left
my daughter with.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.807
- Okay, so your daughter
is being cared for

07:54.809 --> 07:56.741
by a child molester?

07:56.743 --> 07:57.742
- Yes, obviously.

07:57.744 --> 07:58.610
- Wow, great parenting.

07:58.746 --> 07:59.812
- I mean, thank you.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.346
Listen, if she's
gonna get molested,

08:01.482 --> 08:02.947
I rather it happens at
the school so at least

08:02.949 --> 08:04.416
she's getting an education
at the same time,

08:04.551 --> 08:07.419
that way you know, it's not
just only about the sex.

08:07.554 --> 08:08.821
- What, what are
you talking about?

08:08.823 --> 08:10.355
Are you okay?

08:10.357 --> 08:12.825
- I don't know, I'm so tired,
I had to wake up at 6:30.

08:12.827 --> 08:15.293
I hate kindergarten.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.495
- This is crazy.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.697
You are acting like a
lunatic, what are doing?

08:18.699 --> 08:19.898
- Kyle hold my hands.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.299
- No, no, put your
little grabbers away,

08:21.435 --> 08:22.567
I don't want them.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.436
Get them, I don't
want your touching.

08:24.571 --> 08:25.704
(keys clacking)

08:25.706 --> 08:27.105
What are you doing?

08:27.107 --> 08:28.507
- Is this better than
anything you've ever written?

08:28.642 --> 08:30.175
- I write what you write,
we write the same thing.

08:30.311 --> 08:31.776
- We don't write the
exact same thing.

08:31.778 --> 08:33.578
If we wrote the
exact same thing,

08:33.580 --> 08:36.448
then we could just take half
the time to do something.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.783
- I'll be honest, we
could take half the time

08:38.919 --> 08:40.919
to do something if you would
talk about your daughter's

08:41.054 --> 08:43.388
school less and worked more.

08:43.524 --> 08:46.058
- Fine, can we just write
the scene at graduation.

08:46.060 --> 08:50.396
- I have notes on that in here.

08:52.266 --> 08:53.932
- Listen I don't want
us off track again,

08:54.067 --> 08:57.202
but how much do you think I
would make as a prostitute?

08:57.204 --> 09:00.072
Seriously, like true question?

09:03.077 --> 09:04.943
Okay, forget it, forget it.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.010
- No no no no no.

09:06.012 --> 09:07.546
Perfectly valid question.

09:07.548 --> 09:08.947
- Okay.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.684
- I'm assuming this is some
sort of make a wish situation,

09:11.819 --> 09:13.418
you've been diagnosed
with terminal cancer,

09:13.554 --> 09:17.422
and the Make a Wish Foundation
decides to grant your wish

09:17.424 --> 09:20.625
which is to be paid
for sex, I guess.

09:20.761 --> 09:25.564
I bet they could find
somebody to pay seven dollars.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.232
- You proud of yourself?

09:27.234 --> 09:28.100
Did that feel good?

09:28.235 --> 09:29.368
Taking me down?

09:29.503 --> 09:30.835
- And then, you
have to remember,

09:30.971 --> 09:33.171
Make a Wish Foundation
is a not for profit,

09:33.306 --> 09:35.640
so the money for them
is purely symbolic.

09:35.642 --> 09:36.841
- Oh, so it's like your dick?

09:36.977 --> 09:40.312
- No sorry, no my dick
isn't symbolic at all.

09:40.314 --> 09:41.646
It's a literal dick.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.048
It fact, it's almost
too on the nose.

09:44.050 --> 09:46.251
- Is that where
you put your dick?

09:46.387 --> 09:47.386
On people's noses?

09:47.521 --> 09:48.921
- If they want me too.

09:48.923 --> 09:49.922
If someone asked me to
put my dick on their nose,

09:49.924 --> 09:50.855
I'd happily do it.

09:50.857 --> 09:52.257
I'm not judgemental.

09:52.393 --> 09:54.793
- Alright, you know what,
put it on my repertoire.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.461
One of the things I need
to know as an prostitute.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.463
People like to throw
their dick on a nose.

09:58.599 --> 09:59.598
- See, you know what?

09:59.600 --> 10:00.799
Your price just went up.

10:00.934 --> 10:01.800
- Really?

10:01.802 --> 10:04.236
- Yep, 13 dollars.

10:06.673 --> 10:07.940
- You sure this is where
they said the kindergartners

10:08.075 --> 10:09.274
would come out?

10:09.410 --> 10:10.275
- Yeah, this is where
they said, right here.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.543
- I'm a little nervous.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.946
Feel like I'm waiting
for my husband

10:14.081 --> 10:15.880
to stroll out of prison.

10:15.882 --> 10:17.482
- Okay, yeah I'm not
interested in hearing

10:17.618 --> 10:19.684
your dirty prison fantasy again.

10:19.686 --> 10:21.686
- What, it's just been 20
years since I've seen him

10:21.822 --> 10:25.958
and no man has been able to
satisfy my needs like he did.

10:25.960 --> 10:29.494
Actually warden, maybe
give me a few minutes

10:29.496 --> 10:30.963
before you give
his clothes back.

10:30.965 --> 10:32.897
I got a couple things I want to.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.899
- No don't involve me in this,

10:35.035 --> 10:38.170
and also, why would he be
walking out of prison naked?

10:38.172 --> 10:39.772
I mean he would of already
been given his clothes by now.

10:39.774 --> 10:41.306
- Oh, all of a sudden
you're just an expert

10:41.442 --> 10:43.776
in the intake and outtake
of federal penitentiaries?

10:43.778 --> 10:44.777
(school bell rings)

10:44.912 --> 10:46.111
- You cast me as though.

10:46.247 --> 10:46.979
- Oh, here they come.

10:46.981 --> 10:48.380
- Where's my girlie?

10:48.515 --> 10:51.216
- There she is,
come here lovey, hi.

10:52.987 --> 10:54.319
Bubs, what's wrong?

10:54.321 --> 10:55.587
- I want to go home.

10:57.191 --> 10:57.956
- Okay.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.259
What happened?

11:01.729 --> 11:03.728
I think I got her asleep.

11:03.730 --> 11:04.797
- Yeah?

11:04.932 --> 11:06.531
Oh man, broke my heart
to see her so upset.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.801
- I know, me too.

11:08.936 --> 11:11.804
I mean we just threw
her to the wolves today.

11:11.806 --> 11:14.339
She was acting like a cat,
of course the other kids

11:14.475 --> 11:15.874
called her a baby.

11:15.876 --> 11:18.477
I mean we know
kids can be dicks,

11:18.479 --> 11:19.678
but the fact is,

11:19.680 --> 11:23.215
Emilia's had absolutely
no dick in her life.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.817
Usually that sentence
would delight me

11:24.952 --> 11:26.485
and I can't even enjoy it.

11:26.620 --> 11:30.222
Why didn't I make her take
off those god damn cat ears.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.224
- I don't think we could
of seen this coming?

11:32.359 --> 11:35.828
- She is six and acts
like a little baby.

11:35.830 --> 11:36.829
That is on us.

11:36.964 --> 11:38.497
We treat her like a queen.

11:38.499 --> 11:42.835
We literally robe and
disrobe the child.

11:42.837 --> 11:44.036
- The way she just
holds her arms out,

11:44.171 --> 11:45.838
waiting to be tended to.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.172
- She's an animal.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.708
We just got to stop
coddling her so much.

11:49.843 --> 11:50.709
- You're right.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.577
- Parenting can lick my butt.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.179
- Right.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.048
- I will say, there's also
another more important

11:56.050 --> 11:57.449
subject we need to discuss.

11:58.719 --> 12:00.785
Where are you on my
prostitution number.

12:00.921 --> 12:01.986
- Oh, I've made some headway.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.321
- Did you actually Google it?

12:03.457 --> 12:06.258
Is that now lurking in your
computer search history?

12:06.393 --> 12:08.326
- Oh yeah, unfortunately.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.928
Alright, so I've got
some questions for you.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.063
- Yeah.

12:11.198 --> 12:12.397
- Just want to do my
due diligence here.

12:12.533 --> 12:16.068
- Finding this all
very attractive.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.335
- Okay great.

12:17.471 --> 12:18.403
So you're saying
that prostitution

12:18.405 --> 12:19.538
is your full time job now?

12:19.673 --> 12:21.874
- Yes, like you've been
in some sort of tragic,

12:21.876 --> 12:23.675
probably disfiguring accident.

12:23.678 --> 12:27.345
I'm no longer funny, this
is literally all we have

12:27.481 --> 12:28.681
as a family to survive.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.815
- Okay, alright,
I've got a number.

12:30.817 --> 12:32.150
- Great.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.151
- Alright, based on my research
I think you'd do very well.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.352
- Really?

12:34.488 --> 12:36.488
- I'm gonna say 250 dollars.

12:36.623 --> 12:40.959
- 250 dollars?

12:40.961 --> 12:43.295
Are you out of
your god damn mind?

12:43.430 --> 12:44.162
- Oh wow.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.430
- For the whole night?

12:45.566 --> 12:46.699
- Yeah why, what
were you thinking?

12:46.834 --> 12:49.568
- I was thing
10,000 dollars min.

12:49.703 --> 12:52.437
- Whoa, people don't spend
10,000 on prostitutes.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.172
How much sex money do
you think people have.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.440
- You know what, no.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.641
I don't accept
that number, okay.

12:56.643 --> 12:59.177
Because I have a
product that is superior

12:59.179 --> 13:01.045
to other products on the market.

13:01.182 --> 13:03.448
I am very good at what I do.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.517
- You are good,
but 10,000 dollars.

13:05.652 --> 13:06.919
- You know what the problem is?

13:07.054 --> 13:08.853
You are undervaluing its worth.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.188
- Your sex worth?

13:10.190 --> 13:11.390
- Yeah, you've lost
all perspective.

13:11.525 --> 13:14.326
It's like, if you were
married to a chef.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.261
You know, after a while
you stop appreciating

13:16.397 --> 13:18.997
the culinary skill and
you think, oh yeah,

13:18.999 --> 13:20.532
everyone cooks this well.

13:20.534 --> 13:22.000
- Maybe.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.401
- Because I'll tell you what,
most people in the world

13:23.403 --> 13:25.670
cook hot dogs, and
I fuck like a champ.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.005
- That is a sentence.

13:27.007 --> 13:31.543
- I wouldn't put tongue
to tip for 250 dollars,

13:31.678 --> 13:33.946
to be clear.

13:33.948 --> 13:35.314
- Another good sentence.

13:38.619 --> 13:40.352
- I go first, then Grammy.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.155
- Actually you went
first last time Bubs,

13:43.290 --> 13:45.090
now it's Grammy's
time to go first.

13:45.226 --> 13:47.292
- [Emilia] I want to go first.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.628
- Well, we all want
to go first right?

13:49.630 --> 13:51.163
But that wouldn't
be fair to Grammy.

13:51.165 --> 13:53.231
She would be very sad if
she didn't get her turn.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.233
- Honey, you go
ahead and go first.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.835
- Well then you know
what, I'm not gonna play,

13:56.837 --> 13:58.771
because the rules
say to take turns.

13:58.906 --> 14:00.572
If we're not playing
by the rules, then,

14:00.574 --> 14:02.641
I'm not interested.

14:02.643 --> 14:03.742
- Everything okay?

14:05.045 --> 14:07.045
- It's just you know,
when you play a game,

14:07.180 --> 14:09.247
you got to all take the rules in

14:09.382 --> 14:10.849
and not complain about them.

14:10.984 --> 14:12.517
That's what we do.

14:12.653 --> 14:14.118
Go ahead mom, it's your turn.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.120
- This is gonna be fun.

14:16.122 --> 14:17.922
- Oh, look at me, a double.

14:18.058 --> 14:20.592
- Oh, I just got a single.

14:20.728 --> 14:22.727
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.196
You've already picked a card.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.531
- Well, I made a new
rule, I get two cards.

14:26.667 --> 14:28.333
- We've already
agreed to the rules,

14:28.469 --> 14:29.534
it's one card.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.469
- You're not playing fair.

14:30.604 --> 14:32.537
- Actually, I am playing fair.

14:32.539 --> 14:33.405
- No you're not.

14:33.407 --> 14:35.139
- Yes I am, these are the rules.

14:35.141 --> 14:36.008
- No they're not.

14:36.010 --> 14:37.009
- Yes they are.

14:37.144 --> 14:38.610
- Well I'm not playing.

14:38.612 --> 14:41.413
- Okay, well Grammy and
I are gonna keep playing,

14:41.415 --> 14:45.484
and I am getting very
close to Licorice Lagoon.

14:45.619 --> 14:46.452
Da da da da da da.

14:47.621 --> 14:49.421
- You could of just let
her take another card.

14:49.423 --> 14:51.756
- Mom, you want me
to just let her cry

14:51.758 --> 14:52.624
and get whatever she wants?

14:52.626 --> 14:53.826
- She's six years old.

14:53.828 --> 14:54.693
- Exactly.

14:54.695 --> 14:56.028
Six is not a baby.

14:56.030 --> 14:57.496
And you know what, she
doesn't have a sibling

14:57.498 --> 14:58.831
to toughen her up.

14:58.966 --> 15:01.500
Dave used to spit in my mouth
if he caught me cheating.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.101
- Oh god.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.437
- Exactly, and that is why
I know to follow rules.

15:05.439 --> 15:07.706
She doesn't have that luxury,
so now I have to pretend

15:07.841 --> 15:09.174
to give a shit about Candyland.

15:09.310 --> 15:10.442
- Don't say shit.

15:10.444 --> 15:12.444
- Okay well, you know
what I am going to say.

15:12.579 --> 15:16.981
I just entered Candy Castle,
does that mean I win?

15:16.983 --> 15:20.318
I mean, I didn't see
this coming but I accept

15:20.454 --> 15:21.786
what's occurred.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.321
- You are a model
of sportsmanship.

15:23.457 --> 15:24.923
- Thank you.

15:24.925 --> 15:27.259
- And by the way, it says the
youngest player goes first.

15:27.261 --> 15:28.060
- It does?

15:28.195 --> 15:29.461
- Yeah.

15:29.463 --> 15:30.863
- What's it say now?

15:30.998 --> 15:35.467
I think it's just probably who
got in to Candy Castle last.

15:36.870 --> 15:39.405
Okay mom, careful
there rouge nipple.

15:40.941 --> 15:42.541
- Bubs, I'm putting your
name on your water bottle.

15:42.543 --> 15:43.676
- Okay.

15:43.811 --> 15:45.610
- Actually, yours is
the one with the smear.

15:45.746 --> 15:48.547
- Mommy, why do so
many kids in my class

15:48.549 --> 15:50.215
already know the big kids.

15:50.217 --> 15:52.417
- Well, a lot of
kids in your class

15:52.553 --> 15:54.486
have big brothers and sisters
who already go to the school.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.888
- Yeah, but as you make friends,

15:55.890 --> 15:57.289
you'll become friends
with their siblings too.

15:57.424 --> 15:59.624
- You know what, sometimes
it's actually really helpful

15:59.626 --> 16:01.226
to be friends with the big
kids 'cause they can teach

16:01.228 --> 16:02.627
you the ropes of the school.

16:02.629 --> 16:03.828
Make you feel like a big girl.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.230
- [Mike] Yeah.

16:05.366 --> 16:07.432
- But it is eight o'clock,
and you need to get to bed,

16:07.434 --> 16:09.768
so get that tushy up,
because I'm going to eat it.

16:09.903 --> 16:11.303
Get in bed.

16:11.438 --> 16:12.571
Oh, it's so cute.

16:12.706 --> 16:15.240
I mean how long do you
think it's gonna be

16:15.376 --> 16:17.309
before she makes me stop
getting up in that tushy?

16:17.444 --> 16:20.512
- I have to hope
before graduate school?

16:20.514 --> 16:22.781
- She should be so lucky.

16:22.783 --> 16:27.719
I can get to that tushy
at graduate school.

16:27.788 --> 16:30.589
ds with a
new girl, her name is Stella.

16:30.724 --> 16:33.392
- Oh, sounds like you
had a pretty good day.

16:33.527 --> 16:36.795
- We took turns
going down the slide,

16:36.930 --> 16:38.663
and I let her go first.

16:38.665 --> 16:39.331
- You did?

16:39.466 --> 16:42.401
Bubs, I am proud of you.

16:42.536 --> 16:46.138
- Did you know Stella has
a sister in fourth grade?

16:46.140 --> 16:47.272
- I did not know that.

16:47.408 --> 16:48.740
- She's really nice.

16:48.743 --> 16:50.342
- Well that's great.

16:50.344 --> 16:51.944
Remember I said
it's sometimes nice

16:52.079 --> 16:53.812
to have big kid
friends to talk to.

16:53.947 --> 16:55.948
- She says I am
gonna get pubic hair.

16:58.084 --> 17:00.519
- Oh, actually, you know what.

17:03.624 --> 17:07.759
Stella's sister is
right, because everybody

17:07.762 --> 17:10.295
at a certain age gets
hair on their privates,

17:10.297 --> 17:13.165
just like mommy, one day,
you will get pubic hair.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.833
- I don't like your pubic hair.

17:16.303 --> 17:20.505
- Wow, okay, well
regardless, either way,

17:20.507 --> 17:22.641
it's gonna happen to you.

17:23.977 --> 17:25.377
- Do boys get pubic hair?

17:25.512 --> 17:27.513
- Of course, everybody gets it.

17:28.582 --> 17:29.648
- Daddy doesn't have pubic hair,

17:29.650 --> 17:31.516
- Yeah he does.

17:31.518 --> 17:32.184
- No he doesn't.

17:32.319 --> 17:33.585
- Yeah, he does.

17:33.587 --> 17:34.787
- No he doesn't.

17:34.922 --> 17:36.588
- Yeah, he does.

17:36.724 --> 17:38.791
- No he doesn't.

17:38.926 --> 17:40.592
- I'm not gonna argue
with you about this,

17:40.728 --> 17:43.729
daddy has pubic hair, okay.

17:46.667 --> 17:48.133
- Mommy, what's a period?

17:48.269 --> 17:50.736
- How long were you talking
to Stella's sister for?

17:53.741 --> 17:55.340
Well I guess the upside
is our six year old

17:55.476 --> 17:58.010
is now prepared for her period.

17:58.145 --> 18:00.278
Downside, I am aware that
our daughter is not a fan

18:00.414 --> 18:03.081
of my pubic hair.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.349
- What?

18:04.351 --> 18:06.018
- Yeah, I am she has
no idea, first of all,

18:06.020 --> 18:08.487
how aspirational
this situation is.

18:08.489 --> 18:10.689
It is primped and preened
within an inch of it's life.

18:10.824 --> 18:12.957
- So Stella's sister
just knew all this stuff?

18:12.959 --> 18:15.293
- Yes, she's in
fourth grade okay?

18:15.295 --> 18:19.097
Our daughter's now at a school
that goes up to sixth grade,

18:19.232 --> 18:22.835
so she's gonna be exposed
to all kinds of things.

18:22.837 --> 18:25.437
- When do girls even get their
period, isn't it like 15?

18:25.572 --> 18:28.440
- No, I was eleven.

18:28.575 --> 18:29.974
- What?

18:30.111 --> 18:31.443
- I mean I was on the
early side, but you know,

18:31.445 --> 18:33.245
usually by thirteen,
everyone's walking around

18:33.247 --> 18:34.913
quietly bleeding.

18:35.048 --> 18:36.181
- Jesus.

18:36.317 --> 18:38.316
- It's really just been
pretty fantastic day,

18:38.452 --> 18:39.584
'cause you know what
you get to talk about

18:39.720 --> 18:40.985
after you finish with periods?

18:41.122 --> 18:44.056
You get to walk them
through the specific anatomy

18:44.058 --> 18:45.590
of the vagina.

18:45.592 --> 18:50.229
Yeah, the labias, minorum,
majora, the urethral opening,

18:51.331 --> 18:52.664
that was a big one.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.733
- Suddenly really appreciating
my 6 P.M. conference call.

18:54.868 --> 18:56.468
- Yeah well, don't
get too comfortable

18:56.603 --> 18:59.003
because Emilia doesn't
believe you have pubic hair,

18:59.140 --> 19:01.473
so I'm gonna need a snapshot.

19:01.475 --> 19:02.941
- You're not taking
a picture of my penis

19:03.076 --> 19:04.142
to show our daughter.

19:04.277 --> 19:07.345
- I'm not asking for
the Washington Monument,

19:07.481 --> 19:10.215
just give me the mall, alright?

19:10.217 --> 19:11.349
- Not happening.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.484
- What if I just wanted
a picture for me?

19:12.619 --> 19:13.686
- No.

19:13.821 --> 19:16.555
- I promise I won't
show it to our daughter.

19:16.557 --> 19:18.290
- I don't trust you.

19:18.292 --> 19:21.359
- Well, alright, you got
to go to sleep sometime.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.729
See you in bed.

19:28.302 --> 19:30.235
So how's Izzy liking Ms. Reamus?

19:30.371 --> 19:32.204
By the way, Emilia
knows about periods.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.439
- What?

19:34.441 --> 19:35.908
- Stella's older sister.

19:35.910 --> 19:37.576
I thought you should know so
maybe you'd be more prepared

19:37.711 --> 19:40.979
than I was, which was
not remotely prepared.

19:40.981 --> 19:42.114
- You're serious?

19:42.249 --> 19:43.382
- Well I told her not to
tell any of her friends,

19:43.517 --> 19:44.983
so hopefully she will
keep her mouth shut.

19:44.985 --> 19:47.720
But just the mommy's want
to tell them themselves.

19:47.855 --> 19:48.721
- Oh, okay.

19:48.856 --> 19:49.988
- What?

19:50.123 --> 19:50.789
- Why do you assume
it's gonna be a mommy?

19:50.924 --> 19:52.591
- Brian.

19:52.593 --> 19:53.926
- Yes.

19:54.061 --> 19:56.194
- Unless your wife, and every
other female family member

19:56.329 --> 20:00.265
and friend is dead and
buried, it should be mommies.

20:00.267 --> 20:03.135
- I'm just saying I have a
pretty strong take on all this.

20:03.270 --> 20:04.403
- Gross.

20:04.538 --> 20:06.338
- You're gross.

20:06.340 --> 20:07.672
- I can't wait to
hear how that goes.

20:07.808 --> 20:09.741
- I'll record it for you.

20:09.744 --> 20:10.609
- Will you?

20:10.611 --> 20:11.944
- Yes.

20:11.946 --> 20:13.412
- Actually, in all
honestly, I would love that.

20:13.547 --> 20:15.547
- You know, I would talk to
Emilia's teacher about this,

20:15.549 --> 20:17.282
you know what I'm saying,
just give him a heads up.

20:17.418 --> 20:18.817
- To Mr. Castelottis?

20:18.819 --> 20:22.354
- Yes, Mr. Castelottis, I mean
that is her teacher right?

20:22.356 --> 20:23.755
- Right.

20:23.758 --> 20:26.091
- If it were me, I'd be
talking to Ms. Reamus about it.

20:26.227 --> 20:29.361
- I don't enjoy you as a friend.

20:29.496 --> 20:30.695
- I love you as a friend.

20:30.831 --> 20:33.465
- I don't enjoy you
loving me as a friend.

20:35.169 --> 20:36.901
- Enjoy your convo.

20:37.037 --> 20:38.036
- Convo?

20:38.171 --> 20:38.904
- Conversation.

20:41.374 --> 20:44.709
- Hi, Mr. Castelottis,
I'm Andrea, Emilia's mom.

20:44.711 --> 20:45.844
- Ms. Lauren, yes, hello.

20:45.979 --> 20:47.912
- Oh, hi, hello.

20:47.914 --> 20:51.316
I just wanted to let
you know that yesterday,

20:51.452 --> 20:53.718
Emilia had a very
illuminating conversation

20:53.720 --> 20:55.854
with Stella's older sister.

20:55.856 --> 21:00.058
And now has learned
about periods,

21:00.060 --> 21:05.030
and pubic hair, so, um , I
just wanted to let you know

21:06.533 --> 21:09.067
in case she seems a
little off, or god forbid

21:09.069 --> 21:11.736
anything comes up, what we've
been dealing with at home.

21:11.872 --> 21:13.005
- Well I appreciate
you telling me.

21:13.007 --> 21:14.739
I'll you know if
anything comes up.

21:14.875 --> 21:16.208
- Thank you, I really
appreciate that.

21:16.210 --> 21:17.609
That would be great.

21:17.745 --> 21:19.812
- And just so you know, I know
it can seem a little early,

21:19.947 --> 21:22.648
but a lot of kids around
her age learn about menses.

21:25.352 --> 21:28.420
- Uh huh, I'm sure.

21:28.422 --> 21:31.023
- And you just spoke about
menses, not intercourse?

21:31.025 --> 21:34.359
- No, just the first one.

21:34.361 --> 21:35.694
- Okay, got it.

21:35.696 --> 21:37.562
- Great.

21:37.698 --> 21:42.568
Then um, I will
see you at pickup.

21:43.304 --> 21:44.102
- Sounds good.

21:44.237 --> 21:44.903
- Great, have a good day.

21:44.905 --> 21:45.304
- You too.

21:48.041 --> 21:49.341
- He said menses.

21:54.748 --> 21:56.681
So, you had a good day.

21:56.817 --> 21:59.017
Did you learn anything new?

21:59.020 --> 22:00.952
- Yeah, I learned how
to count by fives.

22:01.088 --> 22:03.354
Five, 10, 15, 20.

22:03.356 --> 22:04.556
- Okay good.

22:04.558 --> 22:05.690
- [Mike] That's good,
that's a good one.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.158
- Can I have some more water?

22:07.294 --> 22:09.294
- Sure, you know what, why
don't you get it yourself?

22:09.296 --> 22:10.562
- Can I?

22:10.564 --> 22:11.763
- Oh yeah of course,
you're a big girl.

22:11.765 --> 22:13.298
- I'm gonna show
Walter how to do it.

22:13.300 --> 22:15.767
- Great, 'cause I'm sick
of that Walter bugging me

22:15.903 --> 22:17.035
to get him water all the time.

22:17.038 --> 22:18.503
- Oh boy.

22:18.638 --> 22:20.639
- Well I mean, we got through
the first week of kindergarten

22:20.774 --> 22:25.376
and only had to deal
with bullying, pubic
hair, and periods.

22:25.378 --> 22:26.177
- Not so terrible.

22:26.313 --> 22:27.178
- Right?

22:27.314 --> 22:28.513
- Yeah.

22:28.515 --> 22:29.714
- I mean I hope we get a
little bit of a breather

22:29.716 --> 22:31.316
before tackling
euthanasia and AIDS,

22:31.318 --> 22:34.119
but let's just assume
they cover that

22:34.121 --> 22:35.520
a little closer to the holidays.

22:35.522 --> 22:37.522
- Yeah, it's so Christmassy.

22:37.524 --> 22:38.924
- Yeah, there's nothing
that says Christmas

22:38.926 --> 22:40.859
like pulling the
plug on a loved one.

22:40.994 --> 22:42.127
- Yeah.

22:42.129 --> 22:43.728
- To help them out.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.864
Obviously I cannot speak

22:45.866 --> 22:48.399
for all the prostitutes
in the world,

22:48.401 --> 22:50.869
but people are willing
to pay more money

22:50.871 --> 22:52.604
for an exclusive luxury brand.

22:52.606 --> 22:55.073
- Okay, and how do you plan
on becoming so exclusive?

22:55.076 --> 22:56.341
- Glad you asked.

22:56.343 --> 22:57.208
I've thought about this.

22:57.344 --> 22:59.144
All my marketing, word of mouth.

22:59.146 --> 23:00.145
- Word of mouth?

23:00.280 --> 23:02.481
- Yeah, it creates the mystique.

23:02.616 --> 23:05.750
It's like going to a restaurant
that doesn't have a sign.

23:05.752 --> 23:08.754
Aren't you willing
to pay a little extra

23:08.889 --> 23:11.290
to know that you're
getting an experience

23:11.425 --> 23:13.625
that other people
aren't getting to enjoy.

23:13.761 --> 23:14.626
- Sure.

23:14.762 --> 23:15.827
- Obviously in this situation,

23:15.829 --> 23:17.228
the experience is my body.

23:17.364 --> 23:18.897
- You know I have to say,
I think most prostitutes

23:18.899 --> 23:20.432
do not have your
marketing savvy.

23:20.568 --> 23:21.833
- That's why I have a leg up.

23:21.835 --> 23:23.769
Actually, two legs
up, behind my head.

23:23.904 --> 23:24.903
- Actually they're not,

23:25.038 --> 23:26.571
because you can barely
touch your toes.

23:26.573 --> 23:27.806
- That is not true.

23:28.976 --> 23:29.708
I can very much touch.

23:29.843 --> 23:30.709
- Haven't seen it.

23:31.645 --> 23:32.311
How did it go?

23:32.446 --> 23:33.178
- Oh she's always great.

23:33.313 --> 23:34.379
- Oh good.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.047
She went to bed without
a thousand excuses?

23:36.049 --> 23:36.982
- Not quite that many.

23:37.117 --> 23:39.184
- Oof, well congratulations.

23:39.186 --> 23:40.986
- There was one thing,
and not a big deal,

23:40.988 --> 23:45.056
but just to let you know, she
did ask to see my clitoris.

23:45.058 --> 23:45.924
- Oh my god.

23:46.060 --> 23:48.059
- Oh wow.

23:48.195 --> 23:51.530
I recently have been teaching
her about the female anatomy

23:51.665 --> 23:54.133
so that must have just
been on her brain.

23:54.268 --> 23:57.136
- No it's fine, I wasn't pressed
she knew the correct term.

23:57.138 --> 24:01.940
- Okay, so do Venmo or Paypal,
or just how about all that.

24:01.942 --> 24:04.209
- Everything that's in your
wallet I think is appropriate.

24:04.211 --> 24:05.610
- Thank you.

24:05.746 --> 24:06.945
- You get a fee bump

24:06.947 --> 24:07.679
when you're asked to
show your clitoris.

24:07.681 --> 24:08.447
- Yeah.

24:10.350 --> 24:15.287
- So, what'd you think
of my work back there?

24:16.757 --> 24:17.689
- Well you know what, I think
it was worth every penny.

24:17.691 --> 24:18.690
- Yeah?

24:18.826 --> 24:19.758
You think it's the kind of thing

24:19.893 --> 24:21.493
that's gonna get people talking?

24:21.629 --> 24:23.895
- Oh, I think it will
start up a conversation.

24:24.031 --> 24:28.934
- Great, well then do me
a favor, spread the word.

24:30.170 --> 24:31.703
(laughing)

24:31.705 --> 24:33.038
Seriously, I'm gonna need
you to tell your friends.

24:33.173 --> 24:34.373
- Really?

24:34.375 --> 24:35.507
- Yeah.

24:35.509 --> 24:36.175
- Kevin?

24:36.310 --> 24:38.510
- Yes definitely Kevin.

24:38.512 --> 24:41.646
You know what, actually
just give me Kevin's number.

24:41.782 --> 24:42.881
I will reach out to him myself.
