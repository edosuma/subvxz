So nice of everyone to agree
to celebrate Christmas early.

00:24.028 --> 00:25.591
No one can say "no" to you, Willow.

00:25.616 --> 00:27.113
Well, I'm not sure
that that's true,

00:27.138 --> 00:29.186
but it has come to my attention

00:29.211 --> 00:31.073
that a tin of Christmas cookies

00:31.098 --> 00:33.073
can make all of the
difference when...

00:33.104 --> 00:34.804
asking for a favor.

00:35.528 --> 00:39.115
I'm already covering for you while
you're gone. What else do you need?

00:39.158 --> 00:41.403
I need someone to water my plants.

00:41.427 --> 00:43.644
Willow, you've got a lot of plants.

00:43.644 --> 00:44.932
I was hoping you hadn't noticed,

00:44.932 --> 00:46.163
but I'm gonna be
gone for four weeks,

00:46.188 --> 00:47.473
and they need a lot of love.

00:47.473 --> 00:49.281
It's very exciting that your
sister is getting married.

00:49.316 --> 00:51.267
You're gonna have a busy holiday.

00:51.285 --> 00:52.750
Yes. I think it's gonna be fun.

00:52.750 --> 00:54.096
And hopefully it
takes my mind off

00:54.121 --> 00:55.279
of getting transferred...

00:55.304 --> 00:56.293
Again.

00:56.318 --> 00:58.246
Every two years, like clockwork.

00:58.292 --> 01:00.025
Any idea where they're
gonna send you this time?

01:00.061 --> 01:03.114
I've heard we invested
in a ski resort in Colorado.

01:03.130 --> 01:04.629
So that's my best guess.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.816
There are worse places
to be transferred.

01:06.841 --> 01:09.086
- Do you like to ski?
- I guess I'll find out.

01:09.518 --> 01:11.302
About the plants...?

01:11.624 --> 01:14.273
I want more cookies.
Two dozen.

01:14.339 --> 01:15.475
Deal!

01:15.550 --> 01:16.708
[chuckles]

01:17.061 --> 01:19.620
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you, Willow.

01:20.227 --> 01:21.873

Juni!

02:14.459 --> 02:15.791
Willow! You're here!

02:15.791 --> 02:17.869
Of course I'm here!

02:18.276 --> 02:20.538
My baby sister
is getting married.

02:20.538 --> 02:21.840
Yeah, I am.

02:21.876 --> 02:24.060
In four weeks, I'm gonna be...

02:24.145 --> 02:26.177
- "Mrs. Austin Boyle."
- Mhm.

02:26.220 --> 02:27.773
"Juni Boyle."

02:27.798 --> 02:29.023
Mmmm.

02:29.048 --> 02:31.321
"Juni Petersen-hyphen-Boyle."

02:31.346 --> 02:33.062
You've been writing this in all
your notebooks, haven't you?

02:33.087 --> 02:33.997
Of course.

02:34.021 --> 02:37.022
Okay, so, wedding duty.
Put me to work.

02:37.057 --> 02:38.791
Come on. Mom's waiting.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.185
- Okay.
- Come here.

02:40.368 --> 02:42.001
[both giggling]

02:43.621 --> 02:45.420
Ah! Mom?

02:46.295 --> 02:48.517
- Willow!
- Ah!

02:48.569 --> 02:49.902
Oh!

02:49.937 --> 02:52.008
Look how beautiful you are!

02:52.008 --> 02:53.311
You too, Juni.

02:53.311 --> 02:54.505
Oh, my goodness.

02:54.533 --> 02:57.208
Everybody, look how
beautiful my daughter is.

02:57.526 --> 03:00.250
This is the best Christmas present ever.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.903
You're acting like I haven't
seen you in forever.

03:01.903 --> 03:03.595
You were just in New York
a couple months ago.

03:03.620 --> 03:05.423
Well, it's not the same
thing as having you home.

03:05.419 --> 03:06.451
Always so busy.

03:06.487 --> 03:09.950
She manages a big hotel in New York!

03:09.950 --> 03:11.943
And before that,
it was Chicago

03:11.968 --> 03:13.258
and before that, it was...

03:13.294 --> 03:14.422
- Phoenix!
- Right.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.782
And the assistant manager.

03:15.807 --> 03:16.695
Meh!

03:16.730 --> 03:17.663
You oversee everything.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.342
I mean, it's the
second-most important job.

03:19.367 --> 03:22.081
Manager/assistant manager,
tomato/to-mah-to.

03:23.367 --> 03:25.409
I'm just so proud of you.

03:25.445 --> 03:27.562
Thank you, mom.

03:27.648 --> 03:30.081
So, how goes the wedding prep?

03:30.349 --> 03:31.823
Snow.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.545
I'm gonna need more information
than that, mom.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.514
Too much of it
on the roof of the hall

03:35.549 --> 03:36.848
where we were
going to get married.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.517
They think it's gonna collapse
and they say

03:38.552 --> 03:40.285
they can't do anything about it
until it melts.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.221
What? When did this happen?

03:42.256 --> 03:43.622
Last week.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.624
Well, why didn't you call me?
I could've helped.

03:45.659 --> 03:46.725
What, with the roof?

03:46.760 --> 03:49.695
No, but I could've helped you
find another venue.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.230
I just...
I didn't want to bother you.

03:51.265 --> 03:52.864
And we've been looking,

03:52.900 --> 03:55.534
but none of
the good places are available.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.270
Although, we did find
a few possibilities

03:58.305 --> 04:00.405
that were okay.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.873
No. No. My sister's not
getting married in somewhere

04:01.909 --> 04:03.141
that's just "okay."

04:03.177 --> 04:05.377
well, it's better
than no place at all.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.813
Listen, if you just give me
a little bit of time,

04:07.848 --> 04:09.615
I'm sure I can find you
someplace spectacular.

04:09.650 --> 04:10.482
Everyone I talked to said

04:10.517 --> 04:13.619
all the spectacular places
are taken.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.255
[quiet determination]:
Well... They say that now.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.257
Uh-oh. I know that look.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.926
[chuckles]

04:20.961 --> 04:22.327
[Juni squeals]

04:22.363 --> 04:23.862
[laughter]
I'm go glad you're here.

04:25.532 --> 04:26.932
Right. Sure.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.233
But are you sure

04:28.269 --> 04:29.401
that there
isn't just a little bit

04:29.436 --> 04:31.737
of wiggle room in that schedule?

04:31.772 --> 04:34.239
No, I tried there,
they're booked solid.

04:34.275 --> 04:37.976
Same as the other
dozen places that I've called.

04:39.113 --> 04:40.412
Well, no, actually,

04:40.447 --> 04:43.148
I work at a hotel also,
so I do understand.

04:45.352 --> 04:49.121
[sighs] okay, well, please
call me if anything changes?

04:49.156 --> 04:50.922
Great. Thank you. Bye.

[footsteps]

05:15.849 --> 05:17.215
Hey, mom.

05:17.251 --> 05:20.352
Hi! You can help me
with the nativity scene.

05:20.387 --> 05:23.322
We need 24 animals
in the barnyard.

05:23.357 --> 05:25.724
Okay, listen, I have an idea
of where we could have...

05:25.759 --> 05:27.626
Why 24?

05:27.661 --> 05:30.495
Well, the coffee shop
up the street from the cafe

05:30.531 --> 05:32.531
has a dozen
in their nativity scene

05:32.566 --> 05:34.466
and I've always said
our diner is twice as good,

05:34.501 --> 05:36.501
so... There you go.

05:36.537 --> 05:37.703
Okay. It worries me

05:37.738 --> 05:40.372
that you went there
and counted...

05:40.407 --> 05:42.474
Look, I have an idea of where
Juni could get married.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.642
Where?

05:43.677 --> 05:45.077
Eagle ridge inn.

05:45.112 --> 05:47.212
Oh...

05:47.247 --> 05:49.648
Darling, they don't do weddings.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.351
No, david lyndon owns it now,

05:52.386 --> 05:54.686
and says there's no room
at the inn, so to speak.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.321
David lyndon.
Isn't that the name...

05:56.357 --> 05:57.255
Austin's best man?

05:57.291 --> 05:58.423
Yes.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.424
They work at the law firm
together.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.425
David said he wanted to help,

06:00.461 --> 06:02.928
but he said there's no space
for the ceremony.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.529
And he is selling it, so.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.630
Oh, he's selling it?

06:05.666 --> 06:08.567
Austin said he's got a buyer
who's very interested.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.936
Hmm. I just wish
there was some way

06:10.971 --> 06:12.003
of having the wedding there.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.439
I mean, it was such
a magical place to grow up.

06:14.475 --> 06:17.008
It was a wonderful place
to raise you kids.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.511
We loved owning the inn.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.880
And it would make
Juni so happy...

06:23.050 --> 06:24.716
[sighs, frustrated]

06:24.752 --> 06:26.852
Yes, it would.

06:27.955 --> 06:30.856
Yes, it would.

06:35.662 --> 06:37.195
Grandma, I need more glitter

06:37.231 --> 06:39.664
for Mrs. Jackson's
Christmas card.

06:40.768 --> 06:41.967
It's very sweet

06:42.002 --> 06:43.602
that you're making one
for a guest.

06:43.637 --> 06:44.469
She's a teacher.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.271
She helped me
with my math homework.

06:46.306 --> 06:47.105
Oh. Well, then yes,

06:47.141 --> 06:48.740
you definitely need
more glitter.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.275
[both chuckling]

06:50.310 --> 06:52.310
Mm! Good morning, mom.

06:52.346 --> 06:54.279
- Good morning, sweetie.
- Morning.

06:54.314 --> 06:55.714
Where is he?

06:55.749 --> 06:57.449
In the reception area
with garrett.

06:57.484 --> 06:59.551
Great. Wish me luck.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.253
Wait! Dad?

07:01.288 --> 07:02.587
You haven't found henry yet.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.156
I looked everywhere.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.924
I give up. Where'd you hide him?

07:05.959 --> 07:07.793
I can't tell you that.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.327
You have to find him.

07:09.363 --> 07:11.296
That's how it works.

07:11.331 --> 07:14.900
Right. You forgot where
you hid him, didn't you?

07:14.935 --> 07:16.902
No!

07:16.937 --> 07:18.303
Maybe.

07:18.338 --> 07:19.971
But... [sighs]

07:20.007 --> 07:21.907
It's still your job to find him.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.909
You know what?
You're right, it is my job,

07:23.944 --> 07:27.345
but it's also my job
not to be late for work.

07:27.381 --> 07:30.515
Your job
is not to be late for school.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.350
Okay, but...

07:32.386 --> 07:35.420
You'll look for him
after work tonight, right?

07:35.456 --> 07:37.088
You know what? We are gonna
look for him together.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.190
[smooch]

07:38.225 --> 07:39.624
You need more glitter.

07:39.660 --> 07:40.792
Exactly!

07:40.828 --> 07:42.527
Okay, you're sure you're okay
taking natalie to school?

07:42.563 --> 07:44.529
Partners need to be punctual.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.431
Prospective partners, mom.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.133
All right. Natalie,
you have a good day at school.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.468
Okay.

07:49.503 --> 07:51.503
You have a good day at work.

07:51.538 --> 07:52.804
I will. Thanks, sweetie.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.339
Go get your backpack, please.

07:54.374 --> 07:55.006
- Okay.
- All right.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.809
And you, go close the deal.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.811

08:15.829 --> 08:19.664
[♪♪♪]

08:35.616 --> 08:37.849
And the wiring
is in great shape.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.317
They just replaced it
about three years ago.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.186
Oh, that's good to hear.

08:41.221 --> 08:42.754
Robert.

08:42.789 --> 08:43.722
Sorry to keep you waiting.

08:43.756 --> 08:46.024
Ten-year-olds
are on their own timetable.

08:46.059 --> 08:46.992
Say no more.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.393
I had a few of those myself
a while back.

08:48.428 --> 08:49.628
It's the best.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.730
Has garrett been giving you
all the information you need?

08:51.765 --> 08:52.831
Yes, he's been great.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.534
So, does the purchase price
include the handyman?

08:55.569 --> 08:56.835
We'll talk.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.036
I'll leave you to it.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.204
Okay. Thanks, garrett.

09:01.642 --> 09:02.507
David, I gotta tell you,

09:02.543 --> 09:04.276
this is a beautiful place
you have here.

09:04.311 --> 09:05.677
Oh, thank you very much.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.546
It's gonna be tough
to say goodbye.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.180
Do you host events here?

09:09.216 --> 09:11.583
Yeah, we do luncheons,
receptions.

09:11.618 --> 09:12.784
Wedding receptions?

09:12.819 --> 09:13.952
We don't do weddings.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.520
We talked about
building a chapel,

09:15.556 --> 09:16.621
but we just never really
got around to it.

09:16.657 --> 09:17.589
We?

09:17.624 --> 09:18.957
My late wife and I.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.092
She had, uh, a lot of plans
for this place.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.594
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

09:22.629 --> 09:23.595
No, no, it's okay.

09:23.630 --> 09:24.629
I never asked,

09:24.665 --> 09:25.730
but why are you selling?

09:25.766 --> 09:28.533
Well, I am about to become
partner at my law firm.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.201
Hey! Congratulations.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.236
Thank you very much.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.071
Yeah, but, uh...

09:33.106 --> 09:35.740
I'm already too busy
to pay as much attention

09:35.776 --> 09:36.708
to the inn as it deserves,

09:36.743 --> 09:38.643
and with some changes
coming up at my job,

09:38.679 --> 09:39.711
I'm just gonna have
a lot of work to do,

09:39.746 --> 09:42.948
so I think it's just...
It's time to let it go.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.382
- Mm.
- But listen.

09:44.418 --> 09:45.450
You feel free to look around,

09:45.485 --> 09:48.420
and garrett will answer
any questions you need.

09:48.455 --> 09:49.988
- All right. Thank you, david.
- Thank you!

09:50.023 --> 09:51.456
- Okay.
- All right.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.961
[♪♪♪]

09:57.097 --> 09:59.731
Whew. Good morning, Mrs. Sachs.
How was your walk today?

09:59.766 --> 10:01.766
Oh, beautiful, just beautiful.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.402
Oh, there's nothing like
this blue ridge mountain air.

10:04.438 --> 10:05.637
Oh, I know.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.305
I only wish I could stay longer.

10:07.341 --> 10:08.673
Well, you are always welcome.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.242
Oh, I do hope
to come back someday.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.410
It's special here.

10:12.446 --> 10:13.578
Yeah.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.614
It is.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.718
[♪♪♪]

10:31.164 --> 10:32.197
Hello?

10:32.232 --> 10:33.131
Oh...

10:33.166 --> 10:34.366
Hello.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.001
Sorry. Can I help you?

10:36.036 --> 10:37.769
I'm looking for david lyndon.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.804
In the barn?

10:39.840 --> 10:42.474
No, it's about what
I would like to do to his barn.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.275
[laughs] I'm sorry.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.477
But you...

10:45.512 --> 10:46.811
Who are you?

10:46.847 --> 10:48.680
[laughs] I skipped that part,
didn't I?

10:48.715 --> 10:49.948
I'm sorry. I'm Willow petersen.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.016
- Oh...
- I...

10:51.051 --> 10:52.317
Actually grew up here.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.652
Petersen.

10:53.687 --> 10:54.552
Was your father hank?

10:54.588 --> 10:56.287
You guys used
to own this place, right?

10:56.323 --> 10:57.989
Yes, my father built the place.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.524
And my sister, Juni...

10:59.559 --> 11:00.859
Juni is getting married
to austin,

11:00.894 --> 11:02.527
who is my best friend.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.462
You're Juni's sister, Willow.
Okay.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.132
It's all coming together now.
I get it. Um...

11:07.167 --> 11:08.166
I just gotta say,

11:08.201 --> 11:10.468
your family did
a fantastic job of this place.

11:10.504 --> 11:11.436
Thank you, really.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.004
It was a great place
for a kid to grow up.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.506
Yes. Yes, indeed, indeed.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.642
Sorry, you were saying

11:17.678 --> 11:19.644
you wanted to do something
to my barn?

11:19.680 --> 11:21.980
Yes, so, speaking
of Juni and austin,

11:22.015 --> 11:23.715
you heard that they lost
their wedding venue.

11:23.750 --> 11:24.916
- Right?
- Yes.

11:24.951 --> 11:27.519
So I was just thinking that
they could get married here,

11:27.554 --> 11:28.687
at eagle ridge.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.855
Right. Yeah, no, actually,
we've had that conversation,

11:30.891 --> 11:31.790
but unfortunately,

11:31.825 --> 11:33.324
there's nowhere
to have the ceremony, so.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.960
Oh, but there is.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.329
The barn?

11:38.365 --> 11:41.700
Yeah. I mean, look at this...
There's enough space.

11:41.735 --> 11:45.170
With the right decor,
it would be absolutely gorgeous.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.338
I guess you haven't heard
I'm actually selling the inn.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.441
I did, but it's not sold yet.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.109
No, but we do have
a prospective buyer

11:51.144 --> 11:53.278
who's on the fence right now,
but it's looking pretty good.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.346
But maybe he could just
wait a couple weeks

11:55.382 --> 11:56.915
until after Christmas.

11:56.950 --> 11:57.982
It's only a few weeks away.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.418
Right. Four weeks to organize
an entire wedding,

12:00.454 --> 12:01.553
get all the stuff, and plus,

12:01.588 --> 12:02.921
the inn needs some work.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.522
Which I would oversee, bec...

12:04.558 --> 12:06.391
Did you know, I actually,
I work in hospitality,

12:06.426 --> 12:09.294
and I do a lot of events
for my company's hotels.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.895
And, when you think about it,

12:10.931 --> 12:12.363
hosting a wedding here

12:12.399 --> 12:15.533
would be kind of like
staging it for your sale.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.602
- Huh.
- Mm.

12:17.637 --> 12:18.536
The buyer
was asking about weddings.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.739
Right? We can show him
the possibilities.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.774
- We?
- Yes! Well, me.

12:22.809 --> 12:24.142
I would do all of the work.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.276
You wouldn't
have to do anything.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.812
It's just the cost and the...

12:27.848 --> 12:29.047
No, my family's paying
for everything

12:29.082 --> 12:30.381
that has to do with the wedding.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.783
Look, I would absolutely
love to help,

12:31.818 --> 12:33.785
I mean, I'm austin's best man,

12:33.820 --> 12:36.554
but I just, I don't really have
any time for this right now.

12:36.590 --> 12:37.822
I'm very busy,

12:37.858 --> 12:38.790
and I gotta go to work
right now.

12:38.825 --> 12:40.492
Sure, but maybe...

12:40.527 --> 12:41.926
- It was so nice...
- But...

12:41.962 --> 12:43.094
To meet you, Willow.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.263
You too! Or we could talk...

12:45.298 --> 12:47.599
[sighs]

12:47.634 --> 12:49.234
[words catch]

12:49.269 --> 12:50.802
[shouts] do you like cookies?

12:53.840 --> 12:55.740
Is this too low?

12:55.776 --> 12:57.642
Who wants to get married
in a barn?

12:57.677 --> 12:58.943
I mean, it's a barn.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.278
Yeah, this is too low.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.080
Someone's gonna run into this
and sue me...

13:02.115 --> 13:03.448
It was just so out of the blue,
you know?

13:03.483 --> 13:04.783
Which would be ironic.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.184
Hey. You listening to me?

13:06.219 --> 13:07.318
What?

13:07.354 --> 13:08.686
I said... Whoa, that's too low.

13:08.722 --> 13:10.288
Well, can you help me out then?

13:10.323 --> 13:11.256
No, I can't,

13:11.291 --> 13:13.324
because I am gonna go
dazzle the partners

13:13.360 --> 13:15.160
with my brilliant legal mind.

13:15.195 --> 13:16.694
Well, how are you gonna do that?

13:16.730 --> 13:18.863
Mm, I guess, I'll say
"ergo" and "to wit" a lot,

13:18.899 --> 13:20.131
'cause they love that stuff.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.800
Shocking
you haven't made partner yet.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.434
- Mm.
- Hey, hey.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.836
- Ask about secret santa.
- What about it?

13:24.871 --> 13:25.770
I sent in a proposal

13:25.806 --> 13:27.872
to up the maximum gift price
to 30 bucks.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.175
Right. How much was
that portable putting green

13:30.210 --> 13:31.376
you wanted for your office?

13:31.411 --> 13:32.777
Um, $29.99.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.279
- Exactly.
- It's a coincidence.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.880
Okay.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.515
Listen.

13:37.551 --> 13:39.951
You know that I would
host the ceremony

13:39.986 --> 13:41.319
if I thought
I could make it work, right?

13:41.354 --> 13:43.054
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't worry about it.

13:43.089 --> 13:44.722
- Okay.
- We'll figure it out.

13:44.758 --> 13:46.391
- We will, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

13:46.426 --> 13:47.692
- Okay.
- All right.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.929
[sighs] it is too low.

13:53.567 --> 13:56.501
We are gonna need
a lot more jellybeans.

13:56.536 --> 13:57.836
You have enough for that.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.304
This is only the beginning.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.172
This is the guest house, hon!

14:01.208 --> 14:02.974
Oh, I see.

14:03.009 --> 14:06.077
The coffee shop down the street
has a gingerbread house

14:06.112 --> 14:07.846
and yours has to be
that much bigger and better?

14:07.881 --> 14:09.080
I'm simply showing

14:09.115 --> 14:10.882
that brogan's diner
is the place to be

14:10.917 --> 14:12.483
for the true spirit
of Christmas.

14:12.519 --> 14:13.618
[laughs]

14:16.256 --> 14:18.089
Jun, you're kind of quiet.

14:18.124 --> 14:20.258
I'm just thinking about
how special it would be

14:20.293 --> 14:22.560
to get married at eagle ridge.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.563
[sighs] I'm sorry.

14:25.599 --> 14:27.198
I shouldn't have
even said anything.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.900
You know, I tried.

14:28.935 --> 14:30.501
He just wouldn't even
consider it.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.569
Give the guy a break.

14:31.605 --> 14:33.771
You know, it must be...
It must be tough for him.

14:33.807 --> 14:34.772
What, selling the inn?

14:34.808 --> 14:35.773
Needing to sell the inn

14:35.809 --> 14:38.209
because you can't do it
by yourself anymore.

14:38.245 --> 14:41.646
Not ever intending to do it
by yourself in the first place.

14:42.816 --> 14:44.849
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.451
I didn't think about it
that way.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.286
How did you do it, mom?

14:48.321 --> 14:50.388
You went right from the inn
to the restaurant,

14:50.423 --> 14:52.257
and you raised two kids
while doing it.

14:52.292 --> 14:54.559
Well... [chuckles]

14:54.594 --> 14:56.527
You know what?

14:56.563 --> 14:57.595
It's like a house.

14:57.631 --> 14:58.863
You have a solid foundation,

14:58.899 --> 15:01.599
you can make it
whatever you want.

15:02.769 --> 15:05.436
Your dad and I made...

15:05.472 --> 15:07.171
A pretty solid foundation.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.744
[♪♪♪]

15:12.779 --> 15:15.280
Mwah... Mwah.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.382
- I love you.
- I love you.

15:19.986 --> 15:22.787
[♪♪♪]

15:26.960 --> 15:28.393
Hey, sweetie.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.361
Henry wasn't
in the kitchen either.

15:31.464 --> 15:32.764
But dad...

15:32.799 --> 15:34.732
I know, I know,
but we've looked everywhere.

15:34.768 --> 15:37.101
He's gonna turn up eventually,
I promise.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.503
In the meantime,

15:38.538 --> 15:40.738
you've got all
your stuffed animals right here.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.142
But henry's my favorite.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.778
Mom gave him to me.

15:46.813 --> 15:47.845
I know.

15:47.881 --> 15:51.082
And since this is our last
Christmas at the inn,

15:51.117 --> 15:52.617
I'll need henry more than ever.

15:52.652 --> 15:56.754
Right. So, we're gonna keep
looking for him tomorrow,

15:56.790 --> 15:58.790
and we'll find him, I promise.

15:58.825 --> 16:01.292
I still don't understand
why we have to move.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.161
[sighing softly]

16:03.196 --> 16:06.297
Well... It's like I've said.

16:06.333 --> 16:09.167
My job's about to become
a lot bigger,

16:09.202 --> 16:11.769
and I'm not gonna have as much
time to devote to the inn.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.771
But grandma helps.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.106
And garrett, too.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.708
And I can do more.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.476
Hey.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.011
Remember last year,

16:20.046 --> 16:22.180
when we donated some
of your toys to the church?

16:22.215 --> 16:24.215
Yeah, they were ones

16:24.250 --> 16:25.984
I didn't have time
to play with anymore.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.385
Right.

16:27.420 --> 16:28.953
But there are kids out there

16:28.989 --> 16:30.488
that do have time
to play with toys,

16:30.523 --> 16:32.790
and toys do need someone
to play with them, right?

16:32.826 --> 16:33.958
Right.

16:33.994 --> 16:36.627
Well, that's kind of
like the inn.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.896
You know? It needs someone
to pay attention to it

16:38.932 --> 16:41.199
in ways that I can't anymore.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.534
Someone who can...

16:43.570 --> 16:46.337
Love it, care for it,
like we have.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.373
That's a lot of love.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.174
That is a lot of love.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.143
I'm gonna miss it here.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.846
Yeah. Me too.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.647
[chuckles softly]

16:56.683 --> 16:57.815
Hey. Get some sleep.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.684
[laughs]

16:59.719 --> 17:01.386
Goodnight, dad.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.388
Goodnight, sweetie.

17:04.590 --> 17:06.891
Mwah! All right.

17:06.925 --> 17:09.527
[♪♪♪]

17:15.068 --> 17:16.166
[laughing]

17:16.202 --> 17:18.002
Well, thanks for picking up
the tab for lunch, dad.

17:18.038 --> 17:19.270
Oh, happy to.

17:19.305 --> 17:20.704
You take us out all the time.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.205
- Willow.
- Willow?

17:22.242 --> 17:23.840
Hi.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.076
Yeah, hey.

17:25.111 --> 17:26.277
- Hello.
- Hey.

17:26.311 --> 17:28.746
Uh, mom, dad,
this is Juni's sister.

17:28.782 --> 17:30.515
- You're Willow!
- Yes.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.017
Linda talks about you
all the time at the diner.

17:33.053 --> 17:33.951
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:33.987 --> 17:35.453
Oh, don't be silly.

17:35.488 --> 17:38.089
Being proud of our kids
is part of our job.

17:38.124 --> 17:40.191
Like this one is about
to become partner

17:40.226 --> 17:41.259
at his law firm.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.194
Yes, I heard. Congratulations.

17:43.229 --> 17:46.097
Thank you, but, again,
I'm not partner yet,

17:46.132 --> 17:47.231
and it's definitely
not gonna happen

17:47.267 --> 17:48.299
if I take lunches this long,

17:48.334 --> 17:50.101
so I should get back to work.

17:50.136 --> 17:52.303
But it was great
to see you, Willow.

17:52.338 --> 17:54.605
Actually, would you mind if
I walked with you a little ways?

17:54.641 --> 17:55.973
No.

17:56.009 --> 17:57.542
Great. Nice to meet you.

17:57.577 --> 17:58.576
See you, guys.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.711
- You too, Willow.
- Bye now.

18:00.747 --> 18:01.779
So, uh...

18:01.815 --> 18:03.314
About the wedding.

18:03.349 --> 18:06.951
I do think that putting on
one big event

18:06.986 --> 18:09.454
before you leave
could help you sell it, though.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.756
I mean, really,
Christmas used to be spectacular

18:11.791 --> 18:12.824
at eagle ridge.

18:12.859 --> 18:16.160
We would go all out
with lights and decorations.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.295
We used to have carriage rides.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.896
Wow. Carriage rides?

18:18.932 --> 18:21.099
Yes, you know, like a hay ride,

18:21.134 --> 18:22.100
but without the snow.

18:22.135 --> 18:23.901
It was the closest thing
that people could get

18:23.937 --> 18:25.002
to a sleigh ride.

18:25.038 --> 18:26.437
They used to love it.

18:26.473 --> 18:27.972
What I mean is,

18:28.007 --> 18:32.410
don't you want one last
spectacular Christmas there,

18:32.445 --> 18:33.644
before you leave?

18:33.680 --> 18:37.615
I mean,
I know that natalie would,

18:37.650 --> 18:39.283
but I just, I gotta tell you,

18:39.319 --> 18:40.985
I just don't have the time
to do anything.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.286
Oh, I-I would do everything.

18:42.322 --> 18:43.321
Everything.

18:43.356 --> 18:46.190
I would do Christmas,
I would do the wedding.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.458
I could even bring in a team

18:47.494 --> 18:49.260
to do any repairs
that you could need.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.162
I've actually got
a repairman, garrett,

18:51.197 --> 18:52.730
he could actually
take care of all that.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.700
Why is this so important to you?

18:55.735 --> 18:58.469
My family built eagle ridge.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.705
It's Juni's big day.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.840
It's just very important to us.

19:02.876 --> 19:04.976
I wouldn't have to do anything?

19:05.011 --> 19:07.812
I would do absolutely
all of the work.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.614
You wouldn't even
know that we are there.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.716
And david...

19:11.751 --> 19:15.753
You would be making a lot of
Christmas wishes come true.

19:16.890 --> 19:18.189
I don't want to go too crazy.

19:18.224 --> 19:19.690
Is that a yes?

19:21.094 --> 19:22.059
To Christmas wishes...

19:22.095 --> 19:23.761
To Christmas wishes.

19:34.174 --> 19:36.707
[♪♪♪]

19:36.743 --> 19:38.509
Okay, now, since the reception

19:38.545 --> 19:40.411
will be spilling out
into this room,

19:40.446 --> 19:41.679
I think it needs some attention.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.414
What are you thinking?

19:43.449 --> 19:46.851
Well, the floors could use
a good polish

19:46.886 --> 19:49.520
and I think we need
a new coat of paint.

19:49.556 --> 19:52.323
Sorry. You're... Painting?

19:52.358 --> 19:53.925
Of course.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.327
Oh. I just kind of thought
you were tidying up.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.429
I mean, this room doesn't even
need to be painted, does it?

19:58.464 --> 20:02.033
We're just sprucing it up
a little bit.

20:02.068 --> 20:04.101
I'd keep it simple, I promise.
Let me show you some swatches.

20:04.137 --> 20:05.736
Oh, you know what,
I just came home for lunch.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.004
Five minutes, I promise.

20:09.075 --> 20:10.908
Stop encouraging her.

20:12.612 --> 20:13.578
- So...
- Okay.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.182
Oh, hi!

20:18.218 --> 20:20.284
I was hoping I was gonna run
into you before I left.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.485
I literally
just walked in the door.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.254
Oh, but I need to talk to you
about something important.

20:23.289 --> 20:24.288
Christmas decorations.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.524
I think we have plenty already.
Do we need more?

20:26.559 --> 20:28.593
I think we need to talk about
adding more lights.

20:28.628 --> 20:29.327
How many more?

20:29.362 --> 20:30.761
Well, probably a strand or two.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.396
Five at the most.

20:32.432 --> 20:35.366
We also need to re-open
the discussion about paint.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.969
Paint? But I...

20:38.004 --> 20:40.104
So, here's what I'm thinking.

20:40.139 --> 20:42.740
We put the altar down here.

20:42.775 --> 20:43.774
Okay, no, that's great.

20:43.810 --> 20:46.544
Austin and I will be there
in 30 minutes, max.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.379
45 minutes, max.

20:48.414 --> 20:50.047
Okay, can you just go ahead
and read it to me?

20:50.083 --> 20:51.015
So do you really think

20:51.050 --> 20:52.650
you can make this place
look good in time?

20:52.685 --> 20:54.051
Oh, yeah, I mean,
it's mainly cosmetic.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.086
It'll be a snap.

20:55.121 --> 20:57.588
Great. So you won't mind
if we add a few things?

20:57.624 --> 20:58.789
Oh, like what?

20:58.825 --> 21:00.258
The wedding's two days
before Christmas,

21:00.293 --> 21:02.126
so we want trees.

21:02.161 --> 21:04.328
Trees, plural?

21:04.364 --> 21:06.597
Yes. Like,
eight or nine of them.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.065
Yeah, and lots of decorations.

21:08.101 --> 21:10.568
Yes, and garlands
and wreaths and bows,

21:10.603 --> 21:11.969
the whole nine yards.

21:12.005 --> 21:13.070
Wait, I... Hold on one sec?

21:13.106 --> 21:14.505
I... [stammers]

21:14.540 --> 21:16.641
One tree is plenty. Did...

21:27.654 --> 21:30.087
[footsteps]

21:30.123 --> 21:31.756
[dejected sigh]

21:33.059 --> 21:34.959
Hi. Did you lose something?

21:34.994 --> 21:37.161
Uh, well, sort of.

21:38.998 --> 21:41.165
I hid something
and now I can't find it.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.501
Oh, uh, what is it?

21:44.504 --> 21:46.270
Henry.

21:46.306 --> 21:47.805
Who's henry?

21:47.840 --> 21:49.440
My reindeer.

21:49.475 --> 21:50.608
Oh.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.443
He's my best friend.

21:52.478 --> 21:56.213
Well, except for rona,
she's like my best real friend,

21:56.249 --> 21:58.449
but henry is like
my best toy friend.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.718
Right, and now you don't know
where he is?

22:00.753 --> 22:02.887
Dad and I play hide-and-seek
with him.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.455
It was my turn to hide him,

22:04.490 --> 22:07.558
and I found
a really good spot, but...

22:07.593 --> 22:09.660
Now I don't remember
where it was.

22:09.696 --> 22:13.197
Okay, well, why don't you
just tell me what he looks like,

22:13.232 --> 22:14.732
and I will
keep an eye out for him.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.467
Okay, well, he's a reindeer...

22:16.502 --> 22:17.468
Right.

22:17.503 --> 22:18.703
About this big...

22:18.738 --> 22:22.373
Natalie, I took a look again
upstairs, but I couldn't... oh.

22:22.408 --> 22:23.240
Hi.

22:23.276 --> 22:25.376
Hi. I didn't know
you were still here.

22:25.411 --> 22:26.977
Well, I was on my way out,

22:27.013 --> 22:29.914
but then I ran into
who I presume is natalie?

22:29.949 --> 22:32.016
Yes, of course, natalie,
this is Willow.

22:32.051 --> 22:33.417
She's the one
I was telling you about,

22:33.453 --> 22:35.052
who's doing all the work
around the inn.

22:35.088 --> 22:36.487
You're the Christmas lady!

22:36.522 --> 22:37.388
The what?

22:37.423 --> 22:39.056
You're the Christmas lady.

22:39.092 --> 22:41.692
Dad said you're doing
all sorts of Christmas stuff

22:41.728 --> 22:42.727
around the inn.

22:42.762 --> 22:44.562
It's making him crazy.

22:44.597 --> 22:45.629
[laughs, horrified]

22:47.200 --> 22:49.166
Crazy... Excited.

22:49.202 --> 22:50.835
Is it true

22:50.870 --> 22:52.703
we're gonna have
a million Christmas trees?

22:52.739 --> 22:53.704
Is it?

22:53.740 --> 22:55.673
Uh, no. No.

22:55.708 --> 22:56.707
Not a million,

22:56.743 --> 22:58.909
but there will be a lot.

22:58.945 --> 23:00.010
I'm actually going

23:00.046 --> 23:01.345
to the Christmas tree lot
tonight.

23:01.381 --> 23:03.581
Oh, dad! Can we go?

23:03.616 --> 23:05.383
I want to pick out
a tree for us, too.

23:05.418 --> 23:07.885
You know what?
We are going on the weekend.

23:09.489 --> 23:10.554
But dad...

23:10.590 --> 23:12.556
If Willow gets hers tonight
and we get ours later,

23:12.592 --> 23:13.758
they won't match.

23:13.793 --> 23:16.060
But they're all the same,
aren't they?

23:16.095 --> 23:19.764
No, each tree is unique
and special in its own way.

23:22.268 --> 23:23.367
Yeah, dad.

23:27.173 --> 23:28.072
I mean...

23:28.107 --> 23:31.609
Once you put on the lights
and decorations,

23:31.644 --> 23:32.877
you won't even be able
to tell the difference.

23:35.281 --> 23:36.947
I will.

23:36.983 --> 23:38.249
Please, dad?

23:41.087 --> 23:42.086
[sighs grudgingly]

23:42.121 --> 23:44.555
Okay, I guess we're going
tree-shopping tonight.

23:44.590 --> 23:45.823
Yay!

23:45.858 --> 23:47.258
- Thank you, dad!
- [laughing] you're welcome.

23:47.293 --> 23:48.959
- I'll go get my coat!
- Okay.

23:48.995 --> 23:51.128
[natalie giggling]

23:51.164 --> 23:53.130
[♪♪♪]

23:54.500 --> 23:56.567
Ooh... This one.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.102
And this one!

23:58.137 --> 23:59.503
This one.

23:59.539 --> 24:01.672
Ooh! This one's pretty, too.

24:01.707 --> 24:04.141
You've liked
every tree in the lot.

24:04.177 --> 24:06.844
That's because all of them
have been pretty great so far.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.345
Yes.

24:08.381 --> 24:09.780
I'm gonna go look
at the trees over there.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.649
I'll tell you
if I find any good ones.

24:13.186 --> 24:14.852
[Willow laughs]

24:14.887 --> 24:17.288
Has she always been, uh,
this enthusiastic?

24:17.323 --> 24:20.124
Yeah. It's... A lot sometimes.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.826
I was actually the exact same
way when I was little.

24:21.861 --> 24:23.928
Everything had to be
turned up to 11,

24:23.963 --> 24:25.129
especially at Christmas.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.497
So, not a lot has changed?

24:26.532 --> 24:28.365
Look, I thought we agreed,

24:28.401 --> 24:30.868
I just want to put on
a beautiful wedding

24:30.903 --> 24:32.336
and have an excellent Christmas.

24:32.371 --> 24:33.237
And I thought we agreed

24:33.272 --> 24:34.538
that that's what was best
for everybody.

24:34.574 --> 24:36.707
Right, no, I was just wondering
when we're gonna get to the part

24:36.742 --> 24:38.676
where I don't have
to worry about anything?

24:38.711 --> 24:40.544
Tomorrow. Friday at the latest.

24:40.580 --> 24:41.512
I'm serious, Willow.

24:41.547 --> 24:43.214
I can't keep getting
pulled away from work

24:43.249 --> 24:45.316
to give your sister
her dream wedding...

24:45.351 --> 24:46.417
Which apparently involves

24:46.452 --> 24:49.186
every Christmas tree
in existence, for some reason.

24:49.222 --> 24:50.788
It's not just about the wedding.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.790
It's about getting your buyer
off the fence

24:52.825 --> 24:54.625
and putting on
a spectacular event

24:54.660 --> 24:55.593
that shows off

24:55.628 --> 24:58.195
what a magical place
eagle ridge really is.

24:58.231 --> 25:00.164
I hear you,
and I appreciate that,

25:00.199 --> 25:01.298
I really do,

25:01.334 --> 25:02.666
but the reason
I'm selling the inn

25:02.702 --> 25:04.869
is because I need to focus on
becoming partner,

25:04.904 --> 25:06.170
and that has to come first.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.239
Look, all I'm saying is

25:08.274 --> 25:09.974
you said you were gonna
take care of everything,

25:10.009 --> 25:12.042
and that hasn't been the case.

25:12.078 --> 25:14.712
You know what? You're right.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.146
As of right now,

25:16.182 --> 25:17.181
you're off the hook.

25:17.216 --> 25:19.149
Thank you.

25:19.185 --> 25:20.351
- Dad!
- Hey.

25:20.386 --> 25:23.387
Come on, I need to show you
all the trees I picked out.

25:23.422 --> 25:25.689
Tomorrow. Friday at the latest.

25:32.498 --> 25:35.232
Sure. No, the payroll company
does all that.

25:35.268 --> 25:37.902
Yeah, you just have to approve
the time sheets.

25:37.937 --> 25:39.370
Thanks, tasha. Bye.

25:42.842 --> 25:43.974
- I'm sorry...
- [robert gasps] oh!

25:44.010 --> 25:45.743
- [robert laughing]
- I'm so sorry!

25:45.778 --> 25:47.578
I just didn't
want to get in your picture.

25:47.613 --> 25:50.481
Sorry, I was just daydreaming,
I guess.

25:50.516 --> 25:52.750
That's okay.
I just hope it was a good dream.

25:52.785 --> 25:53.784
It might be.

25:53.819 --> 25:56.587
In fact, I was just imagining
what this place

25:56.622 --> 25:59.723
might look like with
more Christmas decorations.

25:59.759 --> 26:01.025
I'm thinking
about buying the place.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.560
Oh!

26:02.595 --> 26:05.195
Please, allow me. Picture this.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.130
Sparking lights...

26:06.165 --> 26:09.433
On the roof, around the windows,
the eaves,

26:09.468 --> 26:11.001
garlands with bows,
of course, every five feet.

26:11.037 --> 26:12.836
More wreaths,
and here, on the rocks,

26:12.872 --> 26:15.105
light-up snowmen.

26:15.141 --> 26:16.407
[laughs] you've really
thought this out.

26:16.442 --> 26:18.676
I actually grew up here.

26:18.711 --> 26:20.544
My family
used to own eagle ridge.

26:20.580 --> 26:21.512
Really?

26:21.547 --> 26:23.180
Yeah.

26:23.215 --> 26:24.982
What was it like
growing up here?

26:26.786 --> 26:30.754
I was just so lucky. You know?

26:30.790 --> 26:32.356
Anyway, do you have children?

26:32.391 --> 26:34.024
Two daughters,
but they're grown.

26:34.060 --> 26:35.059
Grand kids or...?

26:35.094 --> 26:35.960
Mm. Not yet.

26:35.995 --> 26:37.895
Right, well, when you do,

26:37.930 --> 26:39.563
they're gonna love it here.

26:39.599 --> 26:41.632
Hmm.

26:41.667 --> 26:42.800
I wish I could've
seen this place

26:42.835 --> 26:44.702
the way it used to be.

26:44.737 --> 26:47.204
Anyway, I'm so sorry
for being in the way.

26:47.239 --> 26:48.572
Not at all. Stop, you're not.

26:48.608 --> 26:49.773
- Robert.
- Willow.

26:49.809 --> 26:50.908
- Nice to meet you.
- And you.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.043
[both] take care.

26:53.079 --> 26:55.279
[♪♪♪]

27:00.586 --> 27:02.653
All right, so you got the file
for the harrison merger?

27:02.688 --> 27:03.887
Yeah, yeah, I got it right here.

27:03.923 --> 27:04.888
[grumbles] aw.

27:04.924 --> 27:05.723
What? What's wrong?

27:05.758 --> 27:08.158
Willow needs me
at the inn, again.

27:08.194 --> 27:09.226
Okay, well,
don't worry about it.

27:09.261 --> 27:10.461
I can cover this.

27:10.496 --> 27:12.062
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm good. Go.

27:12.098 --> 27:14.965
All right. Thank you.
Go get 'em.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.170
So, everything's on track?

27:20.206 --> 27:21.639
Yes, it is.

27:21.674 --> 27:23.407
Okay, because you do know

27:23.442 --> 27:25.909
that Christmas and the wedding
are in three weeks.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.044
Three and a half, more or less.

27:27.079 --> 27:29.613
Okay, at the hotel,
where I work with spreadsheets,

27:29.649 --> 27:31.248
there's no such thing
as "more or less"

27:31.283 --> 27:32.916
in a spreadsheet, so...

27:32.952 --> 27:35.085
Well, before I worked here,
I was a contractor,

27:35.121 --> 27:36.453
and we specialize
in "more or less."

27:36.489 --> 27:37.454
okay. Don't worry.

27:37.490 --> 27:38.522
Everything will get done.

27:38.557 --> 27:40.991
It's like Christmas.

27:41.027 --> 27:42.426
You just gotta believe.

27:42.461 --> 27:44.928
Willow, what's up?
I got your text.

27:44.964 --> 27:46.463
- Hey. Okay.
- Hey.

27:46.499 --> 27:49.633
Tell me what you see.

27:49.669 --> 27:51.101
Is this a trick question?

27:51.137 --> 27:53.370
No. Just look at the inn
and tell me...

27:53.406 --> 27:55.105
Willow, I don't have
time for this.

27:55.141 --> 27:56.373
Okay, fine,
I will tell you what I see.

27:56.409 --> 27:57.341
Okay.

27:57.376 --> 27:58.809
We need more Christmas.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.811
I think we have
plenty of Christmas.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.312
Nope. Not according
to your prospective buyer,

28:02.348 --> 28:03.514
robert?

28:03.549 --> 28:05.015
I ran into him, right here,

28:05.051 --> 28:06.717
and he was just saying
that he wishes

28:06.752 --> 28:10.821
he could see the inn done up,
full Christmas spectacular.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.556
And you think
that'll convince him to buy it?

28:12.591 --> 28:14.291
I think that he needs
a reason to believe

28:14.326 --> 28:15.125
that the inn is special,

28:15.161 --> 28:16.860
and he just
hasn't found one yet.

28:16.896 --> 28:18.962
But, I mean, lights and garland
are temporary.

28:18.998 --> 28:20.998
He can do whatever he wants
with the inn when he owns it.

28:21.033 --> 28:21.865
Look, for whatever reason,

28:21.901 --> 28:24.001
he's having
a hard time picturing it.

28:24.036 --> 28:26.170
He needs to see it,
not just hear about it.

28:27.506 --> 28:29.473
Okay. What do you have in mind?

28:30.776 --> 28:32.609
Okay.

28:34.113 --> 28:36.747
I didn't realize
how much I missed it here.

28:36.782 --> 28:39.416
So you don't ever
come home for Christmas?

28:39.452 --> 28:41.485
I just usually only get
a day or two off.

28:41.520 --> 28:44.922
Between family and friends,
I haven't been making it down.

28:44.957 --> 28:47.224
[sighing] I just love it.
Do you like it?

28:47.259 --> 28:49.893
It's really nice.

28:49.929 --> 28:52.229
It is a little bit sad, though,

28:52.264 --> 28:55.733
that you have to sell the inn
in order to be partner.

28:55.768 --> 28:58.001
Well, I've been
working toward it

28:58.037 --> 28:59.570
since law school.

28:59.605 --> 29:01.205
It's actually nice to finally
get back on track.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.207
How so?

29:03.242 --> 29:05.042
I had a plan.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.777
You know?

29:06.812 --> 29:08.712
Law school, pass the bar,

29:08.748 --> 29:11.915
get married, have a kid,
and make partner.

29:11.951 --> 29:14.585
But, sadly, things got derailed

29:14.620 --> 29:17.054
when my wife died
a few years ago.

29:17.089 --> 29:19.089
Right. I'm sorry.

29:19.125 --> 29:20.557
What was her name?

29:20.593 --> 29:22.526
Shelly.

29:22.561 --> 29:24.962
The inn was really her passion.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.697
I mean, don't get me wrong,

29:26.732 --> 29:28.532
natalie and I
love it there, too,

29:28.567 --> 29:30.434
but it's just...

29:30.469 --> 29:32.035
Time to move on.

29:34.006 --> 29:35.873
How did you deal with it when
you guys had to sell the inn?

29:35.908 --> 29:37.074
Not very well.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.976
I was 15.

29:39.011 --> 29:42.446
It was right after
my dad passed and...

29:42.481 --> 29:45.315
Yeah, finding out
we needed to sell eagle ridge

29:45.351 --> 29:48.218
it was...
It was another huge loss.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.956
I'm sorry, too.

29:52.992 --> 29:55.259
I think it's part of why
I do what I do,

29:55.294 --> 29:57.294
that I wanted to be
in the hotel industry.

29:57.329 --> 30:01.131
I wanted to recapture some of
what I experienced as a kid,

30:01.167 --> 30:02.766
you know,
share that with people.

30:02.802 --> 30:03.934
Have you?

30:03.969 --> 30:06.103
I try...

30:06.138 --> 30:07.838
But it's different.

30:07.873 --> 30:09.606
Yeah.

30:09.642 --> 30:11.408
I get transferred around a lot,

30:11.443 --> 30:14.344
I never truly feel
settled anywhere.

30:14.380 --> 30:16.513
But I think that maybe when
I'm managing my own property,

30:16.549 --> 30:17.848
it'll be different,

30:17.883 --> 30:20.284
it'll feel
more fulfilling somehow.

30:20.319 --> 30:22.786
Ah, someday, right?

30:24.123 --> 30:26.089
Why not today?

30:26.125 --> 30:28.425
'Cause today is scary.

30:32.698 --> 30:34.431
Hey.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.233
What about that wreath there,
for the barn door?

30:38.470 --> 30:39.670
We'll take it.

30:39.705 --> 30:41.839
Oh, I got it.

30:43.876 --> 30:46.109
That's the spirit!

30:47.847 --> 30:48.979
It's so cold out.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.180
Wow!

30:50.216 --> 30:51.849
Put on your gloves.
It's freezing.

30:51.884 --> 30:52.983
Wow!

30:53.018 --> 30:55.152
[all chuckling]

30:55.187 --> 30:56.453
Well, what do you think?

30:56.488 --> 30:58.522
I love it.

30:58.557 --> 31:01.325
But I think we need
to give the snowmen names.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.693
I think so, too.

31:02.728 --> 31:04.461
Did you have anything in mind?

31:04.496 --> 31:05.729
Hmm...

31:05.764 --> 31:08.832
Prancer, comet,
donner, and blitzen.

31:08.868 --> 31:11.235
Those are reindeer names.

31:11.270 --> 31:13.237
They can be snowmen names, too.

31:13.272 --> 31:15.005
That's a good point.

31:16.675 --> 31:18.141
Don't they light up?

31:18.177 --> 31:19.710
Yes, they do.

31:19.745 --> 31:20.677
We are just waiting for garrett

31:20.713 --> 31:22.079
to put the finishing touches
on the lights,

31:22.114 --> 31:23.347
then we'll turn 'em on.

31:23.382 --> 31:24.915
Is this what Christmas was like

31:24.950 --> 31:26.550
when you were a kid
here, Willow?

31:26.585 --> 31:30.020
Why, yes, it was actually
a lot like this.

31:30.055 --> 31:32.022
The whole family would
get together and decorate.

31:32.057 --> 31:34.324
We'd sing Christmas carols,
we'd drink hot chocolate.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.993
It was... Mm.

31:36.028 --> 31:37.494
Hot cocoa. I've got some made.

31:37.529 --> 31:38.395
Oh!

31:38.430 --> 31:41.031
Good. Let's go get it.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.201
Do you miss it?

31:44.236 --> 31:47.070
Having Christmas at the inn?

31:47.106 --> 31:49.373
Well, yes, sometimes,

31:49.408 --> 31:52.509
but, you know, I also, um,
kind of miss it in a good way.

31:52.544 --> 31:54.244
You know?

31:54.280 --> 31:57.614
My dad always used to say

31:57.650 --> 32:00.017
that memories are the things
that we use

32:00.052 --> 32:03.020
to wrap ourselves up in
to keep us warm at night.

32:03.055 --> 32:04.288
And it's true.

32:04.323 --> 32:07.758
Even today,
no matter where I am...

32:07.793 --> 32:09.860
I always feel warm

32:09.895 --> 32:13.397
thinking about all
the special nights I spent here.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.065
Just like this one?

32:15.100 --> 32:17.567
Well, yeah, just like this one.

32:19.738 --> 32:22.205
[♪♪♪]

32:23.575 --> 32:24.608
Hot chocolate.

32:24.643 --> 32:25.776
Oh.

32:25.811 --> 32:27.911
Oh, great!

32:27.947 --> 32:29.947
Okay. I think we're ready.

32:32.017 --> 32:33.750
Now, I patched everything
into a remote control,

32:33.786 --> 32:35.252
so all you have to do
is hit the button.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.587
Oh, great. Thanks, garrett.

32:37.623 --> 32:39.589
All right.
Natalie, want to do the honors?

32:39.625 --> 32:41.224
Ooh. Yes, please.

32:41.260 --> 32:42.826
Ready? This button here.

32:42.861 --> 32:45.195
Three... Two... One.

32:46.265 --> 32:48.732
[♪♪♪]

32:50.869 --> 32:52.302
- [all gushing]
- beautiful!

32:52.338 --> 32:54.104
Wow!

32:54.139 --> 32:55.739
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
There's more, there's more.

32:55.774 --> 32:58.642
Turn around. Ready? And...

32:58.677 --> 32:59.943
Now.

33:01.180 --> 33:03.313
[♪♪♪]

33:03.349 --> 33:06.249
[overlapping] oh!

33:09.621 --> 33:12.122
Now, that's
what I call Christmas.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.664
[♪♪♪]

33:25.004 --> 33:26.603
It's looking pretty good
in here.

33:26.638 --> 33:28.305
Yeah. I mean,
there's still a lot to do,

33:28.340 --> 33:31.775
but I think we've made
remarkable progress in a week.

33:31.810 --> 33:33.977
How many trees did you get?

33:34.013 --> 33:36.013
Santa's village
is gonna be jealous.

33:36.048 --> 33:36.880
Hey, can you switch out

33:36.915 --> 33:38.315
those electrical outlets
I showed you?

33:38.350 --> 33:40.150
- Yeah. Sure.
- Great.

33:40.185 --> 33:41.818
Do you want to write it down?

33:41.854 --> 33:43.086
I got it.

33:43.122 --> 33:45.856
Garrett, we have a lot to do
and not a lot of time to do it.

33:45.891 --> 33:48.125
Three weeks. More or less.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.093
Right. I...

33:55.868 --> 33:57.200
[muttering] henry...?

33:57.236 --> 33:59.403
Where are you, henry?

33:59.438 --> 34:01.038
Oh. Hey, mark. What's going on?

34:01.073 --> 34:03.040
Oh, the hunt for henry
continues.

34:03.075 --> 34:04.508
Yes, natalie's reindeer.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.209
I heard. So no sightings, then?

34:06.245 --> 34:07.210
Afraid not.

34:07.246 --> 34:08.445
David's looking in the basement

34:08.480 --> 34:11.581
and I think natalie is upstairs,
searching the utility room.

34:11.617 --> 34:13.483
Well, I'm sure it'll turn up.

34:13.518 --> 34:15.085
[mark sighs]

34:15.120 --> 34:16.219
Any luck?

34:16.255 --> 34:18.221
I found this old winter coat
I lost three years ago,

34:18.257 --> 34:20.489
but... No henry.

34:20.525 --> 34:23.060
Natalie's gonna be heartbroken
if we don't find it.

34:23.094 --> 34:25.529
I know, I feel like
we've looked everywhere twice.

34:25.563 --> 34:28.065
I wish we could do something
to take her mind off of it.

34:28.100 --> 34:30.266
Willow, is there anything
that she can do for you?

34:30.302 --> 34:32.235
Why, yes, actually.

34:32.271 --> 34:33.402
Mrs. Hill from the stables

34:33.438 --> 34:35.338
is gonna be here any minute
with a horse and carriage.

34:35.373 --> 34:36.440
Horse and carriage?

34:36.475 --> 34:37.841
Yes, it's for the wedding.

34:37.876 --> 34:39.509
It's gonna bring Juni
from the inn

34:39.545 --> 34:41.210
down to the barn.

34:41.246 --> 34:42.946
Didn't you used to have
carriages here at Christmas?

34:42.981 --> 34:44.547
Yes!

34:44.583 --> 34:46.116
That was so much fun.

34:46.150 --> 34:48.885
David, you have to bring
them back.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.455
We already have every last bit
of Christmas

34:51.489 --> 34:52.255
on the outside of the inn, dad.

34:52.291 --> 34:53.889
Do we really
need carriage rides?

34:53.926 --> 34:56.193
Nobody needs carriage rides,

34:56.228 --> 34:58.895
but it's fun,
and everybody needs fun,

34:58.931 --> 35:00.130
especially at Christmas time.

35:00.165 --> 35:01.431
You should listen
to your father, david.

35:01.467 --> 35:02.399
He's a wise man.

35:02.434 --> 35:05.735
He is very wise,
but he's not paying for it.

35:05.771 --> 35:09.072
Well, it's part of the wedding,
so my family's paying for it.

35:10.275 --> 35:11.808
Okay, I mean...

35:11.844 --> 35:14.144
A horse would take
her mind off of this.

35:14.179 --> 35:16.713
What am I saying? A horse would
take her mind off of everything.

35:16.748 --> 35:17.781
Perfect.

35:17.816 --> 35:19.249
And you should come with us.

35:19.284 --> 35:20.584
And do not tell me
that you have to work.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.085
It's Saturday.

35:22.121 --> 35:23.687
You know, you're right.
You're right!

35:24.623 --> 35:26.690
I'll go get natalie.

35:28.961 --> 35:30.560
- [smack]
- [mark laughs]

35:31.964 --> 35:35.398
Oh, this is perfect.

35:35.434 --> 35:38.568
Your buyer's gonna take one look
at this, and the inn,

35:38.604 --> 35:40.303
and he's just gonna whip out
his checkbook on the spot.

35:40.339 --> 35:41.972
I don't know about that.

35:42.007 --> 35:44.007
Dad. I'm petting the horse!

35:44.042 --> 35:44.941
I see that.

35:44.977 --> 35:47.310
And his name is frosty,
like the snowman.

35:47.346 --> 35:48.411
Oh, that's a great name.

35:48.447 --> 35:50.080
And Mrs. Hill,

35:50.115 --> 35:51.815
she said we can go for a ride.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.517
- Oh.
- Oh.

35:53.552 --> 35:54.384
Actually, I don't know

35:54.419 --> 35:55.919
if we have time
to do that, sweetie.

35:55.954 --> 35:58.255
But dad,
the carriage is right here,

35:58.290 --> 36:01.491
and frosty's all ready to go.

36:01.527 --> 36:03.360
I think he wants
to give us a ride.

36:03.395 --> 36:04.227
[giggles]

36:04.263 --> 36:06.763
Well, I mean,
if frosty wants to...

36:06.798 --> 36:09.799
Well, how can we say "no"
to frosty?

36:09.835 --> 36:10.834
Yay!

36:10.869 --> 36:12.769
[natalie laughing]

36:14.907 --> 36:16.606
She's really having fun.

36:16.642 --> 36:18.375
Yes, she is,

36:18.410 --> 36:20.877
and I have you to thank
for that, so...

36:20.913 --> 36:22.112
Thank you.

36:22.147 --> 36:24.481
Well, gotta say,
it hasn't been easy.

36:24.516 --> 36:27.450
The guy who owns the inn
has been pretty resistant

36:27.486 --> 36:28.785
to everything I wanted to do.

36:28.820 --> 36:29.819
[laughs]

36:29.855 --> 36:31.354
Listen.

36:31.390 --> 36:33.823
We do celebrate, you know.

36:33.859 --> 36:35.792
We do lights, the presents,
and everything,

36:35.827 --> 36:38.195
it's just that we haven't done
a really big Christmas

36:38.230 --> 36:39.262
in a few years.

36:39.298 --> 36:42.232
I-I know that you haven't,
and I understand why,

36:42.267 --> 36:44.067
and I hope you don't think
that I don't...

36:44.102 --> 36:45.068
No, no, no.
It's okay, it's okay.

36:45.103 --> 36:48.171
In fact, it's more than okay.

36:50.609 --> 36:53.210
It's time we did
a really big Christmas.

36:55.180 --> 36:57.314
[♪♪♪]

36:58.850 --> 37:00.383
So,

37:00.419 --> 37:02.085
um, what was

37:02.120 --> 37:04.821
your absolute favorite
Christmas?

37:04.856 --> 37:07.157
Oh... Wow. Uh...

37:07.192 --> 37:08.825
Okay.

37:08.860 --> 37:12.562
Well, the one
that's popping into my mind

37:12.598 --> 37:14.364
has got to be
when I was six years old.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.399
I remember
I had gotten it into my head

37:16.435 --> 37:18.034
that I was gonna stay up
all night

37:18.070 --> 37:20.237
so I could meet santa when
he came to bring the presents

37:20.272 --> 37:23.940
because I just
wanted to thank him.

37:23.976 --> 37:24.975
You know?

37:25.010 --> 37:26.876
For all the gifts he had
brought me in the past,

37:26.912 --> 37:29.512
and I just wanted to see him
eat a Christmas cookie.

37:29.548 --> 37:31.114
Makes sense.

37:31.149 --> 37:32.582
How late did you stay up?

37:32.618 --> 37:34.351
I was asleep by 9:45.

37:34.386 --> 37:36.152
Okay.

37:37.256 --> 37:39.556
It was a good Christmas.

37:39.591 --> 37:40.857
How about you?

37:40.892 --> 37:42.926
Um...

37:43.895 --> 37:47.564
Well, probably the Christmas
when I was 14.

37:47.599 --> 37:48.798
Yeah.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.133
Well, we didn't know

37:50.168 --> 37:53.270
it was gonna be our last one
here with my dad,

37:53.305 --> 37:54.571
but it was.

37:54.606 --> 37:57.807
I just remember it
because he was so happy.

37:57.843 --> 37:59.909
You know?

37:59.945 --> 38:02.646
Christmas was just
his favorite time of the year,

38:02.681 --> 38:04.581
and we had a bunch
of friends and family

38:04.616 --> 38:05.882
come and stay with us...

38:05.917 --> 38:08.251
Yeah.

38:08.287 --> 38:12.822
He just... he knew how to make it
really special for us, you know?

38:12.858 --> 38:14.958
That's nice.

38:18.263 --> 38:19.462
Hey, natalie?

38:19.498 --> 38:20.897
What do you say we do

38:20.932 --> 38:22.799
carriage rides at the inn
this Christmas?

38:22.834 --> 38:25.468
Yay! Did you hear that frosty?

38:25.504 --> 38:27.003
[giggling]

38:27.039 --> 38:27.971
Come on!

38:28.006 --> 38:29.139
We need to take a picture.

38:29.174 --> 38:30.674
Oh, I'll take it.

38:30.709 --> 38:32.309
You have to be in it.

38:32.344 --> 38:34.144
Yeah, no, you need to be in it.

38:34.179 --> 38:35.011
I don't mind.

38:35.047 --> 38:35.845
No, no. You know what?

38:35.881 --> 38:36.980
You do have to be in it.
She's right.

38:37.015 --> 38:39.616
Sorry, Mrs. Hill, do you mind
taking a photo of us?

38:43.989 --> 38:45.922
Thank you.

38:45.957 --> 38:48.758
Three... Two... One...

38:48.794 --> 38:51.027
Carrots!

38:51.063 --> 38:52.595
[laughing]

38:55.467 --> 38:56.766
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:56.802 --> 38:57.867
I'm heading home.

38:57.903 --> 38:59.936
Okay. Thank you for everything.

38:59.971 --> 39:01.271
Where's natalie?

39:01.306 --> 39:03.340
She's in the bath.

39:03.375 --> 39:06.443
She was very excited
about that horse.

39:06.478 --> 39:07.477
Yeah. I have a feeling

39:07.512 --> 39:09.346
she's gonna want to update
her Christmas list.

39:09.381 --> 39:11.448
I have a feeling you're right.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.616
Sounds like you all had
a good time, though.

39:13.652 --> 39:14.951
Yeah, we did.

39:14.986 --> 39:17.354
I mean, Willow sure knows
how to do Christmas.

39:17.389 --> 39:19.055
Yes, she does.

39:19.091 --> 39:20.123
She's such a sweetheart.

39:20.158 --> 39:21.424
Yeah.

39:22.527 --> 39:25.028
[♪♪♪]

39:38.610 --> 39:41.211
[footsteps]

39:45.016 --> 39:46.316
[gasps] oh.

39:46.351 --> 39:48.017
[both chuckling]

39:48.053 --> 39:50.587
I am going to look spectacular

39:50.622 --> 39:52.222
arriving at my wedding
in that carriage.

39:52.257 --> 39:54.224
Yes. Yes, you are.

39:54.259 --> 39:55.658
And it's one more thing

39:55.694 --> 39:57.360
to cross off
my wedding to-do list.

39:58.563 --> 39:59.729
I'm sorry, what?

39:59.765 --> 40:03.166
You had a horse and carriage
on your wedding to-do list?

40:03.201 --> 40:04.401
[embarrassed chuckle]

40:04.436 --> 40:05.602
It's a very long list

40:05.637 --> 40:07.404
that I was never
going to get through,

40:07.439 --> 40:09.672
so let's just pretend
it was, okay?

40:09.708 --> 40:12.008
Sure. Wedding planning is fun.

40:12.043 --> 40:14.344
Oh, yeah.
I'm not stressed out at all.

40:14.379 --> 40:15.578
Right.

40:15.614 --> 40:17.747
I'm glad that you're getting
the two of them out to have fun.

40:17.783 --> 40:19.215
Austin has been so worried

40:19.251 --> 40:21.184
that david was spending
too much time working.

40:21.219 --> 40:24.421
Well, he's probably right,
but I'm trying.

40:24.456 --> 40:26.456
And you're doing a great job...

40:26.491 --> 40:28.391
On the inn, the wedding,
Christmas...

40:28.427 --> 40:29.325
Everything.

40:29.361 --> 40:31.928
Have I told you
how much I appreciate it?

40:31.963 --> 40:34.431
Several times, yes.

40:34.466 --> 40:37.400
But, really, I'm...
I'm enjoying it.

40:37.436 --> 40:39.536
I'm glad.

40:42.073 --> 40:43.173
But...?

40:44.910 --> 40:46.376
I just want to make sure

40:46.411 --> 40:48.311
that you're not getting
too emotionally invested.

40:48.346 --> 40:51.414
No. Why would you, uh,
why would you say that?

40:51.450 --> 40:54.083
I just... I know how much
the inn means to you.

40:54.119 --> 40:55.919
Right, the inn.

40:55.954 --> 40:57.587
Yeah, and I remember
how hard it was

40:57.622 --> 40:58.988
for us to leave it
when we were kids.

40:59.024 --> 41:01.224
Mm-hmm.

41:01.259 --> 41:03.393
I don't want you to feel badly
when Christmas is over

41:03.428 --> 41:05.094
and you have to go
back to New York.

41:05.130 --> 41:06.729
You're leaving a lot behind.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.299
Don't worry, Juni.

41:09.334 --> 41:10.467
I'll be careful.

41:10.502 --> 41:11.968
Thank you, Juni.

41:12.003 --> 41:13.002
Of course.

41:13.038 --> 41:14.737
Take care of yourself.

41:14.773 --> 41:15.872
Will do.

41:17.142 --> 41:19.108
- Love you.
- Love you.

41:23.648 --> 41:25.148
See you tonight
at the tree lighting.

41:37.128 --> 41:38.862
Where are dad and grandpa?

41:38.897 --> 41:40.530
Grandpa had
a quick errand to run,

41:40.565 --> 41:41.931
and your dad got held up
at work,

41:41.967 --> 41:43.600
but they are on their way.

41:43.635 --> 41:45.435
They're gonna miss the tree.

41:45.470 --> 41:47.704
I'm sure
they're gonna make it on time.

41:47.739 --> 41:48.938
Don't you worry.

41:48.974 --> 41:51.541
Why don't I get us
some hot apple cider

41:51.576 --> 41:52.775
to keep us warm?

41:52.811 --> 41:54.711
- Yeah!
- I'll help.

41:54.746 --> 41:56.412
Willow, will you stay here
with natalie?

41:56.448 --> 41:58.281
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

42:02.120 --> 42:05.221
So... Are you excited
for the lights?

42:05.257 --> 42:06.756
Yeah.

42:06.791 --> 42:09.559
But it's gonna have to be
pretty special

42:09.594 --> 42:12.228
to be better than
what we have at the inn.

42:12.264 --> 42:13.596
Mm...

42:13.632 --> 42:15.598
I don't know, I think
they're gonna top us.

42:15.634 --> 42:16.666
[natalie giggles]

42:16.701 --> 42:17.834
You know, lighting the tree

42:17.869 --> 42:19.502
is kind of the town's way
of saying

42:19.538 --> 42:22.438
it's officially Christmas.

42:22.474 --> 42:25.608
Well, I think it should be
Christmas all the time.

42:25.644 --> 42:27.176
Really?

42:27.212 --> 42:30.346
See, I kind of think that having
Christmas only once a year

42:30.382 --> 42:31.814
is kind of
what makes it special.

42:31.850 --> 42:33.249
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

42:33.285 --> 42:34.584
How so?

42:34.619 --> 42:37.186
Well, think about
all of the things

42:37.222 --> 42:39.155
that you look forward
to at Christmastime.

42:39.190 --> 42:41.991
The carols, the decorations...

42:42.027 --> 42:43.293
And the cookies.

42:43.328 --> 42:45.461
Yes, exactly, the cookies.

42:45.497 --> 42:47.163
You wait all year,

42:47.198 --> 42:49.365
and you think about having
that Christmas cookie,

42:49.401 --> 42:51.534
and then when
you finally get one,

42:51.570 --> 42:52.602
it's so delicious, right?

42:52.637 --> 42:55.705
It's like all that waiting
has finally paid off.

42:55.740 --> 42:58.808
Yes, exactly.
It's like it's a reward.

42:58.843 --> 43:00.376
Because, if you had
Christmas cookies

43:00.412 --> 43:02.111
every day of every week
of the year,

43:02.147 --> 43:03.546
it just it wouldn't
feel as special.

43:03.582 --> 43:06.349
Hmm. I haven't thought of it
that way.

43:07.519 --> 43:09.986
[sighs] okay.

43:10.021 --> 43:12.221
Now I really want
to bake Christmas cookies.

43:12.257 --> 43:14.190
Me too!

43:14.225 --> 43:15.091
[deep breath] hmm.

43:15.126 --> 43:17.627
So, tell me, what else
about Christmas

43:17.662 --> 43:19.362
do you think
is worth waiting for?

43:19.397 --> 43:21.297
Hmm... Everything.

43:21.333 --> 43:22.465
[laughs]

43:22.500 --> 43:24.400
We have dinner at my grandma's,

43:24.436 --> 43:27.236
and then we call
my other grandparents,

43:27.272 --> 43:28.638
my grandma and grandpa,

43:28.673 --> 43:31.140
on the computer,

43:31.176 --> 43:34.010
and we always have
Christmas morning at the inn.

43:35.413 --> 43:37.046
I mean... [sighs]

43:37.082 --> 43:41.184
I guess we won't have that
anymore after this year.

43:41.219 --> 43:43.386
Well, that's okay.

43:43.421 --> 43:45.555
It doesn't really matter
where you are,

43:45.590 --> 43:48.057
it only matters that you're with
the people that you love.

43:50.061 --> 43:52.195
[♪♪♪]

43:52.230 --> 43:54.197
Ah, there's Juni and austin.
Let's go say hi.

43:54.232 --> 43:56.566
- Yeah.
- Okay. Hey!

43:56.601 --> 43:58.368
- Hey!
- Hey.

43:58.403 --> 43:59.869
Hey, it's almost time
to light the tree.

43:59.904 --> 44:03.439
Let's do it. Yeah.

44:03.475 --> 44:05.208
So the tie was the errand, huh?

44:05.243 --> 44:06.309
I have chosen to believe

44:06.344 --> 44:09.112
that your mother finds
this kind of thing charming.

44:09.147 --> 44:11.948
Well, you've been married
40-something years,

44:11.983 --> 44:14.884
so it's gotta be
doing something right.

44:14.919 --> 44:16.519
Takes practice.

44:16.554 --> 44:17.720
And patience.

44:17.756 --> 44:19.188
A lot of patience.

44:19.224 --> 44:21.357
I remember.

44:21.393 --> 44:23.960
So you're gonna have
a full house at the inn soon.

44:23.995 --> 44:26.262
Yeah, I mean,
we have austin's family

44:26.297 --> 44:27.764
staying over the holidays.

44:27.799 --> 44:29.732
Juni's friends
are gonna be there.

44:29.768 --> 44:32.735
That should be the most people
we've had there in a long time.

44:32.771 --> 44:35.705
You know, you could've had
that place full all the time,

44:35.740 --> 44:37.540
if you just did
a little more advertising.

44:37.575 --> 44:39.375
It's like you were
trying to keep it secret.

44:39.411 --> 44:41.144
No, it's like
I was too busy, dad.

44:41.179 --> 44:43.880
Too busy? That all it was?

44:45.250 --> 44:47.583
I just...

44:47.619 --> 44:49.919
I didn't really know
how to do it by myself.

44:49.954 --> 44:51.888
And I got to admit,

44:51.923 --> 44:54.390
seeing the inn come back to life
has been great,

44:54.426 --> 44:56.292
but I know I have to move on.

44:56.327 --> 44:58.428
Well, you did an amazing job
with it.

44:59.964 --> 45:01.831
It's mostly Willow.

45:01.866 --> 45:03.733
Gonna find it tough
to say goodbye?

45:05.003 --> 45:06.302
Oh, to the inn?

45:06.337 --> 45:08.538
Yeah, no, it'll be tough.

45:09.541 --> 45:11.708
Well, it's never too late
to change your mind.

45:13.311 --> 45:14.610
Dad! You made it!

45:14.646 --> 45:15.678
[david laughs]

45:15.714 --> 45:17.380
I wouldn't miss it, kiddo.

45:20.618 --> 45:22.919
Grandpa, your tie.

45:22.954 --> 45:25.354
Grandma, isn't it great?

45:25.390 --> 45:29.692
I think
it's absolutely... Charming.

45:29.728 --> 45:31.461
<i>Welcome, everyone.</i>

45:31.496 --> 45:33.963
<i>It's time to light the tree!</i>

45:33.998 --> 45:35.098
Is everybody ready?

45:35.133 --> 45:36.132
<i>Please welcome our special...</i>

45:36.167 --> 45:38.501
Okay, the button's over there.
You go push it!

45:38.536 --> 45:39.535
<i>Natalie!</i>

45:39.571 --> 45:41.170
[crowd] ...Six! Five!

45:41.206 --> 45:43.139
Four! Three!

45:43.174 --> 45:45.007
Two! One!

45:46.077 --> 45:47.610
Wow!

45:50.215 --> 45:52.315
Merry Christmas, everyone!

45:52.350 --> 45:54.016
[crowd cheering]

45:55.987 --> 45:57.120
Merry Christmas!

45:57.155 --> 45:59.455
[♪♪♪]

46:08.867 --> 46:10.032
Cheers.

46:20.044 --> 46:22.378
All right, kiddo. Bedtime.

46:23.615 --> 46:26.082
But maybe a bedtime story first?

46:26.117 --> 46:27.950
We just read three.

46:29.254 --> 46:31.888
[sighs] but... Just one more?

46:31.923 --> 46:33.689
A short one, a Christmas one.

46:33.725 --> 46:34.724
[david sighs]

46:34.759 --> 46:37.593
Hey. I found my notebook.
It was in the kitchen.

46:37.629 --> 46:39.996
Oh, great. Goodnight.

46:40.031 --> 46:41.364
Goodnight, you two.

46:41.399 --> 46:43.833
Oh! Willow can read me
a bedtime story.

46:43.868 --> 46:45.868
Um...

46:45.904 --> 46:48.938
Well, I... Okay with me,
if it's okay with Willow.

46:48.973 --> 46:50.773
Yeah, of course, it's okay.

46:50.809 --> 46:52.542
Lucky!

46:52.577 --> 46:54.043
[giggles]

46:55.647 --> 46:59.048
All right... What have we here?

46:59.083 --> 47:01.083
Oh. Oh, well, here's one.

47:02.420 --> 47:03.719
All right.

47:03.755 --> 47:05.955
Let's see here.

47:05.990 --> 47:07.723
Okay.

47:07.759 --> 47:09.592
<i>A visit from st. Nicholas.</i>

47:09.627 --> 47:11.694
You know, my dad used to read
this to me and my sister, Juni,

47:11.729 --> 47:13.262
all the time.

47:13.298 --> 47:14.964
This and <i> a Christmas carol.</i>

47:14.999 --> 47:18.568
Ooh! Dad says I get to read
<i>a Christmas carol</i> next year.

47:18.603 --> 47:21.804
Mm, and that will definitely
be something to look forward to.

47:21.840 --> 47:22.672
Mm-hmm.

47:24.309 --> 47:25.908
"'Twas the night
before Christmas,"

47:25.944 --> 47:27.476
when all through the house,

47:27.512 --> 47:30.046
"not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse."

47:30.081 --> 47:31.147
well, that's good,

47:31.182 --> 47:34.417
because we definitely
don't want mice in the inn.

47:34.452 --> 47:35.885
No, we do not.

47:35.920 --> 47:39.322
"The stockings were hung
by the chimney with care,"

47:39.357 --> 47:43.492
in hopes that st. Nicholas
soon would be there.

47:43.528 --> 47:46.429
The children were nestled
all snug in their beds,

47:46.464 --> 47:49.065
"while visions of sugarplums
danced in their heads."

47:49.100 --> 47:50.933
[door shuts]

47:50.969 --> 47:53.102
All right.

47:53.137 --> 47:55.605
She finally fell asleep.

47:55.640 --> 47:57.740
Oh, thank you.

47:57.775 --> 47:59.275
You know, she doesn't let
just anyone

47:59.310 --> 48:00.910
read her a bedtime story.

48:00.945 --> 48:04.080
Oh, well, in that case,
I'm especially honored.

48:04.115 --> 48:05.948
And I appreciate it.

48:05.984 --> 48:07.617
Also, thank you for suggesting

48:07.652 --> 48:09.485
we go
to the tree lighting tonight.

48:09.520 --> 48:10.453
It was a lot of fun.

48:10.488 --> 48:11.587
It really was.

48:11.623 --> 48:12.588
Yeah.

48:12.624 --> 48:16.826
So... Two weeks to go.
Are we gonna make it?

48:16.861 --> 48:18.861
Uh, I think so.

48:18.897 --> 48:20.263
I hope so.

48:20.298 --> 48:21.264
Wait.

48:21.299 --> 48:23.799
Ms. Don't-worry-about-anything
only "hopes" so?

48:23.835 --> 48:26.435
Okay, now I'm gonna
worry about everything.

48:26.471 --> 48:28.104
Well, then, see?
We'll balance each other out.

48:28.139 --> 48:29.939
Maybe so.

48:29.974 --> 48:32.308
Mm.

48:32.343 --> 48:33.542
Hey, look.

48:33.578 --> 48:36.445
I have to admit
that this is shaping up

48:36.481 --> 48:38.681
to be
a rather spectacular Christmas,

48:38.716 --> 48:40.716
and I know that I was
kind of hesitant.

48:40.752 --> 48:42.718
- A little.
- Yeah.

48:42.754 --> 48:44.687
But it's really
working out well,

48:44.722 --> 48:45.855
and I just want to say

48:45.890 --> 48:48.791
that I've really enjoyed
spending so much time with you.

48:50.261 --> 48:52.228
Working on the inn.

48:52.263 --> 48:53.496
You too.

48:53.531 --> 48:54.997
The inn.

48:55.033 --> 48:57.066
- The inn, yeah.
- Yeah.

48:57.101 --> 48:59.802
Yeah, I hope that your buyer
is impressed

48:59.837 --> 49:03.839
and that, uh, you can just
sell it quickly

49:03.875 --> 49:05.074
and just move right along.

49:05.109 --> 49:07.543
Right, yeah, and you can...

49:07.578 --> 49:10.012
Get back to your regular life.

49:10.048 --> 49:11.580
Anyway...

49:11.616 --> 49:12.882
- Oh, I'll get your jacket.
- Oh, thank you.

49:15.920 --> 49:16.986
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

49:19.557 --> 49:21.524
- Yeah.
- There we go.

49:21.559 --> 49:23.159
So, uh, I'm just curious.

49:23.194 --> 49:25.428
Like, if you didn't come back
here for Christmas,

49:25.463 --> 49:27.029
what would you have been doing?

49:27.065 --> 49:29.065
Oh, well, first of all,

49:29.100 --> 49:31.567
I probably would've come in
the night before Christmas

49:31.602 --> 49:33.336
and left the day
right after Christmas.

49:33.371 --> 49:37.440
I never get to spend
this much time here, but, um...

49:37.475 --> 49:40.242
I am really glad that I did.

49:40.278 --> 49:41.811
You ever
think about moving back?

49:42.981 --> 49:46.949
I'd consider it, you know,
if the right reason popped up.

49:46.985 --> 49:48.751
What would be the right reason?

49:50.121 --> 49:52.254
I think
I'd know it when I see it.

49:53.658 --> 49:54.590
Right.

49:55.793 --> 49:57.927
Anyway, it's late, I should...

50:01.632 --> 50:03.032
Okay. Goodnight.

50:03.067 --> 50:05.101
- Bye.
- Bye.

50:14.178 --> 50:16.312
Welcome, everyone! Hello!

50:16.347 --> 50:17.713
Welcome to brogan's diner

50:17.749 --> 50:20.116
and our annual
holiday celebration.

50:20.151 --> 50:22.284
[cheering]

50:22.320 --> 50:23.819
[applauding]

50:23.855 --> 50:27.556
We really do appreciate
each of you so much.

50:27.592 --> 50:29.692
Now, who's ready to play
some Christmas games?

50:29.727 --> 50:30.926
[cheering]

50:32.864 --> 50:34.196
Christmas games?

50:34.232 --> 50:36.732
She takes Christmas
very seriously.

50:36.768 --> 50:39.368
Now I see where you get it from.

50:39.404 --> 50:41.003
Inside these boxes
are Christmas bells.

50:41.039 --> 50:42.805
Teams of two will try
to be the first ones

50:42.840 --> 50:45.007
to unwrap the box
and ring the bell.

50:45.043 --> 50:47.676
The catch is...

50:47.712 --> 50:50.179
Your hands are gonna
be tied together,

50:50.214 --> 50:52.214
and the other hand has to be
behind your back.

50:52.250 --> 50:53.249
No cheating.

50:53.284 --> 50:55.985
The first team to unwrap the box
and ring the bell

50:56.020 --> 50:57.019
wins...

50:57.055 --> 50:59.688
Free pie for a week.

50:59.724 --> 51:00.823
Okay?

51:00.858 --> 51:03.225
Everybody, assemble your teams.

51:03.261 --> 51:05.194
Nat, you wanna be partners?

51:05.229 --> 51:06.695
- Of course.
- Yes!

[natalie giggles]

51:08.032 --> 51:11.000
Hmm. Willow, david...
You're a team.

51:11.035 --> 51:12.935
- Oh!
- We... We are?

51:12.970 --> 51:15.404
Okay, um, I don't remember
raising my hand.

51:15.440 --> 51:17.073
My game, my rules.

51:17.108 --> 51:19.008
- I guess we should...
- Yes.

51:19.043 --> 51:21.410
[♪♪♪]

51:23.915 --> 51:25.347
All right...

51:25.383 --> 51:26.348
Hands, please?

51:26.384 --> 51:27.683
Um...

51:27.718 --> 51:28.717
- Yes.
- Okay.

51:28.753 --> 51:30.152
Like that.

51:31.456 --> 51:33.689
- This is so much fun!
- Are you ready?

51:33.724 --> 51:35.124
Other hand behind our backs,
is that right?

51:35.159 --> 51:36.058
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

51:38.129 --> 51:39.095
- Ready?
- Ready.

51:39.130 --> 51:40.296
Set?

51:40.331 --> 51:41.597
Go-ho-ho!

51:47.505 --> 51:49.138
There, we got that part off.

51:49.173 --> 51:52.808
Here we go! Ribbon off!

51:52.844 --> 51:54.210
Grab the... grab the corner.

51:54.245 --> 51:55.010
You gotta try.

51:55.046 --> 51:57.246
I am trying!
You gotta pull on...

51:57.281 --> 51:59.181
What? Oh...

52:00.351 --> 52:03.219
It's a lot more difficult
than it seems...

[jingling]

52:06.290 --> 52:08.090
[all cheering]

52:08.126 --> 52:10.593
Yay!

52:10.628 --> 52:12.328
Natalie and austin win!

52:12.363 --> 52:14.497
Oh, thank you so much!

52:14.532 --> 52:15.998

52:23.274 --> 52:24.840
Look at this place!

52:24.876 --> 52:26.242
I know.

52:26.277 --> 52:28.077
Can you imagine
how beautiful it would look

52:28.112 --> 52:29.345
if you had just let me paint?

52:29.380 --> 52:31.280
[laughs] I just love
seeing it like this.

52:31.315 --> 52:32.915
Full of life and energy.

52:32.950 --> 52:34.750
It just reminds me
of when we first bought it.

52:34.785 --> 52:36.418
David?

52:38.189 --> 52:39.922
Are you sure
about selling the inn?

52:41.058 --> 52:42.591
I am.

52:42.627 --> 52:45.794
I mean, I see it like this,
and it's tempting, you know?

52:45.830 --> 52:48.497
To just chuck the nine-to-five
and the suit,

52:48.533 --> 52:50.099
and go run an inn.

52:50.134 --> 52:51.634
But...

52:51.669 --> 52:54.503
I didn't work as hard
as I worked to become partner

52:54.539 --> 52:57.306
just to give up
when I'm so close to it.

52:57.341 --> 52:58.474
You know?

52:58.509 --> 53:00.442
Right.

53:00.478 --> 53:02.211
What did you call it?

53:02.246 --> 53:04.013
Um...

53:04.048 --> 53:05.948
"getting back on track."

53:05.983 --> 53:08.684
that's right. That's...
Something like that, yeah.

53:08.719 --> 53:10.853
Still, though, it's a...

53:10.888 --> 53:12.688
It's a nice dream, isn't it?

53:13.991 --> 53:15.257
It is.

53:16.327 --> 53:17.426
Hey, david!

53:18.930 --> 53:20.829
Yeah?

53:20.865 --> 53:22.665
Um, best man duty calls.

53:22.700 --> 53:23.666
Right.

53:26.737 --> 53:29.004

53:38.950 --> 53:41.016

53:42.954 --> 53:44.653
[Willow] pink icing...
Is that all right?

53:44.689 --> 53:46.488
Pink is good.

53:46.524 --> 53:47.590
Yeah.

53:47.625 --> 53:50.659
You really should put
more sprinkles on that one.

53:50.695 --> 53:52.361
Oh, I think maybe
<i>you</i> need more sprinkles!

53:52.396 --> 53:54.196
[laughing]

53:54.232 --> 53:55.998
What's going on here?

53:56.033 --> 53:57.933
We're making Christmas cookies.

53:57.969 --> 54:00.236
Yeah, I see that,
and they smell wonderful.

54:00.271 --> 54:02.238
Well, let me get you one, then.

54:02.273 --> 54:03.339
Oh, please.

54:03.374 --> 54:05.941
I found natalie out in the barn
looking for henry,

54:05.977 --> 54:07.743
so I thought
maybe we should take

54:07.778 --> 54:08.944
a little Christmas spirit break.

54:08.980 --> 54:10.279
[quietly] thank you.

54:10.314 --> 54:11.880
Oh!

54:11.916 --> 54:13.782
Thank you.

54:13.818 --> 54:15.084
Oh, sorry.

54:15.119 --> 54:18.187
Mm. This is delicious.

54:18.222 --> 54:20.289
Totally worth the wait.
Right, Willow?

54:20.324 --> 54:22.891
Oh, yeah.

54:22.927 --> 54:25.361
So, natalie did you wish
for anything special this year

54:25.396 --> 54:26.395
from santa?

54:26.430 --> 54:27.363
I did.

54:27.398 --> 54:30.132
But I can't tell you
or it won't come true.

54:30.167 --> 54:31.233
Oh.

54:31.269 --> 54:32.534
It didn't have to do

54:32.570 --> 54:34.436
with a certain horse
named frosty, did it?

54:34.472 --> 54:35.971
No.

54:36.007 --> 54:37.306
Willow explained to me

54:37.341 --> 54:39.208
that frosty needs to stay
with Mrs. Hill.

54:39.243 --> 54:40.409
[mouths words]

54:42.146 --> 54:43.412
So, what did you wish for?

54:43.447 --> 54:45.381
Me? Um...

54:45.416 --> 54:47.316
Uh...

54:47.351 --> 54:49.418
Well, like you said,

54:49.453 --> 54:51.920
if I tell you,
then it won't come true.

54:51.956 --> 54:54.556
Not even a hint?

54:54.592 --> 54:56.158
I'll tell you what.

54:56.193 --> 54:59.762
I will trade you
one cookie for one hint.

55:00.931 --> 55:02.398
These cookies are really good.

55:02.433 --> 55:05.267
They're worth
at least two hints.

55:05.303 --> 55:06.969
- Mm-hmm.
- Really?

55:07.004 --> 55:08.771
Well, then,

55:08.806 --> 55:10.506
maybe I'll just...

55:10.541 --> 55:11.607
Tickle you!

55:11.642 --> 55:13.976
[laughing loudly]

55:17.982 --> 55:19.815
Oh, I'm going to steal it.

55:19.850 --> 55:21.417
[laughing and squealing]

55:24.121 --> 55:26.021
Thanks for the ride.

55:26.057 --> 55:27.256
Oh...

55:27.291 --> 55:28.624
Robert?

55:28.659 --> 55:30.125
- Hey.
- I didn't know you were here.

55:30.161 --> 55:32.261
Oh, no,
I didn't want to bother you,

55:32.296 --> 55:34.330
I just wanted to look around
a little bit on my own.

55:34.365 --> 55:35.798
I love what you've done here.

55:35.833 --> 55:38.200
I mean, the carriage rides?
A very nice touch.

55:38.235 --> 55:40.102
Oh, thanks, yeah,
it's turning out great.

55:40.137 --> 55:41.637
But, listen, the wedding's not
for another week,

55:41.672 --> 55:42.805
so it's not quite finished.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.106
You're coming to that, right?

55:44.141 --> 55:45.974
'Cause I want you to see
the inn in action

55:46.010 --> 55:47.109
with a big event.

55:47.144 --> 55:49.011
Sure, I'll be there, but, uh...

55:49.046 --> 55:51.180
You know,
I really don't need to.

55:51.215 --> 55:52.614
I'm ready.

55:52.650 --> 55:54.116
Good!

55:54.151 --> 55:55.584
Ready...?

55:56.821 --> 55:58.687
- To buy the inn?
- Yes! [Laughs]

55:58.723 --> 56:00.055
First thing Monday,

56:00.091 --> 56:01.357
I'm gonna have
my realtor call yours.

56:01.392 --> 56:02.291
We're gonna make you an offer.

56:02.326 --> 56:03.992
That's terrific!

56:04.028 --> 56:07.296
I-I...
I don't even know what to say.

56:07.331 --> 56:08.464
Well, you can start
by saying where

56:08.499 --> 56:09.465
you got that Christmas cookie.

56:09.500 --> 56:10.499
It smells delicious.

56:10.534 --> 56:12.201
They're in the kitchen.
You go help yourself.

56:12.236 --> 56:14.036
I'll be right there. I'm...

56:14.071 --> 56:15.671
Oh, wait! Hey!

56:15.706 --> 56:17.806
Let's just keep this news
between you and I for now,

56:17.842 --> 56:19.141
until it's a done deal, okay?

56:19.176 --> 56:20.342
No problem.

56:20.378 --> 56:22.177
- Terrific!
- All right.

56:22.213 --> 56:24.646
[♪♪♪]

56:31.989 --> 56:35.090
[♪♪♪]

56:35.126 --> 56:37.593
You still haven't
told anybody else?

56:37.628 --> 56:38.927
Well, I haven't seen the offer.

56:38.963 --> 56:40.863
I still don't know
if I'm gonna accept it.

56:40.898 --> 56:42.598
Why wouldn't you accept it?

56:42.633 --> 56:44.867
Are you having second thoughts?

56:44.902 --> 56:46.602
No, I'm just having...

56:46.637 --> 56:48.103
New thoughts.

56:48.139 --> 56:49.338
I don't understand.

56:49.373 --> 56:50.305
Neither do I, really.

56:50.341 --> 56:52.674
All I know is that
I'm starting to realize

56:52.710 --> 56:55.477
that the inn is maybe a little
more important than I thought.

56:55.513 --> 56:57.479
Is this about Willow?

56:57.515 --> 56:58.947
No.

56:58.983 --> 57:00.716
[chuckles]

57:00.751 --> 57:02.785
I'm a mother, I pay attention.

57:02.820 --> 57:04.453
It's complicated.

57:04.488 --> 57:06.555
That doesn't answer my question.

57:06.590 --> 57:09.458
What do you want, david?

57:09.493 --> 57:12.961
It's not about Willow or me
or what either of us wants.

57:12.997 --> 57:15.964
It's not about selling the inn
or making partner.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.866
I have a little girl
who is counting on me

57:17.902 --> 57:20.302
and the decision I make
is gonna affect her entire life.

57:20.337 --> 57:21.470
So...

57:21.505 --> 57:24.807
As long as you're not putting
any pressure on yourself.

57:24.842 --> 57:26.575
[both chuckling]

57:26.610 --> 57:29.745
You're a wonderful father,
david.

57:29.780 --> 57:32.347
When you need
to make the decision,

57:32.383 --> 57:34.249
you'll know what to do.

57:34.285 --> 57:35.751
Thanks, mom.

57:35.786 --> 57:37.553
Come on.

57:39.423 --> 57:43.158
No, no, no. It's no problem.
Truly, call any time.

57:43.194 --> 57:45.994
Thank you
for you holding down the fort.

57:46.030 --> 57:48.096
Merry Christmas.

57:48.132 --> 57:49.498
Problems?

57:49.533 --> 57:51.333
Just work stuff.

57:51.368 --> 57:53.101
You're supposed to be
on vacation.

57:53.137 --> 57:54.503
I think that they are regretting

57:54.538 --> 57:56.438
letting me leave
for quite this long.

57:56.474 --> 57:57.606
Of course they are.

57:57.641 --> 57:59.608
You're so good
at handling things.

57:59.643 --> 58:01.510
Your job, your sister's wedding,

58:01.545 --> 58:03.445
the inn.

58:03.481 --> 58:04.913
That's different.
It's a labor of love.

58:04.949 --> 58:05.948
Oh, you don't love your job?

58:05.983 --> 58:08.250
Well, I do. It's different.

58:08.285 --> 58:10.352
This is all for Juni.

58:10.387 --> 58:13.956
And the-the inn
is just special, you know?

58:13.991 --> 58:16.358
I will agree with you there.

58:16.393 --> 58:19.528
And I think
whoever buys the place

58:19.563 --> 58:21.897
is gonna be very lucky
that you were there.

58:21.932 --> 58:24.366
And the right savvy investor

58:24.401 --> 58:25.634
could really
make a real go of it.

58:25.669 --> 58:27.402
I agree.

58:27.438 --> 58:30.572
Someone with a background
in hotel management,

58:30.608 --> 58:32.441
so they really knew
what they're doing.

58:32.476 --> 58:35.210
Someone <i> emotionally invested</i>
in the place...

58:35.246 --> 58:37.045
Way to be subtle, mom.

58:37.081 --> 58:38.280
It's a week away from Christmas.

58:38.315 --> 58:39.781
I don't have time to be subtle.

58:39.817 --> 58:40.916
I think you should buy the inn.

58:40.951 --> 58:42.651
Mom, I cannot afford it.

58:42.686 --> 58:44.453
And besides,

58:44.488 --> 58:45.587
being an assistant manager
of a hotel

58:45.623 --> 58:47.823
does not make me qualify me
to run my own business.

58:47.858 --> 58:50.125
Really? What have you been
doing for the last three weeks?

58:50.160 --> 58:52.995
Well, I've been making
to-do lists and schedules.

58:53.030 --> 58:54.930
I've been pointing at things
people need to do,

58:54.965 --> 58:56.565
and I'm worrying that they're
not going to get done in time.

58:56.600 --> 58:58.901
Mm-hmm, that's what running
your business is all about.

59:00.437 --> 59:02.838
I could open up
my retirement account.

59:02.873 --> 59:06.375
No, absolutely not.
I can't let you do that.

59:07.811 --> 59:11.480
And besides, what if I...

59:11.515 --> 59:12.814
What if I tried and I failed?

59:12.850 --> 59:13.749
Oh.

59:13.784 --> 59:17.486
I mean, really,
what if it didn't work?

59:18.856 --> 59:20.255
I mean, it was dad's dream,

59:20.291 --> 59:22.090
and...

59:22.126 --> 59:24.927
I just couldn't say
goodbye twice, you know?

59:26.463 --> 59:28.063
[sighing]

59:29.166 --> 59:32.067
[♪♪♪]

59:45.082 --> 59:46.848
Tasha, hey, it's me.

59:48.052 --> 59:49.618
I'm good, thanks. How are you?

59:50.721 --> 59:53.989
Great. Hey, listen.
Could I ask you a favor, please?

59:54.024 --> 59:56.458
Would you mind sending me
the information

59:56.493 --> 59:58.860
for the last ten hotels
that the company's invested in?

59:58.896 --> 01:00:00.729
Yes.

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:03.365
Okay, that's perfect. Thank you.

01:00:08.739 --> 01:00:11.139
[♪♪♪]

01:00:15.379 --> 01:00:17.713
Hey. What's all this?

01:00:17.748 --> 01:00:19.381
Okay, picture this.

01:00:19.416 --> 01:00:21.650
The horse-drawn carriage
with Juni in it

01:00:21.685 --> 01:00:23.151
pulls up here,

01:00:23.187 --> 01:00:24.820
comes to a stop.

01:00:24.855 --> 01:00:26.588
She gets out,

01:00:26.624 --> 01:00:29.858
she comes up this path,
and as she does...

01:00:32.196 --> 01:00:34.663
Whoa!

01:00:34.698 --> 01:00:35.864
That's amazing!

01:00:35.899 --> 01:00:36.898
[Willow laughing]

01:00:36.934 --> 01:00:37.866
You did all this?

01:00:37.901 --> 01:00:40.736
Well, garrett did it,
but it was my idea.

01:00:40.771 --> 01:00:42.504
Well, it's a great idea.

01:00:42.539 --> 01:00:44.339
I can't wait
for natalie to see this.

01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:46.241
She's gonna love it.

01:00:47.578 --> 01:00:48.744
So, david, have you, uh...

01:00:48.779 --> 01:00:50.245
Talked anymore to that guy

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.848
who was interested
making an offer on the inn?

01:00:52.883 --> 01:00:55.417
Yeah, yeah. We've, uh,
we've been in touch.

01:00:55.452 --> 01:00:58.453
Oh. Okay. So, um...

01:00:58.489 --> 01:01:01.423
The last three weeks have...

01:01:01.458 --> 01:01:03.291
They've meant a lot to me.

01:01:03.327 --> 01:01:06.395
Being able to be here,

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:08.730
fix up the place, I...

01:01:08.766 --> 01:01:11.133
It's like I've gotten back
a piece of my past,

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:12.701
if that makes any sense?

01:01:12.736 --> 01:01:15.737
That makes total sense.
In fact, I feel the same way.

01:01:15.773 --> 01:01:17.439
- Really?
- Yeah. It's like

01:01:17.474 --> 01:01:18.373
I was waiting for a sign,

01:01:18.409 --> 01:01:20.542
and seeing this place like this
was it.

01:01:20.577 --> 01:01:23.078
I'm so glad you said that.

01:01:23.113 --> 01:01:24.179
Because it's telling me

01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:26.581
that eagle ridge has been around
before either of us,

01:01:26.617 --> 01:01:30.285
it's going to be here
long after we're gone,

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.720
and it's not really
about who owns it,

01:01:31.755 --> 01:01:34.156
it's-it's about the memories
we made here,

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:35.624
and bringing the inn
back to life

01:01:35.659 --> 01:01:37.592
has given me that closure...

01:01:37.628 --> 01:01:40.896
So that I can move on.

01:01:42.332 --> 01:01:44.266
That's great, david.

01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:45.967
I am very happy for you.

01:01:46.003 --> 01:01:48.270
I owe it all to you. Thank you.

01:01:50.474 --> 01:01:51.940
Well, it's getting late.

01:01:51.975 --> 01:01:53.675
I should go.

01:01:53.711 --> 01:01:55.410
Right.

01:01:55.446 --> 01:01:56.445
'Night.

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:58.413
Goodnight.

[♪♪♪]

01:02:17.468 --> 01:02:19.434
What's wrong?

01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:21.536
What makes you think
something is wrong?

01:02:21.572 --> 01:02:24.306
You're eating fruitcake
out of a pan.

01:02:24.341 --> 01:02:25.941
It's good fruitcake.

01:02:25.976 --> 01:02:27.843
No, it's not.
Why are you eating it?

01:02:27.878 --> 01:02:30.045
[laughing] because...

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.480
I need some comfort food.

01:02:31.515 --> 01:02:33.949
I'm getting married in a week.
I need comfort.

01:02:34.952 --> 01:02:37.486
You look like you could
use some fruitcake.

01:02:37.521 --> 01:02:39.321
I don't like fruitcake.

01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:42.357
Talk to me.

01:02:45.996 --> 01:02:47.028
All right, listen.

01:02:47.064 --> 01:02:49.965
Don't tell anyone, but I...

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.534
I kind of put together
a proposal

01:02:52.569 --> 01:02:55.637
about my company maybe
investing in eagle ridge.

01:02:55.672 --> 01:02:56.805
Investing?

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.707
- Yeah.
- Why?

01:02:58.742 --> 01:03:00.509
Well, I'd thought

01:03:00.544 --> 01:03:03.378
that david didn't really
want to sell it at all,

01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:06.014
that he was only letting it go
because he was too busy,

01:03:06.049 --> 01:03:07.516
and I thought, this way,

01:03:07.551 --> 01:03:11.386
if my company put in the money,
then maybe...

01:03:11.421 --> 01:03:13.021
I could run it.

01:03:13.056 --> 01:03:15.190
That would be amazing.

01:03:15.225 --> 01:03:16.491
Would your company do that?

01:03:16.527 --> 01:03:17.759
I don't know,

01:03:17.795 --> 01:03:19.094
and truthfully,
it doesn't matter,

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:22.764
because david wants to be done
with the inn.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.866
He just needs closure.

01:03:24.902 --> 01:03:26.668
Oh.

01:03:26.703 --> 01:03:29.337
I guess that's kind of
understandable, right?

01:03:29.373 --> 01:03:31.006
It's completely understandable.

01:03:31.041 --> 01:03:33.074
I mean,
the inn represents his past,

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:35.443
and he's ready to move on.

01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:37.078
Maybe you could buy it.

01:03:37.114 --> 01:03:38.847
Juni, I cannot afford it.

01:03:38.882 --> 01:03:40.382
Take out a loan!

01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:43.218
Unless...

01:03:43.253 --> 01:03:45.220
You don't want to do it
without david?

01:03:47.591 --> 01:03:49.925
I can admit

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:52.427
that part of
what's made this so fun

01:03:52.462 --> 01:03:55.630
has been doing all of this
with him... And natalie.

01:03:55.666 --> 01:03:57.232
Of course.

01:03:57.267 --> 01:03:59.234
Sounds like your feelings
for the inn are getting

01:03:59.269 --> 01:04:01.102
all mixed up
with your feelings for david.

01:04:01.138 --> 01:04:02.971
I only met him
a couple weeks ago.

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:04.873
I can't have feelings about him.

01:04:04.908 --> 01:04:05.907
Why not?

01:04:05.943 --> 01:04:06.808
Because...

01:04:06.844 --> 01:04:10.045
[sighs]
because it's just complicated.

01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:12.647
Because I might be a person

01:04:12.683 --> 01:04:14.482
who's pretty good
at solving problems,

01:04:14.518 --> 01:04:17.085
but I do not have a solution
for this one.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:23.024
Well, maybe your answer is
accepting how you really feel.

01:04:34.238 --> 01:04:35.737
Yes, the tree! This way.

01:04:38.809 --> 01:04:40.275
Over there.

01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:43.445
[♪♪♪]

01:05:04.735 --> 01:05:06.935
All right! We're getting close!

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:09.437
Looking good, guys.

Come in.

01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:59.187
Are you okay?
Mom said you needed me.

01:06:00.724 --> 01:06:02.724
I'm getting married
in a few hours.

01:06:02.759 --> 01:06:04.526
Yes, you are. It's okay.

01:06:04.561 --> 01:06:05.794
Everything's gonna be just fine.

01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:07.896
How?

01:06:07.931 --> 01:06:09.264
I have an idea.

01:06:11.268 --> 01:06:13.735
[chuckles] sorry.
We're all out of fruitcake.

01:06:13.770 --> 01:06:15.537
This is so much better.

01:06:15.572 --> 01:06:17.238
You're the best.

01:06:17.274 --> 01:06:18.540
Thanks.

01:06:20.243 --> 01:06:21.376
Mm.

01:06:24.181 --> 01:06:25.246
[clink]

01:06:33.957 --> 01:06:35.623
Merry wedding day.

01:06:35.659 --> 01:06:38.126
[laughing] hey. Thank you.

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:39.494
Everything's good?

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:40.762
Everything is great. Yeah.

01:06:40.797 --> 01:06:45.100
I mean, it's almost Christmas,
and I'm getting married today.

01:06:45.135 --> 01:06:46.134
No last-minute jitters?

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:47.502
Not a one.

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:49.304
Well, well, maybe one or two,

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:52.173
but that's only 'cause
I hate wearing tuxedos.

01:06:52.209 --> 01:06:53.008
I don't know how you do it.

01:06:53.043 --> 01:06:54.809
I don't know
how you stay so calm.

01:06:54.845 --> 01:06:56.511
Well, I had a good role model.

01:06:56.546 --> 01:06:59.114
Ugh, none of
this "david is wise" stuff.

01:06:59.149 --> 01:07:00.849
No. No, no, no,
that was me goofing around,

01:07:00.884 --> 01:07:02.217
but, this time, I'm serious.

01:07:03.453 --> 01:07:04.853
David, I know
I joke around a lot,

01:07:04.888 --> 01:07:07.522
but it's true, you are, like...

01:07:07.557 --> 01:07:11.359
Like the wiser,
much older brother I never had.

01:07:11.395 --> 01:07:13.094
I'm not that much older
than you.

01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:14.662
Seriously, man,
look at everything you've done.

01:07:14.698 --> 01:07:16.364
With the inn...

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.799
Raising natalie on your own...

01:07:17.834 --> 01:07:19.667
You're about to make partner.

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:23.938
How you do that all at once,
it's... It's amazing.

01:07:23.974 --> 01:07:25.273
Thank you.

01:07:25.308 --> 01:07:26.441
Seriously, I mean,

01:07:26.476 --> 01:07:27.475
sometimes, it just feels like

01:07:27.511 --> 01:07:29.310
I'm being pulled along
for the ride, you know?

01:07:29.346 --> 01:07:31.780
Ah, everybody feels like that
every now and then,

01:07:31.815 --> 01:07:33.681
but you're gonna figure it out.

01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:34.849
You always do.

01:07:34.885 --> 01:07:38.653
It's like... like the work
that you did here with Willow.

01:07:38.688 --> 01:07:40.789
You saw an opportunity

01:07:40.824 --> 01:07:42.457
to make this place
more attractive

01:07:42.492 --> 01:07:43.525
to the guy who wants to buy it,

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:45.026
and it's looking good, right?

01:07:45.062 --> 01:07:46.694
Yeah, it's looking great.

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:48.196
You see?
It's all coming together.

01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:50.465
[unconvincingly] yeah.

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:53.535
Unless...
There's a part that isn't.

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:55.804
No! It's great.

01:07:56.873 --> 01:07:58.006
Okay. Okay.

01:07:58.041 --> 01:08:00.508
Well, hey, whatever it is,
you're gonna figure it out.

01:08:00.544 --> 01:08:02.043
If you think so?

01:08:02.079 --> 01:08:04.212
Yeah, yeah, I didn't make you
my best man for nothing.

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:05.447
[laughs] all right?

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:08.750
Can't believe
you're getting married!

01:08:08.785 --> 01:08:10.018
Yeah. I can't believe it either.

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:15.156
[Juni sighs]

01:08:15.192 --> 01:08:16.124
I still think

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:17.591
you should tell david
about your proposal.

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:19.227
It's not that easy.

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:20.428
It should be.

01:08:20.464 --> 01:08:23.098
Just... Tell him what you want.

01:08:23.133 --> 01:08:24.599
What if I'm not sure
what I want?

01:08:24.634 --> 01:08:26.501
What if it doesn't even matter
what I want?

01:08:27.703 --> 01:08:29.938
Of course, it matters
what you want.

01:08:29.973 --> 01:08:32.273
And... You're always sure.

01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:34.274
Remember, when we were kids,

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.243
and we used to sit
around the Christmas tree

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:37.045
and dad would ask us

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:38.712
which gift
we wanted to open first?

01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:39.948
Mm-hmm.

01:08:39.983 --> 01:08:41.381
You could never decide.

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:43.451
[both laugh]

01:08:43.487 --> 01:08:45.687
Because, I didn't want
my first present to be...

01:08:45.721 --> 01:08:47.555
Something special,

01:08:47.591 --> 01:08:49.256
not something like socks.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:51.926
You knew, you always knew,

01:08:51.962 --> 01:08:53.361
where the good ones were.

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:54.761
Mm, not this time.

01:08:54.798 --> 01:08:56.764
Right now, everything
looks like socks.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.299
[Juni chuckles]

01:08:58.335 --> 01:09:01.069
So... What are you gonna do?

01:09:01.104 --> 01:09:02.737
You have to open something.

01:09:02.772 --> 01:09:04.037
Do I?

01:09:04.073 --> 01:09:05.607
I mean, can't I just
be here with you

01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:06.975
and eat some cookies?

01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:08.076
You could,

01:09:08.111 --> 01:09:10.078
except...

01:09:10.113 --> 01:09:12.447
I kind of
have to start getting ready.

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:14.582
I'm getting married today.

01:09:14.618 --> 01:09:16.551
Mm-hmm. Yeah, you are.

01:09:16.586 --> 01:09:18.118
[both chuckling]

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:19.554
Mm.

01:09:19.589 --> 01:09:21.689
[♪♪♪]

01:09:29.799 --> 01:09:30.832
Finished.

01:09:30.867 --> 01:09:33.268
I know...

01:09:33.303 --> 01:09:34.602
We cut it a little close.

01:09:34.638 --> 01:09:36.770
You got it done in time
before the wedding,

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:38.238
that's all that matters.

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:39.240
Can I see it?

01:09:39.276 --> 01:09:40.942
It's all yours.

01:09:43.813 --> 01:09:45.846
You're not gonna come in?

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:47.749
No.

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:50.484
I know my crew and me
did a lot of the work, but...

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.819
This was your vision.

01:09:52.856 --> 01:09:54.422
I think you should do it
on your own.

01:09:54.457 --> 01:09:55.790
Thank you, garrett.

01:09:56.826 --> 01:09:58.326
For everything.

01:10:01.965 --> 01:10:04.399
[Willow sighs deeply]

01:10:10.473 --> 01:10:13.074
[♪♪♪]

01:10:24.487 --> 01:10:26.955
Willow, this is...

01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:29.190
I know, right?

01:10:29.226 --> 01:10:30.458
I-I don't even know what to say.

01:10:30.493 --> 01:10:31.426
I mean... [chuckles]

01:10:33.697 --> 01:10:37.065
Actually, you know what?
I do know what to say.

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:39.334
Your father
would be very proud of you.

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:41.369
Thank you.

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:43.037
You're welcome.

01:10:44.374 --> 01:10:45.673
David, we need to talk.

01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:48.042
I know.

01:10:52.716 --> 01:10:54.916
Why is it so hard to know
what to say to you?

01:10:54.951 --> 01:10:56.150
I was just thinking that.

01:10:56.186 --> 01:10:57.852
[chuckles]

01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:04.659
I think that we should just try
being honest with each other.

01:11:06.029 --> 01:11:08.930
You heard that I got the offer
for the inn?

01:11:08.965 --> 01:11:10.365
An offer?

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.499
Yeah.

01:11:11.534 --> 01:11:13.901
Uh, robert? Right?

01:11:13.937 --> 01:11:15.336
He said it was
the carriage rides

01:11:15.372 --> 01:11:16.271
that put him over.

01:11:16.306 --> 01:11:17.739
Told you.

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:19.607
[chuckles] yeah...

01:11:19.643 --> 01:11:20.775
Are you gonna take it?

01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:23.211
I think I have to, you know?

01:11:24.748 --> 01:11:26.347
Right. The closure.

01:11:26.383 --> 01:11:27.882
Mm-hmm.

01:11:27.917 --> 01:11:29.784
You know, I just... I've...

01:11:29.819 --> 01:11:32.887
I have felt stuck
these last three years and...

01:11:32.922 --> 01:11:37.125
Like I'm waist-deep in snow
and I just can't get out.

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.527
And if you sell the inn,
you get...

01:11:39.562 --> 01:11:42.263
Unstuck, and...?

01:11:42.299 --> 01:11:44.499
Yeah, something like that.

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:48.303
I have you to thank for it, so...

01:11:48.338 --> 01:11:50.872
- You're making a huge mistake.
- What?

01:11:50.907 --> 01:11:53.241
I don't think
you should sell the inn.

01:11:54.678 --> 01:11:56.544
What are you talking about?

01:11:56.579 --> 01:11:58.413
You love it here, david!

01:11:58.448 --> 01:12:01.149
I can see it in your eyes
every time you look around.

01:12:01.184 --> 01:12:03.618
That doesn't mean
that I shouldn't sell it.

01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:06.054
Yes. Yes, that's exactly
what it means.

01:12:06.089 --> 01:12:09.123
You should always stay
and fight for what you love.

01:12:11.294 --> 01:12:14.262
I know you think that this place
represents your past,

01:12:14.297 --> 01:12:17.665
but I...

01:12:17.701 --> 01:12:19.067
I think it's your future.

01:12:19.102 --> 01:12:21.436
What kind of future
can I have here?

01:12:21.471 --> 01:12:22.970
Every time I look around,

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:25.907
all I see are these...

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:29.110
These memories.

01:12:29.145 --> 01:12:31.512
That's not a bad thing.

01:12:31.548 --> 01:12:33.481
You don't have to let go
of your memories

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:34.782
in order to make new ones.

01:12:34.818 --> 01:12:36.684
There's always...

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:39.787
There's room in our hearts
for more.

01:12:40.957 --> 01:12:42.990
I don't think I can.

01:12:43.026 --> 01:12:45.560
You don't want to try?

01:12:48.798 --> 01:12:50.465
I'm sorry.

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:55.970
I just have to, um...

01:12:56.005 --> 01:12:57.171
Get ready for the wedding.

Dearly beloved,

01:14:47.116 --> 01:14:48.282
we are gathered here today

01:14:48.318 --> 01:14:50.218
to join this man and woman

01:14:50.253 --> 01:14:52.920
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

01:14:52.956 --> 01:14:55.490
So glad to see so many friends
and family

01:14:55.525 --> 01:14:57.425
on this momentous occasion.

Oh.

01:15:20.483 --> 01:15:22.650
- [clink]
- thank you.

01:15:22.685 --> 01:15:24.919
I knew from the moment I met you

01:15:24.954 --> 01:15:27.121
you were a person who was
good at taking care of things.

01:15:27.156 --> 01:15:30.424
Well... I'm just glad
it all worked out.

01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:32.426
So, what's next for you?

01:15:32.462 --> 01:15:34.762
What big job
are you going to tackle?

01:15:34.797 --> 01:15:37.331
Well, I'll go back to New York

01:15:37.367 --> 01:15:40.868
and then I might be
getting transferred to denver.

01:15:40.904 --> 01:15:42.036
Is that what you want?

01:15:42.071 --> 01:15:43.070
No.

01:15:43.106 --> 01:15:45.873
Well, for heaven's sakes,
why are you doing it?

01:15:45.909 --> 01:15:48.976
Because I...
Don't have a choice.

01:15:49.012 --> 01:15:50.878
Willow.

01:15:50.914 --> 01:15:52.780
You always have a choice.

01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:56.050
I've never seen david

01:15:56.085 --> 01:15:57.685
so engaged,

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:58.953
so passionate,

01:15:58.988 --> 01:16:00.221
so happy

01:16:00.256 --> 01:16:01.689
as he's been
the last few weeks...

01:16:01.724 --> 01:16:04.158
In a long time.

01:16:04.193 --> 01:16:10.631
Right, but david wants
to let go of his past, so...

01:16:10.667 --> 01:16:13.067
The past isn't something
you let go of.

01:16:13.102 --> 01:16:15.336
It's something you learn from,

01:16:15.371 --> 01:16:17.138
to build a future from.

01:16:17.173 --> 01:16:19.774
I think that's what
you really want.

01:16:21.511 --> 01:16:24.312
Well, you don't always
get what you want.

01:16:24.347 --> 01:16:27.481
If my son is as smart
as I think he is...

01:16:27.517 --> 01:16:28.683
You will.

What's going on, kiddo?

01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:58.913
- Nothing.
- Are you...

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:01.282
Are you not having a good time?

01:17:01.317 --> 01:17:03.084
No, I did.

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:04.552
The wedding was really pretty.

01:17:04.587 --> 01:17:06.921
It was, wasn't it?

01:17:07.924 --> 01:17:10.725
Was that what you and mom's
wedding was like?

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.960
Well, not really,

01:17:12.996 --> 01:17:14.495
'cause we got married
in a church,

01:17:14.530 --> 01:17:15.429
not a barn,

01:17:15.465 --> 01:17:17.732
and ours didn't take place
at Christmas,

01:17:17.767 --> 01:17:20.735
so we didn't have
all these beautiful decorations.

01:17:20.770 --> 01:17:23.504
But it was still fun?

01:17:23.539 --> 01:17:26.173
Yes. It was...

01:17:26.209 --> 01:17:27.842
Wonderful.

01:17:27.877 --> 01:17:30.578
It was a great way
to start our lives together.

01:17:32.281 --> 01:17:34.382
I wish I could've been there.

01:17:35.685 --> 01:17:40.021
Well, it was a few years
before we met you,

01:17:40.056 --> 01:17:42.823
but you were there
in our dreams that day.

01:17:46.896 --> 01:17:48.696
What's wrong?

01:17:48.731 --> 01:17:50.431
It's just...

01:17:50.466 --> 01:17:52.333
It's almost Christmas eve,

01:17:52.368 --> 01:17:54.101
and we still
haven't found henry.

01:17:54.137 --> 01:17:55.536
[sighing]

01:17:55.571 --> 01:17:57.004
I know.

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.873
He's so good at hiding,
isn't he?

01:17:58.908 --> 01:18:01.442
[laughs]

01:18:01.477 --> 01:18:05.079
I mean, I guess we can't leave
if we can't find him.

01:18:06.315 --> 01:18:08.449
What do you mean?

01:18:09.719 --> 01:18:12.353
We can't leave without henry.

01:18:13.589 --> 01:18:15.489
Sweetie,

01:18:15.525 --> 01:18:17.058
we can't stay here.

01:18:17.093 --> 01:18:18.526
Someone else
is gonna be moving in.

01:18:20.196 --> 01:18:22.329
But mom gave him to me.

01:18:22.365 --> 01:18:24.365
We can't just forget about him.

01:18:25.735 --> 01:18:30.404
No, I mean,
we're not just gonna forget.

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:31.906
No matter where we go,

01:18:31.941 --> 01:18:34.709
we're always gonna have
our good memories.

01:18:34.744 --> 01:18:37.878
Well, why can't we make
more good memories here?

01:18:37.914 --> 01:18:39.747
Did we use them all up?

01:18:39.782 --> 01:18:41.649
We <i> can't</i> make more?

Tasha, hi.

01:19:05.041 --> 01:19:06.907
I just wanted to leave word

01:19:06.943 --> 01:19:08.542
and let you know
that I'm actually

01:19:08.578 --> 01:19:11.278
going to be heading back
a little earlier than expected.

01:19:11.314 --> 01:19:15.082

In the bookshelf.

01:20:16.445 --> 01:20:18.646
I found...

01:20:18.681 --> 01:20:21.148
My father's copy
of <i> a Christmas carol.</i>

01:20:21.184 --> 01:20:23.617
I-I thought it was lost.

I don't believe it.

01:20:25.555 --> 01:20:27.021
I do.

01:20:27.056 --> 01:20:30.991
I got my Christmas wish
two whole days early.

01:20:31.027 --> 01:20:31.992
Aw.

01:20:32.028 --> 01:20:34.495
That's pretty amazing, sweetie.

We didn't run out of memories.

01:20:36.966 --> 01:20:38.866
No...

01:20:38.901 --> 01:20:39.934
We didn't.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.019
Hey.

01:20:59.055 --> 01:20:59.987
Hi.

01:21:00.022 --> 01:21:02.356
So when were you gonna
tell me about this?

01:21:03.492 --> 01:21:06.861
Oh, just something I was
carrying around for a few days.

01:21:06.896 --> 01:21:09.663
It's actually a
proposal I put together

01:21:09.699 --> 01:21:10.898
about my company

01:21:10.933 --> 01:21:12.700
potentially investing
in eagle ridge.

01:21:12.735 --> 01:21:14.635
Yes, I know. I read it.

01:21:16.572 --> 01:21:18.205
I just... I only did that

01:21:18.241 --> 01:21:19.640
because I thought
it was what you might want.

01:21:19.675 --> 01:21:21.075
Look.

01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:23.244
I-I appreciate you putting
so much work into this,

01:21:23.279 --> 01:21:24.879
really, but...

01:21:24.914 --> 01:21:26.413
I can't let you invest.

01:21:26.449 --> 01:21:29.550
I know that. Closure.

01:21:29.585 --> 01:21:32.286
I can't let you because...

01:21:33.522 --> 01:21:34.788
I'm keeping it.

01:21:35.925 --> 01:21:37.992
I called robert and told him

01:21:38.027 --> 01:21:39.093
that I'm pulling it
off the market.

01:21:39.128 --> 01:21:43.030
But what about your job?
What about being a partner?

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:45.032
What about getting
"back on track"?

01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:46.600
I think I need a new track.

01:21:46.636 --> 01:21:49.136
And I didn't realize that
until...

01:21:51.374 --> 01:21:53.007
You showed me.

01:21:54.443 --> 01:21:55.843
You know, we talked about

01:21:55.878 --> 01:21:58.512
all the memories
that we have of this place...

01:21:58.547 --> 01:21:59.580
Mm-hmm?

01:21:59.615 --> 01:22:02.850
And I just started thinking
that mine were gone,

01:22:02.885 --> 01:22:05.052
lost, and then...

01:22:07.123 --> 01:22:09.390
I realized that we're creating
new memories all the time.

01:22:11.661 --> 01:22:13.594
And I would love

01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:16.897
to continue making new
memories with you.

01:22:16.933 --> 01:22:19.300
I would like that.

01:22:19.335 --> 01:22:21.101
Um...

01:22:21.137 --> 01:22:22.970
I probably need some help

01:22:23.005 --> 01:22:24.872
and I was thinking
of hiring a manager...

01:22:24.907 --> 01:22:26.907
But I know you have a job.

01:22:26.943 --> 01:22:28.809
Well, I would consider it.

01:22:28.844 --> 01:22:30.711
On one condition.

01:22:30.746 --> 01:22:32.780
Name it.

01:22:32.815 --> 01:22:35.282
You have to let me paint.

01:22:38.421 --> 01:22:39.453
Deal.

01:22:41.090 --> 01:22:42.790
You said you didn't know a good reason

01:22:42.825 --> 01:22:44.725
to want you to move back here.

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:46.327
No.

01:22:46.362 --> 01:22:47.628
I said

01:22:47.663 --> 01:22:50.297
I'd know it when I saw it.
