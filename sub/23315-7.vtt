WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:10.633 --> 00:12.900
Oi-oi! We're back!

00:16.467 --> 00:18.367
Get me back in that house.

00:19.467 --> 00:21.500
Stand by. Geordies incoming.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.767
Oh, my God.

00:28.400 --> 00:31.100
I'm so excited, I
ka-ka-poo-pooed
in my knickers.

00:38.900 --> 00:41.900
What's the three things
that Geordies are good at?

00:41.967 --> 00:43.567
Bucking...

00:43.633 --> 00:45.400
...necking...

00:45.467 --> 00:46.867
...and drinking.

00:49.100 --> 00:51.300
Toon, we are coming for you.

00:54.900 --> 00:57.600
Shit's about to go down.

00:57.667 --> 00:59.100
This is mint.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.400
I took it way too far.
I feel terrible.

01:08.467 --> 01:10.833
Toon Tours are going to
Tenerife.

01:10.900 --> 01:12.800
Aaron, you won't be going.

01:16.067 --> 01:17.433
God, I need this.

01:17.500 --> 01:20.933
I have been so sexually
frustrated.
My boyfriend's not here,

01:21.000 --> 01:22.400
so I can't get a shag.

01:22.467 --> 01:24.700
This is the best idea
you've ever had.

01:24.767 --> 01:29.067
Sam and Chloe are all over each
other. I wanna be in love, too.

01:33.200 --> 01:37.500
Hallelujah! I had sex. But he
was
a little bit quick, though.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.867
I thought this was all sorted.
Fuck's sake, man.

01:45.400 --> 01:49.667
I need to do something about
this.
Even if it's the last thing I
want.

01:51.233 --> 01:54.600
Abbie's tears got into Chloe's
head.
She's fucked it for us.

01:54.667 --> 02:00.100
I've lost something good in here
for someone downstairs, right!

02:00.167 --> 02:01.567
It's unfair.

02:01.633 --> 02:05.233
It's all aimed at me.
I am so fucking drunk tonight.

02:05.300 --> 02:09.133
Make-up sex is always the best.
(laughs)

02:10.967 --> 02:13.333
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:13.400 --> 02:16.400
I'm a lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

02:16.467 --> 02:19.200
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

02:19.267 --> 02:21.200
I'm preened to perfection.

02:21.267 --> 02:23.433
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:23.500 --> 02:26.167
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.967
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:29.033 --> 02:32.233
I might be entirely bonkers,
but all the best people are.

02:32.933 --> 02:35.067
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:47.533 --> 02:48.733
Morning.

02:48.800 --> 02:52.767
Oh, my God.
I am hanging out my arse.

02:52.833 --> 02:55.033
I don't remember anything
last night.

02:55.100 --> 02:58.633
Nathan could have been riding
around
the house on a unicorn.

02:58.700 --> 03:01.167
You were on a different level
last night.

03:01.233 --> 03:04.600
I don't know if I want to talk
about it. I'm highly
embarrassed.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.833
Was there drama?
Yeah.

03:06.900 --> 03:10.233
Last night was one of the worst
nights I've had in this house.

03:10.300 --> 03:12.500
Felt like I was fighting
a losing battle,

03:12.567 --> 03:14.900
trying to explain why I was
upset.

03:14.967 --> 03:16.933
And now everything is a mess.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.100
I don't think I've tried
to make it more clear to
everyone,

03:20.167 --> 03:24.367
it's not Sam I'm bothered about.
I've
said Sam and Chloe are better
suited.

03:24.433 --> 03:26.133
Shit. You know what will help?

03:26.200 --> 03:28.233
Food from my dad's restaurant.
Yes!

03:28.300 --> 03:30.533
I'm gonna ring my dad.
Get the order in.

03:30.600 --> 03:31.833
I'll get the order in.

03:33.133 --> 03:35.400
Morning, Nathan, morning.

03:35.467 --> 03:39.467
So last night went fucking west.
And
you, trying to break that
window.

03:39.533 --> 03:43.300
And you were sat on top of his
cock,
bouncing on it, I was like...

03:43.367 --> 03:47.100
Last night went from me and
Chloe
nearly calling it a day to
banging.

03:47.167 --> 03:49.800
She's a bit all over the place
but needs to chill

03:49.867 --> 03:51.867
so we can enjoy time with each
other.

03:51.933 --> 03:53.567
I thought you were going home.

03:53.633 --> 03:56.600
She was till Mother Theresa
came into the equation.

03:56.667 --> 03:59.967
We are stronger and I don't want
to rub it in anyone's face.

04:00.033 --> 04:02.367
That's why I feel
I need to take a step out.

04:02.433 --> 04:05.133
I think Abbie wants everyone
in this house to know

04:05.200 --> 04:06.633
that she does not like Sam.

04:06.700 --> 04:08.767
I don't know what's going on
with Abbie

04:08.833 --> 04:11.867
but there was pressure
on mine and Sam's relationship

04:11.933 --> 04:13.967
and mine and Abbie's friendship.

04:14.033 --> 04:15.867
This is getting more out of
hand.

04:15.933 --> 04:17.933
I think about what people think.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.700
I need to stop that.
I need to do what makes me
happy.

04:20.767 --> 04:24.033
You've always wanted this.
You shouldn't let someone

04:24.100 --> 04:26.300
stop you from having this.

04:28.567 --> 04:30.800
Hello, you.

04:30.867 --> 04:35.433
Dad, let's cut to the chase. We
need
a hangover dinner sorting for
later.

04:35.500 --> 04:39.533
The only thing sorts a hangover
out.
I need a roast dinner.

04:39.600 --> 04:40.900
Love you, Dad!

04:41.900 --> 04:45.100
Put a hand in with breakfast!
Go on, then.

04:45.167 --> 04:47.900
I feel so uncomfortable in the
house
this morning,

04:47.967 --> 04:50.233
but I've got to get up
and face everyone.

04:50.300 --> 04:52.033
How do you feel about last
night?

04:52.100 --> 04:54.300
I just feel like
I never wanted this,

04:54.367 --> 04:57.467
I can't believe it's actually
happened over a boy.

04:57.533 --> 05:00.367
I understand why Abbie's upset,
but her and Chloe

05:00.433 --> 05:03.167
need to speak to each other
this morning, sober,

05:03.233 --> 05:05.533
so we can put this love triangle
to bed.

05:05.600 --> 05:10.167
Don't worry, my little ducks.
Papa
Nathan will take care of
everyone.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.767
Hello.
Morning, all.

05:12.833 --> 05:16.133
Oh, God. Here we go.
This is gonna be awkward.

05:22.333 --> 05:25.433
Can someone please break
this awkward silence?

05:25.500 --> 05:31.233
Well, today, I'm gonna take yous
two
out and Sophie and Abbie and
Chloe.

05:31.300 --> 05:34.867
I think yous two need to stay in
and have a little chat. Right?

05:34.933 --> 05:36.233
Hello?

05:37.367 --> 05:39.367
Yes? Yes, I'm happy.
Yes?

05:39.433 --> 05:42.233
Right. We haven't got long,
so you all go get ready.

05:46.033 --> 05:48.267
Yous, I can't face going out.

05:48.333 --> 05:51.567
I'm all for giving Chloe and
Abbie
space to sort things out,

05:51.633 --> 05:54.867
but I'm way too hungover
to go anywhere. So sorry,
Nathan,

05:54.933 --> 05:56.567
I'm going back to bed.

05:57.733 --> 06:00.433
The rest of the guys don't know
where we're going

06:00.500 --> 06:03.100
so I'm gonna dress
in the appropriate attire

06:03.167 --> 06:05.033
and see if they have a clue.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.367
You've got a bucket on.

06:07.433 --> 06:11.167
I've got no idea where we're
going,
but we're either gonna come back

06:11.233 --> 06:13.967
Chloe and Abbie best mates
or with one of them dead.

06:14.033 --> 06:15.900
My guess is dead.

06:21.133 --> 06:24.500
Shit. This is even more awkward
than I thought.

06:24.567 --> 06:27.467
I don't think we're gonna get
anywhere today.

06:30.500 --> 06:34.433
We might be getting out the
house
to give Abbie and Chloe some
space,

06:34.500 --> 06:37.533
but this is a perfect
opportunity
for me to put the newbies

06:37.600 --> 06:41.100
through their paces and find out
how radgetastic they truly are.

06:41.167 --> 06:42.733
Fucking dancing?

06:42.800 --> 06:46.567
Are you fucking joking me?
Why would I wanna go dancing?

06:46.633 --> 06:48.500
I've got two fucking left feet.

06:48.567 --> 06:51.633
This is street dance.
Yous can teach me. I haven't a
clue.

06:51.700 --> 06:54.667
Sam, I don't give a fuck
if you don't wanna do this.

06:54.733 --> 06:57.767
I played football for you,
so you can dance for me.

06:59.533 --> 07:01.100
Five, six, seven...

07:01.167 --> 07:02.933
(hip-hop music plays)

07:05.667 --> 07:09.500
To be honest, I'm more of a
raver
than a street dancer.

07:09.567 --> 07:11.867
What about this? (laughs)

07:11.933 --> 07:13.900
You look like a fucking chicken.

07:15.367 --> 07:17.700
My hair! Look like I've been
electrocuted.

07:17.767 --> 07:20.000
Like... (tearing sound) Ooh.
(laughter)

07:20.067 --> 07:24.967
This tracksuit is getting me too
hot.
My undercarriage is soaking wet.

07:25.033 --> 07:26.467
That feels so much better.

07:26.533 --> 07:29.200
If he didn't look like a twat
already, he does now.

07:29.267 --> 07:32.100
It's a dance move, the ball pop.
(laughter)

07:33.433 --> 07:36.100
I look like one of them
fucking inflatable things

07:36.167 --> 07:38.600
you see outside a car garage
in the wind.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.867
You can do it, I'm watching.
Come on.

07:42.933 --> 07:44.367
Not for me.
Don't give up.

07:44.433 --> 07:46.633
I'm not a dancer.
Don't wanna be a dancer.

07:46.700 --> 07:47.867
I do.

07:47.933 --> 07:51.333
What do you think the girls are
up to? Pulling each other's
hair?

07:51.400 --> 07:53.767
I know Chloe.
If someone raises their voice,

07:53.833 --> 07:55.967
Chloe shouts louder
and then kicks off.

07:56.033 --> 07:58.467
I've grown close to Abbie
since being here.

07:58.533 --> 08:02.533
It was horrible seeing her
upset,
so I hope they've made up.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.500
We're going to football next
week,
Nathan. Fuck off.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.633
Me and Chloe were so close,

08:12.700 --> 08:15.500
and now I feel like
we couldn't be further apart.

08:15.567 --> 08:17.433
We really need to talk this out.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.133
Last night was crazy.
I know.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.667
Do you like Sam?
No. I like him as a person,

08:21.733 --> 08:23.933
as a friend,
but not in that way at all.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.233
I need to get my point across
that me crying was nothing to do

08:27.300 --> 08:31.033
with Chloe and Sam. It was just
me
being drunk and being very
lonely.

08:31.100 --> 08:33.933
I do want you to be happy
together.
You're my friend.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.900
I just felt more lonely than
ever cos
I wanted you to be my friend as
well

08:37.967 --> 08:39.366
cos I did feel like shit.

08:39.433 --> 08:43.400
I don't want you to feel like
that.
I should have been there for
you,

08:43.467 --> 08:46.700
and I apologise I wasn't.
I got the wrong end of the
stick.

08:46.767 --> 08:50.700
I feel bad things went this far.
I've got insecurities about
boys.

08:50.767 --> 08:54.533
I'm trying to protect myself
because
I do not want to get hurt again.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.600
I've just been hurt by, like,
Martin massively.

08:57.667 --> 09:01.433
Inside, it's killed us a little
bit,
and I just want to be happy.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.367
I like Sam a lot and I'm scared
now
of losing him.

09:04.433 --> 09:08.033
I don't want you to feel I'm
putting
pressure on it because I'm not.

09:08.100 --> 09:09.800
I want you to feel you've got
me.

09:09.867 --> 09:11.500
Should we hug it out?
Yeah.

09:11.567 --> 09:14.200
I'm so glad me and Chloe
have sorted things out,

09:14.267 --> 09:18.100
and hopefully we'll never
let a boy come in between us
again.

09:19.733 --> 09:22.533
We get back to the house
and I just hope us lot

09:22.600 --> 09:26.767
leaving Abbie and Chloe together
has
worked and it's not World War
Three.

09:26.833 --> 09:29.000
Is it safe to come in?
Hello.

09:29.067 --> 09:31.333
Any fights going on?
What are you wearing?

09:31.400 --> 09:34.000
I cannot take him serious.
Like Fatman Scoop.

09:34.067 --> 09:35.700
Thank you.

09:35.767 --> 09:39.367
There's no weave or blood on
the floor, so they can't have
fought.

09:39.433 --> 09:42.800
How are yous?
Me and Abbie are friends now.

09:42.867 --> 09:45.600
We're gonna put it to bed now
in a double mattress.

09:45.667 --> 09:47.800
I feel like no more tension
or nothing.

09:47.867 --> 09:51.467
Thank God the girls have sorted
it
out cos the whole love triangle

09:51.533 --> 09:55.200
has been dominating the house.
Hopefully now, we can all move
on.

09:55.267 --> 09:57.667
Good you made up.
We'll have a good night.

09:57.733 --> 09:59.633
Right.
Oh, hello, you.

09:59.700 --> 10:03.600
I think I'm finally recovering.
Yay!

10:03.667 --> 10:05.733
I need some food. I'm starving.

10:05.800 --> 10:09.300
I called my dad in my hungover
hour of need ages ago.

10:09.367 --> 10:11.467
Where the fuck is our dinner?

10:13.133 --> 10:15.400
Like that, bitch?
(knocking)

10:17.367 --> 10:19.867
(cheering)

10:19.933 --> 10:23.800
What the hell? Joel's here!
And he's brought the roast.

10:23.867 --> 10:25.900
I feel like Christmas
has come early.

10:25.967 --> 10:29.467
But why the fuck is he dressed
as a naked chef?

10:29.533 --> 10:32.100
God's sake!
Got pants on?

10:32.167 --> 10:33.767
Oh, my God, he's naked!

10:33.833 --> 10:36.367
You got your willy out?
I got a sock over it.

10:36.433 --> 10:38.933
Turn around.
Nathan! Sorry, Soph.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.367
Joel's walked in
and all I can think about

10:41.433 --> 10:43.767
is sliding my hot dog
in between his buns.

10:43.833 --> 10:46.267
Get the plates out!
Someone clean the table!

10:46.333 --> 10:48.367
Feeding time at the zoo!

10:48.433 --> 10:51.000
Nathan, that sexy bum is mine.

10:51.067 --> 10:56.067
And now that Joel's here he can
help
relieve some of my sexual
tension.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.867
Thank God.

10:57.933 --> 11:00.667
Gonna wash me hands cos I just
fingered Joel's arse.

11:00.733 --> 11:02.433
Well. I guess it is easy access.

11:02.500 --> 11:03.767
On that note, let's eat!

11:04.600 --> 11:07.267
You two are together?
Boyfriend and girlfriend?

11:07.333 --> 11:08.667
Nah.
I've just choked.

11:08.733 --> 11:10.133
Are you exclusive?
No.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.800
Nah, not yet.
Going on the pull with other
people?

11:12.867 --> 11:14.933
Not going the pull.
It's complicated.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.967
This is awkward because
I want to be exclusive with Sam,

11:18.033 --> 11:21.633
but I don't know how he feels,
especially after last night.

11:21.700 --> 11:24.300
I'm so thankful
that you brought this.

11:24.367 --> 11:27.600
Thanks, cuz!
# Oh, Sophie's dad, we love you
#

11:27.667 --> 11:31.600
This jacket's turned me into
a football hooligan. (screams)

11:31.667 --> 11:34.200
Let's get ready for tonight!
(all yelling)

11:34.267 --> 11:38.967
I am buzzing for tonight because
the atmosphere in the house is
mint.

11:39.033 --> 11:43.167
No, cos my dick will come out.
(yelling)

11:43.233 --> 11:46.500
I've missed Joel's sausage,
but we need to leave him alone,

11:46.567 --> 11:48.400
get ready for the Toon.

11:48.467 --> 11:49.767
Pow!

11:59.367 --> 12:04.400
This is my idea of fun. Just me
and
the lads, chilling in the
shower.

12:04.467 --> 12:06.200
This isn't weird at all.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.900
Aaron and Marnie have been gone
a long time. We don't know

12:18.967 --> 12:20.800
if or when they're gonna come
back.

12:38.167 --> 12:40.067
I don't know how I'm gonna
drink.

12:40.133 --> 12:41.900
I feel like cos Joel's here now,

12:41.967 --> 12:44.333
like, have you seen
the states he gets in?

12:44.400 --> 12:47.167
Does he get worse than you?
Oh, my God.

12:47.233 --> 12:49.567
Probably shit yourself again.
Shut up.

12:49.633 --> 12:52.733
It's so nice to have some girl
time.
I'm buzzing.

12:52.800 --> 12:56.200
Everything has gone back to
normal.
Tonight is gonna be messy.

12:56.267 --> 12:59.133
Right, howay then, yous. Let's
go!
Come on!

13:00.533 --> 13:04.400
Girls!
Girls! Coat on.

13:04.467 --> 13:07.433
Girls!
Ooh, back on the drink, are we?

13:07.500 --> 13:10.267
I'm buzzing Joel's here
and everybody is happy.

13:10.333 --> 13:12.133
(all) Cheers!

13:12.200 --> 13:15.133
Let's get out on the Toon
and have a proper family night.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.067
Get your jacket. You've pulled.

13:22.600 --> 13:25.633
Haway, Sam. we're going to
the bathroom for a quickie.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.633
Fuck! I nearly killed Joel!

13:28.700 --> 13:31.233
I was going to relieve
my sexual frustration,

13:31.300 --> 13:34.300
but now he's got his head
in a bucket!

13:38.967 --> 13:39.167
.

13:41.700 --> 13:41.900
.

13:49.600 --> 13:52.900
We get to Florita's and we
couldn't
be more up for tonight.

13:52.967 --> 13:54.000
Let's have it.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.800
Tonight we are sticking together
as a family

13:58.867 --> 14:01.667
and we're mixing things up
by drinking cocktails.

14:04.167 --> 14:07.700
Classy? Yeah, right.
When does that ever happen?

14:13.567 --> 14:15.167
I'm having the best night.

14:15.233 --> 14:19.200
And I'm buzzing that I have
my sexy boyfriend here.

14:29.433 --> 14:32.533
I'm so happy I didn't leave
because I do really like Sam.

14:32.600 --> 14:35.633
I will try my hardest to be cool
and not kick off any more.

14:42.867 --> 14:46.900
Sam told us he's proud of us.
Who
the hell does he think he is? My
ma?

14:52.733 --> 14:56.633
I'm enjoying spending time with
Chloe. One good thing of last
night

14:56.700 --> 14:59.700
was the make up sex,
but I'm taking things slow
because

14:59.767 --> 15:03.533
she's got a habit of tarnishing
me
with the same brush as her exes.

15:19.133 --> 15:22.367
Tonight's vibe couldn't be
more different than last night

15:22.433 --> 15:23.500
and I feel so happy.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.567
I'm glad Abbie's feeling happier
and I hope she doesn't still
think

15:31.633 --> 15:33.967
that she needs a boy
to feel complete.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.800
Sophie, I am very sorry.
I go by the moral,

15:52.867 --> 15:55.533
"If I'm not getting any,
you're not getting none."

16:03.133 --> 16:06.567
Fucking hell, Nathan. Stop
trying
to get my boyfriend mortal.

16:06.633 --> 16:10.200
I want to have sex with him
later.
Are you trying to fannyblock me?

16:17.733 --> 16:20.167
It feels so good
in the club tonight.

16:20.233 --> 16:24.100
Everyone's just like little
happy
families. I'm just loving life.

16:46.300 --> 16:49.400
The fact that Joel's noticed
this
is such a good sign.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.933
And I do think that Sam
could be good for Chloe

16:52.000 --> 16:53.733
if she lets him make her happy.

17:02.900 --> 17:05.933
Things do seem to be going well
with Chloe and Sam tonight.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.700
But Nathan's right. We need to
help
her forget how her exes treated
her

17:09.767 --> 17:11.599
if she's going to move forward.

17:15.567 --> 17:19.133
Tonight has been the best family
night and everyone is on a high.

17:19.200 --> 17:22.500
And now it's time to get back
to the house and carry on the
party.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.300
I love tonight and I love my
family.

17:27.300 --> 17:29.433
I'll do the alphabet.
Get off my hand.

17:29.500 --> 17:32.000
D, A, B, C, D.
That got to do with anything?

17:32.067 --> 17:35.267
A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
Do it on the clit, innit, man?

17:35.333 --> 17:37.500
Right, that is disgusting.

17:37.567 --> 17:40.800
Joel talking about performing
the alphabet on the clitoris

17:40.867 --> 17:43.200
is not helping
with my sexual frustration.

17:43.267 --> 17:45.833
I can't wait to get to the house
for some action.

17:45.900 --> 17:47.367
(high-pitched laugh)

17:50.567 --> 17:52.767
(yelling)

17:52.833 --> 17:54.800
Get away from my bag of chips!

17:54.867 --> 17:56.967
We've got back from a mint night
out

17:57.033 --> 17:59.167
and I want to spread the love
further.

17:59.233 --> 18:01.733
Shall we say what we love
about each other?

18:01.800 --> 18:04.867
I love you guys cos you've
welcomed us into this family.

18:04.933 --> 18:06.900
I love this fucking family,
yeah?

18:06.967 --> 18:11.267
Cos every time I come here,
you get me fucked up, yeah?

18:11.333 --> 18:13.733
I like how good you are
at blow jobs.

18:13.800 --> 18:17.733
Go on, Chloe! Remember you used
to be shit? I taught you well.

18:17.800 --> 18:21.367
I literally love this
fucked-up family. To the family!

18:21.433 --> 18:23.567
(all) To the family!

18:23.633 --> 18:27.033
All these loving vibes are
making me
want to make love.

18:27.100 --> 18:30.300
Howay, Sam. We're going
to the bathroom for a quickie.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.467
Oh, I can taste it!
The garlic.

18:34.533 --> 18:38.500
Garlic breath. Chloe, you need
to sort that out before we neck
on.

18:39.533 --> 18:41.067
(laughs) That's dead cute.

18:41.133 --> 18:44.233
Fucking hell. I've got stinky
breath
and I need a wee-wee.

18:44.300 --> 18:46.133
This quickie has to waitie.

18:49.100 --> 18:50.467
We're locked in.

18:50.533 --> 18:51.567
Oh, shit.

18:51.633 --> 18:53.867
Nathan! We're stuck!

18:53.933 --> 18:56.400
You actually hear them
shouting help?

18:56.467 --> 18:59.300
What do you want?
The door's locked!

18:59.367 --> 19:00.700
(shouts) Hello!

19:00.767 --> 19:04.567
I'm supposed to be banging
Chloe,
not banging the window for help.

19:04.633 --> 19:08.767
Oh, I'm really sorry, I'm really
tired. I've got to go bed.

19:08.833 --> 19:12.267
If yous want to sneak off and
have
hanky-panky and get locked out,

19:12.333 --> 19:14.167
it's on you. I'm not helping
yous.

19:14.233 --> 19:19.267
Everyone's actually going to
bed.
Look, (indistinct).

19:19.333 --> 19:21.133
I'm getting claustrophobia!

19:21.200 --> 19:23.533
Gonna piss myself.
I have to smash a window.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.867
That's the wrong way.
No wonder we're locked in.

19:26.933 --> 19:32.333
OK, guys, enough of your
banging.
Super Nathan to the rescue.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.967
Yay!
Nathan!

19:35.033 --> 19:37.833
You've just closed the fucking
door!
What?

19:37.900 --> 19:39.267
We're locked in!

19:40.500 --> 19:42.067
Oh, shit.

19:42.133 --> 19:43.200
Help!

19:43.267 --> 19:45.367
We're sleeping in here.
No, I'm not.

19:45.433 --> 19:48.233
You're not trapped
in a fucking outside spot.

19:48.300 --> 19:51.900
Joel, come in.
(laughter)

19:51.967 --> 19:54.467
What's the problem?
(laughter)

19:54.533 --> 19:56.867
What's the problem?
We're locked in. What?

19:56.933 --> 19:58.933
Steph, let them out, man.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
(cheering)

20:02.767 --> 20:06.400
Right, enough excitement.
I want to get Sam to fucking
bed.

20:07.700 --> 20:09.333
Neck it. One, two, three.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.733
I'm free and I've got Joel
drunk.

20:11.800 --> 20:12.967
Good luck, mate.

20:13.033 --> 20:14.933
I'm feeling very mischievous.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.700
That looks like it wants
pushing over.

20:21.100 --> 20:22.133
(screams)

20:23.433 --> 20:25.500
Fuck! I nearly killed Joel.

20:26.733 --> 20:28.033
What the fuck happened?

20:28.100 --> 20:30.933
No-one's seen it,
no-one knows what happened.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.233
It was Joel!
Right!

20:33.300 --> 20:35.500
He was like, "Fuck it, man.
Allow it."

20:35.567 --> 20:38.800
I just heard a loud noise.
Joel, what the fuck have you
done?

20:38.867 --> 20:43.133
Nathan is a bad influence on my
lad.
He's gonna be fit for nothing.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.533
Cheers, Nathan.

20:44.600 --> 20:47.733
Just trashed the house. Get out!
(laughter)

20:47.800 --> 20:51.833
Tonight has been hilarious.
Aaron and Marnie would've loved
it.

20:51.900 --> 20:53.067
They've missed out.

20:53.133 --> 20:55.700
I cannot believe what just
happened.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.900
I'm really, really hot.

21:00.967 --> 21:04.067
I can't believe it. I was so
glad
that Joel was here

21:04.133 --> 21:07.367
because I was gonna be able
to relieve my sexual
frustration,

21:07.433 --> 21:09.867
but now
he's got his head in a bucket.

21:09.933 --> 21:11.767
(retches)

21:11.833 --> 21:14.600
Oh, my God,
I'm gonna be sick at the stink.

21:23.900 --> 21:25.233
Yes!

21:25.967 --> 21:27.233
Oh, my God!

21:27.300 --> 21:30.667
Why can't my balls behave
themselves
and stay in my pants?

21:30.733 --> 21:34.233
I can feel all the negative
energy
oozing out of us like a shit.

21:34.300 --> 21:37.000
The door flies open.
(cheering)

21:42.467 --> 21:42.667
.

21:45.200 --> 21:45.400
.

21:57.500 --> 22:00.033
Hello.
I actually really enjoyed last
night.

22:00.100 --> 22:02.400
Same. One of the best nights
ever.

22:02.467 --> 22:05.600
Last night was amazing.
There was no kick-offs or drama.

22:05.667 --> 22:07.467
I want every night to be like
that.

22:07.533 --> 22:10.533
Joel must have been the drunkest
man
in the northeast.

22:10.600 --> 22:14.133
Don't know if Sophie and Joel
had
sex and I feel I'm partly to
blame

22:14.200 --> 22:15.767
cos I was making Joel drink.

22:15.833 --> 22:18.500
If Sophie and Joel did not have
sex
last night

22:18.567 --> 22:23.533
I feel so sorry for Sophie.
She is more hornier than a
rhino.

22:23.600 --> 22:25.300
They could be having sex now.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.333
You stink of sick.

22:30.400 --> 22:32.467
I know. It's up my nose
and everything.

22:32.533 --> 22:34.167
We didn't even have sex.

22:35.333 --> 22:37.033
Think I'd rather not.

22:37.100 --> 22:39.433
I can't believe I didn't get
any action.

22:39.500 --> 22:42.900
But after seeing Joel spew
his ring up, the last thing I
want

22:42.967 --> 22:44.967
is to have morning sex. Ugh.

22:45.033 --> 22:48.533
Nathan seen you naked more than
I have in the past 24 hours.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.567
You were in the shower with him,
you got drunk together.

22:51.633 --> 22:53.700
Name anything you did with me.

22:53.767 --> 22:56.400
You rubbing my back
when I was being sick, I think.

22:59.933 --> 23:02.033
Fucking hell.

23:02.100 --> 23:05.233
The place is a mess
and we feel a mess.

23:05.300 --> 23:08.433
Brekkie is the only thing that
will sort us out right now.

23:08.500 --> 23:11.000
Abbie, you need to put the hob
on.
Oh.

23:11.067 --> 23:12.867
You ever cooked bacon before?

23:12.933 --> 23:14.700
Hello, shaggers!

23:14.767 --> 23:18.233
Sophie, did you have sex or not?
No. Thanks to you, Nathan.

23:18.300 --> 23:20.033
Cockblock, ey!

23:20.100 --> 23:21.933
Joel needs to man the fuck up.

23:22.033 --> 23:25.433
Everyone's been sick and then
had sex. It's the fashion.

23:25.500 --> 23:27.733
You've had him for years. Come
on.
True.

23:27.800 --> 23:29.733
Always nice seeing you.
Excuse me.

23:29.800 --> 23:32.000
But we'll save it
for when I get home now.

23:32.067 --> 23:35.967
Shit. Now that I'm sober,
I do feel bad for Sophie.

23:36.033 --> 23:39.167
Cos if my boyfriend came
to this house and I didn't get
any

23:39.233 --> 23:42.000
I'd be pissed off. Soz, Soph.

23:42.067 --> 23:43.200
(all) Bye!

23:43.267 --> 23:44.900
Love you very much.

23:44.967 --> 23:47.833
Joel's gone and I still feel
a lot of sexual tension.

23:47.900 --> 23:51.900
I need to rid of all the bad
energy,
so I've got a plan.

23:51.967 --> 23:55.400
I need someone to come in
and heal us from the inside out.

23:55.467 --> 23:58.233
I need Reiki.
What do you mean? I'm confused.

23:58.300 --> 24:00.933
You need Reiki cos you've
got negative energy.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.633
What the fuck is Reiki? The only
rake
I know is a garden tool

24:05.700 --> 24:07.567
and am I fuck going gardening.

24:07.633 --> 24:11.333
They heal you so you can get,
like,
rid of all the negative energy.

24:11.400 --> 24:12.667
Your chakras, isn't it?

24:12.733 --> 24:15.200
Yeah, chakras.
You've got negative energy.

24:15.267 --> 24:19.267
When it comes to men, Chloe's
always
been given a lot of negative
energy.

24:19.333 --> 24:22.133
This is gonna make her a new
woman.

24:22.200 --> 24:24.067
Demons inside you.
I'll do it.

24:24.133 --> 24:26.500
I want this too.
You're spiritual like me.

24:26.567 --> 24:27.967
This is right up my street.

24:28.033 --> 24:30.933
I've been wanting to do
something
like this for ages.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.333
I've got a woman, Jackie.
I'll ring her.

24:33.400 --> 24:37.367
I fancy doing something fun
today,
so I think we should go
shredding.

24:37.433 --> 24:39.033
What's that?
Shredding?

24:39.100 --> 24:41.633
Shredding? Do I look like
a fucking secretary?

24:41.700 --> 24:43.733
All I'm gonna say is, wrap up
warm.

24:43.800 --> 24:48.400
Right, yous. Jackie's on her
way.
No. I'm so excited.

24:48.467 --> 24:51.933
We should go and get ready.
Shredding. Shredding.

24:54.267 --> 24:57.667
I've got no idea what shredding
is
but I'm happy to be getting out

24:57.733 --> 25:00.533
of the house while Chloe rids
herself
of her demons.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.433
See yous later, love yous! Bye!

25:03.567 --> 25:05.633
Getting possessed, like an
exorcism?

25:05.700 --> 25:08.367
You know, you've been fucked
around
by lads?

25:08.433 --> 25:10.767
You're very negative.
They can heal you.

25:10.833 --> 25:14.267
Me and Sam get on well. There's
always something holding us
back.

25:14.333 --> 25:16.833
I really hope this Reiki lady
can sort me out,

25:16.900 --> 25:19.467
cos I want to move forward with
Sam,
but I can't,

25:19.533 --> 25:23.100
cos I keep bringing up my past
and the way Marty's made us
feel.

25:25.467 --> 25:28.633
We arrive and I don't know
what's
going on with this weather,

25:28.700 --> 25:31.033
but it looks like
the end of the world.

25:31.100 --> 25:34.100
Feel like we're on the set
of a fucking horror film.

25:34.167 --> 25:36.067
So we have to ride about on
that?

25:36.133 --> 25:38.400
Looks like a lawnmower
with an engine.

25:38.467 --> 25:44.133
On a scale of one to safe, ten
being
super safe, zero highly
dangerous.

25:44.200 --> 25:47.367
Ten out of ten. I feel
my competition streak's coming
out.

25:47.433 --> 25:50.033
If I know I'm not going to die
or break any bones,

25:50.100 --> 25:51.633
I'm going to go quite fast.

25:51.700 --> 25:55.000
The competition is on
and I feel like a superhero

25:55.067 --> 25:57.867
with this protective equipment
on.
(grunts)

25:59.167 --> 26:00.867
Ah, you bastards!
Do it again.

26:00.933 --> 26:05.000
If anybody's gonna be good, it's
gonna be me, so I wanna go
first.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.233
(shouts)

26:10.133 --> 26:12.000
Oh, my God!

26:12.067 --> 26:13.933
That didn't go as I expected.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.300
You said people don't fall off!
Normal people don't.

26:19.867 --> 26:21.933
You're giving me fear by being
shit.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.433
I thought I wasn't gonna fall
off,
but now I'm actually scared.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.333
Abbie, you can go next.

26:28.733 --> 26:30.600
Go on!
Oh, my God, I don't like it.

26:30.667 --> 26:32.233
(screams)
(both laugh)

26:32.300 --> 26:33.667
(screams)

26:33.733 --> 26:37.033
Abbie did all right. You would
when you go two mile an hour.

26:37.100 --> 26:39.533
(farts) Nathan!
It was a nervous fart.

26:39.600 --> 26:42.567
OK. It's time to face the fear.

26:44.400 --> 26:47.333
Nathan's bouncing round
like a little bunny rabbit.

26:47.400 --> 26:49.000
Stop being a pussy, Nathan.

26:49.067 --> 26:50.767
Fast as you can, Nathan!

26:54.833 --> 26:56.133
(laughter)

26:56.200 --> 26:59.300
You know you've got a hole
in your joggers?

26:59.367 --> 27:02.367
What the hell is going on?
That's twice now.

27:02.433 --> 27:05.700
Why can't my balls behave
themselves
and stay in my pants?

27:05.767 --> 27:07.800
How did that happen?

27:07.867 --> 27:11.900
Think it's about time that we
had a
race cos I know that I'm gonna
win.

27:13.633 --> 27:14.733
(screams)

27:20.500 --> 27:21.667
(shouting)

27:25.300 --> 27:27.667
Oh, my God! Guess who won.

27:27.733 --> 27:30.633
Me! Me! Me! Me!

27:30.700 --> 27:32.800
Oh! Put that in your pipe
and smoke it.

27:32.867 --> 27:36.567
How the fuck did I come last?
Those two were shit.

27:36.633 --> 27:40.900
Look sad. Right, three, two,
one.
Yes! Yes!

27:40.967 --> 27:43.333
Wow. Sam really is a sore loser.

27:43.400 --> 27:44.933
Let's get back to the house

27:45.000 --> 27:48.033
and see if the girls are in
a more Zen place than Sam is.

27:50.633 --> 27:53.333
Jackie's arrived to perform
some Reiki on us.

27:53.400 --> 27:57.433
I need my sexual frustrations
relieving. If this doesn't work,

27:57.500 --> 27:59.333
I'm gonna end up shagging
Nathan.

28:02.700 --> 28:05.200
You might feel some warmth.

28:05.267 --> 28:07.833
This is the most I've been
touched
in a while.

28:07.900 --> 28:12.833
I can feel the bubble. I can
feel
my vagina getting really wet.

28:12.900 --> 28:15.733
I think I could have an orgasm
just lying here.

28:15.800 --> 28:19.233
That's got nothing to do with
me.
(laughs)

28:19.300 --> 28:21.633
Well, this has clearly worked
for Sophie.

28:21.700 --> 28:25.067
So move over, cos it's my turn
to feel the positivity.

28:27.100 --> 28:30.500
Steph said that she's very
spiritual. She is not spiritual.

28:30.567 --> 28:32.167
She is fucking asleep!

28:32.233 --> 28:35.400
I'm just going to get this one.
What's just happened there?

28:35.467 --> 28:38.633
Now it's Chloe's turn,
but there's so many demons to
expel

28:38.700 --> 28:41.367
that it's like
three witches round a cauldron.

28:41.433 --> 28:44.000
I can feel it.

28:44.067 --> 28:48.133
I can feel all the negative
energy
of my ex-boyfriends oozing out
of us

28:48.200 --> 28:50.100
a little bit like a shit.

28:50.167 --> 28:51.400
(sings) Aah!

28:51.467 --> 28:54.233
Do you feel like Marty's left
you?
Yeah.

28:54.300 --> 28:55.733
He's gone?
Gone.

28:55.800 --> 28:58.967
And you're letting the new
energy,
which is Sam, in.

29:00.033 --> 29:02.167
(sobs)

29:02.233 --> 29:06.833
This is actually really working.
I feel so much emotion right now

29:06.900 --> 29:08.267
I could cry a river.

29:08.333 --> 29:11.167
I'm scared. The way I've been
treated in the past,

29:11.233 --> 29:13.833
I think that Sam's gonna do that
to us as well.

29:13.900 --> 29:16.867
You've got to accept
that he's gonna treat you right.

29:16.933 --> 29:19.933
Now I'm a step forward,
I can believe that he means it.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.700
Considering I didn't have a clue
what Reiki was,

29:22.767 --> 29:26.433
I certainly do now. And I will
never
cry over Marty ever again.

29:26.500 --> 29:28.367
Sam, I'm ready for you.

29:33.800 --> 29:35.433
(chanting)

29:36.700 --> 29:40.133
All three of us feel calm,
refreshed and positive.

29:40.200 --> 29:43.333
I just hope the other guys
don't come in and ruin our vibe.

29:43.400 --> 29:45.000
(chanting)

29:45.067 --> 29:48.500
The girls seem very Zen.
This is good news for Sam

29:48.567 --> 29:50.867
cos it means he won't
get his head kicked in.

29:50.933 --> 29:53.233
We should get ready for the
night
so move it.

29:53.300 --> 29:55.200
You're not going out.
Yes, I am.

29:55.267 --> 29:58.833
Excuse me, get your DIY tools
out.
It was Joel. It was Joel.

29:58.900 --> 30:02.167
Before I get ready for the
night,
I want to cosy up with Sam

30:02.233 --> 30:05.400
and tell him how I feel
after my intense Reiki session.

30:05.467 --> 30:07.533
Have you been crying?
All day.

30:07.600 --> 30:09.967
I feel it's got rid
of all the negativity.

30:10.033 --> 30:14.033
From my past relationship and
stuff.
I can move on with something
new.

30:14.100 --> 30:16.367
Yeah. Know what I mean?
I know, yeah.

30:16.433 --> 30:19.400
I'm glad for Chloe
that she's over these bad
feelings

30:19.467 --> 30:22.667
but also for me because I hate
being compared to her exes.

30:22.733 --> 30:26.333
Think trust is very important
and if you can't trust people
because

30:26.400 --> 30:30.233
you're thinking of other stuff,
then obviously that can affect
stuff.

30:30.300 --> 30:32.900
Me and Sam are in
the best place ever.

30:32.967 --> 30:35.733
I honestly can say
that I 100% trust Sam

30:35.800 --> 30:38.533
and know for a fine fact
he will not fuck up.

30:38.600 --> 30:41.400
I have missed you.
I've missed you a little tiny
bit.

30:41.467 --> 30:43.767
How much out of ten?
Two, but don't tell.

30:43.833 --> 30:46.833
Two? That fucking it?
That's how much you miss your
dog.

30:46.900 --> 30:50.233
No, I miss the dog about seven.
Fuck! Is that a joke?

30:54.367 --> 30:57.800
Us girls are feeling very Zen'd
out.

30:57.867 --> 31:03.067
So we are ready for another
crazy night out on the Toon.

31:05.633 --> 31:10.133
Chloe's been crying all day
because
the energy's getting released.

31:10.200 --> 31:13.100
Sam. Only thing I would
suggest to that is please,

31:13.167 --> 31:15.433
do not say or do anything
stupid tonight.

31:15.500 --> 31:19.667
Nathan. When was the last time
I've
ever said or done something
stupid?

31:21.700 --> 31:24.967
Had two strikes at the minute.
This could be three strikes.

31:25.033 --> 31:26.067
Could be out.

31:26.133 --> 31:28.967
Just be a nice boy
cos you want her to be happy.

31:29.033 --> 31:31.933
Chloe is in a fragile state
today,
so if I was Sam,

31:32.000 --> 31:35.533
I'd keep his mouth closed
so he doesn't fuck anything up.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.833
(both) Right, let's go
and get a drink.

31:37.900 --> 31:40.567
Whoa! We're bonding too much.

31:40.633 --> 31:42.133
We're like brothers.

31:45.300 --> 31:48.133
I just want to say
I'm very excited for tonight.

31:48.200 --> 31:51.867
Now I've had the Reiki, I am
feeling
like I've got a new body.

31:51.933 --> 31:53.200
That's what I like.

31:53.267 --> 31:56.267
Reiki sounds like it's done
the girls a world of good.

31:56.333 --> 32:00.267
Especially Chloe. So hopefully
now
there'll be no more kick-offs.

32:00.333 --> 32:03.067
Like, there's a lot of positive
vibes in the room.

32:03.133 --> 32:06.333
I'm really enjoying it.
Want us to teach you something?

32:06.400 --> 32:08.467
Right. (chants)

32:08.533 --> 32:10.533
(all join in)

32:12.767 --> 32:14.267
Come on, Abbie, join in.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.867
(all chanting)

32:16.933 --> 32:18.900
(chants)

32:18.967 --> 32:21.600
Feel better?
So much better.

32:23.967 --> 32:28.333
Come on, you Reiki radgy
bastards.
Get your shots in, girls.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.600
Oh, my God, your pussy stinks.

32:30.667 --> 32:32.567
Everyone seems in such a good
mood.

32:32.633 --> 32:35.233
It just makes us more excited
to get to that club.

32:35.300 --> 32:38.833
Our toast tonight is to have
a night exactly like last night.

32:38.900 --> 32:41.700
No kick-offs, get absolutely
fucking mortal again.

32:41.767 --> 32:44.133
(cheering)

32:46.400 --> 32:48.667
Wow! That really hit my brain
fast.

32:48.733 --> 32:50.333
I'm buzzing for tonight.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.800
And then the door flies open.

32:53.800 --> 32:55.100
We...

32:56.700 --> 32:58.767
(cheering)
Aaron! Aaron!

32:58.833 --> 33:00.733
Howay, you radgies. I'm back.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.467
(cheering)

33:07.133 --> 33:10.233
Steph flirting with Aaron
just because Marnie isn't here.

33:10.300 --> 33:11.867
He's fucking laughing at us!

33:11.933 --> 33:13.533
I am so fucking angry.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.233
Stop, stop, stop.

33:15.300 --> 33:16.533
This is fucked now.

33:21.933 --> 33:22.133
.

33:24.667 --> 33:24.867
.

33:35.700 --> 33:36.867
Aaron!
(cheering)

33:36.933 --> 33:38.600
Where you been?

33:38.667 --> 33:42.600
Yes! Aaron is back.
It's so good to see you.

33:42.667 --> 33:45.300
We got Aaron! Where you been?
On a mission.

33:45.367 --> 33:47.833
We had no idea when Aaron
was coming back.

33:47.900 --> 33:50.433
But I'm so fucking glad to see
him.

33:50.500 --> 33:51.500
Where you been?

33:51.567 --> 33:54.467
Well, I wasn't allowed back.
Don't look at me!

33:54.533 --> 33:55.733
I'm not gonna lie,

33:55.800 --> 33:59.000
I'm fucking buzzing to be back
amongst all these radgies.

33:59.067 --> 34:01.533
So where's Marns?
She's still not here.

34:01.600 --> 34:04.733
I thought she'd be with you.
She would have seen Casey.

34:04.800 --> 34:07.067
Might have gone home
after the party.

34:07.133 --> 34:09.199
I just hope that Marnie and
Casey
are OK

34:09.266 --> 34:11.933
and that she does
actually come back. I miss her.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.800
You're just in time because
we're going out as well.

34:14.867 --> 34:16.900
Down your drink!
Cheers!

34:18.167 --> 34:19.667
Let's go!
Let's go!

34:19.733 --> 34:23.800
Marnie might not be here, but
let's
get to the Toon and get smashed.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.266
We get to the club, the music's
bouncing and Aaron's back.

34:41.333 --> 34:44.100
Tonight is gonna be fucking
awesome!

34:48.667 --> 34:52.100
I'm having such a good night now
that my negative tension's gone.

34:52.167 --> 34:53.600
And we've got Aaron back.

34:59.200 --> 35:02.300
It's so fucking nice to be back
and since I've been away,

35:02.367 --> 35:03.800
I've had time to think.

35:03.867 --> 35:06.967
And my behaviour towards Nathan
was fucking disgusting.

35:15.900 --> 35:19.233
I'm so glad Nathan isn't holding
a grudge. Being in the house

35:19.300 --> 35:23.300
with Marnie when we're both in
relationships was really
difficult

35:23.367 --> 35:25.667
cos I still care about her so
much
as a mate.

35:37.267 --> 35:39.600
Of course it's weird
for Aaron and Marnie.

35:39.667 --> 35:42.533
They're always gonna have
a soft spot for each other.

35:42.600 --> 35:45.800
They need to work out how to be
around each other in the house.

35:58.533 --> 36:00.467
I do really hope Marnie comes
back.

36:00.533 --> 36:03.733
If she does I'm gonna do my best
to make it work as friends.

36:07.833 --> 36:11.067
I love that Aaron is back
and he is looking hot.

36:11.133 --> 36:13.900
It's nice to have a bit of eye
candy
in the house again.

36:21.067 --> 36:25.033
I'm having the best night ever.
That Reiki has sorted me right
out.

36:25.100 --> 36:28.167
Aaron's back, me and Sam
are getting on better than ever.

36:28.233 --> 36:29.500
I am so happy right now.

36:42.933 --> 36:46.300
When Marnie was in the house,
I never got to speak to Aaron.

36:46.367 --> 36:49.167
So it's great that I've got
that chance to do it now.

36:57.867 --> 37:00.667
I look over and I can see Steph
flirting with Aaron.

37:00.733 --> 37:04.300
She's wasting no time
just because Marnie isn't here.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.700
It's nice to talk to Steph

37:10.767 --> 37:13.367
but sorry, darling,
I'm still in a relationship.

37:22.900 --> 37:26.667
So Aaron's still just friends
with
Marnie and still has a
girlfriend.

37:26.733 --> 37:30.300
It was worth a try and it's
always
good to know where a girl
stands.

37:37.233 --> 37:40.233
As much as I love Nathan,
it's so good to have Aaron back.

37:40.300 --> 37:42.767
Tonight is mint.
Let's get some more drinks in.

37:47.967 --> 37:51.667
I look over and I can see Sam
at the bar talking to another
girl.

37:51.733 --> 37:53.800
Mate, Chloe is sat right there.

37:57.667 --> 37:59.700
What the fuck's Sam doing?

38:01.667 --> 38:05.600
Hang on a minute, five minutes
ago I
was the happiest girl I've ever
been

38:05.667 --> 38:09.433
and now I'm watching Sam flirt
with
another girl. Is this a joke?

38:11.333 --> 38:14.333
What the hell?
He's still fucking talking to
her.

38:16.133 --> 38:19.367
Oh, fuck. Chloe's gonna
kick off in a minute.

38:19.433 --> 38:21.767
And we just got rid of her
demons.

38:29.467 --> 38:33.067
Chloe, what the fuck? I was just
talking to that girl. That's
all.

38:47.600 --> 38:51.467
That is bullshit. I thought
Sam was different, but he's not.

38:51.533 --> 38:53.667
Once again,
a lad has fucked us over.

38:53.733 --> 38:56.000
I've had enough of this,
I'm going home.

39:10.267 --> 39:13.900
Tonight's gone tits up. Chloe
must have stormed out for a
reason

39:13.967 --> 39:16.400
and if he was even talking
to another girl,

39:16.467 --> 39:18.133
that's bad enough in my eyes.

39:22.133 --> 39:25.400
Let's just get Chloe back
to the house before she kicks
off.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.767
When you're there?

39:33.100 --> 39:34.167
He's not.

39:34.233 --> 39:37.700
Sam is technically still single,
but if he wants to be that
single

39:37.767 --> 39:39.567
he shouldn't be leading Chloe
on.

39:39.633 --> 39:42.967
When you get back, I think
you just need to keep your cool.

39:43.033 --> 39:45.533
Chloe's lost her head.

39:45.600 --> 39:48.967
You talked to another girl
when you told Chloe you wouldn't
go

39:49.033 --> 39:51.867
and talk with other girls.
So you have fucked up.

39:51.933 --> 39:54.300
For fuck's sake,
I was just having a laugh.

39:54.367 --> 39:58.167
I wasn't actually gonna do
anything.
What's everyone's problem?

40:00.567 --> 40:01.967
Put your hands up.

40:02.033 --> 40:04.067
We get back to the house,
and the vibe

40:04.133 --> 40:06.367
couldn't be more different
to last night.

40:06.433 --> 40:09.700
I feel so bad for Chloe.
This is awkward.

40:09.767 --> 40:12.000
I was being cute tonight.
I did nothing.

40:12.067 --> 40:14.667
I've only got eyes for Chloe.
Do you, though?

40:14.733 --> 40:16.467
I know that girl.
Do you fuck.

40:16.533 --> 40:20.767
She is from where I'm from.
I'm from the same place as you.

40:20.833 --> 40:23.100
I feel like
I'm in an interrogation room.

40:23.167 --> 40:26.500
I was only talking to that girl.
Anyway, I'm still single.

40:26.567 --> 40:29.133
I'm not in a relationship.
All right, OK.

40:29.200 --> 40:31.400
What? I know we're not
in a relationship,

40:31.467 --> 40:35.067
but I did think we're going to
be
soon. Why do men treat us like
this?

40:35.133 --> 40:37.467
I trying to enjoy my cheesy chip
and I can't

40:37.533 --> 40:41.533
cos the lies in the air.
Everyone thinks you're
embarrassing.

40:41.600 --> 40:46.167
Fucking hell, so much for that
Reiki.
We need to get Chloe straight to
bed.

40:46.233 --> 40:49.033
Who is that?
Who is that person downstairs?

40:49.100 --> 40:52.633
I had strong hopes for Sam.
I thought he was different.

40:52.700 --> 40:55.967
But after tonight,
he's just another one of them.

40:56.033 --> 40:59.633
It seems he's acting like a lad
just because Aaron's back.

40:59.700 --> 41:02.200
You were in the plain fucking
wrong.
How?

41:02.267 --> 41:04.033
Sam, you've got so much to
learn.

41:04.100 --> 41:07.267
When you get with a girl
in this house, you're off
limits.

41:07.333 --> 41:10.900
I am not in a relationship.
Chloe, stop acting like a
psycho.

41:10.967 --> 41:14.500
Girl said, "I want to come
back,"
what would you say? Not tonight.

41:14.567 --> 41:18.033
What the fuck did Sam just say?
I'm gonna lose my shit soon,
like.

41:18.100 --> 41:22.367
Well, if we wanna
talk about the truth.

41:22.433 --> 41:25.667
Cos your cock's that small,
the dick very mushroom-like.

41:25.733 --> 41:28.567
I have had better orgasms
from my fucking finger!

41:28.633 --> 41:33.267
Fucking hell. Why is Chloe so
angry?
This whole situation is
laughable.

41:38.467 --> 41:41.300
God!
Laughing when she's this pissed
off

41:41.367 --> 41:45.300
is like waving a red flag to a
bull.
You are asking for disaster.

41:45.367 --> 41:48.733
I thought you were going to bed.
We're done. Chakras.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.800
(laughs)
Why is he laughing?

41:50.867 --> 41:54.400
I have literally seen red.
I am so fucking angry.

41:56.500 --> 42:00.467
Ding-ding! Chloe's bombing down
the
stairs. She means fucking
business.

42:02.367 --> 42:05.533
Chloe has just swung for me.
Have I upset her that much?

42:06.600 --> 42:09.333
Chloe!
He's fucking laughing at us!

42:09.400 --> 42:11.533
He's a man!
I am not laughing at Chloe.

42:11.600 --> 42:15.167
I'm laughing at the abuse she's
shouting at me and that she's
trying

42:15.233 --> 42:18.033
to attack me. It's laughing
or I'm going to kick off.

42:23.233 --> 42:26.233
This is fucked now.
Chloe, I need to take you to
bed.

42:26.300 --> 42:28.000
Chakras.
Swear to God...

42:28.067 --> 42:29.833
Listen, chakras. Chakras.

42:29.900 --> 42:32.433
Me and Chloe were
in such a good place.

42:32.500 --> 42:34.733
I just fucked up
and I don't know why.

42:35.767 --> 42:39.000
I think you need to go to bed.
Come on, it's going too far now.

42:39.067 --> 42:40.500
Poor Chloe.

42:43.300 --> 42:46.667
I can't believe my night started
so great to end like this.

42:46.733 --> 42:48.067
Cos I do like Sam so much,

42:48.133 --> 42:51.333
but I will not get fucked over
by another boy again.

42:53.100 --> 42:55.733
Tonight has ended up
being a disaster.

42:55.800 --> 42:58.367
I think I just need to go to bed
away from everyone

42:58.433 --> 43:01.000
cos nothing is gonna get sorted
right now.

43:08.367 --> 43:12.600
Morning! You bunch of pissheads.
What the actual fuck? Marnie's
back.

43:12.667 --> 43:16.233
I feel like Sam has knocked us
down.
I can't be arsed with him.

43:16.300 --> 43:19.833
Chloe, your behaviour last night
was totally unacceptable.

43:19.900 --> 43:22.333
No drinking for you.
(cheering)

43:22.400 --> 43:24.267
Loads of cock in Edinburgh!

43:24.333 --> 43:26.767
Steph's already got
the bloody boxers off!

43:26.833 --> 43:29.567
That girl must be
gagging for some cock.

43:29.633 --> 43:31.167
(screaming)

43:34.833 --> 43:38.033
Me boyfriend's not here.
Does that really matter?

43:39.633 --> 43:41.800
Don't dare bring my boyfriend
into it.

43:41.867 --> 43:45.833
As a friend, you would never
have
brought that up! Fuck off!

44:12.433 --> 44:12.633
.
