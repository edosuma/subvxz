00:14.710 --> 00:17.234

Together with the FBI

00:20.672 --> 00:23.371
<i>Manhattan SVU,

00:23.371 --> 00:25.242

00:26.765 --> 00:30.726
<i>behind the revenge crime
website Shadowerk.</i>

00:30.726 --> 00:33.294
You can't take down the site
until you know who built it.

00:33.294 --> 00:35.296
We have a name.
Hyakunin Giri.

00:35.296 --> 00:38.386
Server's located
in Dublin, Ohio.

00:38.386 --> 00:41.606
We're waiting on a warrant
for physical surveillance.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.741
<i>This could be our perp.</i>

00:45.741 --> 00:47.047
We gotta move. Move in!

00:47.047 --> 00:50.006
<i>FBI. Set it down.</i>

00:50.006 --> 00:51.268
We got a problem.

00:51.268 --> 00:52.574
<i>The site's back up,</i>

00:52.574 --> 00:54.837
and there's something
you should probably see.

00:54.837 --> 00:57.796
A $50,000 bounty
on each of our heads.

00:57.796 --> 00:59.233

01:39.838 --> 01:41.753
You sure you don't
wanna go to Grandma's?

01:41.753 --> 01:43.451
Gotta finish this.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.372
Are you just gonna code
by yourself all day, honey?

01:52.721 --> 01:54.331
Maybe I'll get
something to eat.

01:54.331 --> 01:56.768
You don't have a car.

01:56.768 --> 01:58.292
I'll figure it out.

02:39.681 --> 02:41.204

Why you all alone
on Christmas?

02:56.306 --> 02:58.569
I just got back
from overseas.

03:01.137 --> 03:03.008
I work for the government.

03:03.008 --> 03:05.228
Yeah?

03:05.228 --> 03:06.708
Doing what?

03:08.710 --> 03:10.190
Can't really talk about that.

03:15.804 --> 03:18.241
What are you doing alone
on Christmas?

03:18.241 --> 03:19.851
Oh.

03:19.851 --> 03:24.595
My boyfriend's family,
they live up in North Dakota.

03:24.595 --> 03:26.902
I went there last year,

03:26.902 --> 03:29.121
but they were kinda racist.

03:29.121 --> 03:32.995
And I just didn't feel like
dealing with that again.

03:32.995 --> 03:37.652
If I was him,
I'd be with you, not them.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.702
You wanna celebrate Christmas
with me?

03:58.063 --> 04:00.327
You have any friends, Kyle?

04:02.459 --> 04:05.375
You've met the people
in this town.

04:05.375 --> 04:06.811
They're so normal.

04:08.683 --> 04:11.294
You make it
sound like that's a bad thing.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.384
They're all liars.

04:16.908 --> 04:18.649
The worst part is,

04:18.649 --> 04:20.956
no one's gonna give a crap
when they all die.

04:28.006 --> 04:29.269
Okay.

04:31.358 --> 04:32.924
Can I get you two
anything else?

04:32.924 --> 04:34.274
No.

04:37.451 --> 04:39.104
Oh, no,
you don't have to do that.

04:39.104 --> 04:41.455
I want to.

04:41.455 --> 04:42.847
You've been nice.

04:45.372 --> 04:48.636
Well, thanks for lunch.

04:51.595 --> 04:54.294
What are you gonna do with
the rest of your Christmas?

04:59.168 --> 05:00.517
Go home.

05:02.084 --> 05:03.607
I'm working on something.

05:06.218 --> 05:08.351
It's gonna change the world.

05:08.351 --> 05:11.093
Really?

05:11.093 --> 05:13.269
How's it gonna do that?

05:13.269 --> 05:16.185
By showing people the truth.

05:16.185 --> 05:18.230
About who they really are.

05:20.145 --> 05:21.451
Wow.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.369
Okay.

05:34.464 --> 05:35.683
<i>Mom.</i>

05:35.683 --> 05:37.293
<i>I'm sorry that
I left a surprise</i>

05:37.293 --> 05:39.513
<i>waiting for you on Christmas.</i>

05:39.513 --> 05:42.603
<i>But I don't want you
to be sad, okay?</i>

05:42.603 --> 05:45.519
<i>Because there's nothing
you could have done.</i>

05:45.519 --> 05:49.566
<i>I know you think
I have a lot of problems.</i>

05:49.566 --> 05:52.090
<i>But those problems
don't really belong to me.</i>

05:54.615 --> 05:57.618
<i>The real problem
is with other people.</i>

06:00.229 --> 06:05.713
<i>I read somewhere that all pain
is one malady with many names.</i>

06:07.628 --> 06:10.021
<i>And I think I know
what those names are.</i>

06:15.853 --> 06:18.943
<i>They're the names
of everyone in the world.</i>

08:12.579 --> 08:14.276
Talk to us.
How come the site's back up?

08:14.276 --> 08:16.713
I thought we'd confiscated
the server.

08:16.713 --> 08:19.586
<i>The one in Ohio,
but from what I can tell,</i>

08:19.586 --> 08:20.717
<i>it looks like
he's mirroring it.</i>

08:20.717 --> 08:21.718
<i>Well then where
the hell is it?</i>

08:21.718 --> 08:22.719
<i>We'll get a warrant.</i>

08:22.719 --> 08:24.112
For the entire globe?

08:24.112 --> 08:27.028
He's using proxies, now,
and encryption.

08:27.028 --> 08:29.639
So we just forced this guy
to burrow deeper underground?

08:29.639 --> 08:30.945
Pretty much, yeah.

08:30.945 --> 08:32.903
How do we stop
more people from dying?

08:32.903 --> 08:35.515
<i>We don't.
Not until we find this guy.</i>

08:35.515 --> 08:37.604
<i>In the meantime,
somebody in the Escrow office</i>

08:37.604 --> 08:39.649
<i>has to know who's
behind all this.</i>

08:39.649 --> 08:41.651
<i>What about that IT guy
you arrested?</i>

08:41.651 --> 08:44.654
Jacob Bettencourt.
We're talking to him now.

08:44.654 --> 08:46.482
<i>You recognize the number,
right?</i>

08:46.482 --> 08:48.658
I...

08:48.658 --> 08:50.007
Yeah, the last call I got.

08:50.007 --> 08:52.183
From whoever set up
the IT appointment?

08:52.183 --> 08:53.663
Yeah.

08:53.663 --> 08:55.535
What'd they want you
to do with the server?

08:55.535 --> 08:56.753
Replace it.

08:56.753 --> 08:59.364
Then toss it in the trash.

08:59.364 --> 09:01.584
So he could put the site
back up on a clean one.

09:01.584 --> 09:03.543
Uh--

09:03.543 --> 09:05.457
Describe the voice.
Man? Woman?

09:05.457 --> 09:06.937
Uh, it was--it was a guy.

09:06.937 --> 09:08.199
Okay. Did he say his name?

09:09.636 --> 09:10.898
Larry.

09:12.073 --> 09:13.596
Larry,
from the Escrow office.

09:13.596 --> 09:15.032
We already know
he didn't make the call.

09:15.032 --> 09:16.468
And whoever made
the call was lying.

09:16.468 --> 09:17.687
Any luck tracing the number?

09:17.687 --> 09:19.907
Nah.
Perp probably used a burner.

09:19.907 --> 09:21.778
We need to get more
from those Escrow employees

09:21.778 --> 09:23.606
before someone goes
for the bounty on your heads.

09:23.606 --> 09:24.825
Well, I'm not worried.

09:24.825 --> 09:26.348
This place is crawling
with Feds.

09:26.348 --> 09:28.568
All the same, you two
are barred from fieldwork

09:28.568 --> 09:31.179
until further notice.

09:31.179 --> 09:32.702
Well, we've lost
the element of surprise.

09:32.702 --> 09:34.661
Not to mention our anonymity.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.097
Next move?

09:36.097 --> 09:38.795
Start with the suspects
we do have.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.580
A murder-for-hire website?

09:40.580 --> 09:41.755
Is that even a thing?

09:41.755 --> 09:42.886
Well, it is now.

09:42.886 --> 09:44.584
And it's not just for murders.

09:44.584 --> 09:48.370
We already have five rape
victims in New York alone,

09:48.370 --> 09:51.025
and a few dozen more
in other countries.

09:51.025 --> 09:53.723
- This is horrifying.
- It is.

09:53.723 --> 09:55.072
That's why we need your help,
Mrs. Wilkie.

09:55.072 --> 09:56.726
I don't know anything
about that site.

09:56.726 --> 10:00.164
But Dublin Escrow
is your company, right?

10:00.164 --> 10:02.602
So who has access
to the computers?

10:04.429 --> 10:07.911
If it's anyone in our office,
it's Larry Wilcox.

10:07.911 --> 10:09.696
And what can you
tell us about him?

10:09.696 --> 10:12.089
He likes scratch-off tickets.

10:12.089 --> 10:13.482
Got a problem.

10:13.482 --> 10:16.006
He's in a financial hole.

10:18.966 --> 10:20.794
It's the Russians.

10:20.794 --> 10:24.624
You know about the troll farms
and the bots?

10:24.624 --> 10:26.843
They're the ones
that got Biden elected.

10:29.019 --> 10:32.196
This guy would be
very smart, tech savvy.

10:32.196 --> 10:34.329
Whoever this person is
is likely male,

10:34.329 --> 10:37.071
mid-20s, antisocial.

10:40.161 --> 10:42.467
Do you know anyone
who fits that description?

10:42.467 --> 10:44.426
No, not really.

10:44.426 --> 10:45.949
Well, maybe somebody
you don't suspect?

10:45.949 --> 10:47.647
I don't know
anyone like that.

10:49.779 --> 10:52.216
Got a sec?

10:52.216 --> 10:54.610
Turns out Linda Wilkie
has a son, Kyle.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.307
He's 26. No record.

10:56.307 --> 10:57.874
That's why we didn't
flag him before.

10:57.874 --> 10:59.310
Does he fit the profile?

10:59.310 --> 11:01.791
He's unemployed, single,
no social media presence.

11:01.791 --> 11:04.489
Taught coding at a summer
camp for the last five years.

11:04.489 --> 11:05.969
What does that tell you,
other than he has no friends?

11:05.969 --> 11:07.449
He's good at being anonymous.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.973
His last-known is his
mother's address in Dublin.

11:09.973 --> 11:12.759
And no wonder Linda
was being so defensive.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.499
A mother being protective
of her son.

11:14.499 --> 11:16.937
I'll get a warrant.

11:16.937 --> 11:18.808
It's not Kyle. You're wrong.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.723
Right now, the FBI
is headed to your house,

11:20.723 --> 11:21.985
so if you do know anything,

11:21.985 --> 11:23.291
it would be in your
best interest to tell us

11:23.291 --> 11:24.553
before they knock down
your door.

11:24.553 --> 11:26.076
It's not him, it's not!

11:26.076 --> 11:28.775
Mrs. Wilkie,
is your son home right now?

11:28.775 --> 11:30.428
No, we don't live
together anymore.

11:30.428 --> 11:33.127
Someone put a hit out
on Captain Benson and myself.

11:33.127 --> 11:35.042
There's a bounty
on our heads,

11:35.042 --> 11:38.219
and we think that Kyle
is the one that posted it.

11:38.219 --> 11:40.351
We think that this
is his website.

11:40.351 --> 11:41.918
That doesn't sound
like my Kyle.

11:41.918 --> 11:44.486
Well, sometimes people
aren't what they seem to be.

11:46.357 --> 11:47.489
Where is he?

11:47.489 --> 11:49.709
I don't know.
I haven't spoken to him.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.275
I want a lawyer.

11:56.106 --> 11:58.413
NYPD!

11:58.413 --> 11:59.457
We'll take second floor.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.772
That's creepy.

12:11.339 --> 12:13.428
Hey guys, got something
in the attic.

12:20.957 --> 12:23.438
It definitely
seems like our guy.

12:23.438 --> 12:24.744
Take everything.

12:29.357 --> 12:30.314
Huh.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.451
What the hell is this?

12:37.931 --> 12:40.063
They found a suicide note.

12:40.063 --> 12:42.500
Dated Christmas,
this past year, yeah.

12:42.500 --> 12:43.632
Kid was living in her attic.

12:43.632 --> 12:45.068
Does Linda know
where he is now?

12:45.068 --> 12:47.810
Well if she does, she loves
him enough to lie to us.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.072
And she lawyered up.

12:49.072 --> 12:50.987
Called a family friend
from some local firm.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.075
All right, well,
what are we doing?

12:52.075 --> 12:53.294
We just gonna
sit here and wait?

12:54.861 --> 12:56.601
Detective, you, uh,
feeling hangry?

12:56.601 --> 12:58.865
- I'll order some takeout.
- I'm getting out of here.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.431
Uh, not without an escort.

13:00.431 --> 13:02.607
- How about you come with us?
- Me?

13:02.607 --> 13:04.479
I'm just a humble
U.S. attorney, Captain.

13:04.479 --> 13:07.221
Yeah, but you hold
Uncle Sam's credit card.

13:07.221 --> 13:08.222
Funny.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.795
Mmm, wow.

13:15.795 --> 13:19.146
This mac and cheese is so good.

13:19.146 --> 13:20.887
Isn't that something?

13:20.887 --> 13:22.062
What?

13:22.062 --> 13:23.759
It's just good
to see Captain Benson

13:23.759 --> 13:25.282
embrace normalcy for a change.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.156
Towel!

14:19.249 --> 14:20.076
Gun!

14:23.863 --> 14:25.603
Where is he?
Can't see, can't see!

14:25.603 --> 14:27.475
I can.

14:34.177 --> 14:36.005
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

14:36.005 --> 14:37.354
- You get hit?
- I'm hit.

14:37.354 --> 14:38.878
Where?

14:38.878 --> 14:40.053
My left hip.

14:41.619 --> 14:43.447
Can you walk?

14:43.447 --> 14:46.581
- Not really.
- Come on. Up, up.

14:51.716 --> 14:53.718
To the left.

14:53.718 --> 14:54.981
To the right.

15:08.559 --> 15:09.952
Where is she?

15:09.952 --> 15:11.867
Stabler took Benson
to an urgent care nearby.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.303
Where's the shooter?

15:13.303 --> 15:16.611
He's taking a selfie,
and not the kind he hoped.

15:16.611 --> 15:17.829
Do we know who he is?

15:17.829 --> 15:19.744
Tracy Horner, 36.

15:19.744 --> 15:21.442
Trucker for a local
produce outfit.

15:21.442 --> 15:22.617
No record.

15:22.617 --> 15:24.401
Was it connected
to that website?

15:24.401 --> 15:26.012
Pulled security cams.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.752
He went straight
for Benson and Stabler.

15:27.752 --> 15:29.058
And we're
searching his place?

15:29.058 --> 15:30.755
Confiscating his computers.

15:30.755 --> 15:32.235
Everything by the book.
- Good.

15:32.235 --> 15:34.150
We need to prove a connection
between that website

15:34.150 --> 15:35.108
and the shooter.

15:38.328 --> 15:40.548
We really appreciate
your client being

15:40.548 --> 15:42.115
willing to talk to the NYPD.

15:42.115 --> 15:43.986
She's willing to listen.

15:43.986 --> 15:46.815
Yeah, that's nice.
Well, we need her to talk.

15:46.815 --> 15:48.208
What do you want me to say?

15:48.208 --> 15:50.079
I feel horrible. I really do.

15:50.079 --> 15:52.777
Your son put out a hit
on two of my closest friends.

15:52.777 --> 15:54.127
That's all you've gotta say?

15:54.127 --> 15:56.129
And he's directly linked
to murders and rapes

15:56.129 --> 15:57.260
<i>happening in New York.</i>

15:57.260 --> 15:59.088
<i>Hundreds of cases worldwide.</i>

15:59.088 --> 16:01.047
This is all completely
taking me off guard.

16:01.047 --> 16:02.526
I didn't know
anything about it.

16:02.526 --> 16:03.788
Kyle kept it all to himself.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.660
People are still dying.

16:05.660 --> 16:07.314
Women are still being raped.

16:07.314 --> 16:10.839
And it's gonna keep happening
unless we shut down this site.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.058
What do you want?

16:12.058 --> 16:13.973
We wanna know
where Kyle is now.

16:15.713 --> 16:17.889
I'm not giving up my son.

16:17.889 --> 16:19.195
This woman's exhausting.

16:19.195 --> 16:22.372
A mother who knows
she's failed her child.

16:22.372 --> 16:25.245
She's mitigating her own guilt
by protecting him now.

16:25.245 --> 16:26.768
So what do we do, Professor?

16:32.513 --> 16:34.994
- Who is she?
- This is Amanda Rollins.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.083
She's an adjunct professor
of Criminal Behavior.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.823
She's consulting on the case.

16:38.823 --> 16:40.956
I've been asked
to look at your son's

16:40.956 --> 16:43.306
suicide note, Mrs. Wilkie.

16:43.306 --> 16:46.092
Suicide note?

16:46.092 --> 16:50.748
Yeah, that's his handwriting,
isn't it?

17:01.107 --> 17:03.065
This is why he stayed home
on Christmas?

17:04.806 --> 17:05.850
To kill himself?

17:05.850 --> 17:08.592
Your son wanted to create

17:08.592 --> 17:12.596
the greatest amount of harm
for the smallest effort.

17:12.596 --> 17:15.730
He wanted to unleash
destruction into the world

17:15.730 --> 17:19.473
before he took himself
out of it.

17:19.473 --> 17:21.127
Why?

17:21.127 --> 17:23.999
Well, for some reason,
he felt that his death

17:23.999 --> 17:26.001
had more value than his life.

17:26.001 --> 17:28.308
But he changed his mind.

17:28.308 --> 17:29.787
Right.

17:29.787 --> 17:32.834
Well, the website--
his website--

17:32.834 --> 17:36.881
and all the chaos it created,

17:36.881 --> 17:38.840
that gave him something
to live for.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.015
It's not a pleasant thought,

17:40.015 --> 17:42.800
but that's really
the way it is.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.150
And poor Kyle.

17:44.150 --> 17:47.501
He--he was always just
a little off, you know?

17:47.501 --> 17:50.417
I took him to a child
psychologist, but--

17:55.509 --> 17:59.513
There's no cure
for sociopathy, Mrs. Wilkie.

17:59.513 --> 18:03.038
There's certainly no pills,
no vaccines.

18:03.038 --> 18:04.344
And the worst part of it is--

18:04.344 --> 18:06.476
- I tried. I tried.
- Yeah.

18:06.476 --> 18:09.392
And no amount of love
from his mother would help.

18:10.959 --> 18:12.613
Help us find him, Linda.

18:17.313 --> 18:19.054
Just got the results
from that second scan,

18:19.054 --> 18:20.838
and it looks like all the
pellets are finally out.

18:20.838 --> 18:22.492
Even the one by my hip?

18:22.492 --> 18:24.451
You're up to date
on your tetanus.

18:24.451 --> 18:26.279
I'll get you antibiotics,
you can get out of here.

18:26.279 --> 18:28.411
Oh, great. Thank you.
Thank you, Doctor.

18:28.411 --> 18:31.936
And no physical activity
for at least two weeks.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.377
How's your ass feeling?

18:37.377 --> 18:40.162
Well, I won't be
sitting any time soon.

18:40.162 --> 18:41.294
Get me out of here?

18:51.042 --> 18:52.218
You okay?

18:55.873 --> 18:57.527
Couldn't see anything.

18:57.527 --> 18:58.572
Heard that shot...

19:02.097 --> 19:03.968
Thought I'd lost you.

19:05.318 --> 19:09.278
I can't imagine what
that brings up for you.

19:13.064 --> 19:14.283
Yeah, Sarge.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.982
Send the pin.

19:17.982 --> 19:20.246
Kyle Wilkie's mom
just gave him up.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.073
- You need to go?
- Yeah.

19:22.073 --> 19:23.205
I'm glad.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.503
McCrary,
what are we walking into?

20:00.503 --> 20:03.463
Wilkie taught computers here
for the last five summers.

20:03.463 --> 20:04.986
So he knows the terrain.

20:04.986 --> 20:06.988
Cabins off that way,
cafeteria's on the other end.

20:06.988 --> 20:08.772
Ten or so miles
of hiking trails.

20:08.772 --> 20:10.992
Bright side is, the place
is closed for the season.

20:10.992 --> 20:13.386
Safe to assume
he knows we're coming.

20:13.386 --> 20:14.822
We know Wilkie's suicidal,

20:14.822 --> 20:17.346
so expect
self-destructive tendencies.

20:17.346 --> 20:19.174
Meaning what?

20:19.174 --> 20:22.308
Meaning he'd rather die than
have that website taken down.

20:22.308 --> 20:24.658
Whelan, Reyes--
you guys take the cafeteria.

20:24.658 --> 20:26.225
I'll take the hiking trails.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.444
Rollins and I'll hang back
while they clear the cabin,

20:28.444 --> 20:30.490
then we'll go in and search
for the kid's computer.

20:30.490 --> 20:33.144
All right. Let's go!

20:48.116 --> 20:50.379
I don't know about you,
but I can't wait

20:50.379 --> 20:52.294
to get the hell out of Ohio.

20:52.294 --> 20:53.469
You're telling me.

20:53.469 --> 20:55.471
Postponed my vacation for this.

20:55.471 --> 20:57.038
Where you going?

20:57.038 --> 20:59.954
I'm gonna take the train
across Canada.

20:59.954 --> 21:02.565
Dude, they got this
observation car--

21:02.565 --> 21:04.872
the further you get west,
you get lucky,

21:04.872 --> 21:06.830
you see the Northern Lights--

21:06.830 --> 21:08.745
while having a beer.

21:08.745 --> 21:10.965
Sounds like paradise
right about now.

21:10.965 --> 21:12.488
Mm-hmm.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.062
This is it.

21:23.630 --> 21:25.109
Must have surprised him.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.512
Fin.

21:36.512 --> 21:38.558
Look at this.

21:53.616 --> 21:56.097
<i>Bell, shot fired. Northeast.</i>

21:56.097 --> 21:58.186
Yeah, we just heard it
out here on the trail.

21:58.186 --> 21:59.492
We'll pursue.

21:59.492 --> 22:00.710
<i>Copy.</i>

22:00.710 --> 22:02.190
Reyes, Jamie.

22:02.190 --> 22:04.018
<i>We're gonna need you.</i>
- Yup, I heard the shot.

22:04.018 --> 22:06.281
<i>- Yeah, out by the lake.</i>
- Copy. Headed there now.

22:12.374 --> 22:13.375
See anything?

22:15.986 --> 22:18.946
No, but he sees us.

22:18.946 --> 22:21.252
He's got trail cams out here.

22:24.430 --> 22:25.561
Hey! He's up there.

22:25.561 --> 22:26.910
Let's go!

22:26.910 --> 22:28.129
All right, we're in pursuit.

22:28.129 --> 22:30.392
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- Headed to the lake.

22:30.392 --> 22:32.133
Copy, cutting
through the woods now.

22:32.133 --> 22:34.483
All right, keep us posted.
Be careful.

22:40.794 --> 22:42.012
Reyes, Whelan.

22:42.012 --> 22:44.363
I see him here.
He's not far from you.

22:54.198 --> 22:57.767
Officer down!
Officer down, I repeat!

22:57.767 --> 22:59.073
<i>Can you move him?</i>

22:59.073 --> 23:00.291
No.

23:00.291 --> 23:01.815
No, we need a medic now!

23:10.780 --> 23:12.260
Okay, he's wounded.

23:12.260 --> 23:14.218
He dropped the rifle, and
he's headed towards the lake.

23:15.524 --> 23:16.699
Kyle?

23:19.398 --> 23:20.834
Kyle!

23:27.841 --> 23:31.366
Go ahead, shoot.

23:31.366 --> 23:32.889
Put the sword down.

23:32.889 --> 23:34.369
Take me out.

23:34.369 --> 23:35.892
I don't care!

23:38.765 --> 23:40.941
Where's that goddamn medic?

23:42.899 --> 23:45.075
How's it--how's it look?

23:45.075 --> 23:46.642
You're gonna be okay.

23:46.642 --> 23:48.949
We're gonna get
you taken care of.

23:48.949 --> 23:50.733
Can't feel my legs.

23:50.733 --> 23:52.431
I can't feel my legs!

23:57.305 --> 23:59.481
Did my mother tell you
where to find me?

23:59.481 --> 24:00.700
That doesn't matter.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.049
We wanna help you.

24:02.049 --> 24:04.834
You've heard the term
Hyakunin Giri?

24:04.834 --> 24:08.708
It's a contest to see how many
men you can kill with a sword.

24:08.708 --> 24:10.318
Put down the sword.

24:15.802 --> 24:18.500
Shadowerk is my sword.

24:18.500 --> 24:19.893
It'll live on after I die.

24:19.893 --> 24:21.460
Sword down!

24:22.852 --> 24:24.201
I've already been
on this planet

24:24.201 --> 24:26.682
six months longer
than I expected.

24:40.740 --> 24:42.481
No!

24:47.660 --> 24:49.836
We need this guy alive.

24:49.836 --> 24:51.141
Where's the medic?

24:52.708 --> 24:54.362
I can't feel my legs, man.

24:54.362 --> 24:55.929
Hurry up!

24:55.929 --> 24:58.148
Come here!

24:58.148 --> 24:59.323
Hurry!

25:00.760 --> 25:02.501
Just breathe, just breathe.

25:02.501 --> 25:03.806
Hey!

25:03.806 --> 25:05.286
Hurry!
- Keep applying pressure.

25:05.286 --> 25:08.071
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Relax,
relax. Relax.

25:08.071 --> 25:09.986
I just need you to breathe.
We're not bad.

25:09.986 --> 25:12.511
I promise you, we're not bad.

25:12.511 --> 25:13.686
Calm down.

25:13.686 --> 25:15.818
Calm down, Jamie.

25:15.818 --> 25:17.037
- I'm coming in.
- Ready?

25:17.037 --> 25:18.517
Yeah. Okay.

25:18.517 --> 25:19.518
No, no, no, no!

25:23.696 --> 25:25.480
Medic's here with Jamie.

25:25.480 --> 25:28.788
They're working on him,
but he's gonna need an airlift.

25:28.788 --> 25:30.703
Stabler, what's going on?

25:30.703 --> 25:32.748
Kid just skewered himself!

25:32.748 --> 25:34.533
Oh, God, I'm freezing.
I'm freezing.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.883
Freezing. I'm freezing.

25:36.883 --> 25:39.015
Hey, man, you're--
you're gonna be okay.

25:39.015 --> 25:40.669
<i>We need immediate
medical assistance</i>

25:40.669 --> 25:43.498
<i>for Wilkie, now!</i>

25:43.498 --> 25:44.760
Hey.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.893
Don't worry about
any of that, okay?

25:46.893 --> 25:47.981
Just think about
the Northern Lights.

25:47.981 --> 25:49.896
Remember that?
- Go help the kid.

25:49.896 --> 25:51.506
Go help the kid.

25:51.506 --> 25:52.594
Go help the kid!

25:52.594 --> 25:53.813
Bro, what are you
talking about?

25:53.813 --> 25:55.031
We need Wilkie alive.
Go help the kid.

26:01.342 --> 26:04.127
Go save the kid.

26:04.127 --> 26:05.825
- Damn it!
- Go help the kid.

26:05.825 --> 26:07.000
Take over.

26:11.221 --> 26:13.572
We're gonna need
another medic now!

26:17.706 --> 26:18.794
Hey!

26:29.805 --> 26:32.416
Never thought I'd be rooting
for this guy to live.

26:35.028 --> 26:37.465
He can die after
the site is down.

26:48.041 --> 26:49.520
Where are you taking me?

26:49.520 --> 26:53.176
Prison hospital, New York.

26:53.176 --> 26:54.830
I've never been there before.

26:54.830 --> 26:57.180
Yeah? Well, you're ours now.

26:57.180 --> 27:00.227
And let me tell you, it looks
nothing like the brochure.

27:00.227 --> 27:03.665
The second we're done
with you, FBI and Interpol,

27:03.665 --> 27:05.275
they're gonna take turns.

27:05.275 --> 27:07.016
For what?

27:07.016 --> 27:11.978
The same thing we all want,
you to shut down that site.

27:11.978 --> 27:13.980
What if I say no?

27:15.546 --> 27:19.159
Hey. Hey, hey!

27:19.159 --> 27:20.943
We saved your life.

27:22.249 --> 27:24.207
You shouldn't have done that.

27:33.913 --> 27:37.090
Hey, Reyes, how's he doing?

27:43.096 --> 27:45.402
Yeah, no.

27:45.402 --> 27:46.795
I heard you, yeah.

27:50.146 --> 27:52.627
Tell him we got the kid.

27:52.627 --> 27:55.108
Tell him we couldn't have
done that without him.

27:58.285 --> 28:00.461
Whelan's out of surgery.

28:02.855 --> 28:06.075
The bullet went
through his spine.

28:13.082 --> 28:16.259
So you're saying we finally
got this guy in cuffs,

28:16.259 --> 28:18.609
and there have been three
more rapes in New York?

28:18.609 --> 28:20.002
After we arrested him,

28:20.002 --> 28:21.917
there was a serious spike
in traffic to the site.

28:21.917 --> 28:23.397
It's more popular than ever.

28:23.397 --> 28:25.834
My guess is, this guy's
going for an insanity plea.

28:25.834 --> 28:27.531
- You got him on suicide watch?
- Yes, 24/7.

28:27.531 --> 28:29.011
And where is he now?

28:29.011 --> 28:32.928
Just landed in the
prison ward at Brookside.

28:32.928 --> 28:35.583
I want him arraigned
in his hospital bed--

28:35.583 --> 28:37.193
today.

28:37.193 --> 28:38.760
It's pretty clear
Mr. Wilkie is suffering

28:38.760 --> 28:41.110
from significant
mental health issues.

28:41.110 --> 28:43.765
I'm not crazy.

28:43.765 --> 28:45.506
I'm not.

28:45.506 --> 28:47.508
Be that as it may, right now,
you're one of the most prolific

28:47.508 --> 28:49.292
mass murderers
in American history.

28:49.292 --> 28:50.859
Is that what you wanted?

28:50.859 --> 28:53.122
You don't have
to answer that.

28:53.122 --> 28:55.777
I wanted people
to know the truth.

28:55.777 --> 28:58.475
The truth? Okay, about what?

28:58.475 --> 29:00.129
Themselves.

29:00.129 --> 29:05.178
People try to show you who
they are with smiles and words.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.399
But faces lie.

29:09.399 --> 29:12.968
You can't really know someone
until they're anonymous.

29:12.968 --> 29:14.796
I'll tell you, being cops,
we understand that

29:14.796 --> 29:16.363
better than you might think.

29:16.363 --> 29:18.017
You're just agreeing with me
to get a confession.

29:18.017 --> 29:19.670
Oh, we don't
need a confession.

29:19.670 --> 29:21.150
We have evidence.

29:21.150 --> 29:22.978
From your computer,
the selfies.

29:22.978 --> 29:24.850
I am not shutting down
my website.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.808
People are still being hurt.

29:26.808 --> 29:28.549
By other people, not me.

29:28.549 --> 29:30.072
I need a moment
to talk to my client.

29:30.072 --> 29:31.247
Shut up!

29:37.950 --> 29:40.866
What are you willing to trade?

29:40.866 --> 29:43.520
How about
your mother's freedom?

29:43.520 --> 29:45.087
My mom had nothing
to do with this.

29:45.087 --> 29:47.089
Oh, the server
was in her office.

29:47.089 --> 29:48.699
That's not gonna go
over well with a jury.

29:48.699 --> 29:50.092
Oh, and she lied
to the police.

29:50.092 --> 29:51.790
She didn't even know
about Shadowerk.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.182
Well, you can talk
to the ADA about that,

29:53.182 --> 29:56.055
but they're extraditing her
from Ohio as we speak.

29:56.055 --> 29:57.839
And the Feds are going
for the death penalty.

29:57.839 --> 30:00.233
See, people were
raped and murdered,

30:00.233 --> 30:04.367
all while she protected you.

30:04.367 --> 30:05.847
You're lying.

30:05.847 --> 30:07.544
She's the one that gave me up.

30:07.544 --> 30:08.676
No, if it weren't
for your mother,

30:08.676 --> 30:10.025
we would have found you sooner.

30:10.025 --> 30:11.810
All she would tell us
is that her son

30:11.810 --> 30:14.290
would never be involved
in anything like this.

30:14.290 --> 30:16.771
Then we showed her
your suicide note.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.907
That devastated her.

30:23.299 --> 30:25.736
But still, she stood by you.

30:25.736 --> 30:28.957
See for her,
love isn't a lie.

30:28.957 --> 30:30.872
She feels it in her heart.

30:30.872 --> 30:32.526
You wouldn't know
what that's like.

30:32.526 --> 30:34.833
I love my mother.

30:36.573 --> 30:37.879
Do you?

30:41.100 --> 30:43.058
Prove it.

30:48.803 --> 30:50.196
<i>I miss you.</i>

30:50.196 --> 30:52.241
I miss you too, Jet.

30:52.241 --> 30:54.809
But I know
I'll never walk again.

30:54.809 --> 30:56.898
<i>Oh, so you're a doctor now?</i>

30:56.898 --> 30:58.987
<i>It might not be permanent.</i>

30:58.987 --> 31:00.989
Can't even move my hands.

31:02.643 --> 31:04.427
<i>It's too soon to tell.</i>

31:04.427 --> 31:05.907
Jet.

31:07.256 --> 31:11.652
Got this device that
sends shocks to my nerves,

31:11.652 --> 31:14.133
just so I can breathe.

31:15.786 --> 31:17.223
<i>- Jamie?</i>
- What?

31:19.181 --> 31:20.400
<i>I love you.</i>

31:27.233 --> 31:31.585
Hey, we'll call you soon, okay?

31:31.585 --> 31:33.892
<i>- Yeah. Bye.</i>
- Bye.

31:39.332 --> 31:42.726
Bro, you gotta let
people care about you.

31:42.726 --> 31:44.163
I can't live like this.

31:47.514 --> 31:49.342
I won't. I mean it.

31:49.342 --> 31:50.647
Oh man, you're just tired.

31:50.647 --> 31:51.910
You've been through a lot.

31:59.265 --> 32:02.659
I need you
to do something for me.

32:02.659 --> 32:03.922
Anything.

32:05.749 --> 32:08.709
You need to let me go.

32:10.276 --> 32:11.451
What?

32:12.931 --> 32:15.411
No one else is around.

32:20.329 --> 32:22.157
Come on, I'm serious.

32:27.249 --> 32:28.207
Hey.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.559
You heard Jet.

32:32.559 --> 32:34.778
You're gonna be fine.

32:34.778 --> 32:35.997
You hear me?
You're gonna be fine.

32:35.997 --> 32:37.346
You're gonna have
a long life ahead of you.

32:37.346 --> 32:38.347
It's not a life, Bobby.

32:38.347 --> 32:43.352
That's not my life.

32:43.352 --> 32:44.353
It's not.

32:46.747 --> 32:48.879
I'm serious.

32:50.577 --> 32:53.623
Disconnect the box.

32:53.623 --> 32:54.798
Please.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.367
I can't do that, bro.

32:58.367 --> 33:01.631
I can't. I'm sorry. I--

33:01.631 --> 33:03.894
Detective Whelan?

33:03.894 --> 33:05.853
Your father's here.

33:05.853 --> 33:07.202
Bring him in.

33:07.202 --> 33:08.551
Why don't I
take Dad downstairs

33:08.551 --> 33:11.206
for something to eat
and let you get some rest.

33:11.206 --> 33:12.903
No.

33:12.903 --> 33:14.427
I wanna see him.

33:16.777 --> 33:18.997
- You gonna be okay?
- Mm-hmm.

33:23.610 --> 33:25.351
See you in a bit.

34:18.230 --> 34:19.666
Against my better judgment,

34:19.666 --> 34:21.233
my client is willing
to cooperate.

34:21.233 --> 34:22.886
He'll plead guilty?

34:22.886 --> 34:24.627
So long as
you leave my mom alone.

34:24.627 --> 34:26.020
That's the offer
on the table,

34:26.020 --> 34:28.283
but he's gonna do life--
no negotiation.

34:28.283 --> 34:30.764
In case you haven't noticed,

34:30.764 --> 34:34.246
I don't care very much
about life anyway.

34:34.246 --> 34:35.769
And here's the final piece.

34:35.769 --> 34:40.121
You are gonna shut that
site down, or no deal.

36:23.137 --> 36:25.313
Hey.

37:58.667 --> 38:00.582
- Hey.
- Got you working already?

38:00.582 --> 38:01.975
Yeah.

38:01.975 --> 38:03.281
Well, unfortunately,
sexual assault

38:03.281 --> 38:05.370
doesn't stop because
some doctor in Ohio

38:05.370 --> 38:07.720
tells me to take two weeks off.

38:09.548 --> 38:10.723
Aw.

38:12.115 --> 38:14.335
I'm so sorry.

38:14.335 --> 38:17.164
About your guy, Whelan.

38:17.164 --> 38:18.557
Me too.

38:21.342 --> 38:23.475
Got me thinking again.

38:23.475 --> 38:25.215
About?

38:31.396 --> 38:33.702
How precious life is.

38:35.400 --> 38:36.488
What is this?

38:36.488 --> 38:38.098
A reminder.

38:38.098 --> 38:41.580
I wanted to give it to you
before I left.

38:41.580 --> 38:43.190
Before you left?

38:43.190 --> 38:44.539
You going somewhere?

38:44.539 --> 38:48.543
New case.
I'll be gone for a while.

38:48.543 --> 38:51.720
Well, thank you
for telling me this time.

38:58.248 --> 38:59.380
I like small boxes.

38:59.380 --> 39:00.816
I know.

39:00.816 --> 39:02.035
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

39:02.035 --> 39:03.253
Not so fast.

39:06.169 --> 39:10.260
I wanna know
what's in that box first.

39:10.260 --> 39:12.524
You do, do you?

39:12.524 --> 39:14.003
Okay.

39:15.875 --> 39:17.703
I'll make you a deal.

39:18.878 --> 39:20.836
You open it, you keep it.

39:33.936 --> 39:37.418
Even took
the price tag off.

39:37.418 --> 39:41.074
Having a little regret there,
aren't you?

39:41.074 --> 39:42.292
Nah.

39:46.601 --> 39:48.690
You can always fix things.

39:54.435 --> 39:57.133
I'll treasure it.

39:57.133 --> 39:58.134
Your turn.

40:11.104 --> 40:13.280
A compass.

40:13.280 --> 40:16.892
Elliot, this is--
this is beautiful.

40:19.199 --> 40:20.722
Thank you.

40:24.378 --> 40:26.641
Is this supposed to, uh,

40:26.641 --> 40:30.123
to lead me somewhere, or--

40:30.123 --> 40:31.820
to something?

40:34.954 --> 40:37.347
Lead you to happiness, Liv.

40:40.568 --> 40:42.135
Well, I, um...

40:44.093 --> 40:47.096
I sure as hell am gonna try.

40:50.796 --> 40:52.188
Me too--

40:56.584 --> 40:58.499
Partner.
