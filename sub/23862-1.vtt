01:44.272 --> 01:47.776
<i>We have come very far,
enduring many hardships.</i>

01:49.039 --> 01:53.294
<i>But at last, we found a
place where we can be safe.</i>

01:53.944 --> 01:55.113
<i>Together.</i>

01:55.563 --> 01:57.649
<i>At the other end of the ocean.</i>

02:13.610 --> 02:15.696
It's not how I remember it.

02:17.897 --> 02:19.295
<i>Mum had put all her hopes</i>

02:19.335 --> 02:21.678
<i>on the house where
she had grown up.</i>

02:22.236 --> 02:24.076
<i>It had been waiting for us,</i>

02:24.537 --> 02:27.541
<i>frozen in time for
over thirty years.</i>

02:40.744 --> 02:42.538
Is someone there?

02:46.055 --> 02:48.290
Just a coat stand
in the mirror, Sam.

02:48.895 --> 02:50.314
Don't be afraid.

03:01.330 --> 03:03.750
It's not a step to take lightly.

03:05.621 --> 03:07.457
We're no longer Fairbairns.

03:08.341 --> 03:12.045
From now on, our last name
will be "Marrowbone".

03:12.199 --> 03:13.598
Just like this house,

03:13.746 --> 03:15.644
which will be our new home.

03:20.081 --> 03:23.174
Once you cross that line,
there'll be no memories.

03:23.663 --> 03:26.977
Our story begins here.

03:27.531 --> 03:29.344
Will he ever find us, Mummy?

03:30.637 --> 03:31.806
Who?

03:34.066 --> 03:35.986
You see, I've crossed the line.

03:36.112 --> 03:37.865
I must've forgotten already.

03:38.544 --> 03:40.881
No one will bother us again.

03:41.574 --> 03:42.743
Ever.

04:12.814 --> 04:15.568
<i>We wanted to believe
that we would be safe.</i>

04:16.567 --> 04:19.238
<i>That we too had
a chance of happiness.</i>

04:20.418 --> 04:24.507
<i>That Mum's illness had disappeared
with the rest of our problems.</i>

04:24.721 --> 04:26.916
<i>The darkness we'd left
behind seem to vanish</i>

04:27.057 --> 04:29.154
<i>in the light of
those summer days.</i>

04:30.877 --> 04:32.379
<i>Nobody knew us.</i>

04:32.918 --> 04:35.463
<i>We could be free
for the first time.</i>

04:37.635 --> 04:40.306
<i>And we were about to
make a new friend</i>

04:40.409 --> 04:42.737
<i>that would change
our lives forever.</i>

04:42.955 --> 04:44.448
Oh, look at that, Sam!

04:44.557 --> 04:47.490
This must be the place they call
"The Red Witch Rock".

04:47.552 --> 04:48.834
It's a skull.

04:48.941 --> 04:51.278
Let's go back, Billy.
I don't like it.

04:52.123 --> 04:53.513
<i>Who goes there?</i>

04:53.654 --> 04:56.216
<i>How dare you invade
my dwellings.</i>

04:57.519 --> 04:59.120
I'm Sam Marrowbone.

04:59.199 --> 05:01.784
These are my two brothers,
Billy and Jack.

05:01.862 --> 05:03.909
And this is my sister Jane.

05:04.194 --> 05:06.781
<i>You have entered the
Red Witch lands.</i>

05:07.375 --> 05:09.378
<i>See that passage to your right?</i>

05:09.722 --> 05:11.475
<i>You must cross it.</i>

05:11.969 --> 05:14.514
<i>If you mean well,
you'd be free to go.</i>

05:14.881 --> 05:17.222
<i>But if you hide evil
within your heart,</i>

05:17.357 --> 05:20.534
<i>the walls would close in
and trap you forever.</i>

05:21.105 --> 05:22.524
<i>Do you dare cross it?</i>

05:22.605 --> 05:23.464
Jack, no.

05:23.529 --> 05:24.990
-Come on!
-Come on, Sammy!

05:25.398 --> 05:26.566
Be brave.

05:29.590 --> 05:31.738
The walls are closing in,
we shouldn't be here.

05:31.847 --> 05:33.841
Your soul must have been good.

05:34.728 --> 05:36.219
It's very slippy here.

05:38.482 --> 05:40.341
Hello, little one.

05:42.113 --> 05:43.532
Come closer.

05:46.349 --> 05:47.744
My name is Allie.

05:47.870 --> 05:50.231
Are you a prisoner
of the Red Witch?

05:50.496 --> 05:51.582
Yes.

05:52.122 --> 05:54.708
She punished me for
breaking into her garden.

05:54.778 --> 05:56.920
Leaving me trapped until someone

05:57.015 --> 06:00.043
dared cross the
passageway and rescue me.

06:00.419 --> 06:02.035
Now, is that someone you?

06:03.410 --> 06:07.182
Take these acorns in return.

06:07.451 --> 06:09.279
They aren't much now, but

06:09.467 --> 06:12.185
they'll grow big and strong
with our friendship.

06:13.334 --> 06:14.814
They're magic.

06:20.804 --> 06:22.429
So now that you're free,

06:23.749 --> 06:25.283
where would you like to go?

06:49.413 --> 06:52.140
<i>At the end of that
unforgettable day,</i>

06:52.202 --> 06:54.335
<i>Allie was already one of us.</i>

06:54.441 --> 06:56.444
Stop. Wait, okay, move forward.

06:56.773 --> 06:57.770
Why?

06:57.817 --> 06:59.450
It's too beautiful. Can I...?

06:59.906 --> 07:01.757
Get close together, come on.

07:02.406 --> 07:04.031
You guys ready?

07:04.296 --> 07:06.375
One, two...

07:06.811 --> 07:08.031
Great.

07:09.681 --> 07:10.920
Perfect.

07:12.334 --> 07:13.842
<i>We began again.</i>

07:14.521 --> 07:16.200
<i>We forgot the past.</i>

07:18.333 --> 07:20.419
<i>And we started a new life.</i>

07:21.802 --> 07:24.806
<i>For a while, we all
bought in to that illusion.</i>

07:26.841 --> 07:29.404
<i>But the journey to America had
taken what little strength</i>

07:29.435 --> 07:31.069
<i>Mum had left in her.</i>

07:31.248 --> 07:33.060
<i>Little did we know,</i>

07:33.170 --> 07:35.693
<i>that would be our
last summer together.</i>

07:44.299 --> 07:46.080
Bury me in the garden.

07:47.073 --> 07:48.993
I showed you where.

07:49.867 --> 07:53.581
You just have to turn 21.

07:53.903 --> 07:57.333
Stay hidden until then

07:58.833 --> 08:01.490
and no law will
take them from you.

08:03.372 --> 08:05.124
Swear to me.

08:06.592 --> 08:08.484
You'll stay together.

08:12.343 --> 08:14.144
Always stay together.

08:15.848 --> 08:17.267
I swear.

08:20.593 --> 08:23.312
Have a safe place ready.

08:24.843 --> 08:27.265
In case he finds you.

08:31.413 --> 08:33.163
In the cupboard.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.131
On the left.

09:00.034 --> 09:01.480
You lied.

09:02.770 --> 09:04.457
You lied in court.

09:05.597 --> 09:08.183
You kept his money
all this time.

09:14.749 --> 09:16.296
"My dearest Jack,

09:16.522 --> 09:19.794
"I'm so sorry I won't be there
for you as you grow up.

09:20.538 --> 09:22.666
"I no longer have the strength.

09:23.220 --> 09:27.288
"Jane will be Sam's mother,
as it was meant to be.

09:28.232 --> 09:31.154
"Tell Billy to not let his anger

09:31.350 --> 09:33.225
"take his beautiful heart.

09:34.786 --> 09:37.114
"And you, my Jack,
when the time comes,

09:37.208 --> 09:39.763
"do not forget to open
your heart to love.

09:41.426 --> 09:43.294
"You must keep them safe.

09:44.505 --> 09:45.798
"Always.

09:46.974 --> 09:51.263
Your loving mother,
Rose Marrowbone".

10:01.196 --> 10:02.698
Nothing,

10:03.495 --> 10:04.915
no one,

10:05.321 --> 10:06.323
ever...

10:06.801 --> 10:08.554
will separate us.

10:10.727 --> 10:12.229
We are one.

10:16.340 --> 10:17.816
Repeat after me.

10:19.796 --> 10:21.048
Nothing.

10:23.726 --> 10:25.062
Nothing.

10:25.763 --> 10:27.099
No one.

10:27.996 --> 10:30.019
-No one.
-No one.

10:30.515 --> 10:31.767
Ever.

10:33.213 --> 10:34.808
-Ever.
-Ever.

10:36.537 --> 10:37.715
Ever.

10:39.620 --> 10:41.034
We are one.

10:41.656 --> 10:43.417
-We are one.
-We are one.

10:47.159 --> 10:49.165
<i>We sealed our promise.</i>

10:49.556 --> 10:52.040
<i>And we started hiding
from the world...</i>

10:52.524 --> 10:54.720
<i>until I turned 21.</i>

11:35.472 --> 11:36.682
Jack!

11:40.159 --> 11:42.472
Jack! Jack!

11:53.890 --> 11:56.983
Six months later

12:28.283 --> 12:31.066
I'm tired of being
locked up in this house.

12:32.488 --> 12:34.551
It won't be long before
your birthday, Jack.

12:34.653 --> 12:37.082
We should start thinking
about your party.

12:40.475 --> 12:43.210
That lawyer Porter was hanging
on the fence last week again.

12:43.374 --> 12:45.226
We'll be done with him soon enough.

12:45.251 --> 12:47.647
Come Christmas time it
will all be different.

12:47.820 --> 12:49.007
You'll see, Billy.

12:49.075 --> 12:50.411
Billy! Billy!

12:51.411 --> 12:52.138
What Sam?

12:52.216 --> 12:53.584
I heard a noise
behind the mirror

12:53.615 --> 12:55.092
and the cover is falling off.

12:55.172 --> 12:56.321
If you don't do something,

12:56.398 --> 12:58.054
ghost might be able
to see us again.

12:58.198 --> 12:59.423
Stop being such a baby.

12:59.544 --> 13:01.481
You don't need to be scared.

13:02.212 --> 13:04.622
Sam, the ghost has
been gone for months.

13:06.234 --> 13:08.276
Here, give me this.

13:09.984 --> 13:11.328
Scoundrel?

13:15.169 --> 13:17.631
Come on, Scoundrel,
come get your breakfast.

13:18.094 --> 13:20.598
So that's what's making
the noises behind the walls.

13:20.701 --> 13:22.155
It's that big rat.

13:22.828 --> 13:25.008
Sam, stop feeding it.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.250
It's making holes
all over the house.

13:27.422 --> 13:28.867
Do you want me to
let her starve?

13:28.930 --> 13:30.195
You don't know where
that thing has been.

13:30.219 --> 13:31.586
All right? You could get rabies.

13:31.641 --> 13:33.664
She won't bite me,
she's my friend.

13:33.954 --> 13:35.562
Terrible thing, rabies.

13:35.703 --> 13:37.015
You'll get foam
coming out your mouth

13:37.039 --> 13:38.516
until your insides
are all rotten.

13:38.578 --> 13:40.093
I'll have to spend my
last bullet on you.

13:40.168 --> 13:42.559
Then I'll hide behind the mirror
and scream and cry all night

13:42.606 --> 13:44.205
and you'll never sleep again.

13:44.236 --> 13:46.329
Yeah, but the dead
don't cry or scream.

13:46.518 --> 13:49.940
Tell me that next time you hear the
ghost in the middle of the night.

14:46.859 --> 14:48.007
Oh, fuck.

14:48.875 --> 14:49.875
Ah!

14:57.510 --> 14:58.637
Jack!

15:02.794 --> 15:05.089
No extra money, no nonsense.

15:05.552 --> 15:06.804
We'll see.

15:09.393 --> 15:10.313
Hello.

15:10.377 --> 15:13.713
We'll follow you on the map, Jack,
 so you don't feel alone.

15:24.163 --> 15:26.348
He's just left the
Marrowbone home.

15:26.435 --> 15:28.481
He's going through the forest.

15:32.046 --> 15:33.575
<i>That was a bird.</i>

15:33.888 --> 15:37.756
And then he goes
down the tunnel.

15:37.833 --> 15:39.612
<i>Through the tunnel.</i>

15:41.690 --> 15:45.393
And then, he goes
out of the tunnel...

15:45.851 --> 15:48.929
<i>and goes on the bridge...</i>

15:51.213 --> 15:52.757
and then...

15:54.166 --> 15:56.880
<i>Oh, he should see
Allie's farm by now.</i>

15:56.978 --> 15:59.186
-Say, "Hi, Allie"!
-Hi, Allie.

15:59.264 --> 16:03.161
-Hi, we miss you!
-We miss you.

16:06.472 --> 16:09.559
<i>And he goes through
the bumpy mud.</i>

16:09.805 --> 16:12.310
<i>And he goes through the path.</i>

16:12.866 --> 16:14.952
He goes all the way up.

16:17.173 --> 16:20.712
-And now he's getting near town.
-Oh.

16:24.099 --> 16:26.407
<i>He's almost there.</i>

16:29.236 --> 16:31.962
And then he goes into that shop.

16:32.579 --> 16:34.944
<i>Careful, Jack.</i>

16:35.699 --> 16:37.535
<i>Be brave, Jack.</i>

16:39.239 --> 16:40.658
Catch me if you can!

16:40.824 --> 16:42.697
<i>Two weeks ago today...</i>

16:45.952 --> 16:47.335
Oh, Jack.

16:47.420 --> 16:49.944
I was beginning to think you
wouldn't show up this week.

16:50.309 --> 16:52.108
Hm, they smell delicious.

16:53.554 --> 16:54.973
You bring a list?

16:58.587 --> 17:00.556
<i>Thousands saluted
the American flag</i>

17:00.594 --> 17:02.371
<i>stiff with wires
so that it would wave.</i>

17:02.476 --> 17:04.630
<i>Then inspected the conditions
of the lunar module...</i>

17:04.872 --> 17:07.643
How's your mother feeling?
Any better?

17:08.643 --> 17:10.281
Not really.

17:10.546 --> 17:12.242
It's this change in weather.

17:12.311 --> 17:13.800
I'm sorry to hear that.

17:13.920 --> 17:15.756
I'm sure she'll get
well soon, though.

17:15.898 --> 17:17.526
Give her my love, will you?

18:21.416 --> 18:23.353
What's with all of these books?

18:24.064 --> 18:25.681
They came in on Friday.

18:26.025 --> 18:30.113
From a library weeding in a place
I used to work in Portland.

18:30.544 --> 18:34.458
I say we let their weeds
become our flowers.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.303
I've missed you.

18:58.466 --> 19:00.661
I'm sorry I didn't
make it last week.

19:01.512 --> 19:02.848
It's okay.

19:03.583 --> 19:05.836
Oh, I have the book
that you asked for.

19:11.304 --> 19:12.306
Thank you.

19:12.850 --> 19:14.061
You're welcome.

19:14.175 --> 19:17.073
Uh, how's Sam coming along?
Does he need another one?

19:19.542 --> 19:21.697
How can he read so fast?

19:21.815 --> 19:24.542
It's almost at least
300 pages long.

19:26.226 --> 19:28.062
I miss the little guy.

19:28.804 --> 19:30.807
And Jane, and Billy.

19:31.536 --> 19:34.126
It's so easy for me to just
pop by, I could...

19:34.200 --> 19:35.817
Perhaps my mother's better.

19:39.643 --> 19:40.909
Hello there.

19:41.559 --> 19:43.145
Mr. Porter.

19:46.850 --> 19:48.019
So?

19:49.097 --> 19:50.464
What do you think?

19:50.534 --> 19:52.159
Very smart.

19:52.300 --> 19:54.953
Do you remember that position
I told you about in New York?

19:55.276 --> 19:56.867
Parker & Jameson.

19:59.883 --> 20:02.219
Does this mean...?

20:02.360 --> 20:05.444
Well, it means that they fell under
my charm and I got the job.

20:05.639 --> 20:09.328
It is wonderful, Tom.
I'm just so happy for you.

20:09.459 --> 20:14.541
Anyway, I happen to stroll
past the strand and...

20:14.727 --> 20:18.477
I couldn't help thinking of...

20:19.171 --> 20:20.313
you.

20:20.555 --> 20:21.899
What is that?

20:22.071 --> 20:25.071
It's a donation,
if you will, for the library.

20:32.974 --> 20:35.563
This is a first edition,
I can't possibly accept this.

20:35.638 --> 20:37.458
I just wish you could've
seen the place.

20:37.552 --> 20:40.693
You would love it. Maybe
I should take you sometime.

20:40.817 --> 20:42.528
You ever been to New York City?

21:05.960 --> 21:07.504
Jack Fairbairn.

21:08.597 --> 21:10.433
It's Marrowbone now.

21:11.345 --> 21:13.416
We go by my mother's last name.

21:14.140 --> 21:15.726
Right, well, uh...

21:16.170 --> 21:18.585
speaking of which, the other
heirs have already signed off.

21:18.749 --> 21:21.436
And I need to collect the
transfer charges on the estate.

21:22.315 --> 21:23.948
I'll come around the
house tomorrow.

21:23.994 --> 21:26.526
Tell your mother have a bank
check ready for 200 dollars.

21:27.990 --> 21:29.526
She's quite unwell.

21:30.380 --> 21:32.489
Perhaps it would be best
if I took the papers and

21:32.614 --> 21:35.083
I have my mother sign them
and bring them back to you.

21:35.413 --> 21:37.291
I need to certify the signatures.

21:39.036 --> 21:41.349
I'll be there tomorrow. Noon.

21:54.087 --> 21:55.254
Bye, Jack.

21:55.783 --> 21:57.050
I'll see you soon.

22:10.992 --> 22:12.461
Fucking lawyers.

22:12.718 --> 22:15.898
Oh, God, I knew that creepy
bastard would bring us trouble.

22:16.266 --> 22:18.031
How much money do we have
in Mother's savings?

22:18.071 --> 22:18.891
Shit.

22:18.922 --> 22:20.555
Not even 50 dollars.

22:20.672 --> 22:23.554
Even if I sold a thousand cakes,
we wouldn't have the money.

22:23.617 --> 22:25.226
What are we going to do, Jack?

22:25.297 --> 22:28.125
I don't know, but if the truth
comes out, they will separate us.

22:28.840 --> 22:29.842
Jack.

22:31.177 --> 22:32.263
Jack.

22:33.577 --> 22:34.788
The box.

22:34.984 --> 22:36.933
What does it matter?
We don't have it anymore.

22:36.976 --> 22:38.924
-I could get it back.
-No!

22:39.130 --> 22:40.632
What else are we gonna do?

22:40.711 --> 22:44.148
Jack, you promised me we would
never touch that money again.

22:45.007 --> 22:46.368
Please?

22:48.996 --> 22:51.132
I promised you a lot of things.

22:53.026 --> 22:54.991
I can get it back, Jack.

24:23.166 --> 24:24.682
We're rich!

24:26.714 --> 24:28.065
Yes, Sam!

24:28.269 --> 24:29.667
Yes, we're rich!

24:29.858 --> 24:31.307
Oh, come on!

24:32.581 --> 24:35.159
Oh, Jane, come on,
what's the matter?

24:35.681 --> 24:38.810
It's blood money. We all
know where it comes from.

24:39.299 --> 24:41.120
We shouldn't even touch it.

24:41.864 --> 24:43.366
'Tis cursed.

24:44.525 --> 24:45.861
Jack.

24:46.448 --> 24:47.776
We don't have a choice.

24:48.143 --> 24:51.489
Porter is coming tomorrow.
We have to be ready.

25:10.313 --> 25:12.024
This isn't going to work.

25:13.004 --> 25:14.256
It will.

25:18.672 --> 25:20.554
It needs to look just like Mum's.

25:21.141 --> 25:23.064
-Please!
-No.

25:25.343 --> 25:28.586
It's Mum's room. I should
be allowed in there, too.

25:28.902 --> 25:30.930
There are mirrors in here,
you can't go in.

25:31.727 --> 25:32.829
Please.

26:12.562 --> 26:14.999
What are we going to do
about the fortress?

26:15.827 --> 26:17.608
We won't come inside.

26:36.140 --> 26:37.070
What are you doing?

26:37.147 --> 26:38.905
Painkillers Mum never took.

26:40.601 --> 26:42.104
Billy, that could hill him.

26:42.389 --> 26:44.014
Just in case of emergency.

26:47.991 --> 26:49.140
He's here.

26:53.876 --> 26:55.626
Everyone is clear on the plan?

27:01.178 --> 27:04.233
I forgot to open the gate.
So sorry.

27:16.076 --> 27:16.982
Mm.

27:19.724 --> 27:20.887
What's this?

27:21.327 --> 27:22.748
Mother's savings.

27:23.138 --> 27:25.623
We haven't had time to make
arrangements to change it.

27:26.407 --> 27:27.851
These are pounds.

27:28.194 --> 27:30.390
Yeah, 200 pounds.

27:31.146 --> 27:32.004
So?

27:32.098 --> 27:33.840
Pounds are worth twice
as much as dollars.

27:34.051 --> 27:36.121
That should cover all the costs

27:36.285 --> 27:38.868
and...any fees.

27:43.580 --> 27:45.352
I said a bank check.

27:49.212 --> 27:50.976
Let me get you something to drink.

28:03.602 --> 28:05.492
I'd like to beg one last favor.

28:05.625 --> 28:07.672
If it's not too much to ask.

28:09.245 --> 28:12.374
Our mother, she can't
get out of bed.

28:12.991 --> 28:15.912
And she feels humiliated, the
idea of you seeing her this way.

28:16.071 --> 28:17.618
Would you mind if I bring
the papers upstairs

28:17.759 --> 28:19.454
and bring them down
signed for you?

28:25.951 --> 28:27.443
Have her sign both copies.

28:27.576 --> 28:30.216
Would you forget the damn
lemonade? I don't have all day.

28:42.276 --> 28:43.847
You just need to
sign both copies.

28:43.987 --> 28:44.956
Both?

28:45.041 --> 28:48.048
Jack, can't possibly get the
signature right two times!

29:39.042 --> 29:40.894
He'll notice they're
not the same.

29:56.983 --> 29:58.288
You have to do it.

30:43.481 --> 30:44.951
-Jane, please, now.
-One second!

30:45.014 --> 30:46.061
There's no time.

30:46.147 --> 30:48.436
Sign the second one. Sign.

30:55.059 --> 30:56.419
Jane, he's outside.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.997
-Jane, he's outside.
-Shut up, Jack.

30:59.183 --> 31:00.519
Jane, there's no time.

31:00.594 --> 31:01.274
Please.

31:01.329 --> 31:02.907
Mum, stay in bed.

31:03.366 --> 31:06.274
No, Mum, the doctor
said you can't get up.

31:07.025 --> 31:08.027
Sign.

31:08.522 --> 31:09.904
Almost done.

31:11.582 --> 31:13.085
You can't come out.

31:17.552 --> 31:18.599
He's coming, Jane.

31:18.735 --> 31:19.615
Mum.

31:19.746 --> 31:21.607
Mum, stay in bed.

31:25.979 --> 31:27.107
Now!

31:31.371 --> 31:32.640
Mum, I'll go to see Porter.

31:32.788 --> 31:34.240
I'll be back in a minute.

31:38.402 --> 31:39.941
I'm sorry, I was just...

31:41.704 --> 31:42.941
Is she all right?

31:49.349 --> 31:51.114
She just has no strength.

31:51.379 --> 31:53.417
I had no idea
it had gotten so bad.

31:55.187 --> 31:58.302
So, this solves it.

31:58.450 --> 32:01.075
Marrowbone house now officially
belongs to your mother.

32:05.536 --> 32:07.956
I'm glad we could...

32:09.089 --> 32:12.517
wrap this thing up before
someone discovered...

32:14.042 --> 32:15.615
You know, um...

32:18.007 --> 32:20.192
that business about your father.

32:22.750 --> 32:24.503
We're most grateful.

32:26.981 --> 32:29.114
Especially for your discretion.

32:33.676 --> 32:36.514
Well, I better get out of here
before the rain catches me.

32:37.936 --> 32:40.309
Good luck, Mr. Marrowbone.

32:44.246 --> 32:46.645
And then he says, "I didn't come
here for a picnic, Mr. Marrowbone,

32:46.793 --> 32:48.973
I came here for a bank check".

32:50.112 --> 32:52.112
So, I wasted to give him
the other lemonade.

32:52.256 --> 32:53.716
Stop delaying the inevitable.

32:53.892 --> 32:56.708
It's time to meet your
demise, my dear brother.

33:01.569 --> 33:03.656
Today, Alaska march...

33:03.764 --> 33:05.998
of the Northern
Western territories

33:06.069 --> 33:07.546
can't be defeated.

33:07.803 --> 33:09.245
Remember, brave little soldier,

33:09.410 --> 33:12.519
the northwestern territories
have never been conquered.

33:12.675 --> 33:14.120
Oh, until today.

33:18.263 --> 33:19.183
Six!

33:19.362 --> 33:19.902
Yes!

33:20.011 --> 33:20.628
No!

33:20.730 --> 33:21.980
Oh-oh!

33:22.412 --> 33:24.207
-You are done.
-Jack!

33:30.348 --> 33:31.699
What is it, Sam?

33:34.120 --> 33:35.230
Six!

33:37.762 --> 33:39.583
Go find the dice.

33:43.821 --> 33:45.735
That doesn't count,
the die went off the table.

33:45.813 --> 33:46.954
The hell it don't!

33:47.012 --> 33:48.149
-Sorry!
-Shut up, Sam.

33:48.227 --> 33:50.344
You killed my
Mongolians that way!

33:50.391 --> 33:51.469
That-That's true.

33:51.594 --> 33:52.641
Fine.

33:52.742 --> 33:54.555
-Fine.
-Sorry, Billy!

33:54.649 --> 33:55.891
No, no, fine, fine.

33:56.047 --> 33:58.141
Since the floor counts as board.

33:59.238 --> 34:00.199
Ah, Billy!

34:00.246 --> 34:01.793
You're such a sore loser!

34:01.894 --> 34:03.730
You said the floor
counts as board.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.902
Sam, w-what's the score?
What's he got?

34:06.438 --> 34:07.722
Check it, Sam.

34:25.946 --> 34:26.947
One.

34:27.081 --> 34:28.500
Oh, tough go!

34:28.532 --> 34:30.594
-Ooh, sorry, Billy.
-Tough go.

34:30.697 --> 34:32.049
What's the other one?

34:33.580 --> 34:35.235
I think you're nervous, Billy.

34:35.306 --> 34:36.829
You're a nervous one.

34:36.998 --> 34:38.052
One.

35:19.751 --> 35:20.893
Six!

35:34.472 --> 35:35.557
Six!

35:36.224 --> 35:38.541
He better not be
attacking Brazil next.

35:47.895 --> 35:49.032
Jack?

36:02.621 --> 36:04.770
Jack, the ghost is back!

36:05.388 --> 36:06.557
To the fortress.

36:21.785 --> 36:23.918
Cover the man
before he gets out.

36:26.208 --> 36:29.708
♪ Wouldn't it be nice
if we were older? ♪

36:29.771 --> 36:31.012
Stay here.
♪ Then we wouldn't ♪

36:31.074 --> 36:33.547
♪ have to wait so long ♪

36:33.625 --> 36:36.211
♪ And wouldn't it be
nice to live together ♪

36:53.253 --> 36:56.597
♪ Wouldn't it be nice
if we could wake up ♪

37:05.492 --> 37:06.985
He'll never leave us.

37:08.809 --> 37:10.423
Not even death.

38:18.562 --> 38:19.846
You blacked out.

38:20.791 --> 38:22.958
I had to come out
to bring you back again.

38:23.239 --> 38:25.859
I hate living with a ghost.

38:30.324 --> 38:31.838
It's that money.

38:33.439 --> 38:35.916
His ghost is back
because we used it.

38:38.222 --> 38:40.845
As soon as the sun rises,
you'll give it back.

38:42.869 --> 38:44.932
Let him take it to hell.

39:58.354 --> 39:59.370
Hey!

40:01.948 --> 40:03.082
Oh, hello.

40:03.792 --> 40:05.212
Hey, can I give you a lift home?

40:05.763 --> 40:07.060
Thank you, Mr. Porter,

40:07.099 --> 40:09.138
but honestly,
the bus is no bother.

40:09.583 --> 40:12.758
Mr. Porter? What
happened to Tom?

40:17.186 --> 40:18.486
I insist.

40:23.751 --> 40:25.265
I meant to ask you
something, Allie.

40:25.673 --> 40:28.107
Hey, so these Marrowbone kids...

40:29.270 --> 40:30.955
How well do you know them?

40:32.183 --> 40:34.936
We're good friends, I guess.

40:36.222 --> 40:37.027
Huh.

40:39.012 --> 40:40.528
It's just that they worry me.

40:40.802 --> 40:42.832
You know, the fact that
they live so isolated.

40:43.388 --> 40:45.122
Always hiding away
from the community.

40:45.263 --> 40:47.413
They're not hiding.

40:47.553 --> 40:48.966
Allie, come on.

40:49.498 --> 40:51.716
The poor kid, Sam doesn't
even go to school.

40:51.977 --> 40:54.231
They live too far away.

40:54.654 --> 40:56.657
And Sam is home schooled.

40:56.925 --> 40:59.427
Jane helps with his homework
and I check his notebooks.

41:00.466 --> 41:01.232
Huh.

41:01.962 --> 41:03.746
Well, I guess that's something.

41:04.708 --> 41:06.685
It's just so unfortunate that

41:06.795 --> 41:09.279
he's forced to live that way
because of his father.

41:16.353 --> 41:20.201
I mean, I guess Jack has
told you all about him.

41:22.267 --> 41:24.187
I know he was a cruel man.

41:24.853 --> 41:26.564
Cruel man?

41:28.691 --> 41:30.777
That's putting it mildly.

41:34.765 --> 41:36.382
I've tried to help them.

41:36.850 --> 41:39.092
And at least, I've been able
to secure them the house

41:39.194 --> 41:41.984
before I leave, but still...

41:43.513 --> 41:44.811
If the truth ever got out,

41:44.968 --> 41:47.913
I don't know what kind of
future there would be for them.

41:50.503 --> 41:53.800
And you know how people
are around here.

42:12.941 --> 42:14.152
Sam?

42:15.491 --> 42:16.493
Sam!

42:18.748 --> 42:20.376
Sam, where are you?

42:25.949 --> 42:27.493
Still scared?

42:27.557 --> 42:30.019
You'll have to come out
of the fortress eventually.

42:33.305 --> 42:35.086
I miss Mummy.

42:37.098 --> 42:38.434
I miss her too.

42:38.845 --> 42:40.547
Where is she now?

42:41.759 --> 42:43.633
She's in a good place.

42:45.789 --> 42:47.555
Well, I want to go with her.

42:49.401 --> 42:53.070
I don't like hiding here and
being alone all the time.

42:56.189 --> 42:57.718
We're not alone.

42:59.150 --> 43:00.652
We have Allie.

43:01.850 --> 43:03.719
I'll show you something.

43:05.452 --> 43:08.122
You see? Follow my point.

43:09.335 --> 43:10.900
See Allie's farm?

43:11.548 --> 43:12.550
Yeah.

43:23.362 --> 43:24.948
What we looking for?

43:25.184 --> 43:26.478
Just wait.

43:33.236 --> 43:34.838
Is that really her?

43:37.141 --> 43:38.626
What's she saying?

43:40.105 --> 43:41.658
She says hello.

43:42.025 --> 43:44.627
-Do you want to talk to her?
-What do I say?

43:46.018 --> 43:47.775
How about your name?

43:48.159 --> 43:50.541
So she knows it's
you talking today.

43:50.664 --> 43:51.917
Dot, dot.

43:53.945 --> 43:55.422
Dot, dash.

44:11.275 --> 44:12.527
Hi, Sam.

44:18.947 --> 44:21.408
She's asking how are you.

44:22.200 --> 44:25.079
I'm very happy.
How do I say that?

44:25.990 --> 44:27.576
Dot, dot.

44:29.054 --> 44:30.516
Dot, dash...

44:40.012 --> 44:41.993
I need to get out of this house.

44:42.395 --> 44:43.814
We all do.

44:50.455 --> 44:51.663
Jack.

44:53.060 --> 44:55.887
You never really told me
much about your father.

45:04.207 --> 45:05.960
He was a monster.

45:07.911 --> 45:11.478
The things he did,
they're unspeakable.

45:20.908 --> 45:23.161
He was the reason we ran here.

45:23.393 --> 45:25.240
We had to get away from him.

45:26.343 --> 45:27.967
Is he still in England?

45:30.264 --> 45:31.849
He's dead now.

45:33.507 --> 45:35.245
He can't hurt us anymore.

46:42.446 --> 46:43.531
Jane?

46:48.302 --> 46:49.387
Sam?

46:53.083 --> 46:54.252
I'm home!

47:05.422 --> 47:06.640
Where have you been?

47:09.952 --> 47:10.953
Out.

47:11.854 --> 47:12.939
Out?

47:13.500 --> 47:14.734
Oh, but nobody leaves the house

47:14.906 --> 47:17.290
unless it's absolutely
necessary, Jack.

47:17.998 --> 47:20.335
Your rule, not mine.

47:20.668 --> 47:22.476
I can smell her
perfume, you know.

47:22.633 --> 47:24.070
Every single time.

47:24.210 --> 47:25.421
That's strange.

47:25.517 --> 47:26.704
You know what I mean.

47:26.823 --> 47:29.400
Can't expect him
to be here all the time.

47:29.891 --> 47:31.078
They love each other.

47:32.485 --> 47:34.654
She doesn't know the first
thing about him, Jane.

47:34.773 --> 47:36.401
Does she ever ask about us?

47:36.474 --> 47:38.406
Of course she does,
all the time.

47:38.639 --> 47:40.391
Yeah? What do you tell her?

47:42.165 --> 47:43.751
Yeah, I thought so.

47:44.220 --> 47:46.807
You talk too much.
You'll get us in trouble.

47:46.894 --> 47:48.565
Uh-oh, someone's jealous.

47:48.890 --> 47:51.382
Shut up, Sam.
Why would I be jealous?

47:51.484 --> 47:53.562
'Cause Jack has a
girlfriend and you don't.

47:53.687 --> 47:55.148
I don't care.

47:55.606 --> 47:56.887
Have you kissed her yet?

47:57.075 --> 47:58.598
It's none of your business.

47:58.723 --> 48:00.668
What if she comes to
live with us someday?

48:00.801 --> 48:03.060
Home would be a better
place with her in it.

48:03.192 --> 48:04.677
You can't be serious, Jane.

48:04.795 --> 48:07.407
Why can't I live with
the girl that I love?

48:07.950 --> 48:09.505
What about our promise?

48:09.880 --> 48:11.745
Does that mean nothing
to you anymore?

48:11.910 --> 48:14.201
The things that I do
to keep you all safe.

48:14.545 --> 48:15.707
Safe?

48:15.873 --> 48:17.880
Oh, tell me, what about
this feels safe?

48:17.951 --> 48:20.576
We're trapped in here while you go
around doing whatever you please.

48:20.623 --> 48:22.209
But that's just fine, Jack.

48:22.247 --> 48:23.312
-Be quiet.
-Fine.

48:23.406 --> 48:24.547
-Maybe she should come
-Be quiet.

48:24.593 --> 48:25.599
and live her then, huh?

48:25.661 --> 48:26.867
Why? Why be quiet?

48:26.937 --> 48:28.250
-Shut up.
-Tell her about Mum.

48:28.343 --> 48:29.601
-Billy!
-Tell her the truth about Dad.

48:29.672 --> 48:30.843
-Why can't you handle it?
-Get out!

48:30.899 --> 48:31.649
'Cause you know
it's the truth.

48:31.726 --> 48:33.031
-Why don't you tell her the truth?
-Get out!

48:33.062 --> 48:35.125
-Billy!
-Jane, don't touch me!

48:35.225 --> 48:36.519
Don't shut the door on me!

48:36.685 --> 48:37.854
-Get out!
-Why?

48:37.965 --> 48:40.200
-Get out! Get out!
-Why, because you want me to leave?

48:40.278 --> 48:41.551
-You want me to leave?
-Leave me--

48:41.576 --> 48:43.106
You need me more
than I need you!

48:43.168 --> 48:44.028
Leave!

49:29.192 --> 49:31.111
Are you feeling better?

49:32.096 --> 49:33.666
Shhh.

49:36.538 --> 49:38.353
My head has exploded.

49:42.625 --> 49:44.628
Take it easy on him.

49:45.536 --> 49:47.831
He's like a caged bird, Jack.

49:49.512 --> 49:51.294
You have Sam.

49:52.293 --> 49:53.958
You have Allie.

49:58.430 --> 50:00.083
He has no one.

51:40.947 --> 51:42.222
Mummy.

Jack!

The mirror!

54:54.507 --> 54:55.640
What?

54:56.724 --> 54:58.937
Sam has been to Mother's room.

55:07.291 --> 55:09.410
He said he saw
something in there.

55:09.907 --> 55:11.801
In the wardrobe mirror.

55:13.021 --> 55:15.028
He thinks he saw
the ghost, Jack.

55:17.102 --> 55:18.668
Well, that was just
a lie we told Sam

55:18.693 --> 55:20.364
so he wouldn't know the truth.

55:22.040 --> 55:23.719
And the truth is
we walled up a man

55:23.814 --> 55:26.495
and let him die and
rot over our heads.

55:29.006 --> 55:30.438
Our own father.

55:31.867 --> 55:33.953
He was a murderer, Jane.

55:34.658 --> 55:36.203
He came here to kill us.

55:36.408 --> 55:37.910
And what are we then?

55:39.935 --> 55:42.314
I can still remember
those screams.

55:42.755 --> 55:44.513
Those first weeks.

55:46.585 --> 55:48.713
It seemed like
he would never die.

55:49.200 --> 55:52.212
Is it so crazy to think
his ghost is still up there?

55:52.675 --> 55:56.096
He can't hurt us now.
He's dead and gone.

55:56.425 --> 55:58.147
He's not gone.

55:59.928 --> 56:02.264
We need to give him
a proper burial.

56:04.272 --> 56:06.705
We are never going
back to that place.

56:07.328 --> 56:08.747
Understood?

56:09.833 --> 56:10.835
Never.

56:12.089 --> 56:14.015
We can't live in a tomb.

56:37.684 --> 56:39.103
Oh, Allie!

56:39.716 --> 56:40.787
Hello.

56:41.386 --> 56:43.431
-Packing already?
-Yes.

56:43.545 --> 56:46.441
Uh, actually, can I see you
for a moment?

56:46.761 --> 56:48.597
-Of course.
-Great.

56:50.415 --> 56:51.501
Thank you.

56:54.053 --> 56:56.830
Gosh, I'm sorry about the mess.

56:57.003 --> 56:58.755
That's quite all right.

57:05.263 --> 57:06.432
So?

57:10.411 --> 57:12.747
There's something I...

57:18.334 --> 57:19.335
Here.

57:20.527 --> 57:21.863
What is this?

57:22.370 --> 57:23.456
Open it.

57:23.762 --> 57:25.140
Tom, I...

57:34.647 --> 57:36.150
Would you be my guest?

57:36.411 --> 57:38.596
There's so many places
I would love to show you.

57:38.795 --> 57:39.939
Tom, I...

57:41.018 --> 57:43.213
I really wish you wouldn't.

57:44.324 --> 57:46.245
I'm rushing too much, aren’t I?

57:46.370 --> 57:48.246
No, it's...

57:48.907 --> 57:50.456
It's not that, it's just um...

57:50.628 --> 57:51.836
I'm too old?

57:51.929 --> 57:54.296
You know my father is 15
years older than my mother?

57:54.453 --> 57:55.984
And they've been happily married

57:56.109 --> 57:57.922
-for 40 years.
-Tom, please. Stop.

57:59.452 --> 58:02.790
I just never thought
about you that way.

58:03.142 --> 58:04.644
I'm sorry.

58:15.618 --> 58:17.798
It's uh, about Jack, isn't it?

58:18.039 --> 58:19.719
I really don't think that's
any of your concern.

58:19.828 --> 58:21.477
You don't know
the first thing about him.

58:21.593 --> 58:24.030
You have no idea...

58:25.127 --> 58:27.214
what you are getting into.

58:35.181 --> 58:37.025
I am only trying to protect you.

58:37.152 --> 58:40.564
You know, I can get you out of
this place where you don't belong.

58:42.053 --> 58:43.889
You should think about that.

01:00:04.588 --> 01:00:06.023
Scoundrel?

01:00:08.154 --> 01:00:09.907
Where have you been?

01:00:51.265 --> 01:00:54.609
Better not bite me,
or I'll turn you into lunch.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.561
Come on out of there.

01:01:16.764 --> 01:01:18.663
Do not be afraid.

01:02:26.805 --> 01:02:27.954
Thomas D. Porter.

01:02:27.993 --> 01:02:29.938
<i>Mr. Porter, This
is Sam Gouldman.</i>

01:02:30.058 --> 01:02:31.453
Mr. Gouldman!

01:02:32.258 --> 01:02:34.351
What a pleasure to hear from you.
Actually, I was just finishing...

01:02:34.429 --> 01:02:35.765
<i>Well, we just came out
of a board meeting</i>

01:02:35.883 --> 01:02:37.874
<i>and after some heartfelt
deliberations,</i>

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:39.194
<i>important decisions
have been made</i>

01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:40.945
<i>about the future of our firm.</i>

01:02:41.708 --> 01:02:42.765
I'm all ears.

01:02:42.874 --> 01:02:44.671
<i>The time has come
for us to grow.</i>

01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:46.570
<i>So, instead of the
position we spoke about,</i>

01:02:46.655 --> 01:02:50.178
<i>we have decided to offer you
to become a partner in our firm.</i>

01:02:50.753 --> 01:02:52.130
<i>How's that sound?</i>

01:02:52.312 --> 01:02:54.107
Well, I'm honored, sir.

01:02:55.087 --> 01:02:57.541
But just to make
sure I understand...

01:02:57.611 --> 01:02:59.745
<i>We're offering you the
great opportunity</i>

01:02:59.839 --> 01:03:02.354
<i>of buying ten percent
of our shares.</i>

01:03:05.285 --> 01:03:06.454
<i>Are you there?</i>

01:03:07.668 --> 01:03:10.699
And how much are we
talking about roughly?

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.816
<i>Well, it's a little
neighborhood south of $5,000.</i>

01:03:12.918 --> 01:03:15.550
<i>I assume this
won't be a problem.</i>

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:18.235
<i>Right, Mr. Porter?</i>

01:03:18.547 --> 01:03:19.635
Right.

01:03:20.604 --> 01:03:23.679
But the position is still
secured, if I just want to...

01:03:23.743 --> 01:03:25.704
<i>I believe I've made
my point clear.</i>

01:03:26.148 --> 01:03:30.886
<i>What we need right now is a
partner, not an employee.</i>

01:03:33.101 --> 01:03:34.270
<i>Porter?</i>

01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:37.895
<i>Porter?</i>

01:03:38.035 --> 01:03:40.049
Well, I'll have to think about it, then.

01:03:40.121 --> 01:03:41.998
<i>Well, don't sit on it too long.</i>

01:03:42.191 --> 01:03:45.106
<i>If you're not interested, we have
to move on to our next candidate.</i>

01:03:45.298 --> 01:03:47.071
<i>I'm sure you understand it.</i>

01:03:47.558 --> 01:03:49.144
<i>I'll call you Monday.</i>

01:03:51.502 --> 01:03:54.034
Thank you, Mr. Gouldman.
Thank you.

01:04:23.173 --> 01:04:25.611
No! No! No!

01:04:25.845 --> 01:04:27.181
No. No.

01:05:03.806 --> 01:05:05.064
Billy?

01:05:14.495 --> 01:05:15.664
Jane?

01:05:47.388 --> 01:05:49.611
How's your mother feeling today?

01:05:51.699 --> 01:05:53.455
It seems we have
a problem, Jack.

01:05:55.083 --> 01:05:57.837
I can't be an accomplice
to a forgery.

01:05:58.708 --> 01:06:00.161
Please.

01:06:00.348 --> 01:06:02.706
I'm just trying
to look after my family.

01:06:03.197 --> 01:06:04.551
You lied to me.

01:06:04.976 --> 01:06:06.609
You tried to cheat me
and in doing so,

01:06:06.679 --> 01:06:08.694
you made me an accessory
in your little charade.

01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:11.053
So, I think it's fair you offer
me some kind of compensation.

01:06:11.131 --> 01:06:12.263
We have nothing!

01:06:12.334 --> 01:06:15.470
You have 10,000 pounds and
you will hand them over to me

01:06:15.544 --> 01:06:18.947
so I can get out of this cowshit
and wear real shoes again.

01:06:24.244 --> 01:06:26.736
Now I assume you will
discuss this with your siblings.

01:06:29.712 --> 01:06:31.150
I'll come by tomorrow.

01:06:46.453 --> 01:06:48.103
What are we going to do?

01:06:51.288 --> 01:06:53.172
We threw that money
down the chimney.

01:06:53.341 --> 01:06:55.533
We have no way of
getting it back now.

01:06:56.507 --> 01:06:57.973
It's all over.

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:44.854
Ah!

01:11:55.131 --> 01:11:57.014
Billy, give me-give me...

01:11:57.112 --> 01:11:58.373
Give me that!

01:11:58.533 --> 01:12:01.244
-Yeah, hold this.
-Okay, okay.

01:12:01.342 --> 01:12:02.302
Ah!

01:12:02.357 --> 01:12:03.623
-Billy.
-What? What?

01:12:03.724 --> 01:12:05.006
What have you done?

01:12:06.698 --> 01:12:07.776
You...

01:12:07.916 --> 01:12:10.690
You didn't dare to
tear down the wall.

01:12:11.009 --> 01:12:13.666
So...so it found another
way to the attic.

01:12:13.831 --> 01:12:15.620
Someone had to try and
get that money back.

01:12:15.645 --> 01:12:17.831
I told you not to go in there!

01:12:17.917 --> 01:12:19.444
He survived, Jack.

01:12:21.026 --> 01:12:23.559
Ah! He survived, Jack.

01:12:23.784 --> 01:12:25.947
He's been eating up there.

01:12:26.291 --> 01:12:28.807
I saw it with my own two eyes.

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:31.435
It will kill us all.
I saw it.

01:12:31.506 --> 01:12:33.944
The place is covered in--
in animal bones!

01:12:34.014 --> 01:12:35.467
Doves, raccoons, rats.

01:12:35.553 --> 01:12:38.256
You cou--You couldn't imagine
the stench in there.

01:12:38.316 --> 01:12:40.394
And he's found a way
to store rain water.

01:12:40.434 --> 01:12:41.495
It's the rain.

01:12:41.589 --> 01:12:44.160
-He's alive...again.
-He's alive this whole time.

01:12:45.472 --> 01:12:46.951
Get out, get out.

01:12:47.116 --> 01:12:49.286
-He's got to go.
-Please stop it.

01:12:49.357 --> 01:12:51.073
No! Stop it?

01:12:51.245 --> 01:12:54.458
Stop it? Is anybody listening to me?
He's still alive!

01:12:54.541 --> 01:12:56.073
And waiting to do
some more damage!

01:12:56.104 --> 01:12:57.261
I'm done with that
son of a bitch!

01:12:57.331 --> 01:12:58.367
You know I will.

01:12:58.476 --> 01:13:01.172
I will go up there and I will
end this, I swear to God!

01:13:01.279 --> 01:13:03.773
Are you listening to me?
Are you listening?

01:13:03.942 --> 01:13:05.177
Jack!

01:13:06.802 --> 01:13:07.803
Jack!

01:13:14.707 --> 01:13:15.551
Jack.

01:13:15.692 --> 01:13:17.800
Shh, calm, Jack.

01:13:17.996 --> 01:13:19.246
Shh. Jack!

01:13:22.613 --> 01:13:23.699
Jack!

01:13:25.226 --> 01:13:27.039
We have to tell Allie.

01:13:35.901 --> 01:13:37.940
She's the only one
who can help him.

01:13:38.521 --> 01:13:40.096
No, she'll be scared, she...

01:13:40.205 --> 01:13:42.062
She won't want to see him again.

01:13:42.202 --> 01:13:44.367
She loves him, Billy.

01:13:44.612 --> 01:13:47.741
The only thing that matters
now is saving Jack.

01:13:48.488 --> 01:13:50.992
We have to tell Allie the truth.

01:16:15.499 --> 01:16:16.843
Hello?

01:16:29.673 --> 01:16:31.175
Anybody home?

01:16:31.701 --> 01:16:33.788
I've come for my money!

01:16:34.304 --> 01:16:35.565
Hello!

01:17:51.362 --> 01:17:54.675
<i>"The day we locked father up
was a day like any other.</i>

01:17:55.128 --> 01:17:58.387
<i>Nothing could have warned us
that he finally found us".</i>

01:18:09.818 --> 01:18:10.874
Jack!

01:18:17.015 --> 01:18:18.203
Sam!

01:18:18.437 --> 01:18:19.606
Take Sam.

01:18:19.898 --> 01:18:21.107
Come on, this way!

01:18:21.205 --> 01:18:23.288
-Let me go with you.
-No, you stay with Jane and Sam.

01:18:23.355 --> 01:18:24.686
No! Jack!

01:18:25.718 --> 01:18:27.187
-Jack!
-Jack?

01:18:27.318 --> 01:18:28.654
Should be safe here.

01:18:28.734 --> 01:18:30.140
Hey, Jack!

01:18:31.121 --> 01:18:32.401
-Jack!
-I will deal with him.

01:18:32.481 --> 01:18:34.419
Jack! No, Jack!

01:18:37.435 --> 01:18:38.981
I've got it!

01:18:39.556 --> 01:18:41.141
I'm right here!

01:18:42.678 --> 01:18:44.931
This is between you and me!

01:18:51.515 --> 01:18:54.598
Stay away from the house
and I will give it back!

01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:39.760
It was me and me alone.

01:19:40.872 --> 01:19:42.374
I ratted you out.

01:19:42.549 --> 01:19:43.916
I took your money.

01:19:44.697 --> 01:19:46.468
They had nothing to do with it.

01:19:47.072 --> 01:19:48.682
Take it

01:19:48.876 --> 01:19:50.486
and leave us alone.

01:21:48.330 --> 01:21:49.517
Jack?

01:22:11.636 --> 01:22:13.250
Kill him, Billy.

01:23:27.185 --> 01:23:28.548
I'm coming!

01:23:28.903 --> 01:23:30.405
I'm coming!

01:23:35.121 --> 01:23:36.189
Sam!

01:23:36.665 --> 01:23:38.251
Sam, I'm coming!

01:23:44.237 --> 01:23:45.489
Jane.

01:23:47.921 --> 01:23:50.686
Jane, Billy, Sam!

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:04.208
Sam!

01:24:13.194 --> 01:24:16.366
Open the door, Jack.

01:24:32.832 --> 01:24:35.574
If you dare.

01:24:50.283 --> 01:24:52.428
What have you done?!

01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:56.963
What have you done?!

01:24:57.232 --> 01:25:00.070
Jane, Billy, Sam!

01:25:00.757 --> 01:25:02.510

01:25:03.004 --> 01:25:04.798
Please, Jane, Billy!

01:25:26.556 --> 01:25:28.849

keep you safe.

01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:32.828

It all starts here.

01:28:07.428 --> 01:28:09.598
Our story begins here.

When we cross that line,

01:28:15.429 --> 01:28:17.766

Tom?

01:30:30.917 --> 01:30:32.503
Did you hear that?

01:30:33.578 --> 01:30:35.581
There's someone outside.

01:30:40.389 --> 01:30:43.684
I am in command,
when Jack is gone.

01:30:44.348 --> 01:30:45.498
You can't.

01:30:45.764 --> 01:30:46.787
Shh.

01:30:48.131 --> 01:30:49.451
Be quiet.

01:30:51.146 --> 01:30:52.146
It's fine.

01:30:52.241 --> 01:30:53.960
Sam, don't be scared.

Nothing.

01:31:03.467 --> 01:31:04.468
No one.

01:31:05.982 --> 01:31:07.318
No one.

01:31:07.629 --> 01:31:08.708
No one.

01:31:09.935 --> 01:31:11.061
Ever.

01:31:12.170 --> 01:31:13.756
We are one.

01:31:14.261 --> 01:31:16.181
We are one.

01:31:17.429 --> 01:31:19.098
We are one.

01:31:19.289 --> 01:31:21.487
I've still got my bullet,
I can go up there!

01:31:21.618 --> 01:31:23.549
I-I can finish this.

01:31:23.956 --> 01:31:26.084
Billy, we can't.

01:31:26.389 --> 01:31:29.212
He's trying to keep us here.
He won't let me move.

01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:31.463
Stop fighting.

01:31:31.711 --> 01:31:32.672
Shh.

01:31:34.005 --> 01:31:34.991
Jack.

01:31:36.617 --> 01:31:39.370
Jack's sleeping,
his head hurts.

01:31:49.375 --> 01:31:51.434
Jack tried to kill himself.

01:31:52.358 --> 01:31:54.110
That's why we came back.

01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:59.139
Please, Allie.

01:32:01.028 --> 01:32:03.781
We need you
to take care of Jack.

01:32:23.076 --> 01:32:24.693
Jane?

01:32:29.779 --> 01:32:31.418
Forgive me.

01:32:32.804 --> 01:32:33.719
What?

01:32:36.125 --> 01:32:37.359
You.

01:32:37.467 --> 01:32:39.137
You can't be here.

01:32:39.562 --> 01:32:41.163
They'll go if you stay.

01:32:41.751 --> 01:32:43.421
Please leave us alone.

01:32:43.625 --> 01:32:44.836
Jack, you're bleeding.

01:32:45.109 --> 01:32:46.474
-Jane.
-Let me see.

01:32:46.827 --> 01:32:48.038
Sam.

01:32:49.809 --> 01:32:50.811

01:32:51.172 --> 01:32:52.164
Ow!

01:32:54.611 --> 01:32:56.489
Let me look, Jack. Stop it.

01:32:57.741 --> 01:32:59.244
I know everything.

01:32:59.301 --> 01:33:00.303
Jack.

01:33:00.531 --> 01:33:02.455
-Jack, look at me.
-Where are they?

01:33:03.156 --> 01:33:04.117
-Sam.
-Jack.

01:33:04.327 --> 01:33:05.710
-Sam!
-Jack.

01:33:06.156 --> 01:33:07.585
-Jane! Jane!
-Jack.

01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:09.507
Jack, look at me. Stop it!

01:33:09.575 --> 01:33:10.538
-Jane.
-Stop.

01:33:10.648 --> 01:33:11.859
-Sam. Get off.
-Stop it. Stop

01:33:11.914 --> 01:33:12.836
-No!
-Stop it!

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:15.507
-Jack.
-Please. They'll go if you stay.

01:33:19.573 --> 01:33:21.412
I couldn't keep them safe.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.382
No.

01:33:23.851 --> 01:33:25.031
Just leave us alone!

01:33:25.148 --> 01:33:27.999
Please, please leave us alone.

01:33:28.955 --> 01:33:30.541
Leave us alone.

01:33:36.447 --> 01:33:37.532
Go!

01:33:40.056 --> 01:33:41.802
-Go!
-No.

01:33:43.393 --> 01:33:44.394
Go!

01:34:07.289 --> 01:34:08.374
Tom?

01:35:06.215 --> 01:35:07.384

01:35:27.907 --> 01:35:29.117
Tom!

01:35:31.611 --> 01:35:34.150
Tom, let me see.
Okay? Just...

01:35:37.674 --> 01:35:38.926
Jack!

01:35:45.681 --> 01:35:47.353
Tom, who did this to you?

01:36:23.119 --> 01:36:24.834
Jack, help me!

01:36:26.761 --> 01:36:27.763
Jack!

01:36:31.098 --> 01:36:32.350
Jack.

01:37:09.956 --> 01:37:11.715
Why are you hiding?

01:37:16.963 --> 01:37:19.043
You think you can scare me?

01:37:20.707 --> 01:37:23.264
Well, don't think for a second
it's gonna be that easy.

01:37:23.391 --> 01:37:24.824
Come out of there!

01:37:25.722 --> 01:37:27.488
I'm not alone.

01:37:31.647 --> 01:37:33.223
You can hear them
within these walls

01:37:33.301 --> 01:37:35.489
and you know what?
I can hear them too.

01:37:37.329 --> 01:37:39.173
You thought you could put out
their light like a candle,

01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:40.220
but you can't.

01:37:40.424 --> 01:37:41.425
Allie.

01:37:42.293 --> 01:37:44.546
You don't have that power.

01:37:55.124 --> 01:37:57.211
You're the one who's dead.

01:38:00.258 --> 01:38:01.385
Jane.

01:38:04.321 --> 01:38:06.911
Sam, Billy, I know
you can hear me!

01:38:07.085 --> 01:38:08.735
I know you're there.

01:38:10.314 --> 01:38:12.290
Billy, come out of there.

01:38:13.354 --> 01:38:14.440
Billy!

01:38:14.765 --> 01:38:17.186
Jack, let me do this.

01:38:26.287 --> 01:38:27.587
No!

01:38:39.884 --> 01:38:41.362
Get away from her!

01:38:49.011 --> 01:38:50.873
You don't belong here.

01:38:52.221 --> 01:38:54.084
This is our place.

01:40:28.659 --> 01:40:30.982
<i>What you're telling me
is very good news.</i>

01:40:31.125 --> 01:40:35.420
Twelve weeks where Jack has had
no episodes of multiple personality.

01:40:35.591 --> 01:40:40.138
Jane, Billy and Sam had finally
gone to sleep in Jack's mind.

01:40:40.307 --> 01:40:42.701
But such a trauma

01:40:42.930 --> 01:40:45.263
may have unpredictable
consequences on his mind,

01:40:45.404 --> 01:40:47.052
so we have to be vigilant.

01:40:48.054 --> 01:40:51.617
I know we have
discussed this before.

01:40:51.703 --> 01:40:54.047
But you are a
healthy young woman

01:40:54.118 --> 01:40:56.485
with a bright future
ahead of you.

01:40:56.758 --> 01:41:01.125
<i>I don't understand why you
choose to live in a house</i>

01:41:01.242 --> 01:41:04.648
<i>that will always bear the
memory of that terrible event.</i>

01:41:05.211 --> 01:41:06.838
<i>It will be sad.</i>

01:41:06.981 --> 01:41:08.025
Jack?

01:41:08.183 --> 01:41:09.685
<i>It will be lonely.</i>

01:41:09.893 --> 01:41:13.323
<i>He is a mentally ill man who can
never take proper care of you.</i>

01:41:13.477 --> 01:41:14.478
Jack?

01:41:14.596 --> 01:41:16.229
<i>There's no reason
why you should</i>

01:41:16.283 --> 01:41:19.055
<i>carry that burden for
the rest of your life.</i>

01:41:24.652 --> 01:41:27.572
<i>Love cannot grow
in a sick mind.</i>

01:41:31.547 --> 01:41:33.861

to live with Jack.</i>

01:42:48.308 --> 01:42:50.562

01:43:07.149 --> 01:43:08.909
