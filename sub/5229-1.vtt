01:17.115 --> 01:19.075
[narrator]
This is a story about clothing.

01:19.826 --> 01:21.828
It's about the clothes we wear,

01:21.911 --> 01:23.913
the people who make these clothes,

01:23.997 --> 01:26.499
and the impact that it's having
on our world.

01:29.752 --> 01:32.463
It's a story about greed and fear,

01:32.547 --> 01:34.340
power and poverty.

01:35.466 --> 01:38.928
It's complex, as it extends
all the way around the world.

01:39.262 --> 01:40.555
But it's also simple,

01:40.930 --> 01:44.392
revealing just how connected we are
to the many hearts and hands

01:44.475 --> 01:45.977
behind our clothes.

01:51.482 --> 01:54.485
I came into this story
with no background in fashion at all,

01:54.569 --> 01:57.572
beginning with nothing more
than a few simple questions.

01:57.655 --> 01:59.115
What I've discovered

01:59.199 --> 02:02.076
has forever changed the way
I think about the things I wear,

02:02.493 --> 02:07.081
and my hope is that
it might just do the same for you.

02:19.928 --> 02:22.263
[interviewer]
Maybe just start and say your name

02:22.347 --> 02:25.266
and talk about how this kind of began.

02:25.350 --> 02:26.559
My name is Lucy Siegle.

02:26.643 --> 02:30.313
I am a journalist and broadcaster
based in the UK,

02:30.396 --> 02:34.067
and I have been obsessed, consumed

02:34.150 --> 02:38.613
with the environmental and social impacts
of the fashion industry

02:38.696 --> 02:40.698
for about a decade.

02:40.782 --> 02:43.284
[woman]
Well, I love everything about clothes.

02:43.368 --> 02:48.081
I love the poetry, I love the fabric,
I love the colors, I love the textures,

02:48.164 --> 02:53.419
I love the way that they make you feel.
You know, they are our chosen skin.

02:53.878 --> 02:58.466
Well, I had the classic massive closet,

02:58.550 --> 03:00.093
clothes everywhere,

03:00.176 --> 03:03.137
bags constantly coming into my house,
you know,

03:03.221 --> 03:05.807
every day, every other day
with some other item in,

03:05.890 --> 03:10.895
and never had anything to wear. I could
never put together a coherent outfit.

03:13.606 --> 03:15.275
[de Castro]
We communicate who we are

03:15.358 --> 03:17.151
to a certain extent through clothing.

03:17.235 --> 03:19.863
And this is, this is again,
throughout history.

03:19.946 --> 03:22.156
You know, you have the trends at court,

03:22.240 --> 03:25.201
and Marie Antoinette
making these huge hats.

03:25.285 --> 03:28.913
It's always been our personal
communication in many ways.

03:28.997 --> 03:30.957
That's what interests me,

03:31.040 --> 03:35.712
that it is fundamentally a part of what,
um, we wish to communicate

03:35.795 --> 03:37.213
about ourselves.

03:43.094 --> 03:45.513
[Siegle] We used to have a system,
a fashion system

03:45.597 --> 03:47.724
where people would go to the, uh, shows,

03:47.807 --> 03:50.476
so they would do spring, summer,
autumn, winter,

03:50.560 --> 03:53.271
and those kind of ran like clockwork
for very many years.

03:53.354 --> 03:55.773
"Okay, rip that up,
throw it out the window."

03:55.857 --> 03:59.527
That has absolutely nothing to do
with the fashion industry today.

03:59.611 --> 04:01.779
It has been re-invented.

04:01.863 --> 04:06.075
[de Castro]
The shift is moving ruthlessly, um,

04:06.159 --> 04:09.621
towards a way of producing

04:09.704 --> 04:14.042
which only really looks after

04:14.542 --> 04:16.293
big business interest.

04:18.296 --> 04:20.005
Growing up, I never gave much thought

04:20.089 --> 04:22.926
to anything other than the price
of the clothes that I bought,

04:23.009 --> 04:25.845
usually making choices
based on the style or a good deal.

04:26.930 --> 04:29.015
Looking back,
I learned that for a long time

04:29.098 --> 04:31.935
most of our clothing was actually
made right here in America.

04:32.519 --> 04:36.731
As recently as the 1960s, we were
still making 95 percent of our clothes.

04:37.357 --> 04:39.817
Today, we only make about 3 percent

04:39.901 --> 04:41.861
and the other 97 percent is outsourced

04:41.945 --> 04:44.405
to developing countries around the world.

04:49.410 --> 04:52.330
[man] I've been in the business
for over nine years now.

04:52.413 --> 04:56.876
In terms of scale, we've got 25,000 people
just on garment manufacturing side.

04:56.960 --> 05:00.171
We produce one in six dress-shirts
sold in the U.S.

05:02.674 --> 05:04.300
If you actually go to a store

05:04.384 --> 05:08.680
and you benchmark the price
of a garment over the last 20 years,

05:08.763 --> 05:11.891
you will find that there's actually
a deflation of the product,

05:11.975 --> 05:13.893
i.e., the price has gone down over time.

05:13.977 --> 05:16.646
Now, has our cost gone down?
Absolutely not. Okay?

05:16.729 --> 05:18.314
Our cost has gone up.

05:18.982 --> 05:20.984
The more production we've outsourced,

05:21.067 --> 05:23.570
the cheaper prices have become
on the clothing we buy,

05:23.653 --> 05:27.198
making way for a whole new model,
known as "Fast Fashion,"

05:27.282 --> 05:31.703
almost overnight, transforming
the way clothing is bought and sold.

05:32.245 --> 05:35.039
[woman] The newest H&M store
on 5th Avenue in Manhattan

05:35.123 --> 05:36.875
is the company's largest ever

05:36.958 --> 05:40.044
and just one of many new stores
it's planning around the country.

05:40.128 --> 05:43.756
[man] It's all part
of a high street revolution, Fast Fashion.

05:43.840 --> 05:48.052
And instead of two seasons a year,
we practically have 52 seasons a year.

05:48.136 --> 05:50.513
So, we have something new
coming in every week.

05:50.597 --> 05:53.057
And Fast Fashion has created this,

05:53.141 --> 05:55.685
so that it can essentially shift
more products.

06:02.817 --> 06:05.111
[all screaming]

06:05.195 --> 06:06.821
[crowd]
We love Topshop!

06:07.238 --> 06:10.575
[man] You can get this fringe
metallic skirt $39 at Joe Fresh,

06:10.658 --> 06:12.076
a brand-new store in town.

06:12.160 --> 06:15.872
With price tags that might look
a little bit more appealing to shoppers.

06:15.955 --> 06:17.081
[man]
American consumers,

06:17.165 --> 06:20.793
they really have grasped
the fashion part of H&M,

06:20.877 --> 06:24.005
and we know that American consumers are
very value-oriented.

06:24.088 --> 06:27.008
If you match these two together,
with fashion and value,

06:27.091 --> 06:28.259
then you have a recipe.

06:28.343 --> 06:30.970
[woman]
One Japanese clothing retailer is making

06:31.054 --> 06:33.932
a fast and furious mark here in the U.S.

06:34.015 --> 06:35.642
The price has dropped.

06:35.725 --> 06:40.021
The way of making that product
has completely, completely changed.

06:40.104 --> 06:42.315
And you have to ask yourself
at some point,

06:42.398 --> 06:43.775
"Where does it end?"

06:43.858 --> 06:45.944
The global marketplace is some place

06:46.027 --> 06:48.655
where we export work to have happen

06:48.738 --> 06:52.450
in whatever conditions we want,
and then the products come back to me,

06:52.534 --> 06:55.161
cheap enough to throw away
without thinking about it.

06:58.081 --> 07:00.917
Globalized production basically means

07:01.000 --> 07:02.710
that all of the making of goods

07:02.794 --> 07:05.964
has been outsourced to low-cost economies,

07:06.047 --> 07:09.634
particularly where wages are very low
and kept low.

07:09.717 --> 07:13.596
And what that means is that those
at the top of the value chain,

07:13.680 --> 07:16.641
they get to choose
where the products are being made,

07:16.724 --> 07:20.228
and they get to switch if, for example,
one factory says,

07:20.311 --> 07:22.188
"We can't make it that cheap anymore."

07:22.272 --> 07:24.774
The brand will say,
"We're not gonna come to you.

07:24.858 --> 07:27.610
We're gonna switch to another place
which is cheaper."

07:36.077 --> 07:39.247
[man] In the West,
they're using "everyday low price."

07:39.581 --> 07:42.041
So, every day, they're hampering me,

07:42.125 --> 07:44.502
and I'm hampering my workers,
this is how it is.

07:44.586 --> 07:46.838
They're competing.
The stores are competing.

07:46.921 --> 07:50.216
When the stores are coming to us
for an order and negotiating,

07:50.300 --> 07:51.551
they're telling, "Look,

07:51.634 --> 07:55.722
that particular store is selling
this shirt, like, for $5,

07:55.805 --> 07:58.391
so I need to sell it at $4.

07:58.474 --> 08:01.060
So you better squeeze your price."
So we are squeezing.

08:01.144 --> 08:05.064
Then other store is coming and saying,
"Hey, they're selling it at $4?

08:05.148 --> 08:07.483
So the target price is 3.
If you can make that 3,

08:07.567 --> 08:10.153
you're getting business,
otherwise you are not getting."

08:10.236 --> 08:12.780
Because we want that business so badly,

08:12.864 --> 08:15.491
and we don't have other options, okay.

08:15.575 --> 08:18.453
Every time we are trying
to survive, actually.

08:19.329 --> 08:21.289
[Lee]
Ultimately, something's gonna give.

08:21.372 --> 08:23.666
Either the price
of the product has to go up,

08:23.750 --> 08:27.086
or manufacturers have to shut down

08:27.170 --> 08:28.838
or cut corners to make it work.

08:29.339 --> 08:32.049
[narrator] Cutting corners
and disregarding safety measures

08:32.133 --> 08:35.178
had become an accepted part
of doing business in this new model,

08:35.260 --> 08:36.929
until an early morning in April,

08:37.013 --> 08:39.557
when an event just outside
of Dhaka, Bangladesh

08:39.640 --> 08:42.393
brought a hidden side of fashion
to front page news.

08:42.477 --> 08:44.354
State media in Bangladesh say

08:44.437 --> 08:48.024
an eight-story building has collapsed
near the capital of Dhaka,

08:48.107 --> 08:49.776
killing more than 70 people.

08:49.859 --> 08:52.487
[crowd clamoring]
[whistle blowing]

08:55.990 --> 08:59.702
[wailing in foreign language]

09:02.080 --> 09:04.666
[woman 1]
Rescue workers are racing against time,

09:04.749 --> 09:07.210
searching through the rubble,
trying to find

09:07.293 --> 09:09.587
as many survivors as they can.

09:09.671 --> 09:11.089
[man 1]
Hundreds are dead,

09:11.172 --> 09:14.759
hundreds more might still be buried alive,
after officials in Bangladesh say

09:14.843 --> 09:17.720
factory owners ignored
an order to evacuate.

09:17.804 --> 09:22.183
[man 2] Some 400 dead,
hundreds still believed to be missing.

09:22.267 --> 09:26.396
Garment workers in Bangladesh paying
the price for cheap clothing.

09:26.479 --> 09:29.357
[woman 2] A huge crowd has gathered
near the building site,

09:29.440 --> 09:32.902
many of them family members looking
for loved ones,

09:32.986 --> 09:35.697
and they say they can still hear
people screaming

09:35.780 --> 09:39.033
from underneath the rubble,
crying out for help.

09:39.117 --> 09:41.786
Many are simply losing hope.

09:43.246 --> 09:45.248
[speaking in foreign language]

09:54.424 --> 09:55.717
[clears throat]

10:16.487 --> 10:19.574
[Siegle]
Anybody who, like me,

10:19.657 --> 10:23.453
had written about problems
in the supply chain,

10:23.536 --> 10:25.663
particularly for Fast Fashion,

10:25.747 --> 10:27.999
and tried to articulate

10:28.082 --> 10:31.377
how the risk was being carried

10:31.461 --> 10:35.673
by those who are most vulnerable
and the worst paid.

10:36.299 --> 10:39.719
You try to articulate that,
but you could never have envisaged

10:39.802 --> 10:43.056
that there would be such
a catastrophic illustration

10:43.139 --> 10:45.225
of what you were trying to say.

10:45.308 --> 10:49.187
And Rana Plaza, to me,
was like some horror story.

10:50.104 --> 10:52.148
[woman]
Two weeks after the catastrophe

10:52.232 --> 10:56.361
and the death toll now stands
at a staggering 931,

10:56.444 --> 11:00.114
making it the worst
garment-industry disaster in history.

11:00.198 --> 11:04.452
I think one of the most profoundly
impressing things

11:04.536 --> 11:08.540
about the Rana Plaza disaster
was that news

11:08.623 --> 11:12.085
that the workers had already
pointed out to the management

11:12.168 --> 11:13.711
the cracks in the building.

11:13.795 --> 11:15.713
They'd already pointed out

11:15.797 --> 11:18.383
that the building was structurally unsafe,

11:18.466 --> 11:20.760
and yet they'd been forced back in.

11:20.844 --> 11:22.303
[woman]
Survivors are asking

11:22.387 --> 11:24.848
how they could've been forced
to return to work

11:24.931 --> 11:28.476
when management already was aware
of the cracks in the building,

11:28.560 --> 11:31.771
and workers' concerns
on the very day of the collapse.

11:31.855 --> 11:35.108
A lot of clothes in American stores
are made in Bangladesh

11:35.191 --> 11:37.819
by workers who earn about $2 a day.

11:37.902 --> 11:41.239
Last month there,
a garment factory collapsed,

11:41.322 --> 11:43.616
killing more than 1,000,

11:43.700 --> 11:48.621
and a few months before that,
a factory fire killed more than 100.

11:48.705 --> 11:51.332
[woman] And as bodies are
being pulled out of the rubble,

11:51.416 --> 11:54.502
another factory in Bangladesh caught fire
early this morning,

11:54.586 --> 11:56.004
killing eight more people.

11:56.671 --> 12:00.633
[narrator] As story after story
of disasters kept filling the news,

12:00.717 --> 12:04.012
it was now the case that three
of the four worst tragedies...

12:04.095 --> 12:08.016
...in the history of fashion had
all happened in the last year.

12:08.099 --> 12:11.227
As the death toll rose,
so did the profits generated.

12:11.311 --> 12:13.980
The year following the disaster
at Rana Plaza was

12:14.063 --> 12:17.108
the industry's most profitable
of all time.

12:17.192 --> 12:19.235
The global fashion industry is now

12:19.319 --> 12:22.197
an almost $3 trillion annual industry.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.490
[man]
Bangladesh is now the second largest

12:24.574 --> 12:26.910
apparel exporter, after China.

12:26.993 --> 12:29.621
How? Well, unlike some
of its competitors,

12:29.704 --> 12:32.916
Bangladeshi manufacturing remains
dirt cheap,

12:32.999 --> 12:35.376
and unions have limited power.

12:35.460 --> 12:40.173
The country cornered the absolute bottom
of the value chain.

12:40.548 --> 12:44.886
Those 1000 poor girls lost their lives

12:44.969 --> 12:49.974
because everybody didn't bother,
didn't give a damn shit.

12:50.058 --> 12:53.061
They just wanted the cheap price
and a good profit.

12:53.144 --> 12:54.729
It shouldn't be like that.

12:54.812 --> 12:58.107
Everybody should take
the responsibility for those kids.

13:02.904 --> 13:04.489
That's how it is.

13:05.657 --> 13:07.283
There might be more coming.

13:07.367 --> 13:11.746
Sorry, but you know that it's not only
the price pressure,

13:11.829 --> 13:13.039
it is something--

13:13.122 --> 13:14.916
Ignoring other people's lives.

13:14.999 --> 13:18.336
It's not... It shouldn't...
It's not right.

13:18.419 --> 13:20.338
It's the 21st century.

13:20.421 --> 13:22.131
It's a global world we are living in,

13:22.215 --> 13:25.134
and we just ignore other people's lives?

13:25.218 --> 13:26.344
How come?

13:26.427 --> 13:30.390
This enormous, rapacious industry

13:30.473 --> 13:32.809
that is generating so much profit

13:32.892 --> 13:35.061
for a handful of people,

13:35.144 --> 13:37.605
why is it that it is unable

13:37.689 --> 13:41.317
to support millions
of its workers properly?

13:41.401 --> 13:45.613
Why is it that it is not able
to guarantee their safety?

13:45.697 --> 13:47.782
We're talking
about essential human rights.

13:47.866 --> 13:49.868
Why is it unable to guarantee that

13:49.951 --> 13:52.996
whilst generating
these tremendous profits?

13:53.079 --> 13:54.998
Is it because it doesn't work properly?

13:55.081 --> 13:56.374
That is my question.

13:58.042 --> 14:00.545
[narrator] Lucy's question sounds
like the obvious one.

14:00.628 --> 14:03.631
But instead of answering it,
everywhere I looked, I found people

14:03.715 --> 14:05.842
who were constantly justifying the cost

14:05.925 --> 14:08.511
because of the economic benefits
being generated.

14:08.595 --> 14:12.849
So, this low-wage manufacturing,
or so-called "sweatshops,"

14:12.932 --> 14:15.643
they're not just the least bad option
workers have today,

14:15.727 --> 14:18.855
they're part of the very process
that raises living standards

14:18.938 --> 14:22.400
and leads to higher wages
and better working conditions over time.

14:22.483 --> 14:27.071
Your proximate causes of development
are physical capital, technology

14:27.155 --> 14:29.324
and human capital
or skills of the workers.

14:29.407 --> 14:33.703
When sweatshops come to these countries,
they bring all three to these workers

14:33.786 --> 14:36.039
and start getting that process going.

14:36.122 --> 14:39.501
Is it possible that sweatshops are
actually good?

14:39.584 --> 14:41.503
Yes, horrible, awful sweatshops.

14:41.586 --> 14:43.338
The word itself, "sweatshop,"

14:43.421 --> 14:46.382
it evokes terrible images
of poor people and children

14:46.466 --> 14:50.220
suffering in third world countries,
slaving away in awful conditions

14:50.303 --> 14:53.181
to make products
for us selfish Americans.

14:53.264 --> 14:54.974
And thank you. What?

14:55.058 --> 14:59.187
Does it bother me that people
are working in a factory,

14:59.270 --> 15:02.857
making clothes for Americans

15:02.941 --> 15:04.943
or for, you know, Europeans?

15:05.026 --> 15:07.904
Or that they're... That's how
they're spending their lives?

15:08.821 --> 15:10.782
Is that what you're kind of asking me?

15:10.865 --> 15:12.659
[interviewer]
Um, yeah, sure.

15:12.742 --> 15:14.202
Um...

15:14.285 --> 15:17.330
No. I mean, you know,
they're doing a job.

15:17.747 --> 15:20.500
Uh, there are a lot worse things
that they can be doing.

15:20.583 --> 15:22.585
It is live television,
and I will ask you:

15:22.669 --> 15:24.087
define sweatshops.

15:24.170 --> 15:27.215
We have to be clear
what we're talking about from the outset.

15:27.298 --> 15:30.301
So, we're talking about places
with very poor working conditions

15:30.385 --> 15:32.720
as us normal Americans
would experience it,

15:32.804 --> 15:36.266
very low wages by our standard,
maybe children working places

15:36.349 --> 15:38.142
that might not obey local labor laws,

15:38.226 --> 15:42.355
but there are characteristics of the ones
I want to talk to you about tonight,

15:42.438 --> 15:45.191
and that's they're places
where people choose to work,

15:45.275 --> 15:47.735
admittedly from a bad set
of other options.

15:48.194 --> 15:51.489
Well, there's nothing intrinsically
dangerous with sewing clothes.

15:51.573 --> 15:53.616
[chuckles] So, we're kind of starting out

15:53.700 --> 15:57.120
with, you know,
a relatively safe industry.

15:57.203 --> 16:00.123
It's not like coal mining,
or natural gas mining,

16:00.206 --> 16:03.668
or a lot of things that you could--
That are much more dangerous.

16:03.751 --> 16:07.881
So, sweatshop jobs look like
horrible working conditions and wages

16:07.964 --> 16:10.341
to anybody in the West
who's wealthy enough

16:10.425 --> 16:12.927
to own a TV and watch your video.

16:13.011 --> 16:15.763
But we have to keep in mind
that the alternatives available

16:15.847 --> 16:18.057
for these workers aren't
our own alternatives,

16:18.141 --> 16:20.435
they're much worse than our alternatives,

16:20.518 --> 16:24.022
and they're usually much worse
than the factory job that the worker has.

16:24.731 --> 16:28.693
Low wages, unsafe conditions,
and factory disasters

16:28.776 --> 16:31.362
are all excused because of
the needed jobs they create

16:31.446 --> 16:33.573
for people with no alternatives.

16:34.073 --> 16:36.117
This story has become the narrative,

16:36.201 --> 16:39.162
used to explain the way
the fashion industry now operates

16:39.245 --> 16:40.955
all over the world.

16:41.039 --> 16:44.042
But there are those who believe
that there must be a better way

16:44.125 --> 16:47.587
of making and selling clothing
that does generate economic growth,

16:47.670 --> 16:50.173
but without taking such an enormous toll.

16:50.548 --> 16:52.759
[woman]
So, we don't know yet, um,

16:52.842 --> 16:54.677
how long this embroidery is taking.

16:54.761 --> 16:57.931
Do you think you could ask Santo
to just roughly...

16:58.014 --> 17:00.600
How long that whole panel is taking?

17:00.683 --> 17:04.479
I guess we'll see it in the FAB breakdown,
but it would be great to know.

17:04.561 --> 17:08.858
So, I'm Safia Minney,
I'm founder and CEO of People Tree,

17:08.942 --> 17:11.611
and, uh, People Tree is
a Fair Trade fashion brand

17:11.694 --> 17:14.364
that started over 20 years ago in Japan.

17:14.739 --> 17:16.741
You were worried we had too much navy.

17:16.824 --> 17:20.118
What are you feeling now?
Because we did put more black in to SS14

17:20.203 --> 17:22.454
and that has worked really, really well

17:22.539 --> 17:26.709
with, um, Orla's designer, um,
collaboration.

17:26.792 --> 17:29.587
Have we got enough black prints
in the collection?

17:29.671 --> 17:34.759
Uh, well, we've lost
that abstract dust print, this one here,

17:34.843 --> 17:37.637
in the black,
but I think this pink, we really---

17:38.304 --> 17:42.392
It's one of those prints that everyone's
nervous of but actually will do well.

17:43.309 --> 17:46.187
[Minney]
I think most fashion brands start

17:46.271 --> 17:49.440
with a concept
of a collection or a look.

17:49.524 --> 17:53.695
Um, they don't tend to think,
uh, you know,

17:53.778 --> 17:56.114
who is gonna make the product?

17:56.197 --> 17:59.242
And how can I ensure
that producers

17:59.325 --> 18:02.495
or suppliers, um, are gonna eat?

18:02.579 --> 18:08.084
So, what we're trying to do at People Tree
is start with the skills that we have

18:08.168 --> 18:11.421
at each producer group,
and then design the collection up,

18:11.504 --> 18:15.675
whilst also looking at the integrity
of the collection in its aesthetic.

18:16.926 --> 18:20.054
I worked originally
with freelance designers

18:20.138 --> 18:24.100
and went into Bangladesh, Zimbabwe,
India, Nepal, the Philippines,

18:24.184 --> 18:27.979
and bit by bit, we put together,
you know, an amazing network

18:28.062 --> 18:31.191
of like-minded Fair Trade organizations

18:31.274 --> 18:33.860
that put women's development,

18:33.943 --> 18:36.529
the workers' social development
and environment

18:36.613 --> 18:39.157
absolutely essential
to everything they do.

18:44.746 --> 18:46.581
[woman]
One, two, three.

18:46.664 --> 18:49.667
[all]
Happy World Fair Trade Day!

18:49.751 --> 18:51.878
[cheering and whistling]

18:54.005 --> 18:56.007
[speaking in Japanese]

19:29.374 --> 19:31.376
[instrumental music playing
over speakers]

19:47.976 --> 19:49.894
[speaks in Japanese]

19:53.815 --> 19:55.191
Thank you.

19:56.150 --> 20:00.363
Good job! It was so...
Really, really great!

20:00.446 --> 20:01.823
Yeah.

20:04.909 --> 20:06.911
[speaking in Japanese]

20:13.793 --> 20:15.587
[speaks in Japanese]

20:16.546 --> 20:17.797
That's beautiful.

20:17.881 --> 20:20.258
Fair Trade is a citizen's response

20:20.341 --> 20:22.343
to correcting the social injustice

20:22.427 --> 20:25.847
in an international trading system
that is largely dysfunctional,

20:25.930 --> 20:29.225
where, uh, workers and farmers

20:29.309 --> 20:31.895
are not paid, um, a living wage,

20:31.978 --> 20:36.900
and where the environment is not
considered to make the products we buy.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.993
[speaks in foreign language]

20:52.540 --> 20:54.542
[speaking in foreign language]

21:07.055 --> 21:10.099
Shima is one of about
40 million garment-factory workers

21:10.183 --> 21:11.184
in the world.

21:11.267 --> 21:14.312
Almost four million of these workers
are here in Bangladesh,

21:14.395 --> 21:16.523
working in almost 5000 factories,

21:16.606 --> 21:19.275
making clothing for major Western brands.

21:21.361 --> 21:23.947
Over 85 percent
of these workers are women.

21:24.030 --> 21:26.783
And with a minimum wage
of less than $3 a day,

21:26.866 --> 21:29.953
they are among the lowest paid
garment workers in the world.

21:30.036 --> 21:32.455
[Akhter speaking in foreign language]

21:59.899 --> 22:00.900
[interviewer]

22:00.984 --> 22:02.235
[Akhter]

22:36.227 --> 22:41.482
[man] The workers must not have
any kind of distrust

22:41.566 --> 22:43.610
on their owners.

22:43.693 --> 22:45.361
If they have,

22:46.029 --> 22:51.159
there will not be any good
working atmosphere in the factory.

22:51.242 --> 22:55.997
They must respect,
the owner is paying us as per rule.

22:57.916 --> 23:00.043
If they do not have
this kind of confidence,

23:00.126 --> 23:02.003
you won't get the result.

23:02.879 --> 23:05.173
[Akhter speaking in foreign language]

23:56.349 --> 23:59.018
It's estimated that one
in every six people alive

23:59.102 --> 24:00.436
in the world today

24:00.520 --> 24:03.314
work in some part
of the global fashion industry,

24:03.398 --> 24:06.818
making it the most
labor-dependent industry on earth.

24:07.819 --> 24:11.322
Most of this work is done by people,
like Shima, who have no voice

24:11.406 --> 24:13.032
in the larger supply chain.

24:13.408 --> 24:16.703
But to fully understand the impact
that fashion is having on our world,

24:16.786 --> 24:19.539
we have to go back
to where it all begins.

24:21.082 --> 24:22.834
[engine starts]

24:24.794 --> 24:27.213
[woman] My grandparents settled
out here in the '20s,

24:27.297 --> 24:29.215
and so this is a part of my heritage.

24:29.299 --> 24:32.510
People ask why I'm a cotton farmer,
it's 'cause I don't know better.

24:32.594 --> 24:34.470
My granddaddy was an old German farmer

24:34.554 --> 24:37.765
that felt like we should respect the land,
we're stewards of the land,

24:37.849 --> 24:39.851
and respect the life that's in the land.

24:41.936 --> 24:45.440
You are actually sitting in,
uh, the high plains of Texas,

24:45.523 --> 24:49.152
and there's 3.6 million acres
of cotton growing in this region.

24:49.235 --> 24:51.905
We're literally the biggest
cotton patch in the world.

24:52.280 --> 24:56.367
In just the past ten years,
80 percent of that is now GMO,

24:56.451 --> 24:58.494
genetically modified cotton.

24:58.578 --> 25:00.955
Most of it is, uh, Roundup Ready,

25:01.039 --> 25:04.792
meaning that instead
of the farmers spot-spraying weeds,

25:04.876 --> 25:06.252
occasionally, in their field,

25:06.336 --> 25:09.756
or hiring laborers to walk the field
and eliminate the weeds,

25:09.839 --> 25:12.717
now they're spraying whole fields.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.427
Cotton produces the fiber

25:14.511 --> 25:17.764
that's responsible for most
of the clothing worn by the world today.

25:17.847 --> 25:19.933
And as our appetite
for fashion grows,

25:20.016 --> 25:23.311
the cotton plant itself is being
re-engineered to keep up.

25:23.394 --> 25:25.063
There's been this big drive

25:25.146 --> 25:27.690
towards the industrialization
of agriculture,

25:27.774 --> 25:30.276
the intensification of agriculture.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.487
So, instead of the old forms of farming,

25:32.570 --> 25:34.948
which were very much in-tune with nature,

25:35.031 --> 25:36.991
they were linked to the cycles

25:37.075 --> 25:39.744
of the natural year and the seasons,

25:39.827 --> 25:41.704
what you see now is an intensification

25:41.788 --> 25:45.750
where the land is almost reconsidered
as if it was a factory.

25:47.377 --> 25:50.213
[man] What you've created is
this general practice

25:50.296 --> 25:54.467
of "we treat millions of acres the same."

25:54.551 --> 25:57.720
We put a dose of chemical on it all,

25:57.804 --> 26:01.516
and that's when you get
these big ecological effects

26:01.599 --> 26:05.019
that nobody has a grasp
of what's really happening.

26:05.645 --> 26:09.774
Nature tends to heal itself
in small pockets.

26:10.525 --> 26:14.779
But when you get this big,
broad approach,

26:15.989 --> 26:18.241
we really don't know what's going on.

26:18.324 --> 26:21.619
For us, it's not reducing
the amount of pesticides

26:21.703 --> 26:25.415
and chemicals going on the cotton,
that's one of the big-- It reduces that.

26:25.498 --> 26:27.917
Not in our area, where we are spraying

26:28.001 --> 26:31.880
millions and millions of acres
and dollars of Roundup

26:31.963 --> 26:33.840
across the entire South Plains.

26:33.923 --> 26:36.509
What kind of impact is
that having on our soil,

26:36.593 --> 26:40.513
with residuals that are left
at the microbacterial level?

26:40.597 --> 26:44.017
What kind of impact is that having
on the people in our communities?

26:44.100 --> 26:46.519
Where is the cost on that?

26:50.440 --> 26:52.483
[man] Monsanto is proud
to be the leader

26:52.567 --> 26:53.943
in agricultural innovation,

26:54.027 --> 26:57.113
because of what these agricultural
advancements can do to help you,

26:57.197 --> 26:59.616
double yields for the future needs
of the world.

27:00.241 --> 27:02.952
We're dedicated to the future
of agriculture

27:03.036 --> 27:05.038
and providing farmers with innovations

27:05.121 --> 27:08.208
that help them produce more
and conserve more,

27:08.291 --> 27:11.419
while improving the lives
of people around the world.

27:11.503 --> 27:13.838
Together, we can face the challenges

27:13.922 --> 27:15.340
of the next generation

27:16.841 --> 27:18.384
and beyond.

27:29.145 --> 27:30.480
[woman]
After the wars,

27:30.563 --> 27:32.482
where all these redundant factories

27:32.565 --> 27:37.695
that made war chemicals,
explosives, uh, were lying around,

27:40.156 --> 27:44.160
the Western countries thought
that it would be a good idea

27:44.244 --> 27:46.246
to market them to the third world.

27:46.329 --> 27:49.123
After all, the same industry
that makes explosives

27:49.207 --> 27:51.084
makes nitrogen fertilizers.

27:51.543 --> 27:53.962
And they started
to push nitrogen fertilizers,

27:54.420 --> 27:58.007
from the '50s onwards,
after we became independent.

27:58.091 --> 28:04.848
But the nitrogen fertilizers don't do
very well with native crops.

28:04.931 --> 28:07.267
There's a problem of lodging.

28:07.350 --> 28:10.311
So, the whole system then organized itself

28:10.395 --> 28:12.313
to redesign the plant

28:12.397 --> 28:15.108
in order to take on more chemicals.

28:15.191 --> 28:19.362
Bt Cotton is a cotton in which
a gene has been added,

28:19.445 --> 28:22.699
from a bacteria, to produce a toxin.

28:22.782 --> 28:24.659
But the Bt Cotton,

28:25.451 --> 28:27.412
which is supposed to control a pest,

28:28.037 --> 28:33.626
has been offered because it's a way
for companies to own the seed.

28:34.252 --> 28:37.005
[narrator] By patenting
these genetically modified plants,

28:37.088 --> 28:41.259
Monsanto has become the largest seed
and chemical corporation in history.

28:41.342 --> 28:44.179
I wanted to speak with someone
who'd worked with the company,

28:44.262 --> 28:47.015
and I got word that a former
managing director for India

28:47.098 --> 28:48.266
was willing to talk.

28:48.349 --> 28:50.894
[man] One of my close friends
in the research division,

28:50.977 --> 28:53.646
working on these modified crops,

28:53.730 --> 28:55.940
he came to my hotel for a drink.

28:57.275 --> 29:00.278
We are sitting having a drink,
and after a few drinks he told me,

29:00.361 --> 29:03.698
"Hey, Jag, they're going to change
the type of business

29:03.781 --> 29:05.491
you're doing in India."

29:06.284 --> 29:08.119
I said, "What do you mean?"

29:08.203 --> 29:10.580
"They're going to get
into seeds business.

29:10.663 --> 29:15.251
And they're going to make
the seed business of all crops,

29:15.335 --> 29:17.921
so that we have a monopoly on seeds,

29:18.338 --> 29:22.425
and every farmer has to come to us
to buy seeds every time."

29:24.010 --> 29:26.054
That rang a bell in my mind.

29:26.721 --> 29:30.934
If a poor farmer has to go
to Monsanto to buy seeds every time,

29:31.976 --> 29:34.479
and such expensive seeds,

29:34.562 --> 29:36.814
at the time there's no idea
of Bt at all for me.

29:36.898 --> 29:39.692
Genetically modified seed,
it's not in my mind.

29:40.443 --> 29:43.863
Even seed monopoly
is something very bad.

29:44.364 --> 29:46.991
[Shiva] So farmers get into debt
when they get the seed

29:47.075 --> 29:50.370
because of the high cost,
17,000 percent more.

29:50.453 --> 29:53.998
They get into deeper debt because
it doesn't deliver on the promise

29:54.082 --> 29:57.460
of controlling pests,
so they have to buy more pesticides.

29:57.544 --> 30:01.506
The tragedy with chemicals,
whether it's fertilizers or pesticides,

30:01.589 --> 30:04.884
is that they are what has been called
ecological narcotics:

30:04.968 --> 30:07.387
the more you use them,
the more you need to use them.

30:07.470 --> 30:10.014
For a while, the yield
of the single commodity climbs

30:10.098 --> 30:11.558
and then it starts to decline

30:11.641 --> 30:14.894
because you have contaminated the soil.

30:22.068 --> 30:25.071
Most of India's cotton is grown
in the Punjab region,

30:25.154 --> 30:29.075
which has quickly become
the largest user of pesticides in India.

30:30.368 --> 30:32.787
Dr. Pritpal Singh has
been studying the effects

30:32.871 --> 30:34.581
of these chemicals on human health,

30:34.664 --> 30:38.459
and his reports show dramatic rise
in the number of birth defects,

30:38.543 --> 30:41.588
cancers and mental illness
here in the region.

30:58.396 --> 30:59.981
[boy whimpering]

31:56.162 --> 32:00.208
Companies that make the GM seeds
and make the chemicals

32:00.291 --> 32:01.751
are the same companies.

32:01.835 --> 32:04.546
And they're also the same companies
that make the medicines

32:04.629 --> 32:05.964
which they are now patenting.

32:06.047 --> 32:08.341
So you get cancer,
there are more profits.

32:08.424 --> 32:10.468
For them it's a win, win, win.

32:10.552 --> 32:13.805
As for nature and people,
it's a lose, lose, lose.

32:14.222 --> 32:16.891
It's the day those agents
of these companies

32:16.975 --> 32:19.060
come to the farmer and say,

32:19.143 --> 32:21.855
"You owe me this much.
You haven't paid back.

32:21.938 --> 32:23.940
Now your land is my land."

32:24.023 --> 32:26.985
That day the farmer will go
into his field,

32:27.068 --> 32:29.571
drink a bottle of pesticide,

32:29.654 --> 32:30.780
and end his life.

32:30.864 --> 32:32.782
And every widow I've talked to said,

32:32.866 --> 32:36.411
"And the neighbors came and said
they found my husband lying in the field."

32:37.453 --> 32:38.538
[speaking indistinctly]

32:38.621 --> 32:40.331
In the last 16 years,

32:40.415 --> 32:42.750
there have been more than 250,000

32:42.834 --> 32:45.753
recorded farmer suicides in India.

32:46.713 --> 32:49.382
That's about one farmer every 30 minutes.

32:49.465 --> 32:53.511
And it's the largest recorded wave
of suicides in history.

33:00.226 --> 33:04.189
As it becomes clear just how much
of an impact fashion is having,

33:04.272 --> 33:06.107
there's an increasing amount of research

33:06.191 --> 33:09.527
to suggest that it's also having
a growing effect on us,

33:09.611 --> 33:11.487
the people buying these clothes.

33:11.905 --> 33:15.658
What we now know 20 years later,
and hundreds of studies later,

33:15.742 --> 33:19.245
is that the more the people are focused
on those materialistic values,

33:19.329 --> 33:22.540
the more that they say
that money and image

33:22.624 --> 33:25.877
and status and possessions
are important to them,

33:25.960 --> 33:27.295
the less happy they are,

33:27.378 --> 33:30.548
the more depressed they are,
the more anxious they are.

33:30.632 --> 33:33.718
We know that all of these kinds
of psychological problems

33:33.801 --> 33:37.222
tend to go up
as materialistic values go up.

33:37.305 --> 33:41.976
Now, that's really at odds
with the thousands of messages

33:42.060 --> 33:45.605
that we receive every day
from, uh, advertisements

33:45.688 --> 33:49.484
suggesting that materialism
and the pursuit of possessions

33:49.567 --> 33:51.861
and owning stuff
is what's gonna make us happy.

33:51.945 --> 33:56.157
It's important to understand
that advertising is a species

33:56.241 --> 33:58.493
or a category of propaganda.

33:58.993 --> 34:03.623
You think of propaganda
as a totalitarian thing, very grim,

34:03.706 --> 34:07.126
loudspeakers, you know,
chanting crowds and so on,

34:07.210 --> 34:08.503
and we think of Hitler.

34:08.585 --> 34:11.380
We always think of it
as a foreign thing, okay,

34:11.464 --> 34:13.882
but it's actually as American
as apple pie.

34:17.846 --> 34:20.849
[Kasser] Well, the reason
that advertising works is because

34:20.931 --> 34:22.934
the smart advertisers, at least,

34:23.016 --> 34:26.728
are trying to tie the consumption
of their product

34:26.813 --> 34:30.358
to a message that suggests

34:30.440 --> 34:32.902
that your needs will be satisfied

34:32.985 --> 34:35.071
by consuming this thing.

34:35.154 --> 34:36.822
It wants you to believe

34:36.906 --> 34:39.074
that you'll look wonderful in that thing.

34:39.158 --> 34:40.909
But then to put it on and feel like,

34:40.994 --> 34:43.996
"Nah, you look kind of fat in it,
you don't look that good in it,

34:44.080 --> 34:47.208
you're sorry you bought it,
but there's another one you can buy."

35:15.278 --> 35:19.240
[Kasser] So think of all of the car
commercials you see that show,

35:19.324 --> 35:22.285
"Well, I've really made it now,
I'm a competent person

35:22.368 --> 35:26.164
because I'm driving this BMW
or this Audi."

35:26.247 --> 35:28.833
Or think of all the shampoo
commercials you've seen,

35:28.917 --> 35:32.170
where the person now
has beautiful flowing hair

35:32.253 --> 35:35.423
and is loved and appreciated
by the people around them.

35:35.507 --> 35:37.467
The basic message is the same:

35:37.550 --> 35:40.220
the way to solve
the problems of your life,

35:40.303 --> 35:42.096
we all have problems in our life,

35:42.180 --> 35:45.475
the way to solve the problem in your life
is through consumption.

35:45.558 --> 35:46.768
Hey, you guys!

35:46.851 --> 35:49.729
Today I am coming to you guys
with a clothing haul!

35:49.812 --> 35:53.358
I went shopping a couple days ago
and literally went insane

35:53.441 --> 35:55.527
and bought so many things.

35:55.610 --> 35:58.905
My spam box, I don't know,
where it's literally blown up,

35:58.988 --> 36:01.282
by you guys saying
you guys wanted a haul.

36:01.366 --> 36:03.409
So, here it is.

36:03.493 --> 36:07.163
Okey-dokey, so first off,
I have some things that I got from H&M.

36:07.247 --> 36:09.541
So, then I went to Forever 21.

36:09.624 --> 36:12.752
It wasn't even a question,
it was just fate. I had to get it.

36:12.836 --> 36:15.922
Like, if it could levitate towards me,
it would have levitated.

36:16.005 --> 36:17.715
I got this skirt,

36:18.258 --> 36:22.303
bright yellow, and it was $8.50.

36:22.387 --> 36:25.431
It's a jean button-up thing.

36:25.515 --> 36:28.518
And I just loved this,
I just loved it, loved it, loved it!

36:28.601 --> 36:31.479
It's a gray knit sweater,
and it has pink hearts all over it.

36:31.563 --> 36:33.857
I loved... I love tie-dye things.

36:33.940 --> 36:36.484
Like tie-dye things are literally
the bomb.net.

36:36.568 --> 36:39.028
It has a little yin yang sign
on the front of it.

36:39.112 --> 36:40.488
I just love these so much.

36:40.572 --> 36:44.075
And it's just this really pretty,
light blue sweater.

36:44.158 --> 36:47.745
I don't know if I'm gonna wear this.
I don't know if I like it that much.

36:47.829 --> 36:49.747
I need to stop.

36:55.628 --> 36:57.172
[man]
I try to understand better

36:57.255 --> 37:01.092
why people don't realize that they're
becoming poorer and poorer.

37:01.176 --> 37:04.470
And I ask myself, okay,
but what has changed

37:04.554 --> 37:06.222
in respect of when I was young?

37:06.306 --> 37:09.434
And fashion is something
that has dramatically changed.

37:09.517 --> 37:12.312
I was able to buy one, two T-shirts,

37:12.395 --> 37:14.439
four T-shirts, for example, a year.

37:14.522 --> 37:17.567
Now, I mean, also my children,
they used to buy,

37:17.650 --> 37:19.944
every party, they buy a T-shirt.

37:20.028 --> 37:24.365
And so I understood that Fast Fashion
is something totally new.

37:24.449 --> 37:28.995
If you have noticed, the price has
decreased in the last years.

37:29.078 --> 37:33.416
And it does follow
the middle class disappearing.

37:33.499 --> 37:38.338
So all the things that people really need
are very costly,

37:38.421 --> 37:43.343
like a home, like studies,
like, uh, life insurance.

37:43.426 --> 37:47.388
On the other side,
there is a source of consolation,

37:47.472 --> 37:49.974
um, part of their life.

37:50.058 --> 37:53.811
They can, uh, buy a T-shirt,

37:53.895 --> 37:57.065
two T-shirts a party,
or eventually a day,

37:57.815 --> 38:00.318
although I'm very poor
and I've got lost--

38:00.401 --> 38:03.071
I've lost all the things
I really needed.

38:03.154 --> 38:05.990
Today we purchase over
80 billion pieces of new clothing

38:06.074 --> 38:07.116
each year.

38:07.200 --> 38:11.329
That's 400 percent more than the amount
we bought just two decades ago.

38:11.412 --> 38:14.582
The way we buy clothes
has changed so much, so fast

38:14.666 --> 38:16.626
that few people have
actually stepped back

38:16.709 --> 38:19.629
to understand the origin
of this new model or the consequence

38:19.712 --> 38:22.715
of such an unprecedented increase
in consumption.

38:22.799 --> 38:27.220
[Miller] There's, um,
an article in Printers' Ink,

38:27.303 --> 38:31.182
which is the leading
advertising trade journal of its day,

38:31.266 --> 38:35.562
uh, by a very famous copywriter,
named Earnest Elmo Calkins.

38:35.645 --> 38:39.607
He was a grand old man
of the art of writing advertising copy.

38:40.191 --> 38:42.652
It was an article called
"Consumptionism."

38:43.778 --> 38:48.408
In that article, he says
there are two kinds of products.

38:48.491 --> 38:51.995
Okay, there are the kind
that you use,

38:52.078 --> 38:54.998
like washing machines,
cars and so on,

38:55.081 --> 38:58.459
things that you buy
and use for a long time.

38:59.294 --> 39:01.713
And then there are
the things that you use up,

39:02.422 --> 39:05.550
like chewing gum and cigarettes,
other perishables.

39:06.009 --> 39:10.221
He said, uh, consumptionism
is all about getting people

39:10.305 --> 39:12.599
to treat the things they use

39:12.682 --> 39:14.726
as the things they use up.

39:14.809 --> 39:18.021
[woman] With their innovative
Buy 1, Get 3 Free pricing,

39:18.104 --> 39:19.522
a suit from Joseph A. Bank

39:19.606 --> 39:21.983
is effectively cheaper
than paper towels.

39:23.026 --> 39:25.862
And now they come
in these easy-to-use dispensers.

39:26.905 --> 39:29.949
With four suits for the price
of a modest dinner,

39:30.033 --> 39:33.203
I can feel good about
throwing them away when I'm done.

39:36.664 --> 39:40.210
You just have to look at landfill
and you can see in landfill

39:40.293 --> 39:43.129
that the amount of clothes
and textiles being chucked away

39:43.213 --> 39:46.424
has been increasing steadily
over the last ten years,

39:46.508 --> 39:49.928
um, as the sort of dirty shadow
of the Fast Fashion industry.

39:53.139 --> 39:55.850
[Siegle]
As we get sort of closer and closer

39:55.934 --> 39:58.061
to species degradation,

39:58.144 --> 40:02.065
to, uh, trashing our last remaining
pristine wilderness,

40:02.148 --> 40:05.652
we seem hell-bent on producing
more and more disposable stuff.

40:05.735 --> 40:07.237
It makes no sense.

40:07.320 --> 40:10.698
Fashion should never
and can never be thought of

40:10.782 --> 40:12.867
as a disposable product.

40:12.951 --> 40:15.328
[Dean] I think after any big change
in any industry,

40:15.411 --> 40:18.706
it takes a while to sort of feel and smell

40:18.790 --> 40:22.669
the dirt that comes out of something,
um, that is polluting.

40:22.752 --> 40:25.088
So, I think now there is a change

40:25.171 --> 40:28.675
because you can't deny

40:28.758 --> 40:30.593
that the Fast Fashion industry

40:30.677 --> 40:33.429
is having a massive impact
in developing countries.

40:33.888 --> 40:36.474
[narrator] The average American
throws away 82 pounds

40:36.558 --> 40:38.726
of textile waste each year.

40:38.810 --> 40:42.021
Adding up to more than
11 million tons of textile waste

40:42.105 --> 40:43.898
from the U.S. alone.

40:43.982 --> 40:46.651
Most of this waste is non-biodegradable.

40:46.734 --> 40:49.487
Meaning it sits in landfills
for 200 years or more,

40:49.571 --> 40:52.574
while releasing harmful gases
into the air.

40:52.657 --> 40:55.785
[de Castro] The sheer amount
of cheap clothing,

40:55.869 --> 40:59.706
even though people feel,
perhaps somehow,

40:59.789 --> 41:02.625
um, that they're offsetting
by giving to charity.

41:02.709 --> 41:06.504
You know, the journey of a T-shirt
donated to charity

41:06.588 --> 41:08.965
is unpalatable in itself.

41:11.968 --> 41:15.972
[woman] Pepe, um...
It is a disease in Haiti.

41:16.055 --> 41:19.726
Not only in Haiti, I think like in any
third world country that you're visiting.

41:19.809 --> 41:22.937
Like, you know...
It's a problem, it's a huge problem.

41:23.813 --> 41:26.482
Pepe, a bunch of clothes,

41:26.566 --> 41:29.694
most of them came from the States.

41:30.361 --> 41:33.114
People will go and buy
a box full of clothes.

41:33.198 --> 41:35.533
They don't even know what they're buying.

41:35.617 --> 41:39.078
Those are clothes
people donate to charity,

41:39.162 --> 41:43.416
and charity cannot sell them
on their thrift store or whatever.

41:43.499 --> 41:47.921
They pack them, ship them
to those third countries,

41:48.004 --> 41:50.006
and most of them end up here.

41:50.089 --> 41:53.051
It turns out that only about 10 percent
of the clothes we donate

41:53.134 --> 41:55.220
actually get sold
in local thrift stores.

41:55.303 --> 41:57.972
And as we're going through
our clothing faster and faster,

41:58.056 --> 42:02.185
now more of it is being dumped
into developing countries, like Haiti.

42:02.268 --> 42:05.647
As the amount of secondhand clothing
coming into Haiti has increased,

42:05.730 --> 42:08.525
the local clothing industry here
has disappeared.

42:09.108 --> 42:11.402
Once a proud, local tailoring sector,

42:11.486 --> 42:14.155
Haiti now produces mostly cheap T-shirts

42:14.239 --> 42:16.616
for export to America.

42:16.699 --> 42:19.118
[speaking in foreign language]

42:46.145 --> 42:50.567
[Charlot] So I'll tell people,
stop buying things that is not good,

42:50.650 --> 42:52.652
that is costing, like 10 dollars,

42:52.735 --> 42:56.281
you going to go on a ball,
you going out today.

42:56.364 --> 42:59.242
You just go to a store
and buy yourself a dress for 10 dollars.

42:59.325 --> 43:02.370
Because it cost 10 dollars
and I can throw it away.

43:02.453 --> 43:06.040
And tomorrow you are going to do the
same thing over and over and over again.

43:08.001 --> 43:10.920
As awareness of fashion's impact
on our world is growing,

43:11.004 --> 43:14.090
there are key leaders in the industry
who are beginning to question

43:14.174 --> 43:16.885
the impacts of a model
built on careless production

43:16.968 --> 43:18.928
and endless consumption.

43:19.012 --> 43:22.891
[man] At Patagonia,
we hate the word "consumers."

43:22.974 --> 43:24.309
[chuckles]

43:24.392 --> 43:27.687
We've got to find a better word,
we prefer, uh, "customers,"

43:27.770 --> 43:31.316
and we prefer also customers
who recognize

43:31.399 --> 43:33.735
the impact of their consumption.

43:33.818 --> 43:38.823
They recognize that, uh, as consumers,
they're part of the problem.

43:38.907 --> 43:44.078
Uh, we are hopeful that we can
encourage our customers to join us

43:44.162 --> 43:46.372
in really questioning consumption.

43:46.456 --> 43:48.625
Because without a reduction
in consumption,

43:48.708 --> 43:52.253
we don't feel that we'll really
collectively find a solution

43:52.337 --> 43:58.009
to the problems we face,
that are collectively, year by year, uh,

43:58.092 --> 44:01.763
resulting in the continued decline
of the, uh, health of our planet.

44:03.515 --> 44:06.267
[woman] I mean, the fashion industry
just needs to think.

44:06.351 --> 44:10.271
It needs to just stop and sort of look
at how it's been working

44:10.355 --> 44:13.858
in a conventional way, and just sort of
question it, challenge it.

44:13.942 --> 44:15.318
That's for me, as a designer,

44:15.401 --> 44:18.238
that's the most exciting thing
that I do now.

44:18.321 --> 44:21.241
More exciting than saying,
"Oh, I love this color this season,"

44:21.324 --> 44:23.826
or, "This is the silhouette
or the hemline."

44:23.910 --> 44:26.621
For me, a way bigger challenge

44:26.704 --> 44:29.123
and excitement is actually looking
at my industry

44:29.207 --> 44:34.212
and saying, "I'm gonna do it in a way
that is not as harmful to the planet."

44:35.004 --> 44:40.301
Business through advertising
has, uh, pulled society along

44:40.385 --> 44:45.098
into this belief that, uh, happiness is
based on stuff,

44:45.181 --> 44:47.684
that, uh, true happiness can
only be achieved

44:47.767 --> 44:52.981
with, you know, an annual,
seasonal, weekly, daily

44:53.064 --> 44:55.942
increase in the amount of stuff
you're bringing into your life.

44:56.025 --> 44:58.570
That we want to encourage
our customers

44:58.653 --> 45:00.905
to think twice about
those assumptions,

45:00.989 --> 45:03.533
to understand where they came from.

45:03.616 --> 45:06.911
And through that understanding,
to know that, uh, we can all together,

45:06.995 --> 45:08.580
we can change how this is done.

45:08.663 --> 45:11.374
The customer has to know
that they're in charge.

45:11.457 --> 45:13.418
Without them, we don't have jobs.

45:13.501 --> 45:15.253
And that is really important.

45:15.336 --> 45:17.005
So you don't have to buy into it.

45:17.088 --> 45:19.924
If you don't like it,
you don't have to buy into it.

45:22.927 --> 45:25.221
[Minney]
I love the embroidery, Shantu.

45:27.932 --> 45:29.350
The embroidery is really nice.

45:29.434 --> 45:32.061
You think we should have
the embroidery on both sides?

45:32.145 --> 45:35.523
I think we should definitely add
the embroidery here as well.

45:35.607 --> 45:38.401
I think it looks a bit mean
to have it just on the front,

45:38.484 --> 45:40.486
so let's have it on the sides, too.

45:41.613 --> 45:43.031
It won't add much cost,

45:43.114 --> 45:44.908
it's not so dense, is it?

45:44.991 --> 45:47.160
[indistinct chatter]

45:50.288 --> 45:53.458
Swallows is a fair trade
fashion business,

45:53.541 --> 45:56.252
but it's also a development society.

45:56.336 --> 46:00.590
So it helps more than 3000 people
in this village.

46:02.175 --> 46:03.843
I come here every four months.

46:03.927 --> 46:05.887
We call them "production trips."

46:05.970 --> 46:08.389
And, um, we're working
with the producers,

46:08.473 --> 46:10.558
trying to find out what are the barriers

46:10.642 --> 46:14.187
to making a great product
and to getting it to the market.

46:14.270 --> 46:16.814
And we're also doing
fair trade capacity building.

46:16.898 --> 46:19.526
So, looking at, you know,
what are the obstacles

46:19.609 --> 46:21.778
to delivering more social benefit

46:21.861 --> 46:25.949
or improving the environmental
protection in these areas?

46:26.032 --> 46:28.034
For me, this is about partnering.

46:28.117 --> 46:32.664
This is about finding creative solutions,
together with them, with the team here,

46:32.747 --> 46:37.252
and listening to what their problems are
and finding a way that works, together.

46:47.345 --> 46:52.767
I want to invite the best employee
here at Swallows,

46:52.851 --> 46:57.814
I want to invite one female
representative from Swallows

46:57.897 --> 47:02.235
to come to London in autumn
or next spring.

47:02.318 --> 47:04.028
And I would like you to think

47:04.112 --> 47:06.614
who would be that best representative.

47:07.240 --> 47:09.325
But I want you to know
who your customers are,

47:09.409 --> 47:11.911
and I want you to really
understand the marketplace

47:11.995 --> 47:14.497
and come back
and tell all your friends.

47:14.581 --> 47:16.875
[man speaking in foreign language]

47:19.419 --> 47:20.795
[Minney]
With you.

47:20.879 --> 47:22.338
[women laugh]

47:41.524 --> 47:44.319
Either, if she does it single thread,
single stitch,

47:44.402 --> 47:47.113
then maybe she needs
to do more densely?

47:47.197 --> 47:48.656
-Okay.
-More concentrated.

47:48.740 --> 47:51.034
[speaking in foreign language]

48:01.252 --> 48:04.672
So, um...
If she continues for a bit,

48:04.756 --> 48:07.550
we're gonna go up
to the sample room now, for SS15.

48:07.634 --> 48:11.221
Can she come and show us
the next one that she does?

48:11.304 --> 48:12.597
Yeah.

48:16.851 --> 48:19.562
[Minney] I hoped that People Tree
wouldn't be necessary,

48:19.646 --> 48:24.567
and I hoped that we would have
a trading system that looked after

48:24.651 --> 48:27.153
people's rights and the environment.

48:28.154 --> 48:30.698
But the more and more involved
I got in developing

48:30.782 --> 48:34.285
and working closely with partners,
the more,

48:34.369 --> 48:36.788
you know, dirt and filth I discovered

48:36.871 --> 48:40.458
about how trading practices
undermine everything that we believe in

48:40.542 --> 48:44.879
and everything I know
most people believe and value.

48:44.963 --> 48:46.464
Um...

48:47.674 --> 48:49.884
I don't know,
People Tree just grew organically.

48:49.968 --> 48:52.887
It grew from, um,
a really great collection of people

48:52.971 --> 48:55.640
that feel passionately
that there's a different way of...

48:55.723 --> 48:58.977
Of working, of living, of consuming,

48:59.060 --> 49:02.272
of, you know, interacting with people
by a humane way.

49:02.355 --> 49:03.565
Um...

49:03.648 --> 49:05.650
And, uh, you know,

49:05.733 --> 49:08.444
I didn't necessarily feel
that there'd be a thousand shops

49:08.528 --> 49:10.864
selling People Tree today, um,

49:10.947 --> 49:13.449
and I see that there's so much more
that we need to do.

49:13.533 --> 49:16.119
So, I think it's not just about,
you know, creating jobs

49:16.202 --> 49:18.413
for the 7000 people that work
for People Tree.

49:18.496 --> 49:21.457
It's also about being a catalyst
for change within the industry,

49:21.541 --> 49:23.543
and showing, proving the model works.

49:35.180 --> 49:36.806
[Pepper]
When we first went organic,

49:36.890 --> 49:39.058
there was only two or three of us
at the time,

49:39.142 --> 49:42.020
and we formed the Texas Organic
Cotton Marketing Cooperative,

49:42.103 --> 49:44.439
and the deal was they'd grow it
and I'd sell it.

49:44.522 --> 49:47.066
So, I started going to, like, Jacob Javits

49:47.150 --> 49:49.986
and having this whole deal,
cotton plants and everything,

49:50.069 --> 49:52.280
and of, "Yeah, we've got organic cotton,"

49:52.363 --> 49:55.909
and people would just look at us
like we were absolutely crazy.

49:57.911 --> 50:00.455
Many times consumers become aware

50:00.538 --> 50:03.082
of organic milk,
or they have an allergy.

50:03.166 --> 50:07.128
And so, interestingly enough, cotton,
and what they put on their body,

50:07.212 --> 50:09.714
even though the skin's
the largest organ on your body,

50:09.797 --> 50:11.549
isn't even on their radar screen

50:11.633 --> 50:15.220
because they're not getting the connection
of, "Oh, I eat this organic apple,

50:15.303 --> 50:17.764
therefore I'm not directly ingesting

50:17.847 --> 50:21.059
pesticides or chemicals,
or whatever the case may be."

50:21.142 --> 50:23.436
But they don't get that connection
with clothing.

50:23.520 --> 50:26.356
So, you have to start looking
in that bigger community scope.

50:26.439 --> 50:29.025
That it is about our air,
it's about our world.

50:29.108 --> 50:31.819
It's about our planet,
it's about our people.

50:31.903 --> 50:34.239
And so it is that awareness of--

50:34.322 --> 50:38.826
You may not feel that you're having direct
impact by buying this organic shirt.

50:39.536 --> 50:41.371
But the impact you're having

50:41.454 --> 50:43.873
is in the bigger picture
in the world at large,

50:43.957 --> 50:46.876
and especially in the community
where the cotton's grown.

50:59.430 --> 51:01.391
As the hard freeze comes,

51:01.474 --> 51:03.726
as organic farmers,
we wait for that freeze

51:03.810 --> 51:08.648
because that literally defoliates, uh,
takes the leaves off the plant,

51:08.731 --> 51:13.152
so that when we harvest,
the bolls open that are mature,

51:13.236 --> 51:14.654
and it leaves the cotton here,

51:14.737 --> 51:17.156
and you can see
it kind of comes out in sections.

51:17.240 --> 51:21.202
So, this, uh, machine that's coming
is called a Cotton Stripper.

51:21.286 --> 51:25.665
And it's called a Cotton Stripper
because it comes along and strips,

51:25.748 --> 51:28.168
uses kind of fingers,
and it literally strips

51:28.251 --> 51:32.005
all of the bolls off of this plant.

51:32.088 --> 51:34.257
So, when you look over there,
you can see

51:34.340 --> 51:37.760
the harvester's been there
and it's taken all the plants off.

51:48.229 --> 51:51.107
I think one of the problems
that we have in the current model

51:51.191 --> 51:53.109
is it's all about the profit.

51:53.193 --> 51:57.947
And it doesn't take into consideration:
"This cost at what cost?"

51:58.031 --> 52:01.492
The cost of polluting the water,
the cost of labor,

52:01.576 --> 52:03.119
the cost of bars on the window

52:03.203 --> 52:05.747
that people die when a fire breaks out
in the factory,

52:05.830 --> 52:08.708
the cost of farmers
that don't have access

52:08.791 --> 52:10.793
to education and health care.

52:10.877 --> 52:14.672
And so we haven't really factored in
what the true cost is.

52:20.136 --> 52:23.890
[man]
Kanpur is situated along river Ganga,

52:23.973 --> 52:26.476
which is the holiest river.

52:26.559 --> 52:31.940
And it's also very important
for 800 million Hindus,

52:32.023 --> 52:36.444
and also it serves as the lifeline
of North India.

52:36.528 --> 52:39.572
So, this river is being polluted
and killed

52:39.656 --> 52:43.076
by the leather factories of Kanpur.

52:45.036 --> 52:47.997
With growing demand
for materials like cheap leather,

52:48.081 --> 52:51.918
Kanpur is now
the leather export capital of India.

53:01.511 --> 53:05.306
Every day here, more than
50 million liters of toxic wastewater

53:05.390 --> 53:07.392
pour out of the local tanneries.

53:07.475 --> 53:10.395
Heavy chemicals used
to treat the leather like chromium-6

53:10.478 --> 53:13.398
flow into local farming
and even drinking water.

53:14.440 --> 53:17.652
In places like Kanpur,
far from the eyes of the world,

53:17.735 --> 53:20.446
major western brands are able
to source cheap materials

53:20.530 --> 53:24.576
while avoiding all accountability
for the growing cost to human health

53:24.659 --> 53:26.327
and the environment.

53:36.045 --> 53:42.093
People in that area are in the tight grip
of tannery pollution.

53:42.177 --> 53:47.599
The local environment is contaminated,
soil is contaminated.

53:47.682 --> 53:50.643
The only drinking water source,

53:50.727 --> 53:53.771
ground water, is contaminated
with chromium.

53:54.397 --> 53:56.232
Agricultural produce,

53:56.316 --> 53:59.736
even vegetables and, uh, salad items,

53:59.819 --> 54:01.905
are, uh, produced there.

54:01.988 --> 54:05.116
People's health is affected.

54:05.200 --> 54:08.661
People have different kinds
of dermal problems:

54:09.454 --> 54:12.165
skin rashes, boils, pustules,

54:12.248 --> 54:14.209
even numbness in the limbs.

54:14.292 --> 54:18.880
People have stomach ailments,
maybe they have cancers also.

54:20.381 --> 54:23.009
[speaking in foreign language]

54:59.170 --> 55:01.881
You can have the best
of materials moving

55:01.965 --> 55:07.345
into the high-end fashion market,
in Milan or Paris or London.

55:07.428 --> 55:11.850
But there has been so much work
which has gone behind it,

55:11.933 --> 55:14.435
and so much of chemicals has gone into it,

55:14.519 --> 55:17.188
the effluents have been discharging
to so many rivers.

55:17.272 --> 55:19.941
But we are only looking
at that point of time

55:20.024 --> 55:22.110
into the finished product.

55:22.193 --> 55:25.113
We need to step back and think about it.

55:28.324 --> 55:32.662
Fashion today is the number two
most polluting industry on earth,

55:32.745 --> 55:35.123
second only to the oil industry.

55:35.206 --> 55:37.584
The alarming thing is
that not only is fashion using

55:37.667 --> 55:39.377
a huge amount of natural resources

55:39.460 --> 55:41.921
and creating staggering
environmental impacts,

55:42.005 --> 55:46.050
these natural resources and this impact
is often not even measured.

55:46.134 --> 55:49.637
Because they've been
so abundant, these resources,

55:49.721 --> 55:53.224
uh, it's been assumed that they're going
to be there forever.

55:53.308 --> 55:57.437
Uh, so, I think business has
not accounted for them because, uh,

55:57.520 --> 55:59.814
it's only since the 1950s

55:59.898 --> 56:04.110
that we've really had
this industrial expansion

56:04.194 --> 56:08.323
at such a rate that we started
to see exponential growth

56:08.406 --> 56:11.201
and exponential use of natural resources.

56:11.284 --> 56:14.412
The first economy on which our lives rest
is nature's economy.

56:14.495 --> 56:16.623
Nature has an economy.

56:16.706 --> 56:20.543
That economy is huge.
It's not counted.

56:20.835 --> 56:23.922
Then we have people's economy,
women working, laborers working,

56:24.005 --> 56:25.548
farmers growing.

56:25.632 --> 56:28.968
And that was made invisible
through this construct,

56:29.052 --> 56:31.930
first in the Depression,
and then during the war years,

56:32.013 --> 56:36.184
of the number called the GDP,
the Gross Domestic Product,

56:36.267 --> 56:41.439
which measures only that which is traded,

56:41.523 --> 56:43.149
and has become a commodity.

56:43.233 --> 56:45.068
[Schragger]
A lot of the resources

56:45.151 --> 56:50.073
that we use to, uh, make
our clothing are not accounted for

56:50.156 --> 56:53.868
in the cost of producing those clothes.

56:53.952 --> 56:59.582
Uh, so one has, uh, water that's used
to produce clothing,

56:59.666 --> 57:03.169
land that's used to grow the fiber, uh,

57:03.253 --> 57:06.422
chemicals that, uh, are used to dye.

57:07.131 --> 57:10.969
Those things, uh, all are inputs.

57:11.427 --> 57:14.681
And as inputs, they cost something,

57:14.764 --> 57:17.642
uh, and they also give outputs,

57:17.725 --> 57:22.230
in some cases good outputs,
the clothing themselves, jobs,

57:22.313 --> 57:26.067
but in other cases bad outputs,
like harmful chemicals,

57:26.150 --> 57:28.152
or greenhouse gas emissions,

57:28.236 --> 57:30.405
and those things have costs as well.

[speaking in foreign language]

57:44.127 --> 57:46.671
[interviewer]

57:46.754 --> 57:48.298
[Akhter]

58:09.694 --> 58:11.696
[Nadia speaks in foreign language]

58:12.405 --> 58:14.574
[interviewer]

58:14.657 --> 58:16.117
[Akhter]

58:31.466 --> 58:34.177
The same low wages that have
made places like Bangladesh

58:34.260 --> 58:36.721
so attractive for brands to do business

58:36.804 --> 58:40.225
have left millions of workers here
working incredibly long hours,

58:40.308 --> 58:42.602
unable to afford
to keep their children with them,

58:42.685 --> 58:45.230
even in the cities' worst slums.

58:45.313 --> 58:47.649
In order to give their children
an education

58:47.732 --> 58:50.568
and the chance of a better future
than life in the factories,

58:50.652 --> 58:54.405
many garment workers here,
like Shima, are leaving their children

58:54.489 --> 58:58.076
to be raised by family or friends
in villages outside the city,

58:58.159 --> 59:00.954
only getting to see them
once or twice a year.

59:44.163 --> 59:46.332
[speaking in foreign language]

01:00:15.236 --> 01:00:17.530
[all speaking in foreign language]

01:00:48.686 --> 01:00:50.980
[speaking in foreign language]

01:02:20.862 --> 01:02:22.864
You know, we are actually profiting

01:02:22.947 --> 01:02:28.119
from their, um, need to work,
to use them as slaves.

01:02:28.203 --> 01:02:31.956
And I'm not saying that we don't--
We need to give them work,

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:36.544
but they have to be treated
with the same respect

01:02:36.628 --> 01:02:39.714
that we treat our children, our friends.

01:02:39.797 --> 01:02:41.341
They're not different from us.

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:44.219
Livia Firth has been calling
for major change

01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:45.512
in the fashion industry.

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:49.140
She made headlines by starting something
called "The Green Carpet Challenge,"

01:02:49.224 --> 01:02:50.892
urging celebrities and top designers

01:02:50.975 --> 01:02:53.811
to take part in more mindful forms
of fashion.

01:02:53.895 --> 01:02:56.814
She runs a sustainability
consulting firm called Eco Age

01:02:56.898 --> 01:03:00.860
and had just been invited to speak
on the future of fashion.

01:03:00.944 --> 01:03:03.238
[Firth] If Fast Fashion didn't exist,

01:03:03.321 --> 01:03:05.865
we wouldn't need to have
a summit in Copenhagen

01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:09.786
to try and clean the mess
of environmental destruction,

01:03:09.869 --> 01:03:13.164
social justice destruction,
that has been caused

01:03:13.248 --> 01:03:16.668
in the last 15 to 20 years
of its existence.

01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:19.504
Fast Fashion wants to produce fast,

01:03:19.587 --> 01:03:23.883
so the garment worker has
to produce faster and cheap.

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:27.846
So, the garment worker
is the only point of the supply chain

01:03:27.929 --> 01:03:30.098
where the margins are squeezed.

01:03:30.181 --> 01:03:33.935
And you have these huge,
you know, companies

01:03:34.018 --> 01:03:38.273
going to the factory in Bangladesh,
place an order for 1.5 million jeans

01:03:38.356 --> 01:03:42.110
for, you know, 30 cents each,
50 cents each...

01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:44.612
How can you make it ethical?
I don't know.

01:03:46.197 --> 01:03:48.783
But also, from the consumer point of view,

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:52.078
is it really democratic
to buy a T-shirt for $5

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:54.497
or pay $20 for your jeans?

01:03:54.581 --> 01:03:57.959
Or are they taking us for a ride?

01:03:58.042 --> 01:04:01.671
Because they're making us believe
that we are rich or wealthy

01:04:01.754 --> 01:04:03.882
because we can buy a lot.

01:04:03.965 --> 01:04:06.509
But in fact they are making us poorer.

01:04:06.593 --> 01:04:09.721
And the only person
who is becoming richer

01:04:09.804 --> 01:04:12.432
is the owner of the Fast Fashion brand.

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:14.893
So that makes me a little bit angry.

01:04:14.976 --> 01:04:16.978
[audience cheering and whistling]

01:04:22.817 --> 01:04:25.570
You spoke about a commitment

01:04:25.653 --> 01:04:31.576
to try and promise a basic living wage.

01:04:31.659 --> 01:04:33.286
What does that mean?

01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:37.498
Uh, how do you define
a fair living wage in Bangladesh?

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:41.044
You know, uh, what does that mean?

01:04:41.127 --> 01:04:44.130
And to have a pilot project
in three factories,

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:48.760
and by 2018, 15 percent of your factories
are going to have that?

01:04:48.843 --> 01:04:51.346
It's not good enough.
It's not.

01:04:51.429 --> 01:04:54.599
It's very clear for us
that what a living wage is,

01:04:54.682 --> 01:04:57.143
is something that the workers should say,

01:04:57.227 --> 01:05:01.481
and that's incorporated in our way
of working.

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:02.941
[Firth]
How much is it?

01:05:03.024 --> 01:05:05.109
And that's not for us to say a sum,

01:05:05.193 --> 01:05:07.570
but we do an assessment all the time.

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:08.780
How much is it?

01:05:08.863 --> 01:05:13.701
And to make sure that it covers
the basic needs of the workers.

01:05:13.785 --> 01:05:16.871
I can show you that later on.

01:05:16.955 --> 01:05:19.499
H&M has mastered the model
of Fast Fashion,

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:23.002
becoming the second largest
clothing corporation in history.

01:05:23.086 --> 01:05:26.673
With annual revenue
of more than $18 billion,

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:29.175
they are now one
of the largest producers of clothing

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:31.594
in both Bangladesh and Cambodia.

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:35.056
Sadly, along with every other
major retailer I asked,

01:05:35.139 --> 01:05:38.810
they declined
all interview requests for this film.

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:50.071
[crowd cheering]

01:05:50.154 --> 01:05:52.156
[man yelling in foreign language]

01:05:53.575 --> 01:05:56.286
In Cambodia,
garment workers have had enough.

01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:57.871
Recently taking to the streets

01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:00.915
to demand a minimum wage
increase in the country.

01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:09.841
As protests continued, workers were met
with violent crackdowns,

01:06:09.924 --> 01:06:13.511
as police began to open fire
with live rounds.

01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:15.722
[yelling in foreign language]

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:17.891
[wailing]

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:20.393
[crowd clamoring]
[car horns honking]

01:06:25.773 --> 01:06:27.609
[gunfire]

01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:35.867
[man] A woman has been killed
and several people injured

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:38.077
in clashes between clothes factory workers

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:40.413
and riot police in Cambodia.

01:06:41.247 --> 01:06:42.916
[gunfire]

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:48.213

[speaking in foreign language]

01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:17.825
For two days, Cambodia was a battleground.

01:07:17.909 --> 01:07:19.827
The city of Phnom Penh.

01:07:19.911 --> 01:07:24.165
The police, the paratroopers
were brought in

01:07:24.249 --> 01:07:28.545
as if there were war
on the streets of Phnom Penh.

01:07:28.628 --> 01:07:32.924
Why? Because workers
in the textile industry

01:07:33.007 --> 01:07:34.634
continued to demand

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:37.637
a minimum wage of at least $160.

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:43.142
[woman speaking in foreign language]

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:21.890
[man] Today is the, uh,
funeral of a factory worker.

01:08:21.973 --> 01:08:25.685
He was beaten to death.

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:32.024
He had, uh, suffered a lot
before his death this morning.

01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:35.944
And he had done nothing wrong.

01:08:36.029 --> 01:08:40.073
He, among his, uh, fellow workers,

01:08:40.992 --> 01:08:44.953
wanted to have better living conditions.

01:08:45.037 --> 01:08:47.040
[chanting in foreign language]

01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:07.644
[chanting continues]

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:14.859
We will continue his fight

01:09:15.734 --> 01:09:19.822
so that all Cambodian workers

01:09:20.782 --> 01:09:23.952
will have decent living conditions.

01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:26.787
[interviewer]
Thank you, sir.

01:09:35.462 --> 01:09:38.675
[narrator] The Cambodian government,
like other developing countries

01:09:38.758 --> 01:09:42.386
are desperate for the business
that multinational retailers bring.

01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:45.139
Because of the constant threat
that these brands

01:09:45.223 --> 01:09:47.767
will relocate production
to other low-cost countries,

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.853
the government holds down wages,

01:09:49.935 --> 01:09:53.106
routinely avoiding enforcement
of local labor laws.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:56.359
But because the major brands
do not officially employ the workers,

01:09:56.442 --> 01:09:59.112
or own any of the factories
they produce in,

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:01.155
they're able to profit hugely,

01:10:01.239 --> 01:10:03.616
all while remaining free
of responsibility

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:06.995
for the effects of poverty wages,
factory disasters,

01:10:07.078 --> 01:10:10.331
and the ongoing violent treatment
of workers.

01:10:10.415 --> 01:10:12.625
The whole system begins to feel

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:14.627
like a perfectly engineered nightmare

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:17.338
for the workers trapped inside of it.

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:24.053
[Mu] You cannot fool us,
and exploit our human resources,

01:10:24.137 --> 01:10:25.805
exploit our workers.

01:10:25.889 --> 01:10:28.391
The workers will continue to rise up.

01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:32.061
I call on the international brands

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:38.151
to put that struggle into dollars,

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:41.029
into pounds, into Euros.

01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:45.658
It translates into human capital.

01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:49.954
It translates into social responsibility

01:10:50.038 --> 01:10:51.789
of these big corporations.

01:10:51.873 --> 01:10:55.001
It translates into economic justice.

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:58.630
When everything is concentrated
on making profits

01:10:58.713 --> 01:11:00.298
for the big corporations,

01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:02.050
what you see is that human rights,

01:11:02.133 --> 01:11:05.678
the environment, workers' rights
get lost all together.

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:08.556
You see that workers
are increasingly exploited

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:12.268
because the price of everything
is pushed down and down and down,

01:11:12.352 --> 01:11:16.105
just to satisfy this impulse
to accumulate capital.

01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:18.233
And that's profoundly problematic,

01:11:18.316 --> 01:11:21.027
'cause it leads
to the mass impoverishment

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:24.322
of hundreds of millions of people
around the world.

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:29.494
[woman] If you write to these companies,
they'll send you their code of conduct.

01:11:29.577 --> 01:11:33.915
And it's beautiful, and it says,
"Oh, yes, we take responsibility

01:11:33.998 --> 01:11:36.709
for the conditions under which
our product is made,

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:38.503
you know, the product that you buy.

01:11:38.586 --> 01:11:40.296
All the factories where we produce,

01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:43.925
we require them to respect
the minimum-wage laws,

01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:46.427
you know,
all of the laws of the country,

01:11:46.511 --> 01:11:49.931
to respect women, not to hire children,

01:11:50.014 --> 01:11:52.559
uh, no forced labor,

01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:56.896
um, no excessive overtime hours,"
all that stuff.

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:58.231
Um...

01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:02.986
But when we submitted a bill
in Congress a few years ago,

01:12:03.069 --> 01:12:05.530
or worked with people to do that,

01:12:05.613 --> 01:12:10.076
we called it "The Decent Working
Conditions and Fair Competition Act,"

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:12.662
the companies responded in one voice,

01:12:12.745 --> 01:12:15.498
"Oh, no. That would be
an impediment to free trade.

01:12:15.582 --> 01:12:19.627
We can't have rules.
We can't have that."

01:12:19.711 --> 01:12:22.922
They want to keep it
with voluntary codes of conduct.

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:26.134
You know, they've fought for
and they've won laws

01:12:26.217 --> 01:12:29.971
to protect their stuff
and their interests,

01:12:30.054 --> 01:12:31.639
but what about the workers?

01:12:31.723 --> 01:12:34.267
The workers are left
with voluntary codes of conduct.

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:38.771
And what we see,
in case, after case, after case,

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:40.857
is that those voluntary codes of conduct

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:43.484
are not worth the paper
that they're written on.

01:12:43.568 --> 01:12:46.863
We need to acknowledge,
particularly in the fashion industry,

01:12:46.946 --> 01:12:50.992
that human capital is part
of this miraculous formula.

01:12:51.743 --> 01:12:55.163
Without human capital,
without cheap labor,

01:12:55.246 --> 01:12:57.207
cheap female labor,

01:12:57.290 --> 01:13:00.752
it would not be generating
the profits that it is.

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:04.589
That needs to be acknowledged,
it needs to be dealt with,

01:13:04.672 --> 01:13:08.343
and those people need to be
rewarded instead of exploited.

01:13:08.426 --> 01:13:10.094
Where is their piece of the pie?

01:13:10.178 --> 01:13:12.388
That's what we constantly
have to ask ourselves.

01:13:12.472 --> 01:13:16.518
Are those buyers immoral?
Or they just don't--? Or are they amoral?

01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:19.729
The system they're working for
and the system that allows companies

01:13:19.812 --> 01:13:21.022
to do this is amoral.

01:13:21.105 --> 01:13:23.858
The individuals concerned
are simply products of that system

01:13:23.942 --> 01:13:26.569
and having to drive it through
to its logical conclusion.

01:13:26.653 --> 01:13:29.989
What we need to do is change the way
those companies operate.

01:13:30.698 --> 01:13:33.409
Operating within a system
that only measures profit,

01:13:33.493 --> 01:13:35.912
companies have little incentive
to do anything

01:13:35.995 --> 01:13:39.123
other than to make this quarter
better than the last.

01:13:39.207 --> 01:13:42.252
No matter what damage
is caused along the way.

01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:45.129
As corporations that make up
the global fashion industry,

01:13:45.213 --> 01:13:47.674
major brands, as well as seed
and chemical companies,

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:51.803
are growing today to reach
unprecedented global size and power.

01:13:51.886 --> 01:13:55.515
This mandate for profit at all cost
is beginning to stand

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:58.852
in direct opposition
to the values that we share.

01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:01.521
Richard Wolff is an economist,

01:14:01.604 --> 01:14:05.024
who after graduating from Harvard,
Stanford and Yale,

01:14:05.108 --> 01:14:09.320
became convinced that the real problem
is within this system itself.

01:14:09.404 --> 01:14:13.324
So, America became a peculiar country.

01:14:13.408 --> 01:14:16.536
You could criticize the education system
to make the schools better.

01:14:16.619 --> 01:14:20.623
You could criticize the transportation
system to make that work better.

01:14:20.707 --> 01:14:23.751
But you couldn't criticize
the economic system.

01:14:23.835 --> 01:14:25.962
That got a free pass.

01:14:26.045 --> 01:14:27.672
You couldn't criticize, just--

01:14:27.755 --> 01:14:30.717
And if you don't criticize something
for 50 years,

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:33.595
it rots, it goes to seed.

01:14:33.678 --> 01:14:35.555
One of the ways a healthy society works

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:39.642
is it subjects its component systems
to criticism,

01:14:39.726 --> 01:14:42.270
so that we can debate it,
and hopefully fix it,

01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:44.272
or improve it or do better.

01:14:44.355 --> 01:14:47.066
Capitalism couldn't be questioned.

01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:48.318
Capitalism is the reason

01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:51.154
the fashion industry looks
as it does today.

01:14:51.237 --> 01:14:54.991
It's the reason why workers
in Bangladesh are paid so little.

01:14:55.074 --> 01:14:57.869
Because if you're operating
in a capitalist system,

01:14:57.952 --> 01:15:00.997
the main thing you have to do
is create profit

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:04.542
and you have to create more profit
than your competitors.

01:15:04.626 --> 01:15:06.628
And this is what drives companies

01:15:06.711 --> 01:15:09.714
to push wages down and down and down.

01:15:09.797 --> 01:15:13.885
But companies don't go--
Like fashion retailers

01:15:13.968 --> 01:15:18.640
don't go to places like Bangladesh,
for any other reason except

01:15:18.723 --> 01:15:21.184
they can get the cheapest labor possible.

01:15:21.267 --> 01:15:23.853
There's no collective rights
in Bangladesh,

01:15:23.937 --> 01:15:25.647
there's no trade union rights,

01:15:25.730 --> 01:15:27.690
there's a very, very low minimum wage,

01:15:27.774 --> 01:15:30.693
there's no, like, maternity benefits,
there's no pensions,

01:15:30.777 --> 01:15:33.363
that is why the fashion industry
is in Bangladesh

01:15:33.446 --> 01:15:36.366
because it can reap the biggest profits
out of those people

01:15:36.449 --> 01:15:38.493
that are making the clothes for them.

01:15:38.576 --> 01:15:41.829
Before you can solve a problem,
you have to admit you got one

01:15:41.913 --> 01:15:44.374
and before we're gonna fix
an economic system

01:15:44.457 --> 01:15:47.418
that's working this way,
and producing such tensions

01:15:47.502 --> 01:15:51.256
and inequalities and strains
on our community,

01:15:51.339 --> 01:15:55.176
we have to face the real scope
of the problem we have

01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:58.054
and that's with the system as a whole.

01:15:58.137 --> 01:15:59.430
And at the very least,

01:15:59.514 --> 01:16:02.141
we have to open up
a national debate about it,

01:16:02.225 --> 01:16:05.728
and at the most, I think
we have to think long and hard

01:16:05.812 --> 01:16:08.314
about alternative systems
that might work better.

01:16:08.398 --> 01:16:11.943
[Hilary] For the environment,
the great threat is that capital

01:16:12.026 --> 01:16:16.322
must continue to expand infinitely
in order to survive.

01:16:16.406 --> 01:16:20.201
It can't have any limits
on its expansion and its growth.

01:16:20.285 --> 01:16:22.871
The natural world
clearly does have limits.

01:16:22.954 --> 01:16:26.541
There are very defined limits
to how much the world can sustain

01:16:26.624 --> 01:16:29.043
in terms of production,
in terms of trade,

01:16:29.127 --> 01:16:31.462
in terms of transport and distribution.

01:16:31.546 --> 01:16:34.090
And it's quite clear
that we've already overstepped

01:16:34.174 --> 01:16:37.260
a lot of those limits, which is why
you're seeing such stress

01:16:37.343 --> 01:16:39.846
in the natural world at the moment.

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:43.391
[Hoskins] The system we live in isn't one
that most people want to live in.

01:16:43.474 --> 01:16:46.519
I think it's a system that makes
most people very unhappy,

01:16:46.603 --> 01:16:49.939
and I don't think people want to live
on a slowly dying planet

01:16:50.023 --> 01:16:52.650
or to be exploiting, um, you know,
their neighbors.

01:16:52.734 --> 01:16:57.030
So, I think we need
huge systemic change.

01:16:57.113 --> 01:16:59.699
[Wolff]
If you don't change the system,

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:02.327
you're leaving intact

01:17:02.410 --> 01:17:05.747
the decision-making of these enterprises,

01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:09.083
which means a small group
of executives and shareholders

01:17:09.167 --> 01:17:11.461
are gonna be working
in the same system,

01:17:11.544 --> 01:17:14.589
subject to the same pattern
of rewards and punishments,

01:17:14.672 --> 01:17:18.218
which will sooner or later
make them reimpose,

01:17:18.301 --> 01:17:19.928
there or elsewhere,

01:17:20.011 --> 01:17:22.180
the very conditions
you're fighting against.

01:17:22.263 --> 01:17:26.142
So, stop this stuff about improving
their conditions,

01:17:26.226 --> 01:17:29.896
deal with the system,
or else you're not serious.

01:17:29.979 --> 01:17:33.399
[Kasser] Our economic system
is one of consumer capitalism,

01:17:33.483 --> 01:17:37.987
and that's why the government needs
to have consumption

01:17:38.071 --> 01:17:40.031
at very high levels, um,

01:17:40.114 --> 01:17:42.075
and why, of course, the corporations do,

01:17:42.158 --> 01:17:45.203
and why at some level
most people then buy into it.

01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:48.831
I can't tell you the number of people
I talked to who say, "Well,

01:17:48.915 --> 01:17:52.877
but if we became less materialistic
our economy would tank."

01:17:52.961 --> 01:17:57.966
Well, they're right in some level,
because our economy is

01:17:58.049 --> 01:18:03.513
based on materialism,
it's based on these kinds of values.

01:18:03.596 --> 01:18:06.224
That's what it needs
in order to survive.

01:18:06.307 --> 01:18:08.768
That's part of the fuel that it needs.

01:18:09.394 --> 01:18:11.938
The problem is that comes
at a really high price.

01:18:12.021 --> 01:18:15.358
â™ª Black Friday's here
Can we go please? â™ª

01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:18.403
â™ª Go, go, go, go, go
Shop, shop, shop, shop â™ª

01:18:18.486 --> 01:18:19.863
Black Friday shopping mania

01:18:19.946 --> 01:18:22.240
still playing out tonight
at malls across America.

01:18:22.323 --> 01:18:24.450
In some places across
this country tonight,

01:18:24.534 --> 01:18:25.910
it's as if someone announced

01:18:25.994 --> 01:18:27.871
we're in danger of running out of stuff,

01:18:27.954 --> 01:18:30.707
and those who need stuff
had better go out and buy it now

01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:32.375
'cause it's going away forever.

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:35.503
[woman] Walmart, doing more
than 10 million transactions

01:18:35.587 --> 01:18:37.714
in the first four hours of the frenzy.

01:18:37.797 --> 01:18:43.094
A record 15,000 people at Macy's
in New York City, shoppers hung tough.

01:18:43.178 --> 01:18:46.764
Black Friday will be the single
largest day of the retail year.

01:18:46.848 --> 01:18:50.393
Certainly in the case of Macy's,
we'll do more business on this day

01:18:50.476 --> 01:18:53.021
than on any other, uh, day of the year.

01:18:53.104 --> 01:18:58.109
Nation, this orgy of Christmas shopping
proves America is back!

01:18:58.193 --> 01:18:59.986
We are once again... Yes!

01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:01.571
[audience cheering]

01:19:01.654 --> 01:19:03.156
Oh, yes!

01:19:03.865 --> 01:19:07.869
We are once again
spending money we don't have

01:19:07.952 --> 01:19:10.830
on things we don't need
to give to people we don't like.

01:19:10.914 --> 01:19:12.916
[audience cheering]

01:19:12.999 --> 01:19:14.000
Yeah.

01:19:14.083 --> 01:19:18.713
[chanting]
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

01:19:19.797 --> 01:19:21.508
[woman screaming]

01:19:24.469 --> 01:19:25.803
[man]
Oh, my God!

01:19:36.564 --> 01:19:38.566
[inaudible dialogue]

01:20:26.114 --> 01:20:28.116
[crowd clamoring]

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:09.324
[speaking in foreign language]

01:21:25.548 --> 01:21:27.425
[speaking in foreign language]

01:21:31.262 --> 01:21:33.139
[Akhter speaking in foreign language]

01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:56.014
[Pepper] I grew up on a farm,
married a guy that grew up on a farm,

01:22:56.097 --> 01:22:59.684
and, uh, those of us living
on the farm live there.

01:22:59.767 --> 01:23:04.230
It needs to be safe for us, too.
The new chemicals that are coming out,

01:23:04.314 --> 01:23:08.902
and the intensity of the use,
was just continuing to increase.

01:23:08.985 --> 01:23:13.323
And, um, then in 2005,

01:23:13.781 --> 01:23:15.158
um...

01:23:15.241 --> 01:23:18.077
Terry started having some loss
of fine motor skills,

01:23:18.161 --> 01:23:20.288
and this and that,
and come to find out

01:23:20.371 --> 01:23:24.083
he had a glioblastoma multiforme,
Stage 4 brain tumor,

01:23:25.126 --> 01:23:28.796
and, uh, at the prime age
of 47 years old.

01:23:29.339 --> 01:23:31.925
And, uh, he died at the age of 50.

01:23:32.008 --> 01:23:34.802
They gave us six months,
we had two-and-a-half years,

01:23:34.886 --> 01:23:38.056
and the brain surgeon
that worked on him--

01:23:38.139 --> 01:23:44.145
Lubbock has got huge cancer clinics
and a medical hub.

01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:47.482
We didn't have to go someplace else
to have a brain tumor surgery.

01:23:47.565 --> 01:23:51.152
We were able to stay right here
because he does so many of them.

01:23:51.236 --> 01:23:55.490
He said that these kinds of tumors
are found in men, aged 45-65,

01:23:55.573 --> 01:24:00.495
that work in the agricultural industry
or the oil field.

01:24:00.578 --> 01:24:03.706
And so while I don't have a smoking gun
and the blood tests that say

01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:08.878
the use of, uh, cotton chemicals,
agricultural chemicals,

01:24:08.962 --> 01:24:11.548
directly led to my husband's death,

01:24:11.631 --> 01:24:14.592
there's just too many linkages
with his father's death.

01:24:14.676 --> 01:24:16.678
Growing up
on a chemically-intensive farm,

01:24:16.761 --> 01:24:19.597
we live in the middle
of 3.6 million acres of cotton

01:24:19.681 --> 01:24:21.391
that use a lot of chemicals.

01:24:21.474 --> 01:24:24.853
And so, at that point in time,

01:24:24.936 --> 01:24:27.647
organic was no longer important to me,

01:24:28.439 --> 01:24:30.024
it was imperative.

01:24:30.108 --> 01:24:32.235
It's imperative
that we change agriculture.

01:24:32.318 --> 01:24:35.864
It's imperative, if we're talking
about the long-term sustainability

01:24:35.947 --> 01:24:38.825
and well-being
of our lives on this planet

01:24:38.908 --> 01:24:40.743
and our children's lives on the planet,

01:24:40.827 --> 01:24:43.580
that we have to change.

01:25:05.685 --> 01:25:08.062
[Minney] This is the beginning
of a turning point

01:25:08.146 --> 01:25:11.065
not just for, you know,
a responsible way of doing fashion,

01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:14.861
but for a new way of doing capitalism,
for a new way of doing economics.

01:25:15.486 --> 01:25:20.450
I'm sure that we will see
a significant change

01:25:20.533 --> 01:25:22.285
over the next ten years.

01:25:22.368 --> 01:25:25.413
Um, whether it's in time or not
is another question.

01:25:27.582 --> 01:25:29.167
[Kasser]
Martin Luther King Jr.,

01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:31.461
at a speech in a Brooklyn church,
he said

01:25:31.544 --> 01:25:35.256
that what America needed was
a revolution of values.

01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:38.426
It needed to stop
treating people like things.

01:25:38.510 --> 01:25:41.513
It needed to stop treating
people in ways

01:25:41.596 --> 01:25:43.348
that were just about profit.

01:25:43.431 --> 01:25:47.560
But instead to treat people
in a real and human way.

01:25:48.228 --> 01:25:51.397
[Wolff] My God,
we can do better than this.

01:25:51.481 --> 01:25:56.653
If what we want is to spread,
as I would argue we do,

01:25:56.736 --> 01:26:00.823
spread industry around the world,
not concentrated in one place.

01:26:00.907 --> 01:26:04.994
Let the benefits be shared globally.

01:26:05.078 --> 01:26:10.667
Then let's do that in an orderly,
reasonable, careful way.

01:26:10.750 --> 01:26:13.878
[Shiva] We need to recognize
that capital is just money.

01:26:13.962 --> 01:26:15.547
Money is a means,

01:26:15.630 --> 01:26:18.508
and people should be accountable
for how it's used.

01:26:18.591 --> 01:26:23.555
We need to celebrate the creative power
of human beings.

01:26:23.638 --> 01:26:27.559
And we need to talk of creative work,
we must stop talking about labor.

01:26:27.642 --> 01:26:32.188
We need to look at the land
as not a commodity,

01:26:32.689 --> 01:26:34.983
to be speculated on and traded,

01:26:35.066 --> 01:26:38.862
but as the very basis of our life,
as Mother Earth.

01:26:38.945 --> 01:26:42.156
[Siegle] You change all consumers
into activists,

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:44.284
all consumers asking ethical questions,

01:26:44.367 --> 01:26:47.704
all consumers asking
quite simple questions about

01:26:47.787 --> 01:26:49.414
where their clothes are from,

01:26:49.497 --> 01:26:53.501
all consumers saying, "I'm sorry,
it's not acceptable for someone to die

01:26:53.585 --> 01:26:55.170
in the course of a working day."

01:26:55.253 --> 01:26:58.631
We can't just roll over and say,
"Yes, have it. Do what you like."

01:26:58.715 --> 01:27:01.134
It's too important,
it's too significant an industry.

01:27:01.217 --> 01:27:05.722
It has too much impact and effect
on millions of people worldwide

01:27:05.805 --> 01:27:07.724
and common resources.

01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:16.065
[narrator] Will we continue
to search for happiness

01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:18.193
in the consumption of things?

01:27:18.985 --> 01:27:22.572
Will we be satisfied with a system
that makes us feel rich,

01:27:22.655 --> 01:27:25.658
while leaving our world
so desperately poor?

01:27:25.742 --> 01:27:27.535
Will we continue to turn a blind eye

01:27:27.619 --> 01:27:30.038
to the lives of those behind our clothes?

01:27:30.121 --> 01:27:33.625
Or will this be a turning point,
a new chapter in our story,

01:27:33.708 --> 01:27:37.045
when together,
we begin to make a real change,

01:27:37.128 --> 01:27:42.133
as we remember that everything we wear
was touched by human hands?

01:27:42.717 --> 01:27:45.678
In the midst of all the challenges
facing us today,

01:27:45.762 --> 01:27:47.889
for all the problems
that feel bigger than us

01:27:47.972 --> 01:27:49.807
and beyond our control,

01:27:49.891 --> 01:27:51.809
maybe we could start here

01:27:51.893 --> 01:27:53.520
with clothing.
