A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:08.208 --> 00:09.916
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL LOVE STORY

00:15.333 --> 00:22.333
THREE MINUTES IN THE PRESENT
AND EIGHT MINUTES IN THE PAST

00:29.208 --> 00:30.041
Hey.

00:30.541 --> 00:31.416
Excuse me.

00:32.750 --> 00:34.083
We're closing.

00:34.166 --> 00:36.000
I'm sorry, Mavi. We'll leave.

00:41.166 --> 00:43.125
Do you know every employee's name?

00:44.375 --> 00:47.208
We've all been coming here
for years after work.

00:47.291 --> 00:48.375
Everyone except you.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.541
You always have something better to do.

00:52.208 --> 00:53.333
Things change.

00:57.666 --> 00:58.708
One for the road.

00:59.916 --> 01:00.875
The road where?

01:01.708 --> 01:02.833
To your place.

01:12.208 --> 01:13.041
Fuck.

01:13.541 --> 01:16.125
When I see you at the hospital
in that uniform…

01:16.666 --> 01:17.500
Shut up.

01:29.375 --> 01:30.208
No.

01:32.958 --> 01:33.875
No.

01:33.958 --> 01:34.916
Lina, what's wrong?

01:35.416 --> 01:37.333
This isn't… This isn't it.

01:37.833 --> 01:38.833
Are you okay?

01:38.916 --> 01:39.916
I have to go, Julio.

01:41.958 --> 01:43.833
-Did I do something wrong?
-No.

01:44.333 --> 01:45.166
You sure?

01:48.041 --> 01:48.875
Fuck.

02:28.541 --> 02:32.166
There's so much I want to tell you

02:35.458 --> 02:36.291
Are you cold?

02:37.666 --> 02:38.750
I'm fine.

02:43.708 --> 02:44.875
Are you having fun?

02:46.208 --> 02:47.041
Yeah.

02:47.583 --> 02:49.333
My feet are soaked, but oh well.

02:51.791 --> 02:52.666
Mine are too.

02:54.125 --> 02:56.250
Some mountaineers we are.

02:56.333 --> 02:58.041
Hey, speak for yourself.

03:04.541 --> 03:05.500
Whoa!

03:06.666 --> 03:07.708
It was worth it.

03:09.958 --> 03:10.791
Yes.

03:12.541 --> 03:13.666
This is amazing.

03:18.916 --> 03:20.333
I'm going to take a picture.

03:31.291 --> 03:33.041
My fingers are freezing.

03:39.708 --> 03:40.958
It came out shitty.

03:42.583 --> 03:43.708
Doesn't do it justice.

03:44.208 --> 03:46.791
In that case,
you'll just have to remember it.

03:58.916 --> 04:02.708
-Look, how about here.
-It's too steep. I'm not sure about this.

04:03.333 --> 04:05.208
-Nico, are you scared?
-No.

04:05.291 --> 04:07.666
-But I'd like to live a few more years.
-Let's see.

04:07.750 --> 04:09.750
Come on. Hold on tight. Hold on.

04:10.541 --> 04:12.375
One, two…

04:14.458 --> 04:15.333
and three!

04:19.041 --> 04:19.875
Now.

04:22.958 --> 04:25.250
It's gaining speed! Hey!

04:26.833 --> 04:28.000
Stop! It won't stop!

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Lina?

04:46.333 --> 04:47.166
Lina?

04:47.791 --> 04:48.666
Are you okay?

04:49.458 --> 04:51.875
-It's like… My head hurts a lot.
-Where?

04:51.958 --> 04:53.250
Like…

04:53.833 --> 04:54.708
Like here!

04:55.291 --> 04:56.125
Damn you!

05:00.458 --> 05:01.291
Nico!

05:02.583 --> 05:03.708
I'll show you.

05:04.375 --> 05:05.208
Hey!

05:05.291 --> 05:07.541
-What? What now, huh?
-That's freezing! Stop!

05:15.541 --> 05:16.500
What?

05:17.333 --> 05:19.708
That's right, pal!

05:19.791 --> 05:20.625
Stop!

05:26.458 --> 05:28.208
-No!
-Now what?

05:28.708 --> 05:31.375
-Want some snow? A snow cocktail?
-I can't! No.

05:31.458 --> 05:32.291
Just a bit?

05:34.083 --> 05:35.250
Nico! Stop!

05:43.166 --> 05:44.458
You're such a traitor.

06:03.916 --> 06:04.875
This is so nice.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.041
I could stay like this forever.

06:14.458 --> 06:15.291
With you.

06:28.458 --> 06:29.333
Should we go?

06:30.708 --> 06:32.041
Come on, wait a second.

06:42.208 --> 06:44.041
I could also stay like this forever.

06:47.416 --> 06:50.166
But I don't have much of a choice.
I can't feel my feet.

06:51.708 --> 06:53.708
You might have to drag me to the cabin.

07:02.041 --> 07:03.083
I hurt my butt.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.958
-But I'm the one who ate all that snow.
-What did you expect?

07:35.416 --> 07:37.500
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.625
Play some music.

07:39.708 --> 07:41.250
Okay, but I'll play yours.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.083
I'm bored of mine.

07:48.708 --> 07:49.625
Ready?

07:50.666 --> 07:51.583
For what?

07:52.375 --> 07:53.250
A game.

07:56.708 --> 07:57.541
All right.

08:02.458 --> 08:03.333
Body parts.

08:04.208 --> 08:05.083
An action.

08:06.458 --> 08:07.291
All right.

08:07.833 --> 08:09.416
-I'll start.
-Okay.

08:10.916 --> 08:12.833
CARESS - KISS - LICK - BITE

08:12.916 --> 08:13.958
Caress

08:15.458 --> 08:16.291
butt.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.083
Go on.

08:22.875 --> 08:23.708
Like this?

08:29.291 --> 08:30.416
Go on, it's your turn.

08:55.375 --> 08:56.750
-Hey.
-What?

08:56.833 --> 08:58.333
It said kiss, not lick.

08:59.375 --> 09:00.500
You're a cheater.

09:01.375 --> 09:02.750
But you liked it, right?

09:09.208 --> 09:10.291
Second chance.

09:20.166 --> 09:22.083
I'm the sexiest guy in the Alps.

09:29.750 --> 09:30.833
Here goes

09:31.708 --> 09:32.791
a piece of my ass.

09:35.583 --> 09:38.541
Can you do it on the other side?
That's where I hurt myself.

09:39.291 --> 09:41.375
-You've got some nerve.
-Yeah.

09:51.166 --> 09:52.833
-Where did this come from?
-Well…

09:52.916 --> 09:55.458
-I'll skip it.
-No. Leave it.

09:55.541 --> 09:59.625
There's so much I want to tell you
There's so much I want

09:59.708 --> 10:00.958
Go on, spin it.

10:01.041 --> 10:02.541
To know about you

10:02.625 --> 10:05.916
We can start little by little

10:06.791 --> 10:10.916
Tell me why you're here

10:11.000 --> 10:14.708
Don't be afraid to tell me the truth

10:15.291 --> 10:18.958
It can't be that bad

10:19.041 --> 10:21.583
I also have secrets to tell you

10:21.666 --> 10:23.291
This is a good game, right?

10:23.375 --> 10:27.333
And you should know
That I don't need them anymore

10:27.833 --> 10:31.833
There are so many roads to walk down

10:33.125 --> 10:38.750
Tell me if you'd like to walk with me

10:41.916 --> 10:46.375
Tell me if you'd like to walk with me

10:49.541 --> 10:54.916
Tell me if you'd like to walk with me

10:57.791 --> 11:03.291
Tell me if you'd like to walk with me

11:08.750 --> 11:12.291
I'm ready to let it all go

11:12.375 --> 11:16.416
From the beginning until today

11:16.500 --> 11:20.541
I have a story within me to give you

11:20.625 --> 11:24.583
A story that doesn't have an ending

11:25.208 --> 11:28.666
We could tell each other anything

11:28.750 --> 11:32.750
Even give each other an eternal "no"

11:32.833 --> 11:36.833
But here were are, sitting face to face

11:36.916 --> 11:41.291
Let's celebrate
That life brought us together

11:41.375 --> 11:45.625
There are so many roads to walk down

11:46.958 --> 11:52.083
Tell me if you'd like to walk with me

11:55.125 --> 12:00.500
Tell me if you'd like to walk with me

12:03.375 --> 12:08.458
Tell me if you'd like to walk with me

12:11.583 --> 12:16.625
Tell me if you'd like to walk with me

12:22.916 --> 12:24.875
THIS SERIES IS A WORK OF FICTION.
