01:31.236 --> 01:32.742
We're under attack.

01:32.743 --> 01:33.915
It must be Shredder.

01:33.916 --> 01:35.590
Come on out, Shred-head !

01:35.591 --> 01:39.376
Chill out, dudes.
It's only me.

01:40.851 --> 01:42.961
"Happy birthday Irma" ?

01:42.962 --> 01:46.479
Well, yeah. I was decorating
rhe place for the party.

01:46.480 --> 01:47.987
Hey, that reminds me.

01:47.988 --> 01:50.499
I forgot to invite someone.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.242
Who's that ?

01:52.243 --> 01:54.855
Like... Irma.

01:54.856 --> 01:57.870
No, Michelangelo, I haven't
forgotten about Irma's party.

01:57.871 --> 01:59.914
We'll both be there.

01:59.915 --> 02:01.690
Ok, but about the menu--

02:01.691 --> 02:05.141
What do you think about pizza 
puffs with pizza dip,

02:05.142 --> 02:07.754
followed by a little pizza pudding ?

02:07.755 --> 02:10.267
Oh, I can't discuss

02:10.268 --> 02:11.842
we're here at the planetarium.

02:11.843 --> 02:15.192
A meteorite just crashed
in the area !

02:15.193 --> 02:17.437
Enough, April.
You're on live in 20 seconds.

02:17.438 --> 02:18.643
That's my cue, fellas.

02:18.644 --> 02:21.289
See you tonight.
Ciao.

02:21.290 --> 02:24.473
3, 2, 1. Roll 'em.

02:24.474 --> 02:25.981
Professor Von Ziflin,

02:25.982 --> 02:29.733
you claim the meteorite that landed 
last night is quite unusual.

02:29.734 --> 02:31.408
Decidedly so, ms. O'Neill.

02:31.409 --> 02:34.524
Its core is composed of an 
extremely rare isotope

02:34.525 --> 02:36.200
known as exaporon.

02:36.201 --> 02:38.578
But why is there only
half a meteorite ?

02:38.579 --> 02:40.790
It split in two on impact.

02:40.791 --> 02:43.302
We're keeping the other half
under top security

02:43.303 --> 02:44.910
in order to examine it further

02:44.911 --> 02:46.317
at my laboratory across town.

02:47.558 --> 02:49.601
What is going on ?

02:49.602 --> 02:53.019
Someone's swiping the meteorite.

02:53.020 --> 02:56.536
Yeah, and that someone is our 
favorite creep... Shredder.

02:56.537 --> 02:58.714
This calls for action.

02:58.715 --> 03:00.691
Stop. Nothing will be gained

03:00.692 --> 03:03.639
by running around like a turtle
with its head cut off.

03:07.460 --> 03:10.608
We've got to get that fixed.

03:10.609 --> 03:13.054
Here is the meteorite, Krang.

03:13.055 --> 03:15.566
Well, it's about time.

03:16.707 --> 03:19.218
Once I harness the energy

03:19.219 --> 03:21.229
of the exaporon isotope,

03:21.230 --> 03:23.206
I'll have the world

03:23.207 --> 03:26.188
in the palm of my hands...

03:26.189 --> 03:28.466
That is if i had hands.

03:31.884 --> 03:35.904
Well, that turned out
to be one fine mess...

03:35.905 --> 03:39.924
Allowing some caped criminal to 
make off with a precious meteorite.

03:39.925 --> 03:42.437
Don't worry, Vernon.
I've arranged a second interview

03:42.438 --> 03:44.447
with professor Von Ziflin.

03:44.448 --> 03:47.396
And just where do you think
you're sneaking off to ?

03:47.397 --> 03:49.908
The coffee shop.
I need something to eat.

03:49.909 --> 03:51.953
This diet is killing me.

03:51.954 --> 03:55.470
Irma, for once,
will you forget about food ?

03:55.471 --> 03:58.050
If only I could.

03:59.727 --> 04:02.674
Irma, I need some help
on this meteorite story.

04:02.675 --> 04:05.622
Dig up everything you can
about isotopes.

04:05.623 --> 04:07.063
I can't stand it any longer !

04:07.064 --> 04:08.604
I must have something to eat !

04:08.605 --> 04:12.390
No. Irma, come back !
You can't go off your diet !

04:12.391 --> 04:14.836
Oh, no ?
Just watch me.

04:17.819 --> 04:21.939
Now to crystallize the exaporon.

04:26.530 --> 04:29.544
Just as I hoped. It worked.

04:29.545 --> 04:33.397
Big deal. So you've crystallized it.
Now what ?

04:33.398 --> 04:37.753
Whoever this exaporon-powered
enlarging ray is aimed at

04:37.754 --> 04:42.577
will grow to six times
his normal size.

04:42.578 --> 04:45.023
Just what the world needs...

04:45.024 --> 04:46.967
A 6-foot tall brain.

04:46.968 --> 04:48.943
Wrong, my dear Shredder.

04:48.944 --> 04:52.930
I plan to use the enlarging ray 
on you.

04:52.931 --> 04:54.672
Me ? Why are you being
so generous ?

04:54.673 --> 04:57.185
I thought you hated me.

04:57.186 --> 04:58.693
I do.

04:58.694 --> 05:02.512
There's always the possibility it
might malfunction,

05:02.513 --> 05:06.197
and who knows what might happen ?

05:06.198 --> 05:08.208
I'll take that chance, Krang.

05:08.209 --> 05:11.558
Just think, I'll be a veritable
tower of power.

05:11.559 --> 05:13.970
We'll do a dry run first,

05:13.971 --> 05:16.416
just to make sure all the bugs 
are out.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.192
Now, don't move.

05:18.193 --> 05:21.375
This must be aimed precisely.

05:22.784 --> 05:25.530
What's going on ?

05:29.316 --> 05:31.526
What's happening to me ?

05:39.669 --> 05:43.019
Get me down from here,
and hurry !

05:43.020 --> 05:46.537
Patience, Shredder, patience.

05:51.932 --> 05:56.085
You vile vortex !
Is this your idea of a joke ?

05:56.086 --> 05:57.593
Stop complaining.

05:57.594 --> 06:01.111
Except for a slight problem
of headroom,

06:01.112 --> 06:03.054
it all went perfectly.

06:03.055 --> 06:06.640
Now to test it above ground.

06:06.641 --> 06:09.655
Just make sure
we're in open area.

06:09.656 --> 06:12.235
Please, April.
Just one little cookie.

06:12.236 --> 06:13.742
Forget it, Irma.

06:13.743 --> 06:16.255
Look.

06:16.256 --> 06:18.835
My favorite flavor of ice cream.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.559
No way, Irma.
You're sticking to your diet,

06:23.560 --> 06:24.832
and that's that.

06:24.833 --> 06:26.038
Irma ?

06:26.039 --> 06:27.545
Where are you ?

06:27.546 --> 06:30.728
I'll bet she's hiding in the alley.

06:30.729 --> 06:34.950
Irma, where are you ?

06:34.951 --> 06:36.458
She's here somewhere.

06:36.459 --> 06:39.306
I can hear her stomach rumbling.

06:39.307 --> 06:41.316
What's that ?

06:49.090 --> 06:50.563
I'm here, Krang.

06:50.564 --> 06:52.339
Send up the exaporon probe.

06:53.479 --> 06:56.292
What's going on here ?

06:58.337 --> 06:59.844
Turtles, come in !

06:59.845 --> 07:02.022
Turtles, come in, please !

07:02.023 --> 07:03.228
Anyone !

07:03.229 --> 07:05.472
What's wrong, April ?
Are you in trouble ?

07:05.473 --> 07:07.516
Oh, boy, am I ever.

07:07.517 --> 07:09.024
Just hang in there, April.

07:09.025 --> 07:10.498
Do I have a choice ?

07:10.499 --> 07:13.212
Turtle power !

07:15.860 --> 07:16.898
What's the delay ?

07:16.899 --> 07:19.142
Activate the enlarging ray.

07:19.143 --> 07:22.895
Something is interfering
with the transmission.

07:22.896 --> 07:27.519
It's that meddlesome 
female reporter.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.629
I'll handle her.

07:31.573 --> 07:32.778
Hi, April.

07:32.779 --> 07:35.157
Why are you hanging around
in the alley ?

07:35.158 --> 07:37.234
Irma ! Quick !
Get help !

07:38.810 --> 07:41.657
I'm afraid it's too late.

07:41.658 --> 07:43.500
That's what you think, tin grin !

07:43.501 --> 07:47.185
Dude, you're about to get
shell shocked.

07:47.186 --> 07:49.464
Oh, hurry with that enlarging ray.

07:49.465 --> 07:52.479
I'm moving it into position now.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.825
What's happening ?

07:56.735 --> 07:58.409
Oh, no !

07:58.410 --> 08:00.855
That weird ray's has hit Irma !

08:10.304 --> 08:12.213
We've got to get her out of there !

08:16.067 --> 08:17.239
It's no use.

08:17.240 --> 08:19.919
We can't get past the electrical
barrier.

08:22.366 --> 08:24.777
Irma, are you ok ?

08:24.778 --> 08:28.563
No. That thing melted my ice cream.

08:28.564 --> 08:30.238
Shredder is getting away !

08:32.618 --> 08:34.494
Sayonara, turtles,

08:34.495 --> 08:36.671
for now.

08:39.453 --> 08:41.025
Bummer.

08:41.027 --> 08:43.037
We lost him.

08:43.038 --> 08:45.047
What now, fearless leader ?

08:45.048 --> 08:46.555
We follow him.

08:46.556 --> 08:49.168
Hold it. What's that noise ?

08:49.169 --> 08:50.676
Get back !

08:50.677 --> 08:52.820
It's volcanic lava !

08:52.821 --> 08:55.333
I wonder what that was all about ?

08:55.334 --> 08:57.779
You look a little strange, Irma.

08:57.780 --> 08:59.554
Are you sure you're ok ?

08:59.555 --> 09:02.905
I've never felt better or hungrier.

09:02.906 --> 09:05.417
I'll be in my office.

09:05.418 --> 09:08.701
Well, Irma, have you dug up 
those meteorite reports yet ?

09:08.702 --> 09:11.516
I was just about to do it, Vernon.

09:11.517 --> 09:13.057
Good.
I'll go with you.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.149
I think it's in that cabinet.

09:19.826 --> 09:21.667
Sorry.

09:21.668 --> 09:23.174
You klutz ! 

09:23.175 --> 09:26.357
You and your big feet.

09:26.358 --> 09:29.373
I'll have you know
my feet are not big.

09:30.882 --> 09:34.902
On second thought, they do look
a little bigger.

09:34.903 --> 09:37.749
I'll need that file box.

09:37.750 --> 09:39.256
Get the ladder, will you ?

09:39.257 --> 09:40.429
You won't need it.

09:40.430 --> 09:42.272
I think i can reach
It with my..

09:42.273 --> 09:45.020
My arms ?

09:45.021 --> 09:46.963
Irma, you klutz.

09:46.964 --> 09:49.475
Sorry, vernon.

09:49.476 --> 09:51.151
Something
Startled me.

09:51.152 --> 09:54.099
Find those files
And bring them
To my desk !

09:54.100 --> 09:55.607
Good heavens.

09:55.608 --> 09:58.689
What's happening
To me ?

09:58.690 --> 10:01.705
What's in the test
Tube, donatello ?

10:01.706 --> 10:04.552
Some crystals i found
Where we encountered shredder.

10:04.553 --> 10:06.562
Just as i suspected--

10:06.563 --> 10:09.512
Crystalized
Exaporon.

10:09.513 --> 10:11.522
What
Does it mean ?

10:11.523 --> 10:12.861
That irma could
Be in big trouble,

10:12.862 --> 10:15.174
And i do mean <I>big !

10:19.731 --> 10:21.807
Irma: this can't
Be happening to me !

10:21.808 --> 10:24.253
Irma, are you
All right ?

10:24.254 --> 10:25.995
Irma: this can't
Be happening to me !

10:28.241 --> 10:30.518
Come in, turtles !
I need you !

10:31.859 --> 10:34.806
Did you say
A 10-foot hole
In the wall ?

10:34.807 --> 10:37.554
Yes. Something awful's
Happened to irma.

10:37.555 --> 10:40.569
She must have been
Kidnapped by a monster.

10:40.570 --> 10:42.579
Uh, i hate
To tell you this, april,

10:42.580 --> 10:45.595
But i'm afraid the monster
Just might be irma.

10:45.596 --> 10:47.605
Krang: as usual,

10:47.606 --> 10:50.520
You botched
A perfect plan.

10:50.521 --> 10:52.364
Me ? You were the one

10:52.365 --> 10:55.044
Who aimed
The enlarging ray
At the wrong person !

10:55.045 --> 10:59.064
We need more
Exaporon to repair
The apparatus.

10:59.065 --> 11:03.252
Find the rest of that
Meteorite wherever
It's hidden.

11:03.253 --> 11:04.425
It won't be easy

11:04.426 --> 11:06.602
Now that the turtles
Are on to me.

11:06.603 --> 11:10.120
The turtles will have
Their flippers full

11:10.121 --> 11:14.509
Trying to keep
That woman from
Destroying the city.

11:14.510 --> 11:16.017
Observe.

11:16.018 --> 11:18.362
Oh, what a day.

11:18.363 --> 11:20.876
First,
I chip a nail.

11:20.877 --> 11:22.383
And now this.

11:25.399 --> 11:26.906
Oh, excuse me.

11:26.907 --> 11:28.950
I didn't mean to do that.

11:28.951 --> 11:30.759
Wow, dudes.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.266
Check out irma.

11:32.267 --> 11:36.387
She's turned into
A 30-foot-tall giant klutz.

11:36.388 --> 11:38.197
There goes
The neighborhood.

11:43.291 --> 11:44.797
Sorry.

11:44.798 --> 11:46.874
It was an accident.

11:49.522 --> 11:52.168
Oh, this is
So embarrassing.

11:52.169 --> 11:53.374
Get me out !

11:57.027 --> 11:59.070
I've got to get back
To channel 6.

11:59.071 --> 12:01.683
Maybe april
Can help me.

12:07.380 --> 12:08.887
Uh, splendid.

12:08.888 --> 12:10.897
She frightened everyone
Out of the building.

12:10.898 --> 12:15.051
We'll have no trouble breaking
Into von ziflin's laboratory.

12:15.052 --> 12:16.559
This exaporon sensor

12:16.560 --> 12:20.244
Will lead us
To the meteorite.

12:20.245 --> 12:22.289
Rock steady,
Use a blaster grenade.

12:22.290 --> 12:24.600
Sure thing, boss.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.463
Something's wrong.

12:30.464 --> 12:32.977
This signal
Is growing weaker.

12:32.978 --> 12:34.987
Blast it !
The exaporon isn't here.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.331
It must be hidden
Someplace else.

12:37.332 --> 12:39.074
But where ?

12:41.185 --> 12:43.698
This is a channel 6
Emergency report

12:43.699 --> 12:45.172
On the giant woman.

12:45.173 --> 12:47.550
We advise all viewers
To remain calm,

12:47.551 --> 12:48.723
Stay off the streets--

12:48.724 --> 12:49.761
What ?

12:49.762 --> 12:51.571
And above all,
Don't panic !

12:51.572 --> 12:53.581
Look, there she is !

12:53.582 --> 12:55.122
We'll help you, irma !

12:55.123 --> 12:57.100
Just try not to move.

12:57.101 --> 12:58.574
The turtles.

13:03.365 --> 13:05.207
Leonardo, look out.

13:05.208 --> 13:07.485
We're headed right
For those cables.

13:07.486 --> 13:09.964
I can't stop !

13:16.667 --> 13:18.844
Leonardo, stop.

13:18.845 --> 13:21.859
Or we'll be
Four toasted turtles !

13:21.860 --> 13:23.366
I can't !

13:23.367 --> 13:25.544
The brakes
Are out !

13:25.545 --> 13:28.492
I sometimes wonder
What you guys
Would do without me.

13:33.486 --> 13:36.098
Mondo move,
Donatello !

13:36.099 --> 13:38.846
It's all
In the wrist.

13:40.958 --> 13:43.201
I'll handle these.

13:44.643 --> 13:46.417
But it's not over yet.

13:46.418 --> 13:48.863
We still have to fix
That transmitter.

13:48.864 --> 13:50.169
Will this help ?

13:54.559 --> 13:58.479
Boy, is this a great way
To travel or what ?

14:01.361 --> 14:03.303
There's
The nasty culprit.

14:03.304 --> 14:05.314
Hey, not to worry, dudes.

14:05.315 --> 14:07.692
This one's on me.

14:09.670 --> 14:11.177
Thank you, turtles.

14:11.178 --> 14:14.695
I feel like such
An overgrown klutz.

14:14.696 --> 14:18.716
Now, irma,
It's not that bad.

14:18.717 --> 14:20.223
Yes, it is.

14:20.224 --> 14:23.339
I'll never
Be normal again.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.115
Aw, lighten up, irma.

14:25.116 --> 14:26.790
It's no biggie.

14:26.791 --> 14:29.135
No biggie ?

14:31.415 --> 14:32.753
Nice work,
Michelangelo.

14:32.754 --> 14:35.400
You and your
Big mouth.

14:35.401 --> 14:37.109
Big mouth !

14:40.193 --> 14:41.699
Cut it out.

14:41.700 --> 14:44.714
I just had
My shell turtlewaxed.

14:44.715 --> 14:48.400
And i used to think
It would be fun
To be tall !

14:48.401 --> 14:50.075
No, irma, don't !

14:54.432 --> 14:56.944
I did it again.

14:56.945 --> 14:59.557
Well, at least things
Can't get any worse.

14:59.558 --> 15:02.137
They just did.
Listen to this.

15:02.138 --> 15:04.047
And the military
Has been called out

15:04.048 --> 15:06.057
To take charge
Of this emergency.

15:06.058 --> 15:08.067
Their assignment--
To sedate and capture

15:08.068 --> 15:11.283
This dangerous,
Overgrown menace.

15:11.284 --> 15:12.792
Did you hear
That ?

15:12.793 --> 15:15.639
The entire army
Is after irma.

15:15.640 --> 15:18.152
Hey, like, maybe if
She just scrunches down,

15:18.153 --> 15:20.229
They won't notice her,
Huh ?

15:20.230 --> 15:22.004
We're gonna
Have to hide her out,

15:22.005 --> 15:24.350
And i know just the place.

15:24.351 --> 15:26.360
This is really
Out in the boonies.

15:26.361 --> 15:28.739
I hope they gave me
The right directions.

15:28.740 --> 15:30.415
Oh, there's
The airport,

15:30.416 --> 15:32.659
But where
Are the turtles ?

15:35.407 --> 15:36.915
Irma ?

15:38.926 --> 15:40.733
Some people
Look a lot taller

15:40.734 --> 15:42.409
When they're
Lying down.

15:42.410 --> 15:44.419
I wish i'd brought
More videotape.

15:44.420 --> 15:46.831
I'll run out before
I get to her knees.

15:46.832 --> 15:48.373
Red alert, gang.

15:48.374 --> 15:53.197
She's about to crank out
A whole bunch of "zs."

15:53.198 --> 15:54.705
Look out !

15:54.706 --> 15:56.045
Run !

16:02.245 --> 16:04.756
Sounds like
The all clear.

16:04.757 --> 16:09.313
That was a definite 6.5
On the ricotta scale.

16:09.314 --> 16:12.228
Well, donatello,
Making any progress ?

16:12.229 --> 16:13.736
I'm hoping the exaporon

16:13.737 --> 16:16.248
Will reverse the effects
Of the enlarging ray.

16:16.249 --> 16:18.661
But i'll need
A larger sample.

16:18.662 --> 16:20.101
No problem.

16:20.102 --> 16:21.609
Professor von ziflin
Told me

16:21.610 --> 16:23.619
That the other half
Of the meteorite

16:23.620 --> 16:26.199
Is in
The planetarium vault.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.707
Did you hear that,
Fellas ?

16:27.708 --> 16:29.650
Let's make
Turtle tracks !

16:29.651 --> 16:33.034
Shredder, where are you ?

16:33.035 --> 16:34.642
Krang, this exaporon
Sensor of yours

16:34.643 --> 16:36.987
Is a piece of junk.

16:36.988 --> 16:39.902
We searched all over
And came up empty-handed.

16:39.903 --> 16:42.616
And also
Empty-headed.

16:42.617 --> 16:47.173
Do you realize where
Those turtles are
At this very instant ?

16:47.174 --> 16:50.121
They're headed
For the planetarium.

16:52.869 --> 16:54.376
You there !

16:56.555 --> 16:58.564
I sure hope
This works.

16:58.565 --> 17:01.245
Hold it
Right there, sir.

17:01.246 --> 17:02.350
Von ziflin:
Who are you ?

17:02.351 --> 17:03.355
Military business.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.963
Exactamundo !

17:04.964 --> 17:08.446
We've come for
That meteorite, dude.

17:08.448 --> 17:11.127
It's needed
For operation irma.

17:11.128 --> 17:12.200
Oh, by all means.

17:12.201 --> 17:13.708
Follow me.

17:13.709 --> 17:14.914
Move it, professor.

17:14.915 --> 17:18.332
We military people work
On a strict time schedule.

17:18.333 --> 17:19.604
<I>ja, i'm hurrying
As fast as i can.

17:19.605 --> 17:22.519
There you have it,
The other half
Of the meteorite.

17:22.520 --> 17:24.429
Come to papa.

17:25.435 --> 17:26.741
What's going on ?

17:28.349 --> 17:30.996
Hurry, you cretins !
We don't have
All night !

17:30.997 --> 17:32.504
You ready,
Bebop ?

17:32.505 --> 17:35.184
On the count
Of five.

17:35.185 --> 17:37.630
Oh, never mind.
I'll do it myself.

17:39.173 --> 17:40.679
Surprise !

17:40.680 --> 17:42.388
It's shredder !

17:42.389 --> 17:43.895
What is going on here ?

17:43.896 --> 17:45.704
Army maneuvers,
Professor.

17:45.705 --> 17:47.446
Top secret stuff.

17:47.447 --> 17:49.256
We're about
To engage the enemy,

17:49.257 --> 17:50.931
And it could get messy.

17:50.932 --> 17:52.036
I'd better leave.

17:52.037 --> 17:54.382
I'm a scientist,
Not a jungle fighter.

17:54.383 --> 17:56.392
Let's do it,
Turtles !

17:56.393 --> 17:57.598
What do you know ?

17:57.599 --> 18:01.082
Just like friday night
At the bowling alley.

18:01.083 --> 18:03.361
Heads up, dudes !

18:03.362 --> 18:04.433
Quickly !

18:04.434 --> 18:05.941
Grab the meteorite.

18:05.942 --> 18:07.616
Right, boss.

18:07.617 --> 18:11.301
Cowabunga !

18:11.302 --> 18:12.843
Yo, geeks !

18:12.844 --> 18:15.356
Try this hula hoop on
For size !

18:15.357 --> 18:16.896
Ah, what the...

18:16.897 --> 18:18.505
Gotcha !

18:21.153 --> 18:22.660
Donatello:
They're getting away !

18:22.661 --> 18:24.837
Raphael:
That's what
They think.

18:24.838 --> 18:26.714
Hold it.
The turtle-com.

18:26.715 --> 18:29.561
April: guys, we're
In big trouble.

18:29.562 --> 18:31.504
And i do mean big !

18:31.505 --> 18:32.945
Irma just woke up,

18:32.946 --> 18:34.587
And she's headed
For the city

18:34.588 --> 18:38.374
With a huge case
Of the munchies.

18:38.375 --> 18:40.116
Leonardo: i don't see
Any sign of her.

18:40.117 --> 18:42.628
Raphael: well,
She shouldn't be
Too hard to see.

18:42.629 --> 18:44.035
Check it out !

18:44.036 --> 18:45.476
There she is !

18:45.477 --> 18:47.486
Food.

18:47.487 --> 18:49.228
I must have food.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.674
Leonardo:
She's growing taller
By the minute.

18:51.675 --> 18:53.852
That's why
She's so hungry.

18:53.853 --> 18:55.963
If i can get her
To swallow

18:55.964 --> 18:58.375
This large, economy-size
Exaporon capsule,

18:58.376 --> 19:00.788
It might reverse
The growth process.

19:00.789 --> 19:02.462
Lots of luck.

19:02.463 --> 19:09.097
We got to beat out
The entire army first.

19:09.098 --> 19:10.135
Turtles ?

19:10.136 --> 19:11.643
Yeah, you remember.

19:11.644 --> 19:14.356
The good guys
Who always wear green.

19:14.357 --> 19:15.998
Oh, right.

19:15.999 --> 19:17.908
April's friends.

19:17.909 --> 19:20.923
I mixed up an antidote
That might work.

19:20.924 --> 19:22.866
What do i do
With this ?

19:22.867 --> 19:24.876
Swallow it !

19:24.877 --> 19:27.892
Yeah ! Then like call us
In the morning.

19:27.893 --> 19:29.568
Forget it.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.377
I can't
Swallow pills.

19:31.378 --> 19:33.253
When i
Was little,

19:33.254 --> 19:35.130
My mother gave me
My medicine

19:35.131 --> 19:38.145
In a spoonful
Of ice cream.

19:38.146 --> 19:40.524
Oh, but, irma,
You're a big girl now.

19:40.525 --> 19:42.534
Real big.

19:42.535 --> 19:45.013
And we've got
Big problems.

19:45.014 --> 19:46.454
Vernon:
What a scoop !

19:46.455 --> 19:47.525
April will be
So jealous

19:47.526 --> 19:51.044
When she finds out
I beat her to this story.

19:51.045 --> 19:52.485
I love that idea !

19:53.491 --> 19:54.763
Leonardo:
What the heck
Is that ?

19:54.764 --> 19:58.784
Irma's story gave me
A totally awesome idea.

19:58.785 --> 20:01.128
Help me lift
This thing, dudes.

20:01.129 --> 20:04.546
Ok, donatello,
Pop in that pill.

20:04.547 --> 20:06.858
Now, let's get shakin' !

20:08.433 --> 20:10.979
This is the moment
I've been waiting for !

20:10.980 --> 20:12.352
Call the station
And tell them

20:12.353 --> 20:14.866
To put me on live feed
In 30 seconds.

20:18.216 --> 20:19.891
Now what ?

20:19.892 --> 20:22.136
Michelangelo:
You scarf it down !

20:22.137 --> 20:23.644
What else ?

20:23.645 --> 20:26.089
Ok. If you say so.

20:27.832 --> 20:31.182
I've always dreamed
Of doing this.

20:33.193 --> 20:34.633
What's happening ?

20:34.634 --> 20:36.408
I--i'm shrinking !

20:36.409 --> 20:38.418
Way to go, donatello !

20:39.424 --> 20:40.429
Fantastic !

20:40.430 --> 20:41.836
Vernon fenwick here

20:41.837 --> 20:44.650
With a channel 6
Exclusive eyewitness
Report on the capture

20:44.651 --> 20:46.627
Of that
Mountain-size menace...

20:46.628 --> 20:47.632
Irma ?

20:47.633 --> 20:49.642
Sorry, Vernon, you're too late.

20:49.643 --> 20:52.591
There's no more ice cream left.

20:55.574 --> 20:57.181
Great, Donatello !

20:57.182 --> 20:59.024
What do you call that dance ?

20:59.025 --> 21:00.363
The turtle trot.

21:00.364 --> 21:01.436
Trust me.

21:01.437 --> 21:04.117
This is one move
I did not teach them.

21:04.118 --> 21:07.902
Hey, dudes, it's scarfin' time !

21:07.903 --> 21:11.755
We got 31 flavors of ice cream pizza,

21:11.756 --> 21:13.665
everything from vanilla meatballs

21:13.666 --> 21:17.954
to my personal favorite,
anchovy butterscotch !

21:17.955 --> 21:21.639
Do you have any chocolate fudge
with extra garlic ?

21:21.640 --> 21:23.649
Oh, for sure, little lady.

21:23.650 --> 21:26.464
One for each delicate hand.

21:26.465 --> 21:28.675
"Little lady."

21:28.676 --> 21:32.025
I never thought I'd hear that again.

21:32.026 --> 21:35.041
You never will, if you keep on
eating like that.

21:35.042 --> 21:36.716
What about your diet ?

21:37.957 --> 21:39.229
I am through with diets, April.

21:39.230 --> 21:44.322
After all, I just lost 10,000 pounds.
