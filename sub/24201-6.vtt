01:16.833 --> 01:20.333
I'm afraid I have some bad news
that you will not like to hear,

01:20.416 --> 01:24.208
which is that some people in this world
enjoy hearing bad news.

01:24.291 --> 01:26.833
I heard Count Olaf was murdered
in his jail cell last night.

01:26.916 --> 01:29.708
That's bad news.
I was excited to burn him at the stake.

01:29.791 --> 01:33.625
What is bad news to one person might be
good news to someone else.

01:33.708 --> 01:36.583
And sometimes,
what seems like good news...

01:36.666 --> 01:37.958
Olaf's been murdered?

01:38.041 --> 01:41.500
Olaf hasn't been murdered at all.
That's Jacques Snicket.

01:41.583 --> 01:46.125
...might actually be something
full of sadness, misery and grief.

01:46.208 --> 01:48.000
My name is Lemony Snicket.

01:49.041 --> 01:51.291
The story of the Baudelaire orphans
haunts me

01:51.375 --> 01:54.875
the way my brother's death haunts me
in a small, dusty town.

01:54.958 --> 01:57.625
It fills me with sadness,
misery and grief.

01:57.708 --> 02:00.083
But you have no reason
to be as haunted as I am.

02:00.166 --> 02:02.833
Look away.
This is nothing you ought to see.

02:03.750 --> 02:06.250
Let's go, children.
This is nothing you ought to see.

02:06.333 --> 02:07.791
Not so fast, daddy-o.

02:07.875 --> 02:11.291
It's not cool to dismiss
suspects at the scene of a crime.

02:11.375 --> 02:14.000
Suspects? If anyone did this, it was you.

02:14.083 --> 02:18.791
It's extra just not cool
to disagree with Detective Dupin.

02:18.875 --> 02:20.500
Your name isn't Dupin, it's...

02:20.583 --> 02:22.166
Silence in the crowd! Gather round!

02:22.250 --> 02:26.791
The Council of Elders has called
this emergency town meeting.

02:26.875 --> 02:29.083
There have been
a lot of emergency meetings lately.

02:29.166 --> 02:30.958
I'm fallin' behind on my stories.

02:31.041 --> 02:34.583
It's imperative that we discuss
this most mysterious murder.

02:34.666 --> 02:38.625
I don't think it's imperative.
I think it is absolutely necessary.

02:38.708 --> 02:41.583
"Imperative" means
"absolutely necessary," Esmé.

02:41.666 --> 02:45.625
My name is not Esmé.
It's Sarah Petunia Alexandra Maryellen.

02:45.708 --> 02:49.708
- Is that what she said yesterday?
- But you call me Officer Luciana.

02:49.791 --> 02:52.916
It's my duty to lock up prisoners
in the Uptown Jail,

02:53.000 --> 02:55.916
and I make sure Jacques was safe
in his cell last night.

02:56.000 --> 02:56.916
Who's Jacques?

02:59.208 --> 03:01.500
It's my nickname
for Count Olaf.

03:01.583 --> 03:02.541
Oh.

03:03.208 --> 03:07.708
I have the only key to the jail,
so his death is a mystery.

03:07.791 --> 03:10.291
I do love a mystery.

03:10.375 --> 03:12.833
Especially when it takes place
in a cozy village

03:12.916 --> 03:14.875
and stars a detective with a funny voice.

03:14.958 --> 03:16.875
You're  right, moldy oldies.

03:16.958 --> 03:20.791
But lucky for you cats,
I'm a peachy detective with a face for TV

03:20.875 --> 03:22.750
and I've already cracked
this Popsicle case.

03:22.833 --> 03:25.166
Mmm! This is so exciting!

03:25.250 --> 03:27.625
It's horrible. An innocent person is dead.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.083
I'm as shocked as you are.

03:29.166 --> 03:31.208
But you know
that Count Omar was far from innocent.

03:31.291 --> 03:32.250
Count Olaf.

03:32.333 --> 03:34.250
Yes, see? Even the name gives the shivers.

03:34.333 --> 03:37.250
That bushy eyebrow
and tattoo of that eye on his ankle.

03:37.333 --> 03:39.583
Not an eye. It was the letters V-F-D.

03:39.666 --> 03:40.708
That doesn't make sense.

03:40.791 --> 03:44.083
Why would Count Olaf have
the name of this town on his ankle?

03:44.166 --> 03:46.333
We don't know. But we do know
that man's the real Olaf.

03:47.333 --> 03:49.250
And that police officer is Esmé Squalor.

03:50.833 --> 03:54.625
They kidnapped the Quagmires
and now they murdered Jacques Snicket.

03:55.791 --> 04:00.666
These kittens have flipped.
I am a groovy man of the law, man.

04:00.750 --> 04:03.083
I wouldn't harm the hair on a shoofly.

04:03.166 --> 04:04.833
But reconnoiter this, villagers.

04:04.916 --> 04:07.791
The Baudelaires are pointing
their bony little fingers at me

04:07.875 --> 04:11.541
because they are, in fact, 100%...

04:12.250 --> 04:13.916
the murderers.

04:15.208 --> 04:17.666
These Baudelaires can't be the murderers.
They're children.

04:17.750 --> 04:24.250
Detective, you must have evidence for
this startling and handsome accusation.

04:24.333 --> 04:26.125
Correcto, lady cop.

04:26.208 --> 04:30.333
It's just not cool to accuse people
of murder without having evidence.

04:30.416 --> 04:34.041
Lucky for you, I'm a great detective
and I found some.

04:37.625 --> 04:40.083
Orphans are dragsville, man.

04:40.166 --> 04:43.625
They come into your village,
sneak into your jail.

04:43.708 --> 04:48.791
They kill and they pillage.
With the help of these!

04:48.875 --> 04:53.416
Blue bird. Blue sky.
Blueberry pie. Uh-uh.

04:53.500 --> 04:56.000
Blueprints! Yeah, man.

04:56.083 --> 05:00.083
That's what the Baudelaires used
to find a weak space in the wall,

05:00.166 --> 05:01.708
so they could use...

05:02.916 --> 05:04.041
Uh, what is that thing?

05:04.125 --> 05:06.291
I think
it's some kind of mechanical device.

05:08.041 --> 05:11.333
Oh, yeah. A device of mechanics so mean,

05:11.416 --> 05:14.916
the Baudelaires used that  thing.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.666
They punched a hole
in the wall of the jail.

05:18.750 --> 05:21.166
Crept in on bad cat paws.

05:21.250 --> 05:27.625
And snuffed out the light
of Count Olaf, um, in the night.

05:31.541 --> 05:34.541
Orphans.

05:38.958 --> 05:41.083
- That's very shocking.
- He's wrong.

05:41.166 --> 05:44.208
So these blueprints
and mechanical device are not yours?

05:44.291 --> 05:45.875
They are. But we're not murderers!

05:45.958 --> 05:48.708
The spunky sister is right.
These two aren't murderers.

05:48.791 --> 05:50.541
They're accomplices.

05:50.625 --> 05:53.583
- That means "helper of murderers."
- We know what "accomplice" means!

05:53.666 --> 05:55.583
What are you talking about?

05:55.666 --> 05:58.708
Detective, talk to them
about what you're talking about.

05:58.791 --> 06:01.916
I'm talking about tooth marks
on Count Olaf's body.

06:02.541 --> 06:06.500
There's only one person so uncool
as to bite someone to death.

06:06.583 --> 06:09.416
The murderer who murdered Count Olaf
by murder

06:09.500 --> 06:12.791
is none urder than Sunny Baudelaire!

06:16.125 --> 06:18.833
That can't be right. I'll admit
she has unusually sharp teeth, but...

06:18.916 --> 06:20.416
That's what I'm saying. She's a killer.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.708
A killer baby with deadly teeth.
Dig those choppers, man.

06:24.333 --> 06:28.000
Our sister didn't bite anyone to death.
Detective Dupin is lying.

06:28.083 --> 06:31.375
Instead of dropping accusations
on cool detectives,

06:31.458 --> 06:35.291
maybe you orphans should tend
to your own accusational woes?

06:35.375 --> 06:38.333
Sì. Sì. They should
give everyone an alpaca.

06:38.416 --> 06:40.541
Yes! Wait. What?

06:40.625 --> 06:43.125
- Alibi?
- Yes! Alibi!

06:43.208 --> 06:46.458
Baudelaires, where were you last night
between the hours of dusk and dawn?

06:47.625 --> 06:49.625
We were at Hector's house.

06:49.708 --> 06:52.416
- He'll tell you.
- Tell them you were with us.

06:52.500 --> 06:55.875
Well... Well, I... See, I...

06:55.958 --> 06:58.875
- Hector, please.
- Hector, we're waiting.

06:58.958 --> 07:01.875
No, no. Not again.

07:01.958 --> 07:02.791
Oh, no.

07:03.416 --> 07:05.166
Hector. Hector.

07:07.458 --> 07:11.041
It's true! The children were with me.
They're not murderers.

07:11.125 --> 07:13.416
Where did these items come from, Hector?

07:13.500 --> 07:16.083
Did you provide these children
with illegal materials,

07:16.166 --> 07:17.875
in violation of VFD rules?

07:17.958 --> 07:19.250
Hector didn't do anything.

07:19.333 --> 07:22.291
Trying to pull an innocent cat
into your bad vibes?

07:22.375 --> 07:24.500
That's low, man, real low.

07:24.583 --> 07:26.625
We've heard enough. The evidence is clear.

07:26.708 --> 07:28.625
We've adopted murderers.

07:28.708 --> 07:32.833
VFD can no longer serve as guardians
for such terrible orphans.

07:32.916 --> 07:36.250
So, trial over.
I say we burn them at the stake!

07:36.333 --> 07:38.958
We're talking about children.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.458
I won't wait a minute.
We're talking about murderers.

07:41.541 --> 07:43.416
I say we burn them right now!

07:44.666 --> 07:46.208
Hold on a moment.

07:46.291 --> 07:49.500
We can't simply burn people
at the stake whenever we want.

07:49.583 --> 07:50.958
We're civilized people.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.208
- How about after supper?
- Okay.

07:57.541 --> 08:00.625
I'll keep these bloodthirsties on ice
at the Uptown Jail.

08:00.708 --> 08:01.916
We're not going with you.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.500
Resisting arrest? Chiefie!

08:07.708 --> 08:09.833
We can do this the quiet way.

08:10.750 --> 08:13.708
Or it can get very noisy.

08:15.083 --> 08:16.833
See you at the burning.

08:24.791 --> 08:28.750
Yes. Yes. Yes.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.125
Do you smell smoke?

08:31.208 --> 08:32.707
There's hickory in the dumplings.

08:32.791 --> 08:35.750
- Not literally. Figuratively.
- I always smell smoke figuratively.

08:35.832 --> 08:38.000
- I heard from Mr. Poe.
- Sorry, but you work for him.

08:38.082 --> 08:40.041
He has to stay in town
later than anticipated.

08:40.125 --> 08:42.291
- Something's wrong.
- There's nothing in the paper.

08:46.208 --> 08:48.375
- Olaf's dead?
- Our troubles are over.

08:50.833 --> 08:52.291
Count Olaf isn't dead.

08:53.958 --> 08:55.125
Jacques Snicket is.

08:55.208 --> 08:56.541
Our troubles have just begun.

08:57.958 --> 08:59.833
- I'll get the motorcycle.
- I'll get the sidecar.

09:02.083 --> 09:05.458
Oh, Baudelaires, I'm so sorry.
I should have seen this coming.

09:05.541 --> 09:09.125
Children with your troubled background
often wind up in jail. I...

09:09.208 --> 09:10.166
I blame myself.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.416
Mr. Poe, we're innocent.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.916
They're going to burn us
for a murder Olaf committed.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.250
Oh, listen to yourselves.

09:15.333 --> 09:18.083
You blame positively everything
on this Olaf,

09:18.166 --> 09:21.291
and now you claim
he's responsible for his own murder?

09:21.375 --> 09:23.875
I find that somewhat difficult to swallow.

09:23.958 --> 09:25.958
Can't you use our parents' fortune
to bail us out?

09:26.041 --> 09:28.000
- Or hire a lawyer?
- Oh, no, no.

09:28.083 --> 09:30.666
The Baudelaire fortune is off-limits
till Violet comes of age,

09:30.750 --> 09:32.833
which seems unlikely now.

09:32.916 --> 09:35.000
It certainly can't be used
for criminal matters.

09:35.083 --> 09:37.625
No, no, no.
Take responsibility for your own actions.

09:37.708 --> 09:40.541
- Especially you, Sunny.
- You're not gonna help us?

09:40.625 --> 09:44.875
- Why are you here?
- Oh, I'm here to say goodbye.

09:50.083 --> 09:50.916
Goodbye.

10:08.833 --> 10:11.208
I appreciate you allowing me
a moment with my clients.

10:11.291 --> 10:12.541
It's simply dreadful.

10:12.625 --> 10:14.875
Olaf was terrible.
It's hard to believe he's dead.

10:14.958 --> 10:16.625
Believe it, Daddy Poe.

10:16.708 --> 10:20.541
He's cold as a snowman eating
a bowl full of ice cubes in an igloo.

10:20.625 --> 10:21.958
There you are, darling.

10:22.041 --> 10:23.333
I mean, Police Chief.

10:23.416 --> 10:25.333
You're the police chief.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.583
- Deputy?
- Detective.

10:27.666 --> 10:32.291
Sure, that works. Anyway,
I found this reporter loitering outside.

10:32.375 --> 10:34.625
She wants to do an interview. Come.

10:34.708 --> 10:37.875
Eleanora Poe, editor in chief
for the Daily Punctilio.

10:37.958 --> 10:39.208
Darling.

10:39.291 --> 10:40.875
- Arthur?
- Eleanora.

10:40.958 --> 10:42.791
What are you doing here, love of my life?

10:42.875 --> 10:44.541
I'm here on business, fire of my loins.

10:44.625 --> 10:46.666
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here on business.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.291
We could have carpooled.

10:48.375 --> 10:51.416
- It's a tragically long drive.
- And a tragic occasion.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.333
It's the story of the century.

10:53.416 --> 10:56.166
"Baudelaire Orphans
Now Baudelaire Murderers."

10:56.250 --> 11:01.416
This story has everything.
Adventure. Crime. Moral quandary.

11:01.500 --> 11:04.458
Will the world rejoice that vicious
criminals have been caught

11:04.541 --> 11:08.291
or breathe a sigh of relief
that a repugnant villain is dead at last?

11:08.375 --> 11:11.666
- "Repugnant"?
- It means "horrendous and disgusting."

11:13.500 --> 11:17.291
Man, I heard that cat
was out-of-sight handsome.

11:17.375 --> 11:19.041
Oh! I wouldn't say handsome.

11:19.125 --> 11:21.666
He had an extraordinarily
ungroomed eyebrow.

11:21.750 --> 11:25.541
No. No! Zonk it on the record,
scribbler dame.

11:25.625 --> 11:26.875
He was pretty

11:26.958 --> 11:31.125
as a shined-up platter of silver nickels
in the mouth of a golden calf.

11:31.208 --> 11:33.250
You have quite a way with words,
Detective.

11:33.333 --> 11:35.666
Oh. You should hear him scat.

11:35.750 --> 11:40.000
Let me just deliver these digestibles
to the troublemaking troublemakers,

11:40.083 --> 11:44.333
then I will zip up here and scoop you up
a lengthy menu. Can you dig it?

11:44.416 --> 11:46.125
I'm not quite following.

11:46.208 --> 11:49.416
He give you interview after he give
Baudelaires bread and water.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.958
Oh!

11:54.500 --> 11:56.500
I love your artwork.

11:58.666 --> 12:01.458
There's joy in my eyes.
Can you see it?

12:01.541 --> 12:03.250
You're wearing sunglasses.

12:04.750 --> 12:08.708
How about now? Do I look like a man
who's about to become very rich?

12:08.791 --> 12:09.708
You won't become rich.

12:09.791 --> 12:11.708
Your scheme will fail,
like they always fail.

12:11.791 --> 12:15.708
Not this time.
You see, a scheme is like a fire.

12:15.791 --> 12:18.291
Everything must be in order
for it to work.

12:18.375 --> 12:22.291
You need matches, torches,
an angry mob that won't listen to reason,

12:22.375 --> 12:24.541
and the right sort of kindling.

12:24.625 --> 12:28.250
Orphans, for instance,
tied to the wooden stake.

12:28.333 --> 12:31.291
If you burn us,
you'll never get the fortune.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.375
Oh, you never know.

12:32.458 --> 12:36.875
One orphan just may escape
amid all the smoke and the confusion.

12:36.958 --> 12:39.333
But for the rest of you, your last meal.

12:39.416 --> 12:42.875
The chef has prepared
some very stale bread

12:42.958 --> 12:46.791
and a cup of water served with
what my Aunt Evelyn liked to call

12:47.500 --> 12:49.125
"a handful of dust."

12:49.875 --> 12:50.875
How does that...

12:52.291 --> 12:54.458
- If you take them off the tray...
- What?

12:55.083 --> 12:57.000
If you take the bread
and water off the tray,

12:57.083 --> 12:58.666
- you can slide them...
- Like this?

12:58.750 --> 13:00.666
You're not...

13:02.833 --> 13:03.875
It's not...

13:06.333 --> 13:07.333
How about this?

13:15.875 --> 13:22.291
Your last meal, Baudelaires,
all alone in the deluxe cell of a jail.

13:22.375 --> 13:25.500
- What makes the cell deluxe?
- It comes with a noose.

13:26.541 --> 13:30.000
There's nobody to save you.
There's nobody to comfort you.

13:30.083 --> 13:31.958
Nobody will even stop by...

13:32.041 --> 13:33.583
- Is it visiting hours?
- Who are you?

13:33.666 --> 13:35.666
Oh, you're that guy
that faints all the time.

13:35.750 --> 13:38.958
It's not something I can control.
I've tried all kinds of herbs.

13:39.041 --> 13:41.583
The police chief said I can come in
and visit the children.

13:41.666 --> 13:43.791
If you faint at the sight of a birdie hat,

13:43.875 --> 13:46.000
I'm not sure
I should leave you with two murderers.

13:46.083 --> 13:47.958
You could stay with me if you want.

13:48.041 --> 13:49.875
Should I tell the reporter
you're unavailable?

13:49.958 --> 13:53.291
- No. No, I'll be right back.
- You sound different.

13:57.458 --> 13:58.791
Are you happy now?

14:01.125 --> 14:02.625
I had to see you on my way out of town.

14:02.708 --> 14:05.750
- You're leaving?
- The hot air mobile home is almost packed,

14:05.833 --> 14:08.125
and the best time to launch
is cocktail hour.

14:08.208 --> 14:10.666
If you escape by then,
you could float away with me.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.750
- That would take deus ex machina.
- What's that?

14:12.833 --> 14:15.583
It's a Latin term meaning
"god from the machine."

14:15.666 --> 14:17.625
Something helpful happening
when you least expect.

14:17.708 --> 14:18.708
That's not going to happen.

14:18.791 --> 14:21.333
We're in a deluxe cell
with bread and water,

14:21.416 --> 14:23.791
about to be burned at the stake
for a crime we didn't commit.

14:23.875 --> 14:26.750
I know you're innocent, Baudelaires.
I tried to help you best I could.

14:26.833 --> 14:30.833
But the Council of Elders overpowered us,
just as they overpowered my poor old ma.

14:30.916 --> 14:32.000
You never told us what happened.

14:33.583 --> 14:35.416
She wore white after Yom Kippur.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.125
The Council caught and punished her.

14:37.208 --> 14:40.875
- Did they burn her at the stake?
- No. She was forced to pay a fine.

14:40.958 --> 14:42.125
- A fine?
- Yes.

14:42.208 --> 14:44.833
Then she moved to the city
and opened up a successful art gallery.

14:44.916 --> 14:47.458
Now it is time to do something difficult.

14:47.541 --> 14:50.000
- Break out of this jail?
- Say goodbye.

14:50.708 --> 14:53.750
You've been dear friends,
and I've enjoyed our time together,

14:53.833 --> 14:56.000
even if that time was spent
doing other people's chores.

14:56.083 --> 14:57.916
Which reminds me, I found this

14:58.000 --> 15:00.625
when I was sweeping the feathers
under Nevermore Tree.

15:01.583 --> 15:05.041
I hope to see you soon, Baudelaires.
Goodbye.

15:05.125 --> 15:06.250
Goodbye.

15:10.583 --> 15:14.416
"The first thing you read contains a clue
An initial way to speak to you

15:14.500 --> 15:17.958
Inside these letters the eye will see
Nearby are your friends and the VFD"

15:19.208 --> 15:20.750
It's two more couplets from Isadora.

15:20.833 --> 15:22.791
A crow must have dropped it
by the Nevermore Tree.

15:22.875 --> 15:23.958
This is all wrong!

15:24.041 --> 15:26.375
We were supposed to free Jacques
and find the Quagmires.

15:26.458 --> 15:28.791
We're in jail, Jacques's dead.
We'll never save our friends.

15:28.875 --> 15:29.708
Unless we break out.

15:30.875 --> 15:32.958
There must be something
I can use for an invention.

15:33.041 --> 15:34.708
Think of something useful you've read.

15:34.791 --> 15:35.916
I...

15:37.125 --> 15:38.416
I just remembered something.

15:38.500 --> 15:42.208
- Will it help us escape?
- No. No. I, um... I...

15:43.000 --> 15:45.916
I just remembered
that it's my birthday today.

15:47.333 --> 15:51.625
- Oh, Klaus. We forgot all about it.
- I forgot, too.

15:51.708 --> 15:54.208
I was thinking of the book
about a boy that goes to prison

15:54.291 --> 15:55.416
and becomes a long-distance runner.

15:55.500 --> 15:58.875
I remembered I got that book
a year ago exactly.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.666
I remember Mother and Father
made that terrible bread pudding.

16:03.666 --> 16:07.291
The worst we ever tasted.
And they promised me that next year

16:07.375 --> 16:09.958
I'd have the best birthday in the world.

16:11.750 --> 16:12.750
I don't mean to sound spoiled,

16:12.833 --> 16:16.875
but I was really hoping for better
than being imprisoned for murder

16:16.958 --> 16:18.375
and burned at the stake.

16:19.375 --> 16:21.291
This is a terrible birthday.

16:26.041 --> 16:28.375
But I think there's a gift
waiting for you.

16:29.375 --> 16:31.541
Stale bread and dusty water?

16:36.375 --> 16:37.750
Deus ex machina.

16:40.125 --> 16:42.625
Yes! Now give me justice.

16:44.833 --> 16:46.291
Protect and serve.

16:48.416 --> 16:50.291
Do you think
that being naturally photogenic

16:50.375 --> 16:51.875
makes you better police officers?

16:51.958 --> 16:54.666
Please! Who could refuse
to stop in the name of the law

16:54.750 --> 16:56.250
after gazing upon this?

16:56.333 --> 17:00.125
My beauty is powerful and instills fear.
Can you dig it?

17:00.208 --> 17:03.250
Yes, I think I can dig that.

17:08.500 --> 17:09.958
Poetry can be difficult to interpret

17:10.040 --> 17:11.790
even when you're not searching
for a hidden message.

17:11.875 --> 17:15.000
This bread is so hard,
I don't even think Sunny could bite it.

17:17.625 --> 17:18.458
Perfect.

17:18.540 --> 17:22.540
Officer Luciana, you seem
like you've been photographed before.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.083
No. Don't be ridiculous.

17:24.165 --> 17:27.290
I always been police officer in
whatever this dusty little town is called.

17:41.583 --> 17:44.833
Baudelaires,
you're annoying the chief of police.

17:44.916 --> 17:47.250
What's that infernal
singing and thwacking?

17:47.333 --> 17:48.750
Don't make me come down there.

17:48.833 --> 17:50.791
It's Klaus' birthday. We're celebrating.

18:04.416 --> 18:08.375
- It's the boy's birthday.
- The teenage years are tough.

18:09.208 --> 18:11.416
Not if you have really long fingernails.

18:11.500 --> 18:14.708
I was the only child in my class
who was not Bar or Bat Mitzvahed.

18:14.791 --> 18:15.916
- Me, too!
- Oh!

18:18.500 --> 18:21.458
Oh! This pounding in my helmet.
I cannot take it.

18:21.541 --> 18:25.041
I am going to blow my top.
And I'm going to blow my cover.

18:25.125 --> 18:28.375
The interview is over.
We have a funeral pyre to build.

18:28.458 --> 18:31.125
I'll interview the townspeople
for some mob mentality angle.

18:31.208 --> 18:32.625
Good thinking, Eleanora.

18:32.708 --> 18:34.291
Hey!

18:50.833 --> 18:53.791
Klaus. You're smiling.

18:53.875 --> 18:56.375
- I am?
- You're in jail, and you're smiling.

18:56.458 --> 18:59.416
- I think I know where the Quagmires are.
- Really?

19:01.000 --> 19:02.333
Look at all four in order.

19:02.416 --> 19:05.333
Isadora couldn't tell us where
she and Duncan were hidden directly

19:05.416 --> 19:06.708
in case the crows were intercepted.

19:06.791 --> 19:08.625
So she hid her location in her poems.

19:08.708 --> 19:10.708
Like Aunt Josephine
hid her location in her note.

19:10.791 --> 19:13.291
"The first thing you read contains a clue"

19:13.375 --> 19:15.541
We initially thought
that was the first poem.

19:15.625 --> 19:18.375
But I think it's the first letter
of each line.

19:18.458 --> 19:21.625
"For sapphires we are held in here
Only you can know our fear"

19:21.708 --> 19:23.833
- So on, until you get...
- "Fountain."

19:26.208 --> 19:27.541
As in, Fowl Fountain.

19:27.625 --> 19:31.125
- That's brilliant. You're brilliant.
- Isadora is brilliant.

19:32.166 --> 19:35.083
And Fowl Fountain
is right outside that very wall.

19:35.166 --> 19:37.208
We'd better keep smashing
that very wall then.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.250
Hey!

19:45.083 --> 19:48.791
Come on, kids.
I guess they couldn't escape.

19:50.916 --> 19:53.041
Ah, cocktail hour.

19:53.125 --> 19:56.166
When the sky is gold
with the promise of fortunes

19:56.250 --> 19:59.916
and sparkling with the light
of a thousand stolen sapphires.

20:00.458 --> 20:02.500
- Who said that?
- What?

20:02.583 --> 20:05.208
- Is it a quote?
- I just made it up, turtledove.

20:05.291 --> 20:08.583
Olaf. You have the soul of a poet.

20:08.666 --> 20:12.000
Yes. And her brother's, too.
We shoved them in that fountain, remember?

20:12.083 --> 20:14.916
Everything is going exactly as I planned.

20:15.541 --> 20:17.750
So, you planned
for Jacques to come to town

20:17.833 --> 20:19.833
so you could frame the Baudelaires
for his murder?

20:19.916 --> 20:22.000
Parts of the plan were unplanned.
That's the plan.

20:22.083 --> 20:23.708
You don't want to overplan a plan.

20:23.791 --> 20:28.500
The point is I'm able to give my ladylove
the best gift in the world...

20:29.958 --> 20:31.833
an enormous fortune.

20:32.750 --> 20:33.958
I already have that.

20:34.041 --> 20:37.708
What I don't have
is the most important part of a tea set.

20:37.791 --> 20:39.708
- The teapot?
- The sugar bowl.

20:39.791 --> 20:42.625
That librarian told me where it is.
I want to go after it.

20:42.708 --> 20:47.958
We will. After we take care
of the Baudelaires, my dumpling.

21:00.833 --> 21:06.166
Goodbye, crow hats! Goodbye, rules!
Goodbye, punishments!

21:06.250 --> 21:09.208
Goodbye, Town Hall,
where I always used to faint.

21:09.291 --> 21:12.916
Goodbye, Uptown Jail,
where I was afraid I'd get locked up.

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
Goodbye, dry saloon
and dry fountain and dry county.

21:17.083 --> 21:19.791
Goodbye, crows. You were scary.

21:19.875 --> 21:22.375
Goodbye, donkey. I'll miss you.

21:22.458 --> 21:25.583
Goodbye, barn. Goodbye, Nevermore Tree.

21:27.125 --> 21:28.500
Goodbye, Baudelaires.

21:38.875 --> 21:43.041
Build faster. The faster we build,
the faster that fortune is mine.

21:44.125 --> 21:47.375
All that's left to decide is
which Baudelaire to smuggle out of town.

21:47.458 --> 21:49.125
The baby. They go with everything.

21:49.208 --> 21:51.708
We have to bring
those Quagmire brats, too.

21:51.791 --> 21:54.666
We could shove them in the red herring
and strap them to the roof.

21:54.750 --> 21:58.791
But that's not viable in the long term.
They'll hit growth spurts eventually.

21:58.875 --> 22:01.333
We need something
big enough to store children

22:01.416 --> 22:04.083
until they come of age
and their fortunes are ours.

22:04.166 --> 22:07.666
A place that's large and mobile
and away from prying eyes.

22:07.750 --> 22:08.958
- Boss.
- Hmm?

22:09.041 --> 22:10.083
Look.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.250
- What is it, darling?
- Something big enough to store orphans.

22:19.333 --> 22:20.750
Like a sack?

22:21.500 --> 22:23.583
Think bigger.

22:24.625 --> 22:27.625
A huge cloud of dust
is not a beautiful thing to look at.

22:27.708 --> 22:31.083
Very few painters have done
portraits of huge clouds of dust.

22:31.166 --> 22:33.000
Directors rarely choose
huge clouds of dust

22:33.083 --> 22:35.166
to play lead roles in romantic comedies.

22:35.250 --> 22:37.041
And, as far as my research has shown,

22:37.125 --> 22:41.291
a huge cloud of dust has never placed
higher than 25th in a beauty pageant.

22:41.375 --> 22:45.000
Nevertheless, the huge cloud of dust
you are about to see on your screen

22:45.083 --> 22:48.500
was the most beautiful cloud of dust
that the Baudelaires ever witnessed.

22:48.583 --> 22:53.000
That is because it was composed of
the brick and mortar of a jailhouse wall.

22:53.083 --> 22:54.166
Hey!

22:55.583 --> 22:58.416
Violet's invention worked.

23:00.541 --> 23:02.083
Your invention worked.

23:03.791 --> 23:06.750
Isadora and Duncan
must be trapped inside the fountain.

23:06.833 --> 23:10.000
Perhaps there's a hidden mechanism
that opens a secret entrance.

23:10.083 --> 23:12.166
There has to be a clue inside the poems.

23:12.250 --> 23:14.666
There's something
that bothered me about them.

23:14.750 --> 23:17.416
"This sad beak" is an odd choice of words,
even for a poet.

23:17.500 --> 23:20.125
Isadora doesn't usually rely
on overly florid imagery.

23:20.208 --> 23:23.041
We jumped to the conclusion
that she meant the VFD crows.

23:23.125 --> 23:25.333
What if she meant
the beak of the Fowl Fountain?

23:26.583 --> 23:28.291
We need to get a closer look.

23:39.166 --> 23:43.750
- Just a little higher.
- Why "beak" and not "crow" or "bird"?

23:43.833 --> 23:47.541
Poets choose their words carefully.
It has to mean something.

23:47.625 --> 23:49.916
I don't know how much longer
we can hold Sunny up.

23:50.750 --> 23:52.083
Do you see anything?

23:56.208 --> 23:58.083
Sunny!

24:09.791 --> 24:10.958
- Duncan!
- Isadora!

24:11.041 --> 24:12.250
You found the poems.

24:12.333 --> 24:14.333
- Are you okay?
- Much better now.

24:14.416 --> 24:15.666
How did you get here?

24:15.750 --> 24:18.166
Olaf smuggled us out of the auction
inside a red herring.

24:18.250 --> 24:20.791
We found it in the saloon.
We knew you were close.

24:22.625 --> 24:25.416
You didn't happen to see
anything written inside?

24:25.500 --> 24:28.000
We didn't have time to examine it closely.

24:28.708 --> 24:29.708
How much farther?

24:29.791 --> 24:32.708
It's hard to say. Just a few miles
as the crow flies. Why?

24:32.791 --> 24:35.375
I see something strange on the horizon.

24:40.166 --> 24:42.208
I was thinking, dearest darling dreamboat,

24:42.291 --> 24:45.166
what if you didn't smuggle
one of the Baudelaires out of town?

24:45.250 --> 24:48.041
Now that you're with me,
it's not like you need the money.

24:48.125 --> 24:51.125
Let them burn. Orphans are out.

24:51.541 --> 24:54.916
And sugar bowls are in...

24:55.000 --> 24:57.958
- You're killing the mood, darling.
- Police! Police!

24:58.041 --> 24:59.333
Scram, police!

24:59.416 --> 25:02.125
Wait, wait! That's us. Right.

25:04.083 --> 25:07.791
I don't know where the chief of police is.
I yelled for her loudly.

25:07.875 --> 25:09.875
Hmm. That always worked with the last one.

25:09.958 --> 25:14.000
This hole is a violation of the rule
against extraneous remodeling!

25:14.083 --> 25:16.458
We have rules that forbid
criminals from escaping,

25:16.541 --> 25:18.583
but not for what to do when they escape.

25:18.666 --> 25:20.708
"Murderers Break Out of Jail!"

25:20.791 --> 25:24.708
Wait until the readers
of the Daily Punctilio hear about this!

25:24.791 --> 25:25.875
This is terrible.

25:25.958 --> 25:28.916
When I told them they couldn't use
their fortune to get out of jail,

25:29.000 --> 25:31.833
I didn't want them
to resort to a battering ram.

25:31.916 --> 25:33.833
We should've expected that
from a murdering baby.

25:33.916 --> 25:35.166
And her accomplices.

25:35.250 --> 25:38.166
How dare they escape?
I gave them bread and water!

25:38.250 --> 25:40.333
Let me handle this, my darling.

25:41.750 --> 25:45.458
Citizens of VFD!
You took the Baudelaire orphans in,

25:45.541 --> 25:49.708
and your kindness was repaid
with misery, rule-breaking and woe.

25:50.416 --> 25:52.333
Will you allow these bambino
to ruin your village,

25:52.416 --> 25:55.291
or are you going to deliver
some woe of your own?

25:55.375 --> 25:56.708
As you stand there squawking,

25:56.791 --> 26:01.708
the Baudelaires are getting away
with murder and rule-breaking.

26:01.791 --> 26:03.333
They are literally getting away!

26:03.416 --> 26:08.833
It's time to unite to hunt down
these criminals and burn them!

26:08.916 --> 26:10.125
Yeah!

26:10.208 --> 26:12.250
- Pitchforks for everyone!
- Who wants a pitchfork?

26:12.333 --> 26:15.083
- Pitchfork! Pitchfork!
- Who wants a pitchfork?

26:17.625 --> 26:18.625
Sugar bowl.

26:19.541 --> 26:21.708
Olaf hid us in the fountain
so we'd be out of his way.

26:21.791 --> 26:23.958
It was Isadora's idea
to use the couplets as a code.

26:24.041 --> 26:25.750
Duncan figured out
how to smuggle them out.

26:25.833 --> 26:29.000
It was damp from dew, and there were
always crows on the fountain.

26:29.083 --> 26:32.583
We waited until one landed
and wrapped a wet couplet around its leg.

26:32.666 --> 26:34.583
The paper dried overnight
and fell from the tree.

26:34.666 --> 26:36.208
How did you know we were here?

26:36.291 --> 26:37.958
We didn't. We just knew you'd find us.

26:38.041 --> 26:39.500
It's what friends are for.

26:41.166 --> 26:42.041
This way.

26:42.958 --> 26:44.208
What do we want?

26:44.291 --> 26:46.291
- And when do we want it?
- Now!

26:46.375 --> 26:48.375
- What do we want?
- To burn children!

26:48.458 --> 26:50.500
- When do we want it?
- Now!

26:50.583 --> 26:52.416
I don't approve of children being burned,

26:52.500 --> 26:54.541
but it is the rules,
and one must follow the rules.

26:54.625 --> 26:56.750
"Angry Mob Leads
to Record Pitchfork Sales!"

26:56.833 --> 26:59.958
Wait until the readers
of the Daily Punctilio hear about this!

27:00.041 --> 27:02.291
- What do we want?
- To burn children!

27:02.375 --> 27:04.500
- When do we want it?
- Now!

27:07.083 --> 27:09.041
- Where can we go?
- We're in the middle of nowhere.

27:09.125 --> 27:11.416
- We know a way out.
- A self-sustaining hot air mobile home.

27:11.500 --> 27:13.000
If we reach the town border,
we can escape.

27:13.083 --> 27:14.375
We'll be safe forever. In the air.

27:14.458 --> 27:16.708
- "Forever"?
- But we'll never learn about VFD.

27:16.791 --> 27:18.583
The real VFD, not this vile village.

27:18.666 --> 27:19.916
Jacques said he was part of it.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.708
That's why he and Olaf
have the same tattoo.

27:21.791 --> 27:23.416
The firehouse was their headquarters.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.833
We wrote everything we learned
in our commonplace books.

27:26.666 --> 27:29.250
What are your thoughts
on your daring escape?

27:29.333 --> 27:31.583
- Run.
- You can't hide from the press!

27:35.791 --> 27:36.625
There!

27:36.708 --> 27:40.166
Where did those two
additional children come from?

27:40.250 --> 27:41.958
Blast those brainy Baudelaires.

27:43.250 --> 27:47.958
Hey, everybody, those half-cat
murder birds have recruited accomplices.

27:48.041 --> 27:51.541
I say we  burn them all!

27:51.625 --> 27:52.750
We need a distraction.

27:52.833 --> 27:55.125
Let's murder them murderers!

27:58.333 --> 27:59.458
Good idea, Sunny.

28:02.666 --> 28:04.458
Aw!

28:04.541 --> 28:08.416
- Look at that donkey go!
- He's adorable!

28:10.916 --> 28:12.375
Oh, he's strutting.

28:17.708 --> 28:19.416
We're out of places to hide.

28:22.333 --> 28:24.958
- Is that a mechanical device?
- It's a motorcycle.

28:25.041 --> 28:26.708
- It's Jacquelyn.
- And Larry the waiter.

28:26.791 --> 28:30.750
There's a term to describe the arrival of
someone helpful when you least expect it.

28:30.833 --> 28:32.916
The term comes from very old plays.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.375
Near the end of the play
when things seem especially dire,

28:36.458 --> 28:40.625
a powerful authority figure arrives
on a mechanical device to save the day.

28:40.708 --> 28:44.875
For this reason, the term for such an
occurrence is "the god from the machine,"

28:44.958 --> 28:49.000
or in the original Latin,
"deus ex machina."

28:49.708 --> 28:52.583
Is that my secretary?
Jacquelyn, what are you doing here?

28:52.666 --> 28:55.000
I could ask you the same question.
All of you.

28:55.083 --> 28:58.166
Where's your conscience?
Where's your sense of decency?

28:58.250 --> 29:00.458
This town should be ashamed of itself.

29:00.541 --> 29:03.916
You city folk don't belong here.
So scat, man.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.208
This is village business.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.166
Some city folk come from villages.
Hello, Mr. Lesko. How's retirement?

29:11.250 --> 29:12.500
- Eh.
- Mrs. Morrow?

29:12.583 --> 29:15.750
You were in a book club with my mothers.
Read anything good lately?

29:15.833 --> 29:18.625
We only read magazines now. I hate it.

29:18.708 --> 29:19.958
This was a good town once,

29:20.041 --> 29:22.958
with good people who helped each other,
who put out fires.

29:23.916 --> 29:26.083
It can be a good town again.

29:26.166 --> 29:27.416
A noble man has been murdered.

29:27.500 --> 29:31.916
Look in your hearts and ask yourselves,
what do you really want?

29:43.166 --> 29:44.166
To burn children!

29:50.333 --> 29:52.958
You can't stop us,
we're the deus ex machina!

29:53.583 --> 29:56.458
They're coming.
How far to the hot air mobile home?

29:56.541 --> 30:00.125
It's not how far, it's how high.
We have to catch it.

30:00.208 --> 30:02.291
- How?
- Burn those kids!

30:02.375 --> 30:05.791
You're out of buildings
to hide behind, orphans.

30:05.875 --> 30:08.541
Burn those kids! Burn those kids!

30:11.375 --> 30:13.291
- Your sister drives?
- Apparently.

30:14.416 --> 30:16.791
- Sunny, keep your eye on that balloon.
- And the road.

30:20.916 --> 30:23.833
- Was the baby driving?
- She's more of a toddler now.

30:24.708 --> 30:26.375
Oh, hi. The orphans are escaping.

30:26.458 --> 30:28.375
Both sets of them. Get the car!

30:29.250 --> 30:32.041
Darling, it's time
to try out your new toy.

30:32.750 --> 30:34.208
Larry. Jacquelyn.

30:35.125 --> 30:39.041
- Now they've destroyed the gas station.
- They had the best wieners.

30:46.625 --> 30:47.583
Hector!

30:47.666 --> 30:51.916
- Baudelaires! I'm so glad you made it!
- I hope you don't mind extra passengers!

30:52.000 --> 30:53.458
Not at all.

30:53.541 --> 30:57.583
The self-sustaining hot air mobile home
needs several people to keep it running!

31:04.375 --> 31:06.000
- You first.
- We'll be right behind you.

31:15.250 --> 31:18.125
Burn those kids! Burn those kids!

31:18.208 --> 31:20.833
It looks like
a self-sustaining hot air mobile home!

31:20.916 --> 31:22.000
Don't let them escape,

31:22.083 --> 31:24.416
or we'll have to find other orphans
to do our chores!

31:24.500 --> 31:25.625
And burn.

31:25.708 --> 31:27.208
Do your own chores!

31:27.291 --> 31:30.250
Or take turns
according to a fair schedule.

31:30.333 --> 31:33.333
The aphorism is,
"It takes a village to raise a child,"

31:33.416 --> 31:35.708
not, "Three children
should clean up after a village."

31:35.791 --> 31:39.416
- Is that Hector?
- He's a traitor and a rule-breaker!

31:39.500 --> 31:41.750
Burn him, too! I'll get more kindling!

31:41.833 --> 31:43.333
Birdland! Groove on this.

31:43.416 --> 31:45.791
I am deputizing
the whole kit and caboodle.

31:45.875 --> 31:50.666
Now let's scoot up that red-hot jalopy
and drag down those killers!

31:53.125 --> 31:55.041
- There's no water.
- They don't know that.

31:55.125 --> 31:56.958
Stand back! She's got a hose.

31:57.041 --> 32:00.041
That's right!
So if you want to stay dry, stay back.

32:00.125 --> 32:02.083
- Right, Klaus?
- Absolutely right.

32:02.166 --> 32:04.750
Although this truck
is a 1956 International R190,

32:04.833 --> 32:07.791
it's been retrofitted to the specs
of a triple-pump La France,

32:07.875 --> 32:09.458
with 800 gallons of water on board,

32:09.541 --> 32:11.583
and anyone who's read
about fire trucks knows

32:11.666 --> 32:14.500
can be shot out at a rate
of 1,600 pounds per square inch.

32:14.583 --> 32:17.083
Which is a lot of power.

32:18.833 --> 32:20.541
- How was that?
- Comprehensive.

32:20.625 --> 32:22.625
Out of my way! Move it!

32:23.291 --> 32:25.458
Is that a harpoon gun?

32:26.291 --> 32:28.333
Sì. My boyfriend bought it for me.

32:28.916 --> 32:32.583
It fires hooked harpoons
that are perfect for popping balloons.

32:32.666 --> 32:35.833
- What if you hit one of the children?
- It's cool, big daddy.

32:43.041 --> 32:44.958
Open fire, officer.

32:48.166 --> 32:50.291
- Isadora!
- Hang on!

32:52.875 --> 32:55.083
- Impressive.
- Well, I do try.

33:05.458 --> 33:07.750
This time I'll hit a handyman.

33:11.541 --> 33:12.541
Oh!

33:12.625 --> 33:13.958
- Oh, no.
- Ooh!

33:14.041 --> 33:16.666
It's okay.
It's just my supply of cranberry juice!

33:16.750 --> 33:18.958
Ooh!

33:19.041 --> 33:21.041
They're almost to the top.

33:21.125 --> 33:24.041
Good. Get Sunny. Start climbing.
I'll hold off the mob.

33:26.500 --> 33:28.000
What are you waiting for? Shoot!

33:28.083 --> 33:30.166
Try loading a harpoon gun
without ruining a manicure.

33:30.250 --> 33:31.500
I have!

33:31.583 --> 33:34.791
I hope the children don't fall!
We need to burn them in a fire!

33:34.875 --> 33:37.625
Burn them in a fire!
Burn them in a fire!

33:37.708 --> 33:40.666
Burn them in a fire! Burn them in a fire!

33:40.750 --> 33:43.666
Burn them in a fire! Burn them in a fire!

33:43.750 --> 33:44.875
Burn them in a fire!

33:47.791 --> 33:50.333
Hurry. The mobile home
can't take any more damage.

33:50.416 --> 33:52.125
He's right. If Esmé hits another balloon,

33:52.208 --> 33:55.416
it'll crash and the Quagmires
will be in danger.

33:55.500 --> 33:58.125
Then we have to let them go.
Hector, head higher!

33:58.208 --> 34:00.833
- But how will you reach us?
- We won't!

34:09.375 --> 34:11.875
- Hold your fire!
- They're climbing down!

34:11.958 --> 34:13.166
They must be surrendering.

34:13.250 --> 34:14.708
- No!
- What are you doing?

34:14.791 --> 34:16.125
What friends are for.

34:16.208 --> 34:18.333
They're getting away
with my sapphires!

34:18.416 --> 34:19.625
Darling, calm down.

34:19.708 --> 34:21.958
I will hit a balloon or an orphan.

34:27.833 --> 34:29.416
Stop shooting at them!

34:29.500 --> 34:31.541
With your mechanical device!

34:31.625 --> 34:33.166
Mechanical device?

34:33.250 --> 34:35.791
Mechanical device?

34:35.875 --> 34:39.291
Officer Luciana,
is that harpoon gun mechanical?

34:39.375 --> 34:41.708
She's breaking rule number 67!

34:41.791 --> 34:44.000
She's capturing murderers,
you square!

34:44.083 --> 34:45.375
The murderers...

34:45.458 --> 34:48.083
The Baudelaires have already come down.
They're not going anywhere.

34:49.041 --> 34:52.875
You can't let people break the rules
to catch people breaking the rules.

34:56.083 --> 34:57.875
They're getting away with my inheritance.

34:57.958 --> 35:00.958
Put down that harpoon gun
in the name of these wonderful birds.

35:01.041 --> 35:03.500
The only bird I like
is in a chicken sandwich.

35:04.958 --> 35:06.583
If we don't see each other again,

35:06.666 --> 35:08.916
this is all the information
about the real VFD!

35:09.000 --> 35:11.250
Everything you need
is in these commonplace books.

35:11.333 --> 35:14.083
- About Olaf's plan.
- About Jacques and his associates.

35:14.166 --> 35:17.291
You helped us, Baudelaires.
I hope we can help you.

35:45.250 --> 35:47.458
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

35:47.541 --> 35:50.375
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Quagmires.

35:50.458 --> 35:51.541
Bye.

35:59.958 --> 36:01.666
You harmed a crow.

36:03.875 --> 36:06.708
You broke rule number one!

36:06.791 --> 36:09.375
That is the most important rule of all.

36:09.458 --> 36:11.500
It's just a stupid bird.

36:11.583 --> 36:14.791
A stupid bird? A stupid bird?

36:14.875 --> 36:17.833
Young man,
this is the Village of Fowl Devotees.

36:17.916 --> 36:20.625
We take our fowl devotion very seriously.

36:23.083 --> 36:25.875
Relax, man. Everything's cool.

36:25.958 --> 36:28.416
Everything was cool before you showed up.

36:28.500 --> 36:31.916
You and your funny talk,
and you with your harpoon guns.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.458
- It'd be a shame to waste the kindling.
- And pitchforks.

36:35.541 --> 36:36.583
Burn them!

36:36.666 --> 36:39.708
Stop in the name of the law!

36:42.500 --> 36:45.875
Stop in the name of the law!

36:49.083 --> 36:50.083
No...

36:51.625 --> 36:52.625
I had everything.

36:52.708 --> 36:56.083
Two sets of orphans. Two sets of fortunes.

36:56.166 --> 37:00.458
And now it's all gone. Gone!

37:00.541 --> 37:02.166
You have not lost everything.

37:02.250 --> 37:06.416
You still have me.
And I have the location of the sugar bowl.

37:06.500 --> 37:08.916
Let's fly this coop.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.041
Where do you think you're going?

37:12.125 --> 37:14.833
Detective Dupin,
you let the murderers escape.

37:14.916 --> 37:19.000
Officer Luciana, you injured a crow.
Now you will pay for your crimes.

37:19.083 --> 37:21.041
Burn them at the stake!

37:21.125 --> 37:24.583
It seems unwise to burn anyone
now that you've lost your fire truck.

37:27.500 --> 37:29.416
Another mechanical device?

37:29.500 --> 37:33.416
That's more than a mechanical device.
It's a getaway vehicle.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.125
Eat my dust!

37:36.375 --> 37:38.833
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Rule-breakers!

37:38.916 --> 37:41.208
- And worse!
- Now we must go after them!

37:41.291 --> 37:42.916
No, citizens.

37:45.125 --> 37:48.000
We need to get this crow to a vet.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.083
- Are the children on board?
- It's the Quagmires.

37:53.166 --> 37:54.875
They're rising higher,

37:54.958 --> 37:57.375
where villainy and treachery
can never reach them.

37:59.291 --> 38:02.000
Then they're finally safe.

38:03.125 --> 38:04.750
They go up so fast.

38:04.833 --> 38:07.833
As the Baudelaires watched
their friends vanish up in the air,

38:07.916 --> 38:10.416
their own feelings
were up in the air as well,

38:10.500 --> 38:13.416
a phrase which here means,
"they weren't sure how to feel."

38:15.291 --> 38:19.083
They felt sad, because they might
never see their friends again.

38:21.958 --> 38:25.500
But they also felt relieved,
because their friends were safe.

38:25.583 --> 38:29.458
And as the self-sustaining
hot air mobile home rose into the sky,

38:29.541 --> 38:33.625
the Baudelaires felt up in the air
about everything that was happening

38:34.250 --> 38:37.500
and the mystery of what would happen next.

38:38.208 --> 38:40.291
- We're going fast.
- We need to keep moving.

38:40.375 --> 38:42.750
- And go where and do what?
- We have to be self-sustaining.

38:42.833 --> 38:45.166
How much did we salvage
from the commonplace books?

38:45.250 --> 38:46.750
Hard to say. Everything's in scraps.

38:46.833 --> 38:50.000
Notes. Research. Sketches. Codes.
This looks like a poem.

38:50.083 --> 38:52.125
- Isadora's?
- It's Duncan's handwriting.

38:52.791 --> 38:56.583
"When you drive away in secret,
you'll be a volunteer."

38:57.500 --> 38:59.583
"So don't scream when we take you."

39:01.958 --> 39:03.791
"The world is quiet here."

39:04.305 --> 39:10.702
