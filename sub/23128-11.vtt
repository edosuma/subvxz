00:01.160 --> 00:02.628
- Previously... on Being Human.

00:02.670 --> 00:04.661
- I may be a flesh eater.
- Like a zombie?

00:04.700 --> 00:06.794
- Stay away from Sally.

00:06.840 --> 00:09.309
She doesn't think she will,
but she'll kill you.

00:09.340 --> 00:11.160
- Stevie, wait!

00:11.210 --> 00:14.430
- Ghost doors can't be the same.
- Something is very wrong.

00:14.480 --> 00:16.175
Everyone's door
is their door.

00:16.210 --> 00:18.144
- We have to figure out
what's on the other side of it.

00:18.180 --> 00:20.319
- But you're all in trouble
with me around.

00:26.690 --> 00:28.385
- (Kat):
My ex is here.

00:28.420 --> 00:30.559
- I'm Aidan Waite.
- Oh, right! Sorry.

00:30.590 --> 00:32.524
Nice to meet you.
Jeff Weston.

00:34.430 --> 00:35.659
- This is Pete.

00:35.700 --> 00:37.395
- Oh! Hi there!

00:38.930 --> 00:40.864
- Oh my God!

00:40.900 --> 00:42.709
- Josh... Josh, go!

00:44.040 --> 00:45.906
- Give me their names.

00:45.940 --> 00:48.602
- I wasn't exactly paying
attention to names, OK?

00:48.640 --> 00:50.176
I was trying to save Pete.

00:50.210 --> 00:52.178
- They killed Pete.
That shouldn't have happened.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.609
- Yeah, because you
never should have told them

00:54.650 --> 00:56.618
that drinking wolf blood
inoculates them.

00:56.650 --> 00:58.948
- The truth was gonna get out.
I got ahead of it.

00:58.990 --> 01:01.960
I put the word out that you
and Nora were off-limits.

01:01.990 --> 01:04.754
I should have remembered Pete.
He didn't deserve that.

01:04.790 --> 01:06.098
- No.

01:06.130 --> 01:07.950
- I told Blake it
only takes a sip.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.593
- Yeah, that's a real shocker

01:09.630 --> 01:12.190
that she and her buddies
didn't use a little restraint.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.868
Listen, I understand

01:14.900 --> 01:17.301
that you were trying
to protect Nora and me.

01:17.340 --> 01:21.470
I just... I can't believe
that you would side with them

01:21.510 --> 01:23.376
over someone like Pete.

01:23.410 --> 01:25.640
- I didn't pick sides!
- Yes, you did!

01:26.920 --> 01:30.515
And the scariest thing is
you don't even realize it.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.684
I'll see you later.

01:38.060 --> 01:40.051
(Siren wailing)

01:44.100 --> 01:45.226
- Morning, Kenny.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.430
Something wrong?

01:48.470 --> 01:50.768
- They found a match for
my bone-marrow transplant.

01:51.810 --> 01:54.131
- That's great!
When can they do it?

01:54.180 --> 01:56.069
- They could schedule it
for never.

01:56.110 --> 01:58.272
I'm not gonna be there.
I'm leaving.

01:58.310 --> 02:00.950
- What are you...
OK, slow down.

02:00.980 --> 02:02.482
With your immune system,

02:02.520 --> 02:04.579
there's a hundred people
between here and Admitting

02:04.620 --> 02:07.453
who'd kill you just by breathing
in your general direction.

02:09.930 --> 02:11.329
- Then turn me.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.428
I knew it.
You're backing out again.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.562
- No!

02:17.600 --> 02:18.920
- You were never
gonna do it.

02:18.970 --> 02:20.938
- The deal was
when you turned 18,

02:20.970 --> 02:22.506
if nothing better came along.

02:22.540 --> 02:23.666
This is better.

02:25.340 --> 02:27.274
Do the procedure.

02:27.310 --> 02:29.244
If it doesn't work,
then I'll turn you.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.977
- I'm not spending months
getting pumped full of chemo,

02:32.010 --> 02:35.344
puking, losing my hair,

02:35.380 --> 02:38.281
crossing my fingers that
my lungs don't shut down

02:38.320 --> 02:40.186
before I even get
the transplant.

02:40.220 --> 02:42.621
And for what?
A 25% success rate?

02:42.660 --> 02:45.789
- Kenny, you've been waiting
for years for this donor.

02:45.830 --> 02:48.424
And if you say no,
then by tomorrow morning,

02:48.460 --> 02:50.792
they'll move to the
next name on the list

02:50.830 --> 02:52.992
and your one shot is gone.

02:53.040 --> 02:57.159
Do this and you can
have a life, a real life.

02:57.210 --> 02:59.372
- For how long?
A couple of years maybe?

02:59.410 --> 03:01.970
That's if my body doesn't
reject the transplant.

03:02.010 --> 03:04.149
I go through all of this

03:04.180 --> 03:07.639
and the thing that ends up
killing me is me.

03:07.680 --> 03:09.387
(Chuckles)

03:11.190 --> 03:13.386
So, all great options.

03:17.490 --> 03:20.528
- If you leave, you're never
gonna see your parents again.

03:20.560 --> 03:23.325
Think about what
that would do to them.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.498
- Give them
their lives back.

03:25.530 --> 03:27.567
Oh, come on,
think about it.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.001
They have felt so guilty
that I'm in here,

03:30.040 --> 03:32.839
they have completely
forgotten about themselves.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.178
They've spent their
life savings and then some

03:35.210 --> 03:36.405
on surgeries like this.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.248
They deserve a life too,

03:38.280 --> 03:42.069
and one that they don't
spend in a sickroom.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.680
- You'll be dead
in 2 days out there.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.085
- Not if I'm what you are.

03:46.120 --> 03:47.986
- I'm not gonna let you leave.
- OK then.

03:48.020 --> 03:49.522
- I'm not gonna
let you leave!

03:49.560 --> 03:50.857
- It's fine.

03:51.930 --> 03:54.399
I can wait, you know,
until your shift's over

03:54.430 --> 03:55.989
and I'll sneak out.

03:56.030 --> 03:57.668
I'll call Blake.

03:57.700 --> 04:01.933
You know, maybe join some
vampire meet-up or something.

04:01.970 --> 04:05.406
OK, regardless of
your help or not...

04:06.780 --> 04:09.078
I'm leaving today, OK?

04:09.110 --> 04:12.319
So... what's it gonna be?

04:23.090 --> 04:25.127
(Air hissing)

04:25.160 --> 04:26.753
(Sighs)

04:37.270 --> 04:38.533
- OK, great.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.208
We don't have a lot
of time. Come on.

04:40.240 --> 04:43.744
* Take it off
Take it in *

04:43.780 --> 04:47.239
* Take off all the thoughts
of what we've been *

04:47.280 --> 04:50.580
* Take a look hesitate

04:50.620 --> 04:54.158
* Take a picture
you could never recreate *

04:54.190 --> 04:56.830
* Write a song
Make a note... *

04:56.860 --> 04:58.624
(Laughing)

04:58.660 --> 05:01.652
* For the lump that sits
inside your throat *

05:01.700 --> 05:04.965
* Change the locks
Change the scene... *

05:05.000 --> 05:07.332
(Kenny laughing)

05:07.370 --> 05:09.702
- It's so disgusting.
I love it!

05:12.140 --> 05:13.630
Are you seeing this?

05:13.680 --> 05:15.933
This grass, it is so...
It's so green!

05:15.980 --> 05:17.141
- OK, all right.

05:17.180 --> 05:19.148
Maybe take it down a notch

05:19.180 --> 05:21.547
before you're arrested
for shrooming in public.

05:21.580 --> 05:23.139
- Oh yeah, sorry.
- Come on.

05:23.190 --> 05:24.339
- Thank you. Sorry.

05:24.390 --> 05:25.619
- You think this is intense,

05:25.650 --> 05:27.789
wait till after
you're turned.

05:27.820 --> 05:29.549
- Well, um,

05:29.590 --> 05:33.299
I know that I pressured you
to turn me into what you are,

05:33.330 --> 05:37.824
but can I have one day
as a teenager, please?

05:37.870 --> 05:40.498
- You're about to spend
an eternity as a teenager.

05:40.540 --> 05:43.464
- Well, yeah, but not as,
like, a human one.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.638
I've never gotten
to do that.

05:45.670 --> 05:48.002
I wanna drink
and eat and do drugs.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.849
- OK, slow down, Scarface.

05:49.880 --> 05:53.339
- I just wanna do all the stuff
that won't affect me

05:53.380 --> 05:56.145
when I'm a, you know...

05:56.180 --> 05:57.739
lord of the night.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.383
(Sighs)

06:00.460 --> 06:04.090
- One day. And don't
ever call us that.

06:04.130 --> 06:05.529
- Sorry.

06:05.560 --> 06:08.097
- When we get
to my place...

06:08.130 --> 06:12.533
* Your Trojan's in my head

06:16.240 --> 06:19.870
* Take it off
Take it in *

06:19.910 --> 06:24.746
* Take off all the thoughts
of what we've been **

06:27.880 --> 06:29.848
- Whatever Donna has planned
for my soul when I die,

06:29.890 --> 06:30.846
that's bad enough.

06:30.890 --> 06:34.383
But if I hurt you guys?
I can't deal with that.

06:34.420 --> 06:36.889
- I'm not padlocking you
into your own room.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.250
- Josh, you have to!

06:38.290 --> 06:39.758
- I'm not going to do that!

06:39.800 --> 06:40.824
- You have to, Josh.

06:40.860 --> 06:43.568
I'm starving and may not
be able to control myself.

06:43.600 --> 06:46.433
You guys need to walk down
the aisle intact.

06:48.500 --> 06:51.902
I wanted to be at
your wedding, you know.

06:51.940 --> 06:53.430
I know this sounds cheesy,

06:53.480 --> 06:55.733
but you guys are seriously
the hope for the future.

06:57.610 --> 06:59.715
I wanted to make a toast.

06:59.750 --> 07:00.876
I wanted to cry

07:00.920 --> 07:03.548
and I wanted to
get drunk and dance

07:03.590 --> 07:06.389
and say inappropriate things.

07:06.420 --> 07:08.081
I love you guys.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.557
So, please just...

07:12.630 --> 07:14.428
Please lock me up.

07:14.460 --> 07:16.724
And use 2 locks.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.068
I may have zombie strength
and not know it.

07:19.100 --> 07:22.559
- We're not giving up on you.
And we are gonna find you food.

07:22.610 --> 07:23.736
- You are food.

07:25.640 --> 07:27.074
- OK...

07:32.780 --> 07:36.011
<i>Let's get moving.
The meet and greets...</i>

07:40.960 --> 07:43.588
Hey, guys.
You remember Kenny, right?

07:43.630 --> 07:45.485
- Sure, yeah,
from the hospital.

07:45.530 --> 07:47.953
- Where he's usually sealed
in a protective room

07:48.000 --> 07:49.593
that prevents him
from dying.

07:49.630 --> 07:52.600
From what I understand.
Hi, Kenny.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.438
- You haven't
told them yet?

07:54.470 --> 07:55.631
- No, he hasn't told us.

07:55.670 --> 07:57.263
- Why don't you
throw your stuff

07:57.310 --> 07:59.608
downstairs in the basement
in my room,

07:59.640 --> 08:02.337
- Wait, you don't want me to
call you a lord of the night,

08:02.380 --> 08:04.007
but you live in the basement?

08:04.050 --> 08:06.007
- Ha ha, very funny.
Come on.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.449
- I'm just saying.

08:13.790 --> 08:15.485
- So there's that.

08:15.520 --> 08:18.979
- I know this is a surprise,
but Kenny moved up the timeline.

08:19.030 --> 08:20.555
OK...

08:21.560 --> 08:23.824
He gave me clean blood,

08:23.870 --> 08:27.329
so I made a deal to,
uh, save him.

08:27.370 --> 08:30.010
- You mean to turn him?
- Yeah.

08:31.210 --> 08:33.837
- Aidan, how is
cursing him to a life

08:33.880 --> 08:36.850
that you claim to hate
saving him exactly?

08:36.880 --> 08:39.405
- I will keep him in check.

08:39.450 --> 08:43.818
- So he's gonna bunk
with you now, downstairs,

08:43.850 --> 08:45.909
like, for eternity?

08:45.950 --> 08:47.509
- He's going to
stay down there

08:47.560 --> 08:49.187
until he is used
to his new life.

08:49.220 --> 08:50.483
- Between Stevie and Erin,

08:50.530 --> 08:52.999
we don't exactly have
the best track record

08:53.030 --> 08:54.759
with wayward teens, Aidan.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.097
- This will be different.

08:56.130 --> 08:58.360
It has to be different.

08:58.400 --> 09:02.359
I understand you're upset
with me about Pete.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.267
Please do not
punish Kenny for that.

09:05.310 --> 09:06.573
- You're right.

09:08.910 --> 09:11.902
We have so many reasons
to hate what we are.

09:13.920 --> 09:17.049
But if we can use our curse
to help someone,

09:17.090 --> 09:18.717
then I say we do it.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.928
- Did I pretend to put
my stuff away long enough?

09:24.960 --> 09:26.758
- We're good.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.428
- Come on, let's go.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.193
(Door closing)

09:36.240 --> 09:38.902
- I know that you think that
I went too easy on Aidan,

09:38.940 --> 09:41.102
but Kenny's dying.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.944
If that was your friend,

09:44.980 --> 09:47.642
you would do whatever
you could to save them.

09:51.620 --> 09:53.110
- You're right.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.110
Sally!

09:57.960 --> 10:00.054
- I appreciate you guys
trying to protect me,

10:00.100 --> 10:02.398
but going after Donna
is a bad idea.

10:02.430 --> 10:04.159
- What other choice
do we have?

10:04.200 --> 10:06.931
- Donna only gets your soul
if she's alive to collect it.

10:06.970 --> 10:08.665
- Wow, you went dark fast.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.566
- Well, it's either
you or Donna.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.170
When you go through that door,
you're stepping into her world.

10:13.210 --> 10:15.099
So we have to take
her out in our world,

10:15.140 --> 10:17.142
where we have a chance
and we can help you.

10:17.180 --> 10:18.841
- We tried that, remember?

10:18.880 --> 10:21.144
She Vader-choked me and then
I started craving puppies.

10:21.180 --> 10:22.784
I'd rather not
piss her off again,

10:22.820 --> 10:24.242
considering now
she has my soul.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.088
- That time, we wandered in
there like doe-eyed children.

10:26.120 --> 10:29.112
This time, we don't
give her a chance.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.788
- OK, guns and witches.
What could go wrong?

10:31.830 --> 10:33.457
Do you even have a plan?

10:33.500 --> 10:35.059
- Yeah, I'm gonna kill her.

10:37.500 --> 10:40.538
- You sure this is
the right address?

10:40.570 --> 10:42.766
- I'm telling you,

10:42.810 --> 10:45.507
the soup kitchen
was right here.

10:45.540 --> 10:48.805
- A building can't
just disappear.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.376
- Tell that to Donna.

10:52.010 --> 10:53.842
I'm so screwed.

10:56.820 --> 11:00.313
- This is my fault.
I got Sally into this mess.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.010
- She doesn't blame you.

11:03.690 --> 11:06.990
Hey, she got to live,

11:07.030 --> 11:10.796
got her body back,
got a little undertaker action.

11:10.830 --> 11:12.468
- Became a cannibal.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.537
- Let's try not to
focus on the negative.

11:14.570 --> 11:16.390
- There's gotta
be something.

11:16.440 --> 11:19.205
Gotta be something
we can do to help.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.370
(Sighs)

11:24.410 --> 11:26.048
- This won't save anyone,

11:26.080 --> 11:29.448
but it might help take
her mind off what's coming.

11:32.050 --> 11:34.212
What if we got married now?

11:34.260 --> 11:37.082
So that Sally
could be there.

11:40.760 --> 11:43.092
- She's only got,
like, a day or two.

11:43.130 --> 11:44.620
- So we do it fast.

11:45.730 --> 11:48.062
You don't really talk
to your parents anyway.

11:48.100 --> 11:51.138
And the only thing my family
would do is ruin it.

11:52.940 --> 11:55.102
- So just the family
we have here.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.670
- Before we lose it.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.445
Sally?

12:07.290 --> 12:08.917
Sally?

12:15.530 --> 12:17.089
Sally!

12:17.130 --> 12:19.622
- We've gotta find her
before she finds lunch.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.709
- Hey.

12:28.740 --> 12:31.778
- I wasn't sure I was
gonna see you again.

12:31.810 --> 12:34.609
- I wasn't sure if I should
come here, but, um...

12:38.150 --> 12:39.811
I'm running out of options.

12:41.390 --> 12:43.188
And, um...

12:45.160 --> 12:47.629
I feel like I can
tell you everything.

12:47.660 --> 12:50.595
- Except for why your roommates
came home looking like

12:50.630 --> 12:52.394
they were stunt doubles
from a Bourne movie.

12:52.430 --> 12:54.398
- I should've
told you about that.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.829
I will tell you about that.

12:56.870 --> 13:00.033
But right now,
it's just...

13:00.080 --> 13:03.300
My body's, like,
running out of time.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.547
- I'll get my kit.

13:07.580 --> 13:10.220
- I'm actually
past the putty phase.

13:12.520 --> 13:15.410
- What's wrong?
- Um...

13:17.190 --> 13:20.023
The hunger that I was
telling you about...

13:20.060 --> 13:24.668
So when my body started
breaking down, uh...

13:24.700 --> 13:26.668
It's just 'cause...

13:26.700 --> 13:29.362
So regular food
stopped working.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.334
- What's working now?

13:31.370 --> 13:35.500
- Uh, it's more of,
like, a raw-food diet.

13:35.540 --> 13:38.202
- Oh God, you're not talking
about veggies, are you?

13:39.550 --> 13:42.850
- OK, don't freak out.
- I'm not making any promises.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.415
- Human flesh.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.009
Not yours.
I--1... Not yours!

13:48.060 --> 13:51.030
I'm here because I don't
wanna hurt anybody.

13:51.060 --> 13:52.858
Are you kidding?

13:52.900 --> 13:56.200
I would never eat
an actual living...

13:57.430 --> 14:00.695
But, OK, if I don't...
If I don't...

14:00.740 --> 14:04.199
If I don't, then I
at least need to...

14:06.640 --> 14:09.371
OK, I can't believe
I'm saying this.

14:09.410 --> 14:12.209
And I--I don't
expect you to...

14:12.250 --> 14:14.548
I know this is a lot
for you to handle, but...

14:14.580 --> 14:17.049
So, this morning,

14:17.090 --> 14:20.116
I saw this obit
for Mrs. Hanover.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.389
- Sally...

14:21.420 --> 14:22.717
- She didn't have any kids.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.524
She didn't want
a memorial service.

14:24.560 --> 14:25.880
She wanted to be cremated.

14:25.930 --> 14:27.728
- You can't eat Ms. Hanover!

14:27.760 --> 14:30.400
- I know how awful it sounds.
- I don't think you do.

14:30.430 --> 14:31.898
- I do!
I really do, trust me.

14:31.930 --> 14:33.534
You think I wanna be
standing here

14:33.570 --> 14:35.038
in front of the guy I love

14:35.070 --> 14:36.936
asking to eat the dead body
in the freezer?

14:42.510 --> 14:44.478
- I have wanted to tell you

14:44.510 --> 14:47.719
that I have loved you
for so long,

14:47.750 --> 14:51.948
and I've waited because
I thought it was too soon.

14:53.320 --> 14:55.152
- Now I told you too late.

14:58.390 --> 15:00.996
The witch that
I told you about,

15:01.030 --> 15:03.124
the one who
did this to me,

15:03.170 --> 15:05.867
when I die,
she gets my soul.

15:05.900 --> 15:08.790
And when I made that deal,
I thought I was OK with it.

15:08.840 --> 15:12.003
But now, I'm scared.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.438
- Where does it stop?

15:16.480 --> 15:19.541
What if this doesn't work?
What if you come for me?

15:19.580 --> 15:21.674
- I would never hurt you.

15:27.760 --> 15:32.084
- The reason that I helped you
in the first place...

15:33.060 --> 15:35.700
it's the same reason
that I can't help you now.

15:35.730 --> 15:39.724
Watching over the dead
is my responsibility.

15:39.770 --> 15:41.989
If you knew me at all,

15:42.040 --> 15:45.032
you'd know better
than to ask that.

15:54.420 --> 15:57.185
- Hey. Any word from Sally?

15:57.220 --> 16:00.758
- Yeah, she's, uh,
safe and sound.

16:00.790 --> 16:04.226
- Cool. Um, so you're
looking at magazines?

16:04.260 --> 16:05.523
Uh...

16:05.560 --> 16:07.096
- We're planning
our honeymoon.

16:07.130 --> 16:09.519
- Did you set a date already?
- Thursday.

16:09.560 --> 16:15.260
We wanted to make sure that
Sally was still... in town.

16:15.300 --> 16:16.529
So how was
your first day out?

16:16.570 --> 16:18.561
- Awesome. Red Sox game,

16:18.610 --> 16:20.374
lobster rolls,
which were pretty good.

16:20.410 --> 16:22.606
Oh, Aidan also
snuck me a beer,

16:22.640 --> 16:24.278
which was actually
kind of gross.

16:24.310 --> 16:25.903
I'm killing my human
bucket list.

16:25.950 --> 16:27.577
- Come on, Kenny.

16:28.950 --> 16:30.440
- Hey!

16:30.490 --> 16:32.948
- Oh my God!
Hi, hi, hi!

16:32.990 --> 16:35.015
What are you doing here?

16:35.060 --> 16:36.880
- Ask your fiance.

16:36.920 --> 16:38.729
- I will ask my fiance.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.558
- I know
we said no family,

16:40.600 --> 16:44.127
but I knew that you'd want
Emily there at the wedding,

16:44.170 --> 16:45.592
which is on Thursday.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.268
- It's on Thursday!
- Don't worry.

16:47.300 --> 16:49.462
I'm only here long enough
to grab my brother

16:49.500 --> 16:51.764
and take him out for
a proper bachelor party.

16:51.810 --> 16:54.279
- Yes! That's a great idea!

16:54.310 --> 16:55.436
- Oh! It is?

16:55.480 --> 16:57.471
- Yes!
- Ah!

16:57.510 --> 16:59.569
- You guys have to
go out now. Be gone!

16:59.610 --> 17:01.578
- Everybody grab
your Washingtons.

17:01.620 --> 17:03.645
Let's check out some boobage.
Who's with me?

17:03.690 --> 17:05.249
- Yes, I am with you
on that one.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.916
- Excellent!
Who are you?

17:06.950 --> 17:08.816
- I'm Kenny, uh, Aidan's...

17:08.859 --> 17:10.726
- Cousin-in-law.
From Providence.

17:10.760 --> 17:14.753
- Yes. And going to a strip club
is number one on my bucket list.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.325
- All right.

17:16.359 --> 17:18.727
Well, not sure why a teenager
has a bucket list,

17:18.770 --> 17:20.636
but if we're sneaking
Peach Fuzz in,

17:20.670 --> 17:23.435
we've gotta find a place
that doesn't serve booze.

17:23.470 --> 17:26.109
- What's the point then really?
- No point.

17:26.140 --> 17:27.107
- Are you in?

17:27.140 --> 17:28.505
- Sure!
- Yes!

17:28.540 --> 17:30.144
- Go and have fun.

17:30.180 --> 17:32.444
- You're enjoying this too much.
- I am enjoying this.

17:32.480 --> 17:35.609
- She's got beautiful hair
for a septuagenarian.

17:35.650 --> 17:37.345
- See, none of
my other assistants

17:37.390 --> 17:39.210
ever notice
that kind of thing.

17:42.490 --> 17:45.460
Prepping her for the viewing
should be a breeze.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.696
- Hey, thanks for
letting me come back.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.469
I should have just told you
everything before.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.639
I was just scared.

17:57.670 --> 18:00.970
- It's OK.
I'm just glad you're back.

18:01.010 --> 18:03.172
(Phone vibrating)

18:04.510 --> 18:07.946
And no more secrets, right?

18:07.980 --> 18:09.846
- Right.
- OK.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.564
(Flesh tearing)

18:33.810 --> 18:35.209
(Gasps)

18:39.910 --> 18:41.912
(Panting)

18:55.100 --> 18:56.659
- Oh...

19:06.440 --> 19:08.738
- (Man): Oh!

19:08.780 --> 19:10.976
* Come on now

19:11.010 --> 19:13.069
* One two three four...

19:13.110 --> 19:14.271
- (Man on PA):
Yes, it's time

19:14.320 --> 19:16.914
to put your hands together,
gentlemen,

19:16.950 --> 19:19.612
because stepping up onto
the stage right now

19:19.650 --> 19:21.288
is sexy Sadie.

19:21.320 --> 19:25.621
* I like the way
you get down baby... *

19:25.660 --> 19:27.856
- I think I'm in love.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.265
- Whoa! What are you doing?

19:31.300 --> 19:33.166
- What?
- You can't touch.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.965
- Oh, sorry. I, um...

19:36.000 --> 19:38.264
I've just never gotten
this close before.

19:38.310 --> 19:39.607
- To a stripper?

19:39.640 --> 19:40.971
- To a girl.

19:43.810 --> 19:46.973
- By the way, you're wasting
your time with Sadie.

19:47.010 --> 19:48.273
- Why?

19:48.320 --> 19:50.140
- Uh...

19:50.180 --> 19:53.457
She's playing for my team,
not yours.

19:53.490 --> 19:54.958
- No way!

19:54.990 --> 19:57.459
- Yeah, half the strippers
here are gay.

19:57.490 --> 19:59.026
- (Kenny): Wow!

20:00.060 --> 20:02.825
In a few days,
even they'll want me.

20:02.860 --> 20:04.168
(Laughing)

20:04.200 --> 20:06.191
- OK. I
- No, I'm serious.

20:06.230 --> 20:09.689
I could have any girl here.

20:09.740 --> 20:12.801
- Hey, Kenny!
All right, pal.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.535
She'll still
be there for you.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.332
Come here.
- One sec.

20:17.880 --> 20:21.373
- Can you get me and Josh
some more orange juice?

20:21.420 --> 20:24.139
Also, the first rule
of vampires,

20:24.190 --> 20:26.682
do not talk
about vampires, OK?

20:26.720 --> 20:28.950
- OK.
- Good! Go.

20:28.990 --> 20:30.879
* One two three four...

20:32.590 --> 20:34.228
Oh, that was a close one.

20:34.260 --> 20:37.025
- Turning this kid
doesn't worry you at all?

20:37.060 --> 20:39.529
You squint and he
even looks like Henry.

20:39.570 --> 20:41.664
- Kenny and Henry
are totally different.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.236
- I don't think they are.

20:43.270 --> 20:46.706
You took pity on someone
who was weak and who helped you.

20:46.740 --> 20:48.378
What's the difference?

20:48.410 --> 20:50.799
- What's...
Let's forget about them.

20:50.850 --> 20:53.478
I am 180 degrees off
who I was when I made Henry.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.045
- No, you're not.
- I'm not?

20:55.080 --> 20:56.673
Please tell me,
who was I?

20:56.720 --> 20:58.688
- No, you used to be,
when you disowned vampires,

20:58.720 --> 21:02.384
when you looked out
for people like Pete.

21:02.420 --> 21:04.354
- I'm sorry about Pete.

21:04.390 --> 21:07.724
I am. But this Kenny thing,
it's not a trend.

21:07.760 --> 21:11.094
It's me paying someone back
for saving my life, OK?

21:11.130 --> 21:13.440
That's all.
That's all it is.

21:13.470 --> 21:16.599
- You two need to stop talking.
- What do you mean?

21:16.640 --> 21:18.563
- Only creepy dudes
come to strip clubs

21:18.610 --> 21:20.066
and look as serious
as you do.

21:20.110 --> 21:22.272
OK? Don't be
those dudes.

21:22.310 --> 21:24.574
- Creepy? It's weird
that you'd say that.

21:24.610 --> 21:26.374
- Whatever. Sadie!

21:26.410 --> 21:28.117
Lap dance
for my bro-ham!

21:28.150 --> 21:29.447
- What are you doing?

21:29.480 --> 21:32.711
- Saving you
from yourself. Hmm?

21:32.750 --> 21:34.388
Go.

21:34.420 --> 21:36.752
(Woman giggling)

21:36.790 --> 21:38.258
Go.

21:38.290 --> 21:40.156
- You know,
it's true what they say.

21:40.190 --> 21:42.249
The bachelor party
isn't for the groom.

21:42.300 --> 21:43.927
It's for the groom's
gay sister.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.267
(Laughing)

21:45.300 --> 21:47.439
- You're welcome.
- Yeah, thanks. Yeah.

21:47.470 --> 21:49.461
* One two three four

21:49.500 --> 21:52.629
* I like the way
you get down baby *

21:52.670 --> 21:56.675
* I like the way
you get down baby *

21:56.710 --> 22:00.772
* I like the way
you get down baby *

22:00.820 --> 22:04.643
* I like the way
you get down *3*

22:13.830 --> 22:15.320
- Sally?

22:26.570 --> 22:29.471
- (Sally): Why'd you slide
a penis straw through the door?

22:29.510 --> 22:31.478
- Because it's not
a bachelorette party

22:31.510 --> 22:33.547
without penis straws,

22:33.580 --> 22:35.309
or my maid of honour.

22:35.350 --> 22:38.012
- You want me to be
your maid of honour?

22:38.050 --> 22:40.280
- Only if you fulfill
your maidly duties

22:40.320 --> 22:42.687
and help me polish off
these wine coolers.

22:43.690 --> 22:44.987
- Wine coolers?

22:45.030 --> 22:48.489
- All of my wedding fantasies
date back to the 9th grade.

22:48.530 --> 22:50.157
I'm feeling nostalgic.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.565
(Chuckles)

22:51.600 --> 22:53.159
Can I open the door?

22:56.700 --> 22:57.861
- OK.

23:21.530 --> 23:23.350
(Lock clicking)

23:27.740 --> 23:31.199
I really wanna come out there,
but I also really wanna eat you.

23:31.240 --> 23:32.765
- I understand.

23:32.810 --> 23:34.039
Hey!

23:34.080 --> 23:35.536
For short notice,

23:35.580 --> 23:37.878
I think I found a pretty
great wedding dress.

23:37.910 --> 23:39.742
Do you wanna see it?

23:39.780 --> 23:41.441
- I do!

23:42.720 --> 23:44.711
But only from a safe distance.

23:44.750 --> 23:47.856
I think I have a pretty
great view of the street

23:47.890 --> 23:49.358
from my window.

23:49.390 --> 23:51.256
- Maybe TI'll take a picture.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.095
- OK.

23:55.130 --> 23:56.598
- I'm having
a hard time deciding

23:56.630 --> 23:58.928
which way to go
with my hair though.

23:58.970 --> 24:00.392
- When in doubt, side pony.

24:00.430 --> 24:04.765
- See? This is why I need you.
Now, how about flowers?

24:07.340 --> 24:10.605
(Woman singing,
lyrics indistinct)

24:15.650 --> 24:17.140
- You can relax.

24:17.180 --> 24:18.944
- Mm-hmm.

24:20.450 --> 24:24.159
Uh, yeah, full disclosure,

24:24.190 --> 24:27.956
I'm, uh,
getting married tomorrow.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.650
- Oh...

24:29.700 --> 24:31.919
You and half
the guys in here.

24:33.470 --> 24:36.269
I'll keep it
R-rated... mostly.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.802
(Laughing)

24:40.510 --> 24:42.501
I get the vibe you
don't wanna be here.

24:42.540 --> 24:43.644
- You do?

24:43.680 --> 24:45.307
- It's all right.

24:46.980 --> 24:48.311
- So how long...

24:48.350 --> 24:50.512
How long have you,
uh, worked here?

24:50.550 --> 24:52.143
- Um, a few months.

24:52.190 --> 24:53.385
- Mm-hmm.

24:53.420 --> 24:54.979
- Um...

24:55.020 --> 24:58.058
Gotta straighten out
some personal stuff.

24:58.090 --> 24:59.819
Yeah, I'm kind of
in a rut.

24:59.860 --> 25:01.350
(Josh laughs)

25:01.400 --> 25:03.869
- I'm sure you'll
dig your way out of it.

25:05.030 --> 25:07.499
- You know what?

25:07.540 --> 25:09.190
I think I just did.

25:09.240 --> 25:10.901
(Josh grunting)

25:15.380 --> 25:17.508
- Hey, lady,
not this one. Hey!

25:17.550 --> 25:21.509
- Screw you!
My werewolf, my cure.

25:21.550 --> 25:22.870
- No! Ah!

25:27.890 --> 25:30.086
- Dammit! Are you OK?

25:30.120 --> 25:33.181
- Yeah. Are you all of
a sudden carrying stakes? Why?

25:33.230 --> 25:35.597
- Why do you think?
You're starting to smell wolfy.

25:35.630 --> 25:38.600
- What?
- You smell like a werewolf!

25:41.070 --> 25:43.869
- Em... Emily!

25:43.910 --> 25:45.708
Em! Wait!
Wait a second!

25:45.740 --> 25:47.230
Wait, wait, wait!

25:47.270 --> 25:48.533
- What the hell was that?

25:48.580 --> 25:49.832
- That stripper wasn't
just a stripper.

25:49.880 --> 25:52.577
- Your roommate just
stabbed her in the back!

25:52.610 --> 25:54.078
- He saved my life, OK?

25:54.120 --> 25:55.679
- And then she
just disappeared!

25:55.720 --> 25:56.846
- She turned to dust.

25:56.880 --> 25:59.087
That's what happens to
his kind, to vampires.

25:59.120 --> 26:00.849
- Vampires?

26:00.890 --> 26:03.416
- Fangs, black eyes,
dust, vampires.

26:04.430 --> 26:06.421
- So Aidan is a...

26:06.460 --> 26:07.530
- Yeah.

26:07.560 --> 26:09.426
- Aidan called you
a werewolf,

26:09.460 --> 26:13.419
- I used to be one,
and then I wasn't.

26:16.770 --> 26:18.568
And now I'm gonna
be one again.

26:21.610 --> 26:23.806
- Does Nora know?

26:28.480 --> 26:29.777
- She's one too.

26:32.350 --> 26:35.456
There were so many times
I wanted to tell you,

26:35.490 --> 26:37.288
that I--I tried...

26:38.790 --> 26:40.997
- So your journals...

26:42.130 --> 26:45.464
all that stuff you said...

26:48.770 --> 26:51.102
that's really why you left?

26:51.140 --> 26:55.270
- I couldn't handle it,
what I'd become.

26:55.310 --> 26:58.769
I was trying to protect you
from all of this.

26:58.810 --> 27:01.279
That's why I didn't
tell you. I--I...

27:01.320 --> 27:02.719
- I can see why.

27:06.150 --> 27:10.656
How often does your roommate
stab random people?

27:10.690 --> 27:13.182
- She was gonna
kill me, Em.

27:14.730 --> 27:16.653
She would have killed me.

27:16.700 --> 27:19.328
- Have you ever done
anything like that?

27:19.370 --> 27:22.340
- Not exactly, but yeah.

27:23.400 --> 27:27.837
I wish this wasn't me,
but it is.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.201
And Aidan and Nora get that.
They get me.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.799
- Well, if you
hate it so much,

27:31.850 --> 27:34.979
then why are you marrying
into it and doubling down?

27:35.020 --> 27:38.479
And why are you living
with someone like Aidan

27:38.520 --> 27:40.784
who brings more of that
into your life?

27:40.820 --> 27:42.356
- We look out
for each other.

27:42.390 --> 27:44.529
You're my sister!

27:44.560 --> 27:46.358
We accept each other.

27:46.390 --> 27:49.451
I accept you, Em,
for everything that you are.

27:49.500 --> 27:52.128
- Are you comparing murder
to being gay?

27:52.170 --> 27:53.319
- No.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.138
- Really?
- No.

27:56.170 --> 27:59.538
- 'Cause those things aren't
even in the same solar system.

27:59.570 --> 28:00.969
- That's not what I meant.

28:01.010 --> 28:03.604
You felt alone. You were
scared to talk about it.

28:03.640 --> 28:07.042
- Aidan just killed someone!

28:08.080 --> 28:10.549
Something, whatever.

28:10.580 --> 28:14.710
I wish I was OK with that.
I really do.

28:27.430 --> 28:29.330
- (Aidan): Hey, man.

28:32.440 --> 28:33.930
I think it's time.

28:40.310 --> 28:41.744
- Are those for me?

28:41.780 --> 28:44.750
- Yeah, 3 bags of O Negative

28:44.790 --> 28:48.090
and one werewolf
booster shot.

28:50.460 --> 28:52.258
For when you wake up.

28:55.460 --> 28:57.121
- OK, look,

28:57.160 --> 29:00.664
I know that, um,
I asked for this.

29:01.700 --> 29:04.340
But what you did
to the stripper...

29:05.410 --> 29:06.559
is that gonna happen to me?

29:06.610 --> 29:10.899
- No, it won't, because you
won't be reckless like that.

29:14.980 --> 29:17.847
- When's the last time
that you've done this?

29:17.890 --> 29:20.313
You know, made someone?

29:25.560 --> 29:27.654
- It's been a while.

29:29.860 --> 29:34.400
- Like, um, a couple years?

29:34.440 --> 29:36.534
- More like a hundred.

29:36.570 --> 29:40.131
- And what happened
to the last one?

29:40.170 --> 29:41.672
- The virus got him.

29:43.680 --> 29:46.172
- OK, so what you're
saying is that

29:46.210 --> 29:49.840
this whole vampire immortality
thing isn't a lock.

29:49.880 --> 29:50.984
- Kenny...

29:51.020 --> 29:52.510
- What?

29:54.520 --> 29:57.217
- The only thing that
you have to know

29:57.260 --> 30:01.219
is that I'm going to take
everything that I've learned

30:01.260 --> 30:04.628
from my maker and from
those that I've made,

30:04.670 --> 30:09.164
both bad and good,
to protect you.

30:09.200 --> 30:13.034
As long as I am alive,
I will keep you safe.

30:15.110 --> 30:16.373
- OK.

30:32.860 --> 30:34.419
(Sighs)

31:01.960 --> 31:04.349
- Nothing quite like
a vampire stripper

31:04.390 --> 31:06.085
to put things in perspective.

31:11.230 --> 31:13.062
I'm sorry about earlier...

31:14.840 --> 31:18.060
for even thinking that you would
side with them over us.

31:18.110 --> 31:20.829
- No, I, uh...
I get it.

31:20.870 --> 31:25.501
You and Nora are about to start
your own, let's face it, pack.

31:25.550 --> 31:26.676
You get protective
of your own.

31:26.710 --> 31:28.018
- I never should have blamed you

31:28.050 --> 31:30.314
for what the other vampires
did to Pete.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.326
- Pete was a good guy.
I know that he helped you.

31:39.360 --> 31:42.295
- And he proved that the curse
doesn't have to define us.

31:43.900 --> 31:47.461
Even if I can't control my wolf,
it doesn't have to ruin me.

31:47.500 --> 31:48.865
- Curse or no curse,

31:48.900 --> 31:52.962
we can still choose
who we wanna be.

31:53.010 --> 31:55.536
- Look at us. Evolved.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.208
(Laughing)

31:59.810 --> 32:03.713
Kenny's lucky to have you
as his papa.

32:05.850 --> 32:08.717
- (Aidan): Sally? Nora--
- (Sally): Come in, come in!

32:08.760 --> 32:11.388
- Hey, Nora told me
you wanted to see me.

32:11.430 --> 32:12.682
- Yeah, come in.

32:19.070 --> 32:20.822
The hunger's
getting too strong.

32:20.870 --> 32:22.395
I don't wanna
hurt anybody else.

32:22.440 --> 32:26.070
Josh and Nora won't do it,
so I need you to promise me,

32:26.110 --> 32:29.171
when the time comes,
you're gonna kill me.

32:29.210 --> 32:31.076
- That was really good.
You been working on that?

32:31.110 --> 32:32.077
- Aidan, I'm serious.

32:32.110 --> 32:33.908
- No! You can't give up.

32:33.950 --> 32:36.544
Josh and Nora, they just
found that psychic, Ilana.

32:36.580 --> 32:38.241
Maybe she can help with Donna.

32:38.290 --> 32:41.009
- You think she'll answer
the door when I look like this?

32:41.060 --> 32:43.119
- Well, then let me help!
- How?

32:45.130 --> 32:46.882
How are you gonna help me?

32:50.560 --> 32:53.689
- Oh, dammit! OK!

32:54.740 --> 32:57.698
Listen to me, uh...

32:57.740 --> 33:01.199
Josh, he saved me
when I needed it.

33:01.240 --> 33:04.904
And he can't help you now,
but I can.

33:06.110 --> 33:07.703
- What are you doing?

33:07.750 --> 33:09.445
- Eat me.

33:10.620 --> 33:12.714
No, eat!

33:12.750 --> 33:13.888
Eat.

33:13.920 --> 33:15.888
- Aidan, I'm not
gonna eat you.

33:15.920 --> 33:17.410
- Oh, come on,
I'm gonna heal.

33:17.460 --> 33:18.950
- How? By eating
somebody else?

33:18.990 --> 33:21.789
- No! Security at the hospital
has loosened up.

33:21.830 --> 33:23.719
I've got plenty of blood, so...

33:29.300 --> 33:30.597
It's OK.

33:32.770 --> 33:34.602
- It's like biting
through a tire.

33:34.640 --> 33:35.732
- Sorry.

33:37.610 --> 33:39.578
- Can you, like,
stop flexing?

33:39.610 --> 33:40.907
- I'm sorry!
I'm nervous.

33:42.320 --> 33:43.719
Oh, that's not too--

33:43.750 --> 33:44.979
(Cries out)

33:47.990 --> 33:49.913
- Ilana...
- Can I help you?

33:51.190 --> 33:52.988
Oh! Are you OK?

33:53.030 --> 33:55.749
- Oh God, of course,
you don't recognize me.

33:55.800 --> 33:57.950
- Have we met?

33:58.000 --> 33:59.320
- Just that time
I possessed you

33:59.370 --> 34:02.761
to stop you and my murderous
fianc from exorcising me.

34:02.800 --> 34:07.636
- Sally. I guess
your friends found Donna.

34:17.650 --> 34:20.119
She brought you
all the way back.

34:20.150 --> 34:21.788
- Yeah, and now
I'm about to die

34:21.820 --> 34:24.187
and I kind of promised
Donna my soul.

34:24.230 --> 34:25.527
- That's why
I told your friends

34:25.560 --> 34:27.858
I didn't want anything
to do with her.

34:27.889 --> 34:29.654
- You can't wash
your hands of this.

34:29.699 --> 34:32.795
Please. At least tell me
where to find her.

34:37.199 --> 34:39.339
- Look...

34:39.370 --> 34:42.829
even if I knew, I would
advise you to just stay away.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.541
- And what?

34:44.580 --> 34:46.708
I just wait around for her
creepy ass door to show up?

34:46.750 --> 34:48.377
- What do you mean "her" door?

34:48.420 --> 34:51.047
- I brought 2 people back
with me from limbo.

34:51.080 --> 34:53.742
And when they died,
they both got the same door.

34:53.790 --> 34:55.315
(Scoffs)

34:55.360 --> 34:57.010
- That's impossible.

34:57.060 --> 35:00.519
I mean, from what I understand,
a door is your portal.

35:00.560 --> 35:04.190
If the same door is appearing
to several different people,

35:04.230 --> 35:06.369
it's not leading
to the next world.

35:06.400 --> 35:08.698
It's leading to somewhere
in this world,

35:08.740 --> 35:10.697
somewhere Donna
wants you to go.

35:10.740 --> 35:13.232
- Well, yeah, that I get.
She owns my soul.

35:13.270 --> 35:15.034
But why my friends?

35:15.080 --> 35:16.707
- No, it isn't right.

35:16.740 --> 35:18.947
- Can [...
Can I ignore it?

35:18.980 --> 35:20.903
Can I just live
as a ghost?

35:20.950 --> 35:22.577
- No. She'll know
you're on to her.

35:22.620 --> 35:25.419
Donna wouldn't make a door
you could avoid.

35:25.450 --> 35:28.215
But if you go through the door,
and you are ready for her,

35:28.260 --> 35:29.580
you might have a chance.

35:29.620 --> 35:31.429
- Me against Donna?

35:31.460 --> 35:33.383
This woman makes
buildings disappear.

35:33.430 --> 35:35.421
How do I have any chance
against her?

35:35.460 --> 35:38.862
- Don't underestimate yourself.
You are incredibly powerful.

35:38.900 --> 35:41.062
- Do you mean
Harry Potter powerful

35:41.100 --> 35:43.967
or "you want to make me feel
good about myself" powerful?

35:44.000 --> 35:45.764
- You survived an exorcism.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.460
You made it back
from the dead.

35:47.510 --> 35:50.571
You rescued 2 other souls
and brought them back with you.

35:50.610 --> 35:53.079
I never knew you your
first time on this plane,

35:53.110 --> 35:55.477
but it seems you're
a much different spirit now.

35:55.520 --> 35:57.477
- Yeah...

35:58.490 --> 35:59.912
(Sighs)

36:01.790 --> 36:03.110
How do I get ready?

36:03.160 --> 36:05.254
- Before you become
a ghost again,

36:05.290 --> 36:06.951
resolve any issues
you have in this life.

36:06.990 --> 36:09.960
You don't wanna be weighed down
like you were the first time.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.968
- What do I do when
I actually see Donna?

36:12.000 --> 36:13.820
- You take the power
away from her.

36:13.870 --> 36:15.998
- Love the sentiment.
Need some specifics.

36:16.040 --> 36:17.860
- OK, um...

36:17.900 --> 36:21.803
This is not exactly
my area of expertise,

36:21.840 --> 36:23.535
but...

36:27.710 --> 36:29.018
(Sighs)

36:29.050 --> 36:30.518
How's your Latin?

36:47.400 --> 36:50.165
- So let's cut to the chase.

36:50.200 --> 36:53.500
Is this gonna be
state or federal?

36:53.540 --> 36:55.235
- What?

36:55.280 --> 36:58.341
- Well, every time you drop by
out of the blue like this,

36:58.380 --> 37:02.374
usually it's followed by
some sort of criminal request.

37:02.420 --> 37:04.548
Just trying to plan
my jail time accordingly.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.740
What am I looking at?

37:06.790 --> 37:09.589
- I didn't come here
to ask for anything.

37:09.620 --> 37:11.782
I'm here to say goodbye...

37:12.790 --> 37:14.258
for good.

37:17.930 --> 37:21.560
- I'm sorry.
You know, I, um...

37:21.600 --> 37:23.591
I really wanted to help.

37:24.710 --> 37:26.530
I really wanted this
to work out.

37:26.570 --> 37:29.699
- Well, listen,
had you been more accepting

37:29.740 --> 37:33.870
of my rotting body and my
witness-protection lifestyle,

37:33.910 --> 37:37.210
I mean, we could've
had something real great.

37:37.250 --> 37:38.581
I don't know.

37:38.620 --> 37:40.384
- I mean, I tried.

37:40.420 --> 37:44.084
- I'm joking. Nervously.

37:44.120 --> 37:48.057
The fact that you actually
did try to make this work

37:48.090 --> 37:50.320
says everything about you.

37:51.570 --> 37:53.220
You're everything
I wish I could have had

37:53.270 --> 37:54.999
when I was truly alive.

38:02.180 --> 38:07.107
* The burning of
the solemn fire *

38:08.620 --> 38:11.612
* I could not speak

38:11.650 --> 38:15.280
* For my own state of mind...

38:16.320 --> 38:17.856
- You look better.

38:20.160 --> 38:21.992
Do I wanna know why?

38:23.330 --> 38:25.469
- Probably not.
- Hmm...

38:25.500 --> 38:28.128
* To know

38:28.170 --> 38:31.037
* That your pain is mine *

38:33.170 --> 38:34.831
(Groans)

38:37.010 --> 38:38.705
(Sighs)

38:53.360 --> 38:54.850
(Sighs)

39:05.570 --> 39:07.038
- What do you want?

39:08.740 --> 39:10.674
(Groaning)

39:10.710 --> 39:12.371
- You.

39:18.250 --> 39:21.220
- I'm so hungry.

39:26.260 --> 39:28.058
- What the hell are you?

39:31.770 --> 39:33.761
(Coughing)

39:49.120 --> 39:50.372
(Aidan screams)

39:59.930 --> 40:03.093
- Why did you do this to me?

40:06.930 --> 40:09.137
(Breathing heavily)

40:11.270 --> 40:12.931
<i>Jeff Weston.
Nice 10 meet you.</i>

40:17.780 --> 40:20.806
- It was a lot to take.
Emily will come around.

40:20.850 --> 40:22.579
- You don't know her
like I do.

40:22.620 --> 40:25.920
She's surprisingly stubborn
for a slacker.

40:27.320 --> 40:32.156
- So our small wedding
just got a little smaller.

40:33.630 --> 40:36.793
- This is so far from the
wedding I wanted to give you.

40:38.470 --> 40:42.964
It's not the way I wanted
to start our life together.

40:44.540 --> 40:46.338
- It's OK.

40:46.370 --> 40:49.305
- Is it?
Objectively speaking?

40:49.340 --> 40:53.277
I mean, my sister hates me.
Liam wants us dead.

40:53.310 --> 40:55.950
And if I learned anything
from Sadie the stripper,

40:55.980 --> 40:58.347
it's that Aidan's
strongly worded warning

40:58.380 --> 41:00.189
may not carry
that much weight.

41:00.220 --> 41:03.155
- All I need for the
perfect wedding is you.

41:09.560 --> 41:12.461
Just don't let Sally eat me
before we say "I do."

41:12.500 --> 41:13.820
- Mmm...

41:31.890 --> 41:34.712
- Why did you do this to me?

41:34.760 --> 41:37.559
* You don't

41:38.160 --> 41:42.358
* Need a reason

41:43.800 --> 41:47.521
* For I know that

41:47.570 --> 41:51.359
* What I've done is wrong...

41:51.400 --> 41:53.061
- Hello?

41:54.070 --> 41:56.903
* Yeah it's the same

41:58.310 --> 42:02.372
* Right or wrong

42:04.590 --> 42:08.914
* Yeah it's the same thing

42:09.960 --> 42:13.089
* Right or wrong...

42:14.130 --> 42:15.450
(Gasps)

42:16.460 --> 42:18.792
Please let me go.

42:18.830 --> 42:20.821
- What did you tell the girl?
- Nothing.

42:20.870 --> 42:22.167
- Donna thinks otherwise.

42:22.200 --> 42:23.998
- Donna has taken
so much already.

42:24.040 --> 42:25.508
Just leave the girl alone!

42:27.040 --> 42:30.237
Whatever spirit possesses
this man, I banish you--

42:30.280 --> 42:32.203
(Bones cracking, thud)

42:33.250 --> 42:35.014
(Scoffs)

42:35.050 --> 42:37.371
- You picked
the losing side, lady.

42:37.620 --> 42:41.887
* And both sides are even

42:47.560 --> 42:50.393
* They are even

42:52.070 --> 42:54.869
* And alone *
