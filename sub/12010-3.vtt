The bin on your left is
kitchen waste.

00:27.320 --> 00:30.800
That's old fruit, veg, bones, etc.
Kitchen waste.

00:30.840 --> 00:34.520
The bin in the middle, that's your
everyday household products. Right.

00:34.560 --> 00:37.840
That's your pottery shards,
your sackcloth, papyrus and whatnot.

00:37.880 --> 00:41.360
Household products, yeah. Bin
on your right, that's miscellaneous.

00:41.400 --> 00:44.160
Miscellaneous. What's that?
Well, any other bollocks.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.000
Got it?
Yep. Sorted.

00:48.040 --> 00:52.560
Fruit on the right, bones
in the middle, bollocks on the left.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.880
Hang on.

00:54.920 --> 00:58.040
Bones on the right, pots
in the middle, whatnot on the...

00:59.040 --> 01:01.080
Fuck it.

01:18.040 --> 01:20.040
Miscellaneous.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.280
Come see my show. I'm in a show.

01:37.320 --> 01:39.240
Come to my show.

01:39.280 --> 01:42.400
Hey, guys. Wanna come to my show?
It's my Roman de-boo.

01:42.440 --> 01:44.160
Oh, wow. That's brilliant.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.480
It's a one-woman play
about the siege of Troy

01:46.520 --> 01:48.800
told from the perspective of
the Trojan horse.

01:48.840 --> 01:51.360
Yeah, yeah, that's brilliant.
How long is it, please?

01:51.400 --> 01:54.200
Two hours, no interval.
Plus a Q and A afterwards.

01:54.240 --> 01:57.400
You'll come, right?
I... of course.

01:57.440 --> 02:00.160
That sounds amazing.
I really can't wait.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.080
OK. How about you?

02:02.120 --> 02:04.400
While I'd love to support you
on your 'de-boo',

02:04.440 --> 02:06.360
I'm actually too stupid for theatre.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.080
I'm more into sport and sex.

02:09.120 --> 02:13.880
Of course.
It is quite a challenging piece.

02:16.240 --> 02:18.240
You are a very bad liar, by the way.

02:18.280 --> 02:20.080
I think I got away with it though.

02:20.120 --> 02:23.280
Yeah, just. But what happens once
you've actually seen the show?

02:23.320 --> 02:25.320
What do you say to her then?
I just say...

02:25.360 --> 02:27.800
"Loved the play, Cynth.
That was powerful stuff."

02:27.840 --> 02:29.720
No, see, you sound sarcastic.

02:29.760 --> 02:31.640
That's just my normal voice.
Try again.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.520
OK, don't cough.

02:33.560 --> 02:36.640
You were sensational. And don't go
too far. She'll smell a rat.

02:36.680 --> 02:39.440
So... um... "What a great play."

02:39.480 --> 02:41.920
Yeah, you can't go.
It's too risky.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.880
Spoon.

02:44.920 --> 02:47.760
Spoon.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.480
Spoon.

02:52.320 --> 02:54.160
Spoon.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.760
Spoo-
What have you got there?

02:56.800 --> 02:59.520
A spoon.
Yeah, under the spoon.

02:59.560 --> 03:02.520
A baby.
And what's it doing in our flat?

03:02.560 --> 03:04.240
It's just sort of gurgling.

03:04.280 --> 03:06.160
Aw, it's well cute.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.200
I know. I found it in the bins.

03:08.240 --> 03:10.520
Oh, I finally took the rubbish out
like you said.

03:10.560 --> 03:13.720
Fantastic. That task also involved
not coming back with a baby.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.960
Well, I couldn't just
leave it there, could I?

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
Right, did anyone see you take it?
Don't think so, why?

03:19.040 --> 03:21.280
I want you to put it back.
What? No chance.

03:21.320 --> 03:24.560
You can't put it back once you've
touched it. That's basically a rule.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.320
For canapes, yeah. Not for babies.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.040
It's not going back to the bins.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.360
Take it to a shelter then.
Why? I can look after it.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.520
Grumio, you can barely look after
yourself.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.400
Look what happened to your
basil plant.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.680
That plant were too thirsty.
I couldn't keep up.

03:36.720 --> 03:39.600
Hence why you cannot keep a baby.
Your parents kept me.

03:39.640 --> 03:42.840
That's different.
They were grown-ups. And 50% woman.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.920
Oh, so if it were you
who found me on that hill

03:44.960 --> 03:46.640
you'd have just put me back, then?

03:46.680 --> 03:49.800
No, I just wouldn't have picked you
up in the first place. Tell him.

03:49.840 --> 03:52.280
Maybe we should keep it.
Nice one.

03:52.320 --> 03:54.000
What are we going to do with a baby?

03:54.040 --> 03:56.040
Take it for walks, to cafes.

03:56.080 --> 03:59.080
Oh, no, no. You want it as some
sort of pulling device, don't you?

03:59.120 --> 04:01.880
Already got a shit hot
pulling device right here, mate.

04:01.920 --> 04:03.680
But another one can't hurt.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.400
I say we vote on it.
No, no, no, no.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.240
This is not a voting situation.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.840
All those in favour of
putting it back in the bin?

04:10.880 --> 04:12.880
All those in favour of keeping it?

04:14.080 --> 04:15.800
Boom.
OK. Fine.

04:15.840 --> 04:18.000
You'll get bored of this in
a few days, anyway.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.320
While it is here,
I'm having nothing to do with it.

04:20.360 --> 04:23.160
It is your responsibility,
and you can start by changing it.

04:23.200 --> 04:26.120
It fucking reeks.
Don't swear in front of my baby!

04:28.440 --> 04:30.200
Tear me off a leaf.

04:30.240 --> 04:31.960
Are you sure a cabbage
is gonna work?

04:32.000 --> 04:34.160
Course. It's nature's nappy.

04:37.560 --> 04:40.480
That's quite a pong for a little...
girl.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.160
What are we gonna call her?
Binny.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.640
Binny, really?
Cos I found her in the bins.

04:46.680 --> 04:50.080
And you're sure that's a name? You
can call a kid anything these days.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.640
Plus, I don't want her to forget
where she came from.

04:52.680 --> 04:56.400
Binny it is. You can take it
from here, right? Yeah.

04:58.160 --> 05:01.360
# Binny, I found you in the rubbish

05:01.400 --> 05:04.240
# But you are not rubbish

05:04.280 --> 05:07.320
# In fact you're really ace

05:07.360 --> 05:11.880
# Oh, Binny,
you've got to go to sleep now

05:11.920 --> 05:14.840
# I need to go to sleep now

05:14.880 --> 05:17.880
* Please just shut your face *

05:17.920 --> 05:21.520
That is the last time I
let you take the rubbish out, Grumio.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.240
Suits me.

05:23.280 --> 05:25.440
Eh up. I think she wants
some brekkie.

05:25.480 --> 05:28.840
Where serves a nice drop of milk
round here?

05:28.880 --> 05:32.040
Just slide her under the chassis
there and wait for her to clamp on.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.120
Will do. Here goes.

05:34.160 --> 05:37.200
She kept me up half the night
with her non-stop caterwauling.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.000
Sorry. She won't be with us long.

05:39.040 --> 05:42.760
This is a big week for me.
I'm making my de-boo as an actress.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.920
And she's making her 'de-boo'
as a person.

05:44.960 --> 05:46.640
You're still coming, right?

05:47.640 --> 05:50.920
Yeah. Of course.
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.600
Aaaaand...

05:55.640 --> 05:57.360
She's on!

05:57.400 --> 06:01.600
Oh, look at her go. Lovely.
Hungry little bugger, isn't she, eh?

06:01.640 --> 06:03.360
Bit weird, this.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.400
It's all part of a noble tradition.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.840
The founders of our city
used to suck on a wolf.

06:07.880 --> 06:10.880
Never did them any harm. Yeah,
and it's cheaper than a wet nurse.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.760
Did you just say 'wet nurse'?

06:12.800 --> 06:15.520
Yeah, wet nurses. They hang out
down at the spice market.

06:15.560 --> 06:17.400
Why are they wet?
What's wet about them?

06:17.440 --> 06:19.440
I guess the... um... the norks.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.720
We should get a wet nurse, Grumio.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.720
Let's go and get a wet nurse
right now.

06:25.920 --> 06:27.840
This is amazing.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.880
We should have got a baby ages ago.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.840
So which one do you fancy?

06:31.880 --> 06:34.840
Um... maybe one of them mothery ones
sitting down over there.

06:34.880 --> 06:36.560
The blonde, exactly.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.960
What? No! Someone with experience.
A safe pair of boobs.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.800
They'll be old boobs, Grumio.

06:41.840 --> 06:44.800
Our baby doesn't want old milk
oozing out like yoghurt.

06:44.840 --> 06:47.680
She wants milk that's fresh
and creamy and...

06:47.720 --> 06:49.560
fit.

06:53.160 --> 06:55.920
Hello.
Hey. And who's this cutie?

06:55.960 --> 06:59.120
I'm Stylax. Hi. But this is Binny.

06:59.160 --> 07:00.960
Aww. Unusual name.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.240
I found her in the bins.
The bins? That is horrific.

07:04.280 --> 07:06.160
It's fine. We gave her a rinse.

07:06.200 --> 07:09.600
Well, here's some information on
your legal rights as new parents.

07:09.640 --> 07:11.720
Oh... we're not couple.

07:11.760 --> 07:14.320
I'm straight, and even if I was gay,
I mean, come on.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.080
I could do better than that.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.800
He could, yeah.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.440
And now baby needs a nurse?
A wet one, yes.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.400
Well, breast is best.
Yeah.

07:22.440 --> 07:24.520
As well as providing
all the key nutrients,

07:24.560 --> 07:26.720
it helps protect against illness -
Hey. Hey.

07:26.760 --> 07:28.760
You had me at 'breast'.

07:35.960 --> 07:39.440
"All employers are legally obliged
to offer new fathers

07:39.480 --> 07:41.720
two weeks paid paternity leave."

07:41.760 --> 07:45.160
And that's not me saying that,
sweetheart. That is city hall.

07:45.200 --> 07:49.200
So that creature's yours, is it?
Big time.

07:49.240 --> 07:52.640
Because it's rather pale, Shredder.
Whereas you're somewhat darker.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.720
Yeah, she looks more like
her mother.

07:54.760 --> 07:57.000
And who is the mother?
We don't know.

07:57.040 --> 07:58.720
It could be one of
a number of women.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.440
Right.

08:01.520 --> 08:04.440
No, no, no. Make that stop.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.280
Uh... yeah.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.000
Do-do. Do-do.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.280
I don't know how. Could you?

08:10.320 --> 08:13.320
I might have something knocking
about. In fact...

08:13.360 --> 08:15.360
Here you are.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.880
Is that a dummy?
Could be.

08:18.920 --> 08:20.600
Unless it's a bummy.

08:20.640 --> 08:22.560
A what, sorry?
A bummy. A bum dummy.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.360
Do you mean a butt plug?

08:24.400 --> 08:28.240
It's either a baby's dummy
or an adult's bummy.

08:28.280 --> 08:31.240
How can I tell which it is?
Maybe... suck it and see?

08:31.280 --> 08:33.280
I think I'll leave it.

08:33.320 --> 08:35.000
So, see you in two weeks, then?

08:35.039 --> 08:38.080
Very well, Shredder.
You may have your leave. Thank you.

08:38.120 --> 08:41.679
I've been wanting to shake things up
in your department for some time.

08:41.720 --> 08:44.159
You've just give me
the perfect excuse.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.160
Right.

08:49.080 --> 08:52.080
For the next two weeks,
Shredder's document disposal

08:52.120 --> 08:56.360
will be performed by
your new colleague, Burner.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.240
We're working with a barbecue?

08:58.280 --> 09:00.480
It's a state-of-the-art
office appliance.

09:00.520 --> 09:02.320
We need to modernise to economise.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.160
It is quite hot though.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.120
That's the thing about fires,
Copier - hot is how they come.

09:07.160 --> 09:09.000
Well, I think
it's a huge improvement.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.640
We'll finally get some work done
around here. I know!

09:11.680 --> 09:14.400
Look how efficient he is.
No, no! Ah.

09:14.440 --> 09:16.520
Oh, wow! That's really impressive.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.480
I was actually working on those.

09:18.520 --> 09:21.280
Oh, it's his first day,
he's bound to make mistakes.

09:21.320 --> 09:24.280
Now, play nicely!

09:28.240 --> 09:30.640
Now, you're sure you're comfortable?

09:30.680 --> 09:33.000
If baby's comfortable
then I'm comfortable.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.120
Can I get you another pillow
or open a window?

09:35.160 --> 09:39.960
I'm perfect, thank you.
Yeah? OK. I'll just sit and watch.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.960
The baby.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.640
Salve, dickheads.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.840
Hey, man. Grab a seat.
It's feeding time.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.600
What's going on?

09:49.640 --> 09:51.840
Marcus, this is Philippa.
Our wet nurse.

09:51.880 --> 09:54.280
Philippa, this is Marcus,
daddy number three.

09:54.320 --> 09:57.200
I'm not a daddy, I just live here.
How much is this costing?

09:57.240 --> 09:59.520
Dude, never mind that.
20 denarii a feed. What?

09:59.560 --> 10:01.360
That's double what the goat charged!

10:01.400 --> 10:04.640
Goat's milk is absolutely fine,
if your child is a goat.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.520
But it's fattier than breast milk,

10:06.560 --> 10:09.520
And stray hairs can stick in
baby's throat. There you go.

10:09.560 --> 10:12.360
When it comes to nursing,
you really get what you pay for.

10:12.400 --> 10:15.880
Nursing? Spurting out bodily fluids
counts as nursing now, does it?

10:15.920 --> 10:18.920
Woah! Steady on, man.
It's a branch of nursing, yes.

10:18.960 --> 10:21.640
So maybe I'll go to the bogs
and nurse out some piss.

10:21.680 --> 10:24.400
Is that a branch of nursing?
No, it's not.

10:24.440 --> 10:27.600
What's got up your arse, then?
This has, Grumio! This bollocks.

10:27.640 --> 10:30.000
I'm stuck at work between Aurelius
and a cauldron

10:30.040 --> 10:32.280
while you two fart around
looking at boobs.

10:32.320 --> 10:34.960
Firstly, we are not farting around.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.840
We are nurturing an innocent child.

10:36.880 --> 10:40.440
Secondly, we are not
looking at boobs, plural,

10:40.480 --> 10:43.240
because Philippa here
only gets one out at a time.

10:43.280 --> 10:45.720
Look, I know you're tired
and stressed,

10:45.760 --> 10:48.960
but please don't take it out on
this highly talented woman

10:49.000 --> 10:51.600
who is performing
nature's greatest miracle.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.860
Thank you for valuing my work.

10:56.942 --> 10:59.422
Hey, thank you
for doing what you do.

11:05.742 --> 11:08.782
Go and get her then.
You go. I went last time.

11:08.822 --> 11:11.702
No, she's your baby.
Stylax!

11:11.742 --> 11:14.302
No, thanks.
Why not?

11:14.342 --> 11:16.062
Don't want to.

11:16.102 --> 11:18.862
Please, Marcus. I'm so cosy.

11:18.902 --> 11:22.022
If I get her, Grumio,
I'm taking her to the shelter.

11:22.062 --> 11:25.582
Chuffing Nora, all right then!

11:26.942 --> 11:31.022
* Binny,
I found you in the rubbish *

11:32.582 --> 11:35.102
Come on, Binny.
You're doing my head in, love.

11:40.122 --> 11:41.962
I can't stay awake.

11:42.002 --> 11:44.962
It's not healthy to live with a baby
and work with a fire.

11:45.002 --> 11:47.162
It is warm. I'll give you that.

11:47.202 --> 11:49.802
She's literally turned this place
into a sweat shop.

11:49.842 --> 11:52.962
I hate to say this, but I think
I prefer Stylax to that hot prick.

11:53.002 --> 11:55.242
Morning, morning.
How are we all getting on?

11:55.282 --> 11:56.962
Like a house on fire.
Good, good.

11:57.002 --> 11:58.682
As in, it's unbearably hot.

11:58.722 --> 12:01.922
Well, you know what they say. If
you can't stand the heat, fuck off.

12:01.962 --> 12:05.882
Right. May I apologise for
the high salt content of the water?

12:05.922 --> 12:08.242
Some perspiration might have
infused.

12:08.282 --> 12:10.282
That is thoroughly vile, water boy.

12:10.322 --> 12:12.882
Sorry. Water man. It's just
the conditions in here are

12:12.922 --> 12:15.002
a smidge inhuman.
Are they now?

12:15.042 --> 12:18.682
Well, what a human can't handle,
we can always leave to appliances.

12:18.722 --> 12:21.042
I doubt you'll find anything
that can do my job.

12:21.082 --> 12:24.002
What about a table?
That would do, wouldn't it?

12:31.322 --> 12:33.322
This is my kind of office.

12:33.362 --> 12:35.162
Is there any way I could do this?

12:35.202 --> 12:38.162
Do you get male wet nurses?
And how might that work exactly?

12:38.202 --> 12:39.922
I dunno, as a sort of middle man?

12:39.962 --> 12:41.962
To get the milk going?

12:42.002 --> 12:44.962
Lactation's usually triggered by
feeding or crying.

12:45.002 --> 12:47.322
Or occasionally sexual arousal.

12:47.362 --> 12:50.402
And what could trigger that?

12:50.442 --> 12:53.882
Did you come to book me again
or just ask me daft questions?

12:53.922 --> 12:56.042
I have one more daft question.

12:56.082 --> 12:58.202
Go on.
Do you fancy a drink?

12:58.242 --> 13:00.522
I mean, I figure
you're always serving them,

13:00.562 --> 13:02.362
so maybe you'd want one yourself.

13:11.242 --> 13:12.962
Oh, yeah!
Yeah?

13:15.002 --> 13:18.882
Yeah! Yeah?
Yeah!

13:26.442 --> 13:28.442
Yeah! Yeah!

13:34.042 --> 13:35.762
I don't like it! I don't like it!

13:39.922 --> 13:42.082
Argh! Argh!

13:43.402 --> 13:46.722
It's harder than it looks, you know.
Don't know how my parents did it.

13:46.762 --> 13:50.202
I thought your parents decided not to
do it and left you on top of a hill?

13:50.242 --> 13:53.362
And I'm beginning to see why.
They were very wise, my parents.

13:53.402 --> 13:55.882
Just wish she'd start sleeping
and stop crying.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.682
Maybe it's a phase.

13:57.722 --> 13:59.962
Yeah, she'll soon be out of it.
I hope so.

14:00.002 --> 14:03.162
And into something worse.
Worse? What do you mean?

14:03.202 --> 14:06.282
Well, next up's the tearing about
and smashing things up phase.

14:06.322 --> 14:08.962
And then the copping off with
greasy toe rags phase.

14:09.002 --> 14:10.802
Not under my roof she won't.

14:10.842 --> 14:12.962
And then finally
sticking you in the ground

14:13.002 --> 14:16.602
and selling all your stuff phase.
I'd enjoy this bit if I were you.

14:21.682 --> 14:24.802
What, she hosed you down?
She hosed me down good.

14:24.842 --> 14:27.922
It got everywhere, man.
In my hair, up my nose, in my mouth.

14:27.962 --> 14:29.762
Did you spit or...?

14:29.802 --> 14:31.482
I swallowed.
Eurgh!

14:31.522 --> 14:33.242
What? I didn't want to be rude,
did I?

14:33.282 --> 14:36.722
Can't see here again though. Not
after the hosing. I feel humiliated.

14:36.762 --> 14:38.602
So the goat's back in business?
Nah.

14:38.642 --> 14:42.002
Actually, we've decided to knock the
whole paternity thing on the head.

14:42.042 --> 14:45.042
Grumio's taking Binny
to the shelter. The shelter? Yes!

14:45.082 --> 14:47.962
And I'm gonna get my job back.
I wouldn't rely on it, mate.

14:48.002 --> 14:50.562
What's up with him?
He's being replaced by a table.

14:50.602 --> 14:53.962
Are you serious? The machines are
taking over. None of us are safe.

14:54.002 --> 14:55.842
Oh, as if.
Flavia would never let you go.

14:55.882 --> 14:57.562
You're part of the furniture.

14:57.602 --> 15:00.002
I don't think so.
Not compared to actual furniture.

15:00.042 --> 15:04.242
I mean look at that.
Upright, sturdy, mahogany.

15:04.282 --> 15:07.882
It's everything I could never be.

15:07.922 --> 15:09.762
Oh, goodbye.

15:09.802 --> 15:11.842
Oh, thank you. Goodbye, fans.

15:11.882 --> 15:15.002
Thank you. Do come back and visit.
Bless you.

15:15.042 --> 15:18.802
Oh, hold on, you. You, you can stay.
I'll find something else for you.

15:18.842 --> 15:21.122
Shredder, darling!
Where are the fans going?

15:21.171 --> 15:24.651
I'm letting them go. I've decided to
replace them with windows.

15:24.691 --> 15:27.531
Oh, but the fans are great.
I'm a fan of the fans.

15:27.571 --> 15:30.651
As am I. But we mustn't stand
in the way of progress, must we?

15:30.691 --> 15:32.771
Like you, they've become obsolete.

15:32.811 --> 15:36.331
What do you mean, 'like me'?
Burner has been a roaring success.

15:36.371 --> 15:39.891
He's cheap, he's efficient,
and he probably won't have babies.

15:39.931 --> 15:41.691
No, no. That was my last baby.
Promise.

15:41.731 --> 15:44.411
Yeah, that's what they all say.

15:44.451 --> 15:47.091
What is that rancid smell?

15:47.131 --> 15:50.211
It's breast milk. I got milked on.
I've tried to wring it out,

15:50.251 --> 15:52.891
but I think there's still
a fair bit in my hair. Right.

15:52.931 --> 15:55.691
I don't claim to know much about
parenting, Shredder,

15:55.731 --> 15:57.731
but I suspect you're doing it wrong.

15:58.971 --> 16:01.251
Now, what shall we do with you?

16:01.291 --> 16:05.971
Maybe we could use you as
an accountant, or a... paperweight?

16:12.291 --> 16:15.811
So, she likes singing,
but she doesn't like tickling.

16:15.851 --> 16:18.771
And she likes being rocked
when she's burpy,

16:18.811 --> 16:20.851
and she loves it
if you blow on her tummy.

16:20.891 --> 16:24.171
Yeah, cool, got it. Tickle the tummy.
Yeah, kids love that. What? No.

16:24.211 --> 16:26.331
Just a sec. Oi, is that a mace?

16:26.371 --> 16:28.611
Why has that kid got a mace in here?

16:28.651 --> 16:31.091
We're a bit stretched at the mo.

16:31.131 --> 16:34.931
Yeah, just bung her on any free
surface. I'll find her a bunk later.

16:34.971 --> 16:39.651
Why has he still got that mace?
That is a weapon of war!

16:39.691 --> 16:41.611
Sorry.

16:41.651 --> 16:43.491
Can I just ask...?
Shoot.

16:43.531 --> 16:46.251
Where do these kids, like, end up?

16:46.291 --> 16:48.291
Well, wherever they want, in theory.

16:48.331 --> 16:51.291
Could be the senate, the arena.

16:51.331 --> 16:54.251
I mean, most of them do end up
down a mine or in a brothel,

16:54.291 --> 16:56.291
but, you know, we do what we can.

16:56.331 --> 16:58.451
There you go, stick her in there.
Look.

17:00.251 --> 17:02.091
Her name's Binny, by the way.

17:02.131 --> 17:03.811
Yeah, you too, mate.

17:03.851 --> 17:05.851
Take that out of your mouth now!

17:27.851 --> 17:30.891
Marcus?
Hey, you two.

17:30.931 --> 17:32.731
How's it going?

17:32.771 --> 17:35.011
So-so.
Just picked up the reviews.

17:35.051 --> 17:37.051
Oh, yeah?
Anything about your 'de-boo'?

17:37.091 --> 17:39.691
There's one vile hack who says that
I'm perfect casting

17:39.731 --> 17:42.091
for a wooden horse because...
well, you can guess.

17:42.131 --> 17:44.291
Mmm. Cos you're horsey?
Because I'm wooden.

17:44.331 --> 17:46.371
Wooden, yes.
What do you mean I'm horsey?

17:46.411 --> 17:48.491
How about the others?
Are they any better?

17:48.531 --> 17:50.251
This one just says "horse shit".

17:50.291 --> 17:53.451
Oh. Ah. I'm outraged.
That is so unfair.

17:53.491 --> 17:55.331
How would you know?
You haven't seen it.

17:55.371 --> 17:57.171
No, I know. I'm sorry.
I've had a lot on.

17:57.211 --> 17:59.931
And I've not been sleeping.
And there's a fire in my office.

17:59.971 --> 18:02.371
If you don't want to see it, Marcus,
you can just say.

18:02.411 --> 18:06.211
No, I am desperate to come.
I adore challenging and long theatre.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.811
Right, then you can have my ticket
for tomorrow night.

18:08.851 --> 18:11.971
Tomorrow? Cos I've already seen it.
Three times. Honestly, don't -

18:12.011 --> 18:14.331
And as you're desperate...

18:14.371 --> 18:16.131
Well, thank you, Metella.

18:16.171 --> 18:20.611
Super. We'll grab a drink afterwards
and you can give me a nicer review.

18:20.651 --> 18:22.531
OK. Great.

18:25.131 --> 18:28.851
It's so nice to finally have
some silence around here.

18:28.891 --> 18:30.851
Shh! Binny's asleep.

18:30.891 --> 18:33.171
Why is she still here? Shh!
Why is she still here?!

18:33.211 --> 18:36.491
You were meant to take her to the
shelter. I couldn't. It were dirty.

18:36.531 --> 18:39.251
So? This flat's dirty. You're dirty.

18:39.291 --> 18:42.251
And if she stayed there she'd end up
as a prossie. Or a miner.

18:42.291 --> 18:44.651
Or maybe both.
Yeah, but...

18:44.691 --> 18:47.451
what's the alternative?
You're looking at it.

18:47.491 --> 18:51.211
Oh, no. Come on. No way. We're not
seriously keeping her. That's crazy.

18:51.251 --> 18:53.411
Tell him.
I dunno, man.

18:53.451 --> 18:55.571
She'll ruin our lives!

18:55.611 --> 18:58.531
This isn't about us, though.
It's about her.

18:58.571 --> 19:01.131
Binny needs a home.

19:01.171 --> 19:04.331
Just like I needed home
when your parents took me in

19:04.371 --> 19:07.451
and grew me up and gave me
tons of free food and that.

19:07.491 --> 19:11.091
And maybe it will ruin our lives
if we keep her, who knows?

19:11.131 --> 19:16.011
All I know is, if we abandon her now
it'll definitely ruin hers.

19:19.891 --> 19:23.091
Oh, pissing buggernuts.

19:23.131 --> 19:26.851
What? Is that pissing buggernuts yes
or pissing buggernuts no?

19:26.891 --> 19:28.891
It's pissing buggernuts fine.

19:28.931 --> 19:31.931
If we really have to do this
then... fine.

19:31.971 --> 19:33.691
Nice one.

19:33.731 --> 19:36.731
Well, it's not exactly what I'd hoped
being single in the city

19:36.771 --> 19:39.291
in my early 20s would be like,
but there you go.

19:39.331 --> 19:43.851
I guess this is us now.
This is our weird little family.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.891
Forever.

19:45.931 --> 19:47.931
Forever.

19:47.971 --> 19:50.571
Shhh!

19:51.651 --> 19:53.411
Salve, Grumio.

19:53.451 --> 19:55.971
All right, Davus.
Shit! We don't owe rent, do we?

19:56.011 --> 19:59.011
No, no, no, it's not that.
It something personal, actually.

19:59.051 --> 20:01.571
It's a bit delicate.
OK. Cool. Go ahead.

20:01.611 --> 20:04.451
You see me and my wife have been
enjoying regular intercourse

20:04.491 --> 20:07.651
for years now. Well, thanks for
coming round. Do come again soon.

20:07.691 --> 20:09.451
There's more.
Is there? Oh, good.

20:09.491 --> 20:12.291
Now although I can make most people
do most things,

20:12.331 --> 20:16.171
I can't seem to get my missus up the
duff, no matter how hard I do her.

20:16.211 --> 20:19.571
Nothing would make us happier than
starting a little family of our own,

20:19.611 --> 20:21.371
so...
You can take her. She is yours.

20:21.411 --> 20:24.371
What? He's not having my baby.
Fair dos, I respect that.

20:24.411 --> 20:26.611
Wait a minute.
Let's think about this, Grumio.

20:26.651 --> 20:29.611
We just decided to keep her.
You said this were our weird family.

20:29.651 --> 20:31.531
I know. But he wants a weird family.

20:31.571 --> 20:33.571
Why can't he have
a weird family instead?

20:33.611 --> 20:36.571
He's a bloody great thug. I once
saw him bite a man's nose off.

20:36.611 --> 20:38.811
Really? Clean off?
Yeah, it was a work thing.

20:38.851 --> 20:41.931
It was a work thing! I'll be
the kindest dad in the world.

20:41.971 --> 20:43.691
We'd love her to bits, we would.

20:43.731 --> 20:45.931
My wife's baked you some biscuits.

20:47.251 --> 20:50.211
What flavour?
I think they're walnut and raisin.

20:50.251 --> 20:53.411
I like walnut. And raisin.

21:00.611 --> 21:02.611
She's crying again.

21:04.171 --> 21:06.011
Would you still call her Binny?

21:06.051 --> 21:08.491
Of course. It's a wicked name.

21:10.931 --> 21:15.131
And when I look back on the last six
years, I think I can say with pride

21:15.171 --> 21:18.251
that while I was here,
thirst was not.

21:18.291 --> 21:21.811
I want to wish the table
all the best.

21:21.851 --> 21:23.851
And I hope to remain in touch
with you all.

21:23.891 --> 21:26.451
And on my first day entering -

21:26.491 --> 21:29.731
What are you still doing here?
I asked you not to come in today.

21:29.771 --> 21:31.451
He's just making a farewell speech.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.891
Is it finished?
More or less.

21:35.611 --> 21:37.371
Well then.

21:40.851 --> 21:42.851
Goodbye, water boy.

21:42.891 --> 21:45.011
Goodbye.

21:45.051 --> 21:46.731
Burner, see to that.

21:46.771 --> 21:50.011
Now, Copier, I've finished three
reports for a departmental meeting

21:50.051 --> 21:51.771
this morning.
You're on fire. I know.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.451
The new windows have done wonders
for my concentration.

21:54.491 --> 21:56.171
No, you really are on fire!
What?

21:56.211 --> 21:58.051
I'm on fire.
Ah!

21:58.091 --> 22:00.491
I'm fucking well on fire!
Ah!

22:00.531 --> 22:03.611
Fire! Fire!

22:03.651 --> 22:07.011
Fire! I'm fucking on fire!

22:11.051 --> 22:12.851
Water man.

22:12.891 --> 22:16.211
Thank you, water man.

22:19.691 --> 22:23.091
So Aurelius is more useful
than a table? Who knew?

Yeah, the table's been burned
and the fire's been fired.

22:26.211 --> 22:29.531
You can come back in on Monday.
Sweet! Let's go out and celebrate.

22:29.571 --> 22:33.251
I'm afraid Marcus is busy tonight.
Enjoy the play.

22:46.771 --> 22:53.691
My hooves tremble as the Greek
warriors clamber up inside me.

22:54.051 --> 22:56.051
Ulysses.

22:56.091 --> 22:58.131
Menelaus.

22:58.171 --> 23:00.211
Ajax.

23:01.251 --> 23:03.491
Marcus.

23:03.531 --> 23:05.651
Marcus. Marcus!

23:05.691 --> 23:07.691
Huh? Mmm.
