WEBVTT

00:26.160 --> 00:29.097
-Titans, as you all know,
today is

00:29.130 --> 00:30.531
-Sports Day!

00:30.731 --> 00:33.367
-I did not know that.
-I didn't know either, brah.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.569
You guys know
it's Sports Day, right?

00:35.603 --> 00:36.837
-No.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.106
I see.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.174
Allow me to bring you all
up to speed.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.110
Today is Sports Day!

00:42.143 --> 00:45.179
Sports Day!

00:45.213 --> 00:48.116
Why do I even bother
printing up flyers?

00:48.149 --> 00:52.553
Today, we will be playing the
world's most popular sport...

00:52.586 --> 00:53.621
Futbol.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.723
Football? I love football!

00:58.192 --> 01:00.328
I didn't say we're playing
"football."

01:00.361 --> 01:01.862
Uh, pretty sure you did, bro.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.865
Uh, no, bro, I said
we're playing "futbol."

01:04.898 --> 01:07.101
Football? I love football!

01:07.135 --> 01:08.869
And he's going to the 50...
And he's going to the 40...

01:08.902 --> 01:11.472
No, we are
not playing football!

01:11.505 --> 01:14.442
Uh, I'm so confused, bro.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.477
We are playing futbol.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.112
Also known as soccer.

01:18.146 --> 01:19.447
Boooo!

01:19.480 --> 01:21.415
Don't nobody care
about soccer!

01:21.449 --> 01:24.185
It is the most tedious
of athletic events.

01:24.218 --> 01:27.188
It's just people
kicking a ball and then
pretending to be hurt.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.590
I don't like
"sock-her" either.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.125
I prefer "sock-him!"

01:32.693 --> 01:35.163
-Ha! I do get it.
That's good.

01:35.196 --> 01:38.699
Around the world,
futbol  ignites the
passions of the soul.

01:38.732 --> 01:41.402
It can bring a nation together
or tear it apart.

01:41.435 --> 01:45.239
Most importantly,
it is a metaphor
for the miracle of life.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.574
Are we still
talking about soccer?

01:46.607 --> 01:49.143
Stop calling it soccer!
It's futbol!

01:49.177 --> 01:52.413
You know, I've always thought
there was something sinister
about the sport.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.848
How can people
get so worked up
over a ball?

01:54.882 --> 01:59.653
It does seem unlikely
a dull game could inspire
such intense emotions, Robin.

01:59.687 --> 02:02.423
What about that time
when Cyborg played
duck, duck, goose?

02:02.456 --> 02:05.326
-The duck, the duck...

02:05.359 --> 02:06.594
The goose.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.163
-I am the goose!

02:09.197 --> 02:10.698
The goose!

02:10.731 --> 02:13.567
-I'm coming for ya!

02:13.601 --> 02:15.636
No one escapes the goose!

02:15.669 --> 02:17.705
Futbol  is a beautiful game.

02:17.738 --> 02:20.341
Now, say it,
and let it live
in your hearts.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.842
Futbol.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.512
-No, "futbol."

02:24.545 --> 02:26.714
-Futbol.
-With passion!

02:26.747 --> 02:30.451
-That's starting to sound
international.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.253
-Sock-him.
-BEAST BOY: Ow!

02:33.387 --> 02:34.455
I'm hilarious.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.458
Great energy!
Now let's take the field!

02:40.828 --> 02:43.297
We look like
the athletics professionals.

02:43.331 --> 02:46.534
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.
I gots me some shin pads, yo.

02:46.567 --> 02:49.437
-Kick me as hard as you can.
-Seems like a bad idea.

02:49.470 --> 02:52.973
Come on, I won't feel a thing.
It's shin armor, brah.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.242
Okay.

02:54.275 --> 02:57.245
Ow, my shin!

02:57.278 --> 02:59.247
You broke my shin!

02:59.280 --> 03:01.949
I too wish to test
the shin armor.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.819
They're not guarding anything!

03:05.853 --> 03:07.455
Not a thing!

03:07.488 --> 03:09.857
Oh, you guys playing
sock

03:09.890 --> 03:10.924
Cool.

03:13.961 --> 03:17.465
All right, enough
horseplay, guys.
Let's get to the basics.

03:17.498 --> 03:20.301
Because no one plays
soccer in our country,

03:20.334 --> 03:22.303
I've had this ball
shipped to us

03:22.336 --> 03:23.804
from halfway around the world.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.473
-ALL: Ooh.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.542
What a good-looking ball!

03:28.576 --> 03:29.810
Ooh, a collection of

03:29.843 --> 03:31.345
pentagons and hexagons

03:31.379 --> 03:32.480
forming a sphere.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.014
It's made out of science, yo!

03:34.047 --> 03:35.783
Stylish.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.786
It is true. The futbol
is the most stylish

03:38.819 --> 03:40.454
piece of equipment
in all of sports.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.927
Now, this is
an easy game to learn.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.930
You just have to
put the ball in the goal.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.799
No problem!

03:53.534 --> 03:55.369
Swish! Two points.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.870
-No points.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.939
-You can't use your hands.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.475
Things just got super weird!

04:01.509 --> 04:05.045
But how does one
manipulate the ball
without using the hands?

04:05.078 --> 04:06.680
Futbol.

04:09.517 --> 04:12.786
Oh, dudes, we use our foots.

04:12.820 --> 04:15.456
-But I don't have feet.
-Yes, you do.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.625
Oh, yeah,
I forgot about those.

04:17.658 --> 04:21.329
Now, pay attention
as I demonstrate
a proper futbol  kick.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.630
Hi-ja!

04:22.663 --> 04:26.033
There, I've scored a goal in
the appropriate futbol  style.

04:26.066 --> 04:29.370
Now let's celebrate
by saying "goal"
as long as possible.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.405
-Goal.

04:31.439 --> 04:34.842
The go...

04:34.875 --> 04:36.410
Unacceptable.

04:36.444 --> 04:39.547
Goooooooooooooal!

04:39.580 --> 04:40.981
-Not long enough.

04:41.515 --> 04:46.554
Goooooooooal!

04:47.087 --> 04:48.756
That's what I'm talking about!

04:48.789 --> 04:51.291
Now, let's fut  this bol!

05:01.569 --> 05:03.737
Ow!

05:05.873 --> 05:07.775
How could you
do me like that?

05:07.808 --> 05:10.511
Coach, I can't go on.

05:24.858 --> 05:28.095
-Wow! Futbol  isn't
boring at all.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.364
In fact, I feel like
I'm standing on

05:30.398 --> 05:31.899
-the precipice of greatness!

05:31.932 --> 05:34.735
I am a pillar of light
in a world of darkness!

05:34.768 --> 05:38.406
We're taking our first steps
into a new life, bro!

05:38.439 --> 05:41.409
The futbol  life!

05:46.046 --> 05:49.883
Why are we feeling
such intense of the emotions?

05:49.917 --> 05:52.386
These feelings,
they don't make sense.

05:52.420 --> 05:53.621
Of course they do.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.989
This beautiful, ha,
magical ball, ooh,

05:56.023 --> 05:58.125
was the key
to unlocking our passions.

05:58.158 --> 06:01.429
Still, something about this
feels unnatural...

06:01.795 --> 06:04.131
But I can't argue
with my feelings!

06:04.164 --> 06:09.136
Goal...

06:26.987 --> 06:29.623
-Hey, Rave,
could you pass the milk?
-Sure thing.

06:29.657 --> 06:30.691
Ha!

06:32.493 --> 06:35.629
ALL: Goal!

06:36.063 --> 06:38.065
-Excuse me, bro.
-Whoa!

06:38.999 --> 06:40.033
The pain!

06:40.067 --> 06:41.735
The pain!

06:44.204 --> 06:47.541
A red card?
You've got to be kidding me!

06:47.575 --> 06:48.709
I barely touched him.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.011
I don't wanna hear it.
You're out of here!

06:51.044 --> 06:52.446
Unbelievable!

06:52.480 --> 06:53.881
You need to get
your eyes checked!

06:55.583 --> 06:57.184
I never want to stop
the running!

06:57.217 --> 06:58.952
I feel so invigorated.

06:59.820 --> 07:03.491
We've never lived our lives
with such emotion.

07:03.524 --> 07:04.992
That's right.

07:05.025 --> 07:08.929
We've all been invigorated by
this magical, little futbol.

07:11.231 --> 07:13.233
Your hands!

07:13.266 --> 07:15.469
You're using your hands, bro!

07:22.743 --> 07:24.678
Whoa. What happened?

07:24.712 --> 07:27.515
Were we liking the soccer?

07:28.649 --> 07:30.183
What is that?

07:32.653 --> 07:33.954
-Hello!

07:34.522 --> 07:36.890
-I'm a soccer troll!

07:36.924 --> 07:40.794
My people are magical beings
that evoke intense passion
for the game of soccer.

07:40.828 --> 07:43.764
So, you guys use magic
to make people like soccer?

07:43.797 --> 07:47.234
Our King Goal,
Ruler of Soccer,
commands it.

07:47.267 --> 07:50.704
-So, soccer really is boring.
-Of course.

07:50.738 --> 07:53.040
Watching people kick a ball
and pretend to be hurt

07:53.073 --> 07:54.942
is the most boring thing
in the world.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.744
Yeah, that's what I said.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.146
King Goal knew
the only way to
create interest

07:59.179 --> 08:01.715
in his dull sport
was to use magic.

08:01.749 --> 08:05.519
No wonder the game
stirs such proud
but unearned emotions.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.555
What a monstrous sport!

08:07.588 --> 08:10.791
It's time people see soccer
for what it really is.

08:10.824 --> 08:11.992
Soccer troll.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.861
Take us to your leader.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.721
Well done, Titans.

08:40.754 --> 08:43.290
You've uncovered
my centuries-old plot

08:43.323 --> 08:45.726
to make soccer interesting.

08:45.759 --> 08:49.797
Give it up, Goal.
No more magic-ing people
into liking soccer.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.933
I must or the sport
would never survive.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.636
It's just people
kicking a ball and
pretending to be hurt.

08:55.669 --> 08:58.138
-One way or another,

08:58.171 --> 09:00.073
we're going to settle this.

09:00.340 --> 09:03.844
Then how about on the field?

09:05.846 --> 09:07.114
One goal.

09:08.181 --> 09:09.650
Sudden death.

09:11.318 --> 09:14.788
And if we win,
you call back
all the soccer trolls.

09:14.822 --> 09:15.923
And if we lose?

09:16.690 --> 09:17.925
Sudden death.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.994
I said "sudden death,"
didn't I? Thought I said
"sudden death."

09:21.028 --> 09:23.196
Sudden death!

09:43.350 --> 09:45.786
ALL: Goal!

09:45.819 --> 09:48.822
He is really good.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.691
You lose, Titans.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.726
Time to die.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.962
You're forgetting
one thing, Goal.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.164
The Titans are sore losers!

09:59.667 --> 10:00.367
Yaaaah!

10:06.807 --> 10:08.341
In the face!

10:11.111 --> 10:12.145
Larry!

10:12.179 --> 10:14.081
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.849
I'll call back
my soccer trolls.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.252
Ow! Ho-ho-ho-ho!

10:27.327 --> 10:29.096
I said, "you win."

10:29.129 --> 10:30.297
Why?

10:32.966 --> 10:34.868
So boring. Ugh.

10:35.368 --> 10:36.436
Hey, who wants to go bowling?

10:36.469 --> 10:39.006
-ROBIN: Yeah, bowling,
I can do that.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.741
BEAST BOY: Yeah, bowling!

10:44.111 --> 10:46.747
I'm a magical bowling turkey.
