18:25.563 --> 18:27.232
- She's Australian too.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.274
- What?

18:28.316 --> 18:30.694
- No "hello"?
I see how it is.

18:30.735 --> 18:32.737
Well, you're about to feel
real bad about being a dick

18:32.779 --> 18:34.489
because I'm calling
to offer you a job.

18:34.531 --> 18:36.574
- What kind of job?
A legal job?

18:36.616 --> 18:37.784
- That's a good question,
Cregory.

18:37.826 --> 18:40.286
Let me run it up the ladder
to my HR guy.

18:40.328 --> 18:42.080
- Get Dame to do it.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.873
- Nah, he's unavailable.

18:43.915 --> 18:45.542
He had a little mishap
on account of those

18:45.583 --> 18:46.751
dumbass wizard lenses.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.628
[truck horn blares]
- [screams]

18:48.670 --> 18:50.505
- Look, man, I'm just trying
to do your poor ass a favor.

18:50.547 --> 18:51.881
Just let me know if you're in.
- I'm not in.

18:51.923 --> 18:54.300
My poor ass
doesn't need any favors.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.386
As it so happens, I'm on my way

18:56.428 --> 18:58.972
to a business meeting
right now.

18:59.014 --> 19:01.057
So thank you,

19:01.099 --> 19:02.350
and go fuck yourself.

19:02.392 --> 19:03.935
- Just call me after
when it doesn't work out.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.353
- Go fuck yourself.

19:08.231 --> 19:10.150
- You're a businessman.

19:10.191 --> 19:11.860
Very cool.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.571
My father moved here
to be a businessman.

19:14.612 --> 19:16.448
And then he died.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.158
- Sorry to hear that.
- It's all right.

19:18.199 --> 19:22.829
It was sort of the best age
to lose your dad--

19:22.871 --> 19:25.540
as a teenager.

19:25.582 --> 19:28.251
So what's this big meeting?

19:28.293 --> 19:29.753
- [sighs]
I'm trying to buy some land

19:29.794 --> 19:31.588
so I could start
a saw palmetto farm.

19:31.629 --> 19:34.215
It's complicated.
- Wow.

19:34.257 --> 19:36.468
I wish I was good at business.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.054
I'm way in debt,
which is crazy,

19:39.095 --> 19:40.722
because I have so many jobs.

19:40.764 --> 19:43.558
I Uber. I Lyft. I TaskRabbit.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.436
I get paid by creeps online
to watch me eat bananas.

19:46.478 --> 19:48.605
I do a little elder care--
oh, shit!

19:48.646 --> 19:50.523
- What?
Wh-wh-what?

19:50.565 --> 19:52.108
[tires squeal]

19:52.150 --> 19:53.443
- [sighs]

19:53.485 --> 19:54.944
Sorry, I just have to do
one thing real quick.

19:54.986 --> 19:56.321
- No, I have a meeting.
- I know.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.447
But this will just take
one second.

19:57.489 --> 19:58.573
Please?
- [sighs]

19:58.615 --> 19:59.991
- Pretty please?
- Fine, fine, fine.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.034
- Great.

20:02.452 --> 20:03.870
- What's the hammer for?

20:03.912 --> 20:06.039
- Hammering.
Be right back.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.971
[yells]

20:22.013 --> 20:24.349
- What the fuck?

20:24.391 --> 20:26.559
- [yelling]

20:26.601 --> 20:29.562
[dramatic music]

20:29.604 --> 20:32.273
* *

20:32.315 --> 20:34.401
Nearly done!
Just wrapping up!

20:34.442 --> 20:36.528
Oh, shit!
Fuck you! Ah!

20:36.569 --> 20:39.114
- Oh, shit!
- Ah!

20:39.155 --> 20:41.366
[grunting]

20:41.408 --> 20:44.035
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

20:44.077 --> 20:46.162
- Hey, I'm just gonna get
another Uber.

20:46.204 --> 20:48.039
- No, no, no.
I'm done!

20:48.081 --> 20:49.749
I'm done.

20:49.791 --> 20:53.253
[panting]

20:53.294 --> 20:56.256
[grunting]

20:56.297 --> 21:00.552
* *

21:00.593 --> 21:02.554
Would you mind
sliding down a tad?

21:02.595 --> 21:04.973
I'm gonna need
a little room for this guy.

21:05.015 --> 21:07.517
- [screams]
No, no, no, no, no, no!

21:07.559 --> 21:10.729
No! No! No!

21:15.108 --> 21:17.068
- So you're probably wondering
about the snake.

21:17.110 --> 21:19.237
- Yeah, I'm wondering about
the fucking snake.

21:19.279 --> 21:21.656
That's exactly what
I'm wondering about, Jillian G.

21:21.698 --> 21:22.907
- It's all completely
above board.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.410
The state of Florida pays me
to do this job.

21:25.452 --> 21:26.745
Check it out.
I've got a pamphlet.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.249
Ten years ago,
there was a trend for people

21:31.291 --> 21:33.209
to get Burmese pythons as pets.

21:33.251 --> 21:34.836
They start out really cute.

21:34.878 --> 21:36.838
- That can't be true.
- It is.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.131
But then they got too big,

21:38.173 --> 21:40.133
so everyone drove
their snakes out to the swamps

21:40.175 --> 21:42.844
and set them free,
but they're not from here,

21:42.886 --> 21:45.513
so nothing eats them,
but they eat everything.

21:45.555 --> 21:46.598
Birds...
- Okay.

21:46.639 --> 21:47.932
- Alligators...
- Damn.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.559
- Even other snakes.
- Nasty.

21:49.601 --> 21:51.353
- It's an ecological disaster.

21:51.394 --> 21:53.980
So the state pays
removal agents

21:54.022 --> 21:56.941
100 bucks for every dead python
we bring in.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.277
It's a quick and easy way
to earn some extra cash.

21:59.319 --> 22:00.570
- Didn't seem easy.

22:00.612 --> 22:02.364
- They're not poisonous.
They're really slow.

22:02.405 --> 22:03.573
They're like big hot dogs

22:03.615 --> 22:05.784
that can bite you
or squeeze you to death.

22:05.825 --> 22:09.287
But also,
they can kind of smile.

22:09.329 --> 22:12.499
- You know, this has been
very informative and all that,

22:12.540 --> 22:14.167
but you think we--hey!

22:14.209 --> 22:15.627
Hey!
It's alive!

22:15.669 --> 22:16.753
You didn't kill it!
[python hisses]

22:16.795 --> 22:17.796
Shit!
- Okay.

22:17.837 --> 22:18.922
Okay, okay.
- [screams]

22:18.963 --> 22:20.340
Fuck!
- Stay calm! Just remember!

22:20.382 --> 22:21.758
It's more scared than you are!

22:21.800 --> 22:23.551
- [screams] That motherfucker's
not scared at all!

22:23.593 --> 22:24.803
- That must be
the brain damage.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.471
Sometimes they lose
all sense of reason.

22:26.513 --> 22:28.139
- [screaming]
- Grab its neck!

22:28.181 --> 22:29.432
- That doesn't help.
It's all neck!

22:29.474 --> 22:31.309
[both scream]

22:31.351 --> 22:33.395
Shit! Shit!

22:33.436 --> 22:34.688
- [screaming]
- Get off me!

22:34.729 --> 22:36.106
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Get off me!

22:36.147 --> 22:37.399
Ow!
- Sorry!

22:37.440 --> 22:38.483
[tires squealing]
Sorry!

22:38.525 --> 22:39.526
- Ow!
- Sorry!

22:39.567 --> 22:42.612
- Shit!
[both screaming]

22:42.654 --> 22:44.406
Ow, shit!
- [screaming]

22:44.447 --> 22:46.241
- Watch the road!
- [screaming]

22:46.282 --> 22:48.660
The window won't kill it!
- [screaming]

22:48.702 --> 22:51.037
Shit!
- Oh, shit!

22:59.796 --> 23:02.340
[rhythmic drum beats]

23:02.382 --> 23:06.511
- Okay, so I kind of feel like
I owe you an apology.

23:06.553 --> 23:07.762
You were right.

23:07.804 --> 23:09.931
The window thing worked.
You killed the snake!

23:09.973 --> 23:12.392
- That's not what you should be
apologizing for, Jillian G.

23:12.434 --> 23:14.102
- What do you think
I should be sorry about?

23:14.144 --> 23:15.311
- Everything!

23:15.353 --> 23:17.647
The generalities
of this whole situation.

23:17.689 --> 23:21.401
- Okay, but the window thing
was super smart.

23:21.443 --> 23:24.029
So many people overlook
the cerebral aspect

23:24.070 --> 23:25.947
of snake-killing.

23:25.989 --> 23:28.616
Hey, would you ever
wanna team up?

23:28.658 --> 23:30.535
Your brains, my hammer?

23:30.577 --> 23:33.038
- I just wanna get
to my meeting.

23:33.079 --> 23:34.205
Does your car still drive?

23:34.247 --> 23:35.874
- Oh, yeah, for sure.

23:35.915 --> 23:38.752
I'll just throw it in reverse
and get you there in no time.

23:38.793 --> 23:40.462
- My special suit.

23:40.503 --> 23:41.963
I can't show up
looking like this.

23:42.005 --> 23:43.256
- Not a problem.

23:43.298 --> 23:45.300
I have clothes
you could change into.

23:48.511 --> 23:50.722
- Do you live in there?
- Yeah, it's great.

23:50.764 --> 23:52.098
I got a bed.

23:52.140 --> 23:54.392
I got a couple garbage bags
with my things.

23:56.144 --> 23:57.103
That's pretty much it.

23:57.145 --> 23:58.438
- Where do you go
to the bathroom?

23:58.480 --> 23:59.356
- Starbucks.

23:59.397 --> 24:00.732
It's actually awesome.
- It is?

24:00.774 --> 24:02.901
- Does your bathroom
get cleaned twice a day?

24:02.942 --> 24:05.195
- Look, this is very nice
and more than a little bleak,

24:05.236 --> 24:06.654
but I don't think
you have anything in there

24:06.696 --> 24:08.031
that'll fit me.

24:08.073 --> 24:11.326
- Oh, really?

24:13.203 --> 24:15.497
- What the hell is that?
- My graduation gown.

24:15.538 --> 24:17.999
Florida School of Excellence,
class of '07.

24:18.041 --> 24:19.709
Go Titties!

24:19.751 --> 24:21.127
The old mascot was racist,

24:21.169 --> 24:23.546
so they let the students vote
on a new one.

24:28.009 --> 24:30.595
That color does
really pop on you.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.639
Quick tip, though--
stay in the shade

24:32.681 --> 24:34.391
because that fabric
melts in the sun

24:34.432 --> 24:36.476
and it will burn your skin.

24:41.272 --> 24:44.359
[engine sputtering]

24:51.866 --> 24:54.577
- Mr. Assarian.

24:54.619 --> 24:55.787
I'm Craig.

24:59.082 --> 25:00.250
- What are you wearing?
- This?

25:00.291 --> 25:02.210
Oh, it's a, uh...

25:02.252 --> 25:03.503
it's a gown.

25:03.545 --> 25:05.755
Standard business casual gown.

25:05.797 --> 25:07.716
Look, I have a presentation
for you, okay?

25:07.757 --> 25:09.050
- Yeah.
- Okay.

25:10.719 --> 25:12.012
It's 4:00 a.m.

25:12.053 --> 25:13.680
Miami is asleep.

25:13.722 --> 25:16.975
But I'm wide awake.
Why? Am I out at the clubs?

25:17.017 --> 25:18.810
Do I rise
with the European markets?

25:18.852 --> 25:20.186
No.

25:20.228 --> 25:21.855
I just really have to pee.

25:21.896 --> 25:23.481
[mosquito buzzing]

25:25.400 --> 25:27.527
This is a
all-too-familiar-story

25:27.569 --> 25:31.406
for a man of over 40,
50, or even 60.

25:33.533 --> 25:35.035
What's the deal?

25:35.076 --> 25:37.287
What's, uh, the deal?

25:37.328 --> 25:40.874
[watch ticking]

25:40.915 --> 25:42.542
Okay.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.377
Look, I know this seems crazy.

25:44.419 --> 25:47.672
I'm late.
I show up in a billboard.

25:47.714 --> 25:50.050
When I was a kid,
my dad told me

25:50.091 --> 25:52.927
if I worked hard,
I could make it.

25:52.969 --> 25:54.846
I could become rich.

25:54.888 --> 25:56.306
[soft dramatic music]

25:56.348 --> 25:57.640
"It won't be easy," he said,

25:57.682 --> 26:02.187
"but you just gotta
have faith."

26:02.228 --> 26:04.230
And then he died.

26:04.272 --> 26:08.193
He wasn't rich.
He wasn't anything.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.403
But I carried on his dream.

26:10.445 --> 26:12.322
I just thought that,

26:12.364 --> 26:16.368
you know,
if I could prove him right,

26:16.409 --> 26:19.079
then his life
would've meant something.

26:19.120 --> 26:21.414
His death
would've meant something.

26:21.456 --> 26:26.211
And I waited and I worked
through setback after setback,

26:26.252 --> 26:28.380
and it's just getting
so damn hard.

26:28.421 --> 26:30.632
And I just wanted a sign--

26:30.674 --> 26:33.635
anything to tell me
to keep going.

26:33.677 --> 26:36.721
So when you called this morning
out of nowhere,

26:36.763 --> 26:38.807
that's what
I'd been waiting for.

26:38.848 --> 26:40.684
It was like
the heavens opened up

26:40.725 --> 26:43.103
and I could hear
the angels singing.

26:43.144 --> 26:45.772
So now, if you say no,

26:45.814 --> 26:49.901
it's not just that I won't get
to start my new business.

26:49.943 --> 26:54.197
This is everything
I've ever believed in.

26:54.239 --> 26:56.199
So I'm asking you,

26:56.241 --> 26:58.952
please,

26:58.993 --> 27:00.662
reward my faith.

27:03.123 --> 27:05.709
- Fuck him.
That guy's a dick.

27:10.422 --> 27:12.674
Do you mind if we make
a quick pit stop?

27:14.509 --> 27:16.678
- I feel like I'm going
above and beyond here

27:16.720 --> 27:18.638
in my role as Uber passenger.

27:18.680 --> 27:21.307
- Okay, I didn't wanna
ruin the surprise,

27:21.349 --> 27:24.144
but I'm gonna give you
the 100 bucks

27:24.185 --> 27:25.687
to invest in your business.

27:25.729 --> 27:27.063
- What? Why?

27:27.105 --> 27:29.441
- Do you know why my
graduation gown wasn't melted?

27:29.482 --> 27:30.525
- I assumed because you were

27:30.567 --> 27:31.651
sittin' in the shade
or whatever.

27:31.693 --> 27:33.611
- [laughs]
There's no shade

27:33.653 --> 27:36.072
at the Florida School
of Excellence.

27:36.114 --> 27:39.200
Wake up, man!
I didn't graduate.

27:39.242 --> 27:41.828
Remember when I said
16 was a good age

27:41.870 --> 27:43.538
to have your dad die?

27:43.580 --> 27:45.665
It wasn't.
I tricked you.

27:45.707 --> 27:48.001
I kind of stopped
going to school after that--

27:48.043 --> 27:50.920
stopped really doing anything.

27:50.962 --> 27:53.340
Things have been tough
since then, and I don't know,
