01:06.100 --> 01:07.701
Hey. What have we got?

01:07.801 --> 01:10.504
Fire was called in
around 11:00 by a neighbor.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.640
Firefighters said it spread
through most of the house.

01:12.740 --> 01:13.807
How many
bodies inside?

01:13.907 --> 01:15.843
Two.
And why
are we outside?

01:15.943 --> 01:17.745
Still waiting for
a search warrant.

01:17.845 --> 01:18.979
It's 4:00 a.m.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.481
We can't in the scene
because of paperwork?

01:20.581 --> 01:22.616
Nobody could get a judge
on the phone this hour.

01:22.716 --> 01:23.684
Serena's working on it.

01:27.321 --> 01:28.722
Hey!

01:28.822 --> 01:30.591
It was really good to see you.

01:31.592 --> 01:32.960
Don't look like a judge to me.

01:34.395 --> 01:36.630
Something over there
more important?

01:36.730 --> 01:40.468
No, sorry. Warrant's in.

01:40.568 --> 01:41.569
You're good to go.

01:41.669 --> 01:42.736
All right. You heard the woman.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.004
Get on in.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.873
I'm going to go
hustle with the VFD.

01:45.973 --> 01:47.475
Hey, how long are we going
to be out here?

01:47.575 --> 01:50.911
Those poor firemen.
She is cranky tonight.

01:51.011 --> 01:52.513
We got to get in,
we got to get in.

01:52.613 --> 01:55.183
Yeah, who's your
friend there?

01:55.283 --> 01:58.552
Oh, Joselyn Lozando.
Old girlfriend.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.155
Oh, she the one
you dated last year?

02:01.255 --> 02:04.725
No, Jocelyn and I got together
when I first moved out to Vegas.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.560
The house has
security cameras.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.962
I'm going to see if
the footage survived.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.142
What?

02:27.315 --> 02:28.749
Hmm.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.485
17 inches.

02:31.585 --> 02:34.188
Whoever he is, he's got
a future in the NBA.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.690
You smell that gasoline?

02:36.790 --> 02:39.159
Mmm. Definitely
not an accidental fire.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.229
Wow. They
poured a ton.

02:41.329 --> 02:44.198
Somebody really wanted
this place to burn.

02:49.102 --> 02:51.605
These poor people.

02:52.240 --> 02:56.877
Hey, Al, the positioning
doesn't make sense.

02:56.977 --> 03:00.481
I mean, how do you just sit
there while the place burns?

03:00.581 --> 03:02.082
I don't think they did.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.584
Their arms are wrong.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.085
Heat from the fire
would have shrunk

03:05.185 --> 03:07.921
their muscles and tendons,
pulling them up.

03:10.057 --> 03:13.026
The pugilist attitude. Mm-hmm.
Right.

03:13.126 --> 03:17.231
Their arms are down,
their backs aren't arched.

03:17.331 --> 03:19.733
They must have been restrained.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.535
I'm not seeing any
restraints. You?

03:21.635 --> 03:22.636
Must have burned away.

03:22.736 --> 03:23.704
So, whoever did this

03:23.804 --> 03:24.772
tied two people down,

03:24.872 --> 03:26.407
doused the place in gasoline,

03:26.507 --> 03:28.075
and just let them burn.

03:33.080 --> 03:36.350
Hey.
Hey. Is that enough
coffee for you?

03:36.450 --> 03:38.185
Not even close.
What you got?

03:38.286 --> 03:39.820
So I, uh, ran the video

03:39.920 --> 03:41.589
from the burned house's
security camera.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.724
I've ID'd the victims,

03:43.824 --> 03:45.659
and, uh, I might
have an explanation for

03:45.759 --> 03:47.395
the footprint they
found outside the door.

03:47.495 --> 03:49.930
This is the homeowner,
Davis Painter.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.665
This is a couple hours before
the fire was called in.

03:51.765 --> 03:52.666
Mm-hmm.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.034
90 minutes later,

03:54.134 --> 03:55.336
this guy rolls in.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.537
I did a facial rec search.

03:56.637 --> 03:57.938
His name is Elliott Painter.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.507
He's Davis Painter's father.

03:59.607 --> 04:00.808
Elliott Painter?

04:00.908 --> 04:01.909
What, you know him?
Of him.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.411
He's-he's big into real estate.

04:03.511 --> 04:04.912
He builds homes for celebrities.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.981
He's like got a lot
of juiced-up friends.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.251
That's it, as far as anyone
going into the house.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.153
You said you had something
on a footprint, right?

04:13.253 --> 04:16.657
The camera got something coming
out that must have made it.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.258
Coming out but not going in?

04:18.359 --> 04:20.127
Yeah, but, honestly,
that's not even the weird part.

04:20.227 --> 04:24.798
This is like a minute
before the fire started.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.569
Okay, run that back.

04:33.173 --> 04:35.208
Is that Bigfoot?

04:35.309 --> 04:37.210
You said it. Not me.

04:37.311 --> 04:39.447
Okay.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.749
We got a dead father and a son,

04:41.849 --> 04:43.551
murdered in a fire.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.653
And before the
fire starts,

04:45.753 --> 04:47.888
Sasquatch runs out.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.089
Mm-hmm.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.461

reclusive citizen of the

05:44.277 --> 05:47.080
All right, see,

05:47.180 --> 05:48.482
primates, like apes,

05:48.582 --> 05:52.420
they do this bent-knee,
bent-hip walking.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.522
Their torsos bend forward
and their knees

05:54.622 --> 05:56.424
bend at about 100 degrees.

05:56.524 --> 05:58.058
Humans, we walk upright.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.960
Our knees bend
at about 170.

06:00.060 --> 06:03.497
This is not a mythical creature
of lore and legend.

06:03.597 --> 06:06.467
That's a guy in a costume.

06:06.567 --> 06:07.935
I just got off the phone
with Hitchens

06:08.035 --> 06:09.369
from the fire department.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.739
He is not assigning us
an arson investigator.

06:11.839 --> 06:12.973
Excuse me?

06:13.073 --> 06:14.007
They're too short-handed
and slammed.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.308
There's no one to spare.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.212
You know why he's doing this?

06:19.312 --> 06:20.481
He is an interim chief.

06:20.581 --> 06:21.915
He's afraid it can't close

06:22.015 --> 06:23.584
and he's afraid of what it will
do to his stats.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.686
I have two
crispy victims out there.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.955
I have a crime scene
that needs to be picked over

06:28.055 --> 06:29.757
and re--

06:31.825 --> 06:35.095
Um, do you have any
problems with sharing this?

06:35.195 --> 06:36.630
No.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.131
None at all.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.568
Great. Get on it. Thank you.

06:42.670 --> 06:43.837
Uh...

06:43.937 --> 06:45.105
What's up?

06:45.205 --> 06:46.974
I really don't
want to be a pest,

06:47.074 --> 06:49.877
but is everything all right?

06:52.546 --> 06:54.381
You just seemed a little
out of sorts last night.

06:54.482 --> 06:57.350
It was 4:00 a.m. I'm fine.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.320
Okay.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.924
Okay.
Yep.

07:20.674 --> 07:21.709
Okay.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.444
I finished pulling
the furniture.

07:24.545 --> 07:25.946
The grid is laid out.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.314
And you sound happy.
I am.

07:27.414 --> 07:28.782
It's my first arson case.

07:28.882 --> 07:29.950
I am fired up.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.785
Pun intended?
Mm-hmm.

07:31.885 --> 07:32.886
All right,

07:32.986 --> 07:34.387
see the line where
the discoloration

07:34.488 --> 07:35.923
starts to
darken the wall?

07:37.691 --> 07:39.159
Yeah.
Well, the fact
that it's so low

07:39.259 --> 07:41.762
means that a lot of heated
air gathered in here.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.263
And the carpet
is badly burned.

07:43.363 --> 07:44.998
So is the flooring underneath.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.968
Usually, the flooring
escapes the worst of it.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.236
You know, heat rises.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.338
Maybe the floor was
the point of ignition.

07:52.339 --> 07:53.607
To know who started the fire,

07:53.707 --> 07:55.075
we need to know how it started.

07:55.175 --> 07:59.246
So, we collect every bit
of ash and charred debris,

07:59.346 --> 08:01.014
and we sort through it.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.952
All of it?
Every bit.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.556
Davis and Elliot
went to the same dentist.

08:08.656 --> 08:11.324
So both of their
files are in there.

08:11.424 --> 08:12.726
You aren't sure it's them?

08:12.826 --> 08:14.828
Dental records are
used to confirm,

08:14.928 --> 08:19.266
but preliminary DNA analysis
doesn't leave much doubt.

08:19.366 --> 08:20.534
I'm so sorry.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.736
Davis is my only baby.

08:22.836 --> 08:23.804
I can't...

08:23.904 --> 08:25.939
You and Mr. Painter
were divorced?

08:26.039 --> 08:28.842
Yes, and-and you would say,
I guess, it was amicable.

08:28.942 --> 08:31.845
The house belonged to
your son, right?

08:31.945 --> 08:33.180
Mm-hmm.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.549
Any idea why Elliot
might have come over?

08:35.649 --> 08:37.785
Problem with the
renovation, probably.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.486
Elliot was helping
Davis flip that house,

08:39.587 --> 08:42.923
and he was trying to
help get him back on track.

08:43.023 --> 08:46.627
Davis started smoking a lot
of pot after college, and...

08:46.727 --> 08:48.161
A little trouble launching.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.396
Something like that. Yeah.

08:49.496 --> 08:52.666
He was just starting
to find himself.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.635
Can you think of anyone
who'd want to hurt

08:54.735 --> 08:56.804
your son or your ex-husband?

08:56.904 --> 09:00.574
No. In real estate, when
people get mad, they just sue.

09:00.674 --> 09:01.775
Any particular reason

09:01.875 --> 09:03.577
people would be
upset at your ex?

09:03.677 --> 09:04.978
No, Elliot became famous

09:05.078 --> 09:06.847
building showy homes
for headliners.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.949
But he made his money putting
up housing developments.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.551
They could be pretty
bottom-line about it.

09:11.652 --> 09:14.421
Is that your polite way
of saying he's cheap?

09:14.521 --> 09:15.689
Let's just say
Elliot didn't mind

09:15.789 --> 09:17.825
cutting a corner to
save a dollar.

09:17.925 --> 09:21.028
And I told him,
it is not worth it.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.996
You always pay in the end.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.732
Thank you for this, okay?

09:24.832 --> 09:25.633
Mm-hmm.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.400
We'll do our best.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.737
Will you? Here you go.

09:29.837 --> 09:32.072
Come with me.
I'll see you out.

09:34.975 --> 09:35.843
Oh, my God.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.745
Bryan, what's up? You okay?

09:37.845 --> 09:41.081
Come on, Mom, you know that's
not the only reason I call.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.115
I'm sorry, but you okay?

09:42.215 --> 09:43.383
Calling to say hey.

09:43.483 --> 09:44.952
And you haven't
called in a while,

09:45.052 --> 09:46.754
so I-I'm checking in here.
How you doing?

09:46.854 --> 09:48.689
I'm fine. It's just things
have been really crazy here.

09:48.789 --> 09:49.990
Can I call you back though?

09:50.090 --> 09:52.192
Yeah, sure.
I mean, if you're busy.

09:52.292 --> 09:53.126
Okay, thanks.

09:55.395 --> 09:57.064
Love you, too.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.937
Yo, Allie, heard a rumor
you were running this one.

10:04.037 --> 10:07.474
Sharing it, actually,
with Folsom. Oh.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.476
Is that weird?

10:09.576 --> 10:11.011
I mean, now that he's
with Chavez?

10:13.480 --> 10:15.015
You guys had a thing, right?

10:15.115 --> 10:17.284
What? No. No thing.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.619
It's not weird either, at all.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.488
Sorry, I could have
sworn that you guys...

10:21.588 --> 10:24.291
So is this the son,
Davis Painter?

10:24.391 --> 10:26.293
Uh, yes. Yes, yes.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.095
Headline there:

10:28.195 --> 10:30.363
He was already dead
when the fire started.

10:30.463 --> 10:35.002
So, no soot or particulate
in his esophagus or lungs?

10:35.102 --> 10:36.770
No, not even in
his nose or mouth.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.305
Well, then how did he die?

10:38.405 --> 10:39.439
I'm not sure.

10:39.539 --> 10:40.841
There was visceral congestion,

10:40.941 --> 10:42.342
which suggests asphyxiation.

10:42.442 --> 10:45.245
But the hyoid bone's intact
and there's no bruising.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.480
So, he wasn't strangled?
No, no.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.149
Definitely not.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.851
Oh, there is one
interesting thing though.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.453
Look at this.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.992
That's not flesh.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.160
No.

11:00.260 --> 11:03.897
Look, there's some
other pieces stuck on.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.799
What is it?

11:05.899 --> 11:07.467
Plastic.

11:07.567 --> 11:08.769
Very thin.

11:08.869 --> 11:11.171
I was thinking
shrink-wrap maybe.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.773
But you said there's
no soot in his mouth.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.641
It would make sense
if his mouth and nose

11:14.742 --> 11:16.109
were covered by plastic.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.850
What a cruel
thing to do to someone.

11:22.950 --> 11:24.384
Did they both die
like that?

11:24.484 --> 11:27.020
I haven't even
gotten into Dad yet.

11:35.628 --> 11:38.799
I don't see any plastic.

11:38.899 --> 11:41.601
They were bound
facing each other.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.772
But if only
Davis was asphyxiated,

11:44.872 --> 11:46.439
does that mean
the killer

11:46.539 --> 11:48.776
made Elliot watch
his son suffocate?

11:53.646 --> 11:55.582
There's definitely
soot in his mouth.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.617
What do we have here?

12:01.654 --> 12:02.856
What did I do?

12:02.956 --> 12:04.858
Drop it.

12:08.261 --> 12:09.129
What was that?

12:09.229 --> 12:10.764
An alarm
that sounds

12:10.864 --> 12:12.432
if a toxic substance
is released.

12:12.532 --> 12:13.834
Well, define
toxic substance.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.368
It could be
one of several.

12:15.468 --> 12:18.371
But since neither of us are dead
or puking our guts out...

12:18.471 --> 12:20.440
It was radioactive?

12:20.540 --> 12:22.843
Yeah, 1.2 millisieverts.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.145
Won't do any damage,
but it's definitely hot.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.748
How does a radioactive cloth end
up inside the victim's mouth?

12:28.849 --> 12:30.117
I don't know.

12:30.217 --> 12:33.653
Unless, does Bigfoot
have radioactive breath?

12:33.753 --> 12:35.488
No, that's Godzilla.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.957
Oh.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.259
Hey.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.330
You know plastics, right?

12:43.430 --> 12:44.597
What am I looking at here?

12:44.697 --> 12:46.033
I'll bet my Dow pension
it is HDPE.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.201
That stuff you make
gallon milk jugs out of.

12:48.301 --> 12:49.803
I found another
puddle of it over here.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.238
Blackened like this one?

12:51.338 --> 12:52.205
Just like it.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.273
We might be looking at

12:53.373 --> 12:54.374
point of origin for the fire.

12:54.474 --> 12:55.675
Let's see if
there's others.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.498
Eight points of origin.

13:18.598 --> 13:19.632
How do you start a fire

13:19.732 --> 13:20.834
in eight different places
at once?

13:20.934 --> 13:23.703
Don't know. We better find out.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.379
Your coffee's leaking.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.249
Found anything?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.518
Yep, a substance in the ash
we weren't able to identify.

14:11.618 --> 14:12.719
Beau is running it.

14:12.819 --> 14:15.155
And also this.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.357
Is that a...?
An engagement ring?

14:17.457 --> 14:18.525
I think so.

14:18.625 --> 14:19.826
Checked with the
Painter family.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.794
It didn't belong
to Davis or Elliot.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.396
And I don't know
why an arsonist brings

14:23.496 --> 14:25.665
a ring to a fire,
but apparently he did.

14:25.765 --> 14:26.833
No sign of the stone?

14:26.934 --> 14:28.468
Mm-mm.
Too bad.

14:28.568 --> 14:31.838
Sometimes diamonds have
serial numbers etched on them.

14:31.939 --> 14:33.373
Might help us
identify the owner.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.008
Can I talk to you?

14:35.108 --> 14:36.143
Yeah.

14:38.611 --> 14:39.846
Hey.

14:39.947 --> 14:42.215
I just got a text
from Jocelyn Lozando.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.884
She wants to get together
tonight, catch up.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.619
So, I'm going to go.

14:46.719 --> 14:47.854
We're working a case.

14:47.955 --> 14:49.589
All my queries are out.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.458
There's nothing
left for me to do tonight.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.327
You don't want to
stay and play in the soot?

14:55.495 --> 14:57.097
Tempting.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.466
But I haven't seen Jocelyn
in a really long time.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.402
And this is the only night
she's off for a few weeks, so...

15:03.403 --> 15:04.671
Well, have a good time.

15:04.771 --> 15:06.306
Thanks.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.208
I will call you tonight?

15:08.308 --> 15:10.010
Okay.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.684
Spectrometer
has spoken.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.152
Phosphorous pentoxide.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.521
But phosphorous ignites
when it's exposed to air.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.556
Yeah, you throw some on top
of a big puddle of gasoline,

15:23.656 --> 15:25.025
you got yourself
one hell of a blaze.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.360
Well, there has to be
some way to delay the ignition.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.463
Otherwise, you're just
setting yourself on fire.

15:30.563 --> 15:33.000
Is there any evidence
of an ignition device?

15:33.100 --> 15:35.135
Melted plastic,
phosphorous, gas.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.803
Hmm, not much
of a trigger.
Mm-mm.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.405
Your coffee's still leaking.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.411
Yes, it is.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.913
I mean, the fire department

15:47.014 --> 15:49.216
usually does this
sort of thing, right?

15:49.316 --> 15:50.750
Apparently,
they're busy.

15:52.986 --> 15:54.487
Ready for phosphorous.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.025
Look, I mean,

15:58.125 --> 15:59.259
I-I don't mean
to be a nervous Nellie,

15:59.359 --> 16:00.660
I'm just concerned about
setting fire to,

16:00.760 --> 16:01.861
you know, Las Vegas.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.930
I think that's highly unlikely.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.932
You hear that?
Highly unlikely.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.701
Okay.

16:08.801 --> 16:09.836
Okey-doke.
You ready?

16:09.936 --> 16:12.239
Mm-hmm.
One,

16:12.339 --> 16:14.474
two, three.

16:15.142 --> 16:17.410
Okay, so when the gasoline
level drops low enough,

16:17.510 --> 16:21.214
that phosphorous is exposed
to the air and ignites.

16:35.962 --> 16:38.965
Leaky coffee,
leaky gasoline.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.933
That's how you
light eight fires at once.

16:41.034 --> 16:42.369
What was that?

16:42.469 --> 16:44.304
I think it's
phosphorous pentoxide.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.539
A bunch of it must have
been thrown into the air.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.543
We need to go back
to the Painter house.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.479
I think there might
be more to find there.

16:52.579 --> 16:53.746
I told you,
we searched it.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.316
No, you only searched
half of it.

17:04.124 --> 17:09.462
Michelangelo,
Galileo Galilei and...

17:09.562 --> 17:11.898
Allie Rajan.

17:11.998 --> 17:14.033
Which one of these things
is not like the others?

17:14.134 --> 17:18.438
No, just three geniuses who
looked upward and were inspired.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.673
You know, Al,
you might be a little more

17:20.773 --> 17:22.842
optimistic that the killer
left some trace on the ceiling.

17:22.942 --> 17:27.013
If a shockwave can throw bits
of phosphorous in the air...

17:30.750 --> 17:32.219
...it can throw other things.

17:32.319 --> 17:34.687
That bake into the ceiling?

17:34.787 --> 17:36.589
I'm not seeing anything.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.696
Whoa, hold on,
hold on. Go back.

17:46.466 --> 17:47.700
What is that?

17:53.973 --> 17:55.775
Huh.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.645
Wouldn't you know. Hmm.

17:58.745 --> 18:02.115
I believe the ring you found
had a missing stone.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.154
No serial number.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.588
No etching of any kind.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.890
Some diamonds just
don't have it, I'm sorry.

18:10.990 --> 18:13.126
Strange discoloration
on one of the surfaces though.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.461
Lower right.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.630
Could be skin cells.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.167
I'll prep it,
take a look.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.613
Oh, come on.

18:41.188 --> 18:43.055
Hmm.

18:43.156 --> 18:44.857
Gotcha.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.560
So, you found skin cells
on the diamond?

18:47.660 --> 18:50.363
Isolated the DNA,
ran it through CODIS,

18:50.463 --> 18:51.798
but no matches.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.032
It doesn't match for
the Painters either,

18:53.132 --> 18:55.001
so we got no idea
who it belongs to.

18:55.101 --> 18:56.836
We know it's a human.
We can say that.

18:56.936 --> 18:59.639
What else can you say?

18:59.739 --> 19:01.874
Well, uh, someone
entered the house

19:01.974 --> 19:03.243
without triggering the cameras.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.178
Probably before
Davis Painter got home.

19:05.278 --> 19:07.514
Could be that they
forced him to call his father

19:07.614 --> 19:09.649
and convince him
to come to the house.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.184
They restrained both men,
suffocated Davis,

19:11.284 --> 19:13.386
and then set the fire
with a phosphorous trigger.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.754
No, the trigger's his signature.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.923
It tells us
the killer knows chemistry.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.225
And he really hated Elliot.

19:18.325 --> 19:19.692
I mean, the amount of gas used,

19:19.792 --> 19:20.927
the ignition method,

19:21.027 --> 19:22.462
someone spent a lot of time

19:22.562 --> 19:24.431
and a lot of effort
torturing the man.

19:24.531 --> 19:28.134
Every councilman in this city
wants an update on this case.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.436
They don't know
the difference between

19:29.536 --> 19:30.670
phosphorous or pyrophorus.

19:30.770 --> 19:31.904
But, you know,

19:32.004 --> 19:33.606
I don't know what to
say to these people.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.408
W-We'll go get you some answers.
Okay, thank you.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.510
Wait a minute,
before you go,

19:37.610 --> 19:39.111
you say that the guy
got in the house without

19:39.212 --> 19:40.713
being seen by
the cameras, right?

19:40.813 --> 19:42.815
Mm-hmm.
Yes.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.217
Tomorrow morning,
start there, please.

19:45.117 --> 19:47.887
This is Detective Chavez,
Las Vegas Police.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.789
Please leave your name and
number and I'll call you back.

19:49.889 --> 19:53.926
Hello, this is Joshua Folsom
of the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.363
I don't require immediate
assistance, but, uh...

19:58.097 --> 20:00.867
uh, hey,
Serena, just wondering

20:00.967 --> 20:02.702
if your dinner is over.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.671
Maybe we could
get together tonight.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.406
All right, give me a call.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.270
You still friends
with your exes?

20:39.439 --> 20:40.807
This about Chavez?

20:40.907 --> 20:43.376
Would it help if I said
"asking for a friend"?

20:44.544 --> 20:49.349
Josh, don't take
this the wrong way, but...

20:50.350 --> 20:53.252
I don't want to do
relationship advice.

20:53.353 --> 20:56.323
Oh, yeah, I get it.

20:57.324 --> 20:59.158
So, entry points.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.060
I'll take the front,
you take the back?

21:01.160 --> 21:02.662
All right.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.604
Mom.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.407
Hold on a second.
What are you doing here?

21:14.507 --> 21:15.542
I don't know.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.276
Hoping to have a conversation.

21:17.377 --> 21:18.811
You said you'd call me back.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.246
This is the second time
this week you blew me off.

21:20.347 --> 21:22.349
No, I did not.

21:22.449 --> 21:23.983
Mom, you normally respond

21:24.083 --> 21:25.251
to your text messages
right away.

21:25.352 --> 21:26.519
And on Monday, I didn't
hear back from you

21:26.619 --> 21:27.687
until 3:00 in the morning.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.155
I was just busy. That's all.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.357
I've seen you busy.

21:30.457 --> 21:31.658
You weren't like this.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.493
What's going on, Mom?

21:33.593 --> 21:34.661
It's just too much work, okay?

21:34.761 --> 21:35.662
That's all.

21:35.762 --> 21:37.029
That's all.

21:38.230 --> 21:39.399
Hey.

21:39.499 --> 21:40.700
Let's have lunch.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.968
I've got a couple
things left to do,

21:42.068 --> 21:44.437
then you and I
can go grab a bite.

21:44.537 --> 21:46.339
Okay.
All right.

21:46.439 --> 21:48.040
Do you remember
where my office is?
Mm-hmm.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.610
Meet there and I'll come
get you as soon as I'm done.

21:50.710 --> 21:51.811
Yes, ma'am.

21:51.911 --> 21:54.046
You messing with me.

22:24.076 --> 22:25.978
Allie.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.116
Got something?

22:30.216 --> 22:31.518
Yeah, someone
took out the screws

22:31.618 --> 22:33.219
that hold the
screen in.

22:39.158 --> 22:41.127
Crawlspace runs all
the way to the basement.

22:41.227 --> 22:42.495
That would give them
access to the house

22:42.595 --> 22:43.930
without going past the camera.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.197
This is a pretty small hole.

22:45.297 --> 22:47.066
Our Bigfoot's
well over six foot.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.901
I don't think that
someone his size

22:49.001 --> 22:51.237
would fit through this. Hey.

22:52.472 --> 22:54.040
Someone did fit through it.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.542
See that?

22:55.642 --> 22:57.877
<i>And left a little bit
of themselves behind.</i>

23:05.985 --> 23:07.520
Polyamide.
Hmm.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.321
Artificial fiber. Nylon 6.

23:09.422 --> 23:11.190
You find it in cars,
airplanes, all sorts of fabrics.

23:11.290 --> 23:12.592
Okay, what about
the dirt I found?

23:12.692 --> 23:14.060
That's more interesting.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.528
Huh, under the microscope,

23:15.628 --> 23:17.363
there was a substance
that I couldn't identify.

23:17.464 --> 23:19.599
So, I ran it in the Atlas,
because we don't have

23:19.699 --> 23:21.333
a scanning
electron microscope.

23:21.434 --> 23:22.635
And can I just say,

23:22.735 --> 23:23.836
for-forgive me for
getting on my soapbox,

23:23.936 --> 23:25.137
but the fact
that this office,

23:25.237 --> 23:26.506
with the important
work that it does,

23:26.606 --> 23:28.207
doesn't have a scanning
electron microscope,

23:28.307 --> 23:29.241
it's a crime
against science... Beau.

23:29.341 --> 23:30.477
Beau.

23:30.577 --> 23:31.978
What's in the dirt?

23:32.078 --> 23:34.346
Oh, uh, uh, asbestos.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.016
Well, there's no
asbestos in the house.

23:37.116 --> 23:38.017
Well, could it have come
from another house

23:38.117 --> 23:39.652
that was being worked on?

23:39.752 --> 23:41.488
Oh, that's doubtful. It was
a pretty high concentration.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.556
I might know where it came from.

23:43.656 --> 23:44.891
Hey.

23:46.292 --> 23:48.127
Can I have some room?
Yeah.

23:48.227 --> 23:50.396
I've been digging into Elliot
Painter's real estate business.

23:50.497 --> 23:51.998
Painter's wife
said he was cheap.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.466
Turns out he was
in trouble for it.

23:53.566 --> 23:54.901
What kind of trouble?

23:55.001 --> 23:56.302
Homeowners in one
of his developments

23:56.402 --> 23:57.937
say they were getting sick
because Painter

23:58.037 --> 23:59.506
didn't clear a toxic material
from the site.

23:59.606 --> 24:00.873
Asbestos.

24:00.973 --> 24:02.374
And some homeowners
held a demonstration

24:02.475 --> 24:04.376
two weeks ago in
front of Davis' house.

24:04.477 --> 24:08.515
My name is Carlo Rey.

24:08.615 --> 24:10.550
I'm a dead man.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.719
Elliot Painter killed me.

24:12.819 --> 24:14.320
He killed my wife.

24:14.420 --> 24:17.624
Poisoned us with
the ground under our home.

24:17.724 --> 24:19.892
So, I've brought
some of it here.

24:19.992 --> 24:23.462
And I say, shame on you.

24:25.364 --> 24:26.298
Shame.

24:26.398 --> 24:28.267
Shame! Shame! Shame!

24:29.368 --> 24:31.738
Mr. Rey is a chemical engineer.

24:31.838 --> 24:32.972
So, he knows phosphorous,

24:33.072 --> 24:34.273
and he's angry
at Elliot Painter.

24:34.373 --> 24:35.875
Guys, that sling
that he's wearing.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.144
Well, looks like
blue Nylon 6.

24:38.244 --> 24:40.813
Mm-hmm.
But he doesn't
look like Bigfoot.

24:40.913 --> 24:42.782
Maybe he knows him.

25:04.637 --> 25:07.273
Hello?
Mr. Rey?

25:07.373 --> 25:09.642
Yes? Yes.
Carlo Rey?

25:09.742 --> 25:11.177
Las Vegas Police, sir.

25:11.277 --> 25:12.745
Could you open
up the door, please?

25:12.845 --> 25:15.414
You'll have to wait.
I'm not dressed.

25:16.783 --> 25:17.950
I think you are, sir.

25:18.050 --> 25:19.218
Open up the door.

25:19.318 --> 25:21.453
Just a minute.

25:21.554 --> 25:23.355
He's running.

25:42.341 --> 25:44.376
Mr. Rey, this is absurd.

25:44.476 --> 25:45.878
Mr. Rey, stop.

25:45.978 --> 25:47.046
Stay there and keep
your hands in sight.

25:47.146 --> 25:48.247
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

25:48.347 --> 25:49.048
Okay, careful.

25:49.148 --> 25:50.182
Do I get medical?

25:51.584 --> 25:53.653
Mr. Rey, it's okay.

25:53.753 --> 25:55.788
Just breathe. I've got you.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.556
There's no reason to be afraid.

25:57.657 --> 26:00.292
Yes. Yes, there is.

26:00.392 --> 26:04.196
This is about him, isn't it?

26:12.238 --> 26:13.873
Are you feeling
any better, Mr. Rey?

26:13.973 --> 26:16.542
I have stage-four lung cancer
that's metastasized

26:16.643 --> 26:18.945
to my liver and brain.

26:19.045 --> 26:23.049
I have five months
to live, maybe.

26:23.149 --> 26:26.018
A little better, thanks.

26:26.118 --> 26:28.520
And you blame Elliot Painter
for your illness?

26:28.621 --> 26:31.423
Painter built
on hazardous waste.

26:31.523 --> 26:33.125
Then hired a fly-by-night
disposal company

26:33.225 --> 26:37.930
that didn't clear one-tenth
of what was there.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.199
He killed my wife.
He's killing me.

26:40.299 --> 26:42.568
He made my son sick.

26:42.669 --> 26:46.605
So, yes, I guess I do.

26:46.706 --> 26:48.140
You know Painter's dead?

26:48.240 --> 26:49.676
I heard that.

26:49.776 --> 26:52.845
Obviously, you didn't
want to talk to us about it.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.546
Why was that?
"Why"?

26:54.647 --> 26:57.116
You mean, did I kill him?

26:57.216 --> 27:00.319
Sure, I ran up and threw
some malignant cells on him.

27:00.419 --> 27:01.688
Are you serious?

27:01.788 --> 27:02.822
So, why did you run

27:02.922 --> 27:04.190
when we came to the door?

27:04.290 --> 27:06.458
I've said a lot
of things about Painter.

27:06.558 --> 27:08.494
I know how that
looks to the police.

27:08.594 --> 27:10.162
I got scared.

27:12.164 --> 27:14.466
I don't know
how many days I have left.

27:14.566 --> 27:16.468
I didn't want to
waste one of them

27:16.568 --> 27:18.671
in a room like this.

27:18.771 --> 27:19.939
Sir, you're here
because of a rally

27:20.039 --> 27:22.074
you held at
Davis Painter's house.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.475
Why hold it there?

27:23.575 --> 27:24.811
It's not where Elliot lives.

27:24.911 --> 27:27.213
Elliot's home is in
a gated community.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.948
Couldn't get there.

27:29.048 --> 27:31.250
It's a great way to scope out
a place before burning it down.

27:31.350 --> 27:32.351
Isn't it?

27:32.451 --> 27:33.786
If you say so.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.254
We'll need to
run some tests,

27:35.354 --> 27:36.689
take some DNA.

27:36.789 --> 27:39.125
I'll also need
a sample of this bag.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.293
I'm a human pincushion
these days.

27:41.393 --> 27:43.730
You can take whatever you want.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.631
That ain't Bigfoot.

27:45.732 --> 27:48.667
He's about two-thirds of one,
I'd say.

27:48.768 --> 27:50.002
Whoever did this had to crawl
under the house,

27:50.102 --> 27:51.838
dragging gallons of gasoline...

27:52.939 --> 27:53.940
Rey can barely walk.

27:54.040 --> 27:57.576
Let's see what the tests say.

28:08.921 --> 28:10.556
How long will this take?

28:10.656 --> 28:11.891
Not long.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.659
I just need to
run these next door.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.995
Can I get you
some more water?

28:16.095 --> 28:18.597
Can I get a little ibuprofen?

28:18.697 --> 28:20.232
I'm in some pain.

28:20.332 --> 28:23.135
Of course. I'll get some.

28:24.904 --> 28:26.338
I'm really sorry...

28:27.774 --> 28:29.275
...for what you've been through.

28:29.375 --> 28:32.044
It's-it's horrible.

28:32.144 --> 28:34.180
Ms. Rajan, is it?

28:35.114 --> 28:37.249
Thank you.

28:46.558 --> 28:47.760
Hi, excuse me?

28:47.860 --> 28:49.561
I'm looking for
my mom, Max Roby.

28:49.661 --> 28:51.630
You have any idea where she is?
Uh, no,

28:51.730 --> 28:53.966
but things are
kind of hopping around here.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.135
I-I don't know
where she is.
Okay, thanks.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.169
You're her son?

28:57.269 --> 28:59.338
Mm-hmm.
Ha! I'm Beau Finado.

28:59.438 --> 29:00.572
I'm new around here.

29:00.672 --> 29:01.908
Well, newish.

29:02.008 --> 29:03.976
I-I got to say,
I'm a huge fan of your mom's.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.812
She's been really
helpful to me.

29:05.912 --> 29:08.180
Just an outstanding boss.
You've got to be proud.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.548
Yeah.
And the way

29:09.648 --> 29:11.383
she came back from that assault.
It was amazing.

29:11.483 --> 29:13.085
When we were at the hospital,
there was a moment

29:13.185 --> 29:14.921
when I thought we'd lost her.

29:15.021 --> 29:16.889
I heard angels'
wings flapping.

29:16.989 --> 29:18.490
But then she beat it,
she came back.

29:18.590 --> 29:19.992
Your mom, your mom,
she's a rock.

29:20.092 --> 29:23.029
Yeah, a rock. Yeah.

29:23.896 --> 29:25.697
Listen, I'm going to go.

29:25.798 --> 29:28.400
If you see my mom,
could you tell her...

29:29.802 --> 29:31.370
Tell her whatever you want.

29:45.017 --> 29:48.420
Yeah, so, bad news.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.157
Ma'am?

29:52.458 --> 29:53.559
That's, oh...

29:53.659 --> 29:56.062
Oh, God, I am so sorry.

29:56.162 --> 29:57.296
I'm sorry, what?

29:57.396 --> 29:58.998
The, uh, DNA
from Carlo Rey

29:59.098 --> 30:02.634
isn't a match with
the sample we found on the ring.

30:02.734 --> 30:03.635
It's not his.

30:03.735 --> 30:05.337
No on DNA?

30:05.437 --> 30:06.505
No on DNA.

30:06.605 --> 30:07.773
Oh, we're oh-for-two then.

30:07.874 --> 30:09.375
The cloth sample
we took from Rey

30:09.475 --> 30:11.610
isn't the same material
as the thread from the house.

30:11.710 --> 30:13.012
But every piece of
DNA that we find

30:13.112 --> 30:14.413
says that Rey
didn't do it,

30:14.513 --> 30:15.547
and I'm just not
buying it.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.716
That man is way too small.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.385
And Bigfoot doesn't lie.

30:19.485 --> 30:20.419
Yeah?

30:20.519 --> 30:22.021
Well, I'll call Allie,

30:22.121 --> 30:23.589
tell her to cut him loose.

30:23.689 --> 30:25.291
You know what bugs me?
Hmm?

30:25.391 --> 30:27.426
Why put on the Bigfoot
costume at all?

30:27.526 --> 30:28.961
You want to
disguise yourself,

30:29.061 --> 30:30.396
put on a hoodie and a ballcap
like everyone else.

30:30.496 --> 30:31.797
It's simpler.

30:33.232 --> 30:35.034
Maybe, maybe not.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.279
Okay.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.454
Hey.
Oh, hey.

30:55.554 --> 30:56.956
I hear we're
cutting Rey loose.

30:57.056 --> 30:58.657
Puts us back at
square one.

30:58.757 --> 31:00.192
Yeah.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.194
Can we talk?

31:02.294 --> 31:04.430
Uh, okay.

31:12.038 --> 31:14.506
You said you would call
after dinner and you didn't.

31:14.606 --> 31:16.842
Oh, it was late.

31:16.943 --> 31:19.278
I had a few drinks
and went to bed.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.048
Is that what this is about?

31:22.148 --> 31:25.484
You didn't tell me the truth
about Jocelyn Lozando.

31:25.584 --> 31:27.653
Whoa, what do you mean?

31:27.753 --> 31:29.155
You told me you dated.

31:29.255 --> 31:31.357
You didn't say you
lived together for two years.

31:32.992 --> 31:34.360
How do you know that?

31:34.460 --> 31:35.427
I looked her up.

31:35.527 --> 31:36.495
You stalked her?

31:36.595 --> 31:38.497
All I did was
look her up.

31:38.597 --> 31:40.732
And for two years, her
home address was your apartment.

31:40.832 --> 31:43.002
You acted like you
went out a couple times.

31:43.102 --> 31:45.037
If you wanted to know
about our relationship,

31:45.137 --> 31:46.538
why didn't you just ask me
instead of going online?

31:46.638 --> 31:47.839
I don't know.

31:47.940 --> 31:49.275
Why weren't you honest with me

31:49.375 --> 31:51.010
in the first place?
You're upset

31:51.110 --> 31:53.445
because I had a serious
relationship with a woman?

31:53.545 --> 31:55.314
No.

31:55.414 --> 31:56.748
You just--

31:56.848 --> 31:59.885
You made it sound
like it was no big deal.

31:59.986 --> 32:01.187
And clearly it was.

32:01.287 --> 32:02.754
And now you're seeing her again.

32:02.854 --> 32:04.890
We had Chinese food
and touched base.

32:07.559 --> 32:09.261
She and her partner
are really serious.

32:10.963 --> 32:12.965
You think I would cheat?

32:16.969 --> 32:19.438
You don't know
anything about me.

32:37.589 --> 32:39.258
Mr. Rey. Yeah.

32:39.358 --> 32:40.359
You can go.

32:40.459 --> 32:43.295
I passed?
Yes.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.164
All right.

32:45.264 --> 32:49.201
Oh, um, thank you
for the ibuprofen.

32:49.301 --> 32:50.502
It helped.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.038
No problem.

32:52.138 --> 32:54.373
I hope you don't
take this wrong,

32:54.473 --> 32:56.775
but you remind me
of my wife a little.

32:56.875 --> 32:58.510
Why is that?

32:58.610 --> 33:00.179
She was kind, too.

33:00.279 --> 33:03.282
It's only been two months
since she passed,

33:03.382 --> 33:06.452
and I still feel like
she's with me.

33:08.020 --> 33:09.888
Right here.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.224
She's always right here.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.161
Every minute.

33:18.197 --> 33:21.033
Mr. Rey, I'm so sorry.
I've completely forgot.

33:21.133 --> 33:22.334
I need to fill out
some paperwork,

33:22.434 --> 33:24.670
to get you out of
here free and clear.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.372
I just need to...

33:26.472 --> 33:27.873
Excuse me.

33:29.808 --> 33:30.809
Thanks, man.

33:30.909 --> 33:32.211
Yo, Chris.

33:32.311 --> 33:34.446
I need to run the DNA
from the ring again.

33:45.191 --> 33:46.492
It's his wife.

33:46.592 --> 33:47.759
The DNA on the ring

33:47.859 --> 33:49.027
matches Carlo Rey's wife.

33:49.128 --> 33:50.162
It's hers.

33:50.262 --> 33:51.230
He must have
had it with him.

33:51.330 --> 33:52.664
Maybe around his neck?

33:57.403 --> 33:59.505
The ring isn't
proof he was there.

33:59.605 --> 34:01.407
And Rey is smart.
He'll never admit it.

34:01.507 --> 34:03.975
Plus, he's about
18 inches shy of Bigfoot.

34:04.076 --> 34:05.444
Yes, he is.

34:05.544 --> 34:06.645
That's Rey.

34:06.745 --> 34:07.946
There's no way
you can mistake him

34:08.046 --> 34:09.014
for whoever walked
out that door.

34:09.115 --> 34:11.049
Rey mentioned he had a son.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.118
What about him?

34:12.218 --> 34:13.652
I checked him out.

34:13.752 --> 34:15.020
His name's Michael Rey.

34:15.121 --> 34:16.988
He's at county being
treated for thyroid cancer,

34:17.089 --> 34:19.024
which is curable, I guess.

34:19.125 --> 34:20.759
Okay, so he's angry
at Painter, too.

34:20.859 --> 34:21.860
So, there is motive.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.028
Doesn't matter.

34:23.129 --> 34:24.330
He's an inch shorter
than his father.

34:24.430 --> 34:25.264
You know, something has
always bugged me

34:25.364 --> 34:27.233
about this Bigfoot video.

34:29.101 --> 34:30.769
His strides are too short.

34:30.869 --> 34:34.873
He is taking steps too small
for someone of his size.

34:34.973 --> 34:36.708
What does that mean?
Either he's in...

34:38.577 --> 34:42.181
Either he's injured
or he's carrying added weight.

34:42.281 --> 34:43.249
Like what?

34:43.349 --> 34:44.516
Like a person.

34:44.616 --> 34:46.285
That's why Rey
needed that costume.

34:46.385 --> 34:48.487
Not to cover him,
but to cover them.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.622
That's two people.
We can't prove it.

34:50.722 --> 34:52.524
Rey is never
going to give up his kid.

34:52.624 --> 34:55.026
Well, you said Michael Rey
has thyroid cancer. Yeah.

34:55.127 --> 34:56.895
Then we can prove it.
How?

34:56.995 --> 34:59.131
You'll see.

35:14.913 --> 35:16.282
You shouldn't be in here.

35:16.382 --> 35:17.483
Eh, that's okay, Michael.

35:17.583 --> 35:21.019
Listen, we're here
to talk about this.

35:23.455 --> 35:28.327
See, the good news about thyroid
cancer is that it's curable.

35:28.427 --> 35:31.062
The bad news is
radiation therapy

35:31.163 --> 35:33.365
makes you a little glowy, temporarily.

35:33.465 --> 35:34.666
Even your sweat
is radioactive.

35:34.766 --> 35:35.834
See, every time
you touch something,

35:35.934 --> 35:39.037
you leave a little
gamma ray smudge.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.672
So, we know
what you did.

35:40.772 --> 35:43.975
You and your father
crawled under the house.

35:49.315 --> 35:50.749
When Davis Painter got home,

35:50.849 --> 35:52.584
you must have forced him
to call his father

35:52.684 --> 35:54.085
and get him to come over.

35:55.086 --> 35:56.655
<i>Then you strapped them down,</i>

35:56.755 --> 35:58.324
<i>wrapped Davis' head...</i>

36:00.826 --> 36:04.230
<i>...and Elliot was forced
to watch his son die.</i>

36:04.330 --> 36:06.965
Then you set your ignition.

36:09.435 --> 36:11.337
And made your escape.

36:15.241 --> 36:17.643
None of that's true.
Here's the thing.

36:17.743 --> 36:19.611
Your dad will never
live until the trial.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.780
A confession might
get you both bail.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.515
He could die at home.

36:23.615 --> 36:24.516
If neither of you

36:24.616 --> 36:25.784
show any remorse,

36:25.884 --> 36:28.287
or accept responsibility,

36:28.387 --> 36:30.589
I'd wager bail gets denied.

36:31.357 --> 36:32.591
Michael,

36:32.691 --> 36:34.826
your father will die in a cell.

36:39.498 --> 36:42.100
No. He shouldn't
have done that.

36:44.636 --> 36:46.572
What if I say it was my idea?

36:46.672 --> 36:48.807
It was.
I talked him into it.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.409
Will that help him?

36:50.509 --> 36:53.445
Is there anything I
can say that will help him?

36:53.545 --> 36:55.547
I don't think so.

36:55.647 --> 36:58.750
I understand that you were
angry with Elliot Painter.

36:58.850 --> 37:00.252
I get it.

37:00.352 --> 37:01.953
But, as a father,

37:02.053 --> 37:04.890
how could you kill his son?

37:04.990 --> 37:07.158
He hadn't done anything to you.

37:07.259 --> 37:12.197
My wife died because
cancer filled her lungs.

37:13.164 --> 37:15.801
I watched her drown in bed.

37:17.135 --> 37:20.272
I wanted Painter
to know that feeling.

37:20.372 --> 37:22.408
To witness that.

37:23.709 --> 37:25.844
He burned my family.

37:27.045 --> 37:29.315
Burned them out of existence.

37:31.683 --> 37:33.885
So I burned his.

I wasn't trying

37:57.943 --> 38:00.612
there just wasn't time

Sometimes that's when people
get second thoughts.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.363
That's not what this is.

39:26.498 --> 39:28.800

put in the hospital
and nearly died.

40:04.035 --> 40:05.203
Did that happen?

40:05.303 --> 40:06.772
Yes.

40:07.873 --> 40:09.875
And I didn't tell you because I
didn't want you to worry, okay?

40:09.975 --> 40:11.777
Oh, you didn't want me to worry?

40:11.877 --> 40:13.144
Bryan, you have got
your own life.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.813
I don't want to
go pulling on your sleeve

40:14.913 --> 40:16.247

happens to me.

40:16.347 --> 40:18.083
I'm fine.
The doctors took care of me.

40:18.183 --> 40:20.852
I am fine. Really.

40:20.952 --> 40:23.855
Mom, please do not lie to me.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.696
I can't sleep.

40:30.796 --> 40:32.498
Like not at all.

40:32.598 --> 40:33.799
I get in the bed,

40:33.899 --> 40:36.735
and then I--
and then I just start...

40:36.835 --> 40:39.404
I start thinking about it.

40:53.184 --> 40:55.420
You have to take
some time off from work.

40:55.521 --> 40:58.456
Work's the only thing that's
holding me together, baby.

40:59.491 --> 41:02.027
Okay, so here's
what we're going to do.

41:02.127 --> 41:03.729
I'm going to stay here
for a little while.

41:03.829 --> 41:05.130
Bryan, you don't
have to do that.

41:05.230 --> 41:06.498
I'm going to stay here
for a little while,

41:06.598 --> 41:07.899
and I'm going to make sure

41:07.999 --> 41:09.768
that when you are home,
you get some rest.

41:09.868 --> 41:11.069
And I'll make the meals.

41:11.169 --> 41:12.638
And I'll clean.

41:13.672 --> 41:15.373
You going to clean?

41:16.608 --> 41:18.209
Yeah, I'm-a clean.

41:18.309 --> 41:19.845
And we can watch <i>House Hunters.</i>

41:19.945 --> 41:21.747
You hate <i>House Hunters.</i>

41:21.847 --> 41:22.881
Yeah, I do.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.883
But it's your favorite.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.417
Okay?

41:27.553 --> 41:29.054
Okay.

41:30.288 --> 41:31.723
All right, you lay down.

41:31.823 --> 41:34.059
And close your eyes
for a little bit.

41:34.159 --> 41:36.127
Come on.
Lay down.

41:44.169 --> 41:46.504
Okay. I'm going
to go see

41:46.605 --> 41:48.607
what you got in the
kitchen, all right?
Okay.

41:59.317 --> 42:01.386
Okay, so for tonight,
I'm thinking

42:01.486 --> 42:04.656
the best option is
definitely takeout.
