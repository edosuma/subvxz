WEBVTT

02:03.891 --> 02:04.725
Ma'am.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.961
Wonder if I might trouble
you for a hot meal

02:08.061 --> 02:09.863
and a hitch for my horse?

02:09.963 --> 02:11.532
Well, sure.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.167
My husband takes great delight

02:13.267 --> 02:16.069
in my ministerin' to random
desperados.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.577
Your husband needs a bath.

02:23.677 --> 02:26.146
Oh yes, he does.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.181
Daddy?

02:27.281 --> 02:28.115
Hope.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.385
I thought you'd never get
home.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.953
Is it good news, Jeremiah?

02:33.954 --> 02:35.088
As good as it gets.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.328
Mmm. Smells good.

02:40.428 --> 02:43.431
Well, don't you clean up nice.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.499
Nothing like a few nights in
the rough

02:45.599 --> 02:48.035
to make you appreciate
the creature comforts.

02:48.135 --> 02:48.936
Don't get too comfortable.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.070
We're still short some birds.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.106
Hey, guests arrive at five,

02:53.207 --> 02:55.843
and the butcher's still open for
an hour.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.345
- Butcher?
- Yeah, butcher.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.080
What do you think I am?

03:00.180 --> 03:01.782
I mean, I don't know.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.251
Come on, Hope.

03:03.351 --> 03:07.087
No, no, in this house, the
women cook and the men hunt.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.224
Now, Martha darling, you
know she's my lucky star.

03:12.226 --> 03:13.160
All right, fine.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.796
But you best return overladen
with grouse.

03:15.896 --> 03:16.797
I intend to.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.476
Look for 'em, Track.

03:30.143 --> 03:30.978
High on.

03:40.388 --> 03:41.221
Picks and axes.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.023
No cussing, daddy.

03:43.123 --> 03:44.224
Ah, it was hardly a cuss.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.394
It was close enough.

03:46.494 --> 03:47.328
My turn.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.898
Now you remember our deal,
you speak a word of this.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.466
My lips are sealed.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.401
Now hand it over.

03:58.439 --> 03:59.440
Track, heel.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.218
High on, Track.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.063
Hunt dead, Track.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.666
Don't you go cussing, now.

04:27.435 --> 04:28.736
If my congregation finds out

04:28.836 --> 04:31.271
that my daughter's a
natural-born gunslinger,

04:31.372 --> 04:32.640
I'll never live it down.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.508
It's our secret, I promise.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.410
Now just three more.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.682
Ma'am, pardon the intrusion.

05:14.782 --> 05:15.849
Is the mister at home?

05:16.850 --> 05:18.085
May I help you?

05:18.185 --> 05:19.319
More likely,

05:20.621 --> 05:21.622
I can help you.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.396
Allow me to introduce myself.

05:29.363 --> 05:32.533
My name is Jebediah Goodnight,

05:32.633 --> 05:35.436
the sole licensed
purveyor of Mr. Stanley's

05:35.536 --> 05:38.839
wondrous cure-all rattlesnake
elixir.

05:41.141 --> 05:46.146
Now Mr. Stanley, he spent sacred
time with Hopi medicine men

05:46.814 --> 05:48.315
who revealed to him the secret

05:49.650 --> 05:51.685
of this wondrous potion.

05:53.487 --> 05:58.492
Synthesized from the sweet fat
of the Western rattlesnake,

05:58.859 --> 06:02.663
our elixir is guaranteed
to cure all that ails you.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.132
Mr. Goodnight.

06:07.267 --> 06:10.471
if I was of the mind to
imbibe rattlesnake juice,

06:10.571 --> 06:12.540
I'd simply squeeze one myself.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.845
Ah, look, there comes my husband
now.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.349
I thank you kindly all the
same.

06:22.450 --> 06:23.817
You have a good day.

06:28.856 --> 06:29.990
- Ma'am.
- Mm-hm.

06:45.305 --> 06:46.707
Here.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.275
What is it?

06:48.375 --> 06:49.209
Open it.

06:50.644 --> 06:51.612
Come here, Track.

07:05.292 --> 07:06.560
Daddy, it's beautiful.

07:15.736 --> 07:16.670
Like it?

07:16.770 --> 07:18.138
It looks nice.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.073
Thank you.

07:20.941 --> 07:21.775
Come on, Track.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.713
Why are you staring?

07:26.980 --> 07:29.149
I was just thinking how you're

07:29.249 --> 07:30.651
looking more like your mama.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.961
Do you ever...

07:41.495 --> 07:44.231
regret staying in Last Chance?

07:45.833 --> 07:48.235
Like maybe you were.

07:49.336 --> 07:50.771
born for something bigger?

07:53.006 --> 07:55.576
Well Hope, it's not about
the places you've been.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.847
It's about learning to make
the most of where you're at.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.481
Daddy, that's mama talking.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.585
Now you just hold it right
there.

08:05.485 --> 08:09.757
I'll be first to admit, your
mama can be opinionated,

08:09.857 --> 08:10.791
Mmhmmm

08:10.891 --> 08:13.927
but she didn't have an easy
life.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.597
I knew that when I married her.

08:19.767 --> 08:22.369
Two trees growing side by side,

08:23.704 --> 08:24.938
well, they never meet up.

08:26.206 --> 08:29.810
Two blades of grass,
well, they sway a little.

08:29.910 --> 08:30.744
Give and take.

08:31.945 --> 08:35.515
Marriage is a promise to
stand firm when it's right.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.720
and to bend when it's necessary.

08:41.121 --> 08:44.925
But you always, you always stand
together.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.195
Yeah.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.129
Someday,

08:50.463 --> 08:53.533
maybe you'll find a man that's
willing to stand with you,

08:53.634 --> 08:55.035
as pigheaded as you are,

08:56.704 --> 08:58.572
and the life you guys build
together,

09:00.273 --> 09:03.276
maybe it's bigger than
you ever dreamed of.

09:11.451 --> 09:12.786
Yeah, right over there.

09:13.821 --> 09:14.655
That's nice.

09:16.356 --> 09:17.224
Oh.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.292
Nice place for a meeting.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.566
Afternoon, gentlemen.

09:26.667 --> 09:30.037
Hope your day has been as
amentiferous as my own.

09:30.137 --> 09:30.971
Well?

09:32.405 --> 09:33.674
Cut to the chase.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.044
I see you are an eager man,

09:38.345 --> 09:42.549
not a trait that usually
compliments the outlaw life.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.718
But to answer your
almost-a-question,

09:45.686 --> 09:48.521
I have indeed identified your
prize.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.227
That means I saw her.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.496
You sure it was her?

09:56.596 --> 09:59.332
With a 99% certainty,

09:59.432 --> 10:03.070
the remaining 1% reserved
out of a spirit of humility.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.775
Was she alone?

10:10.878 --> 10:11.912
Not hardly.

10:14.014 --> 10:14.848
There's a girl,

10:16.549 --> 10:19.252
a spitting spitfired image,

10:19.352 --> 10:23.290
and a man, a parson by the looks
of him.

10:23.390 --> 10:24.224
Parson?

10:25.959 --> 10:26.960
Smart girl.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.131
Thinks she found her sanctuary.

10:33.566 --> 10:37.971
And now, it is the customary
time to remit payment.

10:41.975 --> 10:42.810
Go ahead, kid.

10:51.885 --> 10:52.886
It's all there.

10:54.054 --> 10:54.988
Now where is she?

10:55.756 --> 10:56.589
Ah.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.600
On that map, you will find
coordinates

11:07.701 --> 11:09.903
and suggested roots of egress,
ingress,

11:10.003 --> 11:13.273
and points advantageous to
surveillance.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.208
All at no additional charge.

11:18.345 --> 11:21.715
And now, I shall bid you
farewell.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.817
I've a bounty to collect in
Tucson.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.724
Goodnight, why didn't you just
take her

11:30.824 --> 11:32.259
while you had the chance?

11:33.560 --> 11:35.362
Mighty big bounty for one fella.

11:44.037 --> 11:44.905
That's simple.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.540
I'm not insane.

11:49.910 --> 11:50.911
I didn't think so.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.222
I'm of a general opinion
that double-crossing

12:02.322 --> 12:03.590
is bad for business.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.393
Well,

12:06.493 --> 12:07.527
I am sorry.

12:08.695 --> 12:10.597
But you see, we can't take any
chances.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.100
You're up, kid.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.403
Now you should be honored.

12:16.503 --> 12:17.637
It's his first time.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.018
I prefer a steadier hand.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.122
My apologies, Mr. Goodnight.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.624
It is what it is.

12:48.701 --> 12:52.305
How many times I told you
kid, you dither, you die.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.353
What is this world coming to?

13:58.838 --> 14:00.173
We've been standing
here for over half an age

14:00.273 --> 14:01.942
and you haven't said a word to
me.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.478
Either I'm that ugly or I'm so
beautiful,

14:05.578 --> 14:06.746
I've stricken you dumb.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.418
Well Reverend,

14:11.518 --> 14:14.221
are you going to keep us
in suspense all night?

14:15.688 --> 14:18.125
May I have your attention,
please?

14:18.225 --> 14:20.760
Thank all of you for coming,
this special occasion.

14:21.761 --> 14:22.695
Let's get right to it.

14:22.795 --> 14:24.864
"To my brothers and sisters in
Christ."

14:24.965 --> 14:26.599
"After a prayerful consideration

14:26.699 --> 14:30.303
and close consultation with
Reverend Jacobs," that's me,

14:31.404 --> 14:34.141
"the Central Christian
Conference has hereby decided

14:34.241 --> 14:36.276
to allocate the necessary funds

14:36.376 --> 14:40.313
for the construction of a
church in Last Chance, Arizona,

14:40.413 --> 14:42.950
and to officially assign
Reverend Jacobs

14:43.050 --> 14:44.784
as its permanent rector."

14:44.884 --> 14:46.153
We did it, folks.

14:47.955 --> 14:49.422
It's been a long time coming.

14:50.290 --> 14:53.093
You've done a good thing
for these people, Reverend.

14:54.594 --> 14:57.597
A place like this could
turn sour real quick.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.901
It's a testimony to you
that it hasn't already.

15:03.870 --> 15:05.939
Now these are good people,
Sheriff.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.240
Even still.

15:10.710 --> 15:13.846
the town's made by its
church or its saloon.

15:15.715 --> 15:17.350
Now we got a fighting chance.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.555
Papa, don't fall asleep yet.

15:23.523 --> 15:26.226
Mm, just resting my eyes,
dear.

15:26.326 --> 15:29.029
That's what you always say
before you start snoring.

15:34.834 --> 15:35.835
Come on, now.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.271
Okay, okay, okay.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.273
Read to us.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.909
Do I have to?

15:43.010 --> 15:45.412
Well, Track hasn't
learned yet so, you're it.

15:45.512 --> 15:46.713
Okay, fine, fine.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.116
Let's see.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.084
Where were we?

15:55.688 --> 15:56.956
"Forsake her not,

15:57.924 --> 15:59.259
and she shall preserve thee."

15:59.359 --> 16:01.528
"Love her, and she shall keep
thee."

16:02.529 --> 16:04.431
"Enter not into the path of the
wicked,

16:04.531 --> 16:07.600
and go not in the way of evil
men,

16:08.935 --> 16:10.903
for they eat the bread of
wickedness

16:11.004 --> 16:13.606
and drink the wine of
violence."

16:13.706 --> 16:15.242
"For they sleep not,

16:15.342 --> 16:17.610
except they have done mischief,

16:17.710 --> 16:19.179
and their sleep is taken away

16:19.279 --> 16:21.681
unless they cause someone to
fall."

16:50.410 --> 16:52.945
Wonder what raised his hair?

16:57.050 --> 16:57.884
Track.

17:06.992 --> 17:07.727
Track!

17:08.928 --> 17:09.762
Track.

17:10.896 --> 17:12.165
Get inside.

17:12.265 --> 17:13.633
What? Why?

17:13.733 --> 17:16.969
If you have ever trusted
me or loved me, trust me now.

17:17.069 --> 17:18.471
Get inside.

17:31.084 --> 17:31.851
Daddy, what's wrong?

17:34.020 --> 17:34.754
Martha?

17:34.854 --> 17:36.089
Hope, get upstairs.

17:38.591 --> 17:39.926
Martha, what's going on?

17:40.026 --> 17:42.562
Hope, upstairs, right now.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.767
Do what she says.

17:47.867 --> 17:48.701
Hide.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.390
Daddy!

18:59.572 --> 19:03.376
Did you forget, Rose?
The house always wins.

19:10.650 --> 19:11.784
Daddy!

19:13.853 --> 19:14.987
Mama!

19:15.087 --> 19:16.323
Hope!

19:35.342 --> 19:36.175
Martha.

19:37.877 --> 19:38.778
What is happening?

19:44.584 --> 19:46.085
Hold your britches.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.695
I said, hold your britches.

20:02.635 --> 20:03.470
Reverend?

20:07.206 --> 20:08.708
Can you think of any reason

20:08.808 --> 20:10.543
why these men would come for
Hope?

20:13.079 --> 20:14.414
A secret beau, maybe?

20:16.916 --> 20:18.618
She ain't got a beau, Sheriff.

20:18.718 --> 20:19.552
Hmm.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.855
This is just odd.

20:22.955 --> 20:25.792
I've seen ransom, revenge, and
romance,

20:25.892 --> 20:28.828
but I've never seen random.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.434
If there is something you're not
saying.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.571
anything at all that can help
us,

20:40.139 --> 20:41.741
could save your daughter's life.

20:44.477 --> 20:46.413
Did they say anything?

20:49.181 --> 20:50.016
Any clues?

20:53.586 --> 20:55.288
They said "the house always
wins."

21:00.627 --> 21:01.561
The House Gang.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.096
The what?

21:04.196 --> 21:06.433
The House Gang.

21:06.533 --> 21:08.768
The lowest, dirtiest.

21:11.237 --> 21:15.642
most unholy batch of
cold-blooded dry gulch sidewinders

21:15.742 --> 21:16.609
this side of Hades.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.077
Their ringleader,

21:19.579 --> 21:23.483
William Bridges, AKA King of
Hearts.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.818
During the war, he was a union
chaplain

21:25.918 --> 21:28.120
in the New York 35th.

21:28.220 --> 21:30.289
After Antietam he just went
crazy, though.

21:31.358 --> 21:33.125
He found his wife slaughtered,

21:33.225 --> 21:34.994
then his daughter disappeared,

21:35.094 --> 21:37.630
and the House Gang became his
church.

21:37.730 --> 21:40.667
They swore a blood oath to his
allegiance,

21:40.767 --> 21:43.903
leaving a trail of crime
and chaos across the west,

21:44.737 --> 21:47.374
which leads me to wonder.

21:49.108 --> 21:53.380
Why would the House Gang
come to Last Chance?

21:54.414 --> 21:57.784
Why would they want Hope?

21:59.452 --> 22:00.286
And--

22:04.857 --> 22:06.125
Sheriff.

22:07.727 --> 22:08.661
Martha.

22:10.697 --> 22:12.665
Do not move that hand.

22:14.133 --> 22:17.837
Sheriff, if I wanted to kill
you, you'd already be dead.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.343
I am so sorry.

22:26.479 --> 22:29.215
My name is Rose Bridges.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.885
I am a fugitive from justice.

22:34.587 --> 22:38.224
William the King of Hearts
Bridges is my father.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.761
I am willing to surrender myself

22:41.861 --> 22:44.764
without caveat or
reservation except for one.

22:44.864 --> 22:45.698
Sheriff,

22:46.766 --> 22:49.368
you and I will go and rescue
Hope.

22:51.003 --> 22:53.673
Look, I know their ways.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.207
I know their movements.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.243
I know how to find her.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.280
And when we have brought her
safely home,

23:02.449 --> 23:04.484
I will remand myself to your
custody.

23:08.488 --> 23:09.321
Please.

23:10.457 --> 23:11.624
Sheriff, please.

23:13.159 --> 23:14.293
It's her only chance.

23:18.330 --> 23:19.165
Look.

23:21.668 --> 23:22.502
In good faith.

23:23.836 --> 23:24.671
Okay?

23:30.443 --> 23:31.010
Plea--

23:32.378 --> 23:36.516
Rose Bridges, by authority
of the territory of Arizona,

23:37.450 --> 23:38.585
I place you under arrest.

23:38.685 --> 23:39.519
Billy.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.522
She said in good faith.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.457
Good faith, my foot.

24:00.006 --> 24:02.241
I cannot tell you how sorry I
am.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.244
She played you for a fool.

24:09.315 --> 24:11.551
On the off chance that they come
back,

24:12.919 --> 24:14.587
maybe looking for your missus.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.829
When are you gonna go get my
daughter?

24:25.064 --> 24:26.966
I can't take on a criminal
gang,

24:27.066 --> 24:29.001
let alone the House Gang, on my
own.

24:30.402 --> 24:33.339
Well then, we'll have to form
a posse.

24:34.507 --> 24:36.509
Posse takes men, Reverend.

24:37.510 --> 24:39.846
Where are you gonna get
men in Last Chance?

24:42.582 --> 24:44.951
Well, you and I'll have
to ride together then.

24:48.521 --> 24:49.689
All due respect,

24:51.691 --> 24:53.993
you're not somebody I'd
choose to ride out with.

24:54.093 --> 24:56.262
All due respect to myself,

24:56.362 --> 24:58.364
anyone I would choose to ride
out with

24:58.464 --> 25:01.568
would not choose to ride out
with me.

25:08.074 --> 25:10.276
What I'm saying, Parson,

25:11.443 --> 25:12.278
go on home,

25:13.412 --> 25:15.548
ask Providence to lend a hand.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.688
Best thing you can do right now
is pray.

25:38.571 --> 25:42.208
Billy, can't you do anything
for him?

25:42.308 --> 25:43.442
I already did.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.613
I told him the truth.

26:39.866 --> 26:40.700
Lord.

26:44.036 --> 26:45.872
I know I'm not supposed to test
You.

26:49.842 --> 26:51.577
So if You know another way.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.184
now's the time to suggest it.

27:30.717 --> 27:32.651
I believe I said my piece.

27:40.026 --> 27:40.860
I prayed.

27:42.461 --> 27:43.295
Go on.

27:50.469 --> 27:51.203
You may want to
consider

27:51.303 --> 27:52.805
this course of action, Preacher.

27:54.974 --> 27:55.808
Open it.

27:56.909 --> 28:00.279
No, Jeremiah, this isn't the
way.

28:00.379 --> 28:01.748
Now listen to her.

28:01.848 --> 28:03.149
There is no other way.

28:04.416 --> 28:05.985
Open it.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.253
I don't have the keys.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.056
Ma'am, easy.

28:10.156 --> 28:12.591
Bonnie, do something,
now talk some sense.

28:16.829 --> 28:17.663
Billy.

28:18.597 --> 28:19.431
He's right.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.903
Someone's gotta go after that
little girl.

28:25.071 --> 28:27.006
Don't you dare.

28:27.106 --> 28:30.910
You do anything to help them,
and I will--

28:31.010 --> 28:32.644
Close that up.

28:32.745 --> 28:33.612
Close that.

28:38.785 --> 28:39.618
Sheriff.

28:41.253 --> 28:43.689
You're the only chance I
got to save my daughter.

28:46.192 --> 28:49.762
Sheriff Beauchamp, please,

28:49.862 --> 28:53.099
please, I beg you, we
can go together, please.

29:03.175 --> 29:05.344
If I cross this threshold,

29:05.444 --> 29:08.580
there's no going back, for
either of us.

29:11.417 --> 29:12.251
I know it.

29:39.378 --> 29:40.612
We need guns.

29:53.259 --> 29:54.393
That's aidin' and abettin'.

29:54.493 --> 29:56.228
You could arrest me later,
dear.

31:48.607 --> 31:50.409
Everything in here

31:50.509 --> 31:52.811
is exactly the way it
was the day she left.

31:55.081 --> 31:58.650
I've had my men set this up
day after day for 15 years.

32:01.587 --> 32:04.190
praying every day that
one day she would return.

32:06.192 --> 32:07.893
For 15 long years,

32:09.861 --> 32:10.729
I have felt it.

32:13.865 --> 32:15.734
a cognate heart beating,

32:17.003 --> 32:20.372
keeping time as if it were my
very own.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.444
What is your name, child?

32:27.746 --> 32:28.480
Hope.

32:28.580 --> 32:29.415
Hope?

32:31.383 --> 32:32.551
Who are you?

32:34.086 --> 32:36.288
My blood flows through your
veins,

32:37.723 --> 32:38.624
through your heart.

32:39.591 --> 32:40.792
It's an inheritance.

32:42.528 --> 32:45.797
I am William Bridges, King of
Hearts.

32:49.368 --> 32:50.402
I'm your grandfather.

33:14.826 --> 33:17.363
Wait, whoa whoa.

33:17.463 --> 33:18.297
What's that?

33:36.548 --> 33:37.983
Good Girl, Hope.

33:38.084 --> 33:40.552
Good girl, she left it
for us, I know she did.

33:40.652 --> 33:41.987
We're on the right trail.

33:42.088 --> 33:43.989
How do we know he'll still be
there?

33:44.823 --> 33:46.325
Because he knows I'm coming.

33:49.195 --> 33:52.231
Jeremiah, you don't have to do
this.

33:53.099 --> 33:55.501
My life is already ruined,
yours doesn't have to be.

33:55.601 --> 33:57.636
Look, just go home.

33:57.736 --> 33:59.471
I will go after her,
I will bring her back,

33:59.571 --> 34:01.240
and then you never have
to see me ever again.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.241
Don't!

34:03.109 --> 34:05.911
No, you don't get to
set the terms, Martha.

34:07.813 --> 34:09.681
Look, I gotta go save my
daughter.

34:11.350 --> 34:13.085
You're just gonna slow me
down.

34:14.353 --> 34:15.420
Well then teach me.

34:16.288 --> 34:18.023
Teach me what I need to know.

34:21.627 --> 34:23.495
This life's gonna break your
heart.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.699
Can't break what's already
been broken.

35:05.804 --> 35:06.638
Ma'am.

35:07.573 --> 35:09.975
Your grandfather requests the
honor

35:10.075 --> 35:13.745
of the pleasure of your
society for a morning repast.

35:15.080 --> 35:16.482
A, a morning what?

35:18.116 --> 35:18.950
Chow time.

35:22.288 --> 35:23.989
All right.

35:24.089 --> 35:25.090
All right.

35:49.114 --> 35:50.582
If today we meet our
fortune.

35:50.682 --> 35:52.318
So be it.

35:52.418 --> 35:54.019
If today we meet our
doom.

35:54.119 --> 35:55.053
So be it.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.923
May we face our fate
with eyes wide open.

35:58.757 --> 35:59.825
So be it.

35:59.925 --> 36:02.394
As shameless as the first
outlaws in the garden,

36:02.494 --> 36:06.732
freely united, unencumbered
by vow or covenant.

36:06.832 --> 36:07.766
So be it.

36:07.866 --> 36:08.767
And death.

36:11.503 --> 36:12.804
if we shall part.

36:12.904 --> 36:14.172
So be it.

36:14.273 --> 36:15.106
So be it.

36:20.579 --> 36:25.284
This chair has been empty
since the Queen of Hearts,

36:25.384 --> 36:30.155
my daughter Rose, left us many
years ago.

36:30.256 --> 36:35.193
And today I present this chair
to my granddaughter, Hope.

36:37.563 --> 36:39.197
No, I, I wanna go home.

36:40.632 --> 36:42.634
Darling, you are home.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.305
And as soon as your mother
returns,

36:46.405 --> 36:48.039
we will be a family again.

36:48.139 --> 36:49.040
Family?

36:50.476 --> 36:51.710
You kidnapped me.

36:54.546 --> 36:55.681
Now you better take me back
right now

36:55.781 --> 36:57.549
before my father gets here with
the law.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.385
Your father is dead.

36:59.485 --> 37:00.319
You lie.

37:01.487 --> 37:02.454
I know he's alive.

37:02.554 --> 37:03.989
Not that imposter.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.126
I mean your real father.

37:15.367 --> 37:16.302
Go on.

37:16.402 --> 37:17.235
Yes sir.

37:24.075 --> 37:24.910
Bonnie?

37:27.212 --> 37:28.614
Bonnie, I'm going.

37:28.714 --> 37:29.981
Good riddance.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.250
Oh now, come on.

37:32.351 --> 37:33.652
Don't be like that.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.987
Don't let me ride off to my
possible doom

37:36.087 --> 37:38.223
without so much as a kiss.

37:44.830 --> 37:47.032
Sandwiches, cheese, and a slab
of bacon.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.701
I hope you like it.

37:51.069 --> 37:51.903
Bonnie.

37:57.343 --> 37:59.945
Rather than hunt those folks
down,

38:00.045 --> 38:02.147
why can't you help get Hope
back?

38:02.247 --> 38:06.685
I aim to help them, by
saving them from themselves.

38:06.785 --> 38:09.721
The best thing I can do for
those people

38:09.821 --> 38:11.423
is bring them into custody

38:11.523 --> 38:13.859
so they can't effectuate their
own demise.

38:15.026 --> 38:19.297
If those men took me,
would you feel the same?

38:20.298 --> 38:22.233
What would they want you for?

38:22.334 --> 38:23.168
Fine.

38:25.337 --> 38:26.237
You can just forage.

38:26.338 --> 38:29.140
Bonnie, in spite of their
misfortune,

38:30.308 --> 38:32.711
she is a known criminal.

38:32.811 --> 38:33.679
Reformed.

38:33.779 --> 38:35.614
They assaulted a duly elected
sheriff.

38:35.714 --> 38:37.082
That was hardly an assault.

38:37.182 --> 38:38.183
They stole my favorite horse.

38:38.283 --> 38:39.317
Borrowed.

38:41.687 --> 38:44.556
Dang, woman! I got a duty
here.

38:46.392 --> 38:48.360
Right or wrong,

38:48.460 --> 38:50.662
the law is the law.

38:52.230 --> 38:53.164
Help them.

38:54.032 --> 38:55.467
Help them if you can, Billy.

38:56.968 --> 38:58.069
I'll do what I can.

39:19.124 --> 39:19.958
Go away.

39:23.094 --> 39:24.262
I said go away.

39:30.335 --> 39:32.037
Mighty good arm.

39:32.137 --> 39:34.372
Your grandfather'd be right
proud.

39:34.473 --> 39:35.841
You should have nabbed one of
the horses,

39:35.941 --> 39:38.109
it would've made for a
more exciting escape.

39:39.578 --> 39:40.512
I don't know how to ride.

39:41.112 --> 39:42.013
What?

39:42.481 --> 39:43.214
Stop it.

39:44.483 --> 39:46.418
I said stop it.

39:46.518 --> 39:48.053
Doesn't know how to ride a
horse?

39:48.153 --> 39:49.588
Don't laugh at me.

39:49.688 --> 39:51.590
Now, what is so funny?

39:51.690 --> 39:53.892
Rose Bridges' daughter doesn't
know how to ride a horse?

39:53.992 --> 39:56.862
Child, your mama's been breaking
broncos since she was six.

39:56.962 --> 39:59.865
She said that galloping
around on horses was unladylike.

39:59.965 --> 40:02.367
Yeah, well no one accused
her of being a lady.

40:02.468 --> 40:03.502
She is a lady.

40:06.805 --> 40:08.339
Well, she is now anyway.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.476
Oh, don't, don't do that.

40:18.617 --> 40:21.186
It's true what he said
about my father, isn't it?

40:23.054 --> 40:26.091
The King of Hearts said
it, it's most likely true.

40:26.191 --> 40:27.358
Yeah, but he's.

40:29.695 --> 40:30.962
he's an outlaw.

40:31.062 --> 40:32.464
He's a thief.

40:32.564 --> 40:34.365
And he'd be the first to admit
it.

40:39.505 --> 40:41.306
Why didn't he just leave us
alone?

40:43.141 --> 40:45.711
Well, that'd be like asking
the sun

40:45.811 --> 40:47.713
why it don't just let the Earth
wander?

40:50.081 --> 40:51.783
Your mama she, she was,

40:51.883 --> 40:53.585
she is the Queen of Hearts.

40:55.020 --> 40:56.922
That's not something you can
just quit.

40:59.825 --> 41:01.226
Well, what if you try?

41:08.166 --> 41:11.002
Come on, I wanna show you
something.

41:11.102 --> 41:12.838
Hmm?

41:12.938 --> 41:14.840
Hope, I promise I'd never hurt
you.

41:16.407 --> 41:17.242
You can trust me.

41:33.291 --> 41:34.125
These men,

41:35.260 --> 41:36.995
they as good as you are with a
gun?

41:37.996 --> 41:39.631
More than likely, I'm rusty.

41:42.167 --> 41:45.436
My own experience is limited
to grouse and squirrels.

41:47.372 --> 41:48.840
Well, we best rectify that.

41:59.050 --> 42:01.386
Sh sh, here she comes.

42:03.722 --> 42:05.156
Oh,

42:05.256 --> 42:06.391
they're so cute.

42:08.126 --> 42:11.129
Yeah, I found 'em the other
day.

42:11.229 --> 42:13.331
Hawk was going after the mama
but

42:13.431 --> 42:14.432
I fixed him good.

42:16.702 --> 42:18.536
Oh, they're gonna make a great
stew.

42:20.305 --> 42:21.306
You wouldn't dare.

42:22.641 --> 42:23.742
I've eaten cuter.

42:37.055 --> 42:38.590
Hope shot all those grouse.

42:39.557 --> 42:40.425
Every one of them.

42:42.628 --> 42:47.198
All right, look, shooting
is about intention.

42:47.298 --> 42:48.299
Okay, you gotta,

42:48.399 --> 42:49.868
you gotta know where you
want your bullet to go.

42:49.968 --> 42:51.402
You gotta feel it.

42:51.502 --> 42:52.337
Fate it.

42:56.241 --> 42:57.275
That cactus there.

42:58.910 --> 43:00.445
Pretend it's your sworn enemy.

43:08.754 --> 43:10.221
Hang on, hang on, stay fluid.

43:11.657 --> 43:12.490
Look.

43:15.426 --> 43:16.294
That's it.

43:18.396 --> 43:19.230
Okay.

43:24.269 --> 43:25.370
Hold your neck easy.

43:27.706 --> 43:29.174
If you tense up, you
feel yourself tense up,

43:29.274 --> 43:30.608
it's 'cause you're trying
to shoot from your mind,

43:30.709 --> 43:33.779
but shootin' isn't about
the mind, it's about here.

43:36.682 --> 43:39.217
Shoot from the heart, and
you'll always shoot true.

43:51.196 --> 43:52.030
All right,

43:52.964 --> 43:53.799
try again.

44:03.108 --> 44:05.176
That's good.

44:05.276 --> 44:07.112
Biscuits and gravy.

44:20.558 --> 44:22.327
I'm still your wife, Jeremiah.

44:25.163 --> 44:26.531
My wife's name was Martha.

44:59.664 --> 45:00.498
Pay up.

45:05.136 --> 45:06.504
Double or nothing?

45:06.604 --> 45:09.374
Well, you done broke the bank
already.

45:09.474 --> 45:13.011
Hey, why don't we make this
wager a little more interesting.

45:24.455 --> 45:25.590
So what's the wager?

45:28.326 --> 45:31.429
How's about a kiss?

45:34.265 --> 45:37.602
Oh, well what would I get if I
win?

45:39.204 --> 45:40.105
Two kisses.

45:41.672 --> 45:42.607
No.

45:43.608 --> 45:45.076
That's no kind of bet.

45:45.176 --> 45:48.780
Well, as your grandpa
says, the house always wins.

45:50.681 --> 45:51.616
Hmm.

45:51.883 --> 45:53.551
Well not today, I ain't playing.

45:55.854 --> 45:56.687
Fine.

45:59.490 --> 46:00.458
You win.

46:00.859 --> 46:01.692
Mm hmm?

46:03.194 --> 46:04.896
You get anything you ask for.

46:07.565 --> 46:08.399
Promise?

46:09.534 --> 46:11.102
Cross my heart.

46:11.202 --> 46:12.037
Deal.

46:30.621 --> 46:31.556
Beat that.

46:31.656 --> 46:33.524
You swear you never
shot a pistol before?

46:33.624 --> 46:36.394
No, my mama would tan my hide.

46:36.494 --> 46:38.063
Don't you start laughing again.

46:39.464 --> 46:41.232
I don't laugh at a lady with a
gun.

46:46.071 --> 46:47.338
All right, stand back now.

46:57.482 --> 46:58.349
Even Steven.

47:05.723 --> 47:07.658
You were letting me win.

47:09.928 --> 47:10.761
So, uh,

47:12.530 --> 47:13.698
how about that wager?

47:16.367 --> 47:17.202
Oh.

47:18.403 --> 47:19.504
Hey.

47:19.604 --> 47:20.505
Oh.

47:20.605 --> 47:21.772
That's not fair.

47:37.755 --> 47:38.723
All these people.

47:41.259 --> 47:43.794
how did they all end up being.

47:46.264 --> 47:47.966
How did you end up being the--

47:48.066 --> 47:49.567
No need to be delicate.

47:51.302 --> 47:52.337
Criminals.

47:52.437 --> 47:53.271
Yeah.

47:56.374 --> 47:57.208
I mean.

47:59.110 --> 48:01.212
don't you know right from wrong?

48:03.048 --> 48:05.616
Well, your grandfather says
that

48:05.716 --> 48:08.086
everyone's born the way they
are.

48:08.186 --> 48:09.454
He calls it a birthright.

48:11.056 --> 48:13.458
Some people in the world, they
want to try and change it,

48:13.558 --> 48:14.759
but they can't.

48:14.859 --> 48:17.295
Instead you just gotta embrace
it.

48:17.395 --> 48:18.229
You see him?

48:19.797 --> 48:21.199
That's Royal Flush.

48:21.299 --> 48:24.902
Now he used to be a chemist
making medicine and such.

48:25.003 --> 48:29.407
He mixed the wrong ingredients
one time, killed some people.

48:29.507 --> 48:32.143
Now it was an accident,
but he still went to jail.

48:32.243 --> 48:34.779
When he got out, no one would
hire him.

48:34.879 --> 48:36.247
Your grandfather found him
facedown

48:36.347 --> 48:37.848
in a gutter in Kansas City.

48:39.985 --> 48:42.553
And that there, that's Joker's
Wild.

48:44.055 --> 48:46.157
He used to work on the railway.

48:46.257 --> 48:49.294
A few years back there was a
strike.

48:49.394 --> 48:51.229
A couple of men burned down
the camp he was living in,

48:51.329 --> 48:52.597
killed his wife and child.

48:54.732 --> 48:56.767
King of Hearts, your granddad,

48:57.702 --> 48:59.004
found him in an opium den.

49:01.506 --> 49:03.641
Oh, and Ace of Spades there.

49:04.942 --> 49:07.612
Well, he's been with your
grandfather since the beginning.

49:08.679 --> 49:10.615
He doesn't like to talk about
his past,

49:12.150 --> 49:13.118
about the war.

49:15.186 --> 49:19.190
But sometimes I hear
him screaming at night.

49:22.293 --> 49:23.128
And, uh.

49:25.997 --> 49:28.166
what about you?

49:34.605 --> 49:35.640
I was an orphan.

49:36.674 --> 49:38.543
So no one ever gave me a second
thought

49:38.643 --> 49:40.211
except maybe to spit on me.

49:41.312 --> 49:44.515
Except, except the King of
Hearts.

49:46.717 --> 49:50.888
He saw something in me that
no one else really did and.

49:53.191 --> 49:56.061
well he, he, treats me like
family.

49:59.697 --> 50:04.302
Well, that's the only family
the Diamond Kid's ever had.

50:08.839 --> 50:10.041
What's your real name?

50:12.677 --> 50:14.312
The Diamond Kid.

50:14.412 --> 50:15.413
No your.

50:17.348 --> 50:18.249
your real name.

50:24.355 --> 50:26.491
On the night that I
joined the House Gang,

50:26.591 --> 50:27.658
and I took that oath.

50:30.595 --> 50:35.100
your granddad said that
I was shedding my skin

50:36.101 --> 50:39.470
and I was reborn a new man.

50:39.570 --> 50:41.606
And now my old life and my
name and everything with it

50:41.706 --> 50:42.707
was dead and buried.

50:44.542 --> 50:47.578
So my name's the Diamond
Kid, and that's that.

51:05.296 --> 51:07.098
It's time I heard the whole
story.

51:09.033 --> 51:09.867
everything.

51:11.669 --> 51:13.438
Some things are best laid
buried.

51:17.608 --> 51:18.876
You're a stranger to me.

51:21.479 --> 51:23.281
The only thing that matters is
Hope.

51:26.384 --> 51:28.018
And the more I know about my
enemy,

51:29.954 --> 51:32.056
the better chance I have at
defeating him.

51:40.398 --> 51:41.532
My first memory,

51:42.833 --> 51:44.369
I swear it,

51:44.469 --> 51:47.705
is of my father helping
me pull the trigger

51:47.805 --> 51:48.873
on a Colt Peacemaker.

51:51.542 --> 51:52.910
My mother was already dead.

51:55.546 --> 51:56.647
By the time I was ten,

51:56.747 --> 51:58.783
my name was written in every
lawman's book

51:58.883 --> 52:01.252
from Kansas City to Albuquerque.

52:02.653 --> 52:03.554
Hope?

52:09.960 --> 52:13.564
You are cordially invited to
the greatest show on Earth.

52:15.065 --> 52:17.935
Protestations from Mr. P. T.
Barnum notwithstanding.

52:20.971 --> 52:23.441
Please do not embarrass
me in front of my people.

52:29.314 --> 52:32.016
And the crazy thing is

52:32.116 --> 52:33.251
my father never made it seem
like

52:33.351 --> 52:35.520
there was anything strange
about us being outlaws.

52:35.620 --> 52:36.454
And it was just,

52:38.022 --> 52:40.090
just another way of life, like
any other.

52:41.792 --> 52:44.495
His world was exciting.

52:46.764 --> 52:47.632
romantic.

52:51.135 --> 52:53.904
But there was something in me
that knew

52:54.004 --> 52:58.175
that no matter how normal
William made it seem.

53:00.511 --> 53:03.414
there was this small voice

53:04.682 --> 53:06.451
telling me there was something
better.

53:11.856 --> 53:12.957
When I was 15,

53:14.058 --> 53:15.793
a man joined our camp.

53:15.893 --> 53:19.297
I mean, I say man, but
he was, he was a boy,

53:21.131 --> 53:22.300
and I was just a girl.

53:25.270 --> 53:29.274
Soon I was, I was in a motherly
way.

53:32.310 --> 53:35.713
and, and something in me
shifted.

53:38.316 --> 53:43.153
I, I'd never cared for anything
before,

53:43.254 --> 53:46.457
really cared.

53:46.557 --> 53:47.892
But this child inside me.

53:50.261 --> 53:51.095
I could feel her.

53:52.930 --> 53:54.332
her little heart beating.

53:55.766 --> 53:58.569
And I knew that I had to
protect her, whatever the cost.

54:01.506 --> 54:03.874
My father had arranged
the romance, of course,

54:03.974 --> 54:06.477
as easy as another man might
breathe.

54:06.577 --> 54:10.014
He had just taken two
hearts and made 'em one.

54:12.483 --> 54:14.385
He was ensuring his legacy.

54:15.853 --> 54:19.990
And I just couldn't, I
could not let that happen.

54:22.660 --> 54:25.496
The boy promised to
help me, and we escaped.

54:25.596 --> 54:26.564
But my father.

54:30.568 --> 54:31.802
So you have--

54:31.902 --> 54:34.605
you have to understand
that we all took a vow,

54:35.940 --> 54:37.074
like a wedding vow.

54:38.743 --> 54:40.110
Leaving meant death.

54:42.747 --> 54:44.048
even for his own daughter.

54:47.518 --> 54:50.287
They hunted us down and they
found us.

54:51.856 --> 54:52.690
And the boy.

54:55.960 --> 54:58.629
they killed him, and I got away.

55:00.698 --> 55:03.267
When you found me, I was half
dead.

55:05.870 --> 55:07.872
How my child survived is a
miracle.

55:10.140 --> 55:11.842
God saw fit to spare her,

55:12.943 --> 55:14.712
and for some reason to spare me
too.

55:26.457 --> 55:27.291
I am,

55:28.726 --> 55:31.896
I am sorry, Jeremiah.

55:34.699 --> 55:35.533
I, I.

55:38.035 --> 55:39.303
I wish it were different.

55:42.540 --> 55:44.875
I didn't know how to tell you
the truth.

55:44.975 --> 55:46.276
It wasn't something I ever
learned,

55:46.377 --> 55:47.878
and then when I did, it was.

55:50.881 --> 55:52.149
it was too late.

55:58.656 --> 56:00.024
Why couldn't you trust me?

56:01.358 --> 56:02.259
To tell me?

56:09.467 --> 56:10.401
Did you not care for me--

56:10.501 --> 56:11.836
No.

56:11.936 --> 56:14.171
- Jeremiah.
- Don't, Rose.

56:14.271 --> 56:15.105
Don't,

56:16.441 --> 56:17.307
I know you needed

56:18.676 --> 56:19.510
a sanctuary.

56:22.447 --> 56:23.781
and I was it.

56:25.783 --> 56:30.788
When you found me, yes, I
was scared and I was alone.

56:31.321 --> 56:34.659
But I saw in you that thing that
I knew

56:35.693 --> 56:36.527
in my heart,

56:38.162 --> 56:40.665
that love from beyond.

56:43.100 --> 56:44.802
And I knew you had it, that,

56:46.937 --> 56:47.772
that impossible thing.

56:47.872 --> 56:49.607
You, Jeremiah,

56:50.975 --> 56:52.443
you gave it a name.

56:55.646 --> 56:56.481
That

56:57.715 --> 56:59.149
fiery love.

57:01.285 --> 57:02.186
God's love.

57:03.120 --> 57:04.254
I knew that it wasn't from you.

57:04.354 --> 57:08.025
I knew that it was in
you, and I just wanted it.

57:10.027 --> 57:12.697
I wanted it so badly.

57:18.268 --> 57:20.037
Can you blame me?

57:23.040 --> 57:24.609
That you, of all people.

57:33.250 --> 57:35.620
If I had told you the
truth from the beginning.

57:38.055 --> 57:41.125
could your heart have ever loved
one as

57:42.493 --> 57:45.229
wounded and thorn-struck is
mine?

57:52.436 --> 57:54.138
Could you have made me your
wife?

58:16.360 --> 58:17.194
Diamond?

58:23.668 --> 58:24.501
I feel like.

58:28.438 --> 58:30.274
everything I knew was burned to
ash.

58:33.611 --> 58:35.780
You know, like you said
with, with your name.

58:39.249 --> 58:40.585
And the real me,

58:40.685 --> 58:41.518
she was just,

58:43.220 --> 58:44.254
she was always there.

58:45.355 --> 58:46.356
She was just hiding.

58:48.458 --> 58:50.027
just waiting to come out.

58:52.730 --> 58:53.564
But.

58:55.600 --> 58:56.701
now that she's here I.

59:00.938 --> 59:02.239
I don't know who I am.

59:07.845 --> 59:09.313
I don't know who I really am.

59:10.681 --> 59:14.484
Well, maybe we can figure that
out.

59:16.553 --> 59:17.955
together.

59:30.567 --> 59:31.535
Rose Bridges.

59:33.503 --> 59:34.338
Jeremiah?

59:37.374 --> 59:39.409
Hold it right there, Parson.

59:47.151 --> 59:48.819
My name is Jebediah Goodnight.

59:50.254 --> 59:51.822
We met briefly before,

59:53.523 --> 59:55.425
regrettably under false
pretenses.

59:57.762 --> 59:58.863
I am a bounty hunter.

01:00:00.064 --> 01:00:02.767
I tracked you under
contract for your father,

01:00:02.867 --> 01:00:03.834
a William Bridges.

01:00:05.402 --> 01:00:07.337
However, he breached that
contract,

01:00:08.205 --> 01:00:10.074
and now I aim to collect the
legal bounty

01:00:10.174 --> 01:00:11.241
on your head instead.

01:00:12.576 --> 01:00:14.945
I prefer to bring you both in
dead.

01:00:15.045 --> 01:00:18.215
However, because I am a
Christian man,

01:00:19.684 --> 01:00:20.918
I will give you a choice.

01:00:22.352 --> 01:00:26.090
Surrender peacefully,
or I will be forced to kill you both.

01:00:29.193 --> 01:00:32.797
As is my custom, I will give
you five seconds to decide.

01:00:35.933 --> 01:00:36.667
What are we gonna do?

01:00:36.767 --> 01:00:38.102
That was one.

01:00:38.202 --> 01:00:40.938
I don't know, he's got us
pinned.

01:00:41.038 --> 01:00:41.772
Two.

01:00:41.872 --> 01:00:42.840
We can make a run for it.

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:43.674
Three.

01:00:43.774 --> 01:00:45.876
Can't outrun bullets.

01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:46.944
Four.

01:00:48.779 --> 01:00:49.146
Hang on.

01:00:49.246 --> 01:00:50.080
Five.

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:50.881
I've got an idea, throw me
your hat.

01:00:51.615 --> 01:00:52.549
What? Why?

01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:53.751
Just do it.

01:00:54.885 --> 01:00:56.453
By your lack of formal
surrender,

01:00:56.553 --> 01:00:59.824
I can only assume you have
chosen to go down fightin'.

01:01:00.825 --> 01:01:04.695
Understand that I take no
personal offense to your decision.

01:01:11.401 --> 01:01:12.469
He's up on the ridge.

01:01:12.569 --> 01:01:13.804
Stay down.

01:01:13.904 --> 01:01:16.941
I also want you
to have my personal commitment.

01:01:17.041 --> 01:01:18.876
I will do my utmost to dispatch
you

01:01:18.976 --> 01:01:20.444
in the most expedient way
possible.

01:01:20.544 --> 01:01:21.946
Here.

01:01:22.046 --> 01:01:24.381
Preferably with a shot
to the head or the heart.

01:01:29.086 --> 01:01:33.157
Jeremiah, when I say go,
you run for that boulder.

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:38.328
In the unlikely event you
gain the advantage of me,

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:42.566
I would politely ask that
you do me the same good turn.

01:01:47.604 --> 01:01:48.605
Go!

01:02:04.021 --> 01:02:05.255
Well played!

01:02:07.925 --> 01:02:10.928
It might also interest you
to know my weapon of choice

01:02:11.028 --> 01:02:12.629
is a Henry repeater,

01:02:13.663 --> 01:02:16.433
which served me well in the
War of Northern Aggression.

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:18.836
I acquired it from a Yankee,

01:02:20.771 --> 01:02:21.605
who was

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:25.009
no longer in need of it.

01:02:48.398 --> 01:02:49.366
I have enough provisions

01:02:49.466 --> 01:02:51.802
to keep me in food and
drink for many days.

01:02:59.243 --> 01:03:01.645
And in alternate circumstances,

01:03:01.745 --> 01:03:04.281
I would have loved to have
broken bread with you.

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:46.924
Don't move, Mr. Goodnight.

01:03:50.427 --> 01:03:52.796
Gun down and hands up.

01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:15.852
Reverend, I don't
think you have the guts.

01:04:40.644 --> 01:04:41.478
Martha?

01:04:55.425 --> 01:04:56.260
Rose?

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:22.586
Rose!

01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:53.950
Ma'am, I must admit
to a change of plans.

01:05:56.120 --> 01:06:00.424
In a moment of capricious
sentimentality,

01:06:00.524 --> 01:06:02.626
I thought to bear you alive to
Tucson.

01:06:03.727 --> 01:06:05.495
But I regret to inform you,

01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:08.865
it is clear that it is
not worth the trouble.

01:06:10.267 --> 01:06:11.768
Do you have any last words?

01:06:54.311 --> 01:06:57.314
Reverend, what have
you got yourself into?

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:54.964
Whoa.

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:52.988
Jeremiah.

01:09:53.089 --> 01:09:54.189
You're alive.

01:09:55.792 --> 01:09:56.960
I'm impressed.

01:10:32.796 --> 01:10:36.466
"He makes me lie
down in green pastures."

01:10:37.301 --> 01:10:40.036
"He leads me beside quiet
waters."

01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:03.092
"Therefore, we will fear no
evil."

01:11:04.528 --> 01:11:07.564
".though the earth shakes, and
the mountains

01:11:07.664 --> 01:11:09.232
slip into the heart of the
sea."

01:11:10.734 --> 01:11:13.937
"The LORD is near the
broken-hearted,

01:11:15.238 --> 01:11:19.175
and He saves those who
are crushed in spirit."

01:11:26.015 --> 01:11:26.850
Just rest.

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:33.289
In the darkness,

01:11:35.258 --> 01:11:36.593
I heard a sound.

01:11:38.862 --> 01:11:40.364
It was a heartbeat

01:11:41.531 --> 01:11:42.799
calling me back.

01:11:48.037 --> 01:11:49.539
It was your heart.

01:12:39.055 --> 01:12:40.490
They're coming.

01:12:42.659 --> 01:12:43.927
How many?

01:12:44.027 --> 01:12:46.430
Just her, and her husband.

01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:52.436
You go and tell Diamond to
take Hope out of the camp.

01:13:17.427 --> 01:13:19.095
I've been running from this
place,

01:13:19.996 --> 01:13:21.631
from him, for half my life.

01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:26.369
Now that I'm back, I
feel like I never left.

01:13:29.606 --> 01:13:31.775
I feel like I'm home.

01:13:38.147 --> 01:13:39.716
We have to get her out of there.

01:13:40.383 --> 01:13:41.518
How, Rose?

01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:47.356
Play his game better than he
does.

01:13:50.494 --> 01:13:51.561
We move at nightfall.

01:14:13.617 --> 01:14:15.519
Welcome home, Rose.

01:14:15.619 --> 01:14:16.886
Hello father.

01:14:19.756 --> 01:14:21.725
15 years with a
preacher, and you're still

01:14:21.825 --> 01:14:23.326
as quick on the draw as I am.

01:14:23.426 --> 01:14:24.828
Oh, that warms my heart.

01:14:24.928 --> 01:14:25.962
Cover the entrance.

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.068
Why don't you stay put,
Reverend?

01:14:37.974 --> 01:14:39.042
Where is she?

01:14:39.142 --> 01:14:39.976
She's safe.

01:14:42.145 --> 01:14:43.246
A bit disappointed.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.582
Truth be told,

01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:47.917
she's heartbroken.

01:14:49.753 --> 01:14:51.187
If you hurt her--

01:14:51.287 --> 01:14:53.356
I have done nothing to hurt
that child

01:14:53.456 --> 01:14:55.592
except tell her the truth,

01:14:55.692 --> 01:14:57.961
something you two are incapable
of doing.

01:14:59.663 --> 01:15:01.397
Now put your guns down.

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:02.899
Give me my daughter back.

01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:06.169
I'm sorry, did someone
steal your daughter from you?

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:09.205
I can't imagine how that must
feel.

01:15:17.547 --> 01:15:18.381
Diamond.

01:15:19.749 --> 01:15:23.086
I know that I didn't win the
bet, but,

01:15:23.186 --> 01:15:25.589
and I know this isn't fair to
ask you, but

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:29.993
you promised me that you'd give
me

01:15:30.093 --> 01:15:32.161
anything I want if I win.

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:33.096
Did you mean it?

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:35.699
I did.

01:15:37.066 --> 01:15:38.067
All right, then.

01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:41.938
Could we bet again?

01:15:50.079 --> 01:15:50.914
Call it.

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:54.884
Heads.

01:15:59.455 --> 01:16:00.289
Diamond?

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:02.626
I just wanna go home.

01:16:11.534 --> 01:16:12.135
No, no, no.

01:16:12.235 --> 01:16:13.269
I'm sorry, Hope.

01:16:13.369 --> 01:16:15.471
No, you have to take me back,
okay?

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:16.539
I can't.

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:17.774
Why not?

01:16:17.874 --> 01:16:18.808
I just can't.

01:16:18.908 --> 01:16:21.344
Tell me, Diamond,
tell me why not, please!

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:25.514
The King of Hearts.

01:16:28.051 --> 01:16:29.585
He said your mother was coming.

01:16:40.529 --> 01:16:41.665
Sorry.

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:45.368
I'm sorry.

01:16:47.536 --> 01:16:49.005
Now what's to become of us?

01:16:50.573 --> 01:16:52.075
You shoot me, I'll shoot you,

01:16:52.175 --> 01:16:54.443
my men shoot him several times.

01:16:55.912 --> 01:16:57.981
Now is that any way for an
intelligent group of people

01:16:58.081 --> 01:16:59.615
to settle a disagreement?

01:17:00.516 --> 01:17:01.517
We all die?

01:17:04.921 --> 01:17:06.723
I don't think so,

01:17:06.823 --> 01:17:08.357
especially with family.

01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:11.327
Especially with Hope.

01:17:13.663 --> 01:17:14.664
I agree.

01:17:16.032 --> 01:17:17.200
You have a proposal?

01:17:19.035 --> 01:17:19.568
I do.

01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:20.804
Propose.

01:17:28.812 --> 01:17:30.513
I'm sorry.

01:17:30.613 --> 01:17:31.447
Rose.

01:17:33.316 --> 01:17:35.785
If you let my husband
and my daughter go free,

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:38.755
I'll be your Queen of Hearts
again.

01:17:38.855 --> 01:17:41.124
You'll stay, free and clear?

01:17:41.224 --> 01:17:42.859
So be it.

01:17:42.959 --> 01:17:45.261
You will
accept your birthright?

01:17:45.361 --> 01:17:46.095
So be it.

01:17:46.195 --> 01:17:47.030
No.

01:17:48.798 --> 01:17:51.534
Reverend, I want to ask you a
question,

01:17:51.634 --> 01:17:53.536
and please answer me honestly.

01:17:55.304 --> 01:17:57.774
Were you unaware of her past?

01:17:57.874 --> 01:17:58.708
I was.

01:17:59.976 --> 01:18:03.479
Your marriage was
defunct from the beginning.

01:18:05.715 --> 01:18:07.483
Now you can end this nightmare.

01:18:09.452 --> 01:18:14.323
All you have to do is disavow
this lyin', treacherous woman.

01:18:15.725 --> 01:18:16.559
Say it.

01:18:17.994 --> 01:18:19.162
I disavow her.

01:18:20.063 --> 01:18:20.797
Say it!

01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:29.038
Tell him, Rose.

01:18:29.138 --> 01:18:31.240
You have to Jeremiah, it's the
only way.

01:18:38.314 --> 01:18:39.148
Rose.

01:18:43.486 --> 01:18:47.857
you asked me if I knew the
truth, if I'd have married you?

01:18:51.795 --> 01:18:54.363
I can't say what I
would've done then, but.

01:18:57.366 --> 01:19:01.137
I'd marry you now, this instant.

01:19:03.306 --> 01:19:07.176
She's my wife, and that's that.

01:19:08.044 --> 01:19:09.612
You can choose to let us all go.

01:19:15.885 --> 01:19:18.154
That I cannot do.

01:19:18.254 --> 01:19:21.424
Her birthright is my legacy.

01:19:21.524 --> 01:19:24.360
My bloodline needs its queen.

01:19:25.561 --> 01:19:28.965
And you, sir, are standing in
the way.

01:19:33.269 --> 01:19:35.038
Daddy? Mama?

01:19:38.374 --> 01:19:39.876
Until death do you part.

01:19:49.886 --> 01:19:50.719
Hope.

01:19:52.388 --> 01:19:53.622
This is all your fault.

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:57.961
None of this would've happened,

01:19:58.061 --> 01:20:00.096
if you would've just told me the
truth.

01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:06.402
Yes, I know.

01:20:10.406 --> 01:20:11.407
He's dead.

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:14.143
isn't he?

01:20:46.142 --> 01:20:50.213
When Jeremiah found
me, you were just a baby.

01:20:52.515 --> 01:20:56.452
And you know, I hadn't
given you a name yet because.

01:20:59.055 --> 01:21:00.823
I didn't know if you would
survive.

01:21:03.026 --> 01:21:04.193
And I couldn't bear it.

01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:08.197
I thought,

01:21:09.765 --> 01:21:11.234
if I have to lose her,

01:21:12.735 --> 01:21:13.536
I will.

01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:18.241
Can't lose her if she has a
name.

01:21:24.313 --> 01:21:25.148
And then.

01:21:27.150 --> 01:21:28.317
he found us.

01:21:30.453 --> 01:21:33.957
and he asked me what your name
was, and I didn't answer and,

01:21:34.057 --> 01:21:36.993
and somehow he knew why.

01:21:38.928 --> 01:21:40.796
He knew what I'd been thinking.

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:45.068
He just, he knew that secret in
my heart.

01:21:48.304 --> 01:21:51.207
And he took one look at you,

01:21:51.307 --> 01:21:52.341
and he said,

01:21:54.143 --> 01:21:57.646
"This child's name is Hope."

01:22:00.783 --> 01:22:01.617
And I knew

01:22:02.986 --> 01:22:03.819
right then

01:22:04.954 --> 01:22:07.856
that everything was gonna be
okay.

01:22:09.658 --> 01:22:10.893
I knew that this man

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:14.063
had a faith that I,

01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:19.235
I had always felt but I
didn't have a name for.

01:22:22.671 --> 01:22:24.873
I mean, his heart was just
overflowing

01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:27.843
with God's love.

01:22:32.215 --> 01:22:33.449
And I knew that

01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:37.853
no matter what, no matter what I
had done,

01:22:39.188 --> 01:22:40.123
I could start over.

01:22:43.692 --> 01:22:46.429
My past could be unwritten.

01:22:55.604 --> 01:22:57.373
It's gonna be okay.

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:07.550
It'll all be better.

01:23:52.095 --> 01:23:53.229
I must say,

01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:58.434
mighty surprised to see you
hanging around these parts.

01:24:00.903 --> 01:24:04.107
Horse thievin', five years.

01:24:04.773 --> 01:24:09.312
Assaultin' a peace officer,
that would be me, seven years.

01:24:10.179 --> 01:24:13.682
Stealin' said peace
officer's guns, five years.

01:24:13.782 --> 01:24:18.787
Stealin' said peace officer's
vittles, nine months.

01:24:19.088 --> 01:24:20.823
Jail breakin', ten years.

01:24:20.923 --> 01:24:23.759
Murder, victim being a bounty
hunter

01:24:23.859 --> 01:24:26.229
named Jebediah Goodnight,

01:24:26.329 --> 01:24:27.630
one hanging.

01:24:28.464 --> 01:24:29.498
So now let me see.

01:24:30.699 --> 01:24:31.967
Carry the one.

01:24:33.202 --> 01:24:38.207
We got a minimum 27 and three
quarter years, plus a hanging.

01:24:41.544 --> 01:24:44.213
I'm not going to argue with
you about what I've done.

01:24:45.648 --> 01:24:46.782
We can still save 'em.

01:24:47.816 --> 01:24:51.554
Reverend, my advice, you
remain silent.

01:24:52.455 --> 01:24:56.192
You have sorely tested
what little faith I had.

01:24:59.162 --> 01:25:00.496
What deviltry?

01:25:03.699 --> 01:25:06.269
Stranger, identify yourself

01:25:06.369 --> 01:25:09.405
before I send you a hot lead
telegram.

01:25:11.707 --> 01:25:12.808
Billy Beauchamp.

01:25:12.908 --> 01:25:13.976
Bonnie?

01:25:18.614 --> 01:25:19.448
Rose?

01:25:20.783 --> 01:25:21.617
It's time.

01:25:22.818 --> 01:25:24.086
Time for what?

01:25:25.421 --> 01:25:27.190
Justice.

01:25:52.915 --> 01:25:54.917
If today we meet our
fortune,

01:25:55.951 --> 01:25:57.753
if today we find our doom,

01:25:59.488 --> 01:26:00.789
then we face our fate,

01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:03.259
with eyes wide open,

01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:05.361
and death

01:26:07.162 --> 01:26:08.264
if we shall part.

01:26:09.698 --> 01:26:10.866
What are you gonna do to her?

01:26:10.966 --> 01:26:14.803
I'm gonna give your mother
what she always dreamed of,

01:26:14.903 --> 01:26:15.738
her freedom.

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:20.276
One day child, you will
understand.

01:26:21.610 --> 01:26:25.414
Tonight, the Queen of Hearts
must die.

01:26:26.515 --> 01:26:28.517
And the Queen of Spades will be
born.

01:26:28.617 --> 01:26:29.452
No.

01:26:30.419 --> 01:26:31.487
I won't join you.

01:26:31.587 --> 01:26:34.056
You have no choice, child,
it's your birthright.

01:26:40.696 --> 01:26:41.530
Rose.

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:45.801
William, no.

01:26:46.902 --> 01:26:48.170
Sir, this ain't right.

01:26:48.271 --> 01:26:49.538
Kid!

01:26:51.374 --> 01:26:52.375
It is what it is.

01:26:52.475 --> 01:26:54.142
Well I've had enough of it!

01:27:04.453 --> 01:27:05.354
William?

01:27:09.292 --> 01:27:10.326
My real name,

01:27:12.194 --> 01:27:13.362
is Dylan.

01:27:20.569 --> 01:27:21.570
He loved you.

01:27:24.507 --> 01:27:25.341
William!

01:27:27.042 --> 01:27:28.877
William Bridges!

01:27:28.977 --> 01:27:30.045
This is over!

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.061
Hope?

01:27:47.596 --> 01:27:49.097
Hope?

01:27:49.197 --> 01:27:50.265
Hope!

01:27:50.366 --> 01:27:51.934
Mama!

01:27:54.503 --> 01:27:56.071
Mama!

01:28:02.177 --> 01:28:03.446
Come here!

01:28:06.315 --> 01:28:07.149
Hope?

01:28:09.518 --> 01:28:10.353
Rose.

01:28:11.754 --> 01:28:12.588
Jeremiah.

01:28:17.593 --> 01:28:18.794
Daddy!

01:28:22.931 --> 01:28:24.132
Daddy!

01:28:24.333 --> 01:28:25.267
Jeremiah?

01:28:27.803 --> 01:28:29.104
Jeremiah!

01:28:34.610 --> 01:28:36.345
Daddy!

01:28:36.445 --> 01:28:37.713
No, Grandpa, don't!

01:29:16.452 --> 01:29:18.220
Shoot me!

01:29:45.848 --> 01:29:48.684
My daughter, she
teach you how to shoot?

01:29:49.952 --> 01:29:52.120
Then you know the secret.

01:29:52.688 --> 01:29:55.190
Shoot true, and I die.

01:29:56.291 --> 01:29:58.794
You don't, she dies.

01:29:59.962 --> 01:30:01.864
Don't listen to him, Daddy.

01:30:01.964 --> 01:30:04.399
He's just trying to make
you as low as he is.

01:30:11.206 --> 01:30:12.641
You shoot true.

01:30:22.451 --> 01:30:24.887
Father. Father, father.

01:30:31.293 --> 01:30:35.864
Rose, you will always
be my Queen of Hearts.

01:32:14.429 --> 01:32:16.398
You may be seated.

01:32:21.269 --> 01:32:22.971
Jeremiah, Martha Rose,

01:32:24.206 --> 01:32:26.541
"Remember not the former
things."

01:32:26.642 --> 01:32:29.444
"Behold I am doing something
new."

01:32:29.945 --> 01:32:32.514
"I will make a way in the
wilderness,

01:32:32.615 --> 01:32:34.116
rivers in the desert."

01:32:35.818 --> 01:32:39.287
"If anyone is in Christ,

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:41.423
he is a new creation."

01:32:42.324 --> 01:32:44.259
"The old has passed away

01:32:45.961 --> 01:32:47.562
and a new has come."

01:32:50.165 --> 01:32:53.168
Now I cannot join together

01:32:53.268 --> 01:32:56.338
that what God already did.

01:32:56.438 --> 01:32:58.641
But I can make it legal

01:32:58.741 --> 01:33:01.009
in the eyes of the Arizona
territory.

01:33:03.078 --> 01:33:06.048
Do you take this man, Jeremiah,

01:33:06.148 --> 01:33:08.483
to be your lawfully wedded
husband?

01:33:09.752 --> 01:33:10.585
I do.

01:33:11.887 --> 01:33:15.590
And do you take
this woman, Martha Rose,

01:33:15.691 --> 01:33:18.326
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

01:33:23.331 --> 01:33:24.166
I sure do.

01:33:27.535 --> 01:33:29.137
Well, don't take all
day, it's your wife,

01:33:29.237 --> 01:33:30.105
you can kiss her.

01:33:59.367 --> 01:34:00.602
Really sorry, darling.

01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:03.238
You're gonna get yourself

01:34:04.973 --> 01:34:07.943
a nine-month holiday in Tucson.

01:34:15.784 --> 01:34:17.019
Nine months.

01:34:17.119 --> 01:34:19.354
It'll go by in a heartbeat.

01:34:23.025 --> 01:34:23.959
Reverend.

01:34:39.041 --> 01:34:41.309
Stand firm, Hope.

01:34:41.409 --> 01:34:42.244
I will.

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:50.105
* There are parts of me
I've tried to hide *

01:36:51.073 --> 01:36:56.078
* I thought there wasn't
room under the light *

01:36:57.112 --> 01:36:59.547
* Ran away to find a place

01:36:59.647 --> 01:37:03.886
* I didn't have to face it

01:37:03.986 --> 01:37:09.057
* Thought that I would
never be worth saving *

01:37:09.824 --> 01:37:14.762
* But You called my name

01:37:15.363 --> 01:37:21.503
* And I knew I couldn't run from
grace *

01:37:21.904 --> 01:37:27.876
* You love me as deep as the
ocean *

01:37:28.210 --> 01:37:31.013
* And all You ask *

01:37:31.113 --> 01:37:34.482
* Is for me to keep holding

01:37:34.582 --> 01:37:37.485
* Onto Your right hand

01:37:37.585 --> 01:37:42.590
* You give me the strength to
stand *

01:37:43.791 --> 01:37:49.431
* Steady, sure as the mountains
*

01:37:49.764 --> 01:37:52.667
* You shelter me *

01:37:52.767 --> 01:37:55.203
* If rain's pouring down

01:37:55.303 --> 01:37:58.873
* And no matter where I go

01:37:58.974 --> 01:38:01.676
* Or what I do

01:38:01.776 --> 01:38:06.848
* I can always come home to You
*

01:38:11.453 --> 01:38:16.458
* I was desperate for a
place to hang my heart *

01:38:17.559 --> 01:38:22.564
* I was riding through
the desert in the dark *

01:38:23.365 --> 01:38:29.004
* I believed 'em when they
said there was no hope *

01:38:29.371 --> 01:38:34.376
* But You showed me love
unconditional *

01:38:35.477 --> 01:38:40.915
* But You called my name

01:38:41.249 --> 01:38:47.522
* And I knew I couldn't run from
grace *

01:38:48.190 --> 01:38:54.162
* You love me as deep as the
ocean *

01:38:54.562 --> 01:38:57.232
* And all You ask *

01:38:57.332 --> 01:39:00.902
* Is for me to keep holding

01:39:01.003 --> 01:39:03.505
* Onto Your right hand

01:39:03.605 --> 01:39:08.676
* You give me the strength to
stand *

01:39:10.178 --> 01:39:13.181
* Steady

01:39:13.281 --> 01:39:15.984
* Sure as the mountains

01:39:16.084 --> 01:39:19.154
* You shelter me

01:39:19.254 --> 01:39:21.856
* If rain's pouring down

01:39:21.956 --> 01:39:25.093
* And no matter where I go

01:39:25.193 --> 01:39:28.096
* Or what I do

01:39:28.196 --> 01:39:32.867
* I can always come home to You
*

01:39:38.106 --> 01:39:43.011
* You called my name

01:39:43.111 --> 01:39:48.116
* And I knew I was finally safe
*

01:39:49.984 --> 01:39:55.523
* You love me as deep as the
ocean *

01:39:56.024 --> 01:39:58.793
* And all You ask

01:39:58.893 --> 01:40:02.530
* Is for me to keep holding

01:40:02.630 --> 01:40:05.133
* Onto Your right hand

01:40:05.233 --> 01:40:10.238
* You give me the strength to
stand *

01:40:11.706 --> 01:40:14.609
* Steady

01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:17.545
* Sure as the mountains

01:40:17.645 --> 01:40:20.648
* You shelter me

01:40:20.748 --> 01:40:23.818
* If rain's pouring down

01:40:23.918 --> 01:40:26.788
* And no matter where I go

01:40:26.888 --> 01:40:29.557
* Or what I do

01:40:29.657 --> 01:40:33.661
* I can always come home to You
*
