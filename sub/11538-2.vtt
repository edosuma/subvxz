BUT YOU KNOW HE WAS GONE.

38:49.220 --> 38:51.550
SO, YOU COULD HAVE LET SOMEBODY
ELSE DEAL WITH THIS CASE.

38:51.550 --> 38:53.690
I TRIED TO FIX IT, OKAY?

38:53.690 --> 38:56.550
WELL, DID YOU?

38:56.550 --> 38:57.750
WELL, YEAH, I MEAN...

38:57.750 --> 38:59.920
WHAT IS IT, RICK?
SPEAK. WHAT?

38:59.920 --> 39:03.150
NO, I CAN'T TELL YOU.

39:03.150 --> 39:05.250
YOU KNOW SOMETHING
THAT CAN HELP HER?

39:07.350 --> 39:09.090
WELL, I PUT IN A FEW CALLS
TO A FEW PEOPLE,

39:09.090 --> 39:11.020
SO, YEAH,
THERE'S A CHANCE.

39:11.020 --> 39:13.350
DO YOU KNOW THAT SHE TRIED
TO KILL HERSELF?

39:13.350 --> 39:15.490
TODA--
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

39:15.490 --> 39:17.490
I KNOW.

39:17.490 --> 39:19.620
AND YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOW
TRYING TO KILL HER,

39:19.620 --> 39:21.490
YOU KNOW THIS, RIGHT?

39:21.490 --> 39:23.120
I KNOW, YEAH.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.750
SO, ARE YOU GONNA DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT,

39:24.750 --> 39:26.890
OR ARE YOU JUST GONNA
SIT THERE SAYING "I KNOW"?

39:26.890 --> 39:28.620
LOOK, ESPERANZA,
I'M TRYING --

39:28.620 --> 39:29.620
NO, NO,
YOU KNOW WHAT? STOP.

39:29.620 --> 39:31.290
NOW YOU'RE LAUGHING?
JUST GO TO HELL.

39:31.290 --> 39:32.520
YOU'RE A COWARD,
YOU'RE A LIAR,

39:32.520 --> 39:34.120
AND YOU'RE PAYING
FOR THESE DAMNED DRINKS.

39:35.520 --> 39:37.790
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, COME ON,
LET'S GET YOU TO A CAB.

39:37.790 --> 39:39.590
YOU CAN SHARE A CAB HOME
WITH ME, AT THE LEAST.

39:39.590 --> 39:40.850
RICK.
I'M STAYING.

39:40.850 --> 39:42.120
I DIDN'T COME HERE WITH YOU,
I'M STAYING.

39:42.120 --> 39:43.050
YOU SURE?
I'M GOOD.

39:43.050 --> 39:44.190
YOU SURE?
GOODBYE! BYE.

39:44.190 --> 39:45.720
OKAY.

39:45.720 --> 39:46.990

40:33.390 --> 40:36.250
HERE'S THE KEY.

40:36.250 --> 40:38.050
WHAT WE ALWAYS DO.

40:38.050 --> 40:41.120
LOVE IT WHEN YOU TALK
LIKE THAT. I'M IN.

40:41.120 --> 40:42.850
WHOOP HIS ASS REAL GOOD,

40:51.590 --> 40:55.090

I'M GONNA NEED AN ALIBI.

40:55.090 --> 40:56.220

40:58.150 --> 41:01.890
I'M GONNA GO FEED
THIS GUY HIS TEETH.

41:01.890 --> 41:02.750
I MAY BE SMALL,

41:02.750 --> 41:04.550

Eddie: HI, JOE.

41:12.250 --> 41:13.490
SHE WAS JUST SAYING
THAT SHE NEEDS TO GO HOME.

41:13.490 --> 41:14.750
CAN YOU GET YOUR HANDS
OFF OF ME?

41:14.750 --> 41:15.690
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

41:15.690 --> 41:17.190
WHATEVER THE HELL
I WANT TO WEAR.

41:17.190 --> 41:18.420
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
AND WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

41:18.420 --> 41:19.290
JUST CUT IT OUT.

41:19.290 --> 41:20.750

41:34.790 --> 41:36.350
YOU'RE A LOATHSOME BITCH,
YOU KNOW THAT?

41:36.350 --> 41:38.590
AND YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SPEAK
TO ME THAT WAY.

41:38.590 --> 41:40.590
EVERY TIME YOU START TALKING
ABOUT MY MONEY AND FINANCES,

41:40.590 --> 41:41.690
JUST SAY
WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY.

41:41.690 --> 41:44.750
IF YOU WANT TO GIVE HER
SOME MONEY FOR A LAWYER,

41:44.750 --> 41:47.290
I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU
WOULD TALK TO ME ABOUT IT.

41:47.290 --> 41:49.290
AND THEN HE STARTED
MESSING WITH MY SON.

41:49.290 --> 41:50.620
I COULD NOT
LET THAT HAPPEN.

41:50.620 --> 41:53.120
I THINK YOU PROBABLY
MAY HAVE SEEN ME
