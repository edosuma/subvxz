WEBVTT

00:02.440 --> 00:04.271
When are they expecting you in Brazil?

00:04.400 --> 00:06.470
I told them a couple of weeks
after the ceremony.

00:06.600 --> 00:09.353
With all the receptions,
and then I'll need at least a week...

00:09.480 --> 00:11.152
to clear up the linguistic database.

00:11.280 --> 00:13.157
After 10 years on this ship...

00:13.280 --> 00:15.874
I bet it'll take a while
getting used to the humidity again.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.592
And the bugs.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.551
Does the Captain have to
give a speech?

00:19.680 --> 00:23.150
-He's working on it now.
-He hates giving speeches.

00:23.280 --> 00:26.352
He'll undoubtedly make every effort
to take no credit.

00:26.480 --> 00:28.516
-Undoubtedly.
-That'd be like Zefram Cochrane...

00:28.640 --> 00:30.756
not taking credit for warp drive.

00:30.880 --> 00:34.077
How do you pronounce the name
of the second Tellarite liberator?

00:34.200 --> 00:35.235
Challash?

00:35.360 --> 00:36.793
Shallash.

00:36.920 --> 00:39.275
-Shallash, thanks.
-How's it going, sir?

00:39.400 --> 00:42.233
Whatever I write, it sounds like
I'm trying to take credit for this.

00:42.360 --> 00:46.319
Captain, Admiral Douglas is asking you
to approve the decommission protocols.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.510
One thing at a time.
After the charter's signed...

00:48.640 --> 00:51.632
I'll give him whatever he needs
to put Enterprise in mothballs.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.955
All senior staff, report to the Bridge.

00:54.080 --> 00:56.310
Computer, freeze programme.

00:57.360 --> 00:59.271
Save from this time index.

00:59.400 --> 01:00.753
Programme saved.

01:02.480 --> 01:03.549
End programme.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.200
It's been a long road

01:18.960 --> 01:20.837
Gettin' from there to here

01:22.240 --> 01:24.515
It's been a long time

01:25.840 --> 01:28.877
But my time is finally near

01:29.600 --> 01:33.115
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:33.720 --> 01:36.518
I will touch the sky

01:37.000 --> 01:40.549
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:40.680 --> 01:43.797
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:43.920 --> 01:47.833
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

01:48.440 --> 01:51.159
I'm going where my heart will take me

01:51.280 --> 01:54.989
I've got faith to believe

01:55.840 --> 01:58.559
I can do anything

01:58.680 --> 02:02.559
I've got strength of the soul

02:03.080 --> 02:05.878
And no one's gonna bend or break me

02:06.000 --> 02:09.356
I can reach any star

02:11.400 --> 02:13.118
I've got faith

02:15.120 --> 02:17.998
I've got faith

02:18.840 --> 02:22.515
Faith of the heart

02:32.840 --> 02:34.671
First Officer's Personal Log...

02:34.800 --> 02:37.553
Stardate 47457.1.

02:37.680 --> 02:40.911
With the unexpected arrival
of Admiral Pressman, my old CO...

02:41.040 --> 02:43.759
I find myself in an awkward position.

02:43.880 --> 02:46.599
Counsellor Troi has suggested
I might get a few insights...

02:46.720 --> 02:49.359
by calling up an historic holoprogram.

02:56.120 --> 02:58.554
Are you sure you don't want to talk
about what happened?

02:58.680 --> 03:00.557
I've told you everything I can.

03:00.840 --> 03:02.319
If it's a question
of breaking a promise....

03:02.440 --> 03:03.873
Not a promise.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.035
An order.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.628
Have you learnt anything
on the Holodeck about breaking orders?

03:07.760 --> 03:08.795
Not yet.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.309
I've gone back a couple of days earlier
to get a perspective.

03:11.440 --> 03:14.000
But I really don't see
how this is gonna help.

03:14.480 --> 03:17.517
That's why you run a starship,
and I'm a counsellor.

03:19.320 --> 03:20.878
Reed's shorter than I thought he'd be.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.116
-Maybe the programme's off.
-No, I'm sure it's fine.

03:23.240 --> 03:26.755
It's just, you expect larger-than-life
people to be larger than life.

03:26.880 --> 03:28.757
-Has the Andorian hailed them?
-Not yet.

03:28.880 --> 03:30.313
You might want to leap ahead
to that point.

03:30.440 --> 03:32.715
It's where things start really happening.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.512
And you should consider
taking over the Galley.

03:34.640 --> 03:35.675
Why?

03:35.800 --> 03:38.314
Well, Starfleet ships didn't have
counsellors in those days...

03:38.440 --> 03:41.273
but the chef on the first Enterprise
came pretty close.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.834
I read almost everybody confided in him.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.359
I'll keep that in mind.

03:45.480 --> 03:46.629
-Supper?
-You bet.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.637
-I'll give you an update.
-Okay.

03:52.760 --> 03:54.113
That's impossible.

03:55.040 --> 03:57.508
Shran's been dead for what,
three years?

04:02.360 --> 04:04.157
This is quite a surprise.

04:04.280 --> 04:05.759
I'm sorry, pinkskin.

04:05.880 --> 04:09.350
But it was essential certain people
believed I had met my demise.

04:09.480 --> 04:10.515
Including me.

04:10.640 --> 04:14.315
I know it's been awhile, but as I recall,
you still owe me a favour.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.353
I remember.

04:17.240 --> 04:19.356
But this isn't a good time, Shran.

04:19.480 --> 04:20.879
I assume you know
where we're heading.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.956
I may no longer be a member
of the Imperial Guard...

04:23.080 --> 04:25.355
but I'm aware of the proposed coalition.

04:25.480 --> 04:26.959
It's more than a proposal.

04:27.080 --> 04:28.991
We're on our way to Earth
to sign the charter.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.838
The ceremony isn't for three days.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.793
If my plan works,
you'll be home in plenty of time.

04:35.440 --> 04:38.318
I'm afraid a detour
is out of the question right now.

04:38.440 --> 04:41.079
My child's been abducted!

04:41.200 --> 04:42.315
Kidnapped.

04:42.440 --> 04:44.749
You owe me.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.357
You never told me you had a child.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.436
Jhamel gave birth five years ago.

04:49.560 --> 04:52.313
A daughter. They've taken her.

04:52.440 --> 04:53.475
Who?

04:53.600 --> 04:58.037
Former associates. It's a long story.
You need to let me come aboard.

05:03.360 --> 05:04.509
Set a rendezvous course.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.710
Computer, freeze programme.

05:07.680 --> 05:11.593
Advance ahead one hour.
Switch to objective mode.

05:19.080 --> 05:22.117
Who would have thought civilian life
would be more dangerous...

05:22.240 --> 05:24.231
than commanding a ship
for the lmperial Guard.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.794
I still don't understand why you left.

05:26.920 --> 05:29.832
-You were a hero.
-A hero with a family.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.629
I always believed
that change was a good thing.

05:34.760 --> 05:35.988
I was a fool.

05:36.120 --> 05:39.749
-Why would you fake your own death?
-I made some poor choices.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.476
Picked the wrong friends...

05:42.600 --> 05:45.717
people involved
in questionable business ventures.

05:45.840 --> 05:48.877
They think I took something
that belonged to them.

05:49.320 --> 05:52.198
With the help of some old colleagues
from the Guard...

05:52.320 --> 05:54.709
I managed to make myself disappear.

05:54.840 --> 05:56.512
It worked...

05:56.640 --> 05:58.790
for nearly three years.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.558
Your friends found you?

06:00.680 --> 06:04.195
Six months ago.
I've been on the move ever since.

06:04.640 --> 06:07.393
They took her in the middle of the night.

06:07.520 --> 06:10.796
I was in the next room, asleep!

06:11.320 --> 06:12.912
Useless!

06:14.360 --> 06:16.237
It's been a week.

06:16.360 --> 06:20.239
They say if I don't return what's theirs,
they'll kill her.

06:20.840 --> 06:23.593
-Then give them what they want.
-I don't have it!

06:24.120 --> 06:27.112
-I never did.
-But you have a plan.

06:28.040 --> 06:31.589
It cost me everything I had,
but I managed to find out...

06:31.720 --> 06:33.517
where they've taken her.

06:33.640 --> 06:36.279
They're on a trading outpost, Rigel X.

06:36.400 --> 06:39.278
-I'm familiar with it.
-I know these men quite well, Captain.

06:39.400 --> 06:43.598
I can outwit them, I've done it before.
But I'll need at least seven men.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.473
You have to help me.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.478
It's my little girl.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.470
He's an admitted criminal,
you said so yourself.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.716
He said he fell in
with some disreputable people.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.319
That doesn't make him a criminal.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.238
If we're late for the ceremony,
it'll have far-reaching consequences.

06:58.360 --> 06:59.475
If Shran hadn't helped us...

06:59.600 --> 07:01.352
I never would have gotten aboard
the Xindi weapon.

07:01.480 --> 07:02.833
Have you forgotten that?

07:02.960 --> 07:04.552
This alliance is based on friendship...

07:04.680 --> 07:07.274
and loyalty, exactly what Shran
is looking for right now.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.197
-I don't trust him.
-You don't trust Andorians...

07:09.320 --> 07:10.355
you never have.

07:10.480 --> 07:13.438
Thank God the Vulcan Council
is a little more enlightened than you are.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.676
If they're willing to forge an alliance
with Andoria...

07:15.800 --> 07:18.758
the least you can do
is give Shran the benefit of the doubt.

07:18.880 --> 07:22.316
When we met 10 years ago,
I didn't trust you.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.274
For that matter,
I didn't trust any Vulcans.

07:25.400 --> 07:28.198
You helped me
get past that, remember?

07:28.320 --> 07:31.357
I listened to you.
Now it's your turn to listen to me.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.755
I can't turn my back on him, T'Pol.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.793
-Try to understand.
-I'll try.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.279
By the way...

07:42.000 --> 07:44.275
drop by the Galley
when you get a moment.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.870
Chef's trying to come up with a menu
for our last dinner together.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.116
He wants to know
everybody's favourite dish.

07:50.240 --> 07:52.515
There are 83 crew members aboard.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.437
Just go see him, all right?

07:58.840 --> 08:00.478
Don't worry.

08:00.600 --> 08:03.239
Chef's promised
at least six kinds of cheese.

08:04.880 --> 08:06.154
I appreciate the gesture...

08:06.280 --> 08:09.477
but it's not necessary
to prepare a special dish for me.

08:09.600 --> 08:10.749
Come on.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.673
I've already started to reduce
the plomeek broth.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.189
All I need to know is
which roots you prefer.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.914
In that case, I prefer to be surprised.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.793
Pull up a chair.
I could use the company.

08:23.040 --> 08:27.033
I heard a rumour I may be whipping up
some Andorian cabbage soup tonight.

08:27.160 --> 08:30.232
We have already lost five hours
picking up Shran's shuttle.

08:30.360 --> 08:31.952
Now we're going to lose
at least another day...

08:32.080 --> 08:33.991
diverting our course to Rigel.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.076
His child's in danger.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.273
Is there anything aboard this ship
you don't know?

08:39.400 --> 08:42.312
Jonathan is a compassionate man.
You should know that by now.

08:42.440 --> 08:45.955
His compassion has gotten us
into trouble on many occasions.

08:46.520 --> 08:48.476
We could miss this ceremony.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.909
Don't worry.
I've got a hunch you're going to make it.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.315
-Tea?
-Thank you.

08:54.160 --> 08:57.470
Phlox has given me
his largest Edosian suckerfish.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.353
Excuse me?

08:59.760 --> 09:02.911
Looks like a catfish.
I'm hoping it tastes like one.

09:03.040 --> 09:05.554
Commander Tucker's crazy for catfish.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.598
Do you ever miss him?

09:07.720 --> 09:10.473
I spent the morning with him,
recalibrating the plasma array.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.192
That's not what I mean.

09:12.360 --> 09:15.272
If you're referring
to our intimate relationship...

09:15.400 --> 09:17.072
that's been over for six years.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.475
But the question remains,
do you miss him?

09:19.600 --> 09:22.797
I'm Vulcan. I don't miss people.

09:22.920 --> 09:24.319
Sorry, I forgot.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.954
Is he as concerned as you
about making this ceremony?

09:27.080 --> 09:29.310
Trip rarely questions
the Captain's decisions.

09:29.440 --> 09:33.069
He doesn't strike me
as someone who follows orders blindly.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.351
He's not. He simply tends to agree
with the Captain most of the time.

09:36.480 --> 09:37.959
He trusts him.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.477
Would you peel these for me?

09:45.320 --> 09:46.719
Before I joined this crew...

09:46.840 --> 09:50.037
I never could have imagined anything
more important than following orders.

09:50.160 --> 09:51.149
And now?

09:52.480 --> 09:56.553
Humans believe that sometimes
you have to follow your instincts.

09:56.680 --> 10:00.992
Very illogical approach,
but one I've come to embrace.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.158
Computer, freeze programme.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.834
Thanks.

10:31.160 --> 10:32.593
There you are.

10:33.880 --> 10:36.633
-Someone you know?
-Someone I knew.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.635
-Pegasus?
-Phil Wallace.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.716
Hell of a handball player.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.796
Pressman was getting ready
to promote him.

10:43.920 --> 10:45.433
How many died?

10:46.120 --> 10:47.348
Seventy-one.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.959
All but nine of us.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.992
How do you feel about learning
the ship wasn't destroyed?

10:52.120 --> 10:55.078
What difference does it make?
Seventy-one people died.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.992
You're feeling guilty.

10:58.960 --> 11:01.599
You think in some way
you were responsible?

11:01.720 --> 11:04.029
You're the empath.
Why don't you tell me?

11:05.360 --> 11:07.191
I think it's something else.

11:07.320 --> 11:09.470
Something about seeing that ship again.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.192
Why don't we change
the subject? Okay?

11:11.320 --> 11:12.469
Okay.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.758
How did things go on the Holodeck?

11:15.880 --> 11:18.599
They picked up the Andorian.
They're on their way to Rigel X.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.553
I was referring to any insight
you may have gained.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.875
I took your advice about the chef.
You were right.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.069
T'Pol opened up to me.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.792
Have you met with Commander Tucker?

11:26.920 --> 11:28.797
No, I haven't made it to Engineering yet.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.717
Have you spent any time on the NX-01?

11:30.840 --> 11:33.229
-I've never run the programme.
-What about the ship itself?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.715
I think I went
when I was a little girl, but...

11:35.840 --> 11:37.796
I get all those museum ships mixed up.

11:37.920 --> 11:40.309
Now's your chance.
Come on down with me.

11:40.440 --> 11:42.078
I have an appointment in an hour.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.714
I'll get you back in plenty of time.
Come on.

11:45.440 --> 11:48.477
-Our Brig is bigger than this.
-A lot of things change in 200 years.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.272
Watch yourself!

11:50.400 --> 11:51.389
No fish tank.

11:51.520 --> 11:54.353
How could Archer survive
without a fish tank?

11:56.480 --> 11:57.674
Allow me.

12:02.240 --> 12:03.593
He does have a dog, though.

12:03.720 --> 12:06.154
Right, I remember.
One of the Musketeers.

12:06.280 --> 12:07.269
Porthos.

12:08.040 --> 12:09.393
Comfy.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.511
No seat for the First Officer?

12:11.640 --> 12:14.598
Perhaps Archer wasn't as fussy
as Captain Picard...

12:14.720 --> 12:17.553
when it came to people
sitting in his chair.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.670
I remember seeing one of these
in a photograph.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.677
Kirk's ship had them, I think.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.314
Engineering's down this way.

12:26.440 --> 12:29.352
There's something lonely about a ship
without its crew.

12:29.480 --> 12:32.995
Computer, add an appropriate
crew complement, objective mode.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.479
That's better.

12:36.320 --> 12:40.393
If you recall, Rigel X is filled
with a very unsavoury element.

12:40.520 --> 12:43.830
And I rather doubt Shran's scheme
will be quite as simple as he claims.

12:43.960 --> 12:46.030
I can't imagine the Captain
would put us in jeopardy...

12:46.160 --> 12:47.798
this close to signing the charter.

12:47.920 --> 12:49.273
I don't like it.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.230
What exactly are you doing?

12:52.360 --> 12:55.193
These injectors need to be purged
every six months.

12:56.120 --> 12:58.111
Are the deuterium filters clear?

12:58.240 --> 12:59.992
-We've done all but three.
-All right.

13:00.120 --> 13:02.395
-Make it quick.
-Aye, sir.

13:02.520 --> 13:06.399
Well, what's the point? This ship will be
joining the mothball fleet next week.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.476
I pretty much built this engine.

13:08.600 --> 13:11.637
Plan to take care of it as long as I can.

13:16.520 --> 13:18.431
Been a hell of a run, Malcolm.

13:20.440 --> 13:22.749
I never thought it would come to an end.

13:25.840 --> 13:27.353
All good things.

13:30.040 --> 13:33.077
Captain thinks there'll be another
Enterprise before too long.

13:33.200 --> 13:34.553
I imagine.

13:35.240 --> 13:36.673
It won't be the same.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.314
That's okay.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.115
Come on.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.439
It's sad.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.991
Commander Tucker had no idea
he wouldn't make it back.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.757
How reliable are your sources?

13:59.880 --> 14:02.314
They're criminals, but honourable ones.

14:02.440 --> 14:06.115
They promise me that Talla's being
held here, at Upper Level 4.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.118
Have you fashioned the amethyst?

14:08.240 --> 14:10.879
The photograph you gave us
had poor resolution...

14:11.000 --> 14:13.468
but I'm confident
our replication will look authentic.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.319
The Tenebian amethyst
they think I stole was flawless.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.795
They'll undoubtedly have
magnifying equipment with them.

14:18.920 --> 14:22.435
They'll need a spectral micrometer
to see it's a fabrication.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.471
How many do you expect to show up?

14:24.600 --> 14:26.716
Computer, freeze programme.

14:29.280 --> 14:31.748
-He's cute.
-Don't get any ideas.

14:31.880 --> 14:34.519
Reg will be furious if I'm late.
Are you going to stay?

14:34.640 --> 14:36.119
-Yeah, for a little while.
-Good luck.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.639
Computer, arch.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.476
Computer,
how long before they reach Rigel X?

14:44.600 --> 14:46.556
16 hours, 22 minutes.

14:46.680 --> 14:49.399
Advance to that point.
Stay in objective mode.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.114
-Move into a stationary orbit.
-Aye, sir.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.276
Put a team together.
Meet us in the Launch Bay.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.755
Captain, can I have a word with you?

15:00.800 --> 15:02.518
We can handle this without you.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.995
-Well, that's flattering.
-You know what I mean.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.429
You've got the biggest day of your life
coming up.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.437
A lot of people are counting
on you being there.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.630
I appreciate you worrying about me,
but I'll be fine.

15:11.760 --> 15:14.069
You don't need to be putting yourself
in harm's way.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.156
I'm telling you, we can take care of it.

15:16.280 --> 15:18.236
Rigel was the first place we visited,
remember?

15:18.360 --> 15:20.157
Now it's going to be the last.

15:20.280 --> 15:23.397
Poetic justice.
Why should you have all the fun?

15:29.280 --> 15:32.636
We're going through the troposphere.
Might get a little bumpy.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.876
Have you been down to see Chef yet?

15:35.600 --> 15:37.716
First thing this morning. You?

15:38.920 --> 15:40.478
He talked about you.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.110
-Me?
-Us.

15:43.480 --> 15:44.799
What about us?

15:46.560 --> 15:48.118
It's not important.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.952
Why'd you bring it up then?

15:56.400 --> 15:58.118
Do you ever miss me?

16:00.520 --> 16:02.192
-You mean....
-Yes.

16:03.040 --> 16:06.271
-You know how long it's been?
-That's not what I asked you.

16:08.440 --> 16:09.429
Well.

16:11.440 --> 16:13.112
Yeah, I guess, sometimes.

16:16.840 --> 16:19.195
I haven't thought about those days
in a long time.

16:19.320 --> 16:21.117
Benefit of being a Vulcan.

16:22.840 --> 16:26.116
After speaking with Chef, I realised
we may never see each other again.

16:26.240 --> 16:27.798
What are you talking about?

16:27.920 --> 16:30.593
We're taking different assignments.
There's no way of knowing--

16:30.720 --> 16:32.836
There's every way of knowing.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.593
I can guarantee you
we're not going to lose touch.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.955
Stop thinking like that.

16:44.240 --> 16:46.071
However long it may be...

16:47.000 --> 16:48.911
I believe I'm going to miss you.

16:51.280 --> 16:53.794
-Archer to Shuttlepod Two.
-Go ahead, sir.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.309
Shran has made contact.
Everything's set.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.317
-I'll lead you in.
-Understood.

17:16.040 --> 17:17.268
Stop there.

17:20.040 --> 17:24.636
Unless I'm mistaken, I thought you had
no idea where the amethyst was.

17:24.760 --> 17:26.034
Where's my daughter?

17:26.160 --> 17:29.277
Funny how a missing child is a way
to jog the memory, Shran?

17:29.400 --> 17:30.879
Where is she?

17:31.040 --> 17:34.396
I thought you were happily married.
Who's the Vulcan?

17:34.520 --> 17:37.830
I'm not interested in your associates,
so don't question mine.

17:37.960 --> 17:41.396
-Put the case down and open it.
-We want the child first.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.033
I could shoot you both.

17:43.160 --> 17:46.197
You'll never get this case open,
I promise you.

17:46.720 --> 17:49.314
You let a female negotiate
for you, Shran?

17:49.440 --> 17:50.714
You heard her.

18:00.720 --> 18:03.917
-Are you all right?
-I'm hungry.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.837
Now open the case.

18:24.360 --> 18:25.759
Set it down.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.074
Now back up.

18:37.640 --> 18:39.437
Let her take the girl.

18:39.560 --> 18:41.835
Fine, but you stay.

18:41.960 --> 18:46.078
One step, and this little blue beauty
won't have a father to come home to.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.835
I want you to go with T'Pol.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.792
You'll be safe with her.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.350
She'll find you something to eat.

19:03.400 --> 19:04.800
Obey your father.

19:04.800 --> 19:05.073
Obey your father.

19:16.760 --> 19:18.159
Now step back.

19:41.360 --> 19:42.839
What are you doing?

19:57.480 --> 19:59.835
Stand still and you won't be harmed!

20:45.320 --> 20:46.548
Hold on!

20:52.960 --> 20:54.791
Thanks, boss.

20:56.480 --> 20:57.913
Any time.

21:07.240 --> 21:09.993
You're certain
that it won't be a problem?

21:10.640 --> 21:14.428
I'll feel more comfortable getting you
away from your friends at warp 4.

21:14.560 --> 21:18.030
My shuttle may be slow,
but their ships can barely make warp 2.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.913
All the same, you'll be under
your own power by tomorrow night.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.918
We'll contact your wife and tell her
to expect you the next morning.

21:24.040 --> 21:26.508
I told you
my plan would only take a few hours.

21:26.640 --> 21:27.834
You're welcome.

21:28.760 --> 21:32.070
You should let Phlox take a look at her
before you go to your quarters.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.872
Whatever you say, Captain.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.752
Thanks, pinkskin.

21:39.440 --> 21:41.954
You must be getting tired
of saving my life.

21:42.080 --> 21:44.389
I'm glad I didn't take your advice
about not coming along.

21:44.520 --> 21:45.714
Yeah, you and me both.

21:45.840 --> 21:48.149
Then again, you almost
got yourself killed down there.

21:48.280 --> 21:50.430
Wouldn't have gone over too big
at the ceremony.

21:50.560 --> 21:53.870
Signing documents are easy.
Training a new engineer...

21:54.000 --> 21:56.070
that can be a real pain in the ass.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.794
-Data to Counsellor Troi.
-Yes, Data?

22:10.920 --> 22:13.309
I was wondering
if this might be an appropriate time...

22:13.440 --> 22:16.273
to continue our discussion on
the long-term effects of space travel...

22:16.400 --> 22:18.038
on my positronic net.

22:18.160 --> 22:20.720
-Can I give you a rain check?
-You may...

22:20.840 --> 22:22.717
check me for rain
if you wish, Counsellor...

22:22.840 --> 22:24.353
but I assure you,
I have no water in my--

22:24.480 --> 22:27.119
Data, I'll get back to you.
Come in.

22:28.760 --> 22:31.593
-I know it's past office hours.
-What is it?

22:33.840 --> 22:35.910
It won't be long
before they find the Pegasus.

22:36.040 --> 22:37.951
You haven't made your decision.

22:39.680 --> 22:42.194
-The Holodeck?
-They rescued the Andorian's daughter.

22:42.320 --> 22:45.278
So you're coming to the moment of
truth in there, as well.

22:45.400 --> 22:48.278
I need you to promise
you'll keep this confidential.

22:48.600 --> 22:49.715
You know I will.

22:49.840 --> 22:51.671
What do you know
about the Treaty of Algeron?

22:51.800 --> 22:55.429
2311, it redefined
the Romulan Neutral Zone.

22:55.560 --> 22:59.553
It also outlawed the use of cloaking
technology on Starfleet vessels.

22:59.680 --> 23:01.432
The Pegasus?

23:01.560 --> 23:04.711
A secret group in Starfleet Security
developed a prototype.

23:04.840 --> 23:07.195
Pressman was put
in charge of testing it.

23:07.320 --> 23:09.993
That's why they're so eager to find it
before the Romulans do.

23:10.120 --> 23:12.395
The accident, the 71 people who died...

23:13.320 --> 23:15.390
we were testing the cloaking device.

23:15.800 --> 23:16.915
It was covered up.

23:17.040 --> 23:20.191
The nine of us who made it back alive
were sworn to secrecy.

23:20.320 --> 23:21.992
And you've lived with that for 12 years?

23:22.120 --> 23:24.918
They want to pick the experiment up
where they left off.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.109
Are you sure?

23:26.240 --> 23:27.992
Pressman told me himself.

23:29.160 --> 23:31.276
What they're doing is wrong.

23:31.720 --> 23:33.597
It could jeopardise the treaty.

23:35.240 --> 23:37.629
And you want to tell that
to Captain Picard.

23:37.760 --> 23:41.275
I took an oath of secrecy.
Pressman still outranks the Captain.

23:42.520 --> 23:43.635
Will.

23:45.160 --> 23:48.948
You didn't get this far in your career
making easy decisions.

23:50.040 --> 23:52.713
I'm confident
you'll make the right one now.

23:54.080 --> 23:55.354
I wish I was.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.710
He was anything but tactful.

23:59.160 --> 24:01.151
What his countrymen
might refer to as a hick.

24:01.280 --> 24:04.477
For the life of me, I couldn't understand
what Captain Archer saw in him.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.670
Thinner. Roll it
a little bit thinner, like this.

24:06.800 --> 24:09.189
-Yeah, right.
-Go on.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.354
That's about it, really.

24:11.480 --> 24:14.153
I used to think
that first impressions meant something.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.191
I guess it's not always true.

24:16.320 --> 24:19.756
You know, to be honest, I didn't think
he was going to last a month.

24:19.880 --> 24:22.394
Old friend of the Captain's or not.

24:22.520 --> 24:23.555
And now...

24:23.680 --> 24:26.956
I can't imagine what these last 10 years
would have been like without him.

24:27.080 --> 24:29.548
Did you ever find yourself
attracted to him?

24:30.120 --> 24:33.635
Maybe a little.
I never really thought he was my type.

24:33.760 --> 24:35.398
Didn't even graduate college...

24:35.520 --> 24:38.956
he learnt about engineering working
on boat engines, I think...

24:40.080 --> 24:42.275
never cared much about languages...

24:42.920 --> 24:45.275
could barely speak English.

24:46.440 --> 24:48.351
But he did have his moments.

24:49.920 --> 24:52.115
I still find him kind of cute.

24:53.120 --> 24:55.634
-Keep that to yourself.
-Always do.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.716
Captain said they've known each other
a long time.

24:57.840 --> 24:59.034
Close to 20 years.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.912
He taught the Captain
how to scuba dive...

25:01.040 --> 25:02.519
somewhere off the coast of Florida.

25:02.640 --> 25:05.154
You're pressing too hard.
Just slow, steady movement.

25:05.280 --> 25:06.998
-Sorry.
-No need to apologise.

25:07.120 --> 25:09.076
They've got a shorthand
they use sometimes.

25:09.200 --> 25:11.191
Comes from spending
so much time together.

25:11.320 --> 25:14.596
-Did Trip ever take a swing at Picard?
-At who?

25:15.440 --> 25:16.998
Archer, Captain Archer?

25:17.120 --> 25:18.519
Not that I know of.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.153
When push comes to shove...

25:20.280 --> 25:23.113
Commander Tucker usually
ends up doing the right thing.

25:23.240 --> 25:24.958
-How am I doing?
-Don't let it get too big.

25:25.080 --> 25:27.355
Now fold it over. There you go.

25:28.840 --> 25:32.150
And he's always pushing himself,
often to the point of exhaustion.

25:32.280 --> 25:35.272
He's forced me to order him to relax
on more than one occasion.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.719
-To relax?
-Yeah.

25:36.840 --> 25:40.276
Wasn't very keen on getting
neuropressure treatments from T'Pol.

25:40.520 --> 25:42.988
But it was that
or become addicted to sedatives.

25:43.120 --> 25:46.715
-lf I remember correctly, that's when....
-Their romance began?

25:46.840 --> 25:47.909
Precisely.

25:48.040 --> 25:51.794
One time, he became so exhausted,
I had to demand he get six hours sleep.

25:51.920 --> 25:54.354
He negotiated it down to four.

25:54.480 --> 25:56.994
A very stubborn young man.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.038
I quite enjoy this.

26:00.160 --> 26:03.072
-So did he follow your orders?
-Didn't have a choice.

26:04.720 --> 26:06.438
You've always got a choice.

26:07.840 --> 26:09.751
So do you think
this alliance is going to hold?

26:09.880 --> 26:12.713
We better hope so, there are
thousands of planets within reach.

26:12.840 --> 26:14.319
Got to start somewhere.

26:14.440 --> 26:16.032
Who would have guessed?

26:16.160 --> 26:18.674
Vulcans and Andorians
in the same bed.

26:19.560 --> 26:22.836
The Tellarites were never big fans
of the Andorians, either.

26:23.640 --> 26:25.517
This is a special bottle of whiskey.

26:25.640 --> 26:28.712
Zefram Cochrane gave it to my father
the day they broke ground...

26:28.840 --> 26:30.273
at the Warp 5 Complex.

26:30.400 --> 26:31.958
And here we are...

26:32.400 --> 26:34.118
toasting to warp 7.

26:35.440 --> 26:37.317
Here's to the next generation.

26:42.080 --> 26:43.354
Written your speech yet?

26:43.480 --> 26:46.358
I always crammed before exams.
I've got three days left.

26:46.480 --> 26:50.029
The biggest day of your life, and
you're gonna wait until the night before.

26:50.160 --> 26:53.436
-It's the biggest day of our lives.
-I hate to contradict you, Captain.

26:53.560 --> 26:55.790
You're the man they're waiting to see.

27:00.360 --> 27:02.430
Archer to the Bridge. What's going on?

27:02.560 --> 27:04.869
We're under attack, sir. A small vessel.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.036
-Who are they?
-We don't know yet.

27:09.040 --> 27:10.473
Intruder alert.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.632
We've come for Shran and the child.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.910
I thought you said
their ship couldn't catch up to us.

27:18.040 --> 27:20.110
Remind me to mention that to Shran.

27:20.960 --> 27:24.396
-You're leaving me very little choice.
-Shran left six hours ago.

27:24.520 --> 27:26.397
-You're too late.
-You're lying.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.715
His shuttle is still in your Launch Bay.

27:28.840 --> 27:30.159
-Kill him.
-Hold on! Wait a minute!

27:30.280 --> 27:31.872
-I'll take care of this.
-The hell you will.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.479
I'll bring you to Shran.
I know where he is.

27:33.600 --> 27:35.272
-I gave you an order, Commander.
-You heard me.

27:35.400 --> 27:36.515
-I said I'd bring you to Shran.
-Trip!

27:36.640 --> 27:37.629
Turn around, both of you!

27:37.760 --> 27:39.239
-Hey, this guy's the Captain.
-That's enough.

27:39.360 --> 27:40.839
He's my boss.
If I'm gonna disobey his order.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.109
I don't want him coming along.

27:42.240 --> 27:44.754
-Trip, that's enough!
-Listen, I won't do this if you kill him...

27:44.880 --> 27:46.916
but could you please shut him up!

27:50.440 --> 27:51.555
Stop.

27:51.680 --> 27:53.671
You can't expect me
to just leave him here alive.

27:53.800 --> 27:56.519
He's out cold.
He's not going to cause any trouble.

27:56.640 --> 27:59.552
Stay here.
If we're not back in 10 minutes, kill him.

27:59.680 --> 28:02.638
Didn't you hear what I just said?
I won't help you if you kill him.

28:02.760 --> 28:04.159
This might take longer than 10 minutes!

28:04.280 --> 28:06.271
Take me to Shran,
or I'll kill him right now!

28:06.400 --> 28:07.549
Okay!

28:08.840 --> 28:10.512
I've got a better idea.

28:11.120 --> 28:14.157
I'll bring Shran to us.
We don't have to go anywhere.

28:16.240 --> 28:17.468
Be very careful.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.436
You can all come see for yourselves.

28:22.280 --> 28:24.032
This is just a comm station.

28:28.360 --> 28:29.952
I'm gonna need to open this
so I can bypass...

28:30.080 --> 28:32.071
the security protocols. Is that okay?

28:32.200 --> 28:34.350
As long as you keep your hands
where we can see them.

28:34.480 --> 28:35.515
No problem.

28:47.840 --> 28:51.515
All I need to do is connect this
to the relay inside that panel.

28:51.640 --> 28:52.709
Stop.

28:52.840 --> 28:54.273
Open it for him.

28:55.440 --> 28:59.194
If there's a weapon in there,
you're going to die before your captain.

29:03.360 --> 29:04.759
Satisfied?

29:06.320 --> 29:07.639
Proceed.

29:13.240 --> 29:15.800
Hurry up. You're running out of time.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.718
There's just one other thing
I need to tell you.

29:19.400 --> 29:21.356
You can all go straight to hell.

29:45.440 --> 29:46.429
Trip?

30:02.680 --> 30:04.989
-He's not responding.
-Add two percent syntho-surfactant!

30:05.120 --> 30:06.792
-Doctor.
-The plasma was super-heated.

30:06.920 --> 30:10.037
It thermalised his lungs.
Initialise a hyperbaric chamber.

30:11.560 --> 30:16.190
Sorry about the rifle butt.

30:17.960 --> 30:21.157
-I was just trying to....
-I know, Trip.

30:21.280 --> 30:23.111
Just take it easy. Everything's all right.

30:23.240 --> 30:25.470
-We gonna be late?
-No.

30:25.600 --> 30:29.479
We're gonna be right on schedule.
I'll even have time to write my speech.

30:30.040 --> 30:31.553
Great news.

30:32.440 --> 30:34.112
Wait till they....

30:36.040 --> 30:38.349
We need to get him
into the chamber now!

30:45.720 --> 30:46.755
Clear!

31:34.720 --> 31:36.153
Need any help?

31:38.360 --> 31:39.759
No, thank you.

31:40.720 --> 31:42.233
For his parents?

31:44.080 --> 31:45.877
Will they still be coming
to the ceremony?

31:46.000 --> 31:49.151
I told them I thought Trip
wouldn't want it any other way.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.398
Don't forget this.

32:02.960 --> 32:05.838
-I'd like to meet them.
-His parents?

32:06.600 --> 32:08.272
Yes, I'd like to meet them.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.672
They're a little eccentric.

32:12.040 --> 32:15.237
I think you'll see
where Trip got his sense of humour.

32:16.520 --> 32:19.273
My mother was
somewhat eccentric, as well.

32:19.400 --> 32:20.435
I remember.

32:24.840 --> 32:28.628
Trip told me as the years went by
that I would miss her less.

32:29.400 --> 32:30.913
But he was wrong...

32:31.360 --> 32:34.272
because I find myself missing her more.

32:36.600 --> 32:38.511
Why would he tell me that?

32:40.840 --> 32:43.638
Time heals all wounds.

32:43.760 --> 32:47.116
But absence makes
the heart grow fonder.

32:47.240 --> 32:49.310
I guess it's a little tricky.

32:52.040 --> 32:55.589
Emotions have a way
of contradicting themselves.

32:57.160 --> 32:59.355
And you wonder
why we suppress them?

33:02.840 --> 33:07.277
When I took command 10 years ago,
I saw myself as an explorer.

33:08.400 --> 33:11.517
I thought all the risks would be worth it.

33:11.640 --> 33:14.996
Because just beyond the next planet,
just beyond the next star...

33:15.120 --> 33:19.511
there would be something magnificent,
something noble.

33:25.440 --> 33:29.831
And now, Trip is dead,
and I have to give a speech about...

33:30.480 --> 33:32.869
how worthwhile it's all been.

33:34.600 --> 33:38.036
Trip would be the first to say
it was worthwhile.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.668
Fried catfish with hush puppies.

33:53.800 --> 33:57.031
Obviously, the Captain mentioned
why I wanted to see you.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.628
Keep in mind, within a week,
I'll be eating the real thing.

33:59.760 --> 34:02.399
-Taking my folks down to Mobile.
-Nothing like a challenge.

34:02.520 --> 34:05.478
-Captain asked for meatloaf, didn't he?
-I haven't spoken to him yet.

34:05.600 --> 34:08.433
How about T'Pol?
She won't be very cooperative.

34:08.560 --> 34:10.039
You wait and see.

34:10.159 --> 34:11.956
I've already started her plomeek broth.

34:12.080 --> 34:14.674
All she has to do
is choose a few final ingredients.

34:14.800 --> 34:16.995
She'll be down here in about an hour.

34:17.440 --> 34:19.431
I hear we're on our way
to pick up Shran.

34:19.560 --> 34:21.152
Can you believe it?

34:21.280 --> 34:22.679
We all thought he was dead and gone.

34:22.800 --> 34:25.234
Don't you think
the Captain's cutting it a little close?

34:25.360 --> 34:28.033
You mean, getting back
to San Francisco?

34:28.159 --> 34:31.755
He won't let anything
get in the way of that. Trust me.

34:33.040 --> 34:35.634
-Can you spare one of those carrots?
-They're not peeled yet.

34:35.760 --> 34:36.875
That's okay.

34:40.239 --> 34:43.277
You know, he'd never admit it...

34:44.000 --> 34:46.434
but this thing means
a hell of a lot to him.

34:46.840 --> 34:49.513
He's real proud to be one of the people
signing this charter.

34:49.639 --> 34:51.755
And he ought to be.

34:51.880 --> 34:55.429
You sound like a lifetime member
of the Jonathan Archer Fan Club.

34:57.040 --> 35:00.237
I can count on one hand
the number of people I trust.

35:01.760 --> 35:03.432
I don't mean trust like...

35:04.120 --> 35:08.079
"l trust you aren't lying to me," or
"l trust you won't steal my money."

35:08.440 --> 35:11.000
I'm talking about
the kind of trust where...

35:11.440 --> 35:14.671
you know someone's
not gonna hurt you, no matter what.

35:14.800 --> 35:18.952
Where you know they'll always be there
for you, no matter how bad things get.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.950
You ever know anybody like that?

35:23.360 --> 35:24.349
Yeah.

35:25.440 --> 35:26.714
One or two.

35:29.360 --> 35:32.750
Well, I've got some packing to do
before I go back on duty.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.675
You figured out what you're gonna do?

35:36.800 --> 35:37.789
Do?

35:37.920 --> 35:39.797
You gonna sign onto another ship
or are you gonna...

35:39.920 --> 35:42.514
open up that little restaurant
in the Berkshires you told me about?

35:42.640 --> 35:45.473
You know, I haven't decided yet.
You got any advice?

35:46.400 --> 35:47.469
Nope.

35:51.360 --> 35:53.749
But I'm sure
you'll make the right choice.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.039
Are you certain
these are the right seats?

36:05.160 --> 36:06.354
Yep.

36:07.360 --> 36:09.749
They don't seem very VlP to me.

36:09.880 --> 36:12.110
I'm sure the Admiral wanted us
to have a view...

36:12.240 --> 36:14.435
that took in the scope of the occasion.

36:14.560 --> 36:17.950
From this distance you can't tell
an Andorian from a Tellarite.

36:18.880 --> 36:21.030
Have you given an answer
to Captain Stillwell yet?

36:21.160 --> 36:22.593
I've asked him for a little more time...

36:22.720 --> 36:25.154
until Captain Archer decides
what he's going to be doing.

36:25.280 --> 36:28.317
I'll bet you a month's pay
he'll be on the bridge of a new ship.

36:28.440 --> 36:31.398
He won't be able to resist
one of those warp 7 beauties.

36:31.520 --> 36:33.875
I've heard he's already been tapped
for admiral.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.958
Malcolm's right.
They'll never keep him behind a desk.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.635
It's very wise of you to stick with him.

36:39.880 --> 36:42.189
That's exactly what I plan to do.

36:50.440 --> 36:52.271
Please, stand still.

36:52.400 --> 36:55.517
If you hadn't waited until the last minute,
you would have had time...

36:55.640 --> 36:57.551
to memorise your speech.

36:57.680 --> 36:59.398
You sound like my ninth-grade teacher.

36:59.520 --> 37:03.638
There are dignitaries here
from 18 different worlds.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.274
It's a good sign.

37:05.400 --> 37:09.632
I wouldn't be surprised if this alliance
begins to expand before we know it.

37:10.120 --> 37:12.156
You should be very proud of yourself,
Captain.

37:12.280 --> 37:15.716
I'll be proud of myself
if I get this speech out in one piece.

37:15.840 --> 37:17.671
That's not what I meant.

37:18.840 --> 37:21.718
I know what you meant, Phlox,
and I appreciate it.

37:22.640 --> 37:24.278
But this is not about me.

37:24.400 --> 37:28.154
Why do so many humans refuse
to take credit where credit is due?

37:28.280 --> 37:32.114
There are times when
modesty and humility are quite illogical.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.757
Whenever you're ready, sir.

37:35.640 --> 37:39.076
Well, I've got three wives waiting.
I'd better go and join them.

37:40.520 --> 37:42.909
I'd wish you good luck, Captain...

37:43.520 --> 37:46.318
but you've always had an ample supply.

37:47.360 --> 37:48.759
Thank you, Doctor.

37:54.720 --> 37:56.438
You'd better get out there.

37:57.640 --> 37:59.870
You don't want to miss me
screwing this thing up.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.833
I'm going to remain down here,
if you don't mind.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.475
You never did like crowds, did you?

38:10.320 --> 38:13.790
You look very heroic.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.673
-ls he nervous?
-Wouldn't you be?

38:59.800 --> 39:01.392
He'll be fine.

39:01.520 --> 39:04.273
I had to memorise this speech
in grammar school.

39:05.520 --> 39:06.999
You wish you could tell them all...

39:07.120 --> 39:10.032
that this alliance
will give birth to the Federation.

39:11.560 --> 39:13.357
I think I'm ready
to talk to Captain Picard.

39:13.480 --> 39:15.789
I should have done it a long time ago.

39:16.360 --> 39:19.477
-So, I guess we're through here.
-I guess we are.

39:20.440 --> 39:21.793
Computer.

39:23.920 --> 39:25.114
End programme.

39:38.360 --> 39:41.397
Space--the final frontier.

39:41.840 --> 39:45.230
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

39:45.360 --> 39:47.316
Its continuing mission...

39:48.000 --> 39:50.798
to explore strange new worlds...

39:50.920 --> 39:54.117
to seek out new life
and new civilisations...

39:55.520 --> 39:59.035
to boldly go
where no man has gone before.
