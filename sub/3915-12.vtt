Previously on Beauty and the Beast:

00:03.520 --> 00:06.126
Ever hear of the Ellingsworihs?
They are protecting Liam.

00:06.280 --> 00:07.566
- He's...
- Using them.

00:07.720 --> 00:10.166
Liam saved me.
He saved our family.

00:10.320 --> 00:13.403
- No, he is a monster.
- He's my brother.

00:13.560 --> 00:15.722
Look, please, Mrs. Ellingsworih,
listen to me.

00:15.880 --> 00:17.564
- Holy crap.
- What? What is it?

00:17.720 --> 00:21.691
Liam's not Helen Ellingsworth's
brother, he's her ancestor.

00:21.840 --> 00:23.968
Look, that's a photo from
an old London newspaper.

00:24.120 --> 00:26.771
That's who Rebecca was engaged to
before Alistair,

00:26.920 --> 00:32.165
- and the chief suspect of their murders.
- Liam is the beast from 1854.

00:32.320 --> 00:36.006
We have so much in common,
you and I. The last of the pack.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.571
No, we're nothing alike.

00:37.720 --> 00:40.929
- You're a cold-blooded killer, Liam.
- And you're not? Let's face it.

00:41.080 --> 00:43.845

from being more like me is you.

I know we have to stop Liam, Heather,
but even if we do, I'm scared.

00:55.560 --> 00:58.325
I'm scared that Vincent's gonna
stay young while I grow old and die.

00:58.480 --> 01:00.369
How am I supposed to get married
to a man

01:00.520 --> 01:02.761

lam so sorry. I didn't see you.
Don't move. Let me call an ambulance.

01:20.920 --> 01:25.403
- Liam.
- You'll be dead soon.

- What?

[GASPS]

01:39.760 --> 01:42.127

I got you a double espresso.

You all right?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

01:44.720 --> 01:47.963
God, Cat, you've got to slow down.
You can't keep this up.

01:48.120 --> 01:51.681
No, I can't. We can't.
The more I look at Liam's history,

01:51.840 --> 01:53.922
the more scared
lam for the Ellingsworihs.

01:54.080 --> 01:56.765
He has gone through a lot of trouble
to get close to them.

01:56.920 --> 01:59.526
Whatever he's planning,
we have no idea how to stop him.

01:59.680 --> 02:02.251
- But won't the gem help?
- On his beast side, yeah.

02:02.400 --> 02:06.166
But not on his superhuman side.
It's one thing tracking him

02:06.320 --> 02:09.449
and figuring out his next move.
It's another, trying to stop him.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.762
- You're scared.
- No, I'm not...

02:11.920 --> 02:17.290
It's just, things are getting out of control,
and I am not great with "out of control."

02:17.440 --> 02:22.048
Oh, news flash. And you've got to let go
of this whole beast longevity thing, Cat.

02:22.200 --> 02:24.965
- You can't do anything about it.
- I'm not thinking about that.

02:25.120 --> 02:26.565
- You're not? Really?
- No.

02:26.720 --> 02:31.408
- So, what's this? Hmm.
- Okay, fine.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.210

02:33.360 --> 02:37.365
But none of that will be an issue
anyway if Liam kills all of us.

- Okay.

Did you see Liam?

02:46.120 --> 02:48.885
Yeah, more like sensed him. Hey.

02:49.040 --> 02:51.725
Whatever he's up to,
he's about to make his move.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.963
Not only has he completely
embedded himself in the entire family,

02:55.120 --> 02:58.249
but he's pretty much taken over
completely from Helen's son too.

02:58.400 --> 03:00.721
Why? If Liam wanted to kill them,
he already would have.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.201
- What's he waiting for?
- He wants them to suffer first,

03:03.360 --> 03:06.364
or at least know his suffering.
Problem is, I got no idea

03:06.520 --> 03:08.602
when he's gonna strike.
I really got to get to work

03:08.760 --> 03:10.762
and make an appearance
before I lose my job.

03:10.920 --> 03:12.763
Have you thought about
contacting Helen

03:12.920 --> 03:15.366
and maybe, you know,
warning her about Liam?

03:15.520 --> 03:19.002
Are you kidding? Last time I tried that,
Tess barely saved my job.

03:19.160 --> 03:21.811
What am I gonna say?
That Liam's ancestors abandoned him

03:21.960 --> 03:24.361
150 years ago,
and now he wants revenge?

03:24.520 --> 03:26.761
- It does sound a little ridiculous.
- A little?

03:26.920 --> 03:28.888
It's happening now.
We have to stop him.

03:29.040 --> 03:31.805
- Yeah, without killing Liam.
- I'm sorry, what? That's new.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.486
How do you stop a superhuman beast
without killing him?

03:34.640 --> 03:38.611
- I don't know but we need Liam alive.
- Actually, J.T. needs him alive.

03:38.760 --> 03:42.401
Liam's immune to serum poisoning,
so if we can get a sample of his blood,

03:42.560 --> 03:45.450
then maybe J.T. can figure out
how to use it to heal himself.

03:45.600 --> 03:49.127
Yeah, it may be his only hope,
which brings me back to stopping Liam.

03:49.280 --> 03:52.966
I've got an idea. Okay, all this
serum talk, it got me thinking.

03:53.120 --> 03:56.124
What if we do to Liam
what Reynolds did to me?

03:57.200 --> 03:59.043
Okay, we capture him with the gem,

03:59.200 --> 04:02.204
and then inject him with the same
mind-control concoction

04:02.360 --> 04:06.001
- that your father injected into me.
- You mean, erase Liam's memory?

04:06.160 --> 04:09.209
How can you have a vendetta
when you can't remember what it was?

04:09.360 --> 04:11.886
- Somebody want to catch me up here?
- It's nothing.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.610
My father erased Vincent's memory

04:13.760 --> 04:16.524
and turned him into a beast assassin.
You were in Miami.

04:16.680 --> 04:20.651
The point is, he made me forget, okay?
And if it wasn't for your sister's love,

04:20.800 --> 04:23.963
I never would've remembered who
I really was. Liam doesn't have that.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.646
He doesn't have that love,
so how can he remember?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.723
Not since Rebecca dumped him
for Alistair,

04:28.880 --> 04:30.769
which is, like,
why he killed them both.

04:30.920 --> 04:34.208
Okay, but Liam's pain, it's more raw.
It's more primal.

04:34.360 --> 04:37.887
It comes from when the Ellingsworths
abandoned him long before that.

04:38.040 --> 04:41.487
If your father can somehow
erase his deeper memories,

04:41.640 --> 04:43.642
then we can erase his entire drive.

04:44.840 --> 04:47.446
Catherine, if we want to stop Liam
without killing him,

04:47.600 --> 04:48.886
then this is our only hope.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.646
I don't know. We don't know
what my dad's formula was.

He's in prison.
Seems like the longest of long shots.

04:55.160 --> 04:56.889

we are destined to fight,

04:59.840 --> 05:02.207

but let's get it the hell over with.

any more time risking our lives,

We've been over this. There's nothing
you can do to help them.

05:33.160 --> 05:37.006

all the way upstate just for this?

10:26.640 --> 10:29.928
you have a curiously toxic amount
of thallium in your system.

10:30.080 --> 10:33.766
- Thallium?
- Yes. It was used as an insecticide,

10:33.920 --> 10:38.050
but because of its high levels
of toxicity, it's been banned for years.

10:38.200 --> 10:43.684
It's also been banned because
it's colourless and odourless,

Yes, I am.

and how long I am not.

38:43.880 --> 38:47.566
- Come on.
- I was letting it get to me.

38:47.720 --> 38:52.931
But to be honest, seeing how angry
and bitter Liam is without love,

38:53.080 --> 38:55.924
I don't know who's worse off,
me or you.

38:56.080 --> 38:58.082
Definitely me.

38:59.480 --> 39:03.371
Well, either way, there is nothing
that I can do about it.

39:04.920 --> 39:07.730
My father didn't wake up
yesterday morning

39:07.880 --> 39:09.723
thinking that it would be his last day.

39:10.520 --> 39:13.729
And I doubt that the Ellingsworths
thought it could be theirs, either.

39:13.880 --> 39:18.727
- You never know.
- No, you never know.

39:20.200 --> 39:22.248
But worrying about it,
trying to control it,

39:22.400 --> 39:24.846
trying to protect everything...

39:25.760 --> 39:29.367
Dad was right. If we want to have
any shot at stopping Liam,

39:29.520 --> 39:31.682
we have to let all of it go, all of it.

39:31.840 --> 39:33.922
If we want to have
our "happily ever after"...

39:34.080 --> 39:39.120
- Yeah, we got to go through Liam first.
- Yeah, now that he's coming after us.

39:40.360 --> 39:41.361
This is it.

39:42.960 --> 39:44.769
This is it.

39:45.440 --> 39:48.762
Hey. For Reynolds.

39:50.640 --> 39:52.005
For Dad.

39:53.305 --> 39:59.647
