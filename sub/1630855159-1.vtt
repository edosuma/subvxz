WEBVTT

00:18.101 --> 00:19.353
<i>Help!</i>

00:25.943 --> 00:27.611
Hey, over here!

00:28.779 --> 00:29.905
Over here!

00:36.203 --> 00:37.621
She's in there.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.848
<i>So tell me about the girl.</i>

00:59.893 --> 01:00.727
Well...

01:03.480 --> 01:05.440
actually never would have met her
if it weren't for you.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.359
So in a way,
this is kind of all your fault.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.112
Please enlighten me, Charlie.

01:13.699 --> 01:16.535
If I'm being a hundred percent totally
honest with you here, Dr. Altschul,

01:16.535 --> 01:22.249
these weekly sessions are not exactly
my favorite afternoon activity.

01:23.876 --> 01:27.880
<i>But last fall, my mom started
to let me drive into the city myself.</i>

01:27.880 --> 01:31.425
<i>Which meant, when we were done here,
I was free to wander.</i>

01:52.237 --> 01:53.655
<i>We went to high school together.</i>

01:55.240 --> 01:58.493
<i>Well, not together.
She was a year ahead of me,</i>

01:58.493 --> 02:00.704
<i>already graduated and started at NYU.</i>

02:01.496 --> 02:05.918
<i>It's not like we were friends or anything,
but she's just hard to forget.</i>

02:18.347 --> 02:19.348
I know you.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.518
Hey. How do I know you?

02:27.147 --> 02:29.191
I think we both went to Flower Hill High.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.944
Well, I mean I still do.

02:32.778 --> 02:34.530
Charles Weisbarger. Charlie's good.

02:35.280 --> 02:38.575
Well, Charles,
what are you doing all the way out here?

02:39.243 --> 02:42.329
I mean I--
What's anyone doing out here just

02:42.329 --> 02:44.122
getting the hell off Long Island, right?

02:45.999 --> 02:48.085
That is the right answer.

02:52.756 --> 02:55.050
<i>So, what's wrong with you?</i>

02:57.177 --> 02:58.428
Your doctor's appointment?

02:59.721 --> 03:02.516
- It's not that kind of doctor.
- Yeah. No shit.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.977
You're coming into the city solo.
It's got to be a shrink.

03:04.977 --> 03:06.812
Are your parents splitting up?

03:06.812 --> 03:09.106
That's when I had my first brush with
a mental health professional.

03:20.117 --> 03:22.327
My dad died last September. So...

03:22.327 --> 03:23.245
Yeah.

03:34.173 --> 03:35.549
Do you wanna see my zine?

03:36.633 --> 03:37.634
What's a zine?

03:41.013 --> 03:43.182
It's semi-autobiographical.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.434
Me, but not me.

03:46.727 --> 03:50.272
My photography, illustrations,
music reviews.

03:50.272 --> 03:52.566
These guys I know are in this band,

03:52.566 --> 03:54.443
and I'm trying
to document their whole scene,

03:54.443 --> 03:59.615
but they're kind of weird about photos
and privacy, so it's thinly veiled.

04:00.115 --> 04:02.159
Names changed to protect the guilty.

04:04.203 --> 04:05.871
This is amazing.

04:15.297 --> 04:17.841
I think us Flower Hill kids
need to stick together.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.803
From now on, Charles,
you're gonna be my project.

04:26.558 --> 04:29.520
<i>We met up every week after
I left here with you.</i>

04:30.020 --> 04:33.649
<i>And I guess that's when you could say
my real education began.</i>

05:11.687 --> 05:12.688
Come on.

05:18.819 --> 05:19.862
Sorry.

05:21.822 --> 05:22.990
You look good.

05:57.816 --> 06:00.652
<i>It was physically impossible
to be sad when she was around.</i>

06:16.627 --> 06:17.628
Really good.

06:17.628 --> 06:19.713
It's like a lot of other cool things,
but it's kind of like--

06:19.713 --> 06:21.131
Okay. I know. It's not done yet.

06:21.715 --> 06:22.716
Sorry.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.942
<i>Brass Tactics</i> was
the only album Ex Post Facto made

06:39.942 --> 06:41.443
before Billy Three-Sticks
broke up the band,

06:41.443 --> 06:43.278
before they ever had a chance to get big.

06:43.987 --> 06:44.988
And in a weird way,

06:44.988 --> 06:47.908
the fact that they only made
one album makes it even more special.

06:47.908 --> 06:51.328
- You must own it.
- No, I don't have any money.

06:51.328 --> 06:53.455
I mean, I could probably just
download it off LimeWire, right?

06:53.455 --> 06:55.582
No.

06:55.582 --> 06:59.044
Charles, that would deprive the band
of their well-earned royalties.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.004
- I'm buying.
- No.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.089
Yes.

07:05.384 --> 07:08.262
<i>That sounds like a
wonderful way to spend autumn in New York.</i>

07:09.638 --> 07:11.098
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

07:13.016 --> 07:17.104
Until it wasn't. Although I guess there's
no one to blame for that but me.

07:17.604 --> 07:20.023
Well, my mom, obviously.

07:20.023 --> 07:24.236
Didn't you tell me you stayed out all
night and then drove home in the morning,

07:24.236 --> 07:27.406
shirtless and vomiting from a hangover?

07:27.406 --> 07:28.490
Okay.

07:30.492 --> 07:34.746
Well-- I didn't exactly say it like that,
but yeah, sure.

07:34.746 --> 07:37.124
I mean, New Year's Eve, shit happens.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.001
And do you think your mother's decision

07:39.001 --> 07:41.211
to ground you for six months
was unreasonable?

07:41.211 --> 07:42.462
This isn't about my mom.

07:42.462 --> 07:46.550
This is about Sam and how I love her
and that maybe she loves me.

07:46.550 --> 07:48.260
And like, I don't know. I--

07:48.260 --> 07:50.345
But before I could even
figure all that out,

07:50.345 --> 07:52.347
I wasn't allowed to see her anymore, so--

07:54.725 --> 07:56.852
My story just stopped.

08:00.439 --> 08:03.192
<i>It's encouraging, Charlie,
that you can speak so clearly</i>

08:03.192 --> 08:04.735
<i>about your sense of loss.</i>

08:05.819 --> 08:07.779
<i>I just wish you would talk about</i>

08:07.779 --> 08:12.284
<i>the loss of your father
in the same perceptive way.</i>

08:15.662 --> 08:19.791
Do you think it's possible that
focusing on Samantha

08:19.791 --> 08:22.669
is a way of deflecting your feelings
about your dad?

08:24.713 --> 08:27.549
- ...<i>from the plane. Really?
- It's definitely a 737.</i>

08:28.967 --> 08:31.345
<i>Somebody hit
the World Trade Center. I don't know.</i>

08:32.304 --> 08:34.890
<i>What the hell is happening?</i>

08:35.890 --> 08:39.269
<i>It's easier to feel the way you feel</i>

08:39.937 --> 08:44.232
<i>about a vibrant young woman
living a few miles away</i>

08:44.983 --> 08:50.072
than it is to process the deep,
permanent loss of your father.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.450
...<i>exploded right now.
We got people all over here</i>

08:53.450 --> 08:55.160
<i>down in the middle of the street.</i>

08:55.160 --> 08:57.079
<i>Another hit. It just hit another building.</i>

08:57.079 --> 09:00.916
<i>Two aircraft crashed into
the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan.</i>

09:00.916 --> 09:04.044
- <i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>
- <i>We've got an explosion--</i>

09:04.044 --> 09:05.796
<i>Oh, my God. It must be a person.</i>

09:05.796 --> 09:07.339
- <i>Where?</i>
- <i>No, please.</i>

09:07.339 --> 09:09.132
- <i>Where?</i>
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>

09:09.132 --> 09:10.342
<i>Good Lord.</i>

09:12.553 --> 09:13.762
<i>There are no words.</i>

09:14.638 --> 09:18.392
<i>Hey, Charlie, it's Dad.
Something's happened.</i>

09:19.351 --> 09:21.019
<i>You've probably seen it on the news.</i>

09:22.145 --> 09:23.689
<i>I don't think I'll be coming home.</i>

09:25.148 --> 09:27.192
<i>I just want you to know I love you.</i>

09:34.241 --> 09:38.412
Trust me, doc,
there's nothing easy about it.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.341
- Hello.
- <i>Hey, stranger.</i>

09:51.925 --> 09:52.926
<i>You still grounded?</i>

09:52.926 --> 09:55.137
The answer better be "no"
because Ex Post Facto,

09:55.137 --> 09:57.598
who I hope in my absence
is still your favorite band,

09:57.598 --> 09:59.474
is reuniting for a concert on the Fourth.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.686
<i>I mean, it's not really a reunion
without Billy Three-Sticks,</i>

10:02.686 --> 10:05.272
and they changed the name,
but they're playing all their songs.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.982
It's going to be legendary.

10:06.982 --> 10:09.193
You'd basically kill yourself
if you missed it.

10:11.361 --> 10:12.362
<i>Hello?</i>

10:13.280 --> 10:16.658
- <i>Hello, Charles? Are you in?</i>
- Yes. Yes, of course.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.285
I-- Yeah, I wouldn't miss it.

10:19.161 --> 10:21.121
Okay, but?

10:21.121 --> 10:23.373
But, nothing.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.668
It's just we haven't really talked
in so long.

10:26.668 --> 10:29.713
I know. I tried calling you,
but you never called back.

10:30.255 --> 10:35.677
Yeah, sorry, I just didn't feel like
I had anything to say.

10:36.428 --> 10:39.932
No, I'm sorry for any role that I
may have played in your incarceration.

10:39.932 --> 10:41.892
No. Yeah.

10:41.892 --> 10:44.269
You know what? That was a time of real...

10:44.770 --> 10:46.980
real growth and introspection, so...

10:48.690 --> 10:50.984
I'm kidding. It sucked. I missed you.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.569
That makes me sad.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.613
But it also makes me very happy

10:54.613 --> 10:56.615
because I've missed
the hell out of you, Charles.

10:59.326 --> 11:03.956
Okay, I got to go, but details about the
Fourth of July shenanigans are to follow.

11:03.956 --> 11:05.832
- Bye.
- Nicky, hurry up!

11:05.832 --> 11:08.794
- Sammy. Let's go.
- Go, go, go.

11:08.794 --> 11:11.713
Holy shit!
You guys torched a fucking church?

11:11.713 --> 11:14.049
What'd you think we were doing?
Confessing our sins?

11:14.049 --> 11:15.884
Get in the car. Come on!

11:15.884 --> 11:18.220
- Ladies. Come on. What are we doing?
- Why did you do--

11:18.220 --> 11:20.430
Why did you target a fucking church?

11:20.430 --> 11:22.391
- Where's Nicky? Where's Nicky?
- I don't know.

11:22.391 --> 11:24.601
- Wait, we can't leave without Nicky.
- He's coming.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.979
- Nicky!
- What the fuck did you guys do?

11:26.979 --> 11:29.064
- Go. Come on!
- Come on. Let's move!

11:29.064 --> 11:31.984
- We can't leave without you.
- Hurry it up!

11:33.986 --> 11:36.154
She's a thing of beauty, isn't she?

11:36.154 --> 11:37.447
Let's go!

11:37.447 --> 11:39.074
We need to get the fuck outta here.

11:39.783 --> 11:41.952
Go! Step on it.

11:41.952 --> 11:43.161
Come on, Sam.

11:47.708 --> 11:52.671
<i>O beautiful for spacious skies</i>

11:52.671 --> 11:57.301
<i>For amber waves of grain</i>

11:57.301 --> 12:02.181
<i>For purple mountain majesties</i>

12:02.181 --> 12:07.102
<i>Above the fruited plain</i>

12:07.102 --> 12:09.521
<i>America--</i>

12:09.521 --> 12:11.315
Nishima Guptpa.

12:18.864 --> 12:20.824
Cate Hamilton-Sweeney Lamplighter.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.250
- Take care.
- Thank you so much.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.543
Yes. Yep. Bye-bye.

12:33.170 --> 12:36.048
Cate Hamilton-Sweeney Lamplighter,
her mother.

12:36.048 --> 12:38.592
- Can you point her out for me?
- Why?

12:38.592 --> 12:41.595
I think I might know her brother.

12:41.595 --> 12:44.223
- You know a Hamilton-Sweeney?
- Yeah.

12:44.973 --> 12:47.100
Impressive. Over there.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.314
That'll be great. She'll love that.

12:52.314 --> 12:55.150
But it's your place next time,
like, truly.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.110
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Hi.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.571
I just wanted to introduce myself.
Mercer Goodman.

12:59.571 --> 13:01.114
Nice to meet you. I'm-- Are--

13:01.114 --> 13:03.158
- Are you one of Cate's teachers?
- No.

13:03.158 --> 13:04.535
I'm a friend of--

13:05.744 --> 13:09.331
I think he might be your brother. William.

13:09.915 --> 13:12.376
Regan, come on. Kids are waiting.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.462
- I may have promised them gelato.
- Yeah.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.047
I'm sorry.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.969
Look, now is not a great time,
but it was really nice--

13:21.969 --> 13:25.430
It was really great to meet you,
Mr. Goodman.

13:31.186 --> 13:34.481
She's asleep, finally. She was so excited.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.566
Well done.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.278
Everything okay with you?
You seem a little distracted.

13:39.945 --> 13:43.615
I'm fine.
It's just I'm worried about Will.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.701
You know,
he's just not himself these days.

13:46.952 --> 13:50.581
He used to love the last day of school,
and I just, I don't get it.

13:50.581 --> 13:52.541
Yeah. He used to love a lot of things.

13:56.086 --> 13:57.087
Baseball cards.

13:57.796 --> 13:58.797
Pokémon.

14:01.175 --> 14:03.260
Pokémon. His parents.

14:07.181 --> 14:09.725
It's just a phase. He's a good kid.

15:00.609 --> 15:03.946
Are we gonna talk about how
you've been cheating on me?

15:07.783 --> 15:09.493
What? Cheating?

15:09.493 --> 15:14.790
Keith, the window where you could
bullshit your way out of this has closed.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.002
She wrote me a note.

15:21.797 --> 15:25.217
Not that I didn't already suspect though.

15:25.217 --> 15:29.096
Since when do you listen to
The Libertines? What is she, 25?

15:29.096 --> 15:31.306
Hold on.

15:32.182 --> 15:35.561
If you want to talk, let's talk.
But don't act like this is all my fault.

15:37.104 --> 15:40.023
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

15:40.023 --> 15:45.028
I missed the part where I cheated on you.
I had no idea that I had a boyfriend.

15:45.028 --> 15:48.115
Yeah, well, sometimes it feels like
you don't have a husband either.

15:48.699 --> 15:50.701
Does she find you fascinating?

15:51.535 --> 15:55.956
Is she so free-spirited
and totally fucking alive?

15:56.582 --> 15:58.250
Yeah, kind of.

16:02.921 --> 16:04.506
Does she have a job?

16:05.007 --> 16:09.303
Does she have two kids? A sick father?

16:09.887 --> 16:12.848
God, Keith, I was that girl. I--

16:13.432 --> 16:18.562
I was that girl, and I strangled her
so that we could have this.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.277
Fuck.

16:31.116 --> 16:32.284
Mr. Goodman.

16:35.370 --> 16:37.664
Hi, I'm glad I caught you.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.542
I was just dropping off a gift
to my kid's teacher,

16:40.542 --> 16:44.379
and I thought we could
finish our conversation or start it.

16:48.258 --> 16:49.384
You know my brother?

16:50.177 --> 16:53.889
Yes, William is a friend. A good friend.

16:54.389 --> 16:58.477
Although maybe not that good,
since until the other day,

16:58.477 --> 17:00.020
I didn't know he had a sister.

17:00.020 --> 17:02.773
Well, we haven't seen each other in years,

17:02.773 --> 17:07.903
so I didn't know if he was living in
the city still or dead.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.573
So, I'm relieved.

17:13.825 --> 17:17.579
Would you like to go
somewhere we can talk?

17:17.579 --> 17:21.250
I would love that more than you know.
But I have to go.

17:21.250 --> 17:24.002
I'm meeting movers at the house.

17:24.002 --> 17:26.380
Moving, that's always the worst.

17:26.380 --> 17:28.924
Yeah, especially when it's unplanned.

17:28.924 --> 17:30.634
Well, everything's okay I hope?

17:32.344 --> 17:33.554
Yeah, everything is shit.

17:33.554 --> 17:36.974
But thanks for asking. You're very sweet.

17:39.351 --> 17:44.106
Well, listen,
if you see him, before the Fourth,

17:46.441 --> 17:47.734
would you give him this?

17:48.527 --> 17:51.613
Yeah. Just tell him I miss him and that...

17:54.449 --> 17:56.410
a lot has changed.

17:57.953 --> 18:00.747
Yeah, just tell him
I really need him there this year.

18:00.747 --> 18:01.874
Of course.

18:01.874 --> 18:04.585
And I would love for you to come, Mercer.

18:06.795 --> 18:08.005
It was a pleasure meeting you.

18:09.548 --> 18:11.466
I'm glad William's got someone.

18:25.647 --> 18:29.985
Happy birthday, happy birthday.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.823
Oh, my gosh. These illustrations.

18:36.033 --> 18:37.367
Beautiful.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.578
And this-- This is us.

18:39.578 --> 18:42.247
Well, this is our courtship.

18:42.247 --> 18:44.082
If you can call it that.

18:44.082 --> 18:46.960
The weekend at Bruno's cabin.
This is my art show.

18:46.960 --> 18:51.256
This is just all those nights
we sat up on the roof, just talking, and...

18:52.049 --> 18:56.970
Come on. Gotta be some upside to
living with a narcissistic artist, right?

18:56.970 --> 18:58.055
Yeah.

18:58.055 --> 19:01.308
All right. Let's go. Open it.
There's a real present inside.

19:05.896 --> 19:08.857
William. Oh, my gosh.

19:09.900 --> 19:10.901
Thank you.

19:11.443 --> 19:16.949
Truly, you really did not have to
get me something so extravagant.

19:18.742 --> 19:19.743
Well,

19:20.577 --> 19:23.121
as an investment in your future,

19:24.498 --> 19:25.791
it came pretty cheap.

19:26.625 --> 19:27.626
I'm going out.

19:30.128 --> 19:31.839
On my birthday?

19:32.923 --> 19:36.343
I'm just gonna go to the studio
for a little bit. All right?

19:36.343 --> 19:39.680
I will be home before dinner. I promise.

19:39.680 --> 19:43.684
Come on, you can set up your new computer
and you can start that new novel of yours.

19:44.810 --> 19:46.103
Don't look at me like that.

19:46.103 --> 19:48.689
I'm not looking at you
in any particular way.

19:48.689 --> 19:51.650
It's just it is my first birthday
away from home.

19:51.650 --> 19:55.571
Right, as you've mentioned
a couple times now,

19:56.154 --> 19:57.155
and...

19:58.907 --> 20:04.079
I'm sorry if today is falling short
of whatever you had in your head,

20:04.079 --> 20:09.918
but does it strike you as revealing
that you still refer to Georgia as home?

20:11.003 --> 20:14.506
Home, as in where I came from.
At least I still talk about it.

20:14.506 --> 20:15.591
Right.

20:15.591 --> 20:20.470
'Cause you are just a man
of transparency and honesty.

20:21.722 --> 20:23.849
How do you describe me to your parents?

20:23.849 --> 20:26.560
What is it? Your roommate?

20:26.560 --> 20:29.313
Look, you don't understand.
It's not that easy.

20:30.814 --> 20:32.065
For them or for you?

20:36.737 --> 20:38.989
Please just tell me this
has nothing to do with that

20:38.989 --> 20:41.074
- fucking envelope that you keep shoving...
- All right.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.619
- ...into my field of vision.
- Will, are you ever going to open it?

20:43.619 --> 20:44.786
It is from your family.

20:44.786 --> 20:47.456
What I want to know is how
it got into our apartment.

20:47.456 --> 20:50.501
What I want to know
is why you don't talk to them.

20:50.501 --> 20:52.211
- They're so--
- Rich?

20:53.378 --> 20:56.089
I was gonna say nice.
At least your sister is.

20:58.050 --> 20:59.051
Okay.

21:01.637 --> 21:02.721
I'm going out.

21:05.307 --> 21:06.517
We're grown men, Merce.

21:07.893 --> 21:10.187
Birthdays are a little ridiculous
at our age.

21:37.256 --> 21:39.299
Hurry up.
You've been in there way too long.

21:40.342 --> 21:44.012
- He's been in there way too long.
- You worry too much. It's all good.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.348
It's all good.

21:46.932 --> 21:49.810
Wait. You filled up that whole thing?
You said my dad wouldn't notice.

21:49.810 --> 21:52.437
He won't. Plus, you said
he doesn't even work much anymore.

21:52.437 --> 21:54.773
- It's not like he needs it.
- Fuck, Sol.

21:54.773 --> 21:57.901
It's a victimless crime. I was never here.

21:59.653 --> 22:00.696
We were never here.

22:03.031 --> 22:04.449
Coming with?

22:04.449 --> 22:06.660
I got some shit to do.
I'll see you tonight.

22:11.915 --> 22:14.793
I hope we didn't just fuck up.
You took a lot.

22:14.793 --> 22:16.170
Her dad's a washed-up drunk.

22:16.753 --> 22:20.841
Yeah, but he and Sam are close.
And she knows how dangerous that shit is.

22:26.054 --> 22:29.391
Hey, I was hoping you'd call.
You might be ready to talk.

22:29.391 --> 22:33.061
Why?
Because you have some new and profound

22:33.061 --> 22:35.606
insights you'd like to share
on your behavior?

22:35.606 --> 22:37.566
More like I missed your voice.

22:37.566 --> 22:38.650
<i>Stop.</i>

22:39.193 --> 22:40.944
It's been a crazy couple of weeks.

22:41.528 --> 22:44.072
I'm just calling to see what time
you're coming to my dad's tonight.

22:45.199 --> 22:47.618
- I didn't think you wanted me to go.
- <i>I don't.</i>

22:47.618 --> 22:50.913
But we go every year and you were invited.

22:51.455 --> 22:54.833
<i>Oh, shit, Reggie.
You haven't told him yet.</i>

22:54.833 --> 22:56.710
No, because it should be in person.

22:56.710 --> 22:59.713
And Dad's in Minneapolis at the clinic.
I didn't want to bother him.

22:59.713 --> 23:02.090
Or you're still hoping we can work it out?

23:02.716 --> 23:05.302
<i>You're delusional, like, truly delusional.</i>

23:05.969 --> 23:07.137
Maybe I'm an optimist?

23:07.137 --> 23:09.306
Or maybe you're hoping
that I'll forgive you

23:09.306 --> 23:11.558
so that you don't have
to be the bad guy anymore.

23:11.558 --> 23:14.645
I fucked up.
Doesn't mean it has to be forever.

23:14.645 --> 23:18.106
You fucked up?

23:18.690 --> 23:21.902
Fucking up is locking
your keys in the car.

23:21.902 --> 23:24.738
Fucking up is leaving
your theater tickets at home.

23:24.738 --> 23:27.199
<i>It does not begin
to describe what you did.</i>

23:27.199 --> 23:29.159
What you've done to us.

23:29.159 --> 23:33.914
Keith, if you'd ever been to therapy,
or read a self-help book,

23:33.914 --> 23:36.458
or googled,
"Why am I such a fucking asshole,"

23:36.458 --> 23:39.586
then maybe you'd understand
why there's no fixing this.

23:39.586 --> 23:43.382
<i>I did a terrible thing, but I love you.
I love our kids.</i>

23:43.382 --> 23:45.717
If you want me to go to therapy,
I'll go to therapy.

23:45.717 --> 23:50.556
Keith, tonight I'm going to tell my father
that I'm ending my marriage.

23:51.223 --> 23:53.475
You are welcome
to be a part of that conversation.

23:53.475 --> 23:54.768
I'm not trying to bury you.

23:54.768 --> 23:58.188
Reggie, he knows the only reason you'd
end our marriage is if I cheated on you.

23:58.188 --> 24:03.026
You ended our marriage
and I can't control what he thinks.

24:03.861 --> 24:05.070
This conversation was pointless.

24:05.988 --> 24:08.365
- <i>Are you gonna be there or not?</i>
- Yeah. I'll be there.

24:08.365 --> 24:09.825
I'll see you later.

24:37.811 --> 24:39.479
<i>Attention, passengers.</i>

24:44.568 --> 24:48.947
I don't believe it.
Billy fucking Three-Sticks.

24:48.947 --> 24:50.073
Solomon Grungy.

24:50.657 --> 24:53.035
Of all the terminals in the world, huh?

24:54.661 --> 24:57.080
What you got in that bag?
Is there a body in there?

24:57.080 --> 24:58.248
Anyone I know?

24:58.749 --> 25:02.127
It's hockey practice.
Only free ice is in Queens.

25:02.711 --> 25:04.755
How you doing? How's Nicky?

25:04.755 --> 25:07.216
Why is it that every time someone
sees me, they ask how Nicky's doing?

25:07.216 --> 25:10.469
As a pleasantry. That's all.
Half-assed, by the way.

25:11.136 --> 25:14.306
Come on. I just want to know how y'all
are surviving without the band.

25:15.807 --> 25:16.934
Nicky hasn't reached out?

25:17.434 --> 25:18.810
No. Why would he?

25:20.103 --> 25:23.941
We booked a gig at Don Hill's tonight.

25:24.525 --> 25:26.068
Getting the band back together.

25:26.902 --> 25:28.654
Calling it Ex Nihilo.

25:28.654 --> 25:30.864
With a flyer? Wow.

25:32.366 --> 25:35.702
That is a shitty idea,
with an even shittier name.

25:36.912 --> 25:38.247
Put you on the list?

25:38.247 --> 25:40.457
Fourth of July, Sol. I got plans.

25:41.458 --> 25:42.459
- Hi.
- Big plans.

25:42.459 --> 25:43.585
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:44.419 --> 25:46.004
Cruising the train station?

25:46.004 --> 25:49.258
Show up tonight. You might be surprised.

25:51.718 --> 25:54.638
That was Billy Three-Sticks.
You could've introduced me.

25:55.973 --> 25:56.974
No.

25:57.474 --> 25:58.559
Why not?

26:12.990 --> 26:14.533
You agreed you wouldn't call me anymore.

26:15.450 --> 26:16.451
We need to talk.

26:17.077 --> 26:18.912
Don't worry, I'm not pregnant or anything.

26:18.912 --> 26:21.790
But it's important,
and it has to be in person.

26:22.457 --> 26:23.500
Now's not a good time.

26:23.500 --> 26:25.836
Okay. Well, then, later tonight?

26:25.836 --> 26:28.755
<i>Tonight I have to go to a party
at my father-in-law's,</i>

26:28.755 --> 26:30.299
where he'll undoubtedly discover

26:30.299 --> 26:32.926
that I cheated on his daughter
with a college student.

26:32.926 --> 26:34.428
<i>Okay. Meet me before the party.</i>

26:34.428 --> 26:37.806
Don Hill's at 9:00 p.m.
Spring and Greenwich. It's a club.

26:38.473 --> 26:40.851
<i>No, we have nothing to talk about.</i>

26:40.851 --> 26:43.854
Okay. If you don't come to me,
then I'm gonna have to come to you.

26:43.854 --> 26:44.938
Samantha, don't do that.

26:44.938 --> 26:46.857
<i>You showed me where the building was
that time we went to the Met.</i>

26:46.857 --> 26:50.360
Please don't do that. Please.
Please, stay away from me and my family.

26:50.360 --> 26:53.989
I already told you, I'm not the one
who sent that note to your wife.

26:53.989 --> 26:56.325
But I think that I might know who did.

26:56.325 --> 26:59.286
<i>There are people who don't want us
to be together and</i>

26:59.286 --> 27:01.413
I didn't tell you before
because I didn't understand.

27:01.413 --> 27:03.540
But now I'm starting to,

27:03.540 --> 27:06.251
and I'm really worried
that something bad is gonna happen.

27:06.251 --> 27:08.462
<i>Yeah, something bad has already happened.</i>

27:08.462 --> 27:10.797
What can be worse than
blowing up my marriage?

27:14.343 --> 27:15.969
Blowing up something else.

27:39.284 --> 27:40.786
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, it's me.</i>

27:40.786 --> 27:44.248
So, something has come up.

27:44.248 --> 27:48.460
<i>And I kind of
need to see this band tonight.</i>

27:48.460 --> 27:53.465
It's my band actually, minus me
and anyone else that fucking matters.

27:54.341 --> 27:57.261
I thought we were going to Battery Park
to watch the fireworks.

27:57.261 --> 28:00.472
Hey, come with me.
Come with me. Come on, please.

28:01.056 --> 28:03.892
<i>Babe? I can't not be there for this.</i>

28:03.892 --> 28:08.480
I have to see this fucking travesty
unfold with my own two eyes.

28:10.482 --> 28:15.487
You know, I'm feeling just a little
under the weather.

28:15.487 --> 28:18.657
Achy, fluey. Have you read about SARS?

28:18.657 --> 28:20.701
- <i>I wouldn't wanna infect anyone.</i>
- Oh, my God.

28:20.701 --> 28:22.870
You do not have SARS, Merce.

28:23.495 --> 28:25.873
<i>Okay, fine. Just stay home,</i>

28:25.873 --> 28:31.003
be good to yourself
and drink lots of fluids.

28:31.003 --> 28:33.046
<i>And I'll see you later. Okay?</i>

28:33.630 --> 28:35.340
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

29:24.348 --> 29:25.349
Sam!

29:26.350 --> 29:27.476
Hi.

29:33.524 --> 29:34.525
Hi.

29:36.944 --> 29:37.945
Are you ready for tonight?

29:38.487 --> 29:41.740
Yes. I'm ready for anything. Everything.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.663
So do you have the tickets, or--

29:48.413 --> 29:50.624
Tickets for what? For the train?

29:51.500 --> 29:53.043
For Ex Post Facto.

29:54.002 --> 29:56.255
It's not the opera, rookie.
There are no tickets.

29:56.922 --> 29:58.173
Also, it's Ex Nihilo now.

29:59.925 --> 30:01.927
God, what did you do without me?

30:04.930 --> 30:06.515
Wait, sorry. Can you hold on?

30:07.099 --> 30:09.393
- Can you wait? I need to--
- Hurry up. Our train's in 20 minutes.

30:09.393 --> 30:11.144
- Our train's in 20 minutes.
- Sorry, I'm coming.

30:15.732 --> 30:16.775
Hey, Will?

30:18.318 --> 30:19.486
Will?

30:22.656 --> 30:25.868
- What?
- Mrs. Santos is on her way.

30:25.868 --> 30:30.205
Legally, she's in charge, but can you
just keep an eye on your sister, please?

30:30.205 --> 30:32.541
Guys, look at the bird.

30:38.338 --> 30:41.884
Wow, Cate. That is beautiful.

30:43.093 --> 30:44.803
Is Dad gonna be at the party?

30:44.803 --> 30:46.597
Yeah, that's the plan.

30:47.347 --> 30:48.724
Don't get back together with him.

30:51.185 --> 30:56.190
Will, you know that
your dad loves you so much.

30:56.773 --> 31:00.152
And none of this
has anything to do with you.

31:00.819 --> 31:04.656
No shit. Say hi to Grandpa for me.

31:04.656 --> 31:05.741
N--

31:10.913 --> 31:13.165
Hey, so, where's your camera?

31:14.124 --> 31:17.544
I mean, surely you're gonna wanna document
the band's reunion for your zine, right?

31:17.544 --> 31:18.921
Camera's missing.

31:19.546 --> 31:22.341
Oh, shit. What happened to it?

31:23.842 --> 31:26.512
If I knew that, it wouldn't be missing,
would it?

31:27.554 --> 31:29.348
Right. But, you lost it,
or someone took it, or--

31:29.348 --> 31:31.183
Jesus Christ, Charles.
I said I don't know.

31:40.859 --> 31:43.111
<i>The next stop is Canal Street.</i>

31:46.490 --> 31:48.909
Sam? Are you okay?

31:51.411 --> 31:53.413
You know, you're the only one
who ever asks me that.

32:09.805 --> 32:12.224
- I don't have ID.
- You don't need an ID. You're with me.

32:13.976 --> 32:16.770
- Hi.
- I knew we'd be seeing you tonight, Sammy.

32:16.770 --> 32:19.815
- Who's the beanpole?
- This is Charles, my protégé.

32:19.815 --> 32:21.984
- Hi.
- Don't judge. He's a work in progress.

32:21.984 --> 32:23.861
Your friends are my friends.

32:23.861 --> 32:25.195
I was hoping you'd say that.

32:25.195 --> 32:28.532
Charles, do you think you would be
okay on your own for an hour?

32:28.532 --> 32:32.119
- I have to go uptown.
- What the fuck, Sam?

32:32.119 --> 32:33.620
I thought you wanted to
spend tonight with me.

32:33.620 --> 32:35.289
I do. I really do.

32:35.289 --> 32:38.500
I just-- There's a problem that I have
to deal with, and it can't really wait.

32:39.585 --> 32:41.461
If I'm not back in an hour, come find me.

32:42.004 --> 32:43.505
By the park, 5th and 73rd.

32:46.216 --> 32:47.301
Bye.

33:22.085 --> 33:23.086
Thanks.

33:37.309 --> 33:39.978
Regan, you look wonderful.

33:39.978 --> 33:43.398
- Fabulous party. Congratulations, Felicia.
- Thank you.

33:43.398 --> 33:46.360
Where's Daddy? I want to hear
how everything went at the clinic.

33:46.360 --> 33:49.655
Healthwise, the news is good.
He passed all his tests.

33:49.655 --> 33:51.156
So it's not dementia?

33:51.156 --> 33:53.992
He's holding at a level where
nothing needs to change.

33:53.992 --> 33:55.953
He's very pleased this won't affect work.

33:55.953 --> 33:57.913
- Please be happy for him.
- I will. Where is he?

33:57.913 --> 34:00.207
Unfortunately, there was
a lightning storm in Minneapolis,

34:00.207 --> 34:01.875
and the G4 is grounded, so--

34:02.709 --> 34:03.919
Where's your handsome husband?

34:04.920 --> 34:07.005
He's coming. Soon, I think.

34:07.005 --> 34:12.177
I should probably tell you that
we're separating-- That we have separated.

34:12.761 --> 34:15.806
I'm wondering if this is why
your Uncle Amory is looking for you.

34:15.806 --> 34:17.933
Well, I don't know how Amory would know.

34:17.933 --> 34:19.434
We haven't told anyone.

34:19.434 --> 34:21.520
You know, Amory has a way
of finding out everything.

34:23.938 --> 34:26.400
- Fabulous to see you.
- Yeah. Okay.

34:26.400 --> 34:29.360
Do find Uncle Amory. He's adamant
about speaking with you tonight.

34:29.360 --> 34:30.654
Yeah, I will.

34:45.460 --> 34:47.713
I think you're standing on
someone's jacket.

34:48.380 --> 34:50.299
No. That's mine.

34:52.050 --> 34:54.386
Yeah. I've been watching you.

34:55.971 --> 34:58.724
I like how you dance,
like you don't give a shit.

34:59.474 --> 35:00.684
Thank you.

35:01.685 --> 35:03.103
So, are you holding?

35:03.687 --> 35:06.231
'Cause whatever you're on,
I definitely want some.

35:08.400 --> 35:10.194
Sorry. Fresh out.

35:10.194 --> 35:12.779
Bummer.
Would have made it worth your while.

35:18.493 --> 35:20.829
Hey, I could probably get you backstage
after the show.

35:20.829 --> 35:21.914
I'm with the band.

35:21.914 --> 35:23.123
Yeah?

35:24.875 --> 35:25.876
Come on.

35:37.137 --> 35:38.555
Yeah!

35:54.446 --> 35:57.157
<i>Brass tactics
This shit's never free</i>

35:57.157 --> 36:00.744
<i>Everybody's inside
Taking what they need</i>

36:01.286 --> 36:04.498
<i>Curse Catholics
Now pass me that collection basket</i>

36:04.498 --> 36:07.376
<i>I'd take the cash tip
Any day of the week</i>

36:09.837 --> 36:11.171
<i>Ooh</i>

36:12.756 --> 36:14.007
<i>Ooh</i>

36:16.552 --> 36:17.970
<i>Brass tactics</i>

36:19.721 --> 36:21.265
<i>Fuck the masses</i>

36:35.112 --> 36:36.780
All right, boss. We're here.

36:37.656 --> 36:39.533
Yeah, no-- Just keep going.

36:39.533 --> 36:41.159
Keep going. Just keep going.

36:41.159 --> 36:42.244
All right.

36:47.666 --> 36:50.752
- Oh, no, I'm not-- I'm, I wasn't--
- Thank you.

36:51.503 --> 36:53.213
Apologies. I thought you were waiting.

36:53.839 --> 36:56.133
I'm waiting, just not for the bus.

36:59.219 --> 37:01.430
Not exactly sure what I'm waiting for.

37:02.097 --> 37:04.892
A sign, maybe?
That's what I'm always waiting for.

37:06.977 --> 37:12.024
How about I be yours? You can be mine.

37:12.941 --> 37:16.111
Let's just be reassured that we are
exactly where we are supposed to be.

37:17.571 --> 37:18.572
Okay.

37:20.157 --> 37:21.366
I like that.

37:22.284 --> 37:25.662
Then I am going to keep my butt
firmly rooted to this bench.

37:26.830 --> 37:30.709
I will cross the street
into an unknown world.

37:32.336 --> 37:34.213
You only live once, right?

37:34.755 --> 37:37.466
Once is enough, if you do it right.

37:52.564 --> 37:54.650
<i>From the deck

37:54.650 --> 37:56.485

38:21.718 --> 38:22.719
Mercer.

38:25.097 --> 38:27.558
Wait. You got him to come?

38:27.558 --> 38:29.601
Where is he? Where is William?

38:29.601 --> 38:34.022
I'm sorry to say he did not make it.
Although his suit did.

38:36.650 --> 38:39.319
White linen. You wear it well.

38:40.070 --> 38:42.322
Well, what are you doing in here?

38:43.115 --> 38:46.285
Apparently, even William's fine tailoring

38:46.994 --> 38:50.497
can't keep the other guests
from mistaking me for a waiter.

38:51.123 --> 38:52.124
Three times.

38:53.500 --> 38:54.918
Why are you hiding in here?

38:57.462 --> 39:02.301
Because I'm drunk and currently drinkless.

39:02.301 --> 39:05.804
Oh, Regan--
No, you should let me help you there.

39:05.804 --> 39:08.390
No, it's okay. I got it.
It's fine. Just fine. I'll be a second.

39:08.390 --> 39:11.435
Okay. Regan, please. Just let me-- Okay.

39:11.977 --> 39:13.979
Okay. Let me help please. Let me--

39:13.979 --> 39:17.441
- That was so stupid.
- Here we go. Just put that under there.

39:17.441 --> 39:21.320
Former Boy Scout coming out.
Well, Eagle Scout, actually.

39:22.863 --> 39:26.950
- Sorry.
- Yes. Okay.

39:26.950 --> 39:28.285
Got you here.

39:31.038 --> 39:32.289
Doesn't hurt too bad, does it?

39:32.289 --> 39:34.124
No. It's okay.

39:34.124 --> 39:38.629
But I do have something for the pain.

39:41.840 --> 39:43.050
In here?

39:43.634 --> 39:45.260
No, of course not.

39:45.260 --> 39:46.637
We got to go outside.

39:49.181 --> 39:55.854
<i>I was standing on the corner

39:55.854 --> 40:02.152
<i>And I ain't got no reason

40:02.152 --> 40:05.948
<i>Real, real, real casual</i>

40:05.948 --> 40:08.033
<i>Away from here</i>

40:08.033 --> 40:12.621
<i>And I ain't got no reason to get up</i>

40:12.621 --> 40:15.874
<i>And get</i>

40:23.590 --> 40:26.593
<i>Get up off my knees</i>

40:29.429 --> 40:32.391
<i>To get up off my knees</i>

40:34.017 --> 40:38.564
<i>This city's on fire
Like someone committing suicide</i>

40:47.865 --> 40:48.866
- Come on.
- Wait.

40:48.866 --> 40:51.451
- I think I'm supposed to meet someone.
- Come on.

40:55.747 --> 40:56.999
He's with me. Cool?

40:57.583 --> 40:59.459
Yeah, cool. No problem.

40:59.459 --> 41:00.836
Thank you.

41:07.384 --> 41:09.553
Holy shit, Nicky.

41:09.553 --> 41:11.221
That was intense.

41:11.722 --> 41:15.100
You guys were so good.
Billy wishes he was ever that good.

41:15.100 --> 41:17.895
- You never saw Billy live.
- Whatever.

41:17.895 --> 41:19.229
I'll take the praise.

41:38.540 --> 41:41.335
Are you gonna join us, kid,
or you just gonna watch?

41:41.335 --> 41:44.254
- Stop.
- Which do you want me to do?

41:45.172 --> 41:46.715
I love this dude.

41:47.674 --> 41:49.343
- Come here. You.
- Come on.

41:49.343 --> 41:50.427
- Yeah.
- Yeah, oka--

41:51.637 --> 41:53.597
Someone get his skinny ass a beer.

41:54.306 --> 41:56.850
So, how do you know our young friend here?

41:56.850 --> 41:58.310
We just met.

41:58.310 --> 42:00.062
Sewer Girl's always making new friends.

42:00.062 --> 42:01.522
Just watch out for her boyfriend.

42:01.522 --> 42:03.732
He's got a mean streak
and a metal plate in his jaw.

42:05.901 --> 42:07.778
- Wha-- Thank you.
- Here.

42:08.820 --> 42:10.239
What happened to your jaw?

42:10.239 --> 42:11.323
Nicky?

42:11.823 --> 42:13.992
- He's not my boyfriend.
- What?

42:13.992 --> 42:15.244
I am.

42:15.953 --> 42:17.955
Who the fuck's the skinny kid
drinking all the beer?

42:17.955 --> 42:22.084
This is--

42:23.752 --> 42:24.753
Charlie. Hi.

42:24.753 --> 42:27.172
- This is Charlie. Hi. Hmm?
- Charlie.

42:28.966 --> 42:33.595
I've seen you before, Charlie.
New Year's Eve. You're Sam's friend.

42:36.598 --> 42:39.893
Yeah. That night was kind of a blur,
but yeah. It could be.

42:39.893 --> 42:42.688
- Wait. You didn't say you knew Sam.
- Well, I-- You didn't ask.

42:42.688 --> 42:44.898
I mean-- But yeah, we're, like,
basically best friends.

42:44.898 --> 42:46.108
So Sam's not here?

42:46.108 --> 42:48.193
- There's no way she'd miss this.
- No.

42:48.193 --> 42:51.280
She didn't want to. I mean,
we came here together and stuff,

42:51.280 --> 42:53.365
but she said she had to do
something uptown.

42:55.367 --> 42:58.996
Do you guys know the fastest way
to get to 5th and 73rd?

42:58.996 --> 43:00.998
I'm supposed to meet her there.

43:01.748 --> 43:03.458
Steal a car and drive.

43:09.131 --> 43:11.633
Hey, SG, they're playing our song.

43:12.134 --> 43:14.469
- Come on.
- Yeah.

43:17.806 --> 43:19.016
Bye, Nicky.

43:22.853 --> 43:24.479
You had a great show tonight.

43:25.230 --> 43:26.899
I don't want to be, like, weird about it.

43:26.899 --> 43:29.026
I don't wanna be weird about it.

43:33.322 --> 43:35.741
- Yeah, I'll go. I--
- You're not going anywhere.

43:37.326 --> 43:39.703
Come on, Charlie Man. Come with me.

43:40.662 --> 43:42.289
- Really?
- Yeah. After you, sir.

43:43.040 --> 43:44.041
To where?

43:44.541 --> 43:47.419
- Just follow me. I got you. Yeah?
- Okay, yeah.

43:57.095 --> 43:58.514
You ever done coke before, Charlie?

43:59.264 --> 44:01.475
Yeah. One time. Yeah.

44:01.475 --> 44:02.768
Have at it.

44:03.560 --> 44:04.561
Yeah.

44:08.774 --> 44:09.816
Like this, Scarface.

44:09.816 --> 44:13.612
Nicholas. Nicholas.

44:15.697 --> 44:17.407
Billy Three-Sticks. Holy shit.

44:17.407 --> 44:19.243
I knew you couldn't stay away.

44:19.243 --> 44:21.620
Just had to make sure you weren't
ruining my good name.

44:21.620 --> 44:23.664
We have our own name.

44:23.664 --> 44:29.461
Ex Nihilo. Means "out of nothing,"
like the way God fashioned life.

44:29.461 --> 44:31.046
Jesus fucking Christ.

44:31.672 --> 44:33.257
I am so glad that I don't have to listen

44:33.257 --> 44:35.843
to your pretentious
fucking bullshit anymore.

44:36.468 --> 44:37.678
Come here.

44:41.098 --> 44:43.183
You know, that wasn't half bad out there.

44:43.183 --> 44:44.893
I actually kinda liked it.

44:44.893 --> 44:46.395
I did. I liked it.

44:48.647 --> 44:50.232
I'm so sorry.

44:50.232 --> 44:52.317
The two of you guys meeting up like this--

44:52.317 --> 44:55.279
I've read Sam's zine
about the history of this band and,

44:55.279 --> 44:57.114
I mean, this just-- this is totally epic.

44:57.114 --> 44:59.783
She's going to shit herself
when I tell her.

44:59.783 --> 45:01.994
Oh, God. I should go meet up with her.

45:01.994 --> 45:04.079
She's probably waiting for me.

45:12.087 --> 45:14.214
Who the fuck was that guy? Huh?

45:20.262 --> 45:23.348
Thanks for coming down, Billy.
It means a lot.

45:27.311 --> 45:30.314
<i>So, what's the deal with you and William?</i>

45:31.356 --> 45:34.526
- "Deal"?
- Oh, come on.

45:34.526 --> 45:38.155
He's my brother.
Do you live together? Is it serious?

45:38.739 --> 45:42.284
It is to me. Is it to William?

45:43.702 --> 45:45.454
That I do not know.

45:45.454 --> 45:50.584
He keeps so much to himself.
His past, his family, his feelings.

45:51.543 --> 45:53.128
He's careless with words.

45:53.921 --> 45:55.923
Told me he loved me
on the first night we met,

45:55.923 --> 45:59.092
when he knew it wouldn't mean anything.

46:00.719 --> 46:03.347
Well, that's classic William.

46:05.182 --> 46:07.184
Now you can't say he never said it.

46:07.184 --> 46:10.437
But I can never know what he means by it.

46:11.939 --> 46:13.565
So why'd you come here tonight?

46:16.109 --> 46:18.362
Because I knew it would piss him off.

46:19.655 --> 46:20.656
Why'd you invite me?

46:20.656 --> 46:22.866
Same, you know?

46:26.245 --> 46:27.329
Here's to us.

47:04.408 --> 47:05.409
Hello?

47:12.708 --> 47:13.709
Hello?

47:19.673 --> 47:20.674
Hello?

47:27.890 --> 47:28.891
Hi.

47:35.856 --> 47:39.359
Regan Hamilton-Sweeney Lamplighter,

47:40.611 --> 47:41.820
you are a badass.

47:43.780 --> 47:46.283
Please drop the "Lamplighter." I have.

47:46.283 --> 47:49.703
And don't judge me.
I hardly ever touch this stuff.

47:50.287 --> 47:51.288
Of course.

47:54.750 --> 47:56.460
That must be the fireworks,

47:56.460 --> 47:59.755
which means Felicia's show
is starting soon.

48:00.923 --> 48:02.799
No. Those were definitely gunshots.

48:02.799 --> 48:04.968
No, it's the Upper East Side.

48:04.968 --> 48:07.888
I'm from the South. We know guns.

48:09.264 --> 48:10.474
The bleeding stopped.

48:12.768 --> 48:14.895
Now it's time for the real pain to begin.

48:15.729 --> 48:18.106
My step-uncle, Amory, has summoned me.

48:18.106 --> 48:22.110
Or as William and I
used to call him: the demon brother.

48:22.778 --> 48:23.612
Come on.

48:23.612 --> 48:25.739
- You can see why William stays away.
- Do you need help?

48:25.739 --> 48:26.657
- No.
- Okay.

48:26.657 --> 48:30.536
- The invitation said "white."
- White.

48:30.536 --> 48:33.956
But then he's wearing beige,
and that's fully gray--

48:33.956 --> 48:37.918
Oh, Lily, sorry. Sorry, Lily.

48:37.918 --> 48:39.461
- No, you're good.
- Okay.

48:39.461 --> 48:40.754
There he is.

48:42.172 --> 48:43.173
Excuse me.

48:44.299 --> 48:46.802
Regan, light of my life.

48:46.802 --> 48:50.180
Finally, I'm basking in the glow
of my favorite step-niece.

48:51.515 --> 48:55.227
Amory Gould,
allow me to introduce Mercer Goodman.

48:55.227 --> 48:59.690
Mr. Goodman.
I wasn't aware Regan was bringing a guest.

48:59.690 --> 49:01.233
You bounce back quick.

49:01.942 --> 49:03.819
We know each other from school.

49:03.819 --> 49:05.028
A student?

49:05.028 --> 49:07.489
Teacher, but I'm also a writer.

49:07.489 --> 49:09.199
Have you written anything
I might have read?

49:09.199 --> 49:12.995
A novel, roman à clef,
perhaps a piece in the <i>New Yorker</i>?

49:12.995 --> 49:15.664
I must admit I don't get to the fiction
in every issue,

49:15.664 --> 49:18.667
but I do love the illustrations.

49:20.169 --> 49:22.379
I haven't written anything
you might have read,

49:22.379 --> 49:24.256
or anybody else for that matter.

49:24.965 --> 49:27.843
But I'm planning to soon.

49:30.220 --> 49:32.639
Regan, he's delightful.
He's so full of optimism.

49:32.639 --> 49:35.767
You know, I too once considered myself
a bit of a writer.

49:35.767 --> 49:38.812
Unfortunately,
what I churned out was mostly excrement

49:38.812 --> 49:44.193
studded with a few indigestible kernels
of what once passed for wit.

49:44.193 --> 49:47.237
But you know, setting my notebooks aflame...

49:48.197 --> 49:52.117
That was the moment
when I realized I was an adult.

49:55.662 --> 50:01.502
Wow. Excuse me.
It's very nice to meet you.

50:01.502 --> 50:02.586
Likewise.

50:07.591 --> 50:10.802
No one knows how to dismantle
a person quite like you do.

50:10.802 --> 50:13.555
Well, coming from you, Regan,
that almost seems like a compliment.

50:13.555 --> 50:14.806
It's not.

50:15.599 --> 50:17.601
Wait. We have to talk.

50:17.601 --> 50:18.977
- About what?
- About your father.

50:18.977 --> 50:20.979
I know. He passed his tests.

50:20.979 --> 50:22.439
Yes, it was a great relief,

50:22.439 --> 50:26.235
but it's not really much of a benefit
when it's time for him to stand trial.

50:27.611 --> 50:28.612
What do you mean, "trial"?

50:30.239 --> 50:31.573
There's no way to sugarcoat this.

50:31.573 --> 50:34.701
Tomorrow, when your father gets
off the plane, he's going to be arrested.

50:35.869 --> 50:36.912
Arrested for what?

50:36.912 --> 50:41.708
Financial crimes. Undervaluing certain
assets for tax purposes.

50:41.708 --> 50:44.253
Overvaluing them to secure loans.

50:44.253 --> 50:47.172
The bank blew the whistle to the feds.

50:47.172 --> 50:50.384
Daddy would never.
It's some kind of a mistake.

50:51.218 --> 50:54.346
- Someone else's wrongdoing.
- His signature is on the checks.

50:54.346 --> 50:57.766
It's his family name on the buildings.
If they take one, they can take them all.

50:57.766 --> 51:01.103
Now, as his daughter
and the COO of this company,

51:01.103 --> 51:03.480
we need you to set the tone.

51:04.982 --> 51:08.277
All right? I'm gonna gather
a few trusted advisers tomorrow.

51:08.277 --> 51:13.156
We're gonna set up some bullet points.
We need a united front.

51:34.011 --> 51:35.012
No!

51:37.264 --> 51:40.934
Just go home.

52:02.873 --> 52:03.874
Hello?

52:07.628 --> 52:09.046
Is there anybody in there?

52:13.050 --> 52:14.051
Hello?

52:25.354 --> 52:26.438
Oh, my God.

52:33.445 --> 52:36.573
Help! Help!

52:46.166 --> 52:48.001
Hello? Yes, I need help.

52:48.001 --> 52:51.255
There's been a shooting in Central Park.

52:51.255 --> 52:56.301
I'm off of 5th and seventy-something,
on the East Side.

52:56.802 --> 52:58.637
Please,
can you just come as soon as you can?

52:58.637 --> 53:00.472
She's dying.

53:19.408 --> 53:24.329
Help! Anyone, please help!

53:46.727 --> 53:47.811
Sam.

53:49.229 --> 53:53.483
Sam, wake up. Sam, come on, please. Sam!

54:08.624 --> 54:09.833
She's in there!

55:38.922 --> 55:40.174
Yeah!

55:49.808 --> 55:51.393
What were you doing in the park?

55:52.978 --> 55:54.563
I don't know. I wasn't--

55:54.563 --> 56:00.611
I was waiting for the bus,
and I heard a noise.

56:00.611 --> 56:02.529
I just thought it was an animal at first.

56:02.529 --> 56:05.282
But then when I walked into the park,

56:07.326 --> 56:09.411
Yeah, that's when I saw her.

56:09.995 --> 56:12.247
- You didn't see anyone else in the area?
- No.

56:12.247 --> 56:14.291
- It was just really dark--
- Detective Parsa?

56:14.917 --> 56:18.629
McFadden, Manhattan North.
Looks like we caught a fresh one.

56:19.505 --> 56:20.506
What do you got there?

56:21.131 --> 56:22.633
This was on the girl.

56:22.633 --> 56:25.135
That's mine.

56:25.761 --> 56:28.305
Well then, I suppose this is yours too?
