03:28.509 --> 03:30.276
Are you going out
with him?

No... Well...

We haven't gone
on a real date
or anything.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.083

03:37.117 --> 03:38.418

out the other day,

03:38.451 --> 03:39.753
and he was
kinda depressed,

03:39.786 --> 03:41.121
and we kissed.

It's not...
It's no big deal.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.193

You have a boyfriend.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.995
Yeah, but Tommy
goes to church!

Nick is a freak!

03:52.232 --> 03:53.466
So this...

03:53.499 --> 03:55.468

freak girls.

03:55.502 --> 03:57.037

Patty Filker?

04:06.513 --> 04:09.616
She's a freak girl.
And she has a baby!

no big deal either.

04:12.118 --> 04:15.922
Millie, mind your
own business, OK?

04:17.758 --> 04:20.126

to be late for bio.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.728
Why? What is
the big deal?

04:21.762 --> 04:24.397

late, and everyone
looked at me.

something wrong?

04:42.949 --> 04:45.586
No. Just checkin' in
with my good friend
Lindsay Weir.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.187
Anything wrong with that?

04:47.220 --> 04:48.421
I guess not.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.056
So how's
everything going?

04:50.090 --> 04:51.858

you interested?

04:51.892 --> 04:53.259
Yeah, sure.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.530
Hey, have you checked
out the new Rush album?

04:56.563 --> 04:58.832
I've gotta say
it rocks pretty heavily,

04:58.865 --> 05:02.102
and that's comin'
from a guy who's
seen Hendrix live.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.104
Yeah, I... I heard
it's pretty good.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.405
So...

05:07.440 --> 05:09.943
I understand that you
and Nick Andapolous

05:09.976 --> 05:11.244
are gettin' pretty tight.

are just friends.

Hey, no need to explain
anything to me.

05:18.018 --> 05:21.788
I got it on in a van
at Woodstock, so
I'm not judgin' anybody.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.991
I just want you to know
what you're getting
yourself into.

05:25.025 --> 05:28.194
I mean, when you're
a teenager, your emotions
are running high.

05:28.228 --> 05:30.664
And it's easy
to get confused.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.934
I want you...
To have this.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.272
Oh, my God!

05:39.305 --> 05:42.175
Come on! Don't let
the pamphlet freak you out.

05:42.208 --> 05:44.044
There's some good stuff
in there.

05:44.077 --> 05:47.013
I... It's just that you've
got to be careful these days.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.315
Yeah, I know. I know.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.917
Do you?

05:50.951 --> 05:52.352
I thought I knew, too.

05:52.385 --> 05:55.388
Until one night,
I was checkin' out
this discotheque.

05:55.421 --> 05:57.791
The one at the bowling alley
on 15 Mile.

05:57.824 --> 06:00.661
I met this girl.
She seemed really nice.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.996
We danced a bit.
I kissed her.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.398

led to another and...

06:05.431 --> 06:07.601
Now I get sores on my lip
once a month.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.938

06:13.640 --> 06:15.241
It doesn't hurt that much,
but believe me,

06:15.275 --> 06:16.610
you don't want it!

06:18.211 --> 06:19.713
Can I please go now?

06:20.847 --> 06:22.583
I just blew your mind,
didn't I?

06:23.483 --> 06:26.753
No! Uh‐uh.
No, I just, um...

06:26.787 --> 06:28.454
I don't want to
be late for lunch.

06:28.488 --> 06:31.057
OK, OK, just use
your head, Lindsay.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.158
That's all I ask.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.060
You got it.

06:46.873 --> 06:50.410
Man! Gordon reeks!

06:50.443 --> 06:52.345
You think he
ever takes a shower?

06:52.378 --> 06:54.615
SAM: Maybe he
takes baths instead.

06:54.648 --> 06:57.250
My mom says that they
don't really get you clean.

06:57.283 --> 06:59.185

in your own filth.

11:09.570 --> 11:11.137
Um, yeah.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.706
Yeah? Cool!

11:12.739 --> 11:14.741
Well, have you seen
<i>The Elephant Man?</i>

11:16.076 --> 11:17.110
Hmm?

11:17.143 --> 11:18.144
The movie.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.347
Oh, ohh! The...

11:21.381 --> 11:22.516
Guy with...
The deformed guy.

11:22.549 --> 11:23.584
Yeah.

11:23.617 --> 11:24.718
No, uh‐uh, why?

11:24.751 --> 11:25.852
Well, I was thinking

11:25.886 --> 11:27.087
maybe we could
go see it.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.789
Come on, people,
the bell has rung.

11:28.822 --> 11:31.157
Quit your dilly‐dallying
and get to class!

come on, let's go!

11:33.827 --> 11:35.195
Yes, ma'am...
I mean, sir.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.997
(LAUGHTER)

11:37.030 --> 11:38.732
I was actually...
Ohh...

11:38.765 --> 11:40.266
I was actually thinking,
um...

11:40.300 --> 11:42.235
We could hang out
at my house Friday night.

11:42.268 --> 11:45.205
My parents are going out
and my brothers aren't
going to be around.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.640
And so, I thought, um...

11:46.673 --> 11:48.008
I thought we could just
hang out or something...

11:48.041 --> 11:51.444
Come on! Come on,
get the lead out.
Let's go!

11:51.477 --> 11:52.679
So Friday night
at my house?

11:52.713 --> 11:54.548
Uhh...
Hey!

11:54.581 --> 11:55.616
Yeah.

11:57.083 --> 11:59.986
Come on.
Last one in class,
first one on welfare.

12:00.554 --> 12:01.755
It's your choice.

12:16.603 --> 12:18.471
I like your room, Sam.

12:18.505 --> 12:19.940
Oh, thanks.

OK, let's see here.

12:30.884 --> 12:33.620
I already started on
the plant cell diagram.

12:33.654 --> 12:35.756
It's the animal stuff
that's tricky.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.591
Yeah, I know. I couldn't
tell what was going on

12:37.624 --> 12:39.359
under that microscope.

12:39.392 --> 12:40.927
Could I borrow
your pencil?

12:40.961 --> 12:43.263
Oh, yeah. OK, yeah, sure.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.432
There you go.

13:01.648 --> 13:02.849
Here you go. Thanks.

13:03.617 --> 13:04.918
Thanks.

13:08.388 --> 13:09.856
What's the matter, Sam?

13:10.524 --> 13:12.258
Oh, nothing! Nothing.

13:13.159 --> 13:15.328
I know
what's bugging you.

13:15.361 --> 13:18.031
You didn't want to be
lab partners with me.

13:18.064 --> 13:19.065
Well...

13:19.099 --> 13:21.835
You wanted to be
with Cindy Sanders.

13:21.868 --> 13:24.838
Yeah... Yeah!
How did you know?

13:24.871 --> 13:26.573
It's obvious
you like her.

13:26.607 --> 13:27.808
It is?

13:28.809 --> 13:31.111
Hey, do you think
she likes me?

13:31.144 --> 13:34.414
I don't know.

hard to read that way.

13:36.382 --> 13:37.283
Uh...

make a good couple,

13:39.319 --> 13:41.555
and she's popular
and everything,

13:41.588 --> 13:43.990
but she needs
someone like you.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.291
You'd be good for her.

and memorize it.

into her and say hi.

you run into her,

say, "Hey, did you
change your hair?"

Pretty soon,
you'll have tons of
stuff to talk about.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.264

A, you'll get
to see her more.

B, you'll get to
find out more
about her interests,

16:12.606 --> 16:14.074
and pretend they're
your interests, too.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.475
That makes sense.

16:15.876 --> 16:17.077
And C...

16:17.511 --> 16:19.279
Very important.

16:19.312 --> 16:22.348
You can make sure
she's not falling in
love with anyone else,

16:23.016 --> 16:24.484

Being lab partners

16:29.556 --> 16:32.025

though?

she likes Miss Piggy.

on the chair,

Well, some chairs

always squeak.

17:55.676 --> 17:56.943
It wasn't a squeak.

You know what?
I think you're
making all of this up.

18:03.016 --> 18:06.019
because you want me
to stop liking her,

18:06.052 --> 18:07.588
because you like her now.

really flat today.

not a race.

19:14.454 --> 19:15.556
Millie?

19:16.322 --> 19:17.891

19:18.825 --> 19:19.960
Why?

19:19.993 --> 19:21.227
I just do.

19:23.564 --> 19:24.565
Yes?

19:26.667 --> 19:29.636
Remember when we used
to love Leif Garrett?

19:29.670 --> 19:31.905
And we used to take my
Dynamite magazines out

19:31.938 --> 19:33.273
and kiss his picture?

19:33.874 --> 19:35.208
Yeah.

19:35.241 --> 19:37.277
And we went to see him
at the state fair

19:37.310 --> 19:39.580
and cut all the way
to the front row.

19:39.613 --> 19:42.749
It turned out to be
Jack Albertson from
<i>Chico and the Man.</i>

19:43.183 --> 19:44.551
Oh, yeah.

19:45.251 --> 19:47.120
That kinda sucked.

19:47.153 --> 19:48.755
It wasn't so bad.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.657
It was kinda funny.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.160
Millie, I'm just
saying that

19:54.194 --> 19:56.162
we always dreamed
of having a boyfriend,

19:56.196 --> 19:58.965
and I think I finally
have a boyfriend,

19:58.999 --> 20:00.901
and I think
he wants to have sex.

You can't have sex
with Nick.

never be the same again.

want to marry you.

buy the cow

the milk for free?

21:58.118 --> 21:59.886
why don't you
pair up with Cindy?

22:00.120 --> 22:01.287
Sure.

22:01.321 --> 22:03.657
Mr. Stoker,
you pair up with Carl.

22:03.690 --> 22:06.326
Can you believe we have
to sell yearbook ads?

22:06.359 --> 22:09.029
Yeah. That really sucks.

22:17.470 --> 22:18.972
MRS. WEIR: Hey, Lindsay.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.974
I got something
to show you.

22:23.076 --> 22:24.077
What?

22:25.011 --> 22:26.179
What's up?

22:26.212 --> 22:28.381
Somebody likes you,
that's what's up.

22:29.449 --> 22:31.652
I didn't know
you had a boyfriend.

22:31.685 --> 22:32.786
What's his name?
What's he like?

22:32.819 --> 22:34.487
I want to know
everything, really.

22:34.521 --> 22:37.157
(LAUGHS)
He's just a friend.

22:37.190 --> 22:39.425
A friend?
Do I know him?

22:40.293 --> 22:41.962
Well, open the card.

22:41.995 --> 22:43.530
Mama!
What? What?

22:44.264 --> 22:45.465
Sweetie?

22:58.078 --> 23:00.413
"W‐A‐T‐E."

23:02.849 --> 23:04.084
(LAUGHS)

23:13.527 --> 23:15.529
My dad's store
is right down
the block.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.531
Yeah?
All right, great.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.165
(SIGHS)

23:20.701 --> 23:23.336
You know, I really
liked what you wrote
for the yearbook.

23:23.369 --> 23:24.771
It was really cool.

23:24.805 --> 23:27.440
I think Mr. Mainzer
doesn't know what
he's talking about.

23:28.308 --> 23:29.576
Thanks.

23:30.844 --> 23:32.412
And you know,
you're right.

23:32.445 --> 23:34.047
Being a freshman stinks.

23:34.648 --> 23:36.282
I know, it's like...

23:36.316 --> 23:38.451
Everyone pigeonholes
you and expects you

23:38.484 --> 23:40.386
to act a certain way.

23:40.420 --> 23:41.888
It's like if
you're a cheerleader,

23:41.922 --> 23:44.157
you're supposed to be
in a good mood all the time.

23:44.190 --> 23:45.626
Yeah, that
must be tough.

23:45.659 --> 23:47.293
I know! It's like
there are some days

23:47.327 --> 23:49.563
when I'm just feeling
a little bit cranky.

23:49.963 --> 23:50.964
Like today.

23:50.997 --> 23:53.934
I just got my period.
So what? Deal with it.

23:56.970 --> 23:58.171
All right,
thanks, Mike.

23:58.204 --> 24:00.140
And good luck
with that bomb shelter.

24:00.173 --> 24:01.508
(BELL ON DOOR RINGS)

24:02.375 --> 24:03.644
MR. WEIR: Sam?

24:03.677 --> 24:05.679
I thought you were going
to help me out today.

24:05.712 --> 24:07.948
Oh, yeah, I was
at a yearbook meeting.

24:07.981 --> 24:09.516
(BELL RINGS)

24:09.550 --> 24:11.051
yearbook? when the heck
did you join that?

24:11.084 --> 24:12.118
Uh, today.

24:12.152 --> 24:13.587
This is
my friend Cindy.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.155
Hi. Nice to meet you.

24:15.188 --> 24:18.424
Hello.
Uh, look, Sam.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.561
Now, look, you gotta
put in your time.

24:20.594 --> 24:22.228
I'm trying to teach
you a work ethic here.

24:22.262 --> 24:25.265
Now, if you want
to buy those crazy
micronaut things,

24:25.298 --> 24:27.267
you're going to have
to earn the money.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.002
Oh, for cryin' out loud,

24:29.035 --> 24:31.471
who mixed up the balls?

24:31.505 --> 24:34.941
Um, you have
a really nice store,
Mr. Weir.

24:34.975 --> 24:37.611
Dave, bring up
those boxes up there.

24:38.278 --> 24:41.281
Uh, Dad, Cindy and I...

24:41.314 --> 24:43.850
Well, we're
selling yearbook ads.

24:43.884 --> 24:48.855
And 1/8 of a page is $25.
Do you want to buy one?

24:48.889 --> 24:50.423
1/8 for $25?

24:50.456 --> 24:51.725
Sam, that's
highway robbery!

24:51.758 --> 24:54.260
I can get a full
page in a Sunday
paper for a hundred.

24:54.294 --> 24:55.896
But this is
really important

24:55.929 --> 24:58.331
that Cindy and I
sell these.

24:58.364 --> 24:59.700
(BELL ON DOOR CHIMES)

25:01.868 --> 25:04.505
Oh, well,
tell you what.

25:04.538 --> 25:06.072
Give me a full page.

25:07.273 --> 25:08.842
Wow! thank you,
Mr. Weir.

25:08.875 --> 25:11.512
No problem.
Sam is my best
salesman, you know?

25:11.545 --> 25:12.746
Really?

25:13.814 --> 25:16.016
OK, so we've got
16 more ads to sell,

25:16.049 --> 25:17.784
and I think we should go
to the big stores first

25:17.818 --> 25:19.085
since they'll probably
buy more space.

25:19.119 --> 25:21.421
Yeah, but
the small stores
close earlier, so...

25:21.454 --> 25:24.525
Oh, wait a minute now.
you're squandering
your manpower.

25:24.558 --> 25:25.926
What you gotta do
is split up,

25:25.959 --> 25:27.894
and, you know,
take separate routes.

25:27.928 --> 25:29.763
That way you can
cover more ground.

25:30.531 --> 25:31.865
CINDY: Thank you.

25:33.534 --> 25:35.501
But then again,

25:35.536 --> 25:38.471
some of the greatest
salesmen worked in teams.

25:38.505 --> 25:40.741
Yeah, maybe we should
stick together.

25:40.774 --> 25:42.609
Yeah, but we'll both
finish sooner if we split up,

25:42.643 --> 25:43.877
Don't you think?

25:47.113 --> 25:48.582
Yeah, I guess so.

25:49.382 --> 25:51.017
Thank you, Mr. Weir.

25:52.418 --> 25:53.720
See ya, Dad.

25:57.457 --> 25:58.959
Sir, don't open that bait.

26:00.260 --> 26:03.496
So I saw Sam's
yearbook partner
at the store today.

26:03.530 --> 26:05.131
Quite a cute
little number.

26:05.165 --> 26:07.367
Hmm.
God, Dad!

26:07.400 --> 26:09.636
What? What's
wrong with that?

26:09.670 --> 26:10.937
She's cute.

26:10.971 --> 26:12.806
Am I supposed
to call her "Ms."
or something?

26:12.839 --> 26:16.442
See, Lindsay,
Sam's not afraid to
show off his girlfriend.

26:16.476 --> 26:17.678
Mom!

26:20.380 --> 26:22.348
What's eating you?
Ah, just...

26:23.617 --> 26:25.118
Lindsay has a boyfriend.

26:25.552 --> 26:26.587
Oh, my God!

26:26.620 --> 26:27.988
What? Who?

26:28.021 --> 26:29.723
(LAUGHS)

26:29.756 --> 26:32.526
Someone sent her
a red rose.

26:32.559 --> 26:34.728
He must be
some kind of Romeo.

26:34.761 --> 26:35.962
Yeah, I'll say he is.

26:35.996 --> 26:37.531
Who the hell
is this joker?

26:37.564 --> 26:39.232
He's just a friend.

26:39.265 --> 26:42.468
Nobody who's
"just a friend"
sends a single rose.

26:42.503 --> 26:44.605
I know all about
single roses.

26:44.638 --> 26:45.706
I sent one
to your mother,

26:45.739 --> 26:47.574
and I know when
and why I sent it.

26:47.608 --> 26:48.909
MRS. WEIR: Harold.

26:48.942 --> 26:51.177
Lindsay, you can
tell us who it is,

26:51.211 --> 26:54.080
and we won't make
a big deal out of it,
all right?

26:54.515 --> 26:55.749
LINDSAY: OK.

26:56.316 --> 26:57.618
OK, it's Nick.

26:58.118 --> 26:59.520
Nick?
Nick?

26:59.553 --> 27:01.788
It's not another one
of those burn‐outs.

27:01.822 --> 27:02.956
No!

27:02.989 --> 27:06.059
Nick? Was he the one that
ate all my fruit roll‐ups?

27:06.092 --> 27:07.661
Well, you said
he could have them.

27:07.694 --> 27:09.630
No, I... I know. I...

27:09.663 --> 27:11.264
Well, you'd better
know right now

27:11.297 --> 27:13.534
that your mother
and I are not
taking care of

27:13.567 --> 27:15.035
some "wedlock" baby,

27:15.068 --> 27:16.970
while you're off
gallivanting at college.

27:17.203 --> 27:18.238
Dad!

27:18.271 --> 27:19.305
I'm warning you, Lindsay.

27:19.339 --> 27:22.308
I absolutely forbid you
from seeing this boy.

27:32.719 --> 27:34.287
Well, at least
she didn't yell.

27:35.455 --> 27:36.690
Honey.

27:44.497 --> 27:47.100
See, you don't know
what it's like

27:47.133 --> 27:49.603
to have a daughter
and want to protect her.

27:49.636 --> 27:52.105
Well, I mean,
you will someday.

27:52.138 --> 27:55.175
We'd like that day
to be a long time
from now.

27:55.208 --> 27:59.079
We just want to be sure
that this boy respects
you, honey.

27:59.112 --> 28:00.413
Not all of them do.

28:00.446 --> 28:02.248
Trust me. I know
what they're like.

28:02.282 --> 28:03.483
I was one of them.

28:03.517 --> 28:05.218
Ugh! he was.

28:06.019 --> 28:08.421
I know. You find it
hard to believe,

28:08.454 --> 28:11.592
but I did
some stupid things
when I was young.

28:11.625 --> 28:12.826
Honey.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.029
Tell her about Korea.

28:17.063 --> 28:18.198
Ko...

28:19.265 --> 28:20.333

28:22.335 --> 28:24.838
Well, one day...

28:25.939 --> 28:29.309
I, uh, went into Seoul
on a weekend pass

28:30.243 --> 28:32.746
and went to this bar.

28:33.780 --> 28:36.349
And I had
a few too many.

28:36.382 --> 28:37.383
And...

28:38.785 --> 28:42.122
I followed a couple
of my buddies to the...

28:43.724 --> 28:44.958
Red‐light district.

28:44.991 --> 28:47.460
Your father's first time
wasn't special,

28:48.428 --> 28:50.697
and he's always
regretted it.

28:50.731 --> 28:53.299
It was the worst
$5.00 I've ever spent.

28:55.068 --> 28:58.839
And I wish I could get
that $5.00 back.

28:58.872 --> 29:01.908
Ohh, come on! please stop!

29:01.942 --> 29:05.011
W... What your father
is trying to say is...

29:06.012 --> 29:08.314
That your virginity is...

29:08.348 --> 29:09.750
A gift.

29:43.817 --> 29:44.951
Let's get out of here.

29:44.985 --> 29:46.853
Hold on a second.
I gotta find my smokes.

29:46.887 --> 29:48.188
Did you take 'em?

29:48.221 --> 29:49.255
No.

29:49.289 --> 29:50.824
Hey, man, we're goin'
to Des's tonight.

29:50.857 --> 29:52.092
Are you coming?

29:52.125 --> 29:53.059
No. Oh, hey.

29:53.093 --> 29:55.596
No, actually, I'm
hangin' out with Linds.

29:55.629 --> 29:58.064
Ohh, all right.
Make it happen.

29:58.098 --> 30:01.735
Oh, tonight's
the niiight!

30:01.768 --> 30:03.904
Ooh!
Call me tomorrow, Lindsay.

30:03.937 --> 30:05.338
I want to know
everything that happens.

30:05.371 --> 30:07.340
So do I, Lindsay.

30:07.373 --> 30:10.711
Keep yawnin' like that,
you're gonna dislocate
your jaw.

30:10.744 --> 30:12.979
Guys, wait up.

30:13.013 --> 30:15.582
Hey, Sam.
you know what Cindy
said last night?

30:16.583 --> 30:18.251
What? that she's
in love with you?

30:18.284 --> 30:21.855
That... That she thinks
you're smart and funny

30:21.888 --> 30:24.558
and you don't care
if she cuts the cheese?

30:24.591 --> 30:26.259
You know what, Bill?

30:26.292 --> 30:27.961
Why don't you
just go out with her?

30:27.994 --> 30:30.330
Why don't you
marry her? I don't
care anymore, OK?

30:30.363 --> 30:31.364
I don't care.

30:32.132 --> 30:33.166
God!

30:33.199 --> 30:34.868
I was gonna say

30:34.901 --> 30:36.770
she said
she thought

30:36.803 --> 30:38.404
you were the nicest guy
in the school.

30:39.873 --> 30:41.207
Cindy said that?

30:41.675 --> 30:42.876
Yeah.

30:43.510 --> 30:45.145
No, wait. No, seriously.

30:46.379 --> 30:47.548
You don't like Cindy?

30:48.381 --> 30:50.316
No. Man, I was just
messin' with you.

30:50.350 --> 30:53.053

with Melissa Karpinski

30:53.086 --> 30:55.722
ever since he stood behind
her at the Dairy Queen.

She was wearing
this halter top.

30:58.892 --> 31:01.895
She is
one foxy lady.

cut the cheese.

31:03.396 --> 31:04.264
(BOTH LAUGH)

31:04.297 --> 31:06.132
Come on! Everybody
cuts the cheese.

31:06.166 --> 31:08.569
Anyways
Melissa Karpinski is
way out of your league.

31:08.602 --> 31:11.137
She goes out with,
like, the big
football players.

Ooh.

31:12.072 --> 31:13.574
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

31:14.641 --> 31:15.876
I'm going
to fill out soon.

You know
my cousin Jeff?

31:17.210 --> 31:18.912
He was a shrimp
until he turned 16,

31:18.945 --> 31:20.446
and then he got all
tall and muscular,

31:20.480 --> 31:21.548
like, in a month.

31:21.582 --> 31:23.083
Now he looks
like the Hulk.

You really think
I'll fill out?

31:25.986 --> 31:28.221
Yeah, not like me,
though.

to be enormous.

have you ever seen
a grown man naked?

ask Gordon to come
with us?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

31:58.418 --> 32:00.420
But he's really cool.

32:01.221 --> 32:03.423
Maybe he doesn't
even know he smells.

32:04.991 --> 32:06.527
Are you gonna tell him?

32:10.731 --> 32:11.932
Hey, Gordon.

Hey. Uh, how's it going
with you‐know‐who?
