01:21.164 --> 01:22.154
Yeah?

01:25.502 --> 01:27.619
No, no. No, we're leaving Cannes now.

01:32.676 --> 01:35.544
Hey, Budapest could be huge for us.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.674
They say we'll cut production costs in half!

01:40.017 --> 01:41.849
No, a vacation can wait.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.640
Yeah, Annie knows. She understands.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.860
Right, I met with Mr. Yamamoto this morning.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.865
He finally said yes to our deal.

01:58.035 --> 02:00.903
Yeah. I almost threw my back out bowing.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.030
Okay, later.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.726
You have no idea how good
this tastes after seaweed and fish.

02:28.899 --> 02:31.232
Why can't the Japanese distributors
just serve croissants?

02:31.401 --> 02:34.064
I mean, we're in France, for Christ sakes.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.479
Can I offer you some delicious cold coffee?

02:38.200 --> 02:39.657
Let me see.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.779
I gotta keep packing.

02:47.084 --> 02:48.074
You okay?

02:48.585 --> 02:50.326
I'll be fine, it's just my ears, you know.

02:50.504 --> 02:51.494
Right.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.288
Come on, 100 camels?

02:53.382 --> 02:56.546
Where the hell are we gonna get 100 camels,
for Christ sakes?

02:57.552 --> 02:58.838
What does the script say?

02:59.221 --> 03:02.589
Goats. I thought so.
And those Moroccan goats work cheap.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.098
You tell the director, no more creativity.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.428
He's gonna use the goddamn goats...

03:05.519 --> 03:07.602
And he's lucky he still has a job. Okay?

03:09.731 --> 03:12.098
Have I mentioned
that overseas production is a bitch?

03:16.571 --> 03:20.190
Seriously, 12 euros for a bottle of water.

03:20.283 --> 03:24.027
And look, they charged you for
a hamburger and a cheese sandwich.

03:24.121 --> 03:26.955
Well, I wanted a cheeseburger,
but I couldn't order one...

03:27.249 --> 03:30.788
So, I got both and I made my own.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.207
Honey, what are you working so hard for

03:34.297 --> 03:37.165
if your wife can't have a cheeseburger
when she wants one?

03:37.259 --> 03:38.875
Baby, I'd buy you a billion cheeseburgers,

03:38.969 --> 03:41.632
but you know how much
I hate wasteful extravagance.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.180
Yes. Because your cufflinks
were such a bargain.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.637
Have you seen that book I...

03:48.937 --> 03:49.927
Thank you.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.097
Now let me check those little ears.

03:53.608 --> 03:54.815
So sweet.

03:58.238 --> 04:01.731
Yeah. Okay. I'll be right down.

04:02.284 --> 04:03.946
Honey, would you call the bellman?

04:05.620 --> 04:07.111
Have him come up and get my bags.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.420
<i>We're sorry, all lines are busy.</i>

04:21.678 --> 04:22.668
Excuse me.

04:24.181 --> 04:25.672
Sorry.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.179
<i>Madame,</i> I'm so sorry.

04:29.436 --> 04:32.304
Would you please hold this under Lockwood?

04:35.192 --> 04:36.353
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.025
It was my real dream to act.

04:41.198 --> 04:45.192
And so I went to Paris seven years ago.

04:45.368 --> 04:48.452
And it was a wonderful experience.

04:48.580 --> 04:49.946
It's a pleasure to meet you.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.077
I enjoyed talking to you. Good luck.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.374
Pleasure to meet you, too.

04:54.544 --> 04:55.534
Hi, honey.

04:56.379 --> 04:57.369
<i>Bonjour,</i> Anne.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.206
Hello, Jacques.

05:00.675 --> 05:03.793
You're all set.
I've checked you out and the car is waiting.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.004
- You look lovely.
- She does, doesn't she?

05:06.640 --> 05:08.051
Come on.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.553
Mr. Lockwood, can I have a photo?

05:17.526 --> 05:18.607
Thank you.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.184
Your driver is here.

05:42.259 --> 05:43.591
I read the script.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.417
Yes?

05:45.595 --> 05:48.963
And I'm telling you, it could be a little
classic, and it's commercial, too.

05:49.391 --> 05:52.805
Classic and commercial?
Come on. Let's go produce it!

05:55.021 --> 05:56.182
Only for a minute.

05:57.732 --> 05:59.064
What's the matter?

06:04.364 --> 06:05.480
What the hell?

06:08.285 --> 06:12.450
Michael, you know I am not a whiner,
but my ears...

06:12.622 --> 06:15.786
Baby, I'm sorry. You'll be able
to rest when we get to Budapest.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.450
And wait till you see where we're staying.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.540
It's Mario. What's my inseam?

06:23.717 --> 06:26.630
34 inches. 86 centimeters.

06:31.308 --> 06:35.097
The food on the plane will not be food.
So I got you something good.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.650
Try this sausage.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.812
The old man in that shop makes it himself.

06:54.497 --> 06:55.988
And look at this Dijon mustard.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.492
It's Edmond Fallot. The best in France!

07:01.129 --> 07:03.166
Anne, here are some drops for your ears.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.003
Thank you, Jacques.

07:09.346 --> 07:12.339
Our director in Morocco
has gone completely crazy.

07:12.641 --> 07:14.132
He's into double overtime every day.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.926
He seduced his leading lady
but now they're fighting on the set.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.683
It's a nightmare.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.607
Yes, but he's had three straight hits.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.519
Relax, we can trust him.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.031
What's he doing now?

07:31.534 --> 07:32.524
I don't know.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.888
Smell that perfume!

07:59.396 --> 08:00.603
And it's full of vitamins!

08:28.049 --> 08:29.256
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.639
I can't believe Laszlo sent this.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.592
I told you he wants to be
in business with us.

08:39.727 --> 08:42.436
Be careful, because he's not a generous man.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.023
Yes?

08:47.110 --> 08:50.194
- I notice your ears seem to be bothering you.
- Well, yes.

08:50.447 --> 08:53.155
I must warn you that the cabin pressure
can be quite painful.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.570
I don't recommend you fly today.

08:55.660 --> 08:56.650
Thank you.

09:00.123 --> 09:04.493
Michael, I think I should skip Budapest
and just go straight to Paris.

09:05.795 --> 09:06.785
What?

09:07.088 --> 09:08.078
Yeah.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.839
I mean, you're gonna be
working the whole time anyway.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.880
Well, honey, I'm just sorry I didn't know
you were feeling so bad.

09:14.304 --> 09:15.465
May I make a suggestion?

09:15.764 --> 09:16.971
I'll take care of her.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.638
- Really?
- Yes.

09:18.808 --> 09:22.347
I have meetings tomorrow morning in Paris
and I'm driving back now.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.437
That's fine. I can take the train, it's fine.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.856
Everybody's leaving Cannes today.
The trains are full.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.934
So, let me drive you.

09:30.653 --> 09:33.145
That's very generous,
but you sure it's okay with you?

09:34.240 --> 09:35.856
You'll be there by dinner time.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.150
Look, I don't bite.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.237
You rest up in Paris. I'll call you tonight.

09:41.331 --> 09:42.742
Baby, I love you.

09:43.458 --> 09:44.574
Hold on one second please.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.124
I gotta go. Bye.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.165
Michael!

10:03.353 --> 10:04.469
This is a lovely car.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.849
Yes. She's with me for a long time.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.896
No, no, no, no. You need lunch. Come.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.018
Here.

10:16.366 --> 10:20.531
I like to stay here when I'm in Cannes,
away from the crowd at the beach.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.828
It's a beautiful day.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.699
Are you nervous?

10:27.544 --> 10:29.410
Maybe. A little bit.

10:31.214 --> 10:33.831
We've never actually been alone together.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.754
So you didn't believe me
when I said I don't bite.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.225
Would you like a glass of wine?

10:46.938 --> 10:47.928
No, no.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.347
No, no. Thank you.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.141
Yes!

10:53.069 --> 10:54.310
When in France.

10:59.826 --> 11:02.318
You'll like this wine,
it's Châteauneuf-du-Pape.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.908
That's good!

11:20.430 --> 11:23.798
This wine goes well with
your ham <i>de</i> Bayonne and melon.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.723
It's delicious!

11:34.527 --> 11:37.520
I know it's rude, but, Anne,
I may have to take some calls.

11:38.448 --> 11:41.191
It's okay. I'm used to it.

11:42.535 --> 11:43.651
You shouldn't be.

11:47.081 --> 11:50.620
Anne, a deal offer is like a soufflé.
It's all about timing.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.789
Yes, you don't want it to collapse.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.079
Yes?

11:57.967 --> 12:02.462
No, tell him I'm not in unless
the UK comes in for 30%.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.927
Well, then, tell him to go to hell!

12:09.562 --> 12:10.552
Okay?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.350
Excuse me a minute.

12:52.689 --> 12:55.523
Anne, I need a credit card. Do you have one?

12:56.150 --> 12:58.437
- Don't you have a credit card?
- I have many.

12:58.528 --> 12:59.939
I explain later.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.019
Okay.

13:04.659 --> 13:07.117
Just to hold the hotel reservation
until we get there.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.193
Did you say hotel?

13:08.538 --> 13:09.528
Yes.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.447
Jacques, we're going to Paris.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.616
Of course, of course, but you need rest.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.660
There is a fine inn
with an excellent restaurant.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.582
And it's truffle season!

13:28.391 --> 13:29.552
It doesn't work?

13:29.642 --> 13:31.759
I need to open the door for you.

13:34.397 --> 13:35.854
Yeah.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.309
So how are your ears?

13:40.486 --> 13:43.274
I hope those drops will help. Thank you.

13:45.867 --> 13:48.109
Mozart, we couldn't do better.

13:51.831 --> 13:56.246
So let's pretend we don't know where
we're going or even who we are.

13:56.753 --> 13:57.743
Brother.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.922
You see that mountain over there?

14:11.351 --> 14:13.593
- Yeah.
- It's St. Victoire.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.430
Do you see that truck right in front of us!

14:19.609 --> 14:21.601
It's a major landmark of this region,

14:21.778 --> 14:25.692
and a favorite subject
for many writers and artists.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.407
Cézanne captured it perfectly.

14:29.077 --> 14:33.321
I saw a beautiful exhibition of his work
last year in Aix-en-Provence.

14:34.624 --> 14:36.160
- That's great.
- Yeah.

14:36.542 --> 14:40.286
It must have been incredible to see
Cézanne's paintings here in this light.

14:40.797 --> 14:41.787
Yeah.

14:43.132 --> 14:46.296
The ones that I know at the Met in New York,
they look a little sad.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.385
You know, as if they
don't really want to be there.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.823
I like to stop about every hour.

15:14.497 --> 15:17.240
Stretch my legs and have a cigarette.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.754
It's been 42 minutes.

15:29.720 --> 15:30.927
Yeah.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.188
She gets thirsty.

15:44.861 --> 15:47.604
I hope my smoking isn't bothering you.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.857
Actually it reminds me of my father.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.531
He smoked two packs
of Camel cigarettes a day.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.362
He died at 56.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.992
See that hilltop over there?

16:02.670 --> 16:06.380
See those old stone walls and that castle?

16:06.466 --> 16:09.129
The Romans were all through this area.

16:11.679 --> 16:14.046
Did you know that this
region is called Provence

16:14.223 --> 16:16.886
because it was a province of Rome?

16:17.393 --> 16:18.554
- No.
- Yes.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.895
Michael and I have flown
from the south of France to Paris,

16:22.064 --> 16:23.475
but we've never driven.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.559
Driving is the only way to see a country.

16:29.906 --> 16:32.523
I've always wanted to see
the lavender in bloom.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.364
It's gorgeous!

16:37.413 --> 16:39.245
I'll show you something.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.246
Anne, you know, I'm happy to be here with you

16:47.340 --> 16:50.333
because it's the first time
I've come back here since I was a kid.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.714
Oh, my God!

16:54.931 --> 16:57.093
- Yeah.
- It's incredible.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.637
It's part of an aqueduct
built when the Romans

16:59.727 --> 17:02.845
were at the height of their power,
just to impress their subjects.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.601
Well, I'm impressed.

17:06.067 --> 17:07.808
- Two-thousand years ago?
- Yeah.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.781
They were great stonemasons.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.464
People canoe on this river.

17:36.472 --> 17:38.634
- That sounds fun.
- Yeah.

17:39.809 --> 17:43.769
I can't remember the last time Michael
and I played hooky for the afternoon.

17:45.481 --> 17:48.895
You've got to taste the
<i>noisette, nocciola</i>. It's great.

17:49.527 --> 17:52.611
And you must try the <i>cassis.</i>
And <i>fraise des bois.</i>

18:05.585 --> 18:06.917
That's pretty good.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.425
Look, wild lupine.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.548
We have wild lupine in California.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.217
Yes, but you can't eat them.

18:20.516 --> 18:21.506
Well, no.

18:23.227 --> 18:25.310
Look at the wild dandelions.

18:31.527 --> 18:34.770
With a little olive oil,
crushed anchovies, salt and pepper...

18:34.864 --> 18:38.653
They make a marvelous salad.
I'm sure the Romans ate them.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.660
Does everything remind you of eating?

18:42.455 --> 18:43.445
Yes.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.708
Stay, please. The light is perfect.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.040
- Yeah?
- Turn a little.

18:54.508 --> 18:56.545
Yes. Now come in close.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.377
It's great.

18:59.347 --> 19:00.337
Yeah.

20:03.035 --> 20:07.245
This is Erik Satie.
He was a very eccentric man.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.618
Did you know he never washed his shirts?

20:11.085 --> 20:12.542
So, his wife did them?

20:12.628 --> 20:14.244
No, he did not have a wife.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.328
No?

20:15.464 --> 20:18.298
No, not everyone
has to have a wife to be happy.

20:19.135 --> 20:22.173
So, when his shirts got dirty,
he just threw them away.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.350
- Jacques.
- Yeah?

21:12.188 --> 21:13.269
I'm not French.

21:13.397 --> 21:15.855
Yes, that is correct. Please.

21:25.701 --> 21:29.035
Our dinner reservation is in 45 minutes.
Can you be ready?

21:29.205 --> 21:31.197
- I'll meet you downstairs.
- Okay.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.305
Hi!

21:58.067 --> 21:59.729
<i>I was thinking about you.</i>

22:00.694 --> 22:02.230
Yeah, what were you thinking?

22:03.239 --> 22:04.980
<i>About your sweet little ears.</i>

22:05.574 --> 22:06.906
<i>So how's Paris?</i>

22:07.076 --> 22:08.567
I'm actually not there yet.

22:08.911 --> 22:10.618
<i>Why, what happened?</i>

22:11.372 --> 22:14.331
Nothing, really.
Jacques wanted to stop for the night.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.532
<i>He what?</i>

22:17.336 --> 22:19.828
Look, he's not the greatest driver.

22:20.256 --> 22:22.839
It's probably a good thing
we're not on the roads after dark.

22:22.925 --> 22:27.010
<i>Yeah. Hey, don't forget, he's a Frenchman.</i>

22:27.805 --> 22:28.966
How's Budapest?

22:29.056 --> 22:32.891
<i>The hotel is great.
It has an amazing view of the Danube.</i>

22:32.977 --> 22:34.934
- <i>How are you feeling?</i>
- Better.

22:35.271 --> 22:37.012
Those ear drops are really helping.

22:37.439 --> 22:38.725
<i>What ear drops?</i>

22:42.069 --> 22:46.313
Michael, let's go on a real vacation,
just the two of us.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.274
<i>Yeah, my phone not invited.</i>

22:50.286 --> 22:52.073
<i>Honey, I think I'm getting
my back thing again.</i>

22:52.246 --> 22:53.612
<i>Do you know where my pill pack is?</i>

22:55.791 --> 22:58.204
- It's in the pocket of your kit.
- <i>I looked there.</i>

22:59.962 --> 23:02.750
- It's on the inside zip one.
- <i>Okay, thanks.</i>

23:03.299 --> 23:04.665
<i>You're the best.</i>

23:04.758 --> 23:07.000
<i>What time do you think
you'll get to Paris tomorrow?</i>

23:08.304 --> 23:10.216
Early afternoon, I guess.

23:10.306 --> 23:13.014
<i>Okay. Call me when you get there. Love you.</i>

23:13.142 --> 23:14.633
All right. Love you, too.

23:39.335 --> 23:40.746
I'm sorry, I don't speak French.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.087
I'm sorry. What did he say?

23:48.427 --> 23:51.010
He said, "You're very lucky
to be having dinner with Jacques."

23:53.766 --> 23:56.349
The chef here was famous for roast baby lamb.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.598
What looks good to you, Anne?

24:02.483 --> 24:05.066
Everything looks good. I can't decide.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.105
You don't have to.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.881
I'm full already.

24:50.030 --> 24:52.647
The wines of the region
are Condrieu and Côte-Rôtie.

24:52.741 --> 24:54.107
We'll have them both.

25:10.134 --> 25:11.295
This looks great!

25:15.723 --> 25:18.682
So, Michael tells me
you've closed your dress shop.

25:18.767 --> 25:21.760
Yes. My partner moved to London
with her husband.

25:22.104 --> 25:24.096
- I couldn't keep it open by myself.
- Do you miss it?

25:24.440 --> 25:27.103
I miss our customers
and all the pretty clothes.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.483
But I'm ready to try something new.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.356
What interests you now?

25:31.447 --> 25:33.109
I notice you take a lot of pictures.

25:33.198 --> 25:34.439
Those are just for fun.

25:35.451 --> 25:38.034
I started taking photos
for our shop announcements.

25:39.455 --> 25:41.117
And now I can't stop.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.243
Now.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.459
Another one.

26:07.316 --> 26:11.356
I did this with our daughter,
Alexandra, when she was little.

26:11.653 --> 26:14.646
I remember her.
She liked to wear your red shoes.

26:14.948 --> 26:17.065
- You remember that?
- Yeah.

26:17.493 --> 26:19.109
I still have those shoes.

26:20.621 --> 26:22.829
So when was the last time you wore them?

26:23.999 --> 26:25.160
How old is she now?

26:26.585 --> 26:27.792
She's 18.

26:29.129 --> 26:31.462
Here's a picture
of her high school graduation.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.257
She's at U.C. Santa Barbara, now.

26:35.344 --> 26:37.381
It's her second semester away from home.

26:38.472 --> 26:39.462
She has lovely eyes...

26:40.933 --> 26:42.014
Like her mother.

26:42.684 --> 26:45.927
Her mother is so used to juggling work
and taking care of her...

26:46.105 --> 26:48.142
I don't know what I'm gonna do with myself.

26:48.524 --> 26:49.935
But you have so much to offer.

26:50.025 --> 26:51.687
It's a great time for you now.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.569
- It is?
- Yes, of course.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.238
What makes you dance in the street?

26:58.534 --> 27:00.901
You're beautiful.
You're an interesting woman.

27:01.203 --> 27:02.319
Come on.

27:02.412 --> 27:05.530
I saw all the men in Cannes
drooling over those young girls.

27:05.791 --> 27:06.998
Come on. They're just Pop-Tarts.

27:07.084 --> 27:10.327
You, you're chocolate crème brûlée.

27:10.420 --> 27:12.878
Yes, that's you. Brûlée.

27:19.721 --> 27:22.088
Let me introduce you to Anne.

27:22.182 --> 27:23.593
- This is Carole.
- Nice to meet you.

27:23.684 --> 27:24.640
- Nice to meet you.
- Sorry for intruding.

27:24.726 --> 27:26.388
I just heard that Jacques was here.

27:38.574 --> 27:40.736
- Enjoy your dinner.
- Thank you.

27:47.749 --> 27:49.741
I used to come here. I got to know Carole.

27:50.586 --> 27:51.918
Yeah, that was clear.

27:52.546 --> 27:53.582
She's the owner's niece.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.163
Of course.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.214
Why do flowers smell so much better in France

28:00.304 --> 28:01.420
than they do in the US?

28:01.555 --> 28:03.091
Why? Because we're in France.

28:04.183 --> 28:08.223
In America they look lovely
but they smell like a refrigerator.

28:08.770 --> 28:10.261
- It's true.
- Yeah.

28:12.482 --> 28:14.144
Roses are my favorite.

28:14.234 --> 28:17.477
Yes, but their scent mustn't
intrude on the aroma of the wine.

28:29.708 --> 28:33.952
Did you know that it was the Romans
who started winemaking in France?

28:34.796 --> 28:37.334
I did not know that, my tour guide.

28:53.357 --> 28:54.347
You'll see.

29:10.499 --> 29:12.957
So <i>dorade royale</i> is what you call snapper.

29:13.043 --> 29:17.003
It has little teeth like a baby
and it comes from the Atlantic.

29:21.134 --> 29:22.591
That's a pretty dress, Brûlée.

29:22.678 --> 29:24.044
Is it from your store?

29:24.179 --> 29:26.091
Actually, it's French.

29:26.848 --> 29:29.215
Normally I have a passion for textiles.

29:29.309 --> 29:31.551
And what else do you have a passion for?

29:33.522 --> 29:34.854
Very expensive jewelry.

29:36.525 --> 29:39.609
Yeah, like that fancy bracelet
I see you wearing.

29:44.992 --> 29:45.982
That.

29:46.994 --> 29:50.533
Actually this was given to me
by a chef in Barcelona.

29:51.039 --> 29:55.454
We ate the best seafood in the world.
Fresh barnacles, giant crabs.

29:56.211 --> 30:00.000
He wore it to remind himself
of his humble beginnings,

30:00.090 --> 30:03.254
and how extraordinary it is
to be eating like we are.

30:03.677 --> 30:05.043
I never take it off.

30:09.558 --> 30:13.051
Are you trying to get me drunk?
That's naughty.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.724
Just drink what you feel like.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.567
The lamb and the veal are milk fed.

30:21.737 --> 30:24.525
This is the best time of the year
to eat young animals.

30:27.075 --> 30:30.785
Yes, well it's also
the best time to eat young carrots.

30:35.751 --> 30:39.495
So, why have you never married?

30:40.922 --> 30:42.504
I heard you had a girlfriend

30:42.674 --> 30:46.418
and she was a marvelous chef
and she had her own little restaurant.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.468
She sounded perfect for you.

30:51.099 --> 30:55.309
Well, that was a long time ago.

30:59.441 --> 31:01.603
Well, what happened?

31:02.778 --> 31:04.861
We were right for each other, but...

31:07.616 --> 31:10.324
Unfortunately, there were circumstances.

31:12.287 --> 31:13.528
Not all things are meant to be.

31:14.915 --> 31:18.033
Yes, well, love isn't always fair.

31:18.585 --> 31:19.917
Why is that?

31:20.796 --> 31:22.458
It will never make sense to me.

31:32.641 --> 31:34.507
Jacques, I can't eat much more.

31:35.477 --> 31:39.562
<i>This cheese is made from unpasteurized
milk. It's alive and very healthy.</i>

31:40.023 --> 31:42.561
Your cheese in America
is pasteurized. It's dead.

31:42.651 --> 31:44.984
It goes into your stomach like a ball of fat.

31:45.070 --> 31:47.813
Is that why you French people can eat
all the butter and cheese you want

31:47.906 --> 31:49.067
and never gain weight?

31:49.157 --> 31:50.989
Yes, and we drink more red wine.

31:51.076 --> 31:52.487
Of course, we are more romantic.

31:53.161 --> 31:54.572
Is that so?

31:56.623 --> 32:00.162
So, Brûlée, you know my vice, it's smoking.

32:00.335 --> 32:02.076
Now you must confess yours.

32:14.474 --> 32:15.510
Oh, my gosh.

32:18.520 --> 32:21.513
That is the last time
I ever tell you the truth.

32:21.731 --> 32:22.767
Just taste.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.358
Just eat what you feel like.

32:27.320 --> 32:30.529
You know, unlike smoking,

32:31.199 --> 32:33.441
there are studies that say
that chocolate is good for you.

32:34.661 --> 32:37.825
You Americans always have
to have a reason for everything.

32:37.914 --> 32:39.450
We eat what we enjoy.

32:43.503 --> 32:46.166
Michael called me just before
we came down for dinner.

32:47.299 --> 32:50.042
He's worried about us here together.

32:50.886 --> 32:52.218
Are you?

32:54.389 --> 32:55.755
Should I be?

32:55.849 --> 32:57.056
Well, I don't know.

32:57.392 --> 33:00.885
In a long marriage,
after your child leaves home...

33:02.314 --> 33:03.475
Are you happy?

33:06.818 --> 33:09.026
- We have a good marriage...
- No, that's not what I asked you.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.061
Are you happy?

33:12.741 --> 33:13.822
Well, sure.

33:14.534 --> 33:16.025
Sometimes.

33:16.661 --> 33:20.871
From Michael's call,
I know that he somehow mistrusts us.

33:24.586 --> 33:26.452
Perhaps he mistrusts himself.

33:29.591 --> 33:31.082
Is he faithful?

33:32.219 --> 33:36.384
Well, you probably know better than I.

33:37.265 --> 33:39.507
He had quite a reputation and...

33:40.185 --> 33:41.847
Well, we went through some hard times.

33:42.229 --> 33:44.141
And have you made peace with your life?

33:45.440 --> 33:47.022
What kind of question is that?

33:47.108 --> 33:48.440
I think it's a good question.

33:49.027 --> 33:53.112
Have you made peace with yourself
and your marriage the way it is?

33:54.616 --> 33:56.699
Don't worry, it's okay.

33:57.077 --> 33:59.114
I'm such a klutz.

34:04.125 --> 34:07.038
We French, we have
a different attitude about marriage

34:07.212 --> 34:09.043
than you Americans.

34:09.422 --> 34:10.583
And what is that?

34:10.966 --> 34:12.297
We are practical.

34:12.467 --> 34:15.426
We're loyal to family and to marriage...

34:16.179 --> 34:19.967
But we are human, and we follow
our natural human passions.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.427
Well, we must seem
boringly puritanical to you.

34:25.313 --> 34:28.681
And guilty. Guilt is bad for your digestion.

34:30.485 --> 34:33.649
Well, how would you say
Michael's digestion is?

34:34.155 --> 34:36.862
Well, he's an attractive man,

34:36.949 --> 34:40.114
and women do outrageous things
to get into movies.

34:41.788 --> 34:46.908
Once, a wannabe starlet
came to our table at the beach.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.458
Michael had taken off his shoes.

34:50.463 --> 34:54.002
She picked one up, poured champagne
in it and toasted him.

34:54.509 --> 34:56.592
Michael felt her desperation.

34:56.719 --> 34:59.007
So, as he sent her away,

35:00.765 --> 35:03.473
he gave her his rose gold Rolex.

35:05.645 --> 35:07.011
He didn't have to do that.

35:13.361 --> 35:14.772
I gave him that watch.

35:17.532 --> 35:19.194
He told me he lost it.

35:20.744 --> 35:23.612
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.

36:27.102 --> 36:28.843
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hi.

36:29.062 --> 36:30.143
I didn't go.

36:30.230 --> 36:34.019
My ears were killing me, so Jacques offered
to drive me to Paris.

36:34.109 --> 36:35.850
<i>Excuse me? Jacques?</i>

36:35.944 --> 36:38.687
<i>Michael let you go
with a man named "Jacques"?</i>

36:39.948 --> 36:42.031
Suzanne, come on. Michael trusts me.

36:42.117 --> 36:46.031
<i>You're driving across France with Jacques,
and you didn't call me?</i>

36:46.121 --> 36:47.487
<i>When are you picking me up?</i>

36:49.624 --> 36:52.708
He's a flirt. And he eats too much
and he smokes.

36:52.794 --> 36:55.628
<i>So do I. We're perfect for each other.</i>

36:56.589 --> 36:57.750
<i>Is he adorable?</i>

36:59.426 --> 37:03.636
Yeah. But I came on this trip
to spend some time with Michael.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.547
<i>Yeah, and look where you are.</i>

37:06.725 --> 37:08.136
<i>Seize the moment.</i>

37:08.309 --> 37:11.268
<i>Just make sure he doesn't leave you
stranded along the road somewhere.</i>

37:11.354 --> 37:12.640
Yeah, right.

37:13.106 --> 37:15.063
- <i>Gotta go.</i>
- Bye.

37:56.024 --> 37:57.356
Good morning, Brûlée.

37:57.984 --> 37:59.520
So, how are you feeling?

37:59.694 --> 38:00.684
Much better, thank you.

38:00.862 --> 38:03.104
My earache's nearly gone thanks
to those marvelous ear drops.

38:03.198 --> 38:06.362
And the medicinal quality
of fine French wine.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.192
No doubt.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.448
And the hot chocolate was
a very nice touch, thank you.

38:10.538 --> 38:12.450
I haven't had any hot chocolate for breakfast

38:12.624 --> 38:14.411
since I was at Girl Scout camp.

38:14.542 --> 38:15.623
How did you sleep?

38:15.960 --> 38:17.076
Well.

38:17.170 --> 38:19.332
I noticed you're not wearing any socks.

38:19.714 --> 38:21.706
Yes. You see everything.

38:23.051 --> 38:27.011
I didn't pack any so I washed the ones
I was wearing, but they are not dry.

38:27.222 --> 38:29.214
Well, I happen to have some of Michael's.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.969
He left them at the hotel.

38:31.351 --> 38:32.842
Would you like them?

38:33.019 --> 38:34.009
Yeah.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.729
Well, why not. Thanks.

38:39.234 --> 38:42.693
I know what it means to walk
in another man's shoes, but his socks?

38:53.748 --> 38:56.081
I'd like to pay for my room last night.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.747
Actually, I need your credit card,
if you don't mind.

39:00.505 --> 39:01.712
- Again?
- Yes.

39:01.798 --> 39:04.632
I discovered my envelope of cash
went back to Paris

39:04.717 --> 39:06.003
with my assistant by mistake.

39:07.053 --> 39:11.172
So I had to leave the charges of our rooms
and dinner on your card.

39:13.393 --> 39:14.383
Okay.

39:14.727 --> 39:16.639
You know, my name is quite common in France,

39:16.729 --> 39:20.598
and unfortunately, someone
using the same name has been

39:20.692 --> 39:22.524
charging on false cards.

39:23.111 --> 39:25.353
Until it is fixed, I have to use cash.

39:25.446 --> 39:28.985
I have enough for gas and little things,
but not for hotel and dinner.

39:30.159 --> 39:32.651
I will reimburse you
as soon as we get to Paris.

39:32.912 --> 39:33.902
Right.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.155
Okay.

39:51.973 --> 39:53.214
So I have good news.

39:53.474 --> 39:55.887
My friend got us a lunch reservation in Lyon

39:55.977 --> 39:59.141
at the restaurant with a new chef
who's got outstanding reviews.

39:59.230 --> 40:02.564
Jacques, that sounds wonderful, but
I thought we'd be in Paris by now.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.266
Paris can wait.

40:05.486 --> 40:08.399
We can't leave
without taking a look at the pyramid,

40:08.990 --> 40:10.481
as they call it here.

40:10.575 --> 40:12.316
Of course not.

40:19.792 --> 40:24.412
Two-thousand years ago this marked
the center of a Roman circus.

40:24.505 --> 40:28.920
Can you feel the chariots racing
right here where we're standing?

40:29.010 --> 40:30.501
- That's so amazing!
- Yeah.

40:32.513 --> 40:33.845
- Come.
- Wait.

40:34.182 --> 40:38.176
It's not really a pyramid, but, it's more...

40:39.687 --> 40:41.599
- Obelisk?
- Yes.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.432
Birds live in here.

40:47.820 --> 40:49.106
Do you play "I Spy"?

40:49.197 --> 40:50.438
Sounds dangerous.

40:50.531 --> 40:52.944
It's a game I used to play
with Alexandra on road trips.

40:54.535 --> 40:56.868
I spy something with four legs.

40:59.165 --> 41:01.873
I spy something with two lovely legs.

41:03.002 --> 41:03.992
Come on.

41:04.170 --> 41:05.377
Game over.

41:06.381 --> 41:07.838
Not yet.

42:08.943 --> 42:10.855
Where the hell have you been?

42:12.613 --> 42:16.448
A friend lives very nearby.
She has a garden full of roses.

42:19.454 --> 42:20.444
Excuse me.

42:21.289 --> 42:23.121
Please, come in.

42:28.629 --> 42:30.962
We'll have their perfume
until the rest of our trip.

42:38.973 --> 42:40.134
Ready?

43:00.745 --> 43:03.783
This is a perfect time
to be traveling through this region.

43:03.873 --> 43:05.330
The Rhône River is nearby.

43:05.917 --> 43:07.829
We can turn off and have a look.

43:08.961 --> 43:11.123
Are we ever going to get to Paris?

43:11.756 --> 43:13.998
Let's pretend we have a year to get there.

43:27.855 --> 43:31.769
Most of the people don't realize there
are many delicious things to eat

43:31.943 --> 43:33.980
growing right under their noses.

43:38.116 --> 43:40.278
Look, it's wild fennel.

43:41.828 --> 43:45.071
Catch a trout, grill it on a bed of that,

43:45.164 --> 43:46.951
and you have something really...

44:00.638 --> 44:02.379
- Oh, my God!
- What?

44:02.557 --> 44:04.048
I have no idea what's wrong.

44:07.353 --> 44:10.312
But look where we are,
in this beautiful countryside!

44:12.233 --> 44:13.394
Let's have a picnic!

44:14.861 --> 44:15.851
What?

44:16.028 --> 44:19.442
Jacques, I need to get to Paris,
and we have a problem.

44:20.032 --> 44:22.149
Our problem isn't going anywhere.

44:22.702 --> 44:24.534
I brought a few things from the hotel.

44:25.079 --> 44:26.069
Come on.

44:32.587 --> 44:33.873
Alex, honey,

44:35.256 --> 44:38.249
is everything all right?
It's the middle of the night there.

44:38.342 --> 44:39.503
<i>Mom.</i>

44:40.011 --> 44:41.547
What, what's the matter?

44:42.430 --> 44:44.422
<i>Noah is such a jerk!</i>

44:45.099 --> 44:46.431
What? What, what, what?

44:46.601 --> 44:49.805
<i>He finally asks me to hang out,
so, like, I meet him at Dugan's Pub,</i>

44:49.896 --> 44:52.104
<i>and he brings his two stoner roommates.</i>

44:52.607 --> 44:55.099
Honey, he was probably just nervous.

44:56.277 --> 44:58.940
Boys don't always know what they're doing,
not even big boys.

44:59.030 --> 45:01.022
Sometimes you need to take the lead.

45:01.616 --> 45:03.073
<i>That's so lame.</i>

45:03.618 --> 45:06.361
May I remind you,
this is a great time in your life?

45:07.538 --> 45:09.450
<i>Mom, I hear birds.</i>

45:10.082 --> 45:11.448
<i>Where are you?</i>

45:13.002 --> 45:16.495
I'm driving to Paris with one
of your dad's business partners.

45:17.298 --> 45:19.130
<i>That sounds so boring.</i>

45:19.467 --> 45:21.459
Oh, my God, you have no idea.

45:22.094 --> 45:24.928
Look, I've been thinking about
your birthday. I have some ideas.

45:25.097 --> 45:26.713
<i>Yeah? Okay.</i>

45:40.529 --> 45:42.020
Alex called.

45:42.782 --> 45:44.068
Is she okay?

45:44.242 --> 45:46.108
Well, she will be.

45:46.661 --> 45:47.902
It's about a boy.

45:50.456 --> 45:51.992
I don't have all the answers,

45:52.083 --> 45:55.827
but I try to slip her a little advice
when she lets me.

45:55.920 --> 45:58.207
I have a feeling you have a lot of answers.

46:01.092 --> 46:03.459
See? Wild watercress. I just found it.

46:07.139 --> 46:11.258
It's perfect, not hot and peppery
as it can get later in the season.

46:11.435 --> 46:12.425
Taste it.

46:13.020 --> 46:14.010
No.

46:14.313 --> 46:15.349
Come on, try it.

46:16.857 --> 46:19.600
Taste the wild flavor straight from nature.

46:25.449 --> 46:26.439
It's good.

46:27.201 --> 46:28.191
You see?

46:40.631 --> 46:42.293
- Look at that.
- Yeah.

46:43.884 --> 46:45.716
And this one here.

46:45.886 --> 46:48.879
So, you've just made a five-star picnic.

46:55.563 --> 46:56.553
Wonderful.

46:58.190 --> 46:59.351
Try this.

47:01.193 --> 47:02.183
Oh, wait.

47:03.904 --> 47:05.190
This is so beautiful.

47:13.831 --> 47:14.821
Delicious.

47:17.251 --> 47:18.583
But what about the car?

47:20.254 --> 47:21.461
She'll wait for us to eat.

47:22.840 --> 47:24.331
Try them all.

47:26.177 --> 47:28.214
I don't need to try everything
to know what I like.

47:34.518 --> 47:36.510
It's the first time I tried Sudoku.

47:36.687 --> 47:38.394
I like it, but I got stuck.

47:38.481 --> 47:39.767
Teach me your tricks.

47:40.900 --> 47:43.893
You look for triplets.

47:45.780 --> 47:47.692
- You see the pattern?
- Yeah?

47:47.782 --> 47:49.739
You can find it when you see three in a row.

47:59.710 --> 48:00.951
I start puzzles,

48:01.045 --> 48:04.584
but I'm not sure I have
what it takes to finish them.

48:05.299 --> 48:06.585
I think you do.

48:08.260 --> 48:10.718
You know, let's pretend
we are in that Manet painting,

48:10.888 --> 48:12.424
<i>Le déjeuner sur l'herbe.</i>

48:13.724 --> 48:14.714
Right.

48:29.782 --> 48:31.648
See? The car is still waiting.

48:32.159 --> 48:33.821
Now we have a problem.

48:39.875 --> 48:41.787
I don't think it's the radiator.

48:42.336 --> 48:43.622
I wouldn't know.

48:43.712 --> 48:45.169
Well, of course you wouldn't know.

48:45.256 --> 48:46.838
There's nothing to eat under here.

48:49.427 --> 48:51.259
Oh, my God.

48:59.854 --> 49:01.095
Fan belt!

49:01.689 --> 49:03.271
Well, yeah.

49:06.861 --> 49:08.147
Do you have your pocket knife?

49:08.320 --> 49:09.310
Yeah.

49:10.448 --> 49:11.780
All right, here. Hold this.

49:11.866 --> 49:12.856
Turn around.

49:14.869 --> 49:15.985
Turn around.

49:20.166 --> 49:24.080
Once I saw a woman on YouTube doing this.

49:24.628 --> 49:26.915
It looked simple at the time.

49:28.215 --> 49:29.422
Here.

49:29.508 --> 49:30.715
Take that side.

49:31.135 --> 49:32.376
- That one.
- Okay.

49:33.804 --> 49:35.215
Okay, cut it where your thumb is.

49:37.349 --> 49:38.339
All right.

49:38.726 --> 49:39.716
Right over left.

49:39.894 --> 49:41.010
I hope I did that right.

49:44.315 --> 49:47.729
All right, you're gonna have to fit this
around where the fan belt goes.

49:48.402 --> 49:49.734
- The...
- Try it.

49:50.362 --> 49:51.648
Where?

49:51.739 --> 49:53.822
Well, it's gotta go under the thing.

49:53.908 --> 49:55.524
- Okay, okay, I can see.
- Around the other side.

49:56.202 --> 49:57.534
It's gotta go over the whole thing.

49:57.620 --> 49:58.906
Now it's too loose.

50:01.207 --> 50:02.414
I need your knife again.

50:05.920 --> 50:07.707
All right, I think I got that right.

50:07.922 --> 50:09.254
Maybe not.

50:09.507 --> 50:10.497
Okay.

50:12.843 --> 50:14.004
Try that.

50:19.141 --> 50:20.757
- All the way. Is it all the way?
- Yeah.

50:20.851 --> 50:23.218
It's okay. Let's see if actually it works.

50:40.663 --> 50:42.905
You American women are ingenious!

51:07.648 --> 51:08.809
What's he say?

51:09.692 --> 51:11.433
He said, "You're a very clever woman."

51:29.420 --> 51:34.415
Now, let's pretend we're driving straight
to Paris in a car that works.

51:34.842 --> 51:37.710
And we don't need another thing
to eat or drink for a month.

51:37.803 --> 51:40.466
This car is designed
to make you lose your appetite.

51:40.764 --> 51:43.928
Well, it has airbags.
And I can play my music.

51:46.854 --> 51:49.016
I'm sure you know this band. They're French.

51:49.732 --> 51:52.395
Alex gave this to me.
She saw them play at the Hollywood Bowl.

51:52.693 --> 51:54.184
Yes, it's Phoenix.

51:59.158 --> 52:01.070
I just hope my car can rise from the ashes.

52:22.056 --> 52:24.389
Well, this is Lyon.

52:25.351 --> 52:27.092
We are in the heart of France.

52:28.228 --> 52:31.562
So how far are we from Paris? Be honest.

52:32.524 --> 52:34.516
Not far. We have a stop first.

52:45.579 --> 52:48.413
Well, this is L'Institut Lumière,

52:48.582 --> 52:50.699
and the two Lumière brothers, they lived here

52:50.793 --> 52:52.955
when they invented cinematography.

52:53.629 --> 52:55.086
The director is a friend of mine.

52:57.216 --> 52:58.206
Jacques!

53:15.693 --> 53:19.186
Anne has come all the way from
America to see your museum.

53:19.279 --> 53:20.360
Well.

53:20.447 --> 53:21.437
Almost.

53:21.573 --> 53:23.781
- I'm Anne.
- Martine.

53:24.618 --> 53:26.530
Well, let's go, then.

53:41.552 --> 53:45.262
Anne, Martine and I have business to discuss,

53:45.347 --> 53:47.964
so, she organized a tour for you.

53:48.475 --> 53:49.591
Yeah.

53:49.768 --> 53:51.725
Philippe will show you our museum.

53:51.854 --> 53:54.141
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

53:54.648 --> 53:55.980
Right this way, please.

54:05.451 --> 54:07.738
Then we'll move to this one.

54:08.162 --> 54:12.202
This is the Cinématographe,
which is the very first camera.

54:12.750 --> 54:16.369
It was invented by
Louis and Auguste Lumière in 1895.

54:16.462 --> 54:17.919
It is also a projector.

54:32.186 --> 54:35.600
And then you have a model
of the first public projection.

54:37.316 --> 54:42.311
And the Lumière brothers
thought their invention had no future.

54:42.988 --> 54:44.775
Apparently they were wrong.

54:45.824 --> 54:48.692
- Well, that concludes our tour.
- Thank you.

54:49.870 --> 54:52.954
I'm sorry, I have to go,
but you're free to visit the gift shop.

54:53.373 --> 54:55.490
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

55:21.401 --> 55:22.892
- Hi.
- Hi.

55:23.195 --> 55:24.686
Martine is joining us for lunch.

55:29.076 --> 55:31.944
On the way I'll show you
the best market in all of France.

55:41.255 --> 55:42.746
- Sausage from here.
- Thank you.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.126
Very good. It's the best one.

55:45.342 --> 55:47.834
<i>And look, the very best ingredients.</i>

55:47.928 --> 55:49.965
<i>All the chefs come here.</i>

55:51.515 --> 55:52.596
Wonderful!

55:53.100 --> 55:57.060
You know that there used to be
worms in old cheese?

55:57.646 --> 55:59.433
Worms? In the cheese?

56:00.274 --> 56:02.607
So you had in the same time
cheese and the meat.

56:04.862 --> 56:08.276
This family has been selling cheese
for over 200 years.

56:08.699 --> 56:11.533
Look at <i>les fromages de chèvre.</i>
This is goat cheese.

56:11.702 --> 56:14.285
There is so many different kinds.

56:14.746 --> 56:17.489
<i>My favorite is Crottin de Chavignol.</i>

56:18.292 --> 56:19.282
Anne.

56:21.295 --> 56:22.456
Thank you.

56:24.798 --> 56:25.879
Be my guest.

56:27.217 --> 56:28.458
It's great, no?

56:28.594 --> 56:30.460
- No worms.
- No worms.

56:44.318 --> 56:45.525
Please.

56:47.321 --> 56:48.482
It's tasty, no?

56:48.572 --> 56:51.815
You know, they found fava
beans in the Egyptian tombs.

56:53.160 --> 56:56.119
Jacques, remember those
divine fava beans we had

56:56.204 --> 56:59.038
in that marvelous little place in Palermo?

57:01.919 --> 57:04.252
And in Sardinia, we had puréed favas

57:04.338 --> 57:07.297
served with those delicious
wild bitter greens.

57:11.136 --> 57:13.594
It seems to me that the two of you
would like a chance to catch up.

57:14.431 --> 57:16.844
And I'm not very hungry,
so I think I'm gonna take a little walk.

57:17.017 --> 57:18.349
- No, no.
- No, no, it's fine.

57:18.518 --> 57:20.180
- Please, please, sit down.
- No, you two catch up.

57:20.354 --> 57:24.064
Absolutely not. You've got
to taste this food. Please, sit down.

57:26.318 --> 57:27.308
All right.

57:36.370 --> 57:37.360
Escargot.

57:38.872 --> 57:41.285
Here, these are delicious.

57:42.542 --> 57:45.535
They've changed chefs,
but the snails are still good.

57:47.047 --> 57:49.835
You must never cook a dead snail, never.

57:50.133 --> 57:52.625
They must always be cooked alive.

57:52.719 --> 57:56.087
- It's true.
- It's a nightmare how they kill snails.

57:56.848 --> 57:59.841
They put some salt
and get rid of all this bile.

58:00.018 --> 58:02.886
You need to purge the snails
before you cook them.

58:03.397 --> 58:05.935
They have to empty the intestines.

58:08.777 --> 58:11.895
This is a roasted cock from Bresse, yes?

58:11.989 --> 58:13.821
And usually it has blue feet.

58:13.907 --> 58:15.318
This is the best in France.

58:15.659 --> 58:16.775
Yes, and look...

58:16.868 --> 58:18.200
They serve the breast first

58:18.286 --> 58:21.245
and cook the legs
a little longer, to perfection.

58:21.581 --> 58:25.871
And, you have to eat it with rissoles,

58:26.086 --> 58:27.873
potatoes fried in duck fat.

58:28.505 --> 58:31.964
And this is morel, mushrooms.

58:37.597 --> 58:38.804
Escargot!

58:42.144 --> 58:45.262
That is a beautiful shawl, Martine.
Where did you get it?

58:46.273 --> 58:48.356
It belonged to my Russian grandmother.

58:49.026 --> 58:51.939
It's full of moth holes, but I still love it.

58:54.114 --> 58:58.108
Well, it's a beautiful example
of early-1900s paisley.

58:59.453 --> 59:02.116
Well, if you're interested in fabrics,

59:02.247 --> 59:04.955
there is an excellent textile museum
a few blocks away.

59:05.083 --> 59:07.746
You should go and see it.
Don't you think so, Jacques?

59:08.045 --> 59:09.536
No, no, please, we're going to Paris.

59:09.755 --> 59:11.621
Please don't give him any ideas.

59:11.965 --> 59:14.207
Jacques, this has to be our last stop.

59:14.634 --> 59:15.920
- Okay?
- All right.

59:29.983 --> 59:31.315
Hey!

59:31.401 --> 59:35.315
Look at this exquisite embroidery
from the 18th century!

59:35.989 --> 59:38.276
Can you believe it was all done by a man?

59:40.285 --> 59:41.401
Of course it was.

59:43.330 --> 59:44.741
Come see his picture.

59:45.248 --> 59:46.238
Here he is!

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:13.690
I'm sorry.

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:15.935
I'm sorry.

01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:43.637
You're naughty because I think you knew.

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:49.143
Well, I've got to go back to work.

01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:54.478
Anne, don't be in a hurry
to go back to Paris.

01:00:55.068 --> 01:00:57.560
You'll never forget
your travels with Jacques.

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:00.275
Trust me.

01:01:20.427 --> 01:01:22.214
That was a very touching goodbye.

01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:23.961
Yeah.

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:28.345
I told her to get a pair of sensible shoes.

01:01:29.728 --> 01:01:31.264
Of course you did.

01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:42.772
Okay, Jacques. I've had enough detours.

01:01:43.116 --> 01:01:45.358
It's straight to Paris now, right?

01:01:47.621 --> 01:01:49.783
Let's hear more of your music.

01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:41.725
When I see the first new moon,

01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:44.731
faint in the twilight...

01:03:45.238 --> 01:03:48.652
I think of the moth eyebrows

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:52.368
of a girl I saw only once.

01:03:53.038 --> 01:03:55.155
- A haiku.
- Nice.

01:03:56.207 --> 01:03:58.574
The changing of the moon reminds me that

01:03:58.752 --> 01:04:01.790
life and business have cycles.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:03.837
Sometimes full, and sometimes not.

01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:08.084
You seem to live as if it's always full.

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:10.803
Anne, I have to tell you that...

01:04:10.889 --> 01:04:12.630
Look! Vezelay!

01:04:12.724 --> 01:04:13.805
Did you see the sign?

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:17.309
I had no idea we were so close.

01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:21.730
Let's make a little detour
and see the beautiful cathedral there.

01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:23.023
Who are you?

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:25.693
And what have you done
with my American friend

01:04:25.779 --> 01:04:28.271
always in a hurry to get to Paris?

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:31.573
Don't I get a turn to choose a stop?

01:04:31.743 --> 01:04:33.826
It's straight to Paris.

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:50.843
<i>Richard the Lionhearted began
the Third Crusade from here.</i>

01:05:04.984 --> 01:05:08.443
They say there are bones
of Mary Magdalene under the altar.

01:05:11.157 --> 01:05:12.523
- <i>See those columns?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:14.742
<i>Each one tells a story.</i>

01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:40.494
You can tell me your sadness, Anne.

01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:47.247
It happened a long time ago.

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:49.962
But it's still with you.

01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:54.375
Yes. And it always will be.

01:07:02.143 --> 01:07:03.259
David.

01:07:05.396 --> 01:07:09.686
He had a heart defect,
and he lived only 39 days.

01:07:13.947 --> 01:07:16.940
He was always surrounded
by nurses and doctors, but...

01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:19.112
He knew me.

01:07:21.496 --> 01:07:23.488
He held onto my finger...

01:07:24.582 --> 01:07:27.746
And fought so hard every minute of his life.

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:36.091
I'm so sorry.

01:07:40.932 --> 01:07:42.548
I thought I would die.

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:47.804
His father, my first husband...

01:07:48.648 --> 01:07:50.640
He couldn't handle it, he left.

01:07:52.151 --> 01:07:55.986
One day, I wandered into a church...

01:07:57.323 --> 01:08:01.488
And there was an alcove with the
Virgin Mary holding her infant son.

01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:06.572
And suddenly I felt connected...

01:08:08.293 --> 01:08:11.502
To all the mothers who have
lost a child down through time.

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:29.929
I wear this to remind me

01:08:30.481 --> 01:08:32.598
how fragile life is,

01:08:33.276 --> 01:08:37.862
and how painful
and exquisite it is to be alive.

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:46.286
Anne, you're human.

01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:50.790
And you've been to the depths
of what that means.

01:09:08.853 --> 01:09:10.890
Anne...

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:12.937
Food is good for the soul.

01:09:17.069 --> 01:09:19.562
This place is supposed
to be the best in Vezelay.

01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:21.814
- Great.
- Please.

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:25.283
- Jacques, I need to make a phone call.
- Okay. Of course.

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:36.752
- <i>This is the voicemail box for...</i>
- <i>Michael Lockwood.</i>

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:38.917
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:41.087
Hey, honey, it's me.

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:42.667
I just miss you...

01:09:42.761 --> 01:09:45.175
<i>The mailbox is full
and cannot accept any messages at this...</i>

01:09:50.978 --> 01:09:52.264
Man.

01:09:57.944 --> 01:09:59.435
Yes, of course.

01:09:59.696 --> 01:10:01.813
Listen, I need an advance. Yeah.

01:10:03.116 --> 01:10:07.486
Come on, you know our new picture
will be a big hit in the UK.

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:10.537
No, I need the money now, damn it!

01:10:21.718 --> 01:10:22.799
You'll drink for both of us.

01:10:23.636 --> 01:10:24.797
We still have a long drive.

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:31.309
It's a Cuvée Silex,
from Domaine Daguenau 2012.

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:33.635
Of course.

01:10:35.606 --> 01:10:40.226
It has a crisp mineral note
that expresses the terroir.

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:44.780
And the vineyard subsoil is calcareous chalk.

01:10:46.325 --> 01:10:49.238
It's giving something
really special for this wine.

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:52.159
Because it's very deep and...

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:54.156
I am boring you.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.366
No. No, no.

01:10:56.461 --> 01:10:58.168
I mean, yes.

01:11:00.006 --> 01:11:03.090
It's just a little intimidating,
how much you know about wine.

01:11:03.176 --> 01:11:04.337
It's just knowing what you like.

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:06.794
My happiest memories are around the table.

01:11:09.015 --> 01:11:11.553
And I'm here now with you.

01:11:21.194 --> 01:11:22.526
Excuse me.

01:11:29.035 --> 01:11:30.025
What's wrong?

01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:34.363
It's Alex. She's decided to go camping
with friends for her birthday.

01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:40.619
It'll be the first birthday in her life
that I won't be with her.

01:11:46.093 --> 01:11:48.631
You've taught her how to be happy on her own.

01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:51.714
Now it's your turn. And you're in Burgundy.

01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:07.479
Look at this.

01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:10.987
No, it's good, but who needs this fuss?

01:12:11.828 --> 01:12:16.289
I remember going into the garden
with my mother and picking tomatoes...

01:12:16.374 --> 01:12:20.664
Really ripe, red ones in August.
Bringing them into the kitchen,

01:12:20.753 --> 01:12:22.710
still warm from the sun.

01:12:23.256 --> 01:12:25.339
She'd put slices on fresh bread,

01:12:25.424 --> 01:12:30.089
add good olive oil, sea salt
and fresh ground pepper and say,

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:32.592
"Jacques, you'll never eat better."

01:12:34.559 --> 01:12:35.595
She was right.

01:12:36.435 --> 01:12:38.848
The best food in the world
is straight from the garden

01:12:38.938 --> 01:12:42.852
with very little done to it.
Authentic, like you.

01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:51.110
So, what did your family eat, Anne?

01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:54.151
I grew up in Cleveland.

01:12:55.246 --> 01:12:56.612
Nobody's perfect.

01:12:57.456 --> 01:13:00.039
No, our idea of fine dining
was fried chicken,

01:13:00.126 --> 01:13:02.539
mashed potatoes, and frozen peas.

01:13:03.838 --> 01:13:06.626
I didn't learn about good food
until I went to California.

01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:10.126
There is one thing from my past
that I make well, though.

01:13:10.511 --> 01:13:11.968
Lemon meringue pie.

01:13:12.346 --> 01:13:13.336
Great.

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:16.177
Sometimes I think
Michael married me for my pie.

01:13:17.476 --> 01:13:19.058
He married you for much more than your pie.

01:13:32.116 --> 01:13:34.654
This butter from Brittany
is the best we have in France.

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:37.410
Now, there is a trip we should take.

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:43.076
The coastline, the oysters,
the cider, and <i>les galettes bretonnes...</i>

01:13:43.336 --> 01:13:46.920
Those wide and thin buckwheat pancakes.

01:13:47.924 --> 01:13:49.631
I love pancakes.

01:13:51.677 --> 01:13:52.667
Excuse me.

01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:53.835
Thank you.

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:56.763
- Michael!
- <i>Everything okay?</i>

01:13:56.849 --> 01:13:59.091
Yeah, I was just checking in to see what's...

01:13:59.185 --> 01:14:02.053
<i>I think I'm over this whole producing thing.</i>

01:14:02.521 --> 01:14:06.265
<i>Once Alex is out of school,
let's talk about Plan B.</i>

01:14:06.525 --> 01:14:08.608
<i>Honey, there are problems
on the Morocco shoot.</i>

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:12.362
<i>I have to go there ASAP
with a big fire extinguisher.</i>

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:15.282
Well, when would that put you in Paris?

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:17.860
<i>I can hardly hear you. Where are you?</i>

01:14:18.537 --> 01:14:20.369
I'm in a restaurant.

01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:21.529
<i>With Jacques?</i>

01:14:21.874 --> 01:14:22.864
Well, yeah.

01:14:27.171 --> 01:14:28.412
<i>Listen, Anne.</i>

01:14:30.091 --> 01:14:31.627
<i>Jacques can be very charming,</i>

01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:34.630
<i>and Frenchmen have no scruples
when it comes to married women.</i>

01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:41.136
I'll keep that in mind.

01:14:41.894 --> 01:14:43.977
<i>Call me as soon as you get to the apartment.</i>

01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:47.348
- <i>Love you.</i>
- Love you, too.

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:04.914
"Nipples of Venus."

01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:07.993
It's their specialty.

01:15:21.767 --> 01:15:23.008
Oh, my goodness.

01:15:31.277 --> 01:15:32.939
You've been taking a lot of photos.

01:15:34.238 --> 01:15:35.695
Let me see what you've got there.

01:15:36.073 --> 01:15:37.359
They're nothing, really.

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:39.445
Come on. Show me.

01:15:58.888 --> 01:16:00.470
You have a beautiful eye for detail.

01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:05.467
They are very evocative.

01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:06.677
You think?

01:16:06.771 --> 01:16:08.478
Yeah. You don't show the whole thing.

01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:12.023
You make me imagine the complete picture.

01:16:12.485 --> 01:16:13.601
Do you make prints?

01:16:13.694 --> 01:16:14.684
No.

01:16:15.112 --> 01:16:19.777
Although I've thought of making
some large prints of a few images.

01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:27.455
What does Michael think of your photos?

01:16:27.625 --> 01:16:29.742
- I haven't really shown him.
- Why not?

01:16:30.211 --> 01:16:32.373
I don't think he sees me as a photographer.

01:16:33.172 --> 01:16:36.040
I mean, he asks to see them,
but I think he's just being nice.

01:16:36.717 --> 01:16:38.674
Michael is a nice guy.

01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:41.211
Why are you not revealing yourself

01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:44.469
to the man you've been with for 20 years?

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:52.851
See?

01:16:53.025 --> 01:16:54.812
How beautiful you are.

01:16:59.031 --> 01:17:00.112
It's a wedding.

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:09.030
- I like this music.
- Yeah?

01:17:17.883 --> 01:17:21.251
Let's pretend we are in that Renoir painting,
<i>Danse à Bougival.</i>

01:17:22.721 --> 01:17:24.178
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

01:17:30.396 --> 01:17:31.386
Okay.

01:18:23.908 --> 01:18:25.444
Your very own Sudoku book.

01:18:26.744 --> 01:18:27.734
Thank you.

01:18:27.953 --> 01:18:29.114
Some chewing gum.

01:18:29.622 --> 01:18:31.363
- It's better for you than smoking.
- Yeah.

01:18:38.797 --> 01:18:40.914
You seem to really like kids.

01:18:41.634 --> 01:18:43.296
Do you ever wish you'd had your own?

01:18:44.803 --> 01:18:49.047
Well, I have a nephew, Jean-Louis.

01:18:49.225 --> 01:18:50.636
He's like my son.

01:18:53.729 --> 01:18:56.221
He was two when my brother died.

01:19:02.321 --> 01:19:03.311
I'm sorry.

01:19:11.038 --> 01:19:12.324
He thinks it was an accident.

01:19:12.414 --> 01:19:16.533
He doesn't know
his father's death was suicide.

01:19:22.675 --> 01:19:25.759
I kept it secret.

01:19:27.805 --> 01:19:29.421
I never told anyone.

01:19:33.352 --> 01:19:35.685
My brother and I had a company together.

01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:38.930
I didn't see it coming.

01:19:41.527 --> 01:19:43.359
That's so painful.

01:19:44.363 --> 01:19:45.353
I'm sorry.

01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:51.201
How lucky his son is to have you.

01:19:55.207 --> 01:19:56.539
I'm lucky, too.

01:20:10.723 --> 01:20:14.808
So, Brûlée, now, tell me, what was
the happiest moment in your life?

01:20:16.562 --> 01:20:19.555
When Alexandra was born and the doctor said,

01:20:19.857 --> 01:20:21.894
"You have a healthy baby girl."

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:26.152
For me it was...

01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:28.981
Playing tag with my brother in the garden

01:20:29.074 --> 01:20:31.612
while my mother picked vegetables for dinner.

01:20:42.087 --> 01:20:45.671
<i>So tell me, Brûlée,
where are you staying in Paris?</i>

01:20:46.342 --> 01:20:47.833
<i>Our friends have an apartment.</i>

01:20:48.594 --> 01:20:50.586
<i>We like to stay there when they're away.</i>

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:48.601
So this is your friends' apartment?

01:21:57.830 --> 01:22:02.825
Jacques, I can't begin to tell you
how much this trip has meant to...

01:22:06.338 --> 01:22:07.579
For me, too.

01:22:30.154 --> 01:22:32.692
The way our friend taught us
the code, I'll never forget.

01:22:33.866 --> 01:22:36.700
"A" "52"-year-old woman

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:38.026
can "B"

01:22:38.704 --> 01:22:41.242
with a "38"-year-old guy.

01:22:41.707 --> 01:22:42.697
Of course.

01:22:47.713 --> 01:22:48.794
Where is your apartment?

01:22:48.881 --> 01:22:50.964
It's on what you call the third floor.

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:53.462
- There's an elevator.
- Great.

01:22:54.887 --> 01:22:57.846
But it's... Well, you'll see. It's French.

01:22:58.724 --> 01:23:00.056
It's really tiny.

01:23:07.107 --> 01:23:08.097
Thank you.

01:23:12.321 --> 01:23:14.938
So, I promised I'd return you to Paris

01:23:15.032 --> 01:23:17.149
without so much as holding your hand.

01:23:17.242 --> 01:23:18.608
And I did it.

01:23:19.703 --> 01:23:21.239
Who did you promise?

01:23:22.915 --> 01:23:24.122
Me.

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:17.543
<i>Hi, Anne. Hope you got in okay.</i>

01:24:17.636 --> 01:24:19.502
<i>I left some things in the refrigerator.</i>

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.216
<i>Call me if you need anything.</i>

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:23.506
<i>Are you there, Annie?</i>

01:24:23.684 --> 01:24:26.051
<i>Annie? Annie?</i>

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.596
<i>You're not answering your cell phone.</i>

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.641
<i>Baby, where are you?</i>

01:24:33.068 --> 01:24:34.229
<i>I have to leave early in the morning.</i>

01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:38.192
<i>I'm packing. My socks don't match.
I'm no good without you.</i>

01:24:39.324 --> 01:24:40.485
<i>Please call me.</i>

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:42.817
<i>Damn it, where are you?</i>

01:24:43.412 --> 01:24:47.577
<i>Honey, remind me to never
let you go with a Frenchman again.</i>

01:24:51.295 --> 01:24:52.706
<i>Hey, it's me again.</i>

01:24:52.796 --> 01:24:56.415
<i>I canceled Morocco.
I'll be in Paris tomorrow.</i>

01:24:57.175 --> 01:24:58.586
<i>It's gonna be just us.</i>

01:25:00.596 --> 01:25:01.757
<i>I love you, Annie.</i>

01:25:16.695 --> 01:25:17.685
Who is it?

01:25:18.196 --> 01:25:19.937
Delivery for <i>madame.</i>

01:25:23.493 --> 01:25:25.155
Your roses, <i>madame.</i>

01:25:57.736 --> 01:25:59.352
Let's not pretend anymore.

01:26:00.405 --> 01:26:01.737
I never was.

01:26:03.492 --> 01:26:05.233
You opened something in me.

01:26:06.662 --> 01:26:08.198
I'm not used to feeling like this.

01:26:08.288 --> 01:26:09.620
Me either.

01:26:17.339 --> 01:26:18.329
- Jacques.
- What?

01:26:18.423 --> 01:26:19.789
You really must go.

01:26:22.761 --> 01:26:26.254
Anne, we both know better
than to miss this moment.

01:26:28.266 --> 01:26:30.098
We haven't missed it.

01:26:44.449 --> 01:26:47.942
I leave for London today, but I will be
in San Francisco on the 15th.

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:51.363
I'll save you a seat at the bar

01:26:51.456 --> 01:26:54.449
at Swan's Oyster Depot at 1:00 p.m.

01:26:55.168 --> 01:26:56.830
Bring some prints of your photos.

01:26:57.212 --> 01:26:58.578
Jacques.

01:26:58.672 --> 01:27:01.210
Yes. We'll drive up the coast, and...

01:27:01.425 --> 01:27:03.667
The food won't be as good as Brittany, but

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:07.841
what does it matter,
when you're on the road with Brûlée?

01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:37.742
<i>Bonjour,</i> Anne.

01:27:54.186 --> 01:27:55.518
Who is it?

01:28:01.902 --> 01:28:02.892
Thank you.

01:28:08.617 --> 01:28:09.858
It's for me!

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:28.842
Chocolate roses.
