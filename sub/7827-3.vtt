the washer and dryer

03:31.502 --> 03:32.962

03:33.046 --> 03:36.674

03:36.758 --> 03:38.218

03:38.301 --> 03:40.178
Look, Burns,
this is a big problem.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.138
You just can't throw money at it
and make it go away.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.973

03:44.057 --> 03:45.558
there will be
no investigation.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.185
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll go away.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.687
You're in big trouble, Burns.
Homer Simpson's job

03:49.771 --> 03:52.148

the neighborhood

04:13.461 --> 04:15.171
and thought we'd stop by.

04:15.255 --> 04:18.508
Would you like to come in for
tea and marshmallow squares?

04:18.591 --> 04:20.718
(murmuring)

04:20.802 --> 04:22.220
Yes, he would.

04:22.303 --> 04:24.222
So you want me
to go to college?

04:24.305 --> 04:25.390
College?

04:25.473 --> 04:27.684
-Ha! Barber or clown?
-Bart!

04:27.767 --> 04:30.687
Remember, your job and
the future of your family

04:30.770 --> 04:32.188
hinges on your
successful completion

04:32.272 --> 04:33.231
of Nuclear Physics 101.

04:33.314 --> 04:35.900
Oh, and one more thing.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.236
You must find
the jade monkey

04:38.319 --> 04:40.863
before the next full moon.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.865
Actually, sir,
we found the jade monkey.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.742
It was in
your glove compartment.

04:44.826 --> 04:45.827
And the road maps
and ice scraper?

04:45.910 --> 04:47.078
They were in there too, sir.

04:47.161 --> 04:49.205
Excellent!

04:49.289 --> 04:51.249
It's all
falling into place.

04:51.332 --> 04:53.626
I think this is
a great opportunity.

04:53.710 --> 04:54.961
You could learn so much.

04:55.044 --> 04:56.129
Maybe you're right.

04:56.212 --> 04:58.131
I did always want
to go to college.

04:58.214 --> 05:00.967
But fate stood in the way.

05:03.177 --> 05:05.972
Homer, sign this application
and you're a shoo-in.

05:06.055 --> 05:08.099

application essays throw you.

favorite books

-No.

-Son of Sniglet?
-No.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.918
-Katherine Hepburn's "Me"?
-No!

05:36.002 --> 05:37.670

05:42.884 --> 05:44.719

05:44.802 --> 05:47.555
Thanks, boy.
Now for the crowning touch.

05:50.391 --> 05:51.684
I don't know, Dad.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.019
Don't you have
a better picture?

05:53.102 --> 05:54.729
Relax. A photo
can't make any difference.

05:57.398 --> 05:59.067
-He looks crazy.
-Agreed.

05:59.150 --> 06:01.486

don't you?

07:46.757 --> 07:48.926

07:49.010 --> 07:51.095
Yes, well, to have
a successful baseball club

07:51.179 --> 07:52.930
you need teamwork.

Homer,
that isn't very nice.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.495
Marge,
try to understand.

08:57.578 --> 08:59.830
There are two kinds
of college students:

08:59.914 --> 09:01.499
jocks and nerds.

09:01.582 --> 09:05.127
As a jock, it is my duty
to give nerds a hard time.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.337
Hey, pal!

09:06.420 --> 09:08.005
Did you get a load

09:52.508 --> 09:54.385
I'm always up

a comprehensive review session

10:42.767 --> 10:43.726

we kidnap Sir Oinkcelot.

19:05.185 --> 19:07.187
And all those other pranks
were my idea too.

19:07.271 --> 19:09.940
I'm the one

19:10.023 --> 19:11.525
Well, I'm touched

19:11.608 --> 19:13.068

-Yes, you have.
-How's this?

19:17.698 --> 19:19.783
I'll re-admit your friends,

Oh, Dean.

Ah, no problem, guys.

19:44.641 --> 19:47.269

Actually, I've been
working on a plan.

20:04.536 --> 20:07.247
During the exam,
I'll hide under some coats,

20:07.331 --> 20:09.833
and hope that somehow
everything will work out.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.293
Or with our help,

20:11.376 --> 20:15.088
you can cram like you've
never crammed before!

20:15.172 --> 20:16.381
Whatever.
Either way is good.

20:26.266 --> 20:27.267
(grunts)

20:31.313 --> 20:33.398
Whoo-hoo!

20:37.444 --> 20:39.988
Oh, man. I can't believe
you failed.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.032
Oh, I'm gonna lose my job

20:42.115 --> 20:44.826
just 'cause I'm
dangerously unqualified!

20:44.910 --> 20:46.662
Mr. Simpson,
there is a way.

20:46.745 --> 20:47.996
We could, well,

20:48.080 --> 20:49.790
use a computer
to change your grade.

20:49.873 --> 20:51.917
(gasps)
Computers can do that?

20:52.000 --> 20:55.295
Oh, yes. The only problem is
the moral dilemma it raises,

20:55.379 --> 20:56.880
-which requires--
-(kissing)

20:56.964 --> 20:59.299
Oh, I love--
Moral whuzzah?

20:59.383 --> 21:02.469
An A-plus!
How did you do it?

21:02.552 --> 21:05.180
Oh, let's just say
I had help from

21:05.264 --> 21:07.307
a little magic box.

21:07.391 --> 21:08.684
You changed your grade
with a computer?

21:08.767 --> 21:09.726
D'oh!

21:09.810 --> 21:11.061
Way to go, Dad!

21:11.144 --> 21:12.437
Look, the important thing

21:12.521 --> 21:14.773
is that
we all learned a lesson.

21:14.856 --> 21:17.150
These guys learned
the richness and variety

21:17.234 --> 21:19.319
of the world outside college.

21:19.403 --> 21:20.737
-No, we didn't.
-Oh.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.907
Then I learned
the real value of college

21:23.991 --> 21:25.867
is to study and work hard.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.119
No, you didn't.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.329
You only passed
your course by cheating,

21:29.413 --> 21:30.706
which you always taught us
was wrong.

21:30.789 --> 21:33.542
-Hmm. True.
-And I learned that

21:33.625 --> 21:35.627
in order for you to set
a good example for your son,

21:35.711 --> 21:38.255
you're gonna take that course
over again without cheating.

21:38.338 --> 21:39.756
Oh, Marge!

21:39.840 --> 21:42.134
You're worse than
that crusty old dean.

21:42.217 --> 21:43.844
(sighs)

21:43.927 --> 21:45.971
Well, I guess it's back
to college for me.

21:46.054 --> 21:49.308
And that means it's time to--
What did I teach you guys?

21:49.391 --> 21:51.560
NERDS: Par-ty down?

21:51.643 --> 21:53.395
