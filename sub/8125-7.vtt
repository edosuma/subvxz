Well, I know
it's here somewhere.

What do you need
the instant glue for, Archie ?

03:01.981 --> 03:04.883
You can't find it,
huh, Edith ?
I didn't say that.

03:04.950 --> 03:07.118
Well, show me
where it is, huh ?

03:08.720 --> 03:10.721
Can't you use a nail ?

Edith, if you can't find
the thing, why don't you
simply say so ?

I can't find it.

you can't use a nail ?

How am I gonna nail
a toilet roll holder
to that tile wall up there ?

Oh, very hilarious.

I'd like to see youse two
chasing that roll
across the bathroom floor.

03:34.646 --> 03:37.515
I busted my head
on the bathtub.

03:37.582 --> 03:39.517
Archie, that holder's
been off for days.

03:39.584 --> 03:41.853
Well, why didn't you
fix it, meathead, huh,

03:41.921 --> 03:46.390
instead of layin'
around here all of the time,
tryin' to swallow your wife ?

03:46.458 --> 03:50.428
All right.
I'll pick up some tile cement
and fix it tomorrow, okay ?

03:50.495 --> 03:52.864
Whoa, listen to
the boy, Edith.

03:52.932 --> 03:57.268
He's actually threatenin'
to do somethin' around here.

Daddy, stop it.
Michael does more odd jobs
around the house than you do.

04:00.739 --> 04:04.542
She's right, Archie.
He did fix the light
in the kitchen.

04:04.609 --> 04:06.644
The polack
changed a lightbulb.

04:06.712 --> 04:09.147
Don't make out
he rewired the joint.

04:10.816 --> 04:14.118

I did more than change
a lightbulb.

04:14.186 --> 04:16.120
And for your
further edification,

04:16.188 --> 04:18.189
calling me a polack
is not gonna bother me.

That this individual
was comin' over

05:57.189 --> 06:00.891

to tell you that we invited
Paul to stay over tonight.

But, Archie,
any friend of the kids
is a friend of ours.

06:13.505 --> 06:16.941

Not necessarily.

Oh, Archie. Paul,
you're welcome here anytime.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.714

- Oh, no, Archie.

- Our doormat says "welcome."
- No, Edith, our doormat
says "the bunkers."

-But I'm sure it says "welcome."
-Well, we'll settle it
right now, Edith.

and I'll show youse all

06:42.267 --> 06:44.702
I'm sure it does.
<i>Edith !</i>

06:45.971 --> 06:48.939
Why does our doormat
say "the mcnabs" ?

06:52.544 --> 06:55.380
Oh, that's right,
I forgot.

06:55.447 --> 06:59.617
Ellen mcnab's police dog
chewed our mat up last month,

06:59.684 --> 07:02.387
and I couldn't very well
ask her to pay for it.

07:02.454 --> 07:05.223
I mean, what with the dog
getting so sick.

07:07.192 --> 07:10.995
So I let her lend us theirs
until we got a new one.

07:11.063 --> 07:14.798
We can't have this
outside our house, Edith.
We ain't the mcnabs.

07:14.866 --> 07:18.736
Well, the Petersons' doormat
says "welcome,"

07:18.803 --> 07:20.971
but I couldn't very well
borrow theirs.

07:21.040 --> 07:24.675
After all,
it wasn't their dog
that chewed up our mat.

07:24.743 --> 07:28.012
What has the Petersons' dog
got to do with anything ?

07:28.080 --> 07:30.248
The Petersons
don't have a dog.

07:31.750 --> 07:34.118
Petersons,
bunkers or mcnabs,

"welcome" on it.

Listen, I'll just drop it
outside for you, and then
I'll bring my things in.

07:42.861 --> 07:46.431
He's gonna bring his things in ?
Why did you say that weirdo
could stay overnight ?

07:46.498 --> 07:50.401
Daddy, Paul is not
a weirdo, and besides,
you used to like him.

07:50.469 --> 07:53.837
Yes, I liked him
when he was a nice, clean
engineerin' student.

07:53.905 --> 07:56.774
He used to dream
about building
Bridges and banks.

07:56.841 --> 07:59.710
Now he looks like someone
who wants to blow 'em up !

07:59.778 --> 08:01.712
There you go again,
labeling people.

08:01.780 --> 08:05.483

what Paul looks like and
accept him for what he is ?

08:05.551 --> 08:08.252
All right.
What is he ?

08:08.320 --> 08:11.255
He's a nice boy,
and he only wants
to stay for one night.

08:11.323 --> 08:13.558
He's leaving for Europe
in the morning.

09:02.608 --> 09:05.510
- Ask them if they're married.
- No, we're not <i>legally</i> married,

if that's
what you mean,
Mr. bunker.

09:07.613 --> 09:10.615
Tell them that's exactly
what Mr. bunker means.

Robin and Paul, sit down
and make yourself
comfortable, all right ?

09:13.885 --> 09:15.819
Daddy, they're not
going anywhere.

09:15.887 --> 09:19.857
Yes, they are. They're going
to a motel-- him and her and all
their elegant luggage here.

09:19.924 --> 09:22.493
- They can't afford a motel.
- They're going to Europe,
ain't they ?

09:22.561 --> 09:24.262
<i>[ Mike ]</i>
<i>So what ?</i>
<i>They can afford that.</i>

09:24.329 --> 09:27.231
It's a charter flight,
Mr. bunker. We've saved
our money for months.

09:27.299 --> 09:30.968
-We've got every penny budgeted.
-Tell him that I'd hate
to unbalance his budget,

09:31.036 --> 09:34.972
but he ain't stayin' here
with her together--
not without a marriage license.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.041
It's immoral, tell him.

09:37.108 --> 09:39.544
And you decide
what's moral, huh ?

09:39.611 --> 09:42.112
No, wise guy, that does.

09:42.181 --> 09:44.182
The television set ?

09:46.751 --> 09:48.752
No ! The Bible !

09:48.820 --> 09:52.590
Edith, why do you
leave the Bible
on the television set ?

09:54.125 --> 09:56.994
Because it keeps
falling off the refrigerator.

10:01.132 --> 10:03.701
So, that's it.
Daddy, wait.
You can't do this to them.

10:03.768 --> 10:07.205
So they're not married
in the conventional sense.

10:07.272 --> 10:09.207
They happen
to love each other.

10:09.274 --> 10:11.309
That's right,
and it's love
that counts, isn't it ?

10:11.376 --> 10:15.879

may be okay in some places,
but not here !

10:15.947 --> 10:18.549
This is a Christian home.

10:18.617 --> 10:20.618

10:27.826 --> 10:31.862
Fine. When Jeff comes in,
make sure to have him call me

10:35.400 --> 10:37.668

Jeff's still out,
but as soon as he gets back,

10:44.276 --> 10:46.410
he's gonna call us
and put us up for sure.

10:46.478 --> 10:50.448
Why don't they just
get married and save
all this bother ?

10:50.515 --> 10:52.516

You're married.

10:52.584 --> 10:55.253
I know, ma, but they
don't believe in it.

10:55.320 --> 10:58.656
Oh, how can daddy
send them away like this ?
I'm so embarrassed.

10:58.724 --> 11:01.325
He's just against people
openly expressing
love for each other.

11:01.393 --> 11:03.527
No, no,
it ain't that.

11:03.595 --> 11:06.096
He just don't
like 'em expressing it

a house of "ill refute."

11:39.731 --> 11:43.066
- Put it out.
- I thought you were
going to bed, daddy.

11:43.134 --> 11:45.969
Not till I get
this thing settled. Did he
get his telephone call ?

11:46.037 --> 11:49.206
Yeah, he made the call.
Jeff wasn't in,
but Paul left a message.

11:49.274 --> 11:51.241
Good. I hope he gets
the message soon.

11:51.310 --> 11:53.644
Edith, hurry up
with my cocoa, huh ?

11:53.712 --> 11:57.315
I wanna get to sleep.
I gotta go to work
in the mornin'.

11:57.382 --> 12:02.186
Archie, you could be
in bed right now if you weren't
so narrow-minded about this.

12:02.253 --> 12:04.188
I ain't narrow-minded.

12:04.255 --> 12:07.725
I just refuse to have
any uncertified goings-on
under this roof.

12:07.793 --> 12:11.028
No, no. No, no.
You just got
a hang-up about sex.

12:11.095 --> 12:13.230
I ain't got no hang-up
about... that.

12:16.067 --> 12:18.803
No hang-ups ?
You can't even say
the word "sex."

12:18.870 --> 12:22.906
There's women around here,
you palooka. I don't use
four-letter words around women.

12:24.309 --> 12:27.745
Admit it, daddy.
Your whole generation's
afraid of sex.

12:27.813 --> 12:31.248
Oh, listen, little girl.
If I was afraid of it,
you wouldn't be here.

12:32.917 --> 12:34.852
Right, Edith ?

12:45.797 --> 12:47.765
Right, Edith ?

12:48.900 --> 12:50.901
I'm trying to remember.

12:57.141 --> 13:01.712
What do you
have to remember ?
She's here, ain't she ?

13:01.780 --> 13:04.348
The point I'm tryin' to make
is that my generation...

13:04.416 --> 13:06.717
Had a little respect
for its "womenhood."

13:06.785 --> 13:10.888
Do you think I would've spent
a night with your mother before
we had a wedding license ?

13:10.955 --> 13:13.257
I wouldn't let him.

13:16.728 --> 13:18.962
Will you stifle yourself.

13:20.499 --> 13:22.566
You're sayin', then,
that with a marriage license--

13:22.634 --> 13:26.103
a slip of paper from
a total stranger-- you'd let
our friends stay here ?

13:26.170 --> 13:28.506
Bull's-eye.

13:28.573 --> 13:31.975
I don't get it, daddy.
What is so important
about a piece of paper ?

13:32.043 --> 13:35.245
"What is so important
about a piece of paper ?"

13:35.313 --> 13:38.549
That piece of paper makes
the whole thing legal--

13:38.617 --> 13:40.984
the whole setup,
that's all.

13:41.052 --> 13:45.022
With that paper,
you can go up to any desk clerk
in any hotel in the country,

13:45.089 --> 13:48.959
look him straight in the eye
and say, "gimme a double room."

13:49.027 --> 13:52.029
Yeah, but is the license
the thing that keeps
people together,

13:52.096 --> 13:54.164
or is it what
they feel for each other ?

13:54.232 --> 13:57.000
Without the license,
you ain't supposed
to feel nothin'.

13:59.671 --> 14:03.974
Archie, I don't think
it could be the license
that keeps us together.

14:04.042 --> 14:06.009
We never see it.

14:06.077 --> 14:10.614
The last time I saw it,
it was up in the attic
with Gloria's layette.

14:10.682 --> 14:15.586
It's in the same trunk
with my autographed picture
of kay kyser.

14:17.388 --> 14:19.389
I wanna ask you
something, Archie.

14:19.458 --> 14:21.425
Say mom and you
didn't have a license.

14:21.493 --> 14:23.427
I mean, supposin' mom
couldn't find it.

14:23.495 --> 14:25.930
Would that mean
that Paul and Robin
are as married as you ?

14:25.997 --> 14:30.568
No, wise guy, because
your mother-in-law and me,
we took our sacred vows.

14:30.635 --> 14:35.205
I'm glad you mentioned that,
Mr. bunker, because, you see,
we took our vows too.

14:35.273 --> 14:37.475
Tell him if he didn't
take 'em in church,

14:37.542 --> 14:39.477
then God
didn't hear 'em.

14:39.544 --> 14:44.114
He ain't married
in the ears of God.
But wouldn't Mr. bunker agree...

14:44.182 --> 14:46.116
That God
is everywhere ?

14:46.184 --> 14:50.588
Tell him he certainly is.
Then he was there
when we took our vows.

14:50.655 --> 14:53.958
But he wasn't listenin'.
Not without the license !

14:55.627 --> 14:57.995
Wow.
Oh, wow, wow, wow.

14:58.062 --> 15:00.097
See, these guys
are all the same.

15:00.164 --> 15:04.234
They take one fall
in an argument and they
throw in the towel.

15:04.302 --> 15:06.570
Well, in the words
of Harry s. Truman,

15:06.638 --> 15:10.073
"if it's too hot in the kitchen,
stay away from the cook."

15:13.011 --> 15:15.312
Archie, instead of
putting 'em down
all the time,

15:15.380 --> 15:17.314
why don't you sit
with Paul and Robin,

15:17.382 --> 15:19.316
talk to them,
find out about them.

15:19.384 --> 15:21.785
Maybe you wouldn't be
so uptight.
Why don't you, daddy ?

15:21.853 --> 15:25.055
Edith, what are
they eatin' here ?
Raw vegetables.

15:25.123 --> 15:27.424
It looks like the bottom
of a hamster's cage.

15:29.160 --> 15:31.896
Come on, Archie.
Sit down here and
talk with 'em, huh ?

15:31.963 --> 15:34.264
All right, all right.
I'll sit down.

15:34.332 --> 15:38.569
I'll have a chat with 'em.
Let me ask you
somethin' there, Paul.

15:38.637 --> 15:41.672
Exactly why
did you become a freak ?

15:44.743 --> 15:47.811
- <i>[ Mike ] Oh, Archie !</i>
<i>- I'll tell you, Mr. bunker.</i>

15:47.879 --> 15:50.614
I just didn't like
the idea of being one...

15:50.682 --> 15:52.883
Of thousands
of young engineers...

15:52.951 --> 15:55.953
All doing the same thing,
leading the same life,

15:56.021 --> 15:59.489
seeking the same goals
day after day after day.

15:59.558 --> 16:02.960
To me, they're the freaks
because they aren't happy.

16:03.028 --> 16:04.962
Let me tell you something,
young fella.

16:05.030 --> 16:08.599
When you grow up, you'll realize
there's more to life than
bein' happy. Right, Edith ?

16:08.667 --> 16:10.601
Believe me.

16:12.003 --> 16:13.938
Now, did you hear that,
little girl ?

16:14.005 --> 16:16.473
Did you hear the point
we're just makin' right here ?

16:17.809 --> 16:19.743
What's the matter, sis ?
Can't you talk ?

16:19.811 --> 16:22.546
<i>No, Robin</i>
<i>doesn't talk much.</i>

16:22.614 --> 16:24.748
Well, what does
Robin do, chirp ?

16:26.685 --> 16:28.819
How does she communicate
to people ?

16:28.887 --> 16:33.591
You see, Robin thinks
words are a waste of time,
so she speaks with her eyes.

16:33.658 --> 16:36.594
Oh.

16:36.661 --> 16:40.497
Well, open up wide and let's
hear the gettysburg address.

16:40.565 --> 16:44.001
- Archie, will you cut it out !
- Tell them to cut it out !

16:44.069 --> 16:47.671
I'm sittin' here tryin' for
a little give-and-take
with your friends,

16:47.739 --> 16:50.941
but I ain't never yet
learned how to converse
with a pair of eyeballs.

16:51.009 --> 16:54.211
Daddy, we don't make fun
of your friends,

16:54.278 --> 16:57.648
and believe me, they look
just as ridiculous to us.

16:57.716 --> 17:00.751
That's right.
You oughta look at 'em
for once in your life.

17:00.819 --> 17:03.153
Take a look at some of those
paunchy, cigar-chewin',
beer-swillin'--

17:03.221 --> 17:07.257
- hold it, meathead, hold it !
- Oh, oh ! Anyone's a meathead
doesn't agree with you, huh ?

17:07.325 --> 17:11.294
Yeah, anyone who shows
a little independence.
Gloria, let me finish.

17:11.362 --> 17:14.131
All right,
but don't yell at me.
I wasn't yelling at you.

17:14.198 --> 17:17.200
I was yelling at him.
You happened to be
in the line of my yell.

17:17.268 --> 17:20.237
Well, you are yelling--
shh, shh !

17:22.073 --> 17:24.273
What's the matter
with youse,

17:24.342 --> 17:26.376
yellin' that way ?

17:26.444 --> 17:28.879
You think the neighbors
is interested in listenin'
to youse two--

17:28.947 --> 17:31.214
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh !
Edith ! Edith !

17:31.282 --> 17:34.752
- Ooh, Edith, the shoe !
- No ! Don't anybody
touch him !

17:34.819 --> 17:38.388
What is it ?
His toe is gone.
It's a toe spasm.

17:38.456 --> 17:42.993
He often gets them in
the middle of the night in bed
when the sheet's too tight.

17:43.061 --> 17:45.262
And sometimes, ooh,
they come three a night,

17:45.329 --> 17:49.033
and once they start,
they come regular--
11 minutes apart.

17:49.100 --> 17:51.702
Get the shoe off, will ya !

17:51.770 --> 17:54.938
Ooh ! Leave it alone, Edith.
Let me walk on it, huh ?

17:55.006 --> 17:57.174
Get away from me, you.

17:57.241 --> 17:59.677
Ooh !
Oh, look, Archie.
Your sock is too tight.

17:59.744 --> 18:02.713
That's what caused it.
You better change
to a size 10.

18:02.781 --> 18:07.317
You gained a lot of weight.
How do you gain weight
in your toes, Edith ?

18:07.385 --> 18:09.820
It's exhaustion
that brought this on.
I'm up too late.

18:09.888 --> 18:12.622
I gotta go to work
in the morning,
I gotta sleep.

18:12.691 --> 18:15.893
I can't wait
for that phone call !
Get rid of these people !

18:15.960 --> 18:18.862
Archie, why don't you
just go to sleep ?
We'll wait up.

18:18.930 --> 18:21.565
We'll see that
they leave with Jeff.
I think it's over, Edith.

18:21.632 --> 18:23.967
Good.
All right.
It's feelin' better now.

18:24.035 --> 18:26.770
Sit down
and put your shoe on.
Yeah, gimme the shoe.

18:26.838 --> 18:29.173
Now, you stay
away from me !
I never touched you.

18:29.240 --> 18:32.976
Wait. I got an idea.
I don't know why we didn't
think of this before.

18:33.044 --> 18:35.545
Daddy, what if we all
slept dormitory-style ?

18:35.613 --> 18:38.015
Huh ?
[ Mike ] That's it.
That's perfect.

18:38.083 --> 18:40.884
The girls upstairs
and the guys downstairs.
Yeah, that would be nice.

18:40.952 --> 18:43.921
Yeah, let 'em
do it, Archie.

18:43.988 --> 18:48.926
Listen, you better get to bed.
Your toe's got ten minutes
to another spasm.

18:48.993 --> 18:51.895
Come on.
What do you say ?

18:53.031 --> 18:55.032
If I say yes,
you two kids promise me...

18:55.100 --> 18:57.868
Everything's gonna be kosher ?
[ Gloria ]
Promise, promise.

18:57.936 --> 19:00.170
All right, dormitory-style.

19:00.238 --> 19:04.574
Boys downstairs here,
and the girls can go
upstairs there, and everything--

19:04.642 --> 19:06.576
what are you shakin'
your head about ?

19:06.644 --> 19:08.812
She's s-saying it
would be hypocritical--

19:08.880 --> 19:13.450
that for two people in love,
such an arrangement would be
immoral and unnatural.

19:16.955 --> 19:18.889
You just said all that
to him ?

19:20.959 --> 19:23.627
Do you realize
what time it is, huh ?

19:23.694 --> 19:27.697
Do you realize
it's 12:30 A.M. in the mornin',
little miss head shaker ?

19:27.766 --> 19:29.900
Well, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

19:29.968 --> 19:32.502
I got a ten-dollar bill here,
and here it is.

19:32.570 --> 19:34.504
Now, youse are both
gonna go to a motel,

19:34.572 --> 19:37.174
and when you get there,
I don't care what youse do.

19:37.242 --> 19:39.643
Youse can swing
from the chandeliers,
for all I care.

19:39.710 --> 19:42.980
I'm gonna get my sleep--
what are you shakin'
your head for now ?

19:43.047 --> 19:46.083
She's saying
it's not right for you
to try to bribe us.

19:46.151 --> 19:48.551
It ain't right
to bribe them.
Do you hear that ?

19:48.619 --> 19:50.620
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it !

19:50.688 --> 19:52.856
I can't believe it !

19:52.924 --> 19:55.259
Have some cocoa.
It'll help relax your toe.

19:57.028 --> 20:00.297
Paul, uh,
under the circumstances--

20:00.364 --> 20:02.800
I mean, what if Jeff
never shows up ?

20:02.867 --> 20:05.869
Then we'll just
stay here like you offered.
But look at the old man.

20:05.937 --> 20:09.306
Look at his condition.
He offered you the money.
Michael's right.

20:09.373 --> 20:11.341
You see that, Robin,
don't you ?

20:11.409 --> 20:15.412
Look, Robin,
I know it's not like
what we planned, but--

20:15.479 --> 20:17.714
would you stop with
the head shaking
and talk to me ?

20:17.782 --> 20:19.883
You see, Robin feels...

20:19.951 --> 20:22.419
That it would be
self-defeating
for us to leave now.

20:22.486 --> 20:25.655
That's bull.
You wanna know
something else ?

20:25.723 --> 20:28.025
This no-talking routine
is bull too !

20:28.092 --> 20:30.194
You don't understand, man.
See, Robin says--

20:30.261 --> 20:32.362
we don't care
what Robin says.
Robin, shut up.

20:34.532 --> 20:36.466
<i>[ Doorbell ringing ]</i>
<i>Oh, that's Jeff.</i>

20:36.534 --> 20:39.469
It's about time.
Come on in.

20:39.537 --> 20:42.306
Is this the bunkers' ?
Your doormat says "mcnab."
It's the bunkers'.

20:42.373 --> 20:47.144
Hey ! When I got your message,
I just came right over.
I didn't even bother to call.

20:47.212 --> 20:49.146
That's okay.
I'll get my stuff.

20:49.214 --> 20:51.248
Jeff Walker,
that's Mike and Gloria,

20:51.316 --> 20:53.250
and that's
Mr. and Mrs. bunker.

20:53.318 --> 20:55.252
How are you ?
Hello.
Mike, Gloria.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.254
[ Edith ]
How do you do ?

20:57.322 --> 20:59.356
Hey. Aw,
this is beautiful.

20:59.423 --> 21:02.226
Hey, what's
happening, man ?

21:02.293 --> 21:04.228
I'm havin' a stroke.

21:05.463 --> 21:07.931
Far out. I can dig it.
I can really dig that.

21:07.999 --> 21:10.934
You must be really
spaced out, man.
Stop talkin'.

21:12.803 --> 21:15.505
You gonna take
them two with ya ?
Oh, yeah, no sweat.

21:15.573 --> 21:18.342
You can start
talkin' again.
That's really heavy--

21:18.409 --> 21:20.510
<i>[ Paul ]</i>
<i>Hey, Jeff, let's split.</i>
<i>Okay, groovy.</i>

21:20.578 --> 21:24.181
Uh, uh, Jeff.
Meet my old lady, Robin.
[ Chuckles ]

21:24.249 --> 21:27.517
Your old lady ?
Oh, wow.

21:27.585 --> 21:30.620
Hey, man, you didn't
tell me that you had
your old lady with you.

21:30.688 --> 21:33.891
Now, I know this is gonna be
a bummer, but I'm gonna
have to cop out on you.

21:33.958 --> 21:36.559
What's that ?
What do you mean ?
What does "cop out" mean ?

21:36.627 --> 21:39.529
Can't do it.
See, it's not me.
It's my dad.

21:39.597 --> 21:43.967
He's got this hang-up about
people having to be married
before they can crash together.

21:44.035 --> 21:45.969
What's "crash together" ?
Sleep together.

21:46.037 --> 21:48.438
Don't say that !

21:48.506 --> 21:52.376
My dad would never let you guys
spend a night in his house.

21:52.443 --> 21:54.444
Isn't that a downer ?
Yeah, it's a downer.

21:54.512 --> 21:57.480
It's an upper
and a bummer and a hummer
and anything else, is what.

21:59.483 --> 22:02.219
But you're gonna take
them two people
the hell outta here !

22:02.287 --> 22:04.587
Yeah, right, right.
I'm very sorry, guys.

22:04.655 --> 22:08.292
Right, right, he's very sorry ?
Where's he goin' ? Where are
you goin' there, shorty ?

22:08.359 --> 22:11.895
Come back here !
Don't put them things down !
You ain't stayin' here !

22:11.963 --> 22:14.898
Come on back here !
Hey, you're supposed

I got one more thing
to say to you-- ooh !

Edith, the shoe, the shoe !
The shoe, Edith ! Oh !
Archie, I warned you !

Eleven minutes.
Oh, take the shoe off !

22:37.922 --> 22:42.692
Oh, my. You made it
to the airport
and back so fast.

22:42.760 --> 22:45.528
We just dropped them off.
We didn't even bother
goin' inside.

22:45.596 --> 22:49.799
Yeah, they have about
six hours to wait,
sleepin' on those hard benches.

22:49.867 --> 22:53.503
What do you want ?
It's their fault. They
could've stayed at a motel.

22:53.571 --> 22:57.174
Hey, how come Archie
isn't in bed yet ?

22:57.241 --> 23:01.845
He fell asleep while I
was puttin' the food away,
and I was afraid to wake him.

23:01.912 --> 23:03.847
Hmm.
You wanna wake him ?

23:07.651 --> 23:09.886
No. Not me.
Uh-uh.

You ? You wanna
wake him ?
Are you kidding ?

[ Giggling ]
He's not nice
when he wakes up.

23:15.093 --> 23:16.893
No !

23:16.961 --> 23:19.463
Hey, ma, what you got
in that old envelope ?

23:19.530 --> 23:22.866
I was lookin' for
our marriage license
in the attic.

23:22.933 --> 23:25.802
And, mm, remember
I told you I had...

23:25.870 --> 23:28.305

Yeah.
Well...

23:31.342 --> 23:33.877

Look here.
Now, look.

Let's go to sleep, huh ?
Yeah.

23:51.295 --> 23:53.230
Oh, wait a minute.
But what about Archie ?

23:53.297 --> 23:56.033
We can't leave him there
sleepin' all night.

23:56.100 --> 23:58.835
Well, he's
your husband, ma.
Yeah. Good luck.

23:58.903 --> 24:01.738
- Oh, help me, somebody.
- Wait, wait.

24:01.805 --> 24:05.708
We can't leave mom
alone like this.
We're a family.

24:05.776 --> 24:09.513
We've got to
stick together, by gum.
Let's all wake him up.
