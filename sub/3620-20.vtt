WEBVTT

00:03.351 --> 00:05.309
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I GOT UP EARLY

00:05.483 --> 00:07.137
ON MY HUSBAND'S
DAY OFF FOR THIS.

00:07.311 --> 00:08.791
STOP COMPLAINING.
WE'RE GETTING CLOSE.

00:08.965 --> 00:10.619
CLOSE TO WHAT?
GETTING KILLED?

00:10.793 --> 00:12.403
WE SCRIBED FOR EVIL,
AND IT WAS HERE.

00:12.577 --> 00:15.537
YEAH,
BECAUSE THEIR NAMES
ARE CHRISTY AND BILLIE.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.539
I'M TELLING YOU,
IT CAN'T BE THEM.

00:17.713 --> 00:19.758
WHY NOT? THEY'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE
THE ULTIMATE POWER.

00:19.932 --> 00:22.631
YEAH, BUT I STILL THINK
THEY'RE BEING MANIPULATED
BY SOMETHING.

00:22.805 --> 00:25.286
OR MAYBE YOU'RE JUST
AVOIDING THE INEVITABLE.

00:25.460 --> 00:26.939
PIPER, I TOLD YOU.

00:27.114 --> 00:29.203
IF WE NEED TO TAKE DOWN
BILLIE AND CHRISTY, I'M THERE.

00:29.377 --> 00:30.769
SERIOUSLY. BUT...

00:30.943 --> 00:32.815
I STILL THINK THERE'S
SOMETHING ELSE BEHIND THEM.

00:34.295 --> 00:36.906
AND...WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S BEHIND THAT DOOR.

00:41.215 --> 00:42.607
WHAT HAVE WE GOT
TO LOSE, RIGHT?

00:42.781 --> 00:44.435
AH, YOU KNOW.
JUST OUR LIVES.

00:44.609 --> 00:46.611
LOOK, WE'RE NOT
EVEN READY TO DEAL
WITH BILLIE AND CHRISTY,

00:46.785 --> 00:48.396
LET ALONE WHAT MAY
OR MAY NOT BE

00:48.570 --> 00:49.962
BEHIND DOOR
NUMBER 3.

00:51.138 --> 00:53.009
WELL, THE SOONER
WE FIND OUT,
THE BETTER.

01:01.670 --> 01:03.367
ALL RIGHT. NOW THAT
WE'VE ASCERTAINED

01:03.541 --> 01:06.283
IT'S A CREEPY,
EMPTY ROOM,

01:06.457 --> 01:07.676
I THINK WE CAN GO.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.243
JUST BECAUSE WE DON'T
SEE ANYTHING

01:09.417 --> 01:10.679
DOESN'T MEAN
IT'S NOT THERE.

01:10.853 --> 01:13.073
THIS PLACE IS GIVING ME
REALLY CREEPY VIBES.

01:13.247 --> 01:14.378
MM-HMM.

01:14.552 --> 01:16.076
ME, TOO.
I'M WITH PAIGE.
LET'S GO.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.729
THIS ROOM'S NOT EVEN
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE, RIGHT?

01:17.903 --> 01:20.602
WELL, WHETHER IT IS
OR IT'S NOT...LET'S GO!

01:20.776 --> 01:21.559
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING IN HERE.

01:21.733 --> 01:22.821
OK.

01:22.995 --> 01:24.649
THAT'S ENOUGH.
LET'S GO.
OK .

01:37.140 --> 01:38.620
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

01:38.794 --> 01:40.230
ACTUALLY, I THINK
YOU GOT THAT BACKWARDS.

01:41.318 --> 01:42.928
Christy: WAIT!

01:43.103 --> 01:44.060
STOP.

01:44.234 --> 01:45.975
I MEAN IT.

01:46.149 --> 01:47.237
SO, WHAT? ARE THESE
HALL MONITORS

01:47.411 --> 01:48.630
WORKING FOR YOU NOW?

01:48.804 --> 01:49.848
Paige: DOES BILLIE
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

01:50.022 --> 01:51.372
BILLIE'S NOT
YOUR CONCERN ANYMORE.

01:51.546 --> 01:53.374
AND NEITHER IS
THIS PLACE.

01:53.548 --> 01:54.636
SO JUST GO, NOW.

01:55.724 --> 01:57.291
SORRY. THAT'S
A NO-CAN-DO.

01:57.465 --> 01:58.466
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO, PAIGE?

01:58.640 --> 01:59.815
ARE YOU GONNA
VANQUISH ME?

01:59.989 --> 02:01.860
OH, WAIT.

02:02.034 --> 02:04.515
I'M HUMAN.
AND THAT'S MURDER.

02:04.689 --> 02:06.126
THAT'S ILLEGAL,
ISN'T IT?

02:06.300 --> 02:09.346
THAT IS, UNLESS
IT'S SELF-DEFENSE.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.001
I GUESS WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO SEE HOW THIS
PLAYS OUT THEN, WON'T WE?

02:12.175 --> 02:13.002
[SIGHS]

02:13.176 --> 02:14.351
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.

02:14.525 --> 02:16.223
WE'LL BE SEEING
YOU AGAIN.

02:21.445 --> 02:22.751
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

02:22.925 --> 02:24.100
YES. BUT I...

02:24.274 --> 02:26.450
WAS TOLD THEY WERE HERE.

02:26.624 --> 02:27.843
I THOUGHT--

02:28.017 --> 02:30.324
I PROMISED MY SISTER
THEY WOULDN'T BE HURT.

WAS IT EASIER DEALING
WITH ALL OF THIS STUFF

04:32.228 --> 04:34.448
WHEN LEO WAS MORTAL,
OR WHEN LEO WAS MAGICAL?

04:34.622 --> 04:36.493
IT WAS EASIER WHEN
HE WAS STILL AROUND.

04:36.667 --> 04:38.147
WELL, OBVIOUSLY.

04:38.321 --> 04:39.757
I JUST MEAN, YOU KNOW,

04:39.931 --> 04:41.542
BEING PULLED AWAY
BY DEMONS ALL THE TIME.

04:41.716 --> 04:44.240
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS KIND OF
A TOSS-UP.

04:44.414 --> 04:47.069
WHEN HE WAS MAGICAL,
HE UNDERSTOOD MORE

04:47.243 --> 04:49.680
BUT WHEN HE WAS HUMAN,
HE WAS IN MORE DANGER.

04:49.854 --> 04:51.378
SO I WAS MORE WORRIED.

04:51.552 --> 04:52.727
SO WHAT I'M
HEARING YOU SAY

04:52.901 --> 04:54.729
IS THAT IT PRETTY MUCH
SUCKS EITHER WAY.

04:54.903 --> 04:56.861
YES, BASICALLY.

04:57.035 --> 04:58.559
HUH. FANTASTIC.

04:58.733 --> 05:00.474
BUT YOU JUST GOT MARRIED,
YOU KNOW. GIVE IT SOME TIME.

05:00.648 --> 05:01.562
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.

05:01.736 --> 05:02.737
BUT, SEE, THAT'S THE THING.

05:02.911 --> 05:04.216
I DON'T WANT TO
GET USED TO IT.

05:04.391 --> 05:05.957
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GO
AWAY WITH MY HUSBAND,

05:06.131 --> 05:07.307
GO OUT, DO THINGS,
WITHOUT ALWAYS BEING

05:07.481 --> 05:09.091
CALLED BACK
ON SOME EMERGENCY.

05:09.265 --> 05:11.485
HMM. YES. WELL,
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

05:12.616 --> 05:14.444
HEY, PIPER? PAIGE?
COME HERE!

05:14.618 --> 05:16.054
NOW
WHAT'D SHE FIND?

05:16.228 --> 05:18.622
PROBABLY ANOTHER REASON
TO AVOID COOP.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.105
I THINK I I.D.'d
THE NEW POWER.

05:23.279 --> 05:25.629
YEAH? ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE JUST NOT TRYING

05:25.803 --> 05:27.414
TO KEEP BUSY
TO AVOID--

05:27.588 --> 05:29.416
PIPER, I TOLD YOU.
IF WORSE COMES TO WORSE,

05:29.590 --> 05:30.808
I WILL TOTALLY--

05:30.982 --> 05:32.244
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
BILLIE AND CHRISTY.

05:32.419 --> 05:33.768
I'M TALKING ABOUT COOP.

05:33.942 --> 05:35.247
Paige: WHAT ABOUT COOP?

05:35.422 --> 05:37.685
YEAH, WHAT ABOUT COOP?

05:40.427 --> 05:41.776
I LOVE COOP.

05:41.950 --> 05:45.257
OK? I'M
IN LOVE WITH COOP.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.477
I LOVE HIM, AND I
JUST CAN'T HELP IT.

05:47.651 --> 05:49.305
BUT THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

05:49.479 --> 05:50.741
HEY, IT'S COMPLETELY
UNDERSTANDABLE.

05:50.915 --> 05:52.308
YOU'RE MISERABLE THAT
HE CAN'T LOVE YOU BACK.

05:52.482 --> 05:54.223
HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO,

05:54.397 --> 05:57.052
AND SO YOU'D LIKE TO
TAKE YOUR FRUSTRATIONS
OUT ON SOME DEMONS.

05:57.226 --> 05:59.315
CAN WE PLEASE
JUST FOCUS HERE?

05:59.489 --> 06:01.491
WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME,
AND WE HAVE NO IDEA

06:01.665 --> 06:02.797
WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST.

06:02.971 --> 06:04.276
SINCE WE CAN'T GO
BACK TO MAGIC SCHOOL

06:04.451 --> 06:05.539
BECAUSE IT'S NOT
SAFE FOR US,

06:05.713 --> 06:07.062
I COMPILED A LITTLE
LIST HERE

06:07.236 --> 06:08.759
OF ALL THE GOOD
MAGICAL CREATURES

06:08.933 --> 06:10.805
THAT HAVE HELPED US
IN THE PAST.

06:10.979 --> 06:13.198
WHY ARE LEPRECHAUNS
AT THE TOP OF THE LIST?

06:13.373 --> 06:14.286
WELL, BECAUSE THEY HAVE LUCK.

06:14.461 --> 06:15.853
AND WE NEED LUCK.

06:16.027 --> 06:17.594
Piper: YEAH, BUT
ISN'T THAT LIKE
THROWING THEM

06:17.768 --> 06:18.987
INTO THE LION'S DEN?

06:19.161 --> 06:20.989
NO. I MEAN, IT HAS TO DO
WITH THEM, TOO.

06:21.163 --> 06:22.469
IT'S GOOD VERSUS EVIL,
YOU KNOW.

06:22.643 --> 06:23.687
IT AFFECTS ALL OF US.

06:23.861 --> 06:25.428
Paige: WHAT HAPPENED,
IN MY LIFE,

06:25.602 --> 06:27.909
THAT I WOUND UP
HAVING TO TALK
TO LEPRECHAUNS SO MUCH?

06:28.083 --> 06:29.824
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

06:29.998 --> 06:31.216
BUT YOU KNOW THEM BEST.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.436
OK. YOU AND I
ARE GONNA GO UPSTAIRS

06:33.610 --> 06:34.742
AND SEE IF WE CAN

06:34.916 --> 06:37.005
I.D. CHRISTY'S NEW
HALL MONITOR FRIEND.

06:44.447 --> 06:46.362
[DOOR OPENS]

06:46.536 --> 06:48.843
HEY, THERE YOU ARE.

06:49.017 --> 06:50.322
KIND OF BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

06:50.497 --> 06:51.889
WELL, I'VE JUST BEEN HERE.

06:52.063 --> 06:53.413
DOIN' WHAT?

06:53.587 --> 06:55.066
JUST WRITING STUFF DOWN.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.851
ABOUT THE SISTERS.

06:57.025 --> 06:59.549
THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S...
THAT'S REALLY GOOD, BILLIE.

06:59.723 --> 07:01.638
WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT
THEIR WEAKNESSES ARE.

07:01.812 --> 07:03.597
YEAH, WELL, I'M HOPING
WE CAN DISEMPOWER THEM

07:03.771 --> 07:04.859
SO WE DON'T HAVE
TO HURT THEM.

07:05.033 --> 07:06.338
WHO ARE YOU KIDDING, BILLIE?

07:06.513 --> 07:07.949
IT'S GONNA TAKE A HELL
OF A LOT MORE THAN THAT

07:08.123 --> 07:09.385
TO STOP THEM,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

07:09.559 --> 07:10.821
NO, I DON'T KNOW IT.

07:10.995 --> 07:13.737
I MEAN, BESIDES,
PIPER HAS KIDS!

07:13.911 --> 07:15.260
SHE HAS A BABY,
FOR GOD'S SAKES!

07:15.435 --> 07:17.349
HOW CAN YOU EVEN THINK
OF WANTING TO HURT A MOM?

07:17.524 --> 07:19.395
WHAT ABOUT OURMOM?

07:19.569 --> 07:22.267
SHE DIDN'T HAVE
ANY CONCERN ABOUT HER.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.356
LOOK, I DIDN'T
SEEK WITH OUT, BILLIE.

07:24.531 --> 07:25.836
THIS WAS GIVEN TO ME.

07:26.010 --> 07:27.969
IT WAS GIVEN TO US.

07:28.143 --> 07:31.059
YEAH. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO
TAKE DOWN THE MOST POWERFUL
WITCHES OF ALL TIME.

07:31.233 --> 07:32.539
THAT'S WHAT THIS
NIGHTMARE'S ALL ABOUT.

07:33.670 --> 07:34.715
SO NOW I'M A NIGHTMARE.

07:34.889 --> 07:36.368
NO. GOING AGAINST
GOOD PEOPLE IS.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.936
THEY'RE NOT GOOD
PEOPLE, BILLIE.

07:39.110 --> 07:40.851
IF THEY WERE, WE WOULDN'T
BE IN THIS POSITION.

07:41.025 --> 07:42.766
THEY'VE LOST THEIR WAY.

07:42.940 --> 07:44.420
AND THE LONGER IT TAKES
FOR YOU TO FIGURE THAT OUT,

07:44.594 --> 07:46.466
THE MORE TIME THEY HAVE
TO ATTACK US.

07:48.076 --> 07:49.469
LIKE THEY TRIED
TO DO TODAY.

07:51.035 --> 07:51.993

TALKING ABOUT?

COME AFTER US, FINE.

08:00.262 --> 08:01.611

WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

08:03.134 --> 08:04.919
IF WE GIVE THEM ENOUGH
TIME TO ATTACK US,

08:05.093 --> 08:06.747
WE'LL DIE.

DID ME A FAVOR, OK?

08:39.127 --> 08:40.781
WHICH I--I SO APPRECIATE.

BUT I JUST NEED
THIS ONE THING.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.785

09:19.254 --> 09:21.517

09:34.008 --> 09:36.010
YOU'RE CUNNING,
YOU'RE BRAVE...

09:36.184 --> 09:37.098
GOOD-LOOKIN'...

09:37.272 --> 09:39.143
YOU'RE...DAMN GOOD-LOOKING.

09:39.317 --> 09:40.841
I MEAN, THAT'S FOR SURE.

09:41.015 --> 09:42.146
BUT, HEY!

09:42.320 --> 09:43.060
IF YOU DON'T WANNA
HELP ME STOP

09:43.234 --> 09:44.279
THE ULTIMATE POWER,

09:44.453 --> 09:46.368
THAT'S OK!
I'LL JUST, UH...

09:46.542 --> 09:47.848
I'LL JUST GO ASK
THE GNOMES.

09:48.936 --> 09:50.198
WHAT?!

09:50.372 --> 09:52.461
THE GNOMES ARE IDIOTS!

09:52.635 --> 09:54.985
Y-YOU CAN'T TRUST 'EM
ANY FURTHER THAN YOU
CAN THROW 'EM!

09:55.159 --> 09:56.552
HMM.

09:59.163 --> 10:01.209
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL DO IT.

10:01.383 --> 10:02.993
BUT WE DON'T LIKE IT.

10:14.309 --> 10:15.615
[SIGHS]

10:16.877 --> 10:17.791
ALL RIGHT, PHOEBE, I--

10:22.491 --> 10:24.928
[COUGHS] JEEZ. WHAT, ARE YOU
MAD AT ME OR SOMETHIN'?

10:25.102 --> 10:28.802
[CHUCKLES] NO, OF COURSE NOT.
WHY WOULD I BE MAD AT YOU?

10:28.976 --> 10:30.281
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

10:30.455 --> 10:31.674
SO I THINK I FOUND YOU
THE MAN OF YOUR DREAMS.

10:31.848 --> 10:33.284
[SIGHS] OH, REALLY.
DO YOU?

10:33.458 --> 10:34.895
YES. YES, I DO.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.287
AND I THINK HE'S
PERFECT FOR YOU.

10:36.461 --> 10:38.725
HE'S AN AID WORKER
IN BANGLADESH.
HMM!

10:38.899 --> 10:40.944
HE'S A RUGGED,
HANDSOME...YOU KNOW...

10:41.118 --> 10:42.859
A REAL DO-GOODER TYPE.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.644
OF COURSE, THERE'S
THE LONG-DISTANCE THING,

10:44.818 --> 10:46.428
AND YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO GET SHOTS.

10:46.602 --> 10:50.084
OK, YEAH. I'M NOT
GONNA GET VACCINATIONS
TO GO MEET A GUY.

10:50.258 --> 10:52.695
AND WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU COULDN'T FIND
ANYONE IN THE AREA?

10:52.869 --> 10:54.001
WELL, YEAH. YEAH.
SURE, I CAN.

10:54.175 --> 10:57.004
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
YOU UNDERSTAND

10:57.178 --> 10:58.919
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS.

10:59.093 --> 11:00.921
IT'S NOT MY FAULT THAT
YOU REJECT EVERY GUY
THAT I BRING.

11:01.095 --> 11:02.270
WAIT. EVERY GUY?

11:02.444 --> 11:04.359
COOP, THERE'S BEEN
ONE GUY. ONE.

11:04.533 --> 11:05.839
YEAH, BUT HE WAS
A REALLY GOOD GUY.

11:06.013 --> 11:07.144
OK. YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

11:07.318 --> 11:09.016
I THINK THAT YOU...

11:09.190 --> 11:11.322
JUST HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I WANT.

11:11.496 --> 11:14.456
[SNICKERS] NO, I KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THAT
YOU'RE LOOKIN' FOR.

11:14.630 --> 11:18.068
OH. NO. TRUST ME.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

11:18.242 --> 11:20.244
AH. THEN WHY DON'T YOU
ENLIGHTEN ME?

11:26.598 --> 11:28.992
[LONG SIGH]

11:30.472 --> 11:31.473
YOU.

11:34.476 --> 11:35.390
[SIGHS]

11:35.564 --> 11:38.262
AND I KNOW
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

11:38.436 --> 11:41.526
BECAUSE OF...THE RULES,
AND EVERYTHING. BUT...

11:41.701 --> 11:44.268
[HEAVY SIGH]

11:44.442 --> 11:45.487

12:08.728 --> 12:10.077
UH...

12:10.251 --> 12:12.209
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GO,
I'M THINKIN'. YOU KNOW?

12:12.383 --> 12:13.776
YEAH. UH...
WE'LL, UH...

12:13.950 --> 12:15.082
[CLEARS THROAT]
TALK TO YOU LATER.

12:15.256 --> 12:18.650
OK. YEAH.
[BREATHING DEEPLY]

12:18.825 --> 12:20.000
OH, GOD. I KNOW.
I KNOW.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.653
IT'S FORBIDDEN LOVE.

12:21.828 --> 12:24.004
AND I'M DOOMED. AND--AND--
AND WE'RE...DOOMED,

12:24.178 --> 12:25.614
AND EVERYTHING IS DOOMED!

12:25.788 --> 12:27.007
THAT ABOUT
SUMS IT UP.

12:27.181 --> 12:28.312
[SIGHS]
WELL, AT LEAST

12:28.486 --> 12:30.010
YOU'RE NOT AVOIDING
ANYTHING ANYMORE.

12:30.184 --> 12:31.489
[SPLASHES SOMETHING IN POT]

12:31.663 --> 12:33.535
DID YOU HAPPEN TO I.D.
CHRISTY'S HALL MONITOR?

12:33.709 --> 12:35.929
AH, YEAH. BUT, UH,
HE'S GOTTA GET AWAY
FROM MAGIC SCHOOL

12:36.103 --> 12:37.495
BEFORE WE CAN DO ANYTHING.

12:37.669 --> 12:38.932
OK. THAT'S ALL RIGHT,

12:39.106 --> 12:41.325
'CAUSE WHEN WE DO,
HE'LL TALK.

12:41.499 --> 12:43.066
I GUARANTEE IT.

12:53.468 --> 12:55.731
WHAT IS THIS?

12:55.905 --> 12:56.819
YOU'LL SEE.

12:58.299 --> 12:59.735
NO, THIS IS CREEPY.
I'M GETTIN' OUTTA HERE.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.519
Dumain: DON'T BE
AFRAID, BILLIE.

13:01.693 --> 13:03.043
IT'S ME.

13:09.397 --> 13:10.398
OH, MY GOD.

13:11.399 --> 13:14.271
[SIGHS] YOU'RE ALL
GROWN UP NOW, AREN'T YOU?

13:14.445 --> 13:15.882
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?

13:16.056 --> 13:17.797
ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE
HERE, BILLIE.

13:17.971 --> 13:19.407
THAT'S WHY I COME HERE.

13:19.581 --> 13:21.061
FOR GUIDANCE.
FOR HIM.

13:21.235 --> 13:23.411
BUT...HE'S
NOT REAL...IS HE?

13:23.585 --> 13:24.978
I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN REAL, BILLIE.

13:25.152 --> 13:28.068
JUST LIKE I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN THERE FOR YOU BOTH.

13:28.242 --> 13:30.070
I WASN'T JUST
AN IMAGINARY FRIEND.

13:30.244 --> 13:31.985
WHO DO YOU THINK
WROTE IN MY DIARY

13:32.159 --> 13:34.248
AND TOLD YOU HOW
TO FIND ME?

13:34.422 --> 13:36.119
HE PREPARED US
FOR EVERYTHING.

13:36.293 --> 13:39.470
I WAS SENT BY THE GREATER POWERS
TO SHOW YOU YOUR DESTINY...

13:39.644 --> 13:41.603
TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT YOUR POWERS WERE

13:41.777 --> 13:43.387
GIVEN TO YOU FOR A REASON--

13:43.561 --> 13:45.389
TO DO GOOD...

13:45.563 --> 13:47.435
AND TO KEEP
WHAT'S BAD IN CHECK.

13:47.609 --> 13:49.524
HMM. SO THIS IS WHERE
YOU GET THAT FROM?

13:49.698 --> 13:50.742
YES. IT IS.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.135
MUCH IS AT STAKE, BILLIE,

13:52.309 --> 13:54.094
AND ONLY YOU AND YOUR
SISTER CAN STOP IT.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.009
THIS IS THE REASON.
THIS IS THE MOMENT WHY

13:56.183 --> 13:57.619
YOU WERE GIFTED
WITH THESE POWERS--

13:57.793 --> 14:00.622
TO SAVE THE FUTURE
FROM THIS.

14:04.060 --> 14:05.714
OF ALL THE PEOPLE
TO BETRAY ME...

14:05.888 --> 14:07.455
I DIDN'T GO BACK
TO BETRAY YOU, WYATT.

14:07.629 --> 14:09.370
I WENT BACK
TO SAVE YOU.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.198
WYATT?

14:11.372 --> 14:14.027
Wyatt: SAVE ME?
HA. FROM WHAT?

14:14.201 --> 14:16.856
IT'S ALL ABOUT POWER.
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

14:17.030 --> 14:20.250
THAT'S WHY I KEEP
THIS...MUSEUM INTACT--

14:20.424 --> 14:22.296
TO REMIND EVERYONE
THE POWER FROM WHICH
I WAS BORN

14:22.470 --> 14:23.863
AND THAT WHICH
I POSSESS.

14:25.734 --> 14:28.302
[GRUNTING]

14:33.089 --> 14:36.223
WYATT. PIPER'S PROGENY.

14:36.397 --> 14:38.965
THAT SAME SWEET LITTLE BOY
YOU ONCE BABY-SAT?

14:39.139 --> 14:40.923
THAT IS WHAT UNCHECKED
POWER WILL BECOME

14:41.097 --> 14:42.446
IN THE FUTURE.

14:42.620 --> 14:46.059
A FUTURE THAT ONLY YOU
AND YOUR SISTER CAN SAVE.

14:47.843 --> 14:49.627
IT IS YOUR DESTINY.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.592
I CAN'T.

14:57.766 --> 14:58.941
BILLIE, WAIT!

15:11.954 --> 15:14.174
WE ARE NOT PLEASED, DUMAIN.

15:17.525 --> 15:20.223
AND WE ARE RUNNING
OUT OF TIME.

15:25.315 --> 15:26.577
THIS WAS YOUR
PLAN, DUMAIN.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.057
YOUCAME TO US.

15:28.231 --> 15:30.755
WE DIDN'T SACRIFICE
OURSELVES, OUR LIVES,

15:31.321 --> 15:32.496
ONLY TO FAIL NOW.

15:32.670 --> 15:34.368
WE HAVEN'T FAILED.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.718
WE JUST UNDERESTIMATED
BILLIE'S CONNECTION
TO THE WITCHES.

15:36.892 --> 15:39.329
IT'S A LOT STRONGER
THAN WE ANTICIPATED.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.853
YOU MEAN STRONGER
THAN YOUANTICIPATED.

15:42.028 --> 15:44.595
FOR 15 YEARS, I'VE
WORKED TIRELESSLY

15:44.769 --> 15:46.554
TO BRING THIS PLAN
TO FRUITION.

15:46.728 --> 15:48.338
WE WILL SUCCEED.

15:48.512 --> 15:51.080
NOT UNLESS WE CAN KILL
THE CHARMED ONES, WE WON'T.

15:51.254 --> 15:53.648
AND BILLIE REMAINS RETICENT.

15:53.822 --> 15:55.258
AS DO THE CHARMED ONES.

15:55.432 --> 15:57.478
THEY, TOO, HESITATE
TO ATTACK FELLOW HUMANS,

15:57.652 --> 15:58.653
AS I KNEW THEY WOULD.

15:58.827 --> 16:00.307
BUT THEY WON'T
HESITATE FOR LONG.

16:00.481 --> 16:03.136
DON'T IGNORE THE GREAT
PROGRESS WE'VE MADE.

16:03.310 --> 16:06.487
WE'VE SUCCESSFULLY
INVERTED MORALITY.

16:06.661 --> 16:08.706
WE'VE CONVINCED BOTH
CHRISTY AND BILLIE THAT

16:08.880 --> 16:10.230
THE CHARMED ONES
ARE THE EVIL ONES.

16:10.404 --> 16:11.579
WHICH DOES US NO GOOD

16:11.753 --> 16:13.711
UNLESS BILLIE IS ABLE
TO KILL THEM.

16:13.885 --> 16:17.237
AND IF SHE CAN'T,
THE BALANCE OF POWER
WON'T SHIFT...

16:17.411 --> 16:19.630
AND WE WON'T HAVE
THE POWER TO RETURN.

16:19.804 --> 16:23.765
WHICH MEANS...YOU WON'T
BECOME ONE OF US.

16:25.027 --> 16:27.247
HAVE FAITH, MY LORDS.

16:27.421 --> 16:29.466
ONCE BILLIE
IS FULLY TURNED

16:29.640 --> 16:32.078
AND BELIEVE ME,
SHE'S CLOSE--
WAIT.

16:32.252 --> 16:34.994
SOMEONE IS COMING.

OH, ME ACHIN' BACK.

THOUGH...

STRONG-ARM ME

16:53.229 --> 16:55.275
TO BEIN' THEIR
LACKEY AGAIN.

AIEE, FOR THE LOVE
OF ST. ANDREW,

17:06.286 --> 17:09.463
LET'S JUST GET THIS
OVER WITH, SHALL WE?

17:11.204 --> 17:13.684
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO? TAKE A PHOTO?

17:13.858 --> 17:17.123
NO. I'M IDENTIFYIN'
THE THREAT, LIKE SHE
ASKED US TO.

17:17.297 --> 17:18.646
DO YOU HAVE
A BETTER IDEA?

17:18.820 --> 17:22.258
[SNORTS] AND YOU CALL
YOURSELF A LEPRECHAUN.

17:22.432 --> 17:24.652
GO N-EIRI AN BOTHAR LEAT.

17:24.826 --> 17:27.133

17:31.615 --> 17:33.443
[SCREAMING]

17:39.406 --> 17:41.582
LEAVE IT! WE'LL FIND
ANOTHER WAY BACK!

17:41.756 --> 17:43.758
CURSE THOSE CHARMED ONES!

17:43.932 --> 17:45.542
LIKE LAMBS TO SLAUGHTER,
WE ARE.

17:52.984 --> 17:54.812
WE MAY HAVE JUST
FOUND A WAY

17:54.986 --> 17:57.032
TO HELP BILLIE CROSS
THE FINAL THRESHOLD.

17:59.556 --> 18:01.993
SHE MAY NOT BELIEVE
THE CHARMED ONES ARE EVIL
FROM US,

18:02.168 --> 18:04.344
BUT SHE'LL BELIEVE IT
FROM THEM.

18:04.518 --> 18:05.954
Triad Spirit:
AGREED.

18:06.128 --> 18:07.129
SUMMON CREO.

18:07.303 --> 18:08.217
CREO.

18:11.481 --> 18:14.049
AT YOUR SERVICE,
MY LORD.

18:20.011 --> 18:21.622
LOOK. MAYBE BECAUSE
YOU'VE NEVER HAD FRIENDS.

18:21.796 --> 18:22.971
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE FOR ME.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.147
I HAVE DUMAIN,
AND I TRUST HIM.

18:25.321 --> 18:27.280
CAN YOU HONESTLY SAY
THAT ABOUT THE SISTERS?

18:27.454 --> 18:29.456
AFTER THEY'VE PUT
THEIR NEEDS ABOVE YOURS

18:29.630 --> 18:31.240
EVERY SINGLE CHANCE
THEY'VE GOT?

18:31.414 --> 18:33.416
LOOK. I ADMIT THEY'VE
BECOME A LITTLE SELFISH,

18:33.590 --> 18:34.852
BUT THEY HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING BAD ENOUGH

18:35.026 --> 18:36.332
TO DESERVE TO DIE FOR IT.

18:36.506 --> 18:37.464
BUT, BILLIE, THEY WILL.

18:37.638 --> 18:38.987
AND THEN IT'LL BE TOO LATE.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.075
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

18:40.249 --> 18:41.381
YOU SAW THEIR
INNER TRUTHS--

18:41.555 --> 18:43.644
HOW THEY'RE BEING
CORRUPTED BY POWER.

18:43.818 --> 18:45.080
IT'S OUR DESTINY--

18:45.254 --> 18:47.474
OH, I'M SO SICK OF
THIS DESTINY CRAP.

NO! UHH!

19:01.270 --> 19:02.706
UHH!

19:04.578 --> 19:05.535
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

19:07.363 --> 19:08.712
WAIT.

19:08.886 --> 19:10.061
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD USE HIM

19:10.236 --> 19:12.063
TO SEND A MESSAGE
TO THE OTHER DEMONS.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.109
GOOD IDEA.

19:17.243 --> 19:19.593
ANY MORE OF YOUR DEMONS
COME HERE AND ATTACK
OUR FRIENDS, THEY'RE DEAD.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.377
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

19:30.212 --> 19:31.257
ARE YOU OK?

19:31.431 --> 19:33.128
YEAH, SURE.

19:33.302 --> 19:34.782
THANKS TO YOU.

19:34.956 --> 19:37.132
WELL, YOU GUYS
CAN COME OUT NOW.
IT'S SAFE.

19:39.265 --> 19:40.831
DON'T WORRY.
WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS.

19:44.574 --> 19:47.229
WELL, YOU NEVER REALLY
KNOW FOR SURE, THESE DAYS.

19:47.403 --> 19:48.317
WHAT WERE YOU
DOING HERE, ANYWAY?

19:48.491 --> 19:49.884
WHY DID YOU RISK
COMING HERE?

19:51.668 --> 19:53.235
WE WERE...SENT.

19:53.409 --> 19:55.237
REALLY.
BY WHOM?

19:58.414 --> 19:59.633
THE CHARMED ONES.

20:06.509 --> 20:08.511
PAIGE HASN'T HEARD
FROM THE LEPRECHAUNS.

20:08.685 --> 20:10.426
WHICH IS NOT A GOOD SIGN.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.298
I JUST HOPE
WE DIDN'T CONFIRM

20:12.472 --> 20:14.822
THE MYSTERY POWER'S
EXISTENCE
AT THEIR EXPENSE.

20:14.996 --> 20:16.084
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE

20:16.258 --> 20:17.825
A BAD THING, WHICH
ALSO MEANS THAT

20:17.999 --> 20:19.348
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME,
LOOKING FOR IT.

20:19.522 --> 20:21.176
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

20:21.350 --> 20:23.265
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THAT
THE ULTIMATE POWER'S POWER

20:23.439 --> 20:24.745
IS TO DRIVE US CRAZY.

20:24.919 --> 20:26.573
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO FACE

20:26.747 --> 20:28.618
SOME HARSH REALITIES
SOON, PHOEBE.

20:29.924 --> 20:31.273
WE MAY JUST HAVE TO--

20:31.447 --> 20:33.580
UH! DON'T SAY
THE K-WORD.

20:33.754 --> 20:35.103
DO NOT SAY THE K-WORD,

20:35.277 --> 20:36.800
IN REGARDS TO BILLIE
AND CHRISTY, PLEASE.

20:36.974 --> 20:38.541
OK. WELL, JUST BECAUSE
YOU DON'T WANNA SAY IT

20:38.715 --> 20:40.282
DOESN'T MEAN WE WON'T
HAVE TO DO IT.

20:40.456 --> 20:42.023
[SIGHS] O-OK.

20:42.197 --> 20:44.634
AND PUSH COMES TO SHOVE,
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE
TO DO IT?

20:44.808 --> 20:46.419
YOU'RE ACTUALLY GONNA
BE ABLE TO KILL THEM?

20:46.593 --> 20:47.942
UH, IF IT'S US OR THEM?

20:48.116 --> 20:49.726
ABSOLUTELY.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.989
LOOK, WE'RE NOT
TALKING ABOUT INNOCENCE
HERE, PHOEBE.

20:52.163 --> 20:54.209
AND WHETHER OR NOT
THERE'S A FORCE
BEHIND THEM,

20:54.383 --> 20:56.646
THE TRIAD HAND-PICKED
THEM TO KILL US.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.300
I MEAN, IT'S TIME
TO GET REAL.

20:58.474 --> 21:00.998
THAT'S EVEN MORE REASON
TO AVOID CONFRONTATION

21:01.172 --> 21:02.522
AND FIGURE OUT
WHO'S BEHIND THEM.

21:02.696 --> 21:03.523
[THUD]

21:03.697 --> 21:04.828
OH.

21:05.002 --> 21:06.395
WHICH I THINK
I MAY HAVE JUST DONE.

21:06.569 --> 21:07.570
YOU FOUND THE DEMON?

21:07.744 --> 21:10.486
I THINK SO. OK.
I'LL GET PAIGE.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.358
WE'LL USE
YOUR TRUTH POTION

21:12.532 --> 21:13.968
TO PRY A NAME OUT OF THEM,
AND YOU STAY HERE

21:14.142 --> 21:16.100
TO FIGURE OUT
IF THE LEPRECHAUNS
ARE COMIN' BACK.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.625
BUT WHAT IF THEY DON'T?
WHAT IF SOMETHING...

21:20.322 --> 21:21.323
HAPPENED TO THEM?

21:22.933 --> 21:24.674
Liam: I'M SURE
I WAS A GONER.

21:24.848 --> 21:27.068
[SIGHS] GUESS
THAT'S WHY I'M
A LITTLE SHAKEN UP.

21:27.242 --> 21:29.984
DON'T WORRY.
YOU'RE SAFE NOW. I PROMISE.

21:30.158 --> 21:31.246
I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHY

21:31.420 --> 21:32.465
THE DEMONS
KEEP COMING BACK.

21:32.639 --> 21:34.293
I THOUGHT WE'D
KILLED ALL OF THEM.

21:34.467 --> 21:36.207
THERE. GOOD AS NEW.

21:36.382 --> 21:37.992
I THANK YOU FOR THAT.

21:38.166 --> 21:40.124
[CHUCKLES]
AND FOR SAVIN' US.

21:40.299 --> 21:43.476
[CHUCKLES] JUST ONE
THING I CAN'T FIGURE.

21:43.650 --> 21:45.086
YOU FOLKS ARE GOOD.

21:46.435 --> 21:48.959
SO WHY DID
THE CHARMED ONES
SEND US HERE?

21:49.133 --> 21:51.571
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE STILL
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

21:51.745 --> 21:53.616
WHAT DID THEY
SAY THEY WANTED
YOU TO DO?

21:53.790 --> 21:56.750
IT WAS TO FIND
A GREAT EVIL.

21:56.924 --> 21:58.404
THEY CALLED IT
"THE ULTIMATE POWER."

21:58.578 --> 21:59.753
HUH.

22:01.058 --> 22:02.495
AND THEY SAID
IT WAS EVIL?

22:02.669 --> 22:03.757
WHAT ELSE
DID THEY TELL YOU?

22:03.931 --> 22:05.367
THAT THE POWER
WAS HUGE...

22:05.541 --> 22:07.848
AND THAT THEY WERE
BENT ON STOPPING IT.

22:08.022 --> 22:09.371
REALLY.

22:09.545 --> 22:11.591
AND HOW DID THEY PLAN
ON DOING THAT?

22:11.765 --> 22:13.984
SAME AS THEY DEAL
WITH ALL EVIL,
I SUPPOSE--

22:14.158 --> 22:15.159
VANQUISH IT.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.683
IS THAT
WHAT THEY SAID?

22:16.857 --> 22:18.815
THAT THEY WERE GONNA
VANQUISH THE ULTIMATE POWER?

22:18.989 --> 22:20.382
ARE YOU SURE?

22:20.556 --> 22:21.557
WELL, THEY DIDN'T
ACTUALLY SAY THAT.

22:23.037 --> 22:24.821
BUT THAT'S
WHAT THEY DO.
ISN'T IT?

22:24.995 --> 22:27.128
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHY THEY WOULD SEND
YOU GUYS HERE

22:27.302 --> 22:28.477
TO DO
THEIR DIRTY WORK.

22:28.651 --> 22:30.044
[SNICKERS]HAVE THEY DONE
THIS BEFORE?

22:30.218 --> 22:32.263
ALL THE TIME.

22:32.438 --> 22:34.048
IT'S NOT JUST US.

22:34.222 --> 22:36.355
THEY USE THE WHOLE
MAGICAL COMMUNITY.

22:36.529 --> 22:38.531
YET...THEY NEVER
TOOK THE TIME

22:38.705 --> 22:40.228
TO SAVE MAGIC SCHOOL
FROM DEMONS?

22:40.402 --> 22:42.186
COULDN'T BREAK
A NAIL, I GUESS.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.014
CANNON FODDER--

22:44.188 --> 22:46.234
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE
BECOME TO 'EM.

22:47.540 --> 22:48.584
NOWDO YOU BELIEVE

22:48.758 --> 22:49.977
EVERYTHING I'VE
BEEN TELLING YOU?

23:00.988 --> 23:02.816
WE GIVE UP EVERYTHING
FOR THEM...

23:02.990 --> 23:05.427
AND THIS IS
THE THANKS WE GET?

23:05.601 --> 23:08.604
WHAT DOES DUMAIN
THINK WE ARE--
LACKEYS?

23:08.778 --> 23:11.390
WE'VE HAD
THIS CONVERSATION.

23:11.564 --> 23:13.435
IT'S ALL PART
OF THE TRIAD'S PLAN.

23:13.609 --> 23:15.132
WE'LL GET
WHAT WE DESERVE
SOON ENOUGH.

23:15.306 --> 23:16.743
YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT YOU KEEP SAYING.

23:16.917 --> 23:18.658
BUT I'M STILL SLEEPIN'
BEHIND A DUMPSTER.

23:18.832 --> 23:20.181
WE DO AS WE'RE TOLD...

23:20.355 --> 23:22.139
EVEN IF WE HAVE TO MAKE
THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE.

23:22.313 --> 23:25.055
IT'S ALL PART
OF THE GREATER VICTORY.YEAH.

23:25.229 --> 23:27.275
BUT IF WE'RE
NOT A PART OF IT...

23:27.449 --> 23:29.146
I'M NOT SACRIFICING
ANYTHING.

23:29.320 --> 23:31.148
YOU SIGNED AN OATH...
IN BLOOD.

23:31.322 --> 23:33.890
WE BOTH DID. AND IF
YOU DON'T PROTECT THEM,

23:34.064 --> 23:36.023
YOU'LL FACE A FATE
MUCH WORTH THAN DEATH.

23:36.197 --> 23:37.981
FUNNY YOU
SHOULD SAY THAT.

23:39.026 --> 23:41.637
DEMONS.

23:41.811 --> 23:43.160
[GRUNTING]

23:47.208 --> 23:48.949
WE HAVE
A FEW QUESTIONS
FOR YOU.

23:54.128 --> 23:55.869
GENTLEMEN,
WHO IS THE WIZARD
BEHIND THE CURTAIN?

23:56.043 --> 23:56.957
SO TO SPEAK.

23:57.131 --> 23:58.219
THE WHAT?

23:58.393 --> 23:59.960
THE DEMON. WHO ARE
YOU WORKING FOR?

24:01.135 --> 24:02.702
THE DEMON...IS--

24:02.876 --> 24:03.964
NO.

24:04.138 --> 24:05.182
WE CAN'T.

24:05.356 --> 24:07.097
TOO BAD YOU DON'T
HAVE A CHOICE.

24:13.930 --> 24:15.497
AAH!

24:23.766 --> 24:26.639
2 1/2 CORN DOGS?
WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY,
DAD? HE'S 3.

24:26.813 --> 24:28.554
I DON'T CARE
IF HE BEGGED.

24:30.338 --> 24:32.558
LOOK, I GOTTA GO.
BUT SERIOUSLY,

24:32.732 --> 24:34.690
NO MORE JUNK FOOD,
OR HE WILL VOMIT
ON YOU.

24:36.083 --> 24:36.997
WHERE'S THE DEMON?

24:37.171 --> 24:38.999
IN THE WASTELAND,
PROBABLY.

24:39.173 --> 24:41.828
HIM AND HIS PAL
VANQUISHED EACH OTHER
SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO TALK.

24:42.002 --> 24:43.786
THEY SACRIFICED
THEMSELVES?
YEP.

24:43.960 --> 24:45.135
SCARY, HUH?

24:45.309 --> 24:47.137
ANY WORD FROM OUR
LITTLE GREEN FRIENDS?

24:47.311 --> 24:48.443
NO. NOTHING.

24:48.617 --> 24:49.662
I HOPE THEY'RE OK.

24:50.750 --> 24:51.751
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:51.925 --> 24:53.579
I...

24:53.753 --> 24:55.363
AM GOING
TO CALL THEM.

24:56.538 --> 24:58.061
GO N-EIRI
AN BOTHAR LEAT.

25:01.848 --> 25:05.199
WELL! I MIGHT'VE
KNOWN IT WAS YOU,

25:05.373 --> 25:08.028
DROPPIN' US
ON OUR BEHINDS!

25:08.202 --> 25:10.247
YOU'VE NO RIGHT
TO CALL US BACK
LIKE THAT.

25:10.421 --> 25:12.075
WELL, I'M SORRY.
I WAS WORRIED.

25:12.249 --> 25:13.076
ARE YOU OK?

25:13.250 --> 25:14.121
AH. UHH.

25:14.295 --> 25:15.383
NOW YOU'RE WORRIED.

25:15.557 --> 25:17.951
AFTER SENDIN' US
INTO HARM'S WAY.

25:18.125 --> 25:19.996
LOOK, WE WOULDN'T
HAVE DONE IT IF IT
WASN'T IMPORTANT.

25:20.170 --> 25:22.564
YEAH. COME ON, GUYS,
WE'RE TRYIN' TO SAVE
THE FUTURE HERE.

25:22.738 --> 25:23.913
SO YOU SAY.

25:24.087 --> 25:26.350
I'LL BE TAKIN' THAT
BACK NOW, THANK YOU.

25:26.525 --> 25:27.743
HEY, WHAT
ARE YOU DOIN'?

25:27.917 --> 25:30.224
WE'RE NO LONGER
AT YOUR BECK AND CALL.

25:30.398 --> 25:31.660
HMM.

25:31.834 --> 25:32.966
GO N-EIRI
AND BOTHER LEAT!

25:33.140 --> 25:34.141
THAT WAS A GIFT.

25:34.315 --> 25:37.100
AND DON'T
BOTHER CALLIN'.

25:40.408 --> 25:42.497
OOH. WOW.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEM?

25:42.671 --> 25:44.586
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IT'S NOT GOOD.

25:45.935 --> 25:47.546
[SIGHS]

25:47.720 --> 25:50.200
OK, I KNOW LEPRECHAUNS
ARE CRABBY, BUT THIS
IS DIFFERENT.

25:50.374 --> 25:52.768
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU
THINK BILLIE AND CHRISTY
GOT TO THEM SOMEHOW?

25:52.942 --> 25:55.336
OR MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE DID.

25:55.510 --> 25:57.381
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY TURNED ON US
LIKE THAT.

25:57.556 --> 25:58.600
I MEAN, WHAT
DID WEDO?

25:58.774 --> 26:00.646
MAYBE IT'S NOT
ANYTHING WE DID.

26:00.820 --> 26:02.604
MAYBE IT'S
SOMETHING BILLIE
AND CHRISTY DID.

26:02.778 --> 26:03.997
OR WHOEVER'S
BEHIND IT.

26:04.171 --> 26:05.302
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?I'M SAYING

26:05.476 --> 26:07.174
I THINK THEY DID
TO THE LEPRECHAUNS

26:07.348 --> 26:08.784
WHAT THE TRIAD
DID TO THEM.

26:08.958 --> 26:10.046
TURNED THEM AGAINST US?

26:10.220 --> 26:11.787
TWIST EVERYTHING
AROUND

26:11.961 --> 26:13.528
AND MAKE US LOOK
LIKE THE BAD GUYS.

26:13.702 --> 26:16.009
THAT'S CRAZY. THEY
WOULD NEVER BELIEVE THAT.

26:16.183 --> 26:17.924
SURE, THEY WOULD.
THINK ABOUT
OUR TRACK RECORD

26:18.098 --> 26:19.578
WITH THEM LATELY.

26:19.752 --> 26:21.492
BUT WHAT PURPOSE
WOULD THAT SERVE?
WHY EVEN BOTHER?

26:21.667 --> 26:23.669
I DON'T KNOW.
TO ISOLATE US,
MAKE SURE WE HAVE

26:23.843 --> 26:26.062
A LITTLE LESS
BACKUP IN OUR TIME
OF NEED.

26:26.236 --> 26:27.542
YOU MEAN WHEN THEY ATTACK.

26:27.716 --> 26:30.110
MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT THEY'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR.

26:30.284 --> 26:32.068
WELL, WE HAVE TO WARN
THE MAGICAL COMMUNITY

26:32.242 --> 26:33.287
AND TELL 'EM NOT
TO FALL FOR IT.

26:33.461 --> 26:34.636
WHERE'S THAT LIST?

26:34.810 --> 26:36.420
UPSTAIRS. I'LL GET IT.NO, I'LL GET IT.

26:36.595 --> 26:37.726
YOU GO TALK TO COOP
AND MAKE SURE
THEY DON'T

26:37.900 --> 26:39.510
TRY TO TURN
ANYBODY ELSE
AGAINST US.

26:39.685 --> 26:42.818
AND I'M GOING TO TALK
TO OUR LITTLE FRIENDS AGAIN.

26:42.992 --> 26:45.516
WELL, I THINK THAT'S
KIND OF A WASTE OF TIME.

26:45.691 --> 26:48.128
I DON'T THINK SO. I'M
NOT LETTING 'EM OFF
THE HOOK THAT EASILY.

26:49.738 --> 26:51.261
WE'RE ALMOST THERE,
MY LORDS.

26:53.046 --> 26:54.003
ALMOST?

26:55.962 --> 26:57.224
THE LONGER IT TAKES,

26:57.398 --> 26:59.008
THE GREATER THE CHANCE
YOU'LL REGAIN SYMPATHY

26:59.182 --> 27:00.531
FOR THE CHARMED ONES...

27:00.706 --> 27:03.360
WHICH WE ALREADY
KNOW BILLIE
IS PRONE TO DO.

27:03.534 --> 27:05.014
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN,

27:05.188 --> 27:06.712
ESPECIALLY NOW
THAT SHE BELIEVES

27:06.886 --> 27:08.757
THE LEPRECHAUNS WERE
SET UP BY THE CHARMED ONES.

27:08.931 --> 27:10.324
THEN WHAT'S
THE DELAY?

27:10.498 --> 27:12.239
EITHER SHE'S
READY TO KILL THEM,
OR SHE'S NOT.

27:12.413 --> 27:15.198
SHE'S CLOSE. SHE
JUST NEEDS...A LITTLE
MORE CONVINCING.

27:15.372 --> 27:17.026
ONCE SHE THINKS
THE CHARMED ONES

27:17.200 --> 27:19.333
HAVE TURNED THEIR BACKS
ON THE ENTIRE MAGICAL
COMMUNITY...

27:19.507 --> 27:20.813
WELL,
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

27:20.987 --> 27:22.728
THE COMMUNITY'S
TOO VAST...
AND TOO LOYAL

27:22.902 --> 27:24.207
TO THE SISTERS
FOR ALL THEIR YEARS
OF PROTECTING THEM.

27:24.381 --> 27:26.296
WHICH IS WHY WE NEED
TO CREATE A SITUATION

27:26.470 --> 27:27.863
WHERE THEY WON'T BE
THERE TO PROTECT THEM.

27:28.037 --> 27:29.299
HOW?

27:29.473 --> 27:31.519
SIMPLE. WE DISTRACT
THE CHARMED ONES

27:31.693 --> 27:33.564
WHEN THE MAGICAL BEINGS
NEED THEM MOST...

27:33.739 --> 27:35.175
USING THE SAME
DISTRACTIONS

27:35.349 --> 27:37.351
THAT HAVE WORKED
ON THEM IN THE PAST.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.050
BILLIE HERSELF
HAS PROVIDED US

27:41.224 --> 27:42.573
WITH ALL WE NEED
TO KNOW.

27:44.445 --> 27:48.492
AH. THE WITCH DOCTOR
WHO TURNED INNER TRUTH
INTO OBSESSION.

27:48.667 --> 27:51.408
THAT SHOULD WORK
QUITE NICELY ON PAIGE.

27:53.454 --> 27:56.022
SHOULD BE ENOUGH
FOR THE LOT OF US
TO TOUGH IT OUT.

27:56.196 --> 27:58.851
AYE. IF THINGS GET
AS BAD AS I THINK
THEY'RE GOIN' TO,

27:59.025 --> 28:01.114
NO AMOUNT OF LUCK'LL
BE TOO MUCH.

28:01.288 --> 28:03.203
BATTENIN' DOWN
THE HATCHES, WE ARE.

28:08.208 --> 28:10.645
NOW, WHAT DO YA THINK
YOU'RE DOIN' HERE?

28:10.819 --> 28:12.473
YOU'RE NO LONGER
WELCOME HERE.

28:12.647 --> 28:14.780
THAT IS EXACTLY
THE KIND OF ATTITUDE

28:14.954 --> 28:16.564
THAT I AM HERE
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

28:16.738 --> 28:18.218
OURATTITUDE.

28:18.392 --> 28:20.786
WELL, IT'S YOURATTITUDE
THAT'S IN QUESTION HERE.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.440
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHO HAS GOTTEN TO YOU,

28:23.614 --> 28:25.094
BUT CONTRARY
TO POPULAR BELIEF,

28:25.268 --> 28:27.140
WE ARE STILL
THE GOOD GUYS. OK?

28:27.314 --> 28:29.446
AND THE FACT THAT YOU
GUYS HAVE GONE DEMON-
FREE FOR ALL THESE YEARS

28:29.620 --> 28:31.057
PRETTY MUCH
PROVES THAT POINT.

28:31.231 --> 28:33.494
STILL...
THINGS CHANGE.

28:33.668 --> 28:36.976
PEOPLE CHANGE,
ESPECIALLY HUMAN PEOPLE.

28:37.150 --> 28:38.325
SAME DIFFERENCE.

28:38.499 --> 28:39.674
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

28:39.848 --> 28:41.589
WHAT I KNOW IS THAT
THIS IS NOT THE TIME

28:41.763 --> 28:43.460
TO BAIL ON US
JUST BECAUSE WE'VE
HAD OUR DIFFERENCES

28:43.634 --> 28:46.550
OR BECAUSE SOMEONE
HAS BEEN WHISPERING
IN YOUR EAR.
