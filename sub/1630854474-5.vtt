WEBVTT

01:35.762 --> 01:37.055
Sophie.

01:43.854 --> 01:45.314
Jairo, what's up, man?

01:48.192 --> 01:49.443
Hey, Maria Eugenia!

01:49.443 --> 01:50.569
Hello, Javier, how are you?

01:50.569 --> 01:52.279
I saw your husband with another woman.
-Ah.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.405
Watch out.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.032
Javier, how are you?

01:55.699 --> 01:56.617
Look what I brought you.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.036
Let's see, what do you have in there?

01:59.036 --> 02:01.288
Well, look at this beauty.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.165
That's a good looking fish.

02:40.577 --> 02:41.578
Enjoy.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.909
So much meat and me on a diet.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.869
Quit teasing, girls.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.091
You taking care of her?

04:18.841 --> 04:19.760
She looks horrible.

04:28.644 --> 04:29.811
It's okay.

04:31.855 --> 04:32.940
Apologies.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.317
I meant to be here when you first arrived.

04:35.317 --> 04:36.735
I came as soon as I could.

04:43.158 --> 04:44.284
Called payara.

04:46.036 --> 04:48.497
Ugly, but it's delicious.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.541
And the locals know how to make it.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.419
Anyway.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.046
I'm Tommy.

04:56.046 --> 05:00.133
I'm Venezuelan, obviously,
but I was educated in the US. Georgetown.

05:02.636 --> 05:03.637
Do you know if--

05:05.973 --> 05:08.058
Do you know if my husband is alive?

05:10.060 --> 05:14.147
Good question.
And feel free to ask me anything you want.

05:15.899 --> 05:16.900
Okay?

05:24.074 --> 05:26.577
But about that, I don't know.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.246
Should eat. It's always good advice.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.169
How long will I be here?

05:36.211 --> 05:37.212
I don't know.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.380
Different department.

05:39.590 --> 05:43.760
Sorry, I'm just a bureaucrat
with limited vision.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.928
Not a very glamorous job.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.182
But you?

05:48.974 --> 05:50.684
One of your employers is the CIA.

05:51.476 --> 05:52.644
No.
-No?

05:56.899 --> 05:59.193
It's a mistake, this file?

05:59.193 --> 06:00.694
If that's what it says, yeah.

06:03.322 --> 06:05.741
Well, I can't change
what the file says, but...

06:07.367 --> 06:10.954
I can write a new file that goes on top,
becomes the current file.

06:12.956 --> 06:15.459
So, tell me about yourself.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.548
I'm a scientist.

06:22.216 --> 06:23.133
Peer-reviewed.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.469
You can look it up online.

06:27.179 --> 06:32.059
And I was picked up collecting
plant samples to study tribal medicine.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.477
I do addiction research.

06:35.521 --> 06:40.025
And there was a giant mix-up
over the fact that I had a GPS beacon

06:40.025 --> 06:41.276
in my stuff.

06:41.276 --> 06:44.655
Not any GPS beacon. Army issued.

06:45.239 --> 06:46.240
Right.

06:46.740 --> 06:50.077
My husband's in the military.
So is my brother.

06:52.120 --> 06:55.499
I mean, you should see our house.
It's like a fucking armory.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.919
Well, you know, Amber, to be fair,

06:58.919 --> 07:02.589
there was a great deal
of hardware unleashed to save someone.

07:02.589 --> 07:07.344
And don't take offense,
someone who's only a scientist.

07:08.053 --> 07:09.054
No.

07:09.972 --> 07:11.098
You're conflating facts.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.307
Please.

07:12.307 --> 07:15.185
My brother is like a legend
in Special Forces.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.604
My husband's very fucking powerful.

07:18.105 --> 07:21.316
So, they have the means
and the resources to mount a rescue.

07:22.734 --> 07:23.902
That's not a bad thing.

07:24.653 --> 07:26.822
Is it-- Is it bad that they love me?

07:26.822 --> 07:28.156
No.

07:28.156 --> 07:32.911
No, but the other view would be
that your family members

07:32.911 --> 07:36.748
with the security clearances
make you very trustworthy.

07:37.499 --> 07:43.255
So, your family loves you, sure,
but the CIA could love you too, no?

07:48.927 --> 07:52.264
I have friends at Langley,
believe it or not, from my college days.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.308
I know how it works.

07:56.894 --> 07:58.103
I used to be a writer.

07:58.896 --> 07:59.938
I was pretty good.

08:00.564 --> 08:02.149
Then I went into national security,

08:02.149 --> 08:04.318
and for a while there,
I was actually doing both.

08:04.902 --> 08:08.322
Writing fiction during the week
and gathering intelligence on the weekend.

08:08.322 --> 08:10.741
Just like you. Two lives.

08:11.742 --> 08:14.870
So, I feel like I understand you.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.497
Where is this going?

08:18.707 --> 08:19.708
Honestly?

08:21.084 --> 08:23.712
You'd probably die here.

08:26.757 --> 08:28.175
I'm just checking boxes.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.932
And now we're both just here,
in-- in this scenario,

08:34.932 --> 08:37.476
and I wanna have a good relationship
with you.

08:37.476 --> 08:38.559
I want that too.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.813
Good. Great.

08:42.313 --> 08:43.315
Thank you.

08:44.441 --> 08:46.652
There is no reason we cannot be friends.

08:51.448 --> 08:55.285
I'll be back in two or three weeks
to take your statement.

08:55.285 --> 08:58.580
Hey, TomÃ¡s, I have something else
really important to say to you, okay?

09:01.458 --> 09:02.626
What is it?

09:06.588 --> 09:07.589
Fuck you.

09:11.593 --> 09:14.179
Oh, I love it. I really do.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.306
You know,
a normal person would be terrified.

09:16.306 --> 09:20.811
They'd-- You'd be kissing my shoes,
but you're so composed.

09:21.645 --> 09:24.106
You must have had
some great fucking training.

09:24.690 --> 09:26.108
It's my childhood.

09:27.651 --> 09:30.654
When I was little,
there was this rapist guy, right,

09:30.654 --> 09:32.155
who was my mother's boyfriend.

09:32.865 --> 09:37.744
And my brother,
who is probably gonna kill you--

09:38.537 --> 09:43.792
Yeah, anyway, he-he shot this guy
when he was eight.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.672
Just close range, with a hunting rifle,

09:48.672 --> 09:50.382
right in front of my fucking face.

09:50.382 --> 09:54.052
And I think that that event taught me
about fear.

09:54.052 --> 09:58.098
And I acquired this immunity to sadists.

10:04.646 --> 10:07.566
It's like she's still here with me.

10:07.566 --> 10:09.818
I just can't believe it.

10:09.818 --> 10:14.489
In one second, everything changed.

10:16.325 --> 10:19.828
She should be here with us.

10:19.828 --> 10:23.415
I let her down. I didn't take care of her.

10:32.591 --> 10:33.842
What's going on, Manuel?

10:33.842 --> 10:35.093
Hey.
-Hey.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.929
Ready to head out?
-Yes, boss.

10:36.929 --> 10:39.181
Give me a minute and I'll be right there.
-Okay.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.523
Hello.

10:50.067 --> 10:51.735
You're leaving so soon?

10:51.735 --> 10:55.948
Gotta go to Caracas to report
on the good work being done here.

10:57.366 --> 10:58.700
Especially by you.

11:01.245 --> 11:02.579
Listen.

11:03.622 --> 11:06.583
I want you to know
we are all very sorry about Fami.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.130
Thank you.
-So what?

11:12.714 --> 11:13.966
Are you leaving?

11:13.966 --> 11:14.967
Give it some time.

11:14.967 --> 11:17.261
Stay. Relax.

11:17.261 --> 11:20.514
Drink, eat, you deserve it.
And the fish is...

11:21.974 --> 11:22.808
Okay.

11:22.808 --> 11:23.976
You want to go to Colombia?

11:27.104 --> 11:29.022
No, there's nothing for me there.

11:29.648 --> 11:31.859
Then it's settled.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.944
Take all the time you want, okay?

11:35.112 --> 11:36.280
Hey?

11:36.280 --> 11:37.531
Yes?
-Okay.

11:37.531 --> 11:38.949
All right, then.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.033
Take care.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.174
Put the American on the program.

11:55.174 --> 11:56.842
Will do.
-Keep an eye on her.

11:56.842 --> 11:57.926
You know it, brother.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.178
All right, then. Take care.

13:29.518 --> 13:31.770
<i>Down by the bay</i>

13:32.521 --> 13:34.648
<i>Where the watermelons grow</i>

13:34.648 --> 13:37.276
<i>Back to my home</i>

13:37.276 --> 13:39.111
<i>I dare not go</i>

13:39.111 --> 13:41.738
<i>For if I do</i>

13:41.738 --> 13:43.490
<i>My mother will say</i>

13:44.324 --> 13:47.119
<i>"Have you ever seen a bear
Combing his hair"...</i>

14:48.096 --> 14:50.098
You look like shit.

14:51.517 --> 14:53.685
You should learn how to
dress up a little better.

14:53.685 --> 14:55.437
I ate some bad fish.

14:55.437 --> 14:58.232
But I'm ready to brief you.

14:58.232 --> 14:59.525
Go on, then.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.276
She's marvelous.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.488
My idea is to produce videos with her.

15:04.488 --> 15:06.740
Give a little love to the base.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.909
Love to the base?

15:08.909 --> 15:11.411
What the fuck are you talking about?

15:11.411 --> 15:12.454
More YouTube?

15:13.580 --> 15:14.957
Picture it,

15:14.957 --> 15:17.751
"The damsel they cannot bring home."

15:17.751 --> 15:21.338
It's perfect
because her family is military.

15:21.338 --> 15:25.092
If I can get her to disavow her own blood!

15:25.092 --> 15:27.928
Wow! That shit goes viral.

15:29.096 --> 15:30.806
Fuck.

15:30.806 --> 15:32.182
It's a little obvious, no?

15:32.182 --> 15:34.142
Obvious is good, no?

15:35.018 --> 15:36.895
Makes it clear.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.897
What's clear?

15:38.897 --> 15:39.940
Fuck YouTube.

15:39.940 --> 15:44.236
I asked you to find out what role
she plays in all this.

15:45.737 --> 15:46.738
None.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.159
Maybe she's a subcontractor, I don't know.

15:53.078 --> 15:54.997
You're losing it.

15:54.997 --> 15:58.333
You're either full of shit, or I don't
know what the fuck is wrong with you.

15:58.333 --> 16:03.088
You're coming up with this silly
YouTube video shit.

16:04.423 --> 16:07.926
Fuck, how can I do my job
if you don't trust me?

16:07.926 --> 16:10.971
You want me to trust you?
Take responsibility.

16:10.971 --> 16:13.265
Give it to me.
-Will you take responsibility?

16:13.265 --> 16:16.101
Find that shit out, now.

16:16.101 --> 16:18.854
What the fuck is her role in all this?

16:18.854 --> 16:21.523
Get answers or I'm gonna fuck you!

16:22.983 --> 16:24.234
Okay.

16:24.234 --> 16:25.360
Okay, nothing.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.905
Move your ass and get to work, fuck.

16:31.992 --> 16:32.993
Done.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.112
Get out of here.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.327
I want to get out of here!

17:17.621 --> 17:19.998
You better get out.

17:21.916 --> 17:25.546
Out of here!

17:28.173 --> 17:29.258
Don't come in here.

17:32.803 --> 17:36.640
Do not come in here.
No, no, no. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.062
Hello?

17:43.146 --> 17:44.147
Go away.

17:48.026 --> 17:50.779
Go away.
You're not supposed to be in here.

17:51.655 --> 17:52.739
Hello?

18:10.799 --> 18:11.800
I'm Amber.

18:13.969 --> 18:15.220
This is my room.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.264
Won't you get out of here?

18:18.098 --> 18:19.099
Okay.

18:22.311 --> 18:24.271
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:30.110 --> 18:31.320
What day is it?

18:31.320 --> 18:32.404
I don't know.

18:33.655 --> 18:35.866
Are you trying to confuse me?
-Not at all.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.535
I didn't know you were in here.

18:39.411 --> 18:40.579
The door was unlocked.

18:41.496 --> 18:43.165
What day is it?
-I don't know.

18:44.416 --> 18:46.376
I will not speak to you, in that case.

19:02.559 --> 19:03.393
Are you German?

19:09.191 --> 19:10.567
How long have you been here?

19:16.782 --> 19:17.950
Is that a toothbrush?

19:18.867 --> 19:20.369
You can't have it!

19:31.964 --> 19:33.507
The music is so loud.
-There's no music.

19:33.507 --> 19:35.551
The music is so loud. Too loud!
-There's no music.

19:35.551 --> 19:37.094
Hey, hey! Hey!
-Stop!

19:38.762 --> 19:39.763
Listen.

19:40.597 --> 19:43.809
They turned the music off. It's over.

19:49.815 --> 19:50.816
There was--

19:53.694 --> 19:54.987
There was no music.

19:56.655 --> 19:58.574
So, I-- Now I know you're a liar.

20:02.327 --> 20:03.704
Thank you very much.

20:07.332 --> 20:08.333
Liar.

21:06.517 --> 21:09.728
I would like
to know how 500 million points

21:09.728 --> 21:12.272
of mega data got pushed in four weeks.

21:12.272 --> 21:15.692
I don't know. I do not kn--

21:51.937 --> 21:54.690
Amber, no. What are you doing, Amber?

21:55.691 --> 21:58.026
No, no, no. What are you doing?

21:58.026 --> 22:01.780
This is not right. Not like this.
You use your hamstrings.

22:01.780 --> 22:04.616
I do it like this. You do it like this.

22:07.953 --> 22:11.164
What is your problem?
Why you never talk to me?

22:12.165 --> 22:14.376
I've tried. It's hard.

22:16.879 --> 22:20.090
No, you don't. Not really.
You don't really talk to me.

22:20.883 --> 22:22.676
Not from the heart.

22:26.054 --> 22:27.431
Hey.

22:29.016 --> 22:32.352
Have you ever been diagnosed
with schizophrenia?

22:33.729 --> 22:37.691
You imagine things that aren't real,
like that music, the music playing.

22:37.691 --> 22:40.694
Hallucinations are a feature
of schizophrenia.

22:46.909 --> 22:49.369
Maybe if I'm crazy,
I shouldn't tell you that I'm leaving.

22:49.369 --> 22:51.455
I'm leaving in November.
It's been decided.

22:54.374 --> 22:55.709
And, if you want me to,

22:55.709 --> 22:58.587
I can maybe call your family,
let them know you're here.

23:03.300 --> 23:05.677
You're very fortunate to have me.

23:05.677 --> 23:07.387
Can I ask you a question?

23:08.013 --> 23:09.014
<i>Ja.</i>

23:09.806 --> 23:14.853
Why do you get to move around
wherever you want all by yourself?

23:15.896 --> 23:17.314
They let you go anywhere.

23:18.190 --> 23:19.983
I earn it.
-How?

23:20.692 --> 23:22.027
They love free labor.

23:23.070 --> 23:25.989
If I earn five minutes by myself...

23:27.991 --> 23:29.368
swim across.

23:30.827 --> 23:34.164
You can't escape from here. Never.

23:38.418 --> 23:43.298
You want a tip though?
Don't drink the soup. It's poisoned.

23:44.967 --> 23:45.884
The soup?

23:45.884 --> 23:47.469
Yeah.

24:39.563 --> 24:40.397
Uh-huh.

25:25.984 --> 25:29.112
Do you have a family?

25:29.112 --> 25:30.531
<i>SÃ­.</i>

25:37.538 --> 25:38.997
I got Amber!

25:47.339 --> 25:48.924
Alex!

26:01.687 --> 26:03.856
Just wanted to say thank you.

26:04.439 --> 26:07.901
Will you take this? It's just a gift.

26:16.285 --> 26:17.619
<i>Adios, chicas.</i>

26:44.563 --> 26:45.689
Thank you.

26:46.273 --> 26:48.400
That's not the way to get-- Escape.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.943
You know a better one?

26:51.153 --> 26:55.407
Yeah, I do. But I can't
tell you. They will kill me immediately.

26:55.407 --> 26:58.911
Don't you wanna get out?
-Yeah, I am.

26:58.911 --> 27:00.412
No, you're not.
-Yes, I am.

27:00.412 --> 27:02.122
I am!
-The only way out is with me.

27:02.664 --> 27:03.665
It's with me.

27:17.429 --> 27:18.430
Look.

27:21.642 --> 27:22.768
Okay.

27:41.286 --> 27:44.790
Careful. Careful.

27:50.295 --> 27:51.839
I thought you said it was poisoned.

27:53.131 --> 27:57.094
It is. Nasty drugs.
Who cares? I'm leaving.

27:57.094 --> 27:58.178
Might as well enjoy.

28:01.181 --> 28:02.599
May I have yours?

28:02.599 --> 28:03.851
No.

28:06.436 --> 28:08.689
It's not poisoned. You want my soup.

28:09.731 --> 28:14.820
<i>Nein.</i> Amber, <i>w-- was?</i>

28:19.283 --> 28:20.367
I got you.

28:21.660 --> 28:22.661
I got your number.

28:32.045 --> 28:33.046
It means,

28:34.256 --> 28:38.051
"When you see the gold,
you've found El Dorado."

28:38.051 --> 28:40.220
Let's talk about something that's real.

28:40.220 --> 28:43.015
It's real. It's all around us.

30:09.309 --> 30:10.310
Hey.

30:12.020 --> 30:15.899
Nice to see you. You look nice.

30:16.817 --> 30:19.820
Look, I have-- I have a new theory.

30:20.320 --> 30:21.989
And I-- I think it's pretty good.

30:22.614 --> 30:25.492
Our partners from Russia
and Cuba pulled your travel.

30:26.076 --> 30:27.494
I asked them for help...

30:27.494 --> 30:30.080
...with you
because they have advanced capabilities--

30:30.080 --> 30:31.331
I like to travel.

30:31.999 --> 30:36.628
And they have you
at Kleiner Tiergarten Park.

30:37.462 --> 30:42.801
In Berlin, August 25th, 2019.

30:42.801 --> 30:44.011
What?

30:44.011 --> 30:45.804
Two days before you arrived there,

30:45.804 --> 30:50.267
a Chechen separatist got killed
by a suppressed Glock 26.

30:58.442 --> 30:59.943
You think I killed him.

30:59.943 --> 31:02.863
Of course you didn't kill him, Amber.

31:02.863 --> 31:07.034
The FSB killed him.
You were sent in to map the scene.

31:07.534 --> 31:11.955
And that's you, first in.
-I was just a tourist.

31:12.831 --> 31:16.376
There was probably
10,000 tourists there that day.

31:16.376 --> 31:18.587
And that's what you were doing
at the border.

31:18.587 --> 31:22.049
You were mapping our network,
assessing our ties to the villages.

31:22.049 --> 31:26.261
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Tommy. Timmy?

31:26.261 --> 31:27.554
Or is it TomÃ¡s?

31:30.182 --> 31:33.519
Look, I'm your prisoner.
I'll say anything you want.

31:33.519 --> 31:36.647
You can make me say anything you want,
so cut out all this bullshit.

31:36.647 --> 31:38.732
Let's do our tape.
-Okay, okay.

31:39.483 --> 31:44.363
I'm just clearing up the air.
Just giving you my news.

31:44.947 --> 31:47.950
So talk about the School of Americas,

31:47.950 --> 31:50.244
all the assassination bullshit,

31:50.827 --> 31:55.457
and whatever new piece you were
setting up in Venezuela.

31:57.417 --> 32:00.546
And look at me.
Look at me, not the camera.

32:05.759 --> 32:07.553
Tell us why you are here.

32:08.887 --> 32:10.556
My name is Amber Chesborough.

32:11.181 --> 32:13.517
I'm a botanist and a pharmacologist,

32:14.017 --> 32:16.103
and I'm being held
as a prisoner in Venezuela

32:16.103 --> 32:18.856
because they think
that I'm part of the CIA.

32:20.232 --> 32:22.150
Are you fucking with me right now?

32:25.195 --> 32:27.406
Sorry, I just had to get that out there.

32:28.031 --> 32:30.242
Oh, my God. Okay.

32:31.660 --> 32:34.580
Just explain to me
the School of Americas thing.

32:34.580 --> 32:38.083
Like, what e-- what exactly it is,
and if it's related to cocaine,

32:38.083 --> 32:40.210
'cause I wanna say it right.

32:40.210 --> 32:42.004
I'm sorry. I don't know.

32:42.004 --> 32:44.047
I don't know what the CIA
does around here,

32:44.047 --> 32:47.509
and you fucking know that,
you sadistic bastard.

32:56.059 --> 32:59.229
Amber, I'm t-trying to help you.

33:00.397 --> 33:02.608
This is how you and I survive.

33:02.608 --> 33:04.443
Okay, then just tell me what to say.

33:04.443 --> 33:06.236
It doesn't work that--
-Tell me what to say. Give me the line.

33:06.236 --> 33:09.031
It doesn't work that way, okay?

33:17.664 --> 33:19.124
My name is Amber Chesborough.

33:20.667 --> 33:22.377
The daughter of Maggie, an artist.

33:23.795 --> 33:26.173
The sister of Alex, a decorated soldier.

33:27.674 --> 33:30.427
And the wife of Eric Haas,
a decorated soldier.

33:31.094 --> 33:35.891
And I'm being held
against my will in Venezuela.

33:38.435 --> 33:39.436
Unreal.

33:39.436 --> 33:43.232
I surprised you, huh? Huh?

33:47.611 --> 33:51.615
You came to this region to hurt people.
Admit that much.

33:52.324 --> 33:54.576
To punish us until we become like you.

33:55.786 --> 33:59.456
But the truth is that democracy
is dead in North America,

33:59.456 --> 34:01.083
and we don't want to imitate you.

34:01.083 --> 34:04.419
We reject your influence.

34:04.419 --> 34:07.756
Oh, so what,
you fucking corrupt little baby?

34:07.756 --> 34:10.926
But don't get like that, Amber.
I'm talking about the old you.

34:11.760 --> 34:13.929
Now you've changed.
-No, I'm completely the same.

34:13.929 --> 34:15.639
Oh, no, Amber.
-Yeah. Yeah, I am.

34:15.639 --> 34:17.014
Amber, I've seen you.

34:17.014 --> 34:22.521
Now you're making friends here, huh?
Like the people in the cocaine lab.

34:24.356 --> 34:26.525
America should no longer treat Venezuela

34:26.525 --> 34:31.487
as the enemy any more
than we treat ourselves as the enemy.

34:31.487 --> 34:36.577
We're all human beings,
and we deserve equal treatment under God.

34:37.369 --> 34:41.623
We have one good one.
I need ten more like.

34:41.623 --> 34:46.170
America has done awful things
to Venezuela over the years.

34:46.170 --> 34:48.839
Our leaders are flawed. They're capable--
-Okay, that's-- that's good. Good.

34:48.839 --> 34:51.049
Yeah, okay.
-It's generic.

34:51.049 --> 34:52.551
You don't want to talk about the CIA.

34:54.928 --> 34:57.848
It's okay. Fine. So what?

34:59.308 --> 35:02.060
Now we're making a propaganda tape, okay?

35:02.060 --> 35:04.980
So you don't have to believe it.
It's make-believe.

35:05.564 --> 35:07.399
It's for the TV. It's for the Internet.

35:07.399 --> 35:10.235
If my brother sees me trashing the US...

35:10.235 --> 35:14.781
He will understand. He's-- He's not naive.

35:14.781 --> 35:17.868
He has risked his life for this country.

35:17.868 --> 35:19.453
Let's move on.
-I just--

35:19.453 --> 35:24.249
I can't do it to him.
-Amber, let me make this easy for you.

35:24.249 --> 35:26.627
I will move you to the men's prison.

35:31.048 --> 35:34.009
This is the last time
I'm gonna hit record.

35:47.022 --> 35:49.399
My name is Amber Chesborough...

35:53.278 --> 35:56.156
and I'd like to make a statement
about America.

36:01.286 --> 36:03.455
The people that I know

36:04.706 --> 36:08.085
who work for the American government...

36:10.796 --> 36:14.508
believe that they can make
the world a better place.

36:17.678 --> 36:19.805
That's America.

36:22.933 --> 36:28.021
This childish idea
that is worth dying for...

36:29.106 --> 36:31.859
...that we can make
the world a better place.

36:36.321 --> 36:39.867
Despite perhaps the most obvious evidence.

36:51.795 --> 36:53.255
I'm going to grab some air.

36:54.298 --> 36:56.842
When I come back, we're gonna do it again.

37:44.723 --> 37:47.100
I'm not allowed more
than three pumps of soap.

37:48.560 --> 37:50.771
I fake most of my orgasms.

37:51.313 --> 37:54.358
I want to rip out
the cat's whiskers sometimes.

37:57.069 --> 38:01.198
I have been having super psychotic dreams.

38:03.700 --> 38:05.702
I don't like the look of raisins.

38:07.037 --> 38:11.750
I never knew my father.
He-he left when I was little.

38:11.750 --> 38:14.419
And I heard from my brother
that he's a good dancer.

38:15.587 --> 38:16.922
My father was wonderful.

38:17.881 --> 38:20.259
My mother was the devil.
She prepared me for espionage.

38:22.219 --> 38:24.763
My rich husband hates me.

38:26.014 --> 38:27.015
He's so angry with me,

38:27.015 --> 38:29.560
and that's why he's gonna leave me
in here to die.

38:30.936 --> 38:32.479
That's absurd.

38:33.814 --> 38:36.316
When I get out, I'll call them
and let them know you're here.

38:36.316 --> 38:38.151
He's gonna come here immediately.

38:40.320 --> 38:41.572
I can't hear God anymore.

38:41.572 --> 38:43.949
I keep trying to remember
what he sounds like.

38:43.949 --> 38:47.411
God sounds like flapping wings.
My husband hates me.

38:48.537 --> 38:50.163
He's gonna leave me here because...

38:52.249 --> 38:53.333
I lied to him.

38:55.252 --> 38:58.630
I don't think your husband
would abandon someone so pretty.

38:58.630 --> 39:01.091
You're so pretty.
Is that why he married you?

39:03.427 --> 39:08.015
No. It was to prove something to himself,
that he wasn't his father, you know?

39:08.015 --> 39:10.392
But I shouldn't talk--
-But he kept you safe. He kept you safe.

39:10.392 --> 39:12.060
But he looked down on me...

39:13.645 --> 39:14.646
secretly.

39:19.151 --> 39:20.152
If I'm honest...

39:23.530 --> 39:24.531
I never loved him.

39:30.245 --> 39:32.581
Okay. I don't believe that.

39:36.960 --> 39:38.462
I don't wanna play this anymore.

39:39.838 --> 39:44.218
Oh, no, no. I'm not finished.
I'm not finished.

39:46.720 --> 39:49.640
You refuse to believe
that the person you love lied to you.

39:50.182 --> 39:51.600
It's too shocking a discovery,

39:51.600 --> 39:54.478
so you cover the trauma
with rationalizations

39:54.478 --> 39:56.230
that the whole marriage
was a kind of fraud.

39:56.230 --> 39:57.231
But you loved him.

39:57.231 --> 40:00.359
No, I just said that I do not love him.
I just said that.

40:00.359 --> 40:02.152
You're lying to yourself.

40:02.152 --> 40:04.780
Forget about me,
but why is Amber lying to Amber?

40:04.780 --> 40:09.618
No. I'm not taking therapy
from somebody who's mentally ill.

40:12.829 --> 40:14.373
What if I am? So?

40:16.500 --> 40:18.836
I'm still a lot smarter than you, Amber.

40:19.711 --> 40:24.299
And I received training
at the BND in personality analysis.

40:25.634 --> 40:28.303
It's a lot harder than studying plants.

40:58.125 --> 41:00.460
I see you, my friend. I see you.

41:06.592 --> 41:08.844
Hey. Did you sleep?

41:10.262 --> 41:11.471
No.

41:12.181 --> 41:13.891
Life is good. And the work's good.

41:13.891 --> 41:14.975
Stay there.

41:15.976 --> 41:17.686
Amberline, where would I go?

41:25.944 --> 41:30.157
You said you had a plan to escape.
What is it?

41:30.157 --> 41:32.284
What do I do? Like, where do I go?

41:33.452 --> 41:36.246
Hey, they-- they cannot understand you.
They don't speak any English.

41:36.246 --> 41:38.999
Hey, Fabiola, do you speak English? No.

41:38.999 --> 41:41.543
What about you, Maria?
Do you speak English? No.

41:41.543 --> 41:44.421
Pedro? No, no, no, no, no, no. No English.

41:44.421 --> 41:47.925
You can escape,
but you will have to kill someone.

41:48.425 --> 41:51.178
And it's obvious to me, Amber,
that you're no killer.

41:52.846 --> 41:55.057
That is the core problem, honestly.

41:55.057 --> 41:57.809
That's what really worries me,
that you're no killer.

42:01.355 --> 42:05.234
Hey. Hey. Tell me.

42:07.819 --> 42:11.740
Behind the helicopter pad,
the guards leave an ATV.

42:12.533 --> 42:16.078
They take it into the jungle,
not to-- to patrol,

42:16.078 --> 42:18.956
but to have sexual adventures.

42:18.956 --> 42:23.752
So you take that ATV, and you-you
take it down the path to the waterfall.

42:23.752 --> 42:28.257
And from there, to the river
that leads to the Amazon.

42:28.257 --> 42:30.968
And then you follow
the current to civilization.

42:31.802 --> 42:32.803
You understand?

42:33.470 --> 42:34.763
Yeah. Yeah.

42:36.682 --> 42:39.434
You can't even kill a guard.
Why are we even talking about this?

42:39.434 --> 42:41.019
Oh, you'd be surprised.

42:41.019 --> 42:43.438
I don't think so. That's why I like you.

42:44.189 --> 42:47.734
You're not innocent at all,
but you're also not bad.

42:48.360 --> 42:54.241
So you're a confused mixture.
That's okay. I like it.

43:36.783 --> 43:40.162
Hildy. Hildy. Hildy.

43:41.914 --> 43:46.502
Hildy, let's go. Let's go.
The hole's ready.

43:46.502 --> 43:48.337
Come on. Come on.

43:49.796 --> 43:52.674
Oh, no, Amberline. I can't leave.

43:54.134 --> 43:55.719
Can't leave.

43:55.719 --> 43:59.097
What? No. Come on.

43:59.806 --> 44:02.309
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

44:21.078 --> 44:22.496
My best friend.

44:36.176 --> 44:37.553
I'm gonna make it.

44:58.073 --> 44:59.074
Oh, my God.

51:05.941 --> 51:07.651
She came this way!

55:36.920 --> 55:37.754
Fuck.

55:49.975 --> 55:52.019
Okay. Okay.

57:47.259 --> 57:51.597
We are in a tough situation.

57:52.598 --> 57:54.725
We're all family here.

57:54.725 --> 57:58.520
Brothers, sisters, friends,
fathers, mothers.

58:00.355 --> 58:01.857
And these women

58:01.857 --> 58:05.110
have been given the same privileges.

58:09.239 --> 58:13.744
The guy by the ATV, you didn't kill him.

58:19.958 --> 58:21.502
Amberline, you'll be okay.

58:23.587 --> 58:25.756
But what did they do? Huh?

58:25.756 --> 58:27.674
They took advantage of it.

58:28.592 --> 58:33.764
Our men were in a dangerous situation.

58:35.557 --> 58:38.101
Risking their lives to find her.

58:46.318 --> 58:48.195
This is a difficult situation.

59:02.835 --> 59:05.170
I don't know what you
want me to do, Amber.

59:05.170 --> 59:11.510
I have 400 people working under me,
and I have to maintain discipline, so...

59:13.637 --> 59:15.347
someone has to be punished.

59:21.645 --> 59:22.855
Okay.

59:34.783 --> 59:36.076
You tell me, Amber.

59:38.829 --> 59:40.581
Shoot me, please. Shoot me.

59:41.540 --> 59:46.044
I did it, I did it. Shoot me. Shoot me.
