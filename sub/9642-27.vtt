00:05.870 --> 00:09.130
Mom and dad are gonna be so surprised
you make dinner for everyone.

00:09.160 --> 00:11.830
I know, but I just hope
it's not too good or they'll

00:11.860 --> 00:14.090
expect me to open a jar of
spaghetti sauce every week.

00:14.130 --> 00:16.129
Alex, I opened that jar.

00:16.160 --> 00:18.940
Harper, nobody likes a braggart.

00:20.910 --> 00:24.950
Uh-oh, Alex is cooking.

00:26.850 --> 00:28.220
She wants something.

00:28.260 --> 00:30.060
Or she did something.

00:30.090 --> 00:31.860
Or she wants us to eat something gross

00:31.890 --> 00:33.930
in front of a hidden camera.

00:36.270 --> 00:40.170
Um... no,
actually I just made

00:40.210 --> 00:41.970
a spaghetti dinner for all of us.

00:42.010 --> 00:45.840
Hey, did you guys know
that pasta goes from this...

00:45.880 --> 00:48.810
...to this, in just eight
minutes in boiling water?

00:48.850 --> 00:51.110
Now that's magic.

00:52.950 --> 00:54.920
I smell garlic cheese bread!

00:54.950 --> 00:57.990
And I know it's not me, 'cause my shirt
just smells like regular cheese bread.

00:58.020 --> 01:00.150
You made garlic cheese bread, too?

01:00.190 --> 01:01.860
Mmm. By accident.

01:01.890 --> 01:03.990
She meant to make pizza
but forgot the sauce.

01:11.870 --> 01:14.200
- Professor Crumbs.
- Professor Crumbs!

01:14.240 --> 01:16.910
That was a dramatic entrance.

01:16.940 --> 01:18.080
It's just something new I'm trying.

01:18.110 --> 01:20.950
I'm still working on
the beard in the face part.

01:22.180 --> 01:25.180
I understand Alex performed a selfless act

01:25.220 --> 01:28.920
- without using magic.
- A selfless act?

01:28.960 --> 01:31.090
All she did was open
a jar of spaghetti sauce

01:31.120 --> 01:35.090
- and make pizza wrong.
- You take what you can get.

01:36.260 --> 01:39.160
We've been waiting
for this for a long time.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.970
You've just completed
your final requirement

01:43.000 --> 01:47.910
enabling all of you to begin
your Family Wizard Competition.

01:47.940 --> 01:50.180
- Hey! That's great!
- All right!

01:50.210 --> 01:52.210
All right. So, Professor Crumbs,

01:52.250 --> 01:54.150
when does it start? I mean,
do I have time to make up for

01:54.180 --> 01:56.110
16 years of hardly paying attention?

01:57.920 --> 01:58.990
I'm happy to announce

01:59.020 --> 02:02.120
that the Russo Family
Competition commences...

02:02.160 --> 02:04.060
...immediately.

02:09.030 --> 02:10.160
What?

02:10.199 --> 02:13.030
Everyone else gets to go to
the Wizard Competition but me?

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

03:24.070 --> 03:28.180
here's your host for tonight's
Family Wizard Competition,

03:28.210 --> 03:31.250
<i>Chancellor Rudy Tootietootie!</i>

03:31.280 --> 03:34.920
Oh, my gosh! The Wizard
Competition is a game show.

03:34.950 --> 03:36.250
I'm really good at game shows.

03:36.290 --> 03:37.990
Especially when it's a rerun.

03:39.860 --> 03:42.790
Thank you!
It's great to be here.

03:42.830 --> 03:45.190
As you know, for centuries
we've been choosing

03:45.230 --> 03:50.030
one sibling from each family
to be a wizard for life,

03:50.070 --> 03:51.870
crushing the dreams of all the others.

03:51.900 --> 03:54.940
It's a fun night, everybody.

03:57.070 --> 04:01.840
Tonight we find out which one
of the Russo's will be...

04:01.880 --> 04:06.850
...the Last Wizard Standing!

04:08.120 --> 04:10.020
I can't believe we're finally here.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.160
This is it.

04:12.190 --> 04:15.030
One of us is going to
become the family wizard.

04:15.060 --> 04:17.160
Indeed. And I
want you to know

04:17.200 --> 04:20.000
that I've become very fond
of all three of you.

04:20.029 --> 04:23.230
So, whatever the outcome, I'll be proud.

04:24.270 --> 04:26.200
Well, which one is it Professor Crumbs?

04:26.240 --> 04:28.140
Are you fond or are you proud?

04:28.170 --> 04:30.940
I'm confused.

04:32.140 --> 04:34.010
Good luck, kids.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.810
Now, I know this is about being a wizard,

04:35.850 --> 04:37.950
but if there's a bonus round,

04:37.980 --> 04:39.810
try to get the washer and dryer.

04:41.120 --> 04:44.020
I need to tell you guys
something before this starts.

04:44.050 --> 04:46.090
Winning the Wizard Competition
is going to be great,

04:46.120 --> 04:47.220
but it comes with a price.

04:47.260 --> 04:48.820
I know where you're going with this.

04:48.860 --> 04:50.160
And, yes, don't even worry about it.

04:50.190 --> 04:53.000
After I win I'll use magic when
you forget Mom's birthday.

04:53.030 --> 04:55.970
No Justin, I'm talking about family.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.970
How often does your
Uncle Kelbo come around?

04:58.000 --> 05:00.800
A couple times a year?
Aunt Megan? Never.

05:00.840 --> 05:02.100
Do you know why?

05:02.140 --> 05:06.740
Because we let the
competition come between us.

05:06.780 --> 05:09.850
Promise you'll stick together no
matter who becomes the Family Wizard.

05:09.880 --> 05:10.980
I promise, Dad.

05:11.020 --> 05:12.080
- I promise.
- I promise.

05:12.120 --> 05:15.190
Not to me. To yourselves.

05:15.220 --> 05:17.850
I promise.

05:17.890 --> 05:18.990
Mm-hmm.

05:21.960 --> 05:23.160
Mr. and Mrs. Russo!

05:23.190 --> 05:25.190
Could you guess who I'm rooting for?

05:26.900 --> 05:30.130
- Can you give us a hint?
- Sure.

05:30.170 --> 05:33.240
Alex!

05:33.270 --> 05:36.210
Mason, you do know that
Justin's going to win.

05:36.240 --> 05:39.840
- Justin?
- Of course!

05:39.880 --> 05:42.210
He's studied the hardest,
he stuck by the rules.

05:42.250 --> 05:44.150
My son hasn't been a stick in the mud

05:44.180 --> 05:45.850
all these years for nothing.

05:45.880 --> 05:48.120
Well, I'm rooting for Alex.

05:48.150 --> 05:50.250
I mean, she defeated
the Angels of Darkness,

05:50.290 --> 05:52.190
saved the world from an asteroid.

05:52.220 --> 05:56.030
Plus, Justin can easily get
a career if he doesn't win.

05:56.060 --> 05:59.860
We'd be stuck with her for life.

06:02.200 --> 06:05.970
OK, people.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.210
It's time to meet tonight's
competitors, the Russo's.

06:09.240 --> 06:11.740
Justin... Alex...

06:11.780 --> 06:14.180
...and the one nobody
thinks is going to win, Max!

06:16.850 --> 06:18.850
He's gonna do great.

06:20.990 --> 06:22.790
Justin Russo.

06:22.820 --> 06:25.920
It's been a long road of
magic training to get here.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.930
Do you think you're ready?

06:28.960 --> 06:31.800
I believe the correct answer
is yes, Justin is ready.

06:34.230 --> 06:36.140
Max, you know that button
is not a microphone,

06:36.170 --> 06:38.040
and we haven't started
the questions yet, right?

06:39.210 --> 06:40.810
The answer to that is uh,

06:40.840 --> 06:43.010
no, I did not know we
did not start the questions.

06:44.980 --> 06:46.880
Um, I would go ahead
and start the Competition,

06:46.910 --> 06:48.150
because he's just gonna do that all night.

06:48.180 --> 06:50.820
I'm going to have to concur
with Alex on this one,

06:50.850 --> 06:52.080
I will be doing this all night.

06:55.820 --> 06:59.160
OK, before we start, just a few rules.

06:59.190 --> 07:03.260
You each have one challenge
and one timeout.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.830
Kind of describes my second marriage.

07:05.860 --> 07:10.000
OK...

07:10.030 --> 07:13.070
Let's find out which Russo will be

07:13.100 --> 07:17.170
the Last Wizard Standing!

07:17.200 --> 07:21.770
Yeah!

07:21.810 --> 07:23.810
OK, round one.

07:23.840 --> 07:26.080
Each correct answer is worth 150 points.

07:26.110 --> 07:27.880
I'll describe the problem,

07:27.910 --> 07:30.120
and you must buzz in
with the magical solution.

07:33.090 --> 07:36.820
"You must go to aid a wizard in
distress on the planet Mars... "

07:36.850 --> 07:39.090
<i>Transportium nextorbitorium.</i>

07:39.120 --> 07:40.860
Correct.

07:42.030 --> 07:44.060
"You need to switch
bodies with someone."

07:44.100 --> 07:47.130
<i>Cambia corporum meum</i>
<i>copora sua nominavi.</i>

07:47.170 --> 07:49.170
Correct again!

07:50.900 --> 07:54.240
It's a Triple Reverse
Bonus worth 250 points.

07:54.270 --> 07:57.040
I'll give you the triple complex spell,

07:57.070 --> 08:00.110
and you must answer with the
correct uses in the correct order.

08:01.810 --> 08:04.780
<i>"Dehydradus-lougaines,</i>
<i>Apus-escapus,</i>

08:04.810 --> 08:05.950
<i>Cashmereus-appearus."</i>

08:07.220 --> 08:08.950
Drain a room filled with water,

08:08.980 --> 08:11.950
transport out of a room,
and make cash appear.

08:11.990 --> 08:14.760
Ah, I'm sorry. Incorrect.

08:14.790 --> 08:16.160
Yes, Max!

08:16.190 --> 08:19.160
Oh, no. I was trying to
hit a fly on my button.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.060
Would you like to give
the answer a shot anyway?

08:23.100 --> 08:24.100
Oh, sure. Why not?

08:24.130 --> 08:27.870
Uh... Drain a room
filled with water,

08:27.900 --> 08:32.110
transport out of the room,
and then flash on a sweater.

08:32.140 --> 08:34.010
Correct!

08:34.039 --> 08:35.179
No, challenge!

08:35.210 --> 08:37.080
No, no, no. Max didn't
get the last spell right.

08:39.780 --> 08:42.950
Wizard Council, what is your ruling?

08:50.130 --> 08:52.960
The exact use of
<i>Cashmereus-appearus</i>

08:53.000 --> 08:55.130
is to flash on a cashmere sweater...

08:55.170 --> 08:57.230
Ah-ha!

08:57.270 --> 08:59.800
So we will accept Max's answer.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.070
What?

09:02.110 --> 09:05.810
I got it right? Ma! I'm gonna
be the Russo family wizard!

09:05.840 --> 09:08.980
Bow down to the more powerful sibling!

09:12.950 --> 09:15.780
Now would be a good time
to take a commercial break

09:15.820 --> 09:18.090
so I can explain to Max how this all works.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.820
If you think that's going to help.

09:24.190 --> 09:27.730
We'll be back with
Round Two after the break.

09:27.770 --> 09:31.170
Justin Russo in the lead with 300 points.

09:31.200 --> 09:34.110
Go, Justin!
That's my boyfriend!

09:34.140 --> 09:37.840
Juliet! You made it.

09:38.910 --> 09:40.110
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I would've been here earlier,

09:40.150 --> 09:43.750
- but I was at a blood drive.
- How was it?

09:43.780 --> 09:45.120
Oh, it was...
It was delicious.

09:47.050 --> 09:48.750
Well, I'm here...

09:48.790 --> 09:50.220
Do you have any words
of encouragement for me?

09:50.260 --> 09:52.160
Um...

09:52.190 --> 09:54.260
If you don't win, I'll leave you?

09:56.160 --> 09:58.060
Tough love.

09:58.100 --> 10:00.100
That'll work.
Yeah, that'll work.

10:00.130 --> 10:01.870
Thank you. OK.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.900
OK. Meaningful stare.

10:12.280 --> 10:15.020
Alex, I'm starting to get a little worried

10:15.050 --> 10:16.850
and embarrassed rooting for you,

10:16.890 --> 10:20.020
but you're still my number one.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.990
OK, the first part of what you just said?

10:23.030 --> 10:24.160
Mason, stop being a jerk.

10:24.190 --> 10:25.890
And the second part?

10:25.930 --> 10:27.300
Aw, you're so sweet.

10:35.940 --> 10:37.900
Hello Mason.

10:39.110 --> 10:41.010
Juliet.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.810
Been a while.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.950
You know, the last time I saw you,

10:44.980 --> 10:46.850
I made you turn into a wolf forever.

10:46.880 --> 10:50.890
And I made you turn old
and hobble off into the woods.

10:50.920 --> 10:54.120
- No hard feelings?
- Water under the bridge.

10:55.130 --> 10:57.090
Go Justin!

10:57.130 --> 10:59.070
Go Alex!

11:06.110 --> 11:08.180
Oh, gosh. Alex is way behind,

11:08.210 --> 11:11.110
and if she loses, she'll
just be normal like me.

11:12.120 --> 11:13.980
Yeah!

11:15.150 --> 11:17.190
Oh... This is the first
time I've been in here

11:17.220 --> 11:19.920
without Justin to yell at me
to leave stuff alone.

11:21.190 --> 11:24.160
Oh! I wonder
what these pants do!

11:24.200 --> 11:27.260
I bet you I could pull these off
with the right kind of shoes.

11:27.300 --> 11:30.170
Could you just put
those hideous pants back?

11:30.200 --> 11:31.970
They could be dangerous.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.970
How could they be dangerous?

11:34.010 --> 11:35.870
They don't even have a zipper.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.940
Would you just sit down and watch?

11:39.980 --> 11:41.210
I'll make us some popcorn.

11:41.250 --> 11:43.010
Hmm.

11:43.050 --> 11:46.280
Bet you there's something I can
use to make popcorn in here...

11:50.290 --> 11:55.860
Corn-poppy with butter
on-toppy!

11:58.930 --> 12:02.060
Zeke, put that down!

12:02.100 --> 12:05.070
What? I was just smelling it.

12:12.210 --> 12:14.940
What just happened?
I just turned purple!

12:16.110 --> 12:18.110
This says
"Purple Murple Potion."

12:18.150 --> 12:20.150
You made me snort when you scared me.

12:20.180 --> 12:23.090
You know I always snort when I get scared!

12:23.120 --> 12:26.020
What do we do? What do we do?

12:26.060 --> 12:28.790
It... It itches!
It itches from the inside out!

12:28.830 --> 12:32.160
It must be my murple.
My murple's on fire!

12:34.260 --> 12:37.100
We're three minutes into round two,

12:37.130 --> 12:39.270
and our competitors continue to cook up

12:39.300 --> 12:41.800
a "freshen your breath" potion

12:41.840 --> 12:45.140
that I insist be judged
by Professor Crumbs.

12:46.910 --> 12:49.280
I don't hear the ladies complaining.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.950
Over here, at Justin's table,

12:54.980 --> 12:57.190
he's making good use
of the secret ingredient,

12:57.220 --> 13:00.190
- dried bat tail tips.
- Voila!

13:00.220 --> 13:02.220
Whenever I cook potions,
I like to say foreign words.

13:06.030 --> 13:08.000
Max, what are you doing over there?

13:08.030 --> 13:11.100
That reeks worse than butt of newt.

13:11.130 --> 13:12.200
That's because I'm doing my laundry.

13:12.240 --> 13:14.000
I'm going to get to the potion in a minute.

13:15.840 --> 13:19.210
- What a charming young man.
- Coming through.

13:19.240 --> 13:23.810
There goes Alex with a
live griffin in a jar.

13:23.850 --> 13:27.220
Half eagle, half lion.
They're quite ferocious.

13:27.250 --> 13:29.120
I guess that's why we store them

13:29.150 --> 13:32.290
in the same kind of a
container we keep cookies in.

13:35.090 --> 13:37.990
Come on, buddy. I just
want one of your feathers.

13:39.830 --> 13:41.030
Help! Help!

13:42.900 --> 13:45.100
Harper? What are you...
What are you doing here?

13:45.130 --> 13:47.100
We need your help.
Zeke sniffed some potion

13:47.140 --> 13:48.240
and turned all purple.

13:48.270 --> 13:51.170
I'm sorry! I was nosing
around with my nose.

13:51.210 --> 13:53.940
The griffin is going nuts!

14:00.320 --> 14:01.880
Oh, my gosh!

14:01.920 --> 14:03.280
Get that purple guy out of here!

14:03.320 --> 14:05.320
The griffin thinks he's food!

14:11.830 --> 14:13.190
Harper! Zeke!

14:19.130 --> 14:22.840
This is probably a
good time to go to commercial.

14:22.870 --> 14:25.070
We might be right back!

14:28.310 --> 14:30.710
That griffin debacle was nuts!

14:33.310 --> 14:34.480
Now that's great showmanship.

14:35.510 --> 14:37.450
Now, if everyone's calmed down,

14:37.480 --> 14:39.350
we can get back into the competition.

14:39.390 --> 14:41.420
Wait, wait... What?

14:41.450 --> 14:43.590
Am I the only one that saw what happened?

14:43.620 --> 14:46.290
That griffin flew away with our friends.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.660
Your friends will be fine.

14:47.690 --> 14:50.530
The Monster Hunters are on the case...

14:50.560 --> 14:53.660
Although, they do have a rich
history of losing to griffins.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.700
Think you can have those
Monster Hunters bring me

14:57.740 --> 14:59.470
the griffin wings when
they're done with them?

15:00.470 --> 15:01.470
Even if I lose tonight,

15:01.510 --> 15:03.410
I still want to be able to fly, you know?

15:05.580 --> 15:08.210
Max, Justin, we have to go help them.

15:08.250 --> 15:09.480
Alex, I'm sure the Monster
Hunters will bring

15:09.510 --> 15:10.610
Harper and Zeke back.

15:10.650 --> 15:12.280
You just want to go after them

15:12.320 --> 15:13.350
because you're way behind in points.

15:13.390 --> 15:14.350
Yeah Alex, forget it.

15:14.390 --> 15:15.690
You guys, look.

15:15.720 --> 15:17.620
If you don't get back in the competition,

15:17.660 --> 15:19.560
I'm going to have to charge
you with delay of game

15:19.590 --> 15:21.230
unless you use a time-out.

15:21.260 --> 15:23.390
Wait. Can we use
all of our time-outs

15:23.430 --> 15:24.660
to go help Harper and Zeke?

15:24.700 --> 15:26.530
Hm...

15:26.570 --> 15:28.530
Well, it's never been done,
but I guess you could.

15:28.570 --> 15:31.300
Come on, you guys.
We can do this.

15:31.340 --> 15:32.600
Justin, you're a trained Monster Hunter.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.440
This is your chance
to prove how good you are.

15:34.470 --> 15:36.670
And Max, you...
want to attach

15:36.710 --> 15:39.410
griffin wings to your arms and fly.

15:40.580 --> 15:42.380
So, you're saying that'll work?

15:42.410 --> 15:43.510
All right, I'm in!

15:46.620 --> 15:48.520
Justin, we can't do it without you.

15:50.520 --> 15:51.590
How much time do we have?

15:51.620 --> 15:53.660
Forty-five minutes.

15:55.290 --> 15:57.290
Justin, please?

15:59.460 --> 16:01.360
All right, come on. Let's go.

16:03.700 --> 16:05.600
Now, wait...

16:05.630 --> 16:07.470
I hate to be a Debbie Downer,

16:07.500 --> 16:10.210
but whoever doesn't get
back before time elapses

16:10.240 --> 16:11.540
is out of the competition.

16:11.570 --> 16:14.240
OK, we've saved the Wizard
World like ten times.

16:14.280 --> 16:15.310
I think we've got this.

16:44.410 --> 16:46.680
The griffin nest is up there,
this must be the place.

16:46.710 --> 16:49.350
OK, where's the griffin?
We have to hurry.

16:49.710 --> 16:51.410
Hey, check it out.

16:51.450 --> 16:54.280
The Monster Hunters left their
equipment behind for us to use.

16:56.290 --> 16:59.460
But what are we supposed to do
with this pile of charred bones?

17:00.660 --> 17:03.330
She's here!
I found Harper!

17:03.360 --> 17:04.430
Go!

17:04.460 --> 17:06.500
Harper, are you OK?

17:06.530 --> 17:08.630
Does it look like I'm OK?

17:08.670 --> 17:11.400
I can't really hear you
through all the goop.

17:13.470 --> 17:15.410
Whoa!

17:21.480 --> 17:23.510
OK, OK, she's stuck in griffin spit.

17:23.550 --> 17:25.520
That's what they do to hold
food for their hatchlings.

17:25.550 --> 17:28.520
Ew. Ew. Ew...

17:29.590 --> 17:31.690
Yup, that's griffin spit.

17:31.720 --> 17:34.220
Bird, with a hint of cat.

17:36.460 --> 17:38.430
Will you just get me out of here?

17:38.460 --> 17:40.230
I'll get you out.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.530
Piggly wiggly, get out of the jiggly.

17:44.270 --> 17:45.500
Thank you so much.

17:45.540 --> 17:47.440
I really hate being spit on.

17:47.470 --> 17:50.670
- OK. Now where's Zeke?
- Let's go find him.

17:50.710 --> 17:53.240
Guys, there is no time.
We'll come back for him later.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.580
No, I am not leaving without Zeke.

17:54.610 --> 17:56.380
Harper, I was just being a nice guy.

17:56.410 --> 17:57.720
There is no coming back for Zeke.

17:59.650 --> 18:01.550
I think the griffin ate him.

18:03.320 --> 18:05.560
I've made my peace with it,
you should, too. Let's go.

18:05.590 --> 18:07.520
Wait, wait!

18:07.560 --> 18:09.290
Ugh, wait...

18:12.630 --> 18:14.600
I'm good. He ate me,

18:14.630 --> 18:17.500
but I clog-danced in his
stomach, got barfed out!

18:17.530 --> 18:19.600
- Whoo!
- Zeke!

18:20.640 --> 18:22.300
It's OK. All right.

18:22.340 --> 18:23.710
- Oh...
- Oh.

18:25.380 --> 18:27.610
Let's get you back to normal.
You smell like griffin barf.

18:30.480 --> 18:32.620
OK, come on you guys. We need
to get back to the competition.

18:37.390 --> 18:40.590
Oh, no! I don't want
to be thrown up again!

18:40.630 --> 18:43.460
It's like a warm, smelly,
gooey water slide.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.260
Guys, we need to get out of here!

18:45.300 --> 18:46.630
Get to the carpet! Go!

18:46.660 --> 18:49.270
- Come on! Let's go!
- No!

19:01.280 --> 19:03.380
OK, I've about had it with you,

19:03.410 --> 19:05.350
half-bird, half-lion,
bat-winged freak.

19:05.380 --> 19:06.550
Just get out of our way!

19:06.580 --> 19:07.550
Yeah!

19:11.620 --> 19:13.490
- She said it, not me!
- Hey!

19:13.520 --> 19:17.190
- Just go, go, go!
- Whoa!

19:17.230 --> 19:19.460
Max! Max, if you
can distract it,

19:19.500 --> 19:22.400
I can use my Monster Hunter mind
technique to put it to sleep.

19:22.430 --> 19:24.400
You can really do that?

19:24.430 --> 19:26.230
Yes! I've done it
on a hamster,

19:26.270 --> 19:28.500
and it was little so it was more of a tap.

19:28.540 --> 19:31.370
- Good enough!
- OK! All right...

19:32.640 --> 19:35.440
Now, you guys know my
favorite distraction, right?

19:46.260 --> 19:48.260
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Whoa...

19:54.270 --> 19:56.270
Guys, I have an idea.

19:56.300 --> 19:58.300
Use the rope spell when I tell you to.

20:02.340 --> 20:03.440
Hey!

20:03.480 --> 20:05.380
Hey! Come and get me!

20:05.410 --> 20:07.350
Are those griffin wings or chicken wings?

20:10.650 --> 20:12.350
Now!

20:12.380 --> 20:14.590
Soap on a rope.
Soap fell off the rope.

20:14.620 --> 20:17.560
Rope shot out of my hand.
Rope tie up that griff-an.

20:18.760 --> 20:19.760
Oh!

20:26.400 --> 20:28.400
Now!

20:31.440 --> 20:34.540
Ha ha! We showed him!

20:35.570 --> 20:37.440
OK, hurry up.
We gotta get out of here.

20:38.510 --> 20:40.580
OK, no. This time
I'm taking the lead.

20:40.610 --> 20:42.480
You drive like an old wizard lady.

20:47.720 --> 20:51.360
Zeke, we've landed, you can let go of me.

20:51.390 --> 20:53.520
Dude, you need to cut your nails.

20:56.400 --> 20:57.760
Guys, where is everybody?

20:59.470 --> 21:01.730
What happened to the disco floor?

21:02.740 --> 21:04.370
Oh, no.

21:05.340 --> 21:08.240
Hello? We're back!

21:08.270 --> 21:10.640
We can start up with the lights
and the competition stuff!

21:12.450 --> 21:15.280
The competition is over.

21:15.320 --> 21:17.450
Awesome! Who won?

21:18.590 --> 21:21.250
No way. We called a time-out.

21:21.290 --> 21:22.660
Which expired.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.590
As has the competition for you.

21:26.630 --> 21:29.430
You are hereby disqualified.

21:29.470 --> 21:31.500
Alex, I told you we shouldn't have gone.

21:31.530 --> 21:34.300
Professor Crumbs, listen to me.
There's gotta be something we can do about this.

21:34.340 --> 21:35.570
Yeah, we saved two people.

21:35.610 --> 21:37.310
What you did was noble,

21:37.340 --> 21:39.510
but you were warned of the
rules before you left.

21:39.540 --> 21:43.510
I am deeply saddened
that it has come to this,

21:43.550 --> 21:48.420
but the Russo family line
of wizards will end forever.

21:48.450 --> 21:50.420
Professor Crumbs...

21:50.450 --> 21:52.520
Your wands, please.

21:59.730 --> 22:04.670
This will be the last time
we will ever see each other.

22:12.480 --> 22:14.410
We're not wizards anymore.

22:20.040 --> 22:20.980
My gosh.

22:21.310 --> 22:25.140
Why aren't they back yet?
I hope they're all right.

22:25.180 --> 22:27.150
They're not going to be when they find out

22:27.180 --> 22:29.050
they've been disqualified.

22:36.290 --> 22:38.960
Oh, thank goodness you're all OK.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.700
I can't believe this.

22:42.730 --> 22:45.430
I... I prepared myself
knowing the next time

22:45.470 --> 22:46.630
I walked through that portal that,

22:46.670 --> 22:49.440
that only one of us
would be the family wizard,

22:49.470 --> 22:51.740
not none of us would be the family wizard.

22:51.770 --> 22:54.440
And not just us.

22:54.480 --> 22:55.910
Any Russo from now on.

22:57.810 --> 23:01.650
Alex just cut down our
family tree and burned it.

23:01.680 --> 23:04.790
I told you that I thought
we'd make it back in time.

23:04.820 --> 23:07.620
Come on, Justin. Now's not the
time to point fingers, honey.

23:07.660 --> 23:09.790
Remember you promised each other

23:09.830 --> 23:12.630
not to let the competition
come between you.

23:12.660 --> 23:14.630
There is no competition,

23:14.660 --> 23:17.500
so that deal's off, because of her.

23:17.530 --> 23:19.700
Come on, Justin, she was just
trying to help her friends.

23:19.740 --> 23:22.470
Wait. Maybe
everything's OK.

23:22.500 --> 23:25.640
I mean, the Lair and all of
wizard books are still here.

23:25.670 --> 23:28.680
Ooh, well. That's
not really a good sign.

23:32.810 --> 23:35.420
What's happening?

23:35.450 --> 23:36.680
Everything in the Lair is vanishing.

23:36.720 --> 23:38.450
We need to get out of here
before we disappear,

23:38.490 --> 23:39.890
- like everything else.
- No! I need to sit in

23:39.920 --> 23:42.860
- my comfy chair one more time!
- Dad, we don't have time!

23:42.890 --> 23:44.460
Get up!

24:02.580 --> 24:04.780
It's over.

24:04.810 --> 24:06.650
We're not wizards anymore.

24:10.890 --> 24:12.820
We're mortals.

24:14.560 --> 24:15.660
That's it?

24:15.690 --> 24:17.690
Just like that?

24:17.730 --> 24:21.500
Yeah. Just like that.

24:26.600 --> 24:27.700
Hey, don't listen to them.

24:27.740 --> 24:29.600
You did what you believed was right.

24:29.640 --> 24:31.600
Thank you.

24:31.640 --> 24:33.710
But if I'm not going to be a wizard,

24:33.740 --> 24:35.540
that means that we can't be together.

24:35.580 --> 24:37.610
Well, I won't accept that.

24:37.650 --> 24:39.450
There are a lot of things I can do

24:39.480 --> 24:42.420
to keep me from going
werewolf and eating you.

24:42.450 --> 24:45.890
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going out for 50 hamburgers.

24:50.760 --> 24:51.860
I'm sorry, guys.

24:51.890 --> 24:53.530
This is all my fault

24:53.560 --> 24:54.760
for turning myself purple.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.530
No. No, it's not, Zeke.

24:56.570 --> 24:57.930
You wouldn't have played with that potion

24:57.970 --> 25:01.500
if I hadn't invited you into the Lair
to watch the Wizard Competition.

25:02.940 --> 25:04.710
Did you guys hear that?

25:04.740 --> 25:06.840
She said it's all on her.
I'm totally in the clear.

25:08.610 --> 25:11.580
Don't worry about it, Zeke.
This one's all on Alex.

25:14.420 --> 25:18.620
Fine. Fine, Justin, you can
blame it all on me if you want.

25:18.650 --> 25:20.590
I'm the reason that we're
not wizards anymore.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.720
There. I said it.
Is everything better now?

25:22.760 --> 25:25.430
No, it'll never be better.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.660
I agree with Justin.

25:29.700 --> 25:30.860
You ruined everything.

25:30.900 --> 25:34.700
Hey, lighten up on your sister.

25:37.810 --> 25:39.870
I'm sorry, <i>mija.</i>

25:39.910 --> 25:43.480
Mom, just because you call <i>mija</i>
does not make it all better.

25:43.510 --> 25:45.580
I know, <i>mija.</i>

25:52.760 --> 25:54.720
I'll be your <i>mija.</i>

25:57.630 --> 25:58.790
That's OK.

26:07.640 --> 26:10.670
Justin, I need that chicken
salad sandwich for table four.

26:10.710 --> 26:13.480
Yeah, well, I need a lifetime
full of wizard powers.

26:13.510 --> 26:15.610
Looks like neither of us
are gonna get what we want.

26:15.650 --> 26:17.480
We're out of chicken salad.

26:17.520 --> 26:19.620
Why didn't you tell me that before?

26:19.650 --> 26:21.480
I've been waiting 20 minutes.

26:22.750 --> 26:24.520
Hey, Justin,

26:24.560 --> 26:25.860
I need a chicken salad
sandwich for table 12.

26:25.890 --> 26:27.790
Oh, here you go.

26:27.830 --> 26:30.390
Wow, that was fast!

26:30.430 --> 26:32.830
That's very funny, I see what you're doing.

26:34.570 --> 26:35.730
Alex, I'm really sorry.

26:35.770 --> 26:37.570
I mean, if we had magical powers,

26:37.600 --> 26:38.770
we could probably keep up
with all of these orders.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.870
But we don't, you know, so we can't.

26:40.900 --> 26:43.670
- Give me the sandwich, Max.
- Alex, I just took the order.

26:43.710 --> 26:45.680
- My table has been waiting...
- You're not going to take my sandwich, Alex.

26:45.710 --> 26:47.780
- He just made it for me...
- Hey! Hey!

26:47.810 --> 26:49.510
What is going on here?

26:49.550 --> 26:51.710
Justin is messing up all of my orders.

26:51.750 --> 26:53.820
Kitchen, now.

26:58.650 --> 27:02.890
OK, you guys. I know none of
this worked out like you hoped,

27:02.930 --> 27:04.730
but I need you to get past it.

27:04.760 --> 27:07.430
Put your differences
aside and work together.

27:07.460 --> 27:09.400
Yeah, listen to your father.

27:09.430 --> 27:11.700
You've got to learn
to be happy without magic.

27:11.730 --> 27:13.430
I know I am.

27:14.740 --> 27:15.840
- No problem.
- All right.

27:18.670 --> 27:21.680
All right, now give her her sandwich.

27:21.710 --> 27:23.550
OK. Give me a second.

27:25.480 --> 27:26.650
Hey, Alex!

27:26.680 --> 27:28.590
Here's your sandwich.
Think fast.

27:29.750 --> 27:31.790
- Alex!
- I am so sorry!

27:31.820 --> 27:33.690
- You did that on purpose.
- No, I didn't.

27:33.720 --> 27:36.390
Justin just threw
the sandwich at me. Dad!

27:36.430 --> 27:37.660
I can't believe this.

27:37.700 --> 27:40.760
I am so sorry. We will
get you a new sandwich.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.560
And we'll pay for the dry cleaning.

27:42.600 --> 27:43.600
What?

27:44.630 --> 27:46.440
What got into you guys?

27:46.470 --> 27:48.600
We just talked about
you guys working together.

27:48.640 --> 27:50.770
I didn't do anything.
He's the one being a jerk.

27:50.810 --> 27:52.470
I can't work with her.

27:52.510 --> 27:53.580
Well, if he can't work with her,

27:53.610 --> 27:54.810
then I can't work with her.

27:54.840 --> 27:55.840
These are your kids?

27:56.850 --> 28:00.520
- Good luck.
- What? Ma'am...

28:00.550 --> 28:02.720
Look what you're doing!
You're driving customers away.

28:02.750 --> 28:05.490
You know what? Why don't you
guys just get out of here.

28:05.520 --> 28:07.390
Your mother and I will handle it.

28:07.420 --> 28:08.760
Now!

28:15.800 --> 28:17.700
I'm sorry, <i>mija.</i>

28:19.670 --> 28:20.870
Yeah, that doesn't help.

28:29.480 --> 28:31.450
Oh. There's Justin.

28:31.480 --> 28:32.550
Let's just go around the
block and through the alley.

28:32.580 --> 28:34.420
No, OK. This is
getting ridiculous.

28:34.450 --> 28:35.680
You guys have been at each other for weeks.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.490
You can't even stand each other.

28:37.520 --> 28:38.820
Come on, we're going to fix this right now.

28:38.850 --> 28:40.450
Harper, no.

28:40.490 --> 28:42.590
I can go a few more weeks
without talking to him.

28:42.620 --> 28:43.690
Or, forever.

28:45.560 --> 28:47.390
Oh, you.

28:47.430 --> 28:48.760
Yeah, I forgot something in the shop.

28:48.800 --> 28:51.760
No, come on.
You two, come on.

28:51.800 --> 28:54.570
OK...

28:54.600 --> 28:56.470
Make up.

28:57.870 --> 28:59.610
One, two, three, go!

28:59.640 --> 29:01.540
- It's not going to happen.
- Not in this lifetime.

29:01.580 --> 29:02.910
See? They're the problem.

29:09.490 --> 29:11.350
"Business for Sale"?

29:11.390 --> 29:12.720
Dad, what are you doing?

29:16.790 --> 29:19.830
Dad, what's happening?

29:19.860 --> 29:21.630
I'm selling the business.

29:21.660 --> 29:23.530
What? Why?

29:23.570 --> 29:26.530
Well, I've always loved the Sub Station

29:26.570 --> 29:27.640
because it was a family business,

29:27.670 --> 29:30.540
but we're not much of a family anymore.

29:30.570 --> 29:31.740
Well... Dad!

29:31.770 --> 29:33.840
Aren't you rushing into this?

29:33.870 --> 29:36.580
Dad!

29:36.610 --> 29:38.610
Mom, what's going to happen?

29:38.650 --> 29:40.610
I don't know.

29:40.650 --> 29:43.750
But your father is heartbroken.

29:48.820 --> 29:52.730
Well, I am so
disappointed in you <i>mijas.</i>

29:55.530 --> 29:58.500
I don't know how the whole
<i>mija</i> thing works, so...

30:01.500 --> 30:03.810
Nice going, Alex.
Look what you did to Dad.

30:03.840 --> 30:06.670
Well, I didn't do it alone.

30:06.710 --> 30:10.510
But... it doesn't matter,
because I'm not going to let.

30:10.550 --> 30:12.450
Dad throw everything away
because you guys hate me.

30:13.580 --> 30:15.520
Oh, what? So, you're going
to keep this place going?

30:15.550 --> 30:17.890
No, I don't think so. I am.

30:17.920 --> 30:20.760
Now that I don't have magic,
this is all I've got.

30:20.790 --> 30:23.490
No! I've got this.

30:23.530 --> 30:24.660
This is all I'm good at,

30:24.690 --> 30:26.700
and I've got to make sure
you guys don't mess this up.

30:27.770 --> 30:28.900
Now, if you'll excuse me,

30:28.930 --> 30:30.700
I'm going to go explain to Harper

30:30.740 --> 30:32.470

32:27.520 --> 32:29.660
Oh, thanks hon.
I'm exhausted.

32:29.690 --> 32:31.520
I can't believe how busy we were.

32:31.560 --> 32:33.430
Yeah, Alex had so much going on

32:33.460 --> 32:34.830
she made a sandwich with peanut butter

32:34.860 --> 32:36.730
on the outside of the bread.

32:36.770 --> 32:38.530
No, no, no.
I did that on purpose.

32:38.570 --> 32:40.900
That's what a 40 year old gets
for ordering off the kids menu.

32:42.640 --> 32:45.710
I know, I got so busy I had to
start writing orders on my arm.

32:46.840 --> 32:49.510
You spelled pie wrong.

32:50.810 --> 32:51.910
I ran out of desserts,

32:51.950 --> 32:54.880
so I had to start selling
Max's Halloween candy.

32:54.920 --> 32:59.790
Uh, Jerry, Max hasn't gone trick
or treating in three years.

32:59.820 --> 33:01.560
Oh.

33:01.590 --> 33:03.590
- Ew.
- Yuck.

33:08.500 --> 33:10.430
Listen, you guys.

33:10.470 --> 33:13.740
I'm really sorry for messing
up the Wizard Competition.

33:13.770 --> 33:16.670
I didn't mean to ruin your lives.

33:16.710 --> 33:19.540
You didn't ruin my life.

33:19.570 --> 33:21.880
We all did great today.

33:21.910 --> 33:24.680
I'm going to have a
good life without magic.

33:27.450 --> 33:30.450
Max, will you forgive me too?

33:31.850 --> 33:33.650
Alex, of course I forgive you.

33:33.690 --> 33:35.860
Any sister of Justin's is a sister of mine.

33:37.790 --> 33:40.590
And none of you can say
that didn't make any sense.

33:40.630 --> 33:43.460
- Now, this is my family.
- Yeah.

33:43.500 --> 33:46.770
A bunch of people selling barely
edible food to an unsuspecting public.

33:46.800 --> 33:48.800
Oh, those are the Russo's I know.

33:51.710 --> 33:55.780
Seriously, though. I'm so proud of
you all for getting through this.

33:57.580 --> 33:58.710
What's going on?

34:02.520 --> 34:04.880
And that's the end of round two.

34:04.920 --> 34:07.550
We'll be back right after this.

34:07.590 --> 34:08.719
What just happened?

34:08.760 --> 34:11.520
You're back in the competition.

34:12.460 --> 34:13.690
What?

34:13.730 --> 34:15.630
Where do I know you from?

34:24.179 --> 34:25.510
Professor Crumbs, I don't understand.

34:25.540 --> 34:27.409
I thought we were disqualified?

34:27.449 --> 34:29.350
The griffin was a test.

34:29.380 --> 34:31.449
Based on past history with the Russo's,

34:31.480 --> 34:35.179
we found it necessary
to test your sibling bond.

34:35.219 --> 34:37.350
When Justin and Max forgave Alex,

34:37.389 --> 34:39.489
you all passed through round two.

34:41.460 --> 34:43.429
Does that mean Harper and Zeke
were in on it, too?

34:43.460 --> 34:45.159
No.

34:45.199 --> 34:48.429
The griffin was supposed
to take Professor Crumbs.

34:48.469 --> 34:52.469
But, apparently he was hungry
for something a little fresher,

34:52.500 --> 34:57.310
and, uh, he went for your
colorful friend instead.

34:58.310 --> 35:00.380
Gosh, we're back in the competition!

35:00.410 --> 35:01.540
I can still win!

35:01.580 --> 35:05.350
Yes, it's a crazy, crazy game
with a cruel and miserable.

35:05.380 --> 35:08.320
Round Two that everyone
but the Russo's enjoyed.

35:09.590 --> 35:13.450
Anyway, one of you will be
the Last Wizard Standing.

35:13.490 --> 35:16.320
Now I know where I know you from.

35:21.560 --> 35:26.300
We start round three with Justin
in the lead with 300 points,

35:26.340 --> 35:30.210
Max has 250, and Alex has zero.

35:30.240 --> 35:32.510
Yeah, they can see it.
Don't need to rub it in.

35:34.450 --> 35:37.420
Now, we're gonna show
you scenes from your life

35:37.450 --> 35:40.450
where magic went awry.

35:40.490 --> 35:43.320
And we all know there's plenty of those.

35:44.590 --> 35:49.360
For 100 points, buzz in with a spell

35:49.390 --> 35:51.360
that could solve the problem.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.530
First scene...

36:00.410 --> 36:03.640
When a fairy crashes your
school play, you can use.

36:03.670 --> 36:05.210
"It's too late to save this play,

36:05.240 --> 36:06.580
but make this fairy go away."

36:06.610 --> 36:11.210
Correct! Alex is on the
board with 100 points!

36:11.250 --> 36:12.450
Next scene...

36:12.480 --> 36:15.520
<i>Vote for Justin.</i>
<i>Vote for Justin.</i>

36:17.460 --> 36:19.590
When you want posters to stop talking, say.

36:19.620 --> 36:21.490
"Posters, posters, didn't squeal at all.

36:21.530 --> 36:23.260
Zip it up and stay on the wall."

36:23.290 --> 36:25.130
When you want your
brothers to stop talking,

36:25.160 --> 36:26.330
a good wand flick to the head.

36:26.360 --> 36:28.330
Correct again!

36:28.370 --> 36:31.440
- And brutal.
- Oh, thank you.

36:32.540 --> 36:35.510
Somebody want to check Justin's buzzer?

36:35.540 --> 36:38.480
It's working fine.

36:38.510 --> 36:40.440
Even more embarrassing.

36:42.480 --> 36:45.150
And now for the third and final scene...

36:45.180 --> 36:46.350
<i>Oh, no!</i>

36:46.380 --> 36:47.550
<i>The alarm, something's wrong!</i>

36:47.590 --> 36:49.490
The answer is me.

36:49.520 --> 36:51.460
Ah, I'm up there in the crystal ball.

36:51.490 --> 36:54.220
Yes, you are, Max.

36:54.260 --> 36:56.530
Unfortunately, this is not
the part of the competition

36:56.560 --> 36:59.430
where you tell us who's
on the crystal ball.

36:59.460 --> 37:01.600
That's not me up there?

37:01.630 --> 37:04.440
Wow. That looks exactly like me.

37:08.340 --> 37:10.410
When you're going out of control
in a miniature submarine

37:10.440 --> 37:12.410
you use "Proton,
neutron, get gone."

37:14.380 --> 37:16.350
Sorry, Justin.
That is incorrect.

37:17.550 --> 37:19.520
"Proton, neutron, back to one."

37:19.550 --> 37:22.120
That's correct again!

37:22.160 --> 37:24.260
Alex Russo takes all the points!

37:25.460 --> 37:26.560
Yeah!

37:29.630 --> 37:33.430
At the end of round three, Alex and
Justin are tied with 300 points.

37:33.470 --> 37:36.470
But Max is close behind with 250.

37:36.500 --> 37:38.140
That's it, 250!

37:38.170 --> 37:40.140
That's second place. Ah-ha!

37:40.170 --> 37:41.510
Which means I'm the first loser.

37:41.540 --> 37:43.410
Yeah, I'm number one.

37:44.340 --> 37:45.550
Ha ha! Max!

37:45.580 --> 37:47.310
I know it doesn't make any sense,

37:47.350 --> 37:48.620
but we should cheer him anyway.

37:48.650 --> 37:50.620
Yeah! Max!

37:50.650 --> 37:55.490
We'll be right back with the
final round that decides who

37:55.520 --> 38:00.490
will be the Last Wizard Standing!

38:06.370 --> 38:07.500
She caught up to me.

38:07.540 --> 38:09.300
I thought I'd be way ahead by now.

38:09.340 --> 38:12.170
OK. Uh... Justin,
get your head in the game,

38:12.210 --> 38:14.370
or I'll vampire up and take your ear off.

38:15.480 --> 38:18.240
Great pep talk.
Butterfly kiss?

38:21.180 --> 38:23.520
Alex? You're tied
for first place!

38:23.550 --> 38:25.450
I'm so surprised you
actually have a chance!

38:25.490 --> 38:27.250
I had no idea you could do this!

38:27.290 --> 38:29.290
- All right.
- No, really. It's a miracle.

38:29.320 --> 38:31.360
- That's enough.
- Are you cheating?

38:31.390 --> 38:33.160
Mason!

38:33.190 --> 38:35.290
I have always believed in you!

38:39.370 --> 38:41.200
Go Alex!

38:42.570 --> 38:45.440
And I'm the last werewolf standing.

38:49.540 --> 38:53.150
Ladies and gentlemen, the Final Round.

38:55.280 --> 38:57.350
The competitors must use their powers

38:57.390 --> 39:00.220
to navigate a magical obstacle course

39:00.260 --> 39:03.430
that ends in The Labyrinth of Stone.

39:03.460 --> 39:06.330
The scores are so close
that whoever gets back first

39:06.360 --> 39:11.270
will become the Russo Family Wizard.

39:13.300 --> 39:16.370
Alex, Justin, Max...

39:16.410 --> 39:18.510
Take your starting positions.

39:21.280 --> 39:23.180
On your mark.

39:23.580 --> 39:26.150
Get set.

39:39.290 --> 39:41.530
Whoa! What is this place?

39:45.370 --> 39:47.530
It's a lava river with a scary bridge.

39:47.570 --> 39:50.300
How could you make it this far?

39:52.210 --> 39:54.380
Looks too narrow for the three of us.

39:54.410 --> 39:56.140
I think that's the idea.

39:56.180 --> 39:57.480
I know.

39:59.380 --> 40:00.580
I'm going for it.

40:26.340 --> 40:28.280
Hey! Get your own rock!

40:44.660 --> 40:46.660
<i>Geilsjay-timesday.</i>

40:50.600 --> 40:52.370
Awesome.

40:52.400 --> 40:53.700
As long as I hop, you guys stay frozen.

40:58.270 --> 41:00.310
<i>Levitatus me-atus.</i>

41:01.310 --> 41:02.580
Excuse me, coming through.

41:02.610 --> 41:04.410
Pardon me. Whew!

41:15.190 --> 41:17.160
Wait, who am I looking for?

41:22.200 --> 41:24.570
- Oh, it's just a maze.
- No problem.

41:24.600 --> 41:26.230
I got this.

41:40.480 --> 41:41.580
Uh.

41:47.520 --> 41:48.520
Ow!

42:05.370 --> 42:06.570
What...

42:06.610 --> 42:07.610
Oh...

42:27.390 --> 42:29.230
Uh...

42:32.500 --> 42:33.600
Argh!

42:39.310 --> 42:42.570
Yes! Check point, finally.
Whoa!

42:43.480 --> 42:44.540
Not fair.

42:53.550 --> 42:56.620
Justin! Did you find the exit?

42:56.660 --> 42:59.420
I'm not telling you.

42:59.460 --> 43:02.260
I know, but it was worth a try.

43:03.330 --> 43:06.260
Will you guys be quiet?
I'm in a maze.

43:08.430 --> 43:10.430
I don't...

43:12.540 --> 43:15.510
This is... This is getting
exciting, people.

43:15.540 --> 43:21.210
Whoever emerges first will
become our Russo Family Wizard.

43:51.350 --> 43:55.280
I keep coming to these stupid dead ends.

43:58.290 --> 44:00.520
Of course!

44:00.560 --> 44:03.230
Go through, mow through.

44:09.200 --> 44:12.570
All three Russo's have
entered the Tunnel of Mist.

44:12.600 --> 44:14.500
I'd tell you who's ahead,

44:14.540 --> 44:19.340
but I can't see, because there
seems to be a lot of mist!

44:21.340 --> 44:23.550
Thus the name, "Tunnel of Mist."

44:23.580 --> 44:25.580
This is it.

44:25.620 --> 44:28.550
- Oh, I hope it's Justin.
- I hope it's Alex.

44:28.580 --> 44:30.320
I'm going to go with Max

44:30.350 --> 44:33.220
so we can say that somebody rooted for him.

44:34.590 --> 44:36.590
I, I see someone coming!

44:40.200 --> 44:44.300
It's Justin! Justin is
the Last Wizard Standing!

44:44.330 --> 44:45.370
Yeah!

44:45.400 --> 44:46.640
I won!

44:46.670 --> 44:49.270
Oh yeah, baby!

44:59.220 --> 45:00.420
You guys OK?

45:00.450 --> 45:02.280
Good job, bro.

45:03.490 --> 45:06.420
I'm really happy for you.

45:06.460 --> 45:09.320
You mean it?

45:09.360 --> 45:13.360
I really mean it. Nobody
deserves it more than you.

45:13.400 --> 45:15.430
You're going to make a great wizard.

45:22.510 --> 45:25.570
Ladies and gentlemen of the Wizard World,

45:25.610 --> 45:28.310
it's been a fun and exciting competition,

45:28.340 --> 45:32.350
and now is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

45:32.380 --> 45:36.250
Unfortunately, it's not
the Tootietootie dancers.

45:37.560 --> 45:40.390
I am so proud of you.

45:40.420 --> 45:42.390
You did so great.

45:45.200 --> 45:48.570
You know that since I didn't win,

45:48.600 --> 45:50.540
we can't be together.

45:52.340 --> 45:54.240
In my heart, we will.

46:06.350 --> 46:10.390
It is with great pride
I hereby confer full Wizardship

46:10.420 --> 46:14.490
on Justin Vincenzo Pepe Russo.

46:15.590 --> 46:17.360
Wait!

46:17.400 --> 46:18.430
Wait.

46:20.230 --> 46:22.170
I can't accept this.

46:22.200 --> 46:23.600
What? Why?

46:23.640 --> 46:25.340
What're you talking about?

46:25.370 --> 46:27.340
What do you mean?

46:27.370 --> 46:29.380
Justin, don't do this.

46:29.410 --> 46:32.310
I have to.

46:33.380 --> 46:35.580
I have to tell everyone what happened.

46:39.190 --> 46:40.350
<i>Alex was just ahead of me,</i>

46:40.390 --> 46:42.220
<i>going into the Tunnel of Mist.</i>

46:43.590 --> 46:45.430
<i>Threemetrus Move-ee-trus.</i>

46:49.360 --> 46:51.500
What's the spell?
What's the spell?

46:51.530 --> 46:53.600
<i>Threemetrus Move-ee-trus.</i>

46:55.540 --> 46:57.470
<i>She got through the lasers
and was headed towards</i>

46:57.510 --> 46:59.410
<i>the finish line when I</i>
<i>got caught on a tree root.</i>

47:02.340 --> 47:04.280
<i>I kept pulling,</i>
<i>but it was no use.</i>

47:04.310 --> 47:05.510
<i>I thought it was over.</i>

47:13.620 --> 47:15.560
<i>Alex was about to</i>
<i>cross the finish line,</i>

47:15.590 --> 47:17.260
<i>then she came back.</i>

47:19.160 --> 47:20.290
What are you doing?

47:20.330 --> 47:21.530
I don't want to win this way.

47:24.370 --> 47:26.230
<i>Threemetrus Move-ee-trus.</i>

47:26.270 --> 47:27.430
Ha!

47:33.270 --> 47:34.310
What's going on?

47:35.310 --> 47:36.580
The finish line's right there.

47:46.350 --> 47:50.190
My sister would have won the competition.

47:50.220 --> 47:51.620
She came back to help me.

47:59.530 --> 48:02.240
I think you're the one who deserves this.

48:05.610 --> 48:08.240
Is this true, Alex?

48:09.480 --> 48:11.450
Justin...

48:11.480 --> 48:13.580
It's OK.

48:13.620 --> 48:16.380
You deserve this more than anyone.

48:18.320 --> 48:22.190
I, um... I think you're
going to make a great wizard.

48:24.360 --> 48:25.390
Kneel.

48:28.160 --> 48:29.600
Very well.

48:29.630 --> 48:33.300
I decree that Alex Russo is officially

48:33.330 --> 48:35.300
the Russo Family Wizard.

48:39.640 --> 48:43.380
That's my girl.
The Russo Family Wizard.

48:43.410 --> 48:46.210
We were this close to
becoming a normal family.

48:48.250 --> 48:49.280
Hi.

48:52.290 --> 48:53.650
Justin.

48:54.660 --> 48:56.420
May I have a word?

48:56.460 --> 48:57.560
Of course.

48:57.590 --> 49:01.530
After 3,000 years of being
Head Master of Wiztech,

49:01.560 --> 49:06.300
I'm officially announcing
my retirement immediately.

49:06.340 --> 49:07.470
What? You're retiring?

49:08.540 --> 49:11.170
And, because of your
integrity and knowledge,

49:11.210 --> 49:13.280
I want you to take my place.

49:13.310 --> 49:14.580
But...

49:14.610 --> 49:16.150
But, I'm not a wizard.

49:16.180 --> 49:18.510
Well, I think I can handle that.

49:20.420 --> 49:25.520
I confer full wizardry on
Justin Vincenzo Pepe Russo.

49:28.220 --> 49:30.460
Allow me to introduce Professor Russo

49:30.490 --> 49:34.460
who's taking my place
as Head Master of Wiztech.

49:40.540 --> 49:42.470
Wait, wait, wait.

49:42.500 --> 49:45.540
What?
I was in line for that job!

49:45.570 --> 49:48.240
I painted your Lair during my vacation.

49:48.280 --> 49:50.340
Yes, yes.

49:50.380 --> 49:53.610
Well, 2,000 years of
bad breath jokes about me...

49:53.650 --> 49:55.480
...add up.

49:58.190 --> 49:59.250
Great.

49:59.290 --> 50:01.620
You're going to make
a great wizard professor.

50:01.660 --> 50:06.560
Oh! Professor
Shnoogly-boo-boo-me-cutie-kins.

50:06.600 --> 50:08.660
I love it.

50:11.830 --> 50:15.600
Son, since Alex and Justin are
keeping their family powers

50:15.600 --> 50:19.600
I'm passing on to you the family bussiness.

50:20.200 --> 50:22.690
The Sub Shop is gonna be yours someday.

50:25.310 --> 50:27.040
So, Alex and Justin get to be wizards,

50:27.040 --> 50:29.040
and I get the family Sub Station.

50:31.240 --> 50:32.480
That's awesome!

50:33.020 --> 50:35.190
Guess what guys?
I get the Sub Station!

50:35.190 --> 50:36.790
Yeah!

50:36.790 --> 50:38.140
Oh! Check it out!

50:38.140 --> 50:40.080
We're all happy at the same time!

50:42.510 --> 50:44.990
<i>And that's</i>
<i>our show, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

50:44.990 --> 50:46.850
<i>Thanks for watching.</i>

50:47.200 --> 50:48.850
<i>And good night.</i>
