19:51.607 --> 19:54.276
It will give me great joy to
turn Phillip into a real boy.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.616
- It didn't work.

20:00.699 --> 20:01.617
- It's a big spell.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.619
Bigger than any
I've tried before.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.996
- Try again.
- She needs the Crystal.

20:06.079 --> 20:07.539
- It's okay.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.708
- Emma!

20:11.251 --> 20:15.297
- It will give me great joy to
turn Phillip into a real boy!

20:15.380 --> 20:18.592
It's useless.
It's not working.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.302
- Jax isn't
answering his phone.

20:20.385 --> 20:23.639
- Phillip.

20:23.722 --> 20:26.433
- Andi.

20:26.516 --> 20:29.227
Don't worry.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.563
I'm okay.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.401
- Stop!
You're only gonna get weaker.

20:36.485 --> 20:38.779
You've done the spell
like a dozen times.

20:38.862 --> 20:40.155
- 22 times.

20:40.238 --> 20:42.491
- I should have gone
instead of Jax.

20:42.574 --> 20:43.951
If I--

20:44.034 --> 20:45.661
- Jax!

20:45.744 --> 20:47.037
- I got it.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.372
- What took you so long?

20:48.455 --> 20:50.916
- I had to run here.
My powers don't work.

20:50.999 --> 20:53.251
- Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

20:54.962 --> 20:57.255
- Am I too late?
- You better hope not.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.801
- Do it, Emma.
- From most the spell is hidden

21:00.884 --> 21:03.261
for its results are forbidden.
But for me nothing is banned.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.430
As Chosen One,
I am in command.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.683
It will give me great joy to
turn Phillip into a real boy!

21:15.023 --> 21:16.108
- Emma!

21:18.360 --> 21:19.236
- Are you okay?

21:19.319 --> 21:20.779
- Let me get her
to the table.

21:22.322 --> 21:23.281
- Phillip?
