12:05.825 --> 12:07.259
{\an1}IT WAS PRETTY CLEVER, HUH?

12:07.326 --> 12:08.360
{\an1}I WROTE IT IN A SECRET CODE

12:08.427 --> 12:09.361
{\an1}THAT NO ONE IN A MILLION YEARS

12:09.428 --> 12:11.263
{\an1}COULD POSSIBLY FIGURE OUT.

12:11.330 --> 12:14.767
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT IS IT, BACKWARDS?

12:14.834 --> 12:15.868
{\an1}HA-- TRUE HAS A MIRROR

12:15.935 --> 12:22.475
{\an1}IN HER DESK.

12:22.541 --> 12:23.576
{\an1}YOU BROKE UNCLE MAX'S

12:23.642 --> 12:25.377
{\an1}HORSE STATUE?

12:25.444 --> 12:26.145
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

12:26.212 --> 12:27.279
{\an1}I WAS LOOKING

12:27.346 --> 12:29.448
{\an1}FOR MY HARMONICA.

12:29.515 --> 12:30.549
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT?

12:30.616 --> 12:31.517
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, I LENT IT TO HIM

12:31.584 --> 12:32.785
{\an1}LIKE A WEEK AGO AND I DON'T

12:32.852 --> 12:34.019
{\an1}REMEMBER EVER SAYING,

12:34.086 --> 12:34.753
{\an1}"OH, GO AHEAD

12:34.820 --> 12:37.289
{\an1}AND KEEP IT FOREVER!"

12:37.356 --> 12:38.724
{\an1}ANYWAY, I FIGURED

12:38.791 --> 12:40.126
{\an1}IT MIGHT BE IN HIS OFFICE.

12:40.192 --> 12:42.094
{\an1}COME ON, STUPID HARMONICA.

12:42.161 --> 12:43.162
{\an1}IF YOU CAN HEAR ME,

12:43.229 --> 12:46.932
{\an1}JUST MAKE A SOUND.

12:46.999 --> 12:51.871
{\an1}OH! OH, THAT WAS CLOSE.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.707
{\an1}OH, COME ON.

12:54.773 --> 12:56.509
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SO YOU JUST BAILED?

12:56.575 --> 12:57.076
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOT UNTIL I GLUED

12:57.143 --> 12:58.911
{\an1}THE WHOLE THING BACK TOGETHER.

12:58.978 --> 13:00.613
{\an1}I'M A GENTLEMAN LIKE THAT.

13:00.679 --> 13:02.715
{\an1}I BREAK IT, I GLUE IT.

13:02.781 --> 13:04.550
{\an1}THAT'S MY CREDO.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.018
{\an1}&gt;&gt; "MY POEMS" BY TRUE JACKSON.

13:06.085 --> 13:06.485
{\an1}I DIDN'T KNOW

13:06.552 --> 13:07.953
{\an1}TRUE WROTE POETRY.

13:08.020 --> 13:09.155
{\an1}THIS ONE'S CALLED

13:09.221 --> 13:11.056
{\an1}"MY SECRET CRUSH."

13:11.123 --> 13:12.525
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH! YOU BETTER PUT THAT BACK.

13:12.591 --> 13:22.801
{\an1}IT MIGHT BE ABOUT ME.

13:22.868 --> 13:25.070
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MR. MADIGAN.

13:25.137 --> 13:28.374
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HOW'S IT GOING, PARTNER?

13:28.440 --> 13:30.142
{\an1}YOU READ MY SECRET, DIDN'T YOU?

13:30.209 --> 13:36.549
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU'RE SELLING THE COMPANY?

13:36.615 --> 13:37.750
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BUT, HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK

13:37.816 --> 13:39.018
{\an1}ABOUT SELLING THE COMPANY?

13:39.084 --> 13:41.086
{\an1}ISN'T IT LIKE, YOUR WHOLE LIFE?

13:41.153 --> 13:42.821
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MAYBE THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

13:42.888 --> 13:43.656
{\an1}I'VE SPENT MY LIFE

13:43.722 --> 13:44.723
{\an1}BUILDING THIS PLACE,

13:44.790 --> 13:46.992
{\an1}AND FOR WHAT?

13:47.059 --> 13:49.228
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU'RE RICH.

13:49.295 --> 13:51.363
{\an1}THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

13:51.430 --> 13:52.965
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BUT, IS IT ENOUGH?

13:53.032 --> 13:53.532
{\an1}I WANTED TO TALK

13:53.599 --> 13:55.701
{\an1}ABOUT YOUR SECRET, TOO.

13:55.768 --> 13:56.802
{\an1}"I WISH PEOPLE DIDN'T THINK

13:56.869 --> 13:57.903
{\an1}I WAS DUMB."

13:57.970 --> 13:59.972
{\an1}WELL, WHO THINKS YOU'RE DUMB?

14:00.039 --> 14:02.074
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SORT OF EVERYONE.

14:02.141 --> 14:03.209
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, SO WHAT?

14:03.275 --> 14:05.144
{\an1}WHO CARES WHAT PEOPLE THINK?

14:05.211 --> 14:06.078
{\an1}SURE YOU'RE NOT GREAT

14:06.145 --> 14:07.379
{\an1}AT, SAY, SCIENCE

14:07.446 --> 14:08.581
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, I'M GREAT AT SCIENCE.

14:08.647 --> 14:09.181
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, THEN HISTORY.

14:09.248 --> 14:09.982
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'M AMAZING AT HISTORY.

14:10.049 --> 14:10.516
{\an1}&gt;&gt; GEOGRAPHY?

14:10.583 --> 14:11.050
{\an1}&gt;&gt; EASY-BREEZY.

14:11.116 --> 14:11.483
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ENGLISH.

14:11.550 --> 14:11.984
{\an1}&gt;&gt; STRAIGHT A's.

14:12.051 --> 14:14.787
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THEN WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

14:14.853 --> 14:15.387
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I GUESS IT'S THAT

14:15.454 --> 14:15.921
{\an1}NO ONE AROUND HERE

14:15.988 --> 14:17.489
{\an1}TRUSTS ME TO DO ANYTHING.

14:17.556 --> 14:18.190
{\an1}EVERYONE JUST ASSUMES

14:18.257 --> 14:19.425
{\an1}I'M GOING TO MESS UP.

14:19.491 --> 14:20.893
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YES. I CAN SEE HOW

14:20.960 --> 14:23.529
{\an1}THAT WOULD BE UPSETTING.

14:23.596 --> 14:23.963
{\an1}BY THE WAY,

14:24.029 --> 14:24.463
{\an1}YOU DIDN'T BREAK

14:24.530 --> 14:29.168
{\an1}MY HORSE STATUE, DID YOU?

14:29.235 --> 14:29.535
{\an1}SORRY.

14:29.602 --> 14:30.035
{\an1}&gt;&gt; PLEASE RETURN

14:30.102 --> 14:30.636
{\an1}TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM

14:30.703 --> 14:31.237
{\an1}IMMEDIATELY FOR MORE--

14:31.303 --> 14:42.081
{\an1}COMPANY RETREAT.

14:42.147 --> 14:43.916
{\an1}&gt;&gt; EVERYONE, MAX AND I HAD

14:43.983 --> 14:44.583
{\an1}A LITTLE CONVERSATION

14:44.650 --> 14:46.619
{\an1}ABOUT WHETHER TO PROCEED

14:46.685 --> 14:47.553
{\an1}AND WE MUTUALLY CAME

14:47.620 --> 14:50.623
{\an1}TO THE DECISION TO MOVE FORWARD.

14:50.689 --> 14:51.790
{\an1}&gt;&gt; APPARENTLY, THE DEPOSIT'S

14:51.857 --> 14:55.995
{\an1}NONREFUNDABLE.

14:56.061 --> 14:57.863
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SO, HAS ANYONE REVEALED

14:57.930 --> 14:58.864
{\an1}A SECRET TO ANYONE

14:58.931 --> 15:00.899
{\an1}OTHER THAN THEIR PARTNER?

15:00.966 --> 15:02.001
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO.

15:02.067 --> 15:02.568
{\an1}&gt;&gt; VERY GOOD.

15:02.635 --> 15:03.535
{\an1}NOW, WOULD ANYONE BE INTERESTED

15:03.602 --> 15:04.637
{\an1}IN SELLING THEIR PARTNER'S

15:04.703 --> 15:07.539
{\an1}SECRET FOR $1,000?

15:07.606 --> 15:08.173
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I WILL.

15:08.240 --> 15:08.941
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DON'T--

15:09.008 --> 15:12.244
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THIS GUY HAS NEVER EVER--

15:12.311 --> 15:13.379
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NEVER EVER WHAT?

15:13.445 --> 15:13.912
{\an1}OH, IT WAS JUST

15:13.979 --> 15:15.114
{\an1}STARTING TO GET INTERESTING.

15:15.180 --> 15:17.216
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HERE, HAVE A MINT.

15:17.283 --> 15:17.850
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OUR YOUNG FRIEND WAS

15:17.916 --> 15:19.652
{\an1}JUST VERY LUCKY BECAUSE

15:19.718 --> 15:20.853
{\an1}SHOULD ANY OF YOU REVEAL

15:20.919 --> 15:21.920
{\an1}YOUR PARTNER'S SECRET,

15:21.987 --> 15:23.422
{\an1}THEN YOU WOULD BE FORCED

15:23.489 --> 15:27.026
{\an1}TO SIT IN THE CHAIR OF SHAME.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.193
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO.

15:28.260 --> 15:28.661
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT THE--

15:28.727 --> 15:30.429
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MAX.

15:30.496 --> 15:31.897
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY--

15:31.964 --> 15:33.232
{\an1}HE CAME HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

15:33.299 --> 15:34.333
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, RELAX PEOPLE.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.769
{\an1}THE SPIKES ARE NOT REAL.

15:36.835 --> 15:37.469
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT.

15:37.536 --> 15:40.205
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THE COCONUTS, HOWEVER, ARE!

15:40.272 --> 15:41.740
{\an1}&gt;&gt; UH-OH!

15:41.807 --> 15:42.308
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S TIME

15:42.374 --> 15:45.077
{\an1}FOR ANOTHER EXERCISE.

15:45.144 --> 15:48.213
{\an1}A GAME OF CAPTURE THE FLAG.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.683
{\an1}FRONT ROW VERSUS THE BACK ROW.

15:50.749 --> 15:51.417
{\an1}FRONT ROW, YOUR HOME BASE

15:51.483 --> 15:52.451
{\an1}WILL BE TRUE'S OFFICE,

15:52.518 --> 15:53.686
{\an1}BACK ROW, YOUR HOME BASE

15:53.752 --> 15:55.254
{\an1}WILL BE THE BREAK ROOM.

15:55.321 --> 15:56.155
{\an1}YOU ALL KNOW THE RULES.

15:56.221 --> 15:57.189
{\an1}IF AN OPPOSING PLAYER GETS

15:57.256 --> 15:58.557
{\an1}TWO HANDS ON YOUR SHOULDERS,

15:58.624 --> 15:59.491
{\an1}YOU'RE OUT.

15:59.558 --> 16:02.127
{\an1}QUESTIONS?

16:02.194 --> 16:02.995
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT IF I HAD THE BANK PUT

16:03.062 --> 16:04.396
{\an1}A STOP PAYMENT ON THE CHECK?

16:04.463 --> 16:04.863
{\an1}DO YOU SUPPOSE

16:04.930 --> 16:13.605
{\an1}THERE'D BE A PENALTY?

16:13.672 --> 16:15.941
{\an1}&gt;&gt; QUIET OUT THERE.

16:16.008 --> 16:18.043
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TOO QUIET.

16:18.110 --> 16:20.045
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO.

16:20.112 --> 16:20.846
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW

16:20.913 --> 16:21.814
{\an1}WHAT THAT MONKEY JUST DID

16:21.880 --> 16:26.352
{\an1}IN OSCAR'S COFFEE MUG.

16:26.418 --> 16:26.885
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OKAY, WE CAN'T

16:26.952 --> 16:28.320
{\an1}JUST PLAY DEFENSE.

16:28.387 --> 16:28.854
{\an1}WE'VE GOT TO SEND

16:28.921 --> 16:33.826
{\an1}SOMEBODY OUT THERE.

16:33.892 --> 16:37.329
{\an1}&gt;&gt; GOOD IDEA. HOW ABOUT YOU?

16:37.396 --> 16:38.964
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, I DON'T KNOW IF I'M

16:39.031 --> 16:40.232
{\an1}VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THAT.

16:40.299 --> 16:40.766
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU'LL BE FINE.

16:40.833 --> 16:41.433
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, I THINK I SHOULD

16:41.500 --> 16:42.568
{\an1}ACTUALLY JUST STAY IN HERE.

16:42.634 --> 16:43.669
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, TRUST ME. TRUST ME.

16:43.736 --> 16:44.236
{\an1}NOTHING'S GOING

16:44.303 --> 16:49.475
{\an1}TO HAPPEN TO YOU.

16:49.541 --> 16:53.479
{\an1}AND HE'S CAPTURED.

16:53.545 --> 16:54.480
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT'S WRONG, LULU?

16:54.546 --> 16:55.914
{\an1}YOU SEEM JUMPY.

16:55.981 --> 16:57.216
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT'S MR. MADIGAN'S SECRET.

16:57.282 --> 16:58.550
{\an1}IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY.

16:58.617 --> 16:59.118
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO KNOW

16:59.184 --> 16:59.785
{\an1}THIS GUY'S SECRET?

16:59.852 --> 17:00.352
{\an1}HE'S NEVER--

17:00.419 --> 17:03.522
{\an1}[SCREAM]

17:03.589 --> 17:04.690
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IF YOU WANT TO TELL ME,

17:04.757 --> 17:06.992
{\an1}JUST TELL ME.

17:07.059 --> 17:07.693
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I WANT TO, BUT I'M

17:07.760 --> 17:09.627
{\an1}NOT SUPPOSED TO.

17:09.694 --> 17:10.396
{\an1}ON THE OTHER HAND,

17:10.462 --> 17:10.963
{\an1}IF I DON'T TELL YOU,

17:11.029 --> 17:12.397
{\an1}I'LL EXPLODE.

17:12.464 --> 17:13.265
{\an1}BUT THEN, IF I DO TELL YOU,

17:13.332 --> 17:13.898
{\an1}HE'LL MAKE ME SIT

17:13.965 --> 17:15.166
{\an1}IN THAT CRAZY CHAIR.

17:15.233 --> 17:19.838
{\an1}&gt;&gt; JUST TELL ME.

17:19.905 --> 17:24.542
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO DO WHAT NOW?

17:24.609 --> 17:26.678
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HERE YOU ARE.

17:26.744 --> 17:28.313
{\an1}I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.

17:28.380 --> 17:31.016
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I GOT CAPTURED.

17:31.083 --> 17:31.683
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I JUST WANT TO SAY

17:31.750 --> 17:33.185
{\an1}THAT I LOVE WORKING HERE SO MUCH

17:33.252 --> 17:34.420
{\an1}AND I'D HATE FOR ANYTHING

17:34.486 --> 17:35.921
{\an1}TO BE DIFFERENT.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.089
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LULU TOLD YOU.

17:37.156 --> 17:41.894
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO. NO, NO, NO. WELL, YES.

17:41.960 --> 17:42.594
{\an1}HOW COULD YOU EVER THINK

17:42.661 --> 17:45.798
{\an1}ABOUT SELLING THE COMPANY?

17:45.864 --> 17:46.632
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DID YOU EVER FEEL LIKE

17:46.698 --> 17:47.132
{\an1}YOU WEREN'T SURE

17:47.199 --> 17:48.767
{\an1}WHAT YOU WERE DOING?

17:48.834 --> 17:49.268
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU'RE ASKING

17:49.334 --> 17:50.035
{\an1}A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL

17:50.102 --> 17:51.036
{\an1}WHO'S VICE PRESIDENT

17:51.103 --> 17:54.807
{\an1}OF A FASHION COMPANY.

17:54.873 --> 17:56.241
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'M IN A RUT.

17:56.308 --> 17:57.342
{\an1}I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH IDEAS

17:57.409 --> 17:58.243
{\an1}FOR A NEW LINE,

17:58.310 --> 17:59.578
{\an1}AND NOTHING'S COMING.

17:59.645 --> 18:00.712
{\an1}AND IT GOT ME THINKING,

18:00.779 --> 18:01.413
{\an1}WHO EVEN CARES

18:01.480 --> 18:03.449
{\an1}IF I DESIGN ANOTHER LINE?

18:03.515 --> 18:04.716
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LOTS OF PEOPLE.

18:04.783 --> 18:05.350
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THAT

18:05.417 --> 18:07.252
{\an1}AWFUL HORSE STATUE I HAVE?

18:07.319 --> 18:07.986
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT YOU LOVED IT?

18:08.053 --> 18:08.821
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, NO.

18:08.887 --> 18:09.555
{\an1}IT'S HORRIBLY TACKY.

18:09.621 --> 18:11.190
{\an1}BUT, IT WAS THE ONLY THING

18:11.256 --> 18:12.958
{\an1}IN THIS OFFICE WHEN I MOVED IN.

18:13.025 --> 18:13.992
{\an1}SOMEHOW IT SEEMED POETIC

18:14.059 --> 18:15.727
{\an1}TO LEAVE IT THERE.

18:15.794 --> 18:16.261
{\an1}BUT THEN I CAME IN

18:16.328 --> 18:17.429
{\an1}AND IT WAS DESTROYED.

18:17.496 --> 18:19.898
{\an1}I FIGURED IT WAS A SIGN.

18:19.965 --> 18:21.533
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DO YOU BELIEVE IN SIGNS?

18:21.600 --> 18:22.701
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DO.

18:22.768 --> 18:23.335
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, LET ME TELL YOU

18:23.402 --> 18:25.037
{\an1}ABOUT A SIGN.

18:25.103 --> 18:26.338
{\an1}WHEN I WAS 10 YEARS OLD,

18:26.405 --> 18:26.939
{\an1}THERE WAS A BILLBOARD

18:27.005 --> 18:29.408
{\an1}ON OUR CORNER-- FOR MAD STYLE.

18:29.475 --> 18:30.409
{\an1}IT HAD A PICTURE WITH A LADY

18:30.476 --> 18:31.810
{\an1}IN A BROWN DRESS ON,

18:31.877 --> 18:32.945
{\an1}WITH PINK STITCHING

18:33.011 --> 18:34.313
{\an1}AND ORANGE BUTTONS.

18:34.379 --> 18:35.614
{\an1}THOSE ARE MY FAVORITE COLORS,

18:35.681 --> 18:37.649
{\an1}PINK, ORANGE, AND BROWN.

18:37.716 --> 18:39.585
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I REMEMBER THAT DRESS.

18:39.651 --> 18:40.853
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'D NEVER SEEN A DRS

18:40.919 --> 18:42.321
{\an1}LIKE THAT BEFORE.

18:42.387 --> 18:42.721
{\an1}I MUST'VE

18:42.788 --> 18:43.755
{\an1}LOOKED UP AT THAT SIGN

18:43.822 --> 18:46.325
{\an1}A THOUSAND TIMES.

18:46.391 --> 18:48.494
{\an1}YOU INSPIRED ME, MR. MADIGAN.

18:48.560 --> 18:51.330
{\an1}YOU GAVE ME SOMETHING.

18:51.396 --> 18:51.930
{\an1}I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK

18:51.997 --> 18:52.931
{\an1}THERE'S A 10-YEAR-OLD GIRL

18:52.998 --> 18:54.333
{\an1}OUT THERE RIGHT NOW

18:54.399 --> 18:58.437
{\an1}LOOKING UP AT A BILLBOARD.

18:58.504 --> 19:02.875
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

19:02.941 --> 19:04.743
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

19:04.810 --> 19:05.477
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TRUE WAS HELPING ME FIND

19:05.544 --> 19:06.912
{\an1}SOMETHING I'D LOST.

19:06.979 --> 19:07.746
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WAS IT YOUR HORSE STATUE?

19:07.813 --> 19:09.047
{\an1}WERE YOU TALKING

19:09.114 --> 19:10.082
{\an1}ABOUT YOUR HORSE STATUE?

19:10.148 --> 19:11.149
{\an1}&gt;&gt; GAME OVER.

19:11.216 --> 19:13.051
{\an1}ALL PLAYERS PLEASE RETURN

19:13.118 --> 19:15.354
{\an1}TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

19:15.420 --> 19:18.524
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THIS GUY.

19:18.590 --> 19:19.424
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, TRUE

19:19.491 --> 19:19.992
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH.

19:20.058 --> 19:20.492
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WE MIGHT WANT

19:20.559 --> 19:21.493
{\an1}TO START GIVING LULU A LITTLE

19:21.560 --> 19:22.761
{\an1}MORE RESPONSIBILITY.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.097
{\an1}I THINK SHE'S READY FOR IT.

19:25.163 --> 19:32.771
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OKAY.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.373
{\an1}&gt;&gt; FIRST, LET ME CONGRATULATE

19:34.439 --> 19:35.474
{\an1}THE WINNING TEAM.

19:35.541 --> 19:36.341
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHO WAS IT?

19:36.408 --> 19:37.576
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO ONE.

19:37.643 --> 19:38.377
{\an1}THAT WAS THE MOST BORING GAME

19:38.443 --> 19:39.077
{\an1}OF CAPTURE THE FLAG

19:39.144 --> 19:40.312
{\an1}I'VE EVER WITNESSED.

19:40.379 --> 19:41.213
{\an1}DO NOT GIVE YOURSELVES

19:41.280 --> 19:44.783
{\an1}A ROUND OF APPLAUSE.

19:44.850 --> 19:45.884
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT DID I JUST SAY?

19:45.951 --> 19:46.385
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW.

19:46.451 --> 19:46.785
{\an1}I'M PRETTY

19:46.852 --> 19:49.988
{\an1}CHECKED OUT HERE, TED.

19:50.055 --> 19:51.290
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SECONDLY, AND MOST

19:51.356 --> 19:52.591
{\an1}IMPORTANTLY, HAS ANYONE REVEALED

19:52.658 --> 19:55.160
{\an1}THEIR PARTNER'S SECRET?

19:55.227 --> 19:56.295
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO.

19:56.361 --> 19:59.665
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DID.

19:59.731 --> 20:00.265
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THEN I'M AFRAID

20:00.332 --> 20:07.272
{\an1}THE CHAIR AWAITS.

{\an1}&gt;&gt; TELL ME, DO YOU BY ANY CHANCE

20:08.106 --> 20:10.008

20:10.075 --> 20:11.510
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO.

20:11.577 --> 20:13.412
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU WILL.

20:13.478 --> 20:16.682
{\an1}I'M JOKING.

20:16.748 --> 20:17.783
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HEY TRUE, I HEAR YOU HAVE

20:17.849 --> 20:19.117
{\an1}A CRUSH ON SOMEONE.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.119

20:24.590 --> 20:24.957
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT WAS MY

20:25.023 --> 20:26.158
{\an1}CLUMSY ASSISTANT'S FAULT.

20:26.224 --> 20:26.892
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S A LIE!

20:26.959 --> 20:27.593
{\an1}I'M HER SISTER!

20:27.659 --> 20:28.794
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DON'T EAT ANY MORE MINTS!

20:28.860 --> 20:29.561
{\an1}SHE'S TRYING TO DRIVE YOU MAD.

20:29.628 --> 20:30.529
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THIS GUY'S

20:30.596 --> 20:32.864

{\an1}IN BUSINESS,

20:46.678 --> 20:48.947
