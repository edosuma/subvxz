01:18.837 --> 01:19.907
All right, gentlemen.

01:19.907 --> 01:21.150
88, you're so damn late

01:21.150 --> 01:22.841
I don't even know why
you bothered to show up.

01:22.841 --> 01:25.464
Over there, probie.

01:25.464 --> 01:27.121
Gotta wake up pretty
early in the morning

01:27.121 --> 01:28.398
if you want to beat 19.

01:28.398 --> 01:30.297
Yeah. We'll give you a chance to
catch up next--

01:30.297 --> 01:31.919
Wait, nah!

01:31.919 --> 01:34.163
You gotta keep up
today, boys.

01:34.163 --> 01:36.234
We like a little competition
with our morning coffee.

01:36.234 --> 01:37.925
Welcome to live fire training
today, folks.

01:37.925 --> 01:39.754
We're going to do
three simulations.

01:39.754 --> 01:41.687
Don't forget the conditions
are controlled,

01:41.687 --> 01:43.965
but the fire is very real.

01:43.965 --> 01:45.346
You'll be racing the clock
and each other

01:45.346 --> 01:48.970
with a goal to achieve
better communication and unity.

01:48.970 --> 01:50.869
Today we'll be focusing
on the three R's.

01:50.869 --> 01:52.491
What are the three R's,
Herrera?

01:52.491 --> 01:53.941
The three R's--
reading critical cues,

01:53.941 --> 01:55.149
recognizing patterns,

01:55.149 --> 01:57.117
and reacting with
the best course of action.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.290
That is correct.

01:58.290 --> 01:59.533
Phase one was response time.

01:59.533 --> 02:01.776
19 responded first--
well done.

02:01.776 --> 02:03.951
Lieutenant,
put 'em to work.

02:03.951 --> 02:06.126
All right,
19, let's get busy.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.679
Grab those materials
off of Cap's truck

02:07.679 --> 02:09.163
and let's get hot and dirty.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.613
Hot and dirty.

02:10.613 --> 02:12.856
- Yeah, you know what I mean.
- I know what you mean.

02:12.856 --> 02:14.444
I thought I trained you
better than this.

02:14.444 --> 02:17.171
You did, which is why
I'm a lieutenant now, Cap.

02:17.171 --> 02:18.793
Get out. Well done.

02:18.793 --> 02:20.036
I remember when you were
just a probie.

02:20.036 --> 02:21.348
I was the best probie
you ever had.

02:21.348 --> 02:22.901
Nah, you were a mess.

02:22.901 --> 02:24.834
You fell down the fire pole,
we had to call your mom.

02:24.834 --> 02:26.215
Tell you what,
once these kids

02:26.215 --> 02:28.458
unload everything,
why don't you meet me inside?

02:28.458 --> 02:29.356
You can help me set up.

02:31.565 --> 02:34.706
Wait, you went through your
probation months with Beckett?

02:34.706 --> 02:36.156
I feel sorry for you.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.640
I can't imagine a worse
probie phase than serving

02:37.640 --> 02:39.331
under Captain Breath mint.

02:39.331 --> 02:40.401
What do you mean?

02:40.401 --> 02:42.196
He was the best captain
I ever had.

02:42.196 --> 02:43.059
Take this hose, probie.

02:45.613 --> 02:48.237
Hey, Cooper, you coming?

02:48.237 --> 02:49.686
By the way...
Huh?

02:49.686 --> 02:51.826
...you guys aren't
winning the next phases.

02:51.826 --> 02:54.277
Ooh, we are gonna wipe
the floor with these fools.

02:57.591 --> 02:59.558
Hey, can you cover me
at desk duty for a sec?

02:59.558 --> 03:02.216
Uh, pretty sure
I'm already on desk duty.

03:02.216 --> 03:03.666
I'm covering for Montgomery.

03:03.666 --> 03:05.254
Well, it's my first day back,
and I'm only approved

03:05.254 --> 03:06.496
for desk dut-- You know what?
It doesn't matter.

03:06.496 --> 03:07.325
I-I'll be right back.

03:07.325 --> 03:09.189
Where you goin'?

03:09.189 --> 03:11.605
An errand I have to run.

03:11.605 --> 03:13.123
An errand while on shift?

03:13.123 --> 03:15.540
An errand where I try
to convince my wife to love

03:15.540 --> 03:18.094
and forgive me through bribery
and a delicious savory dish

03:18.094 --> 03:19.889
that I woke up
at the crack of dawn to cook.

03:19.889 --> 03:21.511
Uh-huh. I approve.

03:21.511 --> 03:23.237
Go.

03:26.344 --> 03:27.621
Where are we?
Andy's place.

03:27.621 --> 03:29.036
This Andy's apartment?
Yeah.

03:29.036 --> 03:30.555
You said we needed
somewhere quiet.

03:30.555 --> 03:31.901
They're doing endless
construction on my block.

03:31.901 --> 03:32.936
She said we could
use her place,

03:32.936 --> 03:33.868
but now I think
we should leave

03:33.868 --> 03:35.905
before I throw up
or crap my pants

03:35.905 --> 03:37.251
- and ruin her nice gesture.
- Okay.

03:37.251 --> 03:38.873
You take a deep breathe so you
do neither of those things.

03:38.873 --> 03:40.254
It's live radio.
I'm aware.

03:40.254 --> 03:41.531
It's a live radio
press junket.

03:41.531 --> 03:43.119
Yes, I spent a fair bit of time
setting it up.

03:43.119 --> 03:44.707
Right.
And I'm a firefighter,

03:44.707 --> 03:46.260
and there's
a whole third candidate--

03:46.260 --> 03:47.468
Councilmember Robel Osman.

03:47.468 --> 03:48.297
Did you hear that?

03:48.297 --> 03:49.470
Councilmember.

03:49.470 --> 03:51.058
As in, knows
what they're doing

03:51.058 --> 03:52.473
and has won
an election before.

03:52.473 --> 03:54.372
You are also
a proper mayoral candidate

03:54.372 --> 03:56.063
in your own right,

03:56.063 --> 03:58.548
and it's high time that
Seattle learned your name.

03:58.548 --> 04:00.309
Or rather, the entire
Pacific Northwest.

04:00.309 --> 04:01.655
And I'm back
to crapping my pants.

04:01.655 --> 04:03.553
Travis, you were born
for this.

04:03.553 --> 04:05.072
Say more stuff.

04:05.072 --> 04:07.799
You're charming, you're funny,
you care deeply,

04:07.799 --> 04:09.939
and you are excellent

04:09.939 --> 04:11.596
at articulating the things
that matter to you

04:11.596 --> 04:13.563
when you're not
distracting yourself

04:13.563 --> 04:15.185
with the idea
that you're not good enough.

04:15.185 --> 04:17.464
You'll be great, if you remember
that this isn't about you.

04:17.464 --> 04:18.948
It's not about me.

04:18.948 --> 04:20.501
It's about the good and
hard-working people

04:20.501 --> 04:22.262
in the city of Seattle
who deserve real change.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.297
Right.
Yes.

04:23.297 --> 04:24.850
You should be
a motivational speaker.

04:24.850 --> 04:26.576
Yeah. But I'm not.
You know why?

04:26.576 --> 04:28.198
Because you're
my campaign manager.

04:28.198 --> 04:29.338
There it is.

04:34.446 --> 04:36.310
Oh, uh,
am I interrupting?

04:36.310 --> 04:39.209
Sorry, I ran out of toothpaste
at the hotel,

04:39.209 --> 04:40.418
so I grabbed some
on my way in.

04:40.418 --> 04:41.833
But my water bottle
was empty.

04:41.833 --> 04:43.524
It's just been
one of those days.

04:43.524 --> 04:45.630
I'm sorry to hear
you're still at a hotel.

04:47.908 --> 04:48.943
Ew.

04:48.943 --> 04:50.324
Sorry, I used
to love room service.

04:50.324 --> 04:51.601
Now it tastes like heartbreak.

04:51.601 --> 04:53.500
Even the fries?

04:53.500 --> 04:55.536
Except for the fries.

04:55.536 --> 04:57.814
What can I do for you,
Dr. Bailey?

04:57.814 --> 05:01.542
Have you thought more
about volunteering

05:01.542 --> 05:03.510
additional hours
at my clinic?

05:03.510 --> 05:06.133
Is it still called volunteering
if you're forcing me to do it?

05:06.133 --> 05:08.480
Okay, the station's clinic
can survive

05:08.480 --> 05:12.312
without you
for a few shifts.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.383
Uh, does your husband know
you're trying to recruit me

05:14.383 --> 05:16.005
away from Station 19?

05:16.005 --> 05:17.386
You are an OB. Yeah.

05:17.386 --> 05:19.215
I run a reproductive
rights clinic.

05:19.215 --> 05:20.250
- This is a no-brainer.
- Okay.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.838
So that's a no.

05:21.838 --> 05:23.323
Ben will understand.

05:23.323 --> 05:27.188
We need to be open
longer hours, okay?

05:27.188 --> 05:29.018
And it's not me asking.

05:29.018 --> 05:31.400
It's the women who need us asking.

05:31.400 --> 05:34.092
The women who drive
long hours

05:34.092 --> 05:36.577
from abortion-hostile
states...
Oh, God.

05:36.577 --> 05:39.477
...that need us to open
our doors when they arrive.

05:39.477 --> 05:40.581
That is so manipulative.

05:40.581 --> 05:42.238
These are facts.

05:42.238 --> 05:43.860
Ugh. Come in.

05:44.689 --> 05:46.207
Hi, oh.

05:46.207 --> 05:48.071
I, uh, hope
I'm not interrupting.

05:48.071 --> 05:50.660
Uh, I brought you
something special.

05:50.660 --> 05:52.697
It's lasagna.

05:55.078 --> 05:59.393
Okay, it's not as good
as yours...

05:59.393 --> 06:01.706
but I hope you like it.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.193
It looks delicious, Maya.

06:06.193 --> 06:09.299
You can't just storm in here
with lasagna, Maya.

06:09.299 --> 06:11.440
You can't. I'm at work--I can.

06:11.440 --> 06:16.514
So I did because I love you,
and now I am leaving.

06:16.514 --> 06:17.929
Bye.

06:20.138 --> 06:22.520
- What?
- Eat the lasagna.

06:22.520 --> 06:23.452
No.
You're having one

06:23.452 --> 06:25.212
of those days, you said.

06:25.212 --> 06:26.524
And the woman you love

06:26.524 --> 06:29.768
just brought you lasagna.

06:29.768 --> 06:31.805
And even though you're
still angry enough

06:31.805 --> 06:33.738
to live in a hotel
and eat food

06:33.738 --> 06:36.223
that tastes
like heartbreak,

06:36.223 --> 06:39.537
eat the lasagna
your wife brought you.

06:39.537 --> 06:42.402
It might just turn
your whole day around.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.680
Ugh, um, think about
what I said.

06:46.923 --> 06:48.580
Okay. I'll bother you
some more later.

06:52.653 --> 06:54.448
Next phase is timed runs.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.312
19 goes first, then 88.

06:56.312 --> 06:58.970
The clock stops when all fires
are contained

06:58.970 --> 07:00.834
and you evacuate
the victim.

07:02.629 --> 07:03.940
Fire's out.
Room's clear.

07:03.940 --> 07:05.183
Copy that.

07:05.183 --> 07:07.081
The interior of this place
is like a maze.

07:07.081 --> 07:10.015
Don't get lost and become
an actual rescue.

07:10.015 --> 07:12.432
Pick it up, 88.
You're falling behind.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.158
- Keep up, probie, okay?
- Uh-huh.

07:15.158 --> 07:18.265
Stay alert in there
and don't get cocky.

07:18.265 --> 07:20.819
Fire department, call out!

07:20.819 --> 07:23.581
Yeah.
Yeah, dummy, where are you?

07:23.581 --> 07:25.962
I hope you're taking
this seriously, 19.

07:29.103 --> 07:32.141
Don't forget to communicate.
Communication is key.

07:36.179 --> 07:37.215
Room is clear, Lieutenant.

07:38.388 --> 07:41.046
Lt. Cooper?

07:41.046 --> 07:43.186
88, we've still got fires
on the north side.

07:43.186 --> 07:46.189
Please put them out before
the place burns down.

07:46.189 --> 07:47.190
Lt. Cooper?

07:47.190 --> 07:48.813
- Do you copy?
- Sir?

07:48.813 --> 07:50.400
88, do you copy?

07:53.852 --> 07:55.405
Captain!

07:55.405 --> 07:57.373
Captain,
I think I got lost.

07:57.373 --> 07:59.202
Keep going, probie.

07:59.202 --> 08:00.790
19, give me eyes.

08:00.790 --> 08:02.551
Another fire
on the lower level.

08:08.902 --> 08:10.006
Fire's out!

08:10.006 --> 08:12.077
Okay, well done,
19, fire attack.

08:12.077 --> 08:14.977
Search and rescue, your victims
have been in there way too long.

08:14.977 --> 08:17.186
- Herrera, back corner!
- Search faster.

08:18.532 --> 08:22.260
Nice.

08:22.260 --> 08:23.537
19 search and rescue,

08:23.537 --> 08:25.574
we've located your victim.

08:28.059 --> 08:30.440
Hey.

08:30.440 --> 08:34.548
Did you, uh, work it out
with Carina?

08:34.548 --> 08:35.722
Take that as a no.

08:37.309 --> 08:38.656
- Jack.
- Oh, Brooke.

08:38.656 --> 08:40.105
Holy crap.

08:40.105 --> 08:42.522
Cool, you're here.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.006
Who's Brooke?

08:44.006 --> 08:46.387
Oh, she's my, uh--I'm his long lost sister.

08:46.387 --> 08:47.699
- Yeah.
- Seriously?

08:48.873 --> 08:49.874
What happened?

08:49.874 --> 08:51.703
This is my friend Clara.

08:51.703 --> 08:53.256
'Sup, bro?

08:53.256 --> 08:54.464
I told her about you.

08:54.464 --> 08:55.465
What happened?

08:55.465 --> 08:57.744
Motorcycle accident?

08:57.744 --> 08:59.849
We kinda got in a fight
with some asphalt.

08:59.849 --> 09:02.542
Good news is
we were wearing helmets.

09:11.309 --> 09:12.482
Ah. Here we go.

09:12.482 --> 09:14.623
There they are.

09:14.623 --> 09:16.314
What was our time, Cap?

09:16.314 --> 09:17.729
I want to know how bad
we beat 19.

09:17.729 --> 09:19.386
Oh, you got
to be kidding.

09:19.386 --> 09:21.146
Oh, come on.
You guys were in there forever.

09:21.146 --> 09:22.734
Yeah, I just took
a little nap.

09:22.734 --> 09:24.564
Yeah. She was snoring
and everything.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.565
All right, 19,
you wanna laugh?

09:25.565 --> 09:27.774
Herrera, come here.

09:27.774 --> 09:30.259
Read these times out loud
for the class.

09:30.259 --> 09:33.296
Let's see, uh, it took 19
11 minutes to contain the fire

09:33.296 --> 09:34.988
and find the victim.

09:34.988 --> 09:37.231
And 88, nine minutes.

09:37.231 --> 09:38.578
What?!

09:38.578 --> 09:39.924
Way to go, 88.

09:39.924 --> 09:41.581
Please share notes
with each other

09:41.581 --> 09:43.410
on where to improve
areas of weakness.

09:43.410 --> 09:44.722
And who knows, Cooper,
maybe you could teach my team

09:44.722 --> 09:46.447
a thing or two.

09:46.447 --> 09:48.760
Yeah, we'll get you
on the next one, 88.

09:50.382 --> 09:53.593
You know, Beckett is still
a bit of a dick,

09:53.593 --> 09:56.630
but we finally get to see
a lighter side of him.

09:56.630 --> 09:59.150
Who knew all we had to do was
bring him around old friends?

09:59.150 --> 10:01.911
Maybe he'll bring back
some of that same energy to 19.

10:01.911 --> 10:03.603
Maybe.
Come on.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.846
Look, if we're stuck
with Beckett,

10:05.846 --> 10:07.917
it better be this Beckett.

10:10.126 --> 10:12.335
We were riding in between lanes
to cut traffic

10:12.335 --> 10:14.337
'cause this old guy in front
of us was driving like--

10:14.337 --> 10:16.132
So slow you can't even
call it driving.

10:16.132 --> 10:18.548
And then another car
tried to merge, didn't see us.

10:18.548 --> 10:21.310
So I swerved and fishtailed
in some gravel.

10:21.310 --> 10:23.623
It is kind of bad ass
until it wasn't.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.554
Does it hurt
when I move it like this?

10:24.554 --> 10:26.453
A little!

10:26.453 --> 10:28.766
Okay. You know,
it looks swollen.

10:28.766 --> 10:32.148
Nah, just my, uh,
unusually thick ankles.

10:32.148 --> 10:33.391
They run in the family.

10:33.391 --> 10:34.772
Actually, you know what,
let me see your ankles.

10:34.772 --> 10:36.049
Could be sprained,
could be broken.

10:36.049 --> 10:37.326
We're not gonna know
until we get an X-Ray.

10:37.326 --> 10:39.328
Yeah, and a CT scan
to check for head trauma.

10:39.328 --> 10:41.364
Okay, slow down.

10:41.364 --> 10:43.366
Well, she's right. We need
to get you to a hospital.

10:43.366 --> 10:44.816
Yeah. Not happening.

10:44.816 --> 10:46.576
And why not?

10:46.576 --> 10:49.890
Because lane splitting
is super illegal in this state.

10:49.890 --> 10:50.891
And I don't need
some E.R. doctor

10:50.891 --> 10:52.065
narcing me out to the cops.

10:52.065 --> 10:53.066
They won't.

10:53.066 --> 10:54.067
Not taking that chance.

10:54.067 --> 10:55.344
Fine.

10:55.344 --> 10:57.139
You can stay.

10:57.139 --> 11:00.073
But you're going,
because you weren't driving.

11:00.073 --> 11:03.007
I am still on Mom
and Dad's insurance,

11:03.007 --> 11:04.871
and if they see I went to the
hospital, they'll ask questions.

11:04.871 --> 11:06.804
It is not worth your safety
and well-being

11:06.804 --> 11:08.806
to not get checked out.

11:08.806 --> 11:10.014
You'll think of something.

11:10.014 --> 11:11.532
We're going.

11:11.532 --> 11:13.500
Damn, I thought you said
your brother was chill.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.846
I thought he was.

11:14.846 --> 11:16.848
He is,
but it's not his call.

11:16.848 --> 11:18.229
I'm the lieutenant,
and I'm insisting

11:18.229 --> 11:19.368
that you go to the hospital.

11:19.368 --> 11:20.610
We can't.

11:20.610 --> 11:21.853
Why?

11:23.717 --> 11:26.444
We had candy beforehand,

11:26.444 --> 11:29.412
hours before.

11:29.412 --> 11:30.655
So?

11:32.657 --> 11:34.590
Pot candy.

11:34.590 --> 11:36.109
Edibles.

11:39.250 --> 11:41.459
<i>So how are you
going to make the lives</i>

11:41.459 --> 11:43.530
<i>of citizens in Seattle
better as mayor?</i>

11:43.530 --> 11:45.463
Uh, well, to start with,

11:45.463 --> 11:47.189
we could make sure
every homeless person

11:47.189 --> 11:48.638
has a clean new needle
for drugs every day.

11:48.638 --> 11:52.608
<i>I'm sorry. What was that?</i>

11:52.608 --> 11:53.747
No, yes.

11:53.747 --> 11:56.439
I-I mean--
what I mean is--

11:56.439 --> 11:58.441
they're gonna get needles
from somewhere.

11:58.441 --> 12:00.789
They may as well be safe ones
from the government.

12:00.789 --> 12:03.274
<i>Are you suggesting that
more hard-earned tax dollars</i>

12:03.274 --> 12:05.103
<i>should be used to fund
and enable drug use</i>

12:05.103 --> 12:06.311
<i>and addiction in the streets?</i>

12:06.311 --> 12:09.142
HIV is up 6% higher
in cities

12:09.142 --> 12:10.902
without a needle-exchange
program.

12:10.902 --> 12:12.870
Wi-Without it,
blood-borne diseases

12:12.870 --> 12:14.734
would run rampant
through the city,

12:14.734 --> 12:16.390
affecting millions of people,

12:16.390 --> 12:20.498
including those who are lucky
enough to wake up every morning

12:20.498 --> 12:21.879
and not be struggling
with addiction,

12:21.879 --> 12:23.156
who don't have
to choose between

12:23.156 --> 12:25.745
worrying about withdrawal
or starvation.

12:25.745 --> 12:26.815
It's--
It's really not about

12:26.815 --> 12:28.782
how I can make
your lives better.

12:28.782 --> 12:33.442
It's about how we can help
each other live better lives.

12:35.824 --> 12:38.585
We're part of a very
delicate chain reaction.

12:38.585 --> 12:41.070
We can't escape it.

12:41.070 --> 12:43.797
We can only work together
to try to strengthen it.

12:46.973 --> 12:49.527
<i>Our switchboards and
social media are lighting up.</i>

12:49.527 --> 12:51.978
<i>Looks like people are dying
to weigh in on this.</i>

12:51.978 --> 12:54.359
<i>After the break, we'll open
it up to listener questions.</i>

12:54.359 --> 12:55.844
<i>It's been a real pleasure
talking with</i>

12:55.844 --> 12:57.431
<i>mayoral candidate
Travis Montgomery.</i>

12:57.431 --> 12:58.674
Thank you so much.

12:58.674 --> 13:00.469
Oh!
Oh!

13:00.469 --> 13:01.608
Where did that come from?

13:01.608 --> 13:02.609
I don't know. My word!

13:02.609 --> 13:04.162
Okay, okay, enough dancing.

13:04.162 --> 13:05.957
Three-minute pee break
before the next segment.

13:05.957 --> 13:06.993
I do have to pee.
You do.

13:06.993 --> 13:08.511
Okay.

13:11.860 --> 13:14.034
Pfft! Beckett's playing favorites.

13:14.034 --> 13:15.139
He's your captain.

13:15.139 --> 13:16.830
Yeah, but you were
his probie.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.556
Y'all are just jealous
that we're obviously

13:18.556 --> 13:19.799
the better firehouse.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.836
- Don't make me laugh.
- Ha-ha.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.838
All right, let's make
this interesting.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.391
Joe's--
tomorrow after shift.

13:26.391 --> 13:29.360
Whichever team has the worst
overall time buys the rounds.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.017
All right, but you're not
getting any special treatment

13:31.017 --> 13:32.466
'cause you have a probie.

13:32.466 --> 13:34.158
We should be focused on
giving our best performance

13:34.158 --> 13:35.573
and learning how
to improve, all right?

13:35.573 --> 13:37.299
We all have
the same goals here.

13:37.299 --> 13:40.164
If you're scared you can't cover
the tab, just say so, Warren.

13:40.164 --> 13:41.406
Oh, so it's like that?

13:41.406 --> 13:42.511
'Cause you know I got
that doctor money.

13:42.511 --> 13:44.030
Ohh!

13:44.030 --> 13:45.341
Keep talking, Cooper.

13:45.341 --> 13:46.895
It's gonna be funny
when you guys lose.

13:46.895 --> 13:48.758
Eh, as long as Beckett
keeps it fair.

13:48.758 --> 13:50.174
What's he normally like?

13:50.174 --> 13:52.832
Uh, even without his
breath mints, he's an ass.

13:52.832 --> 13:53.763
But I actually
haven't seen him

13:53.763 --> 13:55.179
with his breath mints
lately, so...

13:55.179 --> 13:58.182
Probie, did I say
you could talk?

13:58.182 --> 14:00.494
No, sir.

14:00.494 --> 14:03.670
Cooper, set up again.

14:03.670 --> 14:05.085
Sure thing, Cap.

14:05.914 --> 14:07.501
Teacher's pet.

14:07.501 --> 14:10.332
Brooke, do you know
how many brains

14:10.332 --> 14:11.678
we've had to scrape off
the side of the road

14:11.678 --> 14:15.026
because of irresponsible,
reckless motorcyclists?

14:15.026 --> 14:17.442
- I wasn't driving.
- And you were high!

14:17.442 --> 14:18.443
You were high
on top of it.

14:18.443 --> 14:20.031
We thought
it had worn off.

14:20.031 --> 14:21.895
Edibles stay in your system
for hours.

14:21.895 --> 14:24.933
Anyway, they are legal,
so save the lecture.

14:24.933 --> 14:28.039
It's not legal to drive
while intoxicated.

14:28.039 --> 14:29.420
Are you guys done?

14:29.420 --> 14:31.422
I have to take the bike
back to my dad's garage

14:31.422 --> 14:32.768
before he notices
it's gone.

14:32.768 --> 14:34.425
- Okay.
- And you stole a bike!

14:34.425 --> 14:36.047
Stop yelling at me!

14:36.047 --> 14:38.636
It's only stealing
if I don't return it.

14:38.636 --> 14:39.568
Yeah, you don't think
he'll notice

14:39.568 --> 14:40.534
that you're
busted up first?

14:40.534 --> 14:41.811
Nope.

14:43.434 --> 14:44.607
Okay,
what is going on?

14:44.607 --> 14:46.057
I'm fine.

14:46.057 --> 14:48.059
Think I just pulled
a muscle in the fall.

14:48.059 --> 14:49.716
You don't have to pretend
you're not hurt

14:49.716 --> 14:50.717
so people
think you're tough.

14:50.717 --> 14:52.305
Just let us take you
to the hospital.

14:52.305 --> 14:55.135
Lady, I don't want to go to jail
for lane-splitting while high.

14:55.135 --> 14:56.136
It's not that deep.

14:56.136 --> 14:57.827
Okay,
can we go now?

14:57.827 --> 14:59.933
I need to go find
some new jeans.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.452
No, you need to find
some new friends,

15:01.452 --> 15:03.109
'cause is this really the crowd
you want to run with?

15:03.109 --> 15:04.558
Oh, my God.
Are you for real?

15:04.558 --> 15:06.112
Yeah, I'm a better friend
to her than you.

15:06.112 --> 15:07.630
Oh, okay.

15:07.630 --> 15:09.253
You know, you are not to do
drugs with my sister again,

15:09.253 --> 15:11.324
nor put her on the back
of a stolen motorcycle.

15:11.324 --> 15:12.428
Stay away from her.

15:12.428 --> 15:13.257
I'm serious.
What?

15:13.257 --> 15:14.499
Am I 12?

15:14.499 --> 15:16.260
I'm--Brooke, let's go.

15:16.260 --> 15:18.641
Hey, you asked for my help,
and I'm giving it, alright?

15:18.641 --> 15:20.574
You're acting like
an irresponsible brat.

15:20.574 --> 15:22.438
Okay, I do not know
what I was thinking.

15:22.438 --> 15:23.784
I can barely stand
the family I already have,

15:23.784 --> 15:25.994
and yet I managed
to track down more of them,

15:25.994 --> 15:28.582
as if I don't already have
someone trying to micromanage

15:28.582 --> 15:30.757
every moment
of my existence.

15:30.757 --> 15:32.000
Clara, come on!

15:32.000 --> 15:34.347
I'm-- I'm
just feeling--

15:34.347 --> 15:36.349
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

15:36.349 --> 15:37.522
Clara?
Got her?

15:37.522 --> 15:38.592
Yeah.
She okay?

15:38.592 --> 15:40.146
Clara? Clara!

15:43.977 --> 15:46.773
She's bleeding internally.
We gotta go.

15:46.773 --> 15:47.981
Oh, my God.
Is she-- Is she gonna die?

15:47.981 --> 15:49.776
No, we're not gonna
let that happen, okay?

15:49.776 --> 15:50.984
You're gonna ride
in the back with us.

15:50.984 --> 15:53.090
We'll get you both
to the hospital, alright?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.510
You want to find the long lug, alright?

15:59.510 --> 16:00.960
Long lug means life.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.271
Just remember, probie,
they're for--

16:02.271 --> 16:03.859
On fire attack,
you use your hose line

16:03.859 --> 16:05.274
to find your way out, alright?

16:05.274 --> 16:06.275
Right. Yeah, no.

16:06.275 --> 16:08.208
I knew that. I just forgot.

16:08.208 --> 16:09.382
- Thank you.
- That's-- that's okay.

16:09.382 --> 16:11.039
That's what
we're here for.

16:11.039 --> 16:13.386
Not the guys at 88.

16:13.386 --> 16:15.664
Ah, you know, some
firehouses are old school.

16:15.664 --> 16:17.045
Trust, they're
looking out for you.

16:17.045 --> 16:18.805
You just gotta go through
a little hazing is all.

16:18.805 --> 16:20.393
- Yeah, right.
- You got it.

16:20.393 --> 16:21.463
Alright.

16:21.463 --> 16:23.016
She would have had
my butt, man.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.673
Oh, man, I still can't
believe we made it.

16:24.673 --> 16:27.193
Fresh off a call and right
to your baby girl's birth.

16:27.193 --> 16:28.297
Wait, what?

16:28.297 --> 16:29.989
You-- How'd you
pull that off?

16:29.989 --> 16:32.198
This guy went Code 3.

16:32.198 --> 16:34.648
Lights and sirens--
got me there just in time.

16:34.648 --> 16:35.649
And thank God, 'cause Sarah
would have killed me

16:35.649 --> 16:37.030
if I had missed it.

16:37.030 --> 16:39.308
And how is Sarah?
You ever pop the question?

16:39.308 --> 16:40.654
Not yet.

16:40.654 --> 16:41.862
Well, you know,
you already got the kid.

16:41.862 --> 16:44.555
It's been four years.
Just do it.

16:44.555 --> 16:47.730
I will. I will.

16:47.730 --> 16:49.077
I mean,
I got the ring.

16:49.077 --> 16:50.906
Well, what are
you waiting for?

16:50.906 --> 16:52.252
Yeah, it's just
gotta be perfect.

16:52.252 --> 16:53.874
Yep, I get it.

16:53.874 --> 16:55.048
Got one shot
at making it perfect.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.222
How romantic, Sully.

16:56.222 --> 16:57.671
Makes me a little sick
to my stomach.

16:57.671 --> 16:59.018
But simulation's up!

16:59.018 --> 17:01.192
Let's go!

17:05.679 --> 17:07.750
Alright,
her vitals are stable,

17:07.750 --> 17:09.200
so that'll buy us
some time, okay?

17:11.720 --> 17:12.962
Hey.

17:12.962 --> 17:14.585
Your friend's gonna be okay, alright?

17:14.585 --> 17:16.932
I was just making sure
her airway was protected

17:16.932 --> 17:18.106
so that she could breathe,
that's all.

17:18.106 --> 17:20.349
You don't--
You don't need to freak out.

17:20.349 --> 17:22.455
I'm not.

17:22.455 --> 17:25.941
Not on the outside.

17:25.941 --> 17:28.944
I freak out up here.

17:28.944 --> 17:33.949
I mean, I-I don't show it,
but, uh, it's like a hurricane

17:33.949 --> 17:36.917
when bad things start
happening, you know?

17:36.917 --> 17:38.747
Yeah, same.

17:38.747 --> 17:39.748
Yeah.

17:45.305 --> 17:46.651
Feeling better?

17:46.651 --> 17:48.619
No.

17:48.619 --> 17:51.380
I couldn't enjoy it.

17:51.380 --> 17:57.455
I was thinking if I give up
my hours at Station 19...

17:59.595 --> 18:02.391
Right now, they're the only
connection I have with Maya.

18:02.391 --> 18:07.431
Well, she really seems to be
trying to connect with you now.

18:07.431 --> 18:10.606
Does lasagna mean
something to you two?

18:10.606 --> 18:12.988
More than you can imagine.

18:12.988 --> 18:15.818
Uh, she told me to leave,
Dr. Bailey.

18:15.818 --> 18:18.166
She was-- She was the one
who said we were over.

18:18.166 --> 18:20.340
Okay, I don't believe
for one second

18:20.340 --> 18:23.930
that you and Maya
are over.

18:23.930 --> 18:28.866
Hey, Ben and I,
we have been through it all.

18:28.866 --> 18:31.593
There was a time when we were
even separated,

18:31.593 --> 18:34.147
not unlike you
and your wife now.

18:34.147 --> 18:36.632
Two weaker hearts
would not have survived it,

18:36.632 --> 18:40.464
but Ben and I did.

18:40.464 --> 18:44.157
And we came out the other side
stronger than ever.

18:44.157 --> 18:47.678
You and Maya will
get through this

18:47.678 --> 18:49.197
if you want to
get through it.

18:49.197 --> 18:51.164
Ah.
You okay?

18:51.164 --> 18:52.855
Yeah.

18:52.855 --> 18:55.375
Suddenly,
my stomach feels--

18:55.375 --> 18:57.101
The lasagna tasted
kind of funny. Oh!

19:04.729 --> 19:07.353
Oh, no.
That is not right.

19:09.113 --> 19:11.011
You know, you could have stayed
at the hospital with Brooke.

19:11.011 --> 19:12.634
I would have
covered for you.

19:12.634 --> 19:15.223
Yeah, no.
She doesn't need me.

19:15.223 --> 19:16.327
Oh, right.

19:16.327 --> 19:18.053
She just showed up
at the station high,

19:18.053 --> 19:19.537
with slight head trauma
because she wanted

19:19.537 --> 19:21.332
to take pictures
with the fire pole.

19:24.128 --> 19:27.200
You know, when I was
in foster care,

19:27.200 --> 19:29.202
I was the one who would
take care of everyone.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.100
Yeah, no. I stole food
for the younger ones

19:31.100 --> 19:32.861
when the big kids
would hoard it.

19:32.861 --> 19:36.416
I-I would--
Uh, I would find old socks

19:36.416 --> 19:38.487
to wrap cuts in when
they wouldn't stop bleeding.

19:38.487 --> 19:39.937
And I thought I knew
what it meant to be

19:39.937 --> 19:42.491
an older brother, but...

19:42.491 --> 19:44.113
now I'm not so sure.

19:44.113 --> 19:45.736
I mean, I-- W-What am
I supposed to be for her?

19:45.736 --> 19:47.703
A-A guardian?

19:47.703 --> 19:49.912
Friend? Brother?

19:49.912 --> 19:51.604
Just be there for her.

19:51.604 --> 19:53.847
Yeah, I thought
I was, but...

19:53.847 --> 19:55.918
You know,
I suck at this.

19:55.918 --> 19:57.334
You'll figure it out.

19:57.334 --> 19:59.232
Just don't push anything
you're both uncomfortable with.

19:59.232 --> 20:00.785
Like,
find a balance.

20:00.785 --> 20:02.235
Listen to me.

20:02.235 --> 20:03.547
"Find a balance."

20:03.547 --> 20:05.134
I'm probably
the last person

20:05.134 --> 20:07.896
that should be dishing out
life advice right now.

20:07.896 --> 20:09.449
Yeah, well, we've put the team
through hell, you and me, huh?

20:09.449 --> 20:11.934
We're messy. Mm.

20:11.934 --> 20:14.074
Yeah, but who's messier,
you or me?

20:14.074 --> 20:15.800
I mean,
it's obvious, isn't it?

20:15.800 --> 20:17.077
Oh, yeah.

20:17.077 --> 20:18.907
Me.
It's me.

20:23.291 --> 20:25.879
Miranda?

20:25.879 --> 20:27.156
What?

20:27.156 --> 20:29.262
Where is she?

20:29.262 --> 20:30.401
Turn right.

20:30.401 --> 20:31.402
Nine minutes.
Nine minutes?

20:31.402 --> 20:32.921
Hey, 19!

20:32.921 --> 20:34.647
How's about upping the tab
to three rounds of drinks?

20:34.647 --> 20:35.613
Nah, nah.
Why stop there?

20:35.613 --> 20:37.443
Why not four?

20:37.443 --> 20:39.445
We'll call ahead to the bar
and let them know to expect us

20:39.445 --> 20:41.585
while you guys finish
your little simulation, okay?

20:41.585 --> 20:43.138
Alright.

20:43.138 --> 20:45.278
This third phase is about
cohesion, efficiency,

20:45.278 --> 20:46.314
and multi-tasking.

20:46.314 --> 20:47.625
But I want to keep it interesting,

20:47.625 --> 20:49.420
so I'm gonna mix things up.

20:49.420 --> 20:51.111
Each team's fire attack unit

20:51.111 --> 20:53.459
will be inside the simulation
at the same time,

20:53.459 --> 20:55.495
knocking down the fire
and searching for the dummy--

20:55.495 --> 20:57.394
just one dummy.

20:57.394 --> 21:00.466
You've all won me over with
your competitive spirit today,

21:00.466 --> 21:05.781
so whichever team recovers
the dummy first wins this round.

21:05.781 --> 21:07.473
Understood?

21:07.473 --> 21:08.577
Cooper, probie.

21:08.577 --> 21:09.958
Damn.
Probie.

21:09.958 --> 21:11.580
Sir.
Great.

21:11.580 --> 21:13.927
Warren, Herrera, you're up.

21:13.927 --> 21:14.756
We got this.

21:14.756 --> 21:15.688
- We got this.
- Easy money.

21:15.688 --> 21:17.137
- Let's go.
- Come on, Herrera.

21:17.137 --> 21:18.518
Show them how it's done.
Show them how it's done.

21:18.518 --> 21:19.795
Oh, man, I got a toddler that
gets dressed faster than this.

21:19.795 --> 21:20.969
- Let's go!
- We're ready over here.

21:20.969 --> 21:22.211
Bring it back.
Bring it back to the house.

21:22.211 --> 21:23.454
- How you doing, probie?
- Good, sir!

21:23.454 --> 21:24.766
May the best team win!

21:24.766 --> 21:26.354
Thanks!
We plan on it!

21:26.354 --> 21:28.321
Alright, come on.

21:28.321 --> 21:30.150
Go, go, go, go!
Go!

21:30.150 --> 21:32.636
Come on, 19!

21:35.155 --> 21:37.330
Follow me.
Stay close this time.

21:37.330 --> 21:38.711
Let's try the west side.
Clear ahead!

21:41.196 --> 21:42.335
Let's go, probie!

21:42.335 --> 21:44.199
Our reputations and wallets
are at stake.

21:44.199 --> 21:45.338
Yes, sir.

21:49.618 --> 21:52.863

the first three rooms.

21:55.348 --> 21:57.695

21:57.695 --> 21:59.904
Just follow
the hose line.

22:12.365 --> 22:14.678

25:18.689 --> 25:20.588
Ball of fire big enough
to knock out two firefighters

25:20.588 --> 25:22.866
during a simulation?

25:22.866 --> 25:24.005
It's either
a freak accident,

25:34.912 --> 25:40.124
Okay, uh, send 19 back
to the station.

25:40.124 --> 25:42.886
You're to take on 88's

25:42.886 --> 25:45.923

Well, college isn't the end all,

26:00.593 --> 26:03.562
and I don't think a degree
is necessarily

26:03.562 --> 26:06.806
a mark for honor
or good character.

26:06.806 --> 26:08.394
It was actually
my colleague Dean Miller

26:08.394 --> 26:09.982
who founded the program.

26:09.982 --> 26:11.328
Well, to be honest,
on the list of things

26:11.328 --> 26:12.916
that need fixing
in Greenwood,

26:12.916 --> 26:14.296
potholes are the least
of their worries.

26:14.296 --> 26:16.609
Once we started putting water
on the fire, we hear this

26:16.609 --> 26:18.784
"pop-pop-pop" sound,
and these little missiles

26:18.784 --> 26:20.717
start flying through the air.

26:20.717 --> 26:24.410
We find out later, okay,
what was inside of them?

26:24.410 --> 26:27.102
Bull semen.

26:27.102 --> 26:28.103
I was covered in it.

26:28.103 --> 26:29.760
Hello?

26:29.760 --> 26:31.003
How many more?

26:31.003 --> 26:32.591
Don't worry about numbers.
You got this.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.178
Don't look at
what I'm missing.

26:34.178 --> 26:36.629
Look at what I'm offering--
insight into what Seattle needs,

26:36.629 --> 26:40.426
honed by years of public service
on the streets,

26:40.426 --> 26:44.948
not observed from the window
of an office at City Hall.

26:44.948 --> 26:46.501
Caller #2: <i>Thank you so much,
Mr. Montgomery.</i>

26:46.501 --> 26:47.916
Thank you very much.

26:47.916 --> 26:49.297
Okay, it was a pleasure.

26:49.297 --> 26:53.508
<i>And we're off.</i> Okay. Bye-bye.

26:53.508 --> 26:54.923
That was brilliant.

26:54.923 --> 26:55.924
Please, no more.

26:55.924 --> 26:59.376
You only have
seven more.

26:59.376 --> 27:00.826
I'm gonna need
some more coffee.

27:12.665 --> 27:14.356
I heard you were sick.

27:14.356 --> 27:16.842
I, um, I brought some fluids
to help make you feel better.

27:22.330 --> 27:23.952
Maya, go away!

27:23.952 --> 27:25.644
I told you
I don't want to see you.

27:25.644 --> 27:28.129
I can't leave you
like this.

27:28.129 --> 27:29.993
Yes, you can.

27:29.993 --> 27:33.237
If you would just
open the door--

27:33.237 --> 27:35.032
I'm not letting you in.

27:35.032 --> 27:37.863
I'm sick and I'm tired.

27:39.934 --> 27:42.661
Seeing you show up
at my work today was torture.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.386
I-I asked you
for space.

27:44.386 --> 27:46.009
I need space. Yeah.

27:46.009 --> 27:49.495
I understand that,
but we're married,

27:49.495 --> 27:51.186
and I intend to
stay married.

27:51.186 --> 27:52.532
But if we don't
eventually talk,

27:52.532 --> 27:54.258
I don't see how
we're gonna survive this.

27:54.258 --> 27:56.502
You just want to talk to me like
I'm another check on your list

27:56.502 --> 27:58.642
of things to fix
in your life.

28:05.580 --> 28:07.202
That's it.

28:07.202 --> 28:09.101
You made up with your friends,
you got your job back,

28:09.101 --> 28:11.103
and now the only thing
left to do

28:11.103 --> 28:13.899
is for me to forget about
everything and come back home.

28:13.899 --> 28:14.900
It's not gonna happen
that way.

28:14.900 --> 28:17.523
I'm done.
I'm-- I'm done.

28:17.523 --> 28:19.767
I'm done being pulled around
like a doll.

28:19.767 --> 28:21.700
I'm done being
set to the side by you.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.184
I'm done.

28:23.184 --> 28:25.151
I'm done, and now you
literally poisoned me.

28:38.337 --> 28:40.097
Carina?

28:40.097 --> 28:41.478
Carina!

28:41.478 --> 28:43.963
I'm so cold.

28:46.897 --> 28:49.072
Can you please bring me
some blankets?

29:29.008 --> 29:30.665
Okay, can somebody
please just say something

29:30.665 --> 29:32.115
- before I scream?
- What? What--

29:32.115 --> 29:33.944
Is-- Does Chief Ross
even know what happened?

29:33.944 --> 29:35.290
I'm pretty sure
she knows by now.

29:35.290 --> 29:37.154
There's gonna be
an investigation on this, okay?

29:37.154 --> 29:38.811
You can count on that.

29:38.811 --> 29:40.606
Okay, so until then, we're
just supposed to wait to hear

29:40.606 --> 29:42.194
whether this guy is dead or not,
and then after that,

29:42.194 --> 29:44.472
we gotta wait to see
what caused this accident?

29:44.472 --> 29:45.991
It's too much waiting.
It's just too much.

29:45.991 --> 29:47.164
I don't even think
I want to know.

29:47.164 --> 29:48.821
It's better than never knowing
at all, right?

29:48.821 --> 29:51.617
What we need to do is ground
ourselves in what we know now--

29:51.617 --> 29:54.378
that-- that Beckett and Warren
will let us know about Cooper,

29:54.378 --> 29:57.105
and Ross will get to the bottom
of what really happened today.

29:57.105 --> 29:58.831
No, what happened
is Beckett messed up.

29:58.831 --> 30:00.729
Look, we need
evidence, okay?

30:00.729 --> 30:02.386
Not just speculation.

30:02.386 --> 30:03.732
It was a huge ball
of fire, man!

30:03.732 --> 30:04.975
Hey, Ruiz, enough.

30:04.975 --> 30:07.046
What we're not gonna do
is speculate

30:07.046 --> 30:09.531
or throw anybody under the bus
until we have all the facts.

30:09.531 --> 30:10.601
Clear?

30:13.432 --> 30:15.848
Clear.

30:15.848 --> 30:18.368
Well, it was my pleasure,
and like I said before,

30:18.368 --> 30:19.714
I'm a big fan
of the show.

30:19.714 --> 30:21.129
Host #2: <i>Thanks so much.</i>

30:21.129 --> 30:22.855
Okay. Anytime.

30:22.855 --> 30:25.375
<i>Uh, before you go, we're
getting word from a source</i>

30:25.375 --> 30:26.859
<i>close to
the Dixon campaign</i>

30:26.859 --> 30:28.550
<i>that their internal
polling shows</i>

30:28.550 --> 30:30.518
<i>you're now
in a virtual dead heat.</i>

30:30.518 --> 30:33.072
<i>You're even pulling ahead
of Osman for the first time.</i>

30:33.072 --> 30:35.695
<i>What's your reaction to gaining
so much traction lately?</i>

30:38.388 --> 30:39.596
I--
<i>Hello?</i>

30:39.596 --> 30:40.769
<i>Did we lose you?
Are-- Are you--</i>

30:40.769 --> 30:42.392
I-I'm thrilled,
of course,

30:42.392 --> 30:46.845
and humbled that so many
people are supporting me.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.916
But, of course, the only
poll that matters

30:48.916 --> 30:50.503
is the one on
election day,

30:50.503 --> 30:54.197
so I'm going to continue
to work to earn your vote.

30:54.197 --> 30:55.543
<i>That's great to hear.</i>

30:55.543 --> 30:56.993
<i>It's been so good
speaking with you,</i>

30:56.993 --> 30:58.615
<i>and good luck
the rest of the way.</i>

30:58.615 --> 31:01.618
Okay.
Thank you so much.

31:01.618 --> 31:04.724
Oh, my God.

31:04.724 --> 31:05.864
Holy--
What--

31:05.864 --> 31:07.244
What does this mean, exactly?

31:07.244 --> 31:11.904
Okay, polls are trash,
but this is huge.

31:11.904 --> 31:13.699
If things keep
trending this way,

31:13.699 --> 31:14.907
you could actually end up

31:14.907 --> 31:17.806
being the next mayor
of Seattle.

31:26.436 --> 31:27.437
Wow.

31:33.098 --> 31:34.616
Aren't you supposed
to be at work?

31:34.616 --> 31:36.756
I am at work.

31:36.756 --> 31:38.206
Nonstop vomiting
can be serious.

31:38.206 --> 31:41.037
I am a paramedic
preventing a catastrophe.

31:41.037 --> 31:46.214
Mm, a catastrophe that you
literally baked into a lasagna.

31:46.214 --> 31:48.044
H-How do you
mess up a lasagna?

31:48.044 --> 31:49.562
I don't know.

31:49.562 --> 31:51.910
I thought I did
everything right.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.325
Okay, I was in a rush,

31:53.325 --> 31:56.121
and I wanted to get it to you
while it was still hot.

31:56.121 --> 32:01.816
I-I did take it out of the oven
a few minutes early.

32:01.816 --> 32:03.852
How early?

32:05.130 --> 32:07.028
Did it
at least taste okay?

32:12.137 --> 32:14.346
Thank you for coming.

32:14.346 --> 32:17.142
Thank you
for letting me in.

32:25.633 --> 32:27.497
You have to go?

32:27.497 --> 32:28.498
I'll stay.

32:28.498 --> 32:29.948
Maya...
No.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.501
You could be dehydrated.

32:31.501 --> 32:33.330
You could be sicker
than we think.

32:33.330 --> 32:36.092
I don't...

32:36.092 --> 32:37.714
What?

32:40.130 --> 32:42.029
I am afraid that if
I walk out that door,

32:42.029 --> 32:44.203
I don't know when
I'll see you again.

32:44.203 --> 32:45.964
Hey, you will.

32:48.173 --> 32:50.175
You will.

32:50.175 --> 32:52.384
I'm gonna check in
in a few hours and let you know

32:52.384 --> 32:54.179
how I'm doing.

32:56.146 --> 32:57.630
Hey, no crying.

33:10.989 --> 33:14.578
Warren, ever--
Hey, hey.

33:14.578 --> 33:17.064
So, um...

33:17.064 --> 33:20.688
They did everything
they could, but, uh...

33:20.688 --> 33:22.034
but Cooper didn't make it.

33:25.865 --> 33:28.868
Okay, uh,
how's James?

33:28.868 --> 33:31.526
He's fine, you know, at--
at least physically.

33:31.526 --> 33:33.080
What about the rest
of 88?

33:33.080 --> 33:35.910
They lost their brother.

33:35.910 --> 33:37.222
Cooper was
a really good man.

33:37.222 --> 33:39.258
You know, this is
all your fault!

33:39.258 --> 33:40.259
Excuse me?

33:40.259 --> 33:41.571
You're drinking again,
aren't you?

33:41.571 --> 33:43.021
Theo, stand down.
No!

33:43.021 --> 33:44.677
No, a huge burst of flames
like that

33:44.677 --> 33:46.231
in a controlled simulation
only happens

33:46.231 --> 33:49.268
because of a misplaced
or forgotten accelerant inside.

33:49.268 --> 33:51.615
Now, I know, because I set up
dozens of these trainings.

33:51.615 --> 33:53.548
Cooper was helping
with those setups.

33:53.548 --> 33:55.412
Yeah, okay, sure.

33:55.412 --> 33:56.724
Well,
how about you tell us

33:56.724 --> 33:59.175
what was really inside
that water bottle, hmm?

33:59.175 --> 34:00.624
Why didn't you need any of
your stupid little

34:00.624 --> 34:02.074
breath mints all day, huh?

34:02.074 --> 34:03.282
Prove me wrong.

34:03.282 --> 34:05.733
Take a Breathalyzer test
right here, right now.

34:05.733 --> 34:08.736
Or better yet, show us all
your water bottle.

34:08.736 --> 34:10.945
I bet the whiff of booze
will still be fresh.

34:10.945 --> 34:12.533
You need to watch
your back, Ruiz.

34:12.533 --> 34:13.637
I am your captain.

34:13.637 --> 34:14.914
Cooper was my probie.

34:14.914 --> 34:16.916
Have some respect!

34:16.916 --> 34:18.228
Hey, if you got nothing
to hide...

34:18.228 --> 34:19.126
Now, I don't want to hear
another word about this...

34:19.126 --> 34:20.541
...then you got nothing
to worry about!

34:20.541 --> 34:21.887
...until a full investigation's
been done, and if I do,

34:21.887 --> 34:25.097
I will have you suspended
without pay!

34:27.996 --> 34:29.205
What?!

34:29.205 --> 34:31.138
Alright.

34:34.865 --> 34:36.143
Alright?

34:47.982 --> 34:50.985
What a day.

34:50.985 --> 34:52.780
Are you good?

34:52.780 --> 34:54.333
Do you--
Do you need a meeting?

34:54.333 --> 34:56.611
Yeah, I do.

34:56.611 --> 34:57.957
But I'll go when I can.

35:02.307 --> 35:04.136
Can I tell you something,

35:04.136 --> 35:06.242
between you, me,
and nobody else?

35:06.242 --> 35:09.521
I'm scared we're all about
to fall off the edge of a cliff.

35:09.521 --> 35:11.833
You know, I gave Beckett
the benefit of the doubt

35:11.833 --> 35:15.009
to try and salvage
team unity, but...

35:15.009 --> 35:17.770
Man, I-I'm not sure
about him anymore.

35:17.770 --> 35:19.876
Well, between me, you,
and nobody else,

35:19.876 --> 35:21.464
I wonder if Beckett's
off the wagon, too.

35:21.464 --> 35:24.018
He's defensive.
He's hostile.

35:24.018 --> 35:26.020
If he had agreed
to a Breathalyzer test

35:26.020 --> 35:27.780
or shown us his water bottle,
he could've...

35:27.780 --> 35:28.781
Yes.

35:28.781 --> 35:30.162
...put this
whole thing rest.

35:30.162 --> 35:32.992
But he didn't.
No.

35:32.992 --> 35:34.546
Cooper has
a little girl.

35:37.583 --> 35:40.448
He was supposed to
propose to his girlfriend.

35:40.448 --> 35:42.519
Kept putting it off.

35:42.519 --> 35:45.350
Yeah.

35:45.350 --> 35:49.008
There's no guarantees
in this life.

35:49.008 --> 35:50.217
Especially for us.

35:52.840 --> 35:54.393
Yeah.

35:57.224 --> 35:58.880
Oh.

35:58.880 --> 36:00.468
I, uh,
I heard what happened.

36:00.468 --> 36:02.194
I wanted to be here
with the team.

36:02.194 --> 36:04.403
Who are you?

36:04.403 --> 36:07.234
It's not really feeling
like much of a team right now.

36:07.234 --> 36:08.649
Look, Trav,
you didn't have to...

36:08.649 --> 36:10.892
No, I-I wanted to.
I'm a firefighter, right?

36:10.892 --> 36:12.411
I do
firefighter stuff,

36:12.411 --> 36:15.518
like saving lives
and cleaning ladder trucks.

36:15.518 --> 36:16.864
Put my uniform
on every day

36:16.864 --> 36:19.315
and I know who I am
and what I can do.

36:19.315 --> 36:21.317
In the next few weeks,
come election day,

36:21.317 --> 36:26.114
I may be trading my uniform
in for another one.

36:26.114 --> 36:27.875
It's a real possibility,
and it's life-changing,

36:27.875 --> 36:30.015
and I just-- I guess
I just needed to come here

36:30.015 --> 36:32.190
and be a firefighter
with my team.

36:39.887 --> 36:43.339
Alright, give me this.

36:43.339 --> 36:45.444
Remember how to do this,
big shot?

36:45.444 --> 36:46.756
Hmm?

36:58.733 --> 37:01.564
Yeah, gift shop chic
isn't usually my style,

37:01.564 --> 37:04.808
but I had to make do.

37:04.808 --> 37:06.258
It's not as bad
as it looks.

37:06.258 --> 37:08.156
If you say so.

37:08.156 --> 37:09.434
Yeah, Clara's gonna be
alright, by the way.

37:09.434 --> 37:10.918
Thanks for asking.

37:10.918 --> 37:12.264
Why are you here?

37:12.264 --> 37:14.922
Why did you contact me?

37:14.922 --> 37:17.373
I thought you and I
could be friends.

37:17.373 --> 37:19.754
You grew up wishing you
could be a part of my family.

37:19.754 --> 37:22.723
I grew up wishing I could
get away from them.

37:22.723 --> 37:24.897
Thought we could
understand each other.

37:24.897 --> 37:26.416
You have no idea
what I've been through,

37:26.416 --> 37:29.143
because if you did, you'd
take back what you just said.

37:29.143 --> 37:30.731
Okay, then
tell me about it,

37:30.731 --> 37:34.321
because I do not feel like
I belong with them,

37:34.321 --> 37:40.672
and if you're the missing piece,
then I'd like to find out.

37:40.672 --> 37:44.158
So just
give us a chance,

37:44.158 --> 37:46.781
without the lecture-y
older brother bit?

37:46.781 --> 37:49.163
Really kills my vibe.

37:53.201 --> 37:54.479
You know, I used to have
a girlfriend that used to say

37:54.479 --> 37:57.482
"harshes my mellow."

37:57.482 --> 37:58.828
Old people are funny.

38:03.004 --> 38:06.456
So, what, you want
to start over?

38:06.456 --> 38:09.217
Sounds good to me.

38:09.217 --> 38:10.840
I'm Brooke.

38:13.394 --> 38:14.637
That's my sister's name.

38:14.637 --> 38:16.328
She's kind of a lot,

Ah, there you are. Wow.

39:12.867 --> 39:14.352
You are
so obsessed with me.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.698
What?

39:15.698 --> 39:17.078
Montgomery isn't
even on shift yet,

39:17.078 --> 39:19.287
and yet you still manage
to end up at the station,

39:19.287 --> 39:20.910
and that's what I call
"sprung."

39:20.910 --> 39:23.015
Actually, I'm just here to drop
off your apartment keys, so...

39:23.015 --> 39:24.776
Ah.

39:24.776 --> 39:27.572
Uh, hope you didn't roam around
where you weren't supposed to.

39:27.572 --> 39:30.195
Nope. I'm holding out for
the personalized tour later.

39:30.195 --> 39:32.508
Of course you are.

39:32.508 --> 39:36.132
I've, uh, I've asked around,
and I heard you like dancing.

39:36.132 --> 39:38.583
Like I said, obsessed.

39:38.583 --> 39:40.688
Well, it's given me
inspiration for our date.

39:40.688 --> 39:42.725
Yeah, I'm gonna have to
mentally prepare for that.

39:42.725 --> 39:45.141
Oh, don't worry.
I'm a decent lead.

39:45.141 --> 39:46.901
It's not me
I'm worried about.

39:49.248 --> 39:51.458
I heard about
your day today.

39:51.458 --> 39:53.114
Yeah.

39:53.114 --> 39:54.633
I spent it
listening to Travis

39:54.633 --> 39:57.878
talking to concerned citizens
all over the city.

39:57.878 --> 39:59.397
Never ceases to amaze me

39:59.397 --> 40:02.779
how tired everyone is of all
the polarization in politics.

40:02.779 --> 40:07.715
How division can disrupt us all
and leave people feeling

40:07.715 --> 40:11.132
alone
and just exhausted.

40:11.132 --> 40:13.169
My team's morale is
hanging by a thread,

40:13.169 --> 40:16.897
and I-I have no idea
what to do.

40:16.897 --> 40:18.312
I've tried
keeping the peace, but--

40:18.312 --> 40:19.727
Well, there's
your first problem.

40:19.727 --> 40:22.109
When has anyone been
successful in keeping the peace?

40:22.109 --> 40:23.904
Well, nothing else
has worked.

40:23.904 --> 40:27.079
I've tried everything
to salvage the house

40:27.079 --> 40:30.324
that I grew up in, the--
the team I know we can be.

40:30.324 --> 40:32.671
Well, if you want
unsolicited advice

40:32.671 --> 40:34.362
from
an outside observer...

40:34.362 --> 40:35.467
Would you shut up
if I said I don't?

40:35.467 --> 40:38.263
What do you think?
Yeah.

40:38.263 --> 40:41.508
Look, neutrality can
only take you so far.

40:41.508 --> 40:44.959
Eventually, people start to see
right through that facade.

40:44.959 --> 40:47.755
I mean, the politicians
underestimate voters

40:47.755 --> 40:49.516
by thinking they're
these mindless sheep

40:49.516 --> 40:51.483
that can be swayed
by a colorful, catchy sign

40:51.483 --> 40:56.384
and vague promises,
but, you know, voters catch on.

40:56.384 --> 40:58.697
A strong stance is worth
more in a leader

40:58.697 --> 41:00.181
than
a mild peacekeeper.

41:00.181 --> 41:04.600
You are not
a mild peacekeeper.

41:04.600 --> 41:07.672
You're strong, Andy.

41:07.672 --> 41:10.122
Stronger than any person
I've ever met.

41:13.401 --> 41:16.474
So, uh, I know it won't
mean much to you

41:16.474 --> 41:18.821
when I say that
I'm here for you,

41:18.821 --> 41:22.963
but if I can help lighten
the load even a little,

41:22.963 --> 41:25.310
I'd be happy to.

41:25.310 --> 41:27.001
