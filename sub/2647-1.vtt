WEBVTT

01:35.308 --> 01:36.297
Morning, professor.

01:36.375 --> 01:37.740
Good morning.

02:28.261 --> 02:30.525
What do we have
on the board today?

02:31.130 --> 02:32.961
Dr. Cross will be wanting
to pick up

02:33.032 --> 02:36.934
those three 629 Pullmans.

02:37.570 --> 02:40.664
And 630 Observation.

02:40.740 --> 02:42.503
Shouldn't be a problem.

03:02.995 --> 03:05.156
What number?

03:05.798 --> 03:08.130
Um, 423.

03:11.404 --> 03:13.838
I'll have your train
in two weeks.

03:13.906 --> 03:15.771
Uh, okay.

03:18.077 --> 03:19.567
Hi.

03:20.212 --> 03:21.736
Hey.

03:23.716 --> 03:25.513
You forget something?

03:25.618 --> 03:26.983
No.

03:29.955 --> 03:31.149
Hike!

03:31.223 --> 03:32.656
Hike!

03:33.959 --> 03:35.017
All right.
Nice throw.

03:35.094 --> 03:36.254
Nice throw.

03:40.333 --> 03:43.166
Hey, buddy, where's Snow White?

03:43.502 --> 03:45.697
Grumpy or Sleepy
over there, huh?

03:53.479 --> 03:55.470
sLorraine, look.

03:55.548 --> 03:58.312
He's gonna hear you.
Stop.

04:06.692 --> 04:08.057
Miss.

04:09.028 --> 04:10.928
Paper or plastic?

04:11.931 --> 04:14.559
- Paper.
- Sorry.

04:15.101 --> 04:16.829
I didn't see you.

04:17.303 --> 04:19.668
- Cash or charge?
- Cash.

04:25.144 --> 04:28.011
Who's showing the movie tonight?

04:30.316 --> 04:31.783
Carl.

04:36.522 --> 04:39.980
The billowing smoke
as it's coming forward.

04:40.092 --> 04:43.255
My wife was inside the car,
staying warm,

04:43.329 --> 04:46.264
but I was on the hood.

04:46.332 --> 04:51.031
There's people standing by here
as it's going by.

04:51.103 --> 04:53.594
The traffic, of course,

04:53.672 --> 04:58.132
was stopped
to allow the train...

04:58.644 --> 04:59.406
Oh.

04:59.478 --> 05:01.946
Now, here I was hanging out
shooting this

05:02.047 --> 05:04.413
in Canada.

05:04.517 --> 05:07.042
This is Canada.
It's cold.

05:07.153 --> 05:08.916
Snow.

05:08.988 --> 05:16.053
The scenery was,
uh, really spectacular.

05:16.128 --> 05:18.392
See, because the train
is moving forward,

05:18.464 --> 05:19.931
the smoke is coming back.

05:19.999 --> 05:25.631
It was not extremely windy,
but the smoke did billow.

05:25.704 --> 05:28.867
And, oh, we're about to go
into a tunnel.

05:28.941 --> 05:31.034
Yeah, we're in a tunnel.

05:31.110 --> 05:33.340
For about a minute.

05:33.412 --> 05:37.246
It got colder
when we were in the tunnel.

05:37.349 --> 05:42.377
It was one of the darker tunnels
in Canada.

06:02.308 --> 06:03.935
Lunch.

06:30.069 --> 06:33.630
He was a nice man.
He was a nice man.

06:33.706 --> 06:35.606
I don't think we've ever met.

06:35.674 --> 06:37.107
No, but I've seen you around.

06:37.176 --> 06:41.476
Well, like, you're one of
those memorable people.

06:42.781 --> 06:45.773
I brought you down here
to discuss your inheritance.

06:45.851 --> 06:47.819
In his will,
Henry bequeathed to you

06:47.887 --> 06:51.414
some property
in Newfoundland, New Jersey.

06:51.524 --> 06:53.424
It's about half an acre of land.

06:53.492 --> 06:54.982
It's got an old train depot
on it.

06:55.060 --> 06:58.757
I have an appraisal of
the property for your records.

07:00.766 --> 07:03.428
- What's happening with the shop?
- The building's been sold.

07:03.502 --> 07:06.960
Golden Spike will be closed,
and the inventory liquidated.

07:07.039 --> 07:08.472
This is all, of course,

07:08.541 --> 07:11.169
in accordance with the terms
I drew up in Henry's will.

07:11.243 --> 07:12.938
How soon?

07:13.679 --> 07:16.671
If everything goes as planned,
no hitches, anything,

07:16.749 --> 07:19.513
a thing like this
takes about six weeks.

07:19.618 --> 07:22.086
I have some preliminary
paperwork for you to sign.

07:22.187 --> 07:23.654
Some other papers
being drawn up.

07:23.722 --> 07:25.656
We have the keys to the depot.

07:25.724 --> 07:27.385
You ever been out to New Jersey?

07:27.459 --> 07:28.517
No.

07:28.594 --> 07:31.290
I drove through it once.
Let me tell you.

07:31.363 --> 07:35.026
I mean, it's pretty,
but there's nothing out there.

07:35.100 --> 07:36.965
Nothing.

10:37.483 --> 10:39.246
Then where'd you go?

10:39.351 --> 10:41.216
I see.

10:41.854 --> 10:43.082
Good.

10:43.155 --> 10:44.884
So, what else, dude?

10:45.991 --> 10:47.151
Yeah?

10:47.226 --> 10:49.160
Andy, why don't you
come out here, bro?

10:49.228 --> 10:51.458
I'm going out of my mind.

10:52.598 --> 10:54.156
Holy shit.

10:54.500 --> 10:55.762
Hey, let me call you back.

10:55.834 --> 10:56.960
Bye.

10:58.904 --> 11:00.394
Wow.

11:00.472 --> 11:02.030
How you doing?

11:02.107 --> 11:03.039
Fine.

11:03.108 --> 11:04.735
Do you sell coffee?

11:05.277 --> 11:07.745
Cafe con leche.
It's the house special.

11:07.813 --> 11:09.576
- You'll love it. Trust me.
- Okay.

11:09.681 --> 11:11.672
I also got hot dogs and muffins.

11:11.784 --> 11:13.752
You live around here?

11:13.819 --> 11:16.617
- Yeah.
- I never seen you around.

11:16.688 --> 11:17.985
Where you from?

11:18.056 --> 11:19.921
- Hoboken.
- No shit?

11:19.992 --> 11:22.153
I live in Manhattan, dude.

11:22.227 --> 11:23.819
So, why you out here?
Work?

11:23.896 --> 11:26.126
Family?
Just, like...

11:26.198 --> 11:29.099
How much do I owe you
for the coffee?

11:29.168 --> 11:30.533
Oh, shit.
Sorry, man.

11:30.602 --> 11:32.126
It's a buck.

11:34.273 --> 11:36.070
Is there a convenience store
nearby?

11:36.141 --> 11:39.804
Yeah. Down the road about
a mile and a half on the right.

11:40.612 --> 11:42.341
This is my pop's truck,
by the way.

11:42.414 --> 11:44.041
He's sick.
That's why I'm out here.

11:44.149 --> 11:46.117
He can't get out of bed.

11:46.185 --> 11:48.312
I'm taking care
of this shit for him.

11:48.420 --> 11:50.149
I've been here for six weeks.

11:50.222 --> 11:52.315
It's driving me crazy.

11:52.391 --> 11:53.619
Thanks.

11:55.093 --> 11:57.493
Hey, I'm here every day
from 7:00 to 3:00.

11:57.563 --> 12:00.031
I'm Joe Oramas.
What's your name?

12:00.098 --> 12:01.087
Fin.

12:01.133 --> 12:02.896
Fin?

12:02.968 --> 12:04.265
Yeah.

12:04.336 --> 12:05.860
Cool.

12:06.438 --> 12:09.635
Hey, your place around here?

12:11.310 --> 12:12.572
Yeah.

12:30.429 --> 12:32.454
Oh, shit.

12:46.879 --> 12:48.210
Oh!

12:49.748 --> 12:51.238
Aah!

12:52.651 --> 12:54.346
Oh, my God.

12:54.453 --> 12:56.421
Oh, my God.

12:56.521 --> 12:58.682
Oh, my God.
Just stay there.

12:58.757 --> 13:00.019
Don't move.

13:00.092 --> 13:03.084
Don't try to get up.

13:03.829 --> 13:06.127
Oh, I'm so sorry.

13:06.198 --> 13:07.665
God.

13:07.733 --> 13:09.860
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

13:09.935 --> 13:11.266
- Can you move everything?
- Yeah.

13:11.336 --> 13:12.860
Are you sure?

13:12.938 --> 13:13.962
Yes.

13:14.039 --> 13:15.506
I'm fine.

13:16.842 --> 13:18.241
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

13:18.310 --> 13:20.608
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

13:24.116 --> 13:26.710
Can I give you a ride somewhere?

13:26.818 --> 13:28.285
No.

13:28.353 --> 13:29.945
You're sure?

13:30.255 --> 13:31.620
Yes.

13:32.190 --> 13:34.420
I'm sorry.

14:02.287 --> 14:03.720
Hey.

14:03.789 --> 14:05.256
Yoo-hoo.

14:17.302 --> 14:19.270
- Good afternoon, Olivia.
- Hi.

14:19.338 --> 14:22.068
One cafe con leche,
two sugar, coming up.

14:26.478 --> 14:28.673
- How you doing today?
- I'm fine.

14:28.747 --> 14:30.009
Here you go.

14:30.115 --> 14:32.447
Oh, hey, did you hear?

14:34.119 --> 14:36.212
Someone moved into the depot.

14:36.755 --> 14:38.017
Oh, that's great.

14:38.090 --> 14:39.580
Yeah.
He's an interesting guy.

14:39.691 --> 14:42.216
Actually, he's a little guy.

14:46.898 --> 14:48.798
Shit.

14:57.009 --> 14:57.941
That it?

14:58.010 --> 15:03.277
Uh, two packs of Drum
and some beef jerky.

15:03.382 --> 15:05.350
Help yourself to the jerky.

15:14.059 --> 15:16.789
Oh, shit.
There he is.

15:18.430 --> 15:19.920
Ow!

15:19.998 --> 15:22.466
Oh! Oh!

15:23.602 --> 15:25.433
God! Oh!

15:28.273 --> 15:30.241
Oh, my God.

15:30.308 --> 15:33.505
Oh. Oh. Oh.

15:35.847 --> 15:37.405
Oh, my God.

15:37.516 --> 15:39.279
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this.

15:39.384 --> 15:41.716
I can't.
I am so sorry.

15:41.787 --> 15:43.618
- Here.
- Stay.

15:44.356 --> 15:45.323
I saw you.

15:45.390 --> 15:47.950
I tried to put
my cafe con leche down,

15:48.026 --> 15:49.550
and it spilled all over my ass.

15:49.628 --> 15:52.358
It burned me very bad,
so I swerved.

15:52.431 --> 15:56.492
Can I at least give you a ride
back to your train station?

15:56.902 --> 15:59.871
The hot-dog guy
told me where you lived.

16:00.605 --> 16:02.300
No, I'm fine.

16:02.374 --> 16:03.306
You're sure?

16:03.375 --> 16:04.342
Yes.

16:04.409 --> 16:06.400
You're fine?

16:07.245 --> 16:09.042
You're...

16:11.883 --> 16:13.441
Ow.

16:22.227 --> 16:23.159
Yeah?

16:23.228 --> 16:24.695
Did she ask about me?

16:24.763 --> 16:26.390
What'd you tell her?

16:26.465 --> 16:28.296
Don't fucking tell her that.

16:28.366 --> 16:30.095
I don't know.
Make some shit up.

16:30.168 --> 16:31.999
I'll call you back.
Bye.

16:32.070 --> 16:34.595
Hey, Fin.
Bro, you live here?

16:34.673 --> 16:35.662
Yes.

16:35.740 --> 16:37.731
Wow, we're neighbors.
Nice.

16:37.809 --> 16:39.436
Hey, what happened to you?

16:39.511 --> 16:40.773
Nothing.

16:40.846 --> 16:42.746
Listen, do you want to
go down to the Mill

16:42.814 --> 16:43.803
and grab a beer later?

16:43.915 --> 16:44.882
No, thanks.

16:44.950 --> 16:46.747
- You don't drink?
- I do.

16:46.852 --> 16:48.251
You don't want to drink with me?

16:48.320 --> 16:50.185
- I don't like bars very much.
- Oh.

16:50.255 --> 16:53.224
Hey, how about I go get a six?
We can have it right here.

16:54.059 --> 16:55.253
No, thanks.

16:55.327 --> 16:57.261
What are you gonna do?

16:57.329 --> 16:59.297
I'm going for a walk.

16:59.364 --> 17:00.888
Oh, cool.

17:00.966 --> 17:02.627
You mind if I come along, man?

17:02.701 --> 17:03.998
I need the exercise.

17:04.069 --> 17:05.468
I'm turning into a fat shit.

17:05.537 --> 17:07.334
I usually go alone.

17:07.405 --> 17:09.599
I'm a good walker, bro.

17:09.674 --> 17:11.436
I prefer to go alone.

17:11.510 --> 17:13.478
Okay.
All right.

17:13.545 --> 17:15.308
Maybe next time, right?

17:15.981 --> 17:17.811
You know where to find me!

18:18.977 --> 18:20.535
Hi.

18:58.016 --> 19:00.382
You're safe.
No car.

19:00.852 --> 19:02.376
I never told you my name.

19:02.487 --> 19:04.785
Olivia Harris.

19:06.524 --> 19:08.048
This is for you.

19:08.126 --> 19:15.862
A housewarming-slash-sorry-
l-ran-you-off-the-road gift.

19:17.669 --> 19:20.263
Oh.
Thank you.

19:22.574 --> 19:24.769
It's dark.

19:30.548 --> 19:32.106
Do you have any glasses?

19:32.217 --> 19:35.653
Or we could just swig
from the bottle.

19:35.754 --> 19:37.085
I have mugs.

19:37.155 --> 19:38.520
Oh.

19:57.842 --> 20:00.310
When I was 19,
I actually slept with a guy

20:00.378 --> 20:02.869
because he rolled
his own cigarettes.

20:08.253 --> 20:10.050
Cheers.

20:20.131 --> 20:21.792
You never told me your name.

20:21.866 --> 20:22.890
Fin.

20:22.967 --> 20:25.060
Oh, that's a good name.

20:26.938 --> 20:29.065
You can get that if you want.

20:29.674 --> 20:32.006
My phone's disconnected.

20:32.077 --> 20:34.341
Oh, shit.
It's mine.

20:34.412 --> 20:36.642
I always forget
I have this thing.

20:36.748 --> 20:40.115
My husband gave it to me
in case of an emergency.

20:40.185 --> 20:42.278
Although he's not
my husband right now.

20:42.387 --> 20:43.945
We're separated.

20:44.456 --> 20:46.151
You don't have a phone?

20:46.224 --> 20:47.418
No.

20:47.492 --> 20:49.050
I love that.
I hate phones.

20:49.127 --> 20:52.392
I have two.
Never answer either of them.

20:55.967 --> 20:57.730
How'd you find this place?

20:57.802 --> 20:59.133
I inherited it.

20:59.204 --> 21:01.365
It's very nice.

21:02.941 --> 21:04.966
Oh!
I love this.

21:05.043 --> 21:06.476
What is this?

21:06.544 --> 21:08.102
It's an old ticket box.

21:08.179 --> 21:09.840
Oh, look at this little drawer.

21:09.914 --> 21:11.905
- Careful. That doesn't...
- Oh!

21:11.983 --> 21:13.177
Oh!

21:13.985 --> 21:15.782
Oh, God.

21:16.621 --> 21:18.384
I'm so sorry.

21:18.456 --> 21:20.720
Oh, my God.

21:20.792 --> 21:22.555
Oh.

21:23.828 --> 21:27.491
Can I sit here for a moment?

21:43.181 --> 21:45.149
Who left you this place?

21:45.250 --> 21:46.911
My friend Henry.

21:50.722 --> 21:52.713
When did he die?

21:52.824 --> 21:54.621
Three weeks ago.

21:55.860 --> 21:57.794
I'm sorry.

22:03.067 --> 22:05.535
My son, Sam, died.

22:06.538 --> 22:08.733
Two years ago.

22:14.679 --> 22:17.512
Would you mind not looking
at me right now?

22:43.341 --> 22:44.933
Shit.

23:00.558 --> 23:01.650
Olivia!

23:04.362 --> 23:06.387
You miss your train last night?

23:29.287 --> 23:30.754
Hey.

23:31.356 --> 23:33.449
Brought you a cafe con leche.

23:33.525 --> 23:34.753
Thanks.

23:34.826 --> 23:36.123
Whoa.

23:37.795 --> 23:39.262
So, what happened?

23:39.330 --> 23:40.854
What do you mean?

23:40.932 --> 23:43.127
I been here for six weeks.
I don't get two words.

23:43.201 --> 23:45.135
You're here 24 hours.
It's sleepover time?

23:45.203 --> 23:47.034
She brought me
a bottle of bourbon.

23:47.105 --> 23:50.074
Are you serious?

23:50.141 --> 23:52.132
You should get that.
It's probably her.

23:52.210 --> 23:53.734
My phone's disconnected.

23:53.811 --> 23:55.938
Something's ringing.

24:01.786 --> 24:04.084
She left her phone.
Sweet.

24:07.058 --> 24:09.652
So, what happened?

24:09.727 --> 24:11.695
- Be right back.
- Yo!

24:11.763 --> 24:13.321
Hold on!

24:14.899 --> 24:16.332
Come on.
Tell me what happened.

24:16.401 --> 24:19.268
You're not going anywhere
today, are you?

24:19.337 --> 24:21.532
I'd like to return this.
Do you know where she lives?

24:21.606 --> 24:23.801
I'd freeze her out.
But that's just me.

24:23.875 --> 24:26.309
You're very lucky, bro.
She's a pretty woman.

24:26.377 --> 24:29.278
She got that sexy, smart
older-woman thing going.

24:29.347 --> 24:31.212
Do you know where she lives?

24:31.316 --> 24:33.784
She's on Green Pond Road.
Three miles down the road.

24:33.851 --> 24:35.045
Hey, listen.

24:35.153 --> 24:37.986
If you guys do something later,
can I join you?

24:38.056 --> 24:39.921
We're not gonna do something.

24:39.991 --> 24:42.084
I know.
But if you do, can I join you?

24:42.160 --> 24:43.923
We're not gonna
do something later.

24:43.995 --> 24:46.429
Okay, but if you do?

24:46.864 --> 24:47.796
- Okay.
- Cool.

24:47.865 --> 24:50.095
Hey.
You the man.

24:52.704 --> 24:54.399
You the man.

25:27.839 --> 25:29.170
Hi, leave a message.

25:30.341 --> 25:32.002
Olivia?

25:32.076 --> 25:35.068
Are you there?
Liv?

25:35.146 --> 25:37.944
Look, I really need to
talk to you now.

25:38.049 --> 25:41.985
It's important,
so please call me back.

25:43.287 --> 25:45.585
And I hope you're well.

25:45.657 --> 25:46.248
Okay.

25:46.324 --> 25:48.690
Bye.

25:50.695 --> 25:52.219
Shit.

25:56.968 --> 25:58.765
Janice?

26:01.205 --> 26:02.035
Hi!

26:02.106 --> 26:03.698
- Hey.
- I had a client down here.

26:03.775 --> 26:06.710
- I thought I'd drop by.
- Oh, how nice.

26:06.778 --> 26:09.474
You know, I hate to do this,
but I've actually gotta run.

26:09.547 --> 26:11.640
- Well, that's too bad.
- I know.

26:11.749 --> 26:14.149
Our crazy lives.

26:14.218 --> 26:15.947
How are you?

26:17.188 --> 26:19.383
I'm good.
I'm good.

26:19.457 --> 26:20.947
I gotta go.

26:21.059 --> 26:23.527
Oh, that's okay.
We ought to set a date.

26:23.594 --> 26:25.255
- Definitely.
- I would love that.

26:25.329 --> 26:26.694
Oh, you forgot your phone.

26:26.764 --> 26:29.164
Just leave it.
Bye.

26:46.150 --> 26:47.310
Aah!

26:47.852 --> 26:50.514
Oh, I'm so sorry.

26:51.022 --> 26:54.116
Oh, God, I didn't know anybody
was in here.

26:54.692 --> 26:56.887
Can I help you?

26:56.961 --> 26:58.087
Check this book out?

26:58.162 --> 26:59.527
Okay.

27:00.031 --> 27:02.761
Um, do you have a library card?

27:02.834 --> 27:04.597
No.

27:04.669 --> 27:06.569
Okay, well, do you live in town?

27:06.637 --> 27:07.569
Yes.

27:07.638 --> 27:10.539
Okay, well,
I need a proof of address.

27:10.608 --> 27:12.235
If you could bring
in a piece of mail,

27:12.310 --> 27:13.538
then I can give you a card.

27:13.611 --> 27:15.442
You can put it on mine.

27:15.513 --> 27:18.107
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:19.317 --> 27:21.342
No, thanks.
I'll come back.

27:21.452 --> 27:23.477
You sure?

27:24.055 --> 27:24.987
Yes.

27:25.056 --> 27:28.651
Sorry about last night.
I overstayed my welcome.

27:35.166 --> 27:36.565
Bye.

27:36.634 --> 27:38.499
Bye.

27:40.638 --> 27:41.570
Hey, Emily.

27:41.639 --> 27:43.800
Oh, God.
I just screamed in his face.

27:43.875 --> 27:46.139
Oh.
It's all right.

28:03.895 --> 28:06.363
Olivia left it.

28:06.430 --> 28:08.591
You're my hero, dawg.

28:11.669 --> 28:13.136
Hey, Fin.

28:13.204 --> 28:14.899
You want a cold one?

28:21.012 --> 28:22.343
So, what else?

28:25.149 --> 28:26.810
Hey, Fin, I'm taking off!

28:26.918 --> 28:27.885
Manana, baby!

28:53.678 --> 28:55.771
Hey, what are you doing?

28:56.981 --> 29:01.315
I'm searching the trucks
for the company name.

29:01.385 --> 29:03.683
Well, these are trains,
not trucks.

29:03.754 --> 29:06.848
The wheels on the trains
are called the trucks.

29:07.959 --> 29:09.221
What grade are you in?

29:09.293 --> 29:11.887
I'm finished with school.

29:11.963 --> 29:14.090
Are you a midget?

29:14.565 --> 29:15.930
No.

29:16.400 --> 29:17.890
Where do you live?

29:17.969 --> 29:19.561
In the depot.

29:19.637 --> 29:21.798
My name is Cleo.

29:23.641 --> 29:25.438
My name's Fin.

29:26.310 --> 29:27.709
Bye.

29:36.654 --> 29:37.586
Hey, Fin!

29:37.655 --> 29:39.122
Wakey, wakey, baby!

29:47.798 --> 29:50.164
Hey, I'll be at the truck.

29:54.538 --> 29:55.527
Hey, Joe!

29:55.606 --> 29:57.198
Big Joe!

29:57.275 --> 29:58.970
What's up, fellas?

29:59.377 --> 30:02.403
Oh, look at the stash.
Ron Jeremy.

30:02.480 --> 30:03.310
Thank you.

30:03.381 --> 30:04.678
I'll get your coffees.

30:04.782 --> 30:06.409
You know how I like it.

30:09.820 --> 30:11.981
- All right.
- Thanks, bro.

30:12.890 --> 30:14.255
Hey, how's your old man?

30:14.325 --> 30:15.451
He's doing better.

30:15.526 --> 30:17.790
Hey, let me get one of those.

30:17.862 --> 30:19.329
How long is he gonna be out?

30:19.397 --> 30:22.366
Holy shit.
Look at that.

30:24.268 --> 30:25.929
It's fucking Mini-Me.

30:26.003 --> 30:26.628
Hey.

30:26.704 --> 30:29.036
"Da plane!
Da plane!"

30:29.106 --> 30:30.368
- Fin!
- You know him?

30:30.441 --> 30:32.534
Fin!

30:32.610 --> 30:34.100
"Hey, boss!
Hey, boss!"

30:34.178 --> 30:35.110
Shut the fuck up.

30:35.179 --> 30:36.305
- Hey!
- What?

30:36.380 --> 30:38.109
Shut up.

30:39.383 --> 30:42.181
- Why don't you ease up, Joey?
- Two bucks.

30:43.387 --> 30:44.615
- I got it.
- I'm light, man.

30:44.689 --> 30:46.281
Okay.
Of course you're light.

30:46.357 --> 30:49.155
Hey, Joe, we're still playing
softball every Friday night.

30:49.226 --> 30:50.488
Why don't you come by, man?

30:50.561 --> 30:52.586
You should bring
your little buddy.

30:52.663 --> 30:53.891
How funny would that be?

30:53.965 --> 30:56.229
Him walking up to the plate,
you know?

30:56.300 --> 30:59.792
It's like, "Throw one in there!
Throw one in there!"

30:59.870 --> 31:02.498
- All right, see ya, Joe.
- Take it easy, man.

31:24.495 --> 31:25.519
Hello, Olivia.

31:25.596 --> 31:26.585
Hi.

31:26.664 --> 31:28.859
One cafe con leche,
extra sugar, coming up.

31:28.933 --> 31:30.833
- Thanks.
- All right.

31:32.470 --> 31:33.937
Gonna pop in on Fin?

31:34.005 --> 31:37.668
What? Oh, no.
I just drove past him.

31:38.242 --> 31:39.209
Where?

31:39.276 --> 31:41.972
The pond on Lake End Road.

31:44.882 --> 31:46.679
Tell you what.

31:46.784 --> 31:52.086
This one's on the house
if you do me one favor.

31:52.156 --> 31:53.851
What?

31:58.329 --> 32:00.297
Do you like it out here, Olivia?

32:00.364 --> 32:01.490
Yeah.

32:01.565 --> 32:04.261
- What do you do for fun?
- I don't.

32:05.703 --> 32:07.671
Me neither.
It sucks, right?

32:07.738 --> 32:10.536
There's not enough cool people
around here, you know?

32:14.512 --> 32:16.537
- Do you live alone?
- Yep.

32:18.015 --> 32:19.505
Do you not like me or something?

32:19.617 --> 32:20.311
Why?

32:20.418 --> 32:22.886
You're not exactly pleasant
towards me.

32:33.497 --> 32:35.158
Are you gonna say hi to Fin?

32:35.232 --> 32:36.631
I gotta get going.

32:36.700 --> 32:39.567
I know he wanted to thank you
for the book.

32:40.538 --> 32:42.096
Bye, Joe.

32:55.219 --> 32:56.618
Hey.

32:56.987 --> 32:58.545
What's going on?

33:00.224 --> 33:01.486
Olivia says hi.

33:01.559 --> 33:03.390
She just gave me a ride.

33:03.727 --> 33:05.388
What are you doing?

33:07.698 --> 33:09.461
Watching trains.

33:11.569 --> 33:13.503
What's this?

33:14.438 --> 33:15.598
A train guide.

33:15.673 --> 33:17.334
Can I look at it?

33:22.046 --> 33:24.344
What time did
the last train come?

33:29.120 --> 33:31.486
Hour and 23 minutes ago.

33:31.555 --> 33:33.079
Seriously?

33:34.158 --> 33:35.887
Holy boring.

33:37.995 --> 33:40.054
Mind if I hang out a while?

33:43.667 --> 33:45.066
No.

34:17.034 --> 34:18.899
- Are you hungry?
- No.

34:18.969 --> 34:20.333
Thirsty?

34:20.404 --> 34:21.563
No.

34:21.639 --> 34:23.800
You don't really say much,
do you?

34:23.873 --> 34:24.806
Guess not.

34:24.875 --> 34:26.433
Guess not.

34:26.510 --> 34:27.806
Hey, hold on.

34:27.878 --> 34:29.469
Olivia!

34:29.547 --> 34:31.014
Hey!

34:31.581 --> 34:32.674
- Oh.
- Hey.

34:32.783 --> 34:35.809
You missed a great day
of train watching.

34:35.920 --> 34:37.614
Oh.

34:38.088 --> 34:39.578
Maybe next time.

34:39.690 --> 34:41.351
Hey, Olivia!

34:41.425 --> 34:43.120
Yeah?

34:43.694 --> 34:46.219
Could you give us a ride home?
My feet are killing me.

34:46.297 --> 34:49.322
Uh...

34:53.337 --> 34:54.702
Man, when you guys taste this,

34:54.772 --> 34:57.764
you're gonna be so happy
we did this, trust me.

35:13.591 --> 35:14.558
Anybody?

35:14.625 --> 35:15.557
No, thanks.

35:15.626 --> 35:17.184
Fin.

35:17.261 --> 35:18.353
Everyone's doing it.

35:18.429 --> 35:20.021
It's there if you want it.

35:20.097 --> 35:23.624
Hey, Fin.
Let me ask you a question.

35:23.701 --> 35:24.929
What do you think of Amtrak?

35:25.002 --> 35:27.334
I don't know.
I've never ridden on Amtrak.

35:27.404 --> 35:29.599
- You've never ridden Amtrak?
- No.

35:29.673 --> 35:30.765
That's weird, right?

35:30.841 --> 35:33.105
I thought that's what
you train guys did.

35:36.347 --> 35:38.144
How's your dad, Joe?

35:38.249 --> 35:40.479
Well, he's driving me nuts,
but he's better.

35:40.584 --> 35:41.881
Thanks.

35:44.655 --> 35:49.115
Chuleta con cebolla,
con arroz con frijoles.

35:49.193 --> 35:51.753
Cuban surprise, in other words.

36:00.871 --> 36:02.532
Bring 'em in.

36:02.606 --> 36:04.403
What?

36:04.475 --> 36:05.874
Grace.

36:05.943 --> 36:07.774
- Really?
- Yeah, we gotta give thanks.

36:07.845 --> 36:10.040
Come on.
Bring them in.

36:10.114 --> 36:11.581
Hands around.

36:13.517 --> 36:16.418
- Who wants to say it?
- You.

36:16.487 --> 36:21.151
God, thank you for letting us
sit here and enjoy this meal.

36:21.225 --> 36:23.420
Please watch over everybody.

36:23.494 --> 36:25.189
Please let my dad heal

36:25.262 --> 36:27.662
'cause he's driving me
fucking crazy.

36:27.731 --> 36:29.460
Anybody you guys
want to mention?

36:29.533 --> 36:30.465
No.

36:30.534 --> 36:31.558
Amen.

36:31.635 --> 36:33.102
Let's dig in.

36:34.471 --> 36:36.735
- Olivia, plate.
- Oh.

36:40.044 --> 36:41.477
Fin?

36:43.480 --> 36:45.675
Let me ask you a question, Fin.

36:45.783 --> 36:47.614
Do you people have clubs?

36:48.752 --> 36:49.946
What do you mean?

36:50.054 --> 36:52.488
You know, like
a "train of the month" club.

36:52.556 --> 36:54.615
Yeah, there are clubs.

36:54.692 --> 36:56.489
What do you guys do?

36:56.560 --> 36:59.051
Well, they get together,

36:59.129 --> 37:00.858
and they look at
old photographs,

37:00.931 --> 37:02.364
and sometimes
they watch a movie.

37:02.433 --> 37:04.128
Watch a movie?
That's cool.

37:06.070 --> 37:08.470
Oh, shit.
Sorry.

37:09.039 --> 37:10.734
This looks good.

37:23.687 --> 37:27.521
Uh, what kind of movies?

37:27.591 --> 37:30.116
Well, there are people
called train chasers.

37:30.194 --> 37:33.254
They follow a train,
and they film it.

37:33.330 --> 37:34.661
Are you a train chaser?

37:34.732 --> 37:35.926
No.

37:36.367 --> 37:37.425
How come?

37:37.501 --> 37:39.332
I don't know how to drive a car.

37:39.403 --> 37:41.462
And I don't own a camera.

37:41.972 --> 37:43.564
That'd do it.

37:43.640 --> 37:45.164
I gotta split.

37:45.242 --> 37:46.834
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

37:46.910 --> 37:48.207
That was my dad.

37:48.278 --> 37:50.041
He can't find his medication.

37:50.114 --> 37:51.604
Totally sucks.

37:54.985 --> 37:56.452
This was fun, right?

37:56.520 --> 37:57.612
Yeah.

37:57.721 --> 37:58.551
Cool.

37:58.622 --> 38:01.420
All right, well,
we'll do it again, all right?

38:05.562 --> 38:07.496
Bon appetit.

38:32.823 --> 38:34.290
This is really good.

38:34.358 --> 38:36.292
Yes.

38:38.662 --> 38:40.493
We don't have to talk.
We can just eat.

38:40.564 --> 38:42.088
I'm cool with that.

38:42.166 --> 38:43.633
Okay.

38:55.412 --> 38:58.347
Hey, Sancho Panza,
what's this called again?

38:58.949 --> 39:00.177
Walking the right-of-way.

39:00.284 --> 39:01.615
How am I doing?

39:02.085 --> 39:03.677
You're doing okay.

39:03.787 --> 39:06.085
I told you
I was a good walker, bro.

39:12.362 --> 39:13.294
Boom!

39:13.363 --> 39:14.853
Give me another one.

39:17.534 --> 39:18.796
That one?

39:27.144 --> 39:27.872
Boom!

39:30.514 --> 39:31.742
Hi.

39:31.849 --> 39:34.113
- Hey.
- Hi.

39:34.218 --> 39:36.152
Did you get any mail yet?

39:36.220 --> 39:37.517
No.

39:39.423 --> 39:40.321
Bye.

39:40.390 --> 39:42.551
You're fucking
unbelievable, bro.

39:45.896 --> 39:48.262
I don't suppose you
want to grab a beer.

39:48.332 --> 39:50.197
No, thanks.

39:50.267 --> 39:51.757
You gotta get over
the bar thing.

39:51.835 --> 39:52.927
Seriously.

40:11.088 --> 40:14.819
All aboard! Tickets, please!

40:14.892 --> 40:18.259
Next stop, Cleveland, Charity,

40:18.328 --> 40:20.159
Newark, San Diego,

40:20.230 --> 40:23.757
California, Winston.

40:24.501 --> 40:26.662
And San Diego, California.

40:26.737 --> 40:28.637
Next stop.
Thank you very much.

40:28.705 --> 40:29.763
All aboard.

40:36.146 --> 40:37.272
Hi.

40:37.381 --> 40:38.814
Hi.

40:39.816 --> 40:42.148
What are you doing?

40:42.219 --> 40:43.846
I was looking for Fin.

40:43.954 --> 40:45.546
What's your name?

40:46.089 --> 40:48.580
Cleo.
What's your name?

40:48.692 --> 40:50.091
Olivia.

40:51.528 --> 40:53.496
Are you Fin's mother?

40:53.564 --> 40:55.259
No.

40:55.332 --> 40:57.664
No, I'm just his friend.

40:57.734 --> 41:01.135
Do you want to see
my spike collection?

41:01.204 --> 41:03.536
I don't know.
What's a spike collection?

41:03.607 --> 41:06.041
You know, like, train spikes?

41:06.109 --> 41:07.576
Oh.

41:08.078 --> 41:09.602
Actually,
that sounds kind of cool.

41:09.680 --> 41:10.704
I'd like that.

41:10.781 --> 41:13.011
Come on.

41:13.116 --> 41:14.606
I don't need a ticket?

41:14.718 --> 41:15.685
No.

41:15.786 --> 41:17.515
- You sure?
- Yeah.

41:18.689 --> 41:20.816
Be careful.

41:20.891 --> 41:23.792
Hey, how about from
L.A. to San Francisco?

41:23.860 --> 41:25.623
The Starlight Express.

41:25.696 --> 41:27.357
That's gotta be
fucking beautiful.

41:27.431 --> 41:29.831
Yeah, but I think
the Zephyr would be better.

41:29.900 --> 41:32.528
The Zephyr?
Where does that go?

41:32.603 --> 41:34.969
Through the Rocky Mountains
outside of Denver.

41:35.038 --> 41:36.938
Great mountain passes.

41:41.378 --> 41:42.402
Hey, Fin!

41:42.479 --> 41:44.845
Somebody left you something.

41:49.987 --> 41:51.818
Ooh, what's that?

41:55.759 --> 41:58.091
"Happy moviemaking.
Olivia."

41:58.161 --> 42:00.186
What's it for?

42:00.263 --> 42:01.195
Train chasing.

42:01.264 --> 42:03.095
No, it's not.

42:03.166 --> 42:04.656
Yeah, it is.

42:05.836 --> 42:07.599
- Can I see?
- Nope.

42:28.091 --> 42:30.719
Hey.
I know. I'm late.

42:32.062 --> 42:34.428
My pop was up coughing
all night.

42:34.498 --> 42:35.988
He kept me up.

42:37.367 --> 42:39.597
Hey, grab those chairs,
would you?

42:40.404 --> 42:42.338
Hey, man, question.

42:42.406 --> 42:44.306
Why don't you ever sit
in the lounge?

42:44.374 --> 42:45.671
The lounge?

42:45.742 --> 42:47.369
The lounge.

42:48.578 --> 42:50.546
I like to read when I eat.

42:50.614 --> 42:52.377
You can't read in the lounge?

42:52.482 --> 42:53.813
You'll talk to me.

42:54.818 --> 42:56.445
Not if you don't want me to.

42:56.553 --> 42:57.611
Fin, I promise.

42:57.721 --> 42:59.780
I'll read, too.
I got a book in here.

43:01.958 --> 43:03.118
Here.

43:03.560 --> 43:05.152
I'll read, too.

43:16.440 --> 43:18.533
This isn't so bad, right?

43:19.042 --> 43:20.407
Right.

43:22.946 --> 43:24.937
You reading about trains?

43:25.315 --> 43:26.782
Yep.

43:26.850 --> 43:27.714
You know what?

43:27.818 --> 43:29.786
You should get a job
on the railroad.

43:29.853 --> 43:33.380
You said you weren't gonna talk
to me if I sat here, Joe.

43:33.490 --> 43:36.084
I haven't said anything in,
like, 20 minutes.

43:40.764 --> 43:41.662
Nine.

43:41.732 --> 43:44.530
- You timed me?
- Mm-hmm.

43:45.535 --> 43:47.400
That's cold, bro.

43:48.405 --> 43:50.566
Hey, you gonna walk
the right-of-way today?

43:50.640 --> 43:52.267
No.

43:52.342 --> 43:53.707
Tomorrow?

43:54.578 --> 43:56.136
Yeah.

44:05.956 --> 44:09.483
The number for Olivia Harris
on Green Pond Road.

44:09.559 --> 44:10.821
Thank you.

44:13.029 --> 44:15.293
What?
Go back to your book, man.

44:39.923 --> 44:42.153
I don't think we should do this.

44:42.225 --> 44:43.522
Seriously?

44:43.593 --> 44:44.890
Come on.
You can do it.

44:44.961 --> 44:47.452
This is a little scary.

44:55.872 --> 44:57.635
This is really beautiful,
Fin.

44:57.707 --> 45:01.108
You sure there's no trains
on this track?

45:01.178 --> 45:04.204
No, it stops right down there.

45:04.881 --> 45:06.610
I'm starving.

45:06.716 --> 45:08.149
You want some beef jerky?

45:08.218 --> 45:09.913
Absolutely.

45:10.887 --> 45:12.752
You had it all this time?

45:15.926 --> 45:17.325
Want some?

45:17.394 --> 45:18.861
I'll pass.

45:24.768 --> 45:26.395
Fuckin' delicious.

45:29.873 --> 45:31.670
Let me have a piece.

45:36.046 --> 45:37.673
Fuckin' good.

45:39.749 --> 45:41.683
So beefy.

45:45.822 --> 45:47.756
This is good.

45:58.168 --> 46:00.363
That was a good walk.

46:02.839 --> 46:05.740
Why is it called
"walking the right-of-way"?

46:05.809 --> 46:08.175
It's complicated.
You know, it's, uh...

46:10.080 --> 46:12.708
I'll let Fin answer this one.
Fin?

46:13.316 --> 46:15.011
When the railroads
were being built,

46:15.118 --> 46:18.884
the government took
a lot of private land,

46:18.955 --> 46:21.423
saying the railroad needed
the right-of-way

46:21.524 --> 46:23.287
through the property.

46:24.728 --> 46:26.525
Hey, can we get some sodas?

46:26.596 --> 46:28.427
We're closed!

46:28.498 --> 46:30.728
I'll play soccer with ya,
though!

46:34.638 --> 46:36.970
Ooh!

46:41.311 --> 46:44.212
- He does enjoy life.
- You guys want to play?

46:49.386 --> 46:50.853
Let me have it!

46:50.954 --> 46:53.115
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

46:53.189 --> 46:54.816
Whoa!

46:54.891 --> 46:55.949
Whoa!

47:04.401 --> 47:06.062
- Ooh.
- Jesus!

47:06.136 --> 47:07.865
Are you okay?

47:10.407 --> 47:14.104
Uh, I'm gonna... I'm gonna go.

47:14.678 --> 47:17.146
I'll see you later.
Bye.

47:17.213 --> 47:18.680
Bye.

47:19.983 --> 47:21.974
Olivia!

47:22.085 --> 47:23.450
Hey!

47:23.520 --> 47:26.250
Olivia!

47:26.323 --> 47:27.881
Where's she going?

47:57.087 --> 47:59.453
This is Joe Oramas
reporting live

47:59.522 --> 48:02.889
from the inside of Gorgeous
Frank's Hot Dog Emporium.

48:02.993 --> 48:05.257
Open every day from 7:00
to 3:00. Keep it on me.

48:05.328 --> 48:08.354
Camerawork by...
turn it on you, turn it on you.

48:09.466 --> 48:11.593
Finbar McBride!

48:11.968 --> 48:14.266
Whoo!
We're train-chasing, baby!

48:17.173 --> 48:20.472
Coming at you live
from the Susquehanna train!

48:20.543 --> 48:22.704
Whoo!

48:28.718 --> 48:31.186
This fuckin' train is huge!

48:31.254 --> 48:33.381
Yeah!

48:37.527 --> 48:39.825
Whoo!

48:54.511 --> 48:57.071
Hi, leave a message.

48:57.147 --> 48:59.843
Olivia, hey, what's up?
Scorsese and Coppola here.

48:59.949 --> 49:01.507
Listen, we're done
with the movie.

49:01.618 --> 49:02.642
We want to screen it.

49:02.752 --> 49:06.017
We can either do it at Fin's
pathetic little hovel of a home

49:06.089 --> 49:07.420
or we can do it
at your beautiful home

49:07.490 --> 49:08.252
with your beautiful self.

49:08.324 --> 49:10.224
Get back to us.

49:12.896 --> 49:13.726
Shit.

49:13.797 --> 49:15.526
Coming!

49:33.216 --> 49:34.649
You're early.

49:36.019 --> 49:37.748
Are we early?

49:37.821 --> 49:38.719
No.

49:38.788 --> 49:40.346
We're not early.

49:40.457 --> 49:43.426
Well, there's wine and beer
in the fridge

49:43.493 --> 49:46.758
and liquor in that funny
little cabinet in the corner.

49:46.830 --> 49:49.264
I'll be right back down.

49:56.840 --> 49:57.966
Holy shit.

49:58.041 --> 49:59.303
I heard that, Joe.

49:59.375 --> 50:01.639
What? I was just talking
about the view.

50:01.711 --> 50:03.269
Bullshit.

50:03.346 --> 50:04.836
It's just that
they're a little...

50:04.914 --> 50:06.939
I don't want to hear it, Joe.

50:07.550 --> 50:09.108
What do you think?

50:11.754 --> 50:13.119
What?

50:19.028 --> 50:20.791
Hey, Olivia!

50:20.864 --> 50:22.456
You got a garlic press?

50:22.532 --> 50:23.396
No.

50:23.466 --> 50:25.400
How can you not have
a garlic press?

50:25.468 --> 50:27.402
Still no.

50:27.470 --> 50:28.994
All right.
You keep talkin'.

50:29.072 --> 50:31.506
I'm gonna go cook
without the garlic press.

50:31.574 --> 50:33.599
I'm not used to having people
in my house.

50:33.676 --> 50:35.610
Especially loud people.

50:35.678 --> 50:37.646
It's a nice house.

50:38.148 --> 50:39.843
Yeah.

50:40.216 --> 50:43.208
David bought it
as a getaway place, so...

50:43.319 --> 50:45.787
I moved down here and got away.

50:45.855 --> 50:47.584
Where did you used to live?

50:47.657 --> 50:49.352
Princeton.

50:49.425 --> 50:51.484
I know.
I didn't get very far.

50:51.561 --> 50:53.927
I just couldn't stay there
another minute.

50:53.997 --> 50:57.262
Everyone looking at me.
The poor woman whose son died.

50:59.969 --> 51:01.834
How about you?

51:01.905 --> 51:04.465
What made you pick Newfoundland?

51:05.742 --> 51:08.404
I wanted to live near Joe.

51:11.414 --> 51:12.403
Guys.

51:12.515 --> 51:16.417
Would you come up here and talk?
Seriously, this sucks.

51:41.911 --> 51:44.106
Finbar McBride!

51:44.180 --> 51:46.876
Whoo, we're train-chasing, baby!

51:46.983 --> 51:48.473
Trains are really cool.

51:48.585 --> 51:50.109
They are.

51:52.388 --> 51:54.151
So are horses.

51:54.224 --> 51:56.055
Whoo!

51:56.125 --> 51:57.387
What?

51:59.862 --> 52:02.023
I was just thinking that.

52:02.932 --> 52:04.763
Give me the joint, man.

52:06.603 --> 52:08.867
This fuckin' train is huge!

52:09.239 --> 52:11.639
Shh. Shh.

52:12.008 --> 52:13.202
Yeah!

52:19.082 --> 52:21.550
Have you ever been in love, Fin?

52:24.821 --> 52:26.152
Yeah.

52:28.725 --> 52:30.352
What happened?

52:34.197 --> 52:36.859
I was young...

52:37.500 --> 52:40.162
and, uh...

52:40.236 --> 52:42.033
really angry.

52:43.673 --> 52:45.664
About what?

52:48.378 --> 52:49.902
Um...

52:52.582 --> 52:54.311
Being a dwarf.

52:58.554 --> 53:00.886
You know, it's, uh...

53:03.960 --> 53:07.418
It's really funny how...

53:08.498 --> 53:10.898
different people...

53:10.967 --> 53:14.425
see me and treat me.

53:18.708 --> 53:27.207
Because I'm actually just
a very simple, boring person.

53:32.221 --> 53:33.688
What about you?

53:33.790 --> 53:36.588
Are you still in love
with David?

53:37.960 --> 53:39.427
Yes.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.968
I don't think he's moving.

53:46.903 --> 53:48.393
I'll wake him.

53:48.471 --> 53:51.531
No, you're not gonna have
any luck.

53:52.842 --> 53:55.538
- Maybe I should go.
- No. No.

53:55.611 --> 53:58.045
You're not leaving.
You're both staying here.

53:58.114 --> 54:01.481
And don't argue
because I'm just too tired.

54:01.551 --> 54:03.280
Would you like some water?

54:03.386 --> 54:05.718
No. I'm all right.
Thanks.

54:13.162 --> 54:15.221
- You can get under the covers.
- No.

54:15.298 --> 54:16.230
I'm fine.

54:16.299 --> 54:18.164
I brought you some water anyway.

54:18.234 --> 54:21.067
And a towel.

54:22.939 --> 54:24.702
That's Sam, huh?

54:24.774 --> 54:26.401
Yeah.

54:38.755 --> 54:41.246
He fell off the monkey bars.

54:44.260 --> 54:46.990
I turned my head for a second.

54:50.066 --> 54:52.159
Looks like a happy kid.

54:55.271 --> 54:56.670
He was.

55:01.778 --> 55:03.245
Well...

55:03.646 --> 55:06.080
- Good night.
- Good night.

55:57.567 --> 55:58.556
Hi.

55:59.402 --> 56:00.300
Who are you?

56:00.369 --> 56:01.734
I'm Fin.

56:02.572 --> 56:03.664
Where's Olivia?

56:03.739 --> 56:06.071
I think she's upstairs sleeping.

56:06.843 --> 56:08.333
Hey, you're Olivia's ex.

56:08.411 --> 56:09.639
I just saw your picture
in the kitchen.

56:09.712 --> 56:11.077
Yes.

56:11.848 --> 56:13.577
I'm Joe.

56:13.683 --> 56:16.811
I think Olivia's sleeping, man.
Tore it up last night.

56:16.919 --> 56:18.113
Huh.

56:22.859 --> 56:24.554
David?

56:24.627 --> 56:26.356
Hi.

56:26.429 --> 56:27.691
What are you doing here?

56:27.763 --> 56:30.459
I wanted to talk to you.
And you won't call me back.

56:30.533 --> 56:31.898
I didn't feel like talking.

56:31.968 --> 56:34.630
Yeah, yeah, I got that much.

56:38.841 --> 56:41.901
Can you guys leave us alone?

56:43.212 --> 56:44.770
Thanks.

56:45.214 --> 56:46.806
Are you gonna be okay?

56:47.450 --> 56:48.781
Yeah.

57:01.497 --> 57:02.987
You wanna explain that?

57:03.065 --> 57:04.896
- No.
- No, what?

57:04.967 --> 57:07.060
I'd just like to know
what the hell's going on.

57:07.136 --> 57:08.797
No, I came all the way down here

57:08.871 --> 57:10.099
because you won't pick up
the phone.

57:10.172 --> 57:11.696
I have nothing to say to you!

57:11.774 --> 57:14.436
Don't walk away from me.
Can you listen to me?

57:30.927 --> 57:32.861
Fin!

57:40.570 --> 57:41.229
Here, Fin.

57:41.304 --> 57:45.035
It's a permission slip
so you can speak at my school.

57:49.412 --> 57:51.642
I can't speak
at your school, Cleo.

57:51.714 --> 57:52.703
Yes, you can.

57:52.782 --> 57:55.012
You can pick any Friday
that you want.

57:55.117 --> 57:56.607
I'm sorry.
I can't.

57:56.719 --> 57:58.209
Why?

57:58.321 --> 57:59.811
It's just not something
I can do.

57:59.922 --> 58:01.253
You have to!

58:01.324 --> 58:02.518
I'm sorry.

58:02.592 --> 58:06.084
But I already told everyone
you were coming!

58:06.162 --> 58:07.060
I'm sorry, Cleo.

58:07.129 --> 58:08.323
No, you're not.

58:08.397 --> 58:10.922
If you were sorry,
then you would come.

58:15.438 --> 58:17.872
What was that all about?

58:23.613 --> 58:26.309
I guess no coffee
for Olivia today.

58:27.650 --> 58:29.049
No.

58:29.118 --> 58:30.676
Guess not.

58:54.543 --> 58:56.602
I didn't like that guy, man.

58:57.346 --> 58:58.005
Who?

58:58.080 --> 58:59.775
Olivia's ex.

59:00.449 --> 59:02.178
Uptight white guy.

59:04.453 --> 59:06.444
Can I ask you
a personal question?

59:06.555 --> 59:08.250
Sure.

59:08.691 --> 59:10.818
You've had sex, right?

59:12.261 --> 59:13.626
Yes.

59:14.296 --> 59:16.457
With a regular-sized chick?

59:17.400 --> 59:18.799
Yeah.

59:19.368 --> 59:21.632
With a regular-sized chick.

59:22.571 --> 59:25.165
You ever had it
with someone your own size?

59:29.211 --> 59:30.508
No.

59:31.080 --> 59:32.377
Do you wanna?

59:32.481 --> 59:34.176
I don't want to talk
about this, Joe.

59:34.283 --> 59:37.548
- Why?
- I just... I just don't.

01:00:26.736 --> 01:00:27.395
Hi.

01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:28.596
Hi.

01:00:28.671 --> 01:00:29.569
I have my bill.

01:00:29.638 --> 01:00:31.128
Oh. Cool.

01:00:31.207 --> 01:00:33.402
I can make you out
a card right now.

01:00:35.444 --> 01:00:38.106
I just need you
to fill that out.

01:00:38.981 --> 01:00:41.711
There you go.
And I'll get your card.

01:00:45.788 --> 01:00:47.779
Your first name is Finbar?

01:00:47.890 --> 01:00:49.221
Yes.

01:00:49.291 --> 01:00:51.020
My name's Emily.

01:00:51.093 --> 01:00:52.025
Hi.

01:00:52.595 --> 01:00:53.823
Hi.

01:00:57.867 --> 01:00:59.858
You have a nice chin.

01:01:03.205 --> 01:01:05.036
Thanks.

01:01:08.944 --> 01:01:11.105
A nice chin?

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:12.408
Yeah.

01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:14.714
Seriously?

01:01:14.817 --> 01:01:15.977
Yeah.

01:01:16.986 --> 01:01:18.544
Fuckin' weird.

01:01:28.030 --> 01:01:29.691
That's Olivia.

01:01:30.132 --> 01:01:31.963
Hey! Olivia!

01:01:32.701 --> 01:01:33.668
That was her, right?

01:01:33.736 --> 01:01:35.897
I think so.

01:01:36.572 --> 01:01:38.096
What was that?

01:01:38.174 --> 01:01:39.368
She had to see us, right?

01:01:45.648 --> 01:01:46.706
Shit.

01:01:53.255 --> 01:01:55.223
It's my pop.
We're going to the Mill tonight.

01:01:55.291 --> 01:01:57.350
He wants to know
if you want to join us.

01:01:57.426 --> 01:01:58.552
Okay.

01:01:58.627 --> 01:02:00.788
Really?

01:02:00.863 --> 01:02:02.125
Yeah.

01:02:11.307 --> 01:02:13.332
Yeah, Good to Go.

01:02:13.876 --> 01:02:15.673
Yeah, okay.
Address?

01:02:15.744 --> 01:02:18.907
34 Green Pond Road.
Yeah. Name?

01:02:18.981 --> 01:02:20.949
Harris.
All right.

01:02:21.016 --> 01:02:23.143
Right, okay.
Two of those.

01:02:23.252 --> 01:02:24.219
Yeah.

01:02:24.286 --> 01:02:27.221
All right.
Yeah. Is that it?

01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:29.382
Okay, my delivery boy's
out of the store now,

01:02:29.458 --> 01:02:31.551
so it's gonna be
a couple of hours.

01:02:32.261 --> 01:02:33.888
Yeah, okay. Bye.

01:02:34.463 --> 01:02:36.556
Excuse me.

01:02:36.632 --> 01:02:39.430
That delivery for Olivia Harris.
I'll take it to her.

01:02:39.501 --> 01:02:41.128
What?

01:02:41.203 --> 01:02:44.070
She's a friend of mine,
and I'm...

01:02:44.139 --> 01:02:46.107
I'm gonna go that way.

01:02:46.675 --> 01:02:48.540
You're gonna have to pay for it.

01:02:48.611 --> 01:02:50.772
- Yeah. Sure.
- Before you leave the store.

01:02:50.846 --> 01:02:51.938
Yeah.

01:03:08.497 --> 01:03:09.486
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:03:09.565 --> 01:03:11.294
I got your groceries.

01:03:11.367 --> 01:03:12.698
I was in the store
when you called,

01:03:12.768 --> 01:03:14.429
so I thought
I'd bring them over for you.

01:03:14.503 --> 01:03:16.437
Thank you.
How much?

01:03:16.505 --> 01:03:17.472
How are you?

01:03:17.539 --> 01:03:19.530
I'm fine.

01:03:19.608 --> 01:03:21.235
How much?

01:03:24.413 --> 01:03:26.278
$20.

01:03:29.518 --> 01:03:31.543
I got it.
I got it.

01:03:32.087 --> 01:03:34.146
Thank you.
Bye.

01:04:02.584 --> 01:04:04.779
Can I get you something?

01:04:04.887 --> 01:04:07.321
Yeah.
Just a beer.

01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:16.125
Anything else?

01:04:19.101 --> 01:04:21.899
Getting a jump on happy hour?

01:04:21.971 --> 01:04:24.098
No.
I'm waiting for a friend.

01:04:24.173 --> 01:04:25.697
Oh. Me, too.

01:04:27.009 --> 01:04:28.909
Do you mind if I sit here?

01:04:33.048 --> 01:04:35.539
So, I saw you
at the hot dog stand.

01:04:35.651 --> 01:04:37.084
I live in the depot.

01:04:37.152 --> 01:04:38.813
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:04:38.921 --> 01:04:40.445
Oh, cool.

01:04:41.156 --> 01:04:42.783
You're like that old guy
in the movie

01:04:42.858 --> 01:04:44.917
who does the telegraph thing.

01:04:44.994 --> 01:04:46.484
Something like that.

01:04:48.063 --> 01:04:49.462
Oh.

01:04:49.999 --> 01:04:51.466
Hang on.

01:04:52.534 --> 01:04:54.832
Hey, where are you?

01:04:57.006 --> 01:04:59.065
So you couldn't call?

01:05:01.043 --> 01:05:02.135
No, it's fine.

01:05:02.211 --> 01:05:03.872
Don't come.
I... no.

01:05:03.946 --> 01:05:06.380
Just do whatever
you're gonna do.

01:05:07.316 --> 01:05:11.047
No, actually, I met a friend,
and we're having a drink, so...

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.020
I'm gonna go.

01:05:13.989 --> 01:05:15.456
Oh, my God, he's such a prick.

01:05:15.524 --> 01:05:16.821
You want your fries here,
sweetie?

01:05:16.892 --> 01:05:18.951
Yeah, thanks.

01:05:24.333 --> 01:05:26.267
I'm pregnant.

01:05:28.337 --> 01:05:30.999
I haven't told anyone yet.

01:05:31.073 --> 01:05:32.563
Even Chris.

01:05:32.975 --> 01:05:36.536
I was gonna tell him today.
He's probably gonna freak out.

01:05:38.313 --> 01:05:40.304
You don't have to say anything.

01:05:40.382 --> 01:05:42.907
I just wanted to say it.

01:05:46.321 --> 01:05:47.788
Thank you.

01:05:50.826 --> 01:05:54.557
Here.
You can have some of my fries.

01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:57.861
"You say
you're brokenhearted"

01:05:57.933 --> 01:05:58.865
Where's your friend?

01:05:58.934 --> 01:06:01.903
"You can't sleep at night"

01:06:04.306 --> 01:06:06.069
I don't know.

01:06:14.416 --> 01:06:16.316
Can I give you a ride home?

01:06:16.385 --> 01:06:18.148
No, thanks.

01:06:19.588 --> 01:06:20.885
Thanks for hanging out.

01:06:20.956 --> 01:06:22.617
Sure.
Of course.

01:06:29.531 --> 01:06:31.192
Hey, baby.

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:34.068
This your little friend, huh?

01:06:34.136 --> 01:06:36.229
Fuck you, Chris.
I'm leaving.

01:06:36.305 --> 01:06:37.829
Emily.

01:06:37.906 --> 01:06:39.066
Emily, wait.

01:06:39.141 --> 01:06:41.336
- Get off of me!
- Hey.

01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:43.275
Please, don't do that.

01:06:43.345 --> 01:06:45.575
This is none of your business,
all right?

01:06:45.647 --> 01:06:47.706
You want to get out of my way?

01:06:48.517 --> 01:06:50.348
Oh, my God, stop it!
Stop it!

01:06:50.419 --> 01:06:53.183
Fin, go! Go!
Just go!

01:06:54.022 --> 01:06:55.887
What's that guy's problem?

01:06:59.595 --> 01:07:00.619
Fucking freak.

01:07:00.696 --> 01:07:02.391
You're such a fucking prick.

01:07:02.464 --> 01:07:04.762
Emily.
What?

01:07:53.782 --> 01:07:55.010
Hey.

01:07:55.117 --> 01:07:56.584
What's up?

01:07:59.021 --> 01:08:01.387
- I brought you some coffee.
- Thanks.

01:08:02.891 --> 01:08:04.882
Hey, man, I'm sorry
about last night.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:08.452
My pop, you see,
he got a little pain,

01:08:08.530 --> 01:08:10.498
and so I got nervous, you know.

01:08:10.566 --> 01:08:13.399
And I called the doctor.
He's okay, though.

01:08:13.468 --> 01:08:16.095
By the time I called the Mill,
you were gone already.

01:08:16.171 --> 01:08:18.366
You gotta get a phone, bro.

01:08:18.439 --> 01:08:20.874
So, was the Mill fun last night?

01:08:21.210 --> 01:08:22.609
Nope.

01:08:22.678 --> 01:08:24.042
Any word from Olivia?

01:08:24.112 --> 01:08:25.977
- No.
- You wanna do something tonight?

01:08:26.081 --> 01:08:27.548
No.

01:08:28.050 --> 01:08:28.948
What the fuck, man?

01:08:29.051 --> 01:08:31.849
I said I was sorry.
What more do you want from me?

01:08:33.755 --> 01:08:36.349
I want to be left alone, Joe.

01:08:36.425 --> 01:08:38.188
Okay?

01:08:38.794 --> 01:08:40.921
That's what I want.

01:08:44.399 --> 01:08:46.229
Fine.
Be alone.

01:09:48.029 --> 01:09:49.657
Hi, leave a message.

01:09:50.631 --> 01:09:52.657
Pick up the phone.

01:09:52.734 --> 01:09:54.497
Liv?

01:09:54.569 --> 01:09:56.196
You're starting to scare me.

01:09:56.271 --> 01:09:57.670
Olivia?

01:09:57.739 --> 01:10:00.207
Pick up the goddamn phone!

01:10:21.897 --> 01:10:25.094
I was just about to knock.
I'm sorry.

01:10:25.934 --> 01:10:28.266
No. Come in.

01:10:33.275 --> 01:10:35.470
Whoa.

01:10:35.544 --> 01:10:37.978
This place is cool.

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:39.970
Can I...

01:10:41.683 --> 01:10:44.880
Wow. So, are you
gonna fix this up?

01:10:45.487 --> 01:10:47.148
I don't know.

01:10:47.222 --> 01:10:49.315
- I suppose so.
- You should.

01:10:49.391 --> 01:10:50.790
You could make it really nice.

01:10:50.859 --> 01:10:53.123
It's really nice
right now, but...

01:10:54.363 --> 01:10:55.887
Where do you sleep?

01:10:56.865 --> 01:10:57.923
Couch.

01:10:57.999 --> 01:10:59.694
Oh.

01:11:02.237 --> 01:11:05.229
So, I just wanted to come by
and say I'm sorry.

01:11:05.307 --> 01:11:07.832
Chris can be such an asshole
when he gets angry,

01:11:07.909 --> 01:11:09.274
but he's really not a bad guy.

01:11:09.344 --> 01:11:10.811
It's just...

01:11:13.648 --> 01:11:16.116
God, it's so nice
and quiet in here.

01:11:16.218 --> 01:11:19.278
Everybody's freaking out at my
house about me being pregnant.

01:11:19.388 --> 01:11:21.117
I live at home.

01:11:22.257 --> 01:11:25.317
I was gonna move in
with Chris, but...

01:11:30.165 --> 01:11:32.633
So, did the conductor guy
used to live here?

01:11:32.701 --> 01:11:35.898
No. The conductor
worked on the train.

01:11:35.971 --> 01:11:39.270
The station agent
worked in here.

01:11:40.842 --> 01:11:42.104
Doing what?

01:11:42.177 --> 01:11:44.168
A lot of things.

01:11:44.513 --> 01:11:46.242
The train brought in the mail.

01:11:46.348 --> 01:11:49.112
And the agent delivered it.

01:11:49.217 --> 01:11:50.775
They sold groceries.

01:11:50.886 --> 01:11:52.615
They cut hair.

01:11:52.687 --> 01:11:53.984
Really?

01:11:54.055 --> 01:11:55.420
Yeah.

01:11:56.224 --> 01:11:58.317
Are you gonna open a salon?

01:11:58.393 --> 01:12:00.657
I'm retired, actually.

01:12:00.729 --> 01:12:02.492
Aren't you a little young
to be retired?

01:12:02.564 --> 01:12:05.965
No.
Dwarfs retire early.

01:12:06.034 --> 01:12:07.228
Common fact.

01:12:07.302 --> 01:12:09.827
Yeah, lazy dwarfs.

01:12:34.029 --> 01:12:36.691
Can I stay here tonight?

01:12:37.132 --> 01:12:39.157
Just sleep?

01:13:06.628 --> 01:13:08.323
Hey, Fin.

01:13:13.001 --> 01:13:14.969
Is that your girlfriend?

01:13:16.071 --> 01:13:17.766
No.

01:13:19.774 --> 01:13:21.742
Is that other woman
your girlfriend?

01:13:21.810 --> 01:13:23.641
You mean Olivia?

01:13:23.712 --> 01:13:25.270
Mm-hmm.

01:13:25.347 --> 01:13:26.644
No.

01:13:27.249 --> 01:13:29.410
I liked her.

01:13:30.385 --> 01:13:32.285
Yeah. Me, too.

01:13:32.854 --> 01:13:34.913
When is she coming back?

01:13:36.458 --> 01:13:38.187
I don't know.

01:14:44.225 --> 01:14:45.419
What?!

01:14:45.493 --> 01:14:48.189
There is nothing!
There is nothing!

01:14:48.263 --> 01:14:50.663
You have no right to say that.

01:14:50.732 --> 01:14:53.826
You just show up,
and you tell me this?

01:14:53.902 --> 01:14:57.099
I've known you for 17 years!

01:14:57.172 --> 01:15:00.733
You've known me
17 fucking years,

01:15:00.809 --> 01:15:04.267
and you don't...
you have no clue?

01:15:04.346 --> 01:15:06.211
No, David.
What?

01:15:06.314 --> 01:15:08.009
What would be...

01:15:08.116 --> 01:15:10.949
What could be
more important than this? What?

01:15:11.019 --> 01:15:13.487
How could you do this?

01:15:14.022 --> 01:15:14.989
Just go to hell!

01:15:26.835 --> 01:15:27.699
Olivia.

01:15:27.769 --> 01:15:29.327
Go away.

01:15:30.772 --> 01:15:31.966
Are you okay?

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:36.033
I don't want you here, Fin.
Go away.

01:15:36.111 --> 01:15:37.669
- Please, Olivia, just...
- Look...

01:15:37.746 --> 01:15:40.943
I'm not your fucking girlfriend
or your mother, all right?

01:15:41.049 --> 01:15:42.175
I know that.

01:15:42.283 --> 01:15:43.944
- Are you all right?
- You're not a child!

01:15:44.052 --> 01:15:47.749
Get off the fucking porch,
and leave me alone!

01:16:09.544 --> 01:16:12.513
"Lay me down"

01:16:36.071 --> 01:16:37.060
Two.

01:16:40.175 --> 01:16:41.938
Down it slow.

01:17:34.829 --> 01:17:36.228
Oh!

01:17:39.267 --> 01:17:41.235
Here I am!

01:17:43.571 --> 01:17:45.596
Take a look.

01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:50.535
Take a look!

01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:55.381
"Lay me down..."

01:20:21.362 --> 01:20:23.296
Olivia?

01:20:29.304 --> 01:20:30.896
Olivia?

01:20:43.017 --> 01:20:44.644
Olivia?

01:20:52.393 --> 01:20:54.554
Did you take these?

01:20:56.064 --> 01:20:58.362
He's having another baby.

01:20:58.433 --> 01:21:00.628
Did you take all of these?

01:21:02.503 --> 01:21:03.367
Oh, gosh.

01:21:03.438 --> 01:21:05.372
I gotcha, I gotcha.

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:07.670
Come on.

01:21:07.742 --> 01:21:09.437
Oh, God, Fin.

01:21:15.650 --> 01:21:17.515
I want...

01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:21.181
I want...

01:21:21.556 --> 01:21:23.990
I want Sam back.

01:21:26.928 --> 01:21:29.590
I want him back.

01:21:30.498 --> 01:21:32.489
Oh, God.

01:21:35.136 --> 01:21:37.502
I want him back.

01:23:38.493 --> 01:23:41.223
You can come in now,
Mr. McBride.

01:23:44.165 --> 01:23:46.656
Everyone, I want you
to give Mr. McBride

01:23:46.734 --> 01:23:48.895
your full attention.

01:23:54.775 --> 01:23:58.040
"I am here
to speak about trains.

01:23:58.112 --> 01:24:00.103
The first real train
in this country

01:24:00.181 --> 01:24:02.843
was built by Peter Cooper
in 1829.

01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:05.885
Does anyone know
what it was called?"

01:24:09.257 --> 01:24:11.691
"It was called the Tom Thumb."

01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:16.922
"Since that time,

01:24:16.998 --> 01:24:21.526
trains have helped make
this country what it is today.

01:24:21.602 --> 01:24:22.899
A long time ago,

01:24:22.970 --> 01:24:26.872
most people never left their
towns because travel was hard."

01:24:26.941 --> 01:24:27.965
Uh, yes?

01:24:28.042 --> 01:24:29.566
How tall are you?

01:24:29.644 --> 01:24:31.009
Jacob!

01:24:31.379 --> 01:24:34.246
I'm, uh... I'm four feet
and five inches tall.

01:24:34.348 --> 01:24:36.179
I'm taller than you.

01:24:36.284 --> 01:24:37.876
Jacob, come with me.

01:24:37.985 --> 01:24:38.917
I'm so sorry.

01:24:38.986 --> 01:24:41.181
Be back in a minute.

01:24:41.255 --> 01:24:43.018
Such a jerk.

01:24:49.997 --> 01:24:52.397
What about blimps?

01:24:52.466 --> 01:24:54.093
I think blimps came later.

01:24:54.168 --> 01:24:55.635
When?

01:24:56.237 --> 01:24:57.795
I'm not sure exactly.

01:24:57.872 --> 01:24:59.362
Blimps are cool.

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:01.135
Well, so are trains.

01:25:01.209 --> 01:25:04.235
Yeah, well, they're both cool.

01:25:04.645 --> 01:25:06.545
Trains and blimps.

01:25:17.124 --> 01:25:19.388
Anybody hungry for dessert?

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:20.818
I'm stuffed.

01:25:20.895 --> 01:25:22.556
Yeah. Me, too.

01:25:24.065 --> 01:25:25.327
There's plenty of food.

01:25:25.399 --> 01:25:27.765
We can have it
for lunch tomorrow.

01:25:37.144 --> 01:25:39.544
Hey, when were blimps invented?

01:25:41.983 --> 01:25:43.780
I have no idea.

01:25:43.884 --> 01:25:46.045
Yeah, me neither.

01:25:47.021 --> 01:25:51.014
You can go down to the library
and ask that little hottie.

01:25:51.125 --> 01:25:52.922
She is cute.

01:25:52.994 --> 01:25:55.656
It's the librarian fantasy, man.

01:25:56.264 --> 01:25:58.960
Glasses off, hair down.

01:25:59.033 --> 01:26:01.092
Books flying.

01:26:02.336 --> 01:26:04.429
She doesn't wear glasses.

01:26:04.505 --> 01:26:06.973
Well, buy her some.
It's worth it.
