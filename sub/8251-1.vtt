01:36.714 --> 01:40.514
<i>My name is Daphne Reynolds
and I was born in New York City.</i>

01:41.686 --> 01:45.918
<i>I've lived my whole life with my mom
in a fifth-floor walkup in Chinatown.</i>

01:47.558 --> 01:50.425
<i>It's always been just the two of us,
me and Libby.</i>

01:51.395 --> 01:54.262
<i>But every year on my birthday
I'd make a wish.</i>

01:54.432 --> 01:56.764
Make a wish, baby!

01:59.603 --> 02:01.628
<i>That someone else could be there too.</i>

02:02.306 --> 02:04.604
<i>And every year when he didn't come...</i>

02:04.775 --> 02:07.175
<i>...I'd ask my mom to tell me
the same story.</i>

02:10.413 --> 02:14.407
You never get tired of this one,
do you? Okay.

02:14.585 --> 02:16.382
Once upon a time...

02:16.554 --> 02:20.490
<i>...there was a young,
very cool singer named Libby...</i>

02:20.658 --> 02:24.150
<i>...who one day decided to go out
and see the world.</i>

02:31.368 --> 02:35.998
<i>Little did she know that in the deserts
of Morocco fate was waiting for her...</i>

02:41.612 --> 02:44.137
<i>...and his name was Henry.</i>

02:52.456 --> 02:56.654
<i>They fell madly, passionately,
hopelessly in love...</i>

02:57.361 --> 03:01.559
<i>...and were married
by the chief of a Bedouin tribe.</i>

03:07.538 --> 03:12.134
<i>Henry brought her to England to meet
his family so they could get married for real.</i>

03:14.879 --> 03:17.848
<i>But fate was not so kind this time.</i>

03:18.015 --> 03:21.007
<i>She was definitely not
what they were expecting.</i>

03:25.923 --> 03:28.187
<i>But when Henry's father suddenly died...</i>

03:28.359 --> 03:32.489
<i>...Libby knew there'd be more pressure
on him to lead a certain kind of life...</i>

03:32.663 --> 03:36.030
<i>...because he was now Lord Dashwood...</i>

03:36.200 --> 03:39.033
<i>...and Libby was no one's idea of a lady.</i>

03:39.203 --> 03:42.331
Henry knows all about it.
lf you love him, you will go now.

03:45.042 --> 03:47.567
l think you should see this.

03:49.713 --> 03:52.181
Apparently there's someone else.

03:58.823 --> 04:03.522
<i>So even though it broke her heart,
she knew she had to leave him.</i>

04:08.866 --> 04:12.825
<i>But a few months later, fate
gave her the greatest gift of all:</i>

04:13.003 --> 04:17.099
<i>A beautiful baby girl named Daphne.</i>

04:18.608 --> 04:20.769
Sweet dreams, kiddo.

04:20.945 --> 04:23.505
-Love you.
-Love you.

04:24.415 --> 04:28.249
l can't believe you're 1 5 years old today.

04:37.361 --> 04:39.829
Sweet dreams, Henry.

04:47.972 --> 04:51.203
<i>On my 1 7th birthday,
Mom and I had to work.</i>

04:51.442 --> 04:55.276
<i>But it turned out to be
where my story really began.</i>

04:55.446 --> 04:56.811
You delivering something?

04:56.981 --> 05:00.109
Yeah, about three hours
of watered-down rock and roll...

05:00.284 --> 05:02.115
...and one very late waitress.

05:02.286 --> 05:04.618
Sorry.

05:04.788 --> 05:06.915
Watch your head.

05:07.091 --> 05:08.786
Are you related?

05:09.293 --> 05:12.126
-Can l park it?
-Yeah, over there.

05:24.074 --> 05:28.568
How could he do this to me?
lt's our wedding day! Where is he?

05:28.746 --> 05:33.080
What? l should know?
20 minutes and she's lost him already.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.774
Very funny.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.581
Hey, how you doing?

05:49.500 --> 05:51.695
l'm sorry, can l borrow this? Thanks.

05:55.873 --> 05:57.500
Thanks.

05:59.944 --> 06:02.879
Sorry about this.
Come on, big guy, wakey-wakey.

06:07.985 --> 06:09.213
Help! Ma!

06:12.389 --> 06:14.550
-lt's cold and l can't get it out!
-Shout!

06:15.259 --> 06:16.783
Shout!

06:44.588 --> 06:46.818
-Are you done with this, sir?
-Oh, thanks.

06:46.991 --> 06:48.356
Daphne?

06:48.692 --> 06:51.559
-Noelle!
-What are you doing here?

06:51.729 --> 06:53.754
l'm clearing the chicken cacciatore.

06:53.931 --> 06:56.491
Oh, my God, that is so funny!

06:56.667 --> 07:01.263
Guess what? l'm interning at Jenkins
and Taylor before l go to Duke, pre-law.

07:01.438 --> 07:04.805
-What's up next for you?
-The dessert, a selection of sorbets.

07:04.975 --> 07:09.435
-No, where are you going to college?
-The University of the Undecided.

07:11.048 --> 07:12.948
ls that in Ohio?

07:13.117 --> 07:14.379
Yeah.

07:14.551 --> 07:16.542
Undecided, Ohio.

07:16.720 --> 07:20.952
Well, l guess l better be going.
But say hey to Jenkins. And Taylor.

07:21.125 --> 07:24.026
-But--
-lf everyone would clear the dance floor...

07:24.194 --> 07:27.994
...the bride and her father
would like to share a special dance.

08:49.680 --> 08:54.549
-l know. l saw the look.
-l don't want to talk about it.

08:54.718 --> 08:59.417
Every time we do these weddings, Mom,
l see the father-daughter dances.

08:59.590 --> 09:00.921
l just--

09:01.091 --> 09:05.084
l can't help but think that
l'm never gonna get to do that.

09:05.262 --> 09:09.221
l know you think you're doing the
right thing by keeping me from him--

09:09.833 --> 09:13.428
l was trying to protect you
from getting hurt the same way l was.

09:13.604 --> 09:15.196
You left him, remember?

09:15.372 --> 09:18.364
lt's not like he jumped on a plane
and came after me.

09:18.542 --> 09:22.000
Maybe he would have
if he knew l existed.

09:25.149 --> 09:29.017
-lt's not that simple.
-Why can't you understand, Mom?

09:29.186 --> 09:32.383
l feel like half of me is missing.

09:32.556 --> 09:37.050
And without the other half, how am
l supposed to know who l really am?

09:37.628 --> 09:39.425
Daph.

09:39.596 --> 09:44.932
Getting to know someone because
they share the same DNA isn't the answer.

09:45.536 --> 09:48.437
lt's about getting to know yourself.

09:49.406 --> 09:53.843
Come on, let's go steal some leftovers.
Lasagna looks great.

09:57.981 --> 10:02.179
l love you a million Swedish fish.

10:03.754 --> 10:06.621
l love you a million red M&M's.

10:54.805 --> 10:56.329
Taxi!

10:59.643 --> 11:02.339
-Where to, miss?
-JFK, Virgin Atlantic.

11:02.512 --> 11:03.672
No problem.

11:03.847 --> 11:07.248
<i>Maybe the answer was taking
a year or two off before college...</i>

11:07.417 --> 11:10.409
<i>...to find out what I'm supposed
to do with my life.</i>

11:11.255 --> 11:15.214
<i>But deep down,
I think I've always known...</i>

11:16.260 --> 11:20.594
<i>...what I really need more than anything
else in the world is to find him...</i>

11:20.764 --> 11:22.994
<i>...to find my dad.</i>

11:23.233 --> 11:27.602
<i>Mom, you always said it was up to me
to write the rest of my story...</i>

11:27.771 --> 11:30.604
<i>...but you've been writing it for me,
Mom.</i>

11:31.808 --> 11:34.276
<i>Now it has to be my turn.</i>

11:42.119 --> 11:44.053
-Can l borrow that for a sec?
-Sure.

12:28.265 --> 12:31.564
Great Britain Grand Hotel?

12:31.735 --> 12:33.293
What?

13:01.565 --> 13:03.760
-That's not it.
-lt sounded really good.

13:03.934 --> 13:06.061
-Thanks.
-ls that a Gibson J200?

13:06.236 --> 13:08.227
Yeah.

13:08.405 --> 13:12.603
-Are you a musician?
-No, but l live with one back home.

13:14.678 --> 13:16.509
My mom.

13:17.447 --> 13:20.280
So you checking in?

13:21.251 --> 13:23.412
-Day job?
-Yeah. One of many.

13:23.587 --> 13:26.385
You know, life of a struggling musician.

13:26.556 --> 13:28.319
Hey, lan, catch!

13:30.494 --> 13:33.122
Come on, l'll show you around.

13:35.332 --> 13:38.028
So the kitchen's through there.

13:38.201 --> 13:40.135
Common room's down the hall.

13:40.303 --> 13:44.501
l should warn you, the dog and bone's
on the blink and we've no lift here.

13:45.175 --> 13:47.075
Phone is broken.

13:47.244 --> 13:49.940
Elevator, none.

13:50.113 --> 13:52.081
Loo's free.

13:53.450 --> 13:54.940
Who's Lou?

13:55.118 --> 13:57.518
We better take this slowly.

13:58.722 --> 14:00.747
<i>Lord Henry Dashwood announced today...</i>

14:00.924 --> 14:04.257
<i>...he was giving up his hereditary seat
in the House of Lords...</i>

14:04.428 --> 14:06.555
<i>...to run for election as a commoner.</i>

14:06.730 --> 14:10.791
<i>Why should an accident of birth give me
the right to make decisions for people?</i>

14:10.967 --> 14:12.992
<i>-The only power I want...
-My dad!</i>

14:13.170 --> 14:17.903
<i>...is the power the voters choose to give
me. That's why I'm standing in this election.</i>

14:18.074 --> 14:19.234
<i>Thank you.</i>

14:19.409 --> 14:24.176
<i>Lord Dashwood, who will marry his fiancée
Glynnis Payne this summer...</i>

14:24.381 --> 14:28.147
<i>...will also inherit a stepdaughter,
the lovely Clarissa Payne.</i>

14:28.318 --> 14:33.381
<i>But this surprising announcement has sent
shock waves through Westminster.</i>

14:33.557 --> 14:36.788
<i>He now appears to be
an unstoppable political force.</i>

14:36.960 --> 14:41.260
l admit, when you first suggested
giving up your seat in the House of Lords...

14:41.431 --> 14:47.233
...l began to question your sanity.
But, no, this is political dynamite.

14:47.404 --> 14:50.931
l had an eccentric idea we might
actually be doing the right thing.

14:51.107 --> 14:54.133
lt's possible to do the right thing
and still be a winner.

14:54.311 --> 14:58.577
The latest poll puts the party six points
ahead. That's all due to you, Henry.

14:58.748 --> 15:02.616
You're transforming the image
of the party your father loved.

15:02.786 --> 15:07.780
He would have been so proud of you.
You're young, thrusting, idealistic...

15:07.958 --> 15:09.550
...an impeccable reputation....

15:09.726 --> 15:13.457
And a fabulous fiancée
with all the right connections.

15:13.630 --> 15:18.397
Sorry to interrupt, but if l don't steal him
he'll miss his speech at the Oxfam ball.

15:18.568 --> 15:21.560
-Oh, blast it, my speech.
-Right-hand pocket, darling.

15:25.108 --> 15:26.598
She thinks of everything.

15:27.043 --> 15:30.479
Well, gentlemen, that seems to be all.
Thank you.

15:30.647 --> 15:32.877
You two enjoy yourselves.

15:34.050 --> 15:35.278
How's our boy doing?

15:35.452 --> 15:40.890
lf he doesn't ruffle too many feathers,
he'll be the next prime minister.

15:41.057 --> 15:42.649
Excellent.

15:48.064 --> 15:51.090
lan, l don't know if l can do this anymore.

15:51.268 --> 15:52.735
Daphne, he's your father.

15:52.903 --> 15:57.067
You've flown halfway around the world
to see him. You can't turn back now.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.504
He's got a family now, l mean....

15:59.676 --> 16:03.703
You saw them, they're so elegant
and sophisticated. lt's like....

16:04.614 --> 16:06.309
What would he want with me?

16:06.483 --> 16:09.919
-Yeah, well, you got a point there.
-Shut up.

16:10.487 --> 16:13.945
lt's just not as simple as l thought.

16:15.091 --> 16:19.425
Maybe l should just go home
and let him get on with his life.

16:50.460 --> 16:52.257
Can l help you, miss?

16:57.334 --> 16:59.393
Actually, no.

17:00.070 --> 17:01.469
Thanks.

17:34.938 --> 17:40.171
<i>Perfect. Absolutely wonderful.
Thank you so much. Ciao.</i>

17:42.312 --> 17:45.281
You haven't forgotten Lady Wrightwood's
this afternoon, have you?

17:45.448 --> 17:49.544
She is sponsoring us for the Royal Enclosure
at Ascot. We have to be there.

17:49.753 --> 17:52.722
l thought marrying Henry
meant we didn't have to try so hard.

17:52.889 --> 17:54.982
l'm not getting married for five weeks.

17:55.158 --> 17:57.319
Until then we have
to keep up appearances.

17:57.494 --> 18:00.691
Look what happened to Olivia Dixon
when she went to China.

18:00.864 --> 18:03.890
-Who's Olivia Dixon?
-Exactly.

18:18.181 --> 18:20.046
-Did you see that?
-What?

18:20.216 --> 18:23.379
An impossibly large bird
falling off that wall.

18:25.055 --> 18:27.080
Are you hallucinating?

18:49.179 --> 18:50.976
These eggs are positively glacial.

18:51.147 --> 18:54.742
When l run this house, senile servants
will be the first thing to go.

18:54.918 --> 18:58.149
You'd have to get around the old bat.
She'd never allow it.

18:58.321 --> 19:01.256
Anyone seen my pruning shears?

19:01.424 --> 19:04.791
The old bat seems to have forgotten
where she put them.

19:09.999 --> 19:12.968
Morning. Morning, Mother.
Morning, darling.

19:13.670 --> 19:15.638
Everyone sleep well?

19:16.773 --> 19:18.138
Apparently not.

19:18.975 --> 19:21.500
There's someone at the window.
l'm not hallucinating.

19:21.678 --> 19:23.475
lt's those bloody paparazzi again.

19:23.646 --> 19:26.979
Percy, call the police.
l will not tolerate this media circus!

19:36.826 --> 19:39.090
-Where do you think you're going?
-lt's you!

19:39.262 --> 19:42.322
How long do you people have to spy
before realizing there's no story?

19:42.499 --> 19:45.400
-You've got the wrong idea.
-Tell it to the authorities.

19:45.568 --> 19:49.163
The real scandal is how young
they're starting you guttersnipes now.

19:49.339 --> 19:54.572
<i>You sit down and tell me who sent you.
The Sun? The Daily Star?</i>

19:57.247 --> 20:00.512
Good heavens, you can't be
more than 1 7.

20:02.285 --> 20:04.480
Go on, take your picture and go away.

20:04.654 --> 20:07.316
-l already have a picture of you.
-What's going on?

20:13.730 --> 20:16.426
-Where the devil did you get this?
-From Libby.

20:17.300 --> 20:20.827
-That singer you met on a camel?
-Why would Libby give this to you?

20:21.004 --> 20:24.371
She thought l'd want to know
what my father looked like.

20:24.541 --> 20:28.272
My name is Daphne Reynolds.
l'm Libby's daughter.

20:30.780 --> 20:33.340
According to this...

20:33.650 --> 20:35.675
...l'm your daughter too.

20:37.554 --> 20:39.078
Oh, for heaven's sake!

20:39.255 --> 20:43.157
Seems you had an even better time
in Morocco than you let on.

20:43.393 --> 20:45.759
Oh, dear God.

20:46.930 --> 20:48.659
l haven't--

21:05.014 --> 21:07.346
No, this is impossible.

21:07.517 --> 21:09.951
-Must be a mistake.
-Exactly, a mistake.

21:10.119 --> 21:11.780
This doesn't prove anything.

21:11.955 --> 21:15.721
This Libby must have written down
the first man she could think of.

21:16.292 --> 21:19.819
You're the only man she's ever thought of.

21:21.030 --> 21:25.091
Can l have a word with you in private
for a moment, please?

21:25.268 --> 21:27.202
Henry?

21:27.370 --> 21:30.430
You're not going to believe her, are you?

21:31.908 --> 21:33.933
Maybe l....

21:34.110 --> 21:37.341
Maybe l shouldn't have come.
This is a big shock for you.

21:37.513 --> 21:40.448
l'm freaking out
and l've known since l was 2.

21:40.617 --> 21:45.486
Don't get me wrong, l mean in a good way.
l've dreamt about this my whole life.

21:46.289 --> 21:50.248
Not that exact entrance, of course.
l imagined something more graceful.

21:52.662 --> 21:55.358
l can see now
that it was probably a mistake.

21:58.067 --> 22:00.331
l shouldn't have come.

22:04.007 --> 22:08.103
Sorry, did you just say you've known
about this your whole life?

22:08.878 --> 22:12.541
-Yeah.
-Good. Now we've got that settled...

22:12.715 --> 22:14.979
...how about some tea
and a piece of fruitcake?

22:15.151 --> 22:17.881
Your mother didn't feel l deserved
the same consideration?

22:18.054 --> 22:21.023
-No to the fruitcake, then.
-How could she keep this from me?!

22:21.190 --> 22:26.093
What happened to the mistake theory
we were operating on a moment ago?

22:26.829 --> 22:29.423
No, wait a minute, ducky.

22:29.832 --> 22:33.962
Henry, l know this has come as a shock,
but we can't just let the girl go.

22:34.137 --> 22:38.233
-Not until we've got to the bottom of this.
-Shall l call a hotel, madam?

22:38.408 --> 22:40.342
And tell them what, exactly?

22:40.510 --> 22:45.914
The best-known candidate in a generation
is requesting a room for a teenage girl?

22:46.082 --> 22:49.745
-The press will have a field day.
-Can we leave the press out of this?

22:49.919 --> 22:54.083
-No, Glynnis is absolutely right.
-Thank God someone else is thinking straight.

22:54.257 --> 22:57.055
The girl must stay here, with us.

23:00.763 --> 23:05.791
Darling, before we let this hypothetical
daughter blow your political career...

23:05.969 --> 23:09.029
-...we might consider checking up on her.
-For what?

23:09.205 --> 23:12.072
Criminal record? Blood type?
Triple sixes on her scalp?

23:12.241 --> 23:18.043
Glynnis, she has a birth certificate,
she has my photograph and she has my eyes.

23:18.848 --> 23:20.645
Only thinking of what's best for you.

23:20.817 --> 23:24.412
l know you don't like thinking about it,
but the press can be brutal.

23:24.587 --> 23:27.715
''Exclusive! Henry Dashwood
in Love Child Shocker!''

23:27.890 --> 23:31.849
Actually, she's not strictly a love child.
Her mother and l were married.

23:32.028 --> 23:36.795
l mean, not technically.
lt was a Bedouin ceremony in Morocco.

23:36.966 --> 23:39.594
We planned to make it official
as soon as we got back...

23:39.769 --> 23:42.397
...but for some reason Libby decided to....

23:42.572 --> 23:44.267
Well, anyway, she left.

23:44.440 --> 23:47.603
-Taking something of yours with her.
-Put a cork in it.

23:47.777 --> 23:51.736
Maybe someone should have put
a cork in it 1 7 years ago!

23:54.417 --> 23:56.078
Well, here we are.

24:14.203 --> 24:16.228
Will it do?

24:16.406 --> 24:21.241
Are you kidding? lt's incredible!
lt's bigger than our entire apartment...

24:21.411 --> 24:26.678
...and the restaurant downstairs. lt makes
the White House look like a McDonald's.

24:26.849 --> 24:30.410
l get the point. Now, why don't
l send Percy to fetch your things?

24:30.586 --> 24:34.147
-Thank you so much, Lady Dashwood.
-No hugs, dear.

24:34.323 --> 24:38.692
l'm British. We only show affection
to dogs and horses.

24:39.662 --> 24:41.152
Right.

24:42.865 --> 24:44.833
You rock!

25:03.653 --> 25:05.382
Hello?

25:07.256 --> 25:08.689
<i>-Libby?
-Henry.</i>

25:08.858 --> 25:12.294
-ls she there? ls she all right?
-Yeah, she's here.

25:13.129 --> 25:16.394
She's fine. Mother is force-feeding her
fruitcake as we speak.

25:19.001 --> 25:21.492
How could you not tell me
l'd fathered a child?

25:21.671 --> 25:24.731
You let her show up
1 7 years later, unannounced--

25:24.907 --> 25:27.842
And what?
Put a dent in your political career?

25:28.010 --> 25:31.275
-No, that's not--
-lf you're afraid of a scandal, send her back.

25:31.447 --> 25:35.679
lt's not about scandal, it's finding out
l had a daughter for half my life!

25:46.863 --> 25:48.228
Libby.

25:50.433 --> 25:52.230
l didn't want her to get hurt.

25:52.401 --> 25:55.336
<i>-What is that supposed to mean?
-Ask your advisors.</i>

25:55.505 --> 25:58.804
They've gotten you this far, haven't they?

26:14.924 --> 26:20.988
My point is that Henry's strength has
been that he's completely scandal-free...

26:21.164 --> 26:24.725
...unlike his opponent.
This could ruin everything.

26:24.901 --> 26:27.597
Have you finished stating the obvious?

26:27.770 --> 26:30.864
Good. Then let me explain
what we're going to do.

26:31.040 --> 26:35.067
We give the papers the story,
but we spin it our way.

26:35.244 --> 26:37.235
Let's see what we have.

26:37.413 --> 26:39.574
Yes, the Royal Dress Show.

26:40.183 --> 26:44.620
lntroduce her as the daughter you've always
known, but rarely were able to be with.

26:44.787 --> 26:47.813
The press still gets a story,
but it's cut off at the knees.

26:47.990 --> 26:51.517
We are dealing with a living,
breathing 1 7-year-old girl.

26:51.694 --> 26:55.596
The only thing we know is
that she's an American teenager.

26:55.765 --> 26:57.460
Hardly a promising start.

26:57.633 --> 27:01.763
Still, what do you think, Henry?
Liability or asset?

27:02.438 --> 27:05.305
Well, l've only spent a few moments
with her myself...

27:05.508 --> 27:08.602
...but my sense is that
she's quite mature for her age.

27:13.449 --> 27:14.939
She seems well-mannered.

27:17.019 --> 27:19.510
-Thanks, Percy!
-Your lunch, Miss Daphne.

27:19.689 --> 27:23.250
l'd say rather self-contained, soft-spoken.

27:35.571 --> 27:37.937
Perfect. Let's run with it.

27:40.676 --> 27:43.440
Ah, me. Please be Armistead.

27:45.881 --> 27:50.375
-Dashwood residence, Clarissa speaking.
-This is lan Wallace. ls Daphne there?

27:50.553 --> 27:52.680
She's not here.

27:52.855 --> 27:56.291
There's no one here by that name, actually.
Sorry.

27:58.394 --> 28:03.229
lf you do happen to see her, could you
tell her lan Wallace is trying to find her?

28:03.399 --> 28:05.697
Absolutely. l will.

28:07.637 --> 28:08.626
Not.

28:32.261 --> 28:35.458
-Daphne.
-Mr. Dashwood.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.565
-Lord Dashwood?
-Call me Henry.

28:37.733 --> 28:39.564
Henry. Okay.

28:40.703 --> 28:44.332
-This is a cool room.
-Listen, l....

28:45.141 --> 28:47.302
l was just wondering if....

28:49.278 --> 28:53.772
l was wondering if.... Well, l don't know
if this would interest you, actually...

28:55.251 --> 28:59.347
...but l was hoping you might accompany
me to the Royal Dress Show on Friday?

29:00.022 --> 29:03.355
-Dress show?
-Yes, it's ass-numbingly dull.

29:04.527 --> 29:07.792
Some people l have to impress
take it frightfully seriously.

29:07.963 --> 29:09.760
ls it like a fashion show?

29:09.932 --> 29:13.959
Gwyneth and Madonna go to those things,
right? Do you think they'd be there?

29:14.136 --> 29:18.505
l have no idea what you're talking about,
but for me it's a stop on the campaign trail.

29:18.674 --> 29:21.575
For Glynnis, it's a chance
to launch Clarissa on society.

29:21.744 --> 29:24.042
Launch? You make her sound like a ship.

29:24.213 --> 29:28.877
No, in Clarissa's case it's more like
an intercontinental ballistic missile.

29:29.518 --> 29:33.045
She's what in the old days
might have been called a debutante.

29:35.324 --> 29:37.792
Well, l don't know. l just....

29:39.628 --> 29:44.292
-Could you bear it?
-Could l bear it? l mean that'd be....

29:45.401 --> 29:47.733
-That'd be cool.
-Really?

29:47.903 --> 29:50.736
Well, good. That's settled, then.
That's good.

29:55.945 --> 29:57.708
Good.

30:00.716 --> 30:05.949
l forgot. l brought this for you.
lt's some pictures of me growing up.

30:06.422 --> 30:09.118
-That's....
-l thought you might want to have it.

30:09.291 --> 30:11.486
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

30:11.660 --> 30:15.460
That's splendid, thank you.

30:16.999 --> 30:18.933
Okay.

31:09.084 --> 31:12.645
Daphne, could l get your advice
on something?

31:12.822 --> 31:13.811
Sure.

31:13.989 --> 31:16.924
l can't decide which one to wear
to the show tomorrow...

31:17.092 --> 31:21.859
-...and l was wondering what you thought.
-ls that a Gucci tartan mini? That's so cute!

31:22.031 --> 31:26.661
-You can go that funky to the show?
-Daphne, that's the whole point.

31:26.836 --> 31:28.997
Turn up in a sensible dress and pearls...

31:29.171 --> 31:32.436
...and you might as well wear
a sign saying, ''Spot the Plonker.''

31:34.043 --> 31:36.443
l'm glad you told me.
Wouldn't want to be a plonker.

31:36.612 --> 31:38.773
What are stepsisters for?

31:44.553 --> 31:47.249
-This is really cute.
-Good. l'll wear that, then.

31:48.924 --> 31:51.518
-See you later!
-Bye!

32:00.669 --> 32:02.432
l'm here to see Daphne Reynolds.

32:02.605 --> 32:05.768
-Do you have an appointment?
-No, but she's a friend of mine.

32:05.941 --> 32:09.604
-You don't get in without an appointment.
-She'll want to see me.

32:09.778 --> 32:12.713
-Could you move away now, please, sir?
-What?

32:12.882 --> 32:16.215
-Could you move away now, please?
-All right, chill out, mate.

32:16.385 --> 32:18.751
You don't own the place.

32:37.806 --> 32:39.569
No, stop!

32:53.055 --> 32:55.023
No. Not good.

32:57.026 --> 33:00.689
l'm so sorry. One second.
l'll be right there. Almost ready.

33:01.664 --> 33:02.926
One second!

33:03.098 --> 33:07.091
We have to go! Prince Charles,
Harry and Wills will already be there.

33:07.269 --> 33:09.931
Why doesn't Daphne come along later?

33:12.374 --> 33:15.502
-l suppose Percy could drive--
-Brilliant. lt's settled, then.

33:20.583 --> 33:22.448
Come on!

33:26.322 --> 33:28.517
Well, isn't this perfect?

33:43.939 --> 33:46.737
-Go low on that one, Army.
-Low? Low it is.

33:48.577 --> 33:53.640
You'd think they'd choose debs who actually
had ankles. Those look like baked hams.

33:55.718 --> 33:58.118
-Shall l park the car?
-No, see you later!

33:58.287 --> 34:01.017
Sorry. No admittance.
Show's already started.

34:01.190 --> 34:02.384
Come on!

34:05.394 --> 34:06.383
Cow!

34:13.435 --> 34:15.733
Where is this Daphne, anyway?

34:15.904 --> 34:18.804
She'll probably swing through
on a vine any minute.

34:18.974 --> 34:21.568
The girl is positively barbaric.

34:21.744 --> 34:25.475
l hope she doesn't embarrass me
in front of Armistead.

34:33.255 --> 34:35.985
We still have the arrival
of Henry's illegitimate daughter.

34:36.158 --> 34:41.186
You needn't worry. Henry assured me
she will be the soul of discretion.

34:44.800 --> 34:47.291
-ls this the way to the show?
-Go! You're on!

34:50.706 --> 34:52.400
Oh, my giddy aunt!

35:01.016 --> 35:03.109
Holy poo on toast!

35:07.489 --> 35:08.956
Henry...

35:09.491 --> 35:10.856
...do something!

35:15.631 --> 35:17.531
That's her.

35:27.076 --> 35:28.907
Who is that adorable creature?

35:30.279 --> 35:32.941
She can dump tea in my harbor anytime.

35:41.790 --> 35:43.280
Thank you, London!

35:48.597 --> 35:51.998
l say, are you all right?
Are you sure?

35:53.869 --> 35:56.929
-What a disgrace!
-Must be American.

35:58.207 --> 36:01.608
Make way, everyone.
Tacky American coming through.

36:01.877 --> 36:05.210
<i>My evil stepsister.
You've seen Cinderella, right?</i>

36:05.948 --> 36:08.849
Let me clue you in. l win.

36:12.688 --> 36:15.418
-What a cute dog!
-l beg your pardon?

36:15.591 --> 36:17.991
l'm Henry Dashwood's daughter
from New York.

36:18.160 --> 36:21.391
-l didn't know Henry had a daughter.
-Can l play with him?

36:22.498 --> 36:26.298
-She's very temperamental! A biter!
-Seems sweet.

36:27.669 --> 36:31.799
-Hey, guy! l like the ribbon.
-Oh, dear. Excuse me, won't you?

36:31.974 --> 36:33.635
Cute little guy, let's play.

36:33.809 --> 36:37.142
-Princess Charlotte, l do apologize.
-lt's all right, Henry.

36:37.312 --> 36:43.012
l've just been having a delicious moment
with your daughter.

36:43.185 --> 36:48.487
Wonderful girl. A little rough around
the edges, but you'll sort those out.

36:48.657 --> 36:52.753
-ls she staying for the summer?
-No, no, no.

36:52.928 --> 36:55.795
-Oh, l'm afraid not.
-No, no, no.

36:56.398 --> 36:57.387
-No.
-Yes.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.764
My daughter will be
joining us this season.

37:00.936 --> 37:03.200
-What season?
-Oh, my dear, you'll love it!

37:03.372 --> 37:07.399
Beautiful gowns, lovely tiaras,
long, silky gloves...

37:07.576 --> 37:11.603
...and the feverish kissing
in the cloakroom.

37:11.780 --> 37:14.214
l must have my little baby back.

37:14.383 --> 37:17.580
Come here, my darling. There.

37:19.788 --> 37:21.278
There now, sweetheart.

37:21.456 --> 37:23.651
-You've found a new friend.
-Come on, Daphne.

37:23.826 --> 37:26.522
-Who's my precious girl?
-Let's get you out of here.

37:26.695 --> 37:30.290
-Daddy.
-Relax, darling, relax.

37:30.465 --> 37:33.901
She'll be gone in no time,
just like her mother.

37:46.648 --> 37:48.309
Jesus!

37:49.284 --> 37:51.775
-You scared the bejesus out of me.
-Sorry.

37:51.954 --> 37:54.218
So you're the milk thief.

37:56.491 --> 38:00.325
-What're you doing up so late?
-Jet lag.

38:00.729 --> 38:02.856
What's your excuse?

38:03.031 --> 38:06.432
Couldn't sleep. Just thinking.

38:06.602 --> 38:09.070
How l nearly wiped out
the entire royal family?

38:09.771 --> 38:14.538
l think they enjoyed it. lt's the first time
Princess Charlotte's taken a shine to anyone.

38:14.710 --> 38:19.044
And no one will go near that dog since
it ate one of Lord Barret's testicles.

38:19.214 --> 38:23.617
-Tragic.
-The real tragedy is, he's still reproducing.

38:25.821 --> 38:30.622
Coco Pops. lnteresting choice.

38:30.792 --> 38:35.092
-l had you down as an All-Bran man.
-These are strictly contraband.

38:35.264 --> 38:38.392
Glynnis makes me eat that
other gravel every morning.

38:39.801 --> 38:44.829
-Do you like Coco Pops?
-Dude, it's chocolate. Need l say more?

38:54.116 --> 38:57.210
Did you mean what you said
about me staying for the summer?

38:57.386 --> 38:59.513
Yes. Yes, l did.

39:00.188 --> 39:02.918
So does that mean l'm gonna
be launched on society?

39:03.091 --> 39:07.027
l suppose we ought to arrange
some sort of coming-out party for you.

39:07.195 --> 39:10.926
Coming-out party? Coming out as what?

39:12.434 --> 39:15.870
-As a young woman.
-What are you trying to say, Henry?

39:16.038 --> 39:20.372
l just-- l mean as a young woman
of a certain...

39:20.542 --> 39:24.103
...social standing and eligibility.

39:24.279 --> 39:26.213
Eligibility? For what?

39:26.381 --> 39:32.149
Well, for men--
l mean, for male suitors to....

39:35.857 --> 39:40.419
-l'm not explaining this very well, am l?
-No. But l'm having fun watching you try.

39:40.595 --> 39:45.123
Yes, well, perhaps we ought to leave
the party arrangements to you.

39:46.401 --> 39:49.666
lt's not my kind of thing,
but l'll think about it.

39:51.139 --> 39:52.697
Thanks, Henry.

39:56.511 --> 40:02.006
l was just wondering
whether your mother ever...?

40:05.354 --> 40:10.815
-No. No, she never got married.
-No, but obviously there'd be....

40:10.993 --> 40:13.723
There'd be somebody, you know....

40:25.540 --> 40:28.008
Well, off to bed, l suppose.

40:32.748 --> 40:37.412
l hope you find your sleeping arrangements
conducive to a good night's--

40:37.586 --> 40:41.249
Henry? ''Sweet dreams'' is all it takes.

40:41.490 --> 40:42.957
Right.

40:44.860 --> 40:46.794
Well, sweet dreams.

40:51.700 --> 40:53.861
Sweet dreams, Henry.

40:59.708 --> 41:02.108
Morning, Henry!

41:03.478 --> 41:06.572
-Off to work?
-l was just-- Well, yes.

41:07.115 --> 41:10.812
Oh, that reminds me. We must
get a dress for you for Saturday.

41:10.986 --> 41:13.546
-What's on Saturday?
-The ball at the Orwoods' .

41:13.722 --> 41:17.783
-Lots of hands to shake, l'm afraid.
-l can help Daphne find a dress.

41:18.827 --> 41:24.288
We know that wouldn't be a good idea.
No, l found a gown at my designer's.

41:24.733 --> 41:27.964
l've put it in your room, dear.
lt's utterly ravishing.

41:28.136 --> 41:32.937
Excellent. Thank you. l'm counting on
you girls to give Daphne some pointers.

41:33.108 --> 41:34.769
Bye, now.

41:45.921 --> 41:48.719
Oh, very you. Lovely.

41:49.191 --> 41:50.715
Thanks.

41:50.892 --> 41:54.191
So Henry asked us to give you
some pointers, didn't he?

41:54.362 --> 41:57.627
Well, pointer number one, go home.

41:57.933 --> 42:01.926
Mother and l belong here and it's
quite clear you just don't fit in.

42:02.104 --> 42:04.334
And pointer two?
While you're packing...

42:04.506 --> 42:09.443
...keep your grimy little Yankee paws
off Armistead Stuart.

42:09.611 --> 42:12.512
-He's mine.
-lf you'd take your nose out of the air...

42:12.681 --> 42:15.548
...you'd see you're designer,
l'm vintage.

42:15.717 --> 42:18.242
You've got a mansion,
l have a five-floor walkup.

42:18.420 --> 42:21.685
You're snotty Little Miss Cranky Pants
and l go with the flow.

42:21.857 --> 42:25.884
So why would you ever think
that l'd ever have the same taste in guys?

42:26.061 --> 42:29.963
So here's a little pointer for you.
Get over yourself.

42:30.132 --> 42:35.035
And stop trying to be my daddy's
little girl, because l'm not going anywhere.

42:39.474 --> 42:40.736
Bye.

42:46.848 --> 42:48.440
Pull!

42:51.753 --> 42:56.417
Don't listen to that silly twit Clarissa.
She's just threatened by you, that's all.

42:56.591 --> 42:57.853
Pull!

43:01.963 --> 43:05.592
-Why would she be threatened?
-Her mother is about to marry my son...

43:05.767 --> 43:07.997
...and gain a title
and all that goes with it.

43:08.170 --> 43:13.039
For years, Alistair tried to elevate his
position through my husband's career.

43:13.208 --> 43:15.642
Now he's got his claws into Henry.

43:15.810 --> 43:19.541
People like Alistair and Glynnis,
social standing is everything.

43:19.714 --> 43:20.976
Pull!

43:24.252 --> 43:28.780
lt's silly, but they live by it.
And l lived by it too, once.

43:29.324 --> 43:33.556
Till l saw what a toll it took
on the people who l love most.

43:33.828 --> 43:37.320
Believe me, there'll be plenty
of people rooting for you to fail.

43:37.933 --> 43:40.595
That's what makes it such fun.

43:41.670 --> 43:43.661
-Bring it on.
-Pull!

43:45.740 --> 43:48.470
Oh, dear. ls that how
the West was won?

44:13.268 --> 44:17.932
Lord Henry Dashwood. Miss Glynnis
Payne. Miss Clarissa Payne.

44:18.873 --> 44:21.501
Mr. and Mrs. Edward Ashley.

44:21.676 --> 44:25.112
-Thank you very, very much.
-Thank you.

44:25.280 --> 44:27.339
-Thanks.
-Who's next?

44:30.418 --> 44:34.013
Lord and Lady Harrison Gordon.

44:34.356 --> 44:37.883
Lord and Lady Jeffrey Charles.

44:39.761 --> 44:44.221
Now, come along, Daphne. Deep breath
and remember the family motto.

44:44.399 --> 44:46.492
What's the family motto?

44:47.302 --> 44:49.736
-What does that mean?
-lt means, ducky...

44:49.904 --> 44:53.203
...hang in there and you'll rock!

44:53.375 --> 44:55.969
Lady Jocelyn Dashwood,
Countess of Wycombe.

44:56.144 --> 45:00.171
Lady Jocelyn Dashwood,
Countess of Wycombe.

45:03.885 --> 45:05.580
Miss Daphne Reynolds.

45:05.754 --> 45:11.215
41 3 Mulberry Street,
Chinatown, New York.

45:19.501 --> 45:22.231
-What has she done to that dress?
-Mother!

45:27.108 --> 45:30.077
-Fantastic!
-Who designed the dress, Miss Reynolds?

45:30.245 --> 45:32.372
Could you hold it on that step, please?

45:35.550 --> 45:37.814
-Let's go.
-That wretched girl!

45:37.986 --> 45:40.546
-Yummy.
-Can you look this side, please?

45:40.722 --> 45:43.190
-That's right.
-Can l have another smile?

45:43.658 --> 45:46.422
That's beautiful, Miss Reynolds.
This way. Lovely.

45:46.594 --> 45:49.154
-Can we get a photograph?
-Excuse me, thank you.

45:49.331 --> 45:52.664
Thank you. That will be all, gentlemen.
Thank you very much.

45:52.834 --> 45:57.271
l'm sorry about that. You're still
something of a novelty, l'm afraid.

45:57.572 --> 46:01.303
-Are those the girls that are coming out?
-Yes, Peach and Pear Orwood.

46:01.476 --> 46:05.207
-The daughters of Lord Orwood.
-Have you noticed the chandelier?

46:05.380 --> 46:08.281
Chairman of my constituency party.

46:08.450 --> 46:11.180
The real love of his life
is that chandelier.

46:11.353 --> 46:13.617
Don't let him catch you looking at it.

46:13.788 --> 46:16.313
You'll start his boring story
about how Napoleon...

46:16.491 --> 46:19.221
...gave it to Josephine
at the Battle of Borodino.

46:19.394 --> 46:21.328
The story is longer than the battle.

46:21.496 --> 46:25.489
Excuse me. l wonder if l might request
a dance from your gorgeous daughter?

46:25.667 --> 46:28.898
l'm sure she'd be delighted.
Thank you, Armistead.

46:33.675 --> 46:37.406
l can't believe that little imposter
is going to ruin my summer.

46:37.579 --> 46:41.174
She may be a lot of things, but
l can't believe imposter is one.

46:41.349 --> 46:43.817
Technically, she's 39th
in line to the throne.

46:43.985 --> 46:49.252
Really, Fiona, 38 people would have
to die for her to be queen.

46:49.424 --> 46:53.451
Well, it's far less than
the 72 you'd need.

46:53.762 --> 46:59.291
Women are just drawn to me.
lt's something l happen to be blessed with.

46:59.467 --> 47:05.463
An indefinable quality that just
relaxes them, fascinates them.

47:05.640 --> 47:08.541
-You're feeling it, aren't you, Dabney?
-lt's Daphne.

47:09.110 --> 47:12.011
And let me guess, you're feeling it
in my backside?

47:18.720 --> 47:20.085
lan.

48:27.222 --> 48:31.522
Ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna take
a short break. See you in 1 0.

48:33.862 --> 48:36.797
Warning: colonial strumpet alert.

48:37.198 --> 48:39.860
Hi, l'm Daphne Reynolds.
Peach and Pear, isn't it?

48:40.034 --> 48:42.559
-Are those your real names?
-Yes.

48:42.737 --> 48:46.537
Pumpkin and Gourd would have
been much more appropriate.

48:46.708 --> 48:49.643
-Our mother was obsessed with fruit.
-And vegetables.

48:49.811 --> 48:54.043
-We have a sister called Parsnip.
-She doesn't get out much.

48:54.215 --> 48:57.946
Let's bail. This party's a total bore.

48:58.386 --> 49:01.913
Don't listen to her, the party's hopping!

49:05.793 --> 49:07.488
Excuse me for a second?

49:09.297 --> 49:11.424
She is so nice.

49:16.671 --> 49:20.232
-Henry, old chap.
-What a wonderful evening.

49:20.408 --> 49:24.777
l'm glad you're enjoying yourself. l don't
know if you've noticed the chandelier.

49:25.213 --> 49:27.443
Actually, it's a rather fascinating story.

49:31.119 --> 49:35.385
-Looking for me?
-Oh, no. l was just looking for the loo.

49:35.557 --> 49:39.391
Outside? On the terrace?

49:41.496 --> 49:44.192
All right, so you caught me.

49:44.499 --> 49:49.562
So let me guess. You'll disappear again
without so much as a glass slipper?

49:51.539 --> 49:55.475
This Cinderella's got a dad now.
She's not going anywhere.

49:57.579 --> 50:01.015
-Your song was really beautiful.
-Thanks.

50:01.182 --> 50:06.381
lt's not gonna liven up this party,
though. Poor girls. l feel sorry for them.

50:06.554 --> 50:09.387
A dud like this will send them
back to social Siberia.

50:09.791 --> 50:13.591
What do you say we liven things up
a little bit? Get the party started.

50:13.761 --> 50:16.594
Well, first of all, l could get fired.

50:16.764 --> 50:19.892
-And second of all, l could get fired.
-Come on.

50:20.068 --> 50:21.399
-No.
-Wimp.

50:21.569 --> 50:25.733
-No. No.
-For me?

50:27.909 --> 50:30.571
Okay, let's do it.

50:32.580 --> 50:36.482
-lnsufferable deprivation of this house....
-Okay, guys.

50:36.651 --> 50:39.814
-One, two, three, four!
-l'm cranking up the bass!

50:41.856 --> 50:43.221
What?

51:51.192 --> 51:53.626
What the devil is going on?
ls that girl yours?

51:53.995 --> 51:55.826
Yes. Yes, she is.

51:55.997 --> 52:01.936
What do l tell my daughters when they're
lying awake crying over their ruined ball?

52:23.124 --> 52:24.853
No!

52:25.359 --> 52:27.759
Oh, my precious!

52:32.533 --> 52:33.864
You!

52:34.469 --> 52:36.300
We're going. Come on.

52:36.471 --> 52:38.371
Lord Dashwood!

53:27.085 --> 53:29.053
This is ridiculous.

54:21.272 --> 54:24.969
Have you seen the papers? lt's everywhere.
We have to do something.

54:27.445 --> 54:30.573
l don't know anyone that isn't
relieved to see that go.

54:31.349 --> 54:35.979
-What on Earth are you giving Henry?
-They're called Coco Pops, madam.

54:36.621 --> 54:39.784
-Morning.
-Hardhat, anyone?

54:39.957 --> 54:43.950
You never know when something
sharp might fall from the sky.

54:44.562 --> 54:47.759
-l'm most dreadfully sorry, miss.
-You idiot!

54:47.932 --> 54:52.528
These are my best suede Pradas. Do you
have any idea how expensive they are?

54:57.608 --> 55:01.544
l'm really sorry about last night.
l was just trying to help them out.

55:01.712 --> 55:03.805
Where did you find that revolting song?

55:03.981 --> 55:06.950
James Brown, 1 976,
charted out at number 1 4.

55:10.555 --> 55:13.456
l have no idea where that came from.

55:17.628 --> 55:19.095
What?

55:20.264 --> 55:23.427
Gillian, darling. Yes, l'm sorry,
it's just an awful time.

55:38.483 --> 55:41.213
What music did you listen to
when you were younger?

55:41.385 --> 55:44.946
-Back before the Earth's crust cooled?
-Favorite band of the '70s.

55:45.123 --> 55:46.647
Don't say the Bee Gees.

55:46.824 --> 55:49.725
-Don't say the Bee Gees.
-They were called Little Feat.

55:49.894 --> 55:53.022
And l saw them half a dozen times.
l remember they once--

55:53.197 --> 55:56.530
lt's 8:1 5 and you have an appointment
in Westminster at 9:1 5.

55:57.068 --> 55:59.832
Yes. Yes, you're right.

56:07.211 --> 56:08.940
See you later.

56:11.149 --> 56:14.550
Miss Daphne, Mr. Wallace
is here to see you.

56:14.719 --> 56:17.313
Don't let him in,
l'm not even cute yet!

56:19.924 --> 56:22.017
What am l gonna wear?

56:31.135 --> 56:33.831
Hello, sir. lan Wallace.

56:34.005 --> 56:35.563
l'm here to pick up Daphne.

56:41.179 --> 56:43.739
-How you doing?
-How do you do?

56:43.915 --> 56:45.314
Good.

56:48.085 --> 56:51.418
-Who are you?
-l'm a musician. l was at the ball last night.

56:52.757 --> 56:54.384
You were in the band?

56:56.327 --> 56:59.922
-Now you and Daphne are...?
-Eloping together? Yeah.

57:00.498 --> 57:05.265
l realize it's a bit sudden, but after last
night, there really was no turning back.

57:07.939 --> 57:10.430
-You're joking.
-Yes, sir.

57:14.912 --> 57:17.676
-Don't wait up, Henry.
-See you.

57:19.750 --> 57:21.240
-Wow.
-Okay.

57:21.419 --> 57:25.685
-So, what we need's a little cheering up?
-Hold the ''little.''

57:25.856 --> 57:27.153
Just leave it all to me.

57:32.196 --> 57:35.029
You ready? Let's go!

58:01.759 --> 58:03.590
Oh, hey, you gotta try these.

58:04.395 --> 58:06.989
These are great kebabs.
Can we have two?

58:07.164 --> 58:09.291
-Nice. Thank you.
-Thanks.

58:10.134 --> 58:12.625
This is awesome!

58:19.310 --> 58:21.278
l like these.

58:22.380 --> 58:24.348
Oh, my God. l love these.

58:24.515 --> 58:27.973
Yeah. This place has always got
really nice stuff. That suits you.

58:28.152 --> 58:29.414
-l'll get it.
-You sure?

58:29.587 --> 58:31.612
lt's fine. Honestly.

58:32.690 --> 58:33.952
-Wait, wait.
-What?

58:34.125 --> 58:36.355
-This is so pretty.
-Yeah.

58:37.194 --> 58:38.957
-You like?
-Yeah, it's cool.

58:46.037 --> 58:48.471
Looks good. Yeah, l like it.

58:53.077 --> 58:55.375
-Thanks for my bracelets.
-lt's okay.

58:55.846 --> 59:00.146
-Today was really fun. l needed it.
-Good. Glad you're enjoying yourself.

59:01.452 --> 59:05.980
-From now on l'm gonna behave.
-Behave like what, exactly?

59:06.157 --> 59:10.526
l don't know.
An impeccably brought up young lady.

59:10.695 --> 59:13.255
No more repeats of last night.

59:14.332 --> 59:17.790
Okay. Well, l just chose you to help!

59:26.444 --> 59:30.676
Okay, that's it.
Now gently slide your foot back.

59:34.285 --> 59:37.413
So much for gently. Hold this.

59:38.389 --> 59:41.916
You gotta think grace.
You gotta think poise.

59:42.560 --> 59:45.586
You gotta think balance.

59:46.297 --> 59:47.889
Observe.

59:49.467 --> 59:51.162
Nice!

59:51.702 --> 59:55.832
So tell me, Obi-Wan, where did
you learn your impressive skills?

59:56.006 --> 59:59.806
Well, if you really want to know,
believe it or not...

01:00:01.412 --> 01:00:03.539
-...my mother was a deb.
-Really?

01:00:03.714 --> 01:00:07.377
Yeah, and then she chose
to marry beneath her.

01:00:07.551 --> 01:00:09.610
Her parents promptly disowned her.

01:00:09.787 --> 01:00:13.689
But for some reason they took pity
on me, their half-breed grandson.

01:00:13.858 --> 01:00:18.921
They paid for me to go to the right schools.
They got me into all the right clubs.

01:00:19.397 --> 01:00:22.696
Until one day l realized
the hypocrisy of it all.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.127
And your parents?

01:00:25.302 --> 01:00:29.432
They're poor as church mice
and they're the happiest people l know.

01:00:30.775 --> 01:00:33.972
Now, enough stalling. Get up there
and let me see you perform.

01:00:34.145 --> 01:00:36.079
All right. All right.

01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:40.945
Okay. Find your center.

01:00:43.521 --> 01:00:45.716
Good. That's it.

01:00:46.657 --> 01:00:49.182
Okay. Now.

01:01:11.382 --> 01:01:14.044
You know what l still don't get?

01:01:14.585 --> 01:01:19.784
Why are you trying so hard to fit in
when you're born to stand out?

01:01:48.285 --> 01:01:50.219
<i>-Hello?
-Five hours ago your daughter...</i>

01:01:50.387 --> 01:01:53.413
...rode off on a motorcycle
and hasn't been heard from since.

01:01:53.958 --> 01:01:57.394
<i>-Are we talking about a date?
-I don't know, but I dread to think.</i>

01:01:57.561 --> 01:01:59.358
The boy's in some sort of band!

01:01:59.897 --> 01:02:03.560
Really? Cool. Let me guess,
he's a drummer.

01:02:04.068 --> 01:02:06.002
<i>-This is serious.
-As I recall...</i>

01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:09.503
...l spent a great deal of time
on the back of your motorbike.

01:02:09.673 --> 01:02:13.165
Yeah, well, l think
that's rather different.

01:02:15.079 --> 01:02:17.570
Strange how easy it comes, isn't it?

01:02:18.516 --> 01:02:21.076
-What?
-Worrying.

01:02:23.053 --> 01:02:27.854
-Does it ever go away?
-No, Henry, it doesn't.

01:02:33.130 --> 01:02:35.257
Henry! Henry!

01:02:35.432 --> 01:02:38.196
Libby, l'm sorry, l'm gonna have to run.

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:47.568
Darling, this really is important. l've just
had a conversation with a Bedouin translator.

01:02:47.745 --> 01:02:51.647
Apparently there are certain drums
which indicate an actual marriage...

01:02:51.815 --> 01:02:55.546
...whereas others they just use
merely for mating rituals.

01:02:55.719 --> 01:02:59.553
-Have l just entered a parallel universe?
-Don't you see what this means?

01:02:59.723 --> 01:03:03.250
lt's possible that you and Libby
never had a real wedding.

01:03:03.427 --> 01:03:06.794
So there's nothing to interfere
with our plans! ls there?

01:03:06.964 --> 01:03:09.831
lsn't that good news, Henry? Henry?

01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:42.064
Here we go.

01:03:45.703 --> 01:03:47.170
Hang on a second.

01:03:47.438 --> 01:03:53.240
-Hello, sir.
-lan. l had no idea you were so versatile.

01:03:53.410 --> 01:03:57.278
Henry, come along, lots to do.
The assembled press are waiting.

01:03:57.448 --> 01:03:58.915
Hi.

01:03:59.617 --> 01:04:04.281
-Hey. What are you doing here?
-Another one of my glamorous jobs.

01:04:06.857 --> 01:04:09.951
-You look beautiful.
-Thanks.

01:04:10.127 --> 01:04:12.925
-l have to be on my best behavior.
-You better be.

01:04:13.097 --> 01:04:17.693
-There's more reporters here than usual.
-They're waiting to see what l'll do next.

01:04:17.868 --> 01:04:21.964
Oh, yeah? You mean like kissing a guy
who parks cars?

01:04:24.942 --> 01:04:26.409
Daphne, the press...

01:04:26.577 --> 01:04:31.708
-...want a photo of you and your father.
-Thanks. l'll find him.

01:04:32.383 --> 01:04:33.714
See you.

01:04:33.884 --> 01:04:36.717
Stay away from her, peasant.
She's out of your league.

01:04:36.887 --> 01:04:40.687
What's the matter? Thought our competition
ended in lower school.

01:04:40.858 --> 01:04:43.656
Afraid she might prefer musicians
to Cambridge boys?

01:04:43.827 --> 01:04:47.354
No. Breeding always
wins out in the end.

01:04:49.867 --> 01:04:52.665
ls Miss Reynolds enjoying
her time in London?

01:04:52.903 --> 01:04:55.838
-Very much.
-Lord Dashwood, how's the campaign?

01:04:56.006 --> 01:04:58.566
Miss Reynolds, tell us
about the chandelier.

01:04:58.742 --> 01:05:00.073
Maybe that's enough.

01:05:00.244 --> 01:05:01.905
Thank you, no more now.

01:05:02.746 --> 01:05:05.840
-Do you think he's terribly rich?
-l imagine so.

01:05:06.016 --> 01:05:08.348
-l hope so.
-Peach?

01:05:08.552 --> 01:05:11.851
Pear? You look...

01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:15.754
-...different.
-lt's Daphne.

01:05:15.926 --> 01:05:21.057
-She gave us some styling tips.
-Why would you want tips from her?

01:05:27.271 --> 01:05:28.704
Lovely.

01:05:28.872 --> 01:05:30.737
-Charming here.
-lsn't it just?

01:05:48.158 --> 01:05:50.217
The race is that way.

01:05:50.394 --> 01:05:53.022
Aren't you supposed
to be escorting Clarissa?

01:05:53.197 --> 01:05:56.792
What? And leave you
to fend for yourself?

01:05:57.534 --> 01:06:00.731
Or are you suffering
from the romantic delusion...

01:06:00.904 --> 01:06:04.340
...that some non-talent commoner
will do it for you?

01:06:04.508 --> 01:06:09.411
You know, l really wish you'd pull
your lip over your head and swallow it.

01:06:10.848 --> 01:06:16.809
Despite myself, l find your Yankee
vulgarity intensely attractive.

01:06:16.987 --> 01:06:19.820
So forget about the car parking,
mixed-race mongrel...

01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:24.586
...and give me that kiss you've been
longing to give me since we first met.

01:06:24.762 --> 01:06:26.195
You're right.

01:06:26.363 --> 01:06:28.991
l have been longing to do this.

01:06:46.884 --> 01:06:48.715
Henry, do something!

01:06:51.288 --> 01:06:52.846
You should have hit him!

01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:56.682
Don't you ever pucker your lips
at me, you arrogant jerk!

01:06:56.860 --> 01:07:00.523
And how dare you insult lan?!
He's twice the man you'll ever be!

01:07:08.672 --> 01:07:12.438
-Henry. Henry.
-Out of the way. Get out of the way.

01:07:12.709 --> 01:07:14.734
What was the argument about?

01:07:20.818 --> 01:07:24.310
-Give me the keys to your bike! Quick!
-Here you go.

01:07:26.790 --> 01:07:28.724
What's going on?

01:07:28.892 --> 01:07:31.019
You do know how to drive--

01:07:31.962 --> 01:07:33.691
Look out!

01:07:36.433 --> 01:07:38.458
Oh, sorry.

01:08:04.661 --> 01:08:08.392
That is without doubt the most
indecorous thing l have done in years.

01:08:08.565 --> 01:08:12.126
Well, l have no idea
what you're talking about, but l'm glad.

01:08:12.502 --> 01:08:14.094
You should do it more often.

01:08:14.271 --> 01:08:17.138
l don't even remember
the last time l went barefoot.

01:08:18.108 --> 01:08:21.042
Don't you just love squidging
your toes in the sand?

01:08:21.211 --> 01:08:23.406
Did you know it's a natural exfoliant?

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:28.040
Mom says if you can walk on a beach and
you got a steady hand with nail polish...

01:08:28.218 --> 01:08:31.585
...there's no reason to ever pay
for a pedicure.

01:08:31.854 --> 01:08:35.291
-You talk just like her, you know.
-As in too much?

01:08:38.127 --> 01:08:39.925
ls she happy?

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:49.129
Yeah, l think so. l mean, l can tell
she gets lonely sometimes...

01:08:49.706 --> 01:08:53.038
...but l think she's pretty content
with who she is.

01:08:56.046 --> 01:09:00.676
-l like that about her.
-l wish l were more like that.

01:09:05.322 --> 01:09:06.584
So, what next?

01:09:08.457 --> 01:09:10.323
-No!
-Yes!

01:09:10.493 --> 01:09:14.760
-No. No, absolutely not.
-lt's this or that.

01:09:17.834 --> 01:09:20.131
l think we'll do this one.

01:09:22.738 --> 01:09:24.866
How're you doing?

01:09:26.944 --> 01:09:28.707
Henry?

01:09:29.479 --> 01:09:31.447
That doesn't sound pleasant.

01:09:33.617 --> 01:09:36.245
-What do you think?
-lt's just henna.

01:10:07.117 --> 01:10:09.347
-What's this?
-l told you how groovy l was?

01:10:09.519 --> 01:10:12.352
-Yeah.
-And l used to like people like this guy.

01:10:12.923 --> 01:10:16.051
Oh, look. This stuff is good.

01:10:16.226 --> 01:10:19.093
l've been looking for Coo Coo Ow!
Strange, funky sounds.

01:10:19.262 --> 01:10:21.890
l remember them. ''Doris.''

01:10:35.712 --> 01:10:38.078
-Come on, Henry.
-l'm not gonna head bang.

01:10:38.248 --> 01:10:41.217
-You just bang your head.
-Don't do that. No.

01:10:41.385 --> 01:10:45.048
-Nod!
-l'm not gonna do that. All right. Let's go.

01:11:30.367 --> 01:11:33.530
l was just-- l wanted
to see if they still fit.

01:11:34.104 --> 01:11:36.732
Well, they seem fine.

01:11:38.141 --> 01:11:42.908
Who are you? What have you
done with my fiancé?

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.514
l want my Henry back.

01:11:56.827 --> 01:11:58.522
-Lord Dashwood.
-Lord Dashwood.

01:11:58.695 --> 01:12:01.027
You've dropped 1 5 points in the polls.

01:12:01.198 --> 01:12:03.462
-Are you worried?
-l really can't comment.

01:12:03.633 --> 01:12:08.002
lf you can't handle your own child,
how can you handle the government?

01:12:09.306 --> 01:12:13.766
-Frank, good to see you.
-Could you answer, please?

01:12:15.545 --> 01:12:17.536
-How much time do we have?
-Plenty.

01:12:17.714 --> 01:12:20.046
Your first two clients
were no-shows and...

01:12:20.217 --> 01:12:23.618
...you got out of your speech
at the Children's Education Center.

01:12:23.787 --> 01:12:28.349
-Why would we have canceled that speech?
-We didn't. They did.

01:12:55.185 --> 01:12:57.153
Daphne, can l have a word?

01:12:58.188 --> 01:13:03.387
This is Brigadier Sir Roderick Dashwood.
He lost an eye at the Battle of the Boyne.

01:13:04.928 --> 01:13:08.329
And over here we have Field Marshal
Bingley Dashwood.

01:13:08.498 --> 01:13:10.898
He lost his arm
at the Battle of the Nile.

01:13:13.170 --> 01:13:18.005
And Uncle Alfred never spoke about what
he lost, but you'd rarely find him sitting.

01:13:18.875 --> 01:13:22.675
l lost my tonsils.
Does that mean l qualify?

01:13:24.314 --> 01:13:25.975
Listen, Daphne.

01:13:27.150 --> 01:13:31.712
Part of the burden of being a member
of this family is that there are certain...

01:13:31.888 --> 01:13:35.756
...codes of behavior
that one is expected to observe.

01:13:36.726 --> 01:13:39.923
And if one is not seen
to conform, then....

01:13:41.097 --> 01:13:43.088
Well, then it becomes....

01:13:45.001 --> 01:13:49.233
Listen, l've very much enjoyed
our time together.

01:13:49.806 --> 01:13:53.037
Really and truly. lt's just that this....

01:13:53.210 --> 01:13:57.146
These are very difficult circumstances...

01:13:59.082 --> 01:14:02.483
...and you, as my daughter,
have to....

01:14:03.253 --> 01:14:04.777
l have to change.

01:14:06.456 --> 01:14:08.617
lt's okay, l get it.

01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:15.097
-l'm.... l'm a Dashwood too, right?
-Yes.

01:14:16.366 --> 01:14:17.993
Yes, you are.

01:14:32.949 --> 01:14:38.444
What are you looking at?
l can do it.

01:16:11.147 --> 01:16:13.672
Not wearing that
to The Strokes concert, are you?

01:16:13.850 --> 01:16:16.614
Oh, my God, l totally forgot!

01:16:17.754 --> 01:16:20.052
-Things have been so hectic.
-That's okay.

01:16:20.223 --> 01:16:22.851
l'll wait for you to get changed.

01:16:23.293 --> 01:16:26.854
l can't go. We're going
to the queen's garden party.

01:16:27.931 --> 01:16:30.900
-Yeah, but....
-l'm sorry.

01:16:32.635 --> 01:16:34.102
Cool.

01:16:35.105 --> 01:16:38.905
Just call me when Daphne
re-inhabits your body.

01:16:58.928 --> 01:17:04.332
-And this is Miss Daphne Reynolds.
-Oh, Daphne.

01:17:05.168 --> 01:17:07.227
Nice girl.

01:17:08.538 --> 01:17:12.941
l gather Her Majesty's accepted
an invitation to Daphne's ball.

01:17:13.109 --> 01:17:17.478
She's come a long way, l must say.
You must be very proud of her.

01:17:26.055 --> 01:17:27.682
No.

01:17:38.101 --> 01:17:42.970
This is the tiara that l wore
at my own coming-out party.

01:17:43.606 --> 01:17:47.064
Clarissa's had her beady eye
on it for months.

01:17:47.243 --> 01:17:49.711
But l want you to have it.

01:17:58.354 --> 01:18:02.381
-So royal.
-l hope it makes you feel like a princess.

01:18:03.259 --> 01:18:07.889
But you know, my dear,
it's not the crown that makes the queen.

01:18:09.065 --> 01:18:10.965
lt's what's in here.

01:18:27.884 --> 01:18:31.445
-Hello.
-Ladies.

01:18:36.092 --> 01:18:37.719
Well, yes, of course.

01:18:52.942 --> 01:18:54.375
Here she comes.

01:19:36.686 --> 01:19:38.415
Daphne.

01:19:38.821 --> 01:19:42.382
-You look....
-Different?

01:20:10.787 --> 01:20:13.449
-Can we talk for a sec?
-lt's your party.

01:20:13.623 --> 01:20:16.956
-You can do whatever you want.
-lan.

01:20:17.126 --> 01:20:20.220
-l really didn't--
-l don't want to hear about it, Daph.

01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:24.828
What happened to the old you?
The real you?

01:20:27.971 --> 01:20:32.203
Okay, lads, let's pick up the tempo.

01:20:45.688 --> 01:20:47.451
Mom!

01:20:52.295 --> 01:20:53.557
What are you doing here?

01:20:53.730 --> 01:20:57.530
Jocelyn thought you might need a pal
while being fed to the sharks.

01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:00.362
Oh, honey, you look so beautiful.

01:21:00.536 --> 01:21:03.198
Look at you, Mom!

01:21:04.073 --> 01:21:06.541
Are you actually wearing a bra?

01:21:14.283 --> 01:21:15.841
Come on.

01:21:22.859 --> 01:21:24.793
Hello, Henry.

01:21:26.029 --> 01:21:27.621
Libby.

01:21:29.399 --> 01:21:35.395
-Hello, Lucy. l'm Glynnis, Henry's fiancée.
-lt's Libby, actually. And congratulations.

01:21:35.838 --> 01:21:41.105
Well, what a lovely surprise.
l see you've come with no escort.

01:21:41.277 --> 01:21:45.077
Henry, you must find somebody divine
for Lubby here to dance with.

01:21:45.248 --> 01:21:47.546
Libby. Remember?

01:21:48.851 --> 01:21:52.082
And why doesn't he just
ask her himself?

01:22:38.267 --> 01:22:42.670
This is fantastic. Everyone important
has accepted their invitation.

01:22:43.139 --> 01:22:47.473
-We've got the election in the bag.
-How can you be so calm?

01:22:47.643 --> 01:22:51.943
Her Majesty is due any moment and your
candidate is dancing with that woman.

01:22:52.115 --> 01:22:53.707
Henry knows what's at stake.

01:22:53.883 --> 01:22:57.683
Besides, look what he did with Daphne.
Quite an achievement.

01:22:57.854 --> 01:23:01.449
l thought l was going to have to get rid
of her, like her mother, but--

01:23:01.624 --> 01:23:03.023
What did you just say?

01:23:03.192 --> 01:23:05.126
Nothing.

01:23:05.294 --> 01:23:08.525
-Did you say you got rid of my mother?
-Figure of speech.

01:23:09.632 --> 01:23:13.591
-Are you the one that made her leave?
-Daphne, darling, now is not the time.

01:23:13.770 --> 01:23:18.036
-Come on now, don't linger!
-Hey, but-- Glynnis!

01:23:18.207 --> 01:23:21.233
-How dare he!
-Come on.

01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:23.742
-Come on!
-Glynnis, let go!

01:23:23.913 --> 01:23:27.076
-Get in here!
-Glynnis! Let go!

01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:29.150
Get in here!

01:23:29.652 --> 01:23:32.644
Glynnis! Glynnis!
Glynnis!

01:23:40.730 --> 01:23:42.163
Remember the ritual dances?

01:23:42.331 --> 01:23:45.357
You were so bad
they're still blaming you for the locusts.

01:23:45.535 --> 01:23:49.699
-l recall your frock nearly got us arrested.
-l had you translate my apology.

01:23:49.872 --> 01:23:53.672
-Which was something of a risk, l thought.
-l know it. You could've been...

01:23:53.843 --> 01:23:56.641
-...trading me in for a goat.
-Camel, actually.

01:23:56.813 --> 01:23:59.213
Which never came through,
by the way.

01:24:00.483 --> 01:24:02.576
l had faith in you, Henry.

01:24:05.154 --> 01:24:07.281
Just not enough?

01:24:07.456 --> 01:24:10.584
You didn't say goodbye.
You just disappeared.

01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:14.321
-lt was what you wanted.
-What l wanted?

01:24:14.497 --> 01:24:18.695
-What l wanted was to be given a chance.
-You have had 1 7 years of chances, Henry...

01:24:18.868 --> 01:24:23.601
...and l've had 1 7 years
of waiting for you to take them.

01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:29.605
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

01:24:29.779 --> 01:24:33.681
...the traditional father-daughter dance.
Lord Dashwood?

01:24:38.621 --> 01:24:40.111
Please!

01:24:40.923 --> 01:24:42.220
Help!

01:24:42.825 --> 01:24:44.417
-Where is Daphne?
-l'll find her.

01:24:44.594 --> 01:24:47.722
Oh, no.
Has Daphne gone missing again?

01:24:49.498 --> 01:24:52.524
Maybe Clarissa can step in.
You wouldn't mind, would you?

01:24:52.702 --> 01:24:55.193
No. l'm almost your daughter
now too.

01:24:57.373 --> 01:24:59.341
Well, l'd....

01:25:08.918 --> 01:25:10.579
-Help! Someone!
-Daphne?

01:25:10.753 --> 01:25:12.948
l can't miss
my own father-daughter dance!

01:25:13.122 --> 01:25:14.749
-Honey?
-Help!

01:25:28.170 --> 01:25:31.628
-How dare you, Glynnis? How dare you!
-We don't want a scene, do we?

01:25:31.807 --> 01:25:36.369
Take your hand off my daughter or you won't
get a scene, you'll get a Broadway musical.

01:25:54.697 --> 01:25:56.426
-Daphne....
-What are you doing?

01:25:56.933 --> 01:25:59.993
Finally giving you what you deserve.

01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:06.471
Go ahead.

01:26:08.177 --> 01:26:09.906
l don't want it.

01:26:11.514 --> 01:26:12.981
Any of it.

01:26:32.101 --> 01:26:33.591
Daphne!

01:26:34.003 --> 01:26:35.493
Daphne!

01:26:36.339 --> 01:26:39.900
-Wait.
-No.

01:26:42.745 --> 01:26:45.441
l'm done waiting, Henry.

01:26:53.189 --> 01:26:58.957
You know, when l was little, every birthday
l'd get all dressed up and l'd wish...

01:26:59.462 --> 01:27:04.866
...that if l was good enough,
you'd come and find me.

01:27:07.670 --> 01:27:12.607
And now here l am, in the most beautiful
dress l could ever imagine...

01:27:14.110 --> 01:27:16.044
...and you're here.

01:27:17.847 --> 01:27:22.716
You know what l miss now?
l miss being me.

01:27:24.286 --> 01:27:27.187
l finally realized that that is enough.

01:27:33.029 --> 01:27:35.463
You know, Daphne....

01:27:36.932 --> 01:27:42.734
Maybe we're just trying
to make something work here which isn't.

01:27:42.905 --> 01:27:47.808
Pray be upstanding
for Her Majesty, the queen.

01:28:02.291 --> 01:28:04.418
Go ahead.

01:28:05.061 --> 01:28:06.551
Duty calls.

01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:13.327
Come on, honey.

01:30:21.797 --> 01:30:24.960
-Lord Dashwood! What is your priority?
-Thank you very much.

01:30:25.134 --> 01:30:28.069
-The election or your daughter?
-l have no comment.

01:30:36.412 --> 01:30:39.745
-Couldn't you sleep either?
-No.

01:30:41.784 --> 01:30:44.378
Made a bit of a mess of things,
haven't l?

01:30:44.553 --> 01:30:46.077
A bit.

01:30:47.656 --> 01:30:52.116
Henry, for six centuries this family
has been sacrificing bits of itself for England.

01:30:52.294 --> 01:30:57.630
Arms, legs, eyes. The battlefields of Europe
are littered with them.

01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:01.667
Don't follow in that glorious tradition.

01:31:03.372 --> 01:31:06.273
You know what you're going
to sacrifice?

01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:11.172
Your heart, Henry.

01:31:45.314 --> 01:31:46.804
Sir Charles.

01:32:00.296 --> 01:32:01.957
Thank you.

01:32:03.365 --> 01:32:04.491
Thank you.

01:32:06.935 --> 01:32:08.664
Thank you.

01:32:10.506 --> 01:32:12.098
Thank you.

01:32:12.274 --> 01:32:14.606
Well, over the last few weeks,
l've certainly...

01:32:14.777 --> 01:32:18.736
...received more support and encouragement
from this constituency...

01:32:18.914 --> 01:32:23.817
...than l'd ever dared hoped for. So l'd like
to take this opportunity to thank you all.

01:32:26.188 --> 01:32:32.491
You may have noticed that recently there
have been one or two remarks in the press.

01:32:32.661 --> 01:32:35.061
Regarding my behavior.

01:32:35.698 --> 01:32:40.226
lt's been suggested l've not been conducting
myself in a manner befitting an MP.

01:32:41.737 --> 01:32:45.195
Well, l've been giving my priorities
a great deal of thought...

01:32:45.708 --> 01:32:49.508
...and l've decided that it's time
to get them straight.

01:32:49.678 --> 01:32:53.444
Which is why l must now respectfully
withdraw my candidacy.

01:32:58.754 --> 01:33:04.158
Representing you would undoubtedly
be the greatest honor of my political life.

01:33:04.593 --> 01:33:09.929
lt would simply be impossible to do so
if l'm not serving my own conscience.

01:33:11.266 --> 01:33:12.756
See...

01:33:17.806 --> 01:33:19.706
...l've changed.

01:33:26.415 --> 01:33:30.647
And as important
as my political aspirations are to me...

01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:34.114
...there is one thing
that matters more.

01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:46.561
Thank you.

01:34:08.857 --> 01:34:10.347
Are you out of your mind?

01:34:10.926 --> 01:34:13.690
l have done everything
to get you to this position...

01:34:13.862 --> 01:34:16.023
...and l will not let you
throw it all away!

01:34:16.198 --> 01:34:18.462
You've lied to me,
l know you lied to Libby...

01:34:18.634 --> 01:34:21.762
...so forgive me if l don't give
a flying fart what you think.

01:34:21.937 --> 01:34:24.997
Libby? l stopped you
from ruining your life!

01:34:25.174 --> 01:34:27.768
l saved your family's reputation!

01:34:27.943 --> 01:34:32.004
When l found out that girl was pregnant,
l knew l was doing the right thing.

01:34:34.216 --> 01:34:37.708
-You knew about Daphne?
-Of course l knew! lt's my job to know!

01:34:40.656 --> 01:34:42.647
-Grandpa! Are you okay?
-Oh, God.

01:34:43.158 --> 01:34:44.955
-This is horrible.
-Do shut up!

01:34:46.428 --> 01:34:50.728
Henry, darling! l know Daddy's been naughty,
but what about me?

01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:53.663
You'll survive.

01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:15.620
Hey. Table six is screaming for coffee.
What're you doing, anyway?

01:35:15.791 --> 01:35:18.692
Sorry, it's my college applications.
Due on Monday.

01:35:18.861 --> 01:35:20.988
Okay, l'll cover for you.

01:35:21.163 --> 01:35:23.688
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

01:35:28.904 --> 01:35:33.705
Ladies and gentlemen, the bride
would like to share a dance with her father.

01:35:34.877 --> 01:35:36.811
l love you, Dad.

01:36:31.767 --> 01:36:35.669
-What are you doing here?
-l just came because l....

01:36:36.405 --> 01:36:41.069
l had something very important
to say to you...

01:36:41.243 --> 01:36:45.339
...and l hope l can.... Actually,
l wrote it all down on the plane about....

01:36:47.182 --> 01:36:49.673
About 200 times, as you....

01:36:53.488 --> 01:36:56.321
lt was on a....
l have it....

01:36:56.491 --> 01:36:59.585
What it comes down to is....

01:37:01.096 --> 01:37:03.428
ls that l love you, Daphne.

01:37:03.599 --> 01:37:07.160
l love you.
l'm so sorry.

01:37:07.336 --> 01:37:11.864
l wouldn't change you, anything about you.
l wouldn't change one hair on your head.

01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:15.806
-Not for anything--
-l love you, Dad. l love you!

01:37:34.997 --> 01:37:36.589
Might l....

01:37:37.332 --> 01:37:39.800
Might l have the honor of this dance?

01:38:20.575 --> 01:38:23.169
Listen, Daphne, l....

01:38:23.912 --> 01:38:28.315
l just think when you're groveling
it's important to bring a very large present.

01:38:28.817 --> 01:38:31.615
-l don't understand.
-May l cut in?

01:38:31.787 --> 01:38:33.345
Of course.

01:38:36.291 --> 01:38:38.486
l tried to call you....

01:38:50.572 --> 01:38:53.700
You never did want me to go,
did you?

01:38:53.875 --> 01:38:56.366
There never was anyone else,
was there?

01:38:58.613 --> 01:39:01.707
l'd say l owe you
a rather large apology.

01:39:02.884 --> 01:39:06.376
You think l've waited 1 7 years
for an apology?

01:39:16.264 --> 01:39:19.665
<i>So I finally got my father-daughter dance.</i>

01:39:19.835 --> 01:39:23.271
<i>Of course, it got interrupted
when my boyfriend showed up.</i>

01:39:23.939 --> 01:39:26.669
<i>And then my parents started making out.</i>

01:39:31.513 --> 01:39:36.246
<i>But sometimes things aren't exactly
how you always imagined.</i>

01:39:36.618 --> 01:39:38.745
<i>They're even better.</i>

01:39:52.234 --> 01:39:56.295
<i>Oh, just in case you were wondering
what happened to Clarissa and Glynnis...</i>

01:39:56.471 --> 01:40:01.101
<i>...don't worry.
They ended up exactly as they should.</i>

01:40:03.178 --> 01:40:06.147
--the rustication, then it gets smoother--

01:40:06.314 --> 01:40:07.941
<i>-Big Ben.
-So did Alistair.</i>

01:40:08.116 --> 01:40:11.176
l can see the smiles.
For those of you who speak English...

01:40:11.353 --> 01:40:14.652
...it's not the name of a large hamburger
at a fast food restaurant.

01:40:14.823 --> 01:40:17.053
<i>This is the closest he got
to Parliament.</i>

01:40:18.727 --> 01:40:24.222
<i>My parents got married again.
This time, it was legal.</i>

01:40:24.399 --> 01:40:26.094
<i>I think.</i>

01:40:29.437 --> 01:40:32.201
<i>As for me, I didn't end up at NYU.</i>

01:40:32.374 --> 01:40:37.505
<i>But before you get too disappointed,
I did get into Oxford.</i>

01:40:37.846 --> 01:40:42.442
<i>What can I say?
Like father, like daughter.</i>

01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:48.686
<i>It was my own happily ever after.</i>
