Previously on Hawaii Five-O...
Michelle Shioma’s 20 million.

00:04.571 --> 00:06.206
You’re gonna get it
and hand it over.

00:06.206 --> 00:07.875
ADAM: Jessie, this
is Mr. Kimura.

00:07.875 --> 00:09.276
He’s an old friend
of my father’s.

00:09.276 --> 00:10.577
What the hell is this place?

00:10.577 --> 00:12.813
It’s sort of an unofficial bank
for the Yakuza.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.681
I need to make a withdrawal.

00:15.949 --> 00:18.285
We just had a body wash up
on Kaalawai Beach.

00:18.285 --> 00:20.587
It’s Noriko, Adam’s sister.

00:20.587 --> 00:22.289
TANI:
Adam just saved

00:22.289 --> 00:24.892
my brother’s life. I’m supposed
to repay him by turning him in?

00:24.892 --> 00:27.127
You’re a cop, and
you took an oath.

00:27.127 --> 00:29.563
If Adam killed his sister,
you need to do the right thing.

00:29.563 --> 00:30.664
Why’d you put that
at my house?

00:30.664 --> 00:32.165
TANI:
I didn’t, Adam.

00:32.165 --> 00:33.700
I found it there
when you were away.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.402
You’re telling me
it’s sheer coincidence

00:35.402 --> 00:37.504
that a gun
I’ve never seen before

00:37.504 --> 00:39.673
turns up in my drawer
right after you’ve been there?

00:39.673 --> 00:41.208
Let’s go, guys.
And then three hours later,

00:41.208 --> 00:43.043
HPD shows up
with a search warrant?

00:43.043 --> 00:44.278
But if you didn’t plant the gun

00:44.278 --> 00:47.981
and you didn’t tip the cops,
who the hell did?

01:08.568 --> 01:10.170
MASUDA:
Mr. Kimura.

01:10.170 --> 01:14.041
We called you here
to relieve you of your duties.

01:14.041 --> 01:17.444
You will no longer serve
as our banker.

01:17.444 --> 01:20.414
Masuda-san, may I ask why?

01:20.414 --> 01:22.449
Noriko Noshimuri.

01:23.550 --> 01:25.252
You had her killed

01:25.252 --> 01:28.956
and attempted to frame
Adam Noshimuri, did you not?

01:28.956 --> 01:31.024
You are meant to be a ghost.

01:31.024 --> 01:33.093
To move among the shadows.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.896
Instead these rash actions
have drawn

01:35.896 --> 01:38.098
unwelcome attention to us all.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.802
M-Masuda-san...

01:41.802 --> 01:45.205
I-I was protecting
your interests.

01:45.205 --> 01:49.309
Adam Noshimuri
was withdrawing money

01:49.309 --> 01:52.980
that was paying
his father’s debt to you.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.983
Some things are worth more
than money.

01:55.983 --> 01:58.719
We are sometimes allies,

01:58.719 --> 02:00.087
sometimes rivals.

02:00.087 --> 02:02.255
To function as our banker,

02:02.255 --> 02:05.192
your neutrality and honor
must be unquestioned.

02:05.192 --> 02:07.027
When you act

02:07.027 --> 02:10.530
against any one of us,
you betray us all.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.167
Now, in recognition

02:14.167 --> 02:18.105
of your years of service,
we offer a choice.

02:20.540 --> 02:22.809
Yakuza justice...

02:25.012 --> 02:27.080
...or Five-O justice.

where we’ve had reports
of drug activity.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.958
Looks like we got
something here.

03:15.028 --> 03:18.065
I now have video evidence
of a drug transaction.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.499
I’m moving in.

03:33.313 --> 03:35.148
Yo, are you filming me?

03:35.148 --> 03:36.783
On your knees. I’m making
a citizen’s arrest.

03:36.783 --> 03:37.984
Turn that off.

04:06.346 --> 04:07.981
(panting)

04:22.729 --> 04:25.065
Okay, you saw
what just happened.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.967
He pulled a gun on me.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.536
I’m gonna need to wait here
for the police to file a report

04:29.536 --> 04:31.371
and turn over the firearm.

04:31.371 --> 04:33.707
Hopefully they can ID our perp

04:33.707 --> 04:37.010
and track him down.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.945
In the meantime...

04:42.015 --> 04:44.951
...let’s take a look
and see what we got here.

04:49.389 --> 04:51.458
Looks like about a dozen bags
of methamphetamine.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.760
Not a bad night’s work.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.996
The good people of Hawaii
can sleep safer tonight

04:55.996 --> 04:56.997
knowing that these drugs are...

One problem with that.

Looks to me like maybe somebody
trailed our vic here.

06:32.325 --> 06:34.327
Waited, saw this confrontation,

06:34.327 --> 06:35.895
saw it

Took him out.

Guys like this try

06:44.070 --> 06:46.539
They jump into situations
they’re not trained for.

06:46.539 --> 06:49.175
They put themselves

06:49.175 --> 06:52.379
They should just leave law
enforcement to professionals.

You know, you see

when he was on patrol.

difference in their communities,

07:33.086 --> 07:36.790
but Night Sentinel
actually did something.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.558
Guy was fearless.

07:38.558 --> 07:40.327
Yeah, I mean, you know,
you get involved

07:40.327 --> 07:41.728
in the kind of stuff
he’s involved with,

07:41.728 --> 07:43.463
eventually you’re gonna make
some enemies, right?

07:43.463 --> 07:45.098
Yeah, but the
people that matter,

07:45.098 --> 07:47.300
the folks
in these neighborhoods,

07:47.300 --> 07:49.602
they loved him.

07:49.602 --> 07:51.671
Made ’em feel safe.

07:51.671 --> 07:54.374
This park used to be
a no-go zone.

07:54.374 --> 07:56.009
Now it’s, I don’t know,

07:56.009 --> 07:57.744
maybe the odd dealer.

07:57.744 --> 07:59.946
Night Sentinel
was winning the war.

07:59.946 --> 08:01.815
Well, speaking of that,

It’s okay. It’s gonna be okay.

08:15.628 --> 08:18.298
These videos go back to 2015,

08:18.298 --> 08:20.567
when Night Sentinel first
came on the scene.

08:20.567 --> 08:22.302
There’s over a hundred of them,

08:22.302 --> 08:24.838
and those are just the ones
he deemed good enough to post.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.606
GROVER:
According to HPD records,

08:26.606 --> 08:29.309
Gene Wahale made 37
citizen’s arrests.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.811
Everything from vandalism
to armed robbery.

08:31.811 --> 08:33.847
This guy was
a serious vigilante.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.348
His bread and butter seemed
to be the drug trade.

08:35.348 --> 08:38.585
That accounts for two-thirds
of his busts.

08:38.585 --> 08:41.221
That’s the other thing--
you take out enough dealers,

08:41.221 --> 08:43.823
you’re gonna seriously impact
somebody’s distribution network.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.125
Now, that’s got
to have consequences.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.093
Mm-hmm, and the comments
on these videos

08:47.093 --> 08:48.661
seem to be making
the same point.

08:48.661 --> 08:49.596
Check this out.

08:51.164 --> 08:54.567
I-I don’t know what that means.
Can you help me, millennials?

08:54.567 --> 08:59.205
Okay, well, gangs now use
emoji code to make threats.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.007
So, scissors means
"I’m gonna cut you."

09:01.007 --> 09:02.809
And then look at this one.

09:02.809 --> 09:05.045
Skull, right arrow,

09:05.045 --> 09:06.146
fire emoji?

09:06.146 --> 09:07.046
"Die in a fire."

09:08.148 --> 09:09.949
And those are
some of the nicer ones.

09:09.949 --> 09:12.585
Okay, clearly half the island’s
criminals wanted this guy dead.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.791
STEVE: Why’d you post
those threatening comments?

09:17.791 --> 09:19.492
NIKO:
Sorry, guys,

09:19.492 --> 09:21.928
you can keep asking,
it’s not gonna change my answer.

09:21.928 --> 09:23.530
Never heard of no Gene...

09:23.530 --> 09:25.632
STEVE:
Wahale. Gene Wahale.

09:25.632 --> 09:28.468
Or Night Sentinel,
as he liked to call himself

09:28.468 --> 09:30.603
when he was out making citizen’s
arrests of local drug dealers.

09:30.603 --> 09:32.038

09:32.038 --> 09:34.574
He’s the guy who, uh, put
him away for ten years.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.210
Any bells going off now?

09:37.210 --> 09:41.714
Sorry, still no idea
what you’re talking about.

09:41.714 --> 09:43.083
Yeah, okay, Niko,
how about this?

09:43.083 --> 09:45.151
I’m gonna give you a little
tip, okay, for your life.

09:45.151 --> 09:47.554
If you ever manage to
spend any substantial time

09:47.554 --> 09:50.290
outside of a prison, and
you want to kill somebody,

09:50.290 --> 09:52.659
don’t tell them,
don’t write it down,

09:52.659 --> 09:54.227
"I want to kill you,"

09:54.227 --> 09:56.329
i-in the comments section
of their page. Okay?

09:56.329 --> 09:58.398
GROVER:
And remember,

09:58.398 --> 10:00.300
two Ls in "kill."

10:02.268 --> 10:05.839
Okay. Okay.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.974
Am I glad the freak’s dead?
Sure.

10:07.974 --> 10:10.844
And, yes, I-I love my brother.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.179
But I’m not interested
in becoming his cellmate.

10:13.179 --> 10:14.547
You expect us to believe

10:14.547 --> 10:17.784
that, uh, all that talk
was just, what, idle threats?

10:17.784 --> 10:18.852
Is that it?

10:18.852 --> 10:20.920
Like I told the cops,

10:20.920 --> 10:22.622
last night I was
at one of the island’s

10:22.622 --> 10:25.325
finest gentleman’s clubs
till around 3:00 a.m.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.026
Dropped two Gs
on my credit card.

10:27.026 --> 10:29.596
You can check that
if you want.

10:29.596 --> 10:31.097
Hmm, maybe I’m not
as dumb as I look, huh?

10:31.097 --> 10:32.532
GROVER:
Yeah, ’cause

10:32.532 --> 10:34.300
nothing says genius
like dropping two grand

10:34.300 --> 10:35.702
at a strip club.

10:35.702 --> 10:38.171
Doofus.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.273
So, Niko’s alibi
at the club checked out.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.909
He’s not our guy.
Well, of course not.

10:42.909 --> 10:45.678
Neither are the other
16 guys we’ve been looking into,

10:45.678 --> 10:47.847
and they were the most
promising ones we had.

10:47.847 --> 10:49.649
We got a bunch more names
on that list.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.919
True, but no one who’s
been convicted and sentenced.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.221
Our guy was a thorn
in the side of local hoods.

10:55.221 --> 10:56.556
But most of those cases

10:56.556 --> 10:58.324
are still tied up
in the legal system,

10:58.324 --> 11:01.194
and a bunch of them have just
fallen apart over due process.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.762
Evidence contamination,

11:02.762 --> 11:04.697
chain of custody,
false imprisonment.

11:04.697 --> 11:06.166
Wait a minute. Hold on.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.901
If-if the guys that
Night Sentinel had arrested

11:07.901 --> 11:09.936
are getting off light,
it doesn’t make any sense

11:09.936 --> 11:12.539
that they’d be risking
murder charges.

11:12.539 --> 11:15.008
Maybe this wasn’t retaliation
for a bust after all.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.376
Okay, well, then what was it?

11:20.380 --> 11:22.849
TANI: Well, you know, at least
you don’t have to keep looking

11:22.849 --> 11:24.317
over your shoulder
everywhere you go now.

11:24.317 --> 11:27.687
It’s also not the worst way to
start your career at Five-O.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.856
You know, bringing in
Kimura on a murder charge.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.457
It was an easy arrest.

11:31.457 --> 11:33.326
Kimura knew that spending
the rest of his life

11:33.326 --> 11:34.761
in a six-by-eight
was far better

11:34.761 --> 11:36.629
than what the Yakuza
would have done to him.

11:36.629 --> 11:37.864
True that.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.799
Hey, listen, Tani.

11:39.799 --> 11:42.435
Um, I want
to thank you for...

11:42.435 --> 11:44.737
helping me
get through all this.

11:44.737 --> 11:47.173
And for believing in me,

11:47.173 --> 11:49.309
even when it looked like
maybe you shouldn’t.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.845
Yeah, well...

11:52.845 --> 11:54.981
after everything
you did for Koa...

11:54.981 --> 11:57.584
it was the least
I could do.

12:01.821 --> 12:02.956
Oh. Hey.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.824
JERRY:
McGarrett asked me
to meet you here.

12:04.824 --> 12:06.292
Thought you might need
my nerd-fu.

12:06.292 --> 12:07.894
Your nerd-fu’s
always welcome.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.862
Hi. You can let us in now.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.971
♪ ♪

12:17.971 --> 12:19.839
Wow.

12:19.839 --> 12:22.875
Either Gene Wahale was
a total slob, or...

12:22.875 --> 12:24.978
Someone was in here
looking for something.

12:24.978 --> 12:27.480
I’m gonna check out
the back.

12:57.243 --> 13:00.346
Boy, that must be one
of the last pictures
Gene had with his parents.

13:00.346 --> 13:02.382
They were killed in a
home invasion robbery

13:02.382 --> 13:03.650
when he was ten.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.618
Orphaned kid goes on
to fight crime.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.021
That’s a classic
superhero origin story.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.023
Except whoever
tossed this place

13:10.023 --> 13:11.524
wasn’t interested
in sentimental value.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.760
Or actual value.
They left behind

13:13.760 --> 13:14.894
a first edition
Martian Chronicles.

13:14.894 --> 13:16.429
That’s got to be worth
a pretty penny.

13:16.429 --> 13:19.932
I also noticed an Xbox, some
cash and a statue of Ultraman.

13:19.932 --> 13:21.868
That’s got to be
worth a few hundred.
You know Ultraman?

13:21.868 --> 13:24.003
(chuckles): Yeah.
Every kid in Japan

13:24.003 --> 13:26.339
grew up wanting
to be Ultraman.

13:26.339 --> 13:29.242
Susumu Kurobe was
my Christopher Reeve.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.443
Cool.

13:30.443 --> 13:33.179
So our intruder wasn’t looking
for an actual payday.

13:33.179 --> 13:35.181
They must have been looking
for something specific.

13:35.181 --> 13:37.483
TANI:
Guys, you want to come in here?

13:37.483 --> 13:39.752
What did you find?

13:39.752 --> 13:42.755
I got wires and plugs,

13:42.755 --> 13:44.957
but no computer or hard drive.

13:44.957 --> 13:46.426
Must be what was taken.

13:46.426 --> 13:49.529
Yeah, and I have
an idea why.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.230
So, if what this guy
put online

13:51.230 --> 13:53.166
was just a fraction
of what he recorded,

13:53.166 --> 13:55.134
then that would mean
that he’s sitting on

13:55.134 --> 13:57.470
hundreds and hundreds of hours
of raw footage.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.372
Wahale spent his time
documenting suspected criminals.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.708
Maybe he caught
something on tape,

14:01.708 --> 14:02.742
possibly without
realizing it,

14:02.742 --> 14:04.777
something that was
a threat to someone.

14:04.777 --> 14:07.113
Yeah, well, here’s the thing.
Gene wasn’t an amateur.

14:07.113 --> 14:08.614
These videos were
his livelihood.

14:08.614 --> 14:10.149
So the drives may be gone,

14:10.149 --> 14:13.686
but I’m willing to bet
he had an online backup.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.189
STEVE:
Hey. I heard we got something.
TANI: We do.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.824
Yeah, thanks to Jerry,
we now have access

14:17.824 --> 14:19.726
to Gene Wahale’s
online data storage.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.394
JERRY:
It’s over three terabytes

14:21.394 --> 14:24.530
of data, but a couple things
stood out immediately.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.865
First up...

14:25.865 --> 14:28.201
Hi.
Hi.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.069
WOMAN:
Hey, stop that.

14:30.069 --> 14:31.404
(man grunts)

14:31.404 --> 14:33.206
Crime’s the problem.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.540
I’m the solution.

14:35.641 --> 14:36.909
WOMAN:
Who are you?
Wow.

14:36.909 --> 14:38.478
I’m the Guardian.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.813
I guard.

14:40.813 --> 14:42.415
Okay, who is
this idiot?

14:42.415 --> 14:47.253
Well, if Night Sentinel’s Oahu’s
original vigilante hero...

14:47.253 --> 14:49.589
Guardian is
the young upstart.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.591
He talked smack about Gene
in his videos.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.626
Someone send a link
to Night Sentinel,

14:53.626 --> 14:55.661
so he can see
how it’s really done.

14:55.661 --> 14:56.729
He was
always trying

14:56.729 --> 14:58.731
to drum up some
kind of rivalry.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.300
So they had a beef?
Well, none of
the real fans

15:01.300 --> 15:02.635
actually took
Guardian seriously.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.036
In fact, even Night
Sentinel pretty much

15:04.036 --> 15:06.038
just ignored him.
Well, he took him
seriously enough

15:06.038 --> 15:08.708
to keep a file on the guy.
Do you really think
that this guy

15:08.708 --> 15:10.309
had something to do
with killing our victim

15:10.309 --> 15:12.411
over who was a better superhero?
No, but there’s

15:12.411 --> 15:14.614
real money at stake here--
both these guys were selling

15:14.614 --> 15:16.482
ad space on their
YouTube channels,

15:16.482 --> 15:18.551
and that’s a solid
stream of revenue,

15:18.551 --> 15:20.620
one that’s based on
clicks and subscribers,

15:20.620 --> 15:22.989
and also, they’re in
competition with each other.

15:22.989 --> 15:25.391
There you go. I mean,
I can’t imagine this island

15:25.391 --> 15:27.360
is big enough
to support more than one

15:27.360 --> 15:29.729
of these hometown heroes.
ADAM:
And then there’s this.

15:29.729 --> 15:32.365
It’s a recording of a
threatening voice mail

15:32.365 --> 15:34.267
our victim received.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.302
(distorted):
You’re not getting the message.

15:36.302 --> 15:39.138
Drop your investigation
or pay the price.

15:39.138 --> 15:41.040
It sounds like
my ex-mother-in-law.

15:41.040 --> 15:41.974
It sounds like a threat.

15:41.974 --> 15:43.342
Can we unscramble that?

15:43.342 --> 15:44.977
Crime lab’s working on it
right now,

15:44.977 --> 15:46.379
but with digital
voice distortion,

15:46.379 --> 15:48.247
it’s gonna be difficult.

15:48.247 --> 15:51.150
Okay, let’s just say that
the Guardian left that message.

15:51.150 --> 15:53.386
Uh, I think what
we need to focus on

15:53.386 --> 15:56.189
is what was it that he didn’t
want the other guy to find out.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.624
I think I may have an idea.
How do we find this guy?

15:58.624 --> 16:00.560
DANNY:
I-I get...

16:00.560 --> 16:02.261
wanting to make
a difference, okay?

16:02.261 --> 16:03.629
That’s why I became a cop.

16:03.629 --> 16:06.199
But you got to be
a real specific kind of psycho

16:06.199 --> 16:08.334
to want to put on, you know,
tights and fight crime.

16:08.334 --> 16:10.469
There’s got to be
something wrong with you.
I don’t know.

16:10.469 --> 16:11.938
You don’t know?
Well, I mean,
I kind of get

16:11.938 --> 16:14.607
the appeal-- I mean, who didn’t
grow up wanting to be Batman?

16:14.607 --> 16:15.808
You know
what I mean?

16:15.808 --> 16:18.177
I-I didn’t want to be Batman.

16:18.177 --> 16:20.479
Or Robin, whatever.

16:20.479 --> 16:21.781
Didn’t-didn’t want to be Robin.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.516
I’m sure you’d like that.
But no.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.985
Maybe Superman, right?
’Cause he could, you know...

16:25.985 --> 16:27.386
he could fly,

16:27.386 --> 16:30.356
and he was bulletproof,
shoot lasers out of his eye.

16:30.356 --> 16:33.392
Batman was just...
Batman was just a guy.
Exactly.

16:33.392 --> 16:35.428
Batman’s just a guy--
he wasn’t born
with superpowers.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.797
That guy had to train hard.

16:37.797 --> 16:40.967
He had to put in years
of work and time and
get himself to that...

16:40.967 --> 16:43.102
you know, that absolute peak
of human conditioning

16:43.102 --> 16:44.837
so he could save the world.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.273
I mean, he just inherited money.
What’d he really do?

16:47.273 --> 16:49.075
Inherit money and bought
a bunch of Batmobiles.

16:49.075 --> 16:50.743
But he’s not very special.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.612
Are you out of your mind?
Bruce Wayne’s parents

16:52.612 --> 16:54.981
were killed right in front
him when he was a kid.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.315
You’re giving him grief
for that?

16:56.315 --> 16:58.451
No, I’m not, ’cause he’s
not even a real person.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.119
Okay? All right,
when I was a child,

17:00.119 --> 17:01.787
I liked superheroes, right?
Then I grew up,

17:01.787 --> 17:04.690
and I decided I wanted
to do other things, like, uh,

17:04.690 --> 17:06.225
meet girls and move out
of my parents’ basement.

17:06.225 --> 17:08.427
I adjusted to life
as an adult human,

17:08.427 --> 17:10.930
like most people...
normal people do.

17:10.930 --> 17:12.732
You understand?
I just figured it out.
I just figured out

17:12.732 --> 17:14.533
what your superpower is.
What’d you figure out?
Really?

17:14.533 --> 17:16.369
You can irritate
people to death.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.371
Is that it? Okay. All right.
Keep going, see what happens.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.106
I think it’s
right up here.

17:20.106 --> 17:22.074
Just got a tip
about a robbery in progress,

17:22.074 --> 17:23.743
(whispers):
and it was dead-on.

17:23.743 --> 17:26.145
Looks like I beat the cops here.

17:26.145 --> 17:27.647
Per usual.

17:27.647 --> 17:30.049
But that’s cool, ’cause
where the Guardian walks...

17:30.049 --> 17:32.084
he walks alone.
MAN:
Freeze!

17:32.084 --> 17:33.119
Everybody get down!

17:33.119 --> 17:34.120
(woman screams)

17:34.120 --> 17:36.289
WOMAN:
Call the cops!

17:36.289 --> 17:38.691
(grunting)

17:38.691 --> 17:41.527

17:47.366 --> 17:49.435
STEVE: Five-O!
We’re experiencing
some technical difficulties.

17:49.435 --> 17:51.637
Put it down.
I’m gonna fix it ASAP.
Thanks. Bye.

17:51.637 --> 17:53.306
Put it down.
Don’t shoot.
Don’t shoot.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.541
The gun isn’t real.
None of it is.

17:55.541 --> 17:57.843
Turn that off.

17:57.843 --> 17:59.612
Turn it off.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.519
Can I give you

18:06.519 --> 18:08.020
some constructive criticism?

18:08.020 --> 18:11.524
Maybe don’t cast
the same actor

18:11.524 --> 18:13.626
in every video you make.
I’m just saying

18:13.626 --> 18:15.094
for the sake
of authenticity, okay?

18:15.094 --> 18:17.263
DANNY: Yeah,
I mean, I seen you

18:17.263 --> 18:19.865
a month ago-- you were
about to jump off a bridge,

18:19.865 --> 18:21.901
and then, before that,
you were getting mugged,

18:21.901 --> 18:23.636
and now you’re robbing
a liquor store.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.972
I mean, the range,
I admire your range.
Very good.

18:25.972 --> 18:27.573
Thank you.

18:27.573 --> 18:30.376
Look, I-I can explain
everything.

18:30.376 --> 18:32.712
Go ahead. Please.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.051
♪ ♪

18:43.689 --> 18:45.891
That seems super excessive.

a week before he turns up dead.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.176
Wait. Wait. What?
He found out

19:37.176 --> 19:39.712
you were faking your busts.
He was gonna expose you,

19:39.712 --> 19:43.082
so you tried to scare him
into backing off.

19:43.082 --> 19:45.484
When that didn’t work, you
were left with one option:

19:45.484 --> 19:48.454
kill Night Sentinel
and destroy the evidence.

didn’t kill anybody, man.

19:59.231 --> 20:01.300
Would you like us
to play a highlight reel

20:01.300 --> 20:03.736
of you talking smack
about Wahale?

20:03.736 --> 20:05.738
The YouTube videos? Oh, please.

20:11.410 --> 20:13.312

You create a beef

20:13.312 --> 20:16.248
and you generate some heat
and i-it’s good for everybody.

20:16.248 --> 20:18.584
Night Sentinel didn’t think so.

20:18.584 --> 20:20.086

Yeah. I mean, no kidding.

20:20.086 --> 20:21.887

way too seriously.

kind of psycho

throws down

20:24.957 --> 20:27.326
Real heroes take down
real criminals!

20:27.326 --> 20:28.928
That only sounds
crazy to you

20:28.928 --> 20:30.329
’cause you’re a coward.

20:30.329 --> 20:32.665
I prefer "risk-averse."

20:32.665 --> 20:33.999
You’re a fraud.

20:33.999 --> 20:36.669
And if Night Sentinel
went public with your scam,

20:36.669 --> 20:39.939
you would lose your reputation,
your fans, your entire income.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.647
He was the one that was
having money problems.

20:48.647 --> 20:50.916
STEVE:
Oh.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.918
What are you talking about?

20:52.918 --> 20:55.221
I heard that the Night Sentinel

20:55.221 --> 20:57.223
was liquidating
his comic book collection.

20:57.223 --> 20:59.391
Okay? So, for a
guy like him...

20:59.391 --> 21:01.560
(chuckles)
...uh, to do that,

21:01.560 --> 21:04.296
he had to be desperate for cash.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.137
I got to say, Jerry, for
your first crack at rendition,

21:11.137 --> 21:12.304
you nailed it.

21:12.304 --> 21:13.772
You’re a natural, buddy.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.374
Yeah? How was my bad cop?

21:15.374 --> 21:17.243
Unbelievable. You were
born to play that part.

21:17.243 --> 21:18.711
(laughs)

21:18.711 --> 21:21.580
All right, so we go through
the vic’s insurance policy.

21:21.580 --> 21:25.985
Therein is contained a comic
book collection worth 30 grand.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.787
$30,000 for...
Yes.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.955
And, uh, there was no evidence
of a collection that size

21:29.955 --> 21:33.092
at his place, so we think
he probably unloaded it.

21:33.092 --> 21:35.628
Must have taken a while to put
it together. Why sell it now?

21:35.628 --> 21:37.696
Yeah, that’s a good question.
And as far as we can tell,

21:37.696 --> 21:39.899
there wasn’t any history of,
you know,

21:39.899 --> 21:42.067
major debt or financial issues.

21:42.067 --> 21:43.736
Okay. Y-You don’t think
it’s a little strange

21:43.736 --> 21:46.839
this man would sell his $30,000
comic book collection

21:46.839 --> 21:49.375
so close to the time
of his murder?

21:49.375 --> 21:52.378
Sir, uh, HPD got
a hit on your BOLO.

21:52.378 --> 21:54.513
The car that hit our victim
was found abandoned

21:54.513 --> 21:56.215
at Waianae Kai
Forest Reserve.

21:56.215 --> 21:57.683
Turns out it was stolen
from long-term parking

21:57.683 --> 21:59.251
at the airport.

21:59.251 --> 22:00.386
CSU’s processing as we speak,

22:00.386 --> 22:01.921
but it looks like
it was wiped clean.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.189
Bye-bye, prints;

22:03.189 --> 22:04.623
bye-bye, DNA.
Yeah.

22:04.623 --> 22:06.692
This is where we found
the killer’s vehicle.

22:06.692 --> 22:08.694
It’s a pretty remote area.

22:08.694 --> 22:10.162
Well, I doubt our perp
walked back from there.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.931
Maybe he had an accomplice
to come pick him up.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.933
STEVE: Or he called
a car service.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.334
Adam, do me a favor.
Reach out to all

22:15.334 --> 22:16.969
ride-share and taxi companies,

22:16.969 --> 22:18.704
see if anybody picked up
a fare nearby.

22:18.704 --> 22:20.105
You got it.
In the meantime,

22:20.105 --> 22:21.440
we need to figure out
why our vic sold

22:21.440 --> 22:22.441
his comic book collection.

22:22.441 --> 22:24.276
TANI:
Good place to start could be

22:24.276 --> 22:25.477
finding out who bought it.

22:25.477 --> 22:29.381
There are seven comic book
stores on this island.

22:29.381 --> 22:31.116
You know how I know that?

22:31.116 --> 22:34.186
Because I’ve driven my son
to every damn one of ’em.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.055
JERRY: Right, but
there’s only one place

22:36.055 --> 22:38.691
that’s willing to pay fair
value for top-tier titles.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.125
Other Realms.

22:40.125 --> 22:41.894
Yeah, I’m no stranger
to that place.

22:41.894 --> 22:43.262
I’ve dropped a ton
of cash in there.

22:43.262 --> 22:44.897
Okay, well, you’re gonna go back
and pay ’em a visit today.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.465
Take Jerry with, please.

22:46.465 --> 22:48.934
All right, Scary Jerry.

22:51.237 --> 22:52.571
JERRY:
So, Will’s a collector, huh?

22:52.571 --> 22:54.440
Yeah, he is.

22:54.440 --> 22:58.377
Got boxes upon boxes
upon boxes of those things.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.945
And the whole works, too;

22:59.945 --> 23:01.780
the cellophane wrappers,
the cardboard.

23:01.780 --> 23:05.885
He’s even got an app
to keep track of

23:05.885 --> 23:07.419
all his inventory and
whatever he does with it.

23:07.419 --> 23:08.887
Personally, I don’t get it.

23:08.887 --> 23:10.656
Comics are modern mythology.

23:10.656 --> 23:13.058
You know, stories about heroes
and demigods

23:13.058 --> 23:14.493
that inspire us
to do great things.

23:14.493 --> 23:16.061
Well, the only thing
it’s inspiring

23:16.061 --> 23:19.098
my son to do is take up
all the space in my garage

23:19.098 --> 23:20.399
and spend all my money.

23:20.399 --> 23:23.636
You know, when I was a kid,
you read your comic.

23:23.636 --> 23:24.937
When you get finished
with your comic,

23:24.937 --> 23:26.772
you give it to one of your
friends, or you trade it

23:26.772 --> 23:29.508
with one of your friends,
you know.

23:29.508 --> 23:31.277
But I tell you what,
I wish I would have

23:31.277 --> 23:32.444
saved some of them things.

23:32.444 --> 23:34.313
They got to be worth
a fortune now.

23:34.313 --> 23:36.815
So you read comics, too.

23:36.815 --> 23:38.984
Oh, yeah.

23:38.984 --> 23:41.186
You ever wish you were
a superhero?
All the time.

23:41.186 --> 23:42.588
Walter Payton.

23:42.588 --> 23:45.224
That wasn’t a superhero.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.928
I saw the man play.

23:49.928 --> 23:51.530
Superhuman.

23:51.530 --> 23:55.367
What about you?
Who’d you want to be?

23:55.367 --> 23:56.635
Batgirl.

24:00.072 --> 24:01.974
You want to elaborate on that?

24:01.974 --> 24:04.610
When she debuted in the ’60s,
Batgirl had to fight

24:04.610 --> 24:06.979
to be accepted by Batman
and Robin.

24:06.979 --> 24:09.581
I mean, she was just as
capable as they were,

24:09.581 --> 24:10.582
but they didn’t
take her seriously

24:10.582 --> 24:12.251
’cause she didn’t look like them

24:12.251 --> 24:14.853
or do things the same way
as they did.

24:14.853 --> 24:16.555
But she proved she was
just as good and became a highly

24:16.555 --> 24:18.390
valued member of the team.

24:18.390 --> 24:19.925
She’d trust them,
they’d trust her,

24:19.925 --> 24:22.962
and they were stronger
because of it.

24:22.962 --> 24:26.899
That’s a good story.
Batgirl, huh?

24:28.701 --> 24:31.971
(both chuckling)

24:31.971 --> 24:33.906
(door chimes)

24:33.906 --> 24:37.910
(Star Trek theme song playing)

24:37.910 --> 24:39.878
Jeremiah.

24:39.878 --> 24:42.548
How goes it?
Hey, Sharon.

24:42.548 --> 24:45.117
Jeremiah?

24:45.117 --> 24:46.885
It’s a comic reference.
Oh.

24:46.885 --> 24:50.956
Jeremiah is a Franco-Belgian
sci-fi title from the ’70s.

24:50.956 --> 24:53.392
There’s also Jeremiah Arkham,

24:53.392 --> 24:55.394
the director of Arkham
Asylum from the DC Universe.

24:55.394 --> 24:56.729
But that one’s so obvious.

24:56.729 --> 24:59.498
Yeah, I was just about to say
it was obvious.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.401
I think you’re really gonna like
this week’s batch, Jer.

25:02.401 --> 25:05.471
It’s a nice balance
between indie and mainstream.

25:05.471 --> 25:06.805
Hey, you look familiar.

25:06.805 --> 25:08.841
You’ve been in here
before, right?

25:08.841 --> 25:11.276
Oh, yeah, with my son Will.

25:11.276 --> 25:14.847
He’s obsessed with
Green Lantern and Black Widow.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.649
Although for very
different reasons.

25:17.649 --> 25:19.952
(chuckles)
I’m Lou Grover.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.687
I work with Jeremiah.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.856
Mm-hmm.
Actually, Sharon,

25:23.856 --> 25:27.092
Captain Grover and I are
here on business.

25:27.092 --> 25:29.828
We’re looking into the
murder of Gene Wahale,

25:29.828 --> 25:31.764
the Night Sentinel.

25:34.433 --> 25:35.834
I can’t believe it.

25:35.834 --> 25:38.170
So I take it you knew him.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.905
Oh, yeah, I mean,
Gene’s been a regular

25:39.905 --> 25:41.940
for as long as
I can remember.

25:41.940 --> 25:45.878
He’s my only customer who was
a bona fide superhero.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.379
I always worried
something like this

25:47.379 --> 25:50.315
might happen to him.

25:50.315 --> 25:52.017
JERRY: We learned that
Gene recently

25:52.017 --> 25:54.486
sold off his comic collection.

25:54.486 --> 25:56.455
Did you happen to buy
any titles off him?

25:56.455 --> 25:59.124
Yeah. All of them.

25:59.124 --> 26:01.293
He liquidated the entire thing.

26:01.293 --> 26:02.661
GROVER: He must have
needed the money

26:02.661 --> 26:05.464
pretty badly; do you
have any idea why?

26:05.464 --> 26:08.033
As a matter of fact, I do.

26:08.033 --> 26:09.668
Gentlemen,

26:09.668 --> 26:11.904
I present to you
issue number one

26:11.904 --> 26:13.806
of The Mysterious
Night Sentinel.

26:17.943 --> 26:20.112
JERRY:
Whoa. Awesome.

26:20.112 --> 26:21.547
I can’t believe
The Night Sentinel wrote

26:21.547 --> 26:22.815
an actual comic about himself.

26:25.617 --> 26:28.353
GROVER: Wait a second, he spent
all that money on this book?

26:28.353 --> 26:31.457
Yeah, this and three
subsequent issues.

26:31.457 --> 26:33.325
I run a small press
out of my shop,

26:33.325 --> 26:36.495
and I was happy
to cut Gene a deal.

26:36.495 --> 26:37.963
But between the artist
and the inker

26:37.963 --> 26:40.032
and the lettering
and printing costs,

26:40.032 --> 26:42.301
it required a big
outlay of cash.

26:42.301 --> 26:44.837
So, he wasn’t in any trouble?

26:44.837 --> 26:47.206
Not that I know of.

26:47.206 --> 26:50.542
He was just determined
to tell this story.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.010
It’s tragic he’ll
never see it finished.

26:52.010 --> 26:55.481
I just printed the mock-up
this morning.

26:55.481 --> 26:57.382
Well, so much for
the smoking gun.

26:57.382 --> 26:58.884
Hold on.

26:58.884 --> 27:03.789
There’s a proud tradition of
comics based on creators’ lives.

27:03.789 --> 27:05.491
This is highly stylized,
but it’s clearly

27:05.491 --> 27:07.326
based on Gene’s life.

27:07.326 --> 27:09.595
So it could help us figure out
why he was killed.

27:09.595 --> 27:11.463
GROVER:
All right, well,

27:11.463 --> 27:13.966
we’re gonna need
all your materials on this.

27:13.966 --> 27:16.468
Sure. He was partway
through issue four.

27:16.468 --> 27:19.071
I’ll put the digital files
on a zip drive for you.

27:19.071 --> 27:20.506
Jerry.

27:20.506 --> 27:21.840
Oh, and you can go ahead

27:21.840 --> 27:25.043
and ring me up for those
comics while you’re at it.

27:27.813 --> 27:30.249
Really?
What?

27:33.018 --> 27:35.087
JERRY: So, I read through
the Night Sentinel comics.

27:35.087 --> 27:37.389
Definitely a lot of overlap
with real life.

27:37.389 --> 27:40.158
For starters,
the main character witnesses

27:40.158 --> 27:41.994
his parents’ murder during
a home invasion robbery,

27:41.994 --> 27:43.295
just like Gene.

27:43.295 --> 27:46.932
Wow. Right down to the poses
in the crime scene photos.

27:46.932 --> 27:48.367
GROVER: And they both
put on costumes

27:48.367 --> 27:50.569
and go out and
beat people up.

27:50.569 --> 27:52.271
Okay, but here’s
the interesting part.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.573
In the comic, our hero believes

27:54.573 --> 27:56.909
that his reporter dad was killed
to cover up a conspiracy

27:56.909 --> 27:58.944
he was investigating.

27:58.944 --> 28:01.280
And this is Gene’s father,
Trevor Wahale.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.215
STEVE:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:03.215 --> 28:05.117
Hold up.
I remember this guy.

28:05.117 --> 28:07.953
I remember he was, uh,
an investigative reporter

28:07.953 --> 28:09.788
for Channel Ten, I think,
when I was a kid, right?

28:09.788 --> 28:12.357
He used to expose all
kinds of shady stuff.

28:12.357 --> 28:14.026
Tell me something,
did HPD ever look into

28:14.026 --> 28:15.861
any old grudges people may have
had against Trevor Wahale?

28:15.861 --> 28:17.863
GROVER: Well,
I looked into it,

28:17.863 --> 28:19.298
and according to
the police report,

28:19.298 --> 28:21.767
there’s no indication
that Trevor Wahale’s murder

28:21.767 --> 28:24.303
has anything to do with anything
except a robbery gone bad.

28:24.303 --> 28:25.637
STEVE:
Okay, so,

28:25.637 --> 28:27.172
either the conspiracy
part of the comic book

28:27.172 --> 28:28.473
was pure fiction,

28:28.473 --> 28:30.709
or there was more to the
parents’ death than it seemed.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.411
Maybe that’s what that
threatening phone call

28:32.411 --> 28:33.512
was about.

28:33.512 --> 28:34.913
Maybe someone was
calling Gene to warn him

28:34.913 --> 28:36.982
to stop looking into
how his father died.

28:36.982 --> 28:38.617
GROVER: If he was looking
into it at all.

28:38.617 --> 28:41.286
I mean, if he was researching
his father’s death,

28:41.286 --> 28:43.155
we found no evidence of it
in his apartment

28:43.155 --> 28:45.557
or on his cloud storage.
Hold on a second.

28:45.557 --> 28:48.327
In the comic, the hero’s got
a sanctum sanctorum.

28:48.327 --> 28:49.995
Jerry, English?
A hidden room.

28:49.995 --> 28:54.633
Like-like the Batcave.
Okay, there. See?

28:54.633 --> 28:56.868
Night Sentinel pulls a copy
of Homer’s Iliad from the shelf,

28:56.868 --> 28:58.337
and a hidden door
swings open,

28:58.337 --> 29:01.006
revealing this sweet,
tricked out lair.

29:01.006 --> 29:03.642
And I’m certain I saw a copy
of The Iliad

29:03.642 --> 29:05.110
on Gene Wahale’s bookshelf.

29:05.110 --> 29:07.980
Okay. All right,
why don’t you guys go

29:07.980 --> 29:09.147
hit that apartment,
check it out.

29:16.521 --> 29:20.158
Here it goes.
Moment of truth.

29:23.095 --> 29:26.064
Hmm.

29:26.064 --> 29:29.067
Mm. I guess life doesn’t
always imitate art.

29:29.067 --> 29:30.669
Maybe not exactly.

29:30.669 --> 29:32.404
Joons, give me a hand
with this, would you, please?

29:32.404 --> 29:33.872
We’re gonna go this way.

29:33.872 --> 29:37.409
All right.
Here we go.

29:41.079 --> 29:44.349
Well done, Jerry.
(sighs)

29:51.657 --> 29:55.761
I’m guessing we found
what Wahale was investigating.

29:57.729 --> 30:00.132
Yeah, whoever tossed the place,

30:00.132 --> 30:02.768
this is exactly what
they were looking for.

30:02.768 --> 30:06.972
I got a box of VHS tapes
from Trevor Wahale’s TV station.

30:06.972 --> 30:09.541
I got freedom of information
requests, HPD reports.

30:09.541 --> 30:12.778
Some of these things go back
20 years, some are recent.

30:12.778 --> 30:14.846
It looks like Gene was picking
up his father’s investigation

30:14.846 --> 30:16.782
right where it left off, looking
into the same conspiracy.

30:16.782 --> 30:19.284
Yeah.

30:19.284 --> 30:21.787
And that conspiracy
got ’em both killed.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.759
We’ve since contacted the
prosecuting attorney’s office,

30:27.759 --> 30:31.296
who told us they will be opening
an official investigation

30:31.296 --> 30:33.899
into the abuse at the
Golden Days Nursing Home.

30:33.899 --> 30:37.002
For KAHU on your side,
I’m Trevor Wahale.

30:37.002 --> 30:40.172
All right, there are tapes
and tapes of this stuff.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.507
These hard-hitting segments
exposing anything from

30:42.507 --> 30:44.142
shady auto mechanics

30:44.142 --> 30:46.278
to restaurant health code
violations.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.280
It’s kind of poetic,
if you think about it.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.549
In a way, Gene was taking up
his father’s cause.

30:50.549 --> 30:52.551
Exactly. They’re both
crusaders for justice.

30:52.551 --> 30:55.120
It’s like Golden Age
and Silver Age Green Lanterns.

30:56.488 --> 30:58.190
Just go with it.
JUNIOR: Okay, well,

30:58.190 --> 31:00.425
do we know which one of his
father’s investigative pieces

31:00.425 --> 31:02.160
Gene was looking into
when he was killed?

31:02.160 --> 31:04.496
Actually, we believe we do.

31:04.496 --> 31:08.400
This is retired HPD Captain
Ito Ishikawa.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.035
And this other guy
is Frank Willoughby,

31:10.035 --> 31:12.137
forensics analyst.

31:12.137 --> 31:14.406
Now, according to
Trevor Wahale’s notes,

31:14.406 --> 31:15.841
he was investigating
a conspiracy

31:15.841 --> 31:17.242
involving the two men.

31:17.242 --> 31:19.845
JERRY: Yeah, Wahale believed
that Willoughby and the captain

31:19.845 --> 31:21.513
were working together
falsifying forensic evidence

31:21.513 --> 31:23.415
in a number of criminal cases.

31:23.415 --> 31:25.350
And in doing so,

31:25.350 --> 31:27.686
put a lot of innocent people
in prison.
STEVE: Okay, time out.

31:27.686 --> 31:30.622
I never met Captain Ishikawa,
but my father

31:30.622 --> 31:33.091
used to speak of this man
very, very highly.

31:33.091 --> 31:34.359
He has a rock-solid reputation.

31:34.359 --> 31:37.829
Okay, that may be,
but Gene must have believed

31:37.829 --> 31:39.798
there was something to
his father’s theory

31:39.798 --> 31:42.334
because, based on his notes,
he met with

31:42.334 --> 31:44.269
more than 20 inmates
that were allegedly affected

31:44.269 --> 31:45.403
by the drummed up evidence.

31:45.403 --> 31:47.072
TANI: Yeah, and I
looked into Frank Willoughby.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.975
He died back in the ’90s, but
the guy’s record is spotless.

31:49.975 --> 31:52.611
He even served on the State
Board of Police Forensics.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.880
Any surviving relatives?

31:54.880 --> 31:57.783
Actually, yeah,
he has a daughter, Claire.

31:57.783 --> 31:59.451
She still lives
on the island.

31:59.451 --> 32:01.153
Okay, good, good.

32:01.153 --> 32:02.387
Because before we bring in

32:02.387 --> 32:04.923
a highly respected police
captain for questioning,

32:04.923 --> 32:05.957
let’s talk to
Willoughby’s daughter,

32:05.957 --> 32:07.058
see if she can tell us anything.

32:08.660 --> 32:10.095
CLAIRE:
I was so sorry to hear

32:10.095 --> 32:13.365
what happened to Gene;
it’s terrible.

32:13.365 --> 32:17.035
Claire, how’d you know him?
I-I didn’t.

32:17.035 --> 32:18.870
Not personally.

32:18.870 --> 32:20.505
But a couple of weeks ago,
he e-mailed,

32:20.505 --> 32:22.274
asking if we could meet.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.142
We were supposed to meet
this week for coffee.

32:24.142 --> 32:26.144
Do you know what
he wanted to discuss?

32:28.680 --> 32:30.549
Yes.

32:32.617 --> 32:35.353
Years ago,
shortly before Dad died,

32:35.353 --> 32:37.622
Gene’s father Trevor
came by to interview him.

32:37.622 --> 32:41.326
At that point, Dad’s cancer
was pretty far advanced.

32:41.326 --> 32:44.162
The doctors had only
given him a couple more weeks.

32:46.665 --> 32:49.267
People in that situation,
uh, sometimes

32:49.267 --> 32:51.403
they just want to get things
off of their chest.

32:51.403 --> 32:53.238
You know, um,
clear their conscience.

32:55.774 --> 32:58.476
Trevor Wahale recorded
Dad’s confession.

32:58.476 --> 33:03.415
Uh, something about a-a scheme
to boost conviction rates.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.985
(exhales)

33:06.985 --> 33:08.486
Do you know if your father

33:08.486 --> 33:11.823
implicated anyone else
in his confession?

33:11.823 --> 33:16.428
I don’t know. To be honest,
I never wanted to know.

33:16.428 --> 33:18.763
But Mr. Wahale left
with that tape,

33:18.763 --> 33:21.433
and less than a week later,
he was dead.

33:23.435 --> 33:25.871
JUNIOR:
Well, clearly, that tape’s

33:25.871 --> 33:27.038
what got
our vic’s father killed.

33:27.038 --> 33:28.340
He must have implicated
some powerful men.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.342
All right, so they kill him,

33:30.342 --> 33:34.212
get the tape back
and make it look like a robbery.

33:34.212 --> 33:37.449
If Captain Ishikawa
was involved,

33:37.449 --> 33:39.317
I mean, he would’ve been
in the perfect position

33:39.317 --> 33:41.152
to deflect any scrutiny,
and to make sure

33:41.152 --> 33:44.256
any inconvenient evidence
got swept under the rug.

33:44.256 --> 33:46.458
Case closed. Except, not,
because 20 years later,

33:46.458 --> 33:48.193
Wahale’s son Gene digs
the whole thing up,

33:48.193 --> 33:50.462
and now they got
to take him out, too.

33:50.462 --> 33:54.165
I-I think it’s time we
bring in the captain.

33:54.165 --> 33:56.301
Captain Ishikawa,
we, uh, we really appreciate

33:56.301 --> 33:57.636
you coming in. Thank you.

33:57.636 --> 33:59.804
Uh, I hope you don’t mind,
but my attorney

33:59.804 --> 34:01.907
insisted to be
present for this.

34:01.907 --> 34:04.876
Michael Pope. Mr. Ishikawa
wants to help in any way he can.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.645
But I’d be guilty
of malpractice

34:06.645 --> 34:09.047
if I let him talk
to Five-O without counsel.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.115
Okay, uh, Captain,

34:10.115 --> 34:12.884
we are, uh, currently
investigating

34:12.884 --> 34:15.287
Gene Wahale’s murder. Um, and we
think that there’s a connection

34:15.287 --> 34:18.089
to Trevor Wahale, his father,
from 20 years ago.

34:18.089 --> 34:20.125
I remember the
Wahale case well.

34:20.125 --> 34:22.727
I was the first on
the scene, and, uh,

34:22.727 --> 34:25.730
found the boy hiding
under the bed.

34:30.635 --> 34:35.340
Trauma like that, well, that’s
not something you ever get over.

34:35.340 --> 34:37.509
See, the thing is, Captain,
Gene, uh,

34:37.509 --> 34:39.511
Gene didn’t believe
that robbery was the motive.

34:39.511 --> 34:41.146
I mean, he was convinced
that it was

34:41.146 --> 34:42.847
some kind of
conspiracy,

34:42.847 --> 34:45.016
and I-I don’t bring this up
lightly, sir,

34:45.016 --> 34:48.353
but he seemed to think
that you were involved somehow.

34:48.353 --> 34:49.988
POPE: We’re aware
of these allegations.

34:49.988 --> 34:51.990
They’re completely
baseless.

34:51.990 --> 34:54.726
Uh, it’s okay, Michael.
Um, look, uh,

34:54.726 --> 34:56.227
Gene never got over
what happened.

34:56.227 --> 34:58.096
And, uh, naturally,
as he got older,

34:58.096 --> 35:00.598
he started looking for someone
to blame, so he started

35:00.598 --> 35:02.334
making wild
accusations.

35:02.334 --> 35:05.537
I just chalked it up to him
trying to make sense of it all.

35:05.537 --> 35:06.972
POPE:
Uh, gentlemen,

35:06.972 --> 35:08.473
I don’t mean
to denigrate the dead,

35:08.473 --> 35:10.942
but we’re talking about a man
who dressed up as a superhero

35:10.942 --> 35:13.511
and confronted
dangerous criminals.

35:13.511 --> 35:15.947
Captain Ishikawa,
on the other hand,

35:15.947 --> 35:18.183
I’ve personally known
for many years,

35:18.183 --> 35:21.086
and his career and character
are beyond reproach.

35:21.086 --> 35:23.755
So unless
there’s something else...

35:23.755 --> 35:27.058
Uh, (clears throat)
look, I-I know the job.

35:27.058 --> 35:29.894
All right? As captain,
you’re under a lot of pressure,

35:29.894 --> 35:32.831
all right, to, uh, to figure out
what’s going on,

35:32.831 --> 35:34.165
uh, close
a lot of cases...

35:34.165 --> 35:36.134
Exactly what are you suggesting?

35:36.134 --> 35:37.669
STEVE:
We have uncovered

35:37.669 --> 35:40.138
information indicating
that in the ’90s,

35:40.138 --> 35:42.507
forensic expert Frank Willoughby

35:42.507 --> 35:46.344
was falsifying evidence in order
to boost conviction rates.

35:46.344 --> 35:47.712
DANNY: Which happened
on your watch.

35:47.712 --> 35:48.980
POPE: Do you have
any evidence

35:48.980 --> 35:50.215
connecting my client

35:50.215 --> 35:51.616
to this alleged scheme?

35:51.616 --> 35:54.052
Because unless you’re charging
him with something,

35:54.052 --> 35:55.253
I’m concluding
this interview.

35:55.253 --> 35:56.621
Now.

35:59.090 --> 36:01.359
I’m sorry, Commander.

36:01.359 --> 36:04.529
Please be advised, any further
discussions with Mr. Ishikawa

36:04.529 --> 36:06.865
will take place in a
more formal setting.

36:06.865 --> 36:09.968
No more fishing expeditions.

36:12.037 --> 36:15.640
(elevator chimes)

36:15.640 --> 36:16.975
Well, that went well.

36:16.975 --> 36:18.176
Yeah.
Next time I get divorced,

36:18.176 --> 36:19.477
I want that guy
to represent me.

36:19.477 --> 36:21.046
Hey, I got something.

36:21.046 --> 36:22.947
I tracked down a taxi service
that picked up a fare

36:22.947 --> 36:24.182
early this morning, right near

36:24.182 --> 36:25.350
where our killer’s car
was ditched.

36:25.350 --> 36:26.685
Well, the driver get a name?

36:26.685 --> 36:28.553
No. And the passenger paid
cash, but he was dropped off

36:28.553 --> 36:31.122
at the Kapuloha Garden
Apartments in Waikiki.

36:31.122 --> 36:33.191
We’re pulling a list
of residents, seeing if anyone

36:33.191 --> 36:35.260
has a record or any other flags
in the system.

36:35.260 --> 36:37.629
All right,
I got a quicker way.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.500
Hey.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.269
Here’s the headrest
from our stolen vehicle.

36:44.269 --> 36:45.437
(barks)

36:45.437 --> 36:46.771
All right, Eddie, get a scent.

36:46.771 --> 36:48.106
Get a scent. What a good boy.
What a good boy.

36:48.106 --> 36:51.176
Okay, okay. Now find.
Find. Find.

36:51.176 --> 36:52.343
Good boy. Let’s go.

36:52.343 --> 36:53.712
Good boy.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.080
(Eddie panting)

36:56.681 --> 36:58.716
(sniffing)

36:58.716 --> 37:00.051
Okay, okay.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.753
Okay, come on-- good boy.

37:01.753 --> 37:02.987
Good boy.

37:10.962 --> 37:12.897
♪ ♪

37:14.099 --> 37:15.400
(growls softly)

37:34.586 --> 37:36.855
Move in.

37:36.855 --> 37:38.590
Hey! Hey!

37:55.607 --> 37:58.443
We I.D.’d him. His name
is Darrel Wentz, 27.

37:58.443 --> 37:59.978
Multiple felony charges.

37:59.978 --> 38:01.613
JUNIOR: Including
a stint in Halawa

38:01.613 --> 38:02.847
for assault
with a deadly weapon.

38:02.847 --> 38:06.151
27. Wait a minute,
this doesn’t make any sense.

38:06.151 --> 38:08.887
Wentz was a kid when Trevor
Wahale was killed. H-He couldn’t

38:08.887 --> 38:10.889
have had any interest
in an old police conspiracy.

38:10.889 --> 38:12.857
Then he must’ve been
hired by someone who did.

38:12.857 --> 38:15.727
Wentz was a trigger man.

38:15.727 --> 38:17.662
Yeah. He was also our best lead.

38:21.099 --> 38:22.634
So our hired gun’s record shows

38:22.634 --> 38:25.136
a long history of assault.
Most recently,

38:25.136 --> 38:26.804
he pistol-whipped a guy so badly
that he fractured

38:26.804 --> 38:30.842
his orbital bone,
almost blinding him.

38:30.842 --> 38:32.477
All right, this is,
this is less than two years ago,

38:32.477 --> 38:33.645
and he had priors.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.246
Yeah. Why is he not
still in prison, right?

38:35.246 --> 38:37.182
I can answer that question.

38:37.182 --> 38:40.084
I just got off the phone with
my contact at the courthouse

38:40.084 --> 38:43.188
who told me that just last
month, Mr. Wentz here

38:43.188 --> 38:44.189
had his sentence reduced

38:44.189 --> 38:46.024
to time served.

38:46.024 --> 38:47.292
Released years
ahead of schedule.

38:47.292 --> 38:50.295
Seems like his fancy lawyer
made these arrangements,

38:50.295 --> 38:51.629
and it’s the same fancy lawyer

38:51.629 --> 38:54.365
that represents
Captain Ishikawa.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.502
Michael Pope.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.604
What’s an upscale attorney

38:59.604 --> 39:02.640
like Michael Pope doing
representing a two-bit hit man?

39:02.640 --> 39:03.908
Hmm...

39:06.978 --> 39:09.581
STEVE: Ah, you see, Gene Wahale
was onto the right conspiracy.

39:09.581 --> 39:11.182
He just had the wrong guy.
DANNY: Yeah,
you were right.

39:11.182 --> 39:14.018
Captain Ishikawa is a,
is a good guy, honest guy.

39:14.018 --> 39:16.621
You were the one working
with Willoughby. Not him.

39:16.621 --> 39:18.122
(chuckles):
This is ridiculous.

39:18.122 --> 39:19.857
No, it’s not ridiculous.

39:19.857 --> 39:22.126
You were the prosecuting
attorney on all of those cases.

39:22.126 --> 39:25.029
And you were so keen to make
a big name for yourself,

39:25.029 --> 39:27.298
you didn’t mind padding
your conviction rate.

39:27.298 --> 39:29.634
You did whatever
you had to do, right?

39:29.634 --> 39:31.002
I mean, you put
innocent people

39:31.002 --> 39:32.971
in jail, man.
That’s cold-blooded.

39:32.971 --> 39:35.707
20 years ago, Trevor Wahale was
onto you, so you had him killed.

39:35.707 --> 39:38.877
Then his son Gene comes up,
figures out what’s going on,

39:38.877 --> 39:40.345
so you take care of him, too.

39:40.345 --> 39:42.247
I see you’ve bought
into Wahale’s delusions.

39:42.247 --> 39:43.581
But that’s all they are,

39:43.581 --> 39:46.284
which is why
you can’t prove any of this.

39:46.284 --> 39:48.720
POPE (over recording):
You’re not getting the message.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.722
Drop your investigation
or pay the price.

39:50.722 --> 39:53.358
You see, it’s much easier
to unscramble

39:53.358 --> 39:54.692
a distorted voice message

39:54.692 --> 39:57.795
when you know whose voice
it was in the first place.

39:57.795 --> 40:00.765
And lucky for us, you’re all
over your firm’s website,

40:00.765 --> 40:03.034
talking about
what a genius you are,

40:03.034 --> 40:05.270
how impressive your record is.

40:05.270 --> 40:07.238
A lot less impressive now.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.806
This is the point
where, Michael Pope,

40:08.806 --> 40:10.742
you’re under arrest.

40:14.512 --> 40:18.016
SHARON:
Pope had a head start.

40:18.016 --> 40:21.052
He made it to the elevator
just steps ahead of our heroes.

40:21.052 --> 40:24.322
Pope had planned for this.

40:24.322 --> 40:26.557
On the roof,
a private helicopter

40:26.557 --> 40:28.226
was fueled and ready.

40:29.494 --> 40:31.529
The ’copter took flight.
It was over,

40:31.529 --> 40:33.998
for anyone but McGarrett.

40:33.998 --> 40:35.566
He grabbed the struts,

40:35.566 --> 40:38.169
launched himself
into the cockpit, and...

40:38.169 --> 40:40.538
The helicopter dove
into a death spiral.

40:40.538 --> 40:42.373
But against all odds,
McGarrett brought it

40:42.373 --> 40:45.677
to a pinpoint landing
on the busy downtown street.

40:50.682 --> 40:54.652
"Book ’em, Danno."

40:54.652 --> 40:59.490
So, how much of that
really happened?

40:59.490 --> 41:02.460
Well, I might have taken
a little dramatic license.

41:02.460 --> 41:06.331
The lawyer just gave up
and let Five-O arrest him.

41:06.331 --> 41:08.599
But that didn’t quite give
the story the climactic ending

41:08.599 --> 41:09.767
that it deserved.

41:09.767 --> 41:14.272
Well, I know Gene
would’ve loved this.

41:14.272 --> 41:16.507
He’d appreciate you
finishing his story.

41:17.842 --> 41:19.844
(door chimes)

41:19.844 --> 41:21.145
Hey, man, let me, uh...
Yeah.

41:21.145 --> 41:23.147
Let me do this.

41:23.147 --> 41:24.649
Captain.

41:24.649 --> 41:25.883
Commander.
Hey.

41:25.883 --> 41:27.719
Duke.
Steve.

41:27.719 --> 41:29.587
Listen, Captain,
thank you so much

41:29.587 --> 41:31.089
for your help
with everything, and...

41:31.089 --> 41:33.491
I’m sorry we, uh,
had to drag you through it.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.026
Ah, not at all.

41:35.026 --> 41:37.562
You did the right thing.
And now it’s my turn.

41:37.562 --> 41:39.030
I intend to make sure everyone

41:39.030 --> 41:41.966
Pope wrongly convicted
is exonerated.

41:41.966 --> 41:44.369
LUKELA: HPD’s reopened
all the cases

41:44.369 --> 41:46.070
that Pope and Willoughby
both worked on.

41:46.070 --> 41:47.872
That’s awesome.

41:47.872 --> 41:49.640
Thanks to Trevor
and Gene Wahale,

41:49.640 --> 41:51.642
a lot of people are going
to get their lives back

41:51.642 --> 41:54.312
because of their investigations
and sacrifice.

41:54.312 --> 41:57.815
I just wish they
were here to see it.

41:57.815 --> 42:03.321
Well, I mean, they kind of are.

42:10.561 --> 42:12.397
Pretty cool Dad’s
in a comic book, huh?

42:12.397 --> 42:13.631
Mm-hmm.

42:13.631 --> 42:16.000
Does that mean you
and Uncle Steve are superheroes?

42:16.000 --> 42:18.102
That’s exactly
what it means. Yeah.

42:18.102 --> 42:19.003
Awesome.

42:19.003 --> 42:23.074
Come on, give me that. Yeah.

42:23.074 --> 42:24.542
Hey, brother.

42:24.542 --> 42:27.545
Hey, what’s up
there, Mini D?

42:27.545 --> 42:28.946
What you have there?

42:28.946 --> 42:30.248
I should you ask you
the same question.

42:30.248 --> 42:31.649
I just need to clear
something up here.

42:31.649 --> 42:33.751
I thought you put down
childish things

42:33.751 --> 42:35.453
when you moved out
of your parents’ basement?

42:35.453 --> 42:37.822
Thanks-- yes, I did,
but, uh, he’s the child,

42:37.822 --> 42:39.457
and it’s for him.
It’s not for me.

42:39.457 --> 42:40.825
Oh, I see. Well,
here’s the good news:

42:40.825 --> 42:42.527
you’re not alone. I’m with you.

42:42.527 --> 42:44.495
Look, and all the people over
there, having a read?

42:44.495 --> 42:47.565
DANNY:
Well, uh, you know,

42:47.565 --> 42:49.934
nothing wrong with a little fun
for old time’s sake, right?

42:49.934 --> 42:51.536
No, there’s not.
