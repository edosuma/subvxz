06:18.612 --> 06:20.345
>> She was what?

06:20.347 --> 06:22.581
>> She was a stripper!

06:22.583 --> 06:23.648
>> Yeah.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.584
[laughter]

06:25.586 --> 06:27.953
Why isn't she dancing anymore?

06:27.955 --> 06:29.955
>> She stopped because she wants

06:29.957 --> 06:31.256
to go back to school.

06:31.258 --> 06:32.491
>> Why don't you show us?

06:32.493 --> 06:33.792
>> The two pictures that I have

06:33.794 --> 06:36.428
of her are--this is one.

06:36.430 --> 06:37.729
>> Oh, okay, here we go.

06:37.731 --> 06:38.397
Very pretty.

06:38.399 --> 06:39.531
>> Hello, Bre.

06:39.533 --> 06:42.267
>> Oh, wow.

06:42.269 --> 06:43.268
So you saw those pictures,

06:43.270 --> 06:44.035
and you thought...

06:44.037 --> 06:45.370
>> Like, oh, she's pretty.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.104
>> Oh.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.072
>> Yeah.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.340
>> And that's all you've seen

06:48.342 --> 06:50.509
of her in the last four years?

06:50.511 --> 06:51.276
>> Yeah.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.211
>> It's odd that someone who is

06:53.213 --> 06:55.680
an exhibitionist by profession,

06:55.682 --> 06:57.516
that you only have two pictures.

06:57.518 --> 06:58.350
Don't you think there's

06:58.352 --> 07:00.085
something a little off?

07:00.087 --> 07:01.219
>> It is a little odd

07:01.221 --> 07:02.554
and a little off.

07:02.556 --> 07:03.422
>> You ever feel like she's

07:03.424 --> 07:04.423
not telling you something?

07:04.425 --> 07:06.458
>> I want to say yes, but then

07:06.460 --> 07:08.326
it's like no, because I don't

07:08.328 --> 07:09.594
like being lied to.

07:09.596 --> 07:10.929
I don't ask for nothing else.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.297
Just don't lie to me.

07:12.299 --> 07:14.132
I hope that I'm getting

07:14.134 --> 07:15.200
what I give.

07:15.202 --> 07:16.535
Because I'm being genuine with

07:16.537 --> 07:18.069
you, I expect for you to be

07:18.071 --> 07:20.071
genuine with me 100%.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.107
So hopefully that's the case

07:22.109 --> 07:22.874
that's going on.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.744
If not...

07:25.746 --> 07:27.145
four years of trust

07:27.147 --> 07:28.713
and not getting it back,

07:28.715 --> 07:30.782
that would be really hurtful

07:30.784 --> 07:32.284
to me, because I don't trust

07:32.286 --> 07:34.586
too many people.

07:34.588 --> 07:35.587
>> Even though you met on

07:35.589 --> 07:37.756
an internet dating site,

07:37.758 --> 07:39.858
Bre seems to not have any

07:39.860 --> 07:42.194
profile on any other website.

07:42.196 --> 07:42.861
>> Yeah.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.262
I've asked her, like,

07:44.264 --> 07:45.664
"Request me on Facebook."

07:45.666 --> 07:47.299
She was like, "Okay, no

07:47.301 --> 07:48.500
problem."

07:48.502 --> 07:50.602
In that same time, I've had

07:50.604 --> 07:51.736
a death in my family

07:51.738 --> 07:55.006
that happened, and I just, like,

07:55.008 --> 07:56.441
basically disconnected myself

07:56.443 --> 07:59.845
from the world.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.246
She was like, "Okay, I sent you

08:01.248 --> 08:03.348
a request," so I'm like, "Okay,

08:03.350 --> 08:05.350
whenever I get back online,

08:05.352 --> 08:06.384
I'll look at it."

08:06.386 --> 08:07.619
So when I finally did get back

08:07.621 --> 08:10.789
online, I had, like, 30 or 40

08:10.791 --> 08:11.923
friend requests.

08:11.925 --> 08:12.958
I just accepted them all,

08:12.960 --> 08:13.925
because I didn't know which one

08:13.927 --> 08:14.659
was her.

08:14.661 --> 08:15.527
Like, a lot of people didn't

08:15.529 --> 08:16.728
have their names there.

08:16.730 --> 08:17.896
>> You could be friends with her

08:17.898 --> 08:18.697
and not know it.

08:18.699 --> 08:19.564
>> Yeah.

08:19.566 --> 08:20.265
>> I want to go through

08:20.267 --> 08:21.466
your friends on Facebook.

08:21.468 --> 08:22.133
>> Okay.

08:22.135 --> 08:22.801
>> So write down your

08:22.803 --> 08:23.668
login info.

08:23.670 --> 08:24.436
What you've got is her

08:24.438 --> 08:25.203
current phone number.

08:25.205 --> 08:25.904
>> Mm-hmm.

08:25.906 --> 08:26.705
>> You know her name,

08:26.707 --> 08:28.240
or what you think is her name.

08:28.242 --> 08:29.407
>> I know she has a tattoo

08:29.409 --> 08:30.842
on her leg that says,

08:30.844 --> 08:31.810
"Luscious."

08:31.812 --> 08:32.711
>> It says, "Luscious"?

08:32.712 --> 08:33.378
>> Yeah.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.613
>> So that's not a ton of info,

08:34.615 --> 08:35.313
but it's something

08:35.315 --> 08:36.147
to get started.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.482
I want to help you

08:37.484 --> 08:38.450
go on this trip.

08:38.452 --> 08:39.518
I think you deserve the

08:39.520 --> 08:40.385
experience, no matter

08:40.386 --> 08:41.086
what happens.

08:41.087 --> 08:41.753
>> Okay.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.020
>> I am--fingers crossed--

08:43.023 --> 08:45.023
hoping this works out.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.459
>> All right, let's go make sure

08:47.461 --> 08:49.294
that she is who she says she is.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.295
>> Nice meeting you.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.731
>> Nice to meet you too.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.633
>> What's the deal?

08:54.635 --> 08:56.535
>> She's gonna fall hard if Bre

08:56.537 --> 08:59.004
is not being 100%.

08:59.006 --> 08:59.871
>> It sounds like these two

08:59.873 --> 09:01.072
people really could love

09:01.074 --> 09:01.740
each other.

09:01.742 --> 09:02.507
>> Yeah, it sounds like they

09:02.509 --> 09:04.075
have a true connection.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.611
>> Right, and yet, there is this

09:06.613 --> 09:09.414
very likely element that Bre is

09:09.416 --> 09:10.782
not the girl in those two

09:10.784 --> 09:12.684
pictures that Whitney saw,

09:12.686 --> 09:14.119
and the whole relationship could

09:14.121 --> 09:15.053
come crumbling apart.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.121
>> It could.

09:21.594 --> 09:23.028
>> Come into my suite.

09:23.030 --> 09:23.828
>> Is this what happens when

09:23.830 --> 09:25.163
you're the star of the show?

09:25.165 --> 09:25.964
'Cause I didn't get

09:25.966 --> 09:26.565
a room like this.

09:26.567 --> 09:27.432
>> Didn't get this room, Max?

09:27.434 --> 09:28.066
>> No, whoa.

09:28.068 --> 09:28.767
>> Look at this view.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.135
>> Look at that.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.436
Wow.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.538
I'm taking off my jacket.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.073
Nev, sit your ass down.

09:35.075 --> 09:35.807
>> All right, here we go.

09:35.809 --> 09:36.908
>> Let's get this investigation

09:36.910 --> 09:38.410
under way.

09:38.412 --> 09:39.477
>> All right, so 4 1/2 years

09:39.479 --> 09:41.279
ago, Whitney is looking for

09:41.281 --> 09:42.147
love.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.783
She goes on an LGBT dating

09:44.785 --> 09:45.517
website.

09:45.519 --> 09:46.418
She finds herself talking

09:46.420 --> 09:48.887
to Brenell, AKA Bre.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.388
They exchange phone numbers.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.556
>> They're soul mates.

09:51.558 --> 09:52.624
>> But we've got two people who

09:52.626 --> 09:55.093
are separated by 3,000 miles,

09:55.095 --> 09:56.861
which makes meeting up hard,

09:56.863 --> 09:57.696
not to mention that they both

09:57.698 --> 09:59.097
have difficult financial

09:59.099 --> 09:59.864
situations.

09:59.866 --> 10:02.934
More than that, Bre is tough

10:02.936 --> 10:03.868
to pin down.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.036
She doesn't have any social

10:05.038 --> 10:06.037
media pages.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.372
>> She won't video chat.

10:07.374 --> 10:08.506
They talk, though, so it's

10:08.508 --> 10:10.075
a woman's voice she's hearing.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.309
It's something.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.744
>> Let's start things off

10:12.746 --> 10:14.212
with a phone search.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.146
Here we go.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.815
Searching.

10:16.817 --> 10:17.616
What do we got?

10:17.618 --> 10:19.684
Ah, we got an L.A. phone number,

10:19.686 --> 10:21.152
which is a good start.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.787
>> That's promising.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.856
Oh, it's a VoIP.

10:24.858 --> 10:25.924
>> Like a Google Voice number.

10:25.926 --> 10:26.725
>> Yeah.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.460
>> Bre's always saying that she

10:28.462 --> 10:29.861
doesn't have Wi-Fi or that she's

10:29.863 --> 10:31.496
having problems with her Wi-Fi,

10:31.498 --> 10:32.364
and that's why she can't

10:32.366 --> 10:34.666
go online, and yet, when she's

10:34.668 --> 10:37.502
saying that, she's using Wi-Fi,

10:37.504 --> 10:38.370
because the number she's

10:38.372 --> 10:39.104
currently--

10:39.106 --> 10:39.971
>> Only works on the Wi-Fi.

10:39.973 --> 10:40.772
>> Right.

10:40.774 --> 10:41.606
>> So she's been lying about

10:41.608 --> 10:42.941
not having Wi-Fi.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.476
She's finding excuses not

10:44.478 --> 10:45.810
to video chat, which means she's

10:45.812 --> 10:47.312
not the person in the pictures.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.480
>> It's a possibility.

10:48.482 --> 10:49.514
>> What if you look up

10:49.516 --> 10:50.615
the email?

10:50.617 --> 10:53.218
Brenell [bleep].

10:53.220 --> 10:54.486
>> Okay, so here's

10:54.488 --> 10:56.588
a Brenell Twitter.

10:56.590 --> 10:57.589
Los Angeles.

10:57.591 --> 10:58.390
That's great.

10:58.392 --> 10:59.157
>> She lives where she

10:59.159 --> 11:00.091
says she lives.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.893
This could be her.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.361
>> She's cute.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.095
>> I think Whitney

11:04.097 --> 11:05.230
would still go for her.

11:05.232 --> 11:06.598
>> Here's a YouTube page,

11:06.600 --> 11:08.299
a clip of what looks like her

11:08.301 --> 11:09.200
twerking.

11:09.202 --> 11:10.368
>> She knows how to clap

11:10.370 --> 11:11.369
them thighs.

11:11.371 --> 11:12.504
She said that Bre was

11:12.506 --> 11:14.005
an exotic dancer.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.240
>> She goes by her name.

11:15.242 --> 11:16.708
She lives in California.

11:16.710 --> 11:17.742
She's just not the girl in

11:17.744 --> 11:18.977
the two pictures that she sent.

11:18.979 --> 11:19.644
>> No.

11:19.646 --> 11:20.612
>> What else do we have?

11:20.614 --> 11:21.880
>> Why don't you Google Image

11:21.882 --> 11:23.214
search those pictures

11:23.216 --> 11:25.150
that Whitney gave us.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.152
>> Searching a picture.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.721
No, no hits on that.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.022
All right, here's the other one.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.257
Searching.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.191
>> Oh, we got one.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.292
We got a match.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.260
>> Instagram account.

11:35.262 --> 11:36.461
Kash [bleep].

11:36.463 --> 11:37.195
This is the girl from the

11:37.197 --> 11:37.862
pictures.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.131
>> There's a Facebook account.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.332
>> Whoa.

11:41.334 --> 11:42.934
>> The first thing we see are

11:42.936 --> 11:44.469
the two pictures that have been

11:44.471 --> 11:46.604
sent to Whitney.

11:46.606 --> 11:48.606
>> She seems to be in L.A.

11:48.608 --> 11:49.908
We have two girls that we've

11:49.910 --> 11:51.776
found, one named Brenell

11:51.778 --> 11:53.178
[bleep], who doesn't look like

11:53.180 --> 11:54.612
the girl in the pictures

11:54.614 --> 11:56.881
but lives in L.A.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.450
Then we found the girl in the

11:58.452 --> 11:59.250
pictures...

11:59.252 --> 11:59.918
>> Right.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.653
>> That Whitney gave us.

12:01.655 --> 12:03.088
>> Kash [bleep] seems pretty

12:03.090 --> 12:04.122
legit, because not only does she

12:04.124 --> 12:05.323
have an Instagram, but...

12:05.325 --> 12:06.691
>> There's a Facebook account.

12:06.693 --> 12:07.926
>> There's a Facebook.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.961
>> I'm curious if they know

12:09.963 --> 12:10.628
each other.

12:10.630 --> 12:11.629
>> Why do you think that?

12:11.631 --> 12:12.397
>> Because they live in the

12:12.399 --> 12:14.199
exact same part of California.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.433
>> And so they know each other?

12:15.435 --> 12:16.634
>> If one is using pictures

12:16.636 --> 12:17.602
of the other, then I would

12:17.604 --> 12:18.503
suspect that, like--

12:18.505 --> 12:19.270
It's a big coincidence.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.739
>> True, I guess that's

12:20.741 --> 12:21.806
possible, right.

12:21.808 --> 12:22.540
Maybe they're friends

12:22.542 --> 12:23.208
on Facebook.

12:23.210 --> 12:24.342
>> And she thinks that this girl

12:24.344 --> 12:25.510
is maybe pretty,

12:25.512 --> 12:26.311
or prettier than her.

12:26.313 --> 12:26.978
>> She might even have

12:26.980 --> 12:27.779
a crush on her.

12:27.781 --> 12:28.680
>> Or maybe they're doing this

12:28.682 --> 12:29.848
as a prank?

12:29.850 --> 12:30.615
>> Who knows, right?

12:30.617 --> 12:31.516
>> Who knows?

12:31.518 --> 12:33.017
>> Kash is somehow linked

12:33.019 --> 12:34.919
to all this, because her

12:34.921 --> 12:36.020
pictures are being sent

12:36.022 --> 12:37.021
to Whitney.

12:37.023 --> 12:38.957
So I think we should reach out

12:38.959 --> 12:41.192
to Kash, ask her what she knows

12:41.194 --> 12:42.627
about Brenell, see what we

12:42.629 --> 12:43.862
can find out.

12:43.864 --> 12:49.968
"Hey, Kash, this is Nev
from the MTV show <i> Catfish.</i>

12:49.970 --> 12:51.036
from the MTV show <i> Catfish.</i>

12:51.037 --> 12:52.103
It appears someone might be
using your photos.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.171
using your photos.

12:53.172 --> 12:54.238
We would love to speak with you
to clear this up, thanks."

12:54.241 --> 12:54.690
to clear this up, thanks."

12:54.691 --> 12:55.140
>> Send it.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.574
>> Sent.

12:56.576 --> 12:57.308
We don't have all the

12:57.310 --> 12:57.909
answers yet.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.244
I think Whitney's gonna be upset

12:59.246 --> 13:00.945
when she finds out that the girl

13:00.947 --> 13:02.046
in the pictures is not the girl

13:02.048 --> 13:03.014
she's talking to.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.149
>> We don't know why she's

13:04.151 --> 13:05.517
lying, and that's the one thing

13:05.519 --> 13:07.285
Whitney said: "My only big

13:07.287 --> 13:09.387
deal-breaker is being lied to."

13:09.389 --> 13:10.688
She did say that.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.090
>> Everyone says that.

13:12.092 --> 13:12.957
Let's wait to hear back

13:12.959 --> 13:14.893
from Kash and go from there.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.961
That was good work, dude.

13:22.334 --> 13:24.402
[knock at door]

13:26.338 --> 13:27.438
>> [laughs]

13:27.440 --> 13:28.106
>> Ahh!

13:28.108 --> 13:28.773
>> Aah!

13:28.775 --> 13:29.507
>> [laughs]

13:29.509 --> 13:30.308
Wow, I can't believe that

13:30.310 --> 13:30.875
worked.

13:30.877 --> 13:33.244
That's what this is for.
This is the scare hole.

13:33.246 --> 13:34.696
This is the scare hole.

13:34.697 --> 13:36.147
>> Did you get an email?
Here we go.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.449
Here we go.

13:37.450 --> 13:38.750
>> She wrote back, "Hi, Nev,

13:38.752 --> 13:39.551
I got your message.

13:39.553 --> 13:41.419
Call me when you can."

13:41.421 --> 13:42.220
>> So what are we're gonna

13:42.222 --> 13:42.854
ask her?

13:42.856 --> 13:43.688
>> First of all, we need to ask

13:43.690 --> 13:45.290
her if she's in a relationship

13:45.292 --> 13:46.424
with a girl named Whitney.

13:46.426 --> 13:47.559
>> And if she's not talking

13:47.561 --> 13:49.260
to Whitney, does she know

13:49.262 --> 13:50.261
Brenell?

13:50.263 --> 13:53.264
>> All right, here we go.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.065
>> Hey, good morning,

13:54.067 --> 13:57.502
it's Nev and Max from <i> Catfish.</i>

13:57.504 --> 14:00.205
>> Hey, how's it going?

14:00.207 --> 14:01.773
>> Do you know a girl

14:01.775 --> 14:04.776
named Whitney?

14:04.778 --> 14:05.944
>> The next question we had

14:05.946 --> 14:08.146
for you was, do you know

14:08.148 --> 14:11.015
a young lady named Brenell?

14:11.017 --> 14:15.320
She goes by Bre, but Brenell--

14:15.322 --> 14:16.321
>> Oh, okay.

14:16.323 --> 14:18.056
>> Has anyone online ever been

14:18.058 --> 14:20.959
using your profile picture?

14:28.167 --> 14:30.301
>> What was her explanation?

14:36.475 --> 14:37.809
>> Did Bre ever tell you if she

14:37.811 --> 14:40.278
met anyone using your photos?

14:47.353 --> 14:48.620
>> We were trying to find some,

14:48.622 --> 14:50.488
like, social media pages

14:50.490 --> 14:54.225
for Bre.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.261
>> Lucious B [bleep].

14:56.263 --> 14:57.295
All right, well, look, it was

14:57.297 --> 14:58.463
really nice to meet you.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.832
Thank you for your help.

15:00.834 --> 15:01.566
>> Let's look up her

15:01.568 --> 15:03.368
Facebook page.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.470
Oh, here she is.

15:05.472 --> 15:06.604
Oh, boy.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.072
Here's that picture that we saw.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.240
Ready, remember?

15:09.242 --> 15:09.908
Whoa.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.843
>> Whoa.

15:11.845 --> 15:13.778
>> She was a stripper.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.313
>> There's the "lucious" tattoo.

15:15.315 --> 15:16.648
>> Yeah, this is the girl.

15:16.650 --> 15:17.982
Now we know Brenell's

15:17.984 --> 15:19.150
real Facebook page.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.585
I'm willing to bet...

15:20.587 --> 15:22.053
>> That she's already friends

15:22.055 --> 15:22.921
with Whitney.

15:22.923 --> 15:23.821
>> Let's go to her friends.

15:23.823 --> 15:24.923
Let's just look at her friends.

15:24.925 --> 15:25.757
>> Brenell's friends?

15:25.759 --> 15:26.457
>> Yeah.

15:26.459 --> 15:27.225
>> All right, let's see

15:27.227 --> 15:28.626
who she's following.

15:28.628 --> 15:29.761
>> Oh, oh.

15:29.763 --> 15:30.762
>> Not friends there.

15:30.764 --> 15:31.896
>> They may not be friends

15:31.898 --> 15:34.065
right now, but it's possible

15:34.067 --> 15:35.266
that at one point they may have

15:35.268 --> 15:36.167
sent messages.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.369
Let's log in to Whitney's

15:38.371 --> 15:39.203
Facebook page.

15:39.205 --> 15:40.171
>> So now we're gonna creep

15:40.173 --> 15:40.939
through her messages.

15:40.941 --> 15:41.839
>> Well, we're not gonna creep.

15:41.841 --> 15:42.607
We're just gonna look.

15:42.609 --> 15:43.608
We can search Whitney's

15:43.610 --> 15:44.542
messages, look.

15:44.544 --> 15:45.276
>> We can?

15:45.278 --> 15:47.078
>> Yeah.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.746
Wait a second.

15:48.748 --> 15:50.915
Here's a message between Whitney

15:50.917 --> 15:52.317
and Lucious B [bleep].

15:52.319 --> 15:53.451
>> They've talked.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.420
>> So Lucious said, "Hey, boo,

15:55.422 --> 15:57.021
how is everything going?

15:57.023 --> 15:58.122
Where are you now?"

15:58.124 --> 15:59.123
>> What year is this from?

15:59.125 --> 16:02.226
>> This is 2011.
>> How far does it go?

16:02.228 --> 16:02.810
>> How far does it go?

16:02.811 --> 16:03.393
>> It goes--whoa.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.796
Oh, my god, wow, they talked

16:04.798 --> 16:06.597
a lot.

16:06.599 --> 16:07.498
>> Wait, this is a full

16:07.500 --> 16:09.067
relationship.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.902
Do they know each other?

16:10.904 --> 16:12.670
Look, 2014.
>> Oh, my god.

16:12.672 --> 16:13.021
>> Oh, my god.

16:13.022 --> 16:13.371
>> They were talking

16:13.373 --> 16:14.138
in December.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.373
January 19th.

16:15.375 --> 16:16.674
That was a week ago.

16:16.676 --> 16:17.742
Do you think Whitney

16:17.744 --> 16:19.477
is messing with us?

16:19.479 --> 16:20.545
Is that what's happening

16:20.547 --> 16:21.846
right now?

16:21.848 --> 16:23.614
>> "Hey, luv, get on ooVoo?"

16:23.616 --> 16:24.315
Luv?

16:24.317 --> 16:25.416
>> Wait, get on ooVoo?

16:25.418 --> 16:26.184
I thought she couldn't

16:26.186 --> 16:26.851
get on ooVoo.

16:26.853 --> 16:27.752
>> That doesn't make any sense.

16:27.754 --> 16:28.686
>> It looks like they've been

16:28.688 --> 16:30.254
video chatting since 2011.

16:30.256 --> 16:31.289
>> Do you think Whitney just--

16:31.291 --> 16:33.157
Whitney and Brenell

16:33.159 --> 16:34.492
talk extensively.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.427
They're having an almost daily

16:36.429 --> 16:37.495
exchange for the past

16:37.497 --> 16:40.064
four years.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.933
>> I'm so confused.

16:41.935 --> 16:43.368
Or I'm not.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.969
>> She's lying to us.

16:44.971 --> 16:46.070
She's got to be lying to us.

16:46.072 --> 16:47.405
She's got to know that Lucious

16:47.407 --> 16:48.673
is Brenell [bleep].

16:48.675 --> 16:50.675
They're very good friends.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.077
>> So Whitney is screwing

16:53.079 --> 16:54.112
with us.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.680
She's--she played us.

16:55.682 --> 16:56.914
>> We figured it out.

16:56.916 --> 16:58.649
>> But we're here.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.418
We got catfished.

17:00.420 --> 17:01.619
Whitney--is that even

17:01.621 --> 17:02.820
her real name?

17:02.822 --> 17:03.988
>> We don't even know if

17:03.990 --> 17:05.890
anything she's told us is real.

17:05.892 --> 17:06.758
>> I mean, we don't even know

17:06.760 --> 17:08.059
if they're in love.

17:08.060 --> 17:10.194
>> Did they want to be on TV?

17:10.195 --> 17:11.295
>> Yeah, Lucious...

17:11.297 --> 17:12.262
>> She's got a career maybe

17:12.265 --> 17:13.031
she's trying to pursue.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.531
>> Lucious is no stranger

17:14.534 --> 17:15.933
to the camera.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.734
There have to be easier ways

17:17.737 --> 17:19.002
to meet than to write into

17:19.005 --> 17:20.338
a television show.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.006
They're using us for a plane

17:22.008 --> 17:23.207
ticket.

17:23.209 --> 17:24.075
>> Did she really think we

17:24.077 --> 17:25.510
wouldn't figure it out?

17:25.512 --> 17:28.012
I just can't believe this.

17:28.013 --> 17:29.280
So what do we do?

17:29.282 --> 17:30.081
>> What do you guys think

17:30.083 --> 17:32.150
we should do?

17:44.329 --> 17:45.196
>> And then the episode

17:45.198 --> 17:47.265
just ends?

17:56.809 --> 17:58.843
>> Yeah, let's, like, watch her

17:58.845 --> 18:00.144
squirm a little bit.

18:00.146 --> 18:01.846
If she cops to it and it's

18:01.848 --> 18:02.914
a love story and she just

18:02.916 --> 18:04.148
desperately wants to meet this

18:04.150 --> 18:05.483
person and the show is her only

18:05.485 --> 18:06.684
way to do it, we've got to

18:06.686 --> 18:08.386
double--triple-check that.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.121
>> Let's call Whitney, and let's

18:10.123 --> 18:13.024
just sort of take it one step

18:13.026 --> 18:14.258
at a time.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.694
[line trilling]

18:16.696 --> 18:18.529
>> Hello, Whitney.

18:18.531 --> 18:19.397
>> Good morning.

18:19.399 --> 18:20.264
>> How you feeling?

18:20.266 --> 18:23.167
Are you nervous?

18:23.169 --> 18:25.236
>> What are you nervous about?

18:28.407 --> 18:29.540
>> All right, well, we've been

18:29.542 --> 18:30.808
working last night and

18:30.810 --> 18:31.676
a little bit today.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.744
We got some interesting topics

18:33.746 --> 18:36.080
and things to discuss.

18:36.082 --> 18:37.348
So we were hoping we could come

18:37.350 --> 18:41.919
meet up with you and talk.

18:41.921 --> 18:44.188
>> We'll see you in a bit.

18:44.190 --> 18:46.090
>> Okay.

18:46.092 --> 18:47.291
They did a good job getting us

18:47.293 --> 18:48.192
here, but they didn't do

18:48.194 --> 18:49.026
such a good job--

18:49.028 --> 18:49.861
>> They didn't cover their

18:49.863 --> 18:50.528
tracks.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.262
>> This is definitely

18:51.264 --> 18:52.964
a <i> Catfish</i> first.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.098
>> ♪ Walking down ♪

18:54.100 --> 18:57.001
♪ The hall again ♪

18:57.003 --> 18:58.269
>> What is she gonna say?

18:58.271 --> 19:00.071
What is her excuse gonna be?

19:00.073 --> 19:01.606
>> I'm mostly just torn up

19:01.608 --> 19:03.207
because I liked Whitney so much

19:03.209 --> 19:04.142
when we hung out with her

19:04.144 --> 19:05.877
yesterday, and now it's, like,

19:05.879 --> 19:08.913
actually two people who are just

19:08.915 --> 19:10.448
using us to get something

19:10.450 --> 19:11.883
that they want.

19:11.885 --> 19:12.783
>> We've got an

19:12.785 --> 19:14.852
interrogation on our hands.

19:18.423 --> 19:23.261
We are being played by Whitney.

19:23.263 --> 19:24.595
>> We've already established

19:24.597 --> 19:25.796
that Whitney is capable

19:25.798 --> 19:27.298
of great deceit.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.367
So we have to really question

19:29.369 --> 19:30.735
everything she says.

19:30.737 --> 19:31.469
>> So how are we gonna

19:31.471 --> 19:32.336
play this?

19:32.338 --> 19:33.171
>> I think we're gonna show

19:33.173 --> 19:34.071
Whitney a couple of the things

19:34.073 --> 19:35.439
that we found, and as we're

19:35.441 --> 19:37.942
doing it, see if she has

19:37.944 --> 19:39.243
an answer for it.

19:39.245 --> 19:40.344
>> You ready to do this?

19:40.346 --> 19:41.779
Ready to bust a catfish?

19:41.781 --> 19:42.580
>> I mean, I don't think

19:42.582 --> 19:43.948
we have a choice.

19:43.950 --> 19:46.684
[line trilling]

19:46.686 --> 19:48.019

[door buzzes]

19:51.758 --> 19:57.228
>> Hey.

19:57.230 --> 19:57.895
>> How you doing?

19:57.897 --> 19:59.096
>> I'm good.

19:59.098 --> 20:00.064
I was, like, really,

20:00.066 --> 20:04.101
really nervous.

20:04.103 --> 20:07.071
You guys are like <i> CSI.</i>

20:07.073 --> 20:07.805
I was like, "What did they

20:07.807 --> 20:08.606
find out?

20:08.608 --> 20:10.074
What happened?"

20:10.076 --> 20:10.775
>> Well, what were your

20:10.777 --> 20:11.943
big concerns?

20:11.945 --> 20:13.077
>> Her being who she says

20:13.079 --> 20:15.112
she is, because I expect--

20:15.114 --> 20:16.080
like, I give the truth,

20:16.082 --> 20:17.848
so I expect the truth back.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.350
If you're gonna lie to me,

20:19.352 --> 20:20.751
it's like, "Why?

20:20.753 --> 20:21.986
What's the purpose of you

20:21.988 --> 20:23.054
lying?"

20:23.056 --> 20:25.623
>> Sometimes you lie to put

20:25.625 --> 20:26.624
yourself in a position

20:26.626 --> 20:27.892
to get what you want.

20:27.894 --> 20:28.893
>> You lie about something,

20:28.895 --> 20:29.694
you're gonna have to keep

20:29.696 --> 20:31.262
telling another lie on top of

20:31.264 --> 20:32.530
that one, on top of that one.

20:32.532 --> 20:33.364
It makes no sense, because

20:33.366 --> 20:34.298
at the end of the day,

20:34.300 --> 20:35.600
you're gonna probably even

20:35.602 --> 20:38.169
forget the first lie you told

20:38.171 --> 20:39.804
or forget the last lie

20:39.806 --> 20:41.105
you told, and eventually the

20:41.107 --> 20:42.707
truth is gonna come out anyway.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.842
So why not just save all the

20:44.844 --> 20:46.444
headache and just get it

20:46.446 --> 20:47.778
over with?

20:47.780 --> 20:48.679
>> Well, we did some

20:48.681 --> 20:50.181
investigating, and...

20:50.183 --> 20:51.115
>> I think we probably have more

20:51.117 --> 20:52.116
questions...

20:52.118 --> 20:53.150
>> Yeah.

20:53.152 --> 20:54.151
>> Than anything at this point.

20:54.153 --> 20:57.121
>> Okay.

20:57.123 --> 20:58.656
>> So why don't we go through

20:58.658 --> 20:59.890
what we found?

20:59.892 --> 21:01.692
You can tell us what makes sense

21:01.694 --> 21:03.928
to you and help explain things.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.429
>> Okay.

21:05.431 --> 21:06.831
>> We ran this image.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.266
The most promising lead that it

21:08.268 --> 21:09.634
gave us was for an Instagram

21:09.636 --> 21:11.369
for someone who goes by the name

21:11.371 --> 21:13.304
Kash [bleep].

21:13.306 --> 21:14.872
We found a Facebook page

21:14.874 --> 21:16.674
for Kash.

21:16.676 --> 21:17.875
And lo and behold, the two

21:17.877 --> 21:20.645
pictures that you can see...

21:20.647 --> 21:21.979
>> Are the ones that I have.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.180
>> Are the ones that you have.

21:23.182 --> 21:28.386
>> [sighs]

21:28.388 --> 21:30.388
Um...I would have thought,

21:30.390 --> 21:32.323
personally, like, of all the

21:32.325 --> 21:34.692
people, Brenell would at least

21:34.694 --> 21:35.593
tell me the truth about

21:35.595 --> 21:36.894
everything.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.162
>> We spoke to Kash.

21:38.164 --> 21:40.431
She does know Bre, and she did

21:40.433 --> 21:42.400
know that Bre has a Facebook

21:42.402 --> 21:43.868
account, and she told us the

21:43.870 --> 21:44.735
name of that, and she said,

21:44.737 --> 21:50.074
it's Lucious B [bleep].

21:50.076 --> 21:52.543
This is Bre.

21:52.545 --> 21:53.444
Have you ever seen this

21:53.446 --> 21:54.178
person before?

21:54.180 --> 21:54.945
>> No.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.013
>> And you'd remember a name

21:56.015 --> 21:57.315
like Lucious B, right?

21:57.317 --> 21:59.216
>> Yeah, yeah, like, I remember

21:59.218 --> 22:00.151
the tattoo.

22:00.153 --> 22:01.285
So that is something that

22:01.287 --> 22:02.353
I would remember.

22:02.355 --> 22:03.154
>> If we scroll through

22:03.156 --> 22:05.956
pictures, boom, "lucious."

22:05.958 --> 22:06.991
>> Wow.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.159
>> So then we thought, could it

22:08.161 --> 22:09.160
be that you're actually

22:09.162 --> 22:10.695
friends with Lucious?

22:10.697 --> 22:14.231
>> I don't know this page.

22:14.233 --> 22:15.232
>> You sure?

22:15.234 --> 22:16.667
>> I have, like, over 1,000

22:16.669 --> 22:18.736
friends on my page.

22:18.738 --> 22:20.738
>> We searched Brenell's

22:20.740 --> 22:22.440
friends, and we didn't see

22:22.442 --> 22:23.774
anything, but then we went into

22:23.776 --> 22:25.142
your messages.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.711
If you had messaged with her

22:26.713 --> 22:28.312
at one point, like, maybe she

22:28.314 --> 22:29.313
just said, "Hi," or, "Hey,

22:29.315 --> 22:30.781
what's up," might still be

22:30.783 --> 22:31.549
buried.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.050
>> Right, messages remain,

22:33.052 --> 22:33.951
even if your friend

22:33.953 --> 22:36.454
de-friends you.

22:36.456 --> 22:37.688
>> Anyway, so we were looking

22:37.690 --> 22:38.689
through your messages,

22:38.691 --> 22:42.460
and basically we found these.

22:45.497 --> 22:46.530
A little over four years of

22:46.532 --> 22:47.331
conversation.

22:47.333 --> 22:51.802
>> 55 pages...

22:51.804 --> 22:54.238
between you and Lucious B

22:54.240 --> 22:57.007
[bleep], going all the way up

22:57.009 --> 23:00.311
to a week ago.

23:00.313 --> 23:01.645
There are times where you ask

23:01.647 --> 23:03.414
to go on ooVoo or Skype.

23:03.416 --> 23:04.081
>> Right.

23:04.083 --> 23:04.882
>> And it looks like you guys

23:04.884 --> 23:06.317
got on with each other.

23:06.319 --> 23:07.518
>> Right.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.819
>> No, I haven't been on

23:08.821 --> 23:09.754
with her.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.323
>> Come on.

23:12.325 --> 23:14.759
>> Yeah--well, this person,

23:14.761 --> 23:16.861
her name is, um...

23:16.863 --> 23:19.397
[clicking tongue]

23:19.399 --> 23:24.835
>> Come on.

23:24.837 --> 23:25.903
>> I didn't hit you up

23:25.905 --> 23:30.241
to do this.

23:30.243 --> 23:32.543
That's what's going on.

23:32.545 --> 23:33.377
>> All right, you want to tell

23:33.379 --> 23:36.981
us what that means?

23:36.983 --> 23:39.817
>> Yes.

23:39.819 --> 23:43.854
She basically hit the show up

23:43.856 --> 23:45.723
to basically try to see me.

23:45.725 --> 23:46.657
>> Okay.

23:46.659 --> 23:47.491
>> And I was like, "Why you

23:47.493 --> 23:48.159
do that?

23:48.161 --> 23:50.361
I want to see you too, but,

23:50.363 --> 23:52.129
like, this is crazy."

23:52.131 --> 23:54.131
Everything just went haywire

23:54.133 --> 23:57.635
from there, and now we're here.

23:57.637 --> 23:59.236
>> You lied to the show so that

23:59.238 --> 24:00.337
you could come on and then

24:00.339 --> 24:02.173
meet each other in person.

24:02.175 --> 24:03.874
>> Yeah.

24:03.876 --> 24:06.477
>> Here's the dilemma.

24:06.479 --> 24:07.778
We've now sat with you for

24:07.780 --> 24:09.447
probably a total of five hours

24:09.449 --> 24:13.017
and listened to 100% lies,

24:13.019 --> 24:14.885
you looking us dead in the eye

24:14.887 --> 24:16.086
and lying to us.

24:16.088 --> 24:17.721
We're in this position that you

24:17.723 --> 24:20.324
so well articulated, that you

24:20.326 --> 24:21.392
don't like being lied to,

24:21.394 --> 24:22.560
because when someone lies to

24:22.562 --> 24:23.461
you, you don't know what's

24:23.463 --> 24:24.762
true and what's not.

24:24.764 --> 24:26.363
And we don't exactly want to air

24:26.365 --> 24:28.933
a show where we get tricked

24:28.935 --> 24:31.535
by two people who may just want

24:31.537 --> 24:32.870
their 15 minutes of fame.

24:32.872 --> 24:35.139
So this is your final shot

24:35.141 --> 24:38.175
to tell us the truth.

24:38.177 --> 24:39.743
>> All right.

24:39.745 --> 24:40.945
>> What's the nature of your

24:40.947 --> 24:43.414
relationship with Bre?

24:43.416 --> 24:45.483
>> We've been talking on and off

24:45.485 --> 24:46.650
for about four years.

24:46.652 --> 24:47.818
>> Are you in love with her?

24:47.820 --> 24:49.220
>> I am in love with her.

24:49.222 --> 24:51.055
She's there, I'm here.

24:51.057 --> 24:53.123
I'm trying to figure out even if

24:53.125 --> 24:54.024
I want to stay in New York

24:54.026 --> 24:54.825
or not.

24:54.827 --> 24:58.496
I want to see her to make sure

24:58.498 --> 24:59.997
that if I do decide to move

24:59.999 --> 25:02.967
to California, that I'm gonna be

25:02.969 --> 25:06.036
with her and everything is what

25:06.038 --> 25:07.972
she says it is and what we

25:07.974 --> 25:09.106
want it to be.

25:09.108 --> 25:11.108
>> There have to be easier ways

25:11.110 --> 25:14.311
to arrange to see one another.

25:14.313 --> 25:15.513
>> I know I won't be able to

25:15.515 --> 25:16.947
afford a ticket to go to

25:16.949 --> 25:17.681
California.

25:17.683 --> 25:18.682
Like, I know that.

25:18.684 --> 25:21.285
I'm, like, the sole breadwinner

25:21.287 --> 25:23.354
in my household right now.

25:26.925 --> 25:27.758
>> We've never been in this

25:27.760 --> 25:28.792
position.

25:28.794 --> 25:31.061
The authenticity of our show has

25:31.063 --> 25:33.731
really been, you know, sort of

25:33.733 --> 25:34.765
compromised.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.534
We need some time to figure out

25:36.536 --> 25:37.401
how we feel.

25:37.403 --> 25:38.369
I think you need some time to

25:38.371 --> 25:39.270
figure out how you feel,

25:39.272 --> 25:40.070
considering this all just

25:40.072 --> 25:41.138
came to light.

25:41.140 --> 25:42.439
We're gonna talk to Bre.

25:42.441 --> 25:43.407
We're gonna hear what she has

25:43.409 --> 25:44.341
to say about this.

25:44.343 --> 25:46.343
We'll check back in with you,

25:46.345 --> 25:48.045
maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.179
>> All right.

25:49.181 --> 25:51.649
>> Okay.

25:51.651 --> 25:52.783
See you later.

25:52.785 --> 25:53.450
>> Bye.

25:53.452 --> 25:55.519
>> Bye.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.893
>> I just always get so freaked

26:02.895 --> 26:04.662
out when people just can sit

26:04.664 --> 26:06.297
across from you and lie

26:06.299 --> 26:07.831
like that.

26:07.833 --> 26:11.402
>> ♪ I have left my only son ♪

26:11.404 --> 26:13.304
♪ And he is so all alone ♪

26:13.306 --> 26:14.638
>> I don't know now how to

26:14.640 --> 26:16.173
evaluate the situation.

26:16.175 --> 26:17.608
Could it be a love story or

26:17.610 --> 26:19.209
just 15 minutes of fame?

26:19.211 --> 26:20.077
>> Well, I think it's gonna be

26:20.079 --> 26:21.045
really interesting to see what

26:21.047 --> 26:22.746
Bre has to say about all this.

26:22.748 --> 26:23.480
We got to make sure

26:23.482 --> 26:25.549
the stories match up.

26:29.521 --> 26:31.455
>> Here we are in Brooklyn.

26:31.457 --> 26:33.057
The question is, are we going to

26:33.059 --> 26:36.827
take Whitney to L.A.?

26:43.568 --> 26:44.635
>> Frankly, we don't know if we

26:44.637 --> 26:45.970
have an episode here.

26:45.972 --> 26:46.870
>> Right, but let's give them

26:46.872 --> 26:47.771
a ring.

26:47.773 --> 26:50.307
[line trilling]

26:50.309 --> 26:52.376
>> Hey, Marshall, how you doing?
>> Good.

26:52.378 --> 26:53.210
>> Good.

26:53.211 --> 26:54.043
>> As you know, we're shooting
an episode right now in

26:54.046 --> 26:55.045
an episode right now in

26:55.046 --> 26:56.045
We had a bit of a curveball.

26:56.048 --> 26:58.482
We discovered that Bre and

26:58.484 --> 27:00.217
Whitney are actually friends.

27:00.219 --> 27:02.219
They've sent each other hundreds

27:02.221 --> 27:03.587
and hundreds of messages over

27:03.589 --> 27:04.955
the past four years.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.490
>> And they've been Skyping,

27:06.492 --> 27:08.359
and they conspired to get

27:08.361 --> 27:10.427
on the show.

27:13.498 --> 27:14.932
>> Yes, so now we're in

27:14.934 --> 27:16.000
a position where we need to

27:16.002 --> 27:17.735
decide what to do, because we're

27:17.737 --> 27:18.636
making this show about these

27:18.638 --> 27:21.071
people who don't necessarily

27:21.073 --> 27:21.905
need our help.

27:21.907 --> 27:23.040
But there's still a chance that

27:23.042 --> 27:25.009
these two women could really

27:25.011 --> 27:26.310
be in love with each other.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.512
We're a little uncertain about

27:28.514 --> 27:30.581
what the next move should be.

27:35.387 --> 27:36.286
>> When we first met her,

27:36.288 --> 27:37.287
we thought her story was

27:37.289 --> 27:40.057
really sincere, and...

27:40.059 --> 27:40.891
>> She--

27:40.893 --> 27:41.959
>> She really won us over.

27:41.961 --> 27:43.160
>> She's hard-working,

27:43.162 --> 27:44.695
single-handedly supports her

27:44.697 --> 27:46.363
four brothers and her mom.

27:46.365 --> 27:47.865
She's, like, the underdog hero

27:47.867 --> 27:49.833
that everyone wants to root for.

27:49.835 --> 27:51.168
We don't really know now how we

27:51.170 --> 27:52.369
feel about her, because I'm not

27:52.371 --> 27:54.338
even sure what to believe about

27:54.340 --> 27:56.407
anything she's told us.

28:18.763 --> 28:19.730
>> Yeah, we've all been

28:19.732 --> 28:21.799
catfished.

28:29.174 --> 28:31.241
>> Right.

28:35.113 --> 28:36.547
>> All right, speak soon.

28:36.549 --> 28:37.648
Bye-bye.

28:37.650 --> 28:39.149
>> It's up to us.

28:39.151 --> 28:40.084
>> I think the thing that I've

28:40.086 --> 28:41.418
been waiting and most anxious

28:41.420 --> 28:43.620
about is speaking to Bre.

28:43.622 --> 28:45.022
All right, let's call her.

28:45.024 --> 28:47.558
[line trilling]

28:47.560 --> 28:51.495
>> Hello, is this Brenell?

28:51.497 --> 28:53.697
>> Hi, this is Nev and Max

28:53.699 --> 28:55.899
from the show <i> Catfish.</i>

28:55.901 --> 28:59.336
I'm not sure if you spoke to

28:59.338 --> 29:03.073
Whitney last night.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.908
Okay, so you basically know,

29:04.910 --> 29:06.477
then, that we discovered that

29:06.479 --> 29:07.578
you guys actually do know each

29:07.580 --> 29:09.113
other and that this was a lie

29:09.115 --> 29:10.781
that you guys put together,

29:10.783 --> 29:12.082
and so we were just curious

29:12.084 --> 29:14.485
to get your side of the story.

29:29.801 --> 29:30.768
>> You have ooVoo'd or

29:30.770 --> 29:35.139
video chatted, right?

29:35.141 --> 29:36.006
>> We're in an interesting

29:36.008 --> 29:37.741
situation now, because we're

29:37.743 --> 29:39.810
a little upset that you guys

29:39.812 --> 29:41.411
sort of tried to pull one over

29:41.413 --> 29:42.880
on us, and kind of did.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.381
Even though sections of your

29:44.383 --> 29:46.350
story are obviously true,

29:46.352 --> 29:47.584
we're starting to feel like

29:47.586 --> 29:49.019
maybe you guys were just

29:49.021 --> 29:49.987
interested in being

29:49.989 --> 29:52.055
on a TV show.

29:57.929 --> 30:00.063
>> It's such a crazy idea to me.

30:00.065 --> 30:01.331
The way you guys were gonna meet

30:01.333 --> 30:03.033
was that you were gonna get

30:03.035 --> 30:04.568
yourselves on to this

30:04.570 --> 30:06.637
reality show.

30:34.499 --> 30:35.799
>> Here, this is Max.

30:35.801 --> 30:37.234
I'm all for bringing you guys

30:37.236 --> 30:40.003
together, but we want to know

30:40.005 --> 30:42.606
now that you're serious.

30:47.712 --> 30:48.879
>> You know, this is all kind of

30:48.881 --> 30:51.315
happening fast for us,

30:51.317 --> 30:52.449
trying to figure out what to do

30:52.451 --> 30:53.383
on our side of things.

30:53.385 --> 30:55.485
But we're gonna go talk to

30:55.487 --> 30:58.322
Whitney again today and make

30:58.324 --> 31:00.724
a decision based on that.

31:04.362 --> 31:05.662
>> She said all the right

31:05.664 --> 31:06.396
things.

31:06.398 --> 31:07.364
That's what we wanted

31:07.366 --> 31:08.498
from Whitney yesterday.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.100
>> Right, I just want to know

31:10.102 --> 31:11.535
if this could really be

31:11.537 --> 31:12.469
a true love story.

31:12.471 --> 31:14.238
>> I am gonna hold out

31:14.240 --> 31:16.006
until we talk to Whitney.

31:16.008 --> 31:17.007
>> Let's head over to Whitney's

31:17.009 --> 31:18.375
and see what she has to say.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.444
>> What she's got to say.

31:24.816 --> 31:28.018
>> ♪ Empty my mind ♪

31:28.020 --> 31:31.188
♪ Just to see what's left ♪

31:31.190 --> 31:32.222
>> Well, it'll be interesting to

31:32.224 --> 31:34.258
see if Whitney's got

31:34.260 --> 31:36.727
a different story to tell today.

31:36.729 --> 31:38.929
>> Well, she's had all night to

31:38.931 --> 31:40.530
kind of process what happened

31:40.532 --> 31:42.299
and talk to Bre.

32:01.720 --> 32:02.486

32:02.488 --> 32:04.554
>> Hey.

32:09.093 --> 32:11.028
>> What's going on?

32:11.030 --> 32:15.299
>> I had some time to think
about it, and...

32:15.301 --> 32:17.551
about it, and...

32:17.552 --> 32:19.802
Well, I felt really, really bad,
like, lying to you guys.

32:19.805 --> 32:21.321
like, lying to you guys.

32:21.322 --> 32:22.838
It felt horrible.

32:22.841 --> 32:24.308
So I want to apologize

32:24.310 --> 32:25.509
to you guys again.

32:25.511 --> 32:26.944
It felt like maybe this is,

32:26.946 --> 32:28.378
like, the only time that I'll

32:28.380 --> 32:30.314
probably be able to get this

32:30.316 --> 32:31.882
chance to even see you.

32:31.884 --> 32:33.550
So I went along with it.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.619
I love her.

32:39.657 --> 32:40.691
She's been there with me

32:40.693 --> 32:41.658
every step of the way.

32:41.660 --> 32:42.926
When I was having problems with,

32:42.928 --> 32:45.329
like, my family, the one person

32:45.331 --> 32:48.498
I could talk to was her.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.600
The whole thing on my mind was,

32:50.602 --> 32:51.668
like, "Yo, I'm really gonna

32:51.670 --> 32:52.703
see her, like, I'm really

32:52.705 --> 32:55.038
gonna see her," and, like,

32:55.040 --> 32:57.007
it just came from a lie, though,

32:57.009 --> 32:59.576
instead of the truth.

32:59.578 --> 33:00.911
>> We spoke to her this morning.

33:00.913 --> 33:03.213
She seemed really sweet.

33:03.215 --> 33:05.282
She was also very apologetic

33:05.284 --> 33:08.518
and painted a very beautiful

33:08.520 --> 33:10.053
picture of your relationship

33:10.055 --> 33:12.489
together, how much meeting you

33:12.491 --> 33:13.523
is really what she wants

33:13.525 --> 33:14.691
and how she really cares

33:14.693 --> 33:15.559
about you.

33:15.561 --> 33:18.428
So I think, for me, we're here,

33:18.430 --> 33:19.763
we're in this situation.

33:19.765 --> 33:20.630
This is not the kind of thing

33:20.632 --> 33:21.531
that happens a lot.

33:21.533 --> 33:22.733
I mean, everything about this

33:22.735 --> 33:24.101
is sort of backwards.

33:24.103 --> 33:26.970
But I believe that, at the core,

33:26.972 --> 33:28.705
two young people who really

33:28.707 --> 33:29.639
care about each other.

33:29.641 --> 33:30.674
>> Yeah.

33:30.676 --> 33:32.376
>> If you guys came this far

33:32.378 --> 33:33.210
because you wanted to meet

33:33.212 --> 33:34.411
each other, and got to

33:34.413 --> 33:35.612
the second day of the show

33:35.614 --> 33:37.681
without anyone realizing

33:37.683 --> 33:39.082
what you were doing, then that

33:39.084 --> 33:40.484
definitely shows a lot of

33:40.486 --> 33:41.818
motivation and initiative

33:41.820 --> 33:43.153
to--to meet each other.

33:43.155 --> 33:45.188
Like, clearly there's a passion

33:45.190 --> 33:46.056
there.

33:46.058 --> 33:47.691
>> I think we believe that

33:47.693 --> 33:48.358
you're sorry.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.359
I know that I, for one,

33:49.361 --> 33:50.761
forgive you.

33:50.763 --> 33:52.329
We're in a position to bring

33:52.331 --> 33:55.799
you guys together.

33:55.801 --> 33:59.002
I'm ready to do that,

33:59.004 --> 34:00.137
if you guys are.

34:00.139 --> 34:01.405
>> I'm ready for it.

34:01.407 --> 34:02.172
>> That's the first time

34:02.174 --> 34:03.907
I've seen you smile.

34:03.909 --> 34:06.143
>> Now you can, like, be hon--

34:06.145 --> 34:08.178
like, be open about it, yeah.

34:08.179 --> 34:08.945
>> This is awesome.

34:08.947 --> 34:09.946
>> It really is.

37:09.861 --> 37:11.127
I got lipstick all on your

37:11.129 --> 37:11.795
shirt.

37:11.797 --> 37:13.163
Oh, my god, I got lipstick

37:13.165 --> 37:13.897
everywhere.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.098
>> It's all right.

37:15.100 --> 37:15.832
>> Hi.

37:15.834 --> 37:16.566
>> Hi.

37:16.568 --> 37:17.434
>> Nice to meet you.

37:17.436 --> 37:19.202
>> I'm, like, shaking right now.

37:19.204 --> 37:20.403
>> Take a little tissue here.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.005
[laughter]

37:22.007 --> 37:23.673
Yeah, clean her up, will you?

37:23.675 --> 37:25.809
>> This is cute.

37:25.811 --> 37:26.610
>> You know, normally in these

37:26.612 --> 37:27.477
situations, we're asking

37:27.479 --> 37:28.578
questions because we don't know

37:28.580 --> 37:30.113
what's true and false,

37:30.115 --> 37:31.514
but I think--it sounds like

37:31.516 --> 37:32.582
everything we know about you--

37:32.584 --> 37:33.650
>> It's true.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.185
Just the lie that, you know,

37:35.187 --> 37:37.354
that I told to be here.

37:37.356 --> 37:38.521
>> You guys did a pretty

37:38.523 --> 37:39.189
good job.

37:39.191 --> 37:40.023
You pulled one over on us,

37:40.025 --> 37:40.924
for the most part.

37:40.926 --> 37:41.658
>> I'm sorry.

37:41.660 --> 37:42.826
>> I know.

37:42.828 --> 37:43.860
>> But you didn't tell her to

37:43.862 --> 37:45.428
delete your conversation

37:45.430 --> 37:46.296
on Facebook.

37:46.298 --> 37:47.230
>> No, I didn't delete

37:47.232 --> 37:48.131
mine either.

37:48.133 --> 37:50.133
Those conversations is--

37:50.135 --> 37:51.835
I can never delete, like--

37:51.837 --> 37:53.003
That's part of my life.

37:53.005 --> 37:55.505
I tell this woman everything.

37:55.507 --> 37:56.339
>> I mean, can you believe that

37:56.341 --> 37:57.107
it worked out?

37:57.109 --> 37:57.874
Did you really think it was

37:57.876 --> 37:58.541
actually gonna happen?

37:58.543 --> 37:59.943
>> No, but I'm glad it did.

37:59.945 --> 38:02.612
I really want to thank you guys

38:02.614 --> 38:04.414
and say sorry at the same time.

38:04.416 --> 38:06.650
Like--ah!

38:06.652 --> 38:08.785
>> So you two take some time,

38:08.787 --> 38:10.120
enjoy the day.

38:10.122 --> 38:11.288
We'll see you later.

38:11.290 --> 38:14.824
Snack, whatever, do your thing.

38:14.826 --> 38:16.326
>> I can't believe it.

38:16.328 --> 38:17.560
My Teddy.

38:17.562 --> 38:18.361
>> Yes.

38:18.363 --> 38:19.763
>> Oh, my gosh.

38:19.765 --> 38:21.164
Was it really worth the wait?

38:21.166 --> 38:22.599
>> Yes, yes.

38:22.601 --> 38:23.900
Ye-heh-es.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.001
>> [laughs]

38:25.003 --> 38:27.070
I'm excited.

38:31.375 --> 38:32.075
>> Aw.

38:32.077 --> 38:33.143
>> What?

38:33.145 --> 38:34.177
>> I really love you.

38:34.179 --> 38:35.378
Like, I love the [bleep]

38:35.380 --> 38:36.646
out of you, for real.

38:36.648 --> 38:37.947
I promise.

38:37.949 --> 38:39.249
This is, like, the start

38:39.251 --> 38:40.583
of everything right now.

38:40.585 --> 38:41.851
>> Mm-hmm.

38:41.853 --> 38:43.153
So come, go take a walk.

38:43.155 --> 38:43.853
>> All right.

38:43.855 --> 38:46.423
>> ♪ I want to be a shadow ♪

38:46.425 --> 38:48.425
>> Even though we got catfished,

38:48.427 --> 38:49.659
I think it was a catfish

38:49.661 --> 38:50.794
for good and it was worth it.

38:50.796 --> 38:51.895
>> It was a catfish for good.

38:51.897 --> 38:52.796
>> 'Cause look how--these ladies

38:52.798 --> 38:54.597
are really in love.

38:54.599 --> 38:55.765
I'm just happy that two people

38:55.767 --> 38:58.535
met each other, and even though

38:58.537 --> 39:00.036
we got sort of roped into it,

39:00.038 --> 39:01.304
love finds a way.

39:01.306 --> 39:04.441
>> ♪ I want to be a shadow ♪

39:04.443 --> 39:05.308
>> This is amazing.

39:05.310 --> 39:06.443
It's, like, the best day

39:06.445 --> 39:08.511
of my life.

39:13.384 --> 39:14.050
>> Hey-o!

39:14.052 --> 39:14.718
>> Hey!

39:14.720 --> 39:15.518
>> Hey, what's going on?

39:15.520 --> 39:16.252
>> How's it going?

39:16.254 --> 39:17.387
You're still in Brooklyn.

39:17.389 --> 39:18.088
>> Yeah.

39:18.090 --> 39:19.322
>> How are things with you and

39:19.324 --> 39:20.724
work and your family?

39:20.726 --> 39:21.858
>> Work is actually great.

39:21.860 --> 39:24.861
Like, my family, I talk to them

39:24.863 --> 39:25.895
more about Bre.

39:25.897 --> 39:26.730
I can't wait for her to meet

39:26.732 --> 39:27.330
them.

39:27.332 --> 39:28.231
She's actually planning on

39:28.233 --> 39:29.499
coming out here soon,

39:29.501 --> 39:31.501
and then the month after she

39:31.503 --> 39:32.402
comes out here, I'm gonna

39:32.404 --> 39:34.471
be out there.

39:39.410 --> 39:40.477
>> And the relationship is...

39:40.479 --> 39:41.311
>> It's good?

39:41.313 --> 39:42.712
>> Yeah, it's great, actually.

39:42.714 --> 39:43.780
>> What did we miss?

39:43.782 --> 39:44.914
>> Yeah, did you guys get it on,

39:44.916 --> 39:45.749
or what?

39:45.751 --> 39:46.783
>> [laughs]

39:46.785 --> 39:47.717
>> That's private.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.085
>> No, it's not private,

39:49.087 --> 39:51.287
not when--she owes us.

39:51.289 --> 39:52.489
>> Did you see who came

39:52.491 --> 39:53.356
down that hill?

39:53.358 --> 39:55.425
Like, yeah.

40:01.899 --> 40:03.066
>> Why don't we add Bre

40:03.068 --> 40:04.033
to the call?

40:04.035 --> 40:05.635
Add people.

40:05.637 --> 40:06.469
>> Hey!

40:06.471 --> 40:07.670
Whoa!

40:07.672 --> 40:08.805
>> How is everything, Bre?

40:08.807 --> 40:11.074
>> I'm great, never been better.

40:11.076 --> 40:12.208
>> Looks like, and it sounds

40:12.210 --> 40:14.077
like you guys are a couple.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.044
>> You might as well say it,

40:15.046 --> 40:16.379
but we don't put a title on it.

40:16.381 --> 40:17.580
It just is what it is.

40:17.582 --> 40:18.648
>> Are you guys in love?

40:18.650 --> 40:20.884
>> Of course I love her, yeah.

40:20.886 --> 40:22.519
>> So then there you go.

40:22.521 --> 40:23.887
What lesson did we learn?

40:23.889 --> 40:26.656
>> Just keep it honest, so true.

40:26.658 --> 40:28.691
>> You guys had a beautiful,

40:28.693 --> 40:30.894
pure intention, and you did

40:30.896 --> 40:32.495
a little bit of, you know,

40:32.497 --> 40:34.030
finagling to get what you

40:34.032 --> 40:35.799
needed, but in the end, I think

40:35.801 --> 40:37.333
it was worth it for all of us.

40:37.335 --> 40:38.701
We're really happy for you guys.

40:38.703 --> 40:39.669
Nice to see you both.

40:39.671 --> 40:40.937
Good luck with everything.

40:40.939 --> 40:41.805
>> Later, guys.

40:41.807 --> 40:43.039
>> Bye.

40:44.975 --> 40:45.775
>> It's a little unusual.

40:45.777 --> 40:46.576
Two people are talking online,

40:46.578 --> 40:47.677
and one of them says, "Hey,

40:47.679 --> 40:49.212
let's meet on <i> Catfish."</i>

40:49.214 --> 40:50.413
"I think it's the only way I

40:50.415 --> 40:52.015
will find out what she isn't

40:52.017 --> 40:53.550
telling me and if we can take it

40:53.552 --> 40:54.584
to the next level."

40:54.586 --> 40:55.685
>> But you trust her?

40:55.687 --> 40:59.022
>> I do, I trust her.

40:59.024 --> 41:00.190
>> The harder it is to find

41:00.192 --> 41:01.791
that secret, the more sinister

41:01.793 --> 41:02.992
that secret seems.
