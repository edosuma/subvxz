14:00.174 --> 14:02.384
-Wander?
-I can't hear you at all.

14:02.676 --> 14:05.762
Are you moving around?
You should maybe try moving around.

14:06.221 --> 14:07.306
(GROANS)

14:07.389 --> 14:10.517
Just tell me where you are!

14:11.101 --> 14:13.478
Oh, maybe I should just
tell you where I am.

14:13.812 --> 14:16.106
Well, I'm not sure where I am.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.942
It's wet, dark and warm.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.944
And there's water sloshing all around me.

14:21.028 --> 14:24.615
But don't you worry about me.
I've got the hat.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.035
I've got the hat.

14:28.118 --> 14:30.329
Oh, wait. You've got the hat.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.998
Just stay put. I'll come find you.

14:33.165 --> 14:35.417
I guess I'll just stay put,
and you can find me.

(EXHALES DEEPLY) Okay.
Maybe I wasn't making myself clear.

15:51.201 --> 15:53.120
We need to save Wander.

15:53.495 --> 15:55.622
So we need to go there,

15:55.706 --> 15:59.168
without attracting attention of
the giant Zbornak-eating monster.

15:59.251 --> 16:00.252

When do you think you might get here?
