Hello, Cleavers.

03:29.039 --> 03:30.631
Hello, June.

03:30.707 --> 03:33.073
Hello, Ward.

03:33.143 --> 03:35.907
Oh, I see Eddie Haskell is here.

03:37.814 --> 03:40.681
I'm so proud.
My son, the delivery boy.

03:40.751 --> 03:43.015
Your mom's birthday's coming up.

03:43.086 --> 03:45.145
What are you gonna steal
for her this year?

03:45.222 --> 03:48.623
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Ma, what doyou want?

03:48.692 --> 03:51.456
- Surprise me.
- I will!

03:51.528 --> 03:55.897
Pestario, you're just
a common hustler.

03:57.601 --> 04:00.832
There is nothing common
about the way I dance!

04:02.606 --> 04:04.369
Shall we?

04:14.785 --> 04:16.252
Mom!

04:16.319 --> 04:17.616
Great.

04:17.687 --> 04:20.519
That was nasty.
Look at the time.

04:20.589 --> 04:25.084
So long, my family. I must go to work.
Love, peace and chicken grease.

04:32.102 --> 04:34.366
Good morning, Pestario.

04:46.850 --> 04:50.308
Mr. Shank, we've been searching
for hours.

04:50.387 --> 04:54.790
No one in this neighborhood
will fulfill our needs.

04:54.858 --> 04:57.326
Perhaps we should return home?

04:57.394 --> 04:59.157
You're too impatient, Leo.

04:59.229 --> 05:01.891
A good hunter must always remember...

05:01.965 --> 05:06.231
the most challenging prey is often
the most difficult to find.

05:13.477 --> 05:17.277
Father Shillelagh.
How are your Blarney stones?

05:19.149 --> 05:24.416
I wanted to thank you personally
for helping at the church bazaar.

05:24.488 --> 05:27.651
- It was bizarre, wasn't it?
- Yes, it was.

05:27.724 --> 05:30.921
You know, your booth
made more money than any other.

05:30.994 --> 05:32.962
What can I say?

05:33.029 --> 05:36.897
It was impossible to knock down
those milk bottles.

05:36.967 --> 05:40.027
You don't suppose
it was divine intervention?

05:40.103 --> 05:42.071
Father, if this is the way
you keep secrets...

05:42.139 --> 05:45.802
I'm gonna save my juicy confessions
for Father Garcia.

05:45.876 --> 05:49.937
I'll sail away now. Lucky Charms,
they're magically delicious!

05:50.013 --> 05:51.947
Bless you, my son.

05:53.016 --> 05:54.278
I think.

05:54.351 --> 05:57.218
Children! Such carefree exuberance.

05:57.287 --> 05:59.687
Such pure innocence at play.

06:02.259 --> 06:04.420
Those little runts.
I'll teach 'em.

06:04.494 --> 06:08.658
Hey, moron, we need one more
for basketball.

06:08.732 --> 06:11.530
You're with the fat loser-boy.

06:11.601 --> 06:15.935
- Why do they call you fat loser-boy?
- I think because I'm fat and never win.

06:16.006 --> 06:19.874
We're gonna change that.
The part about never winning.

06:19.943 --> 06:23.140
Bet your lunches.
First point wins.

06:25.882 --> 06:29.818
All right, you son of a freak,
no fouls, no calls, no outs. Check.

06:29.886 --> 06:31.319
Sucker!

06:58.048 --> 07:03.111
What? It's all your fault! Lf you were
a good player, may be we would've won.

07:03.186 --> 07:07.122
We won! We won!
Give me your lunches.

07:07.190 --> 07:10.523
That'll teach you a lesson.
Get outta here!

07:12.028 --> 07:15.828
Don't worry, they'll never call you
a loser again.

07:15.899 --> 07:18.094
Thanks, mister.

07:18.168 --> 07:21.331
Hey, mister, wait a minute.
I'm stuck.

07:27.811 --> 07:31.110
- Is that the Mack Daddy pimp?
- What's up?

07:31.181 --> 07:34.617
- What's up?
- Lunch is on me, freaks.

07:34.684 --> 07:39.678
So where is my super-scam
shell game apparatus?

07:39.756 --> 07:42.350
Pest, don't doubt me.
We got it.

07:44.194 --> 07:47.891
Excellent, man.
This scam is fool proof.

07:47.964 --> 07:51.161
I'm gonna be the King of Corruption.
The Duke of Deception.

07:51.234 --> 07:55.830
Whoa. Pest, that's what you say
about all your scams.

07:55.905 --> 08:00.865
- What about your bets with the mob?
- Yeah. You owe them $50,000.

08:00.944 --> 08:02.878
Are you guys my accountants?

08:02.946 --> 08:07.007
For God's sake, have a little faith
in the Pest. A little faith.

08:07.083 --> 08:09.381
I got all my bases covered.
I got contingency plans.

08:09.452 --> 08:12.717
Pest. All we're saying is that...

08:12.789 --> 08:15.019
this scamming thing's dangerous.

08:15.091 --> 08:18.891
All right. Lfit will make my bestest
of friends feel better...

08:18.962 --> 08:24.400
I'm going to promise I'm never
going to scam again as long as I live.

08:24.467 --> 08:26.401
That would be good.

08:26.469 --> 08:29.632
- I'm proud of you.
- We can stop getting you out oftrouble.

08:29.706 --> 08:34.871
The key to this scam
is to convince people I am blind.

08:35.611 --> 08:37.044
You never learn.

08:41.116 --> 08:44.416
WelCome to the festival of Miami.

09:07.977 --> 09:10.969
These people are all so teeny!

09:12.615 --> 09:15.209
There must be
a worthy candidate here.

09:20.223 --> 09:22.987
Pest, look, there's Xantha.

09:23.059 --> 09:24.788
Hey, baby! Hey, baby!

09:24.861 --> 09:26.829
We'll catch up to you later.

09:28.031 --> 09:30.829
Hey, baby.
How's my Nubian bucket of love?

09:30.900 --> 09:33.164
My ebony delight,
my Africanicus romanticus.

09:33.236 --> 09:35.898
Where was your sorry Latin buttocks
last night?

09:35.972 --> 09:38.167
Baby, easy with the nagging.

09:38.241 --> 09:40.766
You missed dinner with my parents!

09:40.844 --> 09:44.905
Yeah! You missed dinner
with her parents last night, loser!

09:46.116 --> 09:48.914
Do you mind if l talk
to my girlfriend alone?

09:48.985 --> 09:51.510
Anything you have to say to me,
you can say in front of Malaria.

09:51.588 --> 09:53.852
- Anything?
- Anything!

09:53.923 --> 09:57.017
Fine. Malaria's got mossy teeth
and a fat butt!

09:57.861 --> 10:00.159
These jeans make me look fat.

10:00.230 --> 10:03.825
No, Malaria.
Your fat butt makes you look fat.

10:03.900 --> 10:05.834
Baby, I'm sorry.

10:05.902 --> 10:08.700
There's nothing more I want to do
than be with my girlfriend's parents.

10:08.772 --> 10:12.105
Let's reschedule a site for tomorrow.
Huh, curly locks?

10:12.175 --> 10:14.439
- Can't.
- Why?

10:20.417 --> 10:23.784
Baby, what a dufus! What a freak!
I totally forgot...

10:23.853 --> 10:25.514
Forget it. I'm outta here.

10:25.588 --> 10:28.284
Xantha-poo, come on, baby.

10:28.358 --> 10:30.326
I'll skip my previous commitment.

10:30.393 --> 10:32.861
Really?
You'll come to dinner?

10:32.929 --> 10:36.729
Abso freaking lutely. I'll make your
parents love me and ask me to marry you.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.030
- How?
- I'll tell 'em you're pregnant.

10:39.102 --> 10:41.161
- What?
- He'll tell 'em you're pregnant.

10:41.237 --> 10:43.933
Pest-man, we gotta go. Sorry.

10:44.007 --> 10:45.941
Love, peace and chicken grease.

10:46.009 --> 10:47.442
Bye, honey.

10:47.510 --> 10:50.138
You're pregnant?

10:59.989 --> 11:01.616
Step right up.

11:01.691 --> 11:05.058
Money is flying out of my pocket.
Play the coconut shell game.

11:05.128 --> 11:07.062
There's a winner born every minute.

11:07.130 --> 11:10.361
I got $20 that says
I can find that ball.

11:10.433 --> 11:12.560
Okay, people, we've got a taker.

11:12.635 --> 11:17.538
Cross my hand, I fool the rich man,
poor man, but not the policeman.

11:17.607 --> 11:23.011
Which shell is it under?
You must tell me because I'm blind.

11:23.847 --> 11:27.214
Soccer boy, come here.
Yeah, you.

11:27.283 --> 11:29.513
- Oh, there you are.
- How'd you catch that ball?

11:29.586 --> 11:32.919
Telepathy. You lose one sense,
you gain another.

11:32.989 --> 11:36.220
- How'd you know I was male?
- I could hear your gonads shaking.

11:36.292 --> 11:38.920
You should wear more support, shorty.

11:42.599 --> 11:45.727
Maybe, maybe.
Yeah, that's more like it.

11:47.203 --> 11:49.603
That is the specimen I want.

11:49.672 --> 11:53.369
Find out about him, and I'll make
the necessary preparations.

11:53.443 --> 11:55.172
Yes, Mr. Shank.

11:58.648 --> 12:00.616
Oh! What a pathetic choice.

12:02.385 --> 12:04.853
Which shell is it under?

12:04.921 --> 12:07.287
Sorry, sucker, you lose.

12:07.357 --> 12:09.154
No, you lose, brah!

12:09.225 --> 12:11.420
Did I hear something fall?

12:11.494 --> 12:13.052
Knock, knock. Who's there?

12:13.129 --> 12:15.290
We work for Angus.
Are you Pest Vargas?

12:15.365 --> 12:17.299
Are you the doctor?

12:17.367 --> 12:20.131
Oh, my, Grandma,
what large pores you have.

12:20.203 --> 12:22.433
Definitely not a plastic surgeon.

12:22.505 --> 12:25.167
Oh, my God, you're hideous.
Repulsive, even!

12:25.241 --> 12:27.903
You have a lump!
You poor mis shapen creature!

12:27.977 --> 12:30.537
We can profit from your misfortune.

12:30.613 --> 12:34.447
For $1, take a picture
with Elephant Man in a kilt!

12:34.517 --> 12:35.779
Get him!

12:37.520 --> 12:39.317
Do something! You know karate!

12:43.192 --> 12:45.126
Angus wants his money.

12:45.194 --> 12:47.492
You wouldn't hit a blind man,
would you?

12:48.398 --> 12:51.492
How do you feel about asthmatics?
I can't breathe!

12:52.669 --> 12:55.604
Emotionally-challenged people?

12:58.474 --> 13:01.671
What about epileptics?
Hold my tongue!

13:02.745 --> 13:05.737
- Get 'em!
- You guys are in trouble now.

13:05.815 --> 13:08.943
- Chubby and I will take care of them!
- Chubby and I?

13:09.919 --> 13:13.047
Let's air our differences, fellas.

13:44.053 --> 13:46.647
My favorite delivery boy.

13:46.723 --> 13:48.657
What happened to you?
You late!

13:54.163 --> 13:56.290
Me love you long time.

13:56.366 --> 13:59.494
Wait. Why I don't understand
any of your Chinese?

14:00.703 --> 14:04.230
I from south. Different dialect.
Right? Everybody know that.

14:04.307 --> 14:07.208
So am I. I am from south, too.

14:07.276 --> 14:10.370
But I from far, far, far south!

14:10.446 --> 14:12.380
Eat some grits, y'all.

14:12.448 --> 14:14.382
Wherever you come from,
you late for last time.

14:14.450 --> 14:19.114
You don't look Chinese. You look like
Moe from Three Stooges. You're fired.

14:19.188 --> 14:24.125
Please, give me another chance!
I'll never do it again, I promise.

14:24.193 --> 14:27.526
You don't know the troubles I've seen!
My grandmother's sick.

14:27.597 --> 14:30.225
I've got a good excuse this time.
Listen.

14:30.299 --> 14:33.200
I was taking a walk with my pet dog...

14:33.269 --> 14:35.533
Duck. My duck!

14:35.605 --> 14:37.903
When he ranned off on me,
I was about to...

14:37.974 --> 14:40.636
Oh, my God!

14:40.710 --> 14:44.942
Quacky! Quacky!
What have they did to you?

14:45.014 --> 14:48.472
- Which one is he?
- I don't know.

14:48.551 --> 14:51.714
They all look the same!

14:54.157 --> 14:57.558
I'll have to call my lawyer
and tell him I can't find Quacky.

14:57.627 --> 14:59.060
Lawyer?

15:01.564 --> 15:04.055
This must be Quacky,
with that sweet little smile.

15:04.133 --> 15:05.566
Gimme that!

15:05.635 --> 15:09.765
Poor little Quacky. Don't worry.
I'll bury you in France likeyou wanted.

15:09.839 --> 15:13.172
- You kill Quacky?
- No! L, I might have.

15:13.242 --> 15:16.643
- Why?
- I'm sorry.

15:16.713 --> 15:19.238
I loved little Quacky.

15:19.315 --> 15:21.146
- Mr. Cheung?
- Yes?

15:21.217 --> 15:23.185
- Can I talk toyou?
- Yes.

15:23.252 --> 15:26.483
Can I talk toyou over here?
Over here?

15:26.556 --> 15:29.081
- Over here?
- Okay.

15:29.158 --> 15:32.150
- Can I use your phone?
- You're not calling your lawyer?

15:32.228 --> 15:33.661
Not yet.

15:33.730 --> 15:37.131
First I have to call my family
and tell them about...

15:37.200 --> 15:39.395
About Quacky.

15:39.469 --> 15:41.664
Yes, ofcourse, ofcourse.

15:41.738 --> 15:45.003
Don't worry. Anything you need,
just let me know.

15:45.074 --> 15:48.043
- Okay, there is one thing.
- Yes?

15:48.111 --> 15:51.638
Quacky always wanted
to be served extra-crispy.

15:51.714 --> 15:53.648
- Could you do that?
- No problem.

15:53.716 --> 15:57.345
No MSG? An extra order of rice?
Thank you.

15:57.420 --> 16:01.117
You're very welcome. Don't worry.
I take care of you.

16:01.190 --> 16:03.351
You're wonderful.
Really.

16:14.871 --> 16:16.702
Hello.

16:16.773 --> 16:18.468
Angusie?

16:19.809 --> 16:23.108
You rapscallion!
You naughty man, you!

16:23.179 --> 16:27.707
I'm hurted you sent ruffians after me.
I was gonna surprise you with a check!

16:27.784 --> 16:30.082
Listen. You've owed $50,000
for three weeks!

16:30.153 --> 16:33.554
You'd show more respect
if we were the Italian mob.

16:33.623 --> 16:35.386
Don't start again.

16:35.458 --> 16:38.052
People don't take us seriously
because we're Scottish.

16:39.228 --> 16:42.720
People will take us seriously
when they see what we do to you.

16:42.799 --> 16:46.530
Angusie, home in sky!
All I need is time.

16:46.602 --> 16:48.194
What is today?

16:48.271 --> 16:50.671
The first day of the rest
of our lives?

16:51.674 --> 16:53.403
Sean Connery's birthday?

16:53.476 --> 16:55.535
Sean Connery's birthday?

17:07.522 --> 17:09.650
Listen. Today is Monday.

17:09.724 --> 17:13.092
I want the money Wednesday
or I'll kill your family.

17:13.162 --> 17:15.790
How 'bout Thursday,
and you just take outa Cousin?

17:15.865 --> 17:18.891
Oh, bad connection.

17:18.968 --> 17:22.199
I bring you the cash...
I can't...

17:22.271 --> 17:23.602
Whatever.

17:24.707 --> 17:28.768
Extra-crispy.
Just like you wanted.

17:28.845 --> 17:31.143
My poor Quacky.

17:33.382 --> 17:36.044
Poor Quacky.
Can I get extra plum sauce?

17:36.118 --> 17:40.077
You have no time.
You have delivery to do! Go! Hurry!

17:40.156 --> 17:41.885
Plum sauce!

17:54.437 --> 17:56.462
Soon I shall return...

17:56.539 --> 17:59.474
to the glorious dank splendor
of the homeland...

17:59.542 --> 18:03.535
and be away from
all this nauseating pastel.

18:03.613 --> 18:05.979
Excuse me.

18:06.048 --> 18:08.278
Your Chinese food has arrived.

18:08.351 --> 18:10.285
Yummy! Where?

18:13.356 --> 18:15.449
Got it, got it, got it!

18:15.524 --> 18:17.458
What is that?

18:17.526 --> 18:20.859
That's the one you requested.
The blind Latino.

18:20.930 --> 18:24.889
I most certainly did not!
I wanted the athletic Latino!

18:24.967 --> 18:28.835
- But you pointed at him.
- Why would I pick a blind man?

18:28.905 --> 18:33.808
Sir, he's not really blind.
He's a scam artist.

18:33.876 --> 18:36.037
A very fast and agile one.

18:37.346 --> 18:41.806
Mr. Vargas here runs numbers out of his
Chinese restaurant, but unfortunately...

18:41.884 --> 18:44.284
some of his own bets
turned sour.

18:44.353 --> 18:47.686
- How sour?
- He owes the Scottish mob $50,000.

18:47.757 --> 18:50.851
I didn't know there was
a Scottish mob!

18:50.927 --> 18:53.361
lf he doesn't pay in two days,
they'll kill him.

19:11.314 --> 19:13.976
- Hello!
- Hi!

19:14.050 --> 19:18.009
Just doing our MSG test.
Everything seems to pass inspection.

19:18.087 --> 19:20.146
That's $52.23 for the food...

19:20.222 --> 19:24.056
$100 delivery charge 'cause
we don't normally come out here.

19:24.126 --> 19:26.993
Why is that?
You afraid of white people?

19:28.297 --> 19:32.233
'Cause you all carry diseases
my people don't have immunities for.

19:32.301 --> 19:35.168
Perhaps you're just being paranoid.

19:35.237 --> 19:37.171
Could you back off?

19:37.239 --> 19:41.073
You spit when you talk.
I'm susceptible to air borne syphilises.

19:41.143 --> 19:43.270
" Pest." Is that your name...

19:43.346 --> 19:45.678
or a personality trait?

19:45.748 --> 19:48.376
My real name is
Pestario Rivera Garcia Espinoza...

19:48.451 --> 19:51.545
Juan Marcos Neruda Salsa Picante Vargas.

19:51.620 --> 19:55.249
But you can call me Pestario.
Pest, for shorter.

19:55.324 --> 19:56.757
Now we're even.

19:57.827 --> 20:01.422
What is a Latin boy doing
delivering Chinese food?

20:01.497 --> 20:03.089
Chinese food?

20:04.967 --> 20:07.026
Oh, my God!

20:07.103 --> 20:09.731
The MSG, the chopsticks,
the disappearing dogs!

20:09.805 --> 20:13.400
Now it all makes sense. And I thought
they were eccentric Mexicans.

20:13.476 --> 20:16.741
What a fool!
What a sucker-butt!

20:16.812 --> 20:20.908
Oh, a hot wench!
Yeah, baby!

20:20.983 --> 20:22.575
My wife!

20:22.651 --> 20:24.551
Oops! I'm bad.

20:24.620 --> 20:25.882
Sorry.

20:25.955 --> 20:29.948
- I saw you earlier today on the street.
- You did?

20:30.026 --> 20:34.759
You probably didn't see me
because you were blind at the time.

20:34.830 --> 20:38.926
So you unearthed my horrible secret.

20:39.001 --> 20:40.935
I am blind! I am!

20:41.003 --> 20:43.028
I am blind!

20:44.140 --> 20:46.631
I've been blind
to other people's faults.

20:46.709 --> 20:50.167
Please don't tell! I was going
to become dumpling boy next week.

20:50.246 --> 20:54.307
Why isn't a smart boy like you...

20:54.383 --> 20:55.850
in college?

20:55.918 --> 20:57.943
It's painful to discuss.

20:58.020 --> 21:00.614
I hit puberty in the first grade,
and there's only so many times...

21:00.689 --> 21:05.149
a seven-year-old can be called
"fire hose" before he cracks.

21:06.228 --> 21:10.756
That's really too bad because
my family provides...

21:10.833 --> 21:15.236
a $50,000 cash scholarship...

21:15.304 --> 21:17.272
to minority students,
and I thought...

21:17.339 --> 21:19.273
- $50,000?
- Yeah.

21:19.341 --> 21:21.832
- $50,000?
- Yup, that's it.

21:21.911 --> 21:24.641
Look at that.
Will you touch it?

21:24.713 --> 21:28.012
The fire hose is gone!
It's a miracle.

21:28.084 --> 21:31.850
Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!
I want to learn! I want to go to school!

21:31.921 --> 21:33.411
- You do?
- Yes.

21:33.489 --> 21:36.481
Good! I'm so glad you're so eager!

21:36.559 --> 21:38.925
Let us celebrate, all right?

21:38.994 --> 21:40.655
Here.

21:40.729 --> 21:46.224
Ofcourse I have to administer
a few small tests before you qualify.

21:46.302 --> 21:47.894
Tests?

21:50.406 --> 21:53.204
Hey, can I get one of these tables
for my dorm room?

21:53.275 --> 21:56.836
Turn it up!
This is fun. Come on.

21:56.912 --> 21:58.470
All right...

21:58.547 --> 22:00.845
crank it up.

22:03.352 --> 22:04.785
Yeah!

22:09.925 --> 22:11.893
Wait a minute.

22:11.961 --> 22:13.895
I don't feel so well.

22:13.963 --> 22:15.055
I feel...

22:20.402 --> 22:25.806
You will do as many repetitions
as you can manage in one minute. Go!

22:28.310 --> 22:29.743
One.

22:29.812 --> 22:31.074
Ready?

22:36.685 --> 22:38.550
I wasn't ready.
Try again.

22:42.024 --> 22:44.015
Try one more time.

22:57.206 --> 22:59.970
He's the worst candidate
we have ever had.

23:02.711 --> 23:06.374
I will show you the shot that won me
the reform school championship...

23:06.448 --> 23:08.916
and the tag "8-Ball Kid."

23:12.888 --> 23:16.085
I'm sorry.
I'm awful sorry.

23:16.158 --> 23:19.821
But I know you don't care
because you Germans are the greatest!

23:19.895 --> 23:22.762
Next time somebody says Germans
are humorless people...

23:22.831 --> 23:25.629
I'm gonna tell them to come
to this house.

23:25.701 --> 23:27.191
I must tell you...

23:27.269 --> 23:29.829
So you started a few wars,
all right?

23:29.905 --> 23:33.238
Actually, you started every war.
It's not like you ever won one!

23:35.277 --> 23:37.245
We kicked France's ass.

23:37.313 --> 23:39.873
Please! Who doesn't, right?

23:39.949 --> 23:42.110
Your scores were so abysmal that...

23:42.184 --> 23:45.153
And your women!
So you dig fat chicks.

23:45.221 --> 23:47.746
What do the rest of us care?
We don't have to touch them.

23:47.823 --> 23:52.624
It's like riding a moped. It's fun
till your friends catch you doing it.

23:52.695 --> 23:54.128
You failed!

23:54.196 --> 23:56.926
You lost the scholarship.
You can't go.

23:56.999 --> 23:58.990
Stop repeating what I'm saying.

23:59.068 --> 24:00.831
I mean it!

24:03.539 --> 24:05.473
All right, okay!

24:05.541 --> 24:09.910
You're the ideal candidate
for the scholarship.

24:16.185 --> 24:19.552
I am? I am? Oh, snap! Oh, joy!

24:19.622 --> 24:22.216
Get stupid. Get ooh-eh! Get eh-eh.

24:26.161 --> 24:29.927
I can't think of any thing I would rather
do before returning to the homeland...

24:29.999 --> 24:32.832
than ridding the earth
of this creature!

24:35.104 --> 24:37.504
Go get the contract.

24:40.576 --> 24:43.477
Time to sign the contract.

24:43.545 --> 24:46.912
Sign there on the dotted line.
Here.

24:50.753 --> 24:53.881
I took a legal correspondence course
and I'm only two credits away.

24:53.956 --> 24:57.323
What's all this stuff
about maiming and death?

24:57.393 --> 24:58.985
Legal mumbojumbo.

24:59.061 --> 25:00.460
All right.

25:00.529 --> 25:01.962
Just sign.

25:02.965 --> 25:06.992
What's this about "I waive
my legal rights" and what not?

25:07.069 --> 25:11.096
Some kid sued us last year over
a stubbed toe, so we had to add it.

25:11.173 --> 25:13.403
- Just sign.
- All right.

25:14.410 --> 25:15.934
What's this about...

25:16.011 --> 25:19.845
- So you don't want the $50,000.
- I do want it!

25:19.915 --> 25:22.008
- College is a big commitment.
- I'll be committed.

25:22.084 --> 25:25.019
- We'll give it to someone else.
- Give it to me.

25:25.087 --> 25:26.748
- I want it!
- Forget it!

25:26.822 --> 25:28.847
Perhaps a toast?

25:34.363 --> 25:36.126
I'm in like sin.

25:37.199 --> 25:40.225
Now, we have a little tradition.

25:40.302 --> 25:45.262
All the winners join me for a little
gentlemanly hunt on my private island.

25:45.341 --> 25:46.706
Goody. What'll we hunt?

25:46.775 --> 25:48.936
- Deer.
- Goose.

25:49.011 --> 25:50.842
- Goose.
- Deer.

25:50.913 --> 25:51.811
Deer goose.

25:51.880 --> 25:53.472
Ja. Deer goose.

25:53.549 --> 25:55.779
We hunt a deer goose.
It's...

25:55.851 --> 25:58.217
- Indigenous.
- Indigenous to my island.

25:58.954 --> 26:00.387
To the hunt!

26:06.562 --> 26:08.154
Sorry.

26:09.531 --> 26:10.964
Hurry up!

26:11.033 --> 26:13.593
I can't wait to bag me a deer goose!

26:13.669 --> 26:18.368
I hear the meat's a delicacy.
No body fricassees like I fricassee.

26:20.743 --> 26:24.907
- I'm going to kill him now!
- Remember, the joy of the hunt.

26:24.980 --> 26:28.177
- Can I fly it?
- No, sit down and be quiet.

26:28.250 --> 26:30.184
You can't talk to me like that.

26:30.252 --> 26:32.743
You gotta keep the concentration
for the pilot.

26:32.821 --> 26:34.755
He's the pilot?

26:48.871 --> 26:51.339
23,099 bottles of beer on the wall

26:51.407 --> 26:55.241
23,099 bottles of beer on the wall
Take one down, pass it around...

26:55.310 --> 26:57.972
- There's the island.
- We made it!

26:58.046 --> 27:00.378
At last! We're there!

27:01.450 --> 27:03.418
So you'll let me fly? Come on!

27:03.485 --> 27:07.012
There's so many buttons.
How do you know which one's the one?

27:09.458 --> 27:12.120
You Can Change for the hunt
in the study.

27:12.194 --> 27:13.821
Thank you.

27:13.896 --> 27:16.456
Try not to break any thing.

27:18.233 --> 27:20.997
"The United States of Germany."

27:21.069 --> 27:23.037
Somebody's a sore loser.

27:28.210 --> 27:30.701
Books! I love to read.

27:32.948 --> 27:36.645
"The Rise and Fall
of The Third Reich."

27:36.718 --> 27:38.686
" Mein Kampf."

27:38.754 --> 27:40.949
"Sex Be Nimble,
Sex Be Quick."

27:52.134 --> 27:54.261
You speak German?

28:00.108 --> 28:02.099
You're the new scholarship student.

28:02.177 --> 28:07.410
- I'm here for the hunt, then to Harvard.
- You really believe that?

28:07.483 --> 28:09.974
I would settle for Yale, but...

28:10.052 --> 28:12.247
I love Boston in the spring.

28:12.321 --> 28:15.722
Rowing on the Charles.
Gathering leaves in the quad.

28:15.791 --> 28:17.224
The color wars.

28:17.292 --> 28:19.726
Norman, is that you?

28:19.795 --> 28:22.628
My father tells you you're going
to college and you believe him?

28:22.698 --> 28:25.792
Oh, snap. You're Shank Junior, huh?

28:26.969 --> 28:29.028
My name is Himmel.

28:30.706 --> 28:32.640
I mean, hi, Himmel.

28:32.708 --> 28:35.472
Your father seems like a great guy
for a disturbed individual.

28:35.544 --> 28:37.535
No offense.
But I trust him.

28:37.613 --> 28:41.276
What makes you think he'd tell you
the truth when I am his own son...

28:41.350 --> 28:43.875
and he's been lying to me
his entire life?

28:46.522 --> 28:50.959
Well, it seems like the two of you
have issues to work out.

28:51.026 --> 28:52.960
I'm going to go outside.

28:53.028 --> 28:56.327
Do you know what he did to me
when I was a child?

28:56.398 --> 28:59.060
No, but why don't we get Leo
and tell him?

28:59.134 --> 29:01.625
He locked me in a room
with a boa constrictor...

29:01.703 --> 29:04.297
and told me I couldn't get out
until I killed it.

29:07.543 --> 29:12.207
The important thing is that you
got out and you're fine. You know?

29:12.281 --> 29:15.444
He kept me in that room for six weeks!

29:15.517 --> 29:17.985
But look at the wonderful
complexion you have.

29:18.053 --> 29:21.022
Don't be afraid.
I loved that snake.

29:21.089 --> 29:23.023
You share too much.

29:26.061 --> 29:27.085
Help.

29:33.869 --> 29:38.169
So tell me,
what was your snake's name?

29:38.240 --> 29:39.639
Cocteau.

29:39.708 --> 29:41.539
Cocteau?

29:41.610 --> 29:43.305
Like the French playwright?

29:44.413 --> 29:46.540
After my two favorite body parts.

29:53.422 --> 29:55.014
Red light, green light!

29:56.258 --> 29:57.953
Red light, green light!

30:01.363 --> 30:03.490
You're it.

30:04.733 --> 30:06.291
Gustav!

30:07.369 --> 30:10.532
Now we are locked in together,
like me and the snake.

30:10.606 --> 30:13.404
Oh, great!
Just great.

30:13.475 --> 30:15.443
Look, cute boy.

30:15.510 --> 30:19.139
- You seem like a reasonable type.
- Don't flatter me!

30:19.214 --> 30:23.207
You have a big nose, your feet stink
and your mother dresses you funny.

30:24.886 --> 30:26.854
There is no scholarship.

30:26.922 --> 30:29.982
You are only here
because my father wants to hunt you.

30:30.058 --> 30:32.549
My God, you'll say anything,
won't you?

30:32.628 --> 30:35.188
Now, how do you sound
your father wants to hunt me?

30:35.263 --> 30:39.859
Why would he give me this fancy
hunting out fit if he wanted to hunt me?

30:39.935 --> 30:42.529
- Explain yourself.
- I can protect you.

30:43.672 --> 30:45.105
Don't go!

30:52.314 --> 30:54.179
Oh, you play!

30:55.350 --> 30:56.351
Listen, I just met your crazy son.

30:56.351 --> 30:58.012
Listen, I just met your crazy son.

30:58.086 --> 30:59.781
No offense.

30:59.855 --> 31:05.691
He made up the wackest story about you
wanting to hunt me. You believe that?

31:06.828 --> 31:08.853
Ridiculous, isn't it?

31:08.930 --> 31:13.128
Can you imagine the demons that kid's
working out? You hunting people?

31:14.369 --> 31:17.964
My God. It would almost be funny
if it wasn't so...

31:19.875 --> 31:21.809
lfit wasn't so...

31:47.602 --> 31:50.969
This is the most disgusting thing...

31:51.039 --> 31:53.507
I have ever seen.

31:53.575 --> 31:56.305
Those heads haven't been dusted
in months!

31:57.412 --> 32:00.779
I'm going to get a wet rag
and I'll be right back. Bye.

32:05.353 --> 32:08.686
I don't wanna die!
I'm too young!

32:12.494 --> 32:15.122
Get off me, you freak!

32:15.197 --> 32:17.358
Want a piece of me?
Get a piece of me.

32:20.569 --> 32:22.036
My springbok pelt!

32:22.104 --> 32:24.971
I'm sorry. I couldn't make it
to the newspaper.

32:26.775 --> 32:30.836
- I bagged this on my ninth birthday.
- He was a prodigy.

32:30.912 --> 32:35.406
By the time I was 30, I had hunted
nearly every animal there was.

32:35.484 --> 32:39.386
Yeah? You won't be so  
when I report you to the ASPCA!

32:39.454 --> 32:41.388
- I was bored.
- Bored, sir?

32:41.456 --> 32:45.688
All right, so I was depressed!
I needed a challenge.

32:45.761 --> 32:49.788
Have you tried Parcheesi?
It's a game of skill and chance.

32:49.865 --> 32:54.495
Here on this island, I've hunted every
ethnicity of human except one.

32:54.569 --> 32:57.970
My God! Haven't the Jewish people
suffered enough?

32:58.039 --> 32:59.631
You are Puerto Rican?

32:59.708 --> 33:03.337
What, me? Oh, no.

33:09.918 --> 33:11.647
I am French!

33:22.964 --> 33:28.027
Look at me. I'm brooding,
yet craving rich sauces.

33:28.103 --> 33:30.594
You are next, Mr. Vargas.

33:32.140 --> 33:34.199
But I break out when I'm shell acked.

33:34.276 --> 33:36.870
What's more embarrassing
than a zitty head on the wall?

33:36.945 --> 33:38.344
Besides...

33:38.413 --> 33:42.747
I'll make a nasty face,
and I'll destroy your display.

33:44.853 --> 33:49.586
lf you survive for 24 hours,
you get your $50,000.

33:50.659 --> 33:52.456
$50,000?

33:52.527 --> 33:54.791
My God!
Why didn't you say so?

33:54.863 --> 33:57.195
Hunt away, great white hunter!

33:57.265 --> 33:59.062
Hunt...

33:59.134 --> 34:00.795
Hunt away.

34:00.869 --> 34:03.736
And if you don't, it's the shelf.

34:11.313 --> 34:14.646
Father, I don't want
to participate in this. It's wrong.

34:14.716 --> 34:16.775
You have to learn sometime.

34:16.851 --> 34:20.514
Why would I ever have to learn
how to hunt people?

34:20.589 --> 34:23.251
The hunt is just a metaphor...

34:23.324 --> 34:28.319
for the glorious cycle
of endless life and rebirth.

34:28.396 --> 34:33.094
And remember, always, always
shoot him in the brain.

34:33.168 --> 34:35.101
- I hate you.
- Shut up.

34:35.170 --> 34:37.730
I'm getting more tea.

34:37.806 --> 34:42.766
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me, but...

34:44.079 --> 34:46.411
Why do I look like
I'm from the "Jungle Book"...

34:46.481 --> 34:49.348
and you get the nice
Banana Republic stuff?

34:49.417 --> 34:51.351
Does that seem fair to you?

34:51.418 --> 34:55.583
I thought you'd like it.
It's the costume of your ancestors.

34:55.657 --> 34:59.184
- Mywhat?
- I think it adds a the atrical element.

34:59.261 --> 35:01.559
Stay out of this.

35:01.630 --> 35:06.033
I want some boots, some khakis,
some turtlenecks and some...

35:07.269 --> 35:10.102
You have guns.
That's not fair.

35:10.171 --> 35:14.540
I'm not going to play till
I get something. I can't hear you.

35:17.812 --> 35:19.473
- This is it?
- Yeah!

35:19.547 --> 35:22.448
- This is it?
- All yours!

35:22.517 --> 35:26.977
Oh, well, well. Why don't we just get
a candlestick and play Clue?

35:27.055 --> 35:29.114
I'll be Colonel Mustard.
You be Mrs. Peacock.

35:29.190 --> 35:33.684
First we start with
a traditional toast.

35:35.130 --> 35:37.530
To you, Mr. Vargas. Good luck.

35:37.599 --> 35:39.396
Good luck to you, too.

35:39.467 --> 35:42.163
Actually, I take that back.
I hope you don't do well.

35:42.237 --> 35:45.866
I hope you get violated
by pig-monkey men in the woods.

35:53.815 --> 35:58.252
All right, I've got the upper hand.
What's to keep me from shooting you now?

36:02.924 --> 36:04.721
Other than that.

36:05.894 --> 36:07.828
What are you doing?

36:12.100 --> 36:15.263
Your 24 hours have begun. Go.

36:15.337 --> 36:17.828
- I have one thing to add.
- What?

36:17.906 --> 36:22.400
I lied on the form. I'm not
the perfect specimen I appear to be.

36:22.477 --> 36:28.006
I have the public school gypsy curse.
Stuttering dyslexia.

36:28.083 --> 36:30.278
I b-bead r-rackwards.

36:30.352 --> 36:32.843
I g-get mords wixed up.

36:32.921 --> 36:35.116
I'm narcoleptic.

36:38.093 --> 36:40.687
And you are?
See? See?

36:40.762 --> 36:42.696
I have Tourette's!

36:42.764 --> 36:46.222
Yes, nice German. Freak! Weirdo!

36:48.970 --> 36:51.029
Those things don't grow on trees!

36:53.875 --> 36:57.606
I'm scared of you! I'll come back
when you're feeling better.

37:22.637 --> 37:26.573
Think, Pest. Think, think, think!
Think, old buddy.

37:26.641 --> 37:31.305
Your people came from the rain forest.
You must've inherited some skills.

37:40.121 --> 37:42.282
Now I'm nice and limber.

38:21.062 --> 38:23.189
That's more like it.

38:23.264 --> 38:26.665
My animalistical instincts
are finally kicking in.

38:31.206 --> 38:37.008
Himmel, when we find him,
I want you to make the kill.

38:38.980 --> 38:41.278
I don't want to make the kill.

38:41.349 --> 38:43.408
I want to be a hairdresser,
write musicals.

38:44.786 --> 38:47.653
- What?
- You'd love it if it were true.

38:47.722 --> 38:51.988
You'd tell your friends about your
hairdresser son who listens to Merman.

38:54.129 --> 38:57.394
Will you look at the size
of that snake?

38:59.767 --> 39:03.032
You and your snake obsession!

39:03.104 --> 39:08.303
lf you don't like it, may be you should
not have locked me in with a snake.

39:08.376 --> 39:10.606
Are you on that again?

39:10.678 --> 39:14.444
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to bore you
with my life's defining trauma.

39:16.084 --> 39:18.245
It's not dry enough.

39:21.256 --> 39:23.884
I can never please him.

39:29.030 --> 39:31.464
Something is wrong.

39:31.533 --> 39:35.025
What could be wrong?
We're hunting a human being.

39:35.103 --> 39:38.504
Other fathers take their sons
to baseball games, but...

39:38.573 --> 39:40.507
Tell it to Ricky Lake.

39:40.575 --> 39:44.944
I can see it now. " Nazi Fathers
and Their Snake-Obsessed Sons."

39:46.014 --> 39:48.414
What is this?

40:01.162 --> 40:02.595
Get me down.

40:02.664 --> 40:05.360
This Pest is good.

40:05.433 --> 40:08.800
- Get me down!
- Don't be such a sissy!

40:08.870 --> 40:12.533
I don't know ifyou've noticed lately,
but I am a sissy!

40:14.976 --> 40:17.911
- Whatyou doin'?
- Putting you out ofyour misery.

40:19.480 --> 40:20.913
Come on.

40:26.487 --> 40:29.320
- Doyou hear that moaning?
- It's me.

40:29.390 --> 40:31.585
No, the other moaning.

40:39.167 --> 40:41.158
My stomach is funky.

40:42.470 --> 40:44.529
Thank God for some privacy.

40:46.741 --> 40:49.710
- My back hurts where the tree hit me.
- Quiet.

40:52.747 --> 40:55.841
"Whether 'tis nobler in the mind...

40:55.917 --> 40:59.318
to suffer the slings and arrows...

40:59.387 --> 41:01.753
ofoutrageous fortune..."

41:03.258 --> 41:05.453
Scat. Shoo.

41:05.526 --> 41:08.154
I can't concentrate
when I'm being watched.

41:09.530 --> 41:12.158
I farted. Doyou think
I smell like this all the time?

41:15.737 --> 41:18.001
What's that smell?

41:21.009 --> 41:23.034
Look. There.

41:24.579 --> 41:26.046
My horoscope.

41:26.114 --> 41:28.207
" Beware ofstrangers offering...

41:28.283 --> 41:31.218
phony scholarships."

41:31.286 --> 41:35.382
Guess I'll have to use my socks.
At least they're soft.

41:37.325 --> 41:40.089
I wantyou to take him out.

41:40.161 --> 41:41.685
Why me?

41:41.763 --> 41:45.722
I wantyou to experience
the utter ecstasy that comes...

41:45.800 --> 41:49.896
from feeling the hot, throbbing force
ofa man's life...

41:49.971 --> 41:51.905
when it's in your hands.

41:51.973 --> 41:53.440
- Poison darts?
- Perfect.

41:53.508 --> 41:55.339
Just a second. Oops.

42:06.120 --> 42:07.553
Himmel!

42:17.865 --> 42:19.730
What a mess!

42:19.801 --> 42:22.668
The explosion blew him
right out ofhis sneakers.

42:24.105 --> 42:26.369
Looks like your hunt is over.

42:26.441 --> 42:29.535
I'm going back to the house
before I miss Hogan's Heroes.

42:40.788 --> 42:42.756
He's alive.

42:42.824 --> 42:46.624
Colonel Hogan, would you join us
for dinner tonight?

42:46.694 --> 42:48.889
Colonel Baker is 0going to tell us
the truth...

42:48.963 --> 42:52.126
about the German army's glorious
Campaign on the Russian front.

42:52.200 --> 42:54.794
Why kill all your appetites?

43:07.615 --> 43:10.607
Pest, you're supposed to be dead!

43:10.685 --> 43:12.676
I can't.

43:12.754 --> 43:14.449
I won't.

43:14.522 --> 43:15.955
I shouldn't.

43:17.759 --> 43:19.727
All right, I will.

43:19.794 --> 43:24.390
- You've got to be quiet.
- You! You!

43:24.465 --> 43:27.923
You tried to hunt me.

43:29.704 --> 43:31.137
Get back!

43:31.205 --> 43:33.696
What are you trying to do,
perfume me to death?

43:33.775 --> 43:36.073
These are sex secretion pheromones.

43:36.144 --> 43:38.772
Father uses them
to lure horny animals into traps.

43:38.846 --> 43:41.212
Here. Watch the tape.

43:44.952 --> 43:47.420
This is disgusting.

43:49.056 --> 43:53.288
I'm gonna take some of these
for my girlfriend.

43:53.361 --> 43:56.159
She hates when I go away
and don't bring her nothing.

43:56.230 --> 43:58.664
They only work on males.
Can I fix you one?

43:58.733 --> 44:00.792
No, you've done enough for one day.

44:00.868 --> 44:03.496
You're mad we tried
to cut your head off?

44:03.571 --> 44:08.008
I'm not mad.
Do I look mad to you?

44:10.244 --> 44:14.704
I know you're not into
all this Wild Kingdom stuff.

44:14.782 --> 44:17.842
So why don't you and I
escape back to Miami...

44:17.919 --> 44:21.616
get away from your crazy, ugly,
psychotic father, no offense...

44:21.689 --> 44:26.388
and you and I will play snakey-wakey
whenever you want to.

44:26.461 --> 44:27.894
Really?

44:27.962 --> 44:29.486
C-Certainly.

44:32.166 --> 44:36.125
- We'll takeyour father's speed boat.
- I get sea sick.

44:36.204 --> 44:37.728
You'll be fine.

44:53.321 --> 44:56.222
I told you, I get sea sick.

44:56.290 --> 44:58.315
Well, no duh!

44:59.927 --> 45:03.090
- What are those seagulls doing?
- They've come to eat your vomit.

45:04.699 --> 45:06.963
Will you stop that?

45:07.034 --> 45:10.800
Fine. But I'd watch out
for the seagullses if l was you.

45:11.772 --> 45:12.796
Why?

45:14.108 --> 45:16.872
- I'll be leaving now.
- It stings.

45:16.944 --> 45:18.639
I'm blind!

45:18.713 --> 45:20.681
Pest, where'd you go?

45:23.284 --> 45:26.378
My father's gonna kill me!

45:32.560 --> 45:34.926
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

45:34.996 --> 45:37.897
You know the reputation about
Latino men, right?

45:37.965 --> 45:41.867
They didn't have any Latino man
on the show because everybody knows...

45:41.936 --> 45:46.339
that he would be having his way
with Ginger, MaryAnn, Mrs. Howell...

45:46.407 --> 45:48.375
and the Professor.

45:48.442 --> 45:52.378
Then let me ask you a question. Lf you
had to choose, who would you pick?

45:52.446 --> 45:54.175
MaryAnn or Ginger?

45:55.550 --> 45:57.074
Ginger. No contest.

46:00.688 --> 46:03.418
- Is that you, man?
- Are you all right?

46:03.491 --> 46:05.482
What happened?

46:05.560 --> 46:07.585
I can't go on.

46:07.662 --> 46:11.996
Must have dry land.
Oh, dry land!

46:12.066 --> 46:14.193
- You okay?
- What happened?

46:14.268 --> 46:16.702
What happened? Oh, God!

46:16.771 --> 46:18.705
The room is spinning!

46:20.107 --> 46:24.635
What happened? What happened?
I'll tell you what happened.

46:27.915 --> 46:30.383
Contract.
"I want to hunt you."

46:30.451 --> 46:34.717
And his son.
" Pet my snake."

46:36.157 --> 46:39.490
" Playmate, come out and play."
Seagulls!

46:39.560 --> 46:44.156
He made doody-doody. It was horrible.
Don't let them take me back.

46:45.700 --> 46:47.691
What are you saying?

46:47.768 --> 46:51.864
Listen. Take a swim in the pool.
It'll helpyou relax.

46:51.939 --> 46:53.372
- Trust me.
- A swim?

46:53.441 --> 46:58.003
- A splash.
- Obviously, you haven't been listening!

46:58.079 --> 47:03.449
I've been swimming for five hours!
What don't you understand?

47:07.355 --> 47:09.220
Maybe one lap?

47:12.493 --> 47:16.725
Then there were 20 of them.
Did I say 20? I meant an army.

47:16.797 --> 47:19.163
Don't be faking jacks.

47:19.233 --> 47:23.533
- There's no scammification going on.
- You're not being hunted.

47:23.604 --> 47:26.164
- I am too being hunted.
- Are not.

47:26.240 --> 47:28.174
- Am too.
- Am not.

47:35.516 --> 47:39.213
See? See? I told you.
I am being hunted.

47:39.286 --> 47:42.050
Give up, Pest!
There's no where to hide.

47:42.123 --> 47:46.856
Thank the Lord,
he's here to kill me!

47:49.030 --> 47:51.760
Snap. Run!

47:56.871 --> 47:59.237
That guy's psycho.
Why is he after you?

47:59.306 --> 48:02.639
I don't know.
Must be my animal magnetism.

48:02.710 --> 48:05.543
Get in. Let's go!
Let's get the hell out of here.

48:09.250 --> 48:12.276
I told you I was being hunted.
Did you believe me? No.

48:12.353 --> 48:16.153
- Because no one ever believes me.
- We believe you. Who's got the plan?

48:16.223 --> 48:19.784
- Okay, I got the master plan.
- Kick it.

48:19.860 --> 48:23.387
- Remember my cousin Roger?
- The mad fool?

48:23.464 --> 48:27.457
The mad cool guy. We could go to
his place and lay low till morning.

48:27.535 --> 48:30.834
- Perfect. I can't.
- What?

48:30.905 --> 48:34.636
We gotta make one, stupid,
meaningless stop.

48:34.709 --> 48:36.142
Where, Pest?

48:36.210 --> 48:38.838
No place special.
Xantha's.

48:40.247 --> 48:43.273
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm in love.

48:43.350 --> 48:45.944
I'm sure her parents will understand...

48:46.020 --> 48:49.183
if you explain tonight's not good
as you're being hunted.

48:49.256 --> 48:53.625
- They're black. They'll understand.
- Yeah?

48:54.862 --> 48:56.853
What's up, freak?

48:58.866 --> 49:00.458
It's me.

49:01.836 --> 49:05.237
You better recognize, baby.
You act like...

49:05.306 --> 49:10.972
Yo, Mrs. Kent. I'm not sweating you,
but you're one fine heifer.

49:11.045 --> 49:14.276
What's up, Mack Daddy?

49:14.348 --> 49:17.249
Kill whitey. Free Angela Davis.
Say it loud. " Be black and be proud."

49:17.318 --> 49:21.254
- Yes, Lord!
- Why don't we go in here?

49:21.322 --> 49:24.553
That boy's on drugs.
Who's Angela Davis?

49:24.625 --> 49:28.686
All the cars you could get,
why did you pick this one?

49:28.763 --> 49:31.197
I thought you'd like it.
It's German.

49:31.265 --> 49:33.961
Did you ever hear of BMW, idiot?

49:34.034 --> 49:36.730
I'm sorry I can never please you!

49:36.804 --> 49:41.366
Shh. I'm getting something.
Here, have a look.

49:41.442 --> 49:45.742
The tracking device I placed in
his underwear seems to be working.

49:45.813 --> 49:49.044
Why does Leo get
all the good jobs?

49:49.116 --> 49:52.176
We have a fix on him, sir.
Go west!

49:54.822 --> 49:57.655
What's with
the African get up?

49:57.725 --> 50:00.319
All this is for you,
Xantha-poo.

50:00.394 --> 50:03.261
I'm trying to impressify
your parents.

50:03.330 --> 50:08.063
Does it scare  you that I arouse
the passions of the Dark Continent?

50:13.274 --> 50:16.038
It scares me that
you're wearing a dress to dinner.

50:16.110 --> 50:18.874
This is nothing compared
to my morning ensemble.

50:18.946 --> 50:22.074
How about a little kiss?
Come on, suck face.

50:23.050 --> 50:26.508
Well, I've prepared
an authentic Cuban meal.

50:26.587 --> 50:29.249
Platanos e frijos losnegros.

50:31.926 --> 50:33.291
Why Cuban?

50:33.360 --> 50:39.094
Do I look Cuban to you? Do these
look like Cuban features toyou?

50:39.166 --> 50:42.294
What does a brother have to do to
get some respect around here, bitch?

50:43.771 --> 50:48.731
I'm this close to rioting. This close.
lf l wasn't so hungry, I'd leave.

50:49.543 --> 50:51.704
Will you pass me
the platanos, please?

50:52.980 --> 50:55.540
Something's gone wrong
with the location tracker.

50:55.616 --> 50:58.050
It seems to be overheating.

51:00.387 --> 51:03.220
Honey, are you all right?
You're dripping wet.

51:04.859 --> 51:07.589
It's from being next to you.
I'm burning up with passion.

51:07.661 --> 51:09.561
Know what I'm saying?

51:09.630 --> 51:13.293
- Don't act like you haven't been there.
- Not lately.

51:14.902 --> 51:17.393
I think it's burning out.

51:19.273 --> 51:22.140
That bastard's gonads are sweating.

51:22.209 --> 51:25.007
Boost the power!

51:30.217 --> 51:31.650
I'm burnin' up!

51:33.020 --> 51:36.786
I told the guy at Africans 'R' Us
that I wanted summer weight robes.

51:36.857 --> 51:38.688
Drugs.

51:38.759 --> 51:42.195
It burns! Oh, my God, it burns!
It's burning!

51:48.369 --> 51:49.631
It burns!

51:50.671 --> 51:53.538
That boy's got syphilis!

51:56.577 --> 51:59.444
Don't be cruel!
Get 'em off me!

52:16.764 --> 52:20.723
lf you was abducted
by a space alien chick...

52:20.801 --> 52:25.500
would you or would you not
have your way with her?

52:28.242 --> 52:31.678
Before it cut off,
the signal came from this house.

52:31.745 --> 52:35.237
I'm going in there.
You two stay here.

52:35.316 --> 52:39.116
Here, Mr. Shank,
I have prepared a dosage...

52:39.186 --> 52:42.212
which will immediately
render him unconscious.

52:42.289 --> 52:44.985
Then we can take him with us...

52:45.059 --> 52:47.721
und at our leisure,
cut off his head.

52:47.795 --> 52:50.855
Leo, you're a saint.

52:50.931 --> 52:52.626
Be careful, sir.

52:54.768 --> 52:57.430
These Volkswagens are smaller
than they used to be.

52:57.504 --> 52:59.199
Check it out.

52:59.273 --> 53:03.937
She's got the body parts
of a hot Earth woman.

53:12.486 --> 53:15.455
Fear not, the Pest line
shall continue.

53:15.522 --> 53:18.514
My childrens
have been saved.

53:18.592 --> 53:20.457
Yeah!

53:20.527 --> 53:25.464
That'll teach me not to spring for
extra-strength fungus spray. You know?

53:28.369 --> 53:30.394
Look, man.
Look over there.

53:32.840 --> 53:35.104
That's Colonel Klink!

53:35.175 --> 53:37.769
He's climbing through
Xantha's window, man!

53:37.845 --> 53:39.779
Wait here. I'll be right back.

53:39.847 --> 53:41.542
Karate time.

53:42.683 --> 53:44.173
Mrs. Kent, my sister.

53:44.251 --> 53:47.015
Let me explain the origins
of my blackness one more time.

53:47.087 --> 53:51.421
My Spanish ancestors came and
had sex with my Indian ancestors.

53:51.492 --> 53:54.290
And then they had sex
with my black ancestors.

53:54.361 --> 53:57.091
Who then had more sex
with the Indians.

53:57.164 --> 54:00.964
And there's rumor that somebody
slept with aJew. Fancy that!

54:07.074 --> 54:10.669
Mrs. Kent, it's kosher. It's all right.
He was an Ethiopian Jew.

54:13.747 --> 54:17.239
I can't find my pills anywhere!

54:17.317 --> 54:20.582
You know how white people's food
gives me gas!

54:20.654 --> 54:22.588
What happened?

54:22.656 --> 54:25.420
What did you do to my family?

54:25.492 --> 54:28.325
I don't know. I mentioned I might
be prone to celebrate Rosh Hashanah...

54:28.395 --> 54:31.330
and, bam, prejudice rears
his ugly head again!

54:35.736 --> 54:38.830
Oh, I see, you're gonna try
and kill me. Try it, because...

54:43.243 --> 54:46.542
Could I do that again? I was looking
through the wrong thing.

54:48.615 --> 54:51.448
You're a pretty lousy shot
for a criminal.

54:51.518 --> 54:52.485
Hello.

55:03.630 --> 55:05.564
Any more surprises?

55:06.633 --> 55:08.601
Don't!

55:08.669 --> 55:10.762
I really hate you.

55:14.141 --> 55:17.076
Let's just get
this little game over, shall we?

55:21.815 --> 55:23.806
You missed me!

55:23.884 --> 55:27.479
You Can't hit me
You'reabigsuCker-butt

55:29.256 --> 55:31.247
ICan't believe you're German

55:47.141 --> 55:51.009
Where were you? Where the hell
were you when I needed you?

55:51.078 --> 55:53.046
I am so glad you're here.
Check it.

55:53.113 --> 55:56.947
Would you or would you not
have sex with a space alien chick?

55:57.017 --> 55:57.949
What?

56:02.589 --> 56:05.524
We have no way
of tracking him anymore.

56:05.592 --> 56:08.220
Just shut up!
Give me the phone.

56:10.330 --> 56:11.763
Hello?

56:11.832 --> 56:16.132
Oh, yo!
What's up, yo? Listen up.

56:16.203 --> 56:20.264
I got the 4-1-1 on Pest Vargas,
mamasita.

56:20.340 --> 56:25.505
- Who is this?
- This is the bum and all that.

56:25.579 --> 56:27.274
Listen.

56:27.347 --> 56:31.443
The word up is that Pest Vargas
has goosed your nugget...

56:31.518 --> 56:34.885
and is gonna skip the foot
in the morning, homey.

56:34.955 --> 56:36.923
Why are you telling me this?
What's he done to you?

56:36.990 --> 56:42.394
Well, he called my mother
a big, fat Scottish slut.

56:42.462 --> 56:44.453
We'll take care of it.

56:45.999 --> 56:49.901
Fellas, put all the men out
on the street looking for the Pest.

56:49.970 --> 56:52.268
He's out there somewhere
and I wanna find him.

56:52.339 --> 56:54.705
They're putting the word out.

56:56.276 --> 57:00.235
I'll be able to monitor
all their incoming calls.

57:00.314 --> 57:03.579
So, we'll know where he is
as soon as they do.

57:14.761 --> 57:17.958
We gotta find a place to hide.
I'm serious!

57:18.031 --> 57:20.522
Where's the last place
Gustav would think of looking?

57:20.601 --> 57:24.037
- Think! Use your head!
- All right! Calm down!

57:25.606 --> 57:28.040
Yo, Pest.
Check it out.

57:30.944 --> 57:33.674
Oh, no. Oh, no!

57:34.481 --> 57:37.279
Hello, Jews!

57:39.453 --> 57:41.387
Nobody's gonna see us here.
What are you...

57:46.760 --> 57:52.528
Shalom! And mazol tov,
my little gefiltes and yentas.

57:52.599 --> 57:54.965
And you are?

57:55.035 --> 57:57.697
I am a meshuggener,
but of course.

57:57.771 --> 58:02.799
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Rabbi Vargassteenstine.

58:02.876 --> 58:05.470
And this is
my farChadat associate...

58:05.545 --> 58:10.073
Rabbi Chubby Bergbaumsteenstein.

58:10.150 --> 58:14.519
Yes, I know! He's an Ethiopian Jew
from Ethiopia, of course.

58:14.588 --> 58:16.249
Really?
Where in Ethiopia?

58:16.323 --> 58:18.814
Yo, man, I'm from South Bay, bro...

58:18.892 --> 58:21.417
Unfortunately, the Lord saw fit
to take away his voice box.

58:21.495 --> 58:24.123
But he has a canasta game
to die for.

58:24.197 --> 58:27.997
We'd like to stay, but I got a pain
in my tchotchke. I gotta go.

58:29.436 --> 58:33.338
Angus, I think
I've found our man.

58:34.541 --> 58:38.807
Sir, look. It seems our Latino
has found religion.

58:38.879 --> 58:41.370
He appears to be leaving
a synagogue.

58:45.852 --> 58:49.310
So, funny looking,
got any more genius ideas?

58:49.389 --> 58:51.550
Yo, man.
I'll pick another place.

58:51.625 --> 58:54.116
No, thanks.
I'm pickin' the place.

58:54.194 --> 58:57.459
Right here at the Paris Club.
There's a private party going on.

58:57.531 --> 58:59.465
I'll pull into the parking lot.

59:05.072 --> 59:07.700
Hey, yo!
It's all lovely.

59:07.774 --> 59:10.800
I hear there's
a mad-sick party going on.

59:10.877 --> 59:12.868
Can you hook up a brother
and his brother?

59:12.946 --> 59:17.610
Mad?
Dude, parties are never mad.

59:17.684 --> 59:19.413
They're angry! Duh!

59:20.220 --> 59:22.120
The thing is...

59:22.189 --> 59:25.124
this is a private party, Cheech!

59:26.126 --> 59:27.559
I can't believe this.

59:27.627 --> 59:30.187
Seriously, I bet you could
get in the servants' entrance.

59:31.832 --> 59:35.290
- You guys are harsh!
- Yeah, you guys are harsh!

59:35.369 --> 59:37.303
Actually, you guys suck.

59:38.839 --> 59:42.275
- Yo, chumps, get stupid.
- I can get stupid.

59:42.342 --> 59:44.970
You know what to do.
Spank 'em, brother!

59:45.045 --> 59:47.570
Let's party!

59:47.647 --> 59:50.309
Go, white boy!
Go, white boy!

59:50.384 --> 59:51.749
Crank it, dude!

01:00:26.753 --> 01:00:29.779
Wanna make its way, Make it say
How do you like that, baby

01:00:30.857 --> 01:00:34.452
Spank and napping till this happened
Spank it all around

01:00:35.996 --> 01:00:38.021
How do you like that, baby

01:00:43.570 --> 01:00:46.130
How do you like that, baby

01:00:50.644 --> 01:00:52.839
Spank it

01:01:22.209 --> 01:01:25.076
Oh, snap.
This one fainted.

01:01:25.145 --> 01:01:28.410
I'm not gonna let you have any white
people unless you take care of them.

01:01:32.385 --> 01:01:35.183
Shall we go clubbing,
or shall we go clubbing?

01:01:35.255 --> 01:01:37.450
Yeah, let's go clubbing.

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:49.191
There's a party over here!

01:01:50.337 --> 01:01:53.033
Pest and Chub in the house!

01:01:53.106 --> 01:01:56.234
So good, baby.
You know how it is.

01:01:56.309 --> 01:02:01.337
- Oh, snap. Is that one of Angus's men?
- What's he doing here?

01:02:01.414 --> 01:02:04.645
Let's not wait to find out.
Let's Houdini outta here.

01:02:07.654 --> 01:02:11.454
Plaid every where!
Plaid here, plaid there.

01:02:11.525 --> 01:02:14.756
- I need reinforcements. Call Ninja.
- Ninga, for reinforcements?

01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:24.932
Hello?

01:02:27.007 --> 01:02:28.440
Wakey, wakey.

01:02:28.508 --> 01:02:30.442
Do you realize that
while you'r enapping...

01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:33.274
your bestest of friends
are being stalked?

01:02:33.346 --> 01:02:34.745
That's nice.

01:02:34.814 --> 01:02:36.281
How's my Xantha-poo?

01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:39.648
A tranquilizer dart is in her butt.

01:02:39.719 --> 01:02:41.846
Thank God!
That'll suck up all the poison.

01:02:41.922 --> 01:02:45.790
We need you to Come to the Paris Club
like right now.

01:02:45.859 --> 01:02:48.919
Meet us in the Karaoke Room.
Later, masturbator.

01:02:51.097 --> 01:02:52.530
Hi, there!

01:02:56.603 --> 01:02:59.037
- Hey, big guy.
- Excuse me.

01:02:59.105 --> 01:03:03.508
We gotta split up and find Vargas
before the Scottish gentlemen do.

01:03:03.577 --> 01:03:05.010
Split up.

01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:08.813
See ya.

01:03:14.087 --> 01:03:17.454
- Have you seen a little Latin boy?
- This is the models' changing room!

01:03:17.524 --> 01:03:20.823
- Get out of my face!
- What do you think you're doing?

01:03:22.162 --> 01:03:23.652
Excuse me.

01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:25.664
Excuse me. Good day.

01:03:25.732 --> 01:03:30.431
I'm gonna get Ninja in the Karaoke Room
and meet you in the Jeep.

01:03:30.503 --> 01:03:31.936
Go for it.

01:03:37.744 --> 01:03:39.541
Sorry, sorry.

01:04:04.904 --> 01:04:09.432
Got a lifetime to share

01:04:09.509 --> 01:04:13.411
So muCh to say

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:16.677
For only time

01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:18.411
My God, you suck!

01:04:18.485 --> 01:04:20.885
I'm not just saying it lightly.
You really suck!

01:04:20.954 --> 01:04:23.218
I wanna put a hot poker
through my ears!

01:04:23.289 --> 01:04:26.349
What'd you do with your singing les...
Get off me. You don't know me.

01:04:26.426 --> 01:04:28.394
- Let me show you to a chair.
- Don't show me nothing.

01:04:28.461 --> 01:04:30.986
Show me the way outta here.

01:04:31.064 --> 01:04:33.692
- Goodness gracious!
- Good show, ja?

01:04:34.501 --> 01:04:37.095
Ja, is a good show.

01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:39.138
Could you go away, little man?
You bother me.

01:04:39.205 --> 01:04:42.140
- He wants a tip.
- A tip? Why didn't you say so?

01:04:42.208 --> 01:04:45.268
You buy Honda stock. Okay, get away.
Your breath smells.

01:04:45.345 --> 01:04:48.337
He's so too sucky.
I can't...

01:04:52.185 --> 01:04:53.618
Ninja! Ninja!

01:04:57.323 --> 01:05:01.123
- Ninja. I am a Ninja warrior.
- Really!

01:05:01.194 --> 01:05:03.162
Who would like to be next?

01:05:03.229 --> 01:05:04.594
Don't be shy.

01:05:04.664 --> 01:05:06.427
All right, sir.

01:05:06.499 --> 01:05:09.400
- Come on up.
- You go.

01:05:11.037 --> 01:05:13.505
Don't be bashful.
Come up.

01:05:13.573 --> 01:05:17.168
You make mistake.
I go. No, I can't.

01:05:17.243 --> 01:05:21.612
- Come on up.
- I can, I can.

01:05:21.681 --> 01:05:23.774
All right!

01:05:23.850 --> 01:05:26.410
I was hoping to see my family.
Shoguns and all that.

01:05:28.154 --> 01:05:30.122
It's a dangerous crowd out there.

01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:32.954
Which Karaoke selection
are you going to do?

01:05:33.026 --> 01:05:35.961
- What selections do we have today?
- They're on the monitor.

01:05:39.099 --> 01:05:42.159
"TV Favorites." Why not? Okay.

01:05:42.235 --> 01:05:46.365
All right, TV Favorites.
Take it away.

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.174
I didn't know they had words
to this!

01:05:49.242 --> 01:05:52.439
We got a right to piCk
a little fight, Bonanza

01:05:52.512 --> 01:05:56.471
lf any one fights any one
He's got to fight with me

01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:59.450
I might want to saddle up
in one Bonanza

01:05:59.519 --> 01:06:01.180
What are you doing?

01:06:01.254 --> 01:06:04.052
I'm taking a break.

01:06:04.124 --> 01:06:06.149
- One for four, Four fo rone
- You suck!

01:06:06.226 --> 01:06:09.957
No, you suck! I kick your...
PiCka little fight Bonanza

01:06:10.029 --> 01:06:13.760
Do you recognize
the little Japanese guy?

01:06:13.833 --> 01:06:15.960
- No.
- You sure?

01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:22.674
Thank you very much.

01:06:22.742 --> 01:06:27.202
That is Pest Vargas,
you idiot!

01:06:28.982 --> 01:06:33.146
I'm going to sing another song,
something from my childhood.

01:06:37.056 --> 01:06:39.388
You annoying  little weasel,
Pest Vargas!

01:06:39.459 --> 01:06:42.917
You a big irritate, round eye.
I am not Pest.

01:06:43.730 --> 01:06:47.530
I am Uni Wasabi.

01:06:49.335 --> 01:06:54.068
I had the pleasure of hunting Uni
Wasabi, and you are no Uni Wasabi.

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:55.573
I am too!

01:06:58.344 --> 01:07:01.541
Perhaps this
will help you decide.

01:07:01.614 --> 01:07:04.276
Perhaps this...

01:07:04.350 --> 01:07:07.080
will helpyou decide.

01:07:09.689 --> 01:07:13.284
You defend yourself
with a punyvile of cat piss?

01:07:13.359 --> 01:07:16.795
- Leo, go get him.
- It's the sex pheromones.

01:07:18.932 --> 01:07:20.524
Gustav...

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:24.263
I find myself
strangely drawn to you.

01:07:24.337 --> 01:07:26.931
- Father, I feel funny.
- What?

01:07:32.111 --> 01:07:34.773
Let me at him.

01:07:34.848 --> 01:07:37.681
You horny dog.
I should've had you fixed.

01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:39.274
Let me go.

01:07:39.352 --> 01:07:42.844
I didn't know you could sing.

01:07:42.922 --> 01:07:45.186
Stick with me, son, and I'll learn ya.

01:07:45.258 --> 01:07:48.489
- Where's Gustav?
- He's meeting some new people.

01:07:48.561 --> 01:07:51.496
- Let's go.
- I think you should come with us.

01:07:51.564 --> 01:07:55.125
No, thanks. My mother said
never to go with strangers.

01:07:55.201 --> 01:07:58.261
But you seem nice.

01:08:03.376 --> 01:08:07.244
Pest, Pest, Pest,
you're a great disappointment.

01:08:07.313 --> 01:08:11.249
You thought I was gonna be taller?
I get that a lot, don't I?

01:08:11.317 --> 01:08:14.115
Why don't you do that impression
I like so much?

01:08:14.187 --> 01:08:18.317
I don't want to. The Italians
never make me do impressions.

01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:21.484
- Do it.
- Captain, I cannot do it.

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:24.758
The dilithium crystals are breaking up.
She's gonna blow.

01:08:35.675 --> 01:08:36.868
Not so fast.

01:08:38.243 --> 01:08:39.801
Where's my money?

01:08:39.879 --> 01:08:42.814
Look, I'll have the money...
What's the day after today?

01:08:42.881 --> 01:08:44.941
- Tomorrow.
- My word is my bond.

01:08:45.018 --> 01:08:46.952
I don't trust your word.

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:50.751
Okay. Then...

01:08:50.823 --> 01:08:55.385
take as collateral that which is
the most precious to me in the world.

01:08:55.461 --> 01:08:58.658
And what would that be,
Mr. Vargas?

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.969
It's my best friend...

01:09:06.406 --> 01:09:08.169
Ninja.

01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:12.143
Pest, don't leave me!
They've got skirts!

01:09:13.313 --> 01:09:15.542
Don't worry, little friend.

01:09:17.116 --> 01:09:19.607
I can't believe
you just did that.

01:09:19.685 --> 01:09:23.019
Don't worry. I got it all covered.
The 24 hours is almost up.

01:09:23.089 --> 01:09:26.024
Then we'll get Gustav's money,
then we'll pick him up like that.

01:09:26.091 --> 01:09:29.788
- I'm not talking about that!
- What are you talking about?

01:09:29.862 --> 01:09:34.424
You said he was your best friend.
I thought I was your best friend.

01:09:35.902 --> 01:09:38.700
Chubby-woomsy.

01:09:38.770 --> 01:09:42.502
You are my best friend.
That's why I picked Ninja.

01:09:50.716 --> 01:09:52.149
Hello.

01:09:52.218 --> 01:09:55.085
- Hello, Pest.
- The one and only.

01:09:55.154 --> 01:09:58.920
And you are? Wait, don't tell me.
You'll spoil the moment.

01:09:58.992 --> 01:10:00.425
Gustav.

01:10:00.493 --> 01:10:03.462
Pest, you have
a marvelous family.

01:10:03.529 --> 01:10:07.260
My family was never part
of the contract.

01:10:07.333 --> 01:10:10.894
Neither was your girlfriend's family
or her best friend.

01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:14.701
But I don't care.
I'm gonna kill 'em all!

01:10:14.774 --> 01:10:19.143
He's gonna kill my family. You do that
and you're gonna be in big trouble.

01:10:19.212 --> 01:10:22.375
Jail even.
Can you say "prison bitch"?

01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:26.650
Tomorrow I return
to my homeland...

01:10:26.719 --> 01:10:29.483
where I regain my status
as a Citizen of Germany.

01:10:29.555 --> 01:10:32.149
But first I have
to settle up with you.

01:10:32.225 --> 01:10:37.128
No, Gustav. You're always thinking of
others. We're even. Go back to Germany.

01:10:37.196 --> 01:10:40.324
Don't even worry about saying good-bye.
Send me a postcard. Fax if you can.

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:44.894
You better get to the freighter
at pier 16 in 20 minutes...

01:10:44.971 --> 01:10:48.771
or you're gonna be
one lonely little Latino.

01:10:48.841 --> 01:10:53.437
I'll be there. But for any reason
I'm late, could you start with Malaria?

01:10:56.215 --> 01:11:01.118
Head to Liberty Ship on pier 16.
Step on it, double it, man!

01:11:05.958 --> 01:11:09.018
Don't be so jumpy.

01:11:09.095 --> 01:11:12.292
- He's got a gun!
- Leave me alone!

01:11:12.365 --> 01:11:17.496
Why are you doing this?
Why are you hunting my Pest?

01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:23.372
The man you know as Pest is actually
an operative in your secret service.

01:11:23.443 --> 01:11:27.607
The underworld has placed a high price
on his head. I intend to collect.

01:11:29.248 --> 01:11:32.445
See, Felix? I told you
that my Pest wasn't just a bum!

01:11:32.518 --> 01:11:34.748
Actually, I lied.
I'm just hunting him...

01:11:34.821 --> 01:11:40.157
because no one will miss
an inconsequential flotsam like him.

01:11:40.226 --> 01:11:43.593
- That makes more sense.
- How could you agree with this monster?

01:11:43.663 --> 01:11:46.791
- Be quiet.
- Sit down. He gets angry.

01:11:57.076 --> 01:12:00.307
You stay here and guard them.

01:12:00.379 --> 01:12:02.677
I'm going to go look around.

01:12:10.223 --> 01:12:15.661
Oh, Jack! Oh, SlapJones, we finally
got the good stuff, kid.

01:12:16.896 --> 01:12:19.922
- Be all you can be!
- Don't ask, don't tell, right?

01:12:19.999 --> 01:12:21.933
What's that mean?

01:12:22.001 --> 01:12:24.333
- Nothing.
- Just checking.

01:12:28.774 --> 01:12:30.935
You have to believe me.

01:12:31.010 --> 01:12:32.944
None of this was my idea.

01:12:36.015 --> 01:12:39.143
I feel you understand.
I get seasick!

01:12:39.218 --> 01:12:41.584
Why would I want to be on a boat?

01:12:41.654 --> 01:12:44.418
Snake boy's got every body
I care about down there.

01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:46.549
We gotta think
of something fast.

01:12:46.626 --> 01:12:51.620
I'm gonna give Gustav a little attitude
adjustment, so you're gonna have...

01:12:51.697 --> 01:12:53.927
I'm not a bad person.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.198
To tell you the truth,
I don't think he's my father.

01:12:59.238 --> 01:13:01.934
Gustav, where are you?

01:13:02.008 --> 01:13:03.999
I have arrived!

01:13:06.345 --> 01:13:09.906
Welcome to the Love Boat.
I'm your waiter Isaac.

01:13:09.982 --> 01:13:14.078
Gustav, where are you?

01:13:14.153 --> 01:13:16.212
Don't be shy.

01:13:16.289 --> 01:13:19.019
Goosey, I can see your bald spot.

01:13:19.091 --> 01:13:21.685
You're getting warmer.
Oh, you're getting hot.

01:13:21.761 --> 01:13:24.696
You're getting really hot.
You're boiling! You're on fire!

01:13:26.032 --> 01:13:28.933
Goosey, look, I'm over here.

01:13:29.001 --> 01:13:30.935
I'm a shadow of my former self.

01:13:35.841 --> 01:13:37.274
SuCker!

01:13:39.645 --> 01:13:45.015
I'm the big Cornholio.
I need T.D. for my bungholio.

01:13:45.084 --> 01:13:48.110
Oh, woeisme. Someone's
turned me in to a walkie-talkie.

01:13:48.187 --> 01:13:51.782
Help me! Help me!

01:13:51.857 --> 01:13:54.382
Why don't you come out, Pest?

01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:59.124
What have you got left after smoking
a huge cigar? A big butt!

01:14:24.657 --> 01:14:26.591
Where are you, Pest?

01:14:28.227 --> 01:14:31.924
You got me, Gustav!
You got me laughin' at you.

01:14:31.998 --> 01:14:34.330
My father is insane.

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.595
Do you know what
he did to me as a child?

01:14:39.972 --> 01:14:42.463
All right, funny boy.

01:14:44.176 --> 01:14:48.112
lf you don't come out,
your girlfriend gets it.

01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:51.741
All right, saggy cheeks.
But if l come out, you gotta let her go.

01:14:51.817 --> 01:14:53.079
Deal!

01:14:59.225 --> 01:15:00.749
Let her go.

01:15:06.866 --> 01:15:09.733
- You're all right!
- Everything's okay.

01:15:09.802 --> 01:15:11.531
Now come closer.

01:15:11.604 --> 01:15:14.505
Any closer and
I'd be intimate with you.

01:15:16.175 --> 01:15:19.144
- Only one pest can't be exterminated.
- But I thought...

01:15:21.681 --> 01:15:24.411
Now drop your weapons.

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:30.382
I don't know how long
I can keep this thing from firing.

01:15:33.626 --> 01:15:35.719
I loved it.

01:15:35.795 --> 01:15:39.094
I guess we just sit here and wait
till I become a rich man.

01:15:41.233 --> 01:15:43.394
I meant to do that.

01:15:47.606 --> 01:15:50.097
Let me ask you a question.

01:15:50.176 --> 01:15:51.973
How do you feel?

01:15:53.346 --> 01:15:57.373
Fine. Why, do I look bloated?
Am I bloated?

01:15:57.450 --> 01:16:00.214
Do you remember our little toast
on the island, Pest?

01:16:00.286 --> 01:16:03.153
How could I forget?
It gave me indigestion.

01:16:04.457 --> 01:16:06.084
I poisoned your drink.

01:16:06.158 --> 01:16:08.092
What?

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:12.597
And the poison kills
in exactly 18 hours.

01:16:12.665 --> 01:16:14.496
You are so diabolical.

01:16:14.567 --> 01:16:17.263
Ja.
You've got 15 seconds.

01:16:17.336 --> 01:16:18.997
Enjoy it.

01:16:23.175 --> 01:16:28.169
And by the way, the safe deposit box
is in the Miami Central Bank.

01:16:28.247 --> 01:16:31.011
Your $50,000 is in there.

01:16:31.083 --> 01:16:33.517
Not that it would do you
any good.

01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:39.981
What are you talking about?
Hold this.

01:16:40.059 --> 01:16:42.459
I never felt better
in my life!

01:16:42.528 --> 01:16:44.519
lf l was poisoned,
could I do this?

01:16:47.032 --> 01:16:50.661
Or this? Or this?

01:17:10.356 --> 01:17:12.085
I got the head bag.

01:17:12.158 --> 01:17:14.285
Forget it.
That face would just annoy me.

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:15.827
You cheated!

01:17:15.895 --> 01:17:20.559
- Not now. We'll discuss this at home.
- You'd have to shoot me first.

01:17:23.035 --> 01:17:26.004
- Can't believe you shot him!
- He's wearing a bullet proofvest.

01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:30.208
It doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.

01:17:30.276 --> 01:17:33.507
All right, fine! Himmel,
you stay here amongst the losers.

01:17:33.579 --> 01:17:35.012
Come on, Leo.

01:17:36.382 --> 01:17:38.316
Where to?

01:17:38.384 --> 01:17:41.751
We have much to do.
We're on our way to the homeland.

01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:51.858
Good morning. I need
to get into my safe deposit box.

01:17:51.931 --> 01:17:54.491
Of course, Mr. Shank.
The guard will let you in.

01:17:54.567 --> 01:17:57.229
Ja. Splendid.

01:18:03.943 --> 01:18:06.411
I'll just be a minute, Andy.

01:18:38.744 --> 01:18:40.371
Hello?

01:18:40.446 --> 01:18:42.243
Surprise!

01:18:42.314 --> 01:18:44.805
- Pest!
- Yup.

01:18:44.884 --> 01:18:47.853
- But, the poison should've...
- Killed me?

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:52.823
Not likely, sinCe I puked up all
the poison on that thrilling boat ride.

01:18:52.892 --> 01:18:58.592
With the help of my friend, the German
Ambassador, I liberated your money.

01:18:58.664 --> 01:19:03.158
- My money?
- Right. And there was more than $50,000.

01:19:03.235 --> 01:19:07.137
And CheCk this. The Ambassador also
spoke withthe authorities about your...

01:19:07.206 --> 01:19:09.299
How should l put itECCentriC hunting aCtivities.

01:19:09.375 --> 01:19:12.902
Hello, fellas. Good-bye.
Don't forget to write.

01:19:12.978 --> 01:19:14.570
I'll get you!

01:19:16.916 --> 01:19:19.942
No! No!
I do not recognize your authority.

01:19:20.019 --> 01:19:22.715
Go, Pest
Freak to the east

01:19:24.557 --> 01:19:25.990
Yes!

01:19:27.059 --> 01:19:29.527
There he is!
I'm gonna kill you!

01:19:29.595 --> 01:19:32.155
- How dare you!
- I'm sorry, Mr. Ambassador.

01:19:32.231 --> 01:19:34.165
He's not the Ambassador.
He's an impostor!

01:19:34.233 --> 01:19:39.170
How dare you question my authority!

01:19:39.238 --> 01:19:43.004
lf l wasn't the Ambassador...

01:19:43.075 --> 01:19:46.340
would I have the confidence
to do this?

01:19:47.546 --> 01:19:49.309
and this?

01:19:53.886 --> 01:19:56.878
Would I have the down right
perverse impudence...

01:19:56.956 --> 01:19:58.856
and lack of love for my fellow man
to do this?

01:19:58.924 --> 01:20:01.154
- Wedgie!
- God!

01:20:01.226 --> 01:20:03.717
There fore I must be
the Ambassador.

01:20:03.796 --> 01:20:05.855
He is not even German.

01:20:05.931 --> 01:20:07.626
Our feet are the same.

01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:10.965
Good-bye to you and you and you!

01:20:11.036 --> 01:20:12.970
Let's take him away!

01:20:22.214 --> 01:20:25.115

What's up, man?

01:20:28.821 --> 01:20:31.756
I knew you were
my best friend, right?

01:20:31.824 --> 01:20:33.849
- I know.
- He stole my clothes.

01:20:33.926 --> 01:20:35.894
Get your white behind

01:20:35.961 --> 01:20:39.556
How many times do I have to tell you?
I'm half black.

01:20:39.632 --> 01:20:41.497
