00:07.450 --> 00:09.205
Elisha? The doctor will see you now.

00:11.295 --> 00:13.313
Mom, I'm 14.

00:13.721 --> 00:15.627
Well, I mean, I always go in with you.

00:15.688 --> 00:18.023
Mom, I'll be fine. It's just my knee.

00:19.948 --> 00:20.592
Fine...

00:21.406 --> 00:22.082
I guess.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:34.361 --> 00:35.058
Can I help you?

00:35.153 --> 00:38.605
I don't know. It just seems like my daughter's been in there an awfully long time.

00:39.968 --> 00:40.719
Doctor?

00:41.518 --> 00:44.067
Mrs. Walters was just wondering about an ETA on Elisha.

00:50.912 --> 00:51.601
Doctor?

00:57.000 --> 00:58.484
Doctor, please open this door.

00:58.603 --> 01:00.169
Oh, my God. Something's wrong. I can feel it.

01:02.290 --> 01:03.862
- Doctor?!
- What's going on?

01:04.052 --> 01:05.417
I don't know. The door's locked.

01:05.966 --> 01:08.102
What do you mean, locked? I need to see my daughter.

01:08.588 --> 01:11.399
- Mrs. Walters, you should really wait...
- Open that door! Open it right now!

01:11.419 --> 01:12.494
I need to see my daughter!

01:14.462 --> 01:15.352
Elisha!

01:15.854 --> 01:16.606
Elisha?!

01:17.256 --> 01:17.983
Elisha?!

01:30.014 --> 01:31.791
First, do no harm.

01:32.493 --> 01:37.362
I swear in the presence of the Almighty and before my family, my teachers and my peers

01:37.455 --> 01:41.913
that according to my ability and judgment, I will keep this Oath and Stipulation.

01:43.727 --> 01:44.444
Ladies...

01:45.913 --> 01:47.981
if you'll kindly take a seat in the waiting room,

01:48.270 --> 01:50.884
the Doctor and I will finish up and be with you shortly.

02:41.814 --> 02:43.713
Daddy, this is completely unfair.

02:43.828 --> 02:47.017
Nighttime is for homework. Mornings are for breakfast and getting dressed and...

02:47.048 --> 02:48.485
Not if you don't do your homework at night.

02:48.593 --> 02:51.384
And not if you don't tell anybody about it until ten minutes from walking out the door.

02:51.475 --> 02:53.687
This isn't really homework. We're just supposed to guess!

02:53.770 --> 02:55.219
Ariel, it's really homework.

02:55.356 --> 02:57.035
Look, if you don't want my help, just say "Daddy..."

02:57.109 --> 02:59.417
Daddy, I don't want your help.

02:59.534 --> 03:00.201
Hey.

03:02.675 --> 03:05.894
All right. Never mind. Help.

03:06.011 --> 03:08.024
- Come on. This is easy.
- Here. This is easy.

03:08.526 --> 03:12.200
We stack the pennies ten pennies high, we measure that, okay?

03:15.009 --> 03:16.947
- One-half inch.
- One-half inch.

03:17.026 --> 03:18.940
One-half inch. And then move the stacks into a cube,

03:18.996 --> 03:21.760
which is four stacks wide, four stacks deep, okay?

03:22.080 --> 03:26.528
Then you measure the width and the depth of that square and multiply that by the height.

03:26.632 --> 03:29.524
We can calculate the volume of 160 pennies.

03:29.877 --> 03:30.855
- Cool.
- Okay?

03:30.941 --> 03:33.481
And once you know that, you can divide the volume of this container

03:33.542 --> 03:36.036
by that number and calculate how many pennies are in there.

03:36.213 --> 03:39.348
The assignment is to guess how many pennies are in the jar.

03:39.508 --> 03:42.025
So why can't we just, you know, guess?

03:42.104 --> 03:45.328
Because math isn't about guessing. Math is about calculation. So let's calculate.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.449
Math is about stupid.

03:47.745 --> 03:49.558
Well, I like math.

03:49.854 --> 03:51.288
What a surprise.

03:51.386 --> 03:53.101
Sweetie, don't get upset. Just do it.

03:56.937 --> 03:57.675
Anything?

03:57.879 --> 03:59.804
A lot of horror stories about medicine,

03:59.870 --> 04:02.840
but most of them are about people losing their health insurance.

04:03.136 --> 04:05.906
Nothing about a 14-year-old girl in a soccer uniform.

04:05.993 --> 04:06.746
Excellent.

04:07.115 --> 04:07.981
Why aren't you smiling?

04:09.668 --> 04:10.981
Do they all have to come true?

04:11.216 --> 04:12.379
Do they all have to mean something?

04:12.541 --> 04:14.959
Well, I'm not rooting for a teenage girl to get hacked to death

04:14.989 --> 04:16.740
by her doctor if that's what you mean.

04:17.274 --> 04:19.593
You're right. It's like checking the answering machine.

04:19.680 --> 04:22.394
Not everybody who leaves a message is important, but

04:22.782 --> 04:25.322
you'd sure hate to miss the message that is.

04:26.510 --> 04:29.530
On March third, 1991, a Dr. Kenneth Holloway was treating

04:29.571 --> 04:32.485
a 14-year-old girl for some kind of sports injury.

04:32.797 --> 04:35.452
After he and the girl had been in the exam room for over an hour,

04:35.508 --> 04:37.323
the mother asked the nurse to check on them.

04:38.034 --> 04:39.217
Just like in your dream.

04:39.679 --> 04:43.484
Holloway had molested the girl and then he began savagely dissecting her.

04:43.856 --> 04:46.310
He had already removed her small and large intestine

04:46.356 --> 04:49.114
when the nurse and the victim's mother finally broke in on him.

04:51.664 --> 04:52.422
That's him.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.096
That's the guy I dreamt about.

04:55.090 --> 04:56.759
1991? Are you sure?

04:56.887 --> 04:57.594
Check the file.

04:58.685 --> 05:00.947
I remember they stuck him in the Halcott Institute.

05:02.318 --> 05:04.470
State-run mental facility outside Yuma.

05:04.588 --> 05:07.076
I don't understand. They found him with the body.

05:07.169 --> 05:09.057
He admitted he killed her. Why isn't he in prison?

05:09.877 --> 05:11.398
I was Assistant D.A. at the time.

05:11.459 --> 05:15.314
I didn't handle the case, but I remember that Holloway claimed

05:15.364 --> 05:20.158
that he had been hearing voices urging him to butcher young girls for almost two years.

05:20.731 --> 05:24.985
His lawyer argued that since this was the first and only child his client had hurt

05:25.047 --> 05:29.275
that he shouldn't be punished for his crime, but instead be treated for his illness.

05:29.358 --> 05:31.278
And  the jury agreed.

05:32.856 --> 05:33.649
Who's this?

05:34.478 --> 05:35.497
That's Brittany Walters.

05:37.256 --> 05:38.723
The girl Dr. Holloway murdered?

05:39.926 --> 05:41.344
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

05:42.026 --> 05:42.839
It says right here.

05:44.114 --> 05:46.019
This isn't the same girl from my dream.

05:46.925 --> 05:48.078
She looked different and

05:49.074 --> 05:50.637
I don't think her name was Brittany.

05:52.695 --> 05:55.362
They called her "Elisha." Everyone called her Elisha.

05:55.605 --> 05:56.577
I don't know what to tell you.

05:58.039 --> 05:59.767
- What about the other guy?
- What "other guy"?

06:00.975 --> 06:02.188
There was another man in the room.

06:02.271 --> 06:05.694
He wore a dark suit. He had these piercing eyes.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.065
I don't recall ever hearing about someone else being involved.

06:10.083 --> 06:12.823
Allison, this crime was solved over 14 years ago.

06:17.117 --> 06:17.947
What do we think?

06:18.378 --> 06:19.176
You're amazing.

06:21.256 --> 06:24.231
You think I could get maybe a hundred copies for the District Attorney?

06:25.761 --> 06:28.265
What are the chances of my, uh...?

06:30.886 --> 06:32.188
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something?

06:32.509 --> 06:35.196
No, no, no. We're just making copies. Could you come back in ten minutes?

06:38.828 --> 06:39.673
Who might this be?

06:40.286 --> 06:40.952
Looks familiar.

06:43.015 --> 06:44.387
Someone's accomplice, I think.

06:44.833 --> 06:45.581
What'd he do?

06:45.939 --> 06:47.552
He and his friend raped a young girl,

06:47.737 --> 06:49.626
sliced her open, took her apart.

06:49.996 --> 06:52.190
Wow. How come I didn't hear about this?

06:52.385 --> 06:53.717
It happened a while ago.

06:53.887 --> 06:54.991
'91, I think.

06:55.837 --> 06:56.627
Excuse me?

06:58.411 --> 06:59.809
I  had one of my things.

07:00.168 --> 07:01.273
They never caught the guy?

07:01.575 --> 07:02.513
They caught one of them.

07:03.529 --> 07:04.767
But this guy got away?

07:05.036 --> 07:07.371
Kinda. Sorta. I don't think they knew he was there.

07:08.656 --> 07:09.722
I see.

07:10.117 --> 07:12.655
Cold case with a suspect that no one's even looking for.

07:12.901 --> 07:15.374
I don't pick 'em, Detective Scanlon. They pick me.

07:18.888 --> 07:21.621
So then Mr. Beauchamp starts passing out the pennies,

07:21.688 --> 07:24.058
60 or 70 on each person's desk.

07:24.199 --> 07:26.444
And then we start counting them up,

07:26.511 --> 07:29.132
and we write down the totals on the board and add them up:

07:29.230 --> 07:32.286
1,823 pennies exactly.

07:32.553 --> 07:33.428
Exactly.

07:33.838 --> 07:34.794
Exactly.

07:35.891 --> 07:37.994
Is that even close to a katrillion?

07:38.444 --> 07:39.274
It's close.

07:39.541 --> 07:42.490
Oh, also, Miss Bishop sent home a note about something.

07:42.525 --> 07:43.487
It's in my book bag.

07:45.328 --> 07:46.882
It think it might be about math camp.

07:46.965 --> 07:49.439
If it is, I don't want to go.

07:51.158 --> 07:52.494
You get that, I'll get the phone.

07:58.429 --> 07:59.028
Hello.

07:59.422 --> 08:01.961
Allison? It's Lee Scanlon. Am I catching you at a bad time?

08:02.060 --> 08:04.064
No. I'm just putting the kids to bed. What's going on?

08:04.303 --> 08:06.839
I know how weird this sounds, but I think I found your guy.

08:06.958 --> 08:07.947
The one with the beard.

08:08.269 --> 08:09.774
The one who likes to hack up girls?

08:09.909 --> 08:10.705
You're kidding.

08:11.167 --> 08:13.010
No. Remember I said he looked familiar?

08:13.220 --> 08:14.295
Now I know why.

08:15.012 --> 08:18.524
I'm at this place I come to three or four times a week to have dinner, and there he is.

08:19.098 --> 08:21.778
Is there any way I could get you to come down here and I.D. him?

08:22.607 --> 08:24.771
Her math teacher wants to meet with one of us.

08:25.697 --> 08:28.478
I don't think he meant right now.

08:30.267 --> 08:32.446
So he's got a bunch of times down here for tomorrow.

08:32.501 --> 08:33.604
Are you all right with 2:00?

08:33.711 --> 08:36.106
'Cause if you are, I'll just sign this thing and put it back in Ariel's book bag

08:36.179 --> 08:37.756
and then he'll know to expect you.

08:37.847 --> 08:38.472
Sure.

08:39.327 --> 08:41.094
Detective Scanlon called.

08:41.186 --> 08:43.986
Seems he spotted my bearded accomplice.

08:44.196 --> 08:45.764
The one from 1991?

08:47.589 --> 08:49.702
And you're getting dressed because...

08:50.325 --> 08:52.892
you're afraid to meet him in your dreams and be naked?

08:54.351 --> 08:56.265
He's at a restaurant downtown.

08:56.494 --> 08:57.375
I see.

08:58.422 --> 08:59.705
I'll only be an hour.

09:01.830 --> 09:03.556
Hmm. I'll be here.

09:03.747 --> 09:05.005
You'd better be.

09:22.680 --> 09:23.447
Did you see him?

09:24.231 --> 09:25.050
Don't look around.

09:25.486 --> 09:26.867
Don't call attention to yourself.

09:28.771 --> 09:29.545
Follow me.

09:30.856 --> 09:33.519
Act like we're together. I'm gonna casually walk by him.

09:58.704 --> 09:59.636
So, did you see him?

10:00.157 --> 10:02.052
- No, I was waiting for you...
- You're kidding!

10:03.173 --> 10:04.582
How about right now? Do you see him?

10:07.786 --> 10:08.928
He's right behind me.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.985
Dr. Charles "The Butcher" Walker of Wichita.

10:15.917 --> 10:18.380
Wanted dead or alive for the maniacal evisceration

10:18.441 --> 10:20.525
of three unmarried daughters from the Great Plains.

10:23.421 --> 10:24.519
Pretty good match, right?

10:25.287 --> 10:26.864
Knew I'd seen him before. Who knew?

10:27.013 --> 10:28.154
Turns out he's a regular.

10:29.110 --> 10:33.674
The thing is, since he was captured and lynched by an angry mob in 1902,

10:33.863 --> 10:37.011
I'm not completely certain I can put him at the scene of the Brittany Walters murder.

10:39.844 --> 10:41.179
Oh, come on. It's funny.

10:42.239 --> 10:44.030
You have to admit it's funny, right?

10:46.868 --> 10:48.286
All right. Maybe you don't.

10:50.805 --> 10:51.542
Hi.

10:52.750 --> 10:54.634
You know it's 2:45 in the morning?

10:55.590 --> 10:58.792
I had so much room to move around in bed, I woke myself up.

11:01.097 --> 11:03.601
So what's it like supping with a serial killer? I mean...

11:04.885 --> 11:05.986
who paid the check?

11:06.861 --> 11:09.836
There  was no supping. There was no check.

11:10.036 --> 11:13.329
Turns out my serial killer was dead.

11:13.513 --> 11:15.826
Mm, honey. That bastard.

11:16.201 --> 11:17.645
Standing up my wife.

11:17.952 --> 11:20.292
If he wasn't already dead, I'd kill him.

11:21.885 --> 11:24.356
Uh, hey, here's a crazy thought.

11:24.465 --> 11:27.547
How 'bout you shut down that computer and come to bed with your husband?

11:27.808 --> 11:30.480
Turns out he's been dead for over a century.

11:30.772 --> 11:32.400
Clearly  he's a man of conviction.

11:33.122 --> 11:34.659
So what about this sleeping thing?

11:34.770 --> 11:35.452
You game?

11:35.738 --> 11:36.722
You wanna give it a shot?

11:41.867 --> 11:45.253
"Dr. Charles Walker, born 1870 in Wichita, Kansas,

11:45.650 --> 11:48.094
died in 1902 in Phoenix, Arizona..."

11:48.401 --> 11:49.358
And in between?

11:49.425 --> 11:53.326
And in between, he raped and murdered 14 young women in cold blood.

11:54.027 --> 11:56.726
He'd go from town to town, he'd set up his shingle,

11:56.782 --> 11:58.799
pick out a victim and bide his time.

11:59.199 --> 12:02.117
Wait for her to seek him out for some kind of medical problem.

12:02.829 --> 12:05.538
Then he'd send his nurse home, spend a few hours

12:05.729 --> 12:08.631
torturing the girl with various medical devices.

12:09.741 --> 12:13.110
Finally, he'd cut her open and leave her for her family to find.

12:14.596 --> 12:16.003
Who does that sound like?

12:18.999 --> 12:20.801
I just, I don't understand.

12:20.965 --> 12:23.110
Why am I dreaming about Holloway now?

12:23.187 --> 12:24.948
That was almost 15 years ago.

12:26.038 --> 12:28.808
And why am I dreaming about Walker at all? He's...

12:29.060 --> 12:31.287
Sleeping soundly.

12:32.274 --> 12:33.693
...Bush in Washington.

12:34.016 --> 12:34.731
Hello?

12:35.015 --> 12:36.938
May 23, 2005...

12:37.006 --> 12:38.558
Yes, I'm holding for the doctor.

12:40.052 --> 12:43.958
I understand, but I really need to bring my daughter in there today.

12:45.198 --> 12:48.035
She's been on the medication for a week now,

12:48.121 --> 12:49.777
but she's not getting any better.

12:49.939 --> 12:52.756
In fact, I think she might actually be getting worse.

12:54.097 --> 12:55.746
No, I'm totally flexible.

12:56.007 --> 12:57.757
I just want to get her in there.

12:59.631 --> 13:00.371
Thank you.

13:01.569 --> 13:02.724
Thank you so much.

13:03.947 --> 13:04.931
We'll see you then.

13:08.259 --> 13:09.031
Mom?

13:11.437 --> 13:12.892
What's wrong with me?

13:13.128 --> 13:15.621
Elisha baby, don't worry.

13:16.083 --> 13:18.115
The doctor will fix everything.

13:33.073 --> 13:34.157
I need a favor.

13:41.335 --> 13:44.949
You know, I've imagined waking up like this a bunch of times,

13:45.277 --> 13:47.238
but in my version you weren't dressed.

13:48.861 --> 13:50.786
Can you take the girls to school this morning?

13:51.860 --> 13:55.200
Hmm, wait, this is completely different from anything I imagined.

13:55.691 --> 13:57.673
And can you pick them up this afternoon?

13:58.845 --> 14:00.135
I see. My mistake.

14:00.400 --> 14:01.677
What this is is a nightmare.

14:01.784 --> 14:03.720
It just took me a second to pick up on it.

14:03.887 --> 14:05.788
Wonderful-- I tell you I need a favor

14:05.865 --> 14:08.450
and instead I get a front row table at The Belly Room.

14:08.799 --> 14:10.314
And just why do you need this favor?

14:10.391 --> 14:11.332
Where are you going to be exactly?

14:11.451 --> 14:12.910
Yuma. Exactly.

14:13.749 --> 14:16.121
Why, pray tell, are you gonna be in Yuma?

14:16.494 --> 14:18.808
I need to talk to Dr. Kenneth Holloway.

14:19.833 --> 14:22.827
Who's' that, the psycho doctor from 1991?

14:23.044 --> 14:23.903
About what?

14:24.007 --> 14:26.631
About a girl named Elisha. I had another dream about her last night,

14:26.733 --> 14:29.330
and now I know she's not from 1991.

14:29.407 --> 14:32.745
She's  actually from right now, and I think she's in danger.

14:33.299 --> 14:36.013
But he's been behind bars for 14 years. What's he going to tell you?

14:36.079 --> 14:40.585
I don't know. But he's the only person in any of my dreams that's actually alive.

14:40.666 --> 14:41.639
I have to do something.

14:41.885 --> 14:44.490
- I have to talk to someone.
- But he's four hours away.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.665
Please.

14:52.499 --> 14:53.169
All right.

14:55.827 --> 14:56.599
Thank you.

14:58.899 --> 14:59.825
Wait. No.

15:01.474 --> 15:03.292
Ariel's math teacher. 2:00.

15:03.559 --> 15:04.840
Oh, damn.

15:08.265 --> 15:09.115
All right, fine.

15:09.196 --> 15:10.445
I'll take care of it. I'll handle it.

15:10.751 --> 15:12.386
I'll change something around. I'll figure something out.

15:12.469 --> 15:13.240
Are you mad?

15:13.795 --> 15:15.335
Very good, mind reader.

15:17.460 --> 15:19.430
You know what, we'll have this fight when you get back tonight.

15:19.718 --> 15:20.434
Deal.

15:22.144 --> 15:23.507
You see my problem, don't you?

15:23.676 --> 15:25.441
1,788.

15:25.528 --> 15:26.507
That was her estimate.

15:26.795 --> 15:31.637
Her computations, her worksheet, they all led her to 1,788.

15:32.123 --> 15:34.464
Which, by the way, would have been a wonderful answer.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.971
The whole point of this exercise was to teach her how to estimate,

15:38.027 --> 15:39.901
and she clearly understands how to estimate.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.104
Okay, so...?

15:41.527 --> 15:44.740
So the answer she ultimately submitted,

15:44.825 --> 15:51.257
the perfect answer by the way, the exact answer, was 1,823.

15:54.213 --> 15:56.080
1,823.

15:56.679 --> 15:59.424
You can plainly see that her work doesn't match her result.

15:59.515 --> 16:03.377
She clearly didn't arrive at that number based on any sort of arithmetic process.

16:06.606 --> 16:08.388
How do you suppose she came up with it?

16:09.873 --> 16:16.268
Well, I have the number written down here, in my lesson plan.

16:16.673 --> 16:17.825
I keep it on my desk--

16:18.643 --> 16:20.861
cover closed, but on my desk.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.976
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Are you suggesting she cheated?

16:23.528 --> 16:27.005
My daughter somehow snuck up to your desk and looked in your book?

16:27.523 --> 16:29.518
What other logical explanation could there be?

16:32.034 --> 16:33.965
How well do you know my daughter, Mr. Beauchamp?

16:34.024 --> 16:35.761
My daughter's not capable of cheating.

16:35.856 --> 16:38.081
Look, I understand this isn't something a parent wants to hear.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.625
She guessed, that's all. She made an educated guess.

16:40.691 --> 16:42.596
She has very strong instincts about things,

16:42.662 --> 16:45.770
and I'm sure notwithstanding what it says on her worksheet,

16:45.817 --> 16:47.726
she just looked at that jar, it just didn't feel like 1,700...

16:47.777 --> 16:49.931
Mr. Dubois, do you know what the odds are that someone would guess

16:50.008 --> 16:51.812
the exact number of pennies in that jar?

16:51.950 --> 16:54.178
1,823 to one.

16:54.256 --> 16:55.749
Mm, well, see that? You're wrong.

16:56.184 --> 16:57.198
- Excuse me?
- Well, you're wrong.

16:57.260 --> 16:59.415
- Out of what, 25 kids?
- Yeah.

16:59.549 --> 17:03.087
So assuming that no one guessed under 1,000, the chance that any one of them

17:03.150 --> 17:06.527
would have guessed the exact number is actually 25 out of 1,800 and whatever.

17:06.834 --> 17:08.463
That's about one in 40.

17:09.594 --> 17:10.458
What are you, a...?

17:10.643 --> 17:11.599
A mathematician, actually.

17:11.827 --> 17:14.979
The point is is that one in 40 is not entirely out of the realm of possibility.

17:15.060 --> 17:16.607
Mr. Dubois, she changed her answer.

17:16.701 --> 17:18.453
Impulsively. Who knows why? She's a kid.

17:18.815 --> 17:20.674
She didn't look in your book. She didn't cheat.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.859
- You don't know that.
- You don't know that she did.

17:24.012 --> 17:27.376
Okay, wait a second. You're a mathematician. Let's talk probabilities, huh?

17:27.489 --> 17:30.790
Are you suggesting there's a greater probability that she just happened to guess

17:30.862 --> 17:32.894
the right answer than that she looked in my book?

17:32.998 --> 17:35.567
I'm saying I know my daughter better than you do. I'm saying I know she didn't cheat.

17:35.618 --> 17:38.980
And I'm saying if you penalize her based on your completely unfounded suspicion,

17:39.050 --> 17:40.877
then I am going over your head.

17:41.071 --> 17:43.048
Are you threatening me, Mr. Dubois?

17:51.379 --> 17:52.505
Do you think he's dangerous?

17:53.028 --> 17:55.838
Well, he hasn't attacked anyone in the last 12 years, if that's what you mean.

17:57.191 --> 18:02.571
Listen, all we know is that for as long as people have been writing about human behavior,

18:02.638 --> 18:04.629
there have been guys like Dr. Holloway.

18:04.941 --> 18:08.464
They used to call them possessed, or, uh, split personalities.

18:09.340 --> 18:13.185
Kenneth Holloway uffers from a dissociative identity disorder.

18:13.487 --> 18:15.704
He won't get better.

18:16.565 --> 18:17.229
Ever.

18:19.738 --> 18:20.343
All right.

18:29.595 --> 18:30.599
Dr. Holloway.

18:32.102 --> 18:35.641
My  name's Allison Dubois. I'm with the Phoenix District Attorney's office.

18:37.234 --> 18:38.294
Please call me Ken.

18:38.938 --> 18:40.326
I'd shake your hand, but...

18:42.549 --> 18:44.679
Thank you for meeting me on such short notice.

18:44.755 --> 18:45.425
Thank you.

18:46.210 --> 18:47.981
I don't have many visitors.

18:48.073 --> 18:50.925
Thanks for breaking up the monotony of my day.

18:52.000 --> 18:52.967
Do you know this man?

19:03.275 --> 19:05.142
No. I'm sorry.

19:06.074 --> 19:08.271
I don't believe I've ever seen that man before.

19:08.626 --> 19:09.464
He's a doctor.

19:10.693 --> 19:12.706
Likes to rape and cut up young girls.

19:15.678 --> 19:18.158
We don't have a union, Miss Dubois.

19:18.235 --> 19:19.823
It's not like I've seen him at the meetings.

19:22.967 --> 19:24.410
What about the name Elisha?

19:25.434 --> 19:28.019
A young girl around 14 or 15.

19:28.367 --> 19:29.812
Do you know anyone by that name?

19:38.393 --> 19:39.504
How many girls?

19:43.559 --> 19:44.389
Fourteen.

19:48.321 --> 19:49.600
Does he hear the voice?

19:50.717 --> 19:51.479
I don't know.

19:52.155 --> 19:53.446
When you find him, ask him.

19:54.367 --> 19:55.919
He'll know what I'm talking about.

19:56.184 --> 19:57.823
And if he's honest, he'll tell you.

19:58.479 --> 19:59.365
You tell me.

20:02.705 --> 20:03.491
I don't know.

20:04.346 --> 20:06.040
It starts off very quietly.

20:07.659 --> 20:08.961
Mostly when you're alone.

20:09.220 --> 20:11.243
In the shower. In the car.

20:12.768 --> 20:15.810
At night in bed, when my wife was sleeping.

20:15.913 --> 20:18.973
But then you start to hear it everywhere.

20:19.072 --> 20:19.886
In crowds.

20:20.285 --> 20:21.719
In church. On the street.

20:21.903 --> 20:22.907
At a baseball game.

20:23.665 --> 20:24.974
"Look at her. Look at that."

20:25.717 --> 20:28.226
"Don't you want to see it? Don't you want to touch it?"

20:28.293 --> 20:31.821
"Don't you want to cut it open and stick your hands in it?"

20:35.170 --> 20:35.969
And then...

20:38.124 --> 20:39.546
it's all on you here.

20:41.375 --> 20:44.421
He lives inside you...

20:45.951 --> 20:48.988
and you can't find yourself anymore.

21:04.507 --> 21:05.310
Whatcha doing?

21:06.933 --> 21:07.609
Nothing.

21:08.198 --> 21:09.238
Counting the stars?

21:10.483 --> 21:11.624
Estimating, darling.

21:12.240 --> 21:14.122
All you can do is estimate.

21:15.054 --> 21:16.918
Sorry I missed dinner and everything.

21:17.015 --> 21:18.674
I ran into traffic on the way back.

21:18.833 --> 21:20.066
That's all right, we're fine.

21:20.532 --> 21:22.202
That's why God created drive-thru.

21:22.611 --> 21:23.810
Dinner of champions.

21:24.844 --> 21:25.862
So, is everyone sleeping?

21:29.329 --> 21:31.341
Ariel's math teacher, Mr. Beauchamp,

21:31.433 --> 21:32.711
he thinks our daughter's a cheater.

21:33.709 --> 21:34.310
What?

21:34.449 --> 21:38.074
Turns out he kept the exact number of pennies in a lesson plan on his desk,

21:38.140 --> 21:39.661
and he somehow got the idea that Ariel...

21:40.322 --> 21:41.320
She wouldn't do that.

21:43.665 --> 21:45.713
Okay, so what did you tell him?

21:46.025 --> 21:47.716
Well, I told him she made a lucky guess.

21:48.826 --> 21:52.512
He told me that made no sense, and even though I knew he was right, I also knew that I was right.

21:52.850 --> 21:56.169
And I told him if he penalized my daughter for being a cheater, I was gonna go the principal.

21:56.256 --> 21:57.366
No, you didn't.

21:57.534 --> 21:59.650
Well... she's not a cheater.

22:05.931 --> 22:06.526
Hello?

22:08.201 --> 22:09.378
Yes, Dr. McGrath.

22:10.970 --> 22:11.937
No, of course I can.

22:12.430 --> 22:13.356
All right, tomorrow, then.

22:14.749 --> 22:16.675
So, how did you leave it with the principal?

22:16.787 --> 22:17.647
Who was on the phone?

22:17.974 --> 22:18.615
Joe...

22:19.296 --> 22:21.322
He gave me a choice. It's up to me.

22:21.394 --> 22:24.318
Either I can file a formal complaint against Mr. Beauchamp

22:24.394 --> 22:26.331
or Ariel can change math teachers.

22:26.524 --> 22:27.937
I got to let him know tomorrow.

22:28.081 --> 22:29.161
Those are the choices?

22:29.238 --> 22:30.565
I did the best I could do.

22:30.897 --> 22:33.790
That's sort of like shooting a cannon to kill a flea.

22:33.898 --> 22:37.369
Well, hey, you know, I'm not the one who ran off all day talking to some guy

22:37.410 --> 22:39.908
who's been behind bars for 15 years, who couldn't possibly know

22:39.954 --> 22:42.679
anything about anything concerning the here and now.

22:42.790 --> 22:44.014
Excuse me, it's my job.

22:44.087 --> 22:47.548
You know, I been thinking about that, too, and as a matter of fact, it's not your job.

22:48.101 --> 22:51.055
You're starting to think that every time you dream a dream, you're somehow on the clock.

22:52.049 --> 22:55.315
This wasn't a case that was assigned to you, this is something you chose to do.

22:55.413 --> 22:56.094
Fine.

22:56.201 --> 22:59.790
I will go to school tomorrow and see if I can speak with Mr. Beauchamp.

23:00.348 --> 23:02.222
Good. Let's see how you make out.

23:02.350 --> 23:03.806
- Okay. Let's.
- Good.

23:04.731 --> 23:05.494
Damn it!

23:06.067 --> 23:07.956
Oh, my. A hink in the plan already.

23:08.423 --> 23:10.814
On the phone just now-- Kenneth Holloway.

23:10.977 --> 23:15.728
Apparently, shortly after I left, he became extremely agitated, demanded to talk to me.

23:15.953 --> 23:19.708
He told his doctor that there was something he hadn't told me before, something about Elisha.

23:20.249 --> 23:21.651
Wait, I'm having a déjà vu.

23:22.616 --> 23:26.451
I will call and make an appointment to see him day after tomorrow.

23:26.557 --> 23:29.414
Right. I'm sorry, the... teacher or the murderer?

23:50.125 --> 23:50.796
Sorry.

23:51.928 --> 23:52.593
For what?

23:58.210 --> 23:59.429
Making you come back.

24:01.057 --> 24:01.891
Okay.

24:04.482 --> 24:05.516
Is something wrong?

24:08.067 --> 24:09.006
I don't know.

24:12.142 --> 24:13.248
It's the drugs.

24:13.934 --> 24:16.470
Been raising a bit of a ruckus since you left,

24:17.120 --> 24:19.219
so they started in with the meds again.

24:19.281 --> 24:22.357
I don't care, it's... it's kind of nice, actually.

24:22.803 --> 24:25.306
Smooths out the ride, if you know what I mean.

24:26.090 --> 24:28.055
She's dead, by the way.

24:29.448 --> 24:30.770
I'm sorry, who's dead?

24:31.989 --> 24:33.365
Elisha.

24:35.244 --> 24:36.551
That's not possible.

24:36.693 --> 24:39.130
- How can you say that?
- I just saw her.

24:39.238 --> 24:43.068
I don't think so, young lady. You came here yesterday looking for her.

24:43.990 --> 24:47.958
Unless, by "seeing," you mean with something other than the eyes.

24:48.818 --> 24:50.062
So you killed her.

24:50.523 --> 24:53.097
Hm? Unbeknownst to anybody while you were in here,

24:53.329 --> 24:54.179
you killed her.

24:55.377 --> 24:58.360
I am psychologically impaired, but I'm not an idiot.

24:59.591 --> 25:01.341
It was in 1990.

25:03.286 --> 25:05.524
I'd been hearing the voice for about a year,

25:05.949 --> 25:09.283
but there were always people around, and for a long time, I was able to...

25:09.881 --> 25:10.854
not listen.

25:11.607 --> 25:14.787
But that June, I was driving from Phoenix to Los Angeles

25:14.885 --> 25:18.177
for a medical conference all by myself.

25:19.558 --> 25:24.407
I was on I-10, that long stretch of road where it's just a single lane,

25:24.642 --> 25:26.302
nothing but empty desert.

25:27.232 --> 25:29.352
And, inexplicably,

25:30.003 --> 25:32.400
she was just standing there.

25:34.411 --> 25:36.879
I saw her from miles away.

25:38.303 --> 25:40.838
I thought she was an optical illusion at first,

25:41.119 --> 25:45.435
but I kept getting closer, and she refused to disappear.

25:45.497 --> 25:47.406
It was like she was taunting me.

25:48.555 --> 25:51.447
She was standing on the shoulder with her thumb out.

25:52.531 --> 25:55.045
She was wearing jeans and a T-shirt,

25:56.490 --> 25:59.689
and she had those baby breasts they get at that age.

25:59.776 --> 26:00.723
Dr. Holloway...

26:01.000 --> 26:03.898
She was thirsty. I gave her a soda.

26:05.512 --> 26:08.173
A soda and some sleeping pills.

26:09.803 --> 26:13.534
And by Ely, Nevada, she was out.

26:15.034 --> 26:16.965
I rented a hotel room.

26:19.944 --> 26:21.572
You don't want to hear the rest.

26:36.667 --> 26:38.919
Hm. I remember you.

26:40.312 --> 26:41.191
Sorry.

26:44.654 --> 26:47.884
Hello. Mr. Beauchamp, this is, uh, Allison Dubois.

26:47.971 --> 26:50.638
I am Ariel's mother, and I was hoping to speak with you

26:50.675 --> 26:55.462
at your earliest convenience about the misunderstanding about Ariel and the penny jar.

26:55.518 --> 27:00.844
Uh, if you could give me a call, at 602-555-0147...

27:00.929 --> 27:03.054
Yes. 'Course I mean it.

27:05.123 --> 27:06.214
I got to call you right back.

27:06.594 --> 27:07.418
What's this?

27:07.908 --> 27:10.044
It's nothing-- which is the good news.

27:10.151 --> 27:12.343
There were no Elishas reported missing or dead in the states

27:12.405 --> 27:16.234
of Arizona, California, Texas or Nevada for the whole of 1990.

27:16.659 --> 27:19.362
No Elishas. No Allyces.

27:19.480 --> 27:22.122
One Lisa, but she was in her '60s.

27:22.414 --> 27:24.078
I don't get it. Why would he lie to me?

27:25.475 --> 27:29.309
Allison, the man's a sociopath-- maybe it gave him some pleasure knowing

27:29.331 --> 27:33.027
that you'd be spinning your wheels all day looking for a girl who doesn't even exist.

27:33.545 --> 27:36.166
Maybe he just thinks it's fun.

27:41.988 --> 27:42.770
You lied to me.

27:42.853 --> 27:43.636
You lied to me.

27:43.728 --> 27:44.691
You said you killed her.

27:44.758 --> 27:46.028
You said you saw her.

27:46.401 --> 27:47.551
I guess we're even.

27:49.017 --> 27:50.722
You've got the vision, don't you?

27:51.890 --> 27:53.349
Who am I talking to?

27:53.845 --> 27:56.149
Who do you think you're talking to?

27:58.001 --> 27:59.846
I want to show you something.

28:00.014 --> 28:00.711
By all means.

28:00.778 --> 28:03.861
1934, Dr. Eric Lorenz murdered a 16-year-old patient

28:03.948 --> 28:06.926
who was complaining of swollen tonsils. He said he heard voices.

28:07.409 --> 28:10.942
1950, Dr. Kevin Deibolt raped and murdered a 12-year-old patient

28:10.998 --> 28:14.730
while her mother and two brothers sat in the waiting room-- he said he heard a voice.

28:14.843 --> 28:15.498
Interesting.

28:15.581 --> 28:19.784
In 1960, Dr. Peter Seanery raped and murdered a 13-year-old

28:19.850 --> 28:21.956
at a public health clinic in Detroit.

28:22.117 --> 28:26.040
There's another one in 1977. You killed her in '91.

28:26.676 --> 28:31.309
Seems like every 15 years or so, someone hears a voice and a young girl dies.

28:32.564 --> 28:34.504
Have any hungers, ma'am?

28:36.644 --> 28:38.513
I'll let you in on a secret.

28:39.241 --> 28:42.563
When you die, they don't go away.

28:46.255 --> 28:47.974
You saw us in a dream, right?

28:48.338 --> 28:49.301
Me and the girl?

28:50.997 --> 28:52.947
I've heard about the likes of you.

28:54.073 --> 28:55.926
You see souls, don't you?

28:56.008 --> 28:56.986
You got the vision.

28:58.399 --> 28:59.874
Where is she?

29:01.486 --> 29:05.061
How can you know so much and know so little?

29:07.462 --> 29:09.970
You're obviously extraordinarily sensitive.

29:10.032 --> 29:11.998
Most people aren't sensitive at all.

29:12.546 --> 29:15.924
Then some people are a little sensitive.

29:16.509 --> 29:18.741
They certainly don't see the dead.

29:19.540 --> 29:20.886
Don't even hear 'em.

29:22.085 --> 29:25.509
They just feel something strange once in a while,

29:25.685 --> 29:30.718
hear a really distant voice telling them what to do.

29:31.285 --> 29:34.706
"Don't make that right turn-- that's not the way to Grandma's."

29:35.422 --> 29:38.678
"Don't answer the phone call-- it's bad news."

29:39.636 --> 29:42.012
"Don't marry that man-- he's no good for you."

29:42.652 --> 29:44.454
When I find one like that--

29:45.120 --> 29:46.277
a doctor...

29:47.607 --> 29:49.564
a doctor-to-be...

29:50.491 --> 29:53.634
Yeah. It takes 15 years.

29:54.136 --> 29:57.060
First four or five, you're screaming just to be heard. Then...

29:58.310 --> 30:00.537
they start listening for you.

30:02.421 --> 30:05.142
Then you're all they hear.

30:05.299 --> 30:06.471
Where is she?

30:06.732 --> 30:08.917
It doesn't matter; no one's gonna kill her.

30:09.005 --> 30:10.198
You have my word.

30:10.674 --> 30:12.324
Cross my heart and hope to...

30:13.690 --> 30:14.524
whatever.

30:15.087 --> 30:15.983
Where is she!

30:16.157 --> 30:20.033
I know what you're planning; I know the date you plan on doing it; I will find her!

30:25.307 --> 30:26.239
Mr. Beauchamp.

30:27.706 --> 30:28.947
Allison Dubois.

30:29.490 --> 30:30.892
I'm Ariel's mother.

30:32.229 --> 30:36.131
I know, I'm 35 minutes late and I know you're on your way out the door

30:36.449 --> 30:39.151
and I'm sorry, but I didn't get your message till almost 1:00.

30:39.637 --> 30:42.413
I work for the District Attorney's Office and I was interviewing a prisoner

30:42.501 --> 30:44.609
and they don't let you take your cell phone in with you.

30:45.408 --> 30:49.321
But, actually, and I think this is germane to the conversation,

30:50.072 --> 30:53.252
I kind of guessed that you were going to want to see me this afternoon,

30:53.374 --> 30:56.239
so even though I didn't get your message till I was an hour and a half outside of Yuma,

30:56.324 --> 30:57.718
I've been rushing back the whole time.

30:58.296 --> 31:01.259
So, if you need to reschedule, if you need to leave...

31:02.388 --> 31:04.252
I completely understand.

31:04.941 --> 31:07.716
No, I'm perfectly happy to stay. I just...

31:09.190 --> 31:13.467
I can't imagine what you're going to say that's going to change my point of view about the situation.

31:13.774 --> 31:15.141
My daughter didn't cheat.

31:15.233 --> 31:17.584
And I know you absolutely believe that,

31:17.666 --> 31:19.360
and frankly, I'd like to believe that.

31:19.826 --> 31:22.170
But there's simply no other explanation for what happened.

31:22.283 --> 31:23.200
But there is.

31:25.633 --> 31:26.640
She guessed.

31:29.175 --> 31:30.584
I went through this with your husband, but...

31:30.660 --> 31:32.647
No, I know, and I'm sorry that got so heated.

31:32.722 --> 31:34.361
Nobody's filing any complaints.

31:34.485 --> 31:36.178
Nobody's changing classes.

31:38.063 --> 31:41.857
And I wouldn't even be here wasting your time except the one thing that he didn't tell you,

31:42.031 --> 31:43.358
that he probably should have,

31:44.268 --> 31:45.079
is that...

31:47.485 --> 31:49.096
on my side of the family--

31:50.111 --> 31:54.017
my grandmother, me, Ariel--

31:55.303 --> 31:57.454
we've just, we've always been good at guessing.

31:58.969 --> 31:59.747
I know.

32:00.525 --> 32:03.341
What parents won't do to make sure their kids get good grades.

32:03.407 --> 32:05.639
But in this case, it happens to be true.

32:05.728 --> 32:10.592
I mean, your initials T.O.B., I'm guessing "O" stands for Oliver.

32:11.666 --> 32:12.757
Good guessing, right?

32:12.890 --> 32:14.734
I know, kind of a silly thing, but...

32:16.350 --> 32:19.492
I've just always had it and Ariel has it, too.

32:21.994 --> 32:22.660
Mrs. Dubois...

32:22.756 --> 32:25.050
Dentist, tomorrow afternoon, right?

32:26.105 --> 32:29.167
I didn't look through any of your books, I swear.

32:30.821 --> 32:32.162
The irony is...

32:33.583 --> 32:35.490
it embarrasses her.

32:36.432 --> 32:38.644
I mean, if you mention it to anybody,

32:38.766 --> 32:40.897
she would die of mortification.

32:41.510 --> 32:44.359
And I do need to sit down with her and have a conversation

32:44.435 --> 32:47.224
about the difference between being asked a question in class

32:47.333 --> 32:50.246
and giving a considered, worked out answer and just...

32:51.198 --> 32:54.761
guessing, and for that, I do apologize.

32:56.184 --> 32:58.601
So I just wanted to stop by and tell you that

32:59.497 --> 33:02.252
whatever decision you make, we can live with it,

33:02.815 --> 33:04.976
because I know you'll make the right decision.

33:05.861 --> 33:06.907
I know it.

33:08.023 --> 33:09.733
Well, at least I'm pretty sure.

33:11.925 --> 33:14.765
See? You'll still have time to make it to the car wash.

33:17.929 --> 33:21.780
You can't just do that. You can't just tell me you fixed it and not tell me how.

33:22.032 --> 33:23.510
I didn't fix it. I just...

33:24.422 --> 33:27.981
followed it through. I followed your bad cop with my good cop.

33:28.375 --> 33:29.881
You're patronizing me.

33:31.130 --> 33:35.445
I just shifted the conversation from "probabilities" to "possibilities."

33:35.518 --> 33:39.854
The point is... our eldest daughter's record remains blemish-free.

33:39.992 --> 33:44.046
And there's still a chance that she can learn to smoke pot at the college of her choice.

33:47.206 --> 33:47.967
Come here.

34:00.401 --> 34:01.742
Kiss me, will ya?

34:13.047 --> 34:16.297
You think you could see your way clear to climb over here and hold me...

34:16.980 --> 34:18.228
tell me everything is going to be okay?

34:18.674 --> 34:21.130
Why wouldn't everything be okay, hmm?

34:25.637 --> 34:27.219
Why wouldn't everything be okay?

34:29.366 --> 34:30.592
Day after tomorrow...

34:31.812 --> 34:34.223
a young girl named Elisha is gonna die,

34:35.156 --> 34:37.659
and I don't have a clue how to stop it.

34:38.920 --> 34:40.081
Why don't you call the police?

34:51.043 --> 34:51.918
I'm sorry.

34:53.713 --> 34:54.717
I need your help.

34:55.708 --> 34:57.270
...Bush in Washington.

34:57.786 --> 35:01.723
Whatever it is that's gonna happen I know it's gonna happen tomorrow, the 23rd.

35:01.903 --> 35:03.998
The mother's on the phone with the doctor's office,

35:04.099 --> 35:06.204
her daughter's sick, the medicine isn't working.

35:06.367 --> 35:09.132
When her mother's on the phone, does she mention the doctor's name?

35:09.444 --> 35:10.771
No. She's in a hurry.

35:11.099 --> 35:12.224
So the girl's hurt?

35:12.685 --> 35:14.729
Not hurt. Sick, I think.

35:14.825 --> 35:17.759
She's taking something. Her mother's holding a prescription bottle.

35:17.851 --> 35:18.885
Can you see anything?

35:23.141 --> 35:26.075
 "L-I-T-H."

35:26.822 --> 35:27.630
Lithium?

35:27.820 --> 35:29.397
Maybe. Does that help?

35:29.490 --> 35:31.757
Well, Lithium is a drug they give to manic depressives.

35:31.932 --> 35:34.056
Which means your girl is sick all right, but not with the flu.

35:34.118 --> 35:37.031
So maybe the doctor that the mother called was a psychiatrist.

35:37.380 --> 35:39.653
Which narrows down our search by a few thousand...

35:39.838 --> 35:42.713
It's a long shot, but I might be able to track the doctor through the prescription.

35:43.022 --> 35:47.192
If you're a pharmacist handing lithium to a minor, you might be inclined to remember...

35:47.266 --> 35:48.551
Excuse me. It's my precinct.

35:49.197 --> 35:50.083
Detective Scanlon.

35:51.890 --> 35:52.663
A doctor?

35:53.717 --> 35:54.695
A teenaged girl?

35:54.824 --> 35:55.663
I'll be right there.

35:56.370 --> 35:58.130
Seems like maybe your dream was a day off.

36:00.453 --> 36:01.204
Anybody home?

36:03.021 --> 36:04.173
What's cookin', good lookin'?

36:04.270 --> 36:04.987
Takeout.

36:06.699 --> 36:07.497
Where's your mommy?

36:08.223 --> 36:09.026
Bathroom.

36:10.245 --> 36:11.040
Go away.

36:19.072 --> 36:20.737
This time the girl was 13.

36:22.569 --> 36:24.736
I guess the doctor didn't have a scalpel

36:24.944 --> 36:28.604
because he used a rusty pair of scissors to cut her stomach open.

36:28.887 --> 36:31.294
Then he used his bare hands to rip her apart.

36:32.277 --> 36:33.752
Allison, it's not your fault.

36:33.879 --> 36:34.832
Yeah, it was.

36:35.010 --> 36:36.941
'Cause not only did I not save her,

36:37.151 --> 36:38.723
I didn't have any of it right.

36:39.122 --> 36:40.679
Her name wasn't Elisha.

36:40.838 --> 36:42.322
Her name was Melissa James.

36:42.482 --> 36:44.402
She wasn't white. She was African-American.

36:44.513 --> 36:47.181
I had the wrong name, I had the wrong face,

36:47.415 --> 36:49.434
I had the wrong damn date!

36:49.753 --> 36:52.588
Allison, just because you didn't know exactly...

36:52.661 --> 36:55.138
Joe, I didn't know anything.

36:55.865 --> 36:57.191
It was all for nothing.

36:58.568 --> 37:00.682
There's nobody left. There's nothing to learn.

37:00.862 --> 37:03.061
Somebody called security, the guard rushed in.

37:03.263 --> 37:04.492
He shot the doctor.

37:05.163 --> 37:07.210
The girl was already dead.

37:07.948 --> 37:12.801
And that monster is still out there, looking for a new cipher, looking for a new helper.

37:12.904 --> 37:14.338
You mean looking for a new victim.

37:15.434 --> 37:18.224
The doctors he uses, they're victims, too, aren't they?

37:19.207 --> 37:23.483
You just told me that today a doctor-- a good man, probably, before all this happened--

37:23.744 --> 37:26.699
did a horrible thing and died a terrible death because-- why?

37:26.775 --> 37:29.472
Because of some kind of a voice in his head.

37:30.010 --> 37:30.927
I think you're right.

37:31.023 --> 37:33.605
Thanks for pointing that out. Another meaningless victim.

37:33.804 --> 37:35.371
Well, what I'm trying to point out is,

37:35.520 --> 37:38.351
where does all this leave that doctor from your dream?

37:38.556 --> 37:41.422
I mean, if you think about it, he's the only victim that's still alive.

37:41.909 --> 37:43.302
And he is a victim.

37:43.532 --> 37:46.660
'Cause here's a man who's spending the rest of his life in a mental institution

37:46.737 --> 37:48.407
because he's convinced he's insane,

37:48.719 --> 37:49.645
or evil,

37:50.270 --> 37:53.147
when in fact all he really is, if I understand you correctly,

37:53.266 --> 37:56.190
is a little more... sensitive.

37:58.119 --> 37:59.685
So, what are you going to do about him?

38:00.060 --> 38:01.981
What do you want me to do about him?

38:02.323 --> 38:05.215
Well, I should think at the very least, you owe him an explanation.

38:05.365 --> 38:06.844
You want me to drive out there again?

38:06.941 --> 38:11.507
What makes you think that I won't find myself sitting across from Walker for the third time?

38:11.683 --> 38:13.608
I'm guessing Walker won't be there.

38:13.690 --> 38:14.657
He's moved on.

38:14.769 --> 38:16.198
He's done with Holloway.

38:16.878 --> 38:19.690
And if I'm wrong, and Dr. Walker is there,

38:20.074 --> 38:23.571
then you'll have the satisfaction of looking him straight in the eye

38:23.807 --> 38:25.163
and telling him to go...

38:29.127 --> 38:30.575
Nice to see you again.

38:32.593 --> 38:34.676
It's our fourth time actually.

38:37.300 --> 38:41.118
Dr. McGrath told me that you've been experiencing some "lost time" recently,

38:41.194 --> 38:44.434
and that you didn't remember our last few encounters.

38:52.079 --> 38:57.845
Mrs. Dubois, I am obviously a terribly ill man.

38:57.948 --> 39:02.541
If I have done or said anything to offend you,

39:02.622 --> 39:04.317
I am profoundly sorry.

39:04.767 --> 39:05.684
It's all right.

39:05.884 --> 39:06.842
I understand.

39:08.536 --> 39:10.206
You really weren't yourself.

39:12.648 --> 39:16.150
Which is what I came here to talk to you about.

39:20.676 --> 39:22.284
You've all been very helpful.

39:22.671 --> 39:25.397
This whole situation has been so hard.

39:47.432 --> 39:48.359
I've been, um...

39:49.557 --> 39:50.724
I don't want to....

39:53.090 --> 39:54.017
Please don't...

39:54.554 --> 39:55.830
I don't want...

39:56.102 --> 39:57.524
- Elisha?
- Please don't...

40:04.881 --> 40:06.024
Found me, eh?

40:09.291 --> 40:10.426
Nice to see you.

40:11.266 --> 40:13.627
I could do with a little adult company.

40:15.568 --> 40:16.904
She's 14.

40:17.918 --> 40:22.295
Her head's filled with awful music and the silliest ideas.

40:22.602 --> 40:24.204
Get out of her head.

40:24.589 --> 40:26.437
Not going to happen.

40:27.296 --> 40:28.942
You're too late.

40:29.033 --> 40:30.226
No, I don't think so.

40:30.411 --> 40:32.254
In fact, I think I'm right on time.

40:34.138 --> 40:36.616
She wasn't your next victim at all, was she?

40:37.716 --> 40:39.385
She's your new apprentice.

40:39.817 --> 40:41.336
Smart as a whip, too.

40:41.721 --> 40:44.838
Going to make a wonderful physician once we convince everybody

40:44.900 --> 40:47.113
that she's fine and get her out of here.

40:48.997 --> 40:51.194
Times have caught up with me, I'm afraid.

40:52.842 --> 40:54.998
The types of girls I want to ravage...

40:56.618 --> 40:59.001
they just don't go to male doctors anymore.

41:01.110 --> 41:02.375
You know what they say:

41:02.489 --> 41:03.461
adapt or die.

41:04.904 --> 41:06.123
Or, in my case,

41:06.921 --> 41:07.628
don't.

41:08.388 --> 41:09.712
You don't understand.

41:10.517 --> 41:12.196
I'm not going to let this happen.

41:12.396 --> 41:15.543
No, you're the one who doesn't understand.

41:16.138 --> 41:17.720
It's already happened.

41:19.021 --> 41:21.873
Oh, I know she's strong.

41:22.087 --> 41:23.347
She's fighting me...

41:24.821 --> 41:27.427
but I have nothing but time.

41:28.535 --> 41:32.025
And in the end, I'll win.

41:32.132 --> 41:33.495
You don't get it, do you?

41:34.068 --> 41:37.720
You only win because the people whose minds you seize

41:37.807 --> 41:39.783
don't understand what's happening to them.

41:40.229 --> 41:42.812
They live in fear and confusion.

41:43.064 --> 41:44.974
But I will come here every day.

41:45.234 --> 41:48.415
I will help Elisha understand that she's not going crazy.

41:48.948 --> 41:52.337
I will teach her not to be in fear of you but to hate you,

41:52.485 --> 41:54.846
to see you for what you really are--

41:55.000 --> 41:57.636
a pathetic and evil soul

41:57.718 --> 41:59.332
who has no place to go,

41:59.899 --> 42:01.225
an interloper,

42:01.599 --> 42:02.690
a parasite.

42:03.279 --> 42:05.178
If you think she's fighting you now...

42:06.851 --> 42:09.361
You may have all the time in the world,

42:09.484 --> 42:12.540
but how much of it are you willing to waste on a lost cause?

42:13.298 --> 42:16.453
Because Elisha is lost to you.

42:17.210 --> 42:19.146
I'll just find another one, you know.

42:20.025 --> 42:25.110
Why, there are three or four potentials that I'm monitoring right now.

42:25.186 --> 42:27.615
But you can't have her.

42:28.776 --> 42:30.804
You're going to leave her.

42:31.641 --> 42:33.215
Do you understand?

42:35.356 --> 42:37.952
Do you understand what I'm saying?!

42:39.027 --> 42:40.067
Tell me!

42:47.915 --> 42:48.750
Elisha?

42:50.292 --> 42:51.484
I don't hear him.

42:53.670 --> 42:55.365
I don't hear him at all.

42:57.162 --> 42:59.250
I don't hear anything inside except...

43:01.963 --> 43:02.834
me.
