WEBVTT

00:08.138 --> 00:09.444
<i>Wake up. Oh, my God.</i>

00:09.487 --> 00:12.664
Colton! Oh, my God, come on.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.623
Hey, you're okay.
Just focus on me.

00:14.666 --> 00:16.886
Just focus on me. Hey.

00:16.929 --> 00:19.280
Colton, wake up. Colton!

00:20.759 --> 00:22.848
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:23.458 --> 00:25.242
Put this under your head.

00:25.286 --> 00:26.635
We gotta call help.

00:26.678 --> 00:29.290
My phone is cracked.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.987
Um, stay here, okay?

00:31.031 --> 00:33.033
Don't move.

00:33.076 --> 00:34.512
- Stel?
- Uncle Liam?

00:34.556 --> 00:36.166
- Stel, what's going on?
- Hey, um, no, no, listen.

00:36.210 --> 00:37.646
We're at Hill Country
State Park.

00:37.689 --> 00:38.864
Something happened.

00:38.908 --> 00:40.083
I'm with Colton,
and we really need help...

00:43.521 --> 00:44.566
...right now.

01:03.846 --> 01:06.370
So you can see my
dilemma.

01:06.414 --> 01:09.286
Honestly, I stopped listening
about 30 seconds ago.

01:09.330 --> 01:11.549
Ye-- Okay.
So Stella told me

01:11.593 --> 01:13.203
she started seeing
the Davidson kid,

01:13.247 --> 01:15.510
which, of course, I support.
You know, I-I want to support.

01:15.553 --> 01:17.686
Right. Because you and Denise
used to <i>love</i> each other.

01:17.729 --> 01:19.905
No, no, we didn't--
We were kids.

01:19.949 --> 01:22.125
Yeah, well, I like that you felt
the need to engage on that.

01:22.169 --> 01:23.779
On the other hand,
if Liam and I are correct

01:23.822 --> 01:26.086
about this whole saddle thing,
then that changes everything

01:26.129 --> 01:28.088
and reignites the family feud.

01:28.131 --> 01:31.700
So what you're saying is
happy hour therapy?

01:31.743 --> 01:34.572
Yes, that is exactly
what I'm saying right now.

01:34.616 --> 01:36.531
Walker, my office, please.

01:37.836 --> 01:41.013
Not right now. Rain check.
But you'll think on my dilemma.

01:41.057 --> 01:42.928
- Yeah?
- Every waking hour, partner.

01:46.367 --> 01:48.238
- Cap.
- Yeah.

01:48.282 --> 01:50.414
Uh, you remember
Rita Vyas, right?

01:50.458 --> 01:52.590
Miles Vyas' wife. Yeah.

01:52.634 --> 01:53.591
You want me to grab Cass?

01:53.635 --> 01:56.028
No. Grab the door, actually.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.554
Of course.

01:59.597 --> 02:01.991
All right, you know
I don't like to

02:02.034 --> 02:04.559
admit that you
taught me something.

02:05.168 --> 02:07.083
But you did last year.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.737
- Okay.
- I learned that

02:08.780 --> 02:10.913
if one of my best Rangers has
a gut instinct about something,

02:10.956 --> 02:13.959
I should never completely
close that door.

02:14.003 --> 02:15.874
You were right about Emily,
right?

02:17.789 --> 02:21.880
Right. Are you thinking
Cass was right about Miles?

02:22.968 --> 02:24.100
Did you get a lead?

02:24.144 --> 02:25.188
I stayed in touch with Rita,

02:25.232 --> 02:26.581
just to kind of keep tabs,

02:26.624 --> 02:29.061
you know, just in case.

02:29.105 --> 02:31.847
She called me last night
about Captain Fenton.

02:31.890 --> 02:34.328
Said he's been acting erratic,

02:34.371 --> 02:36.243
leaving in the middle
of the night, et cetera.

02:36.286 --> 02:41.204
So Rita followed him, and she
saw him with someone.

02:41.248 --> 02:44.033
With-with Miles? Or saw him with
someone who looked like Miles?

02:44.076 --> 02:45.600
Well, she wouldn't go that far.
She didn't want to get caught.

02:45.643 --> 02:47.950
She got spooked,
but she gave me an address.

02:47.993 --> 02:50.692
Okay. Yeah, yeah,
let's run it down.

02:50.735 --> 02:53.782
Worst case, we give a widow
- some closure.
- Okay.

02:53.825 --> 02:55.436
But, uh, Cap...

02:55.479 --> 02:57.220
I know, I know,
you want to tell Cassie.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.701
Or at least understand
why we aren't.
Look,

02:59.744 --> 03:00.963
the spiral that I
saw you go through,

03:01.006 --> 03:02.356
that I helped put you through?

03:02.399 --> 03:03.922
I don't want
to kickstart that with her

03:03.966 --> 03:06.577
if this is just false hope.
Look, give me two hours.

03:06.621 --> 03:10.146
Two hours. If it's real,
she's the first call.

03:12.061 --> 03:13.715
You got it. Two hours.

03:13.758 --> 03:16.021
Let's do it.
All right.

03:19.677 --> 03:21.331
<i>Does that make it</i>

03:21.375 --> 03:22.419
an official date?

03:22.463 --> 03:24.029
We're grading on a curve,
William.

03:24.073 --> 03:25.205
I met Lucas when
we were 16.

03:25.248 --> 03:28.208
Oh, you are so not ready
for this,

03:28.251 --> 03:31.298
- and it is so charming.
- I'm sorry, what's that?

03:31.341 --> 03:33.430
Oh, not in a judgy way,

03:33.474 --> 03:35.127
it's just you seem
like a man

03:35.171 --> 03:37.826
of few long relationships
that likes to stretch

03:37.869 --> 03:40.568
what the definition
of a date is.

03:40.611 --> 03:43.223
You don't think I'm ready for
anything serious yet,

03:43.266 --> 03:45.964
which is supposed to
not be judgy.

03:46.008 --> 03:49.446
A number of things came out
wrong in this conversation.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.231
What gave it away?

03:51.274 --> 03:52.884
I'm sorry, it's just my head.
I'm just...

03:52.928 --> 03:55.800
I'm in a million places
right now.

03:57.106 --> 03:59.456
Well, I don't think
I'm gonna hear anything

03:59.500 --> 04:01.284
about your dating life

04:01.328 --> 04:03.982
till you tell me
whatever's going on.

04:04.940 --> 04:07.595
All right, let me guess.
The, uh, David family?

04:07.638 --> 04:08.770
Davidson.

04:08.813 --> 04:10.902
- What, Cassie told you?
- Yeah.

04:10.946 --> 04:12.774
- We're taking baby steps.
- Well,

04:12.817 --> 04:16.430
I'm starting to think
that they cheated

04:16.473 --> 04:19.041
in that horse race before.

04:19.084 --> 04:21.696
Cut a saddle.
If I'm right...

04:21.739 --> 04:23.567
It would nullify the agreement.

04:23.611 --> 04:25.047
The land would revert
to your family.

04:25.090 --> 04:26.831
Man, she really did
get you up to speed.

04:26.875 --> 04:29.312
Yeah. And-and this is gonna
sound selfish,

04:29.356 --> 04:31.445
but leaving the DA's office

04:31.488 --> 04:33.795
and dealing with
all this land deed,

04:33.838 --> 04:36.493
it hasn't exactly been
my year.

04:36.537 --> 04:40.541
I wouldn't hate putting a point
on the board with my family.

04:40.584 --> 04:42.325
That's not selfish.

04:42.369 --> 04:45.067
You're just saying that.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.677
The only issue I see is
you're talking to the wrong guy

04:46.721 --> 04:48.026
about the cheating.

04:48.070 --> 04:49.376
What are you saying,
that I should just go

04:49.419 --> 04:51.900
- straight at the Davidsons?
- Yeah.

04:51.943 --> 04:53.945
Sounds like you don't know
if someone was in it alone,

04:53.989 --> 04:55.425
or if the whole family
was in on it.

04:55.469 --> 04:57.775
You're a lawyer.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.951
Don't you depose people?

04:59.995 --> 05:02.302
Catch 'em in lies,
shake the trees?

05:02.345 --> 05:04.652
Say things like, "I'm gonna
nail your ass to this table."

05:04.695 --> 05:06.523
Oh, wow. We do not.

05:06.567 --> 05:10.135
We don't say "nail your ass
- to the table" in real life.
- Oh.

05:10.179 --> 05:13.661
But depose the Davidsons...

05:14.705 --> 05:17.665
That, I could do.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.465
Okay, game plan.

05:35.509 --> 05:37.380
It's a four-mile hike
there and back,

05:37.424 --> 05:39.426
and the app says
"moderately strenuous."

05:39.469 --> 05:41.602
Yeah. Moderately is a lie.

05:41.645 --> 05:43.865
Once "strenuous" comes
into play...

05:43.908 --> 05:45.170
Oh, you don't think
you can keep up?

05:45.214 --> 05:46.607
Oh, dude,
I can keep up.

05:48.130 --> 05:50.219
So you did this hike
with your mom?

05:50.262 --> 05:52.961
Not this one, but...

05:53.004 --> 05:56.138
hiking and camping,

05:56.181 --> 05:57.922
it was really big with her.

05:59.228 --> 06:02.057
I know this isn't
a normal first date...

06:02.100 --> 06:04.625
No, no, it's perfect.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.368
- Stel.

06:08.411 --> 06:11.414
You seriously only brought
SPF 15?

06:11.458 --> 06:13.285
It's like zero coverage.

06:13.329 --> 06:14.983
Almost perfect.

06:15.026 --> 06:16.201
Mm-hmm.

06:16.245 --> 06:17.420
All right, with this
I'm either bronzing

06:17.464 --> 06:18.813
or I'm burning. You know,

06:18.856 --> 06:20.205
it's a fast
- ride to burn.
- Hey, Augie,

06:20.249 --> 06:21.859
you said you were meeting
a friend here, right?

06:21.903 --> 06:25.559
Do you think maybe
you should go meet her?

06:25.602 --> 06:28.170
All right, all right,
I'm leaving. Whatever.

06:28.213 --> 06:29.606
Hey, Augie!

06:36.091 --> 06:38.310
Uh-huh.
Go be with your friend.

06:39.790 --> 06:41.270
And I'll see you
at the trail cutoff at 4:00.

06:42.271 --> 06:44.578
Got it.

06:46.014 --> 06:48.320
Ready to explore
the wilderness?

07:04.989 --> 07:06.426
Well, that don't look good.

07:06.469 --> 07:09.385
No. No, it doesn't.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.000
You don't live here anymore,
so you can't just show up

07:16.044 --> 07:17.698
- whenever you feel like it.
- I just have a question.

07:17.741 --> 07:19.656
- I just have one question to ask.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:19.700 --> 07:20.701
What's going on here?

07:20.744 --> 07:22.050
Our old neighbor here

07:22.093 --> 07:23.921
has some questions
about the race.

07:24.705 --> 07:27.490
We have reason to believe
that the race

07:27.534 --> 07:28.970
and the contract
that binds it

07:29.013 --> 07:30.841
is now null and void.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.147
Oh, God.

07:32.190 --> 07:33.670
And-and why would that be?

07:33.714 --> 07:37.544
Because a Davidson tampered
with Cordi's saddle.

07:37.587 --> 07:40.068
So I'm just here to find
out if one of you

07:40.111 --> 07:41.896
acted alone, or if
you're all in on it.

07:41.939 --> 07:44.115
Wow, you are incredible,
Liam, really.

07:44.159 --> 07:45.639
You must have proof.

07:45.682 --> 07:47.423
That is a very big thing to say.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.598
Oh, it's so interesting
that you'd be

07:48.642 --> 07:50.513
the first person
to go there, Daniel.

07:51.601 --> 07:54.212
Who had a bigger incentive
to tamper with this race?

07:54.256 --> 07:56.301
You get to impress
your family,

07:56.345 --> 07:57.694
you stay close to home.

07:57.738 --> 07:59.261
Okay, so you think Dan
cut the saddle?

07:59.304 --> 08:00.741
Really?

08:00.784 --> 08:02.525
You're reaching here.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.048
I didn't need to tip
the scales to win,

08:04.092 --> 08:06.007
and you didn't say anything
about proof.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.356
You know, ever since
the day of the race

08:07.399 --> 08:08.400
my father hasn't been
able to find

08:08.444 --> 08:09.967
his leather detailing knife.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.839
It's a pretty coincidental
leather-working tool

08:11.882 --> 08:13.928
to just go missing,
wouldn't you say?

08:13.971 --> 08:16.234
People lose things
in a move, Liam.

08:16.278 --> 08:18.280
Maybe you used it, and then
you threw away the evidence.

08:18.323 --> 08:19.281
Oh, yeah. Mmm.

08:19.324 --> 08:20.369
You've never been good

08:20.412 --> 08:21.718
with probable cause.

08:21.762 --> 08:22.719
Oh, yeah?
And who was right about that?

08:22.763 --> 08:24.765
You broke my taillight.

08:24.808 --> 08:26.636
That cost me $200.

08:26.680 --> 08:29.726
And as far as I can tell,
that cost you a career.

08:31.380 --> 08:33.774
You know that that race
was your lifeline

08:33.817 --> 08:36.341
to stay in a family that didn't
even want you anymore.

08:36.385 --> 08:40.302
criminal, liar.

08:40.345 --> 08:42.783
Why not just throw "cheat"
into the mix,

08:42.826 --> 08:44.088
and you'd get the guest house?

08:44.132 --> 08:45.568
Oh, my God.

08:45.612 --> 08:48.397
I came to you to try
and call off this race,

08:48.440 --> 08:50.355
and instead, you rigged it.

08:50.399 --> 08:52.444
Just shows what kind
of man you are.

08:52.488 --> 08:53.445
Okay, you know what,
that's enough.

08:53.489 --> 08:54.838
You don't just come over...

08:54.882 --> 08:56.710
- I'm not trying to hide my play!
- Liam!

08:56.753 --> 08:59.321
Your job is to know when
people are lying, right?

08:59.364 --> 09:01.018
'Cause I've seen
that look before.

09:01.062 --> 09:02.542
That look is defeat.

09:02.585 --> 09:03.934
It's the same look
your brother had

09:03.978 --> 09:05.806
when I won that race.

09:07.155 --> 09:08.373
We're not lying.

09:10.027 --> 09:11.681
Admit it.

09:19.689 --> 09:22.823
Why didn't you come to me
with this saddle business first?

09:25.521 --> 09:27.262
Cordi and I didn't
want to...
Oh...

09:27.305 --> 09:28.829
we didn't want to give you
false hope

09:28.872 --> 09:30.265
if we couldn't deliver.

09:30.308 --> 09:33.224
Well, hell, your brother's
wrapped up in this?

09:33.268 --> 09:35.575
This why the sudden interest
- in my tools?
- Daddy,

09:35.618 --> 09:37.489
your leather detailing knife
just goes missing?

09:37.533 --> 09:38.839
I mean, you're so meticulous.

09:38.882 --> 09:40.623
You must have
thought about this.

09:40.667 --> 09:43.017
Did it ever dawn on you that I'm
trying not to think about it?

09:43.887 --> 09:45.236
That every time I do
it makes it that much

09:45.280 --> 09:47.587
harder for me to make peace
with the fact that

09:47.630 --> 09:50.067
that I'm working
my family's old land?

09:50.111 --> 09:51.852
I-I'm sorry, I wasn't...

09:51.895 --> 09:53.505
Your heart's in the right place,
son, it's just that

09:53.549 --> 09:55.333
we don't need this acrimony.

09:55.377 --> 09:57.553
They are lying to us, Dad.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.860
I just need to peel
one of 'em off.

10:04.691 --> 10:07.084
Hey, Bonham, can we talk
for a second?

10:07.128 --> 10:10.305
Should've seen this coming.

10:13.700 --> 10:16.311
I mean, look, it's not that
I don't appreciate everything,

10:16.354 --> 10:17.312
but, um...

10:17.355 --> 10:19.401
Yep.

10:19.444 --> 10:22.099
It means a lot.
All you've done for the ranch.

10:22.143 --> 10:24.580
Thank you, Bonham.

10:25.973 --> 10:28.889
"Mr. Walker" is fine.

10:30.368 --> 10:32.457
Ooh!

10:32.501 --> 10:33.807
Told you not to
mess with me. Huh?

10:33.850 --> 10:35.852
All right, all right.
Uh-huh. Okay.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.637
Well, bar games aside,

10:37.680 --> 10:39.726
it sounds to me like
you're at a crossroads.

10:39.769 --> 10:43.077
- No, it's-it's not like that.
- Mm.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.905
Isn't it, though?

10:44.948 --> 10:47.690
My lease is up at the bungalow
and I need a new apartment.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.605
- Mm-hmm.
- That's pretty straightforward.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.476
Right.
Not to mention I
think somebody here

10:51.520 --> 10:53.000
might be projecting.

10:53.043 --> 10:56.656
You're still living
out of that motel off Lamar,

10:56.699 --> 10:57.918
crossroads.

10:57.961 --> 11:01.617
Well, for your information,
I'm not.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.272
They're shutting it down.

11:04.315 --> 11:06.143
Damn.

11:06.187 --> 11:07.449
They want you out that bad?

11:07.492 --> 11:09.538
Hey!

11:12.541 --> 11:15.196
Oh... yes!

11:15.239 --> 11:17.328
- Still got it.
- Hell yeah.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.853
- Oh, I'm so happy you're here!
- Yes.

11:19.896 --> 11:22.072
All right, uh, Angela,
this is Trey.

11:22.116 --> 11:25.206
Trey, this is Angela.
She is, among other things,

11:25.249 --> 11:27.295
about to kick your ass
in darts.

11:27.338 --> 11:29.079
Okay, it is on.
Mm-hmm.

11:29.123 --> 11:31.386
All right? Pleasure
to meet you, Angela.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.649
Well, thank you for the invite.
Yeah.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.346
The shift I just had was...

11:35.390 --> 11:36.739
Yeah, I-I got it.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.393
- Another round on me.
Yes.

11:40.395 --> 11:41.788
So...

11:41.831 --> 11:43.354
Yeah.
What kind of shift
we talking?

11:43.398 --> 11:45.792
- Uh, Children's Hospital.
- Ooh.

11:45.835 --> 11:49.447
Man, that's, wow. Respect.

11:49.491 --> 11:50.710
Yeah.
What line of work?

11:51.754 --> 11:54.801
Helos. Yeah.
EMS choppers, mostly.

11:54.844 --> 11:55.932
You know,
split time between them

11:55.976 --> 11:57.020
and flying for Austin Rescue.

11:57.064 --> 12:00.023
You... heard of us?

12:00.067 --> 12:01.590
The search and rescue outfit?

12:01.633 --> 12:04.549
Yeah. Of-of course
I've heard of you.

12:04.593 --> 12:07.074
Y'all saved that, um,
that football team,

12:07.117 --> 12:09.859
when their bus drove into the
- Brazos River last week, right?
- Yes.

12:09.903 --> 12:12.993
But at 2-8, did they really
deserve it?

12:13.036 --> 12:15.604
I guess that's debatable.

12:15.647 --> 12:17.127
Yeah.

12:18.476 --> 12:20.652
Uh, you want to...
Yeah, yeah.

12:20.696 --> 12:21.697
See what you got.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.568
- Ooh, yes.
- Yeah.

12:25.309 --> 12:27.659
Hey, so we're straight up
mountain climbing now.

12:27.703 --> 12:29.836
Hey, you're the one
who just had to do

12:29.879 --> 12:32.229
the Starr Valley Trail
last minute.

12:32.273 --> 12:33.578
Should we turn back?

12:33.622 --> 12:37.234
Why? You afraid of
a little climb?

12:37.278 --> 12:39.759
Oh, it always has to be a race
between our families, huh?

12:39.802 --> 12:41.673
Oh, so now this is a race?

12:41.717 --> 12:43.371
Got it.

12:43.414 --> 12:46.287
Hey, you see those flowers?

12:49.464 --> 12:51.988
Oh, Stella,
I-I'm so flattered,

12:52.032 --> 12:54.164
but you can't pick
anything in a park.

12:54.208 --> 12:57.341
No, I mean fastest one there.

12:57.385 --> 12:58.821
I'll even give you honors.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.649
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

13:00.692 --> 13:02.564
Okay.

13:06.394 --> 13:08.091
- Ready?
- Yeah.

13:08.135 --> 13:10.572
Set... go!

13:17.579 --> 13:20.016
Seven, eight, nine.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.844
Not bad.

13:32.637 --> 13:36.728
17, 18, 19...

13:36.772 --> 13:37.773
I'm here, I got it.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.993
- These?
- Uh-huh.

13:41.168 --> 13:42.430
The things I do...

13:57.271 --> 13:59.012
Colton?! Oh, my God.

13:59.055 --> 14:01.275
Oh, my God. Colton?

14:01.318 --> 14:04.539
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
That was close.

14:04.582 --> 14:06.323
You don't look okay.
You're bleeding.

14:07.803 --> 14:09.544
No, we gotta go.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.285
We gotta keep going.

14:11.328 --> 14:13.504
No. Um, let's get to your mom.
She's waiting for us.

14:13.548 --> 14:14.592
Colton?

14:16.638 --> 14:19.380
No, we're alone
in the middle of nowhere.

14:20.598 --> 14:21.861
And my mom...

14:23.993 --> 14:27.518
Colton?! Colton?

14:28.737 --> 14:31.087
Colton. Wake up. Colton!

14:33.611 --> 14:34.612
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

14:34.656 --> 14:35.962
We gotta call help.

14:36.005 --> 14:38.399
Um... Stay here, okay?

14:38.442 --> 14:39.922
Don't move.

14:42.011 --> 14:43.621
- Stel?
- Uncle Liam?

14:43.665 --> 14:44.927
- Stel. What's going on here?
- Hey. Um, no, no, listen.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.189
We're at Hill Country
State Park.

14:46.233 --> 14:47.625
Something happened.

14:47.669 --> 14:49.323
I'm with Colton,
and we really need help...

14:51.455 --> 14:53.066
...right now.

15:01.074 --> 15:02.640
Ah, damn it. Stella,
how are you this late?

15:02.684 --> 15:04.512
You've been saying that
for half an hour,

15:04.555 --> 15:06.427
and you still don't have
any bars.

15:06.470 --> 15:08.429
Okay, you know what,
maybe she just got

15:08.472 --> 15:09.996
overly ambitious on a trail.

15:10.039 --> 15:11.519
Or they're off sucking face,

15:11.562 --> 15:13.347
and super don't want you around.

15:13.390 --> 15:14.739
Definitely did not need
that image.

15:14.783 --> 15:16.045
We're supposed to meet everyone

15:16.089 --> 15:17.481
at the Continental Club,

15:17.525 --> 15:19.179
and we're already
gonna be late.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.355
I'm gonna run.

15:21.398 --> 15:22.965
Are you sure you want
to stay here?

15:27.361 --> 15:29.189
I'm sorry, I really have to

15:29.232 --> 15:31.626
go find my sister, mostly so
I can kill her for this.

15:32.627 --> 15:35.282
Okay, Augie,
good luck.

15:40.026 --> 15:42.637
Okay, what did she say, exactly?

15:42.680 --> 15:44.987
- It was only seven seconds.
- Well, in those seven seconds.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.467
She said she's in the park
with Colton,

15:46.510 --> 15:49.209
and she didn't say this,
but August is there, too.

15:49.252 --> 15:50.253
We're looking at
a thousand acres.

15:50.297 --> 15:52.125
At least we know the terrain.

15:52.168 --> 15:53.561
Well, Stella knows
not to go off trail,

15:53.604 --> 15:54.649
so that narrows it down.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.958
Anything else from the kids?

15:59.001 --> 16:01.090
- Not since the SOS.
- We'll just see you out there.

16:01.134 --> 16:02.570
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

16:02.613 --> 16:04.702
Okay, whatever has
gone on between us,

16:04.746 --> 16:06.095
it's our kids out there.

16:06.139 --> 16:09.011
We've got long-range radios,
all right?

16:09.055 --> 16:10.491
What do you say
we divide and conquer?

16:10.534 --> 16:12.536
Yeah, sure. Uh, what did you
have in mind?

16:12.580 --> 16:14.712
Well, um, uh, Bonham and I will
stay and make base camp.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.453
You guys can use your truck
to go off road,

16:16.497 --> 16:19.587
and Liam, he'll hoof it.
Use channel three.

16:19.630 --> 16:21.981
Hey, wait! Hey, Dan!

16:22.024 --> 16:23.069
All the kids, Dan.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.722
Yes, all the kids, Liam.

16:24.766 --> 16:26.550
I'm not drawing lines
with the family.

16:26.594 --> 16:28.683
All the kids!
Okay. I'm glad
we're on the same page.

16:33.731 --> 16:35.255
Has anyone been able to
get ahold of Cordell?

16:35.298 --> 16:36.734
I mean, I've been trying
to reach him.

16:39.085 --> 16:41.739
Well, looks pretty
damned abandoned to me.

16:41.783 --> 16:44.916
Well, who knows?
Maybe Captain Fenton was

16:44.960 --> 16:47.789
using it as a safe
house for his CIs.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.974
All right, I'll see if
anyone's inside.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.410
But, uh...Yeah. I don't know,

17:00.454 --> 17:02.499
maybe Rita was
jumping at ghosts, huh?

17:02.543 --> 17:03.979
Yeah.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.676
Okay, check it out.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.461
Yes, sir.

17:15.469 --> 17:17.993
Texas Rangers, open up.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.055
Texas Rangers!

17:57.163 --> 17:58.773
Cap, um...

18:00.079 --> 18:01.341
...you're gonna want
to see this.

18:47.691 --> 18:49.084
Liam knows no bottom.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.999
No, but you handled it fine.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.002
You know, I saw the way
you looked at me

18:54.045 --> 18:55.656
when he said that
I cut the saddle.

18:55.699 --> 18:57.701
Will you please just
focus on Colton?

18:57.745 --> 19:00.182
You think I did it, don't you?

19:02.663 --> 19:05.361
Look, you don't want me to say
the quiet parts out loud, so...

19:05.405 --> 19:08.103
What does that mean?

19:10.236 --> 19:13.674
I don't know. Earl.
The cameras.

19:13.717 --> 19:15.980
Going behind my back
to get a plea deal.

19:16.024 --> 19:17.373
I think that cheating
is right there

19:17.417 --> 19:19.114
in your wheelhouse.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.421
And you haven't even said
that you didn't do it yet.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.423
And can you please
just think of Colton?

19:23.466 --> 19:25.686
He needs one parent
that can show up

19:25.729 --> 19:27.166
and be responsible.

19:27.209 --> 19:29.994
Will one person just
believe me when I speak?

19:32.606 --> 19:35.435
Colton! Stella, hey!

19:37.132 --> 19:41.789
Colton, Stella,
your rescue party is here and...

19:46.141 --> 19:47.708
...lost.

19:47.751 --> 19:49.710
Stella.

19:51.755 --> 19:53.366
Stella?

19:54.584 --> 19:57.152
Is that August? August!

19:58.632 --> 20:00.329
August! Hey.
Augie!

20:00.373 --> 20:01.504
- Hey.
- Whoa!

20:04.159 --> 20:05.421
- Oh, my God.
- August!

20:05.465 --> 20:06.857
- Augie!
- Help. Help!

20:06.901 --> 20:08.163
Help!

20:08.207 --> 20:10.774
August! August!

20:14.517 --> 20:15.562
August!

20:22.308 --> 20:24.832
August!

20:24.875 --> 20:26.355
Help! Ah...Hold on!

20:26.399 --> 20:27.356
Help!I'm coming!

20:27.400 --> 20:29.924
August, hang in there!

20:37.366 --> 20:39.194
Oh. I got you.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.457
I got you. Turn,
turn over on your back.

20:41.501 --> 20:43.242
Okay? Kick. I got you.

20:46.070 --> 20:47.246
Kick.

20:47.289 --> 20:49.248
Kick. There you go.

20:55.558 --> 20:57.952
- Are you okay?
- What are you doing here?

20:59.997 --> 21:02.304
Actually, you know what,
who cares? I'm glad you're here.

21:02.348 --> 21:03.958
Are you okay?

21:04.567 --> 21:06.482
Look, your sister called.
She could be in trouble.

21:06.526 --> 21:08.397
Do you know where she is?

21:08.441 --> 21:11.879
Look, we were supposed
to meet here at 4:00.

21:11.922 --> 21:14.055
She and Colton were late,
so I headed here.

21:14.098 --> 21:15.491
- I know where they're headed.
- Let's go.

21:18.712 --> 21:20.627
All right, we've got August.

21:20.670 --> 21:21.802
Pulled him out of some rapids.

21:21.845 --> 21:23.369
Denise is taking him
back to base camp.

21:23.412 --> 21:25.936
Stella and Colton are on
the Scenic Overlook Hike.

21:25.980 --> 21:27.068
I'm headed to the trail.

21:27.111 --> 21:28.722
Copy that. I'll meet you there.

21:35.076 --> 21:38.122
Okay, we've got to apply
pressure to stop the bleeding.

21:38.166 --> 21:41.300
No, I know. I think I'm gonna
close my eyes for a little bit.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.389
No. The last thing
that you should do is sleep.

21:43.432 --> 21:44.738
I think you have a concussion.

21:44.781 --> 21:46.348
What, even if I'm tired?

21:46.392 --> 21:48.307
Especially.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.134
Hey, just look at me.

21:51.571 --> 21:53.268
I kinda want to keep you around.

21:54.269 --> 21:56.010
Why? Because you like me?

22:03.452 --> 22:05.802
Stel, you think we're cursed?

22:06.847 --> 22:09.240
Starting to feel that way,
isn't it?

22:10.459 --> 22:12.853
But cursed brought us together,
so...

22:12.896 --> 22:14.942
Well, here's to cursed.

22:16.422 --> 22:19.816
- Ow.
- Okay. Um, maybe
no more toasts.

22:19.860 --> 22:22.297
Yeah.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.473
Stella!

22:24.517 --> 22:25.996
Colton!

22:27.389 --> 22:28.651
Stella!

22:28.695 --> 22:30.653
Colton!

22:30.697 --> 22:32.481
Stella!

22:34.744 --> 22:37.138
Hey, we're down here!

22:37.181 --> 22:38.966
Colton's hurt,
and he needs a medic!

22:39.009 --> 22:40.489
Okay, okay. Hey!

22:40.533 --> 22:42.448
Stay right there, okay?
I'm gonna be right down!

22:42.491 --> 22:44.101
Oh, my God.

22:48.018 --> 22:49.759
Whoa, whoa.

22:49.803 --> 22:51.413
The hell are you doing? You're
gonna get yourself killed.

22:51.457 --> 22:52.719
No, Colton is down there

22:52.762 --> 22:54.416
- and needs our help.
- Colt-- Colton!

22:54.460 --> 22:56.723
- Colton, are you okay, son?
I don't know!

22:56.766 --> 22:58.420
He's been in and out
of consciousness!

22:58.464 --> 23:00.030
All right,
I'm coming down there!

23:00.074 --> 23:02.032
Okay. Okay, we need
a plan. We can't...

23:02.076 --> 23:04.034
We can't free-climb this.
- It's too dangerous.
- I know. I know.

23:04.078 --> 23:07.124
Uh, the trail's
- gonna take an hour.
- I know, I know. You're right.

23:07.168 --> 23:08.648
Colton might not
have an hour.

23:08.691 --> 23:09.779
I have an idea.

23:09.823 --> 23:11.259
Oh, what do you suggest?

23:13.348 --> 23:14.915
You are so full of it.

23:14.958 --> 23:17.091
- What?

23:17.134 --> 23:18.614
What?

23:18.658 --> 23:20.181
Seriously,
it was not a setup.

23:20.224 --> 23:21.443
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

23:21.487 --> 23:23.663
Though now
I kind of wish it was.

23:23.706 --> 23:25.404
You're my two
most badass friends.

23:25.447 --> 23:27.057
Come on.

23:27.101 --> 23:28.581
You want to hear a joke?

23:28.624 --> 23:31.322
I just don't know if I'm ready
for all that yet.

23:31.366 --> 23:33.281
Because of the lease.

23:33.324 --> 23:36.502
Because the bungalow might be
about more than just a lease,

23:36.545 --> 23:38.068
- yes.
- Oh, I knew it.

23:38.112 --> 23:39.809
And you said I was projecting.

23:39.853 --> 23:41.507
- Which I was.
- Ha!

23:41.550 --> 23:44.292
But, also, I was right,
because I can be all the things.

23:45.293 --> 23:48.252
Look, nothing's wrong
with hurting, Trey.

23:48.296 --> 23:51.081
It's the lying to yourself
that's gonna mess you up.

23:52.692 --> 23:54.650
Mm.

23:54.694 --> 23:56.696
Liam. What's good?

23:57.871 --> 23:59.742
Wait, wh-where are you?

24:00.917 --> 24:03.442
Uh, yeah,
we're-we're on our way.

24:03.485 --> 24:05.269
- Oh, excuse me.
- Um, I think I
can do you one better

24:05.313 --> 24:06.836
than Ranger resources.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.185
What happened?

24:08.229 --> 24:09.491
We have a problem.

24:09.535 --> 24:11.406
- So...

24:11.450 --> 24:13.713
how far is your helicopter?

24:20.328 --> 24:21.590
You're sure it's okay,
us joining like this?

24:21.634 --> 24:23.505
We're all volunteers.

24:23.549 --> 24:25.159
A lot of ex-military like you.

24:25.202 --> 24:26.813
The Bat-Signal goes up
to all rescuers,

24:26.856 --> 24:27.857
and whoever's available

24:27.901 --> 24:28.902
gets to work.

24:28.945 --> 24:30.381
Disasters.
Missing children.

24:30.425 --> 24:32.732
Swift water rescues.
You name it,

24:32.775 --> 24:34.821
we do it. And pretty damn well.

24:34.864 --> 24:37.345
Well, unless you aren't up
for it. I can get you

24:37.388 --> 24:39.216
a name tag and a welcome gift
when we're back.

24:39.260 --> 24:42.306
High altitudes
are definitely my thing.

24:42.350 --> 24:44.961
- Mm.
- Back in Kandahar, they used
to call me Tip-Top-Trey.

24:45.005 --> 24:46.833
Okay, then.

24:46.876 --> 24:48.312
Load in.

24:48.356 --> 24:49.531
- Sure think.
- All right.

24:49.575 --> 24:51.315
Well, after you, Tip-Top.

24:51.359 --> 24:53.753
Thanks, Angela.
You got it.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.668
Okay.

24:57.278 --> 24:58.801
Whoa, whoa. Check.

25:02.588 --> 25:05.112
- Check. Check.
- That's everything?

25:05.155 --> 25:06.896
Saving.
This is Tom.

25:06.940 --> 25:08.463
Tom, Trey Barnett.

25:08.507 --> 25:11.335
Cassie Perez. With the Rangers.

25:11.379 --> 25:14.643
Uh, you fly out of
- Children's Hospital, too?
- Nope.

25:14.687 --> 25:17.167
Fifth grade English.
10th St. Elementary.

25:17.211 --> 25:19.692
- Oh.
- And this is Steve.
He's our crew chief.

25:21.650 --> 25:22.825
And a paralegal.

25:22.869 --> 25:23.826
- Hey, Steve.
- Hey.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.438
Oh, God.

25:27.482 --> 25:29.528
Is this a, uh...
Is this a terrible time

25:29.571 --> 25:31.051
to mention
I'm afraid of heights?

25:31.094 --> 25:33.227
You go to the climbing
gym, like, every week.

25:33.270 --> 25:35.098
Yeah, exactly. Indoors.

25:35.142 --> 25:36.883
Not in a giant hunk of metal

25:36.926 --> 25:38.101
that's blowing
around in the breeze

25:38.145 --> 25:39.712
that could kill me
at any minute.

25:39.755 --> 25:41.322
Really kicking us off
with the good vibes, Cass.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.455
Well, good news.
Comms work.

25:45.456 --> 25:47.241
- I have the controls.
- You have the controls.

25:47.284 --> 25:48.416
Oh, my God.

25:59.035 --> 26:00.689
Hey

26:30.850 --> 26:32.155
Y'all ready?

26:32.199 --> 26:33.635
We're just a few klicks
from the location.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.348
Lighting the torch.

27:01.271 --> 27:02.577
Wind's picking up.

27:02.621 --> 27:03.839
You doing all right
back there?

27:03.883 --> 27:05.145
- Yep.
- Oh, yeah.

27:05.188 --> 27:06.276
- We're good.
- Yeah.

27:13.457 --> 27:15.242
They're on their way.

27:15.285 --> 27:17.244
Just a little while longer,
okay?

27:17.287 --> 27:20.247
Most memorable first date ever.

27:20.290 --> 27:22.162
I think your memory

27:22.205 --> 27:24.251
is gonna be a little spotty
on this one.

27:39.222 --> 27:40.702
Hey!

27:40.746 --> 27:42.138
Got 'em.

27:47.013 --> 27:49.015
We need to get those kids up
in a harness.

27:50.146 --> 27:51.626
Hello?!

27:51.670 --> 27:53.323
Down here!

27:53.367 --> 27:54.760
Come on, Tip-Top.

27:54.803 --> 27:56.718
This is you.

27:58.938 --> 28:00.940
Ready the rope.

28:14.605 --> 28:17.347
You have done this before,
right?

28:31.622 --> 28:32.754
Stella!

28:32.798 --> 28:34.669
Oh, Stella.
Are you okay?

28:34.713 --> 28:36.758
I'm good. Yeah, he took a fall
- straight to the head.
- You're good?

28:36.802 --> 28:38.978
- Okay. No, no, no.
- I tried to stop
the bleeding, keep him awake,

28:39.021 --> 28:40.544
but...You're good.
You're good, okay?

28:40.588 --> 28:43.199
Everything you two did
is great. Hey, Colton,

28:43.243 --> 28:45.114
I need you to
track this for me.

28:52.992 --> 28:55.211
All right, Stella.
Help me load him up.

29:01.914 --> 29:03.872
There you go.

29:07.833 --> 29:09.573
Let me get the rope.

29:15.101 --> 29:17.668
Patient's secured!
Pull him up!

30:31.786 --> 30:33.179
I'm fine.

30:33.222 --> 30:36.008
I'm just...
I'm really sorry about all this.

30:36.051 --> 30:37.705
Oh, it's fine, sweetie.
We just...

30:37.748 --> 30:39.098
We're just glad

30:39.141 --> 30:40.316
and happy that you're okay.

30:40.360 --> 30:41.840
Stella Walker.

30:41.883 --> 30:44.799
That was some real grace
under fire back there.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.758
It's mostly
just what Coach taught me.

30:48.759 --> 30:49.978
Thank you

30:50.022 --> 30:51.240
for everything.

30:52.589 --> 30:54.026
He's gonna be okay, right?

30:54.069 --> 30:55.679
Yeah, I...

30:55.723 --> 30:57.899
I think so.
Because of what you did.

30:57.943 --> 30:59.379
Mm-hmm.

30:59.422 --> 31:01.033
Cass here knows
how to get ahold of me.

31:01.076 --> 31:04.297
If you ever want to fly with us,
don't be a stranger.

31:06.168 --> 31:08.170
That goes for you, too.

31:28.234 --> 31:30.497
Any update from the EMTs?

31:30.540 --> 31:33.239
Uh, they said concussion.

31:33.282 --> 31:36.459
The, uh, bleeding should stop
with some stitches.

31:36.503 --> 31:39.201
Think we avoided
the worst-case scenario there.

31:39.245 --> 31:41.551
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

31:42.770 --> 31:45.120
Listen, Dan...

31:46.165 --> 31:49.168
We were never meant
to be friends, were we?

31:49.211 --> 31:51.866
Hands we were dealt.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.650
I mean, it's funny
to think about, though.

31:53.694 --> 31:57.045
- Yeah.

31:57.089 --> 31:59.918
Yeah, me as your attorney
in Thalia?

32:03.182 --> 32:06.141
Well, you got to get
to the hospital.

32:06.185 --> 32:08.230
Yeah. Should get to your niece.

32:08.274 --> 32:09.797
Yeah.

32:12.060 --> 32:14.019
Look, I-I got to say,

32:14.062 --> 32:15.759
Dan,

32:15.803 --> 32:18.066
that first punch,

32:18.110 --> 32:20.199
that first domino
between us...

32:20.242 --> 32:23.854
It could've been different. I...

32:23.898 --> 32:27.075
Well, like you said, those are
- the hands we were dealt.
- Yeah.

32:27.119 --> 32:29.077
Well,

32:29.121 --> 32:31.123
thank you.

32:31.166 --> 32:33.603
Really. For today.

32:34.604 --> 32:36.345
You know, I, um,

32:36.389 --> 32:40.001
I might've goaded you
- into that first sucker punch.
- Oh.

32:40.045 --> 32:41.350
Now he admits.

32:41.394 --> 32:43.091
It was your fault, though.

32:56.626 --> 32:58.237
Wow.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.935
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.284
Hey.

33:02.328 --> 33:03.894
Decided to pull the trigger?

33:03.938 --> 33:05.809
Yep.
Wow.

33:05.853 --> 33:09.161
Just gotta officially
sign the lease at the, uh...

33:09.204 --> 33:10.162
The Berryhill.

33:10.205 --> 33:11.424
Yeah.
Wow.

33:11.467 --> 33:12.642
That sounds stately.

33:12.686 --> 33:14.122
What is it, an English manor?

33:15.558 --> 33:16.733
Lord Barnett.

33:21.347 --> 33:26.178
Well, I, uh... I took my
own PhD advice, too.

33:26.221 --> 33:27.353
Yeah?

33:27.396 --> 33:28.615
Did a little
apartment hunting.

33:28.658 --> 33:31.661
No home runs yet, but...Huh.

33:31.705 --> 33:34.621
Well, look at us
- closing up chapters.
- Yeah.

33:34.664 --> 33:37.711
Well, just gotta figure out
- where the next place will be.
- Mm.

33:37.754 --> 33:40.279
Maybe the Berryhill.

33:41.671 --> 33:44.500
Okay, wait.
Are you pitching roommates?

33:46.024 --> 33:47.677
Hell no.

33:47.721 --> 33:50.332
Oh...No, no. No, no,
no, no, no. Look.

33:50.376 --> 33:53.118
Maybe a couple of floors apart
wouldn't suck.

33:54.989 --> 33:57.992
- Ah. Crap. James needs me.
- Duty calls.

33:58.036 --> 34:00.429
I will schedule
- a tour of that place.
- Okay.

34:00.473 --> 34:01.691
Later, roomie.

34:01.735 --> 34:03.258
- Absolutely not.
- Uh-huh.

34:03.302 --> 34:06.044
- No, that is not a thing.
- It's happening.

34:35.160 --> 34:37.292
He's resting.

34:37.336 --> 34:40.121
Ugh. Colton dating a Walker

34:40.165 --> 34:43.603
is definitely gonna be eventful.

34:43.646 --> 34:46.823
Yeah. You know, there's, um,

34:46.867 --> 34:50.305
there's something I've been
turning over about that.

34:50.349 --> 34:52.177
The Walkers.

34:54.004 --> 34:56.355
I mean, that's all
- we ever do, isn't it?
- Yeah.

34:56.398 --> 34:59.358
I mean, after all these years,
Denise,

34:59.401 --> 35:00.794
I can still misread you.

35:02.230 --> 35:03.449
When Liam came over,
I thought I saw

35:03.492 --> 35:05.407
accusation in your eyes.

35:05.451 --> 35:06.843
And I'm used to that,
I guess,

35:06.887 --> 35:08.149
just being on the wrong side
of things,

35:08.193 --> 35:10.412
but that wasn't it, was it?

35:10.456 --> 35:12.022
It was recognition.

35:12.066 --> 35:16.070
You know, Liam knocked over
that first domino,

35:16.114 --> 35:18.986
but you and that look,
that was the second one.

35:19.029 --> 35:21.249
Oh, look...

35:22.729 --> 35:25.514
...we are both sleep-deprived,

35:25.558 --> 35:27.603
and you're not making
any sense.

35:27.647 --> 35:28.909
You're not answering
the question.

35:30.432 --> 35:32.173
You're talking about dominoes.
It...

35:32.217 --> 35:34.175
Where's the question?

35:34.219 --> 35:36.743
You did it.

35:36.786 --> 35:38.223
You cut the saddle,
didn't you?

35:38.266 --> 35:41.443
What? We won. You won.

35:41.487 --> 35:42.966
What are--
What are we talking...

35:43.010 --> 35:46.056
Because you tried to get me
to take the fall.

35:46.100 --> 35:47.841
That is revisionist.

35:47.884 --> 35:49.408
No, no, no, it's smart.

35:49.451 --> 35:50.713
Because I'm the one
with the record,

35:50.757 --> 35:52.454
and you're squeaky clean.

35:52.498 --> 35:55.109
And everything that I've done
for this family, <i>everything,</i>

35:55.153 --> 35:56.893
hasn't made a lick of
difference to you.

35:56.937 --> 35:58.591
No one is saying that.

35:58.634 --> 36:00.593
Yes, you're saying it.

36:00.636 --> 36:02.508
And you know you're saying it.

36:03.770 --> 36:04.771
Dan.

36:04.814 --> 36:06.686
Dan, don't leave.

36:08.775 --> 36:10.951
Please.

36:20.830 --> 36:23.398
You know,
one of these days

36:23.442 --> 36:25.183
we're gonna have a date
that doesn't involve

36:25.226 --> 36:28.142
an audible or a make-up.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.100
Or a legal brainstorm.

36:30.144 --> 36:31.798
Or anybody being judgy.

36:31.841 --> 36:33.974
Well, me being judgy.

36:34.017 --> 36:36.977
I seem to do that with people.
It's something I should work on.

36:37.020 --> 36:39.762
Well, part of you is right.

36:39.806 --> 36:43.113
Am I ready for
something serious?

36:43.157 --> 36:45.159
Almost certainly not.

36:45.203 --> 36:48.467
So I get to take back
that apology.
No.

36:48.510 --> 36:49.859
No, let's keep it on the table

36:49.903 --> 36:51.296
for the next time
you screw up.

36:54.516 --> 36:58.128
I'm also saying you're
just as much of a mess as I am.

37:00.174 --> 37:01.480
You know, in this moment,

37:01.523 --> 37:05.048
I do feel quite messy.

37:09.966 --> 37:11.490
Then we're on the same page.

37:13.143 --> 37:15.015
That's perfect.

37:26.026 --> 37:27.941
William, you here?

37:29.203 --> 37:31.161
Sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt.

37:31.205 --> 37:33.816
Uh, Ben, how are you?
Good to see you again.

37:33.860 --> 37:36.384
The pleasure's mine.

37:36.428 --> 37:38.256
Liam, uh,
Dan came by the house,

37:38.299 --> 37:39.909
and he, uh, well,
he's on his way here.

37:39.953 --> 37:42.738
He wanted to talk to you--
uh, us.

37:44.087 --> 37:45.959
Uh...

37:46.002 --> 37:48.440
Yeah, uh, I'm-I'm so sorry.

37:48.483 --> 37:52.182
Just two seconds. I...

37:54.837 --> 37:58.145
Uh, you know, just saying
a knock might have been helpful.

37:58.188 --> 38:00.452
Well, when you want privacy,
you might want to pick

38:00.495 --> 38:01.888
someplace a little
more intimate

38:01.931 --> 38:03.237
than your brother's bar.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.152
Is this how you treat
your dates?

38:15.771 --> 38:18.383
Dan, what's this about?

38:24.519 --> 38:25.955
Denise threw the race.

38:27.392 --> 38:30.090
She cut the saddle.
You were right, Liam.

38:32.310 --> 38:35.487
Dan, are you saying...I'm just here to help you guys
get your home back.

38:35.530 --> 38:37.358
I'm starting to think

38:37.402 --> 38:38.751
we're the bad guys here,
and I don't want to be

38:38.794 --> 38:40.883
on this side anymore.

39:09.782 --> 39:10.826
You guys okay?

39:10.870 --> 39:13.089
Yeah.

39:13.133 --> 39:15.309
There's, uh, something
we need to talk about.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.442
Well...
Yeah.

39:22.316 --> 39:23.665
Cass,

39:23.709 --> 39:24.971
you might want
to take a seat.

39:29.018 --> 39:31.281
Hey, Cassie.

39:38.767 --> 39:40.334
Miles.
