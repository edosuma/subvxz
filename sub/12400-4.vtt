14:22.403 --> 14:25.145
I'm just sitting here
in a damn hotel suite.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.698
You know,
it won't work forever.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.032
Being on a mission doesn't
make the pain go away.

14:34.165 --> 14:36.451
It just kind of distracts you

14:36.584 --> 14:37.824
from feeling it
for a little while.

14:38.002 --> 14:40.334
I know how to live
with the pain.

14:40.463 --> 14:43.671
| just haven't figured out
what to do with the regret.

14:46.469 --> 14:49.836
Sean died, and all the things
that I never said.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.469
All the misunderstandings
between us, it's like...

14:53.643 --> 14:56.134
I got this empty space
I don't know how to fill.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.261
Thought you had more time.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.400
I tried to tell him.

15:02.485 --> 15:05.648
In the end, |-- But itjust
happened so fast.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.651
I don't think he heard
any of it.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.403
Sean died protecting me,

15:12.537 --> 15:16.655
and I don't think he knew
what he meant to me.

15:18.668 --> 15:21.034
Emily didn't have a clue.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.709
She died for a war
she knew nothing about.

15:26.592 --> 15:30.426
'Cause of a man she knew
even less about.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.473
Last thing she said
was my name.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.687
"Owen . "

15:39.147 --> 15:41.980
And even that was a lie.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.521
That wasn't a lie.

15:48.322 --> 15:50.449
You were Owen.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.403
I think a part of you
still is.

15:59.333 --> 16:02.621
I'm sorry.
I should go check in on them.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.799
Taxi!

16:25.151 --> 16:26.391
( MAN WHISTLES )

16:48.925 --> 16:51.587
Alex: Just give her everything. . ..

16:52.094 --> 16:55.006
Oh, and Sonya, make sure
to scrub the cameras...

16:55.765 --> 16:57.175
Yeah, Sam too.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.647
(GRUNTING)

17:12.949 --> 17:14.780
I seen him before.

17:15.409 --> 17:16.910
Maybe he's some sort of thief,

17:17.078 --> 17:19.740
follows rich people back
from the bank and robs 'em.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.334
This isn't some petty thief.
He works for the Shop.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.962
There's nothing petty
about 20 million dollars.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.586
This is the first Shop member
we've caught alive.

17:33.803 --> 17:36.089
Well, let's find out
what else he knows.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.978
Looks like
they turned off here.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.442
Can you tell where these go?

17:54.156 --> 17:55.987
Nowhere.
Just a lot of trees.

17:56.158 --> 17:58.114
It's an access road,
doesn't go far.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.359
Man: They wouldn't
need to go far.

17:59.453 --> 18:02.195
These trees are enough
to hide from satellites.

18:02.290 --> 18:06.033
Let's ditch the jeep.
They'll hear us coming.

18:09.672 --> 18:11.162
You said an hour.

18:11.299 --> 18:14.416
This is why I don't like
committing to a timetable.

18:22.393 --> 18:25.430
Man: Uploading software...

18:26.897 --> 18:27.556
Now.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.305
Finally.
Start the truck.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.434
The typist can stay in the back
and verify the upload.

18:40.703 --> 18:42.864
Drive, now!

18:46.042 --> 18:47.873
Go! l'll cover you.

19:15.363 --> 19:18.696
Michael, hi.
It's nice to finally meet you.

19:19.033 --> 19:21.991
Nikita thinks you may want a way
out of your deal with the Shop.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.864
I'm here to offer you
that chance.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.528
( LAUGHS ) The Shop?

19:29.126 --> 19:30.241
Look, | get it.

19:30.378 --> 19:31.663
Someone offers you
the chance to walk again.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.088
Who's gonna say "no"
to that?

19:33.964 --> 19:36.091
The cost, the consequences,

19:36.258 --> 19:38.635
it all seems manageable
in comparison. I know.

19:38.761 --> 19:41.673
Yes, I heard about
your miracle hand.

19:41.806 --> 19:44.889
What were the consequences
of that transaction?

19:46.102 --> 19:48.058
Worse than I ever imagined.

Whoever you are,
you don't need to do this.

20:43.492 --> 20:44.993
I know the Shop
made you a slave,

20:45.161 --> 20:46.867
and they turned you
into some-- no!

(GUNSHOT)

20:58.591 --> 21:00.377
(SCREAMS )

21:02.887 --> 21:04.127
You helped me out
in Columbia.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.011
I don't want to
have to kill you.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.846
Now drop it.

21:12.021 --> 21:13.181
No.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.772
You want to offer me the chance
to wreck my deal with the devil.

21:16.859 --> 21:19.350
It was never a fair deal.
You don't have to honor it.

21:19.487 --> 21:22.524
You sure as hell don't
have to die for it.

21:24.408 --> 21:27.366
You really don't get it,
do you?

21:27.870 --> 21:31.704
I don't operate
that way, Michael.

21:32.374 --> 21:34.911
The devil's terms
may be harsh,

21:35.085 --> 21:37.542
but he is always
honest about them.

21:39.548 --> 21:42.085
You knew that hand
came with a price.

21:42.426 --> 21:45.168
You just didn't
want to pay it. ( PANTING )

21:46.055 --> 21:48.046
Fortunately,
you didn't have to.

21:48.182 --> 21:49.547
Just tell me
what they're planning.

21:49.683 --> 21:51.423
Nikita paid it for you.

21:52.102 --> 21:53.888
Yeah, you still have your hand,

21:54.021 --> 21:55.886
but she is the one
being hunted.

21:56.065 --> 21:58.056
Doesn't seem like
a fair deal either.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.390
(GRUNTING)

21:59.443 --> 22:01.354
All right,
this is your last chance.

22:01.445 --> 22:03.231
I'm curious.

22:04.365 --> 22:07.857
How would you ever repay
your debt to Nikita, huh?

22:08.369 --> 22:10.576
What says, "Thank you
for becoming the world's

22:10.704 --> 22:13.912
most notorious assassin
in order to save my life"?

22:14.750 --> 22:16.615
Is there a card?

22:17.753 --> 22:22.167
- I never asked her--
- No, you wouldn't ask.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.794
You'd let her decide.

22:25.594 --> 22:28.631
Always better
at following orders,

22:28.848 --> 22:30.759
rather than giving them.

22:32.101 --> 22:33.341
Shut up, and get in.

22:33.477 --> 22:37.846
You know, they did much more
than simply give me back my legs.

22:38.023 --> 22:40.810
They threw in a bit
of an upgrade.

- Yeah, yeah. I'm good.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.510
I don't think Ramon
wanted out of his deal.

23:20.691 --> 23:23.478
Nikita: Are you seeing this?
Can you ﬁgure out what he did?

23:23.652 --> 23:25.108
He used the onboard computer

23:25.279 --> 23:27.895
as an access point to upload
a really nasty worm.

23:28.073 --> 23:30.189
It's corrupted the entire
missile control system.

23:30.492 --> 23:32.653
So the missile can't be fired.

23:33.245 --> 23:36.282
That doesn't make sense.
Who steals a missile to make it useless?

23:36.498 --> 23:39.035
No, they used the onboard
computer to access

23:39.251 --> 23:42.493
Pakistan's missile controls,
their centralized system.

23:43.213 --> 23:46.501
It's Pakistan's version
of N.O.R.A.D.

23:46.592 --> 23:49.425
So the Shop doesn't
just control one missile now?

23:49.595 --> 23:51.836
They control all of them.

24:08.197 --> 24:10.654
Michael camouflaged the entrance
to the access road,

24:10.783 --> 24:12.774
so the truck is secure for now.

24:12.910 --> 24:14.491
Okay, well, the good news is

24:14.620 --> 24:17.737
the Shop no longer
controls the missile. I do.

24:18.832 --> 24:21.869
The bad news is that they
control everything else?

24:21.961 --> 24:23.542
Yeah, pretty much.

24:23.712 --> 24:24.827
Where are they
controlling this from?

24:24.964 --> 24:26.500
We're not sure.

24:26.632 --> 24:27.712
Is there any way
that we can get Pakistan

24:27.883 --> 24:29.384
to take their
systems offline?

24:29.510 --> 24:31.216
Who could we possibly
call that would listen?

a better idea.

to kill you?

24:47.945 --> 24:49.776

he was operating alone.

he's working for.

see this sooner?

there was one question

your friend never asked me.

25:33.782 --> 25:38.071
How did I get so far into
the room before he caught me?

25:39.079 --> 25:41.070
Was he sleeping?

25:41.957 --> 25:43.993
Or was he watching TV?

25:49.631 --> 25:52.418
I knew you were alone

leaving the hotel.

see that one coming.

26:25.834 --> 26:28.041
And our man in Zurich
hasn't reported in.

26:28.170 --> 26:30.502
We should assume
he's also dead.

26:31.298 --> 26:33.505

three hours away.

- That's not a lot of time.
- But we still have a cruise missile.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.796
We can use that
to take out M.D.K.'s servers.

28:46.016 --> 28:48.177
That would transfer control
back to Pakistan, right?

28:48.352 --> 28:50.843
Yeah, after it blows up my dad.

about the money.

30:58.065 --> 31:01.603
He got his legs, I got my hand,
that was my price.

31:01.902 --> 31:03.563
But I had something he didn't.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.072
- What?
- You.

31:08.283 --> 31:11.366
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't even be here.

31:13.413 --> 31:15.870
I never got to
thank you for that.

31:18.668 --> 31:19.794
(PHONE BEEPS)

31:19.961 --> 31:22.623
That's the signal. You ready?

31:31.181 --> 31:32.387
Baby, your friend's lying.

31:32.599 --> 31:35.011
- Hey.
- Because I wasn't with her.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.967
- Hey, commoner.
- Because she is.

31:37.145 --> 31:38.601
Were there other guys there?

31:38.730 --> 31:39.640
I said, "were there
other guys--"

31:39.815 --> 31:40.895
- Hey.
- What?

31:40.982 --> 31:42.358
- You're trespassing.
- Oh, no, no, no.

31:42.609 --> 31:44.895
- I'm just a guy with a phone.
- ( BEEPING )

31:46.321 --> 31:48.312
(MEN SHOUTING)

31:50.075 --> 31:51.440
Down, down.

31:51.493 --> 31:53.279
- ( GRUNTING )
- All right.

31:53.787 --> 31:56.153
I'm gonna access the mainframe,
pull up the floor plan.

31:56.331 --> 31:57.992
Where are you
not allowed to go?

31:58.083 --> 31:59.664
Floor five.

32:02.295 --> 32:03.831
Yeah, that works too.

32:04.005 --> 32:07.839
Go, go, go.
I'll cover your exit.

32:15.684 --> 32:17.094
Hello, Philip.

32:17.352 --> 32:20.014
Did you have a chance
to think about my offer?

32:21.189 --> 32:23.521
- My God.
- I told you to fold.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.811
And now you're gonna
shut down the missile launch,

32:26.027 --> 32:29.155
'cause we both know that
I didn't kill President Spencer.

32:29.531 --> 32:31.067
But tell me...

32:31.366 --> 32:34.233
...do you know
that I won't kill you?

32:35.829 --> 32:37.865
We 've been compromised.
Stand down.

32:39.332 --> 32:40.458
What?

32:40.584 --> 32:44.076
I say again, desist from your
current course of action.

32:44.379 --> 32:47.041
We've come too far to stop
due to a minor complication.

32:47.215 --> 32:49.376
Oh, is that all I am?

32:49.509 --> 32:51.966
Shut it down.

32:52.721 --> 32:54.507
Shutting down.

32:57.142 --> 33:00.634
- I decide when it's over.
- No, no!

33:00.854 --> 33:04.142
(SCREAMING, GRUNTING)

33:04.983 --> 33:06.484
Where's Amanda?

33:06.735 --> 33:08.566
I got her.
Found the holding cells too.

33:08.695 --> 33:09.935
You take Amanda.
We'll get the cells.

33:10.071 --> 33:12.232
- She's on 7G.
- Got it.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.117
Which cell is it?

33:40.227 --> 33:41.433
Lionel.

33:42.229 --> 33:43.309
Dad.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.393
Huh.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.195
Release everyone else.

34:10.006 --> 34:11.587
Madame President?

34:12.676 --> 34:16.760
Oh, God.
Oh, thank you.

34:20.976 --> 34:22.216
CIA?

34:22.352 --> 34:25.310
- Mmm.
- Marines?

34:27.649 --> 34:29.185
- Division?
- Yeah, it's a long story.

34:29.317 --> 34:30.853
Right now, we need
to get you out of here.

34:38.368 --> 34:41.360
- You have no moves left.
- Neither do you.

34:41.746 --> 34:44.237
M.D.K.'s exposed.
We sent intel packages out

34:44.374 --> 34:47.161
to every intelligence agency
in the world, Amanda.

34:47.586 --> 34:49.872
And how long will
that take to verify?

34:50.046 --> 34:51.297
I'm guessing
longer than it will

34:51.423 --> 34:54.665
for those missiles to take out
the carrier group.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.792
It's not a win
if you can't get away with it.

34:58.013 --> 35:00.004
Everyone will know the truth.

35:10.358 --> 35:14.192
Did you really think it would
end with either of us winning?

35:14.779 --> 35:15.985
Hmm?

35:22.370 --> 35:23.576
Nikita: Amanda!

35:25.707 --> 35:27.789
Abort the launch!
Thousands of people will die.

35:27.876 --> 35:29.787
That's beyond even you.

35:40.305 --> 35:41.670
Helen,

35:43.600 --> 35:45.556
don't let them control you.
You have a choice.

35:45.727 --> 35:48.560
You're not locked in their basements.
They're not testing on you.

35:48.813 --> 35:51.304
You can do
the right thing this time.

35:59.991 --> 36:02.073
It's too late, Nikita.

36:05.955 --> 36:07.695
Helen.

36:12.420 --> 36:14.877
- Birkhoff?
- Yeah, Nikki, I'm here.

36:15.006 --> 36:16.382
- (ALARM BLARING )
- That truck in Pakistan,

36:16.508 --> 36:17.748
do you still have control
of that missile?

36:18.051 --> 36:19.791
Yeah. Wait, why?

36:21.262 --> 36:23.218
I need you to launch it
at M.D.K.

36:23.348 --> 36:25.430
- Right where we 're standing.
- Say that again?

36:25.558 --> 36:27.173
Nikita: Amanda started
the launch sequence.

36:27.602 --> 36:29.388
If we don't knock out
M.D.K.'s systems,

36:29.521 --> 36:30.761
that missile
will launch from Pakistan,

36:30.897 --> 36:32.728
and it'll take out
the carrier groups.

36:32.816 --> 36:34.647
- So we got to move.
- We got to move.

36:34.859 --> 36:37.601
- I'm on it.
- This is really every father's dream.

36:37.779 --> 36:41.943
Watching his son launch a ballistic
missile on his own position.

36:58.216 --> 37:01.299
Missile's on its way.
We got three minutes, tops.

37:05.390 --> 37:06.846
Your missiles will never
see the light of day.

37:06.933 --> 37:09.800
In a few minutes, this place
will be nothing but a crater.

37:11.312 --> 37:12.973
It does not have to end
like this.

37:13.106 --> 37:15.188
Amanda, open the door.
Come with me.

37:15.316 --> 37:17.398
And rot in prison
for the rest of my life?

37:17.569 --> 37:19.230
Won't that be
satisfying for you?

37:19.320 --> 37:22.812
You'll survive. Isn't that
what you are? A survivor?

37:25.326 --> 37:27.738
You don't get to save me, Nikita.

37:28.329 --> 37:30.911
But you will kill me.

37:32.125 --> 37:33.740
What are you doing?

37:36.921 --> 37:39.663
- ( SHOUTING )
- (ALARM BLARING)

37:46.347 --> 37:49.054
(ALARM WAILING )

37:56.608 --> 37:57.848

38:07.452 --> 38:11.240
- ( INDISTINCT CHATTER)
- ( SIRENS WAILING)

38:20.089 --> 38:21.920
Michael: Nikita?

38:30.517 --> 38:32.007
Nikita?

38:35.438 --> 38:36.894
Nikita?

38:41.986 --> 38:43.442
Medic!

38:54.707 --> 38:56.618
Man on TV: We 've received
veriﬁed reports

38:56.751 --> 38:58.207
that Kathleen Spencer is alive.

38:58.253 --> 39:00.710
Let me repeat that, because
I can 't believe it myself.

39:00.755 --> 39:02.461
President Spencer is alive.

39:02.549 --> 39:04.164
Woman: Serious constitutional
crisis. Two presidents.

39:04.259 --> 39:06.295
One in the Oval Ofﬁce,
another whose death was faked.

39:06.386 --> 39:07.751
Man: Rescued by Nikita Mears,

39:07.846 --> 39:10.212
the very same woman accused
of her assassination.

39:10.265 --> 39:12.096
Woman: The chief ﬁnancial
ofﬁcer, Philip Jones,

39:12.141 --> 39:15.975
is presumably held in an
undisclosed CIA black site.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.070
Thank you.

39:35.999 --> 39:39.116
You see,
this is how we do things.

39:39.335 --> 39:40.745
We're not fighters,

39:40.920 --> 39:44.538
we're negotiators,
and we win every time.

39:44.674 --> 39:46.460
Your double was quite good.

39:46.634 --> 39:49.546
Really captured
your biting personality.

39:49.637 --> 39:53.846
Nikita thinks I'm dead.
She thinks she won.

39:54.934 --> 39:56.344
Cheers.

39:56.436 --> 39:59.473
You're toasting the loss
of a $14-billion company?

39:59.981 --> 40:02.848
M.D.K. was but one arm
of our organization.

40:03.151 --> 40:05.187
An arm that had
become infected,

40:05.320 --> 40:08.983
was in danger of exposing
the body, and had to be cut off.

40:09.115 --> 40:11.481
You know a little
something about that.

40:18.499 --> 40:20.490
Hey, hey.

40:23.463 --> 40:24.999
Easy.

40:26.883 --> 40:29.249
Easy. Careful.

40:33.348 --> 40:36.260
- Where are we?
- We're safe.

40:36.392 --> 40:37.928
Jones: A bubble has now
been created

40:38.061 --> 40:39.767
for Nikita to believe in.

40:39.896 --> 40:41.386
She will tell her story,

40:41.522 --> 40:43.729
and make the rest of the world
believe it as well.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.940
As long as they remain
in that bubble,

40:46.069 --> 40:47.980
we'll continue
with business as usual.

40:48.112 --> 40:50.945
Nikita's too smart.
Your illusion won't hold.

40:51.366 --> 40:52.947
Yes, it will.

40:53.368 --> 40:56.110
Because she
so desperately wants it to.

40:56.329 --> 41:00.117
She's longed for the end
of this war for years.

41:15.014 --> 41:16.720
Is it over?

41:28.444 --> 41:30.981
Jones: Even when the truth
stares her in the face,

41:31.114 --> 41:35.107
she'll just close her eyes
and will it away.

41:39.414 --> 41:43.407
After all,
everyone has a price.
