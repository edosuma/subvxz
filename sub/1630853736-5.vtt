02:51.421 --> 02:53.715
was so passionate
about Christianity,

how important it is
in the whole Middle East.

30:22.111 --> 30:23.446
Yeah. Okay.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.740
-MIRIAM: How we are
a light to the nations.
-NATHAN: Yeah.

30:25.823 --> 30:27.951
MIRIAM:
How in Israel was invented

30:28.034 --> 30:30.870
all kinds of medical advances

30:30.954 --> 30:33.623
that help all the people
of all the world,

30:33.706 --> 30:37.210
and some of them don't even know
that they were invented there.

30:37.293 --> 30:38.503
NATHAN: Mm-hmm.

30:38.586 --> 30:42.423
MIRIAM: And then that, uh,
the Intel and the microchips

30:42.507 --> 30:45.260
and the computers
and the medical advances

30:45.343 --> 30:46.553
and all kinds of things,

30:46.636 --> 30:50.056
that we are ohr la'goyim,
a light to the nations.

30:50.139 --> 30:53.226
NATHAN: Yum, these doughnuts
are delicious.

30:53.309 --> 30:56.938
MIRIAM: Oh. In Hebrew,
we call them sufganiyot.

30:57.021 --> 30:58.982
-NATHAN: Sufganiyot, right.
-They're not exactly sufganiyot

30:59.065 --> 31:01.859
because the sufganiyot
are not sugar coated.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.403
These are just jelly doughnuts.
