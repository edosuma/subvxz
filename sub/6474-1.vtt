01:22.487 --> 01:23.636
Success!

01:24.207 --> 01:25.959
Count, it's just you.

01:26.567 --> 01:29.718
I was beginning
to lose faith, Victor.

01:32.087 --> 01:35.238
A pity your moment of triumph
is being spoiled...

01:35.327 --> 01:37.682
over a little thing
like grave robbery.

01:37.767 --> 01:39.041
Yes.

01:39.127 --> 01:41.482
[Pants] I must escape this place.

01:42.127 --> 01:44.516
DRACULA: Where are you going to run,
Victor?

01:45.647 --> 01:50.482
Your peculiar experiments
have made you unwelcome...

01:50.567 --> 01:52.842
in most of the civilized world.

01:52.967 --> 01:56.596
I'll take him away, far away,
where no one will ever find him.

01:56.727 --> 01:58.399
DRACULA: No, no, Victor.

01:58.567 --> 02:01.764
The time has come
for me to take command of him.

02:02.447 --> 02:03.562
What are you saying?

02:03.647 --> 02:06.684
Why do you think I brought you here?
Gave you this castle?

02:06.767 --> 02:09.327
- Equipped your laboratory?
- You said...

02:09.967 --> 02:12.925
- You said you believed in my work.
- And I do.

02:13.647 --> 02:17.959
But now that it is,
as you yourself have said...

02:18.447 --> 02:21.439
a triumph of science...

02:22.367 --> 02:23.959
over God...

02:26.727 --> 02:30.197
it must now serve my purpose.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.966
What purpose?

02:35.807 --> 02:37.445
[Yelling in unison]

02:39.967 --> 02:44.677
[Mob roaring]

02:47.327 --> 02:48.555
Good God!

02:49.247 --> 02:51.681
I would kill myself
before helping in such a task.

02:51.767 --> 02:52.756
[Growls and moans]

02:52.847 --> 02:55.919
Feel free. I don't actually need you
anymore, Victor.

02:56.127 --> 02:57.719
I just need him.

02:58.367 --> 02:59.959
He is the key.

03:00.767 --> 03:03.804
I could never allow him
to be used for such evil.

03:04.287 --> 03:05.515
I could.

03:06.327 --> 03:09.239
In fact,
my brides are insisting upon it.

so kind to me, Doctor...

03:18.207 --> 03:20.357

03:20.567 --> 03:23.001
But he pays me.

03:26.847 --> 03:28.121
VICTOR: Stay back.

03:28.287 --> 03:30.676
You can't kill me, Victor.

09:05.847 --> 09:09.601
You're a big one.
You'll be hard to digest.

09:10.807 --> 09:13.082
I'd hate to be such a nuisance.

09:18.047 --> 09:20.800
[Mr. Hyde growls]

09:20.887 --> 09:22.684
I missed you in London.

09:22.767 --> 09:26.396
No, you bloody did not!
You got me good.

09:26.527 --> 09:29.246
Dr. Jekyll, you're wanted
by the Knights of the Holy Order...

09:29.327 --> 09:30.555
It's Mr. Hyde now.

09:30.807 --> 09:33.401
...for the murder of 12 men,
six women, four...

09:33.487 --> 09:38.163
...children, three goats, and
a rather nasty massacre of poultry!

09:38.807 --> 09:42.322
So you're the great Van Helsing.

09:42.407 --> 09:44.716
And you're a deranged psychopath.

09:49.847 --> 09:52.520
We all have our little problems.

09:54.767 --> 09:57.076
My superiors would like for me
to take you alive...

09:57.167 --> 09:59.635
so that they may extricate
your better half.

09:59.807 --> 10:02.116
[Grunts] I bet they bloody would.

10:02.567 --> 10:05.923
Personally, I'd rather just kill you
and call it a day.

10:06.007 --> 10:08.475
But let's make it your decision,
shall we?

10:08.727 --> 10:09.955
Do let's.

10:30.967 --> 10:33.037
MR. HYDE: Here I come...

10:33.287 --> 10:35.482

11:12.727 --> 11:14.683
I'll bet that's upsetting.

Paris!

11:30.527 --> 11:32.279
Come here.

11:34.407 --> 11:39.037
I think you'll find the view
over here rather spectacular.

13:29.407 --> 13:30.681
Bless me, Father, for I have...

13:30.767 --> 13:33.600
CARDINAL: Sinned. Yes, I know.
You're very good at that.

13:34.327 --> 13:36.238
You shattered the Rose Window.

13:36.327 --> 13:38.966
Not to split hairs, sir,
but Mr. Hyde did the shattering.

13:39.047 --> 13:42.517
13th century. Over 600 years old.

13:43.887 --> 13:47.243
- I wish you a week in hell for that.
- It would be a nice reprieve.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.603
Don't get me wrong.
Your results are unquestionable...

13:50.767 --> 13:53.725
but your methods
attract far too much attention.

13:54.007 --> 13:56.601
"Wanted" posters?
We are not pleased.

13:56.687 --> 13:59.281
Do you think I like being
the most wanted man in Europe?

13:59.367 --> 14:01.597
Why don't you and the Order
do something about it?

14:01.687 --> 14:03.723
Because we do not exist.

14:04.047 --> 14:05.958
Well, then neither do I.

14:09.287 --> 14:13.041
CARDINAL: When we found you crawling up
the steps of this church, half-dead...

14:13.127 --> 14:16.642
it was clear to all of us that
you had been sent to do God's work.

14:16.727 --> 14:19.195
- Why can't he do it himself?
- Don't blaspheme.

14:19.287 --> 14:22.757
You already lost your memory
as a penance for past sins.

14:23.487 --> 14:25.159
CARDINAL: If you wish to recover it...

14:25.247 --> 14:28.000
I suggest you continue
to heed the call.

14:29.647 --> 14:32.366
Without us,
the world would be in darkness.

14:32.527 --> 14:35.519
Governments and empires
come and go...

14:35.607 --> 14:39.964
but we have kept mankind safe
since time immemorial.

14:40.367 --> 14:42.756
CARDINAL: We are the last defense
against evil.

14:42.887 --> 14:46.163
CARDINAL: An evil that the rest of mankind
has no idea even exists.

14:46.247 --> 14:50.638
To you, these monsters are
just evil beings to be vanquished.

14:52.247 --> 14:54.283
I'm the one standing there
when they die...

14:54.367 --> 14:56.085
and become the men they once were.

14:56.167 --> 14:59.523
For you, my good son,
this is all a test of faith.

14:59.967 --> 15:03.357
And now,
we need you to go to the East.

15:03.967 --> 15:06.401
To the far side of Romania.

15:07.247 --> 15:08.726
An accursed land...

15:08.807 --> 15:11.640
terrorized by all sorts
of nightmarish creatures.

15:11.847 --> 15:14.964
CARDINAL: Lorded over
by a certain Count Dracula.

15:15.527 --> 15:17.518
VAN HELSING: Dracula?
CARDINAL: Yes.

15:17.927 --> 15:20.521
You've never faced one
like this before.

15:21.447 --> 15:24.723
Our story begins 450 years ago...

15:24.807 --> 15:28.197
when a Transylvanian knight
named Valerious the Elder...

15:28.447 --> 15:31.837
promised God that his family
would never rest nor enter heaven...

15:31.927 --> 15:34.805
until they vanquished Dracula
from their land.

15:35.327 --> 15:37.204
They have not succeeded...

15:37.807 --> 15:40.241
and they are running out of family.

15:41.127 --> 15:45.200
CARDINAL: His descendant Boris Valerious,
King of the Gypsies.

15:45.407 --> 15:47.841
He disappeared almost 12 months ago.

15:49.327 --> 15:54.003
CARDINAL: His only son, Prince Velkan,
and his daughter, Princess Anna.

15:54.327 --> 15:57.478
CARDINAL: If the two of them are killed
before Dracula is vanquished...

15:57.567 --> 15:59.603
nine generations of their family...

15:59.687 --> 16:02.201
will never enter
the gates of St. Peter.

16:02.807 --> 16:04.559
For more than four centuries...

16:04.647 --> 16:07.241
this family has defended
our left flank.

16:07.327 --> 16:09.124
They gave their lives.

16:09.847 --> 16:12.407
We cannot let them
slip into purgatory.

16:12.487 --> 16:14.682
So you're sending me into hell.

16:16.687 --> 16:18.006
In a manner.

16:20.967 --> 16:24.482
Valerious the Elder left this here
400 years ago.

16:25.207 --> 16:26.959
We don't know its purpose...

16:27.047 --> 16:29.515
but he would not have
left it lightly.

16:29.607 --> 16:32.075
The Latin inscription translates as:

16:32.727 --> 16:35.287
"In the name of God,
open this door."

16:36.287 --> 16:38.005
There is an insignia.

16:41.967 --> 16:44.356
Yes, it matches your ring.

16:45.367 --> 16:49.485
I think that in Transylvania
you may find the answer you seek.

17:02.727 --> 17:03.716
Getting there.

17:03.807 --> 17:05.559
- Carl!
- There you are.

17:06.007 --> 17:08.760
Did you bring Mr. Hyde back,
or did you kill him?

17:08.847 --> 17:11.599
You killed him, didn't you?
That's why they get so annoyed.

17:11.686 --> 17:14.838
When they ask you to bring someone
back, they don't mean as a corpse.

17:14.926 --> 17:16.679
CARL: All right, you're in a mood.
Come on.

17:16.767 --> 17:19.327
I have some things that'll
put the bit back in your mouth.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.443
Any idiot can make a sword.

17:22.047 --> 17:23.320
Sorry, Father.

17:23.406 --> 17:25.875
VAN HELSING: Come along, Carl.
CARL: Here, take this:

17:26.527 --> 17:29.917
Rings of garlic, holy water...

17:32.127 --> 17:35.085
silver stake, crucifix.

17:37.887 --> 17:39.957
Why can't I have one of those?

17:40.047 --> 17:42.481
You've never gone after vampires
before now, have you?

17:42.607 --> 17:44.837
Vampires, gargoyles, warlocks,
they're all the same.

17:44.927 --> 17:46.201
VAN HELSING: Best when cooked well.

17:46.287 --> 17:47.356
No, they're not all the same.

17:47.447 --> 17:50.757
A vampire is nothing like a warlock.
My granny could kill a warlock.

17:50.847 --> 17:52.838
Carl, you've never even been
out of the abbey.

17:52.927 --> 17:55.566
- How do you know about vampires?
- I read.

17:56.567 --> 17:58.319
Here's something new.

17:58.767 --> 18:00.723

is wrong with you?

18:10.287 --> 18:12.721
The air around here
is thick with envy.

18:13.167 --> 18:16.477
This is my latest invention.
It's gas-propelled.

18:16.567 --> 18:18.842
Capable of catapulting arrows
in rapid succession...

18:18.927 --> 18:22.397
at tremendous velocity.
Just pull the trigger and hold on.

18:23.127 --> 18:25.118
I've heard the stories
from Transylvania.

18:25.207 --> 18:28.085
Trust me, you'll need this.
A work of certifiable genius.

18:28.167 --> 18:31.159
- lf you don't say so yourself.
- No, I did say so myself.

18:31.247 --> 18:33.044

I've been working on that

I don't know,
but I'm sure it'll come in handy.

Twelve years,
and you don't know what it does?

18:47.367 --> 18:49.835
I didn't say that.
I said I didn't know what it's for.

18:49.927 --> 18:52.202
What it does
is to create a light source...

18:52.287 --> 18:53.800
equal to the intensity of the sun.

You shouldn't curse at all.

I can curse all I want...

Why is it so important
to kill this Dracula, anyway?

23:41.727 --> 23:44.605
- Because he's the son of the Devil.
- I mean, besides that.

If we kill him, anything bitten

what have you learned?

That Count Dracula was actually
the son of Valerious the Elder.

And in 1462, when Dracula died...

01:28:20.207 --> 01:28:23.324
- he made a covenant with the Devil.
- And was given a new life.

01:28:23.407 --> 01:28:26.319
But the only way he could sustain
that life was by drinking blood.

having sired this evil creature...

went to Rome to seek forgiveness.
That's when the bargain was made.

As evil as Dracula was, my ancestor
couldn't kill his own son.

So he banished him
to an icy fortress...

kill his son, he left clues.

01:39:52.527 --> 01:39:55.917
Then maybe I need
to try a little harder.

01:39:58.167 --> 01:39:59.156
[Giggles]

01:40:01.047 --> 01:40:02.605
[Shrieks in pain]

01:40:03.047 --> 01:40:05.515
Viscous material!
What did I tell you?

01:40:05.687 --> 01:40:07.245
Get it!

01:40:15.767 --> 01:40:17.837
Hot.

01:40:17.927 --> 01:40:18.916
- Come on!
- Yes.

01:40:19.007 --> 01:40:22.363
We've got to get the antidote
to Van Helsing! Go!

01:40:25.327 --> 01:40:27.079
You can't go until I say you can go!

01:40:27.167 --> 01:40:28.680
Keep running, Carl!

01:40:29.847 --> 01:40:32.566
And I'll say you can go
when you're dead!

01:40:33.967 --> 01:40:37.403
[Suspenseful instrumental music]

01:40:46.447 --> 01:40:47.436

CARL: Oh, my God!

01:41:44.567 --> 01:41:48.082
What are you doing?
You must find the cure!

01:41:48.167 --> 01:41:50.806
- My friends are doing it for me.
- Friends.

01:41:50.887 --> 01:41:52.525
Yes. You want one?

01:41:52.607 --> 01:41:55.121
I can't unscrew the bolts.
This is gonna hurt.

01:41:55.207 --> 01:41:57.004
I am accustomed to pain.

01:41:57.087 --> 01:41:58.805
It lets you know you're alive.

01:41:58.887 --> 01:42:01.162
[Howls in pain]

01:42:06.007 --> 01:42:09.363
[lntense instrumental music continues]

01:42:16.047 --> 01:42:18.117
Give me life!

01:42:32.807 --> 01:42:36.402
One more bolt
and my young will live.

01:42:49.367 --> 01:42:51.483

01:43:42.847 --> 01:43:47.602

[Aleera cackles]

01:45:03.607 --> 01:45:05.040
Help me!

01:45:05.567 --> 01:45:07.603
But you're supposed to die.

01:45:08.247 --> 01:45:10.397
I want to live.

01:45:13.207 --> 01:45:14.526
All right!

01:45:19.647 --> 01:45:21.763
Be happy in the knowledge...

01:45:21.847 --> 01:45:25.635
that I shall weep
over your dead body.

01:45:29.647 --> 01:45:31.763
Hang on!

01:45:32.567 --> 01:45:34.797

You are too late, my friend.

01:46:10.647 --> 01:46:12.444
My children live.

01:46:13.127 --> 01:46:16.278
Then the only way to kill them
is to kill you.

01:46:16.647 --> 01:46:17.841
Correct.

01:46:20.367 --> 01:46:21.641
So be it.

01:46:22.247 --> 01:46:23.236
[Clock chiming]

01:46:25.727 --> 01:46:26.762
One.

01:46:33.727 --> 01:46:35.922
No, this cannot be.

01:46:45.287 --> 01:46:46.720
[Laughs sinisterly]

01:46:48.607 --> 01:46:51.679
We are both part of
the same grand game, Gabriel.

01:46:52.127 --> 01:46:55.836
But we need not find ourselves
on opposite sides of the board.

01:47:04.567 --> 01:47:06.956
[lntense instrumental music]

01:47:36.887 --> 01:47:38.843

01:47:49.127 --> 01:47:50.401
Now!

01:47:51.687 --> 01:47:53.006
Thank you.

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

01:48:18.527 --> 01:48:22.839
Oh, my God!
Anna, I need a little help!

01:48:26.727 --> 01:48:27.842
Hurry!

01:48:38.007 --> 01:48:40.077
ANNA: Throw it to me, Carl!

01:48:46.647 --> 01:48:47.636
Yes!

01:49:07.927 --> 01:49:11.158
You are being used, Gabriel,
as was I.

01:49:11.687 --> 01:49:14.247
But I escaped. So can you.

01:49:55.367 --> 01:49:56.959
ALEERA: Anna, my love...

01:49:57.247 --> 01:50:00.717
it is your blood
that shall keep me beautiful.

01:50:01.407 --> 01:50:03.398
What do you think of that?

01:50:06.287 --> 01:50:07.356
[Screaming in sudden pain]

01:50:07.447 --> 01:50:10.086
I think if you're going to
kill someone, kill them.

01:50:10.167 --> 01:50:12.237
Don't stand there talking about it.

01:50:14.207 --> 01:50:17.244

01:50:35.607 --> 01:50:37.165
Don't you understand?

01:50:37.247 --> 01:50:41.001
We could be friends. Partners!

01:50:42.407 --> 01:50:43.999
Brothers-in-arms!

01:51:13.287 --> 01:51:17.565
Did I mention that it was you
who murdered me?

01:51:18.047 --> 01:51:21.676
It must be such a burden.
Such a curse...

01:51:22.607 --> 01:51:24.996
to be the Left Hand of God.

01:51:27.607 --> 01:51:30.246
All I want is life, Gabriel.

01:51:30.807 --> 01:51:32.843
The continuation of my kind.

01:51:33.647 --> 01:51:37.276
And perhaps the return of my ring.

01:51:41.247 --> 01:51:44.045
Don't be afraid, Gabriel.
Don't be afraid.

01:51:45.527 --> 01:51:49.918
I shall give you back your life,
your memory.

01:51:51.207 --> 01:51:53.402
Some things
are better left forgotten.

[Dramatic instrumental music continues]

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

01:52:35.487 --> 01:52:36.966
God forgive me.
