I'LL TAKE HIM OUT.

12:44.709 --> 12:45.625
- NO.

12:45.625 --> 12:47.041
I WANT TO TALK TO HIM.

12:47.041 --> 12:48.375
- TALK?

12:48.375 --> 12:49.917
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO
IN THE MEANTIME?

12:49.917 --> 12:52.792
WE GOT TWO BOATS WAITING
TO DROP OFF OUR SUPPLY,

12:52.792 --> 12:56.208
EVEN THOUGH WE CAN'T MOVE
WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE.

12:56.208 --> 13:00.208
WE ARE BLEEDING MONEY.

13:06.750 --> 13:10.208
- THE BARTENDER, ALEX.
ONE OF OURS, ISN'T HE?

13:12.583 --> 13:14.750
- YEAH.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.667
- SO LET'S GIVE THEM
WHAT THEY WANT.

13:21.542 --> 13:22.709
- FOR MY MONEY,

13:22.709 --> 13:27.000
FOUR ON ONE IS NOT
REALLY A FAIR FIGHT.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.750
I DID A LITTLE BOXING MYSELF
BACK IN THE DAY.

13:28.750 --> 13:30.750
I DIDN'T TAKE ON FOUR COPS,

13:30.750 --> 13:33.125
BUT I, YOU KNOW--
I HELD MY OWN.

13:33.125 --> 13:34.583
- [sighs]

13:34.583 --> 13:38.458
- YOU DON'T WANT TO CHITCHAT.
I GET THAT.

13:38.458 --> 13:40.333
HERE'S THE THING THOUGH.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.667
MY LIEUTENANT
IS GONNA COME IN HERE

13:42.667 --> 13:45.333
AND SAY THAT SHE SAW YOU
AT THE MAZE

13:45.333 --> 13:48.375
WHERE THAT WAITRESS DIED.

13:48.375 --> 13:49.625
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

13:49.625 --> 13:52.291
- RIGHT. GUY LIKE YOU
WAS PROBABLY AT THE GYM.

13:52.291 --> 13:54.458
BUT SHE'S A WOMAN.

13:54.458 --> 13:57.834
THEY GET SHIT WRONG
ALL THE TIME.

13:57.834 --> 14:01.667
AND THIS ONE, MAN,
SHE'S MY BOSS.

14:01.667 --> 14:03.500
IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.417
I HAVE TO FUCKING ANSWER

14:05.417 --> 14:07.959
TO HER SKINNY ASS
EVERY DAY.

14:07.959 --> 14:10.959
AND SHE'S ALWAYS SQUAWKING
AT ME, YOU KNOW.

14:10.959 --> 14:12.709
HER BEAK GOES
"SQUAWK, SQUAWK,

14:12.709 --> 14:15.250
SQUAWK, SQUAWK, SQUAWK,
SQUAWK, SQUAWK."

14:15.250 --> 14:17.792
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I ENVY YOU.

14:17.792 --> 14:20.208
I'VE BEEN WANTING
TO POP MY LIEUTENANT

14:20.208 --> 14:21.792
IN THAT BEAK OF HERS
FOR YEARS.

14:21.792 --> 14:24.667
[laughs]

14:24.667 --> 14:28.250
SHE'S DYING
TO GET A SHOT AT YOU.

14:28.250 --> 14:32.083
SHOULD WE LET HER?
COULD BE FUN.

14:32.083 --> 14:34.959
RIGHT?

14:36.375 --> 14:38.500
ALL RIGHT.

14:45.500 --> 14:46.458
- NICE JOB IN THERE.

14:46.458 --> 14:48.208
- HE'S ALL READY FOR YOU.

14:48.208 --> 14:49.583
- DEB.

14:49.583 --> 14:51.375
GOOD LUCK.

14:54.041 --> 14:57.208
HE WAS MINE, BUT DEB NEEDS THIS
MORE THAN ME.

14:57.208 --> 14:59.542
AND SHE NEEDS TO GET HIM
HER WAY.

14:59.542 --> 15:01.542
- REMEMBER ME?

15:01.542 --> 15:03.375
I SAW YOU JUST
THE OTHER NIGHT.

15:03.375 --> 15:06.583
THAT IS SOME MAZE
THAT YOU BUILT.

15:06.583 --> 15:10.291
WHAT IS IT FOR, RAY?

15:10.291 --> 15:12.750
ARE YOU SURE
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME?

15:15.667 --> 15:19.458
MAYBE I'M NOT PRETTY ENOUGH.

15:19.458 --> 15:22.291
YOUR MOM SURE WAS PRETTY.

15:22.291 --> 15:24.792
SHE DIED
A FEW YEARS AGO, RIGHT?

15:24.792 --> 15:29.333
CAST A LONG SHADOW,
I BET.

15:29.333 --> 15:30.792
HARD FOR ANY GIRL
TO MEASURE UP TO THOSE LOOKS,

15:30.792 --> 15:34.375
BUT YOU KEEP TRYING,
DON'T YOU?

15:34.375 --> 15:37.875
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
THE GIRLS THAT GO HOME WITH YOU?

15:37.875 --> 15:39.250
THAT THEY'RE STUPID?

15:39.250 --> 15:41.417
EASY?

15:41.417 --> 15:44.583
THAT THEY'RE WHORES?

15:44.583 --> 15:46.583
THEY'D HAVE TO BE, RIGHT?

15:46.583 --> 15:48.583
TO GO HOME WITH YOU,

15:48.583 --> 15:51.583
TAKE THEIR CLOTHES
OFF FOR YOU.

15:51.583 --> 15:53.750
GIRLS LIKE THAT ARE VULGAR.

15:53.750 --> 15:58.583
BUT GIRLS LIKE THAT,
SURE DO LOOK LIKE YOUR MOM.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.542
SO I HAVE TO WONDER...

16:00.542 --> 16:02.542
YOUR MOM WAS SO PRETTY.

16:02.542 --> 16:04.834
SHE PROBABLY HAD
A LOT OF ADMIRERS, RIGHT?

16:04.834 --> 16:06.125
MEN WHO WOULD GO HOME
WITH HER

16:06.125 --> 16:10.667
AND WATCH HER
TAKE HER CLOTHES OFF.

16:10.667 --> 16:13.667
AND THEN TAKE HER ANY WAY
THAT THEY WANTED HER?

16:13.667 --> 16:16.083
- SHUT UP.

16:16.083 --> 16:21.125
- THERE WERE MANY WAYS
TO BREAK A BODY DOWN.

16:21.125 --> 16:24.750
- YOU COULD HEAR IT,
COULDN'T YOU?

16:24.750 --> 16:26.834
YOU COULD HEAR HER THROUGH
THOSE THIN WALLS

16:26.834 --> 16:29.125
THAT THE TWO OF YOU
SHARED.

16:29.125 --> 16:32.625
YOU COULD HEAR HOW MUCH
SHE LOVED GETTING FUCKED

16:32.625 --> 16:34.083
BY ALL THOSE MEN.

16:34.083 --> 16:36.083
YOU COULD HEAR
HER KISSING THEM,

16:36.083 --> 16:39.000
ALL THE THINGS THAT
SHE MIGHT DO WITH HER MOUTH,

16:39.000 --> 16:41.625
THAT SAME MOUTH
SHE WOULD KISS YOU WITH.

16:41.625 --> 16:45.375
BUT BE HONEST, RAY.

16:45.375 --> 16:49.500
YOU KIND OF LIKED IT,
DIDN'T YOU?

16:49.500 --> 16:51.625
WEREN'T YOU KIND OF WISHING

16:51.625 --> 16:53.458
THAT IT WAS YOU INSIDE HER?

16:53.458 --> 16:54.834
[clatter]

16:54.834 --> 16:56.959
- I SHOULD'VE KILLED YOU LIKE
I KILLED THAT OTHER BITCH!

16:56.959 --> 16:58.667
- GO TO HELL.

16:58.667 --> 17:02.125
- WE GOT HIM.

17:08.667 --> 17:10.667
- WAY TO GO, LIEUTENANT.

17:10.667 --> 17:13.208
- ALL RIGHT.
- GOOD JOB.

17:14.834 --> 17:17.208
- HEY, DEB.

17:17.208 --> 17:18.208
JAMIE SAID SHE WAS GOOD

17:18.208 --> 17:20.000
TO WATCH HARRISON
TILL LATE TONIGHT

17:20.000 --> 17:23.250
IF YOU WANT
TO GRAB A DRINK OR SOMETHING.

17:24.500 --> 17:29.667
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE
IN THE MOOD TO CELEBRATE.

17:29.667 --> 17:31.291
- I'M REALLY GLAD
WE GOT SPELTZER.

17:31.291 --> 17:33.291
BUT CELEBRATE?
NO.

17:33.291 --> 17:36.792
MELANIE GARRETT IS STILL DEAD.

17:36.792 --> 17:38.709
- BUT YOU GOT SPELTZER.

17:38.709 --> 17:40.125
HE'LL NEVER HURT ANYONE AGAIN.

17:40.125 --> 17:41.583
WELL, OUTSIDE OF PRISON.

17:41.583 --> 17:45.417
- DEXTER.

17:45.417 --> 17:47.750
I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT
ABOUT RITA--

17:47.750 --> 17:49.750
ABOUT HOW SHE DIED.

17:49.750 --> 17:52.709
SHE DIED BECAUSE OF YOU.

17:52.709 --> 17:55.542
BECAUSE YOU WERE SELFISH.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.458
YOU HAVE A SON.

17:57.458 --> 17:59.250
HARRISON IS THREE YEARS OLD.

17:59.250 --> 18:00.583
SOMEONE NEEDS TO PROTECT HIM.

18:00.583 --> 18:01.875
- I DO.

18:01.875 --> 18:06.750
- SOMEONE NEEDS
TO PROTECT HIM FROM YOU.

18:06.750 --> 18:09.125
HE COULD GO LIVE
WITH ASTOR AND CODY,

18:09.125 --> 18:11.208
WITH THEIR GRANDPARENTS
IN ORLANDO.

18:11.208 --> 18:13.834
- I AM A GOOD FATHER.
I AM THE RIGHT PERSON--

18:13.834 --> 18:18.792
THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN
AND SHOULD RAISE MY SON.

18:18.792 --> 18:20.291
WHO, LIKE ME,
LOST HIS MOTHER.

18:20.291 --> 18:22.250
- IT IS NOT FAIR OF YOU

18:22.250 --> 18:26.041
TO EXPOSE A CHILD
TO YOUR LIFE...

18:26.041 --> 18:29.166
CHOICES.

18:29.166 --> 18:32.625
YOU HAVE TO DECIDE!
YOUR DESIRES OR--

18:32.625 --> 18:33.542
- NO, I DON'T.

18:33.542 --> 18:34.750
- YOU SAID IT YOURSELF,
DEXTER,

18:34.750 --> 18:35.875
THAT YOU CAN'T STOP,

18:35.875 --> 18:37.750
THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO STOP.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.917
AND IF YOU KEEP DOING THIS,

18:39.917 --> 18:42.917
YOU'RE LIKE
A FUCKING MAGNET.

18:42.917 --> 18:47.125
BAD SHIT IS GONNA FIND YOU.

18:47.125 --> 18:48.959
- AND IF THAT HAPPENS,
I'LL HANDLE IT.

18:48.959 --> 18:50.083
- [scoffs]

18:52.709 --> 18:55.959
WHAT IF YOU HAD BEEN
THREE MINUTES LATER

18:55.959 --> 18:57.834
TO SPELTZER'S FUCKING MAZE?

18:57.834 --> 18:58.917
- BUT I WASN'T.

18:58.917 --> 19:03.625
- YOU WERE TOO LATE FOR RITA.

19:03.625 --> 19:06.875
- I SHOULD HAVE KILLED TRINITY
THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM.

19:06.875 --> 19:07.959
THAT'S THE MISTAKE I MADE.

19:07.959 --> 19:09.125
- THAT'S THE MISTAKE
THAT YOU MADE?

19:09.125 --> 19:10.166
- YES!

19:10.166 --> 19:11.875
AND I WILL NEVER,
FROM THIS MOMENT ON--

19:11.875 --> 19:13.250
DO YOU HEAR ME?

19:13.250 --> 19:15.291
I WILL NEVER EVER
MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN.

19:15.291 --> 19:17.542
- IT IS NOT IN YOUR CONTROL.

19:17.542 --> 19:21.458
- EVERYTHING IS
IN MY CONTROL.

19:25.583 --> 19:27.625
[exhales]

19:31.917 --> 19:33.375
I AM NOT GIVING UP MY SON.

19:39.208 --> 19:41.166
[engine turns over]

19:53.500 --> 19:54.583
- MR. SIRKO.

19:54.583 --> 19:56.667
GEORGE.

19:56.667 --> 19:57.834
I WASN'T EXPECTING VISITORS.

19:57.834 --> 19:59.083
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

19:59.083 --> 20:00.500
WE DON'T STAND
ON CEREMONY HERE.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.000
- HAVE A SEAT, ALEX.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.709
- YOU HAVE
A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY.

20:03.709 --> 20:04.875
[door closes]

20:04.875 --> 20:06.208
- THANK YOU.

20:06.208 --> 20:07.417
- THAT IS WHY I CAME HERE.

20:07.417 --> 20:11.083
THEY ARE STILL IN KURSK.

20:11.083 --> 20:13.667
- YOUR SON AND DAUGHTER,
WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES?

20:13.667 --> 20:18.834
- MY SON'S ZAKHARY AND MY GIRL,
HER NAME'S YULIA.

20:18.834 --> 20:20.834
- THEY'RE TWINS, YES?
HOW OLD?

20:20.834 --> 20:23.542
- FIVE.
THEIR BIRTHDAY'S IN APRIL.

20:23.542 --> 20:25.041
- WOW, FIVE.

20:25.041 --> 20:27.750
THAT'S THE BEST AGE, HUH?

20:27.750 --> 20:31.875
LEARNING TO READ, WALKING,
SEEING THE WORLD,

20:31.875 --> 20:34.333
AND YET, THEY STILL WANT
TO BE HELD.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.625
YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHY
I STOPPED BY.

20:36.625 --> 20:39.000
WELL, YOU SEE--

20:39.000 --> 20:40.375
TELL ME...

20:40.375 --> 20:43.000
HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU SEND BACK
TO KURSK EACH MONTH?

20:43.000 --> 20:44.875
FROM YOUR JOB
AT THE FOX HOLE?

20:44.875 --> 20:47.667
- $750.

20:47.667 --> 20:50.875
I TAKE OUT ONLY MY RENT,
MY FOOD,

20:50.875 --> 20:52.709
SOME MONEY FOR MY CAR.

20:52.709 --> 20:54.750
- A SACRIFICE FOR YOU,
I'M SURE.

20:54.750 --> 20:56.250
YEAH, BUT STILL,

20:56.250 --> 20:58.750
IT'S NOT VERY MUCH.

20:58.750 --> 21:03.750
WHAT IF YOUR FAMILY COULD HAVE
A LOT OF MONEY?

21:03.750 --> 21:05.875
SECURITY.

21:05.875 --> 21:08.709
AND COLLEGE
FOR ZAKHARY AND YULIA?

21:08.709 --> 21:10.542
YOU'D WANT THAT FOR THEM.

21:10.542 --> 21:13.917
- I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING
FOR THEM.

21:13.917 --> 21:15.250
- THAT PLEASES ME.

21:15.250 --> 21:19.667
BECAUSE THAT IS WHY
I CAME BY HERE TODAY.

21:19.667 --> 21:21.709
TO ASK YOU A FAVOR, ALEX.

21:21.709 --> 21:23.375
- YES, OF COURSE.
ANYTHING.

21:23.375 --> 21:26.166
- I HAVE A PROBLEM.

21:26.166 --> 21:29.375
ONE OF MY MEN KILLED
A POLICE OFFICER,

21:29.375 --> 21:31.792
AND I HAVE
TO GIVE THE POLICE A SUSPECT

21:31.792 --> 21:33.250
SO THEY'LL STOP HARASSING US.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.959
AND THAT SUSPECT IS YOU.

21:34.959 --> 21:39.291
- BUT I DIDN'T KILL ANYONE.

21:39.291 --> 21:40.792
- SURE, YOU DID.

21:40.792 --> 21:43.125
- I WANT YOU TO WRITE A NOTE.

21:43.125 --> 21:45.291
PEN, PAPER?

21:47.125 --> 21:51.542
THIS IS WHAT
I WANT YOU TO WRITE.

21:51.542 --> 21:53.959
"KAJA.

21:53.959 --> 21:58.959
"I CANNOT LIVE
WITH WHAT I HAVE DONE.

21:58.959 --> 22:01.417
I'M VERY SORRY."

22:03.667 --> 22:06.834
I WILL TAKE CARE
OF YOUR FAMILY NOW.

22:06.834 --> 22:11.500
ZAKHARY AND YULIA
WILL WANT FOR NOTHING.

22:13.709 --> 22:16.000
- [gasps]
- THAT'S FOR YOU.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.542
IT'S THE GUN THAT KILLED
THE POLICE OFFICER.

22:17.542 --> 22:22.208
- WHAT DO I DO WITH IT?

22:22.208 --> 22:25.333
- BANG.

22:28.250 --> 22:30.500
- LOOK AT YOUR
CHILDREN'S FACES.

22:30.500 --> 22:32.834
THEY'RE LOOKING AT YOU.

22:32.834 --> 22:35.000
WANTING YOU TO GIVE THEM
THE BEST LIFE

22:35.000 --> 22:36.625
THIS WORLD HAS TO OFFER.

22:36.625 --> 22:40.166
YOU WILL DO THIS FOR THEM.

22:40.166 --> 22:43.750
- AND IF I DON'T?

22:43.750 --> 22:45.333
- WE'LL KILL YOU ANYWAY.

22:45.333 --> 22:50.458
AND THROW YOUR WIFE
AND FUCKING KIDS IN THE RIVER.

22:50.458 --> 22:51.750
- NO NEED FOR THREATS.

22:51.750 --> 22:53.792
- WE'RE ALL FRIENDS HERE.

22:53.792 --> 22:59.166
BUT I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND
THE SITUATION.

23:04.208 --> 23:06.500
[speaking Russian]

23:15.500 --> 23:16.625
[glass clinks]

23:16.625 --> 23:18.375
YOU WON'T FEEL A THING.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.792
IT'LL BE QUICK,

23:23.792 --> 23:26.000
LIKE TURNING OFF A LIGHT.

23:42.500 --> 23:44.417
- [panicked breathing]

23:46.750 --> 23:49.417
[voice shaking]
FOR MY FAMILY?

23:54.667 --> 23:57.542
[gunshot and thud]

24:04.458 --> 24:06.750
- HANNAH MCKAY.

24:06.750 --> 24:08.417
SHE SPENT SIX YEARS IN JUVIE

24:08.417 --> 24:11.125
AFTER PLEADING GUILTY TO BEING
WAYNE RANDALL'S ACCOMPLICE.

24:11.125 --> 24:15.083
SHE ALWAYS CLAIMED SHE WAS JUST
ANOTHER ONE OF HIS VICTIMS.

24:15.083 --> 24:18.625
WAYNE CALLED HER THE ROBIN
TO HIS BATMAN,

24:18.625 --> 24:20.542
BUT WITH BETTER LEGS.

24:20.542 --> 24:23.917
- DEXTER MORGAN.

24:23.917 --> 24:25.333
- YOU LOOK A LITTLE LOST.

24:25.333 --> 24:27.959
- WELL, I HAVEN'T BEEN INSIDE
A POLICE STATION

24:27.959 --> 24:29.250
IN 15 YEARS.

24:29.250 --> 24:31.417
STILL SMELLS THE SAME,

24:31.417 --> 24:33.792

EXACTLY OUR MAIN CONCERN.

DEPARTMENT FOUND THE BODY

24:40.208 --> 24:41.625
OF ONE OF WAYNE'S VICTIMS.

24:41.625 --> 24:43.250
- YEAH, THEY WENT BACK
ONE LAST TIME

24:43.250 --> 24:46.291
AFTER WAYNE...DIED.

24:46.291 --> 24:50.250
AND EXPANDED THE PERIMETER.

24:50.250 --> 24:51.458
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE DOING HERE?

24:51.458 --> 24:54.625

THE OTHER BODIES WAYNE BURIED?

24:54.625 --> 24:58.458

IT WAS FOR THE BEST.

24:59.625 --> 25:01.500
THERE'S A RUMOR
GOING AROUND

25:01.500 --> 25:04.083
THAT YOU WERE THE LAST PERSON
TO TALK TO WAYNE

25:04.083 --> 25:07.834
BEFORE HE...

25:07.834 --> 25:11.000
DIED.

WERE ABOUT YOU.

25:12.917 --> 25:16.208
- OH.

25:16.208 --> 25:17.667

25:17.667 --> 25:20.667
EVERY DAY BEING LIKE
AN UNWRAPPED PRESENT.

25:20.667 --> 25:23.667

25:23.667 --> 25:28.458

THAT FORTUNE FROM A COOKIE.

25:28.458 --> 25:32.500

STAY IN CONTACT?

25:32.500 --> 25:35.250

25:37.458 --> 25:39.834

GOING ANYWAY?

25:39.834 --> 25:41.166

25:41.166 --> 25:43.750
- NOT MUCH OF ONE AT FIRST.

25:43.750 --> 25:46.250
WE WERE JUST TRYING TO GET OUT
OF CLOPTON, ALABAMA,

25:46.250 --> 25:47.709
WHICH ISN'T EVEN A TOWN.

25:47.709 --> 25:49.959

AND A CEMETERY.

25:49.959 --> 25:52.667
BUT SOMEWHERE AROUND SARASOTA,

25:52.667 --> 25:54.417

25:54.417 --> 25:56.625

27:36.125 --> 27:38.625

HIS RIGHTS.

27:42.792 --> 27:43.667

27:43.667 --> 27:44.709

FUCKING NODDED.

THIS MORNING,

27:48.792 --> 27:50.500

TO MAKE THE CASE--

27:50.500 --> 27:51.583
- DON'T.

27:51.583 --> 27:52.667
- THAT BECAUSE SPELTZER

27:52.667 --> 27:53.750
AT ONE POINT KNOCKED
UNCONSCIOUS,

27:53.750 --> 27:55.250
IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE

27:55.250 --> 27:57.375
THAT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
HIS RIGHTS,

27:57.375 --> 27:59.834
THAT IT WASN'T A NOD, THAT
IT WAS A TEMPORARY BLACKOUT.

27:59.834 --> 28:01.792
- AND THE JUDGE FUCKING
BOUGHT THAT?

28:01.792 --> 28:05.291
- THE JUDGE THREW HIS CONFESSION
OUT OF COURT.

28:05.291 --> 28:06.500
HE WALKED.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.333

- TWO HOURS AGO.

28:08.333 --> 28:09.667

IS WHAT?

- WAIT AROUND TILL
HE KILLS SOMEONE ELSE?

28:23.291 --> 28:24.834
- THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
WE CAN DO.

28:24.834 --> 28:27.166

I CAN DO.

TO HIS HEAD.

ON ICE.

THIS GUN IS A 9-MIL.

ON MIKE ANDERSON.

29:42.875 --> 29:44.667

KILLED MIKE ANDERSON.

THE INVESTIGATION TO END

- YEAH.

30:08.792 --> 30:10.375
I MEAN, IT MAKES SENSE.

30:10.375 --> 30:13.041
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THIS ALEX
DUBROZNY HAD FEELINGS FOR HER,

30:13.041 --> 30:14.667
AND SHE WAS
IN LOVE WITH TONY.

30:14.667 --> 30:16.375

VERY WELL WITH HIM.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.500
- YEAH, I KNOW.

38:23.500 --> 38:26.041
- HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

38:26.041 --> 38:27.542
ALL HE'LL WANT TO DO
IS FOLLOW CODY AROUND.

38:27.542 --> 38:29.417
- THANKS FOR DRIVING HIM UP.

38:29.417 --> 38:31.000
- I ACTUALLY MIGHT SPEND
A FEW DAYS THERE,

38:31.000 --> 38:32.875
SEE WHAT TROUBLE
I CAN GET INTO.

38:32.875 --> 38:34.417
- KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

38:34.417 --> 38:38.291
- THANKS.
I'LL TAKE THESE DOWN TO THE CAR.

38:43.709 --> 38:47.458
- ASTOR AND CODY
ARE EXCITED TO SEE YOU.

38:47.458 --> 38:49.667
I WANT YOU TO BE GOOD FOR
YOUR GRANDMA AND GRANDPA, OKAY?

38:49.667 --> 38:52.333
I'M NOT SENDING
HARRISON TO ORLANDO

38:52.333 --> 38:54.625
BECAUSE DEB ASKED ME TO,

38:54.625 --> 38:57.625
BUT BECAUSE SPELTZER
IS A PROBLEM I NEED TO SOLVE.

38:57.625 --> 39:01.166
ONCE I DO, HARRISON WILL
COME HOME WHERE HE BELONGS.

39:01.166 --> 39:03.667
YOU MEAN MORE TO ME THAN...

39:03.667 --> 39:06.125
- PIZZA!

39:06.125 --> 39:07.625
- [laughs]
THAT'S RIGHT.

39:07.625 --> 39:09.667
PIZZA.

39:09.667 --> 39:12.291
LET'S GO.

40:20.792 --> 40:23.417
- [sobbing]

40:31.417 --> 40:33.750
- [speaking Russian]

40:42.667 --> 40:45.208
I WILL AVENGE YOUR DEATH.

40:48.917 --> 40:52.291
EVERYTHING I DO...

40:52.291 --> 40:55.375
IS FOR YOU.

41:13.583 --> 41:15.750
- DEB, YOU OKAY?

41:15.750 --> 41:18.667
- YE--
YEP.

41:18.667 --> 41:20.625
I WANT TO GET BACK
TO THE STATION

41:20.625 --> 41:23.250
AND FINISH UP THE PAPERWORK
ON MIKE'S SHOOTER.

41:23.250 --> 41:25.792
I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE.

41:26.959 --> 41:29.542
[engine turns on]

41:29.542 --> 41:31.583
[sighs]

41:36.041 --> 41:38.583
MOTHERFUCKER.

41:44.667 --> 41:47.333
YOU IMPOTENT FUCK.

41:47.333 --> 41:49.458
- YOU GOT SOME MOUTH ON YOU.

41:49.458 --> 41:50.875
- THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE?
HAVEN'T YOU DONE ENOUGH?

41:50.875 --> 41:52.750
- OH, I'M JUST
GETTING STARTED.

41:52.750 --> 41:55.000
- YOU FUCKING MOTHERFUCKING
COCKSUCKER!

41:55.000 --> 41:57.583
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
- YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT!

41:57.583 --> 41:58.750
- GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER.

41:58.750 --> 42:01.667
- YOU'RE SO EASY,
JUST LIKE THE OTHERS.

42:01.667 --> 42:04.583
- GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
COME ON.

42:04.583 --> 42:06.125
- FUCK YOU UP.

42:06.125 --> 42:09.542
- I'LL YOU SEE AROUND.

42:13.917 --> 42:15.625
[knock at door]

42:21.125 --> 42:22.959
- BATISTA CALLED.

42:24.834 --> 42:25.917
- I'M SURE HE DID.

42:25.917 --> 42:28.834
- WHA--WHAT HAPPENED?

42:30.458 --> 42:33.375
- I FUCKING LOST MY MIND.

42:33.375 --> 42:37.333
I SAW SPELTZER
AT MELANIE'S FUNERAL.

42:38.875 --> 42:41.166
FUCKIN' SMILING
AT THE HEARSE, AND--

42:41.166 --> 42:43.500
- WHAT'D YOU DO?

42:43.500 --> 42:44.667
- I FUCKING ATTACKED HIM!

42:44.667 --> 42:47.709
I WANTED TO FUCKING
KILL HIM.

42:49.250 --> 42:52.208
FUCK YOU.

42:52.208 --> 42:53.417
IS THAT WHY
YOU CAME HERE?

42:53.417 --> 42:55.041
TO PROVE SOME FUCKING POINT
THAT EVERYBODY

42:55.041 --> 42:56.667
WANTS SOMEONE DEAD?

42:56.667 --> 43:01.375
- I CAME HERE
TO SEE HOW YOU ARE.

43:01.375 --> 43:04.667
THAT'S ALL.

43:06.667 --> 43:09.792
- I'M JUST FUCKING GREAT.

43:12.083 --> 43:14.792
- [exhales]

43:17.792 --> 43:19.458
- [sighs]

43:24.333 --> 43:25.750
IS THIS EVER
GONNA GET EASIER?

43:25.750 --> 43:28.083
- NOTHING'S REALLY
ALL THAT DIFFERENT, DEB.

43:28.083 --> 43:31.542
- [scoffs]

43:36.291 --> 43:37.458
- THE ONLY THING
THAT'S CHANGED

43:37.458 --> 43:40.417
IS NOW
YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT ME.

43:40.417 --> 43:43.291
- WHAT I KNOW ABOUT YOU...

43:47.709 --> 43:50.166
MAKES YOU A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PERSON.

43:50.166 --> 43:51.875
- BUT I'M NOT.

43:51.875 --> 43:56.291
I'M THE SAME PERSON
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN.

43:56.291 --> 43:58.542
YOUR BROTHER,
THE SAME PERSON

43:58.542 --> 44:00.625
WHO WILL ALWAYS
BE THERE FOR YOU.

44:00.625 --> 44:03.458
- [exhales]

44:07.792 --> 44:11.792
- MAYBE THE QUESTION IS WHETHER
YOU'LL BE THERE FOR ME.

44:21.333 --> 44:24.333
- I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN
FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT US.

44:26.750 --> 44:29.000
- I DO.

44:32.667 --> 44:36.625
- I DO--

44:36.625 --> 44:39.542
[opens door]
AND I DON'T TOO.

45:07.667 --> 45:10.208
- ARE WE SURE THIS
ALEX DUBROZNY GUY

45:10.208 --> 45:12.625
SHOT MIKE ANDERSON?

45:12.625 --> 45:14.333
- WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU
TRYING TO RATTLE THIS?

45:14.333 --> 45:16.000
- 'CAUSE IT SMELLS
LIKE A SETUP.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.709
- AND WHAT DOES A SETUP
SMELL LIKE?

45:17.709 --> 45:19.792
- THIS BARTENDER HAD NO RECORD
BACK IN KURSK.

45:19.792 --> 45:22.250
SUDDENLY HE DECIDES
TO MURDER THREE PEOPLE?

45:22.250 --> 45:24.542
- ALEX HAD A SHORT FUSE,

45:24.542 --> 45:26.959
A BROKEN HEART,
A LOADED GUN.

45:26.959 --> 45:30.291
A GUN THAT MASUKA CONFIRMED
WAS THE SAME ONE USED ON MIKE.

45:30.291 --> 45:32.917
AND WE GOT A SWEET
LITTLE SUICIDE NOTE

45:32.917 --> 45:36.083
THAT HELPED US SOLVE NOT JUST
MIKE'S MURDER, BUT TWO OTHERS.

45:36.083 --> 45:38.667
- THAT'S WHAT
A SETUP SMELLS LIKE.

45:38.667 --> 45:41.208
IT'S ALL TOO NEAT,
TOO EASY.

45:41.208 --> 45:42.917
ALEX WASN'T EVEN
ON OUR RADAR.

45:42.917 --> 45:44.583
WHY WOULD
HE OFF HIMSELF NOW?

45:44.583 --> 45:47.750
- HIS CONSCIOUS
GOT TO HIM.

45:47.750 --> 45:49.667
- LET'S JUST
SWING BY THE CLUB

45:49.667 --> 45:52.208
ONE LAST TIME,
ASK AROUND.

45:52.208 --> 45:54.041
THIS IS MIKE
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.

45:54.041 --> 45:55.291
- [sighs]

45:55.291 --> 45:59.417
- FINE--
NOT TONIGHT.

45:59.417 --> 46:01.000
- WHAT'S HER NAME?
- NADIA.

46:01.000 --> 46:04.208
- THE STRIPPER?
- SHE'S A DANCER.

46:04.208 --> 46:06.000
JUST DOESN'T KEEP
A LOT OF HER CLOTHES ON.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.750
- YOU SERIOUS ABOUT HER?

46:07.750 --> 46:09.166
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I AM ABOUT HER.

46:09.166 --> 46:12.583
BUT SHE WAS REAL CLOSE
TO KAJA AND TONY,

46:12.583 --> 46:14.917
AND ALL THIS
IS REAL HARD ON HER.

46:14.917 --> 46:17.166
- OH, I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE THERE TO COMFORT HER.

46:17.166 --> 46:19.709
- COME ON.
- I'M JUST JEALOUS.

46:19.709 --> 46:21.083
AT LEAST YOU GOT
SOMEONE IN YOUR LIFE.

46:21.083 --> 46:23.250
- SHE'S GOT A LOT
OF PRETTY FRIENDS.

46:23.250 --> 46:24.709
I'M A TWICE-DIVORCED
DETECTIVE

46:24.709 --> 46:26.959
STARING DOWN THE BARREL
OF RETIREMENT.

46:26.959 --> 46:28.250
I'M ALREADY A CLICHE.

46:28.250 --> 46:30.458
NO NEED TO ADD FUCKING
A STRIPPER TO THAT LIST.

46:30.458 --> 46:32.583
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.
WE'LL GO BY THE CLUB TOMORROW,

46:32.583 --> 46:34.750
MAKE SURE ALEX ISN'T
SOME PATSY FOR THE MOB.

46:34.750 --> 46:37.917
- HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

46:53.458 --> 46:55.458
- FIGHT OR FLIGHT.

46:58.041 --> 47:01.000
THAT'S A PART OF EVERYONE'S
LIZARD BRAIN.

47:19.750 --> 47:23.291
SPELTZER MAY HAVE
A LIZARD BRAIN LIKE ME,

47:23.291 --> 47:24.625
BUT HIS SHORTCOMING
IS HE DOESN'T

47:24.625 --> 47:26.625
HAVE MUCH
OF A HUMAN BRAIN.

47:26.625 --> 47:28.250
- [grunts]

47:28.250 --> 47:30.291
[thud]

47:45.959 --> 47:47.542
[gasps]

47:47.542 --> 47:48.667
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?

47:48.667 --> 47:50.792
- THE END OF YOUR RUN.

47:53.375 --> 47:54.667
- GET ME OUT OF HERE!

47:54.667 --> 47:56.000
[metal clanking]

47:56.000 --> 47:58.667
- YELL ALL YOU WANT.
NO ONE'S GONNA HEAR YA.

47:58.667 --> 48:00.291
- FUCK.

48:00.291 --> 48:01.583
FUCK!

48:01.583 --> 48:05.959
- [mockingly]
FUCK! FUCK!

48:05.959 --> 48:07.542
FEELS GOOD.

48:07.542 --> 48:09.709
FUCK!

48:09.709 --> 48:12.709
- [breathes heavily]

48:12.709 --> 48:14.208
- NORMALLY NOW IS WHEN
I'D SLICE YOUR CHEEK

48:14.208 --> 48:15.917
WITH MY SCALPEL
AND GET A DROP OF BLOOD

48:15.917 --> 48:19.041
TO REMEMBER YOU BY,
BUT I CAN'T RISK

48:19.041 --> 48:21.208
ANYONE FINDING A BLOOD SLIDE
EVER AGAIN.

48:21.208 --> 48:23.750
- YOU'RE A FUCKIN' FREAK.

48:23.750 --> 48:27.125
- I DO THINGS
DIFFERENT NOW.

48:27.125 --> 48:29.709
THE MEMORY OF KILLING YOU
WILL HAVE TO BE ENOUGH.

48:29.709 --> 48:32.583
- I'M GONNA KILL YOU.

48:32.583 --> 48:36.417
- THAT WOULD BE A TWIST--

48:36.417 --> 48:40.667
AND NOT ONE THAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN TONIGHT.

48:40.667 --> 48:42.458
[fire roaring]

48:42.458 --> 48:44.417
- NO!

48:44.417 --> 48:46.208
[screams]

48:48.250 --> 48:49.834
- YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE A WAY OUT OF THE TANGLE

48:49.834 --> 48:52.542
I WAS IN WITH MY SISTER,

48:52.542 --> 48:55.750
A THREAD SHE COULD FOLLOW
TO UNDERSTAND ME BETTER,

48:55.750 --> 48:58.917
TO ACCEPT ME, EVEN.

48:58.917 --> 49:02.500
BUT SHE AND I LOST EACH OTHER.

49:02.500 --> 49:05.875
SHE ALMOST LOST HERSELF,
GOING AFTER YOU.

49:07.834 --> 49:12.083
SHE WANTED TO CATCH YOU
JUST AS MUCH AS I DID.

49:12.083 --> 49:13.750
WHO KNOWS, MAYBE
OUR RELATIONSHIP

49:13.750 --> 49:16.625
CAN RISE
FROM YOUR ASHES.

49:18.834 --> 49:20.250
- NO.

49:20.250 --> 49:21.625
NO!

49:21.625 --> 49:23.917
[screams]

49:54.834 --> 49:57.667
- IT'S TIME FOR EVERYONE
TO MOVE ON.

50:12.500 --> 50:15.625
GOOD-BYE, FRIENDS.

50:25.458 --> 50:27.291
[incinerator closes]

50:54.333 --> 50:56.500
[door opens]

51:01.709 --> 51:04.625
YOU CAME.

51:04.625 --> 51:06.542
I WASN'T SURE YOU WOULD.

51:06.542 --> 51:09.375
- ME NEITHER.

51:12.709 --> 51:16.333
WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

51:16.333 --> 51:20.166
- UH, THAT SMOKE...

51:29.917 --> 51:32.959
IT'S SPELTZER.

51:37.417 --> 51:40.125
[breathes deeply]

51:42.917 --> 51:45.792
- DID YOU DO THIS FOR ME?

51:51.583 --> 51:53.083
- NO.

51:53.083 --> 51:55.834
- [exhales]

51:55.834 --> 51:58.125
- [exhales]

52:01.250 --> 52:04.208
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

52:10.750 --> 52:13.792
- GLAD.

52:20.625 --> 52:24.208
[exhales]

52:24.208 --> 52:27.333
WHAT DOES THAT MAKE ME?

52:34.083 --> 52:36.125
- HUMAN.
