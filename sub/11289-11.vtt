WEBVTT

00:02.066 --> 00:03.333
Good news, <i>mon amie.</i>

00:03.400 --> 00:06.900
We just sublet Kyle's apartment
to a fellow artist.

00:06.966 --> 00:09.400
Listen to the story now.

00:09.466 --> 00:13.566
(Roni)
'Alright, this next one goes out
to Boo Bear from Sweet Pea.'

00:13.633 --> 00:15.266
'Boo Bear, you must be
truly loved'

00:15.333 --> 00:16.332
'because this is the fifth song'

00:16.400 --> 00:18.000
'your lady
has requested tonight.'

00:18.066 --> 00:19.366
'Oh, and, Sweet Pea..'

00:19.433 --> 00:22.066
'Girl, put that phone down
and get with your man.'

00:24.200 --> 00:25.600
I did.

00:25.666 --> 00:28.166
Half an hour later, we were
requesting "Love Hangover."

00:28.233 --> 00:30.466
‐ Mmm.
‐ Yes, we were..

00:30.533 --> 00:32.800
No girl,
it was more like two hours.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.300
And the song was, "Didn't I
blow your mind this time."

00:35.366 --> 00:36.733
‐ Oh, shh, hush up now!
‐ Ooh..

00:36.800 --> 00:39.100
‐ Hush up now. Hush up now.
‐ 'Wait, wait. One minute.'

00:39.166 --> 00:42.566
Roni D from WNKW is moving in
and nobody ran it past me?

00:42.633 --> 00:45.133
Well, we also had
pancakes with breakfast.

00:45.200 --> 00:48.600
Should we have cleared that
with you too, mother?

00:48.666 --> 00:50.933
I'm, I'm just saying.
It's a small brownstone.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.500
We can't help but be all up
in each other's business.

00:53.566 --> 00:55.366
I mean, how you know
this girl is gonna fit in?

00:55.433 --> 00:56.500
[knock on door]

00:56.566 --> 00:57.900
Why don't you ask her?

00:59.733 --> 01:01.640
Inviting her over already?

01:05.440 --> 01:07.006
‐ Khadijah James?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

01:07.073 --> 01:09.139
‐ Roni De Santos.
‐ Hi.

01:09.206 --> 01:12.340
Can I just tell you
that "Flavor" magazine

01:12.406 --> 01:14.340
changed my life.

01:15.306 --> 01:16.640
[chuckles]

01:16.706 --> 01:18.573
Would you look at her, girl?
Come on in.

01:19.740 --> 01:21.373
Didn't I tell you
she'd fit right in?

01:21.440 --> 01:22.840

02:05.080 --> 02:07.346
These grapes or your fingers.

02:08.979 --> 02:10.613
Well, I'm almost out of grapes.

02:11.580 --> 02:13.513
So, feel free to nip.

02:15.446 --> 02:16.879
Mm.

02:16.946 --> 02:19.613
I have missed you so much,
cutie‐pootie.

02:19.679 --> 02:21.280
Well, I'm here now, baby.

02:21.346 --> 02:23.180
What do you say
we make up for lost time?

02:23.246 --> 02:25.480
Mm‐hmm.

02:25.546 --> 02:28.213
Khadijah, wake up!
We gotta go!

02:28.280 --> 02:30.780
Wake up. Wake up!
C'mon! We gotta go. We gotta go.

02:30.846 --> 02:32.713
Stop!

02:32.780 --> 02:34.513
Damn!

02:35.780 --> 02:38.480
Damn! Scooter was
just about to kiss me.

02:42.046 --> 02:45.046
Yeah, well.
Pillows don't have lips, baby.

02:45.113 --> 02:47.446
Let's go. C'mon.

02:47.513 --> 02:50.246
I don't know why it is
I always dream about him.

02:50.313 --> 02:53.546
I ain't seen him ever since
we broke off our engagement.

02:53.613 --> 02:55.813
But yet, every time..

02:58.046 --> 02:59.846
Every time I fall asleep

02:59.913 --> 03:02.220
we're making waves
in some hot tub.

03:06.653 --> 03:08.586
What the hell are you doing?

03:10.386 --> 03:12.420
Look, I'm getting you
ready for the weekend.

03:12.486 --> 03:14.353
Check‐in's at 4 o'clock.

03:14.420 --> 03:16.353
And they're predicting
a snowstorm.

03:18.086 --> 03:20.586
"Vishnu's new age weekend.

03:20.653 --> 03:24.853
Explore the greatest mystery
of the universe. You."

03:24.920 --> 03:28.786
Yup. Peace and quiet.
Spirituality..

03:28.853 --> 03:30.786
All that crap.

03:34.420 --> 03:36.353
I ain't going to no.. Um..

03:39.186 --> 03:41.186
I ain't going
to no kook fest, yo.

03:41.253 --> 03:43.886
I'm spending my weekend
right on this couch.

03:43.953 --> 03:49.220
Having freaky dreams
that scare the hell out of me.

03:49.286 --> 03:51.686
You know,
I am always there for you.

03:51.753 --> 03:54.286
Now it's time for you
to do something for me.

03:54.353 --> 03:56.453
Remember that Jesus guy
I defended?

03:56.520 --> 03:58.153
Well, he threw my life
out of whack.

03:58.220 --> 04:00.293
And now I need to go
find my life's purpose

04:00.360 --> 04:01.860
damn it.

04:04.026 --> 04:07.293
Well, I'm dressed for it,
I might as well go.

04:08.860 --> 04:11.426
Hey! What's going on? Where're
we going? What's happenin'?

04:13.293 --> 04:16.293
Khadijah and I are going
on a New Age retreat.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.826
You can, uh, water our plants.
Let's go.

04:21.192 --> 04:22.460
Oh!

04:22.526 --> 04:23.826
You know,
I just moved downstairs.

04:23.893 --> 04:25.993
I didn't move
out of your lives, I..

04:28.593 --> 04:30.860
Oh, please.

04:30.926 --> 04:33.426
Alright, you can go,
you big baby.

04:34.859 --> 04:37.559
Oh, I didn't know you had
your own little tool set.

04:37.626 --> 04:39.459
‐ Yeah, yeah.
‐ What are they? Fisher‐Price?

04:39.526 --> 04:40.926
[laughs]

04:40.993 --> 04:43.826
Look, just 'cause I don't have
a shiny red box to keep 'em in

04:43.893 --> 04:45.826
does not mean
that I don't have skills.

04:45.893 --> 04:48.360
No bro,
it's pronounced <i>shkills.</i>

04:52.493 --> 04:53.993
Mm! My first house warming gift.

04:54.060 --> 04:56.093
So, when do I get
the rest of the bike? Christmas?

04:56.160 --> 04:58.560
Nah, not if he's fixing it.

04:58.626 --> 04:59.593
Uh, yo, Trip.

04:59.660 --> 05:00.733
Like you to meet
our new neighbor.

05:00.800 --> 05:01.766
This is Roni De‐‐

05:01.833 --> 05:03.400
De Santos.

05:03.466 --> 05:04.666
You're the new neighbor?

05:04.733 --> 05:06.633
You live here too?

05:06.700 --> 05:10.500
I mean, uh..
Hi. How are you?

05:12.800 --> 05:14.333
Uh, what was the question?

05:14.400 --> 05:17.166
I don't know.
I, I have to go.

05:17.233 --> 05:20.000
Umm, my bananas, you know,
they're getting cold.

05:20.066 --> 05:21.500
Bye.

05:24.233 --> 05:26.966
Uh‐huh. Uh, just a guess, bro.

05:27.033 --> 05:29.700
But, uh, you two
seen each other naked?

05:33.900 --> 05:35.233
Che‐check it, check it.

05:35.300 --> 05:39.133
Six months ago, I won this
contest on WNKW radio. Right?

05:39.200 --> 05:40.666
It was, sing an original song

05:40.733 --> 05:43.033
and win a evening of dinner
and dancing with Roni D.

05:43.100 --> 05:44.833
‐ Right.
‐ Man the next thing I know..

05:44.900 --> 05:46.733
We're back in my crib
doing the six‐inch stride.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.133
Hmm.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.166
Yeah, beats the hell out
of winning a pair of vise grips

05:50.233 --> 05:52.966
in the Mr. Fix It competition.

05:53.033 --> 05:54.233
Yeah, but‐but dig it.

05:54.300 --> 05:58.400
The next day, I send her
a dozen roses, long stem.

05:58.466 --> 06:00.266
A‐a‐and you know
what she sends me?

06:00.333 --> 06:03.473
A note saying, uh, "Good luck
on your future endeavors.

06:03.540 --> 06:06.640
Enjoy your free WNKW
bumper sticker."

06:06.706 --> 06:10.240
Hm. Damn, you got played.

06:10.306 --> 06:12.606
But, you know.. Hey, I'm cool!

06:12.673 --> 06:14.373
I mean, you know,
that's on her.

06:14.440 --> 06:17.306
I‐I‐I mean, she's the one
missing out on all this, right?

06:17.373 --> 06:18.806
‐ Right?
‐ Yeah.

06:18.873 --> 06:19.973
‐ Thought so.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.540
I'm gonna go ahead and go home
and get cleaned up.

06:21.606 --> 06:22.740
‐ Alright.
‐ Later, man.

06:22.806 --> 06:24.406
‐ Uh, yo, Trip.
‐ Yo, what's up, dawg?

06:24.473 --> 06:27.306
Um, you live in, in there.

06:27.373 --> 06:28.640
[laughs]

06:28.706 --> 06:30.640
Yeah, yeah.

06:31.440 --> 06:32.606
[bell rings]

06:32.673 --> 06:35.406
(Vishnu)
Welcome! I'm Vishnu!

06:35.473 --> 06:37.540
The past life workshop
is about to begin.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.706
You know, they're not
getting me up there.

06:39.773 --> 06:41.006
Remember when
y'all hypnotized me

06:41.073 --> 06:42.240
at that frat party?

06:42.306 --> 06:44.140
You had me paintin' my face
with guacamole

06:44.206 --> 06:46.940
and singin' a show tune.

06:47.006 --> 06:48.906
Is that all you remember?

06:48.973 --> 06:50.506
Good.

06:51.773 --> 06:53.773
Now, this is the hardest part.

06:53.840 --> 06:56.006
Finding a brave soul
that's willing

06:56.073 --> 06:59.573
to expose their spiritual
nakedness to strings.

07:01.113 --> 07:02.546
I'm here.

07:02.613 --> 07:04.513
Expose me.

07:06.646 --> 07:10.746
Focus...on the crystal.

07:12.280 --> 07:13.446
[exhales]

07:13.513 --> 07:15.880
Breathe deeply.

07:15.946 --> 07:17.013
[inhales]

07:17.080 --> 07:20.180
Clear your mind..

07:20.246 --> 07:21.380
...and get off my foot.

07:21.446 --> 07:23.180
Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

07:30.180 --> 07:32.080
Alright, Maxine.

07:32.146 --> 07:33.180
I'm gonna now take you back

07:33.246 --> 07:35.846
through the birth canal
to your past lives.

07:35.913 --> 07:37.746
Each time you hear the bell

07:37.813 --> 07:40.413
you will travel to another life.

07:40.480 --> 07:44.313
So, fasten your
spiritual safety belts.

07:44.380 --> 07:45.313
[bell rings]

07:45.380 --> 07:47.313
[growls]

07:49.046 --> 07:50.980
[speaking in foreign language]

07:52.713 --> 07:53.813
(Max)
'Whoa!'

07:53.880 --> 07:56.780
Oh, junk.
Max was a sumo wrestler!

07:56.846 --> 07:57.946
[bell rings]

07:58.013 --> 08:00.753
<i>Toro! Toro!</i>

08:00.820 --> 08:02.953
[ululating]

08:03.020 --> 08:04.120
<i>Toro!</i>

08:04.186 --> 08:07.586
<i>Ole! Ole!</i>

08:07.653 --> 08:10.653
<i>Ohh! Senorita!</i>

08:10.720 --> 08:14.020
Ohh, ohh!

08:14.086 --> 08:15.553
<i>Que bonita.</i>

08:15.620 --> 08:17.853
‐ Well, <i>muchas gracias.</i>
‐ <i>Ah! Que bonita.</i>

08:17.920 --> 08:19.053
Alright, ring the bell!

08:19.120 --> 08:20.220
Vishnu, ring the bell!

08:20.286 --> 08:21.953
‐ Ring the bell! Ring the bell!
‐ 'Maxine..'

08:25.353 --> 08:28.086
Maxine, I'm going to bring you
back to the present now.

08:28.153 --> 08:29.920
When you awaken,
you will be refreshed

08:29.986 --> 08:32.453
and fully aware
of all that has happened.

08:32.520 --> 08:34.953
[rings bell]

08:35.020 --> 08:37.352
Hm, girl, get off me.
What're you doing?

08:39.320 --> 08:42.520
Max, now we know why
you're so good at arm wrestling.

08:42.586 --> 08:45.253
Your cosmic cup runneth over
with men.

08:47.720 --> 08:50.786
Yo, I hope there's
some women in here because, uh

08:50.853 --> 08:52.786
these men are kicking my ass.

08:58.286 --> 09:01.426
Synclaire, that's
the hot tub from my dreams!

09:01.493 --> 09:05.193
Yeah. Look, this is it.

09:05.260 --> 09:07.226
This is the deck.

09:07.293 --> 09:09.326
And the candles.

09:09.393 --> 09:11.326
What the hell is going on here?

09:12.193 --> 09:14.260
Oh. Spooky.

09:15.293 --> 09:16.626
Guess who?

09:17.993 --> 09:19.126
Scooter?

09:19.193 --> 09:20.926
Girl, what in the world
are you doing here?

09:31.393 --> 09:32.826
Yo, look. I don't care if I
have to walk back to Brooklyn.

09:32.893 --> 09:35.560
I'm out of here. Word is bond.

09:35.626 --> 09:37.493
So what, you ran
in to an ex‐boyfriend.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.126
Big freakin' deal.

09:39.193 --> 09:40.426
I found out that I used to be

09:40.493 --> 09:42.760
a 300‐pound Japanese man
in diapers.

09:44.860 --> 09:46.393
Haven't you been listening?

09:46.460 --> 09:49.060
Man, I've never been here
before in my life.

09:49.126 --> 09:52.593
So, how is it that I have
a dream about that hot tub

09:52.660 --> 09:55.893
a‐a‐and then that Scooter,
and there it is and there he is.

09:57.993 --> 10:00.160
We're talking fate, Khadijah.

10:00.226 --> 10:03.800
The universe wants you two
crazy kids to be together.

10:03.866 --> 10:07.233
So, jump in that tub of love and
get your cosmic groove on, okay?

10:10.066 --> 10:12.600
Okay, I'm going
to check Scooter.

10:12.666 --> 10:13.966
I mean,
whatever happens with him

10:14.033 --> 10:16.600
can't be as scary
as the mumbo jumbo

10:16.666 --> 10:19.366
you and Pinhead here

10:19.433 --> 10:21.133
are freaking pushing.

10:29.966 --> 10:31.866
Oh, boy. Do I feel foolish?

10:31.933 --> 10:33.400
I forgot about the brownstone's

10:33.466 --> 10:35.866
new take out the trash
dress code.

10:35.933 --> 10:37.600
Hey. Hey. Hey.

10:37.666 --> 10:38.966
What's wrong with a brother

10:39.033 --> 10:41.966
taking a little pride
in his appearance, huh?

10:42.033 --> 10:43.466
Oh, nothing, nothing.

10:43.533 --> 10:46.066
I particularly enjoyed
that little Tommy Hilfiger

10:46.133 --> 10:49.000
ensemble you wore down
to the laundry room.

10:49.066 --> 10:51.300
Uh, not to mention
the silk dashiki you

10:51.366 --> 10:54.266
you were sporting
to pick up your mail.

10:54.333 --> 10:56.233
Either you've been possessed
by the spirit of Kyle

10:56.300 --> 10:58.033

of Miss Rawr Roni.

of my life? Huh?

some more caffeine.

was extract of valerian root.

I spiked it with my own

You know, if you smuggled in
some buffalo wings

12:11.646 --> 12:13.846

we'd have a party.
