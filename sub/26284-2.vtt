00:02.044 --> 00:03.879
<i>Previously on</i> Young Sheldon...

00:03.963 --> 00:06.090
I've been corresponding
with Dr. John Sturgis

00:06.173 --> 00:07.508
<i>at East Texas Tech.</i>

00:07.591 --> 00:09.260
<i>He said I could audit
his course.</i>

00:09.343 --> 00:10.553
I'm John Sturgis.

00:10.636 --> 00:12.471
Sheldon invited me to dinner.

00:12.555 --> 00:15.349
Spaghetti and hot dogs
is delightful.

00:15.433 --> 00:16.642
You're only here temporarily?

00:16.726 --> 00:18.060
That's the plan for now,

00:18.144 --> 00:22.273
but I could be enticed to stay.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.796
I do believe there
was subtext there.

00:23.858 --> 00:24.859
Did you pick up on it?

00:27.194 --> 00:29.697
Okay. I'll see you later.

00:29.780 --> 00:31.500
Are you sure
you don't want to stay with me?

00:31.532 --> 00:33.677
I don't think so. I don't really
understand this stuff.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.995
That's how I felt
when we watched <i>Dirty Dancing,</i>

00:36.078 --> 00:37.121
and I stayed.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.849
When Patrick Swayze
takes his shirt off in here,

00:38.873 --> 00:40.833
I'll be back.
You have a good one.

00:48.632 --> 00:50.426
Hello.

00:50.509 --> 00:51.509
Hi.

00:52.762 --> 00:53.971
Who are you?

00:54.055 --> 00:55.181
I'm Paige.

00:55.264 --> 00:56.974
I like your bow tie.

00:57.058 --> 00:58.392
Thank you.

00:58.476 --> 00:59.852
You seem awfully young,
Paige.

00:59.935 --> 01:02.229
Are you with an adult
who's taking this class?

01:02.313 --> 01:04.690
No. Dr. Sturgis heard
about my research

01:04.774 --> 01:07.026
on quantum chromodynamics
at high temperatures

01:07.109 --> 01:09.236
and invited me
to audit his course.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.488
Is that so?

01:10.571 --> 01:12.948
Yes. He's been super nice.

01:13.032 --> 01:15.451
Interesting. Well,
just so we're clear,

01:15.534 --> 01:17.912
he's my mentor,
he's my meemaw's boyfriend,

01:17.995 --> 01:20.748
and he had spaghetti
and hot dogs at my house.

01:20.831 --> 01:24.085
The spaghetti
goes on the hot dogs?

01:24.168 --> 01:25.169
No.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.254
You realize
this is a very advanced class.

01:27.338 --> 01:28.254
We'll be discussing

01:28.255 --> 01:30.549
deriving nuclear physics
from the quark model.

01:30.633 --> 01:32.986
Do you know if he'll be doing
a full color octet calculation

01:33.010 --> 01:35.096
with matrix manipulations?

01:36.222 --> 01:37.264
I do not.

01:37.348 --> 01:39.725
Do you know how to differentiate
under the integral sign?

01:40.684 --> 01:41.685
No.

01:41.769 --> 01:44.146
Well, do you know anything?

01:45.481 --> 01:47.024
I know you're in my spot.

01:48.317 --> 01:51.487
<i>♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪</i>

01:51.570 --> 01:53.906
<i>♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪</i>

01:53.989 --> 01:56.617
<i>♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪</i>

01:56.700 --> 01:59.453
<i>♪ I am a mighty little man ♪</i>

01:59.537 --> 02:02.873
<i>♪ I am a mighty little man ♪</i>

02:10.131 --> 02:11.632
How old are you?

02:11.715 --> 02:13.008
I'm ten.

02:13.092 --> 02:14.552
I'm ten, too.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.053
When's your birthday?

02:16.137 --> 02:18.139
February 26th.

02:18.222 --> 02:20.266
March 17th.

02:20.975 --> 02:22.518
I'm the youngest person
in this class.

02:22.601 --> 02:24.436
That's funny.

02:27.231 --> 02:29.150
Oh, good.

02:29.233 --> 02:30.651
I see you two have met.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.111
I'm younger than him.

02:32.194 --> 02:35.156
How come you never mentioned
she was coming to this class?

02:35.239 --> 02:37.324
I thought it would be
a fun surprise.

02:37.408 --> 02:38.784
I don't like surprises.

02:38.868 --> 02:40.202
Neither do I.

02:40.286 --> 02:41.745
Then why did you do it?

02:41.829 --> 02:43.706
Some people like surprises.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.249
I love surprises.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.750
Did you enjoy this one?

02:46.834 --> 02:49.753
- Yes.
- A 50 percent success rate.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.590
Not bad. Let's get started.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.677
<i>Not since sharing
a uterus with my twin sister</i>

02:56.760 --> 02:59.138
<i>have I been so unhappy
sitting next to someone.</i>

03:02.016 --> 03:03.767
<i>♪ Taking it slow ♪</i>

03:05.477 --> 03:07.605
<i>♪ And Lord, don't you know ♪</i>

03:07.688 --> 03:09.773
Awful quiet back there.

03:11.609 --> 03:14.445
I'm having an emotion
I'm unfamiliar with.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.864
Hmm. Think it might
have something to do

03:16.947 --> 03:18.407
with your new classmate?

03:18.490 --> 03:19.658
It's possible.

03:19.742 --> 03:22.912
She's the only variable
in the social equation.

03:22.995 --> 03:24.663
So what are you feeling?

03:24.747 --> 03:26.624
My face is hot,

03:26.707 --> 03:28.167
I have a knot in my stomach,

03:28.250 --> 03:30.794
and I'm resisting the urge
to kick your seat right now.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.963
I'm thinking it
might be jealousy.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.673
No, that's not in my nature.

03:34.757 --> 03:37.551
All right, let's go through
all the emotions.

03:37.635 --> 03:38.928
I'm looking at your face,

03:39.011 --> 03:41.555
so I'm gonna rule out happy.

03:41.639 --> 03:42.806
Are you sad?

03:42.890 --> 03:44.642
No, there's too much anger
in there.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.018
Oh, well, maybe you're angry.

03:46.101 --> 03:47.853
No, there's too much sad
in there.

03:47.937 --> 03:49.480
Maybe you got a little crush
on her.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.273
Do you want me
to kick your seat?

03:51.857 --> 03:53.359
I don't know, Moonpie.

03:53.442 --> 03:55.778
I'm still thinking
it might be jealousy.

03:55.861 --> 03:58.572
Give me one reason
why I would be jealous.

03:58.656 --> 04:01.742
Well, Dr. Sturgis
means a lot to you,

04:01.825 --> 04:03.744
and now he's paying
attention to somebody else.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.913
You're used to being
the only smart kid around,

04:05.996 --> 04:08.123
and now there's another.

04:08.207 --> 04:09.583
Oh, and there's
the possibility...

04:09.667 --> 04:11.210
I said one reason, thank you.

04:11.293 --> 04:13.712
<i>♪ Yeah... ♪</i>

04:17.341 --> 04:18.341
Hello?

04:18.425 --> 04:19.635
<i>Hello, Mary.</i>

04:19.718 --> 04:21.303
This is John Sturgis,

04:21.387 --> 04:24.515
Sheldon's professor
and your mother's lover.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.518
Hi. And "John"
was more than enough.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.646
I was calling because there's
a new student in my class

04:30.729 --> 04:32.064
who's Sheldon's age.

04:32.147 --> 04:33.440
No kidding.

04:33.524 --> 04:37.403
Her mother wondered if I could
put you two in contact

04:37.486 --> 04:39.405
<i>since you have so much
in common.</i>

04:39.488 --> 04:42.199
Oh, of course.

04:42.283 --> 04:43.284
Excellent.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.452
<i>I'll give you the number
when you're ready.</i>

04:45.536 --> 04:46.829
Um...

04:46.912 --> 04:49.581
<i>I am ready.</i>

04:49.665 --> 04:55.296
409-356-6049.

04:55.379 --> 04:56.422
John?

04:56.505 --> 04:57.673
Yes?

04:57.756 --> 04:58.799
That's my number.

04:59.466 --> 05:02.136
So it is!

05:05.180 --> 05:06.890
This is so exciting.

05:07.599 --> 05:10.185
Don't you understand
what this means?

05:10.269 --> 05:12.688
Rather than me feel dumb,
how about you just tell me?

05:12.771 --> 05:16.233
These are parents
we can actually relate to.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.944
- Yeah, sure.
- All the times we wonder

05:19.028 --> 05:21.572
if we're doing right by Sheldon
or how to handle him,

05:21.655 --> 05:23.615
we finally have someone
to compare notes with.

05:23.699 --> 05:24.950
There's notes?

05:25.034 --> 05:26.452
I've just been winging it.

05:26.535 --> 05:28.662
- I'm gonna call her right now.
- Sounds good.

05:30.247 --> 05:31.957
Oh, thank you, Lord,
for connecting us

05:32.041 --> 05:34.293
with the parents
of another special child.

05:37.629 --> 05:40.382
You kids are special, too.

05:41.884 --> 05:43.469
Do you feel special?

05:43.552 --> 05:45.304
At least
I'm the only daughter.

05:45.387 --> 05:46.847
You got nothing.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.640
And she's such a know-it-all.

05:48.724 --> 05:50.017
Yeah, you mentioned that.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.643
I'm surprised her
arm wasn't sore

05:51.727 --> 05:53.062
from raising her hand so much.

05:53.145 --> 05:54.396
Yep, sure.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.106
And who goes to college
with stickers

05:56.190 --> 05:57.691
on their notepad?

05:57.775 --> 05:58.859
I don't know.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.903
Unicorn stickers.

06:00.986 --> 06:02.654
And we're home.

06:02.738 --> 06:04.156
Hey, Shelly.

06:04.239 --> 06:05.866
Guess who's coming
over tomorrow?

06:05.949 --> 06:08.369
Your new friend Paige.

06:08.452 --> 06:10.412
Okay, I'm gonna go.

06:16.794 --> 06:19.755
Come on, Shelly. Maybe
you'll end up being friends.

06:19.838 --> 06:20.964
I don't like her,

06:21.048 --> 06:22.609
I'm not going to like her,
and Tam is my friend.

06:22.633 --> 06:23.926
I don't need another one.

06:24.009 --> 06:25.928
You can have more
than one friend.

06:26.011 --> 06:28.055
I'm sure Tam
has other friends.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.932
No, I'm all he's got.

06:30.015 --> 06:32.434
And even I avoid him
half the time.

06:32.518 --> 06:34.144
Also, you don't have
any friends.

06:34.228 --> 06:35.771
Why are you so worried about me?

06:36.688 --> 06:38.357
I have friends.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.984
Then how come the only person
who ever comes over is Meemaw?

06:41.068 --> 06:42.277
Because...

06:42.361 --> 06:44.071
Okay, this isn't about me.

06:44.154 --> 06:47.199
So Paige didn't make a
good first impression,

06:47.282 --> 06:48.492
but that can change.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.703
What's that new <i>Star Trek</i> show?

06:51.787 --> 06:53.664
<i>Next Generation?</i>

06:53.747 --> 06:56.708
When that first came on,
you said a new <i>Star Trek</i>

06:56.792 --> 06:58.669
without Dr. Spock
could never be good,

06:58.752 --> 07:00.963
but I've seen you watching it.

07:01.046 --> 07:03.340
Well, first of all,
it's Mr. Spock.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.634
Dr. Spock writes books
about babies.

07:05.717 --> 07:07.219
My apologies.

07:07.302 --> 07:09.555
And second of all,
Paige isn't a TV show.

07:09.638 --> 07:12.683
She's a person, and we all know
how I feel about people.

07:18.981 --> 07:20.190
Okay, look.

07:20.691 --> 07:21.984
You're right.

07:25.237 --> 07:27.865
I don't have many friends,

07:27.948 --> 07:31.743
so I was hoping
to get to know Paige's mom.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.624
But if it makes you
uncomfortable,

07:37.708 --> 07:40.335
then I will call her
and cancel.

07:44.423 --> 07:46.800
I'll think about it.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.970
Thank you, baby.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.264
<i>Guilt and jealousy
in the same day.</i>

07:52.347 --> 07:54.600
<i>I slept hard that night.</i>

07:57.102 --> 07:58.228
Mmm.

07:59.021 --> 08:02.065
Did you know that there's a type
of vanilla flavoring

08:02.149 --> 08:04.359
derived from the anal glands

08:04.443 --> 08:06.236
of the North American beaver?

08:06.320 --> 08:08.238
That seems like a fact
you could have shared

08:08.322 --> 08:09.698
before we started eating.

08:09.781 --> 08:11.617
It isn't used very often.

08:11.700 --> 08:15.579
I understand it's difficult
to, uh, milk the little sacs.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.457
Cool. Okay, new topic.

08:18.540 --> 08:20.292
Let's talk about Sheldon.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.002
Wonderful. What about him?

08:22.085 --> 08:25.881
He's having kind of a hard time
with the new girl in your class.

08:26.465 --> 08:27.758
Really? Why?

08:27.841 --> 08:30.552
He's jealous of the attention
you're paying her.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.096
Well, she's remarkable.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.140
You see that? Less of that.

08:35.224 --> 08:37.183
But I think
he's remarkable, too.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.027
Perfect. More of that,
less of the other one.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.895
Understood.

08:40.979 --> 08:43.649
See, this is why
we're great together.

08:43.732 --> 08:46.193
You teach me
about social etiquette,

08:46.276 --> 08:48.737
and I teach you
about beaver anuses.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.739
It is magical.

08:50.822 --> 08:54.743
Did you know "ani"
is also acceptable

08:54.826 --> 08:56.411
as the plural of "anus"?

08:56.495 --> 08:58.830
And the magic continues.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.800
<i>Must have been most
difficult for you to share.</i>

09:04.836 --> 09:06.505
<i>The thought
of spending an afternoon</i>

09:06.588 --> 09:08.549
<i>with Paige seemed excruciating,</i>

09:08.632 --> 09:10.676
<i>but I wanted
to make my mother happy.</i>

09:10.759 --> 09:12.302
<i>I was torn.</i>

09:12.386 --> 09:14.179
<i>The release of emotions,
Mr. Spock,</i>

09:14.263 --> 09:16.890
<i>is what keeps us healthy...</i>

09:16.974 --> 09:18.767
<i>emotionally healthy, that is.</i>

09:18.850 --> 09:21.812
<i>Luckily, the wise
words of Gene Roddenberry,</i>

09:21.895 --> 09:23.814
<i>flatly delivered
by Leonard Nimoy,</i>

09:23.897 --> 09:25.440
<i>resolved my dilemma.</i>

09:25.524 --> 09:27.401
<i>That may be, Doctor.</i>

09:27.484 --> 09:30.028
<i>However, I have noted</i>

09:30.112 --> 09:33.782
<i>that the healthy release
of emotion</i>

09:33.865 --> 09:36.326
<i>is frequently very unhealthy.</i>

09:36.410 --> 09:39.955
<i>I realized if Mr. Spock
could rise above his emotions</i>

09:40.038 --> 09:42.416
<i>while the fate of the</i>
Enterprise <i>hung in the balance,</i>

09:42.499 --> 09:46.336
<i>certainly I could tolerate
Paige for a few hours.</i>

09:46.420 --> 09:47.963
I'm not watching this crap.

09:48.046 --> 09:49.715
<i>Why do I listen to you?</i>

09:50.882 --> 09:53.135
<i>Tony, this is going
to help you choose a major.</i>

09:53.218 --> 09:55.470
<i>This test is designed
to help you focus.</i>

09:55.554 --> 09:57.474
<i>I know, but what if it
says all I'm good at is...</i>

09:57.514 --> 09:58.515
What are you doing?

09:58.599 --> 10:00.517
Suppressing my emotions.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.561
Oh, yeah? Suppress this.

10:05.856 --> 10:07.774
Hot dogs.

10:12.195 --> 10:15.032
<i>Vulcans use
a technique called</i> Kolinahr

10:15.115 --> 10:16.366
<i>to suppress their emotions.</i>

10:16.450 --> 10:17.951
Sheldon,
they're here!

10:18.035 --> 10:19.745
<i>Obviously, I wasn't a Vulcan.</i>

10:19.828 --> 10:21.413
<i>So I did the next best thing:</i>

10:21.496 --> 10:23.957
<i>Took my feelings
and shoved them down so far</i>

10:24.041 --> 10:25.626
<i>they may have been lost
forever.</i>

10:25.709 --> 10:27.669
Hi, Sheldon!

10:27.753 --> 10:29.713
<i>The release of emotions,
Mr. Spock,</i>

10:29.796 --> 10:31.715
<i>is what keeps us healthy.</i>

10:32.341 --> 10:34.468
<i>Dr. McCoy was an idiot.</i>

10:38.639 --> 10:40.641
Well, you just have
a beautiful home.

10:40.724 --> 10:43.310
- Thank you.
- Can I interest anyone

10:43.393 --> 10:44.811
in something stronger
than iced tea?

10:44.895 --> 10:46.772
Oh, well, I'll take a beer
if you have one.

10:46.855 --> 10:48.607
Don't worry.
He's personally keeping

10:48.690 --> 10:51.109
the Lone Star Brewing Company
in business.

10:52.235 --> 10:53.654
They did send me a belt buckle.

10:53.737 --> 10:55.656
Be right back.

10:56.615 --> 10:58.867
So, Barry, uh,
Linda tells me

10:58.950 --> 11:00.535
- you're a dentist?
- Uh, yes.

11:00.619 --> 11:01.912
I have a practice up
in Jasper.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.956
Uh, Paige actually does some
of the bookkeeping for us.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.208
That's so funny.

11:06.291 --> 11:07.709
Sheldon does our taxes.

11:07.793 --> 11:09.795
- Oh!
- Yeah, we used to pay her

11:09.878 --> 11:11.088
in stickers,
but this year,

11:11.171 --> 11:12.651
she actually started
asking for money.

11:12.714 --> 11:14.034
Well, don't let Sheldon
hear that.

11:14.091 --> 11:15.342
We pay him in binder clips.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.511
He loves being organized.

11:17.594 --> 11:18.595
Boy, does he.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.698
We can't go to the grocery store
without him making sure

11:20.722 --> 11:22.724
that all the labels
are facing the right way.

11:22.808 --> 11:26.186
Oh, the stock boys there
are always so happy to see him.

11:27.312 --> 11:28.689
- That's adorable.
- Well,

11:28.772 --> 11:30.774
it wasn't adorable
when we redid our shower

11:30.857 --> 11:33.735
and he wouldn't use it 'cause
two of the tiles were crooked.

11:33.819 --> 11:35.070
He took baths
in the sink

11:35.153 --> 11:36.405
until we got it fixed.

11:38.365 --> 11:41.368
So does Paige do
any quirky stuff like that?

11:43.036 --> 11:44.788
- No.
- Not really.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.707
Oh.

11:47.999 --> 11:50.252
Now, since we'll be spending
a few hours together,

11:50.335 --> 11:52.713
I've created a list of
activities to keep us occupied.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.156
We'll start with
a tour of my room,

11:54.214 --> 11:56.174
then board games,
and if time permits,

11:56.258 --> 11:58.510
you can look at
and not touch my trains.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.262
Oh, My Little Pony.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.222
I love My Little Pony.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.474
That's my sister's,
and it's not part of the tour.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.309
I share a room
with my sister, too.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.811
It's super fun.

12:07.894 --> 12:08.895
You're wrong.

12:09.646 --> 12:12.065
Now, over here, we have my desk.

12:12.149 --> 12:14.860
This is my computer.
That's my mouse.

12:14.943 --> 12:17.779
This is my printer. This is the
paper that goes in the printer.

12:17.863 --> 12:19.531
This is a box of extra paper

12:19.614 --> 12:21.324
that also goes
in the printer.

12:21.950 --> 12:27.038
And this is my signed picture
of Professor Proton.

12:27.122 --> 12:28.623
Do you watch his show?

12:28.707 --> 12:30.667
No. I don't
really like it.

12:31.460 --> 12:32.461
You don't?

12:32.544 --> 12:33.670
I think he's boring.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.215
And he dumbs everything down.

12:37.299 --> 12:40.510
<i>Come on,</i>
Kolinahr, <i>don't fail me now.</i>

12:40.594 --> 12:42.929
And next on the tour,
we have...

12:43.013 --> 12:44.639
a lamp.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.604
This is not
making me feel better.

12:50.687 --> 12:51.855
Their kid is perfect.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.231
And so is ours.

12:53.315 --> 12:55.734
So we're lying to
each other. Fine.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.028
It's just nice to get to know
another family

12:58.111 --> 13:00.447
who's in a similar situation
as us.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.574
And we're still lying.

13:06.745 --> 13:08.038
What grade
are you in?

13:08.121 --> 13:09.790
Eighth.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.541
You?

13:11.625 --> 13:12.918
Tenth.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.002
Cool.

13:15.253 --> 13:17.088
Nobody asked, but fourth.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.301
Why do grownups do this?

13:21.384 --> 13:23.386
They love to stick random kids
together

13:23.470 --> 13:25.263
and expect them
to just be friends.

13:25.347 --> 13:27.474
I know. I hate that.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.725
Fresh Prince is right.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.435
Parents just don't understand.

13:30.519 --> 13:32.270
I love that song.

13:32.354 --> 13:33.522
I have a
cassette of it,

13:33.605 --> 13:35.857
but I recorded it off the radio.

13:35.941 --> 13:37.335
You can hear Sheldon
in the background

13:37.359 --> 13:40.320
saying stuff
about Sir Isaac Neutron.

13:40.403 --> 13:43.323
Ugh, my sister's
always talking about him.

13:43.865 --> 13:45.158
I don't know why.

13:45.242 --> 13:46.576
I think he's dead.

13:47.118 --> 13:48.912
You have no idea
how much it sucks

13:48.995 --> 13:50.455
to have a brother
like him.

13:50.539 --> 13:52.541
Believe it or not,
he's in my class.

13:52.624 --> 13:55.669
My parents sent Paige
to a private school.

13:55.752 --> 13:58.338
Cool. We're too
poor for that.

14:03.260 --> 14:06.596
Does Sheldon
make you feel stupid?

14:06.680 --> 14:08.640
Nah, I'm smart in other ways.

14:08.723 --> 14:10.225
Me, too.

14:10.308 --> 14:11.935
Hey, I saw an old TV
in the alley.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.270
Want to go throw rocks at it?

14:13.353 --> 14:14.311
- Cool!
- Hell yeah!

14:14.312 --> 14:15.564
Let's do it.

14:17.148 --> 14:19.025
We could play traditional chess.

14:19.109 --> 14:21.069
Or if you're interested,
we could play a variant

14:21.152 --> 14:22.612
with a new piece I invented.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.197
That sounds fun.

14:24.281 --> 14:25.866
What's the new piece?

14:25.949 --> 14:27.033
A wizard.

14:27.117 --> 14:28.952
The wizard cannot be taken,
and at any point,

14:29.035 --> 14:32.455
he can teleport and switch
places with any other piece.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.708
Yes, but there's
an obvious flaw.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.711
- What flaw?
- Well, any time anyone is checkmated,

14:37.794 --> 14:40.147
they can simply have the wizard
and their king switch places.

14:40.171 --> 14:42.257
So the game will never end.

14:43.008 --> 14:45.218
I knew that.
You passed my test.

14:46.761 --> 14:48.221
We told Paige
that if she won

14:48.305 --> 14:49.949
the regional spelling bee,
she could get a puppy.

14:49.973 --> 14:51.308
We ended up with two,

14:51.391 --> 14:53.351
'cause she won twice.

14:53.435 --> 14:55.270
Fun! That... that's fun.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.815
All right,
that's enough about Paige.

14:58.899 --> 15:02.110
So, George, I know you're
a football coach.

15:02.193 --> 15:03.403
What about you, Mary?

15:03.486 --> 15:05.447
I work part-time at the church.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.073
- Oh.
- Oh, that's so nice.

15:07.157 --> 15:08.467
I used to work at the
practice with Barry,

15:08.491 --> 15:10.243
but I had to quit
once Paige's schedule

15:10.327 --> 15:11.453
- started to get busy.
- Mm.

15:11.536 --> 15:12.996
Well, that's understandable.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.999
A unique child
can require a lot of attention.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.169
Mm. Try all
the attention. Hmm?

15:19.252 --> 15:21.922
- Okay. You know that's not true, Barry.
- Well...

15:22.005 --> 15:23.423
She's...

15:23.506 --> 15:24.841
she's right. It's not.

15:24.925 --> 15:26.676
Although I did spend
Father's Day alone

15:26.760 --> 15:28.803
'cause she took Paige
to a robotics show.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.889
Okay. That's
enough, Barry.

15:30.972 --> 15:32.474
They don't need
to hear all this.

15:32.557 --> 15:33.558
<i>That's okay.</i>

15:33.642 --> 15:35.393
That's why
we're getting together,

15:35.477 --> 15:37.896
you know, talk about
this kind of stuff.

15:37.979 --> 15:40.732
Barry, it sounds like
you might be feeling left out.

15:40.815 --> 15:42.192
Oh.
No.

15:43.401 --> 15:44.778
Sometimes I do.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.738
And it's not just me.
It's Erica, too.

15:46.821 --> 15:49.282
Oh, now he's just
being dramatic.

15:49.366 --> 15:50.700
Erica gets a lot
of attention,

15:50.784 --> 15:52.827
and she's just a joy.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.915
Dang it, the
screen won't break.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.459
Bet it'll break
if we blow it up.

16:04.422 --> 16:06.383
I love her.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.676
Fine, you're right.

16:07.759 --> 16:08.927
Erica's doing just great.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.054
Nothing to worry about there.

16:14.265 --> 16:16.226
Oh, come on.

16:18.186 --> 16:19.729
You got any matches?

16:19.813 --> 16:21.106
Be right back.

16:26.444 --> 16:29.072
While she's gone,
you want to make out?

16:29.155 --> 16:30.657
Sure.

16:31.449 --> 16:33.743
You actually believe
in the multiverse theory?

16:33.827 --> 16:34.995
Very much so.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.579
It's the most elegant
interpretation

16:36.663 --> 16:38.456
of quantum mechanics.

16:38.540 --> 16:41.960
So you really think there are
an infinite number of universes?

16:42.043 --> 16:44.879
Stephen Hawking believes it,
so, yes, I do.

16:44.963 --> 16:48.591
Well, if there are
an infinite number of universes,

16:48.675 --> 16:50.802
I think that theory's dumb
in all of them.

16:53.304 --> 16:54.681
This is fun.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.200
I don't get to have
discussions like this

16:56.224 --> 16:57.767
with kids at my school.

16:57.851 --> 16:58.852
Do you?

16:59.894 --> 17:01.479
No.

17:08.862 --> 17:11.531
Do you ever wish you were
just like everyone else?

17:13.032 --> 17:14.451
Not at all.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.743
Me neither.

17:15.827 --> 17:18.079
I love being smarter
than everyone.

17:18.621 --> 17:19.873
Me, too.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.750
<i>I started
to think that Paige and I</i>

17:21.833 --> 17:24.085
<i>might have more in common
than I thought.</i>

17:24.169 --> 17:25.252
<i>Maybe my mother was right.</i>

17:25.878 --> 17:28.965
<i>I really did just need
to get to know her better.</i>

17:30.008 --> 17:31.342
Checkmate!

17:31.426 --> 17:32.719
You lose.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.429
<i>Red alert.</i>

17:34.512 --> 17:36.514
<i>Phasers stand by to fire
on my order.</i>

17:36.598 --> 17:39.642
Guess that makes
me the smartest.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.102
<i>I don't know
if ten-year-old Spock</i>

17:41.186 --> 17:42.771
<i>ever flipped a chess board,</i>

17:42.854 --> 17:45.356
<i>but ten-year-old Sheldon
sure did.</i>

17:49.736 --> 17:51.738
<i>You know Paige
always comes first...</i>

17:51.821 --> 17:54.324
Got to say, I'm glad
we invited 'em over.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.701
Don't you get him another beer.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.661
Come on. You love this
and you know it.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.915
They're as messed up as we are.

18:01.998 --> 18:03.833
Fine. But one more
and that's it.

18:05.543 --> 18:07.087
<i>- Whoa!
- Yes!</i>

18:07.170 --> 18:09.380
<i>Holy crap!</i>

18:09.464 --> 18:12.884
Don't you...
Go out there and check!

18:15.261 --> 18:18.640
Now, does anyone know
what happens to quarks

18:18.723 --> 18:22.018
when we combine them
to make mesons and baryons?

18:23.937 --> 18:24.979
Yes, Paige.

18:25.063 --> 18:26.689
We can ignore
the particle masses

18:26.773 --> 18:28.608
at the individual quark level.

18:28.691 --> 18:30.401
Correct.

18:30.485 --> 18:32.695
You are really...

18:34.155 --> 18:36.991
He's jealous of you
paying attention to her.

18:38.743 --> 18:40.453
That was correct, Paige.

18:41.246 --> 18:42.997
And, Sheldon,

18:43.081 --> 18:45.291
is that a new bow tie?

18:46.459 --> 18:47.460
It is.

18:47.544 --> 18:49.045
Lookin' sharp!

18:49.587 --> 18:51.005
Thanks.

18:51.089 --> 18:52.757
That was a close one.

18:52.841 --> 18:54.717
As I was saying,
the only...
