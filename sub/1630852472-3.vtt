01:24.985 --> 01:28.087
Yeah, great catch
on the listing.

01:29.022 --> 01:30.789
It's almost too good to be true.

01:30.791 --> 01:33.392
Yeah, about that.

01:35.061 --> 01:37.896
<i>[Dana] I was working at a

01:37.898 --> 01:39.698
<i>And I really enjoyed it,</i>

01:39.700 --> 01:43.702
so I knew from that moment on
that's what I wanted to do,

01:43.704 --> 01:45.537
and I wanted to open
my own store.

01:45.539 --> 01:46.905
I know you're excited.
Just wait a second.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.841
The realtor will be here
any minute.

01:48.843 --> 01:51.710
I kept thinking, ah, I'll never
be able to afford a business,

01:51.712 --> 01:53.011
um, of my own.

01:53.013 --> 01:55.981
And I came across this one...

01:55.983 --> 01:58.117
It's kinda big, Mama D.

01:58.119 --> 01:58.917
[Dana] Yeah, it is.

01:58.919 --> 02:01.053
One day,
it'll be all yours, kid.

02:02.889 --> 02:07.025
I wanted my place where I can do
whatever I want with it and make it mine

02:07.027 --> 02:08.494
and then give it to my kids.

02:08.496 --> 02:09.962
That was the inspiration.

- Hi.
- This is my wife Milan

02:19.173 --> 02:21.206
- Nice.
- And our daughter Jaidon.

02:21.208 --> 02:24.143
Well, it's lovely to meet
you all. Here's the keys.

02:24.145 --> 02:27.146
Please, go in.
Have a look around.

02:27.148 --> 02:28.814
Won't you be joining us?

02:28.816 --> 02:31.383
Ya know, you guys go in

02:31.385 --> 02:34.153
I'm just gonna wait out here.

No, no, it's just, um...
It's a special place.

02:40.161 --> 02:43.228
I want you all
to enjoy it together.

02:43.230 --> 02:49.034
Keep in mind the seller
is very motivated.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.335
[mouthing]

03:17.897 --> 03:18.530
Wow.

03:19.699 --> 03:22.100
Yeah, wow.

03:22.102 --> 03:27.906
<i>The condition of the building was
like whoever had owned the building</i>

03:27.908 --> 03:32.978
before it had skipped town
and took everything with them.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.914
<i>It was in complete disarray.</i>

03:35.916 --> 03:39.851
It looked dark. It didn't
have the best feeling.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.187
Ya know,
and I was just walking in,

03:42.189 --> 03:44.856
and I'm like,
"this is not normal."

03:44.858 --> 03:45.624
<i>It's not normal.</i>

03:45.626 --> 03:49.394
Mama D, what was this place?

03:51.130 --> 03:56.301
The listing on the ad was an old
funeral home complete with crematoria.

03:56.303 --> 03:57.536
A funeral home.

03:58.705 --> 04:00.205
A funeral home?

04:00.207 --> 04:02.908
You mean, like,
with dead people in it?

04:02.910 --> 04:05.210
Who buys a house
with dead people in it?

04:05.212 --> 04:07.145
They're not here anymore.

04:07.147 --> 04:08.280
It'll be great.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.215
Dana, come on, really?

04:10.217 --> 04:11.416
This place is a mess.

04:12.218 --> 04:13.919
Yeah.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.988
It means we'll get it
even cheaper.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.536
<i>[narrator] Dana quickly closes
the deal</i>

04:31.538 --> 04:35.841
<i>and becomes the new owner of

04:35.843 --> 04:39.745
<i>and one not entirely empty
of inhabitants.</i>

04:39.747 --> 04:41.379
Looks good, huh?

04:41.948 --> 04:44.249
<i>[Dana] I felt like I was never gonna
get through with cleaning up the building.</i>

04:44.251 --> 04:46.285
It's just so big.

04:46.287 --> 04:47.986
And there's so much work to do.

04:47.988 --> 04:52.291
<i>And the biggest part to clean
was in the crematorium area.</i>

04:53.126 --> 04:54.893
[sneezes]

04:54.895 --> 04:56.528
- [girl whispers] Bless you.
- Uh, thanks.

05:05.705 --> 05:08.740
<i>[Dana] From a very young age,
we've always had stuff happening.</i>

05:08.742 --> 05:11.343
My mother is very sensitive
to things.

05:11.345 --> 05:14.112
And she sees
things and hears things.

05:28.661 --> 05:29.761
Okay.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.763
I don't mind if we have
good spirits hanging around.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.966
I don't want anything evil
hanging around.

05:38.871 --> 05:42.541
<i>[narrator] Determined to have the
costume shop ready for its grand opening,</i>

05:42.543 --> 05:46.011

<i>She recruits friends, family, and former
employees to speed up the process.</i>

05:52.119 --> 05:57.522
<i>But the building won't let her
forget its past so easily.</i>

05:57.524 --> 05:59.458
You can go ahead
and take this box out too.

06:01.561 --> 06:05.030
Dumpster's practically full,
and also we need packing tape.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.099
So I'm just gonna run and
get some after I toss these.

06:07.101 --> 06:09.468
- Okay. Thank you.
- No problem.

06:16.809 --> 06:18.176
This is the weirdest place.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.912
You can tell this was the
old front of the building,

06:20.914 --> 06:23.281
and the retail space
was a later add on.

06:23.850 --> 06:26.284
Shutters over
bricked up windows.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.954
- I thought I'd seen everything.
- Yeah, right.

06:35.528 --> 06:36.895
Oh, my God!

06:36.897 --> 06:37.963
What is it?

06:39.799 --> 06:41.400
Funeral No. 7.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.204
They're human remains.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.073
What? You're kidding.

06:50.777 --> 06:52.344
What should we do with it?

06:54.046 --> 06:56.314
Well, we can't
just throw it away.

06:56.316 --> 06:58.817
This is a person.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.385
It's somebody's loved one.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.489
It's downright creepy.

07:04.491 --> 07:05.957
Yeah.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.693
I didn't know what to do
with it, so I just set it aside.

07:08.695 --> 07:11.296
And we were gonna deal with it
at a later time.

07:15.601 --> 07:19.037
<i>[narrator] As Dana and Milan

07:19.039 --> 07:22.340

about the building.</i>

07:22.342 --> 07:23.442
What are you doing?

07:25.144 --> 07:26.478
This was
the embalming room, right?

07:27.380 --> 07:29.147
Yeah, so?

07:30.383 --> 07:31.550
There's no drain

07:33.019 --> 07:34.953

07:34.955 --> 07:38.323
Oh, I don't even want to know.

07:38.991 --> 07:42.427
Oh, please tell me
that's not what I think it is.

07:43.529 --> 07:46.131
<i>[Dana] There was a blood stain

07:46.133 --> 07:48.133
And I was really concerned
about that

07:48.135 --> 07:51.036
and how we were gonna clean
that up.

07:51.038 --> 07:53.538
Guess I know what I'm doing
for the next hour.

07:55.007 --> 07:57.809

class at the university,

07:57.811 --> 08:00.011

08:00.013 --> 08:01.112
Sorry, I can't help.

08:01.114 --> 08:02.314
No worries.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.549
I'll see you when you get home.

08:06.085 --> 08:07.919
Clare'll be here soon anyways.

08:07.921 --> 08:08.987
Okay.

08:17.430 --> 08:18.864
Dammit.

08:18.866 --> 08:22.534
<i>I took four different chemicals
and sprayed it on the blood,</i>

08:22.536 --> 08:25.070
hoping I was getting
the blood stain up.

08:25.905 --> 08:28.039
It's filthy caked on.

08:30.843 --> 08:33.044
<i>[Dana] As it started coming up,</i>

08:33.946 --> 08:36.281
<i>it started foaming
all the blood up.</i>

08:38.384 --> 08:39.985
And I started crying.

08:40.820 --> 08:42.554
Get a grip, Dana.

08:47.894 --> 08:50.996
<i>I felt just such a sadness...</i>

08:50.998 --> 08:52.464

where it came from.

What the hell is wrong with me?

09:06.646 --> 09:08.213
Who is there?

09:09.282 --> 09:13.151
And then, I heard the sobbing
in the room.

Yeah.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.045
Yeah, uh.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.114
This is gonna
sound crazy, Clare,

11:56.116 --> 11:59.250
but I heard a voice
coming from the storage room.

12:01.987 --> 12:03.354
Can I show you something?

[narrator] <i>Dana's employee

What is that?

12:16.103 --> 12:18.737
This is a spirit box.

12:18.739 --> 12:21.539
It's basically
a ghostly audio receiver.

12:21.541 --> 12:24.075
And you get answers
in real time.

12:25.077 --> 12:27.846
Once I get it turned on,
you can ask a question.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.147
Okay.

12:29.982 --> 12:32.383
I was thinking
about painting in here.

12:33.285 --> 12:35.553
What color would you like me
to paint the room?

12:35.555 --> 12:37.088
[radio static playing]

12:39.258 --> 12:44.129
Ah, I've been feeling a lot

How many spirits are here?

<i>[Dana] And we were taken
aback by it.</i>

12:58.111 --> 13:03.348
And then you hear another voice
out loud, a disembodied voice, say...

13:03.350 --> 13:05.116
[woman] There's more than that.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.954
You must have heard that.

13:09.956 --> 13:13.658
There was nobody else in the
building that could have said this.

13:13.660 --> 13:15.260
Clare,

13:15.262 --> 13:17.896
this building is made
of cinder blocks.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.931
There's no way we could hear
anybody from the outside.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.200
And we're the only people
in this building.

13:24.270 --> 13:27.539
Do you have any messages for us?

13:29.875 --> 13:30.608

Oh, no, no, no,
I'm not a customer.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.853
I have a lot
of questions about this space.

14:14.855 --> 14:19.257
Like, why the embalming room
doesn't have a drain in the floor.

14:19.259 --> 14:23.294
Well, we used to use the
adjacent bathroom sink for that.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.863
Ew.

14:24.865 --> 14:25.997
That sounds

14:26.832 --> 14:28.333
cumbersome.

14:28.335 --> 14:30.702
Never got any complaints
from the prisoners.

14:30.704 --> 14:31.936
Excuse me?

14:31.938 --> 14:35.139
Oh, the funeral home
had a contract with the prison

14:35.141 --> 14:37.542
over by the interstate.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.878
Well, this just keeps getting
better and better.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.512
Would you mind showing
me around?

14:41.514 --> 14:44.549
Yeah, sure, um, come on.
This way.

14:46.218 --> 14:49.220
So this was three viewing rooms.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.256
And we had them with dividers.

14:51.258 --> 14:55.026
<i>[Dana] I was worried if they were
bad in life are they bad in death.</i>

14:55.028 --> 14:55.993
Okay.

14:55.995 --> 14:58.029
<i>It made me start
questioning things.</i>

14:58.031 --> 14:59.864
- Could you help me out with something?
- Sure.

14:59.866 --> 15:02.767
And then I started thinking, "Oh, my
gosh, I still have these ashes back here."

15:02.769 --> 15:04.702
I didn't wanna just throw
them away.

15:04.704 --> 15:08.106
Is there any way you could
take them somewhere?

15:08.108 --> 15:12.076
Maybe this is causing so much
of the paranormal activity,

15:12.078 --> 15:14.412
the crying, everything
that's going on.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.915
Yeah, I could take them
to the coroners for you.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.584
[sighs] That would be great.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.787
-Thanks so much. Uh, they're back this way.
-Okay.

15:22.789 --> 15:26.891
I thought, well, that's done.
I wipe my hands of this.

15:26.893 --> 15:31.062
And things will be a little
more positive in here and calm.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.031
But that wasn't the case.

15:35.134 --> 15:38.136
<i>[narrator] The grand opening
has finally arrived.</i>

15:38.138 --> 15:40.738
<i>Dana has christened the shop,</i>

15:40.740 --> 15:43.508
<i>Daydreams and Nightmares.</i>

15:44.877 --> 15:47.178
- Bye, thank you.
- We love your store.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.513
[chuckles softly] Thanks.

15:50.082 --> 15:51.582
That was a great night.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.718
They sure were hungry.

15:53.720 --> 15:58.990
Myself, Dana, Jaidon,
employees were there and...

15:59.892 --> 16:02.160
<i>everything was working
quite well.</i>

16:02.162 --> 16:05.697
<i>We were open for business
and it looked great.</i>

16:05.699 --> 16:08.066
We tried to hide
as much remnants as we could.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.401
That it was a former
funeral home.

16:20.579 --> 16:22.613
<i>[narrator] After opening day,</i>

16:22.615 --> 16:28.152
<i>Dana sends everyone home and
stays to finish the shop's receipts.</i>

16:28.154 --> 16:30.722
<i>[Dana] I was doing paperwork
in my office.</i>

16:30.724 --> 16:32.991
And I just had
my office light on in there,

16:32.993 --> 16:36.761
because I didn't wanna
waste any electricity.

16:36.763 --> 16:39.330
<i>And I had this strong feeling
that I wasn't alone.</i>

16:44.937 --> 16:46.237
[intense music playing]

16:51.977 --> 16:53.244
Hello?

16:54.780 --> 16:55.980
Who's there?

16:57.049 --> 16:59.150
So, I got up from my desk.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.455
<i>And I took a picture...</i>

17:05.224 --> 17:06.491
[camera shutter clicking]

17:11.030 --> 17:12.430
If someone's there...

17:13.298 --> 17:15.299
I'll call the police.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.535
[breathing heavily]

17:20.239 --> 17:23.174
The first picture I don't see
anything but the second one...

17:24.009 --> 17:26.010
What the...

17:27.913 --> 17:30.048
<i>[narrator] Dana Walters

17:30.050 --> 17:32.050
<i>by what she believes

17:32.052 --> 17:34.452
<i>But after taking a photograph...</i>

17:34.454 --> 17:37.422
<i>she's uncertain
if it is of this world</i>

17:37.890 --> 17:39.857
<i>or the next.</i>

17:39.859 --> 17:43.594
<i>[Dana] The second one you see a

<i>You can see his white shirt,
you can see everything and...</i>

17:48.267 --> 17:49.967
<i>I freaked out.</i>

17:49.969 --> 17:51.269
<i>It scared me to death.</i>

17:51.271 --> 17:53.004
If anybody's there...

17:53.872 --> 17:55.039
you better leave.

17:55.041 --> 17:56.441
Now!

17:57.876 --> 17:59.210
[breathing heavily]

18:09.154 --> 18:11.089
[breath trembling]

18:16.361 --> 18:18.029
[eerie music playing]

18:32.945 --> 18:34.479
And I left.

18:36.882 --> 18:38.916
[breathing heavily]

18:38.918 --> 18:41.452
I was like, "I'm gone.
I'm out of here tonight."

18:51.130 --> 18:55.133
<i>[narrator] Concerned about

<i>Who is also fascinated

You almost ready
to go, Mishelle?

19:06.946 --> 19:09.180
<i>[Mishelle] My mom's supposed
to pick me up here in a few.</i>

19:09.182 --> 19:10.314
Yeah.

But...

19:13.553 --> 19:15.253
Come here for a second.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.889
You may wanna wait
before you leave.

19:17.891 --> 19:19.991
Check out the security cameras.

19:21.126 --> 19:23.194
[eerie music playing]

19:31.837 --> 19:33.971
This is where
you get to see this.

19:33.973 --> 19:36.507
Those are orbs.

19:37.943 --> 19:39.977
- What?
- [chuckles softly]

19:39.979 --> 19:42.947
<i>[Mishelle] An orb is just
a ball of energy</i>

19:43.148 --> 19:45.983
<i>of someone's spirit.</i>

19:47.853 --> 19:51.022
This is an apparition
that we're watching.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.423
Right in front of my eyes.

19:57.329 --> 19:58.763
Looks like the coast is clear.

19:58.765 --> 20:01.265
- Come on, let's hurry up and get out of here.
- Okay.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.312
Hold on. Let me set
the alarm really quick.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.047
[beeping]

20:19.117 --> 20:20.451
[intense music playing]

20:22.921 --> 20:24.055
You didn't do that...

20:24.256 --> 20:25.423
did you?

20:26.091 --> 20:28.426
But I...
I felt it too.

20:29.161 --> 20:31.128
Some other something
doesn't want us here.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.097
Mishelle and I looked
at each other, we're like,

20:33.099 --> 20:34.799
"Oh, it's definitely
time to leave."

20:34.801 --> 20:37.001
You don't have
to tell me twice to go.

20:40.205 --> 20:43.174
Do you want me to wait
with you until Milan arrives?

20:43.176 --> 20:45.910
- No, thanks, I'm fine. Yeah.
- You sure?

20:45.912 --> 20:47.311
Okay.

20:54.019 --> 20:55.453
There's nothing out here.

20:57.189 --> 20:59.090
Be damned.

21:01.827 --> 21:03.928
- Oh...
- [chuckles] It's just me.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.564
- You scared me.
- Sorry.

21:06.566 --> 21:07.932
[cell phone ringing]

21:08.767 --> 21:10.868
What is that?

21:10.870 --> 21:13.237
The security alarm just went
off inside the shop.

21:14.339 --> 21:15.673
[Milan] Someone tripped it?

21:15.675 --> 21:17.441
No, I just locked up.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.448
[Milan] That's what's going on
inside the store?

21:25.851 --> 21:27.551
What are those?

21:28.820 --> 21:32.957
<i>[Dana] You can see these orbs
flying all over,</i>

21:33.725 --> 21:38.162
and dust and bugs can't go
through glass display cabinets.

21:38.164 --> 21:41.198
And you can see them enter
the glass display cabinets

21:41.200 --> 21:43.167
and come out on the other side.

21:43.169 --> 21:45.936
It's going right through
the display case.

21:50.208 --> 21:51.976
[Dana] According to Mishelle,

21:52.511 --> 21:54.945
they're spirits.

21:54.947 --> 21:58.949
We saw with our own eyes right
there looking at our surveillance monitor.

22:02.587 --> 22:04.055
That-- that's scary.

22:04.057 --> 22:06.991
That's scary, 'cause
you're like, "Who is that?"

22:07.059 --> 22:08.259
<i>I start thinking,</i>

22:08.261 --> 22:11.295
<i>"Which of the 92 spirits
is this that's coming in?"</i>

22:11.297 --> 22:12.430
[scoffs]

22:13.732 --> 22:15.466
Wha...

22:17.069 --> 22:21.172
<i>[narrator] While the existence of the
spirits in the shop is now fairly certain.</i>

22:21.174 --> 22:24.809
<i>What they want
is still in question.</i>

22:24.811 --> 22:29.814
<i>Dana has an idea of who may
be able to help unravel the mystery</i>

22:29.816 --> 22:31.482
<i>in the storage room.</i>

22:31.484 --> 22:34.051
So you want me to do what now?

22:34.953 --> 22:37.555
I think there's a young woman
here that needs your help.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.190
She sounds about your age.

22:39.192 --> 22:41.659
So, I was hoping
she would respond to you.

22:41.661 --> 22:44.528
She just seemed so young,

22:44.530 --> 22:48.399
so innocent and just needed
someone to talk to,

22:48.401 --> 22:50.868
and-- I mean, we wanted answers.

22:50.870 --> 22:54.038
<i>And with Jaidon being young, I thought,
"Well, maybe there will be a connection."</i>

22:54.040 --> 22:55.339
Come on, please.

22:55.774 --> 22:58.042
Just give it a shot.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.510
If it doesn't work,
there's no harm done.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.049
Uh, hey...

23:06.084 --> 23:11.021
I'm here, so, if you're here,
say hello?

23:14.292 --> 23:16.427
Momma Dee,
this is not gonna work.

23:17.195 --> 23:18.496
<i>[woman] Hi.</i>

23:20.565 --> 23:22.233
Wait. Wait. Wait.

23:23.902 --> 23:25.102
Ask her, her name.

23:27.139 --> 23:28.239
Uh...

23:29.174 --> 23:30.975
What's your name?

23:31.710 --> 23:33.310
<i>[woman] Angie.</i>

23:34.880 --> 23:39.316
And she responded
with her name of Angie.

23:39.751 --> 23:43.087
And she was 14.

23:43.089 --> 23:47.291
You could tell Angie's voice
just kind of changed a little bit,

23:47.293 --> 23:50.895
and it was like, "Finally, I have a
connection with someone I can talk to."

23:50.897 --> 23:53.130
Angie. Hi.

23:53.865 --> 23:55.166
I'm Jaidon.

23:56.768 --> 23:58.068
Tell me about yourself.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.872
<i>[Jaidon] She was a prostitute.</i>

24:01.874 --> 24:04.208
And she had a child.

24:04.843 --> 24:06.343
That she was pregnant with.

24:07.345 --> 24:09.980
<i>It was really bad
what happened to her.</i>

24:10.982 --> 24:16.754
<i>She had told us that these men
locked in her a closet,</i>

24:16.756 --> 24:21.492
and they would take her out
and rape her and put her back.

24:26.198 --> 24:27.531
<i>[Angie] He's coming.</i>

24:28.567 --> 24:29.800
Wait! Who's coming?

24:29.802 --> 24:32.169
Wait, Angie!

24:34.873 --> 24:37.374
<i>[narrator] After making contact
with the voice in the storage room.</i>

24:37.376 --> 24:41.812
<i>Jaidon is frantic
not to lose the connection.</i>

24:41.814 --> 24:43.347
<i>[Angie] I have
to get out of here.</i>

24:44.149 --> 24:45.683
<i>He's coming.</i>

24:45.685 --> 24:49.019
Wait. Who's coming?
Wait, Angie!

24:53.959 --> 24:57.461
<i>[Angie] Please,
don't leave me, Jaidon.</i>

24:58.964 --> 25:00.931
<i>Take me with you.</i>

25:00.933 --> 25:03.033
[sobbing] I'm sorry.

25:06.538 --> 25:08.539
I can't do that, Angie.

25:08.541 --> 25:10.207
<i>[Jaidon] When I was about
to leave,</i>

25:10.209 --> 25:12.309
I heard clear as day.

25:12.878 --> 25:14.144
"Don't leave me here."

25:14.346 --> 25:15.913
"Don't leave me here."

25:15.915 --> 25:18.082
"Can I go with you?"

25:18.084 --> 25:20.684
And I had to cry,
I literally cried

25:20.686 --> 25:21.886
and I told her no.

25:21.888 --> 25:23.988
I told her,
"No, you can't come with me."

25:25.056 --> 25:27.324
<i>It was heartbreaking for me.</i>

25:27.326 --> 25:29.527
I'm so sorry.

25:34.900 --> 25:36.433
<i>[Angie] He's here!</i>

25:38.003 --> 25:41.639
I was pretty scared
at what I heard. but...

25:41.641 --> 25:44.074
all of a sudden, I felt like
a pain on my hand.

25:44.076 --> 25:47.278
I think whatever Angie
was afraid of got me.

25:57.689 --> 26:01.792
<i>[narrator] Concerned about who
or what drove Angie away,</i>

26:01.794 --> 26:05.896
<i>Dana gives her employee,
Mishelle to investigate e further.</i>

26:05.898 --> 26:07.731
<i>Not wanting to go at alone,</i>

26:07.733 --> 26:11.101
<i>she drags a reluctant
Milan along.</i>

26:11.103 --> 26:14.171
This is the room they drained
the fluids from the embalming room.

26:19.878 --> 26:22.146
[Milan] I can't believe you
talked me into coming back here.

26:24.015 --> 26:25.549
But if it helps...

26:29.087 --> 26:33.924
The bathroom was very heavy
and almost cold.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.225
Take a seat.

26:35.860 --> 26:37.595
<i>[Mishelle] So we went in,</i>

26:37.597 --> 26:41.532
<i>and we're getting ready
to ask questions.</i>

26:41.534 --> 26:46.437
When we turned off the light, I could
actually see her sitting across from me.

26:47.138 --> 26:49.406
But something wasn't right.

26:51.042 --> 26:52.910
I don't like this.

26:52.912 --> 26:55.546
Yeah, definitely
has creepy vibes.

26:56.715 --> 26:58.182
From what I've heard,

26:58.184 --> 27:00.985
when two mirrors are facing
each other like this,

27:02.053 --> 27:03.387
it can open a portal.

27:03.888 --> 27:05.222
A doorway

27:05.690 --> 27:07.091
to another dimension.

27:08.093 --> 27:10.294
I don't know
if I buy into all that.

27:10.296 --> 27:13.197
But I can feel the hairs
in my arms standing up.

27:16.868 --> 27:18.235
Let's just see what happens.

27:18.237 --> 27:19.536
Okay.

27:22.307 --> 27:23.474
Ready?

27:29.381 --> 27:31.382
Who are you?

27:34.953 --> 27:36.420
What do you want?

27:38.857 --> 27:40.624
It started getting really dark.

27:40.626 --> 27:43.427
Really, really dark.
I couldn't see her anymore.

27:44.996 --> 27:49.033
<i>And I just felt like this
heaviness just come over me.</i>

27:49.567 --> 27:51.001
[breathing heavily]

27:51.003 --> 27:55.906
And I was having a hard time
breathing, I was just like...

27:55.908 --> 27:59.076
I was just panicking. I don't
know what was happening.

27:59.078 --> 28:00.477
[breathing heavily]

28:01.012 --> 28:02.446
Oh, my God!

28:06.284 --> 28:07.484
[breath trembling]

28:08.119 --> 28:09.420
Mishelle!

28:10.355 --> 28:13.257
Whatever you do,
don't look behind you.

28:16.795 --> 28:18.462
What do you want?

28:19.898 --> 28:21.365
<i>[narrator] In an attempt
to call out</i>

28:21.367 --> 28:23.934
<i>the aggressive spirit
haunting the costume shop...</i>

28:23.936 --> 28:25.269
Oh, my God!

28:25.271 --> 28:28.672
<i>[narrator] employee and
paranormal enthusiast, Mishelle</i>

28:28.674 --> 28:30.808
<i>investigates with Milan.</i>

28:30.810 --> 28:32.776
- Mishelle!
<i>- [narrator] But they are not prepared</i>

28:32.778 --> 28:33.911
<i>for the reply.</i>

28:33.913 --> 28:36.447
Whatever you do,
don't look behind you.

28:38.616 --> 28:40.517
[breathing heavily]

28:40.519 --> 28:43.921
The feeling I got of this
thing just hovering like,

28:43.923 --> 28:46.356
it was almost eight foot tall.

28:47.959 --> 28:50.094
<i>Like just leaning over me.</i>

28:51.863 --> 28:53.864
And I thought
if I sat there any longer,

28:53.866 --> 28:55.799
it was just going to

28:55.801 --> 28:57.401
<i>just cover me like a blanket.</i>

28:58.803 --> 29:00.270
<i>I couldn't breathe.</i>

29:00.272 --> 29:02.773
<i>I was like, "Is it gonna take
my breath away?"</i>

29:02.775 --> 29:04.208
<i>"Is it gonna take me?"</i>

29:05.376 --> 29:08.278
I just-- I was scared.
I was so scared.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.980
[Mishelle screaming]

29:11.716 --> 29:13.984
Oh, my God! Mishelle!

29:16.087 --> 29:18.388
- [door opens]
- [both coughing]

29:18.957 --> 29:20.257
[breathing heavily]

29:23.728 --> 29:25.362
<i>[Milan] It-- it scared me.</i>

29:26.698 --> 29:29.199
<i>And I was scared for her.</i>

29:29.201 --> 29:31.401
I-I tried
to ease my fears, but...

29:32.003 --> 29:32.870
I know what I saw.

29:32.872 --> 29:35.472
Dana, something happened.

29:36.474 --> 29:39.209
I know I had to do something.
I had to get some help.

29:44.115 --> 29:48.485
<i>[narrator] Dana calls spiritualist
minister Gaylene Cornell.</i>

29:49.554 --> 29:51.155
Hello, Gaylene Cornell.

29:51.157 --> 29:54.458
Hi. My name is Dana Walters.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.994
And I own a shop
here in Modesto.

29:57.862 --> 30:00.564
<i>I've been having
some issues and...</i>

30:00.566 --> 30:03.167
I was-- I was hoping
you could help me.

30:03.169 --> 30:06.403
One of my employees
had heard of Gaylene

30:06.405 --> 30:07.971
<i>and told me about her.</i>

30:08.173 --> 30:09.239
Okay.

30:09.241 --> 30:10.941
I've always been psychic.

30:10.943 --> 30:12.042
I've always been a medium.

30:12.044 --> 30:15.479
I don't remember never
having these abilities. Ever.

30:15.481 --> 30:18.315
This is gonna sound
really strange, but...

30:19.284 --> 30:22.186
<i>- the shop used to be--
- Why do I smell burning flesh?</i>

30:24.956 --> 30:26.390
There was a crematorium.

30:26.958 --> 30:28.292
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

30:28.726 --> 30:30.160
How did you know that?

30:33.231 --> 30:36.166
I've been having dreams about
this place, Dana.

30:37.035 --> 30:39.203
Bad dreams.

30:39.205 --> 30:41.371
<i>[Dana] Gaylene has never been
to my shop.</i>

30:41.373 --> 30:44.107
And she started telling me...

30:44.576 --> 30:46.009
room by room,

30:46.011 --> 30:48.912
what my shop was, what it
looked like, how it was laid out,

30:48.914 --> 30:51.048
and there's-- there was
no video at that time.

30:51.050 --> 30:52.482
There was nothing out there

30:52.484 --> 30:53.817
that showed what it looked like.

30:53.819 --> 30:56.987
And for her to describe the
things, I was blown away already.

30:58.623 --> 31:01.859
<i>[narrator] Gaylene agrees
to come assist Dana.</i>

31:01.861 --> 31:05.529
<i>She reveals that she picked up
on a large number of spirits</i>

31:05.531 --> 31:07.030
<i>inhabiting the building.</i>

31:07.032 --> 31:11.034
<i>Some of which are dangerous.</i>

31:11.036 --> 31:13.837
They call it gut instinct.
They call it mother's instinct,

31:13.839 --> 31:14.872
gut feeling.

31:14.874 --> 31:16.073
I just know.

31:16.075 --> 31:17.941
Gaylene, welcome.

31:17.943 --> 31:20.978
- Thank you so much for coming.
- It's my pleasure.

31:22.080 --> 31:25.616
[Dana] Uh, this is Mishelle.
She works here.

31:25.618 --> 31:28.385
[Dana] Can we get you--

31:28.387 --> 31:31.788
<i>[Gaylene] A psychic is somebody who
can know what happened in the past.</i>

31:31.790 --> 31:33.924
<i>Know what's happening
in the future.</i>

31:33.926 --> 31:37.928
And a medium is somebody who
actually communicates with the dead.

31:37.930 --> 31:38.762
<i>And I'm both.</i>

31:38.764 --> 31:40.130
I know this one.

31:41.666 --> 31:44.534
I've encountered him before.

31:44.536 --> 31:49.806
I can see spirit, but I don't see
them as clearly as I hear them.

31:49.808 --> 31:52.109
I hear them like
they're just people.

31:53.311 --> 31:54.778
He's a Soulkeeper.

31:54.780 --> 31:59.917
A spirit who is bad in life
and bad in death.

31:59.919 --> 32:03.487
<i>[Dana] Gaylene told me we had a
spirit there that she calls a "Soulkeeper."</i>

32:04.822 --> 32:08.025
And he doesn't let
the spirits leave.

32:08.027 --> 32:10.193
He's highly intelligent.

32:11.095 --> 32:12.029
And cruel.

32:12.031 --> 32:13.797
Why is he here?

32:13.799 --> 32:15.899
[Dana] The Soulkeeper wants
to keep everybody there.

32:15.901 --> 32:17.901
He's in control.
He's the boss.

32:17.903 --> 32:21.371
He feeds on the fear
and pain of others.

32:21.373 --> 32:25.142
He's gotten darker and stronger
as he's collected other souls.

32:25.144 --> 32:26.777
Collected souls?

32:26.779 --> 32:28.445
More like he's trapped them.

32:29.013 --> 32:32.783
He makes them feel
they have no choice.

32:32.785 --> 32:36.086
[Gaylene] I've felt so many
different types of spirits.

32:36.088 --> 32:38.388
There were spirits
that were just lost.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.357
<i>There were children.</i>

32:40.925 --> 32:42.726
<i>There were adults.</i>

32:42.728 --> 32:47.230
And it was so many
different levels of time periods.

32:47.232 --> 32:50.067
<i>It wasn't just all in the 1990s.</i>

32:50.069 --> 32:53.370
It was clear back
in the late 1800s.

32:54.272 --> 32:56.406
He knows I've come to help them.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.408
And he's not happy about it.

33:00.878 --> 33:01.912
Are you?

33:01.914 --> 33:04.081
[screaming noise]

33:06.985 --> 33:08.485
I'm feeling drawn.
Follow me.

33:12.657 --> 33:15.559
<i>[narrator] Gaylene is drawn
to the storage room</i>

33:15.561 --> 33:18.128
<i>where Jaidon made contact
with Angie.</i>

33:18.130 --> 33:19.830
[whispering noises]

33:19.832 --> 33:21.331
There's no need to fear.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.800
[voice speaking faintly]
<i>Please help me.</i>

33:23.802 --> 33:25.168
I'm here to help you.

33:25.170 --> 33:27.404
[voice speaking faintly]
<i>Help.</i>

33:33.044 --> 33:35.512
[whispering noises fades away]

33:36.581 --> 33:37.814
[shutters rattling]

33:37.816 --> 33:41.518
[Gaylene] When the shutters
start to shake and rattle,

33:41.520 --> 33:45.022
I know that it's the Soulkeeper
because he has a certain energy.

33:45.523 --> 33:48.291
<i>An energy that is indescribable.</i>

33:48.293 --> 33:50.961
Its big, its huge, its negative.

33:50.963 --> 33:53.830
And it is trying to scare me.

33:53.832 --> 33:56.566
- [shutters rattling]
- He's trying to scare us off.

33:57.935 --> 33:59.369
But we won't be deterred.

34:00.071 --> 34:01.204
Will we?

34:01.206 --> 34:05.075
[Gaylene] Soulkeeper's
main purpose is to get me out

34:05.077 --> 34:09.179
'cause he knows I have one
purpose and that's to get him out.

34:09.181 --> 34:10.547
[shutter rattling stops]

34:11.949 --> 34:14.051
- [EMF meter crackling]
- Do you see someone?

34:16.854 --> 34:18.021
[Gaylene] Yes.

34:19.190 --> 34:21.124
A young Black woman.

34:22.894 --> 34:26.029
Looks like she's from the 1940s.

34:29.834 --> 34:33.403
- She says she was forced into prostitution.
- [woman crying echoes]

34:35.039 --> 34:37.174
She's telling me...

34:37.176 --> 34:39.376
when she found herself pregnant,

34:39.378 --> 34:42.212
she was made
to have a back-alley abortion.

34:47.185 --> 34:48.952
It was fatal.

34:49.454 --> 34:50.987
[Gaylene]
<i>And I've never come across</i>

34:50.989 --> 34:52.422
anything like that.

34:53.925 --> 34:57.661
It's very sad.
Devastatingly sad.

34:57.663 --> 35:02.866
[panting] Why...
Why is she still here?

35:02.868 --> 35:07.304
[Gaylene] She fears crossing over and being
judged because of how she led her life.

35:08.139 --> 35:11.041
But it wasn't her fault.

35:11.043 --> 35:14.277
Where she's going,
there's only love.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.080
Love and understanding.

35:18.182 --> 35:19.316
Oh, my God.

35:19.318 --> 35:20.851
What does that mean?

35:20.853 --> 35:22.352
[Gaylene sighs]

35:23.121 --> 35:26.356
It means her soul has moved
beyond this room.

35:27.024 --> 35:29.993
I hope she's crossed over
and found peace.

35:31.229 --> 35:33.363
- [loud thud]
- I'm being drawn.

35:50.882 --> 35:52.115
[loud raspy breathing noise]

35:53.050 --> 35:54.918
[Gaylene]
<i>When I first walked in,</i>

35:54.920 --> 35:57.354
I was almost shoved
out of the room.

35:57.356 --> 36:01.024
It was an actual
physical feeling.

36:02.059 --> 36:03.393
[Gaylene] The mirrors.

36:04.562 --> 36:07.264
Its creating a portal.

36:07.266 --> 36:11.067
[Gaylene] When I get close to a
portal, anywhere, and they're all over,

36:11.069 --> 36:15.071
<i>it's like a whirling,
swirling vortex</i>

36:15.073 --> 36:18.108
of just their negativity.

36:18.110 --> 36:21.711
<i>[narrator] Gaylene hears
spirits calling out to her.</i>

36:21.713 --> 36:23.246
You are not trapped.

36:23.248 --> 36:25.549
You are free to go to the light.

36:26.417 --> 36:29.019
No one can force you to stay.

36:30.121 --> 36:30.820
If any--

36:30.822 --> 36:32.288
Ow!

36:38.062 --> 36:41.831
<i>[Gaylene] When you get scratched
and there's three scratches,</i>

36:41.833 --> 36:45.068
it depends on your belief
system, if you are Christian,

36:45.070 --> 36:49.439
it's making a mockery of the
Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

36:50.474 --> 36:54.711
<i>For somebody who maybe Pagan
or another type of religion,</i>

36:54.713 --> 37:01.851
it is making a mockery of the divine
creator and gods and goddesses.

37:01.853 --> 37:05.956
So, it's all the same. It's
still the power of the trinity.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.261
[rattling]

37:12.029 --> 37:14.064
[Dana panting]
Gaylene, what's going on?

37:14.066 --> 37:15.899
The Soulkeeper.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.068
He's gotten too dark
and too powerful.

37:18.070 --> 37:21.104
He's keeping other spirits
from passing over.

37:21.106 --> 37:25.108
He gets stronger with
every soul that he traps.

37:25.110 --> 37:27.310
- [Mishelle panting]
- [woman screaming echoes]

37:27.312 --> 37:29.212
He's drawing power
from their pain.

37:29.214 --> 37:30.680
[woman screaming in pain]

37:30.682 --> 37:33.283
[Gaylene] I can close the
negative energy here if you want.

37:33.285 --> 37:36.219
You must decide
what you can live with.

37:37.388 --> 37:39.689
<i>[Gaylene] I would prefer
that they all go,</i>

37:39.691 --> 37:41.358
<i>but that's not my choice.</i>

37:42.026 --> 37:44.761
I think they should
go on the other side

37:44.763 --> 37:46.863
because that's where
they're supposed to be.

37:46.865 --> 37:48.298
They don't belong
on earth anymore.

37:49.033 --> 37:50.166
[panting]

37:50.801 --> 37:52.802
He's gotten too dangerous, Dana.

37:52.804 --> 37:54.504
We have to get him out of here.

37:54.506 --> 37:57.107
But he's not going to go
without a fight!

37:59.744 --> 38:01.645
<i>[narrator] A spiritualist
minister, Gaylene Cornell,</i>

38:01.647 --> 38:04.781
<i>works to rid the costume shop
of its dangerous entities.</i>

38:04.783 --> 38:07.050
[Gaylene] But he's not going
to go without a fight!

38:07.052 --> 38:11.087
<i>[narrator] She knows that any
sign of weakness from her part</i>

38:11.089 --> 38:14.357
<i>will only encourage
the Soulkeeper.</i>

38:21.699 --> 38:23.199
Go into the light!

38:24.602 --> 38:29.139
Go into the light.
You have free will.

38:29.141 --> 38:31.875
<i>[Gaylene] I needed to go in
without fear.</i>

38:31.877 --> 38:34.044
I needed to go in as a warrior.

38:34.046 --> 38:36.279
And that's how I went in.

38:36.281 --> 38:38.982
Go into the light!

38:39.717 --> 38:41.251
[rattling]

38:42.353 --> 38:46.256
You will release these souls!

38:47.158 --> 38:48.091
[Gaylene grunts]

38:48.093 --> 38:49.359
[Mishelle panting]

38:51.295 --> 38:53.096
- [loud thud]
- [Gaylene exclaims in pain]

38:54.131 --> 38:55.999
[Gaylene] Son of a bitch!

38:56.001 --> 38:57.934
Now you're making me mad.

38:57.936 --> 38:59.169
[Gaylene shrieks in pain]

39:00.071 --> 39:01.604
He didn't need love and light.

39:01.606 --> 39:03.807
<i>He needed to get
his ass whipped.</i>

39:03.809 --> 39:07.811
And so, that's what I did
'cause not only did it scare me,

39:07.813 --> 39:11.014
it irritated the crap out of me.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.982
[screaming noises]

39:16.454 --> 39:18.154
[rattling stops]

39:22.827 --> 39:24.961
[Gaylene panting]

39:25.863 --> 39:27.297
Look at the meters.

39:28.232 --> 39:30.500
Everything just stopped
all at once.

39:33.003 --> 39:35.071
[Gaylene]
<i>When it was finally over,</i>

39:35.073 --> 39:39.042
and it took quite some time
and a lot of energy.

39:39.044 --> 39:43.246
<i>I had to go
and just find a chair</i>

39:43.248 --> 39:46.516
<i>because my energy
was absolutely zapped.</i>

39:46.518 --> 39:48.251
The Soulkeeper.

39:48.953 --> 39:49.986
He's gone?

39:49.988 --> 39:51.321
For now.

39:52.890 --> 39:55.058
[sighs] But this place...
[laughs]

39:55.060 --> 40:00.063
[Gaylene] I think that the
shop was just a perfect place,

40:00.065 --> 40:03.066
a perfect storm for all
of this paranormal activity

40:03.068 --> 40:04.200
<i>for several reasons.</i>

40:04.202 --> 40:06.336
Daydreams and Nightmares.

40:07.171 --> 40:09.472
The perfect name
for the perfect storm.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.108
What does that mean?

40:12.443 --> 40:13.943
Dana.

40:13.945 --> 40:17.914
Your store was a funeral home
that had a contract with local prisons.

40:17.916 --> 40:21.217
The negative energy here
is very powerful.

40:21.986 --> 40:24.187
Plus there's Modesto itself.

40:24.789 --> 40:27.357
An area with
a long violent past.

40:28.225 --> 40:30.193
<i>[Gaylene] I informed her,
you know,</i>

40:30.195 --> 40:31.761
<i>don't put that mirror back.</i>

40:31.763 --> 40:34.631
<i>Don't do any
investigations at all.</i>

40:34.633 --> 40:38.902
Nothing. Not even a recorder.
Nothing for at least

40:38.904 --> 40:41.838
uh, you know, a few weeks,
I can't tell you how long.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.673
But give it a chance
to calm down.

40:43.675 --> 40:46.209
Give it a chance to mellow out.

40:48.546 --> 40:53.983
<i>[narrator] Months go by and
the shop is as quiet as a morgue.</i>

40:54.752 --> 40:57.220
<i>[Dana] So, with having the shop,</i>

40:57.222 --> 41:01.424
I have seen
different sides of my family,

41:01.725 --> 41:05.628
<i>of my friends, everybody.</i>

41:05.630 --> 41:11.034
<i>[Milan] I think that the shop
has made us a little stronger</i>

41:11.036 --> 41:12.936
<i>and kind of made
us a little more</i>

41:12.938 --> 41:18.208
open to what could
and could not happen.

41:19.343 --> 41:20.910
<i>[Jaidon] The experiences
in the shop</i>

41:20.912 --> 41:26.182
and the feelings in the shop have
really brought my family closer together.

41:29.687 --> 41:34.557
[narrator] But sometimes <i>the
past can't help repeating itself.</i>

41:34.559 --> 41:39.896
<i>And once closed portals
becomes revolving doors.</i>

41:39.898 --> 41:42.165
<i>[Dana] I was closing down
the shop with Mishelle</i>

41:42.566 --> 41:45.335
<i>and I saw something.</i>

41:48.839 --> 41:50.974
Mishelle!

41:50.976 --> 41:53.109
People who don't
believe in paranormal,

41:53.844 --> 41:55.578
<i>I tell them, "Come to my shop.</i>

41:58.215 --> 41:59.449
<i>You'll leave a believer."</i>
