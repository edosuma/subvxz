we didn't scare you off.

38:13.465 --> 38:15.771
The hospital's handling
of these patient deaths

38:15.815 --> 38:19.166
has left a lot to be desired.
Well, not anymore.

38:19.209 --> 38:21.124
I am personally committed
to making sure

38:21.168 --> 38:23.170
that we do right
by our veterans.

38:24.519 --> 38:27.479
- I think I have someone you
could talk to who could help.

38:31.047 --> 38:32.571
- I'll give him a call.

38:34.399 --> 38:35.835
I also wanted to say

38:35.878 --> 38:39.621
I see a lot of potential
for growth, for healing.

38:43.973 --> 38:45.627
- How are you feeling?

38:47.760 --> 38:51.329
- Well, um, on the upside,
I might have a new therapist,

38:51.372 --> 38:54.549
but, um, on the other hand,

38:54.593 --> 38:57.552
I'm still shaken up,
and I might not be able

38:57.596 --> 38:59.075
to sleep in the van tonight.

38:59.119 --> 39:01.948
- Do you want to stay with me?

39:01.991 --> 39:04.385
I might even have
an extra room available.

39:08.084 --> 39:10.260
- Do you mean Maggie's?

39:10.304 --> 39:12.393
- I can't keep
the door locked forever.

39:12.437 --> 39:15.353
At some point, I'm gonna have
to face what happened,

39:15.396 --> 39:18.356
and I think I know how.

39:21.054 --> 39:22.403
- Mar, I can't
thank you enough.

39:22.447 --> 39:25.101
- Maybe save the thanks
until after

39:25.145 --> 39:29.018
you've survived a night with
several Donny Osmond posters.

39:29.062 --> 39:32.413
- Actually,
sounds quite soothing.

39:32.457 --> 39:34.589
[laughter]

39:34.633 --> 39:37.375
- I can take you two home.

39:38.463 --> 39:40.116
- That'd be great.

39:42.510 --> 39:45.121
- Hey, Winchester,
before you go...

39:50.518 --> 39:53.956
I just want to thank you
for what you did back there.

39:55.175 --> 39:56.611
- You're welcome.

39:56.655 --> 39:59.309
- If you ever want to talk...

40:02.138 --> 40:04.358
You let me know, okay?

40:05.925 --> 40:08.841
- Yeah, I will.
