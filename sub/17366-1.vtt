00:11.072 --> 00:16.024
On today's show, James catches fire.

00:16.059 --> 00:18.037
Richard knocks something over.

00:18.072 --> 00:21.048
And I crash a Reliant Robin
into to a lamppost.

00:28.012 --> 00:29.045
Hello!

00:29.080 --> 00:31.096
Hello, we're back! We're back!

00:33.048 --> 00:35.008
We're back and we are...

00:36.060 --> 00:39.001
.. more sensible than ever.

00:39.036 --> 00:42.044
Well, we're starting
sensibly anyway, with this,

00:42.079 --> 00:43.993
the Bentley Continental GT.

00:44.028 --> 00:46.057
It's not my cup of tea,
if I'm honest,

00:46.092 --> 00:51.576
but if you live in Cheshire and
you have to travel great distances

00:51.611 --> 00:57.060
at high speed in drinks globe luxury
it really is in a class of one.

00:57.095 --> 01:01.064
Now, however, there's a new
version which is a bit different.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:11.036 --> 01:16.012
It's called the Continental
Supersports, and this is it.

01:16.047 --> 01:23.056
The fastest, most outlandish car
Bentley has ever made.

01:23.091 --> 01:25.989
First of all, it's been lightened.

01:26.024 --> 01:30.061
The rear seat has been
replaced with air.

01:30.096 --> 01:37.088
The sofas up front are now racing buckets trimmed
in the Duke of Westminster's smoking jacket.

01:39.040 --> 01:43.052
And there is carbon fibre on
the dash rather than walnut.

01:47.012 --> 01:52.068
The result is dramatic because that car
weighs just two and a quarter tons,

01:52.103 --> 01:56.024
about the same as a three
bedroom terraced house.

01:59.064 --> 02:03.052
Still, it's not like there isn't
enough power to deal with the bulk.

02:03.087 --> 02:09.039
It has the same engine as before,
a 6 litre twin turbo W12,

02:09.074 --> 02:15.008
but now it produces 621 horsepower.

02:19.020 --> 02:24.024
The result is 0 to 60 in 3.7 seconds.

02:40.080 --> 02:46.052
God, that is 167, 168
and it's still pulling!

02:48.092 --> 02:52.973
Flat out, it will do
204 miles an hour,

02:53.008 --> 02:57.048
even if you fill the tank
with Jerusalem artichokes.

03:05.076 --> 03:11.024
That engine has been designed to run on something
called bioethanol, fuel made from plants.

03:11.059 --> 03:15.559
And if you use that rather than
petrol the power output remains

03:15.594 --> 03:20.060
the same, but you get fewer carbon
dioxides coming out of the back.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.012
Sounds wonderful, if you believe
in this carbon malarkey,

03:28.047 --> 03:30.036
but there are a couple of drawbacks.

03:32.032 --> 03:40.064
First of all, there are 8,850 petrol stations
in Britain, but only 20 of them sell bio-ethanol.

03:40.099 --> 03:47.000
And, secondly, when you're running on
maize it's not what you'd call economical.

03:50.064 --> 03:54.056
Honestly, it gets through veg
faster than Paul McCartney's ex.

03:56.064 --> 03:59.969
The Supersports, then,
it's all much as you'd expect,

04:00.004 --> 04:05.060
very fast, very heavy and at speed
about six miles to the gallon.

04:08.036 --> 04:11.076
But don't be fooled by the headlines.

04:11.111 --> 04:16.012
This is spooky.

04:16.048 --> 04:22.064
I've got an automatic gearbox and air conditioning,
satellite navigation and it's very quiet.

04:22.099 --> 04:28.068
It's just like a normal Bentley, but
look at the way it changes direction.

04:36.052 --> 04:42.040
This car is like an elephant with
the reflexes of a water boatman.

04:42.075 --> 04:45.579
And if you're watching in
Poland and you don't know what

04:45.614 --> 04:49.049
a water boatman is, it's
like an Evo X, it really is.

04:49.084 --> 04:54.016
And if you're watching in Ethiopia
and you don't know what an Evo X is,

04:54.051 --> 04:59.020
what I mean is it does things
rather well. No, not well!

04:59.055 --> 05:01.068
Why did I say "well"? Oh, God.

05:03.024 --> 05:09.000
Then you have the brakes
which can tear your face off.

05:09.035 --> 05:11.048
Ready, now!

05:20.052 --> 05:24.033
To make the Bentley a race track
screamer it's been fitted with

05:24.068 --> 05:30.096
carbon ceramic discs, new suspension
bushes and different anti roll bars.

05:30.131 --> 05:34.004
Though when I say different
I mean, of course, enormous.

05:36.040 --> 05:42.004
They've also reprogrammed the four wheel drive
system so that now most of the power goes to the back.

05:46.052 --> 05:52.036
Imagine then that if you mash the throttle
into the carpets halfway around a corner

05:52.071 --> 05:58.048
it will spin up its rear wheels and
hang its tail out like a small dog.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.072
Sorry, but was a dreadful
simile, dogs don't have wheels.

06:03.107 --> 06:05.056
Unless they'd been in an accident.

06:08.016 --> 06:10.041
But here's the extraordinary thing, OK?

06:10.076 --> 06:15.000
It doesn't! Coming up to the
Hammerhead going the wrong way,

06:15.035 --> 06:16.072
halfway round, foot hard down...

06:24.028 --> 06:27.076
.. it doesn't! It just grips.

06:31.012 --> 06:37.012
Of course, you can make it misbehave if you
go way too fast and poke it with a stick.

06:43.040 --> 06:47.013
But even if you do that
the computer steps in,

06:47.048 --> 06:53.020
sends power to the front wheels
and, bang, everything is sorted out!

06:53.055 --> 06:55.044
It is uncanny.

06:57.020 --> 07:00.076
It is a very impressive car, this.

07:00.111 --> 07:02.973
But I don't like it.

07:03.008 --> 07:08.084
What they've tried to do here is
turn an ocean liner into a speedboat.

07:12.096 --> 07:15.973
And, yes, they have sort of pulled it off,

07:16.008 --> 07:22.084
but it still feels very big
and very heavy. Oh dear!

07:34.092 --> 07:36.044
Whoa!

07:41.004 --> 07:48.008
So big and so heavy in fact that I believe
it has just shredded its rear tyres.

07:50.096 --> 07:57.092
Oh dear! Now, I don't think
that's legal any more or safe.

08:04.012 --> 08:05.973
The upshot then is simple.

08:06.008 --> 08:10.993
If I wanted to spend
L163,000 on a speedboat

08:11.028 --> 08:16.000
I'd buy something that was designed
to be a speedboat in the first place.

08:18.008 --> 08:23.004
In short, I'd buy an Aston Martin DBS.

08:40.024 --> 08:41.083
Thank you very much.

08:44.028 --> 08:48.000
Really? You would have the Aston?

08:48.035 --> 08:48.973
Oh, yeah.

08:49.008 --> 08:51.060
No, it's more nimble,
it's got two more seats,

08:51.095 --> 08:53.017
doesn't weigh the same as a church.

08:53.052 --> 08:57.008
Doesn't eat its own shoes. No,this is t
he best car in the world. No, it isn't.

08:57.043 --> 09:01.000
Yes, it is. Anyway,
we must now find out how fast

09:01.035 --> 09:03.017
the Wilmslow Express goes round our track

09:03.052 --> 09:07.064
and that, of course, means handing
it over to our tame racing driver.

09:07.099 --> 09:12.092
Some say that his discharge is luminous...

09:15.028 --> 09:19.546
.. and that even as we speak he
is appearing on the main stage

09:19.581 --> 09:24.064
at Glastonbury performing his
most famous hit, Superstition.

09:27.048 --> 09:30.024
All we know is he's called The Stig.

09:31.080 --> 09:36.080
He's off! Note the flags there, Stig displaying
his support for the Norwegian football team.

09:36.115 --> 09:41.080
I tried to explain they aren't actually in
the World Cup, but this made him very angry.

09:41.115 --> 09:45.056
Here he is, first corner, looking nice.

09:45.091 --> 09:47.008
Yes!

09:49.076 --> 09:55.558
Interestingly, he's the only person in the world
who likes the sound of the vuvuzela,
because he invented it!

09:55.593 --> 09:59.024
There he is, round Chicago,
very tidy for a big car.

09:59.059 --> 10:01.088
Now, Hammerhead.
This should be astonishing.

10:03.072 --> 10:06.080
Oh no, it's exploded!
It's rolled end over end!

10:06.115 --> 10:09.569
This is incredible!
But Stig's out of the wreckage!

10:09.604 --> 10:13.024
He's dodging the naked
waitresses and... he's on fire!

10:13.059 --> 10:14.045
He's now coming up to Gambon.

10:14.080 --> 10:17.058
No, no! He's taking his helmet off!

10:17.093 --> 10:20.001
It's her! Right round the tiger!

10:20.036 --> 10:25.033
He's just a shaken hands with Elvis
and there he is, across the line!

10:25.068 --> 10:32.024
I don't believe that, the most exciting thing
I've ever seen and some idiot at Television Centre

10:32.059 --> 10:35.017
cut to an advertisement for a
stupid little Korean hatchback.

10:35.052 --> 10:40.056
It's a good job ITV didn't cover
the moon landings. 10 foot.

10:40.091 --> 10:42.021
Five foot.

10:42.056 --> 10:45.076
# If you like a lot of
chocolate on your biscuit... #

10:45.111 --> 10:48.017
Anyway, I have the time

10:48.052 --> 10:52.558
and it did it in 1:24.9,
which puts it there.

10:52.593 --> 10:57.029
And that's not bad,
really, for a small moon.

10:57.064 --> 11:02.064
Anyway, now we must turn our attention to the
Icelandic volcano because although it went on

11:02.099 --> 11:07.553
to become global news, the actual
eruption itself started out quite

11:07.588 --> 11:13.008
small and that got us wondering how
close could you get to it in a car.

11:13.012 --> 11:17.080
Now, obviously, this was a job for
a rugged, outdoorsy sort of chap.

11:17.115 --> 11:20.060
Unfortunately, Jeremy was on holiday,

11:20.095 --> 11:22.040
so James went.

11:29.004 --> 11:33.000
It's very hard to drive across
Iceland at the best of times.

11:35.076 --> 11:38.061
But luckily I had just
the vehicle for the job.

11:38.096 --> 11:45.040
This looks exactly like the
Toyota that Jeremy and I

11:45.075 --> 11:47.033
drove to the North Pole.

11:47.068 --> 11:50.044
More to the point, this has
been to the North Pole with us,

11:50.079 --> 11:54.048
but you never saw it and it
never got any of the glory

11:54.083 --> 11:58.017
because it was the one
driven by the camera crew.

11:58.052 --> 12:05.060
After we got back from the Pole our car went off
to a museum whereas this one was just left to rot.

12:05.095 --> 12:10.028
Today, though, I'm going to bring it back
to life and give it one more mission.

12:14.068 --> 12:19.080
Wow, I never actually thoughtI'd be
so pleased to seeone of these again.

12:19.115 --> 12:21.029
This really brings it all back,

12:21.064 --> 12:27.048
the ice going on and on forever, the
boulder field going on and on forever.

12:27.083 --> 12:29.076
I can hear Jeremy going
on and on forever.

12:31.016 --> 12:33.044
Oh, God...

12:35.064 --> 12:40.056
No matter, my job is to turn this into
the world's first volcano-proof car,

12:40.091 --> 12:42.989
which means a visit to Emil,

12:43.024 --> 12:48.025
the 4x4 genius who built
it in the first place.

12:48.060 --> 12:51.001
I mean, what are the unique
risks to volcano driving,

12:51.036 --> 12:54.088
apart from obviously being consumed
by molten lava and burnt to a crisp?

12:54.123 --> 12:56.057
It depends on how close you want to get.

12:56.092 --> 12:59.981
Very close. As far as I can work
out no-one's ever actually driven

13:00.016 --> 13:04.088
right up to the mouth of an active volcano in a car,
so it's another Top Gear first if we can do it.

13:04.123 --> 13:06.017
Yeah.

13:06.052 --> 13:10.068
Some people claim you can walk on
hot coals if you wet the bottom

13:10.103 --> 13:14.049
of your feet and I was just
wondering, if there was some system

13:14.084 --> 13:20.032
of continuously wetting the tyres would it
be possible to drive across the hot lava?

13:20.067 --> 13:24.056
If you don't fall through,
possibly, yeah, if you drive fast.

13:27.068 --> 13:29.044
Emile didn't look very confident,

13:29.079 --> 13:33.036
but we set to work anyway...

13:35.028 --> 13:39.060
.. and by the next morning
the volcano-buster was ready.

13:45.004 --> 13:48.080
I know I look a bit like a petty thief on
my way home from some corrugated roof robbery

13:48.115 --> 13:52.012
at the allotment, but there's a
very good reason for all of this.

13:52.047 --> 13:54.985
Their lava occasionally goes
over an area of water and that

13:55.020 --> 14:00.025
causes an explosion throwing bits
of lava and rock up into the air,

14:00.060 --> 14:06.000
so that's there to stop those lumps coming
down and breaking the windscreen, or my head.

14:09.004 --> 14:12.985
We've also fitted our new and
pioneering tyre cooling system.

14:13.020 --> 14:17.036
There's an oil drum on the back full of
water and pipes feed the water to the tyres.

14:17.071 --> 14:20.981
Now, obviously, there's a risk of it
freezing and we can't put antifreeze

14:21.016 --> 14:26.016
in the water because that pollutes the
glacier, so we've added a dash of vodka.

14:31.012 --> 14:33.021
As I drove on to the glacier,
I stopped to hook up with

14:33.056 --> 14:38.064
a volcanologist who couldn't get to
the volcano because of the weather.

14:43.072 --> 14:47.997
And it's fantastically windy.
I've never seen or felt a wind like it.

14:48.032 --> 14:53.084
Because of this storm that has been raging
for the last few days, we haven't really
been able to visit

14:53.119 --> 14:56.037
the area to see what's going on there.

14:56.072 --> 15:00.032
So at the moment, with this
weather, in this white-out,

15:00.067 --> 15:02.012
really nobody knows what's happening.

15:02.047 --> 15:05.045
Exactly. Nobody can say.

15:05.080 --> 15:08.989
As night fell, the storm became worse.

15:09.024 --> 15:13.076
It was so bad that by morning, it
had taken the lives of two locals.

15:15.060 --> 15:20.048
This is what we're seeing, or what
we're not seeing, I should say.

15:23.088 --> 15:26.993
Visibility is probably less than 10m.

15:27.028 --> 15:33.060
We reckoned that as long as we could follow
the car carrying Emil and the camera crew,
we'd be OK.

15:35.056 --> 15:36.088
There it is. There he is.

15:38.004 --> 15:39.080
But we weren't.

15:41.060 --> 15:43.044
Oh, I've lost the tail lights.

15:43.079 --> 15:44.096
Wow, that's dark.

15:47.028 --> 15:49.989
Soon, we were completely lost.

15:50.024 --> 15:53.024
Can you see any red lights?
I don't see anything.

15:53.059 --> 15:55.028
Oh, cock.

15:59.012 --> 16:02.001
Right, we are now, effectively,
driving on instruments.

16:02.036 --> 16:05.036
Outside the window is just...
it's a complete sheet of white.

16:05.071 --> 16:07.029
There's a blizzard going.

16:07.064 --> 16:09.064
The windscreen itself is freezing up.

16:09.099 --> 16:11.064
The windscreen wipers have frozen up.

16:11.099 --> 16:14.057
It's quite unnerving.

16:14.092 --> 16:18.020
Eventually, I had to get
out to unjam the wipers.

16:18.055 --> 16:21.048
Ah! Oh, my God.

16:21.083 --> 16:23.071
Blinding.

16:23.106 --> 16:25.060
Look at that.

16:38.072 --> 16:40.080
Good job.

16:42.080 --> 16:46.985
God, I've never known anything like that.

16:47.020 --> 16:49.048
I hadn't realised how strong
that was, being in here.

16:49.083 --> 16:50.997
I could hardly stand up.

16:51.032 --> 16:56.028
We ploughed onwards
until, at last, salvation.

16:56.063 --> 17:01.024
Lights! Look, lights!
There they are. Thank God.

17:03.064 --> 17:06.981
Eventually, the storm
cleared and we arrived at

17:07.016 --> 17:12.028
our overnight stop, where we were
greeted by a spectacular sight.

17:12.063 --> 17:14.096
Wow, look at that! Beautiful.

17:16.060 --> 17:18.029
How far away is that?

17:18.064 --> 17:21.023
About one and a half kilometres.

17:21.059 --> 17:23.529
I can hear it, as well.

17:23.564 --> 17:26.000
It's like cannon fire.

17:26.035 --> 17:28.036
That's fantastic.

17:35.056 --> 17:42.088
The next morning, still with no idea how
big this eruption would become, I dropped
off the professor...

17:42.123 --> 17:44.013
Thanks for a ride.

17:44.048 --> 17:51.056
.. and headed on alone, until at last I
got my first close-up look at the volcano.

18:01.064 --> 18:03.044
God in heaven, look at that.

18:08.088 --> 18:12.033
Lava was spewing out at a temperature
of 1,200 degrees centigrade,

18:12.068 --> 18:18.012
and right in front of my eyes, a brand-new
part of the world was being created.

18:18.047 --> 18:21.025
It was now my job to test our
volcano car by driving up to

18:21.060 --> 18:27.032
the crater and scooping up a fresh
piece of landscape as a souvenir.

18:27.067 --> 18:30.084
And to help me with that, they've
given me a garden trowel,

18:30.119 --> 18:34.096
on an extending pole, held
on with sticky tape, and...

18:36.048 --> 18:37.993
.. a bucket.

18:38.028 --> 18:40.969
And of course, I have my corrugated roof

18:41.004 --> 18:45.028
and I'm in the best off-road
vehicle I've ever driven.

18:45.063 --> 18:47.092
So, piece of cake, really.
Here we go.

19:00.032 --> 19:02.040
Does look quite angry.

19:05.004 --> 19:07.021
Oh, God, look at that.

19:07.056 --> 19:10.997
Even though I was driving on
lava that had fallen days ago,

19:11.032 --> 19:17.036
it was still red hot, and the Top Gear
vodka tyre cooling system was working overtime.

19:17.071 --> 19:21.028
Right, what I need is for a
piece to land quite near me,

19:21.063 --> 19:25.088
and then I can reach out
of the window and grab it.

19:25.123 --> 19:27.080
Ooh!

19:30.072 --> 19:33.052
Bravely, I decided that was far enough.

19:33.087 --> 19:35.061
Oh, my word.

19:35.096 --> 19:39.056
I don't know if you can see this
but it's raining red-hot lumps.

19:39.091 --> 19:42.047
It's quite...

19:42.082 --> 19:44.969
God, that's hot.

19:45.004 --> 19:48.072
It was time to break
out the lava scoop.

19:53.012 --> 19:54.546
Whoa! Bloody hellfire.

19:54.581 --> 19:56.045
Look at the size of that!

19:56.080 --> 19:59.000
A piece of that would do nicely.

20:00.044 --> 20:02.522
Whoa!

20:02.557 --> 20:04.965
Yes! Yes!

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
It's still glowing slightly.

20:08.035 --> 20:09.041
Yay-hey!

20:09.076 --> 20:13.008
God, that's hot.

20:13.043 --> 20:15.012
Whoa!

20:17.092 --> 20:20.021
Oh, that's getting a bit frisky.

20:20.056 --> 20:25.004
In the excitement of bagging a souvenir,
I'd stayed still for too long.

20:27.080 --> 20:31.004
We're on fire. Right, I'm off.

20:34.088 --> 20:40.008
With the tyres steaming, I beat
a retreat from the volcano,

20:40.043 --> 20:44.043
clutching my brand-new
piece of planet Earth.

20:44.078 --> 20:48.044
I claim you for Queen
Elizabeth and Top Gear.

20:53.088 --> 21:00.068
And best of all, the unsung hero finally
got the recognition it deserves.

21:16.036 --> 21:18.524
And...

21:18.559 --> 21:21.012
Here is...

21:24.036 --> 21:27.061
Is that it? The piece of lava I
brought backfor you. What a souvenir!

21:27.096 --> 21:32.061
Do you know, it was quite interesting. I
asked a volcanologist the other day what
caused that

21:32.096 --> 21:37.574
small eruption we saw in the film there to
become so massive, to shut down all of
Europe's airspace.

21:37.609 --> 21:43.052
And he said there must have been a trigger
of some kind, a disturbance near the actual
crater itself.

21:43.087 --> 21:47.969
Yes, something to do with weight, he said.
It would need about two tonnes.

21:48.004 --> 21:52.040
If it was in the right place, it could
trigger all of that. That's not strictly
true, is it?

21:52.075 --> 21:57.052
James, have you been working recently
on any oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico?

21:57.087 --> 22:03.041
Let's do the news. Just before we
do, I don'tknow if you've heard...

22:03.076 --> 22:09.008
Barack Obama's been prattling on about
British Petroleum and "this is 9/11 X
1,000," this oil spill...

22:09.043 --> 22:12.096
Did you hear how the English football fans
responded during the America game the other day?

22:12.131 --> 22:17.060
They were actually singing,
"You're not swimming any more!"

22:19.024 --> 22:21.096
That is classic.
Right, let's really do the news.

22:21.131 --> 22:23.965
Yes, the news.

22:24.000 --> 22:31.060
Ferrari has broken the lap record of the
Nurburgring for production cars with this,
the 599XX.

22:31.095 --> 22:33.009
It did it in 6 minutes, 58 seconds.

22:33.044 --> 22:37.088
Nurburgring? That's faster than than
Clay Regazzoni'slap record in an F1 car.

22:38.064 --> 22:43.036
I know the track's a bit shorter now, but
that is almost unbelievably fast. For a road car.

22:43.071 --> 22:45.977
For a production car.
That's incredible.

22:46.012 --> 22:50.008
It does have a six-litre V12 and 772 horsepower,

22:50.043 --> 22:55.969
and it costs L 1.2 million.

22:56.004 --> 22:58.969
And, you can't actually have it.

22:59.004 --> 23:02.009
Well, unless you've got
L 1.2 million, obviously.

23:02.044 --> 23:06.084
No, you can buy it, and you own it,
but then they don't let you have it,

23:06.119 --> 23:09.029
but they do let you drive it
occasionally, if they feel like it.

23:09.064 --> 23:13.032
Can I just say, this was the actual
photograph that Ferrari sent to us

23:13.067 --> 23:15.041
to show what the car looked
like at the Nurburgring.

23:15.076 --> 23:19.028
Now, I'm not sure it's particularly brilliant.
If we look at the graffiti on the track...

23:22.068 --> 23:27.053
That's not a map of the Nurburgring,
is it? No. I... They didn't see that?

23:27.088 --> 23:31.981
You've seen it now. Too late. And I have
to say, the manwho's responsible for this

23:32.016 --> 23:36.032
piece of graffiti has also been at work in Russia
on a drawbridge. I've got a picture here.

23:38.092 --> 23:42.546
We're supposed to be being serious. Yeah,
we are. According to the newspapers...

23:42.581 --> 23:46.965
Haven't we just shown two crudely-drawn
images of a man's private parts? Yes.

23:47.000 --> 23:51.021
That's not serious, is it? According to the
newspapers,Top Gear has become serious.

23:51.056 --> 23:58.012
Yes. So, here we go. Gentlemen, tell me,
since we were last here, what is the best
car you've driven?

23:58.047 --> 23:59.029
Good question, glad you asked it.

23:59.064 --> 24:02.016
It would be this, the Lamborghini Gallardo.

24:02.051 --> 24:03.965
This is the Superleggera,
the new one.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.005
570. It's magnificent. Lightest, faster.
570 brake horsepower. Really?

24:08.040 --> 24:15.012
I haven't actually driven it as such, but
I've looked at that picture of it and I'm
desperate to drive it. 570.

24:15.047 --> 24:19.012
570. That's very interesting, because
the standard carhas 560, doesn't it? Yep.

24:19.047 --> 24:23.535
And then Ferrari brought out the
458, which has got, I think, 562.

24:23.570 --> 24:28.024
Yes, two more. And then, mysteriou
sly,Lamborghini came back with 570.

24:28.059 --> 24:29.981
We all know why it is.

24:30.016 --> 24:36.052
It's because Lamborghini are owned by Audi,
so the Germans do the actual building of
the cars, and then they...

24:36.087 --> 24:40.004
let the Italians do the brochure,
so they just fill in the numbers.

24:40.039 --> 24:42.004
It's got a million horsepower, yes!

24:42.039 --> 24:43.559
100,000. It's invisible.

24:43.594 --> 24:45.045
And it's got cannons!

24:45.080 --> 24:48.580
What about you, then? Come on.
I have actually driven it.

24:48.615 --> 24:52.045
AMG SLS. It is a mental.
We've got a picture of it here.

24:52.080 --> 24:58.012
Honestly, it is insanely fast. The only thing
I don't like about it, really, are the doors.

24:58.047 --> 25:01.973
It's got gull-wings, so I'll
probably wait for the convertible.

25:02.008 --> 25:06.044
How can you have gull-wing doors on
a convertible? They'd be all floppy.

25:06.079 --> 25:10.032
Idiot. You'd have normal doors
and then it would be fantastic.

25:10.067 --> 25:12.037
No, that was awesome.
So, James, you?

25:12.072 --> 25:17.056
Well, to be honest, I think it's got to be
the new Boxster Spider, which I'm driving next week.

25:17.091 --> 25:20.041
So you haven't driven that either?No...
He means... I've driven it, but...

25:20.076 --> 25:26.052
Oh, we're showing it on theprogramme next week.
Through the magic of television, we recorded it.

25:26.087 --> 25:28.965
Now, have a look at this.
This is a device.

25:29.000 --> 25:34.092
It fits on the exhaust pipe of your car and
as you drive along, it cooks a burger for
you.

25:36.084 --> 25:38.057
It's brilliant.
What, in the exhaust fumes?

25:38.092 --> 25:41.072
No, no, no. The exhaust
fumes don't cook the burger.

25:41.107 --> 25:44.017
It's like, you know, like
a toasted-sandwich maker?

25:44.052 --> 25:48.048
Your hot gas from the exhaust heats it up
and then it griddles the burger in between
the two bits.

25:48.083 --> 25:51.005
It's a bit close to the whole
exhaust process for food.

25:51.040 --> 25:56.060
Your testes are close to your bottom but
you still play with them all the time.

25:56.095 --> 26:01.008
Hammond. Yes, a normal Nissan
GTRcosts, what, 60 grand? 60 grand.

26:01.043 --> 26:05.008
OK. Well, this is the new one.
It's the Spec V. V Spec GTR.

26:05.043 --> 26:09.005
That is L125,000, all of a sudden.

26:09.040 --> 26:12.005
Yeah. Why is it L125,000.
It's difficult to tell.

26:12.040 --> 26:15.056
It doesn't have more power than the
normal car, but it does have something

26:15.091 --> 26:18.029
called a boost-control device.
Basically, it's a button.

26:18.064 --> 26:24.064
When you press it, it spools up both the turbos
and releases a sudden burst of more power!

26:24.099 --> 26:27.069
I just hope that button is
mounted on top of the gear lever

26:27.104 --> 26:30.005
under like a little cage and
you lift it and go.

26:30.040 --> 26:35.056
And then you've got to know the code word.
And maybe two keys in the dash have to be
turned simultaneously...

26:35.091 --> 26:39.079
Like on a nuclear submarine?
Yes,that's what I'm thinking! You turn...

26:39.114 --> 26:43.068
A mission from the president. It's a go.
I want it, just for that button.

26:43.103 --> 26:45.997
Yes. Because this is sensible Top Gear,
I will say

26:46.032 --> 26:49.052
it also comes with a very competitive
three-year warranty. Yeah.

26:49.087 --> 26:52.064
Now, are there any girls here? Good.

26:52.099 --> 26:55.989
Don't ever faint in Holland.

26:56.024 --> 26:58.061
That would be my Top Gear
top tip for the night.

26:58.096 --> 27:01.017
We've got some footage here,
explains what I'm on about.

27:01.052 --> 27:05.024
Start of a race. There's the grid girl.
Oh, she's gone a bit wobbly.

27:05.059 --> 27:07.000
And she's fainted. There you go.

27:08.064 --> 27:13.044
So you're thinking, "Poor girl." You're thinking,
"Ooh, no - now she's lying on the track."

27:13.079 --> 27:18.028
So, as we can see, men in high-visibility
jackets have come over to make sure she's ok.

27:18.063 --> 27:19.061
Or are they making sure she's OK?

27:19.096 --> 27:22.001
How do you...? Oh, put
your hand on her bottom.

27:22.036 --> 27:25.076
That's the ticket. That's what he'sdone.
Checking for her pulse.

27:25.111 --> 27:27.076
Now let's hear what the
driver's got to say.

27:35.020 --> 27:37.025
Get the girl off!

27:37.060 --> 27:40.032
That's a racing driver,
isn't it? All over.

27:40.067 --> 27:42.048
Everybody, good news.

27:44.008 --> 27:45.068
No, wait. It's better than you think.

27:45.103 --> 27:48.064
The new Dacia... Duster...

27:50.096 --> 27:53.024
IS coming to the UK. Ok!

27:53.059 --> 27:55.092
That's great.

28:00.040 --> 28:05.076
That's great. Good. Now, for this new series
of Top Gear, we have the new reasonably-priced car.

28:05.111 --> 28:10.084
I know, exciting. But it gave us
a dilemma what to do with the old one.

28:13.048 --> 28:15.965
Every year in Britain,

28:16.000 --> 28:19.001
over two million cars go to their deaths.

28:19.036 --> 28:22.076
And frankly, it's a pretty
cold and clinical affair.

28:22.111 --> 28:25.969
Tyres are made into carpet underlay.

28:26.004 --> 28:28.037
Dashboards are melted down
to make garden furniture.

28:28.072 --> 28:34.542
The once-sleek bodywork gets
reincarnated as a washing machine.

28:34.577 --> 28:41.012
All in all, a lot of eco-worthiness
but absolutely no emotion.

28:43.052 --> 28:46.029
And that's quite sad
when you think about it.

28:46.064 --> 28:51.060
Because the car doesn't just carry people.
It carries memories.

28:53.048 --> 28:55.017
Take this one, for example.

28:55.052 --> 29:00.092
It's an ancient Mazda 323 that will
never go up the hill at Goodwood...

29:00.127 --> 29:03.041
or turn on a plinth at a motor show.

29:03.076 --> 29:09.024
But it's been with the Lister
family of Maidenhead for 23 years.

29:09.059 --> 29:12.092
It took Mum to and from hospital
when the kids were born.

29:12.127 --> 29:14.973
It did years of school runs.

29:15.008 --> 29:21.032
And when Daniel and Rachel turned
17, they learned to drive in it.

29:21.067 --> 29:26.060
And then adopted it as their
passport to teenage freedom.

29:26.095 --> 29:30.093
Sadly, the Listers' 323
is soon to be scrapped.

29:30.128 --> 29:34.096
And it makes you realise
that when a car dies,

29:34.131 --> 29:38.064
it should be treated like
a death in the family.

29:40.016 --> 29:43.045
And today we find ourselves
in that very position.

29:43.080 --> 29:49.064
Because it's time to say goodbye to a
special member of the Top Gear family.

29:50.048 --> 29:52.060
Our old reasonably priced car.

29:52.095 --> 29:54.993
The Chevrolet Lacetti.

29:55.028 --> 30:00.080
As a machine, it was never destined
to set the automotive world alight.

30:00.115 --> 30:03.985
But it's certainly got some memories.

30:04.020 --> 30:12.020
Think of the real fear and
exhilaration experienced by real-life
celebrities in this car.

30:12.055 --> 30:17.064
The celebrity sweat from
celebrity bums in this seat.

30:17.099 --> 30:20.004
What a life it's been.

30:40.064 --> 30:43.041
But now, it's at the
end of its useful life,

30:43.076 --> 30:48.028
and because it's been such a hard
life, we're not allowed to sell it.

30:48.063 --> 30:52.033
So with regret, the Lacetti must die.

30:52.068 --> 30:56.041
But the thought of it being
crushed and recycled...

30:56.076 --> 31:03.004
and these tyres - Michael Gambon's tyres
being turned into carpet underlay...

31:03.039 --> 31:04.053
I'm sorry, no.

31:04.088 --> 31:10.048
So instead, we've decided
to give it a Viking burial.

31:11.052 --> 31:15.040
These magnificent chimneys
were built in 1969.

31:15.075 --> 31:17.053
They're 550' high,

31:17.088 --> 31:22.080
and they weigh 7,185 tonnes each.

31:23.084 --> 31:31.016
Except today, they weigh a little bit more
because each has been stuffed with 25
kilograms of nitroglycerine.

31:31.051 --> 31:36.013
In a few minutes, that'll go boom,
and these will come crashing down.

31:36.048 --> 31:43.052
And in the process, they'll create a
fitting tomb for our heroic little car.

31:43.087 --> 31:46.009
I can see already this
is the right thing to do.

31:46.044 --> 31:51.060
If I were a reasonably priced car that had
been driven round a television show's test track

31:51.095 --> 31:56.076
hundreds of times by celebrities
from all over the world, that is the way
I would want to go.

31:56.111 --> 32:00.000
I've never thought about it,
but that is how I'd want to go.

32:01.052 --> 32:06.072
With the assembled mourners looking
resplendent in high-visibility jackets,

32:06.107 --> 32:09.044
the funeral service was about to begin.

32:42.044 --> 32:44.025
And there we are.

32:44.060 --> 32:46.072
A dignified Viking burial.

32:46.107 --> 32:48.028
Nearly!

32:50.068 --> 32:56.048
You know, I can just see the nose of the
car sticking out, which is pretty shoddy.

32:58.032 --> 33:03.000
You're supposed to cover the whole body, that's
the basics, you don't walk away with an arm...

33:03.035 --> 33:06.016
sticking out of the ground and say,
that's that done!

33:06.051 --> 33:08.012
You cover it all up.

33:11.036 --> 33:13.040
Oh, my God.

33:17.016 --> 33:18.037
You idiot!

33:18.072 --> 33:20.040
What? How was I to know?

33:22.088 --> 33:26.060
"I nearly buried it"?
Nobody "nearly buries" anything!

33:26.095 --> 33:30.032
Anyway, we are very sad to
say goodbye to the Lacetti...

33:30.067 --> 33:33.013
No, we're not, actually,
we never really liked it.

33:33.048 --> 33:37.032
It was rubbish, to be honest.
Now it's time to unveil its replacement.

33:37.067 --> 33:39.985
And here it is. Anybody want
to guess what's under here?

33:40.020 --> 33:45.052
A Lamborghini, no, it isn't, it's the same
height as him, so it can't be a Lamborghini.

33:45.087 --> 33:48.052
They just haven't got this at all,
have they? Shall I just reveal?

33:48.087 --> 33:52.008
Are we ready? Here we go!
This is the big moment!

33:53.060 --> 33:55.012
It's a Kia!

33:57.020 --> 34:01.072
Specifically...

34:01.107 --> 34:03.567
the Kia...

34:03.602 --> 34:05.993
the Kia cee'd,

34:06.028 --> 34:13.052
the only car in the worldthat actually has an
apostrophe inits name. And what a machine it is.

34:13.087 --> 34:21.088
It has a 1.6 litre engine, which means it
can go from 0-60 in a dazzling 10.4 seconds.

34:21.123 --> 34:27.000
And it'll go on to a mind-boggling
top speed of 119 miles an hour.

34:27.034 --> 34:32.527
Engineered in Korea, built in Slovakia.
Finished in brown.

34:32.562 --> 34:36.809
It is on sale to you for an
incredibly reasonable L14,000.

34:36.844 --> 34:41.021
That's amazingly reasonable.
It is incredibly reasonable.

34:41.056 --> 34:47.004
Astonishing. But there is one more issue, because
new car means we've got a new lap time board.

34:47.039 --> 34:50.027
We couldn't just invite a celebrity
tonight, and ask them, "So!

34:50.063 --> 34:51.981
"Where do you think you came on the board?"

34:52.016 --> 34:57.020
because there's no other names on it.
So we've thought of a way of getting
lots of names on it all at once...

34:57.054 --> 35:04.036
by inviting lots of celebrities to an all-star
celebrity summer barbecue festival event.

35:06.016 --> 35:09.053
Since it was going to be
a celebrity-packed day,

35:09.088 --> 35:13.032
we arrived at the track good and
early to sort out the catering.

35:13.067 --> 35:16.033
I've got 32 sausages.
That's going to be enough.

35:16.068 --> 35:18.965
I've got a cauliflower for
if a vegetarian comes.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.088
With the barbecue lit, we turned
our minds to the guest list.

35:22.123 --> 35:25.085
Well, I've invited Harrison Ford,
Johnny Depp...

35:25.120 --> 35:28.013
Oh, you invited Johnny as well?
I invited Johnny Depp.

35:28.048 --> 35:32.024
He's been invited twice, but he won't mind.
I've invited her again.

35:32.059 --> 35:34.013
Look, if you invite Angelina,
she won't come.

35:34.048 --> 35:37.013
She will. - No, she won't.
- We're bigger than ever. She will.

35:37.048 --> 35:42.084
By 9am our spread was ready and we'd
laid out a selection of toys
to keep our A-listers entertained.

35:48.084 --> 35:50.033
I can't give Harrison Ford this.

35:50.068 --> 35:53.076
Do you think she saw when we
went to Vietnam on those bikes?

35:53.111 --> 35:56.040
No. She isn't coming.

35:57.092 --> 36:00.981
And she wasn't.
Who's that?That's not Angelina.

36:01.016 --> 36:05.048
I know who that is.
Nick Robinson, BBC Political Editor.

36:05.083 --> 36:07.037
I knew that. Nick.
Jeremy. How are you?

36:07.072 --> 36:11.068
Nick was looking forward to driving
our new reasonably priced car.

36:11.103 --> 36:15.004
Over there, in brown, the Kia cee'd.

36:15.039 --> 36:17.029
Now that is my sort of car.

36:17.064 --> 36:23.076
Dull, slow. But the PoliticalEditor's
start was far from slow.

36:27.032 --> 36:30.544
Ooh, I like the smell of burning rubber.
God, it's addictive!

36:30.579 --> 36:34.056
It would've been polite to
show an interest in Nick's lap.

36:34.091 --> 36:37.045
Here we go! Don't brake!

36:37.080 --> 36:42.004
But we got distracted by our
next guest - Al Murray...

36:42.039 --> 36:44.053
Hi. Pickled cucumber?
.. who is my kind of guy.

36:44.088 --> 36:51.076
My favourite medium tank of the war,
T-34-85 with the larger calibre gun that
could take on a tiger.

36:51.111 --> 36:55.008
As Nick was on his hot lap,
we should've paid attention.

36:55.043 --> 36:56.973
Not fifth, you...!

36:57.008 --> 36:59.052
But sadly, we got distracted again.

37:09.000 --> 37:09.969
Oh, I love it!

37:10.004 --> 37:14.052
Just give me a news conference now.
I tell you what, no politician is safe!

37:14.087 --> 37:17.072
It was time to put the first
ever result on the new board.

37:18.072 --> 37:21.005
Here it is.

37:21.040 --> 37:24.020
Nick Robinson, 1.499. First!

37:24.055 --> 37:26.965
You're the first! Amazing!

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
The fastest man ever to go
round this track in that car.

37:35.040 --> 37:36.981
As Al Murray roared off...

37:37.016 --> 37:39.028
Turn, turn, turn,
turn, you doughnut.

37:41.056 --> 37:44.017
.. tall Dragon Peter Jones arrived.

37:44.052 --> 37:49.080
My day just immediately takes
a downturn. No offence.

37:50.084 --> 37:54.004
With the hellos over, Peter unleashed
his killer instinct to win.

37:56.064 --> 38:00.076
Wait a minute! You're supposed
to let the other person...

38:00.111 --> 38:03.049
How competitive.
He's actually playing himself!

38:03.084 --> 38:07.052
With the game over, we should've
turned our attention to Al.

38:07.087 --> 38:12.977
Oh, yes! But at that mome
nt,a Page 3 girl arrived.

38:13.012 --> 38:16.032
Peta, 23, from Essex.
Hello, Jeremy Clarkson from Tops Gear.

38:16.067 --> 38:18.072
Tops Gear?! How are you?
Very well. Come along.

38:18.107 --> 38:20.965
You're not Jewish, are you?
I'm not, no.

38:21.000 --> 38:26.008
Good. So we've got sausages and
we've got bacon and everything.

38:26.043 --> 38:31.016
Peta didn't fancy ham and
sausages, or my vegetarian option.

38:31.051 --> 38:33.096
So at last we turned
our thoughts to Al...

38:35.088 --> 38:38.000
.. just as he crossed
the finishing line.

38:38.035 --> 38:39.029
One...

38:39.064 --> 38:41.080
Yes. Thank goodness it's a one.

38:41.115 --> 38:43.081
40... Yes.

38:43.116 --> 38:45.013
Ballpark.

38:45.048 --> 38:48.066
Eight... point one.

38:48.101 --> 38:51.049
You, sir, the fastest.

38:51.084 --> 38:53.973
A fact that Al was keen to
point out to Nick Robinson.

38:54.008 --> 38:57.033
Whenever I see you on TV now I'm
going to think, "Quicker than him".

38:57.068 --> 39:02.076
Whatever your Downing Street analysis
might be, you might know more about

39:02.111 --> 39:07.097
the inner workings of the
coalition, but I'm quicker than you.

39:07.132 --> 39:12.084
As the competitive Dragon pounded
round, we decided to spy on him.

39:12.119 --> 39:14.589
He doesn't know we can see him.

39:14.624 --> 39:17.060
# Come on baby, light my fire. #

39:20.008 --> 39:22.040
Next to arrive was Johnny Vaughan.

39:22.075 --> 39:24.037
Vaughany! All right, Clarky.

39:24.072 --> 39:29.016
Who as a former star in the car was keen
to gen up on the cee apostrophe dee.

39:29.051 --> 39:32.080
We're talking 124
brake horse power.

39:32.115 --> 39:34.079
What was the last one?

39:34.114 --> 39:36.009
The last one was 119.

39:36.044 --> 39:38.040
OK. So we're packing five more here.

39:38.075 --> 39:40.092
Five more horses in the stable.

39:42.056 --> 39:46.040
The competitive Dragon had
finished his whole lap.

39:46.075 --> 39:48.997
Please tell me that was quick.

39:49.032 --> 39:53.029
Now we would find out the difference
between our old Chevy and the new Kia.

39:53.064 --> 39:59.004
This is where all of South Korea is sitting
and going, "Do we make a fast car than
Chevrolet?"

39:59.039 --> 40:05.016
Seriously, can we go toe-to-toe with
the North across the bamboo curtain?

40:05.051 --> 40:08.068
Where were you in the old car? 1.469.

40:08.103 --> 40:11.020
You did it in one minute...

40:11.055 --> 40:13.024
Oh, Jeremy.

40:15.080 --> 40:18.088
45.9. Yes!

40:20.008 --> 40:23.072
That's going to take some strangling, that.
That's a second faster.

40:27.016 --> 40:30.048
As Peta, 23, from Essex hitthe track...
I cannot change gear.

40:30.083 --> 40:34.033
.. Hammond's dreams finally came true.

40:34.068 --> 40:38.088
Make-up does a lot. You might gain a few
pounds on thetelly, but it doesn't do that.

40:38.123 --> 40:39.985
It does. It does. Get off!

40:40.020 --> 40:44.004
Cos when Angelina comes, if you'vebent the
badge, she'll be cross. You can't have it!

40:44.039 --> 40:48.535
Out on the track, it was
starting to get wet and slippery.

40:48.570 --> 40:52.997
The chaps were desperately
concerned for Peta's welfare.

40:53.032 --> 40:57.076
When does a gazebo become a tent?All right.
This is not even a tent, is it? It is.

40:59.080 --> 41:02.981
It's a gazebo. No, it's not.
It's not even that.

41:03.016 --> 41:07.080
Despite the rain, Peta
matched Nick Robinson's time.

41:07.115 --> 41:09.096
Then Johnny Vaughan set off.

41:09.131 --> 41:11.037
Ignore the weather.

41:11.072 --> 41:14.076
To an inspiring
soundtrack from Angelina.

41:19.032 --> 41:21.009
Don't lose your bottle,
don't lose your bottle.

41:21.044 --> 41:24.076
Keep your foot down, keep your
foot down, keep your foot down.

41:27.068 --> 41:30.985
The weather got worse and worse.

41:31.020 --> 41:34.068
Someone left a cake out in the rain.

41:37.048 --> 41:40.028
This is where you've got to have balls.
This is where it counts.

41:40.063 --> 41:43.041
Meanwhile, I'd spotted our next guest.

41:43.076 --> 41:47.012
Someone I'd first encountered
on The Jonathan Ross Show.

41:47.047 --> 41:48.001
Oh, my God!

41:48.036 --> 41:50.981
It's Angelina Jolie. No.
Hammond, I've just remembered.

41:51.016 --> 41:56.080
It's June 10th, isn't it? Er, yes, it is.
My wife's birthday.

41:56.115 --> 41:58.989
What, today? Yeah. You idiot.

41:59.024 --> 42:03.032
I'm going to, no, seriously,I'm goin
g to go now, this second. What, now?!

42:03.067 --> 42:07.061
This second and I'm going to
get her a birthday present.

42:07.096 --> 42:10.578
Next guest is here. He's
brilliant, absolutely brilliant.

42:10.613 --> 42:14.025
Real man's man, you know?
I'll be back, I'll be back.

42:14.060 --> 42:17.088
So I'm looking after the...
?Yes, yes. What's he called? Louie.

42:17.123 --> 42:20.041
Where's Jeremy going?

42:20.076 --> 42:24.060
Oh, hello. All right? Hello. I'm Bill. Nice
to meet you. Hello, Louie. You all right?

42:24.095 --> 42:26.033
Louie seemed very friendly.

42:26.068 --> 42:30.028
Oh, mind. You're getting dribbled
there, darling. Just dribbling on you.

42:30.063 --> 42:32.072
Yeah, it's dribbling on you.

42:33.076 --> 42:35.057
Johnny was still out driving.

42:35.092 --> 42:37.997
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on!

42:38.032 --> 42:43.048
Bill went bird watching and that left
to me all alone with my new best friend.

42:49.000 --> 42:53.060
I'll be over here. I'm just having a little
stretch just before I get in there. Try it.

42:53.095 --> 42:57.075
Do what? Flat back over and just
stretch out your hamstrings.

42:57.110 --> 43:01.056
I'm, I've got a war wound fromfighting
a rugby player. No, no, no.

43:01.091 --> 43:03.053
No, honestly, you'll be surprised.

43:03.088 --> 43:11.008
With Jeremy still not back the celebrities
were getting more and more unruly.

43:11.043 --> 43:13.977
Bill, get off the track!
What the ... are you doing, Bill?

43:14.012 --> 43:17.048
The race track is no place for fancy cakes.
Do you want something to eat?

43:17.083 --> 43:19.005
All right. Custard
cream if you're asking.

43:19.040 --> 43:23.981
And one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

43:24.016 --> 43:28.526
And side, two, three, four, catch,
take it down, walk around, walk around.

43:28.561 --> 43:33.036
Flip ball change, flip ball change,
step turn, step turn, in and look.

43:36.008 --> 43:41.985
Mercifully, I had to go and put Johnny's time
on the lap board, but even that was stressful.

43:42.020 --> 43:47.088
We knock five seconds off, or we add
five seconds for a wet lap in our mind,
so it's five seconds gone.

43:51.076 --> 43:53.037
That's how it works!

43:53.072 --> 43:55.564
'Worse, Johnny started giving advice to Louie.'

43:55.599 --> 43:58.021
Watch your big end as you
slide through Hammerhead.

43:58.056 --> 44:02.044
Your back end will slide out if you
don't get the purchase up there.

44:02.079 --> 44:05.064
Also, watch your helmet
against the steel bar.

44:05.099 --> 44:07.041
'Clarkson finally got back. '

44:07.076 --> 44:11.001
Hammond! 'Just as the
fire was being put out.'

44:11.036 --> 44:13.993
Don't put the fire barbecue out!
I wanted one of those sausages.

44:14.028 --> 44:18.056
Louie, what have you done with the fireman
who was in that jacket and helmet?

44:18.091 --> 44:21.028
Have things not been going
smoothly since I just...

44:21.063 --> 44:23.553
Yeah, yeah. It's gone well. Has it?

44:23.588 --> 44:26.009
As Angelina wrestled with the Kia...

44:26.044 --> 44:31.048
Turn! Turn... We get out of the turn with
speed, yes, because speed is our friend.

44:31.083 --> 44:33.033
.. our next guest arrived.

44:33.068 --> 44:39.092
Amy Williams, Britain's only gold
medallist at the Winter Olympics.

44:39.127 --> 44:41.013
What is it that's worrying you?

44:41.048 --> 44:46.068
I'm quite scared and I'm worried that I'm
just going to skid off course by trying to
be too quick.

44:46.103 --> 44:48.981
Wait a minute.
You earned your notoriety...

44:49.016 --> 44:55.052
from, let's be honest, skidding down a mountain
at extremely high speed. Sophisticated skidding!

44:58.076 --> 45:01.005
I think that was... Was it a crow?
Or was it a raven?

45:01.040 --> 45:06.092
In the celebrity gymnasium, I too was
enjoying a spot of bird watching.

45:06.127 --> 45:09.080
Take your arms up to the side.

45:11.096 --> 45:15.049
Squats. Meanwhile, Richard
Hammond is with Louie Spence.

45:15.084 --> 45:20.056
And you go flat out through there,
and you come to a tight left here.

45:20.091 --> 45:22.973
Right. Quite a wide bit
of the track there.

45:23.008 --> 45:27.040
So I can just go back to the flat out
but up here, this tight bit here?

45:27.075 --> 45:32.016
You just go flat out through there,
and then flat out round there.

45:32.051 --> 45:34.084
So, why am I so tight
up to the edge here?

45:34.119 --> 45:37.981
As Jeremy tried to impress Amy...

45:38.016 --> 45:41.965
I'm extremely fit. I don't think
a lot of people realise that.

45:42.000 --> 45:46.060
.. Angelina was finishing her lap,
confident that she'd beaten Johnny Vaughan.

45:48.028 --> 45:53.026
He was 1:53.3.
You did it in 1:50.8.

45:53.061 --> 45:58.024
Oh ho ho! Now that... That's good.

46:00.080 --> 46:02.025
.. when Louie out on the track.

46:02.060 --> 46:05.001
Where's that corner gone?
There it is.

46:05.036 --> 46:12.020
I wanted to say hello to Amy, but unfortunately
she was still being monopolised.

46:13.076 --> 46:16.032
I can do Congratulations,
are you ready?

46:16.067 --> 46:17.084
Yeah.

46:25.060 --> 46:28.030
Despite a few pirouettes...

46:28.065 --> 46:31.000
.. Louie finally banged in a lap.

46:33.012 --> 46:37.516
You did it in 1:53.69.

46:37.551 --> 46:41.985
Louie was very unhappy.

46:42.020 --> 46:43.076
I gave a better show than Johnny.

46:43.111 --> 46:45.061
I mean he took no chances.

46:45.096 --> 46:49.060
No chances at all! So I left him and
Hammond to say a tender goodbye...

46:49.095 --> 46:52.067
Can I have my helmet back now?

46:52.102 --> 46:55.005
.. and escorted Amy to the car.

46:55.040 --> 46:59.080
OK, so, skeleton run, here we go.
But in a car.

47:01.056 --> 47:03.080
I was looking forward
to watching her lap.

47:03.115 --> 47:05.583
But Hammond kept shouting at me.

47:05.618 --> 47:08.017
I've been running all of his.

47:08.052 --> 47:10.564
I've been in charge of
everything you see here.

47:10.599 --> 47:13.041
This whole operation takes
a lot of looking after.

47:13.076 --> 47:17.048
I've been back for hours. Standing on
wobbling machine with a sports girl.

47:17.083 --> 47:21.020
Why can't I look after the girl?
You can, but I'd like to have talked to her.

47:21.055 --> 47:24.000
Maybe you could have talked to
Louie for a couple of minutes?

47:24.035 --> 47:26.001
I did! I said goodbye.

47:26.036 --> 47:30.036
Out on the track, Amy was
displaying all of the raw skill...

47:32.044 --> 47:35.092
.. that had won her a gold medal.
In my mind, she was brilliant.

47:40.044 --> 47:42.068
Whoa! Watch, watch, watch.

47:48.004 --> 47:49.969
Clap. No.

47:50.004 --> 47:52.993
Amy, you did it in...

47:53.028 --> 47:58.040
Now, bear in mind we've got
a 1:53.7, and a 1:50.8.

47:58.075 --> 48:00.020
These are the wet times. Yeah.

48:00.055 --> 48:03.080
You did it in 1:50.9.

48:05.072 --> 48:08.009
So, you're there.
I'm just disappointed about that.

48:08.044 --> 48:11.060
I think I do have to come back
and practise a little bit more.

48:11.095 --> 48:14.053
I'd be delighted if you came back.
Absolutely thrilled.

48:14.088 --> 48:17.012
When it's not raining.
Maybe you could use a faster car?

48:17.047 --> 48:19.013
Come back any time. Move in.
Practise constantly.

48:19.048 --> 48:25.080
With Amy gone, Jeremy decided
there was no reason to stay.

48:28.028 --> 48:34.000
So, I sat down to wait
for the real Angelina.

48:34.035 --> 48:35.052
Just give it another hour.

48:42.076 --> 48:45.056
She was so stunning. She is.
Louie is a nice guy.

48:46.044 --> 48:49.052
Let me ask, let me ask.
Did she turn up? Yep! Really?!

48:49.087 --> 48:52.001
No. No, I didn't think she would.

48:52.036 --> 48:56.041
Anyway, I'd now like you to
have a look at this motorcycle.

48:56.076 --> 49:01.076
Now, I know it's not a motorcycle, OK?
But the Government says it is.

49:01.111 --> 49:06.012
They say that because it only has
three wheels, it's not a car.

49:06.047 --> 49:10.037
And as a result, you save
L55 a year on your tax disc.

49:10.072 --> 49:13.993
Now obviously, the best way
of exploiting this loophole

49:14.028 --> 49:17.080
is to take a wheel off your car and
drive round on the other three,

49:17.115 --> 49:19.101
but we don't recommend that.

49:19.136 --> 49:21.088
So is there another way?

49:32.052 --> 49:34.004
This is a Reliant Robin.

49:35.076 --> 49:39.977
On the face of it, it's hard
to see how it ever caught on.

49:40.012 --> 49:46.092
Even though it was made from plastic rather
than steel, it cost more when it was new
than a Mini.

49:49.036 --> 49:50.061
Catch on it did, though.

49:50.096 --> 49:54.076
The American Embassy in London
ran three as diplomatic cars.

49:54.111 --> 49:56.001
Princess Anne had one.

49:56.036 --> 50:01.024
Here in the North of England, it was
such a hit that by the middle of

50:01.059 --> 50:06.012
the 1970s, Reliant was the largest
consumer of glass fibre in Europe.

50:06.047 --> 50:09.053
Even to this day, this
remains the second best

50:09.088 --> 50:15.000
selling plastic car in history,
after the Chevrolet Corvette.

50:16.004 --> 50:22.088
Unlike other three-wheelers, the Reliant's
single wheel was at the front rather than
the back.

50:22.123 --> 50:27.000
I've always been rather worried that
this might have a profound effect

50:27.035 --> 50:28.096
on the handling.

50:32.024 --> 50:36.045
That's why I'm so scared about the
challenge which has been set for me today.

50:36.080 --> 50:47.033
I have to drive that car all the way
from here, on the outskirts of Sheffield,
to a pigeon loft here, in Rotherham.

50:47.068 --> 50:51.024
That's a distance of 14 miles.

50:53.072 --> 50:57.048
On the way, there will be many
perils such as roundabouts,

50:57.083 --> 51:03.076
pedestrian crossings,
pedestrians and traffic lights.

51:05.064 --> 51:07.993
That's why I'm wearing a helmet.

51:08.028 --> 51:10.045
It's also why I insisted the car
was fitted with a four-point

51:10.080 --> 51:18.000
safety harness, because I really
genuinely believe that what I'm about
to do is as dangerous as...

51:18.035 --> 51:22.072
Inviting you mum round for an
evening on Chat Roulette. Why?

51:27.056 --> 51:29.068
Here we go. Reliant Robin.

51:37.036 --> 51:41.036
Oh, no. I've crashed it.
I've crashed it almost immediately.

51:41.071 --> 51:43.545
I mean, literally, 20 feet.

51:43.580 --> 51:46.020
I can't get out, obviously.

51:46.055 --> 51:48.045
I'm completely stuck.

51:48.080 --> 51:54.052
Luckily, people in the North of England
are friendly and keen to help out.

51:54.087 --> 51:56.036
Excuse me!

51:58.028 --> 52:00.053
Excuse me...

52:00.088 --> 52:03.544
Oh heavens, look who it is!
It's Phil Oakey.

52:03.579 --> 52:07.000
Do you think you can push
me back on my wheels?

52:07.035 --> 52:09.028
Yeah, certainly. Thanks very much.

52:12.080 --> 52:14.008
Thank you, so much.

52:16.044 --> 52:20.084
Thank you very much, Phil Oakey,o
ut of the Human League! Pleasure.

52:22.036 --> 52:27.036
I suppose as a Sheffield boy, Phil
Oakey spent a lot of his youth

52:27.071 --> 52:30.965
putting Robin Reliants
back on their wheels.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.060
When he wasn't rescuing
waitresses from cocktail...

52:34.095 --> 52:38.053
Oh! Help!

52:38.088 --> 52:41.977
Again! Help!

52:42.012 --> 52:46.020
Where's Martin Fry out
of ABC when you need him?

52:50.044 --> 52:53.060
That's a... useful feature.

52:59.092 --> 53:04.036
In the early days, the
Robin had a 750cc engine.

53:05.056 --> 53:13.032
With 32 brake horse power on tap,
0-50 took 22 seconds. 0-60...

53:13.067 --> 53:14.997
wasn't really possible.

53:15.032 --> 53:21.068
In 1975 though,
Reliant fitted an 850cc engine.

53:21.103 --> 53:24.551
This improved the acceleration enormously.

53:24.586 --> 53:28.000
But the consequences were catastrophic...

53:35.060 --> 53:37.029
The lamppost!

53:37.064 --> 53:43.068
The big engine increase the top
speed too... It would now do 85.

53:43.103 --> 53:47.008
That was catastrophic as well.

53:50.048 --> 53:52.037
Not again!

53:52.072 --> 53:58.009
Oh no! I'm 50 years old.

53:58.044 --> 54:01.056
I'm on the side of a street in Sheffield.

54:05.020 --> 54:07.040
Oh, is that the sound of somebody?

54:07.075 --> 54:11.040
Hello? Peter Stringfellow!

54:14.008 --> 54:17.068
Were you just walking by, or...

54:17.103 --> 54:19.055
Nearly!

54:19.090 --> 54:20.973
Yes!

54:21.008 --> 54:24.032
Thank you so much, Peter Stringfellow
out of lap dancing clubs.

54:24.067 --> 54:27.048
My pleasure.
I can't thank you enough.

54:30.096 --> 54:37.044
To try and understand why the Robin
was so popular up north, I pulled
over to chat to some enthusiasts.

54:45.032 --> 54:47.044
How do you drive a Reliant?
Straight lines.

54:47.079 --> 54:49.013
You don't go round roundabouts.

54:49.048 --> 54:52.092
You get to it and you see where you're
coming off, and you go straight across.

54:52.127 --> 54:55.037
Try to avoid t'hill in t'middle.

54:55.072 --> 54:58.033
Cement on the passenger seat.
Cement?

54:58.068 --> 55:01.080
Sack of cement on t'passenger
seat belt, helps the balance.

55:01.115 --> 55:05.040
Why do you think Reliant
owners have big tool boxes?

55:05.075 --> 55:07.025
To weigh it down.
I was going to say...

55:07.060 --> 55:10.088
Your teeth, did you lose
these in a Reliant accident?

55:10.123 --> 55:12.017
You did, didn't you?

55:12.052 --> 55:16.037
Why do you think, everybody,
Reliants were so popular in t'North.

55:16.072 --> 55:21.033
The miners used them. But why?
Because they weremore expensive than Minis.

55:21.068 --> 55:27.060
Because a lot of miners originally
started with motorbikes, and they
didn't have a full driving licence.

55:27.095 --> 55:32.061
So to get out of t'weather in winter
when it were absolutely siling it down,

55:32.096 --> 55:37.028
they bought a Reliant. So it was just
because minersdidn't have a driving licence?

55:37.063 --> 55:40.076
Some of them. But other ones, also
in t'winter, with them being light,

55:40.111 --> 55:46.060
you'd get your normal car
stuck in t'snow or whatever.

55:46.095 --> 55:48.080
These just simply glide over top.

55:48.115 --> 55:50.981
Until you get to a corner!

55:51.016 --> 55:54.040
Well, long as you live somewhere
with a straight line to t'pit.

55:58.076 --> 56:02.001
Soon, I was back on my perilous journey.

56:02.036 --> 56:08.048
In this, it feels like I'm driving through
South Yorkshire in the 1970s, again.

56:10.032 --> 56:14.096
I grew up not far from here, so
did James May, for that matter.

56:17.044 --> 56:20.068
When I were a lad round 'ere,
all t'rich people, them as could

56:20.103 --> 56:24.021
afford four wheels on the
car, they all had Ladas.

56:24.056 --> 56:29.000
Lah-de-dahs we called them.
You didn't want to hit one of them,

56:29.035 --> 56:32.024
I'll tell you that for nowt,
they were built like tanks.

56:34.072 --> 56:37.096
One of the best ways to protect
your Robin was to lavish it with

56:37.131 --> 56:42.581
an exotic paint job, such as
this Starsky And Hutch homage.

56:42.616 --> 56:48.032
The idea was that having spent
many hours with the spray cans

56:48.067 --> 56:51.016
and the masking tape, you'd
drive more carefully.

56:51.051 --> 56:54.008
But this didn't always work.

57:01.056 --> 57:06.048
It really is a wonder how anyone
in the North survived the 1970s.

57:06.083 --> 57:09.029
Of course, a lot didn't.

57:09.064 --> 57:15.084
In 1971, the population
of Sheffield was 573,000.

57:15.119 --> 57:21.053
Since then,
it's dropped to just 513,000.

57:21.088 --> 57:27.965
Some of the lost 60,000
moved south, of course.

57:28.000 --> 57:33.096
But many, many, many more were
wiped out by their three-wheelers.

57:38.052 --> 57:45.040
Today, of course, most of the Robins
are gone and people up here drive
Kias and Hyundais instead.

57:45.075 --> 57:49.012
This means the local TV news
channel has to think of things

57:49.047 --> 57:53.012
other than Reliant crashes
to put in its bulletins.

57:59.020 --> 58:06.008
To Braithwell in South Yorkshire and
a blooming mystery that's baffling
it's green-fingered residents.

58:06.043 --> 58:08.088
Harry is there for us.
Harry, what's going on?

58:08.123 --> 58:10.025
Welcome to beautiful Braithwell.

58:10.060 --> 58:14.009
You can see the sun exploding
on a kaleidoscope of colour.

58:14.044 --> 58:18.080
I have to say, there has been a real
area of controversy here, because
over the last few days... My God!

58:24.012 --> 58:27.064
Are you all right, sir?
I'm getting used to it now, thanks.

58:27.099 --> 58:29.025
Thanks, very much.

58:29.060 --> 58:32.024
If you could just pop
me back on the wheels.

58:34.016 --> 58:36.013
Thank you, so much.

58:36.048 --> 58:39.096
Thank you, Harry Grayson,
out of Look North. Pleasure.

58:39.131 --> 58:41.048
Thank you, so much.

58:55.048 --> 58:58.981
The Reliant three-wheeler
soldiered on until 2001,

58:59.016 --> 59:03.024
but then with the mines gone,
the customer base dried up.

59:03.059 --> 59:05.025
And it was gone too.

59:05.060 --> 59:12.088
I don't know why Jasper Carrot ever thought
that this could be the basis for a joke.

59:12.123 --> 59:18.008
I don't know why we all laughed at Del
Boy's Reliant, because it wasn't funny.

59:18.043 --> 59:20.076
It was a complete menace.

59:28.072 --> 59:30.536
Oh, God!

59:30.571 --> 59:32.965
Oh, dear.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.009
Oh, dear. Look at the pitch.

59:35.044 --> 59:39.020
I'm very glad I've put
these safety things in.

59:40.088 --> 59:44.005
That's marvellous, thank you.
Oh yes, that's comfortable.

59:44.040 --> 59:49.092
Thank you, very much. That's Dickie Bird MBE
out of cricket umpiring here, he's not pleased.

59:49.127 --> 59:52.028
It's a cricket match on here!

01:00:01.096 --> 01:00:06.036
After this latest accident, I
decided to see if there was

01:00:06.071 --> 01:00:10.051
some way of correcting
the car's flawed design.

01:00:10.086 --> 01:00:14.032
I therefore found a
workshop and cued the music.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:22.024
Oh, God, I've driven
into the inspection pit.

01:00:22.059 --> 01:00:26.008
Soon though, the car was
out, and we set to work.

01:00:34.032 --> 01:00:38.045
What staggers me most of all is that
the Reliant was engineered and built

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:44.072
in Tamworth in Staffordshire, and
Tamworth over the years has produced
many, many brilliant men.

01:00:44.107 --> 01:00:50.064
It was a Tamworth man who captured one
of the Enigma coding machines from
the Germans in the war.

01:00:50.099 --> 01:00:55.088
It's a Tamworth man who
fronts The Teardrop Explodes.

01:00:55.123 --> 01:00:57.969
I mean, how many more do you want?

01:00:58.004 --> 01:01:03.040
So, how come no one in this town
of excellence was able to see

01:01:03.075 --> 01:01:07.044
that the Reliant could
be fixed in a trifle?

01:01:12.036 --> 01:01:14.977
How brilliant is this?

01:01:15.012 --> 01:01:16.977
It's still a three-wheeler.

01:01:17.012 --> 01:01:22.549
You still only pay motorcycle tax,
but now, thanks to these stabilisers...

01:01:22.584 --> 01:01:25.048
it can't roll over any more.

01:01:32.096 --> 01:01:35.021
I only had six miles of the journey left.

01:01:35.056 --> 01:01:38.064
But with my new anti-capsize
solution in place,

01:01:38.099 --> 01:01:41.068
I knew nothing could go wrong.

01:01:42.072 --> 01:01:45.064
And I knew that right up to the moment...

01:01:45.099 --> 01:01:46.597
when it did.

01:01:46.632 --> 01:01:48.356
Oh, my God!

01:01:48.391 --> 01:01:50.080
Oh, no!

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.088
Neck broken, and drowned.

01:02:08.596 --> 01:02:10.965
So...

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.032
You can save L 55 off your
annual motoring costs?

01:02:15.067 --> 01:02:16.001
Yes, you can.

01:02:16.036 --> 01:02:18.004
But you will be killed doing it?

01:02:18.039 --> 01:02:18.981
Yes, you will.

01:02:19.016 --> 01:02:23.084
And on that bombshell, it is time to end
what I think has been a very serious show.

01:02:23.119 --> 01:02:26.044
I think we should congratulate
ourselves on that.

01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:27.037
Very good work, well done.

01:02:27.072 --> 01:02:30.045
We'll see you next week for
more sensible buying advice.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:35.048
Thank you so much for watching and
do please remember, drive safely.
