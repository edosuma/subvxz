WEBVTT

00:02.649 --> 00:04.485
Once we clear Keasbey,

00:04.520 --> 00:07.659
it's a straight shot
down the Garden State Parkway

00:07.692 --> 00:09.596
until we hit the Pine Barrens.

00:09.630 --> 00:11.266
And let me tell you,

00:11.299 --> 00:13.604
the Pine Barrens is
some forest primeval shit.

00:13.638 --> 00:16.610
LASZLO: Sean has invited us
to his family's cabin

00:16.644 --> 00:18.346
in the New Jersey woodlands.

00:18.380 --> 00:20.552
-The Pine Barrens.
-Which is the same thing.

00:20.585 --> 00:23.591
-For a weekend hunting trip.
-NANDOR: We vampires

00:23.624 --> 00:25.160
do not hunt.

00:25.194 --> 00:26.697
Of course we fucking do.
We hunt humans.

00:26.730 --> 00:28.033
Does that count, though?

00:28.066 --> 00:29.503
SEAN:
Nothing wrong

00:29.536 --> 00:32.609
with a long weekend
away from the ladies.

00:32.642 --> 00:34.513
"We dem boys," am I right?

00:34.546 --> 00:37.051
-NANDOR: Yes.
-Indeed, but remember,

00:37.084 --> 00:38.788
Nandor and I need to be back

00:38.821 --> 00:41.392
no later than 5:00 a. m.
on Sunday.

00:41.426 --> 00:43.564
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You have jobs
at the railroad.

00:43.598 --> 00:45.334
You're like
a broken record, Laz.

00:45.367 --> 00:47.672
Yes, we them boys
who work at the railroad.

00:47.706 --> 00:49.275
SEAN:
You know,

00:49.308 --> 00:51.547
that kid looks like the spitting
image of Colin Robinson.

00:51.580 --> 00:53.383
It's like Little Baby Dilbert
over here.

00:53.416 --> 00:55.555
Well, as we mentioned before,

00:55.588 --> 00:58.260
Colin Robinson
is the child's uncle,

00:58.293 --> 01:01.266
so according to genetics,
that story makes perfect sense.

01:01.299 --> 01:02.836
SEAN:
Yeah, whatever. Hey, cornbread,

01:02.869 --> 01:04.438
what you playing back there?

01:04.472 --> 01:06.276
-Oh, no. What the fuck...
-Oh, it's a game called

01:06.309 --> 01:09.315
"Welcome to Bloxburg,"
and it's a game on Roblox

01:09.348 --> 01:11.520
and you can build your own house

01:11.553 --> 01:14.593
or get a job like a pizza maker
or woodcutter

01:14.626 --> 01:16.095
or insurance adjust...

Look at you.

-With the boys being away

01:56.510 --> 01:58.514
on this hunting trip with Sean,

01:58.547 --> 02:01.185
it is just so...
(chuckling) ...nice

02:01.219 --> 02:03.423
to have the house
to myself for a change.

02:03.456 --> 02:06.162
To ourselves. There's two of us.

02:06.195 --> 02:07.431
Oh, yes. Of course.

02:08.300 --> 02:10.404
It's really nice to have
the whole house to myself,

02:10.437 --> 02:11.907
for once.
(chuckles)

02:11.940 --> 02:14.713
Since Nandor, Laszlo, Nadja
and Baby Colin are all gone,

02:14.746 --> 02:18.353
I get to choose what I want
to do for a change.

02:18.386 --> 02:20.858
We really needed a break
from Laszlo, Nandor, Gizmo,

02:20.892 --> 02:22.428
and the small weird creature

02:22.461 --> 02:24.432
that clawed its way out of
the abdominal cavity

02:24.465 --> 02:26.937
of our deceased
former friend Colin Robinson.

02:26.970 --> 02:28.808
GUILLERMO:
It's rare that anyone
leaves me alone,

02:28.841 --> 02:31.647
so I'm gonna have my family
over tomorrow night.

02:31.680 --> 02:34.452
I've been putting it off
for, like...

02:34.485 --> 02:35.722
12 years?

02:37.324 --> 02:39.730
This house, it can be
a lot of male energy.

02:39.763 --> 02:40.732
NADJA:
Oh.

02:40.765 --> 02:42.502
I mean, duh.

02:42.535 --> 02:44.238
-(cackling)
-(playing magic flute)

02:44.271 --> 02:45.808
NADJA:
So while they're off
in the forest,

02:45.842 --> 02:47.478
we will be having
a good, old-fashioned

02:47.512 --> 02:48.781
sloppy girls' night at home.

02:48.814 --> 02:51.252
-NADJA DOLL : Yes.
-And you know,

02:51.285 --> 02:53.657
I think the weekend will be
very good for the boys, too.

02:53.691 --> 02:55.260
Did you want to help
with the bags?

02:55.293 --> 02:56.630
I wasn't planning to, no.

02:56.663 --> 02:58.801
-NANDOR: Okay, thank you.
-Thank you.

02:58.834 --> 03:01.272
NADJA:
Laszlo and Nandor have been
bickering a lot recently.

03:01.305 --> 03:03.476
You know, for the past
one or two or...

03:03.511 --> 03:05.213
actually, about 80 years.

03:05.247 --> 03:06.850
(playing flute)

03:06.884 --> 03:08.788
You want to help with the door?

03:08.821 --> 03:10.357
I wasn't planning to, no.

03:10.390 --> 03:12.327
-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you.

03:12.361 --> 03:13.731
NADJA:
It's good

03:13.764 --> 03:15.668
that they're going to have
a chance to reconnect.

03:15.702 --> 03:18.541
SEAN:
Put all the bags in there,
all right?

03:18.574 --> 03:19.408
Eesh.

03:19.442 --> 03:20.410
Now, that up there,

03:20.444 --> 03:22.682
I got that when I was 14.

03:22.716 --> 03:24.553
Took me nine shots,
but I got it.

03:24.586 --> 03:27.759
First time I ever saw
something die.

03:28.994 --> 03:30.732
But it wouldn't be the last.

03:32.635 --> 03:34.873
Well, marksmanship
clearly runs in the family.

03:34.906 --> 03:37.512
That's a very impressive
collection of firearms.

03:37.545 --> 03:39.783
Oh, yeah. Well,
it's mostly my granddad's.

03:39.816 --> 03:42.321
He started collecting them
when he bought the cabin

03:42.354 --> 03:44.458
from this Polish guy
he used to bowl with,

03:44.493 --> 03:45.928
you know, before the cataracts.

03:45.962 --> 03:48.634
It's always sad when a Polish
fellow gets cataracts.

03:48.667 --> 03:50.605
No, I think what Sean is saying

03:50.638 --> 03:52.408
is that his grandfather
got the cataracts,

03:52.441 --> 03:54.245
which is why he could
no longer do bowling

03:54.278 --> 03:55.447
with the Polish fellow.

03:55.480 --> 03:56.683
SEAN:
Actually, the problem was...

03:56.717 --> 03:58.019
LASZLO:
No, no, hold on, Sean. No.

03:58.052 --> 04:00.992
The Polish fellow
got the cataracts,

04:01.025 --> 04:03.329
ending his bowling career,

04:03.363 --> 04:04.633
cutting his income,

04:04.666 --> 04:07.004
forcing him to sell
this cabin, clearly.

04:07.037 --> 04:08.607
NANDOR:
The problem with Laszlo

04:08.641 --> 04:10.912
is that he cannot admit
that there's something

04:10.945 --> 04:12.515
that even he does not know.

04:12.549 --> 04:14.719
He thinks that he knows
all things.

04:14.753 --> 04:16.924
And if there's one thing
I cannot abide,

04:16.957 --> 04:20.430
it is someone
who's a know-it-all-things.

04:20.464 --> 04:23.336
-Actually...
-If I could just
take a moment, Sean,

04:23.369 --> 04:25.407
I know a thing or two
about fellows,

04:25.440 --> 04:27.411
and I would say
it is more than likely

04:27.444 --> 04:28.681
that the Polish fellow

04:28.714 --> 04:31.887
went bowling
with other fellows for fun

04:31.920 --> 04:34.291
and not for his livelihood.

04:34.325 --> 04:36.362
LASZLO:
Nandor's problem is

04:36.395 --> 04:39.503
he has a bird-sized brain
in a mammoth-sized body.

04:39.536 --> 04:40.938
-Wouldn't you say?
-(screeches)

04:40.972 --> 04:43.878
Well, you see, that theory
betrays an ignorance...

04:43.911 --> 04:46.783
-Oh...
-...for the many Polish fellows
that have done very well

04:46.817 --> 04:49.523
vis-à-vis bowling
competition money.

04:49.556 --> 04:50.858
Agree to disagree.

04:50.892 --> 04:52.495
Boy, do your thing.

04:52.529 --> 04:56.670
Hey, Siri, search "Polish
bowlers top cash prize earners."

04:56.703 --> 05:00.043
SIRI (over iPad):
Okay, I found this on the web
for "bowling Polish

05:00.076 --> 05:01.445

05:01.479 --> 05:02.916
-Check it out.
-LASZLO: Yes?

05:02.949 --> 05:07.391
It's a Wikipedia page
for someone called Daria Pajak.

05:07.424 --> 05:08.761
Read the page.

05:08.794 --> 05:11.533
"Daria Pajak is a professional
bowling player

05:11.567 --> 05:13.069
-from Poland..."
-LASZLO: From Poland.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.475

05:23.156 --> 05:24.425
Right.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.661
COLIN:
So, what are we doing?

05:25.695 --> 05:27.932
Time for a little hunting
of our own.

05:27.966 --> 05:29.703
The most dangerous game--

05:29.736 --> 05:31.405
-hunting humans...
-The hunters become the hunted.

05:31.439 --> 05:33.644
Fucking hell.
Stop interrupting me.

experimenting

05:38.386 --> 05:39.956

05:45.501 --> 05:47.471
-COLIN: Hey, Lazzo, guess what?
-What?

05:47.505 --> 05:50.811
I need more Robux to buy
gamer wings for my avatar

05:50.845 --> 05:53.116
-because guess what?
-What?

05:53.149 --> 05:54.753
-I already have the Gamer Cloak.
-Enough.

05:54.786 --> 05:56.657
You're going to scare away
the humans.

05:56.690 --> 06:00.096
Silence is the hunter's
greatest weapon.

06:00.130 --> 06:01.833

I'm on eight percent.

to have a guy like Lasz

06:11.419 --> 06:12.855
-taking care of you.
-I guess.

06:12.889 --> 06:16.730
Sometimes I think that Lazzo
doesn't like me so much.

06:16.763 --> 06:18.701
Are you kidding me?
He loves you.

06:18.734 --> 06:20.972
He's always saying,
"I'm not gonna have you grow up

06:21.005 --> 06:24.044
to be a bald-headed,
energy-sucking bore."

06:24.078 --> 06:27.050
Huh, that's why my old man
wouldn't let me watch PBS.

06:27.084 --> 06:28.520
COLIN:
Do you think I'm boring?

06:28.554 --> 06:30.858
What? You got your little
computer pad,

06:30.892 --> 06:32.829
and a... stick.

06:32.862 --> 06:35.000
And a whole bunch of other
neat stuff, right?

06:35.033 --> 06:36.603
What else do you like doing?

06:36.637 --> 06:39.743
Well, I like to go
into the basement in the house

06:39.776 --> 06:43.517
and smash holes
into the wall with a hammer.

06:43.550 --> 06:45.487
Like, really hard.

06:45.521 --> 06:47.525
Just over and over again.

06:47.558 --> 06:49.763
Just smashing and smashing

06:49.796 --> 06:52.635
and smashing,
and I can't help it.

06:52.669 --> 06:54.071
It makes me feel good.

06:54.104 --> 06:56.777
But like, only walls, right?

06:56.810 --> 07:00.518
You don't like, uh... smashing
a person or something?

08:24.786 --> 08:27.725
Mira estos platos, qué lujosos.

08:27.759 --> 08:29.194
She's really impressed.

08:29.228 --> 08:32.200
¿Te dieron una promoción
en el Panera o qué?

08:32.234 --> 08:34.606
No, no, no, mamá.
Trabaja en el ferrocarril,

08:34.639 --> 08:35.875
¿recuerdas?

08:35.908 --> 08:36.943
VALERIA:
Oh, you're still
at the railroad.

08:36.977 --> 08:38.146
You're working at the railroad?

08:38.179 --> 08:39.616
Yeah, I work at the railroad.

08:39.649 --> 08:41.252
What happened to
the Panera Bread?

08:41.285 --> 08:42.722
Speaking of bread,
do you want some?

08:42.755 --> 08:44.693
-Oh, I got a promotion.
-That's right.

08:44.726 --> 08:45.828
You got a promotion?

08:45.861 --> 08:47.665
-Yeah.
-How does a fool

08:47.699 --> 08:50.971
get a promotion from
a Panera Bread to a railroad?

08:51.005 --> 08:52.709
-VALERIA: How does that happen?
-It was a...

08:52.742 --> 08:54.713
-It was at a train station.
-A train station?

08:54.746 --> 08:56.015
The Panera Bread was
at the train station.

08:56.048 --> 08:57.618
-MIGUEL: What train station?
-Penn Station.

08:57.652 --> 08:58.887
Nah, nah, nah. Sabes que, homie.

08:58.921 --> 09:00.758
There ain't no Panera Bread
at Penn Station.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.160
-It was a pop-up.
-(overlapping chatter
in Spanish)

09:02.194 --> 09:03.597
Pop-up shop.

09:03.630 --> 09:04.999
Wow.

09:05.033 --> 09:06.770
Slower, don't pull!

09:06.803 --> 09:08.974
(gasping)
Ooh, ooh! I have an idea.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.978
-What?
-Let's watch Mamma Mia!

09:11.011 --> 09:12.280
Uh, yes.

09:12.314 --> 09:14.652
NADJA:
Mamma Mia is
my favorite, favorite

09:14.686 --> 09:16.823
film to watch when
I am missing my homeland,

09:16.857 --> 09:20.063
but Laszlo never
lets me watch it. He says...

09:20.096 --> 09:21.900
(mimicking Laszlo): "My darling,
I can't watch that.

09:21.933 --> 09:23.604
"It reminds me
of all the bastard children

09:23.637 --> 09:26.108
I fathered when I was a human."

09:27.010 --> 09:28.580
SEAN:
Then the other two guys,

09:28.614 --> 09:30.651
they hear this screech
in the woods.

09:30.684 --> 09:32.855
And they hightail it
out of there,

09:32.889 --> 09:36.830
but they never found
the third guy...

09:37.698 --> 09:38.934
...because you know who got him?

09:38.967 --> 09:40.604
LASZLO:
The Jersey Devil.

09:40.638 --> 09:41.706
-NANDOR: The Jersey Devil.
-SEAN: Uh-huh.

09:41.740 --> 09:42.975
COLIN:
Hey, Mr. Rinaldi,

09:43.009 --> 09:44.712
-guess what?
-SEAN: What?

09:44.746 --> 09:46.750
I don't believe
the Jersey Devil is even real.

09:46.783 --> 09:48.119
SEAN:
All righty, then.

09:48.152 --> 09:51.025
I guess is not my fault
if he comes and eats you.

09:51.058 --> 09:53.831
Okay, well, if he's so real,
then what does he look like?

09:53.864 --> 09:56.636
He's got dragon wings,

09:56.670 --> 09:58.941
and a half-goat horse face

09:58.974 --> 10:01.613
with a chinstrap beard
like an Amish.

10:01.646 --> 10:03.817
And he's got hooves and horns,

10:03.851 --> 10:06.623
and two low-hanging balls

10:06.656 --> 10:08.961
with a button cock on top.

10:08.994 --> 10:10.631
(whispering):
Fantastic.

10:10.664 --> 10:13.269
And he creeps through
the Pine Barrens,

10:13.302 --> 10:17.845
looking for little kids
who don't believe in him.

10:17.879 --> 10:20.350
And he goes, "clomp, clomp,

10:20.383 --> 10:21.720
clomp!"

10:21.753 --> 10:23.422
-(gunshot)
-(all yelp)

10:23.456 --> 10:25.795
SEAN:
Uh... Everyone all right?

10:25.828 --> 10:28.734
I got to fix the safety
on that one, huh?

10:28.767 --> 10:30.203
No, the Jersey Devil
is not real.

10:30.236 --> 10:32.909
It is just a myth
that vampires made up

10:32.942 --> 10:35.915
to explain all the dead bodies
that we leave in the woods.

10:35.948 --> 10:38.787
Sean may be my best friend,
but like all humans,

10:38.821 --> 10:41.125
he doesn't realize
when he's been fucking had.

10:41.158 --> 10:43.196
Sean is your best friend?

10:43.229 --> 10:44.666
Yes. Why?

10:45.466 --> 10:47.003
No reason.

10:47.037 --> 10:49.742
Here's to spending
the weekend with you, Sean.

10:49.776 --> 10:50.744
I'll drink to that.

10:50.778 --> 10:52.314
Yes, cheers.

10:52.347 --> 10:54.819
There's just something special
about "guy time," you know?

10:54.853 --> 10:56.857
-LASZLO: Hear, hear.
-Yes.

10:57.457 --> 10:59.696
(crickets chirping,
owl hooting)

10:59.729 --> 11:01.398
-(Sean snoring)
-(iPad chiming)

11:01.432 --> 11:03.770
Sean, time to go beddy bye.

11:03.804 --> 11:05.106
-(slurring): Whatever.
-Here we go.

11:05.139 --> 11:06.108
I got a deer.

11:06.141 --> 11:06.943
Mind your head.

11:06.977 --> 11:08.981
-Ooh, that hurt.
-What are you doing?

11:09.014 --> 11:10.885
COLIN:
This is seriously

11:10.918 --> 11:12.755
the funnest level
I've ever done on Roblox.

11:12.788 --> 11:13.757
Is it as cool as this?

11:13.790 --> 11:14.959
NANDOR:
Careful, Laszlo.

11:14.993 --> 11:16.195
Take it from a soldier:

11:16.228 --> 11:18.032
That thing is a weapon,
not a toy.

11:18.065 --> 11:19.434
The last time you saw battle

11:19.468 --> 11:21.907
it was just swords
and wooden clubs.

11:21.940 --> 11:23.844
I'd hardly call you
an authority.

11:23.877 --> 11:26.015
-(mimics sheep bleating)
-(iPad chimes)

11:26.048 --> 11:27.818
(Laszlo laughs maniacally)

11:27.852 --> 11:30.791

11:36.503 --> 11:39.274

So, uh, I'm gonna go
and get one. Anyone else?

11:40.878 --> 11:42.180
-No, I'm good.
-Nah.

11:42.214 --> 11:43.850
Do you want me
to pause it or...?

11:43.884 --> 11:45.119
Oh, no, don't worry.
I'll only be a moment.

11:45.153 --> 11:47.090

Oh. Hello.

12:05.828 --> 12:07.163
-(gasps) Whose this, Guillermo?
-The maid.

12:07.197 --> 12:08.266
I'm Nadja of Antipaxos.

12:08.299 --> 12:09.869
I'm rich now, so I have...

12:09.903 --> 12:11.272
I have a maid.

12:11.305 --> 12:13.042
¿Es tu novia, no?

12:13.075 --> 12:14.846
-(soft chatter)
-Sí, sí, es que...

12:14.879 --> 12:16.115
Girlfriend? Since when?

12:16.148 --> 12:18.921
GUILLERMO: Yeah. I did say
Nadja was my girlfriend.

12:18.954 --> 12:21.191
The lies just pile up
on top of each other, you know?

12:21.225 --> 12:23.429
Over the years, you just
can't keep track. (chuckles)

12:23.462 --> 12:25.400
Isn't that right, Nadja?
You're both

12:25.433 --> 12:27.972
my girlfriend and...

12:28.907 --> 12:30.778
-...my maid.
-SILVIA: Wow.

12:30.811 --> 12:32.480
It all started, actually,
when my mom was trying

12:32.515 --> 12:34.351
to set me up with
her church friend's niece

12:34.384 --> 12:35.888
and just to get her off my back,

12:35.921 --> 12:38.259
I said I was dating Nadja.

12:39.328 --> 12:40.396
Please don't tell Laszlo.

12:40.430 --> 12:42.100
Es como Daphne y Niles.

12:42.133 --> 12:43.804
VALERIA:
Daphne wasn't the maid.

12:43.837 --> 12:46.041
She was Frasier's dad's
physical therapist.

12:46.075 --> 12:47.945
-Right?
-(indistinct chatter in Spanish)

12:47.979 --> 12:49.816
Nadja, acompáñanos, ¿sí?

12:49.849 --> 12:51.820
-Join us.
-Uh...

12:51.853 --> 12:53.189
SILVIA:
Por favor.

12:53.222 --> 12:55.226
Okay. (chuckles) Lovely.

12:55.259 --> 12:56.496
(Nadja laughing)

12:56.529 --> 12:59.301
VALERIA:
Guillermo, your girlfriend
was here this whole time,

12:59.334 --> 13:01.506
and you didn't invite her
to eat with your family?

13:01.539 --> 13:04.912
Yes, Guillermo can be a little
bit of a big rotten shit bag.

13:04.946 --> 13:06.950
-MIGUEL: (cackling)
¿Te llamó shit bag?
-Yeah.

13:06.983 --> 13:10.356
One of my many sweet little
cheeky pet names for him.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.193
My boyfriend and...

13:13.396 --> 13:15.501
-...boss. (clears throat)
-MAITE: Guillermo,

13:15.534 --> 13:17.571
¿me puedes enseñar
dónde está el baño?

13:17.605 --> 13:19.174
GUILLERMO:
Sí, claro, abuelita.

13:19.207 --> 13:20.844
-(chatter in Spanish)
-SILVIA: Nadja, hola.

13:20.878 --> 13:22.380
I am his mom.

13:22.414 --> 13:24.217
-Bienvenidos.
-Sí.

13:25.854 --> 13:27.324
Oh, sí, claro.

13:41.051 --> 13:43.890
GUILLERMO:
I mean, I guess I never
thought of it before,

13:43.924 --> 13:44.926
but, yeah, it makes sense.

13:44.959 --> 13:46.195
If I have Van Helsing DNA,

13:46.228 --> 13:48.600
then so would my grandma
and the rest of my family.

13:48.633 --> 13:50.136
Which makes it

13:50.169 --> 13:52.240
not-a-so good.

14:03.530 --> 14:05.299
Los goosebumps.

14:06.936 --> 14:08.940
(iPad chiming)

14:13.984 --> 14:15.386
LASZLO:
I haven't a clue who this

14:15.420 --> 14:17.323
Gena Lee Nolin is, but...

14:17.357 --> 14:19.294
I wouldn't mind that
in my lunch box.

14:19.327 --> 14:22.033
NANDOR:
I have a question, Laszlo.

14:22.067 --> 14:24.104
What did you mean
by what you said before?

14:24.137 --> 14:26.576
-What did I say before?
-About the pistol.

14:26.609 --> 14:28.547
You said I was hardly
an authority.

14:28.580 --> 14:30.149
LASZLO:
Well, exactly that.

14:30.183 --> 14:32.521
You haven't seen any action
in nigh on a millennium.

14:32.555 --> 14:35.393
Probably more accurate
to call you a former soldier

14:35.426 --> 14:37.130
than a real soldier,
wouldn't you say?

14:37.163 --> 14:41.238
I am and always will be
Nandor the Relentless.

14:41.271 --> 14:43.142
I suppose I should not
expect you to understand

14:43.175 --> 14:44.946
what it means to be a soldier.

14:44.979 --> 14:48.587
Were you not kicked out of your
Rifle Corps, your fancy-pants

14:48.620 --> 14:50.657
college for wealthy lads?

14:52.193 --> 14:53.964
I think you're
referring to Eton,

14:53.997 --> 14:55.934
and I told you that
in confidence.

14:55.968 --> 14:58.038
NANDOR:
Surprise, surprise.

14:58.072 --> 14:59.976
The talk suddenly
turns to Laszlo

15:00.009 --> 15:01.679
and he's put
his sticky mag down.

15:01.713 --> 15:03.449
I was listening to everything.

15:03.482 --> 15:05.587
It's just the same old,
shrill tune.

15:05.621 --> 15:07.223
NANDOR:
Sounds like someone's

15:07.257 --> 15:09.394
a little jealous he's not
the number one guy in the house.

15:09.428 --> 15:12.133
Says the guy who left
the house to "find himself"

15:12.167 --> 15:14.271
and come back
with his tail between his legs.

15:14.304 --> 15:16.609
That was an important step
in my personal journey.

15:16.643 --> 15:18.312
And a good thing I did come back

15:18.345 --> 15:20.517
since the house went to
piss-filled shit on your watch.

15:20.551 --> 15:23.422
You remember to watch your
language in front of my boy.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.527
Piss-filled shit house!

15:25.561 --> 15:26.930
Did you get that?

15:26.963 --> 15:28.365
-Yep.
-I shouldn't be surprised.

15:28.399 --> 15:31.506
All you ever do is lay about
or tinkle on your piano

15:31.539 --> 15:33.109
or have sex with Nadja

15:33.142 --> 15:34.579
wherever and whenever
you please!

15:34.612 --> 15:36.248
How is that an insult?

15:36.281 --> 15:39.555
Sounds to me like life goals
achieved, me old fruit.

15:39.589 --> 15:41.458
NANDOR:
You take and you take
and you take.

15:41.493 --> 15:43.362
You took the seat
in the Honda Element

15:43.395 --> 15:46.001
that wasn't behind Sean's seat
in the Honda Element,

15:46.034 --> 15:47.303
even though you know

15:47.337 --> 15:49.107
that Sean likes his seat
in the Honda Element

15:49.141 --> 15:50.276
pushed right far back,

15:50.309 --> 15:52.480
and I have the longer legs!

15:52.515 --> 15:55.019
♪ ♪

15:55.052 --> 15:58.259
Did you just
cock your weapon at me?

15:58.292 --> 16:02.233
I took that seat so I would have
a diagonal vantage point

16:02.267 --> 16:04.972
to talk to my friend Sean
fluidly.

16:05.006 --> 16:06.408
NANDOR:
I should've known.

16:06.441 --> 16:10.016
All the way back when we first
moved into the mansion

16:10.049 --> 16:12.187
and you had first pick
of the bedchambers,

16:12.220 --> 16:15.594
even though we all agreed
that I would have first pick!

16:15.627 --> 16:17.230
Now you're being absurd.

16:19.467 --> 16:20.637
What the fuck's that?

16:21.471 --> 16:24.645
"Whereas we
three vampires do agree

16:24.679 --> 16:29.054
"upon the following order
for the selection of bedchambers

16:29.087 --> 16:30.323
"on our new home

16:30.356 --> 16:32.495
on the rocky shores
of Staten Island."

16:32.528 --> 16:33.730
(chuckles)

16:33.763 --> 16:36.301
"First pick,
Nandor the Relentless."

16:36.335 --> 16:40.042
Well, suck on this. "Amendment:
In the absence of all

16:51.098 --> 16:52.467
NANDOR:
Unbelievable.

16:52.501 --> 16:54.605
You can't even stand to lose
an argument, can you?

16:54.639 --> 16:55.641
You know what you are?

16:55.674 --> 16:58.747
You are what my best friend Sean

16:58.780 --> 17:02.287
might describe
as a proper jabroni.

17:03.122 --> 17:04.659
Shit.

17:04.692 --> 17:05.794
I am not a jabroni.

17:05.827 --> 17:07.463
-You are jabroni!
-Jabroni.

17:07.498 --> 17:08.465
-Jabroni.
-Jabroni.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.369
-Jabroni.
-Jabroni.

17:10.403 --> 17:11.405
Jabroni.

17:11.438 --> 17:13.042
Ahh! Shit!

17:13.075 --> 17:15.079
Shit, you shot me
in the fucking hand.

17:15.112 --> 17:16.348
-Well, you would...
-NANDOR: Ow!

17:16.381 --> 17:18.185
SEAN: What the hell
is going on in here?

17:18.219 --> 17:19.454
I heard shots.

17:19.487 --> 17:20.456
No, you didn't.

17:20.489 --> 17:22.360
-Where's the kid?
-NANDOR: He was right there.

17:22.393 --> 17:24.498
-SEAN: Door's open.
-LASZLO: It's... Aw, shit.

17:24.532 --> 17:26.335
Oh, shit.

17:26.368 --> 17:27.337
(laughter)

17:27.370 --> 17:30.276
So you actually enjoy
to eat a bowl of fungus.

17:30.309 --> 17:32.514
-Voluntarily?
-All kinds of fungus.

17:32.548 --> 17:34.451
I'm not a "fun-guy."
(laughing)

17:34.484 --> 17:36.255
NADJA:
At first, I had no interest

17:36.288 --> 17:38.660
in pretending to be whoever
this Daphne person is,

17:38.693 --> 17:42.300
but I am loving Gizmo's family.

17:42.333 --> 17:44.237
You're so lovely and nice,
compared to...

17:44.271 --> 17:47.778
Oh, here he is,
my rotten little shit bag.

17:47.811 --> 17:49.447
-Come here.
-(laughing)

17:49.481 --> 17:52.086
I cannot believe that
such a group of fresh, dazzling

17:52.120 --> 17:54.659
moonbeams are related
to such a gray dud.

17:54.692 --> 17:57.498
Do all of you have a very bad
visions like Guillermo?

17:57.531 --> 17:59.635
'Cause I have heard
that the broken eyes

17:59.669 --> 18:01.104
can run in the families.

18:01.138 --> 18:02.574
No, no, no. I used to,
but then I got

18:02.608 --> 18:04.144
the laser treatment,
you know, that...

18:04.177 --> 18:05.379
(whistling) The Lasik.

18:05.413 --> 18:06.281
Lay-kips?

18:06.315 --> 18:08.218
-No. Lasik.
-Lipschitz.

18:08.252 --> 18:09.354
-(yelling) Lasik!
-(clattering)

18:09.387 --> 18:10.724
VALERIA:
Ay, Dios Santo. Cálmate.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.327
-That's what I said.
-MIGUEL: Sorry. I'm sorry.

18:12.360 --> 18:14.130
I didn't mean to yell
all like that.

18:14.164 --> 18:15.701
I don't know what came over me.
I just... you know. It's Lasik.

18:15.734 --> 18:18.272
-People know about this shit.
-Uh... So, anyway,

18:18.305 --> 18:20.476
in my family we don't
have the broken eyes,

18:20.510 --> 18:22.280
but all of the men have one arm

18:22.313 --> 18:23.817
quite a bit shorter
than the other arm.

18:23.850 --> 18:26.254
MIGUEL:
Fuck, is it getting hot in here?
Or is it just me?

18:26.288 --> 18:29.294
Miguel, will you let her
tell her fucking story?

18:29.327 --> 18:31.231
-Oh, oh.
-MIGUEL: Má.

18:31.264 --> 18:34.170
VALERIA: Please, go on.
Please, please.

18:34.204 --> 18:35.439
And so where-where was I?

18:35.473 --> 18:37.176
So the neighbors

18:37.210 --> 18:38.312
would shout at all the men,

18:38.345 --> 18:39.582
"Make your arms
the same length!"

18:39.615 --> 18:40.917
I'm fucking, like
about to catch on fire

18:40.951 --> 18:42.353
-or some shit.
-(Spanish chatter)

18:42.387 --> 18:43.823
MIGUEL:
Something's fucking wrong, Memo.

18:43.857 --> 18:47.163
(shrieks) Eres un monstruo
y debes de morir.

18:47.196 --> 18:48.833
What the fuck?!

18:48.867 --> 18:51.606
Demonio maldito chupa sangre,

18:51.639 --> 18:53.710
-aléjate de mi nieto.
-(clamoring)

18:53.743 --> 18:55.614
(Nadja screaming)

18:55.647 --> 18:57.584
Abuelita, abuelita.

19:02.928 --> 19:04.331
-Fucking hell!
-(clamoring)

19:04.364 --> 19:05.600
GUILLERMO:
Abuelita, abuelita.

19:05.634 --> 19:07.337
-(Nadja shrieks)
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:07.370 --> 19:08.873
(indistinct shouts)

19:08.907 --> 19:11.879
Why is there so much fucking
sharp wood in this house?!

19:11.913 --> 19:13.883
(overlapping shouts)

19:14.685 --> 19:16.756
GUILLERMO:
Nadja, I really have to tell you
something about my family!

19:16.789 --> 19:18.493
Yes, Guillermo,
I've put it together,

19:18.526 --> 19:19.929
-you bloody moron.
-GUILLERMO: ¡Mami, no!

19:19.962 --> 19:21.465

19:21.499 --> 19:23.235
Oh, my God, we're here
for a wedding...

19:23.268 --> 19:24.872

I think it's Pierce Brosnan.

19:24.905 --> 19:26.609

19:26.642 --> 19:28.613
-NADJA DOLL : Obviously.
-I hope he is,

19:28.646 --> 19:31.351
but I worry
there will be a twist.

19:31.385 --> 19:32.888
How long is this movie?

19:32.921 --> 19:34.257
GUILLERMO:
Nadja!

19:34.290 --> 19:35.794
You come into my house?

19:35.827 --> 19:39.434
Do you have any idea who
the fuck you are messing with?

19:39.467 --> 19:41.906
-(yelling in Spanish)
-Never mind.

19:42.674 --> 19:44.545
Don't hurt her!

19:44.578 --> 19:45.914
MAITE:
¡Demonio!

19:45.947 --> 19:48.252

19:48.285 --> 19:49.722
Stop, stop, stop, stop,
don't hurt her!

19:49.755 --> 19:51.458
No, Mami. No, no, no!

19:51.492 --> 19:53.663
Guillermo, ella es un monstruo,
peligroso, malvado.

19:53.697 --> 19:55.767
Yes, I know, I know, okay?
I know she's a vampire.

19:55.801 --> 19:58.372
I've always known.
Nadja lives in this house.

19:58.405 --> 20:00.677
Okay? And so do
another group of vampires.

20:00.711 --> 20:03.248
-And I don't work
at the railroad.
-(shushes)

20:03.282 --> 20:04.652
I work for them.

20:04.685 --> 20:06.388
-(groans)
-I work for the vampires
who live here

20:06.421 --> 20:08.727
because I hope to become
a vampire myself one day.

20:08.760 --> 20:11.431
-(gasps)
-And Nadja is not
my girlfriend...

20:12.433 --> 20:14.705
...because I'm gay.

20:14.739 --> 20:16.542
Aw.

20:17.845 --> 20:20.015
-(sighs) Mijo.
-Wait.

20:20.049 --> 20:21.418
You want to be a vampire?

20:21.451 --> 20:22.588
NADJA:
Hey!

20:22.621 --> 20:24.759
Being a vampire is very cool.
(hisses)

20:24.792 --> 20:26.829
We don't give a shit
about you being gay.

20:26.863 --> 20:28.265
We've known that forever,
I mean...

20:28.298 --> 20:29.568
-Yeah, we knew that.
-Una madre sabe.

20:29.602 --> 20:31.572
-Una madre sabe.
-Really? Everyone knew?

20:31.606 --> 20:32.841
-MIGUEL: Come on, Mo.
-¿Todos?

20:32.875 --> 20:34.277
Familia es familia, homie.

20:34.310 --> 20:35.981
(whoops)
I was so worried because I...

20:36.014 --> 20:38.485
-We love you.
-Oh, mami, gracias.

20:38.520 --> 20:39.955
(laughing)

20:39.989 --> 20:41.826
-Oh, gracias.
-(Nadja hisses)

20:41.859 --> 20:43.897
-No, wait, she's gonna try
to kill you.
-Ay!

20:43.930 --> 20:46.602
Come out, Baby Colin Robinson.

20:46.636 --> 20:48.773
-LASZLO: Nandor.
-Oh, Baby Colin Robinson!

20:48.807 --> 20:51.746
Nandor, look, I-I didn't mean
to hurt you. I...

20:51.779 --> 20:53.983
You shot me.

20:54.017 --> 20:55.453
See?

20:55.486 --> 20:57.056
LASZLO:
No, I shot at you, it's true.

20:57.089 --> 21:00.296
But you've been a fucking pill
this whole trip,

21:00.329 --> 21:01.431
and for no good reason.

21:01.465 --> 21:03.703
Maybe I did have a reason,

21:03.736 --> 21:04.839
which was...

21:04.872 --> 21:06.976
I was a little upset

21:07.009 --> 21:10.015
thinking about "guy time,"

21:10.049 --> 21:12.320
how we don't have it so much,
you and I.

21:12.353 --> 21:13.923
We used to.
Now you're always

21:13.957 --> 21:15.594
clinking beers with Sean

21:15.627 --> 21:19.735

with the Baby Colin Robinson.

21:19.768 --> 21:21.471

as well you know.

21:25.045 --> 21:26.616
I'll be brief.

21:26.649 --> 21:28.920
My feelings aren't
too dissimilar to your own.

21:28.953 --> 21:30.356

Just hypnotize them, okay?

Hypnotize them
so they forget everything.

23:45.794 --> 23:47.497

they're my family.

you're my family, Nadja.

I so rarely care
what Guillermo thinks

23:52.641 --> 23:53.743
or feels or says or does,

23:53.776 --> 23:55.145
but I know what it is like

23:55.179 --> 23:57.551
to watch your entire family
die in front of you.

23:57.584 --> 23:59.020
And it's not great.

23:59.053 --> 24:02.026
I watched my Uncle Andreas get
crushed to death by a donkey,

24:02.059 --> 24:03.563
and the donkey was his wife.

24:03.596 --> 24:05.767
And then she, the donkey,
died of alcoholism.

24:05.800 --> 24:08.906
And now I have had no real
family for hundreds of years.

24:08.940 --> 24:10.944
Also, if Guillermo
doesn't have a family,

24:10.977 --> 24:12.914
is he going to start
calling me "mami"?

24:12.948 --> 24:14.918
Bad enough his relationship
with Nandor, so, no, thank you.

24:14.952 --> 24:15.920
(retching)

24:15.954 --> 24:16.922
Okay, fine!

24:16.956 --> 24:18.693
-But on one condition.
-Anything.

24:18.726 --> 24:20.930
Keep Nandor, Laszlo,
and the small Colin creature

24:20.964 --> 24:23.101
away from the house
at least one night a month

24:23.135 --> 24:24.772
so I can have it to myself.

24:24.805 --> 24:25.406
And...

24:25.439 --> 24:27.978
obtain for me a copy of...

24:32.086 --> 24:34.525

that everything worked out.

24:34.558 --> 24:35.894
And that my family is safe.

24:35.927 --> 24:38.933
And that they were hypnotized
and now the house will be safe.

24:38.966 --> 24:40.837
Most importantly,
I'm just glad that

24:40.870 --> 24:43.075
they finally know
the truth about me.

24:43.108 --> 24:45.212
Well, besides the bit about you
working at the railroad.

24:45.245 --> 24:46.214
Okay, yeah.

24:46.247 --> 24:47.617
And the giant bit

24:47.651 --> 24:49.220
about you being desperate
to be a vampire.

24:49.253 --> 24:50.824
Okay, yeah, but Nadja made sure

24:50.857 --> 24:52.961
that they remember
the part about me...

24:52.995 --> 24:55.667
telling them that I'm gay, so...

24:55.700 --> 24:56.736
NADJA:
I mean,

24:56.769 --> 24:57.971
who isn't gay?

24:58.005 --> 24:59.073
A lot of people.

24:59.107 --> 25:00.275
Oh, okay.
(whoops)

25:00.309 --> 25:02.113
I'll get the trumpets out.
Sorry.

25:02.146 --> 25:04.551

Shade.

NANDOR:
After we vanquished
the Jersey Devil, we drove home

25:07.724 --> 25:09.962
-before sunrise.
-No, I drove.

25:09.995 --> 25:11.966
We hypnotized Sean, but
I'm worried that we fucked him.

25:11.999 --> 25:13.970
-Oh, you can make a pizza tree?
-Uh-huh.

25:14.003 --> 25:16.842
SEAN:
I just made ten Robux.
What's the street value to that?

25:16.876 --> 25:19.581
NANDOR:
But we did manage
to bring home a little

25:19.615 --> 25:21.251
