WEBVTT

00:06.607 --> 00:07.708
That's me. Jane Quimby.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.610
My life is a little
complicated right now.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.682
I landed
my fashion dream job
working for her,

00:11.682 --> 00:12.683
Gray Chandler Murray.

00:12.683 --> 00:15.015
The only problem,
they think I'm an adult.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.787
Now I am juggling
two secret lives,

00:16.787 --> 00:20.020
one in high school
and one in high fashion.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.452
Two months
is a long time.

00:21.452 --> 00:22.623
What if Billy's different?

00:22.623 --> 00:24.225
What if he doesn't
want to see me?

00:24.225 --> 00:26.157
BEN: You two
will figure it out.
You know why?

00:26.157 --> 00:27.528
You guys are like this.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.660
Jane, I see you've
met my nephew, Eli.

00:29.660 --> 00:32.703
Yeah, we... Nephew?

00:32.703 --> 00:35.806
I'm pleased to introduce
our newest designer,
Eli Chandler.

00:40.171 --> 00:42.313
That's a "no"
on kissing at work.

00:42.313 --> 00:43.644
You and I both know

00:43.644 --> 00:46.147
that someone on the inside
would like to see us fail.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.718
I can't do this anymore.

00:47.718 --> 00:53.154
Remember. We must
impress this Harrods
style director at any cost.

00:54.285 --> 00:55.686
Hello, losers.

00:56.387 --> 00:57.428
Where's Jane?

01:12.603 --> 01:15.846
Hey, guys.
What's going on?

01:15.846 --> 01:16.807
Hello, Jane.

01:19.610 --> 01:22.153
Don't get me wrong.
While I

01:22.153 --> 01:24.415
adored my time
here at Donovan Decker,

01:24.415 --> 01:27.688
I have taken
rather quickly
to Harrod's.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.320
And they to me.

01:29.320 --> 01:31.362
Which is why I've been given
complete creative control

01:31.362 --> 01:34.665
over your collaboration
with my store.

01:34.665 --> 01:38.169
I wish I could say
that you're all capable
of Harrod's caliber,

01:39.400 --> 01:40.771
but you're going to
have to prove it.

01:42.473 --> 01:45.476
Keep in mind, of course,
that I will be very,

01:45.476 --> 01:47.708
very thorough.

01:47.708 --> 01:50.681
Now, in addition
to supervising
the new collection,

01:50.681 --> 01:53.614
I will also be
overseeing
your contribution

01:53.614 --> 01:55.716
to its newest,
celebrity face.

01:55.716 --> 01:56.847
Who is that?

02:08.699 --> 02:09.830
Oh, my God, it's...

02:09.830 --> 02:11.562
Aiden Chayse.

02:11.562 --> 02:13.904
I'd like you to
meet your design team
here at Donovan Decker.

02:13.904 --> 02:15.566
How y'all doing?

02:15.566 --> 02:16.667
Who's Aiden Chayse?

02:16.667 --> 02:18.339
Are you kidding me?
Blasphemy.

02:18.339 --> 02:20.140
As I'm sure
you're all aware,

02:20.140 --> 02:23.143
Aiden is
Hollywood's most
promising young talent.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.745
He's on billboards
across the country

02:24.745 --> 02:26.877
and the bedroom
doors of girls
in every country.

02:26.877 --> 02:27.748
How'd I get there?

02:27.748 --> 02:28.749
(CARTER LAUGHING)

02:33.624 --> 02:35.926
And very soon,
our collection will be
right there with him.

02:35.926 --> 02:37.528
For the world to see.

02:37.528 --> 02:41.192
This is so cool.

02:41.192 --> 02:44.535
That is if I,
and Mr. Chayse,

02:44.535 --> 02:47.738
of course,
approve what
you've come up with.

02:47.738 --> 02:49.540
It's up to you
to impress.

02:49.540 --> 02:50.941
Don't let us down.

02:54.305 --> 02:56.447
JANE: Mr. Chase,
so nice to meet you.

02:58.849 --> 03:00.611
Something you'd
like to say, Gray?

03:01.882 --> 03:06.557
India. You were
one of my top designers.

03:06.557 --> 03:09.460
You know what it takes,
the hours, the hard work,
that they put in

03:09.460 --> 03:11.222
to get here.

03:11.222 --> 03:13.264
Now I realize that
you're still angry,

03:14.795 --> 03:18.198
but treat them
with respect.

03:18.198 --> 03:22.373
I am living proof that
hard work doesn't merit
respect in your eyes,

03:22.373 --> 03:24.675
so save me the
noble leader crap.

03:27.378 --> 03:29.209
Oh, and Gray?
What was it
that you used to say?

03:30.611 --> 03:32.243
Ah.

03:32.243 --> 03:33.784
I expect perfection.

03:42.793 --> 03:45.696
♪ I've my heart where
my head should be

03:46.957 --> 03:49.930

03:49.930 --> 03:53.664

Evil, secret leaking
sabotager India...

04:07.017 --> 04:09.620
Is the new Harrod's
style director. Yes.

04:09.620 --> 04:11.522
Bummer.

04:11.522 --> 04:13.424
Bummer?
This is like an asteroid
striking Earth, Billy.

04:13.424 --> 04:15.255
How big an asteroid?

04:15.255 --> 04:17.027
Just when I thought
things were starting
to calm down at work,

04:17.027 --> 04:18.959
India bursts in,
bitchier than ever,

04:18.959 --> 04:20.931
stomping around
in her stupid
Brian Atwood pumps.

04:20.931 --> 04:21.862
Which were
actually super cute,

04:21.862 --> 04:23.534
which only makes me
more annoyed.

04:23.534 --> 04:25.466
But, you know
what makes me
feel better?

04:25.466 --> 04:26.967
What?

04:26.967 --> 04:28.999
The thought
that tomorrow night
I'll be in a cemetery

04:28.999 --> 04:32.573
watching Creature From
the Black Lagoon with you.

04:32.573 --> 04:33.944
Are we really
going to that again?

04:33.944 --> 04:35.546
Come on! It's tradition.

04:35.546 --> 04:37.408
Don't you think doing
something every year

04:37.408 --> 04:39.880
sorta runs the risk
of, I don't know,
like, wearing it out?

04:39.880 --> 04:42.613
Um, no.
Are you worn out
on Thanksgiving?

04:42.613 --> 04:44.054
Or your birthday?

04:44.054 --> 04:45.356
Yeah, kinda.

04:45.356 --> 04:46.917
We've gone together
every year since
we were seven.

04:46.917 --> 04:48.889
We're not gonna
forgo tradition

04:48.889 --> 04:49.960
just because
you're feeling
a little bit grumpy.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.662
BOY: Lowlife.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.966
GIRL: He's a juvie loser.

04:55.966 --> 04:59.770
Yeah, I don't wanna
go anywhere that makes me
feel like I do here.

04:59.770 --> 05:02.002
Don't worry.
It'll be dark.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.734
(CHUCKLES)
People won't even
recognize you.

05:03.734 --> 05:06.006
(MOCK LAUGHTER)
Funny, Jane.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.478
Please come.

05:07.478 --> 05:09.540
It'll be fun.
You, me, a cemetery

05:09.540 --> 05:11.712
and I'll bring
extra Sour Patch Kids.

05:11.712 --> 05:12.913
All right, fine.

05:17.648 --> 05:18.949
What is this?

05:18.949 --> 05:21.522
This is Renny
the teddy bear.

05:21.522 --> 05:22.693
I combined our names

05:22.693 --> 05:25.926
in honor of our
eight week anniversary.

05:25.926 --> 05:29.059
I thought we did
the anniversary thing
last week, Ben?

05:29.059 --> 05:31.362
Did we?
I don't remember that.

05:31.362 --> 05:33.434
Yeah. We had
seven layer dip.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.666
You made us watch that
Brad Pitt movie, Se7en.

05:35.666 --> 05:38.008
Well, I didn't
make us watch it.
It's a great movie.

05:38.008 --> 05:39.770
Powerful ending.

05:39.770 --> 05:42.112
And the dip
was pretty amazing.

05:42.112 --> 05:44.645
Ben, look. I thought
we talked about this.

05:44.645 --> 05:47.778
I need us to
keep things professional
when we're at work, okay?

05:47.778 --> 05:49.079
Absolutely.

05:49.079 --> 05:52.082
The kids rely on me
to be a steady,
guiding influence.

05:52.082 --> 05:54.725
I can't be running around
with teddy bears

05:54.725 --> 05:57.688
and eating candy hearts
like a teenager in love.

05:58.729 --> 06:01.091
Say no more.
Loud and clear.

06:02.032 --> 06:04.094
And no candy hearts.

06:08.569 --> 06:11.001
Ah, special delivery.

06:11.001 --> 06:13.844
Scrap those,
we need to regroup.

06:13.844 --> 06:15.045
Okay. Hear me out on this.

06:15.045 --> 06:17.978
Rita said she wants
to keep things
"under the radar,"

06:17.978 --> 06:20.080
in the whole
romance department,

06:20.080 --> 06:22.553
but does she
really mean it?

06:22.553 --> 06:24.615
I'd go with
a "yes" on that.

06:24.615 --> 06:26.156
Yeah, normally,
even I'd say just go for it.

06:26.156 --> 06:28.058
But I think
Jane has a point.

06:28.058 --> 06:31.091
Right.
But every relationship
I've ever been in,

06:31.091 --> 06:33.724
hasn't worked out because
I didn't do enough.

06:33.724 --> 06:36.967
And I don't want that
to happen with Rita.
She's too special.

06:38.168 --> 06:40.871
I just want her to know
what she means to me.

06:40.871 --> 06:42.172
I think she knows.

06:42.172 --> 06:45.035
Yeah, you don't need
800 candy hearts
to tell her that.

06:45.035 --> 06:46.677
So cancel the
gorilla-gram?

06:47.808 --> 06:49.480
Is he serious?
No way.

06:50.981 --> 06:51.982
Cancel it.
Cancel it.

06:54.585 --> 06:57.818
A gorilla-gram?
(CHUCKLING)
I know.

06:57.818 --> 07:00.420
But it's so cute,
my brother's in love.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.123
Yeah, you know,
I guess I do
like them together.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.795
Me, too.

07:04.795 --> 07:06.196
All right. I'm out.

07:07.197 --> 07:08.729
Seriously?

07:08.729 --> 07:10.801
Yeah, I have to
get to work.

07:10.801 --> 07:12.663
I mean, I can stay.

07:12.663 --> 07:15.536
If you want me to stay.
Do you want me to stay?

07:15.536 --> 07:17.608
No, it's fine.

07:17.608 --> 07:20.140
Look,
If you need me to,
I totally will.

07:20.140 --> 07:24.214
No, you know, it's fine.
I'll just eat lunch
with Carl again.

07:24.214 --> 07:25.876
Carl?

07:25.876 --> 07:28.118
Carl,
the janitor, Carl?

07:31.181 --> 07:34.084
Look, I'll call in sick
and we can hang out.

07:34.084 --> 07:37.087
No. It's cool. Really.

07:37.087 --> 07:40.460
Okay, but only
if you're sure.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.162
Are we still on
for the movie
tomorrow night?

07:42.162 --> 07:43.093
Yeah.

07:44.194 --> 07:45.866
All righty, then.

07:48.539 --> 07:49.940
I'll see you tomorrow.

07:49.940 --> 07:51.201
Mmm-hmm.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.817
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

08:06.817 --> 08:11.722
PROFESSOR: The vertex
centroid is the intersection
of the two bimedians.

08:14.224 --> 08:15.596
Surprise, surprise.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.127
PROFESSOR: As with
the polygons,

08:17.127 --> 08:19.600
the X and Y coordinates

08:19.600 --> 08:21.171
of the
vertex centroid...

08:24.775 --> 08:26.106
Really, Harper?

08:26.106 --> 08:27.808
You seriously think
I'm gonna take your purse?

08:30.881 --> 08:32.242
Unbelievable.

08:34.885 --> 08:36.747
Hey, nobody panic,
all right?

08:36.747 --> 08:38.619
I want you all to know

08:38.619 --> 08:40.991
I've been completely
rehabilitated.

08:40.991 --> 08:42.853
Your valuables
will be safe and sound

08:42.853 --> 08:44.795
right where they are.

08:45.095 --> 08:46.957
Dude. Relax.

08:46.957 --> 08:49.900
Oh, thanks for
your input, Harper.

08:49.900 --> 08:51.862
Do I not look
relaxed to you?

08:52.903 --> 08:54.134
Mr. Nutter,

08:54.134 --> 08:55.906
when you've done
being disruptive,

08:55.906 --> 08:57.568
I'd like to get on
with the class.

08:57.568 --> 08:58.839
This is ridiculous.

08:58.839 --> 08:59.970
That's enough.

08:59.970 --> 09:01.842
I didn't do anything!

09:01.842 --> 09:03.644
Office. Now.

09:04.274 --> 09:05.545
Wow.

09:14.885 --> 09:16.787
I know what
you're thinking.

09:16.787 --> 09:18.789
Is that right?

09:18.789 --> 09:22.593
Yeah, you're thinking
Gray gave me this job
just because I'm her nephew.

09:22.593 --> 09:24.334
And you're still
a little upset because

09:24.334 --> 09:26.897
you feel like
you deserved the job
more than I do.

09:26.897 --> 09:30.971
Wow. Not bad.
No wonder she hired you.

09:30.971 --> 09:34.574
Look, I've never
actually been that
close with my aunt.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.648
That fact
actually helps less.

09:37.648 --> 09:38.879
(CHUCKLES) Jane.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.612
Look, I love design,
okay, I really do.

09:41.612 --> 09:43.253
And I'm good at it.

09:43.253 --> 09:44.985
So, the last thing I want

09:44.985 --> 09:46.957
is for you to
feel like this was
handed to me undeserved.

09:47.758 --> 09:48.819
Then prove it.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.061
I'm serious.

09:51.061 --> 09:53.223
Prove to me
that you deserve it.

09:53.223 --> 09:55.195
Well, I will.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.367
Well, you'll have
to do a whole lot
better than this, then.

09:58.128 --> 10:00.701
Amateur. Immature.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.372
Undisciplined.

10:02.372 --> 10:05.075
This is not
what Donovan Decker
is about, my friend.

10:05.075 --> 10:06.777
Maybe we should be.

10:06.777 --> 10:08.779
We?

10:08.779 --> 10:13.784
Yeah. Maybe it's time
this whole company
was a little less, uh...

10:13.784 --> 10:16.787
I don't know, stuffy?

10:16.787 --> 10:18.288
Did you just
call me stuffy?

10:18.288 --> 10:20.891
Oh, come on, man.
That cannot be the first
time you've heard that.

10:20.891 --> 10:24.224
Okay, boys.
Look, you're both
very handsome.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.096
And conservative
can be nice.

10:26.096 --> 10:28.058
As can
very casual T-shirts.

10:28.058 --> 10:31.231
So why don't we all
just agree to disagree here?

10:34.935 --> 10:36.306
This is gonna be fun.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.875
I know what
you're thinking.

10:44.875 --> 10:46.917
You're a mind reader? Cool.

10:46.917 --> 10:48.949
I'm not gonna
steal your purse.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.280
What's wrong
with my purse?

10:50.280 --> 10:51.982
Nothing. It's fine.

10:51.982 --> 10:53.924
If I was looking
to steal a purse,

10:53.924 --> 10:57.788
which I'm not,
yours would be the
first one I'd go after.

10:57.788 --> 10:58.989
You're just saying that.

11:01.031 --> 11:04.034
So what did you do?
Which time?

11:04.034 --> 11:06.436
Let's start with
the most recent one.

11:06.436 --> 11:08.799
I kinda lost it in class.

11:08.799 --> 11:09.870
Lost what?

11:11.271 --> 11:14.674
(SIGHS) My temper. My mind.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.147
I don't know.
What about you?

11:17.147 --> 11:19.980
I told my calculus teacher
I don't believe
in pop quizzes.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.212
Rebel.

11:22.212 --> 11:24.084
Too bad you're not
a mind reader.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.756
We almost had
something in common.

11:26.456 --> 11:28.288
Oh, so you read minds?

11:28.288 --> 11:29.359
Palms.

11:30.891 --> 11:31.922
Let me see your hands.

11:31.922 --> 11:33.063
Seriously?
Mmm-hmm.

11:36.366 --> 11:40.270
Nails trimmed.
No visible calluses.

11:40.270 --> 11:42.102
Definitely a moisturizer.

11:42.933 --> 11:44.875
Not into sports.

11:44.875 --> 11:47.808
And a loner,
but not entirely by choice.

11:50.841 --> 11:51.912
You just got out of juvie?

11:52.983 --> 11:54.414
Where does it say that?

11:54.414 --> 11:57.287
It doesn't.
I just heard it
from someone.

11:57.287 --> 11:59.249
So we're basically
just holding hands
right now?

11:59.950 --> 12:01.992
Sorry.

12:01.992 --> 12:04.394
Billy, you're up.
Zoe, do you mind if we discuss
your transcripts tomorrow?

12:04.394 --> 12:05.756
I'm kind of
swamped today.

12:05.756 --> 12:06.797
Definitely, Miss Shaw.

12:10.961 --> 12:12.833
Transcripts?

12:12.833 --> 12:14.935
Pop quiz crusader
sounded cooler.

12:24.074 --> 12:25.145
(EXCLAIMS)

12:33.523 --> 12:34.754
Billy.

12:35.225 --> 12:36.756
Miss Shaw.

12:37.928 --> 12:40.991
You're a good kid.
I know that.

12:40.991 --> 12:43.293
But the fact is,
you have some
strikes against you

12:43.293 --> 12:46.096
and you can't afford any
misbehavior right now.

12:46.096 --> 12:48.198
One unexcused absence,
one more time getting
sent down here, and...

12:49.139 --> 12:50.370
But it wasn't my fault.

12:50.370 --> 12:53.343
I know that, Billy,
but the judge only agreed

12:53.343 --> 12:55.275
to release you early
on the condition

12:55.275 --> 12:57.948
that he sees your
weekly progress reports.

12:57.948 --> 12:59.079
All it takes
is one slip up,

12:59.079 --> 13:01.051
and you could end up
back in Newhall

13:01.051 --> 13:03.013
and that could follow you
the rest of your life

13:03.013 --> 13:05.515
and I don't want to see
that happen to you. Do you?

13:07.117 --> 13:09.890
(SIGHS)
What's the difference?

13:09.890 --> 13:13.023
Difference is that
you are not that kid, Billy.

13:13.023 --> 13:15.495
I'm not giving up
on you here.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.267
You've got to
work with me, okay?

13:19.399 --> 13:20.901
Okay.

13:31.882 --> 13:33.143
Hmm.

13:42.592 --> 13:43.954
I have to say it's...

13:47.928 --> 13:49.129
It's not bad.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.062
I'm actually

13:52.062 --> 13:53.433
impressed.

13:53.433 --> 13:56.306
Thank you, India.
We're rather proud of it.

13:56.306 --> 13:58.068
You should be.

13:58.068 --> 13:59.469
Well. I'm going out
to greet Mr. Chayse.

13:59.469 --> 14:01.411
He should be
here momentarily.

14:01.411 --> 14:02.873
Excellent. We're ready.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.320
(CHUCKLING)

14:10.320 --> 14:12.122
Here you go,
non-fat latte.

14:12.482 --> 14:13.984
Mmm.

14:16.226 --> 14:17.457
Uh-uh.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.190
India.

14:23.033 --> 14:25.335
Okay, such a beautiful face
should never look so sad.

14:25.335 --> 14:26.536
What's the matter?

14:26.536 --> 14:28.168
I have to
apologize in advance.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.970
For what?

14:29.970 --> 14:32.272
I'm not gonna pretend
that you're gonna
love the collection.

14:32.272 --> 14:33.403
Oh.

14:33.403 --> 14:36.206
Because you probably won't.

14:36.206 --> 14:38.048
The Donovan team
wrapped a separate
account yesterday

14:38.048 --> 14:40.110
and that is clearly
where their focus has been,

14:40.110 --> 14:42.052
but I want you to know

14:42.052 --> 14:44.054
this is not how
we operate at Harrod's.

14:45.155 --> 14:46.356
Well, let's have a look.

14:46.356 --> 14:47.517
Okay.
All right.

14:50.020 --> 14:52.292
Of course if you like it,
we can move forward,

14:52.292 --> 14:55.996
but if you don't,
please don't hesitate
for a second to be vocal.

14:55.996 --> 14:59.629
Let's just say,
it'd mean more
coming from you.

14:59.629 --> 15:01.201
Fair enough.

15:01.201 --> 15:04.904
Mr. Chayse,
how are you?
Gray.

15:04.904 --> 15:08.008
We've come up with a line
that we think you're
really going to respond to.

15:11.141 --> 15:13.113
(WHISPERS) I think
it looks great.
Wow.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.090
This is...

15:22.092 --> 15:23.193
...a disaster.

15:25.695 --> 15:27.457
I'm really sorry,

15:27.457 --> 15:29.399
I can't put
my face on this.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.248
We're screwed.
Hold on a minute.
We're not screwed.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.051
He just came in here
and shot everything down.
How are we not screwed?

15:51.051 --> 15:53.183
Okay, let's just
think about it
for a minute.

15:54.524 --> 15:56.186
Okay.
Maybe we are screwed.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.528
Eli...
Let him go.

15:58.528 --> 16:00.490
Coward.
Aiden's on the phone
with his agents.

16:00.490 --> 16:02.062
Tell me we've got something.

16:03.433 --> 16:05.295
Don't everyone
jump in at once.

16:05.295 --> 16:07.467
We have...
Some seedlings.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.070
We just...
We don't need seedlings.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.402
We need
something that he likes
and we need it now.

16:12.402 --> 16:15.245
Well, it seems
Mr. Chayse wants to move
in a different direction.

16:15.245 --> 16:16.446
Meaning?

16:16.446 --> 16:19.179
Meaning you lost the
collaboration, Jane.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.251
Guys, look.
It's nothing personal,

16:21.251 --> 16:24.384
I just think,
creatively, this might
not be the best fit.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.286
You should
never compromise.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.258
Well, I appreciate it,
thanks.

16:32.422 --> 16:33.763
Actually, Mr. Chayse.

16:33.763 --> 16:35.425
If you wouldn't mind
taking a look at this,

16:35.425 --> 16:37.597
it's a slightly
different direction.

16:39.169 --> 16:40.330
Sure.

16:45.235 --> 16:46.276
GRAY: (WHISPERING)
What are you doing?

16:46.276 --> 16:48.678
It's a side project
I've been working on.

16:48.678 --> 16:50.180
Figured it can't hurt
to show him, right?

16:50.180 --> 16:51.681
He was walking
out of here, anyway.

16:51.681 --> 16:53.683
We have nothing to lose.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.096
This is fantastic.

17:08.428 --> 17:09.559
What do you guys think?

17:09.559 --> 17:12.602
You look amazing.

17:12.602 --> 17:13.733
Good enough
for a billboard?

17:15.205 --> 17:17.337
Perfect for a billboard.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.668
It's magnificent.

17:18.668 --> 17:20.470
Well, thank you.

17:23.773 --> 17:25.415
You saved us.

17:27.277 --> 17:28.778
We need to talk.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.224
Sit down.

17:38.228 --> 17:39.789
I said sit down.

17:41.831 --> 17:43.293
I know what
you did, Jeremy.

17:47.467 --> 17:48.538
How did you find out?

17:48.538 --> 17:50.800
I had security
cameras installed.

17:50.800 --> 17:53.072
I've seen everything.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.345
And I mean everything.

17:55.345 --> 17:58.408
I'm so sorry, Gray.
And you should be.

17:58.408 --> 18:00.350
Do you think this is
how I wanted to find out

18:00.350 --> 18:02.212
that you and India were

18:02.212 --> 18:04.554
an item?

18:04.554 --> 18:07.687
(STUTTERING)
And when were the
cameras installed exactly?

18:07.687 --> 18:09.859
Eight months ago.
Eight months?

18:09.859 --> 18:11.691
Right.

18:11.691 --> 18:14.594
Everywhere?
Everywhere.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.527
We had fun.
Yeah, we're adults.

18:17.527 --> 18:22.372
This is true.
And while I find your
transgressions to be vile,

18:22.372 --> 18:25.175
and in some states illegal...

18:25.175 --> 18:26.336
You have cameras
in the copy room?

18:26.336 --> 18:27.807
And audio.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.779
But I'm
beginning to think

18:29.779 --> 18:32.111
this could actually
do us some good.

18:32.111 --> 18:35.415
Clearly, nothing positive
can come from that woman
being in this office.

18:35.415 --> 18:38.348
Her presence here gives her
power to work against us.

18:38.348 --> 18:41.491
Which is why
I want you to smooth
things over with India.

18:41.491 --> 18:43.393
Get close to her again.

18:43.393 --> 18:44.624
Find out
what she's up to.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.657
Are you asking me to...

18:47.657 --> 18:51.561
I'm saying,
do what you need to do.

18:51.561 --> 18:56.466
Well, I'm sorry, but yeah,
I'm a little busy with the
Harrod's collaboration, and...

18:56.466 --> 18:57.907
Eli can handle that.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.213
That'll be all.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.320
You...

19:16.586 --> 19:18.388
So they walk me
into the back room
of the Roosevelt,

19:18.388 --> 19:20.330
mind you, I still think
I'm just going to meet Leo,

19:21.331 --> 19:22.592
and out of nowhere,

19:22.592 --> 19:25.495
a hundred people
jump out screaming
"Happy birthday."

19:25.495 --> 19:27.166
Was Leo really there?

19:27.166 --> 19:30.340
Of course he was.
He's a great guy.

19:30.340 --> 19:32.802
Ah, that's so nice to hear.

19:32.802 --> 19:36.446
Then they bring out
this huge birthday cake,
and it's great,

19:36.446 --> 19:38.308
but the whole time,
I'm thinking,

19:38.308 --> 19:40.510
"God, I wish
Scarlett was here."

19:40.510 --> 19:42.312
We'd just finished
the movie and she'd
left for Paris,

19:44.484 --> 19:46.185
and I missed her.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.517
Aw.
Aw.

19:47.517 --> 19:49.259
This is all
going through my mind,

19:49.259 --> 19:51.321
I bend down to
blow out the candles,

19:51.321 --> 19:53.523
and out of the cake
pops Scarlett.

19:53.523 --> 19:54.724
No.
I couldn't believe it.

19:54.724 --> 19:56.226
That is so cute.

19:56.226 --> 19:57.567
It was amazing.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.470
(SIGHS)

20:00.470 --> 20:01.971
I wish it had
lasted with her.

20:13.813 --> 20:16.646
We're famous
by association.

20:16.646 --> 20:17.517
Own it, girl.

20:21.551 --> 20:22.752
Jane, has anyone
ever told you,

20:22.752 --> 20:24.754
you have an
Audrey Hepburn quality?

20:24.754 --> 20:25.855
Totally.

20:25.855 --> 20:27.727
Oh, no, I...

20:27.727 --> 20:29.559
You do.
It is uncanny.

20:30.760 --> 20:33.002
That's so nice, Mr. Chayse.

20:33.002 --> 20:34.734
Call me Aiden.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.636
Thank you, Aiden.

20:36.636 --> 20:40.410
In her time,
Audrey had this
certain authenticity

20:40.410 --> 20:41.971
that you just
don't see these days.

20:41.971 --> 20:46.546
It's so refreshing
to spend time with
someone so real.

20:47.577 --> 20:49.619
Real as can be.

20:49.619 --> 20:51.781
I mean, all you guys,
you're just so much more

20:51.781 --> 20:53.683
grounded than all
my Hollywood friends.

20:54.484 --> 20:55.525
Thanks, man.

20:56.786 --> 20:58.728
Hey, what happened
to the other guy?

20:59.529 --> 21:01.561
British? Bit uptight?

21:01.561 --> 21:02.962
Yeah, that's the one.

21:02.962 --> 21:07.697
Yeah. He had
something pressing to
handle back at the office.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.544
I can still
see you, Jeremy.

21:16.746 --> 21:18.948
Hello, India.

21:18.948 --> 21:20.810
How's life been
treating you?

21:20.810 --> 21:24.684
You mean, life since
I was unjustly fired
and kicked to the curb?

21:24.684 --> 21:26.756
It's been spectacular.

21:26.756 --> 21:29.018
Just spectacular.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.521
Buzz off, Jeremy.

21:37.527 --> 21:39.329
Thank you
so much, Aiden.

21:39.329 --> 21:42.402
You guys took me out.
Thank you.

21:42.402 --> 21:43.533
REPORTER: Hey,
over here, Aiden.

21:44.504 --> 21:45.905
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)

21:48.878 --> 21:50.480
WOMAN: Over here, Aiden.

21:52.382 --> 21:53.583
Hey, who's that
girl with Aiden?

21:53.583 --> 21:55.715
I don't know.
But she's gonna be
famous tomorrow.

21:56.646 --> 21:57.747
MAN: All right.

22:05.725 --> 22:08.698
I thought we talked about
you being discreet, Jane.

22:09.459 --> 22:10.860
Hmm?

22:12.902 --> 22:16.335
(CHUCKLES) Oh, boy.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.968
Seriously?
This is not being careful.

22:18.968 --> 22:20.840
If you're gonna
live a double life,

22:20.840 --> 22:24.414
it's probably
a good a idea to try and
stay off of Perez Hilton.

22:24.414 --> 22:25.815
First of all, It's Perez,
and second of all,

22:25.815 --> 22:27.947
I'm sure nobody even
saw this picture.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.118
Although they did
get my good side.

22:30.380 --> 22:31.481
Jane.

22:31.921 --> 22:33.453
What?

22:33.453 --> 22:34.924
Did you cancel
the gorilla-gram?

22:34.924 --> 22:37.787
Yes. Don't try
and change the subject.

22:37.787 --> 22:40.460
You're not gonna
let this go to
your head, are you?

22:40.460 --> 22:42.061
It's just
part of my job, Ben.

22:42.061 --> 22:45.134
And I'm not going to let
some silly little picture
affect me.

22:51.671 --> 22:53.002
Can you believe it?

22:59.609 --> 23:02.512
Hey, Jane.
Hey, Harper.

23:02.512 --> 23:06.616
So, I was thinking
maybe we could do
lunch today? You in?

23:06.616 --> 23:09.058
Totally.
I love your glasses.

23:09.058 --> 23:10.820
Thanks, Harper.
That's so sweet.

23:14.724 --> 23:15.925
See you later, Jane.

23:16.996 --> 23:18.167
Hi.

23:19.499 --> 23:20.670
What's going on with you?

23:21.170 --> 23:22.802
What?

23:22.802 --> 23:25.034
What do you mean, what?
Hey, can I ask
you a question?

23:25.034 --> 23:27.977
Do you think I have an
Audrey Hepburn quality?

23:27.977 --> 23:30.179
A who... What?

23:30.179 --> 23:32.411
Jane?
Can I speak to you
a minute, please?

23:32.411 --> 23:33.513
Now.

23:41.491 --> 23:43.793
We need to talk, Jane.
We do?

23:44.594 --> 23:45.725
About this photo.

23:46.556 --> 23:48.458
Uh-huh, I know.

23:48.458 --> 23:50.530
I don't know
what to say.
Well, I just...

23:50.530 --> 23:53.563
You need to be
straight with me.

23:53.563 --> 23:55.434
Do you think you could
get me an autograph?

23:55.434 --> 23:57.807
I'm such a huge fan.

23:59.509 --> 24:01.140
Anything for you, Miss Shaw.

24:03.813 --> 24:07.046
JANE: So, then
he told them with
a completely straight face,

24:07.046 --> 24:08.718
"I don't need a parachute."

24:08.718 --> 24:11.981
(ALL LAUGHING)

24:11.981 --> 24:15.224
So, anyway, at this point,
Aiden thinks he's just
going to meet Leo.

24:15.224 --> 24:17.687
And he walks in and
like a hundred people...

24:17.687 --> 24:19.589
Like super famous
actor people,

24:19.589 --> 24:21.030
and they jump out
and surprise him.

24:21.030 --> 24:23.132
(ALL LAUGHING)

24:23.132 --> 24:24.494
HARPER: You were there?

24:24.494 --> 24:27.497
Well, not technically.
Oh, Billy!

24:31.571 --> 24:33.603
Uh, hang on
just a second.

24:34.904 --> 24:37.206
Hey.

24:37.206 --> 24:40.950
Oh, you've become
quite the celebrity
around here, huh?

24:40.950 --> 24:43.052
Please, me?

24:43.052 --> 24:45.515
Don't you have
work to get to?

24:45.515 --> 24:47.857
Of course not.
I took the day off.

24:47.857 --> 24:52.061
Oh, so, now you're too
cool for school and work?

24:52.061 --> 24:56.495
No, silly. I canceled.
For our movie night.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.497
Everyone is going.
It's gonna be super fun.

24:58.497 --> 24:59.929
Everyone?

24:59.929 --> 25:02.031
Jane!

25:02.031 --> 25:04.033
Oh, what time are you
picking me up?

25:04.574 --> 25:06.005
I'm not.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.837
What? Why?

25:07.837 --> 25:09.609
'Cause, I'm going alone.

25:09.609 --> 25:11.510
What are you
talking about?

25:11.510 --> 25:14.914
I'm talking about
me going alone
to the movie tonight.

25:15.945 --> 25:17.547
Why are you
being this way, Billy?

25:17.547 --> 25:19.048
I'm not being any way.

25:20.189 --> 25:23.653
I just want you
to have fun.
With everyone.

25:24.624 --> 25:25.855
Billy...

25:25.855 --> 25:27.196
I'll be fine.

25:27.196 --> 25:29.599
I just want
to be alone, okay?

25:39.268 --> 25:40.610
Rita Shaw?

25:41.540 --> 25:42.772
(SCREAMS)

25:45.975 --> 25:47.747
What are you
thinking, Ben?

25:47.747 --> 25:49.579
Rita, hold on,
I can explain.

25:50.079 --> 25:51.320
(ALL LAUGHING)

25:55.625 --> 25:57.086
I canceled you, man!

26:07.597 --> 26:08.838
(SIGHS)

26:09.699 --> 26:11.140
(DIALING)

26:13.643 --> 26:15.775
BILLY: Leave a message.

26:15.775 --> 26:17.947
I'm just going to
keep calling you.

26:17.947 --> 26:20.049
We can't not
go together.

26:20.049 --> 26:22.852
We've gone together
every year since we were kids.

26:22.852 --> 26:25.254
Just call me back.

26:27.657 --> 26:30.059
(PHONE RINGING)

26:30.059 --> 26:32.161
I knew you'd
change your mind.

26:32.161 --> 26:33.693
ELI: Uh, changed my mind
about what?

26:33.693 --> 26:36.095
Oh. Eli?

26:36.095 --> 26:38.728
Hey. What are you
doing right now?

26:39.669 --> 26:42.171
Hmm, nothing.

26:42.171 --> 26:43.803
Not anymore, you're not.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.635
We are going to a party.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.308
Uh, is that right?

26:49.308 --> 26:51.681
Yeah,
Aiden just invited us.

26:53.082 --> 26:56.285
It's, uh, VIP only,
and he wants us there.

26:56.285 --> 26:59.388
You and me.
Can you believe it?

26:59.388 --> 27:03.352
That sounds great,
but I can't.

27:03.352 --> 27:05.925
I mean,
I'd love to, I just...
(DOORBELL CHIMES)

27:05.925 --> 27:08.928
Right on cue.
Hey, open your door.

27:08.928 --> 27:10.730
What is going on?

27:16.635 --> 27:18.668
Your limo awaits.

27:18.668 --> 27:21.711
And I don't
want to go to
this party alone, so...

27:21.711 --> 27:23.372
You got anything
fancy to wear?

27:24.413 --> 27:26.746
I think I can
whip something up.

27:58.748 --> 28:00.109
You made it.
Hi.

28:01.911 --> 28:03.953
And you
look spectacular.

28:03.953 --> 28:05.885
Thank you.

28:05.885 --> 28:07.316
Uh, new suit?

28:07.316 --> 28:08.958
Why do you think
it's a new suit?

28:08.958 --> 28:10.720
You think
I don't own suits?

28:10.720 --> 28:12.992
Oh, no, no,
I'm sorry,

28:12.992 --> 28:14.994
I just... I assumed...

28:14.994 --> 28:17.066
Yeah, it's a new suit.

28:17.066 --> 28:18.097
(CHUCKLES)

28:18.898 --> 28:20.299
You look great.

28:20.299 --> 28:23.733
Thank you. I'm sorry
this is so last minute.

28:23.733 --> 28:26.275
No, I'm glad you called.

28:26.275 --> 28:28.978
So am I.

28:28.978 --> 28:31.911
Listen, I'm going
to go get a drink.
Can I, uh, get you something?

28:31.911 --> 28:33.382
I'm okay for now, thanks.

28:34.483 --> 28:37.146
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right here.

29:01.370 --> 29:03.172
(WHISTLING)

29:03.172 --> 29:05.174
(DOORBELL CHIMES)

29:05.174 --> 29:11.450
Are you ready for
a romantic movie night
and picnic under the stars?

29:13.953 --> 29:15.925
As ready as
I'll ever be.

29:15.925 --> 29:16.986
I thought
you were Rita...

29:16.986 --> 29:19.028
Uh, Miss Shaw.

29:19.028 --> 29:21.831
Dude. I saw her
in your T-shirt
the other morning.

29:21.831 --> 29:24.133
I think I can
handle hearing
you call her Rita.

29:24.133 --> 29:26.035
I thought you and Jane
left for the movie already?

29:27.196 --> 29:28.868
She's not here?
No.

29:28.868 --> 29:29.939
What's going on?

29:31.400 --> 29:33.142
I don't know.
She must've left.

29:33.142 --> 29:34.403
That doesn't
make any sense.

29:34.403 --> 29:36.245
Why would she
leave without you?

29:36.245 --> 29:39.949
Probably because
I told her I was going alone.

29:40.349 --> 29:42.351
And why is that?

29:42.351 --> 29:45.484
Because, Ben,
I'm a liability, okay?

29:45.484 --> 29:48.317
I'm the guy
people move their
purse away from now.

29:48.317 --> 29:52.021
It's exactly
how they used to
look at my brother.

29:52.021 --> 29:54.793
But, you know,
that's just who I am now,
and I have to get used to it.

29:54.793 --> 29:55.965
But Jane?

29:55.965 --> 29:57.997
She's starting to find
her place in school.

29:57.997 --> 30:00.369
Her star is rising
and mine?

30:00.369 --> 30:02.071
Well, it's crashing
and burning.

30:03.202 --> 30:04.303
Sit down.

30:04.303 --> 30:05.905
Oh, dude...
Now.

30:10.139 --> 30:13.112
Look, Ben,
I think it's better...
Stop talking and listen.

30:15.184 --> 30:16.986
You have to
get over this thing.

30:17.917 --> 30:21.120
I know
your brother, okay?

30:21.120 --> 30:24.123
You've never been like him,
you never will be.

30:25.494 --> 30:27.526
As far as everyone else
is concerned,

30:27.526 --> 30:30.099
people make
stupid assumptions,

30:30.099 --> 30:33.032
and it's really
up to you what you're
gonna do with that.

30:34.964 --> 30:37.136
I suggest, suck it up.

30:38.137 --> 30:40.239
You go get
yourself some candy,

30:40.239 --> 30:43.372
picnic blanket
and you go find Jane.

30:43.372 --> 30:47.176
Because you guys
have been a team for
as long as I can remember,

30:47.176 --> 30:49.218
and I'm not gonna
let you ruin that

30:49.218 --> 30:51.120
because you're going
through a tough time.

30:51.120 --> 30:54.183
You've always
been there for her.

30:54.183 --> 30:56.085
You need to let her
be there for you.

31:07.296 --> 31:09.538
You need to think
more global, youthful,

31:09.538 --> 31:11.240
you can't let Eli
own the new market angle.

31:11.240 --> 31:14.173
If you do,
you're dead
in the water here.

31:14.173 --> 31:17.106
I'm confused, India.
Are you here to
help me or sabotage me?

31:18.177 --> 31:20.249
I'm trying to help.

31:20.249 --> 31:24.153
I don't know why
I want to help you,
but I do.

31:24.153 --> 31:26.185
We're in
the same boat,
you and me.

31:26.185 --> 31:27.486
Is that right?

31:27.486 --> 31:30.089
You can't see it now,
'cause you're too close.

31:30.089 --> 31:32.621
But it's perfectly clear
what Gray's doing to you.

31:32.621 --> 31:34.193
And what might that be?

31:34.193 --> 31:37.226
She's turning her favor
and her focus towards Eli.

31:37.226 --> 31:40.069
It won't happen
all at once,
it'll be slow and steady,

31:40.069 --> 31:44.133
but I promise
it will happen.
It's already started.

31:44.133 --> 31:45.404
He won't last.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.406
(CHUCKLES)
He's her nephew.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.508
He's not
going anywhere.

31:49.508 --> 31:52.141
Whatever, all right?
I'm not worried
about some kid.

31:52.141 --> 31:55.084
Hmm. That's exactly
what I said about Jane.

31:55.084 --> 31:58.247
But as soon as
she was Gray's favorite
there was no place for me.

31:58.247 --> 32:00.249
What happened to you,

32:00.249 --> 32:01.450
it wasn't right.

32:01.450 --> 32:03.392
But it had nothing
to do with Jane.

32:03.392 --> 32:05.294
And what happens
with Gray,

32:05.294 --> 32:09.198
will happen
because of me,
if it happens at all.

32:09.198 --> 32:10.399
You don't get it.

32:11.460 --> 32:12.661
We're just
interchangeable pieces

32:12.661 --> 32:15.264
in Gray's
climb to the top.

32:15.264 --> 32:18.437
You don't want
what happened to me
to happen to you.

32:18.437 --> 32:23.312
Humiliated. Disgraced.
I've never felt so small.

32:25.474 --> 32:27.576
We walk into
the back room
at the Roosevelt.

32:27.576 --> 32:31.220
Now keep in mind,
I still think I'm just
meeting with Leo, right?

32:31.220 --> 32:35.284
When out of nowhere,
all these people jump out
and scream, "Surprise!"

32:35.284 --> 32:38.627
Yeah, it was like
a hundred people.

32:38.627 --> 32:42.731
The people...
And they were
behind the curtains,

32:42.731 --> 32:46.495
and other places.

32:51.600 --> 32:54.173
Anyway,
as I was saying...

33:02.351 --> 33:04.413
Having fun, huh?
Not really.

33:05.984 --> 33:10.189
This night, it's...
It's a total mess.

33:10.189 --> 33:12.121
Sorry about that.

33:12.121 --> 33:13.722
Oh, no,
that's not what I meant.

33:13.722 --> 33:17.596
You were the only
good part of it, Eli.

33:19.198 --> 33:21.200
It's just...
I realized this whole

33:21.200 --> 33:23.702
celebrity friend
thing it's...

33:23.702 --> 33:25.374
Yeah, it isn't real.

33:25.374 --> 33:27.376
No.
(CHUCKLES)

33:27.376 --> 33:31.210
And I have
a real friend.

33:31.210 --> 33:33.782
And I let him
push me away

33:33.782 --> 33:36.515
because I was so
swept up in all of this.

33:36.515 --> 33:39.348
I should really be
somewhere else tonight.

33:39.348 --> 33:41.120
For him.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.551
Well, the night's
not over, you know.

33:44.593 --> 33:46.295
What's stopping you?

33:47.296 --> 33:48.697
Get out of here.

33:56.105 --> 33:58.437
I am sorry, I know...

33:58.437 --> 34:02.141
Can we just not
talk about the
gorilla-gram anymore?

34:02.141 --> 34:03.442
Please?
No.

34:04.343 --> 34:05.714
I mean, yes.

34:05.714 --> 34:08.547
We can not talk
about it forever.

34:09.548 --> 34:11.120
Billy!

34:11.120 --> 34:12.781
You can come sit
with us if you want.

34:12.781 --> 34:15.654
Ben bought
enough popcorn to
feed everybody here.

34:15.654 --> 34:17.426
Uh, no, thanks, Miss Shaw,

34:17.426 --> 34:20.229
but I am looking
for Jane, actually.

34:20.229 --> 34:22.761
Totally.
You should do that.
Go surprise her.

34:22.761 --> 34:24.062
She's around here somewhere.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.195
Yeah.

34:27.396 --> 34:28.397
What? She is.

34:30.199 --> 34:31.640
Say what you like, India,
at the end of the day,

34:31.640 --> 34:34.243
you're here to
kill whatever
we come up with, right?

34:34.243 --> 34:35.474
I'm not here
for that, Jeremy.

34:35.474 --> 34:37.476
Then what are
you here for?

34:39.378 --> 34:40.409
I'm here for Gray.

34:41.550 --> 34:43.312
I'm going to ruin her.

34:43.312 --> 34:46.315
And I won't stop
until she's out
on the street

34:46.315 --> 34:48.417
with Jane
there beside her.

34:48.817 --> 34:50.419
India.

34:50.419 --> 34:53.122
I want them to crawl.

34:53.122 --> 34:56.665
Have you completely
lost your marbles?
Listen to yourself.

34:56.665 --> 35:00.399
No. You listen.
And listen very carefully.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.201
I'm going to
take down Gray and Jane.

35:02.201 --> 35:03.502
Once and for all.

35:03.502 --> 35:06.175
And you are going to
help me do it.

35:06.175 --> 35:07.536
And why would I do that?

35:07.536 --> 35:09.138
Because I know it was you.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.281
You, Jeremy,

35:13.312 --> 35:15.684
were the mole.

35:15.684 --> 35:19.288
You were the one
feeding Beau Braun
our ideas this whole time.

35:19.288 --> 35:21.450
You are the reason
I was fired.

35:21.450 --> 35:24.653
India...
And if you don't
help me take them out,

35:24.653 --> 35:26.595
I'm going to
take you down instead.

35:28.427 --> 35:31.260
We could run this place,
Jeremy. You and I.

35:31.260 --> 35:33.202
All of this
can be ours.

35:33.202 --> 35:37.766
No Jane. No Eli.
No Gray. Just you and me.

35:37.766 --> 35:39.608
Complete control.

35:41.440 --> 35:44.873
Well? What do you say?

35:53.482 --> 35:55.584
Did you do that
because you wanted to?

35:56.785 --> 35:58.587
Or because Gray
told you to keep me close?

35:59.888 --> 36:01.490
Does it matter?

36:03.362 --> 36:04.693
Not really.

36:15.844 --> 36:17.546
Ben...
Hold on.

36:29.458 --> 36:30.489
(SNEEZES)

36:34.263 --> 36:36.625
Oh, my God,
that is uncomfortable.

36:42.301 --> 36:43.602
Ben, we need to talk.

36:44.873 --> 36:47.906
All right.

36:47.906 --> 36:53.712
These last few weeks,
I couldn't ask for
anybody more

36:53.712 --> 36:55.714
attentive.

36:55.714 --> 36:58.747
And I really,
really appreciate it

36:58.747 --> 37:00.549
but it's a little
too much.

37:00.549 --> 37:02.251
The flowers, the bear...

37:02.251 --> 37:03.292
Renny.

37:04.553 --> 37:06.825
The giant ape-man
in my office.

37:06.825 --> 37:10.299
I swear to you, Rita,
I canceled that.

37:10.299 --> 37:12.701
I'm just a bit
overwhelmed, Ben.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.704
Okay.

37:15.704 --> 37:17.736
I just think
we need to slow
things down a bit.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.508
That's all.

37:19.508 --> 37:21.740
Look.

37:21.740 --> 37:25.974
I realize I might
come on a little strong.

37:25.974 --> 37:30.248
But that's just because
I care about you

37:30.248 --> 37:32.851
and I want to make
sure you know that.

37:34.723 --> 37:38.427
So, I'm sorry,

37:41.560 --> 37:43.662
but I don't want
to slow things down.

37:46.495 --> 37:47.596
I do.

37:49.668 --> 37:51.370
I don't.

37:53.942 --> 37:58.677
Then I'm not sure
where this leaves us.

37:59.878 --> 38:01.650
I think...

38:02.551 --> 38:03.682
What?

38:05.414 --> 38:07.956
I think we need
to take a little break.

38:45.894 --> 38:47.055
Hey.

38:47.055 --> 38:49.998
Hey yourself.
I thought that was you.

38:49.998 --> 38:52.761
You creature-featuring
solo tonight?

38:52.761 --> 38:56.865
I was. That is
unless you're down
for some creature action.

38:56.865 --> 38:58.707
I don't know about that.

38:58.707 --> 39:01.339
I usually prefer
my solitude for this
sort of thing.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.442
(CHUCKLES)
Don't stay
on my account.

39:04.373 --> 39:05.814
It's okay.

39:05.814 --> 39:07.746
I'm in it
for the Sour Patch Kids.

39:09.848 --> 39:12.681
So what do you
wanna know about me?

39:12.681 --> 39:14.923
How long have you
been at Whitemarsh?

39:14.923 --> 39:16.855
Long enough to know
that you were in prison.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.788
Okay, It wasn't prison.
It was a juvenile
detention center.

39:19.788 --> 39:21.530
Super scary.

39:21.530 --> 39:24.633
I mean, it's not like
it was a country club.

39:24.633 --> 39:25.864
No, I wasn't
allowed to leave.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.836
There were some bad guys.

39:27.836 --> 39:29.698
Were you one of them?

39:29.698 --> 39:30.869
Depends on who you ask.

39:31.570 --> 39:33.872
Here. Take my hand.

39:34.473 --> 39:35.804
Okay.

39:35.804 --> 39:37.776
Now tell me
what you observe.

39:37.776 --> 39:39.508
Just give me a fact.

39:39.508 --> 39:41.780
It can be any
random fact you notice.

39:41.780 --> 39:44.513
This is weird.

39:45.954 --> 39:47.656
Okay, okay.

39:47.656 --> 39:48.957
Um...

39:49.918 --> 39:51.760
Your fingers
are extremely cold.

39:52.661 --> 39:55.624
What else?
Hmm.

39:57.125 --> 39:59.498
You have unusually
tiny knuckles.

39:59.498 --> 40:01.500
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

40:01.500 --> 40:03.832
Now make
two statements
about me.

40:03.832 --> 40:05.704
One based on
what you observed,

40:05.704 --> 40:07.806
and the other
just on instinct.

40:08.907 --> 40:11.780
You like to do cartwheels.

40:11.780 --> 40:15.884
And you're nervous
to be at a new school

40:15.884 --> 40:18.747
because you think
no one can relate.

40:28.897 --> 40:31.630
So, how'd I do?

40:31.630 --> 40:33.862
Beginner's luck.
Oh, come on.
I nailed it.

40:33.862 --> 40:35.704
Oh, is that right?
Yeah, it is.

40:35.704 --> 40:37.836
Okay. Okay. (CHUCKLES)

41:25.684 --> 41:27.155
I changed my mind.

41:28.717 --> 41:31.660
Billy's over there
if you want to sit with him.

41:31.660 --> 41:34.162
Yeah, I didn't
want to interrupt.

41:34.162 --> 41:36.525
Looks like he's, uh,
made a new friend.

41:38.697 --> 41:39.798
How are you two doing?

41:41.169 --> 41:43.632
Fine, I guess.

41:43.632 --> 41:46.935
Just, uh, trying to
get back to normal.

41:46.935 --> 41:49.678
Back to the way
things used to be.

41:49.678 --> 41:51.940
And what about that
whole "it's you" thing?

41:51.940 --> 41:53.181
You ask him
what it meant?

41:54.042 --> 41:55.243
Yeah.

41:57.245 --> 41:58.947
Didn't get the answer
you wanted?

41:59.988 --> 42:03.722
Honestly, I'm not sure
what answer I wanted.

42:04.993 --> 42:07.656
All I know is,

42:07.656 --> 42:11.229
I saw my
best friend laughing
for the first time

42:11.229 --> 42:13.101
since he's been back

42:14.903 --> 42:16.565

a really good thing.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.568
