KIND OF BUSY.

09:49.156 --> 09:52.660

10:11.645 --> 10:14.281
YOU'RE ONE OF THE BRIGHTEST

AND I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU
AT ONE OF MY LECTURES.

AT MED SCHOOL.

I WANT TO GO TO MED SCHOOL?

YOUR MAJOR?

10:24.391 --> 10:26.526

A GIRLFRIEND...

10:31.932 --> 10:33.934

ON THE PAPER.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.321
THERE'S NO NEED
TO DENY IT.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.456
I'M SURE A STUDENT
OF YOUR PERSPICACITY

10:56.489 --> 10:58.826
MUST BE UNCHALLENGED
BY INTRO TO NEUROPSYCH.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.293

11:00.327 --> 11:02.696
DISPLAYS A BRILLIANT GRASP
OF THE SUBJECT.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.331
I'D LOVE TO HEAR MORE

11:04.364 --> 11:06.533
ABOUT YOUR ALTERNATIVE VIEW
OF THE MIND-BODY LINK.

11:07.701 --> 11:10.203

11:13.206 --> 11:15.008
YOU DIDN'T WRITE THIS,
DID YOU?

11:17.210 --> 11:19.179
NO, SIR.
I BOUGHT IT.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.714
WHO FROM?

11:20.748 --> 11:22.482
RUMOR IS
HE'S A GRAD STUDENT,

11:22.515 --> 11:24.417
BUT I DON'T KNOW
THE DUDE'S NAME.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.153
THEN HOW'D YOU
GET THE PAPER?

11:26.186 --> 11:29.489
A GUY ON THE TEAM
GAVE ME AN E-MAIL ADDRESS.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.325
I SENT THE ASSIGNMENT
AND 200 BUCKS THROUGH PayPal.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.195
AND A COUPLE DAYS LATER, THE
ESSAY SHOWED UP IN MY E-MAIL.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.867

I-I'VE NEVER CHEATED BEFORE.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.701
OH, COME ON.
I'VE SEEN YOUR GRADES.

YOU'VE BEEN GETTING A FREE PASS
AROUND HERE.

11:43.971 --> 11:46.106
BUT NOT THIS TIME,
NOT FROM ME.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.441
I SWEAR,
I USED TO BE A GOOD STUDENT.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.678
[ SIGHS ]

11:51.711 --> 11:53.680
I CAN'T CONCENTRATE
ANYMORE.

HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
FEELING LIKE THAT?

11:56.149 --> 11:59.586
I DON'T KNOW.
PRETTY MUCH ALL SEMESTER.

12:02.689 --> 12:05.692
LOOK ME
STRAIGHT IN THE EYE.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.331
YOU SEE THIS?

12:11.364 --> 12:13.666
SEE THE DISPARITY
IN PUPIL SIZE?

12:13.700 --> 12:14.968
IT'S ANISCHORIA.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.870
WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

12:16.904 --> 12:20.140
HAVE YOU BEEN HAVING
TROUBLE BREATHING?

HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN PLAYING FOOTBALL?

12:27.280 --> 12:31.651
I MEAN, I STARTED PEE-WEE AT 8,
FULL CONTACT WHEN I WAS 9.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.553
HAVE YOU BEEN HIT
HARDER THAN USUAL LATELY?

12:33.586 --> 12:37.490
I MEAN, I ENDED UP
AT THE BOTTOM OF A DOG PILE

12:37.524 --> 12:40.093

AND MY HELMET FLEW OFF.

I'LL LOSE MY SCHOLARSHIP.

OR RISK PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.775

THERE'S NO SUCH THING

13:38.118 --> 13:39.752

13:41.121 --> 13:42.322
THEY DIDN'T.

THEN WHO LOCATED HIM?

IF I GET A SLAP ON THE WRIST,
IT'S WORTH IT,

THAT YOU MURDERED CHRISTINA.

OF ROLLING STONE

17:32.619 --> 17:33.586
BY THE TIME I WAS 25.

17:36.889 --> 17:37.657
NONE OF THAT

17:42.929 --> 17:44.564
SO YOU GOT DIAGNOSED,
AND YOUR DREAMS DIED.

17:44.597 --> 17:47.200
NO WONDER
YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE D.J.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.701
YOU WANTED TO FORGET

17:48.735 --> 17:51.904
EVERYTHING THAT YOU'D LOST

SKEWER ME WITH IT.

18:00.046 --> 18:02.249
LOOK AT WHAT
YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED

18:02.282 --> 18:04.251
IN SPITE
OF YOUR DIAGNOSIS.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.686
TOP OF YOUR CLASS
IN MED SCHOOL,

18:06.719 --> 18:09.856
YOU'VE WRITTEN SEVEN BOOKS,
WON THE DAVENPORT PRIZE.

18:09.889 --> 18:12.359
COMPARED TO WHERE
YOU COULD HAVE ENDED UP,

18:12.392 --> 18:14.394
YOU'VE TRULY CLIMBED
KILIMANJARO.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.229
SO I REPRESSED
MY TRAGIC PAST

18:16.263 --> 18:18.431
RATHER THAN CONFRONT
MY SHORTCOMINGS.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.099
HOW VERY FREUDIAN OF ME.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.769
TELL ME, FRAU DOKTOR,
IN YOUR HALLUCINATORY OPINION,

18:22.802 --> 18:25.938
WHY AM I BEING HAUNTED BY
THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST NOW?

18:25.972 --> 18:27.607
BECAUSE YOUR
UNRESOLVED ISSUES

18:27.640 --> 18:29.942
ARE KEEPING YOU FROM
DEALING WITH YOUR STUDENTS.

18:29.976 --> 18:31.578
I DEAL WITH MY STUDENTS
EVERY DAY.

18:31.611 --> 18:32.945
YOU LECTURE THEM.

18:32.979 --> 18:35.415
BUT EMOTIONALLY,
YOU'RE TOTALLY DISENGAGED.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.083
I'M A PROFESSOR,
NOT A WET NURSE.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.618
NOW, WHAT ABOUT
BRIAN CAHILL?

18:38.651 --> 18:41.120
HE HAD HIS FUTURE TAKEN AWAY
BECAUSE OF A BRAIN INJURY.

18:41.154 --> 18:43.089
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD
BE ABLE TO RELATE TO THAT.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.758
BUT, NO, YOU JUST MADE
THE DIAGNOSIS AND WALKED AWAY.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.795
HEY, I SAVED
THAT KID'S LIFE.

18:48.828 --> 18:51.631
BUT WAS THE LIFE YOU SAVED
THE ONE HE WANTED?

18:53.933 --> 18:55.568
Brian:
YOU ASKED TO SEE ME?

18:55.602 --> 18:59.472
I JUST...
WANTED TO APOLOGIZE.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.974
WHAT FOR?

19:02.008 --> 19:04.444
I WAS A LITTLE PERFUNCTORY
ABOUT YOUR DIAGNOSIS.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.912
I-I SHOULD HAVE
DONE MORE

19:05.945 --> 19:07.980
TO HELP YOU ACCLIMATE
TO YOUR CONDITION.

19:08.014 --> 19:10.650
HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO YOUR PARENTS?
I-I COULD CALL THEM.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.385
AH, NO. IT'S OKAY.

19:12.419 --> 19:13.986
I TOLD DEAN HALEY

19:14.020 --> 19:15.988
THAT YOUR INJURY WAS SUSTAINED
ON THE FIELD,

19:16.022 --> 19:17.757
SO YOUR SCHOLARSHIP

WHAT I THINK?

38:55.333 --> 38:58.236
IT'S NOT THE JOB...
OR THE DIVORCE.

38:58.269 --> 38:59.838
IT'S, UH...

38:59.871 --> 39:01.640
IT'S JUST THAT
I'M NOT THE GUY FOR YOU.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.875
TAKE CARE, KATE.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.489
WHAT'S THIS?

39:17.523 --> 39:19.357
UNIVERSITY CATALOG.

39:19.391 --> 39:22.160
ASTRONOMY, MUSIC THEORY,
MODERN ART...

39:22.193 --> 39:23.895
THE WORLD'S YOUR OYSTER.

39:23.929 --> 39:28.133
I'M NOT SURE
I'M GOING BACK TO SCHOOL.

39:32.804 --> 39:34.773
LISTEN --
LISTEN TO ME, BRIAN.

39:34.806 --> 39:38.376
WHEN I -- WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME...TOO.

39:38.410 --> 39:40.111
I WAS --

39:40.145 --> 39:43.715
I WAS LOCKED IN A HOSPITAL,
AND I THOUGHT MY LIFE WAS OVER.

39:46.084 --> 39:47.786
ALL MY DREAMS
WENT OUT THE WINDOW.

39:47.819 --> 39:50.756
WHAT DID YOU DO?

39:52.390 --> 39:55.060
I FOUND A NEW DREAM.

40:09.975 --> 40:11.643
CAME TO SAY GOODBYE.

40:11.677 --> 40:14.646
MY HALLUCINATIONS DON'T USUALLY
HAVE SUCH GOOD MANNERS.

40:14.680 --> 40:18.650
I'M GOING AWAY.
TIME TO TRAVEL, SEE THE WORLD.

40:18.684 --> 40:22.554
FIRST STOP IS AFRICA,
TO CLIMB KILIMANJARO.

40:22.588 --> 40:24.389
I'M SORRY YOU DIDN'T
GET TO GO.

40:24.422 --> 40:27.025
BUT, YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES PLAN "B"

40:27.058 --> 40:29.260
TURNS OUT
PRETTY GOOD, TOO.

40:29.294 --> 40:33.098
OUR AMBITIONS AND OUR DREAMS

40:33.131 --> 40:36.935
GIVE US A GLIMPSE
OF A BEAUTIFUL SOMEDAY.

40:36.968 --> 40:39.938
AND THEY CAN HELP US GET THROUGH

40:39.971 --> 40:42.474
A SOMETIMES
LESS-THAN-BEAUTIFUL TODAY.

40:42.508 --> 40:46.478
IT'S A TRICKY THING,
THOUGH, AMBITION.

40:46.512 --> 40:50.248
IT CAN BLIND US
TO THE PRICE OF SUCCESS.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.851
IT CAN CONSUME US,

40:52.884 --> 40:57.689
LEADING TO DANGEROUS
OBSESSIONS...

40:57.723 --> 41:00.992
OR EMPTY HEDONISM.

41:01.026 --> 41:03.128
BUT NO MATTER
HOW MUCH WE'RE FUELED

41:03.161 --> 41:07.132
BY THIS NATURAL
NEUROLOGICAL IMPULSE,

41:07.165 --> 41:11.002
AMBITION ISN'T CARVED IN STONE.

41:11.036 --> 41:13.872
DREAMS CHANGE.

41:13.905 --> 41:19.110
AND EVEN IF WE DON'T
GET TO CLIMB MOUNTAINS...

41:19.144 --> 41:22.213
THERE'S STILL A CHANCE
THAT WE CAN MOVE THEM.

41:22.247 --> 41:25.283
IN THE WORDS OF THOSE
OLD ENGLISH POETS,

41:25.316 --> 41:28.820
YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET
WHAT YOU WANT.

41:31.156 --> 41:33.291
BUT IF YOU TRY SOMETIME...

41:33.324 --> 41:36.061
YOU MIGHT FIND
YOU GET WHAT YOU NEED.
