WEBVTT

00:02.460 --> 00:03.378
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>

00:03.461 --> 00:05.630
IS RECORDED IN FRONT OF
A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:10.135 --> 00:12.345
- HEY.
SO CONGRATULATIONS.

00:12.429 --> 00:16.140
I HEAR YOU AND MAMIE SUE
MADE THE SECRET WORD FINALS.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.809
- I'M GONNA
HAVE TO FORFEIT.

00:17.892 --> 00:20.603
MAMIE SUE DROPPED OUT.
- WHY?

00:20.687 --> 00:22.772
- HER DAUGHTER'S
HAVING A BABY,

00:22.856 --> 00:27.235
AND SHE WANTS
TO "BE THERE."

00:27.318 --> 00:30.280
WHAT'S SHE GONNA DO,
CATCH IT?

00:30.363 --> 00:33.825
- SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT AGNES
BRATFORD AUTOMATICALLY WINS?

00:33.908 --> 00:36.077
THAT'D BE,
LIKE, FIVE YEARS IN A ROW.

00:36.161 --> 00:39.789
- I CAN'T STAND
WHAT A SMUG LOUDMOUTH SHE IS.

00:39.873 --> 00:43.251
THAT'S MY THING.

00:43.334 --> 00:44.794
- WELL,
SINCE YOU HAVE TO FORFEIT,

00:44.878 --> 00:46.755
MAYBE SHE'LL BE MORE GRACIOUS
THIS YEAR.

00:46.838 --> 00:49.132
- HELLO, LOSER.

00:49.215 --> 00:52.969
- HELLO, AGNES.

00:53.052 --> 00:56.431
- IT'S NOT THE SAME WITHOUT YOU
IN COMPETITION THIS YEAR.

00:56.514 --> 00:57.932
OH, WAIT, IT IS THE SAME.

00:58.016 --> 01:00.977
I WIN AGAIN.

01:01.060 --> 01:03.521
- BURN.

01:05.397 --> 01:09.944
- YOU KNOW, MONA, MY SECRET WORD
PARTNER AND DAUGHTER.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.071
PEAKED IN COLLEGE.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.615
- THERE WERE THINGS AFTER.

01:13.698 --> 01:15.492
THERE WAS A MAN ONCE.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.327
WE ALMOST HAD
A LIFE TOGETHER.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.121
- NOBODY'S INTERESTED, MONA.

01:20.205 --> 01:24.501
WELL, ELKA, I WILL MISS
BEATING YOU THIS YEAR.

01:24.584 --> 01:26.628
- OH, DON'T BE SO SURE.

01:26.711 --> 01:28.838
I HAVE A NEW PARTNER.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.006
- OH, WHO IS IT?

01:30.089 --> 01:32.008
- NEVER YOU MIND.

01:32.091 --> 01:35.512
HE OR SHE WILL BE THERE.

01:35.595 --> 01:36.888
- HE OR SHE?

01:36.971 --> 01:40.725
THAT CAN ONLY MEAN JOY.

01:40.809 --> 01:43.478
- I'M JUST SITTING HERE.

01:43.561 --> 01:45.730
- COME ON, MONA.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.733
- AT THE RISK
OF SOUNDING LIKE JOY,

01:48.817 --> 01:51.319
I NEED A PARTNER, FAST.

01:51.402 --> 01:54.364
- SERIOUSLY,
I'M JUST SITTING HERE.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.825
- ELKA,
I'LL BE YOUR PARTNER.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.660
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

01:58.743 --> 02:00.328
YOU AND GAMES?

02:00.411 --> 02:01.579
- OKAY, I KNOW
YOU'RE SKEPTICAL.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.832
BUT, ALSO AT THE RISK
OF SOUNDING LIKE JOY,

02:03.915 --> 02:07.168
I'M A WARM BODY
AND I'M YOURS FOR THE TAKING.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.211
- ALSO AT THE RISK
OF SOUNDING LIKE JOY,

02:09.294 --> 02:14.092
BUGGER THE [bleep] OFF.

02:14.175 --> 02:17.554
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I NEED TO TALK TO BOB.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.389
THANKS FOR MEETING ME.

02:19.472 --> 02:22.183
- WELL, JOY,
MEETING AFTER HOURS

02:22.267 --> 02:24.227
CAN ONLY MEAN
ONE OF TWO THINGS.

02:24.310 --> 02:27.021
EITHER YOU WANT MORE
THAN A WORKING RELATIONSHIP,

02:27.105 --> 02:29.607
OR YOU WANT TO BE LOVERS.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.401
- THAT'S THE SAME THING.

02:31.484 --> 02:34.070
- I DON'T THINK SO.

02:34.153 --> 02:37.240
- BOB, THIS HAS BEEN ONE
OF THE BEST JOBS I'VE EVER HAD,

02:37.323 --> 02:40.451
BUT I DON'T THINK I CAN STAY
AT THE DETECTIVE AGENCY.

02:40.535 --> 02:42.871
IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD
WORKING FOR A MAN

02:42.954 --> 02:45.373
WHOSE MARRIAGE PROPOSAL
I JUST TURNED DOWN.

02:45.456 --> 02:46.875
- OH, THAT?

02:46.958 --> 02:49.043
I BARELY EVEN REMEMBER
PROPOSING TO YOU,

02:49.127 --> 02:50.837
UNLESS THE ANSWER'S CHANGED.

02:50.920 --> 02:54.883
IN WHICH CASE, YOU'VE MADE
ME THE HAPPIEST MAN ALIVE.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.218
- LOOK, I'LL STAY WITH YOU
UNTIL WE FINISH THIS CASE,

02:57.302 --> 03:01.264
BUT THEN I'M GONNA
FIND A NEW JOB.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.932
- I UNDERSTAND.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.268
YOU'RE A GREAT DETECTIVE,
JOY.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.145
IT'S BEEN A PRIVILEGE
WORKING WITH YOU.

03:07.228 --> 03:12.150
- THANKS.

03:12.233 --> 03:14.777
- [sighs]
- HI, BOB.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.280
- EH, EH.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.449
- ARE YOU CHOKING?
BECAUSE I CAN'T SAVE YOU,

03:19.532 --> 03:21.284
EVEN THOUGH I PLAYED
JESSICA HEIMLICH

03:21.367 --> 03:22.952
IN THE LIFETIME
ORIGINAL MOVIE,

03:23.036 --> 03:24.913
<i>THE HEIMLICH MANEUVERS.</i>

03:24.996 --> 03:26.623
- NO, I'M NOT CHOKING.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.125
MY HEART IS BREAKING.
- OH, OKAY.

03:29.208 --> 03:32.837
SO, YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT MY NEW
HBO DETECTIVE SHOW, RIGHT?

03:32.921 --> 03:35.632
WELL, I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD
GO ON A RIDE ALONG WITH YOU?

03:35.715 --> 03:37.008
YOU KNOW,
AND JUST GET A TASTE

03:37.091 --> 03:38.968
OF WHAT REAL DETECTIVE WORK
IS LIKE.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.303
- SURE, I DON'T CARE.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.638
LIFE IS MEANINGLESS.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.473
JOY IS LEAVING ME.

03:43.556 --> 03:46.184
I HAD THE PERFECT FIVE TO TEN
YEAR PLAN TO WIN HER OVER.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.144
WHAT DO I DO NOW,
VICTORIA?

03:48.227 --> 03:51.439
WHAT DO I DO NOW?

03:51.522 --> 03:53.274
- PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER,
BOB.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.444
NOW, YOU'D NEVER SEE SIMON
OR MITCH WHINING IN PUBLIC.

03:56.527 --> 03:58.279
TRY BEING
A LITTLE MORE MANLY.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.822
- SERIOUSLY?

03:59.906 --> 04:03.493
MORE MANLY?

04:03.576 --> 04:06.037
[upbeat music]

04:06.120 --> 04:08.122
- ♪ BA-BA, BA-BA ♪

04:08.206 --> 04:10.166
♪ BA-BA, BA-BA ♪

04:10.249 --> 04:11.668

{\an8}MELANIE,
HERE'S THE SECRET WORD.

04:16.422 --> 04:18.173
{\an8}YOU GIVE HER
A ONE WORD CLUE.

04:18.257 --> 04:20.802
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, THIS IS EASY.

04:20.885 --> 04:23.721
{\an8}KETCHUP.
- MUSTARD.

04:23.805 --> 04:26.683
{\an8}- NO, NO, NO.

04:26.766 --> 04:31.729
{\an8}KETCHUUUUP.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.648
{\an8}- HAMBURGER.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.817
{\an8}- MELANIE,
THE WORD IS SALT.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.193
{\an8}- SALT?

04:37.276 --> 04:40.989
{\an8}WHAT THE HELL'S
THE MATTER WITH YOU?

04:41.072 --> 04:42.365
{\an8}- THAT'S A GREAT CLUE.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.367
{\an8}KETCHUP IS LOADED
WITH SALT.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.828
{\an8}YOU CANNOT EAT KETCHUP
DURING BATHING SUIT SEASON.

04:46.911 --> 04:50.081
{\an8}YOU ARE JUST
ASKING FOR BLOAT.

{\an8}- I AM DOOMED.

{\an8}- ELKA, HERE'S YOURS.
- OH.

04:59.674 --> 05:04.053
{\an8}WEDDING.
- SPANX.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.513
{\an8}- WHY?
- BECAUSE,

05:05.596 --> 05:06.139
{\an8}YOU HAVE TO WEAR
SPANX TO A WEDDING.

05:06.222 --> 05:08.057
{\an8}THERE'S GONNA BE PICTURES.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.393
{\an8}- OH.

05:10.476 --> 05:13.896
{\an8}- VODKA.
- TONIC.

05:13.980 --> 05:17.316
{\an8}- NO, I NEED VODKA.

05:19.986 --> 05:23.072
{\an8}- I'M READY
FOR MY FIRST STAKEOUT.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.532
{\an8}- VICTORIA, AREN'T YOU

05:24.615 --> 05:26.701
{\an8}A LITTLE OVER DRESSED
FOR A SIMPLE STAKEOUT?

05:26.784 --> 05:29.912
{\an8}- I'M A TV DETECTIVE IN A VERY
HIGH PROFILE HBO DRAMA, JOY.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.290
I NEED TO "POP."
WHICH IS WHY I'M TRYING

05:32.373 --> 05:35.084
TO CHOOSE THE PERFECT
AFFECTATION FOR MY CHARACTER.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.210
- AFFECTATION?

05:36.294 --> 05:37.795
- YEAH, YOU KNOW, A TICK

05:37.879 --> 05:40.381
THAT THE AUDIENCE WILL REMEMBER
AND ASSOCIATE WITH ME.

05:40.465 --> 05:43.092
I WAS THINKING
OF DOING A WINK

05:43.176 --> 05:44.844
AT THE END
OF EVERY LINE OF DIALOGUE.

05:47.221 --> 05:49.390
"THIS IS THE MOST
GRUESOME MURDER I'VE EVER SEEN."

05:55.021 --> 05:56.230
- I DON'T KNOW,
VICTORIA,

05:56.314 --> 05:58.024
'CAUSE WHEN YOU WINK
AFTER EVERY SENTENCE,

05:58.107 --> 06:00.443
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU DON'T REALLY
MEAN WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.570
- I THINK IT'S
A BRILLIANT IDEA.

06:14.540 --> 06:17.585
- BOB.

06:19.921 --> 06:24.050
- SORRY I'M LATE, JOY.
I WAS BUSY WITH MAN BUSINESS.

06:27.011 --> 06:29.180
VICTORIA, AS A DETECTIVE,

06:29.263 --> 06:33.601
I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE
THAT OUR JACKETS ARE SIMILAR.

06:35.686 --> 06:37.355
- THEY'RE IDENTICAL, BOB.

06:37.438 --> 06:40.983
YOU'RE WEARING
A WOMAN'S JACKET.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.985
- I DON'T THINK SO.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.655
NO, I PURCHASED THIS
AT A VERY EXCLUSIVE STORE

06:45.738 --> 06:46.989
IN BEACHWOOD PLACE.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.449
- WHERE THE MEN'S DEPARTMENT

06:48.533 --> 06:50.368
IS RIGHT NEXT
TO THE WOMEN'S?

06:55.164 --> 06:57.333
- PERHAPS.

06:57.416 --> 06:59.127
LET'S GET TO THAT STAKEOUT,
SHALL WE?

06:59.210 --> 07:02.922
ON THE WAY, I NEED TO RETURN
A PAIR OF LEATHER PANTS.

07:08.052 --> 07:10.555
- SO, WHAT ARE
WE STAKING OUT?

07:10.638 --> 07:12.682
- WE'RE LOOKING FOR A MAN
WHO'S CHEATING ON HIS WIFE.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.892
THIS IS THE MISTRESS'
APARTMENT BUILDING.

07:14.976 --> 07:17.770
WE NEED A PICTURE OF HIM
SNEAKING OUT THE BACK STAIRWAY.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.981
- I'M SICK
OF THESE ADULTEROUS PUNKS.

07:20.064 --> 07:22.358
DAMN IT!

07:22.441 --> 07:24.485
- WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU?

07:24.569 --> 07:26.863
- IT'S JUST
HOW A MAN ACTS, JOY,

07:26.946 --> 07:28.865
ESPECIALLY WHEN
HE'S PACKING HEAT.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.867
- OH, MY GOD.
IS THAT A TASER?

07:30.950 --> 07:32.577
GIVE ME THAT.
YOU'RE GONNA HURT YOURSELF.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.036
- I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE TO PRY
THIS FROM MY COLD, DEAD--

07:34.120 --> 07:36.497
FINE, BUT IT'S STILL MINE.

07:36.581 --> 07:37.915
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.209
YOU'VE BEEN ACTING LIKE THIS
ALL DAY.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.546
THIS IS OUR LAST CASE TOGETHER,
AND YOU'RE MAKING IT WEIRD.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.506
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SORRY, JOY.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.383
I WAS JUST TRYING TO
ACT TOUGH

07:47.466 --> 07:50.178
TO BE MORE LIKE SIMON
AND MITCH

07:50.261 --> 07:52.638
IN THE HOPES THAT YOU'D CHANGE
YOUR MIND ABOUT LEAVING.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.183
THE LAST ACT
OF A DESPERATE MAN.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.893
- HEY, THAT GUY
OVER THERE BY THE DUMPSTER,

07:56.976 --> 07:58.895
IS THAT YOUR CHEATER?

07:58.978 --> 08:00.396
- THAT'S NOT HIM,
BUT CHECK OUT THE WAY

08:00.479 --> 08:02.273
HE'S HOLDING THAT CIGARETTE.

08:02.356 --> 08:03.524
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
RUSSIAN?

08:03.608 --> 08:05.610
UKRAINIAN?
- CHECHEN.

08:05.693 --> 08:06.652
LOOK AT HIS SHOES.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.864
CHECHEN'S ALWAYS
HAVE IMPECCABLY SHINED SHOES.

08:09.947 --> 08:11.407
- NICE READ,

08:11.490 --> 08:14.243
AND THOSE TATTOOS SUGGEST TIME
IN A RUSSIAN PRISON.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.163
- AND THAT HAIRCUT SAYS THAT
HE WAS RECENTLY IN AUSTRALIA.

08:17.246 --> 08:19.081
- HOW DID YOU GET THAT?

08:19.165 --> 08:21.751
- OH, I DON'T KNOW. I THOUGHT
WE WERE JUST MAKING STUFF UP.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.590
- HEY, LOOK, HE JUST
TOSSED THE BAG IN THE DUMPSTER.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.258
- AND NOW HE'S TAKING OFF.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.343
SHOULD WE GO CHECK IT OUT?

08:30.426 --> 08:31.969
- GOOD IDEA, DETECTIVE.

08:32.053 --> 08:35.765
AT THAT DUMPSTER,
CHECK OUT TIME IS NOW.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.270
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
THE WINK IS TERRIBLE.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.774
- HM.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.067
- OH, MY GOD.

08:46.150 --> 08:47.985
- WHAT?

08:48.069 --> 08:52.114
- WHO THROWS OUT AN UNOPENED BAG
OF COOL RANCH DORITOS?

08:52.198 --> 08:55.326
- BE SERIOUS.
DID YOU FIND THE BAG?

08:55.409 --> 08:56.494
- YEAH, THERE IT IS, AND--

08:56.577 --> 08:58.246
WHOA.

08:58.329 --> 08:59.622
IT'S FULL OF MONEY.

08:59.705 --> 09:00.790
- HOW MUCH?
- I DON'T KNOW.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.376
IT LOOKS LIKE
ABOUT $20,000 DOLLARS.

09:03.459 --> 09:05.253
THIS IS
A BIG LEAGUE CASE, JOY.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.629
- I'LL SAY.

09:06.712 --> 09:10.591
THAT'S A LOT
OF CASH, MEAT.

09:10.675 --> 09:13.177
MY CHARACTER
CALLS PEOPLE "MEAT."

09:19.016 --> 09:20.768
I'LL BE IN THE CAR.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.526
- SO, YOU THINK MY MOTHER
DROVE AWAY THE MAN

09:28.609 --> 09:30.861
WHO WAS MY ONLY CHANCE
AT HAPPINESS,

09:30.945 --> 09:33.656
AND THE SWEETEST REVENGE
WOULD TO BECOME YOUR PARTNER

09:33.739 --> 09:37.660
AND ABANDON
THAT CONTROLLING SHREW?

09:37.743 --> 09:39.912
- I WOULDN'T USE
THOSE EXACT WORDS.

09:39.996 --> 09:42.790
- I'M QUOTING YOUR TEXT.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.002
- DON'T DO IT FOR ME.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.004
DO IT FOR YOUR LOST LOVE.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.006
- OH, STERLING.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.300
YOU KNOW,
HE ATE LIKE A BIRD.

09:52.383 --> 09:55.845
HE WAS DEATHLY AFRAID
OF GETTING FOOD ON HIS HANDS.

10:03.144 --> 10:05.563
- HE SOUNDS SUPER HOT.

10:05.646 --> 10:07.898
- ELKA, WHAT IS GOING ON?

10:07.982 --> 10:09.817
YOU DECIDED TO GO
A DIFFERENT DIRECTION

10:09.900 --> 10:11.193
WITH YOUR SECRET WORD
PARTNER?

10:11.277 --> 10:12.361
- I NEVER SAID THAT.

10:12.445 --> 10:16.157
- I'M QUOTING YOUR TEXT.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.951
- MONA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH HER?

10:19.035 --> 10:20.995
- I'M ELKA'S PARTNER NOW.

10:21.078 --> 10:23.080
YOU DON'T CONTROL
ME ANYMORE.

10:23.164 --> 10:26.667
ELKA DOES.
- OH?

10:26.751 --> 10:29.545
DOES ELKA MAKE
YOUR POT PIES?

10:29.628 --> 10:33.841
- OH, THEY'RE SO GOOD.

10:33.924 --> 10:38.220
SORRY, ELKA.

10:38.304 --> 10:41.015
- MELANIE,
I THINK YOU GOT A TEXT.

10:41.098 --> 10:44.268
- OH, DID I?
- YEAH.

10:44.352 --> 10:48.064
- "BY READING THIS, I AGREE
TO BECOME ELKA'S PARTNER AGAIN."

10:48.147 --> 10:51.942
- CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU'RE BACK ON THE TEAM.

10:52.026 --> 10:54.904
- NICE TRY ELKA,
BUT YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.239
NOBODY TELLS MELANIE MORETTI
WHAT TO DO.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.408
I'M OUT OF HERE.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.410
- WILL YOU PUT ANOTHER QUARTER
IN THE METER?

11:01.494 --> 11:04.413
- OH, YEAH, SURE.
DAMN IT.

11:08.876 --> 11:10.419
- CLEARLY WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A DROP.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.921
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO COME
TO THAT DUMPSTER

11:12.004 --> 11:13.089
AND COLLECT THE MONEY.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.465
- IS IT DANGEROUS?

11:14.548 --> 11:16.092
- I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
VICTORIA.

11:16.175 --> 11:19.095
I'VE DEVELOPED A CAT-LIKE
AWARENESS OF MY SURROUNDINGS.

11:19.178 --> 11:22.890
- AH!

11:22.973 --> 11:24.600
- MELANIE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:24.683 --> 11:25.810
WE'RE AT A CRIME SCENE.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.395
- I KNOW,
BUT THE HOUSE WAS EMPTY,

11:27.478 --> 11:29.939
AND I NEEDED SOMEBODY
TO VENT TO.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.942
ELKA TRIED TO DITCH ME
AND MAKE MONA HER PARTNER,

11:33.025 --> 11:35.111
WHICH MEANS I WOULDN'T BE
IN THE CONTEST AT ALL.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.821
- APROPOS OF NOTHING,
MELANIE,

11:36.904 --> 11:41.450
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU GOT LAID?

11:41.534 --> 11:42.952
- I'M JUST HURT, OKAY?

11:43.035 --> 11:45.079
YOU DON'T JUST
ABANDON YOUR PARTNER.

11:45.162 --> 11:48.207
- WELL, PARTNERSHIPS
CAN BE COMPLICATED.

11:48.290 --> 11:51.335
IT MAY HURT, BUT IF YOU REALLY
CARE ABOUT YOUR PARTNER,

11:51.419 --> 11:52.962
YOU HAVE TO TAKE
THE HIGH ROAD,

11:53.045 --> 11:55.131
LET THEM DO IMPETUOUS,
MISGUIDED THINGS

11:55.214 --> 11:59.176
AND JUST HOPE
IT DOESN'T WORK OUT FOR HER.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.971
- OH I GUESS SO,
BUT WE'RE FRIENDS.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.973
- WELL, JUST
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT PARTNERS,

12:04.056 --> 12:05.433
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE NOT FRIENDS.

12:05.516 --> 12:09.145
- STILL, YOU CAN'T JUST
THROW A GOOD PARTNERSHIP AWAY.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.981
NOW, HAVING CHEMISTRY WITH
SOMEONE IS A HARD THING TO FIND.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.941
- ALL RIGHT.
I GET THE SUBTEXT HERE.

12:14.024 --> 12:16.193
ELKA AND I ARE FRIENDS,

12:16.277 --> 12:19.989
AND SHE JUST WANTS TO WIN
AND BEAT HER RIVAL

12:20.072 --> 12:22.783
AND NOT BE HUMILIATED
ONCE AGAIN.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.702
THAT'S WHY SHE DUMPED ME.

12:24.785 --> 12:27.455
- PLUS, YOU'RE REALLY,
REALLY BAD AT GAMES.

12:27.538 --> 12:29.498
- SEE, I GET
WHAT YOU'RE DOING THERE TOO.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.001
IT'S REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.044
THANKS, YOU GUYS.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.796
- YOU'RE TOTALLY GONNA
WIN THAT CONTEST.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.509
SHE'S NOT GONNA
WIN THAT CONTEST.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.970
- SHE LACKS THAT CRITICAL SKILL
OF BEING AHEAD OF HER OPPONENT.

12:43.053 --> 12:45.181
IN A WORD, ANTICIPATION.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.057
AAH!

12:47.141 --> 12:50.060
WOULD YOU STOP DOING THAT?
- SORRY.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.645
LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S IMPORTANT,

12:51.729 --> 12:52.688
BUT THERE WAS A BIG GUY

12:52.771 --> 12:54.231
OVER THERE THAT DROPPED
SOMETHING IN THE DUMPSTER

12:54.315 --> 12:55.483
AND THEN TOOK
SOMETHING OUT.

12:55.566 --> 12:56.692
- OH, NO,
WE MISSED THE DROP.

12:56.775 --> 12:57.943
- ANYWAY, WISH ME LUCK.

13:04.408 --> 13:05.534
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
UNFORTUNATELY

13:05.618 --> 13:07.495
IT LOOKS LIKE ELKA'S GONNA
HAVE TO FORFEIT

13:07.578 --> 13:09.788
BECAUSE SHE
DOES NOT HAVE A PARTNER.

13:09.872 --> 13:12.750
- YES, SHE DOES.

13:17.004 --> 13:18.422
SURPRISED, HUH?

13:18.506 --> 13:22.301
- COMPLETELY.
- WAIT A MINUTE.

13:22.384 --> 13:23.511
WHY IS THERE
A GLASS OF WINE

13:23.594 --> 13:26.347
AND MY READING GLASSES
ON THE TABLE?

13:26.430 --> 13:27.890
HOW DID YOU KNOW
I'D FORGIVE YOU?

13:27.973 --> 13:29.558
HOW DID
YOU KNOW I'D BE BACK?

13:29.642 --> 13:33.479
- THE SECRET WORD
IS "PREDICTABLE."

13:37.983 --> 13:38.901
- I FOUND THE PACKAGE.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.319
- GREAT.

13:40.402 --> 13:42.238
WAIT, SOMEBODY'S COMING.

13:42.321 --> 13:45.074
GET OUT OF SIGHT.

13:45.157 --> 13:48.160
YOU STAY DOWN UNTIL I TELL YOU
IT'S SAFE TO COME OUT.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.579
AH!

13:50.663 --> 13:51.956
- I NEED TO GET IN THERE.

13:52.039 --> 13:54.583
- I'M AFRAID
I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT.

13:54.667 --> 13:58.629
- OKAY, WE CAN DO THIS
THE EASY WAY OR THE HARD WAY.

13:58.712 --> 14:01.924
- THERE'S AN EASY WAY?

14:02.007 --> 14:05.970
- THE POLICE WILL BE HERE SOON,
BECAUSE THERE'S THIS G-G-G-GUY

14:06.053 --> 14:07.304
I'M SORRY, OFFICER,

14:07.388 --> 14:10.808
WHEN I GET SCARED
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I STUTTER.

14:10.891 --> 14:14.979
STUTTERING, OH,
NOW THERE'S A THOUGHT.

14:15.062 --> 14:18.440
WHAT?
- [grunting]

14:18.524 --> 14:20.943
- DO IT, JOY.
- BUT YOU'LL GET HURT.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.153
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS HAPPENING NOW?

14:24.738 --> 14:28.325
[taser zaps]
[both groaning]

14:34.331 --> 14:36.834
- OKAY, LET'S HEAR
FROM OUR CONTESTANTS.

14:36.917 --> 14:39.128
WHY DON'T YOU TELL US YOUR NAME
AND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOURSELF?

14:39.211 --> 14:40.963
- YOU KNOW WHO I AM.

14:41.046 --> 14:44.633
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

14:44.717 --> 14:46.135
- I'VE BEEN WATCHING
CLASSIC GAME SHOWS.

14:46.218 --> 14:48.429
I'M CHANNELING
ALLEN LUDDEN.

14:48.512 --> 14:51.265
- I KNEW ALLEN LUDDEN.

14:51.348 --> 14:54.977
ALLEN LUDDEN WAS A FRIEND
OF MINE,

14:55.060 --> 14:59.106
AND YOU, SIR,
ARE NO ALLEN LUDDEN.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.154
- I'LL INTRODUCE MYSELF.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.156
I'M MONA BRATFORD.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.533
I GRADUATED
FROM SARAH LAWRENCE.

15:09.617 --> 15:14.121
I'M NOT MARRIED,
BUT THERE WAS A MAN ONCE

15:14.204 --> 15:16.707
- CAN WE PLEASE
START THE GAME?

15:16.790 --> 15:19.710
- OKAY, I'LL GIVE
YOU EACH A SECRET WORD.

15:22.630 --> 15:25.424
THE SECRET WORD IS--

15:29.094 --> 15:30.095
- WE GOT THIS ONE.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.305
- OKAY.
- [chuckles]

15:32.973 --> 15:34.808
SALT--

15:34.892 --> 15:36.018
- PEPPER.

15:38.062 --> 15:41.357
- NOW YOU'RE GONNA PLAY
THE GAME CORRECTLY?

15:41.440 --> 15:43.192
- OVER TO YOU AGNES.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.027
- MUSTARD--
- KETCHUP.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.195
- THAT IS CORRECT.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.489
- STERLING LOVED KETCHUP.

15:48.572 --> 15:50.282
HE ATE THAT
LIKE A BIRD TOO.

15:53.619 --> 15:54.870
- ARE YOU OKAY?

15:54.953 --> 15:56.538
SHOULD I TAKE YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL?

15:56.622 --> 15:58.874
- I'M FINE.
IT WAS JUST A TASER.

15:58.957 --> 16:01.335
HOW'S MY HAIR?

16:01.418 --> 16:03.629
- IT'S A LITTLE FLUFFY.

16:03.712 --> 16:07.174
- LIKE A LION'S?

16:07.257 --> 16:08.842
- DEFINITELY.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.552
YOU WERE VERY BRAVE.

16:10.636 --> 16:11.679
- HI.

16:11.762 --> 16:13.389
DETECTIVE VALENZUELA.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.057
GREAT WORK.
- GLAD TO HELP.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.725
- ANY TIME.
- DO YOU HAVE A CARD?

16:16.809 --> 16:18.227
SOMETIMES WHEN
WE'RE STRETCHED THIN,

16:18.310 --> 16:19.728
WE OUTSOURCE WORK
TO LOCAL P.I.'S.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.773
- YEAH.
HERE, HOLD ON A SECOND.

16:22.856 --> 16:23.982
THERE YOU GO.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.401
- WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.152
- YOU TWO MAKE A GOOD TEAM.

16:27.236 --> 16:29.279
- OH, WELL ACTUALLY,
IT WILL JUST BE ME.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.739
SHE'S LEAVING.

16:30.823 --> 16:31.907
- TOO BAD.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.617
- WAIT, STOP.

16:33.701 --> 16:36.245
YOU SEE, I WAS GOING TO
LEAVE, BUT NOW

16:36.328 --> 16:38.872
I'M REALLY RETHINKING IT.
- OKAY.

16:38.956 --> 16:43.085
- BUT IT'S JUST
THAT HE PROPOSED TO ME,

16:43.168 --> 16:47.965
AND I SAID NO, AND THAT MADE
THINGS A BIT AWKWARD.

16:48.048 --> 16:49.466
- SURE.

16:49.550 --> 16:54.096
- BUT YOU'RE RIGHT,
WE DO MAKE A GOOD TEAM.

16:54.179 --> 16:57.558
I'M GONNA STAY.
- GOOD LUCK.

16:57.641 --> 16:59.393
- ONE MORE THING.

16:59.476 --> 17:01.603
I DIDN'T
REALIZE SHE WAS STAYING,

17:01.687 --> 17:04.106
SO IF YOU COULD JUST DISREGARD
THE "CALL ME ANYTIME"

17:04.189 --> 17:07.943
ON THE CARD.

17:08.026 --> 17:09.278
- IS IT SAFE FOR CELEBRITIES
YET?

17:09.361 --> 17:11.821
- HEY, YOU'RE VICTORIA CHASE.

17:11.905 --> 17:14.616
BIG FAN.
CLICK, CLICK.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.617
- INTERESTING.
WELL, THANK YOU, DETECTIVE.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.121
CLICK, CLICK.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.832
- YOU KNOW, I'M PLAYING
A DETECTIVE IN A NEW TV SHOW.

17:21.915 --> 17:25.127
MIND IF I--CLICK, CLICK--
PICK YOUR BRAIN?

17:25.210 --> 17:27.628
- I'M OFF DUTY.
SURE, LET'S GET SOME COFFEE.

17:27.713 --> 17:31.300
AHEM. SORRY, I'VE GOT A LITTLE,
AHEM, THING HERE.

17:31.383 --> 17:34.678
- YOU, AHEM, ARE A GOLD MINE.
CLICK, CLICK.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.644
- I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING, JOY.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.605
AND I PROMISE, FROM NOW ON,
I'LL TRY NOT TO SAY THE THINGS

17:44.688 --> 17:46.648
TO MAKE IT WEIRD
AND AWKWARD.

17:46.732 --> 17:47.816
- THANKS, BOB.
- YEAH, WELL,

17:47.900 --> 17:50.194
WITH ALL THE ELECTRICITY
GOING THROUGH MY BODY RIGHT NOW,

17:50.277 --> 17:52.029
IF WE WERE TO HAVE SEX, YOU'D
LIGHT UP LIKE A PINBALL MACHINE.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.451
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA CHANGE,
ARE YOU?

17:57.534 --> 17:59.036
- NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.413
- NEXT SECRET WORD.

18:03.415 --> 18:06.376
THE SECRET WORD IS--

18:06.460 --> 18:07.669
- OH, THIS IS
GONNA BE EASY

18:07.753 --> 18:10.339
BECAUSE I USED
TO CALL MY DAUGHTER "PEANUT."

18:10.422 --> 18:12.800
DAUGHTER--

18:12.883 --> 18:14.635
- THE SECRET WORD
IS "PEANUT," ISN'T IT?

18:14.718 --> 18:17.805
- YES, YOU GOT IT.

18:17.888 --> 18:20.891
'CAUSE I SAID IT.

18:20.974 --> 18:22.518
HALF A POINT?

18:22.601 --> 18:27.189
- NO.
NEXT SECRET WORD.

18:27.272 --> 18:30.067
THE SECRET WORD IS--

18:30.150 --> 18:33.987
- SOMETHING I'LL NEVER HAVE
BECAUSE YOU RUINED MY LIFE

18:34.071 --> 18:36.198
WHEN YOU SENT
STERLING AWAY,

18:36.281 --> 18:39.535
BUT I REFUSE TO BECOME OLD
AND MISERABLE LIKE YOU.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.870
I'M GONNA GO FIND HIM.

18:48.126 --> 18:52.005
- WELL, BEST OF LUCK
TO MONA.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.591
SO, FOR THE WIN, THE PLAY
GOES TO YOU, MELANIE.

18:54.675 --> 18:55.717
- I'M SO NERVOUS.

18:55.801 --> 18:59.137
- JUST GIVE THE MOST
OBVIOUS CLUE.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.351
- FLAT--
- JOY.

19:04.434 --> 19:05.727
- THAT'S CORRECT.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.694
- I'M JUST SITTING HERE.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.617
- AND THE NEWS COVERAGE
HAS BEEN GREAT FOR THE AGENCY.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.452
WE'VE ALREADY GOTTEN
NEW CLIENTS.

19:22.536 --> 19:24.079
- WE?

19:24.163 --> 19:25.372
- YOU'RE STAYING WITH BOB?

19:25.455 --> 19:28.375
- YES, WE MAKE A GOOD TEAM.

19:28.458 --> 19:31.628
WE HAVE GREAT CHEMISTRY,
AND I WANT HIM IN MY LIFE.

19:33.213 --> 19:35.757
AND, VICTORIA,
NOW THAT WE HAVE MORE CASES,

19:35.841 --> 19:37.217
YOU'RE WELCOME TO RIDE ALONG

19:37.301 --> 19:39.094
AND DO MORE RESEARCH
FOR YOUR HBO SHOW.

19:39.177 --> 19:41.054
- OH, NO THANKS.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.390
AFTER SPENDING AN EVENING
WITH DETECTIVE VALENZUELA,

19:43.473 --> 19:46.393
I REALIZED THAT I DON'T NEED
WINKS, OR CLICKS,

19:46.476 --> 19:50.772
OR A LESBIAN
DETECTIVE LOVER.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.108
THAT WAS HER SUGGESTION.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.239
AND HAVING WATCHED
YOU AND BOB,

19:59.323 --> 20:02.784
I DECIDED THAT JUST WORKING ON
GOOD CHEMISTRY WITH MY CO-STAR

20:02.868 --> 20:04.328
IS THE WAY TO GO.

20:04.411 --> 20:06.830
- OKAY, PARTNER,
SHALL WE TOAST TO OUR VICTORY?

20:06.914 --> 20:08.123
LET ME FILL UP YOUR GLASS?

20:08.206 --> 20:10.792
- NO, NOT NECESSARY.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.461
[bell ringing]

20:18.884 --> 20:20.344
- WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU,

20:20.427 --> 20:24.139
SECRET WORD MASTER?

20:24.222 --> 20:27.601
- WE MAY HAVE HAD
A SIDE BET.
