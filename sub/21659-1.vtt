WEBVTT

00:10.208 --> 00:11.916
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:11.917 --> 00:16.207
live from Laugh Factory
Long Beach, Erik Griffin!

00:22.667 --> 00:23.667
Hey!

00:27.834 --> 00:30.499
What's up, Strong Beach?

00:32.417 --> 00:36.374
Um...

00:36.375 --> 00:39.833
I'm feeling special
for this special, right?

00:39.834 --> 00:41.207
Uh...

00:41.208 --> 00:43.158
I'm gonna be honest with you,
the ugly truth is,

00:43.159 --> 00:46.749
I wanted to be in shape for this.

00:46.750 --> 00:48.207
I had big plans, too.

00:48.208 --> 00:49.999
I was like,
I'm gonna get in shape.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.041
Um... hurt my ankle, um...

00:54.917 --> 00:57.499
Hurt the ankle.

00:57.500 --> 00:58.558
Wish I had a good story,

00:58.559 --> 01:00.249
like, I was out
on the basketball court

01:00.250 --> 01:02.632
and these young kids was like,
you can't guard us, old man.

01:02.633 --> 01:06.508
I was like, please,
crossover, crossover!

01:07.166 --> 01:08.474
That's not what happened, um...

01:08.475 --> 01:13.207
I was actually on my way
to a basketball game,

01:13.208 --> 01:18.165
opened up the car door
and stepped wrong, you know?

01:18.166 --> 01:22.457
That's some old fat shit
right there.

01:22.458 --> 01:24.124
And then when
you sprain your ankle,

01:24.125 --> 01:26.416
you do this weird thing
where you go like this.

01:26.417 --> 01:28.582
Ahh! Ohh!

01:28.583 --> 01:30.541
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

01:30.542 --> 01:34.249
And then when I was doing that,
I sprained the other ankle.

01:34.250 --> 01:38.207
So, I needed to go
to the doctor, okay?

01:38.208 --> 01:41.082
Um, went to
the foot doctor, right?

01:41.083 --> 01:42.109
And this bitch, right?

01:42.110 --> 01:45.708
She looks...

01:45.709 --> 01:50.249
She looks at me and goes,
you need to lose some weight.

01:50.250 --> 01:52.124
And I was like, looking up at her,

01:52.125 --> 01:57.916
like, um... cool.

01:57.917 --> 02:03.082
But can we discuss my ankle?

02:03.083 --> 02:06.457
This one is swollen and...

02:06.458 --> 02:10.999
You probably should
start exercising.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.874
I want to do that.

02:13.875 --> 02:19.499
But my ankle...

02:19.500 --> 02:22.833
Bitch, man.

02:22.834 --> 02:24.582
I'm telling you,

02:24.583 --> 02:28.290
you would only say that to a
man, you know what I mean?

02:28.291 --> 02:29.999
You could only...
Can you imagine a woman?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.716
You imagine...
Ladies, you imagine a doctor

02:31.717 --> 02:36.457
looking at you and going,
you're fat and you eat too much.

02:36.458 --> 02:38.457
You would kill yourself.

02:38.458 --> 02:41.290
It's much harder to be a fat guy
than it is to be a fat girl,

02:41.291 --> 02:42.624
I'll tell you that right now.

02:42.625 --> 02:44.125
But of course,
women are always like,

02:44.126 --> 02:46.290
you don't know the pressures
of being a woman.

02:46.291 --> 02:50.582
Hey, there's no fat guy
empowerment song

02:50.583 --> 02:52.332
on the fucking radio.

02:52.333 --> 02:57.374
There's no "All About that Bass"
for dudes.

02:57.375 --> 03:00.749
But every single year,
there's some new song.

03:00.750 --> 03:01.958
Big bitches unite! Woo!

03:01.959 --> 03:04.250
Big bitches unite!

03:07.542 --> 03:11.374
You know what I mean?
Every single year, you know?

03:11.375 --> 03:13.249
♪ Big bitches unite ♪

03:13.250 --> 03:15.040
♪ I'm a big bitch
and you know it ♪

03:15.041 --> 03:18.125
It's like...

03:19.875 --> 03:22.207
And we coddle... We like to
coddle fat people, you know.

03:22.208 --> 03:26.332
You should feel good about you!

03:26.333 --> 03:31.040
No. What the fuck
are you talking about?

03:31.041 --> 03:32.999
I tell the doctor, I...

03:33.000 --> 03:35.833
She says to me, she's like, I say,
I was gonna work out, you know.

03:35.834 --> 03:37.374
She was like, well, listen.

03:37.375 --> 03:41.417
The real problem is fork-to-mouth.

03:47.500 --> 03:50.040
You know what I hate
when you tell your friends?

03:50.041 --> 03:51.332
I told all my friends,

03:51.333 --> 03:52.774
I'm gonna lose some weight, watch.

03:52.775 --> 03:57.082
They... Everybody becomes
the food police.

03:57.083 --> 03:58.332
You know, when you're...

03:58.333 --> 04:01.708
Everybody becomes
the food sheriff?

04:01.709 --> 04:02.933
Every time you reach for food.

04:02.934 --> 04:07.332
I thought you was, uh...

04:07.333 --> 04:11.290
I thought you was trying
to lose some weight.

04:11.291 --> 04:13.916
Everybody's a nutritionist
all of a sudden, too.

04:13.917 --> 04:16.116
Ooh, that's not good for you,
that's not good for you.

04:16.117 --> 04:18.416
I thought you was...

04:18.416 --> 04:20.416
I thought you was trying
to lose some weight.

04:20.416 --> 04:23.874
I'm in church trying
to get communion.

04:23.875 --> 04:25.041
Ooh, that's a lot of Jesus.

04:27.875 --> 04:31.249
How much Jesus you gonna have?

04:31.250 --> 04:33.040
Why you take peanut butter
up there?

04:33.041 --> 04:35.040
What you trying...

04:35.041 --> 04:39.124
Mind your fucking business.

04:39.125 --> 04:44.250
What I'm doing with me and my
Lord is none of your business.

04:45.750 --> 04:46.824
And then, what...

04:46.825 --> 04:48.275
You know what really
pisses me off?

04:48.276 --> 04:49.482
When they're hungry, you know?

04:49.483 --> 04:51.874
When your friend...
When they're hungry, they...

04:51.875 --> 04:53.124
"Hey, let's go to Fat Burger!"

04:53.125 --> 04:58.040
What? I'm an addict.

04:58.041 --> 05:02.207
I can't go to...

05:02.208 --> 05:03.690
Fat Burger's like going
to the club,

05:03.691 --> 05:08.817
I'm in there like, oh, shit!

05:14.500 --> 05:16.040
I'm like, they're playing my jam.

05:16.041 --> 05:17.117
Is that bacon sizzling?

05:22.417 --> 05:24.916
So of course,
I fall off the wagon,

05:24.917 --> 05:26.457
I get the double king burger

05:26.458 --> 05:29.124
with the Oreo cookie shake
and the chili cheese fries.

05:29.125 --> 05:30.290
My friend turns to me.

05:30.291 --> 05:32.499
I thought you was, uh...

05:32.500 --> 05:35.457
I thought you were trying
to lose some weight.

05:35.458 --> 05:42.165
Hey, bitch. We're in Fat Burger.

05:42.166 --> 05:43.499
It's in the name.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.999
Fat Burger...
They're not trying to hide.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.874
This isn't a wellness center
up in here right now.

05:49.875 --> 05:52.207
That's when they want
to look at the menu

05:52.208 --> 05:54.290
and tell you what
you should've ordered.

05:54.291 --> 05:59.207
Well, they have a veggie burger
on a gluten-free bun.

05:59.208 --> 06:01.833
Shit.

06:01.834 --> 06:05.667
That's like going to
a whorehouse and cuddling.

06:08.333 --> 06:11.500
Um, I'm here to fuck, so...

06:13.834 --> 06:18.166
Bring out these Asian girls
with the fat burgers, please.

06:22.333 --> 06:24.874
So my doctor, though,
I'm sitting there

06:24.875 --> 06:28.541
and she tells me,
since you can't "work out,"

06:28.542 --> 06:31.999
I'm gonna put you on
a calorie diet, she said.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.374
2,000 calories a day.

06:34.375 --> 06:38.958
That sounds like a lot to me.

06:38.959 --> 06:44.333
But apparently, calories are on
some kind of peso exchange rate.

06:47.208 --> 06:52.624
You have no idea how much calories are
until you start counting the shit.

06:52.625 --> 06:57.082
Let me tell you something,
2,000 is like, a muffin,

06:57.083 --> 06:59.791
two basil leaves,

06:59.792 --> 07:02.749
and some Vitamin Water,
about that much right there.

07:02.750 --> 07:05.624
So I have no idea,
so I go to the restaurant,

07:05.625 --> 07:07.658
you know, and I'm like,
okay gotta count calories.

07:07.659 --> 07:09.982
But I still don't know, I'm
like, let me get an appetizer.

07:09.983 --> 07:12.416
Uh, let me get
the onion ring loaf.

07:12.417 --> 07:15.207
Just bring me the onion ring
loaf appeti...

07:15.208 --> 07:16.582
Okay, that's 2,000, all right.

07:16.583 --> 07:21.416
Um, this is probably 250,
275 calories.

07:21.417 --> 07:25.249
This shit was 3,000...

07:25.250 --> 07:29.082
3,000 calories for the...

07:29.083 --> 07:32.416
That fucks off my whole day

07:32.417 --> 07:37.124
and half of tomorrow.

07:37.125 --> 07:42.457
And I'm still waiting on
baby back ribs.

07:42.458 --> 07:45.624
Had the key lime pie for dessert,

07:45.625 --> 07:47.958
had a potato, had a Coke.

07:47.959 --> 07:50.958
Had ranch with the...
With the onion rings, ranch.

07:50.959 --> 07:53.249
Do you know how bad for you
ranch dressing is?

07:53.250 --> 07:54.916
Let me tell you something.

07:54.917 --> 07:58.916
This much ranch right here,
that's like 500-700 calories.

07:58.917 --> 08:02.624
That's the devil's
love juice right there.

08:02.625 --> 08:05.541
The devil's
in every kitchen going...

08:05.542 --> 08:06.542
Aah.

08:08.417 --> 08:10.999
Okay, good, I'm saving lives
in here right now.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.124
The next time you order ranch,
you gonna see this.

08:13.125 --> 08:16.583
Ahh!

08:20.792 --> 08:23.207
See, the main problem too
is how funny fat is.

08:23.208 --> 08:24.958
See how we're laughing?

08:24.959 --> 08:27.999
Fat is funny as shit.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.833
I'm an actor, okay?
When you... When you're in a...

08:30.834 --> 08:33.289
You see the script and it says,
you're a thief.

08:33.291 --> 08:36.457
Guess what? You're not a thief.

08:36.457 --> 08:38.164
It says you're crazy.
I'm not crazy.

08:38.166 --> 08:44.164
When it says you're fat.

08:44.166 --> 08:47.833
You're probably fat.

08:47.834 --> 08:53.124
When another actor says to your
character, you fat fuck!

08:53.125 --> 08:54.290
I have a moment of, like...

08:58.375 --> 09:02.207
Is that me? Fat is just funny.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.508
Fat is the only disease that
we just, like, we don't care,

09:04.509 --> 09:06.499
we just laugh at it,
we make jokes about it.

09:06.500 --> 09:07.874
It's the only disease.

09:07.875 --> 09:09.999
Obesity kills people
every single day, right?

09:10.000 --> 09:13.040
But nobody else would be like,
oh, there go Cancer Charlie!

09:13.041 --> 09:15.165
Ahh!

09:15.166 --> 09:16.708
What up, Cancer Charlie!

09:16.709 --> 09:18.307
Oh, there go Cancer Tina.
No-Titty Tina!

09:18.308 --> 09:19.874
What up, girl?

09:19.875 --> 09:23.374
Oh, look, you're mortified.
See what I'm saying?

09:23.375 --> 09:24.874
That's my whole fucking point.

09:24.875 --> 09:26.709
But if it's somebody fat,
you're just like...

09:26.710 --> 09:30.834
Ha ha ha ha ha! Hey, hey, hey!

09:32.000 --> 09:36.165
Like, it doesn't matter
how tragic a story is.

09:36.166 --> 09:37.666
If you find out the person's fat,

09:37.667 --> 09:41.582
you're not as sympathetic
to their plight.

09:41.583 --> 09:43.499
They're about to do a movie
about those, like...

09:43.500 --> 09:46.207
Remember those miners in Chile
that got trapped?

09:46.208 --> 09:48.749
Like, what if they were fat?

09:48.750 --> 09:54.249
You can't... Fat guys in a hole,
that shit is funny.

09:54.250 --> 09:57.666
All I'm saying is it makes
a bad situation worse.

09:57.667 --> 10:02.040
Like, what if, like,
Helen Keller was fat?

10:03.208 --> 10:06.582
I know.

10:06.583 --> 10:10.582
I know, she's already
deaf and blind!

10:10.583 --> 10:11.650
Which begs the question,

10:11.651 --> 10:15.082
why wasn't she fat?

10:15.083 --> 10:17.624
Like, what was her workout,
you know what I mean?

10:17.625 --> 10:19.916
She wasn't in an aerobic class,

10:19.917 --> 10:22.750
'cause the teacher
would be like, Helen!

10:25.041 --> 10:26.542
Helen!

10:27.709 --> 10:29.457
Helen!

10:29.458 --> 10:30.958
Can this bitch hear me?

10:30.959 --> 10:33.083
Helen!

10:33.792 --> 10:35.072
She's just standing in the back.

10:37.000 --> 10:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:44.917 --> 10:47.082
She was probably fat.
This is a bad example.

10:47.083 --> 10:48.457
This is a bad example.

10:48.458 --> 10:51.499
Okay, uh...

10:51.500 --> 10:53.191
Bad situation worse,
okay, like, all right.

10:53.192 --> 10:56.791
What if, like, Anne Frank was fat?

10:56.792 --> 10:58.833
Aww!

10:58.834 --> 11:02.290
I know, the guards would
have heard her breathing.

11:09.076 --> 11:10.666
She can't even walk in the attic.

11:20.959 --> 11:24.624
Like, imagine how mad
the family would be.

11:24.625 --> 11:27.666
Anne!

11:27.667 --> 11:33.040
Would you shut the fuck... up?

11:33.041 --> 11:36.582
What? Are you trying
to get caught?

11:36.583 --> 11:40.040
Who brought
this big bitch up here?

11:40.041 --> 11:41.958
Was it you?

11:41.959 --> 11:46.457
The diary'd be full of recipes,
you know what I mean?

11:46.458 --> 11:48.916
Day four.

11:48.917 --> 11:51.416
Apple strudel.

11:51.417 --> 11:52.666
She just eating chips.

11:54.375 --> 11:57.541
Anne!

11:57.542 --> 11:58.749
How does this bitch get chips?

11:58.750 --> 12:01.165
How the fuck...

12:01.166 --> 12:02.874
We up here starving.

12:02.875 --> 12:05.833
It just...
It makes a bad situation worse.

12:05.834 --> 12:08.207
Maybe you couldn't accomplish
the things you accomplish.

12:08.208 --> 12:10.140
You know, maybe if it's
brain things, you know,

12:10.141 --> 12:11.974
Einstein probably still would
have been smart,

12:11.975 --> 12:13.833
but would we know
who Kobe Bryant is?

12:13.834 --> 12:15.791
We wouldn't know who Kobe is.

12:15.792 --> 12:17.574
It makes your achievements
harder to achieve.

12:17.575 --> 12:18.708
That's all I'm saying.

12:18.709 --> 12:22.833
Like, you couldn't have a...
A fat Jesus.

12:22.834 --> 12:26.499
I mean, imagine the logistics.

12:26.500 --> 12:29.875
Trying to get fat Jesus
on the cross.

12:32.417 --> 12:36.874
I mean, you'd have to have
a rope and pulley system.

12:36.875 --> 12:42.082
They're trying to nail him,
he's sliding down, you know.

12:42.083 --> 12:43.582
All the miracles
would be different.

12:43.583 --> 12:45.582
He's walking on water waist deep.

12:45.583 --> 12:46.959
I'm your Lord.

12:49.917 --> 12:54.749
The last supper'd
be a buffet, you know.

12:54.750 --> 12:56.332
Judas would be at the buffet.

12:56.333 --> 12:58.374
Really, Jesus?

12:58.375 --> 13:00.875
How much ranch
you gonna put on that lamb?

13:01.917 --> 13:05.249
You couldn't have a fat Moses
either, you know?

13:05.250 --> 13:09.708
I mean, Moses went on
a long walk in the desert.

13:09.709 --> 13:12.708
He had all the Jews behind him.

13:12.709 --> 13:16.457
Fat Moses would have been like,
come on, Jews.

13:16.458 --> 13:19.999
Come on, Jews.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.041
Ooh...

13:24.625 --> 13:27.916
Oh, shit, this is...

13:27.917 --> 13:32.542
Goddamn, it's hot
as a motherfucker out here.

13:33.458 --> 13:35.749
Hold on, Jews!

13:35.750 --> 13:41.290
Oh, shit! Woo!

13:41.291 --> 13:45.624
Moses need to stop
for a second, Jews.

13:45.625 --> 13:51.749
Jews, Jews, oh...

13:51.750 --> 13:53.510
Anybody else feet fucked up
in these sandals?

13:57.667 --> 14:01.708
Okay, new plan, Jews, new plan.

14:01.709 --> 14:04.959
The promised land
is gonna be right here.

14:08.667 --> 14:10.833
Look at all this land.

14:10.834 --> 14:13.583
Get comfortable, motherfucker,
get comfortable.

14:18.834 --> 14:23.958
Oh, God. Such a fat fuck.

14:23.959 --> 14:28.124
The problem is
it's so easy to put on weight

14:28.125 --> 14:31.541
and so hard to take it off, right?

14:31.542 --> 14:35.000
That's why when I die, I'm going
right to human resources.

14:38.041 --> 14:43.499
I'm gonna fill out
one of those comment cards.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.040
I'm gonna change some shit.

14:45.041 --> 14:51.708
Food that tastes good
should be good for you.

14:51.709 --> 14:55.541
If I eat one pound of food,
how much weight should I gain?

14:55.542 --> 14:59.541
One pound.

14:59.542 --> 15:03.083
One pound of Oreos...

15:08.000 --> 15:11.999
What the fuck happens
to the Oreos?

15:12.000 --> 15:16.833
Are we cloning shit inside?

15:16.834 --> 15:18.382
We need to figure out
this technology,

15:18.383 --> 15:21.666
we could feed the fucking world.

15:21.667 --> 15:23.067
And what is all this
in the toilet?

15:23.068 --> 15:25.483
I'm still gaining weight.

15:31.125 --> 15:34.082
The human body
is a wondrous machine,

15:34.083 --> 15:38.416
but there's some stuff
about it I would change.

15:38.417 --> 15:40.416
Like, I don't get balding.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.708
Balding doesn't make
any fucking sense to me.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.709
Right, sir, I see you over there.

15:48.250 --> 15:51.082
Like, if hair is gonna
arbitrarily leave your body,

15:51.083 --> 15:54.457
it should be the ass first, right?

15:54.458 --> 15:56.082
You'd be showing off.

15:56.083 --> 15:59.708
Baby, you better come in here
and look at this shit here.

15:59.709 --> 16:03.040
I'm like a ten-year-old boy
back there, look at that as.

16:03.041 --> 16:06.250
And look at the balls,
look at the balls!

16:09.792 --> 16:12.040
The human body is weird.

16:12.041 --> 16:14.791
How about this,
let's have male and female

16:14.792 --> 16:18.040
sexual peaks at the same time,
you know?

16:18.041 --> 16:23.499
18 to, like, 27,
men are just fuck machines.

16:23.500 --> 16:26.207
We wake up in the morning,
I gotta make some ranch.

16:26.208 --> 16:29.833
This is...

16:29.834 --> 16:31.916
Isn't it crazy that
that's our sexual peak?

16:31.917 --> 16:36.040
Women, your sexual peak
is, like, 89.

16:36.041 --> 16:40.041
Women are, like, you better come
tear this pussy up.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.917
Don't make me chase you.

16:51.667 --> 16:57.040
It makes me feel like, are men
and women even compatible?

16:57.041 --> 16:59.207
You know, it doesn't
even make sense to me, like,

16:59.208 --> 17:01.999
especially sexually,
like, men and women,

17:02.000 --> 17:03.374
we don't even like sex the same.

17:03.375 --> 17:06.915
I think women enjoy sex
far more than we do.

17:06.916 --> 17:12.790
Half the enjoyment for men
is getting to yes.

17:12.791 --> 17:14.325
We love that.
Hey, you wanna fuck me?

17:14.326 --> 17:15.833
No? Okay.

17:15.834 --> 17:17.790
You wanna fuck with me?
Hey, you wanna have sex?

17:17.791 --> 17:18.999
No? You wanna have sex?

17:19.000 --> 17:21.749
Fuck you, bitch.
You wanna have sex?

17:21.750 --> 17:25.125
You wanna have sex? Yes? Ahh!

17:27.375 --> 17:29.474
See, we wanna... we wanna be
with a thousand women.

17:29.475 --> 17:33.582
Every woman wants to be with
their man a thousand times.

17:33.583 --> 17:36.499
And you just enjoy it better,
you love it.

17:36.500 --> 17:42.375
Like, the female orgasm
is probably the most demonic...

17:48.041 --> 17:49.708
You ever see
one of those scary movies

17:49.709 --> 17:51.867
when somebody gets a demon
in them and they're like...

17:53.542 --> 17:54.708
Eat my pussy!

17:54.709 --> 17:57.124
You know what I mean?

17:57.125 --> 17:58.833
It takes over their whole body,

17:58.834 --> 18:03.708
like, the female orgasm starts
in the leg and they just...

18:03.709 --> 18:05.082
Oh, my God!

18:05.083 --> 18:08.541
And like, their face looks like
somebody hit 'em with a brick.

18:11.208 --> 18:12.582
Then they get super emotional.

18:12.583 --> 18:15.749
I fucking love you.
I fucking love you!

18:15.750 --> 18:17.375
I fucking love you!

18:18.917 --> 18:20.416
You make a woman do that,

18:20.417 --> 18:22.377
she's like, well,
we're getting married, just FYI.

18:25.166 --> 18:27.374
Our... our orgasm isn't
like that, right, fellas?

18:27.375 --> 18:28.816
We're just trying
to get rid of it.

18:28.817 --> 18:32.566
Get the fuck out of here,
you get out of here!

18:33.583 --> 18:37.375
Don't you come back in here,
you hear me?

18:40.709 --> 18:42.999
Not women, man.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.749
You know, some women fake it.

18:44.750 --> 18:47.240
You know when they're not faking it?
I'll tell you right now.

18:47.241 --> 18:48.666
They flip you over and get on top.

18:48.667 --> 18:51.165
That's what women
love that the best, right?

18:51.166 --> 18:53.457
They get on top, they're crazy.

18:53.458 --> 18:55.250
I fucking love you!

18:56.709 --> 18:58.874
I fucking love you!

18:58.875 --> 19:00.290
That doesn't feel good.

19:00.291 --> 19:03.457
We be down there,
like, oh, shit, okay.

19:03.458 --> 19:07.791
You just broke my tailbone,
we on a mattress.

19:07.792 --> 19:10.582
Ooh!

19:10.583 --> 19:12.258
That's when they get
the ponytail in, too.

19:12.259 --> 19:15.383
Ahh! I love you!

19:16.291 --> 19:18.749
And then you make it
last forever, too.

19:18.750 --> 19:20.624
That's what I would change.

19:20.625 --> 19:24.457
If you're gonna give women
multiple orgasms,

19:24.458 --> 19:29.332
let ours last longer
than a moment, right, fellas?

19:29.333 --> 19:31.833
Right now, we're just...

19:31.834 --> 19:32.874
Okay, wait.

19:35.834 --> 19:36.834
If you're 18...

19:44.166 --> 19:45.575
Not women, man.
Women are in there.

19:45.576 --> 19:47.624
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

19:47.625 --> 19:49.332
Oh, yeah!

19:49.333 --> 19:50.791
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

19:50.792 --> 19:51.833
Oh, yeah!

19:51.834 --> 19:54.749
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

19:54.750 --> 19:55.767
Oh, yeah!

19:55.768 --> 19:58.749
You can go to the bathroom,
come back.

19:58.750 --> 20:00.499
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

20:00.500 --> 20:01.500
Oh, yeah!

20:01.501 --> 20:04.249
You in the kitchen
making her a sandwich.

20:04.250 --> 20:06.999
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

20:07.000 --> 20:08.067
Hey, do you want tomato?

20:08.068 --> 20:10.165
Yes!

20:10.166 --> 20:13.582
Can you put tomato
in the sandwich?

20:15.709 --> 20:20.416
Bitch, I'm in the kitchen!
I'm in the kitchen!

20:20.417 --> 20:26.124
You need to finish in there.

20:26.125 --> 20:29.124
Give us some of that,
right, fellas?

20:29.125 --> 20:31.008
Give us that...
You know why we don't have that?

20:31.009 --> 20:35.416
Imagine the mess.

20:35.417 --> 20:36.958
It'd be... Oh, shit.

20:36.959 --> 20:38.708
Oh, shit.

20:38.709 --> 20:39.791
Oh, shit.

20:39.792 --> 20:41.207
Oh, my God.

20:41.208 --> 20:43.207
Oh, shit.

20:43.208 --> 20:45.207
Oh, shit.

20:45.208 --> 20:46.275
Oh, God.

20:46.276 --> 20:47.833
Oh, shit.

20:47.834 --> 20:48.850
Oh, shit.

20:48.851 --> 20:50.833
Just get a towel,
get a towel and I'll...

20:50.834 --> 20:51.916
Shit.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.833
Put down a bucket,
put the bucket down, I told you.

20:54.834 --> 20:57.582
Close your mouth, I'm a shooter,
you know I'm a shooter, just...

20:58.651 --> 21:00.249
And women will be like...

21:00.250 --> 21:05.290
Ugh, stop it! Turn it off!

21:05.291 --> 21:08.541
It's on my back, it's on my
fucking back, it's on my back!

21:08.542 --> 21:12.916
Do you know I got
my fucking hair done today?

21:12.917 --> 21:17.541
I can't even open my eye.

21:17.542 --> 21:19.541
So lose weight,
you know what I mean?

21:19.542 --> 21:21.208
That's...

21:22.542 --> 21:26.333
That's the whole point of this.
Lose some weight.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.582
So that's why I'm a little chubby.

21:31.583 --> 21:34.624
Um... just a little bit.

21:34.625 --> 21:37.541
Let's get to the shit, like,
why I'm really here, though.

21:37.542 --> 21:40.708
I'm here to bitch about shit,
you know?

21:40.709 --> 21:43.124
I don't know how to let stuff go.

21:43.125 --> 21:46.541
I'm the don't let stuff go guy.

21:46.542 --> 21:47.582
Like, if I...

21:47.583 --> 21:53.249
If I pass a store
I've had a problem with,

21:53.250 --> 21:56.625
every time I pass that store,
I'm like this.

21:59.291 --> 22:04.457
There goes
that motherfucking store.

22:04.458 --> 22:08.999
And I bet that bitch
is in there, too.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.124
See, I... I get...

22:11.125 --> 22:14.624
I get pissed off about shit.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.499
People piss me off, you know?

22:16.500 --> 22:18.741
And if I didn't have comedy,
you know what I would need?

22:18.742 --> 22:20.791
"The Purge",
that's what I would need.

22:20.792 --> 22:23.290
"The Purge."

22:23.291 --> 22:27.999
Oh, God, I wish that was real.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.165
"The Purge" is, like, the best
concept for a movie ever.

22:31.166 --> 22:34.332
So society can blow off steam,

22:34.333 --> 22:37.666
murder is legal
for one night a year.

22:37.667 --> 22:39.500
Man, you walk out
of that theater like...

22:44.375 --> 22:47.457
Who would I kill?

22:47.458 --> 22:49.082
Like, I don't care who you are,

22:49.083 --> 22:50.666
you had a purge list
in that movie.

22:50.667 --> 22:56.624
You were in there, like,
okay, that bitch is dead.

22:56.625 --> 22:59.016
Even the person you were with,
you had a moment of, like...

23:05.250 --> 23:06.866
Do you understand
that we would interact

23:06.867 --> 23:09.040
with each other differently
if "The Purge" were real?

23:09.041 --> 23:10.207
Like, if you went to work

23:10.208 --> 23:12.708
and your boss was yelling
at you, you would be like,

23:12.709 --> 23:16.709
um... you know the purge
is coming, right?

23:21.250 --> 23:23.582
I mean, I'm not threatening you.

23:23.583 --> 23:26.332
You just acting
real purgey right now,

23:26.333 --> 23:27.541
that's all I'm trying to say.

23:27.542 --> 23:30.165
I mean, I'm gonna do the reports,

23:30.166 --> 23:31.574
but let's tone it down
a little bit,

23:31.575 --> 23:32.909
let's tone it down.

23:35.375 --> 23:36.874
Every relationship, that...

23:36.875 --> 23:42.207
It would always get to,
oh, you gonna purge me, bitch?

23:42.208 --> 23:44.165
Like, we would interact
with each other...

23:44.166 --> 23:47.082
You know, like, there would be
jobs that would disappear,

23:47.083 --> 23:48.416
professions, gone.

23:48.417 --> 23:52.082
Like meter maid. Gone.

23:52.083 --> 23:55.416
Who the fuck would do that job?

23:55.417 --> 23:58.708
Airport security. Gone.

23:58.709 --> 24:00.583
Black women in customer service.

24:03.583 --> 24:08.916
Sorry, boo-boo. Sorry, boo-boo.

24:08.917 --> 24:13.833
Nobody's putting up
with that bullshit anymore.

24:13.834 --> 24:16.024
I'm just trying to return
something and she back there,

24:16.025 --> 24:20.457
well, you need to have a receipt.

24:20.458 --> 24:21.666
Oh, you don't got a receipt?

24:22.758 --> 24:26.416
This motherfucker
don't got a receipt?

24:26.417 --> 24:29.582
I can't see your tag. Oh, Tanisha?

24:29.583 --> 24:30.708
Um...

24:30.709 --> 24:34.958
You know the purge is coming,
right, Tanisha?

24:34.959 --> 24:36.665
You should probably
take this sweater back

24:36.666 --> 24:39.290
without the receipt, I'm just
throwing that out at you.

24:39.291 --> 24:40.958
And it's just one night.

24:40.959 --> 24:44.499
It was just one night,
12 hours, not even a full day.

24:44.500 --> 24:45.999
And they even had an alarm.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.957
Like, in "The Purge",
there was an alarm, like...

24:49.025 --> 24:52.916
Purge over, stop killing.

24:52.917 --> 24:56.624
I always thought,
what if you're in mid-kill?

24:56.625 --> 25:02.124
What if you're just in mid...
You motherfucker...

25:03.959 --> 25:06.583
Shit!

25:07.125 --> 25:10.499
Fuck!

25:10.500 --> 25:15.291
Ahh! Ha ha!

25:17.083 --> 25:20.124
You know I'm just playing!

25:20.125 --> 25:24.082
Come here!
You know I would never...

25:24.083 --> 25:26.290
Sit down, boo-boo, sit down.

25:26.291 --> 25:29.583
Let me go get that receipt
out the car.

25:34.792 --> 25:39.499
I had a list of thing
I call my purgeable offenses.

25:39.500 --> 25:40.708
Things I would purge...

25:40.709 --> 25:42.033
I have a list, it's in my phone.

25:42.034 --> 25:43.791
I add to it all the time.

25:43.792 --> 25:48.708
Like, pedestrians that
are walking across the street

25:48.709 --> 25:53.417
with that "we have
the right of way" attitude.

25:55.875 --> 25:58.374
You supposed to walk
across the street

25:58.375 --> 26:01.666
with an apologetic skip.

26:01.667 --> 26:03.708
You're supposed to hit
the intersection like,

26:03.709 --> 26:08.124
oh, car, my bad,
I'll get out your way.

26:08.125 --> 26:10.749
Oh, shit, you in a rush, my bad.

26:10.750 --> 26:13.542
Here's how people
walk across the street.

26:23.709 --> 26:24.709
Purge. They gotta die.

26:24.710 --> 26:27.541
They gotta die. They gotta die!

26:27.542 --> 26:29.749
Right in the middle of the street.

26:29.750 --> 26:32.541
How about these companies
and organizations

26:32.542 --> 26:35.709
that are asking you
to fax them documents?

26:37.417 --> 26:38.582
It's 2016.

26:38.583 --> 26:43.791
Who the fuck has a fax machine?

26:43.792 --> 26:49.374
I don't even have a home phone

26:49.375 --> 26:54.040
to hook a fax machine up to.

26:54.041 --> 26:56.374
You gotta go to Kinko's
and send 'em a piece of paper

26:56.375 --> 27:01.333
that says "purge" on it.

27:06.917 --> 27:08.716
How about this?
I love going to restaurants.

27:08.717 --> 27:09.874
I eat out a lot.

27:09.875 --> 27:11.957
I love to eat out and
I love waiters and waitresses,

27:11.958 --> 27:12.991
I know it's a tough job.

27:12.992 --> 27:14.808
I know there's
waiters and waitresses in here

27:14.809 --> 27:16.891
and I love you, but I have
a request at a restaurant.

27:16.892 --> 27:19.892
Write down my motherfucking order.

27:22.959 --> 27:26.040
This little up-close
magic trick you like to do

27:26.041 --> 27:30.499
with your little memory game,
I don't give a fuck.

27:30.500 --> 27:31.999
Keep that skill to yourself.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.749
Go juggle in the circus
or some shit, I don't care.

27:35.750 --> 27:37.291
Write down...
You're giving me anxiety,

27:37.292 --> 27:39.749
that's why I need you
to write the shit down.

27:39.750 --> 27:41.582
Okay? My order is finicky.

27:41.583 --> 27:42.916
I'll go as far to say

27:42.917 --> 27:45.833
as my order is
a purgeable offense, I get that.

27:45.834 --> 27:47.666
But I need you
to write it down, okay?

27:47.667 --> 27:51.124
Like, you know... This is my order.

27:51.125 --> 27:52.416
They come over.

27:52.417 --> 27:54.624
Okay, everybody is done?
Okay, cool.

27:54.625 --> 27:56.000
Um... turkey burger.

27:58.375 --> 28:00.457
Wheat bun, lightly toasted.

28:00.458 --> 28:01.933
Let's get the mayo
on the bottom bun,

28:01.934 --> 28:03.582
pickles on the side, no tomatoes,

28:03.583 --> 28:05.791
let's grill the onions.

28:05.792 --> 28:07.899
I haven't even got to
the French fries and the salad,

28:07.900 --> 28:08.933
and don't get me started

28:08.934 --> 28:14.624
on the Arnold Palmer
iced tea-lemonade ratio.

28:14.625 --> 28:16.433
Here's why I need you
to write down my order,

28:16.434 --> 28:18.434
'cause when you leave the table,
this is me.

28:22.875 --> 28:24.624
She stopped at another table.

28:24.625 --> 28:28.916
How the fuck is she gonna
remember all of that?

28:28.917 --> 28:32.165
Is this bitch on break?
Where's she going now?

28:32.166 --> 28:33.457
Now for 20 minutes,

28:33.458 --> 28:35.908
I'm ruining the whole table,
'cause this is me at the table.

28:35.909 --> 28:39.999
There is no fucking way...

28:40.000 --> 28:44.040
There's no way she's gonna
remember this order.

28:44.041 --> 28:45.499
Here come the burger
with tomatoes.

28:45.500 --> 28:49.374
Purge. That bitch has to die.

28:49.375 --> 28:50.375
She gotta die.

28:50.376 --> 28:51.624
How about this?

28:51.625 --> 28:53.916
Clubs, bars, restaurants, hotels.

28:53.917 --> 28:59.624
Any place that uses
cheap toilet paper.

28:59.625 --> 29:03.499
Hey, guess what?
You're not saving money.

29:03.500 --> 29:08.791
I have to use
nine times the amount

29:08.792 --> 29:11.834
just to put a dent into this mess.

29:16.375 --> 29:20.582
You get some Charmin in here.

29:20.583 --> 29:21.916
I have a simple rule.

29:21.917 --> 29:23.624
If there's anything
on my finger...

29:23.625 --> 29:25.750
Purge. Yeah, that's...

29:26.959 --> 29:29.541
That's dookie,
we gotta burn this down.

29:29.542 --> 29:31.708
Um...

29:31.709 --> 29:34.916
Who's in charge of purchasing?
They have to die.

29:34.917 --> 29:37.833
I travel a lot, too.
I travel a lot.

29:37.834 --> 29:39.283
I'm a comic,
I'm always on a plane,

29:39.284 --> 29:40.291
I'm always at an airport.

29:40.292 --> 29:42.833
I fucking hate the airport, okay?

29:42.834 --> 29:44.716
First of all, people are
the problem, all right?

29:44.717 --> 29:47.874
There should be two lines
at the airport.

29:47.875 --> 29:55.416
One for experienced,
considerate travelers

29:55.417 --> 30:00.124
and then one for assholes.

30:00.125 --> 30:01.908
The asshole don't even know
he's the asshole.

30:01.909 --> 30:03.291
It's the dude that's overdressed.

30:03.292 --> 30:04.657
Too many layers. You know the guy?

30:04.658 --> 30:08.791
Three-piece suit, poncho,
beanie, wrestling belt buckle,

30:08.792 --> 30:11.666
janitor keys, pager,
change in his pocket.

30:19.166 --> 30:24.457
Hey, are you doing
laundry on the plane?

30:24.458 --> 30:26.757
Is there some kind of vending
machine on this motherfucker

30:26.758 --> 30:28.958
I don't know about?

30:28.959 --> 30:31.082
And then he's got too many trays,

30:31.083 --> 30:33.416
'cause he's too cheap
to check in his big electronics.

30:33.417 --> 30:34.757
You know the big electronics guy?

30:34.758 --> 30:39.332
Six laptops, a VCR.

30:39.333 --> 30:44.666
Where the fuck are you
going with the VCR?

30:44.667 --> 30:47.332
Check this in, dude.

30:47.333 --> 30:49.666
And then you can't go
to the bathroom at the airport,

30:49.667 --> 30:51.165
because everybody's in a rush.

30:51.166 --> 30:55.792
Pull-out-his-dick-too-soon guy
always comes in.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.708
The guys know who
I'm talking about.

30:58.709 --> 30:59.999
You know this dude?

31:00.000 --> 31:03.332
Just dick out,
early, for no reason.

31:03.333 --> 31:08.124
There's no business for his dick
to be out this early.

31:08.125 --> 31:12.290
Like, this is the urinal over
here and the door is over here.

31:12.291 --> 31:13.331
And he wants to walk in...

31:19.375 --> 31:22.374
Excuse me,
why is your dick out already?

31:22.375 --> 31:27.916
Okay, this is the dick out zone
right here, dick out zone.

31:27.917 --> 31:31.541
Okay, all this was dick in,
this was all dick in.

31:31.542 --> 31:34.165
Yeah, over here was dick in,
this is all dick in.

31:34.166 --> 31:37.208
And then I thought he grazed me
with it on the way by.

31:39.041 --> 31:40.916
You know, I'm peeing
and just like...

31:40.917 --> 31:42.000
Ooh, is that dick?

31:45.000 --> 31:47.499
And it took him too long
to put it away,

31:47.500 --> 31:50.082
I had to step in.

31:50.083 --> 31:51.708
Hey, man.

31:51.709 --> 31:54.708
Can you put your dick away?

31:54.709 --> 31:56.040
What's it to you?

31:56.041 --> 31:59.916
Uh, this is baggage claim,
okay, so...

31:59.917 --> 32:03.290
Your dick has been out
since gate 75.

32:03.291 --> 32:07.499
Put the shit away.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.499
I tell you the people
that get on my nerves

32:09.500 --> 32:10.916
the most at the airport

32:10.917 --> 32:12.650
is when you're at
the gate trying to board.

32:12.651 --> 32:13.791
Now, look, I got to...

32:13.792 --> 32:16.249
I've done well for myself, okay?

32:16.250 --> 32:18.958
I got a lot of airline miles,
I travel a lot.

32:18.959 --> 32:20.249
I'm in the good group.

32:20.250 --> 32:23.749
I got the credit card.
I'm zone one.

32:23.750 --> 32:25.082
They call me first.

32:25.083 --> 32:29.416
Zone one.
Zone one can board the plane.

32:29.417 --> 32:33.041
And you know I got
that zone one walk.

32:35.917 --> 32:37.708
I'm slapping five with zone two.

32:37.709 --> 32:40.082
What's up, zone two?

32:40.083 --> 32:45.624
Keep working hard, zone two,
keep working hard.

32:45.625 --> 32:47.582
I can't stand when
I'm trying to board the plane

32:47.583 --> 32:51.332
and these zone seven people
are standing in the fucking way.

32:51.333 --> 32:54.041
You know, and they're looking at
their ticket like they don't know.

32:54.042 --> 32:55.958
Is it our turn?

32:55.959 --> 32:59.290
Who is it?
Oh, it's not... Oh, okay.

32:59.291 --> 33:02.582
Hey, riffraff.

33:02.583 --> 33:09.708
Can you please get your middle-seat
ass out the fucking way?

33:09.709 --> 33:11.749
People that made good life choices

33:11.750 --> 33:16.082
are trying to get on this plane.

33:16.083 --> 33:20.833
Listen to all these zone seven
motherfuckers right now.

33:20.834 --> 33:23.124
There should be a purge line

33:23.125 --> 33:27.165
into an alligator pit,
you know what I mean?

33:27.166 --> 33:29.091
But I tell you the people
you need to set on fire

33:29.092 --> 33:30.116
is people with babies.

33:30.117 --> 33:32.249
Babies.

33:32.250 --> 33:35.499
Oh, fuck you.

33:35.500 --> 33:37.165
Babies on an airplane?
I'm always like...

33:37.166 --> 33:38.607
When I see the baby,
I'm like, hey,

33:38.608 --> 33:44.165
where the fuck are you going
with this baby?

33:44.166 --> 33:46.791
Whoever you're taking
this baby to see,

33:46.792 --> 33:50.499
tell them to come see you.

33:53.959 --> 34:00.624
Hey. Tell Nana get
her old ass on an airplane.

34:00.625 --> 34:05.040
If she can't fly, get that bitch
on a Greyhound, all right?

34:05.041 --> 34:07.374
But you know people with babies,
they always say,

34:07.375 --> 34:11.541
well, we deserve to have
a real life, too.

34:11.542 --> 34:14.040
No.

34:14.041 --> 34:18.373
No, no, you wanted to have a baby.

34:18.375 --> 34:23.165
That's your life now,
don't put that shit on us.

34:23.166 --> 34:24.716
I didn't get to enjoy
making this baby,

34:24.717 --> 34:29.081
I don't want to deal
with this little motherfucker.

34:29.083 --> 34:31.040
People with babies
shouldn't be allowed

34:31.041 --> 34:35.791
to do shit in public
for five years.

34:35.792 --> 34:40.833
Or until their baby learns
the words "shut the fuck up."

34:44.208 --> 34:46.248
You ever at a restaurant,
trying to impress a chick,

34:46.250 --> 34:49.416
here comes the toddler
cockblocking you in the booth.

34:49.417 --> 34:50.417
Hi.

34:52.500 --> 34:54.498
Hi!

34:54.500 --> 34:55.581
She's pretty.

34:55.583 --> 34:58.250
Who the fuck's kid is...

35:00.834 --> 35:03.082
I can't stand to see babies out...

35:03.083 --> 35:05.457
At a grown folks' activity.

35:05.458 --> 35:07.416
It's selfish.

35:07.417 --> 35:09.017
You know what it is,
you know what it is?

35:09.018 --> 35:11.874
Parents are desensitized,
that's all it is.

35:11.875 --> 35:13.758
They don't know all the nonsense
that's going on

35:13.759 --> 35:14.890
is supposed to be at home.

35:14.891 --> 35:16.749
Remember your friend
before they had the kid,

35:16.750 --> 35:19.416
you would go to their house,
you had to use a coaster.

35:19.417 --> 35:21.582
You had to take
your shoe off to go inside,

35:21.583 --> 35:22.833
the walls were clean,

35:22.834 --> 35:24.249
there was adult shit
on the stereo.

35:24.250 --> 35:30.624
Two years later,
it's Jumanji in that bitch.

35:30.625 --> 35:33.040
Monkeys on the chandelier,
you're stepping on toys,

35:33.041 --> 35:37.124
Elmo is blasting
on the goddamn TV.

35:37.125 --> 35:38.125
And they're oblivious.

35:38.126 --> 35:41.833
Hey! Come on in.

35:41.834 --> 35:43.134
Just step over all these fires,

35:43.135 --> 35:45.675
it's fine,
we're gonna put them out later.

35:46.375 --> 35:49.582
And then they bring
all that to a restaurant

35:49.583 --> 35:51.541
like the shit is okay.

35:51.542 --> 35:53.708
You know what I resent
at a restaurant?

35:53.709 --> 35:57.290
Is that you have to pretend like
you're okay with little kids.

35:57.291 --> 36:01.499
You know, you have to be like,
oh, he's adorable!

36:01.500 --> 36:03.000
Oh, how old is he?
Oh, look how fast.

36:03.001 --> 36:07.374
He's fast, he's so fast,
look how fast he is.

36:07.375 --> 36:09.935
Ooh, his little legs are so fast
in the restaurant, he's so fast.

36:11.709 --> 36:13.040
Let me tell you something.

36:13.041 --> 36:14.833
Bringing your little toddler
to a restaurant

36:14.834 --> 36:19.082
is equivalent to bringing
an exotic bird to a restaurant.

36:19.083 --> 36:20.666
Imagine you're in the back of a...

36:20.667 --> 36:23.666
You just enjoying yourself
and all of a sudden you hear...

36:31.917 --> 36:33.791
What the fuck is going on in here?

36:35.000 --> 36:36.134
Oh, it... It got my bread!

36:36.135 --> 36:39.466
It took my bread!

36:40.667 --> 36:45.499
Let me tell you the difference
between a bird and a toddler.

36:45.500 --> 36:46.625
Nothing.

36:49.291 --> 36:52.332
The only real difference
is how we can respond.

36:52.333 --> 36:55.541
At least with a bird,
you can be like this.

36:55.542 --> 36:56.916
Hey!

36:56.917 --> 37:02.874
Get your fucking bird!

37:02.875 --> 37:09.124
Who the fuck brings a bird
to a restaurant, man?

37:09.125 --> 37:14.124
I'll eat this motherfucker,
I swear to God.

37:14.125 --> 37:18.624
Can't do that with
a four-year-old.

37:18.625 --> 37:20.833
Haven't you been close,
you just want to snatch a kid.

37:20.834 --> 37:21.874
Come here!

37:21.875 --> 37:22.983
Stop moving! Whose is this?

37:22.984 --> 37:26.332
Is this you? Is this you?!

37:26.333 --> 37:29.833
You take him,
you just throw him on the table.

37:29.834 --> 37:32.500
Seat belt that motherfucker.

37:34.792 --> 37:37.417
So annoying.

37:39.750 --> 37:41.541
But I gotta say,
babies are still the worst.

37:41.542 --> 37:43.582
People take babies places,
I don't know why.

37:43.583 --> 37:46.916
You know, two places
I can't stand the most.

37:46.917 --> 37:47.942
The first one is Vegas.

37:47.943 --> 37:48.966
You ever go to Vegas?

37:48.967 --> 37:52.165
And there's the young parents
with their new kid,

37:52.166 --> 37:55.374
you know, the mom's over
by the slot machine,

37:55.375 --> 37:57.290
pregnant with another one.

37:57.291 --> 38:04.165
Hey, you've already
made a bad decision.

38:04.166 --> 38:05.606
You gambled on
the pull-out and lost.

38:10.208 --> 38:12.382
So let's take the little money
you wasting on this trip

38:12.383 --> 38:13.557
and put it in a college fund

38:13.558 --> 38:18.249
so your kid can escape
your bullshit.

38:18.250 --> 38:21.499
Vegas, listen, young parents,

38:21.500 --> 38:25.416
Vegas is over for you,
or get a babysitter, okay?

38:25.417 --> 38:26.983
I should be able
to walk down the strip,

38:26.984 --> 38:31.040
I need some pussy tonight!

38:31.041 --> 38:32.158
Here you are with your kid.

38:32.159 --> 38:33.209
Oh, hey, my kid!

38:33.210 --> 38:35.958
You know what? Fuck your kid!

38:39.291 --> 38:43.791
This is Vegas!

38:43.792 --> 38:49.124
But you guys know the absolute
worst place to take a baby

38:49.125 --> 38:52.958
is a movie theater.

38:52.959 --> 38:56.416
Yeah, you're a selfish bitch.

38:56.417 --> 38:59.165
Oh, I know, Batman Superman's out.

38:59.166 --> 39:02.332
But guess what?
You don't get to see it.

39:02.333 --> 39:05.999
Netflix for you, Amazon, Hulu.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.749
They're always in the theater
like they're helping, too, right?

39:08.750 --> 39:09.750
Shh...

39:10.834 --> 39:13.165
Shh...

39:13.166 --> 39:16.499
Get the bag. Shh...

39:16.500 --> 39:17.666
Shh...

39:17.667 --> 39:22.666
Is somebody making a latte
in this motherfucker?

39:22.667 --> 39:28.165
I'm in the movie
and this woman's breastfeeding.

39:28.166 --> 39:30.124
Titty out, no regard.

39:30.125 --> 39:31.457
I know it was out,

39:31.458 --> 39:34.416
I didn't need to see it,
you know what I mean?

39:34.417 --> 39:36.624
You know how I know?
This is all I heard.

39:58.041 --> 40:03.666
You are tearing that titty up.

40:03.667 --> 40:07.249
I mean, is there titty
for everybody?

40:07.250 --> 40:11.833
I mean, is there chocolate
on that nipple?

40:11.834 --> 40:15.124
Then there's cell phones
going off, and let's be honest.

40:15.125 --> 40:17.290
Isn't vibrate a ringtone?

40:20.083 --> 40:22.040
Your phone is on.

40:24.417 --> 40:25.717
Man, you don't hear your phone?

40:28.875 --> 40:30.207
It's in the cupholder.

40:41.542 --> 40:44.124
Purge. That bitch has to die.

40:44.125 --> 40:47.625
The baby dies.

40:50.792 --> 40:52.192
I personally...
I can't stand people

40:52.193 --> 40:54.040
that don't know how to use
their cell phone.

40:54.041 --> 40:55.666
So annoying, you know.

40:55.667 --> 40:57.966
People are so inconsiderate
with their phones, you know?

40:57.967 --> 40:59.582
Girls will text you
an important question

40:59.583 --> 41:02.499
and then throw their phone
across the room.

41:02.500 --> 41:04.583
Hey, what time's the movie?

41:08.792 --> 41:10.724
- Every guy gets right back to 'em, right?
- 00.

41:10.725 --> 41:13.749
Now we're walking around
for 20 minutes.

41:13.750 --> 41:15.542
Hello?

41:16.083 --> 41:17.124
Hello?

41:17.125 --> 41:19.124
Hey, are we going
to this motherfucking movie?

41:19.125 --> 41:20.833
Hello?

41:20.834 --> 41:24.416
That's when they come back,
calm down.

41:24.417 --> 41:28.541
I'm busy, I'm not waiting
by my phone for you.

41:28.542 --> 41:33.624
Oh, for sure, if this was 1987.

41:33.625 --> 41:35.791
I'm sure you wouldn't
be waiting by your one phone

41:35.792 --> 41:38.457
that's connected to the den wall.

41:38.458 --> 41:40.958
Since we're in 2016,

41:40.959 --> 41:44.499
you're literally always
waiting by your phone.

41:44.500 --> 41:45.708
Too busy taking a selfie.

41:45.709 --> 41:47.959
This is me
not returning your text.

41:52.291 --> 41:53.666
So annoying.

41:53.667 --> 41:58.582
My mom is the worst
with the cell phone.

41:58.583 --> 42:00.833
The absolute worst.

42:00.834 --> 42:02.833
She had to have an iPhone, right?

42:02.834 --> 42:06.375
My mom's not dumb, she just
stopped learning shit in '83.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.166
You know what I mean?
Like, '83 is when she was like,

42:11.167 --> 42:14.165
you know, I don't need
any more knowledge.

42:14.166 --> 42:15.432
Like, my mom has a fax machine.

42:15.433 --> 42:20.332
This bitch has a fax machine
hooked up 24 hours a day.

42:20.333 --> 42:23.749
Who is faxing you, Mom?

42:23.750 --> 42:26.374
She's stubborn.
My mom is so stubborn.

42:26.375 --> 42:28.874
Like, this is an example.

42:28.875 --> 42:31.040
I'm in the car with my mom,
I'm driving.

42:31.041 --> 42:34.999
She looks out the passenger
window and says, Eric, look!

42:35.000 --> 42:37.874
It's Antonio Banderas.

42:37.875 --> 42:41.249
Listen, I don't even need
a long glance to know

42:41.250 --> 42:46.332
that's not Antonio Banderas, okay?

42:46.333 --> 42:48.374
I just needed one of these.

42:48.375 --> 42:50.040
Ma, that's not Antonio Banderas.

42:50.041 --> 42:55.374
She's like, I know Antonio Banderas
when I see Antonio Banderas.

42:55.375 --> 42:58.541
That is Antonio Banderas.

42:58.542 --> 43:03.417
Okay, I'm gonna go over
why it probably wasn't.

43:05.542 --> 43:09.457
Let's open with the 1997 Ford F150

43:09.458 --> 43:12.500
that the dude was driving.

43:14.875 --> 43:17.124
But you know what?
I'm not gonna assume shit.

43:17.125 --> 43:18.866
I'm gonna give her
the benefit of the doubt.

43:18.867 --> 43:21.374
Maybe that's the first car
Antonio bought

43:21.375 --> 43:23.875
and he's feeling nostalgic.

43:24.875 --> 43:27.833
He went into the garage,
like, you know what?

43:27.834 --> 43:31.958
Get me the F150!

43:31.959 --> 43:33.582
I'm gonna give her that.

43:33.583 --> 43:37.750
But I thought the gardening equipment
in the back of the truck...

43:40.250 --> 43:45.916
and the phone number
to his service on the side...

43:45.917 --> 43:49.624
I know my mom saw that,
but she's so stubborn,

43:49.625 --> 43:50.949
she had to come up with a story.

43:50.950 --> 43:52.833
Well, Antonio is a nice man,

43:52.834 --> 43:56.374
his gardener obviously
hurt himself

43:56.375 --> 44:00.083
and he is taking his truck
back to his place, obviously.

44:01.125 --> 44:04.958
My mom had to have an iPhone.
I said, okay.

44:04.959 --> 44:08.791
She can barely work
the remote control to the TV,

44:08.792 --> 44:11.582
so I said, okay,
I'll get you an iPhone.

44:11.583 --> 44:13.165
For the first week,

44:13.166 --> 44:18.833
every first text message
was completely blank.

44:18.834 --> 44:21.875
With a follow-up phone call,
"Did you get my text?"

44:26.750 --> 44:28.791
She figured out
the texting, right?

44:28.792 --> 44:31.133
And then the second week,
she ask me these dumb questions.

44:31.134 --> 44:34.883
Hey, how do you get out
of this window?

44:36.583 --> 44:39.792
The iPhone has one button.

44:43.375 --> 44:48.040
You would think out of curiosity,

44:48.041 --> 44:52.416
she would just press
that one button.

44:52.417 --> 44:53.999
But apparently, that's the...

44:54.000 --> 44:59.749
You know, the... the conveniently
placed self-destruct button.

44:59.750 --> 45:01.999
My mom is on Facebook,

45:02.000 --> 45:03.833
so this is a can of worms
in itself.

45:03.834 --> 45:07.290
My mom can't figure out
that status messages

45:07.291 --> 45:10.833
aren't private messages.

45:10.834 --> 45:13.165
So she's having a full-on
conversation with her sister

45:13.166 --> 45:20.083
about going to the gynecologist
on one of my pictures.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.541
I got friends and fans
and people chiming in.

45:30.542 --> 45:32.834
Man, your mom's pussy...

45:35.375 --> 45:37.874
Now I gotta block her.

45:37.875 --> 45:42.374
I had to block her on Facebook
and then lie to her.

45:42.375 --> 45:43.450
I can't seem to find you.

45:43.451 --> 45:45.082
You don't know what
you doing, Mom!

45:45.083 --> 45:46.834
You know...

45:49.625 --> 45:51.199
My mom, she'll...
She'll ask a question

45:51.200 --> 45:53.749
and the nature of the question,
you know, she don't know

45:53.750 --> 45:56.916
what the hell she's talking about.

45:56.917 --> 45:59.999
Here's a Facebook question
from my mom.

46:00.000 --> 46:04.749
Erik, when I get a Facebook
message on the cell phone,

46:04.750 --> 46:10.374
I get that same message
on the computer.

46:10.375 --> 46:11.959
How do I make that stop?

46:16.917 --> 46:19.124
I was like, okay,
let's roleplay, Mom.

46:19.125 --> 46:20.249
I'm gonna be you.

46:20.250 --> 46:23.040
I'm gonna ask you
a similar question.

46:23.041 --> 46:24.490
Maybe that'll help you understand.

46:24.491 --> 46:27.916
Erik...

46:27.917 --> 46:33.083
"Scandal" came on
on the upstairs TV.

46:38.458 --> 46:42.457
And on the downstairs TV,

46:42.458 --> 46:44.125
"Scandal" came on.

46:47.458 --> 46:49.000
How do I make that stop?

46:52.041 --> 46:55.541
Well, she got mad as shit,
just so you know.

46:55.542 --> 46:58.999
That's not the same thing.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.624
She was like, I'm not stupid,
I know how to do stuff.

47:01.625 --> 47:02.958
That's her favorite thing to say.

47:02.959 --> 47:04.874
I'm not stupid,
I know how to do stuff.

47:04.875 --> 47:07.499
So I'm gonna tell you guys
the moment that I was, like,

47:07.500 --> 47:10.958
do not call me for customer service
for this phone ever again.

47:10.959 --> 47:14.958
Here's what happened,
my mom uses Gmail.

47:14.959 --> 47:17.666
I put the Gmail app
on her phone, got her password,

47:17.667 --> 47:20.165
boom, boom, boom, save.

47:20.166 --> 47:22.082
Now she can go to Gmail
on the phone.

47:22.083 --> 47:25.999
My mom can't remember her
password to save her own life.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.499
Now, she's on the computer
and she can't log in.

47:28.500 --> 47:29.500
You know what she does?

47:29.501 --> 47:34.249
She clicks the link
"forgot my password."

47:34.250 --> 47:36.332
That makes you change
your password.

47:36.333 --> 47:38.999
So boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, change, save.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.457
She's working, working, working.

47:40.458 --> 47:43.125
Let's go back to the cell phone.

47:44.333 --> 47:47.833
The saved password on
the cell phone no longer works.

47:47.834 --> 47:50.792
You know what she does?
Forgot my password.

47:53.208 --> 47:56.541
Boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, save.

47:56.542 --> 47:59.291
Let's go to the computer.

48:02.291 --> 48:05.040
Forgot my password.

48:05.041 --> 48:10.249
My mom's caught in
an iPhone Groundhog Day.

48:10.250 --> 48:14.833
And then she calls me
on my stepfather's phone mad.

48:14.834 --> 48:19.165
You know you got me
a faulty iPhone.

48:19.166 --> 48:22.999
So now, I gotta rush over there
and try to help her out, right?

48:23.000 --> 48:24.808
So I... What I did was I
sat and watched her

48:24.809 --> 48:27.791
for, like, an hour, like this.

48:33.625 --> 48:36.749
Now Google is making
her verify her identity.

48:36.750 --> 48:38.282
She done done this shit
so many times,

48:38.283 --> 48:41.999
like, bitch, who the fuck is this?

48:42.000 --> 48:44.791
So she had to use
an alternate e-mail.

48:44.792 --> 48:47.082
Okay, my mom put
my stepfather's e-mail in,

48:47.083 --> 48:49.916
I just wanted
to make sure it was okay.

48:49.917 --> 48:53.124
I said, Ma, you know you put
Michael's e-mail.

48:53.125 --> 48:54.249
This is my mom.

48:54.250 --> 48:56.124
No, I didn't.

48:56.125 --> 48:58.499
Why would I do that?
I'm not stupid.

48:58.500 --> 49:01.249
Ma, I'm not calling you stupid,
I'm just saying,

49:01.250 --> 49:03.325
you put Michael's e-mail,
do you know you did that?

49:03.326 --> 49:04.882
I didn't do that,
why would I do that?

49:04.883 --> 49:05.949
I'm not dumb.

49:05.950 --> 49:08.040
So I say, okay.

49:08.041 --> 49:12.083
Tell me your theory
as to how this e-mail got here.

49:14.417 --> 49:18.332
This is what my mother said
to me with a straight face.

49:18.333 --> 49:21.166
Well, maybe Google
knows we're married.

49:26.875 --> 49:28.834
Purge. That bitch is dead.

49:29.625 --> 49:32.750
She's got to go!

49:37.291 --> 49:41.582
You know they say you end up
with someone like your mom?

49:41.583 --> 49:45.791
That scares the shit out of me.

49:45.792 --> 49:46.958
That's why I online date.

49:46.959 --> 49:50.749
I like to go...
Online dating is great.

49:50.750 --> 49:52.741
You gotta go into online dating,
but it's just...

49:52.742 --> 49:57.457
There's too many sites for people that
already have something in common.

49:57.458 --> 50:00.332
Like, JDate seems
like a stupid site.

50:00.333 --> 50:06.624
Jews already know where Jews are.

50:06.625 --> 50:07.900
You don't need a site for that.

50:07.901 --> 50:09.541
Black People Meet,
another dumb site.

50:09.542 --> 50:12.833
You know what's the worst?
Christian Mingle.

50:12.834 --> 50:19.499
Christians already have a place

50:19.500 --> 50:23.958
that they should meet
other Christians.

50:23.959 --> 50:25.882
Are you telling me
that Christians are at church

50:25.883 --> 50:26.883
going like this?

50:30.083 --> 50:32.125
Uh...

50:34.291 --> 50:40.290
I don't trust
any of these motherfuckers.

50:40.291 --> 50:44.208
We should go to the internet,
let's go to the internet.

50:46.458 --> 50:52.499
Farmers are the only people
that should be online.

50:52.500 --> 50:55.499
And the reason is
is they gotta walk 65 acres

50:55.500 --> 50:57.165
to get to the next...

50:57.166 --> 50:59.666
By the time you get
to the next farm,

50:59.667 --> 51:00.749
you like, what's up, girl?

51:05.917 --> 51:09.040
It's hot as a motherfucker
out here, huh?

51:09.041 --> 51:11.624
Anyway, would you like to go out?

51:11.625 --> 51:15.999
No? Fuck!

51:16.000 --> 51:18.500
You gotta put a sign up.

51:24.458 --> 51:25.533
Look, we're all online.

51:25.534 --> 51:27.541
That's why I need
to know about you,

51:27.542 --> 51:28.874
you need to know about me,

51:28.875 --> 51:34.041
so let's have all your crazy
on your profile.

51:35.750 --> 51:36.999
I'm just saying, be you.

51:37.000 --> 51:41.666
Be who you are currently...

51:41.667 --> 51:43.749
online.

51:43.750 --> 51:48.958
I don't want to see a picture
that's 30 pounds lighter.

51:48.959 --> 51:50.416
15 years younger.

51:50.417 --> 51:54.582
Whatever defines you,
have that on your profile.

51:54.583 --> 51:56.249
When I shake your hand

51:56.250 --> 51:58.375
is not when I'm supposed
to find out about your hook.

52:03.834 --> 52:06.666
First date is not hook time, okay?

52:06.667 --> 52:07.999
I'm not supposed to be like,

52:08.000 --> 52:11.499
oh, okay, this bitch
has a hook, okay, um...

52:11.500 --> 52:14.124
Hey!

52:14.125 --> 52:15.645
No, all your pictures
should be like...

52:23.750 --> 52:24.950
You should be hanging on shit.

52:28.500 --> 52:32.457
Fuck you, you can't come with
the hook on the first date.

52:32.458 --> 52:36.457
And I want to plan
a proper date, too.

52:36.458 --> 52:38.507
What if I want to do something
off the beaten path,

52:38.508 --> 52:41.550
I want to take you
to make pottery.

52:42.792 --> 52:45.165
I'm trying to redo "Ghost"
and you fucking it up.

52:47.834 --> 52:49.283
Would you use
your other hand, bitch?

52:49.284 --> 52:51.666
What are you doing over here?

52:51.667 --> 52:53.999
No, if I find out you have
a hook, I'm taking you fishing.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.083
You on the side of the boat...

53:00.041 --> 53:02.291
You fucking pull out
a marlin and shit.

53:06.417 --> 53:10.332
Be you online.

53:10.333 --> 53:12.290
And don't have
this picture, either.

53:12.291 --> 53:13.833
From here to here,
that's catfishing.

53:13.834 --> 53:16.165
That's not enough.

53:16.166 --> 53:19.999
I don't know what you are
from here to here.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.332
You could be anything,

53:21.333 --> 53:27.833
you could be a centaur
for all I fucking know.

53:27.834 --> 53:29.217
You imagine you get
on a blind date

53:29.218 --> 53:30.233
and some chick is...

53:34.917 --> 53:37.874
This bitch is a centaur.

53:37.875 --> 53:40.499
Hey!

53:41.959 --> 53:47.207
What? Centaur!

53:47.208 --> 53:48.782
You know, when you said
bring a saddle,

53:48.783 --> 53:50.867
I had a whole different... you know.

53:54.291 --> 53:55.708
You gotta ride her on the date.

53:59.458 --> 54:02.374
Oh, is that your titty? I'm sorry.

54:02.375 --> 54:03.541
You... This is not enough.

54:03.542 --> 54:05.332
She could...
She could be a mermaid.

54:05.333 --> 54:07.266
Just in water, waiting for you
at the restaurant.

54:15.750 --> 54:19.874
This bitch is a mermaid.

54:19.875 --> 54:23.583
We're at a sushi restaurant.

54:24.500 --> 54:28.082
Do you see how
that's not a good date?

54:28.083 --> 54:30.082
Okay, that's all make-believe.

54:30.083 --> 54:31.390
Let me give you a real example.

54:31.391 --> 54:34.582
Let's say you seen
just this picture.

54:34.583 --> 54:36.416
You hitting it off,
two, three weeks.

54:36.417 --> 54:39.417
Get on a date
and she's in a wheelchair.

54:39.917 --> 54:42.125
Oh, really?

54:42.917 --> 54:44.082
Oh, really?

54:44.083 --> 54:46.582
So let me get this straight.

54:46.583 --> 54:50.249
I don't know the chick's
in a wheelchair and somehow

54:50.250 --> 54:53.207
I'm the asshole right now?

54:53.208 --> 54:57.333
Just 'cause she texted
I'm rolling through around 7:00.

55:02.959 --> 55:06.457
And you know what?
Fuck all of you hypocrites.

55:06.458 --> 55:08.624
If this was coming at you
at a restaurant...

55:08.625 --> 55:10.208
Hey!

55:11.750 --> 55:15.791
You'd all be like, this
motherfucker's in a wheelchair.

55:15.792 --> 55:19.624
Hey!

55:19.625 --> 55:21.158
Excuse me.
Is the centaur still here?

55:21.159 --> 55:24.207
Can you...

55:24.208 --> 55:29.624
Look outside and see
if the centaur is here.

55:29.625 --> 55:32.666
What if you, like,
you all the way across the room,

55:32.667 --> 55:34.050
restaurant,
and here she coming in,

55:34.051 --> 55:35.140
I'll be right over!

55:38.792 --> 55:39.833
Is that your purse?

55:41.667 --> 55:43.599
Oh, God, did I spill
your drinks? I'm so sorry.

55:51.250 --> 55:53.570
You're gonna be like, this
motherfucker is in a wheelchair.

55:58.667 --> 56:02.542
All I'm saying is the chair
should be in the picture.

56:05.166 --> 56:07.541
Is that fair?

56:07.542 --> 56:09.791
The chair should be in the
picture, you know what I mean?

56:09.792 --> 56:11.000
She should be just like...

56:13.458 --> 56:15.298
She should be popping
a wheelie in the picture.

56:23.875 --> 56:28.333
That's like every online profile
picture should be this.

56:33.875 --> 56:36.667
And you should be able
to turn it like a car website.

56:41.583 --> 56:45.125
Put different clothes on it.

56:46.500 --> 56:48.108
Let me see these titties
in a sundress,

56:48.109 --> 56:50.916
you know what I mean?

56:50.917 --> 56:52.791
Even wheelchair girl
should have to do it.

56:54.166 --> 56:58.374
Put some spinners on that.

56:58.375 --> 57:02.749
Okay. That part was too far,
fuck you.

57:02.750 --> 57:07.249
But my whole point is I want
to plan a proper date.

57:07.250 --> 57:08.916
Right?

57:08.917 --> 57:11.082
I don't know what...
Where the hell I'm gonna take...

57:11.083 --> 57:12.683
What if I want to go dinner
and dancing?

57:12.684 --> 57:14.666
What the fuck do you do?
You know, if you're...

57:14.667 --> 57:16.499
You know, every guy
would do the same thing.

57:16.500 --> 57:18.417
You just roll her ass
out on to the dance floor

57:18.418 --> 57:20.583
and just fucking go for this shit.

57:21.792 --> 57:23.307
While she's doing
the electric slide.

57:32.208 --> 57:33.249
Two hops.

57:37.542 --> 57:40.082
Please, fuck...
The whole crowd would be like,

57:40.083 --> 57:41.916
Oh!

57:41.917 --> 57:43.625
We doing it!

57:47.291 --> 57:48.716
All I'm saying is
you gotta tell me

57:48.717 --> 57:51.749
you're in a wheelchair
so I can plan a proper date.

57:51.750 --> 57:53.207
You tell me
you're in a wheelchair,

57:53.208 --> 57:59.667
we're going to Six Flags.

58:04.667 --> 58:07.833
We got the good parking out front.

58:07.834 --> 58:09.916
And we get to jump the line, too.

58:09.917 --> 58:11.792
Excuse me.

58:14.917 --> 58:16.792
My boo boo is on wine.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.666
So we gotta go online.

58:26.667 --> 58:28.541
But have all your crazy,
by the way.

58:28.542 --> 58:29.874
Not just physical.

58:29.875 --> 58:33.416
If you got Tourette's,
that's a first date...

58:33.417 --> 58:35.500
That should be on your profile,
TourettesGirl87.

58:38.083 --> 58:40.625
I don't...
Dick, pussy, butt, fuck, shit.

58:41.667 --> 58:44.792
This bitch has Tourette's.

58:46.834 --> 58:49.749
Like, whatever your crazy is,
you gotta tell it.

58:49.750 --> 58:51.499
Like, let me tell you
what happened to me.

58:51.500 --> 58:54.416
I went on this date.

58:54.417 --> 58:56.416
And we about to order food

58:56.417 --> 58:59.416
when she hits me
with this little gem.

58:59.417 --> 59:03.958
Hey, you know I'm a vegan, right?

59:05.291 --> 59:09.541
No, bitch.

59:09.542 --> 59:12.291
Would we be in this
barbecue restaurant?

59:16.291 --> 59:17.666
You know why I was mad?

59:17.667 --> 59:21.040
She didn't give me
the benefit of the doubt.

59:21.041 --> 59:22.374
You tell me you're vegan,

59:22.375 --> 59:24.499
I'm taking you
to the broccoli shack.

59:24.500 --> 59:25.766
We're going to the celery hut.

59:25.767 --> 59:27.182
Wherever the hell you need to go,

59:27.183 --> 59:28.241
I'm gonna take you there.

59:28.242 --> 59:30.332
What really pissed me off
is she smoked.

59:30.333 --> 59:35.291
She was a smoking... vegan.

59:40.375 --> 59:41.833
I told her, I said,

59:41.834 --> 59:44.667
that's like wearing a condom
with a hole in it.

59:49.125 --> 59:50.332
And I don't hate vegans,

59:50.333 --> 59:51.716
I'm not trying to hate on vegans.

59:51.717 --> 59:52.958
I'm just saying, you know,

59:52.959 --> 59:59.541
don't disguise your nasty food
with shit that I like.

59:59.542 --> 01:00:03.499
Don't misrepresent what this is.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:06.249
Like, have you ever
had vegan pizza?

01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:07.582
Ugh.

01:00:07.583 --> 01:00:12.541
Vegan pizza
is like a transvestite.

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:14.709
From a distance, you're like this.

01:00:21.417 --> 01:00:26.667
Well, what do we have here?

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:29.791
And then you take a bite.

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:35.416
Is that dick? I think that's dick.

01:00:35.417 --> 01:00:38.791
There's dick on this.

01:00:38.792 --> 01:00:40.290
Can you get me the real cheese?

01:00:40.291 --> 01:00:42.308
Listen, you guys have been
a very fantastic crowd.

01:00:44.625 --> 01:00:48.457
Thank you very much
for coming out.

01:00:49.792 --> 01:00:52.290
I love you Long Beach!

01:00:52.291 --> 01:00:53.917
Thank you.
