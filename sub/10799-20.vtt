00:02.709 --> 00:06.417
PICARD:

00:02.709 --> 00:06.417
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

00:02.709 --> 00:06.417
<i>Stardate 43779.3:</i>

00:06.458 --> 00:09.500
<i>The Enterprise is preparing</i>

00:06.458 --> 00:09.500
<i>detailed exospheric charts</i>

00:09.542 --> 00:10.792
<i>of the Hayashi system.</i>

00:10.834 --> 00:12.166
<i>Although tedious,</i>

00:12.208 --> 00:13.667
<i>this endeavor is</i>

00:12.208 --> 00:13.667
<i>the first step</i>

00:13.709 --> 00:16.500
<i>toward planet colonization.</i>

00:16.542 --> 00:19.125
Captain, sensors report

00:16.542 --> 00:19.125
the<i> U.S.S. Hood</i>

00:19.166 --> 00:21.083
is closing at

00:19.166 --> 00:21.083
an intercept course

00:21.125 --> 00:22.583
at high warp.

00:23.709 --> 00:24.875
That's odd.

00:24.917 --> 00:26.417
We weren't notified

00:24.917 --> 00:26.417
of a rendezvous.

00:26.458 --> 00:28.458
They seem to be

00:26.458 --> 00:28.458
in an awful hurry.

00:28.500 --> 00:31.000
Sir, we are being hailed

00:28.500 --> 00:31.000
on a secured channel

00:31.041 --> 00:32.250
by Captain Desoto.

00:33.458 --> 00:34.875
On screen.

00:36.500 --> 00:39.041
Sorry to sneak up on you

00:36.500 --> 00:39.041
like that, Jean-Luc.

00:39.083 --> 00:41.125
Robert, why didn't

00:39.083 --> 00:41.125
you inform us?

00:41.166 --> 00:42.875
Out here, you never know

00:41.166 --> 00:42.875
who's listening.

00:42.917 --> 00:45.333
Keeps you on

00:42.917 --> 00:45.333
your toes anyway.

00:45.375 --> 00:47.000
Eh, Will?

00:47.041 --> 00:49.709
Will, you getting soft

00:47.041 --> 00:49.709
on board that luxury liner?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.166
PICARD:

00:51.000 --> 00:53.166
So, old friend

00:53.208 --> 00:54.500
how are you?

00:54.542 --> 00:56.417
Well you know,

00:54.542 --> 00:56.417
they send you

00:56.458 --> 00:59.083
galaxy-class boys

00:56.458 --> 00:59.083
out here to the far reaches.

00:59.125 --> 01:02.000
Me, I just haul my butt

00:59.125 --> 01:02.000
back and forth

01:02.041 --> 01:03.834
between starbases.

01:03.875 --> 01:04.875
But not today.

01:04.917 --> 01:07.250
No, not today.

01:07.291 --> 01:08.959
Starfleet's got

01:07.291 --> 01:08.959
new orders for you.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.542
This is top priority.

01:10.583 --> 01:12.000
They need the fastest ship

01:10.583 --> 01:12.000
in the fleet

01:12.041 --> 01:13.583
and the best people.

01:13.625 --> 01:14.667
That is you.

01:14.709 --> 01:16.125
If time was so important,

01:16.166 --> 01:18.500
why didn't they transmit

01:16.166 --> 01:18.500
the orders by subspace?

01:18.542 --> 01:20.166
Well,

01:18.542 --> 01:20.166
they're worried about

01:20.208 --> 01:21.834
Romulan eavesdropping

01:20.208 --> 01:21.834
on this one.

01:21.875 --> 01:24.709
<i>And</i> we have

01:21.875 --> 01:24.709
a passenger for you.

01:24.750 --> 01:27.000
Kind of hard to send

01:24.750 --> 01:27.000
by subspace.

01:27.041 --> 01:28.542
What sort of passenger?

01:28.583 --> 01:30.000
Mission specialist.

01:30.041 --> 01:32.291
He'll bring your orders

01:30.041 --> 01:32.291
aboard with him.

01:32.333 --> 01:34.875
His name is Tam Elbrun.

01:36.208 --> 01:39.125
As in Tam Elbrun

01:36.208 --> 01:39.125
of the Ghorusda disaster?

01:39.166 --> 01:40.959
The same.

01:41.875 --> 01:43.250
What can I say?

01:43.291 --> 01:45.417
Your orders are to

01:43.291 --> 01:45.417
cooperate fully with him.

01:45.458 --> 01:47.208
Best of luck, folks.

01:47.250 --> 01:49.667
<i>Hood</i> out.

01:49.709 --> 01:51.709
Sir, the<i> Hood</i> is

01:49.709 --> 01:51.709
slowing to impulse.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.500
Mr. Data,

01:51.750 --> 01:53.500
come with me.

01:53.542 --> 01:57.125
Captain, may I come

01:53.542 --> 01:57.125
with you to greet Tam?

01:57.166 --> 01:58.583
You know him?

01:58.625 --> 02:01.208
I do, he was at

01:58.625 --> 02:01.208
the university on Betazed

02:01.250 --> 02:03.709
when I was studying

02:01.250 --> 02:03.709
psychology there.

02:03.750 --> 02:06.208
Oh I see, he was

02:03.750 --> 02:06.208
a colleague of yours.

02:07.166 --> 02:10.542
No... he was a patient.

02:40.875 --> 02:45.625
PICARD:

02:40.875 --> 02:45.625
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

02:45.667 --> 02:49.709
<i>These are the voyages</i>

02:45.667 --> 02:49.709
<i>of the starship Enterprise.</i>

02:49.750 --> 02:51.333
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

02:51.375 --> 02:55.166
<i>to explore</i>

02:51.375 --> 02:55.166
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

02:55.208 --> 02:59.500
<i>to seek out new life</i>

02:55.208 --> 02:59.500
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

02:59.542 --> 03:04.250
<i>to boldly go</i>

02:59.542 --> 03:04.250
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

04:12.583 --> 04:15.291
Tam is a telepath

04:12.583 --> 04:15.291
of extraordinary talent,

04:15.333 --> 04:17.083
even for a Betazoid.

04:17.125 --> 04:18.917
He's a specialist

04:17.125 --> 04:18.917
in first contact

04:18.959 --> 04:21.333
with new life-forms.

04:21.375 --> 04:23.125
He's a very

04:21.375 --> 04:23.125
unique person,

04:23.166 --> 04:27.750
but he's not what you

04:23.166 --> 04:27.750
might expect, Captain.

04:36.542 --> 04:38.083
Welcome aboard

04:36.542 --> 04:38.083
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

04:38.125 --> 04:40.125
I am Captain--

04:38.125 --> 04:40.125
Captain Picard.

04:40.166 --> 04:42.041
Right?

04:43.041 --> 04:44.917
Here.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.166
You want to know

04:46.500 --> 04:48.166
all about your mission.

04:48.208 --> 04:50.208
Everything's on there.

04:48.208 --> 04:50.208
Orders and briefings.

04:50.250 --> 04:52.458
Destination and heading,

04:50.250 --> 04:52.458
all that.

04:54.583 --> 04:57.500
Dee, I sensed

04:54.583 --> 04:57.500
you were out here.

04:58.875 --> 05:00.083
How have you been?

05:00.125 --> 05:01.375
I've been fine,

05:00.125 --> 05:01.375
but I thought...

05:01.417 --> 05:04.125
BOTH:

05:01.417 --> 05:04.125
...you were on Chandra Five?

05:04.166 --> 05:06.125
DATA:

05:04.166 --> 05:06.125
Sir?

05:07.125 --> 05:10.417
Who<i> ... what</i> are you?

05:11.709 --> 05:13.875
I am Data,

05:11.709 --> 05:13.875
an android.

05:17.333 --> 05:20.542
Incredible.

05:17.333 --> 05:20.542
An android.

05:20.583 --> 05:21.875
I can't read you

05:20.583 --> 05:21.875
at all.

05:21.917 --> 05:23.542
It's like

05:21.917 --> 05:23.542
you're not there.

05:23.583 --> 05:25.667
PICARD:

05:23.583 --> 05:25.667
Data.

05:25.709 --> 05:27.875
Oh, you better hurry up

05:25.709 --> 05:27.875
to the bridge with that.

05:27.917 --> 05:29.208
Captain wants you

05:27.917 --> 05:29.208
to run the orders,

05:29.250 --> 05:30.625
scan the technical

05:29.250 --> 05:30.625
schematics,

05:30.667 --> 05:33.000
and be ready to brief him

05:30.667 --> 05:33.000
in ten minutes, right?

05:34.125 --> 05:35.542
Number One?

05:35.583 --> 05:36.917
Riker here.

05:36.959 --> 05:38.542
Will you meet Commander Data

05:36.959 --> 05:38.542
on the bridge?

05:38.583 --> 05:40.291
He has our orders

05:38.583 --> 05:40.291
and new heading.

05:40.333 --> 05:41.500
Aye, sir.

05:42.583 --> 05:44.125
And assemble

05:42.583 --> 05:44.125
the bridge staff

05:44.166 --> 05:46.500
for a mission briefing

05:44.166 --> 05:46.500
in 15 minutes.

05:46.542 --> 05:47.750
Picard out.

05:47.792 --> 05:48.917
Mister Elbrun,

05:47.792 --> 05:48.917
would you..?

05:48.959 --> 05:50.291
Would I care

05:48.959 --> 05:50.291
to see my quarters?

05:50.333 --> 05:52.709
No.

05:52.750 --> 05:54.583
I'd rather get

05:52.750 --> 05:54.583
this briefing over with,

05:54.625 --> 05:57.250
then be left alone

05:54.625 --> 05:57.250
until I'm needed.

06:04.792 --> 06:06.959
I've heard something

06:04.792 --> 06:06.959
about Ghorusda.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.333
Weren't there about

06:07.000 --> 06:08.333
40 people killed?

06:08.375 --> 06:10.959
47, including the Captain

06:08.375 --> 06:10.959
of the<i> Adelphi,</i>

06:11.000 --> 06:13.667
two friends from my

06:11.000 --> 06:13.667
class at the academy.

06:13.709 --> 06:16.083
Hmm, sorry.

06:18.041 --> 06:20.166
Main bridge.

06:20.208 --> 06:21.625
So what happened?

06:21.667 --> 06:24.125
It was a first-contact

06:21.667 --> 06:24.125
situation.

06:24.166 --> 06:27.375
Ghorusdan culture is

06:24.166 --> 06:27.375
so complex and different

06:27.417 --> 06:29.333
that the federation

06:27.417 --> 06:29.333
sent a specialist

06:29.375 --> 06:31.125
to prevent

06:29.375 --> 06:31.125
misunderstanding.

06:31.166 --> 06:32.583
So that was Tam Elbrun.

06:32.625 --> 06:34.375
What happened

06:32.625 --> 06:34.375
was his fault?

06:34.417 --> 06:35.583
Not directly.

06:35.625 --> 06:38.000
Board of inquiry

06:35.625 --> 06:38.000
blamed Darson

06:38.041 --> 06:39.875
for carelessness

06:39.917 --> 06:42.333
about Ghorusdan

06:39.917 --> 06:42.333
cultural taboos.

06:42.375 --> 06:45.417
But if Elbrun was so good,

06:42.375 --> 06:45.417
why didn't he warn Darson?

06:45.458 --> 06:48.625
What was he doing there

06:45.458 --> 06:48.625
if he couldn't sense

06:45.458 --> 06:48.625
that much hostility?

07:02.917 --> 07:05.625
Our destination is

07:02.917 --> 07:05.625
the Beta Stromgren system

07:05.667 --> 07:08.625
following the path

07:05.667 --> 07:08.625
of the Vega Nine probe.

07:08.667 --> 07:11.667
That's 23 parsecs beyond our

07:08.667 --> 07:11.667
furthest manned explorations.

07:11.709 --> 07:13.417
That is correct,

07:11.709 --> 07:13.417
Commander.

07:13.458 --> 07:15.667
Apparently the probe has

07:13.458 --> 07:15.667
discovered...

07:18.166 --> 07:20.041
astonishing.

07:20.083 --> 07:24.125
Our orders are to proceed

07:20.083 --> 07:24.125
to this star, Beta Stromgren.

07:24.166 --> 07:26.792
Scientists have discovered

07:24.166 --> 07:26.792
it is in the final stages

07:26.834 --> 07:29.917
of an alternating cycle

07:26.834 --> 07:29.917
of expansion and collapse

07:29.959 --> 07:32.333
and will soon result

07:29.959 --> 07:32.333
in a supernova.

07:32.375 --> 07:35.375
However, the unmanned,

07:32.375 --> 07:35.375
long ranged space probe

07:35.417 --> 07:37.917
sent by Starfleet

07:35.417 --> 07:37.917
to observe the process

07:37.959 --> 07:39.542
has discovered

07:37.959 --> 07:39.542
something much more.

07:39.583 --> 07:41.917
Oh, oh, Data,

07:39.583 --> 07:41.917
don't waste time.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.542
They call it "Tin Man".

07:46.583 --> 07:49.166
The Vega probe found it

07:46.583 --> 07:49.166
orbiting Stromgren.

07:49.208 --> 07:50.667
Looks like

07:49.208 --> 07:50.667
some kind of ship.

07:50.709 --> 07:52.625
Its energy source

07:50.709 --> 07:52.625
is unknown.

07:52.667 --> 07:54.542
The people who have studied

07:52.667 --> 07:54.542
the transmissions

07:54.583 --> 07:55.959
think it's a starship.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.083
And they're sure

07:56.000 --> 07:59.083
it's alive.

08:00.458 --> 08:02.792
Alive? How?

08:04.625 --> 08:06.542
A cybernetic organism,

08:04.625 --> 08:06.542
like the Borg?

08:06.583 --> 08:08.625
No, no, no.

08:08.667 --> 08:11.291
Here.

08:11.333 --> 08:14.000
Starfleet believes

08:11.333 --> 08:14.000
it's an organic creature

08:14.041 --> 08:16.166
born in space,

08:14.041 --> 08:16.166
living its life

08:16.208 --> 08:18.500
in the wastes

08:16.208 --> 08:18.500
between the stars.

08:18.542 --> 08:20.583
No one knows

08:18.542 --> 08:20.583
where it came from

08:20.625 --> 08:23.125
or why it's here.

08:23.166 --> 08:24.959
But we're going

08:23.166 --> 08:24.959
to meet it.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.917
We're going to talk to it.

08:28.417 --> 08:30.291
I'm going to talk to it.

08:30.333 --> 08:31.709
Have attempts been made...

08:31.750 --> 08:32.750
To communicate

08:31.750 --> 08:32.750
with it by subspace?

08:32.792 --> 08:34.583
Of course,

08:32.792 --> 08:34.583
linguacode,

08:34.625 --> 08:36.542
universal translation,

08:34.625 --> 08:36.542
all that, it won't work.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.000
Tin Man is too different.

08:38.041 --> 08:40.709
Direct mind-to-mind contact

08:38.041 --> 08:40.709
is our only hope.

08:42.208 --> 08:45.250
The opportunity for discovery

08:42.208 --> 08:45.250
is extraordinary,

08:45.291 --> 08:47.917
but I don't understand

08:45.291 --> 08:47.917
Starfleet's urgency.

08:47.959 --> 08:49.208
Romulans.

08:49.250 --> 08:50.792
Oh, hell, I forgot.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.041
The Romulans.

08:52.083 --> 08:54.542
They claim

08:52.083 --> 08:54.542
that sector of space

08:54.583 --> 08:56.458
where Beta Stromgren

08:54.583 --> 08:56.458
is located.

08:56.500 --> 09:00.250
The Romulans claim<i> all</i> that

08:56.500 --> 09:00.250
is in their field of vision.

09:00.291 --> 09:01.542
They routinely monitor

09:01.583 --> 09:03.709
the telemetry of

09:01.583 --> 09:03.709
our deep space probes.

09:03.750 --> 09:05.417
And they will certainly be

09:03.750 --> 09:05.417
sending a ship of their own

09:05.458 --> 09:07.875
to investigate

09:05.458 --> 09:07.875
this "Tin Man."

09:07.917 --> 09:09.125
No.

09:09.166 --> 09:11.166
Actually,

09:09.166 --> 09:11.166
they're sending two.

09:11.208 --> 09:13.083
Data?

09:13.125 --> 09:14.583
That is correct.

09:14.625 --> 09:18.792
Starbase 123 has detected

09:14.625 --> 09:18.792
two D'deridex-class cruisers

09:18.834 --> 09:20.375
on an intercept course.

09:20.417 --> 09:22.083
The top speed

09:20.417 --> 09:22.083
of this class cruiser

09:22.125 --> 09:23.709
is known to be

09:22.125 --> 09:23.709
less than ours.

09:23.750 --> 09:26.125
Therefore, we do have

09:23.750 --> 09:26.125
some advantage.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.208
Then it's a race.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.500
An alien intelligence,

09:33.542 --> 09:37.083
a new life-form

09:33.542 --> 09:37.083
representing a technology

09:37.125 --> 09:40.500
far beyond either the Romulans

09:37.125 --> 09:40.500
or ourselves.

09:42.500 --> 09:46.583
The Romulans will certainly take

09:42.500 --> 09:46.583
whatever measures are required

09:46.625 --> 09:49.583
to secure

09:46.625 --> 09:49.583
this creature for study.

09:49.625 --> 09:52.333
Study as in

09:49.625 --> 09:52.333
"dissecting," I'd bet.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.375
Mr. Data,

09:53.375 --> 09:55.375
you are our resident

09:55.417 --> 09:57.250
honor student

09:55.417 --> 09:57.250
in exobiology.

09:57.291 --> 10:00.709
I'm assigning you to head up the

09:57.291 --> 10:00.709
life sciences on this mission.

10:00.750 --> 10:03.000
Aye, sir.

10:00.750 --> 10:03.000
Excellent.

10:04.333 --> 10:05.959
Meeting adjourned, then.

10:09.625 --> 10:11.625
So, Data,

10:09.625 --> 10:11.625
I guess you're the brains

10:11.667 --> 10:13.458
of this outfit, huh?

10:13.500 --> 10:17.333
Mr. Elbrun, one of the reasons

10:13.500 --> 10:17.333
I'm asking you to work closely

10:17.375 --> 10:20.083
with a member of my staff

10:17.375 --> 10:20.083
is to avoid...

10:20.125 --> 10:22.792
<i>further</i> omissions.

10:22.834 --> 10:24.083
The possibility

10:22.834 --> 10:24.083
of an encounter

10:24.125 --> 10:25.458
with the Romulans

10:24.125 --> 10:25.458
on this mission

10:25.500 --> 10:27.709
is hardly trivial,

10:25.500 --> 10:27.709
and yet....

10:27.750 --> 10:30.041
All right, all right.

10:30.083 --> 10:32.959
I should have brought up

10:30.083 --> 10:32.959
the Romulans earlier,

10:33.000 --> 10:35.709
but I was distracted.

10:37.125 --> 10:38.625
And no, Billy Boy,

10:38.667 --> 10:40.667
I wasn't distracted

10:38.667 --> 10:40.667
on Ghorusda.

10:40.709 --> 10:43.875
If Darson had listened to me,

10:40.709 --> 10:43.875
no one would have died.

10:46.709 --> 10:48.583
No?

10:48.625 --> 10:51.875
Well, I don't care whether

10:48.625 --> 10:51.875
you believe that or not.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.458
PICARD:

11:01.000 --> 11:02.458
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

11:01.000 --> 11:02.458
<i>supplemental:</i>

11:02.500 --> 11:04.291
<i>Traveling at high warp,</i>

11:02.500 --> 11:04.291
<i>we are still</i>

11:04.333 --> 11:06.709
<i>several days from rendezvous</i>

11:04.333 --> 11:06.709
<i>with the mysterious entity</i>

11:06.750 --> 11:09.792
<i>which Starfleet has</i>

11:06.750 --> 11:09.792
<i>christened "Tin Man."</i>

11:09.834 --> 11:12.583
<i>My immediate concern is</i>

11:09.834 --> 11:12.583
<i>with Tam Elbrun.</i>

11:12.625 --> 11:14.500
<i>Starfleet considers</i>

11:12.625 --> 11:14.500
<i>his unique abilities</i>

11:14.542 --> 11:15.667
<i>crucial to our mission,</i>

11:15.709 --> 11:19.750
<i>yet he seems to me</i>

11:15.709 --> 11:19.750
<i>unstable.</i>

11:19.792 --> 11:22.917
Well, according to his medical

11:19.792 --> 11:22.917
records and psych profile,

11:22.959 --> 11:25.458
he's very high

11:22.959 --> 11:25.458
on the E.S.P. scale.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.709
A sort of prodigy.

11:27.750 --> 11:31.208
A prodigy?

11:27.750 --> 11:31.208
In what sense?

11:31.250 --> 11:33.125
Well, in most Betazoids,

11:33.166 --> 11:35.875
our telepathic gifts

11:33.166 --> 11:35.875
develop at adolescence.

11:35.917 --> 11:38.208
You mean you're not

11:35.917 --> 11:38.208
born reading minds?

11:38.250 --> 11:41.875
No, except for some reason

11:38.250 --> 11:41.875
that no one understands,

11:41.917 --> 11:45.208
occasionally a Betazoid child

11:41.917 --> 11:45.208
is born different.

11:45.250 --> 11:46.583
How different?

11:46.625 --> 11:48.875
Born with its telepathic

11:46.625 --> 11:48.875
abilities switched on.

11:48.917 --> 11:52.709
Most Betazoids born like that

11:48.917 --> 11:52.709
never lead a normal life.

11:52.750 --> 11:54.959
The noise of other people's

11:52.750 --> 11:54.959
thoughts and feelings

11:55.000 --> 11:56.709
must be overwhelming,

11:56.750 --> 11:59.500
incomprehensible,

11:56.750 --> 11:59.500
especially to a child.

11:59.542 --> 12:01.291
And painful.

12:01.333 --> 12:04.041
Early diagnosis

12:01.333 --> 12:04.041
and special training

12:04.083 --> 12:05.959
did help Tam adjust,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.291
but he has

12:06.000 --> 12:08.291
some problems.

12:09.375 --> 12:13.333
You mentioned

12:09.375 --> 12:13.333
a hospitalization.

12:13.375 --> 12:17.250
For stress-- repeatedly,

12:13.375 --> 12:17.250
throughout his life.

12:17.291 --> 12:21.041
I always wonder

12:17.291 --> 12:21.041
what holds one person together

12:21.083 --> 12:22.333
through that

12:21.083 --> 12:22.333
kind of struggle

12:22.375 --> 12:23.625
while another

12:22.375 --> 12:23.625
goes under?

12:23.667 --> 12:25.500
Yes, well,

12:25.542 --> 12:28.917
he's evidently done more

12:25.542 --> 12:28.917
than "hold together."

12:28.959 --> 12:32.208
He's the indispensable man--

12:32.250 --> 12:35.542
the Federation's finest

12:32.250 --> 12:35.542
specialist in communication

12:35.583 --> 12:36.917
with unknown life-forms.

12:36.959 --> 12:38.917
The more unusual

12:36.959 --> 12:38.917
the life-form,

12:38.959 --> 12:40.792
the better he likes it.

12:40.834 --> 12:43.667
His personnel file shows

12:40.834 --> 12:43.667
he's gravitated towards

12:43.709 --> 12:47.000
assignments that isolate him

12:43.709 --> 12:47.000
from other humanoids.

12:51.834 --> 12:54.250
Commander Data,

12:51.834 --> 12:54.250
I'm picking up an unusual echo

12:54.291 --> 12:56.041
on my navigational

12:54.291 --> 12:56.041
sensors.

12:56.083 --> 12:57.834
Something is

12:56.083 --> 12:57.834
out there, sir,

12:57.875 --> 13:01.083
tracking us, matching

12:57.875 --> 13:01.083
our speed and heading.

13:01.125 --> 13:03.333
Something which does

13:01.125 --> 13:03.333
not fully register

13:03.375 --> 13:05.166
on our instruments.

13:09.917 --> 13:12.083
Since there is

13:09.917 --> 13:12.083
no known natural phenomenon

13:12.125 --> 13:14.709
capable of travel

13:12.125 --> 13:14.709
at warp velocity,

13:14.750 --> 13:16.750
there are but

13:14.750 --> 13:16.750
two possibilities.

13:16.792 --> 13:19.041
Either it is a sensor

13:16.792 --> 13:19.041
malfunction,

13:19.083 --> 13:21.542
or another ship is

13:19.083 --> 13:21.542
following us covertly.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.709
It is not

13:21.583 --> 13:23.709
a sensor malfunction.

13:24.667 --> 13:26.417
Agreed.

13:27.458 --> 13:28.917
WESLEY:

13:27.458 --> 13:28.917
But, Commander,

13:28.959 --> 13:32.542
if it is a Romulan ship,

13:28.959 --> 13:32.542
with their cloaking device,

13:32.583 --> 13:34.291
we shouldn't

13:32.583 --> 13:34.291
pick them up at all.

13:34.333 --> 13:36.041
Unless they're pulling so much

13:34.333 --> 13:36.041
power for something else

13:36.083 --> 13:38.208
that they can't

13:36.083 --> 13:38.208
fully cloak.

13:38.250 --> 13:39.542
Like what?

13:40.583 --> 13:42.166
Ask the Romulans...

13:42.208 --> 13:43.667
if it is the Romulans.

13:43.709 --> 13:45.709
DATA:

13:43.709 --> 13:45.709
Lieutenant,

13:43.709 --> 13:45.709
continue monitoring

13:45.750 --> 13:47.709
the precise position

13:45.750 --> 13:47.709
of the echo.

13:47.750 --> 13:50.166
Any sudden change

13:47.750 --> 13:50.166
in its behavior,

13:50.208 --> 13:51.875
initiate yellow alert.

13:51.917 --> 13:53.250
Aye, sir.

13:57.667 --> 13:59.625
(<i> door chimes</i> )

13:59.667 --> 14:01.000
Come in.

14:06.166 --> 14:09.291
How are things

14:06.166 --> 14:09.291
in the land of the living?

14:10.709 --> 14:13.208
I thought

14:10.709 --> 14:13.208
you might be lonely.

14:13.250 --> 14:15.875
No one sees you

14:13.250 --> 14:15.875
except Data.

14:15.917 --> 14:18.250
Lonely?

14:18.291 --> 14:22.083
I can hear everything that

14:18.291 --> 14:22.083
everyone on this ship thinks,

14:22.125 --> 14:23.917
and no one besides<i> you</i>

14:23.959 --> 14:26.417
seems to be missing

14:23.959 --> 14:26.417
my charming...

14:26.458 --> 14:27.959
You want them

14:26.458 --> 14:27.959
to dislike you.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.542
Why?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.542
Because I'm not

14:28.000 --> 14:30.542
a nice man.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.083
Okay, okay.

14:36.291 --> 14:38.625
Because they scare me.

14:39.834 --> 14:41.291
There are

14:39.834 --> 14:41.291
too many minds.

14:41.333 --> 14:42.834
I can't shut them out.

14:42.875 --> 14:44.166
Never could learn.

14:44.208 --> 14:46.000
All their loves,

14:46.041 --> 14:48.875
their hates,

14:46.041 --> 14:48.875
their fears,

14:48.917 --> 14:51.208
their needs.

14:51.250 --> 14:53.917
It's like a tide

14:51.250 --> 14:53.917
that never ebbs.

14:53.959 --> 14:55.709
I could drown.

15:02.041 --> 15:04.333
I remember.

15:04.375 --> 15:08.000
You understood,

15:04.375 --> 15:08.000
at least a little,

15:08.041 --> 15:09.959
how I felt.

15:13.625 --> 15:17.083
I see you finally found

15:13.625 --> 15:17.083
a place to fit in,

15:17.125 --> 15:19.083
people to care about.

15:19.125 --> 15:21.125
And you're

15:19.125 --> 15:21.125
still looking.

15:25.667 --> 15:29.375
And then

15:25.667 --> 15:29.375
there's Ghorusda.

15:29.417 --> 15:32.291
I have enough doubt

15:29.417 --> 15:32.291
in my reliability

15:32.333 --> 15:34.875
without having to listen

15:32.333 --> 15:34.875
to Riker's and Picard's.

15:36.125 --> 15:37.208
What happened there?

15:37.250 --> 15:39.291
I thought everyone knew.

15:39.333 --> 15:42.792
No. What happened to<i> you?</i>

15:46.792 --> 15:50.625
Maybe I got too involved

15:46.792 --> 15:50.625
with the Ghorusdans,

15:50.667 --> 15:52.125
with their point of view.

15:52.166 --> 15:54.041
It happens to me.

15:54.083 --> 15:56.917
I wanted everyone

15:54.083 --> 15:56.917
to get along.

16:00.792 --> 16:03.917
I could have warned Darson

16:00.792 --> 16:03.917
more forcefully.

16:05.750 --> 16:08.333
So, after that,

16:05.750 --> 16:08.333
you ran away.

16:10.083 --> 16:11.583
The last I heard,

16:11.625 --> 16:13.750
you were the only

16:11.625 --> 16:13.750
Federation delegate

16:13.792 --> 16:15.041
assigned

16:13.792 --> 16:15.041
to Chandra Five.

16:15.083 --> 16:19.041
Oh, beautiful creatures,

16:15.083 --> 16:19.041
the Chandrans.

16:20.333 --> 16:24.125
Their minds are glacial.

16:24.166 --> 16:25.875
They have a lovely

16:24.166 --> 16:25.875
three-day ritual

16:25.917 --> 16:28.417
for saying "hello."

16:28.458 --> 16:32.625
Peaceful,

16:28.458 --> 16:32.625
untroubled people.

16:32.667 --> 16:34.375
Unlike humanoids?

16:35.959 --> 16:39.166
Well, except for

16:35.959 --> 16:39.166
your friend, Data.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.583
I like him.

16:42.625 --> 16:46.458
He's... restful.

16:48.583 --> 16:52.291
I believe your impression

16:48.583 --> 16:52.291
of Data is probably unique.

16:53.583 --> 16:55.792
Yeah?

16:55.834 --> 16:59.250
Well, having to get

16:55.834 --> 16:59.250
to know someone,

16:59.291 --> 17:02.917
just once,

16:59.291 --> 17:02.917
has its appeal.

17:02.959 --> 17:04.959
I mean,

17:02.959 --> 17:04.959
talking to them

17:05.000 --> 17:07.667
instead of getting it

17:05.000 --> 17:07.667
all at once, up here,

17:07.709 --> 17:10.917
whether I want it or not.

17:10.959 --> 17:14.125
But you accepted

17:10.959 --> 17:14.125
this mission.

17:14.166 --> 17:16.667
You could have stayed

17:14.166 --> 17:16.667
on Chandra Five.

17:16.709 --> 17:18.792
You willingly

17:16.709 --> 17:18.792
came aboard a ship

17:18.834 --> 17:20.291
with over

17:18.834 --> 17:20.291
a thousand people.

17:20.333 --> 17:22.667
How could I not?

17:20.333 --> 17:22.667
Think of it, Dee.

17:22.709 --> 17:26.625
This intelligence that

17:22.709 --> 17:26.625
swims naked through space

17:26.667 --> 17:28.166
like a fish in the sea,

17:28.208 --> 17:31.041
totally alien,

17:31.083 --> 17:32.792
mysterious,

17:32.834 --> 17:35.250
not like us at all.

17:35.291 --> 17:38.125
Ancient...

17:38.166 --> 17:40.208
and alone.

17:40.250 --> 17:42.583
So lonely...

17:42.625 --> 17:45.500
for so long.

17:52.125 --> 17:54.041
How can you know that?

17:55.375 --> 17:56.959
Tam?

18:01.333 --> 18:04.291
You're in contact

18:01.333 --> 18:04.291
with it.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.041
With Tin Man,

18:04.333 --> 18:06.041
aren't you?

18:06.083 --> 18:07.709
No.

18:12.041 --> 18:13.709
Well...

18:13.750 --> 18:16.834
yes, a little,

18:16.875 --> 18:19.375
but not quite

18:16.875 --> 18:19.375
on a conscious level.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.583
We're light-years away.

18:23.625 --> 18:26.542
That's impossible,

18:23.625 --> 18:26.542
even for you.

18:26.583 --> 18:29.417
Impossible for me.

18:29.458 --> 18:32.125
Maybe not impossible

18:29.458 --> 18:32.125
for Tin Man.

18:43.125 --> 18:44.875
Status report,

18:43.125 --> 18:44.875
Number One?

18:44.917 --> 18:47.291
We've reached the outer regions

18:44.917 --> 18:47.291
of the Beta Stromgren system,

18:47.333 --> 18:48.542
on course for

18:47.333 --> 18:48.542
orbital intercept

18:48.583 --> 18:50.625
with the Tin Man,

18:48.583 --> 18:50.625
E.T.A 18 minutes.

18:50.667 --> 18:52.291
Grand.

18:50.667 --> 18:52.291
Not altogether.

18:52.333 --> 18:53.750
Astrophysics reports

18:53.792 --> 18:56.000
that the rate of

18:53.792 --> 18:56.000
the star's collapse

18:53.792 --> 18:56.000
has increased.

18:56.041 --> 18:57.834
It could go supernova

18:56.041 --> 18:57.834
in a few days.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.417
DATA:

18:57.875 --> 18:59.417
Captain, we are receiving

18:59.458 --> 19:01.250
relay sensor data

18:59.458 --> 19:01.250
from the Vega probe

19:01.291 --> 19:03.208
including visuals.

19:03.250 --> 19:05.625
On screen.

19:07.208 --> 19:09.583
Magnify.

19:12.917 --> 19:15.500
Remarkable.

19:17.125 --> 19:19.792
Computer,

19:17.125 --> 19:19.792
locate Tam Elbrun.

19:19.834 --> 19:22.000
COMPUTER:

19:19.834 --> 19:22.000
Tam Elbrun is in turbolift one

19:22.041 --> 19:24.792
en route

19:22.041 --> 19:24.792
to the main bridge.

19:24.834 --> 19:26.125
Of course.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.000
WORF: Captain,

19:28.125 --> 19:30.000
our sensors are detecting

19:30.041 --> 19:32.875
a subspace wave front

19:30.041 --> 19:32.875
of highly ionized particles

19:32.917 --> 19:34.750
preceding the object

19:32.917 --> 19:34.750
which is tracking us.

19:34.792 --> 19:37.709
Yellow alert.

19:34.792 --> 19:37.709
On screen.

19:55.125 --> 19:56.667
Romulan warbird closing.

19:56.709 --> 19:58.750
They are arming

19:56.709 --> 19:58.750
main disruptors, captain.

19:58.792 --> 20:00.458
Order red alert.

19:58.792 --> 20:00.458
Shields to maximum.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.166
Arm photon torpedoes

20:00.500 --> 20:02.166
and stand by, Mr. Worf.

20:02.208 --> 20:03.959
Aye, sir.

20:02.208 --> 20:03.959
I thought you said

20:02.208 --> 20:03.959
the<i> Enterprise</i>

20:04.000 --> 20:05.291
was faster than

20:04.000 --> 20:05.291
this Romulan.

20:05.333 --> 20:06.750
In fact, we are,

20:05.333 --> 20:06.750
Commander, however...

20:06.792 --> 20:08.542
Evasive, Mr. Crusher.

20:06.792 --> 20:08.542
Hailing frequencies.

20:08.583 --> 20:11.500
I guarantee that they don't

20:08.583 --> 20:11.500
want to talk to you, Captain.

20:23.750 --> 20:25.500
WORF:

20:23.750 --> 20:25.500
The Romulan has passed us.

20:25.542 --> 20:27.125
Damage report.

20:27.166 --> 20:28.500
No casualties reported.

20:28.542 --> 20:30.166
70 percent loss

20:28.542 --> 20:30.166
to the shields.

20:30.208 --> 20:33.041
Their attack on us was

20:30.208 --> 20:33.041
incidental, Captain.

20:33.083 --> 20:34.125
Incidental?

20:34.166 --> 20:35.750
Yes, to delay us.

20:35.792 --> 20:38.291
Captain, it would appear

20:35.792 --> 20:38.291
the Romulans intent is

20:38.333 --> 20:40.750
to contact "Tin Man" first,

20:38.333 --> 20:40.750
at any cost.

20:40.792 --> 20:42.375
According to my

20:40.792 --> 20:42.375
sensor readings,

20:42.417 --> 20:45.792
the Warbird has exceeded

20:42.417 --> 20:45.792
maximum engine output by 30%.

20:45.834 --> 20:48.667
They seem to have irreparable

20:45.834 --> 20:48.667
damage to their warp coils.

20:48.709 --> 20:51.083
So they kept up with us

20:48.709 --> 20:51.083
by sacrificing their ability

20:51.125 --> 20:53.250
to re-enter

20:51.125 --> 20:53.250
Romulan space.

20:53.291 --> 20:54.709
A one-way trip.

20:54.750 --> 20:56.458
There's one more

20:54.750 --> 20:56.458
trailing us, Captain.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.375
A day or two behind.

20:58.417 --> 21:00.667
Data's right,

20:58.417 --> 21:00.667
this one's job...

21:00.709 --> 21:02.959
is to beat us

21:00.709 --> 21:02.959
to Tin Man at any cost.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.667
You read all this

21:03.000 --> 21:07.667
telepathically?

21:07.709 --> 21:08.959
In the mind of

21:07.709 --> 21:08.959
the Romulan commander,

21:09.000 --> 21:10.542
during the attack.

21:13.333 --> 21:15.458
Very well,

21:13.333 --> 21:15.458
Mr. Crusher, all stop.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.250
Aye, sir.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.250
Commander La Forge?

21:17.291 --> 21:18.625
La forge here.

21:18.667 --> 21:21.750
Geordi, how long

21:18.667 --> 21:21.750
to full shield restoration?

21:21.792 --> 21:23.125
I'm working on it.

21:23.166 --> 21:25.709
Computer, reconfigure

21:23.166 --> 21:25.709
structural integrity power

21:25.750 --> 21:27.709
to feed inner

21:25.750 --> 21:27.709
deflector grid.

21:27.750 --> 21:29.083
COMPUTER:

21:27.750 --> 21:29.083
Unable to comply.

21:29.125 --> 21:30.959
Requested reroute

21:29.125 --> 21:30.959
would compromise

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
operational

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
safety limits.

21:33.041 --> 21:34.667
To hell with

21:33.041 --> 21:34.667
the limits, override.

21:34.709 --> 21:37.458
Authorization,

21:34.709 --> 21:37.458
La Forge, Theta 2997.

21:37.500 --> 21:41.375
COMPUTER:

21:37.500 --> 21:41.375
Rerouting structural integrity

21:37.500 --> 21:41.375
power supply.

21:41.417 --> 21:43.959
Russell, watch

21:41.417 --> 21:43.959
the lateral grid balance.

21:45.458 --> 21:46.500
No-no-no,

21:45.458 --> 21:46.500
that's too much.

21:46.542 --> 21:48.917
We'll have to do it

21:46.542 --> 21:48.917
manually.

21:48.959 --> 21:50.834
La Forge to bridge.

21:48.959 --> 21:50.834
PICARD:

21:48.959 --> 21:50.834
Go ahead.

21:50.875 --> 21:52.625
Captain, I'm trying

21:50.875 --> 21:52.625
to feed the inner grid

21:52.667 --> 21:54.959
by stealing some power from

21:52.667 --> 21:54.959
the structural integrity field.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.500
You should have partial

21:55.000 --> 21:57.500
shielding in about 30 minutes.

21:57.542 --> 22:00.000
PICARD:

21:57.542 --> 22:00.000
You have ten.

21:57.542 --> 22:00.000
Picard out.

22:03.750 --> 22:06.792
The Romulans wish

22:03.750 --> 22:06.792
the honor of first contact.

22:06.834 --> 22:08.375
Let them have it.

22:08.417 --> 22:10.125
You're out of

22:08.417 --> 22:10.125
your mind, Picard.

22:10.166 --> 22:12.166
What if the Romulans find

22:10.166 --> 22:12.166
a way to persuade Tin Man...

22:12.208 --> 22:14.458
I think the chance

22:12.208 --> 22:14.458
of that is remote.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.709
And if you will be

22:14.500 --> 22:16.709
still, Mr. Elbrun,

22:16.750 --> 22:17.750
you may learn...

22:17.792 --> 22:18.792
What?

22:18.834 --> 22:21.083
That being first

22:18.834 --> 22:21.083
at any cost

22:21.125 --> 22:22.542
is not always

22:21.125 --> 22:22.542
the point.

22:23.625 --> 22:25.709
Mr. Data,

22:23.625 --> 22:25.709
while we await repairs,

22:25.750 --> 22:27.166
I want life sciences

22:25.750 --> 22:27.166
and engineering

22:27.208 --> 22:30.125
to continue collecting

22:27.208 --> 22:30.125
information on the alien.

22:30.166 --> 22:33.208
And query the Vega Nine probe,

22:30.166 --> 22:33.208
long-range sensors.

22:33.250 --> 22:34.709
Aye, sir.

22:54.333 --> 22:56.166
You do a lot

22:54.333 --> 22:56.166
of your work here?

22:56.208 --> 22:57.583
Yes.

22:57.625 --> 22:59.166
I have configured

22:57.625 --> 22:59.166
these instruments

22:59.208 --> 23:02.041
to display information with

22:59.208 --> 23:02.041
greater speed and efficiency

23:02.083 --> 23:04.667
than stations

23:02.083 --> 23:04.667
used by the others.

23:04.709 --> 23:06.709
Nice.

23:12.500 --> 23:14.542
A little spartan.

23:15.500 --> 23:16.709
Spartan?

23:16.750 --> 23:18.709
Lots of work space.

23:18.750 --> 23:21.250
Not much room to live.

23:21.291 --> 23:23.125
I don't guess you sleep.

23:23.166 --> 23:25.375
I have tried it

23:23.166 --> 23:25.375
from time to time,

23:25.417 --> 23:26.834
but you are correct.

23:26.875 --> 23:28.500
I do not

23:26.875 --> 23:28.500
require rest.

23:29.417 --> 23:30.834
But you paint.

23:38.917 --> 23:42.333
The creature's anatomy

23:38.917 --> 23:42.333
appears most peculiar.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.917
In what way?

23:47.959 --> 23:50.000
It is indeed

23:47.959 --> 23:50.000
laid out as a vessel

23:50.041 --> 23:52.959
with what appear to be

23:50.041 --> 23:52.959
chambers and corridors.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.125
An internal environment

23:54.166 --> 23:55.959
suitable for

23:54.166 --> 23:55.959
carbon-based life-forms

23:56.000 --> 23:57.875
is being maintained,

23:56.000 --> 23:57.875
yet...

23:57.917 --> 24:00.458
there is no evidence

23:57.917 --> 24:00.458
of a crew aboard.

24:01.959 --> 24:03.875
Tin Man is

24:01.959 --> 24:03.875
a living being

24:03.917 --> 24:06.625
which has been bred

24:03.917 --> 24:06.625
or has adapted itself

24:06.667 --> 24:08.917
to serve a purpose.

24:08.959 --> 24:11.792
I find that

24:08.959 --> 24:11.792
interesting.

24:11.834 --> 24:13.750
Why?

24:13.792 --> 24:17.208
Must living beings

24:13.792 --> 24:17.208
have a purpose?

24:17.250 --> 24:20.542
Or do we exist for

24:17.250 --> 24:20.542
no reason but to exist?

24:22.417 --> 24:24.959
I do not believe I am qualified

24:22.417 --> 24:24.959
to express an opinion.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.834
Ah, Data, you're

24:25.000 --> 24:28.834
uniquely qualified.

24:28.875 --> 24:31.750
You think a great deal

24:28.875 --> 24:31.750
about humanity,

24:31.792 --> 24:33.709
and you're

24:31.792 --> 24:33.709
an honest researcher.

24:33.750 --> 24:36.125
You don't treat anything

24:33.750 --> 24:36.125
as trivial or irrelevant.

24:36.166 --> 24:38.000
You want to try it all.

24:38.041 --> 24:39.542
You said in

24:38.041 --> 24:39.542
the transporter room

24:39.583 --> 24:41.375
that you could not

24:39.583 --> 24:41.375
read my mind.

24:41.417 --> 24:43.083
True enough.

24:43.125 --> 24:45.417
But I think I understand

24:43.125 --> 24:45.417
you pretty well.

24:47.208 --> 24:49.291
It worries you

24:47.208 --> 24:49.291
that I can't read your mind?

24:51.208 --> 24:52.834
Perhaps there is

24:51.208 --> 24:52.834
nothing to read.

24:52.875 --> 24:56.583
Nothing more than mechanisms

24:52.875 --> 24:56.583
and algorithmic responses.

24:57.583 --> 25:00.625
Perhaps you're

24:57.583 --> 25:00.625
just different.

25:01.583 --> 25:03.291
It's not a sin,

25:01.583 --> 25:03.291
you know.

25:03.333 --> 25:06.375
Though you may have

25:03.333 --> 25:06.375
heard otherwise.

25:14.166 --> 25:17.291
Captain, the Romulan ship

25:14.166 --> 25:17.291
is hailing the alien

25:17.333 --> 25:18.709
using their equivalent

25:17.333 --> 25:18.709
of linguacode.

25:18.750 --> 25:19.959
Response?

25:20.000 --> 25:21.166
DATA:

25:20.000 --> 25:21.166
Nothing so far,

25:20.000 --> 25:21.166
Commander.

25:21.208 --> 25:22.750
TAM:

25:21.208 --> 25:22.750
Why should it answer?

25:22.792 --> 25:24.750
What could it possibly have

25:22.792 --> 25:24.750
in common with them?

25:24.792 --> 25:27.000
But you're so sure

25:24.792 --> 25:27.000
it'll talk to you?

25:27.041 --> 25:30.000
Captain, the Romulans are

25:27.041 --> 25:30.000
arming all disruptors.

25:30.041 --> 25:31.917
Yellow alert.

25:30.041 --> 25:31.917
Prepare for evasive action

25:31.959 --> 25:33.500
of the first change

25:31.959 --> 25:33.500
in the Romulans' course.

25:33.542 --> 25:34.834
RIKER: With our shields

25:33.542 --> 25:34.834
in this position, we can't...

25:34.875 --> 25:37.291
No, no...

25:37.333 --> 25:39.291
we're not the target.

25:39.333 --> 25:41.041
It's Tin Man.

25:41.083 --> 25:42.917
What do you mean?

25:42.959 --> 25:44.542
Do they intend

25:42.959 --> 25:44.542
to destroy it?

25:44.583 --> 25:47.667
Those are their orders

25:44.583 --> 25:47.667
if they can't secure the alien.

25:47.709 --> 25:50.959
Increase speed to intercept

25:47.709 --> 25:50.959
the Romulan vessel.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.583
Their lead is

25:51.000 --> 25:52.583
too great, sir.

25:52.625 --> 25:53.959
Hail them.

25:52.625 --> 25:53.959
We can not allow them...

25:54.000 --> 25:56.750
They won't listen

25:54.000 --> 25:56.750
to you!

25:58.375 --> 25:59.458
Danger.

25:59.500 --> 26:03.959
Gomtuu... do not allow.

26:25.208 --> 26:26.917
Damage report!

26:28.291 --> 26:29.750
WORF:

26:28.291 --> 26:29.750
Nothing available yet, sir.

26:29.792 --> 26:32.625
We have partial failure

26:29.792 --> 26:32.625
of the main computer.

26:35.709 --> 26:37.959
It seems you woke...

26:38.000 --> 26:39.792
your Tin Man.

26:50.458 --> 26:51.750
We've got impulse power,

26:51.792 --> 26:53.625
but I've got to take

26:51.792 --> 26:53.625
the warp engines offline

26:53.667 --> 26:55.041
while we recalibrate

26:53.667 --> 26:55.041
the intermix regulators.

26:55.083 --> 26:56.500
How long?

26:55.083 --> 26:56.500
For everything

26:56.542 --> 26:58.417
or just for

26:56.542 --> 26:58.417
the warp engines?

26:56.542 --> 26:58.417
All of it.

26:58.458 --> 27:00.250
Commander, we're looking

26:58.458 --> 27:00.250
at 20 hours work here,

27:00.291 --> 27:01.750
double shifts.

27:01.792 --> 27:04.417
We don't know that

27:01.792 --> 27:04.417
we have 20 hours.

27:04.458 --> 27:06.417
That star could

27:04.458 --> 27:06.417
explode at any moment.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.792
I know.

27:07.834 --> 27:11.000
Okay, first thing

27:07.834 --> 27:11.000
we need to do is

27:11.041 --> 27:12.208
get the main computer

27:11.041 --> 27:12.208
working right--

27:12.250 --> 27:13.875
No, we fix

27:12.250 --> 27:13.875
the shields first--

27:13.917 --> 27:15.291
Commander, whatever

27:13.917 --> 27:15.291
Tin Man hit us with,

27:15.333 --> 27:17.000
it fried circuits

27:15.333 --> 27:17.000
I thought were unfryable.

27:17.041 --> 27:18.291
I'm not worried

27:17.041 --> 27:18.291
about Tin Man.

27:18.333 --> 27:20.500
It's more Romulans

27:18.333 --> 27:20.500
showing up.

27:20.542 --> 27:23.542
Right. First priority,

27:20.542 --> 27:23.542
get the shields up.

27:23.583 --> 27:26.417
Only, let's not have anymore

27:23.583 --> 27:26.417
surprises until I'm done, okay?

27:26.458 --> 27:28.542
Don't ask me

27:26.458 --> 27:28.542
about surprises.

27:28.583 --> 27:30.041
Ask Tam Elbrun.

27:32.917 --> 27:34.792
Your brain activity

27:32.917 --> 27:34.792
suggests you're coming out

27:34.834 --> 27:38.750
of some sort

27:34.834 --> 27:38.750
of a fugue or seizure.

27:38.792 --> 27:41.375
Your blood pressure

27:38.792 --> 27:41.375
and glucose are indicative

27:41.417 --> 27:44.000
of general

27:41.417 --> 27:44.000
systemic stress.

27:44.041 --> 27:45.333
But I'm gonna live?

27:45.375 --> 27:47.166
No doubt about it.

27:47.208 --> 27:48.709
Good.

27:48.750 --> 27:51.709
Because I want to know

27:48.750 --> 27:51.709
exactly what you did.

27:51.750 --> 27:54.041
I want to know how closely

27:51.750 --> 27:54.041
you're in communication

27:54.083 --> 27:55.542
with this alien

27:54.083 --> 27:55.542
and what you've learned from it.

27:55.583 --> 27:56.625
And I want to know now!

27:56.667 --> 27:58.709
I... I...

27:58.750 --> 28:01.291
I just warned it,

27:58.750 --> 28:01.291
that's all.

28:02.458 --> 28:03.583
I've been

28:02.458 --> 28:03.583
in contact with it,

28:03.625 --> 28:05.458
sensing impressions

28:03.625 --> 28:05.458
from it.

28:05.500 --> 28:07.709
It calls itself Gomtuu.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.917
It's old, Captain.

28:11.959 --> 28:15.125
It's roamed the universe

28:11.959 --> 28:15.125
for many thousands of years.

28:15.166 --> 28:17.291
Where did it come from?

28:15.166 --> 28:17.291
How many...

28:17.333 --> 28:18.875
Far away.

28:19.917 --> 28:22.834
Maybe beyond

28:19.917 --> 28:22.834
the galaxy.

28:22.875 --> 28:25.875
Once, there were

28:22.875 --> 28:25.875
millions of them.

28:25.917 --> 28:27.667
Once?

28:27.709 --> 28:32.500
It hasn't seen another

28:27.709 --> 28:32.500
of its kind for millennia.

28:33.417 --> 28:36.125
It's alone.

28:36.166 --> 28:38.542
It may be the last

28:36.166 --> 28:38.542
of its species.

28:41.458 --> 28:43.583
Perhaps...

28:43.625 --> 28:45.792
we can help it

28:43.625 --> 28:45.792
in some way.

28:47.166 --> 28:50.417
Can you ask it

28:50.458 --> 28:53.667
to return with us

28:50.458 --> 28:53.667
to Federation space?

28:53.709 --> 28:56.417
At least persuade it

28:56.458 --> 28:59.625
to leave the vicinity

28:56.458 --> 28:59.625
of Beta Stromgren

28:59.667 --> 29:01.500
before the star explodes?

29:01.542 --> 29:05.291
Captain, Gomtuu knows

29:01.542 --> 29:05.291
the star will go nova soon.

29:05.333 --> 29:08.959
That's why it's here.

29:05.333 --> 29:08.959
It wants to die.

29:10.959 --> 29:13.208
There was...

29:13.250 --> 29:16.542
an explosion in space.

29:17.792 --> 29:21.041
Radiation penetrating

29:17.792 --> 29:21.041
the outer layers.

29:21.083 --> 29:23.667
The crew...

29:23.709 --> 29:26.625
(<i> heavy sighing</i> )

29:26.667 --> 29:28.250
the crew...

29:28.291 --> 29:31.834
died.

29:31.875 --> 29:35.333
Such loss...

29:35.375 --> 29:39.375
empty pain...

29:35.375 --> 29:39.375
hollowness...

29:39.417 --> 29:42.959
Tam, stop this.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.709
You're losing yourself

29:43.000 --> 29:45.709
in this merging.

29:45.750 --> 29:47.583
I know, I know.

29:50.875 --> 29:55.000
Tin Man hurts

29:50.875 --> 29:55.000
and wants to die.

29:55.041 --> 29:56.917
I can't do any more

29:55.041 --> 29:56.917
from out here.

29:56.959 --> 29:58.917
If you want me

29:56.959 --> 29:58.917
to really reach Tin Man,

29:58.959 --> 30:01.583
I have got to be

29:58.959 --> 30:01.583
in physical contact.

30:01.625 --> 30:04.208
I have got

30:01.625 --> 30:04.208
to go aboard.

30:04.250 --> 30:07.000
No that is absolutely

30:04.250 --> 30:07.000
out of the question.

30:07.041 --> 30:08.834
You don't trust me?

30:10.000 --> 30:12.500
No, Tam, I don't

30:10.000 --> 30:12.500
believe that I do.

30:12.542 --> 30:15.291
Tam...

30:15.333 --> 30:19.917
when you reached out

30:15.333 --> 30:19.917
to the alien to warn it,

30:19.959 --> 30:22.166
did you give any thought

30:19.959 --> 30:22.166
to this vessel?

30:23.208 --> 30:25.875
To the danger,

30:23.208 --> 30:25.875
however inadvertent,

30:25.917 --> 30:28.458
that creature might

30:25.917 --> 30:28.458
pose to our crew,

30:28.500 --> 30:31.166
or did you simply

30:28.500 --> 30:31.166
react out of instinct?

30:31.208 --> 30:33.542
Captain...

30:31.208 --> 30:33.542
Deanna...

30:33.583 --> 30:35.417
he's right.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.083
I don't know,

30:37.000 --> 30:39.083
I don't know

30:37.000 --> 30:39.083
what might happen,

30:39.125 --> 30:43.750
but if you don't let me go,

30:39.125 --> 30:43.750
we fail our mission.

30:43.792 --> 30:45.583
Besides,

30:43.792 --> 30:45.583
at this point,

30:45.625 --> 30:48.542
you need all the help

30:45.625 --> 30:48.542
you can get,

30:48.583 --> 30:50.834
even Tin Man's.

30:56.667 --> 31:00.500
Russell, reactivate

30:56.667 --> 31:00.500
the sensor assemblies.

31:00.542 --> 31:02.583
Okay.

31:02.625 --> 31:05.709
Let's do a program reload,

31:02.625 --> 31:05.709
port array only.

31:06.959 --> 31:09.250
Good, that's good.

31:09.291 --> 31:11.417
Computer, run

31:09.291 --> 31:11.417
a level-two diagnostic.

31:11.458 --> 31:14.583
COMPUTER:

31:11.458 --> 31:14.583
Port sensor array

31:11.458 --> 31:14.583
remains off-line.

31:14.625 --> 31:16.125
Damn!

31:16.166 --> 31:18.208
RIKER:

31:16.166 --> 31:18.208
Riker to La Forge.

31:16.166 --> 31:18.208
How's it coming?

31:18.250 --> 31:19.583
Not good.

31:19.625 --> 31:21.333
I think all the control

31:19.625 --> 31:21.333
processes are shot.

31:21.375 --> 31:23.834
But maybe if I swap the chips

31:21.375 --> 31:23.834
from the secondary array,

31:23.875 --> 31:25.583
I can give you

31:23.875 --> 31:25.583
a minimum E.M. scan.

31:25.625 --> 31:27.792
RIKER:

31:25.625 --> 31:27.792
Do it.

31:29.875 --> 31:31.667
Okay, Russell,

31:29.875 --> 31:31.667
we're going to try

31:31.709 --> 31:35.291
starting retro sensor

31:31.709 --> 31:35.291
element 32 only.

31:38.583 --> 31:40.500
You in?

31:40.542 --> 31:42.291
Go.

31:44.375 --> 31:46.000
(<i> whistles</i> )

31:46.041 --> 31:49.625
The good news is we have

31:46.041 --> 31:49.625
partial long range sensors.

31:49.667 --> 31:53.125
La Forge to Bridge.

31:49.667 --> 31:53.125
Riker here.

31:53.166 --> 31:55.875
I'm picking up another echo on

31:53.166 --> 31:55.875
the long range sensor display.

31:55.917 --> 31:58.208
You reading that on your panel?

31:55.917 --> 31:58.208
Worf?

32:00.000 --> 32:02.166
One moment, Commander.

32:04.125 --> 32:05.959
Confirmed.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.875
Sir, the other Romulan ship

32:06.000 --> 32:08.875
on an intercept course.

32:08.917 --> 32:11.250
Geordi, are we gonna have

32:08.917 --> 32:11.250
those shields anytime soon?

32:11.291 --> 32:12.834
GEORDI:

32:11.291 --> 32:12.834
I'm doing the best I can.

32:12.875 --> 32:16.166
But shields won't help

32:12.875 --> 32:16.166
if that star explodes.

32:16.208 --> 32:20.333
Data, you seem to have developed

32:16.208 --> 32:20.333
an affinity with Elbrun.

32:20.375 --> 32:23.458
Troi, you've

32:20.375 --> 32:23.458
known him for years.

32:23.500 --> 32:25.583
How far can he be trusted?

32:25.625 --> 32:27.875
Captain, the issue

32:25.625 --> 32:27.875
isn't one of trust

32:27.917 --> 32:30.458
in Tam's intentions

32:27.917 --> 32:30.458
but in his judgment.

32:30.500 --> 32:33.083
I would trust him to do

32:30.500 --> 32:33.083
what he believes is right.

32:33.125 --> 32:35.750
Yes, of course,

32:33.125 --> 32:35.750
but his judgment...

32:35.792 --> 32:37.250
Is precarious.

32:37.291 --> 32:39.750
The stress of exposure

32:37.291 --> 32:39.750
to so many minds

32:39.792 --> 32:41.834
on the ship is bad enough.

32:41.875 --> 32:45.834
Now he's strongly drawn

32:41.875 --> 32:45.834
to this creature.

32:45.875 --> 32:47.417
I'm afraid for him.

32:47.458 --> 32:49.542
Afraid of what?

32:49.583 --> 32:53.166
I sense that the alien

32:49.583 --> 32:53.166
is somehow calling him.

32:54.333 --> 32:56.917
If we allow him

32:54.333 --> 32:56.917
to do as he insists--

32:56.959 --> 32:58.959
to beam over--

32:59.000 --> 33:01.125
I believe that we will

32:59.000 --> 33:01.125
lose him to it.

33:01.166 --> 33:03.500
That he will

33:01.166 --> 33:03.500
lose himself.

33:03.542 --> 33:07.375
Captain, I agree that

33:03.542 --> 33:07.375
Tam's motives are trustworthy.

33:07.417 --> 33:09.333
And I do not believe

33:07.417 --> 33:09.333
it is possible

33:09.375 --> 33:11.291
that he will

33:09.375 --> 33:11.291
act against us

33:11.333 --> 33:14.500
or will cause Tin Man to act

33:11.333 --> 33:14.500
against us out of malice.

33:14.542 --> 33:17.917
Captain, if Tam

33:14.542 --> 33:17.917
breaks down over there,

33:17.959 --> 33:20.333
we'll be no closer

33:17.959 --> 33:20.333
to accomplishing our mission.

33:20.375 --> 33:23.917
It will be

33:20.375 --> 33:23.917
a grave mistake.

33:23.959 --> 33:26.000
Thank you both.

33:31.875 --> 33:33.458
Data?

33:33.500 --> 33:35.083
I am puzzled, sir.

33:35.125 --> 33:37.417
We have come this far.

33:37.458 --> 33:40.417
Are you not going to allow Tam

33:37.458 --> 33:40.417
to fulfill his mission?

33:40.458 --> 33:43.250
Tam Elbrun warned Tin Man.

33:43.291 --> 33:47.125
The first thing it did

33:43.291 --> 33:47.125
was to destroy a space vessel.

33:48.417 --> 33:50.875
I believe

33:48.417 --> 33:50.875
I understand, sir.

33:50.917 --> 33:52.834
If you feel the risk

33:50.917 --> 33:52.834
is too great

33:52.875 --> 33:56.125
to send Tam Elbrun alone,

33:52.875 --> 33:56.125
then send me with him.

33:56.166 --> 34:00.125
Counselor Troi

33:56.166 --> 34:00.125
understands him better.

34:00.166 --> 34:03.208
But he is more

34:00.166 --> 34:03.208
comfortable with me, sir.

34:03.250 --> 34:06.000
It is humanity

34:03.250 --> 34:06.000
he is fleeing.

34:06.041 --> 34:08.709
Sir, I could serve

34:06.041 --> 34:08.709
as an intermediary-

34:08.750 --> 34:10.417
a bridge back.

34:10.458 --> 34:12.917
A reminder of

34:10.458 --> 34:12.917
his obligation

34:12.959 --> 34:15.583
both to us

34:12.959 --> 34:15.583
and to Tin Man.

34:25.709 --> 34:28.709
Captain, the Romulan

34:25.709 --> 34:28.709
has uncloaked.

34:28.750 --> 34:30.709
Status, Number One?

34:30.750 --> 34:32.250
Shields are at 40%.

34:32.291 --> 34:33.625
We can maneuver

34:32.291 --> 34:33.625
on impulse, sir.

34:33.667 --> 34:35.542
WORF:

34:33.667 --> 34:35.542
Phasers available

34:33.667 --> 34:35.542
on manual, sir.

34:35.583 --> 34:37.667
Computer target lock

34:35.583 --> 34:37.667
not functioning.

34:38.959 --> 34:41.959
Well, let's hope

34:38.959 --> 34:41.959
they're in a mood to talk.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.083
Hailing frequencies.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.083
Open.

34:45.125 --> 34:47.000
Romulan vessel,

34:47.041 --> 34:51.125
this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard

34:47.041 --> 34:51.125
of the U.S.S.<i> Enterprise.</i>

34:51.166 --> 34:53.542
<i>Enterprise,</i>

34:53.583 --> 34:56.667
your presence here is

34:53.583 --> 34:56.667
a violation of Romulan space.

34:56.709 --> 34:58.625
You will leave immediately.

34:58.667 --> 35:01.709
We are not familiar

35:01.750 --> 35:05.083
with the terms of your claim

35:01.750 --> 35:05.083
on this sector.

35:05.125 --> 35:07.750
We are here engaged

35:05.125 --> 35:07.750
in scientific research.

35:07.792 --> 35:09.333
Do you wish to participate?

35:09.375 --> 35:12.333
We have monitored the

35:09.375 --> 35:12.333
destruction of our sister ship

35:12.375 --> 35:14.250
by the star creature.

35:14.291 --> 35:16.250
We claim right of vengeance.

35:16.291 --> 35:18.250
We will destroy the alien.

35:18.291 --> 35:22.667
If you interfere,

35:18.291 --> 35:22.667
we will destroy you as well.

35:35.709 --> 35:37.417
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

35:35.709 --> 35:37.417

Picard to Tam Elbrun.

35:47.250 --> 35:49.792
TAM: Captain.

35:49.834 --> 35:52.166
Report to Transporter

35:49.834 --> 35:52.166
Room Six immediately.

35:49.834 --> 35:52.166
Captain, I don't...

35:52.208 --> 35:55.166
Commander Data

35:52.208 --> 35:55.166
will meet you there.

35:52.208 --> 35:55.166
TAM: Yes, Captain.

35:56.375 --> 35:58.583
Counselor, we no longer

35:56.375 --> 35:58.583
have a choice.

36:24.959 --> 36:28.834
No, no! Too much! Too much!

36:28.875 --> 36:31.333
Tam?

36:28.875 --> 36:31.333
I can't.

36:31.375 --> 36:33.375
Data to<i> Enterprise.</i>

36:31.375 --> 36:33.375
<i>Enterprise,</i> come in.

36:33.417 --> 36:35.291
No, no, don't.

36:35.333 --> 36:36.625
If it is harming you,

36:35.333 --> 36:36.625
we must return.

36:36.667 --> 36:38.542
<i>Enterprise,</i> respond.

36:38.583 --> 36:41.375
No, it's all right now,

36:38.583 --> 36:41.375
it's all right.

36:41.417 --> 36:44.917
Gomtuu is trying to communicate

36:41.417 --> 36:44.917
a lifetime of experiences to me

36:44.959 --> 36:47.333
in a few seconds.

36:47.375 --> 36:50.041
But I'm all right now.

36:52.375 --> 36:54.959
O'Brien to Bridge.

36:52.375 --> 36:54.959
PICARD: Go ahead, Chief.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.166
I've lost the transporter

36:55.000 --> 36:57.166
lock on them.

36:57.208 --> 36:59.500
Some kind of

36:57.208 --> 36:59.500
force field went up.

36:59.542 --> 37:02.792
Confirmed, the alien

36:59.542 --> 37:02.792
has thrown up a shield.

37:02.834 --> 37:06.542
It is blocking

37:02.834 --> 37:06.542
all our sensors.

37:06.583 --> 37:08.000
Captain.

37:08.041 --> 37:09.750
The Romulans'

37:08.041 --> 37:09.750
weapons systems

37:09.792 --> 37:11.834
are now at full power.

37:14.709 --> 37:16.792
PICARD:

37:14.709 --> 37:16.792
Follow them in, Mr. Crusher.

37:16.834 --> 37:19.291
Red alert.

37:16.834 --> 37:19.291
Mr. Worf, arm photon torpedoes.

37:19.333 --> 37:21.375
Aye, sir.

37:44.875 --> 37:47.375
Yes.

37:59.500 --> 38:02.375
There is a large chamber

37:59.500 --> 38:02.375
20 meters ahead.

38:03.875 --> 38:06.834
I know.

38:06.875 --> 38:08.917
I know everything now.

38:08.959 --> 38:11.000
Come on.

38:51.542 --> 38:54.000
Intriguing.

38:58.250 --> 39:00.166
This is the

38:58.250 --> 39:00.166
control center,

39:00.208 --> 39:02.667
where Gomtuu's crew

39:00.208 --> 39:02.667
guided their journeys.

39:03.917 --> 39:08.250
The ship and the crew

39:03.917 --> 39:08.250
existed symbiotically.

39:08.291 --> 39:10.542
They needed one another.

39:10.583 --> 39:13.083
When Gomtuu had

39:10.583 --> 39:13.083
no one left to care for,

39:13.125 --> 39:15.583
it no longer had

39:13.125 --> 39:15.583
a reason to exist.

39:17.542 --> 39:20.041
Is that the purpose

39:17.542 --> 39:20.041
of existence?

39:20.083 --> 39:21.917
To care for someone?

39:21.959 --> 39:24.125
It is for me.

39:25.458 --> 39:28.250
Deanna was right.

39:28.291 --> 39:30.709
I'll lose myself here.

39:48.583 --> 39:51.625
I must remind you

39:48.583 --> 39:51.625
that our objective

39:51.667 --> 39:53.583
is to bring Tin Man

39:51.667 --> 39:53.583
out of danger

39:53.625 --> 39:55.875
and report our findings

39:53.625 --> 39:55.875
to Starfleet.

39:57.041 --> 39:59.208
I'm not going back, Data.

39:59.250 --> 40:01.542
I'm staying here.

40:04.542 --> 40:07.667
WORF:

40:04.542 --> 40:07.667
Sir, the Romulans

40:04.542 --> 40:07.667
are hailing us.

40:07.709 --> 40:10.500
Captain Picard,

40:07.709 --> 40:10.500
if you interfere with us,

40:10.542 --> 40:12.417
we will fire

40:10.542 --> 40:12.417
upon you as well.

40:12.458 --> 40:16.083
Commander, we are prepared to

40:12.458 --> 40:16.083
defend the life of the alien.

40:16.125 --> 40:18.041
Screen off.

40:16.125 --> 40:18.041
Shields up.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.792
Power levels aboard

40:18.083 --> 40:20.792
the alien are increasing, sir.

40:20.834 --> 40:23.041
Captain, the diameter of

40:20.834 --> 40:23.041
the star has been decreased

40:23.083 --> 40:25.125
by 100,000 kilometers.

40:26.291 --> 40:28.333
It's beginning.

40:41.250 --> 40:43.625
Explain to them.

40:43.667 --> 40:45.583
Make them understand.

40:45.625 --> 40:48.083
But our mission...

40:45.625 --> 40:48.083
Is to save Tin Man.

40:48.125 --> 40:51.458
And I will, but he's going

40:48.125 --> 40:51.458
to save me as well.

40:51.500 --> 40:54.834
All my life,

40:51.500 --> 40:54.834
I have waited for this--

40:54.875 --> 40:57.959
a chance to find peace.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.458
Finally,

40:58.000 --> 41:01.458
all the voices are silent.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.125
Only Tin Man speaks to me now.

41:07.625 --> 41:09.417
Don't you see, Data?

41:09.458 --> 41:12.792
<i>This</i> is where I belong.

41:26.458 --> 41:28.625
That star is going to go

41:26.458 --> 41:28.625
any minute, sir.

41:28.667 --> 41:30.750
The Romulans know that

41:28.667 --> 41:30.750
as well as we do.

41:30.792 --> 41:33.041
Power levels aboard

41:30.792 --> 41:33.041
Tin Man are increasing

41:33.083 --> 41:34.750
beyond our sensor range.

41:55.917 --> 41:57.291
Conn, report.

41:57.333 --> 41:59.417
Dead stop, Captain.

42:01.083 --> 42:04.041
Sir, we've been thrown

42:01.083 --> 42:04.041
clear of Beta Stromgren,

42:04.083 --> 42:07.125
a distance of

42:04.083 --> 42:07.125
3.8 billion kilometers.

42:07.166 --> 42:10.083
There is no sign of Tin Man

42:10.125 --> 42:12.166
or the Romulans, sir.

42:16.792 --> 42:18.917
Captain, on screen.

42:31.792 --> 42:34.583
Data...

42:34.625 --> 42:36.709
DATA:

42:34.625 --> 42:36.709
Sir?

42:39.208 --> 42:41.208
Data, what happened

42:39.208 --> 42:41.208
over there?

42:43.250 --> 42:45.667
Difficult to explain, sir.

42:45.709 --> 42:47.667
Tam?

42:47.709 --> 42:51.041
I believe he found what

42:47.709 --> 42:51.041
he was looking for, Counselor.

42:55.083 --> 42:56.834
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

43:13.041 --> 43:15.166
You sent for me?

43:15.208 --> 43:16.959
Yes, Counselor.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.959
It was Tam's final request

43:19.000 --> 43:21.625
that I explain

43:19.000 --> 43:21.625
his decision to the crew,

43:21.667 --> 43:25.667
but I believe it was his hope

43:21.667 --> 43:25.667
that you would understand.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.250
What did happen?

43:32.875 --> 43:35.417
I witnessed something...

43:35.458 --> 43:37.166
remarkable.

43:37.208 --> 43:40.291
Individually,

43:37.208 --> 43:40.291
they were both so...

43:40.333 --> 43:42.709
Wounded.

43:42.750 --> 43:44.291
Isolated.

43:44.333 --> 43:45.750
Yes.

43:45.792 --> 43:47.959
But no longer.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.166
Through joining,

43:50.208 --> 43:53.458
they have been healed.

43:53.500 --> 43:56.792
Grief has been

43:53.500 --> 43:56.792
transmuted to joy.

43:58.041 --> 44:01.291
Loneliness to belonging.

44:03.917 --> 44:08.583
Data, you do understand.

44:08.625 --> 44:10.709
Yes, Counselor.

44:12.125 --> 44:14.417
When Tin Man returned me

44:12.125 --> 44:14.417
to the<i> Enterprise,</i>

44:14.458 --> 44:19.417
I realized this

44:14.458 --> 44:19.417
is where I belong.
