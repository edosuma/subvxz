WEBVTT

00:00.038 --> 00:01.220
I called you here

00:01.221 --> 00:05.694
to discuss where we are
with Operation 225641441636324.

00:06.223 --> 00:07.290
What?

00:07.291 --> 00:09.259
I assigned a numerical
value to each letter

00:09.260 --> 00:11.560
in the word "pimento,"
which I then squared.

00:11.595 --> 00:12.629
Oh, Captain.

00:12.630 --> 00:14.830
How dare you try
and sneak math into this?

00:14.865 --> 00:16.199
Peralta.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.034
Update us on Santiago's
undercover prison operation.

00:18.035 --> 00:20.570
Yeah, she has made contact
with Jimmy Figgis' sister,

00:20.571 --> 00:21.838
but it's slowgoing.

00:21.839 --> 00:23.138
I hope she comes back soon.

00:23.174 --> 00:24.474
Aww. You miss her?

00:24.475 --> 00:25.608
No, I lost the key
to her apartment,

00:25.609 --> 00:26.743
and I'm taking care of her fish.

00:26.744 --> 00:27.911
They're all dead already,
aren't they?

00:27.912 --> 00:29.412
- Yeah.
- Damn it.

00:29.413 --> 00:31.781
Our priority is still finding
Figgis' agent in the FBI.

00:31.782 --> 00:33.316
I think it's time for me
to call in a favor

00:33.317 --> 00:36.185
from an old colleague
at the bureau, Bob Anderson.

00:36.220 --> 00:38.955
I would've contacted him sooner,
but this is a rogue op,

00:38.956 --> 00:40.924
and he's a real stickler
for the rules.

00:40.925 --> 00:43.593
He once picked up a penny off
the street, which he then

00:43.594 --> 00:45.295
reported on his taxes.

00:45.296 --> 00:46.729
Sounds like
a barrel of laughs.

00:46.730 --> 00:48.131
Fortunately, he isn't.

00:48.132 --> 00:49.999
We worked together back in
the day and really hit it off.

00:51.535 --> 00:53.570
We're going to
be here a while.

00:53.571 --> 00:55.305
Would you like to talk?

00:55.306 --> 00:56.706
I'd rather not.

00:56.707 --> 00:58.174
Agreed.

Oh, man.

01:19.230 --> 01:20.797
A secret FBI meet up?

01:20.798 --> 01:21.964
I love this!

01:21.999 --> 01:23.266
Look at all those idiots.

01:23.267 --> 01:24.666
They have no idea
what's about to go down.

01:24.702 --> 01:26.168
<i>You mean that woman
and her baby?</i>

01:26.203 --> 01:27.469
Yep. Idiots.

01:27.505 --> 01:29.305
Oh, here comes Bob.

01:29.306 --> 01:30.707
Please behave.

01:30.708 --> 01:31.808
Hello, Bob.

01:31.809 --> 01:32.842
Good to see you.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.110
And you. Apologies.

01:34.111 --> 01:36.412
It's inappropriate for me
to partake in such

01:36.413 --> 01:38.680
informal conversation
in front of your detectives.

01:38.716 --> 01:40.949
It's all right.
I am equally to blame.

01:40.985 --> 01:42.418
Oh, my God.

01:42.419 --> 01:43.853
There's two of them.

01:43.854 --> 01:45.121
So, Raymond,
what evidence do you have

01:45.122 --> 01:46.788
that there's
a dirty agent in the FBI?

01:46.824 --> 01:47.891
Let's see the file.

01:47.892 --> 01:49.057
We don't have a file.

01:49.093 --> 01:50.292
You're working file-less?

01:50.327 --> 01:51.828
We saw the guy
commit a felony.

01:51.829 --> 01:53.263
He tried to have
a cop killed.

01:53.264 --> 01:55.063
Crazy hot cop.

01:55.099 --> 01:57.133
Well, he's a specific type.

01:57.134 --> 01:59.402
Look, the guy we're looking for
was wearing a ski mask,

01:59.403 --> 02:00.904
but he's about 5'10".
Caucasian.

02:00.905 --> 02:02.771
He's got a big scar
on his right hand.

02:02.806 --> 02:04.574
We've been calling him ScarJo,
like the actress,

02:04.575 --> 02:06.209
Scarlett Johansson.

02:06.210 --> 02:08.342
What? An actress?

02:08.378 --> 02:09.913
I didn't know that was
where that was from.

02:09.913 --> 02:11.713
Bob, I'm so sorry.

02:11.749 --> 02:14.583
- No, I'll look past it.
- Okay.

02:14.618 --> 02:16.286
There's an agent
that matches that description.

02:16.287 --> 02:17.519
His name is Ryan Whealon.

02:17.555 --> 02:19.155
You think you could ID him
if you saw him?

02:19.156 --> 02:22.357
Oh, yeah. I'd recognize
that scar from 20 miles away.

02:22.393 --> 02:23.959
You must have
fantastic vision.

02:23.994 --> 02:25.728
Or it's a gigantic scar.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.763
I was clearly exaggerating.

02:27.798 --> 02:29.231
Why do you have
to ruin everything?

02:30.801 --> 02:32.901
Dr. Schwartz,
I'm here for my appointment.

02:32.937 --> 02:36.104
Hello, Cortez. Shabbat Shalom.

02:36.140 --> 02:37.974
"Shabbat Shalom"?

02:37.975 --> 02:40.043
I don't know.
Jake made me Jewish.

02:40.044 --> 02:42.210
So how are things going
with Maura?

02:42.246 --> 02:43.746
Well, I'm part of her crew,

02:43.747 --> 02:45.181
but she still won't talk
about her past.

02:46.517 --> 02:48.750
So, what kind of stuff
did you used to do in New York?

02:48.786 --> 02:50.499
What's with all
the questions, Regis?

02:50.521 --> 02:52.084
Actually, it's
Michael Strahan now.

02:52.089 --> 02:53.389
What?

02:53.390 --> 02:54.857
She's so scary.

02:54.858 --> 02:57.960
I saw her pull her own tooth out
and throw it into a woman's eye.

02:57.995 --> 03:00.029
Yeah, that's bad.
So guess what.

03:00.030 --> 03:01.331
Genevieve just texted.

03:01.332 --> 03:03.298
We're gonna hear about
our adoption any minute.

03:03.334 --> 03:05.134
I thought you were
doing fertility treatments.

03:05.135 --> 03:06.936
We are, but it's
not going well.

03:06.937 --> 03:08.638
The doctor said my sterility
is so aggressive,

03:08.639 --> 03:10.606
- it may have spread to her.
- Okay.

03:10.641 --> 03:13.643
But, adoption!
Charles, that's amazing!

03:13.644 --> 03:16.145
- I know!
- Oh, no.

03:16.146 --> 03:17.279
- What?
- Maura.

03:18.782 --> 03:22.752
Anyway, Ms. Cortez,
your vagina looks great.

03:22.753 --> 03:23.786
Mazel.

03:26.757 --> 03:28.624
Did you see
this morning's newspaper?

03:28.659 --> 03:30.493
No. I get all my news

03:30.494 --> 03:32.462
from a text message chain
with my friends.

03:32.463 --> 03:35.164
The attorney general
might step down!

03:35.165 --> 03:37.900
I'm kidding. It's a GIF
of a rabbit eating spaghetti.

03:37.901 --> 03:40.770
There's an article about
the Nine-Nine's monthly crime rate.

03:40.771 --> 03:43.338
Those numbers aren't supposed
to be public until next week.

03:43.374 --> 03:45.708
Terry, you're gonna have
to be more interesting

03:45.709 --> 03:47.409
if you want to
get an "oh, dang."

03:47.444 --> 03:49.224
There's a leak
in the Nine-Nine!

03:49.246 --> 03:50.413
Oh, dang.

03:50.414 --> 03:52.548
I presented those numbers
in a morning briefing,

03:52.549 --> 03:55.685
but I can't imagine anyone would
be stupid enough to leak 'em.

03:55.686 --> 03:58.020
Really, Terrence?
Look how dumb they are.

03:58.055 --> 04:01.891
- Ugh!
- D'aww!

04:01.892 --> 04:03.392
Printer's fixed.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.295
Oh, dang.

04:11.035 --> 04:12.869
<i>Tell Peralta
Whealon's approaching.</i>

04:12.870 --> 04:13.910
Here comes the douche bag.

04:13.937 --> 04:16.637
<i>Gray suit. Act natural.</i>

04:20.511 --> 04:22.911
Wow, look at that.
What a great magazine.

04:22.946 --> 04:25.348
Sir, if you're interested,
the new issue of "Clown Boobies"

04:25.349 --> 04:27.315
just came in.
I can unpack the box for you.

04:27.351 --> 04:29.152
What?

04:29.153 --> 04:30.719
Oh. Haha.

04:30.754 --> 04:32.320
Actually, no.
I need last month's.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.724
There's a particular clown...

04:34.725 --> 04:36.558
booby...
that I'm looking for.

04:36.593 --> 04:38.160
What is Peralta doing?

04:38.195 --> 04:40.730
He appears to
be rifling through

04:40.731 --> 04:43.599
"Clown Boobies Magazine."

04:43.600 --> 04:45.667
Whoa!

04:45.703 --> 04:47.102
Stupid butterfingers.

04:47.137 --> 04:48.738
- It's all right.
- Thank you.

04:48.739 --> 04:50.139
Here you go.

04:52.609 --> 04:57.447
Thank you.
Thank you so, so much.

04:57.448 --> 04:59.948
Not thank you. Not thank you
at all, you dirtbag.

04:59.983 --> 05:01.483
<i>Hey, Cortez!</i>

05:01.518 --> 05:04.386
What's going on
with you and that doctor?

05:04.421 --> 05:05.921
You seem real tight with him.

05:05.956 --> 05:08.190
No, we're not tight.
I barely know him.

05:08.225 --> 05:09.458
So why were you hugging him?

05:09.493 --> 05:12.894
My last appeal got denied,
so he was comforting me.

05:12.930 --> 05:16.098
He's a sensitive guy. Maybe
because of his Jewish faith.

05:16.133 --> 05:18.935
I want to talk to him.
Alone.

05:18.936 --> 05:22.438
Oh. About something medical?
Or...

05:22.439 --> 05:25.574
What did I tell you about
asking too many questions?

05:25.609 --> 05:28.811
Right. That's that thing you
killed a bunch of bitches for.

05:28.812 --> 05:31.079
Ah. Got it. Sorry.

05:32.816 --> 05:34.150
<i>We've been watching
this guy all day.</i>

05:34.151 --> 05:35.618
Can't believe we haven't
even arrested him yet.

05:35.619 --> 05:36.786
We know he's the guy.

05:36.787 --> 05:38.521
<i>We have to build
a case first.</i>

05:38.522 --> 05:43.092
4:13 p.m. Subject finishes
his coffee. Or tea.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.728
Mark the beverage as "unknown."

05:45.729 --> 05:46.763
Detectives.

05:46.764 --> 05:48.164
What does the FBI database

05:48.165 --> 05:50.065
tell us about
Whealon and Figgis?

05:50.100 --> 05:52.335
Both of their files
were completely wiped.

05:52.336 --> 05:53.468
I've never seen that before.

05:53.504 --> 05:55.204
Yeah, that's
because he's guilty,

05:55.205 --> 05:57.439
and we're just sitting here
watching him eat a peach.

05:57.474 --> 05:58.473
That's a nectarine.

05:58.509 --> 06:00.409
It's either a nectarine
or a peach.

06:00.410 --> 06:02.744
Just write
"unknown stone fruit."

06:02.780 --> 06:03.980
There can't just
be digital files.

06:03.981 --> 06:05.213
There must be hard copies.

06:05.249 --> 06:07.383
Those are all under
lock and key in the archives.

06:07.384 --> 06:09.152
If I asked for clearance,
they could alert him.

06:09.153 --> 06:10.453
<i>Interesting.</i>

06:10.454 --> 06:12.622
So what you're saying
is our only option

06:12.623 --> 06:16.091
is to break into the FBI
and steal the file.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.160
Don't be absurd.

06:17.161 --> 06:19.661
Bob, I apologize
for the absurdity.

06:19.696 --> 06:21.164
I see no absurdity.

06:21.165 --> 06:23.633
Actually,
I think Peralta's right.

06:23.634 --> 06:25.066
Let's plan a heist.

06:27.304 --> 06:28.837
Bob?

06:31.020 --> 06:34.288
Blueprints for the New York
Headquarters of the FBI.

06:34.324 --> 06:35.757
The file we're looking for

06:35.758 --> 06:37.892
is in the archive room,
here, in the basement.

06:37.927 --> 06:42.464
We will be represented by
these things I had in my pocket.

06:42.465 --> 06:44.566
All I had was lint.
Just a pocketful of lint.

06:44.567 --> 06:47.435
Everybody remember
what your lint looks like.

06:47.470 --> 06:48.971
My lint is round.

06:48.972 --> 06:52.341
My lint is approximately
1 centimeter in diameter.

06:52.342 --> 06:54.309
- My lint is blue.
- My lint is oblong.

06:54.310 --> 06:56.712
My lint is approximately
1/2 centimeter in length.

06:56.713 --> 06:58.013
My lint is also blue.

06:58.014 --> 07:00.749
Wow, so no pushback on
the lint thing? This is great.

07:00.750 --> 07:02.950
Now, I can give you clearance
to get in the front door,

07:02.986 --> 07:05.220
but getting into the archive
is another matter.

07:05.221 --> 07:10.159
If I go into this bathroom,
I could climb through this vent,

07:10.160 --> 07:13.428
drop down into the archive room,
and steal the file.

07:13.429 --> 07:14.563
How are you gonna get out?

07:14.564 --> 07:17.099
Pull myself back up
the way I came in.

07:17.100 --> 07:20.202
What? I can do a pull-up.
Terry will teach me.

07:20.203 --> 07:22.404
This whole area
is video-monitored

07:22.405 --> 07:23.505
by this guard here.

07:23.506 --> 07:24.773
I can distract him
with conversation.

07:24.774 --> 07:25.874
What do you know about him?

07:25.875 --> 07:27.009
Watches a lot of TV.

07:27.010 --> 07:29.010
I heard him mention
"Sex and the City."

07:29.045 --> 07:31.145
Then I will discuss
both of those shows with him.

07:31.181 --> 07:33.282
Ooh. "Sex and the City"
is one show.

07:33.283 --> 07:34.550
It's not a show called "Sex"

07:34.551 --> 07:36.350
and then another show
called "The City."

07:36.386 --> 07:37.386
Okay. Good start.

07:37.387 --> 07:38.987
- Now I know that.
- Oh.

07:38.988 --> 07:40.389
I can disable
the security DVRs,

07:40.390 --> 07:42.457
but I need some way of getting
to a station unnoticed.

07:42.458 --> 07:44.059
I have an idea
on how to smuggle you in,

07:44.060 --> 07:45.359
but it'll be a tight fit.

07:45.395 --> 07:46.562
I'm flexible.
I do a lot of yoga.

07:46.563 --> 07:47.963
You do yoga?

07:47.964 --> 07:49.531
Helps keep me centered.
If you ask me about it again,

07:49.532 --> 07:50.966
I'll hunt you down
and rip your face off.

07:50.967 --> 07:52.734
Okay. Great. Good plan.
I won't ask you about it again.

07:52.735 --> 07:54.036
I got the DVRs.

07:54.037 --> 07:57.906
Actually, that's my lint.
My lint is oblong.

07:57.907 --> 07:59.441
My lint is blue.

07:59.442 --> 08:01.742
Okay! Sounds like we've got a plan.
Let's get to training.

08:01.778 --> 08:02.978
Why does she want

08:02.979 --> 08:05.613
to meet with me?
You think our cover's blown?

08:05.648 --> 08:07.115
I don't know,
but, just to be safe,

08:07.116 --> 08:08.550
let's review your backstory.

08:08.551 --> 08:12.120
I went to Yeshiva med school,
residency at Mount Sinai,

08:12.121 --> 08:13.555
my best friend
is Yacob Peralberg,

17:39.981 --> 17:41.615
Great. That means he'll
definitely testify

17:41.616 --> 17:43.584
against Figgis,
and you know what that means:

17:43.585 --> 17:46.219
time for celebration candy bars!

17:46.254 --> 17:47.787
Stupid hospital vending machines

17:47.822 --> 17:49.989
didn't have alcohol
for some weird reason. Here.

17:50.025 --> 17:53.427
Why not? I really have
embraced my wild side today.

17:53.428 --> 17:54.929
As have I.

17:54.930 --> 17:57.131
Chocolate and nuts.

17:57.132 --> 17:58.564
Actually, that's overkill.

17:58.600 --> 17:59.667
Indeed.

17:59.668 --> 18:01.235
I'll wait here,

18:01.236 --> 18:02.835
so I can interrogate him
when he wakes up.

18:02.871 --> 18:04.171
I'll keep you company.

18:04.172 --> 18:05.940
Why don't you two
go home and get some sleep?

18:05.941 --> 18:07.074
Good idea, sir.

18:07.075 --> 18:08.309
We'll head to the bar,
get super drunk,

18:08.310 --> 18:09.543
and then head home
and get some sleep.

18:09.544 --> 18:11.044
Yeah.
Good idea, sir.

18:12.847 --> 18:16.349
Turns out your sensitive
doctor isn't who he says he is.

18:16.384 --> 18:18.284
What? What do you mean?
Why?

18:18.320 --> 18:21.287
'Cause he's about to adopt
a baby with his chiropractor.

18:21.323 --> 18:23.623
Oh, thank God...

18:23.658 --> 18:26.893
that you didn't invest more time
in a relationship

18:26.928 --> 18:28.696
with that jerk.

18:28.697 --> 18:30.330
Why can't I find a good man?

18:30.365 --> 18:32.333
Could be because you're
in prison for murder.

18:32.334 --> 18:34.534
- Nah. That's not it.
- Yeah, that's not it.

18:34.569 --> 18:37.938
Before this, I used to date
all my brother's friends

18:37.939 --> 18:39.006
from the mob.

18:39.007 --> 18:40.941
All dogs too.

18:40.942 --> 18:42.742
Never mind. You don't want
to hear about them.

18:42.777 --> 18:45.045
No! I do want to hear
about them.

18:45.046 --> 18:48.181
Please.
Tell me everything about them.

18:48.216 --> 18:51.819
Thanks.
That would be nice.

18:51.820 --> 18:53.787
Ahh! Not a toucher.
Totally get it.

18:53.788 --> 18:55.456
I'll keep my hands to myself.

18:55.457 --> 18:57.924
What's going on, Sarge?
You find that leak yet?

18:57.959 --> 19:00.527
Yes. I'm hiding behind a
coffeemaker, spying on everyone

19:00.528 --> 19:02.428
in this office,
because I found the leak.

19:02.464 --> 19:05.399
Aww, Terry. Sarcasm is not
a good look on you.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.134
But you know what would be?

19:07.135 --> 19:10.204
- A really tight Henley.
- Very helpful.

19:10.205 --> 19:11.504
I know who your leak is.

19:11.539 --> 19:12.906
What?

19:12.907 --> 19:15.275
I looked up the reporter
who published the crime numbers,

19:15.276 --> 19:17.577
and I noticed you two
follow each other online.

19:17.612 --> 19:19.613
He followed me,
and you know I'm

19:19.614 --> 19:22.181
a proud member
of team follow-back.

19:22.217 --> 19:23.417
So I went through your feed

19:23.418 --> 19:24.718
to see what you were posting.

19:24.719 --> 19:27.487
Lot of pictures of your kids.
Nobody cares.

19:27.522 --> 19:30.557
And then I found this picture
you posted last week.

19:30.558 --> 19:33.527
"Living that #YOGURT life."

19:33.528 --> 19:35.294
Embarrassing.

19:35.330 --> 19:37.498
But what's even
more embarrassing, Terry,

19:37.499 --> 19:42.035
is that the arrest numbers
are in the photo, clear as day.

19:42.070 --> 19:43.871
Oh, my God!

19:43.872 --> 19:46.340
I was the leak!

19:46.341 --> 19:47.541
I got to take that picture down.

19:47.542 --> 19:50.477
Gina, I am so sorry
I blamed you.

19:50.478 --> 19:52.679
And I knew you would
say something like that,

19:52.680 --> 19:54.515
so I went ahead
and bought myself a cake

19:54.516 --> 19:55.816
on your behalf.

19:55.817 --> 19:57.884
Check it out.

19:57.919 --> 19:59.252
Oh, dang.

19:59.287 --> 20:01.822
And this has been here for
the last half-hour, detective.

20:01.823 --> 20:03.290
Didn't even notice it.

20:03.291 --> 20:06.093
God, I'm so sick of doing
everyone's job for them.

20:06.094 --> 20:08.094
It's like, help me out
a little bit.

20:08.129 --> 20:10.163
Just once in a blue moon.

20:10.198 --> 20:11.665
Well, we did it.

20:11.666 --> 20:12.866
For a second there,
I didn't think

20:12.867 --> 20:14.101
we were going to pull it off.

20:14.102 --> 20:16.636
- I knew we could.
- And we did. To us!

20:16.671 --> 20:18.171
Oh. What are
you guys celebrating?

20:18.206 --> 20:19.773
Terry was mad at us,
but we didn't know

20:19.774 --> 20:21.575
what he was talking about,
and he went away.

20:21.576 --> 20:23.744
- Huge day.
- Uh-huh.

20:23.745 --> 20:27.147
It's Amy.

20:27.148 --> 20:28.448
Hey, girlfriend.

20:28.483 --> 20:29.683
Jake, Maury told me

20:29.684 --> 20:31.717
who Figgis has working
for him in the FBI.

20:31.753 --> 20:32.986
Yeah,
I already know who it is,

20:32.987 --> 20:34.521
because I just caught him:

20:34.522 --> 20:36.123
Special Agent Ryan Whealon.

20:36.124 --> 20:38.258
Also, I did one full pull-up.

20:38.259 --> 20:39.927
I'm gonna be so buff
when you get back.

20:39.928 --> 20:41.894
Cool, babe.
Did you get the other guy?

20:41.930 --> 20:44.497
- What other guy?
- Someone named Bob Anderson.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.835
Bob?

20:47.836 --> 20:48.969
Oh, my God.

20:48.970 --> 20:51.371
Amy, I have to go.

20:51.372 --> 20:53.640
- Bob is working for Figgis.
- What?

20:53.641 --> 20:55.642
He must've been the one who
deleted all those digital files.

20:55.643 --> 20:57.010
And he tried to have
Whealon killed.

20:57.011 --> 20:58.245
But he helped us
with the heist,

20:58.246 --> 20:59.813
and there was nothing about him
in the paper file.

20:59.814 --> 21:01.849
Yeah, because that wasn't
the real file.

21:02.984 --> 21:06.053
I just need to put
my return address on it.

21:06.054 --> 21:08.722
And... there you go.

21:08.723 --> 21:10.390
Oh, thank you.

21:10.391 --> 21:11.891
We have to call Holt.

21:14.395 --> 21:17.064
Come on, Captain.
Pick up. Pick up.

21:20.268 --> 21:22.736
Don't answer that, Raymond.

21:22.737 --> 21:25.405
And now I'm going
to have to kill you.

21:25.406 --> 21:27.649
Oh, Bob.
