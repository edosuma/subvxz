(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:42.160 --> 00:44.600
In the course of making Blue Planet II,

00:44.680 --> 00:48.400
we've explored every corner
of the underwater world.

00:50.640 --> 00:53.600
We've encountered extraordinary animals,

01:00.000 --> 01:05.160
and discovered new insights into
how life is lived beneath the waves.

01:11.280 --> 01:15.400
For years we thought
that the oceans were so vast

01:15.480 --> 01:18.800
and the inhabitants
so infinitely numerous

01:18.880 --> 01:22.400
that nothing we could do
could have an effect upon them.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.560
But now we know that was wrong.

01:25.400 --> 01:30.800
The oceans are under threat now
as never before in human history.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.320
In this final episode,

01:34.400 --> 01:39.520
we will meet the pioneers
who are striving to turn things around.

01:39.960 --> 01:41.920
(GULLS SQUAWKING)

01:44.280 --> 01:49.160
People who are helping to save
the ocean's most vulnerable inhabitants

01:51.520 --> 01:55.760
and dedicating their lives
to protecting the seas.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.840
But is time running out?

02:02.920 --> 02:07.400
Many people believe that our oceans
have reached a crisis point.

02:07.920 --> 02:11.720
So just how fragile is our blue planet?

02:27.360 --> 02:30.320
Winter in the Arctic Circle.

02:32.600 --> 02:36.000
Every year, the waters of Norway
are the setting

02:36.080 --> 02:39.560
for one of the greatest
wildlife spectacles in the ocean.

02:40.960 --> 02:45.320
Over a billion herring
pour into these fields.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.320
The Blue Planet II team
spent three years

02:50.400 --> 02:52.920
documenting this astonishing event.

02:57.360 --> 03:00.760
Such a wealth of prey attracts predators

03:00.840 --> 03:02.880
in extraordinary numbers.

03:03.440 --> 03:04.800
(ORCA WHISTLES)

03:06.160 --> 03:07.600
Orcas

03:12.600 --> 03:14.520
and humpback whales.

03:35.120 --> 03:39.520
But this migration
hasn't always been so bountiful.

03:40.440 --> 03:44.400
Leif Notastad is a Norwegian
fisheries scientist.

03:45.240 --> 03:48.000
It's been one of
the most important fisheries

03:48.120 --> 03:51.800
that we had for centuries
along the whole coast of Norway.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.880
But in the late 1960s

03:53.960 --> 03:57.760
the herrings that we see around us here
was on the brink of collapse.

04:02.560 --> 04:05.560
50 years ago,
fishing was so intensive

04:05.640 --> 04:08.320
that the herring had all
but disappeared.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.920
Orcas were seen as rivals

04:13.000 --> 04:15.120
and hundreds of them were killed.

04:22.040 --> 04:26.400
It was only after the Norwegian
government imposed severe restrictions

04:26.480 --> 04:28.680
that the herring began to recover.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.760
(GULLS SQUAWKING)

04:35.200 --> 04:39.960
Today, this is once again
an immensely productive fishery,

04:40.840 --> 04:44.240
closely monitored
by teams of scientists.

04:47.960 --> 04:50.280
Marine biologist Eve Jourdain

04:50.360 --> 04:53.360
is one of the resident orca experts.

04:53.920 --> 04:56.920
From 1982, orcas got protected in Norway

04:57.000 --> 05:01.640
and we have clearly one of the largest
orca population in the world out here.

05:04.040 --> 05:06.880
There are now over
a thousand orcas here.

05:07.080 --> 05:10.560
But with so many mouths to feed,
including ours,

05:10.640 --> 05:13.240
can the mistakes of the past be avoided?

05:15.520 --> 05:17.720
To answer this vital question,

05:17.800 --> 05:21.840
Eve and her team are using
multi sensor camera tags.

05:24.080 --> 05:29.720
With the tags we try to see
how the orcas interact with their prey.

05:29.800 --> 05:33.320
How they hunt and all about
the underwater behaviour

05:33.400 --> 05:35.680
that we are not able to see
from the boat.

05:37.960 --> 05:40.160
A tag has to be attached

05:40.240 --> 05:42.480
to the orca in
exactly the right position.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.720
MAN: Here it goes. Here it comes.

05:52.160 --> 05:53.840
EVE: Oh, that's a good shot.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.560
(LAUGHS)

05:58.160 --> 06:01.120
It is the least invasive method.
It is suction cups.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.720
So it is not a scratch
on the whale afterwards

06:03.800 --> 06:05.520
which is something we really like.

06:08.880 --> 06:10.720
While studying the orcas,

06:10.800 --> 06:14.320
Eve noticed a worrying change
in their behaviour.

06:15.240 --> 06:18.440
They had worked out
the easiest way to get a meal.

06:19.840 --> 06:22.080
EVE: We have seen that
the orcas are waiting

06:22.160 --> 06:24.640
for those fishing boats to drop the net.

06:26.080 --> 06:27.960
It acts like a dinner bell

06:28.040 --> 06:30.880
and then all the orcas
of the area gather.

06:31.840 --> 06:33.600
Quite a lot of herring slip from the net

06:33.680 --> 06:36.320
and this is exactly what
the orcas are looking for.

06:39.760 --> 06:44.000
But this new tactic
is dangerous, as Eve has witnessed.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.280
We were there to monitor
the behaviour of the orcas

06:48.360 --> 06:50.520
scavenging around the nets.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.600
And we realised that
one large adult male

06:53.680 --> 06:55.720
was actually trapped inside the net.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.080
When the fishermen
started to retrieve the net

06:59.160 --> 07:01.760
the orca was obviously starting to panic

07:01.840 --> 07:05.000
and trying to pull as much as he could.

07:05.080 --> 07:07.520
This orca was really fighting
for his life.

07:09.680 --> 07:12.000
Stringent rules require fishermen

07:12.080 --> 07:14.840
to get permission
before they open their nets.

07:16.680 --> 07:18.200
But that took time.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.000
EVE: It was such a long process.

07:25.720 --> 07:29.840
We thought that the whale
was going to die of exhaustion.

07:33.640 --> 07:36.400
Thankfully, the fishermen
finally got the clearance

07:36.480 --> 07:39.960
to release their net
freeing the exhausted orca.

07:51.280 --> 07:55.960
It was a huge relief to see that
this orca made it until the end

07:56.040 --> 07:58.600
and finally got back to his family.

08:01.800 --> 08:05.600
With marine mammals
and humans competing so directly

08:05.680 --> 08:07.920
accidents are inevitable.

08:12.320 --> 08:14.800
Two days after tagging an orca,

08:14.880 --> 08:17.720
it's released and Eve collects it.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.280
This tag is full of secrets, you know,

08:23.360 --> 08:25.560
because it has been on
the whale for several days

08:25.640 --> 08:28.800
and will just reveal exactly
what the whales have been doing.

08:29.440 --> 08:33.760
Pictures from the tag
reveal the hunting technique in detail.

08:40.240 --> 08:43.160
They dive below the ball of fish

08:46.000 --> 08:47.800
and then back flip.

08:51.120 --> 08:55.040
The tail slap stuns the herring.

08:57.520 --> 09:01.600
Eve can even work out
how many fish the orcas are taking.

09:02.400 --> 09:06.360
EVE: They can kill up to 30 herring
with just one tail slap.

09:06.440 --> 09:08.320
And then what is pretty amazing is

09:08.400 --> 09:11.440
all the individuals of the group
share the dead herring.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.760
And it's not just
the orcas feeding here...

09:17.920 --> 09:21.440
Humpback whales
are also drawn to the feast.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.320
They too are being tagged and monitored

09:37.400 --> 09:39.360
giving fishery scientist Leif

09:39.440 --> 09:42.880
a complete picture of
how much herring is being eaten.

09:43.840 --> 09:47.680
The whales, they take
probably less than 1%.

09:48.680 --> 09:51.920
The fishermen take less than 10%.

09:52.640 --> 09:56.440
So the balance there is that
there is enough for everybody.

09:56.520 --> 09:59.400
Given that we manage to stock
in sustainable

09:59.480 --> 10:01.320
and a long term sustainable way.

10:10.480 --> 10:14.960
But it's estimated that
almost a third of ocean fisheries

10:15.040 --> 10:17.160
are being over exploited.

10:21.480 --> 10:24.240
The remarkable recovery
of the herring here

10:24.320 --> 10:28.160
demonstrates what can happen
if a fishery is carefully managed.

10:46.080 --> 10:49.200
Our maltreatment of the seas
has many effects.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.640
Some are predictable,

10:53.680 --> 10:57.360
but there are others
that are rather more surprising.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.720
Southeast Asia.

11:09.960 --> 11:13.960
The coral reefs here are among
the richest on the planet.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.680
Marine biologist Steve Simpson,

11:26.760 --> 11:29.680
is discovering how important sound is

11:29.760 --> 11:33.200
to the animals that live in these
bustling coral cities.

11:34.920 --> 11:37.400
STEVE: We're only now just realising
by listening underwater

11:37.480 --> 11:39.440
that the fish are making
all these sounds.

11:39.720 --> 11:42.360
They use sound to attract a mate.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.600
To try and scare away a predator.

11:45.720 --> 11:49.560
You hear pops and grunts
and gurgles and snaps.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.960
There's a whole language underwater

11:54.040 --> 11:56.440
that we're only just starting
to get a handle on.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.040
(MOANING)

12:02.920 --> 12:04.640
(CHIRPING)

12:15.880 --> 12:19.880
Using an advanced
multi directional hydrophone,

12:19.960 --> 12:23.800
Steve is trying to make sense
of this extraordinary chorus

12:23.880 --> 12:27.600
by working out who is making
which noise.

12:30.520 --> 12:33.480
One fish is especially talkative.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.280
(POPPING SOUND)

12:36.360 --> 12:39.440
It's perhaps the reef's
most famous resident.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.040
The clownfish.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.520
While filming for the series,

12:46.600 --> 12:50.840
we followed this particular family
of saddleback clownfish

12:50.920 --> 12:54.160
as they search for a suitable place
to lay their eggs.

12:57.640 --> 13:00.000
It's a noisy affair.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.200
(POPPING SOUND)

13:14.800 --> 13:17.040
STEVE: For clownfish sound
really is everything.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.600
They spend all day
talking to each other.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.160
You've got dominance and submission.

13:22.240 --> 13:24.400
You've got all the others
calling to each other.

13:26.120 --> 13:29.080
It seems that they also use sound

13:30.240 --> 13:35.000
in protecting themselves from the many
predators that hunt around the reef.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.520
Including coral trout.

13:57.360 --> 14:01.080
Will this model trout
fool the clownfish?

14:07.480 --> 14:10.040
They react almost immediately.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.520
(THUMPING SOUNDS)

14:12.600 --> 14:14.080
By mimicking a predator,

14:14.160 --> 14:19.200
Steve manages to record their alarm
calls without putting them at risk.

14:20.160 --> 14:23.480
STEVE: You can really hear the deeper
pulsing sound of the female

14:23.560 --> 14:26.000
as she tries to scare
the coral trout away.

14:27.760 --> 14:30.120
And all the little ones are
just popping... Pop, pop, pop.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.480
As if to say, "I'm still okay.
I'm still alive."

14:32.560 --> 14:34.240
(THUMPING SOUNDS)

14:34.320 --> 14:37.520
So they've got this real language
of sounds that they're using

14:37.600 --> 14:40.760
just to try and defend the colony
against this coral trout.

14:44.120 --> 14:47.760
But that discovery
has led to a serious worry.

14:48.440 --> 14:50.200
(MOTOR HUMMING)

14:50.880 --> 14:54.040
STEVE: The fish were really
popping away at the predator.

14:54.120 --> 14:57.720
But as soon as the boat came over
they looked completely distracted.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.800
With all that noise it completely
changed how the fish were behaving.

15:02.480 --> 15:05.680
Unable to make themselves
heard above the noise of boats,

15:05.760 --> 15:08.400
the family can't warn each other
of danger.

15:08.480 --> 15:11.320
And so they are now
vulnerable to attack.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.600
You think about how many boats
are driving around.

15:14.680 --> 15:17.560
All of the ships,
all of the offshore drilling.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.400
All the noise that we're making
in the ocean

15:19.480 --> 15:21.400
you realise just how much
we're drowning out

15:21.480 --> 15:23.400
this natural biological noise,

15:23.480 --> 15:27.440
robbing animals of their ability to be
able to talk to each other.

15:31.240 --> 15:35.840
All this noise may have
serious consequences for many reef fish

15:35.920 --> 15:40.080
because their babies, as soon as they
hatch are swept out to sea.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.760
There they feed and grow
until strong enough to swim back.

15:49.720 --> 15:53.640
And to find the reef, they use sound.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.680
STEVE: They listen in. They eavesdrop
to the noises that they can hear

15:57.760 --> 16:00.960
and they use that to choose which reef
they want to make their home.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.720
But obviously because we're adding
all this noise to the ocean

16:03.800 --> 16:06.200
it's a wonder whether they can even
hear the reef at all.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.480
(HORN BLOWING)

16:11.400 --> 16:15.000
Man-made noise is now
everywhere in the ocean.

16:15.120 --> 16:18.760
And it has an effect on
marine creatures of all kinds.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.840
From tiny fish

16:24.480 --> 16:26.840
to gigantic whales.

16:30.040 --> 16:33.160
But Steve believes there are solutions.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.360
STEVE: Noise in the ocean
is a real problem.

16:36.440 --> 16:38.560
But, it's something that we can control.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.160
We can choose where we make the noise.

16:40.240 --> 16:42.160
We can choose when we make the noise.

16:42.240 --> 16:45.600
We can directly reduce
the amount of noise that we make

16:45.680 --> 16:47.480
and we can start doing that today.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.240
(MOTOR HUMMING)

16:55.480 --> 16:57.720
We're only now beginning to realise

16:57.800 --> 17:01.880
what an impact our noise is having
on the inhabitants of the ocean.

17:04.880 --> 17:08.040
Other forms of pollution
are only too familiar.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.720
Since its invention some
hundred years ago,

17:17.800 --> 17:21.680
plastic has become an integral part
of our daily lives.

17:21.760 --> 17:25.400
But every year,
some eight million tonnes of it

17:25.480 --> 17:27.360
ends up in the ocean.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.680
And there, it could be lethal.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.240
While filming Blue Planet II,

17:37.320 --> 17:40.720
the crews found plastic in every ocean.

17:42.200 --> 17:45.400
Even in the most remote locations.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.880
900 miles north of Antarctica,

17:55.960 --> 17:59.160
this isolated wilderness
is the breeding place

17:59.240 --> 18:02.840
for vast numbers of penguins
and elephant seals.

Here we learn of
the extraordinary lengths

ancient parents go to give their chicks
the best chance of survival.

18:35.080 --> 18:39.800

of miles searching for fish and squid

18:39.880 --> 18:41.800

18:56.480 --> 18:59.960
studying the birds here
for the last 40 years.

19:01.120 --> 19:03.240
LUCY: Its only through looking at
long terms studies

19:03.320 --> 19:05.760
that you get a sense of these creatures.

19:05.840 --> 19:10.960
And the albatrosses here have,
over the past 10 years, been in decline.

19:12.440 --> 19:15.480
There are a number of
possible reasons.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.320
While foraging at sea,

19:17.400 --> 19:21.360
albatross can get entangled
and drowned by fishing gear.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.840
But Lucy is particularly alarmed

19:25.920 --> 19:28.960
by what the parents are bringing back
for their chick.

19:29.240 --> 19:31.840
LUCY: Albatrosses have
the ability to cough up

19:31.920 --> 19:34.240
bits of food that they can't digest.

19:34.320 --> 19:37.160
And from that we can tell
what they've been eating.

19:38.080 --> 19:42.240
A healthy albatross chick in its diet
should really have things like squid.

19:42.320 --> 19:46.080
So we can find the squid beaks
that come out of the pellet.

19:46.160 --> 19:49.720
And also things like fish
so we can find fish bones as well.

19:51.960 --> 19:56.520
But these chicks are being
fed something very different.

19:57.320 --> 20:02.360
We have some plastic that
this poor chick has had to bring up.

20:03.600 --> 20:04.960
Plastic bag.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.160
Here we have some food packaging.
Looks like rice.

20:11.960 --> 20:16.160
Luckily for this chick, he has managed
to get this out of his stomach.

20:16.240 --> 20:19.360
So, fingers crossed he doesn't have
any more plastic left in there

20:19.440 --> 20:20.640
before he fledges.

20:24.040 --> 20:27.720
For other chicks, plastic can be fatal.

20:29.640 --> 20:32.360
LUCY: Unfortunately,
there is a plastic toothpick

20:32.440 --> 20:34.560
that have actually gone through
the stomach.

20:34.640 --> 20:39.000
Something just as small as that has
actually has managed to kill the bird.

20:39.080 --> 20:40.680
It's really sad to see.

20:43.120 --> 20:48.200
Lucy collects and records
what plastic she finds around the nests.

20:51.280 --> 20:56.280
LUCY: These are items that were
regurgitated just from last season.

20:56.360 --> 20:59.320
And that's gonna be
a vast underestimation

20:59.400 --> 21:02.240
because that's just ones
that we happen to find.

21:02.320 --> 21:06.000
There'll be many more that
we never see being brought back.

21:09.160 --> 21:12.080
To find out where
all this rubbish is coming from,

21:12.160 --> 21:17.640
Lucy and her team have attached
GPS trackers to adult birds.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.800
LUCY: It's showing where they're
going to find food for themselves

21:25.880 --> 21:28.440
and to find food to bring back
for their chicks.

21:29.400 --> 21:32.240
It really shows us that
they could be picking up plastic

21:32.320 --> 21:34.720
from thousands of miles away.

21:35.480 --> 21:38.280
Plastics coming from either being
dumped at sea

21:38.360 --> 21:40.960
or also from people's homes.

21:41.040 --> 21:44.760
Plastic gets into the rivers and then
the rivers flow into the sea.

21:45.360 --> 21:48.920
So this isn't just a problem
around these remote parts.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
This is happening worldwide.

21:51.080 --> 21:53.760
And it's our rubbish
that's going into the oceans.

21:53.840 --> 21:56.320
It's our problem that we need to solve.

22:01.040 --> 22:02.920
In some parts of the ocean,

22:03.000 --> 22:08.080
it's estimated that there are now over
one million pieces of plastic

22:08.160 --> 22:09.840
for every square mile.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.920
And we're only beginning to discover

22:13.000 --> 22:16.440
just how seriously
that affects marine life.

22:24.040 --> 22:26.800
On the east coast of the United States,

22:26.880 --> 22:31.960
researchers are investigating
the mysterious deaths of young dolphins.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.480
The team is led by Dr Leslie Hart.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.840
It looks to be a young animal.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.680
Maybe a little bit over a year.

22:49.760 --> 22:53.080
So we're gonna try to find out more
information on why this dolphin died.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.840
Looking at young dolphins...

23:03.920 --> 23:06.640
The very young dolphins,
it's always heart-breaking.

23:14.360 --> 23:17.080
Leslie takes tissue samples.

23:17.760 --> 23:21.360
Their chemical analysis
could provide crucial evidence.

23:22.400 --> 23:26.520
LUCY: We are often shocked
by the high levels of toxins

23:26.600 --> 23:28.400
that we detect in these animals.

23:29.920 --> 23:33.200
These young calves are dying
for a number of reasons.

23:33.280 --> 23:37.280
But we suspect man-made toxins
are playing a large role.

23:39.840 --> 23:42.600
And plastic could be
part of the problem.

23:52.720 --> 23:54.280
Once in the ocean,

23:54.360 --> 23:57.440
plastic breaks down into tiny fragments.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.160
Micro plastics.

24:03.400 --> 24:07.440
Along with all the industrial chemicals
that have drained into the ocean

24:07.520 --> 24:10.600
these form a potentially toxic soup.

24:16.840 --> 24:18.760
LESLIE: The really small organisms

24:18.840 --> 24:22.240
can mistake these tiny,
tiny plastics as food.

24:22.320 --> 24:25.000
Then the larger organisms
eat the plankton.

24:25.080 --> 24:27.640
Then the larger fish
eat the smaller fish,

24:27.720 --> 24:29.160
and so on and so forth.

24:31.200 --> 24:34.400
Dolphins are
at the top of this food chain

24:34.480 --> 24:38.040
and it's now thought that pollutants
may be building up in their tissues

24:38.120 --> 24:43.760
to such a degree that a mother's
contaminated milk could kill her calf.

25:01.840 --> 25:06.200
Industrial pollution
and the discarding of plastic waste

25:06.280 --> 25:10.600
must be tackled for the sake of
all life in the ocean.

25:26.440 --> 25:30.120
Around the world,
people are now devoting their lives

25:30.200 --> 25:33.400
to saving some of the most
threatened sea creatures.

25:35.480 --> 25:38.080
As here in the Caribbean.

25:41.760 --> 25:44.640
Every year on just a few islands,

25:44.720 --> 25:47.360
a remarkable event takes place.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.680
As the sun sets,

25:59.760 --> 26:02.760
giant reptiles begin to emerge.

26:06.480 --> 26:07.600
(GRUNTS)

26:17.040 --> 26:20.640
This magnificent creature preparing...

26:20.720 --> 26:22.680
Whoops. (LAUGHS)

26:22.760 --> 26:25.200
Preparing to lay her eggs

26:25.280 --> 26:28.160
is the largest of all turtles.

26:28.240 --> 26:29.600
A leatherback.

26:30.520 --> 26:34.320
They can grow up to
half a tonne in weight.

26:34.400 --> 26:38.240
And they have an ancestry that
goes back a hundred million years

26:38.320 --> 26:40.320
to the age of the dinosaur.

26:41.560 --> 26:46.680
But in recent times their numbers
have fallen catastrophically.

26:47.680 --> 26:51.840
Here, however, in the Caribbean
there is hope.

26:53.960 --> 26:54.960
(GRUNTS)

26:56.480 --> 26:58.880
Leatherback turtles leave the sea

26:58.960 --> 27:02.120
in order to lay their eggs
in the dry sand.

27:04.520 --> 27:09.480
But out of water, these huge creatures
are easy targets for hunters.

27:13.200 --> 27:16.000
In a small fishing village in Trinidad,

27:16.080 --> 27:19.920
Len Peters has experienced this
first hand.

27:21.200 --> 27:25.600
I grew up in a household where
the presence of turtle meat was normal.

27:25.680 --> 27:27.480
The fridge was always full of it.

27:27.560 --> 27:30.600
Everybody... Everybody harvested
turtles, including my parents.

27:31.560 --> 27:34.040
It's only when I became
exposed to things

27:34.120 --> 27:35.920
that were being published
about leatherbacks

27:36.000 --> 27:37.440
who were on the verge of extinction.

27:37.520 --> 27:39.080
And nobody cares.

27:39.160 --> 27:40.640
That piqued my interest.

27:41.680 --> 27:45.720
Len took the leatherback's
future into his own hands.

27:47.600 --> 27:51.440
He began patrolling the beach at night
to protect the turtles.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.640
A brave thing to do.

27:57.360 --> 28:00.160
LEN: We were met with
tremendous resistance.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.000
People would pelt us at night.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.240
I have had persons insult me.

28:04.320 --> 28:05.880
I've had persons curse me.

28:05.960 --> 28:10.680
I've had persons physically
try to wrestle me with a machete.

28:10.760 --> 28:13.400
So it was really
a hostile time back then.

28:13.480 --> 28:16.200
If Len was going to
save these turtles

28:16.280 --> 28:19.040
he needed to win over
the whole community.

28:21.240 --> 28:25.480
LEN: We had to find a way to
get the villagers to benefit

28:25.560 --> 28:27.600
from the presence of these animals.

28:30.720 --> 28:34.440
He began to encourage
tourists to visit the beach

28:34.520 --> 28:37.440
and trained some villagers
to be their guides.

28:41.560 --> 28:44.120
To help secure the turtles' future,

28:44.200 --> 28:47.280
he took the message
to the next generation.

28:47.840 --> 28:51.840
Now what's... What's the largest size
a leatherback can grow to?

28:52.200 --> 28:54.280
Uh, Shanie.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.440
-2,000 pounds.
-That's correct.

28:56.520 --> 29:00.280
Leatherbacks can grow to 2,000 pounds.

29:00.360 --> 29:01.920
Well, that's a big turtle.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.600
Len's hard work paid off.

29:04.680 --> 29:07.000
And now, attitudes have changed.

29:07.080 --> 29:09.080
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

29:10.760 --> 29:14.280
LEN: It took us a while to
reach out to the villagers.

29:14.360 --> 29:16.800
But gradually we got them
involved as well.

29:16.880 --> 29:19.840
We got some of the poachers who
would be hunting the animals to

29:20.040 --> 29:21.800
be part of the conservation programme.

29:24.440 --> 29:26.920
As well as protecting
the adult turtles,

29:27.000 --> 29:31.280
the team also collect any eggs
that might be flooded at high tide.

29:34.320 --> 29:37.160
LEN: If the eggs are laid
too close to the sea,

29:37.240 --> 29:39.840
we relocate the eggs and rebury them.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.800
Thanks to the efforts of this community,

29:43.880 --> 29:47.400
these turtles have had an extraordinary
change in fortune.

29:49.600 --> 29:52.120
This is now thought to be
one of the densest

29:52.200 --> 29:55.000
leatherback nesting beaches
in the world.

29:58.880 --> 30:02.400
LEN: When we started at the height
of the nesting season,

30:02.480 --> 30:06.160
the numbers will be 30-40 turtles
a night.

30:06.240 --> 30:07.960
Now, it's over 500.

30:08.080 --> 30:11.360
So, we have seen an increase
from 40 turtles

30:11.440 --> 30:14.400
to 500 turtles a night
in just around 20 years.

30:18.040 --> 30:21.800
Precious new hatchlings
are also given a helping hand.

30:25.360 --> 30:28.440
Any that emerge during the day
are collected

30:28.520 --> 30:33.240
to be released safely back to the sea,
away from hungry birds.

30:40.400 --> 30:45.040
This little leatherback will have to
face a thousand hazards

30:45.120 --> 30:49.480
before it returns as an adult
to this beach where it hatched.

30:50.360 --> 30:53.560
And those dangers will be
greatly increased

30:53.640 --> 30:56.840
because of damage that we have done
to the ocean.

30:58.760 --> 31:00.200
Good luck, little leatherback.

31:31.680 --> 31:34.040
Protecting breeding sites on beaches

31:34.120 --> 31:38.560
may improve the fortune
of some marine animals,

31:38.640 --> 31:42.800
but safeguarding them while they roam
the high seas is much more difficult.

31:47.800 --> 31:50.720
Out here, there is little protection.

31:59.560 --> 32:05.600
Every night, thousands of miles of
fishing lines laden with hooks are set.

32:07.960 --> 32:11.280
There's enough, it's said,
to wrap twice around the world.

32:16.240 --> 32:19.520
Nets large enough to engulf cathedrals

32:19.600 --> 32:22.840
trap hundreds of tonnes of fish
at a time.

32:25.520 --> 32:30.000
Long distance travellers such as sharks
are particularly at risk.

32:36.280 --> 32:40.560
It's estimated that tens of millions
are killed every year,

32:40.640 --> 32:45.440
including the biggest fish in the sea,
the whale shark.

32:57.480 --> 33:01.160
Shark biologist Jonathan Green
is concerned

33:01.240 --> 33:04.640
that time is running out
for these extraordinary creatures.

33:05.840 --> 33:08.560
We know that they're being fished
possibly at a massive rate.

33:09.040 --> 33:12.480
They may be taken by the thousands,
possibly tens of thousands a year.

33:13.160 --> 33:14.880
If that is indeed true,

33:14.960 --> 33:18.440
we don't know how long they can
withstand that kind of fishing pressure.

33:20.240 --> 33:23.160
To save them,
Jonathan is trying to solve

33:23.240 --> 33:25.880
the mystery of where they give birth.

33:31.960 --> 33:36.320
And, for the first time, he has a clue
as to where this might be.

33:43.600 --> 33:47.680
Pregnant whale sharks are thought to be
travelling from across the Pacific Ocean

33:47.760 --> 33:50.480
to Darwin Island in the Galapagos.

33:59.160 --> 34:01.360
Jonathan is going to try and attach

34:01.440 --> 34:04.920
a multi-sensor camera tag
to a pregnant female.

34:05.880 --> 34:07.280
Okay. We're good to go.

34:15.840 --> 34:19.000
These sharks only stay in the area
for a few days.

34:19.960 --> 34:21.880
This may be his only chance.

34:34.160 --> 34:39.520
Jonathan has to attach the tag before
the shark dives to dangerous depths.

34:58.680 --> 35:02.000
The tag will remain on the giant's fin
for two days

35:02.080 --> 35:04.160
before it's automatically released.

35:06.840 --> 35:10.760
Once retrieved, it reveals
some unusual behaviour.

35:13.440 --> 35:14.920
Oh, beautiful, beautiful.

35:17.480 --> 35:21.840
There's a silky rubbing up against
the front. Next to her right.

35:22.240 --> 35:25.960
The silky sharks are
brushing up against her rough skin,

35:26.040 --> 35:28.320
perhaps to scrape off parasites.

35:30.160 --> 35:34.920
These predatory sharks make the surface
waters very unsafe places

35:35.000 --> 35:37.200
for young fish of any kind.

35:40.080 --> 35:42.280
There is a surprise in store.

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
The tag's depth sensor reveals
that she dived

35:47.080 --> 35:49.720
to a depth of 600 metres.

35:51.880 --> 35:55.320
But down there,
it's too dark for the camera.

36:01.560 --> 36:04.800
The only way Jonathan can prove
if they're giving birth

36:05.680 --> 36:07.480
is to go down and look.

36:07.960 --> 36:09.840
(RADIO CHATTER)

36:19.560 --> 36:23.440
(RADIO CHATTER)

36:31.000 --> 36:34.800
Out of the gloom, a shape materialises.

36:37.360 --> 36:39.440
Another massive whale shark.

36:41.320 --> 36:44.480
Oh, look at her. She's having a look
at us. She's looking right at us.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.640
She is huge.

36:51.760 --> 36:54.160
And look at the belly.
Absolutely massive.

36:55.440 --> 36:57.200
That's a large pregnant female.

36:58.160 --> 37:00.120
She's turning around.
She's turning around.

37:06.200 --> 37:08.960
Goes to show we can follow them.
We can follow them in the submarine.

37:12.840 --> 37:15.880
She leads them down
into the darkness.

37:18.720 --> 37:22.720
MAN (OVER RADIO): Rover control.
Passing 100 metres, descending.

37:25.200 --> 37:28.800
Heading down.
I think she's accelerated slightly.

37:32.520 --> 37:34.320
She's too fast.

37:35.360 --> 37:39.320
And with the strong current running
against them, the sub can't keep up.

37:44.040 --> 37:47.680
But, for the first time,
Jonathan can see for himself

37:47.760 --> 37:49.600
exactly where she's headed.

37:52.240 --> 37:54.320
What specifically Darwin
could provide

37:54.400 --> 37:59.160
is a safe refuge for those new-born pups
where predators can't access.

38:00.920 --> 38:03.560
Perfect conditions
for the formative years

38:03.640 --> 38:05.480
of these ocean-travelling giants.

38:13.360 --> 38:14.960
That was unbelievable.

38:16.600 --> 38:18.360
(SIGHS) Dream of a lifetime.

38:21.080 --> 38:23.240
His discovery
that pregnant whale sharks

38:23.320 --> 38:26.280
are visiting this very deep patch
of the sea floor

38:26.360 --> 38:30.520
is strong evidence that this is indeed
where the giants produce their young.

38:33.280 --> 38:36.680
If I can actually prove
that they are giving birth in this area,

38:36.760 --> 38:38.840
then we'll have
the information necessary

38:38.920 --> 38:40.920
to go to governments and actually say,

38:41.000 --> 38:44.200
"You must preserve those routes
that they're migrating through."

38:44.280 --> 38:47.640
And then, and only then,
can we really truly afford protection

38:47.720 --> 38:49.800
for this beautiful ocean traveller.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.840
Today, less than one percent

38:59.920 --> 39:02.600
of our international waters
are protected.

39:05.480 --> 39:08.880
And the creation of marine reserves
is vital

39:08.960 --> 39:12.920
if we're to safeguard the future
of many ocean creatures.

39:18.800 --> 39:21.440
It will require
international cooperation.

39:22.880 --> 39:24.800
But here, too, there is hope.

39:27.120 --> 39:29.280
We can turn things around.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.960
We've done so once before.

39:32.880 --> 39:36.640
For centuries,
the sea-going nations of the world

39:36.720 --> 39:39.680
hunted the great whales
until they were close to extinction.

39:40.560 --> 39:44.840
And then, in 1986,
those nations got together

39:44.920 --> 39:48.800
and agreed to put a stop
to commercial whaling.

39:52.560 --> 39:56.320
Today, although a few nations
continue to hunt whales,

39:56.400 --> 39:59.160
some of the great whales
are making a recovery.

40:07.520 --> 40:10.280
In the tropical seas
surrounding Sri Lanka,

40:10.360 --> 40:13.840
there are stories of vast gatherings
of whales.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.480
When the civil war ended in 2009,

40:21.560 --> 40:25.440
locals here were able once again
to fish these waters.

40:28.200 --> 40:31.720
There were soon reports of assemblies
of sperm whales,

40:31.800 --> 40:34.960
the likes of which had not been seen
for centuries.

40:37.160 --> 40:41.120
Marine guide Daya was determined
to get to the truth

40:41.200 --> 40:43.520
behind these fishermen's tales.

40:44.480 --> 40:46.720
DAYA: The fishermen told me that
there are lots of whales

40:46.800 --> 40:48.000
a little bit north from here.

40:48.920 --> 40:51.320
They didn't actually tell me a number,

40:51.400 --> 40:54.760
but in big numbers, not one or twos.

40:54.840 --> 40:56.800
Er, many.

41:01.280 --> 41:03.600
It took him three years,

41:03.680 --> 41:08.240
but eventually, he found evidence
to support these rumours.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.920
(SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)

41:16.840 --> 41:18.880
(SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)

41:54.720 --> 41:58.000
DAYA: We saw about 15 sperm whales
go past us.

42:07.760 --> 42:09.800
Then, another four came past us.

42:13.160 --> 42:16.600
After about 40 then passed me,
I started counting.

42:21.640 --> 42:24.080
Still, they kept coming,
so I lost count.

42:26.440 --> 42:29.480
I estimated that we saw about
300 sperm whales.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.960
Sperm whales were once
killed in vast numbers

42:41.080 --> 42:43.880
and it's thought that if the slaughter
had continued,

42:43.960 --> 42:47.360
the species would be in danger
of extermination.

42:50.640 --> 42:55.360
But now, here at least,
they are being seen in huge numbers.

42:56.840 --> 43:00.680
DAYA: I believe they come here to feed,
mate, and raise their young.

43:00.800 --> 43:03.320
So, this must be a holiday spot
for them, you know.

43:03.640 --> 43:06.960
At the moment, I don't know
of any other place in the world

43:07.040 --> 43:09.760
that, er, sperm whales gather like this.

43:13.160 --> 43:16.800
Although some whale
populations are still in decline,

43:16.880 --> 43:21.600
scenes like this prove that when
sea-going nations come together,

43:21.680 --> 43:24.720
they can achieve astonishing results.

43:32.600 --> 43:38.080
But today, the oceans face threats
on a truly global scale.

43:43.840 --> 43:45.800
The Great Barrier Reef.

43:48.240 --> 43:51.680
The largest coral reef system
in the world.

43:54.360 --> 43:59.640
Here, we filmed stories which reveal
just how smart fish can be.

44:05.320 --> 44:08.080
This ingenious tuskfish, for example,

44:08.160 --> 44:12.560
used a favourite coral anvil
to smash open shellfish.

44:14.840 --> 44:18.320
This astonishing behaviour
has been closely studied

44:18.400 --> 44:20.840
by local scientist Alex Vail.

44:22.600 --> 44:25.080
We're calling Percy
"Percy the Persistent"

44:26.400 --> 44:29.600
because he took, like, an hour
to open the first shell.

44:35.040 --> 44:37.440
He must have hit it well over 50 times,

44:37.520 --> 44:40.400
but he just kept on going
and finally got it open.

44:49.840 --> 44:52.880
Alex grew up
on the Great Barrier Reef

44:52.960 --> 44:55.760
on one of its more remote islands,
Lizard.

44:58.120 --> 45:00.400
He knows the reef intimately.

45:05.720 --> 45:09.480
But, in 2016, while he was filming
for Blue Planet II,

45:09.560 --> 45:12.080
Alex witnessed a catastrophe.

45:14.040 --> 45:16.920
ALEX: When we started filming,
everything was pretty much fine.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.080
All of the corals
were basically healthy.

45:21.200 --> 45:24.480
But in the last few weeks,
everything changed.

45:25.520 --> 45:28.240
I have never seen anything
like this before.

45:31.440 --> 45:33.600
A combination of a warming ocean

45:33.680 --> 45:37.280
and an unpredictable weather event
called El Niño

45:37.360 --> 45:40.000
raised sea temperatures
to record levels.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.280
And this had a disastrous effect
on the corals.

45:49.800 --> 45:54.040
The heat causes reef-building corals
to lose their nourishing algae,

45:55.040 --> 45:57.560
exposing their white skeletons.

46:02.440 --> 46:06.560
When temperatures remain high,
bleached corals die off.

46:09.440 --> 46:12.400
The bleaching this year has been
the worst in history

46:12.480 --> 46:13.920
for the Great Barrier Reef.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.440
About 90 percent of the branching corals

46:16.520 --> 46:18.880
on the reef out here at Lizard Island
are dead.

46:21.840 --> 46:24.520
It also has disastrous consequences

46:24.600 --> 46:26.760
for the other creatures that live here.

46:30.320 --> 46:33.000
ALEX: Percy swimming around out there.

46:33.120 --> 46:36.080
The really sad thing is that his
castle's starting to bleach.

46:37.360 --> 46:40.600
If we lose our coral, there's a chance
we're going to lose our tuskfish.

46:42.560 --> 46:46.160
It's incredibly sad to see areas
that you've dived on

46:46.240 --> 46:49.440
since you were a little kid
just turn to rubble.

46:52.600 --> 46:54.720
I cried in my mask, when I saw,

46:54.800 --> 46:56.920
you know, some of the devastation
from this bleaching.

47:04.840 --> 47:06.720
In the last three years,

47:06.800 --> 47:09.720
over two-thirds
of the world's coral reefs

47:09.840 --> 47:13.520
are thought to have suffered from rises
in ocean temperatures.

47:26.320 --> 47:28.680
This is not the only challenge
they face.

47:31.360 --> 47:33.800
Research is revealing
how the fundamental

47:33.880 --> 47:36.160
chemistry of the ocean is changing.

47:39.680 --> 47:42.880
Professor Chris Langdon shows me
what this might mean

47:42.960 --> 47:47.840
for the future of our seas
by pouring dilute acid over shells.

47:52.840 --> 47:56.480
And how much more acidic is this
than the present ocean?

47:57.120 --> 48:00.600
CHRIS: This is more concentrated than
the pH of the ocean

48:01.200 --> 48:04.480
but it accelerates the process
so we can see something visually.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.280
So, what's happening is, these shells,
they're made out of calcium carbonate,

48:09.000 --> 48:10.560
and the acid is dissolving them.

48:11.160 --> 48:14.920
And coral reefs are made out of
the same material as these shells here.

48:15.840 --> 48:19.840
But surely this is not happening
in the ocean now. Right now?

48:19.920 --> 48:23.400
What we're seeing here is more dramatic
than what's happening in the ocean.

48:23.480 --> 48:28.160
But the shells and the reefs
are really truly dissolving.

48:28.240 --> 48:31.360
Coral reefs could be gone by the end
of this century.

48:34.560 --> 48:38.040
And the cause of this?
Carbon dioxide.

48:39.800 --> 48:43.280
Dissolved in the sea water,
it forms carbonic acid.

48:44.200 --> 48:46.720
The more carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere,

48:46.800 --> 48:49.120
the more acidic the ocean becomes.

48:51.320 --> 48:54.120
Evidence points to the burning
of fossil fuels

48:54.240 --> 48:58.800
as the primary cause for these
increasing levels of carbon dioxide.

49:00.640 --> 49:03.200
And this is man-made beyond question.

49:03.280 --> 49:04.480
Beyond question.

49:08.600 --> 49:11.680
But Chris believes all is not lost.

49:13.200 --> 49:17.160
All we have to do, and I say all,
is reduce our CO2 emissions.

49:17.240 --> 49:21.360
We can switch to renewable fuels,
wind and solar,

49:21.440 --> 49:23.400
instead of natural fossil fuels.

49:23.480 --> 49:25.160
And so, none of this has to

49:26.080 --> 49:28.480
-develop to the worst case.
-And that could fix it?

49:28.560 --> 49:33.160
Yeah, absolutely. So, this future does
not have to play out. It's up to us.

49:39.360 --> 49:41.360
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

49:44.080 --> 49:47.680
As the climate changes,
the seas warm.

49:47.800 --> 49:50.680
Our oceans are being seriously affected.

49:53.240 --> 49:57.560
And this is nowhere more apparent
than at the poles.

50:06.520 --> 50:08.120
Antarctica.

50:12.040 --> 50:16.560
For the Blue Planet II team, this was
their most ambitious expedition.

50:19.240 --> 50:23.120
For the first time in history,
a manned submersible

50:23.200 --> 50:26.680
will try to dive to a depth
of 1,000 metres

50:26.760 --> 50:29.160
and reach the Antarctic seabed.

50:30.560 --> 50:33.360
A true journey into the unknown.

50:59.280 --> 51:02.240
Leading the team
on this historic dive

51:02.320 --> 51:04.560
is deep sea scientist John Copley.

51:12.360 --> 51:15.920
We get our first glimpse
of this landscape.

51:18.640 --> 51:22.280
And the carpet of life around us
is astounding.

51:23.040 --> 51:24.320
It's beautiful.

51:33.280 --> 51:38.000
Diving in a submersible
gives John an entirely new understanding

51:38.080 --> 51:40.760
of how this rich ecosystem works.

51:42.480 --> 51:45.560
But it also offers him
a unique opportunity

51:45.640 --> 51:48.560
to investigate how the ocean here
is changing.

51:49.840 --> 51:51.800
While we're observing the marine life
down there,

51:51.880 --> 51:54.200
the subs are also recording
what the environment is like,

51:54.280 --> 51:56.640
so we're getting measurements
of temperature, of salinity.

51:56.720 --> 51:59.000
It's hopefully gonna enable us
to understand the changes

51:59.080 --> 52:01.240
that are happening in this vital part
of our planet.

52:04.280 --> 52:06.880
To get a fuller picture,
John also lowers

52:06.960 --> 52:09.200
a deep sea temperature probe.

52:14.520 --> 52:18.200
His data is contributing
to an international attempt

52:18.280 --> 52:21.920
to chart the rise in both sea
and air temperatures.

52:25.080 --> 52:27.240
What shocks me about
what all the data show

52:27.360 --> 52:29.880
is how fast things are changing here.

52:32.520 --> 52:35.320
We're headed into uncharted territory.

52:42.520 --> 52:44.560
To truly comprehend

52:44.640 --> 52:46.840
the effect of the temperature
increases here,

52:46.920 --> 52:49.040
John takes to the skies.

52:50.200 --> 52:53.520
From here, he can record
the number and size

52:53.600 --> 52:58.080
of the icebergs being produced
as the ice shelves melt and break apart.

53:00.640 --> 53:04.080
The bergs we're seeing all around us
give you some idea

53:04.160 --> 53:08.520
of how huge this process is
that's taking place on the Antarctic.

53:09.840 --> 53:13.560
As the floating shelves
break up, they allow water,

53:13.640 --> 53:17.120
which has been locked up on land as ice
for thousands of years,

53:17.200 --> 53:19.000
to empty into the sea.

53:20.840 --> 53:24.080
And this is predicted to push up
sea levels.

53:28.560 --> 53:31.760
If the ice shelves break up,
then that opens the flood gates.

53:32.600 --> 53:34.720
Ice on land flows faster into the sea

53:34.800 --> 53:36.440
and that's what pushes up
the sea levels.

53:38.360 --> 53:42.120
So, what's happening here right now
affects all of us.

53:56.520 --> 54:00.520
Already, cities like Miami here
are under threat.

54:01.400 --> 54:04.560
Scientists predict that by the end
of the century,

54:04.640 --> 54:08.440
the sea levels could have risen
by a metre or even two.

54:09.080 --> 54:13.640
Were that to happen, parts of this city
would certainly be submerged.

54:18.360 --> 54:22.920
Around the world, hundreds of millions
of people live near the coast,

54:23.000 --> 54:27.520
and as sea levels rise,
their lives will be seriously affected.

54:40.760 --> 54:44.800
It's now clear that our actions
are having a significant impact

54:44.880 --> 54:46.640
on the world's oceans.

54:51.320 --> 54:54.760
During the four years it took
to make this series,

54:54.840 --> 54:57.920
we've witnessed many of these changes
first-hand.

55:06.800 --> 55:09.880
But we've also worked alongside
men and women

55:09.960 --> 55:13.720
dedicating their lives to safeguarding
the ocean's future.

55:21.200 --> 55:24.440
LUCY: The oceans provide us with oxygen,

55:24.520 --> 55:26.480
they regulate temperature,

55:26.560 --> 55:29.600
they provide us with food
and energy supplies.

55:30.240 --> 55:35.080
And it's unthinkable to have a world
without a healthy ocean.

55:38.960 --> 55:41.720
CHRIS: I still think we have
the capability

55:41.800 --> 55:44.880
to change the manner in which
we're wasting resources,

55:44.960 --> 55:46.920
in which we're poisoning our oceans,

55:47.040 --> 55:50.600
and we can look to a future
with healthy oceans.

55:53.120 --> 55:57.600
LEN: When I look forward, I believe
that if what we are doing

55:57.680 --> 56:00.120
can be duplicated just a little bit.

56:00.240 --> 56:03.080
These animals will have a chance
of surviving.

56:04.640 --> 56:09.040
JOHN: It comes down, I think, to us each
taking responsibility

56:09.160 --> 56:11.760
for the personal choices that we make
in our everyday lives.

56:11.840 --> 56:14.680
That's all any of us can be expected
to do.

56:14.760 --> 56:17.320
And it is those everyday choices
that add up.

56:32.760 --> 56:35.680
We are at a unique stage in our history.

56:36.600 --> 56:40.520
Never before have we had
such an awareness

56:40.600 --> 56:42.560
of what we are doing to the planet.

56:43.600 --> 56:48.640
And never before have we had the power
to do something about that.

56:50.720 --> 56:54.560
Surely, we have a responsibility
to care for our blue planet.

56:55.680 --> 56:58.480
The future of humanity,

56:58.560 --> 57:01.800
and indeed all life on Earth,

57:01.880 --> 57:04.160
now depends on us.
